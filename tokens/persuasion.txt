*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
Elliot
,
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
in
Somersetshire
,
was
a
man
who
,
*NL*
for
his
own
amusement
,
never
took
up
any
book
but
the
Baronetage
;
there
*NL*
he
found
occupation
for
an
idle
hour
,
and
consolation
in
a
distressed
*NL*
one
;
there
his
faculties
were
roused
into
admiration
and
respect
,
by
*NL*
contemplating
the
limited
remnant
of
the
earliest
patents
;
there
any
*NL*
unwelcome
sensations
,
arising
from
domestic
affairs
changed
naturally
*NL*
into
pity
and
contempt
as
he
turned
over
the
almost
endless
creations
*NL*
of
the
last
century
;
and
there
,
if
every
other
leaf
were
powerless
,
he
*NL*
could
read
his
own
history
with
an
interest
which
never
failed
.
This
*NL*
was
the
page
at
which
the
favourite
volume
always
opened

*NL*
Precisely
such
had
the
paragraph
originally
stood
from
the
printer
's
*NL*
hands
;
but
Sir
Walter
had
improved
it
by
adding
,
for
the
information
of
*NL*
himself
and
his
family
,
these
words
,
after
the
date
of
Mary
's
birth
--

``

''
and
by
inserting
most
*NL*
accurately
the
day
of
the
month
on
which
he
had
lost
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
followed
the
history
and
rise
of
the
ancient
and
respectable
*NL*
family
,
in
the
usual
terms
;
how
it
had
been
first
settled
in
Cheshire
;
*NL*
how
mentioned
in
Dugdale
,
serving
the
office
of
high
sheriff
,
*NL*
representing
a
borough
in
three
successive
parliaments
,
exertions
of
*NL*
loyalty
,
and
dignity
of
baronet
,
in
the
first
year
of
Charles
II
,
with
*NL*
all
the
Marys
and
Elizabeths
they
had
married
;
forming
altogether
two
*NL*
handsome
duodecimo
pages
,
and
concluding
with
the
arms
and
*NL*
motto
:
--
``
Principal
seat
,
Kellynch
Hall
,
in
the
county
of
Somerset
,
''
and
*NL*
Sir
Walter
's
handwriting
again
in
this
finale
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heir
presumptive
,
William
Walter
Elliot
,
Esq.
,
great
grandson
of
the
*NL*
second
Sir
Walter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vanity
was
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
Sir
Walter
Elliot
's
character
;
*NL*
vanity
of
person
and
of
situation
.
He
had
been
remarkably
handsome
in
*NL*
his
youth
;
and
,
at
fifty-four
,
was
still
a
very
fine
man
.
Few
women
*NL*
could
think
more
of
their
personal
appearance
than
he
did
,
nor
could
*NL*
the
valet
of
any
new
made
lord
be
more
delighted
with
the
place
he
held
*NL*
in
society
.
He
considered
the
blessing
of
beauty
as
inferior
only
to
*NL*
the
blessing
of
a
baronetcy
;
and
the
Sir
Walter
Elliot
,
who
united
*NL*
these
gifts
,
was
the
constant
object
of
his
warmest
respect
and
*NL*
devotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
good
looks
and
his
rank
had
one
fair
claim
on
his
attachment
;
since
*NL*
to
them
he
must
have
owed
a
wife
of
very
superior
character
to
any
*NL*
thing
deserved
by
his
own
.
Lady
Elliot
had
been
an
excellent
woman
,
*NL*
sensible
and
amiable
;
whose
judgement
and
conduct
,
if
they
might
be
*NL*
pardoned
the
youthful
infatuation
which
made
her
Lady
Elliot
,
had
never
*NL*
required
indulgence
afterwards
.
--
She
had
humoured
,
or
softened
,
or
*NL*
concealed
his
failings
,
and
promoted
his
real
respectability
for
*NL*
seventeen
years
;
and
though
not
the
very
happiest
being
in
the
world
*NL*
herself
,
had
found
enough
in
her
duties
,
her
friends
,
and
her
children
,
*NL*
to
attach
her
to
life
,
and
make
it
no
matter
of
indifference
to
her
*NL*
when
she
was
called
on
to
quit
them
.
--
Three
girls
,
the
two
eldest
*NL*
sixteen
and
fourteen
,
was
an
awful
legacy
for
a
mother
to
bequeath
,
an
*NL*
awful
charge
rather
,
to
confide
to
the
authority
and
guidance
of
a
*NL*
conceited
,
silly
father
.
She
had
,
however
,
one
very
intimate
friend
,
a
*NL*
sensible
,
deserving
woman
,
who
had
been
brought
,
by
strong
attachment
*NL*
to
herself
,
to
settle
close
by
her
,
in
the
village
of
Kellynch
;
and
on
*NL*
her
kindness
and
advice
,
Lady
Elliot
mainly
relied
for
the
best
help
*NL*
and
maintenance
of
the
good
principles
and
instruction
which
she
had
*NL*
been
anxiously
giving
her
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
friend
,
and
Sir
Walter
,
did
not
marry
,
whatever
might
have
been
*NL*
anticipated
on
that
head
by
their
acquaintance
.
Thirteen
years
had
*NL*
passed
away
since
Lady
Elliot
's
death
,
and
they
were
still
near
*NL*
neighbours
and
intimate
friends
,
and
one
remained
a
widower
,
the
other
*NL*
a
widow
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
Lady
Russell
,
of
steady
age
and
character
,
and
extremely
well
*NL*
provided
for
,
should
have
no
thought
of
a
second
marriage
,
needs
no
*NL*
apology
to
the
public
,
which
is
rather
apt
to
be
unreasonably
*NL*
discontented
when
a
woman
does
marry
again
,
than
when
she
does
not
;
but
*NL*
Sir
Walter
's
continuing
in
singleness
requires
explanation
.
Be
it
*NL*
known
then
,
that
Sir
Walter
,
like
a
good
father
,
-LRB-
having
met
with
one
*NL*
or
two
private
disappointments
in
very
unreasonable
applications
-RRB-
,
*NL*
prided
himself
on
remaining
single
for
his
dear
daughters
'
sake
.
For
*NL*
one
daughter
,
his
eldest
,
he
would
really
have
given
up
any
thing
,
*NL*
which
he
had
not
been
very
much
tempted
to
do
.
Elizabeth
had
*NL*
succeeded
,
at
sixteen
,
to
all
that
was
possible
,
of
her
mother
's
rights
*NL*
and
consequence
;
and
being
very
handsome
,
and
very
like
himself
,
her
*NL*
influence
had
always
been
great
,
and
they
had
gone
on
together
most
*NL*
happily
.
His
two
other
children
were
of
very
inferior
value
.
Mary
had
*NL*
acquired
a
little
artificial
importance
,
by
becoming
Mrs
Charles
*NL*
Musgrove
;
but
Anne
,
with
an
elegance
of
mind
and
sweetness
of
*NL*
character
,
which
must
have
placed
her
high
with
any
people
of
real
*NL*
understanding
,
was
nobody
with
either
father
or
sister
;
her
word
had
no
*NL*
weight
,
her
convenience
was
always
to
give
way
--
she
was
only
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Lady
Russell
,
indeed
,
she
was
a
most
dear
and
highly
valued
*NL*
god-daughter
,
favourite
,
and
friend
.
Lady
Russell
loved
them
all
;
but
*NL*
it
was
only
in
Anne
that
she
could
fancy
the
mother
to
revive
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
years
before
,
Anne
Elliot
had
been
a
very
pretty
girl
,
but
her
*NL*
bloom
had
vanished
early
;
and
as
even
in
its
height
,
her
father
had
*NL*
found
little
to
admire
in
her
,
-LRB-
so
totally
different
were
her
delicate
*NL*
features
and
mild
dark
eyes
from
his
own
-RRB-
,
there
could
be
nothing
in
*NL*
them
,
now
that
she
was
faded
and
thin
,
to
excite
his
esteem
.
He
had
*NL*
never
indulged
much
hope
,
he
had
now
none
,
of
ever
reading
her
name
in
*NL*
any
other
page
of
his
favourite
work
.
All
equality
of
alliance
must
*NL*
rest
with
Elizabeth
,
for
Mary
had
merely
connected
herself
with
an
old
*NL*
country
family
of
respectability
and
large
fortune
,
and
had
therefore
*NL*
given
all
the
honour
and
received
none
:
Elizabeth
would
,
one
day
or
*NL*
other
,
marry
suitably
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
sometimes
happens
that
a
woman
is
handsomer
at
twenty-nine
than
she
*NL*
was
ten
years
before
;
and
,
generally
speaking
,
if
there
has
been
*NL*
neither
ill
health
nor
anxiety
,
it
is
a
time
of
life
at
which
scarcely
*NL*
any
charm
is
lost
.
It
was
so
with
Elizabeth
,
still
the
same
handsome
*NL*
Miss
Elliot
that
she
had
begun
to
be
thirteen
years
ago
,
and
Sir
Walter
*NL*
might
be
excused
,
therefore
,
in
forgetting
her
age
,
or
,
at
least
,
be
*NL*
deemed
only
half
a
fool
,
for
thinking
himself
and
Elizabeth
as
blooming
*NL*
as
ever
,
amidst
the
wreck
of
the
good
looks
of
everybody
else
;
for
he
*NL*
could
plainly
see
how
old
all
the
rest
of
his
family
and
acquaintance
*NL*
were
growing
.
Anne
haggard
,
Mary
coarse
,
every
face
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
worsting
,
and
the
rapid
increase
of
the
crow
's
foot
about
*NL*
Lady
Russell
's
temples
had
long
been
a
distress
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
did
not
quite
equal
her
father
in
personal
contentment
.
*NL*
Thirteen
years
had
seen
her
mistress
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
presiding
and
*NL*
directing
with
a
self-possession
and
decision
which
could
never
have
*NL*
given
the
idea
of
her
being
younger
than
she
was
.
For
thirteen
years
*NL*
had
she
been
doing
the
honours
,
and
laying
down
the
domestic
law
at
*NL*
home
,
and
leading
the
way
to
the
chaise
and
four
,
and
walking
*NL*
immediately
after
Lady
Russell
out
of
all
the
drawing-rooms
and
*NL*
dining-rooms
in
the
country
.
Thirteen
winters
'
revolving
frosts
had
*NL*
seen
her
opening
every
ball
of
credit
which
a
scanty
neighbourhood
*NL*
afforded
,
and
thirteen
springs
shewn
their
blossoms
,
as
she
travelled
*NL*
up
to
London
with
her
father
,
for
a
few
weeks
'
annual
enjoyment
of
the
*NL*
great
world
.
She
had
the
remembrance
of
all
this
,
she
had
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
being
nine-and-twenty
to
give
her
some
regrets
and
*NL*
some
apprehensions
;
she
was
fully
satisfied
of
being
still
quite
as
*NL*
handsome
as
ever
,
but
she
felt
her
approach
to
the
years
of
danger
,
and
*NL*
would
have
rejoiced
to
be
certain
of
being
properly
solicited
by
*NL*
baronet-blood
within
the
next
twelvemonth
or
two
.
Then
might
she
again
*NL*
take
up
the
book
of
books
with
as
much
enjoyment
as
in
her
early
youth
,
*NL*
but
now
she
liked
it
not
.
Always
to
be
presented
with
the
date
of
her
*NL*
own
birth
and
see
no
marriage
follow
but
that
of
a
youngest
sister
,
*NL*
made
the
book
an
evil
;
and
more
than
once
,
when
her
father
had
left
it
*NL*
open
on
the
table
near
her
,
had
she
closed
it
,
with
averted
eyes
,
and
*NL*
pushed
it
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
had
a
disappointment
,
moreover
,
which
that
book
,
and
especially
*NL*
the
history
of
her
own
family
,
must
ever
present
the
remembrance
of
.
*NL*
The
heir
presumptive
,
the
very
William
Walter
Elliot
,
Esq.
,
whose
*NL*
rights
had
been
so
generously
supported
by
her
father
,
had
disappointed
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
,
while
a
very
young
girl
,
as
soon
as
she
had
known
him
to
be
,
*NL*
in
the
event
of
her
having
no
brother
,
the
future
baronet
,
meant
to
*NL*
marry
him
,
and
her
father
had
always
meant
that
she
should
.
He
had
not
*NL*
been
known
to
them
as
a
boy
;
but
soon
after
Lady
Elliot
's
death
,
Sir
*NL*
Walter
had
sought
the
acquaintance
,
and
though
his
overtures
had
not
*NL*
been
met
with
any
warmth
,
he
had
persevered
in
seeking
it
,
making
*NL*
allowance
for
the
modest
drawing-back
of
youth
;
and
,
in
one
of
their
*NL*
spring
excursions
to
London
,
when
Elizabeth
was
in
her
first
bloom
,
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
had
been
forced
into
the
introduction
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
at
that
time
a
very
young
man
,
just
engaged
in
the
study
of
the
*NL*
law
;
and
Elizabeth
found
him
extremely
agreeable
,
and
every
plan
in
his
*NL*
favour
was
confirmed
.
He
was
invited
to
Kellynch
Hall
;
he
was
talked
*NL*
of
and
expected
all
the
rest
of
the
year
;
but
he
never
came
.
The
*NL*
following
spring
he
was
seen
again
in
town
,
found
equally
agreeable
,
*NL*
again
encouraged
,
invited
,
and
expected
,
and
again
he
did
not
come
;
and
*NL*
the
next
tidings
were
that
he
was
married
.
Instead
of
pushing
his
*NL*
fortune
in
the
line
marked
out
for
the
heir
of
the
house
of
Elliot
,
he
*NL*
had
purchased
independence
by
uniting
himself
to
a
rich
woman
of
*NL*
inferior
birth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
had
resented
it
.
As
the
head
of
the
house
,
he
felt
that
he
*NL*
ought
to
have
been
consulted
,
especially
after
taking
the
young
man
so
*NL*
publicly
by
the
hand
;
``
For
they
must
have
been
seen
together
,
''
he
*NL*
observed
,
``
once
at
Tattersall
's
,
and
twice
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
of
*NL*
Commons
.
''
His
disapprobation
was
expressed
,
but
apparently
very
little
*NL*
regarded
.
Mr
Elliot
had
attempted
no
apology
,
and
shewn
himself
as
*NL*
unsolicitous
of
being
longer
noticed
by
the
family
,
as
Sir
Walter
*NL*
considered
him
unworthy
of
it
:
all
acquaintance
between
them
had
*NL*
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
very
awkward
history
of
Mr
Elliot
was
still
,
after
an
interval
of
*NL*
several
years
,
felt
with
anger
by
Elizabeth
,
who
had
liked
the
man
for
*NL*
himself
,
and
still
more
for
being
her
father
's
heir
,
and
whose
strong
*NL*
family
pride
could
see
only
in
him
a
proper
match
for
Sir
Walter
*NL*
Elliot
's
eldest
daughter
.
There
was
not
a
baronet
from
A
to
Z
whom
her
*NL*
feelings
could
have
so
willingly
acknowledged
as
an
equal
.
Yet
so
*NL*
miserably
had
he
conducted
himself
,
that
though
she
was
at
this
present
*NL*
time
-LRB-
the
summer
of
1814
-RRB-
wearing
black
ribbons
for
his
wife
,
she
could
*NL*
not
admit
him
to
be
worth
thinking
of
again
.
The
disgrace
of
his
first
*NL*
marriage
might
,
perhaps
,
as
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
it
*NL*
perpetuated
by
offspring
,
have
been
got
over
,
had
he
not
done
worse
;
*NL*
but
he
had
,
as
by
the
accustomary
intervention
of
kind
friends
,
they
*NL*
had
been
informed
,
spoken
most
disrespectfully
of
them
all
,
most
*NL*
slightingly
and
contemptuously
of
the
very
blood
he
belonged
to
,
and
*NL*
the
honours
which
were
hereafter
to
be
his
own
.
This
could
not
be
*NL*
pardoned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
Elizabeth
Elliot
's
sentiments
and
sensations
;
such
the
cares
*NL*
to
alloy
,
the
agitations
to
vary
,
the
sameness
and
the
elegance
,
the
*NL*
prosperity
and
the
nothingness
of
her
scene
of
life
;
such
the
feelings
*NL*
to
give
interest
to
a
long
,
uneventful
residence
in
one
country
circle
,
*NL*
to
fill
the
vacancies
which
there
were
no
habits
of
utility
abroad
,
no
*NL*
talents
or
accomplishments
for
home
,
to
occupy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
,
another
occupation
and
solicitude
of
mind
was
beginning
to
be
*NL*
added
to
these
.
Her
father
was
growing
distressed
for
money
.
She
*NL*
knew
,
that
when
he
now
took
up
the
Baronetage
,
it
was
to
drive
the
*NL*
heavy
bills
of
his
tradespeople
,
and
the
unwelcome
hints
of
Mr
*NL*
Shepherd
,
his
agent
,
from
his
thoughts
.
The
Kellynch
property
was
*NL*
good
,
but
not
equal
to
Sir
Walter
's
apprehension
of
the
state
required
*NL*
in
its
possessor
.
While
Lady
Elliot
lived
,
there
had
been
method
,
*NL*
moderation
,
and
economy
,
which
had
just
kept
him
within
his
income
;
but
*NL*
with
her
had
died
all
such
right-mindedness
,
and
from
that
period
he
*NL*
had
been
constantly
exceeding
it
.
It
had
not
been
possible
for
him
to
*NL*
spend
less
;
he
had
done
nothing
but
what
Sir
Walter
Elliot
was
*NL*
imperiously
called
on
to
do
;
but
blameless
as
he
was
,
he
was
not
only
*NL*
growing
dreadfully
in
debt
,
but
was
hearing
of
it
so
often
,
that
it
*NL*
became
vain
to
attempt
concealing
it
longer
,
even
partially
,
from
his
*NL*
daughter
.
He
had
given
her
some
hints
of
it
the
last
spring
in
town
;
*NL*
he
had
gone
so
far
even
as
to
say
,
``
Can
we
retrench
?
Does
it
occur
to
*NL*
you
that
there
is
any
one
article
in
which
we
can
retrench
?
''
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
to
do
her
justice
,
had
,
in
the
first
ardour
of
female
alarm
,
*NL*
set
seriously
to
think
what
could
be
done
,
and
had
finally
proposed
*NL*
these
two
branches
of
economy
,
to
cut
off
some
unnecessary
charities
,
*NL*
and
to
refrain
from
new
furnishing
the
drawing-room
;
to
which
*NL*
expedients
she
afterwards
added
the
happy
thought
of
their
taking
no
*NL*
present
down
to
Anne
,
as
had
been
the
usual
yearly
custom
.
But
these
*NL*
measures
,
however
good
in
themselves
,
were
insufficient
for
the
real
*NL*
extent
of
the
evil
,
the
whole
of
which
Sir
Walter
found
himself
obliged
*NL*
to
confess
to
her
soon
afterwards
.
Elizabeth
had
nothing
to
propose
of
*NL*
deeper
efficacy
.
She
felt
herself
ill-used
and
unfortunate
,
as
did
her
*NL*
father
;
and
they
were
neither
of
them
able
to
devise
any
means
of
*NL*
lessening
their
expenses
without
compromising
their
dignity
,
or
*NL*
relinquishing
their
comforts
in
a
way
not
to
be
borne
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
only
a
small
part
of
his
estate
that
Sir
Walter
could
dispose
*NL*
of
;
but
had
every
acre
been
alienable
,
it
would
have
made
no
*NL*
difference
.
He
had
condescended
to
mortgage
as
far
as
he
had
the
*NL*
power
,
but
he
would
never
condescend
to
sell
.
No
;
he
would
never
*NL*
disgrace
his
name
so
far
.
The
Kellynch
estate
should
be
transmitted
*NL*
whole
and
entire
,
as
he
had
received
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
two
confidential
friends
,
Mr
Shepherd
,
who
lived
in
the
*NL*
neighbouring
market
town
,
and
Lady
Russell
,
were
called
to
advise
them
;
*NL*
and
both
father
and
daughter
seemed
to
expect
that
something
should
be
*NL*
struck
out
by
one
or
the
other
to
remove
their
embarrassments
and
*NL*
reduce
their
expenditure
,
without
involving
the
loss
of
any
indulgence
*NL*
of
taste
or
pride
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Shepherd
,
a
civil
,
cautious
lawyer
,
who
,
whatever
might
be
his
hold
*NL*
or
his
views
on
Sir
Walter
,
would
rather
have
the
disagreeable
prompted
*NL*
by
anybody
else
,
excused
himself
from
offering
the
slightest
hint
,
and
*NL*
only
begged
leave
to
recommend
an
implicit
reference
to
the
excellent
*NL*
judgement
of
Lady
Russell
,
from
whose
known
good
sense
he
fully
*NL*
expected
to
have
just
such
resolute
measures
advised
as
he
meant
to
see
*NL*
finally
adopted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
was
most
anxiously
zealous
on
the
subject
,
and
gave
it
*NL*
much
serious
consideration
.
She
was
a
woman
rather
of
sound
than
of
*NL*
quick
abilities
,
whose
difficulties
in
coming
to
any
decision
in
this
*NL*
instance
were
great
,
from
the
opposition
of
two
leading
principles
.
*NL*
She
was
of
strict
integrity
herself
,
with
a
delicate
sense
of
honour
;
*NL*
but
she
was
as
desirous
of
saving
Sir
Walter
's
feelings
,
as
solicitous
*NL*
for
the
credit
of
the
family
,
as
aristocratic
in
her
ideas
of
what
was
*NL*
due
to
them
,
as
anybody
of
sense
and
honesty
could
well
be
.
She
was
a
*NL*
benevolent
,
charitable
,
good
woman
,
and
capable
of
strong
attachments
,
*NL*
most
correct
in
her
conduct
,
strict
in
her
notions
of
decorum
,
and
with
*NL*
manners
that
were
held
a
standard
of
good-breeding
.
She
had
a
*NL*
cultivated
mind
,
and
was
,
generally
speaking
,
rational
and
consistent
;
*NL*
but
she
had
prejudices
on
the
side
of
ancestry
;
she
had
a
value
for
*NL*
rank
and
consequence
,
which
blinded
her
a
little
to
the
faults
of
those
*NL*
who
possessed
them
.
Herself
the
widow
of
only
a
knight
,
she
gave
the
*NL*
dignity
of
a
baronet
all
its
due
;
and
Sir
Walter
,
independent
of
his
*NL*
claims
as
an
old
acquaintance
,
an
attentive
neighbour
,
an
obliging
*NL*
landlord
,
the
husband
of
her
very
dear
friend
,
the
father
of
Anne
and
*NL*
her
sisters
,
was
,
as
being
Sir
Walter
,
in
her
apprehension
,
entitled
to
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
compassion
and
consideration
under
his
present
*NL*
difficulties
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
must
retrench
;
that
did
not
admit
of
a
doubt
.
But
she
was
very
*NL*
anxious
to
have
it
done
with
the
least
possible
pain
to
him
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
.
She
drew
up
plans
of
economy
,
she
made
exact
calculations
,
*NL*
and
she
did
what
nobody
else
thought
of
doing
:
she
consulted
Anne
,
who
*NL*
never
seemed
considered
by
the
others
as
having
any
interest
in
the
*NL*
question
.
She
consulted
,
and
in
a
degree
was
influenced
by
her
in
*NL*
marking
out
the
scheme
of
retrenchment
which
was
at
last
submitted
to
*NL*
Sir
Walter
.
Every
emendation
of
Anne
's
had
been
on
the
side
of
honesty
*NL*
against
importance
.
She
wanted
more
vigorous
measures
,
a
more
complete
*NL*
reformation
,
a
quicker
release
from
debt
,
a
much
higher
tone
of
*NL*
indifference
for
everything
but
justice
and
equity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
can
persuade
your
father
to
all
this
,
''
said
Lady
Russell
,
*NL*
looking
over
her
paper
,
``
much
may
be
done
.
If
he
will
adopt
these
*NL*
regulations
,
in
seven
years
he
will
be
clear
;
and
I
hope
we
may
be
able
*NL*
to
convince
him
and
Elizabeth
,
that
Kellynch
Hall
has
a
respectability
*NL*
in
itself
which
can
not
be
affected
by
these
reductions
;
and
that
the
*NL*
true
dignity
of
Sir
Walter
Elliot
will
be
very
far
from
lessened
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
sensible
people
,
by
acting
like
a
man
of
principle
.
What
will
*NL*
he
be
doing
,
in
fact
,
but
what
very
many
of
our
first
families
have
*NL*
done
,
or
ought
to
do
?
There
will
be
nothing
singular
in
his
case
;
and
*NL*
it
is
singularity
which
often
makes
the
worst
part
of
our
suffering
,
as
*NL*
it
always
does
of
our
conduct
.
I
have
great
hope
of
prevailing
.
We
*NL*
must
be
serious
and
decided
;
for
after
all
,
the
person
who
has
*NL*
contracted
debts
must
pay
them
;
and
though
a
great
deal
is
due
to
the
*NL*
feelings
of
the
gentleman
,
and
the
head
of
a
house
,
like
your
father
,
*NL*
there
is
still
more
due
to
the
character
of
an
honest
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
principle
on
which
Anne
wanted
her
father
to
be
*NL*
proceeding
,
his
friends
to
be
urging
him
.
She
considered
it
as
an
act
*NL*
of
indispensable
duty
to
clear
away
the
claims
of
creditors
with
all
*NL*
the
expedition
which
the
most
comprehensive
retrenchments
could
secure
,
*NL*
and
saw
no
dignity
in
anything
short
of
it
.
She
wanted
it
to
be
*NL*
prescribed
,
and
felt
as
a
duty
.
She
rated
Lady
Russell
's
influence
*NL*
highly
;
and
as
to
the
severe
degree
of
self-denial
which
her
own
*NL*
conscience
prompted
,
she
believed
there
might
be
little
more
difficulty
*NL*
in
persuading
them
to
a
complete
,
than
to
half
a
reformation
.
Her
*NL*
knowledge
of
her
father
and
Elizabeth
inclined
her
to
think
that
the
*NL*
sacrifice
of
one
pair
of
horses
would
be
hardly
less
painful
than
of
*NL*
both
,
and
so
on
,
through
the
whole
list
of
Lady
Russell
's
too
gentle
*NL*
reductions
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
Anne
's
more
rigid
requisitions
might
have
been
taken
is
of
little
*NL*
consequence
.
Lady
Russell
's
had
no
success
at
all
:
could
not
be
put
up
*NL*
with
,
were
not
to
be
borne
.
``
What
!
every
comfort
of
life
knocked
off
!
*NL*
Journeys
,
London
,
servants
,
horses
,
table
--
contractions
and
*NL*
restrictions
every
where
!
To
live
no
longer
with
the
decencies
even
of
*NL*
a
private
gentleman
!
No
,
he
would
sooner
quit
Kellynch
Hall
at
once
,
*NL*
than
remain
in
it
on
such
disgraceful
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quit
Kellynch
Hall
.
''
The
hint
was
immediately
taken
up
by
Mr
*NL*
Shepherd
,
whose
interest
was
involved
in
the
reality
of
Sir
Walter
's
*NL*
retrenching
,
and
who
was
perfectly
persuaded
that
nothing
would
be
done
*NL*
without
a
change
of
abode
.
``
Since
the
idea
had
been
started
in
the
*NL*
very
quarter
which
ought
to
dictate
,
he
had
no
scruple
,
''
he
said
,
``
in
*NL*
confessing
his
judgement
to
be
entirely
on
that
side
.
It
did
not
*NL*
appear
to
him
that
Sir
Walter
could
materially
alter
his
style
of
*NL*
living
in
a
house
which
had
such
a
character
of
hospitality
and
ancient
*NL*
dignity
to
support
.
In
any
other
place
Sir
Walter
might
judge
for
*NL*
himself
;
and
would
be
looked
up
to
,
as
regulating
the
modes
of
life
in
*NL*
whatever
way
he
might
choose
to
model
his
household
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
would
quit
Kellynch
Hall
;
and
after
a
very
few
days
more
of
*NL*
doubt
and
indecision
,
the
great
question
of
whither
he
should
go
was
*NL*
settled
,
and
the
first
outline
of
this
important
change
made
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
three
alternatives
,
London
,
Bath
,
or
another
house
in
*NL*
the
country
.
All
Anne
's
wishes
had
been
for
the
latter
.
A
small
house
*NL*
in
their
own
neighbourhood
,
where
they
might
still
have
Lady
Russell
's
*NL*
society
,
still
be
near
Mary
,
and
still
have
the
pleasure
of
sometimes
*NL*
seeing
the
lawns
and
groves
of
Kellynch
,
was
the
object
of
her
*NL*
ambition
.
But
the
usual
fate
of
Anne
attended
her
,
in
having
something
*NL*
very
opposite
from
her
inclination
fixed
on
.
She
disliked
Bath
,
and
*NL*
did
not
think
it
agreed
with
her
;
and
Bath
was
to
be
her
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
had
at
first
thought
more
of
London
;
but
Mr
Shepherd
felt
*NL*
that
he
could
not
be
trusted
in
London
,
and
had
been
skilful
enough
to
*NL*
dissuade
him
from
it
,
and
make
Bath
preferred
.
It
was
a
much
safer
*NL*
place
for
a
gentleman
in
his
predicament
:
he
might
there
be
important
*NL*
at
comparatively
little
expense
.
Two
material
advantages
of
Bath
over
*NL*
London
had
of
course
been
given
all
their
weight
:
its
more
convenient
*NL*
distance
from
Kellynch
,
only
fifty
miles
,
and
Lady
Russell
's
spending
*NL*
some
part
of
every
winter
there
;
and
to
the
very
great
satisfaction
of
*NL*
Lady
Russell
,
whose
first
views
on
the
projected
change
had
been
for
*NL*
Bath
,
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
were
induced
to
believe
that
they
should
*NL*
lose
neither
consequence
nor
enjoyment
by
settling
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
felt
obliged
to
oppose
her
dear
Anne
's
known
wishes
.
It
*NL*
would
be
too
much
to
expect
Sir
Walter
to
descend
into
a
small
house
in
*NL*
his
own
neighbourhood
.
Anne
herself
would
have
found
the
*NL*
mortifications
of
it
more
than
she
foresaw
,
and
to
Sir
Walter
's
*NL*
feelings
they
must
have
been
dreadful
.
And
with
regard
to
Anne
's
*NL*
dislike
of
Bath
,
she
considered
it
as
a
prejudice
and
mistake
arising
,
*NL*
first
,
from
the
circumstance
of
her
having
been
three
years
at
school
*NL*
there
,
after
her
mother
's
death
;
and
secondly
,
from
her
happening
to
be
*NL*
not
in
perfectly
good
spirits
the
only
winter
which
she
had
afterwards
*NL*
spent
there
with
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
was
fond
of
Bath
,
in
short
,
and
disposed
to
think
it
must
*NL*
suit
them
all
;
and
as
to
her
young
friend
's
health
,
by
passing
all
the
*NL*
warm
months
with
her
at
Kellynch
Lodge
,
every
danger
would
be
avoided
;
*NL*
and
it
was
in
fact
,
a
change
which
must
do
both
health
and
spirits
*NL*
good
.
Anne
had
been
too
little
from
home
,
too
little
seen
.
Her
spirits
*NL*
were
not
high
.
A
larger
society
would
improve
them
.
She
wanted
her
to
*NL*
be
more
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
undesirableness
of
any
other
house
in
the
same
neighbourhood
for
*NL*
Sir
Walter
was
certainly
much
strengthened
by
one
part
,
and
a
very
*NL*
material
part
of
the
scheme
,
which
had
been
happily
engrafted
on
the
*NL*
beginning
.
He
was
not
only
to
quit
his
home
,
but
to
see
it
in
the
*NL*
hands
of
others
;
a
trial
of
fortitude
,
which
stronger
heads
than
Sir
*NL*
Walter
's
have
found
too
much
.
Kellynch
Hall
was
to
be
let
.
This
,
*NL*
however
,
was
a
profound
secret
,
not
to
be
breathed
beyond
their
own
*NL*
circle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
could
not
have
borne
the
degradation
of
being
known
to
*NL*
design
letting
his
house
.
Mr
Shepherd
had
once
mentioned
the
word
*NL*
``
advertise
,
''
but
never
dared
approach
it
again
.
Sir
Walter
spurned
the
*NL*
idea
of
its
being
offered
in
any
manner
;
forbad
the
slightest
hint
*NL*
being
dropped
of
his
having
such
an
intention
;
and
it
was
only
on
the
*NL*
supposition
of
his
being
spontaneously
solicited
by
some
most
*NL*
unexceptionable
applicant
,
on
his
own
terms
,
and
as
a
great
favour
,
*NL*
that
he
would
let
it
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
quick
come
the
reasons
for
approving
what
we
like
!
Lady
Russell
*NL*
had
another
excellent
one
at
hand
,
for
being
extremely
glad
that
Sir
*NL*
Walter
and
his
family
were
to
remove
from
the
country
.
Elizabeth
had
*NL*
been
lately
forming
an
intimacy
,
which
she
wished
to
see
interrupted
.
*NL*
It
was
with
the
daughter
of
Mr
Shepherd
,
who
had
returned
,
after
an
*NL*
unprosperous
marriage
,
to
her
father
's
house
,
with
the
additional
*NL*
burden
of
two
children
.
She
was
a
clever
young
woman
,
who
understood
*NL*
the
art
of
pleasing
--
the
art
of
pleasing
,
at
least
,
at
Kellynch
Hall
;
*NL*
and
who
had
made
herself
so
acceptable
to
Miss
Elliot
,
as
to
have
been
*NL*
already
staying
there
more
than
once
,
in
spite
of
all
that
Lady
*NL*
Russell
,
who
thought
it
a
friendship
quite
out
of
place
,
could
hint
of
*NL*
caution
and
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
,
indeed
,
had
scarcely
any
influence
with
Elizabeth
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
love
her
,
rather
because
she
would
love
her
,
than
because
*NL*
Elizabeth
deserved
it
.
She
had
never
received
from
her
more
than
*NL*
outward
attention
,
nothing
beyond
the
observances
of
complaisance
;
had
*NL*
never
succeeded
in
any
point
which
she
wanted
to
carry
,
against
*NL*
previous
inclination
.
She
had
been
repeatedly
very
earnest
in
trying
*NL*
to
get
Anne
included
in
the
visit
to
London
,
sensibly
open
to
all
the
*NL*
injustice
and
all
the
discredit
of
the
selfish
arrangements
which
shut
*NL*
her
out
,
and
on
many
lesser
occasions
had
endeavoured
to
give
Elizabeth
*NL*
the
advantage
of
her
own
better
judgement
and
experience
;
but
always
in
*NL*
vain
:
Elizabeth
would
go
her
own
way
;
and
never
had
she
pursued
it
in
*NL*
more
decided
opposition
to
Lady
Russell
than
in
this
selection
of
Mrs
*NL*
Clay
;
turning
from
the
society
of
so
deserving
a
sister
,
to
bestow
her
*NL*
affection
and
confidence
on
one
who
ought
to
have
been
nothing
to
her
*NL*
but
the
object
of
distant
civility
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
situation
,
Mrs
Clay
was
,
in
Lady
Russell
's
estimate
,
a
very
*NL*
unequal
,
and
in
her
character
she
believed
a
very
dangerous
companion
;
*NL*
and
a
removal
that
would
leave
Mrs
Clay
behind
,
and
bring
a
choice
of
*NL*
more
suitable
intimates
within
Miss
Elliot
's
reach
,
was
therefore
an
*NL*
object
of
first-rate
importance
.

``
I
must
take
leave
to
observe
,
Sir
Walter
,
''
said
Mr
Shepherd
one
*NL*
morning
at
Kellynch
Hall
,
as
he
laid
down
the
newspaper
,
``
that
the
*NL*
present
juncture
is
much
in
our
favour
.
This
peace
will
be
turning
all
*NL*
our
rich
naval
officers
ashore
.
They
will
be
all
wanting
a
home
.
*NL*
Could
not
be
a
better
time
,
Sir
Walter
,
for
having
a
choice
of
tenants
,
*NL*
very
responsible
tenants
.
Many
a
noble
fortune
has
been
made
during
*NL*
the
war
.
If
a
rich
admiral
were
to
come
in
our
way
,
Sir
Walter
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
be
a
very
lucky
man
,
Shepherd
,
''
replied
Sir
Walter
;
``
that
's
*NL*
all
I
have
to
remark
.
A
prize
indeed
would
Kellynch
Hall
be
to
him
;
*NL*
rather
the
greatest
prize
of
all
,
let
him
have
taken
ever
so
many
*NL*
before
;
hey
,
Shepherd
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Shepherd
laughed
,
as
he
knew
he
must
,
at
this
wit
,
and
then
added
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
presume
to
observe
,
Sir
Walter
,
that
,
in
the
way
of
business
,
*NL*
gentlemen
of
the
navy
are
well
to
deal
with
.
I
have
had
a
little
*NL*
knowledge
of
their
methods
of
doing
business
;
and
I
am
free
to
confess
*NL*
that
they
have
very
liberal
notions
,
and
are
as
likely
to
make
*NL*
desirable
tenants
as
any
set
of
people
one
should
meet
with
.
*NL*
Therefore
,
Sir
Walter
,
what
I
would
take
leave
to
suggest
is
,
that
if
*NL*
in
consequence
of
any
rumours
getting
abroad
of
your
intention
;
which
*NL*
must
be
contemplated
as
a
possible
thing
,
because
we
know
how
difficult
*NL*
it
is
to
keep
the
actions
and
designs
of
one
part
of
the
world
from
the
*NL*
notice
and
curiosity
of
the
other
;
consequence
has
its
tax
;
I
,
John
*NL*
Shepherd
,
might
conceal
any
family-matters
that
I
chose
,
for
nobody
*NL*
would
think
it
worth
their
while
to
observe
me
;
but
Sir
Walter
Elliot
*NL*
has
eyes
upon
him
which
it
may
be
very
difficult
to
elude
;
and
*NL*
therefore
,
thus
much
I
venture
upon
,
that
it
will
not
greatly
surprise
*NL*
me
if
,
with
all
our
caution
,
some
rumour
of
the
truth
should
get
*NL*
abroad
;
in
the
supposition
of
which
,
as
I
was
going
to
observe
,
since
*NL*
applications
will
unquestionably
follow
,
I
should
think
any
from
our
*NL*
wealthy
naval
commanders
particularly
worth
attending
to
;
and
beg
leave
*NL*
to
add
,
that
two
hours
will
bring
me
over
at
any
time
,
to
save
you
the
*NL*
trouble
of
replying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
only
nodded
.
But
soon
afterwards
,
rising
and
pacing
the
*NL*
room
,
he
observed
sarcastically
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
few
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
navy
,
I
imagine
,
who
would
*NL*
not
be
surprised
to
find
themselves
in
a
house
of
this
description
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
would
look
around
them
,
no
doubt
,
and
bless
their
good
fortune
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs
Clay
,
for
Mrs
Clay
was
present
:
her
father
had
driven
her
*NL*
over
,
nothing
being
of
so
much
use
to
Mrs
Clay
's
health
as
a
drive
to
*NL*
Kellynch
:
``
but
I
quite
agree
with
my
father
in
thinking
a
sailor
might
*NL*
be
a
very
desirable
tenant
.
I
have
known
a
good
deal
of
the
*NL*
profession
;
and
besides
their
liberality
,
they
are
so
neat
and
careful
*NL*
in
all
their
ways
!
These
valuable
pictures
of
yours
,
Sir
Walter
,
if
*NL*
you
chose
to
leave
them
,
would
be
perfectly
safe
.
Everything
in
and
*NL*
about
the
house
would
be
taken
such
excellent
care
of
!
The
gardens
and
*NL*
shrubberies
would
be
kept
in
almost
as
high
order
as
they
are
now
.
You
*NL*
need
not
be
afraid
,
Miss
Elliot
,
of
your
own
sweet
flower
gardens
being
*NL*
neglected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
all
that
,
''
rejoined
Sir
Walter
coolly
,
``
supposing
I
were
induced
*NL*
to
let
my
house
,
I
have
by
no
means
made
up
my
mind
as
to
the
*NL*
privileges
to
be
annexed
to
it
.
I
am
not
particularly
disposed
to
*NL*
favour
a
tenant
.
The
park
would
be
open
to
him
of
course
,
and
few
navy
*NL*
officers
,
or
men
of
any
other
description
,
can
have
had
such
a
range
;
*NL*
but
what
restrictions
I
might
impose
on
the
use
of
the
*NL*
pleasure-grounds
,
is
another
thing
.
I
am
not
fond
of
the
idea
of
my
*NL*
shrubberies
being
always
approachable
;
and
I
should
recommend
Miss
*NL*
Elliot
to
be
on
her
guard
with
respect
to
her
flower
garden
.
I
am
very
*NL*
little
disposed
to
grant
a
tenant
of
Kellynch
Hall
any
extraordinary
*NL*
favour
,
I
assure
you
,
be
he
sailor
or
soldier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
pause
,
Mr
Shepherd
presumed
to
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
all
these
cases
,
there
are
established
usages
which
make
everything
*NL*
plain
and
easy
between
landlord
and
tenant
.
Your
interest
,
Sir
Walter
,
*NL*
is
in
pretty
safe
hands
.
Depend
upon
me
for
taking
care
that
no
tenant
*NL*
has
more
than
his
just
rights
.
I
venture
to
hint
,
that
Sir
Walter
*NL*
Elliot
can
not
be
half
so
jealous
for
his
own
,
as
John
Shepherd
will
be
*NL*
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Anne
spoke
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
navy
,
I
think
,
who
have
done
so
much
for
us
,
have
at
least
an
*NL*
equal
claim
with
any
other
set
of
men
,
for
all
the
comforts
and
all
the
*NL*
privileges
which
any
home
can
give
.
Sailors
work
hard
enough
for
their
*NL*
comforts
,
we
must
all
allow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
very
true

What
Miss
Anne
says
,
is
very
true

''
was
Mr
*NL*
Shepherd
's
rejoinder
,
and
``
Oh
!
certainly
,
''
was
his
daughter
's
;
but
Sir
*NL*
Walter
's
remark
was
,
soon
afterwards
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
profession
has
its
utility
,
but
I
should
be
sorry
to
see
any
*NL*
friend
of
mine
belonging
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
was
the
reply
,
and
with
a
look
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
is
in
two
points
offensive
to
me
;
I
have
two
strong
grounds
of
*NL*
objection
to
it
.
First
,
as
being
the
means
of
bringing
persons
of
*NL*
obscure
birth
into
undue
distinction
,
and
raising
men
to
honours
which
*NL*
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
never
dreamt
of
;
and
secondly
,
as
it
*NL*
cuts
up
a
man
's
youth
and
vigour
most
horribly
;
a
sailor
grows
old
*NL*
sooner
than
any
other
man
.
I
have
observed
it
all
my
life
.
A
man
is
*NL*
in
greater
danger
in
the
navy
of
being
insulted
by
the
rise
of
one
*NL*
whose
father
,
his
father
might
have
disdained
to
speak
to
,
and
of
*NL*
becoming
prematurely
an
object
of
disgust
himself
,
than
in
any
other
*NL*
line
.
One
day
last
spring
,
in
town
,
I
was
in
company
with
two
men
,
*NL*
striking
instances
of
what
I
am
talking
of
;
Lord
St
Ives
,
whose
father
*NL*
we
all
know
to
have
been
a
country
curate
,
without
bread
to
eat
;
I
was
*NL*
to
give
place
to
Lord
St
Ives
,
and
a
certain
Admiral
Baldwin
,
the
most
*NL*
deplorable-looking
personage
you
can
imagine
;
his
face
the
colour
of
*NL*
mahogany
,
rough
and
rugged
to
the
last
degree
;
all
lines
and
wrinkles
,
*NL*
nine
grey
hairs
of
a
side
,
and
nothing
but
a
dab
of
powder
at
top
.
`
In
*NL*
the
name
of
heaven
,
who
is
that
old
fellow
?
'
said
I
to
a
friend
of
mine
*NL*
who
was
standing
near
,
-LRB-
Sir
Basil
Morley
-RRB-
.
`
Old
fellow
!
'
cried
Sir
*NL*
Basil
,
`
it
is
Admiral
Baldwin
.
What
do
you
take
his
age
to
be
?
'
*NL*
`
Sixty
,
'
said
I
,
`
or
perhaps
sixty-two
.
'
`
Forty
,
'
replied
Sir
Basil
,
*NL*
`
forty
,
and
no
more
.
'
Picture
to
yourselves
my
amazement
;
I
shall
not
*NL*
easily
forget
Admiral
Baldwin
.
I
never
saw
quite
so
wretched
an
*NL*
example
of
what
a
sea-faring
life
can
do
;
but
to
a
degree
,
I
know
it
is
*NL*
the
same
with
them
all
:
they
are
all
knocked
about
,
and
exposed
to
*NL*
every
climate
,
and
every
weather
,
till
they
are
not
fit
to
be
seen
.
It
*NL*
is
a
pity
they
are
not
knocked
on
the
head
at
once
,
before
they
reach
*NL*
Admiral
Baldwin
's
age
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Sir
Walter
,
''
cried
Mrs
Clay
,
``
this
is
being
severe
indeed
.
Have
*NL*
a
little
mercy
on
the
poor
men
.
We
are
not
all
born
to
be
handsome
.
*NL*
The
sea
is
no
beautifier
,
certainly
;
sailors
do
grow
old
betimes
;
I
*NL*
have
observed
it
;
they
soon
lose
the
look
of
youth
.
But
then
,
is
not
*NL*
it
the
same
with
many
other
professions
,
perhaps
most
other
?
Soldiers
,
*NL*
in
active
service
,
are
not
at
all
better
off
:
and
even
in
the
quieter
*NL*
professions
,
there
is
a
toil
and
a
labour
of
the
mind
,
if
not
of
the
*NL*
body
,
which
seldom
leaves
a
man
's
looks
to
the
natural
effect
of
time
.
*NL*
The
lawyer
plods
,
quite
care-worn
;
the
physician
is
up
at
all
hours
,
*NL*
and
travelling
in
all
weather
;
and
even
the
clergyman
--
''
she
stopt
a
*NL*
moment
to
consider
what
might
do
for
the
clergyman
;
--
``
and
even
the
*NL*
clergyman
,
you
know
is
obliged
to
go
into
infected
rooms
,
and
expose
*NL*
his
health
and
looks
to
all
the
injury
of
a
poisonous
atmosphere
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
as
I
have
long
been
convinced
,
though
every
profession
is
*NL*
necessary
and
honourable
in
its
turn
,
it
is
only
the
lot
of
those
who
*NL*
are
not

follow
any

can
live
in
a
regular
way
,
in
the
*NL*
country
,
choosing
their
own
hours
,
following
their
own
pursuits
,
and
*NL*
living
on
their
own
property
,
without
the
torment
of
trying
for
more
;
*NL*
it
is
only
their
lot
,
I
say
,
to
hold
the
blessings
of
health
and
a
good
*NL*
appearance
to
the
utmost
:
I
know
no
other
set
of
men
but
what
lose
*NL*
something
of
their
personableness
when
they
cease
to
be
quite
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
if
Mr
Shepherd
,
in
this
anxiety
to
bespeak
Sir
Walter
's
*NL*
good
will
towards
a
naval
officer
as
tenant
,
had
been
gifted
with
*NL*
foresight
;
for
the
very
first
application
for
the
house
was
from
an
*NL*
Admiral
Croft
,
with
whom
he
shortly
afterwards
fell
into
company
in
*NL*
attending
the
quarter
sessions
at
Taunton
;
and
indeed
,
he
had
received
*NL*
a
hint
of
the
Admiral
from
a
London
correspondent
.
By
the
report
which
*NL*
he
hastened
over
to
Kellynch
to
make
,
Admiral
Croft
was
a
native
of
*NL*
Somersetshire
,
who
having
acquired
a
very
handsome
fortune
,
was
wishing
*NL*
to
settle
in
his
own
country
,
and
had
come
down
to
Taunton
in
order
to
*NL*
look
at
some
advertised
places
in
that
immediate
neighbourhood
,
which
,
*NL*
however
,
had
not
suited
him
;
that
accidentally
hearing
--
-LRB-
it
was
just
as
*NL*
he
had
foretold
,
Mr
Shepherd
observed
,
Sir
Walter
's
concerns
could
not
*NL*
be
kept
a
secret
,
-RRB-
--
accidentally
hearing
of
the
possibility
of
*NL*
Kellynch
Hall
being
to
let
,
and
understanding
his
-LRB-
Mr
Shepherd
's
-RRB-
*NL*
connection
with
the
owner
,
he
had
introduced
himself
to
him
in
order
to
*NL*
make
particular
inquiries
,
and
had
,
in
the
course
of
a
pretty
long
*NL*
conference
,
expressed
as
strong
an
inclination
for
the
place
as
a
man
*NL*
who
knew
it
only
by
description
could
feel
;
and
given
Mr
Shepherd
,
in
*NL*
his
explicit
account
of
himself
,
every
proof
of
his
being
a
most
*NL*
responsible
,
eligible
tenant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
Admiral
Croft
?
''
was
Sir
Walter
's
cold
suspicious
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Shepherd
answered
for
his
being
of
a
gentleman
's
family
,
and
*NL*
mentioned
a
place
;
and
Anne
,
after
the
little
pause
which
followed
,
*NL*
added
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
rear
admiral
of
the
white
.
He
was
in
the
Trafalgar
action
,
*NL*
and
has
been
in
the
East
Indies
since
;
he
was
stationed
there
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
several
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
take
it
for
granted
,
''
observed
Sir
Walter
,
``
that
his
face
is
*NL*
about
as
orange
as
the
cuffs
and
capes
of
my
livery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Shepherd
hastened
to
assure
him
,
that
Admiral
Croft
was
a
very
hale
,
*NL*
hearty
,
well-looking
man
,
a
little
weather-beaten
,
to
be
sure
,
but
not
*NL*
much
,
and
quite
the
gentleman
in
all
his
notions
and
behaviour
;
not
*NL*
likely
to
make
the
smallest
difficulty
about
terms
,
only
wanted
a
*NL*
comfortable
home
,
and
to
get
into
it
as
soon
as
possible
;
knew
he
must
*NL*
pay
for
his
convenience
;
knew
what
rent
a
ready-furnished
house
of
that
*NL*
consequence
might
fetch
;
should
not
have
been
surprised
if
Sir
Walter
*NL*
had
asked
more
;
had
inquired
about
the
manor
;
would
be
glad
of
the
*NL*
deputation
,
certainly
,
but
made
no
great
point
of
it
;
said
he
sometimes
*NL*
took
out
a
gun
,
but
never
killed
;
quite
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Shepherd
was
eloquent
on
the
subject
;
pointing
out
all
the
*NL*
circumstances
of
the
Admiral
's
family
,
which
made
him
peculiarly
*NL*
desirable
as
a
tenant
.
He
was
a
married
man
,
and
without
children
;
the
*NL*
very
state
to
be
wished
for
.
A
house
was
never
taken
good
care
of
,
Mr
*NL*
Shepherd
observed
,
without
a
lady
:
he
did
not
know
,
whether
furniture
*NL*
might
not
be
in
danger
of
suffering
as
much
where
there
was
no
lady
,
as
*NL*
where
there
were
many
children
.
A
lady
,
without
a
family
,
was
the
very
*NL*
best
preserver
of
furniture
in
the
world
.
He
had
seen
Mrs
Croft
,
too
;
*NL*
she
was
at
Taunton
with
the
admiral
,
and
had
been
present
almost
all
*NL*
the
time
they
were
talking
the
matter
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
very
well-spoken
,
genteel
,
shrewd
lady
,
she
seemed
to
be
,
''
*NL*
continued
he
;
``
asked
more
questions
about
the
house
,
and
terms
,
and
*NL*
taxes
,
than
the
Admiral
himself
,
and
seemed
more
conversant
with
*NL*
business
;
and
moreover
,
Sir
Walter
,
I
found
she
was
not
quite
*NL*
unconnected
in
this
country
,
any
more
than
her
husband
;
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
she
is
sister
to
a
gentleman
who
did
live
amongst
us
once
;
she
told
me
*NL*
so
herself
:
sister
to
the
gentleman
who
lived
a
few
years
back
at
*NL*
Monkford
.
Bless
me
!
what
was
his
name
?
At
this
moment
I
can
not
*NL*
recollect
his
name
,
though
I
have
heard
it
so
lately
.
Penelope
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
can
you
help
me
to
the
name
of
the
gentleman
who
lived
at
*NL*
Monkford
:
Mrs
Croft
's
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs
Clay
was
talking
so
eagerly
with
Miss
Elliot
,
that
she
did
not
*NL*
hear
the
appeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
conception
whom
you
can
mean
,
Shepherd
;
I
remember
no
*NL*
gentleman
resident
at
Monkford
since
the
time
of
old
Governor
Trent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
me
!
how
very
odd
!
I
shall
forget
my
own
name
soon
,
I
suppose
.
*NL*
A
name
that
I
am
so
very
well
acquainted
with
;
knew
the
gentleman
so
*NL*
well
by
sight
;
seen
him
a
hundred
times
;
came
to
consult
me
once
,
I
*NL*
remember
,
about
a
trespass
of
one
of
his
neighbours
;
farmer
's
man
*NL*
breaking
into
his
orchard
;
wall
torn
down
;
apples
stolen
;
caught
in
the
*NL*
fact
;
and
afterwards
,
contrary
to
my
judgement
,
submitted
to
an
*NL*
amicable
compromise
.
Very
odd
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
waiting
another
moment
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
Mr
Wentworth
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Shepherd
was
all
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wentworth
was
the
very
name
!
Mr
Wentworth
was
the
very
man
.
He
had
*NL*
the
curacy
of
Monkford
,
you
know
,
Sir
Walter
,
some
time
back
,
for
two
*NL*
or
three
years
.
Came
there
about
the
year
--
5
,
I
take
it
.
You
*NL*
remember
him
,
I
am
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wentworth
?
Oh
!
ay
,
--
Mr
Wentworth
,
the
curate
of
Monkford
.
You
misled
*NL*
me
by
the
term
gentleman
.
I
thought
you
were
speaking
of
some
man
of
*NL*
property
:
Mr
Wentworth
was
nobody
,
I
remember
;
quite
unconnected
;
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
the
Strafford
family
.
One
wonders
how
the
names
of
*NL*
many
of
our
nobility
become
so
common
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr
Shepherd
perceived
that
this
connexion
of
the
Crofts
did
them
no
*NL*
service
with
Sir
Walter
,
he
mentioned
it
no
more
;
returning
,
with
all
*NL*
his
zeal
,
to
dwell
on
the
circumstances
more
indisputably
in
their
*NL*
favour
;
their
age
,
and
number
,
and
fortune
;
the
high
idea
they
had
*NL*
formed
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
and
extreme
solicitude
for
the
advantage
of
*NL*
renting
it
;
making
it
appear
as
if
they
ranked
nothing
beyond
the
*NL*
happiness
of
being
the
tenants
of
Sir
Walter
Elliot
:
an
extraordinary
*NL*
taste
,
certainly
,
could
they
have
been
supposed
in
the
secret
of
Sir
*NL*
Walter
's
estimate
of
the
dues
of
a
tenant
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
succeeded
,
however
;
and
though
Sir
Walter
must
ever
look
with
an
*NL*
evil
eye
on
anyone
intending
to
inhabit
that
house
,
and
think
them
*NL*
infinitely
too
well
off
in
being
permitted
to
rent
it
on
the
highest
*NL*
terms
,
he
was
talked
into
allowing
Mr
Shepherd
to
proceed
in
the
*NL*
treaty
,
and
authorising
him
to
wait
on
Admiral
Croft
,
who
still
*NL*
remained
at
Taunton
,
and
fix
a
day
for
the
house
being
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
was
not
very
wise
;
but
still
he
had
experience
enough
of
the
*NL*
world
to
feel
,
that
a
more
unobjectionable
tenant
,
in
all
essentials
,
*NL*
than
Admiral
Croft
bid
fair
to
be
,
could
hardly
offer
.
So
far
went
his
*NL*
understanding
;
and
his
vanity
supplied
a
little
additional
soothing
,
in
*NL*
the
Admiral
's
situation
in
life
,
which
was
just
high
enough
,
and
not
*NL*
too
high
.
``
I
have
let
my
house
to
Admiral
Croft
,
''
would
sound
*NL*
extremely
well
;
very
much
better
than
to
any
mere
Mr
--
;
a
Mr
-LRB-
save
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
some
half
dozen
in
the
nation
,
-RRB-
always
needs
a
note
of
*NL*
explanation
.
An
admiral
speaks
his
own
consequence
,
and
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
can
never
make
a
baronet
look
small
.
In
all
their
dealings
and
*NL*
intercourse
,
Sir
Walter
Elliot
must
ever
have
the
precedence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
done
without
a
reference
to
Elizabeth
:
but
her
*NL*
inclination
was
growing
so
strong
for
a
removal
,
that
she
was
happy
to
*NL*
have
it
fixed
and
expedited
by
a
tenant
at
hand
;
and
not
a
word
to
*NL*
suspend
decision
was
uttered
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Shepherd
was
completely
empowered
to
act
;
and
no
sooner
had
such
an
*NL*
end
been
reached
,
than
Anne
,
who
had
been
a
most
attentive
listener
to
*NL*
the
whole
,
left
the
room
,
to
seek
the
comfort
of
cool
air
for
her
*NL*
flushed
cheeks
;
and
as
she
walked
along
a
favourite
grove
,
said
,
with
a
*NL*
gentle
sigh
,
``
A
few
months
more
,
and
he
,
perhaps
,
may
be
walking
here

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
Mr
Wentworth
,
the
former
curate
of
Monkford
,
however
*NL*
suspicious
appearances
may
be
,
but
a
Captain
Frederick
Wentworth
,
his
*NL*
brother
,
who
being
made
commander
in
consequence
of
the
action
off
St
*NL*
Domingo
,
and
not
immediately
employed
,
had
come
into
Somersetshire
,
in
*NL*
the
summer
of
1806
;
and
having
no
parent
living
,
found
a
home
for
half
*NL*
a
year
at
Monkford
.
He
was
,
at
that
time
,
a
remarkably
fine
young
man
,
*NL*
with
a
great
deal
of
intelligence
,
spirit
,
and
brilliancy
;
and
Anne
an
*NL*
extremely
pretty
girl
,
with
gentleness
,
modesty
,
taste
,
and
feeling
.
*NL*
Half
the
sum
of
attraction
,
on
either
side
,
might
have
been
enough
,
for
*NL*
he
had
nothing
to
do
,
and
she
had
hardly
anybody
to
love
;
but
the
*NL*
encounter
of
such
lavish
recommendations
could
not
fail
.
They
were
*NL*
gradually
acquainted
,
and
when
acquainted
,
rapidly
and
deeply
in
love
.
*NL*
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
had
seen
highest
perfection
in
the
*NL*
other
,
or
which
had
been
the
happiest
:
she
,
in
receiving
his
*NL*
declarations
and
proposals
,
or
he
in
having
them
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
period
of
exquisite
felicity
followed
,
and
but
a
short
one
.
*NL*
Troubles
soon
arose
.
Sir
Walter
,
on
being
applied
to
,
without
actually
*NL*
withholding
his
consent
,
or
saying
it
should
never
be
,
gave
it
all
the
*NL*
negative
of
great
astonishment
,
great
coldness
,
great
silence
,
and
a
*NL*
professed
resolution
of
doing
nothing
for
his
daughter
.
He
thought
it
*NL*
a
very
degrading
alliance
;
and
Lady
Russell
,
though
with
more
tempered
*NL*
and
pardonable
pride
,
received
it
as
a
most
unfortunate
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
Elliot
,
with
all
her
claims
of
birth
,
beauty
,
and
mind
,
to
throw
*NL*
herself
away
at
nineteen
;
involve
herself
at
nineteen
in
an
engagement
*NL*
with
a
young
man
,
who
had
nothing
but
himself
to
recommend
him
,
and
no
*NL*
hopes
of
attaining
affluence
,
but
in
the
chances
of
a
most
uncertain
*NL*
profession
,
and
no
connexions
to
secure
even
his
farther
rise
in
the
*NL*
profession
,
would
be
,
indeed
,
a
throwing
away
,
which
she
grieved
to
*NL*
think
of
!
Anne
Elliot
,
so
young
;
known
to
so
few
,
to
be
snatched
off
*NL*
by
a
stranger
without
alliance
or
fortune
;
or
rather
sunk
by
him
into
a
*NL*
state
of
most
wearing
,
anxious
,
youth-killing
dependence
!
It
must
not
*NL*
be
,
if
by
any
fair
interference
of
friendship
,
any
representations
from
*NL*
one
who
had
almost
a
mother
's
love
,
and
mother
's
rights
,
it
would
be
*NL*
prevented
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
had
no
fortune
.
He
had
been
lucky
in
his
profession
;
*NL*
but
spending
freely
,
what
had
come
freely
,
had
realized
nothing
.
But
*NL*
he
was
confident
that
he
should
soon
be
rich
:
full
of
life
and
ardour
,
*NL*
he
knew
that
he
should
soon
have
a
ship
,
and
soon
be
on
a
station
that
*NL*
would
lead
to
everything
he
wanted
.
He
had
always
been
lucky
;
he
knew
*NL*
he
should
be
so
still
.
Such
confidence
,
powerful
in
its
own
warmth
,
*NL*
and
bewitching
in
the
wit
which
often
expressed
it
,
must
have
been
*NL*
enough
for
Anne
;
but
Lady
Russell
saw
it
very
differently
.
His
*NL*
sanguine
temper
,
and
fearlessness
of
mind
,
operated
very
differently
on
*NL*
her
.
She
saw
in
it
but
an
aggravation
of
the
evil
.
It
only
added
a
*NL*
dangerous
character
to
himself
.
He
was
brilliant
,
he
was
headstrong
.
*NL*
Lady
Russell
had
little
taste
for
wit
,
and
of
anything
approaching
to
*NL*
imprudence
a
horror
.
She
deprecated
the
connexion
in
every
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
opposition
,
as
these
feelings
produced
,
was
more
than
Anne
could
*NL*
combat
.
Young
and
gentle
as
she
was
,
it
might
yet
have
been
possible
*NL*
to
withstand
her
father
's
ill-will
,
though
unsoftened
by
one
kind
word
*NL*
or
look
on
the
part
of
her
sister
;
but
Lady
Russell
,
whom
she
had
*NL*
always
loved
and
relied
on
,
could
not
,
with
such
steadiness
of
opinion
,
*NL*
and
such
tenderness
of
manner
,
be
continually
advising
her
in
vain
.
*NL*
She
was
persuaded
to
believe
the
engagement
a
wrong
thing
:
indiscreet
,
*NL*
improper
,
hardly
capable
of
success
,
and
not
deserving
it
.
But
it
was
*NL*
not
a
merely
selfish
caution
,
under
which
she
acted
,
in
putting
an
end
*NL*
to
it
.
Had
she
not
imagined
herself
consulting
his
good
,
even
more
*NL*
than
her
own
,
she
could
hardly
have
given
him
up
.
The
belief
of
being
*NL*
prudent
,
and
self-denying
,
principally
for
his
advantage
,
was
her
chief
*NL*
consolation
,
under
the
misery
of
a
parting
,
a
final
parting
;
and
every
*NL*
consolation
was
required
,
for
she
had
to
encounter
all
the
additional
*NL*
pain
of
opinions
,
on
his
side
,
totally
unconvinced
and
unbending
,
and
*NL*
of
his
feeling
himself
ill
used
by
so
forced
a
relinquishment
.
He
had
*NL*
left
the
country
in
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
months
had
seen
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
their
acquaintance
;
*NL*
but
not
with
a
few
months
ended
Anne
's
share
of
suffering
from
it
.
Her
*NL*
attachment
and
regrets
had
,
for
a
long
time
,
clouded
every
enjoyment
of
*NL*
youth
,
and
an
early
loss
of
bloom
and
spirits
had
been
their
lasting
*NL*
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
seven
years
were
gone
since
this
little
history
of
sorrowful
*NL*
interest
had
reached
its
close
;
and
time
had
softened
down
much
,
*NL*
perhaps
nearly
all
of
peculiar
attachment
to
him
,
but
she
had
been
too
*NL*
dependent
on
time
alone
;
no
aid
had
been
given
in
change
of
place
*NL*
-LRB-
except
in
one
visit
to
Bath
soon
after
the
rupture
-RRB-
,
or
in
any
novelty
*NL*
or
enlargement
of
society
.
No
one
had
ever
come
within
the
Kellynch
*NL*
circle
,
who
could
bear
a
comparison
with
Frederick
Wentworth
,
as
he
*NL*
stood
in
her
memory
.
No
second
attachment
,
the
only
thoroughly
*NL*
natural
,
happy
,
and
sufficient
cure
,
at
her
time
of
life
,
had
been
*NL*
possible
to
the
nice
tone
of
her
mind
,
the
fastidiousness
of
her
taste
,
*NL*
in
the
small
limits
of
the
society
around
them
.
She
had
been
*NL*
solicited
,
when
about
two-and-twenty
,
to
change
her
name
,
by
the
young
*NL*
man
,
who
not
long
afterwards
found
a
more
willing
mind
in
her
younger
*NL*
sister
;
and
Lady
Russell
had
lamented
her
refusal
;
for
Charles
Musgrove
*NL*
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
man
,
whose
landed
property
and
general
*NL*
importance
were
second
in
that
country
,
only
to
Sir
Walter
's
,
and
of
*NL*
good
character
and
appearance
;
and
however
Lady
Russell
might
have
*NL*
asked
yet
for
something
more
,
while
Anne
was
nineteen
,
she
would
have
*NL*
rejoiced
to
see
her
at
twenty-two
so
respectably
removed
from
the
*NL*
partialities
and
injustice
of
her
father
's
house
,
and
settled
so
*NL*
permanently
near
herself
.
But
in
this
case
,
Anne
had
left
nothing
for
*NL*
advice
to
do
;
and
though
Lady
Russell
,
as
satisfied
as
ever
with
her
*NL*
own
discretion
,
never
wished
the
past
undone
,
she
began
now
to
have
the
*NL*
anxiety
which
borders
on
hopelessness
for
Anne
's
being
tempted
,
by
some
*NL*
man
of
talents
and
independence
,
to
enter
a
state
for
which
she
held
*NL*
her
to
be
peculiarly
fitted
by
her
warm
affections
and
domestic
habits
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
knew
not
each
other
's
opinion
,
either
its
constancy
or
its
change
,
*NL*
on
the
one
leading
point
of
Anne
's
conduct
,
for
the
subject
was
never
*NL*
alluded
to
;
but
Anne
,
at
seven-and-twenty
,
thought
very
differently
*NL*
from
what
she
had
been
made
to
think
at
nineteen
.
She
did
not
blame
*NL*
Lady
Russell
,
she
did
not
blame
herself
for
having
been
guided
by
her
;
*NL*
but
she
felt
that
were
any
young
person
,
in
similar
circumstances
,
to
*NL*
apply
to
her
for
counsel
,
they
would
never
receive
any
of
such
certain
*NL*
immediate
wretchedness
,
such
uncertain
future
good
.
She
was
persuaded
*NL*
that
under
every
disadvantage
of
disapprobation
at
home
,
and
every
*NL*
anxiety
attending
his
profession
,
all
their
probable
fears
,
delays
,
and
*NL*
disappointments
,
she
should
yet
have
been
a
happier
woman
in
*NL*
maintaining
the
engagement
,
than
she
had
been
in
the
sacrifice
of
it
;
*NL*
and
this
,
she
fully
believed
,
had
the
usual
share
,
had
even
more
than
*NL*
the
usual
share
of
all
such
solicitudes
and
suspense
been
theirs
,
*NL*
without
reference
to
the
actual
results
of
their
case
,
which
,
as
it
*NL*
happened
,
would
have
bestowed
earlier
prosperity
than
could
be
*NL*
reasonably
calculated
on
.
All
his
sanguine
expectations
,
all
his
*NL*
confidence
had
been
justified
.
His
genius
and
ardour
had
seemed
to
*NL*
foresee
and
to
command
his
prosperous
path
.
He
had
,
very
soon
after
*NL*
their
engagement
ceased
,
got
employ
:
and
all
that
he
had
told
her
would
*NL*
follow
,
had
taken
place
.
He
had
distinguished
himself
,
and
early
*NL*
gained
the
other
step
in
rank
,
and
must
now
,
by
successive
captures
,
*NL*
have
made
a
handsome
fortune
.
She
had
only
navy
lists
and
newspapers
*NL*
for
her
authority
,
but
she
could
not
doubt
his
being
rich
;
and
,
in
*NL*
favour
of
his
constancy
,
she
had
no
reason
to
believe
him
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
eloquent
could
Anne
Elliot
have
been
!
how
eloquent
,
at
least
,
were
*NL*
her
wishes
on
the
side
of
early
warm
attachment
,
and
a
cheerful
*NL*
confidence
in
futurity
,
against
that
over-anxious
caution
which
seems
*NL*
to
insult
exertion
and
distrust
Providence
!
She
had
been
forced
into
*NL*
prudence
in
her
youth
,
she
learned
romance
as
she
grew
older
:
the
*NL*
natural
sequel
of
an
unnatural
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
all
these
circumstances
,
recollections
and
feelings
,
she
could
not
*NL*
hear
that
Captain
Wentworth
's
sister
was
likely
to
live
at
Kellynch
*NL*
without
a
revival
of
former
pain
;
and
many
a
stroll
,
and
many
a
sigh
,
*NL*
were
necessary
to
dispel
the
agitation
of
the
idea
.
She
often
told
*NL*
herself
it
was
folly
,
before
she
could
harden
her
nerves
sufficiently
*NL*
to
feel
the
continual
discussion
of
the
Crofts
and
their
business
no
*NL*
evil
.
She
was
assisted
,
however
,
by
that
perfect
indifference
and
*NL*
apparent
unconsciousness
,
among
the
only
three
of
her
own
friends
in
*NL*
the
secret
of
the
past
,
which
seemed
almost
to
deny
any
recollection
of
*NL*
it
.
She
could
do
justice
to
the
superiority
of
Lady
Russell
's
motives
*NL*
in
this
,
over
those
of
her
father
and
Elizabeth
;
she
could
honour
all
*NL*
the
better
feelings
of
her
calmness
;
but
the
general
air
of
oblivion
*NL*
among
them
was
highly
important
from
whatever
it
sprung
;
and
in
the
*NL*
event
of
Admiral
Croft
's
really
taking
Kellynch
Hall
,
she
rejoiced
anew
*NL*
over
the
conviction
which
had
always
been
most
grateful
to
her
,
of
the
*NL*
past
being
known
to
those
three
only
among
her
connexions
,
by
whom
no
*NL*
syllable
,
she
believed
,
would
ever
be
whispered
,
and
in
the
trust
that
*NL*
among
his
,
the
brother
only
with
whom
he
had
been
residing
,
had
*NL*
received
any
information
of
their
short-lived
engagement
.
That
brother
*NL*
had
been
long
removed
from
the
country
and
being
a
sensible
man
,
and
,
*NL*
moreover
,
a
single
man
at
the
time
,
she
had
a
fond
dependence
on
no
*NL*
human
creature
's
having
heard
of
it
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sister
,
Mrs
Croft
,
had
then
been
out
of
England
,
accompanying
her
*NL*
husband
on
a
foreign
station
,
and
her
own
sister
,
Mary
,
had
been
at
*NL*
school
while
it
all
occurred
;
and
never
admitted
by
the
pride
of
some
,
*NL*
and
the
delicacy
of
others
,
to
the
smallest
knowledge
of
it
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
supports
,
she
hoped
that
the
acquaintance
between
herself
*NL*
and
the
Crofts
,
which
,
with
Lady
Russell
,
still
resident
in
Kellynch
,
*NL*
and
Mary
fixed
only
three
miles
off
,
must
be
anticipated
,
need
not
*NL*
involve
any
particular
awkwardness
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
appointed
for
Admiral
and
Mrs
Croft
's
seeing
Kellynch
*NL*
Hall
,
Anne
found
it
most
natural
to
take
her
almost
daily
walk
to
Lady
*NL*
Russell
's
,
and
keep
out
of
the
way
till
all
was
over
;
when
she
found
it
*NL*
most
natural
to
be
sorry
that
she
had
missed
the
opportunity
of
seeing
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
meeting
of
the
two
parties
proved
highly
satisfactory
,
and
decided
*NL*
the
whole
business
at
once
.
Each
lady
was
previously
well
disposed
for
*NL*
an
agreement
,
and
saw
nothing
,
therefore
,
but
good
manners
in
the
*NL*
other
;
and
with
regard
to
the
gentlemen
,
there
was
such
an
hearty
good
*NL*
humour
,
such
an
open
,
trusting
liberality
on
the
Admiral
's
side
,
as
*NL*
could
not
but
influence
Sir
Walter
,
who
had
besides
been
flattered
into
*NL*
his
very
best
and
most
polished
behaviour
by
Mr
Shepherd
's
assurances
*NL*
of
his
being
known
,
by
report
,
to
the
Admiral
,
as
a
model
of
good
*NL*
breeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
and
grounds
,
and
furniture
,
were
approved
,
the
Crofts
were
*NL*
approved
,
terms
,
time
,
every
thing
,
and
every
body
,
was
right
;
and
Mr
*NL*
Shepherd
's
clerks
were
set
to
work
,
without
there
having
been
a
single
*NL*
preliminary
difference
to
modify
of
all
that
``
This
indenture
sheweth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
,
without
hesitation
,
declared
the
Admiral
to
be
the
*NL*
best-looking
sailor
he
had
ever
met
with
,
and
went
so
far
as
to
say
,
*NL*
that
if
his
own
man
might
have
had
the
arranging
of
his
hair
,
he
should
*NL*
not
be
ashamed
of
being
seen
with
him
any
where
;
and
the
Admiral
,
with
*NL*
sympathetic
cordiality
,
observed
to
his
wife
as
they
drove
back
through
*NL*
the
park
,
``
I
thought
we
should
soon
come
to
a
deal
,
my
dear
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
what
they
told
us
at
Taunton
.
The
Baronet
will
never
set
the
Thames
*NL*
on
fire
,
but
there
seems
to
be
no
harm
in
him
.
''
--
reciprocal
*NL*
compliments
,
which
would
have
been
esteemed
about
equal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Crofts
were
to
have
possession
at
Michaelmas
;
and
as
Sir
Walter
*NL*
proposed
removing
to
Bath
in
the
course
of
the
preceding
month
,
there
*NL*
was
no
time
to
be
lost
in
making
every
dependent
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
,
convinced
that
Anne
would
not
be
allowed
to
be
of
any
*NL*
use
,
or
any
importance
,
in
the
choice
of
the
house
which
they
were
*NL*
going
to
secure
,
was
very
unwilling
to
have
her
hurried
away
so
soon
,
*NL*
and
wanted
to
make
it
possible
for
her
to
stay
behind
till
she
might
*NL*
convey
her
to
Bath
herself
after
Christmas
;
but
having
engagements
of
*NL*
her
own
which
must
take
her
from
Kellynch
for
several
weeks
,
she
was
*NL*
unable
to
give
the
full
invitation
she
wished
,
and
Anne
though
dreading
*NL*
the
possible
heats
of
September
in
all
the
white
glare
of
Bath
,
and
*NL*
grieving
to
forego
all
the
influence
so
sweet
and
so
sad
of
the
*NL*
autumnal
months
in
the
country
,
did
not
think
that
,
everything
*NL*
considered
,
she
wished
to
remain
.
It
would
be
most
right
,
and
most
*NL*
wise
,
and
,
therefore
must
involve
least
suffering
to
go
with
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
occurred
,
however
,
to
give
her
a
different
duty
.
Mary
,
often
*NL*
a
little
unwell
,
and
always
thinking
a
great
deal
of
her
own
*NL*
complaints
,
and
always
in
the
habit
of
claiming
Anne
when
anything
was
*NL*
the
matter
,
was
indisposed
;
and
foreseeing
that
she
should
not
have
a
*NL*
day
's
health
all
the
autumn
,
entreated
,
or
rather
required
her
,
for
it
*NL*
was
hardly
entreaty
,
to
come
to
Uppercross
Cottage
,
and
bear
her
*NL*
company
as
long
as
she
should
want
her
,
instead
of
going
to
Bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
possibly
do
without
Anne
,
''
was
Mary
's
reasoning
;
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
reply
was
,
``
Then
I
am
sure
Anne
had
better
stay
,
for
nobody
*NL*
will
want
her
in
Bath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
claimed
as
a
good
,
though
in
an
improper
style
,
is
at
least
*NL*
better
than
being
rejected
as
no
good
at
all
;
and
Anne
,
glad
to
be
*NL*
thought
of
some
use
,
glad
to
have
anything
marked
out
as
a
duty
,
and
*NL*
certainly
not
sorry
to
have
the
scene
of
it
in
the
country
,
and
her
own
*NL*
dear
country
,
readily
agreed
to
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
invitation
of
Mary
's
removed
all
Lady
Russell
's
difficulties
,
and
*NL*
it
was
consequently
soon
settled
that
Anne
should
not
go
to
Bath
till
*NL*
Lady
Russell
took
her
,
and
that
all
the
intervening
time
should
be
*NL*
divided
between
Uppercross
Cottage
and
Kellynch
Lodge
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
all
was
perfectly
right
;
but
Lady
Russell
was
almost
startled
by
*NL*
the
wrong
of
one
part
of
the
Kellynch
Hall
plan
,
when
it
burst
on
her
,
*NL*
which
was
,
Mrs
Clay
's
being
engaged
to
go
to
Bath
with
Sir
Walter
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
as
a
most
important
and
valuable
assistant
to
the
latter
in
*NL*
all
the
business
before
her
.
Lady
Russell
was
extremely
sorry
that
*NL*
such
a
measure
should
have
been
resorted
to
at
all
,
wondered
,
grieved
,
*NL*
and
feared
;
and
the
affront
it
contained
to
Anne
,
in
Mrs
Clay
's
being
*NL*
of
so
much
use
,
while
Anne
could
be
of
none
,
was
a
very
sore
*NL*
aggravation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
herself
was
become
hardened
to
such
affronts
;
but
she
felt
the
*NL*
imprudence
of
the
arrangement
quite
as
keenly
as
Lady
Russell
.
With
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
quiet
observation
,
and
a
knowledge
,
which
she
often
*NL*
wished
less
,
of
her
father
's
character
,
she
was
sensible
that
results
*NL*
the
most
serious
to
his
family
from
the
intimacy
were
more
than
*NL*
possible
.
She
did
not
imagine
that
her
father
had
at
present
an
idea
*NL*
of
the
kind
.
Mrs
Clay
had
freckles
,
and
a
projecting
tooth
,
and
a
*NL*
clumsy
wrist
,
which
he
was
continually
making
severe
remarks
upon
,
in
*NL*
her
absence
;
but
she
was
young
,
and
certainly
altogether
well-looking
,
*NL*
and
possessed
,
in
an
acute
mind
and
assiduous
pleasing
manners
,
*NL*
infinitely
more
dangerous
attractions
than
any
merely
personal
might
*NL*
have
been
.
Anne
was
so
impressed
by
the
degree
of
their
danger
,
that
*NL*
she
could
not
excuse
herself
from
trying
to
make
it
perceptible
to
her
*NL*
sister
.
She
had
little
hope
of
success
;
but
Elizabeth
,
who
in
the
*NL*
event
of
such
a
reverse
would
be
so
much
more
to
be
pitied
than
*NL*
herself
,
should
never
,
she
thought
,
have
reason
to
reproach
her
for
*NL*
giving
no
warning
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
,
and
seemed
only
to
offend
.
Elizabeth
could
not
conceive
how
*NL*
such
an
absurd
suspicion
should
occur
to
her
,
and
indignantly
answered
*NL*
for
each
party
's
perfectly
knowing
their
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs
Clay
,
''
said
she
,
warmly
,
``
never
forgets
who
she
is
;
and
as
I
am
*NL*
rather
better
acquainted
with
her
sentiments
than
you
can
be
,
I
can
*NL*
assure
you
,
that
upon
the
subject
of
marriage
they
are
particularly
*NL*
nice
,
and
that
she
reprobates
all
inequality
of
condition
and
rank
more
*NL*
strongly
than
most
people
.
And
as
to
my
father
,
I
really
should
not
*NL*
have
thought
that
he
,
who
has
kept
himself
single
so
long
for
our
*NL*
sakes
,
need
be
suspected
now
.
If
Mrs
Clay
were
a
very
beautiful
woman
,
*NL*
I
grant
you
,
it
might
be
wrong
to
have
her
so
much
with
me
;
not
that
*NL*
anything
in
the
world
,
I
am
sure
,
would
induce
my
father
to
make
a
*NL*
degrading
match
,
but
he
might
be
rendered
unhappy
.
But
poor
Mrs
Clay
*NL*
who
,
with
all
her
merits
,
can
never
have
been
reckoned
tolerably
*NL*
pretty
,
I
really
think
poor
Mrs
Clay
may
be
staying
here
in
perfect
*NL*
safety
.
One
would
imagine
you
had
never
heard
my
father
speak
of
her
*NL*
personal
misfortunes
,
though
I
know
you
must
fifty
times
.
That
tooth
*NL*
of
her
's
and
those
freckles
.
Freckles
do
not
disgust
me
so
very
much
*NL*
as
they
do
him
.
I
have
known
a
face
not
materially
disfigured
by
a
*NL*
few
,
but
he
abominates
them
.
You
must
have
heard
him
notice
Mrs
Clay
's
*NL*
freckles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
hardly
any
personal
defect
,
''
replied
Anne
,
``
which
an
*NL*
agreeable
manner
might
not
gradually
reconcile
one
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
very
differently
,
''
answered
Elizabeth
,
shortly
;
``
an
agreeable
*NL*
manner
may
set
off
handsome
features
,
but
can
never
alter
plain
ones
.
*NL*
However
,
at
any
rate
,
as
I
have
a
great
deal
more
at
stake
on
this
*NL*
point
than
anybody
else
can
have
,
I
think
it
rather
unnecessary
in
you
*NL*
to
be
advising
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
done
;
glad
that
it
was
over
,
and
not
absolutely
hopeless
of
*NL*
doing
good
.
Elizabeth
,
though
resenting
the
suspicion
,
might
yet
be
*NL*
made
observant
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
office
of
the
four
carriage-horses
was
to
draw
Sir
Walter
,
*NL*
Miss
Elliot
,
and
Mrs
Clay
to
Bath
.
The
party
drove
off
in
very
good
*NL*
spirits
;
Sir
Walter
prepared
with
condescending
bows
for
all
the
*NL*
afflicted
tenantry
and
cottagers
who
might
have
had
a
hint
to
show
*NL*
themselves
,
and
Anne
walked
up
at
the
same
time
,
in
a
sort
of
desolate
*NL*
tranquillity
,
to
the
Lodge
,
where
she
was
to
spend
the
first
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
friend
was
not
in
better
spirits
than
herself
.
Lady
Russell
felt
*NL*
this
break-up
of
the
family
exceedingly
.
Their
respectability
was
as
*NL*
dear
to
her
as
her
own
,
and
a
daily
intercourse
had
become
precious
by
*NL*
habit
.
It
was
painful
to
look
upon
their
deserted
grounds
,
and
still
*NL*
worse
to
anticipate
the
new
hands
they
were
to
fall
into
;
and
to
escape
*NL*
the
solitariness
and
the
melancholy
of
so
altered
a
village
,
and
be
out
*NL*
of
the
way
when
Admiral
and
Mrs
Croft
first
arrived
,
she
had
determined
*NL*
to
make
her
own
absence
from
home
begin
when
she
must
give
up
Anne
.
*NL*
Accordingly
their
removal
was
made
together
,
and
Anne
was
set
down
at
*NL*
Uppercross
Cottage
,
in
the
first
stage
of
Lady
Russell
's
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uppercross
was
a
moderate-sized
village
,
which
a
few
years
back
had
*NL*
been
completely
in
the
old
English
style
,
containing
only
two
houses
*NL*
superior
in
appearance
to
those
of
the
yeomen
and
labourers
;
the
*NL*
mansion
of
the
squire
,
with
its
high
walls
,
great
gates
,
and
old
trees
,
*NL*
substantial
and
unmodernized
,
and
the
compact
,
tight
parsonage
,
*NL*
enclosed
in
its
own
neat
garden
,
with
a
vine
and
a
pear-tree
trained
*NL*
round
its
casements
;
but
upon
the
marriage
of
the
young
`
squire
,
it
had
*NL*
received
the
improvement
of
a
farm-house
elevated
into
a
cottage
,
for
*NL*
his
residence
,
and
Uppercross
Cottage
,
with
its
veranda
,
French
*NL*
windows
,
and
other
prettiness
,
was
quite
as
likely
to
catch
the
*NL*
traveller
's
eye
as
the
more
consistent
and
considerable
aspect
and
*NL*
premises
of
the
Great
House
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Anne
had
often
been
staying
.
She
knew
the
ways
of
Uppercross
as
*NL*
well
as
those
of
Kellynch
.
The
two
families
were
so
continually
*NL*
meeting
,
so
much
in
the
habit
of
running
in
and
out
of
each
other
's
*NL*
house
at
all
hours
,
that
it
was
rather
a
surprise
to
her
to
find
Mary
*NL*
alone
;
but
being
alone
,
her
being
unwell
and
out
of
spirits
was
almost
*NL*
a
matter
of
course
.
Though
better
endowed
than
the
elder
sister
,
Mary
*NL*
had
not
Anne
's
understanding
nor
temper
.
While
well
,
and
happy
,
and
*NL*
properly
attended
to
,
she
had
great
good
humour
and
excellent
spirits
;
*NL*
but
any
indisposition
sunk
her
completely
.
She
had
no
resources
for
*NL*
solitude
;
and
inheriting
a
considerable
share
of
the
Elliot
*NL*
self-importance
,
was
very
prone
to
add
to
every
other
distress
that
of
*NL*
fancying
herself
neglected
and
ill-used
.
In
person
,
she
was
inferior
to
*NL*
both
sisters
,
and
had
,
even
in
her
bloom
,
only
reached
the
dignity
of
*NL*
being
``
a
fine
girl
.
''
She
was
now
lying
on
the
faded
sofa
of
the
pretty
*NL*
little
drawing-room
,
the
once
elegant
furniture
of
which
had
been
*NL*
gradually
growing
shabby
,
under
the
influence
of
four
summers
and
two
*NL*
children
;
and
,
on
Anne
's
appearing
,
greeted
her
with
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
you
are
come
at
last
!
I
began
to
think
I
should
never
see
you
.
I
*NL*
am
so
ill
I
can
hardly
speak
.
I
have
not
seen
a
creature
the
whole
*NL*
morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
find
you
unwell
,
''
replied
Anne
.
``
You
sent
me
such
a
*NL*
good
account
of
yourself
on
Thursday
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
made
the
best
of
it
;
I
always
do
:
but
I
was
very
far
from
well
*NL*
at
the
time
;
and
I
do
not
think
I
ever
was
so
ill
in
my
life
as
I
have
*NL*
been
all
this
morning
:
very
unfit
to
be
left
alone
,
I
am
sure
.
*NL*
Suppose
I
were
to
be
seized
of
a
sudden
in
some
dreadful
way
,
and
not
*NL*
able
to
ring
the
bell
!
So
,
Lady
Russell
would
not
get
out
.
I
do
not
*NL*
think
she
has
been
in
this
house
three
times
this
summer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
said
what
was
proper
,
and
enquired
after
her
husband
.
``
Oh
!
*NL*
Charles
is
out
shooting
.
I
have
not
seen
him
since
seven
o'clock
.
He
*NL*
would
go
,
though
I
told
him
how
ill
I
was
.
He
said
he
should
not
stay
*NL*
out
long
;
but
he
has
never
come
back
,
and
now
it
is
almost
one
.
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
I
have
not
seen
a
soul
this
whole
long
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
had
your
little
boys
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
as
long
as
I
could
bear
their
noise
;
but
they
are
so
unmanageable
*NL*
that
they
do
me
more
harm
than
good
.
Little
Charles
does
not
mind
a
*NL*
word
I
say
,
and
Walter
is
growing
quite
as
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
will
soon
be
better
now
,
''
replied
Anne
,
cheerfully
.
``
You
*NL*
know
I
always
cure
you
when
I
come
.
How
are
your
neighbours
at
the
*NL*
Great
House
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
give
you
no
account
of
them
.
I
have
not
seen
one
of
them
*NL*
to-day
,
except
Mr
Musgrove
,
who
just
stopped
and
spoke
through
the
*NL*
window
,
but
without
getting
off
his
horse
;
and
though
I
told
him
how
*NL*
ill
I
was
,
not
one
of
them
have
been
near
me
.
It
did
not
happen
to
*NL*
suit
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
I
suppose
,
and
they
never
put
themselves
out
*NL*
of
their
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
see
them
yet
,
perhaps
,
before
the
morning
is
gone

It
is
*NL*
early

*NL*
``
I
never
want

assure
you

talk
and
laugh
a
great
deal
too
*NL*
much
for
me
.
Oh
!
Anne
,
I
am
so
very
unwell
!
It
was
quite
unkind
of
*NL*
you
not
to
come
on
Thursday

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Mary
,
recollect
what
a
comfortable
account
you
sent
me
of
*NL*
yourself
!
You
wrote
in
the
cheerfullest
manner
,
and
said
you
were
*NL*
perfectly
well
,
and
in
no
hurry
for
me

that
being
the
case

you

must
be
aware
that
my
wish

be

remain
with
Lady
Russell
to
the
*NL*
last
:

besides
what
I
felt
on
her
account
,
I
have
really
been
so
*NL*
busy
,
have
had
so
much
to
do
,
that
I
could
not
very
conveniently
have
*NL*
left
Kellynch
sooner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
what
can
you
possibly
have
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
many
things
,
I
assure
you
.
More
than
I
can
recollect
in
a
*NL*
moment
;
but
I
can
tell
you
some
.
I
have
been
making
a
duplicate
of
the
*NL*
catalogue
of
my
father
's
books
and
pictures
.
I
have
been
several
times
*NL*
in
the
garden
with
Mackenzie
,
trying
to
understand
,
and
make
him
*NL*
understand
,
which
of
Elizabeth
's
plants
are
for
Lady
Russell
.
I
have
*NL*
had
all
my
own
little
concerns
to
arrange
,
books
and
music
to
divide
,
*NL*
and
all
my
trunks
to
repack
,
from
not
having
understood
in
time
what
*NL*
was
intended
as
to
the
waggons
:
and
one
thing
I
have
had
to
do
,
Mary
,
*NL*
of
a
more
trying
nature
:
going
to
almost
every
house
in
the
parish
,
as
*NL*
a
sort
of
take-leave
.
I
was
told
that
they
wished
it
.
But
all
these
*NL*
things
took
up
a
great
deal
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
well
!
''
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
``
but
you
have
never
asked
me
*NL*
one
word
about
our
dinner
at
the
Pooles
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
go
then
?
I
have
made
no
enquiries
,
because
I
concluded
you
*NL*
must
have
been
obliged
to
give
up
the
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
I
went
.
I
was
very
well
yesterday
;
nothing
at
all
the
matter
*NL*
with
me
till
this
morning
.
It
would
have
been
strange
if
I
had
not
*NL*
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
you
were
well
enough
,
and
I
hope
you
had
a
pleasant
*NL*
party

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
remarkable
.
One
always
knows
beforehand
what
the
dinner
will
*NL*
be
,
and
who
will
be
there
;
and
it
is
so
very
uncomfortable
not
having
a
*NL*
carriage
of
one
's
own
.
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
took
me
,
and
we
were
so
*NL*
crowded
!
They
are
both
so
very
large
,
and
take
up
so
much
room
;
and
Mr
*NL*
Musgrove
always
sits
forward
.
So
,
there
was
I
,
crowded
into
the
back
*NL*
seat
with
Henrietta
and
Louisa
;
and
I
think
it
very
likely
that
my
*NL*
illness
to-day
may
be
owing
to
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
A
little
further
perseverance
in
patience
and
forced
cheerfulness
on
*NL*
Anne
's
side
produced
nearly
a
cure
on
Mary
's
.
She
could
soon
sit
*NL*
upright
on
the
sofa
,
and
began
to
hope
she
might
be
able
to
leave
it
by
*NL*
dinner-time
.
Then
,
forgetting
to
think
of
it
,
she
was
at
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
room
,
beautifying
a
nosegay
;
then
,
she
ate
her
cold
meat
;
and
*NL*
then
she
was
well
enough
to
propose
a
little
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
shall
we
go
?
''
said
she
,
when
they
were
ready
.
``
I

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
the

replied
Anne
.
``
I
*NL*
should
never
think
of
standing
on
such
ceremony
with
people
I
know
so
*NL*
well
as
Mrs
and
the
Miss
Musgroves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
but
they
ought
to
call
upon
you
as
soon
as
possible
.
They
ought
*NL*
to
feel
what
is
due
to
you
as
my
sister
.
However
,
we
may
as
well
go
*NL*
and
sit
with
them
a
little
while
,
and
when
we
have
that
over
,
we
can
*NL*
enjoy
our
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
always
thought
such
a
style
of
intercourse
highly
imprudent
;
*NL*
but
she
had
ceased
to
endeavour
to
check
it
,
from
believing
that
,
*NL*
though
there
were
on
each
side
continual
subjects
of
offence
,
neither
*NL*
family
could
now
do
without
it
.
To
the
Great
House
accordingly
they
*NL*
went
,
to
sit
the
full
half
hour
in
the
old-fashioned
square
parlour
,
*NL*
with
a
small
carpet
and
shining
floor
,
to
which
the
present
daughters
*NL*
of
the
house
were
gradually
giving
the
proper
air
of
confusion
by
a
*NL*
grand
piano-forte
and
a
harp
,
flower-stands
and
little
tables
placed
in
*NL*
every
direction
.
Oh
!
could
the
originals
of
the
portraits
against
the
*NL*
wainscot
,
could
the
gentlemen
in
brown
velvet
and
the
ladies
in
blue
*NL*
satin
have
seen
what
was
going
on
,
have
been
conscious
of
such
an
*NL*
overthrow
of
all
order
and
neatness
!
The
portraits
themselves
seemed
*NL*
to
be
staring
in
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Musgroves
,
like
their
houses
,
were
in
a
state
of
alteration
,
*NL*
perhaps
of
improvement
.
The
father
and
mother
were
in
the
old
English
*NL*
style
,
and
the
young
people
in
the
new
.
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
were
a
*NL*
very
good
sort
of
people
;
friendly
and
hospitable
,
not
much
educated
,
*NL*
and
not
at
all
elegant
.
Their
children
had
more
modern
minds
and
*NL*
manners
.
There
was
a
numerous
family
;
but
the
only
two
grown
up
,
*NL*
excepting
Charles
,
were
Henrietta
and
Louisa
,
young
ladies
of
nineteen
*NL*
and
twenty
,
who
had
brought
from
school
at
Exeter
all
the
usual
stock
*NL*
of
accomplishments
,
and
were
now
like
thousands
of
other
young
ladies
,
*NL*
living
to
be
fashionable
,
happy
,
and
merry
.
Their
dress
had
every
*NL*
advantage
,
their
faces
were
rather
pretty
,
their
spirits
extremely
*NL*
good
,
their
manner
unembarrassed
and
pleasant
;
they
were
of
consequence
*NL*
at
home
,
and
favourites
abroad
.
Anne
always
contemplated
them
as
some
*NL*
of
the
happiest
creatures
of
her
acquaintance
;
but
still
,
saved
as
we
*NL*
all
are
,
by
some
comfortable
feeling
of
superiority
from
wishing
for
*NL*
the
possibility
of
exchange
,
she
would
not
have
given
up
her
own
more
*NL*
elegant
and
cultivated
mind
for
all
their
enjoyments
;
and
envied
them
*NL*
nothing
but
that
seemingly
perfect
good
understanding
and
agreement
*NL*
together
,
that
good-humoured
mutual
affection
,
of
which
she
had
known
*NL*
so
little
herself
with
either
of
her
sisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
received
with
great
cordiality
.
Nothing
seemed
amiss
on
the
*NL*
side
of
the
Great
House
family
,
which
was
generally
,
as
Anne
very
well
*NL*
knew
,
the
least
to
blame
.
The
half
hour
was
chatted
away
pleasantly
*NL*
enough
;
and
she
was
not
at
all
surprised
,
at
the
end
of
it
,
to
have
*NL*
their
walking
party
joined
by
both
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
at
Mary
's
*NL*
particular
invitation
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
not
wanted
this
visit
to
Uppercross
,
to
learn
that
a
removal
*NL*
from
one
set
of
people
to
another
,
though
at
a
distance
of
only
three
*NL*
miles
,
will
often
include
a
total
change
of
conversation
,
opinion
,
and
*NL*
idea
.
She
had
never
been
staying
there
before
,
without
being
struck
by
*NL*
it
,
or
without
wishing
that
other
Elliots
could
have
her
advantage
in
*NL*
seeing
how
unknown
,
or
unconsidered
there
,
were
the
affairs
which
at
*NL*
Kellynch
Hall
were
treated
as
of
such
general
publicity
and
pervading
*NL*
interest
;
yet
,
with
all
this
experience
,
she
believed
she
must
now
*NL*
submit
to
feel
that
another
lesson
,
in
the
art
of
knowing
our
own
*NL*
nothingness
beyond
our
own
circle
,
was
become
necessary
for
her
;
for
*NL*
certainly
,
coming
as
she
did
,
with
a
heart
full
of
the
subject
which
*NL*
had
been
completely
occupying
both
houses
in
Kellynch
for
many
weeks
,
*NL*
she
had
expected
rather
more
curiosity
and
sympathy
than
she
found
in
*NL*
the
separate
but
very
similar
remark
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
:
``
So
,
Miss
*NL*
Anne
,
Sir
Walter
and
your
sister
are
gone
;
and
what
part
of
Bath
do
you
*NL*
think
they
will
settle
in
?
''
and
this
,
without
much
waiting
for
an
*NL*
answer
;
or
in
the
young
ladies
'
addition
of
,
``
I
hope
we
shall
be
in
*NL*
Bath
in
the
winter
;
but
remember
,
papa
,
if
we
do
go
,
we
must
be
in
a
*NL*
good
situation
:
none
of
your
Queen
Squares
for
us
!
''
or
in
the
anxious
*NL*
supplement
from
Mary
,
of
--
``
Upon
my
word
,
I
shall
be
pretty
well
off
,
*NL*
when
you
are
all
gone
away
to
be
happy
at
Bath
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
only
resolve
to
avoid
such
self-delusion
in
future
,
and
think
*NL*
with
heightened
gratitude
of
the
extraordinary
blessing
of
having
one
*NL*
such
truly
sympathising
friend
as
Lady
Russell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mr
Musgroves
had
their
own
game
to
guard
,
and
to
destroy
,
their
own
*NL*
horses
,
dogs
,
and
newspapers
to
engage
them
,
and
the
females
were
fully
*NL*
occupied
in
all
the
other
common
subjects
of
housekeeping
,
neighbours
,
*NL*
dress
,
dancing
,
and
music
.
She
acknowledged
it
to
be
very
fitting
,
*NL*
that
every
little
social
commonwealth
should
dictate
its
own
matters
of
*NL*
discourse
;
and
hoped
,
ere
long
,
to
become
a
not
unworthy
member
of
the
*NL*
one
she
was
now
transplanted
into
.
With
the
prospect
of
spending
at
*NL*
least
two
months
at
Uppercross
,
it
was
highly
incumbent
on
her
to
*NL*
clothe
her
imagination
,
her
memory
,
and
all
her
ideas
in
as
much
of
*NL*
Uppercross
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
no
dread
of
these
two
months
.
Mary
was
not
so
repulsive
and
*NL*
unsisterly
as
Elizabeth
,
nor
so
inaccessible
to
all
influence
of
hers
;
*NL*
neither
was
there
anything
among
the
other
component
parts
of
the
*NL*
cottage
inimical
to
comfort
.
She
was
always
on
friendly
terms
with
her
*NL*
brother-in-law
;
and
in
the
children
,
who
loved
her
nearly
as
well
,
and
*NL*
respected
her
a
great
deal
more
than
their
mother
,
she
had
an
object
of
*NL*
interest
,
amusement
,
and
wholesome
exertion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
Musgrove
was
civil
and
agreeable
;
in
sense
and
temper
he
was
*NL*
undoubtedly
superior
to
his
wife
,
but
not
of
powers
,
or
conversation
,
*NL*
or
grace
,
to
make
the
past
,
as
they
were
connected
together
,
at
all
a
*NL*
dangerous
contemplation
;
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
Anne
could
believe
,
*NL*
with
Lady
Russell
,
that
a
more
equal
match
might
have
greatly
improved
*NL*
him
;
and
that
a
woman
of
real
understanding
might
have
given
more
*NL*
consequence
to
his
character
,
and
more
usefulness
,
rationality
,
and
*NL*
elegance
to
his
habits
and
pursuits
.
As
it
was
,
he
did
nothing
with
*NL*
much
zeal
,
but
sport
;
and
his
time
was
otherwise
trifled
away
,
without
*NL*
benefit
from
books
or
anything
else
.
He
had
very
good
spirits
,
which
*NL*
never
seemed
much
affected
by
his
wife
's
occasional
lowness
,
bore
with
*NL*
her
unreasonableness
sometimes
to
Anne
's
admiration
,
and
upon
the
*NL*
whole
,
though
there
was
very
often
a
little
disagreement
-LRB-
in
which
she
*NL*
had
sometimes
more
share
than
she
wished
,
being
appealed
to
by
both
*NL*
parties
-RRB-
,
they
might
pass
for
a
happy
couple
.
They
were
always
*NL*
perfectly
agreed
in
the
want
of
more
money
,
and
a
strong
inclination
*NL*
for
a
handsome
present
from
his
father
;
but
here
,
as
on
most
topics
,
he
*NL*
had
the
superiority
,
for
while
Mary
thought
it
a
great
shame
that
such
*NL*
a
present
was
not
made
,
he
always
contended
for
his
father
's
having
*NL*
many
other
uses
for
his
money
,
and
a
right
to
spend
it
as
he
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
management
of
their
children
,
his
theory
was
much
better
than
*NL*
his
wife
's
,
and
his
practice
not
so
bad
.
``
I
could
manage
them
very
*NL*
well
,
if
it
were
not
for
Mary
's
interference
,
''
was
what
Anne
often
*NL*
heard
him
say
,
and
had
a
good
deal
of
faith
in
;
but
when
listening
in
*NL*
turn
to
Mary
's
reproach
of
``
Charles
spoils
the
children
so
that
I
*NL*
can
not
get
them
into
any
order
,
''
she
never
had
the
smallest
temptation
*NL*
to
say
,
``
Very
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
least
agreeable
circumstances
of
her
residence
there
was
her
*NL*
being
treated
with
too
much
confidence
by
all
parties
,
and
being
too
*NL*
much
in
the
secret
of
the
complaints
of
each
house
.
Known
to
have
some
*NL*
influence
with
her
sister
,
she
was
continually
requested
,
or
at
least
*NL*
receiving
hints
to
exert
it
,
beyond
what
was
practicable
.
``
I
wish
you
*NL*
could
persuade
Mary
not
to
be
always
fancying
herself
ill
,
''
was
*NL*
Charles
's
language
;
and
,
in
an
unhappy
mood
,
thus
spoke
Mary
:
``
I
do
*NL*
believe
if
Charles
were
to
see
me
dying
,
he
would
not
think
there
was
*NL*
anything
the
matter
with
me
.
I
am
sure
,
Anne
,
if
you
would
,
you
might
*NL*
persuade
him
that
I
really
am
very
ill
--
a
great
deal
worse
than
I
ever
*NL*
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
declaration
was
,
``
I
hate
sending
the
children
to
the
Great
*NL*
House
,
though
their
grandmamma
is
always
wanting
to
see
them
,
for
she
*NL*
humours
and
indulges
them
to
such
a
degree
,
and
gives
them
so
much
*NL*
trash
and
sweet
things
,
that
they
are
sure
to
come
back
sick
and
cross
*NL*
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
''
And
Mrs
Musgrove
took
the
first
opportunity
*NL*
of
being
alone
with
Anne
,
to
say
,
``
Oh
!
Miss
Anne
,
I
can
not
help
wishing
*NL*
Mrs
Charles
had
a
little
of
your
method
with
those
children
.
They
are
*NL*
quite
different
creatures
with
you
!
But
to
be
sure
,
in
general
they
*NL*
are
so
spoilt
!
It
is
a
pity
you
can
not
put
your
sister
in
the
way
of
*NL*
managing
them
.
They
are
as
fine
healthy
children
as
ever
were
seen
,
*NL*
poor
little
dears
!
without
partiality
;
but
Mrs
Charles
knows
no
more
*NL*
how
they
should
be
treated
--
!
Bless
me
!
how
troublesome
they
are
*NL*
sometimes
.
I
assure
you
,
Miss
Anne
,
it
prevents
my
wishing
to
see
them
*NL*
at
our
house
so
often
as
I
otherwise
should
.
I
believe
Mrs
Charles
is
*NL*
not
quite
pleased
with
my
not
inviting
them
oftener
;
but
you
know
it
is
*NL*
very
bad
to
have
children
with
one
that
one
is
obligated
to
be
checking
*NL*
every
moment
;
``
do
n't
do
this
,
''
and
``
do
n't
do
that
;
''
or
that
one
can
*NL*
only
keep
in
tolerable
order
by
more
cake
than
is
good
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
this
communication
,
moreover
,
from
Mary
.
``
Mrs
Musgrove
thinks
*NL*
all
her
servants
so
steady
,
that
it
would
be
high
treason
to
call
it
in
*NL*
question
;
but
I
am
sure
,
without
exaggeration
,
that
her
upper
*NL*
house-maid
and
laundry-maid
,
instead
of
being
in
their
business
,
are
*NL*
gadding
about
the
village
,
all
day
long
.
I
meet
them
wherever
I
go
;
*NL*
and
I
declare
,
I
never
go
twice
into
my
nursery
without
seeing
*NL*
something
of
them
.
If
Jemima
were
not
the
trustiest
,
steadiest
*NL*
creature
in
the
world
,
it
would
be
enough
to
spoil
her
;
for
she
tells
*NL*
me
,
they
are
always
tempting
her
to
take
a
walk
with
them
.
''
And
on
Mrs
*NL*
Musgrove
's
side
,
it
was
,
``
I
make
a
rule
of
never
interfering
in
any
of
*NL*
my
daughter-in-law
's
concerns
,
for
I
know
it
would
not
do
;
but
I
shall
*NL*
tell
you
,
Miss
Anne
,
because
you
may
be
able
to
set
things
to
rights
,
*NL*
that
I
have
no
very
good
opinion
of
Mrs
Charles
's
nursery-maid
:
I
hear
*NL*
strange
stories
of
her
;
she
is
always
upon
the
gad
;
and
from
my
own
*NL*
knowledge
,
I
can
declare
,
she
is
such
a
fine-dressing
lady
,
that
she
is
*NL*
enough
to
ruin
any
servants
she
comes
near
.
Mrs
Charles
quite
swears
*NL*
by
her
,
I
know
;
but
I
just
give
you
this
hint
,
that
you
may
be
upon
the
*NL*
watch
;
because
,
if
you
see
anything
amiss
,
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
*NL*
mentioning
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
it
was
Mary
's
complaint
,
that
Mrs
Musgrove
was
very
apt
not
to
*NL*
give
her
the
precedence
that
was
her
due
,
when
they
dined
at
the
Great
*NL*
House
with
other
families
;
and
she
did
not
see
any
reason
why
she
was
*NL*
to
be
considered
so
much
at
home
as
to
lose
her
place
.
And
one
day
*NL*
when
Anne
was
walking
with
only
the
Musgroves
,
one
of
them
after
*NL*
talking
of
rank
,
people
of
rank
,
and
jealousy
of
rank
,
said
,
``
I
have
no
*NL*
scruple
of
observing
to
you
,
how
nonsensical
some
persons
are
about
*NL*
their
place
,
because
all
the
world
knows
how
easy
and
indifferent
you
*NL*
are
about
it
;
but
I
wish
anybody
could
give
Mary
a
hint
that
it
would
*NL*
be
a
great
deal
better
if
she
were
not
so
very
tenacious
,
especially
if
*NL*
she
would
not
be
always
putting
herself
forward
to
take
place
of
mamma
.
*NL*
Nobody
doubts
her
right
to
have
precedence
of
mamma
,
but
it
would
be
*NL*
more
becoming
in
her
not
to
be
always
insisting
on
it
.
It
is
not
that
*NL*
mamma
cares
about
it
the
least
in
the
world
,
but
I
know
it
is
taken
*NL*
notice
of
by
many
persons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
was
Anne
to
set
all
these
matters
to
rights
?
She
could
do
little
*NL*
more
than
listen
patiently
,
soften
every
grievance
,
and
excuse
each
to
*NL*
the
other
;
give
them
all
hints
of
the
forbearance
necessary
between
*NL*
such
near
neighbours
,
and
make
those
hints
broadest
which
were
meant
*NL*
for
her
sister
's
benefit
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
other
respects
,
her
visit
began
and
proceeded
very
well
.
Her
*NL*
own
spirits
improved
by
change
of
place
and
subject
,
by
being
removed
*NL*
three
miles
from
Kellynch
;
Mary
's
ailments
lessened
by
having
a
*NL*
constant
companion
,
and
their
daily
intercourse
with
the
other
family
,
*NL*
since
there
was
neither
superior
affection
,
confidence
,
nor
employment
*NL*
in
the
cottage
,
to
be
interrupted
by
it
,
was
rather
an
advantage
.
It
*NL*
was
certainly
carried
nearly
as
far
as
possible
,
for
they
met
every
*NL*
morning
,
and
hardly
ever
spent
an
evening
asunder
;
but
she
believed
*NL*
they
should
not
have
done
so
well
without
the
sight
of
Mr
and
Mrs
*NL*
Musgrove
's
respectable
forms
in
the
usual
places
,
or
without
the
*NL*
talking
,
laughing
,
and
singing
of
their
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
played
a
great
deal
better
than
either
of
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
but
*NL*
having
no
voice
,
no
knowledge
of
the
harp
,
and
no
fond
parents
,
to
sit
*NL*
by
and
fancy
themselves
delighted
,
her
performance
was
little
thought
*NL*
of
,
only
out
of
civility
,
or
to
refresh
the
others
,
as
she
was
well
*NL*
aware
.
She
knew
that
when
she
played
she
was
giving
pleasure
only
to
*NL*
herself
;
but
this
was
no
new
sensation
.
Excepting
one
short
period
of
*NL*
her
life
,
she
had
never
,
since
the
age
of
fourteen
,
never
since
the
*NL*
loss
of
her
dear
mother
,
known
the
happiness
of
being
listened
to
,
or
*NL*
encouraged
by
any
just
appreciation
or
real
taste
.
In
music
she
had
*NL*
been
always
used
to
feel
alone
in
the
world
;
and
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
*NL*
fond
partiality
for
their
own
daughters
'
performance
,
and
total
*NL*
indifference
to
any
other
person
's
,
gave
her
much
more
pleasure
for
*NL*
their
sakes
,
than
mortification
for
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
at
the
Great
House
was
sometimes
increased
by
other
company
.
*NL*
The
neighbourhood
was
not
large
,
but
the
Musgroves
were
visited
by
*NL*
everybody
,
and
had
more
dinner-parties
,
and
more
callers
,
more
visitors
*NL*
by
invitation
and
by
chance
,
than
any
other
family
.
They
were
more
*NL*
completely
popular
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
were
wild
for
dancing
;
and
the
evenings
ended
,
occasionally
,
*NL*
in
an
unpremeditated
little
ball
.
There
was
a
family
of
cousins
within
*NL*
a
walk
of
Uppercross
,
in
less
affluent
circumstances
,
who
depended
on
*NL*
the
Musgroves
for
all
their
pleasures
:
they
would
come
at
any
time
,
*NL*
and
help
play
at
anything
,
or
dance
anywhere
;
and
Anne
,
very
much
*NL*
preferring
the
office
of
musician
to
a
more
active
post
,
played
country
*NL*
dances
to
them
by
the
hour
together
;
a
kindness
which
always
*NL*
recommended
her
musical
powers
to
the
notice
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
*NL*
more
than
anything
else
,
and
often
drew
this
compliment
;
--
``
Well
done
,
*NL*
Miss
Anne
!
very
well
done
indeed
!
Lord
bless
me
!
how
those
little
*NL*
fingers
of
yours
fly
about
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
passed
the
first
three
weeks
.
Michaelmas
came
;
and
now
Anne
's
heart
*NL*
must
be
in
Kellynch
again
.
A
beloved
home
made
over
to
others
;
all
the
*NL*
precious
rooms
and
furniture
,
groves
,
and
prospects
,
beginning
to
own
*NL*
other
eyes
and
other
limbs
!
She
could
not
think
of
much
else
on
the
*NL*
29th
of
September
;
and
she
had
this
sympathetic
touch
in
the
evening
*NL*
from
Mary
,
who
,
on
having
occasion
to
note
down
the
day
of
the
month
,
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
Dear
me
,
is
not
this
the
day
the
Crofts
were
to
come
to
*NL*
Kellynch
?
I
am
glad
I
did
not
think
of
it
before
.
How
low
it
makes
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Crofts
took
possession
with
true
naval
alertness
,
and
were
to
be
*NL*
visited
.
Mary
deplored
the
necessity
for
herself
.
``
Nobody
knew
how
*NL*
much
she
should
suffer
.
She
should
put
it
off
as
long
as
she
could
;
''
*NL*
but
was
not
easy
till
she
had
talked
Charles
into
driving
her
over
on
*NL*
an
early
day
,
and
was
in
a
very
animated
,
comfortable
state
of
*NL*
imaginary
agitation
,
when
she
came
back
.
Anne
had
very
sincerely
*NL*
rejoiced
in
there
being
no
means
of
her
going
.
She
wished
,
however
to
*NL*
see
the
Crofts
,
and
was
glad
to
be
within
when
the
visit
was
returned
.
*NL*
They
came
:
the
master
of
the
house
was
not
at
home
,
but
the
two
*NL*
sisters
were
together
;
and
as
it
chanced
that
Mrs
Croft
fell
to
the
*NL*
share
of
Anne
,
while
the
Admiral
sat
by
Mary
,
and
made
himself
very
*NL*
agreeable
by
his
good-humoured
notice
of
her
little
boys
,
she
was
well
*NL*
able
to
watch
for
a
likeness
,
and
if
it
failed
her
in
the
features
,
to
*NL*
catch
it
in
the
voice
,
or
in
the
turn
of
sentiment
and
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Croft
,
though
neither
tall
nor
fat
,
had
a
squareness
,
uprightness
,
*NL*
and
vigour
of
form
,
which
gave
importance
to
her
person
.
She
had
*NL*
bright
dark
eyes
,
good
teeth
,
and
altogether
an
agreeable
face
;
though
*NL*
her
reddened
and
weather-beaten
complexion
,
the
consequence
of
her
*NL*
having
been
almost
as
much
at
sea
as
her
husband
,
made
her
seem
to
have
*NL*
lived
some
years
longer
in
the
world
than
her
real
eight-and-thirty
.
*NL*
Her
manners
were
open
,
easy
,
and
decided
,
like
one
who
had
no
distrust
*NL*
of
herself
,
and
no
doubts
of
what
to
do
;
without
any
approach
to
*NL*
coarseness
,
however
,
or
any
want
of
good
humour
.
Anne
gave
her
credit
,
*NL*
indeed
,
for
feelings
of
great
consideration
towards
herself
,
in
all
*NL*
that
related
to
Kellynch
,
and
it
pleased
her
:
especially
,
as
she
had
*NL*
satisfied
herself
in
the
very
first
half
minute
,
in
the
instant
even
of
*NL*
introduction
,
that
there
was
not
the
smallest
symptom
of
any
knowledge
*NL*
or
suspicion
on
Mrs
Croft
's
side
,
to
give
a
bias
of
any
sort
.
She
was
*NL*
quite
easy
on
that
head
,
and
consequently
full
of
strength
and
courage
,
*NL*
till
for
a
moment
electrified
by
Mrs
Croft
's
suddenly
saying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
you
,
and
not
your
sister
,
I
find
,
that
my
brother
had
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
being
acquainted
with
,
when
he
was
in
this
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
hoped
she
had
outlived
the
age
of
blushing
;
but
the
age
of
emotion
*NL*
she
certainly
had
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
may
not
have
heard
that
he
is
married
?
''
added
Mrs
Croft
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
now
answer
as
she
ought
;
and
was
happy
to
feel
,
when
Mrs
*NL*
Croft
's
next
words
explained
it
to
be
Mr
Wentworth
of
whom
she
spoke
,
*NL*
that
she
had
said
nothing
which
might
not
do
for
either
brother
.
She
*NL*
immediately
felt
how
reasonable
it
was
,
that
Mrs
Croft
should
be
*NL*
thinking
and
speaking
of
Edward
,
and
not
of
Frederick
;
and
with
shame
*NL*
at
her
own
forgetfulness
applied
herself
to
the
knowledge
of
their
*NL*
former
neighbour
's
present
state
with
proper
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
was
all
tranquillity
;
till
,
just
as
they
were
moving
,
she
*NL*
heard
the
Admiral
say
to
Mary
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
expecting
a
brother
of
Mrs
Croft
's
here
soon
;
I
dare
say
you
*NL*
know
him
by
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
cut
short
by
the
eager
attacks
of
the
little
boys
,
clinging
to
*NL*
him
like
an
old
friend
,
and
declaring
he
should
not
go
;
and
being
too
*NL*
much
engrossed
by
proposals
of
carrying
them
away
in
his
coat
pockets
,
*NL*
&
c.
,
to
have
another
moment
for
finishing
or
recollecting
what
he
had
*NL*
begun
,
Anne
was
left
to
persuade
herself
,
as
well
as
she
could
,
that
*NL*
the
same
brother
must
still
be
in
question
.
She
could
not
,
however
,
*NL*
reach
such
a
degree
of
certainty
,
as
not
to
be
anxious
to
hear
whether
*NL*
anything
had
been
said
on
the
subject
at
the
other
house
,
where
the
*NL*
Crofts
had
previously
been
calling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
folks
of
the
Great
House
were
to
spend
the
evening
of
this
day
at
*NL*
the
Cottage
;
and
it
being
now
too
late
in
the
year
for
such
visits
to
*NL*
be
made
on
foot
,
the
coach
was
beginning
to
be
listened
for
,
when
the
*NL*
youngest
Miss
Musgrove
walked
in
.
That
she
was
coming
to
apologize
,
*NL*
and
that
they
should
have
to
spend
the
evening
by
themselves
,
was
the
*NL*
first
black
idea
;
and
Mary
was
quite
ready
to
be
affronted
,
when
Louisa
*NL*
made
all
right
by
saying
,
that
she
only
came
on
foot
,
to
leave
more
*NL*
room
for
the
harp
,
which
was
bringing
in
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
will
tell
you
our
reason
,
''
she
added
,
``
and
all
about
it
.
I
am
*NL*
come
on
to
give
you
notice
,
that
papa
and
mamma
are
out
of
spirits
this
*NL*
evening
,
especially
mamma
;
she
is
thinking
so
much
of
poor
Richard
!
*NL*
And
we
agreed
it
would
be
best
to
have
the
harp
,
for
it
seems
to
amuse
*NL*
her
more
than
the
piano-forte
.
I
will
tell
you
why
she
is
out
of
*NL*
spirits
.
When
the
Crofts
called
this
morning
,
-LRB-
they
called
here
*NL*
afterwards
,
did
not
they
?
-RRB-
,
they
happened
to
say
,
that
her
brother
,
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
,
is
just
returned
to
England
,
or
paid
off
,
or
*NL*
something
,
and
is
coming
to
see
them
almost
directly
;
and
most
*NL*
unluckily
it
came
into
mamma
's
head
,
when
they
were
gone
,
that
*NL*
Wentworth
,
or
something
very
like
it
,
was
the
name
of
poor
Richard
's
*NL*
captain
at
one
time
;
I
do
not
know
when
or
where
,
but
a
great
while
*NL*
before
he
died
,
poor
fellow
!
And
upon
looking
over
his
letters
and
*NL*
things
,
she
found
it
was
so
,
and
is
perfectly
sure
that
this
must
be
*NL*
the
very
man
,
and
her
head
is
quite
full
of
it
,
and
of
poor
Richard
!
*NL*
So
we
must
be
as
merry
as
we
can
,
that
she
may
not
be
dwelling
upon
*NL*
such
gloomy
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
real
circumstances
of
this
pathetic
piece
of
family
history
were
,
*NL*
that
the
Musgroves
had
had
the
ill
fortune
of
a
very
troublesome
,
*NL*
hopeless
son
;
and
the
good
fortune
to
lose
him
before
he
reached
his
*NL*
twentieth
year
;
that
he
had
been
sent
to
sea
because
he
was
stupid
and
*NL*
unmanageable
on
shore
;
that
he
had
been
very
little
cared
for
at
any
*NL*
time
by
his
family
,
though
quite
as
much
as
he
deserved
;
seldom
heard
*NL*
of
,
and
scarcely
at
all
regretted
,
when
the
intelligence
of
his
death
*NL*
abroad
had
worked
its
way
to
Uppercross
,
two
years
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
in
fact
,
though
his
sisters
were
now
doing
all
they
could
for
*NL*
him
,
by
calling
him
``
poor
Richard
,
''
been
nothing
better
than
a
*NL*
thick-headed
,
unfeeling
,
unprofitable
Dick
Musgrove
,
who
had
never
done
*NL*
anything
to
entitle
himself
to
more
than
the
abbreviation
of
his
name
,
*NL*
living
or
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
several
years
at
sea
,
and
had
,
in
the
course
of
those
*NL*
removals
to
which
all
midshipmen
are
liable
,
and
especially
such
*NL*
midshipmen
as
every
captain
wishes
to
get
rid
of
,
been
six
months
on
*NL*
board
Captain
Frederick
Wentworth
's
frigate
,
the
Laconia
;
and
from
the
*NL*
Laconia
he
had
,
under
the
influence
of
his
captain
,
written
the
only
*NL*
two
letters
which
his
father
and
mother
had
ever
received
from
him
*NL*
during
the
whole
of
his
absence
;
that
is
to
say
,
the
only
two
*NL*
disinterested
letters
;
all
the
rest
had
been
mere
applications
for
*NL*
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
each
letter
he
had
spoken
well
of
his
captain
;
but
yet
,
so
little
*NL*
were
they
in
the
habit
of
attending
to
such
matters
,
so
unobservant
and
*NL*
incurious
were
they
as
to
the
names
of
men
or
ships
,
that
it
had
made
*NL*
scarcely
any
impression
at
the
time
;
and
that
Mrs
Musgrove
should
have
*NL*
been
suddenly
struck
,
this
very
day
,
with
a
recollection
of
the
name
of
*NL*
Wentworth
,
as
connected
with
her
son
,
seemed
one
of
those
extraordinary
*NL*
bursts
of
mind
which
do
sometimes
occur
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
gone
to
her
letters
,
and
found
it
all
as
she
supposed
;
and
the
*NL*
re-perusal
of
these
letters
,
after
so
long
an
interval
,
her
poor
son
*NL*
gone
for
ever
,
and
all
the
strength
of
his
faults
forgotten
,
had
*NL*
affected
her
spirits
exceedingly
,
and
thrown
her
into
greater
grief
for
*NL*
him
than
she
had
known
on
first
hearing
of
his
death
.
Mr
Musgrove
was
,
*NL*
in
a
lesser
degree
,
affected
likewise
;
and
when
they
reached
the
*NL*
cottage
,
they
were
evidently
in
want
,
first
,
of
being
listened
to
anew
*NL*
on
this
subject
,
and
afterwards
,
of
all
the
relief
which
cheerful
*NL*
companions
could
give
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
hear
them
talking
so
much
of
Captain
Wentworth
,
repeating
his
name
*NL*
so
often
,
puzzling
over
past
years
,
and
at
last
ascertaining
that
it
*NL*
might
,
that
it
probably
would
,
turn
out
to
be
the
very
same
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
whom
they
recollected
meeting
,
once
or
twice
,
after
their
*NL*
coming
back
from
Clifton
--
a
very
fine
young
man
--
but
they
could
not
say
*NL*
whether
it
was
seven
or
eight
years
ago
,
was
a
new
sort
of
trial
to
*NL*
Anne
's
nerves
.
She
found
,
however
,
that
it
was
one
to
which
she
must
*NL*
inure
herself
.
Since
he
actually
was
expected
in
the
country
,
she
must
*NL*
teach
herself
to
be
insensible
on
such
points
.
And
not
only
did
it
*NL*
appear
that
he
was
expected
,
and
speedily
,
but
the
Musgroves
,
in
their
*NL*
warm
gratitude
for
the
kindness
he
had
shewn
poor
Dick
,
and
very
high
*NL*
respect
for
his
character
,
stamped
as
it
was
by
poor
Dick
's
having
been
*NL*
six
months
under
his
care
,
and
mentioning
him
in
strong
,
though
not
*NL*
perfectly
well-spelt
praise
,
as
``
a
fine
dashing
felow
,
only
two
*NL*
perticular
about
the
schoolmaster
,
''
were
bent
on
introducing
*NL*
themselves
,
and
seeking
his
acquaintance
,
as
soon
as
they
could
hear
of
*NL*
his
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
resolution
of
doing
so
helped
to
form
the
comfort
of
their
evening
.

Chapter
7
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
few
days
more
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
was
known
to
be
at
*NL*
Kellynch
,
and
Mr
Musgrove
had
called
on
him
,
and
come
back
warm
in
his
*NL*
praise
,
and
he
was
engaged
with
the
Crofts
to
dine
at
Uppercross
,
by
*NL*
the
end
of
another
week
.
It
had
been
a
great
disappointment
to
Mr
*NL*
Musgrove
to
find
that
no
earlier
day
could
be
fixed
,
so
impatient
was
*NL*
he
to
shew
his
gratitude
,
by
seeing
Captain
Wentworth
under
his
own
*NL*
roof
,
and
welcoming
him
to
all
that
was
strongest
and
best
in
his
*NL*
cellars
.
But
a
week
must
pass
;
only
a
week
,
in
Anne
's
reckoning
,
and
*NL*
then
,
she
supposed
,
they
must
meet
;
and
soon
she
began
to
wish
that
she
*NL*
could
feel
secure
even
for
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
made
a
very
early
return
to
Mr
Musgrove
's
civility
,
*NL*
and
she
was
all
but
calling
there
in
the
same
half
hour
.
She
and
Mary
*NL*
were
actually
setting
forward
for
the
Great
House
,
where
,
as
she
*NL*
afterwards
learnt
,
they
must
inevitably
have
found
him
,
when
they
were
*NL*
stopped
by
the
eldest
boy
's
being
at
that
moment
brought
home
in
*NL*
consequence
of
a
bad
fall
.
The
child
's
situation
put
the
visit
*NL*
entirely
aside
;
but
she
could
not
hear
of
her
escape
with
indifference
,
*NL*
even
in
the
midst
of
the
serious
anxiety
which
they
afterwards
felt
on
*NL*
his
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
collar-bone
was
found
to
be
dislocated
,
and
such
injury
received
in
*NL*
the
back
,
as
roused
the
most
alarming
ideas
.
It
was
an
afternoon
of
*NL*
distress
,
and
Anne
had
every
thing
to
do
at
once
;
the
apothecary
to
*NL*
send
for
,
the
father
to
have
pursued
and
informed
,
the
mother
to
*NL*
support
and
keep
from
hysterics
,
the
servants
to
control
,
the
youngest
*NL*
child
to
banish
,
and
the
poor
suffering
one
to
attend
and
soothe
;
*NL*
besides
sending
,
as
soon
as
she
recollected
it
,
proper
notice
to
the
*NL*
other
house
,
which
brought
her
an
accession
rather
of
frightened
,
*NL*
enquiring
companions
,
than
of
very
useful
assistants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
's
return
was
the
first
comfort
;
he
could
take
best
care
of
*NL*
his
wife
;
and
the
second
blessing
was
the
arrival
of
the
apothecary
.
*NL*
Till
he
came
and
had
examined
the
child
,
their
apprehensions
were
the
*NL*
worse
for
being
vague
;
they
suspected
great
injury
,
but
knew
not
where
;
*NL*
but
now
the
collar-bone
was
soon
replaced
,
and
though
Mr
Robinson
felt
*NL*
and
felt
,
and
rubbed
,
and
looked
grave
,
and
spoke
low
words
both
to
the
*NL*
father
and
the
aunt
,
still
they
were
all
to
hope
the
best
,
and
to
be
*NL*
able
to
part
and
eat
their
dinner
in
tolerable
ease
of
mind
;
and
then
*NL*
it
was
,
just
before
they
parted
,
that
the
two
young
aunts
were
able
so
*NL*
far
to
digress
from
their
nephew
's
state
,
as
to
give
the
information
of
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
's
visit
;
staying
five
minutes
behind
their
father
and
*NL*
mother
,
to
endeavour
to
express
how
perfectly
delighted
they
were
with
*NL*
him
,
how
much
handsomer
,
how
infinitely
more
agreeable
they
thought
him
*NL*
than
any
individual
among
their
male
acquaintance
,
who
had
been
at
all
*NL*
a
favourite
before
.
How
glad
they
had
been
to
hear
papa
invite
him
to
*NL*
stay
dinner
,
how
sorry
when
he
said
it
was
quite
out
of
his
power
,
and
*NL*
how
glad
again
when
he
had
promised
in
reply
to
papa
and
mamma
's
*NL*
farther
pressing
invitations
to
come
and
dine
with
them
on
the
*NL*
morrow
--
actually
on
the
morrow
;
and
he
had
promised
it
in
so
pleasant
a
*NL*
manner
,
as
if
he
felt
all
the
motive
of
their
attention
just
as
he
*NL*
ought
.
And
in
short
,
he
had
looked
and
said
everything
with
such
*NL*
exquisite
grace
,
that
they
could
assure
them
all
,
their
heads
were
both
*NL*
turned
by
him
;
and
off
they
ran
,
quite
as
full
of
glee
as
of
love
,
and
*NL*
apparently
more
full
of
Captain
Wentworth
than
of
little
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
story
and
the
same
raptures
were
repeated
,
when
the
two
girls
*NL*
came
with
their
father
,
through
the
gloom
of
the
evening
,
to
make
*NL*
enquiries
;
and
Mr
Musgrove
,
no
longer
under
the
first
uneasiness
about
*NL*
his
heir
,
could
add
his
confirmation
and
praise
,
and
hope
there
would
*NL*
be
now
no
occasion
for
putting
Captain
Wentworth
off
,
and
only
be
sorry
*NL*
to
think
that
the
cottage
party
,
probably
,
would
not
like
to
leave
the
*NL*
little
boy
,
to
give
him
the
meeting
.
``
Oh
no
;
as
to
leaving
the
little
*NL*
boy
,
''
both
father
and
mother
were
in
much
too
strong
and
recent
alarm
*NL*
to
bear
the
thought
;
and
Anne
,
in
the
joy
of
the
escape
,
could
not
help
*NL*
adding
her
warm
protestations
to
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
Musgrove
,
indeed
,
afterwards
,
shewed
more
of
inclination
;
``
the
*NL*
child
was
going
on
so
well
,
and
he
wished
so
much
to
be
introduced
to
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
,
that
,
perhaps
,
he
might
join
them
in
the
evening
;
he
*NL*
would
not
dine
from
home
,
but
he
might
walk
in
for
half
an
hour
.
''
But
*NL*
in
this
he
was
eagerly
opposed
by
his
wife
,
with
``
Oh
!
no
,
indeed
,
*NL*
Charles
,
I
can
not
bear
to
have
you
go
away
.
Only
think
if
anything
*NL*
should
happen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
had
a
good
night
,
and
was
going
on
well
the
next
day
.
It
*NL*
must
be
a
work
of
time
to
ascertain
that
no
injury
had
been
done
to
the
*NL*
spine
;
but
Mr
Robinson
found
nothing
to
increase
alarm
,
and
Charles
*NL*
Musgrove
began
,
consequently
,
to
feel
no
necessity
for
longer
*NL*
confinement
.
The
child
was
to
be
kept
in
bed
and
amused
as
quietly
as
*NL*
possible
;
but
what
was
there
for
a
father
to
do
?
This
was
quite
a
*NL*
female
case
,
and
it
would
be
highly
absurd
in
him
,
who
could
be
of
no
*NL*
use
at
home
,
to
shut
himself
up
.
His
father
very
much
wished
him
to
*NL*
meet
Captain
Wentworth
,
and
there
being
no
sufficient
reason
against
*NL*
it
,
he
ought
to
go
;
and
it
ended
in
his
making
a
bold
,
public
*NL*
declaration
,
when
he
came
in
from
shooting
,
of
his
meaning
to
dress
*NL*
directly
,
and
dine
at
the
other
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
can
be
going
on
better
than
the
child
,
''
said
he
;
``
so
I
told
my
*NL*
father
,
just
now
,
that
I
would
come
,
and
he
thought
me
quite
right
.
*NL*
Your
sister
being
with
you
,
my
love
,
I
have
no
scruple
at
all
.
You
*NL*
would
not
like
to
leave
him
yourself
,
but
you
see
I
can
be
of
no
use
.
*NL*
Anne
will
send
for
me
if
anything
is
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Husbands
and
wives
generally
understand
when
opposition
will
be
vain
.
*NL*
Mary
knew
,
from
Charles
's
manner
of
speaking
,
that
he
was
quite
*NL*
determined
on
going
,
and
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
teaze
him
.
She
*NL*
said
nothing
,
therefore
,
till
he
was
out
of
the
room
,
but
as
soon
as
*NL*
there
was
only
Anne
to
hear
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
and
I
are
to
be
left
to
shift
by
ourselves
,
with
this
poor
sick
*NL*
child
;
and
not
a
creature
coming
near
us
all
the
evening
!
I
knew
how
*NL*
it
would
be
.
This
is
always
my
luck
.
If
there
is
anything
*NL*
disagreeable
going
on
men
are
always
sure
to
get
out
of
it
,
and
Charles
*NL*
is
as
bad
as
any
of
them
.
Very
unfeeling
!
I
must
say
it
is
very
*NL*
unfeeling
of
him
to
be
running
away
from
his
poor
little
boy
.
Talks
of
*NL*
his
being
going
on
so
well
!
How
does
he
know
that
he
is
going
on
well
,
*NL*
or
that
there
may
not
be
a
sudden
change
half
an
hour
hence
?
I
did
not
*NL*
think
Charles
would
have
been
so
unfeeling
.
So
here
he
is
to
go
away
*NL*
and
enjoy
himself
,
and
because
I
am
the
poor
mother
,
I
am
not
to
be
*NL*
allowed
to
stir
;
and
yet
,
I
am
sure
,
I
am
more
unfit
than
anybody
else
*NL*
to
be
about
the
child
.
My
being
the
mother
is
the
very
reason
why
my
*NL*
feelings
should
not
be
tried
.
I
am
not
at
all
equal
to
it
.
You
saw
*NL*
how
hysterical
I
was
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
was
only
the
effect
of
the
suddenness
of
your
alarm
--
of
the
*NL*
shock
.
You
will
not
be
hysterical
again
.
I
dare
say
we
shall
have
*NL*
nothing
to
distress
us
.
I
perfectly
understand
Mr
Robinson
's
*NL*
directions
,
and
have
no
fears
;
and
indeed
,
Mary
,
I
can
not
wonder
at
*NL*
your
husband
.
Nursing
does
not
belong
to
a
man
;
it
is
not
his
*NL*
province
.
A
sick
child
is
always
the
mother
's
property
:
her
own
*NL*
feelings
generally
make
it
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
am
as
fond
of
my
child
as
any
mother
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
*NL*
I
am
of
any
more
use
in
the
sick-room
than
Charles
,
for
I
can
not
be
*NL*
always
scolding
and
teazing
the
poor
child
when
it
is
ill
;
and
you
saw
,
*NL*
this
morning
,
that
if
I
told
him
to
keep
quiet
,
he
was
sure
to
begin
*NL*
kicking
about

I
have
not
nerves
for
the
sort
of
thing

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

could
you
be
comfortable
yourself

Yes

I
mean
to
go
with
you
,
Charles
,
for
I
am
of
no
more
use
at
home
than
*NL*
you
are
.
If
I
were
to
shut
myself
up
for
ever
with
the
child
,
I
should
*NL*
not
be
able
to
persuade
him
to

anything
he
did
not
like

Anne
will
*NL*
stay
;
Anne
undertakes
to
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
him
.
It
is
*NL*
Anne
's
own
proposal
,
and
so
I
shall
go
with
you
,
which
will
be
a
great
*NL*
deal
better
,
for
I
have
not
dined
at
the
other
house
since
Tuesday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
very
kind
of
Anne
,
''
was
her
husband
's
answer
,
``
and
I
should
be
*NL*
very
glad
to
have
you
go
;
but
it
seems
rather
hard
that
she
should
be
*NL*
left
at
home
by
herself
,
to
nurse
our
sick
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
now
at
hand
to
take
up
her
own
cause
,
and
the
sincerity
of
her
*NL*
manner
being
soon
sufficient
to
convince
him
,
where
conviction
was
at
*NL*
least
very
agreeable
,
he
had
no
farther
scruples
as
to
her
being
left
*NL*
to
dine
alone
,
though
he
still
wanted
her
to
join
them
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
when
the
child
might
be
at
rest
for
the
night
,
and
kindly
urged
her
to
*NL*
let
him
come
and
fetch
her
,
but
she
was
quite
unpersuadable
;
and
this
*NL*
being
the
case
,
she
had
ere
long
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
set
off
*NL*
together
in
high
spirits
.
They
were
gone
,
she
hoped
,
to
be
happy
,
*NL*
however
oddly
constructed
such
happiness
might
seem
;
as
for
herself
,
*NL*
she
was
left
with
as
many
sensations
of
comfort
,
as
were
,
perhaps
,
ever
*NL*
likely
to
be
hers
.
She
knew
herself
to
be
of
the
first
utility
to
the
*NL*
child
;
and
what
was
it
to
her
if
Frederick
Wentworth
were
only
half
a
*NL*
mile
distant
,
making
himself
agreeable
to
others
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
have
liked
to
know
how
he
felt
as
to
a
meeting
.
Perhaps
*NL*
indifferent
,
if
indifference
could
exist
under
such
circumstances
.
He
*NL*
must
be
either
indifferent
or
unwilling
.
Had
he
wished
ever
to
see
her
*NL*
again
,
he
need
not
have
waited
till
this
time
;
he
would
have
done
what
*NL*
she
could
not
but
believe
that
in
his
place
she
should
have
done
long
*NL*
ago
,
when
events
had
been
early
giving
him
the
independence
which
alone
*NL*
had
been
wanting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
and
sister
came
back
delighted
with
their
new
acquaintance
,
*NL*
and
their
visit
in
general
.
There
had
been
music
,
singing
,
talking
,
*NL*
laughing
,
all
that
was
most
agreeable
;
charming
manners
in
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
,
no
shyness
or
reserve
;
they
seemed
all
to
know
each
other
*NL*
perfectly
,
and
he
was
coming
the
very
next
morning
to
shoot
with
*NL*
Charles
.
He
was
to
come
to
breakfast
,
but
not
at
the
Cottage
,
though
*NL*
that
had
been
proposed
at
first
;
but
then
he
had
been
pressed
to
come
*NL*
to
the
Great
House
instead
,
and
he
seemed
afraid
of
being
in
Mrs
*NL*
Charles
Musgrove
's
way
,
on
account
of
the
child
,
and
therefore
,
*NL*
somehow
,
they
hardly
knew
how
,
it
ended
in
Charles
's
being
to
meet
him
*NL*
to
breakfast
at
his
father
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
understood
it
.
He
wished
to
avoid
seeing
her
.
He
had
inquired
*NL*
after
her
,
she
found
,
slightly
,
as
might
suit
a
former
slight
*NL*
acquaintance
,
seeming
to
acknowledge
such
as
she
had
acknowledged
,
*NL*
actuated
,
perhaps
,
by
the
same
view
of
escaping
introduction
when
they
*NL*
were
to
meet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
hours
of
the
Cottage
were
always
later
than
those
of
the
*NL*
other
house
,
and
on
the
morrow
the
difference
was
so
great
that
Mary
*NL*
and
Anne
were
not
more
than
beginning
breakfast
when
Charles
came
in
to
*NL*
say
that
they
were
just
setting
off
,
that
he
was
come
for
his
dogs
,
*NL*
that
his
sisters
were
following
with
Captain
Wentworth
;
his
sisters
*NL*
meaning
to
visit
Mary
and
the
child
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
proposing
*NL*
also
to
wait
on
her
for
a
few
minutes
if
not
inconvenient
;
and
though
*NL*
Charles
had
answered
for
the
child
's
being
in
no
such
state
as
could
*NL*
make
it
inconvenient
,
Captain
Wentworth
would
not
be
satisfied
without
*NL*
his
running
on
to
give
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
,
very
much
gratified
by
this
attention
,
was
delighted
to
receive
*NL*
him
,
while
a
thousand
feelings
rushed
on
Anne
,
of
which
this
was
the
*NL*
most
consoling
,
that
it
would
soon
be
over
.
And
it
was
soon
over
.
In
*NL*
two
minutes
after
Charles
's
preparation
,
the
others
appeared
;
they
were
*NL*
in
the
drawing-room
.
Her
eye
half
met
Captain
Wentworth
's
,
a
bow
,
a
*NL*
curtsey
passed
;
she
heard
his
voice
;
he
talked
to
Mary
,
said
all
that
*NL*
was
right
,
said
something
to
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
enough
to
mark
an
easy
*NL*
footing
;
the
room
seemed
full
,
full
of
persons
and
voices
,
but
a
few
*NL*
minutes
ended
it
.
Charles
shewed
himself
at
the
window
,
all
was
ready
,
*NL*
their
visitor
had
bowed
and
was
gone
,
the
Miss
Musgroves
were
gone
too
,
*NL*
suddenly
resolving
to
walk
to
the
end
of
the
village
with
the
*NL*
sportsmen
:
the
room
was
cleared
,
and
Anne
might
finish
her
breakfast
*NL*
as
she
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
over
!
it
is
over
!
''
she
repeated
to
herself
again
and
again
,
in
*NL*
nervous
gratitude
.
``
The
worst
is
over
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
talked
,
but
she
could
not
attend
.
She
had
seen
him
.
They
had
*NL*
met
.
They
had
been
once
more
in
the
same
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
,
however
,
she
began
to
reason
with
herself
,
and
try
to
be
feeling
*NL*
less
.
Eight
years
,
almost
eight
years
had
passed
,
since
all
had
been
*NL*
given
up
.
How
absurd
to
be
resuming
the
agitation
which
such
an
*NL*
interval
had
banished
into
distance
and
indistinctness
!
What
might
not
*NL*
eight
years
do
?
Events
of
every
description
,
changes
,
alienations
,
*NL*
removals
--
all
,
all
must
be
comprised
in
it
,
and
oblivion
of
the
past
--
*NL*
how
natural
,
how
certain
too
!
It
included
nearly
a
third
part
of
her
*NL*
own
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
with
all
her
reasoning
,
she
found
,
that
to
retentive
feelings
*NL*
eight
years
may
be
little
more
than
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
how
were
his
sentiments
to
be
read
?
Was
this
like
wishing
to
*NL*
avoid
her
?
And
the
next
moment
she
was
hating
herself
for
the
folly
*NL*
which
asked
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
other
question
which
perhaps
her
utmost
wisdom
might
not
have
*NL*
prevented
,
she
was
soon
spared
all
suspense
;
for
,
after
the
Miss
*NL*
Musgroves
had
returned
and
finished
their
visit
at
the
Cottage
she
had
*NL*
this
spontaneous
information
from
Mary
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Wentworth
is
not
very
gallant
by
you
,
Anne
,
though
he
was
so
*NL*
attentive
to
me
.
Henrietta
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
you
,
when
they
*NL*
went
away
,
and
he
said
,
`
You
were
so
altered
he
should
not
have
known
*NL*
you
again
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
no
feelings
to
make
her
respect
her
sister
's
in
a
common
way
,
*NL*
but
she
was
perfectly
unsuspicious
of
being
inflicting
any
peculiar
*NL*
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Altered
beyond
his
knowledge
.
''
Anne
fully
submitted
,
in
silent
,
deep
*NL*
mortification
.
Doubtless
it
was
so
,
and
she
could
take
no
revenge
,
for
*NL*
he
was
not
altered
,
or
not
for
the
worse
.
She
had
already
acknowledged
*NL*
it
to
herself
,
and
she
could
not
think
differently
,
let
him
think
of
*NL*
her
as
he
would
.
No
:
the
years
which
had
destroyed
her
youth
and
*NL*
bloom
had
only
given
him
a
more
glowing
,
manly
,
open
look
,
in
no
*NL*
respect
lessening
his
personal
advantages
.
She
had
seen
the
same
*NL*
Frederick
Wentworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
altered
that
he
should
not
have
known
her
again
!
''
These
were
words
*NL*
which
could
not
but
dwell
with
her
.
Yet
she
soon
began
to
rejoice
that
*NL*
she
had
heard
them
.
They
were
of
sobering
tendency
;
they
allayed
*NL*
agitation
;
they
composed
,
and
consequently
must
make
her
happier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frederick
Wentworth
had
used
such
words
,
or
something
like
them
,
but
*NL*
without
an
idea
that
they
would
be
carried
round
to
her
.
He
had
*NL*
thought
her
wretchedly
altered
,
and
in
the
first
moment
of
appeal
,
had
*NL*
spoken
as
he
felt
.
He
had
not
forgiven
Anne
Elliot
.
She
had
used
him
*NL*
ill
,
deserted
and
disappointed
him
;
and
worse
,
she
had
shewn
a
*NL*
feebleness
of
character
in
doing
so
,
which
his
own
decided
,
confident
*NL*
temper
could
not
endure
.
She
had
given
him
up
to
oblige
others
.
It
*NL*
had
been
the
effect
of
over-persuasion
.
It
had
been
weakness
and
*NL*
timidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
most
warmly
attached
to
her
,
and
had
never
seen
a
woman
*NL*
since
whom
he
thought
her
equal
;
but
,
except
from
some
natural
*NL*
sensation
of
curiosity
,
he
had
no
desire
of
meeting
her
again
.
Her
*NL*
power
with
him
was
gone
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
his
object
to
marry
.
He
was
rich
,
and
being
turned
on
*NL*
shore
,
fully
intended
to
settle
as
soon
as
he
could
be
properly
*NL*
tempted
;
actually
looking
round
,
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
all
the
*NL*
speed
which
a
clear
head
and
a
quick
taste
could
allow
.
He
had
a
heart
*NL*
for
either
of
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
if
they
could
catch
it
;
a
heart
,
in
*NL*
short
,
for
any
pleasing
young
woman
who
came
in
his
way
,
excepting
Anne
*NL*
Elliot
.
This
was
his
only
secret
exception
,
when
he
said
to
his
*NL*
sister
,
in
answer
to
her
suppositions
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
here
I
am
,
Sophia
,
quite
ready
to
make
a
foolish
match
.
Anybody
*NL*
between
fifteen
and
thirty
may
have
me
for
asking
.
A
little
beauty
,
*NL*
and
a
few
smiles
,
and
a
few
compliments
to
the
navy
,
and
I
am
a
lost
*NL*
man
.
Should
not
this
be
enough
for
a
sailor
,
who
has
had
no
society
*NL*
among
women
to
make
him
nice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
,
she
knew
,
to
be
contradicted
.
His
bright
proud
eye
spoke
*NL*
the
conviction
that
he
was
nice
;
and
Anne
Elliot
was
not
out
of
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
when
he
more
seriously
described
the
woman
he
should
wish
to
*NL*
meet
with
.
``
A
strong
mind
,
with
sweetness
of
manner
,
''
made
the
first
*NL*
and
the
last
of
the
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
woman
I
want
,
''
said
he
.
``
Something
a
little
inferior
I
*NL*
shall
of
course
put
up
with
,
but
it
must
not
be
much
.
If
I
am
a
fool
,
*NL*
I
shall
be
a
fool
indeed
,
for
I
have
thought
on
the
subject
more
than
*NL*
most
men
.

Chapter
8
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
time
Captain
Wentworth
and
Anne
Elliot
were
repeatedly
in
the
*NL*
same
circle
.
They
were
soon
dining
in
company
together
at
Mr
*NL*
Musgrove
's
,
for
the
little
boy
's
state
could
no
longer
supply
his
aunt
*NL*
with
a
pretence
for
absenting
herself
;
and
this
was
but
the
beginning
*NL*
of
other
dinings
and
other
meetings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
former
feelings
were
to
be
renewed
must
be
brought
to
the
*NL*
proof
;
former
times
must
undoubtedly
be
brought
to
the
recollection
of
*NL*
each
;
they
could
not
but
be
reverted
to
;
the
year
of
their
engagement
*NL*
could
not
but
be
named
by
him
,
in
the
little
narratives
or
descriptions
*NL*
which
conversation
called
forth
.
His
profession
qualified
him
,
his
*NL*
disposition
lead
him
,
to
talk
;
and
``
That
was
in
the
year
six
;
''
``
That
*NL*
happened
before
I
went
to
sea
in
the
year
six
,
''
occurred
in
the
course
*NL*
of
the
first
evening
they
spent
together
:
and
though
his
voice
did
not
*NL*
falter
,
and
though
she
had
no
reason
to
suppose
his
eye
wandering
*NL*
towards
her
while
he
spoke
,
Anne
felt
the
utter
impossibility
,
from
her
*NL*
knowledge
of
his
mind
,
that
he
could
be
unvisited
by
remembrance
any
*NL*
more
than
herself
.
There
must
be
the
same
immediate
association
of
*NL*
thought
,
though
she
was
very
far
from
conceiving
it
to
be
of
equal
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
no
conversation
together
,
no
intercourse
but
what
the
*NL*
commonest
civility
required
.
Once
so
much
to
each
other
!
Now
nothing
!
*NL*
There
had
been
a
time
,
when
of
all
the
large
party
now
filling
the
*NL*
drawing-room
at
Uppercross
,
they
would
have
found
it
most
difficult
to
*NL*
cease
to
speak
to
one
another
.
With
the
exception
,
perhaps
,
of
Admiral
*NL*
and
Mrs
Croft
,
who
seemed
particularly
attached
and
happy
,
-LRB-
Anne
could
*NL*
allow
no
other
exceptions
even
among
the
married
couples
-RRB-
,
there
could
*NL*
have
been
no
two
hearts
so
open
,
no
tastes
so
similar
,
no
feelings
so
*NL*
in
unison
,
no
countenances
so
beloved
.
Now
they
were
as
strangers
;
*NL*
nay
,
worse
than
strangers
,
for
they
could
never
become
acquainted
.
It
*NL*
was
a
perpetual
estrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
talked
,
she
heard
the
same
voice
,
and
discerned
the
same
mind
.
*NL*
There
was
a
very
general
ignorance
of
all
naval
matters
throughout
the
*NL*
party
;
and
he
was
very
much
questioned
,
and
especially
by
the
two
Miss
*NL*
Musgroves
,
who
seemed
hardly
to
have
any
eyes
but
for
him
,
as
to
the
*NL*
manner
of
living
on
board
,
daily
regulations
,
food
,
hours
,
&
c.
,
and
*NL*
their
surprise
at
his
accounts
,
at
learning
the
degree
of
accommodation
*NL*
and
arrangement
which
was
practicable
,
drew
from
him
some
pleasant
*NL*
ridicule
,
which
reminded
Anne
of
the
early
days
when
she
too
had
been
*NL*
ignorant
,
and
she
too
had
been
accused
of
supposing
sailors
to
be
*NL*
living
on
board
without
anything
to
eat
,
or
any
cook
to
dress
it
if
*NL*
there
were
,
or
any
servant
to
wait
,
or
any
knife
and
fork
to
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
thus
listening
and
thinking
,
she
was
roused
by
a
whisper
of
Mrs
*NL*
Musgrove
's
who
,
overcome
by
fond
regrets
,
could
not
help
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Miss
Anne
,
if
it
had
pleased
Heaven
to
spare
my
poor
son
,
I
dare
*NL*
say
he
would
have
been
just
such
another
by
this
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
suppressed
a
smile
,
and
listened
kindly
,
while
Mrs
Musgrove
*NL*
relieved
her
heart
a
little
more
;
and
for
a
few
minutes
,
therefore
,
*NL*
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
conversation
of
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
could
let
her
attention
take
its
natural
course
again
,
she
*NL*
found
the
Miss
Musgroves
just
fetching
the
Navy
List
-LRB-
their
own
navy
*NL*
list
,
the
first
that
had
ever
been
at
Uppercross
-RRB-
,
and
sitting
down
*NL*
together
to
pore
over
it
,
with
the
professed
view
of
finding
out
the
*NL*
ships
that
Captain
Wentworth
had
commanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
first
was
the
Asp

I
remember
;
we
will
look
for
the
Asp

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
find
her
there

Quite
worn
out

broken
up

I
was
the

commanded
her

Hardly
fit
for

Reported
fit
*NL*
for

a
year

two

so
I
was
sent
off
to
the
West

*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
looked
all
amazement

continued
,

But
they
have
a
great
many

provide
for
;

among
the
thousands

may
just

go
to

*NL*

the

Captain

seriously

cried
Louisa

vexed
you

have
been

*NL*
*NL*

I

*NL*
at

Ah

she
was
a

*NL*
old
Asp
to
me

She
did
all
that
I
wanted

I
knew
she
would

I
knew
*NL*
that
we
should
either
go
to
the
bottom
together
,
or
that
she
would
be
*NL*
the
making
of
me
;
and
I
never
had
two
days
of
foul
weather
all
the
time
*NL*
I
was
at
sea

after
taking
privateers
enough

be
very

I
had
the
good
luck
in
my
passage
home
the
next
autumn

fall
in
with
the
very
French
frigate
I
wanted

I
brought
her
into
*NL*
Plymouth
;
and
here
another
instance
of
luck
.
We
had
not
been
six
hours
*NL*
in
the
Sound
,
when
a
gale
came
on
,
which
lasted
four
days
and
nights
,
*NL*
and
which
would
have
done
for
poor
old
Asp
in
half
the
time
;
our
touch
*NL*
with
the
Great
Nation
not
having
much
improved
our
condition
.
*NL*
Four-and-twenty
hours
later
,
and
I
should
only
have
been
a
gallant
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
a
small
paragraph
at
one
corner
of
the
*NL*
newspapers
;
and
being
lost
in
only
a
sloop
,
nobody
would
have
thought
*NL*
about

Anne
's
shudderings
were
to
herself
alone
;

the
Miss

Musgroves
could
be

open

they
were

aloud

need
not

it
would
be
rather
a
pleasure

talked

*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
being
somewhat
more
mindful
of
the
probabilities
of

*NL*
only
nodded
in

walked
away

*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
were
now
hunting
for
the
Laconia
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
could
*NL*
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
taking
the
precious
volume
into
his
*NL*
own
hands
to
save
them
the
trouble
,
and
once
more
read
aloud
the
little
*NL*
statement
of
her
name
and
rate
,
and
present
non-commissioned
class
,
*NL*
observing
over
it
that
she
too
had
been
one
of
the
best
friends

*NL*
ever
had

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
those
were
pleasant
days

How
fast
I
made

money

A
friend
of
mine

I
had
such
a
lovely
cruise
together
*NL*
off
the
Western
Islands

Poor

You
know
how
much

wanted
money

worse
than
myself

He
had
a
wife

Excellent
fellow

I
*NL*
shall
never
forget
his
happiness
.
He
felt
it
all
,
so
much
for
her
*NL*
sake
.
I
wished
for
him
again
the
next
summer
,
when
I
had
still
the
*NL*
same
luck
in
the
Mediterranean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
sure

Sir

said
Mrs

,
``

was
a

you
did

*NL*
*NL*
Her
feelings
made
her
speak
low
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
hearing
only
in
*NL*
part
,
and
probably
not
having
Dick
Musgrove
at
all
near
his
thoughts
,
*NL*
looked
rather
in
suspense
,
and
as
if
waiting
for
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother

whispered
one
of
the

;

mamma
is
thinking
of

*NL*
Richard

*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
dear
fellow

continued
Mrs
Musgrove
;
``

was
grown
so
steady
,
*NL*
and
such
an
excellent
correspondent

was
under

Ah
!
*NL*
it
would
have
been
a
happy
thing

if

never
left

I
assure

you

we
are
very
sorry

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
momentary
expression
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
face
at
this
*NL*
speech
,
a
certain
glance
of
his
bright
eye
,
and
curl
of
his
handsome
*NL*
mouth
,
which
convinced
Anne
,
that
instead
of
sharing
in
Mrs
Musgrove
's
*NL*
kind
wishes
,
as
to
her
son
,
he
had
probably
been
at
some
pains
to
get
*NL*
rid
of
him
;
but
it
was
too
transient
an
indulgence
of
self-amusement
to
*NL*
be
detected
by
any
who
understood
him
less
than
herself
;
in
another
*NL*
moment
he
was
perfectly
collected
and
serious
,
and
almost
instantly
*NL*
afterwards
coming
up
to
the
sofa
,
on
which
she
and
Mrs
Musgrove
were
*NL*
sitting
,
took
a
place
by
the
latter
,
and
entered
into
conversation
with
*NL*
her
,
in
a
low
voice
,
about
her
son
,
doing
it
with
so
much
sympathy
and
*NL*
natural
grace
,
as
shewed
the
kindest
consideration
for
all
that
was
*NL*
real
and
unabsurd
in
the
parent
's
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
actually
on
the
same
sofa
,
for
Mrs
Musgrove
had
most
readily
*NL*
made
room
for
him
;
they
were
divided
only
by
Mrs
Musgrove
.
It
was
no
*NL*
insignificant
barrier
,
indeed
.
Mrs
Musgrove
was
of
a
comfortable
,
*NL*
substantial
size
,
infinitely
more
fitted
by
nature
to
express
good
*NL*
cheer
and
good
humour
,
than
tenderness
and
sentiment
;
and
while
the
*NL*
agitations
of
Anne
's
slender
form
,
and
pensive
face
,
may
be
considered
*NL*
as
very
completely
screened
,
Captain
Wentworth
should
be
allowed
some
*NL*
credit
for
the
self-command
with
which
he
attended
to
her
large
fat
*NL*
sighings
over
the
destiny
of
a
son
,
whom
alive
nobody
had
cared
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Personal
size
and
mental
sorrow
have
certainly
no
necessary
*NL*
proportions
.
A
large
bulky
figure
has
as
good
a
right
to
be
in
deep
*NL*
affliction
,
as
the
most
graceful
set
of
limbs
in
the
world
.
But
,
fair
*NL*
or
not
fair
,
there
are
unbecoming
conjunctions
,
which
reason
will
*NL*
patronize
in
vain
--
which
taste
can
not
tolerate
--
which
ridicule
will
*NL*
seize
.

The
Admiral
,
after
taking
two
or
three
refreshing
turns
about
the
room
*NL*
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
being
called
to
order
by
his
wife
,
now
came
*NL*
up
to
Captain
Wentworth
,
and
without
any
observation
of
what
he
might
*NL*
be
interrupting
,
thinking
only
of
his
own
thoughts
,
began
with
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
been
a
week
later

Lisbon

*NL*
``
Should

I
am
glad

was
not

*NL*
The
Admiral
abused
him
for
his
want
of
gallantry
.
He
defended
himself
;
*NL*
though
professing
that
he
would
never
willingly
admit
any
ladies
on
*NL*
board
a
ship
of
his
,
excepting
for
a
ball
,
or
a
visit
,
which
a
few
*NL*
hours
might
comprehend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
if
I
know
myself
,
''
said
he
,
``
this
is
from
no
want
of
gallantry

towards
them

It
is
rather
from
feeling
how
impossible

with
all

efforts

and
all
one
's
sacrifices
,
to
make
the
accommodations
on

board
such
as

ought

have

There
can
be
no

gallantry

in
rating
the
claims
of
women
to
every
personal
comfort
high

this
is
what
I
do

I
hate
to
hear

them

no

My

often
want
to

My

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
hate
to
hear
you
talking

Ah

said
the
Admiral

Captain

Yes

there
is
an
end

it

*NL*
He
got
up
and
moved
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
great
traveller
you
must
have
been

said
Mrs

*NL*
to
Mrs
Croft

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
well
,
ma'am
in
the
fifteen
years
of
my
marriage
;
though
many
*NL*
women
have
done
more

I
have
crossed
the
Atlantic
four
times

have

been
once
to
the
East
Indies

back
again

besides

being
in
different
places
about

Cork

Gibraltar

*NL*
But
I
never
went
beyond
the
Streights

and
never
was
in

West

We
do
not
call
Bermuda
or
Bahama

you
know
,
the
West
Indies

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Musgrove
had
not
a
word
to
say
in
dissent
;
she
could
not
accuse
*NL*
herself
of
having
ever
called
them
anything
in
the
whole
course
of
her
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
do
assure
you
,
ma'am
,
''
pursued
Mrs
Croft
,
``
that
nothing
can
*NL*
exceed
the
accommodations
of
a
man-of-war
;
I
speak
,
you
know
,
of
the
*NL*
higher
rates
.
When
you
come
to
a
frigate
,
of
course
,
you
are
more
*NL*
confined
;
though
any
reasonable
woman
may
be
perfectly
happy
in
one
of
*NL*
them
;
and
I
can
safely
say
,
that
the
happiest
part
of
my
life
has
been
*NL*
spent
on
board
a
ship
.
While
we
were
together
,
you
know
,
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
be
feared
.
Thank
God
!
I
have
always
been
blessed
with
*NL*
excellent
health
,
and
no
climate
disagrees
with
me
.
A
little
*NL*
disordered
always
the
first
twenty-four
hours
of
going
to
sea
,
but
*NL*
never
knew
what
sickness
was
afterwards
.
The
only
time
I
ever
really
*NL*
suffered
in
body
or
mind
,
the
only
time
that
I
ever
fancied
myself
*NL*
unwell
,
or
had
any
ideas
of
danger
,
was
the
winter
that
I
passed
by
*NL*
myself
at
Deal
,
when
the
Admiral
-LRB-
Captain
Croft
then
-RRB-
was
in
the
North
*NL*
Seas
.
I
lived
in
perpetual
fright
at
that
time
,
and
had
all
manner
of
*NL*
imaginary
complaints
from
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
myself
,
or
when
I
*NL*
should
hear
from
him
next
;
but
as
long
as
we
could
be
together
,
nothing
*NL*
ever
ailed
me
,
and
I
never
met
with
the
smallest
inconvenience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
to
be
sure
.
Yes
,
indeed
,
oh
yes
!
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
,
*NL*
Mrs
Croft
,
''
was
Mrs
Musgrove
's
hearty
answer
.
``
There
is
nothing
so
bad
*NL*
as
a
separation
.
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
.
I
know
what
it
is
,
for
*NL*
Mr
Musgrove
always
attends
the
assizes
,
and
I
am
so
glad
when
they
are
*NL*
over
,
and
he
is
safe
back
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
ended
with
dancing
.
On
its
being
proposed
,
Anne
offered
*NL*
her
services
,
as
usual
;
and
though
her
eyes
would
sometimes
fill
with
*NL*
tears
as
she
sat
at
the
instrument
,
she
was
extremely
glad
to
be
*NL*
employed
,
and
desired
nothing
in
return
but
to
be
unobserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
merry
,
joyous
party
,
and
no
one
seemed
in
higher
spirits
than
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
.
She
felt
that
he
had
every
thing
to
elevate
him
*NL*
which
general
attention
and
deference
,
and
especially
the
attention
of
*NL*
all
the
young
women
,
could
do
.
The
Miss
Hayters
,
the
females
of
the
*NL*
family
of
cousins
already
mentioned
,
were
apparently
admitted
to
the
*NL*
honour
of
being
in
love
with
him
;
and
as
for
Henrietta
and
Louisa
,
they
*NL*
both
seemed
so
entirely
occupied
by
him
,
that
nothing
but
the
continued
*NL*
appearance
of
the
most
perfect
good-will
between
themselves
could
have
*NL*
made
it
credible
that
they
were
not
decided
rivals
.
If
he
were
a
*NL*
little
spoilt
by
such
universal
,
such
eager
admiration
,
who
could
*NL*
wonder
?
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
some
of
the
thoughts
which
occupied
Anne
,
while
her
fingers
*NL*
were
mechanically
at
work
,
proceeding
for
half
an
hour
together
,
*NL*
equally
without
error
,
and
without
consciousness
.
Once
she
felt
that
*NL*
he
was
looking
at
herself
,
observing
her
altered
features
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
trying
to
trace
in
them
the
ruins
of
the
face
which
had
once
charmed
*NL*
him
;
and
once
she
knew
that
he
must
have
spoken
of
her
;
she
was
hardly
*NL*
aware
of
it
,
till
she
heard
the
answer
;
but
then
she
was
sure
of
his
*NL*
having
asked
his
partner
whether
Miss
Elliot
never
danced
?
The
answer
*NL*
was
,
``
Oh
,
no
;
never
;
she
has
quite
given
up
dancing
.
She
had
rather
*NL*
play
.
She
is
never
tired
of
playing
.
''
Once
,
too
,
he
spoke
to
her
.
*NL*
She
had
left
the
instrument
on
the
dancing
being
over
,
and
he
had
sat
*NL*
down
to
try
to
make
out
an
air
which
he
wished
to
give
the
Miss
*NL*
Musgroves
an
idea
of
.
Unintentionally
she
returned
to
that
part
of
the
*NL*
room
;
he
saw
her
,
and
,
instantly
rising
,
said
,
with
studied
politeness
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
madam
,
this
is
your
seat
;
''
and
though
she
*NL*
immediately
drew
back
with
a
decided
negative
,
he
was
not
to
be
induced
*NL*
to
sit
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
did
not
wish
for
more
of
such
looks
and
speeches
.
His
cold
*NL*
politeness
,
his
ceremonious
grace
,
were
worse
than
anything
.

Chapter
9
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
was
come
to
Kellynch
as
to
a
home
,
to
stay
as
long
as
*NL*
he
liked
,
being
as
thoroughly
the
object
of
the
Admiral
's
fraternal
*NL*
kindness
as
of
his
wife
's
.
He
had
intended
,
on
first
arriving
,
to
*NL*
proceed
very
soon
into
Shropshire
,
and
visit
the
brother
settled
in
*NL*
that
country
,
but
the
attractions
of
Uppercross
induced
him
to
put
this
*NL*
off
.
There
was
so
much
of
friendliness
,
and
of
flattery
,
and
of
*NL*
everything
most
bewitching
in
his
reception
there
;
the
old
were
so
*NL*
hospitable
,
the
young
so
agreeable
,
that
he
could
not
but
resolve
to
*NL*
remain
where
he
was
,
and
take
all
the
charms
and
perfections
of
*NL*
Edward
's
wife
upon
credit
a
little
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
soon
Uppercross
with
him
almost
every
day
.
The
Musgroves
could
*NL*
hardly
be
more
ready
to
invite
than
he
to
come
,
particularly
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
when
he
had
no
companion
at
home
,
for
the
Admiral
and
Mrs
*NL*
Croft
were
generally
out
of
doors
together
,
interesting
themselves
in
*NL*
their
new
possessions
,
their
grass
,
and
their
sheep
,
and
dawdling
about
*NL*
in
a
way
not
endurable
to
a
third
person
,
or
driving
out
in
a
gig
,
*NL*
lately
added
to
their
establishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hitherto
there
had
been
but
one
opinion
of
Captain
Wentworth
among
the
*NL*
Musgroves
and
their
dependencies
.
It
was
unvarying
,
warm
admiration
*NL*
everywhere
;
but
this
intimate
footing
was
not
more
than
established
,
*NL*
when
a
certain
Charles
Hayter
returned
among
them
,
to
be
a
good
deal
*NL*
disturbed
by
it
,
and
to
think
Captain
Wentworth
very
much
in
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
Hayter
was
the
eldest
of
all
the
cousins
,
and
a
very
amiable
,
*NL*
pleasing
young
man
,
between
whom
and
Henrietta
there
had
been
a
*NL*
considerable
appearance
of
attachment
previous
to
Captain
Wentworth
's
*NL*
introduction
.
He
was
in
orders
;
and
having
a
curacy
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
where
residence
was
not
required
,
lived
at
his
father
's
*NL*
house
,
only
two
miles
from
Uppercross
.
A
short
absence
from
home
had
*NL*
left
his
fair
one
unguarded
by
his
attentions
at
this
critical
period
,
*NL*
and
when
he
came
back
he
had
the
pain
of
finding
very
altered
manners
,
*NL*
and
of
seeing
Captain
Wentworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Musgrove
and
Mrs
Hayter
were
sisters
.
They
had
each
had
money
,
but
*NL*
their
marriages
had
made
a
material
difference
in
their
degree
of
*NL*
consequence
.
Mr
Hayter
had
some
property
of
his
own
,
but
it
was
*NL*
insignificant
compared
with
Mr
Musgrove
's
;
and
while
the
Musgroves
were
*NL*
in
the
first
class
of
society
in
the
country
,
the
young
Hayters
would
,
*NL*
from
their
parents
'
inferior
,
retired
,
and
unpolished
way
of
living
,
*NL*
and
their
own
defective
education
,
have
been
hardly
in
any
class
at
*NL*
all
,
but
for
their
connexion
with
Uppercross
,
this
eldest
son
of
course
*NL*
excepted
,
who
had
chosen
to
be
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
,
and
who
was
*NL*
very
superior
in
cultivation
and
manners
to
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
families
had
always
been
on
excellent
terms
,
there
being
no
*NL*
pride
on
one
side
,
and
no
envy
on
the
other
,
and
only
such
a
*NL*
consciousness
of
superiority
in
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
as
made
them
*NL*
pleased
to
improve
their
cousins
.
Charles
's
attentions
to
Henrietta
*NL*
had
been
observed
by
her
father
and
mother
without
any
disapprobation
.
*NL*
``
It
would
not
be
a
great
match
for
her
;
but
if
Henrietta
liked
him
,
''
--
*NL*
and
Henrietta
did
seem
to
like
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
fully
thought
so
herself
,
before
Captain
Wentworth
came
;
but
*NL*
from
that
time
Cousin
Charles
had
been
very
much
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
of
the
two
sisters
was
preferred
by
Captain
Wentworth
was
as
yet
*NL*
quite
doubtful
,
as
far
as
Anne
's
observation
reached
.
Henrietta
was
*NL*
perhaps
the
prettiest
,
Louisa
had
the
higher
spirits
;
and
she
knew
not
*NL*
now
,
whether
the
more
gentle
or
the
more
lively
character
were
most
*NL*
likely
to
attract
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
,
either
from
seeing
little
,
or
from
an
entire
*NL*
confidence
in
the
discretion
of
both
their
daughters
,
and
of
all
the
*NL*
young
men
who
came
near
them
,
seemed
to
leave
everything
to
take
its
*NL*
chance
.
There
was
not
the
smallest
appearance
of
solicitude
or
remark
*NL*
about
them
in
the
Mansion-house
;
but
it
was
different
at
the
Cottage
:
*NL*
the
young
couple
there
were
more
disposed
to
speculate
and
wonder
;
and
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
had
not
been
above
four
or
five
times
in
the
Miss
*NL*
Musgroves
'
company
,
and
Charles
Hayter
had
but
just
reappeared
,
when
*NL*
Anne
had
to
listen
to
the
opinions
of
her
brother
and
sister
,
as
to
*NL*
which
was
the
one
liked
best
.
Charles
gave
it
for
Louisa
,
Mary
for
*NL*
Henrietta
,
but
quite
agreeing
that
to
have
him
marry
either
could
be
*NL*
extremely
delightful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
``
had
never
seen
a
pleasanter
man
in
his
life
;
and
from
what
he
*NL*
had
once
heard
Captain
Wentworth
himself
say
,
was
very
sure
that
he
had
*NL*
not
made
less
than
twenty
thousand
pounds
by
the
war
.
Here
was
a
*NL*
fortune
at
once
;
besides
which
,
there
would
be
the
chance
of
what
might
*NL*
be
done
in
any
future
war
;
and
he
was
sure
Captain
Wentworth
was
as
*NL*
likely
a
man
to
distinguish
himself
as
any
officer
in
the
navy
.
Oh
!
it
*NL*
would
be
a
capital
match
for
either
of
his
sisters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
it
would
,
''
replied
Mary
.
``
Dear
me
!
If
he
should
rise
to
*NL*
any
very
great
honours
!
If
he
should
ever
be
made
a
baronet
!
`
Lady
*NL*
Wentworth
'
sounds
very
well
.
That
would
be
a
noble
thing
,
indeed
,
for
*NL*
Henrietta
!
She
would
take
place
of
me
then
,
and
Henrietta
would
not
*NL*
dislike
that
.
Sir
Frederick
and
Lady
Wentworth
!
It
would
be
but
a
new
*NL*
creation
,
however
,
and
I
never
think
much
of
your
new
creations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
suited
Mary
best
to
think
Henrietta
the
one
preferred
on
the
very
*NL*
account
of
Charles
Hayter
,
whose
pretensions
she
wished
to
see
put
an
*NL*
end
to
.
She
looked
down
very
decidedly
upon
the
Hayters
,
and
thought
*NL*
it
would
be
quite
a
misfortune
to
have
the
existing
connection
between
*NL*
the
families
renewed
--
very
sad
for
herself
and
her
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
can
not
think
him
at
all
a
fit
match
for
*NL*
Henrietta
;
and
considering
the
alliances
which
the
Musgroves
have
made
,
*NL*
she
has
no
right
to
throw
herself
away
.
I
do
not
think
any
young
woman
*NL*
has
a
right
to
make
a
choice
that
may
be
disagreeable
and
inconvenient
*NL*
to
the
principal
part
of
her
family
,
and
be
giving
bad
connections
to
*NL*
those
who
have
not
been
used
to
them
.
And
,
pray
,
who
is
Charles
*NL*
Hayter
?
Nothing
but
a
country
curate
.
A
most
improper
match
for
Miss
*NL*
Musgrove
of
Uppercross
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
,
however
,
would
not
agree
with
her
here
;
for
besides
having
*NL*
a
regard
for
his
cousin
,
Charles
Hayter
was
an
eldest
son
,
and
he
saw
*NL*
things
as
an
eldest
son
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
are
talking
nonsense
,
Mary
,
''
was
therefore
his
answer
.
``
It
*NL*
would
not
be
a
great
match
for
Henrietta
,
but
Charles
has
a
very
fair
*NL*
chance
,
through
the
Spicers
,
of
getting
something
from
the
Bishop
in
*NL*
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
;
and
you
will
please
to
remember
,
that
he
*NL*
is
the
eldest
son
;
whenever
my
uncle
dies
,
he
steps
into
very
pretty
*NL*
property
.
The
estate
at
Winthrop
is
not
less
than
two
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
acres
,
besides
the
farm
near
Taunton
,
which
is
some
of
the
best
*NL*
land
in
the
country
.
I
grant
you
,
that
any
of
them
but
Charles
would
*NL*
be
a
very
shocking
match
for
Henrietta
,
and
indeed
it
could
not
be
;
he
*NL*
is
the
only
one
that
could
be
possible
;
but
he
is
a
very
good-natured
,
*NL*
good
sort
of
a
fellow
;
and
whenever
Winthrop
comes
into
his
hands
,
he
*NL*
will
make
a
different
sort
of
place
of
it
,
and
live
in
a
very
different
*NL*
sort
of
way
;
and
with
that
property
,
he
will
never
be
a
contemptible
*NL*
man
--
good
,
freehold
property
.
No
,
no
;
Henrietta
might
do
worse
than
*NL*
marry
Charles
Hayter
;
and
if
she
has
him
,
and
Louisa
can
get
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
,
I
shall
be
very
well
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charles
may
say
what
he
pleases
,
''
cried
Mary
to
Anne
,
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
was
out
of
the
room
,
``
but
it
would
be
shocking
to
have
Henrietta
marry
*NL*
Charles
Hayter
;
a
very
bad
thing
for
her
,
and
still
worse
for
me
;
and
*NL*
therefore
it
is
very
much
to
be
wished
that
Captain
Wentworth
may
soon
*NL*
put
him
quite
out
of
her
head
,
and
I
have
very
little
doubt
that
he
*NL*
has
.
She
took
hardly
any
notice
of
Charles
Hayter
yesterday
.
I
wish
*NL*
you
had
been
there
to
see
her
behaviour
.
And
as
to
Captain
Wentworth
's
*NL*
liking
Louisa
as
well
as
Henrietta
,
it
is
nonsense
to
say
so
;
for
he
*NL*
certainly
does
like
Henrietta
a
great
deal
the
best
.
But
Charles
is
so
*NL*
positive
!
I
wish
you
had
been
with
us
yesterday
,
for
then
you
might
*NL*
have
decided
between
us
;
and
I
am
sure
you
would
have
thought
as
I
did
,
*NL*
unless
you
had
been
determined
to
give
it
against
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
dinner
at
Mr
Musgrove
's
had
been
the
occasion
when
all
these
things
*NL*
should
have
been
seen
by
Anne
;
but
she
had
staid
at
home
,
under
the
*NL*
mixed
plea
of
a
headache
of
her
own
,
and
some
return
of
indisposition
*NL*
in
little
Charles
.
She
had
thought
only
of
avoiding
Captain
Wentworth
;
*NL*
but
an
escape
from
being
appealed
to
as
umpire
was
now
added
to
the
*NL*
advantages
of
a
quiet
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Captain
Wentworth
's
views
,
she
deemed
it
of
more
consequence
that
*NL*
he
should
know
his
own
mind
early
enough
not
to
be
endangering
the
*NL*
happiness
of
either
sister
,
or
impeaching
his
own
honour
,
than
that
he
*NL*
should
prefer
Henrietta
to
Louisa
,
or
Louisa
to
Henrietta
.
Either
of
*NL*
them
would
,
in
all
probability
,
make
him
an
affectionate
,
good-humoured
*NL*
wife
.
With
regard
to
Charles
Hayter
,
she
had
delicacy
which
must
be
*NL*
pained
by
any
lightness
of
conduct
in
a
well-meaning
young
woman
,
and
a
*NL*
heart
to
sympathize
in
any
of
the
sufferings
it
occasioned
;
but
if
*NL*
Henrietta
found
herself
mistaken
in
the
nature
of
her
feelings
,
the
*NL*
alteration
could
not
be
understood
too
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
Hayter
had
met
with
much
to
disquiet
and
mortify
him
in
his
*NL*
cousin
's
behaviour
.
She
had
too
old
a
regard
for
him
to
be
so
wholly
*NL*
estranged
as
might
in
two
meetings
extinguish
every
past
hope
,
and
*NL*
leave
him
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
away
from
Uppercross
:
but
there
*NL*
was
such
a
change
as
became
very
alarming
,
when
such
a
man
as
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
was
to
be
regarded
as
the
probable
cause
.
He
had
been
absent
*NL*
only
two
Sundays
,
and
when
they
parted
,
had
left
her
interested
,
even
*NL*
to
the
height
of
his
wishes
,
in
his
prospect
of
soon
quitting
his
*NL*
present
curacy
,
and
obtaining
that
of
Uppercross
instead
.
It
had
then
*NL*
seemed
the
object
nearest
her
heart
,
that
Dr
Shirley
,
the
rector
,
who
*NL*
for
more
than
forty
years
had
been
zealously
discharging
all
the
duties
*NL*
of
his
office
,
but
was
now
growing
too
infirm
for
many
of
them
,
should
*NL*
be
quite
fixed
on
engaging
a
curate
;
should
make
his
curacy
quite
as
*NL*
good
as
he
could
afford
,
and
should
give
Charles
Hayter
the
promise
of
*NL*
it
.
The
advantage
of
his
having
to
come
only
to
Uppercross
,
instead
of
*NL*
going
six
miles
another
way
;
of
his
having
,
in
every
respect
,
a
better
*NL*
curacy
;
of
his
belonging
to
their
dear
Dr
Shirley
,
and
of
dear
,
good
Dr
*NL*
Shirley
's
being
relieved
from
the
duty
which
he
could
no
longer
get
*NL*
through
without
most
injurious
fatigue
,
had
been
a
great
deal
,
even
to
*NL*
Louisa
,
but
had
been
almost
everything
to
Henrietta
.
When
he
came
*NL*
back
,
alas
!
the
zeal
of
the
business
was
gone
by
.
Louisa
could
not
*NL*
listen
at
all
to
his
account
of
a
conversation
which
he
had
just
held
*NL*
with
Dr
Shirley
:
she
was
at
a
window
,
looking
out
for
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
;
and
even
Henrietta
had
at
best
only
a
divided
attention
to
*NL*
give
,
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
the
former
doubt
and
solicitude
*NL*
of
the
negotiation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
very
glad
indeed
:
but
I
always
thought
you
would
have
it
;
*NL*
I
always
thought
you
sure
.
It
did
not
appear
to
me
that
--
in
short
,
you
*NL*
know
,
Dr
Shirley
must
have
a
curate
,
and
you
had
secured
his
promise
.
*NL*
Is
he
coming
,
Louisa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
very
soon
after
the
dinner
at
the
Musgroves
,
at
which
Anne
*NL*
had
not
been
present
,
Captain
Wentworth
walked
into
the
drawing-room
at
*NL*
the
Cottage
,
where
were
only
herself
and
the
little
invalid
Charles
,
*NL*
who
was
lying
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
surprise
of
finding
himself
almost
alone
with
Anne
Elliot
,
deprived
*NL*
his
manners
of
their
usual
composure
:
he
started
,
and
could
only
say
,
*NL*
``
I
thought
the
Miss
Musgroves
had
been
here
:
Mrs
Musgrove
told
me
I
*NL*
should
find
them
here
,
''
before
he
walked
to
the
window
to
recollect
*NL*
himself
,
and
feel
how
he
ought
to
behave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
up
stairs
with
my
sister
:
they
will
be
down
in
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
I
dare
say
,
''
had
been
Anne
's
reply
,
in
all
the
confusion
that
*NL*
was
natural
;
and
if
the
child
had
not
called
her
to
come
and
do
*NL*
something
for
him
,
she
would
have
been
out
of
the
room
the
next
moment
,
*NL*
and
released
Captain
Wentworth
as
well
as
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
at
the
window
;
and
after
calmly
and
politely
saying
,
``
I
*NL*
hope
the
little
boy
is
better
,
''
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
obliged
to
kneel
down
by
the
sofa
,
and
remain
there
to
satisfy
*NL*
her
patient
;
and
thus
they
continued
a
few
minutes
,
when
,
to
her
very
*NL*
great
satisfaction
,
she
heard
some
other
person
crossing
the
little
*NL*
vestibule
.
She
hoped
,
on
turning
her
head
,
to
see
the
master
of
the
*NL*
house
;
but
it
proved
to
be
one
much
less
calculated
for
making
matters
*NL*
easy
--
Charles
Hayter
,
probably
not
at
all
better
pleased
by
the
sight
*NL*
of
Captain
Wentworth
than
Captain
Wentworth
had
been
by
the
sight
of
*NL*
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
only
attempted
to
say
,
``
How
do
you
do
?
Will
you
not
sit
down
?
The
*NL*
others
will
be
here
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
,
however
,
came
from
his
window
,
apparently
not
*NL*
ill-disposed
for
conversation
;
but
Charles
Hayter
soon
put
an
end
to
*NL*
his
attempts
by
seating
himself
near
the
table
,
and
taking
up
the
*NL*
newspaper
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
returned
to
his
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
minute
brought
another
addition
.
The
younger
boy
,
a
remarkable
*NL*
stout
,
forward
child
,
of
two
years
old
,
having
got
the
door
opened
for
*NL*
him
by
some
one
without
,
made
his
determined
appearance
among
them
,
and
*NL*
went
straight
to
the
sofa
to
see
what
was
going
on
,
and
put
in
his
*NL*
claim
to
anything
good
that
might
be
giving
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
being
nothing
to
eat
,
he
could
only
have
some
play
;
and
as
his
*NL*
aunt
would
not
let
him
tease
his
sick
brother
,
he
began
to
fasten
*NL*
himself
upon
her
,
as
she
knelt
,
in
such
a
way
that
,
busy
as
she
was
*NL*
about
Charles
,
she
could
not
shake
him
off
.
She
spoke
to
him
,
ordered
,
*NL*
entreated
,
and
insisted
in
vain
.
Once
she
did
contrive
to
push
him
*NL*
away
,
but
the
boy
had
the
greater
pleasure
in
getting
upon
her
back
*NL*
again
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walter
,
''
said
she
,
``
get
down
this
moment
.
You
are
extremely
*NL*
troublesome
.
I
am
very
angry
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walter
,
''
cried
Charles
Hayter
,
``
why
do
you
not
do
as
you
are
bid
?
Do
*NL*
not
you
hear
your
aunt
speak
?
Come
to
me
,
Walter
,
come
to
cousin
*NL*
Charles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
a
bit
did
Walter
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
moment
,
however
,
she
found
herself
in
the
state
of
being
*NL*
released
from
him
;
some
one
was
taking
him
from
her
,
though
he
had
bent
*NL*
down
her
head
so
much
,
that
his
little
sturdy
hands
were
unfastened
*NL*
from
around
her
neck
,
and
he
was
resolutely
borne
away
,
before
she
knew
*NL*
that
Captain
Wentworth
had
done
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
sensations
on
the
discovery
made
her
perfectly
speechless
.
She
*NL*
could
not
even
thank
him
.
She
could
only
hang
over
little
Charles
,
*NL*
with
most
disordered
feelings
.
His
kindness
in
stepping
forward
to
her
*NL*
relief
,
the
manner
,
the
silence
in
which
it
had
passed
,
the
little
*NL*
particulars
of
the
circumstance
,
with
the
conviction
soon
forced
on
her
*NL*
by
the
noise
he
was
studiously
making
with
the
child
,
that
he
meant
to
*NL*
avoid
hearing
her
thanks
,
and
rather
sought
to
testify
that
her
*NL*
conversation
was
the
last
of
his
wants
,
produced
such
a
confusion
of
*NL*
varying
,
but
very
painful
agitation
,
as
she
could
not
recover
from
,
*NL*
till
enabled
by
the
entrance
of
Mary
and
the
Miss
Musgroves
to
make
*NL*
over
her
little
patient
to
their
cares
,
and
leave
the
room
.
She
could
*NL*
not
stay
.
It
might
have
been
an
opportunity
of
watching
the
loves
and
*NL*
jealousies
of
the
four
--
they
were
now
altogether
;
but
she
could
stay
*NL*
for
none
of
it
.
It
was
evident
that
Charles
Hayter
was
not
well
*NL*
inclined
towards
Captain
Wentworth
.
She
had
a
strong
impression
of
his
*NL*
having
said
,
in
a
vext
tone
of
voice
,
after
Captain
Wentworth
's
*NL*
interference
,
``
You
ought
to
have
minded
me
,
Walter
;
I
told
you
not
to
*NL*
teaze
your
aunt
;
''
and
could
comprehend
his
regretting
that
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
should
do
what
he
ought
to
have
done
himself
.
But
neither
*NL*
Charles
Hayter
's
feelings
,
nor
anybody
's
feelings
,
could
interest
her
,
*NL*
till
she
had
a
little
better
arranged
her
own
.
She
was
ashamed
of
*NL*
herself
,
quite
ashamed
of
being
so
nervous
,
so
overcome
by
such
a
*NL*
trifle
;
but
so
it
was
,
and
it
required
a
long
application
of
solitude
*NL*
and
reflection
to
recover
her
.

*NL*
Other
opportunities
of
making
her
observations
could
not
fail
to
occur
.
*NL*
Anne
had
soon
been
in
company
with
all
the
four
together
often
enough
*NL*
to
have
an
opinion
,
though
too
wise
to
acknowledge
as
much
at
home
,
*NL*
where
she
knew
it
would
have
satisfied
neither
husband
nor
wife
;
for
*NL*
while
she
considered
Louisa
to
be
rather
the
favourite
,
she
could
not
*NL*
but
think
,
as
far
as
she
might
dare
to
judge
from
memory
and
*NL*
experience
,
that
Captain
Wentworth
was
not
in
love
with
either
.
They
*NL*
were
more
in
love
with
him
;
yet
there
it
was
not
love
.
It
was
a
little
*NL*
fever
of
admiration
;
but
it
might
,
probably
must
,
end
in
love
with
*NL*
some
.
Charles
Hayter
seemed
aware
of
being
slighted
,
and
yet
Henrietta
*NL*
had
sometimes
the
air
of
being
divided
between
them
.
Anne
longed
for
*NL*
the
power
of
representing
to
them
all
what
they
were
about
,
and
of
*NL*
pointing
out
some
of
the
evils
they
were
exposing
themselves
to
.
She
*NL*
did
not
attribute
guile
to
any
.
It
was
the
highest
satisfaction
to
her
*NL*
to
believe
Captain
Wentworth
not
in
the
least
aware
of
the
pain
he
was
*NL*
occasioning
.
There
was
no
triumph
,
no
pitiful
triumph
in
his
manner
.
*NL*
He
had
,
probably
,
never
heard
,
and
never
thought
of
any
claims
of
*NL*
Charles
Hayter
.
He
was
only
wrong
in
accepting
the
attentions
-LRB-
for
*NL*
accepting
must
be
the
word
-RRB-
of
two
young
women
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
struggle
,
however
,
Charles
Hayter
seemed
to
quit
the
*NL*
field
.
Three
days
had
passed
without
his
coming
once
to
Uppercross
;
a
*NL*
most
decided
change
.
He
had
even
refused
one
regular
invitation
to
*NL*
dinner
;
and
having
been
found
on
the
occasion
by
Mr
Musgrove
with
some
*NL*
large
books
before
him
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
were
sure
all
could
not
be
*NL*
right
,
and
talked
,
with
grave
faces
,
of
his
studying
himself
to
death
.
*NL*
It
was
Mary
's
hope
and
belief
that
he
had
received
a
positive
dismissal
*NL*
from
Henrietta
,
and
her
husband
lived
under
the
constant
dependence
of
*NL*
seeing
him
to-morrow
.
Anne
could
only
feel
that
Charles
Hayter
was
*NL*
wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
about
this
time
Charles
Musgrove
and
Captain
Wentworth
*NL*
being
gone
a-shooting
together
,
as
the
sisters
in
the
Cottage
were
*NL*
sitting
quietly
at
work
,
they
were
visited
at
the
window
by
the
sisters
*NL*
from
the
Mansion-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
fine
November
day
,
and
the
Miss
Musgroves
came
through
*NL*
the
little
grounds
,
and
stopped
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
say
,
that
*NL*
they
were
going
to
take
a
long
walk
,
and
therefore
concluded
Mary
could
*NL*
not
like
to
go
with
them
;
and
when
Mary
immediately
replied
,
with
some
*NL*
jealousy
at
not
being
supposed
a
good
walker
,
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
should
like
*NL*
to
join
you
very
much
,
I
am
very
fond
of
a
long
walk
;
''
Anne
felt
*NL*
persuaded
,
by
the
looks
of
the
two
girls
,
that
it
was
precisely
what
*NL*
they
did
not
wish
,
and
admired
again
the
sort
of
necessity
which
the
*NL*
family
habits
seemed
to
produce
,
of
everything
being
to
be
*NL*
communicated
,
and
everything
being
to
be
done
together
,
however
*NL*
undesired
and
inconvenient
.
She
tried
to
dissuade
Mary
from
going
,
but
*NL*
in
vain
;
and
that
being
the
case
,
thought
it
best
to
accept
the
Miss
*NL*
Musgroves
'
much
more
cordial
invitation
to
herself
to
go
likewise
,
as
*NL*
she
might
be
useful
in
turning
back
with
her
sister
,
and
lessening
the
*NL*
interference
in
any
plan
of
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
imagine
why
they
should
suppose
I
should
not
like
a
long
*NL*
walk
,
''
said
Mary
,
as
she
went
up
stairs
.
``
Everybody
is
always
*NL*
supposing
that
I
am
not
a
good
walker
;
and
yet
they
would
not
have
been
*NL*
pleased
,
if
we
had
refused
to
join
them
.
When
people
come
in
this
*NL*
manner
on
purpose
to
ask
us
,
how
can
one
say
no
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
they
were
setting
off
,
the
gentlemen
returned
.
They
had
taken
*NL*
out
a
young
dog
,
who
had
spoilt
their
sport
,
and
sent
them
back
early
.
*NL*
Their
time
and
strength
,
and
spirits
,
were
,
therefore
,
exactly
ready
*NL*
for
this
walk
,
and
they
entered
into
it
with
pleasure
.
Could
Anne
have
*NL*
foreseen
such
a
junction
,
she
would
have
staid
at
home
;
but
,
from
some
*NL*
feelings
of
interest
and
curiosity
,
she
fancied
now
that
it
was
too
*NL*
late
to
retract
,
and
the
whole
six
set
forward
together
in
the
*NL*
direction
chosen
by
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
who
evidently
considered
the
*NL*
walk
as
under
their
guidance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
object
was
,
not
to
be
in
the
way
of
anybody
;
and
where
the
*NL*
narrow
paths
across
the
fields
made
many
separations
necessary
,
to
keep
*NL*
with
her
brother
and
sister
.
Her
pleasure
in
the
walk
must
arise
from
*NL*
the
exercise
and
the
day
,
from
the
view
of
the
last
smiles
of
the
year
*NL*
upon
the
tawny
leaves
,
and
withered
hedges
,
and
from
repeating
to
*NL*
herself
some
few
of
the
thousand
poetical
descriptions
extant
of
*NL*
autumn
,
that
season
of
peculiar
and
inexhaustible
influence
on
the
mind
*NL*
of
taste
and
tenderness
,
that
season
which
had
drawn
from
every
poet
,
*NL*
worthy
of
being
read
,
some
attempt
at
description
,
or
some
lines
of
*NL*
feeling
.
She
occupied
her
mind
as
much
as
possible
in
such
like
*NL*
musings
and
quotations
;
but
it
was
not
possible
,
that
when
within
reach
*NL*
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
conversation
with
either
of
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
*NL*
she
should
not
try
to
hear
it
;
yet
she
caught
little
very
remarkable
.
*NL*
It
was
mere
lively
chat
,
such
as
any
young
persons
,
on
an
intimate
*NL*
footing
,
might
fall
into
.
He
was
more
engaged
with
Louisa
than
with
*NL*
Henrietta
.
Louisa
certainly
put
more
forward
for
his
notice
than
her
*NL*
sister
.
This
distinction
appeared
to
increase
,
and
there
was
one
*NL*
speech
of
Louisa
's
which
struck
her
.
After
one
of
the
many
praises
of
*NL*
the
day
,
which
were
continually
bursting
forth
,
Captain
Wentworth
*NL*
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
glorious
weather
for
the
Admiral
and
my
sister
!
They
meant
to
*NL*
take
a
long
drive
this
morning
;
perhaps
we
may
hail
them
from
some
of
*NL*
these
hills
.
They
talked
of
coming
into
this
side
of
the
country
.
I
*NL*
wonder
whereabouts
they
will
upset
to-day
.
Oh
!
it
does
happen
very
*NL*
often
,
I
assure
you
;
but
my
sister
makes
nothing
of
it
;
she
would
as
*NL*
lieve
be
tossed
out
as
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
You
make
the
most
of
it
,
I
know
,
''
cried
Louisa
,
``
but
if
it
were
*NL*
really
so
,
I
should
do
just
the
same
in
her
place
.
If
I
loved
a
man
,
*NL*
as
she
loves
the
Admiral
,
I
would
always
be
with
him
,
nothing
should
*NL*
ever
separate
us
,
and
I
would
rather
be
overturned
by
him
,
than
driven
*NL*
safely
by
anybody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
spoken
with
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
you
?
''
cried
he
,
catching
the
same
tone
;
``
I
honour
you
!
''
And
there
*NL*
was
silence
between
them
for
a
little
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
could
not
immediately
fall
into
a
quotation
again
.
The
sweet
*NL*
scenes
of
autumn
were
for
a
while
put
by
,
unless
some
tender
sonnet
,
*NL*
fraught
with
the
apt
analogy
of
the
declining
year
,
with
declining
*NL*
happiness
,
and
the
images
of
youth
and
hope
,
and
spring
,
all
gone
*NL*
together
,
blessed
her
memory
.
She
roused
herself
to
say
,
as
they
*NL*
struck
by
order
into
another
path
,
``
Is
not
this
one
of
the
ways
to
*NL*
Winthrop
?
''
But
nobody
heard
,
or
,
at
least
,
nobody
answered
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winthrop
,
however
,
or
its
environs
--
for
young
men
are
,
sometimes
to
be
*NL*
met
with
,
strolling
about
near
home
--
was
their
destination
;
and
after
*NL*
another
half
mile
of
gradual
ascent
through
large
enclosures
,
where
the
*NL*
ploughs
at
work
,
and
the
fresh
made
path
spoke
the
farmer
counteracting
*NL*
the
sweets
of
poetical
despondence
,
and
meaning
to
have
spring
again
,
*NL*
they
gained
the
summit
of
the
most
considerable
hill
,
which
parted
*NL*
Uppercross
and
Winthrop
,
and
soon
commanded
a
full
view
of
the
latter
,
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winthrop
,
without
beauty
and
without
dignity
,
was
stretched
before
them
;
*NL*
an
indifferent
house
,
standing
low
,
and
hemmed
in
by
the
barns
and
*NL*
buildings
of
a
farm-yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
exclaimed
,
``
Bless
me
!
here
is
Winthrop
.
I
declare
I
had
no
idea
!
*NL*
Well
now
,
I
think
we
had
better
turn
back
;
I
am
excessively
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
,
conscious
and
ashamed
,
and
seeing
no
cousin
Charles
walking
*NL*
along
any
path
,
or
leaning
against
any
gate
,
was
ready
to
do
as
Mary
*NL*
wished
;
but
``
No
!
''
said
Charles
Musgrove
,
and
``
No
,
no
!
''
cried
Louisa
*NL*
more
eagerly
,
and
taking
her
sister
aside
,
seemed
to
be
arguing
the
*NL*
matter
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
was
very
decidedly
declaring
his
resolution
*NL*
of
calling
on
his
aunt
,
now
that
he
was
so
near
;
and
very
evidently
,
*NL*
though
more
fearfully
,
trying
to
induce
his
wife
to
go
too
.
But
this
*NL*
was
one
of
the
points
on
which
the
lady
shewed
her
strength
;
and
when
*NL*
he
recommended
the
advantage
of
resting
herself
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
*NL*
Winthrop
,
as
she
felt
so
tired
,
she
resolutely
answered
,
``
Oh
!
no
,
*NL*
indeed
!
walking
up
that
hill
again
would
do
her
more
harm
than
any
*NL*
sitting
down
could
do
her
good
;
''
and
,
in
short
,
her
look
and
manner
*NL*
declared
,
that
go
she
would
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
succession
of
these
sort
of
debates
and
consultations
,
*NL*
it
was
settled
between
Charles
and
his
two
sisters
,
that
he
and
*NL*
Henrietta
should
just
run
down
for
a
few
minutes
,
to
see
their
aunt
and
*NL*
cousins
,
while
the
rest
of
the
party
waited
for
them
at
the
top
of
the
*NL*
hill
.
Louisa
seemed
the
principal
arranger
of
the
plan
;
and
,
as
she
*NL*
went
a
little
way
with
them
,
down
the
hill
,
still
talking
to
Henrietta
,
*NL*
Mary
took
the
opportunity
of
looking
scornfully
around
her
,
and
saying
*NL*
to
Captain
Wentworth
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
unpleasant
,
having
such
connexions
!
But
,
I
assure
you
,
I
*NL*
have
never
been
in
the
house
above
twice
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
received
no
other
answer
,
than
an
artificial
,
assenting
smile
,
*NL*
followed
by
a
contemptuous
glance
,
as
he
turned
away
,
which
Anne
*NL*
perfectly
knew
the
meaning
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brow
of
the
hill
,
where
they
remained
,
was
a
cheerful
spot
:
Louisa
*NL*
returned
;
and
Mary
,
finding
a
comfortable
seat
for
herself
on
the
step
*NL*
of
a
stile
,
was
very
well
satisfied
so
long
as
the
others
all
stood
*NL*
about
her
;
but
when
Louisa
drew
Captain
Wentworth
away
,
to
try
for
a
*NL*
gleaning
of
nuts
in
an
adjoining
hedge-row
,
and
they
were
gone
by
*NL*
degrees
quite
out
of
sight
and
sound
,
Mary
was
happy
no
longer
;
she
*NL*
quarrelled
with
her
own
seat
,
was
sure
Louisa
had
got
a
much
better
*NL*
somewhere
,
and
nothing
could
prevent
her
from
going
to
look
for
a
*NL*
better
also
.
She
turned
through
the
same
gate
,
but
could
not
see
them
.
*NL*
Anne
found
a
nice
seat
for
her
,
on
a
dry
sunny
bank
,
under
the
*NL*
hedge-row
,
in
which
she
had
no
doubt
of
their
still
being
,
in
some
spot
*NL*
or
other
.
Mary
sat
down
for
a
moment
,
but
it
would
not
do
;
she
was
*NL*
sure
Louisa
had
found
a
better
seat
somewhere
else
,
and
she
would
go
on
*NL*
till
she
overtook
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
,
really
tired
herself
,
was
glad
to
sit
down
;
and
she
very
soon
*NL*
heard
Captain
Wentworth
and
Louisa
in
the
hedge-row
,
behind
her
,
as
if
*NL*
making
their
way
back
along
the
rough
,
wild
sort
of
channel
,
down
the
*NL*
centre
.
They
were
speaking
as
they
drew
near
.
Louisa
's
voice
was
the
*NL*
first
distinguished
.
She
seemed
to
be
in
the
middle
of
some
eager
*NL*
speech
.
What
Anne
first
heard
was
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
I
made
her
go
.
I
could
not
bear
that
she
should
be
frightened
*NL*
from
the
visit
by
such
nonsense
.
What
!
would
I
be
turned
back
from
*NL*
doing
a
thing
that
I
had
determined
to
do
,
and
that
I
knew
to
be
right
,
*NL*
by
the
airs
and
interference
of
such
a
person
,
or
of
any
person
I
may
*NL*
say
?
No
,
I
have
no
idea
of
being
so
easily
persuaded
.
When
I
have
*NL*
made
up
my
mind
,
I
have
made
it
;
and
Henrietta
seemed
entirely
to
have
*NL*
made
up
hers
to
call
at
Winthrop
to-day
;
and
yet
,
she
was
as
near
*NL*
giving
it
up
,
out
of
nonsensical
complaisance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
have
turned
back
then
,
but
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
indeed
.
I
am
almost
ashamed
to
say
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
for
her
,
to
have
such
a
mind
as
yours
at
hand
!
After
the
hints
*NL*
you
gave
just
now
,
which
did
but
confirm
my
own
observations
,
the
last
*NL*
time
I
was
in
company
with
him
,
I
need
not
affect
to
have
no
*NL*
comprehension
of
what
is
going
on
.
I
see
that
more
than
a
mere
dutiful
*NL*
morning
visit
to
your
aunt
was
in
question
;
and
woe
betide
him
,
and
her
*NL*
too
,
when
it
comes
to
things
of
consequence
,
when
they
are
placed
in
*NL*
circumstances
requiring
fortitude
and
strength
of
mind
,
if
she
have
not
*NL*
resolution
enough
to
resist
idle
interference
in
such
a
trifle
as
this
.
*NL*
Your
sister
is
an
amiable
creature
;
but
yours
is
the
character
of
*NL*
decision
and
firmness
,
I
see
.
If
you
value
her
conduct
or
happiness
,
*NL*
infuse
as
much
of
your
own
spirit
into
her
as
you
can
.
But
this
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
you
have
been
always
doing
.
It
is
the
worst
evil
of
too
*NL*
yielding
and
indecisive
a
character
,
that
no
influence
over
it
can
be
*NL*
depended
on
.
You
are
never
sure
of
a
good
impression
being
durable
;
*NL*
everybody
may
sway
it
.
Let
those
who
would
be
happy
be
firm
.
Here
is
*NL*
a
nut
,
''
said
he
,
catching
one
down
from
an
upper
bough
,
``
to
exemplify
:
*NL*
a
beautiful
glossy
nut
,
which
,
blessed
with
original
strength
,
has
*NL*
outlived
all
the
storms
of
autumn
.
Not
a
puncture
,
not
a
weak
spot
*NL*
anywhere
.
This
nut
,
''
he
continued
,
with
playful
solemnity
,
``
while
so
*NL*
many
of
his
brethren
have
fallen
and
been
trodden
under
foot
,
is
still
*NL*
in
possession
of
all
the
happiness
that
a
hazel
nut
can
be
supposed
*NL*
capable
of
.
''
Then
returning
to
his
former
earnest
tone
--
``
My
first
*NL*
wish
for
all
whom
I
am
interested
in
,
is
that
they
should
be
firm
.
If
*NL*
Louisa
Musgrove
would
be
beautiful
and
happy
in
her
November
of
life
,
*NL*
she
will
cherish
all
her
present
powers
of
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
done
,
and
was
unanswered
.
It
would
have
surprised
Anne
if
*NL*
Louisa
could
have
readily
answered
such
a
speech
:
words
of
such
*NL*
interest
,
spoken
with
such
serious
warmth
!
She
could
imagine
what
*NL*
Louisa
was
feeling
.
For
herself
,
she
feared
to
move
,
lest
she
should
*NL*
be
seen
.
While
she
remained
,
a
bush
of
low
rambling
holly
protected
*NL*
her
,
and
they
were
moving
on
.
Before
they
were
beyond
her
hearing
,
*NL*
however
,
Louisa
spoke
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
is
good-natured
enough
in
many
respects
,
''
said
she
;
``
but
she
does
*NL*
sometimes
provoke
me
excessively
,
by
her
nonsense
and
pride
--
the
Elliot
*NL*
pride
.
She
has
a
great
deal
too
much
of
the
Elliot
pride
.
We
do
so
*NL*
wish
that
Charles
had
married
Anne
instead
.
I
suppose
you
know
he
*NL*
wanted
to
marry
Anne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
pause
,
Captain
Wentworth
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
that
she
refused
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
;
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
that
happen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
exactly
know
,
for
Henrietta
and
I
were
at
school
at
the
time
;
*NL*
but
I
believe
about
a
year
before
he
married
Mary
.
I
wish
she
had
*NL*
accepted
him
.
We
should
all
have
liked
her
a
great
deal
better
;
and
*NL*
papa
and
mamma
always
think
it
was
her
great
friend
Lady
Russell
's
*NL*
doing
,
that
she
did
not
.
They
think
Charles
might
not
be
learned
and
*NL*
bookish
enough
to
please
Lady
Russell
,
and
that
therefore
,
she
*NL*
persuaded
Anne
to
refuse
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sounds
were
retreating
,
and
Anne
distinguished
no
more
.
Her
own
*NL*
emotions
still
kept
her
fixed
.
She
had
much
to
recover
from
,
before
*NL*
she
could
move
.
The
listener
's
proverbial
fate
was
not
absolutely
*NL*
hers
;
she
had
heard
no
evil
of
herself
,
but
she
had
heard
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
very
painful
import
.
She
saw
how
her
own
character
was
considered
*NL*
by
Captain
Wentworth
,
and
there
had
been
just
that
degree
of
feeling
*NL*
and
curiosity
about
her
in
his
manner
which
must
give
her
extreme
*NL*
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
could
,
she
went
after
Mary
,
and
having
found
,
and
walked
*NL*
back
with
her
to
their
former
station
,
by
the
stile
,
felt
some
comfort
*NL*
in
their
whole
party
being
immediately
afterwards
collected
,
and
once
*NL*
more
in
motion
together
.
Her
spirits
wanted
the
solitude
and
silence
*NL*
which
only
numbers
could
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
and
Henrietta
returned
,
bringing
,
as
may
be
conjectured
,
*NL*
Charles
Hayter
with
them
.
The
minutiae
of
the
business
Anne
could
not
*NL*
attempt
to
understand
;
even
Captain
Wentworth
did
not
seem
admitted
to
*NL*
perfect
confidence
here
;
but
that
there
had
been
a
withdrawing
on
the
*NL*
gentleman
's
side
,
and
a
relenting
on
the
lady
's
,
and
that
they
were
now
*NL*
very
glad
to
be
together
again
,
did
not
admit
a
doubt
.
Henrietta
*NL*
looked
a
little
ashamed
,
but
very
well
pleased
;
--
Charles
Hayter
*NL*
exceedingly
happy
:
and
they
were
devoted
to
each
other
almost
from
the
*NL*
first
instant
of
their
all
setting
forward
for
Uppercross
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
now
marked
out
Louisa
for
Captain
Wentworth
;
nothing
could
*NL*
be
plainer
;
and
where
many
divisions
were
necessary
,
or
even
where
they
*NL*
were
not
,
they
walked
side
by
side
nearly
as
much
as
the
other
two
.
In
*NL*
a
long
strip
of
meadow
land
,
where
there
was
ample
space
for
all
,
they
*NL*
were
thus
divided
,
forming
three
distinct
parties
;
and
to
that
party
of
*NL*
the
three
which
boasted
least
animation
,
and
least
complaisance
,
Anne
*NL*
necessarily
belonged
.
She
joined
Charles
and
Mary
,
and
was
tired
*NL*
enough
to
be
very
glad
of
Charles
's
other
arm
;
but
Charles
,
though
in
*NL*
very
good
humour
with
her
,
was
out
of
temper
with
his
wife
.
Mary
had
*NL*
shewn
herself
disobliging
to
him
,
and
was
now
to
reap
the
consequence
,
*NL*
which
consequence
was
his
dropping
her
arm
almost
every
moment
to
cut
*NL*
off
the
heads
of
some
nettles
in
the
hedge
with
his
switch
;
and
when
*NL*
Mary
began
to
complain
of
it
,
and
lament
her
being
ill-used
,
according
*NL*
to
custom
,
in
being
on
the
hedge
side
,
while
Anne
was
never
incommoded
*NL*
on
the
other
,
he
dropped
the
arms
of
both
to
hunt
after
a
weasel
which
*NL*
he
had
a
momentary
glance
of
,
and
they
could
hardly
get
him
along
at
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
long
meadow
bordered
a
lane
,
which
their
footpath
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
it
was
to
cross
,
and
when
the
party
had
all
reached
the
gate
of
exit
,
*NL*
the
carriage
advancing
in
the
same
direction
,
which
had
been
some
time
*NL*
heard
,
was
just
coming
up
,
and
proved
to
be
Admiral
Croft
's
gig
.
He
*NL*
and
his
wife
had
taken
their
intended
drive
,
and
were
returning
home
.
*NL*
Upon
hearing
how
long
a
walk
the
young
people
had
engaged
in
,
they
*NL*
kindly
offered
a
seat
to
any
lady
who
might
be
particularly
tired
;
it
*NL*
would
save
her
a
full
mile
,
and
they
were
going
through
Uppercross
.
*NL*
The
invitation
was
general
,
and
generally
declined
.
The
Miss
Musgroves
*NL*
were
not
at
all
tired
,
and
Mary
was
either
offended
,
by
not
being
asked
*NL*
before
any
of
the
others
,
or
what
Louisa
called
the
Elliot
pride
could
*NL*
not
endure
to
make
a
third
in
a
one
horse
chaise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
walking
party
had
crossed
the
lane
,
and
were
surmounting
an
*NL*
opposite
stile
,
and
the
Admiral
was
putting
his
horse
in
motion
again
,
*NL*
when
Captain
Wentworth
cleared
the
hedge
in
a
moment
to
say
something
*NL*
to
his
sister
.
The
something
might
be
guessed
by
its
effects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Elliot
,
I
am
sure
you
are
tired
,
''
cried
Mrs
Croft
.
``
Do
let
us
*NL*
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
you
home
.
Here
is
excellent
room
for
*NL*
three
,
I
assure
you
.
If
we
were
all
like
you
,
I
believe
we
might
sit
*NL*
four
.
You
must
,
indeed
,
you
must
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
still
in
the
lane
;
and
though
instinctively
beginning
to
*NL*
decline
,
she
was
not
allowed
to
proceed
.
The
Admiral
's
kind
urgency
*NL*
came
in
support
of
his
wife
's
;
they
would
not
be
refused
;
they
*NL*
compressed
themselves
into
the
smallest
possible
space
to
leave
her
a
*NL*
corner
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
without
saying
a
word
,
turned
to
her
,
*NL*
and
quietly
obliged
her
to
be
assisted
into
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
;
he
had
done
it
.
She
was
in
the
carriage
,
and
felt
that
he
had
*NL*
placed
her
there
,
that
his
will
and
his
hands
had
done
it
,
that
she
*NL*
owed
it
to
his
perception
of
her
fatigue
,
and
his
resolution
to
give
*NL*
her
rest
.
She
was
very
much
affected
by
the
view
of
his
disposition
*NL*
towards
her
,
which
all
these
things
made
apparent
.
This
little
*NL*
circumstance
seemed
the
completion
of
all
that
had
gone
before
.
She
*NL*
understood
him
.
He
could
not
forgive
her
,
but
he
could
not
be
*NL*
unfeeling
.
Though
condemning
her
for
the
past
,
and
considering
it
with
*NL*
high
and
unjust
resentment
,
though
perfectly
careless
of
her
,
and
*NL*
though
becoming
attached
to
another
,
still
he
could
not
see
her
suffer
,
*NL*
without
the
desire
of
giving
her
relief
.
It
was
a
remainder
of
former
*NL*
sentiment
;
it
was
an
impulse
of
pure
,
though
unacknowledged
friendship
;
*NL*
it
was
a
proof
of
his
own
warm
and
amiable
heart
,
which
she
could
not
*NL*
contemplate
without
emotions
so
compounded
of
pleasure
and
pain
,
that
*NL*
she
knew
not
which
prevailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
answers
to
the
kindness
and
the
remarks
of
her
companions
were
at
*NL*
first
unconsciously
given
.
They
had
travelled
half
their
way
along
the
*NL*
rough
lane
,
before
she
was
quite
awake
to
what
they
said
.
She
then
*NL*
found
them
talking
of
``
Frederick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
certainly
means
to
have
one
or
other
of
those
two
girls
,
Sophy
,
''
*NL*
said
the
Admiral
;
``
but
there
is
no
saying
which
.
He
has
been
running
*NL*
after
them
,
too
,
long
enough
,
one
would
think
,
to
make
up
his
mind
.
*NL*
Ay
,
this
comes
of
the
peace
.
If
it
were
war
now
,
he
would
have
settled
*NL*
it
long
ago
.
We
sailors
,
Miss
Elliot
,
can
not
afford
to
make
long
*NL*
courtships
in
time
of
war
.
How
many
days
was
it
,
my
dear
,
between
the
*NL*
first
time
of
my
seeing
you
and
our
sitting
down
together
in
our
*NL*
lodgings
at
North
Yarmouth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
better
not
talk
about
it
,
my
dear
,
''
replied
Mrs
Croft
,
*NL*
pleasantly
;
``
for
if
Miss
Elliot
were
to
hear
how
soon
we
came
to
an
*NL*
understanding
,
she
would
never
be
persuaded
that
we
could
be
happy
*NL*
together
.
I
had
known
you
by
character
,
however
,
long
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
I
had
heard
of
you
as
a
very
pretty
girl
,
and
what
were
we
*NL*
to
wait
for
besides
?
I
do
not
like
having
such
things
so
long
in
hand
.
*NL*
I
wish
Frederick
would
spread
a
little
more
canvass
,
and
bring
us
home
*NL*
one
of
these
young
ladies
to
Kellynch
.
Then
there
would
always
be
*NL*
company
for
them
.
And
very
nice
young
ladies
they
both
are
;
I
hardly
*NL*
know
one
from
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
humoured
,
unaffected
girls
,
indeed
,
''
said
Mrs
Croft
,
in
a
*NL*
tone
of
calmer
praise
,
such
as
made
Anne
suspect
that
her
keener
powers
*NL*
might
not
consider
either
of
them
as
quite
worthy
of
her
brother
;
``
and
*NL*
a
very
respectable
family
.
One
could
not
be
connected
with
better
*NL*
people
.
My
dear
Admiral
,
that
post
!
we
shall
certainly
take
that
*NL*
post
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
by
coolly
giving
the
reins
a
better
direction
herself
they
happily
*NL*
passed
the
danger
;
and
by
once
afterwards
judiciously
putting
out
her
*NL*
hand
they
neither
fell
into
a
rut
,
nor
ran
foul
of
a
dung-cart
;
and
*NL*
Anne
,
with
some
amusement
at
their
style
of
driving
,
which
she
imagined
*NL*
no
bad
representation
of
the
general
guidance
of
their
affairs
,
found
*NL*
herself
safely
deposited
by
them
at
the
Cottage
.

Chapter
11
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
now
approached
for
Lady
Russell
's
return
:
the
day
was
even
*NL*
fixed
;
and
Anne
,
being
engaged
to
join
her
as
soon
as
she
was
*NL*
resettled
,
was
looking
forward
to
an
early
removal
to
Kellynch
,
and
*NL*
beginning
to
think
how
her
own
comfort
was
likely
to
be
affected
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
place
her
in
the
same
village
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
within
*NL*
half
a
mile
of
him
;
they
would
have
to
frequent
the
same
church
,
and
*NL*
there
must
be
intercourse
between
the
two
families
.
This
was
against
*NL*
her
;
but
on
the
other
hand
,
he
spent
so
much
of
his
time
at
Uppercross
,
*NL*
that
in
removing
thence
she
might
be
considered
rather
as
leaving
him
*NL*
behind
,
than
as
going
towards
him
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
she
believed
*NL*
she
must
,
on
this
interesting
question
,
be
the
gainer
,
almost
as
*NL*
certainly
as
in
her
change
of
domestic
society
,
in
leaving
poor
Mary
*NL*
for
Lady
Russell
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wished
it
might
be
possible
for
her
to
avoid
ever
seeing
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
at
the
Hall
:
those
rooms
had
witnessed
former
meetings
which
*NL*
would
be
brought
too
painfully
before
her
;
but
she
was
yet
more
anxious
*NL*
for
the
possibility
of
Lady
Russell
and
Captain
Wentworth
never
meeting
*NL*
anywhere
.
They
did
not
like
each
other
,
and
no
renewal
of
acquaintance
*NL*
now
could
do
any
good
;
and
were
Lady
Russell
to
see
them
together
,
she
*NL*
might
think
that
he
had
too
much
self-possession
,
and
she
too
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
points
formed
her
chief
solicitude
in
anticipating
her
removal
*NL*
from
Uppercross
,
where
she
felt
she
had
been
stationed
quite
long
*NL*
enough
.
Her
usefulness
to
little
Charles
would
always
give
some
*NL*
sweetness
to
the
memory
of
her
two
months
'
visit
there
,
but
he
was
*NL*
gaining
strength
apace
,
and
she
had
nothing
else
to
stay
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conclusion
of
her
visit
,
however
,
was
diversified
in
a
way
which
*NL*
she
had
not
at
all
imagined
.
Captain
Wentworth
,
after
being
unseen
and
*NL*
unheard
of
at
Uppercross
for
two
whole
days
,
appeared
again
among
them
*NL*
to
justify
himself
by
a
relation
of
what
had
kept
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
letter
from
his
friend
,
Captain
Harville
,
having
found
him
out
at
*NL*
last
,
had
brought
intelligence
of
Captain
Harville
's
being
settled
with
*NL*
his
family
at
Lyme
for
the
winter
;
of
their
being
therefore
,
quite
*NL*
unknowingly
,
within
twenty
miles
of
each
other
.
Captain
Harville
had
*NL*
never
been
in
good
health
since
a
severe
wound
which
he
received
two
*NL*
years
before
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
's
anxiety
to
see
him
had
determined
*NL*
him
to
go
immediately
to
Lyme
.
He
had
been
there
for
four-and-twenty
*NL*
hours
.
His
acquittal
was
complete
,
his
friendship
warmly
honoured
,
a
*NL*
lively
interest
excited
for
his
friend
,
and
his
description
of
the
fine
*NL*
country
about
Lyme
so
feelingly
attended
to
by
the
party
,
that
an
*NL*
earnest
desire
to
see
Lyme
themselves
,
and
a
project
for
going
thither
*NL*
was
the
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
people
were
all
wild
to
see
Lyme
.
Captain
Wentworth
talked
*NL*
of
going
there
again
himself
,
it
was
only
seventeen
miles
from
*NL*
Uppercross
;
though
November
,
the
weather
was
by
no
means
bad
;
and
,
in
*NL*
short
,
Louisa
,
who
was
the
most
eager
of
the
eager
,
having
formed
the
*NL*
resolution
to
go
,
and
besides
the
pleasure
of
doing
as
she
liked
,
being
*NL*
now
armed
with
the
idea
of
merit
in
maintaining
her
own
way
,
bore
down
*NL*
all
the
wishes
of
her
father
and
mother
for
putting
it
off
till
summer
;
*NL*
and
to
Lyme
they
were
to
go
--
Charles
,
Mary
,
Anne
,
Henrietta
,
Louisa
,
*NL*
and
Captain
Wentworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
heedless
scheme
had
been
to
go
in
the
morning
and
return
at
*NL*
night
;
but
to
this
Mr
Musgrove
,
for
the
sake
of
his
horses
,
would
not
*NL*
consent
;
and
when
it
came
to
be
rationally
considered
,
a
day
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
November
would
not
leave
much
time
for
seeing
a
new
place
,
*NL*
after
deducting
seven
hours
,
as
the
nature
of
the
country
required
,
for
*NL*
going
and
returning
.
They
were
,
consequently
,
to
stay
the
night
there
,
*NL*
and
not
to
be
expected
back
till
the
next
day
's
dinner
.
This
was
felt
*NL*
to
be
a
considerable
amendment
;
and
though
they
all
met
at
the
Great
*NL*
House
at
rather
an
early
breakfast
hour
,
and
set
off
very
punctually
,
*NL*
it
was
so
much
past
noon
before
the
two
carriages
,
Mr
Musgrove
's
coach
*NL*
containing
the
four
ladies
,
and
Charles
's
curricle
,
in
which
he
drove
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
,
were
descending
the
long
hill
into
Lyme
,
and
*NL*
entering
upon
the
still
steeper
street
of
the
town
itself
,
that
it
was
*NL*
very
evident
they
would
not
have
more
than
time
for
looking
about
them
,
*NL*
before
the
light
and
warmth
of
the
day
were
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
securing
accommodations
,
and
ordering
a
dinner
at
one
of
the
*NL*
inns
,
the
next
thing
to
be
done
was
unquestionably
to
walk
directly
*NL*
down
to
the
sea
.
They
were
come
too
late
in
the
year
for
any
amusement
*NL*
or
variety
which
Lyme
,
as
a
public
place
,
might
offer
.
The
rooms
were
*NL*
shut
up
,
the
lodgers
almost
all
gone
,
scarcely
any
family
but
of
the
*NL*
residents
left
;
and
,
as
there
is
nothing
to
admire
in
the
buildings
*NL*
themselves
,
the
remarkable
situation
of
the
town
,
the
principal
street
*NL*
almost
hurrying
into
the
water
,
the
walk
to
the
Cobb
,
skirting
round
*NL*
the
pleasant
little
bay
,
which
,
in
the
season
,
is
animated
with
bathing
*NL*
machines
and
company
;
the
Cobb
itself
,
its
old
wonders
and
new
*NL*
improvements
,
with
the
very
beautiful
line
of
cliffs
stretching
out
to
*NL*
the
east
of
the
town
,
are
what
the
stranger
's
eye
will
seek
;
and
a
very
*NL*
strange
stranger
it
must
be
,
who
does
not
see
charms
in
the
immediate
*NL*
environs
of
Lyme
,
to
make
him
wish
to
know
it
better
.
The
scenes
in
*NL*
its
neighbourhood
,
Charmouth
,
with
its
high
grounds
and
extensive
*NL*
sweeps
of
country
,
and
still
more
,
its
sweet
,
retired
bay
,
backed
by
*NL*
dark
cliffs
,
where
fragments
of
low
rock
among
the
sands
,
make
it
the
*NL*
happiest
spot
for
watching
the
flow
of
the
tide
,
for
sitting
in
*NL*
unwearied
contemplation
;
the
woody
varieties
of
the
cheerful
village
of
*NL*
Up
Lyme
;
and
,
above
all
,
Pinny
,
with
its
green
chasms
between
romantic
*NL*
rocks
,
where
the
scattered
forest
trees
and
orchards
of
luxuriant
*NL*
growth
,
declare
that
many
a
generation
must
have
passed
away
since
the
*NL*
first
partial
falling
of
the
cliff
prepared
the
ground
for
such
a
*NL*
state
,
where
a
scene
so
wonderful
and
so
lovely
is
exhibited
,
as
may
*NL*
more
than
equal
any
of
the
resembling
scenes
of
the
far-famed
Isle
of
*NL*
Wight
:
these
places
must
be
visited
,
and
visited
again
,
to
make
the
*NL*
worth
of
Lyme
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
from
Uppercross
passing
down
by
the
now
deserted
and
*NL*
melancholy
looking
rooms
,
and
still
descending
,
soon
found
themselves
*NL*
on
the
sea-shore
;
and
lingering
only
,
as
all
must
linger
and
gaze
on
a
*NL*
first
return
to
the
sea
,
who
ever
deserved
to
look
on
it
at
all
,
*NL*
proceeded
towards
the
Cobb
,
equally
their
object
in
itself
and
on
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
's
account
:
for
in
a
small
house
,
near
the
foot
of
an
*NL*
old
pier
of
unknown
date
,
were
the
Harvilles
settled
.
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
turned
in
to
call
on
his
friend
;
the
others
walked
on
,
and
he
*NL*
was
to
join
them
on
the
Cobb
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
by
no
means
tired
of
wondering
and
admiring
;
and
not
even
*NL*
Louisa
seemed
to
feel
that
they
had
parted
with
Captain
Wentworth
long
,
*NL*
when
they
saw
him
coming
after
them
,
with
three
companions
,
all
well
*NL*
known
already
,
by
description
,
to
be
Captain
and
Mrs
Harville
,
and
a
*NL*
Captain
Benwick
,
who
was
staying
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Benwick
had
some
time
ago
been
first
lieutenant
of
the
Laconia
;
*NL*
and
the
account
which
Captain
Wentworth
had
given
of
him
,
on
his
return
*NL*
from
Lyme
before
,
his
warm
praise
of
him
as
an
excellent
young
man
and
*NL*
an
officer
,
whom
he
had
always
valued
highly
,
which
must
have
stamped
*NL*
him
well
in
the
esteem
of
every
listener
,
had
been
followed
by
a
little
*NL*
history
of
his
private
life
,
which
rendered
him
perfectly
interesting
*NL*
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
ladies
.
He
had
been
engaged
to
Captain
*NL*
Harville
's
sister
,
and
was
now
mourning
her
loss
.
They
had
been
a
year
*NL*
or
two
waiting
for
fortune
and
promotion
.
Fortune
came
,
his
*NL*
prize-money
as
lieutenant
being
great
;
promotion
,
too
,
came
at
last
;
*NL*
but
Fanny
Harville
did
not
live
to
know
it
.
She
had
died
the
preceding
*NL*
summer
while
he
was
at
sea
.
Captain
Wentworth
believed
it
impossible
*NL*
for
man
to
be
more
attached
to
woman
than
poor
Benwick
had
been
to
*NL*
Fanny
Harville
,
or
to
be
more
deeply
afflicted
under
the
dreadful
*NL*
change
.
He
considered
his
disposition
as
of
the
sort
which
must
suffer
*NL*
heavily
,
uniting
very
strong
feelings
with
quiet
,
serious
,
and
retiring
*NL*
manners
,
and
a
decided
taste
for
reading
,
and
sedentary
pursuits
.
To
*NL*
finish
the
interest
of
the
story
,
the
friendship
between
him
and
the
*NL*
Harvilles
seemed
,
if
possible
,
augmented
by
the
event
which
closed
all
*NL*
their
views
of
alliance
,
and
Captain
Benwick
was
now
living
with
them
*NL*
entirely
.
Captain
Harville
had
taken
his
present
house
for
half
a
*NL*
year
;
his
taste
,
and
his
health
,
and
his
fortune
,
all
directing
him
to
*NL*
a
residence
inexpensive
,
and
by
the
sea
;
and
the
grandeur
of
the
*NL*
country
,
and
the
retirement
of
Lyme
in
the
winter
,
appeared
exactly
*NL*
adapted
to
Captain
Benwick
's
state
of
mind
.
The
sympathy
and
good-will
*NL*
excited
towards
Captain
Benwick
was
very
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
''
said
Anne
to
herself
,
as
they
now
moved
forward
to
meet
the
*NL*
party
,
``
he
has
not
,
perhaps
,
a
more
sorrowing
heart
than
I
have
.
I
*NL*
can
not
believe
his
prospects
so
blighted
for
ever
.
He
is
younger
than
*NL*
I
am
;
younger
in
feeling
,
if
not
in
fact
;
younger
as
a
man
.
He
will
*NL*
rally
again
,
and
be
happy
with
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
met
,
and
were
introduced
.
Captain
Harville
was
a
tall
,
dark
*NL*
man
,
with
a
sensible
,
benevolent
countenance
;
a
little
lame
;
and
from
*NL*
strong
features
and
want
of
health
,
looking
much
older
than
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
.
Captain
Benwick
looked
,
and
was
,
the
youngest
of
the
three
,
*NL*
and
,
compared
with
either
of
them
,
a
little
man
.
He
had
a
pleasing
*NL*
face
and
a
melancholy
air
,
just
as
he
ought
to
have
,
and
drew
back
from
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Harville
,
though
not
equalling
Captain
Wentworth
in
manners
,
*NL*
was
a
perfect
gentleman
,
unaffected
,
warm
,
and
obliging
.
Mrs
Harville
,
*NL*
a
degree
less
polished
than
her
husband
,
seemed
,
however
,
to
have
the
*NL*
same
good
feelings
;
and
nothing
could
be
more
pleasant
than
their
*NL*
desire
of
considering
the
whole
party
as
friends
of
their
own
,
because
*NL*
the
friends
of
Captain
Wentworth
,
or
more
kindly
hospitable
than
their
*NL*
entreaties
for
their
all
promising
to
dine
with
them
.
The
dinner
,
*NL*
already
ordered
at
the
inn
,
was
at
last
,
though
unwillingly
,
accepted
*NL*
as
a
excuse
;
but
they
seemed
almost
hurt
that
Captain
Wentworth
should
*NL*
have
brought
any
such
party
to
Lyme
,
without
considering
it
as
a
thing
*NL*
of
course
that
they
should
dine
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
so
much
attachment
to
Captain
Wentworth
in
all
this
,
and
such
*NL*
a
bewitching
charm
in
a
degree
of
hospitality
so
uncommon
,
so
unlike
*NL*
the
usual
style
of
give-and-take
invitations
,
and
dinners
of
formality
*NL*
and
display
,
that
Anne
felt
her
spirits
not
likely
to
be
benefited
by
*NL*
an
increasing
acquaintance
among
his
brother-officers
.
``
These
would
*NL*
have
been
all
my
friends
,
''
was
her
thought
;
and
she
had
to
struggle
*NL*
against
a
great
tendency
to
lowness
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
quitting
the
Cobb
,
they
all
went
in-doors
with
their
new
friends
,
*NL*
and
found
rooms
so
small
as
none
but
those
who
invite
from
the
heart
*NL*
could
think
capable
of
accommodating
so
many
.
Anne
had
a
moment
's
*NL*
astonishment
on
the
subject
herself
;
but
it
was
soon
lost
in
the
*NL*
pleasanter
feelings
which
sprang
from
the
sight
of
all
the
ingenious
*NL*
contrivances
and
nice
arrangements
of
Captain
Harville
,
to
turn
the
*NL*
actual
space
to
the
best
account
,
to
supply
the
deficiencies
of
*NL*
lodging-house
furniture
,
and
defend
the
windows
and
doors
against
the
*NL*
winter
storms
to
be
expected
.
The
varieties
in
the
fitting-up
of
the
*NL*
rooms
,
where
the
common
necessaries
provided
by
the
owner
,
in
the
*NL*
common
indifferent
plight
,
were
contrasted
with
some
few
articles
of
a
*NL*
rare
species
of
wood
,
excellently
worked
up
,
and
with
something
curious
*NL*
and
valuable
from
all
the
distant
countries
Captain
Harville
had
*NL*
visited
,
were
more
than
amusing
to
Anne
;
connected
as
it
all
was
with
*NL*
his
profession
,
the
fruit
of
its
labours
,
the
effect
of
its
influence
*NL*
on
his
habits
,
the
picture
of
repose
and
domestic
happiness
it
*NL*
presented
,
made
it
to
her
a
something
more
,
or
less
,
than
gratification
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Harville
was
no
reader
;
but
he
had
contrived
excellent
*NL*
accommodations
,
and
fashioned
very
pretty
shelves
,
for
a
tolerable
*NL*
collection
of
well-bound
volumes
,
the
property
of
Captain
Benwick
.
His
*NL*
lameness
prevented
him
from
taking
much
exercise
;
but
a
mind
of
*NL*
usefulness
and
ingenuity
seemed
to
furnish
him
with
constant
employment
*NL*
within
.
He
drew
,
he
varnished
,
he
carpentered
,
he
glued
;
he
made
toys
*NL*
for
the
children
;
he
fashioned
new
netting-needles
and
pins
with
*NL*
improvements
;
and
if
everything
else
was
done
,
sat
down
to
his
large
*NL*
fishing-net
at
one
corner
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
thought
she
left
great
happiness
behind
her
when
they
quitted
the
*NL*
house
;
and
Louisa
,
by
whom
she
found
herself
walking
,
burst
forth
into
*NL*
raptures
of
admiration
and
delight
on
the
character
of
the
navy
;
their
*NL*
friendliness
,
their
brotherliness
,
their
openness
,
their
uprightness
;
*NL*
protesting
that
she
was
convinced
of
sailors
having
more
worth
and
*NL*
warmth
than
any
other
set
of
men
in
England
;
that
they
only
knew
how
to
*NL*
live
,
and
they
only
deserved
to
be
respected
and
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
back
to
dress
and
dine
;
and
so
well
had
the
scheme
answered
*NL*
already
,
that
nothing
was
found
amiss
;
though
its
being
``
so
entirely
*NL*
out
of
season
,
''
and
the
``
no
thoroughfare
of
Lyme
,
''
and
the
``
no
*NL*
expectation
of
company
,
''
had
brought
many
apologies
from
the
heads
of
*NL*
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
found
herself
by
this
time
growing
so
much
more
hardened
to
being
*NL*
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
company
than
she
had
at
first
imagined
could
*NL*
ever
be
,
that
the
sitting
down
to
the
same
table
with
him
now
,
and
the
*NL*
interchange
of
the
common
civilities
attending
on
it
-LRB-
they
never
got
*NL*
beyond
-RRB-
,
was
become
a
mere
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nights
were
too
dark
for
the
ladies
to
meet
again
till
the
morrow
,
*NL*
but
Captain
Harville
had
promised
them
a
visit
in
the
evening
;
and
he
*NL*
came
,
bringing
his
friend
also
,
which
was
more
than
had
been
expected
,
*NL*
it
having
been
agreed
that
Captain
Benwick
had
all
the
appearance
of
*NL*
being
oppressed
by
the
presence
of
so
many
strangers
.
He
ventured
*NL*
among
them
again
,
however
,
though
his
spirits
certainly
did
not
seem
*NL*
fit
for
the
mirth
of
the
party
in
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Captains
Wentworth
and
Harville
led
the
talk
on
one
side
of
the
*NL*
room
,
and
by
recurring
to
former
days
,
supplied
anecdotes
in
abundance
*NL*
to
occupy
and
entertain
the
others
,
it
fell
to
Anne
's
lot
to
be
placed
*NL*
rather
apart
with
Captain
Benwick
;
and
a
very
good
impulse
of
her
*NL*
nature
obliged
her
to
begin
an
acquaintance
with
him
.
He
was
shy
,
and
*NL*
disposed
to
abstraction
;
but
the
engaging
mildness
of
her
countenance
,
*NL*
and
gentleness
of
her
manners
,
soon
had
their
effect
;
and
Anne
was
well
*NL*
repaid
the
first
trouble
of
exertion
.
He
was
evidently
a
young
man
of
*NL*
considerable
taste
in
reading
,
though
principally
in
poetry
;
and
*NL*
besides
the
persuasion
of
having
given
him
at
least
an
evening
's
*NL*
indulgence
in
the
discussion
of
subjects
,
which
his
usual
companions
*NL*
had
probably
no
concern
in
,
she
had
the
hope
of
being
of
real
use
to
*NL*
him
in
some
suggestions
as
to
the
duty
and
benefit
of
struggling
*NL*
against
affliction
,
which
had
naturally
grown
out
of
their
*NL*
conversation
.
For
,
though
shy
,
he
did
not
seem
reserved
;
it
had
rather
*NL*
the
appearance
of
feelings
glad
to
burst
their
usual
restraints
;
and
*NL*
having
talked
of
poetry
,
the
richness
of
the
present
age
,
and
gone
*NL*
through
a
brief
comparison
of
opinion
as
to
the
first-rate
poets
,
*NL*
trying
to
ascertain
whether
Marmion
or
The
Lady
of
the
Lake
were
to
be
*NL*
preferred
,
and
how
ranked
the
Giaour
and
The
Bride
of
Abydos
;
and
*NL*
moreover
,
how
the
Giaour
was
to
be
pronounced
,
he
showed
himself
so
*NL*
intimately
acquainted
with
all
the
tenderest
songs
of
the
one
poet
,
and
*NL*
all
the
impassioned
descriptions
of
hopeless
agony
of
the
other
;
he
*NL*
repeated
,
with
such
tremulous
feeling
,
the
various
lines
which
imaged
a
*NL*
broken
heart
,
or
a
mind
destroyed
by
wretchedness
,
and
looked
so
*NL*
entirely
as
if
he
meant
to
be
understood
,
that
she
ventured
to
hope
he
*NL*
did
not
always
read
only
poetry
,
and
to
say
,
that
she
thought
it
was
*NL*
the
misfortune
of
poetry
to
be
seldom
safely
enjoyed
by
those
who
*NL*
enjoyed
it
completely
;
and
that
the
strong
feelings
which
alone
could
*NL*
estimate
it
truly
were
the
very
feelings
which
ought
to
taste
it
but
*NL*
sparingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
looks
shewing
him
not
pained
,
but
pleased
with
this
allusion
to
his
*NL*
situation
,
she
was
emboldened
to
go
on
;
and
feeling
in
herself
the
*NL*
right
of
seniority
of
mind
,
she
ventured
to
recommend
a
larger
*NL*
allowance
of
prose
in
his
daily
study
;
and
on
being
requested
to
*NL*
particularize
,
mentioned
such
works
of
our
best
moralists
,
such
*NL*
collections
of
the
finest
letters
,
such
memoirs
of
characters
of
worth
*NL*
and
suffering
,
as
occurred
to
her
at
the
moment
as
calculated
to
rouse
*NL*
and
fortify
the
mind
by
the
highest
precepts
,
and
the
strongest
*NL*
examples
of
moral
and
religious
endurances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Benwick
listened
attentively
,
and
seemed
grateful
for
the
*NL*
interest
implied
;
and
though
with
a
shake
of
the
head
,
and
sighs
which
*NL*
declared
his
little
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
any
books
on
grief
like
*NL*
his
,
noted
down
the
names
of
those
she
recommended
,
and
promised
to
*NL*
procure
and
read
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
evening
was
over
,
Anne
could
not
but
be
amused
at
the
idea
of
*NL*
her
coming
to
Lyme
to
preach
patience
and
resignation
to
a
young
man
*NL*
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
;
nor
could
she
help
fearing
,
on
more
*NL*
serious
reflection
,
that
,
like
many
other
great
moralists
and
*NL*
preachers
,
she
had
been
eloquent
on
a
point
in
which
her
own
conduct
*NL*
would
ill
bear
examination
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
12
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
and
Henrietta
,
finding
themselves
the
earliest
of
the
party
the
*NL*
next
morning
,
agreed
to
stroll
down
to
the
sea
before
breakfast
.
They
*NL*
went
to
the
sands
,
to
watch
the
flowing
of
the
tide
,
which
a
fine
*NL*
south-easterly
breeze
was
bringing
in
with
all
the
grandeur
which
so
*NL*
flat
a
shore
admitted
.
They
praised
the
morning
;
gloried
in
the
sea
;
*NL*
sympathized
in
the
delight
of
the
fresh-feeling
breeze
--
and
were
*NL*
silent
;
till
Henrietta
suddenly
began
again
with
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
,
--
I
am
quite
convinced
that
,
with
very
few
exceptions
,
the
*NL*
sea-air
always
does
good
.
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
having
been
of
*NL*
the
greatest
service
to
Dr
Shirley
,
after
his
illness
,
last
spring
*NL*
twelve-month
.
He
declares
himself
,
that
coming
to
Lyme
for
a
month
,
*NL*
did
him
more
good
than
all
the
medicine
he
took
;
and
,
that
being
by
the
*NL*
sea
,
always
makes
him
feel
young
again
.
Now
,
I
can
not
help
thinking
it
*NL*
a
pity
that
he
does
not
live
entirely
by
the
sea
.
I
do
think
he
had
*NL*
better
leave
Uppercross
entirely
,
and
fix
at
Lyme
.
Do
not
you
,
Anne
?
*NL*
Do
not
you
agree
with
me
,
that
it
is
the
best
thing
he
could
do
,
both
*NL*
for
himself
and
Mrs
Shirley
?
She
has
cousins
here
,
you
know
,
and
many
*NL*
acquaintance
,
which
would
make
it
cheerful
for
her
,
and
I
am
sure
she
*NL*
would
be
glad
to
get
to
a
place
where
she
could
have
medical
attendance
*NL*
at
hand
,
in
case
of
his
having
another
seizure
.
Indeed
I
think
it
*NL*
quite
melancholy
to
have
such
excellent
people
as
Dr
and
Mrs
Shirley
,
*NL*
who
have
been
doing
good
all
their
lives
,
wearing
out
their
last
days
*NL*
in
a
place
like
Uppercross
,
where
,
excepting
our
family
,
they
seem
shut
*NL*
out
from
all
the
world
.
I
wish
his
friends
would
propose
it
to
him
.
I
*NL*
really
think
they
ought
.
And
,
as
to
procuring
a
dispensation
,
there
*NL*
could
be
no
difficulty
at
his
time
of
life
,
and
with
his
character
.
My
*NL*
only
doubt
is
,
whether
anything
could
persuade
him
to
leave
his
parish
.
*NL*
He
is
so
very
strict
and
scrupulous
in
his
notions
;
over-scrupulous
I
*NL*
must
say
.
Do
not
you
think
,
Anne
,
it
is
being
over-scrupulous
?
Do
not
*NL*
you
think
it
is
quite
a
mistaken
point
of
conscience
,
when
a
clergyman
*NL*
sacrifices
his
health
for
the
sake
of
duties
,
which
may
be
just
as
well
*NL*
performed
by
another
person
?
And
at
Lyme
too
,
only
seventeen
miles
*NL*
off
,
he
would
be
near
enough
to
hear
,
if
people
thought
there
was
*NL*
anything
to
complain
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
smiled
more
than
once
to
herself
during
this
speech
,
and
entered
*NL*
into
the
subject
,
as
ready
to
do
good
by
entering
into
the
feelings
of
*NL*
a
young
lady
as
of
a
young
man
,
though
here
it
was
good
of
a
lower
*NL*
standard
,
for
what
could
be
offered
but
general
acquiescence
?
She
said
*NL*
all
that
was
reasonable
and
proper
on
the
business
;
felt
the
claims
of
*NL*
Dr
Shirley
to
repose
as
she
ought
;
saw
how
very
desirable
it
was
that
*NL*
he
should
have
some
active
,
respectable
young
man
,
as
a
resident
*NL*
curate
,
and
was
even
courteous
enough
to
hint
at
the
advantage
of
such
*NL*
resident
curate
's
being
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
''
said
Henrietta
,
very
well
pleased
with
her
companion
,
``
I
wish
*NL*
Lady
Russell
lived
at
Uppercross
,
and
were
intimate
with
Dr
Shirley
.
I
*NL*
have
always
heard
of
Lady
Russell
as
a
woman
of
the
greatest
influence
*NL*
with
everybody
!
I
always
look
upon
her
as
able
to
persuade
a
person
to
*NL*
anything
!
I
am
afraid
of
her
,
as
I
have
told
you
before
,
quite
afraid
*NL*
of
her
,
because
she
is
so
very
clever
;
but
I
respect
her
amazingly
,
and
*NL*
wish
we
had
such
a
neighbour
at
Uppercross
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
amused
by
Henrietta
's
manner
of
being
grateful
,
and
amused
*NL*
also
that
the
course
of
events
and
the
new
interests
of
Henrietta
's
*NL*
views
should
have
placed
her
friend
at
all
in
favour
with
any
of
the
*NL*
Musgrove
family
;
she
had
only
time
,
however
,
for
a
general
answer
,
and
*NL*
a
wish
that
such
another
woman
were
at
Uppercross
,
before
all
subjects
*NL*
suddenly
ceased
,
on
seeing
Louisa
and
Captain
Wentworth
coming
towards
*NL*
them
.
They
came
also
for
a
stroll
till
breakfast
was
likely
to
be
*NL*
ready
;
but
Louisa
recollecting
,
immediately
afterwards
that
she
had
*NL*
something
to
procure
at
a
shop
,
invited
them
all
to
go
back
with
her
*NL*
into
the
town
.
They
were
all
at
her
disposal
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
came
to
the
steps
,
leading
upwards
from
the
beach
,
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
at
the
same
moment
preparing
to
come
down
,
politely
drew
*NL*
back
,
and
stopped
to
give
them
way
.
They
ascended
and
passed
him
;
and
*NL*
as
they
passed
,
Anne
's
face
caught
his
eye
,
and
he
looked
at
her
with
a
*NL*
degree
of
earnest
admiration
,
which
she
could
not
be
insensible
of
.
*NL*
She
was
looking
remarkably
well
;
her
very
regular
,
very
pretty
*NL*
features
,
having
the
bloom
and
freshness
of
youth
restored
by
the
fine
*NL*
wind
which
had
been
blowing
on
her
complexion
,
and
by
the
animation
of
*NL*
eye
which
it
had
also
produced
.
It
was
evident
that
the
gentleman
,
*NL*
-LRB-
completely
a
gentleman
in
manner
-RRB-
admired
her
exceedingly
.
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
looked
round
at
her
instantly
in
a
way
which
shewed
his
*NL*
noticing
of
it
.
He
gave
her
a
momentary
glance
,
a
glance
of
*NL*
brightness
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
``
That
man
is
struck
with
you
,
and
even
*NL*
I
,
at
this
moment
,
see
something
like
Anne
Elliot
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
attending
Louisa
through
her
business
,
and
loitering
about
a
*NL*
little
longer
,
they
returned
to
the
inn
;
and
Anne
,
in
passing
*NL*
afterwards
quickly
from
her
own
chamber
to
their
dining-room
,
had
*NL*
nearly
run
against
the
very
same
gentleman
,
as
he
came
out
of
an
*NL*
adjoining
apartment
.
She
had
before
conjectured
him
to
be
a
stranger
*NL*
like
themselves
,
and
determined
that
a
well-looking
groom
,
who
was
*NL*
strolling
about
near
the
two
inns
as
they
came
back
,
should
be
his
*NL*
servant
.
Both
master
and
man
being
in
mourning
assisted
the
idea
.
It
*NL*
was
now
proved
that
he
belonged
to
the
same
inn
as
themselves
;
and
this
*NL*
second
meeting
,
short
as
it
was
,
also
proved
again
by
the
gentleman
's
*NL*
looks
,
that
he
thought
hers
very
lovely
,
and
by
the
readiness
and
*NL*
propriety
of
his
apologies
,
that
he
was
a
man
of
exceedingly
good
*NL*
manners
.
He
seemed
about
thirty
,
and
though
not
handsome
,
had
an
*NL*
agreeable
person
.
Anne
felt
that
she
should
like
to
know
who
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
nearly
done
breakfast
,
when
the
sound
of
a
carriage
,
-LRB-
almost
*NL*
the
first
they
had
heard
since
entering
Lyme
-RRB-
drew
half
the
party
to
*NL*
the
window
.
It
was
a
gentleman
's
carriage
,
a
curricle
,
but
only
coming
*NL*
round
from
the
stable-yard
to
the
front
door
;
somebody
must
be
going
*NL*
away
.
It
was
driven
by
a
servant
in
mourning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
curricle
made
Charles
Musgrove
jump
up
that
he
might
compare
*NL*
it
with
his
own
;
the
servant
in
mourning
roused
Anne
's
curiosity
,
and
*NL*
the
whole
six
were
collected
to
look
,
by
the
time
the
owner
of
the
*NL*
curricle
was
to
be
seen
issuing
from
the
door
amidst
the
bows
and
*NL*
civilities
of
the
household
,
and
taking
his
seat
,
to
drive
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
cried
Captain
Wentworth
,
instantly
,
and
with
half
a
glance
at
*NL*
Anne
,
``
it
is
the
very
man
we
passed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Musgroves
agreed
to
it
;
and
having
all
kindly
watched
him
as
*NL*
far
up
the
hill
as
they
could
,
they
returned
to
the
breakfast
table
.
*NL*
The
waiter
came
into
the
room
soon
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
''
said
Captain
Wentworth
,
immediately
,
``
can
you
tell
us
the
name
*NL*
of
the
gentleman
who
is
just
gone
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Sir
,
a
Mr
Elliot
,
a
gentleman
of
large
fortune
,
came
in
last
*NL*
night
from
Sidmouth
.
Dare
say
you
heard
the
carriage
,
sir
,
while
you
*NL*
were
at
dinner
;
and
going
on
now
for
Crewkherne
,
in
his
way
to
Bath
and
*NL*
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elliot
!
''
Many
had
looked
on
each
other
,
and
many
had
repeated
the
*NL*
name
,
before
all
this
had
been
got
through
,
even
by
the
smart
rapidity
*NL*
of
a
waiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
me
!
''
cried
Mary
;
``
it
must
be
our
cousin
;
it
must
be
our
Mr
*NL*
Elliot

it
must

indeed

Charles

Anne
,
must
not
it
?
In
mourning

you
*NL*
see

just
as
our
Mr
Elliot
must
be

How
very
extraordinary
!
In
the
*NL*
very
same
inn
with
us
!
Anne

must
not
it
be
our
Mr
Elliot
?
my
*NL*
father
's
next
heir
?
Pray
sir

''
turning
to
the
waiter
,
``
did
not
you
*NL*
hear
,
did
not
his
servant
say
whether
he
belonged
to
the
Kellynch
*NL*
family

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
,
he
did
not
mention
no
particular
family
;
but
he
said
his

master
was
a
very
rich
gentleman
,
and
would
be
a
baronight
some
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
you
see
!
''
cried
Mary
in
an
ecstasy
,
``
just
as
I
said
!
Heir
to
*NL*
Sir
Walter
Elliot
!
I
was
sure
that
would
come
out
,
if
it
was
so
.
*NL*
Depend
upon
it
,
that
is
a
circumstance
which
his
servants
take
care
to
*NL*
publish
,
wherever
he
goes
.
But
,
Anne
,
only
conceive
how
extraordinary
!
*NL*
I
wish
I
had
looked
at
him
more
.
I
wish
we
had
been
aware
in
time
,
who
*NL*
it
was
,
that
he
might
have
been
introduced
to
us
.
What
a
pity
that
we
*NL*
should
not
have
been
introduced
to
each
other
!
Do
you
think
he
had
the
*NL*
Elliot
countenance
?
I
hardly
looked
at
him
,
I
was
looking
at
the
*NL*
horses
;
but
I
think
he
had
something
of
the
Elliot
countenance
,
I
*NL*
wonder
the
arms
did
not
strike
me
!
Oh
!
the
great-coat
was
hanging
over
*NL*
the
panel
,
and
hid
the
arms
,
so
it
did
;
otherwise
,
I
am
sure
,
I
should
*NL*
have
observed
them
,
and
the
livery
too
;
if
the
servant
had
not
been
in
*NL*
mourning
,
one
should
have
known
him
by
the
livery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Putting
all
these
very
extraordinary
circumstances
together
,
''
said
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
,
``
we
must
consider
it
to
be
the
arrangement
of
*NL*
Providence
,
that
you
should
not
be
introduced
to
your
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
could
command
Mary
's
attention
,
Anne
quietly
tried
to
convince
*NL*
her
that
their
father
and
Mr
Elliot
had
not
,
for
many
years
,
been
on
*NL*
such
terms
as
to
make
the
power
of
attempting
an
introduction
at
all
*NL*
desirable
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
however
,
it
was
a
secret
gratification
to
herself
to
*NL*
have
seen
her
cousin
,
and
to
know
that
the
future
owner
of
Kellynch
was
*NL*
undoubtedly
a
gentleman
,
and
had
an
air
of
good
sense
.
She
would
not
,
*NL*
upon
any
account
,
mention
her
having
met
with
him
the
second
time
;
*NL*
luckily
Mary
did
not
much
attend
to
their
having
passed
close
by
him
in
*NL*
their
earlier
walk
,
but
she
would
have
felt
quite
ill-used
by
Anne
's
*NL*
having
actually
run
against
him
in
the
passage
,
and
received
his
very
*NL*
polite
excuses
,
while
she
had
never
been
near
him
at
all
;
no
,
that
*NL*
cousinly
little
interview
must
remain
a
perfect
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
Mary
,
``
you
will
mention
our
seeing
Mr
Elliot
,
the
*NL*
next
time
you
write
to
Bath
.
I
think
my
father
certainly
ought
to
hear
*NL*
of
it
;
do
mention
all
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
avoided
a
direct
reply
,
but
it
was
just
the
circumstance
which
she
*NL*
considered
as
not
merely
unnecessary
to
be
communicated
,
but
as
what
*NL*
ought
to
be
suppressed
.
The
offence
which
had
been
given
her
father
,
*NL*
many
years
back
,
she
knew
;
Elizabeth
's
particular
share
in
it
she
*NL*
suspected
;
and
that
Mr
Elliot
's
idea
always
produced
irritation
in
both
*NL*
was
beyond
a
doubt
.
Mary
never
wrote
to
Bath
herself
;
all
the
toil
of
*NL*
keeping
up
a
slow
and
unsatisfactory
correspondence
with
Elizabeth
fell
*NL*
on
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Breakfast
had
not
been
long
over
,
when
they
were
joined
by
Captain
and
*NL*
Mrs
Harville
and
Captain
Benwick
;
with
whom
they
had
appointed
to
take
*NL*
their
last
walk
about
Lyme
.
They
ought
to
be
setting
off
for
*NL*
Uppercross
by
one
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
were
to
be
all
together
,
and
*NL*
out
of
doors
as
long
as
they
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
found
Captain
Benwick
getting
near
her
,
as
soon
as
they
were
all
*NL*
fairly
in
the
street
.
Their
conversation
the
preceding
evening
did
not
*NL*
disincline
him
to
seek
her
again
;
and
they
walked
together
some
time
,
*NL*
talking
as
before
of
Mr
Scott
and
Lord
Byron
,
and
still
as
unable
as
*NL*
before
,
and
as
unable
as
any
other
two
readers
,
to
think
exactly
alike
*NL*
of
the
merits
of
either
,
till
something
occasioned
an
almost
general
*NL*
change
amongst
their
party
,
and
instead
of
Captain
Benwick
,
she
had
*NL*
Captain
Harville
by
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Elliot
,
''
said
he
,
speaking
rather
low
,
``
you
have
done
a
good
deed
*NL*
in
making
that
poor
fellow
talk
so
much
.
I
wish
he
could
have
such
*NL*
company
oftener
.
It
is
bad
for
him
,
I
know
,
to
be
shut
up
as
he
is
;
*NL*
but
what
can
we
do
?
We
can
not
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Anne
,
``
that
I
can
easily
believe
to
be
impossible
;
but
in
*NL*
time
,
perhaps
--
we
know
what
time
does
in
every
case
of
affliction
,
and
*NL*
you
must
remember
,
Captain
Harville
,
that
your
friend
may
yet
be
called
*NL*
a
young
mourner
--
only
last
summer
,
I
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
true
enough
,
''
-LRB-
with
a
deep
sigh
-RRB-
``
only
June
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
known
to
him
,
perhaps
,
so
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
till
the
first
week
of
August
,
when
he
came
home
from
the
Cape
,
*NL*
just
made
into
the
Grappler
.
I
was
at
Plymouth
dreading
to
hear
of
*NL*
him
;
he
sent
in
letters
,
but
the
Grappler
was
under
orders
for
*NL*
Portsmouth
.
There
the
news
must
follow
him
,
but
who
was
to
tell
it
?
*NL*
not
I.
I
would
as
soon
have
been
run
up
to
the
yard-arm
.
Nobody
could
*NL*
do
it
,
but
that
good
fellow
''
-LRB-
pointing
to
Captain
Wentworth
.
-RRB-
``
The
*NL*
Laconia
had
come
into
Plymouth
the
week
before
;
no
danger
of
her
being
*NL*
sent
to
sea
again
.
He
stood
his
chance
for
the
rest
;
wrote
up
for
*NL*
leave
of
absence
,
but
without
waiting
the
return
,
travelled
night
and
*NL*
day
till
he
got
to
Portsmouth
,
rowed
off
to
the
Grappler
that
instant
,
*NL*
and
never
left
the
poor
fellow
for
a
week
.
That
's
what
he
did
,
and
*NL*
nobody
else
could
have
saved
poor
James
.
You
may
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
*NL*
whether
he
is
dear
to
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
did
think
on
the
question
with
perfect
decision
,
and
said
as
much
*NL*
in
reply
as
her
own
feeling
could
accomplish
,
or
as
his
seemed
able
to
*NL*
bear
,
for
he
was
too
much
affected
to
renew
the
subject
,
and
when
he
*NL*
spoke
again
,
it
was
of
something
totally
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Harville
's
giving
it
as
her
opinion
that
her
husband
would
have
*NL*
quite
walking
enough
by
the
time
he
reached
home
,
determined
the
*NL*
direction
of
all
the
party
in
what
was
to
be
their
last
walk
;
they
*NL*
would
accompany
them
to
their
door
,
and
then
return
and
set
off
*NL*
themselves
.
By
all
their
calculations
there
was
just
time
for
this
;
*NL*
but
as
they
drew
near
the
Cobb
,
there
was
such
a
general
wish
to
walk
*NL*
along
it
once
more
,
all
were
so
inclined
,
and
Louisa
soon
grew
so
*NL*
determined
,
that
the
difference
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
it
was
found
,
*NL*
would
be
no
difference
at
all
;
so
with
all
the
kind
leave-taking
,
and
*NL*
all
the
kind
interchange
of
invitations
and
promises
which
may
be
*NL*
imagined
,
they
parted
from
Captain
and
Mrs
Harville
at
their
own
door
,
*NL*
and
still
accompanied
by
Captain
Benwick
,
who
seemed
to
cling
to
them
*NL*
to
the
last
,
proceeded
to
make
the
proper
adieus
to
the
Cobb
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
found
Captain
Benwick
again
drawing
near
her
.
Lord
Byron
's
``
dark
*NL*
blue
seas
''
could
not
fail
of
being
brought
forward
by
their
present
*NL*
view
,
and
she
gladly
gave
him
all
her
attention
as
long
as
attention
*NL*
was
possible
.
It
was
soon
drawn
,
perforce
another
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
too
much
wind
to
make
the
high
part
of
the
new
Cobb
pleasant
*NL*
for
the
ladies
,
and
they
agreed
to
get
down
the
steps
to
the
lower
,
and
*NL*
all
were
contented
to
pass
quietly
and
carefully
down
the
steep
flight
,
*NL*
excepting
Louisa
;
she
must
be
jumped
down
them
by
Captain
Wentworth
.
*NL*
In
all
their
walks
,
he
had
had
to
jump
her
from
the
stiles
;
the
*NL*
sensation
was
delightful
to
her
.
The
hardness
of
the
pavement
for
her
*NL*
feet
,
made
him
less
willing
upon
the
present
occasion
;
he
did
it
,
*NL*
however
.
She
was
safely
down
,
and
instantly
,
to
show
her
enjoyment
,
*NL*
ran
up
the
steps
to
be
jumped
down
again
.
He
advised
her
against
it
,
*NL*
thought
the
jar
too
great
;
but
no
,
he
reasoned
and
talked
in
vain
,
she
*NL*
smiled
and
said
,
``
I
am
determined
I
will
:
''
he
put
out
his
hands
;
she
*NL*
was
too
precipitate
by
half
a
second
,
she
fell
on
the
pavement
on
the
*NL*
Lower
Cobb
,
and
was
taken
up
lifeless
!
There
was
no
wound
,
no
blood
,
*NL*
no
visible
bruise
;
but
her
eyes
were
closed
,
she
breathed
not
,
her
face
*NL*
was
like
death
.
The
horror
of
the
moment
to
all
who
stood
around
!
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
,
who
had
caught
her
up
,
knelt
with
her
in
his
arms
,
*NL*
looking
on
her
with
a
face
as
pallid
as
her
own
,
in
an
agony
of
*NL*
silence
.
``
She
is
dead
!
she
is
dead
!
''
screamed
Mary
,
catching
hold
of
*NL*
her
husband
,
and
contributing
with
his
own
horror
to
make
him
*NL*
immoveable
;
and
in
another
moment
,
Henrietta
,
sinking
under
the
*NL*
conviction
,
lost
her
senses
too
,
and
would
have
fallen
on
the
steps
,
*NL*
but
for
Captain
Benwick
and
Anne
,
who
caught
and
supported
her
between
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
no
one
to
help
me
?
''
were
the
first
words
which
burst
from
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
a
tone
of
despair
,
and
as
if
all
his
own
strength
*NL*
were
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
him
,
go
to
him
,
''
cried
Anne
,
``
for
heaven
's
sake
go
to
him
.
I
*NL*
can
support
her
myself
.
Leave
me
,
and
go
to
him
.
Rub
her
hands
,
rub
*NL*
her
temples
;
here
are
salts
;
take
them
,
take
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Benwick
obeyed
,
and
Charles
at
the
same
moment
,
disengaging
*NL*
himself
from
his
wife
,
they
were
both
with
him
;
and
Louisa
was
raised
*NL*
up
and
supported
more
firmly
between
them
,
and
everything
was
done
that
*NL*
Anne
had
prompted
,
but
in
vain
;
while
Captain
Wentworth
,
staggering
*NL*
against
the
wall
for
his
support
,
exclaimed
in
the
bitterest
agony
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
God
!
her
father
and
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
surgeon
!
''
said
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
caught
the
word
;
it
seemed
to
rouse
him
at
once
,
and
saying
only
--
*NL*
``
True
,
true
,
a
surgeon
this
instant
,
''
was
darting
away
,
when
Anne
*NL*
eagerly
suggested
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Benwick
,
would
not
it
be
better
for
Captain
Benwick
?
He
knows
*NL*
where
a
surgeon
is
to
be
found
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
capable
of
thinking
felt
the
advantage
of
the
idea
,
and
in
a
*NL*
moment
-LRB-
it
was
all
done
in
rapid
moments
-RRB-
Captain
Benwick
had
resigned
*NL*
the
poor
corpse-like
figure
entirely
to
the
brother
's
care
,
and
was
*NL*
off
for
the
town
with
the
utmost
rapidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
wretched
party
left
behind
,
it
could
scarcely
be
said
which
*NL*
of
the
three
,
who
were
completely
rational
,
was
suffering
most
:
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
,
Anne
,
or
Charles
,
who
,
really
a
very
affectionate
brother
,
*NL*
hung
over
Louisa
with
sobs
of
grief
,
and
could
only
turn
his
eyes
from
*NL*
one
sister
,
to
see
the
other
in
a
state
as
insensible
,
or
to
witness
*NL*
the
hysterical
agitations
of
his
wife
,
calling
on
him
for
help
which
he
*NL*
could
not
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
,
attending
with
all
the
strength
and
zeal
,
and
thought
,
which
*NL*
instinct
supplied
,
to
Henrietta
,
still
tried
,
at
intervals
,
to
suggest
*NL*
comfort
to
the
others
,
tried
to
quiet
Mary
,
to
animate
Charles
,
to
*NL*
assuage
the
feelings
of
Captain
Wentworth
.
Both
seemed
to
look
to
her
*NL*
for
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
Anne
,
''
cried
Charles
,
``
What
is
to
be
done
next
?
What
,
in
*NL*
heaven
's
name
,
is
to
be
done
next
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
's
eyes
were
also
turned
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
not
she
better
be
carried
to
the
inn
?
Yes
,
I
am
sure
:
carry
her
*NL*
gently
to
the
inn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
to
the
inn
,
''
repeated
Captain
Wentworth
,
comparatively
*NL*
collected
,
and
eager
to
be
doing
something
.
``
I
will
carry
her
myself

*NL*
Musgrove
,
take
care
of
the
others

''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
report
of
the
accident
had
spread
among
the
workmen
*NL*
and
boatmen
about
the
Cobb
,
and
many
were
collected
near
them
,
to
be
*NL*
useful
if
wanted
,
at
any
rate
,
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
a
dead
young
lady
,
*NL*
nay
,
two
dead
young
ladies
,
for
it
proved
twice
as
fine
as
the
first
*NL*
report
.
To
some
of
the
best-looking
of
these
good
people
Henrietta
was
*NL*
consigned
,
for
,
though
partially
revived
,
she
was
quite
helpless
;
and
*NL*
in
this
manner
,
Anne
walking
by
her
side
,
and
Charles
attending
to
his
*NL*
wife
,
they
set
forward
,
treading
back
with
feelings
unutterable
,
the
*NL*
ground
,
which
so
lately
,
so
very
lately
,
and
so
light
of
heart
,
they
*NL*
had
passed
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
not
off
the
Cobb
,
before
the
Harvilles
met
them
.
Captain
*NL*
Benwick
had
been
seen
flying
by
their
house
,
with
a
countenance
which
*NL*
showed
something
to
be
wrong
;
and
they
had
set
off
immediately
,
*NL*
informed
and
directed
as
they
passed
,
towards
the
spot
.
Shocked
as
*NL*
Captain
Harville
was
,
he
brought
senses
and
nerves
that
could
be
*NL*
instantly
useful
;
and
a
look
between
him
and
his
wife
decided
what
was
*NL*
to
be
done
.
She
must
be
taken
to
their
house
;
all
must
go
to
their
*NL*
house
;
and
await
the
surgeon
's
arrival
there
.
They
would
not
listen
to
*NL*
scruples
:
he
was
obeyed
;
they
were
all
beneath
his
roof
;
and
while
*NL*
Louisa
,
under
Mrs
Harville
's
direction
,
was
conveyed
up
stairs
,
and
*NL*
given
possession
of
her
own
bed
,
assistance
,
cordials
,
restoratives
*NL*
were
supplied
by
her
husband
to
all
who
needed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
had
once
opened
her
eyes
,
but
soon
closed
them
again
,
without
*NL*
apparent
consciousness
.
This
had
been
a
proof
of
life
,
however
,
of
*NL*
service
to
her
sister
;
and
Henrietta
,
though
perfectly
incapable
of
*NL*
being
in
the
same
room
with
Louisa
,
was
kept
,
by
the
agitation
of
hope
*NL*
and
fear
,
from
a
return
of
her
own
insensibility
.
Mary
,
too
,
was
*NL*
growing
calmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
surgeon
was
with
them
almost
before
it
had
seemed
possible
.
They
*NL*
were
sick
with
horror
,
while
he
examined
;
but
he
was
not
hopeless
.
The
*NL*
head
had
received
a
severe
contusion
,
but
he
had
seen
greater
injuries
*NL*
recovered
from
:
he
was
by
no
means
hopeless
;
he
spoke
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
he
did
not
regard
it
as
a
desperate
case
,
that
he
did
not
say
a
*NL*
few
hours
must
end
it
,
was
at
first
felt
,
beyond
the
hope
of
most
;
and
*NL*
the
ecstasy
of
such
a
reprieve
,
the
rejoicing
,
deep
and
silent
,
after
a
*NL*
few
fervent
ejaculations
of
gratitude
to
Heaven
had
been
offered
,
may
*NL*
be
conceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
,
the
look
,
with
which
``
Thank
God
!
''
was
uttered
by
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
,
Anne
was
sure
could
never
be
forgotten
by
her
;
nor
the
sight
*NL*
of
him
afterwards
,
as
he
sat
near
a
table
,
leaning
over
it
with
folded
*NL*
arms
and
face
concealed
,
as
if
overpowered
by
the
various
feelings
of
*NL*
his
soul
,
and
trying
by
prayer
and
reflection
to
calm
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
's
limbs
had
escaped
.
There
was
no
injury
but
to
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
now
became
necessary
for
the
party
to
consider
what
was
best
to
be
*NL*
done
,
as
to
their
general
situation
.
They
were
now
able
to
speak
to
*NL*
each
other
and
consult
.
That
Louisa
must
remain
where
she
was
,
however
*NL*
distressing
to
her
friends
to
be
involving
the
Harvilles
in
such
*NL*
trouble
,
did
not
admit
a
doubt
.
Her
removal
was
impossible
.
The
*NL*
Harvilles
silenced
all
scruples
;
and
,
as
much
as
they
could
,
all
*NL*
gratitude
.
They
had
looked
forward
and
arranged
everything
before
the
*NL*
others
began
to
reflect
.
Captain
Benwick
must
give
up
his
room
to
*NL*
them
,
and
get
another
bed
elsewhere
;
and
the
whole
was
settled
.
They
*NL*
were
only
concerned
that
the
house
could
accommodate
no
more
;
and
yet
*NL*
perhaps
,
by
``
putting
the
children
away
in
the
maid
's
room
,
or
swinging
*NL*
a
cot
somewhere
,
''
they
could
hardly
bear
to
think
of
not
finding
room
*NL*
for
two
or
three
besides
,
supposing
they
might
wish
to
stay
;
though
,
*NL*
with
regard
to
any
attendance
on
Miss
Musgrove
,
there
need
not
be
the
*NL*
least
uneasiness
in
leaving
her
to
Mrs
Harville
's
care
entirely
.
Mrs
*NL*
Harville
was
a
very
experienced
nurse
,
and
her
nursery-maid
,
who
had
*NL*
lived
with
her
long
,
and
gone
about
with
her
everywhere
,
was
just
such
*NL*
another
.
Between
these
two
,
she
could
want
no
possible
attendance
by
*NL*
day
or
night
.
And
all
this
was
said
with
a
truth
and
sincerity
of
*NL*
feeling
irresistible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
,
Henrietta
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
were
the
three
in
*NL*
consultation
,
and
for
a
little
while
it
was
only
an
interchange
of
*NL*
perplexity
and
terror
.
``
Uppercross
,
the
necessity
of
some
one
's
going
*NL*
to
Uppercross
;
the
news
to
be
conveyed
;
how
it
could
be
broken
to
Mr
*NL*
and
Mrs
Musgrove
;
the
lateness
of
the
morning
;
an
hour
already
gone
*NL*
since
they
ought
to
have
been
off
;
the
impossibility
of
being
in
*NL*
tolerable
time
.
''
At
first
,
they
were
capable
of
nothing
more
to
the
*NL*
purpose
than
such
exclamations
;
but
,
after
a
while
,
Captain
Wentworth
,
*NL*
exerting
himself
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
be
decided
,
and
without
the
loss
of
another
minute
.
Every
*NL*
minute
is
valuable
.
Some
one
must
resolve
on
being
off
for
Uppercross
*NL*
instantly
.
Musgrove
,
either
you
or
I
must
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
agreed
,
but
declared
his
resolution
of
not
going
away
.
He
*NL*
would
be
as
little
incumbrance
as
possible
to
Captain
and
Mrs
Harville
;
*NL*
but
as
to
leaving
his
sister
in
such
a
state
,
he
neither
ought
,
nor
*NL*
would
.
So
far
it
was
decided
;
and
Henrietta
at
first
declared
the
*NL*
same
.
She
,
however
,
was
soon
persuaded
to
think
differently
.
The
*NL*
usefulness
of
her
staying
!
She
who
had
not
been
able
to
remain
in
*NL*
Louisa
's
room
,
or
to
look
at
her
,
without
sufferings
which
made
her
*NL*
worse
than
helpless
!
She
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
she
could
do
*NL*
no
good
,
yet
was
still
unwilling
to
be
away
,
till
,
touched
by
the
*NL*
thought
of
her
father
and
mother
,
she
gave
it
up
;
she
consented
,
she
*NL*
was
anxious
to
be
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
plan
had
reached
this
point
,
when
Anne
,
coming
quietly
down
from
*NL*
Louisa
's
room
,
could
not
but
hear
what
followed
,
for
the
parlour
door
*NL*
was
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
settled
,
Musgrove
,
''
cried
Captain
Wentworth
,
``
that
you
*NL*
stay
,
and
that
I
take
care
of
your
sister
home
.
But
as
to
the
rest
,
as
*NL*
to
the
others
,
if
one
stays
to
assist
Mrs
Harville
,
I
think
it
need
be
*NL*
only
one
.
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
will
,
of
course
,
wish
to
get
back
to
*NL*
her
children
;
but
if
Anne
will
stay
,
no
one
so
proper
,
so
capable
as
*NL*
Anne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
a
moment
to
recover
from
the
emotion
of
hearing
herself
so
*NL*
spoken
of
.
The
other
two
warmly
agreed
with
what
he
said
,
and
she
then
*NL*
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
stay
,
I
am
sure
;
you
will
stay
and
nurse
her
;
''
cried
he
,
*NL*
turning
to
her
and
speaking
with
a
glow
,
and
yet
a
gentleness
,
which
*NL*
seemed
almost
restoring
the
past
.
She
coloured
deeply
,
and
he
*NL*
recollected
himself
and
moved
away
.
She
expressed
herself
most
*NL*
willing
,
ready
,
happy
to
remain
.
``
It
was
what
she
had
been
thinking
*NL*
of
,
and
wishing
to
be
allowed
to
do
.
A
bed
on
the
floor
in
Louisa
's
*NL*
room
would
be
sufficient
for
her
,
if
Mrs
Harville
would
but
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
more
,
and
all
seemed
arranged
.
Though
it
was
rather
*NL*
desirable
that
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
should
be
previously
alarmed
by
some
*NL*
share
of
delay
;
yet
the
time
required
by
the
Uppercross
horses
to
take
*NL*
them
back
,
would
be
a
dreadful
extension
of
suspense
;
and
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
proposed
,
and
Charles
Musgrove
agreed
,
that
it
would
be
much
*NL*
better
for
him
to
take
a
chaise
from
the
inn
,
and
leave
Mr
Musgrove
's
*NL*
carriage
and
horses
to
be
sent
home
the
next
morning
early
,
when
there
*NL*
would
be
the
farther
advantage
of
sending
an
account
of
Louisa
's
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
now
hurried
off
to
get
everything
ready
on
his
part
,
*NL*
and
to
be
soon
followed
by
the
two
ladies
.
When
the
plan
was
made
*NL*
known
to
Mary
,
however
,
there
was
an
end
of
all
peace
in
it
.
She
was
*NL*
so
wretched
and
so
vehement
,
complained
so
much
of
injustice
in
being
*NL*
expected
to
go
away
instead
of
Anne
;
Anne
,
who
was
nothing
to
Louisa
,
*NL*
while
she
was
her
sister
,
and
had
the
best
right
to
stay
in
Henrietta
's
*NL*
stead
!
Why
was
not
she
to
be
as
useful
as
Anne
?
And
to
go
home
*NL*
without
Charles
,
too
,
without
her
husband
!
No
,
it
was
too
unkind
.
And
*NL*
in
short
,
she
said
more
than
her
husband
could
long
withstand
,
and
as
*NL*
none
of
the
others
could
oppose
when
he
gave
way
,
there
was
no
help
for
*NL*
it
;
the
change
of
Mary
for
Anne
was
inevitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
never
submitted
more
reluctantly
to
the
jealous
and
*NL*
ill-judging
claims
of
Mary
;
but
so
it
must
be
,
and
they
set
off
for
the
*NL*
town
,
Charles
taking
care
of
his
sister
,
and
Captain
Benwick
attending
*NL*
to
her
.
She
gave
a
moment
's
recollection
,
as
they
hurried
along
,
to
*NL*
the
little
circumstances
which
the
same
spots
had
witnessed
earlier
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
There
she
had
listened
to
Henrietta
's
schemes
for
Dr
*NL*
Shirley
's
leaving
Uppercross
;
farther
on
,
she
had
first
seen
Mr
Elliot
;
*NL*
a
moment
seemed
all
that
could
now
be
given
to
any
one
but
Louisa
,
or
*NL*
those
who
were
wrapt
up
in
her
welfare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Benwick
was
most
considerately
attentive
to
her
;
and
,
united
as
*NL*
they
all
seemed
by
the
distress
of
the
day
,
she
felt
an
increasing
*NL*
degree
of
good-will
towards
him
,
and
a
pleasure
even
in
thinking
that
*NL*
it
might
,
perhaps
,
be
the
occasion
of
continuing
their
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
was
on
the
watch
for
them
,
and
a
chaise
and
four
in
*NL*
waiting
,
stationed
for
their
convenience
in
the
lowest
part
of
the
*NL*
street
;
but
his
evident
surprise
and
vexation
at
the
substitution
of
*NL*
one
sister
for
the
other
,
the
change
in
his
countenance
,
the
*NL*
astonishment
,
the
expressions
begun
and
suppressed
,
with
which
Charles
*NL*
was
listened
to
,
made
but
a
mortifying
reception
of
Anne
;
or
must
at
*NL*
least
convince
her
that
she
was
valued
only
as
she
could
be
useful
to
*NL*
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
endeavoured
to
be
composed
,
and
to
be
just
.
Without
emulating
the
*NL*
feelings
of
an
Emma
towards
her
Henry
,
she
would
have
attended
on
*NL*
Louisa
with
a
zeal
above
the
common
claims
of
regard
,
for
his
sake
;
and
*NL*
she
hoped
he
would
not
long
be
so
unjust
as
to
suppose
she
would
shrink
*NL*
unnecessarily
from
the
office
of
a
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
she
was
in
the
carriage
.
He
had
handed
them
both
in
,
*NL*
and
placed
himself
between
them
;
and
in
this
manner
,
under
these
*NL*
circumstances
,
full
of
astonishment
and
emotion
to
Anne
,
she
quitted
*NL*
Lyme
.
How
the
long
stage
would
pass
;
how
it
was
to
affect
their
*NL*
manners
;
what
was
to
be
their
sort
of
intercourse
,
she
could
not
*NL*
foresee
.
It
was
all
quite
natural
,
however
.
He
was
devoted
to
*NL*
Henrietta
;
always
turning
towards
her
;
and
when
he
spoke
at
all
,
always
*NL*
with
the
view
of
supporting
her
hopes
and
raising
her
spirits
.
In
*NL*
general
,
his
voice
and
manner
were
studiously
calm
.
To
spare
Henrietta
*NL*
from
agitation
seemed
the
governing
principle
.
Once
only
,
when
she
had
*NL*
been
grieving
over
the
last
ill-judged
,
ill-fated
walk
to
the
Cobb
,
*NL*
bitterly
lamenting
that
it
ever
had
been
thought
of
,
he
burst
forth
,
as
*NL*
if
wholly
overcome
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
of
it
,
do
n't
talk
of
it
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Oh
God
!
that
I
had
*NL*
not
given
way
to
her
at
the
fatal
moment
!
Had
I
done
as
I
ought
!
But
*NL*
so
eager
and
so
resolute
!
Dear
,
sweet
Louisa
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
wondered
whether
it
ever
occurred
to
him
now
,
to
question
the
*NL*
justness
of
his
own
previous
opinion
as
to
the
universal
felicity
and
*NL*
advantage
of
firmness
of
character
;
and
whether
it
might
not
strike
him
*NL*
that
,
like
all
other
qualities
of
the
mind
,
it
should
have
its
*NL*
proportions
and
limits
.
She
thought
it
could
scarcely
escape
him
to
*NL*
feel
that
a
persuadable
temper
might
sometimes
be
as
much
in
favour
of
*NL*
happiness
as
a
very
resolute
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
got
on
fast
.
Anne
was
astonished
to
recognise
the
same
hills
and
*NL*
the
same
objects
so
soon
.
Their
actual
speed
,
heightened
by
some
dread
*NL*
of
the
conclusion
,
made
the
road
appear
but
half
as
long
as
on
the
day
*NL*
before
.
It
was
growing
quite
dusk
,
however
,
before
they
were
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
Uppercross
,
and
there
had
been
total
silence
among
*NL*
them
for
some
time
,
Henrietta
leaning
back
in
the
corner
,
with
a
shawl
*NL*
over
her
face
,
giving
the
hope
of
her
having
cried
herself
to
sleep
;
*NL*
when
,
as
they
were
going
up
their
last
hill
,
Anne
found
herself
all
at
*NL*
once
addressed
by
Captain
Wentworth
.
In
a
low
,
cautious
voice
,
he
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
considering
what
we
had
best
do
.
She
must
not
appear
at
*NL*
first
.
She
could
not
stand
it
.
I
have
been
thinking
whether
you
had
*NL*
not
better
remain
in
the
carriage
with
her
,
while
I
go
in
and
break
it
*NL*
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
.
Do
you
think
this
is
a
good
plan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
:
he
was
satisfied
,
and
said
no
more
.
But
the
remembrance
of
*NL*
the
appeal
remained
a
pleasure
to
her
,
as
a
proof
of
friendship
,
and
of
*NL*
deference
for
her
judgement
,
a
great
pleasure
;
and
when
it
became
a
*NL*
sort
of
parting
proof
,
its
value
did
not
lessen
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
distressing
communication
at
Uppercross
was
over
,
and
he
had
*NL*
seen
the
father
and
mother
quite
as
composed
as
could
be
hoped
,
and
the
*NL*
daughter
all
the
better
for
being
with
them
,
he
announced
his
intention
*NL*
of
returning
in
the
same
carriage
to
Lyme
;
and
when
the
horses
were
*NL*
baited
,
he
was
off
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
remainder
of
Anne
's
time
at
Uppercross
,
comprehending
only
two
*NL*
days
,
was
spent
entirely
at
the
Mansion
House
;
and
she
had
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
knowing
herself
extremely
useful
there
,
both
as
an
*NL*
immediate
companion
,
and
as
assisting
in
all
those
arrangements
for
the
*NL*
future
,
which
,
in
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
distressed
state
of
spirits
,
*NL*
would
have
been
difficulties
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
an
early
account
from
Lyme
the
next
morning
.
Louisa
was
much
*NL*
the
same
.
No
symptoms
worse
than
before
had
appeared
.
Charles
came
a
*NL*
few
hours
afterwards
,
to
bring
a
later
and
more
particular
account
.
He
*NL*
was
tolerably
cheerful
.
A
speedy
cure
must
not
be
hoped
,
but
*NL*
everything
was
going
on
as
well
as
the
nature
of
the
case
admitted
.
In
*NL*
speaking
of
the
Harvilles
,
he
seemed
unable
to
satisfy
his
own
sense
of
*NL*
their
kindness
,
especially
of
Mrs
Harville
's
exertions
as
a
nurse
.
*NL*
``
She
really
left
nothing
for
Mary
to
do
.
He
and
Mary
had
been
*NL*
persuaded
to
go
early
to
their
inn
last
night
.
Mary
had
been
*NL*
hysterical
again
this
morning
.
When
he
came
away
,
she
was
going
to
*NL*
walk
out
with
Captain
Benwick
,
which
,
he
hoped
,
would
do
her
good
.
He
*NL*
almost
wished
she
had
been
prevailed
on
to
come
home
the
day
before
;
*NL*
but
the
truth
was
,
that
Mrs
Harville
left
nothing
for
anybody
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
was
to
return
to
Lyme
the
same
afternoon
,
and
his
father
had
at
*NL*
first
half
a
mind
to
go
with
him
,
but
the
ladies
could
not
consent
.
It
*NL*
would
be
going
only
to
multiply
trouble
to
the
others
,
and
increase
his
*NL*
own
distress
;
and
a
much
better
scheme
followed
and
was
acted
upon
.
A
*NL*
chaise
was
sent
for
from
Crewkherne
,
and
Charles
conveyed
back
a
far
*NL*
more
useful
person
in
the
old
nursery-maid
of
the
family
,
one
who
*NL*
having
brought
up
all
the
children
,
and
seen
the
very
last
,
the
*NL*
lingering
and
long-petted
Master
Harry
,
sent
to
school
after
his
*NL*
brothers
,
was
now
living
in
her
deserted
nursery
to
mend
stockings
and
*NL*
dress
all
the
blains
and
bruises
she
could
get
near
her
,
and
who
,
*NL*
consequently
,
was
only
too
happy
in
being
allowed
to
go
and
help
nurse
*NL*
dear
Miss
Louisa
.
Vague
wishes
of
getting
Sarah
thither
,
had
occurred
*NL*
before
to
Mrs
Musgrove
and
Henrietta
;
but
without
Anne
,
it
would
hardly
*NL*
have
been
resolved
on
,
and
found
practicable
so
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
indebted
,
the
next
day
,
to
Charles
Hayter
,
for
all
the
minute
*NL*
knowledge
of
Louisa
,
which
it
was
so
essential
to
obtain
every
*NL*
twenty-four
hours
.
He
made
it
his
business
to
go
to
Lyme
,
and
his
*NL*
account
was
still
encouraging
.
The
intervals
of
sense
and
*NL*
consciousness
were
believed
to
be
stronger
.
Every
report
agreed
in
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
's
appearing
fixed
in
Lyme
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
to
leave
them
on
the
morrow
,
an
event
which
they
all
dreaded
.
*NL*
``
What
should
they
do
without
her
?
They
were
wretched
comforters
for
*NL*
one
another
.
''
And
so
much
was
said
in
this
way
,
that
Anne
thought
she
*NL*
could
not
do
better
than
impart
among
them
the
general
inclination
to
*NL*
which
she
was
privy
,
and
persuaded
them
all
to
go
to
Lyme
at
once
.
She
*NL*
had
little
difficulty
;
it
was
soon
determined
that
they
would
go
;
go
*NL*
to-morrow
,
fix
themselves
at
the
inn
,
or
get
into
lodgings
,
as
it
*NL*
suited
,
and
there
remain
till
dear
Louisa
could
be
moved
.
They
must
be
*NL*
taking
off
some
trouble
from
the
good
people
she
was
with
;
they
might
*NL*
at
least
relieve
Mrs
Harville
from
the
care
of
her
own
children
;
and
in
*NL*
short
,
they
were
so
happy
in
the
decision
,
that
Anne
was
delighted
with
*NL*
what
she
had
done
,
and
felt
that
she
could
not
spend
her
last
morning
*NL*
at
Uppercross
better
than
in
assisting
their
preparations
,
and
sending
*NL*
them
off
at
an
early
hour
,
though
her
being
left
to
the
solitary
range
*NL*
of
the
house
was
the
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
the
last
,
excepting
the
little
boys
at
the
cottage
,
she
was
the
*NL*
very
last
,
the
only
remaining
one
of
all
that
had
filled
and
animated
*NL*
both
houses
,
of
all
that
had
given
Uppercross
its
cheerful
character
.
*NL*
A
few
days
had
made
a
change
indeed
!
*NL*
*NL*
If
Louisa
recovered
,
it
would
all
be
well
again
.
More
than
former
*NL*
happiness
would
be
restored
.
There
could
not
be
a
doubt
,
to
her
mind
*NL*
there
was
none
,
of
what
would
follow
her
recovery
.
A
few
months
hence
,
*NL*
and
the
room
now
so
deserted
,
occupied
but
by
her
silent
,
pensive
self
,
*NL*
might
be
filled
again
with
all
that
was
happy
and
gay
,
all
that
was
*NL*
glowing
and
bright
in
prosperous
love
,
all
that
was
most
unlike
Anne
*NL*
Elliot
!
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
's
complete
leisure
for
such
reflections
as
these
,
on
a
dark
*NL*
November
day
,
a
small
thick
rain
almost
blotting
out
the
very
few
*NL*
objects
ever
to
be
discerned
from
the
windows
,
was
enough
to
make
the
*NL*
sound
of
Lady
Russell
's
carriage
exceedingly
welcome
;
and
yet
,
though
*NL*
desirous
to
be
gone
,
she
could
not
quit
the
Mansion
House
,
or
look
an
*NL*
adieu
to
the
Cottage
,
with
its
black
,
dripping
and
comfortless
veranda
,
*NL*
or
even
notice
through
the
misty
glasses
the
last
humble
tenements
of
*NL*
the
village
,
without
a
saddened
heart
.
Scenes
had
passed
in
Uppercross
*NL*
which
made
it
precious
.
It
stood
the
record
of
many
sensations
of
*NL*
pain
,
once
severe
,
but
now
softened
;
and
of
some
instances
of
relenting
*NL*
feeling
,
some
breathings
of
friendship
and
reconciliation
,
which
could
*NL*
never
be
looked
for
again
,
and
which
could
never
cease
to
be
dear
.
She
*NL*
left
it
all
behind
her
,
all
but
the
recollection
that
such
things
had
*NL*
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
never
entered
Kellynch
since
her
quitting
Lady
Russell
's
house
*NL*
in
September
.
It
had
not
been
necessary
,
and
the
few
occasions
of
its
*NL*
being
possible
for
her
to
go
to
the
Hall
she
had
contrived
to
evade
and
*NL*
escape
from
.
Her
first
return
was
to
resume
her
place
in
the
modern
*NL*
and
elegant
apartments
of
the
Lodge
,
and
to
gladden
the
eyes
of
its
*NL*
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
anxiety
mixed
with
Lady
Russell
's
joy
in
meeting
her
.
*NL*
She
knew
who
had
been
frequenting
Uppercross
.
But
happily
,
either
Anne
*NL*
was
improved
in
plumpness
and
looks
,
or
Lady
Russell
fancied
her
so
;
*NL*
and
Anne
,
in
receiving
her
compliments
on
the
occasion
,
had
the
*NL*
amusement
of
connecting
them
with
the
silent
admiration
of
her
cousin
,
*NL*
and
of
hoping
that
she
was
to
be
blessed
with
a
second
spring
of
youth
*NL*
and
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
came
to
converse
,
she
was
soon
sensible
of
some
mental
*NL*
change
.
The
subjects
of
which
her
heart
had
been
full
on
leaving
*NL*
Kellynch
,
and
which
she
had
felt
slighted
,
and
been
compelled
to
*NL*
smother
among
the
Musgroves
,
were
now
become
but
of
secondary
interest
.
*NL*
She
had
lately
lost
sight
even
of
her
father
and
sister
and
Bath
.
*NL*
Their
concerns
had
been
sunk
under
those
of
Uppercross
;
and
when
Lady
*NL*
Russell
reverted
to
their
former
hopes
and
fears
,
and
spoke
her
*NL*
satisfaction
in
the
house
in
Camden
Place
,
which
had
been
taken
,
and
*NL*
her
regret
that
Mrs
Clay
should
still
be
with
them
,
Anne
would
have
*NL*
been
ashamed
to
have
it
known
how
much
more
she
was
thinking
of
Lyme
*NL*
and
Louisa
Musgrove
,
and
all
her
acquaintance
there
;
how
much
more
*NL*
interesting
to
her
was
the
home
and
the
friendship
of
the
Harvilles
and
*NL*
Captain
Benwick
,
than
her
own
father
's
house
in
Camden
Place
,
or
her
*NL*
own
sister
's
intimacy
with
Mrs
Clay
.
She
was
actually
forced
to
exert
*NL*
herself
to
meet
Lady
Russell
with
anything
like
the
appearance
of
equal
*NL*
solicitude
,
on
topics
which
had
by
nature
the
first
claim
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
awkwardness
at
first
in
their
discourse
on
another
*NL*
subject
.
They
must
speak
of
the
accident
at
Lyme
.
Lady
Russell
had
*NL*
not
been
arrived
five
minutes
the
day
before
,
when
a
full
account
of
*NL*
the
whole
had
burst
on
her
;
but
still
it
must
be
talked
of
,
she
must
*NL*
make
enquiries
,
she
must
regret
the
imprudence
,
lament
the
result
,
and
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
's
name
must
be
mentioned
by
both
.
Anne
was
conscious
*NL*
of
not
doing
it
so
well
as
Lady
Russell
.
She
could
not
speak
the
name
,
*NL*
and
look
straight
forward
to
Lady
Russell
's
eye
,
till
she
had
adopted
*NL*
the
expedient
of
telling
her
briefly
what
she
thought
of
the
attachment
*NL*
between
him
and
Louisa
.
When
this
was
told
,
his
name
distressed
her
no
*NL*
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
had
only
to
listen
composedly
,
and
wish
them
happy
,
but
*NL*
internally
her
heart
revelled
in
angry
pleasure
,
in
pleased
contempt
,
*NL*
that
the
man
who
at
twenty-three
had
seemed
to
understand
somewhat
of
*NL*
the
value
of
an
Anne
Elliot
,
should
,
eight
years
afterwards
,
be
charmed
*NL*
by
a
Louisa
Musgrove
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
three
or
four
days
passed
most
quietly
,
with
no
circumstance
*NL*
to
mark
them
excepting
the
receipt
of
a
note
or
two
from
Lyme
,
which
*NL*
found
their
way
to
Anne
,
she
could
not
tell
how
,
and
brought
a
rather
*NL*
improving
account
of
Louisa
.
At
the
end
of
that
period
,
Lady
Russell
's
*NL*
politeness
could
repose
no
longer
,
and
the
fainter
self-threatenings
of
*NL*
the
past
became
in
a
decided
tone
,
``
I
must
call
on
Mrs
Croft
;
I
really
*NL*
must
call
upon
her
soon
.
Anne
,
have
you
courage
to
go
with
me
,
and
pay
*NL*
a
visit
in
that
house
?
It
will
be
some
trial
to
us
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
did
not
shrink
from
it
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
truly
felt
as
she
*NL*
said
,
in
observing
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
very
likely
to
suffer
the
most
of
the
two
;
your
*NL*
feelings
are
less
reconciled
to
the
change
than
mine
.
By
remaining
in
*NL*
the
neighbourhood
,
I
am
become
inured
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
have
said
more
on
the
subject
;
for
she
had
in
fact
so
high
an
*NL*
opinion
of
the
Crofts
,
and
considered
her
father
so
very
fortunate
in
*NL*
his
tenants
,
felt
the
parish
to
be
so
sure
of
a
good
example
,
and
the
*NL*
poor
of
the
best
attention
and
relief
,
that
however
sorry
and
ashamed
*NL*
for
the
necessity
of
the
removal
,
she
could
not
but
in
conscience
feel
*NL*
that
they
were
gone
who
deserved
not
to
stay
,
and
that
Kellynch
Hall
*NL*
had
passed
into
better
hands
than
its
owners
'
.
These
convictions
must
*NL*
unquestionably
have
their
own
pain
,
and
severe
was
its
kind
;
but
they
*NL*
precluded
that
pain
which
Lady
Russell
would
suffer
in
entering
the
*NL*
house
again
,
and
returning
through
the
well-known
apartments
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
moments
Anne
had
no
power
of
saying
to
herself
,
``
These
rooms
*NL*
ought
to
belong
only
to
us
.
Oh
,
how
fallen
in
their
destination
!
How
*NL*
unworthily
occupied
!
An
ancient
family
to
be
so
driven
away
!
*NL*
Strangers
filling
their
place
!
''
No
,
except
when
she
thought
of
her
*NL*
mother
,
and
remembered
where
she
had
been
used
to
sit
and
preside
,
she
*NL*
had
no
sigh
of
that
description
to
heave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Croft
always
met
her
with
a
kindness
which
gave
her
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
fancying
herself
a
favourite
,
and
on
the
present
occasion
,
receiving
*NL*
her
in
that
house
,
there
was
particular
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sad
accident
at
Lyme
was
soon
the
prevailing
topic
,
and
on
*NL*
comparing
their
latest
accounts
of
the
invalid
,
it
appeared
that
each
*NL*
lady
dated
her
intelligence
from
the
same
hour
of
yestermorn
;
that
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
had
been
in
Kellynch
yesterday
-LRB-
the
first
time
since
*NL*
the
accident
-RRB-
,
had
brought
Anne
the
last
note
,
which
she
had
not
been
*NL*
able
to
trace
the
exact
steps
of
;
had
staid
a
few
hours
and
then
*NL*
returned
again
to
Lyme
,
and
without
any
present
intention
of
quitting
*NL*
it
any
more
.
He
had
enquired
after
her
,
she
found
,
particularly
;
had
*NL*
expressed
his
hope
of
Miss
Elliot
's
not
being
the
worse
for
her
*NL*
exertions
,
and
had
spoken
of
those
exertions
as
great
.
This
was
*NL*
handsome
,
and
gave
her
more
pleasure
than
almost
anything
else
could
*NL*
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
sad
catastrophe
itself
,
it
could
be
canvassed
only
in
one
*NL*
style
by
a
couple
of
steady
,
sensible
women
,
whose
judgements
had
to
*NL*
work
on
ascertained
events
;
and
it
was
perfectly
decided
that
it
had
*NL*
been
the
consequence
of
much
thoughtlessness
and
much
imprudence
;
that
*NL*
its
effects
were
most
alarming
,
and
that
it
was
frightful
to
think
,
how
*NL*
long
Miss
Musgrove
's
recovery
might
yet
be
doubtful
,
and
how
liable
she
*NL*
would
still
remain
to
suffer
from
the
concussion
hereafter
!
The
*NL*
Admiral
wound
it
up
summarily
by
exclaiming
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
a
very
bad
business
indeed
.
A
new
sort
of
way
this
,
for
a
young
*NL*
fellow
to
be
making
love
,
by
breaking
his
mistress
's
head
,
is
not
it
,
*NL*
Miss
Elliot
?
This
is
breaking
a
head
and
giving
a
plaster
,
truly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Admiral
Croft
's
manners
were
not
quite
of
the
tone
to
suit
Lady
*NL*
Russell
,
but
they
delighted
Anne
.
His
goodness
of
heart
and
simplicity
*NL*
of
character
were
irresistible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
this
must
be
very
bad
for
you
,
''
said
he
,
suddenly
rousing
from
a
*NL*
little
reverie
,
``
to
be
coming
and
finding
us
here
.
I
had
not
*NL*
recollected
it
before
,
I
declare
,
but
it
must
be
very
bad
.
But
now
,
do
*NL*
not
stand
upon
ceremony
.
Get
up
and
go
over
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
*NL*
if
you
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
time
,
Sir

I
thank
you
,
not
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
whenever
it
suits
you
.
You
can
slip
in
from
the
shrubbery
at
*NL*
any
time
;
and
there
you
will
find
we
keep
our
umbrellas
hanging
up
by
*NL*
that
door
.
A
good
place
is
not
it
?
But
,
''
-LRB-
checking
himself
-RRB-
,
``
you
*NL*
will
not
think
it
a
good
place

yours

always
kept
in
the
*NL*
butler

room

Ay
,
so
it
always
is
,
I
believe
.
One
man
's
ways
may
be
*NL*
as
good
as
another
's
,
but
we
all
like
our
own
best
.
And
so
you
must
*NL*
judge
for
yourself
,
whether
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
go
about
the
*NL*
house
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
,
finding
she
might
decline
it
,
did
so
,
very
gratefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
made
very
few
changes
either
,
''
continued
the
Admiral
,
after
*NL*
thinking
a
moment
.
``
Very
few
.
We
told
you
about
the
laundry-door
,
at
*NL*
Uppercross
.
That
has
been
a
very
great
improvement
.
The
wonder
was
,
*NL*
how
any
family
upon
earth
could
bear
with
the
inconvenience
of
its
*NL*
opening
as
it
did
,
so
long
!
You
will
tell
Sir
Walter
what
we
have
*NL*
done
,
and
that
Mr
Shepherd
thinks
it
the
greatest
improvement
the
house
*NL*
ever
had
.
Indeed
,
I
must
do
ourselves
the
justice
to
say
,
that
the
few
*NL*
alterations
we
have
made
have
been
all
very
much
for
the
better
.
My
*NL*
wife
should
have
the
credit
of
them
,
however
.
I
have
done
very
little
*NL*
besides
sending
away
some
of
the
large
looking-glasses
from
my
*NL*
dressing-room
,
which
was
your
father
's
.
A
very
good
man
,
and
very
much
*NL*
the
gentleman
I
am
sure
:
but
I
should
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
''
-LRB-
looking
*NL*
with
serious
reflection
-RRB-
,
``
I
should
think
he
must
be
rather
a
dressy
*NL*
man
for
his
time
of
life
.
Such
a
number
of
looking-glasses
!
oh
Lord
!
*NL*
there
was
no
getting
away
from
one
's
self
.
So
I
got
Sophy
to
lend
me
a
*NL*
hand
,
and
we
soon
shifted
their
quarters
;
and
now
I
am
quite
snug
,
with
*NL*
my
little
shaving
glass
in
one
corner
,
and
another
great
thing
that
I
*NL*
never
go
near
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
,
amused
in
spite
of
herself
,
was
rather
distressed
for
an
answer
,
*NL*
and
the
Admiral
,
fearing
he
might
not
have
been
civil
enough
,
took
up
*NL*
the
subject
again
,
to
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
time
you
write
to
your
good
father
,
Miss
Elliot
,
pray
give
*NL*
him
my
compliments
and
Mrs
Croft
's
,
and
say
that
we
are
settled
here
*NL*
quite
to
our
liking
,
and
have
no
fault
at
all
to
find
with
the
place
.
*NL*
The
breakfast-room
chimney
smokes
a
little
,
I
grant
you
,
but
it
is
only
*NL*
when
the
wind
is
due
north
and
blows
hard
,
which
may
not
happen
three
*NL*
times
a
winter
.
And
take
it
altogether
,
now
that
we
have
been
into
*NL*
most
of
the
houses
hereabouts
and
can
judge
,
there
is
not
one
that
we
*NL*
like
better
than
this
.
Pray
say
so
,
with
my
compliments

He
will
be
*NL*
glad
to
hear
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
and
Mrs
Croft
were
very
well
pleased
with
each
other
:
but
*NL*
the
acquaintance
which
this
visit
began
was
fated
not
to
proceed
far
at
*NL*
present
;
for
when
it
was
returned
,
the
Crofts
announced
themselves
to
*NL*
be
going
away
for
a
few
weeks
,
to
visit
their
connexions
in
the
north
*NL*
of
the
county
,
and
probably
might
not
be
at
home
again
before
Lady
*NL*
Russell
would
be
removing
to
Bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
ended
all
danger
to
Anne
of
meeting
Captain
Wentworth
at
Kellynch
*NL*
Hall
,
or
of
seeing
him
in
company
with
her
friend
.
Everything
was
safe
*NL*
enough
,
and
she
smiled
over
the
many
anxious
feelings
she
had
wasted
on
*NL*
the
subject
.

Chapter
14
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Charles
and
Mary
had
remained
at
Lyme
much
longer
after
Mr
and
*NL*
Mrs
Musgrove
's
going
than
Anne
conceived
they
could
have
been
at
all
*NL*
wanted
,
they
were
yet
the
first
of
the
family
to
be
at
home
again
;
and
*NL*
as
soon
as
possible
after
their
return
to
Uppercross
they
drove
over
to
*NL*
the
Lodge
.
They
had
left
Louisa
beginning
to
sit
up
;
but
her
head
,
*NL*
though
clear
,
was
exceedingly
weak
,
and
her
nerves
susceptible
to
the
*NL*
highest
extreme
of
tenderness
;
and
though
she
might
be
pronounced
to
be
*NL*
altogether
doing
very
well
,
it
was
still
impossible
to
say
when
she
*NL*
might
be
able
to
bear
the
removal
home
;
and
her
father
and
mother
,
who
*NL*
must
return
in
time
to
receive
their
younger
children
for
the
Christmas
*NL*
holidays
,
had
hardly
a
hope
of
being
allowed
to
bring
her
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
been
all
in
lodgings
together
.
Mrs
Musgrove
had
got
Mrs
*NL*
Harville
's
children
away
as
much
as
she
could
,
every
possible
supply
*NL*
from
Uppercross
had
been
furnished
,
to
lighten
the
inconvenience
to
the
*NL*
Harvilles
,
while
the
Harvilles
had
been
wanting
them
to
come
to
dinner
*NL*
every
day
;
and
in
short
,
it
seemed
to
have
been
only
a
struggle
on
each
*NL*
side
as
to
which
should
be
most
disinterested
and
hospitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
had
her
evils
;
but
upon
the
whole
,
as
was
evident
by
her
*NL*
staying
so
long
,
she
had
found
more
to
enjoy
than
to
suffer
.
Charles
*NL*
Hayter
had
been
at
Lyme
oftener
than
suited
her
;
and
when
they
dined
*NL*
with
the
Harvilles
there
had
been
only
a
maid-servant
to
wait
,
and
at
*NL*
first
Mrs
Harville
had
always
given
Mrs
Musgrove
precedence
;
but
then
,
*NL*
she
had
received
so
very
handsome
an
apology
from
her
on
finding
out
*NL*
whose
daughter
she
was
,
and
there
had
been
so
much
going
on
every
day
,
*NL*
there
had
been
so
many
walks
between
their
lodgings
and
the
Harvilles
,
*NL*
and
she
had
got
books
from
the
library
,
and
changed
them
so
often
,
that
*NL*
the
balance
had
certainly
been
much
in
favour
of
Lyme
.
She
had
been
*NL*
taken
to
Charmouth
too
,
and
she
had
bathed
,
and
she
had
gone
to
church
,
*NL*
and
there
were
a
great
many
more
people
to
look
at
in
the
church
at
*NL*
Lyme
than
at
Uppercross
;
and
all
this
,
joined
to
the
sense
of
being
so
*NL*
very
useful
,
had
made
really
an
agreeable
fortnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
enquired
after
Captain
Benwick
.
Mary
's
face
was
clouded
directly
.
*NL*
Charles
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Captain
Benwick
is
very
well
,
I
believe
,
but
he
is
a
very
odd
*NL*
young
man
.
I
do
not
know
what
he
would
be
at
.
We
asked
him
to
come
*NL*
home
with
us
for
a
day
or
two
:
Charles
undertook
to
give
him
some
*NL*
shooting
,
and
he
seemed
quite
delighted
,
and
,
for
my
part
,
I
thought
it
*NL*
was
all
settled
;
when
behold
!
on
Tuesday
night
,
he
made
a
very
awkward
*NL*
sort
of
excuse
;
`
he
never
shot
'
and
he
had
`
been
quite
misunderstood
,
'
*NL*
and
he
had
promised
this
and
he
had
promised
that
,
and
the
end
of
it
*NL*
was
,
I
found
,
that
he
did
not
mean
to
come
.
I
suppose
he
was
afraid
of
*NL*
finding
it
dull
;
but
upon
my
word
I
should
have
thought
we
were
lively
*NL*
enough
at
the
Cottage
for
such
a
heart-broken
man
as
Captain
Benwick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
laughed
again
and
said
,
``
Now
Mary
,
you
know
very
well
how
it
*NL*
really
was
.
It
was
all
your
doing
,
''
-LRB-
turning
to
Anne
.
-RRB-
``
He
fancied
*NL*
that
if
he
went
with
us
,
he
should
find
you
close
by
:
he
fancied
*NL*
everybody
to
be
living
in
Uppercross
;
and
when
he
discovered
that
Lady
*NL*
Russell
lived
three
miles
off
,
his
heart
failed
him
,
and
he
had
not
*NL*
courage
to
come
.
That
is
the
fact
,
upon
my
honour
.
Mary
knows
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mary
did
not
give
into
it
very
graciously
,
whether
from
not
*NL*
considering
Captain
Benwick
entitled
by
birth
and
situation
to
be
in
*NL*
love
with
an
Elliot
,
or
from
not
wanting
to
believe
Anne
a
greater
*NL*
attraction
to
Uppercross
than
herself
,
must
be
left
to
be
guessed
.
*NL*
Anne
's
good-will
,
however
,
was
not
to
be
lessened
by
what
she
heard
.
*NL*
She
boldly
acknowledged
herself
flattered
,
and
continued
her
enquiries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
he
talks
of
you
,
''
cried
Charles
,
``
in
such
terms
--
''
Mary
*NL*
interrupted
him
.
``
I
declare
,
Charles
,
I
never
heard
him
mention
Anne
*NL*
twice
all
the
time
I
was
there
.
I
declare
,
Anne
,
he
never
talks
of
you
*NL*
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
admitted
Charles
,
``
I
do
not
know
that
he
ever
does
,
in
a
general
*NL*
way
;
but
however
,
it
is
a
very
clear
thing
that
he
admires
you
*NL*
exceedingly
.
His
head
is
full
of
some
books
that
he
is
reading
upon
*NL*
your
recommendation
,
and
he
wants
to
talk
to
you
about
them
;
he
has
*NL*
found
out
something
or
other
in
one
of
them
which
he
thinks
--
oh
!
I
*NL*
can
not
pretend
to
remember
it
,
but
it
was
something
very
fine
--
I
*NL*
overheard
him
telling
Henrietta
all
about
it
;
and
then
`
Miss
Elliot
'
*NL*
was
spoken
of
in
the
highest
terms
!
Now
Mary
,
I
declare
it
was
so
,
I
*NL*
heard
it
myself
,

you
were
in
the
other
room

`
Elegance

sweetness

*NL*
beauty

Oh

there
was
no
end
of
Miss
Elliot
's
charms

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
sure

''
cried
Mary
,
warmly
,
``
it
was
a
very
little
to
his
*NL*
credit
,
if
he
did

Miss
Harville
only
died
last
June
.
Such
a
heart
is
*NL*
very
little
worth
having
;
is
it
,
Lady
Russell
?
I
am
sure
you
will
*NL*
agree
with
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
see
Captain

before
I
decide

Lady

*NL*
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
you
are
very
likely
to
do

soon

I
can
tell
you

*NL*
said
Charles
.
``
Though
he
had
not
nerves
for
coming
away
with

*NL*
setting
off
again
afterwards
to

visit
here

he
will
make

his

over
to
Kellynch
one
day
by
himself

you
may
depend
on

I
*NL*
told
him
the
distance
and
the
road
,
and
I
told
him
of
the
church

being
so
very
well
worth
seeing

he
has
a
taste
for

I
thought
that
would
be
a
good
excuse

he
listened

all
his
understanding

soul
;

I
am
sure
from
his
manner
that
you

will
have

calling
here
soon

give
you
notice

You

a
*NL*
word
.
He
is
not
at
all
a
well-bred
young
man
.
I
am
sure
you
will
not
*NL*
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
we
differ
,
Mary
,
''
said
Anne
.
``
I
think
Lady
Russell
would
like
*NL*
him
.
I
think
she
would
be
so
much
pleased
with
his
mind
,
that
she
*NL*
would
very
soon
see
no
deficiency
in
his
manner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
,
Anne
,
''
said
Charles
.
``
I
am
sure
Lady
Russell
would
like
him
.
*NL*
He
is
just
Lady
Russell
's
sort
.
Give
him
a
book
,
and
he
will
read
all
*NL*
day
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
he
will
!
''
exclaimed
Mary
,
tauntingly
.
``
He
will
sit
poring
*NL*
over
his
book
,
and
not
know
when
a
person
speaks
to
him
,
or
when
one
*NL*
drops
one
's
scissors
,
or
anything
that
happens
.
Do
you
think
Lady
*NL*
Russell
would
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
could
not
help
laughing
.
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
*NL*
should
not
have
supposed
that
my
opinion
of
any
one
could
have
admitted
*NL*
of
such
difference
of
conjecture
,
steady
and
matter
of
fact
as
I
may
*NL*
call
myself
.
I
have
really
a
curiosity
to
see
the
person
who
can
give
*NL*
occasion
to
such
directly
opposite
notions
.
I
wish
he
may
be
induced
*NL*
to
call
here
.
And
when
he
does
,
Mary
,
you
may
depend
upon
hearing
my
*NL*
opinion
;
but
I
am
determined
not
to
judge
him
beforehand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
like
him
,
I
will
answer
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
began
talking
of
something
else
.
Mary
spoke
with
*NL*
animation
of
their
meeting
with
,
or
rather
missing
,
Mr
Elliot
so
*NL*
extraordinarily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
man
,
''
said
Lady
Russell
,
``
whom
I
have
no
wish
to
see
.
His
*NL*
declining
to
be
on
cordial
terms
with
the
head
of
his
family
,
has
left
*NL*
a
very
strong
impression
in
his
disfavour
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
decision
checked
Mary
's
eagerness
,
and
stopped
her
short
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
Elliot
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
Captain
Wentworth
,
though
Anne
hazarded
no
enquiries
,
*NL*
there
was
voluntary
communication
sufficient
.
His
spirits
had
been
*NL*
greatly
recovering
lately
as
might
be
expected
.
As
Louisa
improved
,
he
*NL*
had
improved
,
and
he
was
now
quite
a
different
creature
from
what
he
*NL*
had
been
the
first
week
.
He
had
not
seen
Louisa
;
and
was
so
extremely
*NL*
fearful
of
any
ill
consequence
to
her
from
an
interview
,
that
he
did
*NL*
not
press
for
it
at
all
;
and
,
on
the
contrary
,
seemed
to
have
a
plan
of
*NL*
going
away
for
a
week
or
ten
days
,
till
her
head
was
stronger
.
He
had
*NL*
talked
of
going
down
to
Plymouth
for
a
week
,
and
wanted
to
persuade
*NL*
Captain
Benwick
to
go
with
him
;
but
,
as
Charles
maintained
to
the
last
,
*NL*
Captain
Benwick
seemed
much
more
disposed
to
ride
over
to
Kellynch
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
Lady
Russell
and
Anne
were
both
occasionally
*NL*
thinking
of
Captain
Benwick
,
from
this
time
.
Lady
Russell
could
not
*NL*
hear
the
door-bell
without
feeling
that
it
might
be
his
herald
;
nor
*NL*
could
Anne
return
from
any
stroll
of
solitary
indulgence
in
her
*NL*
father
's
grounds
,
or
any
visit
of
charity
in
the
village
,
without
*NL*
wondering
whether
she
might
see
him
or
hear
of
him
.
Captain
Benwick
*NL*
came
not
,
however
.
He
was
either
less
disposed
for
it
than
Charles
had
*NL*
imagined
,
or
he
was
too
shy
;
and
after
giving
him
a
week
's
indulgence
,
*NL*
Lady
Russell
determined
him
to
be
unworthy
of
the
interest
which
he
had
*NL*
been
beginning
to
excite
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Musgroves
came
back
to
receive
their
happy
boys
and
girls
from
*NL*
school
,
bringing
with
them
Mrs
Harville
's
little
children
,
to
improve
*NL*
the
noise
of
Uppercross
,
and
lessen
that
of
Lyme
.
Henrietta
remained
*NL*
with
Louisa
;
but
all
the
rest
of
the
family
were
again
in
their
usual
*NL*
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
and
Anne
paid
their
compliments
to
them
once
,
when
Anne
*NL*
could
not
but
feel
that
Uppercross
was
already
quite
alive
again
.
*NL*
Though
neither
Henrietta
,
nor
Louisa
,
nor
Charles
Hayter
,
nor
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
were
there
,
the
room
presented
as
strong
a
contrast
as
could
*NL*
be
wished
to
the
last
state
she
had
seen
it
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
surrounding
Mrs
Musgrove
were
the
little
Harvilles
,
whom
*NL*
she
was
sedulously
guarding
from
the
tyranny
of
the
two
children
from
*NL*
the
Cottage
,
expressly
arrived
to
amuse
them
.
On
one
side
was
a
table
*NL*
occupied
by
some
chattering
girls
,
cutting
up
silk
and
gold
paper
;
and
*NL*
on
the
other
were
tressels
and
trays
,
bending
under
the
weight
of
brawn
*NL*
and
cold
pies
,
where
riotous
boys
were
holding
high
revel
;
the
whole
*NL*
completed
by
a
roaring
Christmas
fire
,
which
seemed
determined
to
be
*NL*
heard
,
in
spite
of
all
the
noise
of
the
others
.
Charles
and
Mary
also
*NL*
came
in
,
of
course
,
during
their
visit
,
and
Mr
Musgrove
made
a
point
of
*NL*
paying
his
respects
to
Lady
Russell
,
and
sat
down
close
to
her
for
ten
*NL*
minutes
,
talking
with
a
very
raised
voice
,
but
from
the
clamour
of
the
*NL*
children
on
his
knees
,
generally
in
vain
.
It
was
a
fine
family-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
,
judging
from
her
own
temperament
,
would
have
deemed
such
a
*NL*
domestic
hurricane
a
bad
restorative
of
the
nerves
,
which
Louisa
's
*NL*
illness
must
have
so
greatly
shaken
.
But
Mrs
Musgrove
,
who
got
Anne
*NL*
near
her
on
purpose
to
thank
her
most
cordially
,
again
and
again
,
for
*NL*
all
her
attentions
to
them
,
concluded
a
short
recapitulation
of
what
*NL*
she
had
suffered
herself
by
observing
,
with
a
happy
glance
round
the
*NL*
room
,
that
after
all
she
had
gone
through
,
nothing
was
so
likely
to
do
*NL*
her
good
as
a
little
quiet
cheerfulness
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
was
now
recovering
apace
.
Her
mother
could
even
think
of
her
*NL*
being
able
to
join
their
party
at
home
,
before
her
brothers
and
sisters
*NL*
went
to
school
again
.
The
Harvilles
had
promised
to
come
with
her
and
*NL*
stay
at
Uppercross
,
whenever
she
returned
.
Captain
Wentworth
was
gone
,
*NL*
for
the
present
,
to
see
his
brother
in
Shropshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
shall
remember
,
in
future
,
''
said
Lady
Russell
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
they
were
reseated
in
the
carriage
,
``
not
to
call
at
Uppercross
in
the
*NL*
Christmas
holidays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
has
their
taste
in
noises
as
well
as
in
other
matters
;
and
*NL*
sounds
are
quite
innoxious
,
or
most
distressing
,
by
their
sort
rather
*NL*
than
their
quantity
.
When
Lady
Russell
not
long
afterwards
,
was
*NL*
entering
Bath
on
a
wet
afternoon
,
and
driving
through
the
long
course
*NL*
of
streets
from
the
Old
Bridge
to
Camden
Place
,
amidst
the
dash
of
*NL*
other
carriages
,
the
heavy
rumble
of
carts
and
drays
,
the
bawling
of
*NL*
newspapermen
,
muffin-men
and
milkmen
,
and
the
ceaseless
clink
of
*NL*
pattens
,
she
made
no
complaint
.
No
,
these
were
noises
which
belonged
*NL*
to
the
winter
pleasures
;
her
spirits
rose
under
their
influence
;
and
*NL*
like
Mrs
Musgrove
,
she
was
feeling
,
though
not
saying
,
that
after
being
*NL*
long
in
the
country
,
nothing
could
be
so
good
for
her
as
a
little
quiet
*NL*
cheerfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
did
not
share
these
feelings
.
She
persisted
in
a
very
determined
,
*NL*
though
very
silent
disinclination
for
Bath
;
caught
the
first
dim
view
*NL*
of
the
extensive
buildings
,
smoking
in
rain
,
without
any
wish
of
seeing
*NL*
them
better
;
felt
their
progress
through
the
streets
to
be
,
however
*NL*
disagreeable
,
yet
too
rapid
;
for
who
would
be
glad
to
see
her
when
she
*NL*
arrived
?
And
looked
back
,
with
fond
regret
,
to
the
bustles
of
*NL*
Uppercross
and
the
seclusion
of
Kellynch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
last
letter
had
communicated
a
piece
of
news
of
some
*NL*
interest
.
Mr
Elliot
was
in
Bath
.
He
had
called
in
Camden
Place
;
had
*NL*
called
a
second
time
,
a
third
;
had
been
pointedly
attentive
.
If
*NL*
Elizabeth
and
her
father
did
not
deceive
themselves
,
had
been
taking
*NL*
much
pains
to
seek
the
acquaintance
,
and
proclaim
the
value
of
the
*NL*
connection
,
as
he
had
formerly
taken
pains
to
shew
neglect
.
This
was
*NL*
very
wonderful
if
it
were
true
;
and
Lady
Russell
was
in
a
state
of
very
*NL*
agreeable
curiosity
and
perplexity
about
Mr
Elliot
,
already
recanting
*NL*
the
sentiment
she
had
so
lately
expressed
to
Mary
,
of
his
being
``
a
man
*NL*
whom
she
had
no
wish
to
see
.
''
She
had
a
great
wish
to
see
him
.
If
he
*NL*
really
sought
to
reconcile
himself
like
a
dutiful
branch
,
he
must
be
*NL*
forgiven
for
having
dismembered
himself
from
the
paternal
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
not
animated
to
an
equal
pitch
by
the
circumstance
,
but
she
*NL*
felt
that
she
would
rather
see
Mr
Elliot
again
than
not
,
which
was
more
*NL*
than
she
could
say
for
many
other
persons
in
Bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
put
down
in
Camden
Place
;
and
Lady
Russell
then
drove
to
her
*NL*
own
lodgings
,
in
Rivers
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
15
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
had
taken
a
very
good
house
in
Camden
Place
,
a
lofty
*NL*
dignified
situation
,
such
as
becomes
a
man
of
consequence
;
and
both
he
*NL*
and
Elizabeth
were
settled
there
,
much
to
their
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
entered
it
with
a
sinking
heart
,
anticipating
an
imprisonment
of
*NL*
many
months
,
and
anxiously
saying
to
herself
,
``
Oh
!
when
shall
I
leave
*NL*
you
again
?
''
A
degree
of
unexpected
cordiality
,
however
,
in
the
welcome
*NL*
she
received
,
did
her
good
.
Her
father
and
sister
were
glad
to
see
*NL*
her
,
for
the
sake
of
shewing
her
the
house
and
furniture
,
and
met
her
*NL*
with
kindness
.
Her
making
a
fourth
,
when
they
sat
down
to
dinner
,
was
*NL*
noticed
as
an
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Clay
was
very
pleasant
,
and
very
smiling
,
but
her
courtesies
and
*NL*
smiles
were
more
a
matter
of
course
.
Anne
had
always
felt
that
she
*NL*
would
pretend
what
was
proper
on
her
arrival
,
but
the
complaisance
of
*NL*
the
others
was
unlooked
for
.
They
were
evidently
in
excellent
spirits
,
*NL*
and
she
was
soon
to
listen
to
the
causes
.
They
had
no
inclination
to
*NL*
listen
to
her
.
After
laying
out
for
some
compliments
of
being
deeply
*NL*
regretted
in
their
old
neighbourhood
,
which
Anne
could
not
pay
,
they
*NL*
had
only
a
few
faint
enquiries
to
make
,
before
the
talk
must
be
all
*NL*
their
own
.
Uppercross
excited
no
interest
,
Kellynch
very
little
:
it
*NL*
was
all
Bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
the
pleasure
of
assuring
her
that
Bath
more
than
answered
*NL*
their
expectations
in
every
respect
.
Their
house
was
undoubtedly
the
*NL*
best
in
Camden
Place
;
their
drawing-rooms
had
many
decided
advantages
*NL*
over
all
the
others
which
they
had
either
seen
or
heard
of
,
and
the
*NL*
superiority
was
not
less
in
the
style
of
the
fitting-up
,
or
the
taste
*NL*
of
the
furniture
.
Their
acquaintance
was
exceedingly
sought
after
.
*NL*
Everybody
was
wanting
to
visit
them
.
They
had
drawn
back
from
many
*NL*
introductions
,
and
still
were
perpetually
having
cards
left
by
people
*NL*
of
whom
they
knew
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
were
funds
of
enjoyment
.
Could
Anne
wonder
that
her
father
and
*NL*
sister
were
happy
?
She
might
not
wonder
,
but
she
must
sigh
that
her
*NL*
father
should
feel
no
degradation
in
his
change
,
should
see
nothing
to
*NL*
regret
in
the
duties
and
dignity
of
the
resident
landholder
,
should
*NL*
find
so
much
to
be
vain
of
in
the
littlenesses
of
a
town
;
and
she
must
*NL*
sigh
,
and
smile
,
and
wonder
too
,
as
Elizabeth
threw
open
the
*NL*
folding-doors
and
walked
with
exultation
from
one
drawing-room
to
the
*NL*
other
,
boasting
of
their
space
;
at
the
possibility
of
that
woman
,
who
*NL*
had
been
mistress
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
finding
extent
to
be
proud
of
*NL*
between
two
walls
,
perhaps
thirty
feet
asunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
not
all
which
they
had
to
make
them
happy
.
They
had
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
too
.
Anne
had
a
great
deal
to
hear
of
Mr
Elliot
.
He
was
not
*NL*
only
pardoned
,
they
were
delighted
with
him
.
He
had
been
in
Bath
about
*NL*
a
fortnight
;
-LRB-
he
had
passed
through
Bath
in
November
,
in
his
way
to
*NL*
London
,
when
the
intelligence
of
Sir
Walter
's
being
settled
there
had
*NL*
of
course
reached
him
,
though
only
twenty-four
hours
in
the
place
,
but
*NL*
he
had
not
been
able
to
avail
himself
of
it
;-RRB-
but
he
had
now
been
a
*NL*
fortnight
in
Bath
,
and
his
first
object
on
arriving
,
had
been
to
leave
*NL*
his
card
in
Camden
Place
,
following
it
up
by
such
assiduous
endeavours
*NL*
to
meet
,
and
when
they
did
meet
,
by
such
great
openness
of
conduct
,
*NL*
such
readiness
to
apologize
for
the
past
,
such
solicitude
to
be
*NL*
received
as
a
relation
again
,
that
their
former
good
understanding
was
*NL*
completely
re-established
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
a
fault
to
find
in
him
.
He
had
explained
away
all
the
*NL*
appearance
of
neglect
on
his
own
side
.
It
had
originated
in
*NL*
misapprehension
entirely
.
He
had
never
had
an
idea
of
throwing
himself
*NL*
off
;
he
had
feared
that
he
was
thrown
off
,
but
knew
not
why
,
and
*NL*
delicacy
had
kept
him
silent
.
Upon
the
hint
of
having
spoken
*NL*
disrespectfully
or
carelessly
of
the
family
and
the
family
honours
,
he
*NL*
was
quite
indignant
.
He
,
who
had
ever
boasted
of
being
an
Elliot
,
and
*NL*
whose
feelings
,
as
to
connection
,
were
only
too
strict
to
suit
the
*NL*
unfeudal
tone
of
the
present
day
.
He
was
astonished
,
indeed
,
but
his
*NL*
character
and
general
conduct
must
refute
it
.
He
could
refer
Sir
*NL*
Walter
to
all
who
knew
him
;
and
certainly
,
the
pains
he
had
been
taking
*NL*
on
this
,
the
first
opportunity
of
reconciliation
,
to
be
restored
to
the
*NL*
footing
of
a
relation
and
heir-presumptive
,
was
a
strong
proof
of
his
*NL*
opinions
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
circumstances
of
his
marriage
,
too
,
were
found
to
admit
of
much
*NL*
extenuation
.
This
was
an
article
not
to
be
entered
on
by
himself
;
but
*NL*
a
very
intimate
friend
of
his
,
a
Colonel
Wallis
,
a
highly
respectable
*NL*
man
,
perfectly
the
gentleman
,
-LRB-
and
not
an
ill-looking
man
,
Sir
Walter
*NL*
added
-RRB-
,
who
was
living
in
very
good
style
in
Marlborough
Buildings
,
and
*NL*
had
,
at
his
own
particular
request
,
been
admitted
to
their
acquaintance
*NL*
through
Mr
Elliot
,
had
mentioned
one
or
two
things
relative
to
the
*NL*
marriage
,
which
made
a
material
difference
in
the
discredit
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Wallis
had
known
Mr
Elliot
long
,
had
been
well
acquainted
also
*NL*
with
his
wife
,
had
perfectly
understood
the
whole
story
.
She
was
*NL*
certainly
not
a
woman
of
family
,
but
well
educated
,
accomplished
,
rich
,
*NL*
and
excessively
in
love
with
his
friend
.
There
had
been
the
charm
.
*NL*
She
had
sought
him
.
Without
that
attraction
,
not
all
her
money
would
*NL*
have
tempted
Elliot
,
and
Sir
Walter
was
,
moreover
,
assured
of
her
*NL*
having
been
a
very
fine
woman
.
Here
was
a
great
deal
to
soften
the
*NL*
business
.
A
very
fine
woman
with
a
large
fortune
,
in
love
with
him
!
*NL*
Sir
Walter
seemed
to
admit
it
as
complete
apology
;
and
though
Elizabeth
*NL*
could
not
see
the
circumstance
in
quite
so
favourable
a
light
,
she
*NL*
allowed
it
be
a
great
extenuation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
had
called
repeatedly
,
had
dined
with
them
once
,
evidently
*NL*
delighted
by
the
distinction
of
being
asked
,
for
they
gave
no
dinners
*NL*
in
general
;
delighted
,
in
short
,
by
every
proof
of
cousinly
notice
,
and
*NL*
placing
his
whole
happiness
in
being
on
intimate
terms
in
Camden
Place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
listened
,
but
without
quite
understanding
it
.
Allowances
,
large
*NL*
allowances
,
she
knew
,
must
be
made
for
the
ideas
of
those
who
spoke
.
*NL*
She
heard
it
all
under
embellishment
.
All
that
sounded
extravagant
or
*NL*
irrational
in
the
progress
of
the
reconciliation
might
have
no
origin
*NL*
but
in
the
language
of
the
relators
.
Still
,
however
,
she
had
the
*NL*
sensation
of
there
being
something
more
than
immediately
appeared
,
in
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
's
wishing
,
after
an
interval
of
so
many
years
,
to
be
well
*NL*
received
by
them
.
In
a
worldly
view
,
he
had
nothing
to
gain
by
being
*NL*
on
terms
with
Sir
Walter
;
nothing
to
risk
by
a
state
of
variance
.
In
*NL*
all
probability
he
was
already
the
richer
of
the
two
,
and
the
Kellynch
*NL*
estate
would
as
surely
be
his
hereafter
as
the
title
.
A
sensible
man
,
*NL*
and
he
had
looked
like
a
very
sensible
man
,
why
should
it
be
an
object
*NL*
to
him
?
She
could
only
offer
one
solution
;
it
was
,
perhaps
,
for
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
sake
.
There
might
really
have
been
a
liking
formerly
,
*NL*
though
convenience
and
accident
had
drawn
him
a
different
way
;
and
now
*NL*
that
he
could
afford
to
please
himself
,
he
might
mean
to
pay
his
*NL*
addresses
to
her
.
Elizabeth
was
certainly
very
handsome
,
with
*NL*
well-bred
,
elegant
manners
,
and
her
character
might
never
have
been
*NL*
penetrated
by
Mr
Elliot
,
knowing
her
but
in
public
,
and
when
very
young
*NL*
himself
.
How
her
temper
and
understanding
might
bear
the
investigation
*NL*
of
his
present
keener
time
of
life
was
another
concern
and
rather
a
*NL*
fearful
one
.
Most
earnestly
did
she
wish
that
he
might
not
be
too
*NL*
nice
,
or
too
observant
if
Elizabeth
were
his
object
;
and
that
Elizabeth
*NL*
was
disposed
to
believe
herself
so
,
and
that
her
friend
Mrs
Clay
was
*NL*
encouraging
the
idea
,
seemed
apparent
by
a
glance
or
two
between
them
,
*NL*
while
Mr
Elliot
's
frequent
visits
were
talked
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
mentioned
the
glimpses
she
had
had
of
him
at
Lyme
,
but
without
*NL*
being
much
attended
to
.
``
Oh
!
yes
,
perhaps
,
it
had
been
Mr
Elliot
.
*NL*
They
did
not
know
.
It
might
be
him
,
perhaps
.
''
They
could
not
listen
*NL*
to
her
description
of
him
.
They
were
describing
him
themselves
;
Sir
*NL*
Walter
especially
.
He
did
justice
to
his
very
gentlemanlike
*NL*
appearance
,
his
air
of
elegance
and
fashion
,
his
good
shaped
face
,
his
*NL*
sensible
eye
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
``
must
lament
his
being
very
much
*NL*
under-hung
,
a
defect
which
time
seemed
to
have
increased
;
nor
could
he
*NL*
pretend
to
say
that
ten
years
had
not
altered
almost
every
feature
for
*NL*
the
worse
.
Mr
Elliot
appeared
to
think
that
he
-LRB-
Sir
Walter
-RRB-
was
*NL*
looking
exactly
as
he
had
done
when
they
last
parted
;
''
but
Sir
Walter
*NL*
had
``
not
been
able
to
return
the
compliment
entirely
,
which
had
*NL*
embarrassed
him
.
He
did
not
mean
to
complain
,
however
.
Mr
Elliot
was
*NL*
better
to
look
at
than
most
men
,
and
he
had
no
objection
to
being
seen
*NL*
with
him
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
,
and
his
friends
in
Marlborough
Buildings
,
were
talked
of
the
*NL*
whole
evening
.
``
Colonel
Wallis
had
been
so
impatient
to
be
introduced
*NL*
to
them
!
and
Mr
Elliot
so
anxious
that
he
should
!
''
and
there
was
a
Mrs
*NL*
Wallis
,
at
present
known
only
to
them
by
description
,
as
she
was
in
*NL*
daily
expectation
of
her
confinement
;
but
Mr
Elliot
spoke
of
her
as
``
a
*NL*
most
charming
woman
,
quite
worthy
of
being
known
in
Camden
Place
,
''
and
*NL*
as
soon
as
she
recovered
they
were
to
be
acquainted
.
Sir
Walter
*NL*
thought
much
of
Mrs
Wallis
;
she
was
said
to
be
an
excessively
pretty
*NL*
woman
,
beautiful
.
``
He
longed
to
see
her
.
He
hoped
she
might
make
some
*NL*
amends
for
the
many
very
plain
faces
he
was
continually
passing
in
the
*NL*
streets
.
The
worst
of
Bath
was
the
number
of
its
plain
women
.
He
did
*NL*
not
mean
to
say
that
there
were
no
pretty
women
,
but
the
number
of
the
*NL*
plain
was
out
of
all
proportion
.
He
had
frequently
observed
,
as
he
*NL*
walked
,
that
one
handsome
face
would
be
followed
by
thirty
,
or
*NL*
five-and-thirty
frights
;
and
once
,
as
he
had
stood
in
a
shop
on
Bond
*NL*
Street
,
he
had
counted
eighty-seven
women
go
by
,
one
after
another
,
*NL*
without
there
being
a
tolerable
face
among
them
.
It
had
been
a
frosty
*NL*
morning
,
to
be
sure
,
a
sharp
frost
,
which
hardly
one
woman
in
a
*NL*
thousand
could
stand
the
test
of
.
But
still
,
there
certainly
were
a
*NL*
dreadful
multitude
of
ugly
women
in
Bath
;
and
as
for
the
men
!
they
*NL*
were
infinitely
worse
.
Such
scarecrows
as
the
streets
were
full
of
!
*NL*
It
was
evident
how
little
the
women
were
used
to
the
sight
of
anything
*NL*
tolerable
,
by
the
effect
which
a
man
of
decent
appearance
produced
.
He
*NL*
had
never
walked
anywhere
arm-in-arm
with
Colonel
Wallis
-LRB-
who
was
a
*NL*
fine
military
figure
,
though
sandy-haired
-RRB-
without
observing
that
every
*NL*
woman
's
eye
was
upon
him
;
every
woman
's
eye
was
sure
to
be
upon
Colonel
*NL*
Wallis
.
''
Modest
Sir
Walter
!
He
was
not
allowed
to
escape
,
however
.
*NL*
His
daughter
and
Mrs
Clay
united
in
hinting
that
Colonel
Wallis
's
*NL*
companion
might
have
as
good
a
figure
as
Colonel
Wallis
,
and
certainly
*NL*
was
not
sandy-haired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
Mary
looking
?
''
said
Sir
Walter
,
in
the
height
of
his
good
*NL*
humour
.
``
The
last
time
I
saw
her
she
had
a
red
nose
,
but
I
hope
that
*NL*
may
not
happen
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
no
,
that
must
have
been
quite
accidental
.
In
general
she
has
been
*NL*
in
very
good
health
and
very
good
looks
since
Michaelmas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
thought
it
would
not
tempt
her
to
go
out
in
sharp
winds
,
and
grow
*NL*
coarse
,
I
would
send
her
a
new
hat
and
pelisse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
considering
whether
she
should
venture
to
suggest
that
a
gown
,
*NL*
or
a
cap
,
would
not
be
liable
to
any
such
misuse
,
when
a
knock
at
the
*NL*
door
suspended
everything
.
``
A
knock
at
the
door
!
and
so
late
!
It
was
*NL*
ten
o'clock
.
Could
it
be
Mr
Elliot
?
They
knew
he
was
to
dine
in
*NL*
Lansdown
Crescent
.
It
was
possible
that
he
might
stop
in
his
way
home
*NL*
to
ask
them
how
they
did
.
They
could
think
of
no
one
else
.
Mrs
Clay
*NL*
decidedly
thought
it
Mr
Elliot
's
knock
.
''
Mrs
Clay
was
right
.
With
all
*NL*
the
state
which
a
butler
and
foot-boy
could
give
,
Mr
Elliot
was
ushered
*NL*
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
same
,
the
very
same
man
,
with
no
difference
but
of
dress
.
*NL*
Anne
drew
a
little
back
,
while
the
others
received
his
compliments
,
and
*NL*
her
sister
his
apologies
for
calling
at
so
unusual
an
hour
,
but
``
he
*NL*
could
not
be
so
near
without
wishing
to
know
that
neither
she
nor
her
*NL*
friend
had
taken
cold
the
day
before
,
''
&
c.
&
c
;
which
was
all
as
*NL*
politely
done
,
and
as
politely
taken
,
as
possible
,
but
her
part
must
*NL*
follow
then
.
Sir
Walter
talked
of
his
youngest
daughter
;
``
Mr
Elliot
*NL*
must
give
him
leave
to
present
him
to
his
youngest
daughter
''
-LRB-
there
was
*NL*
no
occasion
for
remembering
Mary
-RRB-
;
and
Anne
,
smiling
and
blushing
,
very
*NL*
becomingly
shewed
to
Mr
Elliot
the
pretty
features
which
he
had
by
no
*NL*
means
forgotten
,
and
instantly
saw
,
with
amusement
at
his
little
start
*NL*
of
surprise
,
that
he
had
not
been
at
all
aware
of
who
she
was
.
He
*NL*
looked
completely
astonished
,
but
not
more
astonished
than
pleased
;
his
*NL*
eyes
brightened
!
and
with
the
most
perfect
alacrity
he
welcomed
the
*NL*
relationship
,
alluded
to
the
past
,
and
entreated
to
be
received
as
an
*NL*
acquaintance
already
.
He
was
quite
as
good-looking
as
he
had
appeared
*NL*
at
Lyme
,
his
countenance
improved
by
speaking
,
and
his
manners
were
so
*NL*
exactly
what
they
ought
to
be
,
so
polished
,
so
easy
,
so
particularly
*NL*
agreeable
,
that
she
could
compare
them
in
excellence
to
only
one
*NL*
person
's
manners
.
They
were
not
the
same
,
but
they
were
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
equally
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
with
them
,
and
improved
their
conversation
very
much
.
*NL*
There
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
being
a
sensible
man
.
Ten
minutes
were
*NL*
enough
to
certify
that
.
His
tone
,
his
expressions
,
his
choice
of
*NL*
subject
,
his
knowing
where
to
stop
;
it
was
all
the
operation
of
a
*NL*
sensible
,
discerning
mind
.
As
soon
as
he
could
,
he
began
to
talk
to
*NL*
her
of
Lyme
,
wanting
to
compare
opinions
respecting
the
place
,
but
*NL*
especially
wanting
to
speak
of
the
circumstance
of
their
happening
to
*NL*
be
guests
in
the
same
inn
at
the
same
time
;
to
give
his
own
route
,
*NL*
understand
something
of
hers
,
and
regret
that
he
should
have
lost
such
*NL*
an
opportunity
of
paying
his
respects
to
her
.
She
gave
him
a
short
*NL*
account
of
her
party
and
business
at
Lyme
.
His
regret
increased
as
he
*NL*
listened
.
He
had
spent
his
whole
solitary
evening
in
the
room
*NL*
adjoining
theirs
;
had
heard
voices
,
mirth
continually
;
thought
they
*NL*
must
be
a
most
delightful
set
of
people
,
longed
to
be
with
them
,
but
*NL*
certainly
without
the
smallest
suspicion
of
his
possessing
the
shadow
*NL*
of
a
right
to
introduce
himself
.
If
he
had
but
asked
who
the
party
*NL*
were
!
The
name
of
Musgrove
would
have
told
him
enough
.
``
Well
,
it
*NL*
would
serve
to
cure
him
of
an
absurd
practice
of
never
asking
a
*NL*
question
at
an
inn
,
which
he
had
adopted
,
when
quite
a
young
man
,
on
*NL*
the
principal
of
its
being
very
ungenteel
to
be
curious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
notions
of
a
young
man
of
one
or
two
and
twenty
,
''
said
he
,
``
as
to
*NL*
what
is
necessary
in
manners
to
make
him
quite
the
thing
,
are
more
*NL*
absurd
,
I
believe
,
than
those
of
any
other
set
of
beings
in
the
world
.
*NL*
The
folly
of
the
means
they
often
employ
is
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
*NL*
folly
of
what
they
have
in
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
must
not
be
addressing
his
reflections
to
Anne
alone
:
he
knew
*NL*
it
;
he
was
soon
diffused
again
among
the
others
,
and
it
was
only
at
*NL*
intervals
that
he
could
return
to
Lyme
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
enquiries
,
however
,
produced
at
length
an
account
of
the
scene
she
*NL*
had
been
engaged
in
there
,
soon
after
his
leaving
the
place
.
Having
*NL*
alluded
to
``
an
accident
,
''
he
must
hear
the
whole
.
When
he
questioned
,
*NL*
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
began
to
question
also
,
but
the
difference
in
*NL*
their
manner
of
doing
it
could
not
be
unfelt
.
She
could
only
compare
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
to
Lady
Russell
,
in
the
wish
of
really
comprehending
what
had
*NL*
passed
,
and
in
the
degree
of
concern
for
what
she
must
have
suffered
in
*NL*
witnessing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
staid
an
hour
with
them
.
The
elegant
little
clock
on
the
mantel-piece
*NL*
had
struck
``
eleven
with
its
silver
sounds
,
''
and
the
watchman
was
*NL*
beginning
to
be
heard
at
a
distance
telling
the
same
tale
,
before
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
or
any
of
them
seemed
to
feel
that
he
had
been
there
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
could
not
have
supposed
it
possible
that
her
first
evening
in
*NL*
Camden
Place
could
have
passed
so
well
!
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
16
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
point
which
Anne
,
on
returning
to
her
family
,
would
have
*NL*
been
more
thankful
to
ascertain
even
than
Mr
Elliot
's
being
in
love
*NL*
with
Elizabeth
,
which
was
,
her
father
's
not
being
in
love
with
Mrs
*NL*
Clay
;
and
she
was
very
far
from
easy
about
it
,
when
she
had
been
at
*NL*
home
a
few
hours
.
On
going
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
,
she
*NL*
found
there
had
just
been
a
decent
pretence
on
the
lady
's
side
of
*NL*
meaning
to
leave
them
.
She
could
imagine
Mrs
Clay
to
have
said
,
that
*NL*
``
now
Miss
Anne
was
come
,
she
could
not
suppose
herself
at
all
wanted
;
''
*NL*
for
Elizabeth
was
replying
in
a
sort
of
whisper
,
``
That
must
not
be
any
*NL*
reason
,
indeed
.
I
assure
you
I
feel
it
none
.
She
is
nothing
to
me
,
*NL*
compared
with
you
;
''
and
she
was
in
full
time
to
hear
her
father
say
,
*NL*
``
My
dear
madam
,
this
must
not
be
.
As
yet
,
you
have
seen
nothing
of
*NL*
Bath
.
You
have
been
here
only
to
be
useful
.
You
must
not
run
away
*NL*
from
us
now
.
You
must
stay
to
be
acquainted
with
Mrs
Wallis
,
the
*NL*
beautiful
Mrs
Wallis
.
To
your
fine
mind
,
I
well
know
the
sight
of
*NL*
beauty
is
a
real
gratification
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
and
looked
so
much
in
earnest
,
that
Anne
was
not
surprised
to
*NL*
see
Mrs
Clay
stealing
a
glance
at
Elizabeth
and
herself
.
Her
*NL*
countenance
,
perhaps
,
might
express
some
watchfulness
;
but
the
praise
*NL*
of
the
fine
mind
did
not
appear
to
excite
a
thought
in
her
sister
.
The
*NL*
lady
could
not
but
yield
to
such
joint
entreaties
,
and
promise
to
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
the
same
morning
,
Anne
and
her
father
chancing
to
be
*NL*
alone
together
,
he
began
to
compliment
her
on
her
improved
looks
;
he
*NL*
thought
her
``
less
thin
in
her
person
,
in
her
cheeks
;
her
skin
,
her
*NL*
complexion
,
greatly
improved
;
clearer
,
fresher
.
Had
she
been
using
any
*NL*
thing
in
particular
?
''
``
No
,
nothing
.
''
``
Merely
Gowland
,
''
he
supposed
.
*NL*
``
No
,
nothing
at
all
.
''
``
Ha
!
he
was
surprised
at
that
;
''
and
added
,
*NL*
``
certainly
you
can
not
do
better
than
to
continue
as
you
are
;
you
can
not
*NL*
be
better
than
well
;
or
I
should
recommend
Gowland
,
the
constant
use
of
*NL*
Gowland
,
during
the
spring
months
.
Mrs
Clay
has
been
using
it
at
my
*NL*
recommendation
,
and
you
see
what
it
has
done
for
her
.
You
see
how
it
*NL*
has
carried
away
her
freckles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Elizabeth
could
but
have
heard
this
!
Such
personal
praise
might
*NL*
have
struck
her
,
especially
as
it
did
not
appear
to
Anne
that
the
*NL*
freckles
were
at
all
lessened
.
But
everything
must
take
its
chance
.
*NL*
The
evil
of
a
marriage
would
be
much
diminished
,
if
Elizabeth
were
also
*NL*
to
marry
.
As
for
herself
,
she
might
always
command
a
home
with
Lady
*NL*
Russell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
's
composed
mind
and
polite
manners
were
put
to
some
trial
*NL*
on
this
point
,
in
her
intercourse
in
Camden
Place
.
The
sight
of
Mrs
*NL*
Clay
in
such
favour
,
and
of
Anne
so
overlooked
,
was
a
perpetual
*NL*
provocation
to
her
there
;
and
vexed
her
as
much
when
she
was
away
,
as
a
*NL*
person
in
Bath
who
drinks
the
water
,
gets
all
the
new
publications
,
and
*NL*
has
a
very
large
acquaintance
,
has
time
to
be
vexed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr
Elliot
became
known
to
her
,
she
grew
more
charitable
,
or
more
*NL*
indifferent
,
towards
the
others
.
His
manners
were
an
immediate
*NL*
recommendation
;
and
on
conversing
with
him
she
found
the
solid
so
fully
*NL*
supporting
the
superficial
,
that
she
was
at
first
,
as
she
told
Anne
,
*NL*
almost
ready
to
exclaim
,
``
Can
this
be
Mr
Elliot
?
''
and
could
not
*NL*
seriously
picture
to
herself
a
more
agreeable
or
estimable
man
.
*NL*
Everything
united
in
him
;
good
understanding
,
correct
opinions
,
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
world
,
and
a
warm
heart
.
He
had
strong
feelings
of
*NL*
family
attachment
and
family
honour
,
without
pride
or
weakness
;
he
*NL*
lived
with
the
liberality
of
a
man
of
fortune
,
without
display
;
he
*NL*
judged
for
himself
in
everything
essential
,
without
defying
public
*NL*
opinion
in
any
point
of
worldly
decorum
.
He
was
steady
,
observant
,
*NL*
moderate
,
candid
;
never
run
away
with
by
spirits
or
by
selfishness
,
*NL*
which
fancied
itself
strong
feeling
;
and
yet
,
with
a
sensibility
to
*NL*
what
was
amiable
and
lovely
,
and
a
value
for
all
the
felicities
of
*NL*
domestic
life
,
which
characters
of
fancied
enthusiasm
and
violent
*NL*
agitation
seldom
really
possess
.
She
was
sure
that
he
had
not
been
*NL*
happy
in
marriage
.
Colonel
Wallis
said
it
,
and
Lady
Russell
saw
it
;
*NL*
but
it
had
been
no
unhappiness
to
sour
his
mind
,
nor
-LRB-
she
began
pretty
*NL*
soon
to
suspect
-RRB-
to
prevent
his
thinking
of
a
second
choice
.
Her
*NL*
satisfaction
in
Mr
Elliot
outweighed
all
the
plague
of
Mrs
Clay
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
some
years
since
Anne
had
begun
to
learn
that
she
and
her
*NL*
excellent
friend
could
sometimes
think
differently
;
and
it
did
not
*NL*
surprise
her
,
therefore
,
that
Lady
Russell
should
see
nothing
*NL*
suspicious
or
inconsistent
,
nothing
to
require
more
motives
than
*NL*
appeared
,
in
Mr
Elliot
's
great
desire
of
a
reconciliation
.
In
Lady
*NL*
Russell
's
view
,
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
Mr
Elliot
,
at
a
mature
*NL*
time
of
life
,
should
feel
it
a
most
desirable
object
,
and
what
would
*NL*
very
generally
recommend
him
among
all
sensible
people
,
to
be
on
good
*NL*
terms
with
the
head
of
his
family
;
the
simplest
process
in
the
world
of
*NL*
time
upon
a
head
naturally
clear
,
and
only
erring
in
the
heyday
of
*NL*
youth
.
Anne
presumed
,
however
,
still
to
smile
about
it
,
and
at
last
to
*NL*
mention
``
Elizabeth
.
''
Lady
Russell
listened
,
and
looked
,
and
made
only
*NL*
this
cautious
reply
:
--
``
Elizabeth
!
very
well
;
time
will
explain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
reference
to
the
future
,
which
Anne
,
after
a
little
*NL*
observation
,
felt
she
must
submit
to
.
She
could
determine
nothing
at
*NL*
present
.
In
that
house
Elizabeth
must
be
first
;
and
she
was
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
such
general
observance
as
``
Miss
Elliot
,
''
that
any
*NL*
particularity
of
attention
seemed
almost
impossible
.
Mr
Elliot
,
too
,
*NL*
it
must
be
remembered
,
had
not
been
a
widower
seven
months
.
A
little
*NL*
delay
on
his
side
might
be
very
excusable
.
In
fact
,
Anne
could
never
*NL*
see
the
crape
round
his
hat
,
without
fearing
that
she
was
the
*NL*
inexcusable
one
,
in
attributing
to
him
such
imaginations
;
for
though
*NL*
his
marriage
had
not
been
very
happy
,
still
it
had
existed
so
many
*NL*
years
that
she
could
not
comprehend
a
very
rapid
recovery
from
the
*NL*
awful
impression
of
its
being
dissolved
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
it
might
end
,
he
was
without
any
question
their
pleasantest
*NL*
acquaintance
in
Bath
:
she
saw
nobody
equal
to
him
;
and
it
was
a
great
*NL*
indulgence
now
and
then
to
talk
to
him
about
Lyme
,
which
he
seemed
to
*NL*
have
as
lively
a
wish
to
see
again
,
and
to
see
more
of
,
as
herself
.
*NL*
They
went
through
the
particulars
of
their
first
meeting
a
great
many
*NL*
times
.
He
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
had
looked
at
her
with
some
*NL*
earnestness
.
She
knew
it
well
;
and
she
remembered
another
person
's
*NL*
look
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
always
think
alike
.
His
value
for
rank
and
connexion
she
*NL*
perceived
was
greater
than
hers
.
It
was
not
merely
complaisance
,
it
*NL*
must
be
a
liking
to
the
cause
,
which
made
him
enter
warmly
into
her
*NL*
father
and
sister
's
solicitudes
on
a
subject
which
she
thought
unworthy
*NL*
to
excite
them
.
The
Bath
paper
one
morning
announced
the
arrival
of
*NL*
the
Dowager
Viscountess
Dalrymple
,
and
her
daughter
,
the
Honourable
*NL*
Miss
Carteret
;
and
all
the
comfort
of
No
.
--
,
Camden
Place
,
was
swept
*NL*
away
for
many
days
;
for
the
Dalrymples
-LRB-
in
Anne
's
opinion
,
most
*NL*
unfortunately
-RRB-
were
cousins
of
the
Elliots
;
and
the
agony
was
how
to
*NL*
introduce
themselves
properly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
never
seen
her
father
and
sister
before
in
contact
with
*NL*
nobility
,
and
she
must
acknowledge
herself
disappointed
.
She
had
hoped
*NL*
better
things
from
their
high
ideas
of
their
own
situation
in
life
,
and
*NL*
was
reduced
to
form
a
wish
which
she
had
never
foreseen
;
a
wish
that
*NL*
they
had
more
pride
;
for
``
our
cousins
Lady
Dalrymple
and
Miss
*NL*
Carteret
;
''
``
our
cousins
,
the
Dalrymples
,
''
sounded
in
her
ears
all
day
*NL*
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
had
once
been
in
company
with
the
late
viscount
,
but
had
*NL*
never
seen
any
of
the
rest
of
the
family
;
and
the
difficulties
of
the
*NL*
case
arose
from
there
having
been
a
suspension
of
all
intercourse
by
*NL*
letters
of
ceremony
,
ever
since
the
death
of
that
said
late
viscount
,
*NL*
when
,
in
consequence
of
a
dangerous
illness
of
Sir
Walter
's
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
there
had
been
an
unlucky
omission
at
Kellynch
.
No
letter
of
*NL*
condolence
had
been
sent
to
Ireland
.
The
neglect
had
been
visited
on
*NL*
the
head
of
the
sinner
;
for
when
poor
Lady
Elliot
died
herself
,
no
*NL*
letter
of
condolence
was
received
at
Kellynch
,
and
,
consequently
,
there
*NL*
was
but
too
much
reason
to
apprehend
that
the
Dalrymples
considered
the
*NL*
relationship
as
closed
.
How
to
have
this
anxious
business
set
to
*NL*
rights
,
and
be
admitted
as
cousins
again
,
was
the
question
:
and
it
was
*NL*
a
question
which
,
in
a
more
rational
manner
,
neither
Lady
Russell
nor
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
thought
unimportant
.
``
Family
connexions
were
always
worth
*NL*
preserving
,
good
company
always
worth
seeking
;
Lady
Dalrymple
had
taken
*NL*
a
house
,
for
three
months
,
in
Laura
Place
,
and
would
be
living
in
*NL*
style
.
She
had
been
at
Bath
the
year
before
,
and
Lady
Russell
had
*NL*
heard
her
spoken
of
as
a
charming
woman
.
It
was
very
desirable
that
*NL*
the
connexion
should
be
renewed
,
if
it
could
be
done
,
without
any
*NL*
compromise
of
propriety
on
the
side
of
the
Elliots
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
,
however
,
would
choose
his
own
means
,
and
at
last
wrote
a
*NL*
very
fine
letter
of
ample
explanation
,
regret
,
and
entreaty
,
to
his
*NL*
right
honourable
cousin
.
Neither
Lady
Russell
nor
Mr
Elliot
could
*NL*
admire
the
letter
;
but
it
did
all
that
was
wanted
,
in
bringing
three
*NL*
lines
of
scrawl
from
the
Dowager
Viscountess
.
``
She
was
very
much
*NL*
honoured
,
and
should
be
happy
in
their
acquaintance
.
''
The
toils
of
the
*NL*
business
were
over
,
the
sweets
began
.
They
visited
in
Laura
Place
,
*NL*
they
had
the
cards
of
Dowager
Viscountess
Dalrymple
,
and
the
Honourable
*NL*
Miss
Carteret
,
to
be
arranged
wherever
they
might
be
most
visible
:
and
*NL*
``
Our
cousins
in
Laura
Place
,
''
--
``
Our
cousin
,
Lady
Dalrymple
and
Miss
*NL*
Carteret
,
''
were
talked
of
to
everybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
ashamed
.
Had
Lady
Dalrymple
and
her
daughter
even
been
very
*NL*
agreeable
,
she
would
still
have
been
ashamed
of
the
agitation
they
*NL*
created
,
but
they
were
nothing
.
There
was
no
superiority
of
manner
,
*NL*
accomplishment
,
or
understanding
.
Lady
Dalrymple
had
acquired
the
name
*NL*
of
``
a
charming
woman
,
''
because
she
had
a
smile
and
a
civil
answer
for
*NL*
everybody
.
Miss
Carteret
,
with
still
less
to
say
,
was
so
plain
and
so
*NL*
awkward
,
that
she
would
never
have
been
tolerated
in
Camden
Place
but
*NL*
for
her
birth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
confessed
she
had
expected
something
better
;
but
yet
``
it
*NL*
was
an
acquaintance
worth
having
;
''
and
when
Anne
ventured
to
speak
her
*NL*
opinion
of
them
to
Mr
Elliot
,
he
agreed
to
their
being
nothing
in
*NL*
themselves
,
but
still
maintained
that
,
as
a
family
connexion
,
as
good
*NL*
company
,
as
those
who
would
collect
good
company
around
them
,
they
had
*NL*
their
value
.
Anne
smiled
and
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
idea
of
good
company
,
Mr
Elliot
,
is
the
company
of
clever
,
*NL*
well-informed
people
,
who
have
a
great
deal
of
conversation
;
that
is
*NL*
what
I
call
good
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,

said
he
gently
,
``
that

requires
only
birth

*NL*
and
with
regard
to
education
is
not
very
nice

Birth

good

are
essential

by
no

a
dangerous
thing

on
the
contrary

it
will
do
very
well

My

shakes
her

She

not

She
is
fastidious

-LRB-
sitting
down
by
her

,
``
you
have
a
better
right

almost
any

know

will
it

*NL*
Will
it

Will
it
not

those
good

enjoy
all

You

she
added

I
have
more

be
so
*NL*
solicitous

have
the
relationship
acknowledged

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon

In

it
might
be
as
you
say

in

Sir

*NL*

Well

*NL*

would
have
*NL*
the

I
have
no

the

different

I
am

no

else
in

-RRB-

in
one
*NL*
point

*NL*
He
looked
,
as
he
spoke

to
the
seat
which
Mrs
Clay
had
been
lately
*NL*
occupying
:
a
sufficient
explanation
of
what
he
particularly
meant
;
and
*NL*
though
Anne
could
not
believe
in
their
having
the
same
sort
of
pride
,
*NL*
she
was
pleased
with
him
for
not
liking
Mrs
Clay
;
and
her
conscience
*NL*
admitted
that
his
wishing
to
promote
her
father
's
getting
great
*NL*
acquaintance
was
more
than
excusable
in
the
view
of
defeating
her

Chapter
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
were
assiduously
pushing
their
good
*NL*
fortune
in
Laura
Place
,
Anne
was
renewing
an
acquaintance
of
a
very
*NL*
different
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
called
on
her
former
governess
,
and
had
heard
from
her
of
there
*NL*
being
an
old
school-fellow
in
Bath
,
who
had
the
two
strong
claims
on
*NL*
her
attention
of
past
kindness
and
present
suffering
.
Miss
Hamilton
,
*NL*
now
Mrs
Smith
,
had
shewn
her
kindness
in
one
of
those
periods
of
her
*NL*
life
when
it
had
been
most
valuable
.
Anne
had
gone
unhappy
to
school
,
*NL*
grieving
for
the
loss
of
a
mother
whom
she
had
dearly
loved
,
feeling
*NL*
her
separation
from
home
,
and
suffering
as
a
girl
of
fourteen
,
of
*NL*
strong
sensibility
and
not
high
spirits
,
must
suffer
at
such
a
time
;
*NL*
and
Miss
Hamilton
,
three
years
older
than
herself
,
but
still
from
the
*NL*
want
of
near
relations
and
a
settled
home
,
remaining
another
year
at
*NL*
school
,
had
been
useful
and
good
to
her
in
a
way
which
had
considerably
*NL*
lessened
her
misery
,
and
could
never
be
remembered
with
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Hamilton
had
left
school
,
had
married
not
long
afterwards
,
was
*NL*
said
to
have
married
a
man
of
fortune
,
and
this
was
all
that
Anne
had
*NL*
known
of
her
,
till
now
that
their
governess
's
account
brought
her
*NL*
situation
forward
in
a
more
decided
but
very
different
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
widow
and
poor
.
Her
husband
had
been
extravagant
;
and
at
his
*NL*
death
,
about
two
years
before
,
had
left
his
affairs
dreadfully
*NL*
involved
.
She
had
had
difficulties
of
every
sort
to
contend
with
,
and
*NL*
in
addition
to
these
distresses
had
been
afflicted
with
a
severe
*NL*
rheumatic
fever
,
which
,
finally
settling
in
her
legs
,
had
made
her
for
*NL*
the
present
a
cripple
.
She
had
come
to
Bath
on
that
account
,
and
was
*NL*
now
in
lodgings
near
the
hot
baths
,
living
in
a
very
humble
way
,
unable
*NL*
even
to
afford
herself
the
comfort
of
a
servant
,
and
of
course
almost
*NL*
excluded
from
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
mutual
friend
answered
for
the
satisfaction
which
a
visit
from
*NL*
Miss
Elliot
would
give
Mrs
Smith
,
and
Anne
therefore
lost
no
time
in
*NL*
going
.
She
mentioned
nothing
of
what
she
had
heard
,
or
what
she
*NL*
intended
,
at
home
.
It
would
excite
no
proper
interest
there
.
She
only
*NL*
consulted
Lady
Russell
,
who
entered
thoroughly
into
her
sentiments
,
and
*NL*
was
most
happy
to
convey
her
as
near
to
Mrs
Smith
's
lodgings
in
*NL*
Westgate
Buildings
,
as
Anne
chose
to
be
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visit
was
paid
,
their
acquaintance
re-established
,
their
interest
*NL*
in
each
other
more
than
re-kindled
.
The
first
ten
minutes
had
its
*NL*
awkwardness
and
its
emotion
.
Twelve
years
were
gone
since
they
had
*NL*
parted
,
and
each
presented
a
somewhat
different
person
from
what
the
*NL*
other
had
imagined
.
Twelve
years
had
changed
Anne
from
the
blooming
,
*NL*
silent
,
unformed
girl
of
fifteen
,
to
the
elegant
little
woman
of
*NL*
seven-and-twenty
,
with
every
beauty
except
bloom
,
and
with
manners
as
*NL*
consciously
right
as
they
were
invariably
gentle
;
and
twelve
years
had
*NL*
transformed
the
fine-looking
,
well-grown
Miss
Hamilton
,
in
all
the
glow
*NL*
of
health
and
confidence
of
superiority
,
into
a
poor
,
infirm
,
helpless
*NL*
widow
,
receiving
the
visit
of
her
former
protegee
as
a
favour
;
but
all
*NL*
that
was
uncomfortable
in
the
meeting
had
soon
passed
away
,
and
left
*NL*
only
the
interesting
charm
of
remembering
former
partialities
and
*NL*
talking
over
old
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
found
in
Mrs
Smith
the
good
sense
and
agreeable
manners
which
she
*NL*
had
almost
ventured
to
depend
on
,
and
a
disposition
to
converse
and
be
*NL*
cheerful
beyond
her
expectation
.
Neither
the
dissipations
of
the
*NL*
past
--
and
she
had
lived
very
much
in
the
world
--
nor
the
restrictions
of
*NL*
the
present
,
neither
sickness
nor
sorrow
seemed
to
have
closed
her
*NL*
heart
or
ruined
her
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
a
second
visit
she
talked
with
great
openness
,
and
*NL*
Anne
's
astonishment
increased
.
She
could
scarcely
imagine
a
more
*NL*
cheerless
situation
in
itself
than
Mrs
Smith
's
.
She
had
been
very
fond
*NL*
of
her
husband
:
she
had
buried
him
.
She
had
been
used
to
affluence
:
*NL*
it
was
gone
.
She
had
no
child
to
connect
her
with
life
and
happiness
*NL*
again
,
no
relations
to
assist
in
the
arrangement
of
perplexed
affairs
,
*NL*
no
health
to
make
all
the
rest
supportable
.
Her
accommodations
were
*NL*
limited
to
a
noisy
parlour
,
and
a
dark
bedroom
behind
,
with
no
*NL*
possibility
of
moving
from
one
to
the
other
without
assistance
,
which
*NL*
there
was
only
one
servant
in
the
house
to
afford
,
and
she
never
*NL*
quitted
the
house
but
to
be
conveyed
into
the
warm
bath
.
Yet
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
all
this
,
Anne
had
reason
to
believe
that
she
had
moments
only
of
*NL*
languor
and
depression
,
to
hours
of
occupation
and
enjoyment
.
How
*NL*
could
it
be
?
She
watched
,
observed
,
reflected
,
and
finally
determined
*NL*
that
this
was
not
a
case
of
fortitude
or
of
resignation
only
.
A
*NL*
submissive
spirit
might
be
patient
,
a
strong
understanding
would
supply
*NL*
resolution
,
but
here
was
something
more
;
here
was
that
elasticity
of
*NL*
mind
,
that
disposition
to
be
comforted
,
that
power
of
turning
readily
*NL*
from
evil
to
good
,
and
of
finding
employment
which
carried
her
out
of
*NL*
herself
,
which
was
from
nature
alone
.
It
was
the
choicest
gift
of
*NL*
Heaven
;
and
Anne
viewed
her
friend
as
one
of
those
instances
in
which
,
*NL*
by
a
merciful
appointment
,
it
seems
designed
to
counterbalance
almost
*NL*
every
other
want
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
a
time
,
Mrs
Smith
told
her
,
when
her
spirits
had
nearly
*NL*
failed
.
She
could
not
call
herself
an
invalid
now
,
compared
with
her
*NL*
state
on
first
reaching
Bath
.
Then
she
had
,
indeed
,
been
a
pitiable
*NL*
object
;
for
she
had
caught
cold
on
the
journey
,
and
had
hardly
taken
*NL*
possession
of
her
lodgings
before
she
was
again
confined
to
her
bed
and
*NL*
suffering
under
severe
and
constant
pain
;
and
all
this
among
strangers
,
*NL*
with
the
absolute
necessity
of
having
a
regular
nurse
,
and
finances
at
*NL*
that
moment
particularly
unfit
to
meet
any
extraordinary
expense
.
She
*NL*
had
weathered
it
,
however
,
and
could
truly
say
that
it
had
done
her
*NL*
good
.
It
had
increased
her
comforts
by
making
her
feel
herself
to
be
*NL*
in
good
hands
.
She
had
seen
too
much
of
the
world
,
to
expect
sudden
or
*NL*
disinterested
attachment
anywhere
,
but
her
illness
had
proved
to
her
*NL*
that
her
landlady
had
a
character
to
preserve
,
and
would
not
use
her
*NL*
ill
;
and
she
had
been
particularly
fortunate
in
her
nurse
,
as
a
sister
*NL*
of
her
landlady
,
a
nurse
by
profession
,
and
who
had
always
a
home
in
*NL*
that
house
when
unemployed
,
chanced
to
be
at
liberty
just
in
time
to
*NL*
attend
her
.
``
And
she
,
''
said
Mrs
Smith
,
``
besides
nursing
me
most
*NL*
admirably
,
has
really
proved
an
invaluable
acquaintance
.
As
soon
as
I
*NL*
could
use
my
hands
she
taught
me
to
knit
,
which
has
been
a
great
*NL*
amusement
;
and
she
put
me
in
the
way
of
making
these
little
*NL*
thread-cases
,
pin-cushions
and
card-racks
,
which
you
always
find
me
so
*NL*
busy
about
,
and
which
supply
me
with
the
means
of
doing
a
little
good
*NL*
to
one
or
two
very
poor
families
in
this
neighbourhood
.
She
had
a
*NL*
large
acquaintance
,
of
course
professionally
,
among
those
who
can
*NL*
afford
to
buy
,
and
she
disposes
of
my
merchandise
.
She
always
takes
*NL*
the
right
time
for
applying
.
Everybody
's
heart
is
open
,
you
know
,
when
*NL*
they
have
recently
escaped
from
severe
pain
,
or
are
recovering
the
*NL*
blessing
of
health
,
and
Nurse
Rooke
thoroughly
understands
when
to
*NL*
speak
.
She
is
a
shrewd
,
intelligent
,
sensible
woman
.
Hers
is
a
line
*NL*
for
seeing
human
nature
;
and
she
has
a
fund
of
good
sense
and
*NL*
observation
,
which
,
as
a
companion
,
make
her
infinitely
superior
to
*NL*
thousands
of
those
who
having
only
received
`
the
best
education
in
the
*NL*
world
,
'
know
nothing
worth
attending
to
.
Call
it
gossip
,
if
you
will
,
*NL*
but
when
Nurse
Rooke
has
half
an
hour
's
leisure
to
bestow
on
me
,
she
is
*NL*
sure
to
have
something
to
relate
that
is
entertaining
and
profitable
:
*NL*
something
that
makes
one
know
one
's
species
better
.
One
likes
to
hear
*NL*
what
is
going
on
,
to
be
au
fait
as
to
the
newest
modes
of
being
*NL*
trifling
and
silly
.
To
me
,
who
live
so
much
alone
,
her
conversation
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
is
a
treat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
,
far
from
wishing
to
cavil
at
the
pleasure
,
replied
,
``
I
can
easily
*NL*
believe
it
.
Women
of
that
class
have
great
opportunities
,
and
if
they
*NL*
are
intelligent
may
be
well
worth
listening
to
.
Such
varieties
of
*NL*
human
nature
as
they
are
in
the
habit
of
witnessing
!
And
it
is
not
*NL*
merely
in
its
follies
,
that
they
are
well
read
;
for
they
see
it
*NL*
occasionally
under
every
circumstance
that
can
be
most
interesting
or
*NL*
affecting
.
What
instances
must
pass
before
them
of
ardent
,
*NL*
disinterested
,
self-denying
attachment
,
of
heroism
,
fortitude
,
*NL*
patience
,
resignation
:
of
all
the
conflicts
and
all
the
sacrifices
*NL*
that
ennoble
us
most
.
A
sick
chamber
may
often
furnish
the
worth
of

volumes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mrs
Smith
more
doubtingly
,
``
sometimes
it
may
,
though
I
fear
*NL*
its
lessons
are
not
often
in
the
elevated
style
you
describe

there

human
nature
may
be
great
in
times
of
trial
;
but
generally
*NL*
speaking
,
it
is
its
weakness
and
not
its
strength
that
appears
in
a
*NL*
sick
chamber
:
it
is
selfishness
and
impatience
rather
than
generosity
*NL*
and
fortitude
,
that
one
hears
of
.
There
is
so
little
real
friendship
*NL*
in
the
world
!
and
unfortunately
''
-LRB-
speaking
low
and
tremulously
-RRB-
``
there
*NL*
are
so
many
who
forget
to
think
seriously
till
it
is
almost
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
saw
the
misery
of
such
feelings
.
The
husband
had
not
been
what
he
*NL*
ought
,
and
the
wife
had
been
led
among
that
part
of
mankind
which
made
*NL*
her
think
worse
of
the
world
than
she
hoped
it
deserved
.
It
was
but
a
*NL*
passing
emotion
however
with
Mrs
Smith
;
she
shook
it
off
,
and
soon
*NL*
added
in
a
different
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
suppose
the
situation
my
friend
Mrs
Rooke
is
in
at
present
,
*NL*
will
furnish
much
either
to
interest
or
edify
me
.
She
is
only
nursing
*NL*
Mrs
Wallis
of
Marlborough
Buildings
;
a
mere
pretty
,
silly
,
expensive
,
*NL*
fashionable
woman
,
I
believe
;
and
of
course
will
have
nothing
to
report
*NL*
but
of
lace
and
finery
.
I
mean
to
make
my
profit
of
Mrs
Wallis
,
*NL*
however
.
She
has
plenty
of
money
,
and
I
intend
she
shall
buy
all
the
*NL*
high-priced
things
I
have
in
hand
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
called
several
times
on
her
friend
,
before
the
existence
of
*NL*
such
a
person
was
known
in
Camden
Place
.
At
last
,
it
became
necessary
*NL*
to
speak
of
her
.
Sir
Walter
,
Elizabeth
and
Mrs
Clay
,
returned
one
*NL*
morning
from
Laura
Place
,
with
a
sudden
invitation
from
Lady
Dalrymple
*NL*
for
the
same
evening
,
and
Anne
was
already
engaged
,
to
spend
that
*NL*
evening
in
Westgate
Buildings
.
She
was
not
sorry
for
the
excuse
.
They
*NL*
were
only
asked
,
she
was
sure
,
because
Lady
Dalrymple
being
kept
at
*NL*
home
by
a
bad
cold
,
was
glad
to
make
use
of
the
relationship
which
had
*NL*
been
so
pressed
on
her
;
and
she
declined
on
her
own
account
with
great
*NL*
alacrity
--
``
She
was
engaged
to
spend
the
evening
with
an
old
*NL*
schoolfellow
.
''
They
were
not
much
interested
in
anything
relative
to
*NL*
Anne
;
but
still
there
were
questions
enough
asked
,
to
make
it
*NL*
understood
what
this
old
schoolfellow
was
;
and
Elizabeth
was
*NL*
disdainful
,
and
Sir
Walter
severe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Westgate
Buildings
!
''
said
he
,
``
and
who
is
Miss
Anne
Elliot
to
be
*NL*
visiting
in
Westgate
Buildings
?
A
Mrs
Smith
.
A
widow
Mrs
Smith
;
and
*NL*
who
was
her
husband
?
One
of
five
thousand
Mr
Smiths
whose
names
are
to
*NL*
be
met
with
everywhere
.
And
what
is
her
attraction
?
That
she
is
old
*NL*
and
sickly
.
Upon
my
word
,
Miss
Anne
Elliot
,
you
have
the
most
*NL*
extraordinary
taste
!
Everything
that
revolts
other
people
,
low
*NL*
company
,
paltry
rooms
,
foul
air
,
disgusting
associations
are
inviting
*NL*
to
you
.
But
surely
you
may
put
off
this
old
lady
till
to-morrow
:
she
*NL*
is
not
so
near
her
end
,
I
presume
,
but
that
she
may
hope
to
see
another
*NL*
day
.
What
is
her
age
?
Forty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
she
is
not
one-and-thirty
;
but
I
do
not
think
I
can
put
off
*NL*
my
engagement
,
because
it
is
the
only
evening
for
some
time
which
will
*NL*
at
once
suit
her
and
myself
.
She
goes
into
the
warm
bath
to-morrow
,
*NL*
and
for
the
rest
of
the
week
,
you
know
,
we
are
engaged

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
does
Lady
Russell
think
of
this
acquaintance
?
''
asked
*NL*
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
sees
nothing
to
blame
in
it
,
''
replied
Anne
;
``
on
the
contrary
,
she
*NL*
approves
it
,
and
has
generally
taken
me
when
I
have
called
on
Mrs

Smith

*NL*
*NL*
``
Westgate
Buildings
must
have
been
rather
surprised

the
appearance

''
observed
Sir
Walter
.
``
Sir
*NL*
Henry
Russell
's
widow
,
indeed
,
has
no
honours
to
distinguish
her
arms

but
still
it
is
a
handsome
equipage
,
and
no
doubt
is
well
known
to
*NL*
convey
a
Miss
Elliot
.
A
widow
Mrs
Smith
lodging
in
Westgate
Buildings
!
*NL*
A
poor
widow
barely
able
to
live

between
thirty

forty
;
a
mere
Mrs

an
every-day
Mrs

,
of
all
people
and
all
names
in
the
*NL*
world
,
to
be
the
chosen
friend
of
Miss
Anne
Elliot

and
to
be
preferred

by
her
to
her
own
family
connections
among
the
nobility
of
England
and
*NL*
Ireland
!
Mrs
Smith
!
Such
a
name
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Clay
,
who
had
been
present
while
all
this
passed
,
now
thought
it
*NL*
advisable
to
leave
the
room
,
and
Anne
could
have
said
much
,
and
did
*NL*
long
to
say
a
little
in
defence
of
her
friend
's
not
very
dissimilar
*NL*
claims
to
theirs
,
but
her
sense
of
personal
respect
to
her
father
*NL*
prevented
her
.
She
made
no
reply
.
She
left
it
to
himself
to
*NL*
recollect
,
that
Mrs
Smith
was
not
the
only
widow
in
Bath
between
thirty
*NL*
and
forty
,
with
little
to
live
on
,
and
no
surname
of
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
kept
her
appointment
;
the
others
kept
theirs
,
and
of
course
she
*NL*
heard
the
next
morning
that
they
had
had
a
delightful
evening
.
She
had
*NL*
been
the
only
one
of
the
set
absent
,
for
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
had
*NL*
not
only
been
quite
at
her
ladyship
's
service
themselves
,
but
had
*NL*
actually
been
happy
to
be
employed
by
her
in
collecting
others
,
and
had
*NL*
been
at
the
trouble
of
inviting
both
Lady
Russell
and
Mr
Elliot
;
and
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
had
made
a
point
of
leaving
Colonel
Wallis
early
,
and
Lady
*NL*
Russell
had
fresh
arranged
all
her
evening
engagements
in
order
to
wait
*NL*
on
her
.
Anne
had
the
whole
history
of
all
that
such
an
evening
could
*NL*
supply
from
Lady
Russell
.
To
her
,
its
greatest
interest
must
be
,
in
*NL*
having
been
very
much
talked
of
between
her
friend
and
Mr
Elliot
;
in
*NL*
having
been
wished
for
,
regretted
,
and
at
the
same
time
honoured
for
*NL*
staying
away
in
such
a
cause
.
Her
kind
,
compassionate
visits
to
this
*NL*
old
schoolfellow
,
sick
and
reduced
,
seemed
to
have
quite
delighted
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
.
He
thought
her
a
most
extraordinary
young
woman
;
in
her
*NL*
temper
,
manners
,
mind
,
a
model
of
female
excellence
.
He
could
meet
*NL*
even
Lady
Russell
in
a
discussion
of
her
merits
;
and
Anne
could
not
be
*NL*
given
to
understand
so
much
by
her
friend
,
could
not
know
herself
to
be
*NL*
so
highly
rated
by
a
sensible
man
,
without
many
of
those
agreeable
*NL*
sensations
which
her
friend
meant
to
create
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
was
now
perfectly
decided
in
her
opinion
of
Mr
Elliot
.
*NL*
She
was
as
much
convinced
of
his
meaning
to
gain
Anne
in
time
as
of
his
*NL*
deserving
her
,
and
was
beginning
to
calculate
the
number
of
weeks
which
*NL*
would
free
him
from
all
the
remaining
restraints
of
widowhood
,
and
*NL*
leave
him
at
liberty
to
exert
his
most
open
powers
of
pleasing
.
She
*NL*
would
not
speak
to
Anne
with
half
the
certainty
she
felt
on
the
*NL*
subject
,
she
would
venture
on
little
more
than
hints
of
what
might
be
*NL*
hereafter
,
of
a
possible
attachment
on
his
side
,
of
the
desirableness
*NL*
of
the
alliance
,
supposing
such
attachment
to
be
real
and
returned
.
*NL*
Anne
heard
her
,
and
made
no
violent
exclamations
;
she
only
smiled
,
*NL*
blushed
,
and
gently
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
match-maker
,
as
you
well
know
,
''
said
Lady
Russell
,
``
being
much
*NL*
too
well
aware
of
the
uncertainty
of
all
human
events
and
calculations
.
*NL*
I
only
mean
that
if
Mr
Elliot
should
some
time
hence
pay
his
addresses
*NL*
to
you
,
and
if
you
should
be
disposed
to
accept
him
,
I
think
there
*NL*
would
be
every
possibility
of
your
being
happy
together
.
A
most
*NL*
suitable
connection
everybody
must
consider
it
,
but
I
think
it
might
be
*NL*
a
very
happy
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Elliot
is
an
exceedingly
agreeable
man
,
and
in
many
respects
I
*NL*
think
highly
of
him
,
''
said
Anne
;
``
but
we
should
not
suit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
let
this
pass
,
and
only
said
in
rejoinder
,
``
I
own
that
to
*NL*
be
able
to
regard
you
as
the
future
mistress
of
Kellynch
,
the
future
*NL*
Lady
Elliot
,
to
look
forward
and
see
you
occupying
your
dear
mother
's
*NL*
place
,
succeeding
to
all
her
rights
,
and
all
her
popularity
,
as
well
as
*NL*
to
all
her
virtues
,
would
be
the
highest
possible
gratification
to
me
.
*NL*
You
are
your
mother
's
self
in
countenance
and
disposition
;
and
if
I
*NL*
might
be
allowed
to
fancy
you
such
as
she
was
,
in
situation
and
name
,
*NL*
and
home
,
presiding
and
blessing
in
the
same
spot
,
and
only
superior
to
*NL*
her
in
being
more
highly
valued
!
My
dearest
Anne
,
it
would
give
me
*NL*
more
delight
than
is
often
felt
at
my
time
of
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
obliged
to
turn
away
,
to
rise
,
to
walk
to
a
distant
table
,
*NL*
and
,
leaning
there
in
pretended
employment
,
try
to
subdue
the
feelings
*NL*
this
picture
excited
.
For
a
few
moments
her
imagination
and
her
heart
*NL*
were
bewitched
.
The
idea
of
becoming
what
her
mother
had
been
;
of
*NL*
having
the
precious
name
of
``
Lady
Elliot
''
first
revived
in
herself
;
of
*NL*
being
restored
to
Kellynch
,
calling
it
her
home
again
,
her
home
for
*NL*
ever
,
was
a
charm
which
she
could
not
immediately
resist
.
Lady
Russell
*NL*
said
not
another
word
,
willing
to
leave
the
matter
to
its
own
*NL*
operation
;
and
believing
that
,
could
Mr
Elliot
at
that
moment
with
*NL*
propriety
have
spoken
for
himself
!
--
she
believed
,
in
short
,
what
Anne
*NL*
did
not
believe
.
The
same
image
of
Mr
Elliot
speaking
for
himself
*NL*
brought
Anne
to
composure
again
.
The
charm
of
Kellynch
and
of
``
Lady
*NL*
Elliot
''
all
faded
away
.
She
never
could
accept
him
.
And
it
was
not
*NL*
only
that
her
feelings
were
still
adverse
to
any
man
save
one
;
her
*NL*
judgement
,
on
a
serious
consideration
of
the
possibilities
of
such
a
*NL*
case
was
against
Mr
Elliot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
they
had
now
been
acquainted
a
month
,
she
could
not
be
satisfied
*NL*
that
she
really
knew
his
character
.
That
he
was
a
sensible
man
,
an
*NL*
agreeable
man
,
that
he
talked
well
,
professed
good
opinions
,
seemed
to
*NL*
judge
properly
and
as
a
man
of
principle
,
this
was
all
clear
enough
.
*NL*
He
certainly
knew
what
was
right
,
nor
could
she
fix
on
any
one
article
*NL*
of
moral
duty
evidently
transgressed
;
but
yet
she
would
have
been
*NL*
afraid
to
answer
for
his
conduct
.
She
distrusted
the
past
,
if
not
the
*NL*
present
.
The
names
which
occasionally
dropt
of
former
associates
,
the
*NL*
allusions
to
former
practices
and
pursuits
,
suggested
suspicions
not
*NL*
favourable
of
what
he
had
been
.
She
saw
that
there
had
been
bad
*NL*
habits
;
that
Sunday
travelling
had
been
a
common
thing
;
that
there
had
*NL*
been
a
period
of
his
life
-LRB-
and
probably
not
a
short
one
-RRB-
when
he
had
*NL*
been
,
at
least
,
careless
in
all
serious
matters
;
and
,
though
he
might
*NL*
now
think
very
differently
,
who
could
answer
for
the
true
sentiments
of
*NL*
a
clever
,
cautious
man
,
grown
old
enough
to
appreciate
a
fair
*NL*
character
?
How
could
it
ever
be
ascertained
that
his
mind
was
truly
*NL*
cleansed
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
was
rational
,
discreet
,
polished
,
but
he
was
not
open
.
There
*NL*
was
never
any
burst
of
feeling
,
any
warmth
of
indignation
or
delight
,
*NL*
at
the
evil
or
good
of
others
.
This
,
to
Anne
,
was
a
decided
*NL*
imperfection
.
Her
early
impressions
were
incurable
.
She
prized
the
*NL*
frank
,
the
open-hearted
,
the
eager
character
beyond
all
others
.
Warmth
*NL*
and
enthusiasm
did
captivate
her
still
.
She
felt
that
she
could
so
*NL*
much
more
depend
upon
the
sincerity
of
those
who
sometimes
looked
or
*NL*
said
a
careless
or
a
hasty
thing
,
than
of
those
whose
presence
of
mind
*NL*
never
varied
,
whose
tongue
never
slipped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
was
too
generally
agreeable
.
Various
as
were
the
tempers
in
*NL*
her
father
's
house
,
he
pleased
them
all
.
He
endured
too
well
,
stood
*NL*
too
well
with
every
body
.
He
had
spoken
to
her
with
some
degree
of
*NL*
openness
of
Mrs
Clay
;
had
appeared
completely
to
see
what
Mrs
Clay
was
*NL*
about
,
and
to
hold
her
in
contempt
;
and
yet
Mrs
Clay
found
him
as
*NL*
agreeable
as
any
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Russell
saw
either
less
or
more
than
her
young
friend
,
for
she
saw
*NL*
nothing
to
excite
distrust
.
She
could
not
imagine
a
man
more
exactly
*NL*
what
he
ought
to
be
than
Mr
Elliot
;
nor
did
she
ever
enjoy
a
sweeter
*NL*
feeling
than
the
hope
of
seeing
him
receive
the
hand
of
her
beloved
*NL*
Anne
in
Kellynch
church
,
in
the
course
of
the
following
autumn

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
beginning
of
February
;
and
Anne
,
having
been
a
month
in
*NL*
Bath
,
was
growing
very
eager
for
news
from
Uppercross
and
Lyme
.
She
*NL*
wanted
to
hear
much
more
than
Mary
had
communicated
.
It
was
three
*NL*
weeks
since
she
had
heard
at
all
.
She
only
knew
that
Henrietta
was
at
*NL*
home
again
;
and
that
Louisa
,
though
considered
to
be
recovering
fast
,
*NL*
was
still
in
Lyme
;
and
she
was
thinking
of
them
all
very
intently
one
*NL*
evening
,
when
a
thicker
letter
than
usual
from
Mary
was
delivered
to
*NL*
her
;
and
,
to
quicken
the
pleasure
and
surprise
,
with
Admiral
and
Mrs
*NL*
Croft
's
compliments
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Crofts
must
be
in
Bath
!
A
circumstance
to
interest
her
.
They
were
*NL*
people
whom
her
heart
turned
to
very
naturally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
?
''
cried
Sir
Walter
.
``
The
Crofts
have
arrived
in
Bath
?
*NL*
The
Crofts
who
rent
Kellynch
?
What
have
they
brought
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
letter
from
Uppercross
Cottage
,
Sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
those
letters
are
convenient
passports
.
They
secure
an
*NL*
introduction
.
I
should
have
visited
Admiral
Croft
,
however
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
.
I
know
what
is
due
to
my
tenant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
could
listen
no
longer
;
she
could
not
even
have
told
how
the
poor
*NL*
Admiral
's
complexion
escaped
;
her
letter
engrossed
her
.
It
had
been
*NL*
begun
several
days
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
February
1st

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Anne
,
--
I
make
no
apology
for
my
silence
,
because
I
know
how
*NL*
little
people
think
of
letters
in
such
a
place
as
Bath
.
You
must
be
a
*NL*
great
deal
too
happy
to
care
for
Uppercross
,
which
,
as
you
well
know
,
*NL*
affords
little
to
write
about
.
We
have
had
a
very
dull
Christmas
;
Mr
*NL*
and
Mrs
Musgrove
have
not
had
one
dinner
party
all
the
holidays
.
I
do
*NL*
not
reckon
the
Hayters
as
anybody
.
The
holidays
,
however
,
are
over
at
*NL*
last
:
I
believe
no
children
ever
had
such
long
ones
.
I
am
sure
I
had
*NL*
not
.
The
house
was
cleared
yesterday
,
except
of
the
little
Harvilles
;
*NL*
but
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
they
have
never
gone
home
.
Mrs
*NL*
Harville
must
be
an
odd
mother
to
part
with
them
so
long
.
I
do
not
*NL*
understand
it
.
They
are
not
at
all
nice
children
,
in
my
opinion
;
but
*NL*
Mrs
Musgrove
seems
to
like
them
quite
as
well
,
if
not
better
,
than
her
*NL*
grandchildren
.
What
dreadful
weather
we
have
had
!
It
may
not
be
felt
*NL*
in
Bath
,
with
your
nice
pavements
;
but
in
the
country
it
is
of
some
*NL*
consequence
.
I
have
not
had
a
creature
call
on
me
since
the
second
*NL*
week
in
January
,
except
Charles
Hayter
,
who
had
been
calling
much
*NL*
oftener
than
was
welcome
.
Between
ourselves
,
I
think
it
a
great
pity
*NL*
Henrietta
did
not
remain
at
Lyme
as
long
as
Louisa
;
it
would
have
kept
*NL*
her
a
little
out
of
his
way
.
The
carriage
is
gone
to-day
,
to
bring
*NL*
Louisa
and
the
Harvilles
to-morrow
.
We
are
not
asked
to
dine
with
*NL*
them
,
however
,
till
the
day
after
,
Mrs
Musgrove
is
so
afraid
of
her
*NL*
being
fatigued
by
the
journey
,
which
is
not
very
likely
,
considering
*NL*
the
care
that
will
be
taken
of
her
;
and
it
would
be
much
more
*NL*
convenient
to
me
to
dine
there
to-morrow
.
I
am
glad
you
find
Mr
Elliot
*NL*
so
agreeable
,
and
wish
I
could
be
acquainted
with
him
too
;
but
I
have
*NL*
my
usual
luck
:
I
am
always
out
of
the
way
when
any
thing
desirable
is
*NL*
going
on
;
always
the
last
of
my
family
to
be
noticed
.
What
an
immense
*NL*
time
Mrs
Clay
has
been
staying
with
Elizabeth
!
Does
she
never
mean
to
*NL*
go
away
?
But
perhaps
if
she
were
to
leave
the
room
vacant
,
we
might
*NL*
not
be
invited
.
Let
me
know
what
you
think
of
this
.
I
do
not
expect
*NL*
my
children
to
be
asked
,
you
know
.
I
can
leave
them
at
the
Great
House
*NL*
very
well
,
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
.
I
have
this
moment
heard
that
the
*NL*
Crofts
are
going
to
Bath
almost
immediately
;
they
think
the
Admiral
*NL*
gouty
.
Charles
heard
it
quite
by
chance
;
they
have
not
had
the
*NL*
civility
to
give
me
any
notice
,
or
of
offering
to
take
anything
.
I
do
*NL*
not
think
they
improve
at
all
as
neighbours
.
We
see
nothing
of
them
,
*NL*
and
this
is
really
an
instance
of
gross
inattention
.
Charles
joins
me
*NL*
in
love
,
and
everything
proper
.
Yours
affectionately
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
M

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
I
am
very
far
from
well
;
and
Jemima
has
just
*NL*
told
me
that
the
butcher
says
there
is
a
bad
sore-throat
very
much
*NL*
about
.
I
dare
say
I
shall
catch
it
;
and
my
sore-throats
,
you
know
,
are
*NL*
always
worse
than
anybody
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
ended
the
first
part
,
which
had
been
afterwards
put
into
an
*NL*
envelope
,
containing
nearly
as
much
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
kept
my
letter
open
,
that
I
might
send
you
word
how
Louisa
bore
her
*NL*
journey
,
and
now
I
am
extremely
glad
I
did
,
having
a
great
deal
to
add
.
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
I
had
a
note
from
Mrs
Croft
yesterday
,
offering
to
*NL*
convey
anything
to
you
;
a
very
kind
,
friendly
note
indeed
,
addressed
to
*NL*
me
,
just
as
it
ought
;
I
shall
therefore
be
able
to
make
my
letter
as
*NL*
long
as
I
like
.
The
Admiral
does
not
seem
very
ill
,
and
I
sincerely
*NL*
hope
Bath
will
do
him
all
the
good
he
wants
.
I
shall
be
truly
glad
to
*NL*
have
them
back
again
.
Our
neighbourhood
can
not
spare
such
a
pleasant
*NL*
family
.
But
now
for
Louisa
.
I
have
something
to
communicate
that
will
*NL*
astonish
you
not
a
little
.
She
and
the
Harvilles
came
on
Tuesday
very
*NL*
safely
,
and
in
the
evening
we
went
to
ask
her
how
she
did
,
when
we
were
*NL*
rather
surprised
not
to
find
Captain
Benwick
of
the
party
,
for
he
had
*NL*
been
invited
as
well
as
the
Harvilles
;
and
what
do
you
think
was
the
*NL*
reason
?
Neither
more
nor
less
than
his
being
in
love
with
Louisa
,
and
*NL*
not
choosing
to
venture
to
Uppercross
till
he
had
had
an
answer
from
Mr
*NL*
Musgrove
;
for
it
was
all
settled
between
him
and
her
before
she
came
*NL*
away
,
and
he
had
written
to
her
father
by
Captain
Harville
.
True
,
upon
*NL*
my
honour
!
Are
not
you
astonished
?
I
shall
be
surprised
at
least
if
*NL*
you
ever
received
a
hint
of
it
,
for
I
never
did
.
Mrs
Musgrove
protests
*NL*
solemnly
that
she
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
.
We
are
all
very
well
*NL*
pleased
,
however
,
for
though
it
is
not
equal
to
her
marrying
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
,
it
is
infinitely
better
than
Charles
Hayter
;
and
Mr
Musgrove
*NL*
has
written
his
consent
,
and
Captain
Benwick
is
expected
to-day
.
Mrs
*NL*
Harville
says
her
husband
feels
a
good
deal
on
his
poor
sister
's
*NL*
account
;
but
,
however
,
Louisa
is
a
great
favourite
with
both
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
Mrs
Harville
and
I
quite
agree
that
we
love
her
the
better
for
having
*NL*
nursed
her
.
Charles
wonders
what
Captain
Wentworth
will
say
;
but
if
*NL*
you
remember
,
I
never
thought
him
attached
to
Louisa
;
I
never
could
see
*NL*
anything
of
it
.
And
this
is
the
end
,
you
see
,
of
Captain
Benwick
's
*NL*
being
supposed
to
be
an
admirer
of
yours
.
How
Charles
could
take
such
*NL*
a
thing
into
his
head
was
always
incomprehensible
to
me
.
I
hope
he
*NL*
will
be
more
agreeable
now
.
Certainly
not
a
great
match
for
Louisa
*NL*
Musgrove
,
but
a
million
times
better
than
marrying
among
the
Hayters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
need
not
have
feared
her
sister
's
being
in
any
degree
prepared
for
*NL*
the
news
.
She
had
never
in
her
life
been
more
astonished
.
Captain
*NL*
Benwick
and
Louisa
Musgrove
!
It
was
almost
too
wonderful
for
belief
,
*NL*
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
effort
that
she
could
remain
in
the
room
,
*NL*
preserve
an
air
of
calmness
,
and
answer
the
common
questions
of
the
*NL*
moment
.
Happily
for
her
,
they
were
not
many
.
Sir
Walter
wanted
to
*NL*
know
whether
the
Crofts
travelled
with
four
horses
,
and
whether
they
*NL*
were
likely
to
be
situated
in
such
a
part
of
Bath
as
it
might
suit
Miss
*NL*
Elliot
and
himself
to
visit
in
;
but
had
little
curiosity
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
Mary
?
''
said
Elizabeth
;
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
,
``
And
*NL*
pray
what
brings
the
Crofts
to
Bath
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
come
on
the
Admiral
's
account
.
He
is
thought
to
be
gouty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gout
and
decrepitude
!
''
said
Sir
Walter
.
``
Poor
old
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
they
any
acquaintance
here
?
''
asked
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
can
hardly
suppose
that
,
at
Admiral
Croft
's
time
*NL*
of
life
,
and
in
his
profession
,
he
should
not
have
many
acquaintance
in
*NL*
such
a
place
as
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
,
''
said
Sir
Walter
coolly
,
``
that
Admiral
Croft
will
be
best
*NL*
known
in
Bath
as
the
renter
of
Kellynch
Hall
.
Elizabeth
,
may
we
*NL*
venture
to
present
him
and
his
wife
in
Laura
Place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
I
think
not
.
Situated
as
we
are
with
Lady
Dalrymple
,
cousins
,
*NL*
we
ought
to
be
very
careful
not
to
embarrass
her
with
acquaintance
she
*NL*
might
not
approve
.
If
we
were
not
related
,
it
would
not
signify
;
but
*NL*
as
cousins
,
she
would
feel
scrupulous
as
to
any
proposal
of
ours
.
We
*NL*
had
better
leave
the
Crofts
to
find
their
own
level
.
There
are
several
*NL*
odd-looking
men
walking
about
here
,
who
,
I
am
told
,
are
sailors
.
The
*NL*
Crofts
will
associate
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
's
share
of
interest
in
the
letter
;
*NL*
when
Mrs
Clay
had
paid
her
tribute
of
more
decent
attention
,
in
an
*NL*
enquiry
after
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
,
and
her
fine
little
boys
,
Anne
was
*NL*
at
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
own
room
,
she
tried
to
comprehend
it
.
Well
might
Charles
wonder
*NL*
how
Captain
Wentworth
would
feel
!
Perhaps
he
had
quitted
the
field
,
*NL*
had
given
Louisa
up
,
had
ceased
to
love
,
had
found
he
did
not
love
her
.
*NL*
She
could
not
endure
the
idea
of
treachery
or
levity
,
or
anything
akin
*NL*
to
ill
usage
between
him
and
his
friend
.
She
could
not
endure
that
*NL*
such
a
friendship
as
theirs
should
be
severed
unfairly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Benwick
and
Louisa
Musgrove
!
The
high-spirited
,
joyous-talking
*NL*
Louisa
Musgrove
,
and
the
dejected
,
thinking
,
feeling
,
reading
,
Captain
*NL*
Benwick
,
seemed
each
of
them
everything
that
would
not
suit
the
other
.
*NL*
Their
minds
most
dissimilar
!
Where
could
have
been
the
attraction
?
*NL*
The
answer
soon
presented
itself
.
It
had
been
in
situation
.
They
had
*NL*
been
thrown
together
several
weeks
;
they
had
been
living
in
the
same
*NL*
small
family
party
:
since
Henrietta
's
coming
away
,
they
must
have
been
*NL*
depending
almost
entirely
on
each
other
,
and
Louisa
,
just
recovering
*NL*
from
illness
,
had
been
in
an
interesting
state
,
and
Captain
Benwick
was
*NL*
not
inconsolable
.
That
was
a
point
which
Anne
had
not
been
able
to
*NL*
avoid
suspecting
before
;
and
instead
of
drawing
the
same
conclusion
as
*NL*
Mary
,
from
the
present
course
of
events
,
they
served
only
to
confirm
*NL*
the
idea
of
his
having
felt
some
dawning
of
tenderness
toward
herself
.
*NL*
She
did
not
mean
,
however
,
to
derive
much
more
from
it
to
gratify
her
*NL*
vanity
,
than
Mary
might
have
allowed
.
She
was
persuaded
that
any
*NL*
tolerably
pleasing
young
woman
who
had
listened
and
seemed
to
feel
for
*NL*
him
would
have
received
the
same
compliment
.
He
had
an
affectionate
*NL*
heart
.
He
must
love
somebody
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
no
reason
against
their
being
happy
.
Louisa
had
fine
naval
*NL*
fervour
to
begin
with
,
and
they
would
soon
grow
more
alike
.
He
would
*NL*
gain
cheerfulness
,
and
she
would
learn
to
be
an
enthusiast
for
Scott
*NL*
and
Lord
Byron
;
nay
,
that
was
probably
learnt
already
;
of
course
they
*NL*
had
fallen
in
love
over
poetry
.
The
idea
of
Louisa
Musgrove
turned
*NL*
into
a
person
of
literary
taste
,
and
sentimental
reflection
was
*NL*
amusing
,
but
she
had
no
doubt
of
its
being
so
.
The
day
at
Lyme
,
the
*NL*
fall
from
the
Cobb
,
might
influence
her
health
,
her
nerves
,
her
*NL*
courage
,
her
character
to
the
end
of
her
life
,
as
thoroughly
as
it
*NL*
appeared
to
have
influenced
her
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conclusion
of
the
whole
was
,
that
if
the
woman
who
had
been
*NL*
sensible
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
merits
could
be
allowed
to
prefer
*NL*
another
man
,
there
was
nothing
in
the
engagement
to
excite
lasting
*NL*
wonder
;
and
if
Captain
Wentworth
lost
no
friend
by
it
,
certainly
*NL*
nothing
to
be
regretted
.
No
,
it
was
not
regret
which
made
Anne
's
heart
*NL*
beat
in
spite
of
herself
,
and
brought
the
colour
into
her
cheeks
when
*NL*
she
thought
of
Captain
Wentworth
unshackled
and
free
.
She
had
some
*NL*
feelings
which
she
was
ashamed
to
investigate
.
They
were
too
much
like
*NL*
joy
,
senseless
joy
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
longed
to
see
the
Crofts
;
but
when
the
meeting
took
place
,
it
was
*NL*
evident
that
no
rumour
of
the
news
had
yet
reached
them
.
The
visit
of
*NL*
ceremony
was
paid
and
returned
;
and
Louisa
Musgrove
was
mentioned
,
and
*NL*
Captain
Benwick
,
too
,
without
even
half
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Crofts
had
placed
themselves
in
lodgings
in
Gay
Street
,
perfectly
*NL*
to
Sir
Walter
's
satisfaction
.
He
was
not
at
all
ashamed
of
the
*NL*
acquaintance
,
and
did
,
in
fact
,
think
and
talk
a
great
deal
more
about
*NL*
the
Admiral
,
than
the
Admiral
ever
thought
or
talked
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Crofts
knew
quite
as
many
people
in
Bath
as
they
wished
for
,
and
*NL*
considered
their
intercourse
with
the
Elliots
as
a
mere
matter
of
form
,
*NL*
and
not
in
the
least
likely
to
afford
them
any
pleasure
.
They
brought
*NL*
with
them
their
country
habit
of
being
almost
always
together
.
He
was
*NL*
ordered
to
walk
to
keep
off
the
gout
,
and
Mrs
Croft
seemed
to
go
shares
*NL*
with
him
in
everything
,
and
to
walk
for
her
life
to
do
him
good
.
Anne
*NL*
saw
them
wherever
she
went
.
Lady
Russell
took
her
out
in
her
carriage
*NL*
almost
every
morning
,
and
she
never
failed
to
think
of
them
,
and
never
*NL*
failed
to
see
them
.
Knowing
their
feelings
as
she
did
,
it
was
a
most
*NL*
attractive
picture
of
happiness
to
her
.
She
always
watched
them
as
*NL*
long
as
she
could
,
delighted
to
fancy
she
understood
what
they
might
be
*NL*
talking
of
,
as
they
walked
along
in
happy
independence
,
or
equally
*NL*
delighted
to
see
the
Admiral
's
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
when
he
*NL*
encountered
an
old
friend
,
and
observe
their
eagerness
of
conversation
*NL*
when
occasionally
forming
into
a
little
knot
of
the
navy
,
Mrs
Croft
*NL*
looking
as
intelligent
and
keen
as
any
of
the
officers
around
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
too
much
engaged
with
Lady
Russell
to
be
often
walking
*NL*
herself
;
but
it
so
happened
that
one
morning
,
about
a
week
or
ten
days
*NL*
after
the
Croft
's
arrival
,
it
suited
her
best
to
leave
her
friend
,
or
*NL*
her
friend
's
carriage
,
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
,
and
return
alone
*NL*
to
Camden
Place
,
and
in
walking
up
Milsom
Street
she
had
the
good
*NL*
fortune
to
meet
with
the
Admiral
.
He
was
standing
by
himself
at
a
*NL*
printshop
window
,
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
in
earnest
contemplation
*NL*
of
some
print
,
and
she
not
only
might
have
passed
him
unseen
,
but
was
*NL*
obliged
to
touch
as
well
as
address
him
before
she
could
catch
his
*NL*
notice
.
When
he
did
perceive
and
acknowledge
her
,
however
,
it
was
done
*NL*
with
all
his
usual
frankness
and
good
humour
.
``
Ha
!
is
it
you
?
Thank
*NL*
you
,
thank
you
.
This
is
treating
me
like
a
friend
.
Here
I
am
,
you
*NL*
see
,
staring
at
a
picture
.
I
can
never
get
by
this
shop
without
*NL*
stopping
.
But
what
a
thing
here
is
,
by
way
of
a
boat
!
Do
look
at
it
.
*NL*
Did
you
ever
see
the
like
?
What
queer
fellows
your
fine
painters
must
*NL*
be
,
to
think
that
anybody
would
venture
their
lives
in
such
a
shapeless
*NL*
old
cockleshell
as
that
?
And
yet
here
are
two
gentlemen
stuck
up
in
it
*NL*
mightily
at
their
ease
,
and
looking
about
them
at
the
rocks
and
*NL*
mountains
,
as
if
they
were
not
to
be
upset
the
next
moment
,
which
they
*NL*
certainly
must
be
.
I
wonder
where
that
boat
was
built
!
''
-LRB-
laughing
*NL*
heartily
-RRB-
;
``
I
would
not
venture
over
a
horsepond
in
it
.
Well
,
''
*NL*
-LRB-
turning
away
-RRB-
,
``
now
,
where
are
you
bound
?
Can
I
go
anywhere
for
you
,
*NL*
or
with
you
?
Can
I
be
of
any
use
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
,
I
thank
you
,
unless
you
will
give
me
the
pleasure
of
your
*NL*
company
the
little
way
our
road
lies
together
.
I
am
going
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
,
with
all
my
heart
,
and
farther
,
too

Yes
,
yes
we
will
*NL*
have
a
snug
walk
together
,
and
I
have
something
to
tell
you
as
we
go
*NL*
along
.
There
,
take
my
arm
;
that
's
right
;
I
do
not
feel
comfortable
if
*NL*
I
have
not
a
woman
there
.
Lord
!
what
a
boat
it
is
!
''
taking
a
last
look
*NL*
at
the
picture
,
as
they
began
to
be
in
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
say
that
you
had
something
to
tell
me
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
,
presently
.
But
here
comes
a
friend
,
Captain
Brigden
;
I
*NL*
shall
only
say
,
`
How
d'ye
do
?
'
as
we
pass
,
however
.
I
shall
not
stop
.
*NL*
`
How
d'ye
do
?
'
Brigden
stares
to
see
anybody
with
me
but
my
wife
.
*NL*
She
,
poor
soul
,
is
tied
by
the
leg
.
She
has
a
blister
on
one
of
her
*NL*
heels
,
as
large
as
a
three-shilling
piece
.
If
you
look
across
the
*NL*
street
,
you
will
see
Admiral
Brand
coming
down
and
his
brother
.
Shabby
*NL*
fellows
,
both
of
them
!
I
am
glad
they
are
not
on
this
side
of
the
way
.
*NL*
Sophy
can
not
bear
them
.
They
played
me
a
pitiful
trick
once
:
got
away
*NL*
with
some
of
my
best
men
.
I
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
another
*NL*
time
.
There
comes
old
Sir
Archibald
Drew
and
his
grandson
.
Look
,
he
*NL*
sees
us
;
he
kisses
his
hand
to
you
;
he
takes
you
for
my
wife
.
Ah
!
the
*NL*
peace
has
come
too
soon
for
that
younker
.
Poor
old
Sir
Archibald
!
How
*NL*
do
you
like
Bath
,
Miss
Elliot
?
It
suits
us
very
well
.
We
are
always
*NL*
meeting
with
some
old
friend
or
other
;
the
streets
full
of
them
every
*NL*
morning
;
sure
to
have
plenty
of
chat
;
and
then
we
get
away
from
them
*NL*
all
,
and
shut
ourselves
in
our
lodgings
,
and
draw
in
our
chairs
,
and
*NL*
are
as
snug
as
if
we
were
at
Kellynch
,
ay
,
or
as
we
used
to
be
even
at
*NL*
North
Yarmouth
and
Deal
.
We
do
not
like
our
lodgings
here
the
worse
,
I
*NL*
can
tell
you
,
for
putting
us
in
mind
of
those
we
first
had
at
North
*NL*
Yarmouth
.
The
wind
blows
through
one
of
the
cupboards
just
in
the
same
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
got
a
little
farther
,
Anne
ventured
to
press
again
for
*NL*
what
he
had
to
communicate
.
She
hoped
when
clear
of
Milsom
Street
to
*NL*
have
her
curiosity
gratified
;
but
she
was
still
obliged
to
wait
,
for
*NL*
the
Admiral
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
begin
till
they
had
gained
the
*NL*
greater
space
and
quiet
of
Belmont
;
and
as
she
was
not
really
Mrs
*NL*
Croft
,
she
must
let
him
have
his
own
way
.
As
soon
as
they
were
fairly
*NL*
ascending
Belmont
,
he
began
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
you
shall
hear
something
that
will
surprise
you
.
But
first
*NL*
of
all
,
you
must
tell
me
the
name
of
the
young
lady
I
am
going
to
talk
*NL*
about
.
That
young
lady
,
you
know
,
that
we
have
all
been
so
concerned
*NL*
for
.
The
Miss
Musgrove
,
that
all
this
has
been
happening
to
.
Her
*NL*
Christian
name
:
I
always
forget
her
Christian
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
been
ashamed
to
appear
to
comprehend
so
soon
as
she
really
*NL*
did
;
but
now
she
could
safely
suggest
the
name
of
``
Louisa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
Miss
Louisa
Musgrove
,
that
is
the
name
.
I
wish
young
ladies
*NL*
had
not
such
a
number
of
fine
Christian
names
.
I
should
never
be
out
*NL*
if
they
were
all
Sophys
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
Well
,
this
Miss
*NL*
Louisa
,
we
all
thought
,
you
know
,
was
to
marry
Frederick
.
He
was
*NL*
courting
her
week
after
week
.
The
only
wonder
was
,
what
they
could
be
*NL*
waiting
for
,
till
the
business
at
Lyme
came
;
then
,
indeed
,
it
was
clear
*NL*
enough
that
they
must
wait
till
her
brain
was
set
to
right
.
But
even
*NL*
then
there
was
something
odd
in
their
way
of
going
on
.
Instead
of
*NL*
staying
at
Lyme
,
he
went
off
to
Plymouth
,
and
then
he
went
off
to
see
*NL*
Edward
.
When
we
came
back
from
Minehead
he
was
gone
down
to
Edward
's
,
*NL*
and
there
he
has
been
ever
since
.
We
have
seen
nothing
of
him
since
*NL*
November
.
Even
Sophy
could
not
understand
it
.
But
now
,
the
matter
has
*NL*
taken
the
strangest
turn
of
all
;
for
this
young
lady
,
the
same
Miss
*NL*
Musgrove
,
instead
of
being
to
marry
Frederick
,
is
to
marry
James
*NL*
Benwick
.
You
know
James
Benwick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
.
I
am
a
little
acquainted
with
Captain
Benwick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
is
to
marry
him
.
Nay
,
most
likely
they
are
married
already
,
*NL*
for
I
do
not
know
what
they
should
wait
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
Captain
Benwick
a
very
pleasing
young
man
,
''
said
Anne
,
``
and
*NL*
I
understand
that
he
bears
an
excellent
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
,
yes
,
there
is
not
a
word
to
be
said
against
James
Benwick
.
*NL*
He
is
only
a
commander
,
it
is
true
,
made
last
summer
,
and
these
are
bad
*NL*
times
for
getting
on
,
but
he
has
not
another
fault
that
I
know
of
.
An
*NL*
excellent
,
good-hearted
fellow
,
I
assure
you
;
a
very
active
,
zealous
*NL*
officer
too
,
which
is
more
than
you
would
think
for
,
perhaps
,
for
that
*NL*
soft
sort
of
manner
does
not
do
him
justice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
are
mistaken
there
,
sir
;
I
should
never
augur
want
of
*NL*
spirit
from
Captain
Benwick
's
manners
.
I
thought
them
particularly
*NL*
pleasing
,
and
I
will
answer
for
it
,
they
would
generally
please

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
ladies
are
the
best
judges
;
but
James
Benwick
is
rather
*NL*
too
piano
for
me
;
and
though
very
likely
it
is
all
our
partiality
,
*NL*
Sophy
and
I
can
not
help
thinking
Frederick
's
manners
better
than
his
.
*NL*
There
is
something
about
Frederick
more
to
our
taste

''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
caught
.
She
had
only
meant
to
oppose
the
too
common
idea
of
*NL*
spirit
and
gentleness
being
incompatible
with
each
other
,
not
at
all
to
*NL*
represent
Captain
Benwick
's
manners
as
the
very
best
that
could
*NL*
possibly
be
;
and
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
she
was
beginning
to
say
,
*NL*
``
I
was
not
entering
into
any
comparison
of
the
two
friends
,
''
but
the
*NL*
Admiral
interrupted
her
with
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
thing
is
certainly
true
.
It
is
not
a
mere
bit
of
gossip
.
We
*NL*
have
it
from
Frederick
himself
.
His
sister
had
a
letter
from
him
*NL*
yesterday
,
in
which
he
tells
us
of
it
,
and
he
had
just
had
it
in
a
*NL*
letter
from
Harville
,
written
upon
the
spot
,
from
Uppercross
.
I
fancy
*NL*
they
are
all
at
Uppercross
.

*NL*
*NL*
This
was
an
opportunity
which
Anne
could
not
resist
;
she
said
,
*NL*
therefore
,
``
I
hope
,
Admiral
,
I
hope
there
is
nothing
in
the
style
of
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
's
letter
to
make
you
and
Mrs
Croft
particularly
*NL*
uneasy
.
It
did
seem
,
last
autumn
,
as
if
there
were
an
attachment
*NL*
between
him
and
Louisa
Musgrove
;
but
I
hope
it
may
be
understood
to
*NL*
have
worn
out
on
each
side
equally
,
and
without
violence
.
I
hope
his
*NL*
letter
does
not
breathe
the
spirit
of
an
ill-used
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
not
at
all

there
is
not
an
oath
or
a
murmur
from

beginning
to
end

*NL*
Anne
looked
down
to
hide
her
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
Frederick
is
not
a
man
to
whine
and
complain
;
he
has
too
much
*NL*
spirit
for
that
.
If
the
girl
likes
another
man
better
,
it
is
very
fit
*NL*
she
should
have
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
But
what
I
mean
is
,
that
I
hope
there
is
nothing
in
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
's
manner
of
writing
to
make
you
suppose
he
thinks
*NL*
himself
ill-used
by
his
friend
,
which
might
appear
,
you
know
,
without
*NL*
its
being
absolutely
said
.
I
should
be
very
sorry
that
such
a
*NL*
friendship
as
has
subsisted
between
him
and
Captain
Benwick
should
be
*NL*
destroyed
,

even
wounded
,
by
a
circumstance
of
this
sort

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
understand
you

But
there
is
nothing
at
all
of
that
*NL*
nature
in
the
letter

He
does
not
give
the
least
fling
at
Benwick
;
*NL*
does
not
so
much
as
say
,
'
I
wonder
at
it
,
I
have
a
reason
of
my
own
for
*NL*
wondering
at
it

'
No
,
you
would
not
guess
,
from
his
way
of
writing
,
*NL*
that
he
had
ever
thought
of
this
Miss
-LRB-
what
's
her
name
?
-RRB-
for
himself
.
*NL*
He
very
handsomely
hopes
they
will
be
happy
together
;
and
there
is
*NL*
nothing
very
unforgiving
in
that
,
I
think

''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
did
not
receive
the
perfect
conviction
which
the
Admiral
meant
to
*NL*
convey
,
but
it
would
have
been
useless
to
press
the
enquiry
farther
.
*NL*
She
therefore
satisfied
herself
with
common-place
remarks
or
quiet
*NL*
attention
,
and
the
Admiral
had
it
all
his
own
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Frederick

said
he
at
last

Now

begin
all
over
again
*NL*
with
somebody
else
.
I
think
we
must
get
him
to
Bath
.
Sophy
must
*NL*
write
,
and
beg
him
to
come
to
Bath
.
Here
are
pretty
girls
enough
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
.
It
would
be
of
no
use
to
go
to
Uppercross
again
,
for
that
other
*NL*
Miss
Musgrove
,
I
find
,
is
bespoke
by
her
cousin
,
the
young
parson
.
Do
*NL*
not
you
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
we
had
better
try
to
get
him
to
Bath
?

Chapter
19
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Admiral
Croft
was
taking
this
walk
with
Anne
,
and
expressing
his
*NL*
wish
of
getting
Captain
Wentworth
to
Bath
,
Captain
Wentworth
was
*NL*
already
on
his
way
thither
.
Before
Mrs
Croft
had
written
,
he
was
*NL*
arrived
,
and
the
very
next
time
Anne
walked
out
,
she
saw
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
was
attending
his
two
cousins
and
Mrs
Clay
.
They
were
in
*NL*
Milsom
Street
.
It
began
to
rain
,
not
much
,
but
enough
to
make
shelter
*NL*
desirable
for
women
,
and
quite
enough
to
make
it
very
desirable
for
*NL*
Miss
Elliot
to
have
the
advantage
of
being
conveyed
home
in
Lady
*NL*
Dalrymple
's
carriage
,
which
was
seen
waiting
at
a
little
distance
;
she
,
*NL*
Anne
,
and
Mrs
Clay
,
therefore
,
turned
into
Molland
's
,
while
Mr
Elliot
*NL*
stepped
to
Lady
Dalrymple
,
to
request
her
assistance
.
He
soon
joined
*NL*
them
again
,
successful
,
of
course
;
Lady
Dalrymple
would
be
most
happy
*NL*
to
take
them
home
,
and
would
call
for
them
in
a
few
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
ladyship
's
carriage
was
a
barouche
,
and
did
not
hold
more
than
four
*NL*
with
any
comfort
.
Miss
Carteret
was
with
her
mother
;
consequently
it
*NL*
was
not
reasonable
to
expect
accommodation
for
all
the
three
Camden
*NL*
Place
ladies
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
Miss
Elliot
.
Whoever
*NL*
suffered
inconvenience
,
she
must
suffer
none
,
but
it
occupied
a
little
*NL*
time
to
settle
the
point
of
civility
between
the
other
two
.
The
rain
*NL*
was
a
mere
trifle
,
and
Anne
was
most
sincere
in
preferring
a
walk
with
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
.
But
the
rain
was
also
a
mere
trifle
to
Mrs
Clay
;
she
would
*NL*
hardly
allow
it
even
to
drop
at
all
,
and
her
boots
were
so
thick
!
much
*NL*
thicker
than
Miss
Anne
's
;
and
,
in
short
,
her
civility
rendered
her
*NL*
quite
as
anxious
to
be
left
to
walk
with
Mr
Elliot
as
Anne
could
be
,
*NL*
and
it
was
discussed
between
them
with
a
generosity
so
polite
and
so
*NL*
determined
,
that
the
others
were
obliged
to
settle
it
for
them
;
Miss
*NL*
Elliot
maintaining
that
Mrs
Clay
had
a
little
cold
already
,
and
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
deciding
on
appeal
,
that
his
cousin
Anne
's
boots
were
rather
the
*NL*
thickest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fixed
accordingly
,
that
Mrs
Clay
should
be
of
the
party
in
the
*NL*
carriage
;
and
they
had
just
reached
this
point
,
when
Anne
,
as
she
sat
*NL*
near
the
window
,
descried
,
most
decidedly
and
distinctly
,
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
walking
down
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
start
was
perceptible
only
to
herself
;
but
she
instantly
felt
that
*NL*
she
was
the
greatest
simpleton
in
the
world
,
the
most
unaccountable
and
*NL*
absurd
!
For
a
few
minutes
she
saw
nothing
before
her
;
it
was
all
*NL*
confusion
.
She
was
lost
,
and
when
she
had
scolded
back
her
senses
,
she
*NL*
found
the
others
still
waiting
for
the
carriage
,
and
Mr
Elliot
-LRB-
always
*NL*
obliging
-RRB-
just
setting
off
for
Union
Street
on
a
commission
of
Mrs
*NL*
Clay
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
now
felt
a
great
inclination
to
go
to
the
outer
door
;
she
wanted
to
*NL*
see
if
it
rained
.
Why
was
she
to
suspect
herself
of
another
motive
?
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
must
be
out
of
sight
.
She
left
her
seat
,
she
would
*NL*
go
;
one
half
of
her
should
not
be
always
so
much
wiser
than
the
other
*NL*
half
,
or
always
suspecting
the
other
of
being
worse
than
it
was
.
She
*NL*
would
see
if
it
rained
.
She
was
sent
back
,
however
,
in
a
moment
by
the
*NL*
entrance
of
Captain
Wentworth
himself
,
among
a
party
of
gentlemen
and
*NL*
ladies
,
evidently
his
acquaintance
,
and
whom
he
must
have
joined
a
*NL*
little
below
Milsom
Street
.
He
was
more
obviously
struck
and
confused
*NL*
by
the
sight
of
her
than
she
had
ever
observed
before
;
he
looked
quite
*NL*
red
.
For
the
first
time
,
since
their
renewed
acquaintance
,
she
felt
*NL*
that
she
was
betraying
the
least
sensibility
of
the
two
.
She
had
the
*NL*
advantage
of
him
in
the
preparation
of
the
last
few
moments
.
All
the
*NL*
overpowering
,
blinding
,
bewildering
,
first
effects
of
strong
surprise
*NL*
were
over
with
her
.
Still
,
however
,
she
had
enough
to
feel
!
It
was
*NL*
agitation
,
pain
,
pleasure
,
a
something
between
delight
and
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
to
her
,
and
then
turned
away
.
The
character
of
his
manner
was
*NL*
embarrassment
.
She
could
not
have
called
it
either
cold
or
friendly
,
*NL*
or
anything
so
certainly
as
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
interval
,
however
,
he
came
towards
her
,
and
spoke
again
.
*NL*
Mutual
enquiries
on
common
subjects
passed
:
neither
of
them
,
probably
,
*NL*
much
the
wiser
for
what
they
heard
,
and
Anne
continuing
fully
sensible
*NL*
of
his
being
less
at
ease
than
formerly
.
They
had
by
dint
of
being
so
*NL*
very
much
together
,
got
to
speak
to
each
other
with
a
considerable
*NL*
portion
of
apparent
indifference
and
calmness
;
but
he
could
not
do
it
*NL*
now
.
Time
had
changed
him
,
or
Louisa
had
changed
him
.
There
was
*NL*
consciousness
of
some
sort
or
other
.
He
looked
very
well
,
not
as
if
he
*NL*
had
been
suffering
in
health
or
spirits
,
and
he
talked
of
Uppercross
,
*NL*
of
the
Musgroves
,
nay
,
even
of
Louisa
,
and
had
even
a
momentary
look
of
*NL*
his
own
arch
significance
as
he
named
her
;
but
yet
it
was
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
not
comfortable
,
not
easy
,
not
able
to
feign
that
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
surprise
,
but
it
grieved
Anne
to
observe
that
Elizabeth
*NL*
would
not
know
him
.
She
saw
that
he
saw
Elizabeth
,
that
Elizabeth
saw
*NL*
him
,
that
there
was
complete
internal
recognition
on
each
side
;
she
was
*NL*
convinced
that
he
was
ready
to
be
acknowledged
as
an
acquaintance
,
*NL*
expecting
it
,
and
she
had
the
pain
of
seeing
her
sister
turn
away
with
*NL*
unalterable
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Dalrymple
's
carriage
,
for
which
Miss
Elliot
was
growing
very
*NL*
impatient
,
now
drew
up
;
the
servant
came
in
to
announce
it
.
It
was
*NL*
beginning
to
rain
again
,
and
altogether
there
was
a
delay
,
and
a
*NL*
bustle
,
and
a
talking
,
which
must
make
all
the
little
crowd
in
the
shop
*NL*
understand
that
Lady
Dalrymple
was
calling
to
convey
Miss
Elliot
.
At
*NL*
last
Miss
Elliot
and
her
friend
,
unattended
but
by
the
servant
,
-LRB-
for
*NL*
there
was
no
cousin
returned
-RRB-
,
were
walking
off
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
*NL*
watching
them
,
turned
again
to
Anne
,
and
by
manner
,
rather
than
words
,
*NL*
was
offering
his
services
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
''
was
her
answer
,
``
but
I
am
not
going
with
*NL*
them
.
The
carriage
would
not
accommodate
so
many
.
I
walk
:
I
prefer
*NL*
walking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
rains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
very
little
,
Nothing
that
I
regard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
pause
he
said
:
``
Though
I
came
only
yesterday
,
I
have
*NL*
equipped
myself
properly
for
Bath
already
,
you
see
,
''
-LRB-
pointing
to
a
new
*NL*
umbrella
-RRB-
;
``
I
wish
you
would
make
use
of
it
,
if
you
are
determined
to
*NL*
walk
;
though
I
think
it
would
be
more
prudent
to
let
me
get
you
a
*NL*
chair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
much
obliged
to
him
,
but
declined
it
all
,
repeating
her
*NL*
conviction
,
that
the
rain
would
come
to
nothing
at
present
,
and
adding
,
*NL*
``
I
am
only
waiting
for
Mr
Elliot
.
He
will
be
here
in
a
moment
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
hardly
spoken
the
words
when
Mr
Elliot
walked
in
.
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
recollected
him
perfectly
.
There
was
no
difference
between
*NL*
him
and
the
man
who
had
stood
on
the
steps
at
Lyme
,
admiring
Anne
as
*NL*
she
passed
,
except
in
the
air
and
look
and
manner
of
the
privileged
*NL*
relation
and
friend
.
He
came
in
with
eagerness
,
appeared
to
see
and
*NL*
think
only
of
her
,
apologised
for
his
stay
,
was
grieved
to
have
kept
*NL*
her
waiting
,
and
anxious
to
get
her
away
without
further
loss
of
time
*NL*
and
before
the
rain
increased
;
and
in
another
moment
they
walked
off
*NL*
together
,
her
arm
under
his
,
a
gentle
and
embarrassed
glance
,
and
a
*NL*
``
Good
morning
to
you
!
''
being
all
that
she
had
time
for
,
as
she
passed
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
,
the
ladies
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
*NL*
party
began
talking
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Elliot
does
not
dislike
his
cousin
,
I
fancy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
no
,
that
is
clear
enough
.
One
can
guess
what
will
happen
there
.
*NL*
He
is
always
with
them
;
half
lives
in
the
family
,
I
believe
.
What
a
*NL*
very
good-looking
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
Miss
Atkinson
,
who
dined
with
him
once
at
the
Wallises
,
says
*NL*
he
is
the
most
agreeable
man
she
ever
was
in
company
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
pretty
,
I
think
;
Anne
Elliot
;
very
pretty
,
when
one
comes
to
*NL*
look
at
her
.
It
is
not
the
fashion
to
say
so
,
but
I
confess
I
admire
*NL*
her
more
than
her
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
so
do
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
do
I.
No
comparison
.
But
the
men
are
all
wild
after
Miss
*NL*
Elliot
.
Anne
is
too
delicate
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
would
have
been
particularly
obliged
to
her
cousin
,
if
he
would
*NL*
have
walked
by
her
side
all
the
way
to
Camden
Place
,
without
saying
a
*NL*
word
.
She
had
never
found
it
so
difficult
to
listen
to
him
,
though
*NL*
nothing
could
exceed
his
solicitude
and
care
,
and
though
his
subjects
*NL*
were
principally
such
as
were
wont
to
be
always
interesting
:
praise
,
*NL*
warm
,
just
,
and
discriminating
,
of
Lady
Russell
,
and
insinuations
*NL*
highly
rational
against
Mrs
Clay
.
But
just
now
she
could
think
only
of
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
.
She
could
not
understand
his
present
feelings
,
*NL*
whether
he
were
really
suffering
much
from
disappointment
or
not
;
and
*NL*
till
that
point
were
settled
,
she
could
not
be
quite
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hoped
to
be
wise
and
reasonable
in
time
;
but
alas
!
alas
!
she
must
*NL*
confess
to
herself
that
she
was
not
wise
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
circumstance
very
essential
for
her
to
know
,
was
how
long
he
*NL*
meant
to
be
in
Bath
;
he
had
not
mentioned
it
,
or
she
could
not
*NL*
recollect
it
.
He
might
be
only
passing
through
.
But
it
was
more
*NL*
probable
that
he
should
be
come
to
stay
.
In
that
case
,
so
liable
as
*NL*
every
body
was
to
meet
every
body
in
Bath
,
Lady
Russell
would
in
all
*NL*
likelihood
see
him
somewhere
.
Would
she
recollect
him
?
How
would
it
*NL*
all
be
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
already
been
obliged
to
tell
Lady
Russell
that
Louisa
Musgrove
*NL*
was
to
marry
Captain
Benwick
.
It
had
cost
her
something
to
encounter
*NL*
Lady
Russell
's
surprise
;
and
now
,
if
she
were
by
any
chance
to
be
*NL*
thrown
into
company
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
her
imperfect
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
matter
might
add
another
shade
of
prejudice
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
morning
Anne
was
out
with
her
friend
,
and
for
the
first
*NL*
hour
,
in
an
incessant
and
fearful
sort
of
watch
for
him
in
vain
;
but
at
*NL*
last
,
in
returning
down
Pulteney
Street
,
she
distinguished
him
on
the
*NL*
right
hand
pavement
at
such
a
distance
as
to
have
him
in
view
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
the
street
.
There
were
many
other
men
about
him
,
many
*NL*
groups
walking
the
same
way
,
but
there
was
no
mistaking
him
.
She
*NL*
looked
instinctively
at
Lady
Russell
;
but
not
from
any
mad
idea
of
her
*NL*
recognising
him
so
soon
as
she
did
herself
.
No
,
it
was
not
to
be
*NL*
supposed
that
Lady
Russell
would
perceive
him
till
they
were
nearly
*NL*
opposite
.
She
looked
at
her
however
,
from
time
to
time
,
anxiously
;
and
*NL*
when
the
moment
approached
which
must
point
him
out
,
though
not
daring
*NL*
to
look
again
-LRB-
for
her
own
countenance
she
knew
was
unfit
to
be
seen
-RRB-
,
*NL*
she
was
yet
perfectly
conscious
of
Lady
Russell
's
eyes
being
turned
*NL*
exactly
in
the
direction
for
him
--
of
her
being
,
in
short
,
intently
*NL*
observing
him
.
She
could
thoroughly
comprehend
the
sort
of
fascination
*NL*
he
must
possess
over
Lady
Russell
's
mind
,
the
difficulty
it
must
be
for
*NL*
her
to
withdraw
her
eyes
,
the
astonishment
she
must
be
feeling
that
*NL*
eight
or
nine
years
should
have
passed
over
him
,
and
in
foreign
climes
*NL*
and
in
active
service
too
,
without
robbing
him
of
one
personal
grace
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
Lady
Russell
drew
back
her

``
Now
,
how
would
she
speak
of
*NL*
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
wonder
,
''
said
she
,
``
what
has
been
fixing
my
eye
so
long
;
but
*NL*
I
was
looking
after
some
window-curtains
,
which
Lady
Alicia
and
Mrs
*NL*
Frankland
were
telling
me
of
last
night
.
They
described
the
*NL*
drawing-room
window-curtains
of
one
of
the
houses
on
this
side
of
the
*NL*
way
,
and
this
part
of
the
street
,
as
being
the
handsomest
and
best
hung
*NL*
of
any
in
Bath
,
but
could
not
recollect
the
exact
number
,
and
I
have
*NL*
been
trying
to
find
out
which
it
could
be
;
but
I
confess
I
can
see
no
*NL*
curtains
hereabouts
that
answer
their
description
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
sighed
and
blushed
and
smiled
,
in
pity
and
disdain
,
either
at
her
*NL*
friend
or
herself
.
The
part
which
provoked
her
most
,
was
that
in
all
*NL*
this
waste
of
foresight
and
caution
,
she
should
have
lost
the
right
*NL*
moment
for
seeing
whether
he
saw
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
day
or
two
passed
without
producing
anything
.
The
theatre
or
the
*NL*
rooms
,
where
he
was
most
likely
to
be
,
were
not
fashionable
enough
for
*NL*
the
Elliots
,
whose
evening
amusements
were
solely
in
the
elegant
*NL*
stupidity
of
private
parties
,
in
which
they
were
getting
more
and
more
*NL*
engaged
;
and
Anne
,
wearied
of
such
a
state
of
stagnation
,
sick
of
*NL*
knowing
nothing
,
and
fancying
herself
stronger
because
her
strength
was
*NL*
not
tried
,
was
quite
impatient
for
the
concert
evening
.
It
was
a
*NL*
concert
for
the
benefit
of
a
person
patronised
by
Lady
Dalrymple
.
Of
*NL*
course
they
must
attend
.
It
was
really
expected
to
be
a
good
one
,
and
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
was
very
fond
of
music
.
If
she
could
only
have
a
few
*NL*
minutes
conversation
with
him
again
,
she
fancied
she
should
be
*NL*
satisfied
;
and
as
to
the
power
of
addressing
him
,
she
felt
all
over
*NL*
courage
if
the
opportunity
occurred
.
Elizabeth
had
turned
from
him
,
*NL*
Lady
Russell
overlooked
him
;
her
nerves
were
strengthened
by
these
*NL*
circumstances
;
she
felt
that
she
owed
him
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
once
partly
promised
Mrs
Smith
to
spend
the
evening
with
her
;
*NL*
but
in
a
short
hurried
call
she
excused
herself
and
put
it
off
,
with
*NL*
the
more
decided
promise
of
a
longer
visit
on
the
morrow
.
Mrs
Smith
*NL*
gave
a
most
good-humoured
acquiescence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
''
said
she
;
``
only
tell
me
all
about
it
,
when
you
do
come
.
*NL*
Who
is
your
party
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
named
them
all
.
Mrs
Smith
made
no
reply
;
but
when
she
was
leaving
*NL*
her
said
,
and
with
an
expression
half
serious
,
half
arch
,
``
Well
,
I
*NL*
heartily
wish
your
concert
may
answer
;
and
do
not
fail
me
to-morrow
if
*NL*
you
can
come
;
for
I
begin
to
have
a
foreboding
that
I
may
not
have
many
*NL*
more
visits
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
startled
and
confused
;
but
after
standing
in
a
moment
's
*NL*
suspense
,
was
obliged
,
and
not
sorry
to
be
obliged
,
to
hurry
away
.

Chapter
20
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
,
his
two
daughters
,
and
Mrs
Clay
,
were
the
earliest
of
all
*NL*
their
party
at
the
rooms
in
the
evening
;
and
as
Lady
Dalrymple
must
be
*NL*
waited
for
,
they
took
their
station
by
one
of
the
fires
in
the
Octagon
*NL*
Room
.
But
hardly
were
they
so
settled
,
when
the
door
opened
again
,
and
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
walked
in
alone
.
Anne
was
the
nearest
to
him
,
and
*NL*
making
yet
a
little
advance
,
she
instantly
spoke
.
He
was
preparing
*NL*
only
to
bow
and
pass
on
,
but
her
gentle
``
How
do
you
do
?
''
brought
him
*NL*
out
of
the
straight
line
to
stand
near
her
,
and
make
enquiries
in
*NL*
return
,
in
spite
of
the
formidable
father
and
sister
in
the
back
*NL*
ground
.
Their
being
in
the
back
ground
was
a
support
to
Anne
;
she
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
their
looks
,
and
felt
equal
to
everything
which
she
believed
*NL*
right
to
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
speaking
,
a
whispering
between
her
father
and
Elizabeth
*NL*
caught
her
ear
.
She
could
not
distinguish
,
but
she
must
guess
the
*NL*
subject
;
and
on
Captain
Wentworth
's
making
a
distant
bow
,
she
*NL*
comprehended
that
her
father
had
judged
so
well
as
to
give
him
that
*NL*
simple
acknowledgement
of
acquaintance
,
and
she
was
just
in
time
by
a
*NL*
side
glance
to
see
a
slight
curtsey
from
Elizabeth
herself
.
This
,
*NL*
though
late
,
and
reluctant
,
and
ungracious
,
was
yet
better
than
*NL*
nothing
,
and
her
spirits
improved
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
talking
,
however
,
of
the
weather
,
and
Bath
,
and
the
concert
,
*NL*
their
conversation
began
to
flag
,
and
so
little
was
said
at
last
,
that
*NL*
she
was
expecting
him
to
go
every
moment
,
but
he
did
not
;
he
seemed
in
*NL*
no
hurry
to
leave
her
;
and
presently
with
renewed
spirit
,
with
a
little
*NL*
smile
,
a
little
glow
,
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
hardly
seen
you
since
our
day
at
Lyme
.
I
am
afraid
you
must
*NL*
have
suffered
from
the
shock
,
and
the
more
from
its
not
overpowering
*NL*
you
at
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
assured
him
that
she
had
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
frightful
hour
,
''
said
he
,
``
a
frightful
day
!
''
and
he
passed
*NL*
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
as
if
the
remembrance
were
still
too
painful
,
*NL*
but
in
a
moment
,
half
smiling
again
,
added
,
``
The
day
has
produced
some
*NL*
effects
however
;
has
had
some
consequences
which
must
be
considered
as
*NL*
the
very
reverse
of
frightful
.
When
you
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
*NL*
suggest
that
Benwick
would
be
the
properest
person
to
fetch
a
surgeon
,
*NL*
you
could
have
little
idea
of
his
being
eventually
one
of
those
most
*NL*
concerned
in
her
recovery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
could
have
none
.
But
it
appears
--
I
should
hope
it
would
*NL*
be
a
very
happy
match
.
There
are
on
both
sides
good
principles
and
*NL*
good
temper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
,
looking
not
exactly
forward
;
``
but
there
,
I
think
,
ends
*NL*
the
resemblance
.
With
all
my
soul
I
wish
them
happy
,
and
rejoice
over
*NL*
every
circumstance
in
favour
of
it
.
They
have
no
difficulties
to
*NL*
contend
with
at
home
,
no
opposition
,
no
caprice
,
no
delays
.
The
*NL*
Musgroves
are
behaving
like
themselves
,
most
honourably
and
kindly
,
*NL*
only
anxious
with
true
parental
hearts
to
promote
their
daughter
's
*NL*
comfort
.
All
this
is
much
,
very
much
in
favour
of
their
happiness
;
*NL*
more
than
perhaps
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
.
A
sudden
recollection
seemed
to
occur
,
and
to
give
him
*NL*
some
taste
of
that
emotion
which
was
reddening
Anne
's
cheeks
and
fixing
*NL*
her
eyes
on
the
ground
.
After
clearing
his
throat
,
however
,
he
*NL*
proceeded
thus
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
that
I
do
think
there
is
a
disparity
,
too
great
a
disparity
,
*NL*
and
in
a
point
no
less
essential
than
mind
.
I
regard
Louisa
Musgrove
*NL*
as
a
very
amiable
,
sweet-tempered
girl
,
and
not
deficient
in
*NL*
understanding
,
but
Benwick
is
something
more
.
He
is
a
clever
man
,
a
*NL*
reading
man
;
and
I
confess
,
that
I
do
consider
his
attaching
himself
to
*NL*
her
with
some
surprise
.
Had
it
been
the
effect
of
gratitude
,
had
he
*NL*
learnt
to
love
her
,
because
he
believed
her
to
be
preferring
him
,
it
*NL*
would
have
been
another
thing
.
But
I
have
no
reason
to
suppose
it
so
.
*NL*
It
seems
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
have
been
a
perfectly
spontaneous
,
*NL*
untaught
feeling
on
his
side
,
and
this
surprises
me
.
A
man
like
him
,
*NL*
in
his
situation
!
with
a
heart
pierced
,
wounded
,
almost
broken
!
Fanny
*NL*
Harville
was
a
very
superior
creature
,
and
his
attachment
to
her
was
*NL*
indeed
attachment
.
A
man
does
not
recover
from
such
a
devotion
of
the
*NL*
heart
to
such
a
woman
.
He
ought
not
;
he
does
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Either
from
the
consciousness
,
however
,
that
his
friend
had
recovered
,
*NL*
or
from
other
consciousness
,
he
went
no
farther
;
and
Anne
who
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
agitated
voice
in
which
the
latter
part
had
been
uttered
,
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
the
various
noises
of
the
room
,
the
almost
ceaseless
slam
*NL*
of
the
door
,
and
ceaseless
buzz
of
persons
walking
through
,
had
*NL*
distinguished
every
word
,
was
struck
,
gratified
,
confused
,
and
*NL*
beginning
to
breathe
very
quick
,
and
feel
an
hundred
things
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
It
was
impossible
for
her
to
enter
on
such
a
subject
;
and
yet
,
*NL*
after
a
pause
,
feeling
the
necessity
of
speaking
,
and
having
not
the
*NL*
smallest
wish
for
a
total
change
,
she
only
deviated
so
far
as
to
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
a
good
while
at
Lyme
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
a
fortnight
.
I
could
not
leave
it
till
Louisa
's
doing
well
was
*NL*
quite
ascertained
.
I
had
been
too
deeply
concerned
in
the
mischief
to
*NL*
be
soon
at
peace
.
It
had
been
my
doing
,
solely
mine
.
She
would
not
*NL*
have
been
obstinate
if
I
had
not
been
weak
.
The
country
round
Lyme
is
*NL*
very
fine
.
I
walked
and
rode
a
great
deal
;
and
the
more
I
saw
,
the
*NL*
more
I
found
to
admire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
very
much
like
to
see
Lyme
again
,
''
said
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
I
should
not
have
supposed
that
you
could
have
found
anything
*NL*
in
Lyme
to
inspire
such
a
feeling
.
The
horror
and
distress
you
were
*NL*
involved
in
,
the
stretch
of
mind
,
the
wear
of
spirits
!
I
should
have
*NL*
thought
your
last
impressions
of
Lyme
must
have
been
strong
disgust
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
hours
were
certainly
very
painful
,
''
replied
Anne
;
``
but
when
*NL*
pain
is
over
,
the
remembrance
of
it
often
becomes
a
pleasure
.
One
does
*NL*
not
love
a
place
the
less
for
having
suffered
in
it
,
unless
it
has
been
*NL*
all
suffering
,
nothing
but
suffering
,
which
was
by
no
means
the
case
at
*NL*
Lyme
.
We
were
only
in
anxiety
and
distress
during
the
last
two
hours
,
*NL*
and
previously
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
enjoyment
.
So
much
*NL*
novelty
and
beauty
!
I
have
travelled
so
little
,
that
every
fresh
place
*NL*
would
be
interesting
to
me
;
but
there
is
real
beauty
at
Lyme
;
and
in
*NL*
short
''
-LRB-
with
a
faint
blush
at
some
recollections
-RRB-
,
``
altogether
my
*NL*
impressions
of
the
place
are
very
agreeable

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
ceased
,
the
entrance
door
opened
again
,
and
the
very
party
*NL*
appeared
for
whom
they
were
waiting
.
``
Lady
Dalrymple
,
Lady
Dalrymple
,
''
*NL*
was
the
rejoicing
sound
;
and
with
all
the
eagerness
compatible
with
*NL*
anxious
elegance
,
Sir
Walter
and
his
two
ladies
stepped
forward
to
meet
*NL*
her
.
Lady
Dalrymple
and
Miss
Carteret
,
escorted
by
Mr
Elliot
and
*NL*
Colonel
Wallis
,
who
had
happened
to
arrive
nearly
at
the
same
instant
,
*NL*
advanced
into
the
room
.
The
others
joined
them
,
and
it
was
a
group
in
*NL*
which
Anne
found
herself
also
necessarily
included
.
She
was
divided
*NL*
from
Captain
Wentworth
.
Their
interesting
,
almost
too
interesting
*NL*
conversation
must
be
broken
up
for
a
time
,
but
slight
was
the
penance
*NL*
compared
with
the
happiness
which
brought
it
on
!
She
had
learnt
,
in
*NL*
the
last
ten
minutes
,
more
of
his
feelings
towards
Louisa
,
more
of
all
*NL*
his
feelings
than
she
dared
to
think
of
;
and
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
*NL*
demands
of
the
party
,
to
the
needful
civilities
of
the
moment
,
with
*NL*
exquisite
,
though
agitated
sensations
.
She
was
in
good
humour
with
*NL*
all
.
She
had
received
ideas
which
disposed
her
to
be
courteous
and
*NL*
kind
to
all
,
and
to
pity
every
one
,
as
being
less
happy
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
delightful
emotions
were
a
little
subdued
,
when
on
stepping
back
*NL*
from
the
group
,
to
be
joined
again
by
Captain
Wentworth
,
she
saw
that
*NL*
he
was
gone
.
She
was
just
in
time
to
see
him
turn
into
the
Concert
*NL*
Room
.
He
was
gone
;
he
had
disappeared
,
she
felt
a
moment
's
regret
.
*NL*
But
``
they
should
meet
again
.
He
would
look
for
her
,
he
would
find
her
*NL*
out
before
the
evening
were
over
,
and
at
present
,
perhaps
,
it
was
as
*NL*
well
to
be
asunder
.
She
was
in
need
of
a
little
interval
for
*NL*
recollection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
Lady
Russell
's
appearance
soon
afterwards
,
the
whole
party
was
*NL*
collected
,
and
all
that
remained
was
to
marshal
themselves
,
and
proceed
*NL*
into
the
Concert
Room
;
and
be
of
all
the
consequence
in
their
power
,
*NL*
draw
as
many
eyes
,
excite
as
many
whispers
,
and
disturb
as
many
people
*NL*
as
they
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
,
very
happy
were
both
Elizabeth
and
Anne
Elliot
as
they
walked
in
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
arm
in
arm
with
Miss
Carteret
,
and
looking
on
the
broad
back
*NL*
of
the
dowager
Viscountess
Dalrymple
before
her
,
had
nothing
to
wish
*NL*
for
which
did
not
seem
within
her
reach
;
and
Anne
--
but
it
would
be
an
*NL*
insult
to
the
nature
of
Anne
's
felicity
,
to
draw
any
comparison
between
*NL*
it
and
her
sister
's
;
the
origin
of
one
all
selfish
vanity
,
of
the
other
*NL*
all
generous
attachment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
saw
nothing
,
thought
nothing
of
the
brilliancy
of
the
room
.
Her
*NL*
happiness
was
from
within
.
Her
eyes
were
bright
and
her
cheeks
glowed
;
*NL*
but
she
knew
nothing
about
it
.
She
was
thinking
only
of
the
last
half
*NL*
hour
,
and
as
they
passed
to
their
seats
,
her
mind
took
a
hasty
range
*NL*
over
it
.
His
choice
of
subjects
,
his
expressions
,
and
still
more
his
*NL*
manner
and
look
,
had
been
such
as
she
could
see
in
only
one
light
.
His
*NL*
opinion
of
Louisa
Musgrove
's
inferiority
,
an
opinion
which
he
had
*NL*
seemed
solicitous
to
give
,
his
wonder
at
Captain
Benwick
,
his
feelings
*NL*
as
to
a
first
,
strong
attachment
;
sentences
begun
which
he
could
not
*NL*
finish
,
his
half
averted
eyes
and
more
than
half
expressive
glance
,
*NL*
all
,
all
declared
that
he
had
a
heart
returning
to
her
at
least
;
that
*NL*
anger
,
resentment
,
avoidance
,
were
no
more
;
and
that
they
were
*NL*
succeeded
,
not
merely
by
friendship
and
regard
,
but
by
the
tenderness
*NL*
of
the
past
.
Yes
,
some
share
of
the
tenderness
of
the
past
.
She
could
*NL*
not
contemplate
the
change
as
implying
less
.
He
must
love
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
thoughts
,
with
their
attendant
visions
,
which
occupied
and
*NL*
flurried
her
too
much
to
leave
her
any
power
of
observation
;
and
she
*NL*
passed
along
the
room
without
having
a
glimpse
of
him
,
without
even
*NL*
trying
to
discern
him
.
When
their
places
were
determined
on
,
and
they
*NL*
were
all
properly
arranged
,
she
looked
round
to
see
if
he
should
happen
*NL*
to
be
in
the
same
part
of
the
room
,
but
he
was
not
;
her
eye
could
not
*NL*
reach
him
;
and
the
concert
being
just
opening
,
she
must
consent
for
a
*NL*
time
to
be
happy
in
a
humbler
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
was
divided
and
disposed
of
on
two
contiguous
benches
:
Anne
*NL*
was
among
those
on
the
foremost
,
and
Mr
Elliot
had
manoeuvred
so
well
,
*NL*
with
the
assistance
of
his
friend
Colonel
Wallis
,
as
to
have
a
seat
by
*NL*
her
.
Miss
Elliot
,
surrounded
by
her
cousins
,
and
the
principal
object
*NL*
of
Colonel
Wallis
's
gallantry
,
was
quite
contented
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
mind
was
in
a
most
favourable
state
for
the
entertainment
of
the
*NL*
evening
;
it
was
just
occupation
enough
:
she
had
feelings
for
the
*NL*
tender
,
spirits
for
the
gay
,
attention
for
the
scientific
,
and
patience
*NL*
for
the
wearisome
;
and
had
never
liked
a
concert
better
,
at
least
*NL*
during
the
first
act
.
Towards
the
close
of
it
,
in
the
interval
*NL*
succeeding
an
Italian
song
,
she
explained
the
words
of
the
song
to
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
.
They
had
a
concert
bill
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
she
,
``
is
nearly
the
sense
,
or
rather
the
meaning
of
the
*NL*
words
,
for
certainly
the
sense
of
an
Italian
love-song
must
not
be
*NL*
talked
of
,
but
it
is
as
nearly
the
meaning
as
I
can
give
;
for
I
do
not
*NL*
pretend
to
understand
the
language
.
I
am
a
very
poor
Italian
scholar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
see
you
are
.
I
see
you
know
nothing
of
the
matter

You
*NL*
have
only
knowledge
enough
of
the
language
to
translate
at
sight
these
*NL*
inverted
,
transposed
,
curtailed
Italian
lines
,
into
clear
,
*NL*
comprehensible
,
elegant
English
.
You
need
not
say
anything
more
of
*NL*
your
ignorance
.
Here
is
complete
proof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
oppose
such
kind
politeness
;
but
I
should
be
sorry
to
be
*NL*
examined
by
a
real
proficient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
visiting
in
Camden
Place
so
long
,
''
*NL*
replied
he
,
``
without
knowing
something
of
Miss
Anne
Elliot
;

I
do
*NL*
regard
her
as
one
who
is
too
modest
for
the
world
in
general
to
be
*NL*
aware
of
half
her
accomplishments
,
and
too
highly
accomplished
for
*NL*
modesty
to
be
natural
in
any
other
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
shame
!
for
shame
!
this
is
too
much
flattery
.
I
forget
what
we
are
*NL*
to
have
next
,
''
turning
to
the
bill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Mr
Elliot
,
speaking
low
,
``
I
have
had
a
longer
*NL*
acquaintance
with
your
character
than
you
are
aware
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
How
so
?
You
can
have
been
acquainted
with
it
only
since
I
*NL*
came
to
Bath

excepting
as
you
might
hear
me
previously
spoken
of
in
my
*NL*
own
family

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
by

long
before

I
have
been
acquainted

with
you
by

many
years
.
Your
person
,
your
disposition
,
*NL*
accomplishments
,
manner
;
they
were
all
present
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
was
not
disappointed
in
the
interest
he
hoped
to
raise
.
No
*NL*
one
can
withstand
the
charm
of
such
a
mystery
.
To
have
been
described
*NL*
long
ago
to
a
recent
acquaintance
,
by
nameless
people
,
is
irresistible
;
*NL*
and
Anne
was
all
curiosity
.
She
wondered
,
and
questioned
him
eagerly
;
*NL*
but
in
vain
.
He
delighted
in
being
asked
,
but
he
would
not
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
some
time
or
other
,
perhaps
,
but
not
now
.
He
would
mention
no
*NL*
names
now
;
but
such
,
he
could
assure
her
,
had
been
the
fact
.
He
had
*NL*
many
years
ago
received
such
a
description
of
Miss
Anne
Elliot
as
had
*NL*
inspired
him
with
the
highest
idea
of
her
merit
,
and
excited
the
*NL*
warmest
curiosity
to
know
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
could
think
of
no
one
so
likely
to
have
spoken
with
partiality
of
*NL*
her
many
years
ago
as
the
Mr
Wentworth
of
Monkford
,
Captain
Wentworth
's
*NL*
brother
.
He
might
have
been
in
Mr
Elliot
's
company
,
but
she
had
not
*NL*
courage
to
ask
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
name
of
Anne
Elliot
,
''
said
he
,
``
has
long
had
an
interesting
sound
*NL*
to
me
.
Very
long
has
it
possessed
a
charm
over
my
fancy
;
and
,
if
I
*NL*
dared
,
I
would
breathe
my
wishes
that
the
name
might
never
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
,
she
believed
,
were
his
words
;
but
scarcely
had
she
received
their
*NL*
sound
,
than
her
attention
was
caught
by
other
sounds
immediately
behind
*NL*
her
,
which
rendered
every
thing
else
trivial
.
Her
father
and
Lady
*NL*
Dalrymple
were
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
well-looking
man
,
''
said
Sir
Walter
,
``
a
very
well-looking
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
fine
young
man
indeed
!
''
said
Lady
Dalrymple
.
``
More
air
than
*NL*
one
often
sees
in
Bath
.
Irish
,
I
dare
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
just
know
his
name
.
A
bowing
acquaintance
.
Wentworth
;
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
of
the
navy
.
His
sister
married
my
tenant
in
Somersetshire
,
*NL*
the
Croft
,
who
rents
Kellynch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Sir
Walter
had
reached
this
point
,
Anne
's
eyes
had
caught
the
*NL*
right
direction
,
and
distinguished
Captain
Wentworth
standing
among
a
*NL*
cluster
of
men
at
a
little
distance
.
As
her
eyes
fell
on
him
,
his
*NL*
seemed
to
be
withdrawn
from
her
.
It
had
that
appearance
.
It
seemed
as
*NL*
if
she
had
been
one
moment
too
late
;
and
as
long
as
she
dared
observe
,
*NL*
he
did
not
look
again
:
but
the
performance
was
recommencing
,
and
she
*NL*
was
forced
to
seem
to
restore
her
attention
to
the
orchestra
and
look
*NL*
straight
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
could
give
another
glance
,
he
had
moved
away
.
He
could
not
*NL*
have
come
nearer
to
her
if
he
would
;
she
was
so
surrounded
and
shut
in
:
*NL*
but
she
would
rather
have
caught
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
's
speech
,
too
,
distressed
her
.
She
had
no
longer
any
*NL*
inclination
to
talk
to
him
.
She
wished
him
not
so
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
act
was
over
.
Now
she
hoped
for
some
beneficial
change
;
and
,
*NL*
after
a
period
of
nothing-saying
amongst
the
party
,
some
of
them
did
*NL*
decide
on
going
in
quest
of
tea
.
Anne
was
one
of
the
few
who
did
not
*NL*
choose
to
move
.
She
remained
in
her
seat
,
and
so
did
Lady
Russell
;
but
*NL*
she
had
the
pleasure
of
getting
rid
of
Mr
Elliot
;
and
she
did
not
mean
,
*NL*
whatever
she
might
feel
on
Lady
Russell
's
account
,
to
shrink
from
*NL*
conversation
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
if
he
gave
her
the
opportunity
.
*NL*
She
was
persuaded
by
Lady
Russell
's
countenance
that
she
had
seen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
come
however
.
Anne
sometimes
fancied
she
discerned
him
at
a
*NL*
distance
,
but
he
never
came
.
The
anxious
interval
wore
away
*NL*
unproductively
.
The
others
returned
,
the
room
filled
again
,
benches
*NL*
were
reclaimed
and
repossessed
,
and
another
hour
of
pleasure
or
of
*NL*
penance
was
to
be
sat
out
,
another
hour
of
music
was
to
give
delight
or
*NL*
the
gapes
,
as
real
or
affected
taste
for
it
prevailed
.
To
Anne
,
it
*NL*
chiefly
wore
the
prospect
of
an
hour
of
agitation
.
She
could
not
quit
*NL*
that
room
in
peace
without
seeing
Captain
Wentworth
once
more
,
without
*NL*
the
interchange
of
one
friendly
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
re-settling
themselves
there
were
now
many
changes
,
the
result
of
*NL*
which
was
favourable
for
her
.
Colonel
Wallis
declined
sitting
down
*NL*
again
,
and
Mr
Elliot
was
invited
by
Elizabeth
and
Miss
Carteret
,
in
a
*NL*
manner
not
to
be
refused
,
to
sit
between
them
;
and
by
some
other
*NL*
removals
,
and
a
little
scheming
of
her
own
,
Anne
was
enabled
to
place
*NL*
herself
much
nearer
the
end
of
the
bench
than
she
had
been
before
,
much
*NL*
more
within
reach
of
a
passer-by
.
She
could
not
do
so
,
without
*NL*
comparing
herself
with
Miss
Larolles
,
the
inimitable
Miss
Larolles
;
but
*NL*
still
she
did
it
,
and
not
with
much
happier
effect
;
though
by
what
*NL*
seemed
prosperity
in
the
shape
of
an
early
abdication
in
her
next
*NL*
neighbours
,
she
found
herself
at
the
very
end
of
the
bench
before
the
*NL*
concert
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
her
situation
,
with
a
vacant
space
at
hand
,
when
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
was
again
in
sight
.
She
saw
him
not
far
off
.
He
saw
her
*NL*
too
;
yet
he
looked
grave
,
and
seemed
irresolute
,
and
only
by
very
slow
*NL*
degrees
came
at
last
near
enough
to
speak
to
her
.
She
felt
that
*NL*
something
must
be
the
matter
.
The
change
was
indubitable
.
The
*NL*
difference
between
his
present
air
and
what
it
had
been
in
the
Octagon
*NL*
Room
was
strikingly
great
.
Why
was
it
?
She
thought
of
her
father
,
of
*NL*
Lady
Russell
.
Could
there
have
been
any
unpleasant
glances
?
He
began
*NL*
by
speaking
of
the
concert
gravely
,
more
like
the
Captain
Wentworth
of
*NL*
Uppercross
;
owned
himself
disappointed
,
had
expected
singing
;
and
in
*NL*
short
,
must
confess
that
he
should
not
be
sorry
when
it
was
over
.
Anne
*NL*
replied
,
and
spoke
in
defence
of
the
performance
so
well
,
and
yet
in
*NL*
allowance
for
his
feelings
so
pleasantly
,
that
his
countenance
*NL*
improved
,
and
he
replied
again
with
almost
a
smile
.
They
talked
for
a
*NL*
few
minutes
more
;
the
improvement
held
;
he
even
looked
down
towards
the
*NL*
bench
,
as
if
he
saw
a
place
on
it
well
worth
occupying
;
when
at
that
*NL*
moment
a
touch
on
her
shoulder
obliged
Anne
to
turn
round
.
It
came
*NL*
from
Mr
Elliot
.
He
begged
her
pardon
,
but
she
must
be
applied
to
,
to
*NL*
explain
Italian
again
.
Miss
Carteret
was
very
anxious
to
have
a
*NL*
general
idea
of
what
was
next
to
be
sung
.
Anne
could
not
refuse
;
but
*NL*
never
had
she
sacrificed
to
politeness
with
a
more
suffering
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
,
though
as
few
as
possible
,
were
inevitably
consumed
;
and
*NL*
when
her
own
mistress
again
,
when
able
to
turn
and
look
as
she
had
done
*NL*
before
,
she
found
herself
accosted
by
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
a
reserved
*NL*
yet
hurried
sort
of
farewell
.
``
He
must
wish
her
good
night
;
he
was
*NL*
going
;
he
should
get
home
as
fast
as
he
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
this
song
worth
staying
for
?
''
said
Anne
,
suddenly
struck
by
an
*NL*
idea
which
made
her
yet
more
anxious
to
be
encouraging
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
he
replied
impressively
,
``
there
is
nothing
worth
my
staying
for
;
''
*NL*
and
he
was
gone
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jealousy
of
Mr
Elliot
!
It
was
the
only
intelligible
motive
.
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
jealous
of
her
affection
!
Could
she
have
believed
it
a
week
*NL*
ago
;
three
hours
ago
!
For
a
moment
the
gratification
was
exquisite
.
*NL*
But
,
alas
!
there
were
very
different
thoughts
to
succeed
.
How
was
such
*NL*
jealousy
to
be
quieted
?
How
was
the
truth
to
reach
him
?
How
,
in
all
*NL*
the
peculiar
disadvantages
of
their
respective
situations
,
would
he
*NL*
ever
learn
of
her
real
sentiments
?
It
was
misery
to
think
of
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
's
attentions
.
Their
evil
was
incalculable
.

Chapter
21
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
recollected
with
pleasure
the
next
morning
her
promise
of
going
to
*NL*
Mrs
Smith
,
meaning
that
it
should
engage
her
from
home
at
the
time
when
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
would
be
most
likely
to
call
;
for
to
avoid
Mr
Elliot
was
*NL*
almost
a
first
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
a
great
deal
of
good-will
towards
him
.
In
spite
of
the
*NL*
mischief
of
his
attentions
,
she
owed
him
gratitude
and
regard
,
perhaps
*NL*
compassion
.
She
could
not
help
thinking
much
of
the
extraordinary
*NL*
circumstances
attending
their
acquaintance
,
of
the
right
which
he
*NL*
seemed
to
have
to
interest
her
,
by
everything
in
situation
,
by
his
own
*NL*
sentiments
,
by
his
early
prepossession
.
It
was
altogether
very
*NL*
extraordinary
;
flattering
,
but
painful
.
There
was
much
to
regret
.
How
*NL*
she
might
have
felt
had
there
been
no
Captain
Wentworth
in
the
case
,
*NL*
was
not
worth
enquiry
;
for
there
was
a
Captain
Wentworth
;
and
be
the
*NL*
conclusion
of
the
present
suspense
good
or
bad
,
her
affection
would
be
*NL*
his
for
ever
.
Their
union
,
she
believed
,
could
not
divide
her
more
*NL*
from
other
men
,
than
their
final
separation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prettier
musings
of
high-wrought
love
and
eternal
constancy
,
could
*NL*
never
have
passed
along
the
streets
of
Bath
,
than
Anne
was
sporting
*NL*
with
from
Camden
Place
to
Westgate
Buildings
.
It
was
almost
enough
to
*NL*
spread
purification
and
perfume
all
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sure
of
a
pleasant
reception
;
and
her
friend
seemed
this
*NL*
morning
particularly
obliged
to
her
for
coming
,
seemed
hardly
to
have
*NL*
expected
her
,
though
it
had
been
an
appointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
account
of
the
concert
was
immediately
claimed
;
and
Anne
's
*NL*
recollections
of
the
concert
were
quite
happy
enough
to
animate
her
*NL*
features
and
make
her
rejoice
to
talk
of
it
.
All
that
she
could
tell
*NL*
she
told
most
gladly
,
but
the
all
was
little
for
one
who
had
been
*NL*
there
,
and
unsatisfactory
for
such
an
enquirer
as
Mrs
Smith
,
who
had
*NL*
already
heard
,
through
the
short
cut
of
a
laundress
and
a
waiter
,
*NL*
rather
more
of
the
general
success
and
produce
of
the
evening
than
Anne
*NL*
could
relate
,
and
who
now
asked
in
vain
for
several
particulars
of
the
*NL*
company
.
Everybody
of
any
consequence
or
notoriety
in
Bath
was
well
*NL*
know
by
name
to
Mrs
Smith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
Durands
were
there
,
I
conclude
,
''
said
she
,
``
with
their
*NL*
mouths
open
to
catch
the
music
,
like
unfledged
sparrows
ready
to
be
*NL*
fed
.
They
never
miss
a
concert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
did
not
see
them
myself
,
but
I
heard
Mr
Elliot
say
they
were
in
*NL*
the
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Ibbotsons
,
were
they
there
?
and
the
two
new
beauties
,
with
the
*NL*
tall
Irish
officer

who
is
talked
of
for
one
of
them
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know

I
do
not
think
they
were

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
Lady
Mary
Maclean
?
I
need
not
ask
after
her
.
She
never
misses
,
I
*NL*
know
;
and
you
must
have
seen
her
.
She
must
have
been
in
your
own
*NL*
circle
;
for
as
you
went
with
Lady
Dalrymple
,
you
were
in
the
seats
of
*NL*
grandeur
,
round
the
orchestra
,
of
course
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
was
what
I
dreaded
.
It
would
have
been
very
unpleasant
to
me
*NL*
in
every
respect
.
But
happily
Lady
Dalrymple
always
chooses
to
be
*NL*
farther
off
;
and
we
were
exceedingly
well
placed
,
that
is
,
for
hearing
;
*NL*
I
must
not
say
for
seeing
,
because
I
appear
to
have
seen
very
little

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
you
saw
enough
for
your
own
amusement

I
can
understand
.
There
*NL*
is
a
sort
of
domestic
enjoyment
to
be
known
even
in
a
crowd
,
and
this
*NL*
you
had
.
You
were
a
large
party
in
yourselves
,
and
you
wanted
nothing
*NL*
beyond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ought
to
have
looked
about
me
more
,
''
said
Anne
,
conscious
while
*NL*
she
spoke
that
there
had
in
fact
been
no
want
of
looking
about
,
that
*NL*
the
object
only
had
been
deficient
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
you
were
better
employed
.
You
need
not
tell
me
that
you
had
a
*NL*
pleasant
evening
.
I
see
it
in
your
eye
.
I
perfectly
see
how
the
hours
*NL*
passed
:
that
you
had
always
something
agreeable
to
listen
to
.
In
the
*NL*
intervals
of
the
concert
it
was
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
half
smiled
and
said
,
``
Do
you
see
that
in
my
eye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
.
Your
countenance
perfectly
informs
me
that
you
were
in
*NL*
company
last
night
with
the
person
whom
you
think
the
most
agreeable
in
*NL*
the
world
,
the
person
who
interests
you
at
this
present
time
more
than
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
the
world
put
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
blush
overspread
Anne
's
cheeks
.
She
could
say
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
such
being
the
case
,
''
continued
Mrs
Smith
,
after
a
short
pause
,
``
I
*NL*
hope
you
believe
that
I
do
know
how
to
value
your
kindness
in
coming
to
*NL*
me
this
morning
.
It
is
really
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
sit
with
*NL*
me
,
when
you
must
have
so
many
pleasanter
demands
upon
your
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
heard
nothing
of
this
.
She
was
still
in
the
astonishment
and
*NL*
confusion
excited
by
her
friend
's
penetration
,
unable
to
imagine
how
*NL*
any
report
of
Captain
Wentworth
could
have
reached
her
.
After
another
*NL*
short
silence
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
''
said
Mrs
Smith
,
``
is
Mr
Elliot
aware
of
your
acquaintance
with
*NL*
me
?
Does
he
know
that
I
am
in
Bath

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Elliot
!
''
repeated
Anne
,
looking
up
surprised
.
A
moment
's
*NL*
reflection
shewed
her
the
mistake
she
had
been
under
.
She
caught
it
*NL*
instantaneously
;
and
recovering
her
courage
with
the
feeling
of
safety
,
*NL*
soon
added
,
more
composedly
,
``
Are
you
acquainted
with
Mr
Elliot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
a
good
deal
acquainted
with
him

replied
Mrs
Smith
,
*NL*
gravely
,
``
but
it
seems
worn
out
now
.
It
is
a
great
while
since
we
met
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
at
all
aware

You
never
mentioned
it
before

Had
I

known

I
would
have
had
the
pleasure
of
talking
to
him
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
confess
the
truth

said
Mrs
Smith
,
assuming
her
usual
air
of
*NL*
cheerfulness
,
``
that
is
exactly
the
pleasure
I
want
you
to
have

I
want
*NL*
you
to
talk
about

to
Mr
Elliot
.
I
want
your
interest
with
him

He
*NL*
can
be
of
essential
service
to
me
;
and
if
you
would
have
the
goodness
,
*NL*
my
dear
Miss
Elliot
,
to
make
it
an
object
to
yourself
,
of
course
it
is
*NL*
done

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
extremely
happy

I
hope
you
can
not
doubt
my
willingness
to
*NL*
be
of
even
the
slightest
use
to
you

''
replied
Anne
;
``
but
I
suspect
that
*NL*
you
are
considering
me
as
having
a
higher
claim
on
Mr
Elliot

a
greater

right
to
influence
him

than
is
really
the
case

I
am
sure
you
have
,
*NL*
somehow
or
other
,
imbibed
such
a
notion

You
must
consider
me
only
as
*NL*
Mr

's
relation
.
If
in
that
light
there
is
anything
which
you
*NL*
suppose
his
cousin
might
fairly
ask
of
him

I
beg
you
would
not

hesitate
to
employ
me

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Smith
gave
her
a
penetrating
glance
,
and
then
,
smiling
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
a
little
premature

I
perceive

I
beg
your
pardon

for
official
information

But
now

Elliot

as
an
old
friend
,
do
give
me
a
hint
as
to
when
I
may
speak

*NL*
Next
week
?
To
be
sure
by
next
week
I
may
be
allowed
to
think
it
all
*NL*
settled

build
my

selfish
schemes
on
Mr

good
fortune

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

replied
Anne
,
``

be

I
am
not
going

marry
Mr

I
should
like
to
know
why
you

imagine

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Smith
looked
at
her
again
,
looked
earnestly
,
smiled
,
shook
her
*NL*
head
,
and
exclaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
how
I
do
wish
I
understood
you
!
How
I
do
wish
I
knew
what
you
*NL*
were
at
!
I
have
a
great
idea
that
you
do
not
design
to
be
cruel
,
when
*NL*
the
right
moment
occurs
.
Till
it
does
come
,
you
know
,
we
women
never
*NL*
mean
to
have
anybody
.
It
is
a
thing
of
course
among
us
,
that
every
man
*NL*
is
refused
,
till
he
offers
.
But
why
should
you
be
cruel
?
Let
me
plead
*NL*
for
my
--
present
friend
I
can
not
call
him
,
but
for
my
former
friend

*NL*
Where
can
you
look
for
a
more
suitable
match
?
Where
could
you
expect
a
*NL*
more
gentlemanlike
,
agreeable
man
?
Let
me
recommend
Mr
Elliot

I
am
*NL*
sure
you
hear
nothing
but
good
of
him
from
Colonel
Wallis

who
can

know
him
better
than
Colonel
Wallis

*NL*
``
My
dear
Mrs
Smith

Mr
Elliot

wife
has
not
been
dead
much
above
half
*NL*
a

He
ought
not

be
supposed
to
be
paying
his
addresses
to
any
*NL*
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
if
these
are
your

objections

cried
Mrs
Smith
,
archly
,
``
Mr

Elliot
is
safe

I
shall
give
myself
no
more
trouble
about
him

Do
*NL*
not
forget
me
when
you
are
married
,
that
's
all
.
Let
him
know
me
to
be
*NL*
a
friend
of
yours
,
and
then
he
will
think
little
of
the
trouble
*NL*
required
,
which
it
is
very
natural
for
him
now
,
with
so
many
affairs
*NL*

engagements
of
his
own
,
to
avoid
and
get
rid
of
as
he
can
;
very
*NL*
natural
,
perhaps

Ninety-nine
out
of
a
hundred
would
do
the

Of
*NL*
course

he
can
not

importance

Well

I
hope

trust
you

be
very

such
a

Your
peace
will
not
be

shipwrecked

mine
has
been

are
safe
in
all
worldly
matters

*NL*
safe
in
his
character

astray

misled
by
others
to
his
ruin

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Anne
,
``
I
can
readily
believe
all

seems
to
have
a
calm

at
all
open
to
dangerous
*NL*
impressions

I
consider
him
with
great
respect

I
have
no
reason

*NL*
from
any

fallen
within
my
observation

convince
you

Surely
this
must
be
calm

enough

upon
my

he

the

*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
,
regretting
with
a
deep
blush
that
she
had
implied
so
much
;
*NL*

less
would
hardly
have
been
sufficient
.
Mrs
Smith
would
hardly
*NL*
have
believed
so
soon
in
Mr
Elliot
's
failure
,
but
from
the
perception
*NL*
of
there
being
a
somebody
else

As
it
was

she
instantly
submitted

with
all
the
semblance

seeing
nothing
beyond

Anne
,
eager

escape
farther
notice

was
impatient

fancied

Mrs

on
Sunday
;
and
she
it
was
*NL*
who
told
me
you
were
to
marry
Mr
Elliot

She
had
had
it
from
Mrs
*NL*
Wallis
herself
,
which
did
not
seem
bad
authority
.
She
sat
an
hour
with
*NL*
me
on
Monday
evening
,
and
gave
me
the
whole
history

``
The
whole
*NL*
history

''
repeated
Anne
,
laughing
.
``
She
could
not
make
a
very
long
*NL*
history

I
think
,
of
one
such
little
article
of
unfounded
news

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Smith
said
nothing

``
But

continued
Anne
,
presently
,
``

there
is
no

in
my

having
this

on
Mr

I
should
be
extremely
happy
to
be
of
*NL*
use
to
you
in
any

that
I

Shall
I
mention
to
him
your
being

I
take
any

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
thank

no

certainly
not

In
the
warmth
of
the
moment

under
a
mistaken
impression
,
I
might
,
perhaps
,
have
endeavoured
to
*NL*
interest
you
in
some
circumstances

but
not
now

No

I
thank
you

*NL*
have
nothing
to
trouble
you

*NL*
*NL*

I

having
known
Mr

many
years

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
before

*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
Then
do
tell
me
what
he
was
at
that
time
of
life
.
I
have
a
*NL*
great
curiosity
to
know
what
Mr
Elliot
was
as
a
very
young
man
.
Was
he
*NL*
at
all
such
as
he
appears
now
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
seen
Mr
Elliot
these
three
years

was
Mrs
Smith
's
answer
,
*NL*
given
so
gravely
that
it
was
impossible
to
pursue
the
subject
farther
;
*NL*
and
Anne
felt
that
she
had
gained
nothing
but
an
increase
of
curiosity
.
*NL*
They
were
both
silent
:
Mrs
Smith
very
thoughtful
.
At
last
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
my
dear
Miss
Elliot
,
''
she
cried
,
in
her
natural
*NL*
tone
of
cordiality
,
``
I
beg
your
pardon
for
the
short
answers
I
have
*NL*
been
giving
you
,
but
I
have
been
uncertain
what
I
ought
to
do
.
I
have
*NL*
been
doubting
and
considering
as
to
what
I
ought
to
tell
you
.
There
*NL*
were
many
things
to
be
taken
into
the
account
.
One
hates
to
be
*NL*
officious
,
to
be
giving
bad
impressions
,
making
mischief
.
Even
the
*NL*
smooth
surface
of
family-union
seems
worth
preserving
,
though
there
may
*NL*
be
nothing
durable
beneath
.
However
,
I
have
determined
;
I
think
I
am
*NL*
right
;
I
think
you
ought
to
be
made
acquainted
with
Mr
Elliot
's
real
*NL*
character
.
Though
I
fully
believe
that
,
at
present
,
you
have
not
the
*NL*
smallest
intention
of
accepting
him
,
there
is
no
saying
what
may
*NL*
happen
.
You
might
,
some
time
or
other
,
be
differently
affected
towards
*NL*
him
.
Hear
the
truth
,
therefore
,
now
,
while
you
are
unprejudiced
.
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
is
a
man
without
heart
or
conscience
;
a
designing
,
wary
,
*NL*
cold-blooded
being
,
who
thinks
only
of
himself
;
whom
for
his
own
*NL*
interest
or
ease
,
would
be
guilty
of
any
cruelty
,
or
any
treachery
,
*NL*
that
could
be
perpetrated
without
risk
of
his
general
character
.
He
*NL*
has
no
feeling
for
others
.
Those
whom
he
has
been
the
chief
cause
of
*NL*
leading
into
ruin
,
he
can
neglect
and
desert
without
the
smallest
*NL*
compunction
.
He
is
totally
beyond
the
reach
of
any
sentiment
of
*NL*
justice
or
compassion
.
Oh
!
he
is
black
at
heart
,
hollow
and
black
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
astonished
air
,
and
exclamation
of
wonder
,
made
her
pause
,
and
*NL*
in
a
calmer
manner
,
she
added
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
expressions
startle
you
.
You
must
allow
for
an
injured
,
angry
*NL*
woman
.
But
I
will
try
to
command
myself
.
I
will
not
abuse
him
.
I
*NL*
will
only
tell
you
what
I
have
found
him
.
Facts
shall
speak
.
He
was
*NL*
the
intimate
friend
of
my
dear
husband
,
who
trusted
and
loved
him
,
and
*NL*
thought
him
as
good
as
himself
.
The
intimacy
had
been
formed
before
*NL*
our
marriage
.
I
found
them
most
intimate
friends
;
and
I
,
too
,
became
*NL*
excessively
pleased
with
Mr
Elliot
,
and
entertained
the
highest
opinion
*NL*
of
him
.
At
nineteen
,
you
know
,
one
does
not
think
very
seriously
;
but
*NL*
Mr
Elliot
appeared
to
me
quite
as
good
as
others
,
and
much
more
*NL*
agreeable
than
most
others
,
and
we
were
almost
always
together
.
We
*NL*
were
principally
in
town
,
living
in
very
good
style
.
He
was
then
the
*NL*
inferior
in
circumstances
;
he
was
then
the
poor
one
;
he
had
chambers
in
*NL*
the
Temple
,
and
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
support
the
appearance
*NL*
of
a
gentleman
.
He
had
always
a
home
with
us
whenever
he
chose
it
;
he
*NL*
was
always
welcome
;
he
was
like
a
brother
.
My
poor
Charles
,
who
had
*NL*
the
finest
,
most
generous
spirit
in
the
world
,
would
have
divided
his
*NL*
last
farthing
with
him
;
and
I
know
that
his
purse
was
open
to
him
;
I
*NL*
know
that
he
often
assisted
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
must
have
been
about
that
very
period
of
Mr
Elliot
's
life
,
''
said
*NL*
Anne
,
``
which
has
always
excited
my
particular
curiosity
.
It
must
have
*NL*
been
about
the
same
time
that
he
became
known
to
my
father
and
sister
.
*NL*
I
never
knew
him
myself
;
I
only
heard
of
him
;
but
there
was
a
something
*NL*
in
his
conduct
then
,
with
regard
to
my
father
and
sister
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
in
the
circumstances
of
his
marriage
,
which
I
never
could
*NL*
quite
reconcile
with
present
times
.
It
seemed
to
announce
a
different
*NL*
sort
of
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
all
,
I
know
it
all
,
''
cried
Mrs
Smith
.
``
He
had
been
*NL*
introduced
to
Sir
Walter
and
your
sister
before
I
was
acquainted
with
*NL*
him
,
but
I
heard
him
speak
of
them
for
ever
.
I
know
he
was
invited
and
*NL*
encouraged
,
and
I
know
he
did
not
choose
to
go
.
I
can
satisfy
you
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
on
points
which
you
would
little
expect
;
and
as
to
his
*NL*
marriage
,
I
knew
all
about
it
at
the
time
.
I
was
privy
to
all
the
fors
*NL*
and
againsts
;
I
was
the
friend
to
whom
he
confided
his
hopes
and
plans
;
*NL*
and
though
I
did
not
know
his
wife
previously
,
her
inferior
situation
*NL*
in
society
,
indeed
,
rendered
that
impossible
,
yet
I
knew
her
all
her
*NL*
life
afterwards
,
or
at
least
till
within
the
last
two
years
of
her
*NL*
life
,
and
can
answer
any
question
you
may
wish
to
put
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Anne
,
``
I
have
no
particular
enquiry
to
make
about
her
.
I
*NL*
have
always
understood
they
were
not
a
happy
couple
.
But
I
should
like
*NL*
to
know
why
,
at
that
time
of
his
life
,
he
should
slight
my
father
's
*NL*
acquaintance
as
he
did
.
My
father
was
certainly
disposed
to
take
very
*NL*
kind
and
proper
notice
of
him
.
Why
did
Mr
Elliot
draw
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Elliot
,
''
replied
Mrs
Smith
,
``
at
that
period
of
his
life
,
had
one
*NL*
object
in
view
:
to
make
his
fortune
,
and
by
a
rather
quicker
process
*NL*
than
the
law
.
He
was
determined
to
make
it
by
marriage
.
He
was
*NL*
determined
,
at
least
,
not
to
mar
it
by
an
imprudent
marriage
;
and
I
*NL*
know
it
was
his
belief
-LRB-
whether
justly
or
not
,
of
course
I
can
not
*NL*
decide
-RRB-
,
that
your
father
and
sister
,
in
their
civilities
and
*NL*
invitations
,
were
designing
a
match
between
the
heir
and
the
young
*NL*
lady
,
and
it
was
impossible
that
such
a
match
should
have
answered
his
*NL*
ideas
of
wealth
and
independence
.
That
was
his
motive
for
drawing
*NL*
back
,
I
can
assure
you
.
He
told
me
the
whole
story
.
He
had
no
*NL*
concealments
with
me
.
It
was
curious
,
that
having
just
left
you
behind
*NL*
me
in
Bath
,
my
first
and
principal
acquaintance
on
marrying
should
be
*NL*
your
cousin
;
and
that
,
through
him
,
I
should
be
continually
hearing
of
*NL*
your
father
and
sister
.
He
described
one
Miss
Elliot
,
and
I
thought
*NL*
very
affectionately
of
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
cried
Anne
,
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
,
``
you
sometimes
spoke
of
*NL*
me
to
Mr
Elliot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
I
did
;
very
often
.
I
used
to
boast
of
my
own
Anne
Elliot
,
*NL*
and
vouch
for
your
being
a
very
different
creature
from
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
checked
herself
just
in
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
accounts
for
something
which
Mr
Elliot
said
last
night

cried
*NL*
Anne
.
``
This
explains
it
.
I
found
he
had
been
used

hear
of
me
.
I
*NL*
could
not
comprehend
how
.
What
wild
imaginations
one
forms
where
dear
*NL*
self
is
concerned
!
How
sure
to
be
mistaken
!
But
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
*NL*
have
interrupted
you
.
Mr
Elliot
married
then
completely
for
money
?
*NL*
The
circumstances
,
probably
,
which
first
opened
your
eyes
to
his
*NL*
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Smith
hesitated
a
little
here
.
``
Oh
!
those
things
are
too
common
.
*NL*
When
one
lives
in
the
world
,
a
man
or
woman
's
marrying
for
money
is
too
*NL*
common
to
strike
one
as
it
ought
.
I
was
very
young
,
and
associated
*NL*
only
with
the
young
,
and
we
were
a
thoughtless
,
gay
set
,
without
any
*NL*
strict
rules
of
conduct
.
We
lived
for
enjoyment
.
I
think
differently
*NL*
now
;
time
and
sickness
and
sorrow
have
given
me
other
notions
;
but
at
*NL*
that
period
I
must
own
I
saw
nothing
reprehensible
in
what
Mr
Elliot
*NL*
was
doing
.
`
To
do
the
best
for
himself
,
'
passed
as
a
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
was
not
she
a
very
low
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
which
I
objected
to
,
but
he
would
not
regard
.
Money
,
money
,
was
*NL*
all
that
he
wanted
.
Her
father
was
a
grazier
,
her
grandfather
had
been
*NL*
a
butcher
,
but
that
was
all
nothing
.
She
was
a
fine
woman
,
had
had
a
*NL*
decent
education
,
was
brought
forward
by
some
cousins
,
thrown
by
chance
*NL*
into
Mr
Elliot
's
company
,
and
fell
in
love
with
him
;
and
not
a
*NL*
difficulty
or
a
scruple
was
there
on
his
side
,
with
respect
to
her
*NL*
birth
.
All
his
caution
was
spent
in
being
secured
of
the
real
amount
*NL*
of
her
fortune
,
before
he
committed
himself
.
Depend
upon
it
,
whatever
*NL*
esteem
Mr
Elliot
may
have
for
his
own
situation
in
life
now
,
as
a
young
*NL*
man
he
had
not
the
smallest
value
for
it
.
His
chance
for
the
Kellynch
*NL*
estate
was
something
,
but
all
the
honour
of
the
family
he
held
as
cheap
*NL*
as
dirt
.
I
have
often
heard
him
declare
,
that
if
baronetcies
were
*NL*
saleable
,
anybody
should
have
his
for
fifty
pounds
,
arms
and
motto
,
*NL*
name
and
livery
included
;
but
I
will
not
pretend
to
repeat
half
that
I
*NL*
used
to
hear
him
say
on
that
subject
.
It
would
not
be
fair
;
and
yet
*NL*
you
ought
to
have
proof
,
for
what
is
all
this
but
assertion
,
and
you
*NL*
shall
have
proof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
my
dear
Mrs
Smith
,
I
want
none
,
''
cried
Anne
.
``
You
have
*NL*
asserted
nothing
contradictory
to
what
Mr
Elliot
appeared
to
be
some
*NL*
years
ago
.
This
is
all
in
confirmation
,
rather
,
of
what
we
used
to
*NL*
hear
and
believe

I
am
more
curious
to
know
why
he
should
be
so
*NL*
different
now

``
But
for
my
satisfaction

if
you
will

the
goodness

stay

I
am
sure
you
will
have
the
still
greater
goodness
of
*NL*
going
yourself
into
my
bedroom
,
and
bringing
me
the
small
inlaid
box
*NL*
which
you
will
find
on
the
upper
shelf

the
closet

*NL*
Anne
,
seeing
her
friend
to
be
earnestly
bent
on
it
,
did
as
she
was
*NL*
desired

The
box
was
brought
and
placed
before
her
,
and
Mrs
Smith
,
*NL*
sighing
over
it
as
she
unlocked
it
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
full
of
papers
belonging
to
him

to
my
husband
;
a
small
*NL*
portion
only
of
what
I
had
to
look
over
when
I
lost
him
.
The
letter
I
*NL*
am
looking
for
was
one
written
by
Mr
Elliot
to
him
before
our
marriage
,
*NL*
and
happened
to
be
saved
;
why
,
one
can
hardly
imagine
.
But
he
was
*NL*
careless
and
immethodical
,
like
other
men
,
about
those
things
;
and
when
*NL*
I
came
to
examine
his
papers
,
I
found
it
with
others
still
more
*NL*
trivial
,
from
different
people
scattered
here
and
there
,
while
many
*NL*
letters
and
memorandums
of
real
importance
had
been
destroyed
.
Here
it
*NL*
is
;
I
would
not
burn
it
,
because
being
even
then
very
little
satisfied
*NL*
with
Mr
Elliot
,
I
was
determined
to
preserve
every
document
of
former
*NL*
intimacy

I
have
now
another
motive
for
being
glad
that
I
can
produce
*NL*
it

the

directed
to
``

Smith

from

*NL*
``
Dear
Smith
,
--
I
have
received
yours
.
Your
kindness
almost
overpowers
*NL*
me
.
I
wish
nature
had
made
such
hearts
as
yours
more
common
,
but
I
*NL*
have
lived
three-and-twenty
years
in
the
world
,
and
have
seen
none
like
*NL*
it
.
At
present
,
believe
me
,
I
have
no
need
of
your
services
,
being
in
*NL*
cash
again
.
Give
me
joy
:
I
have
got
rid
of
Sir
Walter
and
Miss.
.
They
*NL*
are
gone
back
to
Kellynch
,
and
almost
made
me
swear
to
visit
them
this
*NL*
summer
;
but
my
first
visit
to
Kellynch
will
be
with
a
surveyor
,
to
tell
*NL*
me
how
to
bring
it
with
best
advantage
to
the
hammer
.
The
baronet
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
is
not
unlikely
to
marry
again
;
he
is
quite
fool
enough
.
*NL*
If
he
does
,
however
,
they
will
leave
me
in
peace
,
which
may
be
a
decent
*NL*
equivalent
for
the
reversion
.
He
is
worse
than
last
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
had
any
name
but
Elliot
.
I
am
sick
of
it
.
The
name
of
*NL*
Walter
I
can
drop
,
thank
God
!
and
I
desire
you
will
never
insult
me
*NL*
with
my
second
W.
again
,
meaning
,
for
the
rest
of
my
life
,
to
be
only
*NL*
yours
truly
,
--
Wm.
Elliot

Such
a
letter
could
not
be
read
without
putting
Anne
in
a
glow
;
and
Mrs
*NL*
Smith
,
observing
the
high
colour
in
her
face
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
language
,
I
know
,
is
highly
disrespectful
.
Though
I
have
forgot
*NL*
the
exact
terms
,
I
have
a
perfect
impression
of
the
general
meaning
.
*NL*
But
it
shows
you
the
man
.
Mark
his
professions
to
my
poor
husband
.
*NL*
Can
any
thing
be
stronger
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
could
not
immediately
get
over
the
shock
and
mortification
of
*NL*
finding
such
words
applied
to
her
father
.
She
was
obliged
to
recollect
*NL*
that
her
seeing
the
letter
was
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
honour
,
that
*NL*
no
one
ought
to
be
judged
or
to
be
known
by
such
testimonies
,
that
no
*NL*
private
correspondence
could
bear
the
eye
of
others
,
before
she
could
*NL*
recover
calmness
enough
to
return
the
letter
which
she
had
been
*NL*
meditating
over
,
and
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
This
is
full
proof
undoubtedly
;
proof
of
every
thing
you
*NL*
were
saying
.
But
why
be
acquainted
with
us
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
explain
this
too
,
''
cried
Mrs
Smith
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
have
shewn
you
Mr
Elliot
as
he
was
a
dozen
years
ago
,
and
I
*NL*
will
shew
him
as
he
is
now
.
I
can
not
produce
written
proof
again
,
but
*NL*
I
can
give
as
authentic
oral
testimony
as
you
can
desire
,
of
what
he
is
*NL*
now
wanting
,
and
what
he
is
now
doing
.
He
is
no
hypocrite
now
.
He
*NL*
truly
wants
to
marry
you
.
His
present
attentions
to
your
family
are
*NL*
very
sincere
:
quite
from
the
heart
.
I
will
give
you
my
authority
:
his
*NL*
friend
Colonel
Wallis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
Wallis
!
you
are
acquainted
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
It
does
not
come
to
me
in
quite
so
direct
a
line
as
that
;
it
*NL*
takes
a
bend
or
two
,
but
nothing
of
consequence
.
The
stream
is
as
good
*NL*
as
at
first
;
the
little
rubbish
it
collects
in
the
turnings
is
easily
*NL*
moved
away
.
Mr
Elliot
talks
unreservedly
to
Colonel
Wallis
of
his
*NL*
views
on
you
,
which
said
Colonel
Wallis
,
I
imagine
to
be
,
in
himself
,
a
*NL*
sensible
,
careful
,
discerning
sort
of
character
;
but
Colonel
Wallis
has
*NL*
a
very
pretty
silly
wife
,
to
whom
he
tells
things
which
he
had
better
*NL*
not
,
and
he
repeats
it
all
to
her
.
She
in
the
overflowing
spirits
of
*NL*
her
recovery
,
repeats
it
all
to
her
nurse
;
and
the
nurse
knowing
my
*NL*
acquaintance
with
you
,
very
naturally
brings
it
all
to
me
.
On
Monday
*NL*
evening
,
my
good
friend
Mrs
Rooke
let
me
thus
much
into
the
secrets
of
*NL*
Marlborough
Buildings
.
When
I
talked
of
a
whole
history
,
therefore
,
*NL*
you
see
I
was
not
romancing
so
much
as
you
supposed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Mrs
Smith
,
your
authority
is
deficient
.
This
will
not
do
.
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
's
having
any
views
on
me
will
not
in
the
least
account
for
the
*NL*
efforts
he
made
towards
a
reconciliation
with
my
father
.
That
was
all
*NL*
prior
to
my
coming
to
Bath
.
I
found
them
on
the
most
friendly
terms
*NL*
when
I
arrived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
did
;
I
know
it
all
perfectly
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Mrs
Smith
,
we
must
not
expect
to
get
real
information
in
such
*NL*
a
line
.
Facts
or
opinions
which
are
to
pass
through
the
hands
of
so
*NL*
many
,
to
be
misconceived
by
folly
in
one
,
and
ignorance
in
another
,
can
*NL*
hardly
have
much
truth
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
give
me
a
hearing
.
You
will
soon
be
able
to
judge
of
the
general
*NL*
credit
due
,
by
listening
to
some
particulars
which
you
can
yourself
*NL*
immediately
contradict
or
confirm
.
Nobody
supposes
that
you
were
his
*NL*
first
inducement
.
He
had
seen
you
indeed
,
before
he
came
to
Bath
,
and
*NL*
admired
you
,
but
without
knowing
it
to
be
you
.
So
says
my
historian
,
*NL*
at
least
.
Is
this
true
?
Did
he
see
you
last
summer
or
autumn
,
*NL*
`
somewhere
down
in
the
west
,
'
to
use
her
own
words
,
without
knowing
it
*NL*
to
be
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
certainly
did
.
So
far
it
is
very
true
.
At
Lyme
.
I
happened
to
be
*NL*
at
Lyme
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
continued
Mrs
Smith
,
triumphantly
,
``
grant
my
friend
the
credit
*NL*
due
to
the
establishment
of
the
first
point
asserted
.
He
saw
you
then
*NL*
at
Lyme
,
and
liked
you
so
well
as
to
be
exceedingly
pleased
to
meet
*NL*
with
you
again
in
Camden
Place
,
as
Miss
Anne
Elliot
,
and
from
that
*NL*
moment
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
had
a
double
motive
in
his
visits
there
.
But
*NL*
there
was
another
,
and
an
earlier
,
which
I
will
now
explain
.
If
there
*NL*
is
anything
in
my
story
which
you
know
to
be
either
false
or
*NL*
improbable
,
stop
me
.
My
account
states
,
that
your
sister
's
friend
,
the
*NL*
lady
now
staying
with
you
,
whom
I
have
heard
you
mention
,
came
to
Bath
*NL*
with
Miss
Elliot
and
Sir
Walter
as
long
ago
as
September
-LRB-
in
short
when
*NL*
they
first
came
themselves
-RRB-
,
and
has
been
staying
there
ever
since
;
*NL*
that
she
is
a
clever
,
insinuating
,
handsome
woman
,
poor
and
plausible
,
*NL*
and
altogether
such
in
situation
and
manner
,
as
to
give
a
general
idea
,
*NL*
among
Sir
Walter
's
acquaintance
,
of
her
meaning
to
be
Lady
Elliot
,
and
*NL*
as
general
a
surprise
that
Miss
Elliot
should
be
apparently
,
blind
to
*NL*
the
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mrs
Smith
paused
a
moment
;
but
Anne
had
not
a
word
to
say
,
and
she
*NL*
continued
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
the
light
in
which
it
appeared
to
those
who
knew
the
family
,
*NL*
long
before
you
returned
to
it
;
and
Colonel
Wallis
had
his
eye
upon
*NL*
your
father
enough
to
be
sensible
of
it
,
though
he
did
not
then
visit
*NL*
in
Camden
Place
;
but
his
regard
for
Mr
Elliot
gave
him
an
interest
in
*NL*
watching
all
that
was
going
on
there
,
and
when
Mr
Elliot
came
to
Bath
*NL*
for
a
day
or
two
,
as
he
happened
to
do
a
little
before
Christmas
,
*NL*
Colonel
Wallis
made
him
acquainted
with
the
appearance
of
things
,
and
*NL*
the
reports
beginning
to
prevail
.
Now
you
are
to
understand
,
that
time
*NL*
had
worked
a
very
material
change
in
Mr
Elliot
's
opinions
as
to
the
*NL*
value
of
a
baronetcy
.
Upon
all
points
of
blood
and
connexion
he
is
a
*NL*
completely
altered
man
.
Having
long
had
as
much
money
as
he
could
*NL*
spend
,
nothing
to
wish
for
on
the
side
of
avarice
or
indulgence
,
he
has
*NL*
been
gradually
learning
to
pin
his
happiness
upon
the
consequence
he
is
*NL*
heir
to
.
I
thought
it
coming
on
before
our
acquaintance
ceased
,
but
it
*NL*
is
now
a
confirmed
feeling
.
He
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
not
being
Sir
*NL*
William
.
You
may
guess
,
therefore
,
that
the
news
he
heard
from
his
*NL*
friend
could
not
be
very
agreeable
,
and
you
may
guess
what
it
produced
;
*NL*
the
resolution
of
coming
back
to
Bath
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
of
*NL*
fixing
himself
here
for
a
time
,
with
the
view
of
renewing
his
former
*NL*
acquaintance
,
and
recovering
such
a
footing
in
the
family
as
might
give
*NL*
him
the
means
of
ascertaining
the
degree
of
his
danger
,
and
of
*NL*
circumventing
the
lady
if
he
found
it
material
.
This
was
agreed
upon
*NL*
between
the
two
friends
as
the
only
thing
to
be
done
;
and
Colonel
*NL*
Wallis
was
to
assist
in
every
way
that
he
could
.
He
was
to
be
*NL*
introduced
,
and
Mrs
Wallis
was
to
be
introduced
,
and
everybody
was
to
*NL*
be
introduced
.
Mr
Elliot
came
back
accordingly
;
and
on
application
was
*NL*
forgiven
,
as
you
know
,
and
re-admitted
into
the
family
;
and
there
it
*NL*
was
his
constant
object
,
and
his
only
object
-LRB-
till
your
arrival
added
*NL*
another
motive
-RRB-
,
to
watch
Sir
Walter
and
Mrs
Clay
.
He
omitted
no
*NL*
opportunity
of
being
with
them
,
threw
himself
in
their
way
,
called
at
*NL*
all
hours
;
but
I
need
not
be
particular
on
this
subject
.
You
can
*NL*
imagine
what
an
artful
man
would
do
;
and
with
this
guide
,
perhaps
,
may
*NL*
recollect
what
you
have
seen
him
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Anne
,
``
you
tell
me
nothing
which
does
not
accord
with
what
*NL*
I
have
known
,
or
could
imagine
.
There
is
always
something
offensive
in
*NL*
the
details
of
cunning
.
The
manoeuvres
of
selfishness
and
duplicity
*NL*
must
ever
be
revolting
,
but
I
have
heard
nothing
which
really
surprises
*NL*
me
.
I
know
those
who
would
be
shocked
by
such
a
representation
of
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
,
who
would
have
difficulty
in
believing
it
;
but
I
have
never
*NL*
been
satisfied
.
I
have
always
wanted
some
other
motive
for
his
conduct
*NL*
than
appeared
.
I
should
like
to
know
his
present
opinion
,
as
to
the
*NL*
probability
of
the
event
he
has
been
in
dread
of
;
whether
he
considers
*NL*
the
danger
to
be
lessening
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lessening
,
I
understand
,
''
replied
Mrs
Smith
.
``
He
thinks
Mrs
Clay
*NL*
afraid
of
him
,
aware
that
he
sees
through
her
,
and
not
daring
to
*NL*
proceed
as
she
might
do
in
his
absence
.
But
since
he
must
be
absent
*NL*
some
time
or
other
,
I
do
not
perceive
how
he
can
ever
be
secure
while
*NL*
she
holds
her
present
influence
.
Mrs
Wallis
has
an
amusing
idea
,
as
*NL*
nurse
tells
me
,
that
it
is
to
be
put
into
the
marriage
articles
when
*NL*
you
and
Mr
Elliot
marry
,
that
your
father
is
not
to
marry
Mrs
Clay
.
A
*NL*
scheme
,
worthy
of
Mrs
Wallis
's
understanding
,
by
all
accounts
;
but
my
*NL*
sensible
nurse
Rooke
sees
the
absurdity
of
it
.
`
Why
,
to
be
sure
,
*NL*
ma'am
,
'
said
she
,
`
it
would
not
prevent
his
marrying
anybody
else
.
'
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
to
own
the
truth
,
I
do
not
think
nurse
,
in
her
heart
,
is
a
*NL*
very
strenuous
opposer
of
Sir
Walter
's
making
a
second
match
.
She
must
*NL*
be
allowed
to
be
a
favourer
of
matrimony
,
you
know
;
and
-LRB-
since
self
*NL*
will
intrude
-RRB-
who
can
say
that
she
may
not
have
some
flying
visions
of
*NL*
attending
the
next
Lady
Elliot
,
through
Mrs
Wallis
's
recommendation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
know
all
this
,
''
said
Anne
,
after
a
little
*NL*
thoughtfulness
.
``
It
will
be
more
painful
to
me
in
some
respects
to
be
*NL*
in
company
with
him
,
but
I
shall
know
better
what
to
do
.
My
line
of
*NL*
conduct
will
be
more
direct
.
Mr
Elliot
is
evidently
a
disingenuous
,
*NL*
artificial
,
worldly
man
,
who
has
never
had
any
better
principle
to
*NL*
guide
him
than
selfishness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr
Elliot
was
not
done
with
.
Mrs
Smith
had
been
carried
away
from
*NL*
her
first
direction
,
and
Anne
had
forgotten
,
in
the
interest
of
her
own
*NL*
family
concerns
,
how
much
had
been
originally
implied
against
him
;
but
*NL*
her
attention
was
now
called
to
the
explanation
of
those
first
hints
,
*NL*
and
she
listened
to
a
recital
which
,
if
it
did
not
perfectly
justify
*NL*
the
unqualified
bitterness
of
Mrs
Smith
,
proved
him
to
have
been
very
*NL*
unfeeling
in
his
conduct
towards
her
;
very
deficient
both
in
justice
*NL*
and
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
learned
that
-LRB-
the
intimacy
between
them
continuing
unimpaired
by
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
's
marriage
-RRB-
they
had
been
as
before
always
together
,
and
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
had
led
his
friend
into
expenses
much
beyond
his
fortune
.
Mrs
*NL*
Smith
did
not
want
to
take
blame
to
herself
,
and
was
most
tender
of
*NL*
throwing
any
on
her
husband
;
but
Anne
could
collect
that
their
income
*NL*
had
never
been
equal
to
their
style
of
living
,
and
that
from
the
first
*NL*
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
general
and
joint
extravagance
.
From
*NL*
his
wife
's
account
of
him
she
could
discern
Mr
Smith
to
have
been
a
man
*NL*
of
warm
feelings
,
easy
temper
,
careless
habits
,
and
not
strong
*NL*
understanding
,
much
more
amiable
than
his
friend
,
and
very
unlike
him
,
*NL*
led
by
him
,
and
probably
despised
by
him
.
Mr
Elliot
,
raised
by
his
*NL*
marriage
to
great
affluence
,
and
disposed
to
every
gratification
of
*NL*
pleasure
and
vanity
which
could
be
commanded
without
involving
himself
,
*NL*
-LRB-
for
with
all
his
self-indulgence
he
had
become
a
prudent
man
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
beginning
to
be
rich
,
just
as
his
friend
ought
to
have
found
himself
to
*NL*
be
poor
,
seemed
to
have
had
no
concern
at
all
for
that
friend
's
*NL*
probable
finances
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
been
prompting
and
*NL*
encouraging
expenses
which
could
end
only
in
ruin
;
and
the
Smiths
*NL*
accordingly
had
been
ruined
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
husband
had
died
just
in
time
to
be
spared
the
full
knowledge
of
*NL*
it
.
They
had
previously
known
embarrassments
enough
to
try
the
*NL*
friendship
of
their
friends
,
and
to
prove
that
Mr
Elliot
's
had
better
*NL*
not
be
tried
;
but
it
was
not
till
his
death
that
the
wretched
state
of
*NL*
his
affairs
was
fully
known
.
With
a
confidence
in
Mr
Elliot
's
regard
,
*NL*
more
creditable
to
his
feelings
than
his
judgement
,
Mr
Smith
had
*NL*
appointed
him
the
executor
of
his
will
;
but
Mr
Elliot
would
not
act
,
*NL*
and
the
difficulties
and
distress
which
this
refusal
had
heaped
on
her
,
*NL*
in
addition
to
the
inevitable
sufferings
of
her
situation
,
had
been
*NL*
such
as
could
not
be
related
without
anguish
of
spirit
,
or
listened
to
*NL*
without
corresponding
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
shewn
some
letters
of
his
on
the
occasion
,
answers
to
urgent
*NL*
applications
from
Mrs
Smith
,
which
all
breathed
the
same
stern
*NL*
resolution
of
not
engaging
in
a
fruitless
trouble
,
and
,
under
a
cold
*NL*
civility
,
the
same
hard-hearted
indifference
to
any
of
the
evils
it
*NL*
might
bring
on
her
.
It
was
a
dreadful
picture
of
ingratitude
and
*NL*
inhumanity
;
and
Anne
felt
,
at
some
moments
,
that
no
flagrant
open
crime
*NL*
could
have
been
worse
.
She
had
a
great
deal
to
listen
to
;
all
the
*NL*
particulars
of
past
sad
scenes
,
all
the
minutiae
of
distress
upon
*NL*
distress
,
which
in
former
conversations
had
been
merely
hinted
at
,
were
*NL*
dwelt
on
now
with
a
natural
indulgence
.
Anne
could
perfectly
*NL*
comprehend
the
exquisite
relief
,
and
was
only
the
more
inclined
to
*NL*
wonder
at
the
composure
of
her
friend
's
usual
state
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
circumstance
in
the
history
of
her
grievances
of
*NL*
particular
irritation
.
She
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
some
*NL*
property
of
her
husband
in
the
West
Indies
,
which
had
been
for
many
*NL*
years
under
a
sort
of
sequestration
for
the
payment
of
its
own
*NL*
incumbrances
,
might
be
recoverable
by
proper
measures
;
and
this
*NL*
property
,
though
not
large
,
would
be
enough
to
make
her
comparatively
*NL*
rich
.
But
there
was
nobody
to
stir
in
it
.
Mr
Elliot
would
do
nothing
,
*NL*
and
she
could
do
nothing
herself
,
equally
disabled
from
personal
*NL*
exertion
by
her
state
of
bodily
weakness
,
and
from
employing
others
by
*NL*
her
want
of
money
.
She
had
no
natural
connexions
to
assist
her
even
*NL*
with
their
counsel
,
and
she
could
not
afford
to
purchase
the
assistance
*NL*
of
the
law
.
This
was
a
cruel
aggravation
of
actually
straitened
means
.
*NL*
To
feel
that
she
ought
to
be
in
better
circumstances
,
that
a
little
*NL*
trouble
in
the
right
place
might
do
it
,
and
to
fear
that
delay
might
be
*NL*
even
weakening
her
claims
,
was
hard
to
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
this
point
that
she
had
hoped
to
engage
Anne
's
good
offices
*NL*
with
Mr
Elliot
.
She
had
previously
,
in
the
anticipation
of
their
*NL*
marriage
,
been
very
apprehensive
of
losing
her
friend
by
it
;
but
on
*NL*
being
assured
that
he
could
have
made
no
attempt
of
that
nature
,
since
*NL*
he
did
not
even
know
her
to
be
in
Bath
,
it
immediately
occurred
,
that
*NL*
something
might
be
done
in
her
favour
by
the
influence
of
the
woman
he
*NL*
loved
,
and
she
had
been
hastily
preparing
to
interest
Anne
's
feelings
,
*NL*
as
far
as
the
observances
due
to
Mr
Elliot
's
character
would
allow
,
*NL*
when
Anne
's
refutation
of
the
supposed
engagement
changed
the
face
of
*NL*
everything
;
and
while
it
took
from
her
the
new-formed
hope
of
*NL*
succeeding
in
the
object
of
her
first
anxiety
,
left
her
at
least
the
*NL*
comfort
of
telling
the
whole
story
her
own
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
listening
to
this
full
description
of
Mr
Elliot
,
Anne
could
not
*NL*
but
express
some
surprise
at
Mrs
Smith
's
having
spoken
of
him
so
*NL*
favourably
in
the
beginning
of
their
conversation
.
``
She
had
seemed
to
*NL*
recommend
and
praise
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
was
Mrs
Smith
's
reply
,
``
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
.
*NL*
I
considered
your
marrying
him
as
certain
,
though
he
might
not
yet
have
*NL*
made
the
offer
,
and
I
could
no
more
speak
the
truth
of
him
,
than
if
he
*NL*
had
been
your
husband
.
My
heart
bled
for
you
,
as
I
talked
of
*NL*
happiness
;
and
yet
he
is
sensible
,
he
is
agreeable
,
and
with
such
a
*NL*
woman
as
you
,
it
was
not
absolutely
hopeless
.
He
was
very
unkind
to
*NL*
his
first
wife
.
They
were
wretched
together
.
But
she
was
too
ignorant
*NL*
and
giddy
for
respect
,
and
he
had
never
loved
her
.
I
was
willing
to
*NL*
hope
that
you
must
fare
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
could
just
acknowledge
within
herself
such
a
possibility
of
having
*NL*
been
induced
to
marry
him
,
as
made
her
shudder
at
the
idea
of
the
*NL*
misery
which
must
have
followed
.
It
was
just
possible
that
she
might
*NL*
have
been
persuaded
by
Lady
Russell
!
And
under
such
a
supposition
,
*NL*
which
would
have
been
most
miserable
,
when
time
had
disclosed
all
,
too
*NL*
late
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
desirable
that
Lady
Russell
should
be
no
longer
deceived
;
*NL*
and
one
of
the
concluding
arrangements
of
this
important
conference
,
*NL*
which
carried
them
through
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
,
was
,
that
*NL*
Anne
had
full
liberty
to
communicate
to
her
friend
everything
relative
*NL*
to
Mrs
Smith
,
in
which
his
conduct
was
involved
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
22
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
went
home
to
think
over
all
that
she
had
heard
.
In
one
point
,
her
*NL*
feelings
were
relieved
by
this
knowledge
of
Mr
Elliot
.
There
was
no
*NL*
longer
anything
of
tenderness
due
to
him
.
He
stood
as
opposed
to
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
all
his
own
unwelcome
obtrusiveness
;
and
the
evil
*NL*
of
his
attentions
last
night
,
the
irremediable
mischief
he
might
have
*NL*
done
,
was
considered
with
sensations
unqualified
,
unperplexed
.
Pity
*NL*
for
him
was
all
over
.
But
this
was
the
only
point
of
relief
.
In
every
*NL*
other
respect
,
in
looking
around
her
,
or
penetrating
forward
,
she
saw
*NL*
more
to
distrust
and
to
apprehend
.
She
was
concerned
for
the
*NL*
disappointment
and
pain
Lady
Russell
would
be
feeling
;
for
the
*NL*
mortifications
which
must
be
hanging
over
her
father
and
sister
,
and
*NL*
had
all
the
distress
of
foreseeing
many
evils
,
without
knowing
how
to
*NL*
avert
any
one
of
them
.
She
was
most
thankful
for
her
own
knowledge
of
*NL*
him
.
She
had
never
considered
herself
as
entitled
to
reward
for
not
*NL*
slighting
an
old
friend
like
Mrs
Smith
,
but
here
was
a
reward
indeed
*NL*
springing
from
it
!
Mrs
Smith
had
been
able
to
tell
her
what
no
one
*NL*
else
could
have
done
.
Could
the
knowledge
have
been
extended
through
*NL*
her
family
?
But
this
was
a
vain
idea
.
She
must
talk
to
Lady
Russell
,
*NL*
tell
her
,
consult
with
her
,
and
having
done
her
best
,
wait
the
event
*NL*
with
as
much
composure
as
possible
;
and
after
all
,
her
greatest
want
of
*NL*
composure
would
be
in
that
quarter
of
the
mind
which
could
not
be
*NL*
opened
to
Lady
Russell
;
in
that
flow
of
anxieties
and
fears
which
must
*NL*
be
all
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
,
on
reaching
home
,
that
she
had
,
as
she
intended
,
escaped
*NL*
seeing
Mr
Elliot
;
that
he
had
called
and
paid
them
a
long
morning
*NL*
visit
;
but
hardly
had
she
congratulated
herself
,
and
felt
safe
,
when
*NL*
she
heard
that
he
was
coming
again
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
the
smallest
intention
of
asking
him
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
with
*NL*
affected
carelessness
,
``
but
he
gave
so
many
hints
;
so
Mrs
Clay
says
,
at
*NL*
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
do
say
it
.
I
never
saw
anybody
in
my
life
spell
harder
for
*NL*
an
invitation
.
Poor
man
!
I
was
really
in
pain
for
him
;
for
your
*NL*
hard-hearted
sister
,
Miss
Anne
,
seems
bent
on
cruelty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
cried
Elizabeth
,
``
I
have
been
rather
too
much
used
to
the
game
to
*NL*
be
soon
overcome
by
a
gentleman
's
hints
.
However
,
when
I
found
how
*NL*
excessively
he
was
regretting
that
he
should
miss
my
father
this
*NL*
morning
,
I
gave
way
immediately
,
for
I
would
never
really
omit
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
bringing
him
and
Sir
Walter
together
.
They
appear
to
so
*NL*
much
advantage
in
company
with
each
other
.
Each
behaving
so
*NL*
pleasantly
.
Mr
Elliot
looking
up
with
so
much
respect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
delightful
!
''
cried
Mrs
Clay
,
not
daring
,
however
,
to
turn
her
*NL*
eyes
towards
Anne
.
``
Exactly
like
father
and
son
!
Dear
Miss
Elliot
,
*NL*
may
I
not
say
father
and
son
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
lay
no
embargo
on
any
body
's
words
.
If
you
will
have
such
*NL*
ideas
!
But
,
upon
my
word
,
I
am
scarcely
sensible
of
his
attentions
*NL*
being
beyond
those
of
other
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Elliot
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs
Clay
,
lifting
her
hands
and
eyes
,
*NL*
and
sinking
all
the
rest
of
her
astonishment
in
a
convenient
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
Penelope
,
you
need
not
be
so
alarmed
about
him
.
I
did
*NL*
invite
him
,
you
know
.
I
sent
him
away
with
smiles
.
When
I
found
he
*NL*
was
really
going
to
his
friends
at
Thornberry
Park
for
the
whole
day
*NL*
to-morrow
,
I
had
compassion
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
admired
the
good
acting
of
the
friend
,
in
being
able
to
shew
such
*NL*
pleasure
as
she
did
,
in
the
expectation
and
in
the
actual
arrival
of
*NL*
the
very
person
whose
presence
must
really
be
interfering
with
her
*NL*
prime
object
.
It
was
impossible
but
that
Mrs
Clay
must
hate
the
sight
*NL*
of
Mr
Elliot
;
and
yet
she
could
assume
a
most
obliging
,
placid
look
,
*NL*
and
appear
quite
satisfied
with
the
curtailed
license
of
devoting
*NL*
herself
only
half
as
much
to
Sir
Walter
as
she
would
have
done
*NL*
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Anne
herself
it
was
most
distressing
to
see
Mr
Elliot
enter
the
*NL*
room
;
and
quite
painful
to
have
him
approach
and
speak
to
her
.
She
had
*NL*
been
used
before
to
feel
that
he
could
not
be
always
quite
sincere
,
but
*NL*
now
she
saw
insincerity
in
everything
.
His
attentive
deference
to
her
*NL*
father
,
contrasted
with
his
former
language
,
was
odious
;
and
when
she
*NL*
thought
of
his
cruel
conduct
towards
Mrs
Smith
,
she
could
hardly
bear
*NL*
the
sight
of
his
present
smiles
and
mildness
,
or
the
sound
of
his
*NL*
artificial
good
sentiments
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
meant
to
avoid
any
such
alteration
of
manners
as
might
provoke
a
*NL*
remonstrance
on
his
side
.
It
was
a
great
object
to
her
to
escape
all
*NL*
enquiry
or
eclat
;
but
it
was
her
intention
to
be
as
decidedly
cool
to
*NL*
him
as
might
be
compatible
with
their
relationship
;
and
to
retrace
,
as
*NL*
quietly
as
she
could
,
the
few
steps
of
unnecessary
intimacy
she
had
*NL*
been
gradually
led
along
.
She
was
accordingly
more
guarded
,
and
more
*NL*
cool
,
than
she
had
been
the
night
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
animate
her
curiosity
again
as
to
how
and
where
he
could
*NL*
have
heard
her
formerly
praised
;
wanted
very
much
to
be
gratified
by
*NL*
more
solicitation
;
but
the
charm
was
broken
:
he
found
that
the
heat
and
*NL*
animation
of
a
public
room
was
necessary
to
kindle
his
modest
cousin
's
*NL*
vanity
;
he
found
,
at
least
,
that
it
was
not
to
be
done
now
,
by
any
of
*NL*
those
attempts
which
he
could
hazard
among
the
too-commanding
claims
of
*NL*
the
others
.
He
little
surmised
that
it
was
a
subject
acting
now
*NL*
exactly
against
his
interest
,
bringing
immediately
to
her
thoughts
all
*NL*
those
parts
of
his
conduct
which
were
least
excusable
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
some
satisfaction
in
finding
that
he
was
really
going
out
of
*NL*
Bath
the
next
morning
,
going
early
,
and
that
he
would
be
gone
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
two
days
.
He
was
invited
again
to
Camden
Place
the
*NL*
very
evening
of
his
return
;
but
from
Thursday
to
Saturday
evening
his
*NL*
absence
was
certain
.
It
was
bad
enough
that
a
Mrs
Clay
should
be
*NL*
always
before
her
;
but
that
a
deeper
hypocrite
should
be
added
to
their
*NL*
party
,
seemed
the
destruction
of
everything
like
peace
and
comfort
.
It
*NL*
was
so
humiliating
to
reflect
on
the
constant
deception
practised
on
*NL*
her
father
and
Elizabeth
;
to
consider
the
various
sources
of
*NL*
mortification
preparing
for
them
!
Mrs
Clay
's
selfishness
was
not
so
*NL*
complicate
nor
so
revolting
as
his
;
and
Anne
would
have
compounded
for
*NL*
the
marriage
at
once
,
with
all
its
evils
,
to
be
clear
of
Mr
Elliot
's
*NL*
subtleties
in
endeavouring
to
prevent
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Friday
morning
she
meant
to
go
very
early
to
Lady
Russell
,
and
*NL*
accomplish
the
necessary
communication
;
and
she
would
have
gone
*NL*
directly
after
breakfast
,
but
that
Mrs
Clay
was
also
going
out
on
some
*NL*
obliging
purpose
of
saving
her
sister
trouble
,
which
determined
her
to
*NL*
wait
till
she
might
be
safe
from
such
a
companion
.
She
saw
Mrs
Clay
*NL*
fairly
off
,
therefore
,
before
she
began
to
talk
of
spending
the
morning
*NL*
in
Rivers
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
I
have
nothing
to
send
but
my
love
.
Oh
!
*NL*
you
may
as
well
take
back
that
tiresome
book
she
would
lend
me
,
and
*NL*
pretend
I
have
read
it
through
.
I
really
can
not
be
plaguing
myself
for
*NL*
ever
with
all
the
new
poems
and
states
of
the
nation
that
come
out
.
*NL*
Lady
Russell
quite
bores
one
with
her
new
publications
.
You
need
not
*NL*
tell
her
so
,
but
I
thought
her
dress
hideous
the
other
night
.
I
used
*NL*
to
think
she
had
some
taste
in
dress
,
but
I
was
ashamed
of
her
at
the
*NL*
concert
.
Something
so
formal
and
arrange
in
her
air
!
and
she
sits
so
*NL*
upright
!
My
best
love
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
mine
,
''
added
Sir
Walter
.
``
Kindest
regards
.
And
you
may
say
,
that
*NL*
I
mean
to
call
upon
her
soon
.
Make
a
civil
message
;
but
I
shall
only
*NL*
leave
my
card
.
Morning
visits
are
never
fair
by
women
at
her
time
of
*NL*
life
,
who
make
themselves
up
so
little
.
If
she
would
only
wear
rouge
*NL*
she
would
not
be
afraid
of
being
seen
;
but
last
time
I
called
,
I
*NL*
observed
the
blinds
were
let
down
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
her
father
spoke
,
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
.
Who
could
it
*NL*
be
?
Anne
,
remembering
the
preconcerted
visits
,
at
all
hours
,
of
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
,
would
have
expected
him
,
but
for
his
known
engagement
seven
*NL*
miles
off
.
After
the
usual
period
of
suspense
,
the
usual
sounds
of
*NL*
approach
were
heard
,
and
``
Mr
and
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
''
were
ushered
*NL*
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Surprise
was
the
strongest
emotion
raised
by
their
appearance
;
but
Anne
*NL*
was
really
glad
to
see
them
;
and
the
others
were
not
so
sorry
but
that
*NL*
they
could
put
on
a
decent
air
of
welcome
;
and
as
soon
as
it
became
*NL*
clear
that
these
,
their
nearest
relations
,
were
not
arrived
with
any
*NL*
views
of
accommodation
in
that
house
,
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
were
*NL*
able
to
rise
in
cordiality
,
and
do
the
honours
of
it
very
well
.
They
*NL*
were
come
to
Bath
for
a
few
days
with
Mrs
Musgrove
,
and
were
at
the
*NL*
White
Hart
.
So
much
was
pretty
soon
understood
;
but
till
Sir
Walter
*NL*
and
Elizabeth
were
walking
Mary
into
the
other
drawing-room
,
and
*NL*
regaling
themselves
with
her
admiration
,
Anne
could
not
draw
upon
*NL*
Charles
's
brain
for
a
regular
history
of
their
coming
,
or
an
*NL*
explanation
of
some
smiling
hints
of
particular
business
,
which
had
*NL*
been
ostentatiously
dropped
by
Mary
,
as
well
as
of
some
apparent
*NL*
confusion
as
to
whom
their
party
consisted
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
found
that
it
consisted
of
Mrs
Musgrove
,
Henrietta
,
and
*NL*
Captain
Harville
,
beside
their
two
selves
.
He
gave
her
a
very
plain
,
*NL*
intelligible
account
of
the
whole
;
a
narration
in
which
she
saw
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
most
characteristic
proceeding
.
The
scheme
had
received
its
*NL*
first
impulse
by
Captain
Harville
's
wanting
to
come
to
Bath
on
*NL*
business
.
He
had
begun
to
talk
of
it
a
week
ago
;
and
by
way
of
doing
*NL*
something
,
as
shooting
was
over
,
Charles
had
proposed
coming
with
him
,
*NL*
and
Mrs
Harville
had
seemed
to
like
the
idea
of
it
very
much
,
as
an
*NL*
advantage
to
her
husband
;
but
Mary
could
not
bear
to
be
left
,
and
had
*NL*
made
herself
so
unhappy
about
it
,
that
for
a
day
or
two
everything
*NL*
seemed
to
be
in
suspense
,
or
at
an
end
.
But
then
,
it
had
been
taken
up
*NL*
by
his
father
and
mother
.
His
mother
had
some
old
friends
in
Bath
whom
*NL*
she
wanted
to
see
;
it
was
thought
a
good
opportunity
for
Henrietta
to
*NL*
come
and
buy
wedding-clothes
for
herself
and
her
sister
;
and
,
in
short
,
*NL*
it
ended
in
being
his
mother
's
party
,
that
everything
might
be
*NL*
comfortable
and
easy
to
Captain
Harville
;
and
he
and
Mary
were
included
*NL*
in
it
by
way
of
general
convenience
.
They
had
arrived
late
the
night
*NL*
before
.
Mrs
Harville
,
her
children
,
and
Captain
Benwick
,
remained
with
*NL*
Mr
Musgrove
and
Louisa
at
Uppercross
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
only
surprise
was
,
that
affairs
should
be
in
forwardness
enough
*NL*
for
Henrietta
's
wedding-clothes
to
be
talked
of
.
She
had
imagined
such
*NL*
difficulties
of
fortune
to
exist
there
as
must
prevent
the
marriage
*NL*
from
being
near
at
hand
;
but
she
learned
from
Charles
that
,
very
*NL*
recently
,
-LRB-
since
Mary
's
last
letter
to
herself
-RRB-
,
Charles
Hayter
had
*NL*
been
applied
to
by
a
friend
to
hold
a
living
for
a
youth
who
could
not
*NL*
possibly
claim
it
under
many
years
;
and
that
on
the
strength
of
his
*NL*
present
income
,
with
almost
a
certainty
of
something
more
permanent
*NL*
long
before
the
term
in
question
,
the
two
families
had
consented
to
the
*NL*
young
people
's
wishes
,
and
that
their
marriage
was
likely
to
take
place
*NL*
in
a
few
months
,
quite
as
soon
as
Louisa
's
.
``
And
a
very
good
living
it
*NL*
was
,
''
Charles
added
:
``
only
five-and-twenty
miles
from
Uppercross
,
and
*NL*
in
a
very
fine
country
:
fine
part
of
Dorsetshire
.
In
the
centre
of
*NL*
some
of
the
best
preserves
in
the
kingdom
,
surrounded
by
three
great
*NL*
proprietors
,
each
more
careful
and
jealous
than
the
other
;
and
to
two
*NL*
of
the
three
at
least
,
Charles
Hayter
might
get
a
special
*NL*
recommendation
.
Not
that
he
will
value
it
as
he
ought
,
''
he
observed
,
*NL*
``
Charles
is
too
cool
about
sporting
.
That
's
the
worst
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
extremely
glad
,
indeed
,
''
cried
Anne
,
``
particularly
glad
that
this
*NL*
should
happen
;
and
that
of
two
sisters
,
who
both
deserve
equally
well
,
*NL*
and
who
have
always
been
such
good
friends
,
the
pleasant
prospect
of
*NL*
one
should
not
be
dimming
those
of
the
other
--
that
they
should
be
so
*NL*
equal
in
their
prosperity
and
comfort
.
I
hope
your
father
and
mother
*NL*
are
quite
happy
with
regard
to
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
.
My
father
would
be
well
pleased
if
the
gentlemen
were
*NL*
richer
,
but
he
has
no
other
fault
to
find
.
Money
,
you
know
,
coming
*NL*
down
with
money
--
two
daughters
at
once
--
it
can
not
be
a
very
agreeable
*NL*
operation
,
and
it
streightens
him
as
to
many
things
.
However
,
I
do
not
*NL*
mean
to
say
they
have
not
a
right
to
it
.
It
is
very
fit
they
should
*NL*
have
daughters
'
shares
;
and
I
am
sure
he
has
always
been
a
very
kind
,
*NL*
liberal
father
to
me
.
Mary
does
not
above
half
like
Henrietta
's
match
.
*NL*
She
never
did
,
you
know
.
But
she
does
not
do
him
justice
,
nor
think
*NL*
enough
about
Winthrop
.
I
can
not
make
her
attend
to
the
value
of
the
*NL*
property
.
It
is
a
very
fair
match
,
as
times
go
;
and
I
have
liked
*NL*
Charles
Hayter
all
my
life
,
and
I
shall
not
leave
off
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
excellent
parents
as
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
,
''
exclaimed
Anne
,
*NL*
``
should
be
happy
in
their
children
's
marriages
.
They
do
everything
to
*NL*
confer
happiness
,
I
am
sure
.
What
a
blessing
to
young
people
to
be
in
*NL*
such
hands
!
Your
father
and
mother
seem
so
totally
free
from
all
those
*NL*
ambitious
feelings
which
have
led
to
so
much
misconduct
and
misery
,
*NL*
both
in
young
and
old
.
I
hope
you
think
Louisa
perfectly
recovered
*NL*
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
rather
hesitatingly
,
``
Yes
,
I
believe
I
do
;
very
much
*NL*
recovered
;
but
she
is
altered
;
there
is
no
running
or
jumping
about
,
no
*NL*
laughing
or
dancing
;
it
is
quite
different
.
If
one
happens
only
to
*NL*
shut
the
door
a
little
hard
,
she
starts
and
wriggles
like
a
young
*NL*
dab-chick
in
the
water
;
and
Benwick
sits
at
her
elbow
,
reading
verses
,
*NL*
or
whispering
to
her
,
all
day
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
could
not
help
laughing
.
``
That
can
not
be
much
to
your
taste
,
I
*NL*
know
,
''
said
she
;
``
but
I
do
believe
him
to
be
an
excellent
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
he
is
.
Nobody
doubts
it
;
and
I
hope
you
do
not
think
I
am
*NL*
so
illiberal
as
to
want
every
man
to
have
the
same
objects
and
*NL*
pleasures
as
myself
.
I
have
a
great
value
for
Benwick
;
and
when
one
*NL*
can
but
get
him
to
talk
,
he
has
plenty
to
say
.
His
reading
has
done
*NL*
him
no
harm
,
for
he
has
fought
as
well
as
read
.
He
is
a
brave
fellow
.
*NL*
I
got
more
acquainted
with
him
last
Monday
than
ever
I
did
before
.
We
*NL*
had
a
famous
set-to
at
rat-hunting
all
the
morning
in
my
father
's
great
*NL*
barns
;
and
he
played
his
part
so
well
that
I
have
liked
him
the
better
*NL*
ever
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
they
were
interrupted
by
the
absolute
necessity
of
Charles
's
*NL*
following
the
others
to
admire
mirrors
and
china
;
but
Anne
had
heard
*NL*
enough
to
understand
the
present
state
of
Uppercross
,
and
rejoice
in
*NL*
its
happiness
;
and
though
she
sighed
as
she
rejoiced
,
her
sigh
had
none
*NL*
of
the
ill-will
of
envy
in
it
.
She
would
certainly
have
risen
to
their
*NL*
blessings
if
she
could
,
but
she
did
not
want
to
lessen
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visit
passed
off
altogether
in
high
good
humour
.
Mary
was
in
*NL*
excellent
spirits
,
enjoying
the
gaiety
and
the
change
,
and
so
well
*NL*
satisfied
with
the
journey
in
her
mother-in-law
's
carriage
with
four
*NL*
horses
,
and
with
her
own
complete
independence
of
Camden
Place
,
that
*NL*
she
was
exactly
in
a
temper
to
admire
everything
as
she
ought
,
and
*NL*
enter
most
readily
into
all
the
superiorities
of
the
house
,
as
they
*NL*
were
detailed
to
her
.
She
had
no
demands
on
her
father
or
sister
,
and
*NL*
her
consequence
was
just
enough
increased
by
their
handsome
*NL*
drawing-rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
,
for
a
short
time
,
suffering
a
good
deal
.
She
felt
that
*NL*
Mrs
Musgrove
and
all
her
party
ought
to
be
asked
to
dine
with
them
;
but
*NL*
she
could
not
bear
to
have
the
difference
of
style
,
the
reduction
of
*NL*
servants
,
which
a
dinner
must
betray
,
witnessed
by
those
who
had
been
*NL*
always
so
inferior
to
the
Elliots
of
Kellynch
.
It
was
a
struggle
*NL*
between
propriety
and
vanity
;
but
vanity
got
the
better
,
and
then
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
happy
again
.
These
were
her
internal
persuasions
:
``
Old
*NL*
fashioned
notions
;
country
hospitality
;
we
do
not
profess
to
give
*NL*
dinners
;
few
people
in
Bath
do
;
Lady
Alicia
never
does
;
did
not
even
*NL*
ask
her
own
sister
's
family
,
though
they
were
here
a
month
:
and
I
dare
*NL*
say
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
to
Mrs
Musgrove
;
put
her
quite
out
of
*NL*
her
way
.
I
am
sure
she
would
rather
not
come
;
she
can
not
feel
easy
*NL*
with
us
.
I
will
ask
them
all
for
an
evening
;
that
will
be
much
better
;
*NL*
that
will
be
a
novelty
and
a
treat
.
They
have
not
seen
two
such
*NL*
drawing
rooms
before
.
They
will
be
delighted
to
come
to-morrow
*NL*
evening
.
It
shall
be
a
regular
party
,
small
,
but
most
elegant
.
''
And
*NL*
this
satisfied
Elizabeth
:
and
when
the
invitation
was
given
to
the
two
*NL*
present
,
and
promised
for
the
absent
,
Mary
was
as
completely
satisfied
.
*NL*
She
was
particularly
asked
to
meet
Mr
Elliot
,
and
be
introduced
to
Lady
*NL*
Dalrymple
and
Miss
Carteret
,
who
were
fortunately
already
engaged
to
*NL*
come
;
and
she
could
not
have
received
a
more
gratifying
attention
.
*NL*
Miss
Elliot
was
to
have
the
honour
of
calling
on
Mrs
Musgrove
in
the
*NL*
course
of
the
morning
;
and
Anne
walked
off
with
Charles
and
Mary
,
to
go
*NL*
and
see
her
and
Henrietta
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
plan
of
sitting
with
Lady
Russell
must
give
way
for
the
present
.
*NL*
They
all
three
called
in
Rivers
Street
for
a
couple
of
minutes
;
but
*NL*
Anne
convinced
herself
that
a
day
's
delay
of
the
intended
communication
*NL*
could
be
of
no
consequence
,
and
hastened
forward
to
the
White
Hart
,
to
*NL*
see
again
the
friends
and
companions
of
the
last
autumn
,
with
an
*NL*
eagerness
of
good-will
which
many
associations
contributed
to
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
Mrs
Musgrove
and
her
daughter
within
,
and
by
themselves
,
and
*NL*
Anne
had
the
kindest
welcome
from
each
.
Henrietta
was
exactly
in
that
*NL*
state
of
recently-improved
views
,
of
fresh-formed
happiness
,
which
made
*NL*
her
full
of
regard
and
interest
for
everybody
she
had
ever
liked
before
*NL*
at
all
;
and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
real
affection
had
been
won
by
her
*NL*
usefulness
when
they
were
in
distress
.
It
was
a
heartiness
,
and
a
*NL*
warmth
,
and
a
sincerity
which
Anne
delighted
in
the
more
,
from
the
sad
*NL*
want
of
such
blessings
at
home
.
She
was
entreated
to
give
them
as
much
*NL*
of
her
time
as
possible
,
invited
for
every
day
and
all
day
long
,
or
*NL*
rather
claimed
as
part
of
the
family
;
and
,
in
return
,
she
naturally
*NL*
fell
into
all
her
wonted
ways
of
attention
and
assistance
,
and
on
*NL*
Charles
's
leaving
them
together
,
was
listening
to
Mrs
Musgrove
's
*NL*
history
of
Louisa
,
and
to
Henrietta
's
of
herself
,
giving
opinions
on
*NL*
business
,
and
recommendations
to
shops
;
with
intervals
of
every
help
*NL*
which
Mary
required
,
from
altering
her
ribbon
to
settling
her
accounts
;
*NL*
from
finding
her
keys
,
and
assorting
her
trinkets
,
to
trying
to
*NL*
convince
her
that
she
was
not
ill-used
by
anybody
;
which
Mary
,
well
*NL*
amused
as
she
generally
was
,
in
her
station
at
a
window
overlooking
the
*NL*
entrance
to
the
Pump
Room
,
could
not
but
have
her
moments
of
imagining
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
morning
of
thorough
confusion
was
to
be
expected
.
A
large
party
in
*NL*
an
hotel
ensured
a
quick-changing
,
unsettled
scene
.
One
five
minutes
*NL*
brought
a
note
,
the
next
a
parcel
;
and
Anne
had
not
been
there
half
an
*NL*
hour
,
when
their
dining-room
,
spacious
as
it
was
,
seemed
more
than
half
*NL*
filled
:
a
party
of
steady
old
friends
were
seated
around
Mrs
Musgrove
,
*NL*
and
Charles
came
back
with
Captains
Harville
and
Wentworth
.
The
*NL*
appearance
of
the
latter
could
not
be
more
than
the
surprise
of
the
*NL*
moment
.
It
was
impossible
for
her
to
have
forgotten
to
feel
that
this
*NL*
arrival
of
their
common
friends
must
be
soon
bringing
them
together
*NL*
again
.
Their
last
meeting
had
been
most
important
in
opening
his
*NL*
feelings
;
she
had
derived
from
it
a
delightful
conviction
;
but
she
*NL*
feared
from
his
looks
,
that
the
same
unfortunate
persuasion
,
which
had
*NL*
hastened
him
away
from
the
Concert
Room
,
still
governed
.
He
did
not
*NL*
seem
to
want
to
be
near
enough
for
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
be
calm
,
and
leave
things
to
take
their
course
,
and
tried
*NL*
to
dwell
much
on
this
argument
of
rational
dependence
:
--
``
Surely
,
if
*NL*
there
be
constant
attachment
on
each
side
,
our
hearts
must
understand
*NL*
each
other
ere
long
.
We
are
not
boy
and
girl
,
to
be
captiously
*NL*
irritable
,
misled
by
every
moment
's
inadvertence
,
and
wantonly
playing
*NL*
with
our
own
happiness
.
''
And
yet
,
a
few
minutes
afterwards
,
she
felt
*NL*
as
if
their
being
in
company
with
each
other
,
under
their
present
*NL*
circumstances
,
could
only
be
exposing
them
to
inadvertencies
and
*NL*
misconstructions
of
the
most
mischievous
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
''
cried
Mary
,
still
at
her
window
,
``
there
is
Mrs
Clay
,
I
am
sure
,
*NL*
standing
under
the
colonnade
,
and
a
gentleman
with
her
.
I
saw
them
*NL*
turn
the
corner
from
Bath
Street
just
now
.
They
seemed
deep
in
talk
.
*NL*
Who
is
it
?
Come
,
and
tell
me
.
Good
heavens
!
I
recollect
.
It
is
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
cried
Anne
,
quickly
,
``
it
can
not
be
Mr
Elliot
,
I
assure
you
.
He
*NL*
was
to
leave
Bath
at
nine
this
morning
,
and
does
not
come
back
till
*NL*
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
,
she
felt
that
Captain
Wentworth
was
looking
at
her
,
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
which
vexed
and
embarrassed
her
,
and
made
her
regret
*NL*
that
she
had
said
so
much
,
simple
as
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
,
resenting
that
she
should
be
supposed
not
to
know
her
own
cousin
,
*NL*
began
talking
very
warmly
about
the
family
features
,
and
protesting
*NL*
still
more
positively
that
it
was
Mr
Elliot
,
calling
again
upon
Anne
to
*NL*
come
and
look
for
herself
,
but
Anne
did
not
mean
to
stir
,
and
tried
to
*NL*
be
cool
and
unconcerned
.
Her
distress
returned
,
however
,
on
perceiving
*NL*
smiles
and
intelligent
glances
pass
between
two
or
three
of
the
lady
*NL*
visitors
,
as
if
they
believed
themselves
quite
in
the
secret
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
the
report
concerning
her
had
spread
,
and
a
short
pause
*NL*
succeeded
,
which
seemed
to
ensure
that
it
would
now
spread
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
come
,
Anne
,
''
cried
Mary
,
``
come
and
look
yourself
.
You
will
be
too
*NL*
late
if
you
do
not
make
haste
.
They
are
parting
;
they
are
shaking
*NL*
hands
.
He
is
turning
away
.
Not
know
Mr
Elliot
,
indeed
!
You
seem
to
*NL*
have
forgot
all
about
Lyme
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
pacify
Mary
,
and
perhaps
screen
her
own
embarrassment
,
Anne
did
move
*NL*
quietly
to
the
window
.
She
was
just
in
time
to
ascertain
that
it
*NL*
really
was
Mr
Elliot
,
which
she
had
never
believed
,
before
he
*NL*
disappeared
on
one
side
,
as
Mrs
Clay
walked
quickly
off
on
the
other
;
*NL*
and
checking
the
surprise
which
she
could
not
but
feel
at
such
an
*NL*
appearance
of
friendly
conference
between
two
persons
of
totally
*NL*
opposite
interest
,
she
calmly
said
,
``
Yes
,
it
is
Mr
Elliot
,
certainly
.
*NL*
He
has
changed
his
hour
of
going
,
I
suppose
,
that
is
all
,
or
I
may
be
*NL*
mistaken
,
I
might
not
attend
;
''
and
walked
back
to
her
chair
,
*NL*
recomposed
,
and
with
the
comfortable
hope
of
having
acquitted
herself
*NL*
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitors
took
their
leave
;
and
Charles
,
having
civilly
seen
them
*NL*
off
,
and
then
made
a
face
at
them
,
and
abused
them
for
coming
,
began
*NL*
with
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
mother
,
I
have
done
something
for
you
that
you
will
like
.
I
*NL*
have
been
to
the
theatre
,
and
secured
a
box
for
to-morrow
night
.
A
'n'
t
*NL*
I
a
good
boy
?
I
know
you
love
a
play
;
and
there
is
room
for
us
all
.
*NL*
It
holds
nine
.
I
have
engaged
Captain
Wentworth
.
Anne
will
not
be
*NL*
sorry
to
join
us
,
I
am
sure
.
We
all
like
a
play
.
Have
not
I
done
*NL*
well
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Musgrove
was
good
humouredly
beginning
to
express
her
perfect
*NL*
readiness
for
the
play
,
if
Henrietta
and
all
the
others
liked
it
,
when
*NL*
Mary
eagerly
interrupted
her
by
exclaiming
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
,
Charles
!
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
?
Take
a
box
*NL*
for
to-morrow
night
!
Have
you
forgot
that
we
are
engaged
to
Camden
*NL*
Place
to-morrow
night
?
and
that
we
were
most
particularly
asked
to
meet
*NL*
Lady
Dalrymple
and
her
daughter
,
and
Mr
Elliot
,
and
all
the
principal
*NL*
family
connexions
,
on
purpose
to
be
introduced
to
them
?
How
can
you
be
*NL*
so
forgetful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoo
!
phoo
!
''
replied
Charles
,
``
what
's
an
evening
party
?
Never
worth
*NL*
remembering
.
Your
father
might
have
asked
us
to
dinner
,
I
think
,
if
he
*NL*
had
wanted
to
see
us
.
You
may
do
as
you
like
,
but
I
shall
go
to
the
*NL*
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Charles
,
I
declare
it
will
be
too
abominable
if
you
do
,
when
you
*NL*
promised
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
not
promise
.
I
only
smirked
and
bowed
,
and
said
the
word
*NL*
`
happy
.
'
There
was
no
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
go
,
Charles
.
It
would
be
unpardonable
to
fail
.
We
were
*NL*
asked
on
purpose
to
be
introduced
.
There
was
always
such
a
great
*NL*
connexion
between
the
Dalrymples
and
ourselves
.
Nothing
ever
happened
*NL*
on
either
side
that
was
not
announced
immediately
.
We
are
quite
near
*NL*
relations
,
you
know
;
and
Mr
Elliot
too
,
whom
you
ought
so
particularly
*NL*
to
be
acquainted
with
!
Every
attention
is
due
to
Mr
Elliot
.
Consider
,
*NL*
my
father
's
heir
:
the
future
representative
of
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
to
me
about
heirs
and
representatives
,
''
cried
Charles
.
``
I
*NL*
am
not
one
of
those
who
neglect
the
reigning
power
to
bow
to
the
rising
*NL*
sun
.
If
I
would
not
go
for
the
sake
of
your
father
,
I
should
think
it
*NL*
scandalous
to
go
for
the
sake
of
his
heir
.
What
is
Mr
Elliot
to
me
?
''
*NL*
The
careless
expression
was
life
to
Anne
,
who
saw
that
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
was
all
attention
,
looking
and
listening
with
his
whole
soul
;
*NL*
and
that
the
last
words
brought
his
enquiring
eyes
from
Charles
to
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
and
Mary
still
talked
on
in
the
same
style
;
he
,
half
serious
*NL*
and
half
jesting
,
maintaining
the
scheme
for
the
play
,
and
she
,
*NL*
invariably
serious
,
most
warmly
opposing
it
,
and
not
omitting
to
make
*NL*
it
known
that
,
however
determined
to
go
to
Camden
Place
herself
,
she
*NL*
should
not
think
herself
very
well
used
,
if
they
went
to
the
play
*NL*
without
her
.
Mrs
Musgrove
interposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
better
put
it
off
.
Charles
,
you
had
much
better
go
back
and
*NL*
change
the
box
for
Tuesday
.
It
would
be
a
pity
to
be
divided
,
and
we
*NL*
should
be
losing
Miss
Anne
,
too
,
if
there
is
a
party
at
her
father
's
;
*NL*
and
I
am
sure
neither
Henrietta
nor
I
should
care
at
all
for
the
play
,
*NL*
if
Miss
Anne
could
not
be
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
felt
truly
obliged
to
her
for
such
kindness
;
and
quite
as
much
so
*NL*
for
the
opportunity
it
gave
her
of
decidedly
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
depended
only
on
my
inclination
,
ma'am
,
the
party
at
home
*NL*
-LRB-
excepting
on
Mary
's
account
-RRB-
would
not
be
the
smallest
impediment
.
I
*NL*
have
no
pleasure
in
the
sort
of
meeting
,
and
should
be
too
happy
to
*NL*
change
it
for
a
play
,
and
with
you
.
But
,
it
had
better
not
be
*NL*
attempted
,
perhaps
.
''
She
had
spoken
it
;
but
she
trembled
when
it
was
*NL*
done
,
conscious
that
her
words
were
listened
to
,
and
daring
not
even
to
*NL*
try
to
observe
their
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
soon
generally
agreed
that
Tuesday
should
be
the
day
;
Charles
*NL*
only
reserving
the
advantage
of
still
teasing
his
wife
,
by
persisting
*NL*
that
he
would
go
to
the
play
to-morrow
if
nobody
else
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
left
his
seat
,
and
walked
to
the
fire-place
;
probably
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
walking
away
from
it
soon
afterwards
,
and
taking
a
*NL*
station
,
with
less
bare-faced
design
,
by
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
been
long
enough
in
Bath
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
enjoy
the
evening
*NL*
parties
of
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
no
.
The
usual
character
of
them
has
nothing
for
me
.
I
am
no
*NL*
card-player
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
not
formerly
,
I
know
.
You
did
not
use
to
like
cards
;
but
*NL*
time
makes
many
changes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
yet
so
much
changed
,
''
cried
Anne
,
and
stopped
,
fearing
she
*NL*
hardly
knew
what
misconstruction
.
After
waiting
a
few
moments
he
said
,
*NL*
and
as
if
it
were
the
result
of
immediate
feeling
,
``
It
is
a
period
,
*NL*
indeed
!
Eight
years
and
a
half
is
a
period
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
he
would
have
proceeded
farther
was
left
to
Anne
's
imagination
*NL*
to
ponder
over
in
a
calmer
hour
;
for
while
still
hearing
the
sounds
he
*NL*
had
uttered
,
she
was
startled
to
other
subjects
by
Henrietta
,
eager
to
*NL*
make
use
of
the
present
leisure
for
getting
out
,
and
calling
on
her
*NL*
companions
to
lose
no
time
,
lest
somebody
else
should
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
obliged
to
move
.
Anne
talked
of
being
perfectly
ready
,
and
*NL*
tried
to
look
it
;
but
she
felt
that
could
Henrietta
have
known
the
*NL*
regret
and
reluctance
of
her
heart
in
quitting
that
chair
,
in
preparing
*NL*
to
quit
the
room
,
she
would
have
found
,
in
all
her
own
sensations
for
*NL*
her
cousin
,
in
the
very
security
of
his
affection
,
wherewith
to
pity
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
preparations
,
however
,
were
stopped
short
.
Alarming
sounds
were
*NL*
heard
;
other
visitors
approached
,
and
the
door
was
thrown
open
for
Sir
*NL*
Walter
and
Miss
Elliot
,
whose
entrance
seemed
to
give
a
general
chill
.
*NL*
Anne
felt
an
instant
oppression
,
and
wherever
she
looked
saw
symptoms
*NL*
of
the
same
.
The
comfort
,
the
freedom
,
the
gaiety
of
the
room
was
*NL*
over
,
hushed
into
cold
composure
,
determined
silence
,
or
insipid
talk
,
*NL*
to
meet
the
heartless
elegance
of
her
father
and
sister
.
How
*NL*
mortifying
to
feel
that
it
was
so
!
*NL*
*NL*
Her
jealous
eye
was
satisfied
in
one
particular
.
Captain
Wentworth
was
*NL*
acknowledged
again
by
each
,
by
Elizabeth
more
graciously
than
before
.
*NL*
She
even
addressed
him
once
,
and
looked
at
him
more
than
once
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
,
in
fact
,
revolving
a
great
measure
.
The
sequel
*NL*
explained
it
.
After
the
waste
of
a
few
minutes
in
saying
the
proper
*NL*
nothings
,
she
began
to
give
the
invitation
which
was
to
comprise
all
*NL*
the
remaining
dues
of
the
Musgroves
.
``
To-morrow
evening
,
to
meet
a
few
*NL*
friends
:
no
formal
party
.
''
It
was
all
said
very
gracefully
,
and
the
*NL*
cards
with
which
she
had
provided
herself
,
the
``
Miss
Elliot
at
home
,
''
*NL*
were
laid
on
the
table
,
with
a
courteous
,
comprehensive
smile
to
all
,
*NL*
and
one
smile
and
one
card
more
decidedly
for
Captain
Wentworth
.
The
*NL*
truth
was
,
that
Elizabeth
had
been
long
enough
in
Bath
to
understand
*NL*
the
importance
of
a
man
of
such
an
air
and
appearance
as
his
.
The
past
*NL*
was
nothing
.
The
present
was
that
Captain
Wentworth
would
move
about
*NL*
well
in
her
drawing-room
.
The
card
was
pointedly
given
,
and
Sir
Walter
*NL*
and
Elizabeth
arose
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interruption
had
been
short
,
though
severe
,
and
ease
and
animation
*NL*
returned
to
most
of
those
they
left
as
the
door
shut
them
out
,
but
not
*NL*
to
Anne
.
She
could
think
only
of
the
invitation
she
had
with
such
*NL*
astonishment
witnessed
,
and
of
the
manner
in
which
it
had
been
*NL*
received
;
a
manner
of
doubtful
meaning
,
of
surprise
rather
than
*NL*
gratification
,
of
polite
acknowledgement
rather
than
acceptance
.
She
*NL*
knew
him
;
she
saw
disdain
in
his
eye
,
and
could
not
venture
to
believe
*NL*
that
he
had
determined
to
accept
such
an
offering
,
as
an
atonement
for
*NL*
all
the
insolence
of
the
past
.
Her
spirits
sank
.
He
held
the
card
in
*NL*
his
hand
after
they
were
gone
,
as
if
deeply
considering
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
think
of
Elizabeth
's
including
everybody
!
''
whispered
Mary
very
*NL*
audibly
.
``
I
do
not
wonder
Captain
Wentworth
is
delighted
!
You
see
he
*NL*
can
not
put
the
card
out
of
his
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
caught
his
eye
,
saw
his
cheeks
glow
,
and
his
mouth
form
itself
*NL*
into
a
momentary
expression
of
contempt
,
and
turned
away
,
that
she
*NL*
might
neither
see
nor
hear
more
to
vex
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
separated
.
The
gentlemen
had
their
own
pursuits
,
the
ladies
*NL*
proceeded
on
their
own
business
,
and
they
met
no
more
while
Anne
*NL*
belonged
to
them
.
She
was
earnestly
begged
to
return
and
dine
,
and
*NL*
give
them
all
the
rest
of
the
day
,
but
her
spirits
had
been
so
long
*NL*
exerted
that
at
present
she
felt
unequal
to
more
,
and
fit
only
for
*NL*
home
,
where
she
might
be
sure
of
being
as
silent
as
she
chose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Promising
to
be
with
them
the
whole
of
the
following
morning
,
*NL*
therefore
,
she
closed
the
fatigues
of
the
present
by
a
toilsome
walk
to
*NL*
Camden
Place
,
there
to
spend
the
evening
chiefly
in
listening
to
the
*NL*
busy
arrangements
of
Elizabeth
and
Mrs
Clay
for
the
morrow
's
party
,
the
*NL*
frequent
enumeration
of
the
persons
invited
,
and
the
continually
*NL*
improving
detail
of
all
the
embellishments
which
were
to
make
it
the
*NL*
most
completely
elegant
of
its
kind
in
Bath
,
while
harassing
herself
*NL*
with
the
never-ending
question
,
of
whether
Captain
Wentworth
would
come
*NL*
or
not
?
They
were
reckoning
him
as
certain
,
but
with
her
it
was
a
*NL*
gnawing
solicitude
never
appeased
for
five
minutes
together
.
She
*NL*
generally
thought
he
would
come
,
because
she
generally
thought
he
*NL*
ought
;
but
it
was
a
case
which
she
could
not
so
shape
into
any
positive
*NL*
act
of
duty
or
discretion
,
as
inevitably
to
defy
the
suggestions
of
*NL*
very
opposite
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
only
roused
herself
from
the
broodings
of
this
restless
agitation
,
*NL*
to
let
Mrs
Clay
know
that
she
had
been
seen
with
Mr
Elliot
three
hours
*NL*
after
his
being
supposed
to
be
out
of
Bath
,
for
having
watched
in
vain
*NL*
for
some
intimation
of
the
interview
from
the
lady
herself
,
she
*NL*
determined
to
mention
it
,
and
it
seemed
to
her
there
was
guilt
in
Mrs
*NL*
Clay
's
face
as
she
listened
.
It
was
transient
:
cleared
away
in
an
*NL*
instant
;
but
Anne
could
imagine
she
read
there
the
consciousness
of
*NL*
having
,
by
some
complication
of
mutual
trick
,
or
some
overbearing
*NL*
authority
of
his
,
been
obliged
to
attend
-LRB-
perhaps
for
half
an
hour
-RRB-
to
*NL*
his
lectures
and
restrictions
on
her
designs
on
Sir
Walter
.
She
*NL*
exclaimed
,
however
,
with
a
very
tolerable
imitation
of
nature
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
dear
!
very
true
.
Only
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
to
my
great
surprise
I
*NL*
met
with
Mr
Elliot
in
Bath
Street
.
I
was
never
more
astonished
.
He
*NL*
turned
back
and
walked
with
me
to
the
Pump
Yard
.
He
had
been
prevented
*NL*
setting
off
for
Thornberry
,
but
I
really
forget
by
what
;
for
I
was
in
a
*NL*
hurry
,
and
could
not
much
attend
,
and
I
can
only
answer
for
his
being
*NL*
determined
not
to
be
delayed
in
his
return
.
He
wanted
to
know
how
*NL*
early
he
might
be
admitted
to-morrow
.
He
was
full
of
`
to-morrow
,
'
and
*NL*
it
is
very
evident
that
I
have
been
full
of
it
too
,
ever
since
I
*NL*
entered
the
house
,
and
learnt
the
extension
of
your
plan
and
all
that
*NL*
had
happened
,
or
my
seeing
him
could
never
have
gone
so
entirely
out
of
*NL*
my
head

Chapter
23
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
only
had
passed
since
Anne
's
conversation
with
Mrs
Smith
;
but
a
*NL*
keener
interest
had
succeeded
,
and
she
was
now
so
little
touched
by
Mr
*NL*
Elliot
's
conduct
,
except
by
its
effects
in
one
quarter
,
that
it
became
*NL*
a
matter
of
course
the
next
morning
,
still
to
defer
her
explanatory
*NL*
visit
in
Rivers
Street
.
She
had
promised
to
be
with
the
Musgroves
from
*NL*
breakfast
to
dinner
.
Her
faith
was
plighted
,
and
Mr
Elliot
's
*NL*
character
,
like
the
Sultaness
Scheherazade
's
head
,
must
live
another
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
keep
her
appointment
punctually
,
however
;
the
weather
was
*NL*
unfavourable
,
and
she
had
grieved
over
the
rain
on
her
friends
'
*NL*
account
,
and
felt
it
very
much
on
her
own
,
before
she
was
able
to
*NL*
attempt
the
walk
.
When
she
reached
the
White
Hart
,
and
made
her
way
to
*NL*
the
proper
apartment
,
she
found
herself
neither
arriving
quite
in
time
,
*NL*
nor
the
first
to
arrive
.
The
party
before
her
were
,
Mrs
Musgrove
,
*NL*
talking
to
Mrs
Croft
,
and
Captain
Harville
to
Captain
Wentworth
;
and
*NL*
she
immediately
heard
that
Mary
and
Henrietta
,
too
impatient
to
wait
,
*NL*
had
gone
out
the
moment
it
had
cleared
,
but
would
be
back
again
soon
,
*NL*
and
that
the
strictest
injunctions
had
been
left
with
Mrs
Musgrove
to
*NL*
keep
her
there
till
they
returned
.
She
had
only
to
submit
,
sit
down
,
*NL*
be
outwardly
composed
,
and
feel
herself
plunged
at
once
in
all
the
*NL*
agitations
which
she
had
merely
laid
her
account
of
tasting
a
little
*NL*
before
the
morning
closed
.
There
was
no
delay
,
no
waste
of
time
.
She
*NL*
was
deep
in
the
happiness
of
such
misery
,
or
the
misery
of
such
*NL*
happiness
,
instantly
.
Two
minutes
after
her
entering
the
room
,
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
write
the
letter
we
were
talking
of
,
Harville
,
now
,
if
you
*NL*
will
give
me
materials
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Materials
were
at
hand
,
on
a
separate
table
;
he
went
to
it
,
and
nearly
*NL*
turning
his
back
to
them
all
,
was
engrossed
by
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Musgrove
was
giving
Mrs
Croft
the
history
of
her
eldest
daughter
's
*NL*
engagement
,
and
just
in
that
inconvenient
tone
of
voice
which
was
*NL*
perfectly
audible
while
it
pretended
to
be
a
whisper
.
Anne
felt
that
*NL*
she
did
not
belong
to
the
conversation
,
and
yet
,
as
Captain
Harville
*NL*
seemed
thoughtful
and
not
disposed
to
talk
,
she
could
not
avoid
hearing
*NL*
many
undesirable
particulars
;
such
as
,
``
how
Mr
Musgrove
and
my
brother
*NL*
Hayter
had
met
again
and
again
to
talk
it
over
;
what
my
brother
Hayter
*NL*
had
said
one
day
,
and
what
Mr
Musgrove
had
proposed
the
next
,
and
what
*NL*
had
occurred
to
my
sister
Hayter
,
and
what
the
young
people
had
wished
,
*NL*
and
what
I
said
at
first
I
never
could
consent
to
,
but
was
afterwards
*NL*
persuaded
to
think
might
do
very
well
,
''
and
a
great
deal
in
the
same
*NL*
style
of
open-hearted
communication
:
minutiae
which
,
even
with
every
*NL*
advantage
of
taste
and
delicacy
,
which
good
Mrs
Musgrove
could
not
*NL*
give
,
could
be
properly
interesting
only
to
the
principals
.
Mrs
Croft
*NL*
was
attending
with
great
good-humour
,
and
whenever
she
spoke
at
all
,
it
*NL*
was
very
sensibly
.
Anne
hoped
the
gentlemen
might
each
be
too
much
*NL*
self-occupied
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
ma'am
,
all
these
thing
considered
,
''
said
Mrs
Musgrove
,
in
her
*NL*
powerful
whisper
,
``
though
we
could
have
wished
it
different
,
yet
,
*NL*
altogether
,
we
did
not
think
it
fair
to
stand
out
any
longer
,
for
*NL*
Charles
Hayter
was
quite
wild
about
it
,
and
Henrietta
was
pretty
near
*NL*
as
bad
;
and
so
we
thought
they
had
better
marry
at
once
,
and
make
the
*NL*
best
of
it
,
as
many
others
have
done
before
them
.
At
any
rate
,
said
I
,
*NL*
it
will
be
better
than
a
long
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
precisely
what
I
was
going
to
observe
,
''
cried
Mrs
Croft
.
``
I
*NL*
would
rather
have
young
people
settle
on
a
small
income
at
once
,
and
*NL*
have
to
struggle
with
a
few
difficulties
together
,
than
be
involved
in
*NL*
a
long
engagement
.
I
always
think
that
no
mutual
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
dear
Mrs
Croft
,
''
cried
Mrs
Musgrove
,
unable
to
let
her
finish
her
*NL*
speech
,
``
there
is
nothing
I
so
abominate
for
young
people
as
a
long
*NL*
engagement
.
It
is
what
I
always
protested
against
for
my
children
.
It
*NL*
is
all
very
well
,
I
used
to
say
,
for
young
people
to
be
engaged
,
if
*NL*
there
is
a
certainty
of
their
being
able
to
marry
in
six
months
,
or
*NL*
even
in
twelve
;
but
a
long
engagement
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
ma'am
,
''
said
Mrs
Croft
,
``
or
an
uncertain
engagement
,
an
*NL*
engagement
which
may
be
long
.
To
begin
without
knowing
that
at
such
a
*NL*
time
there
will
be
the
means
of
marrying
,
I
hold
to
be
very
unsafe
and
*NL*
unwise
,
and
what
I
think
all
parents
should
prevent
as
far
as
they
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
found
an
unexpected
interest
here
.
She
felt
its
application
to
*NL*
herself
,
felt
it
in
a
nervous
thrill
all
over
her
;
and
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
that
her
eyes
instinctively
glanced
towards
the
distant
table
,
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
's
pen
ceased
to
move
,
his
head
was
raised
,
pausing
,
*NL*
listening
,
and
he
turned
round
the
next
instant
to
give
a
look
,
one
*NL*
quick
,
conscious
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
ladies
continued
to
talk
,
to
re-urge
the
same
admitted
truths
,
*NL*
and
enforce
them
with
such
examples
of
the
ill
effect
of
a
contrary
*NL*
practice
as
had
fallen
within
their
observation
,
but
Anne
heard
nothing
*NL*
distinctly
;
it
was
only
a
buzz
of
words
in
her
ear
,
her
mind
was
in
*NL*
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Harville
,
who
had
in
truth
been
hearing
none
of
it
,
now
left
*NL*
his
seat
,
and
moved
to
a
window
,
and
Anne
seeming
to
watch
him
,
though
*NL*
it
was
from
thorough
absence
of
mind
,
became
gradually
sensible
that
he
*NL*
was
inviting
her
to
join
him
where
he
stood
.
He
looked
at
her
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
and
a
little
motion
of
the
head
,
which
expressed
,
``
Come
to
me
,
I
*NL*
have
something
to
say
;
''
and
the
unaffected
,
easy
kindness
of
manner
*NL*
which
denoted
the
feelings
of
an
older
acquaintance
than
he
really
was
,
*NL*
strongly
enforced
the
invitation
.
She
roused
herself
and
went
to
him
.
*NL*
The
window
at
which
he
stood
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
from
*NL*
where
the
two
ladies
were
sitting
,
and
though
nearer
to
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
's
table
,
not
very
near
.
As
she
joined
him
,
Captain
*NL*
Harville
's
countenance
re-assumed
the
serious
,
thoughtful
expression
*NL*
which
seemed
its
natural
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
''
said
he
,
unfolding
a
parcel
in
his
hand
,
and
displaying
a
*NL*
small
miniature
painting
,
``
do
you
know
who
that
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

Captain
Benwick

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

you
may
guess
who

deep
tone

you

little

was

And
with
a
*NL*
quivering
lip
he
wound
up
the
whole
by
adding
,
``
Poor

she

*NL*
not
have
forgotten
him
so
soon

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

replied
Anne
,
in
a
low

feeling
voice

``
That
I
can
easily

believe

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not

She
doted
on
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Harville
smiled
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
Do
you
claim
that
for
your
*NL*
sex
?
''
and
she
answered
the
question
,
smiling
also
,
``
Yes
.
We
certainly
*NL*
do
not
forget
you
as
soon
as
you
forget
us

It
is
,
perhaps
,
our
fate
*NL*
rather
than
our
merit
.
We
can
not
help
ourselves
.
We
live
at
home
,
*NL*
quiet
,
confined
,
and
our
feelings
prey
upon
us

You
are
forced
on

exertion

You
have
always
a
profession
,
pursuits
,
business
of
some
*NL*
sort
or
other
,
to
take
you
back
into
the
world
immediately

*NL*
continual
occupation

change
soon
weaken
impressions

*NL*
*NL*
``
Granting
your
assertion

the

does
all
this

soon

however

I
do
not

He

not

The
peace
turned
*NL*
him
on
shore
at

he

*NL*
``
True

``
very
true

I
did
not

Captain

If
the
change

not
from
outward

it
must
be
from
within

it
must
be
nature

Captain

*NL*
*NL*

No

no

I

nature
than
woman

to
be
inconstant
and
forget
those
they
do
love

or
*NL*
have
loved

I
believe
the
reverse
.
I
believe
in
a
true
analogy
*NL*
between
our
bodily
frames
and
our
mental
;
and
that
as
our
bodies
are
*NL*
the
strongest

so
are
our

out
the

weather

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

may
be
the

replied
Anne
,
``
but
the

*NL*
spirit
of

authorise
me

Man
is
more
robust

he

exactly
explains
my

Nay

it

Captain
Harville
was
*NL*
beginning
to
say
,
when
a
slight
noise
called
their
attention
to
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
's
hitherto
perfectly
quiet
division
of
the
room
.
It
was
*NL*
nothing
more
than
that
his
pen
had
fallen
down
;
but
Anne
was
startled
*NL*
at
finding
him
nearer
than
she
had
supposed
,
and
half
inclined
to
*NL*
suspect
that
the
pen
had
only
fallen
because
he
had
been
occupied
by
*NL*
them
,
striving
to
catch
sounds
,
which
yet
she
did
not
think
he
could
*NL*
have
caught
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Captain

*NL*
*NL*
``

-LRB-
smiling
at
Anne
,
-RRB-
``

*NL*
-LRB-
lowering
his

,
-RRB-
``
as
I

No

But
let
me
*NL*
observe
that
all
histories
are
against
you

all

If
I

such
a

I
could
bring

fifty

quotations
in

I
do
not

I

Yes

*NL*
``
We

We

It

a
difference
of
opinion

does
not
admit

*NL*
We
each
begin
,
probably
,
with
a
little
bias

upon

*NL*
``
Ah

Captain

,
in
a
tone
of
strong
feeling

``
if
I

make
you
comprehend

suffers
when
he
takes
a
last
look

his
wife
and
children
,
and
watches
the
boat
that
he
has
sent
them
off
*NL*
in
,
as
long
as
it
is
in
sight
,
and
then
turns
away
and
says
,
`
God

whether

ever
meet
again

And
then
,
if
I
could
convey
to
you
the

glow

his
soul
when
he
does
see

again

when

coming
back
after
a
*NL*
twelvemonth
's
absence
,
perhaps
,
and
obliged
to
put
into
another
port

*NL*
he
calculates
how
soon
it
be

his
own
with
emotion

*NL*
``

She
could
not

have
uttered
another

heart
was

full

much
oppressed

Captain

folding
up

Mrs
Croft
left
them
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
having
sealed
his
letter
*NL*
with
great
rapidity
,
was
indeed
ready
,
and
had
even
a
hurried
,
agitated
*NL*
air
,
which
shewed
impatience
to
be
gone
.
Anne
knew
not
how
to
*NL*
understand
it
.
She
had
the
kindest
``
Good
morning
,
God
bless
you
!
''
from
*NL*
Captain
Harville
,
but
from
him
not
a
word
,
nor
a
look
!
He
had
passed
*NL*
out
of
the
room
without
a
look
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
only
time
,
however
,
to
move
closer
to
the
table
where
he
had
*NL*
been
writing
,
when
footsteps
were
heard
returning
;
the
door
opened
,
it
*NL*
was
himself
.
He
begged
their
pardon
,
but
he
had
forgotten
his
gloves
,
*NL*
and
instantly
crossing
the
room
to
the
writing
table
,
he
drew
out
a
*NL*
letter
from
under
the
scattered
paper
,
placed
it
before
Anne
with
eyes
*NL*
of
glowing
entreaty
fixed
on
her
for
a
time
,
and
hastily
collecting
his
*NL*
gloves
,
was
again
out
of
the
room
,
almost
before
Mrs
Musgrove
was
aware
*NL*
of
his
being
in
it
:
the
work
of
an
instant
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
revolution
which
one
instant
had
made
in
Anne
,
was
almost
beyond
*NL*
expression
.
The
letter
,
with
a
direction
hardly
legible
,
to
``
Miss
A.
*NL*
E.
--
,
''
was
evidently
the
one
which
he
had
been
folding
so
hastily
.
*NL*
While
supposed
to
be
writing
only
to
Captain
Benwick
,
he
had
been
also
*NL*
addressing
her
!
On
the
contents
of
that
letter
depended
all
which
this
*NL*
world
could
do
for
her
.
Anything
was
possible
,
anything
might
be
*NL*
defied
rather
than
suspense
.
Mrs
Musgrove
had
little
arrangements
of
*NL*
her
own
at
her
own
table
;
to
their
protection
she
must
trust
,
and
*NL*
sinking
into
the
chair
which
he
had
occupied
,
succeeding
to
the
very
*NL*
spot
where
he
had
leaned
and
written
,
her
eyes
devoured
the
following
*NL*
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
listen
no
longer
in
silence
.
I
must
speak
to
you
by
such
means
*NL*
as
are
within
my
reach
.
You
pierce
my
soul
.
I
am
half
agony
,
half
*NL*
hope
.
Tell
me
not
that
I
am
too
late
,
that
such
precious
feelings
are
*NL*
gone
for
ever
.
I
offer
myself
to
you
again
with
a
heart
even
more
your
*NL*
own
than
when
you
almost
broke
it
,
eight
years
and
a
half
ago
.
Dare
*NL*
not
say
that
man
forgets
sooner
than
woman
,
that
his
love
has
an
*NL*
earlier
death
.
I
have
loved
none
but
you
.
Unjust
I
may
have
been
,
*NL*
weak
and
resentful
I
have
been
,
but
never
inconstant
.
You
alone
have
*NL*
brought
me
to
Bath
.
For
you
alone
,
I
think
and
plan
.
Have
you
not
*NL*
seen
this
?
Can
you
fail
to
have
understood
my
wishes
?
I
had
not
*NL*
waited
even
these
ten
days
,
could
I
have
read
your
feelings
,
as
I
think
*NL*
you
must
have
penetrated
mine
.
I
can
hardly
write
.
I
am
every
instant
*NL*
hearing
something
which
overpowers
me
.
You
sink
your
voice
,
but
I
can
*NL*
distinguish
the
tones
of
that
voice
when
they
would
be
lost
on
others
.
*NL*
Too
good
,
too
excellent
creature
!
You
do
us
justice
,
indeed
.
You
do
*NL*
believe
that
there
is
true
attachment
and
constancy
among
men
.
Believe
*NL*
it
to
be
most
fervent
,
most
undeviating
,
in
F.
W.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
,
uncertain
of
my
fate
;
but
I
shall
return
hither
,
or
follow
*NL*
your
party
,
as
soon
as
possible
.
A
word
,
a
look
,
will
be
enough
to
*NL*
decide
whether
I
enter
your
father
's
house
this
evening
or
never

Such
a
letter
was
not
to
be
soon
recovered
from
.
Half
an
hour
's
*NL*
solitude
and
reflection
might
have
tranquillized
her
;
but
the
ten
*NL*
minutes
only
which
now
passed
before
she
was
interrupted
,
with
all
the
*NL*
restraints
of
her
situation
,
could
do
nothing
towards
tranquillity
.
*NL*
Every
moment
rather
brought
fresh
agitation
.
It
was
overpowering
*NL*
happiness
.
And
before
she
was
beyond
the
first
stage
of
full
*NL*
sensation
,
Charles
,
Mary
,
and
Henrietta
all
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
absolute
necessity
of
seeming
like
herself
produced
then
an
*NL*
immediate
struggle
;
but
after
a
while
she
could
do
no
more
.
She
began
*NL*
not
to
understand
a
word
they
said
,
and
was
obliged
to
plead
*NL*
indisposition
and
excuse
herself
.
They
could
then
see
that
she
looked
*NL*
very
ill
,
were
shocked
and
concerned
,
and
would
not
stir
without
her
*NL*
for
the
world
.
This
was
dreadful
.
Would
they
only
have
gone
away
,
and
*NL*
left
her
in
the
quiet
possession
of
that
room
it
would
have
been
her
*NL*
cure
;
but
to
have
them
all
standing
or
waiting
around
her
was
*NL*
distracting
,
and
in
desperation
,
she
said
she
would
go
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
my
dear
,
''
cried
Mrs
Musgrove
,
``
go
home
directly
,
and
*NL*
take
care
of
yourself
,
that
you
may
be
fit
for
the
evening
.
I
wish
*NL*
Sarah
was
here
to
doctor
you
,
but
I
am
no
doctor
myself
.
Charles
,
ring
*NL*
and
order
a
chair
.
She
must
not
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
chair
would
never
do
.
Worse
than
all
!
To
lose
the
possibility
*NL*
of
speaking
two
words
to
Captain
Wentworth
in
the
course
of
her
quiet
,
*NL*
solitary
progress
up
the
town
-LRB-
and
she
felt
almost
certain
of
meeting
*NL*
him
-RRB-
could
not
be
borne
.
The
chair
was
earnestly
protested
against
,
*NL*
and
Mrs
Musgrove
,
who
thought
only
of
one
sort
of
illness
,
having
*NL*
assured
herself
with
some
anxiety
,
that
there
had
been
no
fall
in
the
*NL*
case
;
that
Anne
had
not
at
any
time
lately
slipped
down
,
and
got
a
blow
*NL*
on
her
head
;
that
she
was
perfectly
convinced
of
having
had
no
fall
;
*NL*
could
part
with
her
cheerfully
,
and
depend
on
finding
her
better
at
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anxious
to
omit
no
possible
precaution
,
Anne
struggled
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
ma'am
,
that
it
is
not
perfectly
understood
.
Pray
be
so
*NL*
good
as
to
mention
to
the
other
gentlemen
that
we
hope
to
see
your
*NL*
whole
party
this
evening
.
I
am
afraid
there
had
been
some
mistake
;
and
*NL*
I
wish
you
particularly
to
assure
Captain
Harville
and
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
,
that
we
hope
to
see
them
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
my
dear
,
it
is
quite
understood
,
I
give
you
my
word
.
Captain
*NL*
Harville
has
no
thought
but
of
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
But
I
am
afraid
;
and
I
should
be
so
very
sorry
.
*NL*
Will
you
promise
me
to
mention
it
,
when
you
see
them
again
?
You
will
*NL*
see
them
both
this
morning
,
I
dare
say
.
Do
promise
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
I
will
,
if
you
wish
it
.
Charles
,
if
you
see
Captain
*NL*
Harville
anywhere
,
remember
to
give
Miss
Anne
's
message
.
But
indeed
,
*NL*
my
dear
,
you
need
not
be
uneasy
.
Captain
Harville
holds
himself
quite
*NL*
engaged
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
the
same
,
I
dare
*NL*
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
could
do
no
more
;
but
her
heart
prophesied
some
mischance
to
damp
*NL*
the
perfection
of
her
felicity
.
It
could
not
be
very
lasting
,
however
.
*NL*
Even
if
he
did
not
come
to
Camden
Place
himself
,
it
would
be
in
her
*NL*
power
to
send
an
intelligible
sentence
by
Captain
Harville
.
Another
*NL*
momentary
vexation
occurred
.
Charles
,
in
his
real
concern
and
good
*NL*
nature
,
would
go
home
with
her
;
there
was
no
preventing
him
.
This
was
*NL*
almost
cruel
.
But
she
could
not
be
long
ungrateful
;
he
was
sacrificing
*NL*
an
engagement
at
a
gunsmith
's
,
to
be
of
use
to
her
;
and
she
set
off
*NL*
with
him
,
with
no
feeling
but
gratitude
apparent
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
on
Union
Street
,
when
a
quicker
step
behind
,
a
something
of
*NL*
familiar
sound
,
gave
her
two
moments
'
preparation
for
the
sight
of
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
.
He
joined
them
;
but
,
as
if
irresolute
whether
to
*NL*
join
or
to
pass
on
,
said
nothing
,
only
looked
.
Anne
could
command
*NL*
herself
enough
to
receive
that
look
,
and
not
repulsively
.
The
cheeks
*NL*
which
had
been
pale
now
glowed
,
and
the
movements
which
had
hesitated
*NL*
were
decided
.
He
walked
by
her
side
.
Presently
,
struck
by
a
sudden
*NL*
thought
,
Charles
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Wentworth
,
which
way
are
you
going
?
Only
to
Gay
Street
,
or
*NL*
farther
up
the
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
know
,
''
replied
Captain
Wentworth
,
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
as
high
as
Belmont
?
Are
you
going
near
Camden
Place
?
*NL*
Because
,
if
you
are
,
I
shall
have
no
scruple
in
asking
you
to
take
my
*NL*
place
,
and
give
Anne
your
arm
to
her
father
's
door
.
She
is
rather
done
*NL*
for
this
morning
,
and
must
not
go
so
far
without
help
,
and
I
ought
to
*NL*
be
at
that
fellow
's
in
the
Market
Place
.
He
promised
me
the
sight
of
a
*NL*
capital
gun
he
is
just
going
to
send
off
;
said
he
would
keep
it
*NL*
unpacked
to
the
last
possible
moment
,
that
I
might
see
it
;
and
if
I
do
*NL*
not
turn
back
now
,
I
have
no
chance
.
By
his
description
,
a
good
deal
*NL*
like
the
second
size
double-barrel
of
mine
,
which
you
shot
with
one
day
*NL*
round
Winthrop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
could
not
be
an
objection
.
There
could
be
only
the
most
proper
*NL*
alacrity
,
a
most
obliging
compliance
for
public
view
;
and
smiles
reined
*NL*
in
and
spirits
dancing
in
private
rapture
.
In
half
a
minute
Charles
*NL*
was
at
the
bottom
of
Union
Street
again
,
and
the
other
two
proceeding
*NL*
together
:
and
soon
words
enough
had
passed
between
them
to
decide
*NL*
their
direction
towards
the
comparatively
quiet
and
retired
gravel
*NL*
walk
,
where
the
power
of
conversation
would
make
the
present
hour
a
*NL*
blessing
indeed
,
and
prepare
it
for
all
the
immortality
which
the
*NL*
happiest
recollections
of
their
own
future
lives
could
bestow
.
There
*NL*
they
exchanged
again
those
feelings
and
those
promises
which
had
once
*NL*
before
seemed
to
secure
everything
,
but
which
had
been
followed
by
so
*NL*
many
,
many
years
of
division
and
estrangement
.
There
they
returned
*NL*
again
into
the
past
,
more
exquisitely
happy
,
perhaps
,
in
their
*NL*
re-union
,
than
when
it
had
been
first
projected
;
more
tender
,
more
*NL*
tried
,
more
fixed
in
a
knowledge
of
each
other
's
character
,
truth
,
and
*NL*
attachment
;
more
equal
to
act
,
more
justified
in
acting
.
And
there
,
as
*NL*
they
slowly
paced
the
gradual
ascent
,
heedless
of
every
group
around
*NL*
them
,
seeing
neither
sauntering
politicians
,
bustling
housekeepers
,
*NL*
flirting
girls
,
nor
nursery-maids
and
children
,
they
could
indulge
in
*NL*
those
retrospections
and
acknowledgements
,
and
especially
in
those
*NL*
explanations
of
what
had
directly
preceded
the
present
moment
,
which
*NL*
were
so
poignant
and
so
ceaseless
in
interest
.
All
the
little
*NL*
variations
of
the
last
week
were
gone
through
;
and
of
yesterday
and
*NL*
today
there
could
scarcely
be
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
mistaken
him
.
Jealousy
of
Mr
Elliot
had
been
the
retarding
*NL*
weight
,
the
doubt
,
the
torment
.
That
had
begun
to
operate
in
the
very
*NL*
hour
of
first
meeting
her
in
Bath
;
that
had
returned
,
after
a
short
*NL*
suspension
,
to
ruin
the
concert
;
and
that
had
influenced
him
in
*NL*
everything
he
had
said
and
done
,
or
omitted
to
say
and
do
,
in
the
last
*NL*
four-and-twenty
hours
.
It
had
been
gradually
yielding
to
the
better
*NL*
hopes
which
her
looks
,
or
words
,
or
actions
occasionally
encouraged
;
it
*NL*
had
been
vanquished
at
last
by
those
sentiments
and
those
tones
which
*NL*
had
reached
him
while
she
talked
with
Captain
Harville
;
and
under
the
*NL*
irresistible
governance
of
which
he
had
seized
a
sheet
of
paper
,
and
*NL*
poured
out
his
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
what
he
had
then
written
,
nothing
was
to
be
retracted
or
qualified
.
*NL*
He
persisted
in
having
loved
none
but
her
.
She
had
never
been
*NL*
supplanted
.
He
never
even
believed
himself
to
see
her
equal
.
Thus
*NL*
much
indeed
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
:
that
he
had
been
constant
*NL*
unconsciously
,
nay
unintentionally
;
that
he
had
meant
to
forget
her
,
*NL*
and
believed
it
to
be
done
.
He
had
imagined
himself
indifferent
,
when
*NL*
he
had
only
been
angry
;
and
he
had
been
unjust
to
her
merits
,
because
*NL*
he
had
been
a
sufferer
from
them
.
Her
character
was
now
fixed
on
his
*NL*
mind
as
perfection
itself
,
maintaining
the
loveliest
medium
of
*NL*
fortitude
and
gentleness
;
but
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
only
*NL*
at
Uppercross
had
he
learnt
to
do
her
justice
,
and
only
at
Lyme
had
he
*NL*
begun
to
understand
himself
.
At
Lyme
,
he
had
received
lessons
of
more
*NL*
than
one
sort
.
The
passing
admiration
of
Mr
Elliot
had
at
least
roused
*NL*
him
,
and
the
scenes
on
the
Cobb
and
at
Captain
Harville
's
had
fixed
her
*NL*
superiority
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
preceding
attempts
to
attach
himself
to
Louisa
Musgrove
-LRB-
the
*NL*
attempts
of
angry
pride
-RRB-
,
he
protested
that
he
had
for
ever
felt
it
to
*NL*
be
impossible
;
that
he
had
not
cared
,
could
not
care
,
for
Louisa
;
*NL*
though
till
that
day
,
till
the
leisure
for
reflection
which
followed
*NL*
it
,
he
had
not
understood
the
perfect
excellence
of
the
mind
with
which
*NL*
Louisa
's
could
so
ill
bear
a
comparison
,
or
the
perfect
unrivalled
hold
*NL*
it
possessed
over
his
own
.
There
,
he
had
learnt
to
distinguish
between
*NL*
the
steadiness
of
principle
and
the
obstinacy
of
self-will
,
between
the
*NL*
darings
of
heedlessness
and
the
resolution
of
a
collected
mind
.
There
*NL*
he
had
seen
everything
to
exalt
in
his
estimation
the
woman
he
had
*NL*
lost
;
and
there
begun
to
deplore
the
pride
,
the
folly
,
the
madness
of
*NL*
resentment
,
which
had
kept
him
from
trying
to
regain
her
when
thrown
in
*NL*
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
period
his
penance
had
become
severe
.
He
had
no
sooner
been
*NL*
free
from
the
horror
and
remorse
attending
the
first
few
days
of
*NL*
Louisa
's
accident
,
no
sooner
begun
to
feel
himself
alive
again
,
than
he
*NL*
had
begun
to
feel
himself
,
though
alive
,
not
at
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
I
was
considered
by
Harville
an
engaged
man
!
*NL*
That
neither
Harville
nor
his
wife
entertained
a
doubt
of
our
mutual
*NL*
attachment
.
I
was
startled
and
shocked
.
To
a
degree
,
I
could
*NL*
contradict
this
instantly
;
but
,
when
I
began
to
reflect
that
others
*NL*
might
have
felt
the
same
--
her
own
family
,
nay
,
perhaps
herself
--
I
was
*NL*
no
longer
at
my
own
disposal
.
I
was
hers
in
honour
if
she
wished
it
.
*NL*
I
had
been
unguarded
.
I
had
not
thought
seriously
on
this
subject
*NL*
before
.
I
had
not
considered
that
my
excessive
intimacy
must
have
its
*NL*
danger
of
ill
consequence
in
many
ways
;
and
that
I
had
no
right
to
be
*NL*
trying
whether
I
could
attach
myself
to
either
of
the
girls
,
at
the
*NL*
risk
of
raising
even
an
unpleasant
report
,
were
there
no
other
ill
*NL*
effects
.
I
had
been
grossly
wrong
,
and
must
abide
the
consequences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
too
late
,
in
short
,
that
he
had
entangled
himself
;
and
that
*NL*
precisely
as
he
became
fully
satisfied
of
his
not
caring
for
Louisa
at
*NL*
all
,
he
must
regard
himself
as
bound
to
her
,
if
her
sentiments
for
him
*NL*
were
what
the
Harvilles
supposed
.
It
determined
him
to
leave
Lyme
,
and
*NL*
await
her
complete
recovery
elsewhere
.
He
would
gladly
weaken
,
by
any
*NL*
fair
means
,
whatever
feelings
or
speculations
concerning
him
might
*NL*
exist
;
and
he
went
,
therefore
,
to
his
brother
's
,
meaning
after
a
while
*NL*
to
return
to
Kellynch
,
and
act
as
circumstances
might
require
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
six
weeks
with
Edward
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
saw
him
happy
.
I
could
*NL*
have
no
other
pleasure
.
I
deserved
none
.
He
enquired
after
you
very
*NL*
particularly
;
asked
even
if
you
were
personally
altered
,
little
*NL*
suspecting
that
to
my
eye
you
could
never
alter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
smiled
,
and
let
it
pass
.
It
was
too
pleasing
a
blunder
for
a
*NL*
reproach
.
It
is
something
for
a
woman
to
be
assured
,
in
her
*NL*
eight-and-twentieth
year
,
that
she
has
not
lost
one
charm
of
earlier
*NL*
youth
;
but
the
value
of
such
homage
was
inexpressibly
increased
to
*NL*
Anne
,
by
comparing
it
with
former
words
,
and
feeling
it
to
be
the
*NL*
result
,
not
the
cause
of
a
revival
of
his
warm
attachment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
remained
in
Shropshire
,
lamenting
the
blindness
of
his
own
*NL*
pride
,
and
the
blunders
of
his
own
calculations
,
till
at
once
released
*NL*
from
Louisa
by
the
astonishing
and
felicitous
intelligence
of
her
*NL*
engagement
with
Benwick
.

said
he

``
ended
the
worst
of
my
state
;
for
now
I
could
at
least
*NL*
put
myself
in
the
way
of
happiness
;
I
could
exert
myself
;
I
could
do
*NL*
something
.
But
to
be
waiting
so
long
in
inaction
,
and
waiting
only
for
*NL*
evil
,
had
been
dreadful
.
Within
the
first
five
minutes
I
said
,
'
I
will
*NL*
be
at
Bath
on
Wednesday
,
'
and
I
was
.
Was
it
unpardonable
to
think
it
*NL*
worth
my
while
to
come
?
and
to
arrive
with
some
degree
of
hope
?
You
*NL*
were
single
.
It
was
possible
that
you
might
retain
the
feelings
of
the
*NL*
past
,
as
I
did
;
and
one
encouragement
happened
to
be
mine
.
I
could
*NL*
never
doubt
that
you
would
be
loved
and
sought
by
others
,
but
I
knew
to
*NL*
a
certainty
that
you
had
refused
one
man
,
at
least
,
of
better
*NL*
pretensions
than
myself
;
and
I
could
not
help
often
saying
,
`
Was
this
*NL*
for
me
?

*NL*
*NL*
Their
first
meeting
in
Milsom
Street
afforded
much
to
be
said
,
but
the
*NL*
concert
still
more
.
That
evening
seemed
to
be
made
up
of
exquisite
*NL*
moments
.
The
moment
of
her
stepping
forward
in
the
Octagon
Room
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
:
the
moment
of
Mr
Elliot
's
appearing
and
tearing
her
*NL*
away
,
and
one
or
two
subsequent
moments
,
marked
by
returning
hope
or
*NL*
increasing
despondency
,
were
dwelt
on
with
energy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
you
,
''
cried
he
,
``
in
the
midst
of
those
who
could
not
be
my
*NL*
well-wishers
;
to
see
your
cousin
close
by
you
,
conversing
and
smiling
,
*NL*
and
feel
all
the
horrible
eligibilities
and
proprieties
of
the
match
!
*NL*
To
consider
it
as
the
certain
wish
of
every
being
who
could
hope
to
*NL*
influence
you
!
Even
if
your
own
feelings
were
reluctant
or
*NL*
indifferent
,
to
consider
what
powerful
supports
would
be
his
!
Was
it
*NL*
not
enough
to
make
the
fool
of
me
which
I
appeared
?
How
could
I
look
*NL*
on
without
agony
?
Was
not
the
very
sight
of
the
friend
who
sat
behind
*NL*
you
,
was
not
the
recollection
of
what
had
been
,
the
knowledge
of
her
*NL*
influence
,
the
indelible
,
immoveable
impression
of
what
persuasion
had
*NL*
once
done
--
was
it
not
all
against
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
distinguished
,
''
replied
Anne
.
``
You
should
not
have
*NL*
suspected
me
now
;
the
case
is
so
different
,
and
my
age
is
so
different
.
*NL*
If
I
was
wrong
in
yielding
to
persuasion
once
,
remember
that
it
was
to
*NL*
persuasion
exerted
on
the
side
of
safety
,
not
of
risk
.
When
I
yielded
,
*NL*
I
thought
it
was
to
duty
,
but
no
duty
could
be
called
in
aid
here
.
In
*NL*
marrying
a
man
indifferent
to
me
,
all
risk
would
have
been
incurred
,
*NL*
and
all
duty
violated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
ought
to
have
reasoned
thus
,
''
he
replied
,
``
but
I
could
not
.
*NL*
I
could
not
derive
benefit
from
the
late
knowledge
I
had
acquired
of
*NL*
your
character
.
I
could
not
bring
it
into
play
;
it
was
overwhelmed
,
*NL*
buried
,
lost
in
those
earlier
feelings
which
I
had
been
smarting
under
*NL*
year
after
year
.
I
could
think
of
you
only
as
one
who
had
yielded
,
who
*NL*
had
given
me
up
,
who
had
been
influenced
by
any
one
rather
than
by
me
.
*NL*
I
saw
you
with
the
very
person
who
had
guided
you
in
that
year
of
*NL*
misery
.
I
had
no
reason
to
believe
her
of
less
authority
now
.
The
*NL*
force
of
habit
was
to
be
added
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
thought
,
''
said
Anne
,
``
that
my
manner
to
yourself
might
*NL*
have
spared
you
much
or
all
of
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
your
manner
might
be
only
the
ease
which
your
engagement
to
*NL*
another
man
would
give
.
I
left
you
in
this
belief
;
and
yet
,
I
was
*NL*
determined
to
see
you
again
.
My
spirits
rallied
with
the
morning
,
and
*NL*
I
felt
that
I
had
still
a
motive
for
remaining
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Anne
was
at
home
again
,
and
happier
than
any
one
in
that
house
*NL*
could
have
conceived
.
All
the
surprise
and
suspense
,
and
every
other
*NL*
painful
part
of
the
morning
dissipated
by
this
conversation
,
she
*NL*
re-entered
the
house
so
happy
as
to
be
obliged
to
find
an
alloy
in
some
*NL*
momentary
apprehensions
of
its
being
impossible
to
last
.
An
interval
*NL*
of
meditation
,
serious
and
grateful
,
was
the
best
corrective
of
*NL*
everything
dangerous
in
such
high-wrought
felicity
;
and
she
went
to
her
*NL*
room
,
and
grew
steadfast
and
fearless
in
the
thankfulness
of
her
*NL*
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
came
,
the
drawing-rooms
were
lighted
up
,
the
company
*NL*
assembled
.
It
was
but
a
card
party
,
it
was
but
a
mixture
of
those
who
*NL*
had
never
met
before
,
and
those
who
met
too
often
;
a
commonplace
*NL*
business
,
too
numerous
for
intimacy
,
too
small
for
variety
;
but
Anne
*NL*
had
never
found
an
evening
shorter
.
Glowing
and
lovely
in
sensibility
*NL*
and
happiness
,
and
more
generally
admired
than
she
thought
about
or
*NL*
cared
for
,
she
had
cheerful
or
forbearing
feelings
for
every
creature
*NL*
around
her
.
Mr
Elliot
was
there
;
she
avoided
,
but
she
could
pity
him
.
*NL*
The
Wallises
,
she
had
amusement
in
understanding
them
.
Lady
Dalrymple
*NL*
and
Miss
Carteret
--
they
would
soon
be
innoxious
cousins
to
her
.
She
*NL*
cared
not
for
Mrs
Clay
,
and
had
nothing
to
blush
for
in
the
public
*NL*
manners
of
her
father
and
sister
.
With
the
Musgroves
,
there
was
the
*NL*
happy
chat
of
perfect
ease
;
with
Captain
Harville
,
the
kind-hearted
*NL*
intercourse
of
brother
and
sister
;
with
Lady
Russell
,
attempts
at
*NL*
conversation
,
which
a
delicious
consciousness
cut
short
;
with
Admiral
*NL*
and
Mrs
Croft
,
everything
of
peculiar
cordiality
and
fervent
interest
,
*NL*
which
the
same
consciousness
sought
to
conceal
;
and
with
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
,
some
moments
of
communications
continually
occurring
,
and
*NL*
always
the
hope
of
more
,
and
always
the
knowledge
of
his
being
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
one
of
these
short
meetings
,
each
apparently
occupied
in
*NL*
admiring
a
fine
display
of
greenhouse
plants
,
that
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
over
the
past
,
and
trying
impartially
to
judge
of
*NL*
the
right
and
wrong
,
I
mean
with
regard
to
myself
;
and
I
must
believe
*NL*
that
I
was
right
,
much
as
I
suffered
from
it
,
that
I
was
perfectly
*NL*
right
in
being
guided
by
the
friend
whom
you
will
love
better
than
you
*NL*
do
now
.
To
me
,
she
was
in
the
place
of
a
parent
.
Do
not
mistake
me
,
*NL*
however
.
I
am
not
saying
that
she
did
not
err
in
her
advice
.
It
was
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
one
of
those
cases
in
which
advice
is
good
or
bad
only
as
the
*NL*
event
decides
;
and
for
myself
,
I
certainly
never
should
,
in
any
*NL*
circumstance
of
tolerable
similarity
,
give
such
advice
.
But
I
mean
,
*NL*
that
I
was
right
in
submitting
to
her
,
and
that
if
I
had
done
*NL*
otherwise
,
I
should
have
suffered
more
in
continuing
the
engagement
*NL*
than
I
did
even
in
giving
it
up
,
because
I
should
have
suffered
in
my
*NL*
conscience
.
I
have
now
,
as
far
as
such
a
sentiment
is
allowable
in
*NL*
human
nature
,
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
;
and
if
I
mistake
not
,
a
*NL*
strong
sense
of
duty
is
no
bad
part
of
a
woman
's
portion
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
,
looked
at
Lady
Russell
,
and
looking
again
at
her
,
*NL*
replied
,
as
if
in
cool
deliberation
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
.
But
there
are
hopes
of
her
being
forgiven
in
time
.
I
trust
*NL*
to
being
in
charity
with
her
soon
.
But
I
too
have
been
thinking
over
*NL*
the
past
,
and
a
question
has
suggested
itself
,
whether
there
may
not
*NL*
have
been
one
person
more
my
enemy
even
than
that
lady
?
My
own
self
.
*NL*
Tell
me
if
,
when
I
returned
to
England
in
the
year
eight
,
with
a
few
*NL*
thousand
pounds
,
and
was
posted
into
the
Laconia
,
if
I
had
then
written
*NL*
to
you
,
would
you
have
answered
my
letter
?
Would
you
,
in
short
,
have
*NL*
renewed
the
engagement
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
I
!
''
was
all
her
answer
;
but
the
accent
was
decisive
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
he
cried
,
``
you
would
!
It
is
not
that
I
did
not
think
of
*NL*
it
,
or
desire
it
,
as
what
could
alone
crown
all
my
other
success
;
but
I
*NL*
was
proud
,
too
proud
to
ask
again
.
I
did
not
understand
you
.
I
shut
*NL*
my
eyes
,
and
would
not
understand
you
,
or
do
you
justice
.
This
is
a
*NL*
recollection
which
ought
to
make
me
forgive
every
one
sooner
than
*NL*
myself
.
Six
years
of
separation
and
suffering
might
have
been
spared
.
*NL*
It
is
a
sort
of
pain
,
too
,
which
is
new
to
me
.
I
have
been
used
to
the
*NL*
gratification
of
believing
myself
to
earn
every
blessing
that
I
*NL*
enjoyed
.
I
have
valued
myself
on
honourable
toils
and
just
rewards

*NL*
Like
other
great
men
under
reverses

''
he
added
,
with
a
smile
.
``
I
must
*NL*
endeavour
to
subdue
my
mind
to
my
fortune
.
I
must
learn
to
brook
being
*NL*
happier
than
I
deserve

Chapter
24
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Who
can
be
in
doubt
of
what
followed
?
When
any
two
young
people
take
*NL*
it
into
their
heads
to
marry
,
they
are
pretty
sure
by
perseverance
to
*NL*
carry
their
point
,
be
they
ever
so
poor
,
or
ever
so
imprudent
,
or
ever
*NL*
so
little
likely
to
be
necessary
to
each
other
's
ultimate
comfort
.
*NL*
This
may
be
bad
morality
to
conclude
with
,
but
I
believe
it
to
be
*NL*
truth
;
and
if
such
parties
succeed
,
how
should
a
Captain
Wentworth
and
*NL*
an
Anne
Elliot
,
with
the
advantage
of
maturity
of
mind
,
consciousness
*NL*
of
right
,
and
one
independent
fortune
between
them
,
fail
of
bearing
*NL*
down
every
opposition
?
They
might
in
fact
,
have
borne
down
a
great
*NL*
deal
more
than
they
met
with
,
for
there
was
little
to
distress
them
*NL*
beyond
the
want
of
graciousness
and
warmth
.
Sir
Walter
made
no
*NL*
objection
,
and
Elizabeth
did
nothing
worse
than
look
cold
and
*NL*
unconcerned
.
Captain
Wentworth
,
with
five-and-twenty
thousand
pounds
,
*NL*
and
as
high
in
his
profession
as
merit
and
activity
could
place
him
,
*NL*
was
no
longer
nobody
.
He
was
now
esteemed
quite
worthy
to
address
the
*NL*
daughter
of
a
foolish
,
spendthrift
baronet
,
who
had
not
had
principle
*NL*
or
sense
enough
to
maintain
himself
in
the
situation
in
which
*NL*
Providence
had
placed
him
,
and
who
could
give
his
daughter
at
present
*NL*
but
a
small
part
of
the
share
of
ten
thousand
pounds
which
must
be
hers
*NL*
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Walter
,
indeed
,
though
he
had
no
affection
for
Anne
,
and
no
vanity
*NL*
flattered
,
to
make
him
really
happy
on
the
occasion
,
was
very
far
from
*NL*
thinking
it
a
bad
match
for
her
.
On
the
contrary
,
when
he
saw
more
of
*NL*
Captain
Wentworth
,
saw
him
repeatedly
by
daylight
,
and
eyed
him
well
,
*NL*
he
was
very
much
struck
by
his
personal
claims
,
and
felt
that
his
*NL*
superiority
of
appearance
might
be
not
unfairly
balanced
against
her
*NL*
superiority
of
rank
;
and
all
this
,
assisted
by
his
well-sounding
name
,
*NL*
enabled
Sir
Walter
at
last
to
prepare
his
pen
,
with
a
very
good
grace
,
*NL*
for
the
insertion
of
the
marriage
in
the
volume
of
honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
one
among
them
,
whose
opposition
of
feeling
could
excite
any
*NL*
serious
anxiety
was
Lady
Russell
.
Anne
knew
that
Lady
Russell
must
be
*NL*
suffering
some
pain
in
understanding
and
relinquishing
Mr
Elliot
,
and
*NL*
be
making
some
struggles
to
become
truly
acquainted
with
,
and
do
*NL*
justice
to
Captain
Wentworth
.
This
however
was
what
Lady
Russell
had
*NL*
now
to
do
.
She
must
learn
to
feel
that
she
had
been
mistaken
with
*NL*
regard
to
both
;
that
she
had
been
unfairly
influenced
by
appearances
in
*NL*
each
;
that
because
Captain
Wentworth
's
manners
had
not
suited
her
own
*NL*
ideas
,
she
had
been
too
quick
in
suspecting
them
to
indicate
a
*NL*
character
of
dangerous
impetuosity
;
and
that
because
Mr
Elliot
's
*NL*
manners
had
precisely
pleased
her
in
their
propriety
and
correctness
,
*NL*
their
general
politeness
and
suavity
,
she
had
been
too
quick
in
*NL*
receiving
them
as
the
certain
result
of
the
most
correct
opinions
and
*NL*
well-regulated
mind
.
There
was
nothing
less
for
Lady
Russell
to
do
,
*NL*
than
to
admit
that
she
had
been
pretty
completely
wrong
,
and
to
take
up
*NL*
a
new
set
of
opinions
and
of
hopes
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
quickness
of
perception
in
some
,
a
nicety
in
the
discernment
*NL*
of
character
,
a
natural
penetration
,
in
short
,
which
no
experience
in
*NL*
others
can
equal
,
and
Lady
Russell
had
been
less
gifted
in
this
part
of
*NL*
understanding
than
her
young
friend
.
But
she
was
a
very
good
woman
,
*NL*
and
if
her
second
object
was
to
be
sensible
and
well-judging
,
her
first
*NL*
was
to
see
Anne
happy
.
She
loved
Anne
better
than
she
loved
her
own
*NL*
abilities
;
and
when
the
awkwardness
of
the
beginning
was
over
,
found
*NL*
little
hardship
in
attaching
herself
as
a
mother
to
the
man
who
was
*NL*
securing
the
happiness
of
her
other
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
the
family
,
Mary
was
probably
the
one
most
immediately
gratified
*NL*
by
the
circumstance
.
It
was
creditable
to
have
a
sister
married
,
and
*NL*
she
might
flatter
herself
with
having
been
greatly
instrumental
to
the
*NL*
connexion
,
by
keeping
Anne
with
her
in
the
autumn
;
and
as
her
own
*NL*
sister
must
be
better
than
her
husband
's
sisters
,
it
was
very
agreeable
*NL*
that
Captain
Wentworth
should
be
a
richer
man
than
either
Captain
*NL*
Benwick
or
Charles
Hayter
.
She
had
something
to
suffer
,
perhaps
,
when
*NL*
they
came
into
contact
again
,
in
seeing
Anne
restored
to
the
rights
of
*NL*
seniority
,
and
the
mistress
of
a
very
pretty
landaulette
;
but
she
had
a
*NL*
future
to
look
forward
to
,
of
powerful
consolation
.
Anne
had
no
*NL*
Uppercross
Hall
before
her
,
no
landed
estate
,
no
headship
of
a
family
;
*NL*
and
if
they
could
but
keep
Captain
Wentworth
from
being
made
a
baronet
,
*NL*
she
would
not
change
situations
with
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
well
for
the
eldest
sister
if
she
were
equally
satisfied
*NL*
with
her
situation
,
for
a
change
is
not
very
probable
there
.
She
had
*NL*
soon
the
mortification
of
seeing
Mr
Elliot
withdraw
,
and
no
one
of
*NL*
proper
condition
has
since
presented
himself
to
raise
even
the
*NL*
unfounded
hopes
which
sunk
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
of
his
cousin
Anne
's
engagement
burst
on
Mr
Elliot
most
*NL*
unexpectedly
.
It
deranged
his
best
plan
of
domestic
happiness
,
his
*NL*
best
hope
of
keeping
Sir
Walter
single
by
the
watchfulness
which
a
*NL*
son-in-law
's
rights
would
have
given
.
But
,
though
discomfited
and
*NL*
disappointed
,
he
could
still
do
something
for
his
own
interest
and
his
*NL*
own
enjoyment
.
He
soon
quitted
Bath
;
and
on
Mrs
Clay
's
quitting
it
*NL*
soon
afterwards
,
and
being
next
heard
of
as
established
under
his
*NL*
protection
in
London
,
it
was
evident
how
double
a
game
he
had
been
*NL*
playing
,
and
how
determined
he
was
to
save
himself
from
being
cut
out
*NL*
by
one
artful
woman
,
at
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Clay
's
affections
had
overpowered
her
interest
,
and
she
had
*NL*
sacrificed
,
for
the
young
man
's
sake
,
the
possibility
of
scheming
*NL*
longer
for
Sir
Walter
.
She
has
abilities
,
however
,
as
well
as
*NL*
affections
;
and
it
is
now
a
doubtful
point
whether
his
cunning
,
or
*NL*
hers
,
may
finally
carry
the
day
;
whether
,
after
preventing
her
from
*NL*
being
the
wife
of
Sir
Walter
,
he
may
not
be
wheedled
and
caressed
at
*NL*
last
into
making
her
the
wife
of
Sir
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
can
not
be
doubted
that
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
were
shocked
and
*NL*
mortified
by
the
loss
of
their
companion
,
and
the
discovery
of
their
*NL*
deception
in
her
.
They
had
their
great
cousins
,
to
be
sure
,
to
resort
*NL*
to
for
comfort
;
but
they
must
long
feel
that
to
flatter
and
follow
*NL*
others
,
without
being
flattered
and
followed
in
turn
,
is
but
a
state
of
*NL*
half
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
,
satisfied
at
a
very
early
period
of
Lady
Russell
's
meaning
to
*NL*
love
Captain
Wentworth
as
she
ought
,
had
no
other
alloy
to
the
*NL*
happiness
of
her
prospects
than
what
arose
from
the
consciousness
of
*NL*
having
no
relations
to
bestow
on
him
which
a
man
of
sense
could
value
.
*NL*
There
she
felt
her
own
inferiority
very
keenly
.
The
disproportion
in
*NL*
their
fortune
was
nothing
;
it
did
not
give
her
a
moment
's
regret
;
but
*NL*
to
have
no
family
to
receive
and
estimate
him
properly
,
nothing
of
*NL*
respectability
,
of
harmony
,
of
good
will
to
offer
in
return
for
all
the
*NL*
worth
and
all
the
prompt
welcome
which
met
her
in
his
brothers
and
*NL*
sisters
,
was
a
source
of
as
lively
pain
as
her
mind
could
well
be
*NL*
sensible
of
under
circumstances
of
otherwise
strong
felicity
.
She
had
*NL*
but
two
friends
in
the
world
to
add
to
his
list
,
Lady
Russell
and
Mrs
*NL*
Smith
.
To
those
,
however
,
he
was
very
well
disposed
to
attach
himself
.
*NL*
Lady
Russell
,
in
spite
of
all
her
former
transgressions
,
he
could
now
*NL*
value
from
his
heart
.
While
he
was
not
obliged
to
say
that
he
believed
*NL*
her
to
have
been
right
in
originally
dividing
them
,
he
was
ready
to
say
*NL*
almost
everything
else
in
her
favour
,
and
as
for
Mrs
Smith
,
she
had
*NL*
claims
of
various
kinds
to
recommend
her
quickly
and
permanently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
recent
good
offices
by
Anne
had
been
enough
in
themselves
,
and
*NL*
their
marriage
,
instead
of
depriving
her
of
one
friend
,
secured
her
*NL*
two
.
She
was
their
earliest
visitor
in
their
settled
life
;
and
Captain
*NL*
Wentworth
,
by
putting
her
in
the
way
of
recovering
her
husband
's
*NL*
property
in
the
West
Indies
,
by
writing
for
her
,
acting
for
her
,
and
*NL*
seeing
her
through
all
the
petty
difficulties
of
the
case
with
the
*NL*
activity
and
exertion
of
a
fearless
man
and
a
determined
friend
,
fully
*NL*
requited
the
services
which
she
had
rendered
,
or
ever
meant
to
render
,
*NL*
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Smith
's
enjoyments
were
not
spoiled
by
this
improvement
of
income
,
*NL*
with
some
improvement
of
health
,
and
the
acquisition
of
such
friends
to
*NL*
be
often
with
,
for
her
cheerfulness
and
mental
alacrity
did
not
fail
*NL*
her
;
and
while
these
prime
supplies
of
good
remained
,
she
might
have
*NL*
bid
defiance
even
to
greater
accessions
of
worldly
prosperity
.
She
*NL*
might
have
been
absolutely
rich
and
perfectly
healthy
,
and
yet
be
*NL*
happy
.
Her
spring
of
felicity
was
in
the
glow
of
her
spirits
,
as
her
*NL*
friend
Anne
's
was
in
the
warmth
of
her
heart
.
Anne
was
tenderness
*NL*
itself
,
and
she
had
the
full
worth
of
it
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
*NL*
affection
.
His
profession
was
all
that
could
ever
make
her
friends
*NL*
wish
that
tenderness
less
,
the
dread
of
a
future
war
all
that
could
dim
*NL*
her
sunshine
.
She
gloried
in
being
a
sailor
's
wife
,
but
she
must
pay
*NL*
the
tax
of
quick
alarm
for
belonging
to
that
profession
which
is
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
more
distinguished
in
its
domestic
virtues
than
in
its
*NL*
national
importance
.
