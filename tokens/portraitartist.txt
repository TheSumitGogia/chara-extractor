Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Once
upon
a
time
and
a
very
good
time
it
was
there
was
a
moocow
coming
*NL*
down
along
the
road
and
this
moocow
that
was
coming
down
along
the
road
*NL*
met
a
nicens
little
boy
named
baby
tuckoo
...
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
told
him
that
story
:
his
father
looked
at
him
through
a
*NL*
glass
:
he
had
a
hairy
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
baby
tuckoo
.
The
moocow
came
down
the
road
where
Betty
Byrne
*NL*
lived
:
she
sold
lemon
platt
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
,
the
wild
rose
blossoms
*NL*
On
the
little
green
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sang
that
song
.
That
was
his
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
,
the
green
wothe
botheth
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
you
wet
the
bed
first
it
is
warm
then
it
gets
cold
.
His
mother
put
*NL*
on
the
oilsheet
.
That
had
the
queer
smell
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
had
a
nicer
smell
than
his
father
.
She
played
on
the
piano
*NL*
the
sailor
's
hornpipe
for
him
to
dance
.
He
danced
:
*NL*
*NL*
Tralala
lala
,
*NL*
Tralala
tralaladdy
,
*NL*
Tralala
lala
,
*NL*
Tralala
lala
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Charles
and
Dante
clapped
.
They
were
older
than
his
father
and
*NL*
mother
but
uncle
Charles
was
older
than
Dante
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dante
had
two
brushes
in
her
press
.
The
brush
with
the
maroon
velvet
*NL*
back
was
for
Michael
Davitt
and
the
brush
with
the
green
velvet
back
*NL*
was
for
Parnell
.
Dante
gave
him
a
cachou
every
time
he
brought
her
a
*NL*
piece
of
tissue
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Vances
lived
in
number
seven
.
They
had
a
different
father
and
*NL*
mother
.
They
were
Eileen
's
father
and
mother
.
When
they
were
grown
up
*NL*
he
was
going
to
marry
Eileen
.
He
hid
under
the
table
.
His
mother
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
Stephen
will
apologize
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dante
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
if
not
,
the
eagles
will
come
and
pull
out
his
eyes
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Pull
out
his
eyes
,
*NL*
Apologize
,
*NL*
Apologize
,
*NL*
Pull
out
his
eyes
.
*NL*
Apologize
,
*NL*
Pull
out
his
eyes
,
*NL*
Pull
out
his
eyes
,
*NL*
Apologize
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
The
wide
playgrounds
were
swarming
with
boys
.
All
were
shouting
and
the
*NL*
prefects
urged
them
on
with
strong
cries
.
The
evening
air
was
pale
and
*NL*
chilly
and
after
every
charge
and
thud
of
the
footballers
the
greasy
*NL*
leather
orb
flew
like
a
heavy
bird
through
the
grey
light
.
He
kept
on
*NL*
the
fringe
of
his
line
,
out
of
sight
of
his
prefect
,
out
of
the
reach
*NL*
of
the
rude
feet
,
feigning
to
run
now
and
then
.
He
felt
his
body
small
*NL*
and
weak
amid
the
throng
of
the
players
and
his
eyes
were
weak
and
*NL*
watery
.
Rody
Kickham
was
not
like
that
:
he
would
be
captain
of
the
*NL*
third
line
all
the
fellows
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rody
Kickham
was
a
decent
fellow
but
Nasty
Roche
was
a
stink
.
Rody
*NL*
Kickham
had
greaves
in
his
number
and
a
hamper
in
the
refectory
.
Nasty
*NL*
Roche
had
big
hands
.
He
called
the
Friday
pudding
dog-in-the-blanket
.
*NL*
And
one
day
he
had
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
your
name
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
had
answered
:
Stephen
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Nasty
Roche
had
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
kind
of
a
name
is
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
Stephen
had
not
been
able
to
answer
Nasty
Roche
had
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
your
father
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
had
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Nasty
Roche
had
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
he
a
magistrate
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
crept
about
from
point
to
point
on
the
fringe
of
his
line
,
making
*NL*
little
runs
now
and
then
.
But
his
hands
were
bluish
with
cold
.
He
kept
*NL*
his
hands
in
the
side
pockets
of
his
belted
grey
suit
.
That
was
a
belt
*NL*
round
his
pocket
.
And
belt
was
also
to
give
a
fellow
a
belt
.
One
day
a
*NL*
fellow
said
to
Cantwell
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'd
give
you
such
a
belt
in
a
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cantwell
had
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Go
and
fight
your
match
.
Give
Cecil
Thunder
a
belt
.
I
'd
like
to
see
*NL*
you
.
He
'd
give
you
a
toe
in
the
rump
for
yourself
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
not
a
nice
expression
.
His
mother
had
told
him
not
to
speak
*NL*
with
the
rough
boys
in
the
college
.
Nice
mother
!
The
first
day
in
the
*NL*
hall
of
the
castle
when
she
had
said
goodbye
she
had
put
up
her
veil
*NL*
double
to
her
nose
to
kiss
him
:
and
her
nose
and
eyes
were
red
.
But
he
*NL*
had
pretended
not
to
see
that
she
was
going
to
cry
.
She
was
a
nice
*NL*
mother
but
she
was
not
so
nice
when
she
cried
.
And
his
father
had
given
*NL*
him
two
five-shilling
pieces
for
pocket
money
.
And
his
father
had
told
*NL*
him
if
he
wanted
anything
to
write
home
to
him
and
,
whatever
he
did
,
*NL*
never
to
peach
on
a
fellow
.
Then
at
the
door
of
the
castle
the
rector
*NL*
had
shaken
hands
with
his
father
and
mother
,
his
soutane
fluttering
in
*NL*
the
breeze
,
and
the
car
had
driven
off
with
his
father
and
mother
on
*NL*
it
.
They
had
cried
to
him
from
the
car
,
waving
their
hands
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Goodbye
,
Stephen
,
goodbye
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Goodbye
,
Stephen
,
goodbye
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
caught
in
the
whirl
of
a
scrimmage
and
,
fearful
of
the
flashing
*NL*
eyes
and
muddy
boots
,
bent
down
to
look
through
the
legs
.
The
fellows
*NL*
were
struggling
and
groaning
and
their
legs
were
rubbing
and
kicking
*NL*
and
stamping
.
Then
Jack
Lawton
's
yellow
boots
dodged
out
the
ball
and
*NL*
all
the
other
boots
and
legs
ran
after
.
He
ran
after
them
a
little
way
*NL*
and
then
stopped
.
It
was
useless
to
run
on
.
Soon
they
would
be
going
*NL*
home
for
the
holidays
.
After
supper
in
the
study
hall
he
would
change
*NL*
the
number
pasted
up
inside
his
desk
from
seventy-seven
to
seventy-six
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
better
to
be
in
the
study
hall
than
out
there
in
the
cold
.
*NL*
The
sky
was
pale
and
cold
but
there
were
lights
in
the
castle
.
He
*NL*
wondered
from
which
window
Hamilton
Rowan
had
thrown
his
hat
on
the
*NL*
ha-ha
and
had
there
been
flowerbeds
at
that
time
under
the
windows
.
One
*NL*
day
when
he
had
been
called
to
the
castle
the
butler
had
shown
him
the
*NL*
marks
of
the
soldiers
'
slugs
in
the
wood
of
the
door
and
had
given
him
*NL*
a
piece
of
shortbread
that
the
community
ate
.
It
was
nice
and
warm
to
*NL*
see
the
lights
in
the
castle
.
It
was
like
something
in
a
book
.
Perhaps
*NL*
Leicester
Abbey
was
like
that
.
And
there
were
nice
sentences
in
Doctor
*NL*
Cornwell
's
Spelling
Book
.
They
were
like
poetry
but
they
were
only
*NL*
sentences
to
learn
the
spelling
from
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Wolsey
died
in
Leicester
Abbey
*NL*
Where
the
abbots
buried
him
.
*NL*
Canker
is
a
disease
of
plants
,
*NL*
Cancer
one
of
animals
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
nice
to
lie
on
the
hearthrug
before
the
fire
,
leaning
his
*NL*
head
upon
his
hands
,
and
think
on
those
sentences
.
He
shivered
as
if
he
*NL*
had
cold
slimy
water
next
his
skin
.
That
was
mean
of
Wells
to
shoulder
*NL*
him
into
the
square
ditch
because
he
would
not
swop
his
little
snuff
*NL*
box
for
Wells
's
seasoned
hacking
chestnut
,
the
conqueror
of
forty
.
How
*NL*
cold
and
slimy
the
water
had
been
!
A
fellow
had
once
seen
a
big
rat
*NL*
jump
into
the
scum
.
Mother
was
sitting
at
the
fire
with
Dante
waiting
*NL*
for
Brigid
to
bring
in
the
tea
.
She
had
her
feet
on
the
fender
and
her
*NL*
jewelly
slippers
were
so
hot
and
they
had
such
a
lovely
warm
smell
!
*NL*
Dante
knew
a
lot
of
things
.
She
had
taught
him
where
the
Mozambique
*NL*
Channel
was
and
what
was
the
longest
river
in
America
and
what
was
the
*NL*
name
of
the
highest
mountain
in
the
moon
.
Father
Arnall
knew
more
than
*NL*
Dante
because
he
was
a
priest
but
both
his
father
and
uncle
Charles
*NL*
said
that
Dante
was
a
clever
woman
and
a
well-read
woman
.
And
when
*NL*
Dante
made
that
noise
after
dinner
and
then
put
up
her
hand
to
her
*NL*
mouth
:
that
was
heartburn
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
cried
far
out
on
the
playground
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
All
in
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
other
voices
cried
from
the
lower
and
third
lines
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
All
in
!
All
in
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
players
closed
around
,
flushed
and
muddy
,
and
he
went
among
them
,
*NL*
glad
to
go
in
.
Rody
Kickham
held
the
ball
by
its
greasy
lace
.
A
fellow
*NL*
asked
him
to
give
it
one
last
:
but
he
walked
on
without
even
answering
*NL*
the
fellow
.
Simon
Moonan
told
him
not
to
because
the
prefect
was
*NL*
looking
.
The
fellow
turned
to
Simon
Moonan
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
all
know
why
you
speak
.
You
are
McGlade
's
suck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suck
was
a
queer
word
.
The
fellow
called
Simon
Moonan
that
name
because
*NL*
Simon
Moonan
used
to
tie
the
prefect
's
false
sleeves
behind
his
back
*NL*
and
the
prefect
used
to
let
on
to
be
angry
.
But
the
sound
was
ugly
.
*NL*
Once
he
had
washed
his
hands
in
the
lavatory
of
the
Wicklow
Hotel
and
*NL*
his
father
pulled
the
stopper
up
by
the
chain
after
and
the
dirty
water
*NL*
went
down
through
the
hole
in
the
basin
.
And
when
it
had
all
gone
down
*NL*
slowly
the
hole
in
the
basin
had
made
a
sound
like
that
:
suck
.
Only
*NL*
louder
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
remember
that
and
the
white
look
of
the
lavatory
made
him
feel
cold
*NL*
and
then
hot
.
There
were
two
cocks
that
you
turned
and
water
came
out
:
*NL*
cold
and
hot
.
He
felt
cold
and
then
a
little
hot
:
and
he
could
see
the
*NL*
names
printed
on
the
cocks
.
That
was
a
very
queer
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
air
in
the
corridor
chilled
him
too
.
It
was
queer
and
wettish
.
*NL*
But
soon
the
gas
would
be
lit
and
in
burning
it
made
a
light
noise
like
*NL*
a
little
song
.
Always
the
same
:
and
when
the
fellows
stopped
talking
in
*NL*
the
playroom
you
could
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
hour
for
sums
.
Father
Arnall
wrote
a
hard
sum
on
the
board
*NL*
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
then
,
who
will
win
?
Go
ahead
,
York
!
Go
ahead
,
Lancaster
!
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
tried
his
best
,
but
the
sum
was
too
hard
and
he
felt
confused
.
*NL*
The
little
silk
badge
with
the
white
rose
on
it
that
was
pinned
on
the
*NL*
breast
of
his
jacket
began
to
flutter
.
He
was
no
good
at
sums
,
but
he
*NL*
tried
his
best
so
that
York
might
not
lose
.
Father
Arnall
's
face
looked
*NL*
very
black
,
but
he
was
not
in
a
wax
:
he
was
laughing
.
Then
Jack
Lawton
*NL*
cracked
his
fingers
and
Father
Arnall
looked
at
his
copybook
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Right
.
Bravo
Lancaster
!
The
red
rose
wins
.
Come
on
now
,
York
!
Forge
*NL*
ahead
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jack
Lawton
looked
over
from
his
side
.
The
little
silk
badge
with
the
*NL*
red
rose
on
it
looked
very
rich
because
he
had
a
blue
sailor
top
on
.
*NL*
Stephen
felt
his
own
face
red
too
,
thinking
of
all
the
bets
about
who
*NL*
would
get
first
place
in
elements
,
Jack
Lawton
or
he
.
Some
weeks
Jack
*NL*
Lawton
got
the
card
for
first
and
some
weeks
he
got
the
card
for
first
.
*NL*
His
white
silk
badge
fluttered
and
fluttered
as
he
worked
at
the
next
*NL*
sum
and
heard
Father
Arnall
's
voice
.
Then
all
his
eagerness
passed
away
*NL*
and
he
felt
his
face
quite
cool
.
He
thought
his
face
must
be
white
*NL*
because
it
felt
so
cool
.
He
could
not
get
out
the
answer
for
the
sum
*NL*
but
it
did
not
matter
.
White
roses
and
red
roses
:
those
were
beautiful
*NL*
colours
to
think
of
.
And
the
cards
for
first
place
and
second
place
and
*NL*
third
place
were
beautiful
colours
too
:
pink
and
cream
and
lavender
.
*NL*
Lavender
and
cream
and
pink
roses
were
beautiful
to
think
of
.
Perhaps
a
*NL*
wild
rose
might
be
like
those
colours
and
he
remembered
the
song
about
*NL*
the
wild
rose
blossoms
on
the
little
green
place
.
But
you
could
not
*NL*
have
a
green
rose
.
But
perhaps
somewhere
in
the
world
you
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bell
rang
and
then
the
classes
began
to
file
out
of
the
rooms
and
*NL*
along
the
corridors
towards
the
refectory
.
He
sat
looking
at
the
two
*NL*
prints
of
butter
on
his
plate
but
could
not
eat
the
damp
bread
.
The
*NL*
tablecloth
was
damp
and
limp
.
But
he
drank
off
the
hot
weak
tea
which
*NL*
the
clumsy
scullion
,
girt
with
a
white
apron
,
poured
into
his
cup
.
He
*NL*
wondered
whether
the
scullion
's
apron
was
damp
too
or
whether
all
white
*NL*
things
were
cold
and
damp
.
Nasty
Roche
and
Saurin
drank
cocoa
that
*NL*
their
people
sent
them
in
tins
.
They
said
they
could
not
drink
the
tea
;
*NL*
that
it
was
hogwash
.
Their
fathers
were
magistrates
,
the
fellows
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
boys
seemed
to
him
very
strange
.
They
had
all
fathers
and
*NL*
mothers
and
different
clothes
and
voices
.
He
longed
to
be
at
home
and
*NL*
lay
his
head
on
his
mother
's
lap
.
But
he
could
not
:
and
so
he
longed
*NL*
for
the
play
and
study
and
prayers
to
be
over
and
to
be
in
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drank
another
cup
of
hot
tea
and
Fleming
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
up
?
Have
you
a
pain
or
what
's
up
with
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
n't
know
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sick
in
your
breadbasket
,
Fleming
said
,
because
your
face
looks
*NL*
white
.
It
will
go
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
yes
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
not
sick
there
.
He
thought
that
he
was
sick
in
his
heart
if
*NL*
you
could
be
sick
in
that
place
.
Fleming
was
very
decent
to
ask
him
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
cry
.
He
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
shut
and
opened
*NL*
the
flaps
of
his
ears
.
Then
he
heard
the
noise
of
the
refectory
every
*NL*
time
he
opened
the
flaps
of
his
ears
.
It
made
a
roar
like
a
train
at
*NL*
night
.
And
when
he
closed
the
flaps
the
roar
was
shut
off
like
a
train
*NL*
going
into
a
tunnel
.
That
night
at
Dalkey
the
train
had
roared
like
*NL*
that
and
then
,
when
it
went
into
the
tunnel
,
the
roar
stopped
.
He
*NL*
closed
his
eyes
and
the
train
went
on
,
roaring
and
then
stopping
;
*NL*
roaring
again
,
stopping
.
It
was
nice
to
hear
it
roar
and
stop
and
then
*NL*
roar
out
of
the
tunnel
again
and
then
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
higher
line
fellows
began
to
come
down
along
the
matting
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
refectory
,
Paddy
Rath
and
Jimmy
Magee
and
the
*NL*
Spaniard
who
was
allowed
to
smoke
cigars
and
the
little
Portuguese
who
*NL*
wore
the
woolly
cap
.
And
then
the
lower
line
tables
and
the
tables
of
*NL*
the
third
line
.
And
every
single
fellow
had
a
different
way
of
walking
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
playroom
pretending
to
watch
a
game
of
*NL*
dominoes
and
once
or
twice
he
was
able
to
hear
for
an
instant
the
*NL*
little
song
of
the
gas
.
The
prefect
was
at
the
door
with
some
boys
and
*NL*
Simon
Moonan
was
knotting
his
false
sleeves
.
He
was
telling
them
*NL*
something
about
Tullabeg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
away
from
the
door
and
Wells
came
over
to
Stephen
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
us
,
Dedalus
,
do
you
kiss
your
mother
before
you
go
to
bed
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wells
turned
to
the
other
fellows
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
I
say
,
here
's
a
fellow
says
he
kisses
his
mother
every
night
*NL*
before
he
goes
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
fellows
stopped
their
game
and
turned
round
,
laughing
.
*NL*
Stephen
blushed
under
their
eyes
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wells
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
I
say
,
here
's
a
fellow
says
he
does
n't
kiss
his
mother
before
he
*NL*
goes
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
laughed
again
.
Stephen
tried
to
laugh
with
them
.
He
felt
his
*NL*
whole
body
hot
and
confused
in
a
moment
.
What
was
the
right
answer
to
*NL*
the
question
?
He
had
given
two
and
still
Wells
laughed
.
But
Wells
must
*NL*
know
the
right
answer
for
he
was
in
third
of
grammar
.
He
tried
to
think
*NL*
of
Wells
's
mother
but
he
did
not
dare
to
raise
his
eyes
to
Wells
's
*NL*
face
.
He
did
not
like
Wells
's
face
.
It
was
Wells
who
had
shouldered
him
*NL*
into
the
square
ditch
the
day
before
because
he
would
not
swop
his
*NL*
little
snuff
box
for
Wells
's
seasoned
hacking
chestnut
,
the
conqueror
*NL*
of
forty
.
It
was
a
mean
thing
to
do
;
all
the
fellows
said
it
was
.
And
*NL*
how
cold
and
slimy
the
water
had
been
!
And
a
fellow
had
once
seen
a
big
*NL*
rat
jump
plop
into
the
scum
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cold
slime
of
the
ditch
covered
his
whole
body
;
and
,
when
the
bell
*NL*
rang
for
study
and
the
lines
filed
out
of
the
playrooms
,
he
felt
the
*NL*
cold
air
of
the
corridor
and
staircase
inside
his
clothes
.
He
still
*NL*
tried
to
think
what
was
the
right
answer
.
Was
it
right
to
kiss
his
*NL*
mother
or
wrong
to
kiss
his
mother
?
What
did
that
mean
,
to
kiss
?
You
*NL*
put
your
face
up
like
that
to
say
good
night
and
then
his
mother
put
*NL*
her
face
down
.
That
was
to
kiss
.
His
mother
put
her
lips
on
his
cheek
;
*NL*
her
lips
were
soft
and
they
wetted
his
cheek
;
and
they
made
a
tiny
*NL*
little
noise
:
kiss
.
Why
did
people
do
that
with
their
two
faces
?
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
in
the
study
hall
he
opened
the
lid
of
his
desk
and
changed
the
*NL*
number
pasted
up
inside
from
seventy-seven
to
seventy-six
.
But
the
*NL*
Christmas
vacation
was
very
far
away
:
but
one
time
it
would
come
*NL*
because
the
earth
moved
round
always
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
picture
of
the
earth
on
the
first
page
of
his
geography
:
a
*NL*
big
ball
in
the
middle
of
clouds
.
Fleming
had
a
box
of
crayons
and
one
*NL*
night
during
free
study
he
had
coloured
the
earth
green
and
the
clouds
*NL*
maroon
.
That
was
like
the
two
brushes
in
Dante
's
press
,
the
brush
with
*NL*
the
green
velvet
back
for
Parnell
and
the
brush
with
the
maroon
velvet
*NL*
back
for
Michael
Davitt
.
But
he
had
not
told
Fleming
to
colour
them
*NL*
those
colours
.
Fleming
had
done
it
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
the
geography
to
study
the
lesson
;
but
he
could
not
learn
the
*NL*
names
of
places
in
America
.
Still
they
were
all
different
places
that
*NL*
had
different
names
.
They
were
all
in
different
countries
and
the
*NL*
countries
were
in
continents
and
the
continents
were
in
the
world
and
*NL*
the
world
was
in
the
universe
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
the
flyleaf
of
the
geography
and
read
what
he
had
written
*NL*
there
:
himself
,
his
name
and
where
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
Dedalus
*NL*
Class
of
Elements
*NL*
Clongowes
Wood
College
*NL*
Sallins
*NL*
County
Kildare
*NL*
Ireland
*NL*
Europe
*NL*
The
World
*NL*
The
Universe
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
in
his
writing
:
and
Fleming
one
night
for
a
cod
had
written
on
*NL*
the
opposite
page
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
Dedalus
is
my
name
,
*NL*
Ireland
is
my
nation
.
*NL*
Clongowes
is
my
dwellingplace
*NL*
And
heaven
my
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
the
verses
backwards
but
then
they
were
not
poetry
.
Then
he
*NL*
read
the
flyleaf
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
till
he
came
to
his
own
*NL*
name
.
That
was
he
:
and
he
read
down
the
page
again
.
What
was
after
the
*NL*
universe
?
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
.
But
was
there
anything
round
the
universe
to
show
where
it
*NL*
stopped
before
the
nothing
place
began
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
could
not
be
a
wall
;
but
there
could
be
a
thin
thin
line
there
all
*NL*
round
everything
.
It
was
very
big
to
think
about
everything
and
*NL*
everywhere
.
Only
God
could
do
that
.
He
tried
to
think
what
a
big
*NL*
thought
that
must
be
;
but
he
could
only
think
of
God
.
God
was
God
's
*NL*
name
just
as
his
name
was
Stephen
.
DIEU
was
the
French
for
God
and
that
*NL*
was
God
's
name
too
;
and
when
anyone
prayed
to
God
and
said
DIEU
then
*NL*
God
knew
at
once
that
it
was
a
French
person
that
was
praying
.
But
,
*NL*
though
there
were
different
names
for
God
in
all
the
different
*NL*
languages
in
the
world
and
God
understood
what
all
the
people
who
*NL*
prayed
said
in
their
different
languages
,
still
God
remained
always
the
*NL*
same
God
and
God
's
real
name
was
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
him
very
tired
to
think
that
way
.
It
made
him
feel
his
head
*NL*
very
big
.
He
turned
over
the
flyleaf
and
looked
wearily
at
the
green
*NL*
round
earth
in
the
middle
of
the
maroon
clouds
.
He
wondered
which
was
*NL*
right
,
to
be
for
the
green
or
for
the
maroon
,
because
Dante
had
ripped
*NL*
the
green
velvet
back
off
the
brush
that
was
for
Parnell
one
day
with
*NL*
her
scissors
and
had
told
him
that
Parnell
was
a
bad
man
.
He
wondered
*NL*
if
they
were
arguing
at
home
about
that
.
That
was
called
politics
.
*NL*
There
were
two
sides
in
it
:
Dante
was
on
one
side
and
his
father
and
Mr
*NL*
Casey
were
on
the
other
side
but
his
mother
and
uncle
Charles
were
on
*NL*
no
side
.
Every
day
there
was
something
in
the
paper
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
pained
him
that
he
did
not
know
well
what
politics
meant
and
that
he
*NL*
did
not
know
where
the
universe
ended
.
He
felt
small
and
weak
.
When
*NL*
would
he
be
like
the
fellows
in
poetry
and
rhetoric
?
They
had
big
*NL*
voices
and
big
boots
and
they
studied
trigonometry
.
That
was
very
far
*NL*
away
.
First
came
the
vacation
and
then
the
next
term
and
then
vacation
*NL*
again
and
then
again
another
term
and
then
again
the
vacation
.
It
was
*NL*
like
a
train
going
in
and
out
of
tunnels
and
that
was
like
the
noise
of
*NL*
the
boys
eating
in
the
refectory
when
you
opened
and
closed
the
flaps
*NL*
of
the
ears
.
Term
,
vacation
;
tunnel
,
out
;
noise
,
stop
.
How
far
away
it
*NL*
was
!
It
was
better
to
go
to
bed
to
sleep
.
Only
prayers
in
the
chapel
*NL*
and
then
bed
.
He
shivered
and
yawned
.
It
would
be
lovely
in
bed
after
*NL*
the
sheets
got
a
bit
hot
.
First
they
were
so
cold
to
get
into
.
He
*NL*
shivered
to
think
how
cold
they
were
first
.
But
then
they
got
hot
and
*NL*
then
he
could
sleep
.
It
was
lovely
to
be
tired
.
He
yawned
again
.
Night
*NL*
prayers
and
then
bed
:
he
shivered
and
wanted
to
yawn
.
It
would
be
*NL*
lovely
in
a
few
minutes
.
He
felt
a
warm
glow
creeping
up
from
the
cold
*NL*
shivering
sheets
,
warmer
and
warmer
till
he
felt
warm
all
over
,
ever
so
*NL*
warm
and
yet
he
shivered
a
little
and
still
wanted
to
yawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bell
rang
for
night
prayers
and
he
filed
out
of
the
study
hall
*NL*
after
the
others
and
down
the
staircase
and
along
the
corridors
to
the
*NL*
chapel
.
The
corridors
were
darkly
lit
and
the
chapel
was
darkly
lit
.
*NL*
Soon
all
would
be
dark
and
sleeping
.
There
was
cold
night
air
in
the
*NL*
chapel
and
the
marbles
were
the
colour
the
sea
was
at
night
.
The
sea
*NL*
was
cold
day
and
night
:
but
it
was
colder
at
night
.
It
was
cold
and
*NL*
dark
under
the
seawall
beside
his
father
's
house
.
But
the
kettle
would
*NL*
be
on
the
hob
to
make
punch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prefect
of
the
chapel
prayed
above
his
head
and
his
memory
knew
the
*NL*
responses
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
O
Lord
open
our
lips
*NL*
And
our
mouths
shall
announce
Thy
praise
.
*NL*
Incline
unto
our
aid
,
O
God
!
*NL*
O
Lord
make
haste
to
help
us
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
cold
night
smell
in
the
chapel
.
But
it
was
a
holy
smell
.
It
*NL*
was
not
like
the
smell
of
the
old
peasants
who
knelt
at
the
back
of
the
*NL*
chapel
at
Sunday
mass
.
That
was
a
smell
of
air
and
rain
and
turf
and
*NL*
corduroy
.
But
they
were
very
holy
peasants
.
They
breathed
behind
him
on
*NL*
his
neck
and
sighed
as
they
prayed
.
They
lived
in
Clane
,
a
fellow
said
:
*NL*
there
were
little
cottages
there
and
he
had
seen
a
woman
standing
at
*NL*
the
half-door
of
a
cottage
with
a
child
in
her
arms
as
the
cars
had
*NL*
come
past
from
Sallins
.
It
would
be
lovely
to
sleep
for
one
night
in
*NL*
that
cottage
before
the
fire
of
smoking
turf
,
in
the
dark
lit
by
the
*NL*
fire
,
in
the
warm
dark
,
breathing
the
smell
of
the
peasants
,
air
and
*NL*
rain
and
turf
and
corduroy
.
But
O
,
the
road
there
between
the
trees
*NL*
was
dark
!
You
would
be
lost
in
the
dark
.
It
made
him
afraid
to
think
*NL*
of
how
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
the
voice
of
the
prefect
of
the
chapel
saying
the
last
*NL*
prayers
.
He
prayed
it
too
against
the
dark
outside
under
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VISIT
,
WE
BESEECH
THEE
,
O
LORD
,
THIS
HABITATION
AND
DRIVE
*NL*
AWAY
FROM
IT
ALL
THE
SNARES
OF
THE
ENEMY
.
MAY
THY
HOLY
*NL*
ANGELS
DWELL
HEREIN
TO
PRESERVE
US
IN
PEACE
AND
MAY
THY
*NL*
BLESSINGS
BE
ALWAYS
UPON
US
THROUGH
CHRIST
OUR
LORD
.
*NL*
AMEN
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
fingers
trembled
as
he
undressed
himself
in
the
dormitory
.
He
told
*NL*
his
fingers
to
hurry
up
.
He
had
to
undress
and
then
kneel
and
say
his
*NL*
own
prayers
and
be
in
bed
before
the
gas
was
lowered
so
that
he
might
*NL*
not
go
to
hell
when
he
died
.
He
rolled
his
stockings
off
and
put
on
his
*NL*
nightshirt
quickly
and
knelt
trembling
at
his
bedside
and
repeated
his
*NL*
prayers
quickly
,
fearing
that
the
gas
would
go
down
.
He
felt
his
*NL*
shoulders
shaking
as
he
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
God
bless
my
father
and
my
mother
and
spare
them
to
me
!
*NL*
God
bless
my
little
brothers
and
sisters
and
spare
them
to
me
!
*NL*
God
bless
Dante
and
Uncle
Charles
and
spare
them
to
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
blessed
himself
and
climbed
quickly
into
bed
and
,
tucking
the
end
of
*NL*
the
nightshirt
under
his
feet
,
curled
himself
together
under
the
cold
*NL*
white
sheets
,
shaking
and
trembling
.
But
he
would
not
go
to
hell
when
*NL*
he
died
;
and
the
shaking
would
stop
.
A
voice
bade
the
boys
in
the
*NL*
dormitory
good
night
.
He
peered
out
for
an
instant
over
the
coverlet
*NL*
and
saw
the
yellow
curtains
round
and
before
his
bed
that
shut
him
off
*NL*
on
all
sides
.
The
light
was
lowered
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prefect
's
shoes
went
away
.
Where
?
Down
the
staircase
and
along
the
*NL*
corridors
or
to
his
room
at
the
end
?
He
saw
the
dark
.
Was
it
true
about
*NL*
the
black
dog
that
walked
there
at
night
with
eyes
as
big
as
*NL*
carriage-lamps
?
They
said
it
was
the
ghost
of
a
murderer
.
A
long
shiver
*NL*
of
fear
flowed
over
his
body
.
He
saw
the
dark
entrance
hall
of
the
*NL*
castle
.
Old
servants
in
old
dress
were
in
the
ironing-room
above
the
*NL*
staircase
.
It
was
long
ago
.
The
old
servants
were
quiet
.
There
was
a
*NL*
fire
there
,
but
the
hall
was
still
dark
.
A
figure
came
up
the
staircase
*NL*
from
the
hall
.
He
wore
the
white
cloak
of
a
marshal
;
his
face
was
pale
*NL*
and
strange
;
he
held
his
hand
pressed
to
his
side
.
He
looked
out
of
*NL*
strange
eyes
at
the
old
servants
.
They
looked
at
him
and
saw
their
*NL*
master
's
face
and
cloak
and
knew
that
he
had
received
his
death-wound
.
*NL*
But
only
the
dark
was
where
they
looked
:
only
dark
silent
air
.
Their
*NL*
master
had
received
his
death-wound
on
the
battlefield
of
Prague
far
*NL*
away
over
the
sea
.
He
was
standing
on
the
field
;
his
hand
was
pressed
*NL*
to
his
side
;
his
face
was
pale
and
strange
and
he
wore
the
white
cloak
*NL*
of
a
marshal
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
how
cold
and
strange
it
was
to
think
of
that
!
All
the
dark
was
cold
*NL*
and
strange
.
There
were
pale
strange
faces
there
,
great
eyes
like
*NL*
carriage-lamps
.
They
were
the
ghosts
of
murderers
,
the
figures
of
*NL*
marshals
who
had
received
their
death-wound
on
battlefields
far
away
*NL*
over
the
sea
.
What
did
they
wish
to
say
that
their
faces
were
so
*NL*
strange
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VISIT
,
WE
BESEECH
THEE
,
O
LORD
,
THIS
HABITATION
AND
DRIVE
AWAY
FROM
IT
*NL*
ALL
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Going
home
for
the
holidays
!
That
would
be
lovely
:
the
fellows
had
told
*NL*
him
.
Getting
up
on
the
cars
in
the
early
wintry
morning
outside
the
*NL*
door
of
the
castle
.
The
cars
were
rolling
on
the
gravel
.
Cheers
for
the
*NL*
rector
!
*NL*
*NL*
Hurray
!
Hurray
!
Hurray
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
cars
drove
past
the
chapel
and
all
caps
were
raised
.
They
drove
*NL*
merrily
along
the
country
roads
.
The
drivers
pointed
with
their
whips
*NL*
to
Bodenstown
.
The
fellows
cheered
.
They
passed
the
farmhouse
*NL*
of
the
Jolly
Farmer
.
Cheer
after
cheer
after
cheer
.
Through
Clane
they
*NL*
drove
,
cheering
and
cheered
.
The
peasant
women
stood
at
the
half-doors
,
*NL*
the
men
stood
here
and
there
.
The
lovely
smell
there
was
in
the
wintry
*NL*
air
:
the
smell
of
Clane
:
rain
and
wintry
air
and
turf
smouldering
and
*NL*
corduroy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
was
full
of
fellows
:
a
long
long
chocolate
train
with
cream
*NL*
facings
.
The
guards
went
to
and
fro
opening
,
closing
,
locking
,
*NL*
unlocking
the
doors
.
They
were
men
in
dark
blue
and
silver
;
they
had
*NL*
silvery
whistles
and
their
keys
made
a
quick
music
:
click
,
click
:
*NL*
click
,
click
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
train
raced
on
over
the
flat
lands
and
past
the
Hill
of
Allen
.
*NL*
The
telegraph
poles
were
passing
,
passing
.
The
train
went
on
and
on
.
It
*NL*
knew
.
There
were
lanterns
in
the
hall
of
his
father
's
house
and
ropes
*NL*
of
green
branches
.
There
were
holly
and
ivy
round
the
pierglass
and
*NL*
holly
and
ivy
,
green
and
red
,
twined
round
the
chandeliers
.
There
were
*NL*
red
holly
and
green
ivy
round
the
old
portraits
on
the
walls
.
Holly
and
*NL*
ivy
for
him
and
for
Christmas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lovely
...
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
people
.
Welcome
home
,
Stephen
!
Noises
of
welcome
.
His
mother
*NL*
kissed
him
.
Was
that
right
?
His
father
was
a
marshal
now
:
higher
than
a
*NL*
magistrate
.
Welcome
home
,
Stephen
!
*NL*
*NL*
Noises
...
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
noise
of
curtain-rings
running
back
along
the
rods
,
of
*NL*
water
being
splashed
in
the
basins
.
There
was
a
noise
of
rising
and
*NL*
dressing
and
washing
in
the
dormitory
:
a
noise
of
clapping
of
hands
as
*NL*
the
prefect
went
up
and
down
telling
the
fellows
to
look
sharp
.
A
pale
*NL*
sunlight
showed
the
yellow
curtains
drawn
back
,
the
tossed
beds
.
His
*NL*
bed
was
very
hot
and
his
face
and
body
were
very
hot
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
sat
on
the
side
of
his
bed
.
He
was
weak
.
He
tried
to
pull
*NL*
on
his
stocking
.
It
had
a
horrid
rough
feel
.
The
sunlight
was
queer
and
*NL*
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fleming
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
not
well
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
;
and
Fleming
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Get
back
into
bed
.
I
'll
tell
McGlade
you
're
not
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
sick
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
is
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
McGlade
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Get
back
into
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
he
sick
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
fellow
held
his
arms
while
he
loosened
the
stocking
clinging
to
his
*NL*
foot
and
climbed
back
into
the
hot
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crouched
down
between
the
sheets
,
glad
of
their
tepid
glow
.
He
heard
*NL*
the
fellows
talk
among
themselves
about
him
as
they
dressed
for
mass
.
*NL*
It
was
a
mean
thing
to
do
,
to
shoulder
him
into
the
square
ditch
,
they
*NL*
were
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
their
voices
ceased
;
they
had
gone
.
A
voice
at
his
bed
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dedalus
,
do
n't
spy
on
us
,
sure
you
wo
n't
?
*NL*
*NL*
Wells
's
face
was
there
.
He
looked
at
it
and
saw
that
Wells
was
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
did
n't
mean
to
.
Sure
you
wo
n't
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
had
told
him
,
whatever
he
did
,
never
to
peach
on
a
fellow
.
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
and
answered
no
and
felt
glad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wells
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
did
n't
mean
to
,
honour
bright
.
It
was
only
for
cod
.
I
'm
sorry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
and
the
voice
went
away
.
Sorry
because
he
was
afraid
.
Afraid
*NL*
that
it
was
some
disease
.
Canker
was
a
disease
of
plants
and
cancer
one
*NL*
of
animals
:
or
another
different
.
That
was
a
long
time
ago
then
out
on
*NL*
the
playgrounds
in
the
evening
light
,
creeping
from
point
to
point
on
*NL*
the
fringe
of
his
line
,
a
heavy
bird
flying
low
through
the
grey
light
.
*NL*
Leicester
Abbey
lit
up
.
Wolsey
died
there
.
The
abbots
buried
him
*NL*
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
Wells
's
face
,
it
was
the
prefect
's
.
He
was
not
foxing
.
No
,
*NL*
no
:
he
was
sick
really
.
He
was
not
foxing
.
And
he
felt
the
prefect
's
*NL*
hand
on
his
forehead
;
and
he
felt
his
forehead
warm
and
damp
against
*NL*
the
prefect
's
cold
damp
hand
.
That
was
the
way
a
rat
felt
,
slimy
and
*NL*
damp
and
cold
.
Every
rat
had
two
eyes
to
look
out
of
.
Sleek
slimy
*NL*
coats
,
little
little
feet
tucked
up
to
jump
,
black
slimy
eyes
to
look
*NL*
out
of
.
They
could
understand
how
to
jump
.
But
the
minds
of
rats
could
*NL*
not
understand
trigonometry
.
When
they
were
dead
they
lay
on
their
*NL*
sides
.
Their
coats
dried
then
.
They
were
only
dead
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prefect
was
there
again
and
it
was
his
voice
that
was
saying
that
*NL*
he
was
to
get
up
,
that
Father
Minister
had
said
he
was
to
get
up
and
*NL*
dress
and
go
to
the
infirmary
.
And
while
he
was
dressing
himself
as
*NL*
quickly
as
he
could
the
prefect
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
must
pack
off
to
Brother
Michael
because
we
have
the
*NL*
collywobbles
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
decent
to
say
that
.
That
was
all
to
make
him
laugh
.
But
he
*NL*
could
not
laugh
because
his
cheeks
and
lips
were
all
shivery
:
and
then
*NL*
the
prefect
had
to
laugh
by
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prefect
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Quick
march
!
Hayfoot
!
Strawfoot
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
together
down
the
staircase
and
along
the
corridor
and
past
*NL*
the
bath
.
As
he
passed
the
door
he
remembered
with
a
vague
fear
the
*NL*
warm
turf-coloured
bogwater
,
the
warm
moist
air
,
the
noise
of
plunges
,
*NL*
the
smell
of
the
towels
,
like
medicine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brother
Michael
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
infirmary
and
from
the
*NL*
door
of
the
dark
cabinet
on
his
right
came
a
smell
like
medicine
.
That
*NL*
came
from
the
bottles
on
the
shelves
.
The
prefect
spoke
to
Brother
*NL*
Michael
and
Brother
Michael
answered
and
called
the
prefect
sir
.
He
had
*NL*
reddish
hair
mixed
with
grey
and
a
queer
look
.
It
was
queer
that
he
*NL*
would
always
be
a
brother
.
It
was
queer
too
that
you
could
not
call
him
*NL*
sir
because
he
was
a
brother
and
had
a
different
kind
of
look
.
Was
he
*NL*
not
holy
enough
or
why
could
he
not
catch
up
on
the
others
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
beds
in
the
room
and
in
one
bed
there
was
a
fellow
:
and
*NL*
when
they
went
in
he
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hello
!
It
's
young
Dedalus
!
What
's
up
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
sky
is
up
,
Brother
Michael
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
fellow
out
of
the
third
of
grammar
and
,
while
Stephen
was
*NL*
undressing
,
he
asked
Brother
Michael
to
bring
him
a
round
of
buttered
*NL*
toast
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
,
do
!
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Butter
you
up
!
said
Brother
Michael
.
You
'll
get
your
walking
papers
*NL*
in
the
morning
when
the
doctor
comes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Will
I
?
the
fellow
said
.
I
'm
not
well
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brother
Michael
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
'll
get
your
walking
papers
.
I
tell
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
down
to
rake
the
fire
.
He
had
a
long
back
like
the
long
back
of
*NL*
a
tramhorse
.
He
shook
the
poker
gravely
and
nodded
his
head
at
the
*NL*
fellow
out
of
third
of
grammar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Brother
Michael
went
away
and
after
a
while
the
fellow
out
of
*NL*
third
of
grammar
turned
in
towards
the
wall
and
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
infirmary
.
He
was
sick
then
.
Had
they
written
home
to
tell
*NL*
his
mother
and
father
?
But
it
would
be
quicker
for
one
of
the
priests
*NL*
to
go
himself
to
tell
them
.
Or
he
would
write
a
letter
for
the
priest
*NL*
to
bring
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Mother
,
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
sick
.
I
want
to
go
home
.
Please
come
and
take
me
home
.
*NL*
I
am
in
the
infirmary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
fond
son
,
*NL*
Stephen
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
How
far
away
they
were
!
There
was
cold
sunlight
outside
the
window
.
He
*NL*
wondered
if
he
would
die
.
You
could
die
just
the
same
on
a
sunny
day
.
*NL*
He
might
die
before
his
mother
came
.
Then
he
would
have
a
dead
mass
in
*NL*
the
chapel
like
the
way
the
fellows
had
told
him
it
was
when
Little
had
*NL*
died
.
All
the
fellows
would
be
at
the
mass
,
dressed
in
black
,
all
with
*NL*
sad
faces
.
Wells
too
would
be
there
but
no
fellow
would
look
at
him
.
*NL*
The
rector
would
be
there
in
a
cope
of
black
and
gold
and
there
would
*NL*
be
tall
yellow
candles
on
the
altar
and
round
the
catafalque
.
And
they
*NL*
would
carry
the
coffin
out
of
the
chapel
slowly
and
he
would
be
buried
*NL*
in
the
little
graveyard
of
the
community
off
the
main
avenue
of
limes
.
*NL*
And
Wells
would
be
sorry
then
for
what
he
had
done
.
And
the
bell
would
*NL*
toll
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hear
the
tolling
.
He
said
over
to
himself
the
song
that
Brigid
*NL*
had
taught
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dingdong
!
The
castle
bell
!
*NL*
Farewell
,
my
mother
!
*NL*
Bury
me
in
the
old
churchyard
*NL*
Beside
my
eldest
brother
.
*NL*
My
coffin
shall
be
black
,
*NL*
Six
angels
at
my
back
,
*NL*
Two
to
sing
and
two
to
pray
*NL*
And
two
to
carry
my
soul
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
How
beautiful
and
sad
that
was
!
How
beautiful
the
words
were
where
they
*NL*
said
BURY
ME
IN
THE
OLD
CHURCHYARD
!
A
tremor
passed
over
his
body
.
How
*NL*
sad
and
how
beautiful
!
He
wanted
to
cry
quietly
but
not
for
himself
:
*NL*
for
the
words
,
so
beautiful
and
sad
,
like
music
.
The
bell
!
The
bell
!
*NL*
Farewell
!
O
farewell
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
cold
sunlight
was
weaker
and
Brother
Michael
was
standing
at
his
*NL*
bedside
with
a
bowl
of
beef-tea
.
He
was
glad
for
his
mouth
was
hot
and
*NL*
dry
.
He
could
hear
them
playing
in
the
playgrounds
.
And
the
day
was
*NL*
going
on
in
the
college
just
as
if
he
were
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Brother
Michael
was
going
away
and
the
fellow
out
of
the
third
of
*NL*
grammar
told
him
to
be
sure
and
come
back
and
tell
him
all
the
news
in
*NL*
the
paper
.
He
told
Stephen
that
his
name
was
Athy
and
that
his
father
*NL*
kept
a
lot
of
racehorses
that
were
spiffing
jumpers
and
that
his
father
*NL*
would
give
a
good
tip
to
Brother
Michael
any
time
he
wanted
it
because
*NL*
Brother
Michael
was
very
decent
and
always
told
him
the
news
out
of
the
*NL*
paper
they
got
every
day
up
in
the
castle
.
There
was
every
kind
of
news
*NL*
in
the
paper
:
accidents
,
shipwrecks
,
sports
,
and
politics
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
it
is
all
about
politics
in
the
papers
,
he
said
.
Do
your
people
*NL*
talk
about
that
too
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mine
too
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
thought
for
a
moment
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
have
a
queer
name
,
Dedalus
,
and
I
have
a
queer
name
too
,
Athy
.
*NL*
My
name
is
the
name
of
a
town
.
Your
name
is
like
Latin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
good
at
riddles
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
very
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Can
you
answer
me
this
one
?
Why
is
the
county
of
Kildare
like
the
*NL*
leg
of
a
fellow
's
breeches
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
thought
what
could
be
the
answer
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
give
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Because
there
is
a
thigh
in
it
,
he
said
.
Do
you
see
the
joke
?
Athy
*NL*
is
the
town
in
the
county
Kildare
and
a
thigh
is
the
other
thigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Oh
,
I
see
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
an
old
riddle
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
say
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
?
asked
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
know
,
he
said
,
you
can
ask
that
riddle
another
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Can
you
?
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
same
riddle
,
he
said
.
Do
you
know
the
other
way
to
ask
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Can
you
not
think
of
the
other
way
?
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
Stephen
over
the
bedclothes
as
he
spoke
.
Then
he
lay
back
*NL*
on
the
pillow
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
is
another
way
but
I
wo
n't
tell
you
what
it
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
he
not
tell
it
?
His
father
,
who
kept
the
racehorses
,
must
be
a
*NL*
magistrate
too
like
Saurin
's
father
and
Nasty
Roche
's
father
.
He
*NL*
thought
of
his
own
father
,
of
how
he
sang
songs
while
his
mother
played
*NL*
and
of
how
he
always
gave
him
a
shilling
when
he
asked
for
sixpence
and
*NL*
he
felt
sorry
for
him
that
he
was
not
a
magistrate
like
the
other
boys
'
*NL*
fathers
.
Then
why
was
he
sent
to
that
place
with
them
?
But
*NL*
his
father
had
told
him
that
he
would
be
no
stranger
there
because
his
*NL*
granduncle
had
presented
an
address
to
the
liberator
there
fifty
years
*NL*
before
.
You
could
know
the
people
of
that
time
by
their
old
dress
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
him
a
solemn
time
:
and
he
wondered
if
that
was
the
time
when
*NL*
the
fellows
in
Clongowes
wore
blue
coats
with
brass
buttons
and
yellow
*NL*
waistcoats
and
caps
of
rabbitskin
and
drank
beer
like
grown-up
people
*NL*
and
kept
greyhounds
of
their
own
to
course
the
hares
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
the
window
and
saw
that
the
daylight
had
grown
weaker
.
*NL*
There
would
be
cloudy
grey
light
over
the
playgrounds
.
There
was
no
*NL*
noise
on
the
playgrounds
.
The
class
must
be
doing
the
themes
or
perhaps
*NL*
Father
Arnall
was
reading
out
of
the
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
queer
that
they
had
not
given
him
any
medicine
.
Perhaps
Brother
*NL*
Michael
would
bring
it
back
when
he
came
.
They
said
you
got
stinking
*NL*
stuff
to
drink
when
you
were
in
the
infirmary
.
But
he
felt
better
now
*NL*
than
before
.
It
would
be
nice
getting
better
slowly
.
You
could
get
a
*NL*
book
then
.
There
was
a
book
in
the
library
about
Holland
.
There
were
*NL*
lovely
foreign
names
in
it
and
pictures
of
strange
looking
cities
and
*NL*
ships
.
It
made
you
feel
so
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
pale
the
light
was
at
the
window
!
But
that
was
nice
.
The
fire
rose
*NL*
and
fell
on
the
wall
.
It
was
like
waves
.
Someone
had
put
coal
on
and
he
*NL*
heard
voices
.
They
were
talking
.
It
was
the
noise
of
the
waves
.
Or
the
*NL*
waves
were
talking
among
themselves
as
they
rose
and
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
the
sea
of
waves
,
long
dark
waves
rising
and
falling
,
dark
under
*NL*
the
moonless
night
.
A
tiny
light
twinkled
at
the
pierhead
where
the
*NL*
ship
was
entering
:
and
he
saw
a
multitude
of
people
gathered
by
the
*NL*
waters
'
edge
to
see
the
ship
that
was
entering
their
harbour
.
A
tall
*NL*
man
stood
on
the
deck
,
looking
out
towards
the
flat
dark
land
:
and
by
*NL*
the
light
at
the
pierhead
he
saw
his
face
,
the
sorrowful
face
of
*NL*
Brother
Michael
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
him
lift
his
hand
towards
the
people
and
heard
him
say
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
of
sorrow
over
the
waters
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
is
dead
.
We
saw
him
lying
upon
the
catafalque
.
A
wail
of
sorrow
*NL*
went
up
from
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Parnell
!
Parnell
!
He
is
dead
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
fell
upon
their
knees
,
moaning
in
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
saw
Dante
in
a
maroon
velvet
dress
and
with
a
green
velvet
*NL*
mantle
hanging
from
her
shoulders
walking
proudly
and
silently
past
the
*NL*
people
who
knelt
by
the
water
's
edge
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
fire
,
banked
high
and
red
,
flamed
in
the
grate
and
under
the
*NL*
ivy-twined
branches
of
the
chandelier
the
Christmas
table
was
spread
.
*NL*
They
had
come
home
a
little
late
and
still
dinner
was
not
ready
:
but
it
*NL*
would
be
ready
in
a
jiffy
his
mother
had
said
.
They
were
waiting
for
*NL*
the
door
to
open
and
for
the
servants
to
come
in
,
holding
the
big
*NL*
dishes
covered
with
their
heavy
metal
covers
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
waiting
:
uncle
Charles
,
who
sat
far
away
in
the
shadow
of
the
*NL*
window
,
Dante
and
Mr
Casey
,
who
sat
in
the
easy-chairs
at
either
side
*NL*
of
the
hearth
,
Stephen
,
seated
on
a
chair
between
them
,
his
feet
*NL*
resting
on
the
toasted
boss
.
Mr
Dedalus
looked
at
himself
in
the
*NL*
pierglass
above
the
mantelpiece
,
waxed
out
his
moustache
ends
and
then
,
*NL*
parting
his
coat-tails
,
stood
with
his
back
to
the
glowing
fire
:
and
*NL*
still
from
time
to
time
he
withdrew
a
hand
from
his
coat-tail
to
wax
*NL*
out
one
of
his
moustache
ends
.
Mr
Casey
leaned
his
head
to
one
side
*NL*
and
,
smiling
,
tapped
the
gland
of
his
neck
with
his
fingers
.
And
*NL*
Stephen
smiled
too
for
he
knew
now
that
it
was
not
true
that
Mr
Casey
*NL*
had
a
purse
of
silver
in
his
throat
.
He
smiled
to
think
how
the
silvery
*NL*
noise
which
Mr
Casey
used
to
make
had
deceived
him
.
And
when
he
had
*NL*
tried
to
open
Mr
Casey
's
hand
to
see
if
the
purse
of
silver
was
hidden
*NL*
there
he
had
seen
that
the
fingers
could
not
be
straightened
out
:
and
*NL*
Mr
Casey
had
told
him
that
he
had
got
those
three
cramped
fingers
*NL*
making
a
birthday
present
for
Queen
Victoria
.
Mr
Casey
tapped
the
gland
*NL*
of
his
neck
and
smiled
at
Stephen
with
sleepy
eyes
:
and
Mr
Dedalus
said
*NL*
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
.
Well
now
,
that
's
all
right
.
O
,
we
had
a
good
walk
,
had
n't
we
,
*NL*
John
?
Yes
...
I
wonder
if
there
's
any
likelihood
of
dinner
this
evening
.
*NL*
Yes
...
O
,
well
now
,
we
got
a
good
breath
of
ozone
round
the
Head
today
.
Ay
,
*NL*
bedad
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
Dante
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
did
n't
stir
out
at
all
,
Mrs
Riordan
?
*NL*
*NL*
Dante
frowned
and
said
shortly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
dropped
his
coat-tails
and
went
over
to
the
sideboard
.
He
*NL*
brought
forth
a
great
stone
jar
of
whisky
from
the
locker
and
filled
*NL*
the
decanter
slowly
,
bending
now
and
then
to
see
how
much
he
had
poured
*NL*
in
.
Then
replacing
the
jar
in
the
locker
he
poured
a
little
of
the
*NL*
whisky
into
two
glasses
,
added
a
little
water
and
came
back
with
them
*NL*
to
the
fireplace
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
thimbleful
,
John
,
he
said
,
just
to
whet
your
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Casey
took
the
glass
,
drank
,
and
placed
it
near
him
on
the
*NL*
mantelpiece
.
Then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
of
our
friend
Christopher
manufacturing
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
into
a
fit
of
laughter
and
coughing
and
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
...
manufacturing
that
champagne
for
those
fellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
laughed
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
it
Christy
?
he
said
.
There
's
more
cunning
in
one
of
those
warts
*NL*
on
his
bald
head
than
in
a
pack
of
jack
foxes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
inclined
his
head
,
closed
his
eyes
,
and
,
licking
his
lips
profusely
,
*NL*
began
to
speak
with
the
voice
of
the
hotel
keeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
he
has
such
a
soft
mouth
when
he
's
speaking
to
you
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
know
.
He
's
very
moist
and
watery
about
the
dewlaps
,
God
bless
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Casey
was
still
struggling
through
his
fit
of
coughing
and
laughter
.
*NL*
Stephen
,
seeing
and
hearing
the
hotel
keeper
through
his
father
's
face
*NL*
and
voice
,
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
put
up
his
eyeglass
and
,
staring
down
at
him
,
said
quietly
*NL*
and
kindly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
are
you
laughing
at
,
you
little
puppy
,
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
servants
entered
and
placed
the
dishes
on
the
table
.
Mrs
Dedalus
*NL*
followed
and
the
places
were
arranged
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sit
over
,
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
went
to
the
end
of
the
table
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
,
Mrs
Riordan
,
sit
over
.
John
,
sit
you
down
,
my
hearty
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
round
to
where
uncle
Charles
sat
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
then
,
sir
,
there
's
a
bird
here
waiting
for
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
all
had
taken
their
seats
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
cover
and
then
*NL*
said
quickly
,
withdrawing
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
,
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
stood
up
in
his
place
to
say
the
grace
before
meals
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bless
us
,
O
Lord
,
and
these
Thy
gifts
which
through
*NL*
Thy
bounty
we
are
about
to
receive
through
Christ
our
*NL*
Lord
.
Amen
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
blessed
themselves
and
Mr
Dedalus
with
a
sigh
of
pleasure
lifted
*NL*
from
the
dish
the
heavy
cover
pearled
around
the
edge
with
glistening
*NL*
drops
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
looked
at
the
plump
turkey
which
had
lain
,
trussed
and
*NL*
skewered
,
on
the
kitchen
table
.
He
knew
that
his
father
had
paid
a
*NL*
guinea
for
it
in
Dunn
's
of
D'Olier
Street
and
that
the
man
had
prodded
*NL*
it
often
at
the
breastbone
to
show
how
good
it
was
:
and
he
remembered
*NL*
the
man
's
voice
when
he
had
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Take
that
one
,
sir
.
That
's
the
real
Ally
Daly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
Mr
Barrett
in
Clongowes
call
his
pandybat
a
turkey
?
But
*NL*
Clongowes
was
far
away
:
and
the
warm
heavy
smell
of
turkey
and
ham
and
*NL*
celery
rose
from
the
plates
and
dishes
and
the
great
fire
was
banked
*NL*
high
and
red
in
the
grate
and
the
green
ivy
and
red
holly
made
you
feel
*NL*
so
happy
and
when
dinner
was
ended
the
big
plum
pudding
would
be
*NL*
carried
in
,
studded
with
peeled
almonds
and
sprigs
of
holly
,
with
*NL*
bluish
fire
running
around
it
and
a
little
green
flag
flying
from
the
*NL*
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
his
first
Christmas
dinner
and
he
thought
of
his
little
brothers
*NL*
and
sisters
who
were
waiting
in
the
nursery
,
as
he
had
often
waited
,
*NL*
till
the
pudding
came
.
The
deep
low
collar
and
the
Eton
jacket
made
him
*NL*
feel
queer
and
oldish
:
and
that
morning
when
his
mother
had
brought
him
*NL*
down
to
the
parlour
,
dressed
for
mass
,
his
father
had
cried
.
That
was
*NL*
because
he
was
thinking
of
his
own
father
.
And
uncle
Charles
had
said
*NL*
so
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
covered
the
dish
and
began
to
eat
hungrily
.
Then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Poor
old
Christy
,
he
's
nearly
lopsided
now
with
roguery
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Simon
,
said
Mrs
Dedalus
,
you
have
n't
given
Mrs
Riordan
any
sauce
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
seized
the
sauceboat
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Have
n't
I
?
he
cried
.
Mrs
Riordan
,
pity
the
poor
blind
.
Dante
covered
*NL*
her
plate
with
her
hands
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
thanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
turned
to
uncle
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
are
you
off
,
sir
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Right
as
the
mail
,
Simon
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
,
John
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
all
right
.
Go
on
yourself
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mary
?
Here
,
Stephen
,
here
's
something
to
make
your
hair
curl
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
poured
sauce
freely
over
Stephen
's
plate
and
set
the
boat
again
on
*NL*
the
table
.
Then
he
asked
uncle
Charles
was
it
tender
.
Uncle
Charles
*NL*
could
not
speak
because
his
mouth
was
full
;
but
he
nodded
that
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
was
a
good
answer
our
friend
made
to
the
canon
.
What
?
said
Mr
*NL*
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
did
n't
think
he
had
that
much
in
him
,
said
Mr
Casey
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'LL
PAY
YOUR
DUES
,
FATHER
,
WHEN
YOU
CEASE
TURNING
THE
HOUSE
OF
GOD
*NL*
INTO
A
POLLING-BOOTH
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
nice
answer
,
said
Dante
,
for
any
man
calling
himself
a
catholic
to
*NL*
give
to
his
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
have
only
themselves
to
blame
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
suavely
.
If
they
*NL*
took
a
fool
's
advice
they
would
confine
their
attention
to
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
religion
,
Dante
said
.
They
are
doing
their
duty
in
warning
the
*NL*
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
go
to
the
house
of
God
,
Mr
Casey
said
,
in
all
humility
to
pray
to
*NL*
our
Maker
and
not
to
hear
election
addresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
religion
,
Dante
said
again
.
They
are
right
.
They
must
direct
*NL*
their
flocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
preach
politics
from
the
altar
,
is
it
?
asked
Mr
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Certainly
,
said
Dante
.
It
is
a
question
of
public
morality
.
A
priest
*NL*
would
not
be
a
priest
if
he
did
not
tell
his
flock
what
is
right
and
*NL*
what
is
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Dedalus
laid
down
her
knife
and
fork
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
For
pity
sake
and
for
pity
sake
let
us
have
no
political
discussion
*NL*
on
this
day
of
all
days
in
the
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Quite
right
,
ma'am
,
said
uncle
Charles
.
Now
,
Simon
,
that
's
quite
*NL*
enough
now
.
Not
another
word
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
yes
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
uncovered
the
dish
boldly
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
then
,
who
's
for
more
turkey
?
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
answered
.
Dante
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nice
language
for
any
catholic
to
use
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mrs
Riordan
,
I
appeal
to
you
,
said
Mrs
Dedalus
,
to
let
the
matter
*NL*
drop
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dante
turned
on
her
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
am
I
to
sit
here
and
listen
to
the
pastors
of
my
church
being
*NL*
flouted
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nobody
is
saying
a
word
against
them
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
,
so
long
as
*NL*
they
do
n't
meddle
in
politics
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
bishops
and
priests
of
Ireland
have
spoken
,
said
Dante
,
and
they
*NL*
must
be
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
them
leave
politics
alone
,
said
Mr
Casey
,
or
the
people
may
*NL*
leave
their
church
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
hear
?
said
Dante
,
turning
to
Mrs
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mr
Casey
!
Simon
!
said
Mrs
Dedalus
,
let
it
end
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Too
bad
!
Too
bad
!
said
uncle
Charles
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
?
cried
Mr
Dedalus
.
Were
we
to
desert
him
at
the
bidding
of
the
*NL*
English
people
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
was
no
longer
worthy
to
lead
,
said
Dante
.
He
was
a
public
sinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
are
all
sinners
and
black
sinners
,
said
Mr
Casey
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
WOE
BE
TO
THE
MAN
BY
WHOM
THE
SCANDAL
COMETH
!
said
Mrs
Riordan
.
IT
*NL*
WOULD
BE
BETTER
FOR
HIM
THAT
A
MILLSTONE
WERE
TIED
ABOUT
HIS
NECK
AND
*NL*
THAT
HE
WERE
CAST
INTO
THE
DEPTHS
OF
THE
SEA
RATHER
THAN
THAT
HE
SHOULD
*NL*
SCANDALIZE
ONE
OF
THESE
,
MY
LEAST
LITTLE
ONES
.
That
is
the
language
of
*NL*
the
Holy
Ghost
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
very
bad
language
if
you
ask
me
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Simon
!
Simon
!
said
uncle
Charles
.
The
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
yes
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
I
meant
about
the
...
I
was
thinking
about
the
*NL*
bad
language
of
the
railway
porter
.
Well
now
,
that
's
all
right
.
Here
,
*NL*
Stephen
,
show
me
your
plate
,
old
chap
.
Eat
away
now
.
Here
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heaped
up
the
food
on
Stephen
's
plate
and
served
uncle
Charles
and
*NL*
Mr
Casey
to
large
pieces
of
turkey
and
splashes
of
sauce
.
Mrs
Dedalus
*NL*
was
eating
little
and
Dante
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
.
She
was
red
*NL*
in
the
face
.
Mr
Dedalus
rooted
with
the
carvers
at
the
end
of
the
dish
*NL*
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
's
a
tasty
bit
here
we
call
the
pope
's
nose
.
If
any
lady
or
*NL*
gentleman
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
a
piece
of
fowl
up
on
the
prong
of
the
carving
fork
.
Nobody
*NL*
spoke
.
He
put
it
on
his
own
plate
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
you
ca
n't
say
but
you
were
asked
.
I
think
I
had
better
eat
it
*NL*
myself
because
I
'm
not
well
in
my
health
lately
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
winked
at
Stephen
and
,
replacing
the
dish-cover
,
began
to
eat
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
while
he
ate
.
Then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
now
,
the
day
kept
up
fine
after
all
.
There
were
plenty
of
*NL*
strangers
down
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
spoke
.
He
said
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
think
there
were
more
strangers
down
than
last
Christmas
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
round
at
the
others
whose
faces
were
bent
towards
their
*NL*
plates
and
,
receiving
no
reply
,
waited
for
a
moment
and
said
bitterly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
my
Christmas
dinner
has
been
spoiled
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
could
be
neither
luck
nor
grace
,
Dante
said
,
in
a
house
where
*NL*
there
is
no
respect
for
the
pastors
of
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
threw
his
knife
and
fork
noisily
on
his
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Respect
!
he
said
.
Is
it
for
Billy
with
the
lip
or
for
the
tub
of
*NL*
guts
up
in
Armagh
?
Respect
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Princes
of
the
church
,
said
Mr
Casey
with
slow
scorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Lord
Leitrim
's
coachman
,
yes
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
are
the
Lord
's
anointed
,
Dante
said
.
They
are
an
honour
to
their
*NL*
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tub
of
guts
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
coarsely
.
He
has
a
handsome
face
,
mind
*NL*
you
,
in
repose
.
You
should
see
that
fellow
lapping
up
his
bacon
and
*NL*
cabbage
of
a
cold
winter
's
day
.
O
Johnny
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
twisted
his
features
into
a
grimace
of
heavy
bestiality
and
made
a
*NL*
lapping
noise
with
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Really
,
Simon
,
you
should
not
speak
that
way
before
Stephen
.
It
's
*NL*
not
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
he
'll
remember
all
this
when
he
grows
up
,
said
Dante
hotly
--
the
*NL*
language
he
heard
against
God
and
religion
and
priests
in
his
own
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
him
remember
too
,
cried
Mr
Casey
to
her
from
across
the
table
,
*NL*
the
language
with
which
the
priests
and
the
priests
'
pawns
broke
*NL*
Parnell
's
heart
and
hounded
him
into
his
grave
.
Let
him
remember
that
*NL*
too
when
he
grows
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sons
of
bitches
!
cried
Mr
Dedalus
.
When
he
was
down
they
turned
on
*NL*
him
to
betray
him
and
rend
him
like
rats
in
a
sewer
.
Low-lived
dogs
!
*NL*
And
they
look
it
!
By
Christ
,
they
look
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
behaved
rightly
,
cried
Dante
.
They
obeyed
their
bishops
and
*NL*
their
priests
.
Honour
to
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
it
is
perfectly
dreadful
to
say
that
not
even
for
one
day
in
*NL*
the
year
,
said
Mrs
Dedalus
,
can
we
be
free
from
these
dreadful
*NL*
disputes
!
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Charles
raised
his
hands
mildly
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
now
,
come
now
,
come
now
!
Can
we
not
have
our
opinions
whatever
*NL*
they
are
without
this
bad
temper
and
this
bad
language
?
It
is
too
bad
*NL*
surely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Dedalus
spoke
to
Dante
in
a
low
voice
but
Dante
said
loudly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
will
not
say
nothing
.
I
will
defend
my
church
and
my
religion
when
*NL*
it
is
insulted
and
spit
on
by
renegade
catholics
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Casey
pushed
his
plate
rudely
into
the
middle
of
the
table
and
,
*NL*
resting
his
elbows
before
him
,
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
to
his
host
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
me
,
did
I
tell
you
that
story
about
a
very
famous
spit
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
did
not
,
John
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
then
,
said
Mr
Casey
,
it
is
a
most
instructive
story
.
It
happened
*NL*
not
long
ago
in
the
county
Wicklow
where
we
are
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
off
and
,
turning
towards
Dante
,
said
with
quiet
indignation
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
I
may
tell
you
,
ma'am
,
that
I
,
if
you
mean
me
,
am
no
renegade
*NL*
catholic
.
I
am
a
catholic
as
my
father
was
and
his
father
before
him
*NL*
and
his
father
before
him
again
,
when
we
gave
up
our
lives
rather
than
*NL*
sell
our
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
more
shame
to
you
now
,
Dante
said
,
to
speak
as
you
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
story
,
John
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
smiling
.
Let
us
have
the
story
*NL*
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Catholic
indeed
!
repeated
Dante
ironically
.
The
blackest
protestant
*NL*
in
the
land
would
not
speak
the
language
I
have
heard
this
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
began
to
sway
his
head
to
and
fro
,
crooning
like
a
country
*NL*
singer
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
no
protestant
,
I
tell
you
again
,
said
Mr
Casey
,
flushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
,
still
crooning
and
swaying
his
head
,
began
to
sing
in
a
*NL*
grunting
nasal
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
O
,
come
all
you
Roman
catholics
*NL*
That
never
went
to
mass
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
up
his
knife
and
fork
again
in
good
humour
and
set
to
eating
,
*NL*
saying
to
Mr
Casey
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
us
have
the
story
,
John
.
It
will
help
us
to
digest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
looked
with
affection
at
Mr
Casey
's
face
which
stared
across
*NL*
the
table
over
his
joined
hands
.
He
liked
to
sit
near
him
at
the
fire
,
*NL*
looking
up
at
his
dark
fierce
face
.
But
his
dark
eyes
were
never
fierce
*NL*
and
his
slow
voice
was
good
to
listen
to
.
But
why
was
he
then
against
*NL*
the
priests
?
Because
Dante
must
be
right
then
.
But
he
had
heard
his
*NL*
father
say
that
she
was
a
spoiled
nun
and
that
she
had
come
out
of
the
*NL*
convent
in
the
Alleghanies
when
her
brother
had
got
the
money
from
the
*NL*
savages
for
the
trinkets
and
the
chainies
.
Perhaps
that
made
her
severe
*NL*
against
Parnell
.
And
she
did
not
like
him
to
play
with
Eileen
because
*NL*
Eileen
was
a
protestant
and
when
she
was
young
she
knew
children
that
*NL*
used
to
play
with
protestants
and
the
protestants
used
to
make
fun
of
*NL*
the
litany
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
.
TOWER
OF
IVORY
,
they
used
to
say
,
*NL*
HOUSE
OF
GOLD
!
How
could
a
woman
be
a
tower
of
ivory
or
a
house
of
*NL*
gold
?
Who
was
right
then
?
And
he
remembered
the
evening
in
the
*NL*
infirmary
in
Clongowes
,
the
dark
waters
,
the
light
at
the
pierhead
and
*NL*
the
moan
of
sorrow
from
the
people
when
they
had
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eileen
had
long
white
hands
.
One
evening
when
playing
tig
she
had
put
*NL*
her
hands
over
his
eyes
:
long
and
white
and
thin
and
cold
and
soft
.
*NL*
That
was
ivory
:
a
cold
white
thing
.
That
was
the
meaning
of
TOWER
OF
*NL*
IVORY
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
story
is
very
short
and
sweet
,
Mr
Casey
said
.
It
was
one
day
*NL*
down
in
Arklow
,
a
cold
bitter
day
,
not
long
before
the
chief
died
.
May
*NL*
God
have
mercy
on
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
eyes
wearily
and
paused
.
Mr
Dedalus
took
a
bone
from
his
*NL*
plate
and
tore
some
meat
from
it
with
his
teeth
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Before
he
was
killed
,
you
mean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Casey
opened
his
eyes
,
sighed
and
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
was
down
in
Arklow
one
day
.
We
were
down
there
at
a
meeting
and
*NL*
after
the
meeting
was
over
we
had
to
make
our
way
to
the
railway
*NL*
station
through
the
crowd
.
Such
booing
and
baaing
,
man
,
you
never
*NL*
heard
.
They
called
us
all
the
names
in
the
world
.
Well
there
was
one
*NL*
old
lady
,
and
a
drunken
old
harridan
she
was
surely
,
that
paid
all
her
*NL*
attention
to
me
.
She
kept
dancing
along
beside
me
in
the
mud
bawling
*NL*
and
screaming
into
my
face
:
PRIEST-HUNTER
!
THE
PARIS
FUNDS
!
MR
FOX
!
*NL*
KITTY
O'SHEA
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
what
did
you
do
,
John
?
asked
Mr
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
let
her
bawl
away
,
said
Mr
Casey
.
It
was
a
cold
day
and
to
keep
up
*NL*
my
heart
I
had
-LRB-
saving
your
presence
,
ma'am
-RRB-
a
quid
of
Tullamore
in
my
*NL*
mouth
and
sure
I
could
n't
say
a
word
in
any
case
because
my
mouth
was
*NL*
full
of
tobacco
juice
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
John
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
.
I
let
her
bawl
away
,
to
her
heart
's
content
,
KITTY
O'SHEA
and
*NL*
the
rest
of
it
till
at
last
she
called
that
lady
a
name
that
I
wo
n't
*NL*
sully
this
Christmas
board
nor
your
ears
,
ma'am
,
nor
my
own
lips
by
*NL*
repeating
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
.
Mr
Dedalus
,
lifting
his
head
from
the
bone
,
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
what
did
you
do
,
John
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
!
said
Mr
Casey
.
She
stuck
her
ugly
old
face
up
at
me
when
she
*NL*
said
it
and
I
had
my
mouth
full
of
tobacco
juice
.
I
bent
down
to
her
*NL*
and
PHTH
!
says
I
to
her
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
aside
and
made
the
act
of
spitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
PHTH
!
says
I
to
her
like
that
,
right
into
her
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
clapped
his
hand
to
his
eye
and
gave
a
hoarse
scream
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
JESUS
,
MARY
AND
JOSEPH
!
says
she
.
I
'M
BLINDED
!
I
'M
BLINDED
AND
*NL*
DROWNDED
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
in
a
fit
of
coughing
and
laughter
,
repeating
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'M
BLINDED
ENTIRELY
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
laughed
loudly
and
lay
back
in
his
chair
while
uncle
Charles
*NL*
swayed
his
head
to
and
fro
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dante
looked
terribly
angry
and
repeated
while
they
laughed
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Very
nice
!
Ha
!
Very
nice
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
nice
about
the
spit
in
the
woman
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
was
the
name
the
woman
had
called
Kitty
O'Shea
that
Mr
Casey
*NL*
would
not
repeat
?
He
thought
of
Mr
Casey
walking
through
the
crowds
of
*NL*
people
and
making
speeches
from
a
wagonette
.
That
was
what
he
had
been
*NL*
in
prison
for
and
he
remembered
that
one
night
Sergeant
O'Neill
had
*NL*
come
to
the
house
and
had
stood
in
the
hall
,
talking
in
a
low
voice
*NL*
with
his
father
and
chewing
nervously
at
the
chinstrap
of
his
cap
.
And
*NL*
that
night
Mr
Casey
had
not
gone
to
Dublin
by
train
but
a
car
had
come
*NL*
to
the
door
and
he
had
heard
his
father
say
something
about
the
*NL*
Cabinteely
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
for
Ireland
and
Parnell
and
so
was
his
father
:
and
so
was
Dante
*NL*
too
for
one
night
at
the
band
on
the
esplanade
she
had
hit
a
gentleman
*NL*
on
the
head
with
her
umbrella
because
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
when
the
*NL*
band
played
GOD
SAVE
THE
QUEEN
at
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
gave
a
snort
of
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
,
John
,
he
said
.
It
is
true
for
them
.
We
are
an
unfortunate
*NL*
priest-ridden
race
and
always
were
and
always
will
be
till
the
end
of
*NL*
the
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Charles
shook
his
head
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
bad
business
!
A
bad
business
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
priest-ridden
Godforsaken
race
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
pointed
to
the
portrait
of
his
grandfather
on
the
wall
to
his
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
see
that
old
chap
up
there
,
John
?
he
said
.
He
was
a
good
*NL*
Irishman
when
there
was
no
money
in
the
job
.
He
was
condemned
to
death
*NL*
as
a
whiteboy
.
But
he
had
a
saying
about
our
clerical
friends
,
that
he
*NL*
would
never
let
one
of
them
put
his
two
feet
under
his
mahogany
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dante
broke
in
angrily
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
we
are
a
priest-ridden
race
we
ought
to
be
proud
of
it
!
They
are
the
*NL*
apple
of
God
's
eye
.
TOUCH
THEM
NOT
,
says
Christ
,
FOR
THEY
ARE
THE
APPLE
*NL*
OF
MY
EYE
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
can
we
not
love
our
country
then
?
asked
Mr
Casey
.
Are
we
not
to
*NL*
follow
the
man
that
was
born
to
lead
us
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
traitor
to
his
country
!
replied
Dante
.
A
traitor
,
an
adulterer
!
*NL*
The
priests
were
right
to
abandon
him
.
The
priests
were
always
the
true
*NL*
friends
of
Ireland
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Were
they
,
faith
?
said
Mr
Casey
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
his
fist
on
the
table
and
,
frowning
angrily
,
protruded
one
*NL*
finger
after
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
n't
the
bishops
of
Ireland
betray
us
in
the
time
of
the
union
*NL*
when
Bishop
Lanigan
presented
an
address
of
loyalty
to
the
Marquess
*NL*
Cornwallis
?
Did
n't
the
bishops
and
priests
sell
the
aspirations
of
*NL*
their
country
in
1829
in
return
for
catholic
emancipation
?
Did
n't
they
*NL*
denounce
the
fenian
movement
from
the
pulpit
and
in
the
confession
box
?
*NL*
And
did
n't
they
dishonour
the
ashes
of
Terence
Bellew
MacManus
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
was
glowing
with
anger
and
Stephen
felt
the
glow
rise
to
his
*NL*
own
cheek
as
the
spoken
words
thrilled
him
.
Mr
Dedalus
uttered
a
guffaw
*NL*
of
coarse
scorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
by
God
,
he
cried
,
I
forgot
little
old
Paul
Cullen
!
Another
apple
*NL*
of
God
's
eye
!
*NL*
*NL*
Dante
bent
across
the
table
and
cried
to
Mr
Casey
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Right
!
Right
!
They
were
always
right
!
God
and
morality
and
religion
*NL*
come
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Dedalus
,
seeing
her
excitement
,
said
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mrs
Riordan
,
do
n't
excite
yourself
answering
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
and
religion
before
everything
!
Dante
cried
.
God
and
religion
*NL*
before
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Casey
raised
his
clenched
fist
and
brought
it
down
on
the
table
with
*NL*
a
crash
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Very
well
then
,
he
shouted
hoarsely
,
if
it
comes
to
that
,
no
God
for
*NL*
Ireland
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
John
!
John
!
cried
Mr
Dedalus
,
seizing
his
guest
by
the
coat
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dante
stared
across
the
table
,
her
cheeks
shaking
.
Mr
Casey
struggled
*NL*
up
from
his
chair
and
bent
across
the
table
towards
her
,
scraping
the
*NL*
air
from
before
his
eyes
with
one
hand
as
though
he
were
tearing
aside
*NL*
a
cobweb
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
God
for
Ireland
!
he
cried
.
We
have
had
too
much
God
In
Ireland
.
*NL*
Away
with
God
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Blasphemer
!
Devil
!
screamed
Dante
,
starting
to
her
feet
and
almost
*NL*
spitting
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Charles
and
Mr
Dedalus
pulled
Mr
Casey
back
into
his
chair
again
,
*NL*
talking
to
him
from
both
sides
reasonably
.
He
stared
before
him
out
of
*NL*
his
dark
flaming
eyes
,
repeating
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Away
with
God
,
I
say
!
*NL*
*NL*
Dante
shoved
her
chair
violently
aside
and
left
the
table
,
upsetting
*NL*
her
napkin-ring
which
rolled
slowly
along
the
carpet
and
came
to
rest
*NL*
against
the
foot
of
an
easy-chair
.
Mrs
Dedalus
rose
quickly
and
*NL*
followed
her
towards
the
door
.
At
the
door
Dante
turned
round
violently
*NL*
and
shouted
down
the
room
,
her
cheeks
flushed
and
quivering
with
rage
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Devil
out
of
hell
!
We
won
!
We
crushed
him
to
death
!
Fiend
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
slammed
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Casey
,
freeing
his
arms
from
his
holders
,
suddenly
bowed
his
head
on
*NL*
his
hands
with
a
sob
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Poor
Parnell
!
he
cried
loudly
.
My
dead
king
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
sobbed
loudly
and
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
raising
his
terror-stricken
face
,
saw
that
his
father
's
eyes
*NL*
were
full
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellows
talked
together
in
little
groups
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
fellow
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
were
caught
near
the
Hill
of
Lyons
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
caught
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mr
Gleeson
and
the
minister
.
They
were
on
a
car
.
The
same
fellow
*NL*
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
fellow
in
the
higher
line
told
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fleming
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
why
did
they
run
away
,
tell
us
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
why
,
Cecil
Thunder
said
.
Because
they
had
fecked
cash
out
of
*NL*
the
rector
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
fecked
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Kickham
's
brother
.
And
they
all
went
shares
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
that
was
stealing
.
How
could
they
have
done
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
fat
lot
you
know
about
it
,
Thunder
!
Wells
said
.
I
know
why
they
*NL*
scut
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
us
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
was
told
not
to
,
Wells
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
go
on
,
Wells
,
all
said
.
You
might
tell
us
.
We
wo
n't
let
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
bent
forward
his
head
to
hear
.
Wells
looked
round
to
see
if
*NL*
anyone
was
coming
.
Then
he
said
secretly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
know
the
altar
wine
they
keep
in
the
press
in
the
sacristy
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
they
drank
that
and
it
was
found
out
who
did
it
by
the
smell
.
*NL*
And
that
's
why
they
ran
away
,
if
you
want
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
fellow
who
had
spoken
first
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
that
's
what
I
heard
too
from
the
fellow
in
the
higher
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellows
all
were
silent
.
Stephen
stood
among
them
,
afraid
to
speak
,
*NL*
listening
.
A
faint
sickness
of
awe
made
him
feel
weak
.
How
could
they
*NL*
have
done
that
?
He
thought
of
the
dark
silent
sacristy
.
There
were
dark
*NL*
wooden
presses
there
where
the
crimped
surplices
lay
quietly
folded
.
It
*NL*
was
not
the
chapel
but
still
you
had
to
speak
under
your
breath
.
It
was
*NL*
a
holy
place
.
He
remembered
the
summer
evening
he
had
been
there
to
be
*NL*
dressed
as
boatbearer
,
the
evening
of
the
Procession
to
the
little
*NL*
altar
in
the
wood
.
A
strange
and
holy
place
.
The
boy
that
held
the
*NL*
censer
had
swung
it
lifted
by
the
middle
chain
to
keep
the
coals
*NL*
lighting
.
That
was
called
charcoal
:
and
it
had
burned
quietly
as
the
*NL*
fellow
had
swung
it
gently
and
had
given
off
a
weak
sour
smell
.
And
*NL*
then
when
all
were
vested
he
had
stood
holding
out
the
boat
to
the
*NL*
rector
and
the
rector
had
put
a
spoonful
of
incense
in
it
and
it
had
*NL*
hissed
on
the
red
coals
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellows
were
talking
together
in
little
groups
here
and
there
on
*NL*
the
playground
.
The
fellows
seemed
to
him
to
have
grown
smaller
:
that
*NL*
was
because
a
sprinter
had
knocked
him
down
the
day
before
,
a
fellow
*NL*
out
of
second
of
grammar
.
He
had
been
thrown
by
the
fellow
's
machine
*NL*
lightly
on
the
cinder
path
and
his
spectacles
had
been
broken
in
three
*NL*
pieces
and
some
of
the
grit
of
the
cinders
had
gone
into
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
why
the
fellows
seemed
to
him
smaller
and
farther
away
and
the
*NL*
goalposts
so
thin
and
far
and
the
soft
grey
sky
so
high
up
.
But
there
*NL*
was
no
play
on
the
football
grounds
for
cricket
was
coming
:
and
some
*NL*
said
that
Barnes
would
be
prof
and
some
said
it
would
be
Flowers
.
And
*NL*
all
over
the
playgrounds
they
were
playing
rounders
and
bowling
*NL*
twisters
and
lobs
.
And
from
here
and
from
there
came
the
sounds
of
the
*NL*
cricket
bats
through
the
soft
grey
air
.
They
said
:
pick
,
pack
,
pock
,
*NL*
puck
:
little
drops
of
water
in
a
fountain
slowly
falling
in
the
*NL*
brimming
bowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athy
,
who
had
been
silent
,
said
quietly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
are
all
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
turned
towards
him
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
know
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
told
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
us
,
Athy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athy
pointed
across
the
playground
to
where
Simon
Moonan
was
walking
by
*NL*
himself
kicking
a
stone
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ask
him
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellows
looked
there
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
he
in
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Athy
lowered
his
voice
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
know
why
those
fellows
scut
?
I
will
tell
you
but
you
must
not
*NL*
let
on
you
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
us
,
Athy
.
Go
on
.
You
might
if
you
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
said
mysteriously
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
were
caught
with
Simon
Moonan
and
Tusker
Boyle
in
the
square
one
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellows
looked
at
him
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Caught
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
doing
?
*NL*
*NL*
Athy
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Smugging
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
fellows
were
silent
:
and
Athy
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
that
's
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
looked
at
the
faces
of
the
fellows
but
they
were
all
looking
*NL*
across
the
playground
.
He
wanted
to
ask
somebody
about
it
.
What
did
*NL*
that
mean
about
the
smugging
in
the
square
?
Why
did
the
five
fellows
*NL*
out
of
the
higher
line
run
away
for
that
?
It
was
a
joke
,
he
thought
.
*NL*
Simon
Moonan
had
nice
clothes
and
one
night
he
had
shown
him
a
ball
of
*NL*
creamy
sweets
that
the
fellows
of
the
football
fifteen
had
rolled
down
*NL*
to
him
along
the
carpet
in
the
middle
of
the
refectory
when
he
was
at
*NL*
the
door
.
It
was
the
night
of
the
match
against
the
Bective
Rangers
;
*NL*
and
the
ball
was
made
just
like
a
red
and
green
apple
only
it
opened
*NL*
and
it
was
full
of
the
creamy
sweets
.
And
one
day
Boyle
had
said
that
*NL*
an
elephant
had
two
tuskers
instead
of
two
tusks
and
that
was
why
he
*NL*
was
called
Tusker
Boyle
but
some
fellows
called
him
Lady
Boyle
because
*NL*
he
was
always
at
his
nails
,
paring
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eileen
had
long
thin
cool
white
hands
too
because
she
was
a
girl
.
They
*NL*
were
like
ivory
;
only
soft
.
That
was
the
meaning
of
TOWER
OF
IVORY
but
*NL*
protestants
could
not
understand
it
and
made
fun
of
it
.
One
day
he
had
*NL*
stood
beside
her
looking
into
the
hotel
grounds
.
A
waiter
was
running
*NL*
up
a
trail
of
bunting
on
the
flagstaff
and
a
fox
terrier
was
scampering
*NL*
to
and
fro
on
the
sunny
lawn
.
She
had
put
her
hand
into
his
pocket
*NL*
where
his
hand
was
and
he
had
felt
how
cool
and
thin
and
soft
her
hand
*NL*
was
.
She
had
said
that
pockets
were
funny
things
to
have
:
and
then
all
*NL*
of
a
sudden
she
had
broken
away
and
had
run
laughing
down
the
sloping
*NL*
curve
of
the
path
.
Her
fair
hair
had
streamed
out
behind
her
like
gold
*NL*
in
the
sun
.
TOWER
OF
IVORY
.
HOUSE
OF
GOLD
.
By
thinking
of
things
you
*NL*
could
understand
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
why
in
the
square
?
You
went
there
when
you
wanted
to
do
something
.
*NL*
It
was
all
thick
slabs
of
slate
and
water
trickled
all
day
out
of
tiny
*NL*
pinholes
and
there
was
a
queer
smell
of
stale
water
there
.
And
behind
*NL*
the
door
of
one
of
the
closets
there
was
a
drawing
in
red
pencil
of
a
*NL*
bearded
man
in
a
Roman
dress
with
a
brick
in
each
hand
and
underneath
*NL*
was
the
name
of
the
drawing
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Balbus
was
building
a
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Some
fellow
had
drawn
it
there
for
a
cod
.
It
had
a
funny
face
but
it
*NL*
was
very
like
a
man
with
a
beard
.
And
on
the
wall
of
another
closet
*NL*
there
was
written
in
backhand
in
beautiful
writing
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Julius
Caesar
wrote
The
Calico
Belly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
that
was
why
they
were
there
because
it
was
a
place
where
some
*NL*
fellows
wrote
things
for
cod
.
But
all
the
same
it
was
queer
what
Athy
*NL*
said
and
the
way
he
said
it
.
It
was
not
a
cod
because
they
had
run
*NL*
away
.
He
looked
with
the
others
across
the
playground
and
began
to
feel
*NL*
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Fleming
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
we
are
all
to
be
punished
for
what
other
fellows
did
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
wo
n't
come
back
,
see
if
I
do
,
Cecil
Thunder
said
.
Three
days
'
silence
*NL*
in
the
refectory
and
sending
us
up
for
six
and
eight
every
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
said
Wells
.
And
old
Barrett
has
a
new
way
of
twisting
the
note
*NL*
so
that
you
ca
n't
open
it
and
fold
it
again
to
see
how
many
ferulae
you
*NL*
are
to
get
.
I
wo
n't
come
back
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
said
Cecil
Thunder
,
and
the
prefect
of
studies
was
in
second
of
*NL*
grammar
this
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
us
get
up
a
rebellion
,
Fleming
said
.
Will
we
?
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
fellows
were
silent
.
The
air
was
very
silent
and
you
could
hear
*NL*
the
cricket
bats
but
more
slowly
than
before
:
pick
,
pock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wells
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
going
to
be
done
to
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Simon
Moonan
and
Tusker
are
going
to
be
flogged
,
Athy
said
,
and
the
*NL*
fellows
in
the
higher
line
got
their
choice
of
flogging
or
being
*NL*
expelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
which
are
they
taking
?
asked
the
fellow
who
had
spoken
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
All
are
taking
expulsion
except
Corrigan
,
Athy
answered
.
He
's
going
*NL*
to
be
flogged
by
Mr
Gleeson
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
why
,
Cecil
Thunder
said
.
He
is
right
and
the
other
fellows
*NL*
are
wrong
because
a
flogging
wears
off
after
a
bit
but
a
fellow
that
*NL*
has
been
expelled
from
college
is
known
all
his
life
on
account
of
it
.
*NL*
Besides
Gleeson
wo
n't
flog
him
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
best
of
his
play
not
to
,
Fleming
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
would
n't
like
to
be
Simon
Moonan
and
Tusker
,
Cecil
Thunder
said
.
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
believe
they
will
be
flogged
.
Perhaps
they
will
be
sent
up
*NL*
for
twice
nine
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
no
,
said
Athy
.
They
'll
both
get
it
on
the
vital
spot
.
Wells
*NL*
rubbed
himself
and
said
in
a
crying
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Please
,
sir
,
let
me
off
!
*NL*
*NL*
Athy
grinned
and
turned
up
the
sleeves
of
his
jacket
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
It
ca
n't
be
helped
;
*NL*
It
must
be
done
.
*NL*
So
down
with
your
breeches
*NL*
And
out
with
your
bum
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellows
laughed
;
but
he
felt
that
they
were
a
little
afraid
.
In
the
*NL*
silence
of
the
soft
grey
air
he
heard
the
cricket
bats
from
here
and
*NL*
from
there
:
pock
.
That
was
a
sound
to
hear
but
if
you
were
hit
then
you
*NL*
would
feel
a
pain
.
The
pandybat
made
a
sound
too
but
not
like
that
.
The
*NL*
fellows
said
it
was
made
of
whalebone
and
leather
with
lead
inside
:
and
*NL*
he
wondered
what
was
the
pain
like
.
There
were
different
kinds
of
*NL*
sounds
.
A
long
thin
cane
would
have
a
high
whistling
sound
and
he
*NL*
wondered
what
was
that
pain
like
.
It
made
him
shivery
to
think
of
it
*NL*
and
cold
:
and
what
Athy
said
too
.
But
what
was
there
to
laugh
at
in
it
?
*NL*
It
made
him
shivery
:
but
that
was
because
you
always
felt
like
a
shiver
*NL*
when
you
let
down
your
trousers
.
It
was
the
same
in
the
bath
when
you
*NL*
undressed
yourself
.
He
wondered
who
had
to
let
them
down
,
the
master
or
*NL*
the
boy
himself
.
O
how
could
they
laugh
about
it
that
way
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
Athy
's
rolled-up
sleeves
and
knuckly
inky
hands
.
He
had
*NL*
rolled
up
his
sleeves
to
show
how
Mr
Gleeson
would
roll
up
his
sleeves
.
*NL*
But
Mr
Gleeson
had
round
shiny
cuffs
and
clean
white
wrists
and
fattish
*NL*
white
hands
and
the
nails
of
them
were
long
and
pointed
.
Perhaps
he
*NL*
pared
them
too
like
Lady
Boyle
.
But
they
were
terribly
long
and
pointed
*NL*
nails
.
So
long
and
cruel
they
were
,
though
the
white
fattish
hands
were
*NL*
not
cruel
but
gentle
.
And
though
he
trembled
with
cold
and
fright
to
*NL*
think
of
the
cruel
long
nails
and
of
the
high
whistling
sound
of
the
cane
*NL*
and
of
the
chill
you
felt
at
the
end
of
your
shirt
when
you
undressed
*NL*
yourself
yet
he
felt
a
feeling
of
queer
quiet
pleasure
inside
him
to
think
*NL*
of
the
white
fattish
hands
,
clean
and
strong
and
gentle
.
And
he
thought
of
*NL*
what
Cecil
Thunder
had
said
:
that
Mr
Gleeson
would
not
flog
Corrigan
hard
.
*NL*
And
Fleming
had
said
he
would
not
because
it
was
best
of
his
play
not
*NL*
to
.
But
that
was
not
why
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
from
far
out
on
the
playground
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
All
in
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
other
voices
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
All
in
!
All
in
!
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
writing
lesson
he
sat
with
his
arms
folded
,
listening
to
the
*NL*
slow
scraping
of
the
pens
.
Mr
Harford
went
to
and
fro
making
little
*NL*
signs
in
red
pencil
and
sometimes
sitting
beside
the
boy
to
show
him
*NL*
how
to
hold
his
pen
.
He
had
tried
to
spell
out
the
headline
for
himself
*NL*
though
he
knew
already
what
it
was
for
it
was
the
last
of
the
book
.
*NL*
ZEAL
WITHOUT
PRUDENCE
IS
LIKE
A
SHIP
ADRIFT
.
But
the
lines
of
the
*NL*
letters
were
like
fine
invisible
threads
and
it
was
only
by
closing
his
*NL*
right
eye
tight
and
staring
out
of
the
left
eye
that
he
could
make
out
*NL*
the
full
curves
of
the
capital
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr
Harford
was
very
decent
and
never
got
into
a
wax
.
All
the
other
*NL*
masters
got
into
dreadful
waxes
.
But
why
were
they
to
suffer
for
what
*NL*
fellows
in
the
higher
line
did
?
Wells
had
said
that
they
had
drunk
some
*NL*
of
the
altar
wine
out
of
the
press
in
the
sacristy
and
that
it
had
been
*NL*
found
out
who
had
done
it
by
the
smell
.
Perhaps
they
had
stolen
a
*NL*
monstrance
to
run
away
with
and
sell
it
somewhere
.
That
must
have
been
*NL*
a
terrible
sin
,
to
go
in
there
quietly
at
night
,
to
open
the
dark
press
*NL*
and
steal
the
flashing
gold
thing
into
which
God
was
put
on
the
altar
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
flowers
and
candles
at
benediction
while
the
incense
*NL*
went
up
in
clouds
at
both
sides
as
the
fellow
swung
the
censer
and
*NL*
Dominic
Kelly
sang
the
first
part
by
himself
in
the
choir
.
But
God
was
*NL*
not
in
it
of
course
when
they
stole
it
.
But
still
it
was
a
strange
and
*NL*
a
great
sin
even
to
touch
it
.
He
thought
of
it
with
deep
awe
;
a
*NL*
terrible
and
strange
sin
:
it
thrilled
him
to
think
of
it
in
the
silence
*NL*
when
the
pens
scraped
lightly
.
But
to
drink
the
altar
wine
out
of
the
*NL*
press
and
be
found
out
by
the
smell
was
a
sin
too
:
but
it
was
not
*NL*
terrible
and
strange
.
It
only
made
you
feel
a
little
sickish
on
account
*NL*
of
the
smell
of
the
wine
.
Because
on
the
day
when
he
had
made
his
first
*NL*
holy
communion
in
the
chapel
he
had
shut
his
eyes
and
opened
his
mouth
*NL*
and
put
out
his
tongue
a
little
:
and
when
the
rector
had
stooped
down
*NL*
to
give
him
the
holy
communion
he
had
smelt
a
faint
winy
smell
off
the
*NL*
rector
's
breath
after
the
wine
of
the
mass
.
The
word
was
beautiful
:
*NL*
wine
.
It
made
you
think
of
dark
purple
because
the
grapes
were
dark
*NL*
purple
that
grew
in
Greece
outside
houses
like
white
temples
.
But
the
*NL*
faint
smell
of
the
rector
's
breath
had
made
him
feel
a
sick
feeling
on
*NL*
the
morning
of
his
first
communion
.
The
day
of
your
first
communion
was
*NL*
the
happiest
day
of
your
life
.
And
once
a
lot
of
generals
had
asked
*NL*
Napoleon
what
was
the
happiest
day
of
his
life
.
They
thought
he
would
*NL*
say
the
day
he
won
some
great
battle
or
the
day
he
was
made
an
emperor
.
*NL*
But
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Gentlemen
,
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
was
the
day
on
which
I
made
*NL*
my
first
holy
communion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Arnall
came
in
and
the
Latin
lesson
began
and
he
remained
still
,
*NL*
leaning
on
the
desk
with
his
arms
folded
.
Father
Arnall
gave
out
the
*NL*
theme-books
and
he
said
that
they
were
scandalous
and
that
they
were
*NL*
all
to
be
written
out
again
with
the
corrections
at
once
.
But
the
worst
*NL*
of
all
was
Fleming
's
theme
because
the
pages
were
stuck
together
by
a
*NL*
blot
:
and
Father
Arnall
held
it
up
by
a
corner
and
said
it
was
an
*NL*
insult
to
any
master
to
send
him
up
such
a
theme
.
Then
he
asked
Jack
*NL*
Lawton
to
decline
the
noun
MARE
and
Jack
Lawton
stopped
at
the
ablative
*NL*
singular
and
could
not
go
on
with
the
plural
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
,
said
Father
Arnall
sternly
.
You
,
*NL*
the
leader
of
the
class
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
asked
the
next
boy
and
the
next
and
the
next
.
Nobody
knew
.
*NL*
Father
Arnall
became
very
quiet
,
more
and
more
quiet
as
each
boy
tried
*NL*
to
answer
it
and
could
not
.
But
his
face
was
black-looking
and
*NL*
his
eyes
were
staring
though
his
voice
was
so
quiet
.
Then
he
asked
*NL*
Fleming
and
Fleming
said
that
the
word
had
no
plural
.
Father
Arnall
*NL*
suddenly
shut
the
book
and
shouted
at
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Kneel
out
there
in
the
middle
of
the
class
.
You
are
one
of
the
*NL*
idlest
boys
I
ever
met
.
Copy
out
your
themes
again
the
rest
of
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fleming
moved
heavily
out
of
his
place
and
knelt
between
the
two
last
*NL*
benches
.
The
other
boys
bent
over
their
theme-books
and
began
to
write
.
*NL*
A
silence
filled
the
classroom
and
Stephen
,
glancing
timidly
at
Father
*NL*
Arnall
's
dark
face
,
saw
that
it
was
a
little
red
from
the
wax
he
was
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
that
a
sin
for
Father
Arnall
to
be
in
a
wax
or
was
he
allowed
to
*NL*
get
into
a
wax
when
the
boys
were
idle
because
that
made
them
study
*NL*
better
or
was
he
only
letting
on
to
be
in
a
wax
?
It
was
because
he
was
*NL*
allowed
,
because
a
priest
would
know
what
a
sin
was
and
would
not
do
*NL*
it
.
But
if
he
did
it
one
time
by
mistake
what
would
he
do
to
go
to
*NL*
confession
?
Perhaps
he
would
go
to
confession
to
the
minister
.
And
if
*NL*
the
minister
did
it
he
would
go
to
the
rector
:
and
the
rector
to
the
*NL*
provincial
:
and
the
provincial
to
the
general
of
the
jesuits
.
That
was
*NL*
called
the
order
:
and
he
had
heard
his
father
say
that
they
were
all
*NL*
clever
men
.
They
could
all
have
become
high-up
people
in
the
world
if
*NL*
they
had
not
become
jesuits
.
And
he
wondered
what
Father
Arnall
and
*NL*
Paddy
Barrett
would
have
become
and
what
Mr
McGlade
and
Mr
Gleeson
*NL*
would
have
become
if
they
had
not
become
jesuits
.
It
was
hard
to
think
*NL*
what
because
you
would
have
to
think
of
them
in
a
different
way
with
*NL*
different
coloured
coats
and
trousers
and
with
beards
and
moustaches
*NL*
and
different
kinds
of
hats
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
quietly
and
closed
.
A
quick
whisper
ran
through
the
*NL*
class
:
the
prefect
of
studies
.
There
was
an
instant
of
dead
silence
and
*NL*
then
the
loud
crack
of
a
pandybat
on
the
last
desk
.
Stephen
's
heart
*NL*
leapt
up
in
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Any
boys
want
flogging
here
,
Father
Arnall
?
cried
the
prefect
of
*NL*
studies
.
Any
lazy
idle
loafers
that
want
flogging
in
this
class
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
to
the
middle
of
the
class
and
saw
Fleming
on
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hoho
!
he
cried
.
Who
is
this
boy
?
Why
is
he
on
his
knees
?
What
is
*NL*
your
name
,
boy
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Fleming
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hoho
,
Fleming
!
An
idler
of
course
.
I
can
see
it
in
your
eye
.
Why
is
*NL*
he
on
his
knees
,
Father
Arnall
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
wrote
a
bad
Latin
theme
,
Father
Arnall
said
,
and
he
missed
all
*NL*
the
questions
in
grammar
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
course
he
did
!
cried
the
prefect
of
studies
,
of
course
he
did
!
A
*NL*
born
idler
!
I
can
see
it
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
banged
his
pandybat
down
on
the
desk
and
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Up
,
Fleming
!
Up
,
my
boy
!
*NL*
*NL*
Fleming
stood
up
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hold
out
!
cried
the
prefect
of
studies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fleming
held
out
his
hand
.
The
pandybat
came
down
on
it
with
a
loud
*NL*
smacking
sound
:
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
,
six
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Other
hand
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
pandybat
came
down
again
in
six
loud
quick
smacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Kneel
down
!
cried
the
prefect
of
studies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fleming
knelt
down
,
squeezing
his
hands
under
his
armpits
,
his
face
*NL*
contorted
with
pain
;
but
Stephen
knew
how
hard
his
hands
were
because
*NL*
Fleming
was
always
rubbing
rosin
into
them
.
But
perhaps
he
was
in
great
*NL*
pain
for
the
noise
of
the
pandybat
was
terrible
.
Stephen
's
heart
was
*NL*
beating
and
fluttering
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
At
your
work
,
all
of
you
!
shouted
the
prefect
of
studies
.
We
want
no
*NL*
lazy
idle
loafers
here
,
lazy
idle
little
schemers
.
At
your
work
,
I
tell
*NL*
you
.
Father
Dolan
will
be
in
to
see
you
every
day
.
Father
Dolan
will
be
*NL*
in
tomorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
poked
one
of
the
boys
in
the
side
with
his
pandybat
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
,
boy
!
When
will
Father
Dolan
be
in
again
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tomorrow
,
sir
,
said
Tom
Furlong
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tomorrow
and
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
,
said
the
prefect
of
studies
.
*NL*
Make
up
your
minds
for
that
.
Every
day
Father
Dolan
.
Write
away
.
You
,
*NL*
boy
,
who
are
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
's
heart
jumped
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dedalus
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
are
you
not
writing
like
the
others
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I.
.
.
my
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
speak
with
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
is
he
not
writing
,
Father
Arnall
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
broke
his
glasses
,
said
Father
Arnall
,
and
I
exempted
him
from
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Broke
?
What
is
this
I
hear
?
What
is
this
?
Your
name
is
!
said
the
*NL*
prefect
of
studies
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dedalus
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Out
here
,
Dedalus
.
Lazy
little
schemer
.
I
see
schemer
in
your
face
.
*NL*
Where
did
you
break
your
glasses
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
stumbled
into
the
middle
of
the
class
,
blinded
by
fear
and
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
did
you
break
your
glasses
?
repeated
the
prefect
of
studies
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
cinder-path
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hoho
!
The
cinder-path
!
cried
the
prefect
of
studies
.
I
know
that
trick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
lifted
his
eyes
in
wonder
and
saw
for
a
moment
Father
Dolan
's
*NL*
white-grey
not
young
face
,
his
baldy
white-grey
head
with
fluff
at
the
*NL*
sides
of
it
,
the
steel
rims
of
his
spectacles
and
his
no-coloured
eyes
*NL*
looking
through
the
glasses
.
Why
did
he
say
he
knew
that
trick
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Lazy
idle
little
loafer
!
cried
the
prefect
of
studies
.
Broke
my
*NL*
glasses
!
An
old
schoolboy
trick
!
Out
with
your
hand
this
moment
!
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
closed
his
eyes
and
held
out
in
the
air
his
trembling
hand
with
*NL*
the
palm
upwards
.
He
felt
the
prefect
of
studies
touch
it
for
a
moment
*NL*
at
the
fingers
to
straighten
it
and
then
the
swish
of
the
sleeve
of
the
*NL*
soutane
as
the
pandybat
was
lifted
to
strike
.
A
hot
burning
stinging
*NL*
tingling
blow
like
the
loud
crack
of
a
broken
stick
made
his
trembling
*NL*
hand
crumple
together
like
a
leaf
in
the
fire
:
and
at
the
sound
and
the
*NL*
pain
scalding
tears
were
driven
into
his
eyes
.
His
whole
body
was
shaking
*NL*
with
fright
,
his
arm
was
shaking
and
his
crumpled
burning
livid
hand
shook
*NL*
like
a
loose
leaf
in
the
air
.
A
cry
sprang
to
his
lips
,
a
prayer
to
be
let
*NL*
off
.
But
though
the
tears
scalded
his
eyes
and
his
limbs
quivered
with
*NL*
pain
and
fright
he
held
back
the
hot
tears
and
the
cry
that
scalded
his
*NL*
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Other
hand
!
shouted
the
prefect
of
studies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
drew
back
his
maimed
and
quivering
right
arm
and
held
out
his
*NL*
left
hand
.
The
soutane
sleeve
swished
again
as
the
pandybat
was
lifted
*NL*
and
a
loud
crashing
sound
and
a
fierce
maddening
tingling
burning
pain
*NL*
made
his
hand
shrink
together
with
the
palms
and
fingers
in
a
livid
*NL*
quivering
mass
.
The
scalding
water
burst
forth
from
his
eyes
and
,
*NL*
burning
with
shame
and
agony
and
fear
,
he
drew
back
his
shaking
arm
in
*NL*
terror
and
burst
out
into
a
whine
of
pain
.
His
body
shook
with
a
palsy
*NL*
of
fright
and
in
shame
and
rage
he
felt
the
scalding
cry
come
from
his
*NL*
throat
and
the
scalding
tears
falling
out
of
his
eyes
and
down
his
*NL*
flaming
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Kneel
down
,
cried
the
prefect
of
studies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
knelt
down
quickly
pressing
his
beaten
hands
to
his
sides
.
To
*NL*
think
of
them
beaten
and
swollen
with
pain
all
in
a
moment
made
him
*NL*
feel
so
sorry
for
them
as
if
they
were
not
his
own
but
someone
else
's
*NL*
that
he
felt
sorry
for
.
And
as
he
knelt
,
calming
the
last
sobs
in
his
*NL*
throat
and
feeling
the
burning
tingling
pain
pressed
into
his
sides
,
he
*NL*
thought
of
the
hands
which
he
had
held
out
in
the
air
with
the
palms
up
*NL*
and
of
the
firm
touch
of
the
prefect
of
studies
when
he
had
steadied
*NL*
the
shaking
fingers
and
of
the
beaten
swollen
reddened
mass
of
palm
and
*NL*
fingers
that
shook
helplessly
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Get
at
your
work
,
all
of
you
,
cried
the
prefect
of
studies
from
the
*NL*
door
.
Father
Dolan
will
be
in
every
day
to
see
if
any
boy
,
any
lazy
*NL*
idle
little
loafer
wants
flogging
.
Every
day
.
Every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
closed
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hushed
class
continued
to
copy
out
the
themes
.
Father
Arnall
rose
*NL*
from
his
seat
and
went
among
them
,
helping
the
boys
with
gentle
words
*NL*
and
telling
them
the
mistakes
they
had
made
.
His
voice
was
very
gentle
*NL*
and
soft
.
Then
he
returned
to
his
seat
and
said
to
Fleming
and
Stephen
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
may
return
to
your
places
,
you
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fleming
and
Stephen
rose
and
,
walking
to
their
seats
,
sat
down
.
*NL*
Stephen
,
scarlet
with
shame
,
opened
a
book
quickly
with
one
weak
hand
*NL*
and
bent
down
upon
it
,
his
face
close
to
the
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
unfair
and
cruel
because
the
doctor
had
told
him
not
to
read
*NL*
without
glasses
and
he
had
written
home
to
his
father
that
morning
to
*NL*
send
him
a
new
pair
.
And
Father
Arnall
had
said
that
he
need
not
study
*NL*
till
the
new
glasses
came
.
Then
to
be
called
a
schemer
before
the
class
*NL*
and
to
be
pandied
when
he
always
got
the
card
for
first
or
second
and
*NL*
was
the
leader
of
the
Yorkists
!
How
could
the
prefect
of
studies
know
*NL*
that
it
was
a
trick
?
He
felt
the
touch
of
the
prefect
's
fingers
as
they
*NL*
had
steadied
his
hand
and
at
first
he
had
thought
he
was
going
to
shake
*NL*
hands
with
him
because
the
fingers
were
soft
and
firm
:
but
then
in
an
*NL*
instant
he
had
heard
the
swish
of
the
soutane
sleeve
and
the
crash
.
It
*NL*
was
cruel
and
unfair
to
make
him
kneel
in
the
middle
of
the
class
then
:
*NL*
and
Father
Arnall
had
told
them
both
that
they
might
return
to
their
*NL*
places
without
making
any
difference
between
them
.
He
listened
to
*NL*
Father
Arnall
's
low
and
gentle
voice
as
he
corrected
the
themes
.
*NL*
Perhaps
he
was
sorry
now
and
wanted
to
be
decent
.
But
it
was
unfair
and
*NL*
cruel
.
The
prefect
of
studies
was
a
priest
but
that
was
cruel
and
*NL*
unfair
.
And
his
white-grey
face
and
the
no-coloured
eyes
behind
the
*NL*
steel-rimmed
spectacles
were
cruel
looking
because
he
had
steadied
the
*NL*
hand
first
with
his
firm
soft
fingers
and
that
was
to
hit
it
better
and
*NL*
louder
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
a
stinking
mean
thing
,
that
's
what
it
is
,
said
Fleming
in
the
*NL*
corridor
as
the
classes
were
passing
out
in
file
to
the
refectory
,
to
*NL*
pandy
a
fellow
for
what
is
not
his
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
really
broke
your
glasses
by
accident
,
did
n't
you
?
Nasty
Roche
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
felt
his
heart
filled
by
Fleming
's
words
and
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
course
he
did
!
said
Fleming
.
I
would
n't
stand
it
.
I
'd
go
up
and
*NL*
tell
the
rector
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
said
Cecil
Thunder
eagerly
,
and
I
saw
him
lift
the
pandy-bat
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
and
he
's
not
allowed
to
do
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
they
hurt
you
much
?
Nasty
Roche
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Very
much
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
would
n't
stand
it
,
Fleming
repeated
,
from
Baldyhead
or
any
other
*NL*
Baldyhead
.
It
's
a
stinking
mean
low
trick
,
that
's
what
it
is
.
I
'd
go
*NL*
straight
up
to
the
rector
and
tell
him
about
it
after
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
do
.
Yes
,
do
,
said
Cecil
Thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
do
.
Yes
,
go
up
and
tell
the
rector
on
him
,
Dedalus
,
said
Nasty
*NL*
Roche
,
because
he
said
that
he
'd
come
in
tomorrow
again
and
pandy
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
yes
.
Tell
the
rector
,
all
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
were
some
fellows
out
of
second
of
grammar
listening
and
one
*NL*
of
them
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
senate
and
the
Roman
people
declared
that
Dedalus
had
been
*NL*
wrongly
punished
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
wrong
;
it
was
unfair
and
cruel
;
and
,
as
he
sat
in
the
refectory
,
*NL*
he
suffered
time
after
time
in
memory
the
same
humiliation
until
he
*NL*
began
to
wonder
whether
it
might
not
really
be
that
there
was
something
*NL*
in
his
face
which
made
him
look
like
a
schemer
and
he
wished
he
had
a
*NL*
little
mirror
to
see
.
But
there
could
not
be
;
and
it
was
unjust
and
*NL*
cruel
and
unfair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
eat
the
blackish
fish
fritters
they
got
on
Wednesdays
in
*NL*
lent
and
one
of
his
potatoes
had
the
mark
of
the
spade
in
it
.
Yes
,
he
*NL*
would
do
what
the
fellows
had
told
him
.
He
would
go
up
and
tell
the
*NL*
rector
that
he
had
been
wrongly
punished
.
A
thing
like
that
had
been
*NL*
done
before
by
somebody
in
history
,
by
some
great
person
whose
head
was
*NL*
in
the
books
of
history
.
And
the
rector
would
declare
that
he
had
been
*NL*
wrongly
punished
because
the
senate
and
the
Roman
people
always
*NL*
declared
that
the
men
who
did
that
had
been
wrongly
punished
.
Those
*NL*
were
the
great
men
whose
names
were
in
Richmal
Magnall
's
Questions
.
*NL*
History
was
all
about
those
men
and
what
they
did
and
that
was
what
*NL*
Peter
Parley
's
Tales
about
Greece
and
Rome
were
all
about
.
Peter
Parley
*NL*
himself
was
on
the
first
page
in
a
picture
.
There
was
a
road
over
a
*NL*
heath
with
grass
at
the
side
and
little
bushes
:
and
Peter
Parley
had
a
*NL*
broad
hat
like
a
protestant
minister
and
a
big
stick
and
he
was
walking
*NL*
fast
along
the
road
to
Greece
and
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
what
he
had
to
do
.
All
he
had
to
do
was
when
the
dinner
was
*NL*
over
and
he
came
out
in
his
turn
to
go
on
walking
but
not
out
to
the
*NL*
corridor
but
up
the
staircase
on
the
right
that
led
to
the
castle
.
He
*NL*
had
nothing
to
do
but
that
:
to
turn
to
the
right
and
walk
fast
up
the
*NL*
staircase
and
in
half
a
minute
he
would
be
in
the
low
dark
narrow
*NL*
corridor
that
led
through
the
castle
to
the
rector
's
room
.
And
every
*NL*
fellow
had
said
that
it
was
unfair
,
even
the
fellow
out
of
second
of
*NL*
grammar
who
had
said
that
about
the
senate
and
the
Roman
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
happen
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
the
fellows
of
the
higher
line
stand
up
at
the
top
of
the
*NL*
refectory
and
heard
their
steps
as
they
came
down
the
matting
:
Paddy
*NL*
Rath
and
Jimmy
Magee
and
the
Spaniard
and
the
Portuguese
and
the
fifth
*NL*
was
big
Corrigan
who
was
going
to
be
flogged
by
Mr
Gleeson
.
That
was
*NL*
why
the
prefect
of
studies
had
called
him
a
schemer
and
pandied
him
for
*NL*
nothing
:
and
,
straining
his
weak
eyes
,
tired
with
the
tears
,
he
watched
*NL*
big
Corrigan
's
broad
shoulders
and
big
hanging
black
head
passing
in
the
*NL*
file
.
But
he
had
done
something
and
besides
Mr
Gleeson
would
not
flog
him
*NL*
hard
:
and
he
remembered
how
big
Corrigan
looked
in
the
bath
.
He
had
skin
*NL*
the
same
colour
as
the
turf-coloured
bogwater
in
the
shallow
end
of
the
*NL*
bath
and
when
he
walked
along
the
side
his
feet
slapped
loudly
on
the
wet
*NL*
tiles
and
at
every
step
his
thighs
shook
a
little
because
he
was
fat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
refectory
was
half
empty
and
the
fellows
were
still
passing
out
in
*NL*
file
.
He
could
go
up
the
staircase
because
there
was
never
a
priest
or
*NL*
a
prefect
outside
the
refectory
door
.
But
he
could
not
go
.
The
rector
*NL*
would
side
with
the
prefect
of
studies
and
think
it
was
a
schoolboy
*NL*
trick
and
then
the
prefect
of
studies
would
come
in
every
day
the
same
,
*NL*
only
it
would
be
worse
because
he
would
be
dreadfully
waxy
at
any
*NL*
fellow
going
up
to
the
rector
about
him
.
The
fellows
had
told
him
to
go
*NL*
but
they
would
not
go
themselves
.
They
had
forgotten
all
about
it
.
No
,
*NL*
it
was
best
to
forget
all
about
it
and
perhaps
the
prefect
of
studies
*NL*
had
only
said
he
would
come
in
.
No
,
it
was
best
to
hide
out
of
the
way
*NL*
because
when
you
were
small
and
young
you
could
often
escape
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellows
at
his
table
stood
up
.
He
stood
up
and
passed
out
among
*NL*
them
in
the
file
.
He
had
to
decide
.
He
was
coming
near
the
door
.
If
he
*NL*
went
on
with
the
fellows
he
could
never
go
up
to
the
rector
because
he
*NL*
could
not
leave
the
playground
for
that
.
And
if
he
went
and
was
pandied
*NL*
all
the
same
all
the
fellows
would
make
fun
and
talk
about
young
*NL*
Dedalus
going
up
to
the
rector
to
tell
on
the
prefect
of
studies
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
walking
down
along
the
matting
and
he
saw
the
door
before
him
.
*NL*
It
was
impossible
:
he
could
not
.
He
thought
of
the
baldy
head
of
the
*NL*
prefect
of
studies
with
the
cruel
no-coloured
eyes
looking
at
him
and
*NL*
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
prefect
of
studies
asking
him
twice
what
his
*NL*
name
was
.
Why
could
he
not
remember
the
name
when
he
was
told
the
first
*NL*
time
?
Was
he
not
listening
the
first
time
or
was
it
to
make
fun
out
of
*NL*
the
name
?
The
great
men
in
the
history
had
names
like
that
and
nobody
*NL*
made
fun
of
them
.
It
was
his
own
name
that
he
should
have
made
fun
of
*NL*
if
he
wanted
to
make
fun
.
Dolan
:
it
was
like
the
name
of
a
woman
who
*NL*
washed
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
reached
the
door
and
,
turning
quickly
up
to
the
right
,
walked
up
*NL*
the
stairs
and
,
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
come
back
,
he
had
*NL*
entered
the
low
dark
narrow
corridor
that
led
to
the
castle
.
And
as
he
*NL*
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
door
of
the
corridor
he
saw
,
without
*NL*
turning
his
head
to
look
,
that
all
the
fellows
were
looking
after
him
*NL*
as
they
went
filing
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
along
the
narrow
dark
corridor
,
passing
little
doors
that
*NL*
were
the
doors
of
the
rooms
of
the
community
.
He
peered
in
front
of
him
*NL*
and
right
and
left
through
the
gloom
and
thought
that
those
must
be
*NL*
portraits
.
It
was
dark
and
silent
and
his
eyes
were
weak
and
tired
with
*NL*
tears
so
that
he
could
not
see
.
But
he
thought
they
were
the
portraits
*NL*
of
the
saints
and
great
men
of
the
order
who
were
looking
down
on
him
*NL*
silently
as
he
passed
:
saint
Ignatius
Loyola
holding
an
open
book
and
*NL*
pointing
to
the
words
AD
MAJOREM
DEI
GLORIAM
in
it
;
saint
Francis
*NL*
Xavier
pointing
to
his
chest
;
Lorenzo
Ricci
with
his
berretta
on
his
*NL*
head
like
one
of
the
prefects
of
the
lines
,
the
three
patrons
of
holy
*NL*
youth
--
saint
Stanislaus
Kostka
,
saint
Aloysius
Gonzago
,
and
Blessed
*NL*
John
Berchmans
,
all
with
young
faces
because
they
died
when
they
were
*NL*
young
,
and
Father
Peter
Kenny
sitting
in
a
chair
wrapped
in
a
big
*NL*
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
out
on
the
landing
above
the
entrance
hall
and
looked
about
*NL*
him
.
That
was
where
Hamilton
Rowan
had
passed
and
the
marks
of
the
*NL*
soldiers
'
slugs
were
there
.
And
it
was
there
that
the
old
servants
had
*NL*
seen
the
ghost
in
the
white
cloak
of
a
marshal
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
servant
was
sweeping
at
the
end
of
the
landing
.
He
asked
him
*NL*
where
was
the
rector
's
room
and
the
old
servant
pointed
to
the
door
at
*NL*
the
far
end
and
looked
after
him
as
he
went
on
to
it
and
knocked
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
.
He
knocked
again
more
loudly
and
his
heart
jumped
*NL*
when
he
heard
a
muffled
voice
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
in
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
the
handle
and
opened
the
door
and
fumbled
for
the
handle
of
*NL*
the
green
baize
door
inside
.
He
found
it
and
pushed
it
open
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
the
rector
sitting
at
a
desk
writing
.
There
was
a
skull
on
the
*NL*
desk
and
a
strange
solemn
smell
in
the
room
like
the
old
leather
of
*NL*
chairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
was
beating
fast
on
account
of
the
solemn
place
he
was
in
and
*NL*
the
silence
of
the
room
:
and
he
looked
at
the
skull
and
at
the
rector
's
*NL*
kind-looking
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
my
little
man
,
said
the
rector
,
what
is
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
swallowed
down
the
thing
in
his
throat
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
broke
my
glasses
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rector
opened
his
mouth
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
smiled
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
if
we
broke
our
glasses
we
must
write
home
for
a
new
pair
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
wrote
home
,
sir
,
said
Stephen
,
and
Father
Arnall
said
I
am
not
to
*NL*
study
till
they
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Quite
right
!
said
the
rector
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
swallowed
down
the
thing
again
and
tried
to
keep
his
legs
and
*NL*
his
voice
from
shaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
,
sir
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Father
Dolan
came
in
today
and
pandied
me
because
I
was
not
writing
*NL*
my
theme
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rector
looked
at
him
in
silence
and
he
could
feel
the
blood
rising
*NL*
to
his
face
and
the
tears
about
to
rise
to
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rector
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Your
name
is
Dedalus
,
is
n't
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
sir
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
where
did
you
break
your
glasses
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
On
the
cinder-path
,
sir
.
A
fellow
was
coming
out
of
the
bicycle
*NL*
house
and
I
fell
and
they
got
broken
.
I
do
n't
know
the
fellow
's
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rector
looked
at
him
again
in
silence
.
Then
he
smiled
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
well
,
it
was
a
mistake
;
I
am
sure
Father
Dolan
did
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
I
told
him
I
broke
them
,
sir
,
and
he
pandied
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
you
tell
him
that
you
had
written
home
for
a
new
pair
?
the
*NL*
rector
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
well
then
,
said
the
rector
,
Father
Dolan
did
not
understand
.
You
can
*NL*
say
that
I
excuse
you
from
your
lessons
for
a
few
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
said
quickly
for
fear
his
trembling
would
prevent
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
sir
,
but
Father
Dolan
said
he
will
come
in
tomorrow
to
pandy
me
*NL*
again
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Very
well
,
the
rector
said
,
it
is
a
mistake
and
I
shall
speak
to
*NL*
Father
Dolan
myself
.
Will
that
do
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
felt
the
tears
wetting
his
eyes
and
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
yes
sir
,
thanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rector
held
his
hand
across
the
side
of
the
desk
where
the
skull
*NL*
was
and
Stephen
,
placing
his
hand
in
it
for
a
moment
,
felt
a
cool
moist
*NL*
palm
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
day
now
,
said
the
rector
,
withdrawing
his
hand
and
bowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
day
,
sir
,
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
and
walked
quietly
out
of
the
room
,
closing
the
doors
*NL*
carefully
and
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
he
had
passed
the
old
servant
on
the
landing
and
was
again
in
*NL*
the
low
narrow
dark
corridor
he
began
to
walk
faster
and
faster
.
Faster
*NL*
and
faster
he
hurried
on
through
the
gloom
excitedly
.
He
bumped
his
*NL*
elbow
against
the
door
at
the
end
and
,
hurrying
down
the
staircase
,
*NL*
walked
quickly
through
the
two
corridors
and
out
into
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hear
the
cries
of
the
fellows
on
the
playgrounds
.
He
broke
*NL*
into
a
run
and
,
running
quicker
and
quicker
,
ran
across
the
cinderpath
*NL*
and
reached
the
third
line
playground
,
panting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellows
had
seen
him
running
.
They
closed
round
him
in
a
ring
,
*NL*
pushing
one
against
another
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
us
!
Tell
us
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
did
he
say
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
you
go
in
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
did
he
say
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
us
!
Tell
us
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
them
what
he
had
said
and
what
the
rector
had
said
and
,
when
he
*NL*
had
told
them
,
all
the
fellows
flung
their
caps
spinning
up
into
the
*NL*
air
and
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hurroo
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
caught
their
caps
and
sent
them
up
again
spinning
sky-high
and
*NL*
cried
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hurroo
!
Hurroo
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
a
cradle
of
their
locked
hands
and
hoisted
him
up
among
them
*NL*
and
carried
him
along
till
he
struggled
to
get
free
.
And
when
he
had
*NL*
escaped
from
them
they
broke
away
in
all
directions
,
flinging
their
*NL*
caps
again
into
the
air
and
whistling
as
they
went
spinning
up
and
*NL*
crying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hurroo
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
gave
three
groans
for
Baldyhead
Dolan
and
three
cheers
for
*NL*
Conmee
and
they
said
he
was
the
decentest
rector
that
was
ever
in
*NL*
Clongowes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cheers
died
away
in
the
soft
grey
air
.
He
was
alone
.
He
was
happy
*NL*
and
free
;
but
he
would
not
be
anyway
proud
with
Father
Dolan
.
He
would
*NL*
be
very
quiet
and
obedient
:
and
he
wished
that
he
could
do
something
*NL*
kind
for
him
to
show
him
that
he
was
not
proud
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
was
soft
and
grey
and
mild
and
evening
was
coming
.
There
was
*NL*
the
smell
of
evening
in
the
air
,
the
smell
of
the
fields
in
the
country
*NL*
where
they
digged
up
turnips
to
peel
them
and
eat
them
when
they
went
*NL*
out
for
a
walk
to
Major
Barton
's
,
the
smell
there
was
in
the
little
*NL*
wood
beyond
the
pavilion
where
the
gallnuts
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellows
were
practising
long
shies
and
bowling
lobs
and
slow
*NL*
twisters
.
In
the
soft
grey
silence
he
could
hear
the
bump
of
the
balls
:
*NL*
and
from
here
and
from
there
through
the
quiet
air
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
cricket
bats
:
pick
,
pack
,
pock
,
puck
:
like
drops
of
water
in
a
fountain
*NL*
falling
softly
in
the
brimming
bowl
.

*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Charles
smoked
such
black
twist
that
at
last
his
nephew
suggested
*NL*
to
him
to
enjoy
his
morning
smoke
in
a
little
outhouse
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Very
good
,
Simon
.
All
serene
,
Simon
,
said
the
old
man
tranquilly
.
*NL*
Anywhere
you
like
.
The
outhouse
will
do
me
nicely
:
it
will
be
more
*NL*
salubrious
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Damn
me
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
frankly
,
if
I
know
how
you
can
smoke
such
*NL*
villainous
awful
tobacco
.
It
's
like
gunpowder
,
by
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
very
nice
,
Simon
,
replied
the
old
man
.
Very
cool
and
*NL*
mollifying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
,
therefore
,
uncle
Charles
repaired
to
his
outhouse
but
*NL*
not
before
he
had
greased
and
brushed
scrupulously
his
back
hair
and
*NL*
brushed
and
put
on
his
tall
hat
.
While
he
smoked
the
brim
of
his
tall
*NL*
hat
and
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
were
just
visible
beyond
the
jambs
of
the
*NL*
outhouse
door
.
His
arbour
,
as
he
called
the
reeking
outhouse
which
he
*NL*
shared
with
the
cat
and
the
garden
tools
,
served
him
also
as
a
*NL*
sounding-box
:
and
every
morning
he
hummed
contentedly
one
of
his
*NL*
favourite
songs
:
O
,
TWINE
ME
A
BOWER
or
BLUE
EYES
AND
GOLDEN
HAIR
or
*NL*
THE
GROVES
OF
BLARNEY
while
the
grey
and
blue
coils
of
smoke
rose
*NL*
slowly
from
his
pipe
and
vanished
in
the
pure
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
first
part
of
the
summer
in
Blackrock
uncle
Charles
was
*NL*
Stephen
's
constant
companion
.
Uncle
Charles
was
a
hale
old
man
with
a
*NL*
well
tanned
skin
,
rugged
features
and
white
side
whiskers
.
On
week
days
*NL*
he
did
messages
between
the
house
in
Carysfort
Avenue
and
those
shops
*NL*
in
the
main
street
of
the
town
with
which
the
family
dealt
.
Stephen
was
*NL*
glad
to
go
with
him
on
these
errands
for
uncle
Charles
helped
him
very
*NL*
liberally
to
handfuls
of
whatever
was
exposed
in
open
boxes
and
barrels
*NL*
outside
the
counter
.
He
would
seize
a
handful
of
grapes
and
sawdust
or
*NL*
three
or
four
American
apples
and
thrust
them
generously
into
his
*NL*
grandnephew
's
hand
while
the
shopman
smiled
uneasily
;
and
,
on
Stephen
's
*NL*
feigning
reluctance
to
take
them
,
he
would
frown
and
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Take
them
,
sir
.
Do
you
hear
me
,
sir
?
They
're
good
for
your
bowels
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
order
list
had
been
booked
the
two
would
go
on
to
the
park
*NL*
where
an
old
friend
of
Stephen
's
father
,
Mike
Flynn
,
would
be
found
*NL*
seated
on
a
bench
,
waiting
for
them
.
Then
would
begin
Stephen
's
run
*NL*
round
the
park
.
Mike
Flynn
would
stand
at
the
gate
near
the
railway
*NL*
station
,
watch
in
hand
,
while
Stephen
ran
round
the
track
in
the
style
*NL*
Mike
Flynn
favoured
,
his
head
high
lifted
,
his
knees
well
lifted
and
*NL*
his
hands
held
straight
down
by
his
sides
.
When
the
morning
practice
*NL*
was
over
the
trainer
would
make
his
comments
and
sometimes
illustrate
*NL*
them
by
shuffling
along
for
a
yard
or
so
comically
in
an
old
pair
of
*NL*
blue
canvas
shoes
.
A
small
ring
of
wonderstruck
children
and
nursemaids
*NL*
would
gather
to
watch
him
and
linger
even
when
he
and
uncle
Charles
had
*NL*
sat
down
again
and
were
talking
athletics
and
politics
.
Though
he
had
*NL*
heard
his
father
say
that
Mike
Flynn
had
put
some
of
the
best
runners
*NL*
of
modern
times
through
his
hands
Stephen
often
glanced
at
his
*NL*
trainer
's
flabby
stubble-covered
face
,
as
it
bent
over
the
long
stained
*NL*
fingers
through
which
he
rolled
his
cigarette
,
and
with
pity
at
the
*NL*
mild
lustreless
blue
eyes
which
would
look
up
suddenly
from
the
task
*NL*
and
gaze
vaguely
into
the
blue
distance
while
the
long
swollen
fingers
*NL*
ceased
their
rolling
and
grains
and
fibres
of
tobacco
fell
back
into
*NL*
the
pouch
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
home
uncle
Charles
would
often
pay
a
visit
to
the
chapel
*NL*
and
,
as
the
font
was
above
Stephen
's
reach
,
the
old
man
would
dip
his
*NL*
hand
and
then
sprinkle
the
water
briskly
about
Stephen
's
clothes
and
on
*NL*
the
floor
of
the
porch
.
While
he
prayed
he
knelt
on
his
red
*NL*
handkerchief
and
read
above
his
breath
from
a
thumb
blackened
prayer
*NL*
book
wherein
catchwords
were
printed
at
the
foot
of
every
page
.
Stephen
*NL*
knelt
at
his
side
respecting
,
though
he
did
not
share
,
his
piety
.
He
*NL*
often
wondered
what
his
grand-uncle
prayed
for
so
seriously
.
Perhaps
he
*NL*
prayed
for
the
souls
in
purgatory
or
for
the
grace
of
a
happy
death
or
*NL*
perhaps
he
prayed
that
God
might
send
him
back
a
part
of
the
big
*NL*
fortune
he
had
squandered
in
Cork
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sundays
Stephen
with
his
father
and
his
grand-uncle
took
their
*NL*
constitutional
.
The
old
man
was
a
nimble
walker
in
spite
of
his
corns
*NL*
and
often
ten
or
twelve
miles
of
the
road
were
covered
.
The
little
*NL*
village
of
Stillorgan
was
the
parting
of
the
ways
.
Either
they
went
to
*NL*
the
left
towards
the
Dublin
mountains
or
along
the
Goatstown
road
and
*NL*
thence
into
Dundrum
,
coming
home
by
Sandyford
.
Trudging
along
the
road
*NL*
or
standing
in
some
grimy
wayside
public
house
his
elders
spoke
*NL*
constantly
of
the
subjects
nearer
their
hearts
,
of
Irish
politics
,
of
*NL*
Munster
and
of
the
legends
of
their
own
family
,
to
all
of
which
Stephen
*NL*
lent
an
avid
ear
.
Words
which
he
did
not
understand
he
said
over
and
*NL*
over
to
himself
till
he
had
learnt
them
by
heart
:
and
through
them
he
*NL*
had
glimpses
of
the
real
world
about
them
.
The
hour
when
he
too
would
*NL*
take
part
in
the
life
of
that
world
seemed
drawing
near
and
in
secret
*NL*
he
began
to
make
ready
for
the
great
part
which
he
felt
awaited
him
the
*NL*
nature
of
which
he
only
dimly
apprehended
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
evenings
were
his
own
;
and
he
pored
over
a
ragged
translation
of
*NL*
THE
COUNT
OF
MONTE
CRISTO
.
The
figure
of
that
dark
avenger
stood
forth
*NL*
in
his
mind
for
whatever
he
had
heard
or
divined
in
childhood
of
the
*NL*
strange
and
terrible
.
At
night
he
built
up
on
the
parlour
table
an
*NL*
image
of
the
wonderful
island
cave
out
of
transfers
and
paper
flowers
*NL*
and
coloured
tissue
paper
and
strips
of
the
silver
and
golden
paper
in
*NL*
which
chocolate
is
wrapped
.
When
he
had
broken
up
this
scenery
,
weary
*NL*
of
its
tinsel
,
there
would
come
to
his
mind
the
bright
picture
of
*NL*
Marseille
,
of
sunny
trellises
,
and
of
Mercedes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
Blackrock
,
on
the
road
that
led
to
the
mountains
,
stood
a
small
*NL*
whitewashed
house
in
the
garden
of
which
grew
many
rosebushes
:
and
in
*NL*
this
house
,
he
told
himself
,
another
Mercedes
lived
.
Both
on
the
*NL*
outward
and
on
the
homeward
journey
he
measured
distance
by
this
*NL*
landmark
:
and
in
his
imagination
he
lived
through
a
long
train
of
*NL*
adventures
,
marvellous
as
those
in
the
book
itself
,
towards
the
close
*NL*
of
which
there
appeared
an
image
of
himself
,
grown
older
and
sadder
,
*NL*
standing
in
a
moonlit
garden
with
Mercedes
who
had
so
many
years
before
*NL*
slighted
his
love
,
and
with
a
sadly
proud
gesture
of
refusal
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Madam
,
I
never
eat
muscatel
grapes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
the
ally
of
a
boy
named
Aubrey
Mills
and
founded
with
him
a
*NL*
gang
of
adventurers
in
the
avenue
.
Aubrey
carried
a
whistle
dangling
*NL*
from
his
buttonhole
and
a
bicycle
lamp
attached
to
his
belt
while
the
*NL*
others
had
short
sticks
thrust
daggerwise
through
theirs
.
Stephen
,
who
*NL*
had
read
of
Napoleon
's
plain
style
of
dress
,
chose
to
remain
unadorned
*NL*
and
thereby
heightened
for
himself
the
pleasure
of
taking
counsel
with
*NL*
his
lieutenant
before
giving
orders
.
The
gang
made
forays
into
the
*NL*
gardens
of
old
maids
or
went
down
to
the
castle
and
fought
a
battle
on
*NL*
the
shaggy
weed-grown
rocks
,
coming
home
after
it
weary
stragglers
with
*NL*
the
stale
odours
of
the
foreshore
in
their
nostrils
and
the
rank
oils
*NL*
of
the
seawrack
upon
their
hands
and
in
their
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aubrey
and
Stephen
had
a
common
milkman
and
often
they
drove
out
in
the
*NL*
milk-car
to
Carrickmines
where
the
cows
were
at
grass
.
While
the
men
*NL*
were
milking
the
boys
would
take
turns
in
riding
the
tractable
mare
*NL*
round
the
field
.
But
when
autumn
came
the
cows
were
driven
home
from
*NL*
the
grass
:
and
the
first
sight
of
the
filthy
cowyard
at
Stradbrook
with
*NL*
its
foul
green
puddles
and
clots
of
liquid
dung
and
steaming
bran
*NL*
troughs
,
sickened
Stephen
's
heart
.
The
cattle
which
had
seemed
so
*NL*
beautiful
in
the
country
on
sunny
days
revolted
him
and
he
could
not
*NL*
even
look
at
the
milk
they
yielded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coming
of
September
did
not
trouble
him
this
year
for
he
was
not
to
*NL*
be
sent
back
to
Clongowes
.
The
practice
in
the
park
came
to
an
end
when
*NL*
Mike
Flynn
went
into
hospital
.
Aubrey
was
at
school
and
had
only
an
*NL*
hour
or
two
free
in
the
evening
.
The
gang
fell
asunder
and
there
were
*NL*
no
more
nightly
forays
or
battles
on
the
rocks
.
Stephen
sometimes
went
*NL*
round
with
the
car
which
delivered
the
evening
milk
and
these
chilly
*NL*
drives
blew
away
his
memory
of
the
filth
of
the
cowyard
and
he
felt
no
*NL*
repugnance
at
seeing
the
cow
hairs
and
hayseeds
on
the
milkman
's
coat
.
*NL*
Whenever
the
car
drew
up
before
a
house
he
waited
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
*NL*
a
well
scrubbed
kitchen
or
of
a
softly
lighted
hall
and
to
see
how
the
*NL*
servant
would
hold
the
jug
and
how
she
would
close
the
door
.
He
thought
*NL*
it
should
be
a
pleasant
life
enough
,
driving
along
the
roads
every
*NL*
evening
to
deliver
milk
,
if
he
had
warm
gloves
and
a
fat
bag
of
*NL*
gingernuts
in
his
pocket
to
eat
from
.
But
the
same
foreknowledge
which
*NL*
had
sickened
his
heart
and
made
his
legs
sag
suddenly
as
he
raced
round
*NL*
the
park
,
the
same
intuition
which
had
made
him
glance
with
mistrust
at
*NL*
his
trainer
's
flabby
stubble-covered
face
as
it
bent
heavily
over
his
long
*NL*
stained
fingers
,
dissipated
any
vision
of
the
future
.
In
a
vague
way
he
*NL*
understood
that
his
father
was
in
trouble
and
that
this
was
the
reason
*NL*
why
he
himself
had
not
been
sent
back
to
Clongowes
.
For
some
time
he
*NL*
had
felt
the
slight
change
in
his
house
;
and
those
changes
in
what
he
*NL*
had
deemed
unchangeable
were
so
many
slight
shocks
to
his
boyish
*NL*
conception
of
the
world
.
The
ambition
which
he
felt
astir
at
times
in
*NL*
the
darkness
of
his
soul
sought
no
outlet
.
A
dusk
like
that
of
the
*NL*
outer
world
obscured
his
mind
as
he
heard
the
mare
's
hoofs
clattering
*NL*
along
the
tramtrack
on
the
Rock
Road
and
the
great
can
swaying
and
*NL*
rattling
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
Mercedes
and
,
as
he
brooded
upon
her
image
,
a
strange
*NL*
unrest
crept
into
his
blood
.
Sometimes
a
fever
gathered
within
him
and
*NL*
led
him
to
rove
alone
in
the
evening
along
the
quiet
avenue
.
The
peace
*NL*
of
the
gardens
and
the
kindly
lights
in
the
windows
poured
a
tender
*NL*
influence
into
his
restless
heart
.
The
noise
of
children
at
play
*NL*
annoyed
him
and
their
silly
voices
made
him
feel
,
even
more
keenly
than
*NL*
he
had
felt
at
Clongowes
,
that
he
was
different
from
others
.
He
did
not
*NL*
want
to
play
.
He
wanted
to
meet
in
the
real
world
the
unsubstantial
*NL*
image
which
his
soul
so
constantly
beheld
.
He
did
not
know
where
to
*NL*
seek
it
or
how
,
but
a
premonition
which
led
him
on
told
him
that
this
*NL*
image
would
,
without
any
overt
act
of
his
,
encounter
him
.
They
would
*NL*
meet
quietly
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
and
had
made
their
tryst
,
*NL*
perhaps
at
one
of
the
gates
or
in
some
more
secret
place
.
They
would
be
*NL*
alone
,
surrounded
by
darkness
and
silence
:
and
in
that
moment
of
*NL*
supreme
tenderness
he
would
be
transfigured
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
fade
into
something
impalpable
under
her
eyes
and
then
in
a
*NL*
moment
he
would
be
transfigured
.
Weakness
and
timidity
and
inexperience
*NL*
would
fall
from
him
in
that
magic
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Two
great
yellow
caravans
had
halted
one
morning
before
the
door
and
*NL*
men
had
come
tramping
into
the
house
to
dismantle
it
.
The
furniture
had
*NL*
been
hustled
out
through
the
front
garden
which
was
strewn
with
wisps
*NL*
of
straw
and
rope
ends
and
into
the
huge
vans
at
the
gate
.
When
all
had
*NL*
been
safely
stowed
the
vans
had
set
off
noisily
down
the
avenue
:
and
*NL*
from
the
window
of
the
railway
carriage
,
in
which
he
had
sat
with
his
*NL*
red-eyed
mother
,
Stephen
had
seen
them
lumbering
along
the
Merrion
*NL*
Road
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
parlour
fire
would
not
draw
that
evening
and
Mr
Dedalus
rested
the
*NL*
poker
against
the
bars
of
the
grate
to
attract
the
flame
.
Uncle
Charles
*NL*
dozed
in
a
corner
of
the
half
furnished
uncarpeted
room
and
near
him
*NL*
the
family
portraits
leaned
against
the
wall
.
The
lamp
on
the
table
*NL*
shed
a
weak
light
over
the
boarded
floor
,
muddied
by
the
feet
of
the
*NL*
van-men
.
Stephen
sat
on
a
footstool
beside
his
father
listening
to
a
*NL*
long
and
incoherent
monologue
.
He
understood
little
or
nothing
of
it
at
*NL*
first
but
he
became
slowly
aware
that
his
father
had
enemies
and
that
*NL*
some
fight
was
going
to
take
place
.
He
felt
,
too
,
that
he
was
being
*NL*
enlisted
for
the
fight
,
that
some
duty
was
being
laid
upon
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
The
sudden
flight
from
the
comfort
and
revery
of
Blackrock
,
*NL*
the
passage
through
the
gloomy
foggy
city
,
the
thought
of
the
bare
*NL*
cheerless
house
in
which
they
were
now
to
live
made
his
heart
heavy
,
*NL*
and
again
an
intuition
,
a
foreknowledge
of
the
future
came
to
him
.
He
*NL*
understood
also
why
the
servants
had
often
whispered
together
in
the
*NL*
hall
and
why
his
father
had
often
stood
on
the
hearthrug
with
his
back
*NL*
to
the
fire
,
talking
loudly
to
uncle
Charles
who
urged
him
to
sit
down
*NL*
and
eat
his
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
's
a
crack
of
the
whip
left
in
me
yet
,
Stephen
,
old
chap
,
said
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
,
poking
at
the
dull
fire
with
fierce
energy
.
We
're
not
dead
*NL*
yet
,
sonny
.
No
,
by
the
Lord
Jesus
-LRB-
God
forgive
me
-RRB-
not
half
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dublin
was
a
new
and
complex
sensation
.
Uncle
Charles
had
grown
so
*NL*
witless
that
he
could
no
longer
be
sent
out
on
errands
and
the
disorder
*NL*
in
settling
in
the
new
house
left
Stephen
freer
than
he
had
been
in
*NL*
Blackrock
.
In
the
beginning
he
contented
himself
with
circling
timidly
*NL*
round
the
neighbouring
square
or
,
at
most
,
going
half
way
down
one
of
*NL*
the
side
streets
but
when
he
had
made
a
skeleton
map
of
the
city
in
his
*NL*
mind
he
followed
boldly
one
of
its
central
lines
until
he
reached
the
*NL*
customhouse
.
He
passed
unchallenged
among
the
docks
and
along
the
quays
*NL*
wondering
at
the
multitude
of
corks
that
lay
bobbing
on
the
surface
of
*NL*
the
water
in
a
thick
yellow
scum
,
at
the
crowds
of
quay
porters
and
the
*NL*
rumbling
carts
and
the
ill-dressed
bearded
policeman
.
The
vastness
and
*NL*
strangeness
of
the
life
suggested
to
him
by
the
bales
of
merchandise
*NL*
stocked
along
the
walls
or
swung
aloft
out
of
the
holds
of
steamers
*NL*
wakened
again
in
him
the
unrest
which
had
sent
him
wandering
in
the
*NL*
evening
from
garden
to
garden
in
search
of
Mercedes
.
And
amid
this
new
*NL*
bustling
life
he
might
have
fancied
himself
in
another
Marseille
but
that
*NL*
he
missed
the
bright
sky
and
the
sun-warmed
trellises
of
the
wineshops
.
*NL*
A
vague
dissatisfaction
grew
up
within
him
as
he
looked
on
the
quays
and
*NL*
on
the
river
and
on
the
lowering
skies
and
yet
he
continued
to
wander
up
*NL*
and
down
day
after
day
as
if
he
really
sought
someone
that
eluded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
once
or
twice
with
his
mother
to
visit
their
relatives
:
and
*NL*
though
they
passed
a
jovial
array
of
shops
lit
up
and
adorned
for
*NL*
Christmas
his
mood
of
embittered
silence
did
not
leave
him
.
The
causes
*NL*
of
his
embitterment
were
many
,
remote
and
near
.
He
was
angry
with
*NL*
himself
for
being
young
and
the
prey
of
restless
foolish
impulses
,
*NL*
angry
also
with
the
change
of
fortune
which
was
reshaping
the
world
*NL*
about
him
into
a
vision
of
squalor
and
insincerity
.
Yet
his
anger
lent
*NL*
nothing
to
the
vision
.
He
chronicled
with
patience
what
he
saw
,
*NL*
detaching
himself
from
it
and
tasting
its
mortifying
flavour
in
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sitting
on
the
backless
chair
in
his
aunt
's
kitchen
.
A
lamp
with
*NL*
a
reflector
hung
on
the
japanned
wall
of
the
fireplace
and
by
its
light
*NL*
his
aunt
was
reading
the
evening
paper
that
lay
on
her
knees
.
She
*NL*
looked
a
long
time
at
a
smiling
picture
that
was
set
in
it
and
said
*NL*
musingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
beautiful
Mabel
Hunter
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
ringletted
girl
stood
on
tiptoe
to
peer
at
the
picture
and
said
softly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
she
in
,
mud
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
a
pantomime
,
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
leaned
her
ringletted
head
against
her
mother
's
sleeve
,
*NL*
gazing
on
the
picture
,
and
murmured
as
if
fascinated
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
beautiful
Mabel
Hunter
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
fascinated
,
her
eyes
rested
long
upon
those
demurely
taunting
*NL*
eyes
and
she
murmured
devotedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
n't
she
an
exquisite
creature
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
boy
who
came
in
from
the
street
,
stamping
crookedly
under
his
*NL*
stone
of
coal
,
heard
her
words
.
He
dropped
his
load
promptly
on
the
*NL*
floor
and
hurried
to
her
side
to
see
.
He
mauled
the
edges
of
the
paper
*NL*
with
his
reddened
and
blackened
hands
,
shouldering
her
aside
and
*NL*
complaining
that
he
could
not
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sitting
in
the
narrow
breakfast
room
high
up
in
the
old
*NL*
dark-windowed
house
.
The
firelight
flickered
on
the
wall
and
beyond
the
*NL*
window
a
spectral
dusk
was
gathering
upon
the
river
.
Before
the
fire
an
*NL*
old
woman
was
busy
making
tea
and
,
as
she
bustled
at
the
task
,
she
told
*NL*
in
a
low
voice
of
what
the
priest
and
the
doctor
had
said
.
She
told
too
*NL*
of
certain
changes
they
had
seen
in
her
of
late
and
of
her
odd
ways
and
*NL*
sayings
.
He
sat
listening
to
the
words
and
following
the
ways
of
*NL*
adventure
that
lay
open
in
the
coals
,
arches
and
vaults
and
winding
*NL*
galleries
and
jagged
caverns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
became
aware
of
something
in
the
doorway
.
A
skull
appeared
*NL*
suspended
in
the
gloom
of
the
doorway
.
A
feeble
creature
like
a
monkey
*NL*
was
there
,
drawn
thither
by
the
sound
of
voices
at
the
fire
.
A
whining
*NL*
voice
came
from
the
door
asking
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
that
Josephine
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
bustling
woman
answered
cheerily
from
the
fireplace
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
Ellen
,
it
's
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O.
.
.
O
,
good
evening
,
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
the
greeting
and
saw
a
silly
smile
break
over
the
face
in
*NL*
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
want
anything
,
Ellen
?
asked
the
old
woman
at
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
did
not
answer
the
question
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
thought
it
was
Josephine
.
I
thought
you
were
Josephine
,
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
repeating
this
several
times
,
she
fell
to
laughing
feebly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sitting
in
the
midst
of
a
children
's
party
at
Harold
's
Cross
.
*NL*
His
silent
watchful
manner
had
grown
upon
him
and
he
took
little
part
*NL*
in
the
games
.
The
children
,
wearing
the
spoils
of
their
crackers
,
*NL*
danced
and
romped
noisily
and
,
though
he
tried
to
share
their
*NL*
merriment
,
he
felt
himself
a
gloomy
figure
amid
the
gay
cocked
hats
and
*NL*
sunbonnets
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
he
had
sung
his
song
and
withdrawn
into
a
snug
corner
of
the
*NL*
room
he
began
to
taste
the
joy
of
his
loneliness
.
The
mirth
,
which
in
*NL*
the
beginning
of
the
evening
had
seemed
to
him
false
and
trivial
,
was
*NL*
like
a
soothing
air
to
him
,
passing
gaily
by
his
senses
,
hiding
from
*NL*
other
eyes
the
feverish
agitation
of
his
blood
while
through
the
*NL*
circling
of
the
dancers
and
amid
the
music
and
laughter
her
glance
*NL*
travelled
to
his
corner
,
flattering
,
taunting
,
searching
,
exciting
his
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hall
the
children
who
had
stayed
latest
were
putting
on
their
*NL*
things
:
the
party
was
over
.
She
had
thrown
a
shawl
about
her
and
,
as
*NL*
they
went
together
towards
the
tram
,
sprays
of
her
fresh
warm
breath
*NL*
flew
gaily
above
her
cowled
head
and
her
shoes
tapped
blithely
on
the
*NL*
glassy
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
last
tram
.
The
lank
brown
horses
knew
it
and
shook
their
*NL*
bells
to
the
clear
night
in
admonition
.
The
conductor
talked
with
the
*NL*
driver
,
both
nodding
often
in
the
green
light
of
the
lamp
.
On
the
empty
*NL*
seats
of
the
tram
were
scattered
a
few
coloured
tickets
.
No
sound
of
*NL*
footsteps
came
up
or
down
the
road
.
No
sound
broke
the
peace
of
the
*NL*
night
save
when
the
lank
brown
horses
rubbed
their
noses
together
and
*NL*
shook
their
bells
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
seemed
to
listen
,
he
on
the
upper
step
and
she
on
the
lower
.
She
*NL*
came
up
to
his
step
many
times
and
went
down
to
hers
again
between
*NL*
their
phrases
and
once
or
twice
stood
close
beside
him
for
some
moments
*NL*
on
the
upper
step
,
forgetting
to
go
down
,
and
then
went
down
.
His
heart
*NL*
danced
upon
her
movements
like
a
cork
upon
a
tide
.
He
heard
what
her
*NL*
eyes
said
to
him
from
beneath
their
cowl
and
knew
that
in
some
dim
*NL*
past
,
whether
in
life
or
revery
,
he
had
heard
their
tale
before
.
He
saw
*NL*
her
urge
her
vanities
,
her
fine
dress
and
sash
and
long
black
*NL*
stockings
,
and
knew
that
he
had
yielded
to
them
a
thousand
times
.
Yet
a
*NL*
voice
within
him
spoke
above
the
noise
of
his
dancing
heart
,
asking
him
*NL*
would
he
take
her
gift
to
which
he
had
only
to
stretch
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
And
he
remembered
the
day
when
he
and
Eileen
had
stood
looking
into
the
*NL*
hotel
grounds
,
watching
the
waiters
running
up
a
trail
of
bunting
on
*NL*
the
flagstaff
and
the
fox
terrier
scampering
to
and
fro
on
the
sunny
*NL*
lawn
and
how
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
she
had
broken
out
into
a
peal
of
*NL*
laughter
and
had
run
down
the
sloping
curve
of
the
path
.
Now
,
as
then
,
*NL*
he
stood
listlessly
in
his
place
,
seemingly
a
tranquil
watcher
of
the
*NL*
scene
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
She
too
wants
me
to
catch
hold
of
her
,
he
thought
.
That
's
why
she
*NL*
came
with
me
to
the
tram
.
I
could
easily
catch
hold
of
her
when
she
*NL*
comes
up
to
my
step
:
nobody
is
looking
.
I
could
hold
her
and
kiss
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
neither
:
and
,
when
he
was
sitting
alone
in
the
deserted
*NL*
tram
,
he
tore
his
ticket
into
shreds
and
stared
gloomily
at
the
*NL*
corrugated
footboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
he
sat
at
his
table
in
the
bare
upper
room
for
many
hours
.
*NL*
Before
him
lay
a
new
pen
,
a
new
bottle
of
ink
and
a
new
emerald
*NL*
exercise
.
From
force
of
habit
he
had
written
at
the
top
of
the
*NL*
first
page
the
initial
letters
of
the
jesuit
motto
:
A.M.D.G.
On
the
*NL*
first
line
of
the
page
appeared
the
title
of
the
verses
he
was
trying
*NL*
to
write
:
To
E
--
C
--
.
He
knew
it
was
right
to
begin
so
for
he
had
seen
*NL*
similar
titles
in
the
collected
poems
of
Lord
Byron
.
When
he
had
*NL*
written
this
title
and
drawn
an
ornamental
line
underneath
he
fell
into
*NL*
a
daydream
and
began
to
draw
diagrams
on
the
cover
of
the
book
.
He
saw
*NL*
himself
sitting
at
his
table
in
Bray
the
morning
after
the
discussion
*NL*
at
the
Christmas
dinner
table
,
trying
to
write
a
poem
about
Parnell
on
*NL*
the
back
of
one
of
his
father
's
second
moiety
notices
.
But
his
brain
*NL*
had
then
refused
to
grapple
with
the
theme
and
,
desisting
,
he
had
*NL*
covered
the
page
with
the
names
and
addresses
of
certain
of
his
*NL*
classmates
:
*NL*
*NL*
Roderick
Kickham
*NL*
John
Lawton
*NL*
Anthony
MacSwiney
*NL*
Simon
Moonan
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
fail
again
but
,
by
dint
of
brooding
on
the
*NL*
incident
,
he
thought
himself
into
confidence
.
During
this
process
all
*NL*
those
elements
which
he
deemed
common
and
insignificant
fell
out
of
the
*NL*
scene
.
There
remained
no
trace
of
the
tram
itself
nor
of
the
tram-men
*NL*
nor
of
the
horses
:
nor
did
he
and
she
appear
vividly
.
The
verses
told
*NL*
only
of
the
night
and
the
balmy
breeze
and
the
maiden
lustre
of
the
*NL*
moon
.
Some
undefined
sorrow
was
hidden
in
the
hearts
of
the
*NL*
protagonists
as
they
stood
in
silence
beneath
the
leafless
trees
and
*NL*
when
the
moment
of
farewell
had
come
the
kiss
,
which
had
been
withheld
*NL*
by
one
,
was
given
by
both
.
After
this
the
letters
L.
D.
S.
were
written
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
page
,
and
,
having
hidden
the
book
,
he
went
into
his
*NL*
mother
's
bedroom
and
gazed
at
his
face
for
a
long
time
in
the
mirror
of
*NL*
her
dressing-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
long
spell
of
leisure
and
liberty
was
drawing
to
its
end
.
One
*NL*
evening
his
father
came
home
full
of
news
which
kept
his
tongue
busy
*NL*
all
through
dinner
.
Stephen
had
been
awaiting
his
father
's
return
for
*NL*
there
had
been
mutton
hash
that
day
and
he
knew
that
his
father
would
*NL*
make
him
dip
his
bread
in
the
gravy
.
But
he
did
not
relish
the
hash
for
*NL*
the
mention
of
Clongowes
had
coated
his
palate
with
a
scum
of
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
walked
bang
into
him
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
for
the
fourth
time
,
just
at
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
I
suppose
,
said
Mrs
Dedalus
,
he
will
be
able
to
arrange
it
.
I
*NL*
mean
about
Belvedere
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
course
he
will
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
Do
n't
I
tell
you
he
's
provincial
*NL*
of
the
order
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
never
liked
the
idea
of
sending
him
to
the
christian
brothers
*NL*
myself
,
said
Mrs
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Christian
brothers
be
damned
!
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
Is
it
with
Paddy
*NL*
Stink
and
Micky
Mud
?
No
,
let
him
stick
to
the
jesuits
in
God
's
name
*NL*
since
he
began
with
them
.
They
'll
be
of
service
to
him
in
after
years
.
*NL*
Those
are
the
fellows
that
can
get
you
a
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
they
're
a
very
rich
order
,
are
n't
they
,
Simon
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Rather
.
They
live
well
,
I
tell
you
.
You
saw
their
table
at
*NL*
Clongowes
.
Fed
up
,
by
God
,
like
gamecocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
pushed
his
plate
over
to
Stephen
and
bade
him
finish
what
*NL*
was
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
then
,
Stephen
,
he
said
,
you
must
put
your
shoulder
to
the
wheel
,
*NL*
old
chap
.
You
've
had
a
fine
long
holiday
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
I
'm
sure
he
'll
work
very
hard
now
,
said
Mrs
Dedalus
,
especially
*NL*
when
he
has
Maurice
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
Holy
Paul
,
I
forgot
about
Maurice
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
Here
,
*NL*
Maurice
!
Come
here
,
you
thick-headed
ruffian
!
Do
you
know
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
send
you
to
a
college
where
they
'll
teach
you
to
spell
c.a.t.
cat
.
And
*NL*
I
'll
buy
you
a
nice
little
penny
handkerchief
to
keep
your
nose
dry
.
*NL*
Wo
n't
that
be
grand
fun
?
*NL*
*NL*
Maurice
grinned
at
his
father
and
then
at
his
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
screwed
his
glass
into
his
eye
and
stared
hard
at
both
his
*NL*
sons
.
Stephen
mumbled
his
bread
without
answering
his
father
's
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
By
the
bye
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
at
length
,
the
rector
,
or
provincial
*NL*
rather
,
was
telling
me
that
story
about
you
and
Father
Dolan
.
You
're
an
*NL*
impudent
thief
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
he
did
n't
,
Simon
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
he
!
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
But
he
gave
me
a
great
account
of
the
whole
*NL*
affair
.
We
were
chatting
,
you
know
,
and
one
word
borrowed
another
.
And
,
*NL*
by
the
way
,
who
do
you
think
he
told
me
will
get
that
job
in
the
*NL*
corporation
?
But
I
'll
tell
you
that
after
.
Well
,
as
I
was
saying
,
we
*NL*
were
chatting
away
quite
friendly
and
he
asked
me
did
our
friend
here
*NL*
wear
glasses
still
,
and
then
he
told
me
the
whole
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
was
he
annoyed
,
Simon
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Annoyed
?
Not
he
!
MANLY
LITTLE
CHAP
!
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
imitated
the
mincing
nasal
tone
of
the
provincial
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Dolan
and
I
,
when
I
told
them
all
at
dinner
about
it
,
Father
*NL*
Dolan
and
I
had
a
great
laugh
over
it
.
YOU
BETTER
MIND
YOURSELF
FATHER
*NL*
DOLAN
,
said
I
,
OR
YOUNG
DEDALUS
WILL
SEND
YOU
UP
FOR
TWICE
NINE
.
We
had
*NL*
a
famous
laugh
together
over
it
.
Ha
!
Ha
!
Ha
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
turned
to
his
wife
and
interjected
in
his
natural
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Shows
you
the
spirit
in
which
they
take
the
boys
there
.
O
,
a
jesuit
*NL*
for
your
life
,
for
diplomacy
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
reassumed
the
provincial
's
voice
and
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
TOLD
THEM
ALL
AT
DINNER
ABOUT
IT
AND
FATHER
DOLAN
AND
I
AND
ALL
OF
*NL*
US
WE
HAD
A
HEARTY
LAUGH
TOGETHER
OVER
IT
.
HA

HA

The
night
of
the
Whitsuntide
play
had
come
and
Stephen
from
the
window
*NL*
of
the
dressing-room
looked
out
on
the
small
grass-plot
across
which
*NL*
lines
of
Chinese
lanterns
were
stretched
.
He
watched
the
visitors
come
*NL*
down
the
steps
from
the
house
and
pass
into
the
theatre
.
Stewards
in
*NL*
evening
dress
,
old
Belvedereans
,
loitered
in
groups
about
the
entrance
*NL*
to
the
theatre
and
ushered
in
the
visitors
with
ceremony
.
Under
the
*NL*
sudden
glow
of
a
lantern
he
could
recognize
the
smiling
face
of
a
*NL*
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Blessed
Sacrament
had
been
removed
from
the
tabernacle
and
the
*NL*
first
benches
had
been
driven
back
so
as
to
leave
the
dais
of
the
altar
*NL*
and
the
space
before
it
free
.
Against
the
walls
stood
companies
of
*NL*
barbells
and
Indian
clubs
;
the
dumbbells
were
piled
in
one
corner
:
and
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
countless
hillocks
of
gymnasium
shoes
and
sweaters
and
*NL*
singlets
in
untidy
brown
parcels
there
stood
the
stout
leather-jacketed
*NL*
vaulting
horse
waiting
its
turn
to
be
carried
up
on
the
stage
*NL*
and
set
in
the
middle
of
the
winning
team
at
the
end
of
the
gymnastic
*NL*
display
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
though
in
deference
to
his
reputation
for
essay
writing
he
had
*NL*
been
elected
secretary
to
the
gymnasium
,
had
had
no
part
in
the
first
*NL*
section
of
the
programme
but
in
the
play
which
formed
the
second
*NL*
section
he
had
the
chief
part
,
that
of
a
farcical
pedagogue
.
He
had
*NL*
been
cast
for
it
on
account
of
his
stature
and
grave
manners
for
he
was
*NL*
now
at
the
end
of
his
second
year
at
Belvedere
and
in
number
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
score
of
the
younger
boys
in
white
knickers
and
singlets
came
*NL*
pattering
down
from
the
stage
,
through
the
vestry
and
to
the
chapel
.
*NL*
The
vestry
and
chapel
were
peopled
with
eager
masters
and
boys
.
The
*NL*
plump
bald
sergeant
major
was
testing
with
his
foot
the
springboard
of
*NL*
the
vaulting
horse
.
The
lean
young
man
in
a
long
overcoat
,
who
was
to
*NL*
give
a
special
display
of
intricate
club
swinging
,
stood
near
watching
*NL*
with
interest
,
his
silver-coated
clubs
peeping
out
of
his
deep
*NL*
side-pockets
.
The
hollow
rattle
of
the
wooden
dumbbells
was
heard
as
*NL*
another
team
made
ready
to
go
up
on
the
stage
:
and
in
another
moment
the
*NL*
excited
prefect
was
hustling
the
boys
through
the
vestry
like
a
flock
of
*NL*
geese
,
flapping
the
wings
of
his
soutane
nervously
and
crying
to
the
*NL*
laggards
to
make
haste
.
A
little
troop
of
Neapolitan
peasants
were
*NL*
practising
their
steps
at
the
end
of
the
chapel
,
some
circling
their
arms
*NL*
above
their
heads
,
some
swaying
their
baskets
of
paper
violets
and
*NL*
curtsying
.
In
a
dark
corner
of
the
chapel
at
the
gospel
side
of
the
altar
*NL*
a
stout
old
lady
knelt
amid
her
copious
black
skirts
.
When
she
stood
up
a
*NL*
pink-dressed
figure
,
wearing
a
curly
golden
wig
and
an
old-fashioned
straw
*NL*
sunbonnet
,
with
black
pencilled
eyebrows
and
cheeks
delicately
rouged
and
*NL*
powdered
,
was
discovered
.
A
low
murmur
of
curiosity
ran
round
the
chapel
*NL*
at
the
discovery
of
this
girlish
figure
.
One
of
the
prefects
,
smiling
and
*NL*
nodding
his
head
,
approached
the
dark
corner
and
,
having
bowed
to
the
*NL*
stout
old
lady
,
said
pleasantly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
this
a
beautiful
young
lady
or
a
doll
that
you
have
here
,
Mrs
*NL*
Tallon
?
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
bending
down
to
peer
at
the
smiling
painted
face
under
the
leaf
*NL*
of
the
bonnet
,
he
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
!
Upon
my
word
I
believe
it
's
little
Bertie
Tallon
after
all
!
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
at
his
post
by
the
window
heard
the
old
lady
and
the
priest
*NL*
laugh
together
and
heard
the
boys
'
murmurs
of
admiration
behind
him
as
*NL*
they
passed
forward
to
see
the
little
boy
who
had
to
dance
the
*NL*
sunbonnet
dance
by
himself
.
A
movement
of
impatience
escaped
him
.
He
*NL*
let
the
edge
of
the
blind
fall
and
,
stepping
down
from
the
bench
on
*NL*
which
he
had
been
standing
,
walked
out
of
the
chapel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
out
of
the
schoolhouse
and
halted
under
the
shed
that
flanked
*NL*
the
garden
.
From
the
theatre
opposite
came
the
muffled
noise
of
the
*NL*
audience
and
sudden
brazen
clashes
of
the
soldiers
'
band
.
The
light
*NL*
spread
upwards
from
the
glass
roof
making
the
theatre
seem
a
festive
*NL*
ark
,
anchored
among
the
hulks
of
houses
,
her
frail
cables
of
lanterns
*NL*
looping
her
to
her
moorings
.
A
side
door
of
the
theatre
opened
suddenly
*NL*
and
a
shaft
of
light
flew
across
the
grass
plots
.
A
sudden
burst
of
*NL*
music
issued
from
the
ark
,
the
prelude
of
a
waltz
:
and
when
the
side
*NL*
door
closed
again
the
listener
could
hear
the
faint
rhythm
of
the
*NL*
music
.
The
sentiment
of
the
opening
bars
,
their
languor
and
supple
*NL*
movement
,
evoked
the
incommunicable
emotion
which
had
been
the
cause
of
*NL*
all
his
day
's
unrest
and
of
his
impatient
movement
of
a
moment
before
.
*NL*
His
unrest
issued
from
him
like
a
wave
of
sound
:
and
on
the
tide
of
*NL*
flowing
music
the
ark
was
journeying
,
trailing
her
cables
of
lanterns
*NL*
in
her
wake
.
Then
a
noise
like
dwarf
artillery
broke
the
movement
.
It
*NL*
was
the
clapping
that
greeted
the
entry
of
the
dumbbell
team
on
the
*NL*
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
far
end
of
the
shed
near
the
street
a
speck
of
pink
light
showed
*NL*
in
the
darkness
and
as
he
walked
towards
it
he
became
aware
of
a
faint
*NL*
aromatic
odour
.
Two
boys
were
standing
in
the
shelter
of
a
doorway
,
*NL*
smoking
,
and
before
he
reached
them
he
had
recognised
Heron
by
his
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
comes
the
noble
Dedalus
!
cried
a
high
throaty
voice
.
Welcome
to
*NL*
our
trusty
friend
!
*NL*
*NL*
This
welcome
ended
in
a
soft
peal
of
mirthless
laughter
as
Heron
*NL*
salaamed
and
then
began
to
poke
the
ground
with
his
cane
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
I
am
,
said
Stephen
,
halting
and
glancing
from
Heron
to
his
*NL*
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
was
a
stranger
to
him
but
in
the
darkness
,
by
the
aid
of
the
*NL*
glowing
cigarette
tips
,
he
could
make
out
a
pale
dandyish
face
over
*NL*
which
a
smile
was
travelling
slowly
,
a
tall
overcoated
figure
and
a
*NL*
hard
hat
.
Heron
did
not
trouble
himself
about
an
introduction
but
said
*NL*
instead
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
was
just
telling
my
friend
Wallis
what
a
lark
it
would
be
tonight
*NL*
if
you
took
off
the
rector
in
the
part
of
the
schoolmaster
.
It
would
be
*NL*
a
ripping
good
joke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heron
made
a
poor
attempt
to
imitate
for
his
friend
Wallis
the
rector
's
*NL*
pedantic
bass
and
then
,
laughing
at
his
failure
,
asked
Stephen
to
do
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Go
on
,
Dedalus
,
he
urged
,
you
can
take
him
off
rippingly
.
HE
THAT
WILL
*NL*
NOT
HEAR
THE
CHURCHA
LET
HIM
BE
TO
THEEA
AS
THE
HEATHENA
AND
THE
*NL*
PUBLICANA
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
imitation
was
prevented
by
a
mild
expression
of
anger
from
Wallis
*NL*
in
whose
mouthpiece
the
cigarette
had
become
too
tightly
wedged
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Damn
this
blankety
blank
holder
,
he
said
,
taking
it
from
his
mouth
*NL*
and
smiling
and
frowning
upon
it
tolerantly
.
It
's
always
getting
stuck
*NL*
like
that
.
Do
you
use
a
holder
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
n't
smoke
,
answered
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
said
Heron
,
Dedalus
is
a
model
youth
.
He
does
n't
smoke
and
he
*NL*
does
n't
go
to
bazaars
and
he
does
n't
flirt
and
he
does
n't
damn
anything
*NL*
or
damn
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
shook
his
head
and
smiled
in
his
rival
's
flushed
and
mobile
*NL*
face
,
beaked
like
a
bird
's
.
He
had
often
thought
it
strange
that
*NL*
Vincent
Heron
had
a
bird
's
face
as
well
as
a
bird
's
name
.
A
shock
of
*NL*
pale
hair
lay
on
the
forehead
like
a
ruffled
crest
:
the
forehead
was
*NL*
narrow
and
bony
and
a
thin
hooked
nose
stood
out
between
the
close-set
*NL*
prominent
eyes
which
were
light
and
inexpressive
.
The
rivals
were
*NL*
school
friends
.
They
sat
together
in
class
,
knelt
together
in
the
*NL*
chapel
,
talked
together
after
beads
over
their
lunches
.
As
the
fellows
*NL*
in
number
one
were
undistinguished
dullards
,
Stephen
and
Heron
had
been
*NL*
during
the
year
the
virtual
heads
of
the
school
.
It
was
they
who
went
*NL*
up
to
the
rector
together
to
ask
for
a
free
day
or
to
get
a
fellow
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
by
the
way
,
said
Heron
suddenly
,
I
saw
your
governor
going
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smile
waned
on
Stephen
's
face
.
Any
allusion
made
to
his
father
by
a
*NL*
fellow
or
by
a
master
put
his
calm
to
rout
in
a
moment
.
He
waited
in
*NL*
timorous
silence
to
hear
what
Heron
might
say
next
.
Heron
,
however
,
*NL*
nudged
him
expressively
with
his
elbow
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
're
a
sly
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
so
?
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
'd
think
butter
would
n't
melt
in
your
mouth
said
Heron
.
But
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
you
're
a
sly
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Might
I
ask
you
what
you
are
talking
about
?
said
Stephen
urbanely
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Indeed
you
might
,
answered
Heron
.
We
saw
her
,
Wallis
,
did
n't
we
?
And
*NL*
deucedly
pretty
she
is
too
.
And
inquisitive
!
AND
WHAT
PART
DOES
STEPHEN
*NL*
TAKE
,
MR
DEDALUS
?
AND
WILL
STEPHEN
NOT
SING
,
MR
DEDALUS
?
Your
governor
*NL*
was
staring
at
her
through
that
eyeglass
of
his
for
all
he
was
worth
so
*NL*
that
I
think
the
old
man
has
found
you
out
too
.
I
would
n't
care
a
bit
,
*NL*
by
Jove
.
She
's
ripping
,
is
n't
she
,
Wallis
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
half
bad
,
answered
Wallis
quietly
as
he
placed
his
holder
once
*NL*
more
in
a
corner
of
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
shaft
of
momentary
anger
flew
through
Stephen
's
mind
at
these
*NL*
indelicate
allusions
in
the
hearing
of
a
stranger
.
For
him
there
was
*NL*
nothing
amusing
in
a
girl
's
interest
and
regard
.
All
day
he
had
thought
*NL*
of
nothing
but
their
leave-taking
on
the
steps
of
the
tram
at
Harold
's
*NL*
Cross
,
the
stream
of
moody
emotions
it
had
made
to
course
through
him
*NL*
and
the
poem
he
had
written
about
it
.
All
day
he
had
imagined
a
new
*NL*
meeting
with
her
for
he
knew
that
she
was
to
come
to
the
play
.
The
old
*NL*
restless
moodiness
had
again
filled
his
breast
as
it
had
done
on
the
*NL*
night
of
the
party
,
but
had
not
found
an
outlet
in
verse
.
The
growth
*NL*
and
knowledge
of
two
years
of
boyhood
stood
between
then
and
now
,
*NL*
forbidding
such
an
outlet
:
and
all
day
the
stream
of
gloomy
tenderness
*NL*
within
him
had
started
forth
and
returned
upon
itself
in
dark
courses
*NL*
and
eddies
,
wearying
him
in
the
end
until
the
pleasantry
of
the
prefect
*NL*
and
the
painted
little
boy
had
drawn
from
him
a
movement
of
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
So
you
may
as
well
admit
,
Heron
went
on
,
that
we
've
fairly
found
you
*NL*
out
this
time
.
You
ca
n't
play
the
saint
on
me
any
more
,
that
's
one
sure
*NL*
five
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
soft
peal
of
mirthless
laughter
escaped
from
his
lips
and
,
bending
*NL*
down
as
before
,
he
struck
Stephen
lightly
across
the
calf
of
the
leg
*NL*
with
his
cane
,
as
if
in
jesting
reproof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
's
moment
of
anger
had
already
passed
.
He
was
neither
flattered
*NL*
nor
confused
,
but
simply
wished
the
banter
to
end
.
He
scarcely
resented
*NL*
what
had
seemed
to
him
a
silly
indelicateness
for
he
knew
that
the
*NL*
adventure
in
his
mind
stood
in
no
danger
from
these
words
:
and
his
face
*NL*
mirrored
his
rival
's
false
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Admit
!
repeated
Heron
,
striking
him
again
with
his
cane
across
the
*NL*
calf
of
the
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stroke
was
playful
but
not
so
lightly
given
as
the
first
one
had
*NL*
been
.
Stephen
felt
the
skin
tingle
and
glow
slightly
and
almost
*NL*
painlessly
;
and
,
bowing
submissively
,
as
if
to
meet
his
companion
's
*NL*
jesting
mood
,
began
to
recite
the
CONFITEOR
.
The
episode
ended
well
,
*NL*
for
both
Heron
and
Wallis
laughed
indulgently
at
the
irreverence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
confession
came
only
from
Stephen
's
lips
and
,
while
they
spoke
the
*NL*
words
,
a
sudden
memory
had
carried
him
to
another
scene
called
up
,
as
*NL*
if
by
magic
,
at
the
moment
when
he
had
noted
the
faint
cruel
dimples
at
*NL*
the
corners
of
Heron
's
smiling
lips
and
had
felt
the
familiar
stroke
of
*NL*
the
cane
against
his
calf
and
had
heard
the
familiar
word
of
*NL*
admonition
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Admit
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
towards
the
close
of
his
first
term
in
the
college
when
he
was
*NL*
in
number
six
.
His
sensitive
nature
was
still
smarting
under
the
lashes
*NL*
of
an
undivined
and
squalid
way
of
life
.
His
soul
was
still
disquieted
*NL*
and
cast
down
by
the
dull
phenomenon
of
Dublin
.
He
had
emerged
from
a
*NL*
two
years
'
spell
of
revery
to
find
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
new
scene
,
*NL*
every
event
and
figure
of
which
affected
him
intimately
,
disheartened
*NL*
him
or
allured
and
,
whether
alluring
or
disheartening
,
filled
him
*NL*
always
with
unrest
and
bitter
thoughts
.
All
the
leisure
which
his
*NL*
school
life
left
him
was
passed
in
the
company
of
subversive
writers
*NL*
whose
jibes
and
violence
of
speech
set
up
a
ferment
in
his
brain
before
*NL*
they
passed
out
of
it
into
his
crude
writings
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
essay
was
for
him
the
chief
labour
of
his
week
and
every
Tuesday
,
*NL*
as
he
marched
from
home
to
the
school
,
he
read
his
fate
in
the
*NL*
incidents
of
the
way
,
pitting
himself
against
some
figure
ahead
of
him
*NL*
and
quickening
his
pace
to
outstrip
it
before
a
certain
goal
was
*NL*
reached
or
planting
his
steps
scrupulously
in
the
spaces
of
the
*NL*
patchwork
of
the
pathway
and
telling
himself
that
he
would
be
first
and
*NL*
not
first
in
the
weekly
essay
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
certain
Tuesday
the
course
of
his
triumphs
was
rudely
broken
.
Mr
*NL*
Tate
,
the
English
master
,
pointed
his
finger
at
him
and
said
bluntly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
fellow
has
heresy
in
his
essay
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hush
fell
on
the
class
.
Mr
Tate
did
not
break
it
but
dug
with
his
*NL*
hand
between
his
thighs
while
his
heavily
starched
linen
creaked
about
*NL*
his
neck
and
wrists
.
Stephen
did
not
look
up
.
It
was
a
raw
spring
*NL*
morning
and
his
eyes
were
still
smarting
and
weak
.
He
was
conscious
of
*NL*
failure
and
of
detection
,
of
the
squalor
of
his
own
mind
and
home
,
and
*NL*
felt
against
his
neck
the
raw
edge
of
his
turned
and
jagged
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
loud
laugh
from
Mr
Tate
set
the
class
more
at
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Perhaps
you
did
n't
know
that
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
?
asked
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Tate
withdrew
his
delving
hand
and
spread
out
the
essay
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
.
It
's
about
the
Creator
and
the
soul
.
Rrm
...
rrm
...
rrm
...
Ah
!
*NL*
WITHOUT
A
POSSIBILITY
OF
EVER
APPROACHING
NEARER
.
That
's
heresy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
meant
WITHOUT
A
POSSIBILITY
OF
EVER
REACHING
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
submission
and
Mr
Tate
,
appeased
,
folded
up
the
essay
and
*NL*
passed
it
across
to
him
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
O.
.
.
Ah
!
EVER
REACHING
.
That
's
another
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
class
was
not
so
soon
appeased
.
Though
nobody
spoke
to
him
of
*NL*
the
affair
after
class
he
could
feel
about
him
a
vague
general
*NL*
malignant
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
nights
after
this
public
chiding
he
was
walking
with
a
letter
*NL*
along
the
Drumcondra
Road
when
he
heard
a
voice
cry
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Halt
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
and
saw
three
boys
of
his
own
class
coming
towards
him
in
the
*NL*
dusk
.
It
was
Heron
who
had
called
out
and
,
as
he
marched
forward
*NL*
between
his
two
attendants
,
he
cleft
the
air
before
him
with
a
thin
*NL*
cane
in
time
to
their
steps
.
Boland
,
his
friend
,
marched
beside
him
,
a
*NL*
large
grin
on
his
face
,
while
Nash
came
on
a
few
steps
behind
,
blowing
*NL*
from
the
pace
and
wagging
his
great
red
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
boys
had
turned
into
Clonliffe
Road
together
they
began
*NL*
to
speak
about
books
and
writers
,
saying
what
books
they
were
reading
*NL*
and
how
many
books
there
were
in
their
fathers
'
bookcases
at
home
.
*NL*
Stephen
listened
to
them
in
some
wonderment
for
Boland
was
the
dunce
*NL*
and
Nash
the
idler
of
the
class
.
In
fact
,
after
some
talk
about
their
*NL*
favourite
writers
,
Nash
declared
for
Captain
Marryat
who
,
he
said
,
was
*NL*
the
greatest
writer
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Fudge
!
said
Heron
.
Ask
Dedalus
.
Who
is
the
greatest
writer
,
Dedalus
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
noted
the
mockery
in
the
question
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
prose
do
you
mean
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Newman
,
I
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
it
Cardinal
Newman
?
asked
Boland
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
answered
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grin
broadened
on
Nash
's
freckled
face
as
he
turned
to
Stephen
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
do
you
like
Cardinal
Newman
,
Dedalus
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
many
say
that
Newman
has
the
best
prose
style
,
Heron
said
to
the
*NL*
other
two
in
explanation
,
of
course
he
's
not
a
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
who
is
the
best
poet
,
Heron
?
asked
Boland
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Lord
Tennyson
,
of
course
,
answered
Heron
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
yes
,
Lord
Tennyson
,
said
Nash
.
We
have
all
his
poetry
at
home
in
a
*NL*
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Stephen
forgot
the
silent
vows
he
had
been
making
and
burst
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tennyson
a
poet
!
Why
,
he
's
only
a
rhymester
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
get
out
!
said
Heron
.
Everyone
knows
that
Tennyson
is
the
greatest
*NL*
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
who
do
you
think
is
the
greatest
poet
?
asked
Boland
,
nudging
his
*NL*
neighbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Byron
,
of
course
,
answered
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heron
gave
the
lead
and
all
three
joined
in
a
scornful
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
are
you
laughing
at
?
asked
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
,
said
Heron
.
Byron
the
greatest
poet
!
He
's
only
a
poet
for
*NL*
uneducated
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
must
be
a
fine
poet
!
said
Boland
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
may
keep
your
mouth
shut
,
said
Stephen
,
turning
on
him
boldly
.
*NL*
All
you
know
about
poetry
is
what
you
wrote
up
on
the
slates
in
the
*NL*
yard
and
were
going
to
be
sent
to
the
loft
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boland
,
in
fact
,
was
said
to
have
written
on
the
slates
in
the
yard
a
*NL*
couplet
about
a
classmate
of
his
who
often
rode
home
from
the
college
*NL*
on
a
pony
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
Tyson
was
riding
into
Jerusalem
*NL*
He
fell
and
hurt
his
Alec
Kafoozelum
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
thrust
put
the
two
lieutenants
to
silence
but
Heron
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
any
case
Byron
was
a
heretic
and
immoral
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
n't
care
what
he
was
,
cried
Stephen
hotly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
do
n't
care
whether
he
was
a
heretic
or
not
?
said
Nash
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
do
you
know
about
it
?
shouted
Stephen
.
You
never
read
a
line
of
*NL*
anything
in
your
life
except
a
trans
,
or
Boland
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
that
Byron
was
a
bad
man
,
said
Boland
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
,
catch
hold
of
this
heretic
,
Heron
called
out
.
In
a
moment
*NL*
Stephen
was
a
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tate
made
you
buck
up
the
other
day
,
Heron
went
on
,
about
the
heresy
*NL*
in
your
essay
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
tell
him
tomorrow
,
said
Boland
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Will
you
?
said
Stephen
.
You
'd
be
afraid
to
open
your
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Afraid
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
.
Afraid
of
your
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Behave
yourself
!
cried
Heron
,
cutting
at
Stephen
's
legs
with
his
*NL*
cane
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
signal
for
their
onset
.
Nash
pinioned
his
arms
behind
while
*NL*
Boland
seized
a
long
cabbage
stump
which
was
lying
in
the
gutter
.
*NL*
Struggling
and
kicking
under
the
cuts
of
the
cane
and
the
blows
of
the
*NL*
knotty
stump
Stephen
was
borne
back
against
a
barbed
wire
fence
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Admit
that
Byron
was
no
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Admit
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Admit
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
.
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
after
a
fury
of
plunges
he
wrenched
himself
free
.
His
*NL*
tormentors
set
off
towards
Jones
's
Road
,
laughing
and
jeering
at
him
,
*NL*
while
he
,
half
blinded
with
tears
,
stumbled
on
,
clenching
his
fists
*NL*
madly
and
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
still
repeating
the
CONFITEOR
amid
the
indulgent
laughter
*NL*
of
his
hearers
and
while
the
scenes
of
that
malignant
episode
were
*NL*
still
passing
sharply
and
swiftly
before
his
mind
he
wondered
why
he
*NL*
bore
no
malice
now
to
those
who
had
tormented
him
.
He
had
not
forgotten
*NL*
a
whit
of
their
cowardice
and
cruelty
but
the
memory
of
it
called
forth
*NL*
no
anger
from
him
.
All
the
descriptions
of
fierce
love
and
hatred
which
*NL*
he
had
met
in
books
had
seemed
to
him
therefore
unreal
.
Even
that
night
*NL*
as
he
stumbled
homewards
along
Jones
's
Road
he
had
felt
that
some
power
*NL*
was
divesting
him
of
that
sudden-woven
anger
as
easily
as
a
fruit
is
*NL*
divested
of
its
soft
ripe
peel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
standing
with
his
two
companions
at
the
end
of
the
shed
*NL*
listening
idly
to
their
talk
or
to
the
bursts
of
applause
in
the
*NL*
theatre
.
She
was
sitting
there
among
the
others
perhaps
waiting
for
him
*NL*
to
appear
.
He
tried
to
recall
her
appearance
but
could
not
.
He
could
*NL*
remember
only
that
she
had
worn
a
shawl
about
her
head
like
a
cowl
and
*NL*
that
her
dark
eyes
had
invited
and
unnerved
him
.
He
wondered
had
he
*NL*
been
in
her
thoughts
as
she
had
been
in
his
.
Then
in
the
dark
and
*NL*
unseen
by
the
other
two
he
rested
the
tips
of
the
fingers
of
one
hand
*NL*
upon
the
palm
of
the
other
hand
,
scarcely
touching
it
lightly
.
But
the
*NL*
pressure
of
her
fingers
had
been
lighter
and
steadier
:
and
suddenly
the
*NL*
memory
of
their
touch
traversed
his
brain
and
body
like
an
invisible
*NL*
wave
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
boy
came
towards
them
,
running
along
under
the
shed
.
He
was
excited
*NL*
and
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
Dedalus
,
he
cried
,
Doyle
is
in
a
great
bake
about
you
.
You
're
to
*NL*
go
in
at
once
and
get
dressed
for
the
play
.
Hurry
up
,
you
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
coming
now
,
said
Heron
to
the
messenger
with
a
haughty
drawl
,
*NL*
when
he
wants
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
turned
to
Heron
and
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
Doyle
is
in
an
awful
bake
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Will
you
tell
Doyle
with
my
best
compliments
that
I
damned
his
eyes
?
*NL*
answered
Heron
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
I
must
go
now
,
said
Stephen
,
who
cared
little
for
such
points
*NL*
of
honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
would
n't
,
said
Heron
,
damn
me
if
I
would
.
That
's
no
way
to
send
*NL*
for
one
of
the
senior
boys
.
In
a
bake
,
indeed
!
I
think
it
's
quite
*NL*
enough
that
you
're
taking
a
part
in
his
bally
old
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
spirit
of
quarrelsome
comradeship
which
he
had
observed
lately
in
*NL*
his
rival
had
not
seduced
Stephen
from
his
habits
of
quiet
obedience
.
*NL*
He
mistrusted
the
turbulence
and
doubted
the
sincerity
of
such
*NL*
comradeship
which
seemed
to
him
a
sorry
anticipation
of
manhood
.
The
*NL*
question
of
honour
here
raised
was
,
like
all
such
questions
,
trivial
to
*NL*
him
.
While
his
mind
had
been
pursuing
its
intangible
phantoms
and
*NL*
turning
in
irresolution
from
such
pursuit
he
had
heard
about
him
the
*NL*
constant
voices
of
his
father
and
of
his
masters
,
urging
him
to
be
a
*NL*
gentleman
above
all
things
and
urging
him
to
be
a
good
catholic
above
all
*NL*
things
.
These
voices
had
now
come
to
be
hollow-sounding
in
his
ears
.
When
*NL*
the
gymnasium
had
been
opened
he
had
heard
another
voice
urging
him
to
be
*NL*
strong
and
manly
and
healthy
and
when
the
movement
towards
national
*NL*
revival
had
begun
to
be
felt
in
the
college
yet
another
voice
had
bidden
*NL*
him
be
true
to
his
country
and
help
to
raise
up
her
language
and
*NL*
tradition
.
In
the
profane
world
,
as
he
foresaw
,
a
worldly
voice
would
bid
*NL*
him
raise
up
his
father
's
fallen
state
by
his
labours
and
,
meanwhile
,
the
*NL*
voice
of
his
school
comrades
urged
him
to
be
a
decent
fellow
,
to
shield
*NL*
others
from
blame
or
to
beg
them
off
and
to
do
his
best
to
get
free
days
*NL*
for
the
school
.
And
it
was
the
din
of
all
these
hollow-sounding
voices
*NL*
that
made
him
halt
irresolutely
in
the
pursuit
of
phantoms
.
He
gave
them
*NL*
ear
only
for
a
time
but
he
was
happy
only
when
he
was
far
from
them
,
*NL*
beyond
their
call
,
alone
or
in
the
company
of
phantasmal
comrades
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
vestry
a
plump
fresh-faced
jesuit
and
an
elderly
man
,
in
shabby
*NL*
blue
clothes
,
were
dabbling
in
a
case
of
paints
and
chalks
.
The
boys
*NL*
who
had
been
painted
walked
about
or
stood
still
awkwardly
,
touching
*NL*
their
faces
in
a
gingerly
fashion
with
their
furtive
fingertips
.
In
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
vestry
a
young
jesuit
,
who
was
then
on
a
visit
to
the
*NL*
college
,
stood
rocking
himself
rhythmically
from
the
tips
of
his
toes
*NL*
to
his
heels
and
back
again
,
his
hands
thrust
well
forward
into
his
*NL*
side-pockets
.
His
small
head
set
off
with
glossy
red
curls
and
his
*NL*
newly
shaven
face
agreed
well
with
the
spotless
decency
of
his
soutane
*NL*
and
with
his
spotless
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
watched
this
swaying
form
and
tried
to
read
for
himself
the
*NL*
legend
of
the
priest
's
mocking
smile
there
came
into
Stephen
's
memory
a
*NL*
saying
which
he
had
heard
from
his
father
before
he
had
been
sent
to
*NL*
Clongowes
,
that
you
could
always
tell
a
jesuit
by
the
style
of
his
*NL*
clothes
.
At
the
same
moment
he
thought
he
saw
a
likeness
between
his
*NL*
father
's
mind
and
that
of
this
smiling
well-dressed
priest
:
and
he
was
*NL*
aware
of
some
desecration
of
the
priest
's
office
or
of
the
vestry
*NL*
itself
whose
silence
was
now
routed
by
loud
talk
and
joking
and
its
air
*NL*
pungent
with
the
smells
of
the
gas-jets
and
the
grease
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
his
forehead
was
being
wrinkled
and
his
jaws
painted
black
and
*NL*
blue
by
the
elderly
man
,
he
listened
distractedly
to
the
voice
of
the
*NL*
plump
young
jesuit
which
bade
him
speak
up
and
make
his
points
clearly
.
*NL*
He
could
hear
the
band
playing
THE
LILY
OF
KILLARNEY
and
knew
that
in
a
*NL*
few
moments
the
curtain
would
go
up
.
He
felt
no
stage
fright
but
the
*NL*
thought
of
the
part
he
had
to
play
humiliated
him
.
A
remembrance
of
*NL*
some
of
his
lines
made
a
sudden
flush
rise
to
his
painted
cheeks
.
He
*NL*
saw
her
serious
alluring
eyes
watching
him
from
among
the
audience
and
*NL*
their
image
at
once
swept
away
his
scruples
,
leaving
his
will
compact
.
*NL*
Another
nature
seemed
to
have
been
lent
him
:
the
infection
of
the
*NL*
excitement
and
youth
about
him
entered
into
and
transformed
his
moody
*NL*
mistrustfulness
.
For
one
rare
moment
he
seemed
to
be
clothed
in
the
*NL*
real
apparel
of
boyhood
:
and
,
as
he
stood
in
the
wings
among
the
other
*NL*
players
,
he
shared
the
common
mirth
amid
which
the
drop
scene
was
*NL*
hauled
upwards
by
two
able-bodied
priests
with
violent
jerks
and
all
awry
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
after
he
found
himself
on
the
stage
amid
the
garish
gas
*NL*
and
the
dim
scenery
,
acting
before
the
innumerable
faces
of
the
void
.
*NL*
It
surprised
him
to
see
that
the
play
which
he
had
known
at
rehearsals
*NL*
for
a
disjointed
lifeless
thing
had
suddenly
assumed
a
life
of
its
own
.
*NL*
It
seemed
now
to
play
itself
,
he
and
his
fellow
actors
aiding
it
with
*NL*
their
parts
.
When
the
curtain
fell
on
the
last
scene
he
heard
the
void
*NL*
filled
with
applause
and
,
through
a
rift
in
a
side
scene
,
saw
the
*NL*
simple
body
before
which
he
had
acted
magically
deformed
,
the
void
of
*NL*
faces
breaking
at
all
points
and
falling
asunder
into
busy
groups
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
stage
quickly
and
rid
himself
of
his
mummery
and
passed
out
*NL*
through
the
chapel
into
the
college
garden
.
Now
that
the
play
was
over
*NL*
his
nerves
cried
for
some
further
adventure
.
He
hurried
onwards
as
if
*NL*
to
overtake
it
.
The
doors
of
the
theatre
were
all
open
and
the
audience
*NL*
had
emptied
out
.
On
the
lines
which
he
had
fancied
the
moorings
of
an
*NL*
ark
a
few
lanterns
swung
in
the
night
breeze
,
flickering
cheerlessly
.
*NL*
He
mounted
the
steps
from
the
garden
in
haste
,
eager
that
some
prey
*NL*
should
not
elude
him
,
and
forced
his
way
through
the
crowd
in
the
hall
*NL*
and
past
the
two
jesuits
who
stood
watching
the
exodus
and
bowing
and
*NL*
shaking
hands
with
the
visitors
.
He
pushed
onward
nervously
,
feigning
a
*NL*
still
greater
haste
and
faintly
conscious
of
the
smiles
and
stares
and
*NL*
nudges
which
his
powdered
head
left
in
its
wake
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
out
on
the
steps
he
saw
his
family
waiting
for
him
at
the
*NL*
first
lamp
.
In
a
glance
he
noted
that
every
figure
of
the
group
was
*NL*
familiar
and
ran
down
the
steps
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
to
leave
a
message
down
in
George
's
Street
,
he
said
to
his
*NL*
father
quickly
.
I
'll
be
home
after
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
waiting
for
his
father
's
questions
he
ran
across
the
road
and
*NL*
began
to
walk
at
breakneck
speed
down
the
hill
.
He
hardly
knew
where
he
*NL*
was
walking
.
Pride
and
hope
and
desire
like
crushed
herbs
in
his
heart
*NL*
sent
up
vapours
of
maddening
incense
before
the
eyes
of
his
mind
.
He
*NL*
strode
down
the
hill
amid
the
tumult
of
sudden-risen
vapours
of
wounded
*NL*
pride
and
fallen
hope
and
baffled
desire
.
They
streamed
upwards
before
*NL*
his
anguished
eyes
in
dense
and
maddening
fumes
and
passed
away
above
*NL*
him
till
at
last
the
air
was
clear
and
cold
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
film
still
veiled
his
eyes
but
they
burned
no
longer
.
A
power
,
akin
*NL*
to
that
which
had
often
made
anger
or
resentment
fall
from
him
,
brought
*NL*
his
steps
to
rest
.
He
stood
still
and
gazed
up
at
the
sombre
porch
of
*NL*
the
morgue
and
from
that
to
the
dark
cobbled
laneway
at
its
side
.
He
*NL*
saw
the
word
LOTTS
on
the
wall
of
the
lane
and
breathed
slowly
the
rank
*NL*
heavy
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
horse
piss
and
rotted
straw
,
he
thought
.
It
is
a
good
odour
to
*NL*
breathe
.
It
will
calm
my
heart
.
My
heart
is
quite
calm
now
.
I
will
go
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
was
once
again
seated
beside
his
father
in
the
corner
of
a
*NL*
railway
carriage
at
Kingsbridge
.
He
was
travelling
with
his
father
by
*NL*
the
night
mail
to
Cork
.
As
the
train
steamed
out
of
the
station
he
*NL*
recalled
his
childish
wonder
of
years
before
and
every
event
of
his
*NL*
first
day
at
Clongowes
.
But
he
felt
no
wonder
now
.
He
saw
the
darkening
*NL*
lands
slipping
away
past
him
,
the
silent
telegraph-poles
passing
his
*NL*
window
swiftly
every
four
seconds
,
the
little
glimmering
stations
,
*NL*
manned
by
a
few
silent
sentries
,
flung
by
the
mail
behind
her
and
*NL*
twinkling
for
a
moment
in
the
darkness
like
fiery
grains
flung
*NL*
backwards
by
a
runner
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
without
sympathy
to
his
father
's
evocation
of
Cork
and
of
*NL*
scenes
of
his
youth
,
a
tale
broken
by
sighs
or
draughts
from
his
pocket
*NL*
flask
whenever
the
image
of
some
dead
friend
appeared
in
it
or
whenever
*NL*
the
evoker
remembered
suddenly
the
purpose
of
his
actual
visit
.
Stephen
*NL*
heard
but
could
feel
no
pity
.
The
images
of
the
dead
were
all
strangers
*NL*
to
him
save
that
of
uncle
Charles
,
an
image
which
had
lately
been
*NL*
fading
out
of
memory
.
He
knew
,
however
,
that
his
father
's
property
was
*NL*
going
to
be
sold
by
auction
,
and
in
the
manner
of
his
own
dispossession
*NL*
he
felt
the
world
give
the
lie
rudely
to
his
phantasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Maryborough
he
fell
asleep
.
When
he
awoke
the
train
had
passed
out
*NL*
of
Mallow
and
his
father
was
stretched
asleep
on
the
other
seat
.
The
*NL*
cold
light
of
the
dawn
lay
over
the
country
,
over
the
unpeopled
fields
*NL*
and
the
closed
cottages
.
The
terror
of
sleep
fascinated
his
mind
as
he
*NL*
watched
the
silent
country
or
heard
from
time
to
time
his
father
's
deep
*NL*
breath
or
sudden
sleepy
movement
.
The
neighbourhood
of
unseen
sleepers
*NL*
filled
him
with
strange
dread
,
as
though
they
could
harm
him
,
and
he
*NL*
prayed
that
the
day
might
come
quickly
.
His
prayer
,
addressed
neither
*NL*
to
God
nor
saint
,
began
with
a
shiver
,
as
the
chilly
morning
breeze
*NL*
crept
through
the
chink
of
the
carriage
door
to
his
feet
,
and
ended
in
*NL*
a
trail
of
foolish
words
which
he
made
to
fit
the
insistent
rhythm
of
*NL*
the
train
;
and
silently
,
at
intervals
of
four
seconds
,
the
*NL*
telegraph-poles
held
the
galloping
notes
of
the
music
between
punctual
*NL*
bars
.
This
furious
music
allayed
his
dread
and
,
leaning
against
the
*NL*
windowledge
,
he
let
his
eyelids
close
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
in
a
jingle
across
Cork
while
it
was
still
early
morning
and
*NL*
Stephen
finished
his
sleep
in
a
bedroom
of
the
Victoria
Hotel
.
The
*NL*
bright
warm
sunlight
was
streaming
through
the
window
and
he
could
hear
*NL*
the
din
of
traffic
.
His
father
was
standing
before
the
dressing-table
,
*NL*
examining
his
hair
and
face
and
moustache
with
great
care
,
craning
his
*NL*
neck
across
the
water-jug
and
drawing
it
back
sideways
to
see
the
better
.
*NL*
While
he
did
so
he
sang
softly
to
himself
with
quaint
accent
and
phrasing
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
youth
and
folly
*NL*
Makes
young
men
marry
,
*NL*
So
here
,
my
love
,
I
'll
*NL*
No
longer
stay
.
*NL*
What
ca
n't
be
cured
,
sure
,
*NL*
Must
be
injured
,
sure
,
*NL*
So
I
'll
go
to
*NL*
Amerikay
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
love
she
's
handsome
,
*NL*
My
love
she
's
bony
:
*NL*
She
's
like
good
whisky
*NL*
When
it
is
new
;
*NL*
But
when
't
is
old
*NL*
And
growing
cold
*NL*
It
fades
and
dies
like
*NL*
The
mountain
dew
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
consciousness
of
the
warm
sunny
city
outside
his
window
and
the
*NL*
tender
tremors
with
which
his
father
's
voice
festooned
the
strange
sad
*NL*
happy
air
,
drove
off
all
the
mists
of
the
night
's
ill
humour
from
*NL*
Stephen
's
brain
.
He
got
up
quickly
to
dress
and
,
when
the
song
had
*NL*
ended
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
much
prettier
than
any
of
your
other
COME-ALL-YOUS
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
think
so
?
asked
Mr
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
like
it
,
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
a
pretty
old
air
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
,
twirling
the
points
of
his
*NL*
moustache
.
Ah
,
but
you
should
have
heard
Mick
Lacy
sing
it
!
Poor
Mick
*NL*
Lacy
!
He
had
little
turns
for
it
,
grace
notes
that
he
used
to
put
in
*NL*
that
I
have
n't
got
.
That
was
the
boy
who
could
sing
a
COME-ALL-YOU
,
if
*NL*
you
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
had
ordered
drisheens
for
breakfast
and
during
the
meal
he
*NL*
cross-examined
the
waiter
for
local
news
.
For
the
most
part
they
spoke
*NL*
at
cross
purposes
when
a
name
was
mentioned
,
the
waiter
having
in
mind
*NL*
the
present
holder
and
Mr
Dedalus
his
father
or
perhaps
his
*NL*
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
I
hope
they
have
n't
moved
the
Queen
's
College
anyhow
,
said
Mr
*NL*
Dedalus
,
for
I
want
to
show
it
to
this
youngster
of
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Along
the
Mardyke
the
trees
were
in
bloom
.
They
entered
the
grounds
of
*NL*
the
college
and
were
led
by
the
garrulous
porter
across
the
quadrangle
.
*NL*
But
their
progress
across
the
gravel
was
brought
to
a
halt
after
every
*NL*
dozen
or
so
paces
by
some
reply
of
the
porter
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
,
do
you
tell
me
so
?
And
is
poor
Pottlebelly
dead
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
sir
.
Dead
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
these
halts
Stephen
stood
awkwardly
behind
the
two
men
,
weary
of
*NL*
the
subject
and
waiting
restlessly
for
the
slow
march
to
begin
again
.
*NL*
By
the
time
they
had
crossed
the
quadrangle
his
restlessness
had
risen
*NL*
to
fever
.
He
wondered
how
his
father
,
whom
he
knew
for
a
shrewd
*NL*
suspicious
man
,
could
be
duped
by
the
servile
manners
of
the
porter
;
*NL*
and
the
lively
southern
speech
which
had
entertained
him
all
the
*NL*
morning
now
irritated
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
into
the
anatomy
theatre
where
Mr
Dedalus
,
the
porter
*NL*
aiding
him
,
searched
the
desks
for
his
initials
.
Stephen
remained
in
*NL*
the
background
,
depressed
more
than
ever
by
the
darkness
and
silence
of
*NL*
the
theatre
and
by
the
air
it
wore
of
jaded
and
formal
study
.
On
the
*NL*
desk
he
read
the
word
FOETUS
cut
several
times
in
the
dark
stained
*NL*
wood
.
The
sudden
legend
startled
his
blood
:
he
seemed
to
feel
the
*NL*
absent
students
of
the
college
about
him
and
to
shrink
from
their
*NL*
company
.
A
vision
of
their
life
,
which
his
father
's
words
had
been
*NL*
powerless
to
evoke
,
sprang
up
before
him
out
of
the
word
cut
in
the
*NL*
desk
.
A
broad-shouldered
student
with
a
moustache
was
cutting
in
the
*NL*
letters
with
a
jack-knife
,
seriously
.
Other
students
stood
or
sat
near
*NL*
him
laughing
at
his
handiwork
.
One
jogged
his
elbow
.
The
big
student
*NL*
turned
on
him
,
frowning
.
He
was
dressed
in
loose
grey
clothes
and
had
*NL*
tan
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
's
name
was
called
.
He
hurried
down
the
steps
of
the
theatre
so
*NL*
as
to
be
as
far
away
from
the
vision
as
he
could
be
and
,
peering
*NL*
closely
at
his
father
's
initials
,
hid
his
flushed
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
word
and
the
vision
capered
before
his
eyes
as
he
walked
back
*NL*
across
the
quadrangle
and
towards
the
college
gate
.
It
shocked
him
to
*NL*
find
in
the
outer
world
a
trace
of
what
he
had
deemed
till
then
a
*NL*
brutish
and
individual
malady
of
his
own
mind
.
His
monstrous
reveries
*NL*
came
thronging
into
his
memory
.
They
too
had
sprung
up
before
him
,
*NL*
suddenly
and
furiously
,
out
of
mere
words
.
He
had
soon
given
in
to
them
*NL*
and
allowed
them
to
sweep
across
and
abase
his
intellect
,
wondering
*NL*
always
where
they
came
from
,
from
what
den
of
monstrous
images
,
and
*NL*
always
weak
and
humble
towards
others
,
restless
and
sickened
of
himself
*NL*
when
they
had
swept
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
bedad
!
And
there
's
the
Groceries
sure
enough
!
cried
Mr
Dedalus
.
*NL*
You
often
heard
me
speak
of
the
Groceries
,
did
n't
you
,
Stephen
.
Many
's
*NL*
the
time
we
went
down
there
when
our
names
had
been
marked
,
a
crowd
of
*NL*
us
,
Harry
Peard
and
little
Jack
Mountain
and
Bob
Dyas
and
Maurice
*NL*
Moriarty
,
the
Frenchman
,
and
Tom
O'Grady
and
Mick
Lacy
that
I
told
you
*NL*
of
this
morning
and
Joey
Corbet
and
poor
little
good-hearted
Johnny
*NL*
Keevers
of
the
Tantiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
leaves
of
the
trees
along
the
Mardyke
were
astir
and
whispering
in
*NL*
the
sunlight
.
A
team
of
cricketers
passed
,
agile
young
men
in
flannels
*NL*
and
blazers
,
one
of
them
carrying
the
long
green
wicket-bag
.
In
a
quiet
*NL*
bystreet
a
German
band
of
five
players
in
faded
uniforms
and
with
*NL*
battered
brass
instruments
was
playing
to
an
audience
of
street
arabs
*NL*
and
leisurely
messenger
boys
.
A
maid
in
a
white
cap
and
apron
was
*NL*
watering
a
box
of
plants
on
a
sill
which
shone
like
a
slab
of
limestone
*NL*
in
the
warm
glare
.
From
another
window
open
to
the
air
came
the
sound
*NL*
of
a
piano
,
scale
after
scale
rising
into
the
treble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
walked
on
at
his
father
's
side
,
listening
to
stories
he
had
*NL*
heard
before
,
hearing
again
the
names
of
the
scattered
and
dead
*NL*
revellers
who
had
been
the
companions
of
his
father
's
youth
.
And
a
*NL*
faint
sickness
sighed
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
recalled
his
own
equivocal
position
in
Belvedere
,
a
free
boy
,
a
*NL*
leader
afraid
of
his
own
authority
,
proud
and
sensitive
and
suspicious
,
*NL*
battling
against
the
squalor
of
his
life
and
against
the
riot
of
his
*NL*
mind
.
The
letters
cut
in
the
stained
wood
of
the
desk
stared
upon
him
,
*NL*
mocking
his
bodily
weakness
and
futile
enthusiasms
and
making
him
*NL*
loathe
himself
for
his
own
mad
and
filthy
orgies
.
The
spittle
in
his
*NL*
throat
grew
bitter
and
foul
to
swallow
and
the
faint
sickness
climbed
*NL*
to
his
brain
so
that
for
a
moment
he
closed
his
eyes
and
walked
on
in
*NL*
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
still
hear
his
father
's
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
When
you
kick
out
for
yourself
,
Stephen
--
as
I
daresay
you
will
one
*NL*
of
these
days
--
remember
,
whatever
you
do
,
to
mix
with
gentlemen
.
When
*NL*
I
was
a
young
fellow
I
tell
you
I
enjoyed
myself
.
I
mixed
with
fine
*NL*
decent
fellows
.
Everyone
of
us
could
do
something
.
One
fellow
had
a
*NL*
good
voice
,
another
fellow
was
a
good
actor
,
another
could
sing
a
good
*NL*
comic
song
,
another
was
a
good
oarsman
or
a
good
racket
player
,
another
*NL*
could
tell
a
good
story
and
so
on
.
We
kept
the
ball
rolling
anyhow
and
*NL*
enjoyed
ourselves
and
saw
a
bit
of
life
and
we
were
none
the
worse
of
*NL*
it
either
.
But
we
were
all
gentlemen
,
Stephen
--
at
least
I
hope
we
were
--
and
*NL*
bloody
good
honest
Irishmen
too
.
That
's
the
kind
of
fellows
I
want
*NL*
you
to
associate
with
,
fellows
of
the
right
kidney
.
I
'm
talking
to
*NL*
you
as
a
friend
,
Stephen
.
I
do
n't
believe
a
son
should
be
afraid
of
his
*NL*
father
.
No
,
I
treat
you
as
your
grandfather
treated
me
when
I
was
a
*NL*
young
chap
.
We
were
more
like
brothers
than
father
and
son
.
I
'll
never
*NL*
forget
the
first
day
he
caught
me
smoking
.
I
was
standing
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
South
Terrace
one
day
with
some
maneens
like
myself
and
sure
we
*NL*
thought
we
were
grand
fellows
because
we
had
pipes
stuck
in
the
corners
*NL*
of
our
mouths
.
Suddenly
the
governor
passed
.
He
did
n't
say
a
word
,
or
*NL*
stop
even
.
But
the
next
day
,
Sunday
,
we
were
out
for
a
walk
together
*NL*
and
when
we
were
coming
home
he
took
out
his
cigar
case
and
said
:
--
By
*NL*
the
by
,
Simon
,
I
did
n't
know
you
smoked
,
or
something
like
that
.
--
Of
*NL*
course
I
tried
to
carry
it
off
as
best
I
could
.
--
If
you
want
a
good
*NL*
smoke
,
he
said
,
try
one
of
these
cigars
.
An
American
captain
made
me
a
*NL*
present
of
them
last
night
in
Queenstown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
heard
his
father
's
voice
break
into
a
laugh
which
was
almost
a
*NL*
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
was
the
handsomest
man
in
Cork
at
that
time
,
by
God
he
was
!
The
*NL*
women
used
to
stand
to
look
after
him
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
the
sob
passing
loudly
down
his
father
's
throat
and
opened
his
*NL*
eyes
with
a
nervous
impulse
.
The
sunlight
breaking
suddenly
on
his
*NL*
sight
turned
the
sky
and
clouds
into
a
fantastic
world
of
sombre
masses
*NL*
with
lakelike
spaces
of
dark
rosy
light
.
His
very
brain
was
sick
and
*NL*
powerless
.
He
could
scarcely
interpret
the
letters
of
the
signboards
of
*NL*
the
shops
.
By
his
monstrous
way
of
life
he
seemed
to
have
put
himself
*NL*
beyond
the
limits
of
reality
.
Nothing
moved
him
or
spoke
to
him
from
*NL*
the
real
world
unless
he
heard
in
it
an
echo
of
the
infuriated
cries
*NL*
within
him
.
He
could
respond
to
no
earthly
or
human
appeal
,
dumb
and
*NL*
insensible
to
the
call
of
summer
and
gladness
and
companionship
,
*NL*
wearied
and
dejected
by
his
father
's
voice
.
He
could
scarcely
recognize
*NL*
as
his
own
thoughts
,
and
repeated
slowly
to
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
Stephen
Dedalus
.
I
am
walking
beside
my
father
whose
name
is
*NL*
Simon
Dedalus
.
We
are
in
Cork
,
in
Ireland
.
Cork
is
a
city
.
Our
room
is
*NL*
in
the
Victoria
Hotel
.
Victoria
and
Stephen
and
Simon
.
Simon
and
*NL*
Stephen
and
Victoria
.
Names
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
memory
of
his
childhood
suddenly
grew
dim
.
He
tried
to
call
forth
*NL*
some
of
its
vivid
moments
but
could
not
.
He
recalled
only
names
.
Dante
,
*NL*
Parnell
,
Clane
,
Clongowes
.
A
little
boy
had
been
taught
geography
by
an
*NL*
old
woman
who
kept
two
brushes
in
her
wardrobe
.
Then
he
had
been
sent
*NL*
away
from
home
to
a
college
,
he
had
made
his
first
communion
and
eaten
*NL*
slim
jim
out
of
his
cricket
cap
and
watched
the
firelight
leaping
and
*NL*
dancing
on
the
wall
of
a
little
bedroom
in
the
infirmary
and
dreamed
of
*NL*
being
dead
,
of
mass
being
said
for
him
by
the
rector
in
a
black
and
*NL*
gold
cope
,
of
being
buried
then
in
the
little
graveyard
of
the
*NL*
community
off
the
main
avenue
of
limes
.
But
he
had
not
died
then
.
*NL*
Parnell
had
died
.
There
had
been
no
mass
for
the
dead
in
the
chapel
and
*NL*
no
procession
.
He
had
not
died
but
he
had
faded
out
like
a
film
in
the
*NL*
sun
.
He
had
been
lost
or
had
wandered
out
of
existence
for
he
no
longer
*NL*
existed
.
How
strange
to
think
of
him
passing
out
of
existence
in
such
a
*NL*
way
,
not
by
death
but
by
fading
out
in
the
sun
or
by
being
lost
and
*NL*
forgotten
somewhere
in
the
universe
!
It
was
strange
to
see
his
small
*NL*
body
appear
again
for
a
moment
:
a
little
boy
in
a
grey
belted
suit
.
His
*NL*
hands
were
in
his
side-pockets
and
his
trousers
were
tucked
in
at
the
*NL*
knees
by
elastic
bands
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
the
property
was
sold
Stephen
*NL*
followed
his
father
meekly
about
the
city
from
bar
to
bar
.
To
the
*NL*
sellers
in
the
market
,
to
the
barmen
and
barmaids
,
to
the
beggars
who
*NL*
importuned
him
for
a
lob
Mr
Dedalus
told
the
same
tale
--
that
he
was
an
*NL*
old
Corkonian
,
that
he
had
been
trying
for
thirty
years
to
get
rid
of
*NL*
his
Cork
accent
up
in
Dublin
and
that
Peter
Pickackafax
beside
him
was
*NL*
his
eldest
son
but
that
he
was
only
a
Dublin
jackeen
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
set
out
early
in
the
morning
from
Newcombe
's
coffee-house
,
*NL*
where
Mr
Dedalus
's
cup
had
rattled
noisily
against
its
saucer
,
and
*NL*
Stephen
had
tried
to
cover
that
shameful
sign
of
his
father
's
drinking
*NL*
bout
of
the
night
before
by
moving
his
chair
and
coughing
.
One
*NL*
humiliation
had
succeeded
another
--
the
false
smiles
of
the
market
*NL*
sellers
,
the
curvetings
and
oglings
of
the
barmaids
with
whom
his
*NL*
father
flirted
,
the
compliments
and
encouraging
words
of
his
father
's
*NL*
friends
.
They
had
told
him
that
he
had
a
great
look
of
his
grandfather
*NL*
and
Mr
Dedalus
had
agreed
that
he
was
an
ugly
likeness
.
They
had
*NL*
unearthed
traces
of
a
Cork
accent
in
his
speech
and
made
him
admit
that
*NL*
the
Lee
was
a
much
finer
river
than
the
Liffey
.
One
of
them
,
in
order
*NL*
to
put
his
Latin
to
the
proof
,
had
made
him
translate
short
passages
*NL*
from
Dilectus
and
asked
him
whether
it
was
correct
to
say
:
TEMPORA
*NL*
MUTANTUR
NOS
ET
MUTAMUR
IN
ILLIS
or
TEMPORA
MUTANTUR
ET
NOS
MUTAMUR
IN
*NL*
ILLIS
.
Another
,
a
brisk
old
man
,
whom
Mr
Dedalus
called
Johnny
Cashman
,
*NL*
had
covered
him
with
confusion
by
asking
him
to
say
which
were
*NL*
prettier
,
the
Dublin
girls
or
the
Cork
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
not
that
way
built
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
Leave
him
alone
.
He
's
a
*NL*
level-headed
thinking
boy
who
does
n't
bother
his
head
about
that
kind
*NL*
of
nonsense
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
he
's
not
his
father
's
son
,
said
the
little
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
n't
know
,
I
'm
sure
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
,
smiling
complacently
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Your
father
,
said
the
little
old
man
to
Stephen
,
was
the
boldest
flirt
*NL*
in
the
City
of
Cork
in
his
day
.
Do
you
know
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
looked
down
and
studied
the
tiled
floor
of
the
bar
into
which
*NL*
they
had
drifted
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
do
n't
be
putting
ideas
into
his
head
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
Leave
him
*NL*
to
his
Maker
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yerra
,
sure
I
would
n't
put
any
ideas
into
his
head
.
I
'm
old
enough
*NL*
to
be
his
grandfather
.
And
I
am
a
grandfather
,
said
the
little
old
man
*NL*
to
Stephen
.
Do
you
know
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
?
asked
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bedad
I
am
,
said
the
little
old
man
.
I
have
two
bouncing
*NL*
grandchildren
out
at
Sunday
's
Well
.
Now
,
then
!
What
age
do
you
think
I
*NL*
am
?
And
I
remember
seeing
your
grandfather
in
his
red
coat
riding
out
*NL*
to
hounds
.
That
was
before
you
were
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
or
thought
of
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bedad
I
did
,
repeated
the
little
old
man
.
And
,
more
than
that
,
I
can
*NL*
remember
even
your
great-grandfather
,
old
John
Stephen
Dedalus
,
and
a
*NL*
fierce
old
fire-eater
he
was
.
Now
,
then
!
There
's
a
memory
for
you
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
three
generations
--
four
generations
,
said
another
of
the
*NL*
company
.
Why
,
Johnny
Cashman
,
you
must
be
nearing
the
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
the
truth
,
said
the
little
old
man
.
I
'm
just
*NL*
twenty-seven
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
're
as
old
as
we
feel
,
Johnny
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
And
just
finish
*NL*
what
you
have
there
and
we
'll
have
another
.
Here
,
Tim
or
Tom
or
*NL*
whatever
your
name
is
,
give
us
the
same
again
here
.
By
God
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
feel
more
than
eighteen
myself
.
There
's
that
son
of
mine
there
not
half
*NL*
my
age
and
I
'm
a
better
man
than
he
is
any
day
of
the
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Draw
it
mild
now
,
Dedalus
.
I
think
it
's
time
for
you
to
take
a
back
*NL*
seat
,
said
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
by
God
!
asserted
Mr
Dedalus
.
I
'll
sing
a
tenor
song
against
him
*NL*
or
I
'll
vault
a
five-barred
gate
against
him
or
I
'll
run
with
him
after
*NL*
the
hounds
across
the
country
as
I
did
thirty
years
ago
along
with
the
*NL*
Kerry
Boy
and
the
best
man
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
he
'll
beat
you
here
,
said
the
little
old
man
,
tapping
his
*NL*
forehead
and
raising
his
glass
to
drain
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
I
hope
he
'll
be
as
good
a
man
as
his
father
.
That
's
all
I
can
*NL*
say
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
he
is
,
he
'll
do
,
said
the
little
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
thanks
be
to
God
,
Johnny
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
,
that
we
lived
so
long
*NL*
and
did
so
little
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
did
so
much
good
,
Simon
,
said
the
little
old
man
gravely
.
Thanks
*NL*
be
to
God
we
lived
so
long
and
did
so
much
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
watched
the
three
glasses
being
raised
from
the
counter
as
his
*NL*
father
and
his
two
cronies
drank
to
the
memory
of
their
past
.
An
abyss
*NL*
of
fortune
or
of
temperament
sundered
him
from
them
.
His
mind
seemed
*NL*
older
than
theirs
:
it
shone
coldly
on
their
strifes
and
happiness
and
*NL*
regrets
like
a
moon
upon
a
younger
earth
.
No
life
or
youth
stirred
in
*NL*
him
as
it
had
stirred
in
them
.
He
had
known
neither
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
companionship
with
others
nor
the
vigour
of
rude
male
health
nor
filial
*NL*
piety
.
Nothing
stirred
within
his
soul
but
a
cold
and
cruel
and
*NL*
loveless
lust
.
His
childhood
was
dead
or
lost
and
with
it
his
soul
*NL*
capable
of
simple
joys
and
he
was
drifting
amid
life
like
the
barren
*NL*
shell
of
the
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Art
thou
pale
for
weariness
*NL*
Of
climbing
heaven
and
gazing
on
the
earth
,
*NL*
Wandering
companionless
...
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
to
himself
the
lines
of
Shelley
's
fragment
.
Its
alternation
*NL*
of
sad
human
ineffectiveness
with
vast
inhuman
cycles
of
activity
*NL*
chilled
him
and
he
forgot
his
own
human
and
ineffectual
grieving
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
's
mother
and
his
brother
and
one
of
his
cousins
waited
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
quiet
Foster
Place
while
he
and
his
father
went
up
the
steps
*NL*
and
along
the
colonnade
where
the
Highland
sentry
was
parading
.
When
*NL*
they
had
passed
into
the
great
hall
and
stood
at
the
counter
Stephen
*NL*
drew
forth
his
orders
on
the
governor
of
the
bank
of
Ireland
for
thirty
*NL*
and
three
pounds
;
and
these
sums
,
the
moneys
of
his
exhibition
and
*NL*
essay
prize
,
were
paid
over
to
him
rapidly
by
the
teller
in
notes
and
*NL*
in
coin
respectively
.
He
bestowed
them
in
his
pockets
with
feigned
*NL*
composure
and
suffered
the
friendly
teller
,
to
whom
his
father
chatted
,
*NL*
to
take
his
hand
across
the
broad
counter
and
wish
him
a
brilliant
*NL*
career
in
after
life
.
He
was
impatient
of
their
voices
and
could
not
*NL*
keep
his
feet
at
rest
.
But
the
teller
still
deferred
the
serving
of
*NL*
others
to
say
he
was
living
in
changed
times
and
that
there
was
nothing
*NL*
like
giving
a
boy
the
best
education
that
money
could
buy
.
Mr
Dedalus
*NL*
lingered
in
the
hall
gazing
about
him
and
up
at
the
roof
and
telling
*NL*
Stephen
,
who
urged
him
to
come
out
,
that
they
were
standing
in
the
*NL*
house
of
commons
of
the
old
Irish
parliament
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
help
us
!
he
said
piously
,
to
think
of
the
men
of
those
times
,
*NL*
Stephen
,
Hely
Hutchinson
and
Flood
and
Henry
Grattan
and
Charles
Kendal
*NL*
Bushe
,
and
the
noblemen
we
have
now
,
leaders
of
the
Irish
people
at
*NL*
home
and
abroad
.
Why
,
by
God
,
they
would
n't
be
seen
dead
in
a
ten-acre
*NL*
field
with
them
.
No
,
Stephen
,
old
chap
,
I
'm
sorry
to
say
that
they
are
*NL*
only
as
I
roved
out
one
fine
May
morning
in
the
merry
month
of
sweet
*NL*
July
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
keen
October
wind
was
blowing
round
the
bank
.
The
three
figures
*NL*
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
muddy
path
had
pinched
cheeks
and
watery
*NL*
eyes
.
Stephen
looked
at
his
thinly
clad
mother
and
remembered
that
a
*NL*
few
days
before
he
had
seen
a
mantle
priced
at
twenty
guineas
in
the
*NL*
windows
of
Barnardo
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
that
's
done
,
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
had
better
go
to
dinner
,
said
Stephen
.
Where
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dinner
?
said
Mr
Dedalus
.
Well
,
I
suppose
we
had
better
,
what
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Some
place
that
's
not
too
dear
,
said
Mrs
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Underdone
's
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
.
Some
quiet
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
along
,
said
Stephen
quickly
.
It
does
n't
matter
about
the
*NL*
dearness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
before
them
with
short
nervous
steps
,
smiling
.
They
tried
*NL*
to
keep
up
with
him
,
smiling
also
at
his
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Take
it
easy
like
a
good
young
fellow
,
said
his
father
.
We
're
not
*NL*
out
for
the
half
mile
,
are
we
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
swift
season
of
merrymaking
the
money
of
his
prizes
ran
through
*NL*
Stephen
's
fingers
.
Great
parcels
of
groceries
and
delicacies
and
dried
*NL*
fruits
arrived
from
the
city
.
Every
day
he
drew
up
a
bill
of
fare
for
*NL*
the
family
and
every
night
led
a
party
of
three
or
four
to
the
theatre
*NL*
to
see
INGOMAR
or
THE
LADY
OF
LYONS
.
In
his
coat
pockets
he
carried
*NL*
squares
of
Vienna
chocolate
for
his
guests
while
his
trousers
'
pocket
*NL*
bulged
with
masses
of
silver
and
copper
coins
.
He
bought
presents
for
*NL*
everyone
,
overhauled
his
room
,
wrote
out
resolutions
,
marshalled
his
*NL*
books
up
and
down
their
shelves
,
pored
upon
all
kinds
of
price
lists
,
*NL*
drew
up
a
form
of
commonwealth
for
the
household
by
which
every
member
*NL*
of
it
held
some
office
,
opened
a
loan
bank
for
his
family
and
pressed
*NL*
loans
on
willing
borrowers
so
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
making
*NL*
out
receipts
and
reckoning
the
interests
on
the
sums
lent
.
When
he
*NL*
could
do
no
more
he
drove
up
and
down
the
city
in
trams
.
Then
the
*NL*
season
of
pleasure
came
to
an
end
.
The
pot
of
pink
enamel
paint
gave
out
*NL*
and
the
wainscot
of
his
bedroom
remained
with
its
unfinished
and
*NL*
ill-plastered
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
household
returned
to
its
usual
way
of
life
.
His
mother
had
no
*NL*
further
occasion
to
upbraid
him
for
squandering
his
money
.
He
too
*NL*
returned
to
his
old
life
at
school
and
all
his
novel
enterprises
fell
*NL*
to
pieces
.
The
commonwealth
fell
,
the
loan
bank
closed
its
coffers
and
*NL*
its
books
on
a
sensible
loss
,
the
rules
of
life
which
he
had
drawn
*NL*
about
himself
fell
into
desuetude
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
foolish
his
aim
had
been
!
He
had
tried
to
build
a
break-water
of
*NL*
order
and
elegance
against
the
sordid
tide
of
life
without
him
and
to
*NL*
dam
up
,
by
rules
of
conduct
and
active
interest
and
new
filial
*NL*
relations
,
the
powerful
recurrence
of
the
tides
within
him
.
Useless
.
*NL*
From
without
as
from
within
the
waters
had
flowed
over
his
barriers
:
*NL*
their
tides
began
once
more
to
jostle
fiercely
above
the
crumbled
mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
clearly
too
his
own
futile
isolation
.
He
had
not
gone
one
step
*NL*
nearer
the
lives
he
had
sought
to
approach
nor
bridged
the
restless
*NL*
shame
and
rancour
that
had
divided
him
from
mother
and
brother
and
*NL*
sister
.
He
felt
that
he
was
hardly
of
the
one
blood
with
them
but
stood
*NL*
to
them
rather
in
the
mystical
kinship
of
fosterage
,
fosterchild
and
*NL*
fosterbrother
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
appease
the
fierce
longings
of
his
heart
before
which
*NL*
everything
else
was
idle
and
alien
.
He
cared
little
that
he
was
in
*NL*
mortal
sin
,
that
his
life
had
grown
to
be
a
tissue
of
subterfuge
and
*NL*
falsehood
.
Beside
the
savage
desire
within
him
to
realize
the
*NL*
enormities
which
he
brooded
on
nothing
was
sacred
.
He
bore
cynically
*NL*
with
the
shameful
details
of
his
secret
riots
in
which
he
exulted
to
*NL*
defile
with
patience
whatever
image
had
attracted
his
eyes
.
By
day
and
*NL*
by
night
he
moved
among
distorted
images
of
the
outer
world
.
A
figure
*NL*
that
had
seemed
to
him
by
day
demure
and
innocent
came
towards
him
by
*NL*
night
through
the
winding
darkness
of
sleep
,
her
face
transfigured
by
a
*NL*
lecherous
cunning
,
her
eyes
bright
with
brutish
joy
.
Only
the
morning
*NL*
pained
him
with
its
dim
memory
of
dark
orgiastic
riot
,
its
keen
and
*NL*
humiliating
sense
of
transgression
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
his
wanderings
.
The
veiled
autumnal
evenings
led
him
*NL*
from
street
to
street
as
they
had
led
him
years
before
along
the
quiet
*NL*
avenues
of
Blackrock
.
But
no
vision
of
trim
front
gardens
or
of
kindly
*NL*
lights
in
the
windows
poured
a
tender
influence
upon
him
now
.
Only
at
*NL*
times
,
in
the
pauses
of
his
desire
,
when
the
luxury
that
was
wasting
*NL*
him
gave
room
to
a
softer
languor
,
the
image
of
Mercedes
traversed
the
*NL*
background
of
his
memory
.
He
saw
again
the
small
white
house
and
the
*NL*
garden
of
rose-bushes
on
the
road
that
led
to
the
mountains
and
he
*NL*
remembered
the
sadly
proud
gesture
of
refusal
which
he
was
to
make
*NL*
there
,
standing
with
her
in
the
moonlit
garden
after
years
of
*NL*
estrangement
and
adventure
.
At
those
moments
the
soft
speeches
of
*NL*
Claude
Melnotte
rose
to
his
lips
and
eased
his
unrest
.
A
tender
*NL*
premonition
touched
him
of
the
tryst
he
had
then
looked
forward
to
and
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
horrible
reality
which
lay
between
his
hope
of
then
and
*NL*
now
,
of
the
holy
encounter
he
had
then
imagined
at
which
weakness
and
*NL*
timidity
and
inexperience
were
to
fall
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
moments
passed
and
the
wasting
fires
of
lust
sprang
up
again
.
The
*NL*
verses
passed
from
his
lips
and
the
inarticulate
cries
and
the
unspoken
*NL*
brutal
words
rushed
forth
from
his
brain
to
force
a
passage
.
His
blood
*NL*
was
in
revolt
.
He
wandered
up
and
down
the
dark
slimy
streets
peering
*NL*
into
the
gloom
of
lanes
and
doorways
,
listening
eagerly
for
any
sound
.
*NL*
He
moaned
to
himself
like
some
baffled
prowling
beast
.
He
wanted
to
sin
*NL*
with
another
of
his
kind
,
to
force
another
being
to
sin
with
him
and
to
*NL*
exult
with
her
in
sin
.
He
felt
some
dark
presence
moving
irresistibly
*NL*
upon
him
from
the
darkness
,
a
presence
subtle
and
murmurous
as
a
flood
*NL*
filling
him
wholly
with
itself
.
Its
murmur
besieged
his
ears
like
the
*NL*
murmur
of
some
multitude
in
sleep
;
its
subtle
streams
penetrated
his
*NL*
being
.
His
hands
clenched
convulsively
and
his
teeth
set
together
as
he
*NL*
suffered
the
agony
of
its
penetration
.
He
stretched
out
his
arms
in
the
*NL*
street
to
hold
fast
the
frail
swooning
form
that
eluded
him
and
incited
*NL*
him
:
and
the
cry
that
he
had
strangled
for
so
long
in
his
throat
issued
*NL*
from
his
lips
.
It
broke
from
him
like
a
wail
of
despair
from
a
hell
of
*NL*
sufferers
and
died
in
a
wail
of
furious
entreaty
,
a
cry
for
an
*NL*
iniquitous
abandonment
,
a
cry
which
was
but
the
echo
of
an
obscene
*NL*
scrawl
which
he
had
read
on
the
oozing
wall
of
a
urinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
wandered
into
a
maze
of
narrow
and
dirty
streets
.
From
the
foul
*NL*
laneways
he
heard
bursts
of
hoarse
riot
and
wrangling
and
the
drawling
*NL*
of
drunken
singers
.
He
walked
onward
,
dismayed
,
wondering
whether
he
*NL*
had
strayed
into
the
quarter
of
the
Jews
.
Women
and
girls
dressed
in
*NL*
long
vivid
gowns
traversed
the
street
from
house
to
house
.
They
were
*NL*
leisurely
and
perfumed
.
A
trembling
seized
him
and
his
eyes
grew
dim
.
*NL*
The
yellow
gas-flames
arose
before
his
troubled
vision
against
the
*NL*
vapoury
sky
,
burning
as
if
before
an
altar
.
Before
the
doors
and
in
the
*NL*
lighted
halls
groups
were
gathered
arrayed
as
for
some
rite
.
He
was
in
*NL*
another
world
:
he
had
awakened
from
a
slumber
of
centuries
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
roadway
,
his
heart
clamouring
*NL*
against
his
bosom
in
a
tumult
.
A
young
woman
dressed
in
a
long
pink
*NL*
gown
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
to
detain
him
and
gazed
into
his
face
.
*NL*
She
said
gaily
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
night
,
Willie
dear
!
*NL*
*NL*
Her
room
was
warm
and
lightsome
.
A
huge
doll
sat
with
her
legs
apart
in
*NL*
the
copious
easy-chair
beside
the
bed
.
He
tried
to
bid
his
tongue
speak
*NL*
that
he
might
seem
at
ease
,
watching
her
as
she
undid
her
gown
,
noting
*NL*
the
proud
conscious
movements
of
her
perfumed
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
stood
silent
in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
came
over
to
him
and
*NL*
embraced
him
gaily
and
gravely
.
Her
round
arms
held
him
firmly
to
her
*NL*
and
he
,
seeing
her
face
lifted
to
him
in
serious
calm
and
feeling
the
*NL*
warm
calm
rise
and
fall
of
her
breast
,
all
but
burst
into
hysterical
*NL*
weeping
.
Tears
of
joy
and
relief
shone
in
his
delighted
eyes
and
his
*NL*
lips
parted
though
they
would
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
her
tinkling
hand
through
his
hair
,
calling
him
a
little
*NL*
rascal
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Give
me
a
kiss
,
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
lips
would
not
bend
to
kiss
her
.
He
wanted
to
be
held
firmly
in
her
*NL*
arms
,
to
be
caressed
slowly
,
slowly
,
slowly
.
In
her
arms
he
felt
that
*NL*
he
had
suddenly
become
strong
and
fearless
and
sure
of
himself
.
But
his
*NL*
lips
would
not
bend
to
kiss
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
sudden
movement
she
bowed
his
head
and
joined
her
lips
to
his
*NL*
and
he
read
the
meaning
of
her
movements
in
her
frank
uplifted
eyes
.
It
*NL*
was
too
much
for
him
.
He
closed
his
eyes
,
surrendering
himself
to
her
,
*NL*
body
and
mind
,
conscious
of
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
dark
pressure
*NL*
of
her
softly
parting
lips
.
They
pressed
upon
his
brain
as
upon
his
*NL*
lips
as
though
they
were
the
vehicle
of
a
vague
speech
;
and
between
*NL*
them
he
felt
an
unknown
and
timid
pressure
,
darker
than
the
swoon
of
*NL*
sin
,
softer
than
sound
or
odour
.

Chapter
3
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
swift
December
dusk
had
come
tumbling
clownishly
after
its
dull
day
*NL*
and
,
as
he
stared
through
the
dull
square
of
the
window
of
the
*NL*
schoolroom
,
he
felt
his
belly
crave
for
its
food
.
He
hoped
there
would
*NL*
be
stew
for
dinner
,
turnips
and
carrots
and
bruised
potatoes
and
fat
*NL*
mutton
pieces
to
be
ladled
out
in
thick
peppered
flour-fattened
sauce
.
*NL*
Stuff
it
into
you
,
his
belly
counselled
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
a
gloomy
secret
night
.
After
early
nightfall
the
yellow
*NL*
lamps
would
light
up
,
here
and
there
,
the
squalid
quarter
of
the
*NL*
brothels
.
He
would
follow
a
devious
course
up
and
down
the
streets
,
*NL*
circling
always
nearer
and
nearer
in
a
tremor
of
fear
and
joy
,
until
*NL*
his
feet
led
him
suddenly
round
a
dark
corner
.
The
whores
would
be
just
*NL*
coming
out
of
their
houses
making
ready
for
the
night
,
yawning
lazily
*NL*
after
their
sleep
and
settling
the
hairpins
in
their
clusters
of
hair
.
*NL*
He
would
pass
by
them
calmly
waiting
for
a
sudden
movement
of
his
own
*NL*
will
or
a
sudden
call
to
his
sin-loving
soul
from
their
soft
perfumed
*NL*
flesh
.
Yet
as
he
prowled
in
quest
of
that
call
,
his
senses
,
stultified
*NL*
only
by
his
desire
,
would
note
keenly
all
that
wounded
or
shamed
them
;
*NL*
his
eyes
,
a
ring
of
porter
froth
on
a
clothless
table
or
a
photograph
*NL*
of
two
soldiers
standing
to
attention
or
a
gaudy
playbill
;
his
ears
,
*NL*
the
drawling
jargon
of
greeting
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hello
,
Bertie
,
any
good
in
your
mind
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
that
you
,
pigeon
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Number
ten
.
Fresh
Nelly
is
waiting
on
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
night
,
husband
!
Coming
in
to
have
a
short
time
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
equation
on
the
page
of
his
scribbler
began
to
spread
out
a
*NL*
widening
tail
,
eyed
and
starred
like
a
peacock
's
;
and
,
when
the
eyes
*NL*
and
stars
of
its
indices
had
been
eliminated
,
began
slowly
to
fold
*NL*
itself
together
again
.
The
indices
appearing
and
disappearing
were
eyes
*NL*
opening
and
closing
;
the
eyes
opening
and
closing
were
stars
being
born
*NL*
and
being
quenched
.
The
vast
cycle
of
starry
life
bore
his
weary
mind
*NL*
outward
to
its
verge
and
inward
to
its
centre
,
a
distant
music
*NL*
accompanying
him
outward
and
inward
.
What
music
?
The
music
came
nearer
*NL*
and
he
recalled
the
words
,
the
words
of
Shelley
's
fragment
upon
the
*NL*
moon
wandering
companionless
,
pale
for
weariness
.
The
stars
began
to
*NL*
crumble
and
a
cloud
of
fine
stardust
fell
through
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dull
light
fell
more
faintly
upon
the
page
whereon
another
equation
*NL*
began
to
unfold
itself
slowly
and
to
spread
abroad
its
widening
tail
.
*NL*
It
was
his
own
soul
going
forth
to
experience
,
unfolding
itself
sin
by
*NL*
sin
,
spreading
abroad
the
bale-fire
of
its
burning
stars
and
folding
*NL*
back
upon
itself
,
fading
slowly
,
quenching
its
own
lights
and
fires
.
*NL*
They
were
quenched
:
and
the
cold
darkness
filled
chaos
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cold
lucid
indifference
reigned
in
his
soul
.
At
his
first
violent
sin
*NL*
he
had
felt
a
wave
of
vitality
pass
out
of
him
and
had
feared
to
find
*NL*
his
body
or
his
soul
maimed
by
the
excess
.
Instead
the
vital
wave
had
*NL*
carried
him
on
its
bosom
out
of
himself
and
back
again
when
it
receded
:
*NL*
and
no
part
of
body
or
soul
had
been
maimed
but
a
dark
peace
had
been
*NL*
established
between
them
.
The
chaos
in
which
his
ardour
extinguished
*NL*
itself
was
a
cold
indifferent
knowledge
of
himself
.
He
had
sinned
*NL*
mortally
not
once
but
many
times
and
he
knew
that
,
while
he
stood
in
*NL*
danger
of
eternal
damnation
for
the
first
sin
alone
,
by
every
*NL*
succeeding
sin
he
multiplied
his
guilt
and
his
punishment
.
His
days
and
*NL*
works
and
thoughts
could
make
no
atonement
for
him
,
the
fountains
of
*NL*
sanctifying
grace
having
ceased
to
refresh
his
soul
.
At
most
,
by
an
*NL*
alms
given
to
a
beggar
whose
blessing
he
fled
from
,
he
might
hope
*NL*
wearily
to
win
for
himself
some
measure
of
actual
grace
.
Devotion
had
*NL*
gone
by
the
board
.
What
did
it
avail
to
pray
when
he
knew
that
his
soul
*NL*
lusted
after
its
own
destruction
?
A
certain
pride
,
a
certain
awe
,
*NL*
withheld
him
from
offering
to
God
even
one
prayer
at
night
,
though
he
*NL*
knew
it
was
in
God
's
power
to
take
away
his
life
while
he
slept
and
*NL*
hurl
his
soul
hellward
ere
he
could
beg
for
mercy
.
His
pride
in
his
own
*NL*
sin
,
his
loveless
awe
of
God
,
told
him
that
his
offence
was
too
*NL*
grievous
to
be
atoned
for
in
whole
or
in
part
by
a
false
homage
to
the
*NL*
All-seeing
and
All-knowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
now
,
Ennis
,
I
declare
you
have
a
head
and
so
has
my
stick
!
Do
*NL*
you
mean
to
say
that
you
are
not
able
to
tell
me
what
a
surd
is
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
blundering
answer
stirred
the
embers
of
his
contempt
of
his
*NL*
fellows
.
Towards
others
he
felt
neither
shame
nor
fear
.
On
Sunday
*NL*
mornings
as
he
passed
the
church
door
he
glanced
coldly
at
the
*NL*
worshippers
who
stood
bareheaded
,
four
deep
,
outside
the
church
,
*NL*
morally
present
at
the
mass
which
they
could
neither
see
nor
hear
.
*NL*
Their
dull
piety
and
the
sickly
smell
of
the
cheap
hair-oil
with
which
*NL*
they
had
anointed
their
heads
repelled
him
from
the
altar
they
prayed
*NL*
at
.
He
stooped
to
the
evil
of
hypocrisy
with
others
,
sceptical
of
their
*NL*
innocence
which
he
could
cajole
so
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
wall
of
his
bedroom
hung
an
illuminated
scroll
,
the
certificate
*NL*
of
his
prefecture
in
the
college
of
the
sodality
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
*NL*
Mary
.
On
Saturday
mornings
when
the
sodality
met
in
the
chapel
to
*NL*
recite
the
little
office
his
place
was
a
cushioned
kneeling-desk
at
the
*NL*
right
of
the
altar
from
which
he
led
his
wing
of
boys
through
the
*NL*
responses
.
The
falsehood
of
his
position
did
not
pain
him
.
If
at
*NL*
moments
he
felt
an
impulse
to
rise
from
his
post
of
honour
and
,
*NL*
confessing
before
them
all
his
unworthiness
,
to
leave
the
chapel
,
a
*NL*
glance
at
their
faces
restrained
him
.
The
imagery
of
the
psalms
of
*NL*
prophecy
soothed
his
barren
pride
.
The
glories
of
Mary
held
his
soul
*NL*
captive
:
spikenard
and
myrrh
and
frankincense
,
symbolizing
her
royal
*NL*
lineage
,
her
emblems
,
the
late-flowering
plant
and
late-blossoming
*NL*
tree
,
symbolizing
the
age-long
gradual
growth
of
her
cultus
among
men
.
*NL*
When
it
fell
to
him
to
read
the
lesson
towards
the
close
of
the
office
*NL*
he
read
it
in
a
veiled
voice
,
lulling
his
conscience
to
its
music
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
sin
,
which
had
covered
him
from
the
sight
of
God
,
had
led
him
*NL*
nearer
to
the
refuge
of
sinners
.
Her
eyes
seemed
to
regard
him
with
*NL*
mild
pity
;
her
holiness
,
a
strange
light
glowing
faintly
upon
her
frail
*NL*
flesh
,
did
not
humiliate
the
sinner
who
approached
her
.
If
ever
he
was
*NL*
impelled
to
cast
sin
from
him
and
to
repent
the
impulse
that
moved
him
*NL*
was
the
wish
to
be
her
knight
.
If
ever
his
soul
,
re-entering
her
*NL*
dwelling
shyly
after
the
frenzy
of
his
body
's
lust
had
spent
itself
,
*NL*
was
turned
towards
her
whose
emblem
is
the
morning
star
,
BRIGHT
AND
*NL*
MUSICAL
,
TELLING
OF
HEAVEN
AND
INFUSING
PEACE
,
it
was
when
her
names
*NL*
were
murmured
softly
by
lips
whereon
there
still
lingered
foul
and
*NL*
shameful
words
,
the
savour
itself
of
a
lewd
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
strange
.
He
tried
to
think
how
it
could
be
.
But
the
dusk
,
*NL*
deepening
in
the
schoolroom
,
covered
over
his
thoughts
.
The
bell
rang
.
*NL*
The
master
marked
the
sums
and
cuts
to
be
done
for
the
next
lesson
and
*NL*
went
out
.
Heron
,
beside
Stephen
,
began
to
hum
tunelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MY
EXCELLENT
FRIEND
BOMBADOS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ennis
,
who
had
gone
to
the
yard
,
came
back
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
boy
from
the
house
is
coming
up
for
the
rector
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tall
boy
behind
Stephen
rubbed
his
hands
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
game
ball
.
We
can
scut
the
whole
hour
.
He
wo
n't
be
in
till
*NL*
after
half
two
.
Then
you
can
ask
him
questions
on
the
catechism
,
*NL*
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
leaning
back
and
drawing
idly
on
his
scribbler
,
listened
to
*NL*
the
talk
about
him
which
Heron
checked
from
time
to
time
by
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Shut
up
,
will
you
.
Do
n't
make
such
a
bally
racket
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
strange
too
that
he
found
an
arid
pleasure
in
following
up
to
*NL*
the
end
the
rigid
lines
of
the
doctrines
of
the
church
and
penetrating
*NL*
into
obscure
silences
only
to
hear
and
feel
the
more
deeply
his
own
*NL*
condemnation
.
The
sentence
of
saint
James
which
says
that
he
who
*NL*
offends
against
one
commandment
becomes
guilty
of
all
,
had
seemed
to
him
*NL*
first
a
swollen
phrase
until
he
had
begun
to
grope
in
the
darkness
*NL*
of
his
own
state
.
From
the
evil
seed
of
lust
all
other
deadly
*NL*
sins
had
sprung
forth
:
pride
in
himself
and
contempt
of
others
,
*NL*
covetousness
in
using
money
for
the
purchase
of
unlawful
pleasures
,
*NL*
envy
of
those
whose
vices
he
could
not
reach
to
and
calumnious
*NL*
murmuring
against
the
pious
,
gluttonous
enjoyment
of
food
,
*NL*
the
dull
glowering
anger
amid
which
he
brooded
upon
his
longing
,
the
*NL*
swamp
of
spiritual
and
bodily
sloth
in
which
his
whole
being
had
sunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
sat
in
his
bench
gazing
calmly
at
the
rector
's
shrewd
harsh
face
,
*NL*
his
mind
wound
itself
in
and
out
of
the
curious
questions
proposed
to
*NL*
it
.
If
a
man
had
stolen
a
pound
in
his
youth
and
had
used
that
pound
to
*NL*
amass
a
huge
fortune
how
much
was
he
obliged
to
give
back
,
the
pound
he
*NL*
had
stolen
only
or
the
pound
together
with
the
compound
interest
*NL*
accruing
upon
it
or
all
his
huge
fortune
?
If
a
layman
in
giving
baptism
*NL*
pour
the
water
before
saying
the
words
is
the
child
baptized
?
Is
*NL*
baptism
with
a
mineral
water
valid
?
How
comes
it
that
while
the
first
*NL*
beatitude
promises
the
kingdom
of
heaven
to
the
poor
of
heart
the
*NL*
second
beatitude
promises
also
to
the
meek
that
they
shall
possess
the
*NL*
land
?
Why
was
the
sacrament
of
the
eucharist
instituted
under
the
two
*NL*
species
of
bread
and
wine
if
Jesus
Christ
be
present
body
and
blood
,
*NL*
soul
and
divinity
,
in
the
bread
alone
and
in
the
wine
alone
?
Does
a
*NL*
tiny
particle
of
the
consecrated
bread
contain
all
the
body
and
blood
*NL*
of
Jesus
Christ
or
a
part
only
of
the
body
and
blood
?
If
the
wine
*NL*
change
into
vinegar
and
the
host
crumble
into
corruption
after
they
*NL*
have
been
consecrated
,
is
Jesus
Christ
still
present
under
their
*NL*
species
as
God
and
as
man
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
he
is
!
Here
he
is
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
boy
from
his
post
at
the
window
had
seen
the
rector
come
from
the
*NL*
house
.
All
the
catechisms
were
opened
and
all
heads
bent
upon
them
*NL*
silently
.
The
rector
entered
and
took
his
seat
on
the
dais
.
A
gentle
*NL*
kick
from
the
tall
boy
in
the
bench
behind
urged
Stephen
to
ask
a
*NL*
difficult
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rector
did
not
ask
for
a
catechism
to
hear
the
lesson
from
.
He
*NL*
clasped
his
hands
on
the
desk
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
retreat
will
begin
on
Wednesday
afternoon
in
honour
of
saint
*NL*
Francis
Xavier
whose
feast
day
is
Saturday
.
The
retreat
will
go
on
from
*NL*
Wednesday
to
Friday
.
On
Friday
confession
will
be
heard
all
the
*NL*
afternoon
after
beads
.
If
any
boys
have
special
confessors
perhaps
it
*NL*
will
be
better
for
them
not
to
change
.
Mass
will
be
on
Saturday
morning
*NL*
at
nine
o'clock
and
general
communion
for
the
whole
college
.
Saturday
*NL*
will
be
a
free
day
.
But
Saturday
and
Sunday
being
free
days
some
boys
*NL*
might
be
inclined
to
think
that
Monday
is
a
free
day
also
.
Beware
of
*NL*
making
that
mistake
.
I
think
you
,
Lawless
,
are
likely
to
make
that
*NL*
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
sir
?
Why
,
sir
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
wave
of
quiet
mirth
broke
forth
over
the
class
of
boys
from
*NL*
the
rector
's
grim
smile
.
Stephen
's
heart
began
slowly
to
fold
and
fade
*NL*
with
fear
like
a
withering
flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rector
went
on
gravely
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
are
all
familiar
with
the
story
of
the
life
of
saint
Francis
*NL*
Xavier
,
I
suppose
,
the
patron
of
your
college
.
He
came
of
an
old
and
*NL*
illustrious
Spanish
family
and
you
remember
that
he
was
one
of
the
*NL*
first
followers
of
saint
Ignatius
.
They
met
in
Paris
where
Francis
*NL*
Xavier
was
professor
of
philosophy
at
the
university
.
This
young
and
*NL*
brilliant
nobleman
and
man
of
letters
entered
heart
and
soul
into
the
*NL*
ideas
of
our
glorious
founder
and
you
know
that
he
,
at
his
own
desire
,
*NL*
was
sent
by
saint
Ignatius
to
preach
to
the
Indians
.
He
is
called
,
as
*NL*
you
know
,
the
apostle
of
the
Indies
.
He
went
from
country
to
country
in
*NL*
the
east
,
from
Africa
to
India
,
from
India
to
Japan
,
baptizing
the
*NL*
people
.
He
is
said
to
have
baptized
as
many
as
ten
thousand
idolaters
*NL*
in
one
month
.
It
is
said
that
his
right
arm
had
grown
powerless
from
*NL*
having
been
raised
so
often
over
the
heads
of
those
whom
he
baptized
.
*NL*
He
wished
then
to
go
to
China
to
win
still
more
souls
for
God
but
he
*NL*
died
of
fever
on
the
island
of
Sancian
.
A
great
saint
,
saint
Francis
*NL*
Xavier
!
A
great
soldier
of
God
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
rector
paused
and
then
,
shaking
his
clasped
hands
before
him
,
went
*NL*
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
had
the
faith
in
him
that
moves
mountains
.
Ten
thousand
souls
won
*NL*
for
God
in
a
single
month
!
That
is
a
true
conqueror
,
true
to
the
motto
*NL*
of
our
order
:
AD
MAJOREM
DEI
GLORIAM
!
A
saint
who
has
great
power
in
*NL*
heaven
,
remember
:
power
to
intercede
for
us
in
our
grief
;
power
to
*NL*
obtain
whatever
we
pray
for
if
it
be
for
the
good
of
our
souls
;
power
*NL*
above
all
to
obtain
for
us
the
grace
to
repent
if
we
be
in
sin
.
A
great
*NL*
saint
,
saint
Francis
Xavier
!
A
great
fisher
of
souls
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
ceased
to
shake
his
clasped
hands
and
,
resting
them
against
his
*NL*
forehead
,
looked
right
and
left
of
them
keenly
at
his
listeners
out
of
*NL*
his
dark
stern
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
silence
their
dark
fire
kindled
the
dusk
into
a
tawny
glow
.
*NL*
Stephen
's
heart
had
withered
up
like
a
flower
of
the
desert
that
feels
*NL*
the
simoom
coming
from
afar
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
--
REMEMBER
ONLY
THY
LAST
THINGS
AND
THOU
SHALT
NOT
SIN
FOR
EVER
--
words
*NL*
taken
,
my
dear
little
brothers
in
Christ
,
from
the
book
of
*NL*
Ecclesiastes
,
seventh
chapter
,
fortieth
verse
.
In
the
name
of
the
*NL*
Father
and
of
the
Son
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost
.
Amen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
sat
in
the
front
bench
of
the
chapel
.
Father
Arnall
sat
at
a
*NL*
table
to
the
left
of
the
altar
.
He
wore
about
his
shoulders
a
heavy
*NL*
cloak
;
his
pale
face
was
drawn
and
his
voice
broken
with
rheum
.
The
*NL*
figure
of
his
old
master
,
so
strangely
re-arisen
,
brought
back
to
*NL*
Stephen
's
mind
his
life
at
Clongowes
:
the
wide
playgrounds
,
swarming
*NL*
with
boys
;
the
square
ditch
;
the
little
cemetery
off
the
main
avenue
of
*NL*
limes
where
he
had
dreamed
of
being
buried
;
the
firelight
on
the
wall
*NL*
of
the
infirmary
where
he
lay
sick
;
the
sorrowful
face
of
Brother
*NL*
Michael
.
His
soul
,
as
these
memories
came
back
to
him
,
became
again
a
*NL*
child
's
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
are
assembled
here
today
,
my
dear
little
brothers
in
Christ
,
for
*NL*
one
brief
moment
far
away
from
the
busy
bustle
of
the
outer
world
to
*NL*
celebrate
and
to
honour
one
of
the
greatest
of
saints
,
the
apostle
of
*NL*
the
Indies
,
the
patron
saint
also
of
your
college
,
saint
Francis
*NL*
Xavier
.
Year
after
year
,
for
much
longer
than
any
of
you
,
my
dear
*NL*
little
boys
,
can
remember
or
than
I
can
remember
,
the
boys
of
this
*NL*
college
have
met
in
this
very
chapel
to
make
their
annual
retreat
*NL*
before
the
feast
day
of
their
patron
saint
.
Time
has
gone
on
and
*NL*
brought
with
it
its
changes
.
Even
in
the
last
few
years
what
changes
*NL*
can
most
of
you
not
remember
?
Many
of
the
boys
who
sat
in
those
front
*NL*
benches
a
few
years
ago
are
perhaps
now
in
distant
lands
,
in
the
*NL*
burning
tropics
,
or
immersed
in
professional
duties
or
in
seminaries
,
*NL*
or
voyaging
over
the
vast
expanse
of
the
deep
or
,
it
may
be
,
already
*NL*
called
by
the
great
God
to
another
life
and
to
the
rendering
up
of
*NL*
their
stewardship
.
And
still
as
the
years
roll
by
,
bringing
with
them
*NL*
changes
for
good
and
bad
,
the
memory
of
the
great
saint
is
honoured
by
*NL*
the
boys
of
this
college
who
make
every
year
their
annual
retreat
on
*NL*
the
days
preceding
the
feast
day
set
apart
by
our
Holy
Mother
the
*NL*
Church
to
transmit
to
all
the
ages
the
name
and
fame
of
one
of
the
*NL*
greatest
sons
of
catholic
Spain
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
word
RETREAT
and
why
is
it
allowed
*NL*
on
all
hands
to
be
a
most
salutary
practice
for
all
who
desire
to
lead
*NL*
before
God
and
in
the
eyes
of
men
a
truly
christian
life
?
A
retreat
,
my
*NL*
dear
boys
,
signifies
a
withdrawal
for
awhile
from
the
cares
of
our
*NL*
life
,
the
cares
of
this
workaday
world
,
in
order
to
examine
the
state
*NL*
of
our
conscience
,
to
reflect
on
the
mysteries
of
holy
religion
and
to
*NL*
understand
better
why
we
are
here
in
this
world
.
During
these
few
days
*NL*
I
intend
to
put
before
you
some
thoughts
concerning
the
four
last
*NL*
things
.
They
are
,
as
you
know
from
your
catechism
,
death
,
judgement
,
*NL*
hell
,
and
heaven
.
We
shall
try
to
understand
them
fully
during
these
*NL*
few
days
so
that
we
may
derive
from
the
understanding
of
them
a
lasting
*NL*
benefit
to
our
souls
.
And
remember
,
my
dear
boys
,
that
we
have
been
*NL*
sent
into
this
world
for
one
thing
and
for
one
thing
alone
:
to
do
God
's
*NL*
holy
will
and
to
save
our
immortal
souls
.
All
else
is
worthless
.
One
*NL*
thing
alone
is
needful
,
the
salvation
of
one
's
soul
.
What
doth
it
*NL*
profit
a
man
to
gain
the
whole
world
if
he
suffer
the
loss
of
his
*NL*
immortal
soul
?
Ah
,
my
dear
boys
,
believe
me
there
is
nothing
in
this
*NL*
wretched
world
that
can
make
up
for
such
a
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
will
ask
you
,
therefore
,
my
dear
boys
,
to
put
away
from
your
minds
*NL*
during
these
few
days
all
worldly
thoughts
,
whether
of
study
or
*NL*
pleasure
or
ambition
,
and
to
give
all
your
attention
to
the
state
of
*NL*
your
souls
.
I
need
hardly
remind
you
that
during
the
days
of
the
*NL*
retreat
all
boys
are
expected
to
preserve
a
quiet
and
pious
demeanour
*NL*
and
to
shun
all
loud
unseemly
pleasure
.
The
elder
boys
,
of
course
,
will
*NL*
see
that
this
custom
is
not
infringed
and
I
look
especially
to
the
*NL*
prefects
and
officers
of
the
sodality
of
Our
Blessed
Lady
and
of
the
*NL*
sodality
of
the
holy
angels
to
set
a
good
example
to
their
*NL*
fellow-students
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
us
try
,
therefore
,
to
make
this
retreat
in
honour
of
saint
*NL*
Francis
with
our
whole
heart
and
our
whole
mind
.
God
's
blessing
will
*NL*
then
be
upon
all
your
year
's
studies
.
But
,
above
and
beyond
all
,
let
*NL*
this
retreat
be
one
to
which
you
can
look
back
in
after
years
when
*NL*
maybe
you
are
far
from
this
college
and
among
very
different
*NL*
surroundings
,
to
which
you
can
look
back
with
joy
and
thankfulness
and
*NL*
give
thanks
to
God
for
having
granted
you
this
occasion
of
laying
the
*NL*
first
foundation
of
a
pious
honourable
zealous
christian
life
.
And
if
,
*NL*
as
may
so
happen
,
there
be
at
this
moment
in
these
benches
any
poor
*NL*
soul
who
has
had
the
unutterable
misfortune
to
lose
God
's
holy
grace
*NL*
and
to
fall
into
grievous
sin
,
I
fervently
trust
and
pray
that
this
*NL*
retreat
may
be
the
turning
point
in
the
life
of
that
soul
.
I
pray
to
*NL*
God
through
the
merits
of
His
zealous
servant
Francis
Xavier
,
that
such
*NL*
a
soul
may
be
led
to
sincere
repentance
and
that
the
holy
communion
on
*NL*
saint
Francis
's
day
of
this
year
may
be
a
lasting
covenant
between
God
*NL*
and
that
soul
.
For
just
and
unjust
,
for
saint
and
sinner
alike
,
may
*NL*
this
retreat
be
a
memorable
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Help
me
,
my
dear
little
brothers
in
Christ
.
Help
me
by
your
pious
*NL*
attention
,
by
your
own
devotion
,
by
your
outward
demeanour
.
Banish
from
*NL*
your
minds
all
worldly
thoughts
and
think
only
of
the
last
things
,
*NL*
death
,
judgement
,
hell
,
and
heaven
.
He
who
remembers
these
things
,
says
*NL*
Ecclesiastes
,
shall
not
sin
for
ever
.
He
who
remembers
the
last
things
*NL*
will
act
and
think
with
them
always
before
his
eyes
.
He
will
live
a
*NL*
good
life
and
die
a
good
death
,
believing
and
knowing
that
,
if
he
has
*NL*
sacrificed
much
in
this
earthly
life
,
it
will
be
given
to
him
a
*NL*
hundredfold
and
a
thousandfold
more
in
the
life
to
come
,
in
the
kingdom
*NL*
without
end
--
a
blessing
,
my
dear
boys
,
which
I
wish
you
from
my
heart
,
*NL*
one
and
all
,
in
the
name
of
the
Father
and
of
the
Son
and
of
the
Holy
*NL*
Ghost
.
Amen
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
walked
home
with
silent
companions
,
a
thick
fog
seemed
to
compass
*NL*
his
mind
.
He
waited
in
stupor
of
mind
till
it
should
lift
and
reveal
*NL*
what
it
had
hidden
.
He
ate
his
dinner
with
surly
appetite
and
when
the
*NL*
meal
was
over
and
the
grease-strewn
plates
lay
abandoned
on
the
table
,
*NL*
he
rose
and
went
to
the
window
,
clearing
the
thick
scum
from
his
mouth
*NL*
with
his
tongue
and
licking
it
from
his
lips
.
So
he
had
sunk
to
the
*NL*
state
of
a
beast
that
licks
his
chaps
after
meat
.
This
was
the
end
;
and
*NL*
a
faint
glimmer
of
fear
began
to
pierce
the
fog
of
his
mind
.
He
pressed
*NL*
his
face
against
the
pane
of
the
window
and
gazed
out
into
the
*NL*
darkening
street
.
Forms
passed
this
way
and
that
through
the
dull
*NL*
light
.
And
that
was
life
.
The
letters
of
the
name
of
Dublin
lay
heavily
*NL*
upon
his
mind
,
pushing
one
another
surlily
hither
and
thither
with
slow
*NL*
boorish
insistence
.
His
soul
was
fattening
and
congealing
into
a
gross
*NL*
grease
,
plunging
ever
deeper
in
its
dull
fear
into
a
sombre
threatening
*NL*
dusk
while
the
body
that
was
his
stood
,
listless
and
dishonoured
,
*NL*
gazing
out
of
darkened
eyes
,
helpless
,
perturbed
,
and
human
for
a
*NL*
bovine
god
to
stare
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
brought
death
and
judgement
,
stirring
his
soul
slowly
from
*NL*
its
listless
despair
.
The
faint
glimmer
of
fear
became
a
terror
of
*NL*
spirit
as
the
hoarse
voice
of
the
preacher
blew
death
into
his
soul
.
He
*NL*
suffered
its
agony
.
He
felt
the
death
chill
touch
the
extremities
and
*NL*
creep
onward
towards
the
heart
,
the
film
of
death
veiling
the
eyes
,
the
*NL*
bright
centres
of
the
brain
extinguished
one
by
one
like
lamps
,
the
*NL*
last
sweat
oozing
upon
the
skin
,
the
powerlessness
of
the
dying
limbs
,
*NL*
the
speech
thickening
and
wandering
and
failing
,
the
heart
throbbing
*NL*
faintly
and
more
faintly
,
all
but
vanquished
,
the
breath
,
the
poor
*NL*
breath
,
the
poor
helpless
human
spirit
,
sobbing
and
sighing
,
gurgling
*NL*
and
rattling
in
the
throat
.
No
help
!
No
help
!
He
--
he
himself
--
his
*NL*
body
to
which
he
had
yielded
was
dying
.
Into
the
grave
with
it
.
Nail
it
*NL*
down
into
a
wooden
box
,
the
corpse
.
Carry
it
out
of
the
house
on
the
*NL*
shoulders
of
hirelings
.
Thrust
it
out
of
men
's
sight
into
a
long
hole
*NL*
in
the
ground
,
into
the
grave
,
to
rot
,
to
feed
the
mass
of
its
creeping
*NL*
worms
and
to
be
devoured
by
scuttling
plump-bellied
rats
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
the
friends
were
still
standing
in
tears
by
the
bedside
the
*NL*
soul
of
the
sinner
was
judged
.
At
the
last
moment
of
consciousness
the
*NL*
whole
earthly
life
passed
before
the
vision
of
the
soul
and
,
ere
it
had
*NL*
time
to
reflect
,
the
body
had
died
and
the
soul
stood
terrified
before
*NL*
the
judgement
seat
.
God
,
who
had
long
been
merciful
,
would
then
be
*NL*
just
.
He
had
long
been
patient
,
pleading
with
the
sinful
soul
,
*NL*
giving
it
time
to
repent
,
sparing
it
yet
awhile
.
But
that
time
had
*NL*
gone
.
Time
was
to
sin
and
to
enjoy
,
time
was
to
scoff
at
God
and
at
the
*NL*
warnings
of
His
holy
church
,
time
was
to
defy
His
majesty
,
to
disobey
*NL*
His
commands
,
to
hoodwink
one
's
fellow
men
,
to
commit
sin
after
sin
and
*NL*
to
hide
one
's
corruption
from
the
sight
of
men
.
But
that
time
was
over
.
*NL*
Now
it
was
God
's
turn
:
and
He
was
not
to
be
hoodwinked
or
deceived
.
*NL*
Every
sin
would
then
come
forth
from
its
lurking
place
,
the
most
*NL*
rebellious
against
the
divine
will
and
the
most
degrading
to
our
poor
*NL*
corrupt
nature
,
the
tiniest
imperfection
and
the
most
heinous
atrocity
.
*NL*
What
did
it
avail
then
to
have
been
a
great
emperor
,
a
great
general
,
a
*NL*
marvellous
inventor
,
the
most
learned
of
the
learned
?
All
were
as
one
*NL*
before
the
judgement
seat
of
God
.
He
would
reward
the
good
and
punish
*NL*
the
wicked
.
One
single
instant
was
enough
for
the
trial
of
a
man
's
*NL*
soul
.
One
single
instant
after
the
body
's
death
,
the
soul
had
been
*NL*
weighed
in
the
balance
.
The
particular
judgement
was
over
and
the
soul
*NL*
had
passed
to
the
abode
of
bliss
or
to
the
prison
of
purgatory
or
had
*NL*
been
hurled
howling
into
hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
that
all
.
God
's
justice
had
still
to
be
vindicated
before
men
:
*NL*
after
the
particular
there
still
remained
the
general
judgement
.
The
*NL*
last
day
had
come
.
The
doomsday
was
at
hand
.
The
stars
of
heaven
were
*NL*
falling
upon
the
earth
like
the
figs
cast
by
the
fig-tree
which
the
*NL*
wind
has
shaken
.
The
sun
,
the
great
luminary
of
the
universe
,
had
*NL*
become
as
sackcloth
of
hair
.
The
moon
was
blood-red
.
The
firmament
was
*NL*
as
a
scroll
rolled
away
.
The
archangel
Michael
,
the
prince
of
the
*NL*
heavenly
host
,
appeared
glorious
and
terrible
against
the
sky
.
With
one
*NL*
foot
on
the
sea
and
one
foot
on
the
land
he
blew
from
the
arch-angelical
*NL*
trumpet
the
brazen
death
of
time
.
The
three
blasts
of
the
*NL*
angel
filled
all
the
universe
.
Time
is
,
time
was
,
but
time
shall
be
no
*NL*
more
.
At
the
last
blast
the
souls
of
universal
humanity
throng
towards
*NL*
the
valley
of
Jehoshaphat
,
rich
and
poor
,
gentle
and
simple
,
wise
and
*NL*
foolish
,
good
and
wicked
.
The
soul
of
every
human
being
that
has
ever
*NL*
existed
,
the
souls
of
all
those
who
shall
yet
be
born
,
all
the
sons
and
*NL*
daughters
of
Adam
,
all
are
assembled
on
that
supreme
day
.
And
lo
,
the
*NL*
supreme
judge
is
coming
!
No
longer
the
lowly
Lamb
of
God
,
no
longer
the
*NL*
meek
Jesus
of
Nazareth
,
no
longer
the
Man
of
Sorrows
,
no
longer
the
*NL*
Good
Shepherd
,
He
is
seen
now
coming
upon
the
clouds
,
in
great
power
*NL*
and
majesty
,
attended
by
nine
choirs
of
angels
,
angels
and
archangels
,
*NL*
principalities
,
powers
and
virtues
,
thrones
and
dominations
,
cherubim
*NL*
and
seraphim
,
God
Omnipotent
,
God
Everlasting
.
He
speaks
:
and
His
voice
*NL*
is
heard
even
at
the
farthest
limits
of
space
,
even
in
the
bottomless
*NL*
abyss
.
Supreme
Judge
,
from
His
sentence
there
will
be
and
can
be
no
*NL*
appeal
.
He
calls
the
just
to
His
side
,
bidding
them
enter
into
the
*NL*
kingdom
,
the
eternity
of
bliss
prepared
for
them
.
The
unjust
He
casts
*NL*
from
Him
,
crying
in
His
offended
majesty
:
DEPART
FROM
ME
,
YE
CURSED
,
*NL*
INTO
EVERLASTING
FIRE
WHICH
WAS
PREPARED
FOR
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
ANGELS
.
*NL*
O
,
what
agony
then
for
the
miserable
sinners
!
Friend
is
torn
apart
from
*NL*
friend
,
children
are
torn
from
their
parents
,
husbands
from
their
*NL*
wives
.
The
poor
sinner
holds
out
his
arms
to
those
who
were
dear
to
him
*NL*
in
this
earthly
world
,
to
those
whose
simple
piety
perhaps
he
made
a
*NL*
mock
of
,
to
those
who
counselled
him
and
tried
to
lead
him
on
the
right
*NL*
path
,
to
a
kind
brother
,
to
a
loving
sister
,
to
the
mother
and
father
*NL*
who
loved
him
so
dearly
.
But
it
is
too
late
:
the
just
turn
away
from
*NL*
the
wretched
damned
souls
which
now
appear
before
the
eyes
of
all
in
*NL*
their
hideous
and
evil
character
.
O
you
hypocrites
,
O
,
you
whited
*NL*
sepulchres
,
O
you
who
present
a
smooth
smiling
face
to
the
world
while
*NL*
your
soul
within
is
a
foul
swamp
of
sin
,
how
will
it
fare
with
you
in
*NL*
that
terrible
day
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
day
will
come
,
shall
come
,
must
come
:
the
day
of
death
and
the
*NL*
day
of
judgement
.
It
is
appointed
unto
man
to
die
and
after
death
the
*NL*
judgement
.
Death
is
certain
.
The
time
and
manner
are
uncertain
,
whether
*NL*
from
long
disease
or
from
some
unexpected
accident
:
the
Son
of
God
*NL*
cometh
at
an
hour
when
you
little
expect
Him
.
Be
therefore
ready
every
*NL*
moment
,
seeing
that
you
may
die
at
any
moment
.
Death
is
the
end
of
us
*NL*
all
.
Death
and
judgement
,
brought
into
the
world
by
the
sin
of
our
*NL*
first
parents
,
are
the
dark
portals
that
close
our
earthly
existence
,
*NL*
the
portals
that
open
into
the
unknown
and
the
unseen
,
portals
through
*NL*
which
every
soul
must
pass
,
alone
,
unaided
save
by
its
good
works
,
*NL*
without
friend
or
brother
or
parent
or
master
to
help
it
,
alone
and
*NL*
trembling
.
Let
that
thought
be
ever
before
our
minds
and
then
we
can
not
*NL*
sin
.
Death
,
a
cause
of
terror
to
the
sinner
,
is
a
blessed
moment
for
*NL*
him
who
has
walked
in
the
right
path
,
fulfilling
the
duties
of
his
*NL*
station
in
life
,
attending
to
his
morning
and
evening
prayers
,
*NL*
approaching
the
holy
sacrament
frequently
and
performing
good
and
*NL*
merciful
works
.
For
the
pious
and
believing
catholic
,
for
the
just
man
,
*NL*
death
is
no
cause
of
terror
.
Was
it
not
Addison
,
the
great
English
*NL*
writer
,
who
,
when
on
his
deathbed
,
sent
for
the
wicked
young
earl
of
*NL*
Warwick
to
let
him
see
how
a
christian
can
meet
his
end
?
He
it
is
and
he
*NL*
alone
,
the
pious
and
believing
christian
,
who
can
say
in
his
heart
:
*NL*
*NL*
O
grave
,
where
is
thy
victory
?
*NL*
O
death
,
where
is
thy
sting
?
*NL*
*NL*
Every
word
of
it
was
for
him
.
Against
his
sin
,
foul
and
secret
,
the
*NL*
whole
wrath
of
God
was
aimed
.
The
preacher
's
knife
had
probed
deeply
*NL*
into
his
disclosed
conscience
and
he
felt
now
that
his
soul
was
*NL*
festering
in
sin
.
Yes
,
the
preacher
was
right
.
God
's
turn
had
come
.
*NL*
Like
a
beast
in
its
lair
his
soul
had
lain
down
in
its
own
filth
but
*NL*
the
blasts
of
the
angel
's
trumpet
had
driven
him
forth
from
the
*NL*
darkness
of
sin
into
the
light
.
The
words
of
doom
cried
by
the
angel
*NL*
shattered
in
an
instant
his
presumptuous
peace
.
The
wind
of
the
last
*NL*
day
blew
through
his
mind
,
his
sins
,
the
jewel-eyed
harlots
of
his
*NL*
imagination
,
fled
before
the
hurricane
,
squeaking
like
mice
in
their
*NL*
terror
and
huddled
under
a
mane
of
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
crossed
the
square
,
walking
homeward
,
the
light
laughter
of
a
*NL*
girl
reached
his
burning
ear
.
The
frail
gay
sound
smote
his
heart
more
*NL*
strongly
than
a
trumpet
blast
,
and
,
not
daring
to
lift
his
eyes
,
he
*NL*
turned
aside
and
gazed
,
as
he
walked
,
into
the
shadow
of
the
tangled
*NL*
shrubs
.
Shame
rose
from
his
smitten
heart
and
flooded
his
whole
being
.
*NL*
The
image
of
Emma
appeared
before
him
,
and
under
her
eyes
the
flood
of
*NL*
shame
rushed
forth
anew
from
his
heart
.
If
she
knew
to
what
his
mind
*NL*
had
subjected
her
or
how
his
brute-like
lust
had
torn
and
trampled
upon
*NL*
her
innocence
!
Was
that
boyish
love
?
Was
that
chivalry
?
Was
that
*NL*
poetry
?
The
sordid
details
of
his
orgies
stank
under
his
very
nostrils
.
*NL*
The
soot-coated
packet
of
pictures
which
he
had
hidden
in
the
flue
of
*NL*
the
fireplace
and
in
the
presence
of
whose
shameless
or
bashful
*NL*
wantonness
he
lay
for
hours
sinning
in
thought
and
deed
;
his
monstrous
*NL*
dreams
,
peopled
by
ape-like
creatures
and
by
harlots
with
gleaming
*NL*
jewel
eyes
;
the
foul
long
letters
he
had
written
in
the
joy
of
guilty
*NL*
confession
and
carried
secretly
for
days
and
days
only
to
throw
them
*NL*
under
cover
of
night
among
the
grass
in
the
corner
of
a
field
or
*NL*
beneath
some
hingeless
door
in
some
niche
in
the
hedges
where
a
girl
*NL*
might
come
upon
them
as
she
walked
by
and
read
them
secretly
.
Mad
!
Mad
!
*NL*
Was
it
possible
he
had
done
these
things
?
A
cold
sweat
broke
out
upon
*NL*
his
forehead
as
the
foul
memories
condensed
within
his
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
agony
of
shame
had
passed
from
him
he
tried
to
raise
his
soul
*NL*
from
its
abject
powerlessness
.
God
and
the
Blessed
Virgin
were
too
far
*NL*
from
him
:
God
was
too
great
and
stern
and
the
Blessed
Virgin
too
pure
*NL*
and
holy
.
But
he
imagined
that
he
stood
near
Emma
in
a
wide
land
and
,
*NL*
humbly
and
in
tears
,
bent
and
kissed
the
elbow
of
her
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
wide
land
under
a
tender
lucid
evening
sky
,
a
cloud
drifting
*NL*
westward
amid
a
pale
green
sea
of
heaven
,
they
stood
together
,
children
*NL*
that
had
erred
.
Their
error
had
offended
deeply
God
's
majesty
though
it
*NL*
was
the
error
of
two
children
;
but
it
had
not
offended
her
whose
beauty
*NL*
IS
NOT
LIKE
EARTHLY
BEAUTY
,
DANGEROUS
TO
LOOK
UPON
,
BUT
LIKE
THE
*NL*
MORNING
STAR
WHICH
IS
ITS
EMBLEM
,
BRIGHT
AND
MUSICAL
.
The
eyes
were
*NL*
not
offended
which
she
turned
upon
him
nor
reproachful
.
She
placed
*NL*
their
hands
together
,
hand
in
hand
,
and
said
,
speaking
to
their
hearts
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Take
hands
,
Stephen
and
Emma
.
It
is
a
beautiful
evening
now
in
*NL*
heaven
.
You
have
erred
but
you
are
always
my
children
.
It
is
one
heart
*NL*
that
loves
another
heart
.
Take
hands
together
,
my
dear
children
,
and
*NL*
you
will
be
happy
together
and
your
hearts
will
love
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chapel
was
flooded
by
the
dull
scarlet
light
that
filtered
through
*NL*
the
lowered
blinds
;
and
through
the
fissure
between
the
last
blind
and
*NL*
the
sash
a
shaft
of
wan
light
entered
like
a
spear
and
touched
the
*NL*
embossed
brasses
of
the
candlesticks
upon
the
altar
that
gleamed
like
*NL*
the
battle-worn
mail
armour
of
angels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rain
was
falling
on
the
chapel
,
on
the
garden
,
on
the
college
.
It
would
*NL*
rain
for
ever
,
noiselessly
.
The
water
would
rise
inch
by
inch
,
covering
*NL*
the
grass
and
shrubs
,
covering
the
trees
and
houses
,
covering
the
*NL*
monuments
and
the
mountain
tops
.
All
life
would
be
choked
off
,
*NL*
noiselessly
:
birds
,
men
,
elephants
,
pigs
,
children
:
noiselessly
*NL*
floating
corpses
amid
the
litter
of
the
wreckage
of
the
world
.
Forty
*NL*
days
and
forty
nights
the
rain
would
fall
till
the
waters
covered
the
*NL*
face
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
.
Why
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
HELL
HAS
ENLARGED
ITS
SOUL
AND
OPENED
ITS
MOUTH
WITHOUT
ANY
*NL*
LIMITS
--
words
taken
,
my
dear
little
brothers
in
Christ
Jesus
,
from
the
*NL*
book
of
Isaias
,
fifth
chapter
,
fourteenth
verse
.
In
the
name
of
the
*NL*
Father
and
of
the
Son
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost
.
Amen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
preacher
took
a
chainless
watch
from
a
pocket
within
his
soutane
*NL*
and
,
having
considered
its
dial
for
a
moment
in
silence
,
placed
it
*NL*
silently
before
him
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
speak
in
a
quiet
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Adam
and
Eve
,
my
dear
boys
,
were
,
as
you
know
,
our
first
parents
,
*NL*
and
you
will
remember
that
they
were
created
by
God
in
order
that
the
*NL*
seats
in
heaven
left
vacant
by
the
fall
of
Lucifer
and
his
rebellious
*NL*
angels
might
be
filled
again
.
Lucifer
,
we
are
told
,
was
a
son
of
the
*NL*
morning
,
a
radiant
and
mighty
angel
;
yet
he
fell
:
he
fell
and
there
*NL*
fell
with
him
a
third
part
of
the
host
of
heaven
:
he
fell
and
was
*NL*
hurled
with
his
rebellious
angels
into
hell
.
What
his
sin
was
we
can
not
*NL*
say
.
Theologians
consider
that
it
was
the
sin
of
pride
,
the
sinful
*NL*
thought
conceived
in
an
instant
:
NON
SERVIAM
:
I
WILL
NOT
SERVE
.
That
*NL*
instant
was
his
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
offended
the
majesty
of
God
by
the
sinful
thought
of
one
instant
and
*NL*
God
cast
him
out
of
heaven
into
hell
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Adam
and
Eve
were
then
created
by
God
and
placed
in
Eden
,
in
the
*NL*
plain
of
Damascus
,
that
lovely
garden
resplendent
with
sunlight
and
*NL*
colour
,
teeming
with
luxuriant
vegetation
.
The
fruitful
earth
gave
them
*NL*
her
bounty
:
beasts
and
birds
were
their
willing
servants
:
they
knew
not
*NL*
the
ills
our
flesh
is
heir
to
,
disease
and
poverty
and
death
:
all
that
*NL*
a
great
and
generous
God
could
do
for
them
was
done
.
But
there
was
one
*NL*
condition
imposed
on
them
by
God
:
obedience
to
His
word
.
They
were
not
*NL*
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
forbidden
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Alas
,
my
dear
little
boys
,
they
too
fell
.
The
devil
,
once
a
shining
*NL*
angel
,
a
son
of
the
morning
,
now
a
foul
fiend
came
in
the
shape
of
a
*NL*
serpent
,
the
subtlest
of
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
.
He
envied
them
.
*NL*
He
,
the
fallen
great
one
,
could
not
bear
to
think
that
man
,
a
being
of
*NL*
clay
,
should
possess
the
inheritance
which
he
by
his
sin
had
forfeited
*NL*
for
ever
.
He
came
to
the
woman
,
the
weaker
vessel
,
and
poured
the
*NL*
poison
of
his
eloquence
into
her
ear
,
promising
her
--
O
,
the
blasphemy
*NL*
of
that
promise
!
--
that
if
she
and
Adam
ate
of
the
forbidden
fruit
they
*NL*
would
become
as
gods
,
nay
as
God
Himself
.
Eve
yielded
to
the
wiles
of
*NL*
the
archtempter
.
She
ate
the
apple
and
gave
it
also
to
Adam
who
had
not
*NL*
the
moral
courage
to
resist
her
.
The
poison
tongue
of
Satan
had
done
*NL*
its
work
.
They
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
then
the
voice
of
God
was
heard
in
that
garden
,
calling
His
*NL*
creature
man
to
account
:
and
Michael
,
prince
of
the
heavenly
host
,
with
*NL*
a
sword
of
flame
in
his
hand
,
appeared
before
the
guilty
pair
and
drove
*NL*
them
forth
from
Eden
into
the
world
,
the
world
of
sickness
and
*NL*
striving
,
of
cruelty
and
disappointment
,
of
labour
and
hardship
,
to
*NL*
earn
their
bread
in
the
sweat
of
their
brow
.
But
even
then
how
merciful
*NL*
was
God
!
He
took
pity
on
our
poor
degraded
parents
and
promised
that
in
*NL*
the
fullness
of
time
He
would
send
down
from
heaven
One
who
would
*NL*
redeem
them
,
make
them
once
more
children
of
God
and
heirs
to
the
*NL*
kingdom
of
heaven
:
and
that
One
,
that
Redeemer
of
fallen
man
,
was
to
be
*NL*
God
's
only
begotten
Son
,
the
Second
Person
of
the
Most
Blessed
Trinity
,
*NL*
the
Eternal
Word
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
came
.
He
was
born
of
a
virgin
pure
,
Mary
the
virgin
mother
.
He
*NL*
was
born
in
a
poor
cowhouse
in
Judea
and
lived
as
a
humble
carpenter
*NL*
for
thirty
years
until
the
hour
of
His
mission
had
come
.
And
then
,
*NL*
filled
with
love
for
men
,
He
went
forth
and
called
to
men
to
hear
the
*NL*
new
gospel
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
they
listen
?
Yes
,
they
listened
but
would
not
hear
.
He
was
*NL*
seized
and
bound
like
a
common
criminal
,
mocked
at
as
a
fool
,
set
aside
*NL*
to
give
place
to
a
public
robber
,
scourged
with
five
thousand
lashes
,
*NL*
crowned
with
a
crown
of
thorns
,
hustled
through
the
streets
by
the
*NL*
jewish
rabble
and
the
Roman
soldiery
,
stripped
of
his
garments
and
*NL*
hanged
upon
a
gibbet
and
His
side
was
pierced
with
a
lance
and
from
the
*NL*
wounded
body
of
our
Lord
water
and
blood
issued
continually
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yet
even
then
,
in
that
hour
of
supreme
agony
,
Our
Merciful
Redeemer
had
*NL*
pity
for
mankind
.
Yet
even
there
,
on
the
hill
of
Calvary
,
He
founded
*NL*
the
holy
catholic
church
against
which
,
it
is
promised
,
the
gates
of
*NL*
hell
shall
not
prevail
.
He
founded
it
upon
the
rock
of
ages
,
and
*NL*
endowed
it
with
His
grace
,
with
sacraments
and
sacrifice
,
and
promised
*NL*
that
if
men
would
obey
the
word
of
His
church
they
would
still
enter
*NL*
into
eternal
life
;
but
if
,
after
all
that
had
been
done
for
them
,
they
*NL*
still
persisted
in
their
wickedness
,
there
remained
for
them
an
*NL*
eternity
of
torment
:
hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
preacher
's
voice
sank
.
He
paused
,
joined
his
palms
for
an
instant
,
*NL*
parted
them
.
Then
he
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
let
us
try
for
a
moment
to
realize
,
as
far
as
we
can
,
the
nature
*NL*
of
that
abode
of
the
damned
which
the
justice
of
an
offended
God
has
*NL*
called
into
existence
for
the
eternal
punishment
of
sinners
.
Hell
is
a
*NL*
strait
and
dark
and
foul-smelling
prison
,
an
abode
of
demons
and
lost
*NL*
souls
,
filled
with
fire
and
smoke
.
The
straitness
of
this
prison
house
*NL*
is
expressly
designed
by
God
to
punish
those
who
refused
to
be
bound
by
*NL*
His
laws
.
In
earthly
prisons
the
poor
captive
has
at
least
some
liberty
*NL*
of
movement
,
were
it
only
within
the
four
walls
of
his
cell
or
in
the
*NL*
gloomy
yard
of
his
prison
.
Not
so
in
hell
.
There
,
by
reason
of
the
*NL*
great
number
of
the
damned
,
the
prisoners
are
heaped
together
in
their
*NL*
awful
prison
,
the
walls
of
which
are
said
to
be
four
thousand
miles
*NL*
thick
:
and
the
damned
are
so
utterly
bound
and
helpless
that
,
as
a
*NL*
blessed
saint
,
saint
Anselm
,
writes
in
his
book
on
similitudes
,
they
*NL*
are
not
even
able
to
remove
from
the
eye
a
worm
that
gnaws
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
lie
in
exterior
darkness
.
For
,
remember
,
the
fire
of
hell
gives
*NL*
forth
no
light
.
As
,
at
the
command
of
God
,
the
fire
of
the
Babylonian
*NL*
furnace
lost
its
heat
but
not
its
light
,
so
,
at
the
command
of
God
,
the
*NL*
fire
of
hell
,
while
retaining
the
intensity
of
its
heat
,
burns
*NL*
eternally
in
darkness
.
It
is
a
never
ending
storm
of
darkness
,
dark
*NL*
flames
and
dark
smoke
of
burning
brimstone
,
amid
which
the
bodies
are
*NL*
heaped
one
upon
another
without
even
a
glimpse
of
air
.
Of
all
the
*NL*
plagues
with
which
the
land
of
the
Pharaohs
were
smitten
one
plague
*NL*
alone
,
that
of
darkness
,
was
called
horrible
.
What
name
,
then
,
shall
we
*NL*
give
to
the
darkness
of
hell
which
is
to
last
not
for
three
days
alone
*NL*
but
for
all
eternity
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
horror
of
this
strait
and
dark
prison
is
increased
by
its
awful
*NL*
stench
.
All
the
filth
of
the
world
,
all
the
offal
and
scum
of
the
*NL*
world
,
we
are
told
,
shall
run
there
as
to
a
vast
reeking
sewer
when
the
*NL*
terrible
conflagration
of
the
last
day
has
purged
the
world
.
The
*NL*
brimstone
,
too
,
which
burns
there
in
such
prodigious
quantity
fills
all
*NL*
hell
with
its
intolerable
stench
;
and
the
bodies
of
the
damned
*NL*
themselves
exhale
such
a
pestilential
odour
that
,
as
saint
Bonaventure
*NL*
says
,
one
of
them
alone
would
suffice
to
infect
the
whole
world
.
The
*NL*
very
air
of
this
world
,
that
pure
element
,
becomes
foul
and
*NL*
unbreathable
when
it
has
been
long
enclosed
.
Consider
then
what
must
be
*NL*
the
foulness
of
the
air
of
hell
.
Imagine
some
foul
and
putrid
corpse
*NL*
that
has
lain
rotting
and
decomposing
in
the
grave
,
a
jelly-like
mass
*NL*
of
liquid
corruption
.
Imagine
such
a
corpse
a
prey
to
flames
,
devoured
*NL*
by
the
fire
of
burning
brimstone
and
giving
off
dense
choking
fumes
of
*NL*
nauseous
loathsome
decomposition
.
And
then
imagine
this
sickening
*NL*
stench
,
multiplied
a
millionfold
and
a
millionfold
again
from
the
*NL*
millions
upon
millions
of
fetid
carcasses
massed
together
in
the
*NL*
reeking
darkness
,
a
huge
and
rotting
human
fungus
.
Imagine
all
this
,
*NL*
and
you
will
have
some
idea
of
the
horror
of
the
stench
of
hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
this
stench
is
not
,
horrible
though
it
is
,
the
greatest
physical
*NL*
torment
to
which
the
damned
are
subjected
.
The
torment
of
fire
is
the
*NL*
greatest
torment
to
which
the
tyrant
has
ever
subjected
his
fellow
*NL*
creatures
.
Place
your
finger
for
a
moment
in
the
flame
of
a
candle
and
*NL*
you
will
feel
the
pain
of
fire
.
But
our
earthly
fire
was
created
by
God
*NL*
for
the
benefit
of
man
,
to
maintain
in
him
the
spark
of
life
and
to
*NL*
help
him
in
the
useful
arts
,
whereas
the
fire
of
hell
is
of
another
*NL*
quality
and
was
created
by
God
to
torture
and
punish
the
unrepentant
*NL*
sinner
.
Our
earthly
fire
also
consumes
more
or
less
rapidly
according
*NL*
as
the
object
which
it
attacks
is
more
or
less
combustible
,
so
that
*NL*
human
ingenuity
has
even
succeeded
in
inventing
chemical
preparations
*NL*
to
check
or
frustrate
its
action
.
But
the
sulphurous
brimstone
which
*NL*
burns
in
hell
is
a
substance
which
is
specially
designed
to
burn
for
*NL*
ever
and
for
ever
with
unspeakable
fury
.
Moreover
,
our
earthly
fire
*NL*
destroys
at
the
same
time
as
it
burns
,
so
that
the
more
intense
it
is
*NL*
the
shorter
is
its
duration
;
but
the
fire
of
hell
has
this
property
,
*NL*
that
it
preserves
that
which
it
burns
,
and
,
though
it
rages
with
*NL*
incredible
intensity
,
it
rages
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Our
earthly
fire
again
,
no
matter
how
fierce
or
widespread
it
may
be
,
*NL*
is
always
of
a
limited
extent
;
but
the
lake
of
fire
in
hell
is
*NL*
boundless
,
shoreless
and
bottomless
.
It
is
on
record
that
the
devil
*NL*
himself
,
when
asked
the
question
by
a
certain
soldier
,
was
obliged
to
*NL*
confess
that
if
a
whole
mountain
were
thrown
into
the
burning
ocean
of
*NL*
hell
it
would
be
burned
up
in
an
instant
like
a
piece
of
wax
.
And
this
*NL*
terrible
fire
will
not
afflict
the
bodies
of
the
damned
only
from
*NL*
without
,
but
each
lost
soul
will
be
a
hell
unto
itself
,
the
boundless
*NL*
fire
raging
in
its
very
vitals
.
O
,
how
terrible
is
the
lot
of
those
*NL*
wretched
beings
!
The
blood
seethes
and
boils
in
the
veins
,
the
brains
*NL*
are
boiling
in
the
skull
,
the
heart
in
the
breast
glowing
and
bursting
,
*NL*
the
bowels
a
red-hot
mass
of
burning
pulp
,
the
tender
eyes
flaming
like
*NL*
molten
balls
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
yet
what
I
have
said
as
to
the
strength
and
quality
and
*NL*
boundlessness
of
this
fire
is
as
nothing
when
compared
to
its
*NL*
intensity
,
an
intensity
which
it
has
as
being
the
instrument
chosen
by
*NL*
divine
design
for
the
punishment
of
soul
and
body
alike
.
It
is
a
fire
*NL*
which
proceeds
directly
from
the
ire
of
God
,
working
not
of
its
own
*NL*
activity
but
as
an
instrument
of
Divine
vengeance
.
As
the
waters
of
*NL*
baptism
cleanse
the
soul
with
the
body
,
so
do
the
fires
of
punishment
*NL*
torture
the
spirit
with
the
flesh
.
Every
sense
of
the
flesh
is
tortured
*NL*
and
every
faculty
of
the
soul
therewith
:
the
eyes
with
impenetrable
*NL*
utter
darkness
,
the
nose
with
noisome
odours
,
the
ears
with
yells
and
*NL*
howls
and
execrations
,
the
taste
with
foul
matter
,
leprous
corruption
,
*NL*
nameless
suffocating
filth
,
the
touch
with
redhot
goads
and
spikes
,
*NL*
with
cruel
tongues
of
flame
.
And
through
the
several
torments
of
the
*NL*
senses
the
immortal
soul
is
tortured
eternally
in
its
very
essence
amid
*NL*
the
leagues
upon
leagues
of
glowing
fires
kindled
in
the
abyss
by
the
*NL*
offended
majesty
of
the
Omnipotent
God
and
fanned
into
everlasting
and
*NL*
ever-increasing
fury
by
the
breath
of
the
anger
of
the
God-head
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Consider
finally
that
the
torment
of
this
infernal
prison
is
*NL*
increased
by
the
company
of
the
damned
themselves
.
Evil
company
on
*NL*
earth
is
so
noxious
that
the
plants
,
as
if
by
instinct
,
withdraw
from
*NL*
the
company
of
whatsoever
is
deadly
or
hurtful
to
them
.
In
hell
all
*NL*
laws
are
overturned
--
there
is
no
thought
of
family
or
country
,
of
*NL*
ties
,
of
relationships
.
The
damned
howl
and
scream
at
one
another
,
*NL*
their
torture
and
rage
intensified
by
the
presence
of
beings
tortured
*NL*
and
raging
like
themselves
.
All
sense
of
humanity
is
forgotten
.
The
*NL*
yells
of
the
suffering
sinners
fill
the
remotest
corners
of
the
vast
*NL*
abyss
.
The
mouths
of
the
damned
are
full
of
blasphemies
against
God
and
*NL*
of
hatred
for
their
fellow
sufferers
and
of
curses
against
those
souls
*NL*
which
were
their
accomplices
in
sin
.
In
olden
times
it
was
the
custom
*NL*
to
punish
the
parricide
,
the
man
who
had
raised
his
murderous
hand
*NL*
against
his
father
,
by
casting
him
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
in
a
sack
*NL*
in
which
were
placed
a
cock
,
a
monkey
,
and
a
serpent
.
The
intention
of
*NL*
those
law-givers
who
framed
such
a
law
,
which
seems
cruel
in
our
times
,
*NL*
was
to
punish
the
criminal
by
the
company
of
hurtful
and
hateful
*NL*
beasts
.
But
what
is
the
fury
of
those
dumb
beasts
compared
with
the
*NL*
fury
of
execration
which
bursts
from
the
parched
lips
and
aching
*NL*
throats
of
the
damned
in
hell
when
they
behold
in
their
companions
in
*NL*
misery
those
who
aided
and
abetted
them
in
sin
,
those
whose
words
sowed
*NL*
the
first
seeds
of
evil
thinking
and
evil
living
in
their
minds
,
those
*NL*
whose
immodest
suggestions
led
them
on
to
sin
,
those
whose
eyes
tempted
*NL*
and
allured
them
from
the
path
of
virtue
.
They
turn
upon
those
*NL*
accomplices
and
upbraid
them
and
curse
them
.
But
they
are
helpless
and
*NL*
hopeless
:
it
is
too
late
now
for
repentance
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Last
of
all
consider
the
frightful
torment
to
those
damned
souls
,
*NL*
tempters
and
tempted
alike
,
of
the
company
of
the
devils
.
These
devils
*NL*
will
afflict
the
damned
in
two
ways
,
by
their
presence
and
by
their
*NL*
reproaches
.
We
can
have
no
idea
of
how
horrible
these
devils
are
.
Saint
*NL*
Catherine
of
Siena
once
saw
a
devil
and
she
has
written
that
,
rather
*NL*
than
look
again
for
one
single
instant
on
such
a
frightful
monster
,
she
*NL*
would
prefer
to
walk
until
the
end
of
her
life
along
a
track
of
red
*NL*
coals
.
These
devils
,
who
were
once
beautiful
angels
,
have
become
as
*NL*
hideous
and
ugly
as
they
once
were
beautiful
.
They
mock
and
jeer
at
the
*NL*
lost
souls
whom
they
dragged
down
to
ruin
.
It
is
they
,
the
foul
demons
,
*NL*
who
are
made
in
hell
the
voices
of
conscience
.
Why
did
you
sin
?
Why
did
*NL*
you
lend
an
ear
to
the
temptings
of
friends
?
Why
did
you
turn
aside
*NL*
from
your
pious
practices
and
good
works
?
Why
did
you
not
shun
the
*NL*
occasions
of
sin
?
Why
did
you
not
leave
that
evil
companion
?
Why
did
*NL*
you
not
give
up
that
lewd
habit
,
that
impure
habit
?
Why
did
you
not
*NL*
listen
to
the
counsels
of
your
confessor
?
Why
did
you
not
,
even
after
*NL*
you
had
fallen
the
first
or
the
second
or
the
third
or
the
fourth
or
*NL*
the
hundredth
time
,
repent
of
your
evil
ways
and
turn
to
God
who
only
*NL*
waited
for
your
repentance
to
absolve
you
of
your
sins
?
Now
the
time
*NL*
for
repentance
has
gone
by
.
Time
is
,
time
was
,
but
time
shall
be
no
more
!
*NL*
Time
was
to
sin
in
secrecy
,
to
indulge
in
that
sloth
and
pride
,
to
*NL*
covet
the
unlawful
,
to
yield
to
the
promptings
of
your
lower
nature
,
to
*NL*
live
like
the
beasts
of
the
field
,
nay
worse
than
the
beasts
of
the
*NL*
field
,
for
they
,
at
least
,
are
but
brutes
and
have
no
reason
to
guide
*NL*
them
:
time
was
,
but
time
shall
be
no
more
.
God
spoke
to
you
by
so
many
*NL*
voices
,
but
you
would
not
hear
.
You
would
not
crush
out
that
pride
and
*NL*
anger
in
your
heart
,
you
would
not
restore
those
ill-gotten
goods
,
you
*NL*
would
not
obey
the
precepts
of
your
holy
church
nor
attend
to
your
*NL*
religious
duties
,
you
would
not
abandon
those
wicked
companions
,
you
*NL*
would
not
avoid
those
dangerous
temptations
.
Such
is
the
language
of
*NL*
those
fiendish
tormentors
,
words
of
taunting
and
of
reproach
,
of
hatred
*NL*
and
of
disgust
.
Of
disgust
,
yes
!
For
even
they
,
the
very
devils
,
when
*NL*
they
sinned
,
sinned
by
such
a
sin
as
alone
was
compatible
with
such
*NL*
angelical
natures
,
a
rebellion
of
the
intellect
:
and
they
,
even
they
,
*NL*
the
foul
devils
must
turn
away
,
revolted
and
disgusted
,
from
the
*NL*
contemplation
of
those
unspeakable
sins
by
which
degraded
man
outrages
*NL*
and
defiles
the
temple
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
defiles
and
pollutes
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
my
dear
little
brothers
in
Christ
,
may
it
never
be
our
lot
to
*NL*
hear
that
language
!
May
it
never
be
our
lot
,
I
say
!
In
the
last
day
of
*NL*
terrible
reckoning
I
pray
fervently
to
God
that
not
a
single
soul
of
*NL*
those
who
are
in
this
chapel
today
may
be
found
among
those
miserable
*NL*
beings
whom
the
Great
Judge
shall
command
to
depart
for
ever
from
His
*NL*
sight
,
that
not
one
of
us
may
ever
hear
ringing
in
his
ears
the
awful
*NL*
sentence
of
rejection
:
DEPART
FROM
ME
,
YE
CURSED
,
INTO
EVERLASTING
FIRE
*NL*
WHICH
WAS
PREPARED
FOR
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
ANGELS
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
down
the
aisle
of
the
chapel
,
his
legs
shaking
and
the
scalp
of
*NL*
his
head
trembling
as
though
it
had
been
touched
by
ghostly
fingers
.
He
*NL*
passed
up
the
staircase
and
into
the
corridor
along
the
walls
of
which
*NL*
the
overcoats
and
waterproofs
hung
like
gibbeted
malefactors
,
headless
*NL*
and
dripping
and
shapeless
.
And
at
every
step
he
feared
that
he
had
*NL*
already
died
,
that
his
soul
had
been
wrenched
forth
of
the
sheath
of
*NL*
his
body
,
that
he
was
plunging
headlong
through
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
grip
the
floor
with
his
feet
and
sat
heavily
at
his
desk
,
*NL*
opening
one
of
his
books
at
random
and
poring
over
it
.
Every
word
for
*NL*
him
.
It
was
true
.
God
was
almighty
.
God
could
call
him
now
,
call
him
as
*NL*
he
sat
at
his
desk
,
before
he
had
time
to
be
conscious
of
the
summons
.
*NL*
God
had
called
him
.
Yes
?
What
?
Yes
?
His
flesh
shrank
together
as
it
*NL*
felt
the
approach
of
the
ravenous
tongues
of
flames
,
dried
up
as
it
*NL*
felt
about
it
the
swirl
of
stifling
air
.
He
had
died
.
Yes
.
He
was
*NL*
judged
.
A
wave
of
fire
swept
through
his
body
:
the
first
.
Again
a
wave
.
*NL*
His
brain
began
to
glow
.
Another
.
His
brain
was
simmering
and
bubbling
*NL*
within
the
cracking
tenement
of
the
skull
.
Flames
burst
forth
from
his
*NL*
skull
like
a
corolla
,
shrieking
like
voices
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hell
!
Hell
!
Hell
!
Hell
!
Hell
!
*NL*
*NL*
Voices
spoke
near
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
On
hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
suppose
he
rubbed
it
into
you
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
bet
he
did
.
He
put
us
all
into
a
blue
funk
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
what
you
fellows
want
:
and
plenty
of
it
to
make
you
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
back
weakly
in
his
desk
.
He
had
not
died
.
God
had
spared
him
*NL*
still
.
He
was
still
in
the
familiar
world
of
the
school
.
Mr
Tate
and
*NL*
Vincent
Heron
stood
at
the
window
,
talking
,
jesting
,
gazing
out
at
the
*NL*
bleak
rain
,
moving
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
wish
it
would
clear
up
.
I
had
arranged
to
go
for
a
spin
on
the
*NL*
bike
with
some
fellows
out
by
Malahide
.
But
the
roads
must
be
*NL*
knee-deep
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
might
clear
up
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
voices
that
he
knew
so
well
,
the
common
words
,
the
quiet
of
the
*NL*
classroom
when
the
voices
paused
and
the
silence
was
filled
by
the
*NL*
sound
of
softly
browsing
cattle
as
the
other
boys
munched
their
lunches
*NL*
tranquilly
,
lulled
his
aching
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
still
time
.
O
Mary
,
refuge
of
sinners
,
intercede
for
him
!
O
*NL*
Virgin
Undefiled
,
save
him
from
the
gulf
of
death
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
English
lesson
began
with
the
hearing
of
the
history
.
Royal
*NL*
persons
,
favourites
,
intriguers
,
bishops
,
passed
like
mute
phantoms
*NL*
behind
their
veil
of
names
.
All
had
died
:
all
had
been
judged
.
What
did
*NL*
it
profit
a
man
to
gain
the
whole
world
if
he
lost
his
soul
?
At
last
he
*NL*
had
understood
:
and
human
life
lay
around
him
,
a
plain
of
peace
whereon
*NL*
ant-like
men
laboured
in
brotherhood
,
their
dead
sleeping
under
quiet
*NL*
mounds
.
The
elbow
of
his
companion
touched
him
and
his
heart
was
*NL*
touched
:
and
when
he
spoke
to
answer
a
question
of
his
master
he
heard
*NL*
his
own
voice
full
of
the
quietude
of
humility
and
contrition
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
soul
sank
back
deeper
into
depths
of
contrite
peace
,
no
longer
able
*NL*
to
suffer
the
pain
of
dread
,
and
sending
forth
,
as
he
sank
,
a
faint
*NL*
prayer
.
Ah
yes
,
he
would
still
be
spared
;
he
would
repent
in
his
heart
*NL*
and
be
forgiven
;
and
then
those
above
,
those
in
heaven
,
would
see
what
*NL*
he
would
do
to
make
up
for
the
past
:
a
whole
life
,
every
hour
of
life
.
*NL*
Only
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
All
,
God
!
All
,
all
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
messenger
came
to
the
door
to
say
that
confessions
were
being
heard
*NL*
in
the
chapel
.
Four
boys
left
the
room
;
and
he
heard
others
passing
*NL*
down
the
corridor
.
A
tremulous
chill
blew
round
his
heart
,
no
stronger
*NL*
than
a
little
wind
,
and
yet
,
listening
and
suffering
silently
,
he
*NL*
seemed
to
have
laid
an
ear
against
the
muscle
of
his
own
heart
,
feeling
*NL*
it
close
and
quail
,
listening
to
the
flutter
of
its
ventricles
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
escape
.
He
had
to
confess
,
to
speak
out
in
words
what
he
had
done
*NL*
and
thought
,
sin
after
sin
.
How
?
How
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Father
,
I.
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
slid
like
a
cold
shining
rapier
into
his
tender
flesh
:
*NL*
confession
.
But
not
there
in
the
chapel
of
the
college
.
He
would
*NL*
confess
all
,
every
sin
of
deed
and
thought
,
sincerely
;
but
not
there
*NL*
among
his
school
companions
.
Far
away
from
there
in
some
dark
place
he
*NL*
would
murmur
out
his
own
shame
;
and
he
besought
God
humbly
not
to
be
*NL*
offended
with
him
if
he
did
not
dare
to
confess
in
the
college
chapel
*NL*
and
in
utter
abjection
of
spirit
he
craved
forgiveness
mutely
of
the
*NL*
boyish
hearts
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
again
in
the
front
bench
of
the
chapel
.
The
daylight
without
was
*NL*
already
failing
and
,
as
it
fell
slowly
through
the
dull
red
blinds
,
it
*NL*
seemed
that
the
sun
of
the
last
day
was
going
down
and
that
all
souls
*NL*
were
being
gathered
for
the
judgement
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
AM
CAST
AWAY
FROM
THE
SIGHT
OF
THINE
EYES
:
words
taken
,
my
dear
*NL*
little
brothers
in
Christ
,
from
the
Book
of
Psalms
,
thirtieth
chapter
,
*NL*
twenty-third
verse
.
In
the
name
of
the
Father
and
of
the
Son
and
of
the
*NL*
Holy
Ghost
.
Amen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
preacher
began
to
speak
in
a
quiet
friendly
tone
.
His
face
was
kind
*NL*
and
he
joined
gently
the
fingers
of
each
hand
,
forming
a
frail
cage
by
*NL*
the
union
of
their
tips
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
morning
we
endeavoured
,
in
our
reflection
upon
hell
,
to
make
*NL*
what
our
holy
founder
calls
in
his
book
of
spiritual
exercises
,
the
*NL*
composition
of
place
.
We
endeavoured
,
that
is
,
to
imagine
with
the
*NL*
senses
of
the
mind
,
in
our
imagination
,
the
material
character
of
that
*NL*
awful
place
and
of
the
physical
torments
which
all
who
are
in
hell
endure
.
*NL*
This
evening
we
shall
consider
for
a
few
moments
the
nature
of
the
*NL*
spiritual
torments
of
hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sin
,
remember
,
is
a
twofold
enormity
.
It
is
a
base
consent
to
the
*NL*
promptings
of
our
corrupt
nature
to
the
lower
instincts
,
to
that
which
*NL*
is
gross
and
beast-like
;
and
it
is
also
a
turning
away
from
the
counsel
*NL*
of
our
higher
nature
,
from
all
that
is
pure
and
holy
,
from
the
Holy
God
*NL*
Himself
.
For
this
reason
mortal
sin
is
punished
in
hell
by
two
*NL*
different
forms
of
punishment
,
physical
and
spiritual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
of
all
these
spiritual
pains
by
far
the
greatest
is
the
pain
of
*NL*
loss
,
so
great
,
in
fact
,
that
in
itself
it
is
a
torment
greater
than
*NL*
all
the
others
.
Saint
Thomas
,
the
greatest
doctor
of
the
church
,
the
*NL*
angelic
doctor
,
as
he
is
called
,
says
that
the
worst
damnation
consists
*NL*
in
this
,
that
the
understanding
of
man
is
totally
deprived
of
divine
*NL*
light
and
his
affection
obstinately
turned
away
from
the
goodness
of
*NL*
God
.
God
,
remember
,
is
a
being
infinitely
good
,
and
therefore
the
loss
*NL*
of
such
a
being
must
be
a
loss
infinitely
painful
.
In
this
life
we
have
*NL*
not
a
very
clear
idea
of
what
such
a
loss
must
be
,
but
the
damned
in
*NL*
hell
,
for
their
greater
torment
,
have
a
full
understanding
of
that
*NL*
which
they
have
lost
,
and
understand
that
they
have
lost
it
through
*NL*
their
own
sins
and
have
lost
it
for
ever
.
At
the
very
instant
of
death
*NL*
the
bonds
of
the
flesh
are
broken
asunder
and
the
soul
at
once
flies
*NL*
towards
God
as
towards
the
centre
of
her
existence
.
Remember
,
my
dear
*NL*
little
boys
,
our
souls
long
to
be
with
God
.
We
come
from
God
,
we
live
*NL*
by
God
,
we
belong
to
God
:
we
are
His
,
inalienably
His
.
God
loves
with
a
*NL*
divine
love
every
human
soul
,
and
every
human
soul
lives
in
that
love
.
*NL*
How
could
it
be
otherwise
?
Every
breath
that
we
draw
,
every
thought
of
*NL*
our
brain
,
every
instant
of
life
proceeds
from
God
's
inexhaustible
*NL*
goodness
.
And
if
it
be
pain
for
a
mother
to
be
parted
from
her
child
,
*NL*
for
a
man
to
be
exiled
from
hearth
and
home
,
for
friend
to
be
sundered
*NL*
from
friend
,
O
think
what
pain
,
what
anguish
it
must
be
for
the
poor
*NL*
soul
to
be
spurned
from
the
presence
of
the
supremely
good
and
loving
*NL*
Creator
Who
has
called
that
soul
into
existence
from
nothingness
and
*NL*
sustained
it
in
life
and
loved
it
with
an
immeasurable
love
.
This
,
*NL*
then
,
to
be
separated
for
ever
from
its
greatest
good
,
from
God
,
and
to
*NL*
feel
the
anguish
of
that
separation
,
knowing
full
well
that
it
is
*NL*
unchangeable
:
this
is
the
greatest
torment
which
the
created
soul
is
*NL*
capable
of
bearing
,
POENA
DAMNI
,
the
pain
of
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
pain
which
will
afflict
the
souls
of
the
damned
in
hell
is
*NL*
the
pain
of
conscience
.
Just
as
in
dead
bodies
worms
are
engendered
by
*NL*
putrefaction
,
so
in
the
souls
of
the
lost
there
arises
a
perpetual
*NL*
remorse
from
the
putrefaction
of
sin
,
the
sting
of
conscience
,
the
*NL*
worm
,
as
Pope
Innocent
the
Third
calls
it
,
of
the
triple
sting
.
The
*NL*
first
sting
inflicted
by
this
cruel
worm
will
be
the
memory
of
past
*NL*
pleasures
.
O
what
a
dreadful
memory
will
that
be
!
In
the
lake
of
*NL*
all-devouring
flame
the
proud
king
will
remember
the
pomps
of
his
*NL*
court
,
the
wise
but
wicked
man
his
libraries
and
instruments
of
*NL*
research
,
the
lover
of
artistic
pleasures
his
marbles
and
pictures
and
*NL*
other
art
treasures
,
he
who
delighted
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
his
*NL*
gorgeous
feasts
,
his
dishes
prepared
with
such
delicacy
,
his
choice
*NL*
wines
;
the
miser
will
remember
his
hoard
of
gold
,
the
robber
his
*NL*
ill-gotten
wealth
,
the
angry
and
revengeful
and
merciless
murderers
*NL*
their
deeds
of
blood
and
violence
in
which
they
revelled
,
the
impure
*NL*
and
adulterous
the
unspeakable
and
filthy
pleasures
in
which
they
*NL*
delighted
.
They
will
remember
all
this
and
loathe
themselves
and
their
*NL*
sins
.
For
how
miserable
will
all
those
pleasures
seem
to
the
soul
*NL*
condemned
to
suffer
in
hellfire
for
ages
and
ages
.
How
they
will
rage
*NL*
and
fume
to
think
that
they
have
lost
the
bliss
of
heaven
for
the
dross
*NL*
of
earth
,
for
a
few
pieces
of
metal
,
for
vain
honours
,
for
bodily
*NL*
comforts
,
for
a
tingling
of
the
nerves
.
They
will
repent
indeed
:
and
*NL*
this
is
the
second
sting
of
the
worm
of
conscience
,
a
late
and
*NL*
fruitless
sorrow
for
sins
committed
.
Divine
justice
insists
that
the
*NL*
understanding
of
those
miserable
wretches
be
fixed
continually
on
the
*NL*
sins
of
which
they
were
guilty
,
and
moreover
,
as
saint
Augustine
points
*NL*
out
,
God
will
impart
to
them
His
own
knowledge
of
sin
,
so
that
sin
will
*NL*
appear
to
them
in
all
its
hideous
malice
as
it
appears
to
the
eyes
of
*NL*
God
Himself
.
They
will
behold
their
sins
in
all
their
foulness
and
*NL*
repent
but
it
will
be
too
late
and
then
they
will
bewail
the
good
*NL*
occasions
which
they
neglected
.
This
is
the
last
and
deepest
and
most
*NL*
cruel
sting
of
the
worm
of
conscience
.
The
conscience
will
say
:
You
had
*NL*
time
and
opportunity
to
repent
and
would
not
.
You
were
brought
up
*NL*
religiously
by
your
parents
.
You
had
the
sacraments
and
grace
and
*NL*
indulgences
of
the
church
to
aid
you
.
You
had
the
minister
of
God
to
*NL*
preach
to
you
,
to
call
you
back
when
you
had
strayed
,
to
forgive
you
*NL*
your
sins
,
no
matter
how
many
,
how
abominable
,
if
only
you
had
*NL*
confessed
and
repented
.
No
.
You
would
not
.
You
flouted
the
ministers
*NL*
of
holy
religion
,
you
turned
your
back
on
the
confessional
,
you
*NL*
wallowed
deeper
and
deeper
in
the
mire
of
sin
.
God
appealed
to
you
,
*NL*
threatened
you
,
entreated
you
to
return
to
Him
.
O
,
what
shame
,
what
*NL*
misery
!
The
Ruler
of
the
universe
entreated
you
,
a
creature
of
clay
,
to
*NL*
love
Him
Who
made
you
and
to
keep
His
law
.
No
.
You
would
not
.
And
now
,
*NL*
though
you
were
to
flood
all
hell
with
your
tears
if
you
could
still
*NL*
weep
,
all
that
sea
of
repentance
would
not
gain
for
you
what
a
single
*NL*
tear
of
true
repentance
shed
during
your
mortal
life
would
have
gained
*NL*
for
you
.
You
implore
now
a
moment
of
earthly
life
wherein
to
repent
:
in
*NL*
vain
.
That
time
is
gone
:
gone
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Such
is
the
threefold
sting
of
conscience
,
the
viper
which
gnaws
the
*NL*
very
heart
's
core
of
the
wretches
in
hell
,
so
that
filled
with
hellish
*NL*
fury
they
curse
themselves
for
their
folly
and
curse
the
evil
*NL*
companions
who
have
brought
them
to
such
ruin
and
curse
the
devils
who
*NL*
tempted
them
in
life
and
now
mock
them
in
eternity
and
even
revile
and
*NL*
curse
the
Supreme
Being
Whose
goodness
and
patience
they
scorned
and
*NL*
slighted
but
Whose
justice
and
power
they
can
not
evade
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
next
spiritual
pain
to
which
the
damned
are
subjected
is
the
*NL*
pain
of
extension
.
Man
,
in
this
earthly
life
,
though
he
be
capable
of
*NL*
many
evils
,
is
not
capable
of
them
all
at
once
,
inasmuch
as
one
evil
*NL*
corrects
and
counteracts
another
just
as
one
poison
frequently
corrects
*NL*
another
.
In
hell
,
on
the
contrary
,
one
torment
,
instead
of
*NL*
counteracting
another
,
lends
it
still
greater
force
:
and
,
moreover
,
as
*NL*
the
internal
faculties
are
more
perfect
than
the
external
senses
,
so
*NL*
are
they
more
capable
of
suffering
.
Just
as
every
sense
is
afflicted
*NL*
with
a
fitting
torment
,
so
is
every
spiritual
faculty
;
the
fancy
with
*NL*
horrible
images
,
the
sensitive
faculty
with
alternate
longing
and
rage
,
*NL*
the
mind
and
understanding
with
an
interior
darkness
more
terrible
even
*NL*
than
the
exterior
darkness
which
reigns
in
that
dreadful
prison
.
The
*NL*
malice
,
impotent
though
it
be
,
which
possesses
these
demon
souls
is
an
*NL*
evil
of
boundless
extension
,
of
limitless
duration
,
a
frightful
state
*NL*
of
wickedness
which
we
can
scarcely
realize
unless
we
bear
in
mind
the
*NL*
enormity
of
sin
and
the
hatred
God
bears
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Opposed
to
this
pain
of
extension
and
yet
coexistent
with
it
we
have
*NL*
the
pain
of
intensity
.
Hell
is
the
centre
of
evils
and
,
as
you
know
,
*NL*
things
are
more
intense
at
their
centres
than
at
their
remotest
points
.
*NL*
There
are
no
contraries
or
admixtures
of
any
kind
to
temper
or
soften
*NL*
in
the
least
the
pains
of
hell
.
Nay
,
things
which
are
good
in
*NL*
themselves
become
evil
in
hell
.
Company
,
elsewhere
a
source
of
comfort
*NL*
to
the
afflicted
,
will
be
there
a
continual
torment
:
knowledge
,
so
much
*NL*
longed
for
as
the
chief
good
of
the
intellect
,
will
there
be
hated
*NL*
worse
than
ignorance
:
light
,
so
much
coveted
by
all
creatures
from
the
*NL*
lord
of
creation
down
to
the
humblest
plant
in
the
forest
,
will
be
*NL*
loathed
intensely
.
In
this
life
our
sorrows
are
either
not
very
long
or
*NL*
not
very
great
because
nature
either
overcomes
them
by
habits
or
puts
*NL*
an
end
to
them
by
sinking
under
their
weight
.
But
in
hell
the
torments
*NL*
can
not
be
overcome
by
habit
,
for
while
they
are
of
terrible
intensity
*NL*
they
are
at
the
same
time
of
continual
variety
,
each
pain
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
taking
fire
from
another
and
re-endowing
that
which
has
enkindled
it
*NL*
with
a
still
fiercer
flame
.
Nor
can
nature
escape
from
these
intense
*NL*
and
various
tortures
by
succumbing
to
them
for
the
soul
is
sustained
*NL*
and
maintained
in
evil
so
that
its
suffering
may
be
the
greater
.
*NL*
Boundless
extension
of
torment
,
incredible
intensity
of
suffering
,
*NL*
unceasing
variety
of
torture
--
this
is
what
the
divine
majesty
,
so
*NL*
outraged
by
sinners
,
demands
;
this
is
what
the
holiness
of
heaven
,
*NL*
slighted
and
set
aside
for
the
lustful
and
low
pleasures
of
the
corrupt
*NL*
flesh
,
requires
;
this
is
what
the
blood
of
the
innocent
Lamb
of
God
,
*NL*
shed
for
the
redemption
of
sinners
,
trampled
upon
by
the
vilest
of
the
*NL*
vile
,
insists
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Last
and
crowning
torture
of
all
the
tortures
of
that
awful
place
is
*NL*
the
eternity
of
hell
.
Eternity
!
O
,
dread
and
dire
word
.
Eternity
!
What
*NL*
mind
of
man
can
understand
it
?
And
remember
,
it
is
an
eternity
of
pain
.
*NL*
Even
though
the
pains
of
hell
were
not
so
terrible
as
they
are
,
yet
*NL*
they
would
become
infinite
,
as
they
are
destined
to
last
for
ever
.
But
*NL*
while
they
are
everlasting
they
are
at
the
same
time
,
as
you
know
,
*NL*
intolerably
intense
,
unbearably
extensive
.
To
bear
even
the
sting
of
an
*NL*
insect
for
all
eternity
would
be
a
dreadful
torment
.
What
must
it
be
,
*NL*
then
,
to
bear
the
manifold
tortures
of
hell
for
ever
?
For
ever
!
For
all
*NL*
eternity
!
Not
for
a
year
or
for
an
age
but
for
ever
.
Try
to
imagine
the
*NL*
awful
meaning
of
this
.
You
have
often
seen
the
sand
on
the
seashore
.
*NL*
How
fine
are
its
tiny
grains
!
And
how
many
of
those
tiny
little
grains
*NL*
go
to
make
up
the
small
handful
which
a
child
grasps
in
its
play
.
Now
*NL*
imagine
a
mountain
of
that
sand
,
a
million
miles
high
,
reaching
from
*NL*
the
earth
to
the
farthest
heavens
,
and
a
million
miles
broad
,
*NL*
extending
to
remotest
space
,
and
a
million
miles
in
thickness
;
*NL*
and
imagine
such
an
enormous
mass
of
countless
particles
of
sand
*NL*
multiplied
as
often
as
there
are
leaves
in
the
forest
,
drops
of
water
*NL*
in
the
mighty
ocean
,
feathers
on
birds
,
scales
on
fish
,
hairs
on
*NL*
animals
,
atoms
in
the
vast
expanse
of
the
air
:
and
imagine
that
at
the
*NL*
end
of
every
million
years
a
little
bird
came
to
that
mountain
and
*NL*
carried
away
in
its
beak
a
tiny
grain
of
that
sand
.
How
many
millions
*NL*
upon
millions
of
centuries
would
pass
before
that
bird
had
carried
away
*NL*
even
a
square
foot
of
that
mountain
,
how
many
eons
upon
eons
of
ages
*NL*
before
it
had
carried
away
all
?
Yet
at
the
end
of
that
immense
stretch
*NL*
of
time
not
even
one
instant
of
eternity
could
be
said
to
have
ended
.
*NL*
At
the
end
of
all
those
billions
and
trillions
of
years
eternity
would
*NL*
have
scarcely
begun
.
And
if
that
mountain
rose
again
after
it
had
been
*NL*
all
carried
away
,
and
if
the
bird
came
again
and
carried
it
all
away
*NL*
again
grain
by
grain
,
and
if
it
so
rose
and
sank
as
many
times
as
there
*NL*
are
stars
in
the
sky
,
atoms
in
the
air
,
drops
of
water
in
the
sea
,
*NL*
leaves
on
the
trees
,
feathers
upon
birds
,
scales
upon
fish
,
hairs
upon
*NL*
animals
,
at
the
end
of
all
those
innumerable
risings
and
sinkings
of
*NL*
that
immeasurably
vast
mountain
not
one
single
instant
of
eternity
*NL*
could
be
said
to
have
ended
;
even
then
,
at
the
end
of
such
a
period
,
*NL*
after
that
eon
of
time
the
mere
thought
of
which
makes
our
very
brain
*NL*
reel
dizzily
,
eternity
would
scarcely
have
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
holy
saint
-LRB-
one
of
our
own
fathers
I
believe
it
was
-RRB-
was
once
*NL*
vouchsafed
a
vision
of
hell
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
stood
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
a
great
hall
,
dark
and
silent
save
for
the
ticking
of
a
great
*NL*
clock
.
The
ticking
went
on
unceasingly
;
and
it
seemed
to
this
saint
*NL*
that
the
sound
of
the
ticking
was
the
ceaseless
repetition
of
the
*NL*
words
--
ever
,
never
;
ever
,
never
.
Ever
to
be
in
hell
,
never
to
be
in
heaven
;
*NL*
ever
to
be
shut
off
from
the
presence
of
God
,
never
to
enjoy
the
*NL*
beatific
vision
;
ever
to
be
eaten
with
flames
,
gnawed
by
vermin
,
goaded
*NL*
with
burning
spikes
,
never
to
be
free
from
those
pains
;
ever
to
have
*NL*
the
conscience
upbraid
one
,
the
memory
enrage
,
the
mind
filled
with
*NL*
darkness
and
despair
,
never
to
escape
;
ever
to
curse
and
revile
the
*NL*
foul
demons
who
gloat
fiendishly
over
the
misery
of
their
dupes
,
never
*NL*
to
behold
the
shining
raiment
of
the
blessed
spirits
;
ever
to
cry
out
*NL*
of
the
abyss
of
fire
to
God
for
an
instant
,
a
single
instant
,
of
*NL*
respite
from
such
awful
agony
,
never
to
receive
,
even
for
an
instant
,
*NL*
God
's
pardon
;
ever
to
suffer
,
never
to
enjoy
;
ever
to
be
damned
,
never
*NL*
to
be
saved
;
ever
,
never
;
ever
,
never
.
O
,
what
a
dreadful
punishment
!
*NL*
An
eternity
of
endless
agony
,
of
endless
bodily
and
spiritual
torment
,
*NL*
without
one
ray
of
hope
,
without
one
moment
of
cessation
,
of
agony
*NL*
limitless
in
intensity
,
of
torment
infinitely
varied
,
of
torture
that
*NL*
sustains
eternally
that
which
it
eternally
devours
,
of
anguish
that
*NL*
everlastingly
preys
upon
the
spirit
while
it
racks
the
flesh
,
an
*NL*
eternity
,
every
instant
of
which
is
itself
an
eternity
of
woe
.
Such
is
*NL*
the
terrible
punishment
decreed
for
those
who
die
in
mortal
sin
by
an
*NL*
almighty
and
a
just
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
a
just
God
!
Men
,
reasoning
always
as
men
,
are
astonished
that
*NL*
God
should
mete
out
an
everlasting
and
infinite
punishment
in
the
fires
*NL*
of
hell
for
a
single
grievous
sin
.
They
reason
thus
because
,
blinded
by
*NL*
the
gross
illusion
of
the
flesh
and
the
darkness
of
human
*NL*
understanding
,
they
are
unable
to
comprehend
the
hideous
malice
of
*NL*
mortal
sin
.
They
reason
thus
because
they
are
unable
to
comprehend
that
*NL*
even
venial
sin
is
of
such
a
foul
and
hideous
nature
that
even
if
the
*NL*
omnipotent
Creator
could
end
all
the
evil
and
misery
in
the
world
,
the
*NL*
wars
,
the
diseases
,
the
robberies
,
the
crimes
,
the
deaths
,
the
murders
,
*NL*
on
condition
that
he
allowed
a
single
venial
sin
to
pass
unpunished
,
a
*NL*
single
venial
sin
,
a
lie
,
an
angry
look
,
a
moment
of
wilful
sloth
,
He
,
*NL*
the
great
omnipotent
God
could
not
do
so
because
sin
,
be
it
in
thought
*NL*
or
deed
,
is
a
transgression
of
His
law
and
God
would
not
be
God
if
He
*NL*
did
not
punish
the
transgressor
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
sin
,
an
instant
of
rebellious
pride
of
the
intellect
,
made
Lucifer
*NL*
and
a
third
part
of
the
cohort
of
angels
fall
from
their
glory
.
A
sin
,
*NL*
an
instant
of
folly
and
weakness
,
drove
Adam
and
Eve
out
of
Eden
and
*NL*
brought
death
and
suffering
into
the
world
.
To
retrieve
the
*NL*
consequences
of
that
sin
the
Only
Begotten
Son
of
God
came
down
to
*NL*
earth
,
lived
and
suffered
and
died
a
most
painful
death
,
hanging
for
*NL*
three
hours
on
the
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
my
dear
little
brethren
in
Christ
Jesus
,
will
we
then
offend
that
*NL*
good
Redeemer
and
provoke
His
anger
?
Will
we
trample
again
upon
that
*NL*
torn
and
mangled
corpse
?
Will
we
spit
upon
that
face
so
full
of
sorrow
*NL*
and
love
?
Will
we
too
,
like
the
cruel
jews
and
the
brutal
soldiers
,
*NL*
mock
that
gentle
and
compassionate
Saviour
Who
trod
alone
for
our
sake
*NL*
the
awful
wine-press
of
sorrow
?
Every
word
of
sin
is
a
wound
in
His
*NL*
tender
side
.
Every
sinful
act
is
a
thorn
piercing
His
head
.
Every
*NL*
impure
thought
,
deliberately
yielded
to
,
is
a
keen
lance
transfixing
that
*NL*
sacred
and
loving
heart
.
No
,
no
.
It
is
impossible
for
any
human
being
to
*NL*
do
that
which
offends
so
deeply
the
divine
majesty
,
that
which
is
punished
*NL*
by
an
eternity
of
agony
,
that
which
crucifies
again
the
Son
of
God
and
*NL*
makes
a
mockery
of
Him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
pray
to
God
that
my
poor
words
may
have
availed
today
to
confirm
*NL*
in
holiness
those
who
are
in
a
state
of
grace
,
to
strengthen
the
*NL*
wavering
,
to
lead
back
to
the
state
of
grace
the
poor
soul
that
has
*NL*
strayed
if
any
such
be
among
you
.
I
pray
to
God
,
and
do
you
pray
with
*NL*
me
,
that
we
may
repent
of
our
sins
.
I
will
ask
you
now
,
all
of
you
,
to
*NL*
repeat
after
me
the
act
of
contrition
,
kneeling
here
in
this
humble
*NL*
chapel
in
the
presence
of
God
.
He
is
there
in
the
tabernacle
burning
*NL*
with
love
for
mankind
,
ready
to
comfort
the
afflicted
.
Be
not
afraid
.
*NL*
No
matter
how
many
or
how
foul
the
sins
if
you
only
repent
of
them
they
*NL*
will
be
forgiven
you
.
Let
no
worldly
shame
hold
you
back
.
God
is
still
*NL*
the
merciful
Lord
who
wishes
not
the
eternal
death
of
the
sinner
but
*NL*
rather
that
he
be
converted
and
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
calls
you
to
Him
.
You
are
His
.
He
made
you
out
of
nothing
.
He
*NL*
loved
you
as
only
a
God
can
love
.
His
arms
are
open
to
receive
you
even
*NL*
though
you
have
sinned
against
Him
.
Come
to
Him
,
poor
sinner
,
poor
vain
*NL*
and
erring
sinner
.
Now
is
the
acceptable
time
.
Now
is
the
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
rose
and
,
turning
towards
the
altar
,
knelt
upon
the
step
*NL*
before
the
tabernacle
in
the
fallen
gloom
.
He
waited
till
all
in
the
*NL*
chapel
had
knelt
and
every
least
noise
was
still
.
Then
,
raising
his
*NL*
head
,
he
repeated
the
act
of
contrition
,
phrase
by
phrase
,
with
*NL*
fervour
.
The
boys
answered
him
phrase
by
phrase
.
Stephen
,
his
tongue
*NL*
cleaving
to
his
palate
,
bowed
his
head
,
praying
with
his
heart
.

He
went
up
to
his
room
after
dinner
in
order
to
be
alone
with
his
soul
,
*NL*
and
at
every
step
his
soul
seemed
to
sigh
;
at
every
step
his
soul
*NL*
mounted
with
his
feet
,
sighing
in
the
ascent
,
through
a
region
of
*NL*
viscid
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
halted
on
the
landing
before
the
door
and
then
,
grasping
the
*NL*
porcelain
knob
,
opened
the
door
quickly
.
He
waited
in
fear
,
his
soul
*NL*
pining
within
him
,
praying
silently
that
death
might
not
touch
his
brow
*NL*
as
he
passed
over
the
threshold
,
that
the
fiends
that
inhabit
darkness
*NL*
might
not
be
given
power
over
him
.
He
waited
still
at
the
threshold
as
*NL*
at
the
entrance
to
some
dark
cave
.
Faces
were
there
;
eyes
:
they
waited
*NL*
and
watched
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
knew
perfectly
well
of
course
that
though
it
was
bound
to
come
to
*NL*
the
light
he
would
find
considerable
difficulty
in
endeavouring
to
try
*NL*
to
induce
himself
to
try
to
endeavour
to
ascertain
the
spiritual
*NL*
plenipotentiary
and
so
we
knew
of
course
perfectly
well
--
*NL*
*NL*
Murmuring
faces
waited
and
watched
;
murmurous
voices
filled
the
dark
*NL*
shell
of
the
cave
.
He
feared
intensely
in
spirit
and
in
flesh
but
,
*NL*
raising
his
head
bravely
,
he
strode
into
the
room
firmly
.
A
doorway
,
a
*NL*
room
,
the
same
room
,
same
window
.
He
told
himself
calmly
that
those
*NL*
words
had
absolutely
no
sense
which
had
seemed
to
rise
murmurously
from
*NL*
the
dark
.
He
told
himself
that
it
was
simply
his
room
with
the
door
*NL*
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
the
door
and
,
walking
swiftly
to
the
bed
,
knelt
beside
it
and
*NL*
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
.
His
hands
were
cold
and
damp
and
his
*NL*
limbs
ached
with
chill
.
Bodily
unrest
and
chill
and
weariness
beset
*NL*
him
,
routing
his
thoughts
.
Why
was
he
kneeling
there
like
a
child
*NL*
saying
his
evening
prayers
?
To
be
alone
with
his
soul
,
to
examine
his
*NL*
conscience
,
to
meet
his
sins
face
to
face
,
to
recall
their
times
and
*NL*
manners
and
circumstances
,
to
weep
over
them
.
He
could
not
weep
.
He
*NL*
could
not
summon
them
to
his
memory
.
He
felt
only
an
ache
of
soul
and
*NL*
body
,
his
whole
being
,
memory
,
will
,
understanding
,
flesh
,
benumbed
*NL*
and
weary
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
work
of
devils
,
to
scatter
his
thoughts
and
over-cloud
his
*NL*
conscience
,
assailing
him
at
the
gates
of
the
cowardly
and
*NL*
sin-corrupted
flesh
:
and
,
praying
God
timidly
to
forgive
him
his
*NL*
weakness
,
he
crawled
up
on
to
the
bed
and
,
wrapping
the
blankets
*NL*
closely
about
him
,
covered
his
face
again
with
his
hands
.
He
had
*NL*
sinned
.
He
had
sinned
so
deeply
against
heaven
and
before
God
that
he
*NL*
was
not
worthy
to
be
called
God
's
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Could
it
be
that
he
,
Stephen
Dedalus
,
had
done
those
things
?
His
*NL*
conscience
sighed
in
answer
.
Yes
,
he
had
done
them
,
secretly
,
filthily
,
*NL*
time
after
time
,
and
,
hardened
in
sinful
impenitence
,
he
had
dared
to
*NL*
wear
the
mask
of
holiness
before
the
tabernacle
itself
while
his
soul
*NL*
within
was
a
living
mass
of
corruption
.
How
came
it
that
God
had
not
*NL*
struck
him
dead
?
The
leprous
company
of
his
sins
closed
about
him
,
*NL*
breathing
upon
him
,
bending
over
him
from
all
sides
.
He
strove
to
*NL*
forget
them
in
an
act
of
prayer
,
huddling
his
limbs
closer
together
and
*NL*
binding
down
his
eyelids
:
but
the
senses
of
his
soul
would
not
be
bound
*NL*
and
,
though
his
eyes
were
shut
fast
,
he
saw
the
places
where
he
had
*NL*
sinned
and
,
though
his
ears
were
tightly
covered
,
he
heard
.
He
desired
*NL*
with
all
his
will
not
to
hear
or
see
.
He
desired
till
his
frame
shook
*NL*
under
the
strain
of
his
desire
and
until
the
senses
of
his
soul
closed
.
*NL*
They
closed
for
an
instant
and
then
opened
.
He
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
field
of
stiff
weeds
and
thistles
and
tufted
nettle-bunches
.
Thick
*NL*
among
the
tufts
of
rank
stiff
growth
lay
battered
canisters
and
clots
*NL*
and
coils
of
solid
excrement
.
A
faint
marshlight
struggling
upwards
*NL*
from
all
the
ordure
through
the
bristling
grey-green
weeds
.
An
evil
*NL*
smell
,
faint
and
foul
as
the
light
,
curled
upwards
sluggishly
out
of
*NL*
the
canisters
and
from
the
stale
crusted
dung
.
*NL*
*NL*
Creatures
were
in
the
field
:
one
,
three
,
six
:
creatures
were
moving
in
*NL*
the
field
,
hither
and
thither
.
Goatish
creatures
with
human
faces
,
*NL*
hornybrowed
,
lightly
bearded
and
grey
as
india-rubber
.
The
malice
of
*NL*
evil
glittered
in
their
hard
eyes
,
as
they
moved
hither
and
thither
,
*NL*
trailing
their
long
tails
behind
them
.
A
rictus
of
cruel
malignity
lit
*NL*
up
greyly
their
old
bony
faces
.
One
was
clasping
about
his
ribs
a
torn
*NL*
flannel
waistcoat
,
another
complained
monotonously
as
his
beard
stuck
*NL*
in
the
tufted
weeds
.
Soft
language
issued
from
their
spittleless
lips
*NL*
as
they
swished
in
slow
circles
round
and
round
the
field
,
winding
*NL*
hither
and
thither
through
the
weeds
,
dragging
their
long
tails
amid
*NL*
the
rattling
canisters
.
They
moved
in
slow
circles
,
circling
closer
and
*NL*
closer
to
enclose
,
to
enclose
,
soft
language
issuing
from
their
lips
,
*NL*
their
long
swishing
tails
besmeared
with
stale
shite
,
thrusting
upwards
*NL*
their
terrific
faces
...
*NL*
*NL*
Help
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
flung
the
blankets
from
him
madly
to
free
his
face
and
neck
.
That
*NL*
was
his
hell
.
God
had
allowed
him
to
see
the
hell
reserved
for
his
*NL*
sins
:
stinking
,
bestial
,
malignant
,
a
hell
of
lecherous
goatish
fiends
.
*NL*
For
him
!
For
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
sprang
from
the
bed
,
the
reeking
odour
pouring
down
his
throat
,
*NL*
clogging
and
revolting
his
entrails
.
Air
!
The
air
of
heaven
!
He
*NL*
stumbled
towards
the
window
,
groaning
and
almost
fainting
with
*NL*
sickness
.
At
the
washstand
a
convulsion
seized
him
within
;
and
,
*NL*
clasping
his
cold
forehead
wildly
,
he
vomited
profusely
in
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
fit
had
spent
itself
he
walked
weakly
to
the
window
and
,
*NL*
lifting
the
sash
,
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
embrasure
and
leaned
his
elbow
*NL*
upon
the
sill
.
The
rain
had
drawn
off
;
and
amid
the
moving
vapours
from
*NL*
point
to
point
of
light
the
city
was
spinning
about
herself
a
soft
*NL*
cocoon
of
yellowish
haze
.
Heaven
was
still
and
faintly
luminous
and
the
*NL*
air
sweet
to
breathe
,
as
in
a
thicket
drenched
with
showers
;
and
amid
*NL*
peace
and
shimmering
lights
and
quiet
fragrance
he
made
a
covenant
with
*NL*
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
prayed
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
--
HE
ONCE
HAD
MEANT
TO
COME
ON
EARTH
IN
HEAVENLY
GLORY
BUT
WE
SINNED
;
AND
*NL*
THEN
HE
COULD
NOT
SAFELY
VISIT
US
BUT
WITH
A
SHROUDED
MAJESTY
AND
A
*NL*
BEDIMMED
RADIANCE
FOR
HE
WAS
GOD
.
SO
HE
CAME
HIMSELF
IN
WEAKNESS
NOT
IN
*NL*
POWER
AND
HE
SENT
THEE
,
A
CREATURE
IN
HIS
STEAD
,
WITH
A
CREATURE
'S
*NL*
COMELINESS
AND
LUSTRE
SUITED
TO
OUR
STATE
.
AND
NOW
THY
VERY
FACE
AND
*NL*
FORM
,
DEAR
MOTHER
SPEAK
TO
US
OF
THE
ETERNAL
NOT
LIKE
EARTHLY
BEAUTY
,
*NL*
DANGEROUS
TO
LOOK
UPON
,
BUT
LIKE
THE
MORNING
STAR
WHICH
IS
THY
EMBLEM
,
*NL*
BRIGHT
AND
MUSICAL
,
BREATHING
PURITY
,
TELLING
OF
HEAVEN
AND
INFUSING
*NL*
PEACE
.
O
HARBINGER
OF
DAY
!
O
LIGHT
OF
THE
PILGRIM
!
LEAD

STILL
AS
*NL*
THOU
HAST

IN

DARK
NIGHT

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
were
dimmed
with
tears
and
,
looking
humbly
up
to
heaven
,
he
*NL*
wept
for
the
innocence
he
had
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
evening
had
fallen
he
left
the
house
,
and
the
first
touch
of
the
*NL*
damp
dark
air
and
the
noise
of
the
door
as
it
closed
behind
him
made
*NL*
ache
again
his
conscience
,
lulled
by
prayer
and
tears
.
Confess
!
*NL*
Confess
!
It
was
not
enough
to
lull
the
conscience
with
a
tear
and
a
*NL*
prayer
.
He
had
to
kneel
before
the
minister
of
the
Holy
Ghost
and
tell
*NL*
over
his
hidden
sins
truly
and
repentantly
.
Before
he
heard
again
the
*NL*
footboard
of
the
housedoor
trail
over
the
threshold
as
it
opened
to
let
*NL*
him
in
,
before
he
saw
again
the
table
in
the
kitchen
set
for
supper
he
*NL*
would
have
knelt
and
confessed
.
It
was
quite
simple
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ache
of
conscience
ceased
and
he
walked
onward
swiftly
through
the
*NL*
dark
streets
.
There
were
so
many
flagstones
on
the
footpath
of
that
*NL*
street
and
so
many
streets
in
that
city
and
so
many
cities
in
the
*NL*
world
.
Yet
eternity
had
no
end
.
He
was
in
mortal
sin
.
Even
once
was
a
*NL*
mortal
sin
.
It
could
happen
in
an
instant
.
But
how
so
quickly
?
By
*NL*
seeing
or
by
thinking
of
seeing
.
The
eyes
see
the
thing
,
without
having
*NL*
wished
first
to
see
.
Then
in
an
instant
it
happens
.
But
does
that
part
*NL*
of
the
body
understand
or
what
?
The
serpent
,
the
most
subtle
beast
of
*NL*
the
field
.
It
must
understand
when
it
desires
in
one
instant
and
then
*NL*
prolongs
its
own
desire
instant
after
instant
,
sinfully
.
It
feels
and
*NL*
understands
and
desires
.
What
a
horrible
thing
!
Who
made
it
to
be
like
*NL*
that
,
a
bestial
part
of
the
body
able
to
understand
bestially
and
*NL*
desire
bestially
?
Was
that
then
he
or
an
inhuman
thing
moved
by
a
lower
*NL*
soul
?
His
soul
sickened
at
the
thought
of
a
torpid
snaky
life
feeding
*NL*
itself
out
of
the
tender
marrow
of
his
life
and
fattening
upon
the
*NL*
slime
of
lust
.
O
why
was
that
so
?
O
why
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
cowered
in
the
shadow
of
the
thought
,
abasing
himself
in
the
awe
of
*NL*
God
Who
had
made
all
things
and
all
men
.
Madness
.
Who
could
think
such
*NL*
a
thought
?
And
,
cowering
in
darkness
and
abject
,
he
prayed
mutely
to
*NL*
his
guardian
angel
to
drive
away
with
his
sword
the
demon
that
was
*NL*
whispering
to
his
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whisper
ceased
and
he
knew
then
clearly
that
his
own
soul
had
*NL*
sinned
in
thought
and
word
and
deed
wilfully
through
his
own
body
.
*NL*
Confess
!
He
had
to
confess
every
sin
.
How
could
he
utter
in
words
to
*NL*
the
priest
what
he
had
done
?
Must
,
must
.
Or
how
could
he
explain
*NL*
without
dying
of
shame
?
Or
how
could
he
have
done
such
things
without
*NL*
shame
?
A
madman
!
Confess
!
O
he
would
indeed
to
be
free
and
sinless
*NL*
again
!
Perhaps
the
priest
would
know
.
O
dear
God
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
and
on
through
ill-lit
streets
,
fearing
to
stand
still
for
*NL*
a
moment
lest
it
might
seem
that
he
held
back
from
what
awaited
him
,
*NL*
fearing
to
arrive
at
that
towards
which
he
still
turned
with
longing
.
*NL*
How
beautiful
must
be
a
soul
in
the
state
of
grace
when
God
looked
upon
*NL*
it
with
love
!
*NL*
*NL*
Frowsy
girls
sat
along
the
curbstones
before
their
baskets
.
Their
dank
*NL*
hair
hung
trailed
over
their
brows
.
They
were
not
beautiful
to
see
as
*NL*
they
crouched
in
the
mire
.
But
their
souls
were
seen
by
God
;
and
if
*NL*
their
souls
were
in
a
state
of
grace
they
were
radiant
to
see
:
and
God
*NL*
loved
them
,
seeing
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
wasting
breath
of
humiliation
blew
bleakly
over
his
soul
to
think
of
*NL*
how
he
had
fallen
,
to
feel
that
those
souls
were
dearer
to
God
than
*NL*
his
.
The
wind
blew
over
him
and
passed
on
to
the
myriads
and
myriads
of
*NL*
other
souls
on
whom
God
's
favour
shone
now
more
and
now
less
,
stars
now
*NL*
brighter
and
now
dimmer
sustained
and
failing
.
And
the
glimmering
souls
*NL*
passed
away
,
sustained
and
failing
,
merged
in
a
moving
breath
.
*NL*
One
soul
was
lost
;
a
tiny
soul
:
his
.
It
flickered
once
and
went
*NL*
out
,
forgotten
,
lost
.
The
end
:
black
,
cold
,
void
waste
.
*NL*
*NL*
Consciousness
of
place
came
ebbing
back
to
him
slowly
over
a
vast
tract
*NL*
of
time
unlit
,
unfelt
,
unlived
.
The
squalid
scene
composed
itself
*NL*
around
him
;
the
common
accents
,
the
burning
gas-jets
in
the
shops
,
*NL*
odours
of
fish
and
spirits
and
wet
sawdust
,
moving
men
and
women
.
An
*NL*
old
woman
was
about
to
cross
the
street
,
an
oilcan
in
her
hand
.
He
bent
*NL*
down
and
asked
her
was
there
a
chapel
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
chapel
,
sir
?
Yes
,
sir
.
Church
Street
chapel
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Church
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
shifted
the
can
to
her
other
hand
and
directed
him
;
and
,
as
she
*NL*
held
out
her
reeking
withered
right
hand
under
its
fringe
of
shawl
,
he
*NL*
bent
lower
towards
her
,
saddened
and
soothed
by
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thank
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
are
quite
welcome
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
candles
on
the
high
altar
had
been
extinguished
but
the
fragrance
*NL*
of
incense
still
floated
down
the
dim
nave
.
Bearded
workmen
with
pious
*NL*
faces
were
guiding
a
canopy
out
through
a
side
door
,
the
sacristan
*NL*
aiding
them
with
quiet
gestures
and
words
.
A
few
of
the
faithful
still
*NL*
lingered
praying
before
one
of
the
side-altars
or
kneeling
in
the
*NL*
benches
near
the
confessionals
.
He
approached
timidly
and
knelt
at
the
*NL*
last
bench
in
the
body
,
thankful
for
the
peace
and
silence
and
fragrant
*NL*
shadow
of
the
church
.
The
board
on
which
he
knelt
was
narrow
and
worn
*NL*
and
those
who
knelt
near
him
were
humble
followers
of
Jesus
.
Jesus
too
*NL*
had
been
born
in
poverty
and
had
worked
in
the
shop
of
a
carpenter
,
*NL*
cutting
boards
and
planing
them
,
and
had
first
spoken
of
the
kingdom
of
*NL*
God
to
poor
fishermen
,
teaching
all
men
to
be
meek
and
humble
of
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hands
,
bidding
his
heart
be
meek
and
humble
*NL*
that
he
might
be
like
those
who
knelt
beside
him
and
his
prayer
as
*NL*
acceptable
as
theirs
.
He
prayed
beside
them
but
it
was
hard
.
His
soul
*NL*
was
foul
with
sin
and
he
dared
not
ask
forgiveness
with
the
simple
*NL*
trust
of
those
whom
Jesus
,
in
the
mysterious
ways
of
God
,
had
called
*NL*
first
to
His
side
,
the
carpenters
,
the
fishermen
,
poor
and
simple
*NL*
people
following
a
lowly
trade
,
handling
and
shaping
the
wood
of
trees
,
*NL*
mending
their
nets
with
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tall
figure
came
down
the
aisle
and
the
penitents
stirred
;
and
at
the
*NL*
last
moment
,
glancing
up
swiftly
,
he
saw
a
long
grey
beard
and
the
*NL*
brown
habit
of
a
capuchin
.
The
priest
entered
the
box
and
was
hidden
.
*NL*
Two
penitents
rose
and
entered
the
confessional
at
either
side
.
The
*NL*
wooden
slide
was
drawn
back
and
the
faint
murmur
of
a
voice
troubled
*NL*
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
blood
began
to
murmur
in
his
veins
,
murmuring
like
a
sinful
city
*NL*
summoned
from
its
sleep
to
hear
its
doom
.
Little
flakes
of
fire
fell
*NL*
and
powdery
ashes
fell
softly
,
alighting
on
the
houses
of
men
.
They
*NL*
stirred
,
waking
from
sleep
,
troubled
by
the
heated
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slide
was
shot
back
.
The
penitent
emerged
from
the
side
of
the
box
.
*NL*
The
farther
side
was
drawn
.
A
woman
entered
quietly
and
deftly
where
*NL*
the
first
penitent
had
knelt
.
The
faint
murmur
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
still
leave
the
chapel
.
He
could
stand
up
,
put
one
foot
before
*NL*
the
other
and
walk
out
softly
and
then
run
,
run
,
run
swiftly
through
*NL*
the
dark
streets
.
He
could
still
escape
from
the
shame
.
Had
it
been
any
*NL*
terrible
crime
but
that
one
sin
!
Had
it
been
murder
!
Little
fiery
*NL*
flakes
fell
and
touched
him
at
all
points
,
shameful
thoughts
,
shameful
*NL*
words
,
shameful
acts
.
Shame
covered
him
wholly
like
fine
glowing
ashes
*NL*
falling
continually
.
To
say
it
in
words
!
His
soul
,
stifling
and
*NL*
helpless
,
would
cease
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slide
was
shot
back
.
A
penitent
emerged
from
the
farther
side
of
*NL*
the
box
.
The
near
slide
was
drawn
.
A
penitent
entered
where
the
other
*NL*
penitent
had
come
out
.
A
soft
whispering
noise
floated
in
vaporous
*NL*
cloudlets
out
of
the
box
.
It
was
the
woman
:
soft
whispering
cloudlets
,
*NL*
soft
whispering
vapour
,
whispering
and
vanishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
beat
his
breast
with
his
fist
humbly
,
secretly
under
cover
of
the
*NL*
wooden
armrest
.
He
would
be
at
one
with
others
and
with
God
.
He
would
*NL*
love
his
neighbour
.
He
would
love
God
who
had
made
and
loved
him
.
He
*NL*
would
kneel
and
pray
with
others
and
be
happy
.
God
would
look
down
on
*NL*
him
and
on
them
and
would
love
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
to
be
good
.
God
's
yoke
was
sweet
and
light
.
It
was
better
*NL*
never
to
have
sinned
,
to
have
remained
always
a
child
,
for
God
loved
*NL*
little
children
and
suffered
them
to
come
to
Him
.
It
was
a
terrible
and
*NL*
a
sad
thing
to
sin
.
But
God
was
merciful
to
poor
sinners
who
were
truly
*NL*
sorry
.
How
true
that
was
!
That
was
indeed
goodness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slide
was
shot
to
suddenly
.
The
penitent
came
out
.
He
was
next
.
He
*NL*
stood
up
in
terror
and
walked
blindly
into
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
it
had
come
.
He
knelt
in
the
silent
gloom
and
raised
his
eyes
*NL*
to
the
white
crucifix
suspended
above
him
.
God
could
see
that
he
was
*NL*
sorry
.
He
would
tell
all
his
sins
.
His
confession
would
be
long
,
long
.
*NL*
Everybody
in
the
chapel
would
know
then
what
a
sinner
he
had
been
.
Let
*NL*
them
know
.
It
was
true
.
But
God
had
promised
to
forgive
him
if
he
was
*NL*
sorry
.
He
was
sorry
.
He
clasped
his
hands
and
raised
them
towards
the
*NL*
white
form
,
praying
with
his
darkened
eyes
,
praying
with
all
his
*NL*
trembling
body
,
swaying
his
head
to
and
fro
like
a
lost
creature
,
*NL*
praying
with
whimpering
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sorry
!
Sorry
!
O
sorry
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
slide
clicked
back
and
his
heart
bounded
in
his
breast
.
The
face
of
*NL*
an
old
priest
was
at
the
grating
,
averted
from
him
,
leaning
upon
a
*NL*
hand
.
He
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
prayed
of
the
priest
to
bless
*NL*
him
for
he
had
sinned
.
Then
,
bowing
his
head
,
he
repeated
the
CONFITEOR
*NL*
in
fright
.
At
the
words
MY
MOST
GRIEVOUS
FAULT
he
ceased
,
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
long
is
it
since
your
last
confession
,
my
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
long
time
,
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
month
,
my
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Longer
,
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Three
months
,
my
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Longer
,
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Six
months
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Eight
months
,
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
begun
.
The
priest
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
what
do
you
remember
since
that
time
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
confess
his
sins
:
masses
missed
,
prayers
not
said
,
lies
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Anything
else
,
my
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
Sins
of
anger
,
envy
of
others
,
gluttony
,
vanity
,
disobedience
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Anything
else
,
my
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
help
.
He
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I.
.
.
committed
sins
of
impurity
,
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
did
not
turn
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
With
yourself
,
my
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
...
with
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
With
women
,
my
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Were
they
married
women
,
my
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
.
His
sins
trickled
from
his
lips
,
one
by
one
,
trickled
*NL*
in
shameful
drops
from
his
soul
,
festering
and
oozing
like
a
sore
,
a
*NL*
squalid
stream
of
vice
.
The
last
sins
oozed
forth
,
sluggish
,
filthy
.
*NL*
There
was
no
more
to
tell
.
He
bowed
his
head
,
overcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Priest
was
silent
.
Then
he
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
old
are
you
,
my
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sixteen
,
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
passed
his
hand
several
times
over
his
face
.
Then
,
resting
*NL*
his
forehead
against
his
hand
,
he
leaned
towards
the
grating
and
,
with
*NL*
eyes
still
averted
,
spoke
slowly
.
His
voice
was
weary
and
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
are
very
young
,
my
child
,
he
said
,
and
let
me
implore
of
you
to
*NL*
give
up
that
sin
.
It
is
a
terrible
sin
.
It
kills
the
body
and
it
kills
*NL*
the
soul
.
It
is
the
cause
of
many
crimes
and
misfortunes
.
Give
it
up
,
*NL*
my
child
,
for
God
's
sake
.
It
is
dishonourable
and
unmanly
.
You
can
not
*NL*
know
where
that
wretched
habit
will
lead
you
or
where
it
will
come
*NL*
against
you
.
As
long
as
you
commit
that
sin
,
my
poor
child
,
you
will
*NL*
never
be
worth
one
farthing
to
God
.
Pray
to
our
mother
Mary
to
help
*NL*
you
.
She
will
help
you
,
my
child
.
Pray
to
Our
Blessed
Lady
when
that
*NL*
sin
comes
into
your
mind
.
I
am
sure
you
will
do
that
,
will
you
not
?
You
*NL*
repent
of
all
those
sins
.
I
am
sure
you
do
.
And
you
will
promise
God
*NL*
now
that
by
His
holy
grace
you
will
never
offend
Him
any
more
by
that
*NL*
wicked
sin
.
You
will
make
that
solemn
promise
to
God
,
will
you
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
and
weary
voice
fell
like
sweet
rain
upon
his
quaking
parching
*NL*
heart
.
How
sweet
and
sad
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
so
my
poor
child
.
The
devil
has
led
you
astray
.
Drive
him
back
to
*NL*
hell
when
he
tempts
you
to
dishonour
your
body
in
that
way
--
the
foul
*NL*
spirit
who
hates
our
Lord
.
Promise
God
now
that
you
will
give
up
that
*NL*
sin
,
that
wretched
wretched
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blinded
by
his
tears
and
by
the
light
of
God
's
mercifulness
he
bent
his
*NL*
head
and
heard
the
grave
words
of
absolution
spoken
and
saw
the
*NL*
priest
's
hand
raised
above
him
in
token
of
forgiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
bless
you
,
my
child
.
Pray
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knelt
to
say
his
penance
,
praying
in
a
corner
of
the
dark
nave
;
and
*NL*
his
prayers
ascended
to
heaven
from
his
purified
heart
like
perfume
*NL*
streaming
upwards
from
a
heart
of
white
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
muddy
streets
were
gay
.
He
strode
homeward
,
conscious
of
an
*NL*
invisible
grace
pervading
and
making
light
his
limbs
.
In
spite
of
all
*NL*
he
had
done
it
.
He
had
confessed
and
God
had
pardoned
him
.
His
soul
was
*NL*
made
fair
and
holy
once
more
,
holy
and
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
beautiful
to
die
if
God
so
willed
.
It
was
beautiful
to
live
*NL*
in
grace
a
life
of
peace
and
virtue
and
forbearance
with
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
by
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
,
not
daring
to
speak
for
happiness
.
*NL*
Till
that
moment
he
had
not
known
how
beautiful
and
peaceful
life
could
*NL*
be
.
The
green
square
of
paper
pinned
round
the
lamp
cast
down
a
tender
*NL*
shade
.
On
the
dresser
was
a
plate
of
sausages
and
white
pudding
and
on
*NL*
the
shelf
there
were
eggs
.
They
would
be
for
the
breakfast
in
the
*NL*
morning
after
the
communion
in
the
college
chapel
.
White
pudding
and
*NL*
eggs
and
sausages
and
cups
of
tea
.
How
simple
and
beautiful
was
life
*NL*
after
all
!
And
life
lay
all
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
dream
he
fell
asleep
.
In
a
dream
he
rose
and
saw
that
it
was
*NL*
morning
.
In
a
waking
dream
he
went
through
the
quiet
morning
towards
*NL*
the
college
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
were
all
there
,
kneeling
in
their
places
.
He
knelt
among
them
,
*NL*
happy
and
shy
.
The
altar
was
heaped
with
fragrant
masses
of
white
*NL*
flowers
;
and
in
the
morning
light
the
pale
flames
of
the
candles
among
*NL*
the
white
flowers
were
clear
and
silent
as
his
own
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knelt
before
the
altar
with
his
classmates
,
holding
the
altar
cloth
*NL*
with
them
over
a
living
rail
of
hands
.
His
hands
were
trembling
and
his
*NL*
soul
trembled
as
he
heard
the
priest
pass
with
the
ciborium
from
*NL*
communicant
to
communicant
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
CORPUS
DOMINI
NOSTRI
.
*NL*
*NL*
Could
it
be
?
He
knelt
there
sinless
and
timid
;
and
he
would
hold
upon
*NL*
his
tongue
the
host
and
God
would
enter
his
purified
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
IN
VITAM
ETERNAM
.
AMEN
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
life
!
A
life
of
grace
and
virtue
and
happiness
!
It
was
true
.
It
*NL*
was
not
a
dream
from
which
he
would
wake
.
The
past
was
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
CORPUS
DOMINI
NOSTRI
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ciborium
had
come
to
him
.

Chapter
4
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sunday
was
dedicated
to
the
mystery
of
the
Holy
Trinity
,
Monday
to
the
*NL*
Holy
Ghost
,
Tuesday
to
the
Guardian
Angels
,
Wednesday
to
saint
Joseph
,
*NL*
Thursday
to
the
Most
Blessed
Sacrament
of
the
Altar
,
Friday
to
the
*NL*
Suffering
Jesus
,
Saturday
to
the
Blessed
Virgin
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
he
hallowed
himself
anew
in
the
presence
of
some
holy
*NL*
image
or
mystery
.
His
day
began
with
an
heroic
offering
of
its
every
*NL*
moment
of
thought
or
action
for
the
intentions
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
*NL*
and
with
an
early
mass
.
The
raw
morning
air
whetted
his
resolute
piety
;
*NL*
and
often
as
he
knelt
among
the
few
worshippers
at
the
side-altar
,
*NL*
following
with
his
interleaved
prayer-book
the
murmur
of
the
priest
,
he
*NL*
glanced
up
for
an
instant
towards
the
vested
figure
standing
in
the
*NL*
gloom
between
the
two
candles
,
which
were
the
old
and
the
new
*NL*
testaments
,
and
imagined
that
he
was
kneeling
at
mass
in
the
catacombs
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
daily
life
was
laid
out
in
devotional
areas
.
By
means
of
*NL*
ejaculations
and
prayers
he
stored
up
ungrudgingly
for
the
souls
in
*NL*
purgatory
centuries
of
days
and
quarantines
and
years
;
yet
the
*NL*
spiritual
triumph
which
he
felt
in
achieving
with
ease
so
many
fabulous
*NL*
ages
of
canonical
penances
did
not
wholly
reward
his
zeal
of
prayer
,
*NL*
since
he
could
never
know
how
much
temporal
punishment
he
had
remitted
*NL*
by
way
of
suffrage
for
the
agonizing
souls
;
and
fearful
lest
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
purgatorial
fire
,
which
differed
from
the
infernal
only
in
*NL*
that
it
was
not
everlasting
,
his
penance
might
avail
no
more
than
a
*NL*
drop
of
moisture
,
he
drove
his
soul
daily
through
an
increasing
circle
*NL*
of
works
of
supererogation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
part
of
his
day
,
divided
by
what
he
regarded
now
as
the
duties
of
*NL*
his
station
in
life
,
circled
about
its
own
centre
of
spiritual
energy
.
*NL*
His
life
seemed
to
have
drawn
near
to
eternity
;
every
thought
,
word
,
*NL*
and
deed
,
every
instance
of
consciousness
could
be
made
to
revibrate
*NL*
radiantly
in
heaven
;
and
at
times
his
sense
of
such
immediate
*NL*
repercussion
was
so
lively
that
he
seemed
to
feel
his
soul
in
devotion
*NL*
pressing
like
fingers
the
keyboard
of
a
great
cash
register
and
to
see
*NL*
the
amount
of
his
purchase
start
forth
immediately
in
heaven
,
not
as
a
*NL*
number
but
as
a
frail
column
of
incense
or
as
a
slender
flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rosaries
,
too
,
which
he
said
constantly
--
for
he
carried
his
beads
*NL*
loose
in
his
trousers
'
pockets
that
he
might
tell
them
as
he
walked
the
*NL*
streets
--
transformed
themselves
into
coronals
of
flowers
of
such
vague
*NL*
unearthly
texture
that
they
seemed
to
him
as
hueless
and
odourless
as
*NL*
they
were
nameless
.
He
offered
up
each
of
his
three
daily
chaplets
that
*NL*
his
soul
might
grow
strong
in
each
of
the
three
theological
virtues
,
in
*NL*
faith
in
the
Father
Who
had
created
him
,
in
hope
in
the
Son
Who
had
*NL*
redeemed
him
and
in
love
of
the
Holy
Ghost
Who
had
sanctified
him
;
and
*NL*
this
thrice
triple
prayer
he
offered
to
the
Three
Persons
through
Mary
*NL*
in
the
name
of
her
joyful
and
sorrowful
and
glorious
mysteries
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
each
of
the
seven
days
of
the
week
he
further
prayed
that
one
of
the
*NL*
seven
gifts
of
the
Holy
Ghost
might
descend
upon
his
soul
and
drive
out
*NL*
of
it
day
by
day
the
seven
deadly
sins
which
had
defiled
it
in
the
*NL*
past
;
and
he
prayed
for
each
gift
on
its
appointed
day
,
confident
that
*NL*
it
would
descend
upon
him
,
though
it
seemed
strange
to
him
at
times
*NL*
that
wisdom
and
understanding
and
knowledge
were
so
distinct
in
their
*NL*
nature
that
each
should
be
prayed
for
apart
from
the
others
.
Yet
he
*NL*
believed
that
at
some
future
stage
of
his
spiritual
progress
this
*NL*
difficulty
would
be
removed
when
his
sinful
soul
had
been
raised
up
*NL*
from
its
weakness
and
enlightened
by
the
Third
Person
of
the
Most
*NL*
Blessed
Trinity
.
He
believed
this
all
the
more
,
and
with
trepidation
,
*NL*
because
of
the
divine
gloom
and
silence
wherein
dwelt
the
unseen
*NL*
Paraclete
,
Whose
symbols
were
a
dove
and
a
mighty
wind
,
to
sin
against
*NL*
Whom
was
a
sin
beyond
forgiveness
,
the
eternal
mysterious
secret
Being
*NL*
to
Whom
,
as
God
,
the
priests
offered
up
mass
once
a
year
,
robed
in
the
*NL*
scarlet
of
the
tongues
of
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
imagery
through
which
the
nature
and
kinship
of
the
Three
Persons
*NL*
of
the
Trinity
were
darkly
shadowed
forth
in
the
books
of
devotion
*NL*
which
he
read
--
the
Father
contemplating
from
all
eternity
as
in
a
*NL*
mirror
His
Divine
Perfections
and
thereby
begetting
eternally
the
*NL*
Eternal
Son
and
the
Holy
Spirit
proceeding
out
of
Father
and
Son
from
*NL*
all
eternity
--
were
easier
of
acceptance
by
his
mind
by
reason
of
their
*NL*
august
incomprehensibility
than
was
the
simple
fact
that
God
had
loved
*NL*
his
soul
from
all
eternity
,
for
ages
before
he
had
been
born
into
the
*NL*
world
,
for
ages
before
the
world
itself
had
existed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
heard
the
names
of
the
passions
of
love
and
hate
pronounced
*NL*
solemnly
on
the
stage
and
in
the
pulpit
,
had
found
them
set
forth
*NL*
solemnly
in
books
and
had
wondered
why
his
soul
was
unable
to
harbour
*NL*
them
for
any
time
or
to
force
his
lips
to
utter
their
names
with
*NL*
conviction
.
A
brief
anger
had
often
invested
him
but
he
had
never
been
*NL*
able
to
make
it
an
abiding
passion
and
had
always
felt
himself
passing
*NL*
out
of
it
as
if
his
very
body
were
being
divested
with
ease
of
some
*NL*
outer
skin
or
peel
.
He
had
felt
a
subtle
,
dark
,
and
murmurous
presence
*NL*
penetrate
his
being
and
fire
him
with
a
brief
iniquitous
lust
:
it
,
too
,
*NL*
had
slipped
beyond
his
grasp
leaving
his
mind
lucid
and
indifferent
.
*NL*
This
,
it
seemed
,
was
the
only
love
and
that
the
only
hate
his
soul
*NL*
would
harbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
could
no
longer
disbelieve
in
the
reality
of
love
,
since
God
*NL*
Himself
had
loved
his
individual
soul
with
divine
love
from
all
*NL*
eternity
.
Gradually
,
as
his
soul
was
enriched
with
spiritual
knowledge
,
*NL*
he
saw
the
whole
world
forming
one
vast
symmetrical
expression
of
God
's
*NL*
power
and
love
.
Life
became
a
divine
gift
for
every
moment
and
*NL*
sensation
of
which
,
were
it
even
the
sight
of
a
single
leaf
hanging
on
*NL*
the
twig
of
a
tree
,
his
soul
should
praise
and
thank
the
Giver
.
The
*NL*
world
for
all
its
solid
substance
and
complexity
no
longer
existed
for
*NL*
his
soul
save
as
a
theorem
of
divine
power
and
love
and
universality
.
*NL*
So
entire
and
unquestionable
was
this
sense
of
the
divine
meaning
in
*NL*
all
nature
granted
to
his
soul
that
he
could
scarcely
understand
why
it
*NL*
was
in
any
way
necessary
that
he
should
continue
to
live
.
Yet
that
was
*NL*
part
of
the
divine
purpose
and
he
dared
not
question
its
use
,
he
above
*NL*
all
others
who
had
sinned
so
deeply
and
so
foully
against
the
divine
*NL*
purpose
.
Meek
and
abased
by
this
consciousness
of
the
one
eternal
*NL*
omnipresent
perfect
reality
his
soul
took
up
again
her
burden
of
*NL*
pieties
,
masses
and
prayers
and
sacraments
and
mortifications
,
and
only
*NL*
then
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
brooded
on
the
great
mystery
of
*NL*
love
did
he
feel
within
him
a
warm
movement
like
that
of
some
newly
*NL*
born
life
or
virtue
of
the
soul
itself
.
The
attitude
of
rapture
in
*NL*
sacred
art
,
the
raised
and
parted
hands
,
the
parted
lips
and
eyes
as
of
*NL*
one
about
to
swoon
,
became
for
him
an
image
of
the
soul
in
prayer
,
*NL*
humiliated
and
faint
before
her
Creator
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
been
forewarned
of
the
dangers
of
spiritual
exaltation
and
*NL*
did
not
allow
himself
to
desist
from
even
the
least
or
lowliest
*NL*
devotion
,
striving
also
by
constant
mortification
to
undo
the
sinful
*NL*
past
rather
than
to
achieve
a
saintliness
fraught
with
peril
.
Each
of
*NL*
his
senses
was
brought
under
a
rigorous
discipline
.
In
order
to
mortify
*NL*
the
sense
of
sight
he
made
it
his
rule
to
walk
in
the
street
with
*NL*
downcast
eyes
,
glancing
neither
to
right
nor
left
and
never
behind
him
.
*NL*
His
eyes
shunned
every
encounter
with
the
eyes
of
women
.
From
time
to
*NL*
time
also
he
balked
them
by
a
sudden
effort
of
the
will
,
as
by
lifting
*NL*
them
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
an
unfinished
sentence
and
closing
the
*NL*
book
.
To
mortify
his
hearing
he
exerted
no
control
over
his
voice
which
*NL*
was
then
breaking
,
neither
sang
nor
whistled
,
and
made
no
attempt
to
*NL*
flee
from
noises
which
caused
him
painful
nervous
irritation
such
as
*NL*
the
sharpening
of
knives
on
the
knife
board
,
the
gathering
of
cinders
*NL*
on
the
fire-shovel
and
the
twigging
of
the
carpet
.
To
mortify
his
smell
*NL*
was
more
difficult
as
he
found
in
himself
no
instinctive
repugnance
to
*NL*
bad
odours
whether
they
were
the
odours
of
the
outdoor
world
,
such
as
*NL*
those
of
dung
or
tar
,
or
the
odours
of
his
own
person
among
which
he
*NL*
had
made
many
curious
comparisons
and
experiments
.
He
found
in
the
end
*NL*
that
the
only
odour
against
which
his
sense
of
smell
revolted
was
a
*NL*
certain
stale
fishy
stink
like
that
of
long-standing
urine
;
and
*NL*
whenever
it
was
possible
he
subjected
himself
to
this
unpleasant
odour
.
*NL*
To
mortify
the
taste
he
practised
strict
habits
at
table
,
observed
to
*NL*
the
letter
all
the
fasts
of
the
church
and
sought
by
distraction
to
*NL*
divert
his
mind
from
the
savours
of
different
foods
.
But
it
was
to
the
*NL*
mortification
of
touch
he
brought
the
most
assiduous
ingenuity
of
*NL*
inventiveness
.
He
never
consciously
changed
his
position
in
bed
,
sat
in
*NL*
the
most
uncomfortable
positions
,
suffered
patiently
every
itch
and
*NL*
pain
,
kept
away
from
the
fire
,
remained
on
his
knees
all
through
the
*NL*
mass
except
at
the
gospels
,
left
part
of
his
neck
and
face
undried
so
*NL*
that
air
might
sting
them
and
,
whenever
he
was
not
saying
his
beads
,
*NL*
carried
his
arms
stiffly
at
his
sides
like
a
runner
and
never
in
his
*NL*
pockets
or
clasped
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
temptations
to
sin
mortally
.
It
surprised
him
however
to
find
*NL*
that
at
the
end
of
his
course
of
intricate
piety
and
self-restraint
he
*NL*
was
so
easily
at
the
mercy
of
childish
and
unworthy
imperfections
.
His
*NL*
prayers
and
fasts
availed
him
little
for
the
suppression
of
anger
at
*NL*
hearing
his
mother
sneeze
or
at
being
disturbed
in
his
devotions
.
It
*NL*
needed
an
immense
effort
of
his
will
to
master
the
impulse
which
urged
*NL*
him
to
give
outlet
to
such
irritation
.
Images
of
the
outbursts
of
*NL*
trivial
anger
which
he
had
often
noted
among
his
masters
,
their
*NL*
twitching
mouths
,
close-shut
lips
and
flushed
cheeks
,
recurred
to
his
*NL*
memory
,
discouraging
him
,
for
all
his
practice
of
humility
,
by
the
*NL*
comparison
.
To
merge
his
life
in
the
common
tide
of
other
lives
was
*NL*
harder
for
him
than
any
fasting
or
prayer
and
it
was
his
constant
*NL*
failure
to
do
this
to
his
own
satisfaction
which
caused
in
his
soul
at
*NL*
last
a
sensation
of
spiritual
dryness
together
with
a
growth
of
doubts
*NL*
and
scruples
.
His
soul
traversed
a
period
of
desolation
in
which
the
*NL*
sacraments
themselves
seemed
to
have
turned
into
dried-up
sources
.
His
*NL*
confession
became
a
channel
for
the
escape
of
scrupulous
and
unrepented
*NL*
imperfections
.
His
actual
reception
of
the
eucharist
did
not
bring
him
*NL*
the
same
dissolving
moments
of
virginal
self-surrender
as
did
those
*NL*
spiritual
communions
made
by
him
sometimes
at
the
close
of
some
visit
*NL*
to
the
Blessed
Sacrament
.
The
book
which
he
used
for
these
visits
was
*NL*
an
old
neglected
book
written
by
saint
Alphonsus
Liguori
,
with
fading
*NL*
characters
and
sere
foxpapered
leaves
.
A
faded
world
of
fervent
love
*NL*
and
virginal
responses
seemed
to
be
evoked
for
his
soul
by
the
reading
*NL*
of
its
pages
in
which
the
imagery
of
the
canticles
was
interwoven
with
*NL*
the
communicant
's
prayers
.
An
inaudible
voice
seemed
to
caress
the
*NL*
soul
,
telling
her
names
and
glories
,
bidding
her
arise
as
for
espousal
*NL*
and
come
away
,
bidding
her
look
forth
,
a
spouse
,
from
Amana
and
from
*NL*
the
mountains
of
the
leopards
;
and
the
soul
seemed
to
answer
with
the
*NL*
same
inaudible
voice
,
surrendering
herself
:
INTER
UBERA
MEA
*NL*
COMMORABITUR
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
of
surrender
had
a
perilous
attraction
for
his
mind
now
that
*NL*
he
felt
his
soul
beset
once
again
by
the
insistent
voices
of
the
flesh
*NL*
which
began
to
murmur
to
him
again
during
his
prayers
and
meditations
.
*NL*
It
gave
him
an
intense
sense
of
power
to
know
that
he
could
,
by
a
*NL*
single
act
of
consent
,
in
a
moment
of
thought
,
undo
all
that
he
had
*NL*
done
.
He
seemed
to
feel
a
flood
slowly
advancing
towards
his
naked
feet
*NL*
and
to
be
waiting
for
the
first
faint
timid
noiseless
wavelet
to
touch
*NL*
his
fevered
skin
.
Then
,
almost
at
the
instant
of
that
touch
,
almost
at
*NL*
the
verge
of
sinful
consent
,
he
found
himself
standing
far
away
from
*NL*
the
flood
upon
a
dry
shore
,
saved
by
a
sudden
act
of
the
will
or
a
*NL*
sudden
ejaculation
;
and
,
seeing
the
silver
line
of
the
flood
far
away
*NL*
and
beginning
again
its
slow
advance
towards
his
feet
,
a
new
thrill
of
*NL*
power
and
satisfaction
shook
his
soul
to
know
that
he
had
not
yielded
*NL*
nor
undone
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
eluded
the
flood
of
temptation
many
times
in
this
way
he
*NL*
grew
troubled
and
wondered
whether
the
grace
which
he
had
refused
to
*NL*
lose
was
not
being
filched
from
him
little
by
little
.
The
clear
*NL*
certitude
of
his
own
immunity
grew
dim
and
to
it
succeeded
a
vague
fear
*NL*
that
his
soul
had
really
fallen
unawares
.
It
was
with
difficulty
that
*NL*
he
won
back
his
old
consciousness
of
his
state
of
grace
by
telling
*NL*
himself
that
he
had
prayed
to
God
at
every
temptation
and
that
the
*NL*
grace
which
he
had
prayed
for
must
have
been
given
to
him
inasmuch
as
*NL*
God
was
obliged
to
give
it
.
The
very
frequency
and
violence
of
*NL*
temptations
showed
him
at
last
the
truth
of
what
he
had
heard
about
the
*NL*
trials
of
the
saints
.
Frequent
and
violent
temptations
were
a
proof
*NL*
that
the
citadel
of
the
soul
had
not
fallen
and
that
the
devil
raged
to
*NL*
make
it
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
when
he
had
confessed
his
doubts
and
scruples
--
some
momentary
*NL*
inattention
at
prayer
,
a
movement
of
trivial
anger
in
his
soul
,
or
a
*NL*
subtle
wilfulness
in
speech
or
act
--
he
was
bidden
by
his
confessor
to
*NL*
name
some
sin
of
his
past
life
before
absolution
was
given
him
.
He
*NL*
named
it
with
humility
and
shame
and
repented
of
it
once
more
.
It
*NL*
humiliated
and
shamed
him
to
think
that
he
would
never
be
freed
from
it
*NL*
wholly
,
however
holily
he
might
live
or
whatever
virtues
or
perfections
*NL*
he
might
attain
.
A
restless
feeling
of
guilt
would
always
be
present
*NL*
with
him
:
he
would
confess
and
repent
and
be
absolved
,
confess
and
*NL*
repent
again
and
be
absolved
again
,
fruitlessly
.
Perhaps
that
first
*NL*
hasty
confession
wrung
from
him
by
the
fear
of
hell
had
not
been
good
?
*NL*
Perhaps
,
concerned
only
for
his
imminent
doom
,
he
had
not
had
sincere
*NL*
sorrow
for
his
sin
?
But
the
surest
sign
that
his
confession
had
been
*NL*
good
and
that
he
had
had
sincere
sorrow
for
his
sin
was
,
he
knew
,
the
*NL*
amendment
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
amended
my
life
,
have
I
not
?
he
asked
himself
.

The
director
stood
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
,
his
back
to
the
*NL*
light
,
leaning
an
elbow
on
the
brown
crossblind
,
and
,
as
he
spoke
and
*NL*
smiled
,
slowly
dangling
and
looping
the
cord
of
the
other
blind
,
*NL*
Stephen
stood
before
him
,
following
for
a
moment
with
his
eyes
the
*NL*
waning
of
the
long
summer
daylight
above
the
roofs
or
the
slow
deft
*NL*
movements
of
the
priestly
fingers
.
The
priest
's
face
was
in
total
*NL*
shadow
,
but
the
waning
daylight
from
behind
him
touched
the
deeply
*NL*
grooved
temples
and
the
curves
of
the
skull
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
followed
also
with
his
ears
the
accents
and
intervals
of
the
*NL*
priest
's
voice
as
he
spoke
gravely
and
cordially
of
indifferent
themes
,
*NL*
the
vacation
which
had
just
ended
,
the
colleges
of
the
order
abroad
,
*NL*
the
transference
of
masters
.
The
grave
and
cordial
voice
went
on
easily
*NL*
with
its
tale
and
in
the
pauses
Stephen
felt
bound
to
set
it
on
again
*NL*
with
respectful
questions
.
He
knew
that
the
tale
was
a
prelude
and
his
*NL*
mind
waited
for
the
sequel
.
Ever
since
the
message
of
summons
had
come
*NL*
for
him
from
the
director
his
mind
had
struggled
to
find
the
meaning
of
*NL*
the
message
;
and
,
during
the
long
restless
time
he
had
sat
in
the
*NL*
college
parlour
waiting
for
the
director
to
come
in
,
his
eyes
had
*NL*
wandered
from
one
sober
picture
to
another
around
the
walls
and
his
*NL*
mind
wandered
from
one
guess
to
another
until
the
meaning
of
the
*NL*
summons
had
almost
become
clear
.
Then
,
just
as
he
was
wishing
that
some
*NL*
unforeseen
cause
might
prevent
the
director
from
coming
,
he
had
heard
*NL*
the
handle
of
the
door
turning
and
the
swish
of
a
soutane
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
director
had
begun
to
speak
of
the
dominican
and
franciscan
orders
*NL*
and
of
the
friendship
between
saint
Thomas
and
saint
Bonaventure
.
The
*NL*
capuchin
dress
,
he
thought
,
was
rather
too
...
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
's
face
gave
back
the
priest
's
indulgent
smile
and
,
not
being
*NL*
anxious
to
give
an
opinion
,
he
made
a
slight
dubitative
movement
with
*NL*
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
believe
,
continued
the
director
,
that
there
is
some
talk
now
among
*NL*
the
capuchins
themselves
of
doing
away
with
it
and
following
the
*NL*
example
of
the
other
franciscans
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
suppose
they
would
retain
it
in
the
cloisters
?
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
certainly
,
said
the
director
.
For
the
cloister
it
is
all
right
but
*NL*
for
the
street
I
really
think
it
would
be
better
to
do
away
with
it
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
must
be
troublesome
,
I
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
course
it
is
,
of
course
.
Just
imagine
when
I
was
in
Belgium
I
*NL*
used
to
see
them
out
cycling
in
all
kinds
of
weather
with
this
thing
up
*NL*
about
their
knees
!
It
was
really
ridiculous
.
LES
JUPES
,
they
call
them
*NL*
in
Belgium
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vowel
was
so
modified
as
to
be
indistinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
do
they
call
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
LES
JUPES
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
!
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
smiled
again
in
answer
to
the
smile
which
he
could
not
see
on
*NL*
the
priest
's
shadowed
face
,
its
image
or
spectre
only
passing
rapidly
*NL*
across
his
mind
as
the
low
discreet
accent
fell
upon
his
ear
.
He
gazed
*NL*
calmly
before
him
at
the
waning
sky
,
glad
of
the
cool
of
the
evening
*NL*
and
of
the
faint
yellow
glow
which
hid
the
tiny
flame
kindling
upon
his
*NL*
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
names
of
articles
of
dress
worn
by
women
or
of
certain
soft
and
*NL*
delicate
stuffs
used
in
their
making
brought
always
to
his
mind
a
*NL*
delicate
and
sinful
perfume
.
As
a
boy
he
had
imagined
the
reins
by
*NL*
which
horses
are
driven
as
slender
silken
bands
and
it
shocked
him
to
*NL*
feel
at
Stradbrooke
the
greasy
leather
of
harness
.
It
had
shocked
him
,
*NL*
too
,
when
he
had
felt
for
the
first
time
beneath
his
tremulous
fingers
*NL*
the
brittle
texture
of
a
woman
's
stocking
for
,
retaining
nothing
of
all
*NL*
he
read
save
that
which
seemed
to
him
an
echo
or
a
prophecy
of
his
own
*NL*
state
,
it
was
only
amid
soft-worded
phrases
or
within
rose-soft
stuffs
*NL*
that
he
dared
to
conceive
of
the
soul
or
body
of
a
woman
moving
with
*NL*
tender
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
phrase
on
the
priest
's
lips
was
disingenuous
for
he
knew
that
a
*NL*
priest
should
not
speak
lightly
on
that
theme
.
The
phrase
had
been
*NL*
spoken
lightly
with
design
and
he
felt
that
his
face
was
being
searched
*NL*
by
the
eyes
in
the
shadow
.
Whatever
he
had
heard
or
read
of
the
craft
*NL*
of
jesuits
he
had
put
aside
frankly
as
not
borne
out
by
his
own
*NL*
experience
.
His
masters
,
even
when
they
had
not
attracted
him
,
*NL*
had
seemed
to
him
always
intelligent
and
serious
priests
,
*NL*
athletic
and
high-spirited
prefects
.
He
thought
of
them
as
men
*NL*
who
washed
their
bodies
briskly
with
cold
water
and
wore
clean
cold
*NL*
linen
.
During
all
the
years
he
had
lived
among
them
in
Clongowes
and
in
*NL*
Belvedere
he
had
received
only
two
pandies
and
,
though
these
had
been
*NL*
dealt
him
in
the
wrong
,
he
knew
that
he
had
often
escaped
punishment
.
*NL*
During
all
those
years
he
had
never
heard
from
any
of
his
masters
a
*NL*
flippant
word
:
it
was
they
who
had
taught
him
christian
doctrine
and
*NL*
urged
him
to
live
a
good
life
and
,
when
he
had
fallen
into
grievous
*NL*
sin
,
it
was
they
who
had
led
him
back
to
grace
.
Their
presence
had
made
*NL*
him
diffident
of
himself
when
he
was
a
muff
in
Clongowes
and
it
had
made
*NL*
him
diffident
of
himself
also
while
he
had
held
his
equivocal
position
*NL*
in
Belvedere
.
A
constant
sense
of
this
had
remained
with
him
up
to
the
*NL*
last
year
of
his
school
life
.
He
had
never
once
disobeyed
or
allowed
*NL*
turbulent
companions
to
seduce
him
from
his
habit
of
quiet
obedience
;
*NL*
and
,
even
when
he
doubted
some
statement
of
a
master
,
he
had
never
*NL*
presumed
to
doubt
openly
.
Lately
some
of
their
judgements
had
sounded
a
*NL*
little
childish
in
his
ears
and
had
made
him
feel
a
regret
and
pity
as
*NL*
though
he
were
slowly
passing
out
of
an
accustomed
world
and
were
*NL*
hearing
its
language
for
the
last
time
.
One
day
when
some
boys
had
*NL*
gathered
round
a
priest
under
the
shed
near
the
chapel
,
he
had
heard
*NL*
the
priest
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
believe
that
Lord
Macaulay
was
a
man
who
probably
never
committed
*NL*
a
mortal
sin
in
his
life
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
deliberate
mortal
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
boys
had
then
asked
the
priest
if
Victor
Hugo
were
not
the
*NL*
greatest
French
writer
.
The
priest
had
answered
that
Victor
Hugo
had
*NL*
never
written
half
so
well
when
he
had
turned
against
the
church
as
he
*NL*
had
written
when
he
was
a
catholic
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
there
are
many
eminent
French
critics
,
said
the
priest
,
who
*NL*
consider
that
even
Victor
Hugo
,
great
as
he
certainly
was
,
had
not
so
*NL*
pure
a
French
style
as
Louis
Veuillot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tiny
flame
which
the
priest
's
allusion
had
kindled
upon
Stephen
's
*NL*
cheek
had
sunk
down
again
and
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
calmly
on
the
*NL*
colourless
sky
.
But
an
unresting
doubt
flew
hither
and
thither
before
*NL*
his
mind
.
Masked
memories
passed
quickly
before
him
:
he
recognized
*NL*
scenes
and
persons
yet
he
was
conscious
that
he
had
failed
to
perceive
*NL*
some
vital
circumstance
in
them
.
He
saw
himself
walking
about
the
*NL*
grounds
watching
the
sports
in
Clongowes
and
eating
slim
jim
out
of
his
*NL*
cricket
cap
.
Some
jesuits
were
walking
round
the
cycle-track
in
the
*NL*
company
of
ladies
.
The
echoes
of
certain
expressions
used
in
Clongowes
*NL*
sounded
in
remote
caves
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
ears
were
listening
to
these
distant
echoes
amid
the
silence
of
the
*NL*
parlour
when
he
became
aware
that
the
priest
was
addressing
him
in
a
*NL*
different
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
sent
for
you
today
,
Stephen
,
because
I
wished
to
speak
to
you
on
a
*NL*
very
important
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Have
you
ever
felt
that
you
had
a
vocation
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
parted
his
lips
to
answer
yes
and
then
withheld
the
word
*NL*
suddenly
.
The
priest
waited
for
the
answer
and
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
mean
,
have
you
ever
felt
within
yourself
,
in
your
soul
,
a
desire
*NL*
to
join
the
order
?
Think
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
sometimes
thought
of
it
,
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
let
the
blindcord
fall
to
one
side
and
,
uniting
his
hands
,
*NL*
leaned
his
chin
gravely
upon
them
,
communing
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
a
college
like
this
,
he
said
at
length
,
there
is
one
boy
or
perhaps
*NL*
two
or
three
boys
whom
God
calls
to
the
religious
life
.
Such
a
boy
is
*NL*
marked
off
from
his
companions
by
his
piety
,
by
the
good
example
he
*NL*
shows
to
others
.
He
is
looked
up
to
by
them
;
he
is
chosen
perhaps
as
*NL*
prefect
by
his
fellow
sodalists
.
And
you
,
Stephen
,
have
been
such
a
boy
*NL*
in
this
college
,
prefect
of
Our
Blessed
Lady
's
sodality
.
Perhaps
you
*NL*
are
the
boy
in
this
college
whom
God
designs
to
call
to
Himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
strong
note
of
pride
reinforcing
the
gravity
of
the
priest
's
voice
*NL*
made
Stephen
's
heart
quicken
in
response
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
receive
that
call
,
Stephen
,
said
the
priest
,
is
the
greatest
honour
*NL*
that
the
Almighty
God
can
bestow
upon
a
man
.
No
king
or
emperor
on
this
*NL*
earth
has
the
power
of
the
priest
of
God
.
No
angel
or
archangel
in
*NL*
heaven
,
no
saint
,
not
even
the
Blessed
Virgin
herself
,
has
the
power
of
*NL*
a
priest
of
God
:
the
power
of
the
keys
,
the
power
to
bind
and
to
loose
*NL*
from
sin
,
the
power
of
exorcism
,
the
power
to
cast
out
from
the
*NL*
creatures
of
God
the
evil
spirits
that
have
power
over
them
;
the
power
,
*NL*
the
authority
,
to
make
the
great
God
of
Heaven
come
down
upon
the
altar
*NL*
and
take
the
form
of
bread
and
wine
.
What
an
awful
power
,
Stephen
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
flame
began
to
flutter
again
on
Stephen
's
cheek
as
he
heard
in
this
*NL*
proud
address
an
echo
of
his
own
proud
musings
.
How
often
had
he
seen
*NL*
himself
as
a
priest
wielding
calmly
and
humbly
the
awful
power
*NL*
of
which
angels
and
saints
stood
in
reverence
!
His
soul
had
loved
*NL*
to
muse
in
secret
on
this
desire
.
He
had
seen
himself
,
a
young
*NL*
and
silent-mannered
priest
,
entering
a
confessional
swiftly
,
*NL*
ascending
the
altarsteps
,
incensing
,
genuflecting
,
accomplishing
*NL*
the
vague
acts
of
the
priesthood
which
pleased
him
by
reason
of
*NL*
their
semblance
of
reality
and
of
their
distance
from
it
.
In
that
*NL*
dim
life
which
he
had
lived
through
in
his
musings
he
had
*NL*
assumed
the
voices
and
gestures
which
he
had
noted
with
various
*NL*
priests
.
He
had
bent
his
knee
sideways
like
such
a
one
,
he
had
*NL*
shaken
the
thurible
only
slightly
like
such
a
one
,
his
chasuble
had
*NL*
swung
open
like
that
of
such
another
as
he
turned
to
the
altar
again
*NL*
after
having
blessed
the
people
.
And
above
all
it
had
pleased
him
to
*NL*
fill
the
second
place
in
those
dim
scenes
of
his
imagining
.
He
shrank
*NL*
from
the
dignity
of
celebrant
because
it
displeased
him
to
imagine
that
*NL*
all
the
vague
pomp
should
end
in
his
own
person
or
that
the
ritual
*NL*
should
assign
to
him
so
clear
and
final
an
office
.
He
longed
for
the
*NL*
minor
sacred
offices
,
to
be
vested
with
the
tunicle
of
subdeacon
at
*NL*
high
mass
,
to
stand
aloof
from
the
altar
,
forgotten
by
the
people
,
his
*NL*
shoulders
covered
with
a
humeral
veil
,
holding
the
paten
within
its
*NL*
folds
or
,
when
the
sacrifice
had
been
accomplished
,
to
stand
as
deacon
*NL*
in
a
dalmatic
of
cloth
of
gold
on
the
step
below
the
celebrant
,
his
*NL*
hands
joined
and
his
face
towards
the
people
,
and
sing
the
chant
ITE
*NL*
MISSA
EST.
.
If
ever
he
had
seen
himself
celebrant
it
was
as
in
the
*NL*
pictures
of
the
mass
in
his
child
's
massbook
,
in
a
church
without
*NL*
worshippers
,
save
for
the
angel
of
the
sacrifice
,
at
a
bare
altar
,
and
*NL*
served
by
an
acolyte
scarcely
more
boyish
than
himself
.
In
vague
*NL*
sacrificial
or
sacramental
acts
alone
his
will
seemed
drawn
to
go
forth
*NL*
to
encounter
reality
;
and
it
was
partly
the
absence
of
an
appointed
*NL*
rite
which
had
always
constrained
him
to
inaction
whether
he
had
*NL*
allowed
silence
to
cover
his
anger
or
pride
or
had
suffered
only
an
*NL*
embrace
he
longed
to
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
in
reverent
silence
now
to
the
priest
's
appeal
and
through
*NL*
the
words
he
heard
even
more
distinctly
a
voice
bidding
him
approach
,
*NL*
offering
him
secret
knowledge
and
secret
power
.
He
would
know
then
what
*NL*
was
the
sin
of
Simon
Magus
and
what
the
sin
against
the
Holy
Ghost
for
*NL*
which
there
was
no
forgiveness
.
He
would
know
obscure
things
,
hidden
*NL*
from
others
,
from
those
who
were
conceived
and
born
children
of
wrath
.
*NL*
He
would
know
the
sins
,
the
sinful
longings
and
sinful
thoughts
and
*NL*
sinful
acts
,
of
others
,
hearing
them
murmured
into
his
ears
in
the
*NL*
confessional
under
the
shame
of
a
darkened
chapel
by
the
lips
of
women
*NL*
and
of
girls
;
but
rendered
immune
mysteriously
at
his
ordination
by
the
*NL*
imposition
of
hands
,
his
soul
would
pass
again
uncontaminated
to
the
*NL*
white
peace
of
the
altar
.
No
touch
of
sin
would
linger
upon
the
hands
*NL*
with
which
he
would
elevate
and
break
the
host
;
no
touch
of
sin
would
*NL*
linger
on
his
lips
in
prayer
to
make
him
eat
and
drink
damnation
to
*NL*
himself
not
discerning
the
body
of
the
Lord
.
He
would
hold
his
secret
*NL*
knowledge
and
secret
power
,
being
as
sinless
as
the
innocent
,
and
he
*NL*
would
be
a
priest
for
ever
according
to
the
order
of
Melchisedec
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
will
offer
up
my
mass
tomorrow
morning
,
said
the
director
,
that
*NL*
Almighty
God
may
reveal
to
you
His
holy
will
.
And
let
you
,
Stephen
,
*NL*
make
a
novena
to
your
holy
patron
saint
,
the
first
martyr
,
who
is
very
*NL*
powerful
with
God
,
that
God
may
enlighten
your
mind
.
But
you
must
be
*NL*
quite
sure
,
Stephen
,
that
you
have
a
vocation
because
it
would
be
*NL*
terrible
if
you
found
afterwards
that
you
had
none
.
Once
a
priest
*NL*
always
a
priest
,
remember
.
Your
catechism
tells
you
that
the
sacrament
*NL*
of
Holy
Orders
is
one
of
those
which
can
be
received
only
once
because
*NL*
it
imprints
on
the
soul
an
indelible
spiritual
mark
which
can
never
be
*NL*
effaced
.
It
is
before
you
must
weigh
well
,
not
after
.
It
is
a
solemn
*NL*
question
,
Stephen
,
because
on
it
may
depend
the
salvation
of
your
*NL*
eternal
soul
.
But
we
will
pray
to
God
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
open
the
heavy
hall
door
and
gave
his
hand
as
if
already
to
a
*NL*
companion
in
the
spiritual
life
.
Stephen
passed
out
on
to
the
wide
*NL*
platform
above
the
steps
and
was
conscious
of
the
caress
of
mild
*NL*
evening
air
.
Towards
Findlater
's
church
a
quartet
of
young
men
were
*NL*
striding
along
with
linked
arms
,
swaying
their
heads
and
stepping
to
*NL*
the
agile
melody
of
their
leader
's
concertina
.
The
music
passed
in
an
*NL*
instant
,
as
the
first
bars
of
sudden
music
always
did
,
over
the
*NL*
fantastic
fabrics
of
his
mind
,
dissolving
them
painlessly
and
*NL*
noiselessly
as
a
sudden
wave
dissolves
the
sand-built
turrets
of
*NL*
children
.
Smiling
at
the
trivial
air
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
priest
's
*NL*
face
and
,
seeing
in
it
a
mirthless
reflection
of
the
sunken
day
,
*NL*
detached
his
hand
slowly
which
had
acquiesced
faintly
in
the
*NL*
companionship
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
descended
the
steps
the
impression
which
effaced
his
troubled
*NL*
self-communion
was
that
of
a
mirthless
mask
reflecting
a
sunken
day
*NL*
from
the
threshold
of
the
college
.
The
shadow
,
then
,
of
the
life
of
the
*NL*
college
passed
gravely
over
his
consciousness
.
It
was
a
grave
and
*NL*
ordered
and
passionless
life
that
awaited
him
,
a
life
without
material
*NL*
cares
.
He
wondered
how
he
would
pass
the
first
night
in
the
novitiate
*NL*
and
with
what
dismay
he
would
wake
the
first
morning
in
the
dormitory
.
*NL*
The
troubling
odour
of
the
long
corridors
of
Clongowes
came
back
to
him
*NL*
and
he
heard
the
discreet
murmur
of
the
burning
gasflames
.
At
once
from
*NL*
every
part
of
his
being
unrest
began
to
irradiate
.
A
feverish
*NL*
quickening
of
his
pulses
followed
,
and
a
din
of
meaningless
words
drove
*NL*
his
reasoned
thoughts
hither
and
thither
confusedly
.
His
lungs
dilated
*NL*
and
sank
as
if
he
were
inhaling
a
warm
moist
unsustaining
air
and
he
*NL*
smelt
again
the
moist
warm
air
which
hung
in
the
bath
in
Clongowes
*NL*
above
the
sluggish
turf-coloured
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
instinct
,
waking
at
these
memories
,
stronger
than
education
or
*NL*
piety
,
quickened
within
him
at
every
near
approach
to
that
life
,
an
*NL*
instinct
subtle
and
hostile
,
and
armed
him
against
acquiescence
.
The
*NL*
chill
and
order
of
the
life
repelled
him
.
He
saw
himself
rising
in
the
*NL*
cold
of
the
morning
and
filing
down
with
the
others
to
early
mass
and
*NL*
trying
vainly
to
struggle
with
his
prayers
against
the
fainting
*NL*
sickness
of
his
stomach
.
He
saw
himself
sitting
at
dinner
with
the
*NL*
community
of
a
college
.
What
,
then
,
had
become
of
that
deep-rooted
*NL*
shyness
of
his
which
had
made
him
loth
to
eat
or
drink
under
a
strange
*NL*
roof
?
What
had
come
of
the
pride
of
his
spirit
which
had
always
made
*NL*
him
conceive
himself
as
a
being
apart
in
every
order
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
Reverend
Stephen
Dedalus
,
S.J.
*NL*
*NL*
His
name
in
that
new
life
leaped
into
characters
before
his
eyes
and
to
*NL*
it
there
followed
a
mental
sensation
of
an
undefined
face
or
colour
of
*NL*
a
face
.
The
colour
faded
and
became
strong
like
a
changing
glow
of
*NL*
pallid
brick
red
.
Was
it
the
raw
reddish
glow
he
had
so
often
seen
on
*NL*
wintry
mornings
on
the
shaven
gills
of
the
priests
?
The
face
was
*NL*
eyeless
and
sour-favoured
and
devout
,
shot
with
pink
tinges
of
*NL*
suffocated
anger
.
Was
it
not
a
mental
spectre
of
the
face
of
one
of
the
*NL*
jesuits
whom
some
of
the
boys
called
Lantern
Jaws
and
others
Foxy
*NL*
Campbell
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
passing
at
that
moment
before
the
jesuit
house
in
Gardiner
*NL*
Street
and
wondered
vaguely
which
window
would
be
his
if
he
ever
joined
*NL*
the
order
.
Then
he
wondered
at
the
vagueness
of
his
wonder
,
at
the
*NL*
remoteness
of
his
own
soul
from
what
he
had
hitherto
imagined
her
*NL*
sanctuary
,
at
the
frail
hold
which
so
many
years
of
order
and
obedience
*NL*
had
of
him
when
once
a
definite
and
irrevocable
act
of
his
threatened
*NL*
to
end
for
ever
,
in
time
and
in
eternity
,
his
freedom
.
The
voice
of
the
*NL*
director
urging
upon
him
the
proud
claims
of
the
church
and
the
mystery
*NL*
and
power
of
the
priestly
office
repeated
itself
idly
in
his
memory
.
*NL*
His
soul
was
not
there
to
hear
and
greet
it
and
he
knew
now
that
the
*NL*
exhortation
he
had
listened
to
had
already
fallen
into
an
idle
formal
*NL*
tale
.
He
would
never
swing
the
thurible
before
the
tabernacle
as
priest
.
*NL*
His
destiny
was
to
be
elusive
of
social
or
religious
orders
.
The
wisdom
of
*NL*
the
priest
's
appeal
did
not
touch
him
to
the
quick
.
He
was
destined
to
*NL*
learn
his
own
wisdom
apart
from
others
or
to
learn
the
wisdom
of
others
*NL*
himself
wandering
among
the
snares
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
snares
of
the
world
were
its
ways
of
sin
.
He
would
fall
.
He
had
not
*NL*
yet
fallen
but
he
would
fall
silently
,
in
an
instant
.
Not
to
fall
was
*NL*
too
hard
,
too
hard
;
and
he
felt
the
silent
lapse
of
his
soul
,
as
it
*NL*
would
be
at
some
instant
to
come
,
falling
,
falling
,
but
not
yet
fallen
,
*NL*
still
unfallen
,
but
about
to
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
stream
of
the
Tolka
and
turned
his
eyes
*NL*
coldly
for
an
instant
towards
the
faded
blue
shrine
of
the
Blessed
*NL*
Virgin
which
stood
fowl-wise
on
a
pole
in
the
middle
of
a
ham-shaped
*NL*
encampment
of
poor
cottages
.
Then
,
bending
to
the
left
,
he
followed
the
*NL*
lane
which
led
up
to
his
house
.
The
faint
sour
stink
of
rotted
cabbages
*NL*
came
towards
him
from
the
kitchen
gardens
on
the
rising
ground
above
*NL*
the
river
.
He
smiled
to
think
that
it
was
this
disorder
,
the
misrule
*NL*
and
confusion
of
his
father
's
house
and
the
stagnation
of
vegetable
*NL*
life
,
which
was
to
win
the
day
in
his
soul
.
Then
a
short
laugh
broke
*NL*
from
his
lips
as
he
thought
of
that
solitary
farmhand
in
the
kitchen
*NL*
gardens
behind
their
house
whom
they
had
nicknamed
the
man
with
the
*NL*
hat
.
A
second
laugh
,
taking
rise
from
the
first
after
a
pause
,
broke
*NL*
from
him
involuntarily
as
he
thought
of
how
the
man
with
the
hat
*NL*
worked
,
considering
in
turn
the
four
points
of
the
sky
and
then
*NL*
regretfully
plunging
his
spade
in
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pushed
open
the
latchless
door
of
the
porch
and
passed
through
the
*NL*
naked
hallway
into
the
kitchen
.
A
group
of
his
brothers
and
sisters
was
*NL*
sitting
round
the
table
.
Tea
was
nearly
over
and
only
the
last
of
the
*NL*
second
watered
tea
remained
in
the
bottoms
of
the
small
glass
jars
and
*NL*
jampots
which
did
service
for
teacups
.
Discarded
crusts
and
lumps
of
*NL*
sugared
bread
,
turned
brown
by
the
tea
which
had
been
poured
over
them
,
*NL*
lay
scattered
on
the
table
.
Little
wells
of
tea
lay
here
and
there
on
*NL*
the
board
,
and
a
knife
with
a
broken
ivory
handle
was
stuck
through
the
*NL*
pith
of
a
ravaged
turnover
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sad
quiet
grey-blue
glow
of
the
dying
day
came
through
the
window
*NL*
and
the
open
door
,
covering
over
and
allaying
quietly
a
sudden
instinct
*NL*
of
remorse
in
Stephen
's
heart
.
All
that
had
been
denied
them
had
been
*NL*
freely
given
to
him
,
the
eldest
;
but
the
quiet
glow
of
evening
showed
*NL*
him
in
their
faces
no
sign
of
rancour
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
near
them
at
the
table
and
asked
where
his
father
and
mother
*NL*
were
.
One
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Goneboro
toboro
lookboro

aboro

.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
another
removal
!
A
boy
named
Fallon
in
Belvedere
had
often
asked
*NL*
him
with
a
silly
laugh
why
they
moved
so
often
.
A
frown
of
scorn
*NL*
darkened
quickly
his
forehead
as
he
heard
again
the
silly
laugh
of
the
*NL*
questioner
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
are
we
on
the
move
again
if
it
's
a
fair
question
?
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
of
his
youngest
brother
from
the
farther
side
of
the
*NL*
fireplace
began
to
sing
the
air
OFT
IN
THE
STILLY
NIGHT
.
One
by
one
the
*NL*
others
took
up
the
air
until
a
full
choir
of
voices
was
singing
.
They
*NL*
would
sing
so
for
hours
,
melody
after
melody
,
glee
after
glee
,
till
the
*NL*
last
pale
light
died
down
on
the
horizon
,
till
the
first
dark
night
*NL*
clouds
came
forth
and
night
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
for
some
moments
,
listening
,
before
he
too
took
up
the
air
*NL*
with
them
.
He
was
listening
with
pain
of
spirit
to
the
overtone
of
*NL*
weariness
behind
their
frail
fresh
innocent
voices
.
Even
before
they
*NL*
set
out
on
life
's
journey
they
seemed
weary
already
of
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
the
choir
of
voices
in
the
kitchen
echoed
and
multiplied
*NL*
through
an
endless
reverberation
of
the
choirs
of
endless
generations
*NL*
of
children
and
heard
in
all
the
echoes
an
echo
also
of
the
recurring
*NL*
note
of
weariness
and
pain
.
All
seemed
weary
of
life
even
before
*NL*
entering
upon
it
.
And
he
remembered
that
Newman
had
heard
this
note
*NL*
also
in
the
broken
lines
of
Virgil
,
GIVING
UTTERANCE
,
LIKE
THE
VOICE
OF
*NL*
NATURE
HERSELF
,
TO
THAT
PAIN
AND
WEARINESS
YET
HOPE
OF
BETTER
THINGS
*NL*
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
HER
CHILDREN
IN
EVERY
TIME
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
He
could
wait
no
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
door
of
Byron
's
public-house
to
the
gate
of
Clontarf
Chapel
,
*NL*
from
the
gate
of
Clontail
Chapel
to
the
door
of
Byron
's
public-house
*NL*
and
then
back
again
to
the
chapel
and
then
back
again
to
the
public-house
*NL*
he
had
paced
slowly
at
first
,
planting
his
steps
scrupulously
in
*NL*
the
spaces
of
the
patchwork
of
the
footpath
,
then
timing
their
fall
to
*NL*
the
fall
of
verses
.
A
full
hour
had
passed
since
his
father
had
gone
in
*NL*
with
Dan
Crosby
,
the
tutor
,
to
find
out
for
him
something
about
the
*NL*
university
.
For
a
full
hour
he
had
paced
up
and
down
,
waiting
:
but
he
*NL*
could
wait
no
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
off
abruptly
for
the
Bull
,
walking
rapidly
lest
his
father
's
*NL*
shrill
whistle
might
call
him
back
;
and
in
a
few
moments
he
had
rounded
*NL*
the
curve
at
the
police
barrack
and
was
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
his
mother
was
hostile
to
the
idea
,
as
he
had
read
from
her
*NL*
listless
silence
.
Yet
her
mistrust
pricked
him
more
keenly
than
his
*NL*
father
's
pride
and
he
thought
coldly
how
he
had
watched
the
faith
which
*NL*
was
fading
down
in
his
soul
ageing
and
strengthening
in
her
eyes
.
A
dim
*NL*
antagonism
gathered
force
within
him
and
darkened
his
mind
as
a
cloud
*NL*
against
her
disloyalty
and
when
it
passed
,
cloud-like
,
leaving
his
mind
*NL*
serene
and
dutiful
towards
her
again
,
he
was
made
aware
dimly
and
*NL*
without
regret
of
a
first
noiseless
sundering
of
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
university
!
So
he
had
passed
beyond
the
challenge
of
the
sentries
*NL*
who
had
stood
as
guardians
of
his
boyhood
and
had
sought
to
keep
him
*NL*
among
them
that
he
might
be
subject
to
them
and
serve
their
ends
.
Pride
*NL*
after
satisfaction
uplifted
him
like
long
slow
waves
.
The
end
he
had
*NL*
been
born
to
serve
yet
did
not
see
had
led
him
to
escape
by
an
unseen
*NL*
path
and
now
it
beckoned
to
him
once
more
and
a
new
adventure
was
about
*NL*
to
be
opened
to
him
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
notes
of
fitful
*NL*
music
leaping
upwards
a
tone
and
downwards
a
diminished
fourth
,
upwards
*NL*
a
tone
and
downwards
a
major
third
,
like
triple-branching
flames
*NL*
leaping
fitfully
,
flame
after
flame
,
out
of
a
midnight
wood
.
It
was
an
*NL*
elfin
prelude
,
endless
and
formless
;
and
,
as
it
grew
wilder
and
faster
,
*NL*
the
flames
leaping
out
of
time
,
he
seemed
to
hear
from
under
the
boughs
*NL*
and
grasses
wild
creatures
racing
,
their
feet
pattering
like
rain
upon
*NL*
the
leaves
.
Their
feet
passed
in
pattering
tumult
over
his
mind
,
the
*NL*
feet
of
hares
and
rabbits
,
the
feet
of
harts
and
hinds
and
antelopes
,
*NL*
until
he
heard
them
no
more
and
remembered
only
a
proud
cadence
from
*NL*
Newman
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Whose
feet
are
as
the
feet
of
harts
and
underneath
the
everlasting
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pride
of
that
dim
image
brought
back
to
his
mind
the
dignity
of
the
*NL*
office
he
had
refused
.
All
through
his
boyhood
he
had
mused
upon
that
*NL*
which
he
had
so
often
thought
to
be
his
destiny
and
when
the
moment
had
*NL*
come
for
him
to
obey
the
call
he
had
turned
aside
,
obeying
a
wayward
*NL*
instinct
.
Now
time
lay
between
:
the
oils
of
ordination
would
never
*NL*
anoint
his
body
.
He
had
refused
.
Why
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
seaward
from
the
road
at
Dollymount
and
as
he
passed
on
to
*NL*
the
thin
wooden
bridge
he
felt
the
planks
shaking
with
the
tramp
of
*NL*
heavily
shod
feet
.
A
squad
of
christian
brothers
was
on
its
way
back
*NL*
from
the
Bull
and
had
begun
to
pass
,
two
by
two
,
across
the
bridge
.
*NL*
Soon
the
whole
bridge
was
trembling
and
resounding
.
The
uncouth
faces
*NL*
passed
him
two
by
two
,
stained
yellow
or
red
or
livid
by
the
sea
,
and
,
*NL*
as
he
strove
to
look
at
them
with
ease
and
indifference
,
a
faint
stain
*NL*
of
personal
shame
and
commiseration
rose
to
his
own
face
.
Angry
with
*NL*
himself
he
tried
to
hide
his
face
from
their
eyes
by
gazing
down
*NL*
sideways
into
the
shallow
swirling
water
under
the
bridge
but
he
still
*NL*
saw
a
reflection
therein
of
their
top-heavy
silk
hats
and
humble
*NL*
tape-like
collars
and
loosely-hanging
clerical
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Brother
Hickey
.
*NL*
Brother
Quaid
.
*NL*
Brother
MacArdle
.
*NL*
Brother
Keogh
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Their
piety
would
be
like
their
names
,
like
their
faces
,
like
their
*NL*
clothes
,
and
it
was
idle
for
him
to
tell
himself
that
their
humble
and
*NL*
contrite
hearts
,
it
might
be
,
paid
a
far
richer
tribute
of
devotion
*NL*
than
his
had
ever
been
,
a
gift
tenfold
more
acceptable
than
his
*NL*
elaborate
adoration
.
It
was
idle
for
him
to
move
himself
to
be
generous
*NL*
towards
them
,
to
tell
himself
that
if
he
ever
came
to
their
gates
,
*NL*
stripped
of
his
pride
,
beaten
and
in
beggar
's
weeds
,
that
they
would
be
*NL*
generous
towards
him
,
loving
him
as
themselves
.
Idle
and
embittering
,
*NL*
finally
,
to
argue
,
against
his
own
dispassionate
certitude
,
that
the
*NL*
commandment
of
love
bade
us
not
to
love
our
neighbour
as
ourselves
with
*NL*
the
same
amount
and
intensity
of
love
but
to
love
him
as
ourselves
with
*NL*
the
same
kind
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
forth
a
phrase
from
his
treasure
and
spoke
it
softly
to
*NL*
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
day
of
dappled
seaborne
clouds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
phrase
and
the
day
and
the
scene
harmonized
in
a
chord
.
Words
.
Was
*NL*
it
their
colours
?
He
allowed
them
to
glow
and
fade
,
hue
after
hue
:
*NL*
sunrise
gold
,
the
russet
and
green
of
apple
orchards
,
azure
of
waves
,
*NL*
the
grey-fringed
fleece
of
clouds
.
No
,
it
was
not
their
colours
:
it
was
*NL*
the
poise
and
balance
of
the
period
itself
.
Did
he
then
love
the
*NL*
rhythmic
rise
and
fall
of
words
better
than
their
associations
of
*NL*
legend
and
colour
?
Or
was
it
that
,
being
as
weak
of
sight
as
he
was
shy
*NL*
of
mind
,
he
drew
less
pleasure
from
the
reflection
of
the
glowing
*NL*
sensible
world
through
the
prism
of
a
language
many-coloured
and
richly
*NL*
storied
than
from
the
contemplation
of
an
inner
world
of
individual
*NL*
emotions
mirrored
perfectly
in
a
lucid
supple
periodic
prose
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
from
the
trembling
bridge
on
to
firm
land
again
.
At
that
*NL*
instant
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
the
air
was
chilled
and
,
looking
askance
*NL*
towards
the
water
,
he
saw
a
flying
squall
darkening
and
crisping
*NL*
suddenly
the
tide
.
A
faint
click
at
his
heart
,
a
faint
throb
in
his
*NL*
throat
told
him
once
more
of
how
his
flesh
dreaded
the
cold
infrahuman
*NL*
odour
of
the
sea
;
yet
he
did
not
strike
across
the
downs
on
his
left
*NL*
but
held
straight
on
along
the
spine
of
rocks
that
pointed
against
the
*NL*
river
's
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
veiled
sunlight
lit
up
faintly
the
grey
sheet
of
water
where
the
*NL*
river
was
embayed
.
In
the
distance
along
the
course
of
the
slow-flowing
*NL*
Liffey
slender
masts
flecked
the
sky
and
,
more
distant
still
,
the
dim
*NL*
fabric
of
the
city
lay
prone
in
haze
.
Like
a
scene
on
some
vague
arras
,
*NL*
old
as
man
's
weariness
,
the
image
of
the
seventh
city
of
christendom
*NL*
was
visible
to
him
across
the
timeless
air
,
no
older
nor
more
weary
nor
*NL*
less
patient
of
subjection
than
in
the
days
of
the
thingmote
.
*NL*
*NL*
Disheartened
,
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
slow-drifting
clouds
,
*NL*
dappled
and
seaborne
.
They
were
voyaging
across
the
deserts
of
the
sky
,
*NL*
a
host
of
nomads
on
the
march
,
voyaging
high
over
Ireland
,
westward
*NL*
bound
.
The
Europe
they
had
come
from
lay
out
there
beyond
the
Irish
*NL*
Sea
,
Europe
of
strange
tongues
and
valleyed
and
woodbegirt
and
*NL*
citadelled
and
of
entrenched
and
marshalled
races
.
He
heard
a
confused
*NL*
music
within
him
as
of
memories
and
names
which
he
was
almost
conscious
*NL*
of
but
could
not
capture
even
for
an
instant
;
then
the
music
seemed
to
*NL*
recede
,
to
recede
,
to
recede
,
and
from
each
receding
trail
of
nebulous
*NL*
music
there
fell
always
one
longdrawn
calling
note
,
piercing
like
a
*NL*
star
the
dusk
of
silence
.
Again
!
Again
!
Again
!
A
voice
from
beyond
the
*NL*
world
was
calling
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hello
,
Stephanos
!
*NL*
*NL*
--

*NL*

for

*NL*
*NL*
--
Help

Help

...
Ao

*NL*
*NL*
He
recognized
their
speech
collectively
before
he
distinguished
their
*NL*
faces
.
The
mere
sight
of
that
medley
of
wet
nakedness
chilled
him
to
*NL*
the
bone
.
Their
bodies
,
corpse-white
or
suffused
with
a
pallid
golden
*NL*
light
or
rawly
tanned
by
the
sun
,
gleamed
with
the
wet
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
Their
diving-stone
,
poised
on
its
rude
supports
and
rocking
under
their
*NL*
plunges
,
and
the
rough-hewn
stones
of
the
sloping
breakwater
over
which
*NL*
they
scrambled
in
their
horseplay
gleamed
with
cold
wet
lustre
.
The
*NL*
towels
with
which
they
smacked
their
bodies
were
heavy
with
cold
*NL*
seawater
;
and
drenched
with
cold
brine
was
their
matted
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
still
in
deference
to
their
calls
and
parried
their
banter
*NL*
with
easy
words
.
How
characterless
they
looked
:
Shuley
without
his
deep
*NL*
unbuttoned
collar
,
Ennis
without
his
scarlet
belt
with
the
snaky
clasp
,
*NL*
and
Connolly
without
his
Norfolk
coat
with
the
flapless
side-pockets
!
*NL*
It
was
a
pain
to
see
them
,
and
a
sword-like
pain
to
see
the
signs
of
*NL*
adolescence
that
made
repellent
their
pitiable
nakedness
.
Perhaps
they
*NL*
had
taken
refuge
in
number
and
noise
from
the
secret
dread
in
their
*NL*
souls
.
But
he
,
apart
from
them
and
in
silence
,
remembered
in
what
dread
*NL*
he
stood
of
the
mystery
of
his
own
body
.

*NL*
Their
banter
was
not
new
to
him
and
now
it
flattered
his
mild
proud
*NL*
sovereignty
.
Now
,
as
never
before
,
his
strange
name
seemed
to
him
a
*NL*
prophecy
.
So
timeless
seemed
the
grey
warm
air
,
so
fluid
and
impersonal
*NL*
his
own
mood
,
that
all
ages
were
as
one
to
him
.
A
moment
before
the
*NL*
ghost
of
the
ancient
kingdom
of
the
Danes
had
looked
forth
through
the
*NL*
vesture
of
the
hazewrapped
City
.
Now
,
at
the
name
of
the
fabulous
*NL*
artificer
,
he
seemed
to
hear
the
noise
of
dim
waves
and
to
see
a
winged
*NL*
form
flying
above
the
waves
and
slowly
climbing
the
air
.
What
did
it
*NL*
mean
?
Was
it
a
quaint
device
opening
a
page
of
some
medieval
book
of
*NL*
prophecies
and
symbols
,
a
hawk-like
man
flying
sunward
above
the
sea
,
a
*NL*
prophecy
of
the
end
he
had
been
born
to
serve
and
had
been
following
*NL*
through
the
mists
of
childhood
and
boyhood
,
a
symbol
of
the
artist
*NL*
forging
anew
in
his
workshop
out
of
the
sluggish
matter
of
the
earth
a
*NL*
new
soaring
impalpable
imperishable
being
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
trembled
;
his
breath
came
faster
and
a
wild
spirit
passed
*NL*
over
his
limbs
as
though
he
was
soaring
sunward
.
His
heart
trembled
in
*NL*
an
ecstasy
of
fear
and
his
soul
was
in
flight
.
His
soul
was
soaring
in
*NL*
an
air
beyond
the
world
and
the
body
he
knew
was
purified
in
a
breath
*NL*
and
delivered
of
incertitude
and
made
radiant
and
commingled
with
the
*NL*
element
of
the
spirit
.
An
ecstasy
of
flight
made
radiant
his
eyes
and
*NL*
wild
his
breath
and
tremulous
and
wild
and
radiant
his
windswept
limbs
.

His
throat
ached
with
a
desire
to
cry
aloud
,
the
cry
of
a
hawk
or
eagle
*NL*
on
high
,
to
cry
piercingly
of
his
deliverance
to
the
winds
.
This
was
*NL*
the
call
of
life
to
his
soul
not
the
dull
gross
voice
of
the
world
of
*NL*
duties
and
despair
,
not
the
inhuman
voice
that
had
called
him
to
the
*NL*
pale
service
of
the
altar
.
An
instant
of
wild
flight
had
delivered
him
*NL*
and
the
cry
of
triumph
which
his
lips
withheld
cleft
his
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Stephaneforos
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
were
they
now
but
cerements
shaken
from
the
body
of
death
--
the
*NL*
fear
he
had
walked
in
night
and
day
,
the
incertitude
that
had
ringed
*NL*
him
round
,
the
shame
that
had
abased
him
within
and
without
--
cerements
,
*NL*
the
linens
of
the
grave
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
soul
had
arisen
from
the
grave
of
boyhood
,
spurning
her
*NL*
grave-clothes
.
Yes
!
Yes
!
Yes
!
He
would
create
proudly
out
of
the
*NL*
freedom
and
power
of
his
soul
,
as
the
great
artificer
whose
name
he
*NL*
bore
,
a
living
thing
,
new
and
soaring
and
beautiful
,
impalpable
,
*NL*
imperishable
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
up
nervously
from
the
stone-block
for
he
could
no
longer
*NL*
quench
the
flame
in
his
blood
.
He
felt
his
cheeks
aflame
and
his
throat
*NL*
throbbing
with
song
.
There
was
a
lust
of
wandering
in
his
feet
that
*NL*
burned
to
set
out
for
the
ends
of
the
earth
.
On
!
On
!
his
heart
seemed
*NL*
to
cry
.
Evening
would
deepen
above
the
sea
,
night
fall
upon
the
plains
,
*NL*
dawn
glimmer
before
the
wanderer
and
show
him
strange
fields
and
hills
*NL*
and
faces
.
Where
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
northward
towards
Howth
.
The
sea
had
fallen
below
the
line
of
*NL*
seawrack
on
the
shallow
side
of
the
breakwater
and
already
the
tide
was
*NL*
running
out
fast
along
the
foreshore
.
Already
one
long
oval
bank
of
*NL*
sand
lay
warm
and
dry
amid
the
wavelets
.
Here
and
there
warm
isles
of
*NL*
sand
gleamed
above
the
shallow
tide
and
about
the
isles
and
around
the
*NL*
long
bank
and
amid
the
shallow
currents
of
the
beach
were
lightclad
*NL*
figures
,
wading
and
delving
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
moments
he
was
barefoot
,
his
stockings
folded
in
his
pockets
*NL*
and
his
canvas
shoes
dangling
by
their
knotted
laces
over
his
shoulders
*NL*
and
,
picking
a
pointed
salt-eaten
stick
out
of
the
jetsam
among
the
*NL*
rocks
,
he
clambered
down
the
slope
of
the
breakwater
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
rivulet
in
the
strand
and
,
as
he
waded
slowly
up
its
*NL*
course
,
he
wondered
at
the
endless
drift
of
seaweed
.
Emerald
and
black
*NL*
and
russet
and
olive
,
it
moved
beneath
the
current
,
swaying
and
*NL*
turning
.
The
water
of
the
rivulet
was
dark
with
endless
drift
and
*NL*
mirrored
the
high-drifting
clouds
.
The
clouds
were
drifting
above
him
*NL*
silently
and
silently
the
seatangle
was
drifting
below
him
and
the
grey
*NL*
warm
air
was
still
and
a
new
wild
life
was
singing
in
his
veins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
was
his
boyhood
now
?
Where
was
the
soul
that
had
hung
back
from
*NL*
her
destiny
,
to
brood
alone
upon
the
shame
of
her
wounds
and
in
her
*NL*
house
of
squalor
and
subterfuge
to
queen
it
in
faded
cerements
and
in
*NL*
wreaths
that
withered
at
the
touch
?
Or
where
was
he
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
alone
.
He
was
unheeded
,
happy
and
near
to
the
wild
heart
of
*NL*
life
.
He
was
alone
and
young
and
wilful
and
wildhearted
,
alone
amid
a
*NL*
waste
of
wild
air
and
brackish
waters
and
the
sea-harvest
of
shells
and
*NL*
tangle
and
veiled
grey
sunlight
and
gayclad
lightclad
figures
of
*NL*
children
and
girls
and
voices
childish
and
girlish
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
girl
stood
before
him
in
midstream
,
alone
and
still
,
gazing
out
to
*NL*
sea
.
She
seemed
like
one
whom
magic
had
changed
into
the
likeness
of
a
*NL*
strange
and
beautiful
seabird
.
Her
long
slender
bare
legs
were
delicate
*NL*
as
a
crane
's
and
pure
save
where
an
emerald
trail
of
seaweed
had
*NL*
fashioned
itself
as
a
sign
upon
the
flesh
.
Her
thighs
,
fuller
and
*NL*
soft-hued
as
ivory
,
were
bared
almost
to
the
hips
,
where
the
white
*NL*
fringes
of
her
drawers
were
like
feathering
of
soft
white
down
.
Her
*NL*
slate-blue
skirts
were
kilted
boldly
about
her
waist
and
dovetailed
*NL*
behind
her
.
Her
bosom
was
as
a
bird
's
,
soft
and
slight
,
slight
and
soft
*NL*
as
the
breast
of
some
dark-plumaged
dove
.
But
her
long
fair
hair
was
*NL*
girlish
:
and
girlish
,
and
touched
with
the
wonder
of
mortal
beauty
,
her
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
alone
and
still
,
gazing
out
to
sea
;
and
when
she
felt
his
*NL*
presence
and
the
worship
of
his
eyes
her
eyes
turned
to
him
in
quiet
*NL*
sufferance
of
his
gaze
,
without
shame
or
wantonness
.
Long
,
long
she
*NL*
suffered
his
gaze
and
then
quietly
withdrew
her
eyes
from
his
and
bent
*NL*
them
towards
the
stream
,
gently
stirring
the
water
with
her
foot
hither
*NL*
and
thither
.
The
first
faint
noise
of
gently
moving
water
broke
the
*NL*
silence
,
low
and
faint
and
whispering
,
faint
as
the
bells
of
sleep
;
*NL*
hither
and
thither
,
hither
and
thither
;
and
a
faint
flame
trembled
on
*NL*
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Heavenly
God
!
cried
Stephen
's
soul
,
in
an
outburst
of
profane
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
from
her
suddenly
and
set
off
across
the
strand
.
His
*NL*
cheeks
were
aflame
;
his
body
was
aglow
;
his
limbs
were
trembling
.
On
*NL*
and
on
and
on
and
on
he
strode
,
far
out
over
the
sands
,
singing
wildly
*NL*
to
the
sea
,
crying
to
greet
the
advent
of
the
life
that
had
cried
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
image
had
passed
into
his
soul
for
ever
and
no
word
had
broken
the
*NL*
holy
silence
of
his
ecstasy
.
Her
eyes
had
called
him
and
his
soul
had
*NL*
leaped
at
the
call
.
To
live
,
to
err
,
to
fall
,
to
triumph
,
to
recreate
*NL*
life
out
of
life
!
A
wild
angel
had
appeared
to
him
,
the
angel
of
mortal
*NL*
youth
and
beauty
,
an
envoy
from
the
fair
courts
of
life
,
to
throw
open
*NL*
before
him
in
an
instant
of
ecstasy
the
gates
of
all
the
ways
of
error
*NL*
and
glory
.
On
and
on
and
on
and
on
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
halted
suddenly
and
heard
his
heart
in
the
silence
.
How
far
had
he
*NL*
walked
?
What
hour
was
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
human
figure
near
him
nor
any
sound
borne
to
him
over
the
*NL*
air
.
But
the
tide
was
near
the
turn
and
already
the
day
was
on
the
*NL*
wane
.
He
turned
landward
and
ran
towards
the
shore
and
,
running
up
the
*NL*
sloping
beach
,
reckless
of
the
sharp
shingle
,
found
a
sandy
nook
amid
a
*NL*
ring
of
tufted
sandknolls
and
lay
down
there
that
the
peace
and
silence
*NL*
of
the
evening
might
still
the
riot
of
his
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
above
him
the
vast
indifferent
dome
and
the
calm
processes
of
*NL*
the
heavenly
bodies
;
and
the
earth
beneath
him
,
the
earth
that
had
*NL*
borne
him
,
had
taken
him
to
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
eyes
in
the
languor
of
sleep
.
His
eyelids
trembled
as
if
*NL*
they
felt
the
vast
cyclic
movement
of
the
earth
and
her
watchers
,
*NL*
trembled
as
if
they
felt
the
strange
light
of
some
new
world
.
His
soul
*NL*
was
swooning
into
some
new
world
,
fantastic
,
dim
,
uncertain
as
under
*NL*
sea
,
traversed
by
cloudy
shapes
and
beings
.
A
world
,
a
glimmer
or
a
*NL*
flower
?
Glimmering
and
trembling
,
trembling
and
unfolding
,
a
breaking
*NL*
light
,
an
opening
flower
,
it
spread
in
endless
succession
to
itself
,
*NL*
breaking
in
full
crimson
and
unfolding
and
fading
to
palest
rose
,
leaf
*NL*
by
leaf
and
wave
of
light
by
wave
of
light
,
flooding
all
the
heavens
*NL*
with
its
soft
flushes
,
every
flush
deeper
than
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
had
fallen
when
he
woke
and
the
sand
and
arid
grasses
of
his
*NL*
bed
glowed
no
longer
.
He
rose
slowly
and
,
recalling
the
rapture
of
his
*NL*
sleep
,
sighed
at
its
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
climbed
to
the
crest
of
the
sandhill
and
gazed
about
him
.
Evening
*NL*
had
fallen
.
A
rim
of
the
young
moon
cleft
the
pale
waste
of
skyline
,
*NL*
the
rim
of
a
silver
hoop
embedded
in
grey
sand
;
and
the
tide
was
*NL*
flowing
in
fast
to
the
land
with
a
low
whisper
of
her
waves
,
islanding
*NL*
a
few
last
figures
in
distant
pools
.

He
drained
his

to
the
dregs
and
set
to
chewing
*NL*
the
crusts
of
fried
bread
that
were
scattered
near
him
,
staring
into
*NL*
the
dark
pool
of
the
jar
.
The
yellow
dripping
had
been
scooped
out
like
*NL*
a
boghole
and
the
pool
under
it
brought
back
to
his
memory
the
dark
*NL*
turf-coloured
water
of
the
bath
in
Clongowes
.
The
box
of
pawn
tickets
*NL*
at
his
elbow
had
just
been
rifled
and
he
took
up
idly
one
after
another
*NL*
in
his
greasy
fingers
the
blue
and
white
dockets
,
scrawled
and
sanded
*NL*
and
creased
and
bearing

Then
he
put
them
aside
and
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
lid
of
the
box
,
*NL*
speckled
with
louse
marks
,
and
asked
vaguely
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
How

*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
straightened
the
battered
alarm
clock
that
was
lying
on
its
*NL*
side
in
the
middle
of
the
mantelpiece
until
its
dial
showed
a
quarter
*NL*
to
twelve
and
then
laid
it
once
more
on
its
side
.
*NL*

said

the

into

into

has
to
wash
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
it
gives
you
pleasure
,
said
Stephen
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
ear-splitting
whistle
was
heard
from
upstairs
and
his
mother
thrust
*NL*
a
damp
overall
into
his
hands
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dry
yourself
and
hurry
out
for
the
love
of
goodness
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
shrill
whistle
,
prolonged
angrily
,
brought
one
of
the
girls
to
*NL*
the
foot
of
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
father
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
your
lazy
bitch
of
a
brother
gone
out
yet
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sure
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hm
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
came
back
,
making
signs
to
him
to
be
quick
and
go
out
quietly
*NL*
by
the
back
.
Stephen
laughed
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
has
a
curious
idea
of
genders
if
he
thinks
a
bitch
is
masculine
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
,
it
's
a
scandalous
shame
for
you
,
Stephen
,
said
his
mother
,
and
*NL*
you
'll
live
to
rue
the
day
you
set
your
foot
in
that
place
.
I
know
how
*NL*
it
has
changed
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
morning
,
everybody
,
said
Stephen
,
smiling
and
kissing
the
tips
*NL*
of
his
fingers
in
adieu
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lane
behind
the
terrace
was
waterlogged
and
as
he
went
down
it
*NL*
slowly
,
choosing
his
steps
amid
heaps
of
wet
rubbish
,
he
heard
a
mad
*NL*
nun
screeching
in
the
nuns
'
madhouse
beyond
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Jesus
!
O
Jesus
!
Jesus
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
the
sound
out
of
his
ears
by
an
angry
toss
of
his
head
and
*NL*
hurried
on
,
stumbling
through
the
mouldering
offal
,
his
heart
already
*NL*
bitten
by
an
ache
of
loathing
and
bitterness
.
His
father
's
whistle
,
his
*NL*
mother
's
mutterings
,
the
screech
of
an
unseen
maniac
were
to
him
now
so
*NL*
many
voices
offending
and
threatening
to
humble
the
pride
of
his
youth
.
*NL*
He
drove
their
echoes
even
out
of
his
heart
with
an
execration
;
but
,
as
*NL*
he
walked
down
the
avenue
and
felt
the
grey
morning
light
falling
about
*NL*
him
through
the
dripping
trees
and
smelt
the
strange
wild
smell
of
the
*NL*
wet
leaves
and
bark
,
his
soul
was
loosed
of
her
miseries
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain-laden
trees
of
the
avenue
evoked
in
him
,
as
always
,
memories
*NL*
of
the
girls
and
women
in
the
plays
of
Gerhart
Hauptmann
;
and
the
*NL*
memory
of
their
pale
sorrows
and
the
fragrance
falling
from
the
wet
*NL*
branches
mingled
in
a
mood
of
quiet
joy
.
His
morning
walk
across
the
*NL*
city
had
begun
,
and
he
foreknew
that
as
he
passed
the
sloblands
of
*NL*
Fairview
he
would
think
of
the
cloistral
silver-veined
prose
of
Newman
;
*NL*
that
as
he
walked
along
the
North
Strand
Road
,
glancing
idly
at
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
provision
shops
,
he
would
recall
the
dark
humour
of
*NL*
Guido
Cavalcanti
and
smile
;
that
as
he
went
by
Baird
's
stonecutting
*NL*
works
in
Talbot
Place
the
spirit
of
Ibsen
would
blow
through
him
like
a
*NL*
keen
wind
,
a
spirit
of
wayward
boyish
beauty
;
and
that
passing
a
grimy
*NL*
marine
dealer
's
shop
beyond
the
Liffey
he
would
repeat
the
song
by
Ben
*NL*
Jonson
which
begins
:
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
wearier
where
I
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
when
wearied
of
its
search
for
the
essence
of
beauty
amid
the
*NL*
spectral
words
of
Aristotle
or
Aquinas
turned
often
for
its
pleasure
to
*NL*
the
dainty
songs
of
the
Elizabethans
.
His
mind
,
in
the
vesture
of
a
*NL*
doubting
monk
,
stood
often
in
shadow
under
the
windows
of
that
age
,
to
*NL*
hear
the
grave
and
mocking
music
of
the
lutenists
or
the
frank
laughter
*NL*
of
waist-coateers
until
a
laugh
too
low
,
a
phrase
,
tarnished
by
time
,
*NL*
of
chambering
and
false
honour
stung
his
monkish
pride
and
drove
him
on
*NL*
from
his
lurking-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lore
which
he
was
believed
to
pass
his
days
brooding
upon
so
that
*NL*
it
had
rapt
him
from
the
companionship
of
youth
was
only
a
garner
of
*NL*
slender
sentences
from
Aristotle
's
poetics
and
psychology
and
a
*NL*
SYNOPSIS
PHILOSOPHIAE
SCHOLASTICAE
AD
MENTEM
DIVI
THOMAE
.
His
thinking
*NL*
was
a
dusk
of
doubt
and
self-mistrust
,
lit
up
at
moments
by
the
*NL*
lightnings
of
intuition
,
but
lightnings
of
so
clear
a
splendour
that
in
*NL*
those
moments
the
world
perished
about
his
feet
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
fire-consumed
;
and
thereafter
his
tongue
grew
heavy
and
he
met
the
eyes
*NL*
of
others
with
unanswering
eyes
,
for
he
felt
that
the
spirit
of
beauty
*NL*
had
folded
him
round
like
a
mantle
and
that
in
revery
at
least
he
had
*NL*
been
acquainted
with
nobility
.
But
when
this
brief
pride
of
*NL*
silence
upheld
him
no
longer
he
was
glad
to
find
himself
*NL*
still
in
the
midst
of
common
lives
,
passing
on
his
way
amid
the
squalor
*NL*
and
noise
and
sloth
of
the
city
fearlessly
and
with
a
light
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
hoardings
on
the
canal
he
met
the
consumptive
man
with
the
*NL*
doll
's
face
and
the
brimless
hat
coming
towards
him
down
the
slope
of
*NL*
the
bridge
with
little
steps
,
tightly
buttoned
into
his
chocolate
*NL*
overcoat
,
and
holding
his
furled
umbrella
a
span
or
two
from
him
like
a
*NL*
divining
rod
.
It
must
be
eleven
,
he
thought
,
and
peered
into
a
dairy
to
*NL*
see
the
time
.
The
clock
in
the
dairy
told
him
that
it
was
five
minutes
*NL*
to
five
but
,
as
he
turned
away
,
he
heard
a
clock
somewhere
near
him
,
*NL*
but
unseen
,
beating
eleven
strokes
in
swift
precision
.
He
laughed
as
he
*NL*
heard
it
for
it
made
him
think
of
McCann
,
and
he
saw
him
a
squat
figure
*NL*
in
a
shooting
jacket
and
breeches
and
with
a
fair
goatee
,
standing
in
*NL*
the
wind
at
Hopkins
'
corner
,
and
heard
him
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dedalus
,
you
're
an
antisocial
being
,
wrapped
up
in
yourself
.
I
'm
*NL*
not
.
I
'm
a
democrat
and
I
'll
work
and
act
for
social
liberty
and
*NL*
equality
among
all
classes
and
sexes
in
the
United
States
of
the
Europe
*NL*
of
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eleven
!
Then
he
was
late
for
that
lecture
too
.
What
day
of
the
week
was
*NL*
it
?
He
stopped
at
a
newsagent
's
to
read
the
headline
of
a
placard
.
*NL*
Thursday
.
Ten
to
eleven
,
English
;
eleven
to
twelve
,
French
;
twelve
to
*NL*
one
,
physics
.
He
fancied
to
himself
the
English
lecture
and
felt
,
even
*NL*
at
that
distance
,
restless
and
helpless
.
He
saw
the
heads
of
his
*NL*
classmates
meekly
bent
as
they
wrote
in
their
notebooks
the
points
they
*NL*
were
bidden
to
note
,
nominal
definitions
,
essential
definitions
and
*NL*
examples
or
dates
of
birth
or
death
,
chief
works
,
a
favourable
and
an
*NL*
unfavourable
criticism
side
by
side
.
His
own
head
was
unbent
for
his
*NL*
thoughts
wandered
abroad
and
whether
he
looked
around
the
little
class
*NL*
of
students
or
out
of
the
window
across
the
desolate
gardens
of
the
*NL*
green
an
odour
assailed
him
of
cheerless
cellar-damp
and
decay
.
Another
*NL*
head
than
his
,
right
before
him
in
the
first
benches
,
was
poised
*NL*
squarely
above
its
bending
fellows
like
the
head
of
a
priest
appealing
*NL*
without
humility
to
the
tabernacle
for
the
humble
worshippers
about
*NL*
him
.
Why
was
it
that
when
he
thought
of
Cranly
he
could
never
raise
*NL*
before
his
mind
the
entire
image
of
his
body
but
only
the
image
of
the
*NL*
head
and
face
?
Even
now
against
the
grey
curtain
of
the
morning
he
saw
*NL*
it
before
him
like
the
phantom
of
a
dream
,
the
face
of
a
severed
head
*NL*
or
death-mask
,
crowned
on
the
brows
by
its
stiff
black
upright
hair
as
*NL*
by
an
iron
crown
.
It
was
a
priest-like
face
,
priest-like
in
its
palor
,
*NL*
in
the
wide
winged
nose
,
in
the
shadowings
below
the
eyes
and
along
the
*NL*
jaws
,
priest-like
in
the
lips
that
were
long
and
bloodless
and
faintly
*NL*
smiling
;
and
Stephen
,
remembering
swiftly
how
he
had
told
Cranly
of
all
*NL*
the
tumults
and
unrest
and
longings
in
his
soul
,
day
after
day
and
*NL*
night
by
night
,
only
to
be
answered
by
his
friend
's
listening
silence
,
*NL*
would
have
told
himself
that
it
was
the
face
of
a
guilty
priest
who
*NL*
heard
confessions
of
those
whom
he
had
not
power
to
absolve
but
that
he
*NL*
felt
again
in
memory
the
gaze
of
its
dark
womanish
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
this
image
he
had
a
glimpse
of
a
strange
dark
cavern
of
*NL*
speculation
but
at
once
turned
away
from
it
,
feeling
that
it
was
not
*NL*
yet
the
hour
to
enter
it
.
But
the
nightshade
of
his
friend
's
*NL*
listlessness
seemed
to
be
diffusing
in
the
air
around
him
a
tenuous
and
*NL*
deadly
exhalation
and
he
found
himself
glancing
from
one
casual
word
to
*NL*
another
on
his
right
or
left
in
stolid
wonder
that
they
had
been
so
*NL*
silently
emptied
of
instantaneous
sense
until
every
mean
shop
legend
*NL*
bound
his
mind
like
the
words
of
a
spell
and
his
soul
shrivelled
up
*NL*
sighing
with
age
as
he
walked
on
in
a
lane
among
heaps
of
dead
*NL*
language
.
His
own
consciousness
of
language
was
ebbing
from
his
brain
*NL*
and
trickling
into
the
very
words
themselves
which
set
to
band
and
*NL*
disband
themselves
in
wayward
rhythms
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
ivy
whines
upon
the
wall
,
*NL*
And
whines
and
twines
upon
the
wall
,
*NL*
The
yellow
ivy
upon
the
wall
,
*NL*
Ivy
,
ivy
up
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
anyone
ever
hear
such
drivel
?
Lord
Almighty
!
Who
ever
heard
of
ivy
*NL*
whining
on
a
wall
?
Yellow
ivy
;
that
was
all
right
.
Yellow
ivory
also
.
*NL*
And
what
about
ivory
ivy
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
now
shone
in
his
brain
,
clearer
and
brighter
than
any
ivory
*NL*
sawn
from
the
mottled
tusks
of
elephants
.
IVORY
,
IVOIRE
,
AVORIO
,
EBUR
.
*NL*
One
of
the
first
examples
that
he
had
learnt
in
Latin
had
run
:
*NL*
INDIA
MITTIT
EBUR
;
and
he
recalled
the
shrewd
northern
face
of
the
*NL*
rector
who
had
taught
him
to
construe
the
Metamorphoses
of
Ovid
in
a
*NL*
courtly
English
,
made
whimsical
by
the
mention
of
porkers
and
potsherds
*NL*
and
chines
of
bacon
.
He
had
learnt
what
little
he
knew
of
the
laws
of
*NL*
Latin
verse
from
a
ragged
book
written
by
a
Portuguese
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Contrahit
orator
,
variant
in
carmine
vates
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crises
and
victories
and
secessions
in
Roman
history
were
handed
on
*NL*
to
him
in
the
trite
words
IN
TANTO
DISCRIMINE
and
he
had
tried
to
peer
*NL*
into
the
social
life
of
the
city
of
cities
through
the
words
IMPLERE
*NL*
OLLAM
DENARIORUM
which
the
rector
had
rendered
sonorously
as
the
*NL*
filling
of
a
pot
with
denaries
.
The
pages
of
his
time-worn
Horace
never
*NL*
felt
cold
to
the
touch
even
when
his
own
fingers
were
cold
;
they
were
*NL*
human
pages
and
fifty
years
before
they
had
been
turned
by
the
human
*NL*
fingers
of
John
Duncan
Inverarity
and
by
his
brother
,
William
Malcolm
*NL*
Inverarity
.
Yes
,
those
were
noble
names
on
the
dusky
flyleaf
and
,
even
*NL*
for
so
poor
a
Latinist
as
he
,
the
dusky
verses
were
as
fragrant
as
*NL*
though
they
had
lain
all
those
years
in
myrtle
and
lavender
and
*NL*
vervain
;
but
yet
it
wounded
him
to
think
that
he
would
never
be
but
a
*NL*
shy
guest
at
the
feast
of
the
world
's
culture
and
that
the
monkish
*NL*
learning
,
in
terms
of
which
he
was
striving
to
forge
out
an
esthetic
*NL*
philosophy
,
was
held
no
higher
by
the
age
he
lived
in
than
the
subtle
*NL*
and
curious
jargons
of
heraldry
and
falconry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grey
block
of
Trinity
on
his
left
,
set
heavily
in
the
city
's
*NL*
ignorance
like
a
dull
stone
set
in
a
cumbrous
ring
,
pulled
his
mind
*NL*
downward
and
while
he
was
striving
this
way
and
that
to
free
his
feet
*NL*
from
the
fetters
of
the
reformed
conscience
he
came
upon
the
droll
*NL*
statue
of
the
national
poet
of
Ireland
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
it
without
anger
;
for
,
though
sloth
of
the
body
and
of
the
*NL*
soul
crept
over
it
like
unseen
vermin
,
over
the
shuffling
feet
and
up
*NL*
the
folds
of
the
cloak
and
around
the
servile
head
,
it
seemed
humbly
*NL*
conscious
of
its
indignity
.
It
was
a
Firbolg
in
the
borrowed
cloak
of
a
*NL*
Milesian
;
and
he
thought
of
his
friend
Davin
,
the
peasant
student
.
It
*NL*
was
a
jesting
name
between
them
,
but
the
young
peasant
bore
with
it
*NL*
lightly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Go
on
,
Stevie
,
I
have
a
hard
head
,
you
tell
me
.
Call
me
what
you
*NL*
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
homely
version
of
his
christian
name
on
the
lips
of
his
friend
had
*NL*
touched
Stephen
pleasantly
when
first
heard
for
he
was
as
formal
in
*NL*
speech
with
others
as
they
were
with
him
.
Often
,
as
he
sat
in
Davin
's
*NL*
rooms
in
Grantham
Street
,
wondering
at
his
friend
's
well-made
boots
*NL*
that
flanked
the
wall
pair
by
pair
and
repeating
for
his
friend
's
*NL*
simple
ear
the
verses
and
cadences
of
others
which
were
the
veils
of
*NL*
his
own
longing
and
dejection
,
the
rude
Firbolg
mind
of
his
listener
*NL*
had
drawn
his
mind
towards
it
and
flung
it
back
again
,
drawing
it
by
a
*NL*
quiet
inbred
courtesy
of
attention
or
by
a
quaint
turn
of
old
English
*NL*
speech
or
by
the
force
of
its
delight
in
rude
bodily
skill
--
for
Davin
*NL*
had
sat
at
the
feet
of
Michael
Cusack
,
the
Gael
--
repelling
swiftly
and
*NL*
suddenly
by
a
grossness
of
intelligence
or
by
a
bluntness
of
feeling
or
*NL*
by
a
dull
stare
of
terror
in
the
eyes
,
the
terror
of
soul
of
a
starving
*NL*
Irish
village
in
which
the
curfew
was
still
a
nightly
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Side
by
side
with
his
memory
of
the
deeds
of
prowess
of
his
uncle
Mat
*NL*
Davin
,
the
athlete
,
the
young
peasant
worshipped
the
sorrowful
legend
*NL*
of
Ireland
.
The
gossip
of
his
fellow-students
which
strove
to
render
*NL*
the
flat
life
of
the
college
significant
at
any
cost
loved
to
think
of
*NL*
him
as
a
young
fenian
.
His
nurse
had
taught
him
Irish
and
shaped
his
*NL*
rude
imagination
by
the
broken
lights
of
Irish
myth
.
He
stood
towards
*NL*
the
myth
upon
which
no
individual
mind
had
ever
drawn
out
a
line
of
*NL*
beauty
and
to
its
unwieldy
tales
that
divided
against
themselves
as
*NL*
they
moved
down
the
cycles
in
the
same
attitude
as
towards
the
Roman
*NL*
catholic
religion
,
the
attitude
of
a
dull-witted
loyal
serf
.
Whatsoever
*NL*
of
thought
or
of
feeling
came
to
him
from
England
or
by
way
of
English
*NL*
culture
his
mind
stood
armed
against
in
obedience
to
a
password
;
and
of
*NL*
the
world
that
lay
beyond
England
he
knew
only
the
foreign
legion
of
*NL*
France
in
which
he
spoke
of
serving
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coupling
this
ambition
with
the
young
man
's
humour
Stephen
had
often
*NL*
called
him
one
of
the
tame
geese
and
there
was
even
a
point
of
*NL*
irritation
in
the
name
pointed
against
that
very
reluctance
of
speech
*NL*
and
deed
in
his
friend
which
seemed
so
often
to
stand
between
Stephen
's
*NL*
mind
,
eager
of
speculation
,
and
the
hidden
ways
of
Irish
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
the
young
peasant
,
his
spirit
stung
by
the
violent
or
*NL*
luxurious
language
in
which
Stephen
escaped
from
the
cold
silence
of
*NL*
intellectual
revolt
,
had
called
up
before
Stephen
's
mind
a
strange
*NL*
vision
.
The
two
were
walking
slowly
towards
Davin
's
rooms
through
the
*NL*
dark
narrow
streets
of
the
poorer
jews
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
thing
happened
to
myself
,
Stevie
,
last
autumn
,
coming
on
winter
,
*NL*
and
I
never
told
it
to
a
living
soul
and
you
are
the
first
person
now
I
*NL*
ever
told
it
to
.
I
disremember
if
it
was
October
or
November
.
It
was
*NL*
October
because
it
was
before
I
came
up
here
to
join
the
matriculation
*NL*
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
had
turned
his
smiling
eyes
towards
his
friend
's
face
,
*NL*
flattered
by
his
confidence
and
won
over
to
sympathy
by
the
speaker
's
*NL*
simple
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
was
away
all
that
day
from
my
own
place
over
in
Buttevant
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
n't
know
if
you
know
where
that
is
--
at
a
hurling
match
between
*NL*
the
Croke
's
Own
Boys
and
the
Fearless
Thurles
and
by
God
,
Stevie
,
that
*NL*
was
the
hard
fight
.
My
first
cousin
,
Fonsy
Davin
,
was
stripped
to
his
*NL*
buff
that
day
minding
cool
for
the
Limericks
but
he
was
up
with
the
*NL*
forwards
half
the
time
and
shouting
like
mad
.
I
never
will
forget
that
*NL*
day
.
One
of
the
Crokes
made
a
woeful
wipe
at
him
one
time
with
his
*NL*
caman
and
I
declare
to
God
he
was
within
an
aim
's
ace
of
getting
it
at
*NL*
the
side
of
his
temple
.
Oh
,
honest
to
God
,
if
the
crook
of
it
caught
*NL*
him
that
time
he
was
done
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
glad
he
escaped
,
Stephen
had
said
with
a
laugh
,
but
surely
*NL*
that
's
not
the
strange
thing
that
happened
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
I
suppose
that
does
n't
interest
you
,
but
leastways
there
was
*NL*
such
noise
after
the
match
that
I
missed
the
train
home
and
I
could
n't
*NL*
get
any
kind
of
a
yoke
to
give
me
a
lift
for
,
as
luck
would
have
it
,
*NL*
there
was
a
mass
meeting
that
same
day
over
in
Castletownroche
and
*NL*
all
the
cars
in
the
country
were
there
.
So
there
was
nothing
for
it
*NL*
only
to
stay
the
night
or
to
foot
it
out
.
Well
,
I
started
to
walk
*NL*
and
on
I
went
and
it
was
coming
on
night
when
I
got
into
the
Ballyhoura
*NL*
hills
,
that
's
better
than
ten
miles
from
Kilmallock
and
there
's
a
*NL*
long
lonely
road
after
that
.
You
would
n't
see
the
sign
of
a
christian
*NL*
house
along
the
road
or
hear
a
sound
.
It
was
pitch
dark
almost
.
Once
*NL*
or
twice
I
stopped
by
the
way
under
a
bush
to
redden
my
pipe
and
only
*NL*
for
the
dew
was
thick
I
'd
have
stretched
out
there
and
slept
.
At
last
,
*NL*
after
a
bend
of
the
road
,
I
spied
a
little
cottage
with
a
light
in
the
*NL*
window
.
I
went
up
and
knocked
at
the
door
.
A
voice
asked
who
was
*NL*
there
and
I
answered
I
was
over
at
the
match
in
Buttevant
and
was
*NL*
walking
back
and
that
I
'd
be
thankful
for
a
glass
of
water
.
After
*NL*
a
while
a
young
woman
opened
the
door
and
brought
me
out
a
big
mug
*NL*
of
milk
.
She
was
half
undressed
as
if
she
was
going
to
bed
when
I
*NL*
knocked
and
she
had
her
hair
hanging
and
I
thought
by
her
figure
and
*NL*
by
something
in
the
look
of
her
eyes
that
she
must
be
carrying
a
*NL*
child
.
She
kept
me
in
talk
a
long
while
at
the
door
,
and
I
thought
*NL*
it
strange
because
her
breast
and
her
shoulders
were
bare
.
She
*NL*
asked
me
was
I
tired
and
would
I
like
to
stop
the
night
there
.
*NL*
She
said
she
was
all
alone
in
the
house
and
that
her
husband
had
*NL*
gone
that
morning
to
Queenstown
with
his
sister
to
see
her
off
.
And
all
*NL*
the
time
she
was
talking
,
Stevie
,
she
had
her
eyes
fixed
on
my
face
and
*NL*
she
stood
so
close
to
me
I
could
hear
her
breathing
.
When
I
handed
her
*NL*
back
the
mug
at
last
she
took
my
hand
to
draw
me
in
over
the
threshold
*NL*
and
said
:
`
COME
IN
AND
STAY
THE
NIGHT
HERE
.
YOU
'VE
NO
CALL
TO
BE
*NL*
FRIGHTENED
.
THERE
'S
NO
ONE
IN
IT
BUT
OURSELVES
...
'
I
did
n't
go
in
,
*NL*
Stevie
.
I
thanked
her
and
went
on
my
way
again
,
all
in
a
fever
.
At
the
*NL*
first
bend
of
the
road
I
looked
back
and
she
was
standing
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
words
of
Davin
's
story
sang
in
his
memory
and
the
figure
of
*NL*
the
woman
in
the
story
stood
forth
reflected
in
other
figures
of
the
*NL*
peasant
women
whom
he
had
seen
standing
in
the
doorways
at
Clane
as
the
*NL*
college
cars
drove
by
,
as
a
type
of
her
race
and
of
his
own
,
a
bat-like
*NL*
soul
waking
to
the
consciousness
of
itself
in
darkness
and
secrecy
and
*NL*
loneliness
and
,
through
the
eyes
and
voice
and
gesture
of
a
woman
*NL*
without
guile
,
calling
the
stranger
to
her
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hand
was
laid
on
his
arm
and
a
young
voice
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
,
gentleman
,
your
own
girl
,
sir
!
The
first
handsel
today
,
gentleman
.
*NL*
Buy
that
lovely
bunch
.
Will
you
,
gentleman
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
blue
flowers
which
she
lifted
towards
him
and
her
young
blue
eyes
*NL*
seemed
to
him
at
that
instant
images
of
guilelessness
,
and
he
halted
*NL*
till
the
image
had
vanished
and
he
saw
only
her
ragged
dress
and
damp
*NL*
coarse
hair
and
hoydenish
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
,
gentleman
!
Do
n't
forget
your
own
girl
,
sir
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
no
money
,
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Buy
them
lovely
ones
,
will
you
,
sir
?
Only
a
penny
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
you
hear
what
I
said
?
asked
Stephen
,
bending
towards
her
.
I
told
you
*NL*
I
had
no
money
.
I
tell
you
again
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
sure
,
you
will
some
day
,
sir
,
please
God
,
the
girl
answered
*NL*
after
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Possibly
,
said
Stephen
,
but
I
do
n't
think
it
likely
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
her
quickly
,
fearing
that
her
intimacy
might
turn
to
jibing
*NL*
and
wishing
to
be
out
of
the
way
before
she
offered
her
ware
to
*NL*
another
,
a
tourist
from
England
or
a
student
of
Trinity
.
Grafton
*NL*
Street
,
along
which
he
walked
,
prolonged
that
moment
of
discouraged
*NL*
poverty
.
In
the
roadway
at
the
head
of
the
street
a
slab
was
set
to
the
*NL*
memory
of
Wolfe
Tone
and
he
remembered
having
been
present
with
his
*NL*
father
at
its
laying
.
He
remembered
with
bitterness
that
scene
of
*NL*
tawdry
tribute
.
There
were
four
French
delegates
in
a
brake
and
one
,
a
*NL*
plump
smiling
young
man
,
held
,
wedged
on
a
stick
,
a
card
on
which
were
*NL*
printed
the
words
:
VIVE
L'IRLANDE
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
trees
in
Stephen
's
Green
were
fragrant
of
rain
and
the
*NL*
rain-sodden
earth
gave
forth
its
mortal
odour
,
a
faint
incense
rising
*NL*
upward
through
the
mould
from
many
hearts
.
The
soul
of
the
gallant
*NL*
venal
city
which
his
elders
had
told
him
of
had
shrunk
with
time
to
a
*NL*
faint
mortal
odour
rising
from
the
earth
and
he
knew
that
in
a
moment
*NL*
when
he
entered
the
sombre
college
he
would
be
conscious
of
a
*NL*
corruption
other
than
that
of
Buck
Egan
and
Burnchapel
Whaley
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
too
late
to
go
upstairs
to
the
French
class
.
He
crossed
the
hall
*NL*
and
took
the
corridor
to
the
left
which
led
to
the
physics
theatre
.
The
*NL*
corridor
was
dark
and
silent
but
not
unwatchful
.
Why
did
he
feel
that
*NL*
it
was
not
unwatchful
?
Was
it
because
he
had
heard
that
in
Buck
*NL*
Whaley
's
time
there
was
a
secret
staircase
there
?
Or
was
the
jesuit
*NL*
house
extra-territorial
and
was
he
walking
among
aliens
?
The
Ireland
of
*NL*
Tone
and
of
Parnell
seemed
to
have
receded
in
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
the
door
of
the
theatre
and
halted
in
the
chilly
grey
light
*NL*
that
struggled
through
the
dusty
windows
.
A
figure
was
crouching
before
*NL*
the
large
grate
and
by
its
leanness
and
greyness
he
knew
that
it
was
*NL*
the
dean
of
studies
lighting
the
fire
.
Stephen
closed
the
door
quietly
*NL*
and
approached
the
fireplace
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
morning
,
sir
!
Can
I
help
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
looked
up
quickly
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
One
moment
now
,
Mr
Dedalus
,
and
you
will
see
.
There
is
an
art
in
*NL*
lighting
a
fire
.
We
have
the
liberal
arts
and
we
have
the
useful
arts
.
*NL*
This
is
one
of
the
useful
arts
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
will
try
to
learn
it
,
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
too
much
coal
,
said
the
dean
,
working
briskly
at
his
task
,
that
*NL*
is
one
of
the
secrets
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
produced
four
candle-butts
from
the
side-pockets
of
his
soutane
and
*NL*
placed
them
deftly
among
the
coals
and
twisted
papers
.
Stephen
watched
*NL*
him
in
silence
.
Kneeling
thus
on
the
flagstone
to
kindle
the
fire
and
*NL*
busied
with
the
disposition
of
his
wisps
of
paper
and
candle-butts
he
*NL*
seemed
more
than
ever
a
humble
server
making
ready
the
place
of
*NL*
sacrifice
in
an
empty
temple
,
a
levite
of
the
Lord
.
Like
a
levite
's
*NL*
robe
of
plain
linen
the
faded
worn
soutane
draped
the
kneeling
figure
*NL*
of
one
whom
the
canonicals
or
the
bell-bordered
ephod
would
irk
and
*NL*
trouble
.
His
very
body
had
waxed
old
in
lowly
service
of
the
Lord
--
in
*NL*
tending
the
fire
upon
the
altar
,
in
bearing
tidings
secretly
,
in
*NL*
waiting
upon
worldlings
,
in
striking
swiftly
when
bidden
--
and
yet
had
*NL*
remained
ungraced
by
aught
of
saintly
or
of
prelatic
beauty
.
Nay
,
his
*NL*
very
soul
had
waxed
old
in
that
service
without
growing
towards
light
*NL*
and
beauty
or
spreading
abroad
a
sweet
odour
of
her
sanctity
--
a
*NL*
mortified
will
no
more
responsive
to
the
thrill
of
its
obedience
than
*NL*
was
to
the
thrill
of
love
or
combat
his
ageing
body
,
spare
and
sinewy
,
*NL*
greyed
with
a
silver-pointed
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dean
rested
back
on
his
hunkers
and
watched
the
sticks
catch
.
*NL*
Stephen
,
to
fill
the
silence
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
sure
I
could
not
light
a
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
are
an
artist
,
are
you
not
,
Mr
Dedalus
?
said
the
dean
,
glancing
*NL*
up
and
blinking
his
pale
eyes
.
The
object
of
the
artist
is
the
creation
*NL*
of
the
beautiful
.
What
the
beautiful
is
is
another
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rubbed
his
hands
slowly
and
drily
over
the
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Can
you
solve
that
question
now
?
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Aquinas
,
answered
Stephen
,
says
PULCRA
SUNT
QUAE
VISA
PLACENT
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
fire
before
us
,
said
the
dean
,
will
be
pleasing
to
the
eye
.
*NL*
Will
it
therefore
be
beautiful
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
so
far
as
it
is
apprehended
by
the
sight
,
which
I
suppose
means
*NL*
here
esthetic
intellection
,
it
will
be
beautiful
.
But
Aquinas
also
says
*NL*
BONUM
EST
IN
QUOD
TENDIT
APPETITUS
.
In
so
far
as
it
satisfies
the
*NL*
animal
craving
for
warmth
fire
is
a
good
.
In
hell
,
however
,
it
is
an
*NL*
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Quite
so
,
said
the
dean
,
you
have
certainly
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
nimbly
and
went
towards
the
door
,
set
it
ajar
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
draught
is
said
to
be
a
help
in
these
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
came
back
to
the
hearth
,
limping
slightly
but
with
a
brisk
step
,
*NL*
Stephen
saw
the
silent
soul
of
a
jesuit
look
out
at
him
from
the
pale
*NL*
loveless
eyes
.
Like
Ignatius
he
was
lame
but
in
his
eyes
burned
no
*NL*
spark
of
Ignatius
's
enthusiasm
.
Even
the
legendary
craft
of
the
*NL*
company
,
a
craft
subtler
and
more
secret
than
its
fabled
books
of
*NL*
secret
subtle
wisdom
,
had
not
fired
his
soul
with
the
energy
of
*NL*
apostleship
.
It
seemed
as
if
he
used
the
shifts
and
lore
and
cunning
of
*NL*
the
world
,
as
bidden
to
do
,
for
the
greater
glory
of
God
,
without
joy
*NL*
in
their
handling
or
hatred
of
that
in
them
which
was
evil
but
turning
*NL*
them
,
with
a
firm
gesture
of
obedience
back
upon
themselves
and
for
all
*NL*
this
silent
service
it
seemed
as
if
he
loved
not
at
all
the
master
and
*NL*
little
,
if
at
all
,
the
ends
he
served
.
SIMILITER
ATQUE
SENIS
BACULUS
,
*NL*
he
was
,
as
the
founder
would
have
had
him
,
like
a
staff
in
an
old
man
's
*NL*
hand
,
to
be
leaned
on
in
the
road
at
nightfall
or
in
stress
of
weather
,
*NL*
to
lie
with
a
lady
's
nosegay
on
a
garden
seat
,
to
be
raised
in
menace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dean
returned
to
the
hearth
and
began
to
stroke
his
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
When
may
we
expect
to
have
something
from
you
on
the
esthetic
*NL*
question
?
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
From
me
!
said
Stephen
in
astonishment
.
I
stumble
on
an
idea
once
a
*NL*
fortnight
if
I
am
lucky
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
These
questions
are
very
profound
,
Mr
Dedalus
,
said
the
dean
.
It
is
*NL*
like
looking
down
from
the
cliffs
of
Moher
into
the
depths
.
Many
go
*NL*
down
into
the
depths
and
never
come
up
.
Only
the
trained
diver
can
go
*NL*
down
into
those
depths
and
explore
them
and
come
to
the
surface
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
you
mean
speculation
,
sir
,
said
Stephen
,
I
also
am
sure
that
*NL*
there
is
no
such
thing
as
free
thinking
inasmuch
as
all
thinking
must
*NL*
be
bound
by
its
own
laws
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ha
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
For
my
purpose
I
can
work
on
at
present
by
the
light
of
one
or
two
*NL*
ideas
of
Aristotle
and
Aquinas
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
see
.
I
quite
see
your
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
need
them
only
for
my
own
use
and
guidance
until
I
have
done
*NL*
something
for
myself
by
their
light
.
If
the
lamp
smokes
or
smells
I
*NL*
shall
try
to
trim
it
.
If
it
does
not
give
light
enough
I
shall
sell
it
*NL*
and
buy
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Epictetus
also
had
a
lamp
,
said
the
dean
,
which
was
sold
for
a
fancy
*NL*
price
after
his
death
.
It
was
the
lamp
he
wrote
his
philosophical
*NL*
dissertations
by
.
You
know
Epictetus
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
An
old
gentleman
,
said
Stephen
coarsely
,
who
said
that
the
soul
is
*NL*
very
like
a
bucketful
of
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
tells
us
in
his
homely
way
,
the
dean
went
on
,
that
he
put
an
iron
*NL*
lamp
before
a
statue
of
one
of
the
gods
and
that
a
thief
stole
the
*NL*
lamp
.
What
did
the
philosopher
do
?
He
reflected
that
it
was
in
the
*NL*
character
of
a
thief
to
steal
and
determined
to
buy
an
earthen
lamp
*NL*
next
day
instead
of
the
iron
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
smell
of
molten
tallow
came
up
from
the
dean
's
candle
butts
and
fused
*NL*
itself
in
Stephen
's
consciousness
with
the
jingle
of
the
words
,
bucket
*NL*
and
lamp
and
lamp
and
bucket
.
The
priest
's
voice
,
too
,
had
a
hard
*NL*
jingling
tone
.
Stephen
's
mind
halted
by
instinct
,
checked
by
the
*NL*
strange
tone
and
the
imagery
and
by
the
priest
's
face
which
seemed
like
*NL*
an
unlit
lamp
or
a
reflector
hung
in
a
false
focus
.
What
lay
behind
it
*NL*
or
within
it
?
A
dull
torpor
of
the
soul
or
the
dullness
of
the
*NL*
thundercloud
,
charged
with
intellection
and
capable
of
the
gloom
of
*NL*
God
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
meant
a
different
kind
of
lamp
,
sir
,
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Undoubtedly
,
said
the
dean
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
One
difficulty
,
said
Stephen
,
in
esthetic
discussion
is
to
know
*NL*
whether
words
are
being
used
according
to
the
literary
tradition
or
*NL*
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
marketplace
.
I
remember
a
sentence
of
*NL*
Newman
's
in
which
he
says
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
that
she
was
detained
*NL*
in
the
full
company
of
the
saints
.
The
use
of
the
word
in
the
*NL*
marketplace
is
quite
different
.
I
HOPE
I
AM
NOT
DETAINING
YOU
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
in
the
least
,
said
the
dean
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
no
,
said
Stephen
,
smiling
,
I
mean
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
yes
;
I
see
,
said
the
dean
quickly
,
I
quite
catch
the
point
:
*NL*
DETAIN
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thrust
forward
his
under
jaw
and
uttered
a
dry
short
cough
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
return
to
the
lamp
,
he
said
,
the
feeding
of
it
is
also
a
nice
*NL*
problem
.
You
must
choose
the
pure
oil
and
you
must
be
careful
when
you
*NL*
pour
it
in
not
to
overflow
it
,
not
to
pour
in
more
than
the
funnel
can
*NL*
hold
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
funnel
?
asked
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
funnel
through
which
you
pour
the
oil
into
your
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
?
said
Stephen
.
Is
that
called
a
funnel
?
Is
it
not
a
tundish
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
a
tundish
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
.
The
...
funnel
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
that
called
a
tundish
in
Ireland
?
asked
the
dean
.
I
never
heard
*NL*
the
word
in
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
called
a
tundish
in
Lower
Drumcondra
,
said
Stephen
,
laughing
,
*NL*
where
they
speak
the
best
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
tundish
,
said
the
dean
reflectively
.
That
is
a
most
interesting
*NL*
word
.
I
must
look
that
word
up
.
Upon
my
word
I
must
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
courtesy
of
manner
rang
a
little
false
and
Stephen
looked
at
the
*NL*
English
convert
with
the
same
eyes
as
the
elder
brother
in
the
parable
*NL*
may
have
turned
on
the
prodigal
.
A
humble
follower
in
the
wake
of
*NL*
clamorous
conversions
,
a
poor
Englishman
in
Ireland
,
he
seemed
to
have
*NL*
entered
on
the
stage
of
jesuit
history
when
that
strange
play
of
*NL*
intrigue
and
suffering
and
envy
and
struggle
and
indignity
had
been
all
*NL*
but
given
through
--
a
late-comer
,
a
tardy
spirit
.
From
what
had
he
set
*NL*
out
?
Perhaps
he
had
been
born
and
bred
among
serious
dissenters
,
seeing
*NL*
salvation
in
Jesus
only
and
abhorring
the
vain
pomps
of
the
*NL*
establishment
.
Had
he
felt
the
need
of
an
implicit
faith
amid
the
*NL*
welter
of
sectarianism
and
the
jargon
of
its
turbulent
schisms
,
six
*NL*
principle
men
,
peculiar
people
,
seed
and
snake
baptists
,
supralapsarian
*NL*
dogmatists
?
Had
he
found
the
true
church
all
of
a
sudden
in
winding
up
*NL*
to
the
end
like
a
reel
of
cotton
some
fine-spun
line
of
reasoning
upon
*NL*
insufflation
on
the
imposition
of
hands
or
the
procession
of
the
Holy
*NL*
Ghost
?
Or
had
Lord
Christ
touched
him
and
bidden
him
follow
,
like
that
*NL*
disciple
who
had
sat
at
the
receipt
of
custom
,
as
he
sat
by
the
door
of
*NL*
some
zinc-roofed
chapel
,
yawning
and
telling
over
his
church
pence
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
dean
repeated
the
word
yet
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tundish
!
Well
now
,
that
is
interesting
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
question
you
asked
me
a
moment
ago
seems
to
me
more
interesting
.
*NL*
What
is
that
beauty
which
the
artist
struggles
to
express
from
lumps
of
*NL*
earth
,
said
Stephen
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
word
seemed
to
have
turned
a
rapier
point
of
his
*NL*
sensitiveness
against
this
courteous
and
vigilant
foe
.
He
felt
with
a
*NL*
smart
of
dejection
that
the
man
to
whom
he
was
speaking
was
a
*NL*
countryman
of
Ben
Jonson
.
He
thought
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
language
in
which
we
are
speaking
is
his
before
it
is
mine
.
How
*NL*
different
are
the
words
HOME
,
CHRIST
,
ALE
,
MASTER
,
on
his
lips
and
on
*NL*
mine
!
I
can
not
speak
or
write
these
words
without
unrest
of
spirit
.
His
*NL*
language
,
so
familiar
and
so
foreign
,
will
always
be
for
me
an
acquired
*NL*
speech
.
I
have
not
made
or
accepted
its
words
.
My
voice
holds
them
at
*NL*
bay
.
My
soul
frets
in
the
shadow
of
his
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
to
distinguish
between
the
beautiful
and
the
sublime
,
the
dean
*NL*
added
,
to
distinguish
between
moral
beauty
and
material
beauty
.
And
to
*NL*
inquire
what
kind
of
beauty
is
proper
to
each
of
the
various
arts
.
*NL*
These
are
some
interesting
points
we
might
take
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
disheartened
suddenly
by
the
dean
's
firm
,
dry
tone
,
was
*NL*
silent
;
and
through
the
silence
a
distant
noise
of
many
boots
and
*NL*
confused
voices
came
up
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
pursuing
these
speculations
,
said
the
dean
conclusively
,
there
*NL*
is
,
however
,
the
danger
of
perishing
of
inanition
.
First
you
must
take
*NL*
your
degree
.
Set
that
before
you
as
your
first
aim
.
Then
,
little
by
*NL*
little
,
you
will
see
your
way
.
I
mean
in
every
sense
,
your
way
in
life
*NL*
and
in
thinking
.
It
may
be
uphill
pedalling
at
first
.
Take
Mr
Moonan
.
*NL*
He
was
a
long
time
before
he
got
to
the
top
.
But
he
got
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
may
not
have
his
talent
,
said
Stephen
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
never
know
,
said
the
dean
brightly
.
We
never
can
say
what
is
in
*NL*
us
.
I
most
certainly
should
not
be
despondent
.
PER
ASPERA
AD
ASTRA
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
hearth
quickly
and
went
towards
the
landing
to
oversee
the
*NL*
arrival
of
the
first
arts
'
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaning
against
the
fireplace
Stephen
heard
him
greet
briskly
and
*NL*
impartially
every
student
of
the
class
and
could
almost
see
the
frank
*NL*
smiles
of
the
coarser
students
.
A
desolating
pity
began
to
fall
like
*NL*
dew
upon
his
easily
embittered
heart
for
this
faithful
serving-man
of
*NL*
the
knightly
Loyola
,
for
this
half-brother
of
the
clergy
,
more
venal
*NL*
than
they
in
speech
,
more
steadfast
of
soul
than
they
,
one
whom
he
*NL*
would
never
call
his
ghostly
father
;
and
he
thought
how
this
man
and
*NL*
his
companions
had
earned
the
name
of
worldlings
at
the
hands
not
of
*NL*
the
unworldly
only
but
of
the
worldly
also
for
having
pleaded
,
during
*NL*
all
their
history
,
at
the
bar
of
God
's
justice
for
the
souls
of
the
lax
*NL*
and
the
lukewarm
and
the
prudent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entry
of
the
professor
was
signalled
by
a
few
rounds
of
Kentish
*NL*
fire
from
the
heavy
boots
of
those
students
who
sat
on
the
highest
tier
*NL*
of
the
gloomy
theatre
under
the
grey
cobwebbed
windows
.
The
calling
of
*NL*
the
roll
began
and
the
responses
to
the
names
were
given
out
in
all
*NL*
tones
until
the
name
of
Peter
Byrne
was
reached
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
deep
bass
note
in
response
came
from
the
upper
tier
,
followed
by
*NL*
coughs
of
protest
along
the
other
benches
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
professor
paused
in
his
reading
and
called
the
next
name
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Cranly
!
*NL*
*NL*
No
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mr
Cranly
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
smile
flew
across
Stephen
's
face
as
he
thought
of
his
friend
's
*NL*
studies
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Try
Leopardstown
!
said
a
voice
from
the
bench
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
glanced
up
quickly
but
Moynihan
's
snoutish
face
,
outlined
on
the
*NL*
grey
light
,
was
impassive
.
A
formula
was
given
out
.
Amid
the
rustling
of
*NL*
the
notebooks
Stephen
turned
back
again
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Give
me
some
paper
for
God
's
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
as
bad
as
that
?
asked
Moynihan
with
a
broad
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tore
a
sheet
from
his
scribbler
and
passed
it
down
,
whispering
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
case
of
necessity
any
layman
or
woman
can
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
formula
which
he
wrote
obediently
on
the
sheet
of
paper
,
the
*NL*
coiling
and
uncoiling
calculations
of
the
professor
,
the
spectre-like
*NL*
symbols
of
force
and
velocity
fascinated
and
jaded
Stephen
's
mind
.
He
*NL*
had
heard
some
say
that
the
old
professor
was
an
atheist
freemason
.
O
*NL*
the
grey
dull
day
!
It
seemed
a
limbo
of
painless
patient
consciousness
*NL*
through
which
souls
of
mathematicians
might
wander
,
projecting
long
*NL*
slender
fabrics
from
plane
to
plane
of
ever
rarer
and
paler
twilight
,
*NL*
radiating
swift
eddies
to
the
last
verges
of
a
universe
ever
vaster
,
*NL*
farther
and
more
impalpable
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
So
we
must
distinguish
between
elliptical
and
ellipsoidal
.
Perhaps
some
*NL*
of
you
gentlemen
may
be
familiar
with
the
works
of
Mr
W.
S.
Gilbert
.
In
*NL*
one
of
his
songs
he
speaks
of
the
billiard
sharp
who
is
condemned
to
*NL*
play
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
cloth
untrue
*NL*
With
a
twisted
cue
*NL*
And
elliptical
billiard
balls
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
means
a
ball
having
the
form
of
the
ellipsoid
of
the
principal
*NL*
axes
of
which
I
spoke
a
moment
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moynihan
leaned
down
towards
Stephen
's
ear
and
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
price
ellipsoidal
balls
!
chase
me
,
ladies
,
I
'm
in
the
cavalry
!
*NL*
*NL*
His
fellow
student
's
rude
humour
ran
like
a
gust
through
the
cloister
*NL*
of
Stephen
's
mind
,
shaking
into
gay
life
limp
priestly
vestments
that
*NL*
hung
upon
the
walls
,
setting
them
to
sway
and
caper
in
a
sabbath
of
*NL*
misrule
.
The
forms
of
the
community
emerged
from
the
gust-blown
*NL*
vestments
,
the
dean
of
studies
,
the
portly
florid
bursar
with
his
cap
*NL*
of
grey
hair
,
the
president
,
the
little
priest
with
feathery
hair
who
*NL*
wrote
devout
verses
,
the
squat
peasant
form
of
the
professor
of
*NL*
economics
,
the
tall
form
of
the
young
professor
of
mental
science
*NL*
discussing
on
the
landing
a
case
of
conscience
with
his
class
like
a
*NL*
giraffe
cropping
high
leafage
among
a
herd
of
antelopes
,
the
grave
*NL*
troubled
prefect
of
the
sodality
,
the
plump
round-headed
professor
of
*NL*
Italian
with
his
rogue
's
eyes
.
They
came
ambling
and
stumbling
,
*NL*
tumbling
and
capering
,
kilting
their
gowns
for
leap
frog
,
holding
one
*NL*
another
back
,
shaken
with
deep
false
laughter
,
smacking
one
another
*NL*
behind
and
laughing
at
their
rude
malice
,
calling
to
one
another
by
*NL*
familiar
nicknames
,
protesting
with
sudden
dignity
at
some
rough
usage
,
*NL*
whispering
two
and
two
behind
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
professor
had
gone
to
the
glass
cases
on
the
side
wall
,
from
a
*NL*
shelf
of
which
he
took
down
a
set
of
coils
,
blew
away
the
dust
from
*NL*
many
points
and
,
bearing
it
carefully
to
the
table
,
held
a
finger
on
it
*NL*
while
he
proceeded
with
his
lecture
.
He
explained
that
the
wires
in
*NL*
modern
coils
were
of
a
compound
called
platinoid
lately
discovered
by
*NL*
F.
W.
Martino
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
clearly
the
initials
and
surname
of
the
discoverer
.
Moynihan
*NL*
whispered
from
behind
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
old
Fresh
Water
Martin
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ask
him
,
Stephen
whispered
back
with
weary
humour
,
if
he
wants
a
*NL*
subject
for
electrocution
.
He
can
have
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moynihan
,
seeing
the
professor
bend
over
the
coils
,
rose
in
his
bench
*NL*
and
,
clacking
noiselessly
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
,
began
to
call
*NL*
with
the
voice
of
a
slobbering
urchin
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Please
teacher
!
This
boy
is
after
saying
a
bad
word
,
teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Platinoid
,
the
professor
said
solemnly
,
is
preferred
to
German
*NL*
silver
because
it
has
a
lower
coefficient
of
resistance
by
changes
of
*NL*
temperature
.
The
platinoid
wire
is
insulated
and
the
covering
of
silk
*NL*
that
insulates
it
is
wound
on
the
ebonite
bobbins
just
where
my
finger
*NL*
is
.
If
it
were
wound
single
an
extra
current
would
be
induced
in
the
*NL*
coils
.
The
bobbins
are
saturated
in
hot
paraffin
wax
...
*NL*
*NL*
A
sharp
Ulster
voice
said
from
the
bench
below
Stephen
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
we
likely
to
be
asked
questions
on
applied
science
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
professor
began
to
juggle
gravely
with
the
terms
pure
science
and
*NL*
applied
science
.
A
heavy-built
student
,
wearing
gold
spectacles
,
stared
*NL*
with
some
wonder
at
the
questioner
.
Moynihan
murmured
from
behind
in
*NL*
his
natural
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
n't
MacAlister
a
devil
for
his
pound
of
flesh
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
looked
coldly
on
the
oblong
skull
beneath
him
overgrown
with
*NL*
tangled
twine-coloured
hair
.
The
voice
,
the
accent
,
the
mind
of
the
*NL*
questioner
offended
him
and
he
allowed
the
offence
to
carry
him
towards
*NL*
wilful
unkindness
,
bidding
his
mind
think
that
the
student
's
father
*NL*
would
have
done
better
had
he
sent
his
son
to
Belfast
to
study
and
have
*NL*
saved
something
on
the
train
fare
by
so
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
oblong
skull
beneath
did
not
turn
to
meet
this
shaft
of
thought
and
*NL*
yet
the
shaft
came
back
to
its
bowstring
;
for
he
saw
in
a
moment
the
*NL*
student
's
whey-pale
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
thought
is
not
mine
,
he
said
to
himself
quickly
.
It
came
from
*NL*
the
comic
Irishman
in
the
bench
behind
.
Patience
.
Can
you
say
with
*NL*
certitude
by
whom
the
soul
of
your
race
was
bartered
and
its
elect
*NL*
betrayed
--
by
the
questioner
or
by
the
mocker
?
Patience
.
Remember
*NL*
Epictetus
.
It
is
probably
in
his
character
to
ask
such
a
question
at
*NL*
such
a
moment
in
such
a
tone
and
to
pronounce
the
word
SCIENCE
as
a
*NL*
monosyllable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
droning
voice
of
the
professor
continued
to
wind
itself
slowly
*NL*
round
and
round
the
coils
it
spoke
of
,
doubling
,
trebling
,
quadrupling
*NL*
its
somnolent
energy
as
the
coil
multiplied
its
ohms
of
resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moynihan
's
voice
called
from
behind
in
echo
to
a
distant
bell
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Closing
time
,
gents
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance
hall
was
crowded
and
loud
with
talk
.
On
a
table
near
the
*NL*
door
were
two
photographs
in
frames
and
between
them
a
long
roll
of
*NL*
paper
bearing
an
irregular
tail
of
signatures
.
MacCann
went
briskly
to
*NL*
and
fro
among
the
students
,
talking
rapidly
,
answering
rebuffs
and
*NL*
leading
one
after
another
to
the
table
.
In
the
inner
hall
the
dean
of
*NL*
studies
stood
talking
to
a
young
professor
,
stroking
his
chin
gravely
*NL*
and
nodding
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
checked
by
the
crowd
at
the
door
,
halted
irresolutely
.
From
*NL*
under
the
wide
falling
leaf
of
a
soft
hat
Cranly
's
dark
eyes
were
*NL*
watching
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Have
you
signed
?
Stephen
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
closed
his
long
thin-lipped
mouth
,
communed
with
himself
an
*NL*
instant
and
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
EGO
HABEO
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
it
for
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
QUOD
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
it
for
?
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
turned
his
pale
face
to
Stephen
and
said
blandly
and
bitterly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
PER
PAX
UNIVERSALIS
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
pointed
to
the
Tsar
's
photograph
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
has
the
face
of
a
besotted
Christ
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scorn
and
anger
in
his
voice
brought
Cranly
's
eyes
back
from
a
calm
*NL*
survey
of
the
walls
of
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
annoyed
?
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
answered
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
in
bad
humour
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
CREDO
UT
VOS
SANGUINARIUS
MENDAX
ESTIS
,
said
Cranly
,
QUIA
FACIES
*NL*
VOSTRA
MONSTRAT
UT
VOS
IN
DAMNO
MALO
HUMORE
ESTIS
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moynihan
,
on
his
way
to
the
table
,
said
in
Stephen
's
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
MacCann
is
in
tiptop
form
.
Ready
to
shed
the
last
drop
.
Brand
new
*NL*
world
.
No
stimulants
and
votes
for
the
bitches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
smiled
at
the
manner
of
this
confidence
and
,
when
Moynihan
had
*NL*
passed
,
turned
again
to
meet
Cranly
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Perhaps
you
can
tell
me
,
he
said
,
why
he
pours
his
soul
so
freely
*NL*
into
my
ear
.
Can
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
dull
scowl
appeared
on
Cranly
's
forehead
.
He
stared
at
the
table
*NL*
where
Moynihan
had
bent
to
write
his
name
on
the
roll
,
and
then
said
*NL*
flatly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
sugar
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
QUIS
EST
IN
MALO
HUMORE
,
said
Stephen
,
EGO
AUT
VOS
?
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
did
not
take
up
the
taunt
.
He
brooded
sourly
on
his
judgement
*NL*
and
repeated
with
the
same
flat
force
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
flaming
bloody
sugar
,
that
's
what
he
is
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
his
epitaph
for
all
dead
friendships
and
Stephen
wondered
*NL*
whether
it
would
ever
be
spoken
in
the
same
tone
over
his
memory
.
The
*NL*
heavy
lumpish
phrase
sank
slowly
out
of
hearing
like
a
stone
through
a
*NL*
quagmire
.
Stephen
saw
it
sink
as
he
had
seen
many
another
,
feeling
its
*NL*
heaviness
depress
his
heart
.
Cranly
's
speech
,
unlike
that
of
Davin
,
had
*NL*
neither
rare
phrases
of
Elizabethan
English
nor
quaintly
turned
*NL*
versions
of
Irish
idioms
.
Its
drawl
was
an
echo
of
the
quays
of
Dublin
*NL*
given
back
by
a
bleak
decaying
seaport
,
its
energy
an
echo
of
the
*NL*
sacred
eloquence
of
Dublin
given
back
flatly
by
a
Wicklow
pulpit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heavy
scowl
faded
from
Cranly
's
face
as
MacCann
marched
briskly
*NL*
towards
them
from
the
other
side
of
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
you
are
!
said
MacCann
cheerily
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
I
am
!
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Late
as
usual
.
Can
you
not
combine
the
progressive
tendency
with
a
*NL*
respect
for
punctuality
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
question
is
out
of
order
,
said
Stephen
.
Next
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
smiling
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
silver-wrapped
tablet
of
milk
chocolate
*NL*
which
peeped
out
of
the
propagandist
's
breast-pocket
.
A
little
ring
of
*NL*
listeners
closed
round
to
hear
the
war
of
wits
.
A
lean
student
with
*NL*
olive
skin
and
lank
black
hair
thrust
his
face
between
the
two
,
glancing
*NL*
from
one
to
the
other
at
each
phrase
and
seeming
to
try
to
catch
each
*NL*
flying
phrase
in
his
open
moist
mouth
.
Cranly
took
a
small
grey
handball
*NL*
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
examine
it
closely
,
turning
it
over
and
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Next
business
?
said
MacCann
.
Hom
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
a
loud
cough
of
laughter
,
smiled
broadly
and
tugged
twice
at
*NL*
the
straw-coloured
goatee
which
hung
from
his
blunt
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
next
business
is
to
sign
the
testimonial
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Will
you
pay
me
anything
if
I
sign
?
asked
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
thought
you
were
an
idealist
,
said
MacCann
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gipsy-like
student
looked
about
him
and
addressed
the
onlookers
in
*NL*
an
indistinct
bleating
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
By
hell
,
that
's
a
queer
notion
.
I
consider
that
notion
to
be
a
*NL*
mercenary
notion
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
faded
into
silence
.
No
heed
was
paid
to
his
words
.
He
turned
*NL*
his
olive
face
,
equine
in
expression
,
towards
Stephen
,
inviting
him
to
*NL*
speak
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
MacCann
began
to
speak
with
fluent
energy
of
the
Tsar
's
rescript
,
of
*NL*
Stead
,
of
general
disarmament
arbitration
in
cases
of
international
*NL*
disputes
,
of
the
signs
of
the
times
,
of
the
new
humanity
and
the
new
*NL*
gospel
of
life
which
would
make
it
the
business
of
the
community
to
*NL*
secure
as
cheaply
as
possible
the
greatest
possible
happiness
of
the
*NL*
greatest
possible
number
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gipsy
student
responded
to
the
close
of
the
period
by
crying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Three
cheers
for
universal
brotherhood
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Go
on
,
Temple
,
said
a
stout
ruddy
student
near
him
.
I
'll
stand
you
a
*NL*
pint
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
a
believer
in
universal
brotherhood
,
said
Temple
,
glancing
about
*NL*
him
out
of
his
dark
oval
eyes
.
Marx
is
only
a
bloody
cod
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
gripped
his
arm
tightly
to
check
his
tongue
,
smiling
uneasily
,
*NL*
and
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Easy
,
easy
,
easy
!
*NL*
*NL*
Temple
struggled
to
free
his
arm
but
continued
,
his
mouth
flecked
by
a
*NL*
thin
foam
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Socialism
was
founded
by
an
Irishman
and
the
first
man
in
Europe
who
*NL*
preached
the
freedom
of
thought
was
Collins
.
Two
hundred
years
ago
.
He
*NL*
denounced
priestcraft
,
the
philosopher
of
Middlesex
.
Three
cheers
for
*NL*
John
Anthony
Collins
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
thin
voice
from
the
verge
of
the
ring
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pip
!
pip
!
*NL*
*NL*
Moynihan
murmured
beside
Stephen
's
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
what
about
John
Anthony
's
poor
little
sister
:
*NL*
*NL*
Lottie
Collins
lost
her
drawers
;
*NL*
Wo
n't
you
kindly
lend
her
yours
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
laughed
and
Moynihan
,
pleased
with
the
result
,
murmured
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
'll
have
five
bob
each
way
on
John
Anthony
Collins
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
waiting
for
your
answer
,
said
MacCann
briefly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
affair
does
n't
interest
me
in
the
least
,
said
Stephen
wearily
.
*NL*
You
know
that
well
.
Why
do
you
make
a
scene
about
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
!
said
MacCann
,
smacking
his
lips
.
You
are
a
reactionary
,
then
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
think
you
impress
me
,
Stephen
asked
,
when
you
flourish
your
*NL*
wooden
sword
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Metaphors
!
said
MacCann
bluntly
.
Come
to
facts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
blushed
and
turned
aside
.
MacCann
stood
his
ground
and
said
with
*NL*
hostile
humour
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Minor
poets
,
I
suppose
,
are
above
such
trivial
questions
as
the
*NL*
question
of
universal
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
raised
his
head
and
held
the
handball
between
the
two
students
*NL*
by
way
of
a
peace-offering
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
PAX
SUPER
TOTUM
SANGUINARIUM
GLOBUM
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
moving
away
the
bystanders
,
jerked
his
shoulder
angrily
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
Tsar
's
image
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Keep
your

If
we
must
have
a
Jesus
let
us
have
a
legitimate
*NL*
Jesus
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
By
hell
,
that
's
a
good
one
!
said
the
gipsy
student
to
those
about
*NL*
him
,
that
's
a
fine
expression
.
I
like
that
expression
immensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gulped
down
the
spittle
in
his
throat
as
if
he
were
gulping
down
the
*NL*
phrase
and
,
fumbling
at
the
peak
of
his
tweed
cap
,
turned
to
Stephen
,
*NL*
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
what
do
you
mean
by
that
expression
you
uttered
just
*NL*
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
himself
jostled
by
the
students
near
him
,
he
said
to
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
curious
to
know
now
what
he
meant
by
that
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
again
to
Stephen
and
said
in
a
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
believe
in
Jesus
?
I
believe
in
man
.
Of
course
,
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
if
you
believe
in
man
.
I
admire
you
,
sir
.
I
admire
the
mind
of
man
*NL*
independent
of
all
religions
.
Is
that
your
opinion
about
the
mind
of
*NL*
Jesus
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Go
on
,
Temple
,
said
the
stout
ruddy
student
,
returning
,
as
was
his
*NL*
wont
,
to
his
first
idea
,
that
pint
is
waiting
for
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
thinks
I
'm
an
imbecile
,
Temple
explained
to
Stephen
,
because
I
'm
a
*NL*
believer
in
the
power
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
linked
his
arms
into
those
of
Stephen
and
his
admirer
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
NOS
AD
MANUM
BALLUM
JOCABIMUS
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
in
the
act
of
being
led
away
,
caught
sight
of
MacCann
's
*NL*
flushed
blunt-featured
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
signature
is
of
no
account
,
he
said
politely
.
You
are
right
to
go
*NL*
your
way
.
Leave
me
to
go
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dedalus
,
said
MacCann
crisply
,
I
believe
you
're
a
good
fellow
but
*NL*
you
have
yet
to
learn
the
dignity
of
altruism
and
the
responsibility
of
*NL*
the
human
individual
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Intellectual
crankery
is
better
out
of
this
movement
than
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
recognizing
the
harsh
tone
of
MacAlister
's
voice
did
not
turn
*NL*
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
.
Cranly
pushed
solemnly
through
the
*NL*
throng
of
students
,
linking
Stephen
and
Temple
like
a
celebrant
*NL*
attended
by
his
ministers
on
his
way
to
the
altar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Temple
bent
eagerly
across
Cranly
's
breast
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
you
hear
MacAlister
what
he
said
?
That
youth
is
jealous
of
you
.
*NL*
Did
you
see
that
?
I
bet
Cranly
did
n't
see
that
.
By
hell
,
I
saw
that
at
*NL*
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
crossed
the
inner
hall
,
the
dean
of
studies
was
in
the
act
of
*NL*
escaping
from
the
student
with
whom
he
had
been
conversing
.
He
stood
at
*NL*
the
foot
of
the
staircase
,
a
foot
on
the
lowest
step
,
his
threadbare
*NL*
soutane
gathered
about
him
for
the
ascent
with
womanish
care
,
nodding
*NL*
his
head
often
and
repeating
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
a
doubt
of
it
,
Mr
Hackett
!
Very
fine
!
Not
a
doubt
of
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
hall
the
prefect
of
the
college
sodality
was
*NL*
speaking
earnestly
,
in
a
soft
querulous
voice
,
with
a
boarder
.
As
he
*NL*
spoke
he
wrinkled
a
little
his
freckled
brow
and
bit
,
between
his
*NL*
phrases
,
at
a
tiny
bone
pencil
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
hope
the
matric
men
will
all
come
.
The
first
arts
'
men
are
pretty
*NL*
sure
.
Second
arts
,
too
.
We
must
make
sure
of
the
newcomers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Temple
bent
again
across
Cranly
,
as
they
were
passing
through
the
*NL*
doorway
,
and
said
in
a
swift
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
know
that
he
is
a
married
man
?
he
was
a
married
man
before
*NL*
they
converted
him
.
He
has
a
wife
and
children
somewhere
.
By
hell
,
I
*NL*
think
that
's
the
queerest
notion
I
ever
heard
!
Eh
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
whisper
trailed
off
into
sly
cackling
laughter
.
The
moment
they
*NL*
were
through
the
doorway
Cranly
seized
him
rudely
by
the
neck
and
shook
*NL*
him
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
flaming
floundering
fool
!
I
'll
take
my
dying
bible
there
is
n't
a
*NL*
bigger
bloody
ape
,
do
you
know
,
than
you
in
the
whole
flaming
bloody
*NL*
world
!
*NL*
*NL*
Temple
wriggled
in
his
grip
,
laughing
still
with
sly
content
,
while
*NL*
Cranly
repeated
flatly
at
every
rude
shake
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
flaming
flaring
bloody
idiot
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
crossed
the
weedy
garden
together
.
The
president
,
wrapped
in
a
*NL*
heavy
loose
cloak
,
was
coming
towards
them
along
one
of
the
walks
,
*NL*
reading
his
office
.
At
the
end
of
the
walk
he
halted
before
turning
and
*NL*
raised
his
eyes
.
The
students
saluted
,
Temple
fumbling
as
before
at
the
*NL*
peak
of
his
cap
.
They
walked
forward
in
silence
.
As
they
neared
the
*NL*
alley
Stephen
could
hear
the
thuds
of
the
players
'
hands
and
the
wet
*NL*
smacks
of
the
ball
and
Davin
's
voice
crying
out
excitedly
at
each
*NL*
stroke
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
students
halted
round
the
box
on
which
Davin
sat
to
follow
*NL*
the
game
.
Temple
,
after
a
few
moments
,
sidled
across
to
Stephen
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Excuse
me
,
I
wanted
to
ask
you
,
do
you
believe
that
Jean-Jacques
*NL*
Rousseau
was
a
sincere
man
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
laughed
outright
.
Cranly
,
picking
up
the
broken
stave
of
a
cask
*NL*
from
the
grass
at
his
feet
,
turned
swiftly
and
said
sternly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Temple
,
I
declare
to
the
living
God
if
you
say
another
word
,
do
you
*NL*
know
,
to
anybody
on
any
subject
,
I
'll
kill
you
SUPER
SPOTTUM
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
was
like
you
,
I
fancy
,
said
Stephen
,
an
emotional
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Blast
him
,
curse
him
!
said
Cranly
broadly
.
Do
n't
talk
to
him
at
all
.
*NL*
Sure
,
you
might
as
well
be
talking
,
do
you
know
,
to
a
flaming
*NL*
chamber-pot
as
talking
to
Temple
.
Go
home
,
Temple
.
For
God
's
sake
,
go
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
n't
care
a
damn
about
you
,
Cranly
,
answered
Temple
,
moving
out
of
*NL*
reach
of
the
uplifted
stave
and
pointing
at
Stephen
.
He
's
the
only
man
*NL*
I
see
in
this
institution
that
has
an
individual
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Institution
!
Individual
!
cried
Cranly
.
Go
home
,
blast
you
,
for
*NL*
you
're
a
hopeless
bloody
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
an
emotional
man
,
said
Temple
.
That
's
quite
rightly
expressed
.
*NL*
And
I
'm
proud
that
I
'm
an
emotionalist
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sidled
out
of
the
alley
,
smiling
slyly
.
Cranly
watched
him
with
a
*NL*
blank
expressionless
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Look
at
him
!
he
said
.
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
go-by-the-wall
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
phrase
was
greeted
by
a
strange
laugh
from
a
student
who
lounged
*NL*
against
the
wall
,
his
peaked
cap
down
on
his
eyes
.
The
laugh
,
pitched
*NL*
in
a
high
key
and
coming
from
a
so
muscular
frame
,
seemed
like
the
*NL*
whinny
of
an
elephant
.
The
student
's
body
shook
all
over
and
,
to
ease
*NL*
his
mirth
,
he
rubbed
both
his
hands
delightedly
over
his
groins
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Lynch
is
awake
,
said
Cranly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lynch
,
for
answer
,
straightened
himself
and
thrust
forward
his
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Lynch
puts
out
his
chest
,
said
Stephen
,
as
a
criticism
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lynch
smote
himself
sonorously
on
the
chest
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
has
anything
to
say
about
my
girth
?
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
took
him
at
the
word
and
the
two
began
to
tussle
.
When
their
*NL*
faces
had
flushed
with
the
struggle
they
drew
apart
,
panting
.
Stephen
*NL*
bent
down
towards
Davin
who
,
intent
on
the
game
,
had
paid
no
heed
to
*NL*
the
talk
of
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
how
is
my
little
tame
goose
?
he
asked
.
Did
he
sign
,
too
?
*NL*
*NL*
Davin
nodded
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
you
,
Stevie
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
're
a
terrible
man
,
Stevie
,
said
Davin
,
taking
the
short
pipe
*NL*
from
his
mouth
,
always
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
that
you
have
signed
the
petition
for
universal
peace
,
said
*NL*
Stephen
,
I
suppose
you
will
burn
that
little
copybook
I
saw
in
your
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Davin
did
not
answer
,
Stephen
began
to
quote
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Long
pace
,
fianna
!
Right
incline
,
fianna
!
Fianna
,
by
numbers
,
*NL*
salute
,
one
,
two
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
a
different
question
,
said
Davin
.
I
'm
an
Irish
nationalist
,
*NL*
first
and
foremost
.
But
that
's
you
all
out
.
You
're
a
born
sneerer
,
*NL*
Stevie
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
When
you
make
the
next
rebellion
with
hurleysticks
,
said
Stephen
,
*NL*
and
want
the
indispensable
informer
,
tell
me
.
I
can
find
you
a
few
in
*NL*
this
college
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
ca
n't
understand
you
,
said
Davin
.
One
time
I
hear
you
talk
against
*NL*
English
literature
.
Now
you
talk
against
the
Irish
informers
.
What
with
*NL*
your
name
and
your
ideas
--
Are
you
Irish
at
all
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
with
me
now
to
the
office
of
arms
and
I
will
show
you
the
tree
*NL*
of
my
family
,
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
be
one
of
us
,
said
Davin
.
Why
do
n't
you
learn
Irish
?
Why
did
you
*NL*
drop
out
of
the
league
class
after
the
first
lesson
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
know
one
reason
why
,
answered
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Davin
tossed
his
head
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Oh
,
come
now
,
he
said
.
Is
it
on
account
of
that
certain
young
lady
*NL*
and
Father
Moran
?
But
that
's
all
in
your
own
mind
,
Stevie
.
They
were
*NL*
only
talking
and
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
paused
and
laid
a
friendly
hand
upon
Davin
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
remember
,
he
said
,
when
we
knew
each
other
first
?
The
first
*NL*
morning
we
met
you
asked
me
to
show
you
the
way
to
the
matriculation
*NL*
class
,
putting
a
very
strong
stress
on
the
first
syllable
.
You
*NL*
remember
?
Then
you
used
to
address
the
jesuits
as
father
,
you
remember
?
*NL*
I
ask
myself
about
you
:
IS
HE
AS
INNOCENT
AS
HIS
SPEECH
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
a
simple
person
,
said
Davin
.
You
know
that
.
When
you
told
me
*NL*
that
night
in
Harcourt
Street
those
things
about
your
private
life
,
*NL*
honest
to
God
,
Stevie
,
I
was
not
able
to
eat
my
dinner
.
I
was
quite
*NL*
bad
.
I
was
awake
a
long
time
that
night
.
Why
did
you
tell
me
those
*NL*
things
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thanks
,
said
Stephen
.
You
mean
I
am
a
monster
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
said
Davin
.
But
I
wish
you
had
not
told
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tide
began
to
surge
beneath
the
calm
surface
of
Stephen
's
*NL*
friendliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
race
and
this
country
and
this
life
produced
me
,
he
said
.
I
*NL*
shall
express
myself
as
I
am
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Try
to
be
one
of
us
,
repeated
Davin
.
In
heart
you
are
an
Irish
man
*NL*
but
your
pride
is
too
powerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
ancestors
threw
off
their
language
and
took
another
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
They
allowed
a
handful
of
foreigners
to
subject
them
.
Do
you
fancy
I
am
*NL*
going
to
pay
in
my
own
life
and
person
debts
they
made
?
What
for
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
For
our
freedom
,
said
Davin
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
honourable
and
sincere
man
,
said
Stephen
,
has
given
up
to
you
his
*NL*
life
and
his
youth
and
his
affections
from
the
days
of
Tone
to
those
of
*NL*
Parnell
,
but
you
sold
him
to
the
enemy
or
failed
him
in
need
or
reviled
*NL*
him
and
left
him
for
another
.
And
you
invite
me
to
be
one
of
you
.
I
'd
*NL*
see
you
damned
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
died
for
their
ideals
,
Stevie
,
said
Davin
.
Our
day
will
come
*NL*
yet
,
believe
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
following
his
own
thought
,
was
silent
for
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
soul
is
born
,
he
said
vaguely
,
first
in
those
moments
I
told
you
*NL*
of
.
It
has
a
slow
and
dark
birth
,
more
mysterious
than
the
birth
of
the
*NL*
body
.
When
the
soul
of
a
man
is
born
in
this
country
there
are
nets
*NL*
flung
at
it
to
hold
it
back
from
flight
.
You
talk
to
me
of
nationality
,
*NL*
language
,
religion
.
I
shall
try
to
fly
by
those
nets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Davin
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Too
deep
for
me
,
Stevie
,
he
said
.
But
a
man
's
country
comes
first
.
*NL*
Ireland
first
,
Stevie
.
You
can
be
a
poet
or
a
mystic
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
know
what
Ireland
is
?
asked
Stephen
with
cold
violence
.
*NL*
Ireland
is
the
old
sow
that
eats
her
farrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Davin
rose
from
his
box
and
went
towards
the
players
,
shaking
his
head
*NL*
sadly
.
But
in
a
moment
his
sadness
left
him
and
he
was
hotly
disputing
*NL*
with
Cranly
and
the
two
players
who
had
finished
their
game
.
A
match
of
*NL*
four
was
arranged
,
Cranly
insisting
,
however
,
that
his
ball
should
be
*NL*
used
.
He
let
it
rebound
twice
or
thrice
to
his
hand
and
struck
it
strongly
*NL*
and
swiftly
towards
the
base
of
the
alley
,
exclaiming
in
answer
to
its
*NL*
thud
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Your
soul
!
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
stood
with
Lynch
till
the
score
began
to
rise
.
Then
he
plucked
*NL*
him
by
the
sleeve
to
come
away
.
Lynch
obeyed
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
us
eke
go
,
as
Cranly
has
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
smiled
at
this
side-thrust
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
back
through
the
garden
and
out
through
the
hall
where
the
*NL*
doddering
porter
was
pinning
up
a
hall
notice
in
the
frame
.
At
the
foot
*NL*
of
the
steps
they
halted
and
Stephen
took
a
packet
of
cigarettes
from
*NL*
his
pocket
and
offered
it
to
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
you
are
poor
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Damn
your
yellow
insolence
,
answered
Lynch
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
second
proof
of
Lynch
's
culture
made
Stephen
smile
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
was
a
great
day
for
European
culture
,
he
said
,
when
you
made
up
*NL*
your
mind
to
swear
in
yellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
lit
their
cigarettes
and
turned
to
the
right
.
After
a
pause
*NL*
Stephen
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Aristotle
has
not
defined
pity
and
terror
.
I
have
.
I
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
Lynch
halted
and
said
bluntly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Stop
!
I
wo
n't
listen
!
I
am
sick
.
I
was
out
last
night
on
a
yellow
*NL*
drunk
with
Horan
and
Goggins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pity
is
the
feeling
which
arrests
the
mind
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
whatsoever
is
grave
and
constant
in
human
sufferings
and
unites
it
with
*NL*
the
human
sufferer
.
Terror
is
the
feeling
which
arrests
the
mind
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
whatsoever
is
grave
and
constant
in
human
sufferings
and
*NL*
unites
it
with
the
secret
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Repeat
,
said
Lynch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
repeated
the
definitions
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
girl
got
into
a
hansom
a
few
days
ago
,
he
went
on
,
in
London
.
She
*NL*
was
on
her
way
to
meet
her
mother
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
many
years
.
*NL*
At
the
corner
of
a
street
the
shaft
of
a
lorry
shivered
the
window
of
*NL*
the
hansom
in
the
shape
of
a
star
.
A
long
fine
needle
of
the
shivered
*NL*
glass
pierced
her
heart
.
She
died
on
the
instant
.
The
reporter
called
*NL*
it
a
tragic
death
.
It
is
not
.
It
is
remote
from
terror
and
pity
*NL*
according
to
the
terms
of
my
definitions
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
tragic
emotion
,
in
fact
,
is
a
face
looking
two
ways
,
towards
*NL*
terror
and
towards
pity
,
both
of
which
are
phases
of
it
.
You
see
I
use
*NL*
the
word
ARREST
.
I
mean
that
the
tragic
emotion
is
static
.
Or
rather
*NL*
the
dramatic
emotion
is
.
The
feelings
excited
by
improper
art
are
*NL*
kinetic
,
desire
or
loathing
.
Desire
urges
us
to
possess
,
to
go
to
*NL*
something
;
loathing
urges
us
to
abandon
,
to
go
from
something
.
The
arts
*NL*
which
excite
them
,
pornographical
or
didactic
,
are
therefore
improper
*NL*
arts
.
The
esthetic
emotion
-LRB-
I
used
the
general
term
-RRB-
is
therefore
*NL*
static
.
The
mind
is
arrested
and
raised
above
desire
and
loathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
say
that
art
must
not
excite
desire
,
said
Lynch
.
I
told
you
that
*NL*
one
day
I
wrote
my
name
in
pencil
on
the
backside
of
the
Venus
of
*NL*
Praxiteles
in
the
Museum
.
Was
that
not
desire
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
speak
of
normal
natures
,
said
Stephen
.
You
also
told
me
that
when
*NL*
you
were
a
boy
in
that
charming
carmelite
school
you
ate
pieces
of
*NL*
dried
cowdung
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lynch
broke
again
into
a
whinny
of
laughter
and
again
rubbed
both
his
*NL*
hands
over
his
groins
but
without
taking
them
from
his
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
I
did
!
I
did
!
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
turned
towards
his
companion
and
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
*NL*
boldly
in
the
eyes
.
Lynch
,
recovering
from
his
laughter
,
answered
his
*NL*
look
from
his
humbled
eyes
.
The
long
slender
flattened
skull
beneath
*NL*
the
long
pointed
cap
brought
before
Stephen
's
mind
the
image
of
a
*NL*
hooded
reptile
.
The
eyes
,
too
,
were
reptile-like
in
glint
and
gaze
.
Yet
*NL*
at
that
instant
,
humbled
and
alert
in
their
look
,
they
were
lit
by
one
*NL*
tiny
human
point
,
the
window
of
a
shrivelled
soul
,
poignant
and
*NL*
self-embittered
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
As
for
that
,
Stephen
said
in
polite
parenthesis
,
we
are
all
animals
.
*NL*
I
also
am
an
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
are
,
said
Lynch
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
we
are
just
now
in
a
mental
world
,
Stephen
continued
.
The
desire
*NL*
and
loathing
excited
by
improper
esthetic
means
are
really
not
esthetic
*NL*
emotions
not
only
because
they
are
kinetic
in
character
but
also
*NL*
because
they
are
not
more
than
physical
.
Our
flesh
shrinks
from
what
it
*NL*
dreads
and
responds
to
the
stimulus
of
what
it
desires
by
a
purely
*NL*
reflex
action
of
the
nervous
system
.
Our
eyelid
closes
before
we
are
*NL*
aware
that
the
fly
is
about
to
enter
our
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
always
,
said
Lynch
critically
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
the
same
way
,
said
Stephen
,
your
flesh
responded
to
the
stimulus
*NL*
of
a
naked
statue
,
but
it
was
,
I
say
,
simply
a
reflex
action
of
the
*NL*
nerves
.
Beauty
expressed
by
the
artist
can
not
awaken
in
us
an
emotion
*NL*
which
is
kinetic
or
a
sensation
which
is
purely
physical
.
It
awakens
,
*NL*
or
ought
to
awaken
,
or
induces
,
or
ought
to
induce
,
an
esthetic
stasis
,
*NL*
an
ideal
pity
or
an
ideal
terror
,
a
stasis
called
forth
,
prolonged
,
and
*NL*
at
last
dissolved
by
what
I
call
the
rhythm
of
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
that
exactly
?
asked
Lynch
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Rhythm
,
said
Stephen
,
is
the
first
formal
esthetic
relation
of
part
*NL*
to
part
in
any
esthetic
whole
or
of
an
esthetic
whole
to
its
part
or
*NL*
parts
or
of
any
part
to
the
esthetic
whole
of
which
it
is
a
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
that
is
rhythm
,
said
Lynch
,
let
me
hear
what
you
call
beauty
;
*NL*
and
,
please
remember
,
though
I
did
eat
a
cake
of
cowdung
once
,
that
I
*NL*
admire
only
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
raised
his
cap
as
if
in
greeting
.
Then
,
blushing
slightly
,
he
*NL*
laid
his
hand
on
Lynch
's
thick
tweed
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
are
right
,
he
said
,
and
the
others
are
wrong
.
To
speak
of
these
*NL*
things
and
to
try
to
understand
their
nature
and
,
having
understood
it
,
*NL*
to
try
slowly
and
humbly
and
constantly
to
express
,
to
press
out
again
,
*NL*
from
the
gross
earth
or
what
it
brings
forth
,
from
sound
and
shape
and
*NL*
colour
which
are
the
prison
gates
of
our
soul
,
an
image
of
the
beauty
*NL*
we
have
come
to
understand
--
that
is
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
reached
the
canal
bridge
and
,
turning
from
their
course
,
went
*NL*
on
by
the
trees
.
A
crude
grey
light
,
mirrored
in
the
sluggish
water
and
*NL*
a
smell
of
wet
branches
over
their
heads
seemed
to
war
against
the
*NL*
course
of
Stephen
's
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
you
have
not
answered
my
question
,
said
Lynch
.
What
is
art
?
What
*NL*
is
the
beauty
it
expresses
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
was
the
first
definition
I
gave
you
,
you
sleepy-headed
wretch
,
*NL*
said
Stephen
,
when
I
began
to
try
to
think
out
the
matter
for
myself
.
*NL*
Do
you
remember
the
night
?
Cranly
lost
his
temper
and
began
to
talk
*NL*
about
Wicklow
bacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
remember
,
said
Lynch
.
He
told
us
about
them
flaming
fat
devils
of
*NL*
pigs
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Art
,
said
Stephen
,
is
the
human
disposition
of
sensible
or
*NL*
intelligible
matter
for
an
esthetic
end
.
You
remember
the
pigs
and
*NL*
forget
that
.
You
are
a
distressing
pair
,
you
and
Cranly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lynch
made
a
grimace
at
the
raw
grey
sky
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
I
am
to
listen
to
your
esthetic
philosophy
give
me
at
least
*NL*
another
cigarette
.
I
do
n't
care
about
it
.
I
do
n't
even
care
about
*NL*
women
.
Damn
you
and
damn
everything
.
I
want
a
job
of
five
hundred
a
*NL*
year
.
You
ca
n't
get
me
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
handed
him
the
packet
of
cigarettes
.
Lynch
took
the
last
one
*NL*
that
remained
,
saying
simply
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Proceed
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Aquinas
,
said
Stephen
,
says
that
is
beautiful
the
apprehension
of
*NL*
which
pleases
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lynch
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
remember
that
,
he
said
,
PULCRA
SUNT
QUAE
VISA
PLACENT
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
uses
the
word
VISA
,
said
Stephen
,
to
cover
esthetic
apprehensions
of
*NL*
all
kinds
,
whether
through
sight
or
hearing
or
through
any
other
avenue
of
*NL*
apprehension
.
This
word
,
though
it
is
vague
,
is
clear
enough
to
keep
*NL*
away
good
and
evil
which
excite
desire
and
loathing
.
It
means
certainly
*NL*
a
stasis
and
not
a
kinesis
.
How
about
the
true
?
It
produces
also
a
*NL*
stasis
of
the
mind
.
You
would
not
write
your
name
in
pencil
across
the
*NL*
hypotenuse
of
a
right-angled
triangle
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
said
Lynch
,
give
me
the
hypotenuse
of
the
Venus
of
Praxiteles
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Static
therefore
,
said
Stephen
.
Plato
,
I
believe
,
said
that
beauty
*NL*
is
the
splendour
of
truth
.
I
do
n't
think
that
it
has
a
meaning
,
but
the
*NL*
true
and
the
beautiful
are
akin
.
Truth
is
beheld
by
the
intellect
which
*NL*
is
appeased
by
the
most
satisfying
relations
of
the
intelligible
;
*NL*
beauty
is
beheld
by
the
imagination
which
is
appeased
by
the
most
*NL*
satisfying
relations
of
the
sensible
.
The
first
step
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
truth
is
to
understand
the
frame
and
scope
of
the
intellect
itself
,
*NL*
to
comprehend
the
act
itself
of
intellection
.
Aristotle
's
entire
system
*NL*
of
philosophy
rests
upon
his
book
of
psychology
and
that
,
I
think
,
*NL*
rests
on
his
statement
that
the
same
attribute
can
not
at
the
same
time
*NL*
and
in
the
same
connexion
belong
to
and
not
belong
to
the
same
subject
.
*NL*
The
first
step
in
the
direction
of
beauty
is
to
understand
the
frame
*NL*
and
scope
of
the
imagination
,
to
comprehend
the
act
itself
of
esthetic
*NL*
apprehension
.
Is
that
clear
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
what
is
beauty
?
asked
Lynch
impatiently
.
Out
with
another
*NL*
definition
.
Something
we
see
and
like
!
Is
that
the
best
you
and
Aquinas
*NL*
can
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
us
take
woman
,
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
us
take
her
!
said
Lynch
fervently
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
Greek
,
the
Turk
,
the
Chinese
,
the
Copt
,
the
Hottentot
,
said
*NL*
Stephen
,
all
admire
a
different
type
of
female
beauty
.
That
seems
*NL*
to
be
a
maze
out
of
which
we
can
not
escape
.
I
see
,
however
,
*NL*
two
ways
out
.
One
is
this
hypothesis
:
that
every
physical
quality
*NL*
admired
by
men
in
women
is
in
direct
connexion
with
the
manifold
*NL*
functions
of
women
for
the
propagation
of
the
species
.
It
may
be
so
.
*NL*
The
world
,
it
seems
,
is
drearier
than
even
you
,
Lynch
,
imagined
.
For
my
*NL*
part
I
dislike
that
way
out
.
It
leads
to
eugenics
rather
than
to
*NL*
esthetic
.
It
leads
you
out
of
the
maze
into
a
new
gaudy
lecture-room
*NL*
where
MacCann
,
with
one
hand
on
THE
ORIGIN
OF
SPECIES
and
the
other
hand
*NL*
on
the
new
testament
,
tells
you
that
you
admired
the
great
flanks
of
*NL*
Venus
because
you
felt
that
she
would
bear
you
burly
offspring
and
*NL*
admired
her
great
breasts
because
you
felt
that
she
would
give
good
*NL*
milk
to
her
children
and
yours
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
MacCann
is
a
sulphur-yellow
liar
,
said
Lynch
energetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
remains
another
way
out
,
said
Stephen
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
wit
?
said
Lynch
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
hypothesis
,
Stephen
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
dray
laden
with
old
iron
came
round
the
corner
of
Sir
Patrick
*NL*
Dun
's
hospital
covering
the
end
of
Stephen
's
speech
with
the
harsh
roar
*NL*
of
jangled
and
rattling
metal
.
Lynch
closed
his
ears
and
gave
out
oath
*NL*
after
oath
till
the
dray
had
passed
.
Then
he
turned
on
his
heel
rudely
.
*NL*
Stephen
turned
also
and
waited
for
a
few
moments
till
his
companion
's
*NL*
ill-humour
had
had
its
vent
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
hypothesis
,
Stephen
repeated
,
is
the
other
way
out
:
that
,
*NL*
though
the
same
object
may
not
seem
beautiful
to
all
people
,
all
people
*NL*
who
admire
a
beautiful
object
find
in
it
certain
relations
which
*NL*
satisfy
and
coincide
with
the
stages
themselves
of
all
esthetic
*NL*
apprehension
.
These
relations
of
the
sensible
,
visible
to
you
through
*NL*
one
form
and
to
me
through
another
,
must
be
therefore
the
necessary
*NL*
qualities
of
beauty
.
Now
,
we
can
return
to
our
old
friend
saint
Thomas
*NL*
for
another
pennyworth
of
wisdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lynch
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
amuses
me
vastly
,
he
said
,
to
hear
you
quoting
him
time
after
*NL*
time
like
a
jolly
round
friar
.
Are
you
laughing
in
your
sleeve
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
MacAlister
,
answered
Stephen
,
would
call
my
esthetic
theory
applied
*NL*
Aquinas
.
So
far
as
this
side
of
esthetic
philosophy
extends
,
Aquinas
*NL*
will
carry
me
all
along
the
line
.
When
we
come
to
the
phenomena
of
*NL*
artistic
conception
,
artistic
gestation
,
and
artistic
reproduction
I
*NL*
require
a
new
terminology
and
a
new
personal
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
course
,
said
Lynch
.
After
all
Aquinas
,
in
spite
of
his
intellect
,
*NL*
was
exactly
a
good
round
friar
.
But
you
will
tell
me
about
the
new
*NL*
personal
experience
and
new
terminology
some
other
day
.
Hurry
up
and
*NL*
finish
the
first
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
knows
?
said
Stephen
,
smiling
.
Perhaps
Aquinas
would
understand
*NL*
me
better
than
you
.
He
was
a
poet
himself
.
He
wrote
a
hymn
for
Maundy
*NL*
Thursday
.
It
begins
with
the
words
PANGE
LINGUA
GLORIOSI
.
They
say
it
*NL*
is
the
highest
glory
of
the
hymnal
.
It
is
an
intricate
and
soothing
*NL*
hymn
.
I
like
it
;
but
there
is
no
hymn
that
can
be
put
beside
that
*NL*
mournful
and
majestic
processional
song
,
the
VEXILLA
REGIS
of
Venantius
*NL*
Fortunatus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lynch
began
to
sing
softly
and
solemnly
in
a
deep
bass
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
IMPLETA
SUNT
QUAE
CONCINIT
*NL*
DAVID
FIDELI
CARMINE
*NL*
DICENDO
NATIONIBUS
*NL*
REGNAVIT
A
LIGNO
DEUS
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
great
!
he
said
,
well
pleased
.
Great
music
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
into
Lower
Mount
Street
.
A
few
steps
from
the
corner
a
fat
*NL*
young
man
,
wearing
a
silk
neckcloth
,
saluted
them
and
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
you
hear
the
results
of
the
exams
?
he
asked
.
Griffin
was
*NL*
plucked
.
Halpin
and
O'Flynn
are
through
the
home
civil
.
Moonan
got
*NL*
fifth
place
in
the
Indian
.
O'Shaughnessy
got
fourteenth
.
The
Irish
*NL*
fellows
in
Clark
's
gave
them
a
feed
last
night
.
They
all
ate
curry
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
pallid
bloated
face
expressed
benevolent
malice
and
,
as
he
had
*NL*
advanced
through
his
tidings
of
success
,
his
small
fat-encircled
eyes
*NL*
vanished
out
of
sight
and
his
weak
wheezing
voice
out
of
hearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
reply
to
a
question
of
Stephen
's
his
eyes
and
his
voice
came
forth
*NL*
again
from
their
lurking-places
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
MacCullagh
and
I
,
he
said
.
He
's
taking
pure
mathematics
and
I
'm
*NL*
taking
constitutional
history
.
There
are
twenty
subjects
.
I
'm
taking
*NL*
botany
too
.
You
know
I
'm
a
member
of
the
field
club
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
back
from
the
other
two
in
a
stately
fashion
and
placed
a
plump
*NL*
woollen-gloved
hand
on
his
breast
from
which
muttered
wheezing
laughter
*NL*
at
once
broke
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bring
us
a
few
turnips
and
onions
the
next
time
you
go
out
,
said
*NL*
Stephen
drily
,
to
make
a
stew
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fat
student
laughed
indulgently
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
are
all
highly
respectable
people
in
the
field
club
.
Last
*NL*
Saturday
we
went
out
to
Glenmalure
,
seven
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
With
women
,
Donovan
?
said
Lynch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Donovan
again
laid
his
hand
on
his
chest
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Our
end
is
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
.
Then
he
said
quickly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
hear
you
are
writing
some
essays
about
esthetics
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
made
a
vague
gesture
of
denial
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Goethe
and
Lessing
,
said
Donovan
,
have
written
a
lot
on
that
*NL*
subject
,
the
classical
school
and
the
romantic
school
and
all
that
.
The
*NL*
Laocoon
interested
me
very
much
when
I
read
it
.
Of
course
it
is
*NL*
idealistic
,
German
,
ultra-profound
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
of
the
others
spoke
.
Donovan
took
leave
of
them
urbanely
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
must
go
,
he
said
softly
and
benevolently
,
I
have
a
strong
*NL*
suspicion
,
amounting
almost
to
a
conviction
,
that
my
sister
intended
to
*NL*
make
pancakes
today
for
the
dinner
of
the
Donovan
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Goodbye
,
Stephen
said
in
his
wake
.
Do
n't
forget
the
turnips
for
me
*NL*
and
my
mate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lynch
gazed
after
him
,
his
lip
curling
in
slow
scorn
till
his
face
*NL*
resembled
a
devil
's
mask
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
think
that
that
yellow
pancake-eating
excrement
can
get
a
good
*NL*
job
,
he
said
at
length
,
and
I
have
to
smoke
cheap
cigarettes
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
their
faces
towards
Merrion
Square
and
went
for
a
little
in
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
finish
what
I
was
saying
about
beauty
,
said
Stephen
,
the
most
*NL*
satisfying
relations
of
the
sensible
must
therefore
correspond
to
the
*NL*
necessary
phases
of
artistic
apprehension
.
Find
these
and
you
find
the
*NL*
qualities
of
universal
beauty
.
Aquinas
says
:
AD
PULCRITUDINEM
TRIA
*NL*
REQUIRUNTUR
INTEGRITAS
,
CONSONANTIA
,
CLARITAS
.
I
translate
it
so
:
THREE
*NL*
THINGS
ARE
NEEDED
FOR
BEAUTY
,
WHOLENESS
,
HARMONY
,
AND
RADIANCE
.
Do
*NL*
these
correspond
to
the
phases
of
apprehension
?
Are
you
following
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
course
,
I
am
,
said
Lynch
.
If
you
think
I
have
an
excrementitious
*NL*
intelligence
run
after
Donovan
and
ask
him
to
listen
to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
pointed
to
a
basket
which
a
butcher
's
boy
had
slung
inverted
on
*NL*
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Look
at
that
basket
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
see
it
,
said
Lynch
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
order
to
see
that
basket
,
said
Stephen
,
your
mind
first
of
all
*NL*
separates
the
basket
from
the
rest
of
the
visible
universe
which
is
not
*NL*
the
basket
.
The
first
phase
of
apprehension
is
a
bounding
line
drawn
*NL*
about
the
object
to
be
apprehended
.
An
esthetic
image
is
presented
to
*NL*
us
either
in
space
or
in
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
audible
is
presented
in
time
,
what
is
visible
is
presented
in
*NL*
space
.
But
,
temporal
or
spatial
,
the
esthetic
image
is
first
luminously
*NL*
apprehended
as
selfbounded
and
selfcontained
upon
the
immeasurable
*NL*
background
of
space
or
time
which
is
not
it
.
You
apprehended
it
as
ONE
*NL*
thing
.
You
see
it
as
one
whole
.
You
apprehend
its
wholeness
.
That
is
*NL*
INTEGRITAS
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bull
's
eye
!
said
Lynch
,
laughing
.
Go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
,
said
Stephen
,
you
pass
from
point
to
point
,
led
by
its
formal
*NL*
lines
;
you
apprehend
it
as
balanced
part
against
part
within
its
*NL*
limits
;
you
feel
the
rhythm
of
its
structure
.
In
other
words
,
the
*NL*
synthesis
of
immediate
perception
is
followed
by
the
analysis
of
*NL*
apprehension
.
Having
first
felt
that
it
is
ONE
thing
you
feel
now
that
*NL*
it
is
a
THING
.
You
apprehend
it
as
complex
,
multiple
,
divisible
,
*NL*
separable
,
made
up
of
its
parts
,
the
result
of
its
parts
and
their
sum
,
*NL*
harmonious
.
That
is
CONSONANTIA
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bull
's
eye
again
!
said
Lynch
wittily
.
Tell
me
now
what
is
CLARITAS
*NL*
and
you
win
the
cigar
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
connotation
of
the
word
,
Stephen
said
,
is
rather
vague
.
Aquinas
*NL*
uses
a
term
which
seems
to
be
inexact
.
It
baffled
me
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
It
would
lead
you
to
believe
that
he
had
in
mind
symbolism
or
idealism
,
*NL*
the
supreme
quality
of
beauty
being
a
light
from
some
other
world
,
the
*NL*
idea
of
which
the
matter
is
but
the
shadow
,
the
reality
of
which
it
is
*NL*
but
the
symbol
.
I
thought
he
might
mean
that
CLARITAS
is
the
artistic
*NL*
discovery
and
representation
of
the
divine
purpose
in
anything
or
a
*NL*
force
of
generalization
which
would
make
the
esthetic
image
a
*NL*
universal
one
,
make
it
outshine
its
proper
conditions
.
But
that
is
*NL*
literary
talk
.
I
understand
it
so
.
When
you
have
apprehended
that
*NL*
basket
as
one
thing
and
have
then
analysed
it
according
to
its
form
and
*NL*
apprehended
it
as
a
thing
you
make
the
only
synthesis
which
is
*NL*
logically
and
esthetically
permissible
.
You
see
that
it
is
that
thing
*NL*
which
it
is
and
no
other
thing
.
The
radiance
of
which
he
speaks
in
the
*NL*
scholastic
QUIDDITAS
,
the
WHATNESS
of
a
thing
.
This
supreme
quality
is
*NL*
felt
by
the
artist
when
the
esthetic
image
is
first
conceived
in
his
*NL*
imagination
.
The
mind
in
that
mysterious
instant
Shelley
likened
*NL*
beautifully
to
a
fading
coal
.
The
instant
wherein
that
supreme
quality
*NL*
of
beauty
,
the
clear
radiance
of
the
esthetic
image
,
is
apprehended
*NL*
luminously
by
the
mind
which
has
been
arrested
by
its
wholeness
and
*NL*
fascinated
by
its
harmony
is
the
luminous
silent
stasis
of
esthetic
*NL*
pleasure
,
a
spiritual
state
very
like
to
that
cardiac
condition
which
*NL*
the
Italian
physiologist
Luigi
Galvani
,
using
a
phrase
almost
as
*NL*
beautiful
as
Shelley
's
,
called
the
enchantment
of
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
paused
and
,
though
his
companion
did
not
speak
,
felt
that
his
*NL*
words
had
called
up
around
them
a
thought-enchanted
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
I
have
said
,
he
began
again
,
refers
to
beauty
in
the
wider
*NL*
sense
of
the
word
,
in
the
sense
which
the
word
has
in
the
literary
*NL*
tradition
.
In
the
marketplace
it
has
another
sense
.
When
we
speak
of
*NL*
beauty
in
the
second
sense
of
the
term
our
judgement
is
influenced
in
*NL*
the
first
place
by
the
art
itself
and
by
the
form
of
that
art
.
The
*NL*
image
,
it
is
clear
,
must
be
set
between
the
mind
or
senses
of
the
*NL*
artist
himself
and
the
mind
or
senses
of
others
.
If
you
bear
this
in
*NL*
memory
you
will
see
that
art
necessarily
divides
itself
into
three
*NL*
forms
progressing
from
one
to
the
next
.
These
forms
are
:
the
lyrical
*NL*
form
,
the
form
wherein
the
artist
presents
his
image
in
immediate
*NL*
relation
to
himself
;
the
epical
form
,
the
form
wherein
he
presents
his
*NL*
image
in
mediate
relation
to
himself
and
to
others
;
the
dramatic
form
,
*NL*
the
form
wherein
he
presents
his
image
in
immediate
relation
to
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
you
told
me
a
few
nights
ago
,
said
Lynch
,
and
we
began
the
*NL*
famous
discussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
a
book
at
home
,
said
Stephen
,
in
which
I
have
written
down
*NL*
questions
which
are
more
amusing
than
yours
were
.
In
finding
the
*NL*
answers
to
them
I
found
the
theory
of
esthetic
which
I
am
trying
to
*NL*
explain
.
Here
are
some
questions
I
set
myself
:
IS
A
CHAIR
FINELY
MADE
*NL*
TRAGIC
OR
COMIC
?
IS
THE
PORTRAIT
OF
MONA
LISA
GOOD
IF
I
DESIRE
TO
SEE
*NL*
IT
?
IF
NOT
,
WHY
NOT
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
not
,
indeed
?
said
Lynch
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
IF
A
MAN
HACKING
IN
FURY
AT
A
BLOCK
OF
WOOD
,
Stephen
continued
,
MAKE
*NL*
THERE
AN
IMAGE
OF
A
COW
,
IS
THAT
IMAGE
A
WORK
OF
ART
?
IF
NOT
,
WHY
NOT
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
a
lovely
one
,
said
Lynch
,
laughing
again
.
That
has
the
true
*NL*
scholastic
stink
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Lessing
,
said
Stephen
,
should
not
have
taken
a
group
of
statues
to
*NL*
write
of
.
The
art
,
being
inferior
,
does
not
present
the
forms
I
spoke
*NL*
of
distinguished
clearly
one
from
another
.
Even
in
literature
,
the
*NL*
highest
and
most
spiritual
art
,
the
forms
are
often
confused
.
The
*NL*
lyrical
form
is
in
fact
the
simplest
verbal
vesture
of
an
instant
of
*NL*
emotion
,
a
rhythmical
cry
such
as
ages
ago
cheered
on
the
man
who
pulled
*NL*
at
the
oar
or
dragged
stones
up
a
slope
.
He
who
utters
it
is
more
*NL*
conscious
of
the
instant
of
emotion
than
of
himself
as
feeling
emotion
.
*NL*
The
simplest
epical
form
is
seen
emerging
out
of
lyrical
literature
*NL*
when
the
artist
prolongs
and
broods
upon
himself
as
the
centre
of
an
*NL*
epical
event
and
this
form
progresses
till
the
centre
of
emotional
*NL*
gravity
is
equidistant
from
the
artist
himself
and
from
others
.
The
*NL*
narrative
is
no
longer
purely
personal
.
The
personality
of
the
artist
*NL*
passes
into
the
narration
itself
,
flowing
round
and
round
the
persons
*NL*
and
the
action
like
a
vital
sea
.
This
progress
you
will
see
easily
in
*NL*
that
old
English
ballad
TURPIN
HERO
which
begins
in
the
first
person
*NL*
and
ends
in
the
third
person
.
The
dramatic
form
is
reached
when
the
*NL*
vitality
which
has
flowed
and
eddied
round
each
person
fills
every
*NL*
person
with
such
vital
force
that
he
or
she
assumes
a
proper
and
*NL*
intangible
esthetic
life
.
The
personality
of
the
artist
,
at
first
a
cry
*NL*
or
a
cadence
or
a
mood
and
then
a
fluid
and
lambent
narrative
,
finally
*NL*
refines
itself
out
of
existence
,
impersonalizes
itself
,
so
to
speak
.
*NL*
The
esthetic
image
in
the
dramatic
form
is
life
purified
in
and
*NL*
reprojected
from
the
human
imagination
.
The
mystery
of
esthetic
,
like
*NL*
that
of
material
creation
,
is
accomplished
.
The
artist
,
like
the
God
of
*NL*
creation
,
remains
within
or
behind
or
beyond
or
above
his
handiwork
,
*NL*
invisible
,
refined
out
of
existence
,
indifferent
,
paring
his
*NL*
fingernails
.

Trying

refine
them

out
of
existence
,
said
Lynch
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fine
rain
began
to
fall
from
the
high
veiled
sky
and
they
turned
into
*NL*
the
duke
's
lawn
to
reach
the
national
library
before
the
shower
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
do
you
mean
,
Lynch
asked
surlily
,
by
prating
about
beauty
and
*NL*
the
imagination
in
this
miserable
Godforsaken
island
?
No
wonder
the
*NL*
artist
retired
within
or
behind
his
handiwork
after
having
perpetrated
*NL*
this
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
fell
faster
.
When
they
passed
through
the
passage
beside
*NL*
Kildare
house
they
found
many
students
sheltering
under
the
arcade
of
*NL*
the
library
.
Cranly
,
leaning
against
a
pillar
,
was
picking
his
teeth
*NL*
with
a
sharpened
match
,
listening
to
some
companions
.
Some
girls
stood
*NL*
near
the
entrance
door
.
Lynch
whispered
to
Stephen
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Your
beloved
is
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
took
his
place
silently
on
the
step
below
the
group
of
*NL*
students
,
heedless
of
the
rain
which
fell
fast
,
turning
his
eyes
*NL*
towards
her
from
time
to
time
.
She
too
stood
silently
among
her
*NL*
companions
.
She
has
no
priest
to
flirt
with
,
he
thought
with
conscious
*NL*
bitterness
,
remembering
how
he
had
seen
her
last
.
Lynch
was
right
.
His
*NL*
mind
emptied
of
theory
and
courage
,
lapsed
back
into
a
listless
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
the
students
talking
among
themselves
.
They
spoke
of
two
*NL*
friends
who
had
passed
the
final
medical
examination
,
of
the
chances
of
*NL*
getting
places
on
ocean
liners
,
of
poor
and
rich
practices
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
all
a
bubble
.
An
Irish
country
practice
is
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hynes
was
two
years
in
Liverpool
and
he
says
the
same
.
A
frightful
*NL*
hole
he
said
it
was
.
Nothing
but
midwifery
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
mean
to
say
it
is
better
to
have
a
job
here
in
the
country
*NL*
than
in
a
rich
city
like
that
?
I
know
a
fellow
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hynes
has
no
brains
.
He
got
through
by
stewing
,
pure
stewing
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
n't
mind
him
.
There
's
plenty
of
money
to
be
made
in
a
big
commercial
*NL*
city

*NL*
Their
voices
reached
his
ears
as
if
from
a
distance
in
interrupted
*NL*
pulsation
.
She
was
preparing
to
go
away
with
her
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quick
light
shower
had
drawn
off
,
tarrying
in
clusters
of
diamonds
*NL*
among
the
shrubs
of
the
quadrangle
where
an
exhalation
was
breathed
*NL*
forth
by
the
blackened
earth
.
Their
trim
boots
prattled
as
they
stood
*NL*
on
the
steps
of
the
colonnade
,
talking
quietly
and
gaily
,
glancing
at
*NL*
the
clouds
,
holding
their
umbrellas
at
cunning
angles
against
the
few
*NL*
last
raindrops
,
closing
them
again
,
holding
their
skirts
demurely
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
he
had
judged
her
harshly
?
If
her
life
were
a
simple
rosary
of
*NL*
hours
,
her
life
simple
and
strange
as
a
bird
's
life
,
gay
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
restless
all
day
,
tired
at
sundown
?
Her
heart
simple
and
*NL*
wilful
as
a
bird
's
heart
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
dawn
he
awoke
.
O
what
sweet
music
!
His
soul
was
all
dewy
wet
.
*NL*
Over
his
limbs
in
sleep
pale
cool
waves
of
light
had
passed
.
He
lay
*NL*
still
,
as
if
his
soul
lay
amid
cool
waters
,
conscious
of
faint
sweet
*NL*
music
.
His
mind
was
waking
slowly
to
a
tremulous
morning
knowledge
,
a
*NL*
morning
inspiration
.
A
spirit
filled
him
,
pure
as
the
purest
water
,
*NL*
sweet
as
dew
,
moving
as
music
.
But
how
faintly
it
was
inbreathed
,
how
*NL*
passionlessly
,
as
if
the
seraphim
themselves
were
breathing
upon
him
!
*NL*
His
soul
was
waking
slowly
,
fearing
to
awake
wholly
.
It
was
that
*NL*
windless
hour
of
dawn
when
madness
wakes
and
strange
plants
open
to
the
*NL*
light
and
the
moth
flies
forth
silently
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
enchantment
of
the
heart
!
The
night
had
been
enchanted
.
In
a
dream
*NL*
or
vision
he
had
known
the
ecstasy
of
seraphic
life
.
Was
it
an
instant
*NL*
of
enchantment
only
or
long
hours
and
years
and
ages
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
of
inspiration
seemed
now
to
be
reflected
from
all
sides
at
*NL*
once
from
a
multitude
of
cloudy
circumstances
of
what
had
happened
or
*NL*
of
what
might
have
happened
.
The
instant
flashed
forth
like
a
point
of
*NL*
light
and
now
from
cloud
on
cloud
of
vague
circumstance
confused
form
*NL*
was
veiling
softly
its
afterglow
.
O
!
In
the
virgin
womb
of
the
*NL*
imagination
the
word
was
made
flesh
.
Gabriel
the
seraph
had
come
to
the
*NL*
virgin
's
chamber
.
An
afterglow
deepened
within
his
spirit
,
whence
the
*NL*
white
flame
had
passed
,
deepening
to
a
rose
and
ardent
light
.
That
rose
*NL*
and
ardent
light
was
her
strange
wilful
heart
,
strange
that
no
man
had
*NL*
known
or
would
know
,
wilful
from
before
the
beginning
of
the
world
;
and
*NL*
lured
by
that
ardent
rose-like
glow
the
choirs
of
the
seraphim
were
*NL*
falling
from
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Are
you
not
weary
of
ardent
ways
,
*NL*
Lure
of
the
fallen
seraphim
?
*NL*
Tell
no
more
of
enchanted
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
verses
passed
from
his
mind
to
his
lips
and
,
murmuring
them
over
,
*NL*
he
felt
the
rhythmic
movement
of
a
villanelle
pass
through
them
.
The
*NL*
rose-like
glow
sent
forth
its
rays
of
rhyme
;
ways
,
days
,
blaze
,
praise
,
*NL*
raise
.
Its
rays
burned
up
the
world
,
consumed
the
hearts
of
men
and
*NL*
angels
:
the
rays
from
the
rose
that
was
her
wilful
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
eyes
have
set
man
's
heart
ablaze
*NL*
And
you
have
had
your
will
of
him
.
*NL*
Are
you
not
weary
of
ardent
ways
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
?
The
rhythm
died
away
,
ceased
,
began
again
to
move
and
beat
.
*NL*
And
then
?
Smoke
,
incense
ascending
from
the
altar
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Above
the
flame
the
smoke
of
praise
*NL*
Goes
up
from
ocean
rim
to
rim
*NL*
Tell
no
more
of
enchanted
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smoke
went
up
from
the
whole
earth
,
from
the
vapoury
oceans
,
smoke
of
*NL*
her
praise
.
The
earth
was
like
a
swinging
swaying
censer
,
a
ball
of
*NL*
incense
,
an
ellipsoidal
fall
.
The
rhythm
died
out
at
once
;
the
cry
of
*NL*
his
heart
was
broken
.
His
lips
began
to
murmur
the
first
verses
over
*NL*
and
over
;
then
went
on
stumbling
through
half
verses
,
stammering
and
*NL*
baffled
;
then
stopped
.
The
heart
's
cry
was
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
veiled
windless
hour
had
passed
and
behind
the
panes
of
the
naked
*NL*
window
the
morning
light
was
gathering
.
A
bell
beat
faintly
very
far
*NL*
away
.
A
bird
twittered
;
two
birds
,
three
.
The
bell
and
the
bird
ceased
;
*NL*
and
the
dull
white
light
spread
itself
east
and
west
,
covering
the
*NL*
world
,
covering
the
roselight
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fearing
to
lose
all
,
he
raised
himself
suddenly
on
his
elbow
to
look
*NL*
for
paper
and
pencil
.
There
was
neither
on
the
table
;
only
the
soup
*NL*
plate
he
had
eaten
the
rice
from
for
supper
and
the
candlestick
with
*NL*
its
tendrils
of
tallow
and
its
paper
socket
,
singed
by
the
last
flame
.
*NL*
He
stretched
his
arm
wearily
towards
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
groping
with
*NL*
his
hand
in
the
pockets
of
the
coat
that
hung
there
.
His
fingers
found
*NL*
a
pencil
and
then
a
cigarette
packet
.
He
lay
back
and
,
tearing
open
the
*NL*
packet
,
placed
the
last
cigarette
on
the
window
ledge
and
began
to
*NL*
write
out
the
stanzas
of
the
villanelle
in
small
neat
letters
on
the
*NL*
rough
cardboard
surface
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
written
them
out
he
lay
back
on
the
lumpy
pillow
,
murmuring
them
*NL*
again
.
The
lumps
of
knotted
flock
under
his
head
reminded
him
of
the
*NL*
lumps
of
knotted
horsehair
in
the
sofa
of
her
parlour
on
which
he
used
*NL*
to
sit
,
smiling
or
serious
,
asking
himself
why
he
had
come
,
displeased
*NL*
with
her
and
with
himself
,
confounded
by
the
print
of
the
Sacred
Heart
*NL*
above
the
untenanted
sideboard
.
He
saw
her
approach
him
in
a
lull
of
*NL*
the
talk
and
beg
him
to
sing
one
of
his
curious
songs
.
Then
he
saw
*NL*
himself
sitting
at
the
old
piano
,
striking
chords
softly
from
its
*NL*
speckled
keys
and
singing
,
amid
the
talk
which
had
risen
again
in
the
*NL*
room
,
to
her
who
leaned
beside
the
mantelpiece
a
dainty
song
of
the
*NL*
Elizabethans
,
a
sad
and
sweet
loth
to
depart
,
the
victory
chant
of
*NL*
Agincourt
,
the
happy
air
of
Greensleeves
.
While
he
sang
and
she
*NL*
listened
,
or
feigned
to
listen
,
his
heart
was
at
rest
but
when
the
*NL*
quaint
old
songs
had
ended
and
he
heard
again
the
voices
in
the
room
he
*NL*
remembered
his
own
sarcasm
:
the
house
where
young
men
are
called
by
*NL*
their
christian
names
a
little
too
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
certain
instants
her
eyes
seemed
about
to
trust
him
but
he
had
*NL*
waited
in
vain
.
She
passed
now
dancing
lightly
across
his
memory
as
she
*NL*
had
been
that
night
at
the
carnival
ball
,
her
white
dress
a
little
*NL*
lifted
,
a
white
spray
nodding
in
her
hair
.
She
danced
lightly
in
the
*NL*
round
.
She
was
dancing
towards
him
and
,
as
she
came
,
her
eyes
were
a
*NL*
little
averted
and
a
faint
glow
was
on
her
cheek
.
At
the
pause
in
the
*NL*
chain
of
hands
her
hand
had
lain
in
his
an
instant
,
a
soft
merchandise
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
are
a
great
stranger
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
.
I
was
born
to
be
a
monk
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
afraid
you
are
a
heretic
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
much
afraid
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
answer
she
had
danced
away
from
him
along
the
chain
of
hands
,
*NL*
dancing
lightly
and
discreetly
,
giving
herself
to
none
.
The
white
spray
*NL*
nodded
to
her
dancing
and
when
she
was
in
shadow
the
glow
was
deeper
on
*NL*
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
monk
!
His
own
image
started
forth
a
profaner
of
the
cloister
,
a
*NL*
heretic
franciscan
,
willing
and
willing
not
to
serve
,
spinning
like
*NL*
Gherardino
da
Borgo
San
Donnino
,
a
lithe
web
of
sophistry
and
*NL*
whispering
in
her
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
it
was
not
his
image
.
It
was
like
the
image
of
the
young
priest
in
*NL*
whose
company
he
had
seen
her
last
,
looking
at
him
out
of
dove
's
eyes
,
*NL*
toying
with
the
pages
of
her
Irish
phrase-book
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
yes
,
the
ladies
are
coming
round
to
us
.
I
can
see
it
every
day
.
*NL*
The
ladies
are
with
us
.
The
best
helpers
the
language
has
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
the
church
,
Father
Moran
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
church
too
.
Coming
round
too
.
The
work
is
going
ahead
there
too
.
*NL*
Do
n't
fret
about
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bah
!
he
had
done
well
to
leave
the
room
in
disdain
.
He
had
done
well
*NL*
not
to
salute
her
on
the
steps
of
the
library
!
He
had
done
well
to
*NL*
leave
her
to
flirt
with
her
priest
,
to
toy
with
a
church
which
was
the
*NL*
scullery-maid
of
christendom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rude
brutal
anger
routed
the
last
lingering
instant
of
ecstasy
from
his
*NL*
soul
.
It
broke
up
violently
her
fair
image
and
flung
the
fragments
on
*NL*
all
sides
.
On
all
sides
distorted
reflections
of
her
image
started
from
*NL*
his
memory
:
the
flower
girl
in
the
ragged
dress
with
damp
coarse
hair
*NL*
and
a
hoyden
's
face
who
had
called
herself
his
own
girl
and
begged
his
*NL*
handsel
,
the
kitchen-girl
in
the
next
house
who
sang
over
the
clatter
*NL*
of
her
plates
,
with
the
drawl
of
a
country
singer
,
the
first
bars
of
BY
*NL*
KILLARNEY
'S
LAKES
AND
FELLS
,
a
girl
who
had
laughed
gaily
to
see
him
*NL*
stumble
when
the
iron
grating
in
the
footpath
near
Cork
Hill
had
caught
*NL*
the
broken
sole
of
his
shoe
,
a
girl
he
had
glanced
at
,
attracted
by
her
*NL*
small
ripe
mouth
,
as
she
passed
out
of
Jacob
's
biscuit
factory
,
who
had
*NL*
cried
to
him
over
her
shoulder
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
like
what
you
seen
of
me
,
straight
hair
and
curly
eyebrows
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
felt
that
,
however
he
might
revile
and
mock
her
image
,
his
*NL*
anger
was
also
a
form
of
homage
.
He
had
left
the
classroom
in
disdain
*NL*
that
was
not
wholly
sincere
,
feeling
that
perhaps
the
secret
of
her
*NL*
race
lay
behind
those
dark
eyes
upon
which
her
long
lashes
flung
a
*NL*
quick
shadow
.
He
had
told
himself
bitterly
as
he
walked
through
the
*NL*
streets
that
she
was
a
figure
of
the
womanhood
of
her
country
,
a
bat-like
*NL*
soul
waking
to
the
consciousness
of
itself
in
darkness
and
secrecy
and
*NL*
loneliness
,
tarrying
awhile
,
loveless
and
sinless
,
with
her
mild
lover
and
*NL*
leaving
him
to
whisper
of
innocent
transgressions
in
the
latticed
ear
of
a
*NL*
priest
.
His
anger
against
her
found
vent
in
coarse
railing
at
her
*NL*
paramour
,
whose
name
and
voice
and
features
offended
his
baffled
pride
:
a
*NL*
priested
peasant
,
with
a
brother
a
policeman
in
Dublin
and
a
brother
a
*NL*
potboy
in
Moycullen
.
To
him
she
would
unveil
her
soul
's
shy
nakedness
,
to
*NL*
one
who
was
but
schooled
in
the
discharging
of
a
formal
rite
rather
than
*NL*
to
him
,
a
priest
of
the
eternal
imagination
,
transmuting
the
daily
bread
*NL*
of
experience
into
the
radiant
body
of
everliving
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
radiant
image
of
the
eucharist
united
again
in
an
instant
his
*NL*
bitter
and
despairing
thoughts
,
their
cries
arising
unbroken
in
a
hymn
*NL*
of
thanksgiving
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
broken
cries
and
mournful
lays
*NL*
Rise
in
one
eucharistic
hymn
*NL*
Are
you
not
weary
of
ardent
ways
?
*NL*
*NL*
While
sacrificing
hands
upraise
*NL*
The
chalice
flowing
to
the
brim
.
*NL*
Tell
no
more
of
enchanted
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
the
verses
aloud
from
the
first
lines
till
the
music
and
*NL*
rhythm
suffused
his
mind
,
turning
it
to
quiet
indulgence
;
then
copied
*NL*
them
painfully
to
feel
them
the
better
by
seeing
them
;
then
lay
back
on
*NL*
his
bolster
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
full
morning
light
had
come
.
No
sound
was
to
be
heard
;
but
he
knew
*NL*
that
all
around
him
life
was
about
to
awaken
in
common
noises
,
hoarse
*NL*
voices
,
sleepy
prayers
.
Shrinking
from
that
life
he
turned
towards
the
*NL*
wall
,
making
a
cowl
of
the
blanket
and
staring
at
the
great
overblown
*NL*
scarlet
flowers
of
the
tattered
wallpaper
.
He
tried
to
warm
his
*NL*
perishing
joy
in
their
scarlet
glow
,
imagining
a
roseway
from
where
he
*NL*
lay
upwards
to
heaven
all
strewn
with
scarlet
flowers
.
Weary
!
Weary
!
He
*NL*
too
was
weary
of
ardent
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gradual
warmth
,
a
languorous
weariness
passed
over
him
descending
*NL*
along
his
spine
from
his
closely
cowled
head
.
He
felt
it
descend
and
,
*NL*
seeing
himself
as
he
lay
,
smiled
.
Soon
he
would
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
written
verses
for
her
again
after
ten
years
.
Ten
years
before
*NL*
she
had
worn
her
shawl
cowlwise
about
her
head
,
sending
sprays
of
her
*NL*
warm
breath
into
the
night
air
,
tapping
her
foot
upon
the
glassy
road
.
*NL*
It
was
the
last
tram
;
the
lank
brown
horses
knew
it
and
shook
their
*NL*
bells
to
the
clear
night
in
admonition
.
The
conductor
talked
with
the
*NL*
driver
,
both
nodding
often
in
the
green
light
of
the
lamp
.
They
stood
*NL*
on
the
steps
of
the
tram
,
he
on
the
upper
,
she
on
the
lower
.
She
came
*NL*
up
to
his
step
many
times
between
their
phrases
and
went
down
again
and
*NL*
once
or
twice
remained
beside
him
forgetting
to
go
down
and
then
went
*NL*
down
.
Let
be
!
Let
be
!
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
years
from
that
wisdom
of
children
to
his
folly
.
If
he
sent
her
the
*NL*
verses
?
They
would
be
read
out
at
breakfast
amid
the
tapping
of
*NL*
egg-shells
.
Folly
indeed
!
Her
brothers
would
laugh
and
try
to
wrest
the
*NL*
page
from
each
other
with
their
strong
hard
fingers
.
The
suave
priest
,
*NL*
her
uncle
,
seated
in
his
arm-chair
,
would
hold
the
page
at
arm
's
*NL*
length
,
read
it
smiling
and
approve
of
the
literary
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
no
;
that
was
folly
.
Even
if
he
sent
her
the
verses
she
would
not
*NL*
show
them
to
others
.
No
,
no
;
she
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
feel
that
he
had
wronged
her
.
A
sense
of
her
innocence
*NL*
moved
him
almost
to
pity
her
,
an
innocence
he
had
never
understood
till
*NL*
he
had
come
to
the
knowledge
of
it
through
sin
,
an
innocence
which
she
*NL*
too
had
not
understood
while
she
was
innocent
or
before
the
strange
*NL*
humiliation
of
her
nature
had
first
come
upon
her
.
Then
first
her
soul
*NL*
had
begun
to
live
as
his
soul
had
when
he
had
first
sinned
,
and
a
*NL*
tender
compassion
filled
his
heart
as
he
remembered
her
frail
pallor
*NL*
and
her
eyes
,
humbled
and
saddened
by
the
dark
shame
of
womanhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
his
soul
had
passed
from
ecstasy
to
languor
where
had
she
been
?
*NL*
Might
it
be
,
in
the
mysterious
ways
of
spiritual
life
,
that
her
soul
at
*NL*
those
same
moments
had
been
conscious
of
his
homage
?
It
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
glow
of
desire
kindled
again
his
soul
and
fired
and
fulfilled
all
his
*NL*
body
.
Conscious
of
his
desire
she
was
waking
from
odorous
sleep
,
the
*NL*
temptress
of
his
villanelle
.
Her
eyes
,
dark
and
with
a
look
of
languor
,
*NL*
were
opening
to
his
eyes
.
Her
nakedness
yielded
to
him
,
radiant
,
warm
,
*NL*
odorous
and
lavish-limbed
,
enfolded
him
like
a
shining
cloud
,
enfolded
*NL*
him
like
water
with
a
liquid
life
;
and
like
a
cloud
of
vapour
or
like
*NL*
waters
circumfluent
in
space
the
liquid
letters
of
speech
,
symbols
of
*NL*
the
element
of
mystery
,
flowed
forth
over
his
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Are
you
not
weary
of
ardent
ways
,
*NL*
Lure
of
the
fallen
seraphim
?
*NL*
Tell
no
more
of
enchanted
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
eyes
have
set
man
's
heart
ablaze
*NL*
And
you
have
had
your
will
of
him
.
*NL*
Are
you
not
weary
of
ardent
ways
?
*NL*
*NL*
Above
the
flame
the
smoke
of
praise
*NL*
Goes
up
from
ocean
rim
to
rim
.
*NL*
Tell
no
more
of
enchanted
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
broken
cries
and
mournful
lays
*NL*
Rise
in
one
eucharistic

Are

*NL*
*NL*
While

*NL*
The
chalice
flowing
to
the
brim
.
*NL*
Tell
no

of

days
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
still
you
hold
our
longing
gaze
*NL*
With
languorous
look
and
lavish
limb
!
*NL*
Are
you
not
weary
of
ardent
ways

What
birds
were
they
?
He
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
library
to
look
at
*NL*
them
,
leaning
wearily
on
his
ashplant
.
They
flew
round
and
round
the
*NL*
jutting
shoulder
of
a
house
in
Molesworth
Street
.
The
air
of
the
late
*NL*
March
evening
made
clear
their
flight
,
their
dark
quivering
bodies
*NL*
flying
clearly
against
the
sky
as
against
a
limp-hung
cloth
of
smoky
*NL*
tenuous
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
their
flight
;
bird
after
bird
:
a
dark
flash
,
a
swerve
,
a
*NL*
flutter
of
wings
.
He
tried
to
count
them
before
all
their
darting
*NL*
quivering
bodies
passed
:
six
,
ten
,
eleven
:
and
wondered
were
they
odd
*NL*
or
even
in
number
.
Twelve
,
thirteen
:
for
two
came
wheeling
down
from
the
*NL*
upper
sky
.
They
were
flying
high
and
low
but
ever
round
and
round
in
*NL*
straight
and
curving
lines
and
ever
flying
from
left
to
right
,
circling
*NL*
about
a
temple
of
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
to
the
cries
:
like
the
squeak
of
mice
behind
the
wainscot
:
*NL*
a
shrill
twofold
note
.
But
the
notes
were
long
and
shrill
and
whirring
,
*NL*
unlike
the
cry
of
vermin
,
falling
a
third
or
a
fourth
and
trilled
as
*NL*
the
flying
beaks
clove
the
air
.
Their
cry
was
shrill
and
clear
and
fine
*NL*
and
falling
like
threads
of
silken
light
unwound
from
whirring
spools
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inhuman
clamour
soothed
his
ears
in
which
his
mother
's
sobs
and
*NL*
reproaches
murmured
insistently
and
the
dark
frail
quivering
bodies
*NL*
wheeling
and
fluttering
and
swerving
round
an
airy
temple
of
the
*NL*
tenuous
sky
soothed
his
eyes
which
still
saw
the
image
of
his
mother
's
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
was
he
gazing
upwards
from
the
steps
of
the
porch
,
hearing
their
*NL*
shrill
twofold
cry
,
watching
their
flight
?
For
an
augury
of
good
or
*NL*
evil
?
A
phrase
of
Cornelius
Agrippa
flew
through
his
mind
and
then
*NL*
there
flew
hither
and
thither
shapeless
thoughts
from
Swedenborg
on
the
*NL*
correspondence
of
birds
to
things
of
the
intellect
and
of
how
the
*NL*
creatures
of
the
air
have
their
knowledge
and
know
their
times
and
*NL*
seasons
because
they
,
unlike
man
,
are
in
the
order
of
their
life
and
*NL*
have
not
perverted
that
order
by
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
for
ages
men
had
gazed
upward
as
he
was
gazing
at
birds
in
flight
.
*NL*
The
colonnade
above
him
made
him
think
vaguely
of
an
ancient
temple
and
*NL*
the
ashplant
on
which
he
leaned
wearily
of
the
curved
stick
of
an
*NL*
augur
.
A
sense
of
fear
of
the
unknown
moved
in
the
heart
of
his
*NL*
weariness
,
a
fear
of
symbols
and
portents
,
of
the
hawk-like
man
whose
*NL*
name
he
bore
soaring
out
of
his
captivity
on
osier-woven
wings
,
of
*NL*
Thoth
,
the
god
of
writers
,
writing
with
a
reed
upon
a
tablet
and
*NL*
bearing
on
his
narrow
ibis
head
the
cusped
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
as
he
thought
of
the
god
's
image
for
it
made
him
think
of
a
*NL*
bottle-nosed
judge
in
a
wig
,
putting
commas
into
a
document
which
he
*NL*
held
at
arm
's
length
,
and
he
knew
that
he
would
not
have
remembered
the
*NL*
god
's
name
but
that
it
was
like
an
Irish
oath
.
It
was
folly
.
But
was
it
*NL*
for
this
folly
that
he
was
about
to
leave
for
ever
the
house
of
prayer
*NL*
and
prudence
into
which
he
had
been
born
and
the
order
of
life
out
of
*NL*
which
he
had
come
?
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
back
with
shrill
cries
over
the
jutting
shoulder
of
the
*NL*
house
,
flying
darkly
against
the
fading
air
.
What
birds
were
they
?
He
*NL*
thought
that
they
must
be
swallows
who
had
come
back
from
the
south
.
*NL*
Then
he
was
to
go
away
for
they
were
birds
ever
going
and
coming
,
*NL*
building
ever
an
unlasting
home
under
the
eaves
of
men
's
houses
and
*NL*
ever
leaving
the
homes
they
had
built
to
wander
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bend
down
your
faces
,
Oona
and
Aleel
.
*NL*
I
gaze
upon
them
as
the
swallow
gazes
*NL*
Upon
the
nest
under
the
eave
before
*NL*
He
wander
the
loud
waters
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
soft
liquid
joy
like
the
noise
of
many
waters
flowed
over
his
memory
*NL*
and
he
felt
in
his
heart
the
soft
peace
of
silent
spaces
of
fading
*NL*
tenuous
sky
above
the
waters
,
of
oceanic
silence
,
of
swallows
flying
*NL*
through
the
sea-dusk
over
the
flowing
waters
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
soft
liquid
joy
flowed
through
the
words
where
the
soft
long
vowels
*NL*
hurtled
noiselessly
and
fell
away
,
lapping
and
flowing
back
and
ever
*NL*
shaking
the
white
bells
of
their
waves
in
mute
chime
and
mute
peal
,
and
*NL*
soft
low
swooning
cry
;
and
he
felt
that
the
augury
he
had
sought
in
the
*NL*
wheeling
darting
birds
and
in
the
pale
space
of
sky
above
him
had
come
*NL*
forth
from
his
heart
like
a
bird
from
a
turret
,
quietly
and
swiftly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Symbol
of
departure
or
of
loneliness
?
The
verses
crooned
in
the
ear
of
*NL*
his
memory
composed
slowly
before
his
remembering
eyes
the
scene
of
the
*NL*
hall
on
the
night
of
the
opening
of
the
national
theatre
.
He
was
alone
*NL*
at
the
side
of
the
balcony
,
looking
out
of
jaded
eyes
at
the
culture
of
*NL*
Dublin
in
the
stalls
and
at
the
tawdry
scene-cloths
and
human
dolls
*NL*
framed
by
the
garish
lamps
of
the
stage
.
A
burly
policeman
sweated
behind
*NL*
him
and
seemed
at
every
moment
about
to
act
.
The
catcalls
and
hisses
and
*NL*
mocking
cries
ran
in
rude
gusts
round
the
hall
from
his
scattered
fellow
*NL*
students
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
libel
on
Ireland
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Made
in
Germany
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Blasphemy
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
never
sold
our
faith
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
Irish
woman
ever
did
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
want
no
amateur
atheists
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
want
no
budding
buddhists
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
swift
hiss
fell
from
the
windows
above
him
and
he
knew
that
*NL*
the
electric
lamps
had
been
switched
on
in
the
reader
's
room
.
He
turned
*NL*
into
the
pillared
hall
,
now
calmly
lit
,
went
up
the
staircase
and
*NL*
passed
in
through
the
clicking
turnstile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
was
sitting
over
near
the
dictionaries
.
A
thick
book
,
opened
at
*NL*
the
frontispiece
,
lay
before
him
on
the
wooden
rest
.
He
leaned
back
in
*NL*
his
chair
,
inclining
his
ear
like
that
of
a
confessor
to
the
face
of
*NL*
the
medical
student
who
was
reading
to
him
a
problem
from
the
chess
*NL*
page
of
a
journal
.
Stephen
sat
down
at
his
right
and
the
priest
at
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
table
closed
his
copy
of
THE
TABLET
with
an
angry
*NL*
snap
and
stood
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
gazed
after
him
blandly
and
vaguely
.
The
medical
student
went
on
*NL*
in
a
softer
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pawn
to
king
's
fourth
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
had
better
go
,
Dixon
,
said
Stephen
in
warning
.
He
has
gone
to
*NL*
complain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dixon
folded
the
journal
and
rose
with
dignity
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Our
men
retired
in
good
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
With
guns
and
cattle
,
added
Stephen
,
pointing
to
the
titlepage
of
*NL*
Cranly
's
book
on
which
was
printed
DISEASES
OF
THE
OX
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
passed
through
a
lane
of
the
tables
Stephen
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Cranly
,
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
did
not
answer
or
turn
.
He
laid
his
book
on
the
counter
and
*NL*
passed
out
,
his
well-shod
feet
sounding
flatly
on
the
floor
.
On
the
*NL*
staircase
he
paused
and
gazing
absently
at
Dixon
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pawn
to
king
's
bloody
fourth
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Put
it
that
way
if
you
like
,
Dixon
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
quiet
toneless
voice
and
urbane
manners
and
on
a
finger
of
his
*NL*
plump
clean
hand
he
displayed
at
moments
a
signet
ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
crossed
the
hall
a
man
of
dwarfish
stature
came
towards
them
.
*NL*
Under
the
dome
of
his
tiny
hat
his
unshaven
face
began
to
smile
with
*NL*
pleasure
and
he
was
heard
to
murmur
.
The
eyes
were
melancholy
as
those
*NL*
of
a
monkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
evening
,
gentlemen
,
said
the
stubble-grown
monkeyish
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Warm
weather
for
March
,
said
Cranly
.
They
have
the
windows
open
*NL*
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dixon
smiled
and
turned
his
ring
.
The
blackish
,
monkey-puckered
face
*NL*
pursed
its
human
mouth
with
gentle
pleasure
and
its
voice
purred
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Delightful
weather
for
March
.
Simply
delightful
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
are
two
nice
young
ladies
upstairs
,
captain
,
tired
of
waiting
,
*NL*
Dixon
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
smiled
and
said
kindly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
captain
has
only
one
love
:
sir
Walter
Scott
.
Is
n't
that
so
,
*NL*
captain
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
are
you
reading
now
,
captain
?
Dixon
asked
.
THE
BRIDE
OF
*NL*
LAMMERMOOR
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
love
old
Scott
,
the
flexible
lips
said
,
I
think
he
writes
something
*NL*
lovely
.
There
is
no
writer
can
touch
sir
Walter
Scott
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
a
thin
shrunken
brown
hand
gently
in
the
air
in
time
to
his
*NL*
praise
and
his
thin
quick
eyelids
beat
often
over
his
sad
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sadder
to
Stephen
's
ear
was
his
speech
:
a
genteel
accent
,
low
and
*NL*
moist
,
marred
by
errors
,
and
,
listening
to
it
,
he
wondered
was
the
*NL*
story
true
and
was
the
thin
blood
that
flowed
in
his
shrunken
frame
*NL*
noble
and
come
of
an
incestuous
love
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
park
trees
were
heavy
with
rain
;
and
rain
fell
still
and
ever
in
*NL*
the
lake
,
lying
grey
like
a
shield
.
A
game
of
swans
flew
there
and
the
*NL*
water
and
the
shore
beneath
were
fouled
with
their
green-white
slime
.
*NL*
They
embraced
softly
,
impelled
by
the
grey
rainy
light
,
the
wet
*NL*
silent
trees
,
the
shield-like
witnessing
lake
,
the
swans
.
They
embraced
*NL*
without
joy
or
passion
,
his
arm
about
his
sister
's
neck
.
A
grey
woollen
*NL*
cloak
was
wrapped
athwart
her
from
her
shoulder
to
her
waist
and
her
*NL*
fair
head
was
bent
in
willing
shame
.
He
had
loose
red-brown
hair
and
*NL*
tender
shapely
strong
freckled
hands
.
Face
?
There
was
no
face
seen
.
The
*NL*
brother
's
face
was
bent
upon
her
fair
rain-fragrant
hair
.
The
hand
*NL*
freckled
and
strong
and
shapely
and
caressing
was
Davin
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
frowned
angrily
upon
his
thought
and
on
the
shrivelled
mannikin
who
*NL*
had
called
it
forth
.
His
father
's
jibes
at
the
Bantry
gang
leaped
out
*NL*
of
his
memory
.
He
held
them
at
a
distance
and
brooded
uneasily
on
his
*NL*
own
thought
again
.
Why
were
they
not
Cranly
's
hands
?
Had
Davin
's
*NL*
simplicity
and
innocence
stung
him
more
secretly
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
across
the
hall
with
Dixon
,
leaving
Cranly
to
take
leave
*NL*
elaborately
of
the
dwarf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
colonnade
Temple
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
little
group
*NL*
of
students
.
One
of
them
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dixon
,
come
over
till
you
hear
.
Temple
is
in
grand
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Temple
turned
on
him
his
dark
gipsy
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
're
a
hypocrite
,
O'Keeffe
,
he
said
.
And
Dixon
is
a
smiler
.
By
*NL*
hell
,
I
think
that
's
a
good
literary
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
slyly
,
looking
in
Stephen
's
face
,
repeating
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
By
hell
,
I
'm
delighted
with
that
name
.
A
smiler
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
stout
student
who
stood
below
them
on
the
steps
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
back
to
the
mistress
,
Temple
.
We
want
to
hear
about
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
had
,
faith
,
Temple
said
.
And
he
was
a
married
man
too
.
And
all
the
*NL*
priests
used
to
be
dining
there
.
By
hell
,
I
think
they
all
had
a
touch
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
shall
call
it
riding
a
hack
to
spare
the
hunter
,
said
Dixon
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
us
,
Temple
,
O'Keeffe
said
,
how
many
quarts
of
porter
have
you
*NL*
in
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
All
your
intellectual
soul
is
in
that
phrase
,
O'Keeffe
,
said
Temple
*NL*
with
open
scorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
with
a
shambling
gait
round
the
group
and
spoke
to
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
you
know
that
the
Forsters
are
the
kings
of
Belgium
?
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
came
out
through
the
door
of
the
entrance
hall
,
his
hat
thrust
*NL*
back
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
picking
his
teeth
with
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
here
's
the
wiseacre
,
said
Temple
.
Do
you
know
that
about
the
*NL*
Forsters
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
for
an
answer
.
Cranly
dislodged
a
figseed
from
his
teeth
on
*NL*
the
point
of
his
rude
toothpick
and
gazed
at
it
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
Forster
family
,
Temple
said
,
is
descended
from
Baldwin
the
*NL*
First
,
king
of
Flanders
.
He
was
called
the
Forester
.
Forester
and
*NL*
Forster
are
the
same
name
.
A
descendant
of
Baldwin
the
First
,
captain
*NL*
Francis
Forster
,
settled
in
Ireland
and
married
the
daughter
of
the
*NL*
last
chieftain
of
Clanbrassil
.
Then
there
are
the
Blake
Forsters
.
*NL*
That
's
a
different
branch
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
From
Baldhead
,
king
of
Flanders
,
Cranly
repeated
,
rooting
again
*NL*
deliberately
at
his
gleaming
uncovered
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
did
you
pick
up
all
that
history
?
O'Keeffe
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
all
the
history
of
your
family
,
too
,
Temple
said
,
turning
to
*NL*
Stephen
.
Do
you
know
what
Giraldus
Cambrensis
says
about
your
family
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
he
descended
from
Baldwin
too
?
asked
a
tall
consumptive
student
*NL*
with
dark
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Baldhead
,
Cranly
repeated
,
sucking
at
a
crevice
in
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
PERNOBILIS
ET
PERVETUSTA
FAMILIA
,
Temple
said
to
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stout
student
who
stood
below
them
on
the
steps
farted
briefly
.
Dixon
*NL*
turned
towards
him
,
saying
in
a
soft
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
an
angel
speak
?
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
turned
also
and
said
vehemently
but
without
anger
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Goggins
,
you
're
the
flamingest
dirty
devil
I
ever
met
,
do
you
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
had
it
on
my
mind
to
say
that
,
Goggins
answered
firmly
.
It
did
no
*NL*
one
any
harm
,
did
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
hope
,
Dixon
said
suavely
,
that
it
was
not
of
the
kind
known
to
*NL*
science
as
a
PAULO
POST
FUTURUM
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
n't
I
tell
you
he
was
a
smiler
?
said
Temple
,
turning
right
and
*NL*
left
.
Did
n't
I
give
him
that
name
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
did
.
We
're
not
deaf
,
said
the
tall
consumptive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
still
frowned
at
the
stout
student
below
him
.
Then
,
with
a
snort
*NL*
of
disgust
,
he
shoved
him
violently
down
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Go
away
from
here
,
he
said
rudely
.
Go
away
,
you
stinkpot
.
And
you
are
a
*NL*
stinkpot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Goggins
skipped
down
on
to
the
gravel
and
at
once
returned
to
his
place
*NL*
with
good
humour
.
Temple
turned
back
to
Stephen
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
believe
in
the
law
of
heredity
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
drunk
or
what
are
you
or
what
are
you
trying
to
say
?
asked
*NL*
Cranly
,
facing
round
on
him
with
an
expression
of
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
most
profound
sentence
ever
written
,
Temple
said
with
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
is
the
sentence
at
the
end
of
the
zoology
.
Reproduction
is
*NL*
the
beginning
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
touched
Stephen
timidly
at
the
elbow
and
said
eagerly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
feel
how
profound
that
is
because
you
are
a
poet
?
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
pointed
his
long
forefinger
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Look
at
him
!
he
said
with
scorn
to
the
others
.
Look
at
Ireland
's
hope
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
laughed
at
his
words
and
gesture
.
Temple
turned
on
him
bravely
,
*NL*
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Cranly
,
you
're
always
sneering
at
me
.
I
can
see
that
.
But
I
am
as
*NL*
good
as
you
any
day
.
Do
you
know
what
I
think
about
you
now
as
compared
*NL*
with
myself
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
dear
man
,
said
Cranly
urbanely
,
you
are
incapable
,
do
you
know
,
*NL*
absolutely
incapable
of
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
do
you
know
,
Temple
went
on
,
what
I
think
of
you
and
of
myself
*NL*
compared
together
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Out
with
it
,
Temple
!
the
stout
student
cried
from
the
steps
.
Get
it
*NL*
out
in
bits
!
*NL*
*NL*
Temple
turned
right
and
left
,
making
sudden
feeble
gestures
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
a
ballocks
,
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
in
despair
.
I
am
and
I
*NL*
know
I
am
.
And
I
admit
it
that
I
am
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dixon
patted
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
and
said
mildly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
it
does
you
every
credit
,
Temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
he
,
Temple
said
,
pointing
to
Cranly
,
he
is
a
ballocks
,
too
,
like
*NL*
me
.
Only
he
does
n't
know
it
.
And
that
's
the
only
difference
I
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
burst
of
laughter
covered
his
words
.
But
he
turned
again
to
Stephen
*NL*
and
said
with
a
sudden
eagerness
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
word
is
a
most
interesting
word
.
That
's
the
only
English
dual
*NL*
number
.
Did
you
know
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
it
?
Stephen
said
vaguely
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
watching
Cranly
's
firm-featured
suffering
face
,
lit
up
now
by
a
*NL*
smile
of
false
patience
.
The
gross
name
had
passed
over
it
like
foul
*NL*
water
poured
over
an
old
stone
image
,
patient
of
injuries
;
and
,
as
he
*NL*
watched
him
,
he
saw
him
raise
his
hat
in
salute
and
uncover
the
black
*NL*
hair
that
stood
stiffly
from
his
forehead
like
an
iron
crown
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
out
from
the
porch
of
the
library
and
bowed
across
Stephen
*NL*
in
reply
to
Cranly
's
greeting
.
He
also
?
Was
there
not
a
slight
flush
on
*NL*
Cranly
's
cheek
?
Or
had
it
come
forth
at
Temple
's
words
?
The
light
had
*NL*
waned
.
He
could
not
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
that
explain
his
friend
's
listless
silence
,
his
harsh
comments
,
the
*NL*
sudden
intrusions
of
rude
speech
with
which
he
had
shattered
so
often
*NL*
Stephen
's
ardent
wayward
confessions
?
Stephen
had
forgiven
freely
for
*NL*
he
had
found
this
rudeness
also
in
himself
.
And
he
remembered
an
*NL*
evening
when
he
had
dismounted
from
a
borrowed
creaking
bicycle
to
pray
*NL*
to
God
in
a
wood
near
Malahide
.
He
had
lifted
up
his
arms
and
spoken
in
*NL*
ecstasy
to
the
sombre
nave
of
the
trees
,
knowing
that
he
stood
on
holy
*NL*
ground
and
in
a
holy
hour
.
And
when
two
constabulary
men
had
come
into
*NL*
sight
round
a
bend
in
the
gloomy
road
he
had
broken
off
his
prayer
to
*NL*
whistle
loudly
an
air
from
the
last
pantomime
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
beat
the
frayed
end
of
his
ashplant
against
the
base
of
a
*NL*
pillar
.
Had
Cranly
not
heard
him
?
Yet
he
could
wait
.
The
talk
about
him
*NL*
ceased
for
a
moment
and
a
soft
hiss
fell
again
from
a
window
above
.
But
*NL*
no
other
sound
was
in
the
air
and
the
swallows
whose
flight
he
had
*NL*
followed
with
idle
eyes
were
sleeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
passed
through
the
dusk
.
And
therefore
the
air
was
silent
save
*NL*
for
one
soft
hiss
that
fell
.
And
therefore
the
tongues
about
him
had
*NL*
ceased
their
babble
.
Darkness
was
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darkness
falls
from
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
trembling
joy
,
lambent
as
a
faint
light
,
played
like
a
fairy
host
*NL*
around
him
.
But
why
?
Her
passage
through
the
darkening
air
or
the
verse
*NL*
with
its
black
vowels
and
its
opening
sound
,
rich
and
lutelike
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
away
slowly
towards
the
deeper
shadows
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
colonnade
,
beating
the
stone
softly
with
his
stick
to
hide
his
revery
*NL*
from
the
students
whom
he
had
left
:
and
allowed
his
mind
to
summon
back
*NL*
to
itself
the
age
of
Dowland
and
Byrd
and
Nash
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eyes
,
opening
from
the
darkness
of
desire
,
eyes
that
dimmed
the
*NL*
breaking
east
.
What
was
their
languid
grace
but
the
softness
of
*NL*
chambering
?
And
what
was
their
shimmer
but
the
shimmer
of
the
scum
that
*NL*
mantled
the
cesspool
of
the
court
of
a
slobbering
Stuart
.
And
he
tasted
*NL*
in
the
language
of
memory
ambered
wines
,
dying
fallings
of
sweet
airs
,
*NL*
the
proud
pavan
,
and
saw
with
the
eyes
of
memory
kind
gentlewomen
in
*NL*
Covent
Garden
wooing
from
their
balconies
with
sucking
mouths
and
the
*NL*
pox-fouled
wenches
of
the
taverns
and
young
wives
that
,
gaily
yielding
*NL*
to
their
ravishers
,
clipped
and
clipped
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
images
he
had
summoned
gave
him
no
pleasure
.
They
were
secret
and
*NL*
inflaming
but
her
image
was
not
entangled
by
them
.
That
was
not
the
way
*NL*
to
think
of
her
.
It
was
not
even
the
way
in
which
he
thought
of
her
.
*NL*
Could
his
mind
then
not
trust
itself
?
Old
phrases
,
sweet
only
with
a
*NL*
disinterred
sweetness
like
the
figseeds
Cranly
rooted
out
of
his
*NL*
gleaming
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
thought
nor
vision
though
he
knew
vaguely
that
her
figure
*NL*
was
passing
homeward
through
the
city
.
Vaguely
first
and
then
more
*NL*
sharply
he
smelt
her
body
.
A
conscious
unrest
seethed
in
his
blood
.
*NL*
Yes
,
it
was
her
body
he
smelt
,
a
wild
and
languid
smell
,
the
tepid
*NL*
limbs
over
which
his
music
had
flowed
desirously
and
the
secret
soft
*NL*
linen
upon
which
her
flesh
distilled
odour
and
a
dew
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
louse
crawled
over
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
,
putting
his
thumb
and
*NL*
forefinger
deftly
beneath
his
loose
collar
,
he
caught
it
.
He
rolled
its
*NL*
body
,
tender
yet
brittle
as
a
grain
of
rice
,
between
thumb
and
finger
*NL*
for
an
instant
before
he
let
it
fall
from
him
and
wondered
would
it
*NL*
live
or
die
.
There
came
to
his
mind
a
curious
phrase
from
CORNELIUS
A
*NL*
LAPIDE
which
said
that
the
lice
born
of
human
sweat
were
not
created
by
*NL*
God
with
the
other
animals
on
the
sixth
day
.
But
the
tickling
of
the
*NL*
skin
of
his
neck
made
his
mind
raw
and
red
.
The
life
of
his
body
,
ill
*NL*
clad
,
ill
fed
,
louse-eaten
,
made
him
close
his
eyelids
in
a
sudden
*NL*
spasm
of
despair
and
in
the
darkness
he
saw
the
brittle
bright
bodies
*NL*
of
lice
falling
from
the
air
and
turning
often
as
they
fell
.
Yes
,
and
*NL*
it
was
not
darkness
that
fell
from
the
air
.
It
was
brightness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brightness
falls
from
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
even
remembered
rightly
Nash
's
line
.
All
the
images
it
had
*NL*
awakened
were
false
.
His
mind
bred
vermin
.
His
thoughts
were
lice
born
*NL*
of
the
sweat
of
sloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
back
quickly
along
the
colonnade
towards
the
group
of
students
.
*NL*
Well
then
,
let
her
go
and
be
damned
to
her
!
She
could
love
some
clean
*NL*
athlete
who
washed
himself
every
morning
to
the
waist
and
had
black
*NL*
hair
on
his
chest
.
Let
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
had
taken
another
dried
fig
from
the
supply
in
his
pocket
and
*NL*
was
eating
it
slowly
and
noisily
.
Temple
sat
on
the
pediment
of
a
*NL*
pillar
,
leaning
back
,
his
cap
pulled
down
on
his
sleepy
eyes
.
A
squat
*NL*
young
man
came
out
of
the
porch
,
a
leather
portfolio
tucked
under
his
*NL*
armpit
.
He
marched
towards
the
group
,
striking
the
flags
with
the
heels
*NL*
of
his
boots
and
with
the
ferrule
of
his
heavy
umbrella
.
Then
,
raising
*NL*
the
umbrella
in
salute
,
he
said
to
all
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
evening
,
sirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
struck
the
flags
again
and
tittered
while
his
head
trembled
with
a
*NL*
slight
nervous
movement
.
The
tall
consumptive
student
and
Dixon
and
*NL*
O'Keeffe
were
speaking
in
Irish
and
did
not
answer
him
.
Then
,
turning
*NL*
to
Cranly
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
evening
,
particularly
to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
the
umbrella
in
indication
and
tittered
again
.
Cranly
,
who
was
*NL*
still
chewing
the
fig
,
answered
with
loud
movements
of
his
jaws
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
?
Yes
.
It
is
a
good
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squat
student
looked
at
him
seriously
and
shook
his
umbrella
gently
*NL*
and
reprovingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
can
see
,
he
said
,
that
you
are
about
to
make
obvious
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Um
,
Cranly
answered
,
holding
out
what
remained
of
the
half
chewed
*NL*
fig
and
jerking
it
towards
the
squat
student
's
mouth
in
sign
that
he
*NL*
should
eat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squat
student
did
not
eat
it
but
,
indulging
his
special
humour
,
*NL*
said
gravely
,
still
tittering
and
prodding
his
phrase
with
his
*NL*
umbrella
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
intend
that
...
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
off
,
pointed
bluntly
to
the
munched
pulp
of
the
fig
,
and
said
*NL*
loudly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
allude
to
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Um
,
Cranly
said
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
intend
that
now
,
the
squat
student
said
,
as
IPSO
FACTO
or
,
*NL*
let
us
say
,
as
so
to
speak
?
*NL*
*NL*
Dixon
turned
aside
from
his
group
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Goggins
was
waiting
for
you
,
Glynn
.
He
has
gone
round
to
the
Adelphi
*NL*
to
look
for
you
and
Moynihan
.
What
have
you
there
?
he
asked
,
tapping
*NL*
the
portfolio
under
Glynn
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Examination
papers
,
Glynn
answered
.
I
give
them
monthly
examinations
*NL*
to
see
that
they
are
profiting
by
my
tuition
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
also
tapped
the
portfolio
and
coughed
gently
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tuition
!
said
Cranly
rudely
.
I
suppose
you
mean
the
barefooted
*NL*
children
that
are
taught
by
a
bloody
ape
like
you
.
God
help
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
bit
off
the
rest
of
the
fig
and
flung
away
the
butt
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
,
Glynn
said
amiably
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
bloody
ape
,
Cranly
repeated
with
emphasis
,
and
a
blasphemous
*NL*
bloody
ape
!
*NL*
*NL*
Temple
stood
up
and
,
pushing
past
Cranly
,
addressed
Glynn
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
phrase
you
said
now
,
he
said
,
is
from
the
new
testament
about
*NL*
suffer
the
children
to
come
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Go
to
sleep
again
,
Temple
,
said
O'Keeffe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Very
well
,
then
,
Temple
continued
,
still
addressing
Glynn
,
and
if
*NL*
Jesus
suffered
the
children
to
come
why
does
the
church
send
them
all
*NL*
to
hell
if
they
die
unbaptized
?
Why
is
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Were
you
baptized
yourself
,
Temple
?
the
consumptive
student
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
why
are
they
sent
to
hell
if
Jesus
said
they
were
all
to
come
?
*NL*
Temple
said
,
his
eyes
searching
Glynn
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Glynn
coughed
and
said
gently
,
holding
back
with
difficulty
the
nervous
*NL*
titter
in
his
voice
and
moving
his
umbrella
at
every
word
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
,
as
you
remark
,
if
it
is
thus
,
I
ask
emphatically
whence
comes
*NL*
this
thusness
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Because
the
church
is
cruel
like
all
old
sinners
,
Temple
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
quite
orthodox
on
that
point
,
Temple
?
Dixon
said
suavely
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Saint
Augustine
says
that
about
unbaptized
children
going
to
hell
,
*NL*
Temple
answered
,
because
he
was
a
cruel
old
sinner
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
bow
to
you
,
Dixon
said
,
but
I
had
the
impression
that
limbo
*NL*
existed
for
such
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
n't
argue
with
him
,
Dixon
,
Cranly
said
brutally
.
Do
n't
talk
to
him
*NL*
or
look
at
him
.
Lead
him
home
with
a
sugan
the
way
you
'd
lead
a
*NL*
bleating
goat
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Limbo
!
Temple
cried
.
That
's
a
fine
invention
too
.
Like
hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
with
the
unpleasantness
left
out
,
Dixon
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
smiling
to
the
others
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
think
I
am
voicing
the
opinions
of
all
present
in
saying
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
are
,
Glynn
said
in
a
firm
tone
.
On
that
point
Ireland
is
united
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
struck
the
ferrule
of
his
umbrella
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
*NL*
colonnade
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hell
,
Temple
said
.
I
can
respect
that
invention
of
the
grey
spouse
*NL*
of
Satan
.
Hell
is
Roman
,
like
the
walls
of
the
Romans
,
strong
and
ugly
.
*NL*
But
what
is
limbo
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Put
him
back
into
the
perambulator
,
Cranly
,
O'Keeffe
called
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
made
a
swift
step
towards
Temple
,
halted
,
stamping
his
foot
,
*NL*
crying
as
if
to
a
fowl
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hoosh
!
*NL*
*NL*
Temple
moved
away
nimbly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
know
what
limbo
is
?
he
cried
.
Do
you
know
what
we
call
a
*NL*
notion
like
that
in
Roscommon
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hoosh
!
Blast
you
!
Cranly
cried
,
clapping
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Neither
my
arse
nor
my
elbow
!
Temple
cried
out
scornfully
.
And
*NL*
that
's
what
I
call
limbo
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Give
us
that
stick
here
,
Cranly
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
snatched
the
ashplant
roughly
from
Stephen
's
hand
and
sprang
down
*NL*
the
steps
:
but
Temple
,
hearing
him
move
in
pursuit
,
fled
through
the
*NL*
dusk
like
a
wild
creature
,
nimble
and
fleet-footed
.
Cranly
's
heavy
*NL*
boots
were
heard
loudly
charging
across
the
quadrangle
and
then
*NL*
returning
heavily
,
foiled
and
spurning
the
gravel
at
each
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
step
was
angry
and
with
an
angry
abrupt
gesture
he
thrust
the
stick
*NL*
back
into
Stephen
's
hand
.
Stephen
felt
that
his
anger
had
another
cause
*NL*
but
,
feigning
patience
,
touched
his
arm
slightly
and
said
quietly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Cranly
,
I
told
you
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
.
Come
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
looked
at
him
for
a
few
moments
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
now
,
Stephen
said
.
We
ca
n't
speak
here
.
Come
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
crossed
the
quadrangle
together
without
speaking
.
The
bird
call
*NL*
from
SIEGFRIED
whistled
softly
followed
them
from
the
steps
of
the
*NL*
porch
.
Cranly
turned
,
and
Dixon
,
who
had
whistled
,
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
are
you
fellows
off
to
?
What
about
that
game
,
Cranly
?
*NL*
*NL*
They
parleyed
in
shouts
across
the
still
air
about
a
game
of
billiards
*NL*
to
be
played
in
the
Adelphi
hotel
.
Stephen
walked
on
alone
and
out
into
*NL*
the
quiet
of
Kildare
Street
opposite
Maple
's
hotel
he
stood
to
wait
,
*NL*
patient
again
.
The
name
of
the
hotel
,
a
colourless
polished
wood
,
and
*NL*
its
colourless
front
stung
him
like
a
glance
of
polite
disdain
.
He
*NL*
stared
angrily
back
at
the
softly
lit
drawing-room
of
the
hotel
in
*NL*
which
he
imagined
the
sleek
lives
of
the
patricians
of
Ireland
housed
*NL*
in
calm
.
They
thought
of
army
commissions
and
land
agents
:
peasants
*NL*
greeted
them
along
the
roads
in
the
country
;
they
knew
the
names
of
*NL*
certain
French
dishes
and
gave
orders
to
jarvies
in
high-pitched
*NL*
provincial
voices
which
pierced
through
their
skin-tight
accents
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
could
he
hit
their
conscience
or
how
cast
his
shadow
over
the
*NL*
imaginations
of
their
daughters
,
before
their
squires
begat
upon
them
,
*NL*
that
they
might
breed
a
race
less
ignoble
than
their
own
?
And
under
the
*NL*
deepened
dusk
he
felt
the
thoughts
and
desires
of
the
race
to
which
he
*NL*
belonged
flitting
like
bats
across
the
dark
country
lanes
,
under
trees
*NL*
by
the
edges
of
streams
and
near
the
pool-mottled
bogs
.
A
woman
had
*NL*
waited
in
the
doorway
as
Davin
had
passed
by
at
night
and
,
offering
him
*NL*
a
cup
of
milk
,
had
all
but
wooed
him
to
her
bed
;
for
Davin
had
the
mild
*NL*
eyes
of
one
who
could
be
secret
.
But
him
no
woman
's
eyes
had
wooed
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
arm
was
taken
in
a
strong
grip
and
Cranly
's
voice
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
us
eke
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
southward
in
silence
.
Then
Cranly
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
blithering
idiot
,
Temple
!
I
swear
to
Moses
,
do
you
know
,
that
*NL*
I
'll
be
the
death
of
that
fellow
one
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
voice
was
no
longer
angry
and
Stephen
wondered
was
he
thinking
*NL*
of
her
greeting
to
him
under
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
to
the
left
and
walked
on
as
before
.
When
they
had
gone
on
*NL*
so
for
some
time
Stephen
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Cranly
,
I
had
an
unpleasant
quarrel
this
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
With
your
people
?
Cranly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
With
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
About
religion
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Stephen
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
Cranly
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
age
is
your
mother
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
old
,
Stephen
said
.
She
wishes
me
to
make
my
easter
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
will
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
will
not
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
not
?
Cranly
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
will
not
serve
,
answered
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
remark
was
made
before
,
Cranly
said
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
made
behind
now
,
said
Stephen
hotly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
pressed
Stephen
's
arm
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Go
easy
,
my
dear
man
.
You
're
an
excitable
bloody
man
,
do
you
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
nervously
as
he
spoke
and
,
looking
up
into
Stephen
's
face
*NL*
with
moved
and
friendly
eyes
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
know
that
you
are
an
excitable
man
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
daresay
I
am
,
said
Stephen
,
laughing
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
minds
,
lately
estranged
,
seemed
suddenly
to
have
been
drawn
*NL*
closer
,
one
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
believe
in
the
eucharist
?
Cranly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
not
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
disbelieve
then
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
neither
believe
in
it
nor
disbelieve
in
it
,
Stephen
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Many
persons
have
doubts
,
even
religious
persons
,
yet
they
overcome
*NL*
them
or
put
them
aside
,
Cranly
said
.
Are
your
doubts
on
that
point
too
*NL*
strong
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
not
wish
to
overcome
them
,
Stephen
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
,
embarrassed
for
a
moment
,
took
another
fig
from
his
pocket
and
*NL*
was
about
to
eat
it
when
Stephen
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
n't
,
please
.
You
can
not
discuss
this
question
with
your
mouth
full
*NL*
of
chewed
fig
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
examined
the
fig
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
under
which
he
halted
.
*NL*
Then
he
smelt
it
with
both
nostrils
,
bit
a
tiny
piece
,
spat
it
out
and
*NL*
threw
the
fig
rudely
into
the
gutter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Addressing
it
as
it
lay
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Depart
from
me
,
ye
cursed
,
into
everlasting
fire
!
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
Stephen
's
arm
,
he
went
on
again
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
not
fear
that
those
words
may
be
spoken
to
you
on
the
day
of
*NL*
Judgement
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
offered
me
on
the
other
hand
?
Stephen
asked
.
An
eternity
of
*NL*
bliss
in
the
company
of
the
dean
of
studies
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Remember
,
Cranly
said
,
that
he
would
be
glorified
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
Stephen
said
somewhat
bitterly
,
bright
,
agile
,
impassible
and
,
*NL*
above
all
,
subtle
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
a
curious
thing
,
do
you
know
,
Cranly
said
dispassionately
,
how
*NL*
your
mind
is
supersaturated
with
the
religion
in
which
you
say
you
*NL*
disbelieve
.
Did
you
believe
in
it
when
you
were
at
school
?
I
bet
you
*NL*
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
did
,
Stephen
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
were
you
happier
then
?
Cranly
asked
softly
,
happier
than
you
are
*NL*
now
,
for
instance
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Often
happy
,
Stephen
said
,
and
often
unhappy
.
I
was
someone
else
*NL*
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
someone
else
?
What
do
you
mean
by
that
statement
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
mean
,
said
Stephen
,
that
I
was
not
myself
as
I
am
now
,
as
I
had
to
*NL*
become
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
as
you
are
now
,
not
as
you
had
to
become
,
Cranly
repeated
.
Let
*NL*
me
ask
you
a
question
.
Do
you
love
your
mother
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
shook
his
head
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
n't
know
what
your
words
mean
,
he
said
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Have
you
never
loved
anyone
?
Cranly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
mean
women
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
not
speaking
of
that
,
Cranly
said
in
a
colder
tone
.
I
ask
you
*NL*
if
you
ever
felt
love
towards
anyone
or
anything
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
walked
on
beside
his
friend
,
staring
gloomily
at
the
footpath
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
tried
to
love
God
,
he
said
at
length
.
It
seems
now
I
failed
.
It
is
*NL*
very
difficult
.
I
tried
to
unite
my
will
with
the
will
of
God
instant
*NL*
by
instant
.
In
that
I
did
not
always
fail
.
I
could
perhaps
do
that
*NL*
still
--
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
cut
him
short
by
asking
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Has
your
mother
had
a
happy
life
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
do
I
know
?
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
many
children
had
she
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nine
or
ten
,
Stephen
answered
.
Some
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Was
your
father
...
Cranly
interrupted
himself
for
an
instant
,
and
then
*NL*
said
:
I
do
n't
want
to
pry
into
your
family
affairs
.
But
was
your
father
*NL*
what
is
called
well-to-do
?
I
mean
,
when
you
were
growing
up
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
was
he
?
Cranly
asked
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
began
to
enumerate
glibly
his
father
's
attributes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
medical
student
,
an
oarsman
,
a
tenor
,
an
amateur
actor
,
a
shouting
*NL*
politician
,
a
small
landlord
,
a
small
investor
,
a
drinker
,
a
good
*NL*
fellow
,
a
story-teller
,
somebody
's
secretary
,
something
in
a
*NL*
distillery
,
a
tax-gatherer
,
a
bankrupt
and
at
present
a
praiser
of
his
*NL*
own
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
laughed
,
tightening
his
grip
on
Stephen
's
arm
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
distillery
is
damn
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
know
?
Stephen
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
in
good
circumstances
at
present
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
I
look
it
?
Stephen
asked
bluntly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
So
then
,
Cranly
went
on
musingly
,
you
were
born
in
the
lap
of
luxury
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
used
the
phrase
broadly
and
loudly
as
he
often
used
technical
*NL*
expressions
,
as
if
he
wished
his
hearer
to
understand
that
they
were
*NL*
used
by
him
without
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Your
mother
must
have
gone
through
a
good
deal
of
suffering
,
he
said
*NL*
then
.
Would
you
not
try
to
save
her
from
suffering
more
even
if
...
or
would
*NL*
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
I
could
,
Stephen
said
,
that
would
cost
me
very
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
do
so
,
Cranly
said
.
Do
as
she
wishes
you
to
do
.
What
is
it
for
*NL*
you
?
You
disbelieve
in
it
.
It
is
a
form
:
nothing
else
.
And
you
will
set
*NL*
her
mind
at
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ceased
and
,
as
Stephen
did
not
reply
,
remained
silent
.
Then
,
as
if
*NL*
giving
utterance
to
the
process
of
his
own
thought
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Whatever
else
is
unsure
in
this
stinking
dunghill
of
a
world
a
*NL*
mother
's
love
is
not
.
Your
mother
brings
you
into
the
world
,
carries
*NL*
you
first
in
her
body
.
What
do
we
know
about
what
she
feels
?
But
*NL*
whatever
she
feels
,
it
,
at
least
,
must
be
real
.
It
must
be
.
What
are
*NL*
our
ideas
or
ambitions
?
Play
.
Ideas
!
Why
,
that
bloody
bleating
goat
*NL*
Temple
has
ideas
.
MacCann
has
ideas
too
.
Every
jackass
going
the
roads
*NL*
thinks
he
has
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
who
had
been
listening
to
the
unspoken
speech
behind
the
*NL*
words
,
said
with
assumed
carelessness
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pascal
,
if
I
remember
rightly
,
would
not
suffer
his
mother
to
kiss
*NL*
him
as
he
feared
the
contact
of
her
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pascal
was
a
pig
,
said
Cranly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Aloysius
Gonzaga
,
I
think
,
was
of
the
same
mind
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
he
was
another
pig
then
,
said
Cranly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
church
calls
him
a
saint
,
Stephen
objected
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
n't
care
a
flaming
damn
what
anyone
calls
him
,
Cranly
said
rudely
*NL*
and
flatly
.
I
call
him
a
pig
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
preparing
the
words
neatly
in
his
mind
,
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Jesus
,
too
,
seems
to
have
treated
his
mother
with
scant
courtesy
in
*NL*
public
but
Suarez
,
a
jesuit
theologian
and
Spanish
gentleman
,
has
*NL*
apologized
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
the
idea
ever
occur
to
you
,
Cranly
asked
,
that
Jesus
was
not
*NL*
what
he
pretended
to
be
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
first
person
to
whom
that
idea
occurred
,
Stephen
answered
,
was
*NL*
Jesus
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
mean
,
Cranly
said
,
hardening
in
his
speech
,
did
the
idea
ever
*NL*
occur
to
you
that
he
was
himself
a
conscious
hypocrite
,
what
he
called
*NL*
the
jews
of
his
time
,
a
whited
sepulchre
?
Or
,
to
put
it
more
plainly
,
*NL*
that
he
was
a
blackguard
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
idea
never
occurred
to
me
,
Stephen
answered
.
But
I
am
curious
*NL*
to
know
are
you
trying
to
make
a
convert
of
me
or
a
pervert
of
*NL*
yourself
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
towards
his
friend
's
face
and
saw
there
a
raw
smile
which
*NL*
some
force
of
will
strove
to
make
finely
significant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
asked
suddenly
in
a
plain
sensible
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
me
the
truth
.
Were
you
at
all
shocked
by
what
I
said
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Somewhat
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
why
were
you
shocked
,
Cranly
pressed
on
in
the
same
tone
,
if
you
*NL*
feel
sure
that
our
religion
is
false
and
that
Jesus
was
not
the
son
of
*NL*
God
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
not
at
all
sure
of
it
,
Stephen
said
.
He
is
more
like
a
son
of
*NL*
God
than
a
son
of
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
is
that
why
you
will
not
communicate
,
Cranly
asked
,
because
you
*NL*
are
not
sure
of
that
too
,
because
you
feel
that
the
host
,
too
,
may
be
*NL*
the
body
and
blood
of
the
son
of
God
and
not
a
wafer
of
bread
?
And
*NL*
because
you
fear
that
it
may
be
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Stephen
said
quietly
,
I
feel
that
and
I
also
fear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
see
,
Cranly
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
struck
by
his
tone
of
closure
,
reopened
the
discussion
at
once
*NL*
by
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
fear
many
things
:
dogs
,
horses
,
fire-arms
,
the
sea
,
*NL*
thunder-storms
,
machinery
,
the
country
roads
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
why
do
you
fear
a
bit
of
bread
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
imagine
,
Stephen
said
,
that
there
is
a
malevolent
reality
behind
*NL*
those
things
I
say
I
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
fear
then
,
Cranly
asked
,
that
the
God
of
the
Roman
catholics
*NL*
would
strike
you
dead
and
damn
you
if
you
made
a
sacrilegious
*NL*
communion
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
God
of
the
Roman
catholics
could
do
that
now
,
Stephen
said
.
I
fear
*NL*
more
than
that
the
chemical
action
which
would
be
set
up
in
my
soul
by
*NL*
a
false
homage
to
a
symbol
behind
which
are
massed
twenty
centuries
of
*NL*
authority
and
veneration
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Would
you
,
Cranly
asked
,
in
extreme
danger
,
commit
that
particular
*NL*
sacrilege
?
For
instance
,
if
you
lived
in
the
penal
days
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
can
not
answer
for
the
past
,
Stephen
replied
.
Possibly
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
,
said
Cranly
,
you
do
not
intend
to
become
a
protestant
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
said
that
I
had
lost
the
faith
,
Stephen
answered
,
but
not
that
I
*NL*
had
lost
self-respect
.
What
kind
of
liberation
would
that
be
to
forsake
*NL*
an
absurdity
which
is
logical
and
coherent
and
to
embrace
one
which
is
*NL*
illogical
and
incoherent
?
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
walked
on
towards
the
township
of
Pembroke
and
now
,
as
they
*NL*
went
on
slowly
along
the
avenues
,
the
trees
and
the
scattered
lights
in
*NL*
the
villas
soothed
their
minds
.
The
air
of
wealth
and
repose
diffused
*NL*
about
them
seemed
to
comfort
their
neediness
.
Behind
a
hedge
of
laurel
*NL*
a
light
glimmered
in
the
window
of
a
kitchen
and
the
voice
of
a
servant
*NL*
was
heard
singing
as
she
sharpened
knives
.
She
sang
,
in
short
broken
*NL*
bars
:
*NL*
*NL*
Rosie
O'Grady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
stopped
to
listen
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
MULIER
CANTAT
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soft
beauty
of
the
Latin
word
touched
with
an
enchanting
touch
the
*NL*
dark
of
the
evening
,
with
a
touch
fainter
and
more
persuading
than
the
*NL*
touch
of
music
or
of
a
woman
's
hand
.
The
strife
of
their
minds
was
*NL*
quelled
.
The
figure
of
a
woman
as
she
appears
in
the
liturgy
of
the
*NL*
church
passed
silently
through
the
darkness
:
a
white-robed
figure
,
*NL*
small
and
slender
as
a
boy
,
and
with
a
falling
girdle
.
Her
voice
,
frail
*NL*
and
high
as
a
boy
's
,
was
heard
intoning
from
a
distant
choir
the
first
*NL*
words
of
a
woman
which
pierce
the
gloom
and
clamour
of
the
first
*NL*
chanting
of
the
passion
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
ET
TU
CUM
JESU
GALILAEO
ERAS
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
hearts
were
touched
and
turned
to
her
voice
,
shining
like
a
*NL*
young
star
,
shining
clearer
as
the
voice
intoned
the
proparoxytone
and
*NL*
more
faintly
as
the
cadence
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
singing
ceased
.
They
went
on
together
,
Cranly
repeating
in
strongly
*NL*
stressed
rhythm
the
end
of
the
refrain
:
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
we
are
married
,
*NL*
O
,
how
happy
we
'll
be
*NL*
For
I
love
sweet
Rosie
O'Grady
*NL*
And
Rosie
O'Grady
loves
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
's
real
poetry
for
you
,
he
said
.
There
's
real
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
sideways
at
Stephen
with
a
strange
smile
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
consider
that
poetry
?
Or
do
you
know
what
the
words
mean
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
want
to
see
Rosie
first
,
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
She
's
easy
to
find
,
Cranly
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hat
had
come
down
on
his
forehead
.
He
shoved
it
back
and
in
the
*NL*
shadow
of
the
trees
Stephen
saw
his
pale
face
,
framed
by
the
dark
,
and
*NL*
his
large
dark
eyes
.
Yes
.
His
face
was
handsome
and
his
body
was
strong
*NL*
and
hard
.
He
had
spoken
of
a
mother
's
love
.
He
felt
then
the
sufferings
*NL*
of
women
,
the
weaknesses
of
their
bodies
and
souls
:
and
would
shield
*NL*
them
with
a
strong
and
resolute
arm
and
bow
his
mind
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Away
then
:
it
is
time
to
go
.
A
voice
spoke
softly
to
Stephen
's
lonely
*NL*
heart
,
bidding
him
go
and
telling
him
that
his
friendship
was
coming
to
*NL*
an
end
.
Yes
;
he
would
go
.
He
could
not
strive
against
another
.
He
knew
*NL*
his
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Probably
I
shall
go
away
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
?
Cranly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
I
can
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Cranly
said
.
It
might
be
difficult
for
you
to
live
here
now
.
*NL*
But
is
it
that
makes
you
go
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
to
go
,
Stephen
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Because
,
Cranly
continued
,
you
need
not
look
upon
yourself
as
driven
*NL*
away
if
you
do
not
wish
to
go
or
as
a
heretic
or
an
outlaw
.
There
are
*NL*
many
good
believers
who
think
as
you
do
.
Would
that
surprise
you
?
The
*NL*
church
is
not
the
stone
building
nor
even
the
clergy
and
their
dogmas
.
*NL*
It
is
the
whole
mass
of
those
born
into
it
.
I
do
n't
know
what
you
wish
*NL*
to
do
in
life
.
Is
it
what
you
told
me
the
night
we
were
standing
*NL*
outside
Harcourt
Street
station
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Stephen
said
,
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
at
Cranly
's
way
of
*NL*
remembering
thoughts
in
connexion
with
places
.
The
night
you
spent
half
*NL*
an
hour
wrangling
with
Doherty
about
the
shortest
way
from
Sallygap
to
*NL*
Larras
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pothead
!
Cranly
said
with
calm
contempt
.
What
does
he
know
about
the
*NL*
way
from
Sallygap
to
Larras
?
Or
what
does
he
know
about
anything
for
*NL*
that
matter
?
And
the
big
slobbering
washing-pot
head
of
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
into
a
loud
long
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
?
Stephen
said
.
Do
you
remember
the
rest
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
you
said
,
is
it
?
Cranly
asked
.
Yes
,
I
remember
it
.
To
discover
the
*NL*
mode
of
life
or
of
art
whereby
your
spirit
could
express
itself
in
*NL*
unfettered
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
raised
his
hat
in
acknowledgement
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Freedom
!
Cranly
repeated
.
But
you
are
not
free
enough
yet
to
commit
*NL*
a
sacrilege
.
Tell
me
would
you
rob
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
would
beg
first
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
if
you
got
nothing
,
would
you
rob
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
wish
me
to
say
,
Stephen
answered
,
that
the
rights
of
property
*NL*
are
provisional
,
and
that
in
certain
circumstances
it
is
not
unlawful
*NL*
to
rob
.
Everyone
would
act
in
that
belief
.
So
I
will
not
make
you
that
*NL*
answer
.
Apply
to
the
jesuit
theologian
,
Juan
Mariana
de
Talavera
,
who
*NL*
will
also
explain
to
you
in
what
circumstances
you
may
lawfully
kill
*NL*
your
king
and
whether
you
had
better
hand
him
his
poison
in
a
goblet
or
*NL*
smear
it
for
him
upon
his
robe
or
his
saddlebow
.
Ask
me
rather
would
I
*NL*
suffer
others
to
rob
me
,
or
if
they
did
,
would
I
call
down
upon
them
*NL*
what
I
believe
is
called
the
chastisement
of
the
secular
arm
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
would
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
think
,
Stephen
said
,
it
would
pain
me
as
much
to
do
so
as
to
be
*NL*
robbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
see
,
Cranly
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
produced
his
match
and
began
to
clean
the
crevice
between
two
teeth
.
*NL*
Then
he
said
carelessly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
me
,
for
example
,
would
you
deflower
a
virgin
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Excuse
me
,
Stephen
said
politely
,
is
that
not
the
ambition
of
most
*NL*
young
gentlemen
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
then
is
your
point
of
view
?
Cranly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
last
phrase
,
sour
smelling
as
the
smoke
of
charcoal
and
*NL*
disheartening
,
excited
Stephen
's
brain
,
over
which
its
fumes
seemed
to
*NL*
brood
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Look
here
,
Cranly
,
he
said
.
You
have
asked
me
what
I
would
do
and
*NL*
what
I
would
not
do
.
I
will
tell
you
what
I
will
do
and
what
I
will
not
*NL*
do
.
I
will
not
serve
that
in
which
I
no
longer
believe
,
whether
it
call
*NL*
itself
my
home
,
my
fatherland
,
or
my
church
:
and
I
will
try
to
express
*NL*
myself
in
some
mode
of
life
or
art
as
freely
as
I
can
and
as
wholly
as
*NL*
I
can
,
using
for
my
defence
the
only
arms
I
allow
myself
to
use
--
silence
,
*NL*
exile
,
and
cunning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
seized
his
arm
and
steered
him
round
so
as
to
lead
him
back
*NL*
towards
Leeson
Park
.
He
laughed
almost
slyly
and
pressed
Stephen
's
arm
*NL*
with
an
elder
's
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Cunning
indeed
!
he
said
.
Is
it
you
?
You
poor
poet
,
you
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
you
made
me
confess
to
you
,
Stephen
said
,
thrilled
by
his
touch
,
*NL*
as
I
have
confessed
to
you
so
many
other
things
,
have
I
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
my
child
,
Cranly
said
,
still
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
made
me
confess
the
fears
that
I
have
.
But
I
will
tell
you
also
*NL*
what
I
do
not
fear
.
I
do
not
fear
to
be
alone
or
to
be
spurned
for
*NL*
another
or
to
leave
whatever
I
have
to
leave
.
And
I
am
not
afraid
to
*NL*
make
a
mistake
,
even
a
great
mistake
,
a
lifelong
mistake
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
as
long
as
eternity
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
,
now
grave
again
,
slowed
his
pace
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Alone
,
quite
alone
.
You
have
no
fear
of
that
.
And
you
know
what
that
*NL*
word
means
?
Not
only
to
be
separate
from
all
others
but
to
have
not
*NL*
even
one
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
will
take
the
risk
,
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
not
to
have
any
one
person
,
Cranly
said
,
who
would
be
more
than
*NL*
a
friend
,
more
even
than
the
noblest
and
truest
friend
a
man
ever
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
words
seemed
to
have
struck
some
deep
chord
in
his
own
nature
.
Had
*NL*
he
spoken
of
himself
,
of
himself
as
he
was
or
wished
to
be
?
Stephen
*NL*
watched
his
face
for
some
moments
in
silence
.
A
cold
sadness
was
there
.
*NL*
He
had
spoken
of
himself
,
of
his
own
loneliness
which
he
feared
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
whom
are
you
speaking
?
Stephen
asked
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
did
not
answer
.

*NL*
MARCH
20
.
Long
talk
with
Cranly
on
the
subject
of
my
revolt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
his
grand
manner
on
.
I
supple
and
suave
.
Attacked
me
on
the
*NL*
score
of
love
for
one
's
mother
.
Tried
to
imagine
his
mother
:
can
not
.
*NL*
Told
me
once
,
in
a
moment
of
thoughtlessness
,
his
father
was
sixty-one
*NL*
when
he
was
born
.
Can
see
him
.
Strong
farmer
type
.
Pepper
and
salt
*NL*
suit
.
Square
feet
.
Unkempt
,
grizzled
beard
.
Probably
attends
coursing
*NL*
matches
.
Pays
his
dues
regularly
but
not
plentifully
to
Father
Dwyer
of
*NL*
Larras
.
Sometimes
talks
to
girls
after
nightfall
.
But
his
mother
?
Very
*NL*
young
or
very
old
?
Hardly
the
first
.
If
so
,
Cranly
would
not
have
*NL*
spoken
as
he
did
.
Old
then
.
Probably
,
and
neglected
.
Hence
Cranly
's
*NL*
despair
of
soul
:
the
child
of
exhausted
loins
.
*NL*
*NL*
MARCH
21
,
MORNING
.
Thought
this
in
bed
last
night
but
was
too
lazy
and
*NL*
free
to
add
to
it
.
Free
,
yes
.
The
exhausted
loins
are
those
of
*NL*
Elizabeth
and
Zacchary
.
Then
he
is
the
precursor
.
Item
:
he
eats
chiefly
*NL*
belly
bacon
and
dried
figs
.
Read
locusts
and
wild
honey
.
Also
,
when
*NL*
thinking
of
him
,
saw
always
a
stern
severed
head
or
death
mask
as
if
*NL*
outlined
on
a
grey
curtain
or
veronica
.
Decollation
they
call
it
in
the
*NL*
gold
.
Puzzled
for
the
moment
by
saint
John
at
the
Latin
gate
.
What
do
I
*NL*
see
?
A
decollated
percursor
trying
to
pick
the
lock
.

Free

Soul
free
and

free

Let

bury

let
the
dead
marry

In

with
Lynch

Have
not
seen
her
since
that
night

Unwell
?
Sits
at
the
fire
*NL*
perhaps
with
mamma
's
shawl
on
her
shoulders
.
But
not
peevish
.
A
nice
*NL*
bowl
of
gruel
?
Wo
n't
you

*NL*
*NL*
MARCH
24
.
Began
with
a
discussion
with
my
mother
.
Subject
:
B.V.M.
*NL*
Handicapped
by
my
sex
and
youth
.
To
escape
held
up
relations
between
*NL*
Jesus
and
Papa
against
those
between
Mary
and
her
son
.
Said
religion
*NL*
was
not
a
lying-in
hospital
.
Mother
indulgent
.
Said
I
have
a
queer
mind
*NL*
and
have
read
too
much
.
Not
true
.
Have
read
little
and
understood
less
.
*NL*
Then
she
said
I
would
come
back
to
faith
because
I
had
a
restless
mind
.
*NL*
This
means
to
leave
church
by
back
door
of
sin
and
re-enter
through
the
*NL*
skylight
of
repentance
.
Can
not
repent
.
Told
her
so
and
asked
for
*NL*
sixpence
.
Got
threepence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
went
to
college
.
Other
wrangle
with
little
round
head
rogue
's
eye
*NL*
Ghezzi
.
This
time
about
Bruno
the
Nolan
.
Began
in
Italian
and
ended
in
*NL*
pidgin
English
.
He
said
Bruno
was
a
terrible
heretic
.
I
said
he
was
*NL*
terribly
burned
.
He
agreed
to
this
with
some
sorrow
.
Then
gave
me
*NL*
recipe
for
what
he
calls
RISOTTO
ALLA
BERGAMASCA
.
When
he
pronounces
a
*NL*
soft
O
he
protrudes
his
full
carnal
lips
as
if
he
kissed
the
vowel
.
Has
*NL*
he
?
And
could
he
repent
?
Yes
,
he
could
:
and
cry
two
round
rogue
's
*NL*
tears
,
one
from
each
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Crossing
Stephen
's
,
that
is
,
my
green
,
remembered
that
his
countrymen
*NL*
and
not
mine
had
invented
what
Cranly
the
other
night
called
our
*NL*
religion
.
A
quartet
of
them
,
soldiers
of
the
ninety-seventh
infantry
*NL*
regiment
,
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
and
tossed
up
dice
for
the
*NL*
overcoat
of
the
crucified
.
*NL*
*NL*
Went
to
library
.
Tried
to
read
three
reviews

Useless

She
is
not

Am
I
alarmed

About
what

That

A

gallery

From

ascend
pillars
of
dark
vapours

*NL*
It
is
peopled
by
the
images
of
fabulous
kings
,
set
in
stone

Their
*NL*
hands
are
folded
upon
their
knees
in
token
of
weariness
and
their
eyes

are
darkened
for
the
errors

go
up
before
them
for

dark

vapours

Strange
figures
advance

They

One
does
not
seem
to
stand
quite

Their
faces
are

phosphorescent

with

They
peer
at

seem
to
ask
me
something

They

This
evening
Cranly
was
in
the
porch
of

,
*NL*
proposing
a
problem
to
Dixon
and
her
brother
.
A
mother
let
her
child
*NL*
fall
into
the
Nile
.
Still
harping
on
the
mother
.
A
crocodile
seized
the
*NL*
child
.
Mother
asked
it
back
.
Crocodile
said
all
right
if
she
told
him
*NL*
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
the
child
,
eat
it
or
not
eat
it

at
the
cigar
shop
opposite
Findlater
's
church
.
He
*NL*
was
in
a
black
sweater
and
had
a
hurley
stick
.
Asked
me
was
it
true
I
*NL*
was
going
away
and
why
.
Told
him
the
shortest
way
to
Tara
was
VIA
*NL*
Holyhead
.
Just
then
my
father
came
up
.
Introduction
.
Father
polite
and
*NL*
observant
.
Asked
Davin
if
he
might
offer
him
some
refreshment
.
Davin
*NL*
could
not
,
was
going
to
a
meeting
.
When
we
came
away
father
told
me
he
*NL*
had
a
good
honest
eye
.
Asked
me
why
I
did
not
join
a
rowing
club
.
I
*NL*
pretended
to
think
it
over
.
Told
me
then
how
he
broke
Pennyfeather
's
*NL*
heart
.
Wants
me
to
read
law
.
Says
I
was
cut
out
for
that
.
More
mud
,
*NL*
more
crocodiles
.

Wild

Scudding

O
life
!
Dark
stream
of
swirling
*NL*
bogwater
on
which
apple-trees
have
cast
down
their
delicate
flowers
.
*NL*
Eyes
of
girls
among
the
leaves
.
Girls
demure
and
romping
.
All
fair
or
*NL*
auburn
:
no
dark
ones
.
They
blush
better
.
Houpla

Certainly
she
remembers
the
past
.
Lynch
says
all
women
do
.
*NL*
Then
she
remembers
the
time
of
her
childhood
--
and
mine
,
if
I
was
ever
*NL*
a
child
.
The
past
is
consumed
in
the
present
and
the
present
is
living
*NL*
only
because
it
brings
forth
the
future
.
Statues
of
women
,
if
Lynch
be
*NL*
right
,
should
always
be
fully
draped
,
one
hand
of
the
woman
feeling
*NL*
regretfully
her
own
hinder
parts
.

LATER
.
Michael
Robartes
remembers
forgotten
beauty
and
,
when
*NL*
his
arms
wrap
her
round
,
he
presses
in
his
arms
the
loveliness
which
*NL*
has
long
faded
from
the
world
.
Not
this
.
Not
at
all
.
I
desire
to
press
*NL*
in
my
arms
the
loveliness
which
has
not
yet
come
into
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
APRIL
10
.
Faintly
,
under
the
heavy
night
,
through
the
silence
of
the
*NL*
city
which
has
turned
from
dreams
to
dreamless
sleep
as
a
weary
lover
*NL*
whom
no
caresses
move
,
the
sound
of
hoofs
upon
the
road
.
Not
so
faintly
*NL*
now
as
they
come
near
the
bridge
;
and
in
a
moment
,
as
they
pass
the
*NL*
darkened
windows
,
the
silence
is
cloven
by
alarm
as
by
an
arrow
.
They
*NL*
are
heard
now
far
away
,
hoofs
that
shine
amid
the
heavy
night
as
gems
,
*NL*
hurrying
beyond
the
sleeping
fields
to
what
journey
's
end
--
what
*NL*
heart
?
--
bearing
what
tidings
?
*NL*
*NL*
APRIL
11
.
Read
what
I
wrote
last
night
.
Vague
words
for
a
vague
*NL*
emotion
.
Would
she
like
it
?
I
think
so
.
Then
I
should
have
to
like
it
*NL*
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
APRIL
13
.
That
tundish
has
been
on
my
mind
for
a
long
time
.
I
looked
it
*NL*
up
and
find
it
English
and
good
old
blunt
English
too
.
Damn
the
dean
of
*NL*
studies
and
his
funnel
!
What
did
he
come
here
for
to
teach
us
his
own
*NL*
language
or
to
learn
it
from
us
.
Damn
him
one
way
or
the
other
!

John
Alphonsus
Mulrennan
has
just
returned
from
the
west
of
*NL*
Ireland
.
European
and
Asiatic
papers
please
copy
.
He
told
us
he
met
an
*NL*
old
man
there
in
a
mountain
cabin
.
Old
man
had
red
eyes
and
short
pipe
.
*NL*
Old
man
spoke
Irish
.
Mulrennan
spoke
Irish
.
Then
old
man
and
Mulrennan
*NL*
spoke
English
.
Mulrennan
spoke
to
him
about
universe
and
stars
.
Old
man
*NL*
sat
,
listened
,
smoked
,
spat
.
Then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
,
there
must
be
terrible
queer
creatures
at
the
latter
end
of
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
fear
him
.
I
fear
his
red-rimmed
horny
eyes
.
It
is
with
him
I
must
*NL*
struggle
all
through
this
night
till
day
come
,
till
he
or
I
lie
dead
,
*NL*
gripping
him
by
the
sinewy
throat
till
...
Till
what
?
Till
he
yield
to
me
?
*NL*
No
.
I
mean
no
harm
.

APRIL

.
Met
her
today
point
blank
in
Grafton
Street
.
The
crowd
*NL*
brought
us
together
.
We
both
stopped
.
She
asked
me
why
I
never
came
,
*NL*
said
she
had
heard
all
sorts
of
stories
about
me
.
This
was
only
to
gain
*NL*
time
.
Asked
me
was
I
writing
poems
?
About
whom
?
I
asked
her
.
This
*NL*
confused
her
more
and
I
felt
sorry
and
mean
.
Turned
off
that
valve
at
*NL*
once
and
opened
the
spiritual-heroic
refrigerating
apparatus
,
invented
*NL*
and
patented
in
all
countries
by
Dante
Alighieri
.
Talked
rapidly
of
*NL*
myself
and
my
plans
.
In
the
midst
of
it
unluckily
I
made
a
sudden
*NL*
gesture
of
a
revolutionary
nature
.
I
must
have
looked
like
a
fellow
*NL*
throwing
a
handful
of
peas
into
the
air
.
People
began
to
look
at
us
.
*NL*
She
shook
hands
a
moment
after
and
,
in
going
away
,
said
she
hoped
I
*NL*
would
do
what
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
call
that
friendly
,
do
n't
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
I
liked
her
today
.
A
little
or
much
?
Do
n't
know
.
I
liked
her
and
*NL*
it
seems
a
new
feeling
to
me
.
Then
,
in
that
case
,
all
the
rest
,
all
*NL*
that
I
thought
I
thought
and
all
that
I
felt
I
felt
,
all
the
rest
*NL*
before
now
,
in
fact
...
O
,
give
it
up
,
old
chap
!
Sleep
it
off
!

Away

Away

*NL*
*NL*
The
spell
of
arms
and
voices
:
the
white
arms
of
roads
,
their
promise
of
*NL*
close
embraces
and
the
black
arms
of
tall
ships
that
stand
against
the
*NL*
moon
,
their
tale
of
distant
nations
.
They
are
held
out
to
say
:
We
are
*NL*
alone
--
come
.
And
the
voices
say
with
them
:
We
are
your
kinsmen
.
And
*NL*
the
air
is
thick
with
their
company
as
they
call
to
me
,
their
kinsman
,
*NL*
making
ready
to
go
,
shaking
the
wings
of
their
exultant
and
terrible
*NL*
youth

Mother
is
putting
my
new
secondhand
clothes
in
order
.
She
*NL*
prays
now
,
she
says
,
that
I
may
learn
in
my
own
life
and
away
from
home
*NL*
and
friends
what
the
heart
is
and
what
it
feels
.
Amen
.
So
be
it
.
*NL*
Welcome
,
O
life
,
I
go
to
encounter
for
the
millionth
time
the
reality
*NL*
of
experience
and
to
forge
in
the
smithy
of
my
soul
the
uncreated
*NL*
conscience
of
my
race
