THE
PORTRAIT
OF

PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Portrait
of
a
Lady
''
was
,
like
``
Roderick
Hudson
,
''
begun
in
Florence
,
*NL*
during
three
months
spent
there
in
the
spring
of
1879
.
Like
``
Roderick
''
*NL*
and
like
``
The
American
,
''
it
had
been
designed
for
publication
in
``
The
*NL*
Atlantic
Monthly
,
''
where
it
began
to
appear
in
1880
.
It
differed
from
*NL*
its
two
predecessors
,
however
,
in
finding
a
course
also
open
to
it
,
from
*NL*
month
to
month
,
in
``
Macmillan
's
Magazine
''
;
which
was
to
be
for
me
one
of
*NL*
the
last
occasions
of
simultaneous
``
serialisation
''
in
the
two
countries
*NL*
that
the
changing
conditions
of
literary
intercourse
between
England
and
*NL*
the
United
States
had
up
to
then
left
unaltered
.
It
is
a
long
novel
,
and
*NL*
I
was
long
in
writing
it
;
I
remember
being
again
much
occupied
with
it
,
*NL*
the
following
year
,
during
a
stay
of
several
weeks
made
in
Venice
.
I
had
*NL*
rooms
on
Riva
Schiavoni
,
at
the
top
of
a
house
near
the
passage
leading
*NL*
off
to
San
Zaccaria
;
the
waterside
life
,
the
wondrous
lagoon
spread
*NL*
before
me
,
and
the
ceaseless
human
chatter
of
Venice
came
in
at
my
*NL*
windows
,
to
which
I
seem
to
myself
to
have
been
constantly
driven
,
in
*NL*
the
fruitless
fidget
of
composition
,
as
if
to
see
whether
,
out
in
the
*NL*
blue
channel
,
the
ship
of
some
right
suggestion
,
of
some
better
phrase
,
*NL*
of
the
next
happy
twist
of
my
subject
,
the
next
true
touch
for
my
*NL*
canvas
,
might
n't
come
into
sight
.
But
I
recall
vividly
enough
that
the
*NL*
response
most
elicited
,
in
general
,
to
these
restless
appeals
was
the
*NL*
rather
grim
admonition
that
romantic
and
historic
sites
,
such
as
*NL*
the
land
of
Italy
abounds
in
,
offer
the
artist
a
questionable
aid
to
*NL*
concentration
when
they
themselves
are
not
to
be
the
subject
of
it
.
They
*NL*
are
too
rich
in
their
own
life
and
too
charged
with
their
own
meanings
*NL*
merely
to
help
him
out
with
a
lame
phrase
;
they
draw
him
away
from
his
*NL*
small
question
to
their
own
greater
ones
;
so
that
,
after
a
little
,
he
*NL*
feels
,
while
thus
yearning
toward
them
in
his
difficulty
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
asking
an
army
of
glorious
veterans
to
help
him
to
arrest
a
peddler
who
*NL*
has
given
him
the
wrong
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
pages
of
the
book
which
,
in
the
reading
over
,
have
seemed
*NL*
to
make
me
see
again
the
bristling
curve
of
the
wide
Riva
,
the
large
*NL*
colour-spots
of
the
balconied
houses
and
the
repeated
undulation
of
the
*NL*
little
hunchbacked
bridges
,
marked
by
the
rise
and
drop
again
,
with
the
*NL*
wave
,
of
foreshortened
clicking
pedestrians
.
The
Venetian
footfall
and
*NL*
the
Venetian
cry
--
all
talk
there
,
wherever
uttered
,
having
the
pitch
of
*NL*
a
call
across
the
water
--
come
in
once
more
at
the
window
,
renewing
one
's
*NL*
old
impression
of
the
delighted
senses
and
the
divided
,
frustrated
mind
.
*NL*
How
can
places
that
speak
IN
GENERAL
so
to
the
imagination
not
give
*NL*
it
,
at
the
moment
,
the
particular
thing
it
wants
?
I
recollect
again
*NL*
and
again
,
in
beautiful
places
,
dropping
into
that
wonderment
.
The
*NL*
real
truth
is
,
I
think
,
that
they
express
,
under
this
appeal
,
only
too
*NL*
much
--
more
than
,
in
the
given
case
,
one
has
use
for
;
so
that
one
*NL*
finds
one
's
self
working
less
congruously
,
after
all
,
so
far
as
the
*NL*
surrounding
picture
is
concerned
,
than
in
presence
of
the
moderate
and
*NL*
the
neutral
,
to
which
we
may
lend
something
of
the
light
of
our
vision
.
*NL*
Such
a
place
as
Venice
is
too
proud
for
such
charities
;
Venice
does
n't
*NL*
borrow
,
she
but
all
magnificently
gives
.
We
profit
by
that
enormously
,
*NL*
but
to
do
so
we
must
either
be
quite
off
duty
or
be
on
it
in
her
service
*NL*
alone
.
Such
,
and
so
rueful
,
are
these
reminiscences
;
though
on
the
*NL*
whole
,
no
doubt
,
one
's
book
,
and
one
's
``
literary
effort
''
at
large
,
were
*NL*
to
be
the
better
for
them
.
Strangely
fertilising
,
in
the
long
run
,
does
*NL*
a
wasted
effort
of
attention
often
prove
.
It
all
depends
on
HOW
the
*NL*
attention
has
been
cheated
,
has
been
squandered
.
There
are
high-handed
*NL*
insolent
frauds
,
and
there
are
insidious
sneaking
ones
.
And
there
is
,
*NL*
I
fear
,
even
on
the
most
designing
artist
's
part
,
always
witless
enough
*NL*
good
faith
,
always
anxious
enough
desire
,
to
fail
to
guard
him
against
*NL*
their
deceits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Trying
to
recover
here
,
for
recognition
,
the
germ
of
my
idea
,
I
see
that
*NL*
it
must
have
consisted
not
at
all
in
any
conceit
of
a
``
plot
,
''
nefarious
*NL*
name
,
in
any
flash
,
upon
the
fancy
,
of
a
set
of
relations
,
or
in
any
one
*NL*
of
those
situations
that
,
by
a
logic
of
their
own
,
immediately
fall
,
for
*NL*
the
fabulist
,
into
movement
,
into
a
march
or
a
rush
,
a
patter
of
quick
*NL*
steps
;
but
altogether
in
the
sense
of
a
single
character
,
the
character
*NL*
and
aspect
of
a
particular
engaging
young
woman
,
to
which
all
the
usual
*NL*
elements
of
a
``
subject
,
''
certainly
of
a
setting
,
were
to
need
to
be
*NL*
super
added
.
Quite
as
interesting
as
the
young
woman
herself
at
her
*NL*
best
,
do
I
find
,
I
must
again
repeat
,
this
projection
of
memory
upon
the
*NL*
whole
matter
of
the
growth
,
in
one
's
imagination
,
of
some
such
apology
*NL*
for
a
motive
.
These
are
the
fascinations
of
the
fabulist
's
art
,
these
*NL*
lurking
forces
of
expansion
,
these
necessities
of
upspringing
in
*NL*
the
seed
,
these
beautiful
determinations
,
on
the
part
of
the
idea
*NL*
entertained
,
to
grow
as
tall
as
possible
,
to
push
into
the
light
and
*NL*
the
air
and
thickly
flower
there
;
and
,
quite
as
much
,
these
fine
*NL*
possibilities
of
recovering
,
from
some
good
standpoint
on
the
ground
*NL*
gained
,
the
intimate
history
of
the
business
--
of
retracing
and
*NL*
reconstructing
its
steps
and
stages
.
I
have
always
fondly
remembered
a
*NL*
remark
that
I
heard
fall
years
ago
from
the
lips
of
Ivan
Turgenieff
in
*NL*
regard
to
his
own
experience
of
the
usual
origin
of
the
fictive
picture
.
*NL*
It
began
for
him
almost
always
with
the
vision
of
some
person
or
*NL*
persons
,
who
hovered
before
him
,
soliciting
him
,
as
the
active
or
*NL*
passive
figure
,
interesting
him
and
appealing
to
him
just
as
they
were
*NL*
and
by
what
they
were
.
He
saw
them
,
in
that
fashion
,
as
disponibles
,
*NL*
saw
them
subject
to
the
chances
,
the
complications
of
existence
,
and
saw
*NL*
them
vividly
,
but
then
had
to
find
for
them
the
right
relations
,
those
*NL*
that
would
most
bring
them
out
;
to
imagine
,
to
invent
and
select
and
*NL*
piece
together
the
situations
most
useful
and
favourable
to
the
sense
of
*NL*
the
creatures
themselves
,
the
complications
they
would
be
most
likely
to
*NL*
produce
and
to
feel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
arrive
at
these
things
is
to
arrive
at
my
story
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
*NL*
that
's
the
way
I
look
for
it
.
The
result
is
that
I
'm
often
accused
*NL*
of
not
having
`
story
'
enough
.
I
seem
to
myself
to
have
as
much
as
I
*NL*
need
--
to
show
my
people
,
to
exhibit
their
relations
with
each
other
;
*NL*
for
that
is
all
my
measure
.
If
I
watch
them
long
enough
I
see
them
come
*NL*
together
,
I
see
them
PLACED
,
I
see
them
engaged
in
this
or
that
act
and
*NL*
in
this
or
that
difficulty
.
How
they
look
and
move
and
speak
and
behave
,
*NL*
always
in
the
setting
I
have
found
for
them
,
is
my
account
of
them
--
of
*NL*
which
I
dare
say
,
alas
,
que
cela
manque
souvent
d'architecture
.
But
I
*NL*
would
rather
,
I
think
,
have
too
little
architecture
than
too
much
--
when
*NL*
there
's
danger
of
its
interfering
with
my
measure
of
the
truth
.
The
*NL*
French
of
course
like
more
of
it
than
I
give
--
having
by
their
own
genius
*NL*
such
a
hand
for
it
;
and
indeed
one
must
give
all
one
can
.
As
for
the
*NL*
origin
of
one
's
wind-blown
germs
themselves
,
who
shall
say
,
as
you
ask
,
*NL*
where
THEY
come
from
?
We
have
to
go
too
far
back
,
too
far
behind
,
*NL*
to
say
.
Is
n't
it
all
we
can
say
that
they
come
from
every
quarter
*NL*
of
heaven
,
that
they
are
THERE
at
almost
any
turn
of
the
road
?
They
*NL*
accumulate
,
and
we
are
always
picking
them
over
,
selecting
among
them
.
*NL*
They
are
the
breath
of
life
--
by
which
I
mean
that
life
,
in
its
own
*NL*
way
,
breathes
them
upon
us
.
They
are
so
,
in
a
manner
prescribed
and
*NL*
imposed
--
floated
into
our
minds
by
the
current
of
life
.
That
reduces
to
*NL*
imbecility
the
vain
critic
's
quarrel
,
so
often
,
with
one
's
subject
,
when
*NL*
he
has
n't
the
wit
to
accept
it
.
Will
he
point
out
then
which
other
it
*NL*
should
properly
have
been
?
--
his
office
being
,
essentially
to
point
out
.
*NL*
Il
en
serait
bien
embarrasse
.
Ah
,
when
he
points
out
what
I
've
done
or
*NL*
failed
to
do
with
it
,
that
's
another
matter
:
there
he
's
on
his
ground
.
I
*NL*
give
him
up
my
`
sarchitecture
,
'
''
my
distinguished
friend
concluded
,
``
as
*NL*
much
as
he
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
this
beautiful
genius
,
and
I
recall
with
comfort
the
gratitude
I
drew
*NL*
from
his
reference
to
the
intensity
of
suggestion
that
may
reside
in
the
*NL*
stray
figure
,
the
unattached
character
,
the
image
en
disponibilite
.
*NL*
It
gave
me
higher
warrant
than
I
seemed
then
to
have
met
for
just
*NL*
that
blest
habit
of
one
's
own
imagination
,
the
trick
of
investing
some
*NL*
conceived
or
encountered
individual
,
some
brace
or
group
of
individuals
,
*NL*
with
the
germinal
property
and
authority
.
I
was
myself
so
much
more
*NL*
antecedently
conscious
of
my
figures
than
of
their
setting
--
a
too
*NL*
preliminary
,
a
preferential
interest
in
which
struck
me
as
in
general
*NL*
such
a
putting
of
the
cart
before
the
horse
.
I
might
envy
,
though
I
*NL*
could
n't
emulate
,
the
imaginative
writer
so
constituted
as
to
see
his
*NL*
fable
first
and
to
make
out
its
agents
afterwards
.
I
could
think
so
*NL*
little
of
any
fable
that
did
n't
need
its
agents
positively
to
launch
*NL*
it
;
I
could
think
so
little
of
any
situation
that
did
n't
depend
for
its
*NL*
interest
on
the
nature
of
the
persons
situated
,
and
thereby
on
their
*NL*
way
of
taking
it
.
There
are
methods
of
so-called
presentation
,
I
believe
*NL*
among
novelists
who
have
appeared
to
flourish
--
that
offer
the
situation
*NL*
as
indifferent
to
that
support
;
but
I
have
not
lost
the
sense
of
the
*NL*
value
for
me
,
at
the
time
,
of
the
admirable
Russian
's
testimony
to
my
*NL*
not
needing
,
all
superstitiously
,
to
try
and
perform
any
such
gymnastic
.
*NL*
Other
echoes
from
the
same
source
linger
with
me
,
I
confess
,
as
*NL*
unfadingly
--
if
it
be
not
all
indeed
one
much-embracing
echo
.
It
was
*NL*
impossible
after
that
not
to
read
,
for
one
's
uses
,
high
lucidity
into
*NL*
the
tormented
and
disfigured
and
bemuddled
question
of
the
objective
*NL*
value
,
and
even
quite
into
that
of
the
critical
appreciation
,
of
*NL*
``
subject
''
in
the
novel
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
had
had
from
an
early
time
,
for
that
matter
,
the
instinct
of
the
*NL*
right
estimate
of
such
values
and
of
its
reducing
to
the
inane
the
*NL*
dull
dispute
over
the
``
immoral
''
subject
and
the
moral
.
Recognising
so
*NL*
promptly
the
one
measure
of
the
worth
of
a
given
subject
,
the
question
*NL*
about
it
that
,
rightly
answered
,
disposes
of
all
others
--
is
it
valid
,
*NL*
in
a
word
,
is
it
genuine
,
is
it
sincere
,
the
result
of
some
direct
*NL*
impression
or
perception
of
life
?
--
I
had
found
small
edification
,
*NL*
mostly
,
in
a
critical
pretension
that
had
neglected
from
the
first
*NL*
all
delimitation
of
ground
and
all
definition
of
terms
.
The
air
of
*NL*
my
earlier
time
shows
,
to
memory
,
as
darkened
,
all
round
,
with
that
*NL*
vanity
--
unless
the
difference
to-day
be
just
in
one
's
own
final
*NL*
impatience
,
the
lapse
of
one
's
attention
.
There
is
,
I
think
,
no
more
*NL*
nutritive
or
suggestive
truth
in
this
connexion
than
that
of
the
perfect
*NL*
dependence
of
the
``
moral
''
sense
of
a
work
of
art
on
the
amount
of
felt
*NL*
life
concerned
in
producing
it
.
The
question
comes
back
thus
,
obviously
,
*NL*
to
the
kind
and
the
degree
of
the
artist
's
prime
sensibility
,
which
is
*NL*
the
soil
out
of
which
his
subject
springs
.
The
quality
and
capacity
of
*NL*
that
soil
,
its
ability
to
``
grow
''
with
due
freshness
and
straightness
any
*NL*
vision
of
life
,
represents
,
strongly
or
weakly
,
the
projected
morality
.
*NL*
That
element
is
but
another
name
for
the
more
or
less
close
connexion
of
*NL*
the
subject
with
some
mark
made
on
the
intelligence
,
with
some
sincere
*NL*
experience
.
By
which
,
at
the
same
time
,
of
course
,
one
is
far
from
*NL*
contending
that
this
enveloping
air
of
the
artist
's
humanity
--
which
*NL*
gives
the
last
touch
to
the
worth
of
the
work
--
is
not
a
widely
and
*NL*
wondrously
varying
element
;
being
on
one
occasion
a
rich
and
magnificent
*NL*
medium
and
on
another
a
comparatively
poor
and
ungenerous
one
.
Here
we
*NL*
get
exactly
the
high
price
of
the
novel
as
a
literary
form
--
its
power
*NL*
not
only
,
while
preserving
that
form
with
closeness
,
to
range
*NL*
through
all
the
differences
of
the
individual
relation
to
its
general
*NL*
subject-matter
,
all
the
varieties
of
outlook
on
life
,
of
disposition
to
*NL*
reflect
and
project
,
created
by
conditions
that
are
never
the
same
from
*NL*
man
to
man
-LRB-
or
,
so
far
as
that
goes
,
from
man
to
woman
-RRB-
,
but
positively
*NL*
to
appear
more
true
to
its
character
in
proportion
as
it
strains
,
or
*NL*
tends
to
burst
,
with
a
latent
extravagance
,
its
mould
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
of
fiction
has
in
short
not
one
window
,
but
a
million
--
a
*NL*
number
of
possible
windows
not
to
be
reckoned
,
rather
;
every
one
of
*NL*
which
has
been
pierced
,
or
is
still
pierceable
,
in
its
vast
front
,
by
*NL*
the
need
of
the
individual
vision
and
by
the
pressure
of
the
individual
*NL*
will
.
These
apertures
,
of
dissimilar
shape
and
size
,
hang
so
,
all
*NL*
together
,
over
the
human
scene
that
we
might
have
expected
of
them
a
*NL*
greater
sameness
of
report
than
we
find
.
They
are
but
windows
at
the
*NL*
best
,
mere
holes
in
a
dead
wall
,
disconnected
,
perched
aloft
;
they
are
*NL*
not
hinged
doors
opening
straight
upon
life
.
But
they
have
this
mark
of
*NL*
their
own
that
at
each
of
them
stands
a
figure
with
a
pair
of
eyes
,
*NL*
or
at
least
with
a
field-glass
,
which
forms
,
again
and
again
,
for
*NL*
observation
,
a
unique
instrument
,
insuring
to
the
person
making
use
of
*NL*
it
an
impression
distinct
from
every
other
.
He
and
his
neighbours
are
*NL*
watching
the
same
show
,
but
one
seeing
more
where
the
other
sees
less
,
*NL*
one
seeing
black
where
the
other
sees
white
,
one
seeing
big
where
the
*NL*
other
sees
small
,
one
seeing
coarse
where
the
other
sees
fine
.
And
*NL*
so
on
,
and
so
on
;
there
is
fortunately
no
saying
on
what
,
for
the
*NL*
particular
pair
of
eyes
,
the
window
may
NOT
open
;
``
fortunately
''
by
*NL*
reason
,
precisely
,
of
this
incalculability
of
range
.
The
spreading
*NL*
field
,
the
human
scene
,
is
the
``
choice
of
subject
''
;
the
pierced
*NL*
aperture
,
either
broad
or
balconied
or
slit-like
and
low-browed
,
is
the
*NL*
``
literary
form
''
;
but
they
are
,
singly
or
together
,
as
nothing
without
*NL*
the
posted
presence
of
the
watcher
--
without
,
in
other
words
,
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
the
artist
.
Tell
me
what
the
artist
is
,
and
I
will
tell
*NL*
you
of
what
he
has
BEEN
conscious
.
Thereby
I
shall
express
to
you
at
*NL*
once
his
boundless
freedom
and
his
``
moral
''
reference
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
is
a
long
way
round
,
however
,
for
my
word
about
my
dim
first
*NL*
move
toward
``
The
Portrait
,
''
which
was
exactly
my
grasp
of
a
single
*NL*
character
--
an
acquisition
I
had
made
,
moreover
,
after
a
fashion
not
*NL*
here
to
be
retraced
.
Enough
that
I
was
,
as
seemed
to
me
,
in
complete
*NL*
possession
of
it
,
that
I
had
been
so
for
a
long
time
,
that
this
had
made
*NL*
it
familiar
and
yet
had
not
blurred
its
charm
,
and
that
,
all
urgently
,
*NL*
all
tormentingly
,
I
saw
it
in
motion
and
,
so
to
speak
,
in
transit
.
This
*NL*
amounts
to
saying
that
I
saw
it
as
bent
upon
its
fate
--
some
fate
or
*NL*
other
;
which
,
among
the
possibilities
,
being
precisely
the
question
.
*NL*
Thus
I
had
my
vivid
individual
--
vivid
,
so
strangely
,
in
spite
of
being
*NL*
still
at
large
,
not
confined
by
the
conditions
,
not
engaged
in
the
*NL*
tangle
,
to
which
we
look
for
much
of
the
impress
that
constitutes
an
*NL*
identity
.
If
the
apparition
was
still
all
to
be
placed
how
came
it
to
*NL*
be
vivid
?
--
since
we
puzzle
such
quantities
out
,
mostly
,
just
by
the
*NL*
business
of
placing
them
.
One
could
answer
such
a
question
beautifully
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
if
one
could
do
so
subtle
,
if
not
so
monstrous
,
a
thing
as
to
*NL*
write
the
history
of
the
growth
of
one
's
imagination
.
One
would
describe
*NL*
then
what
,
at
a
given
time
,
had
extraordinarily
happened
to
it
,
and
one
*NL*
would
so
,
for
instance
,
be
in
a
position
to
tell
,
with
an
approach
to
*NL*
clearness
,
how
,
under
favour
of
occasion
,
it
had
been
able
to
take
over
*NL*
-LRB-
take
over
straight
from
life
-RRB-
such
and
such
a
constituted
,
animated
*NL*
figure
or
form
.
The
figure
has
to
that
extent
,
as
you
see
,
BEEN
*NL*
placed
--
placed
in
the
imagination
that
detains
it
,
preserves
,
*NL*
protects
,
enjoys
it
,
conscious
of
its
presence
in
the
dusky
,
crowded
,
*NL*
heterogeneous
back-shop
of
the
mind
very
much
as
a
wary
dealer
in
*NL*
precious
odds
and
ends
,
competent
to
make
an
``
advance
''
on
rare
objects
*NL*
confided
to
him
,
is
conscious
of
the
rare
little
``
piece
''
left
in
deposit
*NL*
by
the
reduced
,
mysterious
lady
of
title
or
the
speculative
amateur
,
*NL*
and
which
is
already
there
to
disclose
its
merit
afresh
as
soon
as
a
key
*NL*
shall
have
clicked
in
a
cupboard-door
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
may
he
,
I
recognise
,
a
somewhat
superfine
analogy
for
the
*NL*
particular
``
value
''
I
here
speak
of
,
the
image
of
the
young
feminine
*NL*
nature
that
I
had
had
for
so
considerable
a
time
all
curiously
at
my
*NL*
disposal
;
but
it
appears
to
fond
memory
quite
to
fit
the
fact
--
with
the
*NL*
recall
,
in
addition
,
of
my
pious
desire
but
to
place
my
treasure
right
.
*NL*
I
quite
remind
myself
thus
of
the
dealer
resigned
not
to
``
realise
,
''
*NL*
resigned
to
keeping
the
precious
object
locked
up
indefinitely
rather
*NL*
than
commit
it
,
at
no
matter
what
price
,
to
vulgar
hands
.
For
there
*NL*
ARE
dealers
in
these
forms
and
figures
and
treasures
capable
of
that
*NL*
refinement
.
The
point
is
,
however
,
that
this
single
small
corner-stone
,
*NL*
the
conception
of
a
certain
young
woman
affronting
her
destiny
,
had
*NL*
begun
with
being
all
my
outfit
for
the
large
building
of
``
The
Portrait
*NL*
of
a
Lady
.
''
It
came
to
be
a
square
and
spacious
house
--
or
has
at
least
*NL*
seemed
so
to
me
in
this
going
over
it
again
;
but
,
such
as
it
is
,
it
*NL*
had
to
be
put
up
round
my
young
woman
while
she
stood
there
in
perfect
*NL*
isolation
.
That
is
to
me
,
artistically
speaking
,
the
circumstance
of
*NL*
interest
;
for
I
have
lost
myself
once
more
,
I
confess
,
in
the
curiosity
*NL*
of
analysing
the
structure
.
By
what
process
of
logical
accretion
was
*NL*
this
slight
``
personality
,
''
the
mere
slim
shade
of
an
intelligent
but
*NL*
presumptuous
girl
,
to
find
itself
endowed
with
the
high
attributes
of
a
*NL*
Subject
?
--
and
indeed
by
what
thinness
,
at
the
best
,
would
such
a
subject
*NL*
not
be
vitiated
?
Millions
of
presumptuous
girls
,
intelligent
or
not
*NL*
intelligent
,
daily
affront
their
destiny
,
and
what
is
it
open
to
their
*NL*
destiny
to
be
,
at
the
most
,
that
we
should
make
an
ado
about
it
?
The
*NL*
novel
is
of
its
very
nature
an
``
ado
,
''
an
ado
about
something
,
and
the
*NL*
larger
the
form
it
takes
the
greater
of
course
the
ado
.
Therefore
,
*NL*
consciously
,
that
was
what
one
was
in
for
--
for
positively
organising
an
*NL*
ado
about
Isabel
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
looked
it
well
in
the
face
,
I
seem
to
remember
,
this
extravagance
;
*NL*
and
with
the
effect
precisely
of
recognising
the
charm
of
the
problem
.
*NL*
Challenge
any
such
problem
with
any
intelligence
,
and
you
immediately
*NL*
see
how
full
it
is
of
substance
;
the
wonder
being
,
all
the
while
,
as
we
*NL*
look
at
the
world
,
how
absolutely
,
how
inordinately
,
the
Isabel
Archers
,
*NL*
and
even
much
smaller
female
fry
,
insist
on
mattering
.
George
Eliot
has
*NL*
admirably
noted
it
--
``
In
these
frail
vessels
is
borne
onward
through
the
*NL*
ages
the
treasure
of
human
affection
.
''
In
``
Romeo
and
Juliet
''
Juliet
has
*NL*
to
be
important
,
just
as
,
in
``
Adam
Bede
''
and
``
The
Mill
on
the
Floss
''
and
*NL*
``
Middlemarch
''
and
``
Daniel
Deronda
,
''
Hetty
Sorrel
and
Maggie
Tulliver
and
*NL*
Rosamond
Vincy
and
Gwendolen
Harleth
have
to
be
;
with
that
much
of
firm
*NL*
ground
,
that
much
of
bracing
air
,
at
the
disposal
all
the
while
of
*NL*
their
feet
and
their
lungs
.
They
are
typical
,
none
the
less
,
of
a
class
*NL*
difficult
,
in
the
individual
case
,
to
make
a
centre
of
interest
;
so
*NL*
difficult
in
fact
that
many
an
expert
painter
,
as
for
instance
Dickens
*NL*
and
Walter
Scott
,
as
for
instance
even
,
in
the
main
,
so
subtle
a
hand
*NL*
as
that
of
R.
L.
Stevenson
,
has
preferred
to
leave
the
task
unattempted
.
*NL*
There
are
in
fact
writers
as
to
whom
we
make
out
that
their
refuge
*NL*
from
this
is
to
assume
it
to
be
not
worth
their
attempting
;
by
which
*NL*
pusillanimity
in
truth
their
honour
is
scantly
saved
.
It
is
never
an
*NL*
attestation
of
a
value
,
or
even
of
our
imperfect
sense
of
one
,
it
is
*NL*
never
a
tribute
to
any
truth
at
all
,
that
we
shall
represent
that
value
*NL*
badly
.
It
never
makes
up
,
artistically
,
for
an
artist
's
dim
feeling
*NL*
about
a
thing
that
he
shall
``
do
''
the
thing
as
ill
as
possible
.
There
are
*NL*
better
ways
than
that
,
the
best
of
all
of
which
is
to
begin
with
less
*NL*
stupidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
answered
meanwhile
,
in
regard
to
Shakespeare
's
and
to
George
*NL*
Eliot
's
testimony
,
that
their
concession
to
the
``
importance
''
of
their
*NL*
Juliets
and
Cleopatras
and
Portias
-LRB-
even
with
Portia
as
the
very
type
*NL*
and
model
of
the
young
person
intelligent
and
presumptuous
-RRB-
and
to
that
*NL*
of
their
Hettys
and
Maggies
and
Rosamonds
and
Gwendolens
,
suffers
the
*NL*
abatement
that
these
slimnesses
are
,
when
figuring
as
the
main
props
of
*NL*
the
theme
,
never
suffered
to
be
sole
ministers
of
its
appeal
,
but
have
*NL*
their
inadequacy
eked
out
with
comic
relief
and
underplots
,
as
the
*NL*
playwrights
say
,
when
not
with
murders
and
battles
and
the
great
*NL*
mutations
of
the
world
.
If
they
are
shown
as
``
mattering
''
as
much
as
*NL*
they
could
possibly
pretend
to
,
the
proof
of
it
is
in
a
hundred
other
*NL*
persons
,
made
of
much
stouter
stuff
;
and
each
involved
moreover
in
a
*NL*
hundred
relations
which
matter
to
THEM
concomitantly
with
that
one
.
*NL*
Cleopatra
matters
,
beyond
bounds
,
to
Antony
,
but
his
colleagues
,
*NL*
his
antagonists
,
the
state
of
Rome
and
the
impending
battle
also
*NL*
prodigiously
matter
;
Portia
matters
to
Antonio
,
and
to
Shylock
,
and
*NL*
to
the
Prince
of
Morocco
,
to
the
fifty
aspiring
princes
,
but
for
these
*NL*
gentry
there
are
other
lively
concerns
;
for
Antonio
,
notably
,
there
*NL*
are
Shylock
and
Bassanio
and
his
lost
ventures
and
the
extremity
of
*NL*
his
predicament
.
This
extremity
indeed
,
by
the
same
token
,
matters
to
*NL*
Portia
--
though
its
doing
so
becomes
of
interest
all
by
the
fact
that
*NL*
Portia
matters
to
US
.
That
she
does
so
,
at
any
rate
,
and
that
almost
*NL*
everything
comes
round
to
it
again
,
supports
my
contention
as
to
this
*NL*
fine
example
of
the
value
recognised
in
the
mere
young
thing
.
-LRB-
I
say
*NL*
``
mere
''
young
thing
because
I
guess
that
even
Shakespeare
,
preoccupied
*NL*
mainly
though
he
may
have
been
with
the
passions
of
princes
,
would
*NL*
scarce
have
pretended
to
found
the
best
of
his
appeal
for
her
on
her
*NL*
high
social
position
.
-RRB-
It
is
an
example
exactly
of
the
deep
difficulty
*NL*
braved
--
the
difficulty
of
making
George
Eliot
's
``
frail
vessel
,
''
if
not
*NL*
the
all-in-all
for
our
attention
,
at
least
the
clearest
of
the
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
to
see
deep
difficulty
braved
is
at
any
time
,
for
the
really
*NL*
addicted
artist
,
to
feel
almost
even
as
a
pang
the
beautiful
incentive
,
*NL*
and
to
feel
it
verily
in
such
sort
as
to
wish
the
danger
intensified
.
*NL*
The
difficulty
most
worth
tackling
can
only
be
for
him
,
in
these
*NL*
conditions
,
the
greatest
the
case
permits
of
.
So
I
remember
feeling
*NL*
here
-LRB-
in
presence
,
always
,
that
is
,
of
the
particular
uncertainty
of
my
*NL*
ground
-RRB-
,
that
there
would
be
one
way
better
than
another
--
oh
,
ever
so
*NL*
much
better
than
any
other
!
--
of
making
it
fight
out
its
battle
.
The
*NL*
frail
vessel
,
that
charged
with
George
Eliot
's
``
treasure
,
''
and
thereby
*NL*
of
such
importance
to
those
who
curiously
approach
it
,
has
likewise
*NL*
possibilities
of
importance
to
itself
,
possibilities
which
permit
of
*NL*
treatment
and
in
fact
peculiarly
require
it
from
the
moment
they
are
*NL*
considered
at
all
.
There
is
always
the
escape
from
any
close
account
*NL*
of
the
weak
agent
of
such
spells
by
using
as
a
bridge
for
evasion
,
for
*NL*
retreat
and
flight
,
the
view
of
her
relation
to
those
surrounding
her
.
*NL*
Make
it
predominantly
a
view
of
THEIR
relation
and
the
trick
is
played
:
*NL*
you
give
the
general
sense
of
her
effect
,
and
you
give
it
,
so
far
as
the
*NL*
raising
on
it
of
a
superstructure
goes
,
with
the
maximum
of
ease
.
Well
,
*NL*
I
recall
perfectly
how
little
,
in
my
now
quite
established
connexion
,
*NL*
the
maximum
of
ease
appealed
to
me
,
and
how
I
seemed
to
get
rid
of
it
*NL*
by
an
honest
transposition
of
the
weights
in
the
two
scales
.
``
Place
the
*NL*
centre
of
the
subject
in
the
young
woman
's
own
consciousness
,
''
I
said
to
*NL*
myself
,
``
and
you
get
as
interesting
and
as
beautiful
a
difficulty
as
you
*NL*
could
wish
.
Stick
to
THAT
--
for
the
centre
;
put
the
heaviest
weight
*NL*
into
THAT
scale
,
which
will
be
so
largely
the
scale
of
her
relation
*NL*
to
herself
.
Make
her
only
interested
enough
,
at
the
same
time
,
in
the
*NL*
things
that
are
not
herself
,
and
this
relation
need
n't
fear
to
be
too
*NL*
limited
.
Place
meanwhile
in
the
other
scale
the
lighter
weight
-LRB-
which
is
*NL*
usually
the
one
that
tips
the
balance
of
interest
-RRB-
:
press
least
hard
,
in
*NL*
short
,
on
the
consciousness
of
your
heroine
's
satellites
,
especially
the
*NL*
male
;
make
it
an
interest
contributive
only
to
the
greater
one
.
See
,
at
*NL*
all
events
,
what
can
be
done
in
this
way
.
What
better
field
could
there
*NL*
be
for
a
due
ingenuity
?
The
girl
hovers
,
inextinguishable
,
as
a
charming
*NL*
creature
,
and
the
job
will
be
to
translate
her
into
the
highest
terms
*NL*
of
that
formula
,
and
as
nearly
as
possible
moreover
into
ALL
of
them
.
To
*NL*
depend
upon
her
and
her
little
concerns
wholly
to
see
you
through
will
*NL*
necessitate
,
remember
,
your
really
`
doing
'
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
I
reasoned
,
and
it
took
nothing
less
than
that
technical
rigour
,
*NL*
I
now
easily
see
,
to
inspire
me
with
the
right
confidence
for
erecting
*NL*
on
such
a
plot
of
ground
the
neat
and
careful
and
proportioned
pile
of
*NL*
bricks
that
arches
over
it
and
that
was
thus
to
form
,
constructionally
*NL*
speaking
,
a
literary
monument
.
Such
is
the
aspect
that
to-day
``
The
*NL*
Portrait
''
wears
for
me
:
a
structure
reared
with
an
``
architectural
''
*NL*
competence
,
as
Turgenieff
would
have
said
,
that
makes
it
,
to
the
*NL*
author
's
own
sense
,
the
most
proportioned
of
his
productions
after
``
The
*NL*
Ambassadors
''
which
was
to
follow
it
so
many
years
later
and
which
has
,
*NL*
no
doubt
,
a
superior
roundness
.
On
one
thing
I
was
determined
;
that
,
*NL*
though
I
should
clearly
have
to
pile
brick
upon
brick
for
the
creation
*NL*
of
an
interest
,
I
would
leave
no
pretext
for
saying
that
anything
is
*NL*
out
of
line
,
scale
or
perspective
.
I
would
build
large
--
in
fine
embossed
*NL*
vaults
and
painted
arches
,
as
who
should
say
,
and
yet
never
let
it
*NL*
appear
that
the
chequered
pavement
,
the
ground
under
the
reader
's
*NL*
feet
,
fails
to
stretch
at
every
point
to
the
base
of
the
walls
.
That
*NL*
precautionary
spirit
,
on
re-perusal
of
the
book
,
is
the
old
note
that
*NL*
most
touches
me
:
it
testifies
so
,
for
my
own
ear
,
to
the
anxiety
of
my
*NL*
provision
for
the
reader
's
amusement
.
I
felt
,
in
view
of
the
possible
*NL*
limitations
of
my
subject
,
that
no
such
provision
could
be
excessive
,
*NL*
and
the
development
of
the
latter
was
simply
the
general
form
of
that
*NL*
earnest
quest
.
And
I
find
indeed
that
this
is
the
only
account
I
can
*NL*
give
myself
of
the
evolution
of
the
fable
it
is
all
under
the
head
thus
*NL*
named
that
I
conceive
the
needful
accretion
as
having
taken
place
,
the
*NL*
right
complications
as
having
started
.
It
was
naturally
of
the
essence
*NL*
that
the
young
woman
should
be
herself
complex
;
that
was
rudimentary
--
or
*NL*
was
at
any
rate
the
light
in
which
Isabel
Archer
had
originally
dawned
.
*NL*
It
went
,
however
,
but
a
certain
way
,
and
other
lights
,
contending
,
*NL*
conflicting
lights
,
and
of
as
many
different
colours
,
if
possible
,
as
*NL*
the
rockets
,
the
Roman
candles
and
Catherine-wheels
of
a
``
pyrotechnic
*NL*
display
,
''
would
be
employable
to
attest
that
she
was
.
I
had
,
no
doubt
,
a
*NL*
groping
instinct
for
the
right
complications
,
since
I
am
quite
unable
*NL*
to
track
the
footsteps
of
those
that
constitute
,
as
the
case
stands
,
the
*NL*
general
situation
exhibited
.
They
are
there
,
for
what
they
are
worth
,
*NL*
and
as
numerous
as
might
be
;
but
my
memory
,
I
confess
,
is
a
blank
as
to
*NL*
how
and
whence
they
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
seem
to
myself
to
have
waked
up
one
morning
in
possession
of
them
--
of
*NL*
Ralph
Touchett
and
his
parents
,
of
Madame
Merle
,
of
Gilbert
Osmond
and
*NL*
his
daughter
and
his
sister
,
of
Lord
Warburton
,
Caspar
Goodwood
and
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
,
the
definite
array
of
contributions
to
Isabel
Archer
's
*NL*
history
.
I
recognised
them
,
I
knew
them
,
they
were
the
numbered
pieces
*NL*
of
my
puzzle
,
the
concrete
terms
of
my
``
plot
.
''
It
was
as
if
they
had
*NL*
simply
,
by
an
impulse
of
their
own
,
floated
into
my
ken
,
and
all
in
*NL*
response
to
my
primary
question
:
``
Well
,
what
will
she
DO
?
''
Their
answer
*NL*
seemed
to
be
that
if
I
would
trust
them
they
would
show
me
;
on
which
,
*NL*
with
an
urgent
appeal
to
them
to
make
it
at
least
as
interesting
as
*NL*
they
could
,
I
trusted
them
.
They
were
like
the
group
of
attendants
and
*NL*
entertainers
who
come
down
by
train
when
people
in
the
country
give
a
*NL*
party
;
they
represented
the
contract
for
carrying
the
party
on
.
That
was
*NL*
an
excellent
relation
with
them
--
a
possible
one
even
with
so
broken
a
*NL*
reed
-LRB-
from
her
slightness
of
cohesion
-RRB-
as
Henrietta
Stackpole
.
It
is
a
*NL*
familiar
truth
to
the
novelist
,
at
the
strenuous
hour
,
that
,
as
certain
*NL*
elements
in
any
work
are
of
the
essence
,
so
others
are
only
of
the
*NL*
form
;
that
as
this
or
that
character
,
this
or
that
disposition
of
the
*NL*
material
,
belongs
to
the
subject
directly
,
so
to
speak
,
so
this
or
that
*NL*
other
belongs
to
it
but
indirectly
--
belongs
intimately
to
the
treatment
.
*NL*
This
is
a
truth
,
however
,
of
which
he
rarely
gets
the
benefit
--
since
it
*NL*
could
be
assured
to
him
,
really
,
but
by
criticism
based
upon
perception
,
*NL*
criticism
which
is
too
little
of
this
world
.
He
must
not
think
of
*NL*
benefits
,
moreover
,
I
freely
recognise
,
for
that
way
dishonour
lies
:
*NL*
he
has
,
that
is
,
but
one
to
think
of
--
the
benefit
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
*NL*
involved
in
his
having
cast
a
spell
upon
the
simpler
,
the
very
simplest
,
*NL*
forms
of
attention
.
This
is
all
he
is
entitled
to
;
he
is
entitled
to
*NL*
nothing
,
he
is
bound
to
admit
,
that
can
come
to
him
,
from
the
reader
,
as
*NL*
a
result
on
the
latter
's
part
of
any
act
of
reflexion
or
discrimination
.
*NL*
He
may
ENJOY
this
finer
tribute
--
that
is
another
affair
,
but
on
*NL*
condition
only
of
taking
it
as
a
gratuity
``
thrown
in
,
''
a
mere
miraculous
*NL*
windfall
,
the
fruit
of
a
tree
he
may
not
pretend
to
have
shaken
.
Against
*NL*
reflexion
,
against
discrimination
,
in
his
interest
,
all
earth
and
air
*NL*
conspire
;
wherefore
it
is
that
,
as
I
say
,
he
must
in
many
a
case
have
*NL*
schooled
himself
,
from
the
first
,
to
work
but
for
a
``
living
wage
.
''
The
*NL*
living
wage
is
the
reader
's
grant
of
the
least
possible
quantity
of
*NL*
attention
required
for
consciousness
of
a
``
spell
.
''
The
occasional
*NL*
charming
``
tip
''
is
an
act
of
his
intelligence
over
and
beyond
this
,
a
*NL*
golden
apple
,
for
the
writer
's
lap
,
straight
from
the
wind-stirred
tree
.
*NL*
The
artist
may
of
course
,
in
wanton
moods
,
dream
of
some
Paradise
-LRB-
for
*NL*
art
-RRB-
where
the
direct
appeal
to
the
intelligence
might
be
legalised
;
for
*NL*
to
such
extravagances
as
these
his
yearning
mind
can
scarce
hope
ever
*NL*
completely
to
close
itself
.
The
most
he
can
do
is
to
remember
they
ARE
*NL*
extravagances
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
which
is
perhaps
but
a
gracefully
devious
way
of
saying
that
*NL*
Henrietta
Stackpole
was
a
good
example
,
in
``
The
Portrait
,
''
of
the
truth
*NL*
to
which
I
just
adverted
--
as
good
an
example
as
I
could
name
were
it
not
*NL*
that
Maria
Gostrey
,
in
``
The
Ambassadors
,
''
then
in
the
bosom
of
time
,
*NL*
may
be
mentioned
as
a
better
.
Each
of
these
persons
is
but
wheels
to
the
*NL*
coach
;
neither
belongs
to
the
body
of
that
vehicle
,
or
is
for
a
moment
*NL*
accommodated
with
a
seat
inside
.
There
the
subject
alone
is
ensconced
,
*NL*
in
the
form
of
its
``
hero
and
heroine
,
''
and
of
the
privileged
high
*NL*
officials
,
say
,
who
ride
with
the
king
and
queen
.
There
are
reasons
*NL*
why
one
would
have
liked
this
to
be
felt
,
as
in
general
one
would
like
*NL*
almost
anything
to
be
felt
,
in
one
's
work
,
that
one
has
one
's
self
*NL*
contributively
felt
.
We
have
seen
,
however
,
how
idle
is
that
pretension
,
*NL*
which
I
should
be
sorry
to
make
too
much
of
.
Maria
Gostrey
and
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
then
are
cases
,
each
,
of
the
light
ficelle
,
not
of
the
true
*NL*
agent
;
they
may
run
beside
the
coach
``
for
all
they
are
worth
,
''
they
may
*NL*
cling
to
it
till
they
are
out
of
breath
-LRB-
as
poor
Miss
Stackpole
all
so
*NL*
visibly
does
-RRB-
,
but
neither
,
all
the
while
,
so
much
as
gets
her
foot
on
*NL*
the
step
,
neither
ceases
for
a
moment
to
tread
the
dusty
road
.
Put
it
*NL*
even
that
they
are
like
the
fishwives
who
helped
to
bring
back
to
Paris
*NL*
from
Versailles
,
on
that
most
ominous
day
of
the
first
half
of
the
*NL*
French
Revolution
,
the
carriage
of
the
royal
family
.
The
only
thing
*NL*
is
that
I
may
well
be
asked
,
I
acknowledge
,
why
then
,
in
the
present
*NL*
fiction
,
I
have
suffered
Henrietta
-LRB-
of
whom
we
have
indubitably
too
*NL*
much
-RRB-
so
officiously
,
so
strangely
,
so
almost
inexplicably
,
to
pervade
.
*NL*
I
will
presently
say
what
I
can
for
that
anomaly
--
and
in
the
most
*NL*
conciliatory
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
point
I
wish
still
more
to
make
is
that
if
my
relation
of
confidence
*NL*
with
the
actors
in
my
drama
who
WERE
,
unlike
Miss
Stackpole
,
true
*NL*
agents
,
was
an
excellent
one
to
have
arrived
at
,
there
still
remained
my
*NL*
relation
with
the
reader
,
which
was
another
affair
altogether
and
as
to
*NL*
which
I
felt
no
one
to
be
trusted
but
myself
.
That
solicitude
was
to
be
*NL*
accordingly
expressed
in
the
artful
patience
with
which
,
as
I
have
*NL*
said
,
I
piled
brick
upon
brick
.
The
bricks
,
for
the
whole
*NL*
counting-over
--
putting
for
bricks
little
touches
and
inventions
and
*NL*
enhancements
by
the
way
--
affect
me
in
truth
as
well-nigh
innumerable
and
*NL*
as
ever
so
scrupulously
fitted
together
and
packed-in
.
It
is
an
effect
*NL*
of
detail
,
of
the
minutest
;
though
,
if
one
were
in
this
connexion
to
say
*NL*
all
,
one
would
express
the
hope
that
the
general
,
the
ampler
air
of
the
*NL*
modest
monument
still
survives
.
I
do
at
least
seem
to
catch
the
key
to
*NL*
a
part
of
this
abundance
of
small
anxious
,
ingenious
illustration
as
I
*NL*
recollect
putting
my
finger
,
in
my
young
woman
's
interest
,
on
the
most
*NL*
obvious
of
her
predicates
.
``
What
will
she
`
do
'
?
Why
,
the
first
thing
*NL*
she
'll
do
will
be
to
come
to
Europe
;
which
in
fact
will
form
,
and
all
*NL*
inevitably
,
no
small
part
of
her
principal
adventure
.
Coming
to
*NL*
Europe
is
even
for
the
`
frail
vessels
,
'
in
this
wonderful
age
,
a
mild
*NL*
adventure
;
but
what
is
truer
than
that
on
one
side
--
the
side
of
their
*NL*
independence
of
flood
and
field
,
of
the
moving
accident
,
of
battle
and
*NL*
murder
and
sudden
death
--
her
adventures
are
to
be
mild
?
Without
her
*NL*
sense
of
them
,
her
sense
FOR
them
,
as
one
may
say
,
they
are
next
to
*NL*
nothing
at
all
;
but
is
n't
the
beauty
and
the
difficulty
just
in
showing
*NL*
their
mystic
conversion
by
that
sense
,
conversion
into
the
stuff
of
*NL*
drama
or
,
even
more
delightful
word
still
,
of
`
story
'
?
''
It
was
all
*NL*
as
clear
,
my
contention
,
as
a
silver
bell
.
Two
very
good
instances
,
I
*NL*
think
,
of
this
effect
of
conversion
,
two
cases
of
the
rare
chemistry
,
*NL*
are
the
pages
in
which
Isabel
,
coming
into
the
drawing-room
at
*NL*
Gardencourt
,
coming
in
from
a
wet
walk
or
whatever
,
that
rainy
*NL*
afternoon
,
finds
Madame
Merle
in
possession
of
the
place
,
Madame
*NL*
Merle
seated
,
all
absorbed
but
all
serene
,
at
the
piano
,
and
deeply
*NL*
recognises
,
in
the
striking
of
such
an
hour
,
in
the
presence
there
,
*NL*
among
the
gathering
shades
,
of
this
personage
,
of
whom
a
moment
before
*NL*
she
had
never
so
much
as
heard
,
a
turning-point
in
her
life
.
It
is
*NL*
dreadful
to
have
too
much
,
for
any
artistic
demonstration
,
to
dot
one
's
*NL*
i
's
and
insist
on
one
's
intentions
,
and
I
am
not
eager
to
do
it
now
;
but
*NL*
the
question
here
was
that
of
producing
the
maximum
of
intensity
with
*NL*
the
minimum
of
strain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interest
was
to
be
raised
to
its
pitch
and
yet
the
elements
to
be
*NL*
kept
in
their
key
;
so
that
,
should
the
whole
thing
duly
impress
,
I
might
*NL*
show
what
an
``
exciting
''
inward
life
may
do
for
the
person
leading
it
*NL*
even
while
it
remains
perfectly
normal
.
And
I
can
not
think
of
a
more
*NL*
consistent
application
of
that
ideal
unless
it
be
in
the
long
statement
,
*NL*
just
beyond
the
middle
of
the
book
,
of
my
young
woman
's
extraordinary
*NL*
meditative
vigil
on
the
occasion
that
was
to
become
for
her
such
a
*NL*
landmark
.
Reduced
to
its
essence
,
it
is
but
the
vigil
of
searching
*NL*
criticism
;
but
it
throws
the
action
further
forward
that
twenty
*NL*
``
incidents
''
might
have
done
.
It
was
designed
to
have
all
the
vivacity
*NL*
of
incidents
and
all
the
economy
of
picture
.
She
sits
up
,
by
her
dying
*NL*
fire
,
far
into
the
night
,
under
the
spell
of
recognitions
on
which
she
*NL*
finds
the
last
sharpness
suddenly
wait
.
It
is
a
representation
simply
*NL*
of
her
motionlessly
SEEING
,
and
an
attempt
withal
to
make
the
mere
still
*NL*
lucidity
of
her
act
as
``
interesting
''
as
the
surprise
of
a
caravan
or
the
*NL*
identification
of
a
pirate
.
It
represents
,
for
that
matter
,
one
of
the
*NL*
identifications
dear
to
the
novelist
,
and
even
indispensable
to
him
;
*NL*
but
it
all
goes
on
without
her
being
approached
by
another
person
and
*NL*
without
her
leaving
her
chair
.
It
is
obviously
the
best
thing
in
the
*NL*
book
,
but
it
is
only
a
supreme
illustration
of
the
general
plan
.
As
to
*NL*
Henrietta
,
my
apology
for
whom
I
just
left
incomplete
,
she
exemplifies
,
*NL*
I
fear
,
in
her
superabundance
,
not
an
element
of
my
plan
,
but
only
*NL*
an
excess
of
my
zeal
.
So
early
was
to
begin
my
tendency
to
OVERTREAT
,
*NL*
rather
than
undertreat
-LRB-
when
there
was
choice
or
danger
-RRB-
my
subject
.
*NL*
-LRB-
Many
members
of
my
craft
,
I
gather
,
are
far
from
agreeing
with
me
,
but
*NL*
I
have
always
held
overtreating
the
minor
disservice
.
-RRB-
``
Treating
''
that
*NL*
of
``
The
Portrait
''
amounted
to
never
forgetting
,
by
any
lapse
,
that
the
*NL*
thing
was
under
a
special
obligation
to
be
amusing
.
There
was
the
danger
*NL*
of
the
noted
``
thinness
''
--
which
was
to
be
averted
,
tooth
and
nail
,
*NL*
by
cultivation
of
the
lively
.
That
is
at
least
how
I
see
it
to-day
.
*NL*
Henrietta
must
have
been
at
that
time
a
part
of
my
wonderful
notion
of
*NL*
the
lively
.
And
then
there
was
another
matter
.
I
had
,
within
the
few
*NL*
preceding
years
,
come
to
live
in
London
,
and
the
``
international
''
light
*NL*
lay
,
in
those
days
,
to
my
sense
,
thick
and
rich
upon
the
scene
.
It
was
*NL*
the
light
in
which
so
much
of
the
picture
hung
.
But
that
IS
another
*NL*
matter
.
There
is
really
too
much
to
say
.

THE
PORTRAIT
OF
A
LADY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
Under
certain
circumstances
there
are
few
hours
in
life
more
agreeable
*NL*
than
the
hour
dedicated
to
the
ceremony
known
as
afternoon
tea
.
There
*NL*
are
circumstances
in
which
,
whether
you
partake
of
the
tea
or
not
--
some
*NL*
people
of
course
never
do
,
--
the
situation
is
in
itself
delightful
.
Those
*NL*
that
I
have
in
mind
in
beginning
to
unfold
this
simple
history
offered
*NL*
an
admirable
setting
to
an
innocent
pastime
.
The
implements
of
*NL*
the
little
feast
had
been
disposed
upon
the
lawn
of
an
old
English
*NL*
country-house
,
in
what
I
should
call
the
perfect
middle
of
a
splendid
*NL*
summer
afternoon
.
Part
of
the
afternoon
had
waned
,
but
much
of
it
was
*NL*
left
,
and
what
was
left
was
of
the
finest
and
rarest
quality
.
Real
dusk
*NL*
would
not
arrive
for
many
hours
;
but
the
flood
of
summer
light
had
begun
*NL*
to
ebb
,
the
air
had
grown
mellow
,
the
shadows
were
long
upon
the
smooth
,
*NL*
dense
turf
.
They
lengthened
slowly
,
however
,
and
the
scene
expressed
*NL*
that
sense
of
leisure
still
to
come
which
is
perhaps
the
chief
source
*NL*
of
one
's
enjoyment
of
such
a
scene
at
such
an
hour
.
From
five
o'clock
to
*NL*
eight
is
on
certain
occasions
a
little
eternity
;
but
on
such
an
occasion
*NL*
as
this
the
interval
could
be
only
an
eternity
of
pleasure
.
The
persons
*NL*
concerned
in
it
were
taking
their
pleasure
quietly
,
and
they
were
not
*NL*
of
the
sex
which
is
supposed
to
furnish
the
regular
votaries
of
the
*NL*
ceremony
I
have
mentioned
.
The
shadows
on
the
perfect
lawn
were
straight
*NL*
and
angular
;
they
were
the
shadows
of
an
old
man
sitting
in
a
deep
*NL*
wicker-chair
near
the
low
table
on
which
the
tea
had
been
served
,
and
*NL*
of
two
younger
men
strolling
to
and
fro
,
in
desultory
talk
,
in
front
of
*NL*
him
.
The
old
man
had
his
cup
in
his
hand
;
it
was
an
unusually
large
cup
,
*NL*
of
a
different
pattern
from
the
rest
of
the
set
and
painted
in
brilliant
*NL*
colours
.
He
disposed
of
its
contents
with
much
circumspection
,
holding
*NL*
it
for
a
long
time
close
to
his
chin
,
with
his
face
turned
to
the
house
.
*NL*
His
companions
had
either
finished
their
tea
or
were
indifferent
to
*NL*
their
privilege
;
they
smoked
cigarettes
as
they
continued
to
stroll
.
*NL*
One
of
them
,
from
time
to
time
,
as
he
passed
,
looked
with
a
certain
*NL*
attention
at
the
elder
man
,
who
,
unconscious
of
observation
,
rested
his
*NL*
eyes
upon
the
rich
red
front
of
his
dwelling
.
The
house
that
rose
beyond
*NL*
the
lawn
was
a
structure
to
repay
such
consideration
and
was
the
most
*NL*
characteristic
object
in
the
peculiarly
English
picture
I
have
attempted
*NL*
to
sketch
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
stood
upon
a
low
hill
,
above
the
river
--
the
river
being
the
Thames
at
*NL*
some
forty
miles
from
London
.
A
long
gabled
front
of
red
brick
,
with
*NL*
the
complexion
of
which
time
and
the
weather
had
played
all
sorts
of
*NL*
pictorial
tricks
,
only
,
however
,
to
improve
and
refine
it
,
presented
*NL*
to
the
lawn
its
patches
of
ivy
,
its
clustered
chimneys
,
its
windows
*NL*
smothered
in
creepers
.
The
house
had
a
name
and
a
history
;
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
taking
his
tea
would
have
been
delighted
to
tell
you
these
*NL*
things
:
how
it
had
been
built
under
Edward
the
Sixth
,
had
offered
a
*NL*
night
's
hospitality
to
the
great
Elizabeth
-LRB-
whose
august
person
had
*NL*
extended
itself
upon
a
huge
,
magnificent
and
terribly
angular
bed
which
*NL*
still
formed
the
principal
honour
of
the
sleeping
apartments
-RRB-
,
had
been
*NL*
a
good
deal
bruised
and
defaced
in
Cromwell
's
wars
,
and
then
,
under
the
*NL*
Restoration
,
repaired
and
much
enlarged
;
and
how
,
finally
,
after
having
*NL*
been
remodelled
and
disfigured
in
the
eighteenth
century
,
it
had
passed
*NL*
into
the
careful
keeping
of
a
shrewd
American
banker
,
who
had
bought
it
*NL*
originally
because
-LRB-
owing
to
circumstances
too
complicated
to
set
forth
-RRB-
*NL*
it
was
offered
at
a
great
bargain
:
bought
it
with
much
grumbling
at
its
*NL*
ugliness
,
its
antiquity
,
its
incommodity
,
and
who
now
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
twenty
years
,
had
become
conscious
of
a
real
aesthetic
passion
for
it
,
*NL*
so
that
he
knew
all
its
points
and
would
tell
you
just
where
to
stand
*NL*
to
see
them
in
combination
and
just
the
hour
when
the
shadows
of
*NL*
its
various
protuberances
which
fell
so
softly
upon
the
warm
,
weary
*NL*
brickwork
--
were
of
the
right
measure
.
Besides
this
,
as
I
have
said
,
*NL*
he
could
have
counted
off
most
of
the
successive
owners
and
occupants
,
*NL*
several
of
whom
were
known
to
general
fame
;
doing
so
,
however
,
with
an
*NL*
undemonstrative
conviction
that
the
latest
phase
of
its
destiny
was
not
*NL*
the
least
honourable
.
The
front
of
the
house
overlooking
that
portion
*NL*
of
the
lawn
with
which
we
are
concerned
was
not
the
entrance-front
;
this
*NL*
was
in
quite
another
quarter
.
Privacy
here
reigned
supreme
,
and
the
wide
*NL*
carpet
of
turf
that
covered
the
level
hill-top
seemed
but
the
extension
*NL*
of
a
luxurious
interior
.
The
great
still
oaks
and
beeches
flung
down
a
*NL*
shade
as
dense
as
that
of
velvet
curtains
;
and
the
place
was
furnished
,
*NL*
like
a
room
,
with
cushioned
seats
,
with
rich-coloured
rugs
,
with
*NL*
the
books
and
papers
that
lay
upon
the
grass
.
The
river
was
at
some
*NL*
distance
;
where
the
ground
began
to
slope
the
lawn
,
properly
speaking
,
*NL*
ceased
.
But
it
was
none
the
less
a
charming
walk
down
to
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
at
the
tea-table
,
who
had
come
from
America
thirty
*NL*
years
before
,
had
brought
with
him
,
at
the
top
of
his
baggage
,
his
*NL*
American
physiognomy
;
and
he
had
not
only
brought
it
with
him
,
but
he
*NL*
had
kept
it
in
the
best
order
,
so
that
,
if
necessary
,
he
might
have
*NL*
taken
it
back
to
his
own
country
with
perfect
confidence
.
At
present
,
*NL*
obviously
,
nevertheless
,
he
was
not
likely
to
displace
himself
;
his
*NL*
journeys
were
over
and
he
was
taking
the
rest
that
precedes
the
*NL*
great
rest
.
He
had
a
narrow
,
clean-shaven
face
,
with
features
evenly
*NL*
distributed
and
an
expression
of
placid
acuteness
.
It
was
evidently
a
*NL*
face
in
which
the
range
of
representation
was
not
large
,
so
that
the
air
*NL*
of
contented
shrewdness
was
all
the
more
of
a
merit
.
It
seemed
to
tell
*NL*
that
he
had
been
successful
in
life
,
yet
it
seemed
to
tell
also
that
his
*NL*
success
had
not
been
exclusive
and
invidious
,
but
had
had
much
of
the
*NL*
inoffensiveness
of
failure
.
He
had
certainly
had
a
great
experience
of
*NL*
men
,
but
there
was
an
almost
rustic
simplicity
in
the
faint
smile
that
*NL*
played
upon
his
lean
,
spacious
cheek
and
lighted
up
his
humorous
eye
*NL*
as
he
at
last
slowly
and
carefully
deposited
his
big
tea-cup
upon
the
*NL*
table
.
He
was
neatly
dressed
,
in
well-brushed
black
;
but
a
shawl
was
*NL*
folded
upon
his
knees
,
and
his
feet
were
encased
in
thick
,
embroidered
*NL*
slippers
.
A
beautiful
collie
dog
lay
upon
the
grass
near
his
chair
,
*NL*
watching
the
master
's
face
almost
as
tenderly
as
the
master
took
in
the
*NL*
still
more
magisterial
physiognomy
of
the
house
;
and
a
little
bristling
,
*NL*
bustling
terrier
bestowed
a
desultory
attendance
upon
the
other
*NL*
gentlemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
was
a
remarkably
well-made
man
of
five-and-thirty
,
with
a
*NL*
face
as
English
as
that
of
the
old
gentleman
I
have
just
sketched
was
*NL*
something
else
;
a
noticeably
handsome
face
,
fresh-coloured
,
fair
and
*NL*
frank
,
with
firm
,
straight
features
,
a
lively
grey
eye
and
the
rich
*NL*
adornment
of
a
chestnut
beard
.
This
person
had
a
certain
fortunate
,
*NL*
brilliant
exceptional
look
--
the
air
of
a
happy
temperament
fertilised
by
*NL*
a
high
civilisation
--
which
would
have
made
almost
any
observer
envy
him
*NL*
at
a
venture
.
He
was
booted
and
spurred
,
as
if
he
had
dismounted
from
a
*NL*
long
ride
;
he
wore
a
white
hat
,
which
looked
too
large
for
him
;
he
*NL*
held
his
two
hands
behind
him
,
and
in
one
of
them
--
a
large
,
white
,
*NL*
well-shaped
fist
--
was
crumpled
a
pair
of
soiled
dog-skin
gloves
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
,
measuring
the
length
of
the
lawn
beside
him
,
was
a
person
*NL*
of
quite
a
different
pattern
,
who
,
although
he
might
have
excited
*NL*
grave
curiosity
,
would
not
,
like
the
other
,
have
provoked
you
to
wish
*NL*
yourself
,
almost
blindly
,
in
his
place
.
Tall
,
lean
,
loosely
and
feebly
*NL*
put
together
,
he
had
an
ugly
,
sickly
,
witty
,
charming
face
,
furnished
,
*NL*
but
by
no
means
decorated
,
with
a
straggling
moustache
and
whisker
.
He
*NL*
looked
clever
and
ill
--
a
combination
by
no
means
felicitous
;
and
he
wore
*NL*
a
brown
velvet
jacket
.
He
carried
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
there
*NL*
was
something
in
the
way
he
did
it
that
showed
the
habit
was
inveterate
.
*NL*
His
gait
had
a
shambling
,
wandering
quality
;
he
was
not
very
firm
on
*NL*
his
legs
.
As
I
have
said
,
whenever
he
passed
the
old
man
in
the
chair
he
*NL*
rested
his
eyes
upon
him
;
and
at
this
moment
,
with
their
faces
brought
*NL*
into
relation
,
you
would
easily
have
seen
they
were
father
and
son
.
*NL*
The
father
caught
his
son
's
eye
at
last
and
gave
him
a
mild
,
responsive
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
getting
on
very
well
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
drunk
your
tea
?
''
asked
the
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
enjoyed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
give
you
some
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
considered
,
placidly
.
``
Well
,
I
guess
I
'll
wait
and
see
.
''
He
*NL*
had
,
in
speaking
,
the
American
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
cold
?
''
the
son
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
slowly
rubbed
his
legs
.
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
I
ca
n't
tell

I
feel

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
some
one
might
feel
for
you
,
''
said
the
younger
man
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
hope
some
one
will
always
feel
for
me
!
Do
n't
you
feel
for
me
,
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
immensely
,
''
said
the
gentleman
addressed
as
Lord
Warburton
,
*NL*
promptly
.
``
I
'm
bound
to
say
you
look
wonderfully
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
suppose
I
am
,
in
most
respects
.
''
And
the
old
man
looked
down
at
*NL*
his
green
shawl
and
smoothed
it
over
his
knees
.
``
The
fact
is
I
've
been
*NL*
comfortable
so
many
years
that
I
suppose
I
've
got
so
used
to
it
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
the
bore
of
comfort
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
.
``
We
only
know
*NL*
when
we
're
uncomfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
strikes
me
we
're
rather
particular
,
''
his
companion
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
there
's
no
doubt
we
're
particular
,
''
Lord
Warburton
murmured
.
*NL*
And
then
the
three
men
remained
silent
a
while
;
the
two
younger
ones
*NL*
standing
looking
down
at
the
other
,
who
presently
asked
for
more
tea
.
``
I
*NL*
should
think
you
would
be
very
unhappy
with
that
shawl
,
''
Lord
Warburton
*NL*
resumed
while
his
companion
filled
the
old
man
's
cup
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
he
must
have
the
shawl
!
''
cried
the
gentleman
in
the
velvet
coat
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
put
such
ideas
as
that
into
his
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
belongs
to
my
wife
,
''
said
the
old
man
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
it
's
for
sentimental
reasons

''
And
Lord
Warburton
made
a
*NL*
gesture
of
apology
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
must
give
it
to
her
when
she
comes

the
old
man
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
please

do
nothing

legs

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you

his

giving
him
*NL*
his
tea

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

lame
ducks

*NL*

Well

it

hot

*NL*
``
Ah

the

kindly
.

good

clumsy

asked
his

*NL*
*NL*
``

his

asked

*NL*
Lord

considered
a
moment
.

Yes

in

Persian

Gulf

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

daddy
replied

serenely

Lord

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

said
Lord

*NL*
*NL*

asked
the

gravely

*NL*

cynic

He
does

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
another

said
the
person
accused
of
cynicism

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
because
his
health
is
so
poor

his
father
explained
to
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
.
``
It
affects
his
mind
and
colours
his

looking

things

he
seems
to
feel
as

had
never
had
a
chance

But
it
's
*NL*
almost
entirely
theoretical
,
you
know
;
it
does
n't
seem
to
affect
his

spirits

I
've
hardly
ever
seen
him

cheerful

about

He
often
cheers
me
up

*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
so
described
looked
at
Lord
Warburton
and
laughed
.
``
Is
it
*NL*
a
glowing
eulogy

an
accusation

levity

Should
you
like
me
to
carry

out
my
theories

*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove

we
should
see
some
queer
things

cried
Lord
Warburton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
have
n't
taken
up
that
sort
of
tone
,

said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Warburton
's
tone
is
worse
than
mine

he
pretends

be
bored

I

not
*NL*
in

least
bored
;
I
find
life
only
too
interesting

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

interesting

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
never
bored

I
come
here

said
Lord

gets
such
*NL*
uncommonly
good
talk

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
another

of
joke

asked
the
old
man

``
You
've
no
excuse
for
*NL*
being
bored
anywhere

When
I
was
your
age
I
had
never
heard
of
such
a
*NL*
thing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
developed
very
late

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
developed
very
quick
;
that
was
just
the
reason

When
I
was
twenty
*NL*
years

I
was
very
highly
developed
indeed

I
was
working
tooth
and
*NL*
nail
.
You
would
n't
be
bored
if
you
had
something
to
do
;
but
all
you
*NL*
young
men
are
too
idle
.
You
think
too
much
of
your
pleasure

You
're
too
*NL*
fastidious

too
indolent

too
rich

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
say
,

cried
Lord
Warburton
,
``
you
're
hardly
the
person
to
accuse
a
*NL*
fellow-creature
of
being
too
rich
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
because
I
'm
a
banker

asked
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
of
that
,
if
you
like

because
you
have

such
*NL*
unlimited
means

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is

very
rich

the
other
young

mercifully
pleaded
.
``
He
has
*NL*
given
away
an
immense
deal
of
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
suppose
it
was
his
own
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
;
``
and
in
that
case
*NL*
could
there
be
a
better
proof
of
wealth

Let
not

talk

*NL*
*NL*
``
Daddy

*NL*
The

shook
his
head
.
``
I
do

pretend
to
have
contributed

anything

the
amusement

*NL*
``
My

*NL*

a

*NL*

nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortunately
there
are

the
ugly

remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it

I
believe
things
are
getting
more
serious

You

young

will
find
that
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
increasing
seriousness
of

that
's
the
great
opportunity
*NL*
of
jokes

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
have
to
be
grim
jokes

said
the

I

convinced
there
*NL*
will
be
great
changes

not
all
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
agree

That

why
I
find
so
much
difficulty

applying
your

you
know
you
told
me
the
other

that
I
ought
to

take
hold

of
*NL*
something

One
hesitates
to
take
hold
of
a
thing
that
may
the
next
*NL*
moment
be
knocked
sky-high
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought

take
hold

said
his
companion
.
``
He
's
*NL*
trying
hard

he
added
,
by
way
of
explanation

to
his
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pretty
women
themselves
may
be
sent
flying

Lord
Warburton
*NL*
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no

they
'll
be
firm

the
old
man
rejoined
;
``
they
'll
not
be
*NL*
affected
by
the
social
and
political
changes
I
just
referred
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
they

Very
well

then

I
'll
lay
hands

one
as
soon

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

the

*NL*
*NL*
A
momentary
silence
marked
perhaps
on
the
part
of
his
auditors
a
sense
*NL*
of
the
magnanimity
of
this
speech
,
for
it
was
a
secret
neither
for
his
*NL*
son
nor
for
his
visitor
that
his
own
experiment
in
matrimony
had
not
*NL*
been
a
happy
one
.
As
he
said
,
however
,
he
made
a
difference
;
and
these
*NL*
words
may
have
been
intended
as
a
confession
of
personal
error
;
though
*NL*
of
course
it
was
not
in
place
for
either
of
his
companions
to
remark
*NL*
that
apparently
the
lady
of
his
choice
had
not
been
one
of
the
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
marry
an
interesting

shall
be
interested

that
what

Lord
Warburton
asked
.
``
I
'm
not
at
all
keen
about

your

son
misrepresented
me

there
's
no

what
an
interesting

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

``

*NL*
*NL*
His
son
broke
into
a
laugh

mean
that

provocation

My

father

've
lived
with

English
for
thirty
years

*NL*
you
've
picked
up
a

many
of
the
things
they

*NL*
*NL*
``

returned
with
all
his
serenity

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
the
honour

Lord
Warburton
said
.
``
I
*NL*
think
it

heard

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
niece

Mrs.
Touchett

*NL*
*NL*
Then
young
Mr.
Touchett
explained
.
``
My

you
know

has
been
*NL*
spending
the
winter
in
America

we
're

back

She
writes
*NL*
that
she
has
discovered
a
niece
and
that
she
has
invited
her
to
come
out
*NL*
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,

very
kind
of
her

Lord

Is
the
young
lady
*NL*
interesting

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
hardly
know
more
about

you

my
mother
has
not
gone
into

details

She
chiefly
communicates
with
us
by
means
of
telegrams
,
and
her
*NL*
telegrams
are
rather
inscrutable
.
They
say
women
do
n't
know
how
to
write
*NL*
them

my
mother
has
thoroughly
mastered

the
sort
of
message
we
get
from
her

that

was
the
last
that
came

there
had
been
another
before

,
go
to
*NL*
Europe
,
two
sisters
,
quite
independent
.
'
Over
that
my
father
and
I
*NL*
have
scarcely
stopped
puzzling
;
it
seems
to
admit
of
so
many
*NL*
interpretations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
thing
very
clear
in
it
,
''
said
the
old
man
;
``
she
has
given
*NL*
the
hotel-clerk
a
dressing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
even
of
that
,
since
he
has
driven
her
from
the
field
.
We
*NL*
thought
at
first
that
the
sister
mentioned
might
be
the
sister
of
the
*NL*
clerk
;
but
the
subsequent
mention
of
a
niece
seems
to
prove
that
the
*NL*
allusion
is
to
one
of
my
aunts
.
Then
there
was
a
question
as
to
whose
*NL*
the
two
other
sisters
were
;
they
are
probably
two
of
my
late
aunt
's
*NL*
daughters
.
But
who
's
`
quite
independent
,
'
and
in
what
sense
is
the
term
*NL*
used
?
--
that
point
's
not
yet
settled
.
Does
the
expression
apply
more
*NL*
particularly
to
the
young
lady
my
mother
has
adopted
,
or
does
it
*NL*
characterise
her
sisters
equally
?
--
and
is
it
used
in
a
moral
or
in
a
*NL*
financial
sense
?
Does
it
mean
that
they
've
been
left
well
off
,
or
*NL*
that
they
wish
to
be
under
no
obligations
?
or
does
it
simply
mean
that
*NL*
they
're
fond
of
their
own
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
else
it
means
,
it
's
pretty
sure
to
mean
that
,
''
Mr.
Touchett
*NL*
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
see
for
yourself
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
.
``
When
does
Mrs.
Touchett
*NL*
arrive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
quite
in
the
dark
;
as
soon
as
she
can
find
a
decent
cabin
.
*NL*
She
may
be
waiting
for
it
yet
;
on
the
other
hand
she
may
already
have
*NL*
disembarked
in
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
she
would
probably
have
telegraphed
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
telegraphs
when
you
would
expect
it
--
only
when
you
do
n't
,
''
*NL*
said
the
old
man
.
``
She
likes
to
drop
on
me
suddenly
;
she
thinks
she
'll
*NL*
find
me
doing
something
wrong
.
She
has
never
done
so
yet
,
but
she
's
not
*NL*
discouraged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
her
share
in
the
family
trait
,
the
independence
she
speaks
of
.
''
*NL*
Her
son
's
appreciation
of
the
matter
was
more
favourable
.
``
Whatever
the
*NL*
high
spirit
of
those
young
ladies
may
be
,
her
own
is
a
match
for
it
.
She
*NL*
likes
to
do
everything
for
herself
and
has
no
belief
in
any
one
's
power
*NL*
to
help
her
.
She
thinks
me
of
no
more
use
than
a
postage-stamp
without
*NL*
gum
,
and
she
would
never
forgive
me
if
I
should
presume
to
go
to
*NL*
Liverpool
to
meet
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
at
least
let
me
know
when
your
cousin
arrives
?
''
Lord
Warburton
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
on
the
condition
I
've
mentioned
--
that
you
do
n't
fall
in
love
with
*NL*
her
!
''
Mr.
Touchett
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
strikes
me
as
hard
,
do
n't
you
think
me
good
enough
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
too
good
--
because
I
should
n't
like
her
to
marry
you
.
She
*NL*
has
n't
come
here
to
look
for
a
husband
,
I
hope
;
so
many
young
ladies
are
*NL*
doing
that
,
as
if
there
were
no
good
ones
at
home
.
Then
she
's
probably
*NL*
engaged
;
American
girls
are
usually
engaged
,
I
believe
.
Moreover
I
'm
not
*NL*
sure
,
after
all
,
that
you
'd
be
a
remarkable
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
she
's
engaged
;
I
've
known
a
good
many
American
girls
,
and
*NL*
they
always
were
;
but
I
could
never
see
that
it
made
any
difference
,
*NL*
upon
my
word
!
As
for
my
being
a
good
husband
,
''
Mr.
Touchett
's
visitor
*NL*
pursued
,
``
I
'm
not
sure
of
that
either
.
One
can
but
try
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
as
much
as
you
please
,
but
do
n't
try
on
my
niece
,
''
smiled
the
old
*NL*
man
,
whose
opposition
to
the
idea
was
broadly
humorous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
with
a
humour
broader
still
,
``
perhaps
,
*NL*
after
all
,
she
's
not
worth
trying
on
!

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
exchange
of
pleasantries
took
place
between
the
two
Ralph
*NL*
Touchett
wandered
away
a
little
,
with
his
usual
slouching
gait
,
his
*NL*
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
little
rowdyish
terrier
at
his
heels
.
His
*NL*
face
was
turned
toward
the
house
,
but
his
eyes
were
bent
musingly
on
the
*NL*
lawn
;
so
that
he
had
been
an
object
of
observation
to
a
person
who
had
*NL*
just
made
her
appearance
in
the
ample
doorway
for
some
moments
before
*NL*
he
perceived
her
.
His
attention
was
called
to
her
by
the
conduct
of
*NL*
his
dog
,
who
had
suddenly
darted
forward
with
a
little
volley
of
shrill
*NL*
barks
,
in
which
the
note
of
welcome
,
however
,
was
more
sensible
than
*NL*
that
of
defiance
.
The
person
in
question
was
a
young
lady
,
who
seemed
*NL*
immediately
to
interpret
the
greeting
of
the
small
beast
.
He
advanced
*NL*
with
great
rapidity
and
stood
at
her
feet
,
looking
up
and
barking
hard
;
*NL*
whereupon
,
without
hesitation
,
she
stooped
and
caught
him
in
her
hands
,
*NL*
holding
him
face
to
face
while
he
continued
his
quick
chatter
.
His
*NL*
master
now
had
had
time
to
follow
and
to
see
that
Bunchie
's
new
friend
*NL*
was
a
tall
girl
in
a
black
dress
,
who
at
first
sight
looked
pretty
.
*NL*
She
was
bareheaded
,
as
if
she
were
staying
in
the
house
--
a
fact
which
*NL*
conveyed
perplexity
to
the
son
of
its
master
,
conscious
of
that
immunity
*NL*
from
visitors
which
had
for
some
time
been
rendered
necessary
by
the
*NL*
latter
's
ill-health
.
Meantime
the
two
other
gentlemen
had
also
taken
*NL*
note
of
the
new-comer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
who
's
that
strange
woman
?
''
Mr.
Touchett
had
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
's
Mrs.
Touchett
's
niece
--
the
independent
young
lady
,
''
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
suggested
.
``
I
think
she
must
be
,
from
the
way
she
handles
the
*NL*
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
collie
,
too
,
had
now
allowed
his
attention
to
be
diverted
,
and
he
*NL*
trotted
toward
the
young
lady
in
the
doorway
,
slowly
setting
his
tail
in
*NL*
motion
as
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
's
my
wife
then
?
''
murmured
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
the
young
lady
has
left
her
somewhere
:
that
's
a
part
of
the
*NL*
independence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
spoke
to
Ralph
,
smiling
,
while
she
still
held
up
the
terrier
.
*NL*
``
Is
this
your
little
dog
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
mine
a
moment
ago
;
but
you
've
suddenly
acquired
a
remarkable
air
*NL*
of
property
in
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
we
share
him
?
''
asked
the
girl
.
``
He
's
such
a
perfect
little
*NL*
darling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
looked
at
her
a
moment
;
she
was
unexpectedly
pretty
.
``
You
may
have
*NL*
him
altogether
,
''
he
then
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
seemed
to
have
a
great
deal
of
confidence
,
both
in
*NL*
herself
and
in
others
;
but
this
abrupt
generosity
made
her
blush
.
``
I
*NL*
ought
to
tell
you
that
I
'm
probably
your
cousin
,
''
she
brought
out
,
*NL*
putting
down
the
dog
.
``
And
here
's
another
!
''
she
added
quickly
,
as
the
*NL*
collie
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
?
''
the
young
man
exclaimed
,
laughing
.
``
I
supposed
it
was
quite
*NL*
settled
!
Have
you
arrived
with
my
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
half
an
hour
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
has
she
deposited
you
and
departed
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
went
straight
to
her
room
,
and
she
told
me
that
,
if
I
should
*NL*
see
you
,
I
was
to
say
to
you
that
you
must
come
to
her
there
at
a
*NL*
quarter
to
seven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
looked
at
his
watch
.
``
Thank
you
very
much
;
I
shall
be
*NL*
punctual
.
''
And
then
he
looked
at
his
cousin
.
``
You
're
very
welcome
here
.
*NL*
I
'm
delighted
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
looking
at
everything
,
with
an
eye
that
denoted
clear
*NL*
perception
--
at
her
companion
,
at
the
two
dogs
,
at
the
two
gentlemen
*NL*
under
the
trees
,
at
the
beautiful
scene
that
surrounded
her
.
``
I
've
never
*NL*
seen
anything
so
lovely
as
this
place
.
I
've
been
all
over
the
house
;
*NL*
it
's
too
enchanting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
you
should
have
been
here
so
long
without
our
knowing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
told
me
that
in
England
people
arrived
very
quietly
;
so
I
*NL*
thought
it
was
all
right
.
Is
one
of
those
gentlemen
your
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
elder
one
--
the
one
sitting
down
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
gave
a
laugh
.
``
I
do
n't
suppose
it
's
the
other
.
Who
's
the
*NL*
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
friend
of
ours
--
Lord
Warburton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
hoped
there
would
be
a
lord
;
it
's
just
like
a
novel
!
''
And
then
,
*NL*
``
Oh
you
adorable
creature
!
''
she
suddenly
cried
,
stooping
down
and
*NL*
picking
up
the
small
dog
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
standing
where
they
had
met
,
making
no
offer
to
advance
or
*NL*
to
speak
to
Mr.
Touchett
,
and
while
she
lingered
so
near
the
threshold
,
*NL*
slim
and
charming
,
her
interlocutor
wondered
if
she
expected
the
old
man
*NL*
to
come
and
pay
her
his
respects
.
American
girls
were
used
to
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
deference
,
and
it
had
been
intimated
that
this
one
had
a
high
*NL*
spirit
.
Indeed
Ralph
could
see
that
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
and
make
acquaintance
with
my
father
?
''
he
nevertheless
*NL*
ventured
to
ask
.
``
He
's
old
and
infirm
--
he
does
n't
leave
his
chair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
poor
man
,
I
'm
very
sorry
!
''
the
girl
exclaimed
,
immediately
moving
*NL*
forward
.
``
I
got
the
impression
from
your
mother
that
he
was
rather
*NL*
intensely
active
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
Touchett
was
silent
a
moment
.
``
She
has
n't
seen
him
for
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
has
a
lovely
place
to
sit
.
Come
along
,
little
hound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
dear
old
place
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
looking
sidewise
at
his
*NL*
neighbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
his
name
?
''
she
asked
,
her
attention
having
again
reverted
to
the
*NL*
terrier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
's
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
young
lady
with
amusement
;
``
but
do
n't
tell
him
I
asked
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
come
by
this
time
to
where
old
Mr.
Touchett
was
sitting
,
and
he
*NL*
slowly
got
up
from
his
chair
to
introduce
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
has
arrived
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
and
this
is
Miss
Archer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
placed
his
two
hands
on
her
shoulders
,
looked
at
her
a
*NL*
moment
with
extreme
benevolence
and
then
gallantly
kissed
her
.
``
It
's
*NL*
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
see
you
here
;
but
I
wish
you
had
given
us
a
*NL*
chance
to
receive
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
were
received
,
''
said
the
girl
.
``
There
were
about
a
dozen
*NL*
servants
in
the
hall
.
And
there
was
an
old
woman
curtseying
at
the
*NL*
gate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
do
better
than
that

if
we
have
notice
!

And
the
old
man
stood
*NL*
there
smiling
,
rubbing
his
hands
and
slowly
shaking
his
head
at
her
.
*NL*
``
But
Mrs.
Touchett
does
n't
like
receptions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
went
straight
to
her
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
and
locked
herself
in
.
She
always
does
that

Well
,
I
suppose
I
*NL*
shall
see
her
next
week
.
''
And
Mrs.
Touchett
's
husband
slowly
resumed
his
*NL*
former
posture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
that
,

said
Miss
Archer
.
``
She
's
coming
down
to
dinner

at
eight
*NL*
o'clock

Do
n't
you
forget
a
quarter
to
seven

she
added
,
turning
with
a
*NL*
smile
to
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
to
happen
at
a
quarter
to
seven

*NL*
*NL*

Ralph

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

the
old
man
commented
.
``
You
must
sit
down
--
you
must
*NL*
have
some
tea

he
observed
to
his
wife
's
niece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
gave
me
some
tea
in
my
room
the
moment
I
got
there

this
young
*NL*
lady
answered
.
``
I
'm
sorry
you
're
out
of
health

she
added
,
resting
her
*NL*
eyes
upon
her
venerable
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
'm
an
old
man

I
shall
be
*NL*
the
better
for
having
you
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
looking
all
round
her
again
--
at
the
lawn
,
the
great
trees
,
*NL*
the
reedy
,
silvery
Thames
,
the
beautiful
old
house
;
and
while
engaged
*NL*
in
this
survey
she
had
made
room
in
it
for
her
companions
;
a
*NL*
comprehensiveness
of
observation
easily
conceivable
on
the
part
of
a
*NL*
young
woman
who
was
evidently
both
intelligent
and
excited
.
She
had
*NL*
seated
herself
and
had
put
away
the
little
dog
;
her
white
hands
,
in
*NL*
her
lap
,
were
folded
upon
her
black
dress
;
her
head
was
erect
,
her
eye
*NL*
lighted
,
her
flexible
figure
turned
itself
easily
this
way
and
that
,
in
*NL*
sympathy
with
the
alertness
with
which
she
evidently
caught
impressions
.
*NL*
Her
impressions
were
numerous
,
and
they
were
all
reflected
in
a
clear
,
*NL*
still
smile
.
``
I
've
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
as
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
looking
very
well
,
''
said
Mr.
Touchett
.
``
I
know
the
way
it
strikes
*NL*
you
.
I
've
been
through
all
that
.
But
you
're
very
beautiful
yourself
,
''
he
*NL*
added
with
a
politeness
by
no
means
crudely
jocular
and
with
the
happy
*NL*
consciousness
that
his
advanced
age
gave
him
the
privilege
of
saying
*NL*
such
things
--
even
to
young
persons
who
might
possibly
take
alarm
at
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
degree
of
alarm
this
young
person
took
need
not
be
exactly
*NL*
measured
;
she
instantly
rose
,
however
,
with
a
blush
which
was
not
a
*NL*
refutation
.
``
Oh
yes
,
of
course
I
'm
lovely
!
''
she
returned
with
a
quick
*NL*
laugh
.
``
How
old
is
your
house
?
Is
it
Elizabethan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
early
Tudor
,
''
said
Ralph
Touchett
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
toward
him
,
watching
his
face
.
``
Early
Tudor
?
How
very
*NL*
delightful
!
And
I
suppose
there
are
a
great
many
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
many
much
better
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
that
,
my
son
!
''
the
old
man
protested
.
``
There
's
nothing
better
*NL*
than
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
a
very
good
one
;
I
think
in
some
respects
it
's
rather
better
,
''
*NL*
said
Lord
Warburton
,
who
as
yet
had
not
spoken
,
but
who
had
kept
an
*NL*
attentive
eye
upon
Miss
Archer
.
He
slightly
inclined
himself
,
smiling
;
*NL*
he
had
an
excellent
manner
with
women
.
The
girl
appreciated
it
in
an
*NL*
instant
;
she
had
not
forgotten
that
this
was
Lord
Warburton
.
``
I
should
*NL*
like
very
much
to
show
it
to
you
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
believe
him
,
''
cried
the
old
man
;
``
do
n't
look
at
it
!
It
's
a
*NL*
wretched
old
barrack
--
not
to
be
compared
with
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
I
ca
n't
judge
,
''
said
the
girl
,
smiling
at
Lord
Warburton
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
discussion
Ralph
Touchett
took
no
interest
whatever
;
he
stood
*NL*
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
looking
greatly
as
if
he
should
like
to
*NL*
renew
his
conversation
with
his
new-found
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
very
fond
of
dogs
?
''
he
enquired
by
way
of
beginning
.
He
seemed
*NL*
to
recognise
that
it
was
an
awkward
beginning
for
a
clever
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
fond
of
them
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
keep
the
terrier
,
you
know
,
''
he
went
on
,
still
awkwardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
keep
him
while
I
'm
here
,
with
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
be
for
a
long
time
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
kind
.
I
hardly
know
.
My
aunt
must
settle
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
settle
it
with
her
--
at
a
quarter
to
seven
.
''
And
Ralph
looked
at
*NL*
his
watch
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
to
be
here
at
all
,
''
said
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
you
allow
things
to
be
settled
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
;
if
they
're
settled
as
I
like
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
settle
this
as
I
like
it
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
It
's
most
unaccountable
*NL*
that
we
should
never
have
known
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
there
--
you
had
only
to
come
and
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
?
Where
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
United
States
:
in
New
York
and
Albany
and
other
American
*NL*
places
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
there
--
all
over
,
but
I
never
saw
you
.
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Archer
just
hesitated
.
``
It
was
because
there
had
been
some
*NL*
disagreement
between
your
mother
and
my
father
,
after
my
mother
's
death
,
*NL*
which
took
place
when
I
was
a
child
.
In
consequence
of
it
we
never
*NL*
expected
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
I
do
n't
embrace
all
my
mother
's
quarrels
--
heaven
forbid
!
''
*NL*
the
young
man
cried
.
``
You
've
lately
lost
your
father
?
''
he
went
on
more
*NL*
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
more
than
a
year
ago
.
After
that
my
aunt
was
very
kind
to
me
;
she
*NL*
came
to
see
me
and
proposed
that
I
should
come
with
her
to
Europe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
She
has
adopted
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adopted
me
?
''
The
girl
stared
,
and
her
blush
came
back
to
her
,
together
*NL*
with
a
momentary
look
of
pain
which
gave
her
interlocutor
some
alarm
.
He
*NL*
had
underestimated
the
effect
of
his
words
.
Lord
Warburton
,
who
appeared
*NL*
constantly
desirous
of
a
nearer
view
of
Miss
Archer
,
strolled
toward
the
*NL*
two
cousins
at
the
moment
,
and
as
he
did
so
she
rested
her
wider
eyes
on
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
;
she
has
not
adopted
me
.
I
'm
not
a
candidate
for
adoption
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
a
thousand
pardons
,
''
Ralph
murmured
.
``
I
meant
--
I
meant
--
''
He
*NL*
hardly
knew
what
he
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
meant
she
has
taken
me
up
.
Yes
;
she
likes
to
take
people
up
.
*NL*
She
has
been
very
kind
to
me
;
but
,
''
she
added
with
a
certain
visible
*NL*
eagerness
of
desire
to
be
explicit
,
``
I
'm
very
fond
of
my
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
talking
about
Mrs.
Touchett
?
''
the
old
man
called
out
from
his
*NL*
chair
.
``
Come
here
,
my
dear
,
and
tell
me
about
her
.
I
'm
always
thankful
*NL*
for
information
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
hesitated
again
,
smiling
.
``
She
's
really
very
benevolent
,
''
*NL*
she
answered
;
after
which
she
went
over
to
her
uncle
,
whose
mirth
was
*NL*
excited
by
her
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
was
left
standing
with
Ralph
Touchett
,
to
whom
in
a
*NL*
moment
he
said
:
``
You
wished
a
while
ago
to
see
my
idea
of
an
interesting
*NL*
woman
.
There
it
is
!
''

*NL*
CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
was
certainly
a
person
of
many
oddities
,
of
which
her
*NL*
behaviour
on
returning
to
her
husband
's
house
after
many
months
was
a
*NL*
noticeable
specimen
.
She
had
her
own
way
of
doing
all
that
she
did
,
and
*NL*
this
is
the
simplest
description
of
a
character
which
,
although
by
no
*NL*
means
without
liberal
motions
,
rarely
succeeded
in
giving
an
impression
*NL*
of
suavity
.
Mrs.
Touchett
might
do
a
great
deal
of
good
,
but
she
*NL*
never
pleased
.
This
way
of
her
own
,
of
which
she
was
so
fond
,
was
not
*NL*
intrinsically
offensive
--
it
was
just
unmistakeably
distinguished
from
*NL*
the
ways
of
others
.
The
edges
of
her
conduct
were
so
very
clear-cut
that
*NL*
for
susceptible
persons
it
sometimes
had
a
knife-like
effect
.
That
hard
*NL*
fineness
came
out
in
her
deportment
during
the
first
hours
of
her
return
*NL*
from
America
,
under
circumstances
in
which
it
might
have
seemed
that
*NL*
her
first
act
would
have
been
to
exchange
greetings
with
her
husband
*NL*
and
son
.
Mrs.
Touchett
,
for
reasons
which
she
deemed
excellent
,
always
*NL*
retired
on
such
occasions
into
impenetrable
seclusion
,
postponing
the
*NL*
more
sentimental
ceremony
until
she
had
repaired
the
disorder
of
dress
*NL*
with
a
completeness
which
had
the
less
reason
to
be
of
high
importance
*NL*
as
neither
beauty
nor
vanity
were
concerned
in
it
.
She
was
a
plain-faced
*NL*
old
woman
,
without
graces
and
without
any
great
elegance
,
but
with
an
*NL*
extreme
respect
for
her
own
motives
.
She
was
usually
prepared
to
explain
*NL*
these
--
when
the
explanation
was
asked
as
a
favour
;
and
in
such
a
case
*NL*
they
proved
totally
different
from
those
that
had
been
attributed
to
*NL*
her
.
She
was
virtually
separated
from
her
husband
,
but
she
appeared
to
*NL*
perceive
nothing
irregular
in
the
situation
.
It
had
become
clear
,
at
an
*NL*
early
stage
of
their
community
,
that
they
should
never
desire
the
same
*NL*
thing
at
the
same
moment
,
and
this
appearance
had
prompted
her
to
rescue
*NL*
disagreement
from
the
vulgar
realm
of
accident
.
She
did
what
she
could
*NL*
to
erect
it
into
a
law
--
a
much
more
edifying
aspect
of
it
--
by
going
to
*NL*
live
in
Florence
,
where
she
bought
a
house
and
established
herself
;
and
*NL*
by
leaving
her
husband
to
take
care
of
the
English
branch
of
his
bank
.
*NL*
This
arrangement
greatly
pleased
her
;
it
was
so
felicitously
definite
.
*NL*
It
struck
her
husband
in
the
same
light
,
in
a
foggy
square
in
London
,
*NL*
where
it
was
at
times
the
most
definite
fact
he
discerned
;
but
he
*NL*
would
have
preferred
that
such
unnatural
things
should
have
a
greater
*NL*
vagueness
.
To
agree
to
disagree
had
cost
him
an
effort
;
he
was
ready
to
*NL*
agree
to
almost
anything
but
that
,
and
saw
no
reason
why
either
assent
*NL*
or
dissent
should
be
so
terribly
consistent
.
Mrs.
Touchett
indulged
in
*NL*
no
regrets
nor
speculations
,
and
usually
came
once
a
year
to
spend
a
*NL*
month
with
her
husband
,
a
period
during
which
she
apparently
took
pains
*NL*
to
convince
him
that
she
had
adopted
the
right
system
.
She
was
not
fond
*NL*
of
the
English
style
of
life
,
and
had
three
or
four
reasons
for
it
to
*NL*
which
she
currently
alluded
;
they
bore
upon
minor
points
of
that
ancient
*NL*
order
,
but
for
Mrs.
Touchett
they
amply
justified
non-residence
.
She
*NL*
detested
bread-sauce
,
which
,
as
she
said
,
looked
like
a
poultice
*NL*
and
tasted
like
soap
;
she
objected
to
the
consumption
of
beer
by
*NL*
her
maid-servants
;
and
she
affirmed
that
the
British
laundress
-LRB-
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
was
very
particular
about
the
appearance
of
her
linen
-RRB-
was
not
*NL*
a
mistress
of
her
art
.
At
fixed
intervals
she
paid
a
visit
to
her
own
*NL*
country
;
but
this
last
had
been
longer
than
any
of
its
predecessors
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
taken
up
her
niece
--
there
was
little
doubt
of
that
.
One
wet
*NL*
afternoon
,
some
four
months
earlier
than
the
occurrence
lately
narrated
,
*NL*
this
young
lady
had
been
seated
alone
with
a
book
.
To
say
she
was
so
*NL*
occupied
is
to
say
that
her
solitude
did
not
press
upon
her
;
for
her
*NL*
love
of
knowledge
had
a
fertilising
quality
and
her
imagination
was
*NL*
strong
.
There
was
at
this
time
,
however
,
a
want
of
fresh
taste
in
*NL*
her
situation
which
the
arrival
of
an
unexpected
visitor
did
much
to
*NL*
correct
.
The
visitor
had
not
been
announced
;
the
girl
heard
her
at
last
*NL*
walking
about
the
adjoining
room
.
It
was
in
an
old
house
at
Albany
,
a
*NL*
large
,
square
,
double
house
,
with
a
notice
of
sale
in
the
windows
of
one
*NL*
of
the
lower
apartments
.
There
were
two
entrances
,
one
of
which
had
*NL*
long
been
out
of
use
but
had
never
been
removed
.
They
were
exactly
*NL*
alike
--
large
white
doors
,
with
an
arched
frame
and
wide
side-lights
,
*NL*
perched
upon
little
``
stoops
''
of
red
stone
,
which
descended
sidewise
*NL*
to
the
brick
pavement
of
the
street
.
The
two
houses
together
formed
a
*NL*
single
dwelling
,
the
party-wall
having
been
removed
and
the
rooms
placed
*NL*
in
communication
.
These
rooms
,
above-stairs
,
were
extremely
numerous
,
*NL*
and
were
painted
all
over
exactly
alike
,
in
a
yellowish
white
which
had
*NL*
grown
sallow
with
time
.
On
the
third
floor
there
was
a
sort
of
arched
*NL*
passage
,
connecting
the
two
sides
of
the
house
,
which
Isabel
and
her
*NL*
sisters
used
in
their
childhood
to
call
the
tunnel
and
which
,
though
it
*NL*
was
short
and
well
lighted
,
always
seemed
to
the
girl
to
be
strange
and
*NL*
lonely
,
especially
on
winter
afternoons
.
She
had
been
in
the
house
,
*NL*
at
different
periods
,
as
a
child
;
in
those
days
her
grandmother
lived
*NL*
there
.
Then
there
had
been
an
absence
of
ten
years
,
followed
by
a
return
*NL*
to
Albany
before
her
father
's
death
.
Her
grandmother
,
old
Mrs.
Archer
,
*NL*
had
exercised
,
chiefly
within
the
limits
of
the
family
,
a
large
*NL*
hospitality
in
the
early
period
,
and
the
little
girls
often
spent
weeks
*NL*
under
her
roof
--
weeks
of
which
Isabel
had
the
happiest
memory
.
The
*NL*
manner
of
life
was
different
from
that
of
her
own
home
--
larger
,
more
*NL*
plentiful
,
practically
more
festal
;
the
discipline
of
the
nursery
was
*NL*
delightfully
vague
and
the
opportunity
of
listening
to
the
conversation
*NL*
of
one
's
elders
-LRB-
which
with
Isabel
was
a
highly-valued
pleasure
-RRB-
almost
*NL*
unbounded
.
There
was
a
constant
coming
and
going
;
her
grandmother
's
*NL*
sons
and
daughters
and
their
children
appeared
to
be
in
the
enjoyment
of
*NL*
standing
invitations
to
arrive
and
remain
,
so
that
the
house
offered
to
*NL*
a
certain
extent
the
appearance
of
a
bustling
provincial
inn
kept
by
a
*NL*
gentle
old
landlady
who
sighed
a
great
deal
and
never
presented
a
bill
.
*NL*
Isabel
of
course
knew
nothing
about
bills
;
but
even
as
a
child
she
*NL*
thought
her
grandmother
's
home
romantic
.
There
was
a
covered
piazza
*NL*
behind
it
,
furnished
with
a
swing
which
was
a
source
of
tremulous
*NL*
interest
;
and
beyond
this
was
a
long
garden
,
sloping
down
to
the
stable
*NL*
and
containing
peach-trees
of
barely
credible
familiarity
.
Isabel
had
*NL*
stayed
with
her
grandmother
at
various
seasons
,
but
somehow
all
her
*NL*
visits
had
a
flavour
of
peaches
.
On
the
other
side
,
across
the
street
,
*NL*
was
an
old
house
that
was
called
the
Dutch
House
--
a
peculiar
structure
*NL*
dating
from
the
earliest
colonial
time
,
composed
of
bricks
that
had
been
*NL*
painted
yellow
,
crowned
with
a
gable
that
was
pointed
out
to
strangers
,
*NL*
defended
by
a
rickety
wooden
paling
and
standing
sidewise
to
the
street
.
*NL*
It
was
occupied
by
a
primary
school
for
children
of
both
sexes
,
kept
*NL*
or
rather
let
go
,
by
a
demonstrative
lady
of
whom
Isabel
's
chief
*NL*
recollection
was
that
her
hair
was
fastened
with
strange
bedroomy
combs
*NL*
at
the
temples
and
that
she
was
the
widow
of
some
one
of
consequence
.
*NL*
The
little
girl
had
been
offered
the
opportunity
of
laying
a
foundation
*NL*
of
knowledge
in
this
establishment
;
but
having
spent
a
single
day
in
it
,
*NL*
she
had
protested
against
its
laws
and
had
been
allowed
to
stay
at
home
,
*NL*
where
,
in
the
September
days
,
when
the
windows
of
the
Dutch
House
*NL*
were
open
,
she
used
to
hear
the
hum
of
childish
voices
repeating
the
*NL*
multiplication
table
--
an
incident
in
which
the
elation
of
liberty
and
*NL*
the
pain
of
exclusion
were
indistinguishably
mingled
.
The
foundation
*NL*
of
her
knowledge
was
really
laid
in
the
idleness
of
her
grandmother
's
*NL*
house
,
where
,
as
most
of
the
other
inmates
were
not
reading
people
,
*NL*
she
had
uncontrolled
use
of
a
library
full
of
books
with
frontispieces
,
*NL*
which
she
used
to
climb
upon
a
chair
to
take
down
.
When
she
had
found
*NL*
one
to
her
taste
--
she
was
guided
in
the
selection
chiefly
by
the
*NL*
frontispiece
--
she
carried
it
into
a
mysterious
apartment
which
lay
*NL*
beyond
the
library
and
which
was
called
,
traditionally
,
no
one
knew
*NL*
why
,
the
office
.
Whose
office
it
had
been
and
at
what
period
it
had
*NL*
flourished
,
she
never
learned
;
it
was
enough
for
her
that
it
contained
*NL*
an
echo
and
a
pleasant
musty
smell
and
that
it
was
a
chamber
of
disgrace
*NL*
for
old
pieces
of
furniture
whose
infirmities
were
not
always
apparent
*NL*
-LRB-
so
that
the
disgrace
seemed
unmerited
and
rendered
them
victims
*NL*
of
injustice
-RRB-
and
with
which
,
in
the
manner
of
children
,
she
had
*NL*
established
relations
almost
human
,
certainly
dramatic
.
There
was
an
old
*NL*
haircloth
sofa
in
especial
,
to
which
she
had
confided
a
hundred
childish
*NL*
sorrows
.
The
place
owed
much
of
its
mysterious
melancholy
to
the
fact
*NL*
that
it
was
properly
entered
from
the
second
door
of
the
house
,
the
*NL*
door
that
had
been
condemned
,
and
that
it
was
secured
by
bolts
which
a
*NL*
particularly
slender
little
girl
found
it
impossible
to
slide
.
She
*NL*
knew
that
this
silent
,
motionless
portal
opened
into
the
street
;
if
the
*NL*
sidelights
had
not
been
filled
with
green
paper
she
might
have
looked
*NL*
out
upon
the
little
brown
stoop
and
the
well-worn
brick
pavement
.
But
*NL*
she
had
no
wish
to
look
out
,
for
this
would
have
interfered
with
her
*NL*
theory
that
there
was
a
strange
,
unseen
place
on
the
other
side
--
a
place
*NL*
which
became
to
the
child
's
imagination
,
according
to
its
different
*NL*
moods
,
a
region
of
delight
or
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
``
office
''
still
that
Isabel
was
sitting
on
that
melancholy
*NL*
afternoon
of
early
spring
which
I
have
just
mentioned
.
At
this
time
*NL*
she
might
have
had
the
whole
house
to
choose
from
,
and
the
room
she
had
*NL*
selected
was
the
most
depressed
of
its
scenes
.
She
had
never
opened
the
*NL*
bolted
door
nor
removed
the
green
paper
-LRB-
renewed
by
other
hands
-RRB-
from
*NL*
its
sidelights
;
she
had
never
assured
herself
that
the
vulgar
street
lay
*NL*
beyond
.
A
crude
,
cold
rain
fell
heavily
;
the
spring-time
was
indeed
an
*NL*
appeal
--
and
it
seemed
a
cynical
,
insincere
appeal
--
to
patience
.
Isabel
,
*NL*
however
,
gave
as
little
heed
as
possible
to
cosmic
treacheries
;
she
kept
*NL*
her
eyes
on
her
book
and
tried
to
fix
her
mind
.
It
had
lately
occurred
*NL*
to
her
that
her
mind
was
a
good
deal
of
a
vagabond
,
and
she
had
spent
*NL*
much
ingenuity
in
training
it
to
a
military
step
and
teaching
it
*NL*
to
advance
,
to
halt
,
to
retreat
,
to
perform
even
more
complicated
*NL*
manoeuvres
,
at
the
word
of
command
.
Just
now
she
had
given
it
marching
*NL*
orders
and
it
had
been
trudging
over
the
sandy
plains
of
a
history
of
*NL*
German
Thought
.
Suddenly
she
became
aware
of
a
step
very
different
from
*NL*
her
own
intellectual
pace
;
she
listened
a
little
and
perceived
that
some
*NL*
one
was
moving
in
the
library
,
which
communicated
with
the
office
.
It
*NL*
struck
her
first
as
the
step
of
a
person
from
whom
she
was
looking
for
a
*NL*
visit
,
then
almost
immediately
announced
itself
as
the
tread
of
a
*NL*
woman
and
a
stranger
--
her
possible
visitor
being
neither
.
It
had
an
*NL*
inquisitive
,
experimental
quality
which
suggested
that
it
would
not
stop
*NL*
short
of
the
threshold
of
the
office
;
and
in
fact
the
doorway
of
this
*NL*
apartment
was
presently
occupied
by
a
lady
who
paused
there
and
looked
*NL*
very
hard
at
our
heroine
.
She
was
a
plain
,
elderly
woman
,
dressed
in
*NL*
a
comprehensive
waterproof
mantle
;
she
had
a
face
with
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
rather
violent
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
began
,
``
is
that
where
you
usually
sit
?
''
She
looked
about
at
*NL*
the
heterogeneous
chairs
and
tables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
when
I
have
visitors
,
''
said
Isabel
,
getting
up
to
receive
the
*NL*
intruder
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
directed
their
course
back
to
the
library
while
the
visitor
*NL*
continued
to
look
about
her
.
``
You
seem
to
have
plenty
of
other
rooms
;
*NL*
they
're
in
rather
better
condition
.
But
everything
's
immensely
worn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
come
to
look
at
the
house
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
``
The
servant
will
*NL*
show
it
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
her
away
;
I
do
n't
want
to
buy
it
.
She
has
probably
gone
to
*NL*
look
for
you
and
is
wandering
about
upstairs
;
she
did
n't
seem
at
all
*NL*
intelligent
.
You
had
better
tell
her
it
's
no
matter
.
''
And
then
,
since
*NL*
the
girl
stood
there
hesitating
and
wondering
,
this
unexpected
critic
*NL*
said
to
her
abruptly
:
``
I
suppose
you
're
one
of
the
daughters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
thought
she
had
very
strange
manners
.
``
It
depends
upon
whose
*NL*
daughters
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
late
Mr.
Archer
's
--
and
my
poor
sister
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Isabel
slowly
,
``
you
must
be
our
crazy
Aunt
Lydia
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
your
father
told
you
to
call
me
?
I
'm
your
Aunt
Lydia
,
but
*NL*
I
'm
not
at
all
crazy
:
I
have
n't
a
delusion
!
And
which
of
the
daughters
*NL*
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
the
youngest
of
the
three
,
and
my
name
's
Isabel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
the
others
are
Lilian
and
Edith
.
And
are
you
the
prettiest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
,
''
said
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
must
be
.
''
And
in
this
way
the
aunt
and
the
niece
made
*NL*
friends
.
The
aunt
had
quarrelled
years
before
with
her
brother-in-law
,
*NL*
after
the
death
of
her
sister
,
taking
him
to
task
for
the
manner
in
*NL*
which
he
brought
up
his
three
girls
.
Being
a
high-tempered
man
he
had
*NL*
requested
her
to
mind
her
own
business
,
and
she
had
taken
him
at
his
*NL*
word
.
For
many
years
she
held
no
communication
with
him
and
after
his
*NL*
death
had
addressed
not
a
word
to
his
daughters
,
who
had
been
bred
in
*NL*
that
disrespectful
view
of
her
which
we
have
just
seen
Isabel
betray
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
's
behaviour
was
,
as
usual
,
perfectly
deliberate
.
She
*NL*
intended
to
go
to
America
to
look
after
her
investments
-LRB-
with
which
her
*NL*
husband
,
in
spite
of
his
great
financial
position
,
had
nothing
to
*NL*
do
-RRB-
and
would
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity
to
enquire
into
the
*NL*
condition
of
her
nieces
.
There
was
no
need
of
writing
,
for
she
should
*NL*
attach
no
importance
to
any
account
of
them
she
should
elicit
by
letter
;
*NL*
she
believed
,
always
,
in
seeing
for
one
's
self
.
Isabel
found
,
however
,
*NL*
that
she
knew
a
good
deal
about
them
,
and
knew
about
the
marriage
of
the
*NL*
two
elder
girls
;
knew
that
their
poor
father
had
left
very
little
money
,
*NL*
but
that
the
house
in
Albany
,
which
had
passed
into
his
hands
,
was
to
*NL*
be
sold
for
their
benefit
;
knew
,
finally
,
that
Edmund
Ludlow
,
*NL*
Lilian
's
husband
,
had
taken
upon
himself
to
attend
to
this
matter
,
in
*NL*
consideration
of
which
the
young
couple
,
who
had
come
to
Albany
during
*NL*
Mr.
Archer
's
illness
,
were
remaining
there
for
the
present
and
,
as
well
*NL*
as
Isabel
herself
,
occupying
the
old
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
money
do
you
expect
for
it
?
''
Mrs.
Touchett
asked
of
her
*NL*
companion
,
who
had
brought
her
to
sit
in
the
front
parlour
,
which
she
*NL*
had
inspected
without
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
,
''
said
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
second
time
you
have
said
that
to
me
,
''
her
aunt
rejoined
.
*NL*
``
And
yet
you
do
n't
look
at
all
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
stupid
;
but
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
the
way
you
were
brought
up
--
as
if
you
were
to
inherit
a
*NL*
million
.
What
have
you
in
point
of
fact
inherited
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
ca
n't
tell
you
.
You
must
ask
Edmund
and
Lilian
;
they
'll
be
*NL*
back
in
half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Florence
we
should
call
it
a
very
bad
house
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
;
*NL*
``
but
here
,
I
dare
say
,
it
will
bring
a
high
price
.
It
ought
to
make
*NL*
a
considerable
sum
for
each
of
you
.
In
addition
to
that
you
must
have
*NL*
something
else
;
it
's
most
extraordinary
your
not
knowing
.
The
position
's
*NL*
of
value
,
and
they
'll
probably
pull
it
down
and
make
a
row
of
shops
.
*NL*
I
wonder
you
do
n't
do
that
yourself
;
you
might
let
the
shops
to
great
*NL*
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
stared
;
the
idea
of
letting
shops
was
new
to
her
.
``
I
hope
they
*NL*
wo
n't
pull
it
down
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
'm
extremely
fond
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
what
makes
you
fond
of
it
;
your
father
died
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
do
n't
dislike
it
for
that
,
''
the
girl
rather
strangely
*NL*
returned
.
``
I
like
places
in
which
things
have
happened
--
even
if
they
're
*NL*
sad
things
.
A
great
many
people
have
died
here
;
the
place
has
been
full
*NL*
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
you
call
being
full
of
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
full
of
experience
--
of
people
's
feelings
and
sorrows
.
And
not
of
*NL*
their
sorrows
only
,
for
I
've
been
very
happy
here
as
a
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
go
to
Florence
if
you
like
houses
in
which
things
have
*NL*
happened
--
especially
deaths
.
I
live
in
an
old
palace
in
which
three
*NL*
people
have
been
murdered
;
three
that
were
known
and
I
do
n't
know
how
*NL*
many
more
besides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
an
old
palace
?
''
Isabel
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
;
a
very
different
affair
from
this
.
This
is
very
*NL*
bourgeois
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
felt
some
emotion
,
for
she
had
always
thought
highly
of
her
*NL*
grandmother
's
house
.
But
the
emotion
was
of
a
kind
which
led
her
to
say
:
*NL*
``
I
should
like
very
much
to
go
to
Florence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
'll
be
very
good
,
and
do
everything
I
tell
you
I
'll
take
*NL*
you
there
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
young
woman
's
emotion
deepened
;
she
flushed
a
little
and
smiled
at
*NL*
her
aunt
in
silence
.
``
Do
everything
you
tell
me
?
I
do
n't
think
I
can
*NL*
promise
that
.

No

you
do

look

You

way

but
it
's
not
for
me
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
to
go
to
Florence
,
''
the
girl
exclaimed
in
a
moment
,
``
I
'd
*NL*
promise
almost
anything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
and
Lilian
were
slow
to
return
,
and
Mrs.
Touchett
had
an
*NL*
hour
's
uninterrupted
talk
with
her
niece
,
who
found
her
a
strange
and
*NL*
interesting
figure
:
a
figure
essentially
--
almost
the
first
she
had
ever
*NL*
met
.
She
was
as
eccentric
as
Isabel
had
always
supposed
;
and
hitherto
,
*NL*
whenever
the
girl
had
heard
people
described
as
eccentric
,
she
had
*NL*
thought
of
them
as
offensive
or
alarming
.
The
term
had
always
suggested
*NL*
to
her
something
grotesque
and
even
sinister
.
But
her
aunt
made
it
a
*NL*
matter
of
high
but
easy
irony
,
or
comedy
,
and
led
her
to
ask
herself
*NL*
if
the
common
tone
,
which
was
all
she
had
known
,
had
ever
been
as
*NL*
interesting
.
No
one
certainly
had
on
any
occasion
so
held
her
as
this
*NL*
little
thin-lipped
,
bright-eyed
,
foreign-looking
woman
,
who
retrieved
an
*NL*
insignificant
appearance
by
a
distinguished
manner
and
,
sitting
there
in
*NL*
a
well-worn
waterproof
,
talked
with
striking
familiarity
of
the
courts
*NL*
of
Europe
.
There
was
nothing
flighty
about
Mrs.
Touchett
,
but
she
*NL*
recognised
no
social
superiors
,
and
,
judging
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
*NL*
in
a
way
that
spoke
of
this
,
enjoyed
the
consciousness
of
making
*NL*
an
impression
on
a
candid
and
susceptible
mind
.
Isabel
at
first
had
*NL*
answered
a
good
many
questions
,
and
it
was
from
her
answers
apparently
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Touchett
derived
a
high
opinion
of
her
intelligence
.
But
after
*NL*
this
she
had
asked
a
good
many
,
and
her
aunt
's
answers
,
whatever
turn
*NL*
they
took
,
struck
her
as
food
for
deep
reflexion
.
Mrs.
Touchett
waited
*NL*
for
the
return
of
her
other
niece
as
long
as
she
thought
reasonable
,
but
*NL*
as
at
six
o'clock
Mrs.
Ludlow
had
not
come
in
she
prepared
to
take
her
*NL*
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sister
must
be
a
great
gossip
.
Is
she
accustomed
to
staying
out
so
*NL*
many
hours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
out
almost
as
long
as
she
,
''
Isabel
replied
;
``
she
can
have
*NL*
left
the
house
but
a
short
time
before
you
came
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
looked
at
the
girl
without
resentment
;
she
appeared
to
*NL*
enjoy
a
bold
retort
and
to
be
disposed
to
be
gracious
.
``
Perhaps
she
*NL*
has
n't
had
so
good
an
excuse
as
I.
Tell
her
at
any
rate
that
she
must
*NL*
come
and
see
me
this
evening
at
that
horrid
hotel
.
She
may
bring
her
*NL*
husband
if
she
likes
,
but
she
need
n't
bring
you
.
I
shall
see
plenty
of
*NL*
you
later

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Ludlow
was
the
eldest
of
the
three
sisters
,
and
was
usually
thought
*NL*
the
most
sensible
;
the
classification
being
in
general
that
Lilian
*NL*
was
the
practical
one
,
Edith
the
beauty
and
Isabel
the
``
intellectual
''
*NL*
superior
.
Mrs.
Keyes
,
the
second
of
the
group
,
was
the
wife
of
an
*NL*
officer
of
the
United
States
Engineers
,
and
as
our
history
is
not
*NL*
further
concerned
with
her
it
will
suffice
that
she
was
indeed
very
*NL*
pretty
and
that
she
formed
the
ornament
of
those
various
military
*NL*
stations
,
chiefly
in
the
unfashionable
West
,
to
which
,
to
her
deep
*NL*
chagrin
,
her
husband
was
successively
relegated
.
Lilian
had
married
a
*NL*
New
York
lawyer
,
a
young
man
with
a
loud
voice
and
an
enthusiasm
for
*NL*
his
profession
;
the
match
was
not
brilliant
,
any
more
than
Edith
's
,
but
*NL*
Lilian
had
occasionally
been
spoken
of
as
a
young
woman
who
might
be
*NL*
thankful
to
marry
at
all
--
she
was
so
much
plainer
than
her
sisters
.
*NL*
She
was
,
however
,
very
happy
,
and
now
,
as
the
mother
of
two
peremptory
*NL*
little
boys
and
the
mistress
of
a
wedge
of
brown
stone
violently
driven
*NL*
into
Fifty-third
Street
,
seemed
to
exult
in
her
condition
as
in
a
bold
*NL*
escape
.
She
was
short
and
solid
,
and
her
claim
to
figure
was
questioned
,
*NL*
but
she
was
conceded
presence
,
though
not
majesty
;
she
had
moreover
,
as
*NL*
people
said
,
improved
since
her
marriage
,
and
the
two
things
in
life
*NL*
of
which
she
was
most
distinctly
conscious
were
her
husband
's
force
in
*NL*
argument
and
her
sister
Isabel
's
originality
.
``
I
've
never
kept
up
with
*NL*
Isabel
--
it
would
have
taken
all
my
time
,
''
she
had
often
remarked
;
*NL*
in
spite
of
which
,
however
,
she
held
her
rather
wistfully
in
sight
;
*NL*
watching
her
as
a
motherly
spaniel
might
watch
a
free
greyhound
.
``
I
want
*NL*
to
see
her
safely
married
--
that
's
what
I
want
to
see
,
''
she
frequently
*NL*
noted
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
say
I
should
have
no
particular
desire
to
marry
her
,
''
*NL*
Edmund
Ludlow
was
accustomed
to
answer
in
an
extremely
audible
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
say
that
for
argument
;
you
always
take
the
opposite
ground
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
see
what
you
've
against
her
except
that
she
's
so
original
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
like
originals
;
I
like
translations
,
''
Mr.
Ludlow
had
more
*NL*
than
once
replied
.
``
Isabel
's
written
in
a
foreign
tongue
.
I
ca
n't
make
*NL*
her
out
.
She
ought
to
marry
an
Armenian
or
a
Portuguese
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
'm
afraid
she
'll
do
!
''
cried
Lilian
,
who
thought
*NL*
Isabel
capable
of
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
listened
with
great
interest
to
the
girl
's
account
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
's
appearance
and
in
the
evening
prepared
to
comply
with
their
*NL*
aunt
's
commands
.
Of
what
Isabel
then
said
no
report
has
remained
,
but
*NL*
her
sister
's
words
had
doubtless
prompted
a
word
spoken
to
her
husband
*NL*
as
the
two
were
making
ready
for
their
visit
.
``
I
do
hope
immensely
*NL*
she
'll
do
something
handsome
for
Isabel
;
she
has
evidently
taken
a
great
*NL*
fancy
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
wish
her
to
do
?
''
Edmund
Ludlow
asked
.
``
Make
her
a
big
*NL*
present
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
indeed
;
nothing
of
the
sort
.
But
take
an
interest
in
her
--
sympathise
*NL*
with
her
.
She
's
evidently
just
the
sort
of
person
to
appreciate
her
.
She
*NL*
has
lived
so
much
in
foreign
society
;
she
told
Isabel
all
about
it
.
You
*NL*
know
you
've
always
thought
Isabel
rather
foreign
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
her
to
give
her
a
little
foreign
sympathy
,
eh
?
Do
n't
you
think
*NL*
she
gets
enough
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
ought
to
go
abroad
,
''
said
Mrs.
Ludlow
.
``
She
's
just
the
person
*NL*
to
go
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
want
the
old
lady
to
take
her
,
is
that
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
offered
to
take
her
--
she
's
dying
to
have
Isabel
go
.
But
what
*NL*
I
want
her
to
do
when
she
gets
her
there
is
to
give
her
all
the
*NL*
advantages
.
I
'm
sure
all
we
've
got
to
do
,
''
said
Mrs.
Ludlow
,
``
is
to
give
*NL*
her
a
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
chance
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
chance
to
develop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Moses
!
''
Edmund
Ludlow
exclaimed
.
``
I
hope
she
is
n't
going
to
develop
*NL*
any
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
not
sure
you
only
said
that
for
argument
I
should
feel
very
*NL*
badly
,
''
his
wife
replied
.
``
But
you
know
you
love
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
I
love
you
?
''
the
young
man
said
,
jocosely
,
to
Isabel
a
*NL*
little
later
,
while
he
brushed
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
care
whether
you
do
or
not
!
''
exclaimed
the
girl
;
whose
*NL*
voice
and
smile
,
however
,
were
less
haughty
than
her
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
feels
so
grand
since
Mrs.
Touchett
's
visit
,
''
said
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Isabel
challenged
this
assertion
with
a
good
deal
of
seriousness
.
*NL*
``
You
must
not
say
that
,
Lily
.
I
do
n't
feel
grand
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
there
's
no
harm
,
''
said
the
conciliatory
Lily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
there
's
nothing
in
Mrs.
Touchett
's
visit
to
make
one
feel
*NL*
grand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
exclaimed
Ludlow
,
``
she
's
grander
than
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
I
feel
grand
,
''
said
the
girl
,
``
it
will
be
for
a
better
*NL*
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
she
felt
grand
or
no
,
she
at
any
rate
felt
different
,
as
if
*NL*
something
had
happened
to
her
.
Left
to
herself
for
the
evening
she
sat
*NL*
a
while
under
the
lamp
,
her
hands
empty
,
her
usual
avocations
unheeded
.
*NL*
Then
she
rose
and
moved
about
the
room
,
and
from
one
room
to
another
,
*NL*
preferring
the
places
where
the
vague
lamplight
expired
.
She
was
*NL*
restless
and
even
agitated
;
at
moments
she
trembled
a
little
.
The
*NL*
importance
of
what
had
happened
was
out
of
proportion
to
its
appearance
;
*NL*
there
had
really
been
a
change
in
her
life
.
What
it
would
bring
with
it
*NL*
was
as
yet
extremely
indefinite
;
but
Isabel
was
in
a
situation
that
gave
*NL*
a
value
to
any
change
.
She
had
a
desire
to
leave
the
past
behind
her
*NL*
and
,
as
she
said
to
herself
,
to
begin
afresh
.
This
desire
indeed
was
not
*NL*
a
birth
of
the
present
occasion
;
it
was
as
familiar
as
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
rain
upon
the
window
and
it
had
led
to
her
beginning
afresh
a
great
many
*NL*
times
.
She
closed
her
eyes
as
she
sat
in
one
of
the
dusky
corners
of
the
*NL*
quiet
parlour
;
but
it
was
not
with
a
desire
for
dozing
forgetfulness
.
It
*NL*
was
on
the
contrary
because
she
felt
too
wide-eyed
and
wished
to
check
*NL*
the
sense
of
seeing
too
many
things
at
once
.
Her
imagination
was
by
*NL*
habit
ridiculously
active
;
when
the
door
was
not
open
it
jumped
out
of
*NL*
the
window
.
She
was
not
accustomed
indeed
to
keep
it
behind
bolts
;
and
*NL*
at
important
moments
,
when
she
would
have
been
thankful
to
make
use
*NL*
of
her
judgement
alone
,
she
paid
the
penalty
of
having
given
undue
*NL*
encouragement
to
the
faculty
of
seeing
without
judging
.
At
present
,
with
*NL*
her
sense
that
the
note
of
change
had
been
struck
,
came
gradually
a
host
*NL*
of
images
of
the
things
she
was
leaving
behind
her
.
The
years
and
hours
*NL*
of
her
life
came
back
to
her
,
and
for
a
long
time
,
in
a
stillness
broken
*NL*
only
by
the
ticking
of
the
big
bronze
clock
,
she
passed
them
in
*NL*
review
.
It
had
been
a
very
happy
life
and
she
had
been
a
very
fortunate
*NL*
person
--
this
was
the
truth
that
seemed
to
emerge
most
vividly
.
She
had
*NL*
had
the
best
of
everything
,
and
in
a
world
in
which
the
circumstances
*NL*
of
so
many
people
made
them
unenviable
it
was
an
advantage
never
to
have
*NL*
known
anything
particularly
unpleasant
.
It
appeared
to
Isabel
that
the
*NL*
unpleasant
had
been
even
too
absent
from
her
knowledge
,
for
she
had
*NL*
gathered
from
her
acquaintance
with
literature
that
it
was
often
a
*NL*
source
of
interest
and
even
of
instruction
.
Her
father
had
kept
it
*NL*
away
from
her
--
her
handsome
,
much
loved
father
,
who
always
had
such
*NL*
an
aversion
to
it
.
It
was
a
great
felicity
to
have
been
his
daughter
;
*NL*
Isabel
rose
even
to
pride
in
her
parentage
.
Since
his
death
she
had
*NL*
seemed
to
see
him
as
turning
his
braver
side
to
his
children
and
as
*NL*
not
having
managed
to
ignore
the
ugly
quite
so
much
in
practice
as
in
*NL*
aspiration
.
But
this
only
made
her
tenderness
for
him
greater
;
it
*NL*
was
scarcely
even
painful
to
have
to
suppose
him
too
generous
,
too
*NL*
good-natured
,
too
indifferent
to
sordid
considerations
.
Many
persons
*NL*
had
held
that
he
carried
this
indifference
too
far
,
especially
the
large
*NL*
number
of
those
to
whom
he
owed
money
.
Of
their
opinions
Isabel
was
*NL*
never
very
definitely
informed
;
but
it
may
interest
the
reader
to
know
*NL*
that
,
while
they
had
recognised
in
the
late
Mr.
Archer
a
remarkably
*NL*
handsome
head
and
a
very
taking
manner
-LRB-
indeed
,
as
one
of
them
had
said
,
*NL*
he
was
always
taking
something
-RRB-
,
they
had
declared
that
he
was
making
a
*NL*
very
poor
use
of
his
life
.
He
had
squandered
a
substantial
fortune
,
he
*NL*
had
been
deplorably
convivial
,
he
was
known
to
have
gambled
freely
.
*NL*
A
few
very
harsh
critics
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
had
not
even
*NL*
brought
up
his
daughters
.
They
had
had
no
regular
education
and
no
*NL*
permanent
home
;
they
had
been
at
once
spoiled
and
neglected
;
they
had
*NL*
lived
with
nursemaids
and
governesses
-LRB-
usually
very
bad
ones
-RRB-
or
had
*NL*
been
sent
to
superficial
schools
,
kept
by
the
French
,
from
which
,
at
the
*NL*
end
of
a
month
,
they
had
been
removed
in
tears
.
This
view
of
the
matter
*NL*
would
have
excited
Isabel
's
indignation
,
for
to
her
own
sense
her
*NL*
opportunities
had
been
large
.
Even
when
her
father
had
left
his
*NL*
daughters
for
three
months
at
Neufchatel
with
a
French
bonne
who
had
*NL*
eloped
with
a
Russian
nobleman
staying
at
the
same
hotel
--
even
in
this
*NL*
irregular
situation
-LRB-
an
incident
of
the
girl
's
eleventh
year
-RRB-
she
had
*NL*
been
neither
frightened
nor
ashamed
,
but
had
thought
it
a
romantic
*NL*
episode
in
a
liberal
education
.
Her
father
had
a
large
way
of
looking
at
*NL*
life
,
of
which
his
restlessness
and
even
his
occasional
incoherency
*NL*
of
conduct
had
been
only
a
proof
.
He
wished
his
daughters
,
even
as
*NL*
children
,
to
see
as
much
of
the
world
as
possible
;
and
it
was
for
this
*NL*
purpose
that
,
before
Isabel
was
fourteen
,
he
had
transported
them
three
*NL*
times
across
the
Atlantic
,
giving
them
on
each
occasion
,
however
,
but
a
*NL*
few
months
'
view
of
the
subject
proposed
:
a
course
which
had
whetted
*NL*
our
heroine
's
curiosity
without
enabling
her
to
satisfy
it
.
She
ought
to
*NL*
have
been
a
partisan
of
her
father
,
for
she
was
the
member
of
his
trio
*NL*
who
most
``
made
up
''
to
him
for
the
disagreeables
he
did
n't
mention
.
In
*NL*
his
last
days
his
general
willingness
to
take
leave
of
a
world
in
which
*NL*
the
difficulty
of
doing
as
one
liked
appeared
to
increase
as
one
grew
*NL*
older
had
been
sensibly
modified
by
the
pain
of
separation
from
his
*NL*
clever
,
his
superior
,
his
remarkable
girl
.
Later
,
when
the
journeys
to
*NL*
Europe
ceased
,
he
still
had
shown
his
children
all
sorts
of
indulgence
,
*NL*
and
if
he
had
been
troubled
about
money-matters
nothing
ever
disturbed
*NL*
their
irreflective
consciousness
of
many
possessions
.
Isabel
,
though
she
*NL*
danced
very
well
,
had
not
the
recollection
of
having
been
in
New
York
a
*NL*
successful
member
of
the
choreographic
circle
;
her
sister
Edith
was
,
*NL*
as
every
one
said
,
so
very
much
more
fetching
.
Edith
was
so
striking
*NL*
an
example
of
success
that
Isabel
could
have
no
illusions
as
to
what
*NL*
constituted
this
advantage
,
or
as
to
the
limits
of
her
own
power
to
*NL*
frisk
and
jump
and
shriek
--
above
all
with
rightness
of
effect
.
Nineteen
*NL*
persons
out
of
twenty
-LRB-
including
the
younger
sister
herself
-RRB-
pronounced
*NL*
Edith
infinitely
the
prettier
of
the
two
;
but
the
twentieth
,
besides
*NL*
reversing
this
judgement
,
had
the
entertainment
of
thinking
all
the
*NL*
others
aesthetic
vulgarians
.
Isabel
had
in
the
depths
of
her
nature
an
*NL*
even
more
unquenchable
desire
to
please
than
Edith
;
but
the
depths
of
*NL*
this
young
lady
's
nature
were
a
very
out-of-the-way
place
,
between
which
*NL*
and
the
surface
communication
was
interrupted
by
a
dozen
capricious
*NL*
forces
.
She
saw
the
young
men
who
came
in
large
numbers
to
see
her
*NL*
sister
;
but
as
a
general
thing
they
were
afraid
of
her
;
they
had
a
*NL*
belief
that
some
special
preparation
was
required
for
talking
with
her
.
*NL*
Her
reputation
of
reading
a
great
deal
hung
about
her
like
the
cloudy
*NL*
envelope
of
a
goddess
in
an
epic
;
it
was
supposed
to
engender
difficult
*NL*
questions
and
to
keep
the
conversation
at
a
low
temperature
.
The
poor
*NL*
girl
liked
to
be
thought
clever
,
but
she
hated
to
be
thought
bookish
;
*NL*
she
used
to
read
in
secret
and
,
though
her
memory
was
excellent
,
to
*NL*
abstain
from
showy
reference
.
She
had
a
great
desire
for
knowledge
,
but
*NL*
she
really
preferred
almost
any
source
of
information
to
the
printed
*NL*
page
;
she
had
an
immense
curiosity
about
life
and
was
constantly
staring
*NL*
and
wondering
.
She
carried
within
herself
a
great
fund
of
life
,
and
her
*NL*
deepest
enjoyment
was
to
feel
the
continuity
between
the
movements
of
*NL*
her
own
soul
and
the
agitations
of
the
world
.
For
this
reason
she
was
*NL*
fond
of
seeing
great
crowds
and
large
stretches
of
country
,
of
reading
*NL*
about
revolutions
and
wars
,
of
looking
at
historical
pictures
--
a
class
*NL*
of
efforts
as
to
which
she
had
often
committed
the
conscious
solecism
of
*NL*
forgiving
them
much
bad
painting
for
the
sake
of
the
subject
.
While
the
*NL*
Civil
War
went
on
she
was
still
a
very
young
girl
;
but
she
passed
months
*NL*
of
this
long
period
in
a
state
of
almost
passionate
excitement
,
in
which
*NL*
she
felt
herself
at
times
-LRB-
to
her
extreme
confusion
-RRB-
stirred
*NL*
almost
indiscriminately
by
the
valour
of
either
army
.
Of
course
the
*NL*
circumspection
of
suspicious
swains
had
never
gone
the
length
of
making
*NL*
her
a
social
proscript
;
for
the
number
of
those
whose
hearts
,
as
they
*NL*
approached
her
,
beat
only
just
fast
enough
to
remind
them
they
had
heads
*NL*
as
well
,
had
kept
her
unacquainted
with
the
supreme
disciplines
of
*NL*
her
sex
and
age
.
She
had
had
everything
a
girl
could
have
:
kindness
,
*NL*
admiration
,
bonbons
,
bouquets
,
the
sense
of
exclusion
from
none
of
the
*NL*
privileges
of
the
world
she
lived
in
,
abundant
opportunity
for
dancing
,
*NL*
plenty
of
new
dresses
,
the
London
Spectator
,
the
latest
publications
,
*NL*
the
music
of
Gounod
,
the
poetry
of
Browning
,
the
prose
of
George
Eliot
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
things
now
,
as
memory
played
over
them
,
resolved
themselves
into
a
*NL*
multitude
of
scenes
and
figures
.
Forgotten
things
came
back
to
her
;
many
*NL*
others
,
which
she
had
lately
thought
of
great
moment
,
dropped
out
of
*NL*
sight
.
The
result
was
kaleidoscopic
,
but
the
movement
of
the
instrument
*NL*
was
checked
at
last
by
the
servant
's
coming
in
with
the
name
of
a
*NL*
gentleman
.
The
name
of
the
gentleman
was
Caspar
Goodwood
;
he
was
a
*NL*
straight
young
man
from
Boston
,
who
had
known
Miss
Archer
for
the
last
*NL*
twelvemonth
and
who
,
thinking
her
the
most
beautiful
young
woman
of
her
*NL*
time
,
had
pronounced
the
time
,
according
to
the
rule
I
have
hinted
at
,
*NL*
a
foolish
period
of
history
.
He
sometimes
wrote
to
her
and
had
within
a
*NL*
week
or
two
written
from
New
York
.
She
had
thought
it
very
possible
he
*NL*
would
come
in
--
had
indeed
all
the
rainy
day
been
vaguely
expecting
him
.
*NL*
Now
that
she
learned
he
was
there
,
nevertheless
,
she
felt
no
eagerness
*NL*
to
receive
him
.
He
was
the
finest
young
man
she
had
ever
seen
,
was
*NL*
indeed
quite
a
splendid
young
man
;
he
inspired
her
with
a
sentiment
of
*NL*
high
,
of
rare
respect
.
She
had
never
felt
equally
moved
to
it
by
any
*NL*
other
person
.
He
was
supposed
by
the
world
in
general
to
wish
to
marry
*NL*
her
,
but
this
of
course
was
between
themselves
.
It
at
least
may
be
*NL*
affirmed
that
he
had
travelled
from
New
York
to
Albany
expressly
to
see
*NL*
her
;
having
learned
in
the
former
city
,
where
he
was
spending
a
few
*NL*
days
and
where
he
had
hoped
to
find
her
,
that
she
was
still
at
the
State
*NL*
capital
.
Isabel
delayed
for
some
minutes
to
go
to
him
;
she
moved
about
*NL*
the
room
with
a
new
sense
of
complications
.
But
at
last
she
presented
*NL*
herself
and
found
him
standing
near
the
lamp
.
He
was
tall
,
strong
and
*NL*
somewhat
stiff
;
he
was
also
lean
and
brown
.
He
was
not
romantically
,
he
*NL*
was
much
rather
obscurely
,
handsome
;
but
his
physiognomy
had
an
air
of
*NL*
requesting
your
attention
,
which
it
rewarded
according
to
the
charm
you
*NL*
found
in
blue
eyes
of
remarkable
fixedness
,
the
eyes
of
a
complexion
*NL*
other
than
his
own
,
and
a
jaw
of
the
somewhat
angular
mould
which
is
*NL*
supposed
to
bespeak
resolution
.
Isabel
said
to
herself
that
it
bespoke
*NL*
resolution
to-night
;
in
spite
of
which
,
in
half
an
hour
,
Caspar
*NL*
Goodwood
,
who
had
arrived
hopeful
as
well
as
resolute
,
took
his
way
back
*NL*
to
his
lodging
with
the
feeling
of
a
man
defeated
.
He
was
not
,
it
may
be
*NL*
added
,
a
man
weakly
to
accept
defeat
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
Touchett
was
a
philosopher
,
but
nevertheless
he
knocked
at
his
*NL*
mother
's
door
-LRB-
at
a
quarter
to
seven
-RRB-
with
a
good
deal
of
eagerness
.
*NL*
Even
philosophers
have
their
preferences
,
and
it
must
be
admitted
*NL*
that
of
his
progenitors
his
father
ministered
most
to
his
sense
of
the
*NL*
sweetness
of
filial
dependence
.
His
father
,
as
he
had
often
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
was
the
more
motherly
;
his
mother
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
*NL*
paternal
,
and
even
,
according
to
the
slang
of
the
day
,
gubernatorial
.
*NL*
She
was
nevertheless
very
fond
of
her
only
child
and
had
always
insisted
*NL*
on
his
spending
three
months
of
the
year
with
her
.
Ralph
rendered
*NL*
perfect
justice
to
her
affection
and
knew
that
in
her
thoughts
and
her
*NL*
thoroughly
arranged
and
servanted
life
his
turn
always
came
after
the
*NL*
other
nearest
subjects
of
her
solicitude
,
the
various
punctualities
of
*NL*
performance
of
the
workers
of
her
will
.
He
found
her
completely
dressed
*NL*
for
dinner
,
but
she
embraced
her
boy
with
her
gloved
hands
and
made
*NL*
him
sit
on
the
sofa
beside
her
.
She
enquired
scrupulously
about
her
*NL*
husband
's
health
and
about
the
young
man
's
own
,
and
,
receiving
no
*NL*
very
brilliant
account
of
either
,
remarked
that
she
was
more
than
ever
*NL*
convinced
of
her
wisdom
in
not
exposing
herself
to
the
English
climate
.
*NL*
In
this
case
she
also
might
have
given
way
.
Ralph
smiled
at
the
idea
of
*NL*
his
mother
's
giving
way
,
but
made
no
point
of
reminding
her
that
his
*NL*
own
infirmity
was
not
the
result
of
the
English
climate
,
from
which
he
*NL*
absented
himself
for
a
considerable
part
of
each
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
a
very
small
boy
when
his
father
,
Daniel
Tracy
Touchett
,
*NL*
a
native
of
Rutland
,
in
the
State
of
Vermont
,
came
to
England
as
*NL*
subordinate
partner
in
a
banking-house
where
some
ten
years
later
he
*NL*
gained
preponderant
control
.
Daniel
Touchett
saw
before
him
a
life-long
*NL*
residence
in
his
adopted
country
,
of
which
,
from
the
first
,
he
took
a
*NL*
simple
,
sane
and
accommodating
view
.
But
,
as
he
said
to
himself
,
he
had
*NL*
no
intention
of
disamericanising
,
nor
had
he
a
desire
to
teach
his
*NL*
only
son
any
such
subtle
art
.
It
had
been
for
himself
so
very
soluble
a
*NL*
problem
to
live
in
England
assimilated
yet
unconverted
that
it
seemed
to
*NL*
him
equally
simple
his
lawful
heir
should
after
his
death
carry
on
the
*NL*
grey
old
bank
in
the
white
American
light
.
He
was
at
pains
to
intensify
*NL*
this
light
,
however
,
by
sending
the
boy
home
for
his
education
.
Ralph
*NL*
spent
several
terms
at
an
American
school
and
took
a
degree
at
an
*NL*
American
university
,
after
which
,
as
he
struck
his
father
on
his
return
*NL*
as
even
redundantly
native
,
he
was
placed
for
some
three
years
in
*NL*
residence
at
Oxford
.
Oxford
swallowed
up
Harvard
,
and
Ralph
became
*NL*
at
last
English
enough
.
His
outward
conformity
to
the
manners
that
*NL*
surrounded
him
was
none
the
less
the
mask
of
a
mind
that
greatly
enjoyed
*NL*
its
independence
,
on
which
nothing
long
imposed
itself
,
and
which
,
*NL*
naturally
inclined
to
adventure
and
irony
,
indulged
in
a
boundless
*NL*
liberty
of
appreciation
.
He
began
with
being
a
young
man
of
promise
;
at
*NL*
Oxford
he
distinguished
himself
,
to
his
father
's
ineffable
satisfaction
,
*NL*
and
the
people
about
him
said
it
was
a
thousand
pities
so
clever
a
*NL*
fellow
should
be
shut
out
from
a
career
.
He
might
have
had
a
career
*NL*
by
returning
to
his
own
country
-LRB-
though
this
point
is
shrouded
in
*NL*
uncertainty
-RRB-
and
even
if
Mr.
Touchett
had
been
willing
to
part
with
*NL*
him
-LRB-
which
was
not
the
case
-RRB-
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
him
to
put
*NL*
a
watery
waste
permanently
between
himself
and
the
old
man
whom
he
*NL*
regarded
as
his
best
friend
.
Ralph
was
not
only
fond
of
his
father
,
*NL*
he
admired
him
--
he
enjoyed
the
opportunity
of
observing
him
.
Daniel
*NL*
Touchett
,
to
his
perception
,
was
a
man
of
genius
,
and
though
he
himself
*NL*
had
no
aptitude
for
the
banking
mystery
he
made
a
point
of
learning
*NL*
enough
of
it
to
measure
the
great
figure
his
father
had
played
.
It
was
*NL*
not
this
,
however
,
he
mainly
relished
;
it
was
the
fine
ivory
surface
,
*NL*
polished
as
by
the
English
air
,
that
the
old
man
had
opposed
to
*NL*
possibilities
of
penetration
.
Daniel
Touchett
had
been
neither
at
*NL*
Harvard
nor
at
Oxford
,
and
it
was
his
own
fault
if
he
had
placed
in
his
*NL*
son
's
hands
the
key
to
modern
criticism
.
Ralph
,
whose
head
was
full
*NL*
of
ideas
which
his
father
had
never
guessed
,
had
a
high
esteem
for
the
*NL*
latter
's
originality
.
Americans
,
rightly
or
wrongly
,
are
commended
for
*NL*
the
ease
with
which
they
adapt
themselves
to
foreign
conditions
;
but
Mr.
*NL*
Touchett
had
made
of
the
very
limits
of
his
pliancy
half
the
ground
*NL*
of
his
general
success
.
He
had
retained
in
their
freshness
most
of
*NL*
his
marks
of
primary
pressure
;
his
tone
,
as
his
son
always
noted
with
*NL*
pleasure
,
was
that
of
the
more
luxuriant
parts
of
New
England
.
At
the
*NL*
end
of
his
life
he
had
become
,
on
his
own
ground
,
as
mellow
as
he
*NL*
was
rich
;
he
combined
consummate
shrewdness
with
the
disposition
*NL*
superficially
to
fraternise
,
and
his
``
social
position
,
''
on
which
he
had
*NL*
never
wasted
a
care
,
had
the
firm
perfection
of
an
unthumbed
fruit
.
It
*NL*
was
perhaps
his
want
of
imagination
and
of
what
is
called
the
historic
*NL*
consciousness
;
but
to
many
of
the
impressions
usually
made
by
English
*NL*
life
upon
the
cultivated
stranger
his
sense
was
completely
closed
.
There
*NL*
were
certain
differences
he
had
never
perceived
,
certain
habits
he
had
*NL*
never
formed
,
certain
obscurities
he
had
never
sounded
.
As
regards
these
*NL*
latter
,
on
the
day
he
had
sounded
them
his
son
would
have
thought
less
*NL*
well
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
,
on
leaving
Oxford
,
had
spent
a
couple
of
years
in
travelling
;
*NL*
after
which
he
had
found
himself
perched
on
a
high
stool
in
his
father
's
*NL*
bank
.
The
responsibility
and
honour
of
such
positions
is
not
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
measured
by
the
height
of
the
stool
,
which
depends
upon
other
*NL*
considerations
:
Ralph
,
indeed
,
who
had
very
long
legs
,
was
fond
of
*NL*
standing
,
and
even
of
walking
about
,
at
his
work
.
To
this
exercise
,
*NL*
however
,
he
was
obliged
to
devote
but
a
limited
period
,
for
at
the
end
*NL*
of
some
eighteen
months
he
had
become
aware
of
his
being
seriously
out
*NL*
of
health
.
He
had
caught
a
violent
cold
,
which
fixed
itself
on
his
lungs
*NL*
and
threw
them
into
dire
confusion
.
He
had
to
give
up
work
and
apply
,
*NL*
to
the
letter
,
the
sorry
injunction
to
take
care
of
himself
.
At
first
he
*NL*
slighted
the
task
;
it
appeared
to
him
it
was
not
himself
in
the
least
*NL*
he
was
taking
care
of
,
but
an
uninteresting
and
uninterested
person
*NL*
with
whom
he
had
nothing
in
common
.
This
person
,
however
,
improved
*NL*
on
acquaintance
,
and
Ralph
grew
at
last
to
have
a
certain
grudging
*NL*
tolerance
,
even
an
undemonstrative
respect
,
for
him
.
Misfortune
makes
*NL*
strange
bedfellows
,
and
our
young
man
,
feeling
that
he
had
something
*NL*
at
stake
in
the
matter
--
it
usually
struck
him
as
his
reputation
for
*NL*
ordinary
wit
--
devoted
to
his
graceless
charge
an
amount
of
attention
of
*NL*
which
note
was
duly
taken
and
which
had
at
least
the
effect
of
keeping
*NL*
the
poor
fellow
alive
.
One
of
his
lungs
began
to
heal
,
the
other
*NL*
promised
to
follow
its
example
,
and
he
was
assured
he
might
outweather
*NL*
a
dozen
winters
if
he
would
betake
himself
to
those
climates
in
which
*NL*
consumptives
chiefly
congregate
.
As
he
had
grown
extremely
fond
of
*NL*
London
,
he
cursed
the
flatness
of
exile
:
but
at
the
same
time
that
he
*NL*
cursed
he
conformed
,
and
gradually
,
when
he
found
his
sensitive
organ
*NL*
grateful
even
for
grim
favours
,
he
conferred
them
with
a
lighter
hand
.
*NL*
He
wintered
abroad
,
as
the
phrase
is
;
basked
in
the
sun
,
stopped
at
home
*NL*
when
the
wind
blew
,
went
to
bed
when
it
rained
,
and
once
or
twice
,
when
*NL*
it
had
snowed
overnight
,
almost
never
got
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
secret
hoard
of
indifference
--
like
a
thick
cake
a
fond
old
nurse
might
*NL*
have
slipped
into
his
first
school
outfit
--
came
to
his
aid
and
helped
to
*NL*
reconcile
him
to
sacrifice
;
since
at
the
best
he
was
too
ill
for
aught
*NL*
but
that
arduous
game
.
As
he
said
to
himself
,
there
was
really
nothing
*NL*
he
had
wanted
very
much
to
do
,
so
that
he
had
at
least
not
renounced
the
*NL*
field
of
valour
.
At
present
,
however
,
the
fragrance
of
forbidden
fruit
*NL*
seemed
occasionally
to
float
past
him
and
remind
him
that
the
finest
of
*NL*
pleasures
is
the
rush
of
action
.
Living
as
he
now
lived
was
like
reading
*NL*
a
good
book
in
a
poor
translation
--
a
meagre
entertainment
for
a
young
*NL*
man
who
felt
that
he
might
have
been
an
excellent
linguist
.
He
had
good
*NL*
winters
and
poor
winters
,
and
while
the
former
lasted
he
was
sometimes
*NL*
the
sport
of
a
vision
of
virtual
recovery
.
But
this
vision
was
dispelled
*NL*
some
three
years
before
the
occurrence
of
the
incidents
with
which
this
*NL*
history
opens
:
he
had
on
that
occasion
remained
later
than
usual
in
*NL*
England
and
had
been
overtaken
by
bad
weather
before
reaching
Algiers
.
*NL*
He
arrived
more
dead
than
alive
and
lay
there
for
several
weeks
between
*NL*
life
and
death
.
His
convalescence
was
a
miracle
,
but
the
first
use
he
*NL*
made
of
it
was
to
assure
himself
that
such
miracles
happen
but
once
.
He
*NL*
said
to
himself
that
his
hour
was
in
sight
and
that
it
behoved
him
to
*NL*
keep
his
eyes
upon
it
,
yet
that
it
was
also
open
to
him
to
spend
the
*NL*
interval
as
agreeably
as
might
be
consistent
with
such
a
preoccupation
.
*NL*
With
the
prospect
of
losing
them
the
simple
use
of
his
faculties
became
*NL*
an
exquisite
pleasure
;
it
seemed
to
him
the
joys
of
contemplation
had
*NL*
never
been
sounded
.
He
was
far
from
the
time
when
he
had
found
it
hard
*NL*
that
he
should
be
obliged
to
give
up
the
idea
of
distinguishing
himself
;
*NL*
an
idea
none
the
less
importunate
for
being
vague
and
none
the
less
*NL*
delightful
for
having
had
to
struggle
in
the
same
breast
with
bursts
*NL*
of
inspiring
self-criticism
.
His
friends
at
present
judged
him
more
*NL*
cheerful
,
and
attributed
it
to
a
theory
,
over
which
they
shook
their
*NL*
heads
knowingly
,
that
he
would
recover
his
health
.
His
serenity
was
but
*NL*
the
array
of
wild
flowers
niched
in
his
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
probably
this
sweet-tasting
property
of
the
observed
thing
*NL*
in
itself
that
was
mainly
concerned
in
Ralph
's
quickly-stirred
interest
*NL*
in
the
advent
of
a
young
lady
who
was
evidently
not
insipid
.
If
he
was
*NL*
consideringly
disposed
,
something
told
him
,
here
was
occupation
enough
*NL*
for
a
succession
of
days
.
It
may
be
added
,
in
summary
fashion
,
that
the
*NL*
imagination
of
loving
--
as
distinguished
from
that
of
being
loved
--
had
*NL*
still
a
place
in
his
reduced
sketch
.
He
had
only
forbidden
himself
the
*NL*
riot
of
expression
.
However
,
he
should
n't
inspire
his
cousin
with
a
*NL*
passion
,
nor
would
she
be
able
,
even
should
she
try
,
to
help
him
to
one
.
*NL*
``
And
now
tell
me
about
the
young
lady
,
''
he
said
to
his
mother
.
``
What
do
*NL*
you
mean
to
do
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
was
prompt
.
``
I
mean
to
ask
your
father
to
invite
her
to
*NL*
stay
three
or
four
weeks
at
Gardencourt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
stand
on
any
such
ceremony
as
that
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
My
father
*NL*
will
ask
her

a

of

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

n't
know
about

's

his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
,
dear
mother
;
what
a
sense
of
property
!
That
's
all
the
more
*NL*
reason

his
asking
her
.
But
after
that

I
mean
after
three
months

its
absurd
asking
the
poor

to
remain

for
three

do

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

mean
to
get
her

*NL*
``
Ah
yes

of
course

But
independently
of
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
invite

with

in
Florence

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

n't
rise
above

said
Ralph
.
``
I

like
*NL*
to
know
what
you

do
with
her
in
a
general
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
duty
!
''
Mrs.
Touchett
declared
.
``
I
suppose
you
pity
her
very
much

''
*NL*
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

do
n't

does
n't
strike
me

being
sure

however
,
give
me
a

hint
of
where
you
see
your
duty

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
showing
her
four
European

shall
leave

giving

perfecting
herself
in

already
knows
very
well

*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
frowned
a
little
.
``
That
sounds
rather
dry

even
allowing
her
the
*NL*
choice
of
two
of
the
countries

*NL*
``
If
it
's
dry
,

said
his
mother
with
a
laugh
,
``
you
can
leave
Isabel
alone

to
water

She
is
as
good

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
she
's
a
gifted

but
she
's
a
clever
*NL*
girl

with
a
strong
will
and
a
high
temper
.
She
has
no
idea
of
being
*NL*
bored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
imagine
that
,
''
said
Ralph
;
and
then
he
added
abruptly
:
``
How
do
*NL*
you
two
get
on
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
by
that

*NL*
Some
girls
might
,
I
know
;
but
Isabel
's
too
clever
for
that
.
I
think
I
*NL*
greatly
amuse
her
.
We
get
on
because
I
understand
her
,

know
the
sort

is

's
very
frank
,

very
frank

just
what

to
expect
of
each

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
dear
mother
,
''
Ralph
exclaimed
,
``
one
always
knows
what
to
expect
*NL*
of
you

You
've
never
surprised
me
but
once
,
and
that
's
to-day
--
in
*NL*
presenting
me
with
a
pretty
cousin
whose
existence
I
had
never
*NL*
suspected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
her
so
very
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
pretty
indeed
;
but
I
do
n't
insist
upon
that
.
It
's
her
general
*NL*
air
of
being
some
one
in
particular
that
strikes
me
.
Who
is
this
rare
*NL*
creature
,
and
what
is
she
?
Where
did
you
find
her
,
and
how
did
you
make
*NL*
her
acquaintance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
her
in
an
old
house
at
Albany
,
sitting
in
a
dreary
room
on
a
*NL*
rainy
day
,
reading
a
heavy
book
and
boring
herself
to
death
.
She
did
n't
*NL*
know
she
was
bored
,
but
when
I
left
her
no
doubt
of
it
she
seemed
very
*NL*
grateful
for
the
service
.
You
may
say
I
should
n't
have
enlightened
he
--
I
*NL*
should
have
let
her
alone
.
There
's
a
good
deal
in
that
,
but
I
acted
*NL*
conscientiously
;
I
thought
she
was
meant
for
something
better
.
It
*NL*
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
take
her
about
and
*NL*
introduce
her
to
the
world
.
She
thinks
she
knows
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
it
--
like
most
American
girls
;
but
like
most
American
girls
she
's
*NL*
ridiculously
mistaken
.
If
you
want
to
know
,
I
thought
she
would
do
me
*NL*
credit
.
I
like
to
be
well
thought
of
,
and
for
a
woman
of
my
age
there
's
*NL*
no
greater
convenience
,
in
some
ways
,
than
an
attractive
niece
.
You
*NL*
know
I
had
seen
nothing
of
my
sister
's
children
for
years
;
I
disapproved
*NL*
entirely
of
the
father
.
But
I
always
meant
to
do
something
for
them
when
*NL*
he
should
have
gone
to
his
reward
.
I
ascertained
where
they
were
to
be
*NL*
found
and
,
without
any
preliminaries
,
went
and
introduced
myself
.
There
*NL*
are
two
others
of
them
,
both
of
whom
are
married
;
but
I
saw
only
the
*NL*
elder
,
who
has
,
by
the
way
,
a
very
uncivil
husband
.
The
wife
,
whose
name
*NL*
is
Lily
,
jumped
at
the
idea
of
my
taking
an
interest
in
Isabel
;
she
*NL*
said
it
was
just
what
her
sister
needed
--
that
some
one
should
take
*NL*
an
interest
in
her
.
She
spoke
of
her
as
you
might
speak
of
some
young
*NL*
person
of
genius
--
in
want
of
encouragement
and
patronage
.
It
may
be
that
*NL*
Isabel
's
a
genius
;
but
in
that
case
I
've
not
yet
learned
her
special
*NL*
line
.
Mrs.
Ludlow
was
especially
keen
about
my
taking
her
to
Europe
;
*NL*
they
all
regard
Europe
over
there
as
a
land
of
emigration
,
of
rescue
,
a
*NL*
refuge
for
their
superfluous
population
.
Isabel
herself
seemed
very
*NL*
glad
to
come
,
and
the
thing
was
easily
arranged
.
There
was
a
little
*NL*
difficulty
about
the
money-question
,
as
she
seemed
averse
to
being
*NL*
under
pecuniary
obligations
.
But
she
has
a
small
income
and
she
supposes
*NL*
herself
to
be
travelling
at
her
own
expense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
had
listened
attentively
to
this
judicious
report
,
by
which
his
*NL*
interest
in
the
subject
of
it
was
not
impaired
.
``
Ah
,
if
she
's
a
genius
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
we
must
find
out
her
special
line
.
Is
it
by
chance
for
*NL*
flirting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
.
You
may
suspect
that
at
first
,
but
you
'll
be
wrong

*NL*
You
wo
n't
,
I
think
,
in
anyway
,
be
easily
right
about
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Warburton
's
wrong
then

Ralph
rejoicingly
exclaimed
.
``
He
flatters
*NL*
himself

has
made
that
discovery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
shook
her
head
.
``
Lord
Warburton
wo
n't
understand
her

He
*NL*
need
n't
try

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
very
intelligent

''
said
Ralph
;
``
but
it
's
right
he
should
be
*NL*
puzzled
once
in
a
while

*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabel
will
enjoy
puzzling
a
lord

Mrs.
Touchett
remarked
.
*NL*

Her
son
frowned
a
little
.
``
What
does
she
know
about
lords

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
at
all

that
will
puzzle
him
all
the
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
greeted
these
words
with
a
laugh
and
looked
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
Then
,
``
Are
you
not
going
down
to
see
my
father
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
a
quarter
to
eight
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
son
looked
at
his
watch
.
``
You
've
another
quarter
of
an
hour
then
.
*NL*
Tell
me
some
more
about
Isabel
.
''
After
which
,
as
Mrs.
Touchett
declined
*NL*
his
invitation
,
declaring
that
he
must
find
out
for
himself
,
``
Well
,
''
he
*NL*
pursued
,
``
she
'll
certainly
do
you
credit
.
But
wo
n't
she
also
give
you
*NL*
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
;
but
if
she
does
I
shall
not
shrink
from
it
.
I
never
do
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
strikes
me
as
very
natural
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natural
people
are
not
the
most
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Ralph
;
``
you
yourself
are
a
proof
of
that
.
You
're
extremely
*NL*
natural
,
and
I
'm
sure
you
have
never
troubled
any
one
.
It
takes
trouble
*NL*
to
do
that
.
But
tell
me
this
;
it
just
occurs
to
me
.
Is
Isabel
capable
of
*NL*
making
herself
disagreeable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
cried
his
mother
,
``
you
ask
too
many
questions
!
Find
that
out
for
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
questions
,
however
,
were
not
exhausted
.
``
All
this
time
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
you
've
not
told
me
what
you
intend
to
do
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
with
her
?
You
talk
as
if
she
were
a
yard
of
calico
.
I
shall
do
*NL*
absolutely
nothing
with
her
,
and
she
herself
will
do
everything
she
*NL*
chooses
.
She
gave
me
notice
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
meant
then
,
in
your
telegram
,
was
that
her
character
's
*NL*
independent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
know
what
I
mean
in
my
telegrams
--
especially
those
I
send
from
*NL*
America
.
Clearness
is
too
expensive
.
Come
down
to
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
yet
a
quarter
to
eight
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
allow
for
his
impatience
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
answered
.
Ralph
knew
*NL*
what
to
think
of
his
father
's
impatience
;
but
,
making
no
rejoinder
,
he
*NL*
offered
his
mother
his
arm
.
This
put
it
in
his
power
,
as
they
*NL*
descended
together
,
to
stop
her
a
moment
on
the
middle
landing
of
the
*NL*
staircase
--
the
broad
,
low
,
wide-armed
staircase
of
time-blackened
oak
*NL*
which
was
one
of
the
most
striking
features
of
Gardencourt
.
``
You
've
no
*NL*
plan
of
marrying
her
?
''
he
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marrying
her
?
I
should
be
sorry
to
play
her
such
a
trick
!
But
apart
*NL*
from
that
,
she
's
perfectly
able
to
marry
herself
.
She
has
every
*NL*
facility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
say
she
has
a
husband
picked
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
a
husband
,
but
there
's
a
young
man
in
Boston
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
went
on
;
he
had
no
desire
to
hear
about
the
young
man
in
Boston
.
*NL*
``
As
my
father
says
,
they
're
always
engaged
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
had
told
him
that
he
must
satisfy
his
curiosity
at
the
*NL*
source
,
and
it
soon
became
evident
he
should
not
want
for
occasion
.
He
*NL*
had
a
good
deal
of
talk
with
his
young
kinswoman
when
the
two
had
been
*NL*
left
together
in
the
drawing-room
.
Lord
Warburton
,
who
had
ridden
over
*NL*
from
his
own
house
,
some
ten
miles
distant
,
remounted
and
took
his
*NL*
departure
before
dinner
;
and
an
hour
after
this
meal
was
ended
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
,
who
appeared
to
have
quite
emptied
the
measure
of
their
*NL*
forms
,
withdrew
,
under
the
valid
pretext
of
fatigue
,
to
their
respective
*NL*
apartments
.
The
young
man
spent
an
hour
with
his
cousin
;
though
she
had
*NL*
been
travelling
half
the
day
she
appeared
in
no
degree
spent
.
She
was
*NL*
really
tired
;
she
knew
it
,
and
knew
she
should
pay
for
it
on
the
morrow
;
*NL*
but
it
was
her
habit
at
this
period
to
carry
exhaustion
to
the
furthest
*NL*
point
and
confess
to
it
only
when
dissimulation
broke
down
.
A
fine
*NL*
hypocrisy
was
for
the
present
possible
;
she
was
interested
;
she
was
,
as
*NL*
she
said
to
herself
,
floated
.
She
asked
Ralph
to
show
her
the
pictures
;
*NL*
there
were
a
great
many
in
the
house
,
most
of
them
of
his
own
choosing
.
*NL*
The
best
were
arranged
in
an
oaken
gallery
,
of
charming
proportions
,
*NL*
which
had
a
sitting-room
at
either
end
of
it
and
which
in
the
evening
*NL*
was
usually
lighted
.
The
light
was
insufficient
to
show
the
pictures
*NL*
to
advantage
,
and
the
visit
might
have
stood
over
to
the
morrow
.
*NL*
This
suggestion
Ralph
had
ventured
to
make
;
but
Isabel
looked
*NL*
disappointed
--
smiling
still
,
however
--
and
said
:
``
If
you
please
I
should
*NL*
like
to
see
them
just
a
little
.
''
She
was
eager
,
she
knew
she
was
eager
*NL*
and
now
seemed
so
;
she
could
n't
help
it
.
``
She
does
n't
take
suggestions
,
''
*NL*
Ralph
said
to
himself
;
but
he
said
it
without
irritation
;
her
pressure
*NL*
amused
and
even
pleased
him
.
The
lamps
were
on
brackets
,
at
intervals
,
*NL*
and
if
the
light
was
imperfect
it
was
genial
.
It
fell
upon
the
vague
*NL*
squares
of
rich
colour
and
on
the
faded
gilding
of
heavy
frames
;
it
made
*NL*
a
sheen
on
the
polished
floor
of
the
gallery
.
Ralph
took
a
candlestick
*NL*
and
moved
about
,
pointing
out
the
things
he
liked
;
Isabel
,
inclining
to
*NL*
one
picture
after
another
,
indulged
in
little
exclamations
and
murmurs
.
*NL*
She
was
evidently
a
judge
;
she
had
a
natural
taste
;
he
was
struck
with
*NL*
that
.
She
took
a
candlestick
herself
and
held
it
slowly
here
and
there
;
*NL*
she
lifted
it
high
,
and
as
she
did
so
he
found
himself
pausing
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
place
and
bending
his
eyes
much
less
upon
the
pictures
*NL*
than
on
her
presence
.
He
lost
nothing
,
in
truth
,
by
these
wandering
*NL*
glances
,
for
she
was
better
worth
looking
at
than
most
works
of
art
.
*NL*
She
was
undeniably
spare
,
and
ponderably
light
,
and
proveably
tall
;
when
*NL*
people
had
wished
to
distinguish
her
from
the
other
two
Miss
Archers
*NL*
they
had
always
called
her
the
willowy
one
.
Her
hair
,
which
was
dark
*NL*
even
to
blackness
,
had
been
an
object
of
envy
to
many
women
;
her
light
*NL*
grey
eyes
,
a
little
too
firm
perhaps
in
her
graver
moments
,
had
an
*NL*
enchanting
range
of
concession
.
They
walked
slowly
up
one
side
of
the
*NL*
gallery
and
down
the
other
,
and
then
she
said
:
``
Well
,
now
I
know
more
*NL*
than
I
did
when
I
began
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
apparently
have
a
great
passion
for
knowledge
,
''
her
cousin
*NL*
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
have
;
most
girls
are
horridly
ignorant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
strike
me
as
different
from
most
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
some
of
them
would
--
but
the
way
they
're
talked
to
!
''
murmured
*NL*
Isabel
,
who
preferred
not
to
dilate
just
yet
on
herself
.
Then
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
to
change
the
subject
,
``
Please
tell
me
--
is
n't
there
a
ghost
?
''
*NL*
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
ghost
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
castle-spectre
,
a
thing
that
appears
.
We
call
them
ghosts
in
*NL*
America
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
do
here
,
when
we
see
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
see
them
then
?
You
ought
to
,
in
this
romantic
old
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
romantic
old
house
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
You
'll
be
disappointed
if
*NL*
you
count
on
that
.
It
's
a
dismally
prosaic
one
;
there
's
no
romance
here
*NL*
but
what
you
may
have
brought
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
brought
a
great
deal
;
but
it
seems
to
me
I
've
brought
it
to
the
*NL*
right
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
keep
it
out
of
harm
,
certainly
;
nothing
will
ever
happen
to
it
here
,
*NL*
between
my
father
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
looked
at
him
a
moment
.
``
Is
there
never
any
one
here
but
your
*NL*
father
and
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
,
of
course

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
know
your
mother

she
's
not
romantic

Have
n't
you
other
people

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
few

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry

that

much

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

we
'll
invite
all
the
county
to
amuse
you

said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
're
making
fun
of
me
,
''
the
girl
answered
rather
gravely
.
``
Who
*NL*
was
the
gentleman
on
the
lawn
when
I
arrived
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

neighbour

he
does
n't
come
very
often

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry

I
liked
him

said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
barely
spoke
to
him

Ralph
objected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

I
like
him
all
the

I
like
your

*NL*
immensely

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
do
better

He
's
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
sorry
he
is
ill

said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
help
me

nurse
him

be
a
good
nurse

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

But
you

''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
,
however
,
gave
no
heed
to
this
observation
.
``
You
like
my
father

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like

And
Isabel
found
*NL*
herself
attempting
to
assign
a
reason
for
her
affection
for
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
we
never
know
why

said
her
companion
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
know
why

the
girl
answered

``
It
's
because
she
does
n't
expect

one
to
like

She
does
n't
care

does

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
adore
her

out
of
perversity

I
take
greatly

said
Ralph

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens

how
you
see

he
cried
with
a
dismay
that
was
*NL*
not
altogether
jocular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
like
you
all
the

his
cousin
went
on

``
The
way

the
matter
will
be

show
me
the
ghost

*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
shook
his
head
sadly
.
``
I
might
show
it
to
you

you
'd
never
see

it

The
privilege
is

given
to
every
one

it
's
not
enviable
.
It
has
*NL*
never
been
seen
by
a
young
,
happy
,
innocent
person
like
you
.
You
must
*NL*
have
suffered
first
,
have
suffered
greatly
,
have
gained
some
miserable
*NL*
knowledge
.
In
that
way
your
eyes
are
opened
to
it

I
saw
it
long
ago

*NL*
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
just
now
I
'm
very
fond

Isabel
answered

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

of
happy
knowledge

of
pleasant
knowledge

you

I
hope

'll
never
see

ghost

*NL*
*NL*
She
had
listened
to
him
attentively
,
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
,
but
with
*NL*
a
certain
gravity
in
her
eyes
.
Charming
as
he
found
her
,
she
had
struck
*NL*
him
as
rather
presumptuous
--
indeed
it
was
a
part
of
her
charm
;
and
he
*NL*
wondered
what
she
would
say
.
``
I
'm
not
afraid
,
you
know
,
''
she
said
:
which
*NL*
seemed
quite
presumptuous
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
afraid

suffering

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
'm
afraid

But
I

not
afraid

I

*NL*
people
suffer
too
easily

she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
you
do

said
Ralph
,
looking
at
her
with
his
hands
in
*NL*
his
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
that
's
a
fault

''
she
answered
.
``
It
's
not
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
to
suffer
;
we
were
not
made
for
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
not

certainly

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

And
she
wandered
off
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

it
is
n't
a

said
her

Only

They
passed
out
of
the

from

and
paused
in
the
hall
,
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
staircase

Here
Ralph
presented
his
companion
with
her
bedroom
candle
,

which
he
had
taken
from
a
niche

``
Never

*NL*
She
looked
at

a
little

she
had
taken
her
candle
and
placed
her

*NL*
on
the
oaken

``
Well

she
said

She
turned
away

he
watched
her

in

he
went
back

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
Archer
was
a
young
person
of
many
theories
;
her
imagination
was
*NL*
remarkably
active
.
It
had
been
her
fortune
to
possess
a
finer
mind
*NL*
than
most
of
the
persons
among
whom
her
lot
was
cast
;
to
have
a
larger
*NL*
perception
of
surrounding
facts
and
to
care
for
knowledge
that
was
*NL*
tinged
with
the
unfamiliar
.
It
is
true
that
among
her
contemporaries
*NL*
she
passed
for
a
young
woman
of
extraordinary
profundity
;
for
these
*NL*
excellent
people
never
withheld
their
admiration
from
a
reach
of
*NL*
intellect
of
which
they
themselves
were
not
conscious
,
and
spoke
of
*NL*
Isabel
as
a
prodigy
of
learning
,
a
creature
reported
to
have
read
the
*NL*
classic
authors
--
in
translations
.
Her
paternal
aunt
,
Mrs.
Varian
,
once
*NL*
spread
the
rumour
that
Isabel
was
writing
a
book
--
Mrs.
Varian
having
a
*NL*
reverence
for
books
,
and
averred
that
the
girl
would
distinguish
herself
*NL*
in
print
.
Mrs.
Varian
thought
highly
of
literature
,
for
which
she
*NL*
entertained
that
esteem
that
is
connected
with
a
sense
of
privation
.
*NL*
Her
own
large
house
,
remarkable
for
its
assortment
of
mosaic
tables
and
*NL*
decorated
ceilings
,
was
unfurnished
with
a
library
,
and
in
the
way
of
*NL*
printed
volumes
contained
nothing
but
half
a
dozen
novels
in
paper
on
*NL*
a
shelf
in
the
apartment
of
one
of
the
Miss
Varians
.
Practically
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Varian
's
acquaintance
with
literature
was
confined
to
The
New
York
*NL*
Interviewer
;
as
she
very
justly
said
,
after
you
had
read
the
Interviewer
*NL*
you
had
lost
all
faith
in
culture
.
Her
tendency
,
with
this
,
was
rather
*NL*
to
keep
the
Interviewer
out
of
the
way
of
her
daughters
;
she
was
*NL*
determined
to
bring
them
up
properly
,
and
they
read
nothing
at
all
.
Her
*NL*
impression
with
regard
to
Isabel
's
labours
was
quite
illusory
;
the
girl
*NL*
had
never
attempted
to
write
a
book
and
had
no
desire
for
the
laurels
*NL*
of
authorship
.
She
had
no
talent
for
expression
and
too
little
of
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
genius
;
she
only
had
a
general
idea
that
people
were
*NL*
right
when
they
treated
her
as
if
she
were
rather
superior
.
Whether
or
*NL*
no
she
were
superior
,
people
were
right
in
admiring
her
if
they
thought
*NL*
her
so
;
for
it
seemed
to
her
often
that
her
mind
moved
more
quickly
*NL*
than
theirs
,
and
this
encouraged
an
impatience
that
might
easily
be
*NL*
confounded
with
superiority
.
It
may
be
affirmed
without
delay
that
*NL*
Isabel
was
probably
very
liable
to
the
sin
of
self-esteem
;
she
often
*NL*
surveyed
with
complacency
the
field
of
her
own
nature
;
she
was
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
taking
for
granted
,
on
scanty
evidence
,
that
she
was
right
;
*NL*
she
treated
herself
to
occasions
of
homage
.
Meanwhile
her
errors
and
*NL*
delusions
were
frequently
such
as
a
biographer
interested
in
preserving
*NL*
the
dignity
of
his
subject
must
shrink
from
specifying
.
Her
thoughts
*NL*
were
a
tangle
of
vague
outlines
which
had
never
been
corrected
by
the
*NL*
judgement
of
people
speaking
with
authority
.
In
matters
of
opinion
*NL*
she
had
had
her
own
way
,
and
it
had
led
her
into
a
thousand
ridiculous
*NL*
zigzags
.
At
moments
she
discovered
she
was
grotesquely
wrong
,
and
then
*NL*
she
treated
herself
to
a
week
of
passionate
humility
.
After
this
she
*NL*
held
her
head
higher
than
ever
again
;
for
it
was
of
no
use
,
she
had
an
*NL*
unquenchable
desire
to
think
well
of
herself
.
She
had
a
theory
that
it
*NL*
was
only
under
this
provision
life
was
worth
living
;
that
one
should
*NL*
be
one
of
the
best
,
should
be
conscious
of
a
fine
organisation
-LRB-
she
*NL*
could
n't
help
knowing
her
organisation
was
fine
-RRB-
,
should
move
in
a
realm
*NL*
of
light
,
of
natural
wisdom
,
of
happy
impulse
,
of
inspiration
gracefully
*NL*
chronic
.
It
was
almost
as
unnecessary
to
cultivate
doubt
of
one
's
self
*NL*
as
to
cultivate
doubt
of
one
's
best
friend
:
one
should
try
to
be
one
's
*NL*
own
best
friend
and
to
give
one
's
self
,
in
this
manner
,
distinguished
*NL*
company
.
The
girl
had
a
certain
nobleness
of
imagination
which
rendered
*NL*
her
a
good
many
services
and
played
her
a
great
many
tricks
.
She
spent
*NL*
half
her
time
in
thinking
of
beauty
and
bravery
and
magnanimity
;
she
had
*NL*
a
fixed
determination
to
regard
the
world
as
a
place
of
brightness
,
of
*NL*
free
expansion
,
of
irresistible
action
:
she
held
it
must
be
detestable
*NL*
to
be
afraid
or
ashamed
.
She
had
an
infinite
hope
that
she
should
never
*NL*
do
anything
wrong
.
She
had
resented
so
strongly
,
after
discovering
them
,
*NL*
her
mere
errors
of
feeling
-LRB-
the
discovery
always
made
her
tremble
as
if
*NL*
she
had
escaped
from
a
trap
which
might
have
caught
her
and
smothered
*NL*
her
-RRB-
that
the
chance
of
inflicting
a
sensible
injury
upon
another
*NL*
person
,
presented
only
as
a
contingency
,
caused
her
at
moments
to
hold
*NL*
her
breath
.
That
always
struck
her
as
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
*NL*
to
her
.
On
the
whole
,
reflectively
,
she
was
in
no
uncertainty
about
*NL*
the
things
that
were
wrong
.
She
had
no
love
of
their
look
,
but
when
*NL*
she
fixed
them
hard
she
recognised
them
.
It
was
wrong
to
be
mean
,
to
be
*NL*
jealous
,
to
be
false
,
to
be
cruel
;
she
had
seen
very
little
of
the
evil
*NL*
of
the
world
,
but
she
had
seen
women
who
lied
and
who
tried
to
hurt
*NL*
each
other
.
Seeing
such
things
had
quickened
her
high
spirit
;
it
seemed
*NL*
indecent
not
to
scorn
them
.
Of
course
the
danger
of
a
high
spirit
was
*NL*
the
danger
of
inconsistency
--
the
danger
of
keeping
up
the
flag
after
the
*NL*
place
has
surrendered
;
a
sort
of
behaviour
so
crooked
as
to
be
almost
*NL*
a
dishonour
to
the
flag
.
But
Isabel
,
who
knew
little
of
the
sorts
of
*NL*
artillery
to
which
young
women
are
exposed
,
flattered
herself
that
such
*NL*
contradictions
would
never
be
noted
in
her
own
conduct
.
Her
life
should
*NL*
always
be
in
harmony
with
the
most
pleasing
impression
she
should
*NL*
produce
;
she
would
be
what
she
appeared
,
and
she
would
appear
what
she
*NL*
was
.
Sometimes
she
went
so
far
as
to
wish
that
she
might
find
herself
*NL*
some
day
in
a
difficult
position
,
so
that
she
should
have
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
being
as
heroic
as
the
occasion
demanded
.
Altogether
,
with
her
meagre
*NL*
knowledge
,
her
inflated
ideals
,
her
confidence
at
once
innocent
and
*NL*
dogmatic
,
her
temper
at
once
exacting
and
indulgent
,
her
mixture
of
*NL*
curiosity
and
fastidiousness
,
of
vivacity
and
indifference
,
her
desire
*NL*
to
look
very
well
and
to
be
if
possible
even
better
,
her
determination
*NL*
to
see
,
to
try
,
to
know
,
her
combination
of
the
delicate
,
desultory
,
*NL*
flame-like
spirit
and
the
eager
and
personal
creature
of
conditions
:
she
*NL*
would
be
an
easy
victim
of
scientific
criticism
if
she
were
not
intended
*NL*
to
awaken
on
the
reader
's
part
an
impulse
more
tender
and
more
purely
*NL*
expectant
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
her
theories
that
Isabel
Archer
was
very
fortunate
in
*NL*
being
independent
,
and
that
she
ought
to
make
some
very
enlightened
use
*NL*
of
that
state
.
She
never
called
it
the
state
of
solitude
,
much
less
of
*NL*
singleness
;
she
thought
such
descriptions
weak
,
and
,
besides
,
her
sister
*NL*
Lily
constantly
urged
her
to
come
and
abide
.
She
had
a
friend
whose
*NL*
acquaintance
she
had
made
shortly
before
her
father
's
death
,
who
offered
*NL*
so
high
an
example
of
useful
activity
that
Isabel
always
thought
of
her
*NL*
as
a
model
.
Henrietta
Stackpole
had
the
advantage
of
an
admired
ability
;
*NL*
she
was
thoroughly
launched
in
journalism
,
and
her
letters
to
the
*NL*
Interviewer
,
from
Washington
,
Newport
,
the
White
Mountains
and
other
*NL*
places
,
were
universally
quoted
.
Isabel
pronounced
them
with
confidence
*NL*
``
ephemeral
,
''
but
she
esteemed
the
courage
,
energy
and
good-humour
of
the
*NL*
writer
,
who
,
without
parents
and
without
property
,
had
adopted
three
*NL*
of
the
children
of
an
infirm
and
widowed
sister
and
was
paying
their
*NL*
school-bills
out
of
the
proceeds
of
her
literary
labour
.
Henrietta
was
*NL*
in
the
van
of
progress
and
had
clear-cut
views
on
most
subjects
;
her
*NL*
cherished
desire
had
long
been
to
come
to
Europe
and
write
a
series
of
*NL*
letters
to
the
Interviewer
from
the
radical
point
of
view
--
an
enterprise
*NL*
the
less
difficult
as
she
knew
perfectly
in
advance
what
her
opinions
*NL*
would
be
and
to
how
many
objections
most
European
institutions
lay
*NL*
open
.
When
she
heard
that
Isabel
was
coming
she
wished
to
start
at
once
;
*NL*
thinking
,
naturally
,
that
it
would
be
delightful
the
two
should
travel
*NL*
together
.
She
had
been
obliged
,
however
,
to
postpone
this
enterprise
.
*NL*
She
thought
Isabel
a
glorious
creature
,
and
had
spoken
of
her
covertly
*NL*
in
some
of
her
letters
,
though
she
never
mentioned
the
fact
to
her
*NL*
friend
,
who
would
not
have
taken
pleasure
in
it
and
was
not
a
regular
*NL*
student
of
the
Interviewer
.
Henrietta
,
for
Isabel
,
was
chiefly
a
proof
*NL*
that
a
woman
might
suffice
to
herself
and
be
happy
.
Her
resources
were
*NL*
of
the
obvious
kind
;
but
even
if
one
had
not
the
journalistic
talent
and
*NL*
a
genius
for
guessing
,
as
Henrietta
said
,
what
the
public
was
going
to
*NL*
want
,
one
was
not
therefore
to
conclude
that
one
had
no
vocation
,
*NL*
no
beneficent
aptitude
of
any
sort
,
and
resign
one
's
self
to
being
*NL*
frivolous
and
hollow
.
Isabel
was
stoutly
determined
not
to
be
hollow
.
If
*NL*
one
should
wait
with
the
right
patience
one
would
find
some
happy
work
*NL*
to
one
's
hand
.
Of
course
,
among
her
theories
,
this
young
lady
was
not
*NL*
without
a
collection
of
views
on
the
subject
of
marriage
.
The
first
on
*NL*
the
list
was
a
conviction
of
the
vulgarity
of
thinking
too
much
of
it
.
*NL*
From
lapsing
into
eagerness
on
this
point
she
earnestly
prayed
she
might
*NL*
be
delivered
;
she
held
that
a
woman
ought
to
be
able
to
live
to
herself
,
*NL*
in
the
absence
of
exceptional
flimsiness
,
and
that
it
was
perfectly
*NL*
possible
to
be
happy
without
the
society
of
a
more
or
less
coarse-minded
*NL*
person
of
another
sex
.
The
girl
's
prayer
was
very
sufficiently
answered
;
*NL*
something
pure
and
proud
that
there
was
in
her
--
something
cold
and
dry
*NL*
an
unappreciated
suitor
with
a
taste
for
analysis
might
have
called
*NL*
it
--
had
hitherto
kept
her
from
any
great
vanity
of
conjecture
on
the
*NL*
article
of
possible
husbands
.
Few
of
the
men
she
saw
seemed
worth
a
*NL*
ruinous
expenditure
,
and
it
made
her
smile
to
think
that
one
of
them
*NL*
should
present
himself
as
an
incentive
to
hope
and
a
reward
of
patience
.
*NL*
Deep
in
her
soul
--
it
was
the
deepest
thing
there
--
lay
a
belief
that
if
*NL*
a
certain
light
should
dawn
she
could
give
herself
completely
;
but
*NL*
this
image
,
on
the
whole
,
was
too
formidable
to
be
attractive
.
Isabel
's
*NL*
thoughts
hovered
about
it
,
but
they
seldom
rested
on
it
long
;
after
a
*NL*
little
it
ended
in
alarms
.
It
often
seemed
to
her
that
she
thought
too
*NL*
much
about
herself
;
you
could
have
made
her
colour
,
any
day
in
the
*NL*
year
,
by
calling
her
a
rank
egoist
.
She
was
always
planning
out
her
*NL*
development
,
desiring
her
perfection
,
observing
her
progress
.
Her
nature
*NL*
had
,
in
her
conceit
,
a
certain
garden-like
quality
,
a
suggestion
of
*NL*
perfume
and
murmuring
boughs
,
of
shady
bowers
and
lengthening
vistas
,
*NL*
which
made
her
feel
that
introspection
was
,
after
all
,
an
exercise
*NL*
in
the
open
air
,
and
that
a
visit
to
the
recesses
of
one
's
spirit
was
*NL*
harmless
when
one
returned
from
it
with
a
lapful
of
roses
.
But
she
was
*NL*
often
reminded
that
there
were
other
gardens
in
the
world
than
those
of
*NL*
her
remarkable
soul
,
and
that
there
were
moreover
a
great
many
places
*NL*
which
were
not
gardens
at
all
--
only
dusky
pestiferous
tracts
,
planted
*NL*
thick
with
ugliness
and
misery
.
In
the
current
of
that
repaid
curiosity
*NL*
on
which
she
had
lately
been
floating
,
which
had
conveyed
her
to
this
*NL*
beautiful
old
England
and
might
carry
her
much
further
still
,
she
often
*NL*
checked
herself
with
the
thought
of
the
thousands
of
people
who
were
*NL*
less
happy
than
herself
--
a
thought
which
for
the
moment
made
her
fine
,
*NL*
full
consciousness
appear
a
kind
of
immodesty
.
What
should
one
do
with
*NL*
the
misery
of
the
world
in
a
scheme
of
the
agreeable
for
one
's
self
?
It
*NL*
must
be
confessed
that
this
question
never
held
her
long
.
She
was
too
*NL*
young
,
too
impatient
to
live
,
too
unacquainted
with
pain
.
She
always
*NL*
returned
to
her
theory
that
a
young
woman
whom
after
all
every
one
*NL*
thought
clever
should
begin
by
getting
a
general
impression
of
life
.
*NL*
This
impression
was
necessary
to
prevent
mistakes
,
and
after
it
should
*NL*
be
secured
she
might
make
the
unfortunate
condition
of
others
a
subject
*NL*
of
special
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
England
was
a
revelation
to
her
,
and
she
found
herself
as
diverted
as
a
*NL*
child
at
a
pantomime
.
In
her
infantine
excursions
to
Europe
she
had
*NL*
seen
only
the
Continent
,
and
seen
it
from
the
nursery
window
;
Paris
,
not
*NL*
London
,
was
her
father
's
Mecca
,
and
into
many
of
his
interests
there
his
*NL*
children
had
naturally
not
entered
.
The
images
of
that
time
moreover
had
*NL*
grown
faint
and
remote
,
and
the
old-world
quality
in
everything
that
*NL*
she
now
saw
had
all
the
charm
of
strangeness
.
Her
uncle
's
house
seemed
a
*NL*
picture
made
real
;
no
refinement
of
the
agreeable
was
lost
upon
*NL*
Isabel
;
the
rich
perfection
of
Gardencourt
at
once
revealed
a
world
and
*NL*
gratified
a
need
.
The
large
,
low
rooms
,
with
brown
ceilings
and
dusky
*NL*
corners
,
the
deep
embrasures
and
curious
casements
,
the
quiet
light
on
*NL*
dark
,
polished
panels
,
the
deep
greenness
outside
,
that
seemed
always
*NL*
peeping
in
,
the
sense
of
well-ordered
privacy
in
the
centre
of
a
*NL*
``
property
''
--
a
place
where
sounds
were
felicitously
accidental
,
where
*NL*
the
tread
was
muffed
by
the
earth
itself
and
in
the
thick
mild
air
all
*NL*
friction
dropped
out
of
contact
and
all
shrillness
out
of
talk
--
these
*NL*
things
were
much
to
the
taste
of
our
young
lady
,
whose
taste
played
a
*NL*
considerable
part
in
her
emotions
.
She
formed
a
fast
friendship
with
her
*NL*
uncle
,
and
often
sat
by
his
chair
when
he
had
had
it
moved
out
to
the
*NL*
lawn
.
He
passed
hours
in
the
open
air
,
sitting
with
folded
hands
like
*NL*
a
placid
,
homely
household
god
,
a
god
of
service
,
who
had
done
his
work
*NL*
and
received
his
wages
and
was
trying
to
grow
used
to
weeks
and
months
*NL*
made
up
only
of
off-days
.
Isabel
amused
him
more
than
she
suspected
--
the
*NL*
effect
she
produced
upon
people
was
often
different
from
what
she
*NL*
supposed
--
and
he
frequently
gave
himself
the
pleasure
of
making
her
*NL*
chatter
.
It
was
by
this
term
that
he
qualified
her
conversation
,
which
*NL*
had
much
of
the
``
point
''
observable
in
that
of
the
young
ladies
of
her
*NL*
country
,
to
whom
the
ear
of
the
world
is
more
directly
presented
than
to
*NL*
their
sisters
in
other
lands
.
Like
the
mass
of
American
girls
Isabel
had
*NL*
been
encouraged
to
express
herself
;
her
remarks
had
been
attended
*NL*
to
;
she
had
been
expected
to
have
emotions
and
opinions
.
Many
of
her
*NL*
opinions
had
doubtless
but
a
slender
value
,
many
of
her
emotions
passed
*NL*
away
in
the
utterance
;
but
they
had
left
a
trace
in
giving
her
the
habit
*NL*
of
seeming
at
least
to
feel
and
think
,
and
in
imparting
moreover
to
*NL*
her
words
when
she
was
really
moved
that
prompt
vividness
which
so
many
*NL*
people
had
regarded
as
a
sign
of
superiority
.
Mr.
Touchett
used
to
think
*NL*
that
she
reminded
him
of
his
wife
when
his
wife
was
in
her
teens
.
It
was
*NL*
because
she
was
fresh
and
natural
and
quick
to
understand
,
to
speak
--
so
*NL*
many
characteristics
of
her
niece
--
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
.
He
never
expressed
this
analogy
to
the
girl
herself
,
however
;
*NL*
for
if
Mrs.
Touchett
had
once
been
like
Isabel
,
Isabel
was
not
at
all
*NL*
like
Mrs.
Touchett
.
The
old
man
was
full
of
kindness
for
her
;
it
was
a
*NL*
long
time
,
as
he
said
,
since
they
had
had
any
young
life
in
the
house
;
*NL*
and
our
rustling
,
quickly-moving
,
clear-voiced
heroine
was
as
agreeable
*NL*
to
his
sense
as
the
sound
of
flowing
water
.
He
wanted
to
do
something
*NL*
for
her
and
wished
she
would
ask
it
of
him
.
She
would
ask
nothing
but
*NL*
questions
;
it
is
true
that
of
these
she
asked
a
quantity
.
Her
uncle
had
*NL*
a
great
fund
of
answers
,
though
her
pressure
sometimes
came
in
forms
*NL*
that
puzzled
him
.
She
questioned
him
immensely
about
England
,
about
the
*NL*
British
constitution
,
the
English
character
,
the
state
of
politics
,
*NL*
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
royal
family
,
the
peculiarities
of
the
*NL*
aristocracy
,
the
way
of
living
and
thinking
of
his
neighbours
;
and
in
*NL*
begging
to
be
enlightened
on
these
points
she
usually
enquired
whether
*NL*
they
corresponded
with
the
descriptions
in
the
books
.
The
old
man
always
*NL*
looked
at
her
a
little
with
his
fine
dry
smile
while
he
smoothed
down
*NL*
the
shawl
spread
across
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
books
?
''
he
once
said
;
``
well
,
I
do
n't
know
much
about
the
books
.
You
*NL*
must
ask
Ralph
about
that
.
I
've
always
ascertained
for
myself
--
got
my
*NL*
information
in
the
natural
form
.
I
never
asked
many
questions
even
;
*NL*
I
just
kept
quiet
and
took
notice
.
Of
course
I
've
had
very
good
*NL*
opportunities
--
better
than
what
a
young
lady
would
naturally
have
.
I
'm
*NL*
of
an
inquisitive
disposition
,
though
you
might
n't
think
it
if
you
were
*NL*
to
watch
me
:
however
much
you
might
watch
me
I
should
be
watching
you
*NL*
more
.
I
've
been
watching
these
people
for
upwards
of
thirty-five
years
,
*NL*
and
I
do
n't
hesitate
to
say
that
I
've
acquired
considerable
information
.
*NL*
It
's
a
very
fine
country
on
the
whole
--
finer
perhaps
than
what
we
give
*NL*
it
credit
for
on
the
other
side
.
Several
improvements
I
should
like
to
*NL*
see
introduced
;
but
the
necessity
of
them
does
n't
seem
to
be
generally
*NL*
felt
as
yet
.
When
the
necessity
of
a
thing
is
generally
felt
they
*NL*
usually
manage
to
accomplish
it
;
but
they
seem
to
feel
pretty
*NL*
comfortable
about
waiting
till
then
.
I
certainly
feel
more
at
home
among
*NL*
them
than
I
expected
to
when
I
first
came
over
;
I
suppose
it
's
because
*NL*
I
've
had
a
considerable
degree
of
success
.
When
you
're
successful
you
*NL*
naturally
feel
more
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
that
if
I
'm
successful
I
shall
feel
at
home
?
''
Isabel
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
it
very
probable
,
and
you
certainly
will
be
successful
.
*NL*
They
like
American
young
ladies
very
much
over
here
;
they
show
them
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
kindness
.
But
you
must
n't
feel
too
much
at
home
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
by
no
means
sure
it
will
satisfy
me
,
''
Isabel
judicially
*NL*
emphasised
.
``
I
like
the
place
very
much
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
I
shall
like
*NL*
the
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
people
are
very
good
people
;
especially
if
you
like
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
doubt
they
're
good
,
''
Isabel
rejoined
;
``
but
are
they
pleasant
*NL*
in
society
?
They
wo
n't
rob
me
nor
beat
me
;
but
will
they
make
themselves
*NL*
agreeable
to
me
?
That
's
what
I
like
people
to
do
.
I
do
n't
hesitate
to
*NL*
say
so
,
because
I
always
appreciate
it
.
I
do
n't
believe
they
're
very
*NL*
nice
to
girls
;
they
're
not
nice
to
them
in
the
novels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
the
novels
,
''
said
Mr.
Touchett
.
``
I
believe
the
*NL*
novels
have
a
great
deal
but
I
do
n't
suppose
they
're
very
accurate
.
*NL*
We
once
had
a
lady
who
wrote
novels
staying
here
;
she
was
a
friend
*NL*
of
Ralph
's
and
he
asked
her
down
.
She
was
very
positive
,
quite
up
to
*NL*
everything
;
but
she
was
not
the
sort
of
person
you
could
depend
on
*NL*
for
evidence
.
Too
free
a
fancy
--
I
suppose
that
was
it
.
She
afterwards
*NL*
published
a
work
of
fiction
in
which
she
was
understood
to
have
given
*NL*
a
representation
--
something
in
the
nature
of
a
caricature
,
as
you
might
*NL*
say
--
of
my
unworthy
self
.
I
did
n't
read
it
,
but
Ralph
just
handed
me
*NL*
the
book
with
the
principal
passages
marked
.
It
was
understood
to
be
*NL*
a
description
of
my
conversation
;
American
peculiarities
,
nasal
twang
,
*NL*
Yankee
notions
,
stars
and
stripes
.
Well
,
it
was
not
at
all
accurate
;
*NL*
she
could
n't
have
listened
very
attentively
.
I
had
no
objection
to
her
*NL*
giving
a
report
of
my
conversation
,
if
she
liked
but
I
did
n't
like
the
*NL*
idea
that
she
had
n't
taken
the
trouble
to
listen
to
it
.
Of
course
I
talk
*NL*
like
an
American
--
I
ca
n't
talk
like
a
Hottentot
.
However
I
talk
,
I
've
*NL*
made
them
understand
me
pretty
well
over
here
.
But
I
do
n't
talk
like
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
in
that
lady
's
novel
.
He
was
n't
an
American
;
we
would
n't
*NL*
have
him
over
there
at
any
price
.
I
just
mention
that
fact
to
show
you
*NL*
that
they
're
not
always
accurate
.
Of
course
,
as
I
've
no
daughters
,
*NL*
and
as
Mrs.
Touchett
resides
in
Florence
,
I
have
n't
had
much
chance
*NL*
to
notice
about
the
young
ladies
.
It
sometimes
appears
as
if
the
young
*NL*
women
in
the
lower
class
were
not
very
well
treated
;
but
I
guess
their
*NL*
position
is
better
in
the
upper
and
even
to
some
extent
in
the
middle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
,
''
Isabel
exclaimed
;
``
how
many
classes
have
they
?
About
fifty
,
*NL*
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
that
I
ever
counted
them
.
I
never
took
much
notice
*NL*
of
the
classes
.
That
's
the
advantage
of
being
an
American
here
;
you
*NL*
do
n't
belong
to
any
class
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
Imagine
one
's
belonging
to
an
English
class
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
guess
some
of
them
are
pretty
comfortable
--
especially
towards
*NL*
the
top
.
But
for
me
there
are
only
two
classes
:
the
people
I
trust
and
*NL*
the
people
I
do
n't
.
Of
those
two
,
my
dear
Isabel
,
you
belong
to
the
*NL*
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
much
obliged
to
you
,
''
said
the
girl
quickly
.
Her
way
of
taking
*NL*
compliments
seemed
sometimes
rather
dry
;
she
got
rid
of
them
as
rapidly
*NL*
as
possible
.
But
as
regards
this
she
was
sometimes
misjudged
;
she
was
*NL*
thought
insensible
to
them
,
whereas
in
fact
she
was
simply
unwilling
to
*NL*
show
how
infinitely
they
pleased
her
.
To
show
that
was
to
show
too
much
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
the
English
are
very
conventional
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
got
everything
pretty
well
fixed
,
''
Mr.
Touchett
admitted
.
``
It
's
*NL*
all
settled
beforehand
--
they
do
n't
leave
it
to
the
last
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
to
have
everything
settled
beforehand
,
''
said
the
girl
.
``
I
*NL*
like
more
unexpectedness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
uncle
seemed
amused
at
her
distinctness
of
preference
.
``
Well
,
it
's
*NL*
settled
beforehand
that
you
'll
have
great
success
,
''
he
rejoined
.
``
I
*NL*
suppose
you
'll
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
have
success
if
they
're
too
stupidly
conventional
.
I
'm
not
*NL*
in
the
least
stupidly
conventional
.
I
'm
just
the
contrary

That
's
what
*NL*
they
wo
n't
like

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
you
're
all
wrong

''
said
the
old
man
.
``
You
ca
n't
tell
what
*NL*
they
'll
like

They
're
very
inconsistent
;
that
's
their
principal
*NL*
interest

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well
,
''
said
Isabel
,
standing
before
her
uncle
with
her
hands
*NL*
clasped
about
the
belt
of
her
black
dress
and
looking
up
and
down
the

lawn

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
amused
themselves
,
time
and
again
,
with
talking
of
the
attitude
*NL*
of
the
British
public
as
if
the
young
lady
had
been
in
a
position
to
*NL*
appeal
to
it
;
but
in
fact
the
British
public
remained
for
the
present
*NL*
profoundly
indifferent
to
Miss
Isabel
Archer
,
whose
fortune
had
dropped
*NL*
her
,
as
her
cousin
said
,
into
the
dullest
house
in
England
.
Her
gouty
*NL*
uncle
received
very
little
company
,
and
Mrs.
Touchett
,
not
having
*NL*
cultivated
relations
with
her
husband
's
neighbours
,
was
not
warranted
*NL*
in
expecting
visits
from
them
.
She
had
,
however
,
a
peculiar
taste
;
she
*NL*
liked
to
receive
cards
.
For
what
is
usually
called
social
intercourse
*NL*
she
had
very
little
relish
;
but
nothing
pleased
her
more
than
to
find
*NL*
her
hall-table
whitened
with
oblong
morsels
of
symbolic
pasteboard
.
She
*NL*
flattered
herself
that
she
was
a
very
just
woman
,
and
had
mastered
the
*NL*
sovereign
truth
that
nothing
in
this
world
is
got
for
nothing
.
She
had
*NL*
played
no
social
part
as
mistress
of
Gardencourt
,
and
it
was
not
to
be
*NL*
supposed
that
,
in
the
surrounding
country
,
a
minute
account
should
be
*NL*
kept
of
her
comings
and
goings
.
But
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
she
*NL*
did
not
feel
it
to
be
wrong
that
so
little
notice
was
taken
of
them
and
*NL*
that
her
failure
-LRB-
really
very
gratuitous
-RRB-
to
make
herself
important
in
*NL*
the
neighbourhood
had
not
much
to
do
with
the
acrimony
of
her
allusions
*NL*
to
her
husband
's
adopted
country
.
Isabel
presently
found
herself
in
the
*NL*
singular
situation
of
defending
the
British
constitution
against
her
*NL*
aunt
;
Mrs.
Touchett
having
formed
the
habit
of
sticking
pins
into
this
*NL*
venerable
instrument
.
Isabel
always
felt
an
impulse
to
pull
out
the
*NL*
pins
;
not
that
she
imagined
they
inflicted
any
damage
on
the
tough
old
*NL*
parchment
,
but
because
it
seemed
to
her
her
aunt
might
make
better
use
*NL*
of
her
sharpness
.
She
was
very
critical
herself
--
it
was
incidental
to
*NL*
her
age
,
her
sex
and
her
nationality
;
but
she
was
very
sentimental
as
*NL*
well
,
and
there
was
something
in
Mrs.
Touchett
's
dryness
that
set
her
*NL*
own
moral
fountains
flowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
what
's
your
point
of
view
?
''
she
asked
of
her
aunt
.
``
When
you
*NL*
criticise
everything
here
you
should
have
a
point
of
view
.
Yours
does
n't
*NL*
seem
to
be
American
--
you
thought
everything
over
there
so
disagreeable
.
*NL*
When
I
criticise
I
have
mine
;
it
's
thoroughly
American
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
young
lady
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
,
``
there
are
as
many
points
of
*NL*
view
in
the
world
as
there
are
people
of
sense
to
take
them
.
You
may
*NL*
say
that
does
n't
make
them
very
numerous
!
American
?
Never
in
the
world
;
*NL*
that
's
shockingly
narrow
.
My
point
of
view
,
thank
God
,
is
personal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
thought
this
a
better
answer
than
she
admitted
;
it
was
a
*NL*
tolerable
description
of
her
own
manner
of
judging
,
but
it
would
not
*NL*
have
sounded
well
for
her
to
say
so
.
On
the
lips
of
a
person
less
*NL*
advanced
in
life
and
less
enlightened
by
experience
than
Mrs.
Touchett
*NL*
such
a
declaration
would
savour
of
immodesty
,
even
of
arrogance
.
She
*NL*
risked
it
nevertheless
in
talking
with
Ralph
,
with
whom
she
talked
a
*NL*
great
deal
and
with
whom
her
conversation
was
of
a
sort
that
gave
a
*NL*
large
licence
to
extravagance
.
Her
cousin
used
,
as
the
phrase
is
,
to
*NL*
chaff
her
;
he
very
soon
established
with
her
a
reputation
for
treating
*NL*
everything
as
a
joke
,
and
he
was
not
a
man
to
neglect
the
privileges
*NL*
such
a
reputation
conferred
.
She
accused
him
of
an
odious
want
of
*NL*
seriousness
,
of
laughing
at
all
things
,
beginning
with
himself
.
Such
*NL*
slender
faculty
of
reverence
as
he
possessed
centred
wholly
upon
his
*NL*
father
;
for
the
rest
,
he
exercised
his
wit
indifferently
upon
his
*NL*
father
's
son
,
this
gentleman
's
weak
lungs
,
his
useless
life
,
his
*NL*
fantastic
mother
,
his
friends
-LRB-
Lord
Warburton
in
especial
-RRB-
,
his
adopted
,
*NL*
and
his
native
country
,
his
charming
new-found
cousin
.
``
I
keep
a
band
*NL*
of
music
in
my
ante-room
,
''
he
said
once
to
her
.
``
It
has
orders
to
play
*NL*
without
stopping
;
it
renders
me
two
excellent
services
.
It
keeps
the
*NL*
sounds
of
the
world
from
reaching
the
private
apartments
,
and
it
makes
*NL*
the
world
think
that
dancing
's
going
on
within
.
''
It
was
dance-music
*NL*
indeed
that
you
usually
heard
when
you
came
within
ear-shot
of
Ralph
's
*NL*
band
;
the
liveliest
waltzes
seemed
to
float
upon
the
air
.
Isabel
often
*NL*
found
herself
irritated
by
this
perpetual
fiddling
;
she
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
pass
through
the
ante-room
,
as
her
cousin
called
it
,
and
enter
the
*NL*
private
apartments
.
It
mattered
little
that
he
had
assured
her
they
were
*NL*
a
very
dismal
place
;
she
would
have
been
glad
to
undertake
to
sweep
them
*NL*
and
set
them
in
order
.
It
was
but
half-hospitality
to
let
her
remain
*NL*
outside
;
to
punish
him
for
which
Isabel
administered
innumerable
taps
*NL*
with
the
ferule
of
her
straight
young
wit
.
It
must
be
said
that
her
wit
*NL*
was
exercised
to
a
large
extent
in
self-defence
,
for
her
cousin
amused
*NL*
himself
with
calling
her
``
Columbia
''
and
accusing
her
of
a
patriotism
so
*NL*
heated
that
it
scorched
.
He
drew
a
caricature
of
her
in
which
she
was
*NL*
represented
as
a
very
pretty
young
woman
dressed
,
on
the
lines
of
the
*NL*
prevailing
fashion
,
in
the
folds
of
the
national
banner
.
Isabel
's
chief
*NL*
dread
in
life
at
this
period
of
her
development
was
that
she
should
*NL*
appear
narrow-minded
;
what
she
feared
next
afterwards
was
that
she
*NL*
should
really
be
so
.
But
she
nevertheless
made
no
scruple
of
abounding
*NL*
in
her
cousin
's
sense
and
pretending
to
sigh
for
the
charms
of
her
*NL*
native
land
.
She
would
be
as
American
as
it
pleased
him
to
regard
her
,
*NL*
and
if
he
chose
to
laugh
at
her
she
would
give
him
plenty
of
occupation
.
*NL*
She
defended
England
against
his
mother
,
but
when
Ralph
sang
its
praises
*NL*
on
purpose
,
as
she
said
,
to
work
her
up
,
she
found
herself
able
to
*NL*
differ
from
him
on
a
variety
of
points
.
In
fact
,
the
quality
of
this
*NL*
small
ripe
country
seemed
as
sweet
to
her
as
the
taste
of
an
October
*NL*
pear
;
and
her
satisfaction
was
at
the
root
of
the
good
spirits
which
*NL*
enabled
her
to
take
her
cousin
's
chaff
and
return
it
in
kind
.
If
her
*NL*
good-humour
flagged
at
moments
it
was
not
because
she
thought
herself
*NL*
ill-used
,
but
because
she
suddenly
felt
sorry
for
Ralph
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
her
he
was
talking
as
a
blind
and
had
little
heart
in
what
he
said
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
's
the
matter
with
you
,
''
she
observed
to
him
once
;
``
but
I
*NL*
suspect
you
're
a
great
humbug
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
your
privilege
,
''
Ralph
answered
,
who
had
not
been
used
to
being
*NL*
so
crudely
addressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
care
for
;
I
do
n't
think
you
care
for
anything
.
*NL*
You
do
n't
really
care
for
England
when
you
praise
it
;
you
do
n't
care
for
*NL*
America
even
when
you
pretend
to
abuse
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
care
for
nothing
but
you
,
dear
cousin
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
believe
even
that
,
I
should
be
very
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well
,
I
should
hope
so
!
''
the
young
man
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
might
have
believed
it
and
not
have
been
far
from
the
truth
.
He
*NL*
thought
a
great
deal
about
her
;
she
was
constantly
present
to
his
mind
.
*NL*
At
a
time
when
his
thoughts
had
been
a
good
deal
of
a
burden
to
him
her
*NL*
sudden
arrival
,
which
promised
nothing
and
was
an
open-handed
gift
of
*NL*
fate
,
had
refreshed
and
quickened
them
,
given
them
wings
and
something
*NL*
to
fly
for
.
Poor
Ralph
had
been
for
many
weeks
steeped
in
melancholy
;
*NL*
his
outlook
,
habitually
sombre
,
lay
under
the
shadow
of
a
deeper
cloud
.
*NL*
He
had
grown
anxious
about
his
father
,
whose
gout
,
hitherto
confined
to
*NL*
his
legs
,
had
begun
to
ascend
into
regions
more
vital
.
The
old
man
had
*NL*
been
gravely
ill
in
the
spring
,
and
the
doctors
had
whispered
to
*NL*
Ralph
that
another
attack
would
be
less
easy
to
deal
with
.
Just
now
*NL*
he
appeared
disburdened
of
pain
,
but
Ralph
could
not
rid
himself
of
a
*NL*
suspicion
that
this
was
a
subterfuge
of
the
enemy
,
who
was
waiting
to
*NL*
take
him
off
his
guard
.
If
the
manoeuvre
should
succeed
there
would
be
*NL*
little
hope
of
any
great
resistance
.
Ralph
had
always
taken
for
granted
*NL*
that
his
father
would
survive
him
--
that
his
own
name
would
be
the
first
*NL*
grimly
called
.
The
father
and
son
had
been
close
companions
,
and
the
*NL*
idea
of
being
left
alone
with
the
remnant
of
a
tasteless
life
on
his
*NL*
hands
was
not
gratifying
to
the
young
man
,
who
had
always
and
tacitly
*NL*
counted
upon
his
elder
's
help
in
making
the
best
of
a
poor
business
.
*NL*
At
the
prospect
of
losing
his
great
motive
Ralph
lost
indeed
his
one
*NL*
inspiration
.
If
they
might
die
at
the
same
time
it
would
be
all
very
*NL*
well
;
but
without
the
encouragement
of
his
father
's
society
he
should
*NL*
barely
have
patience
to
await
his
own
turn
.
He
had
not
the
incentive
of
*NL*
feeling
that
he
was
indispensable
to
his
mother
;
it
was
a
rule
with
his
*NL*
mother
to
have
no
regrets
.
He
bethought
himself
of
course
that
it
had
*NL*
been
a
small
kindness
to
his
father
to
wish
that
,
of
the
two
,
the
active
*NL*
rather
than
the
passive
party
should
know
the
felt
wound
;
he
remembered
*NL*
that
the
old
man
had
always
treated
his
own
forecast
of
an
early
end
as
*NL*
a
clever
fallacy
,
which
he
should
be
delighted
to
discredit
so
far
as
*NL*
he
might
by
dying
first
.
But
of
the
two
triumphs
,
that
of
refuting
a
*NL*
sophistical
son
and
that
of
holding
on
a
while
longer
to
a
state
of
*NL*
being
which
,
with
all
abatements
,
he
enjoyed
,
Ralph
deemed
it
no
sin
to
*NL*
hope
the
latter
might
be
vouchsafed
to
Mr.
Touchett
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
nice
questions
,
but
Isabel
's
arrival
put
a
stop
to
his
*NL*
puzzling
over
them
.
It
even
suggested
there
might
be
a
compensation
for
*NL*
the
intolerable
ennui
of
surviving
his
genial
sire
.
He
wondered
whether
*NL*
he
were
harbouring
``
love
''
for
this
spontaneous
young
woman
from
Albany
;
*NL*
but
he
judged
that
on
the
whole
he
was
not
.
After
he
had
known
her
for
*NL*
a
week
he
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
this
,
and
every
day
he
felt
a
little
*NL*
more
sure
.
Lord
Warburton
had
been
right
about
her
;
she
was
a
really
*NL*
interesting
little
figure
.
Ralph
wondered
how
their
neighbour
had
*NL*
found
it
out
so
soon
;
and
then
he
said
it
was
only
another
proof
of
his
*NL*
friend
's
high
abilities
,
which
he
had
always
greatly
admired
.
If
his
*NL*
cousin
were
to
be
nothing
more
than
an
entertainment
to
him
,
Ralph
was
*NL*
conscious
she
was
an
entertainment
of
a
high
order
.
``
A
character
like
*NL*
that
,
''
he
said
to
himself
--
``
a
real
little
passionate
force
to
see
at
*NL*
play
is
the
finest
thing
in
nature
.
It
's
finer
than
the
finest
work
*NL*
of
art
--
than
a
Greek
bas-relief
,
than
a
great
Titian
,
than
a
Gothic
*NL*
cathedral
.
It
's
very
pleasant
to
be
so
well
treated
where
one
had
least
*NL*
looked
for
it
.
I
had
never
been
more
blue
,
more
bored
,
than
for
a
week
*NL*
before
she
came
;
I
had
never
expected
less
that
anything
pleasant
would
*NL*
happen
.
Suddenly
I
receive
a
Titian
,
by
the
post
,
to
hang
on
my
wall
--
a
*NL*
Greek
bas-relief
to
stick
over
my
chimney-piece
.
The
key
of
a
beautiful
*NL*
edifice
is
thrust
into
my
hand
,
and
I
'm
told
to
walk
in
and
admire
.
My
*NL*
poor
boy
,
you
've
been
sadly
ungrateful
,
and
now
you
had
better
keep
very
*NL*
quiet
and
never
grumble
again
.
''
The
sentiment
of
these
reflexions
was
*NL*
very
just
;
but
it
was
not
exactly
true
that
Ralph
Touchett
had
had
a
key
*NL*
put
into
his
hand
.
His
cousin
was
a
very
brilliant
girl
,
who
would
take
,
*NL*
as
he
said
,
a
good
deal
of
knowing
;
but
she
needed
the
knowing
,
and
his
*NL*
attitude
with
regard
to
her
,
though
it
was
contemplative
and
critical
,
*NL*
was
not
judicial
.
He
surveyed
the
edifice
from
the
outside
and
admired
*NL*
it
greatly
;
he
looked
in
at
the
windows
and
received
an
impression
of
*NL*
proportions
equally
fair
.
But
he
felt
that
he
saw
it
only
by
glimpses
*NL*
and
that
he
had
not
yet
stood
under
the
roof
.
The
door
was
fastened
,
and
*NL*
though
he
had
keys
in
his
pocket
he
had
a
conviction
that
none
of
them
*NL*
would
fit
.
She
was
intelligent
and
generous
;
it
was
a
fine
free
nature
;
*NL*
but
what
was
she
going
to
do
with
herself
?
This
question
was
irregular
,
*NL*
for
with
most
women
one
had
no
occasion
to
ask
it
.
Most
women
did
*NL*
with
themselves
nothing
at
all
;
they
waited
,
in
attitudes
more
or
less
*NL*
gracefully
passive
,
for
a
man
to
come
that
way
and
furnish
them
with
*NL*
a
destiny
.
Isabel
's
originality
was
that
she
gave
one
an
impression
of
*NL*
having
intentions
of
her
own
.
``
Whenever
she
executes
them
,
''
said
Ralph
,
*NL*
``
may
I
be
there
to
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
devolved
upon
him
of
course
to
do
the
honours
of
the
place
.
Mr.
*NL*
Touchett
was
confined
to
his
chair
,
and
his
wife
's
position
was
that
of
*NL*
rather
a
grim
visitor
;
so
that
in
the
line
of
conduct
that
opened
itself
*NL*
to
Ralph
duty
and
inclination
were
harmoniously
mixed
.
He
was
not
a
*NL*
great
walker
,
but
he
strolled
about
the
grounds
with
his
cousin
--
a
*NL*
pastime
for
which
the
weather
remained
favourable
with
a
persistency
not
*NL*
allowed
for
in
Isabel
's
somewhat
lugubrious
prevision
of
the
climate
;
*NL*
and
in
the
long
afternoons
,
of
which
the
length
was
but
the
measure
of
*NL*
her
gratified
eagerness
,
they
took
a
boat
on
the
river
,
the
dear
little
*NL*
river
,
as
Isabel
called
it
,
where
the
opposite
shore
seemed
still
a
*NL*
part
of
the
foreground
of
the
landscape
;
or
drove
over
the
country
in
a
*NL*
phaeton
--
a
low
,
capacious
,
thick-wheeled
phaeton
formerly
much
used
by
*NL*
Mr.
Touchett
,
but
which
he
had
now
ceased
to
enjoy
.
Isabel
enjoyed
it
*NL*
largely
and
,
handling
the
reins
in
a
manner
which
approved
itself
to
*NL*
the
groom
as
``
knowing
,
''
was
never
weary
of
driving
her
uncle
's
capital
*NL*
horses
through
winding
lanes
and
byways
full
of
the
rural
incidents
she
*NL*
had
confidently
expected
to
find
;
past
cottages
thatched
and
timbered
,
*NL*
past
ale-houses
latticed
and
sanded
,
past
patches
of
ancient
common
and
*NL*
glimpses
of
empty
parks
,
between
hedgerows
made
thick
by
midsummer
.
When
*NL*
they
reached
home
they
usually
found
tea
had
been
served
on
the
lawn
*NL*
and
that
Mrs.
Touchett
had
not
shrunk
from
the
extremity
of
handing
her
*NL*
husband
his
cup
.
But
the
two
for
the
most
part
sat
silent
;
the
old
*NL*
man
with
his
head
back
and
his
eyes
closed
,
his
wife
occupied
with
her
*NL*
knitting
and
wearing
that
appearance
of
rare
profundity
with
which
some
*NL*
ladies
consider
the
movement
of
their
needles
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
however
,
a
visitor
had
arrived
.
The
two
young
persons
,
after
*NL*
spending
an
hour
on
the
river
,
strolled
back
to
the
house
and
perceived
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
sitting
under
the
trees
and
engaged
in
conversation
,
of
*NL*
which
even
at
a
distance
the
desultory
character
was
appreciable
,
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
.
He
had
driven
over
from
his
own
place
with
a
portmanteau
*NL*
and
had
asked
,
as
the
father
and
son
often
invited
him
to
do
,
for
a
*NL*
dinner
and
a
lodging
.
Isabel
,
seeing
him
for
half
an
hour
on
the
day
of
*NL*
her
arrival
,
had
discovered
in
this
brief
space
that
she
liked
him
;
he
*NL*
had
indeed
rather
sharply
registered
himself
on
her
fine
sense
and
*NL*
she
had
thought
of
him
several
times
.
She
had
hoped
she
should
see
him
*NL*
again
--
hoped
too
that
she
should
see
a
few
others
.
Gardencourt
was
not
*NL*
dull
;
the
place
itself
was
sovereign
,
her
uncle
was
more
and
more
a
*NL*
sort
of
golden
grandfather
,
and
Ralph
was
unlike
any
cousin
she
had
*NL*
ever
encountered
--
her
idea
of
cousins
having
tended
to
gloom
.
Then
her
*NL*
impressions
were
still
so
fresh
and
so
quickly
renewed
that
there
was
as
*NL*
yet
hardly
a
hint
of
vacancy
in
the
view
.
But
Isabel
had
need
to
remind
*NL*
herself
that
she
was
interested
in
human
nature
and
that
her
foremost
*NL*
hope
in
coming
abroad
had
been
that
she
should
see
a
great
many
people
.
*NL*
When
Ralph
said
to
her
,
as
he
had
done
several
times
,
``
I
wonder
you
find
*NL*
this
endurable
;
you
ought
to
see
some
of
the
neighbours
and
some
of
*NL*
our
friends
,
because
we
have
really
got
a
few
,
though
you
would
never
*NL*
suppose
it
''
--
when
he
offered
to
invite
what
he
called
a
``
lot
of
people
''
*NL*
and
make
her
acquainted
with
English
society
,
she
encouraged
the
*NL*
hospitable
impulse
and
promised
in
advance
to
hurl
herself
into
the
*NL*
fray
.
Little
,
however
,
for
the
present
,
had
come
of
his
offers
,
and
it
*NL*
may
be
confided
to
the
reader
that
if
the
young
man
delayed
to
carry
*NL*
them
out
it
was
because
he
found
the
labour
of
providing
for
his
*NL*
companion
by
no
means
so
severe
as
to
require
extraneous
help
.
Isabel
*NL*
had
spoken
to
him
very
often
about
``
specimens
;
''
it
was
a
word
that
*NL*
played
a
considerable
part
in
her
vocabulary
;
she
had
given
him
to
*NL*
understand
that
she
wished
to
see
English
society
illustrated
by
eminent
*NL*
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
there
's
a
specimen
,
''
he
said
to
her
as
they
walked
up
from
*NL*
the
riverside
and
he
recognised
Lord
Warburton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
specimen
of
what
?
''
asked
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
specimen
of
an
English
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
they
're
all
like
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
;
they
're
not
all
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
favourable
specimen
then
,
''
said
Isabel
;
``
because
I
'm
sure
he
's
*NL*
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
very
nice
.
And
he
's
very
fortunate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fortunate
Lord
Warburton
exchanged
a
handshake
with
our
heroine
*NL*
and
hoped
she
was
very
well
.
``
But
I
need
n't
ask
that
,
''
he
said
,
``
since
*NL*
you
've
been
handling
the
oars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
rowing
a
little
,
''
Isabel
answered
;
``
but
how
should
you
know
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
he
does
n't
row
;
he
's
too
lazy
,
''
said
his
lordship
,
*NL*
indicating
Ralph
Touchett
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
a
good
excuse
for
his
laziness
,
''
Isabel
rejoined
,
lowering
her
*NL*
voice
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
has
a
good
excuse
for
everything
!
''
cried
Lord
Warburton
,
still
*NL*
with
his
sonorous
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
excuse
for
not
rowing
is
that
my
cousin
rows
so
well
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
``
She
does
everything
well
.
She
touches
nothing
that
she
does
n't
adorn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
makes
one
want
to
be
touched
,
Miss
Archer
,
''
Lord
Warburton
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
touched
in
the
right
sense
and
you
'll
never
look
the
worse
for
*NL*
it
,
''
said
Isabel
,
who
,
if
it
pleased
her
to
hear
it
said
that
her
*NL*
accomplishments
were
numerous
,
was
happily
able
to
reflect
that
such
*NL*
complacency
was
not
the
indication
of
a
feeble
mind
,
inasmuch
as
there
*NL*
were
several
things
in
which
she
excelled
.
Her
desire
to
think
well
of
*NL*
herself
had
at
least
the
element
of
humility
that
it
always
needed
to
be
*NL*
supported
by
proof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
not
only
spent
the
night
at
Gardencourt
,
but
he
was
*NL*
persuaded
to
remain
over
the
second
day
;
and
when
the
second
day
was
*NL*
ended
he
determined
to
postpone
his
departure
till
the
morrow
.
During
*NL*
this
period
he
addressed
many
of
his
remarks
to
Isabel
,
who
accepted
*NL*
this
evidence
of
his
esteem
with
a
very
good
grace
.
She
found
herself
*NL*
liking
him
extremely
;
the
first
impression
he
had
made
on
her
had
had
*NL*
weight
,
but
at
the
end
of
an
evening
spent
in
his
society
she
scarce
*NL*
fell
short
of
seeing
him
--
though
quite
without
luridity
--
as
a
hero
*NL*
of
romance
.
She
retired
to
rest
with
a
sense
of
good
fortune
,
with
a
*NL*
quickened
consciousness
of
possible
felicities
.
``
It
's
very
nice
to
know
*NL*
two
such
charming
people
as
those
,
''
she
said
,
meaning
by
``
those
''
her
*NL*
cousin
and
her
cousin
's
friend
.
It
must
be
added
moreover
that
an
*NL*
incident
had
occurred
which
might
have
seemed
to
put
her
good-humour
to
*NL*
the
test
.
Mr.
Touchett
went
to
bed
at
half-past
nine
o'clock
,
but
his
*NL*
wife
remained
in
the
drawing-room
with
the
other
members
of
the
party
.
*NL*
She
prolonged
her
vigil
for
something
less
than
an
hour
,
and
then
,
*NL*
rising
,
observed
to
Isabel
that
it
was
time
they
should
bid
the
*NL*
gentlemen
good-night
.
Isabel
had
as
yet
no
desire
to
go
to
bed
;
the
*NL*
occasion
wore
,
to
her
sense
,
a
festive
character
,
and
feasts
were
not
*NL*
in
the
habit
of
terminating
so
early
.
So
,
without
further
thought
,
she
*NL*
replied
,
very
simply
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Need
I
go
,
dear
aunt
?
I
'll
come
up
in
half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
impossible
I
should
wait
for
you
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
need
n't
wait
!
Ralph
will
light
my
candle
,
''
Isabel
gaily
*NL*
engaged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
light
your
candle
;
do
let
me
light
your
candle
,
Miss
Archer
!
''
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
exclaimed
.
``
Only
I
beg
it
shall
not
be
before
midnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
fixed
her
bright
little
eyes
upon
him
a
moment
and
*NL*
transferred
them
coldly
to
her
niece
.
``
You
ca
n't
stay
alone
with
the
*NL*
gentlemen
.
You
're
not
--
you
're
not
at
your
blest
Albany
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
rose
,
blushing
.
``
I
wish
I
were
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
say
,
mother
!
''
Ralph
broke
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Mrs.
Touchett
!
''
Lord
Warburton
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
make
your
country
,
my
lord
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
said
majestically
.
*NL*
``
I
must
take
it
as
I
find
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
I
stay
with
my
own
cousin
?
''
Isabel
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
aware
that
Lord
Warburton
is
your
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
had
better
go
to
bed
!
''
the
visitor
suggested
.
``
That
will
*NL*
arrange
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
gave
a
little
look
of
despair
and
sat
down
again
.
``
Oh
,
if
*NL*
it
's
necessary
I
'll
stay
up
till
midnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
meanwhile
handed
Isabel
her
candlestick
.
He
had
been
watching
her
;
*NL*
it
had
seemed
to
him
her
temper
was
involved
--
an
accident
that
might
*NL*
be
interesting
.
But
if
he
had
expected
anything
of
a
flare
he
was
*NL*
disappointed
,
for
the
girl
simply
laughed
a
little
,
nodded
good-night
*NL*
and
withdrew
accompanied
by
her
aunt
.
For
himself
he
was
annoyed
at
his
*NL*
mother
,
though
he
thought
she
was
right
.
Above-stairs
the
two
ladies
*NL*
separated
at
Mrs.
Touchett
's
door
.
Isabel
had
said
nothing
on
her
way
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
're
vexed
at
my
interfering
with
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
considered
.
``
I
'm
not
vexed
,
but
I
'm
surprised
--
and
a
good
deal
*NL*
mystified
.
Was
n't
it
proper
I
should
remain
in
the
drawing-room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
least
.
Young
girls
here
--
in
decent
houses
--
do
n't
sit
alone
*NL*
with
the
gentlemen
late
at
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
very
right
to
tell
me
then
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
I
do
n't
understand
*NL*
it
,
but
I
'm
very
glad
to
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
always
tell
you
,
''
her
aunt
answered
,
``
whenever
I
see
you
taking
*NL*
what
seems
to
me
too
much
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
do
;
but
I
do
n't
say
I
shall
always
think
your
remonstrance
just
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
not

You
're
too
fond
of
your
own
ways

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
I
'm
very
fond
of
them

I
always
want
to
know
the

things
one
should
n't
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
as
to
do
them
?

asked
her
aunt

*NL*
``
So
as

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
devoted
to
romantic
effects
Lord
Warburton
ventured
to
*NL*
express
a
hope
that
she
would
come
some
day
and
see
his
house
,
a
very
*NL*
curious
old
place
.
He
extracted
from
Mrs.
Touchett
a
promise
that
she
*NL*
would
bring
her
niece
to
Lockleigh
,
and
Ralph
signified
his
willingness
*NL*
to
attend
the
ladies
if
his
father
should
be
able
to
spare
him
.
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
assured
our
heroine
that
in
the
mean
time
his
sisters
would
*NL*
come
and
see
her
.
She
knew
something
about
his
sisters
,
having
sounded
*NL*
him
,
during
the
hours
they
spent
together
while
he
was
at
Gardencourt
,
*NL*
on
many
points
connected
with
his
family
.
When
Isabel
was
interested
she
*NL*
asked
a
great
many
questions
,
and
as
her
companion
was
a
copious
talker
*NL*
she
urged
him
on
this
occasion
by
no
means
in
vain
.
He
told
her
he
*NL*
had
four
sisters
and
two
brothers
and
had
lost
both
his
parents
.
The
*NL*
brothers
and
sisters
were
very
good
people
--
``
not
particularly
clever
,
*NL*
you
know
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
very
decent
and
pleasant
;
''
and
he
was
so
good
*NL*
as
to
hope
Miss
Archer
might
know
them
well
.
One
of
the
brothers
was
in
*NL*
the
Church
,
settled
in
the
family
living
,
that
of
Lockleigh
,
which
was
*NL*
a
heavy
,
sprawling
parish
,
and
was
an
excellent
fellow
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
thinking
differently
from
himself
on
every
conceivable
topic
.
And
then
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
mentioned
some
of
the
opinions
held
by
his
brother
,
which
*NL*
were
opinions
Isabel
had
often
heard
expressed
and
that
she
supposed
to
*NL*
be
entertained
by
a
considerable
portion
of
the
human
family
.
Many
of
*NL*
them
indeed
she
supposed
she
had
held
herself
,
till
he
assured
her
*NL*
she
was
quite
mistaken
,
that
it
was
really
impossible
,
that
she
had
*NL*
doubtless
imagined
she
entertained
them
,
but
that
she
might
depend
that
,
*NL*
if
she
thought
them
over
a
little
,
she
would
find
there
was
nothing
*NL*
in
them
.
When
she
answered
that
she
had
already
thought
several
of
the
*NL*
questions
involved
over
very
attentively
he
declared
that
she
was
only
*NL*
another
example
of
what
he
had
often
been
struck
with
--
the
fact
that
,
*NL*
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
,
the
Americans
were
the
most
grossly
*NL*
superstitious
.
They
were
rank
Tories
and
bigots
,
every
one
of
them
;
*NL*
there
were
no
conservatives
like
American
conservatives
.
Her
uncle
and
*NL*
her
cousin
were
there
to
prove
it
;
nothing
could
be
more
medieval
than
*NL*
many
of
their
views
;
they
had
ideas
that
people
in
England
nowadays
were
*NL*
ashamed
to
confess
to
;
and
they
had
the
impudence
moreover
,
said
his
*NL*
lordship
,
laughing
,
to
pretend
they
knew
more
about
the
needs
and
*NL*
dangers
of
this
poor
dear
stupid
old
England
than
he
who
was
born
in
it
*NL*
and
owned
a
considerable
slice
of
it
--
the
more
shame
to
him
!
From
all
of
*NL*
which
Isabel
gathered
that
Lord
Warburton
was
a
nobleman
of
the
newest
*NL*
pattern
,
a
reformer
,
a
radical
,
a
contemner
of
ancient
ways
.
His
other
*NL*
brother
,
who
was
in
the
army
in
India
,
was
rather
wild
and
pig-headed
*NL*
and
had
not
been
of
much
use
as
yet
but
to
make
debts
for
Warburton
to
*NL*
pay
--
one
of
the
most
precious
privileges
of
an
elder
brother
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
I
shall
pay
any
more
,
''
said
her
friend
;
``
he
lives
a
monstrous
deal
*NL*
better
than
I
do
,
enjoys
unheard-of
luxuries
and
thinks
himself
a
much
*NL*
finer
gentleman
than
I
.
As
I
'm
a
consistent
radical
I
go
in
only
for
*NL*
equality
;
I
do
n't
go
in
for
the
superiority
of
the
younger
brothers
.
''
*NL*
Two
of
his
four
sisters
,
the
second
and
fourth
,
were
married
,
one
of
*NL*
them
having
done
very
well
,
as
they
said
,
the
other
only
so-so
.
*NL*
The
husband
of
the
elder
,
Lord
Haycock
,
was
a
very
good
fellow
,
but
*NL*
unfortunately
a
horrid
Tory
;
and
his
wife
,
like
all
good
English
wives
,
*NL*
was
worse
than
her
husband
.
The
other
had
espoused
a
smallish
squire
*NL*
in
Norfolk
and
,
though
married
but
the
other
day
,
had
already
five
*NL*
children
.
This
information
and
much
more
Lord
Warburton
imparted
to
his
*NL*
young
American
listener
,
taking
pains
to
make
many
things
clear
and
to
*NL*
lay
bare
to
her
apprehension
the
peculiarities
of
English
life
.
Isabel
*NL*
was
often
amused
at
his
explicitness
and
at
the
small
allowance
he
*NL*
seemed
to
make
either
for
her
own
experience
or
for
her
imagination
.
``
He
*NL*
thinks
I
'm
a
barbarian
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
that
I
've
never
seen
forks
and
*NL*
spoons
;
''
and
she
used
to
ask
him
artless
questions
for
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
hearing
him
answer
seriously
.
Then
when
he
had
fallen
into
the
trap
,
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
you
ca
n't
see
me
in
my
war-paint
and
feathers
,
''
she
*NL*
remarked
;
``
if
I
had
known
how
kind
you
are
to
the
poor
savages
I
would
*NL*
have
brought
over
my
native
costume
!
''
Lord
Warburton
had
travelled
*NL*
through
the
United
States
and
knew
much
more
about
them
than
Isabel
;
he
*NL*
was
so
good
as
to
say
that
America
was
the
most
charming
country
in
the
*NL*
world
,
but
his
recollections
of
it
appeared
to
encourage
the
idea
that
*NL*
Americans
in
England
would
need
to
have
a
great
many
things
explained
*NL*
to
them
.
``
If
I
had
only
had
you
to
explain
things
to
me
in
America
!
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
I
was
rather
puzzled
in
your
country
;
in
fact
I
was
quite
*NL*
bewildered
,
and
the
trouble
was
that
the
explanations
only
puzzled
me
*NL*
more
.
You
know
I
think
they
often
gave
me
the
wrong
ones
on
purpose
;
*NL*
they
're
rather
clever
about
that
over
there
.
But
when
I
explain
you
*NL*
can
trust
me
;
about
what
I
tell
you
there
's
no
mistake
.
''
There
was
no
*NL*
mistake
at
least
about
his
being
very
intelligent
and
cultivated
and
*NL*
knowing
almost
everything
in
the
world
.
Although
he
gave
the
most
*NL*
interesting
and
thrilling
glimpses
Isabel
felt
he
never
did
it
to
*NL*
exhibit
himself
,
and
though
he
had
had
rare
chances
and
had
tumbled
in
,
*NL*
as
she
put
it
,
for
high
prizes
,
he
was
as
far
as
possible
from
making
*NL*
a
merit
of
it
.
He
had
enjoyed
the
best
things
of
life
,
but
they
had
not
*NL*
spoiled
his
sense
of
proportion
.
His
quality
was
a
mixture
of
the
effect
*NL*
of
rich
experience
--
oh
,
so
easily
come
by
!
--
with
a
modesty
at
times
*NL*
almost
boyish
;
the
sweet
and
wholesome
savour
of
which
--
it
was
as
*NL*
agreeable
as
something
tasted
--
lost
nothing
from
the
addition
of
a
tone
*NL*
of
responsible
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
your
specimen
English
gentleman
very
much
,
''
Isabel
said
to
Ralph
*NL*
after
Lord
Warburton
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
him
too
--
I
love
him
well
,
''
Ralph
returned
.
``
But
I
pity
him
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
looked
at
him
askance
.
``
Why
,
that
seems
to
me
his
only
*NL*
fault
--
that
one
ca
n't
pity
him
a
little
.
He
appears
to
have
everything
,
*NL*
to
know
everything
,
to
be
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
in
a
bad
way
!
''
Ralph
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
do
n't
mean
in
health
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
as
to
that
he
's
detestably
sound
.
What
I
mean
is
that
he
's
a
man
*NL*
with
a
great
position
who
's
playing
all
sorts
of
tricks
with
it
.
He
*NL*
does
n't
take
himself
seriously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
regard
himself
as
a
joke
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
worse
;
he
regards
himself
as
an
imposition
--
as
an
abuse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
he
is
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
is
--
though
on
the
whole
I
do
n't
think
so
.
But
in
that
case
*NL*
what
's
more
pitiable
than
a
sentient
,
self-conscious
abuse
planted
by
*NL*
other
hands
,
deeply
rooted
but
aching
with
a
sense
of
its
injustice
?
*NL*
For
me
,
in
his
place
,
I
could
be
as
solemn
as
a
statue
of
Buddha
.
*NL*
He
occupies
a
position
that
appeals
to
my
imagination
.
Great
*NL*
responsibilities
,
great
opportunities
,
great
consideration
,
great
*NL*
wealth
,
great
power
,
a
natural
share
in
the
public
affairs
of
a
great
*NL*
country
.
But
he
's
all
in
a
muddle
about
himself
,
his
position
,
his
*NL*
power
,
and
indeed
about
everything
in
the
world
.
He
's
the
victim
of
a
*NL*
critical
age
;
he
has
ceased
to
believe
in
himself
and
he
does
n't
know
*NL*
what
to
believe
in
.
When
I
attempt
to
tell
him
-LRB-
because
if
I
were
he
I
*NL*
know
very
well
what
I
should
believe
in
-RRB-
he
calls
me
a
pampered
bigot
.
*NL*
I
believe
he
seriously
thinks
me
an
awful
Philistine
;
he
says
I
do
n't
*NL*
understand
my
time
.
I
understand
it
certainly
better
than
he
,
who
*NL*
can
neither
abolish
himself
as
a
nuisance
nor
maintain
himself
as
an
*NL*
institution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
look
very
wretched
,
''
Isabel
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
not
;
though
,
being
a
man
of
a
good
deal
of
charming
taste
,
I
*NL*
think
he
often
has
uncomfortable
hours
.
But
what
is
it
to
say
of
a
being
*NL*
of
his
opportunities
that
he
's
not
miserable
?
Besides
,
I
believe
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
her
cousin
rejoined
,
``
if
he
is
n't
he
ought
to
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
she
spent
an
hour
with
her
uncle
on
the
lawn
,
where
the
*NL*
old
man
sat
,
as
usual
,
with
his
shawl
over
his
legs
and
his
large
cup
*NL*
of
diluted
tea
in
his
hands
.
In
the
course
of
conversation
he
asked
her
*NL*
what
she
thought
of
their
late
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
prompt
.
``
I
think
he
's
charming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
nice
person
,
''
said
Mr.
Touchett
,
``
but
I
do
n't
recommend
you
to
*NL*
fall
in
love
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
do
it
then
;
I
shall
never
fall
in
love
but
on
your
*NL*
recommendation
.
Moreover
,
''
Isabel
added
,
``
my
cousin
gives
me
rather
a
*NL*
sad
account
of
Lord
Warburton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
?
I
do
n't
know
what
there
may
be
to
say
,
but
you
must
*NL*
remember
that
Ralph
must
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks
your
friend
's
too
subversive
--
or
not
subversive
enough
!
I
*NL*
do
n't
quite
understand
which
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
shook
his
head
slowly
,
smiled
and
put
down
his
cup
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
which
either
.
He
goes
very
far
,
but
it
's
quite
possible
he
does
n't
*NL*
go
far
enough
.
He
seems
to
want
to
do
away
with
a
good
many
things
,
but
*NL*
he
seems
to
want
to
remain
himself
.
I
suppose
that
's
natural
,
but
it
's
*NL*
rather
inconsistent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
hope
he
'll
remain
himself
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
If
he
were
to
be
done
*NL*
away
with
his
friends
would
miss
him
sadly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
``
I
guess
he
'll
stay
and
amuse
his
friends
.
*NL*
I
should
certainly
miss
him
very
much
here
at
Gardencourt
.
He
always
*NL*
amuses
me
when
he
comes
over
,
and
I
think
he
amuses
himself
as
well
.
*NL*
There
's
a
considerable
number
like
him
,
round
in
society
;
they
're
very
*NL*
fashionable
just
now
.
I
do
n't
know
what
they
're
trying
to
do
--
whether
*NL*
they
're
trying
to
get
up
a
revolution
.
I
hope
at
any
rate
they
'll
put
it
*NL*
off
till
after
I
'm
gone
.
You
see
they
want
to
disestablish
everything
;
*NL*
but
I
'm
a
pretty
big
landowner
here
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
be
*NL*
disestablished
.
I
would
n't
have
come
over
if
I
had
thought
they
*NL*
were
going
to
behave
like
that
,
''
Mr.
Touchett
went
on
with
expanding
*NL*
hilarity
.
``
I
came
over
because
I
thought
England
was
a
safe
country
.
I
*NL*
call
it
a
regular
fraud
if
they
are
going
to
introduce
any
considerable
*NL*
changes
;
there
'll
be
a
large
number
disappointed
in
that
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
hope
they
'll
make
a
revolution
!
''
Isabel
exclaimed
.
``
I
should
*NL*
delight
in
seeing
a
revolution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
,
''
said
her
uncle
,
with
a
humorous
intention
;
``
I
forget
*NL*
whether
you
're
on
the
side
of
the
old
or
on
the
side
of
the
new

I
've
*NL*
heard
you
take
such
opposite
views

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
on
the
side
of
both
.
I
guess
I
'm
a
little
on
the
side
of
*NL*
everything
.
In
a
revolution
--
after
it
was
well
begun
--
I
think
I
should
*NL*
be
a
high
,
proud
loyalist
.
One
sympathises
more
with
them
,
and
they
've
a
*NL*
chance
to
behave
so
exquisitely
.
I
mean
so
picturesquely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
I
understand
what
you
mean
by
behaving
picturesquely

*NL*
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
do
that
always
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
lovely
man
,
if
I
could
believe
that
!

the
girl
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
,
after
all
,
you
wo
n't
have
the
pleasure
of
going
gracefully
*NL*
to
the
guillotine
here
just
now
,
''
Mr.
Touchett
went
on
.
``
If
you
want
to
*NL*
see
a
big
outbreak
you
must
pay
us
a
long
visit
.
You
see
,
when
you
come
*NL*
to
the
point
it
would
n't
suit
them
to
be
taken
at
their
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
whom
are
you
speaking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
mean
Lord
Warburton
and
his
friends
--
the
radicals
of
the
upper
*NL*
class
.
Of
course
I
only
know
the
way
it
strikes
me
.
They
talk
about
the
*NL*
changes
,
but
I
do
n't
think
they
quite
realise
.
You
and
I
,
you
know
,
we
*NL*
know
what
it
is
to
have
lived
under
democratic
institutions
:
I
always
*NL*
thought
them
very
comfortable
,
but
I
was
used
to
them
from
the
first
.
*NL*
And
then
I
ai
n't
a
lord
;
you
're
a
lady
,
my
dear
,
but
I
ai
n't
a
lord
.
Now
*NL*
over
here
I
do
n't
think
it
quite
comes
home
to
them
.
It
's
a
matter
of
*NL*
every
day
and
every
hour
,
and
I
do
n't
think
many
of
them
would
find
it
*NL*
as
pleasant
as
what
they
've
got
.
Of
course
if
they
want
to
try
,
it
's
*NL*
their
own
business
;
but
I
expect
they
wo
n't
try
very
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
they
're
sincere
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
want
to
FEEL
earnest
,
''
Mr.
Touchett
allowed
;
``
but
it
seems
*NL*
as
if
they
took
it
out
in
theories
mostly
.
Their
radical
views
are
a
*NL*
kind
of
amusement
;
they
've
got
to
have
some
amusement
,
and
they
might
*NL*
have
coarser
tastes
than
that
.
You
see
they
're
very
luxurious
,
and
these
*NL*
progressive
ideas
are
about
their
biggest
luxury
.
They
make
them
feel
*NL*
moral
and
yet
do
n't
damage
their
position
.
They
think
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
their
position
;
do
n't
let
one
of
them
ever
persuade
you
he
does
n't
,
for
*NL*
if
you
were
to
proceed
on
that
basis
you
'd
be
pulled
up
very
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
followed
her
uncle
's
argument
,
which
he
unfolded
with
his
quaint
*NL*
distinctness
,
most
attentively
,
and
though
she
was
unacquainted
with
the
*NL*
British
aristocracy
she
found
it
in
harmony
with
her
general
impressions
*NL*
of
human
nature
.
But
she
felt
moved
to
put
in
a
protest
on
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
's
behalf
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
Lord
Warburton
's
a
humbug
;
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
what
the
others
are
.
I
should
like
to
see
Lord
Warburton
put
to
the
*NL*
test
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
deliver
me
from
my
friends
!
''
Mr.
Touchett
answered
.
``
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
's
a
very
amiable
young
man
--
a
very
fine
young
man
.
He
has
a
*NL*
hundred
thousand
a
year
.
He
owns
fifty
thousand
acres
of
the
soil
of
*NL*
this
little
island
and
ever
so
many
other
things
besides
.
He
has
half
a
*NL*
dozen
houses
to
live
in
.
He
has
a
seat
in
Parliament
as
I
have
one
at
my
*NL*
own
dinner-table
.
He
has
elegant
tastes
--
cares
for
literature
,
for
art
,
*NL*
for
science
,
for
charming
young
ladies
.
The
most
elegant
is
his
taste
*NL*
for
the
new
views
.
It
affords
him
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
--
more
*NL*
perhaps
than
anything
else
,
except
the
young
ladies
.
His
old
house
over
*NL*
there
--
what
does
he
call
it
,
Lockleigh
?
--
is
very
attractive
;
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
it
's
as
pleasant
as
this
.
That
does
n't
matter
,
however
--
he
has
*NL*
so
many
others
.
His
views
do
n't
hurt
any
one
as
far
as
I
can
see
;
they
*NL*
certainly
do
n't
hurt
himself
.
And
if
there
were
to
be
a
revolution
he
*NL*
would
come
off
very
easily
.
They
would
n't
touch
him
,
they
'd
leave
him
as
*NL*
he
is
:
he
's
too
much
liked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
could
n't
be
a
martyr
even
if
he
wished
!
''
Isabel
sighed
.
``
That
's
*NL*
a
very
poor
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
never
be
a
martyr
unless
you
make
him
one
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
shook
her
head
;
there
might
have
been
something
laughable
in
the
*NL*
fact
that
she
did
it
with
a
touch
of
melancholy
.
``
I
shall
never
make
any
*NL*
one
a
martyr
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
never
be
one
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
.
But
you
do
n't
pity
Lord
Warburton
then
as
Ralph
does
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
uncle
looked
at
her
a
while
with
genial
acuteness

``
Yes

I
do

after

all
!

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
Misses
Molyneux
,
this
nobleman
's
sisters
,
came
presently
to
call
*NL*
upon
her
,
and
Isabel
took
a
fancy
to
the
young
ladies
,
who
appeared
to
*NL*
her
to
show
a
most
original
stamp
.
It
is
true
that
when
she
described
*NL*
them
to
her
cousin
by
that
term
he
declared
that
no
epithet
could
be
*NL*
less
applicable
than
this
to
the
two
Misses
Molyneux
,
since
there
*NL*
were
fifty
thousand
young
women
in
England
who
exactly
resembled
them
.
*NL*
Deprived
of
this
advantage
,
however
,
Isabel
's
visitors
retained
that
*NL*
of
an
extreme
sweetness
and
shyness
of
demeanour
,
and
of
having
,
as
*NL*
she
thought
,
eyes
like
the
balanced
basins
,
the
circles
of
``
ornamental
*NL*
water
,
''
set
,
in
parterres
,
among
the
geraniums
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
not
morbid
,
at
any
rate
,
whatever
they
are
,
''
our
heroine
said
*NL*
to
herself
;
and
she
deemed
this
a
great
charm
,
for
two
or
three
of
the
*NL*
friends
of
her
girlhood
had
been
regrettably
open
to
the
charge
-LRB-
they
*NL*
would
have
been
so
nice
without
it
-RRB-
,
to
say
nothing
of
Isabel
's
having
*NL*
occasionally
suspected
it
as
a
tendency
of
her
own
.
The
Misses
Molyneux
*NL*
were
not
in
their
first
youth
,
but
they
had
bright
,
fresh
complexions
*NL*
and
something
of
the
smile
of
childhood
.
Yes
,
their
eyes
,
which
Isabel
*NL*
admired
,
were
round
,
quiet
and
contented
,
and
their
figures
,
also
of
a
*NL*
generous
roundness
,
were
encased
in
sealskin
jackets
.
Their
friendliness
*NL*
was
great
,
so
great
that
they
were
almost
embarrassed
to
show
it
;
they
*NL*
seemed
somewhat
afraid
of
the
young
lady
from
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
world
and
rather
looked
than
spoke
their
good
wishes
.
But
they
made
it
*NL*
clear
to
her
that
they
hoped
she
would
come
to
luncheon
at
Lockleigh
,
*NL*
where
they
lived
with
their
brother
,
and
then
they
might
see
her
very
,
*NL*
very
often
.
They
wondered
if
she
would
n't
come
over
some
day
,
and
sleep
:
*NL*
they
were
expecting
some
people
on
the
twenty-ninth
,
so
perhaps
she
*NL*
would
come
while
the
people
were
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
it
is
n't
any
one
very
remarkable
,
''
said
the
elder
sister
;
*NL*
``
but
I
dare
say
you
'll
take
us
as
you
find
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
find
you
delightful
;
I
think
you
're
enchanting
just
as
you
*NL*
are
,
''
replied
Isabel
,
who
often
praised
profusely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
visitors
flushed
,
and
her
cousin
told
her
,
after
they
were
gone
,
*NL*
that
if
she
said
such
things
to
those
poor
girls
they
would
think
she
*NL*
was
in
some
wild
,
free
manner
practising
on
them
:
he
was
sure
it
was
the
*NL*
first
time
they
had
been
called
enchanting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
''
Isabel
answered
.
``
I
think
it
's
lovely
to
be
so
quiet
*NL*
and
reasonable
and
satisfied
.
I
should
like
to
be
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forbid
!
''
cried
Ralph
with
ardour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
try
and
imitate
them
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
I
want
very
much
to
see
*NL*
them
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
this
pleasure
a
few
days
later
,
when
,
with
Ralph
and
his
mother
,
*NL*
she
drove
over
to
Lockleigh
.
She
found
the
Misses
Molyneux
sitting
in
a
*NL*
vast
drawing-room
-LRB-
she
perceived
afterwards
it
was
one
of
several
-RRB-
in
a
*NL*
wilderness
of
faded
chintz
;
they
were
dressed
on
this
occasion
in
black
*NL*
velveteen
.
Isabel
liked
them
even
better
at
home
than
she
had
done
at
*NL*
Gardencourt
,
and
was
more
than
ever
struck
with
the
fact
that
they
were
*NL*
not
morbid
.
It
had
seemed
to
her
before
that
if
they
had
a
fault
it
was
*NL*
a
want
of
play
of
mind
;
but
she
presently
saw
they
were
capable
of
deep
*NL*
emotion
.
Before
luncheon
she
was
alone
with
them
for
some
time
,
on
one
*NL*
side
of
the
room
,
while
Lord
Warburton
,
at
a
distance
,
talked
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
true
your
brother
's
such
a
great
radical
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
She
*NL*
knew
it
was
true
,
but
we
have
seen
that
her
interest
in
human
nature
was
*NL*
keen
,
and
she
had
a
desire
to
draw
the
Misses
Molyneux
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
;
he
's
immensely
advanced
,
''
said
Mildred
,
the
younger
*NL*
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
same
time
Warburton
's
very
reasonable
,
''
Miss
Molyneux
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
watched
him
a
moment
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
;
he
was
*NL*
clearly
trying
hard
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
Mrs.
Touchett
.
Ralph
*NL*
had
met
the
frank
advances
of
one
of
the
dogs
before
the
fire
that
the
*NL*
temperature
of
an
English
August
,
in
the
ancient
expanses
,
had
not
*NL*
made
an
impertinence
.
``
Do
you
suppose
your
brother
's
sincere
?
''
Isabel
*NL*
enquired
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
must
be
,
you
know
!
''
Mildred
exclaimed
quickly
,
while
the
elder
*NL*
sister
gazed
at
our
heroine
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
would
stand
the
test
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
test
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
for
instance
having
to
give
up
all
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Having
to
give
up
Lockleigh
?
''
said
Miss
Molyneux
,
finding
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
the
other
places
;
what
are
they
called
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
sisters
exchanged
an
almost
frightened
glance
.
``
Do
you
mean
--
do
*NL*
you
mean
on
account
of
the
expense
?
''
the
younger
one
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
he
might
let
one
or
two
of
his
houses
,
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
for
nothing
?
''
Isabel
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
fancy
his
giving
up
his
property
,
''
said
Miss
Molyneux
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
'm
afraid
he
is
an
impostor
!
''
Isabel
returned
.
``
Do
n't
you
think
*NL*
it
's
a
false
position
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
companions
,
evidently
,
had
lost
themselves
.
``
My
brother
's
position
?
''
*NL*
Miss
Molyneux
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
thought
a
very
good
position
,
''
said
the
younger
sister
.
``
It
's
the
*NL*
first
position
in
this
part
of
the
county
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
you
think
me
very
irreverent
,
''
Isabel
took
occasion
to
*NL*
remark
.
``
I
suppose
you
revere
your
brother
and
are
rather
afraid
of
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
one
looks
up
to
one
's
brother
,
''
said
Miss
Molyneux
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
that
he
must
be
very
good
--
because
you
,
evidently
,
are
*NL*
beautifully
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
most
kind
.
It
will
never
be
known
,
the
good
he
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
ability
is
known
,
''
Mildred
added
;
``
every
one
thinks
it
's
immense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
can
see
that
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
But
if
I
were
he
I
should
wish
to
*NL*
fight
to
the
death
:
I
mean
for
the
heritage
of
the
past
.
I
should
hold
*NL*
it
tight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
one
ought
to
be
liberal
,
''
Mildred
argued
gently
.
``
We
've
always
*NL*
been
so
,
even
from
the
earliest
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
you
've
made
a
great
success
of
it
;
I
do
n't
*NL*
wonder
you
like
it
.
I
see
you
're
very
fond
of
crewels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Lord
Warburton
showed
her
the
house
,
after
luncheon
,
it
seemed
to
*NL*
her
a
matter
of
course
that
it
should
be
a
noble
picture
.
Within
,
it
*NL*
had
been
a
good
deal
modernised
--
some
of
its
best
points
had
lost
their
*NL*
purity
;
but
as
they
saw
it
from
the
gardens
,
a
stout
grey
pile
,
of
the
*NL*
softest
,
deepest
,
most
weather-fretted
hue
,
rising
from
a
broad
,
still
*NL*
moat
,
it
affected
the
young
visitor
as
a
castle
in
a
legend
.
The
day
was
*NL*
cool
and
rather
lustreless
;
the
first
note
of
autumn
had
been
struck
,
*NL*
and
the
watery
sunshine
rested
on
the
walls
in
blurred
and
desultory
*NL*
gleams
,
washing
them
,
as
it
were
,
in
places
tenderly
chosen
,
where
the
*NL*
ache
of
antiquity
was
keenest
.
Her
host
's
brother
,
the
Vicar
,
had
come
*NL*
to
luncheon
,
and
Isabel
had
had
five
minutes
'
talk
with
him
--
time
enough
*NL*
to
institute
a
search
for
a
rich
ecclesiasticism
and
give
it
up
as
*NL*
vain
.
The
marks
of
the
Vicar
of
Lockleigh
were
a
big
,
athletic
figure
,
*NL*
a
candid
,
natural
countenance
,
a
capacious
appetite
and
a
tendency
to
*NL*
indiscriminate
laughter
.
Isabel
learned
afterwards
from
her
cousin
*NL*
that
before
taking
orders
he
had
been
a
mighty
wrestler
and
that
he
*NL*
was
still
,
on
occasion
--
in
the
privacy
of
the
family
circle
as
it
*NL*
were
--
quite
capable
of
flooring
his
man
.
Isabel
liked
him
--
she
was
in
*NL*
the
mood
for
liking
everything
;
but
her
imagination
was
a
good
deal
*NL*
taxed
to
think
of
him
as
a
source
of
spiritual
aid
.
The
whole
party
,
on
*NL*
leaving
lunch
,
went
to
walk
in
the
grounds
;
but
Lord
Warburton
exercised
*NL*
some
ingenuity
in
engaging
his
least
familiar
guest
in
a
stroll
apart
*NL*
from
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
to
see
the
place
properly
,
seriously
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
ca
n't
*NL*
do
so
if
your
attention
is
distracted
by
irrelevant
gossip
.
''
His
own
*NL*
conversation
-LRB-
though
he
told
Isabel
a
good
deal
about
the
house
,
which
*NL*
had
a
very
curious
history
-RRB-
was
not
purely
archaeological
;
he
reverted
*NL*
at
intervals
to
matters
more
personal
--
matters
personal
to
the
young
*NL*
lady
as
well
as
to
himself
.
But
at
last
,
after
a
pause
of
some
duration
,
*NL*
returning
for
a
moment
to
their
ostensible
theme
,
``
Ah
,
well
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
glad
indeed
you
like
the
old
barrack
.
I
wish
you
could
see
*NL*
more
of
it
--
that
you
could
stay
here
a
while
.
My
sisters
have
taken
an
*NL*
immense
fancy
to
you
--
if
that
would
be
any
inducement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
want
of
inducements
,
''
Isabel
answered
;
``
but
I
'm
afraid
I
*NL*
ca
n't
make
engagements
.
I
'm
quite
in
my
aunt
's
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
pardon
me
if
I
say
I
do
n't
exactly
believe
that
.
I
'm
pretty
sure
*NL*
you
can
do
whatever
you
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
if
I
make
that
impression
on
you
;
I
do
n't
think
it
's
a
nice
*NL*
impression
to
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
the
merit
of
permitting
me
to
hope
.
''
And
Lord
Warburton
paused
a
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
in

I
may
see
you
often

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
to
enjoy
that
pleasure
I
need
n't
be
so
terribly
*NL*
emancipated

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
not

and
yet
,
at
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

very
much

very
highly

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
have
talked
about
me

said
Lord
Warburton
.
``
But

I
*NL*
nevertheless
do
n't
think
he
'd
like
me
to
keep
coming
to
Gardencourt

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
answer
for
my
uncle
's
tastes

''
the
girl
rejoined
,
``
though
I
*NL*
ought
as
far
as
possible
to
take
them
into
account

But
for
myself
I
*NL*
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
's
what
I
like
to

you

I
'm
charmed

you
say
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
easily
charmed

my
lord

said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I

not

charmed

And
then
he
stopped
a
moment
.
``
But
you
've
*NL*
charmed
me

Miss
Archer

*NL*
*NL*
These
words
were
uttered
with
an
indefinable
sound
which
startled
the
*NL*
girl
;
it
struck
her
as
the
prelude
to
something
grave
:
she
had
heard
the
*NL*
sound
before
and
she
recognised
it
.
She
had
no
wish
,
however
,
that
for
*NL*
the
moment
such
a
prelude
should
have
a
sequel
,
and
she
said
as
gaily
*NL*
as
possible
and
as
quickly
as
an
appreciable
degree
of
agitation
would
*NL*
allow
her
:
``
I
'm
afraid
there
's
no
prospect
of
my
being
able
to
come
here
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
?
''
said
Lord
Warburton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
say
`
never
'
;
I
should
feel
very
melodramatic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
come
and
see
you
then
some
day
next
week
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
assuredly
.
What
is
there
to
prevent
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
tangible
.
But
with
you
I
never
feel
safe

I
've
a
sort
of
sense
*NL*
that
you
're
always
summing
people
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do

lose
by
that

*NL*
*NL*

you
to

so

I
gain

stern

not
what
I
most

Is
Mrs.

*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*

Is
England
not
good
enough

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
very
Machiavellian
speech

it

many

*NL*
*NL*

Lord

good

Is
there
anything

executed
every
year
,
in
the
most
public
manner
,
by
fifty
thousand
of
*NL*
my
fellow-countrymen

the
purpose

improving
one

by
foreign
*NL*
travel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
improve
your
mind

Miss
Archer
,
''
her
companion
declared
.
*NL*
``
It
's
already
a
most
formidable
instrument

It
looks
down
on
us
all
;
it
*NL*
despises
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Despises
you
?
You
're
making
fun
of
me
,
''
said
Isabel
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
think
us
`
quaint
'
--
that
's
the
same
thing
.
I
wo
n't
be
thought
*NL*
`
quaint
,
'
to
begin
with
;
I
'm
not
so
in
the
least
.
I
protest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
protest
is
one
of
the
quaintest
things
I
've
ever
heard
,
''
Isabel
*NL*
answered
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
was
briefly
silent
.
``
You
judge
only
from
the
outside
--
you
*NL*
do
n't
care
,
''
he
said
presently
.
``
You
only
care
to
amuse
yourself
.
''
The
*NL*
note
she
had
heard
in
his
voice
a
moment
before
reappeared
,
and
mixed
*NL*
with
it
now
was
an
audible
strain
of
bitterness
--
a
bitterness
so
abrupt
*NL*
and
inconsequent
that
the
girl
was
afraid
she
had
hurt
him
.
She
had
*NL*
often
heard
that
the
English
are
a
highly
eccentric
people
,
and
she
*NL*
had
even
read
in
some
ingenious
author
that
they
are
at
bottom
the
most
*NL*
romantic
of
races
.
Was
Lord
Warburton
suddenly
turning
romantic
--
was
he
*NL*
going
to
make
her
a
scene
,
in
his
own
house
,
only
the
third
time
they
*NL*
had
met
?
She
was
reassured
quickly
enough
by
her
sense
of
his
great
good
*NL*
manners
,
which
was
not
impaired
by
the
fact
that
he
had
already
touched
*NL*
the
furthest
limit
of
good
taste
in
expressing
his
admiration
of
a
young
*NL*
lady
who
had
confided
in
his
hospitality
.
She
was
right
in
trusting
*NL*
to
his
good
manners
,
for
he
presently
went
on
,
laughing
a
little
and
*NL*
without
a
trace
of
the
accent
that
had
discomposed
her
:
``
I
do
n't
mean
of
*NL*
course
that
you
amuse
yourself
with
trifles
.
You
select
great
materials
;
*NL*
the
foibles
,
the
afflictions
of
human
nature
,
the
peculiarities
of
*NL*
nations
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
regards
that
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
I
should
find
in
my
own
nation
*NL*
entertainment
for
a
lifetime
.
But
we
've
a
long
drive
,
and
my
aunt
*NL*
will
soon
wish
to
start
.
''
She
turned
back
toward
the
others
and
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
walked
beside
her
in
silence
.
But
before
they
reached
the
*NL*
others
,
``
I
shall
come
and
see
you
next
week
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
received
an
appreciable
shock
,
but
as
it
died
away
she
felt
that
*NL*
she
could
n't
pretend
to
herself
that
it
was
altogether
a
painful
one
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
she
made
answer
to
his
declaration
,
coldly
enough
,
``
Just
as
*NL*
you
please
.
''
And
her
coldness
was
not
the
calculation
of
her
effect
--
a
*NL*
game
she
played
in
a
much
smaller
degree
than
would
have
seemed
probable
*NL*
to
many
critics
.
It
came
from
a
certain
fear
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
her
visit
to
Lockleigh
she
received
a
note
from
her
friend
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
--
a
note
of
which
the
envelope
,
exhibiting
in
conjunction
*NL*
the
postmark
of
Liverpool
and
the
neat
calligraphy
of
the
quick-fingered
*NL*
Henrietta
,
caused
her
some
liveliness
of
emotion
.
``
Here
I
am
,
my
lovely
*NL*
friend
,
''
Miss
Stackpole
wrote
;
``
I
managed
to
get
off
at
last
.
I
decided
*NL*
only
the
night
before
I
left
New
York
--
the
Interviewer
having
come
round
*NL*
to
my
figure
.
I
put
a
few
things
into
a
bag
,
like
a
veteran
journalist
,
*NL*
and
came
down
to
the
steamer
in
a
street-car
.
Where
are
you
and
where
*NL*
can
we
meet
?
I
suppose
you
're
visiting
at
some
castle
or
other
and
have
*NL*
already
acquired
the
correct
accent
.
Perhaps
even
you
have
married
a
*NL*
lord
;
I
almost
hope
you
have
,
for
I
want
some
introductions
to
the
first
*NL*
people
and
shall
count
on
you
for
a
few
.
The
Interviewer
wants
some
*NL*
light
on
the
nobility
.
My
first
impressions
-LRB-
of
the
people
at
large
-RRB-
are
*NL*
not
rose-coloured
;
but
I
wish
to
talk
them
over
with
you
,
and
you
know
*NL*
that
,
whatever
I
am
,
at
least
I
'm
not
superficial
.
I
've
also
something
*NL*
very
particular
to
tell
you
.
Do
appoint
a
meeting
as
quickly
as
you
can
;
*NL*
come
to
London
-LRB-
I
should
like
so
much
to
visit
the
sights
with
you
-RRB-
or
*NL*
else
let
me
come
to
you
,
wherever
you
are
.
I
will
do
so
with
pleasure
;
*NL*
for
you
know
everything
interests
me
and
I
wish
to
see
as
much
as
*NL*
possible
of
the
inner
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
judged
best
not
to
show
this
letter
to
her
uncle
;
but
she
*NL*
acquainted
him
with
its
purport
,
and
,
as
she
expected
,
he
begged
her
*NL*
instantly
to
assure
Miss
Stackpole
,
in
his
name
,
that
he
should
be
*NL*
delighted
to
receive
her
at
Gardencourt
.
``
Though
she
's
a
literary
lady
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
I
suppose
that
,
being
an
American
,
she
wo
n't
show
me
up
,
as
*NL*
that
other
one
did
.
She
has
seen
others
like
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
seen
no
other
so
delightful
!
''
Isabel
answered
;
but
she
was
*NL*
not
altogether
at
ease
about
Henrietta
's
reproductive
instincts
,
which
*NL*
belonged
to
that
side
of
her
friend
's
character
which
she
regarded
with
*NL*
least
complacency
.
She
wrote
to
Miss
Stackpole
,
however
,
that
she
would
*NL*
be
very
welcome
under
Mr.
Touchett
's
roof
;
and
this
alert
young
woman
*NL*
lost
no
time
in
announcing
her
prompt
approach
.
She
had
gone
up
to
*NL*
London
,
and
it
was
from
that
centre
that
she
took
the
train
for
the
*NL*
station
nearest
to
Gardencourt
,
where
Isabel
and
Ralph
were
in
waiting
*NL*
to
receive
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
love
her
or
shall
I
hate
her
?
''
Ralph
asked
while
they
moved
*NL*
along
the
platform
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whichever
you
do
will
matter
very
little
to
her
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
She
*NL*
does
n't
care
a
straw
what
men
think
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
man
I
'm
bound
to
dislike
her
then
.
She
must
be
a
kind
of
monster
.
*NL*
Is
she
very
ugly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
's
decidedly
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
female
interviewer
--
a
reporter
in
petticoats
?
I
'm
very
curious
to
see
*NL*
her
,
''
Ralph
conceded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
easy
to
laugh
at
her
but
it
is
not
easy
to
be
as
brave
as
*NL*
she
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
not
;
crimes
of
violence
and
attacks
on
the
person
*NL*
require
more
or
less
pluck
.
Do
you
suppose
she
'll
interview
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
in
the
world
.
She
'll
not
think
you
of
enough
importance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
see
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
She
'll
send
a
description
of
us
all
,
*NL*
including
Bunchie
,
to
her
newspaper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
ask
her
not
to
,
''
Isabel
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
she
's
capable
of
it
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
you
've
made
her
your
bosom-friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
made
her
my
bosom-friend
;
but
I
like
her
in
spite
of
her
*NL*
faults
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
I
'm
afraid
I
shall
dislike
her
in
spite
of
her
*NL*
merits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
probably
fall
in
love
with
her
at
the
end
of
three
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
my
love-letters
published
in
the
Interviewer
?
Never
!
''
cried
*NL*
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
presently
arrived
,
and
Miss
Stackpole
,
promptly
descending
,
*NL*
proved
,
as
Isabel
had
promised
,
quite
delicately
,
even
though
rather
*NL*
provincially
,
fair
.
She
was
a
neat
,
plump
person
,
of
medium
stature
,
*NL*
with
a
round
face
,
a
small
mouth
,
a
delicate
complexion
,
a
bunch
of
*NL*
light
brown
ringlets
at
the
back
of
her
head
and
a
peculiarly
open
,
*NL*
surprised-looking
eye
.
The
most
striking
point
in
her
appearance
was
the
*NL*
remarkable
fixedness
of
this
organ
,
which
rested
without
impudence
or
*NL*
defiance
,
but
as
if
in
conscientious
exercise
of
a
natural
right
,
upon
*NL*
every
object
it
happened
to
encounter
.
It
rested
in
this
manner
upon
*NL*
Ralph
himself
,
a
little
arrested
by
Miss
Stackpole
's
gracious
and
*NL*
comfortable
aspect
,
which
hinted
that
it
would
n't
be
so
easy
as
he
had
*NL*
assumed
to
disapprove
of
her
.
She
rustled
,
she
shimmered
,
in
fresh
,
*NL*
dove-coloured
draperies
,
and
Ralph
saw
at
a
glance
that
she
was
as
crisp
*NL*
and
new
and
comprehensive
as
a
first
issue
before
the
folding
.
From
top
*NL*
to
toe
she
had
probably
no
misprint
.
She
spoke
in
a
clear
,
high
voice
--
a
*NL*
voice
not
rich
but
loud
;
yet
after
she
had
taken
her
place
with
her
*NL*
companions
in
Mr.
Touchett
's
carriage
she
struck
him
as
not
all
in
the
*NL*
large
type
,
the
type
of
horrid
``
headings
,
''
that
he
had
expected
.
She
*NL*
answered
the
enquiries
made
of
her
by
Isabel
,
however
,
and
in
which
the
*NL*
young
man
ventured
to
join
,
with
copious
lucidity
;
and
later
,
in
the
*NL*
library
at
Gardencourt
,
when
she
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
Mr.
*NL*
Touchett
-LRB-
his
wife
not
having
thought
it
necessary
to
appear
-RRB-
did
more
*NL*
to
give
the
measure
of
her
confidence
in
her
powers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
should
like
to
know
whether
you
consider
yourselves
American
*NL*
or
English
,
''
she
broke
out
.
``
If
once
I
knew
I
could
talk
to
you
*NL*
accordingly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talk
to
us
anyhow
and
we
shall
be
thankful
,
''
Ralph
liberally
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
,
and
there
was
something
in
their
character
*NL*
that
reminded
him
of
large
polished
buttons
--
buttons
that
might
have
*NL*
fixed
the
elastic
loops
of
some
tense
receptacle
:
he
seemed
to
see
the
*NL*
reflection
of
surrounding
objects
on
the
pupil
.
The
expression
of
a
*NL*
button
is
not
usually
deemed
human
,
but
there
was
something
in
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
's
gaze
that
made
him
,
as
a
very
modest
man
,
feel
vaguely
*NL*
embarrassed
--
less
inviolate
,
more
dishonoured
,
than
he
liked
.
This
*NL*
sensation
,
it
must
be
added
,
after
he
had
spent
a
day
or
two
in
her
*NL*
company
,
sensibly
diminished
,
though
it
never
wholly
lapsed
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
suppose
that
you
're
going
to
undertake
to
persuade
me
that
you
're
an
*NL*
American
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
please
you
I
'll
be
an
Englishman
,
I
'll
be
a
Turk
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
can
change
about
that
way
you
're
very
welcome
,
''
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
understand
everything
and
that
differences
of
nationality
*NL*
are
no
barrier
to
you
,
''
Ralph
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
gazed
at
him
still
.
``
Do
you
mean
the
foreign
languages
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
languages
are
nothing
.
I
mean
the
spirit
--
the
genius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
that
I
understand
you
,
''
said
the
correspondent
of
the
*NL*
Interviewer
;
``
but
I
expect
I
shall
before
I
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
what
's
called
a
cosmopolite
,
''
Isabel
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
means
he
's
a
little
of
everything
and
not
much
of
any
.
I
must
say
*NL*
I
think
patriotism
is
like
charity
--
it
begins
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
where
does
home
begin
,
Miss
Stackpole
?
''
Ralph
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
where
it
begins
,
but
I
know
where
it
ends
.
It
ended
a
long
*NL*
time
before
I
got
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
like
it
over
here
?
''
asked
Mr.
Touchett
with
his
aged
,
*NL*
innocent
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
I
have
n't
quite
made
up
my
mind
what
ground
I
shall
take
.
*NL*
I
feel
a
good
deal
cramped
.
I
felt
it
on
the
journey
from
Liverpool
to
*NL*
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
were
in
a
crowded
carriage
,
''
Ralph
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
it
was
crowded
with
friends
--
party
of
Americans
whose
*NL*
acquaintance
I
had
made
upon
the
steamer
;
a
lovely
group
from
Little
*NL*
Rock
,
Arkansas
.
In
spite
of
that
I
felt
cramped
--
I
felt
something
*NL*
pressing
upon
me
;
I
could
n't
tell
what
it
was
.
I
felt
at
the
very
*NL*
commencement
as
if
I
were
not
going
to
accord
with
the
atmosphere
.
But
*NL*
I
suppose
I
shall
make
my
own
atmosphere
.
That
's
the
true
way
--
then
you
*NL*
can
breathe
.
Your
surroundings
seem
very
attractive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
we
too
are
a
lovely
group
!
''
said
Ralph
.
``
Wait
a
little
and
you
'll
*NL*
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
showed
every
disposition
to
wait
and
evidently
was
*NL*
prepared
to
make
a
considerable
stay
at
Gardencourt
.
She
occupied
*NL*
herself
in
the
mornings
with
literary
labour
;
but
in
spite
of
this
*NL*
Isabel
spent
many
hours
with
her
friend
,
who
,
once
her
daily
task
*NL*
performed
,
deprecated
,
in
fact
defied
,
isolation
.
Isabel
speedily
found
*NL*
occasion
to
desire
her
to
desist
from
celebrating
the
charms
of
their
*NL*
common
sojourn
in
print
,
having
discovered
,
on
the
second
morning
*NL*
of
Miss
Stackpole
's
visit
,
that
she
was
engaged
on
a
letter
to
the
*NL*
Interviewer
,
of
which
the
title
,
in
her
exquisitely
neat
and
legible
*NL*
hand
-LRB-
exactly
that
of
the
copybooks
which
our
heroine
remembered
at
*NL*
school
-RRB-
was
``
Americans
and
Tudors
--
Glimpses
of
Gardencourt
.
''
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
,
with
the
best
conscience
in
the
world
,
offered
to
read
her
*NL*
letter
to
Isabel
,
who
immediately
put
in
her
protest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
you
ought
to
do
that
.
I
do
n't
think
you
ought
to
describe
*NL*
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
gazed
at
her
as
usual
.
``
Why
,
it
's
just
what
the
people
want
,
*NL*
and
it
's
a
lovely
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
lovely
to
be
put
in
the
newspapers
,
and
it
's
not
what
my
uncle
*NL*
wants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
believe
that
!
''
cried
Henrietta
.
``
They
're
always
delighted
*NL*
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
uncle
wo
n't
be
delighted
--
nor
my
cousin
either
.
They
'll
consider
it
*NL*
a
breach
of
hospitality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
showed
no
sense
of
confusion
;
she
simply
wiped
her
pen
,
*NL*
very
neatly
,
upon
an
elegant
little
implement
which
she
kept
for
the
*NL*
purpose
,
and
put
away
her
manuscript
.
``
Of
course
if
you
do
n't
approve
I
*NL*
wo
n't
do
it
;
but
I
sacrifice
a
beautiful
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
plenty
of
other
subjects
,
there
are
subjects
all
round
you

*NL*
We
'll
take
some
drives
;
I
'll
show
you
some
charming
scenery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scenery
's
not
my
department
;
I
always
need
a
human
interest
.
You
know
*NL*
I
'm
deeply
human
,
Isabel
;
I
always
was
,
''
Miss
Stackpole
rejoined
.
``
I
was
*NL*
going
to
bring
in
your
cousin
--
the
alienated
American
.
There
's
a
*NL*
great
demand
just
now
for
the
alienated
American
,
and
your
cousin
's
a
*NL*
beautiful
specimen
.
I
should
have
handled
him
severely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
have
died
of
it
!
''
Isabel
exclaimed
.
``
Not
of
the
severity
,
but
*NL*
of
the
publicity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
should
have
liked
to
kill
him
a
little
.
And
I
should
have
*NL*
delighted
to
do
your
uncle
,
who
seems
to
me
a
much
nobler
type
--
the
*NL*
American
faithful
still
.
He
's
a
grand
old
man
;
I
do
n't
see
how
he
can
*NL*
object
to
my
paying
him
honour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
looked
at
her
companion
in
much
wonderment
;
it
struck
her
as
*NL*
strange
that
a
nature
in
which
she
found
so
much
to
esteem
should
break
*NL*
down
so
in
spots
.
``
My
poor
Henrietta
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
've
no
sense
of
*NL*
privacy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
coloured
deeply
,
and
for
a
moment
her
brilliant
eyes
were
*NL*
suffused
,
while
Isabel
found
her
more
than
ever
inconsequent
.
``
You
do
me
*NL*
great
injustice
,
''
said
Miss
Stackpole
with
dignity
.
``
I
've
never
written
*NL*
a
word
about
myself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
sure
of
that
;
but
it
seems
to
me
one
should
be
modest
for
*NL*
others
also
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
very
good
!
''
cried
Henrietta
,
seizing
her
pen
again
.
``
Just
*NL*
let
me
make
a
note
of
it
and
I
'll
put
it
in
somewhere
.
''
she
was
a
*NL*
thoroughly
good-natured
woman
,
and
half
an
hour
later
she
was
in
as
*NL*
cheerful
a
mood
as
should
have
been
looked
for
in
a
newspaper-lady
*NL*
in
want
of
matter
.
``
I
've
promised
to
do
the
social
side
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
Isabel
;
``
and
how
can
I
do
it
unless
I
get
ideas
?
If
I
ca
n't
describe
*NL*
this
place
do
n't
you
know
some
place
I
can
describe
?
''
Isabel
promised
*NL*
she
would
bethink
herself
,
and
the
next
day
,
in
conversation
with
her
*NL*
friend
,
she
happened
to
mention
her
visit
to
Lord
Warburton
's
ancient
*NL*
house
.
``
Ah
,
you
must
take
me
there
--
that
's
just
the
place
for
me
!
''
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
cried
.
``
I
must
get
a
glimpse
of
the
nobility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
take
you
,
''
said
Isabel
;
``
but
Lord
Warburton
's
coming
here
,
and
*NL*
you
'll
have
a
chance
to
see
him
and
observe
him
.
Only
if
you
intend
to
*NL*
repeat
his
conversation
I
shall
certainly
give
him
warning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
do
that
,
''
her
companion
pleaded
;
``
I
want
him
to
be
natural
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
Englishman
's
never
so
natural
as
when
he
's
holding
his
tongue
,
''
*NL*
Isabel
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
apparent
,
at
the
end
of
three
days
,
that
her
cousin
had
,
*NL*
according
to
her
prophecy
,
lost
his
heart
to
their
visitor
,
though
he
*NL*
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
in
her
society
.
They
strolled
about
the
*NL*
park
together
and
sat
under
the
trees
,
and
in
the
afternoon
,
when
it
was
*NL*
delightful
to
float
along
the
Thames
,
Miss
Stackpole
occupied
a
place
*NL*
in
the
boat
in
which
hitherto
Ralph
had
had
but
a
single
companion
.
Her
*NL*
presence
proved
somehow
less
irreducible
to
soft
particles
than
Ralph
*NL*
had
expected
in
the
natural
perturbation
of
his
sense
of
the
perfect
*NL*
solubility
of
that
of
his
cousin
;
for
the
correspondent
of
the
*NL*
Interviewer
prompted
mirth
in
him
,
and
he
had
long
since
decided
that
*NL*
the
crescendo
of
mirth
should
be
the
flower
of
his
declining
days
.
*NL*
Henrietta
,
on
her
side
,
failed
a
little
to
justify
Isabel
's
declaration
*NL*
with
regard
to
her
indifference
to
masculine
opinion
;
for
poor
Ralph
*NL*
appeared
to
have
presented
himself
to
her
as
an
irritating
problem
,
*NL*
which
it
would
be
almost
immoral
not
to
work
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
he
do
for
a
living
?
''
she
asked
of
Isabel
the
evening
of
her
*NL*
arrival
.
``
Does
he
go
round
all
day
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
nothing
,
''
smiled
Isabel
;
``
he
's
a
gentleman
of
large
leisure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
call
that
a
shame
--
when
I
have
to
work
like
a
car-conductor
,
''
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
replied
.
``
I
should
like
to
show
him
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
in
wretched
health
;
he
's
quite
unfit
for
work
,
''
Isabel
urged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pshaw
!
do
n't
you
believe
it
.
I
work
when
I
'm
sick
,
''
cried
her
friend
.
*NL*
Later
,
when
she
stepped
into
the
boat
on
joining
the
water-party
,
she
*NL*
remarked
to
Ralph
that
she
supposed
he
hated
her
and
would
like
to
drown
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
no
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
I
keep
my
victims
for
a
slower
torture
.
And
you
'd
*NL*
be
such
an
interesting
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
do
torture
me
;
I
may
say
that
.
But
I
shock
all
your
*NL*
prejudices
;
that
's
one
comfort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
prejudices
?
I
have
n't
a
prejudice
to
bless
myself
with
.
There
's
*NL*
intellectual
poverty
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
more
shame
to
you
;
I
've
some
delicious
ones
.
Of
course
I
spoil
your
*NL*
flirtation
,
or
whatever
it
is
you
call
it
,
with
your
cousin
;
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
for
that
,
as
I
render
her
the
service
of
drawing
you
out
.
She
'll
*NL*
see
how
thin
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
do
draw
me
out
!
''
Ralph
exclaimed
.
``
So
few
people
will
take
the
*NL*
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
,
in
this
undertaking
,
appeared
to
shrink
from
no
effort
;
*NL*
resorting
largely
,
whenever
the
opportunity
offered
,
to
the
natural
*NL*
expedient
of
interrogation
.
On
the
following
day
the
weather
was
*NL*
bad
,
and
in
the
afternoon
the
young
man
,
by
way
of
providing
indoor
*NL*
amusement
,
offered
to
show
her
the
pictures
.
Henrietta
strolled
through
*NL*
the
long
gallery
in
his
society
,
while
he
pointed
out
its
principal
*NL*
ornaments
and
mentioned
the
painters
and
subjects
.
Miss
Stackpole
looked
*NL*
at
the
pictures
in
perfect
silence
,
committing
herself
to
no
opinion
,
*NL*
and
Ralph
was
gratified
by
the
fact
that
she
delivered
herself
of
none
*NL*
of
the
little
ready-made
ejaculations
of
delight
of
which
the
visitors
*NL*
to
Gardencourt
were
so
frequently
lavish
.
This
young
lady
indeed
,
to
do
*NL*
her
justice
,
was
but
little
addicted
to
the
use
of
conventional
terms
;
*NL*
there
was
something
earnest
and
inventive
in
her
tone
,
which
at
times
,
*NL*
in
its
strained
deliberation
,
suggested
a
person
of
high
culture
*NL*
speaking
a
foreign
language
.
Ralph
Touchett
subsequently
learned
that
*NL*
she
had
at
one
time
officiated
as
art
critic
to
a
journal
of
the
other
*NL*
world
;
but
she
appeared
,
in
spite
of
this
fact
,
to
carry
in
her
pocket
*NL*
none
of
the
small
change
of
admiration
.
Suddenly
,
just
after
he
had
*NL*
called
her
attention
to
a
charming
Constable
,
she
turned
and
looked
at
*NL*
him
as
if
he
himself
had
been
a
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
always
spend
your
time
like
this
?
''
she
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
seldom
spend
it
so
agreeably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
what
I
mean
--
without
any
regular
occupation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
I
'm
the
idlest
man
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
directed
her
gaze
to
the
Constable
again
,
and
Ralph
*NL*
bespoke
her
attention
for
a
small
Lancret
hanging
near
it
,
which
*NL*
represented
a
gentleman
in
a
pink
doublet
and
hose
and
a
ruff
,
leaning
*NL*
against
the
pedestal
of
the
statue
of
a
nymph
in
a
garden
and
playing
*NL*
the
guitar
to
two
ladies
seated
on
the
grass
.
``
That
's
my
ideal
of
a
*NL*
regular
occupation
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
turned
to
him
again
,
and
,
though
her
eyes
had
rested
*NL*
upon
the
picture
,
he
saw
she
had
missed
the
subject
.
She
was
thinking
*NL*
of
something
much
more
serious
.
``
I
do
n't
see
how
you
can
reconcile
it
to
*NL*
your
conscience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
lady
,
I
have
no
conscience
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
advise
you
to
cultivate
one
.
You
'll
need
it
the
next
time
you
*NL*
go
to
America
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
probably
never
go
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ashamed
to
show
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
meditated
with
a
mild
smile
.
``
I
suppose
that
if
one
has
no
*NL*
conscience
one
has
no
shame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
've
got
plenty
of
assurance
,
''
Henrietta
declared
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
consider
it
right
to
give
up
your
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
one
does
n't
give
up
one
's
country
any
more
than
one
gives
UP
*NL*
one
's
grandmother
.
They
're
both
antecedent
to
choice
--
elements
of
one
's
*NL*
composition
that
are
not
to
be
eliminated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
means
that
you
've
tried
and
been
worsted
.
What
do
they
*NL*
think
of
you
over
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
delight
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
because
you
truckle
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
set
it
down
a
little
to
my
natural
charm
!
''
Ralph
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
your
natural
charm
.
If
you
've
got
any
charm
*NL*
it
's
quite
unnatural
.
It
's
wholly
acquired
--
or
at
least
you
've
tried
*NL*
hard
to
acquire
it
,
living
over
here
.
I
do
n't
say
you
've
succeeded
.
It
's
*NL*
a
charm
that
I
do
n't
appreciate
,
anyway
.
Make
yourself
useful
in
some
*NL*
way
,
and
then
we
'll
talk
about
it
.
''
``
Well
,
now
,
tell
me
what
I
shall
*NL*
do
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
right
home
,
to
begin
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
see

And
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
right
hold
of
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
what
sort
of
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
you
please
,
so
long
as
you
take
hold
.
Some
new
idea
,
some
big
*NL*
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
very
difficult
to
take
hold
?
''
Ralph
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
you
put
your
heart
into
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
heart
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
If
it
depends
upon
my
heart
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
got
a
heart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
one
a
few
days
ago
,
but
I
've
lost
it
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
serious
,
''
Miss
Stackpole
remarked
;
``
that
's
what
's
the
matter
*NL*
with
you
.
''
But
for
all
this
,
in
a
day
or
two
,
she
again
permitted
him
to
*NL*
fix
her
attention
and
on
the
later
occasion
assigned
a
different
cause
*NL*
to
her
mysterious
perversity
.
``
I
know
what
's
the
matter
with
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
Touchett
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
think
you
're
too
good
to
get
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
till
I
knew
you
,
Miss
Stackpole
,
''
Ralph
answered
;
``
and
*NL*
then
I
suddenly
changed
my
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
pshaw
!
''
Henrietta
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
seemed
to
me
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
that
I
was
not
good
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
improve
you
.
Besides
,
it
's
your
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
cried
the
young
man
,
``
one
has
so
many
duties
!
Is
that
a
duty
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
--
did
you
never
know
that
before
?
It
's
every
one
's
duty
*NL*
to
get
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
meditated
a
moment
;
he
was
disappointed
.
There
was
something
in
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
he
had
begun
to
like
;
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
she
*NL*
was
not
a
charming
woman
she
was
at
least
a
very
good
``
sort
.
''
She
was
*NL*
wanting
in
distinction
,
but
,
as
Isabel
had
said
,
she
was
brave
:
she
went
*NL*
into
cages
,
she
flourished
lashes
,
like
a
spangled
lion-tamer
.
He
had
*NL*
not
supposed
her
to
be
capable
of
vulgar
arts
,
but
these
last
words
*NL*
struck
him
as
a
false
note
.
When
a
marriageable
young
woman
urges
*NL*
matrimony
on
an
unencumbered
young
man
the
most
obvious
explanation
of
*NL*
her
conduct
is
not
the
altruistic
impulse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
now
,
there
's
a
good
deal
to
be
said
about
that
,
''
Ralph
*NL*
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
may
be
,
but
that
's
the
principal
thing
.
I
must
say
I
think
it
*NL*
looks
very
exclusive
,
going
round
all
alone
,
as
if
you
thought
no
woman
*NL*
was
good
enough
for
you
.
Do
you
think
you
're
better
than
any
one
else
in
*NL*
the
world
?
In
America
it
's
usual
for
people
to
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
's
my
duty
,
''
Ralph
asked
,
``
is
it
not
,
by
analogy
,
yours
as
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
's
ocular
surfaces
unwinkingly
caught
the
sun
.
``
Have
you
*NL*
the
fond
hope
of
finding
a
flaw
in
my
reasoning
?
Of
course
I
've
as
good
*NL*
a
right
to
marry
as
any
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
I
wo
n't
say
it
vexes
me
to
see
you
single
.
It
*NL*
delights
me
rather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
serious
yet
.
You
never
will
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
not
believe
me
to
be
so
on
the
day
I
tell
you
I
desire
to
*NL*
give
up
the
practice
of
going
round
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
*NL*
announce
a
reply
that
might
technically
be
called
encouraging
.
But
to
*NL*
his
great
surprise
this
expression
suddenly
resolved
itself
into
an
*NL*
appearance
of
alarm
and
even
of
resentment
.
``
No
,
not
even
then
,
''
she
*NL*
answered
dryly
.
After
which
she
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
conceived
a
passion
for
your
friend
,
''
Ralph
said
that
evening
*NL*
to
Isabel
,
``
though
we
talked
some
time
this
morning
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
said
something
she
did
n't
like
,
''
the
girl
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
stared
.
``
Has
she
complained
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
told
me
she
thinks
there
's
something
very
low
in
the
tone
of
*NL*
Europeans
towards
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
she
call
me
a
European
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
the
worst
.
She
told
me
you
had
said
to
her
something
that
an
*NL*
American
never
would
have
said
.
But
she
did
n't
repeat
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
treated
himself
to
a
luxury
of
laughter
.
``
She
's
an
extraordinary
*NL*
combination
.
Did
she
think
I
was
making
love
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
believe
even
Americans
do
that
.
But
she
apparently
thought
you
*NL*
mistook
the
intention
of
something
she
had
said
,
and
put
an
unkind
*NL*
construction
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
she
was
proposing
marriage
to
me
and
I
accepted
her
.
Was
that
*NL*
unkind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
smiled
.
``
It
was
unkind
to
me
.
I
do
n't
want
you
to
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
cousin
,
what
's
one
to
do
among
you
all
?
''
Ralph
demanded
.
``
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
tells
me
it
's
my
bounden
duty
,
and
that
it
's
hers
,
in
general
,
*NL*
to
see
I
do
mine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
a
great
sense
of
duty
,
''
said
Isabel
gravely
.
``
She
has
indeed
,
*NL*
and
it
's
the
motive
of
everything
she
says

That
's
what
I
like
her
for
.
*NL*
She
thinks
it
's
unworthy
of
you
to
keep
so
many
things
to
yourself
.
*NL*
That
's
what
she
wanted
to
express
.
If
you
thought
she
was
trying
to
--
to
*NL*
attract
you
,
you
were
very
wrong

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
it
was
an
odd
way

I
did

attract

Forgive
my
depravity

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
conceited

no
interested

never
supposed

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
must
be
very
modest
then
to
talk
with
such
women

''
Ralph
said
*NL*
humbly
.
``
But
it
's
a
very
strange
type

She
's
too
personal
--
considering
*NL*
that
she
expects
other
people
not
to
be
.
She
walks
in
without
knocking
*NL*
at
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Isabel
admitted
,
``
she
does
n't
sufficiently
recognise
the
*NL*
existence
of
knockers
;
and
indeed
I
'm
not
sure
that
she
does
n't
think
*NL*
them
rather
a
pretentious
ornament

She
thinks
one
's
door
should
stand
*NL*
ajar

But
I
persist
in
liking
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
persist
in
thinking
her
too
familiar

Ralph
rejoined
,
naturally
*NL*
somewhat
uncomfortable
under
the
sense
of
having
been
doubly
deceived
in
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Isabel
,
smiling
,
``
I
'm
afraid
it
's
because
she
's
rather
*NL*
vulgar
that
I
like
her

``
She
would
be
flattered
by
your
reason

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
should
tell
her
I

express
it

way

I
should
say

it

because
there

something
of
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you

she

``
She
knows

enough

kind
*NL*
of
emanation
of
the
great
democracy
--
of
the
continent
,
the
country
,
the
*NL*
nation
.
I
do
n't
say
that
she
sums
it
all
up
,
that
would
be
too
much
to
*NL*
ask
of
her

But
she
suggests
it
;
she
vividly
figures
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
her
then
for
patriotic
reasons

I
'm
afraid

is
on
those
very
*NL*
grounds
I

to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Isabel
with
a
kind
of
joyous
sigh
,
``
I
like
so
many
things

If
*NL*
a
thing
strikes
me
with
a
certain
intensity
I
accept
it

I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
swagger
,
but
I
suppose
I
'm
rather
versatile

I
like
people
to
be
totally
*NL*
different
from
Henrietta
--
in
the
style
of
Lord
Warburton
's
sisters
for
*NL*
instance
.
So
long
as
I
look
at
the
Misses
Molyneux
they
seem
to
me
*NL*
to
answer
a
kind
of
ideal
.
Then
Henrietta
presents
herself
,
and
I
'm
*NL*
straightway
convinced
by
her
;
not
so
much
in
respect
to
herself
as
in
*NL*
respect
to
what
masses
behind
her
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
mean
the
back
view
of
her

Ralph
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
she
says
is
true

his
cousin
answered
;
``
you
'll
never
be
serious

I
like
the
great
country
stretching
away
beyond
the
rivers
and
across
*NL*
the
prairies
,
blooming
and
smiling
and
spreading
till
it
stops
at
the
*NL*
green
Pacific
!
A
strong
,
sweet
,
fresh
odour
seems
to
rise
from
it
,
*NL*
and
Henrietta
--
pardon
my
simile
--
has
something
of
that
odour
in
her
*NL*
garments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
blushed
a
little
as
she
concluded
this
speech
,
and
the
blush
,
*NL*
together
with
the
momentary
ardour
she
had
thrown
into
it
,
was
so
*NL*
becoming
to
her
that
Ralph
stood
smiling
at
her
for
a
moment
after
she
*NL*
had
ceased
speaking
.
``
I
'm
not
sure
the
Pacific
's
so
green
as
that

he
*NL*
said
;
``
but
you
're
a
young
woman
of
imagination

Henrietta
,
however

smell
of

it
almost
knocks

down

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
resolve
after
this
not
to
misinterpret
her
words
even
when
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
appeared
to
strike
the
personal
note
most
strongly
.
He
*NL*
bethought
himself
that
persons
,
in
her
view
,
were
simple
and
homogeneous
*NL*
organisms
,
and
that
he
,
for
his
own
part
,
was
too
perverted
a
*NL*
representative
of
the
nature
of
man
to
have
a
right
to
deal
with
her
*NL*
in
strict
reciprocity
.
He
carried
out
his
resolve
with
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
tact
,
and
the
young
lady
found
in
renewed
contact
with
him
no
obstacle
*NL*
to
the
exercise
of
her
genius
for
unshrinking
enquiry
,
the
general
*NL*
application
of
her
confidence
.
Her
situation
at
Gardencourt
therefore
,
*NL*
appreciated
as
we
have
seen
her
to
be
by
Isabel
and
full
of
appreciation
*NL*
herself
of
that
free
play
of
intelligence
which
,
to
her
sense
,
rendered
*NL*
Isabel
's
character
a
sister-spirit
,
and
of
the
easy
venerableness
of
Mr.
*NL*
Touchett
,
whose
noble
tone
,
as
she
said
,
met
with
her
full
approval
--
her
*NL*
situation
at
Gardencourt
would
have
been
perfectly
comfortable
had
she
*NL*
not
conceived
an
irresistible
mistrust
of
the
little
lady
for
whom
she
*NL*
had
at
first
supposed
herself
obliged
to
``
allow
''
as
mistress
of
the
*NL*
house
.
She
presently
discovered
,
in
truth
,
that
this
obligation
was
of
*NL*
the
lightest
and
that
Mrs.
Touchett
cared
very
little
how
Miss
Stackpole
*NL*
behaved
.
Mrs.
Touchett
had
defined
her
to
Isabel
as
both
an
adventuress
*NL*
and
a
bore
--
adventuresses
usually
giving
one
more
of
a
thrill
;
she
had
*NL*
expressed
some
surprise
at
her
niece
's
having
selected
such
a
friend
,
*NL*
yet
had
immediately
added
that
she
knew
Isabel
's
friends
were
her
own
*NL*
affair
and
that
she
had
never
undertaken
to
like
them
all
or
to
restrict
*NL*
the
girl
to
those
she
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
could
see
none
but
the
people
I
like
,
my
dear
,
you
'd
have
a
very
*NL*
small
society
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
frankly
admitted
;
``
and
I
do
n't
think
I
*NL*
like
any
man
or
woman
well
enough
to
recommend
them
to
you
.
When
*NL*
it
comes
to
recommending
it
's
a
serious
affair
.
I
do
n't
like
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
--
everything
about
her
displeases
me
;
she
talks
so
much
*NL*
too
loud
and
looks
at
one
as
if
one
wanted
to
look
at
her
--
which
one
*NL*
does
n't
.
I
'm
sure
she
has
lived
all
her
life
in
a
boarding-house
,
and
I
*NL*
detest
the
manners
and
the
liberties
of
such
places
.
If
you
ask
me
if
I
*NL*
prefer
my
own
manners
,
which
you
doubtless
think
very
bad
,
I
'll
tell
*NL*
you
that
I
prefer
them
immensely
.
Miss
Stackpole
knows
I
detest
*NL*
boarding-house
civilisation
,
and
she
detests
me
for
detesting
it
,
*NL*
because
she
thinks
it
the
highest
in
the
world
.
She
'd
like
Gardencourt
a
*NL*
great
deal
better
if
it
were
a
boarding-house
.
For
me
,
I
find
it
almost
*NL*
too
much
of
one
!
We
shall
never
get
on
together
therefore
,
and
there
's
*NL*
no
use
trying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
was
right
in
guessing
that
Henrietta
disapproved
of
her
,
*NL*
but
she
had
not
quite
put
her
finger
on
the
reason
.
A
day
or
two
after
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
's
arrival
she
had
made
some
invidious
reflexions
on
*NL*
American
hotels
,
which
excited
a
vein
of
counter-argument
on
the
part
*NL*
of
the
correspondent
of
the
Interviewer
,
who
in
the
exercise
of
her
*NL*
profession
had
acquainted
herself
,
in
the
western
world
,
with
every
form
*NL*
of
caravansary
.
Henrietta
expressed
the
opinion
that
American
hotels
*NL*
were
the
best
in
the
world
,
and
Mrs.
Touchett
,
fresh
from
a
renewed
*NL*
struggle
with
them
,
recorded
a
conviction
that
they
were
the
worst
.
*NL*
Ralph
,
with
his
experimental
geniality
,
suggested
,
by
way
of
healing
*NL*
the
breach
,
that
the
truth
lay
between
the
two
extremes
and
that
the
*NL*
establishments
in
question
ought
to
be
described
as
fair
middling
.
This
*NL*
contribution
to
the
discussion
,
however
,
Miss
Stackpole
rejected
with
*NL*
scorn
.
Middling
indeed
!
If
they
were
not
the
best
in
the
world
they
were
*NL*
the
worst
,
but
there
was
nothing
middling
about
an
American
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
judge
from
different
points
of
view
,
evidently
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
.
*NL*
``
I
like
to
be
treated
as
an
individual
;
you
like
to
be
treated
as
a
*NL*
`
party
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
''
Henrietta
replied
.
``
I
like
to
be
treated
*NL*
as
an
American
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
American
ladies
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Touchett
with
a
laugh
.
``
They
're
the
*NL*
slaves
of
slaves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
the
companions
of
freemen
,
''
Henrietta
retorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
the
companions
of
their
servants
--
the
Irish
chambermaid
and
the
*NL*
negro
waiter
.
They
share
their
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
the
domestics
in
an
American
household
`
slaves
'
?
''
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
enquired
.
``
If
that
's
the
way
you
desire
to
treat
them
,
no
*NL*
wonder
you
do
n't
like
America
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
've
not
good
servants
you
're
miserable
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
serenely
*NL*
said
.
``
They
're
very
bad
in
America
,
but
I
've
five
perfect
ones
in
*NL*
Florence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
what
you
want
with
five
,
''
Henrietta
could
n't
help
*NL*
observing
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
should
like
to
see
five
persons
surrounding
*NL*
me
in
that
menial
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
them
in
that
position
better
than
in
some
others
,
''
proclaimed
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
with
much
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
like
me
better
if
I
were
your
butler
,
dear
?
''
her
husband
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
should
:
you
would
n't
at
all
have
the
tenue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
companions
of
freemen
--
I
like
that
,
Miss
Stackpole
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
``
It
's
a
beautiful
description
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
said
freemen
I
did
n't
mean
you
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
was
the
only
reward
that
Ralph
got
for
his
compliment
.
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
was
baffled
;
she
evidently
thought
there
was
something
*NL*
treasonable
in
Mrs.
Touchett
's
appreciation
of
a
class
which
she
*NL*
privately
judged
to
be
a
mysterious
survival
of
feudalism
.
It
was
*NL*
perhaps
because
her
mind
was
oppressed
with
this
image
that
she
suffered
*NL*
some
days
to
elapse
before
she
took
occasion
to
say
to
Isabel
:
``
My
dear
*NL*
friend
,
I
wonder
if
you
're
growing
faithless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faithless
?
Faithless
to
you
,
Henrietta
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
would
be
a
great
pain
;
but
it
's
not
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faithless
to
my
country
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
I
hope
will
never
be
.
When
I
wrote
to
you
from
Liverpool
I
*NL*
said
I
had
something
particular
to
tell
you
.
You
've
never
asked
me
what
*NL*
it
is
.
Is
it
because
you
've
suspected
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suspected
what
?
As
a
rule
I
do
n't
think
I
suspect
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
now
that
phrase
in
your
letter
,
but
I
confess
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
it
.
What
have
you
to
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
looked
disappointed
,
and
her
steady
gaze
betrayed
it
.
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
ask
that
right
--
as
if
you
thought
it
important
.
You
're
*NL*
changed
--
you
're
thinking
of
other
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
what
you
mean
,
and
I
'll
think
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
really
think
of
it
?
That
's
what
I
wish
to
be
sure
of
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
much
control
of
my
thoughts
,
but
I
'll
do
my
best
,
''
said
*NL*
Isabel
.
Henrietta
gazed
at
her
,
in
silence
,
for
a
period
which
tried
*NL*
Isabel
's
patience
,
so
that
our
heroine
added
at
last
:
``
Do
you
mean
that
*NL*
you
're
going
to
be
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
till
I
've
seen
Europe
!
''
said
Miss
Stackpole
.
``
What
are
you
laughing
*NL*
at
?
''
she
went
on
.
``
What
I
mean
is
that
Mr.
Goodwood
came
out
in
the
*NL*
steamer
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
Isabel
responded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
that
right
.
I
had
a
good
deal
of
talk
with
him
;
he
has
come
*NL*
after
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
tell
you
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
told
me
nothing
;
that
's
how
I
knew
it
,
''
said
Henrietta
cleverly
.
*NL*
``
He
said
very
little
about
you
,
but
I
spoke
of
you
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
waited
.
At
the
mention
of
Mr.
Goodwood
's
name
she
had
turned
a
*NL*
little
pale
.
``
I
'm
very
sorry
you
did
that
,
''
she
observed
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
pleasure
to
me
,
and
I
liked
the
way
he
listened

I
could
have
*NL*
talked
a
long
time
to
such
a
listener
;
he
was
so
quiet
,
so
intense
;
he
*NL*
drank
it
all
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
about
me
?

Isabel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
you
were
on
the
whole
the
finest
creature
I
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
sorry
for
that

thinks

well

already

ought
n't
*NL*
to
be
encouraged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
dying
for
a
little
encouragement

I
see
his
face
now

his

earnest
absorbed
look
while
I
talked

I
never
saw
an
ugly
man
look
so
*NL*
handsome

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
very
simple-minded

said
Isabel
.
``
And
he
's
not
so
ugly

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
so
simplifying
as
a
grand
passion

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

not

*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
that

*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
gave
rather
a
cold
smile
.
``
I
shall
say
it
better

Mr.
Goodwood
*NL*
himself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
soon
give
you
a
chance

said
Henrietta
.
Isabel
offered
no
*NL*
answer
to
this
assertion
,
which
her
companion
made
with
an
air
of
great
*NL*
confidence
.
``
He
'll
find
you
changed

the
latter
pursued
.
``
You

been
*NL*
affected

``
Very

affected

*NL*
*NL*
``
By
everything

Mr.

Miss
Stackpole
exclaimed
with
a
*NL*
slightly
harsh
hilarity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
failed
even
to
smile
back
and
in
a
moment
she
said
:
``
Did
he
ask
*NL*
you
to
speak
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
so
many
words

But
his
eyes
asked

his
handshake

*NL*
bade
me
good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
for
doing
so

And
Isabel
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

you
're
changed

you
've
got
new

over
here

her
friend
*NL*
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so

said
Isabel
;
``

possible

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
turned
about
again
.
``
If

mean
that
I
had
any

But
she
faltered
before
her
friend
's
implacable
*NL*
glitter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
child
,
you
certainly
encouraged
him

*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
made
for
the
moment
as
if
to
deny
this
charge
;
instead
of
which
,
*NL*
however
,
she
presently
answered
:
``
It
's
very
true

I
did
encourage
him

*NL*
And
then
she
asked
if
her
companion
had
learned
from
Mr.
Goodwood
*NL*
what
he
intended
to
do
.
It
was
a
concession
to
her
curiosity
,
for
she
*NL*
disliked
discussing
the
subject
and
found
Henrietta
wanting
in
delicacy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
him
,
and
he
said
he
meant
to
do
nothing
,
''
Miss
Stackpole
*NL*
answered
.
``
But
I
do
n't
believe
that

he
's
not
a

bold
action

Whatever
happens
to
him

'll
always
do

something

always
be
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
believe
that

Henrietta
might
be
wanting
in
delicacy
,
but
it
*NL*
touched
the
girl
,
all
the
same
,
to
hear
this
declaration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
do
care
for
him
!
''
her
visitor
rang
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
he
does
will
always
be
right
,
''
Isabel
repeated
.
``
When
a
man
's
*NL*
of
that
infallible
mould
what
does
it
matter
to
him
what
one
feels
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
not
matter
to

it
matters
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
it
matters
to
me

that
's
not
what
we
're
discussing

said
*NL*
Isabel
with
a
cold
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
her
companion
was
grave
.
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
care
;
you
have
*NL*
changed
.
You
're
not
the
girl
you
were
a
few
short
weeks
ago
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Goodwood
will
see
it
.
I
expect
him
here
any
day
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
he
'll
hate
me
then

said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
hope
it
about
as
much
as
I
believe
him
capable
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
observation
our
heroine
made
no
return
;
she
was
absorbed
in
the
*NL*
alarm
given
her
by
Henrietta
's
intimation
that
Caspar
Goodwood
would
*NL*
present
himself
at
Gardencourt
.
She
pretended
to
herself
,
however
,
*NL*
that
she
thought
the
event
impossible
,
and
,
later
,
she
communicated
her
*NL*
disbelief
to
her
friend
.
For
the
next
forty-eight
hours
,
nevertheless
,
*NL*
she
stood
prepared
to
hear
the
young
man
's
name
announced
.
The
feeling
*NL*
pressed
upon
her
;
it
made
the
air
sultry
,
as
if
there
were
to
be
a
*NL*
change
of
weather
;
and
the
weather
,
socially
speaking
,
had
been
so
*NL*
agreeable
during
Isabel
's
stay
at
Gardencourt
that
any
change
would
be
*NL*
for
the
worse
.
Her
suspense
indeed
was
dissipated
the
second
day
.
She
*NL*
had
walked
into
the
park
in
company
with
the
sociable
Bunchie
,
and
*NL*
after
strolling
about
for
some
time
,
in
a
manner
at
once
listless
and
*NL*
restless
,
had
seated
herself
on
a
garden-bench
,
within
sight
of
the
*NL*
house
,
beneath
a
spreading
beech
,
where
,
in
a
white
dress
ornamented
*NL*
with
black
ribbons
,
she
formed
among
the
flickering
shadows
a
graceful
*NL*
and
harmonious
image
.
She
entertained
herself
for
some
moments
with
*NL*
talking
to
the
little
terrier
,
as
to
whom
the
proposal
of
an
ownership
*NL*
divided
with
her
cousin
had
been
applied
as
impartially
as
possible
--
as
*NL*
impartially
as
Bunchie
's
own
somewhat
fickle
and
inconstant
sympathies
*NL*
would
allow
.
But
she
was
notified
for
the
first
time
,
on
this
occasion
,
*NL*
of
the
finite
character
of
Bunchie
's
intellect
;
hitherto
she
had
been
*NL*
mainly
struck
with
its
extent
.
It
seemed
to
her
at
last
that
she
would
*NL*
do
well
to
take
a
book
;
formerly
,
when
heavy-hearted
,
she
had
been
*NL*
able
,
with
the
help
of
some
well-chosen
volume
,
to
transfer
the
seat
*NL*
of
consciousness
to
the
organ
of
pure
reason
.
Of
late
,
it
was
not
to
*NL*
be
denied
,
literature
had
seemed
a
fading
light
,
and
even
after
she
had
*NL*
reminded
herself
that
her
uncle
's
library
was
provided
with
a
complete
*NL*
set
of
those
authors
which
no
gentleman
's
collection
should
be
without
,
*NL*
she
sat
motionless
and
empty-handed
,
her
eyes
bent
on
the
cool
green
*NL*
turf
of
the
lawn
.
Her
meditations
were
presently
interrupted
by
the
*NL*
arrival
of
a
servant
who
handed
her
a
letter
.
The
letter
bore
the
*NL*
London
postmark
and
was
addressed
in
a
hand
she
knew
--
that
came
into
her
*NL*
vision
,
already
so
held
by
him
,
with
the
vividness
of
the
writer
's
voice
*NL*
or
his
face
.
This
document
proved
short
and
may
be
given
entire
.

*NL*
MY
DEAR
MISS
ARCHER
--
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
will
have
heard
of
my
*NL*
coming
to
England
,
but
even
if
you
have
not
it
will
scarcely
be
a
*NL*
surprise
to
you
.
You
will
remember
that
when
you
gave
me
my
dismissal
at
*NL*
Albany
,
three
months
ago
,
I
did
not
accept
it
.
I
protested
against
it
.
*NL*
You
in
fact
appeared
to
accept
my
protest
and
to
admit
that
I
had
the
*NL*
right
on
my
side
.
I
had
come
to
see
you
with
the
hope
that
you
would
*NL*
let
me
bring
you
over
to
my
conviction
;
my
reasons
for
entertaining
this
*NL*
hope
had
been
of
the
best
.
But
you
disappointed
it
;
I
found
you
changed
,
*NL*
and
you
were
able
to
give
me
no
reason
for
the
change
.
You
admitted
that
*NL*
you
were
unreasonable
,
and
it
was
the
only
concession
you
would
make
;
*NL*
but
it
was
a
very
cheap
one
,
because
that
's
not
your
character
.
No
,
you
*NL*
are
not
,
and
you
never
will
be
,
arbitrary
or
capricious
.
Therefore
it
is
*NL*
that
I
believe
you
will
let
me
see
you
again
.
You
told
me
that
I
'm
not
*NL*
disagreeable
to
you
,
and
I
believe
it
;
for
I
do
n't
see
why
that
should
*NL*
be
.
I
shall
always
think
of
you
;
I
shall
never
think
of
any
one
else
.
*NL*
I
came
to
England
simply
because
you
are
here
;
I
could
n't
stay
at
home
*NL*
after
you
had
gone
:
I
hated
the
country
because
you
were
not
in
it
.
If
*NL*
I
like
this
country
at
present
it
is
only
because
it
holds
you
.
I
have
*NL*
been
to
England
before
,
but
have
never
enjoyed
it
much
.
May
I
not
come
*NL*
and
see
you
for
half
an
hour
?
This
at
present
is
the
dearest
wish
of
*NL*
yours
faithfully
,
*NL*
*NL*
CASPAR
GOODWOOD
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
read
this
missive
with
such
deep
attention
that
she
had
not
*NL*
perceived
an
approaching
tread
on
the
soft
grass
.
Looking
up
,
however
,
*NL*
as
she
mechanically
folded
it
she
saw
Lord
Warburton
standing
before
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
the
letter
into
her
pocket
and
offered
her
visitor
a
smile
of
*NL*
welcome
,
exhibiting
no
trace
of
discomposure
and
half
surprised
at
her
*NL*
coolness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
told
me
you
were
out
here
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
;
``
and
as
there
*NL*
was
no
one
in
the
drawing-room
and
it
's
really
you
that
I
wish
to
see
,
I
*NL*
came
out
with
no
more
ado
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
had
got
up
;
she
felt
a
wish
,
for
the
moment
,
that
he
should
not
*NL*
sit
down
beside
her
.
``
I
was
just
going
indoors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
do
that
;
it
's
much
jollier
here
;
I
've
ridden
over
from
*NL*
Lockleigh
;
it
's
a
lovely
day
.
''
His
smile
was
peculiarly
friendly
*NL*
and
pleasing
,
and
his
whole
person
seemed
to
emit
that
radiance
of
*NL*
good-feeling
and
good
fare
which
had
formed
the
charm
of
the
girl
's
*NL*
first
impression
of
him
.
It
surrounded
him
like
a
zone
of
fine
June
*NL*
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
walk
about
a
little
then
,
''
said
Isabel
,
who
could
not
divest
*NL*
herself
of
the
sense
of
an
intention
on
the
part
of
her
visitor
and
who
*NL*
wished
both
to
elude
the
intention
and
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
about
*NL*
it
.
It
had
flashed
upon
her
vision
once
before
,
and
it
had
given
her
on
*NL*
that
occasion
,
as
we
know
,
a
certain
alarm
.
This
alarm
was
composed
of
*NL*
several
elements
,
not
all
of
which
were
disagreeable
;
she
had
indeed
*NL*
spent
some
days
in
analysing
them
and
had
succeeded
in
separating
the
*NL*
pleasant
part
of
the
idea
of
Lord
Warburton
's
``
making
up
''
to
her
from
*NL*
the
painful
.
It
may
appear
to
some
readers
that
the
young
lady
was
both
*NL*
precipitate
and
unduly
fastidious
;
but
the
latter
of
these
facts
,
if
*NL*
the
charge
be
true
,
may
serve
to
exonerate
her
from
the
discredit
of
*NL*
the
former
.
She
was
not
eager
to
convince
herself
that
a
territorial
*NL*
magnate
,
as
she
had
heard
Lord
Warburton
called
,
was
smitten
with
her
*NL*
charms
;
the
fact
of
a
declaration
from
such
a
source
carrying
with
it
*NL*
really
more
questions
than
it
would
answer
.
She
had
received
a
strong
*NL*
impression
of
his
being
a
``
personage
,
''
and
she
had
occupied
herself
in
*NL*
examining
the
image
so
conveyed
.
At
the
risk
of
adding
to
the
evidence
*NL*
of
her
self-sufficiency
it
must
be
said
that
there
had
been
moments
*NL*
when
this
possibility
of
admiration
by
a
personage
represented
to
her
an
*NL*
aggression
almost
to
the
degree
of
an
affront
,
quite
to
the
degree
of
*NL*
an
inconvenience
.
She
had
never
yet
known
a
personage
;
there
had
been
no
*NL*
personages
,
in
this
sense
,
in
her
life
;
there
were
probably
none
such
at
*NL*
all
in
her
native
land
.
When
she
had
thought
of
individual
eminence
she
*NL*
had
thought
of
it
on
the
basis
of
character
and
wit
--
of
what
one
*NL*
might
like
in
a
gentleman
's
mind
and
in
his
talk
.
She
herself
was
a
*NL*
character
--
she
could
n't
help
being
aware
of
that
;
and
hitherto
her
*NL*
visions
of
a
completed
consciousness
had
concerned
themselves
largely
*NL*
with
moral
images
--
things
as
to
which
the
question
would
be
whether
they
*NL*
pleased
her
sublime
soul
.
Lord
Warburton
loomed
up
before
her
,
largely
*NL*
and
brightly
,
as
a
collection
of
attributes
and
powers
which
were
not
to
*NL*
be
measured
by
this
simple
rule
,
but
which
demanded
a
different
sort
of
*NL*
appreciation
--
an
appreciation
that
the
girl
,
with
her
habit
of
judging
*NL*
quickly
and
freely
,
felt
she
lacked
patience
to
bestow
.
He
appeared
to
*NL*
demand
of
her
something
that
no
one
else
,
as
it
were
,
had
presumed
to
*NL*
do
.
What
she
felt
was
that
a
territorial
,
a
political
,
a
social
magnate
*NL*
had
conceived
the
design
of
drawing
her
into
the
system
in
which
he
*NL*
rather
invidiously
lived
and
moved
.
A
certain
instinct
,
not
imperious
,
*NL*
but
persuasive
,
told
her
to
resist
--
murmured
to
her
that
virtually
*NL*
she
had
a
system
and
an
orbit
of
her
own
.
It
told
her
other
things
*NL*
besides
--
things
which
both
contradicted
and
confirmed
each
other
;
that
*NL*
a
girl
might
do
much
worse
than
trust
herself
to
such
a
man
and
that
it
*NL*
would
be
very
interesting
to
see
something
of
his
system
from
his
own
*NL*
point
of
view
;
that
on
the
other
hand
,
however
,
there
was
evidently
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
it
which
she
should
regard
only
as
a
complication
of
every
*NL*
hour
,
and
that
even
in
the
whole
there
was
something
stiff
and
stupid
*NL*
which
would
make
it
a
burden
.
Furthermore
there
was
a
young
man
lately
*NL*
come
from
America
who
had
no
system
at
all
,
but
who
had
a
character
*NL*
of
which
it
was
useless
for
her
to
try
to
persuade
herself
that
the
*NL*
impression
on
her
mind
had
been
light
.
The
letter
she
carried
in
*NL*
her
pocket
all
sufficiently
reminded
her
of
the
contrary
.
Smile
not
,
*NL*
however
,
I
venture
to
repeat
,
at
this
simple
young
woman
from
Albany
who
*NL*
debated
whether
she
should
accept
an
English
peer
before
he
had
offered
*NL*
himself
and
who
was
disposed
to
believe
that
on
the
whole
she
could
do
*NL*
better
.
She
was
a
person
of
great
good
faith
,
and
if
there
was
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
folly
in
her
wisdom
those
who
judge
her
severely
may
have
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
finding
that
,
later
,
she
became
consistently
wise
only
*NL*
at
the
cost
of
an
amount
of
folly
which
will
constitute
almost
a
direct
*NL*
appeal
to
charity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
seemed
quite
ready
to
walk
,
to
sit
or
to
do
anything
that
*NL*
Isabel
should
propose
,
and
he
gave
her
this
assurance
with
his
usual
air
*NL*
of
being
particularly
pleased
to
exercise
a
social
virtue
.
But
he
was
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
not
in
command
of
his
emotions
,
and
as
he
strolled
beside
*NL*
her
for
a
moment
,
in
silence
,
looking
at
her
without
letting
her
know
*NL*
it
,
there
was
something
embarrassed
in
his
glance
and
his
misdirected
*NL*
laughter
.
Yes
,
assuredly
--
as
we
have
touched
on
the
point
,
we
may
return
*NL*
to
it
for
a
moment
again
--
the
English
are
the
most
romantic
people
in
*NL*
the
world
and
Lord
Warburton
was
about
to
give
an
example
of
it
.
He
was
*NL*
about
to
take
a
step
which
would
astonish
all
his
friends
and
displease
*NL*
a
great
many
of
them
,
and
which
had
superficially
nothing
to
recommend
*NL*
it
.
The
young
lady
who
trod
the
turf
beside
him
had
come
from
a
queer
*NL*
country
across
the
sea
which
he
knew
a
good
deal
about
;
her
antecedents
,
*NL*
her
associations
were
very
vague
to
his
mind
except
in
so
far
as
they
*NL*
were
generic
,
and
in
this
sense
they
showed
as
distinct
and
unimportant
.
*NL*
Miss
Archer
had
neither
a
fortune
nor
the
sort
of
beauty
that
justifies
*NL*
a
man
to
the
multitude
,
and
he
calculated
that
he
had
spent
about
*NL*
twenty-six
hours
in
her
company
.
He
had
summed
up
all
this
--
the
*NL*
perversity
of
the
impulse
,
which
had
declined
to
avail
itself
of
the
*NL*
most
liberal
opportunities
to
subside
,
and
the
judgement
of
mankind
,
as
*NL*
exemplified
particularly
in
the
more
quickly-judging
half
of
it
:
he
had
*NL*
looked
these
things
well
in
the
face
and
then
had
dismissed
them
from
*NL*
his
thoughts
.
He
cared
no
more
for
them
than
for
the
rosebud
in
his
*NL*
buttonhole
.
It
is
the
good
fortune
of
a
man
who
for
the
greater
part
of
*NL*
a
lifetime
has
abstained
without
effort
from
making
himself
disagreeable
*NL*
to
his
friends
,
that
when
the
need
comes
for
such
a
course
it
is
not
*NL*
discredited
by
irritating
associations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
had
a
pleasant
ride
,
''
said
Isabel
,
who
observed
her
*NL*
companion
's
hesitancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
have
been
pleasant
if
for
nothing
else
than
that
it
brought
me
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
so
fond
of
Gardencourt
?
''
the
girl
asked
,
more
and
more
sure
*NL*
that
he
meant
to
make
some
appeal
to
her
;
wishing
not
to
challenge
him
*NL*
if
he
hesitated
,
and
yet
to
keep
all
the
quietness
of
her
reason
if
he
*NL*
proceeded
.
It
suddenly
came
upon
her
that
her
situation
was
one
which
a
*NL*
few
weeks
ago
she
would
have
deemed
deeply
romantic
:
the
park
of
an
old
*NL*
English
country-house
,
with
the
foreground
embellished
by
a
``
great
''
-LRB-
as
*NL*
she
supposed
-RRB-
nobleman
in
the
act
of
making
love
to
a
young
lady
who
,
on
*NL*
careful
inspection
,
should
be
found
to
present
remarkable
analogies
with
*NL*
herself
.
But
if
she
was
now
the
heroine
of
the
situation
she
succeeded
*NL*
scarcely
the
less
in
looking
at
it
from
the
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
care
nothing
for
Gardencourt
,
''
said
her
companion
.
``
I
care
only
for
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
known
me
too
short
a
time
to
have
a
right
to
say
that
,
and
I
*NL*
ca
n't
believe
you
're
serious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
of
Isabel
's
were
not
perfectly
sincere
,
for
she
had
no
doubt
*NL*
whatever
that
he
himself
was
.
They
were
simply
a
tribute
to
the
fact
,
of
*NL*
which
she
was
perfectly
aware
,
that
those
he
had
just
uttered
would
*NL*
have
excited
surprise
on
the
part
of
a
vulgar
world
.
And
,
moreover
,
if
*NL*
anything
beside
the
sense
she
had
already
acquired
that
Lord
Warburton
*NL*
was
not
a
loose
thinker
had
been
needed
to
convince
her
,
the
tone
in
*NL*
which
he
replied
would
quite
have
served
the
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
's
right
in
such
a
matter
is
not
measured
by
the
time
,
Miss
Archer
;
*NL*
it
's
measured
by
the
feeling
itself
.
If
I
were
to
wait
three
months
it
*NL*
would
make
no
difference
;
I
shall
not
be
more
sure
of
what
I
mean
than
I
*NL*
am
to-day
.
Of
course
I
've
seen
you
very
little
,
but
my
impression
dates
*NL*
from
the
very
first
hour
we
met
.
I
lost
no
time
,
I
fell
in
love
with
you
*NL*
then
.
It
was
at
first
sight
,
as
the
novels
say
;
I
know
now
that
's
not
a
*NL*
fancy-phrase
,
and
I
shall
think
better
of
novels
for
evermore
.
Those
two
*NL*
days
I
spent
here
settled
it
;
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
suspected
I
was
*NL*
doing
so
,
but
I
paid-mentally
speaking
I
mean
--
the
greatest
possible
*NL*
attention
to
you
.
Nothing
you
said
,
nothing
you
did
,
was
lost
upon
*NL*
me
.
When
you
came
to
Lockleigh
the
other
day
--
or
rather
when
you
went
*NL*
away
--
I
was
perfectly
sure
.
Nevertheless
I
made
up
my
mind
to
think
it
*NL*
over
and
to
question
myself
narrowly
.
I
've
done
so
;
all
these
days
I
've
*NL*
done
nothing
else
.
I
do
n't
make
mistakes
about
such
things
;
I
'm
a
very
*NL*
judicious
animal
.
I
do
n't
go
off
easily
,
but
when
I
'm
touched
,
it
's
*NL*
for
life
.
It
's
for
life
,
Miss
Archer
,
it
's
for
life
,
''
Lord
Warburton
*NL*
repeated
in
the
kindest
,
tenderest
,
pleasantest
voice
Isabel
had
ever
*NL*
heard
,
and
looking
at
her
with
eyes
charged
with
the
light
of
a
passion
*NL*
that
had
sifted
itself
clear
of
the
baser
parts
of
emotion
--
the
heat
,
*NL*
the
violence
,
the
unreason
--
and
that
burned
as
steadily
as
a
lamp
in
a
*NL*
windless
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
tacit
consent
,
as
he
talked
,
they
had
walked
more
and
more
slowly
,
*NL*
and
at
last
they
stopped
and
he
took
her
hand
.
``
Ah
,
Lord
Warburton
,
how
*NL*
little
you
know
me
!
''
Isabel
said
very
gently
.
Gently
too
she
drew
her
*NL*
hand
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
taunt
me
with
that
;
that
I
do
n't
know
you
better
makes
me
unhappy
*NL*
enough
already
;
it
's
all
my
loss
.
But
that
's
what
I
want
,
and
it
seems
*NL*
to
me
I
'm
taking
the
best
way
.
If
you
'll
be
my
wife
,
then
I
shall
know
*NL*
you
,
and
when
I
tell
you
all
the
good
I
think
of
you
you
'll
not
be
able
*NL*
to
say
it
's
from
ignorance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
know
me
little
I
know
you
even
less
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
,
unlike
yourself
,
I
may
not
improve
on
acquaintance
?
Ah
,
*NL*
of
course
that
's
very
possible
.
But
think
,
to
speak
to
you
as
I
do
,
*NL*
how
determined
I
must
be
to
try
and
give
satisfaction
!
You
do
like
me
*NL*
rather
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
you
very
much
,
Lord
Warburton
,
''
she
answered
;
and
at
this
moment
*NL*
she
liked
him
immensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
for
saying
that
;
it
shows
you
do
n't
regard
me
as
a
*NL*
stranger
.
I
really
believe
I
've
filled
all
the
other
relations
of
life
*NL*
very
creditably
,
and
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
n't
fill
this
one
--
in
which
*NL*
I
offer
myself
to
you
--
seeing
that
I
care
so
much
more
about
it
.
Ask
the
*NL*
people
who
know
me
well
;
I
've
friends
who
'll
speak
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
need
the
recommendation
of
your
friends
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
now
,
that
's
delightful
of
you
.
You
believe
in
me
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Completely
,
''
Isabel
declared
.
She
quite
glowed
there
,
inwardly
,
with
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
feeling
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
in
her
companion
's
eyes
turned
into
a
smile
,
and
he
gave
a
*NL*
long
exhalation
of
joy
.
``
If
you
're
mistaken
,
Miss
Archer
,
let
me
lose
*NL*
all
I
possess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
whether
he
meant
this
for
a
reminder
that
he
was
rich
,
and
,
*NL*
on
the
instant
,
felt
sure
that
he
did
n't
.
He
was
thinking
that
,
as
he
*NL*
would
have
said
himself
;
and
indeed
he
might
safely
leave
it
to
the
*NL*
memory
of
any
interlocutor
,
especially
of
one
to
whom
he
was
offering
*NL*
his
hand
.
Isabel
had
prayed
that
she
might
not
be
agitated
,
and
her
mind
*NL*
was
tranquil
enough
,
even
while
she
listened
and
asked
herself
what
it
*NL*
was
best
she
should
say
,
to
indulge
in
this
incidental
criticism
.
What
*NL*
she
should
say
,
had
she
asked
herself
?
Her
foremost
wish
was
to
say
*NL*
something
if
possible
not
less
kind
than
what
he
had
said
to
her
.
His
*NL*
words
had
carried
perfect
conviction
with
them
;
she
felt
she
did
,
all
so
*NL*
mysteriously
,
matter
to
him
.
``
I
thank
you
more
than
I
can
say
for
your
*NL*
offer
,
''
she
returned
at
last
.
``
It
does
me
great
honour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
do
n't
say
that
!
''
he
broke
out
.
``
I
was
afraid
you
'd
say
something
*NL*
like
that
.
I
do
n't
see
what
you
've
to
do
with
that
sort
of
thing
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
why
you
should
thank
me
--
it
's
I
who
ought
to
thank
you
for
*NL*
listening
to
me
:
a
man
you
know
so
little
coming
down
on
you
with
such
*NL*
a
thumper
!
Of
course
it
's
a
great
question
;
I
must
tell
you
that
*NL*
I
'd
rather
ask
it
than
have
it
to
answer
myself
.
But
the
way
you
've
*NL*
listened
--
or
at
least
your
having
listened
at
all
--
gives
me
some
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
hope
too
much
,
''
Isabel
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Miss
Archer
!
''
her
companion
murmured
,
smiling
again
,
in
his
*NL*
seriousness
,
as
if
such
a
warning
might
perhaps
be
taken
but
as
the
play
*NL*
of
high
spirits
,
the
exuberance
of
elation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
be
greatly
surprised
if
I
were
to
beg
you
not
to
hope
at
*NL*
all
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surprised
?
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
surprise
.
It
would
n't
be
that
;
*NL*
it
would
be
a
feeling
very
much
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
walked
on
again
;
she
was
silent
for
some
minutes
.
``
I
'm
very
sure
*NL*
that
,
highly
as
I
already
think
of
you
,
my
opinion
of
you
,
if
I
should
*NL*
know
you
well
,
would
only
rise
.
But
I
'm
by
no
means
sure
that
you
*NL*
would
n't
be
disappointed
.
And
I
say
that
not
in
the
least
out
of
*NL*
conventional
modesty
;
it
's
perfectly
sincere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
willing
to
risk
it
,
Miss
Archer
,
''
her
companion
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
great
question
,
as
you
say
.
It
's
a
very
difficult
question
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
expect
you
of
course
to
answer
it
outright
.
Think
it
over
as
*NL*
long
as
may
be
necessary
.
If
I
can
gain
by
waiting
I
'll
gladly
wait
a
*NL*
long
time
.
Only
remember
that
in
the
end
my
dearest
happiness
depends
on
*NL*
your
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
keep
you
in
suspense
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
mind
.
I
'd
much
rather
have
a
good
answer
six
months
hence
*NL*
than
a
bad
one
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
very
probable
that
even
six
months
hence
I
should
n't
be
able
*NL*
to
give
you
one
that
you
'd
think
good
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
,
since
you
really
like
me
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
must
never
doubt
that
,

said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
I
do
n't
see
what
more
you
ask
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
what
I
ask
;
it
's
what
I
can
give
.
I
do
n't
think
I
should
suit
*NL*
you

I
really
do
n't
think
I
should

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
worry
about
that

That
's
my
affair

royalist
than

king

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
only
that

said
Isabel
;
``
but
I
'm
not
sure
I
wish
to
marry
any
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
you
do
n't
.
I
've
no
doubt
a
great
many
women
begin
that
*NL*
way

said
his
lordship
,
who
,
be
it
averred
,
did
not
in
the
least
*NL*
believe
in
the
axiom
he
thus
beguiled
his
anxiety
by
uttering
.
``
But
*NL*
they
're
frequently
persuaded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
because
they
want
to
be
!
''
And
Isabel
lightly
laughed
.
Her
*NL*
suitor
's
countenance
fell
,
and
he
looked
at
her
for
a
while
in
silence
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
it
's
my
being
an
Englishman
that
makes
you
hesitate
,
''
he
*NL*
said
presently
.
``
I
know
your
uncle
thinks
you
ought
to
marry
in
your
own
*NL*
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
listened
to
this
assertion
with
some
interest
;
it
had
never
*NL*
occurred
to
her
that
Mr.
Touchett
was
likely
to
discuss
her
matrimonial
*NL*
prospects
with
Lord
Warburton
.
``
Has
he
told
you
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
his
making
the
remark
.
He
spoke
perhaps
of
Americans
*NL*
generally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
appears
himself
to
have
found
it
very
pleasant
to
live
in
England
.
''
*NL*
Isabel
spoke
in
a
manner
that
might
have
seemed
a
little
perverse
,
but
*NL*
which
expressed
both
her
constant
perception
of
her
uncle
's
outward
*NL*
felicity
and
her
general
disposition
to
elude
any
obligation
to
take
a
*NL*
restricted
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
gave
her
companion
hope
,
and
he
immediately
cried
with
warmth
:
``
Ah
,
*NL*
my
dear
Miss
Archer
,
old
England
's
a
very
good
sort
of
country
,
you
*NL*
know
!
And
it
will
be
still
better
when
we
've
furbished
it
up
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
furbish
it
,
Lord
Warburton
--
,
leave
it
alone
.
I
like
it
this
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
if
you
like
it
,
I
'm
more
and
more
unable
to
see
your
*NL*
objection
to
what
I
propose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
ca
n't
make
you
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
at
least
to
try
.
I
've
a
fair
intelligence
.
Are
you
*NL*
afraid
--
afraid
of
the
climate
?
We
can
easily
live
elsewhere
,
you
know
.
*NL*
You
can
pick
out
your
climate
,
the
whole
world
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
were
uttered
with
a
breadth
of
candour
that
was
like
the
*NL*
embrace
of
strong
arms
--
that
was
like
the
fragrance
straight
in
her
*NL*
face
,
and
by
his
clean
,
breathing
lips
,
of
she
knew
not
what
strange
*NL*
gardens
,
what
charged
airs
.
She
would
have
given
her
little
finger
at
*NL*
that
moment
to
feel
strongly
and
simply
the
impulse
to
answer
:
``
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
,
it
's
impossible
for
me
to
do
better
in
this
wonderful
world
,
*NL*
I
think
,
than
commit
myself
,
very
gratefully
,
to
your
loyalty
.
''
But
*NL*
though
she
was
lost
in
admiration
of
her
opportunity
she
managed
to
move
*NL*
back
into
the
deepest
shade
of
it
,
even
as
some
wild
,
caught
creature
in
*NL*
a
vast
cage
.
The
``
splendid
''
security
so
offered
her
was
not
the
greatest
*NL*
she
could
conceive
.
What
she
finally
bethought
herself
of
saying
was
*NL*
something
very
different
--
something
that
deferred
the
need
of
really
*NL*
facing
her
crisis
.
``
Do
n't
think
me
unkind
if
I
ask
you
to
say
no
more
*NL*
about
this
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
certainly
!
''
her
companion
cried
.
``
I
would
n't
bore
you
for
*NL*
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
given
me
a
great
deal
to
think
about

and
I
promise
you
to
do
it
*NL*
justice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
I
ask
of
you
,
of
course
--
and
that
you
'll
remember
how
*NL*
absolutely
my
happiness
is
in
your
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
listened
with
extreme
respect
to
this
admonition
,
but
she
said
*NL*
after
a
minute
:
``
I
must
tell
you
that
what
I
shall
think
about
is
some
*NL*
way
of
letting
you
know
that
what
you
ask
is
impossible

letting
you
*NL*
know
it
without
making
you
miserable

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
way
to
do
that

Miss
Archer

I
wo
n't
say
that
if
you
refuse
*NL*
me
you
'll
kill
me
;
I
shall
not
die
of
it

I
shall
do
worse

I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
that
,
please
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
very
gravely
.
``
That
's
fair
*NL*
to
neither
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
marry
a
worse
one
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
are
better
women
than
you
I
prefer
the
bad
ones
.
That
's
all
I
*NL*
can
say
,
''
he
went
on
with
the
same
earnestness
.
``
There
's
no
accounting
*NL*
for
tastes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
gravity
made
her
feel
equally
grave
,
and
she
showed
it
by
again
*NL*
requesting
him
to
drop
the
subject
for
the
present
.
``
I
'll
speak
to
you
*NL*
myself
--
very
soon
.
Perhaps
I
shall
write
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
your
convenience
,
yes
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Whatever
time
you
take
,
it
must
*NL*
seem
to
me
long
,
and
I
suppose
I
must
make
the
best
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
keep
you
in
suspense
;
I
only
want
to
collect
my
mind
a
*NL*
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
a
melancholy
sigh
and
stood
looking
at
her
a
moment
,
with
his
*NL*
hands
behind
him
,
giving
short
nervous
shakes
to
his
hunting-crop
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
know
I
'm
very
much
afraid
of
it
--
of
that
remarkable
mind
of
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
heroine
's
biographer
can
scarcely
tell
why
,
but
the
question
made
*NL*
her
start
and
brought
a
conscious
blush
to
her
cheek
.
She
returned
his
*NL*
look
a
moment
,
and
then
with
a
note
in
her
voice
that
might
almost
have
*NL*
appealed
to
his
compassion
,
``
So
am
I
,
my
lord
!
''
she
oddly
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
compassion
was
not
stirred
,
however
;
all
he
possessed
of
the
faculty
*NL*
of
pity
was
needed
at
home
.
``
Ah
!
be
merciful
,
be
merciful
,
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
had
better
go
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
I
'll
write
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
;
but
whatever
you
write
I
'll
come
and
see
you
,
you
know
.
''
And
*NL*
then
he
stood
reflecting
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
observant
countenance
of
*NL*
Bunchie
,
who
had
the
air
of
having
understood
all
that
had
been
said
*NL*
and
of
pretending
to
carry
off
the
indiscretion
by
a
simulated
fit
of
*NL*
curiosity
as
to
the
roots
of
an
ancient
oak
.
``
There
's
one
thing
more
,
''
*NL*
he
went
on
.
``
You
know
,
if
you
do
n't
like
Lockleigh
--
if
you
think
it
's
*NL*
damp
or
anything
of
that
sort
--
you
need
never
go
within
fifty
miles
of
*NL*
it
.
It
's
not
damp
,
by
the
way
;
I
've
had
the
house
thoroughly
examined
;
*NL*
it
's
perfectly
safe
and
right
.
But
if
you
should
n't
fancy
it
you
need
n't
*NL*
dream
of
living
in
it
.
There
's
no
difficulty
whatever
about
that
;
there
*NL*
are
plenty
of
houses
.
I
thought
I
'd
just
mention
it
;
some
people
do
n't
*NL*
like
a
moat
,
you
know
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
adore
a
moat
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
out
his
hand
,
and
she
gave
him
hers
a
moment
--
a
moment
long
*NL*
enough
for
him
to
bend
his
handsome
bared
head
and
kiss
it
.
Then
,
still
*NL*
agitating
,
in
his
mastered
emotion
,
his
implement
of
the
chase
,
he
*NL*
walked
rapidly
away
.
He
was
evidently
much
upset
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
herself
was
upset
,
but
she
had
not
been
affected
as
she
would
*NL*
have
imagined
.
What
she
felt
was
not
a
great
responsibility
,
a
great
*NL*
difficulty
of
choice
;
it
appeared
to
her
there
had
been
no
choice
in
the
*NL*
question
.
She
could
n't
marry
Lord
Warburton
;
the
idea
failed
to
support
*NL*
any
enlightened
prejudice
in
favour
of
the
free
exploration
of
life
that
*NL*
she
had
hitherto
entertained
or
was
now
capable
of
entertaining
.
*NL*
She
must
write
this
to
him
,
she
must
convince
him
,
and
that
duty
was
*NL*
comparatively
simple
.
But
what
disturbed
her
,
in
the
sense
that
it
*NL*
struck
her
with
wonderment
,
was
this
very
fact
that
it
cost
her
so
*NL*
little
to
refuse
a
magnificent
``
chance
.
''
With
whatever
qualifications
*NL*
one
would
,
Lord
Warburton
had
offered
her
a
great
opportunity
;
the
*NL*
situation
might
have
discomforts
,
might
contain
oppressive
,
might
*NL*
contain
narrowing
elements
,
might
prove
really
but
a
stupefying
anodyne
;
*NL*
but
she
did
her
sex
no
injustice
in
believing
that
nineteen
women
out
of
*NL*
twenty
would
have
accommodated
themselves
to
it
without
a
pang
.
Why
then
*NL*
upon
her
also
should
it
not
irresistibly
impose
itself
?
Who
was
she
,
*NL*
what
was
she
,
that
she
should
hold
herself
superior
?
What
view
of
*NL*
life
,
what
design
upon
fate
,
what
conception
of
happiness
,
had
she
that
*NL*
pretended
to
be
larger
than
these
large
these
fabulous
occasions
?
If
she
*NL*
would
n't
do
such
a
thing
as
that
then
she
must
do
great
things
,
she
must
*NL*
do
something
greater
.
Poor
Isabel
found
ground
to
remind
herself
from
*NL*
time
to
time
that
she
must
not
be
too
proud
,
and
nothing
could
be
*NL*
more
sincere
than
her
prayer
to
be
delivered
from
such
a
danger
:
the
*NL*
isolation
and
loneliness
of
pride
had
for
her
mind
the
horror
of
a
*NL*
desert
place
.
If
it
had
been
pride
that
interfered
with
her
accepting
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
such
a
betise
was
singularly
misplaced
;
and
she
was
so
*NL*
conscious
of
liking
him
that
she
ventured
to
assure
herself
it
was
the
*NL*
very
softness
,
and
the
fine
intelligence
,
of
sympathy
.
She
liked
him
too
*NL*
much
to
marry
him
,
that
was
the
truth
;
something
assured
her
there
was
*NL*
a
fallacy
somewhere
in
the
glowing
logic
of
the
proposition
--
as
he
saw
*NL*
it
--
even
though
she
might
n't
put
her
very
finest
finger-point
on
it
;
*NL*
and
to
inflict
upon
a
man
who
offered
so
much
a
wife
with
a
tendency
to
*NL*
criticise
would
be
a
peculiarly
discreditable
act
.
She
had
promised
him
*NL*
she
would
consider
his
question
,
and
when
,
after
he
had
left
her
,
she
*NL*
wandered
back
to
the
bench
where
he
had
found
her
and
lost
herself
in
*NL*
meditation
,
it
might
have
seemed
that
she
was
keeping
her
vow
.
But
*NL*
this
was
not
the
case
;
she
was
wondering
if
she
were
not
a
cold
,
hard
,
*NL*
priggish
person
,
and
,
on
her
at
last
getting
up
and
going
rather
*NL*
quickly
back
to
the
house
,
felt
,
as
she
had
said
to
her
friend
,
really
*NL*
frightened
at
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
feeling
and
not
the
wish
to
ask
advice
--
she
had
no
desire
*NL*
whatever
for
that
--
that
led
her
to
speak
to
her
uncle
of
what
had
taken
*NL*
place
.
She
wished
to
speak
to
some
one
;
she
should
feel
more
natural
,
*NL*
more
human
,
and
her
uncle
,
for
this
purpose
,
presented
himself
in
a
*NL*
more
attractive
light
than
either
her
aunt
or
her
friend
Henrietta
.
Her
*NL*
cousin
of
course
was
a
possible
confidant
;
but
she
would
have
had
to
do
*NL*
herself
violence
to
air
this
special
secret
to
Ralph
.
So
the
next
day
,
*NL*
after
breakfast
,
she
sought
her
occasion
.
Her
uncle
never
left
his
*NL*
apartment
till
the
afternoon
,
but
he
received
his
cronies
,
as
he
said
,
*NL*
in
his
dressing-room
.
Isabel
had
quite
taken
her
place
in
the
class
*NL*
so
designated
,
which
,
for
the
rest
,
included
the
old
man
's
son
,
his
*NL*
physician
,
his
personal
servant
,
and
even
Miss
Stackpole
.
Mrs.
Touchett
*NL*
did
not
figure
in
the
list
,
and
this
was
an
obstacle
the
less
to
*NL*
Isabel
's
finding
her
host
alone
.
He
sat
in
a
complicated
mechanical
*NL*
chair
,
at
the
open
window
of
his
room
,
looking
westward
over
the
park
*NL*
and
the
river
,
with
his
newspapers
and
letters
piled
up
beside
him
,
*NL*
his
toilet
freshly
and
minutely
made
,
and
his
smooth
,
speculative
face
*NL*
composed
to
benevolent
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
approached
her
point
directly
.
``
I
think
I
ought
to
let
you
know
that
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
.
I
suppose
I
ought
to
tell
my
*NL*
aunt
;
but
it
seems
best
to
tell
you
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
expressed
no
surprise
,
but
thanked
her
for
the
confidence
*NL*
she
showed
him
.
``
Do
you
mind
telling
me
whether
you
accepted
him
?
''
he
*NL*
then
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
answered
him
definitely
yet
;
I
've
taken
a
little
time
to
think
*NL*
of
it
,
because
that
seems
more
respectful
.
But
I
shall
not
accept
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Touchett
made
no
comment
upon
this
;
he
had
the
air
of
thinking
that
,
*NL*
whatever
interest
he
might
take
in
the
matter
from
the
point
of
view
of
*NL*
sociability
,
he
had
no
active
voice
in
it
.
``
Well
,
I
told
you
you
'd
be
a
*NL*
success
over
here
.
Americans
are
highly
appreciated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
highly
indeed
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
But
at
the
cost
of
seeming
both
*NL*
tasteless
and
ungrateful
,
I
do
n't
think
I
can
marry
Lord
Warburton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
her
uncle
went
on
,
``
of
course
an
old
man
ca
n't
judge
for
a
young
*NL*
lady
.
I
'm
glad
you
did
n't
ask
me
before
you
made
up
your
mind
.
I
suppose
*NL*
I
ought
to
tell
you
,
''
he
added
slowly
,
but
as
if
it
were
not
of
much
*NL*
consequence
,
``
that
I
've
known
all
about
it
these
three
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
Lord
Warburton
's
state
of
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
his
intentions
,
as
they
say
here
.
He
wrote
me
a
very
pleasant
*NL*
letter
,
telling
me
all
about
them
.
Should
you
like
to
see
his
letter
?
''
*NL*
the
old
man
obligingly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
I
do
n't
think
I
care
about
that
.
But
I
'm
glad
he
wrote
to
*NL*
you
;
it
was
right
that
he
should
,
and
he
would
be
certain
to
do
what
was
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well
,
I
guess
you
do
like
him
!
''
Mr.
Touchett
declared
.
``
You
need
n't
*NL*
pretend
you
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
him
extremely
;
I
'm
very
free
to
admit
that
.
But
I
do
n't
wish
to
*NL*
marry
any
one
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
some
one
may
come
along
whom
you
may
like
better
.
Well
,
*NL*
that
's
very
likely
,
''
said
Mr.
Touchett
,
who
appeared
to
wish
to
show
his
*NL*
kindness
to
the
girl
by
easing
off
her
decision
,
as
it
were
,
and
finding
*NL*
cheerful
reasons
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
if
I
do
n't
meet
any
one
else
.
I
like
Lord
Warburton
quite
*NL*
well
enough
.
''
she
fell
into
that
appearance
of
a
sudden
change
of
*NL*
point
of
view
with
which
she
sometimes
startled
and
even
displeased
her
*NL*
interlocutors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
uncle
,
however
,
seemed
proof
against
either
of
these
impressions
.
*NL*
``
He
's
a
very
fine
man
,
''
he
resumed
in
a
tone
which
might
have
passed
*NL*
for
that
of
encouragement
.
``
His
letter
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
I
've
*NL*
received
for
some
weeks
.
I
suppose
one
of
the
reasons
I
liked
it
was
*NL*
that
it
was
all
about
you
;
that
is
all
except
the
part
that
was
about
*NL*
himself
.
I
suppose
he
told
you
all
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
have
told
me
everything
I
wished
to
ask
him
,
''
Isabel
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
did
n't
feel
curious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
curiosity
would
have
been
idle
--
once
I
had
determined
to
decline
his
*NL*
offer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
find
it
sufficiently
attractive
?
''
Mr.
Touchett
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
a
little
.
``
I
suppose
it
was
that
,
''
she
presently
*NL*
admitted
.
``
But
I
do
n't
know
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortunately
ladies
are
not
obliged
to
give
reasons
,
''
said
her
uncle
.
*NL*
``
There
's
a
great
deal
that
's
attractive
about
such
an
idea
;
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
see
why
the
English
should
want
to
entice
us
away
from
our
native
land
.
*NL*
I
know
that
we
try
to
attract
them
over
there
,
but
that
's
because
our
*NL*
population
is
insufficient
.
Here
,
you
know
,
they
're
rather
crowded
.
*NL*
However
,
I
presume
there
's
room
for
charming
young
ladies
everywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
seems
to
have
been
room
here
for
you
,
''
said
Isabel
,
whose
eyes
*NL*
had
been
wandering
over
the
large
pleasure-spaces
of
the
park
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Touchett
gave
a
shrewd
,
conscious
smile
.
``
There
's
room
everywhere
,
*NL*
my
dear
,
if
you
'll
pay
for
it
.
I
sometimes
think
I
've
paid
too
much
for
*NL*
this
.
Perhaps
you
also
might
have
to
pay
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
might
,
''
the
girl
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
suggestion
gave
her
something
more
definite
to
rest
on
than
she
*NL*
had
found
in
her
own
thoughts
,
and
the
fact
of
this
association
of
her
*NL*
uncle
's
mild
acuteness
with
her
dilemma
seemed
to
prove
that
she
was
*NL*
concerned
with
the
natural
and
reasonable
emotions
of
life
and
*NL*
not
altogether
a
victim
to
intellectual
eagerness
and
vague
*NL*
ambitions
--
ambitions
reaching
beyond
Lord
Warburton
's
beautiful
appeal
,
*NL*
reaching
to
something
indefinable
and
possibly
not
commendable
.
In
so
*NL*
far
as
the
indefinable
had
an
influence
upon
Isabel
's
behaviour
at
this
*NL*
juncture
,
it
was
not
the
conception
,
even
unformulated
,
of
a
union
with
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
;
for
however
she
might
have
resisted
conquest
at
her
*NL*
English
suitor
's
large
quiet
hands
she
was
at
least
as
far
removed
*NL*
from
the
disposition
to
let
the
young
man
from
Boston
take
positive
*NL*
possession
of
her
.
The
sentiment
in
which
She
sought
refuge
after
*NL*
reading
his
letter
was
a
critical
view
of
his
having
come
abroad
;
for
it
*NL*
was
part
of
the
influence
he
had
upon
her
that
he
seemed
to
deprive
her
*NL*
of
the
sense
of
freedom
.
There
was
a
disagreeably
strong
push
,
a
kind
*NL*
of
hardness
of
presence
,
in
his
way
of
rising
before
her
.
She
had
been
*NL*
haunted
at
moments
by
the
image
,
by
the
danger
,
of
his
disapproval
and
*NL*
had
wondered
--
a
consideration
she
had
never
paid
in
equal
degree
to
any
*NL*
one
else
--
whether
he
would
like
what
she
did
.
The
difficulty
was
that
*NL*
more
than
any
man
she
had
ever
known
,
more
than
poor
Lord
Warburton
-LRB-
she
*NL*
had
begun
now
to
give
his
lordship
the
benefit
of
this
epithet
-RRB-
,
Caspar
*NL*
Goodwood
expressed
for
her
an
energy
--
and
she
had
already
felt
it
as
a
*NL*
power
that
was
of
his
very
nature
.
It
was
in
no
degree
a
matter
of
*NL*
his
``
advantages
''
--
it
was
a
matter
of
the
spirit
that
sat
in
his
*NL*
clear-burning
eyes
like
some
tireless
watcher
at
a
window
.
She
might
*NL*
like
it
or
not
,
but
he
insisted
,
ever
,
with
his
whole
weight
and
force
:
*NL*
even
in
one
's
usual
contact
with
him
one
had
to
reckon
with
that
.
The
*NL*
idea
of
a
diminished
liberty
was
particularly
disagreeable
to
her
at
*NL*
present
,
since
she
had
just
given
a
sort
of
personal
accent
to
her
*NL*
independence
by
looking
so
straight
at
Lord
Warburton
's
big
bribe
and
*NL*
yet
turning
away
from
it
.
Sometimes
Caspar
Goodwood
had
seemed
to
range
*NL*
himself
on
the
side
of
her
destiny
,
to
be
the
stubbornest
fact
she
knew
;
*NL*
she
said
to
herself
at
such
moments
that
she
might
evade
him
for
a
time
,
*NL*
but
that
she
must
make
terms
with
him
at
last
--
terms
which
would
be
*NL*
certain
to
be
favourable
to
himself
.
Her
impulse
had
been
to
avail
*NL*
herself
of
the
things
that
helped
her
to
resist
such
an
obligation
;
*NL*
and
this
impulse
had
been
much
concerned
in
her
eager
acceptance
of
her
*NL*
aunt
's
invitation
,
which
had
come
to
her
at
an
hour
when
she
expected
*NL*
from
day
to
day
to
see
Mr.
Goodwood
and
when
she
was
glad
to
have
an
*NL*
answer
ready
for
something
she
was
sure
he
would
say
to
her
.
When
she
*NL*
had
told
him
at
Albany
,
on
the
evening
of
Mrs.
Touchett
's
visit
,
that
*NL*
she
could
n't
then
discuss
difficult
questions
,
dazzled
as
she
was
by
*NL*
the
great
immediate
opening
of
her
aunt
's
offer
of
``
Europe
,
''
he
declared
*NL*
that
this
was
no
answer
at
all
;
and
it
was
now
to
obtain
a
better
one
*NL*
that
he
was
following
her
across
the
sea
.
To
say
to
herself
that
he
was
*NL*
a
kind
of
grim
fate
was
well
enough
for
a
fanciful
young
woman
who
was
*NL*
able
to
take
much
for
granted
in
him
;
but
the
reader
has
a
right
to
a
*NL*
nearer
and
a
clearer
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
the
son
of
a
proprietor
of
well-known
cotton-mills
in
*NL*
Massachusetts
--
a
gentleman
who
had
accumulated
a
considerable
fortune
in
*NL*
the
exercise
of
this
industry
.
Caspar
at
present
managed
the
works
,
and
*NL*
with
a
judgement
and
a
temper
which
,
in
spite
of
keen
competition
and
*NL*
languid
years
,
had
kept
their
prosperity
from
dwindling
.
He
had
received
*NL*
the
better
part
of
his
education
at
Harvard
College
,
where
,
however
,
he
*NL*
had
gained
renown
rather
as
a
gymnast
and
an
oarsman
than
as
a
gleaner
*NL*
of
more
dispersed
knowledge
.
Later
on
he
had
learned
that
the
finer
*NL*
intelligence
too
could
vault
and
pull
and
strain
--
might
even
,
breaking
*NL*
the
record
,
treat
itself
to
rare
exploits
.
He
had
thus
discovered
in
*NL*
himself
a
sharp
eye
for
the
mystery
of
mechanics
,
and
had
invented
an
*NL*
improvement
in
the
cotton-spinning
process
which
was
now
largely
used
*NL*
and
was
known
by
his
name
.
You
might
have
seen
it
in
the
newspapers
in
*NL*
connection
with
this
fruitful
contrivance
;
assurance
of
which
he
*NL*
had
given
to
Isabel
by
showing
her
in
the
columns
of
the
New
York
*NL*
Interviewer
an
exhaustive
article
on
the
Goodwood
patent
--
an
article
not
*NL*
prepared
by
Miss
Stackpole
,
friendly
as
she
had
proved
herself
to
his
*NL*
more
sentimental
interests
.
There
were
intricate
,
bristling
things
he
*NL*
rejoiced
in
;
he
liked
to
organise
,
to
contend
,
to
administer
;
he
could
*NL*
make
people
work
his
will
,
believe
in
him
,
march
before
him
and
justify
*NL*
him
.
This
was
the
art
,
as
they
said
,
of
managing
men
--
which
rested
,
in
*NL*
him
,
further
,
on
a
bold
though
brooding
ambition
.
It
struck
those
*NL*
who
knew
him
well
that
he
might
do
greater
things
than
carry
on
a
*NL*
cotton-factory
;
there
was
nothing
cottony
about
Caspar
Goodwood
,
and
*NL*
his
friends
took
for
granted
that
he
would
somehow
and
somewhere
*NL*
write
himself
in
bigger
letters
.
But
it
was
as
if
something
large
and
*NL*
confused
,
something
dark
and
ugly
,
would
have
to
call
upon
him
:
he
was
*NL*
not
after
all
in
harmony
with
mere
smug
peace
and
greed
and
gain
,
an
*NL*
order
of
things
of
which
the
vital
breath
was
ubiquitous
advertisement
.
*NL*
It
pleased
Isabel
to
believe
that
he
might
have
ridden
,
on
a
plunging
*NL*
steed
,
the
whirlwind
of
a
great
war
--
a
war
like
the
Civil
strife
that
*NL*
had
overdarkened
her
conscious
childhood
and
his
ripening
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
liked
at
any
rate
this
idea
of
his
being
by
character
and
in
fact
a
*NL*
mover
of
men
--
liked
it
much
better
than
some
other
points
in
his
nature
*NL*
and
aspect
.
She
cared
nothing
for
his
cotton-mill
--
the
Goodwood
patent
*NL*
left
her
imagination
absolutely
cold
.
She
wished
him
no
ounce
less
of
*NL*
his
manhood
,
but
she
sometimes
thought
he
would
be
rather
nicer
if
he
*NL*
looked
,
for
instance
,
a
little
differently
.
His
jaw
was
too
square
and
*NL*
set
and
his
figure
too
straight
and
stiff
:
these
things
suggested
a
want
*NL*
of
easy
consonance
with
the
deeper
rhythms
of
life
.
Then
she
viewed
with
*NL*
reserve
a
habit
he
had
of
dressing
always
in
the
same
manner
;
it
was
*NL*
not
apparently
that
he
wore
the
same
clothes
continually
,
for
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
his
garments
had
a
way
of
looking
rather
too
new
.
But
they
all
*NL*
seemed
of
the
same
piece
;
the
figure
,
the
stuff
,
was
so
drearily
usual
.
*NL*
She
had
reminded
herself
more
than
once
that
this
was
a
frivolous
*NL*
objection
to
a
person
of
his
importance
;
and
then
she
had
amended
the
*NL*
rebuke
by
saying
that
it
would
be
a
frivolous
objection
only
if
she
*NL*
were
in
love
with
him
.
She
was
not
in
love
with
him
and
therefore
might
*NL*
criticise
his
small
defects
as
well
as
his
great
--
which
latter
consisted
*NL*
in
the
collective
reproach
of
his
being
too
serious
,
or
,
rather
,
not
of
*NL*
his
being
so
,
since
one
could
never
be
,
but
certainly
of
his
seeming
so
.
*NL*
He
showed
his
appetites
and
designs
too
simply
and
artlessly
;
when
one
*NL*
was
alone
with
him
he
talked
too
much
about
the
same
subject
,
and
when
*NL*
other
people
were
present
he
talked
too
little
about
anything
.
And
yet
*NL*
he
was
of
supremely
strong
,
clean
make
--
which
was
so
much
she
saw
the
*NL*
different
fitted
parts
of
him
as
she
had
seen
,
in
museums
and
portraits
,
*NL*
the
different
fitted
parts
of
armoured
warriors
--
in
plates
of
steel
*NL*
handsomely
inlaid
with
gold
.
It
was
very
strange
:
where
,
ever
,
was
any
*NL*
tangible
link
between
her
impression
and
her
act
?
Caspar
Goodwood
had
*NL*
never
corresponded
to
her
idea
of
a
delightful
person
,
and
she
supposed
*NL*
that
this
was
why
he
left
her
so
harshly
critical
.
When
,
however
,
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
,
who
not
only
did
correspond
with
it
,
but
gave
an
extension
to
*NL*
the
term
,
appealed
to
her
approval
,
she
found
herself
still
unsatisfied
.
*NL*
It
was
certainly
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sense
of
her
incoherence
was
not
a
help
to
answering
Mr.
Goodwood
's
*NL*
letter
,
and
Isabel
determined
to
leave
it
a
while
unhonoured
.
If
he
*NL*
had
determined
to
persecute
her
he
must
take
the
consequences
;
foremost
*NL*
among
which
was
his
being
left
to
perceive
how
little
it
charmed
her
*NL*
that
he
should
come
down
to
Gardencourt
.
She
was
already
liable
to
the
*NL*
incursions
of
one
suitor
at
this
place
,
and
though
it
might
be
pleasant
*NL*
to
be
appreciated
in
opposite
quarters
there
was
a
kind
of
grossness
in
*NL*
entertaining
two
such
passionate
pleaders
at
once
,
even
in
a
case
where
*NL*
the
entertainment
should
consist
of
dismissing
them
.
She
made
no
*NL*
reply
to
Mr.
Goodwood
;
but
at
the
end
of
three
days
she
wrote
to
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
,
and
the
letter
belongs
to
our
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
DEAR
LORD
WARBURTON
--
A
great
deal
of
earnest
thought
has
not
led
me
to
*NL*
change
my
mind
about
the
suggestion
you
were
so
kind
as
to
make
me
the
*NL*
other
day
.
I
am
not
,
I
am
really
and
truly
not
,
able
to
regard
you
*NL*
in
the
light
of
a
companion
for
life
;
or
to
think
of
your
home
--
your
*NL*
various
homes
--
as
the
settled
seat
of
my
existence
.
These
things
can
not
*NL*
be
reasoned
about
,
and
I
very
earnestly
entreat
you
not
to
return
to
*NL*
the
subject
we
discussed
so
exhaustively
.
We
see
our
lives
from
our
own
*NL*
point
of
view
;
that
is
the
privilege
of
the
weakest
and
humblest
of
us
;
*NL*
and
I
shall
never
be
able
to
see
mine
in
the
manner
you
proposed
.
Kindly
*NL*
let
this
suffice
you
,
and
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
that
I
have
given
*NL*
your
proposal
the
deeply
respectful
consideration
it
deserves
.
It
is
*NL*
with
this
very
great
regard
that
I
remain
sincerely
yours
,
*NL*
*NL*
ISABEL
ARCHER
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
author
of
this
missive
was
making
up
her
mind
to
dispatch
it
*NL*
Henrietta
Stackpole
formed
a
resolve
which
was
accompanied
by
no
demur
.
*NL*
She
invited
Ralph
Touchett
to
take
a
walk
with
her
in
the
garden
,
and
*NL*
when
he
had
assented
with
that
alacrity
which
seemed
constantly
to
*NL*
testify
to
his
high
expectations
,
she
informed
him
that
she
had
a
favour
*NL*
to
ask
of
him
.
It
may
be
admitted
that
at
this
information
the
young
man
*NL*
flinched
;
for
we
know
that
Miss
Stackpole
had
struck
him
as
apt
to
push
*NL*
an
advantage
.
The
alarm
was
unreasoned
,
however
;
for
he
was
clear
about
*NL*
the
area
of
her
indiscretion
as
little
as
advised
of
its
vertical
depth
,
*NL*
and
he
made
a
very
civil
profession
of
the
desire
to
serve
her
.
He
*NL*
was
afraid
of
her
and
presently
told
her
so
.
``
When
you
look
at
me
in
a
*NL*
certain
way
my
knees
knock
together
,
my
faculties
desert
me
;
I
'm
filled
*NL*
with
trepidation
and
I
ask
only
for
strength
to
execute
your
commands
.
*NL*
You
've
an
address
that
I
've
never
encountered
in
any
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Henrietta
replied
good-humouredly
,
``
if
I
had
not
known
before
*NL*
that
you
were
trying
somehow
to
abash
me
I
should
know
it
now
.
Of
course
*NL*
I
'm
easy
game
--
I
was
brought
up
with
such
different
customs
and
ideas
.
*NL*
I
'm
not
used
to
your
arbitrary
standards
,
and
I
've
never
been
spoken
to
*NL*
in
America
as
you
have
spoken
to
me
.
If
a
gentleman
conversing
with
me
*NL*
over
there
were
to
speak
to
me
like
that
I
should
n't
know
what
to
make
*NL*
of
it
.
We
take
everything
more
naturally
over
there
,
and
,
after
all
,
*NL*
we
're
a
great
deal
more
simple
.
I
admit
that
;
I
'm
very
simple
myself
.
*NL*
Of
course
if
you
choose
to
laugh
at
me
for
it
you
're
very
welcome
;
but
I
*NL*
think
on
the
whole
I
would
rather
be
myself
than
you
.
I
'm
quite
content
*NL*
to
be
myself
;
I
do
n't
want
to
change
.
There
are
plenty
of
people
that
*NL*
appreciate
me
just
as
I
am
.
It
's
true
they
're
nice
fresh
free-born
*NL*
Americans
!
''
Henrietta
had
lately
taken
up
the
tone
of
helpless
innocence
*NL*
and
large
concession
.
``
I
want
you
to
assist
me
a
little
,
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
in
the
least
whether
I
amuse
you
while
you
do
so
;
or
,
*NL*
rather
,
I
'm
perfectly
willing
your
amusement
should
be
your
reward
.
I
*NL*
want
you
to
help
me
about
Isabel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
injured
you
?
''
Ralph
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
had
I
should
n't
mind
,
and
I
should
never
tell
you
.
What
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
of
is
that
she
'll
injure
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
's
very
possible
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
stopped
in
the
garden-walk
,
fixing
on
him
perhaps
the
very
*NL*
gaze
that
unnerved
him
.
``
That
too
would
amuse
you
,
I
suppose
.
The
way
*NL*
you
do
say
things
!
I
never
heard
any
one
so

taking

turning
away

Henrietta
replied

*NL*
``
Ah

I
see
,

cried
Ralph
;
``
and
to
prevent

you
want

to
step
in

marry
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
;
that
remedy
would
be
as
bad
as

you
're
the
*NL*
typical
,
the
fell
European
from
whom
I
wish
to
rescue
her

No
;
I
wish
*NL*
you
to
take
an
interest
in
another
person
--
a
young
man
to
whom
she
once
*NL*
gave
great
encouragement
and
whom
she
now
does
n't
seem
to
think
good
*NL*
enough

He
's
a
thoroughly
grand
man
and
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
,
and
*NL*
I
wish
very
much
you
would
invite
him
to
pay
a
visit
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
was
much
puzzled
by
this
appeal
,
and
it
is
perhaps
not
to
the
*NL*
credit
of
his
purity
of
mind
that
he
failed
to
look
at
it
at
first
in
*NL*
the
simplest
light
.
It
wore
,
to
his
eyes
,
a
tortuous
air
,
and
his
fault
*NL*
was
that
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
anything
in
the
world
could
really
*NL*
be
as
candid
as
this
request
of
Miss
Stackpole
's
appeared
.
That
a
young
*NL*
woman
should
demand
that
a
gentleman
whom
she
described
as
her
very
dear
*NL*
friend
should
be
furnished
with
an
opportunity
to
make
himself
agreeable
*NL*
to
another
young
woman
,
a
young
woman
whose
attention
had
wandered
and
*NL*
whose
charms
were
greater
--
this
was
an
anomaly
which
for
the
moment
*NL*
challenged
all
his
ingenuity
of
interpretation
.
To
read
between
the
*NL*
lines
was
easier
than
to
follow
the
text
,
and
to
suppose
that
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
wished
the
gentleman
invited
to
Gardencourt
on
her
own
account
*NL*
was
the
sign
not
so
much
of
a
vulgar
as
of
an
embarrassed
mind
.
Even
*NL*
from
this
venial
act
of
vulgarity
,
however
,
Ralph
was
saved
,
and
saved
*NL*
by
a
force
that
I
can
only
speak
of
as
inspiration
.
With
no
more
outward
*NL*
light
on
the
subject
than
he
already
possessed
he
suddenly
acquired
the
*NL*
conviction
that
it
would
be
a
sovereign
injustice
to
the
correspondent
*NL*
of
the
Interviewer
to
assign
a
dishonourable
motive
to
any
act
of
hers
.
*NL*
This
conviction
passed
into
his
mind
with
extreme
rapidity
;
it
was
*NL*
perhaps
kindled
by
the
pure
radiance
of
the
young
lady
's
imperturbable
*NL*
gaze
.
He
returned
this
challenge
a
moment
,
consciously
,
resisting
an
*NL*
inclination
to
frown
as
one
frowns
in
the
presence
of
larger
luminaries
.
*NL*
``
Who
's
the
gentleman
you
speak
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Caspar
Goodwood
--
of
Boston
.
He
has
been
extremely
attentive
to
*NL*
Isabel

just
as
devoted
to
her
as
he
can
live
.
He
has
followed
her
out
*NL*
here
and
he
's
at
present
in
London

I
do
n't
know
his
address

I
*NL*
guess
I
can
obtain
it

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

that
's
no
reason
why
Isabel

*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
gave
a
mild
ambiguous

acceptable

These
last
words
of
Miss
Stackpole
's
-LRB-
on
which
the
two
presently
*NL*
separated
-RRB-
contained
an
amount
of
truth
which
Ralph
Touchett
was
obliged
*NL*
to
recognise
;
but
it
so
far
took
the
edge
from
too
sharp
a
recognition
*NL*
that
,
in
spite
of
his
suspecting
it
would
be
rather
more
indiscreet
*NL*
to
keep
than
to
break
his
promise
,
he
wrote
Mr.
Goodwood
a
note
of
six
*NL*
lines
,
expressing
the
pleasure
it
would
give
Mr.
Touchett
the
elder
that
*NL*
he
should
join
a
little
party
at
Gardencourt
,
of
which
Miss
Stackpole
*NL*
was
a
valued
member
.
Having
sent
his
letter
-LRB-
to
the
care
of
a
banker
*NL*
whom
Henrietta
suggested
-RRB-
he
waited
in
some
suspense
.
He
had
heard
this
*NL*
fresh
formidable
figure
named
for
the
first
time
;
for
when
his
mother
*NL*
had
mentioned
on
her
arrival
that
there
was
a
story
about
the
girl
's
*NL*
having
an
``
admirer
''
at
home
,
the
idea
had
seemed
deficient
in
reality
*NL*
and
he
had
taken
no
pains
to
ask
questions
the
answers
to
which
would
*NL*
involve
only
the
vague
or
the
disagreeable
.
Now
,
however
,
the
native
*NL*
admiration
of
which
his
cousin
was
the
object
had
become
more
concrete
;
*NL*
it
took
the
form
of
a
young
man
who
had
followed
her
to
London
,
who
was
*NL*
interested
in
a
cotton-mill
and
had
manners
in
the
most
splendid
of
the
*NL*
American
styles
.
Ralph
had
two
theories
about
this
intervenes
.
Either
*NL*
his
passion
was
a
sentimental
fiction
of
Miss
Stackpole
's
-LRB-
there
was
*NL*
always
a
sort
of
tacit
understanding
among
women
,
born
of
the
solidarity
*NL*
of
the
sex
,
that
they
should
discover
or
invent
lovers
for
each
other
-RRB-
,
*NL*
in
which
case
he
was
not
to
be
feared
and
would
probably
not
accept
the
*NL*
invitation
;
or
else
he
would
accept
the
invitation
and
in
this
event
*NL*
prove
himself
a
creature
too
irrational
to
demand
further
consideration
.
*NL*
The
latter
clause
of
Ralph
's
argument
might
have
seemed
incoherent
;
*NL*
but
it
embodied
his
conviction
that
if
Mr.
Goodwood
were
interested
in
*NL*
Isabel
in
the
serious
manner
described
by
Miss
Stackpole
he
would
not
*NL*
care
to
present
himself
at
Gardencourt
on
a
summons
from
the
latter
*NL*
lady
.
``
On
this
supposition
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
he
must
regard
her
as
a
thorn
*NL*
on
the
stem
of
his
rose
;
as
an
intercessor
he
must
find
her
wanting
in
*NL*
tact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
after
he
had
sent
his
invitation
he
received
a
very
short
*NL*
note
from
Caspar
Goodwood
,
thanking
him
for
it
,
regretting
that
other
*NL*
engagements
made
a
visit
to
Gardencourt
impossible
and
presenting
many
*NL*
compliments
to
Miss
Stackpole
.
Ralph
handed
the
note
to
Henrietta
,
who
,
*NL*
when
she
had
read
it
,
exclaimed
:
``
Well
,
I
never
have
heard
of
anything
*NL*
so
stiff
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
he
does
n't
care
so
much
about
my
cousin
as
you
suppose
,
''
*NL*
Ralph
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
not
that
;
it
's
some
subtler
motive
.
His
nature
's
very
deep
.
*NL*
But
I
'm
determined
to
fathom
it
,
and
I
shall
write
to
him
to
know
what
*NL*
he
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
refusal
of
Ralph
's
overtures
was
vaguely
disconcerting
;
from
the
*NL*
moment
he
declined
to
come
to
Gardencourt
our
friend
began
to
think
*NL*
him
of
importance
.
He
asked
himself
what
it
signified
to
him
whether
*NL*
Isabel
's
admirers
should
be
desperadoes
or
laggards
;
they
were
not
*NL*
rivals
of
his
and
were
perfectly
welcome
to
act
out
their
genius
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
he
felt
much
curiosity
as
to
the
result
of
Miss
Stackpole
's
*NL*
promised
enquiry
into
the
causes
of
Mr.
Goodwood
's
stiffness
--
a
*NL*
curiosity
for
the
present
ungratified
,
inasmuch
as
when
he
asked
her
*NL*
three
days
later
if
she
had
written
to
London
she
was
obliged
to
confess
*NL*
she
had
written
in
vain
.
Mr.
Goodwood
had
not
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
he
's
thinking
it
over
,
''
she
said
;
``
he
thinks
everything
*NL*
over
;
he
's
not
really
at
all
impetuous
.
But
I
'm
accustomed
to
having
my
*NL*
letters
answered
the
same
day
.
''
She
presently
proposed
to
Isabel
,
at
*NL*
all
events
,
that
they
should
make
an
excursion
to
London
together
.
``
If
I
*NL*
must
tell
the
truth
,
''
she
observed
,
``
I
'm
not
seeing
much
at
this
*NL*
place
,
and
I
should
n't
think
you
were
either
.
I
've
not
even
seen
that
*NL*
aristocrat
--
what
's
his
name
?
--
Lord
Washburton
.
He
seems
to
let
you
*NL*
severely
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
Warburton
's
coming
to-morrow
,
I
happen
to
know
,
''
replied
her
*NL*
friend
,
who
had
received
a
note
from
the
master
of
Lockleigh
in
answer
*NL*
to
her
own
letter
.
``
You
'll
have
every
opportunity
of
turning
him
inside
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
may
do
for
one
letter
,
but
what
's
one
letter
when
you
want
to
*NL*
write
fifty
?
I
've
described
all
the
scenery
in
this
vicinity
and
raved
*NL*
about
all
the
old
women
and
donkeys
.
You
may
say
what
you
please
,
*NL*
scenery
does
n't
make
a
vital
letter
.
I
must
go
back
to
London
and
get
*NL*
some
impressions
of
real
life
.
I
was
there
but
three
days
before
I
came
*NL*
away
,
and
that
's
hardly
time
to
get
in
touch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Isabel
,
on
her
journey
from
New
York
to
Gardencourt
,
had
seen
even
*NL*
less
of
the
British
capital
than
this
,
it
appeared
a
happy
suggestion
of
*NL*
Henrietta
's
that
the
two
should
go
thither
on
a
visit
of
pleasure
.
The
*NL*
idea
struck
Isabel
as
charming
;
he
was
curious
of
the
thick
detail
of
*NL*
London
,
which
had
always
loomed
large
and
rich
to
her
.
They
turned
over
*NL*
their
schemes
together
and
indulged
in
visions
of
romantic
hours
.
They
*NL*
would
stay
at
some
picturesque
old
inn
--
one
of
the
inns
described
by
*NL*
Dickens
--
and
drive
over
the
town
in
those
delightful
hansoms
.
Henrietta
*NL*
was
a
literary
woman
,
and
the
great
advantage
of
being
a
literary
woman
*NL*
was
that
you
could
go
everywhere
and
do
everything
.
They
would
dine
at
*NL*
a
coffee-house
and
go
afterwards
to
the
play
;
they
would
frequent
the
*NL*
Abbey
and
the
British
Museum
and
find
out
where
Doctor
Johnson
had
*NL*
lived
,
and
Goldsmith
and
Addison
.
Isabel
grew
eager
and
presently
*NL*
unveiled
the
bright
vision
to
Ralph
,
who
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
*NL*
which
scarce
expressed
the
sympathy
she
had
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
delightful
plan
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
advise
you
to
go
to
the
Duke
's
*NL*
Head
in
Covent
Garden
,
an
easy
,
informal
,
old-fashioned
place
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
have
you
put
down
at
my
club
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
it
's
improper
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
``
Dear
me
,
is
n't
anything
*NL*
proper
here
?
With
Henrietta
surely
I
may
go
anywhere
;
she
is
n't
hampered
*NL*
in
that
way
.
She
has
travelled
over
the
whole
American
continent
and
can
*NL*
at
least
find
her
way
about
this
minute
island
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
let
me
take
advantage
of
her
protection
to
go
up
*NL*
to
town
as
well
.
I
may
never
have
a
chance
to
travel
so
safely
!

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
would
have
prepared
to
start
immediately
;
but
Isabel
,
as
*NL*
we
have
seen
,
had
been
notified
that
Lord
Warburton
would
come
again
to
*NL*
Gardencourt
,
and
she
believed
it
her
duty
to
remain
there
and
see
him
.
*NL*
For
four
or
five
days
he
had
made
no
response
to
her
letter
;
then
he
had
*NL*
written
,
very
briefly
,
to
say
he
would
come
to
luncheon
two
days
later
.
*NL*
There
was
something
in
these
delays
and
postponements
that
touched
the
*NL*
girl
and
renewed
her
sense
of
his
desire
to
be
considerate
and
patient
,
*NL*
not
to
appear
to
urge
her
too
grossly
;
a
consideration
the
more
studied
*NL*
that
she
was
so
sure
he
``
really
liked
''
her
.
Isabel
told
her
uncle
she
*NL*
had
written
to
him
,
mentioning
also
his
intention
of
coming
;
and
the
*NL*
old
man
,
in
consequence
,
left
his
room
earlier
than
usual
and
made
his
*NL*
appearance
at
the
two
o'clock
repast
.
This
was
by
no
means
an
act
of
*NL*
vigilance
on
his
part
,
but
the
fruit
of
a
benevolent
belief
that
his
*NL*
being
of
the
company
might
help
to
cover
any
conjoined
straying
away
*NL*
in
case
Isabel
should
give
their
noble
visitor
another
hearing
.
That
*NL*
personage
drove
over
from
Lockleigh
and
brought
the
elder
of
his
sisters
*NL*
with
him
,
a
measure
presumably
dictated
by
reflexions
of
the
same
order
*NL*
as
Mr.
Touchett
's
.
The
two
visitors
were
introduced
to
Miss
Stackpole
,
*NL*
who
,
at
luncheon
,
occupied
a
seat
adjoining
Lord
Warburton
's
.
Isabel
,
*NL*
who
was
nervous
and
had
no
relish
for
the
prospect
of
again
arguing
*NL*
the
question
he
had
so
prematurely
opened
,
could
not
help
admiring
his
*NL*
good-humoured
self-possession
,
which
quite
disguised
the
symptoms
of
*NL*
that
preoccupation
with
her
presence
it
was
natural
she
should
suppose
*NL*
him
to
feel
.
He
neither
looked
at
her
nor
spoke
to
her
,
and
the
only
*NL*
sign
of
his
emotion
was
that
he
avoided
meeting
her
eyes
.
He
had
plenty
*NL*
of
talk
for
the
others
,
however
,
and
he
appeared
to
eat
his
luncheon
*NL*
with
discrimination
and
appetite
.
Miss
Molyneux
,
who
had
a
smooth
,
*NL*
nun-like
forehead
and
wore
a
large
silver
cross
suspended
from
her
neck
,
*NL*
was
evidently
preoccupied
with
Henrietta
Stackpole
,
upon
whom
her
*NL*
eyes
constantly
rested
in
a
manner
suggesting
a
conflict
between
deep
*NL*
alienation
and
yearning
wonder
.
Of
the
two
ladies
from
Lockleigh
she
*NL*
was
the
one
Isabel
had
liked
best
;
there
was
such
a
world
of
hereditary
*NL*
quiet
in
her
.
Isabel
was
sure
moreover
that
her
mild
forehead
and
*NL*
silver
cross
referred
to
some
weird
Anglican
mystery
--
some
delightful
*NL*
reinstitution
perhaps
of
the
quaint
office
of
the
canoness
.
She
wondered
*NL*
what
Miss
Molyneux
would
think
of
her
if
she
knew
Miss
Archer
had
*NL*
refused
her
brother
;
and
then
she
felt
sure
that
Miss
Molyneux
would
*NL*
never
know
--
that
Lord
Warburton
never
told
her
such
things
.
He
was
fond
*NL*
of
her
and
kind
to
her
,
but
on
the
whole
he
told
her
little
.
Such
,
at
*NL*
least
,
was
Isabel
's
theory
;
when
,
at
table
,
she
was
not
occupied
in
*NL*
conversation
she
was
usually
occupied
in
forming
theories
about
her
*NL*
neighbours
.
According
to
Isabel
,
if
Miss
Molyneux
should
ever
learn
what
*NL*
had
passed
between
Miss
Archer
and
Lord
Warburton
she
would
probably
be
*NL*
shocked
at
such
a
girl
's
failure
to
rise
;
or
no
,
rather
-LRB-
this
was
our
*NL*
heroine
's
last
position
-RRB-
she
would
impute
to
the
young
American
but
a
*NL*
due
consciousness
of
inequality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
Isabel
might
have
made
of
her
opportunities
,
at
all
events
,
*NL*
Henrietta
Stackpole
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
neglect
those
in
which
*NL*
she
now
found
herself
immersed
.
``
Do
you
know
you
're
the
first
lord
I
've
*NL*
ever
seen
?
''
she
said
very
promptly
to
her
neighbour
.
``
I
suppose
you
*NL*
think
I
'm
awfully
benighted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
escaped
seeing
some
very
ugly
men
,
''
Lord
Warburton
answered
,
*NL*
looking
a
trifle
absently
about
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
very
ugly
?
They
try
to
make
us
believe
in
America
that
they
're
*NL*
all
handsome
and
magnificent
and
that
they
wear
wonderful
robes
and
*NL*
crowns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
robes
and
crowns
are
gone
out
of
fashion
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
,
*NL*
``
like
your
tomahawks
and
revolvers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
for
that
;
I
think
an
aristocracy
ought
to
be
splendid
,
''
*NL*
Henrietta
declared
.
``
If
it
's
not
that
,
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
know
,
it
is
n't
much
,
at
the
best
,
''
her
neighbour
allowed
.
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
have
a
potato
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
much
for
these
European
potatoes
.
I
should
n't
know
you
*NL*
from
an
ordinary
American
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
talk
to
me
as
if
I
were
one
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
.
``
I
do
n't
see
how
*NL*
you
manage
to
get
on
without
potatoes
;
you
must
find
so
few
things
to
*NL*
eat
over
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
was
silent
a
little
;
there
was
a
chance
he
was
not
sincere
.
*NL*
``
I
've
had
hardly
any
appetite
since
I
've
been
here
,
''
she
went
on
at
*NL*
last
;
``
so
it
does
n't
much
matter
.
I
do
n't
approve
of
you
,
you
know
;
I
*NL*
feel
as
if
I
ought
to
tell
you
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
approve
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
do
n't
suppose
any
one
ever
said
such
a
thing
to
you
before
,
did
*NL*
they
?
I
do
n't
approve
of
lords
as
an
institution
.
I
think
the
world
has
*NL*
got
beyond
them
--
far
beyond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
so
do
I.
I
do
n't
approve
of
myself
in
the
least
.
Sometimes
it
comes
*NL*
over
me
--
how
I
should
object
to
myself
if
I
were
not
myself
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
know
?
But
that
's
rather
good
,
by
the
way
--
not
to
be
vainglorious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
give
it
up
then
?
''
Miss
Stackpole
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
up
--
a

?
''
asked
Lord
Warburton
,
meeting
her
harsh
inflexion
with
a
*NL*
very
mellow
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
up
being
a
lord
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
little
of
one
!
One
would
really
forget
all
about
it
if
you
*NL*
wretched
Americans
were
not
constantly
reminding
one
.
However
,
I
do
*NL*
think
of
giving
it
up

the
little
there
is
left
of
it

one
of
these

days

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
you
do
it

Henrietta
exclaimed
rather
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
invite
you
to
the
ceremony
;
we
'll
have
a
supper
and
a
dance

``
Well

said
Miss
Stackpole
,
``
I
like

see
all
sides

Henrietta
continued
.
``
But

``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
explain
about

young

Is
she

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
neither

*NL*

Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
see
one
takes
life
easily

on

said
Lord
Warburton
.
*NL*
``
And
then

Ah

we
can
be
dull

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

different

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
badge

*NL*
``
A
sign
of
rank

*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
's
glance
had
wandered
a
good
deal
,
but
at
this
it
met
the
*NL*
gaze
of
his
neighbour
.
``
Oh
yes
,
''
he
answered
in
a
moment
;
``
the
women
go
*NL*
in
for
those
things
.
The
silver
cross
is
worn
by
the
eldest
daughters
of
*NL*
Viscounts
.
''
Which
was
his
harmless
revenge
for
having
occasionally
had
*NL*
his
credulity
too
easily
engaged
in
America
.
After
luncheon
he
proposed
*NL*
to
Isabel
to
come
into
the
gallery
and
look
at
the
pictures
;
and
though
*NL*
she
knew
he
had
seen
the
pictures
twenty
times
she
complied
without
*NL*
criticising
this
pretext
.
Her
conscience
now
was
very
easy
;
ever
since
*NL*
she
sent
him
her
letter
she
had
felt
particularly
light
of
spirit
.
He
*NL*
walked
slowly
to
the
end
of
the
gallery
,
staring
at
its
contents
and
*NL*
saying
nothing
;
and
then
he
suddenly
broke
out
:
``
I
hoped
you
would
n't
*NL*
write
to
me
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
only
way
,
Lord
Warburton
,
''
said
the
girl
.
``
Do
try
and
*NL*
believe
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
believe
it
of
course
I
should
let
you
alone
.
But
we
ca
n't
*NL*
believe
by
willing
it
;
and
I
confess
I
do
n't
understand
.
I
could
*NL*
understand
your
disliking
me
;
that
I
could
understand
well
.
But
that
you
*NL*
should
admit
you
do
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
admitted
?
''
Isabel
interrupted
,
turning
slightly
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
think
me
a
good
fellow
;
is
n't
that
it
?
''
She
said
nothing
,
*NL*
and
he
went
on
:
``
You
do
n't
seem
to
have
any
reason
,
and
that
gives
me
a
*NL*
sense
of
injustice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
reason
,
Lord
Warburton
.
''
She
said
it
in
a
tone
that
made
his
*NL*
heart
contract
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
very
much
to
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
some
day
when
there
's
more
to
show
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
my
saying
that
in
the
mean
time
I
must
doubt
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
make
me
very
unhappy
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sorry
for
that
;
it
may
help
you
to
know
how
I
feel
.
Will
you
*NL*
kindly
answer
me
a
question
?
''
Isabel
made
no
audible
assent
,
but
he
*NL*
apparently
saw
in
her
eyes
something
that
gave
him
courage
to
go
on
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
prefer
some
one
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
question
I
'd
rather
not
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
do
then
!
''
her
suitor
murmured
with
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bitterness
touched
her
,
and
she
cried
out
:
``
You
're
mistaken
!
I
*NL*
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
on
a
bench
,
unceremoniously
,
doggedly
,
like
a
man
in
*NL*
trouble
;
leaning
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
staring
at
the
floor
.
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
even
be
glad
of
that
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
throwing
himself
back
*NL*
against
the
wall
;
``
for
that
would
be
an
excuse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
eyebrows
in
surprise
.
``
An
excuse
?
Must
I
excuse
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paid
,
however
,
no
answer
to
the
question
.
Another
idea
had
come
into
*NL*
his
head
.
``
Is
it
my
political
opinions
?
Do
you
think
I
go
too
far
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
object
to
your
political
opinions
,
because
I
do
n't
understand
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
care
what
I
think
!
''
he
cried
,
getting
up
.
``
It
's
all
the
same
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
walked
to
the
other
side
of
the
gallery
and
stood
there
showing
*NL*
him
her
charming
back
,
her
light
slim
figure
,
the
length
of
her
white
*NL*
neck
as
she
bent
her
head
,
and
the
density
of
her
dark
braids
.
She
*NL*
stopped
in
front
of
a
small
picture
as
if
for
the
purpose
of
examining
*NL*
it
;
and
there
was
something
so
young
and
free
in
her
movement
that
her
*NL*
very
pliancy
seemed
to
mock
at
him
.
Her
eyes
,
however
,
saw
nothing
;
they
*NL*
had
suddenly
been
suffused
with
tears
.
In
a
moment
he
followed
her
,
and
*NL*
by
this
time
she
had
brushed
her
tears
away
;
but
when
she
turned
round
*NL*
her
face
was
pale
and
the
expression
of
her
eyes
strange
.
``
That
reason
*NL*
that
I
would
n't
tell
you
--
I
'll
tell
it
you
after
all
.
It
's
that
I
ca
n't
*NL*
escape
my
fate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
fate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
try
to
escape
it
if
I
were
to
marry
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
.
Why
should
not
that
be
your
fate
as
well
as
*NL*
anything
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
's
not
,
''
said
Isabel
femininely
.
``
I
know
it
's
not
.
It
's
not
*NL*
my
fate
to
give
up
--
I
know
it
ca
n't
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Lord
Warburton
stared
,
an
interrogative
point
in
either
eye
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
call
marrying
me
giving
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
usual
sense
.
It
's
getting
--
getting
--
getting
a
great
deal
.
*NL*
But
it
's
giving
up
other
chances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Other
chances
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
chances
to
marry
,
''
said
Isabel
,
her
colour
quickly
coming
*NL*
back
to
her
.
And
then
she
stopped
,
looking
down
with
a
deep
frown
,
as
if
*NL*
it
were
hopeless
to
attempt
to
make
her
meaning
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
presumptuous
in
me
to
suggest
that
you
'll
gain
more
*NL*
than
you
'll
lose
,
''
her
companion
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
escape
unhappiness
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
In
marrying
you
I
shall
be
*NL*
trying
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
'd
try
to
,
but
you
certainly
would
:
that
I
must
*NL*
in
candour
admit
!
''
he
exclaimed
with
an
anxious
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
n't
--
I
ca
n't
!
''
cried
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
're
bent
on
being
miserable
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
make

me
so
.
Whatever
charms
a
life
of
misery
may
have
for
you

it
has
none
*NL*
for
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
bent
on
a
life
of
misery
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
I
've
always
been
*NL*
intensely
determined
to
be
happy

I
've
often
believed
I
should
be

*NL*
I
've
told
people
that
;
you
can
ask
them

But
it
comes
over
me
every
*NL*
now
and
then
that
I
can
never
be
happy
in
any
extraordinary
way
;
not
by
*NL*
turning
away
,
by
separating
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
separating
yourself
from
what
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
From
life

From
the
usual
chances

dangers

from
what
most
people
*NL*
know
and
suffer

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
broke
into
a
smile
that
almost
denoted
hope
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
my
dear
Miss
Archer
,
''
he
began
to
explain
with
the
most
considerate
*NL*
eagerness
,
``
I
do
n't
offer
you
any
exoneration
from
life
or
from
any
*NL*
chances
or
dangers
whatever
.
I
wish
I
could
;
depend
upon
it
I
would
!
For
*NL*
what
do
you
take
me
,
pray
?
Heaven
help
me
,
I
'm
not
the
Emperor
of
China
!
*NL*
All
I
offer
you
is
the
chance
of
taking
the
common
lot
in
a
comfortable
*NL*
sort
of
way
.
The
common
lot
?
Why
,
I
'm
devoted
to
the
common
lot
!
Strike
*NL*
an
alliance
with
me
,
and
I
promise
you
that
you
shall
have
plenty
of
it
.
*NL*
You
shall
separate
from
nothing
whatever
--
not
even
from
your
friend
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'd
never
approve
of
it
,
''
said
Isabel
,
trying
to
smile
and
take
*NL*
advantage
of
this
side-issue
;
despising
herself
too
,
not
a
little
,
for
*NL*
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
speaking
of
Miss
Stackpole
?
''
his
lordship
asked
impatiently
.
``
I
*NL*
never
saw
a
person
judge
things
on
such
theoretic
grounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
suppose
you
're
speaking
of
me
,
''
said
Isabel
with
humility
;
and
*NL*
she
turned
away
again
,
for
she
saw
Miss
Molyneux
enter
the
gallery
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
Henrietta
and
by
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
's
sister
addressed
him
with
a
certain
timidity
and
*NL*
reminded
him
she
ought
to
return
home
in
time
for
tea
,
as
she
was
*NL*
expecting
company
to
partake
of
it
.
He
made
no
answer
--
apparently
*NL*
not
having
heard
her
;
he
was
preoccupied
,
and
with
good
reason
.
Miss
*NL*
Molyneux
--
as
if
he
had
been
Royalty
--
stood
like
a
lady-in-waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
never
,
Miss
Molyneux
!

said
Henrietta
Stackpole
.
``
If
I
wanted
*NL*
to
go
he

have
to
go

If
I
wanted
my

thing
he
'd
have
to
*NL*
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Warburton
does
everything
one
wants

Miss
Molyneux
answered
with
*NL*
a
quick
,
shy
laugh
.
``
How
very
many
pictures
you
have
!
''
she
went
on
,
*NL*
turning
to
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
look
a
good
many
,
because
they
're
all
put
together

''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
``
But
it
's
really
a
bad
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
think
it
's
so
nice

I
wish
we
had
a
gallery
at
Lockleigh

so
*NL*
very
fond
of
pictures

Miss
Molyneux
went
on
,
persistently
,
to
Ralph
,
*NL*
as
if
she
were
afraid
Miss
Stackpole
would
address
her
again
.
Henrietta
*NL*
appeared
at
once
to
fascinate
and
to
frighten
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
pictures
are
very
convenient
,
''
said
Ralph
,
who
appeared
to
know
*NL*
better
what
style
of
reflexion
was
acceptable
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
so
very
pleasant
when
it
rains

''
the
young
lady
continued
.
``
It
*NL*
has
rained
of
late
so
very
often

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry

're
going
away

Lord
Warburton

said
Henrietta
.
``
I
wanted
*NL*
to
get
a
great
deal
more
out
of
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
going
away

Lord
Warburton
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

says
you
must

In
America
the
gentlemen
obey
the
ladies

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
we
have
some
people
to
tea

said
Miss
Molyneux
,
looking
at
*NL*
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
my
dear

We
'll
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hoped
you
would
resist

Henrietta
exclaimed
.
``
I
wanted
to
see
what
*NL*
Miss
Molyneux
would
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
do
anything
,
''
said
this
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
in
your
position
it
's
sufficient
for
you
to
exist

Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
returned
.
``
I
should
like
very
much
to
see
you
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
come
to
Lockleigh
again
,
''
said
Miss
Molyneux
,
very
sweetly
,
to
*NL*
Isabel
,
ignoring
this
remark
of
Isabel
's
friend
.
Isabel
looked
into
her
*NL*
quiet
eyes
a
moment
,
and
for
that
moment
seemed
to
see
in
their
grey
*NL*
depths
the
reflexion
of
everything
she
had
rejected
in
rejecting
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
--
the
peace
,
the
kindness
,
the
honour
,
the
possessions
,
a
deep
*NL*
security
and
a
great
exclusion
.
She
kissed
Miss
Molyneux
and
then
she
*NL*
said
:
``
I
'm
afraid
I
can
never
come
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
going
away

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
very
sorry

''
said
Miss
Molyneux
.
``
I
think
that
's
so
very
*NL*
wrong
of
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
watched
this
little
passage
;
then
he
turned
away
and
*NL*
stared
at
a
picture
.
Ralph
,
leaning
against
the
rail
before
the
picture
*NL*
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
had
for
the
moment
been
watching
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
you
at
home
,
''
said
Henrietta
,
whom
Lord
Warburton
*NL*
found
beside
him
.
``
I
should
like
an
hour
's
talk
with
you
;
there
are
a
*NL*
great
many
questions
I
wish
to
ask
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
delighted
to
see
you
,
''
the
proprietor
of
Lockleigh
answered
;
*NL*
``
but
I
'm
certain
not
to
be
able
to
answer
many
of
your
questions
.
When
*NL*
will
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
Miss
Archer
will
take
me
.
We
're
thinking
of
going
to
London
,
*NL*
but
we
'll
go
and
see
you
first
.
I
'm
determined
to
get
some
satisfaction
*NL*
out
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
depends
upon
Miss
Archer
I
'm
afraid
you
wo
n't
get
much
.
She
wo
n't
*NL*
come
to
Lockleigh
;
she
does
n't
like
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
told
me
it
was
lovely
!
''
said
Henrietta
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
hesitated
.
``
She
wo
n't
come
,
all
the
same
.
You
had
better
*NL*
come
alone
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
straightened
herself
,
and
her
large
eyes
expanded
.
``
Would
you
*NL*
make
that
remark
to
an
English
lady
?
''
she
enquired
with
soft
asperity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
stared
.
``
Yes
,
if
I
liked
her
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
be
careful
not
to
like
her
enough
.
If
Miss
Archer
wo
n't
visit
*NL*
your
place
again
it
's
because
she
does
n't
want
to
take
me
.
I
know
what
*NL*
she
thinks
of
me
,
and
I
suppose
you
think
the
same
--
that
I
ought
n't
to
*NL*
bring
in
individuals
.
''
Lord
Warburton
was
at
a
loss
;
he
had
not
been
*NL*
made
acquainted
with
Miss
Stackpole
's
professional
character
and
failed
*NL*
to
catch
her
allusion
.
``
Miss
Archer
has
been
warning
you
!
''
she
therefore
*NL*
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Warning
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
that
why
she
came
off
alone
with
you
here
--
to
put
you
on
your
*NL*
guard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
no
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
brazenly
;
``
our
talk
had
no
such
*NL*
solemn
character
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
've
been
on
your
guard
--
intensely
.
I
suppose
it
's
natural
*NL*
to
you
;
that
's
just
what
I
wanted
to
observe
.
And
so
,
too
,
Miss
*NL*
Molyneux
--
she
would
n't
commit
herself
.
You
have
been
warned
,
anyway
,
''
*NL*
Henrietta
continued
,
addressing
this
young
lady
;
``
but
for
you
it
was
n't
*NL*
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
,
''
said
Miss
Molyneux
vaguely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Stackpole
takes
notes
,
''
Ralph
soothingly
explained
.
``
She
's
a
great
*NL*
satirist
;
she
sees
through
us
all
and
she
works
us
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
say
I
never
have
had
such
a
collection
of
bad
material
!
''
*NL*
Henrietta
declared
,
looking
from
Isabel
to
Lord
Warburton
and
from
this
*NL*
nobleman
to
his
sister
and
to
Ralph
.
``
There
's
something
the
matter
with
*NL*
you
all
;
you
're
as
dismal
as
if
you
had
got
a
bad
cable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
see
through
us
,
Miss
Stackpole
,
''
said
Ralph
in
a
low
tone
,
*NL*
giving
her
a
little
intelligent
nod
as
he
led
the
party
out
of
the
*NL*
gallery
.
``
There
's
something
the
matter
with
us
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
came
behind
these
two
;
Miss
Molyneux
,
who
decidedly
liked
her
*NL*
immensely
,
had
taken
her
arm
,
to
walk
beside
her
over
the
polished
*NL*
floor
.
Lord
Warburton
strolled
on
the
other
side
with
his
hands
behind
*NL*
him
and
his
eyes
lowered
.
For
some
moments
he
said
nothing
;
and
then
,
*NL*
``
Is
it
true
you
're
going
to
London
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
has
been
arranged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
shall
you
come
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
few
days
;
but
probably
for
a
very
short
time
.
I
'm
going
to
Paris
*NL*
with
my
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
,
then
,
shall
I
see
you
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
a
good
while
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
But
some
day
or
other
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
hope
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
a
few
steps
in
silence
;
then
he
stopped
and
put
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Molyneux
kissed
her
again
,
and
she
let
the
two
depart
.
After
it
,
*NL*
without
rejoining
Henrietta
and
Ralph
,
she
retreated
to
her
own
room
;
in
*NL*
which
apartment
,
before
dinner
,
she
was
found
by
Mrs.
Touchett
,
who
had
*NL*
stopped
on
her
way
to
the
salon
.
``
I
may
as
well
tell
you
,
''
said
that
*NL*
lady
,
``
that
your
uncle
has
informed
me
of
your
relations
with
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
considered
.
``
Relations
?
They
're
hardly
relations
.
That
's
the
*NL*
strange
part
of
it
:
he
has
seen
me
but
three
or
four
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
tell
your
uncle
rather
than
me
?
''
Mrs.
Touchett
*NL*
dispassionately
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
girl
hesitated
.
``
Because
he
knows
Lord
Warburton
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
know
you
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
of
that
,
''
said
Isabel
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
am
I
,
after
all
;
especially
when
you
give
me
that
rather
*NL*
conceited
look
.
One
would
think
you
were
awfully
pleased
with
yourself
*NL*
and
had
carried
off
a
prize
!
I
suppose
that
when
you
refuse
an
offer
*NL*
like
Lord
Warburton
's
it
's
because
you
expect
to
do
something
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
uncle
did
n't
say
that
!
''
cried
Isabel
,
smiling
still
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
arranged
that
the
two
young
ladies
should
proceed
to
London
*NL*
under
Ralph
's
escort
,
though
Mrs.
Touchett
looked
with
little
favour
on
*NL*
the
plan
.
It
was
just
the
sort
of
plan
,
she
said
,
that
Miss
Stackpole
*NL*
would
be
sure
to
suggest
,
and
she
enquired
if
the
correspondent
of
*NL*
the
Interviewer
was
to
take
the
party
to
stay
at
her
favourite
*NL*
boarding-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
where
she
takes
us
to
stay
,
so
long
as
there
's
local
*NL*
colour
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
That
's
what
we
're
going
to
London
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
after
a
girl
has
refused
an
English
lord
she
may
do
*NL*
anything
,
''
her
aunt
rejoined
.
``
After
that
one
need
n't
stand
on
trifles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
have
liked
me
to
marry
Lord
Warburton
?
''
Isabel
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
should
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
disliked
the
English
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
do
;
but
it
's
all
the
greater
reason
for
making
use
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
your
idea
of
marriage
?
''
And
Isabel
ventured
to
add
that
her
*NL*
aunt
appeared
to
her
to
have
made
very
little
use
of
Mr.
Touchett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
uncle
's
not
an
English
nobleman
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
,
``
though
even
*NL*
if
he
had
been
I
should
still
probably
have
taken
up
my
residence
in
*NL*
Florence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
Lord
Warburton
could
make
me
any
better
than
I
am
?
''
the
*NL*
girl
asked
with
some
animation
.
``
I
do
n't
mean
I
'm
too
good
to
improve
.
I
*NL*
mean
that
I
do
n't
love
Lord
Warburton
enough
to
marry
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
right
to
refuse
him
then
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
in
her
smallest
,
*NL*
sparest
voice
.
``
Only
,
the
next
great
offer
you
get
,
I
hope
you
'll
manage
*NL*
to
come
up
to
your
standard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
better
wait
till
the
offer
comes
before
we
talk
about
it
.
I
*NL*
hope
very
much
I
may
have
no
more
offers
for
the
present
.
They
upset
me
*NL*
completely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
probably
wo
n't
be
troubled
with
them
if
you
adopt
permanently
the
*NL*
Bohemian
manner
of
life
.
However
,
I
've
promised
Ralph
not
to
criticise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
do
whatever
Ralph
says
is
right
,
''
Isabel
returned
.
``
I
've
unbounded
*NL*
confidence
in
Ralph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
mother
's
much
obliged
to
you
!
''
this
lady
dryly
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
indeed
she
ought
to
feel
it
!
''
Isabel
irrepressibly
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
had
assured
her
that
there
would
be
no
violation
of
decency
in
*NL*
their
paying
a
visit
--
the
little
party
of
three
--
to
the
sights
of
the
*NL*
metropolis
;
but
Mrs.
Touchett
took
a
different
view
.
Like
many
ladies
of
*NL*
her
country
who
had
lived
a
long
time
in
Europe
,
she
had
completely
*NL*
lost
her
native
tact
on
such
points
,
and
in
her
reaction
,
not
in
itself
*NL*
deplorable
,
against
the
liberty
allowed
to
young
persons
beyond
the
*NL*
seas
,
had
fallen
into
gratuitous
and
exaggerated
scruples
.
Ralph
*NL*
accompanied
their
visitors
to
town
and
established
them
at
a
quiet
inn
*NL*
in
a
street
that
ran
at
right
angles
to
Piccadilly
.
His
first
idea
had
*NL*
been
to
take
them
to
his
father
's
house
in
Winchester
Square
,
a
large
,
*NL*
dull
mansion
which
at
this
period
of
the
year
was
shrouded
in
silence
*NL*
and
brown
holland
;
but
he
bethought
himself
that
,
the
cook
being
at
*NL*
Gardencourt
,
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
to
get
them
their
meals
,
*NL*
and
Pratt
's
Hotel
accordingly
became
their
resting-place
.
Ralph
,
on
his
*NL*
side
,
found
quarters
in
Winchester
Square
,
having
a
``
den
''
there
of
which
*NL*
he
was
very
fond
and
being
familiar
with
deeper
fears
than
that
of
a
*NL*
cold
kitchen
.
He
availed
himself
largely
indeed
of
the
resources
of
*NL*
Pratt
's
Hotel
,
beginning
his
day
with
an
early
visit
to
his
fellow
*NL*
travellers
,
who
had
Mr.
Pratt
in
person
,
in
a
large
bulging
white
*NL*
waistcoat
,
to
remove
their
dish-covers
.
Ralph
turned
up
,
as
he
said
,
*NL*
after
breakfast
,
and
the
little
party
made
out
a
scheme
of
entertainment
*NL*
for
the
day
.
As
London
wears
in
the
month
of
September
a
face
blank
but
*NL*
for
its
smears
of
prior
service
,
the
young
man
,
who
occasionally
took
*NL*
an
apologetic
tone
,
was
obliged
to
remind
his
companion
,
to
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
's
high
derision
,
that
there
was
n't
a
creature
in
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
mean
the
aristocracy
are
absent
,
''
Henrietta
answered
;
*NL*
``
but
I
do
n't
think
you
could
have
a
better
proof
that
if
they
were
*NL*
absent
altogether
they
would
n't
be
missed
.
It
seems
to
me
the
place
is
*NL*
about
as
full
as
it
can
be
.
There
's
no
one
here
,
of
course
,
but
three
*NL*
or
four
millions
of
people
.
What
is
it
you
call
them
--
the
lower-middle
*NL*
class
?
They
're
only
the
population
of
London
,
and
that
's
of
no
*NL*
consequence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
declared
that
for
him
the
aristocracy
left
no
void
that
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
herself
did
n't
fill
,
and
that
a
more
contented
man
was
nowhere
*NL*
at
that
moment
to
be
found
.
In
this
he
spoke
the
truth
,
for
the
stale
*NL*
September
days
,
in
the
huge
half-empty
town
,
had
a
charm
wrapped
in
them
*NL*
as
a
coloured
gem
might
be
wrapped
in
a
dusty
cloth
.
When
he
went
home
*NL*
at
night
to
the
empty
house
in
Winchester
Square
,
after
a
chain
of
hours
*NL*
with
his
comparatively
ardent
friends
,
he
wandered
into
the
big
dusky
*NL*
dining-room
,
where
the
candle
he
took
from
the
hall-table
,
after
letting
*NL*
himself
in
,
constituted
the
only
illumination
.
The
square
was
still
,
the
*NL*
house
was
still
;
when
he
raised
one
of
the
windows
of
the
dining-room
to
*NL*
let
in
the
air
he
heard
the
slow
creak
of
the
boots
of
a
lone
constable
.
*NL*
His
own
step
,
in
the
empty
place
,
seemed
loud
and
sonorous
;
some
of
the
*NL*
carpets
had
been
raised
,
and
whenever
he
moved
he
roused
a
melancholy
*NL*
echo
.
He
sat
down
in
one
of
the
armchairs
;
the
big
dark
dining
table
*NL*
twinkled
here
and
there
in
the
small
candle-light
;
the
pictures
on
the
*NL*
wall
,
all
of
them
very
brown
,
looked
vague
and
incoherent
.
There
was
a
*NL*
ghostly
presence
as
of
dinners
long
since
digested
,
of
table-talk
*NL*
that
had
lost
its
actuality
.
This
hint
of
the
supernatural
perhaps
had
*NL*
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
his
imagination
took
a
flight
and
*NL*
that
he
remained
in
his
chair
a
long
time
beyond
the
hour
at
which
he
*NL*
should
have
been
in
bed
;
doing
nothing
,
not
even
reading
the
evening
*NL*
paper
.
I
say
he
did
nothing
,
and
I
maintain
the
phrase
in
the
face
of
*NL*
the
fact
that
he
thought
at
these
moments
of
Isabel
.
To
think
of
Isabel
*NL*
could
only
be
for
him
an
idle
pursuit
,
leading
to
nothing
and
profiting
*NL*
little
to
any
one
.
His
cousin
had
not
yet
seemed
to
him
so
charming
*NL*
as
during
these
days
spent
in
sounding
,
tourist-fashion
,
the
deeps
*NL*
and
shallows
of
the
metropolitan
element
.
Isabel
was
full
of
premises
,
*NL*
conclusions
,
emotions
;
if
she
had
come
in
search
of
local
colour
she
*NL*
found
it
everywhere
.
She
asked
more
questions
than
he
could
answer
,
and
*NL*
launched
brave
theories
,
as
to
historic
cause
and
social
effect
,
that
he
*NL*
was
equally
unable
to
accept
or
to
refute
.
The
party
went
more
than
once
*NL*
to
the
British
Museum
and
to
that
brighter
palace
of
art
which
reclaims
*NL*
for
antique
variety
so
large
an
area
of
a
monotonous
suburb
;
they
spent
*NL*
a
morning
in
the
Abbey
and
went
on
a
penny-steamer
to
the
Tower
;
they
*NL*
looked
at
pictures
both
in
public
and
private
collections
and
sat
*NL*
on
various
occasions
beneath
the
great
trees
in
Kensington
Gardens
.
*NL*
Henrietta
proved
an
indestructible
sight-seer
and
a
more
lenient
judge
*NL*
than
Ralph
had
ventured
to
hope
.
She
had
indeed
many
disappointments
,
*NL*
and
London
at
large
suffered
from
her
vivid
remembrance
of
the
strong
*NL*
points
of
the
American
civic
idea
;
but
she
made
the
best
of
its
dingy
*NL*
dignities
and
only
heaved
an
occasional
sigh
and
uttered
a
desultory
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
which
led
no
further
and
lost
itself
in
retrospect
.
The
truth
*NL*
was
that
,
as
she
said
herself
,
she
was
not
in
her
element
.
``
I
've
not
a
*NL*
sympathy
with
inanimate
objects
,
''
she
remarked
to
Isabel
at
the
National
*NL*
Gallery
;
and
she
continued
to
suffer
from
the
meagreness
of
the
glimpse
*NL*
that
had
as
yet
been
vouchsafed
to
her
of
the
inner
life
.
Landscapes
*NL*
by
Turner
and
Assyrian
bulls
were
a
poor
substitute
for
the
literary
*NL*
dinner-parties
at
which
she
had
hoped
to
meet
the
genius
and
renown
of
*NL*
Great
Britain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
your
public
men
,
where
are
your
men
and
women
of
intellect
?
''
*NL*
she
enquired
of
Ralph
,
standing
in
the
middle
of
Trafalgar
Square
as
*NL*
if
she
had
supposed
this
to
be
a
place
where
she
would
naturally
meet
a
*NL*
few
.
``
That
's
one
of
them
on
the
top
of
the
column
,
you
say
--
Lord
Nelson
.
*NL*
Was
he
a
lord
too
?
Was
n't
he
high
enough
,
that
they
had
to
stick
him
a
*NL*
hundred
feet
in
the
air
?
That
's
the
past
--
I
do
n't
care
about
the
past
;
I
*NL*
want
to
see
some
of
the
leading
minds
of
the
present
.
I
wo
n't
say
of
the
*NL*
future
,
because
I
do
n't
believe
much
in
your
future
.
''
Poor
Ralph
had
few
*NL*
leading
minds
among
his
acquaintance
and
rarely
enjoyed
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
buttonholing
a
celebrity
;
a
state
of
things
which
appeared
to
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
to
indicate
a
deplorable
want
of
enterprise
.
``
If
I
were
on
the
*NL*
other
side
I
should
call
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
tell
the
gentleman
,
whoever
*NL*
he
might
be
,
that
I
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
him
and
had
come
to
see
*NL*
for
myself
.
But
I
gather
from
what
you
say
that
this
is
not
the
custom
*NL*
here
.
You
seem
to
have
plenty
of
meaningless
customs
,
but
none
of
those
*NL*
that
would
help
along
.
We
are
in
advance
,
certainly
.
I
suppose
I
shall
*NL*
have
to
give
up
the
social
side
altogether
;
''
and
Henrietta
,
though
*NL*
she
went
about
with
her
guidebook
and
pencil
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
*NL*
Interviewer
about
the
Tower
-LRB-
in
which
she
described
the
execution
of
*NL*
Lady
Jane
Grey
-RRB-
,
had
a
sad
sense
of
falling
below
her
mission
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
incident
that
had
preceded
Isabel
's
departure
from
Gardencourt
left
*NL*
a
painful
trace
in
our
young
woman
's
mind
:
when
she
felt
again
in
her
*NL*
face
,
as
from
a
recurrent
wave
,
the
cold
breath
of
her
last
suitor
's
*NL*
surprise
,
she
could
only
muffle
her
head
till
the
air
cleared
.
She
could
*NL*
not
have
done
less
than
what
she
did
;
this
was
certainly
true
.
But
her
*NL*
necessity
,
all
the
same
,
had
been
as
graceless
as
some
physical
act
in
*NL*
a
strained
attitude
,
and
she
felt
no
desire
to
take
credit
for
her
*NL*
conduct
.
Mixed
with
this
imperfect
pride
,
nevertheless
,
was
a
feeling
of
*NL*
freedom
which
in
itself
was
sweet
and
which
,
as
she
wandered
through
the
*NL*
great
city
with
her
ill-matched
companions
,
occasionally
throbbed
into
*NL*
odd
demonstrations
.
When
she
walked
in
Kensington
Gardens
she
stopped
*NL*
the
children
-LRB-
mainly
of
the
poorer
sort
-RRB-
whom
she
saw
playing
on
the
*NL*
grass
;
she
asked
them
their
names
and
gave
them
sixpence
and
,
when
*NL*
they
were
pretty
,
kissed
them
.
Ralph
noticed
these
quaint
charities
;
*NL*
he
noticed
everything
she
did
.
One
afternoon
,
that
his
companions
might
*NL*
pass
the
time
,
he
invited
them
to
tea
in
Winchester
Square
,
and
he
had
*NL*
the
house
set
in
order
as
much
as
possible
for
their
visit
.
There
*NL*
was
another
guest
to
meet
them
,
an
amiable
bachelor
,
an
old
friend
of
*NL*
Ralph
's
who
happened
to
be
in
town
and
for
whom
prompt
commerce
with
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
appeared
to
have
neither
difficulty
nor
dread
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bantling
,
a
stout
,
sleek
,
smiling
man
of
forty
,
wonderfully
dressed
,
*NL*
universally
informed
and
incoherently
amused
,
laughed
immoderately
at
*NL*
everything
Henrietta
said
,
gave
her
several
cups
of
tea
,
examined
in
her
*NL*
society
the
bric-a-brac
,
of
which
Ralph
had
a
considerable
collection
,
*NL*
and
afterwards
,
when
the
host
proposed
they
should
go
out
into
the
*NL*
square
and
pretend
it
was
a
fete-champetre
,
walked
round
the
limited
*NL*
enclosure
several
times
with
her
and
,
at
a
dozen
turns
of
their
talk
,
*NL*
bounded
responsive
--
as
with
a
positive
passion
for
argument
--
to
her
*NL*
remarks
upon
the
inner
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
see
;
I
dare
say
you
found
it
very
quiet
at
Gardencourt
.
Naturally
*NL*
there
's
not
much
going
on
there
when
there
's
such
a
lot
of
illness
*NL*
about
.
Touchett
's
very
bad
,
you
know
;
the
doctors
have
forbidden
his
*NL*
being
in
England
at
all
,
and
he
has
only
come
back
to
take
care
of
his
*NL*
father
.
The
old
man
,
I
believe
,
has
half
a
dozen
things
the
matter
*NL*
with
him
.
They
call
it
gout
,
but
to
my
certain
knowledge
he
has
organic
*NL*
disease
so
developed
that
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
'll
go
,
some
day
*NL*
soon
,
quite
quickly
.
Of
course
that
sort
of
thing
makes
a
dreadfully
*NL*
dull
house
;
I
wonder
they
have
people
when
they
can
do
so
little
for
*NL*
them
.
Then
I
believe
Mr.
Touchett
's
always
squabbling
with
his
wife
;
she
*NL*
lives
away
from
her
husband
,
you
know
,
in
that
extraordinary
American
*NL*
way
of
yours
.
If
you
want
a
house
where
there
's
always
something
going
*NL*
on
,
I
recommend
you
to
go
down
and
stay
with
my
sister
,
Lady
Pensil
,
*NL*
in
Bedfordshire
.
I
'll
write
to
her
to-morrow
and
I
'm
sure
she
'll
be
*NL*
delighted
to
ask
you
.
I
know
just
what
you
want
--
you
want
a
house
*NL*
where
they
go
in
for
theatricals
and
picnics
and
that
sort
of
thing
.
My
*NL*
sister
's
just
that
sort
of
woman
;
she
's
always
getting
up
something
or
*NL*
other
and
she
's
always
glad
to
have
the
sort
of
people
who
help
her
.
I
'm
*NL*
sure
she
'll
ask
you
down
by
return
of
post
:
she
's
tremendously
fond
of
*NL*
distinguished
people
and
writers
.
She
writes
herself
,
you
know
;
but
*NL*
I
have
n't
read
everything
she
has
written
.
It
's
usually
poetry
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
go
in
much
for
poetry
--
unless
it
's
Byron
.
I
suppose
you
think
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
Byron
in
America
,
''
Mr.
Bantling
continued
,
expanding
*NL*
in
the
stimulating
air
of
Miss
Stackpole
's
attention
,
bringing
up
his
*NL*
sequences
promptly
and
changing
his
topic
with
an
easy
turn
of
hand
.
*NL*
Yet
he
none
the
less
gracefully
kept
in
sight
of
the
idea
,
dazzling
to
*NL*
Henrietta
,
of
her
going
to
stay
with
Lady
Pensil
in
Bedfordshire
.
``
I
*NL*
understand
what
you
want
;
you
want
to
see
some
genuine
English
sport
.
*NL*
The
Touchetts
are
n't
English
at
all
,
you
know
;
they
have
their
own
*NL*
habits
,
their
own
language
,
their
own
food
--
some
odd
religion
even
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
of
their
own
.
The
old
man
thinks
it
's
wicked
to
hunt
,
I
'm
told
.
*NL*
You
must
get
down
to
my
sister
's
in
time
for
the
theatricals
,
and
I
'm
*NL*
sure
she
'll
be
glad
to
give
you
a
part
.
I
'm
sure
you
act
well
;
I
know
*NL*
you
're
very
clever
.
My
sister
's
forty
years
old
and
has
seven
children
,
*NL*
but
she
's
going
to
play
the
principal
part
.
Plain
as
she
is
she
makes
up
*NL*
awfully
well
--
I
will
say
for
her
.
Of
course
you
need
n't
act
if
you
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
Mr.
Bantling
delivered
himself
while
they
strolled
over
*NL*
the
grass
in
Winchester
Square
,
which
,
although
it
had
been
peppered
*NL*
by
the
London
soot
,
invited
the
tread
to
linger
.
Henrietta
thought
her
*NL*
blooming
,
easy-voiced
bachelor
,
with
his
impressibility
to
feminine
*NL*
merit
and
his
splendid
range
of
suggestion
,
a
very
agreeable
man
,
and
*NL*
she
valued
the
opportunity
he
offered
her
.
``
I
do
n't
know
but
I
would
go
,
*NL*
if
your
sister
should
ask
me
.
I
think
it
would
be
my
duty
.
What
do
you
*NL*
call
her
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pensil
.
It
's
an
odd
name
,
but
it
is
n't
a
bad
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
one
name
's
as
good
as
another
.
But
what
's
her
rank
?
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
's
a
baron
's
wife
;
a
convenient
sort
of
rank
.
You
're
fine
enough
*NL*
and
you
're
not
too
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
but
what
she
'd
be
too
fine
for
me
.
What
do
you
call
the
*NL*
place
she
lives
in
--
Bedfordshire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
lives
away
in
the
northern
corner
of
it
.
It
's
a
tiresome
country
,
*NL*
but
I
dare
say
you
wo
n't
mind
it
.
I
'll
try
and
run
down
while
you
're
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
very
pleasant
to
Miss
Stackpole
,
and
she
was
sorry
to
be
*NL*
obliged
to
separate
from
Lady
Pensil
's
obliging
brother
.
But
it
happened
*NL*
that
she
had
met
the
day
before
,
in
Piccadilly
,
some
friends
whom
she
*NL*
had
not
seen
for
a
year
:
the
Miss
Climbers
,
two
ladies
from
Wilmington
,
*NL*
Delaware
,
who
had
been
travelling
on
the
Continent
and
were
now
*NL*
preparing
to
re-embark
.
Henrietta
had
had
a
long
interview
with
them
on
*NL*
the
Piccadilly
pavement
,
and
though
the
three
ladies
all
talked
at
once
*NL*
they
had
not
exhausted
their
store
.
It
had
been
agreed
therefore
that
*NL*
Henrietta
should
come
and
dine
with
them
in
their
lodgings
in
Jermyn
*NL*
Street
at
six
o'clock
on
the
morrow
,
and
she
now
bethought
herself
of
*NL*
this
engagement
.
She
prepared
to
start
for
Jermyn
Street
,
taking
leave
*NL*
first
of
Ralph
Touchett
and
Isabel
,
who
,
seated
on
garden
chairs
*NL*
in
another
part
of
the
enclosure
,
were
occupied
--
if
the
term
may
be
*NL*
used
--
with
an
exchange
of
amenities
less
pointed
than
the
practical
*NL*
colloquy
of
Miss
Stackpole
and
Mr.
Bantling
.
When
it
had
been
settled
*NL*
between
Isabel
and
her
friend
that
they
should
be
reunited
at
some
*NL*
reputable
hour
at
Pratt
's
Hotel
,
Ralph
remarked
that
the
latter
must
*NL*
have
a
cab
.
She
could
n't
walk
all
the
way
to
Jermyn
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
mean
it
's
improper
for
me
to
walk
alone
!
''
Henrietta
*NL*
exclaimed
.
``
Merciful
powers
,
have
I
come
to
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
not
the
slightest
need
of
your
walking
alone
,
''
Mr.
Bantling
*NL*
gaily
interposed
.
``
I
should
be
greatly
pleased
to
go
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
simply
meant
that
you
'd
be
late
for
dinner
,
''
Ralph
returned
.
``
Those
*NL*
poor
ladies
may
easily
believe
that
we
refuse
,
at
the
last
,
to
spare
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
have
a
hansom
,
Henrietta
,

said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
get
you
a
hansom
if
you
'll
trust
me
,
''
Mr.
Bantling
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
might
walk
a
little
till
we
meet
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
n't
trust
him
,
do
you
?
''
Henrietta
enquired
of
*NL*
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
what
Mr.
Bantling
could
do
to
you
,
''
Isabel
obligingly
*NL*
answered
;
``
but
,
if
you
like
,
we
'll
walk
with
you
till
you
find
your
*NL*
cab
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
;
we
'll
go
alone
.
Come
on
,
Mr.
Bantling
,
and
take
care
you
*NL*
get
me
a
good
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bantling
promised
to
do
his
best
,
and
the
two
took
their
departure
,
*NL*
leaving
the
girl
and
her
cousin
together
in
the
square
,
over
which
*NL*
a
clear
September
twilight
had
now
begun
to
gather
.
It
was
perfectly
*NL*
still
;
the
wide
quadrangle
of
dusky
houses
showed
lights
in
none
of
the
*NL*
windows
,
where
the
shutters
and
blinds
were
closed
;
the
pavements
were
*NL*
a
vacant
expanse
,
and
,
putting
aside
two
small
children
from
a
*NL*
neighbouring
slum
,
who
,
attracted
by
symptoms
of
abnormal
animation
*NL*
in
the
interior
,
poked
their
faces
between
the
rusty
rails
of
*NL*
the
enclosure
,
the
most
vivid
object
within
sight
was
the
big
red
*NL*
pillar-post
on
the
southeast
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henrietta
will
ask
him
to
get
into
the
cab
and
go
with
her
to
Jermyn
*NL*
Street
,
''
Ralph
observed
.
He
always
spoke
of
Miss
Stackpole
as
Henrietta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
possibly
,
''
said
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
rather
,
no
,
she
wo
n't
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
But
Bantling
will
ask
leave
to
*NL*
get
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
again
.
I
'm
glad
very
they
're
such
good
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
made
a
conquest
.
He
thinks
her
a
brilliant
woman
.
It
may
go
*NL*
far
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
briefly
silent
.
``
I
call
Henrietta
a
very
brilliant
woman
,
but
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
it
will
go
far
.
They
would
never
really
know
each
other
.
*NL*
He
has
not
the
least
idea
what
she
really
is
,
and
she
has
no
just
*NL*
comprehension
of
Mr.
Bantling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
more
usual
basis
of
union
than
a
mutual
misunderstanding
.
*NL*
But
it
ought
not
to
be
so
difficult
to
understand
Bob
Bantling
,
''
Ralph
*NL*
added
.
``
He
is
a
very
simple
organism
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
Henrietta
's
a
simpler
one
still
.
And
,
pray
,
what
am
I
to
do
?
''
*NL*
Isabel
asked
,
looking
about
her
through
the
fading
light
,
in
which
the
*NL*
limited
landscape-gardening
of
the
square
took
on
a
large
and
effective
*NL*
appearance
.
``
I
do
n't
imagine
that
you
'll
propose
that
you
and
I
,
for
our
*NL*
amusement
,
shall
drive
about
London
in
a
hansom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
reason
we
should
n't
stay
here
--
if
you
do
n't
dislike
it
.
It
's
*NL*
very
warm
;
there
will
be
half
an
hour
yet
before
dark
;
and
if
you
permit
*NL*
it
I
'll
light
a
cigarette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
do
what
you
please
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
if
you
'll
amuse
me
till
*NL*
seven
o'clock
.
I
propose
at
that
hour
to
go
back
and
partake
of
a
simple
*NL*
and
solitary
repast
--
two
poached
eggs
and
a
muffin
--
at
Pratt
's
Hotel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
n't
I
dine
with
you
?
''
Ralph
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
'll
dine
at
your
club
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
wandered
back
to
their
chairs
in
the
centre
of
the
square
*NL*
again
,
and
Ralph
had
lighted
his
cigarette
.
It
would
have
given
him
*NL*
extreme
pleasure
to
be
present
in
person
at
the
modest
little
feast
she
*NL*
had
sketched
;
but
in
default
of
this
he
liked
even
being
forbidden
.
For
*NL*
the
moment
,
however
,
he
liked
immensely
being
alone
with
her
,
in
the
*NL*
thickening
dusk
,
in
the
centre
of
the
multitudinous
town
;
it
made
her
*NL*
seem
to
depend
upon
him
and
to
be
in
his
power
.
This
power
he
could
*NL*
exert
but
vaguely
;
the
best
exercise
of
it
was
to
accept
her
decisions
*NL*
submissively
which
indeed
there
was
already
an
emotion
in
doing
.
``
Why
*NL*
wo
n't
you
let
me
dine
with
you
?
''
he
demanded
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
n't
care
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
're
tired
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
an
hour
hence
.
You
see
I
have
the
gift
of
foreknowledge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
shall
be
delightful
meanwhile
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
said
nothing
more
,
and
as
she
made
no
rejoinder
they
sat
*NL*
some
time
in
a
stillness
which
seemed
to
contradict
his
promise
of
*NL*
entertainment
.
It
seemed
to
him
she
was
preoccupied
,
and
he
wondered
*NL*
what
she
was
thinking
about
;
there
were
two
or
three
very
possible
*NL*
subjects
.
At
last
he
spoke
again
.
``
Is
your
objection
to
my
society
this
*NL*
evening
caused
by
your
expectation
of
another
visitor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
head
with
a
glance
of
her
clear
,
fair
eyes
.
``
Another
*NL*
visitor
?
What
visitor
should
I
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
none
to
suggest
;
which
made
his
question
seem
to
himself
silly
as
*NL*
well
as
brutal
.
``
You
've
a
great
many
friends
that
I
do
n't
know
.
You
've
a
*NL*
whole
past
from
which
I
was
perversely
excluded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
reserved
for
my
future
.
You
must
remember
that
my
past
is
over
*NL*
there
across
the
water
.
There
's
none
of
it
here
in
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
then
,
since
your
future
is
seated
beside
you
.
Capital
thing
*NL*
to
have
your
future
so
handy
.
''
And
Ralph
lighted
another
cigarette
and
*NL*
reflected
that
Isabel
probably
meant
she
had
received
news
that
Mr.
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
had
crossed
to
Paris
.
After
he
had
lighted
his
cigarette
*NL*
he
puffed
it
a
while
,
and
then
he
resumed
.
``
I
promised
just
now
to
be
*NL*
very
amusing
;
but
you
see
I
do
n't
come
up
to
the
mark
,
and
the
fact
is
*NL*
there
's
a
good
deal
of
temerity
in
one
's
undertaking
to
amuse
a
*NL*
person
like
you
.
What
do
you
care
for
my
feeble
attempts
?
You
've
grand
*NL*
ideas
--
you
've
a
high
standard
in
such
matters
.
I
ought
at
least
to
bring
*NL*
in
a
band
of
music
or
a
company
of
mountebanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
mountebank
's
enough
,
and
you
do
very
well
.
Pray
go
on
,
and
in
*NL*
another
ten
minutes
I
shall
begin
to
laugh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
I
'm
very
serious
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
You
do
really
ask
a
great
*NL*
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
.
I
ask
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
accept
nothing
,
''
said
Ralph
.
She
coloured
,
and
now
suddenly
it
*NL*
seemed
to
her
that
she
guessed
his
meaning
.
But
why
should
he
speak
*NL*
to
her
of
such
things
?
He
hesitated
a
little
and
then
he
continued
:
*NL*
``
There
's
something
I
should
like
very
much
to
say
to
you
.
It
's
a
*NL*
question
I
wish
to
ask
.
It
seems
to
me
I
've
a
right
to
ask
it
,
because
*NL*
I
've
a
kind
of
interest
in
the
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
what
you
will
,
''
Isabel
replied
gently
,
``
and
I
'll
try
to
satisfy
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
I
hope
you
wo
n't
mind
my
saying
that
Warburton
has
told
me
*NL*
of
something
that
has
passed
between
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
suppressed
a
start
;
she
sat
looking
at
her
open
fan
.
``
Very
good
;
*NL*
I
suppose
it
was
natural
he
should
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
his
leave
to
let
you
know
he
has
done
so
.
He
has
some
hope
*NL*
still
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
it
a
few
days
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
he
has
any
now
,
''
said
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
sorry
for
him
then
;
he
's
such
an
honest
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
did
he
ask
you
to
talk
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
that
.
But
he
told
me
because
he
could
n't
help
it
.
We
're
old
*NL*
friends
,
and
he
was
greatly
disappointed
.
He
sent
me
a
line
asking
me
*NL*
to
come
and
see
him
,
and
I
drove
over
to
Lockleigh
the
day
before
he
and
*NL*
his
sister
lunched
with
us
.
He
was
very
heavy-hearted
;
he
had
just
got
a
*NL*
letter
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
show
you
the
letter
?
''
asked
Isabel
with
momentary
loftiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
.
But
he
told
me
it
was
a
neat
refusal
.
I
was
very
sorry
for
*NL*
him
,
''
Ralph
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
moments
Isabel
said
nothing
;
then
at
last
,
``
Do
you
know
how
*NL*
often
he
had
seen
me
?
''
she
enquired
.
``
Five
or
six
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
to
your
glory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
for
that
I
say
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
do
you
say
it
for
.
Not
to
prove
that
poor
Warburton
's
state
*NL*
of
mind
's
superficial
,
because
I
'm
pretty
sure
you
do
n't
think
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
certainly
was
unable
to
say
she
thought
it
;
but
presently
she
*NL*
said
something
else
.
``
If
you
've
not
been
requested
by
Lord
Warburton
to
*NL*
argue
with
me
,
then
you
're
doing
it
disinterestedly
--
or
for
the
love
of
*NL*
argument
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
wish
to
argue
with
you
at
all
.
I
only
wish
to
leave
you
alone

*NL*
I
'm
simply
greatly
interested
in
your
own
sentiments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
greatly
obliged
to
you
!
''
cried
Isabel
with
a
slightly
nervous
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
mean
that
I
'm
meddling
in
what
does
n't
concern
me
.
But
*NL*
why
should
n't
I
speak
to
you
of
this
matter
without
annoying
you
or
*NL*
embarrassing
myself
?
What
's
the
use
of
being
your
cousin
if
I
ca
n't
have
*NL*
a
few
privileges
?
What
's
the
use
of
adoring
you
without
hope
of
a
reward

if
I
ca

have
a
few
compensations

What
's
the
use

being
ill

disabled

restricted
to
mere
spectatorship
at
the
game
of
life

really
ca
n't
see
the
show
when
I
've
paid
so
much
for
my
ticket

Tell
me
*NL*
this

Ralph
went
on
while
she
listened
to
him
with
quickened
attention
.
*NL*
``
What
had
you
in
mind

you
refused
Lord

*NL*
``

``
No

not
logic

really
nothing

know

What
was
it
you
said
to
yourself
?
You
certainly
said
more
than
*NL*
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
reflected
a
moment
,
then
answered
with
a
question
of
her
own
.
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
call
it
a
remarkable
act

That
's
what
your
mother
thinks

too

*NL*
*NL*
``
Warburton
's
such
a
thorough
good
sort

as
a
man

I
consider
he
has
*NL*
hardly
a
fault

And
then
he
's
what
they
call
here
no
end
of
a
swell
.
He
*NL*
has
immense
possessions
,
and
his
wife
would
be
thought
a
superior
being
.
*NL*
He
unites
the
intrinsic
and
the
extrinsic
advantages

''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
watched
her
cousin
as
to
see
how
far
he
would
go
.
``
I
refused
him
*NL*
because
he
was
too
perfect
then

I
'm
not
perfect
myself

he
's
too
*NL*
good
for
me

Besides

his
perfection
would
irritate
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
ingenious
rather
than
candid

said
Ralph
.

As
a
fact

nothing

perfect

Do

good

``
No

you
're
exacting

all
the

yourself
good

Nineteen
women
out
of
twenty
,
however

even
of
the
most
*NL*
exacting
sort

would
have
managed
to
do
with

stalked

*NL*
``
I
do

it
seems
to
me

Isabel
,
``
that
one
day
*NL*

talked

mentioned
odd
things

Ralph
smokingly
*NL*
considered
.
``
I
hope
that
what
I
said
then
had
no
weight
with
you

for
they
were
not
faults

things
I
spoke

simply

peculiarities

his
position

If
I
had
known

wished
to
marry
you
I
'd
*NL*
never
have
alluded
to
them

I
think
I
said
that
as

that
position
*NL*
he
was
rather
a
sceptic

would
have
been
in
your
power

believer

*NL*
*NL*
``

not

do

evidently
disappointed

Isabel
added

looking
at
her
cousin
with
rueful
gentleness

She
gave
rather
a
conscious
sigh

as
interesting
to
*NL*
myself
as
I
am
to
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
're
not
candid
again
;
you
're
extremely
interesting
to
*NL*
yourself
.
Do
you
know
,
however
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
that
if
you
've
really
*NL*
given
Warburton
his
final
answer
I
'm
rather
glad
it
has
been
what
it
*NL*
was
.
I
do
n't
mean
I
'm
glad
for
you
,
and
still
less
of
course
for
him
.
*NL*
I
'm
glad
for
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
thinking
of
proposing
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
.
From
the
point
of
view
I
speak
of
that
would
be
fatal
;
*NL*
I
should
kill
the
goose
that
supplies
me
with
the
material
of
my
*NL*
inimitable
omelettes
.
I
use
that
animal
as
the
symbol
of
my
insane
*NL*
illusions
.
What
I
mean
is
that
I
shall
have
the
thrill
of
seeing
what
a
*NL*
young
lady
does
who
wo
n't
marry
Lord
Warburton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
your
mother
counts
upon
too
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
will
be
plenty
of
spectators
!
We
shall
hang
on
the
rest
of
*NL*
your
career
.
I
shall
not
see
all
of
it
,
but
I
shall
probably
see
the
*NL*
most
interesting
years
.
Of
course
if
you
were
to
marry
our
friend
you
'd
*NL*
still
have
a
career
--
a
very
decent
,
in
fact
a
very
brilliant
one
.
But
*NL*
relatively
speaking
it
would
be
a
little
prosaic
.
It
would
be
definitely
*NL*
marked
out
in
advance
;
it
would
be
wanting
in
the
unexpected
.
You
know
*NL*
I
'm
extremely
fond
of
the
unexpected
,
and
now
that
you
've
kept
the
game
*NL*
in
your
hands
I
depend
on
your
giving
us
some
grand
example
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
very
well
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
but
I
do
so
well
*NL*
enough
to
be
able
to
say
that
if
you
look
for
grand
examples
of
anything
*NL*
from
me
I
shall
disappoint
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
do
so
only
by
disappointing
yourself
and
that
will
go
hard
with
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
she
made
no
direct
reply
;
there
was
an
amount
of
truth
in
it
*NL*
that
would
bear
consideration
.
At
last
she
said
abruptly
:
``
I
do
n't
see
*NL*
what
harm
there
is
in
my
wishing
not
to
tie
myself
.
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
begin
life
by
marrying
.
There
are
other
things
a
woman
can
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
she
can
do
so
well

But
you
're
of
course
so
*NL*
many-sided
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
one
's
two-sided
it
's
enough
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
the
most
charming
of
polygons
!
''
her
companion
broke
out
.
At
a
*NL*
glance
from
his
companion
,
however
,
he
became
grave
,
and
to
prove
it
*NL*
went
on
:
``
You
want
to
see
life
--
you
'll
be
hanged
if
you
do
n't
,
as
the
*NL*
young
men
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
want
to
see
it
as
the
young
men
want
to
see
it
.
But
I
*NL*
do
want
to
look
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
drain
the
cup
of
experience

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
touch
the
cup
of
experience

It
's
a
poisoned
drink
!
*NL*
I
only
want
to
see
for
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
see
,
but
not
to
feel

''
Ralph
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
that
if
one
's
a
sentient
being
one
can
make
the
*NL*
distinction
.
I
'm
a
good
deal
like
Henrietta
.
The
other
day
when
I
asked
*NL*
her
if
she
wished
to
marry
she
said
:
`
Not
till
I
've
seen
Europe

I
too
*NL*
do
n't
wish
to
marry
till
I
've
seen
Europe

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
evidently
expect
a
crowned
head
will
be
struck
with
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
would
be
worse
than
marrying
Lord
Warburton
.
But
it
's
getting
*NL*
very
dark
,
''
Isabel
continued
,
``
and
I
must
go
home
.
''
She
rose
from
her
*NL*
place
,
but
Ralph
only
sat
still
and
looked
at
her
.
As
he
remained
there
*NL*
she
stopped
,
and
they
exchanged
a
gaze
that
was
full
on
either
side
,
but
*NL*
especially
on
Ralph
's
,
of
utterances
too
vague
for
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
answered
my
question
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
You
've
told
me
what
I
*NL*
wanted
.
I
'm
greatly
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
I
've
told
you
very
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
told
me
the
great
thing
:
that
the
world
interests
you
and
that
*NL*
you
want
to
throw
yourself
into
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
silvery
eyes
shone
a
moment
in
the
dusk
.
``
I
never
said
that
.
''
``
I
*NL*
think
you
meant
it

Do
n't
repudiate
it

It
's
so
fine
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
're
trying
to
fasten
upon
me
,
for
I
'm
not
in
the
*NL*
least
an
adventurous
spirit
.
Women
are
not
like
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
slowly
rose
from
his
seat
and
they
walked
together
to
the
gate
of
*NL*
the
square
.
``
No
,
''
he
said
;
``
women
rarely
boast
of
their
courage
.
Men
do
*NL*
so
with
a
certain
frequency
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
have
it
to
boast
of
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Women
have
it
too

You
've
a
great
deal

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
to
go
home
in
a
cab
to
Pratt
's
Hotel

not
more

*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
unlocked
the
gate
,
and
after
they
had
passed
out
he
fastened
it
.
*NL*
``
We
'll
find
your
cab
,
''
he
said
;
and
as
they
turned
toward
a
neighbouring
*NL*
street
in
which
this
quest
might
avail
he
asked
her
again
if
he
might
n't
*NL*
see
her
safely
to
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
,
''
she
answered
;
``
you
're
very
tired
;
you
must
go
home
and
go
*NL*
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cab
was
found
,
and
he
helped
her
into
it
,
standing
a
moment
at
the
*NL*
door
.
``
When
people
forget
I
'm
a
poor
creature
I
'm
often
incommoded

said

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
had
no
hidden
motive
in
wishing
him
not
to
take
her
home
;
it
*NL*
simply
struck
her
that
for
some
days
past
she
had
consumed
an
inordinate
*NL*
quantity
of
his
time
,
and
the
independent
spirit
of
the
American
girl
*NL*
whom
extravagance
of
aid
places
in
an
attitude
that
she
ends
by
finding
*NL*
``
affected
''
had
made
her
decide
that
for
these
few
hours
she
must
suffice
*NL*
to
herself
.
She
had
moreover
a
great
fondness
for
intervals
of
solitude
,
*NL*
which
since
her
arrival
in
England
had
been
but
meagrely
met
.
It
was
a
*NL*
luxury
she
could
always
command
at
home
and
she
had
wittingly
missed
*NL*
it
.
That
evening
,
however
,
an
incident
occurred
which
--
had
there
been
a
*NL*
critic
to
note
it
--
would
have
taken
all
colour
from
the
theory
that
the
*NL*
wish
to
be
quite
by
herself
had
caused
her
to
dispense
with
her
cousin
's
*NL*
attendance
.
Seated
toward
nine
o'clock
in
the
dim
illumination
of
*NL*
Pratt
's
Hotel
and
trying
with
the
aid
of
two
tall
candles
to
lose
*NL*
herself
in
a
volume
she
had
brought
from
Gardencourt
,
she
succeeded
*NL*
only
to
the
extent
of
reading
other
words
than
those
printed
on
the
*NL*
page
--
words
that
Ralph
had
spoken
to
her
that
afternoon
.
Suddenly
*NL*
the
well-muffed
knuckle
of
the
waiter
was
applied
to
the
door
,
which
*NL*
presently
gave
way
to
his
exhibition
,
even
as
a
glorious
trophy
,
of
the
*NL*
card
of
a
visitor
.
When
this
memento
had
offered
to
her
fixed
sight
the
*NL*
name
of
Mr.
Caspar
Goodwood
she
let
the
man
stand
before
her
without
*NL*
signifying
her
wishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
show
the
gentleman
up
,
ma'am
?
''
he
asked
with
a
slightly
*NL*
encouraging
inflexion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
hesitated
still
and
while
she
hesitated
glanced
at
the
mirror
.
*NL*
``
He
may
come
in
,
''
she
said
at
last
;
and
waited
for
him
not
so
much
*NL*
smoothing
her
hair
as
girding
her
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
was
accordingly
the
next
moment
shaking
hands
with
her
,
*NL*
but
saying
nothing
till
the
servant
had
left
the
room
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
*NL*
answer
my
letter
?
''
he
then
asked
in
a
quick
,
full
,
slightly
peremptory
*NL*
tone
--
the
tone
of
a
man
whose
questions
were
habitually
pointed
and
who
*NL*
was
capable
of
much
insistence
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
by
a
ready
question
,
``
How
did
you
know
I
was
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Stackpole
let
me
know
,
''
said
Caspar
Goodwood
.
``
She
told
me
you
*NL*
would
probably
be
at
home
alone
this
evening
and
would
be
willing
to
see
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
she
see
you
--
to
tell
you
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
n't
see
me
;
she
wrote
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
silent
;
neither
had
sat
down
;
they
stood
there
with
an
air
*NL*
of
defiance
,
or
at
least
of
contention
.
``
Henrietta
never
told
me
she
was
*NL*
writing
to
you
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
``
This
is
not
kind
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
so
disagreeable
to
you
to
see
me
?
''
asked
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
expect
it
.
I
do
n't
like
such
surprises
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
knew
I
was
in
town
;
it
was
natural
we
should
meet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
this
meeting
?
I
hoped
I
should
n't
see
you
.
In
so
big
a
*NL*
place
as
London
it
seemed
very
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
apparently
repugnant
to
you
even
to
write
to
me
,
''
her
visitor
*NL*
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
made
no
reply
;
the
sense
of
Henrietta
Stackpole
's
treachery
,
*NL*
as
she
momentarily
qualified
it
,
was
strong
within
her
.
``
Henrietta
's
*NL*
certainly
not
a
model
of
all
the
delicacies
!
''
she
exclaimed
with
*NL*
bitterness
.
``
It
was
a
great
liberty
to
take
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
'm
not
a
model
either
--
of
those
virtues
or
of
any
others
.
*NL*
The
fault
's
mine
as
much
as
hers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Isabel
looked
at
him
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
jaw
had
never
been
*NL*
more
square
.
This
might
have
displeased
her
,
but
she
took
a
different
*NL*
turn
.
``
No
,
it
's
not
your
fault
so
much
as
hers
.
What
you
've
done
was
*NL*
inevitable
,
I
suppose
,
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
indeed
!
''
cried
Caspar
Goodwood
with
a
voluntary
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
that
I
've
come
,
at
any
rate
,
may
n't
I
stay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
sit
down
,
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
back
to
her
chair
again
,
while
her
visitor
took
the
first
place
*NL*
that
offered
,
in
the
manner
of
a
man
accustomed
to
pay
little
thought
to
*NL*
that
sort
of
furtherance
.
``
I
've
been
hoping
every
day
for
an
answer
to
*NL*
my
letter
.
You
might
have
written
me
a
few
lines
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
the
trouble
of
writing
that
prevented
me
;
I
could
as
easily
*NL*
have
written
you
four
pages
as
one
.
But
my
silence
was
an
intention
,
''
*NL*
Isabel
said
.
``
I
thought
it
the
best
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
hers
while
she
spoke
;
then
he
lowered
them
*NL*
and
attached
them
to
a
spot
in
the
carpet
as
if
he
were
making
a
strong
*NL*
effort
to
say
nothing
but
what
he
ought
.
He
was
a
strong
man
in
the
*NL*
wrong
,
and
he
was
acute
enough
to
see
that
an
uncompromising
exhibition
*NL*
of
his
strength
would
only
throw
the
falsity
of
his
position
into
*NL*
relief
.
Isabel
was
not
incapable
of
tasting
any
advantage
of
position
*NL*
over
a
person
of
this
quality
,
and
though
little
desirous
to
flaunt
it
*NL*
in
his
face
she
could
enjoy
being
able
to
say
``
You
know
you
ought
n't
to
*NL*
have
written
to
me
yourself
!
''
and
to
say
it
with
an
air
of
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
raised
his
eyes
to
her
own
again
;
they
seemed
to
shine
*NL*
through
the
vizard
of
a
helmet
.
He
had
a
strong
sense
of
justice
and
was
*NL*
ready
any
day
in
the
year
--
over
and
above
this
--
to
argue
the
question
*NL*
of
his
rights
.
``
You
said
you
hoped
never
to
hear
from
me
again
;
I
know
*NL*
that
.
But
I
never
accepted
any
such
rule
as
my
own
.
I
warned
you
that
*NL*
you
should
hear
very
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
say
I
hoped
NEVER
to
hear
from
you
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
five
years
then
;
for
ten
years
;
twenty
years
.
It
's
the
same
*NL*
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
find
it
so
?
It
seems
to
me
there
's
a
great
difference
.
I
can
*NL*
imagine
that
at
the
end
of
ten
years
we
might
have
a
very
pleasant
*NL*
correspondence

I
shall
have
matured
my
epistolary
style
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
away
while
she
spoke
these
words
,
knowing
them
of
so
much
*NL*
less
earnest
a
cast
than
the
countenance
of
her
listener
.
Her
eyes
,
*NL*
however
,
at
last
came
back
to
him
,
just
as
he
said
very
irrelevantly
;
*NL*
``
Are
you
enjoying
your
visit
to
your
uncle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
indeed
.
''
She
dropped
,
but
then
she
broke
out
.
``
What
good
do
*NL*
you
expect
to
get
by
insisting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
good
of
not
losing
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
no
right
to
talk
of
losing
what
's
not
yours
.
And
even
from
your
*NL*
own
point
of
view
,
''
Isabel
added
,
``
you
ought
to
know
when
to
let
one
*NL*
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
disgust
you
very
much
,
''
said
Caspar
Goodwood
gloomily
;
not
as
if
to
*NL*
provoke
her
to
compassion
for
a
man
conscious
of
this
blighting
fact
,
*NL*
but
as
if
to
set
it
well
before
himself
,
so
that
he
might
endeavour
to
*NL*
act
with
his
eyes
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
do
n't
at
all
delight
me
,
you
do
n't
fit
in
,
not
in
any
way
,
*NL*
just
now
,
and
the
worst
is
that
your
putting
it
to
the
proof
in
this
*NL*
manner
is
quite
unnecessary
.
''
It
was
n't
certainly
as
if
his
nature
had
*NL*
been
soft
,
so
that
pin-pricks
would
draw
blood
from
it
;
and
from
the
*NL*
first
of
her
acquaintance
with
him
,
and
of
her
having
to
defend
herself
*NL*
against
a
certain
air
that
he
had
of
knowing
better
what
was
good
for
*NL*
her
than
she
knew
herself
,
she
had
recognised
the
fact
that
perfect
*NL*
frankness
was
her
best
weapon
.
To
attempt
to
spare
his
sensibility
or
to
*NL*
escape
from
him
edgewise
,
as
one
might
do
from
a
man
who
had
barred
*NL*
the
way
less
sturdily
--
this
,
in
dealing
with
Caspar
Goodwood
,
who
would
*NL*
grasp
at
everything
of
every
sort
that
one
might
give
him
,
was
wasted
*NL*
agility
.
It
was
not
that
he
had
not
susceptibilities
,
but
his
passive
*NL*
surface
,
as
well
as
his
active
,
was
large
and
hard
,
and
he
might
always
*NL*
be
trusted
to
dress
his
wounds
,
so
far
as
they
required
it
,
himself
.
She
*NL*
came
back
,
even
for
her
measure
of
possible
pangs
and
aches
in
him
,
*NL*
to
her
old
sense
that
he
was
naturally
plated
and
steeled
,
armed
*NL*
essentially
for
aggression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
reconcile
myself
to
that
,
''
he
simply
said
.
There
was
a
*NL*
dangerous
liberality
about
it
;
for
she
felt
how
open
it
was
to
him
to
*NL*
make
the
point
that
he
had
not
always
disgusted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
reconcile
myself
to
it
either
,
and
it
's
not
the
state
of
things
*NL*
that
ought
to
exist
between
us
.
If
you
'd
only
try
to
banish
me
from
your
*NL*
mind
for
a
few
months
we
should
be
on
good
terms
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
If
I
should
cease
to
think
of
you
at
all
for
a
prescribed
time
,
*NL*
I
should
find
I
could
keep
it
up
indefinitely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indefinitely
is
more
than
I
ask
.
It
's
more
even
than
I
should
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
what
you
ask
is
impossible
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
taking
*NL*
his
adjective
for
granted
in
a
manner
she
found
irritating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
capable
of
making
a
calculated
effort
?
''
she
demanded
.
*NL*
``
You
're
strong
for
everything
else
;
why
should
n't
you
be
strong
for
*NL*
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
effort
calculated
for
what
?
''
And
then
as
she
hung
fire
,
``
I
'm
*NL*
capable
of
nothing
with
regard
to
you
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
but
just
of
being
*NL*
infernally
in
love
with
you
.
If
one
's
strong
one
loves
only
the
more
*NL*
strongly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
good
deal
in
that
;
''
and
indeed
our
young
lady
felt
the
*NL*
force
of
it
--
felt
it
thrown
off
,
into
the
vast
of
truth
and
poetry
,
*NL*
as
practically
a
bait
to
her
imagination
.
But
she
promptly
came
round
.
*NL*
``
Think
of
me
or
not
,
as
you
find
most
possible
;
only
leave
me
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Until
when
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
for
a
year
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
do
you
mean
?
Between
one
year
and
two
there
's
all
the
difference
*NL*
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
it
two
then
,
''
said
Isabel
with
a
studied
effect
of
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
shall
I
gain
by
that
?
''
her
friend
asked
with
no
sign
of
*NL*
wincing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
obliged
me
greatly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
will
be
my
reward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
need
a
reward
for
an
act
of
generosity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
when
it
involves
a
great
sacrifice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
generosity
without
some
sacrifice
.
Men
do
n't
understand
such
*NL*
things
.
If
you
make
the
sacrifice
you
'll
have
all
my
admiration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
a
cent
for
your
admiration
--
not
one
straw
,
with
nothing
to
*NL*
show
for
it
.
When
will
you
marry
me
?
That
's
the
only
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
--
if
you
go
on
making
me
feel
only
as
I
feel
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
gain
then
by
not
trying
to
make
you
feel
otherwise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
gain
quite
as
much
as
by
worrying
me
to
death
!
''
Caspar
Goodwood
*NL*
bent
his
eyes
again
and
gazed
a
while
into
the
crown
of
his
hat
.
A
*NL*
deep
flush
overspread
his
face
;
she
could
see
her
sharpness
had
at
last
*NL*
penetrated
.
This
immediately
had
a
value
--
classic
,
romantic
,
redeeming
,
*NL*
what
did
she
know
?
for
her
;
``
the
strong
man
in
pain
''
was
one
of
the
*NL*
categories
of
the
human
appeal
,
little
charm
as
he
might
exert
in
the
*NL*
given
case
.
``
Why
do
you
make
me
say
such
things
to
you
?
''
she
cried
in
a
*NL*
trembling
voice
.
``
I
only
want
to
be
gentle
--
to
be
thoroughly
kind
.
It
's
*NL*
not
delightful
to
me
to
feel
people
care
for
me
and
yet
to
have
to
try
*NL*
and
reason
them
out
of
it
.
I
think
others
also
ought
to
be
considerate
;
*NL*
we
have
each
to
judge
for
ourselves
.
I
know
you
're
considerate
,
as
much
*NL*
as
you
can
be
;
you
've
good
reasons
for
what
you
do
.
But
I
really
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
marry
,
or
to
talk
about
it
at
all
now
.
I
shall
probably
never
*NL*
do
it
--
no
,
never
.
I
've
a
perfect
right
to
feel
that
way
,
and
it
's
no
*NL*
kindness
to
a
woman
to
press
her
so
hard
,
to
urge
her
against
her
will
.
*NL*
If
I
give
you
pain
I
can
only
say
I
'm
very
sorry
.
It
's
not
my
fault
;
I
*NL*
ca
n't
marry
you
simply
to
please
you
.
I
wo
n't
say
that
I
shall
always
*NL*
remain
your
friend
,
because
when
women
say
that
,
in
these
situations
,
it
*NL*
passes
,
I
believe
,
for
a
sort
of
mockery
.
But
try
me
some
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
,
during
this
speech
,
had
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
*NL*
name
of
his
hatter
,
and
it
was
not
until
some
time
after
she
had
ceased
*NL*
speaking
that
he
raised
them
.
When
he
did
so
the
sight
of
a
rosy
,
lovely
*NL*
eagerness
in
Isabel
's
face
threw
some
confusion
into
his
attempt
to
*NL*
analyse
her
words
.
``
I
'll
go
home
--
I
'll
go
to-morrow
--
I
'll
leave
you
*NL*
alone
,
''
he
brought
out
at
last
.
``
Only
,
''
he
heavily
said
,
``
I
hate
to
lose
*NL*
sight
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
fear
.
I
shall
do
no
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
marry
some
one
else
,
as
sure
as
I
sit
here
,
''
Caspar
Goodwood
*NL*
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
that
a
generous
charge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
Plenty
of
men
will
try
to
make
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
just
now
that
I
do
n't
wish
to
marry

that
I
almost
*NL*
certainly
never
shall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
did
,
and
I
like
your
`
almost
certainly

!
I
put
no
faith
in
*NL*
what
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
very
much
.
Do
you
accuse
me
of
lying
to
shake
you
off
?
You
*NL*
say
very
delicate
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
not
say
that

You
've
given
me
no
pledge
of
anything
at

all

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

that
's
all
that
would
be
wanting

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
perhaps
even
believe
you
're
safe

from
wishing
to
be
.
But
*NL*
you
're
not

''
the
young
man
went
on
as
if
preparing
himself
for
the
*NL*
worst
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
then

We
'll
put
it
that

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

however

said
Caspar
Goodwood
,
``
that
my
keeping
you
in
*NL*
sight
would
prevent
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
indeed
?
I
'm
after
all
very
much
afraid
of
you

Do
you
think
*NL*
I
'm
so
very
easily
pleased
?

she
asked
suddenly
,
changing
her
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
do
n't
;
I
shall
try
to
console
myself
with
that

But
there
are
a
*NL*
certain
number
of
very
dazzling
men
in
the
world
,
no
doubt
;
and
if
there
*NL*
were
only
one
it
would
be
enough
.
The
most
dazzling
of
all
will
make
*NL*
straight
for
you
.
You
'll
be
sure
to
take
no
one
who
is
n't
dazzling

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
mean
by
dazzling
brilliantly
clever
,
''
Isabel
said
--
``
and
I
ca
n't
*NL*
imagine
what
else
you
mean

I
do
n't
need
the
aid
of
a
clever
man
to
*NL*
teach
me
how
to
live

I
can
find
it
out
for
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Find
out

*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
a
moment
;
then
with
a
quick
smile
,
``
Oh
,
you
ought
to
*NL*
marry
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
might
be
pardoned
if
for
an
instant
this
exclamation
seemed
to
him
*NL*
to
sound
the
infernal
note
,
and
it
is
not
on
record
that
her
motive
for
*NL*
discharging
such
a
shaft
had
been
of
the
clearest
.
He
ought
n't
to
stride
*NL*
about
lean
and
hungry
,
however
--
she
certainly
felt
THAT
for
him
.
``
God
*NL*
forgive
you
!
''
he
murmured
between
his
teeth
as
he
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
accent
had
put
her
slightly
in
the
wrong
,
and
after
a
moment
she
*NL*
felt
the
need
to
right
herself
.
The
easiest
way
to
do
it
was
to
place
*NL*
him
where
she
had
been
.
``
You
do
me
great
injustice
--
you
say
what
you
*NL*
do
n't
know
!
''
she
broke
out
.
``
I
should
n't
be
an
easy
victim
--
I
've
proved
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
to
me
,
perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
proved
it
to
others
as
well
.
''
And
she
paused
a
moment
.
``
I
refused
*NL*
a
proposal
of
marriage
last
week
;
what
they
call
--
no
doubt

a
dazzling
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
glad
to
hear
it

said
the
young
man
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
proposal
many
girls
would
have
accepted
;
it
had
everything
to

recommend
it

Isabel
had
not
proposed
to
herself
to
tell
this
story
,
*NL*
but
,
now
she
had
begun
,
the
satisfaction
of
speaking
it
out
and
doing
*NL*
herself
justice
took
possession
of
her
.
``
I
was
offered
a
great
position
*NL*
and
a
great
fortune

by
a
person
whom
I
like
extremely

*NL*
*NL*
Caspar
watched
her
with
intense
interest
.
``
Is
he
an
Englishman
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
an
English
nobleman

said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
visitor
received
this
announcement
at
first
in
silence
,
but
at
last
*NL*
said
:
``
I
'm
glad
he
's
disappointed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
as
you
have
companions
in
misfortune

make
the
best
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
call
him
a
companion

said
Casper
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
--
since
I
declined
his
offer
absolutely
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
does
n't
make
him
my
companion

Besides

he
's
an
Englishman

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
is
n't
an
Englishman
a
human
being

Isabel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

those
people
?
They
're
not
of
my
humanity

I
do

care
what

becomes
of
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
angry

said
the
girl
.
``
We
've
discussed
this
matter
quite
*NL*
enough

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes

that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
away
from
him
,
walked
to
the
open
window
and
stood
a
moment
*NL*
looking
into
the
dusky
void
of
the
street
,
where
a
turbid
gaslight
*NL*
alone
represented
social
animation
.
For
some
time
neither
of
these
young
*NL*
persons
spoke
;
Caspar
lingered
near
the
chimney-piece
with
eyes
gloomily
*NL*
attached
.
She
had
virtually
requested
him
to
go
--
he
knew
that
;
but
at
*NL*
the
risk
of
making
himself
odious
he
kept
his
ground
.
She
was
far
too
*NL*
dear
to
him
to
be
easily
renounced
,
and
he
had
crossed
the
sea
all
to
*NL*
wring
from
her
some
scrap
of
a
vow
.
Presently
she
left
the
window
and
*NL*
stood
again
before
him
.
``
You
do
me
very
little
justice
--
after
my
telling
*NL*
you
what
I
told
you
just
now
.
I
'm
sorry
I
told
you
--
since
it
matters
so
*NL*
little
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
cried
the
young
man
,
``
if
you
were
thinking
of
ME
when
you
did
it
!
''
*NL*
And
then
he
paused
with
the
fear
that
she
might
contradict
so
happy
a
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
of
you
a
little
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
?
I
do
n't
understand
.
If
the
knowledge
of
what
I
feel
for
you
*NL*
had
any
weight
with
you
at
all
,
calling
it
a
`
little
'
is
a
poor
account
*NL*
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
shook
her
head
as
if
to
carry
off
a
blunder
.
``
I
've
refused
a
most
*NL*
kind
,
noble
gentleman
.
Make
the
most
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
then
,
''
said
Caspar
Goodwood
gravely
.
``
I
thank
you
*NL*
immensely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
you
had
better
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
not
see
you
again
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
's
better
not
.
You
'll
be
sure
to
talk
of
this
,
and
you
see
it
*NL*
leads
to
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
you
not
to
say
a
word
that
will
annoy
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
reflected
and
then
answered
:
``
I
return
in
a
day
or
two
to
my
*NL*
uncle
's
,
and
I
ca
n't
propose
to
you
to
come
there
.
It
would
be
too
*NL*
inconsistent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
,
on
his
side
,
considered
.
``
You
must
do
me
justice
too
.
*NL*
I
received
an
invitation
to
your
uncle
's
more
than
a
week
ago
,
and
I
*NL*
declined
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
betrayed
surprise
.
``
From
whom
was
your
invitation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Mr.
Ralph
Touchett
,
whom
I
suppose
to
be
your
cousin
.
I
declined
*NL*
it
because
I
had
not
your
authorisation
to
accept
it
.
The
suggestion
*NL*
that
Mr.
Touchett
should
invite
me
appeared
to
have
come
from
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
certainly
never
did
from
me
.
Henrietta
really
goes
very
far
,
''
Isabel
*NL*
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
too
hard
on
her
--
that
touches
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
if
you
declined
you
did
quite
right
,
and
I
thank
you
for
it
.
''
And
*NL*
she
gave
a
little
shudder
of
dismay
at
the
thought
that
Lord
Warburton
*NL*
and
Mr.
Goodwood
might
have
met
at
Gardencourt
:
it
would
have
been
so
*NL*
awkward
for
Lord
Warburton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
leave
your
uncle
where
do
you
go
?
''
her
companion
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
go
abroad
with
my
aunt
--
to
Florence
and
other
places
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
serenity
of
this
announcement
struck
a
chill
to
the
young
man
's
*NL*
heart
;
he
seemed
to
see
her
whirled
away
into
circles
from
which
he
was
*NL*
inexorably
excluded
.
Nevertheless
he
went
on
quickly
with
his
questions
.
*NL*
``
And
when
shall
you
come
back
to
America
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
for
a
long
time
.
I
'm
very
happy
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
give
up
your
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
an
infant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'll
be
out
of
my
sight
indeed
!
''
said
Caspar
Goodwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
answered
rather
grandly
.
``
The
world
--
with
all
these
*NL*
places
so
arranged
and
so
touching
each
other
--
comes
to
strike
one
as
*NL*
rather
small
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
sight
too
big
for
ME
!
''
Caspar
exclaimed
with
a
simplicity
*NL*
our
young
lady
might
have
found
touching
if
her
face
had
not
been
set
*NL*
against
concessions
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
attitude
was
part
of
a
system
,
a
theory
,
that
she
had
lately
*NL*
embraced
,
and
to
be
thorough
she
said
after
a
moment
:
``
Do
n't
think
me
*NL*
unkind
if
I
say
it
's
just
THAT
--
being
out
of
your
sight
--
that
I
like
.
*NL*
If
you
were
in
the
same
place
I
should
feel
you
were
watching
me
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
that
--
I
like
my
liberty
too
much
.
If
there
's
a
thing
in
the
*NL*
world
I
'm
fond
of
,
''
she
went
on
with
a
slight
recurrence
of
grandeur
,
*NL*
``
it
's
my
personal
independence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
whatever
there
might
be
of
the
too
superior
in
this
speech
moved
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
's
admiration
;
there
was
nothing
he
winced
at
in
the
*NL*
large
air
of
it
.
He
had
never
supposed
she
had
n't
wings
and
the
need
of
*NL*
beautiful
free
movements
--
he
was
n't
,
with
his
own
long
arms
and
strides
,
*NL*
afraid
of
any
force
in
her
.
Isabel
's
words
,
if
they
had
been
meant
to
*NL*
shock
him
,
failed
of
the
mark
and
only
made
him
smile
with
the
sense
*NL*
that
here
was
common
ground
.
``
Who
would
wish
less
to
curtail
your
*NL*
liberty
than
I
?
What
can
give
me
greater
pleasure
than
to
see
you
*NL*
perfectly
independent
--
doing
whatever
you
like
?
It
's
to
make
you
*NL*
independent
that
I
want
to
marry
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
beautiful
sophism
,
''
said
the
girl
with
a
smile
more
beautiful
*NL*
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
unmarried
woman
--
a
girl
of
your
age
--
is
n't
independent
.
There
are
*NL*
all
sorts
of
things
she
ca
n't
do
.
She
's
hampered
at
every
step
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
as
she
looks
at
the
question
,
''
Isabel
answered
with
much
spirit
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
in
my
first
youth
--
I
can
do
what
I
choose
--
I
belong
quite
to
*NL*
the
independent
class
.
I
've
neither
father
nor
mother
;
I
'm
poor
and
of
*NL*
a
serious
disposition
;
I
'm
not
pretty
.
I
therefore
am
not
bound
to
be
*NL*
timid
and
conventional
;
indeed
I
ca
n't
afford
such
luxuries
.
Besides
,
*NL*
I
try
to
judge
things
for
myself
;
to
judge
wrong
,
I
think
,
is
more
*NL*
honourable
than
not
to
judge
at
all
.
I
do
n't
wish
to
be
a
mere
sheep
in
*NL*
the
flock
;
I
wish
to
choose
my
fate
and
know
something
of
human
affairs
*NL*
beyond
what
other
people
think
it
compatible
with
propriety
to
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
She
paused
a
moment
,
but
not
long
enough
for
her
companion
to
reply
.
He
*NL*
was
apparently
on
the
point
of
doing
so
when
she
went
on
:
``
Let
me
say
*NL*
this
to
you
,
Mr.
Goodwood
.
You
're
so
kind
as
to
speak
of
being
afraid
of
*NL*
my
marrying
.
If
you
should
hear
a
rumour
that
I
'm
on
the
point
of
doing
*NL*
so
--
girls
are
liable
to
have
such
things
said
about
them
--
remember
what
*NL*
I
have
told
you
about
my
love
of
liberty
and
venture
to
doubt
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
passionately
positive
in
the
tone
in
which
she
gave
*NL*
him
this
advice
,
and
he
saw
a
shining
candour
in
her
eyes
that
helped
*NL*
him
to
believe
her
.
On
the
whole
he
felt
reassured
,
and
you
might
have
*NL*
perceived
it
by
the
manner
in
which
he
said
,
quite
eagerly
:
``
You
want
*NL*
simply
to
travel
for
two
years
?
I
'm
quite
willing
to
wait
two
years
,
and
*NL*
you
may
do
what
you
like
in
the
interval
.
If
that
's
all
you
want
,
*NL*
pray
say
so
.
I
do
n't
want
you
to
be
conventional
;
do
I
strike
you
as
*NL*
conventional
myself
?
Do
you
want
to
improve
your
mind
?
Your
mind
's
quite
*NL*
good
enough
for
me
;
but
if
it
interests
you
to
wander
about
a
while
and
*NL*
see
different
countries
I
shall
be
delighted
to
help
you
in
any
way
in
*NL*
my
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
generous
;
that
's
nothing
new
to
me
.
The
best
way
to
help
me
*NL*
will
be
to
put
as
many
hundred
miles
of
sea
between
us
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
would
think
you
were
going
to
commit
some
atrocity
!
''
said
Caspar
*NL*
Goodwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
am
.
I
wish
to
be
free
even
to
do
that
if
the
fancy
takes
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
he
said
slowly
,
``
I
'll
go
home
.
''
And
he
put
out
his
hand
,
*NL*
trying
to
look
contented
and
confident
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
's
confidence
in
him
,
however
,
was
greater
than
any
he
could
feel
*NL*
in
her
.
Not
that
he
thought
her
capable
of
committing
an
atrocity
;
but
,
*NL*
turn
it
over
as
he
would
,
there
was
something
ominous
in
the
way
she
*NL*
reserved
her
option
.
As
she
took
his
hand
she
felt
a
great
respect
for
*NL*
him
;
she
knew
how
much
he
cared
for
her
and
she
thought
him
magnanimous
.
*NL*
They
stood
so
for
a
moment
,
looking
at
each
other
,
united
by
a
*NL*
hand-clasp
which
was
not
merely
passive
on
her
side
.
``
That
's
right
,
''
*NL*
she
said
very
kindly
,
almost
tenderly
.
``
You
'll
lose
nothing
by
being
a
*NL*
reasonable
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'll
come
back
,
wherever
you
are
,
two
years
hence
,
''
he
returned
*NL*
with
characteristic
grimness
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
seen
that
our
young
lady
was
inconsequent
,
and
at
this
she
*NL*
suddenly
changed
her
note
.
``
Ah
,
remember
,
I
promise
nothing
--
absolutely
*NL*
nothing
!
''
Then
more
softly
,
as
if
to
help
him
to
leave
her
:
``
And
*NL*
remember
too
that
I
shall
not
be
an
easy
victim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
get
very
sick
of
your
independence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
shall
;
it
's
even
very
probable
.
When
that
day
comes
I
shall
*NL*
be
very
glad
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
laid
her
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
that
led
into
her
room
,
*NL*
and
she
waited
a
moment
to
see
whether
her
visitor
would
not
take
his
*NL*
departure
.
But
he
appeared
unable
to
move
;
there
was
still
an
immense
*NL*
unwillingness
in
his
attitude
and
a
sore
remonstrance
in
his
eyes
.
``
I
*NL*
must
leave
you
now
,
''
said
Isabel
;
and
she
opened
the
door
and
passed
*NL*
into
the
other
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
apartment
was
dark
,
but
the
darkness
was
tempered
by
a
vague
*NL*
radiance
sent
up
through
the
window
from
the
court
of
the
hotel
,
and
*NL*
Isabel
could
make
out
the
masses
of
the
furniture
,
the
dim
shining
of
*NL*
the
mirror
and
the
looming
of
the
big
four-posted
bed
.
She
stood
still
a
*NL*
moment
,
listening
,
and
at
last
she
heard
Caspar
Goodwood
walk
out
of
*NL*
the
sitting-room
and
close
the
door
behind
him
.
She
stood
still
a
little
*NL*
longer
,
and
then
,
by
an
irresistible
impulse
,
dropped
on
her
knees
*NL*
before
her
bed
and
hid
her
face
in
her
arms
.

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
praying
;
she
was
trembling
--
trembling
all
over
.
Vibration
*NL*
was
easy
to
her
,
was
in
fact
too
constant
with
her
,
and
she
found
*NL*
herself
now
humming
like
a
smitten
harp
.
She
only
asked
,
however
,
to
put
*NL*
on
the
cover
,
to
case
herself
again
in
brown
holland
,
but
she
wished
to
*NL*
resist
her
excitement
,
and
the
attitude
of
devotion
,
which
she
kept
for
*NL*
some
time
,
seemed
to
help
her
to
be
still
.
She
intensely
rejoiced
that
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
was
gone
;
there
was
something
in
having
thus
got
rid
of
*NL*
him
that
was
like
the
payment
,
for
a
stamped
receipt
,
of
some
debt
*NL*
too
long
on
her
mind
.
As
she
felt
the
glad
relief
she
bowed
her
head
a
*NL*
little
lower
;
the
sense
was
there
,
throbbing
in
her
heart
;
it
was
part
*NL*
of
her
emotion
,
but
it
was
a
thing
to
be
ashamed
of
--
it
was
profane
and
*NL*
out
of
place
.
It
was
not
for
some
ten
minutes
that
she
rose
from
her
*NL*
knees
,
and
even
when
she
came
back
to
the
sitting-room
her
tremor
had
*NL*
not
quite
subsided
.
It
had
had
,
verily
,
two
causes
:
part
of
it
was
to
be
*NL*
accounted
for
by
her
long
discussion
with
Mr.
Goodwood
,
but
it
might
be
*NL*
feared
that
the
rest
was
simply
the
enjoyment
she
found
in
the
exercise
*NL*
of
her
power
.
She
sat
down
in
the
same
chair
again
and
took
up
her
book
,
*NL*
but
without
going
through
the
form
of
opening
the
volume
.
She
leaned
*NL*
back
,
with
that
low
,
soft
,
aspiring
murmur
with
which
she
often
*NL*
uttered
her
response
to
accidents
of
which
the
brighter
side
was
not
*NL*
superficially
obvious
,
and
yielded
to
the
satisfaction
of
having
refused
*NL*
two
ardent
suitors
in
a
fortnight
.
That
love
of
liberty
of
which
she
*NL*
had
given
Caspar
Goodwood
so
bold
a
sketch
was
as
yet
almost
exclusively
*NL*
theoretic
;
she
had
not
been
able
to
indulge
it
on
a
large
scale
.
But
it
*NL*
appeared
to
her
she
had
done
something
;
she
had
tasted
of
the
delight
,
*NL*
if
not
of
battle
,
at
least
of
victory
;
she
had
done
what
was
truest
to
*NL*
her
plan
.
In
the
glow
of
this
consciousness
the
image
of
Mr.
Goodwood
*NL*
taking
his
sad
walk
homeward
through
the
dingy
town
presented
itself
*NL*
with
a
certain
reproachful
force
;
so
that
,
as
at
the
same
moment
the
*NL*
door
of
the
room
was
opened
,
she
rose
with
an
apprehension
that
he
*NL*
had
come
back
.
But
it
was
only
Henrietta
Stackpole
returning
from
her
*NL*
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
immediately
saw
that
our
young
lady
had
been
``
through
''
*NL*
something
,
and
indeed
the
discovery
demanded
no
great
penetration
.
She
*NL*
went
straight
up
to
her
friend
,
who
received
her
without
a
greeting
.
*NL*
Isabel
's
elation
in
having
sent
Caspar
Goodwood
back
to
America
*NL*
presupposed
her
being
in
a
manner
glad
he
had
come
to
see
her
;
but
at
*NL*
the
same
time
she
perfectly
remembered
Henrietta
had
had
no
right
to
set
*NL*
a
trap
for
her
.
``
Has
he
been
here
,
dear
?
''
the
latter
yearningly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
turned
away
and
for
some
moments
answered
nothing
.
``
You
acted
*NL*
very
wrongly
,
''
she
declared
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
acted
for
the
best
.
I
only
hope
you
acted
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
the
judge
.
I
ca
n't
trust
you
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
declaration
was
unflattering
,
but
Henrietta
was
much
too
unselfish
*NL*
to
heed
the
charge
it
conveyed
;
she
cared
only
for
what
it
intimated
*NL*
with
regard
to
her
friend
.
``
Isabel
Archer
,
''
she
observed
with
equal
*NL*
abruptness
and
solemnity
,
``
if
you
marry
one
of
these
people
I
'll
never
*NL*
speak
to
you
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
making
so
terrible
a
threat
you
had
better
wait
till
I
'm
asked
,
''
*NL*
Isabel
replied
.
Never
having
said
a
word
to
Miss
Stackpole
about
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
's
overtures
,
she
had
now
no
impulse
whatever
to
justify
*NL*
herself
to
Henrietta
by
telling
her
that
she
had
refused
that
nobleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
'll
be
asked
quick
enough
,
once
you
get
off
on
the
Continent
.
*NL*
Annie
Climber
was
asked
three
times
in
Italy
--
poor
plain
little
Annie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
Annie
Climber
was
n't
captured
why
should
I
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
Annie
was
pressed
;
but
you
'll
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
flattering
conviction
,
''
said
Isabel
without
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
flatter
you
,
Isabel
,
I
tell
you
the
truth
!
''
cried
her
friend
.
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
do
n't
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
did
n't
give
Mr.
Goodwood
some
*NL*
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
tell
you
anything
;
as
I
said
to
you
just
now
,
*NL*
I
ca
n't
trust
you
.
But
since
you
're
so
much
interested
in
Mr.
Goodwood
I
*NL*
wo
n't
conceal
from
you
that
he
returns
immediately
to
America
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
've
sent
him
off
?
''
Henrietta
almost
shrieked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
him
to
leave
me
alone
;
and
I
ask
you
the
same
,
Henrietta
.
''
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
glittered
for
an
instant
with
dismay
,
and
then
passed
to
the
*NL*
mirror
over
the
chimney-piece
and
took
off
her
bonnet
.
``
I
hope
you
've
*NL*
enjoyed
your
dinner
,
''
Isabel
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
her
companion
was
not
to
be
diverted
by
frivolous
propositions
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
know
where
you
're
going
,
Isabel
Archer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
I
'm
going
to
bed
,
''
said
Isabel
with
persistent
frivolity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
where
you
're
drifting
?
''
Henrietta
pursued
,
holding
out
her
*NL*
bonnet
delicately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
,
and
I
find
it
very
pleasant
not
to
know
.
*NL*
A
swift
carriage
,
of
a
dark
night
,
rattling
with
four
horses
over
roads
*NL*
that
one
ca
n't
see
--
that
's
my
idea
of
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Goodwood
certainly
did
n't
teach
you
to
say
such
things
as
*NL*
that
--
like
the
heroine
of
an
immoral
novel
,
''
said
Miss
Stackpole
.
*NL*
``
You
're
drifting
to
some
great
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
irritated
by
her
friend
's
interference
,
yet
she
still
tried
*NL*
to
think
what
truth
this
declaration
could
represent
.
She
could
think
*NL*
of
nothing
that
diverted
her
from
saying
:
``
You
must
be
very
fond
of
me
,
*NL*
Henrietta
,
to
be
willing
to
be
so
aggressive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
intensely
,
Isabel
,
''
said
Miss
Stackpole
with
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
love
me
intensely
let
me
as
intensely
alone
.
I
asked
that
*NL*
of
Mr.
Goodwood
,
and
I
must
also
ask
it
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
you
're
not
let
alone
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
Mr.
Goodwood
said
to
me
.
I
told
him
I
must
take
the
risks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
creature
of
risks
--
you
make
me
shudder
!
''
cried
Henrietta
.
*NL*
``
When
does
Mr.
Goodwood
return
to
America
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
he
did
n't
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
did
n't
enquire
,
''
said
Henrietta
with
the
note
of
righteous
*NL*
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
him
too
little
satisfaction
to
have
the
right
to
ask
questions
*NL*
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
assertion
seemed
to
Miss
Stackpole
for
a
moment
to
bid
defiance
to
*NL*
comment
;
but
at
last
she
exclaimed
:
``
Well
,
Isabel
,
if
I
did
n't
know
you
*NL*
I
might
think
you
were
heartless
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
,
''
said
Isabel
;
``
you
're
spoiling
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
've
done
that
already
.
I
hope
,
at
least
,
''
Miss
Stackpole
*NL*
added
,
``
that
he
may
cross
with
Annie
Climber
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
learned
from
her
the
next
morning
that
she
had
determined
not
to
*NL*
return
to
Gardencourt
-LRB-
where
old
Mr.
Touchett
had
promised
her
a
renewed
*NL*
welcome
-RRB-
,
but
to
await
in
London
the
arrival
of
the
invitation
that
Mr.
*NL*
Bantling
had
promised
her
from
his
sister
Lady
Pensil
.
Miss
Stackpole
*NL*
related
very
freely
her
conversation
with
Ralph
Touchett
's
sociable
*NL*
friend
and
declared
to
Isabel
that
she
really
believed
she
had
now
got
*NL*
hold
of
something
that
would
lead
to
something
.
On
the
receipt
of
Lady
*NL*
Pensil
's
letter
--
Mr.
Bantling
had
virtually
guaranteed
the
arrival
of
*NL*
this
document
--
she
would
immediately
depart
for
Bedfordshire
,
and
if
*NL*
Isabel
cared
to
look
out
for
her
impressions
in
the
Interviewer
*NL*
she
would
certainly
find
them
.
Henrietta
was
evidently
going
to
see
*NL*
something
of
the
inner
life
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
where
you
're
drifting
,
Henrietta
Stackpole
?
''
Isabel
asked
,
*NL*
imitating
the
tone
in
which
her
friend
had
spoken
the
night
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
drifting
to
a
big
position
--
that
of
the
Queen
of
American
*NL*
Journalism
.
If
my
next
letter
is
n't
copied
all
over
the
West
I
'll
*NL*
swallow
my
penwiper
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
arranged
with
her
friend
Miss
Annie
Climber
,
the
young
lady
*NL*
of
the
continental
offers
,
that
they
should
go
together
to
make
*NL*
those
purchases
which
were
to
constitute
Miss
Climber
's
farewell
to
a
*NL*
hemisphere
in
which
she
at
least
had
been
appreciated
;
and
she
presently
*NL*
repaired
to
Jermyn
Street
to
pick
up
her
companion
.
Shortly
after
her
*NL*
departure
Ralph
Touchett
was
announced
,
and
as
soon
as
he
came
in
Isabel
*NL*
saw
he
had
something
on
his
mind
.
He
very
soon
took
his
cousin
into
his
*NL*
confidence
.
He
had
received
from
his
mother
a
telegram
to
the
effect
*NL*
that
his
father
had
had
a
sharp
attack
of
his
old
malady
,
that
she
*NL*
was
much
alarmed
and
that
she
begged
he
would
instantly
return
to
*NL*
Gardencourt
.
On
this
occasion
at
least
Mrs.
Touchett
's
devotion
to
the
*NL*
electric
wire
was
not
open
to
criticism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
judged
it
best
to
see
the
great
doctor
,
Sir
Matthew
Hope
,
*NL*
first
,
''
Ralph
said
;
``
by
great
good
luck
he
's
in
town
.
He
's
to
see
me
*NL*
at
half-past
twelve
,
and
I
shall
make
sure
of
his
coming
down
to
*NL*
Gardencourt
--
which
he
will
do
the
more
readily
as
he
has
already
seen
*NL*
my
father
several
times
,
both
there
and
in
London
.
There
's
an
express
*NL*
at
two-forty-five
,
which
I
shall
take
;
and
you
'll
come
back
with
me
or
*NL*
remain
here
a
few
days
longer
,
exactly
as
you
prefer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
certainly
go
with
you
,
''
Isabel
returned
.
``
I
do
n't
suppose
I
can
*NL*
be
of
any
use
to
my
uncle
,
but
if
he
's
ill
I
shall
like
to
be
near
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
're
fond
of
him
,
''
said
Ralph
with
a
certain
shy
pleasure
*NL*
in
his
face
.
``
You
appreciate
him
,
which
all
the
world
has
n't
done
.
The
*NL*
quality
's
too
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
adore
him
,
''
Isabel
after
a
moment
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
well
.
After
his
son
he
's
your
greatest
admirer
.
''
She
*NL*
welcomed
this
assurance
,
but
she
gave
secretly
a
small
sigh
of
relief
*NL*
at
the
thought
that
Mr.
Touchett
was
one
of
those
admirers
who
could
n't
*NL*
propose
to
marry
her
.
This
,
however
,
was
not
what
she
spoke
;
she
went
on
*NL*
to
inform
Ralph
that
there
were
other
reasons
for
her
not
remaining
in
*NL*
London
.
She
was
tired
of
it
and
wished
to
leave
it
;
and
then
Henrietta
*NL*
was
going
away
--
going
to
stay
in
Bedfordshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Bedfordshire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
Lady
Pensil
,
the
sister
of
Mr.
Bantling
,
who
has
answered
for
an
*NL*
invitation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
was
feeling
anxious
,
but
at
this
he
broke
into
a
laugh
.
Suddenly
,
*NL*
none
the
less
,
his
gravity
returned
.
``
Bantling
's
a
man
of
courage
.
But
*NL*
if
the
invitation
should
get
lost
on
the
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
the
British
post-office
was
impeccable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
good
Homer
sometimes
nods
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
However
,
''
he
went
on
more
*NL*
brightly
,
``
the
good
Bantling
never
does
,
and
,
whatever
happens
,
he
'll
*NL*
take
care
of
Henrietta
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
went
to
keep
his
appointment
with
Sir
Matthew
Hope
,
and
Isabel
*NL*
made
her
arrangements
for
quitting
Pratt
's
Hotel
.
Her
uncle
's
danger
*NL*
touched
her
nearly
,
and
while
she
stood
before
her
open
trunk
,
looking
*NL*
about
her
vaguely
for
what
she
should
put
into
it
,
the
tears
suddenly
*NL*
rose
to
her
eyes
.
It
was
perhaps
for
this
reason
that
when
Ralph
came
*NL*
back
at
two
o'clock
to
take
her
to
the
station
she
was
not
yet
ready
.
He
*NL*
found
Miss
Stackpole
,
however
,
in
the
sitting-room
,
where
she
had
just
*NL*
risen
from
her
luncheon
,
and
this
lady
immediately
expressed
her
regret
*NL*
at
his
father
's
illness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
grand
old
man
,
''
she
said
;
``
he
's
faithful
to
the
last
.
If
it
's
*NL*
really
to
be
the
last
--
pardon
my
alluding
to
it
,
but
you
must
often
*NL*
have
thought
of
the
possibility
--
I
'm
sorry
that
I
shall
not
be
at
*NL*
Gardencourt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
amuse
yourself
much
more
in
Bedfordshire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
sorry
to
amuse
myself
at
such
a
time
,
''
said
Henrietta
*NL*
with
much
propriety
.
But
she
immediately
added
:
``
I
should
like
so
to
*NL*
commemorate
the
closing
scene
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
may
live
a
long
time
,
''
said
Ralph
simply
.
Then
,
adverting
*NL*
to
topics
more
cheerful
,
he
interrogated
Miss
Stackpole
as
to
her
own
*NL*
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
Ralph
was
in
trouble
she
addressed
him
in
a
tone
of
larger
*NL*
allowance
and
told
him
that
she
was
much
indebted
to
him
for
having
made
*NL*
her
acquainted
with
Mr.
Bantling
.
``
He
has
told
me
just
the
things
I
*NL*
want
to
know
,
''
she
said
;
``
all
the
society
items
and
all
about
the
royal
*NL*
family
.
I
ca
n't
make
out
that
what
he
tells
me
about
the
royal
family
is
*NL*
much
to
their
credit
;
but
he
says
that
's
only
my
peculiar
way
of
looking
*NL*
at
it
.
Well
,
all
I
want
is
that
he
should
give
me
the
facts
;
I
can
put
*NL*
them
together
quick
enough
,
once
I
've
got
them
.
''
And
she
added
that
Mr.
*NL*
Bantling
had
been
so
good
as
to
promise
to
come
and
take
her
out
that
*NL*
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
take
you
where
?
''
Ralph
ventured
to
enquire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Buckingham
Palace
.
He
's
going
to
show
me
over
it
,
so
that
I
may
get
*NL*
some
idea
how
they
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
we
leave
you
in
good
hands
.
The
first
thing
we
shall
*NL*
hear
is
that
you
're
invited
to
Windsor
Castle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
ask
me
,
I
shall
certainly
go
.
Once
I
get
started
I
'm
not
*NL*
afraid
.
But
for
all
that
,
''
Henrietta
added
in
a
moment
,
``
I
'm
not
*NL*
satisfied
;
I
'm
not
at
peace
about
Isabel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
her
last
misdemeanour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
told
you
before
,
and
I
suppose
there
's
no
harm
in
my
going
*NL*
on
.
I
always
finish
a
subject
that
I
take
up
.
Mr.
Goodwood
was
here
last
*NL*
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
opened
his
eyes
;
he
even
blushed
a
little
--
his
blush
being
*NL*
the
sign
of
an
emotion
somewhat
acute
.
He
remembered
that
Isabel
,
in
*NL*
separating
from
him
in
Winchester
Square
,
had
repudiated
his
suggestion
*NL*
that
her
motive
in
doing
so
was
the
expectation
of
a
visitor
at
Pratt
's
*NL*
Hotel
,
and
it
was
a
new
pang
to
him
to
have
to
suspect
her
of
duplicity
.
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
he
quickly
said
to
himself
,
what
concern
was
it
of
*NL*
his
that
she
should
have
made
an
appointment
with
a
lover
?
Had
it
not
*NL*
been
thought
graceful
in
every
age
that
young
ladies
should
make
a
*NL*
mystery
of
such
appointments
?
Ralph
gave
Miss
Stackpole
a
diplomatic
*NL*
answer
.
``
I
should
have
thought
that
,
with
the
views
you
expressed
to
me
*NL*
the
other
day
,
this
would
satisfy
you
perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
should
come
to
see
her
?
That
was
very
well
,
as
far
as
it
went
.
*NL*
It
was
a
little
plot
of
mine
;
I
let
him
know
that
we
were
in
London
,
and
*NL*
when
it
had
been
arranged
that
I
should
spend
the
evening
out
I
sent
him
*NL*
a
word
--
the
word
we
just
utter
to
the
`
wise
.
'
I
hoped
he
would
find
her
*NL*
alone
;
I
wo
n't
pretend
I
did
n't
hope
that
you
'd
be
out
of
the
way
.
He
*NL*
came
to
see
her
,
but
he
might
as
well
have
stayed
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabel
was
cruel
?
''
--
and
Ralph
's
face
lighted
with
the
relief
of
his
*NL*
cousin
's
not
having
shown
duplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
exactly
know
what
passed
between
them
.
But
she
gave
him
no
*NL*
satisfaction
--
she
sent
him
back
to
America
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Mr.
Goodwood
!
''
Ralph
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
only
idea
seems
to
be
to
get
rid
of
him
,
''
Henrietta
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Mr.
Goodwood
!
''
Ralph
repeated
.
The
exclamation
,
it
must
be
*NL*
confessed
,
was
automatic
;
it
failed
exactly
to
express
his
thoughts
,
*NL*
which
were
taking
another
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
that
as
if
you
felt
it
.
I
do
n't
believe
you
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
you
must
remember
that
I
do
n't
know
this
interesting
*NL*
young
man
--
that
I
've
never
seen
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
shall
see
him
,
and
I
shall
tell
him
not
to
give
up
.
If
I
did
n't
*NL*
believe
Isabel
would
come
round
,
''
Miss
Stackpole
added
--
``
well
,
I
'd
give
*NL*
up
myself
.
I
mean
I
'd
give
HER
up
!

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
occurred
to
Ralph
that
,
in
the
conditions
,
Isabel
's
parting
with
*NL*
her
friend
might
be
of
a
slightly
embarrassed
nature
,
and
he
went
down
*NL*
to
the
door
of
the
hotel
in
advance
of
his
cousin
,
who
,
after
a
slight
*NL*
delay
,
followed
with
the
traces
of
an
unaccepted
remonstrance
,
as
he
*NL*
thought
,
in
her
eyes
.
The
two
made
the
journey
to
Gardencourt
in
almost
*NL*
unbroken
silence
,
and
the
servant
who
met
them
at
the
station
had
no
*NL*
better
news
to
give
them
of
Mr.
Touchett
--
a
fact
which
caused
Ralph
to
*NL*
congratulate
himself
afresh
on
Sir
Matthew
Hope
's
having
promised
to
*NL*
come
down
in
the
five
o'clock
train
and
spend
the
night
.
Mrs.
Touchett
,
*NL*
he
learned
,
on
reaching
home
,
had
been
constantly
with
the
old
man
and
*NL*
was
with
him
at
that
moment
;
and
this
fact
made
Ralph
say
to
himself
*NL*
that
,
after
all
,
what
his
mother
wanted
was
just
easy
occasion
.
The
*NL*
finer
natures
were
those
that
shone
at
the
larger
times
.
Isabel
went
to
*NL*
her
own
room
,
noting
throughout
the
house
that
perceptible
hush
which
*NL*
precedes
a
crisis
.
At
the
end
of
an
hour
,
however
,
she
came
downstairs
*NL*
in
search
of
her
aunt
,
whom
she
wished
to
ask
about
Mr.
Touchett
.
She
*NL*
went
into
the
library
,
but
Mrs.
Touchett
was
not
there
,
and
as
the
*NL*
weather
,
which
had
been
damp
and
chill
,
was
now
altogether
spoiled
,
it
*NL*
was
not
probable
she
had
gone
for
her
usual
walk
in
the
grounds
.
Isabel
*NL*
was
on
the
point
of
ringing
to
send
a
question
to
her
room
,
when
this
*NL*
purpose
quickly
yielded
to
an
unexpected
sound
--
the
sound
of
low
music
*NL*
proceeding
apparently
from
the
saloon
.
She
knew
her
aunt
never
touched
*NL*
the
piano
,
and
the
musician
was
therefore
probably
Ralph
,
who
played
for
*NL*
his
own
amusement
.
That
he
should
have
resorted
to
this
recreation
at
*NL*
the
present
time
indicated
apparently
that
his
anxiety
about
his
father
*NL*
had
been
relieved
;
so
that
the
girl
took
her
way
,
almost
with
restored
*NL*
cheer
,
toward
the
source
of
the
harmony
.
The
drawing-room
at
Gardencourt
*NL*
was
an
apartment
of
great
distances
,
and
,
as
the
piano
was
placed
at
*NL*
the
end
of
it
furthest
removed
from
the
door
at
which
she
entered
,
her
*NL*
arrival
was
not
noticed
by
the
person
seated
before
the
instrument
.
*NL*
This
person
was
neither
Ralph
nor
his
mother
;
it
was
a
lady
whom
*NL*
Isabel
immediately
saw
to
be
a
stranger
to
herself
,
though
her
back
was
*NL*
presented
to
the
door
.
This
back
--
an
ample
and
well-dressed
one
--
Isabel
*NL*
viewed
for
some
moments
with
surprise
.
The
lady
was
of
course
a
visitor
*NL*
who
had
arrived
during
her
absence
and
who
had
not
been
mentioned
by
*NL*
either
of
the
servants
--
one
of
them
her
aunt
's
maid
--
of
whom
she
had
had
*NL*
speech
since
her
return
.
Isabel
had
already
learned
,
however
,
with
*NL*
what
treasures
of
reserve
the
function
of
receiving
orders
may
be
*NL*
accompanied
,
and
she
was
particularly
conscious
of
having
been
treated
*NL*
with
dryness
by
her
aunt
's
maid
,
through
whose
hands
she
had
slipped
*NL*
perhaps
a
little
too
mistrustfully
and
with
an
effect
of
plumage
but
*NL*
the
more
lustrous
.
The
advent
of
a
guest
was
in
itself
far
from
*NL*
disconcerting
;
she
had
not
yet
divested
herself
of
a
young
faith
that
*NL*
each
new
acquaintance
would
exert
some
momentous
influence
on
her
life
.
*NL*
By
the
time
she
had
made
these
reflexions
she
became
aware
that
the
*NL*
lady
at
the
piano
played
remarkably
well
.
She
was
playing
something
*NL*
of
Schubert
's
--
Isabel
knew
not
what
,
but
recognised
Schubert
--
and
she
*NL*
touched
the
piano
with
a
discretion
of
her
own
.
It
showed
skill
,
it
*NL*
showed
feeling
;
Isabel
sat
down
noiselessly
on
the
nearest
chair
and
*NL*
waited
till
the
end
of
the
piece
.
When
it
was
finished
she
felt
a
strong
*NL*
desire
to
thank
the
player
,
and
rose
from
her
seat
to
do
so
,
while
at
*NL*
the
same
time
the
stranger
turned
quickly
round
,
as
if
but
just
aware
of
*NL*
her
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
beautiful
,
and
your
playing
makes
it
more
beautiful
still
,
''
*NL*
said
Isabel
with
all
the
young
radiance
with
which
she
usually
uttered
a
*NL*
truthful
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
think
I
disturbed
Mr.
Touchett
then
?
''
the
musician
answered
*NL*
as
sweetly
as
this
compliment
deserved
.
``
The
house
is
so
large
and
his
*NL*
room
so
far
away
that
I
thought
I
might
venture
,
especially
as
I
played
*NL*
just
--
just
du
bout
des
doigts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
Frenchwoman
,
''
Isabel
said
to
herself
;
``
she
says
that
as
if
she
*NL*
were
French
.
''
And
this
supposition
made
the
visitor
more
interesting
to
*NL*
our
speculative
heroine
.
``
I
hope
my
uncle
's
doing
well
,
''
Isabel
added
.
*NL*
``
I
should
think
that
to
hear
such
lovely
music
as
that
would
really
make
*NL*
him
feel
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
smiled
and
discriminated
.
``
I
'm
afraid
there
are
moments
in
life
*NL*
when
even
Schubert
has
nothing
to
say
to
us
.
We
must
admit
,
however
,
*NL*
that
they
are
our
worst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
in
that
state
now
then
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
On
the
contrary
I
should
*NL*
be
so
glad
if
you
would
play
something
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
will
give
you
pleasure
--
delighted
.
''
And
this
obliging
person
took
*NL*
her
place
again
and
struck
a
few
chords
,
while
Isabel
sat
down
nearer
*NL*
the
instrument
.
Suddenly
the
new-comer
stopped
with
her
hands
on
the
*NL*
keys
,
half-turning
and
looking
over
her
shoulder
.
She
was
forty
years
*NL*
old
and
not
pretty
,
though
her
expression
charmed
.
``
Pardon
me
,
''
she
*NL*
said
;
``
but
are
you
the
niece
--
the
young
American
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
my
aunt
's
niece
,
''
Isabel
replied
with
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
at
the
piano
sat
still
a
moment
longer
,
casting
her
air
of
*NL*
interest
over
her
shoulder
.
``
That
's
very
well
;
we
're
compatriots
.
''
And
*NL*
then
she
began
to
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
she
's
not
French
,
''
Isabel
murmured
;
and
as
the
opposite
*NL*
supposition
had
made
her
romantic
it
might
have
seemed
that
this
*NL*
revelation
would
have
marked
a
drop
.
But
such
was
not
the
fact
;
rarer
*NL*
even
than
to
be
French
seemed
it
to
be
American
on
such
interesting
*NL*
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
played
in
the
same
manner
as
before
,
softly
and
solemnly
,
and
*NL*
while
she
played
the
shadows
deepened
in
the
room
.
The
autumn
twilight
*NL*
gathered
in
,
and
from
her
place
Isabel
could
see
the
rain
,
which
had
now
*NL*
begun
in
earnest
,
washing
the
cold-looking
lawn
and
the
wind
shaking
the
*NL*
great
trees
.
At
last
,
when
the
music
had
ceased
,
her
companion
got
up
*NL*
and
,
coming
nearer
with
a
smile
,
before
Isabel
had
time
to
thank
her
*NL*
again
,
said
:
``
I
'm
very
glad
you
've
come
back
;
I
've
heard
a
great
deal
*NL*
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
thought
her
a
very
attractive
person
,
but
nevertheless
spoke
with
*NL*
a
certain
abruptness
in
reply
to
this
speech
.
``
From
whom
have
you
heard
*NL*
about
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
hesitated
a
single
moment
and
then
,
``
From
your
uncle
,
''
she
*NL*
answered
.
``
I
've
been
here
three
days
,
and
the
first
day
he
let
me
come
*NL*
and
pay
him
a
visit
in
his
room
.
Then
he
talked
constantly
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
did
n't
know
me
that
must
rather
have
bored
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
made
me
want
to
know
you
.
All
the
more
that
since
then
--
your
aunt
*NL*
being
so
much
with
Mr.
Touchett
--
I
've
been
quite
alone
and
have
got
*NL*
rather
tired
of
my
own
society
.
I
've
not
chosen
a
good
moment
for
my
*NL*
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
servant
had
come
in
with
lamps
and
was
presently
followed
by
another
*NL*
bearing
the
tea-tray
.
On
the
appearance
of
this
repast
Mrs.
Touchett
had
*NL*
apparently
been
notified
,
for
she
now
arrived
and
addressed
herself
to
*NL*
the
tea-pot
.
Her
greeting
to
her
niece
did
not
differ
materially
from
*NL*
her
manner
of
raising
the
lid
of
this
receptacle
in
order
to
glance
at
*NL*
the
contents
:
in
neither
act
was
it
becoming
to
make
a
show
of
avidity
.
*NL*
Questioned
about
her
husband
she
was
unable
to
say
he
was
better
;
but
*NL*
the
local
doctor
was
with
him
,
and
much
light
was
expected
from
this
*NL*
gentleman
's
consultation
with
Sir
Matthew
Hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
two
ladies
have
made
acquaintance
,
''
she
pursued
.
``
If
you
*NL*
have
n't
I
recommend
you
to
do
so
;
for
so
long
as
we
continue
--
Ralph
and
*NL*
I
--
to
cluster
about
Mr.
Touchett
's
bed
you
're
not
likely
to
have
much
*NL*
society
but
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
about
you
but
that
you
're
a
great
musician
,
''
Isabel
said
*NL*
to
the
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
good
deal
more
than
that
to
know
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
affirmed
in
*NL*
her
little
dry
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
little
of
it
,
I
am
sure
,
will
content
Miss
Archer
!
''
the
lady
*NL*
exclaimed
with
a
light
laugh
.
``
I
'm
an
old
friend
of
your
aunt
's
.
*NL*
I
've
lived
much
in
Florence
.
I
'm
Madame
Merle
.
''
She
made
this
last
*NL*
announcement
as
if
she
were
referring
to
a
person
of
tolerably
distinct
*NL*
identity
.
For
Isabel
,
however
,
it
represented
little
;
she
could
only
*NL*
continue
to
feel
that
Madame
Merle
had
as
charming
a
manner
as
any
she
*NL*
had
ever
encountered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
a
foreigner
in
spite
of
her
name
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
born
--
I
always
forget
where
you
were
born
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
hardly
worth
while
then
I
should
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
,
who
rarely
missed
a
logical
*NL*
point
;
``
if
I
remembered
your
telling
me
would
be
quite
superfluous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
glanced
at
Isabel
with
a
sort
of
world-wide
smile
,
a
*NL*
thing
that
over-reached
frontiers
.
``
I
was
born
under
the
shadow
of
the
*NL*
national
banner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
too
fond
of
mystery
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
;
``
that
's
her
great
*NL*
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
exclaimed
Madame
Merle
,
``
I
've
great
faults
,
but
I
do
n't
think
*NL*
that
's
one
of
then
;
it
certainly
is
n't
the
greatest
.
I
came
into
the
*NL*
world
in
the
Brooklyn
navy-yard
.
My
father
was
a
high
officer
in
the
*NL*
United
States
Navy
,
and
had
a
post
--
a
post
of
responsibility
--
in
that
*NL*
establishment
at
the
time
.
I
suppose
I
ought
to
love
the
sea
,
but
I
hate
*NL*
it
.
That
's
why
I
do
n't
return
to
America
.
I
love
the
land
;
the
great
*NL*
thing
is
to
love
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
,
as
a
dispassionate
witness
,
had
not
been
struck
with
the
*NL*
force
of
Mrs.
Touchett
's
characterisation
of
her
visitor
,
who
had
an
*NL*
expressive
,
communicative
,
responsive
face
,
by
no
means
of
the
sort
*NL*
which
,
to
Isabel
's
mind
,
suggested
a
secretive
disposition
.
It
was
a
*NL*
face
that
told
of
an
amplitude
of
nature
and
of
quick
and
free
motions
*NL*
and
,
though
it
had
no
regular
beauty
,
was
in
the
highest
degree
engaging
*NL*
and
attaching
.
Madame
Merle
was
a
tall
,
fair
,
smooth
woman
;
everything
*NL*
in
her
person
was
round
and
replete
,
though
without
those
accumulations
*NL*
which
suggest
heaviness
.
Her
features
were
thick
but
in
perfect
*NL*
proportion
and
harmony
,
and
her
complexion
had
a
healthy
clearness
.
*NL*
Her
grey
eyes
were
small
but
full
of
light
and
incapable
of
*NL*
stupidity
--
incapable
,
according
to
some
people
,
even
of
tears
;
she
had
*NL*
a
liberal
,
full-rimmed
mouth
which
when
she
smiled
drew
itself
upward
to
*NL*
the
left
side
in
a
manner
that
most
people
thought
very
odd
,
some
very
*NL*
affected
and
a
few
very
graceful
.
Isabel
inclined
to
range
herself
in
*NL*
the
last
category
.
Madame
Merle
had
thick
,
fair
hair
,
arranged
somehow
*NL*
``
classically
''
and
as
if
she
were
a
Bust
,
Isabel
judged
--
a
Juno
or
a
*NL*
Niobe
;
and
large
white
hands
,
of
a
perfect
shape
,
a
shape
so
perfect
*NL*
that
their
possessor
,
preferring
to
leave
them
unadorned
,
wore
no
*NL*
jewelled
rings
.
Isabel
had
taken
her
at
first
,
as
we
have
seen
,
for
*NL*
a
Frenchwoman
;
but
extended
observation
might
have
ranked
her
as
a
*NL*
German
--
a
German
of
high
degree
,
perhaps
an
Austrian
,
a
baroness
,
a
*NL*
countess
,
a
princess
.
It
would
never
have
been
supposed
she
had
come
*NL*
into
the
world
in
Brooklyn
--
though
one
could
doubtless
not
have
carried
*NL*
through
any
argument
that
the
air
of
distinction
marking
her
in
so
*NL*
eminent
a
degree
was
inconsistent
with
such
a
birth
.
It
was
true
that
*NL*
the
national
banner
had
floated
immediately
over
her
cradle
,
and
the
*NL*
breezy
freedom
of
the
stars
and
stripes
might
have
shed
an
influence
*NL*
upon
the
attitude
she
there
took
towards
life
.
And
yet
she
had
evidently
*NL*
nothing
of
the
fluttered
,
flapping
quality
of
a
morsel
of
bunting
in
the
*NL*
wind
;
her
manner
expressed
the
repose
and
confidence
which
come
from
a
*NL*
large
experience
.
Experience
,
however
,
had
not
quenched
her
youth
;
it
*NL*
had
simply
made
her
sympathetic
and
supple
.
She
was
in
a
word
a
woman
of
*NL*
strong
impulses
kept
in
admirable
order
.
This
commended
itself
to
Isabel
*NL*
as
an
ideal
combination
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
made
these
reflexions
while
the
three
ladies
sat
at
their
tea
,
*NL*
but
that
ceremony
was
interrupted
before
long
by
the
arrival
of
the
*NL*
great
doctor
from
London
,
who
had
been
immediately
ushered
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
Mrs.
Touchett
took
him
off
to
the
library
for
a
private
*NL*
talk
;
and
then
Madame
Merle
and
Isabel
parted
,
to
meet
again
at
dinner
.
*NL*
The
idea
of
seeing
more
of
this
interesting
woman
did
much
to
mitigate
*NL*
Isabel
's
sense
of
the
sadness
now
settling
on
Gardencourt
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
came
into
the
drawing-room
before
dinner
she
found
the
place
*NL*
empty
;
but
in
the
course
of
a
moment
Ralph
arrived
.
His
anxiety
about
*NL*
his
father
had
been
lightened
;
Sir
Matthew
Hope
's
view
of
his
condition
*NL*
was
less
depressed
than
his
own
had
been
.
The
doctor
recommended
that
*NL*
the
nurse
alone
should
remain
with
the
old
man
for
the
next
three
or
*NL*
four
hours
;
so
that
Ralph
,
his
mother
and
the
great
physician
himself
*NL*
were
free
to
dine
at
table
.
Mrs.
Touchett
and
Sir
Matthew
appeared
;
*NL*
Madame
Merle
was
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
she
came
Isabel
spoke
of
her
to
Ralph
,
who
was
standing
before
*NL*
the
fireplace
.
``
Pray
who
is
this
Madame
Merle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cleverest
woman
I
know
,
not
excepting
yourself
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
she
seemed
very
pleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sure
you
'd
think
her
very
pleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
why
you
invited
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
invite
her
,
and
when
we
came
back
from
London
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
she
was
here
.
No
one
invited
her
.
She
's
a
friend
of
my
mother
's
,
and
*NL*
just
after
you
and
I
went
to
town
my
mother
got
a
note
from
her
.
She
had
*NL*
arrived
in
England
-LRB-
she
usually
lives
abroad
,
though
she
has
first
and
*NL*
last
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
here
-RRB-
,
and
asked
leave
to
come
down
for
*NL*
a
few
days
.
She
's
a
woman
who
can
make
such
proposals
with
perfect
*NL*
confidence
;
she
's
so
welcome
wherever
she
goes
.
And
with
my
mother
there
*NL*
could
be
no
question
of
hesitating
;
she
's
the
one
person
in
the
world
*NL*
whom
my
mother
very
much
admires
.
If
she
were
not
herself
-LRB-
which
she
*NL*
after
all
much
prefers
-RRB-
,
she
would
like
to
be
Madame
Merle
.
It
would
*NL*
indeed
be
a
great
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
's
very
charming
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
And
she
plays
beautifully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
everything
beautifully
.
She
's
complete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
looked
at
her
cousin
a
moment
.
``
You
do
n't
like
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
was
once
in
love
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
did
n't
care
for
you
,
and
that
's
why
you
do
n't
like
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
we
have
discussed
such
things
?
Monsieur
Merle
was
then
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
dead
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
believe
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
because
the
statement
agrees
with
the
probabilities
.
The
husband
*NL*
of
Madame
Merle
would
be
likely
to
pass
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
gazed
at
her
cousin
again
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
.
You
mean
*NL*
something
--
that
you
do
n't
mean
.
What
was
Monsieur
Merle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
husband
of
Madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
odious
.
Has
she
any
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
least
little
child
--
fortunately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortunately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
fortunately
for
the
child
.
She
'd
be
sure
to
spoil
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
apparently
on
the
point
of
assuring
her
cousin
for
the
third
*NL*
time
that
he
was
odious
;
but
the
discussion
was
interrupted
by
the
*NL*
arrival
of
the
lady
who
was
the
topic
of
it
.
She
came
rustling
in
*NL*
quickly
,
apologising
for
being
late
,
fastening
a
bracelet
,
dressed
in
*NL*
dark
blue
satin
,
which
exposed
a
white
bosom
that
was
ineffectually
*NL*
covered
by
a
curious
silver
necklace
.
Ralph
offered
her
his
arm
with
the
*NL*
exaggerated
alertness
of
a
man
who
was
no
longer
a
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
if
this
had
still
been
his
condition
,
however
,
Ralph
had
other
*NL*
things
to
think
about
.
The
great
doctor
spent
the
night
at
Gardencourt
*NL*
and
,
returning
to
London
on
the
morrow
,
after
another
consultation
with
*NL*
Mr.
Touchett
's
own
medical
adviser
,
concurred
in
Ralph
's
desire
that
he
*NL*
should
see
the
patient
again
on
the
day
following
.
On
the
day
following
*NL*
Sir
Matthew
Hope
reappeared
at
Gardencourt
,
and
now
took
a
less
*NL*
encouraging
view
of
the
old
man
,
who
had
grown
worse
in
the
twenty-four
*NL*
hours
.
His
feebleness
was
extreme
,
and
to
his
son
,
who
constantly
sat
*NL*
by
his
bedside
,
it
often
seemed
that
his
end
must
be
at
hand
.
The
local
*NL*
doctor
,
a
very
sagacious
man
,
in
whom
Ralph
had
secretly
more
confidence
*NL*
than
in
his
distinguished
colleague
,
was
constantly
in
attendance
,
and
*NL*
Sir
Matthew
Hope
came
back
several
times
.
Mr.
Touchett
was
much
of
the
*NL*
time
unconscious
;
he
slept
a
great
deal
;
he
rarely
spoke
.
Isabel
had
a
*NL*
great
desire
to
be
useful
to
him
and
was
allowed
to
watch
with
him
at
*NL*
hours
when
his
other
attendants
-LRB-
of
whom
Mrs.
Touchett
was
not
the
least
*NL*
regular
-RRB-
went
to
take
rest
.
He
never
seemed
to
know
her
,
and
she
always
*NL*
said
to
herself
``
Suppose
he
should
die
while
I
'm
sitting
here
;
''
an
idea
*NL*
which
excited
her
and
kept
her
awake
.
Once
he
opened
his
eyes
for
a
*NL*
while
and
fixed
them
upon
her
intelligently
,
but
when
she
went
to
him
,
*NL*
hoping
he
would
recognise
her
,
he
closed
them
and
relapsed
into
stupor
.
*NL*
The
day
after
this
,
however
,
he
revived
for
a
longer
time
;
but
on
this
*NL*
occasion
Ralph
only
was
with
him
.
The
old
man
began
to
talk
,
much
to
his
*NL*
son
's
satisfaction
,
who
assured
him
that
they
should
presently
have
him
*NL*
sitting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
boy
,
''
said
Mr.
Touchett
,
``
not
unless
you
bury
me
in
a
sitting
*NL*
posture
,
as
some
of
the
ancients
--
was
it
the
ancients
?
--
used
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
daddy
,
do
n't
talk
about
that
,
''
Ralph
murmured
.
``
You
must
n't
deny
*NL*
that
you
're
getting
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
will
be
no
need
of
my
denying
it
if
you
do
n't
say
it
,
''
the
old
*NL*
man
answered
.
``
Why
should
we
prevaricate
just
at
the
last
?
We
never
*NL*
prevaricated
before
.
I
've
got
to
die
some
time
,
and
it
's
better
to
die
*NL*
when
one
's
sick
than
when
one
's
well
.
I
'm
very
sick
--
as
sick
as
I
shall
*NL*
ever
be
.
I
hope
you
do
n't
want
to
prove
that
I
shall
ever
be
worse
than
*NL*
this
?
That
would
be
too
bad
.
You
do
n't
?
Well
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
made
this
excellent
point
he
became
quiet
;
but
the
next
time
that
*NL*
Ralph
was
with
him
he
again
addressed
himself
to
conversation
.
The
*NL*
nurse
had
gone
to
her
supper
and
Ralph
was
alone
in
charge
,
having
just
*NL*
relieved
Mrs.
Touchett
,
who
had
been
on
guard
since
dinner
.
The
room
was
*NL*
lighted
only
by
the
flickering
fire
,
which
of
late
had
become
necessary
,
*NL*
and
Ralph
's
tall
shadow
was
projected
over
wall
and
ceiling
with
an
*NL*
outline
constantly
varying
but
always
grotesque
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
with
me
--
is
it
my
son
?
''
the
old
man
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
your
son
,
daddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
there
no
one
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Touchett
said
nothing
for
a
while
;
and
then
,
``
I
want
to
talk
a
*NL*
little
,
''
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
it
tire
you
?
''
Ralph
demurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
matter
if
it
does
.
I
shall
have
a
long
rest
.
I
want
to
talk
*NL*
about
YOU
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
had
drawn
nearer
to
the
bed
;
he
sat
leaning
forward
with
his
hand
*NL*
on
his
father
's
.
``
You
had
better
select
a
brighter
topic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
always
bright
;
I
used
to
be
proud
of
your
brightness

I
should
*NL*
like
so
much
to
think
you
'd
do
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
leave
us
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
I
shall
do
nothing
but
miss
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
do
n't
want

it
's
what
I
want
to

get

*NL*
*NL*

I
do
n't

*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
lay
there
looking
at
his
son
;
his
face
was
the
face
of
the
*NL*
dying
,
but
his
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
Daniel
Touchett
.
He
seemed
to
be
*NL*
reckoning
over
Ralph
's
interests
.
``
Of
course
you
have
your
mother
,
''
he
*NL*
said
at
last
.
``
You
'll
take
care
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
will
always
take
care
of
herself
,
''
Ralph
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
his
father
,
``
perhaps
as
she
grows
older
she
'll
need
a
*NL*
little
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
see
that

She
'll
outlive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
she
will
;
but
that
's
no
reason

!
''
Mr.
Touchett
let
his
*NL*
phrase
die
away
in
a
helpless
but
not
quite
querulous
sigh
and
remained
*NL*
silent
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
about
us
,
''
said
his
son
,
``
My
mother
and
I
get
on
*NL*
very
well
together

you
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
get
on

always
being
apart

not
natural

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
leave
us
we
shall
probably
see
more
of

other

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
the
old
man
observed
with
wandering
irrelevance
,
``
it
ca
n't
be
*NL*
said
that
my
death
will
make
much
difference
in
your
mother
's
life

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
probably
make
more

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
'll
have
more
money

said
Mr.
Touchett
.
``
I
've
left

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
been
one

She
has
never

troubled

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
some
troubles
are
pleasant
,
''
Mr.
Touchett
murmured
.
``
Those
you
've
*NL*
given
me
for
instance
.
But
your
mother
has
been
less
--
less
--
what
shall
*NL*
I
call
it
?
less
out
of
the
way
since
I
've
been
ill

I

she
knows

I
've
noticed
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
certainly
tell

so

so
glad

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

She
does
it

please

to
please

And
he
lay
a
while
trying
to
think
*NL*
why
she
did
it
.
``
She
does
it
because
it
suits
her
.
But
that
's
not
what
*NL*
I
want
to
talk
about

he
added
.
``
It
's
about
you
.
You
'll
be
very
well
*NL*
off

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
I
know
that

I

you

not

the
*NL*
talk
we
had
a
year
ago

when
I
told
you
exactly
what
money
I
should
need
*NL*
and
begged
you
to
make
some
good
use
of
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
remember
.
I
made
a
new
will
--
in
a
few
days
.
I
suppose
it
*NL*
was
the
first
time
such
a
thing
had
happened
--
a
young
man
trying
to
get
*NL*
a
will
made
against
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
against
me
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
It
would
be
against
me
to
have
a
*NL*
large
property
to
take
care
of
.
It
's
impossible
for
a
man
in
my
state
of
*NL*
health
to
spend
much
money
,
and
enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
'll
have

there
will
be
enough
for
two

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
too
much

said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

do

say
that

The
best
thing
you
can
do

when
I

gone

will
be
*NL*
to
marry

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
had
foreseen
what
his
father
was
coming
to
,
and
this
suggestion
*NL*
was
by
no
means
fresh
.
It
had
long
been
Mr.
Touchett
's
most
ingenious
*NL*
way
of
taking
the
cheerful
view
of
his
son
's
possible
duration
.
Ralph
*NL*
had
usually
treated
it
facetiously
;
but
present
circumstances
proscribed
*NL*
the
facetious
.
He
simply
fell
back
in
his
chair
and
returned
his
*NL*
father
's
appealing
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
,
with
a
wife
who
has
n't
been
very
fond
of
me
,
have
had
a
very
*NL*
happy
life
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
carrying
his
ingenuity
further
still
,
*NL*
``
what
a
life
might
n't
you
have
if
you
should
marry
a
person
different
*NL*
from
Mrs.
Touchett
.
There
are
more
different
from
her
than
there
are
*NL*
like
her
.
''
Ralph
still
said
nothing
;
and
after
a
pause
his
father
*NL*
resumed
softly
:
``
What
do
you
think
of
your
cousin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Ralph
started
,
meeting
the
question
with
a
strained
smile
.
``
Do
I
*NL*
understand
you
to
propose
that
I
should
marry
Isabel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
what
it
comes
to
in
the
end
.
Do
n't
you
like
Isabel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
much
.
''
And
Ralph
got
up
from
his
chair
and
wandered
over
to
*NL*
the
fire
.
He
stood
before
it
an
instant
and
then
he
stooped
and
stirred
*NL*
it
mechanically
.
``
I
like
Isabel
very
much
,
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
his
father
,
``
I
know
she
likes
you
.
She
has
told
me
how
much
*NL*
she
likes
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
remark
that
she
would
like

marry

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

she
ca
n't
have
anything

she
's
the
most
*NL*
charming
young
lady
I
've
ever
seen
.
And
she
would
be
good
to
you

I
have
*NL*
thought
a
great
deal
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
have
I
,
''
said
Ralph
,
coming
back
to
the
bedside
again
.
``
I
do
n't
mind
*NL*
telling
you
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ARE
in
love
with
her
then

I
should

she
came
over
on
purpose

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
'm
not
in

I
should

were
different

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
things
are
always
different

said
the
old
*NL*
man
.
``
If

wait

to
change

never

he
went
on
;
``
but
I
suppose
there
's
no
harm
in
*NL*
my
alluding
to
it
at
such
an
hour
as
this
:
there
was
some
one
wanted
to
*NL*
marry
Isabel
the
other

she
would
n't
have
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

told

*NL*
*NL*
``

there
's
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody

his

the

got
nothing

by

*NL*
*NL*
``
Was

you

Mr.
Touchett
eagerly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

friend

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
'm
sorry
for
him

whoever
he
was

But
it
only
proves
what
I
*NL*
say
--
that
the
way
's
open
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
,
dear
father
,
it
's
all
the
greater
pity
that
I
'm
unable

tread
it
.
I
have
n't
many
convictions
;
but
I
have
three
or
four
that
I
*NL*
hold
strongly
.
One
is
that
people
,
on
the
whole
,
had
better
not
marry
*NL*
their
cousins

Another
is
that
people
in
an
advanced

disorder
had

The
old
man
raised
his
weak
hand
and
moved
it
to
and
fro
before
his
*NL*
face
.
``
What
do
you
mean
by
that

You
look
at
things
in
a
way
that
would
*NL*
make
everything

What
sort
of
a
cousin
is
a
cousin
that
you
*NL*
had
never
seen
for
more
than
twenty
years
of
her
life

We
're
all
each
*NL*
other

cousins

if
we
stopped
at
that
the
human
race
would
die
out

*NL*
It

just
the

You
're
a
great

better

All
you
want

to
lead
a
natural

It

a
great
*NL*
deal
more
natural
to
marry
a
pretty
young

're

remain
single
on

Ralph

marvelled
at

at

finding

Ralph
leaned
back
in

some

Something

Touchett

the

``
Do
you
want
me
to
make
a
new

*NL*
*NL*

A
few
words
will
do
it

can
attend

*NL*
*NL*

You

You
shall

to-morrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
think

said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
probably

I
shall
like

Ralph
,
smiling
;

I
give

quite
horrid

strange

The
humour
of
this
appeared
to
touch
his
father
,
who
lay
a
little
while
*NL*
taking
it
in
.
``
I
'll
do
anything
you
like

Mr.
Touchett
said
at
last
;
*NL*
``
but
I
'm
not
sure
it
's
right

You
say
you
want
to
put
wind
in
her

are
n't
you
afraid
of
putting
too
much
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like

see
her
going

Ralph

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
as
if
it

a
good
deal

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
think
I
understand
,
''
said
Mr.
Touchett
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
``
Young
men
are
very
different
from
what
I
was
.
When
I
cared
for
a
*NL*
girl
--
when
I
was
young
--
I
wanted
to
do
more
than
look
at
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
scruples
that
I
should
n't
have
had
,
and
you
've
ideas
that
I
*NL*
should
n't
have
had
either
.
You
say
Isabel
wants
to
be
free
,
and
that
*NL*
her
being
rich
will
keep
her
from
marrying
for
money
.
Do
you
think
that
*NL*
she
's
a
girl
to
do
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
.
But
she
has
less
money
than
she
has
ever
had
before
.
Her
*NL*
father
then
gave
her
everything
,
because
he
used
to
spend
his
capital
.
*NL*
She
has
nothing
but
the
crumbs

that
feast
to
live
on
,

she
does

*NL*
really

how
meagre
they

she

yet
to

My

told
me
all
about
it

Isabel
will
learn
it
when
she
's
really
thrown
upon
*NL*
the
world
,
and
it
would
be
very
painful
to
me
to
think
of
her
coming
to
*NL*
the
consciousness
of
a

of
wants
she
should
be
unable
to
satisfy
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

left
her

a
good

*NL*
*NL*

She
can
indeed

she

probably
spend
it

two

three
years

*NL*
``
You
think
she
'd
be
extravagant
then

*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
certainly

said
Ralph
,
smiling
serenely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mr.
Touchett
's
acuteness
was
rapidly
giving
place
to
pure
*NL*
confusion
.
``
It
would
merely
be
a
question
of
time
then

her
spending
the
*NL*
larger
sum
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
though
at
first
I
think
she
'd
plunge
into
that
pretty
freely
:
she

*NL*
probably
make
over
a
part
of
it
to
each
of
her

But
after
that
*NL*
she

come
to
her

remember
she
has
still
a
lifetime
before

live
within
her
means

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
HAVE
worked
it
out
,

said
the
old
man
helplessly
.
``
You
do
*NL*
take
an
interest
in
her
,
certainly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca

consistently

I

You
wished
me
to
go
further

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know

''
Mr.
Touchett
answered
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
enter
into
*NL*
your
spirit

It
seems
to
me
immoral

*NL*
*NL*
``
Immoral

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
surely
depends
upon
the
person

When

your
making

to
the
credit

of
good
impulses

what
can
be
a
nobler
act

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
little
difficult
to
follow
,
and
Mr.
Touchett
considered
it
*NL*
for
a
while
.
At
last
he
said
:
``
Isabel
's
a
sweet
young
thing
;
but
do
you
*NL*
think
she
's
so
good
as
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
as
good
as
her
best
opportunities

''
Ralph
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Mr.
Touchett
declared
,
``
she
ought
to
get
a
great
many
*NL*
opportunities
for
sixty
thousand
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
doubt
she
will

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
'll
do
what
you
want

''
said
the
old
man
.
``
I
only
want
to
*NL*
understand
it
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
dear
daddy
,
do
n't
you
understand
it
now

''
his
son
caressingly
*NL*
asked
.
``
If
you

n't

'll
*NL*
leave
it
alone

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Touchett
lay
a
long
time
still
.
Ralph
supposed
he
had
given
up
the
*NL*
attempt
to
follow
.
But
at
last
,
quite
lucidly
,
he
began
again
.
``
Tell
*NL*
me
this
first
.
Does
n't
it
occur
to
you
that
a
young
lady
with
sixty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
may
fall
a
victim
to
the
fortune-hunters
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
hardly
fall
a
victim

*NL*
*NL*
``

too
many

*NL*
*NL*
``

appreciable

small

it

*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mr.
Touchett
's
acuteness
had
passed
into
perplexity
,
and
his
*NL*
perplexity
now
passed
into
admiration
.
``
Well

you
have
gone
into
it

he
*NL*
repeated
.

*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
leaned
over
his
father
's
pillows
and
gently
smoothed
them
;
he
was
*NL*
aware
their
talk
had
been
unduly
prolonged
.
``
I
shall
get
just
the
good

I
said

moments

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mrs.
Touchett
had
foretold
,
Isabel
and
Madame
Merle
were
thrown
*NL*
much
together
during
the
illness
of
their
host
,
so
that
if
they
had
*NL*
not
become
intimate
it
would
have
been
almost
a
breach
of
good
manners
.
*NL*
Their
manners
were
of
the
best
,
but
in
addition
to
this
they
happened
*NL*
to
please
each
other
.
It
is
perhaps
too
much
to
say
that
they
swore
*NL*
an
eternal
friendship
,
but
tacitly
at
least
they
called
the
future
to
*NL*
witness
.
Isabel
did
so
with
a
perfectly
good
conscience
,
though
she
*NL*
would
have
hesitated
to
admit
she
was
intimate
with
her
new
friend
in
*NL*
the
high
sense
she
privately
attached
to
this
term
.
She
often
wondered
*NL*
indeed
if
she
ever
had
been
,
or
ever
could
be
,
intimate
with
any
one
.
*NL*
She
had
an
ideal
of
friendship
as
well
as
of
several
other
sentiments
,
*NL*
which
it
failed
to
seem
to
her
in
this
case
--
it
had
not
seemed
to
her
*NL*
in
other
cases
--
that
the
actual
completely
expressed
.
But
she
often
*NL*
reminded
herself
that
there
were
essential
reasons
why
one
's
ideal
*NL*
could
never
become
concrete
.
It
was
a
thing
to
believe
in
,
not
to
see
--
a
*NL*
matter
of
faith
,
not
of
experience
.
Experience
,
however
,
might
supply
*NL*
us
with
very
creditable
imitations
of
it
,
and
the
part
of
wisdom
was
*NL*
to
make
the
best
of
these
.
Certainly
,
on
the
whole
,
Isabel
had
never
*NL*
encountered
a
more
agreeable
and
interesting
figure
than
Madame
Merle
;
*NL*
she
had
never
met
a
person
having
less
of
that
fault
which
is
the
*NL*
principal
obstacle
to
friendship
--
the
air
of
reproducing
the
more
*NL*
tiresome
,
the
stale
,
the
too-familiar
parts
of
one
's
own
character
.
*NL*
The
gates
of
the
girl
's
confidence
were
opened
wider
than
they
had
ever
*NL*
been
;
she
said
things
to
this
amiable
auditress
that
she
had
not
yet
*NL*
said
to
any
one
.
Sometimes
she
took
alarm
at
her
candour
:
it
was
as
*NL*
if
she
had
given
to
a
comparative
stranger
the
key
to
her
cabinet
of
*NL*
jewels
.
These
spiritual
gems
were
the
only
ones
of
any
magnitude
that
*NL*
Isabel
possessed
,
but
there
was
all
the
greater
reason
for
their
being
*NL*
carefully
guarded
.
Afterwards
,
however
,
she
always
remembered
that
one
*NL*
should
never
regret
a
generous
error
and
that
if
Madame
Merle
had
not
*NL*
the
merits
she
attributed
to
her
,
so
much
the
worse
for
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
There
was
no
doubt
she
had
great
merits
--
she
was
charming
,
sympathetic
,
*NL*
intelligent
,
cultivated
.
More
than
this
-LRB-
for
it
had
not
been
Isabel
's
*NL*
ill-fortune
to
go
through
life
without
meeting
in
her
own
sex
several
*NL*
persons
of
whom
no
less
could
fairly
be
said
-RRB-
,
she
was
rare
,
superior
*NL*
and
preeminent
.
There
are
many
amiable
people
in
the
world
,
and
Madame
*NL*
Merle
was
far
from
being
vulgarly
good-natured
and
restlessly
witty
.
She
*NL*
knew
how
to
think
--
an
accomplishment
rare
in
women
;
and
she
had
thought
*NL*
to
very
good
purpose
.
Of
course
,
too
,
she
knew
how
to
feel
;
Isabel
*NL*
could
n't
have
spent
a
week
with
her
without
being
sure
of
that
.
This
was
*NL*
indeed
Madame
Merle
's
great
talent
,
her
most
perfect
gift
.
Life
had
told
*NL*
upon
her
;
she
had
felt
it
strongly
,
and
it
was
part
of
the
satisfaction
*NL*
to
be
taken
in
her
society
that
when
the
girl
talked
of
what
she
was
*NL*
pleased
to
call
serious
matters
this
lady
understood
her
so
easily
and
*NL*
quickly
.
Emotion
,
it
is
true
,
had
become
with
her
rather
historic
;
she
*NL*
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
the
fount
of
passion
,
thanks
to
having
*NL*
been
rather
violently
tapped
at
one
period
,
did
n't
flow
quite
so
*NL*
freely
as
of
yore
.
She
proposed
moreover
,
as
well
as
expected
,
to
cease
*NL*
feeling
;
she
freely
admitted
that
of
old
she
had
been
a
little
mad
,
and
*NL*
now
she
pretended
to
be
perfectly
sane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
judge
more
than
I
used
to
,
''
she
said
to
Isabel
,
``
but
it
seems
to
me
*NL*
one
has
earned
the
right
.
One
ca
n't
judge
till
one
's
forty
;
before
that
*NL*
we
're
too
eager
,
too
hard
,
too
cruel
,
and
in
addition
much
too
ignorant
.
*NL*
I
'm
sorry
for
you
;
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
you
're
forty
.
But
every
*NL*
gain
's
a
loss
of
some
kind
;
I
often
think
that
after
forty
one
ca
n't
*NL*
really
feel
.
The
freshness
,
the
quickness
have
certainly
gone
.
You
'll
*NL*
keep
them
longer
than
most
people
;
it
will
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
*NL*
to
see
you
some
years
hence
.
I
want
to
see
what
life
makes
of
you
.
One
*NL*
thing
's
certain
--
it
ca
n't
spoil
you
.
It
may
pull
you
about
horribly
,
but
*NL*
I
defy
it
to
break
you
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
received
this
assurance
as
a
young
soldier
,
still
panting
from
*NL*
a
slight
skirmish
in
which
he
has
come
off
with
honour
,
might
receive
a
*NL*
pat
on
the
shoulder
from
his
colonel
.
Like
such
a
recognition
of
merit
*NL*
it
seemed
to
come
with
authority
.
How
could
the
lightest
word
do
less
*NL*
on
the
part
of
a
person
who
was
prepared
to
say
,
of
almost
everything
*NL*
Isabel
told
her
,
``
Oh
,
I
've
been
in
that
,
my
dear
;
it
passes
,
like
*NL*
everything
else
.
''
On
many
of
her
interlocutors
Madame
Merle
might
have
*NL*
produced
an
irritating
effect
;
it
was
disconcertingly
difficult
to
*NL*
surprise
her
.
But
Isabel
,
though
by
no
means
incapable
of
desiring
to
*NL*
be
effective
,
had
not
at
present
this
impulse
.
She
was
too
sincere
,
too
*NL*
interested
in
her
judicious
companion
.
And
then
moreover
Madame
Merle
*NL*
never
said
such
things
in
the
tone
of
triumph
or
of
boastfulness
;
they
*NL*
dropped
from
her
like
cold
confessions
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
period
of
bad
weather
had
settled
upon
Gardencourt
;
the
days
grew
*NL*
shorter
and
there
was
an
end
to
the
pretty
tea-parties
on
the
lawn
.
But
*NL*
our
young
woman
had
long
indoor
conversations
with
her
fellow
visitor
,
*NL*
and
in
spite
of
the
rain
the
two
ladies
often
sallied
forth
for
a
walk
,
*NL*
equipped
with
the
defensive
apparatus
which
the
English
climate
and
*NL*
the
English
genius
have
between
them
brought
to
such
perfection
.
Madame
*NL*
Merle
liked
almost
everything
,
including
the
English
rain
.
``
There
's
*NL*
always
a
little
of
it
and
never
too
much
at
once
,
''
she
said
;
``
and
it
*NL*
never
wets
you
and
it
always
smells
good
.
''
She
declared
that
in
England
*NL*
the
pleasures
of
smell
were
great
--
that
in
this
inimitable
island
there
*NL*
was
a
certain
mixture
of
fog
and
beer
and
soot
which
,
however
odd
it
*NL*
might
sound
,
was
the
national
aroma
,
and
was
most
agreeable
to
the
*NL*
nostril
;
and
she
used
to
lift
the
sleeve
of
her
British
overcoat
and
*NL*
bury
her
nose
in
it
,
inhaling
the
clear
,
fine
scent
of
the
wool
.
Poor
*NL*
Ralph
Touchett
,
as
soon
as
the
autumn
had
begun
to
define
itself
,
became
*NL*
almost
a
prisoner
;
in
bad
weather
he
was
unable
to
step
out
of
the
*NL*
house
,
and
he
used
sometimes
to
stand
at
one
of
the
windows
with
his
*NL*
hands
in
his
pockets
and
,
from
a
countenance
half-rueful
,
half-critical
,
*NL*
watch
Isabel
and
Madame
Merle
as
they
walked
down
the
avenue
under
a
*NL*
pair
of
umbrellas
.
The
roads
about
Gardencourt
were
so
firm
,
even
in
the
*NL*
worst
weather
,
that
the
two
ladies
always
came
back
with
a
healthy
glow
*NL*
in
their
cheeks
,
looking
at
the
soles
of
their
neat
,
stout
boots
and
*NL*
declaring
that
their
walk
had
done
them
inexpressible
good
.
Before
*NL*
luncheon
,
always
,
Madame
Merle
was
engaged
;
Isabel
admired
and
envied
*NL*
her
rigid
possession
of
her
morning
.
Our
heroine
had
always
passed
for
a
*NL*
person
of
resources
and
had
taken
a
certain
pride
in
being
one
;
but
she
*NL*
wandered
,
as
by
the
wrong
side
of
the
wall
of
a
private
garden
,
round
*NL*
the
enclosed
talents
,
accomplishments
,
aptitudes
of
Madame
Merle
.
She
*NL*
found
herself
desiring
to
emulate
them
,
and
in
twenty
such
ways
this
*NL*
lady
presented
herself
as
a
model
.
``
I
should
like
awfully
to
be
so
!
''
*NL*
Isabel
secretly
exclaimed
,
more
than
once
,
as
one
after
another
of
her
*NL*
friend
's
fine
aspects
caught
the
light
,
and
before
long
she
knew
that
*NL*
she
had
learned
a
lesson
from
a
high
authority
.
It
took
no
great
time
*NL*
indeed
for
her
to
feel
herself
,
as
the
phrase
is
,
under
an
influence
.
*NL*
``
What
's
the
harm
,
''
she
wondered
,
``
so
long
as
it
's
a
good
one
?
The
more
*NL*
one
's
under
a
good
influence
the
better
.
The
only
thing
is
to
see
our
*NL*
steps
as
we
take
them
--
to
understand
them
as
we
go
.
That
,
no
doubt
,
I
*NL*
shall
always
do
.
I
need
n't
be
afraid
of
becoming
too
pliable
;
is
n't
it
*NL*
my
fault
that
I
'm
not
pliable
enough
?
''
It
is
said
that
imitation
is
the
*NL*
sincerest
flattery
;
and
if
Isabel
was
sometimes
moved
to
gape
at
her
*NL*
friend
aspiringly
and
despairingly
it
was
not
so
much
because
she
*NL*
desired
herself
to
shine
as
because
she
wished
to
hold
up
the
lamp
for
*NL*
Madame
Merle
.
She
liked
her
extremely
,
but
was
even
more
dazzled
than
*NL*
attracted
.
She
sometimes
asked
herself
what
Henrietta
Stackpole
would
*NL*
say
to
her
thinking
so
much
of
this
perverted
product
of
their
common
*NL*
soil
,
and
had
a
conviction
that
it
would
be
severely
judged
.
Henrietta
*NL*
would
not
at
all
subscribe
to
Madame
Merle
;
for
reasons
she
could
not
*NL*
have
defined
this
truth
came
home
to
the
girl
.
On
the
other
hand
she
*NL*
was
equally
sure
that
,
should
the
occasion
offer
,
her
new
friend
would
*NL*
strike
off
some
happy
view
of
her
old
:
Madame
Merle
was
too
humorous
,
*NL*
too
observant
,
not
to
do
justice
to
Henrietta
,
and
on
becoming
*NL*
acquainted
with
her
would
probably
give
the
measure
of
a
tact
which
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
could
n't
hope
to
emulate
.
She
appeared
to
have
in
her
*NL*
experience
a
touchstone
for
everything
,
and
somewhere
in
the
capacious
*NL*
pocket
of
her
genial
memory
she
would
find
the
key
to
Henrietta
's
value
.
*NL*
``
That
's
the
great
thing
,
''
Isabel
solemnly
pondered
;
``
that
's
the
supreme
*NL*
good
fortune
:
to
be
in
a
better
position
for
appreciating
people
than
*NL*
they
are
for
appreciating
you
.
''
And
she
added
that
such
,
when
one
*NL*
considered
it
,
was
simply
the
essence
of
the
aristocratic
situation
.
*NL*
In
this
light
,
if
in
none
other
,
one
should
aim
at
the
aristocratic
*NL*
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
may
not
count
over
all
the
links
in
the
chain
which
led
Isabel
to
*NL*
think
of
Madame
Merle
's
situation
as
aristocratic
--
a
view
of
it
never
*NL*
expressed
in
any
reference
made
to
it
by
that
lady
herself
.
She
had
*NL*
known
great
things
and
great
people
,
but
she
had
never
played
a
great
*NL*
part
.
She
was
one
of
the
small
ones
of
the
earth
;
she
had
not
been
born
*NL*
to
honours
;
she
knew
the
world
too
well
to
nourish
fatuous
illusions
*NL*
on
the
article
of
her
own
place
in
it
.
She
had
encountered
many
of
the
*NL*
fortunate
few
and
was
perfectly
aware
of
those
points
at
which
their
*NL*
fortune
differed
from
hers
.
But
if
by
her
informed
measure
she
was
no
*NL*
figure
for
a
high
scene
,
she
had
yet
to
Isabel
's
imagination
a
sort
of
*NL*
greatness
.
To
be
so
cultivated
and
civilised
,
so
wise
and
so
easy
,
*NL*
and
still
make
so
light
of
it
--
that
was
really
to
be
a
great
lady
,
*NL*
especially
when
one
so
carried
and
presented
one
's
self
.
It
was
as
if
*NL*
somehow
she
had
all
society
under
contribution
,
and
all
the
arts
and
*NL*
graces
it
practised
--
or
was
the
effect
rather
that
of
charming
uses
*NL*
found
for
her
,
even
from
a
distance
,
subtle
service
rendered
by
her
to
*NL*
a
clamorous
world
wherever
she
might
be
?
After
breakfast
she
wrote
a
*NL*
succession
of
letters
,
as
those
arriving
for
her
appeared
innumerable
:
*NL*
her
correspondence
was
a
source
of
surprise
to
Isabel
when
they
*NL*
sometimes
walked
together
to
the
village
post-office
to
deposit
Madame
*NL*
Merle
's
offering
to
the
mail
.
She
knew
more
people
,
as
she
told
Isabel
,
*NL*
than
she
knew
what
to
do
with
,
and
something
was
always
turning
up
to
be
*NL*
written
about
.
Of
painting
she
was
devotedly
fond
,
and
made
no
more
of
*NL*
brushing
in
a
sketch
than
of
pulling
off
her
gloves
.
At
Gardencourt
she
*NL*
was
perpetually
taking
advantage
of
an
hour
's
sunshine
to
go
out
with
a
*NL*
camp-stool
and
a
box
of
water-colours
.
That
she
was
a
brave
musician
we
*NL*
have
already
perceived
,
and
it
was
evidence
of
the
fact
that
when
she
*NL*
seated
herself
at
the
piano
,
as
she
always
did
in
the
evening
,
her
*NL*
listeners
resigned
themselves
without
a
murmur
to
losing
the
grace
*NL*
of
her
talk
.
Isabel
,
since
she
had
known
her
,
felt
ashamed
of
her
own
*NL*
facility
,
which
she
now
looked
upon
as
basely
inferior
;
and
indeed
,
*NL*
though
she
had
been
thought
rather
a
prodigy
at
home
,
the
loss
to
*NL*
society
when
,
in
taking
her
place
upon
the
music-stool
,
she
turned
her
*NL*
back
to
the
room
,
was
usually
deemed
greater
than
the
gain
.
When
Madame
*NL*
Merle
was
neither
writing
,
nor
painting
,
nor
touching
the
piano
,
she
*NL*
was
usually
employed
upon
wonderful
tasks
of
rich
embroidery
,
cushions
,
*NL*
curtains
,
decorations
for
the
chimneypiece
;
an
art
in
which
her
bold
,
*NL*
free
invention
was
as
noted
as
the
agility
of
her
needle
.
She
was
never
*NL*
idle
,
for
when
engaged
in
none
of
the
ways
I
have
mentioned
she
was
*NL*
either
reading
-LRB-
she
appeared
to
Isabel
to
read
``
everything
important
''
-RRB-
,
*NL*
or
walking
out
,
or
playing
patience
with
the
cards
,
or
talking
with
her
*NL*
fellow
inmates
.
And
with
all
this
she
had
always
the
social
quality
,
was
*NL*
never
rudely
absent
and
yet
never
too
seated
.
She
laid
down
her
pastimes
*NL*
as
easily
as
she
took
them
up
;
she
worked
and
talked
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
and
appeared
to
impute
scant
worth
to
anything
she
did
.
She
gave
away
*NL*
her
sketches
and
tapestries
;
she
rose
from
the
piano
or
remained
*NL*
there
,
according
to
the
convenience
of
her
auditors
,
which
she
always
*NL*
unerringly
divined
.
She
was
in
short
the
most
comfortable
,
profitable
,
*NL*
amenable
person
to
live
with
.
If
for
Isabel
she
had
a
fault
it
was
that
*NL*
she
was
not
natural
;
by
which
the
girl
meant
,
not
that
she
was
either
*NL*
affected
or
pretentious
,
since
from
these
vulgar
vices
no
woman
could
*NL*
have
been
more
exempt
,
but
that
her
nature
had
been
too
much
overlaid
by
*NL*
custom
and
her
angles
too
much
rubbed
away
.
She
had
become
too
flexible
,
*NL*
too
useful
,
was
too
ripe
and
too
final
.
She
was
in
a
word
too
perfectly
*NL*
the
social
animal
that
man
and
woman
are
supposed
to
have
been
intended
*NL*
to
be
;
and
she
had
rid
herself
of
every
remnant
of
that
tonic
wildness
*NL*
which
we
may
assume
to
have
belonged
even
to
the
most
amiable
persons
*NL*
in
the
ages
before
country-house
life
was
the
fashion
.
Isabel
found
it
*NL*
difficult
to
think
of
her
in
any
detachment
or
privacy
,
she
existed
only
*NL*
in
her
relations
,
direct
or
indirect
,
with
her
fellow
mortals
.
One
might
*NL*
wonder
what
commerce
she
could
possibly
hold
with
her
own
spirit
.
*NL*
One
always
ended
,
however
,
by
feeling
that
a
charming
surface
does
n't
*NL*
necessarily
prove
one
superficial
;
this
was
an
illusion
in
which
,
in
*NL*
one
's
youth
,
one
had
but
just
escaped
being
nourished
.
Madame
Merle
was
*NL*
not
superficial
--
not
she
.
She
was
deep
,
and
her
nature
spoke
none
the
*NL*
less
in
her
behaviour
because
it
spoke
a
conventional
tongue
.
``
What
's
*NL*
language
at
all
but
a
convention
?
''
said
Isabel
.
``
She
has
the
good
*NL*
taste
not
to
pretend
,
like
some
people
I
've
met
,
to
express
herself
by
*NL*
original
signs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
you
've
suffered
much
,
''
she
once
found
occasion
to
say
to
her
*NL*
friend
in
response
to
some
allusion
that
had
appeared
to
reach
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
think
that
?
''
Madame
Merle
asked
with
the
amused
smile
*NL*
of
a
person
seated
at
a
game
of
guesses
.
``
I
hope
I
have
n't
too
much
the
*NL*
droop
of
the
misunderstood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
you
sometimes
say
things
that
I
think
people
who
have
always
*NL*
been
happy
would
n't
have
found
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
always
been
happy
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
,
smiling
still
,
but
*NL*
with
a
mock
gravity
,
as
if
she
were
telling
a
child
a
secret
.
``
Such
a
*NL*
wonderful
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Isabel
rose
to
the
irony
.
``
A
great
many
people
give
me
the
*NL*
impression
of
never
having
for
a
moment
felt
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
true
;
there
are
many
more
iron
pots
certainly
than
porcelain
.
*NL*
But
you
may
depend
on
it
that
every
one
bears
some
mark
;
even
the
*NL*
hardest
iron
pots
have
a
little
bruise
,
a
little
hole
somewhere
.
I
*NL*
flatter
myself
that
I
'm
rather
stout
,
but
if
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
*NL*
I
've
been
shockingly
chipped
and
cracked
.
I
do
very
well
for
service
*NL*
yet
,
because
I
've
been
cleverly
mended
;
and
I
try
to
remain
in
the
*NL*
cupboard
--
the
quiet
,
dusky
cupboard
where
there
's
an
odour
of
stale
*NL*
spices
--
as
much
as
I
can
.
But
when
I
've
to
come
out
and
into
a
strong
*NL*
light
--
then
,
my
dear
,
I
'm
a
horror
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
not
whether
it
was
on
this
occasion
or
on
some
other
that
the
*NL*
conversation
had
taken
the
turn
I
have
just
indicated
she
said
to
Isabel
*NL*
that
she
would
some
day
a
tale
unfold
.
Isabel
assured
her
she
should
*NL*
delight
to
listen
to
one
,
and
reminded
her
more
than
once
of
this
*NL*
engagement
.
Madame
Merle
,
however
,
begged
repeatedly
for
a
respite
,
and
*NL*
at
last
frankly
told
her
young
companion
that
they
must
wait
till
they
*NL*
knew
each
other
better
.
This
would
be
sure
to
happen
,
a
long
friendship
*NL*
so
visibly
lay
before
them
.
Isabel
assented
,
but
at
the
same
time
*NL*
enquired
if
she
might
n't
be
trusted
--
if
she
appeared
capable
of
a
*NL*
betrayal
of
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
that
I
'm
afraid
of
your
repeating
what
I
say
,
''
her
fellow
*NL*
visitor
answered
;
``
I
'm
afraid
,
on
the
contrary
,
of
your
taking
it
too
*NL*
much
to
yourself
.
You
'd
judge
me
too
harshly
;
you
're
of
the
cruel
age
.
''
*NL*
She
preferred
for
the
present
to
talk
to
Isabel
of
Isabel
,
and
exhibited
*NL*
the
greatest
interest
in
our
heroine
's
history
,
sentiments
,
opinions
,
*NL*
prospects
.
She
made
her
chatter
and
listened
to
her
chatter
with
*NL*
infinite
good
nature
.
This
flattered
and
quickened
the
girl
,
who
was
*NL*
struck
with
all
the
distinguished
people
her
friend
had
known
and
with
*NL*
her
having
lived
,
as
Mrs.
Touchett
said
,
in
the
best
company
in
Europe
.
*NL*
Isabel
thought
the
better
of
herself
for
enjoying
the
favour
of
a
person
*NL*
who
had
so
large
a
field
of
comparison
;
and
it
was
perhaps
partly
to
*NL*
gratify
the
sense
of
profiting
by
comparison
that
she
often
appealed
to
*NL*
these
stores
of
reminiscence
.
Madame
Merle
had
been
a
dweller
in
many
*NL*
lands
and
had
social
ties
in
a
dozen
different
countries
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
pretend
to
be
educated
,
''
she
would
say
,
``
but
I
think
I
know
my
Europe
;
''
*NL*
and
she
spoke
one
day
of
going
to
Sweden
to
stay
with
an
old
friend
,
*NL*
and
another
of
proceeding
to
Malta
to
follow
up
a
new
acquaintance
.
With
*NL*
England
,
where
she
had
often
dwelt
,
she
was
thoroughly
familiar
,
and
*NL*
for
Isabel
's
benefit
threw
a
great
deal
of
light
upon
the
customs
of
*NL*
the
country
and
the
character
of
the
people
,
who
``
after
all
,
''
as
she
was
*NL*
fond
of
saying
,
were
the
most
convenient
in
the
world
to
live
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
think
it
strange
her
remaining
here
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
*NL*
when
Mr.
Touchett
's
passing
away
,
''
that
gentleman
's
wife
remarked
to
her
*NL*
niece
.
``
She
is
incapable
of
a
mistake
;
she
's
the
most
tactful
woman
I
*NL*
know
.
It
's
a
favour
to
me
that
she
stays
;
she
's
putting
off
a
lot
of
*NL*
visits
at
great
houses
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
,
who
never
forgot
that
when
*NL*
she
herself
was
in
England
her
social
value
sank
two
or
three
degrees
in
*NL*
the
scale
.
``
She
has
her
pick
of
places
;
she
's
not
in
want
of
a
shelter
.
*NL*
But
I
've
asked
her
to
put
in
this
time
because
I
wish
you
to
know
her
.
I
*NL*
think
it
will
be
a
good
thing
for
you
.
Serena
Merle
has
n't
a
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
did
n't
already
like
her
very
much
that
description
might
alarm
*NL*
me
,
''
Isabel
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
never
the
least
little
bit
`
off
.
'
I
've
brought
you
out
here
and
I
*NL*
wish
to
do
the
best
for
you
.
Your
sister
Lily
told
me
she
hoped
I
would
*NL*
give
you
plenty
of
opportunities
.
I
give
you
one
in
putting
you
in
*NL*
relation
with
Madame
Merle
.
She
's
one
of
the
most
brilliant
women
in
*NL*
Europe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
her
better
than
I
like
your
description
of
her
,
''
Isabel
*NL*
persisted
in
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
flatter
yourself
that
you
'll
ever
feel
her
open
to
criticism
?
I
*NL*
hope
you
'll
let
me
know
when
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
be
cruel
--
to
you
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
mind
me
.
You
wo
n't
discover
a
fault
in
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
.
But
I
dare
say
I
sha
n't
miss
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
knows
absolutely
everything
on
earth
there
is
to
know
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
after
this
observed
to
their
companion
that
she
hoped
she
knew
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
considered
she
had
n't
a
speck
on
her
perfection
.
On
which
*NL*
``
I
'm
obliged
to
you
,
''
Madame
Merle
replied
,
``
but
I
'm
afraid
your
aunt
*NL*
imagines
,
or
at
least
alludes
to
,
no
aberrations
that
the
clock-face
*NL*
does
n't
register
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
you
mean
you
've
a
wild
side
that
's
unknown
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
no
,
I
fear
my
darkest
sides
are
my
tamest
.
I
mean
that
having
no
*NL*
faults
,
for
your
aunt
,
means
that
one
's
never
late
for
dinner
--
that
is
*NL*
for
her
dinner
.
I
was
not
late
,
by
the
way
,
the
other
day
,
when
you
*NL*
came
back
from
London
;
the
clock
was
just
at
eight
when
I
came
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
:
it
was
the
rest
of
you
that
were
before
the
time
.
It
means
*NL*
that
one
answers
a
letter
the
day
one
gets
it
and
that
when
one
comes
to
*NL*
stay
with
her
one
does
n't
bring
too
much
luggage
and
is
careful
not
to
*NL*
be
taken
ill
.
For
Mrs.
Touchett
those
things
constitute
virtue
;
it
's
a
*NL*
blessing
to
be
able
to
reduce
it
to
its
elements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
's
own
conversation
,
it
will
be
perceived
,
was
enriched
with
*NL*
bold
,
free
touches
of
criticism
,
which
,
even
when
they
had
a
restrictive
*NL*
effect
,
never
struck
Isabel
as
ill-natured
.
It
could
n't
occur
to
the
*NL*
girl
for
instance
that
Mrs.
Touchett
's
accomplished
guest
was
abusing
*NL*
her
;
and
this
for
very
good
reasons
.
In
the
first
place
Isabel
rose
*NL*
eagerly
to
the
sense
of
her
shades
;
in
the
second
Madame
Merle
implied
*NL*
that
there
was
a
great
deal
more
to
say
;
and
it
was
clear
in
the
*NL*
third
that
for
a
person
to
speak
to
one
without
ceremony
of
one
's
near
*NL*
relations
was
an
agreeable
sign
of
that
person
's
intimacy
with
one
's
*NL*
self
.
These
signs
of
deep
communion
multiplied
as
the
days
elapsed
,
and
*NL*
there
was
none
of
which
Isabel
was
more
sensible
than
of
her
companion
's
*NL*
preference
for
making
Miss
Archer
herself
a
topic
.
Though
she
referred
*NL*
frequently
to
the
incidents
of
her
own
career
she
never
lingered
upon
*NL*
them
;
she
was
as
little
of
a
gross
egotist
as
she
was
of
a
flat
gossip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
old
and
stale
and
faded
,
''
she
said
more
than
once
;
``
I
'm
of
no
*NL*
more
interest
than
last
week
's
newspaper
.
You
're
young
and
fresh
and
of
*NL*
to-day
;
you
've
the
great
thing
--
you
've
actuality
.
I
once
had
it
--
we
all
*NL*
have
it
for
an
hour
.
You
,
however
,
will
have
it
for
longer
.
Let
us
talk
*NL*
about
you
then
;
you
can
say
nothing
I
shall
not
care
to
hear
.
It
's
a
*NL*
sign
that
I
'm
growing
old
--
that
I
like
to
talk
with
younger
people
.
I
*NL*
think
it
's
a
very
pretty
compensation
.
If
we
ca
n't
have
youth
within
us
*NL*
we
can
have
it
outside
,
and
I
really
think
we
see
it
and
feel
it
better
*NL*
that
way
.
Of
course
we
must
be
in
sympathy
with
it
--
that
I
shall
always
*NL*
be
.
I
do
n't
know
that
I
shall
ever
be
ill-natured
with
old
people
--
I
*NL*
hope
not
;
there
are
certainly
some
old
people
I
adore
.
But
I
shall
never
*NL*
be
anything
but
abject
with
the
young
;
they
touch
me
and
appeal
to
me
*NL*
too
much
.
I
give
you
carte
blanche
then
;
you
can
even
be
impertinent
if
*NL*
you
like
;
I
shall
let
it
pass
and
horribly
spoil
you
.
I
speak
as
if
I
*NL*
were
a
hundred
years
old
,
you
say
?
Well
,
I
am
,
if
you
please
;
I
was
born
*NL*
before
the
French
Revolution
.
Ah
,
my
dear
,
je
viens
de
loin
;
I
belong
to
*NL*
the
old
,
old
world
.
But
it
's
not
of
that
I
want
to
talk
;
I
want
to
talk
*NL*
about
the
new
.
You
must
tell
me
more
about
America
;
you
never
tell
me
*NL*
enough
.
Here
I
've
been
since
I
was
brought
here
as
a
helpless
child
,
and
*NL*
it
's
ridiculous
,
or
rather
it
's
scandalous
,
how
little
I
know
about
that
*NL*
splendid
,
dreadful
,
funny
country
--
surely
the
greatest
and
drollest
of
*NL*
them
all
.
There
are
a
great
many
of
us
like
that
in
these
parts
,
and
I
*NL*
must
say
I
think
we
're
a
wretched
set
of
people
.
You
should
live
in
your
*NL*
own
land
;
whatever
it
may
be
you
have
your
natural
place
there
.
If
we
're
*NL*
not
good
Americans
we
're
certainly
poor
Europeans
;
we
've
no
natural
*NL*
place
here
.
We
're
mere
parasites
,
crawling
over
the
surface
;
we
have
n't
*NL*
our
feet
in
the
soil
.
At
least
one
can
know
it
and
not
have
illusions
.
A
*NL*
woman
perhaps
can
get
on
;
a
woman
,
it
seems
to
me
,
has
no
natural
place
*NL*
anywhere
;
wherever
she
finds
herself
she
has
to
remain
on
the
surface
*NL*
and
,
more
or
less
,
to
crawl
.
You
protest
,
my
dear
?
you
're
horrified
?
*NL*
you
declare
you
'll
never
crawl
?
It
's
very
true
that
I
do
n't
see
you
*NL*
crawling
;
you
stand
more
upright
than
a
good
many
poor
creatures
.
*NL*
Very
good
;
on
the
whole
,
I
do
n't
think
you
'll
crawl
.
But
the
men
,
the
*NL*
Americans
;
je
vous
demande
un
peu
,
what
do
they
make
of
it
over
here
?
*NL*
I
do
n't
envy
them
trying
to
arrange
themselves
.
Look
at
poor
Ralph
*NL*
Touchett
:
what
sort
of
a
figure
do
you
call
that
?
Fortunately
he
has
a
*NL*
consumption
;
I
say
fortunately
,
because
it
gives
him
something
to
do
.
*NL*
His
consumption
's
his
carriere
it
's
a
kind
of
position
.
You
can
say
:
*NL*
`
Oh
,
Mr.
Touchett
,
he
takes
care
of
his
lungs
,
he
knows
a
great
deal
*NL*
about
climates
.
'
But
without
that
who
would
he
be
,
what
would
he
*NL*
represent
?
`
Mr.
Ralph
Touchett
:
an
American
who
lives
in
Europe
.
'
That
*NL*
signifies
absolutely
nothing
--
it
's
impossible
anything
should
signify
*NL*
less
.
`
He
's
very
cultivated
,
'
they
say
:
`
he
has
a
very
pretty
collection
*NL*
of
old
snuff-boxes
.
'
The
collection
is
all
that
's
wanted
to
make
it
*NL*
pitiful
.
I
'm
tired
of
the
sound
of
the
word
;
I
think
it
's
grotesque
.
*NL*
With
the
poor
old
father
it
's
different
;
he
has
his
identity
,
and
it
's
*NL*
rather
a
massive
one
.
He
represents
a
great
financial
house
,
and
that
,
*NL*
in
our
day
,
is
as
good
as
anything
else
.
For
an
American
,
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
that
will
do
very
well
.
But
I
persist
in
thinking
your
cousin
very
lucky
*NL*
to
have
a
chronic
malady
so
long
as
he
does
n't
die
of
it
.
It
's
much
*NL*
better
than
the
snuffboxes
.
If
he
were
n't
ill
,
you
say
,
he
'd
do
*NL*
something
?
--
he
'd
take
his
father
's
place
in
the
house
.
My
poor
child
,
I
*NL*
doubt
it
;
I
do
n't
think
he
's
at
all
fond
of
the
house
.
However
,
you
know
*NL*
him
better
than
I
,
though
I
used
to
know
him
rather
well
,
and
he
may
*NL*
have
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
.
The
worst
case
,
I
think
,
is
a
friend
*NL*
of
mine
,
a
countryman
of
ours
,
who
lives
in
Italy
-LRB-
where
he
also
was
*NL*
brought
before
he
knew
better
-RRB-
,
and
who
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
*NL*
men
I
know
.
Some
day
you
must
know
him
.
I
'll
bring
you
together
and
then
*NL*
you
'll
see
what
I
mean
.
He
's
Gilbert
Osmond
--
he
lives
in
Italy
;
that
's
*NL*
all
one
can
say
about
him
or
make
of
him
.
He
's
exceedingly
clever
,
a
*NL*
man
made
to
be
distinguished
;
but
,
as
I
tell
you
,
you
exhaust
the
*NL*
description
when
you
say
he
's
Mr.
Osmond
who
lives
tout
betement
in
*NL*
Italy
.
No
career
,
no
name
,
no
position
,
no
fortune
,
no
past
,
no
future
,
*NL*
no
anything
.
Oh
yes
,
he
paints
,
if
you
please
--
paints
in
water-colours
;
*NL*
like
me
,
only
better
than
I.
His
painting
's
pretty
bad
;
on
the
whole
I
'm
*NL*
rather
glad
of
that
.
Fortunately
he
's
very
indolent
,
so
indolent
that
*NL*
it
amounts
to
a
sort
of
position
.
He
can
say
,
`
Oh
,
I
do
nothing
;
I
'm
too
*NL*
deadly
lazy
.
You
can
do
nothing
to-day
unless
you
get
up
at
five
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
'
In
that
way
he
becomes
a
sort
of
exception
;
you
feel
*NL*
he
might
do
something
if
he
'd
only
rise
early
.
He
never
speaks
of
his
*NL*
painting
to
people
at
large
;
he
's
too
clever
for
that
.
But
he
has
a
*NL*
little
girl
--
a
dear
little
girl
;
he
does
speak
of
her
.
He
's
devoted
*NL*
to
her
,
and
if
it
were
a
career
to
be
an
excellent
father
he
'd
be
very
*NL*
distinguished
.
But
I
'm
afraid
that
's
no
better
than
the
snuff-boxes
;
*NL*
perhaps
not
even
so
good
.
Tell
me
what
they
do
in
America
,
''
pursued
*NL*
Madame
Merle
,
who
,
it
must
be
observed
parenthetically
,
did
not
deliver
*NL*
herself
all
at
once
of
these
reflexions
,
which
are
presented
in
a
*NL*
cluster
for
the
convenience
of
the
reader
.
She
talked
of
Florence
,
where
*NL*
Mr.
Osmond
lived
and
where
Mrs.
Touchett
occupied
a
medieval
palace
;
she
*NL*
talked
of
Rome
,
where
she
herself
had
a
little
pied-a-terre
with
some
*NL*
rather
good
old
damask
.
She
talked
of
places
,
of
people
and
even
,
as
the
*NL*
phrase
is
,
of
``
subjects
''
;
and
from
time
to
time
she
talked
of
their
kind
*NL*
old
host
and
of
the
prospect
of
his
recovery
.
From
the
first
she
*NL*
had
thought
this
prospect
small
,
and
Isabel
had
been
struck
with
the
*NL*
positive
,
discriminating
,
competent
way
in
which
she
took
the
measure
*NL*
of
his
remainder
of
life
.
One
evening
she
announced
definitely
that
he
*NL*
would
n't
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Matthew
Hope
told
me
so
as
plainly
as
was
proper
,
''
she
said
;
*NL*
``
standing
there
,
near
the
fire
,
before
dinner
.
He
makes
himself
very
*NL*
agreeable
,
the
great
doctor
.
I
do
n't
mean
his
saying
that
has
anything
*NL*
to
do
with
it
.
But
he
says
such
things
with
great
tact
.
I
had
told
him
*NL*
I
felt
ill
at
my
ease
,
staying
here
at
such
a
time
;
it
seemed
to
me
so
*NL*
indiscreet
--
it
was
n't
as
if
I
could
nurse
.
`
You
must
remain
,
you
must
*NL*
remain
,
'
he
answered
;
`
your
office
will
come
later
.
'
Was
n't
that
a
very
*NL*
delicate
way
of
saying
both
that
poor
Mr.
Touchett
would
go
and
that
I
*NL*
might
be
of
some
use
as
a
consoler
?
In
fact
,
however
,
I
shall
not
be
of
*NL*
the
slightest
use
.
Your
aunt
will
console
herself
;
she
,
and
she
alone
,
*NL*
knows
just
how
much
consolation
she
'll
require
.
It
would
be
a
very
*NL*
delicate
matter
for
another
person
to
undertake
to
administer
the
dose
.
*NL*
With
your
cousin
it
will
be
different
;
he
'll
miss
his
father
immensely
.
*NL*
But
I
should
never
presume
to
condole
with
Mr.
Ralph
;
we
're
not
on
*NL*
those
terms
.
''
Madame
Merle
had
alluded
more
than
once
to
some
undefined
*NL*
incongruity
in
her
relations
with
Ralph
Touchett
;
so
Isabel
took
this
*NL*
occasion
of
asking
her
if
they
were
not
good
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
,
but
he
does
n't
like
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
whatever
.
But
one
has
no
need
of
a
reason
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
not
liking
you
?
I
think
one
has
need
of
a
very
good
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
kind
.
Be
sure
you
have
one
ready
for
the
day
you
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begin
to
dislike
you
?
I
shall
never
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
;
because
if
you
do
you
'll
never
end
.
That
's
the
way
with
*NL*
your
cousin
;
he
does
n't
get
over
it
.
It
's
an
antipathy
of
nature
--
if
*NL*
I
can
call
it
that
when
it
's
all
on
his
side
.
I
've
nothing
whatever
*NL*
against
him
and
do
n't
bear
him
the
least
little
grudge
for
not
doing
me
*NL*
justice
.
Justice
is
all
I
want
.
However
,
one
feels
that
he
's
a
gentleman
*NL*
and
would
never
say
anything
underhand
about
one
.
Cartes
sur
table
,
''
*NL*
Madame
Merle
subjoined
in
a
moment
,
``
I
'm
not
afraid
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
indeed
,
''
said
Isabel
,
who
added
something
about
his
being
*NL*
the
kindest
creature
living
.
She
remembered
,
however
,
that
on
her
first
*NL*
asking
him
about
Madame
Merle
he
had
answered
her
in
a
manner
which
*NL*
this
lady
might
have
thought
injurious
without
being
explicit
.
There
*NL*
was
something
between
them
,
Isabel
said
to
herself
,
but
she
said
nothing
*NL*
more
than
this
.
If
it
were
something
of
importance
it
should
inspire
*NL*
respect
;
if
it
were
not
it
was
not
worth
her
curiosity
.
With
all
her
*NL*
love
of
knowledge
she
had
a
natural
shrinking
from
raising
curtains
and
*NL*
looking
into
unlighted
corners
.
The
love
of
knowledge
coexisted
in
her
*NL*
mind
with
the
finest
capacity
for
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Madame
Merle
sometimes
said
things
that
startled
her
,
made
her
raise
*NL*
her
clear
eyebrows
at
the
time
and
think
of
the
words
afterwards
.
``
I
'd
*NL*
give
a
great
deal
to
be
your
age
again
,
''
she
broke
out
once
with
a
*NL*
bitterness
which
,
though
diluted
in
her
customary
amplitude
of
ease
,
was
*NL*
imperfectly
disguised
by
it
.
``
If
I
could
only
begin
again
--
if
I
could
*NL*
have
my
life
before
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
life
's
before
you
yet
,
''
Isabel
answered
gently
,
for
she
was
*NL*
vaguely
awe-struck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
the
best
part
's
gone
,
and
gone
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
not
for
nothing
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
--
what
have
I
got
?
Neither
husband
,
nor
child
,
nor
fortune
,
nor
*NL*
position
,
nor
the
traces
of
a
beauty
that
I
never
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
many
friends
,
dear
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
so
sure
!
''
cried
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
're
wrong
.
You
have
memories
,
graces
,
talents
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Madame
Merle
interrupted
her
.
``
What
have
my
talents
brought
me
?
*NL*
Nothing
but
the
need
of
using
them
still
,
to
get
through
the
hours
,
*NL*
the
years
,
to
cheat
myself
with
some
pretence
of
movement
,
of
*NL*
unconsciousness
.
As
for
my
graces
and
memories
the
less
said
about
them
*NL*
the
better
.
You
'll
be
my
friend
till
you
find
a
better
use
for
your
*NL*
friendship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
for
you
to
see
that
I
do
n't
then
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
would
make
an
effort
to
keep
you
.
''
And
her
companion
looked
at
*NL*
her
gravely
.
``
When
I
say
I
should
like
to
be
your
age
I
mean
with
your
*NL*
qualities
--
frank
,
generous
,
sincere
like
you
.
In
that
case
I
should
have
*NL*
made
something
better
of
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
you
have
liked
to
do
that
you
've
not
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
took
a
sheet
of
music
--
she
was
seated
at
the
piano
and
*NL*
had
abruptly
wheeled
about
on
the
stool
when
she
first
spoke
--
and
*NL*
mechanically
turned
the
leaves
.
``
I
'm
very
ambitious
!
''
she
at
last
*NL*
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
ambitions
have
not
been
satisfied
?
They
must
have
been
great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
WERE
great
.
I
should
make
myself
ridiculous
by
talking
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
wondered
what
they
could
have
been
--
whether
Madame
Merle
had
*NL*
aspired
to
wear
a
crown
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
your
idea
of
success
may
be
,
*NL*
but
you
seem
to
me
to
have
been
successful
.
To
me
indeed
you
're
a
vivid
*NL*
image
of
success
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
tossed
away
the
music
with
a
smile
.
``
What
's
YOUR
idea
of
*NL*
success
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
evidently
think
it
must
be
a
very
tame
one
.
It
's
to
see
some
dream
*NL*
of
one
's
youth
come
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
Madame
Merle
exclaimed
,
``
that
I
've
never
seen
!
But
my
dreams
were
*NL*
so
great
--
so
preposterous
.
Heaven
forgive
me
,
I
'm
dreaming
now
!
''
And
she
*NL*
turned
back
to
the
piano
and
began
grandly
to
play
.
On
the
morrow
she
*NL*
said
to
Isabel
that
her
definition
of
success
had
been
very
pretty
,
*NL*
yet
frightfully
sad
.
Measured
in
that
way
,
who
had
ever
succeeded
?
The
*NL*
dreams
of
one
's
youth
,
why
they
were
enchanting
,
they
were
divine
!
Who
*NL*
had
ever
seen
such
things
come
to
pass
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
myself
--
a
few
of
them
,
''
Isabel
ventured
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Already
?
They
must
have
been
dreams
of
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
began
to
dream
very
young
,
''
Isabel
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
if
you
mean
the
aspirations
of
your
childhood
--
that
of
having
a
*NL*
pink
sash
and
a
doll
that
could
close
her
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
mean
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
a
young
man
with
a
fine
moustache
going
down
on
his
knees
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
nor
that
either
,
''
Isabel
declared
with
still
more
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
appeared
to
note
this
eagerness
.
``
I
suspect
that
's
what
*NL*
you
do
mean
.
We
've
all
had
the
young
man
with
the
moustache
.
He
's
the
*NL*
inevitable
young
man
;
he
does
n't
count
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
silent
a
little
but
then
spoke
with
extreme
and
*NL*
characteristic
inconsequence
.
``
Why
should
n't
he
count
?
There
are
young
*NL*
men
and
young
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yours
was
a
paragon
--
is
that
what
you
mean
?
''
asked
her
friend
with
*NL*
a
laugh
.
``
If
you
've
had
the
identical
young
man
you
dreamed
of
,
then
*NL*
that
was
success
,
and
I
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
.
Only
in
that
*NL*
case
why
did
n't
you
fly
with
him
to
his
castle
in
the
Apennines
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
no
castle
in
the
Apennines
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
he
?
An
ugly
brick
house
in
Fortieth
Street
?
Do
n't
tell
me
*NL*
that
;
I
refuse
to
recognise
that
as
an
ideal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
anything
about
his
house
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
crude
of
you
.
When
you
've
lived
as
long
as
I
you
'll
see
*NL*
that
every
human
being
has
his
shell
and
that
you
must
take
the
shell
*NL*
into
account
.
By
the
shell
I
mean
the
whole
envelope
of
circumstances
.
*NL*
There
's
no
such
thing
as
an
isolated
man
or
woman
;
we
're
each
of
us
*NL*
made
up
of
some
cluster
of
appurtenances
.
What
shall
we
call
our
`
self
'
?
*NL*
Where
does
it
begin
?
where
does
it
end
?
It
overflows
into
everything
*NL*
that
belongs
to
us
--
and
then
it
flows
back
again
.
I
know
a
large
part
*NL*
of
myself
is
in
the
clothes
I
choose
to
wear
.
I
've
a
great
respect
for
*NL*
THINGS
!
One
's
self
--
for
other
people
--
is
one
's
expression
of
one
's
self
;
*NL*
and
one
's
house
,
one
's
furniture
,
one
's
garments
,
the
books
one
reads
,
*NL*
the
company
one
keeps
--
these
things
are
all
expressive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
very
metaphysical
;
not
more
so
,
however
,
than
several
*NL*
observations
Madame
Merle
had
already
made
.
Isabel
was
fond
of
*NL*
metaphysics
,
but
was
unable
to
accompany
her
friend
into
this
bold
*NL*
analysis
of
the
human
personality
.
``
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
.
I
think
just
*NL*
the
other
way
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
succeed
in
expressing
myself
,
but
*NL*
I
know
that
nothing
else
expresses
me
.
Nothing
that
belongs
to
me
is
any
*NL*
measure
of
me
;
everything
's
on
the
contrary
a
limit
,
a
barrier
,
and
*NL*
a
perfectly
arbitrary
one
.
Certainly
the
clothes
which
,
as
you
say
,
I
*NL*
choose
to
wear
,
do
n't
express
me
;
and
heaven
forbid
they
should
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
dress
very
well
,
''
Madame
Merle
lightly
interposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
;
but
I
do
n't
care
to
be
judged
by
that
.
My
clothes
may
express
*NL*
the
dressmaker
,
but
they
do
n't
express
me
.
To
begin
with
it
's
not
my
own
*NL*
choice
that
I
wear
them
;
they
're
imposed
upon
me
by
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
prefer
to
go
without
them
?
''
Madame
Merle
enquired
in
a
tone
*NL*
which
virtually
terminated
the
discussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
bound
to
confess
,
though
it
may
cast
some
discredit
on
the
sketch
I
*NL*
have
given
of
the
youthful
loyalty
practised
by
our
heroine
toward
this
*NL*
accomplished
woman
,
that
Isabel
had
said
nothing
whatever
to
her
about
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
and
had
been
equally
reticent
on
the
subject
of
Caspar
*NL*
Goodwood
.
She
had
not
,
however
,
concealed
the
fact
that
she
had
had
*NL*
opportunities
of
marrying
and
had
even
let
her
friend
know
of
how
*NL*
advantageous
a
kind
they
had
been
.
Lord
Warburton
had
left
Lockleigh
*NL*
and
was
gone
to
Scotland
,
taking
his
sisters
with
him
;
and
though
he
had
*NL*
written
to
Ralph
more
than
once
to
ask
about
Mr.
Touchett
's
health
the
*NL*
girl
was
not
liable
to
the
embarrassment
of
such
enquiries
as
,
had
he
*NL*
still
been
in
the
neighbourhood
,
he
would
probably
have
felt
bound
to
*NL*
make
in
person
.
He
had
excellent
ways
,
but
she
felt
sure
that
if
he
had
*NL*
come
to
Gardencourt
he
would
have
seen
Madame
Merle
,
and
that
if
he
had
*NL*
seen
her
he
would
have
liked
her
and
betrayed
to
her
that
he
was
in
love
*NL*
with
her
young
friend
.
It
so
happened
that
during
this
lady
's
previous
*NL*
visits
to
Gardencourt
--
each
of
them
much
shorter
than
the
present
--
he
*NL*
had
either
not
been
at
Lockleigh
or
had
not
called
at
Mr.
Touchett
's
.
*NL*
Therefore
,
though
she
knew
him
by
name
as
the
great
man
of
that
*NL*
county
,
she
had
no
cause
to
suspect
him
as
a
suitor
of
Mrs.
Touchett
's
*NL*
freshly-imported
niece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
plenty
of
time
,
''
she
had
said
to
Isabel
in
return
for
the
*NL*
mutilated
confidences
which
our
young
woman
made
her
and
which
did
n't
*NL*
pretend
to
be
perfect
,
though
we
have
seen
that
at
moments
the
girl
*NL*
had
compunctions
at
having
said
so
much
.
``
I
'm
glad
you
've
done
nothing
*NL*
yet
--
that
you
have
it
still
to
do
.
It
's
a
very
good
thing
for
a
girl
to
*NL*
have
refused
a
few
good
offers
--
so
long
of
course
as
they
are
not
the
*NL*
best
she
's
likely
to
have
.
Pardon
me
if
my
tone
seems
horribly
corrupt
;
*NL*
one
must
take
the
worldly
view
sometimes
.
Only
do
n't
keep
on
refusing
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
refusing
.
It
's
a
pleasant
exercise
of
power
;
but
*NL*
accepting
's
after
all
an
exercise
of
power
as
well
.
There
's
always
the
*NL*
danger
of
refusing
once
too
often
.
It
was
not
the
one
I
fell
into
--
I
*NL*
did
n't
refuse
often
enough
.
You
're
an
exquisite
creature
,
and
I
should
*NL*
like
to
see
you
married
to
a
prime
minister
.
But
speaking
strictly
,
you
*NL*
know
,
you
're
not
what
is
technically
called
a
parti
.
You
're
extremely
*NL*
good-looking
and
extremely
clever
;
in
yourself
you
're
quite
exceptional
.
*NL*
You
appear
to
have
the
vaguest
ideas
about
your
earthly
possessions
;
but
*NL*
from
what
I
can
make
out
you
're
not
embarrassed
with
an
income
.
I
wish
*NL*
you
had
a
little
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
had
!
''
said
Isabel
,
simply
,
apparently
forgetting
for
the
*NL*
moment
that
her
poverty
had
been
a
venial
fault
for
two
gallant
*NL*
gentlemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
Sir
Matthew
Hope
's
benevolent
recommendation
Madame
Merle
*NL*
did
not
remain
to
the
end
,
as
the
issue
of
poor
Mr.
Touchett
's
malady
*NL*
had
now
come
frankly
to
be
designated
.
She
was
under
pledges
to
other
*NL*
people
which
had
at
last
to
be
redeemed
,
and
she
left
Gardencourt
with
*NL*
the
understanding
that
she
should
in
any
event
see
Mrs.
Touchett
there
*NL*
again
,
or
else
in
town
,
before
quitting
England
.
Her
parting
with
Isabel
*NL*
was
even
more
like
the
beginning
of
a
friendship
than
their
meeting
had
*NL*
been
.
``
I
'm
going
to
six
places
in
succession
,
but
I
shall
see
no
one
I
*NL*
like
so
well
as
you
.
They
'll
all
be
old
friends
,
however
;
one
does
n't
*NL*
make
new
friends
at
my
age
.
I
've
made
a
great
exception
for
you
.
You
*NL*
must
remember
that
and
must
think
as
well
of
me
as
possible
.
You
must
*NL*
reward
me
by
believing
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
way
of
answer
Isabel
kissed
her
,
and
,
though
some
women
kiss
with
*NL*
facility
,
there
are
kisses
and
kisses
,
and
this
embrace
was
satisfactory
*NL*
to
Madame
Merle
.
Our
young
lady
,
after
this
,
was
much
alone
;
she
saw
her
*NL*
aunt
and
cousin
only
at
meals
,
and
discovered
that
of
the
hours
during
*NL*
which
Mrs.
Touchett
was
invisible
only
a
minor
portion
was
now
devoted
*NL*
to
nursing
her
husband
.
She
spent
the
rest
in
her
own
apartments
,
to
*NL*
which
access
was
not
allowed
even
to
her
niece
,
apparently
occupied
*NL*
there
with
mysterious
and
inscrutable
exercises
.
At
table
she
was
grave
*NL*
and
silent
;
but
her
solemnity
was
not
an
attitude
--
Isabel
could
see
it
*NL*
was
a
conviction
.
She
wondered
if
her
aunt
repented
of
having
taken
her
*NL*
own
way
so
much
;
but
there
was
no
visible
evidence
of
this
--
no
tears
,
no
*NL*
sighs
,
no
exaggeration
of
a
zeal
always
to
its
own
sense
adequate
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
seemed
simply
to
feel
the
need
of
thinking
things
over
and
*NL*
summing
them
up
;
she
had
a
little
moral
account-book
--
with
columns
*NL*
unerringly
ruled
and
a
sharp
steel
clasp
--
which
she
kept
with
exemplary
*NL*
neatness
.
Uttered
reflection
had
with
her
ever
,
at
any
rate
,
a
practical
*NL*
ring
.
``
If
I
had
foreseen
this
I
'd
not
have
proposed
your
coming
abroad
*NL*
now
,
''
she
said
to
Isabel
after
Madame
Merle
had
left
the
house
.
``
I
'd
*NL*
have
waited
and
sent
for
you
next
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
perhaps
I
should
never
have
known
my
uncle
?
It
's
a
great
*NL*
happiness
to
me
to
have
come
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
well
.
But
it
was
not
that
you
might
know
your
uncle
that
*NL*
I
brought
you
to
Europe
.
''
A
perfectly
veracious
speech
;
but
,
as
Isabel
*NL*
thought
,
not
as
perfectly
timed
.
She
had
leisure
to
think
of
this
and
*NL*
other
matters
.
She
took
a
solitary
walk
every
day
and
spent
vague
hours
*NL*
in
turning
over
books
in
the
library
.
Among
the
subjects
that
engaged
*NL*
her
attention
were
the
adventures
of
her
friend
Miss
Stackpole
,
with
*NL*
whom
she
was
in
regular
correspondence
.
Isabel
liked
her
friend
's
*NL*
private
epistolary
style
better
than
her
public
;
that
is
she
felt
her
*NL*
public
letters
would
have
been
excellent
if
they
had
not
been
printed
.
*NL*
Henrietta
's
career
,
however
,
was
not
so
successful
as
might
have
been
*NL*
wished
even
in
the
interest
of
her
private
felicity
;
that
view
of
the
*NL*
inner
life
of
Great
Britain
which
she
was
so
eager
to
take
appeared
to
*NL*
dance
before
her
like
an
ignis
fatuus
.
The
invitation
from
Lady
Pensil
,
*NL*
for
mysterious
reasons
,
had
never
arrived
;
and
poor
Mr.
Bantling
*NL*
himself
,
with
all
his
friendly
ingenuity
,
had
been
unable
to
explain
*NL*
so
grave
a
dereliction
on
the
part
of
a
missive
that
had
obviously
been
*NL*
sent
.
He
had
evidently
taken
Henrietta
's
affairs
much
to
heart
,
*NL*
and
believed
that
he
owed
her
a
set-off
to
this
illusory
visit
to
*NL*
Bedfordshire
.
``
He
says
he
should
think
I
would
go
to
the
Continent
,
''
*NL*
Henrietta
wrote
;
``
and
as
he
thinks
of
going
there
himself
I
suppose
his
*NL*
advice
is
sincere
.
He
wants
to
know
why
I
do
n't
take
a
view
of
French
*NL*
life
;
and
it
's
a
fact
that
I
want
very
much
to
see
the
new
Republic
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bantling
does
n't
care
much
about
the
Republic
,
but
he
thinks
of
going
*NL*
over
to
Paris
anyway
.
I
must
say
he
's
quite
as
attentive
as
I
could
*NL*
wish
,
and
at
least
I
shall
have
seen
one
polite
Englishman
.
I
keep
*NL*
telling
Mr.
Bantling
that
he
ought
to
have
been
an
American
,
and
you
*NL*
should
see
how
that
pleases
him
.
Whenever
I
say
so
he
always
breaks
out
*NL*
with
the
same
exclamation
--
`
Ah
,
but
really
,
come
now
!
''
A
few
days
later
*NL*
she
wrote
that
she
had
decided
to
go
to
Paris
at
the
end
of
the
week
and
*NL*
that
Mr.
Bantling
had
promised
to
see
her
off
--
perhaps
even
would
go
*NL*
as
far
as
Dover
with
her
.
She
would
wait
in
Paris
till
Isabel
should
*NL*
arrive
,
Henrietta
added
;
speaking
quite
as
if
Isabel
were
to
start
on
*NL*
her
continental
journey
alone
and
making
no
allusion
to
Mrs.
Touchett
.
*NL*
Bearing
in
mind
his
interest
in
their
late
companion
,
our
heroine
*NL*
communicated
several
passages
from
this
correspondence
to
Ralph
,
*NL*
who
followed
with
an
emotion
akin
to
suspense
the
career
of
the
*NL*
representative
of
the
Interviewer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
she
's
doing
very
well
,
''
he
said
,
``
going
over
to
Paris
*NL*
with
an
ex-Lancer
!
If
she
wants
something
to
write
about
she
has
only
to
*NL*
describe
that
episode
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
conventional
,
certainly
,
''
Isabel
answered
;
``
but
if
you
mean
*NL*
that
--
as
far
as
Henrietta
is
concerned
--
it
's
not
perfectly
innocent
,
*NL*
you
're
very
much
mistaken
.
You
'll
never
understand
Henrietta
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
I
understand
her
perfectly
.
I
did
n't
at
all
at
first
,
but
*NL*
now
I
've
the
point
of
view
.
I
'm
afraid
,
however
,
that
Bantling
has
n't
;
*NL*
he
may
have
some
surprises
.
Oh
,
I
understand
Henrietta
as
well
as
if
I
*NL*
had
made
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
by
no
means
sure
of
this
,
but
she
abstained
from
expressing
*NL*
further
doubt
,
for
she
was
disposed
in
these
days
to
extend
a
great
*NL*
charity
to
her
cousin
.
One
afternoon
less
than
a
week
after
Madame
*NL*
Merle
's
departure
she
was
seated
in
the
library
with
a
volume
to
*NL*
which
her
attention
was
not
fastened
.
She
had
placed
herself
in
a
deep
*NL*
window-bench
,
from
which
she
looked
out
into
the
dull
,
damp
park
;
and
as
*NL*
the
library
stood
at
right
angles
to
the
entrance-front
of
the
house
she
*NL*
could
see
the
doctor
's
brougham
,
which
had
been
waiting
for
the
last
two
*NL*
hours
before
the
door
.
She
was
struck
with
his
remaining
so
long
,
but
at
*NL*
last
she
saw
him
appear
in
the
portico
,
stand
a
moment
slowly
drawing
on
*NL*
his
gloves
and
looking
at
the
knees
of
his
horse
,
and
then
get
into
the
*NL*
vehicle
and
roll
away
.
Isabel
kept
her
place
for
half
an
hour
;
there
was
*NL*
a
great
stillness
in
the
house
.
It
was
so
great
that
when
she
at
last
*NL*
heard
a
soft
,
slow
step
on
the
deep
carpet
of
the
room
she
was
almost
*NL*
startled
by
the
sound
.
She
turned
quickly
away
from
the
window
and
saw
*NL*
Ralph
Touchett
standing
there
with
his
hands
still
in
his
pockets
,
but
*NL*
with
a
face
absolutely
void
of
its
usual
latent
smile
.
She
got
up
and
*NL*
her
movement
and
glance
were
a
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
over
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
that
my
uncle
...
?
''
And
Isabel
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
father
died
an
hour
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
poor
Ralph
!
''
she
gently
wailed
,
putting
out
her
two
hands
to
*NL*
him
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
Some
fortnight
after
this
Madame
Merle
drove
up
in
a
hansom
cab
to
*NL*
the
house
in
Winchester
Square
.
As
she
descended
from
her
vehicle
she
*NL*
observed
,
suspended
between
the
dining-room
windows
,
a
large
,
neat
,
*NL*
wooden
tablet
,
on
whose
fresh
black
ground
were
inscribed
in
white
paint
*NL*
the
words
--
``
This
noble
freehold
mansion
to
be
sold
''
;
with
the
name
of
*NL*
the
agent
to
whom
application
should
be
made
.
``
They
certainly
lose
no
*NL*
time
,
''
said
the
visitor
as
,
after
sounding
the
big
brass
knocker
,
she
*NL*
waited
to
be
admitted
;
``
it
's
a
practical
country
!
''
And
within
the
house
,
*NL*
as
she
ascended
to
the
drawing-room
,
she
perceived
numerous
signs
of
*NL*
abdication
;
pictures
removed
from
the
walls
and
placed
upon
sofas
,
*NL*
windows
undraped
and
floors
laid
bare
.
Mrs.
Touchett
presently
received
*NL*
her
and
intimated
in
a
few
words
that
condolences
might
be
taken
for
*NL*
granted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
you
're
going
to
say
--
he
was
a
very
good
man
.
But
I
know
it
*NL*
better
than
any
one
,
because
I
gave
him
more
chance
to
show
it
.
In
that
*NL*
I
think
I
was
a
good
wife
.
''
Mrs.
Touchett
added
that
at
the
end
her
*NL*
husband
apparently
recognised
this
fact
.
``
He
has
treated
me
most
*NL*
liberally
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
wo
n't
say
more
liberally
than
I
expected
,
*NL*
because
I
did
n't
expect
.
You
know
that
as
a
general
thing
I
do
n't
*NL*
expect
.
But
he
chose
,
I
presume
,
to
recognise
the
fact
that
though
I
*NL*
lived
much
abroad
and
mingled
--
you
may
say
freely
--
in
foreign
life
,
I
*NL*
never
exhibited
the
smallest
preference
for
any
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
any
one
but
yourself
,
''
Madame
Merle
mentally
observed
;
but
the
*NL*
reflexion
was
perfectly
inaudible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
sacrificed
my
husband
to
another
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
continued
with
*NL*
her
stout
curtness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
''
thought
Madame
Merle
;
``
you
never
did
anything
for
another
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
certain
cynicism
in
these
mute
comments
which
demands
an
*NL*
explanation
;
the
more
so
as
they
are
not
in
accord
either
with
the
*NL*
view
--
somewhat
superficial
perhaps
--
that
we
have
hitherto
enjoyed
of
*NL*
Madame
Merle
's
character
or
with
the
literal
facts
of
Mrs.
Touchett
's
*NL*
history
;
the
more
so
,
too
,
as
Madame
Merle
had
a
well-founded
conviction
*NL*
that
her
friend
's
last
remark
was
not
in
the
least
to
be
construed
as
a
*NL*
side-thrust
at
herself
.
The
truth
is
that
the
moment
she
had
crossed
the
*NL*
threshold
she
received
an
impression
that
Mr.
Touchett
's
death
had
had
*NL*
subtle
consequences
and
that
these
consequences
had
been
profitable
to
*NL*
a
little
circle
of
persons
among
whom
she
was
not
numbered
.
Of
course
*NL*
it
was
an
event
which
would
naturally
have
consequences
;
her
imagination
*NL*
had
more
than
once
rested
upon
this
fact
during
her
stay
at
Gardencourt
.
*NL*
But
it
had
been
one
thing
to
foresee
such
a
matter
mentally
and
another
*NL*
to
stand
among
its
massive
records
.
The
idea
of
a
distribution
of
*NL*
property
--
she
would
almost
have
said
of
spoils
--
just
now
pressed
upon
*NL*
her
senses
and
irritated
her
with
a
sense
of
exclusion
.
I
am
far
from
*NL*
wishing
to
picture
her
as
one
of
the
hungry
mouths
or
envious
hearts
of
*NL*
the
general
herd
,
but
we
have
already
learned
of
her
having
desires
*NL*
that
had
never
been
satisfied
.
If
she
had
been
questioned
,
she
would
*NL*
of
course
have
admitted
--
with
a
fine
proud
smile
--
that
she
had
not
the
*NL*
faintest
claim
to
a
share
in
Mr.
Touchett
's
relics
.
``
There
was
never
*NL*
anything
in
the
world
between
us
,
''
she
would
have
said
.
``
There
was
never
*NL*
that
,
poor
man
!
''
--
with
a
fillip
of
her
thumb
and
her
third
finger
.
I
*NL*
hasten
to
add
,
moreover
,
that
if
she
could
n't
at
the
present
moment
keep
*NL*
from
quite
perversely
yearning
she
was
careful
not
to
betray
herself
.
*NL*
She
had
after
all
as
much
sympathy
for
Mrs.
Touchett
's
gains
as
for
her
*NL*
losses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
left
me
this
house
,
''
the
newly-made
widow
said
;
``
but
of
course
*NL*
I
shall
not
live
in
it
;
I
've
a
much
better
one
in
Florence
.
The
will
*NL*
was
opened
only
three
days
since
,
but
I
've
already
offered
the
house
for
*NL*
sale
.
I
've
also
a
share
in
the
bank
;
but
I
do
n't
yet
understand
if
I
'm
*NL*
obliged
to
leave
it
there
.
If
not
I
shall
certainly
take
it
out
.
Ralph
,
*NL*
of
course
,
has
Gardencourt
;
but
I
'm
not
sure
that
he
'll
have
means
to
*NL*
keep
up
the
place
.
He
's
naturally
left
very
well
off
,
but
his
father
has
*NL*
given
away
an
immense
deal
of
money
;
there
are
bequests
to
a
string
of
*NL*
third
cousins
in
Vermont
.
Ralph
,
however
,
is
very
fond
of
Gardencourt
*NL*
and
would
be
quite
capable
of
living
there
--
in
summer
--
with
a
*NL*
maid-of-all-work
and
a
gardener
's
boy
.
There
's
one
remarkable
clause
*NL*
in
my
husband
's
will
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
added
.
``
He
has
left
my
niece
a
*NL*
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fortune
!
''
Madame
Merle
softly
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabel
steps
into
something
like
seventy
thousand
pounds
.
''
Madame
*NL*
Merle
's
hands
were
clasped
in
her
lap
;
at
this
she
raised
them
,
still
*NL*
clasped
,
and
held
them
a
moment
against
her
bosom
while
her
eyes
,
a
*NL*
little
dilated
,
fixed
themselves
on
those
of
her
friend
.
``
Ah
,
''
she
*NL*
cried
,
``
the
clever
creature
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
gave
her
a
quick
look
.
``
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
Madame
Merle
's
colour
rose
and
she
dropped
her
eyes
.
``
It
*NL*
certainly
is
clever
to
achieve
such
results
--
without
an
effort
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
assuredly
was
no
effort
.
Do
n't
call
it
an
achievement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
was
seldom
guilty
of
the
awkwardness
of
retracting
what
she
*NL*
had
said
;
her
wisdom
was
shown
rather
in
maintaining
it
and
placing
it
*NL*
in
a
favourable
light
.
``
My
dear
friend
,
Isabel
would
certainly
not
*NL*
have
had
seventy
thousand
pounds
left
her
if
she
had
not
been
the
most
*NL*
charming
girl
in
the
world
.
Her
charm
includes
great
cleverness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
dreamed
,
I
'm
sure
,
of
my
husband
's
doing
anything
for
her
;
*NL*
and
I
never
dreamed
of
it
either
,
for
he
never
spoke
to
me
of
his
*NL*
intention
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
said
.
``
She
had
no
claim
upon
him
whatever
;
it
*NL*
was
no
great
recommendation
to
him
that
she
was
my
niece
.
Whatever
she
*NL*
achieved
she
achieved
unconsciously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
rejoined
Madame
Merle
,
``
those
are
the
greatest
strokes
!
''
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
reserved
her
opinion
.
``
The
girl
's
fortunate
;
I
do
n't
deny
that
.
*NL*
But
for
the
present
she
's
simply
stupefied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
that
she
does
n't
know
what
to
do
with
the
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
I
think
,
she
has
hardly
considered
.
She
does
n't
know
what
to
*NL*
think
about
the
matter
at
all
.
It
has
been
as
if
a
big
gun
were
suddenly
*NL*
fired
off
behind
her
;
she
's
feeling
herself
to
see
if
she
be
hurt
.
It
's
*NL*
but
three
days
since
she
received
a
visit
from
the
principal
executor
,
*NL*
who
came
in
person
,
very
gallantly
,
to
notify
her
.
He
told
me
afterwards
*NL*
that
when
he
had
made
his
little
speech
she
suddenly
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
The
money
's
to
remain
in
the
affairs
of
the
bank
,
and
she
's
to
draw
the
*NL*
interest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
shook
her
head
with
a
wise
and
now
quite
benignant
smile
.
*NL*
``
How
very
delicious
!
After
she
has
done
that
two
or
three
times
she
'll
*NL*
get
used
to
it
.
''
Then
after
a
silence
,
``
What
does
your
son
think
of
it
?
''
*NL*
she
abruptly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
left
England
before
the
will
was
read
--
used
up
by
his
fatigue
and
*NL*
anxiety
and
hurrying
off
to
the
south
.
He
's
on
his
way
to
the
Riviera
*NL*
and
I
've
not
yet
heard
from
him
.
But
it
's
not
likely
he
'll
ever
object
*NL*
to
anything
done
by
his
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
you
say
his
own
share
had
been
cut
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
at
his
wish
.
I
know
that
he
urged
his
father
to
do
something
for
*NL*
the
people
in
America
.
He
's
not
in
the
least
addicted
to
looking
after
*NL*
number
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
depends
upon
whom
he
regards
as
number
one
!
''
said
Madame
Merle
.
And
*NL*
she
remained
thoughtful
a
moment
,
her
eyes
bent
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
not
to
see
your
happy
niece
?
''
she
asked
at
last
as
she
raised
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
see
her
;
but
you
'll
not
be
struck
with
her
being
happy
.
She
*NL*
has
looked
as
solemn
,
these
three
days
,
as
a
Cimabue
Madonna
!
''
And
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
rang
for
a
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
came
in
shortly
after
the
footman
had
been
sent
to
call
her
;
and
*NL*
Madame
Merle
thought
,
as
she
appeared
,
that
Mrs.
Touchett
's
comparison
*NL*
had
its
force
.
The
girl
was
pale
and
grave
--
an
effect
not
mitigated
by
*NL*
her
deeper
mourning
;
but
the
smile
of
her
brightest
moments
came
into
*NL*
her
face
as
she
saw
Madame
Merle
,
who
went
forward
,
laid
her
hand
on
our
*NL*
heroine
's
shoulder
and
,
after
looking
at
her
a
moment
,
kissed
her
as
if
*NL*
she
were
returning
the
kiss
she
had
received
from
her
at
Gardencourt
.
*NL*
This
was
the
only
allusion
the
visitor
,
in
her
great
good
taste
,
made
*NL*
for
the
present
to
her
young
friend
's
inheritance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
had
no
purpose
of
awaiting
in
London
the
sale
of
her
*NL*
house
.
After
selecting
from
among
its
furniture
the
objects
she
wished
*NL*
to
transport
to
her
other
abode
,
she
left
the
rest
of
its
contents
to
be
*NL*
disposed
of
by
the
auctioneer
and
took
her
departure
for
the
Continent
.
*NL*
She
was
of
course
accompanied
on
this
journey
by
her
niece
,
who
now
had
*NL*
plenty
of
leisure
to
measure
and
weigh
and
otherwise
handle
the
windfall
*NL*
on
which
Madame
Merle
had
covertly
congratulated
her
.
Isabel
thought
*NL*
very
often
of
the
fact
of
her
accession
of
means
,
looking
at
it
in
a
*NL*
dozen
different
lights
;
but
we
shall
not
now
attempt
to
follow
her
train
*NL*
of
thought
or
to
explain
exactly
why
her
new
consciousness
was
at
first
*NL*
oppressive
.
This
failure
to
rise
to
immediate
joy
was
indeed
but
brief
;
*NL*
the
girl
presently
made
up
her
mind
that
to
be
rich
was
a
virtue
because
*NL*
it
was
to
be
able
to
do
,
and
that
to
do
could
only
be
sweet
.
It
was
*NL*
the
graceful
contrary
of
the
stupid
side
of
weakness
--
especially
the
*NL*
feminine
variety
.
To
be
weak
was
,
for
a
delicate
young
person
,
rather
*NL*
graceful
,
but
,
after
all
,
as
Isabel
said
to
herself
,
there
was
a
larger
*NL*
grace
than
that
.
Just
now
,
it
is
true
,
there
was
not
much
to
do
--
once
*NL*
she
had
sent
off
a
cheque
to
Lily
and
another
to
poor
Edith
;
but
she
was
*NL*
thankful
for
the
quiet
months
which
her
mourning
robes
and
her
aunt
's
*NL*
fresh
widowhood
compelled
them
to
spend
together
.
The
acquisition
of
*NL*
power
made
her
serious
;
she
scrutinised
her
power
with
a
kind
of
tender
*NL*
ferocity
,
but
was
not
eager
to
exercise
it
.
She
began
to
do
so
during
*NL*
a
stay
of
some
weeks
which
she
eventually
made
with
her
aunt
in
Paris
,
*NL*
though
in
ways
that
will
inevitably
present
themselves
as
trivial
.
They
*NL*
were
the
ways
most
naturally
imposed
in
a
city
in
which
the
shops
are
*NL*
the
admiration
of
the
world
,
and
that
were
prescribed
unreservedly
by
*NL*
the
guidance
of
Mrs.
Touchett
,
who
took
a
rigidly
practical
view
of
the
*NL*
transformation
of
her
niece
from
a
poor
girl
to
a
rich
one
.
``
Now
that
*NL*
you
're
a
young
woman
of
fortune
you
must
know
how
to
play
the
part
--
I
*NL*
mean
to
play
it
well
,
''
she
said
to
Isabel
once
for
all
;
and
she
added
*NL*
that
the
girl
's
first
duty
was
to
have
everything
handsome
.
``
You
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
take
care
of
your
things
,
but
you
must
learn
,
''
she
went
on
;
*NL*
this
was
Isabel
's
second
duty
.
Isabel
submitted
,
but
for
the
present
*NL*
her
imagination
was
not
kindled
;
she
longed
for
opportunities
,
but
these
*NL*
were
not
the
opportunities
she
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
rarely
changed
her
plans
,
and
,
having
intended
before
her
*NL*
husband
's
death
to
spend
a
part
of
the
winter
in
Paris
,
saw
no
reason
to
*NL*
deprive
herself
--
still
less
to
deprive
her
companion
--
of
this
advantage
.
*NL*
Though
they
would
live
in
great
retirement
she
might
still
present
*NL*
her
niece
,
informally
,
to
the
little
circle
of
her
fellow
countrymen
*NL*
dwelling
upon
the
skirts
of
the
Champs
Elysees
.
With
many
of
these
*NL*
amiable
colonists
Mrs.
Touchett
was
intimate
;
she
shared
their
*NL*
expatriation
,
their
convictions
,
their
pastimes
,
their
ennui
.
Isabel
*NL*
saw
them
arrive
with
a
good
deal
of
assiduity
at
her
aunt
's
hotel
,
and
*NL*
pronounced
on
them
with
a
trenchancy
doubtless
to
be
accounted
for
by
*NL*
the
temporary
exaltation
of
her
sense
of
human
duty
.
She
made
up
her
*NL*
mind
that
their
lives
were
,
though
luxurious
,
inane
,
and
incurred
some
*NL*
disfavour
by
expressing
this
view
on
bright
Sunday
afternoons
,
when
the
*NL*
American
absentees
were
engaged
in
calling
on
each
other
.
Though
her
*NL*
listeners
passed
for
people
kept
exemplarily
genial
by
their
cooks
and
*NL*
dressmakers
,
two
or
three
of
them
thought
her
cleverness
,
which
was
*NL*
generally
admitted
,
inferior
to
that
of
the
new
theatrical
pieces
.
``
You
*NL*
all
live
here
this
way
,
but
what
does
it
lead
to
?
''
she
was
pleased
to
*NL*
ask
.
``
It
does
n't
seem
to
lead
to
anything
,
and
I
should
think
you
'd
get
*NL*
very
tired
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
thought
the
question
worthy
of
Henrietta
Stackpole
.
The
*NL*
two
ladies
had
found
Henrietta
in
Paris
,
and
Isabel
constantly
saw
her
;
*NL*
so
that
Mrs.
Touchett
had
some
reason
for
saying
to
herself
that
if
her
*NL*
niece
were
not
clever
enough
to
originate
almost
anything
,
she
might
be
*NL*
suspected
of
having
borrowed
that
style
of
remark
from
her
journalistic
*NL*
friend
.
The
first
occasion
on
which
Isabel
had
spoken
was
that
of
*NL*
a
visit
paid
by
the
two
ladies
to
Mrs.
Luce
,
an
old
friend
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
's
and
the
only
person
in
Paris
she
now
went
to
see
.
Mrs.
Luce
*NL*
had
been
living
in
Paris
since
the
days
of
Louis
Philippe
;
she
used
to
*NL*
say
jocosely
that
she
was
one
of
the
generation
of
1830
--
a
joke
of
*NL*
which
the
point
was
not
always
taken
.
When
it
failed
Mrs.
Luce
used
to
*NL*
explain
--
``
Oh
yes
,
I
'm
one
of
the
romantics
;
''
her
French
had
never
*NL*
become
quite
perfect
.
She
was
always
at
home
on
Sunday
afternoons
and
*NL*
surrounded
by
sympathetic
compatriots
,
usually
the
same
.
In
fact
she
*NL*
was
at
home
at
all
times
,
and
reproduced
with
wondrous
truth
in
her
*NL*
well-cushioned
little
corner
of
the
brilliant
city
,
the
domestic
tone
of
*NL*
her
native
Baltimore
.
This
reduced
Mr.
Luce
,
her
worthy
husband
,
a
tall
,
*NL*
lean
,
grizzled
,
well-brushed
gentleman
who
wore
a
gold
eye-glass
and
*NL*
carried
his
hat
a
little
too
much
on
the
back
of
his
head
,
to
mere
*NL*
platonic
praise
of
the
``
distractions
''
of
Paris
--
they
were
his
great
*NL*
word
--
since
you
would
never
have
guessed
from
what
cares
he
escaped
to
*NL*
them
.
One
of
them
was
that
he
went
every
day
to
the
American
banker
's
,
*NL*
where
he
found
a
post-office
that
was
almost
as
sociable
and
colloquial
*NL*
an
institution
as
in
an
American
country
town
.
He
passed
an
hour
-LRB-
in
*NL*
fine
weather
-RRB-
in
a
chair
in
the
Champs
Elysees
,
and
he
dined
uncommonly
*NL*
well
at
his
own
table
,
seated
above
a
waxed
floor
which
it
was
Mrs.
*NL*
Luce
's
happiness
to
believe
had
a
finer
polish
than
any
other
in
the
*NL*
French
capital
.
Occasionally
he
dined
with
a
friend
or
two
at
the
Cafe
*NL*
Anglais
,
where
his
talent
for
ordering
a
dinner
was
a
source
of
felicity
*NL*
to
his
companions
and
an
object
of
admiration
even
to
the
headwaiter
*NL*
of
the
establishment
.
These
were
his
only
known
pastimes
,
but
they
had
*NL*
beguiled
his
hours
for
upwards
of
half
a
century
,
and
they
doubtless
*NL*
justified
his
frequent
declaration
that
there
was
no
place
like
Paris
.
*NL*
In
no
other
place
,
on
these
terms
,
could
Mr.
Luce
flatter
himself
that
*NL*
he
was
enjoying
life
.
There
was
nothing
like
Paris
,
but
it
must
be
*NL*
confessed
that
Mr.
Luce
thought
less
highly
of
this
scene
of
his
*NL*
dissipations
than
in
earlier
days
.
In
the
list
of
his
resources
his
*NL*
political
reflections
should
not
be
omitted
,
for
they
were
doubtless
the
*NL*
animating
principle
of
many
hours
that
superficially
seemed
vacant
.
*NL*
Like
many
of
his
fellow
colonists
Mr.
Luce
was
a
high
--
or
rather
a
*NL*
deep
--
conservative
,
and
gave
no
countenance
to
the
government
lately
*NL*
established
in
France
.
He
had
no
faith
in
its
duration
and
would
assure
*NL*
you
from
year
to
year
that
its
end
was
close
at
hand
.
``
They
want
to
be
*NL*
kept
down
,
sir
,
to
be
kept
down
;
nothing
but
the
strong
hand
--
the
iron
*NL*
heel
--
will
do
for
them
,
''
he
would
frequently
say
of
the
French
people
;
*NL*
and
his
ideal
of
a
fine
showy
clever
rule
was
that
of
the
superseded
*NL*
Empire
.
``
Paris
is
much
less
attractive
than
in
the
days
of
the
Emperor
;
*NL*
HE
knew
how
to
make
a
city
pleasant
,
''
Mr.
Luce
had
often
remarked
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
,
who
was
quite
of
his
own
way
of
thinking
and
wished
to
*NL*
know
what
one
had
crossed
that
odious
Atlantic
for
but
to
get
away
from
*NL*
republics
.
*NL*

``
Why
,
madam
,
sitting
in
the
Champs
Elysees
,
opposite
to
the
Palace
of
*NL*
Industry
,
I
've
seen
the
court-carriages
from
the
Tuileries
pass
up
and
*NL*
down
as
many
as
seven
times
a
day
.
I
remember
one
occasion
when
they
*NL*
went
as
high
as
nine
.
What
do
you
see
now
?
It
's
no
use
talking
,
the
*NL*
style
's
all
gone
.
Napoleon
knew
what
the
French
people
want
,
and
*NL*
there
'll
be
a
dark
cloud
over
Paris
,
our
Paris
,
till
they
get
the
Empire
*NL*
back
again
.

*NL*
*NL*
Among
Mrs.
Luce
's
visitors
on
Sunday
afternoons
was
a
young
man
with
*NL*
whom
Isabel
had
had
a
good
deal
of
conversation
and
whom
she
found
*NL*
full
of
valuable
knowledge
.
Mr.
Edward
Rosier
--
Ned
Rosier
as
he
was
*NL*
called
--
was
native
to
New
York
and
had
been
brought
up
in
Paris
,
living
*NL*
there
under
the
eye
of
his
father
who
,
as
it
happened
,
had
been
an
early
*NL*
and
intimate
friend
of
the
late
Mr.
Archer
.
Edward
Rosier
remembered
*NL*
Isabel
as
a
little
girl
;
it
had
been
his
father
who
came
to
the
rescue
*NL*
of
the
small
Archers
at
the
inn
at
Neufchatel
-LRB-
he
was
travelling
that
*NL*
way
with
the
boy
and
had
stopped
at
the
hotel
by
chance
-RRB-
,
after
their
*NL*
bonne
had
gone
off
with
the
Russian
prince
and
when
Mr.
Archer
's
*NL*
whereabouts
remained
for
some
days
a
mystery
.
Isabel
remembered
*NL*
perfectly
the
neat
little
male
child
whose
hair
smelt
of
a
delicious
*NL*
cosmetic
and
who
had
a
bonne
all
his
own
,
warranted
to
lose
sight
of
him
*NL*
under
no
provocation
.
Isabel
took
a
walk
with
the
pair
beside
the
lake
*NL*
and
thought
little
Edward
as
pretty
as
an
angel
--
a
comparison
by
no
*NL*
means
conventional
in
her
mind
,
for
she
had
a
very
definite
conception
*NL*
of
a
type
of
features
which
she
supposed
to
be
angelic
and
which
her
*NL*
new
friend
perfectly
illustrated
.
A
small
pink
face
surmounted
by
a
blue
*NL*
velvet
bonnet
and
set
off
by
a
stiff
embroidered
collar
had
become
the
*NL*
countenance
of
her
childish
dreams
;
and
she
had
firmly
believed
for
some
*NL*
time
afterwards
that
the
heavenly
hosts
conversed
among
themselves
in
*NL*
a
queer
little
dialect
of
French-English
,
expressing
the
properest
*NL*
sentiments
,
as
when
Edward
told
her
that
he
was
``
defended
''
by
his
bonne
*NL*
to
go
near
the
edge
of
the
lake
,
and
that
one
must
always
obey
to
one
's
*NL*
bonne
.
Ned
Rosier
's
English
had
improved
;
at
least
it
exhibited
in
a
*NL*
less
degree
the
French
variation
.
His
father
was
dead
and
his
bonne
*NL*
dismissed
,
but
the
young
man
still
conformed
to
the
spirit
of
their
*NL*
teaching
--
he
never
went
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
.
There
was
still
*NL*
something
agreeable
to
the
nostrils
about
him
and
something
not
*NL*
offensive
to
nobler
organs
.
He
was
a
very
gentle
and
gracious
youth
,
*NL*
with
what
are
called
cultivated
tastes
--
an
acquaintance
with
old
china
,
*NL*
with
good
wine
,
with
the
bindings
of
books
,
with
the
Almanach
de
Gotha
,
*NL*
with
the
best
shops
,
the
best
hotels
,
the
hours
of
railway-trains
.
He
*NL*
could
order
a
dinner
almost
as
well
as
Mr.
Luce
,
and
it
was
probable
*NL*
that
as
his
experience
accumulated
he
would
be
a
worthy
successor
to
*NL*
that
gentleman
,
whose
rather
grim
politics
he
also
advocated
in
a
soft
*NL*
and
innocent
voice
.
He
had
some
charming
rooms
in
Paris
,
decorated
with
*NL*
old
Spanish
altar-lace
,
the
envy
of
his
female
friends
,
who
declared
*NL*
that
his
chimney-piece
was
better
draped
than
the
high
shoulders
of
many
*NL*
a
duchess
.
He
usually
,
however
,
spent
a
part
of
every
winter
at
Pau
,
and
*NL*
had
once
passed
a
couple
of
months
in
the
United
States
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
great
interest
in
Isabel
and
remembered
perfectly
the
walk
at
*NL*
Neufchatel
,
when
she
would
persist
in
going
so
near
the
edge
.
He
seemed
*NL*
to
recognise
this
same
tendency
in
the
subversive
enquiry
that
I
quoted
*NL*
a
moment
ago
,
and
set
himself
to
answer
our
heroine
's
question
with
*NL*
greater
urbanity
than
it
perhaps
deserved
.
``
What
does
it
lead
to
,
Miss
*NL*
Archer
?
Why
Paris
leads
everywhere
.
You
ca
n't
go
anywhere
unless
you
*NL*
come
here
first
.
Every
one
that
comes
to
Europe
has
got
to
pass
through
.
*NL*
You
do
n't
mean
it
in
that
sense
so
much
?
You
mean
what
good
it
does
you
?
*NL*
Well
,
how
can
you
penetrate
futurity
?
How
can
you
tell
what
lies
ahead
?
*NL*
If
it
's
a
pleasant
road
I
do
n't
care
where
it
leads
.
I
like
the
road
,
*NL*
Miss
Archer
;
I
like
the
dear
old
asphalte
.
You
ca
n't
get
tired
of
*NL*
it
--
you
ca
n't
if
you
try
.
You
think
you
would
,
but
you
would
n't
;
*NL*
there
's
always
something
new
and
fresh
.
Take
the
Hotel
Drouot
,
now
;
*NL*
they
sometimes
have
three
and
four
sales
a
week
.
Where
can
you
get
such
*NL*
things
as
you
can
here
?
In
spite
of
all
they
say
I
maintain
they
're
*NL*
cheaper
too
,
if
you
know
the
right
places
.
I
know
plenty
of
places
,
*NL*
but
I
keep
them
to
myself
.
I
'll
tell
you
,
if
you
like
,
as
a
particular
*NL*
favour
;
only
you
must
n't
tell
any
one
else
.
Do
n't
you
go
anywhere
*NL*
without
asking
me
first
;
I
want
you
to
promise
me
that
.
As
a
general
*NL*
thing
avoid
the
Boulevards
;
there
's
very
little
to
be
done
on
the
*NL*
Boulevards
.
Speaking
conscientiously
--
sans
blague
--
I
do
n't
believe
*NL*
any
one
knows
Paris
better
than
I
.
You
and
Mrs.
Touchett
must
come
and
*NL*
breakfast
with
me
some
day
,
and
I
'll
show
you
my
things
;
je
ne
vous
dis
*NL*
que
ca
!
There
has
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
London
of
late
;
it
's
*NL*
the
fashion
to
cry
up
London
.
But
there
's
nothing
in
it
--
you
ca
n't
*NL*
do
anything
in
London
.
No
Louis
Quinze
--
nothing
of
the
First
Empire
;
*NL*
nothing
but
their
eternal
Queen
Anne
.
It
's
good
for
one
's
bed-room
,
*NL*
Queen
Anne
--
for
one
's
washing-room
;
but
it
is
n't
proper
for
a
salon
.
Do
*NL*
I
spend
my
life
at
the
auctioneer
's
?
''
Mr.
Rosier
pursued
in
answer
to
*NL*
another
question
of
Isabel
's
.
``
Oh
no
;
I
have
n't
the
means
.
I
wish
I
*NL*
had
.
You
think
I
'm
a
mere
trifler
;
I
can
tell
by
the
expression
of
your
*NL*
face
--
you
've
got
a
wonderfully
expressive
face
.
I
hope
you
do
n't
mind
*NL*
my
saying
that
;
I
mean
it
as
a
kind
of
warning
.
You
think
I
ought
to
do
*NL*
something
,
and
so
do
I
,
so
long
as
you
leave
it
vague
.
But
when
you
*NL*
come
to
the
point
you
see
you
have
to
stop
.
I
ca
n't
go
home
and
be
*NL*
a
shopkeeper
.
You
think
I
'm
very
well
fitted
?
Ah
,
Miss
Archer
,
you
*NL*
overrate
me
.
I
can
buy
very
well
,
but
I
ca
n't
sell
;
you
should
see
when
*NL*
I
sometimes
try
to
get
rid
of
my
things
.
It
takes
much
more
ability
to
*NL*
make
other
people
buy
than
to
buy
yourself
.
When
I
think
how
clever
they
*NL*
must
be
,
the
people
who
make
ME
buy
!
Ah
no
;
I
could
n't
be
a
shopkeeper
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
be
a
doctor
;
it
's
a
repulsive
business
.
I
ca
n't
be
a
clergyman
;
*NL*
I
have
n't
got
convictions
.
And
then
I
ca
n't
pronounce
the
names
right
in
*NL*
the
Bible
.
They
're
very
difficult
,
in
the
Old
Testament
particularly
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
be
a
lawyer
;
I
do
n't
understand
--
how
do
you
call
it
?
--
the
American
*NL*
procedure
.
Is
there
anything
else
?
There
's
nothing
for
a
gentleman
*NL*
in
America
.
I
should
like
to
be
a
diplomatist
;
but
American
*NL*
diplomacy
--
that
's
not
for
gentlemen
either
.
I
'm
sure
if
you
had
seen
the
*NL*
last
min
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
Stackpole
,
who
was
often
with
her
friend
when
Mr.
Rosier
,
*NL*
coming
to
pay
his
compliments
late
in
the
afternoon
,
expressed
himself
*NL*
after
the
fashion
I
have
sketched
,
usually
interrupted
the
young
man
at
*NL*
this
point
and
read
him
a
lecture
on
the
duties
of
the
American
citizen
.
*NL*
She
thought
him
most
unnatural
;
he
was
worse
than
poor
Ralph
Touchett
.
*NL*
Henrietta
,
however
,
was
at
this
time
more
than
ever
addicted
to
fine
*NL*
criticism
,
for
her
conscience
had
been
freshly
alarmed
as
regards
*NL*
Isabel
.
She
had
not
congratulated
this
young
lady
on
her
augmentations
*NL*
and
begged
to
be
excused
from
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Mr.
Touchett
had
consulted
me
about
leaving
you
the
money

she
*NL*
frankly
asserted

``
I
'd
have
said
to
him
`
Never
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,

Isabel
had
answered
.
``
You
think
it
will
prove
a
curse
in

Perhaps
it
will

*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
it

what
I
should
have

said

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
yourself
for
instance

Isabel
suggested
jocosely
.
And
then
,
``
Do
you
*NL*
really
believe
it
will
ruin
me
?
''
she
asked
in
quite
another
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
wo
n't
ruin
you
;
but
it
will
certainly
confirm
your
dangerous
*NL*
tendencies

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
the
love
of
luxury
--
of
extravagance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Henrietta
;
``
I
mean
your
exposure
on
the
moral
side

I
*NL*
approve
of
luxury
;
I
think
we
ought
to
be
as
elegant
as
possible
.
Look
*NL*
at
the
luxury
of
our
western
cities
;
I
've
seen
nothing
over
here
to
*NL*
compare
with
it
.
I
hope
you
'll
never
become
grossly
sensual
;
but
I
'm
not
*NL*
afraid
of
that
.
The
peril
for
you
is
that
you
live
too
much
in
the
world

of
your
own
dreams

You
're
not

in
contact
with

the
toiling

striving

suffering

may
even
say
sinning

world
*NL*

surrounds
you

You
're
too
fastidious

many
graceful

Your
newly-acquired
thousands
will
shut

up

more
to

society

selfish

heartless
people

will
be

interested

keeping
them
up

*NL*
Isabel
's
eyes
expanded
as
she
gazed
at
this
lurid
scene
.
``
What
are
my
*NL*
illusions

she
asked
.
``
I
try
so
hard
not
to
have
any

*NL*
``
Well
,

said
Henrietta
,
``
you
think
you
can
lead
a
romantic
life
,
that
*NL*
you
can
live
by
pleasing
yourself
and
pleasing
others
.
You
'll
find
*NL*
you
're
mistaken
.
Whatever
life
you
lead
you
must
put
your
soul
in
it
--
to
*NL*
make
any
sort
of
success
of
it
;
and
from
the
moment
you
do
that
it
*NL*
ceases
to
be
romance

I
assure
you

it
becomes
grim
reality

And
you
*NL*
ca

always
please
yourself
;
you
must
sometimes
please
other
people

*NL*
That
,
I
admit
,
you
're
very
ready
to
do
;
but
there
's
another
thing
that
's
*NL*
still
more
important
--
you
must
often
displease
others

You
must
always
*NL*
be
ready
for
that

you

never
shrink
from

fond

can
escape
disagreeable
duties
by
taking
romantic

views

your
great
illusion

my
dear

ca

prepared
on

occasions
in
life
to
please
no
one
at
all

not
even
*NL*
yourself

''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
shook
her
head
sadly
;
she
looked
troubled
and
frightened
.
``
This
,
*NL*
for
you

''
she
said

``
must
be
one
of
those
occasions

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
certainly
true
that
Miss
Stackpole
,
during
her
visit
to
Paris
,
*NL*
which
had
been
professionally
more
remunerative
than
her
English
*NL*
sojourn
,
had
not
been
living
in
the
world
of
dreams
.
Mr.
Bantling
,
who
*NL*
had
now
returned
to
England
,
was
her
companion
for
the
first
four
weeks
*NL*
of
her
stay
;
and
about
Mr.
Bantling
there
was
nothing
dreamy
.
Isabel
*NL*
learned
from
her
friend
that
the
two
had
led
a
life
of
great
personal
*NL*
intimacy
and
that
this
had
been
a
peculiar
advantage
to
Henrietta
,
*NL*
owing
to
the
gentleman
's
remarkable
knowledge
of
Paris
.
He
had
*NL*
explained
everything
,
shown
her
everything
,
been
her
constant
guide
and
*NL*
interpreter
.
They
had
breakfasted
together
,
dined
together
,
gone
to
*NL*
the
theatre
together
,
supped
together
,
really
in
a
manner
quite
lived
*NL*
together
.
He
was
a
true
friend
,
Henrietta
more
than
once
assured
our
*NL*
heroine
;
and
she
had
never
supposed
that
she
could
like
any
Englishman
*NL*
so
well
.
Isabel
could
not
have
told
you
why
,
but
she
found
something
*NL*
that
ministered
to
mirth
in
the
alliance
the
correspondent
of
the
*NL*
Interviewer
had
struck
with
Lady
Pensil
's
brother
;
her
amusement
*NL*
moreover
subsisted
in
face
of
the
fact
that
she
thought
it
a
credit
to
*NL*
each
of
them
.
Isabel
could
n't
rid
herself
of
a
suspicion
that
they
were
*NL*
playing
somehow
at
cross-purposes
--
that
the
simplicity
of
each
had
*NL*
been
entrapped
.
But
this
simplicity
was
on
either
side
none
the
less
*NL*
honourable
.
It
was
as
graceful
on
Henrietta
's
part
to
believe
that
Mr.
*NL*
Bantling
took
an
interest
in
the
diffusion
of
lively
journalism
and
in
*NL*
consolidating
the
position
of
lady-correspondents
as
it
was
on
the
*NL*
part
of
his
companion
to
suppose
that
the
cause
of
the
Interviewer
--
a
*NL*
periodical
of
which
he
never
formed
a
very
definite
conception
--
was
,
if
*NL*
subtly
analysed
-LRB-
a
task
to
which
Mr.
Bantling
felt
himself
quite
equal
-RRB-
,
*NL*
but
the
cause
of
Miss
Stackpole
's
need
of
demonstrative
affection
.
Each
*NL*
of
these
groping
celibates
supplied
at
any
rate
a
want
of
which
the
*NL*
other
was
impatiently
conscious
.
Mr.
Bantling
,
who
was
of
rather
a
slow
*NL*
and
a
discursive
habit
,
relished
a
prompt
,
keen
,
positive
woman
,
who
*NL*
charmed
him
by
the
influence
of
a
shining
,
challenging
eye
and
a
kind
of
*NL*
bandbox
freshness
,
and
who
kindled
a
perception
of
raciness
in
a
mind
*NL*
to
which
the
usual
fare
of
life
seemed
unsalted
.
Henrietta
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
enjoyed
the
society
of
a
gentleman
who
appeared
somehow
,
in
his
*NL*
way
,
made
,
by
expensive
,
roundabout
,
almost
``
quaint
''
processes
,
for
*NL*
her
use
,
and
whose
leisured
state
,
though
generally
indefensible
,
was
a
*NL*
decided
boon
to
a
breathless
mate
,
and
who
was
furnished
with
an
easy
,
*NL*
traditional
,
though
by
no
means
exhaustive
,
answer
to
almost
any
social
*NL*
or
practical
question
that
could
come
up
.
She
often
found
Mr.
Bantling
's
*NL*
answers
very
convenient
,
and
in
the
press
of
catching
the
American
post
*NL*
would
largely
and
showily
address
them
to
publicity
.
It
was
to
be
feared
*NL*
that
she
was
indeed
drifting
toward
those
abysses
of
sophistication
as
*NL*
to
which
Isabel
,
wishing
for
a
good-humoured
retort
,
had
warned
her
.
*NL*
There
might
be
danger
in
store
for
Isabel
;
but
it
was
scarcely
to
be
*NL*
hoped
that
Miss
Stackpole
,
on
her
side
,
would
find
permanent
rest
in
any
*NL*
adoption
of
the
views
of
a
class
pledged
to
all
the
old
abuses
.
Isabel
*NL*
continued
to
warn
her
good-humouredly
;
Lady
Pensil
's
obliging
brother
*NL*
was
sometimes
,
on
our
heroine
's
lips
,
an
object
of
irreverent
and
*NL*
facetious
allusion
.
Nothing
,
however
,
could
exceed
Henrietta
's
*NL*
amiability
on
this
point
;
she
used
to
abound
in
the
sense
of
Isabel
's
*NL*
irony
and
to
enumerate
with
elation
the
hours
she
had
spent
with
this
*NL*
perfect
man
of
the
world
--
a
term
that
had
ceased
to
make
with
her
,
as
*NL*
previously
,
for
opprobrium
.
Then
,
a
few
moments
later
,
she
would
forget
*NL*
that
they
had
been
talking
jocosely
and
would
mention
with
impulsive
*NL*
earnestness
some
expedition
she
had
enjoyed
in
his
company
.
She
would
*NL*
say
:
``
Oh
,
I
know
all
about
Versailles
;
I
went
there
with
Mr.
Bantling
.
I
*NL*
was
bound
to
see
it
thoroughly
--
I
warned
him
when
we
went
out
there
that
*NL*
I
was
thorough
:
so
we
spent
three
days
at
the
hotel
and
wandered
all
*NL*
over
the
place
.
It
was
lovely
weather
--
a
kind
of
Indian
summer
,
only
not
*NL*
so
good
.
We
just
lived
in
that
park
.
Oh
yes
;
you
ca
n't
tell
me
anything
*NL*
about
Versailles
.
''
Henrietta
appeared
to
have
made
arrangements
to
meet
*NL*
her
gallant
friend
during
the
spring
in
Italy
.

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
,
before
arriving
in
Paris
,
had
fixed
the
day
for
her
*NL*
departure
and
by
the
middle
of
February
had
begun
to
travel
southward
.
*NL*
She
interrupted
her
journey
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
son
,
who
at
San
Remo
,
*NL*
on
the
Italian
shore
of
the
Mediterranean
,
had
been
spending
a
dull
,
*NL*
bright
winter
beneath
a
slow-moving
white
umbrella
.
Isabel
went
with
her
*NL*
aunt
as
a
matter
of
course
,
though
Mrs.
Touchett
,
with
homely
,
customary
*NL*
logic
,
had
laid
before
her
a
pair
of
alternatives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
of
course
,
you
're
completely
your
own
mistress
and
are
as
free
as
*NL*
the
bird
on
the
bough
.
I
do
n't
mean
you
were
not
so
before
,
but
you
're
*NL*
at
present
on
a
different
footing
--
property
erects
a
kind
of
barrier
.
*NL*
You
can
do
a
great
many
things
if
you
're
rich
which
would
be
severely
*NL*
criticised
if
you
were
poor
.
You
can
go
and
come
,
you
can
travel
alone
,
*NL*
you
can
have
your
own
establishment
:
I
mean
of
course
if
you
'll
take
*NL*
a
companion
--
some
decayed
gentlewoman
,
with
a
darned
cashmere
and
dyed
*NL*
hair
,
who
paints
on
velvet
.
You
do
n't
think
you
'd
like
that
?
Of
course
*NL*
you
can
do
as
you
please
;
I
only
want
you
to
understand
how
much
you
're
*NL*
at
liberty
.
You
might
take
Miss
Stackpole
as
your
dame
de
compagnie
;
*NL*
she
'd
keep
people
off
very
well
.
I
think
,
however
,
that
it
's
a
great
*NL*
deal
better
you
should
remain
with
me
,
in
spite
of
there
being
no
*NL*
obligation
.
It
's
better
for
several
reasons
,
quite
apart
from
your
*NL*
liking
it
.
I
should
n't
think
you
'd
like
it
,
but
I
recommend
you
to
make
*NL*
the
sacrifice
.
Of
course
whatever
novelty
there
may
have
been
at
first
*NL*
in
my
society
has
quite
passed
away
,
and
you
see
me
as
I
am
--
a
dull
,
*NL*
obstinate
,
narrow-minded
old
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
you
're
at
all
dull
,
''
Isabel
had
replied
to
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
think
I
'm
obstinate
and
narrow-minded
?
I
told
you
so
!
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
with
much
elation
at
being
justified
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
remained
for
the
present
with
her
aunt
,
because
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
eccentric
impulses
,
she
had
a
great
regard
for
what
was
usually
deemed
*NL*
decent
,
and
a
young
gentlewoman
without
visible
relations
had
always
*NL*
struck
her
as
a
flower
without
foliage
.
It
was
true
that
Mrs.
Touchett
's
*NL*
conversation
had
never
again
appeared
so
brilliant
as
that
first
*NL*
afternoon
in
Albany
,
when
she
sat
in
her
damp
waterproof
and
sketched
*NL*
the
opportunities
that
Europe
would
offer
to
a
young
person
of
taste
.
*NL*
This
,
however
,
was
in
a
great
measure
the
girl
's
own
fault
;
she
had
*NL*
got
a
glimpse
of
her
aunt
's
experience
,
and
her
imagination
constantly
*NL*
anticipated
the
judgements
and
emotions
of
a
woman
who
had
very
little
*NL*
of
the
same
faculty
.
Apart
from
this
,
Mrs.
Touchett
had
a
great
merit
;
*NL*
she
was
as
honest
as
a
pair
of
compasses
.
There
was
a
comfort
in
her
*NL*
stiffness
and
firmness
;
you
knew
exactly
where
to
find
her
and
were
*NL*
never
liable
to
chance
encounters
and
concussions
.
On
her
own
ground
*NL*
she
was
perfectly
present
,
but
was
never
over-inquisitive
as
regards
*NL*
the
territory
of
her
neighbour
.
Isabel
came
at
last
to
have
a
kind
of
*NL*
undemonstrable
pity
for
her
;
there
seemed
something
so
dreary
in
*NL*
the
condition
of
a
person
whose
nature
had
,
as
it
were
,
so
little
*NL*
surface
--
offered
so
limited
a
face
to
the
accretions
of
human
contact
.
*NL*
Nothing
tender
,
nothing
sympathetic
,
had
ever
had
a
chance
to
fasten
*NL*
upon
it
--
no
wind-sown
blossom
,
no
familiar
softening
moss
.
Her
offered
,
*NL*
her
passive
extent
,
in
other
words
,
was
about
that
of
a
knife-edge
.
*NL*
Isabel
had
reason
to
believe
none
the
less
that
as
she
advanced
in
life
*NL*
she
made
more
of
those
concessions
to
the
sense
of
something
obscurely
*NL*
distinct
from
convenience
--
more
of
them
than
she
independently
exacted
.
*NL*
She
was
learning
to
sacrifice
consistency
to
considerations
of
that
*NL*
inferior
order
for
which
the
excuse
must
be
found
in
the
particular
*NL*
case
.
It
was
not
to
the
credit
of
her
absolute
rectitude
that
she
should
*NL*
have
gone
the
longest
way
round
to
Florence
in
order
to
spend
a
few
*NL*
weeks
with
her
invalid
son
;
since
in
former
years
it
had
been
one
of
her
*NL*
most
definite
convictions
that
when
Ralph
wished
to
see
her
he
was
at
*NL*
liberty
to
remember
that
Palazzo
Crescentini
contained
a
large
apartment
*NL*
known
as
the
quarter
of
the
signorino
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
ask
you
something
,
''
Isabel
said
to
this
young
man
the
day
*NL*
after
her
arrival
at
San
Remo
--
``
something
I
've
thought
more
than
once
*NL*
of
asking
you
by
letter
,
but
that
I
've
hesitated
on
the
whole
to
write
*NL*
about
.
Face
to
face
,
nevertheless
,
my
question
seems
easy
enough
.
Did
*NL*
you
know
your
father
intended
to
leave
me
so
much
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
stretched
his
legs
a
little
further
than
usual
and
gazed
a
little
*NL*
more
fixedly
at
the
Mediterranean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
matter
,
my
dear
Isabel
,
whether
I
knew
?
My
father
was
very
*NL*
obstinate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
said
the
girl
,
``
you
did
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
told
me
.
We
even
talked
it
over
a
little
.
''
``
What
did
he
do
it
*NL*
for
?
''
asked
Isabel
abruptly
.
``
Why
,
as
a
kind
of
compliment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
compliment
on
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
your
so
beautifully
existing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
liked
me
too
much
,
''
she
presently
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
way
we
all
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
believed
that
I
should
be
very
unhappy
.
Fortunately
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
it
.
I
want
to
be
treated
with
justice
;
I
want
nothing
but
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
.
But
you
must
remember
that
justice
to
a
lovely
being
is
*NL*
after
all
a
florid
sort
of
sentiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
a
lovely
being
.
How
can
you
say
that
,
at
the
very
moment
when
*NL*
I
'm
asking
such
odious
questions
?
I
must
seem
to
you
delicate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
me
troubled
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
troubled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
she
answered
nothing
;
then
she
broke
out
:
``
Do
you
think
it
*NL*
good
for
me
suddenly
to
be
made
so
rich
?
Henrietta
does
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hang
Henrietta
!
''
said
Ralph
coarsely
,
``
If
you
ask
me
I
'm
delighted
*NL*
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
why
your
father
did
it
--
for
your
amusement
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
differ
with
Miss
Stackpole
,
''
Ralph
went
on
more
gravely
.
``
I
think
it
*NL*
very
good
for
you
to
have
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
looked
at
him
with
serious
eyes
.
``
I
wonder
whether
you
know
*NL*
what
's
good
for
me
--
or
whether
you
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
know
depend
upon
it
I
care

Shall
I
tell
you
what
it
is
?
Not
to
*NL*
torment
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
torment
you
,
I
suppose
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
do
that
;
I
'm
proof

Take
things
more
easily
.
Do
n't
ask
*NL*
yourself
so
much
whether
this
or
that
is
good
for
you
.
Do
n't
question
*NL*
your
conscience
so
much
--
it
will
get
out
of
tune
like
a
strummed
*NL*
piano
.
Keep
it
for
great
occasions
.
Do
n't
try
so
much
to
form
your
*NL*
character

it
's
like
trying
to
pull
open
a
tight
,
tender
young
rose
.
*NL*
Live
as
you
like
best
,
and
your
character
will
take
care
of
itself
.
Most
*NL*
things
are
good
for
you
;
the
exceptions
are
very
rare
,
and
a
comfortable
*NL*
income
's
not
one
of
them
.
''
Ralph
paused
,
smiling
;
Isabel
had
listened
*NL*
quickly
.
``
You
've
too
much
power
of
thought
--
above
all
too
much
*NL*
conscience
,
''
Ralph
added
.
``
It
's
out
of
all
reason
,
the
number
of
things
*NL*
you
think
wrong
.
Put
back
your
watch
.
Diet
your
fever
.
Spread
your
*NL*
wings
;
rise
above
the
ground
.
It
's
never
wrong
to
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
listened
eagerly
,
as
I
say
;
and
it
was
her
nature
to
understand
*NL*
quickly
.
``
I
wonder
if
you
appreciate
what
you
say
.
If
you
do
,
you
take
a
*NL*
great
responsibility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
frighten
me
a
little
,
but
I
think
I
'm
right
,
''
said
Ralph
,
*NL*
persisting
in
cheer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
what
you
say
is
very
true
,
''
Isabel
pursued
.
``
You
could
say
*NL*
nothing
more
true
.
I
'm
absorbed
in
myself
--
I
look
at
life
too
much
as
*NL*
a
doctor
's
prescription
.
Why
indeed
should
we
perpetually
be
thinking
*NL*
whether
things
are
good
for
us
,
as
if
we
were
patients
lying
in
a
*NL*
hospital
?
Why
should
I
be
so
afraid
of
not
doing
right
?
As
if
it
*NL*
mattered
to
the
world
whether
I
do
right
or
wrong
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
capital
person
to
advise
,
''
said
Ralph
;
``
you
take
the
wind
out
*NL*
of
my
sails
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
as
if
she
had
not
heard
him
--
though
she
was
following
*NL*
out
the
train
of
reflexion
which
he
himself
had
kindled
.
``
I
try
to
*NL*
care
more
about
the
world
than
about
myself
--
but
I
always
come
back
to
*NL*
myself
.
It
's
because
I
'm
afraid
.
''
She
stopped
;
her
voice
had
trembled
*NL*
a
little
.
``
Yes
,
I
'm
afraid
;
I
ca
n't
tell
you
.
A
large
fortune
means
*NL*
freedom
,
and
I
'm
afraid
of
that
.
It
's
such
a
fine
thing
,
and
one
should
*NL*
make
such
a
good
use
of
it
.
If
one
should
n't
one
would
be
ashamed
.
And
*NL*
one
must
keep
thinking
;
it
's
a
constant
effort
.
I
'm
not
sure
it
's
not
a
*NL*
greater
happiness
to
be
powerless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
weak
people
I
've
no
doubt
it
's
a
greater
happiness
.
For
weak
people
*NL*
the
effort
not
to
be
contemptible
must
be
great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
know
I
'm
not
weak
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
Ralph
answered
with
a
flush
that
the
girl
noticed
,
``
if
you
are
I
'm
*NL*
awfully
sold
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
charm
of
the
Mediterranean
coast
only
deepened
for
our
heroine
*NL*
on
acquaintance
,
for
it
was
the
threshold
of
Italy
,
the
gate
of
*NL*
admirations
.
Italy
,
as
yet
imperfectly
seen
and
felt
,
stretched
before
*NL*
her
as
a
land
of
promise
,
a
land
in
which
a
love
of
the
beautiful
might
*NL*
be
comforted
by
endless
knowledge
.
Whenever
she
strolled
upon
the
shore
*NL*
with
her
cousin
--
and
she
was
the
companion
of
his
daily
walk
--
she
looked
*NL*
across
the
sea
,
with
longing
eyes
,
to
where
she
knew
that
Genoa
lay
.
She
*NL*
was
glad
to
pause
,
however
,
on
the
edge
of
this
larger
adventure
;
there
*NL*
was
such
a
thrill
even
in
the
preliminary
hovering
.
It
affected
her
*NL*
moreover
as
a
peaceful
interlude
,
as
a
hush
of
the
drum
and
fife
in
a
*NL*
career
which
she
had
little
warrant
as
yet
for
regarding
as
agitated
,
*NL*
but
which
nevertheless
she
was
constantly
picturing
to
herself
by
*NL*
the
light
of
her
hopes
,
her
fears
,
her
fancies
,
her
ambitions
,
her
*NL*
predilections
,
and
which
reflected
these
subjective
accidents
in
*NL*
a
manner
sufficiently
dramatic
.
Madame
Merle
had
predicted
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
that
after
their
young
friend
had
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
*NL*
half
a
dozen
times
she
would
be
reconciled
to
the
idea
that
it
had
been
*NL*
filled
by
a
munificent
uncle
;
and
the
event
justified
,
as
it
had
so
*NL*
often
justified
before
,
that
lady
's
perspicacity
.
Ralph
Touchett
had
*NL*
praised
his
cousin
for
being
morally
inflammable
,
that
is
for
being
*NL*
quick
to
take
a
hint
that
was
meant
as
good
advice
.
His
advice
had
*NL*
perhaps
helped
the
matter
;
she
had
at
any
rate
before
leaving
San
Remo
*NL*
grown
used
to
feeling
rich
.
The
consciousness
in
question
found
a
*NL*
proper
place
in
rather
a
dense
little
group
of
ideas
that
she
had
about
*NL*
herself
,
and
often
it
was
by
no
means
the
least
agreeable
.
It
took
*NL*
perpetually
for
granted
a
thousand
good
intentions
.
She
lost
herself
in
*NL*
a
maze
of
visions
;
the
fine
things
to
be
done
by
a
rich
,
independent
,
*NL*
generous
girl
who
took
a
large
human
view
of
occasions
and
obligations
*NL*
were
sublime
in
the
mass
.
Her
fortune
therefore
became
to
her
mind
a
*NL*
part
of
her
better
self
;
it
gave
her
importance
,
gave
her
even
,
to
her
*NL*
own
imagination
,
a
certain
ideal
beauty
.
What
it
did
for
her
in
the
*NL*
imagination
of
others
is
another
affair
,
and
on
this
point
we
must
also
*NL*
touch
in
time
.
The
visions
I
have
just
spoken
of
were
mixed
with
other
*NL*
debates
.
Isabel
liked
better
to
think
of
the
future
than
of
the
past
;
*NL*
but
at
times
,
as
she
listened
to
the
murmur
of
the
Mediterranean
waves
,
*NL*
her
glance
took
a
backward
flight
.
It
rested
upon
two
figures
which
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
increasing
distance
,
were
still
sufficiently
salient
;
they
were
*NL*
recognisable
without
difficulty
as
those
of
Caspar
Goodwood
and
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
.
It
was
strange
how
quickly
these
images
of
energy
had
fallen
*NL*
into
the
background
of
our
young
lady
's
life
.
It
was
in
her
disposition
*NL*
at
all
times
to
lose
faith
in
the
reality
of
absent
things
;
she
could
*NL*
summon
back
her
faith
,
in
case
of
need
,
with
an
effort
,
but
the
effort
*NL*
was
often
painful
even
when
the
reality
had
been
pleasant
.
The
past
was
*NL*
apt
to
look
dead
and
its
revival
rather
to
show
the
livid
light
of
a
*NL*
judgement-day
.
The
girl
moreover
was
not
prone
to
take
for
granted
that
*NL*
she
herself
lived
in
the
mind
of
others
--
she
had
not
the
fatuity
to
*NL*
believe
she
left
indelible
traces
.
She
was
capable
of
being
wounded
by
*NL*
the
discovery
that
she
had
been
forgotten
;
but
of
all
liberties
the
one
*NL*
she
herself
found
sweetest
was
the
liberty
to
forget
.
She
had
not
given
*NL*
her
last
shilling
,
sentimentally
speaking
,
either
to
Caspar
Goodwood
or
*NL*
to
Lord
Warburton
,
and
yet
could
n't
but
feel
them
appreciably
in
debt
*NL*
to
her
.
She
had
of
course
reminded
herself
that
she
was
to
hear
from
Mr.
*NL*
Goodwood
again
;
but
this
was
not
to
be
for
another
year
and
a
half
,
and
*NL*
in
that
time
a
great
many
things
might
happen
.
She
had
indeed
failed
to
*NL*
say
to
herself
that
her
American
suitor
might
find
some
other
girl
more
*NL*
comfortable
to
woo
;
because
,
though
it
was
certain
many
other
girls
*NL*
would
prove
so
,
she
had
not
the
smallest
belief
that
this
merit
*NL*
would
attract
him
.
But
she
reflected
that
she
herself
might
know
the
*NL*
humiliation
of
change
,
might
really
,
for
that
matter
,
come
to
the
end
of
*NL*
the
things
that
were
not
Caspar
-LRB-
even
though
there
appeared
so
many
of
*NL*
them
-RRB-
,
and
find
rest
in
those
very
elements
of
his
presence
which
struck
*NL*
her
now
as
impediments
to
the
finer
respiration
.
It
was
conceivable
*NL*
that
these
impediments
should
some
day
prove
a
sort
of
blessing
*NL*
in
disguise
--
a
clear
and
quiet
harbour
enclosed
by
a
brave
granite
*NL*
breakwater
.
But
that
day
could
only
come
in
its
order
,
and
she
could
n't
*NL*
wait
for
it
with
folded
hands
.
That
Lord
Warburton
should
continue
*NL*
to
cherish
her
image
seemed
to
her
more
than
a
noble
humility
or
an
*NL*
enlightened
pride
ought
to
wish
to
reckon
with
.
She
had
so
definitely
*NL*
undertaken
to
preserve
no
record
of
what
had
passed
between
them
that
a
*NL*
corresponding
effort
on
his
own
part
would
be
eminently
just
.
This
*NL*
was
not
,
as
it
may
seem
,
merely
a
theory
tinged
with
sarcasm
.
Isabel
*NL*
candidly
believed
that
his
lordship
would
,
in
the
usual
phrase
,
get
over
*NL*
his
disappointment
.
He
had
been
deeply
affected
--
this
she
believed
,
and
*NL*
she
was
still
capable
of
deriving
pleasure
from
the
belief
;
but
it
*NL*
was
absurd
that
a
man
both
so
intelligent
and
so
honourably
dealt
with
*NL*
should
cultivate
a
scar
out
of
proportion
to
any
wound
.
Englishmen
*NL*
liked
moreover
to
be
comfortable
,
said
Isabel
,
and
there
could
be
*NL*
little
comfort
for
Lord
Warburton
,
in
the
long
run
,
in
brooding
over
a
*NL*
self-sufficient
American
girl
who
had
been
but
a
casual
acquaintance
.
*NL*
She
flattered
herself
that
,
should
she
hear
from
one
day
to
another
that
*NL*
he
had
married
some
young
woman
of
his
own
country
who
had
done
more
*NL*
to
deserve
him
,
she
should
receive
the
news
without
a
pang
even
of
*NL*
surprise
.
It
would
have
proved
that
he
believed
she
was
firm
--
which
was
*NL*
what
she
wished
to
seem
to
him
.
That
alone
was
grateful
to
her
pride
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
the
first
days
of
May
,
some
six
months
after
old
Mr.
*NL*
Touchett
's
death
,
a
small
group
that
might
have
been
described
by
a
*NL*
painter
as
composing
well
was
gathered
in
one
of
the
many
rooms
of
an
*NL*
ancient
villa
crowning
an
olive-muffled
hill
outside
of
the
Roman
gate
*NL*
of
Florence
.
The
villa
was
a
long
,
rather
blank-looking
structure
,
with
*NL*
the
far-projecting
roof
which
Tuscany
loves
and
which
,
on
the
hills
that
*NL*
encircle
Florence
,
when
considered
from
a
distance
,
makes
so
harmonious
*NL*
a
rectangle
with
the
straight
,
dark
,
definite
cypresses
that
usually
*NL*
rise
in
groups
of
three
or
four
beside
it
.
The
house
had
a
front
upon
*NL*
a
little
grassy
,
empty
,
rural
piazza
which
occupied
a
part
of
the
*NL*
hill-top
;
and
this
front
,
pierced
with
a
few
windows
in
irregular
*NL*
relations
and
furnished
with
a
stone
bench
lengthily
adjusted
to
the
*NL*
base
of
the
structure
and
useful
as
a
lounging-place
to
one
or
two
*NL*
persons
wearing
more
or
less
of
that
air
of
undervalued
merit
which
in
*NL*
Italy
,
for
some
reason
or
other
,
always
gracefully
invests
any
one
who
*NL*
confidently
assumes
a
perfectly
passive
attitude
--
this
antique
,
*NL*
solid
,
weather-worn
,
yet
imposing
front
had
a
somewhat
incommunicative
*NL*
character
.
It
was
the
mask
,
not
the
face
of
the
house
.
It
had
heavy
*NL*
lids
,
but
no
eyes
;
the
house
in
reality
looked
another
way
--
looked
off
*NL*
behind
,
into
splendid
openness
and
the
range
of
the
afternoon
light
.
*NL*
In
that
quarter
the
villa
overhung
the
slope
of
its
hill
and
the
long
*NL*
valley
of
the
Arno
,
hazy
with
Italian
colour
.
It
had
a
narrow
garden
,
in
*NL*
the
manner
of
a
terrace
,
productive
chiefly
of
tangles
of
wild
roses
*NL*
and
other
old
stone
benches
,
mossy
and
sun-warmed
.
The
parapet
of
the
*NL*
terrace
was
just
the
height
to
lean
upon
,
and
beneath
it
the
ground
*NL*
declined
into
the
vagueness
of
olive-crops
and
vineyards
.
It
is
not
,
*NL*
however
,
with
the
outside
of
the
place
that
we
are
concerned
;
on
this
*NL*
bright
morning
of
ripened
spring
its
tenants
had
reason
to
prefer
the
*NL*
shady
side
of
the
wall
.
The
windows
of
the
ground-floor
,
as
you
saw
*NL*
them
from
the
piazza
,
were
,
in
their
noble
proportions
,
extremely
*NL*
architectural
;
but
their
function
seemed
less
to
offer
communication
*NL*
with
the
world
than
to
defy
the
world
to
look
in
.
They
were
massively
*NL*
cross-barred
,
and
placed
at
such
a
height
that
curiosity
,
even
on
*NL*
tiptoe
,
expired
before
it
reached
them
.
In
an
apartment
lighted
by
a
*NL*
row
of
three
of
these
jealous
apertures
--
one
of
the
several
distinct
*NL*
apartments
into
which
the
villa
was
divided
and
which
were
mainly
*NL*
occupied
by
foreigners
of
random
race
long
resident
in
Florence
--
a
*NL*
gentleman
was
seated
in
company
with
a
young
girl
and
two
good
sisters
*NL*
from
a
religious
house
.
The
room
was
,
however
,
less
sombre
than
our
*NL*
indications
may
have
represented
,
for
it
had
a
wide
,
high
door
,
which
*NL*
now
stood
open
into
the
tangled
garden
behind
;
and
the
tall
iron
*NL*
lattices
admitted
on
occasion
more
than
enough
of
the
Italian
*NL*
sunshine
.
It
was
moreover
a
seat
of
ease
,
indeed
of
luxury
,
telling
*NL*
of
arrangements
subtly
studied
and
refinements
frankly
proclaimed
,
and
*NL*
containing
a
variety
of
those
faded
hangings
of
damask
and
tapestry
,
*NL*
those
chests
and
cabinets
of
carved
and
time-polished
oak
,
those
angular
*NL*
specimens
of
pictorial
art
in
frames
as
pedantically
primitive
,
those
*NL*
perverse-looking
relics
of
medieval
brass
and
pottery
,
of
which
Italy
*NL*
has
long
been
the
not
quite
exhausted
storehouse
.
These
things
kept
*NL*
terms
with
articles
of
modern
furniture
in
which
large
allowance
had
*NL*
been
made
for
a
lounging
generation
;
it
was
to
be
noticed
that
all
the
*NL*
chairs
were
deep
and
well
padded
and
that
much
space
was
occupied
by
a
*NL*
writing-table
of
which
the
ingenious
perfection
bore
the
stamp
of
London
*NL*
and
the
nineteenth
century
.
There
were
books
in
profusion
and
magazines
*NL*
and
newspapers
,
and
a
few
small
,
odd
,
elaborate
pictures
,
chiefly
in
*NL*
water-colour
.
One
of
these
productions
stood
on
a
drawing-room
easel
*NL*
before
which
,
at
the
moment
we
begin
to
be
concerned
with
her
,
the
young
*NL*
girl
I
have
mentioned
had
placed
herself
.
She
was
looking
at
the
picture
*NL*
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
--
absolute
silence
--
had
not
fallen
upon
her
companions
;
but
their
*NL*
talk
had
an
appearance
of
embarrassed
continuity
.
The
two
good
sisters
*NL*
had
not
settled
themselves
in
their
respective
chairs
;
their
attitude
*NL*
expressed
a
final
reserve
and
their
faces
showed
the
glaze
of
*NL*
prudence
.
They
were
plain
,
ample
,
mild-featured
women
,
with
a
kind
of
*NL*
business-like
modesty
to
which
the
impersonal
aspect
of
their
stiffened
*NL*
linen
and
of
the
serge
that
draped
them
as
if
nailed
on
frames
gave
an
*NL*
advantage
.
One
of
them
,
a
person
of
a
certain
age
,
in
spectacles
,
with
a
*NL*
fresh
complexion
and
a
full
cheek
,
had
a
more
discriminating
manner
*NL*
than
her
colleague
,
as
well
as
the
responsibility
of
their
errand
,
which
*NL*
apparently
related
to
the
young
girl
.
This
object
of
interest
wore
her
*NL*
hat
--
an
ornament
of
extreme
simplicity
and
not
at
variance
with
her
*NL*
plain
muslin
gown
,
too
short
for
her
years
,
though
it
must
already
*NL*
have
been
``
let
out
.
''
The
gentleman
who
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
*NL*
entertaining
the
two
nuns
was
perhaps
conscious
of
the
difficulties
of
*NL*
his
function
,
it
being
in
its
way
as
arduous
to
converse
with
the
very
*NL*
meek
as
with
the
very
mighty
.
At
the
same
time
he
was
clearly
much
*NL*
occupied
with
their
quiet
charge
,
and
while
she
turned
her
back
to
*NL*
him
his
eyes
rested
gravely
on
her
slim
,
small
figure
.
He
was
a
man
of
*NL*
forty
,
with
a
high
but
well-shaped
head
,
on
which
the
hair
,
still
dense
,
*NL*
but
prematurely
grizzled
,
had
been
cropped
close
.
He
had
a
fine
,
narrow
,
*NL*
extremely
modelled
and
composed
face
,
of
which
the
only
fault
was
just
*NL*
this
effect
of
its
running
a
trifle
too
much
to
points
;
an
appearance
to
*NL*
which
the
shape
of
the
beard
contributed
not
a
little
.
This
beard
,
cut
*NL*
in
the
manner
of
the
portraits
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
surmounted
*NL*
by
a
fair
moustache
,
of
which
the
ends
had
a
romantic
upward
flourish
,
*NL*
gave
its
wearer
a
foreign
,
traditionary
look
and
suggested
that
he
was
a
*NL*
gentleman
who
studied
style
.
His
conscious
,
curious
eyes
,
however
,
eyes
*NL*
at
once
vague
and
penetrating
,
intelligent
and
hard
,
expressive
of
*NL*
the
observer
as
well
as
of
the
dreamer
,
would
have
assured
you
that
*NL*
he
studied
it
only
within
well-chosen
limits
,
and
that
in
so
far
as
he
*NL*
sought
it
he
found
it
.
You
would
have
been
much
at
a
loss
to
determine
*NL*
his
original
clime
and
country
;
he
had
none
of
the
superficial
signs
*NL*
that
usually
render
the
answer
to
this
question
an
insipidly
easy
one
.
*NL*
If
he
had
English
blood
in
his
veins
it
had
probably
received
some
*NL*
French
or
Italian
commixture
;
but
he
suggested
,
fine
gold
coin
as
he
*NL*
was
,
no
stamp
nor
emblem
of
the
common
mintage
that
provides
for
general
*NL*
circulation
;
he
was
the
elegant
complicated
medal
struck
off
for
a
*NL*
special
occasion
.
He
had
a
light
,
lean
,
rather
languid-looking
figure
,
*NL*
and
was
apparently
neither
tall
nor
short
.
He
was
dressed
as
a
man
*NL*
dresses
who
takes
little
other
trouble
about
it
than
to
have
no
vulgar
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
''
he
asked
of
the
young
girl
.
He
*NL*
used
the
Italian
tongue
,
and
used
it
with
perfect
ease
;
but
this
would
*NL*
not
have
convinced
you
he
was
Italian
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
turned
her
head
earnestly
to
one
side
and
the
other
.
``
It
's
*NL*
very
pretty
,
papa
.
Did
you
make
it
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
made
it
.
Do
n't
you
think
I
'm
clever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
papa
,
very
clever
;
I
also
have
learned
to
make
pictures
.
''
And
*NL*
she
turned
round
and
showed
a
small
,
fair
face
painted
with
a
fixed
and
*NL*
intensely
sweet
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
brought
me
a
specimen
of
your
powers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
brought
a
great
many
;
they
're
in
my
trunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
draws
very
--
very
carefully
,
''
the
elder
of
the
nuns
remarked
,
*NL*
speaking
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
.
Is
it
you
who
have
instructed
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happily
no
,
''
said
the
good
sister
,
blushing
a
little
.
``
Ce
n'est
pas
ma
*NL*
partie
.
I
teach
nothing
;
I
leave
that
to
those
who
are
wiser
.
We
've
an
*NL*
excellent
drawing-master
,
Mr.
--
Mr.
--
what
is
his
name
?
''
she
asked
of
her
*NL*
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
companion
looked
about
at
the
carpet
.
``
It
's
a
German
name
,
''
she
said
*NL*
in
Italian
,
as
if
it
needed
to
be
translated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
the
other
went
on
,
``
he
's
a
German
,
and
we
've
had
him
many
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
,
who
was
not
heeding
the
conversation
,
had
wandered
away
*NL*
to
the
open
door
of
the
large
room
and
stood
looking
into
the
garden
.
*NL*
``
And
you
,
my
sister
,
are
French
,
''
said
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
the
visitor
gently
replied
.
``
I
speak
to
the
pupils
in
my
*NL*
own
tongue
.
I
know
no
other
.
But
we
have
sisters
of
other
*NL*
countries
--
English
,
German
,
Irish
.
They
all
speak
their
proper
*NL*
language
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
gave
a
smile
.
``
Has
my
daughter
been
under
the
care
of
one
*NL*
of
the
Irish
ladies
?
''
And
then
,
as
he
saw
that
his
visitors
suspected
*NL*
a
joke
,
though
failing
to
understand
it
,
``
You
're
very
complete
,
''
he
*NL*
instantly
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
we
're
complete
.
We
've
everything
,
and
everything
's
of
the
*NL*
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
gymnastics
,
''
the
Italian
sister
ventured
to
remark
.
``
But
not
*NL*
dangerous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
.
Is
that
YOUR
branch
?
''
A
question
which
provoked
much
candid
*NL*
hilarity
on
the
part
of
the
two
ladies
;
on
the
subsidence
of
which
their
*NL*
entertainer
,
glancing
at
his
daughter
,
remarked
that
she
had
grown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
think
she
has
finished
.
She
'll
remain
--
not
big
,
''
said
the
*NL*
French
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sorry
.
I
prefer
women
like
books
--
very
good
and
not
too
long
.
*NL*
But
I
know
,
''
the
gentleman
said
,
``
no
particular
reason
why
my
child
*NL*
should
be
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nun
gave
a
temperate
shrug
,
as
if
to
intimate
that
such
things
might
*NL*
be
beyond
our
knowledge
.
``
She
's
in
very
good
health
;
that
's
the
best
*NL*
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
looks
sound
.
''
And
the
young
girl
's
father
watched
her
a
*NL*
moment
.
``
What
do
you
see
in
the
garden
?
''
he
asked
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
many
flowers
,
''
she
replied
in
a
sweet
,
small
voice
and
with
an
*NL*
accent
as
good
as
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
not
many
good
ones
.
However
,
such
as
they
are
,
go
out
and
*NL*
gather
some
for
ces
dames
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
turned
to
him
with
her
smile
heightened
by
pleasure
.
``
May
I
,
*NL*
truly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
when
I
tell
you
,
''
said
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
glanced
at
the
elder
of
the
nuns
.
``
May
I
,
truly
,
ma
mere
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Obey
monsieur
your
father
,
my
child
,
''
said
the
sister
,
blushing
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
,
satisfied
with
this
authorisation
,
descended
from
the
*NL*
threshold
and
was
presently
lost
to
sight
.
``
You
do
n't
spoil
them
,
''
said
*NL*
her
father
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
everything
they
must
ask
leave
.
That
's
our
system
.
Leave
is
freely
*NL*
granted
,
but
they
must
ask
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
quarrel
with
your
system
;
I
've
no
doubt
it
's
excellent
.
I
*NL*
sent
you
my
daughter
to
see
what
you
'd
make
of
her
.
I
had
faith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
must
have
faith
,
''
the
sister
blandly
rejoined
,
gazing
through
her
*NL*
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
has
my
faith
been
rewarded
?
What
have
you
made
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sister
dropped
her
eyes
a
moment
.
``
A
good
Christian
,
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
host
dropped
his
eyes
as
well
;
but
it
was
probable
that
the
movement
*NL*
had
in
each
case
a
different
spring
.
``
Yes
,
and
what
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
the
lady
from
the
convent
,
probably
thinking
she
would
say
*NL*
that
a
good
Christian
was
everything
;
but
for
all
her
simplicity
she
*NL*
was
not
so
crude
as
that
.
``
A
charming
young
lady
--
a
real
little
woman
--
a
*NL*
daughter
in
whom
you
will
have
nothing
but
contentment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
seems
to
me
very
gentille
,
''
said
the
father
.
``
She
's
really
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
perfect
.
She
has
no
faults
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
had
any
as
a
child
,
and
I
'm
glad
you
have
given
her
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
love
her
too
much
,
''
said
the
spectacled
sister
with
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
for
faults
,
how
can
we
give
what
we
have
not
?
Le
couvent
n'est
*NL*
pas
comme
le
monde
,
monsieur
.
She
's
our
daughter
,
as
you
may
say
.
We
've
*NL*
had
her
since
she
was
so
small
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
all
those
we
shall
lose
this
year
she
's
the
one
we
shall
miss
most
,
''
*NL*
the
younger
woman
murmured
deferentially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
we
shall
talk
long
of
her
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
We
shall
hold
her
*NL*
up
to
the
new
ones
.
''
And
at
this
the
good
sister
appeared
to
find
her
*NL*
spectacles
dim
;
while
her
companion
,
after
fumbling
a
moment
,
presently
*NL*
drew
forth
a
pocket-handkerchief
of
durable
texture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
certain
you
'll
lose
her
;
nothing
's
settled
yet
,
''
their
host
*NL*
rejoined
quickly
;
not
as
if
to
anticipate
their
tears
,
but
in
the
tone
*NL*
of
a
man
saying
what
was
most
agreeable
to
himself
.
``
We
should
be
very
*NL*
happy
to
believe
that
.
Fifteen
is
very
young
to
leave
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
exclaimed
the
gentleman
with
more
vivacity
than
he
had
yet
used
,
*NL*
``
it
is
not
I
who
wish
to
take
her
away
.
I
wish
you
could
keep
her
*NL*
always
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
elder
sister
,
smiling
and
getting
up
,
``
good
as
*NL*
she
is
,
she
's
made
for
the
world
.
Le
monde
y
gagnera

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
all
the
good
people
were
hidden
away
in
convents
how
would
the
world
*NL*
get
on
?
''
her
companion
softly
enquired
,
rising
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
question
of
a
wider
bearing
than
the
good
woman
apparently
*NL*
supposed
;
and
the
lady
in
spectacles
took
a
harmonising
view
by
saying
*NL*
comfortably
:
``
Fortunately
there
are
good
people
everywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
're
going
there
will
be
two
less
here
,
''
her
host
remarked
*NL*
gallantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
extravagant
sally
his
simple
visitors
had
no
answer
,
and
they
*NL*
simply
looked
at
each
other
in
decent
deprecation
;
but
their
confusion
*NL*
was
speedily
covered
by
the
return
of
the
young
girl
with
two
large
*NL*
bunches
of
roses
--
one
of
them
all
white
,
the
other
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
your
choice
,
mamman
Catherine
,
''
said
the
child
.
``
It
's
only
*NL*
the
colour
that
's
different

mamman
Justine

there
are
just
as
many
*NL*
roses
in
one
bunch
as
in
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
sisters
turned
to
each
other
,
smiling
and
hesitating
,
with
*NL*
``
Which
will
you
take
?
''
and
``
No
,
it
's
for
you
to
choose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
take
the
red
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Catherine
in
the
spectacles
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
so
red
myself

They
'll
comfort
us
on
our
way
back
to
Rome

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
they
wo

cried
the
young
girl
.
``
I
wish
I
could
give
you
*NL*
something
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
the
child
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
go
back
to
Rome
to-night
?
''
her
father
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

again

so
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
never
tired

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
sister
,
sometimes
,
''
murmured
the
junior
votaress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to-day

at
any

We

well

Que

''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
host
,
while
they
exchanged
kisses
with
his
daughter
,
went
forward
*NL*
to
open
the
door
through
which
they
were
to
pass
;
but
as
he
did
so
he
*NL*
gave
a
slight
exclamation
,
and
stood
looking
beyond
.
The
door
opened
*NL*
into
a
vaulted
ante-chamber
,
as
high
as
a
chapel
and
paved
with
red
*NL*
tiles
;
and
into
this
antechamber
a
lady
had
just
been
admitted
by
a
*NL*
servant
,
a
lad
in
shabby
livery
,
who
was
now
ushering
her
toward
the
*NL*
apartment
in
which
our
friends
were
grouped
.
The
gentleman
at
the
door
,
*NL*
after
dropping
his
exclamation
,
remained
silent
;
in
silence
too
the
lady
*NL*
advanced
.
He
gave
her
no
further
audible
greeting
and
offered
her
no
*NL*
hand
,
but
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
into
the
saloon
.
At
the
threshold
*NL*
she
hesitated
.
``
Is
there
any
one
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
you
may
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
in
and
found
herself
confronted
with
the
two
nuns
and
their
*NL*
pupil
,
who
was
coming
forward
,
between
them
,
with
a
hand
in
the
arm
of
*NL*
each
.
At
the
sight
of
the
new
visitor
they
all
paused
,
and
the
lady
,
who
*NL*
had
also
stopped
,
stood
looking
at
them
.
The
young
girl
gave
a
little
*NL*
soft
cry
:
``
Ah
,
Madame
Merle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
had
been
slightly
startled
,
but
her
manner
the
next
instant
*NL*
was
none
the
less
gracious
.
``
Yes
,
it
's
Madame
Merle
,
come
to
welcome
you
*NL*
home
.
''
And
she
held
out
two
hands
to
the
girl
,
who
immediately
came
up
*NL*
to
her
,
presenting
her
forehead
to
be
kissed
.
Madame
Merle
saluted
this
*NL*
portion
of
her
charming
little
person
and
then
stood
smiling
at
the
two
*NL*
nuns
.
They
acknowledged
her
smile
with
a
decent
obeisance
,
but
permitted
*NL*
themselves
no
direct
scrutiny
of
this
imposing
,
brilliant
woman
,
who
*NL*
seemed
to
bring
in
with
her
something
of
the
radiance
of
the
outer
*NL*
world
.
``
These
ladies
have
brought
my
daughter
home
,
and
now
they
return
*NL*
to
the
convent
,
''
the
gentleman
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
go
back
to
Rome
?
I
've
lately
come
from
there
.
It
's
very
lovely
*NL*
now
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
sisters
,
standing
with
their
hands
folded
into
their
sleeves
,
*NL*
accepted
this
statement
uncritically
;
and
the
master
of
the
house
asked
*NL*
his
new
visitor
how
long
it
was
since
she
had
left
Rome
.
``
She
came
to
*NL*
see
me
at
the
convent
,
''
said
the
young
girl
before
the
lady
addressed
*NL*
had
time
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
more
than
once
,
Pansy
,
''
Madame
Merle
declared
.
``
Am
I
not
your
*NL*
great
friend
in
Rome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
the
last
time
best
,
''
said
Pansy
,
``
because
you
told
me
I
*NL*
should
come
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
tell
her
that
?
''
the
child
's
father
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
remember
.
I
told
her
what
I
thought
would
please
her
.
I
've
*NL*
been
in
Florence
a
week
.
I
hoped
you
would
come
to
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
done
so
if
I
had
known
you
were
there
.
One
does
n't
know
*NL*
such
things
by
inspiration
--
though
I
suppose
one
ought
.
You
had
better
*NL*
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
speeches
were
made
in
a
particular
tone
of
voice
--
a
tone
*NL*
half-lowered
and
carefully
quiet
,
but
as
from
habit
rather
than
from
any
*NL*
definite
need
.
Madame
Merle
looked
about
her
,
choosing
her
seat
.
``
You
're
*NL*
going
to
the
door
with
these
women
?
Let
me
of
course
not
interrupt
the
*NL*
ceremony
.
Je
vous
salue
,
mesdames
,
''
she
added
,
in
French
,
to
the
nuns
,
*NL*
as
if
to
dismiss
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
lady
's
a
great
friend
of
ours
;
you
will
have
seen
her
at
the
*NL*
convent
,
''
said
their
entertainer
.
``
We
've
much
faith
in
her
judgement
,
*NL*
and
she
'll
help
me
to
decide
whether
my
daughter
shall
return
to
you
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
holidays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
'll
decide
in
our
favour
,
madame
,
''
the
sister
in
spectacles
*NL*
ventured
to
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Mr.
Osmond
's
pleasantry
;
I
decide
nothing
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
,
*NL*
but
also
as
in
pleasantry
.
``
I
believe
you
've
a
very
good
school
,
but
*NL*
Miss
Osmond
's
friends
must
remember
that
she
's
very
naturally
meant
for
*NL*
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
've
told
monsieur
,
''
sister
Catherine
answered
.
``
It
's
*NL*
precisely
to
fit
her
for
the
world
,
''
she
murmured
,
glancing
at
Pansy
,
*NL*
who
stood
,
at
a
little
distance
,
attentive
to
Madame
Merle
's
elegant
*NL*
apparel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
that
,
Pansy
?
You
're
very
naturally
meant
for
the
world
,
''
*NL*
said
Pansy
's
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
fixed
him
an
instant
with
her
pure
young
eyes
.
``
Am
I
not
meant
*NL*
for
you
,
papa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Papa
gave
a
quick
,
light
laugh
.
``
That
does
n't
prevent
it
!
I
'm
of
the
*NL*
world
,
Pansy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kindly
permit
us
to
retire
,
''
said
sister
Catherine
.
``
Be
good
and
wise
*NL*
and
happy
in
any
case
,
my
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
certainly
come
back
and
see
you
,
''
Pansy
returned
,
recommencing
*NL*
her
embraces
,
which
were
presently
interrupted
by
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
with
me
,
dear
child
,
''
she
said
,
``
while
your
father
takes
the
good
*NL*
ladies
to
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
stared
,
disappointed
,
yet
not
protesting
.
She
was
evidently
*NL*
impregnated
with
the
idea
of
submission
,
which
was
due
to
any
one
who
*NL*
took
the
tone
of
authority
;
and
she
was
a
passive
spectator
of
the
*NL*
operation
of
her
fate
.
``
May
I
not
see
mamman
Catherine
get
into
the
*NL*
carriage
?
''
she
nevertheless
asked
very
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
please
me
better
if
you
'd
remain
with
me
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
,
*NL*
while
Mr.
Osmond
and
his
companions
,
who
had
bowed
low
again
to
the
*NL*
other
visitor
,
passed
into
the
ante-chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
'll
stay
,
''
Pansy
answered
;
and
she
stood
near
Madame
Merle
,
*NL*
surrendering
her
little
hand
,
which
this
lady
took
.
She
stared
out
of
*NL*
the
window
;
her
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
they
've
taught
you
to
obey
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
.
``
That
's
what
*NL*
good
little
girls
should
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
obey
very
well
,
''
cried
Pansy
with
soft
eagerness
,
almost
with
*NL*
boastfulness
,
as
if
she
had
been
speaking
of
her
piano-playing
.
And
then
*NL*
she
gave
a
faint
,
just
audible
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
,
holding
her
hand
,
drew
it
across
her
own
fine
palm
and
*NL*
looked
at
it
.
The
gaze
was
critical
,
but
it
found
nothing
to
deprecate
;
*NL*
the
child
's
small
hand
was
delicate
and
fair
.
``
I
hope
they
always
see
*NL*
that
you
wear
gloves
,
''
she
said
in
a
moment
.
``
Little
girls
usually
*NL*
dislike
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
dislike
them
,
but
I
like
them
now
,
''
the
child
made
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
I
'll
make
you
a
present
of
a
dozen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
very
much
.
What
colours
will
they
be
?
''
Pansy
demanded
with
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
meditated
.
``
Useful
colours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
very
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
very
fond
of
pretty
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
--
but
not
too
fond
,
''
said
Pansy
with
a
trace
of
asceticism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
wo
n't
be
too
pretty
,
''
Madame
Merle
returned
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
She
took
the
child
's
other
hand
and
drew
her
nearer
;
after
which
,
*NL*
looking
at
her
a
moment
,
``
Shall
you
miss
mother
Catherine
?
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
when
I
think
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
then
not
to
think
of
her
.
Perhaps
some
day
,
''
added
Madame
Merle
,
*NL*
``
you
'll
have
another
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
that
's
necessary
,
''
Pansy
said
,
repeating
her
little
soft
*NL*
conciliatory
sigh
.
``
I
had
more
than
thirty
mothers
at
the
convent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
's
step
sounded
again
in
the
antechamber
,
and
Madame
Merle
got
*NL*
up
,
releasing
the
child
.
Mr.
Osmond
came
in
and
closed
the
door
;
then
,
*NL*
without
looking
at
Madame
Merle
,
he
pushed
one
or
two
chairs
back
into
*NL*
their
places
.
His
visitor
waited
a
moment
for
him
to
speak
,
watching
him
*NL*
as
he
moved
about
.
Then
at
last
she
said
:
``
I
hoped
you
'd
have
come
to
*NL*
Rome
.
I
thought
it
possible
you
'd
have
wished
yourself
to
fetch
Pansy
*NL*
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
a
natural
supposition
;
but
I
'm
afraid
it
's
not
the
first
time
*NL*
I
've
acted
in
defiance
of
your
calculations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
,
``
I
think
you
very
perverse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Osmond
busied
himself
for
a
moment
in
the
room
--
there
was
plenty
of
*NL*
space
in
it
to
move
about
--
in
the
fashion
of
a
man
mechanically
*NL*
seeking
pretexts
for
not
giving
an
attention
which
may
be
embarrassing
.
*NL*
Presently
,
however
,
he
had
exhausted
his
pretexts
;
there
was
nothing
*NL*
left
for
him
--
unless
he
took
up
a
book
--
but
to
stand
with
his
hands
*NL*
behind
him
looking
at
Pansy
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
come
and
see
the
last
of
*NL*
mamman
Catherine
?
''
he
asked
of
her
abruptly
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
hesitated
a
moment
,
glancing
at
Madame
Merle
.
``
I
asked
her
to
stay
*NL*
with
me
,
''
said
this
lady
,
who
had
seated
herself
again
in
another
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
was
better
,
''
Osmond
conceded
.
With
which
he
dropped
into
a
*NL*
chair
and
sat
looking
at
Madame
Merle
;
bent
forward
a
little
,
his
elbows
*NL*
on
the
edge
of
the
arms
and
his
hands
interlocked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
going
to
give
me
some
gloves
,
''
said
Pansy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
tell
that
to
every
one
,
my
dear
,
''
Madame
Merle
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
kind
to
her
,
''
said
Osmond
.
``
She
's
supposed
to
have
*NL*
everything
she
needs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
she
had
had
enough
of
the
nuns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
're
going
to
discuss
that
matter
she
had
better
go
out
of
the
*NL*
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
stay
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
.
``
We
'll
talk
of
something
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
like
I
wo
n't
listen
,
''
Pansy
suggested
with
an
appearance
of
*NL*
candour
which
imposed
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
listen
,
charming
child
,
because
you
wo
n't
understand
,
''
her
*NL*
father
replied
.
The
child
sat
down
,
deferentially
,
near
the
open
door
,
*NL*
within
sight
of
the
garden
,
into
which
she
directed
her
innocent
,
*NL*
wistful
eyes
;
and
Mr.
Osmond
went
on
irrelevantly
,
addressing
himself
to
*NL*
his
other
companion
.
``
You
're
looking
particularly
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
always
look
the
same
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
ARE
the
same

You
do
n't
vary

You
're
a
wonderful
woman

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sometimes
change
your
mind
,
however
.
You
told
me
on
your
return
*NL*
from
England
that
you
would
n't
leave
Rome
again
for
the
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
pleased
that
you
remember
so
well
what
I
say

That
was
my
*NL*
intention

But
I
've
come
to
Florence
to
meet
some
friends
who
have
*NL*
lately
arrived
and
as
to
whose
movements
I
was
at
that
time
uncertain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
reason
's
characteristic
.
You
're
always
doing
something
for
your
*NL*
friends

''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
smiled
straight
at
her
host
.
``
It
's
less
characteristic
than
*NL*
your
comment
upon
it
which
is
perfectly
insincere
.
I
do
n't
,
however
,
*NL*
make
a
crime
of
that

she
added
,
``
because
if

believe
what

you

there
's
no
reason

I
do

ruin
myself

I
do

care
greatly
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
;
but
yourself
includes
so
many
other
selves

so
much
of
every

one
else

I
never
knew
a
person
whose
life
touched
so
*NL*
many
other
lives

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call
one

asked
Madame

.
``
One

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
call
YOUR

your
ambitions

said
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
looked
a
moment
at
Pansy
.
``
I
wonder
if
she
understands
*NL*
that
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
she
ca
n't
stay
with
us
!
''
And
Pansy
's
father
gave
rather
a
*NL*
joyless
smile
.
``
Go
into
the
garden
,
mignonne
,
and
pluck
a
flower
or
two
*NL*
for
Madame
Merle

he
went
on
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
wanted
to
do
,
''
Pansy
exclaimed
,
rising
with
*NL*
promptness
and
noiselessly
departing
.
Her
father
followed
her
to
the
*NL*
open
door
,
stood
a
moment
watching
her
,
and
then
came
back
,
but
remained
*NL*
standing
,
or
rather
strolling
to
and
fro
,
as
if
to
cultivate
a
sense
of
*NL*
freedom
which
in
another
attitude
might
be
wanting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
ambitions
are
principally
for
you

said
Madame
Merle
,
looking
up
at
*NL*
him
with
a
certain
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
comes
back
to
what

sort
of
a
fault
do
you
call
that
?
*NL*
My
indolence
,
at
any
rate
,
was
one
of
the
reasons
I
did
n't
go
to
Rome
.
*NL*
But
it
was
only
one
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
of
importance

to
me
at

--
that
you
did
n't
go

though
I
*NL*
should
have
been
glad
to
see
you

I
'm
glad
you
're
not
in
Rome
now
--
which
*NL*
you
might
be

would
probably
be
,
if
you
had
gone
there
a
month
ago
.
*NL*
There
's
something
I
should
like
you
to
do
at
present
in
Florence
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
remember
my
indolence

said
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
remember
it

but
I
beg
you
to
forget
it

In
that
way
you
'll
have
*NL*
both
the
virtue
and
the
reward
.
This
is
not
a
great
labour
,
and
it
*NL*
may
prove
a
real
interest

How
long
is
it

you
made
a

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Osmond
,
in
his
walk
,
had
gone
back
to
the
open
door
again
and
was
*NL*
looking
at
his
daughter
as
she
moved
about
in
the
intense
sunshine
.
*NL*
``
What
good
will
it
do
me
?
''
he
asked
with
a
sort
of
genial
crudity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
waited
.
``
It
will
amuse
you
.
''
There
was
nothing
crude
in
*NL*
this
rejoinder
;
it
had
been
thoroughly
well
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
say
that
,
you
know

I
believe
it

said
Osmond
,
coming
toward
*NL*
her
.
``
There
are
some
points
in
which
my
confidence

complete

*NL*
I
'm
perfectly
aware

that
you

*NL*

all

You
've
gained
it
in
the
right

*NL*
Madame

flushed
as
with
a
wounded
intention
.
``
Do

*NL*

for
the

several

struck
up

on

of
a

who

*NL*
``

she

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

listened
to
this
in
silence
,
appearing
to
turn
it
over
in
his
*NL*
mind
with
his
eyes
on
his
informant
.
``
What
do
you
want
to
do
with

he
asked
at

*NL*
*NL*
``

see

Put
her
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
she
meant
for
something
better

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
what
people
are
meant

said
Madame

.
*NL*
``
I
only
know
what
I
can
do
with
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
for
Miss
Archer
!
''
Osmond
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
got
up
.
``
If
that
's
a
beginning
of
interest
in
her
I
take
*NL*
note
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
stood
there
face
to
face
;
she
settled
her
mantilla
,
looking
down
*NL*
at
it
as
she
did
so
.
``
You
're
looking
very
well
,
''
Osmond
repeated
still
*NL*
less
relevantly
than
before
.
``
You
have
some
idea
.
You
're
never
so
well
*NL*
as
when
you
've
got
an
idea
;
they
're
always
becoming
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
manner
and
tone
of
these
two
persons
,
on
first
meeting
at
any
*NL*
juncture
,
and
especially
when
they
met
in
the
presence
of
others
,
was
*NL*
something
indirect
and
circumspect
,
as
if
they
had
approached
each
other
*NL*
obliquely
and
addressed
each
other
by
implication
.
The
effect
of
*NL*
each
appeared
to
be
to
intensify
to
an
appreciable
degree
the
*NL*
self-consciousness
of
the
other
.
Madame
Merle
of
course
carried
off
any
*NL*
embarrassment
better
than
her
friend
;
but
even
Madame
Merle
had
not
*NL*
on
this
occasion
the
form
she
would
have
liked
to
have
--
the
perfect
*NL*
self-possession
she
would
have
wished
to
wear
for
her
host
.
The
point
to
*NL*
be
made
is
,
however
,
that
at
a
certain
moment
the
element
between
them
,
*NL*
whatever
it
was
,
always
levelled
itself
and
left
them
more
closely
*NL*
face
to
face
than
either
ever
was
with
any
one
else
.
This
was
what
had
*NL*
happened
now
.
They
stood
there
knowing
each
other
well
and
each
on
the
*NL*
whole
willing
to
accept
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
as
a
compensation
*NL*
for
the
inconvenience
--
whatever
it
might
be
--
of
being
known
.
``
I
wish
*NL*
very
much
you
were
not
so
heartless
,
''
Madame
Merle
quietly
said
.
``
It
has
*NL*
always
been
against
you
,
and
it
will
be
against
you
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
so
heartless
as
you
think

Every
now

then
something
touches

me

for
instance
your
saying
just
now
that
your
ambitions
are
for
*NL*
me

I
do
n't
understand
it

I
do

see
how

why
they
should
be

it
*NL*
touches
me

all
the

.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
probably
understand
it
even
less

goes
on

are
some

things

never
understand

There
's
no
particular
need

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
after
all
,
are
the
most
remarkable
of
women

said
Osmond
.
``
You
*NL*
have
more
in
you

almost
any
one

I
do

Touchett
's
niece

matter
very
much
to
me

when

But
he
*NL*
paused
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
myself
have
mattered
so
little
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
of

is
not
what

appreciated

a
woman
as
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabel
Archer
's
better
than
I

said
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
companion
gave
a
laugh
.
``
How
little
you
must
think
of
her

say
*NL*
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you

me
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
With

to
me

No

on
the
whole
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``

two
days
hence

Palazzo
Crescentini

girl
will
be
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
ask
me
that
at
first
simply
,
without
speaking
of
the
*NL*
girl

said
Osmond
.
``
You
could
have
had
her
there
at
any
rate

*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
looked
at
him
in
the
manner
of
a
woman
whom
no
question
he
*NL*
could
ever
put
would
find
unprepared
.
``
Do
you
wish
to
know
why

Because
*NL*
I
've
spoken
of
you
to
her

*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
frowned
and
turned
away
.
``
I
'd
rather
not
know
that
.
''
Then
in
*NL*
a
moment
he
pointed
out
the
easel
supporting
the
little
water-colour
*NL*
drawing
.
``
Have
you
seen
what
's
there
--
my
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
drew
near
and
considered
.
``
Is
it
the
Venetian
Alps

one
of
*NL*
your
last
year

sketches

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

how
you
guess
everything

*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
a
moment
longer
,
then
turned
away
.
``
You
know
I
do
n't
care

*NL*
*NL*
``

Madame

And
then
in
quite
a

different
tone
:
``
In
itself

little
picture

very
good

She
looked

about
the
room

at

old
cabinets

pictures

tapestries

surfaces
*NL*
of
faded
silk

``
Your

afresh

*NL*

*NL*
``

Mr.

,
in

simply
looked
at

more
attentive

*NL*
Madame
Merle
was
silent
a
little
.
``
I
want
you

*NL*
``
The
beginning
of

Well

'll

you

For

She

``

Osmond
after
some
meditation
,

Madame
Merle
,
as
she
spoke
,
had
drawn
near
the
*NL*
open
door
of
the
garden

where
she
stood
a
moment
looking
out

``
Pansy

presently
added

*NL*
*NL*

``
Why

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
,
who
had
come
to
Florence
on
Mrs.
Touchett
's
arrival
at
*NL*
the
invitation
of
this
lady
--
Mrs.
Touchett
offering
her
for
a
month
the
*NL*
hospitality
of
Palazzo
Crescentini
--
the
judicious
Madame
Merle
spoke
to
*NL*
Isabel
afresh
about
Gilbert
Osmond
and
expressed
the
hope
she
might
know
*NL*
him
;
making
,
however
,
no
such
point
of
the
matter
as
we
have
seen
her
do
*NL*
in
recommending
the
girl
herself
to
Mr.
Osmond
's
attention
.
The
reason
*NL*
of
this
was
perhaps
that
Isabel
offered
no
resistance
whatever
to
Madame
*NL*
Merle
's
proposal
.
In
Italy
,
as
in
England
,
the
lady
had
a
multitude
of
*NL*
friends
,
both
among
the
natives
of
the
country
and
its
heterogeneous
*NL*
visitors
.
She
had
mentioned
to
Isabel
most
of
the
people
the
girl
would
*NL*
find
it
well
to
``
meet
''
--
of
course
,
she
said
,
Isabel
could
know
whomever
*NL*
in
the
wide
world
she
would
--
and
had
placed
Mr.
Osmond
near
the
top
of
*NL*
the
list
.
He
was
an
old
friend
of
her
own
;
she
had
known
him
these
dozen
*NL*
years
;
he
was
one
of
the
cleverest
and
most
agreeable
men
--
well
,
in
*NL*
Europe
simply
.
He
was
altogether
above
the
respectable
average
;
quite
*NL*
another
affair
.
He
was
n't
a
professional
charmer
--
far
from
it
,
and
the
*NL*
effect
he
produced
depended
a
good
deal
on
the
state
of
his
nerves
and
*NL*
his
spirits
.
When
not
in
the
right
mood
he
could
fall
as
low
as
any
one
,
*NL*
saved
only
by
his
looking
at
such
hours
rather
like
a
demoralised
prince
*NL*
in
exile
.
But
if
he
cared
or
was
interested
or
rightly
challenged
--
just
*NL*
exactly
rightly
it
had
to
be
--
then
one
felt
his
cleverness
and
his
*NL*
distinction
.
Those
qualities
did
n't
depend
,
in
him
,
as
in
so
many
*NL*
people
,
on
his
not
committing
or
exposing
himself
.
He
had
his
*NL*
perversities
--
which
indeed
Isabel
would
find
to
be
the
case
with
all
the
*NL*
men
really
worth
knowing
--
and
did
n't
cause
his
light
to
shine
equally
*NL*
for
all
persons
.
Madame
Merle
,
however
,
thought
she
could
undertake
that
*NL*
for
Isabel
he
would
be
brilliant
.
He
was
easily
bored
,
too
easily
,
and
*NL*
dull
people
always
put
him
out
;
but
a
quick
and
cultivated
girl
like
*NL*
Isabel
would
give
him
a
stimulus
which
was
too
absent
from
his
life
.
At
*NL*
any
rate
he
was
a
person
not
to
miss
.
One
should
n't
attempt
to
live
in
*NL*
Italy
without
making
a
friend
of
Gilbert
Osmond
,
who
knew
more
about
the
*NL*
country
than
any
one
except
two
or
three
German
professors
.
And
if
*NL*
they
had
more
knowledge
than
he
it
was
he
who
had
most
perception
and
*NL*
taste
--
being
artistic
through
and
through
.
Isabel
remembered
that
her
*NL*
friend
had
spoken
of
him
during
their
plunge
,
at
Gardencourt
,
into
the
*NL*
deeps
of
talk
,
and
wondered
a
little
what
was
the
nature
of
the
tie
*NL*
binding
these
superior
spirits
.
She
felt
that
Madame
Merle
's
ties
always
*NL*
somehow
had
histories
,
and
such
an
impression
was
part
of
the
interest
*NL*
created
by
this
inordinate
woman
.
As
regards
her
relations
with
Mr.
*NL*
Osmond
,
however
,
she
hinted
at
nothing
but
a
long-established
calm
*NL*
friendship
.
Isabel
said
she
should
be
happy
to
know
a
person
who
had
*NL*
enjoyed
so
high
a
confidence
for
so
many
years
.
``
You
ought
to
see
a
*NL*
great
many
men
,
''
Madame
Merle
remarked
;
``
you
ought
to
see
as
many
as
*NL*
possible
,
so
as
to
get
used
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Used
to
them
?
''
Isabel
repeated
with
that
solemn
stare
which
sometimes
*NL*
seemed
to
proclaim
her
deficient
in
the
sense
of
comedy
.
``
Why
,
I
'm
not
*NL*
afraid
of
them
--
I
'm
as
used
to
them
as
the
cook
to
the
butcher-boys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Used
to
them
,
I
mean
,
so
as
to
despise
them
.
That
's
what
one
comes
to
*NL*
with
most
of
them
.
You
'll
pick
out
,
for
your
society
,
the
few
whom
you
*NL*
do
n't
despise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
note
of
cynicism
that
Madame
Merle
did
n't
often
allow
herself
*NL*
to
sound
;
but
Isabel
was
not
alarmed
,
for
she
had
never
supposed
that
*NL*
as
one
saw
more
of
the
world
the
sentiment
of
respect
became
the
*NL*
most
active
of
one
's
emotions
.
It
was
excited
,
none
the
less
,
by
the
*NL*
beautiful
city
of
Florence
,
which
pleased
her
not
less
than
Madame
Merle
*NL*
had
promised
;
and
if
her
unassisted
perception
had
not
been
able
to
*NL*
gauge
its
charms
she
had
clever
companions
as
priests
to
the
mystery
.
*NL*
She
was
--
in
no
want
indeed
of
esthetic
illumination
,
for
Ralph
found
it
*NL*
a
joy
that
renewed
his
own
early
passion
to
act
as
cicerone
to
his
*NL*
eager
young
kinswoman
.
Madame
Merle
remained
at
home
;
she
had
seen
the
*NL*
treasures
of
Florence
again
and
again
and
had
always
something
else
*NL*
to
do
.
But
she
talked
of
all
things
with
remarkable
vividness
of
*NL*
memory
--
she
recalled
the
right-hand
corner
of
the
large
Perugino
and
the
*NL*
position
of
the
hands
of
the
Saint
Elizabeth
in
the
picture
next
to
it
.
*NL*
She
had
her
opinions
as
to
the
character
of
many
famous
works
of
art
,
*NL*
differing
often
from
Ralph
with
great
sharpness
and
defending
her
*NL*
interpretations
with
as
much
ingenuity
as
good-humour
.
Isabel
listened
*NL*
to
the
discussions
taking
place
between
the
two
with
a
sense
that
*NL*
she
might
derive
much
benefit
from
them
and
that
they
were
among
the
*NL*
advantages
she
could
n't
have
enjoyed
for
instance
in
Albany
.
In
the
*NL*
clear
May
mornings
before
the
formal
breakfast
--
this
repast
at
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
's
was
served
at
twelve
o'clock
--
she
wandered
with
her
cousin
*NL*
through
the
narrow
and
sombre
Florentine
streets
,
resting
a
while
in
*NL*
the
thicker
dusk
of
some
historic
church
or
the
vaulted
chambers
of
some
*NL*
dispeopled
convent
.
She
went
to
the
galleries
and
palaces
;
she
looked
at
*NL*
the
pictures
and
statues
that
had
hitherto
been
great
names
to
her
,
*NL*
and
exchanged
for
a
knowledge
which
was
sometimes
a
limitation
a
*NL*
presentiment
which
proved
usually
to
have
been
a
blank
.
She
performed
*NL*
all
those
acts
of
mental
prostration
in
which
,
on
a
first
visit
to
*NL*
Italy
,
youth
and
enthusiasm
so
freely
indulge
;
she
felt
her
heart
beat
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
immortal
genius
and
knew
the
sweetness
of
rising
*NL*
tears
in
eyes
to
which
faded
fresco
and
darkened
marble
grew
dim
.
But
*NL*
the
return
,
every
day
,
was
even
pleasanter
than
the
going
forth
;
the
*NL*
return
into
the
wide
,
monumental
court
of
the
great
house
in
which
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
,
many
years
before
,
had
established
herself
,
and
into
the
*NL*
high
,
cool
rooms
where
the
carven
rafters
and
pompous
frescoes
of
the
*NL*
sixteenth
century
looked
down
on
the
familiar
commodities
of
the
age
of
*NL*
advertisement
.
Mrs.
Touchett
inhabited
an
historic
building
in
a
narrow
*NL*
street
whose
very
name
recalled
the
strife
of
medieval
factions
;
and
*NL*
found
compensation
for
the
darkness
of
her
frontage
in
the
modicity
of
*NL*
her
rent
and
the
brightness
of
a
garden
where
nature
itself
looked
as
*NL*
archaic
as
the
rugged
architecture
of
the
palace
and
which
cleared
*NL*
and
scented
the
rooms
in
regular
use
.
To
live
in
such
a
place
was
,
for
*NL*
Isabel
,
to
hold
to
her
ear
all
day
a
shell
of
the
sea
of
the
past
.
This
*NL*
vague
eternal
rumour
kept
her
imagination
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gilbert
Osmond
came
to
see
Madame
Merle
,
who
presented
him
to
the
young
*NL*
lady
lurking
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
Isabel
took
on
this
occasion
*NL*
little
part
in
the
talk
;
she
scarcely
even
smiled
when
the
others
turned
*NL*
to
her
invitingly
;
she
sat
there
as
if
she
had
been
at
the
play
and
had
*NL*
paid
even
a
large
sum
for
her
place
.
Mrs.
Touchett
was
not
present
,
and
*NL*
these
two
had
it
,
for
the
effect
of
brilliancy
,
all
their
own
way
.
They
*NL*
talked
of
the
Florentine
,
the
Roman
,
the
cosmopolite
world
,
and
might
*NL*
have
been
distinguished
performers
figuring
for
a
charity
.
It
all
had
*NL*
the
rich
readiness
that
would
have
come
from
rehearsal
.
Madame
Merle
*NL*
appealed
to
her
as
if
she
had
been
on
the
stage
,
but
she
could
ignore
*NL*
any
learnt
cue
without
spoiling
the
scene
--
though
of
course
she
thus
put
*NL*
dreadfully
in
the
wrong
the
friend
who
had
told
Mr.
Osmond
she
could
be
*NL*
depended
on
.
This
was
no
matter
for
once
;
even
if
more
had
been
involved
*NL*
she
could
have
made
no
attempt
to
shine
.
There
was
something
in
*NL*
the
visitor
that
checked
her
and
held
her
in
suspense
--
made
it
more
*NL*
important
she
should
get
an
impression
of
him
than
that
she
should
*NL*
produce
one
herself
.
Besides
,
she
had
little
skill
in
producing
an
*NL*
impression
which
she
knew
to
be
expected
:
nothing
could
be
happier
,
in
*NL*
general
,
than
to
seem
dazzling
,
but
she
had
a
perverse
unwillingness
to
*NL*
glitter
by
arrangement
.
Mr.
Osmond
,
to
do
him
justice
,
had
a
well-bred
*NL*
air
of
expecting
nothing
,
a
quiet
ease
that
covered
everything
,
even
the
*NL*
first
show
of
his
own
wit
.
This
was
the
more
grateful
as
his
face
,
his
*NL*
head
,
was
sensitive
;
he
was
not
handsome
,
but
he
was
fine
,
as
fine
as
*NL*
one
of
the
drawings
in
the
long
gallery
above
the
bridge
of
the
*NL*
Uffizi
.
And
his
very
voice
was
fine
--
the
more
strangely
that
,
with
its
*NL*
clearness
,
it
yet
somehow
was
n't
sweet
.
This
had
had
really
to
do
with
*NL*
making
her
abstain
from
interference
.
His
utterance
was
the
vibration
*NL*
of
glass
,
and
if
she
had
put
out
her
finger
she
might
have
changed
the
*NL*
pitch
and
spoiled
the
concert
.
Yet
before
he
went
she
had
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Merle
,
''
he
said
,
``
consents
to
come
up
to
my
hill-top
some
day
*NL*
next
week
and
drink
tea
in
my
garden
.
It
would
give
me
much
pleasure
if
*NL*
you
would
come
with
her
.
It
's
thought
rather
pretty
--
there
's
what
they
*NL*
call
a
general
view
.
My
daughter
too
would
be
so
glad
--
or
rather
,
for
*NL*
she
's
too
young
to
have
strong
emotions
,
I
should
be
so
glad
--
so
very
*NL*
glad
.
''
And
Mr.
Osmond
paused
with
a
slight
air
of
embarrassment
,
leaving
*NL*
his
sentence
unfinished
.
``
I
should
be
so
happy
if
you
could
know
my
*NL*
daughter
,
''
he
went
on
a
moment
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
replied
that
she
should
be
delighted
to
see
Miss
Osmond
and
that
*NL*
if
Madame
Merle
would
show
her
the
way
to
the
hill-top
she
should
be
*NL*
very
grateful
.
Upon
this
assurance
the
visitor
took
his
leave
;
after
*NL*
which
Isabel
fully
expected
her
friend
would
scold
her
for
having
been
*NL*
so
stupid
.
But
to
her
surprise
that
lady
,
who
indeed
never
fell
into
the
*NL*
mere
matter-of-course
,
said
to
her
in
a
few
moments
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
charming
,
my
dear
;
you
were
just
as
one
would
have
wished
you
.
*NL*
You
're
never
disappointing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
rebuke
might
possibly
have
been
irritating
,
though
it
is
much
more
*NL*
probable
that
Isabel
would
have
taken
it
in
good
part
;
but
,
strange
*NL*
to
say
,
the
words
that
Madame
Merle
actually
used
caused
her
the
first
*NL*
feeling
of
displeasure
she
had
known
this
ally
to
excite
.
``
That
's
more
*NL*
than
I
intended
,
''
she
answered
coldly
.
``
I
'm
under
no
obligation
that
I
*NL*
know
of
to
charm
Mr.
Osmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
perceptibly
flushed
,
but
we
know
it
was
not
her
habit
to
*NL*
retract
.
``
My
dear
child
,
I
did
n't
speak
for
him
,
poor
man
;
I
spoke
for
*NL*
yourself
.
It
's
not
of
course
a
question
as
to
his
liking
you
;
it
matters
*NL*
little
whether
he
likes
you
or
not
!
But
I
thought
you
liked
HIM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
,
''
said
Isabel
honestly
.
``
But
I
do
n't
see
what
that
matters
*NL*
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
that
concerns
you
matters
to
me
,
''
Madame
Merle
returned
*NL*
with
her
weary
nobleness
;
``
especially
when
at
the
same
time
another
old
*NL*
friend
's
concerned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
Isabel
's
obligations
may
have
been
to
Mr.
Osmond
,
it
must
be
*NL*
admitted
that
she
found
them
sufficient
to
lead
her
to
put
to
Ralph
*NL*
sundry
questions
about
him
.
She
thought
Ralph
's
judgements
distorted
by
*NL*
his
trials
,
but
she
flattered
herself
she
had
learned
to
make
allowance
*NL*
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
know
him
?
''
said
her
cousin
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
`
know
'
him
;
not
well
,
*NL*
but
on
the
whole
enough
.
I
've
never
cultivated
his
society
,
and
he
*NL*
apparently
has
never
found
mine
indispensable
to
his
happiness
.
Who
is
*NL*
he
,
what
is
he
?
He
's
a
vague
,
unexplained
American
who
has
been
living
*NL*
these
thirty
years
,
or
less
,
in
Italy
.
Why
do
I
call
him
unexplained
?
*NL*
Only
as
a
cover
for
my
ignorance
;
I
do
n't
know
his
antecedents
,
his
*NL*
family
,
his
origin
.
For
all
I
do
know
he
may
be
a
prince
in
disguise
;
he
*NL*
rather
looks
like
one
,
by
the
way
--
like
a
prince
who
has
abdicated
in
a
*NL*
fit
of
fastidiousness
and
has
been
in
a
state
of
disgust
ever
since
.
He
*NL*
used
to
live
in
Rome
;
but
of
late
years
he
has
taken
up
his
abode
here
;
*NL*
I
remember
hearing
him
say
that
Rome
has
grown
vulgar
.
He
has
a
great
*NL*
dread
of
vulgarity
;
that
's
his
special
line
;
he
has
n't
any
other
that
I
*NL*
know
of
.
He
lives
on
his
income
,
which
I
suspect
of
not
being
vulgarly
*NL*
large
.
He
's
a
poor
but
honest
gentleman
that
's
what
he
calls
himself
.
*NL*
He
married
young
and
lost
his
wife
,
and
I
believe
he
has
a
daughter
.
He
*NL*
also
has
a
sister
,
who
's
married
to
some
small
Count
or
other
,
of
these
*NL*
parts
;
I
remember
meeting
her
of
old
.
She
's
nicer
than
he
,
I
should
*NL*
think
,
but
rather
impossible
.
I
remember
there
used
to
be
some
stories
*NL*
about
her
.
I
do
n't
think
I
recommend
you
to
know
her
.
But
why
do
n't
you
*NL*
ask
Madame
Merle
about
these
people
?
She
knows
them
all
much
better
than
*NL*
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
you
because
I
want
your
opinion
as
well
as
hers
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fig
for
my
opinion
!
If
you
fall
in
love
with
Mr.
Osmond
what
will
you
*NL*
care
for
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
,
probably
.
But
meanwhile
it
has
a
certain
importance
.
The
more
*NL*
information
one
has
about
one
's
dangers
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
agree
to
that
--
it
may
make
them
dangers
.
We
know
too
much
about
*NL*
people
in
these
days
;
we
hear
too
much
.
Our
ears
,
our
minds
,
our
mouths
,
*NL*
are
stuffed
with
personalities
.
Do
n't
mind
anything
any
one
tells
you
*NL*
about
any
one
else
.
Judge
everyone
and
everything
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
try
to
do
,
''
said
Isabel
``
but
when
you
do
that
people
call
*NL*
you
conceited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
to
mind
them
--
that
's
precisely
my
argument
;
not
to
mind
what
*NL*
they
say
about
yourself
any
more
than
what
they
say
about
your
friend
or
*NL*
your
enemy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
considered
.
``
I
think
you
're
right
;
but
there
are
some
things
I
*NL*
ca
n't
help
minding
:
for
instance
when
my
friend
's
attacked
or
when
I
*NL*
myself
am
praised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
're
always
at
liberty
to
judge
the
critic
.
Judge
people
as
*NL*
critics
,
however
,
''
Ralph
added
,
``
and
you
'll
condemn
them
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
see
Mr.
Osmond
for
myself
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
I
've
promised
to
pay
*NL*
him
a
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
go

see
his

I
do
n't
know
*NL*
exactly
what

Madame
Merle
's

take
me

she
tells
me

great
many

call
on
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
with
Madame
Merle
you
may
go
anywhere

''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
``
She
knows
none
but
the
best
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
said
no
more
about
Mr.
Osmond
,
but
she
presently
remarked
to
her
*NL*
cousin
that
she
was
not
satisfied
with
his
tone
about
Madame
Merle
.
``
It
*NL*
seems
to
me
you
insinuate
things
about
her
.
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
*NL*
but
if
you
've
any
grounds
for
disliking
her
I
think
you
should
either
*NL*
mention
them
frankly
or
else
say
nothing
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
,
however
,
resented
this
charge
with
more
apparent
earnestness
than
*NL*
he
commonly
used
.
``
I
speak
of
Madame
Merle
exactly
as
I
speak
to
her
:
*NL*
with
an
even
exaggerated
respect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exaggerated
,
precisely
.
That
's
what
I
complain
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
so
because
Madame
Merle
's
merits
are
exaggerated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
whom

pray
?
By
me
?
If
so
I
do
her
a
poor
service

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
by
herself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
protest
!

Isabel
earnestly
cried
.
``
If
ever
there
was
a
woman
who
*NL*
made
small
claims
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
put
your
finger
on
it

''
Ralph
interrupted
.
``
Her
modesty

exaggerated

make
large
ones

*NL*
*NL*
``

large

*NL*
*NL*
``
Her

immense

said
Ralph
.
``
She
's
indescribably
blameless

pathless

virtue

woman
I

that
one
little
fault

''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
turned
away
with
impatience
.
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
;
you
're
too
*NL*
paradoxical
for
my
plain
mind

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
explain
.
When
I
say
she
exaggerates
I
do
n't
mean
it
in
the
*NL*
vulgar
sense
--
that
she
boasts
,
overstates
,
gives
too
fine
an
account
of
*NL*
herself
.
I
mean
literally
that
she
pushes
the
search
for
perfection
too
*NL*
far
--
that
her
merits
are
in
themselves
overstrained
.
She
's
too
good
,
too
*NL*
kind
,
too
clever
,
too
learned
,
too
accomplished
,
too
everything
.
She
's
*NL*
too
complete
,
in
a
word
.
I
confess
to
you
that
she
acts
on
my
nerves
and
*NL*
that
I
feel
about
her
a
good
deal
as
that
intensely
human
Athenian
felt
*NL*
about
Aristides
the
Just
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
looked
hard
at
her
cousin
;
but
the
mocking
spirit
,
if
it
lurked
*NL*
in
his
words
,
failed
on
this
occasion
to
peep
from
his
face
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
wish
Madame
Merle
to
be
banished
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
.
She
's
much
too
good
company
.
I
delight
in
Madame
Merle
,
''
*NL*
said
Ralph
Touchett
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
odious
,
sir
!
''
Isabel
exclaimed
.
And
then
she
asked
him
if
*NL*
he
knew
anything
that
was
not
to
the
honour
of
her
brilliant
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
whatever
.
Do
n't
you
see
that
's
just
what
I
mean
?
On
the
*NL*
character
of
every
one
else
you
may
find
some
little
black
speck
;
if
*NL*
I
were
to
take
half
an
hour
to
it
,
some
day
,
I
've
no
doubt
I
should
be
*NL*
able
to
find
one
on
yours
.
For
my
own
,
of
course
,
I
'm
spotted
like
a
*NL*
leopard
.
But
on
Madame
Merle
's
nothing
,
nothing
,
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
think
!
''
said
Isabel
with
a
toss
of
her
head
.
``
That
*NL*
is
why
I
like
her
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
capital
person
for
you
to
know
.
Since
you
wish
to
see
the
world
*NL*
you
could
n't
have
a
better
guide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
mean
by
that
that
she
's
worldly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worldly
?
No
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
she
's
the
great
round
world
itself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
certainly
not
,
as
Isabel
for
the
moment
took
it
into
her
head
to
*NL*
believe
,
been
a
refinement
of
malice
in
him
to
say
that
he
delighted
in
*NL*
Madame
Merle
.
Ralph
Touchett
took
his
refreshment
wherever
he
could
find
*NL*
it
,
and
he
would
not
have
forgiven
himself
if
he
had
been
left
wholly
*NL*
unbeguiled
by
such
a
mistress
of
the
social
art
.
There
are
deep-lying
*NL*
sympathies
and
antipathies
,
and
it
may
have
been
that
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
administered
justice
she
enjoyed
at
his
hands
,
her
absence
from
his
*NL*
mother
's
house
would
not
have
made
life
barren
to
him
.
But
Ralph
*NL*
Touchett
had
learned
more
or
less
inscrutably
to
attend
,
and
there
could
*NL*
have
been
nothing
so
``
sustained
''
to
attend
to
as
the
general
performance
*NL*
of
Madame
Merle
.
He
tasted
her
in
sips
,
he
let
her
stand
,
with
an
*NL*
opportuneness
she
herself
could
not
have
surpassed
.
There
were
moments
*NL*
when
he
felt
almost
sorry
for
her
;
and
these
,
oddly
enough
,
were
the
*NL*
moments
when
his
kindness
was
least
demonstrative
.
He
was
sure
she
had
*NL*
been
yearningly
ambitious
and
that
what
she
had
visibly
accomplished
was
*NL*
far
below
her
secret
measure
.
She
had
got
herself
into
perfect
training
,
*NL*
but
had
won
none
of
the
prizes
.
She
was
always
plain
Madame
Merle
,
*NL*
the
widow
of
a
Swiss
negociant
,
with
a
small
income
and
a
large
*NL*
acquaintance
,
who
stayed
with
people
a
great
deal
and
was
almost
as
*NL*
universally
``
liked
''
as
some
new
volume
of
smooth
twaddle
.
The
contrast
*NL*
between
this
position
and
any
one
of
some
half-dozen
others
that
he
*NL*
supposed
to
have
at
various
moments
engaged
her
hope
had
an
element
of
*NL*
the
tragical
.
His
mother
thought
he
got
on
beautifully
with
their
genial
*NL*
guest
;
to
Mrs.
Touchett
's
sense
two
persons
who
dealt
so
largely
in
*NL*
too-ingenious
theories
of
conduct
--
that
is
of
their
own
--
would
have
much
*NL*
in
common
.
He
had
given
due
consideration
to
Isabel
's
intimacy
with
her
*NL*
eminent
friend
,
having
long
since
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
not
,
*NL*
without
opposition
,
keep
his
cousin
to
himself
;
and
he
made
the
best
of
*NL*
it
,
as
he
had
done
of
worse
things
.
He
believed
it
would
take
care
of
*NL*
itself
;
it
would
n't
last
forever
.
Neither
of
these
two
superior
persons
*NL*
knew
the
other
as
well
as
she
supposed
,
and
when
each
had
made
an
*NL*
important
discovery
or
two
there
would
be
,
if
not
a
rupture
,
at
least
*NL*
a
relaxation
.
Meanwhile
he
was
quite
willing
to
admit
that
the
*NL*
conversation
of
the
elder
lady
was
an
advantage
to
the
younger
,
who
had
*NL*
a
great
deal
to
learn
and
would
doubtless
learn
it
better
from
Madame
*NL*
Merle
than
from
some
other
instructors
of
the
young
.
It
was
not
probable
*NL*
that
Isabel
would
be
injured
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
certainly
have
been
hard
to
see
what
injury
could
arise
to
*NL*
her
from
the
visit
she
presently
paid
to
Mr.
Osmond
's
hill-top
.
Nothing
*NL*
could
have
been
more
charming
than
this
occasion
--
a
soft
afternoon
in
*NL*
the
full
maturity
of
the
Tuscan
spring
.
The
companions
drove
out
of
the
*NL*
Roman
Gate
,
beneath
the
enormous
blank
superstructure
which
crowns
the
*NL*
fine
clear
arch
of
that
portal
and
makes
it
nakedly
impressive
,
and
*NL*
wound
between
high-walled
lanes
into
which
the
wealth
of
blossoming
*NL*
orchards
over-drooped
and
flung
a
fragrance
,
until
they
reached
the
*NL*
small
superurban
piazza
,
of
crooked
shape
,
where
the
long
brown
wall
of
*NL*
the
villa
occupied
in
part
by
Mr.
Osmond
formed
a
principal
,
or
at
least
*NL*
a
very
imposing
,
object
.
Isabel
went
with
her
friend
through
a
wide
,
*NL*
high
court
,
where
a
clear
shadow
rested
below
and
a
pair
of
light-arched
*NL*
galleries
,
facing
each
other
above
,
caught
the
upper
sunshine
upon
their
*NL*
slim
columns
and
the
flowering
plants
in
which
they
were
dressed
.
There
*NL*
was
something
grave
and
strong
in
the
place
;
it
looked
somehow
as
*NL*
if
,
once
you
were
in
,
you
would
need
an
act
of
energy
to
get
out
.
For
*NL*
Isabel
,
however
,
there
was
of
course
as
yet
no
thought
of
getting
out
,
*NL*
but
only
of
advancing
.
Mr.
Osmond
met
her
in
the
cold
ante-chamber
--
it
*NL*
was
cold
even
in
the
month
of
May
--
and
ushered
her
,
with
her
*NL*
conductress
,
into
the
apartment
to
which
we
have
already
been
*NL*
introduced
.
Madame
Merle
was
in
front
,
and
while
Isabel
lingered
a
*NL*
little
,
talking
with
him
,
she
went
forward
familiarly
and
greeted
two
*NL*
persons
who
were
seated
in
the
saloon
.
One
of
these
was
little
Pansy
,
on
*NL*
whom
she
bestowed
a
kiss
;
the
other
was
a
lady
whom
Mr.
Osmond
indicated
*NL*
to
Isabel
as
his
sister
,
the
Countess
Gemini
.
``
And
that
's
my
little
*NL*
girl
,
''
he
said
,
``
who
has
just
come
out
of
her
convent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
had
on
a
scant
white
dress
,
and
her
fair
hair
was
neatly
arranged
*NL*
in
a
net
;
she
wore
her
small
shoes
tied
sandal-fashion
about
her
ankles
.
*NL*
She
made
Isabel
a
little
conventual
curtsey
and
then
came
to
be
kissed
.
*NL*
The
Countess
Gemini
simply
nodded
without
getting
up
:
Isabel
could
see
*NL*
she
was
a
woman
of
high
fashion
.
She
was
thin
and
dark
and
not
at
*NL*
all
pretty
,
having
features
that
suggested
some
tropical
bird
--
a
long
*NL*
beak-like
nose
,
small
,
quickly-moving
eyes
and
a
mouth
and
chin
*NL*
that
receded
extremely
.
Her
expression
,
however
,
thanks
to
various
*NL*
intensities
of
emphasis
and
wonder
,
of
horror
and
joy
,
was
not
inhuman
,
*NL*
and
,
as
regards
her
appearance
,
it
was
plain
she
understood
herself
*NL*
and
made
the
most
of
her
points
.
Her
attire
,
voluminous
and
delicate
,
*NL*
bristling
with
elegance
,
had
the
look
of
shimmering
plumage
,
and
her
*NL*
attitudes
were
as
light
and
sudden
as
those
of
a
creature
who
perched
*NL*
upon
twigs
.
She
had
a
great
deal
of
manner
;
Isabel
,
who
had
never
*NL*
known
any
one
with
so
much
manner
,
immediately
classed
her
as
the
most
*NL*
affected
of
women
.
She
remembered
that
Ralph
had
not
recommended
her
as
*NL*
an
acquaintance
;
but
she
was
ready
to
acknowledge
that
to
a
casual
view
*NL*
the
Countess
Gemini
revealed
no
depths
.
Her
demonstrations
suggested
the
*NL*
violent
waving
of
some
flag
of
general
truce
--
white
silk
with
fluttering
*NL*
streamers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
believe
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
when
I
tell
you
it
's
only
because
*NL*
I
knew
you
were
to
be
here
that
I
came
myself
.
I
do
n't
come
and
see
my
*NL*
brother
--
I
make
him
come
and
see
me
.
This
hill
of
his
is
impossible
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
what
possesses
him
.
Really
,
Osmond
,
you
'll
be
the
ruin
of
my
*NL*
horses
some
day
,
and
if
it
hurts
them
you
'll
have
to
give
me
another
*NL*
pair
.
I
heard
them
wheezing
to-day
;
I
assure
you
I
did
.
It
's
very
*NL*
disagreeable
to
hear
one
's
horses
wheezing
when
one
's
sitting
in
the
*NL*
carriage
;
it
sounds
too
as
if
they
were
n't
what
they
should
be
.
But
*NL*
I
've
always
had
good
horses
;
whatever
else
I
may
have
lacked
I
've
always
*NL*
managed
that
.
My
husband
does
n't
know
much
,
but
I
think
he
knows
a
*NL*
horse
.
In
general
Italians
do
n't
,
but
my
husband
goes
in
,
according
to
*NL*
his
poor
light
,
for
everything
English
.
My
horses
are
English
--
so
it
's
*NL*
all
the
greater
pity
they
should
be
ruined
.
I
must
tell
you
,
''
she
went
*NL*
on
,
directly
addressing
Isabel
,
``
that
Osmond
does
n't
often
invite
me
;
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
he
likes
to
have
me
.
It
was
quite
my
own
idea
,
coming
*NL*
to-day
.
I
like
to
see
new
people
,
and
I
'm
sure
you
're
very
new
.
But
*NL*
do
n't
sit
there
;
that
chair
's
not
what
it
looks
.
There
are
some
very
*NL*
good
seats
here
,
but
there
are
also
some
horrors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
remarks
were
delivered
with
a
series
of
little
jerks
and
pecks
,
of
*NL*
roulades
of
shrillness
,
and
in
an
accent
that
was
as
some
fond
recall
of
*NL*
good
English
,
or
rather
of
good
American
,
in
adversity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
to
have
you
,
my
dear
?
''
said
her
brother
.
``
I
'm
sure
you
're
*NL*
invaluable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
any
horrors
anywhere
,
''
Isabel
returned
,
looking
about
her
.
*NL*
``
Everything
seems
to
me
beautiful
and
precious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
a
few
good
things
,
''
Mr.
Osmond
allowed
;
``
indeed
I
've
nothing
very
*NL*
bad
.
But
I
've
not
what
I
should
have
liked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
there
a
little
awkwardly
,
smiling
and
glancing
about
;
his
*NL*
manner
was
an
odd
mixture
of
the
detached
and
the
involved
.
He
seemed
to
*NL*
hint
that
nothing
but
the
right
``
values
''
was
of
any
consequence
.
Isabel
*NL*
made
a
rapid
induction
:
perfect
simplicity
was
not
the
badge
of
his
*NL*
family
.
Even
the
little
girl
from
the
convent
,
who
,
in
her
prim
white
*NL*
dress
,
with
her
small
submissive
face
and
her
hands
locked
before
her
,
*NL*
stood
there
as
if
she
were
about
to
partake
of
her
first
communion
,
*NL*
even
Mr.
Osmond
's
diminutive
daughter
had
a
kind
of
finish
that
was
not
*NL*
entirely
artless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
have
liked
a
few
things
from
the
Uffizi
and
the
Pitti
--
that
's
what
*NL*
you
'd
have
liked
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Osmond
,
with
his
old
curtains
and
crucifixes
!
''
the
Countess
Gemini
*NL*
exclaimed
:
she
appeared
to
call
her
brother
only
by
his
family-name
.
Her
*NL*
ejaculation
had
no
particular
object
;
she
smiled
at
Isabel
as
she
made
*NL*
it
and
looked
at
her
from
head
to
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
had
not
heard
her
;
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
what
he
could
*NL*
say
to
Isabel
.
``
Wo
n't
you
have
some
tea
?
--
you
must
be
very
tired
,
''
he
at
*NL*
last
bethought
himself
of
remarking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
indeed
,
I
'm
not
tired
;
what
have
I
done
to
tire
me
?
''
Isabel
felt
a
*NL*
certain
need
of
being
very
direct
,
of
pretending
to
nothing
;
there
was
*NL*
something
in
the
air
,
in
her
general
impression
of
things
--
she
could
*NL*
hardly
have
said
what
it
was
--
that
deprived
her
of
all
disposition
to
*NL*
put
herself
forward
.
The
place
,
the
occasion
,
the
combination
of
people
,
*NL*
signified
more
than
lay
on
the
surface
;
she
would
try
to
understand
--
she
*NL*
would
not
simply
utter
graceful
platitudes
.
Poor
Isabel
was
doubtless
*NL*
not
aware
that
many
women
would
have
uttered
graceful
platitudes
to
*NL*
cover
the
working
of
their
observation
.
It
must
be
confessed
that
her
*NL*
pride
was
a
trifle
alarmed
.
A
man
she
had
heard
spoken
of
in
terms
*NL*
that
excited
interest
and
who
was
evidently
capable
of
distinguishing
*NL*
himself
,
had
invited
her
,
a
young
lady
not
lavish
of
her
favours
,
*NL*
to
come
to
his
house
.
Now
that
she
had
done
so
the
burden
of
the
*NL*
entertainment
rested
naturally
on
his
wit
.
Isabel
was
not
rendered
*NL*
less
observant
,
and
for
the
moment
,
we
judge
,
she
was
not
rendered
*NL*
more
indulgent
,
by
perceiving
that
Mr.
Osmond
carried
his
burden
less
*NL*
complacently
than
might
have
been
expected
.
``
What
a
fool
I
was
to
*NL*
have
let
myself
so
needlessly
in
--
!
''
she
could
fancy
his
exclaiming
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
tired
when
you
go
home
,
if
he
shows
you
all
his
bibelots
and
*NL*
gives
you
a
lecture
on
each
,
''
said
the
Countess
Gemini
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
afraid
of
that
;
but
if
I
'm
tired
I
shall
at
least
have
learned
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
little
,
I
suspect
.
But
my
sister
's
dreadfully
afraid
of
learning
*NL*
anything
,
''
said
Mr.
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
confess
to
that
;
I
do
n't
want
to
know
anything
more
--
I
know
too
*NL*
much
already
.
The
more
you
know
the
more
unhappy
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
not
undervalue
knowledge
before
Pansy
,
who
has
not
finished
*NL*
her
education
,
''
Madame
Merle
interposed
with
a
smile
.
``
Pansy
will
*NL*
never
know
any
harm
,
''
said
the
child
's
father
.
``
Pansy
's
a
little
*NL*
convent-flower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
convents
,
the
convents
!
''
cried
the
Countess
with
a
flutter
of
*NL*
her
ruffles
.
``
Speak
to
me
of
the
convents
!
You
may
learn
anything
there
;
*NL*
I
'm
a
convent-flower
myself
.
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
good
,
but
the
nuns
*NL*
do
.
Do
n't
you
see
what
I
mean
?
''
she
went
on
,
appealing
to
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
not
sure
she
saw
,
and
she
answered
that
she
was
very
bad
*NL*
at
following
arguments
.
The
Countess
then
declared
that
she
herself
*NL*
detested
arguments
,
but
that
this
was
her
brother
's
taste
--
he
would
*NL*
always
discuss
.
``
For
me
,
''
she
said
,
``
one
should
like
a
thing
or
one
*NL*
should
n't
;
one
ca
n't
like
everything
,
of
course
.
But
one
should
n't
*NL*
attempt
to
reason
it
out
--
you
never
know
where
it
may
lead
you
.
There
*NL*
are
some
very
good
feelings
that
may
have
bad
reasons
,
do
n't
you
know
?
*NL*
And
then
there
are
very
bad
feelings
,
sometimes
,
that
have
good
reasons
.
*NL*
Do
n't
you
see
what
I
mean
?
I
do
n't
care
anything
about
reasons
,
but
I
*NL*
know
what
I
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
the
great
thing
,
''
said
Isabel
,
smiling
and
suspecting
that
*NL*
her
acquaintance
with
this
lightly
flitting
personage
would
not
lead
to
*NL*
intellectual
repose
.
If
the
Countess
objected
to
argument
Isabel
at
this
*NL*
moment
had
as
little
taste
for
it
,
and
she
put
out
her
hand
to
Pansy
*NL*
with
a
pleasant
sense
that
such
a
gesture
committed
her
to
nothing
that
*NL*
would
admit
of
a
divergence
of
views
.
Gilbert
Osmond
apparently
took
a
*NL*
rather
hopeless
view
of
his
sister
's
tone
;
he
turned
the
conversation
to
*NL*
another
topic
.
He
presently
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
his
daughter
,
*NL*
who
had
shyly
brushed
Isabel
's
fingers
with
her
own
;
but
he
ended
by
*NL*
drawing
her
out
of
her
chair
and
making
her
stand
between
his
knees
,
*NL*
leaning
against
him
while
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
slimness
.
The
*NL*
child
fixed
her
eyes
on
Isabel
with
a
still
,
disinterested
gaze
which
*NL*
seemed
void
of
an
intention
,
yet
conscious
of
an
attraction
.
Mr.
Osmond
*NL*
talked
of
many
things
;
Madame
Merle
had
said
he
could
be
agreeable
*NL*
when
he
chose
,
and
to-day
,
after
a
little
,
he
appeared
not
only
to
have
*NL*
chosen
but
to
have
determined
.
Madame
Merle
and
the
Countess
Gemini
sat
*NL*
a
little
apart
,
conversing
in
the
effortless
manner
of
persons
who
knew
*NL*
each
other
well
enough
to
take
their
ease
;
but
every
now
and
then
Isabel
*NL*
heard
the
Countess
,
at
something
said
by
her
companion
,
plunge
into
the
*NL*
latter
's
lucidity
as
a
poodle
splashes
after
a
thrown
stick
.
It
was
as
*NL*
if
Madame
Merle
were
seeing
how
far
she
would
go
.
Mr.
Osmond
talked
of
*NL*
Florence
,
of
Italy
,
of
the
pleasure
of
living
in
that
country
and
of
the
*NL*
abatements
to
the
pleasure
.
There
were
both
satisfactions
and
drawbacks
;
*NL*
the
drawbacks
were
numerous
;
strangers
were
too
apt
to
see
such
a
world
*NL*
as
all
romantic
.
It
met
the
case
soothingly
for
the
human
,
for
the
*NL*
social
failure
--
by
which
he
meant
the
people
who
could
n't
``
realise
,
''
as
*NL*
they
said
,
on
their
sensibility
:
they
could
keep
it
about
them
there
,
*NL*
in
their
poverty
,
without
ridicule
,
as
you
might
keep
an
heirloom
or
an
*NL*
inconvenient
entailed
place
that
brought
you
in
nothing
.
Thus
there
were
*NL*
advantages
in
living
in
the
country
which
contained
the
greatest
sum
of
*NL*
beauty
.
Certain
impressions
you
could
get
only
there
.
Others
,
favourable
*NL*
to
life
,
you
never
got
,
and
you
got
some
that
were
very
bad
.
But
from
*NL*
time
to
time
you
got
one
of
a
quality
that
made
up
for
everything
.
*NL*
Italy
,
all
the
same
,
had
spoiled
a
great
many
people
;
he
was
even
*NL*
fatuous
enough
to
believe
at
times
that
he
himself
might
have
been
a
*NL*
better
man
if
he
had
spent
less
of
his
life
there
.
It
made
one
idle
and
*NL*
dilettantish
and
second-rate
;
it
had
no
discipline
for
the
character
,
*NL*
did
n't
cultivate
in
you
,
otherwise
expressed
,
the
successful
social
*NL*
and
other
``
cheek
''
that
flourished
in
Paris
and
London
.
``
We
're
sweetly
*NL*
provincial
,
''
said
Mr.
Osmond
,
``
and
I
'm
perfectly
aware
that
I
myself
am
*NL*
as
rusty
as
a
key
that
has
no
lock
to
fit
it
.
It
polishes
me
up
a
little
*NL*
to
talk
with
you
--
not
that
I
venture
to
pretend
I
can
turn
that
very
*NL*
complicated
lock
I
suspect
your
intellect
of
being
!
But
you
'll
be
going
*NL*
away
before
I
've
seen
you
three
times
,
and
I
shall
perhaps
never
see
you
*NL*
after
that
.
That
's
what
it
is
to
live
in
a
country
that
people
come
to
.
*NL*
When
they
're
disagreeable
here
it
's
bad
enough
;
when
they
're
agreeable
*NL*
it
's
still
worse
.
As
soon
as
you
like
them
they
're
off
again
!
I
've
been
*NL*
deceived
too
often
;
I
've
ceased
to
form
attachments
,
to
permit
myself
*NL*
to
feel
attractions
.
You
mean
to
stay
--
to
settle
?
That
would
be
really
*NL*
comfortable
.
Ah
yes
,
your
aunt
's
a
sort
of
guarantee
;
I
believe
she
may
*NL*
be
depended
on
.
Oh
,
she
's
an
old
Florentine
;
I
mean
literally
an
old
*NL*
one
;
not
a
modern
outsider
.
She
's
a
contemporary
of
the
Medici
;
she
must
*NL*
have
been
present
at
the
burning
of
Savonarola
,
and
I
'm
not
sure
she
*NL*
did
n't
throw
a
handful
of
chips
into
the
flame
.
Her
face
is
very
much
*NL*
like
some
faces
in
the
early
pictures
;
little
,
dry
,
definite
faces
that
*NL*
must
have
had
a
good
deal
of
expression
,
but
almost
always
the
same
one
.
*NL*
Indeed
I
can
show
you
her
portrait
in
a
fresco
of
Ghirlandaio
's
.
I
hope
*NL*
you
do
n't
object
to
my
speaking
that
way
of
your
aunt
,
eh
?
I
've
an
idea
*NL*
you
do
n't
.
Perhaps
you
think
that
's
even
worse
.
I
assure
you
there
's
*NL*
no
want
of
respect
in
it
,
to
either
of
you
.
You
know
I
'm
a
particular
*NL*
admirer
of
Mrs.
Touchett
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Isabel
's
host
exerted
himself
to
entertain
her
in
this
somewhat
*NL*
confidential
fashion
she
looked
occasionally
at
Madame
Merle
,
who
met
*NL*
her
eyes
with
an
inattentive
smile
in
which
,
on
this
occasion
,
there
*NL*
was
no
infelicitous
intimation
that
our
heroine
appeared
to
advantage
.
*NL*
Madame
Merle
eventually
proposed
to
the
Countess
Gemini
that
they
*NL*
should
go
into
the
garden
,
and
the
Countess
,
rising
and
shaking
out
*NL*
her
feathers
,
began
to
rustle
toward
the
door
.
``
Poor
Miss
Archer
!
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
surveying
the
other
group
with
expressive
compassion
.
``
She
*NL*
has
been
brought
quite
into
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Archer
can
certainly
have
nothing
but
sympathy
for
a
family
to
*NL*
which
you
belong
,
''
Mr.
Osmond
answered
,
with
a
laugh
which
,
though
it
*NL*
had
something
of
a
mocking
ring
,
had
also
a
finer
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
that
!
I
'm
sure
she
'll
see
no
harm
in
*NL*
me
but
what
you
tell
her
.
I
'm
better
than
he
says
,
Miss
Archer
,
''
the
*NL*
Countess
went
on
.
``
I
'm
only
rather
an
idiot
and
a
bore
.
Is
that
all
he
*NL*
has
said
?
Ah
then
,
you
keep
him
in
good-humour
.
Has
he
opened
on
one
of
*NL*
his
favourite
subjects
?
I
give
you
notice
that
there
are
two
or
three
*NL*
that
he
treats
a
fond
.
In
that
case
you
had
better
take
off
your
*NL*
bonnet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
know
what
Mr.
Osmond
's
favourite
subjects
are
,
''
said
*NL*
Isabel
,
who
had
risen
to
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
assumed
for
an
instant
an
attitude
of
intense
meditation
,
*NL*
pressing
one
of
her
hands
,
with
the
finger-tips
gathered
together
,
to
*NL*
her
forehead
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
in
a
moment
.
One
's
Machiavelli
;
the
other
's
*NL*
Vittoria
Colonna
;
the
next
is
Metastasio
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
with
me
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
,
passing
her
arm
into
the
Countess
*NL*
Gemini
's
as
if
to
guide
her
course
to
the
garden
,
``
Mr.
Osmond
's
never
so
*NL*
historical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
,
''
the
Countess
answered
as
they
moved
away
,
``
you
yourself
are
*NL*
Machiavelli
--
you
yourself
are
Vittoria
Colonna
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
hear
next
that
poor
Madame
Merle
is
Metastasio
!
''
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
resignedly
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
had
got
up
on
the
assumption
that
they
too
were
to
go
into
the
*NL*
garden
;
but
her
host
stood
there
with
no
apparent
inclination
to
leave
*NL*
the
room
,
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
jacket
and
his
daughter
,
who
*NL*
had
now
locked
her
arm
into
one
of
his
own
,
clinging
to
him
and
looking
*NL*
up
while
her
eyes
moved
from
his
own
face
to
Isabel
's
.
Isabel
waited
,
*NL*
with
a
certain
unuttered
contentedness
,
to
have
her
movements
directed
;
*NL*
she
liked
Mr.
Osmond
's
talk
,
his
company
:
she
had
what
always
gave
her
*NL*
a
very
private
thrill
,
the
consciousness
of
a
new
relation
.
Through
*NL*
the
open
doors
of
the
great
room
she
saw
Madame
Merle
and
the
Countess
*NL*
stroll
across
the
fine
grass
of
the
garden
;
then
she
turned
,
and
her
*NL*
eyes
wandered
over
the
things
scattered
about
her
.
The
understanding
*NL*
had
been
that
Mr.
Osmond
should
show
her
his
treasures
;
his
pictures
and
*NL*
cabinets
all
looked
like
treasures
.
Isabel
after
a
moment
went
toward
*NL*
one
of
the
pictures
to
see
it
better
;
but
just
as
she
had
done
so
he
*NL*
said
to
her
abruptly
:
``
Miss
Archer
,
what
do
you
think
of
my
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
faced
him
with
some
surprise
.
``
Ah
,
do
n't
ask
me
that
--
I
've
seen
your
*NL*
sister
too
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
've
seen
her
very
little
;
but
you
must
have
observed
that
*NL*
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
her
to
see
.
What
do
you
think
of
our
family
*NL*
tone
?
''
he
went
on
with
his
cool
smile
.
``
I
should
like
to
know
how
*NL*
it
strikes
a
fresh
,
unprejudiced
mind
.
I
know
what
you
're
going
to
*NL*
say
--
you
've
had
almost
no
observation
of
it
.
Of
course
this
is
only
*NL*
a
glimpse
.
But
just
take
notice
,
in
future
,
if
you
have
a
chance
.
I
*NL*
sometimes
think
we
've
got
into
a
rather
bad
way
,
living
off
here
among
*NL*
things
and
people
not
our
own
,
without
responsibilities
or
attachments
,
*NL*
with
nothing
to
hold
us
together
or
keep
us
up
;
marrying
foreigners
,
*NL*
forming
artificial
tastes
,
playing
tricks
with
our
natural
mission
.
Let
*NL*
me
add
,
though
,
that
I
say
that
much
more
for
myself
than
for
my
sister
.
*NL*
She
's
a
very
honest
lady
--
more
so
than
she
seems
.
She
's
rather
*NL*
unhappy
,
and
as
she
's
not
of
a
serious
turn
she
does
n't
tend
to
show
*NL*
it
tragically
:
she
shows
it
comically
instead
.
She
has
got
a
horrid
*NL*
husband
,
though
I
'm
not
sure
she
makes
the
best
of
him
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
however
,
a
horrid
husband
's
an
awkward
thing
.
Madame
Merle
gives
her
*NL*
excellent
advice
,
but
it
's
a
good
deal
like
giving
a
child
a
dictionary
*NL*
to
learn
a
language
with
.
He
can
look
out
the
words
,
but
he
ca
n't
put
*NL*
them
together
.
My
sister
needs
a
grammar
,
but
unfortunately
she
's
not
*NL*
grammatical
.
Pardon
my
troubling
you
with
these
details
;
my
sister
was
*NL*
very
right
in
saying
you
've
been
taken
into
the
family
.
Let
me
take
down
*NL*
that
picture
;
you
want
more
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
down
the
picture
,
carried
it
toward
the
window
,
related
some
*NL*
curious
facts
about
it
.
She
looked
at
the
other
works
of
art
,
and
he
*NL*
gave
her
such
further
information
as
might
appear
most
acceptable
to
*NL*
a
young
lady
making
a
call
on
a
summer
afternoon
.
His
pictures
,
his
*NL*
medallions
and
tapestries
were
interesting
;
but
after
a
while
Isabel
*NL*
felt
the
owner
much
more
so
,
and
independently
of
them
,
thickly
as
they
*NL*
seemed
to
overhang
him
.
He
resembled
no
one
she
had
ever
seen
;
most
*NL*
of
the
people
she
knew
might
be
divided
into
groups
of
half
a
dozen
*NL*
specimens
.
There
were
one
or
two
exceptions
to
this
;
she
could
think
for
*NL*
instance
of
no
group
that
would
contain
her
aunt
Lydia
.
There
were
other
*NL*
people
who
were
,
relatively
speaking
,
original
--
original
,
as
one
might
*NL*
say
,
by
courtesy
such
as
Mr.
Goodwood
,
as
her
cousin
Ralph
,
as
Henrietta
*NL*
Stackpole
,
as
Lord
Warburton
,
as
Madame
Merle
.
But
in
essentials
,
when
*NL*
one
came
to
look
at
them
,
these
individuals
belonged
to
types
already
*NL*
present
to
her
mind
.
Her
mind
contained
no
class
offering
a
natural
*NL*
place
to
Mr.
Osmond
--
he
was
a
specimen
apart
.
It
was
not
that
she
*NL*
recognised
all
these
truths
at
the
hour
,
but
they
were
falling
into
*NL*
order
before
her
.
For
the
moment
she
only
said
to
herself
that
this
``
new
*NL*
relation
''
would
perhaps
prove
her
very
most
distinguished
.
Madame
Merle
*NL*
had
had
that
note
of
rarity
,
but
what
quite
other
power
it
immediately
*NL*
gained
when
sounded
by
a
man
!
It
was
not
so
much
what
he
said
and
did
,
*NL*
but
rather
what
he
withheld
,
that
marked
him
for
her
as
by
one
of
those
*NL*
signs
of
the
highly
curious
that
he
was
showing
her
on
the
underside
of
*NL*
old
plates
and
in
the
corner
of
sixteenth-century
drawings
:
he
indulged
*NL*
in
no
striking
deflections
from
common
usage
,
he
was
an
original
without
*NL*
being
an
eccentric
.
She
had
never
met
a
person
of
so
fine
a
grain
.
*NL*
The
peculiarity
was
physical
,
to
begin
with
,
and
it
extended
to
*NL*
impalpabilities
.
His
dense
,
delicate
hair
,
his
overdrawn
,
retouched
*NL*
features
,
his
clear
complexion
,
ripe
without
being
coarse
,
the
very
*NL*
evenness
of
the
growth
of
his
beard
,
and
that
light
,
smooth
slenderness
*NL*
of
structure
which
made
the
movement
of
a
single
one
of
his
fingers
*NL*
produce
the
effect
of
an
expressive
gesture
--
these
personal
points
*NL*
struck
our
sensitive
young
woman
as
signs
of
quality
,
of
intensity
,
*NL*
somehow
as
promises
of
interest
.
He
was
certainly
fastidious
and
*NL*
critical
;
he
was
probably
irritable
.
His
sensibility
had
governed
*NL*
him
--
possibly
governed
him
too
much
;
it
had
made
him
impatient
of
*NL*
vulgar
troubles
and
had
led
him
to
live
by
himself
,
in
a
sorted
,
sifted
,
*NL*
arranged
world
,
thinking
about
art
and
beauty
and
history
.
He
had
*NL*
consulted
his
taste
in
everything
--
his
taste
alone
perhaps
,
as
a
sick
*NL*
man
consciously
incurable
consults
at
last
only
his
lawyer
:
that
was
*NL*
what
made
him
so
different
from
every
one
else
.
Ralph
had
something
of
*NL*
this
same
quality
,
this
appearance
of
thinking
that
life
was
a
matter
*NL*
of
connoisseurship
;
but
in
Ralph
it
was
an
anomaly
,
a
kind
of
humorous
*NL*
excrescence
,
whereas
in
Mr.
Osmond
it
was
the
keynote
,
and
everything
*NL*
was
in
harmony
with
it
.
She
was
certainly
far
from
understanding
him
*NL*
completely
;
his
meaning
was
not
at
all
times
obvious
.
It
was
hard
to
see
*NL*
what
he
meant
for
instance
by
speaking
of
his
provincial
side
--
which
*NL*
was
exactly
the
side
she
would
have
taken
him
most
to
lack
.
Was
it
a
*NL*
harmless
paradox
,
intended
to
puzzle
her
?
or
was
it
the
last
refinement
*NL*
of
high
culture
?
She
trusted
she
should
learn
in
time
;
it
would
be
very
*NL*
interesting
to
learn
.
If
it
was
provincial
to
have
that
harmony
,
what
*NL*
then
was
the
finish
of
the
capital
?
And
she
could
put
this
question
*NL*
in
spite
of
so
feeling
her
host
a
shy
personage
;
since
such
shyness
as
*NL*
his
--
the
shyness
of
ticklish
nerves
and
fine
perceptions
--
was
perfectly
*NL*
consistent
with
the
best
breeding
.
Indeed
it
was
almost
a
proof
of
*NL*
standards
and
touchstones
other
than
the
vulgar
:
he
must
be
so
sure
the
*NL*
vulgar
would
be
first
on
the
ground
.
He
was
n't
a
man
of
easy
assurance
,
*NL*
who
chatted
and
gossiped
with
the
fluency
of
a
superficial
nature
;
he
*NL*
was
critical
of
himself
as
well
as
of
others
,
and
,
exacting
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
others
,
to
think
them
agreeable
,
probably
took
a
rather
ironical
view
*NL*
of
what
he
himself
offered
:
a
proof
into
the
bargain
that
he
was
not
*NL*
grossly
conceited
.
If
he
had
not
been
shy
he
would
n't
have
effected
that
*NL*
gradual
,
subtle
,
successful
conversion
of
it
to
which
she
owed
both
what
*NL*
pleased
her
in
him
and
what
mystified
her
.
If
he
had
suddenly
asked
her
*NL*
what
she
thought
of
the
Countess
Gemini
,
that
was
doubtless
a
proof
that
*NL*
he
was
interested
in
her
;
it
could
scarcely
be
as
a
help
to
knowledge
*NL*
of
his
own
sister
.
That
he
should
be
so
interested
showed
an
enquiring
*NL*
mind
;
but
it
was
a
little
singular
he
should
sacrifice
his
fraternal
*NL*
feeling
to
his
curiosity
.
This
was
the
most
eccentric
thing
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
other
rooms
,
beyond
the
one
in
which
she
had
been
*NL*
received
,
equally
full
of
romantic
objects
,
and
in
these
apartments
*NL*
Isabel
spent
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
Everything
was
in
the
last
degree
*NL*
curious
and
precious
,
and
Mr.
Osmond
continued
to
be
the
kindest
of
*NL*
ciceroni
as
he
led
her
from
one
fine
piece
to
another
and
still
held
his
*NL*
little
girl
by
the
hand
.
His
kindness
almost
surprised
our
young
friend
,
*NL*
who
wondered
why
he
should
take
so
much
trouble
for
her
;
and
she
was
*NL*
oppressed
at
last
with
the
accumulation
of
beauty
and
knowledge
to
which
*NL*
she
found
herself
introduced
.
There
was
enough
for
the
present
;
she
had
*NL*
ceased
to
attend
to
what
he
said
;
she
listened
to
him
with
attentive
*NL*
eyes
,
but
was
not
thinking
of
what
he
told
her
.
He
probably
thought
*NL*
her
quicker
,
cleverer
in
every
way
,
more
prepared
,
than
she
was
.
Madame
*NL*
Merle
would
have
pleasantly
exaggerated
;
which
was
a
pity
,
because
in
*NL*
the
end
he
would
be
sure
to
find
out
,
and
then
perhaps
even
her
real
*NL*
intelligence
would
n't
reconcile
him
to
his
mistake
.
A
part
of
Isabel
's
*NL*
fatigue
came
from
the
effort
to
appear
as
intelligent
as
she
believed
*NL*
Madame
Merle
had
described
her
,
and
from
the
fear
-LRB-
very
unusual
with
*NL*
her
-RRB-
of
exposing
--
not
her
ignorance
;
for
that
she
cared
comparatively
*NL*
little
--
but
her
possible
grossness
of
perception
.
It
would
have
annoyed
*NL*
her
to
express
a
liking
for
something
he
,
in
his
superior
enlightenment
,
*NL*
would
think
she
ought
n't
to
like
;
or
to
pass
by
something
at
which
the
*NL*
truly
initiated
mind
would
arrest
itself
.
She
had
no
wish
to
fall
into
*NL*
that
grotesqueness
--
in
which
she
had
seen
women
-LRB-
and
it
was
a
warning
-RRB-
*NL*
serenely
,
yet
ignobly
,
flounder
.
She
was
very
careful
therefore
as
to
*NL*
what
she
said
,
as
to
what
she
noticed
or
failed
to
notice
;
more
careful
*NL*
than
she
had
ever
been
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
back
into
the
first
of
the
rooms
,
where
the
tea
had
been
*NL*
served
;
but
as
the
two
other
ladies
were
still
on
the
terrace
,
and
as
*NL*
Isabel
had
not
yet
been
made
acquainted
with
the
view
,
the
paramount
*NL*
distinction
of
the
place
,
Mr.
Osmond
directed
her
steps
into
the
garden
*NL*
without
more
delay
.
Madame
Merle
and
the
Countess
had
had
chairs
brought
*NL*
out
,
and
as
the
afternoon
was
lovely
the
Countess
proposed
they
should
*NL*
take
their
tea
in
the
open
air
.
Pansy
therefore
was
sent
to
bid
the
*NL*
servant
bring
out
the
preparations
.
The
sun
had
got
low
,
the
golden
*NL*
light
took
a
deeper
tone
,
and
on
the
mountains
and
the
plain
that
*NL*
stretched
beneath
them
the
masses
of
purple
shadow
glowed
as
richly
*NL*
as
the
places
that
were
still
exposed
.
The
scene
had
an
extraordinary
*NL*
charm
.
The
air
was
almost
solemnly
still
,
and
the
large
expanse
of
the
*NL*
landscape
,
with
its
garden-like
culture
and
nobleness
of
outline
,
*NL*
its
teeming
valley
and
delicately-fretted
hills
,
its
peculiarly
*NL*
human-looking
touches
of
habitation
,
lay
there
in
splendid
harmony
and
*NL*
classic
grace
.
``
You
seem
so
well
pleased
that
I
think
you
can
be
trusted
*NL*
to
come
back
,
''
Osmond
said
as
he
led
his
companion
to
one
of
the
angles
*NL*
of
the
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
certainly
come
back
,
''
she
returned
,
``
in
spite
of
what
you
say
*NL*
about
its
being
bad
to
live
in
Italy
.
What
was
that
you
said
about
one
's
*NL*
natural
mission
?
I
wonder
if
I
should
forsake
my
natural
mission
if
I
*NL*
were
to
settle
in
Florence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
's
natural
mission
is
to
be
where
she
's
most
appreciated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
point
's
to
find
out
where
that
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
--
she
often
wastes
a
great
deal
of
time
in
the
enquiry
.
People
*NL*
ought
to
make
it
very
plain
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
matter
would
have
to
be
made
very
plain
to
me
,
''
smiled
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
,
at
any
rate
,
to
hear
you
talk
of
settling
.
Madame
Merle
had
*NL*
given
me
an
idea
that
you
were
of
a
rather
roving
disposition
.
I
thought
*NL*
she
spoke
of
your
having
some
plan
of
going
round
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
rather
ashamed
of
my
plans
;
I
make
a
new
one
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
be
ashamed
;
it
's
the
greatest
of
pleasures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
frivolous
,
I
think
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
One
ought
to
choose
*NL*
something
very
deliberately
,
and
be
faithful
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
that
rule
then
,
I
've
not
been
frivolous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
never
made
plans
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
made
one
years
ago
,
and
I
'm
acting
on
it
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
have
been
a
very
pleasant
one
,
''
Isabel
permitted
herself
to
*NL*
observe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
very
simple
.
It
was
to
be
as
quiet
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
quiet
?
''
the
girl
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
worry
--
not
to
strive
nor
struggle
.
To
resign
myself
.
To
be
*NL*
content
with
little
.
''
He
spoke
these
sentences
slowly
,
with
short
pauses
*NL*
between
,
and
his
intelligent
regard
was
fixed
on
his
visitor
's
with
the
*NL*
conscious
air
of
a
man
who
has
brought
himself
to
confess
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
that
simple
?
''
she
asked
with
mild
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
because
it
's
negative
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
your
life
been
negative
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
it
affirmative
if
you
like
.
Only
it
has
affirmed
my
indifference
.
*NL*
Mind
you
,
not
my
natural
indifference
--
I
HAD
none
.
But
my
studied
,
my
*NL*
wilful
renunciation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
scarcely
understood
him
;
it
seemed
a
question
whether
he
were
*NL*
joking
or
not
.
Why
should
a
man
who
struck
her
as
having
a
great
fund
*NL*
of
reserve
suddenly
bring
himself
to
be
so
confidential
?
This
was
his
*NL*
affair
,
however
,
and
his
confidences
were
interesting
.
``
I
do
n't
see
why
*NL*
you
should
have
renounced
,
''
she
said
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
could
do
nothing
.
I
had
no
prospects
,
I
was
poor
,
and
I
was
*NL*
not
a
man
of
genius
.
I
had
no
talents
even
;
I
took
my
measure
early
in
*NL*
life
.
I
was
simply
the
most
fastidious
young
gentleman
living
.
There
*NL*
were
two
or
three
people
in
the
world
I
envied
--
the
Emperor
of
Russia
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
and
the
Sultan
of
Turkey
!
There
were
even
moments
when
I
*NL*
envied
the
Pope
of
Rome
--
for
the
consideration
he
enjoys
.
I
should
have
*NL*
been
delighted
to
be
considered
to
that
extent
;
but
since
that
could
n't
*NL*
be
I
did
n't
care
for
anything
less
,
and
I
made
up
my
mind
not
to
go
*NL*
in
for
honours
.
The
leanest
gentleman
can
always
consider
himself
,
*NL*
and
fortunately
I
was
,
though
lean
,
a
gentleman
.
I
could
do
nothing
in
*NL*
Italy
--
I
could
n't
even
be
an
Italian
patriot
.
To
do
that
I
should
have
*NL*
had
to
get
out
of
the
country
;
and
I
was
too
fond
of
it
to
leave
it
,
to
*NL*
say
nothing
of
my
being
too
well
satisfied
with
it
,
on
the
whole
,
as
it
*NL*
then
was
,
to
wish
it
altered
.
So
I
've
passed
a
great
many
years
here
on
*NL*
that
quiet
plan
I
spoke
of
.
I
've
not
been
at
all
unhappy
.
I
do
n't
mean
*NL*
to
say
I
've
cared
for
nothing
;
but
the
things
I
've
cared
for
have
*NL*
been
definite
--
limited
.
The
events
of
my
life
have
been
absolutely
*NL*
unperceived
by
any
one
save
myself
;
getting
an
old
silver
crucifix
at
a
*NL*
bargain
-LRB-
I
've
never
bought
anything
dear
,
of
course
-RRB-
,
or
discovering
,
*NL*
as
I
once
did
,
a
sketch
by
Correggio
on
a
panel
daubed
over
by
some
*NL*
inspired
idiot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
would
have
been
rather
a
dry
account
of
Mr.
Osmond
's
career
if
*NL*
Isabel
had
fully
believed
it
;
but
her
imagination
supplied
the
human
*NL*
element
which
she
was
sure
had
not
been
wanting
.
His
life
had
been
*NL*
mingled
with
other
lives
more
than
he
admitted
;
naturally
she
could
n't
*NL*
expect
him
to
enter
into
this
.
For
the
present
she
abstained
from
*NL*
provoking
further
revelations
;
to
intimate
that
he
had
not
told
her
*NL*
everything
would
be
more
familiar
and
less
considerate
than
she
now
*NL*
desired
to
be
--
would
in
fact
be
uproariously
vulgar
.
He
had
certainly
*NL*
told
her
quite
enough
.
It
was
her
present
inclination
,
however
,
to
*NL*
express
a
measured
sympathy
for
the
success
with
which
he
had
preserved
*NL*
his
independence
.
``
That
's
a
very
pleasant
life
,
''
she
said
,
``
to
renounce
*NL*
everything
but
Correggio
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
made
in
my
way
a
good
thing
of
it
.
Do
n't
imagine
I
'm
whining
*NL*
about
it
.
It
's
one
's
own
fault
if
one
is
n't
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
large
;
she
kept
down
to
something
smaller
.
``
Have
you
lived
here
*NL*
always
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
always
.
I
lived
a
long
time
at
Naples
,
and
many
years
in
*NL*
Rome
.
But
I
've
been
here
a
good
while
.
Perhaps
I
shall
have
to
change
,
*NL*
however
;
to
do
something
else
.
I
've
no
longer
myself
to
think
of
.
My
*NL*
daughter
's
growing
up
and
may
very
possibly
not
care
so
much
for
the
*NL*
Correggios
and
crucifixes
as
I.
I
shall
have
to
do
what
's
best
for
*NL*
Pansy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
do
that
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
She
's
such
a
dear
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
cried
Gilbert
Osmond
beautifully
,
``
she
's
a
little
saint
of
heaven
!
*NL*
She
is
my
great
happiness
!

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
sufficiently
intimate
colloquy
-LRB-
prolonged
for
some
time
after
*NL*
we
cease
to
follow
it
-RRB-
went
forward
Madame
Merle
and
her
companion
,
*NL*
breaking
a
silence
of
some
duration
,
had
begun
to
exchange
remarks
.
*NL*
They
were
sitting
in
an
attitude
of
unexpressed
expectancy
;
an
attitude
*NL*
especially
marked
on
the
part
of
the
Countess
Gemini
,
who
,
being
of
a
*NL*
more
nervous
temperament
than
her
friend
,
practised
with
less
success
*NL*
the
art
of
disguising
impatience
.
What
these
ladies
were
waiting
for
*NL*
would
not
have
been
apparent
and
was
perhaps
not
very
definite
to
their
*NL*
own
minds
.
Madame
Merle
waited
for
Osmond
to
release
their
young
friend
*NL*
from
her
tete-a-tete
,
and
the
Countess
waited
because
Madame
Merle
did
.
*NL*
The
Countess
,
moreover
,
by
waiting
,
found
the
time
ripe
for
one
of
her
*NL*
pretty
perversities
.
She
might
have
desired
for
some
minutes
to
place
*NL*
it
.
Her
brother
wandered
with
Isabel
to
the
end
of
the
garden
,
to
which
*NL*
point
her
eyes
followed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
she
then
observed
to
her
companion
,
``
you
'll
excuse
me
if
I
*NL*
do
n't
congratulate
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
willingly
,
for
I
do
n't
in
the
least
know
why
you
should
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
a
little
plan
that
you
think
rather
well
of
?
''
And
the
*NL*
Countess
nodded
at
the
sequestered
couple
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
's
eyes
took
the
same
direction
;
then
she
looked
serenely
at
*NL*
her
neighbour
.
``
You
know
I
never
understand
you
very
well
,
''
she
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
can
understand
better
than
you
when
you
wish
.
I
see
that
just
*NL*
now
you
DO
N'T
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
things
to
me
that
no
one
else
does
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
gravely
,
*NL*
yet
without
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
things
you
do
n't
like
?
Does
n't
Osmond
sometimes
say
such
*NL*
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
your
brother
says
has
a
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
poisoned
one
sometimes
.
If
you
mean
that
I
'm
not
so
clever
as
he
*NL*
you
must
n't
think
I
shall
suffer
from
your
sense
of
our
difference
.
But
*NL*
it
will
be
much
better
that
you
should
understand
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
asked
Madame
Merle
.
``
To
what
will
it
conduce
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
do
n't
approve
of
your
plan
you
ought
to
know
it
in
order
to
*NL*
appreciate
the
danger
of
my
interfering
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
looked
as
if
she
were
ready
to
admit
that
there
might
be
*NL*
something
in
this
;
but
in
a
moment
she
said
quietly
:
``
You
think
me
more
*NL*
calculating
than
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
your
calculating
I
think
ill
of
;
it
's
your
calculating
wrong
.
*NL*
You
've
done
so
in
this
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
made
extensive
calculations
yourself
to
discover
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
not
had
time
.
I
've
seen
the
girl
but
this
once
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Countess
,
``
and
the
conviction
has
suddenly
come
to
me
.
I
like
her
very
*NL*
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
,
''
Madame
Merle
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
a
strange
way
of
showing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
I
've
given
her
the
advantage
of
making
your
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
indeed
,
''
piped
the
Countess
,
``
is
perhaps
the
best
thing
that
could
*NL*
happen
to
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
said
nothing
for
some
time
.
The
Countess
's
manner
was
*NL*
odious
,
was
really
low
;
but
it
was
an
old
story
,
and
with
her
eyes
upon
*NL*
the
violet
slope
of
Monte
Morello
she
gave
herself
up
to
reflection
.
``
My
*NL*
dear
lady
,
''
she
finally
resumed
,
``
I
advise
you
not
to
agitate
yourself
.
*NL*
The
matter
you
allude
to
concerns
three
persons
much
stronger
of
purpose
*NL*
than
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
persons
?
You
and
Osmond
of
course
.
But
is
Miss
Archer
also
very
*NL*
strong
of
purpose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
as
much
so
as
we
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
,
''
said
the
Countess
radiantly
,
``
if
I
convince
her
it
's
her
*NL*
interest
to
resist

'll
do
so
successfully
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Resist
us

Why
do
you
express
yourself
so
coarsely

She
's
not
exposed

to
compulsion

deception

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
of
that

You
're
capable
of
anything

you

Osmond

I
*NL*
do

mean
Osmond
by
himself
,
and
I
do
n't
mean
you
by
yourself

But
*NL*
together
you
're
dangerous

like
some
chemical
combination

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
leave
us
alone
then
,
''
smiled
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

to
touch
you

but
I
shall
talk
to
that
girl

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
Amy

Madame
Merle
murmured
,
``
I
do
n't
see
what
has
got
into
*NL*
your
head

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
an
interest
in
her

that
's
what

into
my

her

*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
hesitated
a
moment
.
``
I
do
n't
think
she
likes
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
's
bright
little
eyes
expanded
and
her
face
was
set
in
a
*NL*
grimace
.
``
Ah
,
you
ARE
dangerous
--
even
by
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
want
her
to
like
you

abuse
your
brother
to
her

said
*NL*
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
suppose
you
pretend
she
has
fallen
in
love
with
him
in
two
*NL*
interviews
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
looked
a
moment
at
Isabel
and
at
the
master
of
the
house
.
*NL*
He
was
leaning
against
the
parapet
,
facing
her
,
his
arms
folded
;
and
*NL*
she
at
present
was
evidently
not
lost
in
the
mere
impersonal
view
,
*NL*
persistently
as
she
gazed
at
it
.
As
Madame
Merle
watched
her
she
lowered
*NL*
her
eyes
;
she
was
listening
,
possibly
with
a
certain
embarrassment
,
*NL*
while
she
pressed
the
point
of
her
parasol
into
the
path
.
Madame
Merle
*NL*
rose
from
her
chair
.
``
Yes
,
I
think
so
!
''
she
pronounced
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shabby
footboy
,
summoned
by
Pansy
--
he
might
,
tarnished
as
to
livery
*NL*
and
quaint
as
to
type
,
have
issued
from
some
stray
sketch
of
old-time
*NL*
manners
,
been
``
put
in
''
by
the
brush
of
a
Longhi
or
a
Goya
--
had
come
out
*NL*
with
a
small
table
and
placed
it
on
the
grass
,
and
then
had
gone
back
*NL*
and
fetched
the
tea-tray
;
after
which
he
had
again
disappeared
,
to
*NL*
return
with
a
couple
of
chairs
.
Pansy
had
watched
these
proceedings
with
*NL*
the
deepest
interest
,
standing
with
her
small
hands
folded
together
*NL*
upon
the
front
of
her
scanty
frock
;
but
she
had
not
presumed
to
offer
*NL*
assistance
.
When
the
tea-table
had
been
arranged
,
however
,
she
gently
*NL*
approached
her
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
papa
would
object
to
my
making
the
tea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
looked
at
her
with
a
deliberately
critical
gaze
and
without
*NL*
answering
her
question
.
``
My
poor
niece
,
''
she
said
,
``
is
that
your
best
*NL*
frock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
no
,
''
Pansy
answered
,
``
it
's
just
a
little
toilette
for
common
*NL*
occasions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
it
a
common
occasion
when
I
come
to
see
you
?
--
to
say
*NL*
nothing
of
Madame
Merle
and
the
pretty
lady
yonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
reflected
a
moment
,
turning
gravely
from
one
of
the
persons
*NL*
mentioned
to
the
other
.
Then
her
face
broke
into
its
perfect
smile
.
*NL*
``
I
have
a
pretty
dress
,
but
even
that
one
's
very
simple
.
Why
should
I
*NL*
expose
it
beside
your
beautiful
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
's
the
prettiest
you
have
;
for
me
you
must
always
wear
the
*NL*
prettiest
.
Please
put
it
on
the
next
time
.
It
seems
to
me
they
do
n't
*NL*
dress
you
so
well
as
they
might
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
sparingly
stroked
down
her
antiquated
skirt
.
``
It
's
a
good
*NL*
little
dress
to
make
tea

do
n't
you
think
?
Do
n't
you
believe
papa
would
*NL*
allow
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
for
me
to
say

my
child

''
said
the
Countess
.
``
For
me

your
*NL*
father

ideas

unfathomable

them
better

HER

''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
smiled
with
her
usual
grace
.
``
It
's
a
weighty
question

let
*NL*
me
think

It
seems
to
me
it
would
please
your
father
to
see
a
careful
*NL*
little
daughter
making
his
tea
.
It
's
the
proper
duty
of
the
daughter
of
*NL*
the
house
--
when
she
grows
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
seems
to
me
,
Madame
Merle
!

Pansy
cried
.
``
You
shall
see
how
well
*NL*
I
'll
make
it
.
A
spoonful
for
each

And
she
began
to
busy
herself
at
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
spoonfuls
for
me
,
''
said
the
Countess
,
who
,
with
Madame
Merle
,
*NL*
remained
for
some
moments
watching
her
.
``
Listen
to
me
,
Pansy
,
''
the
*NL*
Countess
resumed
at
last
.
``
I
should
like
to
know
what
you
think
of
your
*NL*
visitor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
she
's
not
mine

she

Pansy
objected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Archer
came
to
see
you
as
well

said
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

very
happy

polite

*NL*
``
Do

the
Countess
asked

*NL*
*NL*
``

Pansy
repeated
in
her
little
neat

conversational
tone

She
pleases
me
thoroughly

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you

your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

murmured
Madame
Merle
dissuasively
.
``
Go
and
call
*NL*
them
to
tea

she
went
on
to
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
see
if

Pansy
declared
;
and
departed
to
*NL*
summon
the
others
,
who
had
still
lingered
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Miss
Archer
's
to
become
her
mother
it
's
surely
interesting

know

said
the
Countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your

again
it

Madame
*NL*
Merle
replied
.
``
She
'll
soon
be
sixteen

after
that

*NL*
*NL*

provide
the

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

cried
the
Countess

``
Why

such
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

``
There

Madame

closed
her
eyes
a
moment
.
``
You
're
irritated
just
now

I
*NL*
do
n't
know
why

she
presently
said

comes
for

as

'm
confident
that
we

shall
some
day
have
the
pleasure

looking

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

the
Countess
answered

``
You
often
irritate

Your

coolness
is
fabulous

You

a
strange
woman

*NL*
``
It
's
much
better
that

always
act
together

Madame

went
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
that
as
a
threat
?
''
asked
the
Countess
rising
.
Madame
*NL*
Merle
shook
her
head
as
for
quiet
amusement
.
``
No
indeed
,
you
've
not
my
*NL*
coolness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
and
Mr.
Osmond
were
now
slowly
coming
toward
them
and
Isabel
*NL*
had
taken
Pansy
by
the
hand
.
``
Do
you
pretend
to
believe
he
'd
make
her
*NL*
happy
?
''
the
Countess
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
should
marry
Miss
Archer
I
suppose
he
'd
behave
like
a
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
jerked
herself
into
a
succession
of
attitudes
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
mean
as
most
gentlemen
behave
?
That
would
be
much
to
be
thankful
for
!
Of
*NL*
course
Osmond
's
a
gentleman
;
his
own
sister
need
n't
be
reminded
of
that
.
*NL*
But
does
he
think
he
can
marry
any
girl
he
happens
to
pick
out
?
Osmond
's
*NL*
a
gentleman
,
of
course
;
but
I
must
say
I
've
NEVER
,
no
,
no
,
never
,
seen
*NL*
any
one
of
Osmond
's
pretensions
!
What
they
're
all
founded
on
is
more
*NL*
than
I
can
say
.
I
'm
his
own
sister
;
I
might
be
supposed
to
know
.
Who
*NL*
is
he
,
if
you
please
?
What
has
he
ever
done
?
If
there
had
been
anything
*NL*
particularly
grand
in
his
origin
--
if
he
were
made
of
some
superior
*NL*
clay
--
I
presume
I
should
have
got
some
inkling
of
it
.
If
there
had
been
*NL*
any
great
honours
or
splendours
in
the
family
I
should
certainly
have
*NL*
made
the
most
of
them
:
they
would
have
been
quite
in
my
line
.
But
*NL*
there
's
nothing
,
nothing
,
nothing
.
One
's
parents
were
charming
people
of
*NL*
course
;
but
so
were
yours
,
I
've
no
doubt
.
Every
one
's
a
charming
person
*NL*
nowadays
.
Even
I
'm
a
charming
person
;
do
n't
laugh
,
it
has
literally
*NL*
been
said
.
As
for
Osmond
,
he
has
always
appeared
to
believe
that
he
's
*NL*
descended
from
the
gods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
say
what
you
please

''
said
Madame
Merle
,
who
had
listened
to
*NL*
this
quick
outbreak
none
the
less
attentively
,
we
may
believe
,
because
*NL*
her
eye
wandered
away
from
the
speaker
and
her
hands
busied
themselves
*NL*
with
adjusting
the
knots
of
ribbon
on
her
dress
.
``
You
Osmonds
are
a
fine
*NL*
race

your
blood
must
flow
from
some
very
pure
source

Your

,
*NL*
like
an
intelligent
man

has
had
the
conviction
of
it
if
he
has
not
*NL*
had
the
proofs

You
're
modest
about
it

but
you
yourself
are
extremely
*NL*
distinguished

What
do
you
say
about
your
niece

The
child
's
a
little

princess

Nevertheless

Madame

added
,
``
it

I

returned
the

went
forward
a
little
to

the

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
Gilbert
Osmond
came
to
see
Isabel
again
;
that
is
he
came
to
Palazzo
*NL*
Crescentini
.
He
had
other
friends
there
as
well
,
and
to
Mrs.
Touchett
*NL*
and
Madame
Merle
he
was
always
impartially
civil
;
but
the
former
of
*NL*
these
ladies
noted
the
fact
that
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
he
*NL*
called
five
times
,
and
compared
it
with
another
fact
that
she
found
no
*NL*
difficulty
in
remembering
.
Two
visits
a
year
had
hitherto
constituted
*NL*
his
regular
tribute
to
Mrs.
Touchett
's
worth
,
and
she
had
never
*NL*
observed
him
select
for
such
visits
those
moments
,
of
almost
periodical
*NL*
recurrence
,
when
Madame
Merle
was
under
her
roof
.
It
was
not
for
Madame
*NL*
Merle
that
he
came
;
these
two
were
old
friends
and
he
never
put
himself
*NL*
out
for
her
.
He
was
not
fond
of
Ralph
--
Ralph
had
told
her
so
--
and
it
was
*NL*
not
supposable
that
Mr.
Osmond
had
suddenly
taken
a
fancy
to
her
son
.
*NL*
Ralph
was
imperturbable
--
Ralph
had
a
kind
of
loose-fitting
urbanity
*NL*
that
wrapped
him
about
like
an
ill-made
overcoat
,
but
of
which
he
*NL*
never
divested
himself
;
he
thought
Mr.
Osmond
very
good
company
and
was
*NL*
willing
at
any
time
to
look
at
him
in
the
light
of
hospitality
.
But
he
*NL*
did
n't
flatter
himself
that
the
desire
to
repair
a
past
injustice
was
*NL*
the
motive
of
their
visitor
's
calls
;
he
read
the
situation
more
clearly
.
*NL*
Isabel
was
the
attraction
,
and
in
all
conscience
a
sufficient
one
.
*NL*
Osmond
was
a
critic
,
a
student
of
the
exquisite
,
and
it
was
natural
he
*NL*
should
be
curious
of
so
rare
an
apparition
.
So
when
his
mother
observed
*NL*
to
him
that
it
was
plain
what
Mr.
Osmond
was
thinking
of
,
Ralph
replied
*NL*
that
he
was
quite
of
her
opinion
.
Mrs.
Touchett
had
from
far
back
found
*NL*
a
place
on
her
scant
list
for
this
gentleman
,
though
wondering
dimly
by
*NL*
what
art
and
what
process
--
so
negative
and
so
wise
as
they
were
--
he
*NL*
had
everywhere
effectively
imposed
himself
.
As
he
had
never
been
an
*NL*
importunate
visitor
he
had
had
no
chance
to
be
offensive
,
and
he
was
*NL*
recommended
to
her
by
his
appearance
of
being
as
well
able
to
do
without
*NL*
her
as
she
was
to
do
without
him
--
a
quality
that
always
,
oddly
enough
,
*NL*
affected
her
as
providing
ground
for
a
relation
with
her
.
It
gave
her
*NL*
no
satisfaction
,
however
,
to
think
that
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
*NL*
marry
her
niece
.
Such
an
alliance
,
on
Isabel
's
part
,
would
have
an
air
*NL*
of
almost
morbid
perversity
.
Mrs.
Touchett
easily
remembered
that
the
*NL*
girl
had
refused
an
English
peer
;
and
that
a
young
lady
with
whom
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
had
not
successfully
wrestled
should
content
herself
with
an
*NL*
obscure
American
dilettante
,
a
middle-aged
widower
with
an
uncanny
child
*NL*
and
an
ambiguous
income
,
this
answered
to
nothing
in
Mrs.
Touchett
's
*NL*
conception
of
success
.
She
took
,
it
will
be
observed
,
not
the
*NL*
sentimental
,
but
the
political
,
view
of
matrimony
--
a
view
which
has
*NL*
always
had
much
to
recommend
it
.
``
I
trust
she
wo
n't
have
the
folly
*NL*
to
listen
to
him
,
''
she
said
to
her
son
;
to
which
Ralph
replied
that
*NL*
Isabel
's
listening
was
one
thing
and
Isabel
's
answering
quite
another
.
*NL*
He
knew
she
had
listened
to
several
parties
,
as
his
father
would
*NL*
have
said
,
but
had
made
them
listen
in
return
;
and
he
found
much
*NL*
entertainment
in
the
idea
that
in
these
few
months
of
his
knowing
her
he
*NL*
should
observe
a
fresh
suitor
at
her
gate
.
She
had
wanted
to
see
life
,
*NL*
and
fortune
was
serving
her
to
her
taste
;
a
succession
of
fine
gentlemen
*NL*
going
down
on
their
knees
to
her
would
do
as
well
as
anything
else
.
*NL*
Ralph
looked
forward
to
a
fourth
,
a
fifth
,
a
tenth
besieger
;
he
had
no
*NL*
conviction
she
would
stop
at
a
third
.
She
would
keep
the
gate
ajar
and
*NL*
open
a
parley
;
she
would
certainly
not
allow
number
three
to
come
in
.
*NL*
He
expressed
this
view
,
somewhat
after
this
fashion
,
to
his
mother
,
who
*NL*
looked
at
him
as
if
he
had
been
dancing
a
jig
.
He
had
such
a
fanciful
,
*NL*
pictorial
way
of
saying
things
that
he
might
as
well
address
her
in
the
*NL*
deaf-mute
's
alphabet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
know
what
you
mean
,
''
she
said
;
``
you
use
too
many
*NL*
figures
of
speech
;
I
could
never
understand
allegories
.
The
two
words
in
*NL*
the
language
I
most
respect
are
Yes
and
No
.
If
Isabel
wants
to
marry
Mr.
*NL*
Osmond
she
'll
do
so
in
spite
of
all
your
comparisons
.
Let
her
alone
to
*NL*
find
a
fine
one
herself
for
anything
she
undertakes
.
I
know
very
little
*NL*
about
the
young
man
in
America
;
I
do
n't
think
she
spends
much
of
her
*NL*
time
in
thinking
of
him
,
and
I
suspect
he
has
got
tired
of
waiting
for
*NL*
her
.
There
's
nothing
in
life
to
prevent
her
marrying
Mr.
Osmond
if
*NL*
she
only
looks
at
him
in
a
certain
way
.
That
's
all
very
well
;
no
one
*NL*
approves
more
than
I
of
one
's
pleasing
one
's
self
.
But
she
takes
her
*NL*
pleasure
in
such
odd
things
;
she
's
capable
of
marrying
Mr.
Osmond
for
*NL*
the
beauty
of
his
opinions
or
for
his
autograph
of
Michael
Angelo
.
*NL*
She
wants
to
be
disinterested
:
as
if
she
were
the
only
person
who
's
*NL*
in
danger
of
not
being
so
!
Will
HE
be
so
disinterested
when
he
has
the
*NL*
spending
of
her
money
?
That
was
her
idea
before
your
father
's
death
,
and
*NL*
it
has
acquired
new
charms
for
her
since
.
She
ought
to
marry
some
one
of
*NL*
whose
disinterestedness
she
shall
herself
be
sure
;
and
there
would
be
no
*NL*
such
proof
of
that
as
his
having
a
fortune
of
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
mother
,
I
'm
not
afraid
,
''
Ralph
answered
.
``
She
's
making
fools
of
*NL*
us
all
.
She
'll
please
herself
,
of
course
;
but
she
'll
do
so
by
studying
*NL*
human
nature
at
close
quarters
and
yet
retaining
her
liberty
.
She
has
*NL*
started
on
an
exploring
expedition
,
and
I
do
n't
think
she
'll
change
her
*NL*
course
,
at
the
outset
,
at
a
signal
from
Gilbert
Osmond
.
She
may
have
*NL*
slackened
speed
for
an
hour
,
but
before
we
know
it
she
'll
be
steaming
*NL*
away
again
.
Excuse
another
metaphor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
excused
it
perhaps
,
but
was
not
so
much
reassured
as
to
*NL*
withhold
from
Madame
Merle
the
expression
of
her
fears
.
``
You
who
*NL*
know
everything
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
must
know
this
:
whether
that
curious
*NL*
creature
's
really
making
love
to
my
niece
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gilbert
Osmond
?
''
Madame
Merle
widened
her
clear
eyes
and
,
with
a
full
*NL*
intelligence
,
``
Heaven
help
us
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
that
's
an
idea
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
n't
it
occurred
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
make
me
feel
an
idiot
,
but
I
confess
it
had
n't

I
wonder
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
``
if
it
has
occurred
to
Isabel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
shall
now
ask
her
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
reflected
.
``
Do
n't
put
it
into
her
head
.
The
thing
would
be
*NL*
to
ask
Mr.
Osmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
do
that
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
.
``
I
wo
n't
have
him
enquire
*NL*
of
me
--
as
he
perfectly
may
with
that
air
of
his
,
given
Isabel
's
*NL*
situation
--
what
business
it
is
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
ask
him
myself
,
''
Madame
Merle
bravely
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
business
--
for
HIM
--
is
it
of
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
being
none
whatever

just
why
I
can
afford
to
speak

It
's
so
*NL*
much
less
my
business
than
any
one
's
else
that
he
can
put
me
off
with
*NL*
anything
he
chooses
.
But
it
will
be
by
the
way
he
does
this
that
I
shall
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
let
me
hear
then
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
,
``
of
the
fruits
of
your
*NL*
penetration
.
If
I
ca
n't
speak
to
him
,
however
,
at

I
can
speak
to
*NL*
Isabel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
companion
sounded
at
this
the
note
of
warning
.
``
Do
n't
be
too
quick
*NL*
with
her
.
Do
n't
inflame
her
imagination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
did
anything
in

to
any
one

imagination

But
I
'm
always
*NL*
sure
of
her
doing
something
--
well
,
not
of
MY
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
would
n't
like
this
,
''
Madame
Merle
observed
without
the
point
of
*NL*
interrogation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
in
the
world
should
I
,
pray
?
Mr.
Osmond
has
nothing
the
least
solid
*NL*
to
offer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Madame
Merle
was
silent
while
her
thoughtful
smile
drew
up
her
*NL*
mouth
even
more
charmingly
than
usual
toward
the
left
corner
.
``
Let
us
*NL*
distinguish
.
Gilbert
Osmond
's
certainly
not
the
first
comer
.
He
's
a
man
*NL*
who
in
favourable
conditions
might
very
well
make
a
great
impression
.
He
*NL*
has
made
a
great
impression
,
to
my
knowledge
,
more
than
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tell
me
about
his
probably
quite
cold-blooded
love-affairs
;
*NL*
they
're
nothing
to
me
!
''
Mrs.
Touchett
cried
.
``
What
you
say
's
precisely
*NL*
why
I
wish
he
would
cease
his
visits
.
He
has
nothing
in
the
world
that
*NL*
I
know
of
but
a
dozen
or
two
of
early
masters
and
a
more
or
less
pert
*NL*
little
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
early
masters
are
now
worth
a
good
deal
of
money
,
''
said
Madame
*NL*
Merle
,
``
and
the
daughter
's
a
very
young
and
very
innocent
and
very
*NL*
harmless
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
other
words
she
's
an
insipid
little
chit
.
Is
that
what
you
mean
?
*NL*
Having
no
fortune
she
ca
n't
hope
to
marry
as
they
marry
here
;
so
that
*NL*
Isabel
will
have
to
furnish
her
either
with
a
maintenance
or
with
a
*NL*
dowry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabel
probably
would
n't
object
to
being
kind
to
her
.
I
think
she
likes
*NL*
the
poor
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
reason
then
for
Mr.
Osmond
's
stopping
at
home
!
Otherwise
,
a
*NL*
week
hence
,
we
shall
have
my
niece
arriving
at
the
conviction
that
her
*NL*
mission
in
life
's
to
prove
that
a
stepmother
may
sacrifice
herself
--
and
*NL*
that
,
to
prove
it
,
she
must
first
become
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
make
a
charming
stepmother
,
''
smiled
Madame
Merle
;
``
but
I
*NL*
quite
agree
with
you
that
she
had
better
not
decide
upon
her
mission
*NL*
too
hastily
.
Changing
the
form
of
one
's
mission
's
almost
as
difficult
as
*NL*
changing
the
shape
of
one
's
nose
:
there
they
are
,
each
,
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
one
's
face
and
one
's
character
--
one
has
to
begin
too
far
back
.
But
I
'll
*NL*
investigate
and
report
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
went
on
quite
over
Isabel
's
head
;
she
had
no
suspicions
that
*NL*
her
relations
with
Mr.
Osmond
were
being
discussed
.
Madame
Merle
had
*NL*
said
nothing
to
put
her
on
her
guard
;
she
alluded
no
more
pointedly
to
*NL*
him
than
to
the
other
gentlemen
of
Florence
,
native
and
foreign
,
who
now
*NL*
arrived
in
considerable
numbers
to
pay
their
respects
to
Miss
Archer
's
*NL*
aunt
.
Isabel
thought
him
interesting
--
she
came
back
to
that
;
she
liked
*NL*
so
to
think
of
him
.
She
had
carried
away
an
image
from
her
visit
to
his
*NL*
hill-top
which
her
subsequent
knowledge
of
him
did
nothing
to
efface
*NL*
and
which
put
on
for
her
a
particular
harmony
with
other
supposed
*NL*
and
divined
things
,
histories
within
histories
:
the
image
of
a
quiet
,
*NL*
clever
,
sensitive
,
distinguished
man
,
strolling
on
a
moss-grown
terrace
*NL*
above
the
sweet
Val
d'Arno
and
holding
by
the
hand
a
little
girl
whose
*NL*
bell-like
clearness
gave
a
new
grace
to
childhood
.
The
picture
had
no
*NL*
flourishes
,
but
she
liked
its
lowness
of
tone
and
the
atmosphere
of
*NL*
summer
twilight
that
pervaded
it
.
It
spoke
of
the
kind
of
personal
issue
*NL*
that
touched
her
most
nearly
;
of
the
choice
between
objects
,
subjects
,
*NL*
contacts
--
what
might
she
call
them
?
--
of
a
thin
and
those
of
a
rich
*NL*
association
;
of
a
lonely
,
studious
life
in
a
lovely
land
;
of
an
old
*NL*
sorrow
that
sometimes
ached
to-day
;
of
a
feeling
of
pride
that
was
*NL*
perhaps
exaggerated
,
but
that
had
an
element
of
nobleness
;
of
a
care
*NL*
for
beauty
and
perfection
so
natural
and
so
cultivated
together
that
the
*NL*
career
appeared
to
stretch
beneath
it
in
the
disposed
vistas
and
with
*NL*
the
ranges
of
steps
and
terraces
and
fountains
of
a
formal
Italian
*NL*
garden
--
allowing
only
for
arid
places
freshened
by
the
natural
dews
of
*NL*
a
quaint
half-anxious
,
half-helpless
fatherhood
.
At
Palazzo
Crescentini
*NL*
Mr.
Osmond
's
manner
remained
the
same
;
diffident
at
first
--
oh
*NL*
self-conscious
beyond
doubt
!
and
full
of
the
effort
-LRB-
visible
only
to
a
*NL*
sympathetic
eye
-RRB-
to
overcome
this
disadvantage
;
an
effort
which
*NL*
usually
resulted
in
a
great
deal
of
easy
,
lively
,
very
positive
,
rather
*NL*
aggressive
,
always
suggestive
talk
.
Mr.
Osmond
's
talk
was
not
injured
by
*NL*
the
indication
of
an
eagerness
to
shine
;
Isabel
found
no
difficulty
*NL*
in
believing
that
a
person
was
sincere
who
had
so
many
of
the
signs
of
*NL*
strong
conviction
--
as
for
instance
an
explicit
and
graceful
appreciation
*NL*
of
anything
that
might
be
said
on
his
own
side
of
the
question
,
said
*NL*
perhaps
by
Miss
Archer
in
especial
.
What
continued
to
please
this
young
*NL*
woman
was
that
while
he
talked
so
for
amusement
he
did
n't
talk
,
as
she
*NL*
had
heard
people
,
for
``
effect
.
''
He
uttered
his
ideas
as
if
,
odd
as
*NL*
they
often
appeared
,
he
were
used
to
them
and
had
lived
with
them
;
old
*NL*
polished
knobs
and
heads
and
handles
,
of
precious
substance
,
that
could
*NL*
be
fitted
if
necessary
to
new
walking-sticks
--
not
switches
plucked
in
*NL*
destitution
from
the
common
tree
and
then
too
elegantly
waved
about
.
One
*NL*
day
he
brought
his
small
daughter
with
him
,
and
she
rejoiced
to
renew
*NL*
acquaintance
with
the
child
,
who
,
as
she
presented
her
forehead
to
be
*NL*
kissed
by
every
member
of
the
circle
,
reminded
her
vividly
of
an
ingenue
*NL*
in
a
French
play
.
Isabel
had
never
seen
a
little
person
of
this
pattern
;
*NL*
American
girls
were
very
different
--
different
too
were
the
maidens
of
*NL*
England
.
Pansy
was
so
formed
and
finished
for
her
tiny
place
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
yet
in
imagination
,
as
one
could
see
,
so
innocent
and
*NL*
infantine
.
She
sat
on
the
sofa
by
Isabel
;
she
wore
a
small
grenadine
*NL*
mantle
and
a
pair
of
the
useful
gloves
that
Madame
Merle
had
given
*NL*
her
--
little
grey
gloves
with
a
single
button
.
She
was
like
a
sheet
of
*NL*
blank
paper
--
the
ideal
jeune
fille
of
foreign
fiction
.
Isabel
hoped
that
*NL*
so
fair
and
smooth
a
page
would
be
covered
with
an
edifying
text
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
Gemini
also
came
to
call
upon
her
,
but
the
Countess
was
*NL*
quite
another
affair
.
She
was
by
no
means
a
blank
sheet
;
she
had
been
*NL*
written
over
in
a
variety
of
hands
,
and
Mrs.
Touchett
,
who
felt
by
no
*NL*
means
honoured
by
her
visit
,
pronounced
that
a
number
of
unmistakeable
*NL*
blots
were
to
be
seen
upon
her
surface
.
The
Countess
gave
rise
indeed
to
*NL*
some
discussion
between
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
the
visitor
from
*NL*
Rome
,
in
which
Madame
Merle
-LRB-
who
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
irritate
*NL*
people
by
always
agreeing
with
them
-RRB-
availed
herself
felicitously
enough
*NL*
of
that
large
licence
of
dissent
which
her
hostess
permitted
as
freely
*NL*
as
she
practised
it
.
Mrs.
Touchett
had
declared
it
a
piece
of
audacity
*NL*
that
this
highly
compromised
character
should
have
presented
herself
at
*NL*
such
a
time
of
day
at
the
door
of
a
house
in
which
she
was
esteemed
so
*NL*
little
as
she
must
long
have
known
herself
to
be
at
Palazzo
Crescentini
.
*NL*
Isabel
had
been
made
acquainted
with
the
estimate
prevailing
under
that
*NL*
roof
:
it
represented
Mr.
Osmond
's
sister
as
a
lady
who
had
so
mismanaged
*NL*
her
improprieties
that
they
had
ceased
to
hang
together
at
all
--
which
*NL*
was
at
the
least
what
one
asked
of
such
matters
--
and
had
become
the
mere
*NL*
floating
fragments
of
a
wrecked
renown
,
incommoding
social
circulation
.
*NL*
She
had
been
married
by
her
mother
--
a
more
administrative
person
,
with
*NL*
an
appreciation
of
foreign
titles
which
the
daughter
,
to
do
her
justice
,
*NL*
had
probably
by
this
time
thrown
off
--
to
an
Italian
nobleman
who
had
*NL*
perhaps
given
her
some
excuse
for
attempting
to
quench
the
consciousness
*NL*
of
outrage
.
The
Countess
,
however
,
had
consoled
herself
outrageously
,
*NL*
and
the
list
of
her
excuses
had
now
lost
itself
in
the
labyrinth
of
her
*NL*
adventures
.
Mrs.
Touchett
had
never
consented
to
receive
her
,
though
the
*NL*
Countess
had
made
overtures
of
old
.
Florence
was
not
an
austere
city
;
*NL*
but
,
as
Mrs.
Touchett
said
,
she
had
to
draw
the
line
somewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
defended
the
luckless
lady
with
a
great
deal
of
zeal
and
*NL*
wit
.
She
could
n't
see
why
Mrs.
Touchett
should
make
a
scapegoat
of
a
*NL*
woman
who
had
really
done
no
harm
,
who
had
only
done
good
in
the
wrong
*NL*
way
.
One
must
certainly
draw
the
line
,
but
while
one
was
about
it
one
*NL*
should
draw
it
straight
:
it
was
a
very
crooked
chalk-mark
that
would
*NL*
exclude
the
Countess
Gemini
.
In
that
case
Mrs.
Touchett
had
better
*NL*
shut
up
her
house
;
this
perhaps
would
be
the
best
course
so
long
as
*NL*
she
remained
in
Florence
.
One
must
be
fair
and
not
make
arbitrary
*NL*
differences
:
the
Countess
had
doubtless
been
imprudent
,
she
had
not
been
*NL*
so
clever
as
other
women
.
She
was
a
good
creature
,
not
clever
at
*NL*
all
;
but
since
when
had
that
been
a
ground
of
exclusion
from
the
best
*NL*
society
?
For
ever
so
long
now
one
had
heard
nothing
about
her
,
and
there
*NL*
could
be
no
better
proof
of
her
having
renounced
the
error
of
her
ways
*NL*
than
her
desire
to
become
a
member
of
Mrs.
Touchett
's
circle
.
Isabel
*NL*
could
contribute
nothing
to
this
interesting
dispute
,
not
even
a
patient
*NL*
attention
;
she
contented
herself
with
having
given
a
friendly
welcome
to
*NL*
the
unfortunate
lady
,
who
,
whatever
her
defects
,
had
at
least
the
merit
*NL*
of
being
Mr.
Osmond
's
sister
.
As
she
liked
the
brother
Isabel
thought
it
*NL*
proper
to
try
and
like
the
sister
:
in
spite
of
the
growing
complexity
of
*NL*
things
she
was
still
capable
of
these
primitive
sequences
.
She
had
not
*NL*
received
the
happiest
impression
of
the
Countess
on
meeting
her
at
the
*NL*
villa
,
but
was
thankful
for
an
opportunity
to
repair
the
accident
.
*NL*
Had
not
Mr.
Osmond
remarked
that
she
was
a
respectable
person
?
To
have
*NL*
proceeded
from
Gilbert
Osmond
this
was
a
crude
proposition
,
but
Madame
*NL*
Merle
bestowed
upon
it
a
certain
improving
polish
.
She
told
Isabel
*NL*
more
about
the
poor
Countess
than
Mr.
Osmond
had
done
,
and
related
the
*NL*
history
of
her
marriage
and
its
consequences
.
The
Count
was
a
member
of
*NL*
an
ancient
Tuscan
family
,
but
of
such
small
estate
that
he
had
been
glad
*NL*
to
accept
Amy
Osmond
,
in
spite
of
the
questionable
beauty
which
had
yet
*NL*
not
hampered
her
career
,
with
the
modest
dowry
her
mother
was
able
*NL*
to
offer
--
a
sum
about
equivalent
to
that
which
had
already
formed
her
*NL*
brother
's
share
of
their
patrimony
.
Count
Gemini
since
then
,
however
,
*NL*
had
inherited
money
,
and
now
they
were
well
enough
off
,
as
Italians
*NL*
went
,
though
Amy
was
horribly
extravagant
.
The
Count
was
a
low-lived
*NL*
brute
;
he
had
given
his
wife
every
pretext
.
She
had
no
children
;
she
had
*NL*
lost
three
within
a
year
of
their
birth
.
Her
mother
,
who
had
bristled
*NL*
with
pretensions
to
elegant
learning
and
published
descriptive
poems
and
*NL*
corresponded
on
Italian
subjects
with
the
English
weekly
journals
,
her
*NL*
mother
had
died
three
years
after
the
Countess
's
marriage
,
the
father
,
*NL*
lost
in
the
grey
American
dawn
of
the
situation
,
but
reputed
originally
*NL*
rich
and
wild
,
having
died
much
earlier
.
One
could
see
this
in
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
,
Madame
Merle
held
--
see
that
he
had
been
brought
up
by
a
woman
;
*NL*
though
,
to
do
him
justice
,
one
would
suppose
it
had
been
by
a
more
*NL*
sensible
woman
than
the
American
Corinne
,
as
Mrs.
Osmond
had
liked
to
be
*NL*
called
.
She
had
brought
her
children
to
Italy
after
her
husband
's
death
,
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Touchett
remembered
her
during
the
year
that
followed
her
*NL*
arrival
.
She
thought
her
a
horrible
snob
;
but
this
was
an
irregularity
*NL*
of
judgement
on
Mrs.
Touchett
's
part
,
for
she
,
like
Mrs.
Osmond
,
*NL*
approved
of
political
marriages
.
The
Countess
was
very
good
company
and
*NL*
not
really
the
featherhead
she
seemed
;
all
one
had
to
do
with
her
was
*NL*
to
observe
the
simple
condition
of
not
believing
a
word
she
said
.
*NL*
Madame
Merle
had
always
made
the
best
of
her
for
her
brother
's
sake
;
*NL*
he
appreciated
any
kindness
shown
to
Amy
,
because
-LRB-
if
it
had
to
be
*NL*
confessed
for
him
-RRB-
he
rather
felt
she
let
down
their
common
name
.
*NL*
Naturally
he
could
n't
like
her
style
,
her
shrillness
,
her
egotism
,
*NL*
her
violations
of
taste
and
above
all
of
truth
:
she
acted
badly
on
his
*NL*
nerves
,
she
was
not
HIS
sort
of
woman
.
What
was
his
sort
of
woman
?
Oh
,
*NL*
the
very
opposite
of
the
Countess
,
a
woman
to
whom
the
truth
should
be
*NL*
habitually
sacred
.
Isabel
was
unable
to
estimate
the
number
of
times
her
*NL*
visitor
had
,
in
half
an
hour
,
profaned
it
:
the
Countess
indeed
had
*NL*
given
her
an
impression
of
rather
silly
sincerity
.
She
had
talked
almost
*NL*
exclusively
about
herself
;
how
much
she
should
like
to
know
Miss
Archer
;
*NL*
how
thankful
she
should
be
for
a
real
friend
;
how
base
the
people
in
*NL*
Florence
were
;
how
tired
she
was
of
the
place
;
how
much
she
should
*NL*
like
to
live
somewhere
else
--
in
Paris
,
in
London
,
in
Washington
;
how
*NL*
impossible
it
was
to
get
anything
nice
to
wear
in
Italy
except
a
little
*NL*
old
lace
;
how
dear
the
world
was
growing
everywhere
;
what
a
life
of
*NL*
suffering
and
privation
she
had
led
.
Madame
Merle
listened
with
interest
*NL*
to
Isabel
's
account
of
this
passage
,
but
she
had
not
needed
it
to
feel
*NL*
exempt
from
anxiety
.
On
the
whole
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
Countess
,
*NL*
and
she
could
afford
to
do
what
was
altogether
best
--
not
to
appear
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
had
meanwhile
another
visitor
,
whom
it
was
not
,
even
behind
her
*NL*
back
,
so
easy
a
matter
to
patronise
.
Henrietta
Stackpole
,
who
had
left
*NL*
Paris
after
Mrs.
Touchett
's
departure
for
San
Remo
and
had
worked
her
*NL*
way
down
,
as
she
said
,
through
the
cities
of
North
Italy
,
reached
the
*NL*
banks
of
the
Arno
about
the
middle
of
May
.
Madame
Merle
surveyed
her
*NL*
with
a
single
glance
,
took
her
in
from
head
to
foot
,
and
after
a
pang
*NL*
of
despair
determined
to
endure
her
.
She
determined
indeed
to
delight
*NL*
in
her
.
She
might
n't
be
inhaled
as
a
rose
,
but
she
might
be
grasped
as
*NL*
a
nettle
.
Madame
Merle
genially
squeezed
her
into
insignificance
,
and
*NL*
Isabel
felt
that
in
foreseeing
this
liberality
she
had
done
justice
to
*NL*
her
friend
's
intelligence
.
Henrietta
's
arrival
had
been
announced
by
*NL*
Mr.
Bantling
,
who
,
coming
down
from
Nice
while
she
was
at
Venice
,
and
*NL*
expecting
to
find
her
in
Florence
,
which
she
had
not
yet
reached
,
called
*NL*
at
Palazzo
Crescentini
to
express
his
disappointment
.
Henrietta
's
own
*NL*
advent
occurred
two
days
later
and
produced
in
Mr.
Bantling
an
emotion
*NL*
amply
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
he
had
not
seen
her
since
the
*NL*
termination
of
the
episode
at
Versailles
.
The
humorous
view
of
his
*NL*
situation
was
generally
taken
,
but
it
was
uttered
only
by
Ralph
*NL*
Touchett
,
who
,
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
apartment
,
when
Bantling
smoked
*NL*
a
cigar
there
,
indulged
in
goodness
knew
what
strong
comedy
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
the
all-judging
one
and
her
British
backer
.
This
gentleman
*NL*
took
the
joke
in
perfectly
good
part
and
candidly
confessed
that
he
*NL*
regarded
the
affair
as
a
positive
intellectual
adventure
.
He
liked
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
extremely
;
he
thought
she
had
a
wonderful
head
on
her
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
found
great
comfort
in
the
society
of
a
woman
who
was
not
*NL*
perpetually
thinking
about
what
would
be
said
and
how
what
she
did
,
how
*NL*
what
they
did
--
and
they
had
done
things
!
--
would
look
.
Miss
Stackpole
*NL*
never
cared
how
anything
looked
,
and
,
if
she
did
n't
care
,
pray
why
*NL*
should
he
?
But
his
curiosity
had
been
roused
;
he
wanted
awfully
to
see
*NL*
if
she
ever
WOULD
care
.
He
was
prepared
to
go
as
far
as
she
--
he
did
n't
*NL*
see
why
he
should
break
down
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
showed
no
signs
of
breaking
down
.
Her
prospects
had
brightened
*NL*
on
her
leaving
England
,
and
she
was
now
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
her
*NL*
copious
resources
.
She
had
indeed
been
obliged
to
sacrifice
her
hopes
*NL*
with
regard
to
the
inner
life
;
the
social
question
,
on
the
Continent
,
*NL*
bristled
with
difficulties
even
more
numerous
than
those
she
had
*NL*
encountered
in
England
.
But
on
the
Continent
there
was
the
outer
*NL*
life
,
which
was
palpable
and
visible
at
every
turn
,
and
more
easily
*NL*
convertible
to
literary
uses
than
the
customs
of
those
opaque
islanders
.
*NL*
Out
of
doors
in
foreign
lands
,
as
she
ingeniously
remarked
,
one
seemed
*NL*
to
see
the
right
side
of
the
tapestry
;
out
of
doors
in
England
one
*NL*
seemed
to
see
the
wrong
side
,
which
gave
one
no
notion
of
the
figure
.
*NL*
The
admission
costs
her
historian
a
pang
,
but
Henrietta
,
despairing
of
*NL*
more
occult
things
,
was
now
paying
much
attention
to
the
outer
life
.
She
*NL*
had
been
studying
it
for
two
months
at
Venice
,
from
which
city
she
sent
*NL*
to
the
Interviewer
a
conscientious
account
of
the
gondolas
,
the
Piazza
,
*NL*
the
Bridge
of
Sighs
,
the
pigeons
and
the
young
boatman
who
chanted
*NL*
Tasso
.
The
Interviewer
was
perhaps
disappointed
,
but
Henrietta
was
at
*NL*
least
seeing
Europe
.
Her
present
purpose
was
to
get
down
to
Rome
before
*NL*
the
malaria
should
come
on
--
she
apparently
supposed
that
it
began
on
a
*NL*
fixed
day
;
and
with
this
design
she
was
to
spend
at
present
but
few
days
*NL*
in
Florence
.
Mr.
Bantling
was
to
go
with
her
to
Rome
,
and
she
pointed
*NL*
out
to
Isabel
that
as
he
had
been
there
before
,
as
he
was
a
military
man
*NL*
and
as
he
had
had
a
classical
education
--
he
had
been
bred
at
Eton
,
where
*NL*
they
study
nothing
but
Latin
and
Whyte-Melville
,
said
Miss
Stackpole
--
he
*NL*
would
be
a
most
useful
companion
in
the
city
of
the
Caesars
.
At
this
*NL*
juncture
Ralph
had
the
happy
idea
of
proposing
to
Isabel
that
she
also
,
*NL*
under
his
own
escort
,
should
make
a
pilgrimage
to
Rome
.
She
expected
*NL*
to
pass
a
portion
of
the
next
winter
there
--
that
was
very
well
;
but
*NL*
meantime
there
was
no
harm
in
surveying
the
field
.
There
were
ten
days
*NL*
left
of
the
beautiful
month
of
May
--
the
most
precious
month
of
all
*NL*
to
the
true
Rome-lover
.
Isabel
would
become
a
Rome-lover
;
that
was
a
*NL*
foregone
conclusion
.
She
was
provided
with
a
trusty
companion
of
her
*NL*
own
sex
,
whose
society
,
thanks
to
the
fact
of
other
calls
on
this
lady
's
*NL*
attention
,
would
probably
not
be
oppressive
.
Madame
Merle
would
remain
*NL*
with
Mrs.
Touchett
;
she
had
left
Rome
for
the
summer
and
would
n't
*NL*
care
to
return
.
She
professed
herself
delighted
to
be
left
at
peace
*NL*
in
Florence
;
she
had
locked
up
her
apartment
and
sent
her
cook
home
to
*NL*
Palestrina
.
She
urged
Isabel
,
however
,
to
assent
to
Ralph
's
proposal
,
*NL*
and
assured
her
that
a
good
introduction
to
Rome
was
not
a
thing
to
*NL*
be
despised
.
Isabel
in
truth
needed
no
urging
,
and
the
party
of
four
*NL*
arranged
its
little
journey
.
Mrs.
Touchett
,
on
this
occasion
,
had
*NL*
resigned
herself
to
the
absence
of
a
duenna
;
we
have
seen
that
she
*NL*
now
inclined
to
the
belief
that
her
niece
should
stand
alone
.
One
of
*NL*
Isabel
's
preparations
consisted
of
her
seeing
Gilbert
Osmond
before
she
*NL*
started
and
mentioning
her
intention
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
be
in
Rome
with
you
,
''
he
commented
.
``
I
should
like
to
*NL*
see
you
on
that
wonderful
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
scarcely
faltered
.
``
You
might
come
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
have
a
lot
of
people
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
Isabel
admitted
,
``
of
course
I
shall
not
be
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
he
said
nothing
more
.
``
You
'll
like
it
,
''
he
went
on
at
last
.
*NL*
``
They
've
spoiled
it
,
but
you
'll
rave
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ought
I
to
dislike
it
because
,
poor
old
dear
--
the
Niobe
of
Nations
,
you
*NL*
know
--
it
has
been
spoiled
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
think
not
.
It
has
been
spoiled
so
often
,
''
he
smiled
.
``
If
I
were
*NL*
to
go
,
what
should
I
do
with
my
little
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
leave
her
at
the
villa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
I
like
that
--
though
there
's
a
very
good
old
woman
who
*NL*
looks
after
her
.
I
ca
n't
afford
a
governess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
her
with
you
then
,
''
said
Isabel
promptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Osmond
looked
grave
.
``
She
has
been
in
Rome
all
winter
,
at
her
*NL*
convent
;
and
she
's
too
young
to
make
journeys
of
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
like
bringing
her
forward
?
''
Isabel
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
think
young
girls
should
be
kept
out
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
brought
up
on
a
different
system
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
Oh
,
with
you
it
succeeded
,
because
you
--
you
were
exceptional
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
why
,
''
said
Isabel
,
who
,
however
,
was
not
sure
there
was
not
*NL*
some
truth
in
the
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Osmond
did
n't
explain
;
he
simply
went
on
:
``
If
I
thought
it
would
*NL*
make
her
resemble
you
to
join
a
social
group
in
Rome
I
'd
take
her
there
*NL*
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
make
her
resemble
me
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
Keep
her
like
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
send
her
to
my
sister
,
''
Mr.
Osmond
observed
.
He
had
almost
*NL*
the
air
of
asking
advice
;
he
seemed
to
like
to
talk
over
his
domestic
*NL*
matters
with
Miss
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
concurred
;
``
I
think
that
would
n't
do
much
towards
making
her
*NL*
resemble
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
she
had
left
Florence
Gilbert
Osmond
met
Madame
Merle
at
the
*NL*
Countess
Gemini
's
.
There
were
other
people
present
;
the
Countess
's
*NL*
drawing-room
was
usually
well
filled
,
and
the
talk
had
been
general
,
*NL*
but
after
a
while
Osmond
left
his
place
and
came
and
sat
on
an
ottoman
*NL*
half-behind
,
half-beside
Madame
Merle
's
chair
.
``
She
wants
me
to
go
to
*NL*
Rome
with
her
,
''
he
remarked
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
go
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
there
while
she
's
there
.
She
proposed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
mean
that
you
proposed
it
and
she
assented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
gave
her
a
chance
.
But
she
's
encouraging
--
she
's
very
*NL*
encouraging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rejoice
to
hear
it
--
but
do
n't
cry
victory
too
soon
.
Of
course
you
'll
*NL*
go
to
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Osmond
,
``
it
makes
one
work
,
this
idea
of
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
pretend
you
do
n't
enjoy
it
--
you
're
very
ungrateful
.
You
've
not
*NL*
been
so
well
occupied
these
many
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
way
you
take
it
's
beautiful
,
''
said
Osmond
.
``
I
ought
to
be
grateful
*NL*
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
too
much
so
,
however
,
''
Madame
Merle
answered
.
She
talked
with
*NL*
her
usual
smile
,
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
looking
round
the
room
.
*NL*
``
You
've
made
a
very
good
impression
,
and
I
've
seen
for
myself
that
*NL*
you
've
received
one
.
You
've
not
come
to
Mrs.
Touchett
's
seven
times
to
*NL*
oblige
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
girl
's
not
disagreeable
,
''
Osmond
quietly
conceded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
dropped
her
eye
on
him
a
moment
,
during
which
her
lips
*NL*
closed
with
a
certain
firmness
.
``
Is
that
all
you
can
find
to
say
about
*NL*
that
fine
creature
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
?
Is
n't
it
enough
?
Of
how
many
people
have
you
heard
me
say
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
answer
to
this
,
but
still
presented
her
talkative
grace
to
*NL*
the
room
.
``
You
're
unfathomable
,
''
she
murmured
at
last
.
``
I
'm
frightened
*NL*
at
the
abyss
into
which
I
shall
have
cast
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
almost
gaily
.
``
You
ca
n't
draw
back
--
you
've
gone
too
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
;
but
you
must
do
the
rest
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
do
it
,
''
said
Gilbert
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
remained
silent
and
he
changed
his
place
again
;
but
when
*NL*
she
rose
to
go
he
also
took
leave
.
Mrs.
Touchett
's
victoria
was
awaiting
*NL*
her
guest
in
the
court
,
and
after
he
had
helped
his
friend
into
it
he
*NL*
stood
there
detaining
her
.
``
You
're
very
indiscreet
,
''
she
said
rather
*NL*
wearily
;
``
you
should
n't
have
moved
when
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
taken
off
his
hat
;
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
.
``
I
*NL*
always
forget
;
I
'm
out
of
the
habit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
quite
unfathomable
,
''
she
repeated
,
glancing
up
at
the
windows
of
*NL*
the
house
,
a
modern
structure
in
the
new
part
of
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paid
no
heed
to
this
remark
,
but
spoke
in
his
own
sense
.
``
She
's
*NL*
really
very
charming
.
I
've
scarcely
known
any
one
more
graceful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
me
good
to
hear
you
say
that
.
The
better
you
like
her
the
*NL*
better
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
her
very
much
.
She
's
all
you
described
her
,
and
into
the
bargain
*NL*
capable
,
I
feel
,
of
great
devotion
.
She
has
only
one
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
many
ideas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
warned
you
she
was
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortunately
they
're
very
bad
ones
,
''
said
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
that
fortunate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dame
,
if
they
must
be
sacrificed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
leaned
back
,
looking
straight
before
her
;
then
she
spoke
to
*NL*
the
coachman
.
But
her
friend
again
detained
her
.
``
If
I
go
to
Rome
what
*NL*
shall
I
do
with
Pansy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
and
see
her
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
I
may
not
attempt
to
report
in
its
fulness
our
young
woman
's
response
*NL*
to
the
deep
appeal
of
Rome
,
to
analyse
her
feelings
as
she
trod
the
*NL*
pavement
of
the
Forum
or
to
number
her
pulsations
as
she
crossed
the
*NL*
threshold
of
Saint
Peter
's
.
It
is
enough
to
say
that
her
impression
was
*NL*
such
as
might
have
been
expected
of
a
person
of
her
freshness
and
her
*NL*
eagerness
.
She
had
always
been
fond
of
history
,
and
here
was
history
*NL*
in
the
stones
of
the
street
and
the
atoms
of
the
sunshine
.
She
had
an
*NL*
imagination
that
kindled
at
the
mention
of
great
deeds
,
and
wherever
she
*NL*
turned
some
great
deed
had
been
acted
.
These
things
strongly
moved
her
,
*NL*
but
moved
her
all
inwardly
.
It
seemed
to
her
companions
that
she
talked
*NL*
less
than
usual
,
and
Ralph
Touchett
,
when
he
appeared
to
be
looking
*NL*
listlessly
and
awkwardly
over
her
head
,
was
really
dropping
on
her
an
*NL*
intensity
of
observation
.
By
her
own
measure
she
was
very
happy
;
she
*NL*
would
even
have
been
willing
to
take
these
hours
for
the
happiest
she
*NL*
was
ever
to
know
.
The
sense
of
the
terrible
human
past
was
heavy
to
her
,
*NL*
but
that
of
something
altogether
contemporary
would
suddenly
give
it
*NL*
wings
that
it
could
wave
in
the
blue
.
Her
consciousness
was
so
mixed
*NL*
that
she
scarcely
knew
where
the
different
parts
of
it
would
lead
her
,
*NL*
and
she
went
about
in
a
repressed
ecstasy
of
contemplation
,
seeing
often
*NL*
in
the
things
she
looked
at
a
great
deal
more
than
was
there
,
and
yet
*NL*
not
seeing
many
of
the
items
enumerated
in
her
Murray
.
Rome
,
as
Ralph
*NL*
said
,
confessed
to
the
psychological
moment
.
The
herd
of
reechoing
*NL*
tourists
had
departed
and
most
of
the
solemn
places
had
relapsed
into
*NL*
solemnity
.
The
sky
was
a
blaze
of
blue
,
and
the
plash
of
the
fountains
*NL*
in
their
mossy
niches
had
lost
its
chill
and
doubled
its
music
.
On
the
*NL*
corners
of
the
warm
,
bright
streets
one
stumbled
on
bundles
of
flowers
.
*NL*
Our
friends
had
gone
one
afternoon
--
it
was
the
third
of
their
stay
--
to
*NL*
look
at
the
latest
excavations
in
the
Forum
,
these
labours
having
been
*NL*
for
some
time
previous
largely
extended
.
They
had
descended
from
the
*NL*
modern
street
to
the
level
of
the
Sacred
Way
,
along
which
they
wandered
*NL*
with
a
reverence
of
step
which
was
not
the
same
on
the
part
of
each
.
*NL*
Henrietta
Stackpole
was
struck
with
the
fact
that
ancient
Rome
had
been
*NL*
paved
a
good
deal
like
New
York
,
and
even
found
an
analogy
between
the
*NL*
deep
chariot-ruts
traceable
in
the
antique
street
and
the
overjangled
*NL*
iron
grooves
which
express
the
intensity
of
American
life
.
The
sun
had
*NL*
begun
to
sink
,
the
air
was
a
golden
haze
,
and
the
long
shadows
of
broken
*NL*
column
and
vague
pedestal
leaned
across
the
field
of
ruin
.
Henrietta
*NL*
wandered
away
with
Mr.
Bantling
,
whom
it
was
apparently
delightful
to
*NL*
her
to
hear
speak
of
Julius
Caesar
as
a
``
cheeky
old
boy
,
''
and
Ralph
*NL*
addressed
such
elucidations
as
he
was
prepared
to
offer
to
the
attentive
*NL*
ear
of
our
heroine
.
One
of
the
humble
archeologists
who
hover
about
*NL*
the
place
had
put
himself
at
the
disposal
of
the
two
,
and
repeated
his
*NL*
lesson
with
a
fluency
which
the
decline
of
the
season
had
done
nothing
*NL*
to
impair
.
A
process
of
digging
was
on
view
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
*NL*
Forum
,
and
he
presently
remarked
that
if
it
should
please
the
signori
*NL*
to
go
and
watch
it
a
little
they
might
see
something
of
interest
.
The
*NL*
proposal
commended
itself
more
to
Ralph
than
to
Isabel
,
weary
with
much
*NL*
wandering
;
so
that
she
admonished
her
companion
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
*NL*
while
she
patiently
awaited
his
return
.
The
hour
and
the
place
were
much
*NL*
to
her
taste
--
she
should
enjoy
being
briefly
alone
.
Ralph
accordingly
*NL*
went
off
with
the
cicerone
while
Isabel
sat
down
on
a
prostrate
column
*NL*
near
the
foundations
of
the
Capitol
.
She
wanted
a
short
solitude
,
but
*NL*
she
was
not
long
to
enjoy
it
.
Keen
as
was
her
interest
in
the
rugged
*NL*
relics
of
the
Roman
past
that
lay
scattered
about
her
and
in
which
the
*NL*
corrosion
of
centuries
had
still
left
so
much
of
individual
life
,
her
*NL*
thoughts
,
after
resting
a
while
on
these
things
,
had
wandered
,
by
a
*NL*
concatenation
of
stages
it
might
require
some
subtlety
to
trace
,
to
*NL*
regions
and
objects
charged
with
a
more
active
appeal
.
From
the
Roman
*NL*
past
to
Isabel
Archer
's
future
was
a
long
stride
,
but
her
imagination
*NL*
had
taken
it
in
a
single
flight
and
now
hovered
in
slow
circles
over
*NL*
the
nearer
and
richer
field
.
She
was
so
absorbed
in
her
thoughts
,
as
she
*NL*
bent
her
eyes
upon
a
row
of
cracked
but
not
dislocated
slabs
covering
*NL*
the
ground
at
her
feet
,
that
she
had
not
heard
the
sound
of
approaching
*NL*
footsteps
before
a
shadow
was
thrown
across
the
line
of
her
vision
.
She
*NL*
looked
up
and
saw
a
gentleman
--
a
gentleman
who
was
not
Ralph
come
back
*NL*
to
say
that
the
excavations
were
a
bore
.
This
personage
was
startled
as
*NL*
she
was
startled
;
he
stood
there
baring
his
head
to
her
perceptibly
pale
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
Warburton
!
''
Isabel
exclaimed
as
she
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
no
idea
it
was
you
.
I
turned
that
corner
and
came
upon
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
about
her
to
explain
.
``
I
'm
alone
,
but
my
companions
have
just
*NL*
left
me
.
My
cousin
's
gone
to
look
at
the
work
over
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
;
I
see
.
''
And
Lord
Warburton
's
eyes
wandered
vaguely
in
the
*NL*
direction
she
had
indicated
.
He
stood
firmly
before
her
now
;
he
had
*NL*
recovered
his
balance
and
seemed
to
wish
to
show
it
,
though
very
kindly
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
me
disturb
you
,
''
he
went
on
,
looking
at
her
dejected
pillar
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
you
're
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
rather
tired
.
''
She
hesitated
a
moment
,
but
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
me
interrupt
you
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
I
'm
quite
alone
,
I
've
nothing
on
earth
to
do
.
I
had
no
*NL*
idea
you
were
in
Rome
.
I
've
just
come
from
the
East
.
I
'm
only
passing
*NL*
through
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
making
a
long
journey
,
''
said
Isabel
,
who
had
learned
from
*NL*
Ralph
that
Lord
Warburton
was
absent
from
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
came
abroad
for
six
months
--
soon
after
I
saw
you
last
.
I
've
been
*NL*
in
Turkey
and
Asia
Minor
;
I
came
the
other
day
from
Athens
.
''
He
managed
*NL*
not
to
be
awkward
,
but
he
was
n't
easy
,
and
after
a
longer
look
at
the
*NL*
girl
he
came
down
to
nature
.
``
Do
you
wish
me
to
leave
you
,
or
will
you
*NL*
let
me
stay
a
little
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
it
all
humanely
.
``
I
do
n't
wish
you
to
leave
me
,
Lord
Warburton
;
*NL*
I
'm
very
glad
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
for
saying
that
.
May
I
sit
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fluted
shaft
on
which
she
had
taken
her
seat
would
have
afforded
a
*NL*
resting-place
to
several
persons
,
and
there
was
plenty
of
room
even
for
*NL*
a
highly-developed
Englishman
.
This
fine
specimen
of
that
great
class
*NL*
seated
himself
near
our
young
lady
,
and
in
the
course
of
five
minutes
he
*NL*
had
asked
her
several
questions
,
taken
rather
at
random
and
to
which
,
as
*NL*
he
put
some
of
them
twice
over
,
he
apparently
somewhat
missed
catching
*NL*
the
answer
;
had
given
her
too
some
information
about
himself
which
was
*NL*
not
wasted
upon
her
calmer
feminine
sense
.
He
repeated
more
than
once
*NL*
that
he
had
not
expected
to
meet
her
,
and
it
was
evident
that
the
*NL*
encounter
touched
him
in
a
way
that
would
have
made
preparation
*NL*
advisable
.
He
began
abruptly
to
pass
from
the
impunity
of
things
*NL*
to
their
solemnity
,
and
from
their
being
delightful
to
their
being
*NL*
impossible
.
He
was
splendidly
sunburnt
;
even
his
multitudinous
beard
had
*NL*
been
burnished
by
the
fire
of
Asia
.
He
was
dressed
in
the
loose-fitting
,
*NL*
heterogeneous
garments
in
which
the
English
traveller
in
foreign
lands
*NL*
is
wont
to
consult
his
comfort
and
affirm
his
nationality
;
and
with
*NL*
his
pleasant
steady
eyes
,
his
bronzed
complexion
,
fresh
beneath
its
*NL*
seasoning
,
his
manly
figure
,
his
minimising
manner
and
his
general
air
*NL*
of
being
a
gentleman
and
an
explorer
,
he
was
such
a
representative
of
*NL*
the
British
race
as
need
not
in
any
clime
have
been
disavowed
by
those
*NL*
who
have
a
kindness
for
it
.
Isabel
noted
these
things
and
was
glad
she
*NL*
had
always
liked
him
.
He
had
kept
,
evidently
in
spite
of
shocks
,
every
*NL*
one
of
his
merits
--
properties
these
partaking
of
the
essence
of
great
*NL*
decent
houses
,
as
one
might
put
it
;
resembling
their
innermost
fixtures
*NL*
and
ornaments
,
not
subject
to
vulgar
shifting
and
removable
only
by
*NL*
some
whole
break-up
.
They
talked
of
the
matters
naturally
in
order
;
*NL*
her
uncle
's
death
,
Ralph
's
state
of
health
,
the
way
she
had
passed
her
*NL*
winter
,
her
visit
to
Rome
,
her
return
to
Florence
,
her
plans
for
the
*NL*
summer
,
the
hotel
she
was
staying
at
;
and
then
of
Lord
Warburton
's
own
*NL*
adventures
,
movements
,
intentions
,
impressions
and
present
domicile
.
At
*NL*
last
there
was
a
silence
,
and
it
said
so
much
more
than
either
had
said
*NL*
that
it
scarce
needed
his
final
words
.
``
I
've
written
to
you
several
*NL*
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Written
to
me
?
I
've
never
had
your
letters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
sent
them
.
I
burned
them
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
laughed
Isabel
,
``
it
was
better
that
you
should
do
that
than
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
would
n't
care
for
them
,
''
he
went
on
with
a
simplicity
*NL*
that
touched
her
.
``
It
seemed
to
me
that
after
all
I
had
no
right
to
*NL*
trouble
you
with
letters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
been
very
glad
to
have
news
of
you
.
You
know
how
I
hoped
*NL*
that
--
that
--
''
But
she
stopped
;
there
would
be
such
a
flatness
in
the
*NL*
utterance
of
her
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
you
're
going
to
say
.
You
hoped
we
should
always
remain
good
*NL*
friends
.
''
This
formula
,
as
Lord
Warburton
uttered
it
,
was
certainly
flat
*NL*
enough
;
but
then
he
was
interested
in
making
it
appear
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
herself
reduced
simply
to
``
Please
do
n't
talk
of
all
that
''
;
a
*NL*
speech
which
hardly
struck
her
as
improvement
on
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
small
consolation
to
allow
me
!
''
her
companion
exclaimed
with
*NL*
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
pretend
to
console
you
,
''
said
the
girl
,
who
,
all
still
as
*NL*
she
sat
there
,
threw
herself
back
with
a
sort
of
inward
triumph
on
*NL*
the
answer
that
had
satisfied
him
so
little
six
months
before
.
He
was
*NL*
pleasant
,
he
was
powerful
,
he
was
gallant
;
there
was
no
better
man
than
*NL*
he
.
But
her
answer
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
well
you
do
n't
try
to
console
me
;
it
would
n't
be
in
your
*NL*
power
,
''
she
heard
him
say
through
the
medium
of
her
strange
elation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hoped
we
should
meet
again
,
because
I
had
no
fear
you
would
attempt
*NL*
to
make
me
feel
I
had
wronged
you
.
But
when
you
do
that
--
the
pain
's
*NL*
greater
than
the
pleasure
.
''
And
she
got
up
with
a
small
conscious
*NL*
majesty
,
looking
for
her
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
make
you
feel
that
;
of
course
I
ca
n't
say
that
.
I
only
*NL*
just
want
you
to
know
one
or
two
things
--
in
fairness
to
myself
,
as
it
*NL*
were
.
I
wo
n't
return
to
the
subject
again
.
I
felt
very
strongly
what
I
*NL*
expressed
to
you
last
year
;
I
could
n't
think
of
anything
else
.
I
tried
*NL*
to
forget
--
energetically
,
systematically
.
I
tried
to
take
an
interest
in
*NL*
somebody
else
.
I
tell
you
this
because
I
want
you
to
know
I
did
my
duty
.
*NL*
I
did
n't
succeed
.
It
was
for
the
same
purpose
I
went
abroad
--
as
far
*NL*
away
as
possible
.
They
say
travelling
distracts
the
mind
,
but
it
did
n't
*NL*
distract
mine
.
I
've
thought
of
you
perpetually
,
ever
since
I
last
saw
*NL*
you
.
I
'm
exactly
the
same
.
I
love
you
just
as
much
,
and
everything
I
*NL*
said
to
you
then
is
just
as
true
.
This
instant
at
which
I
speak
to
you
*NL*
shows
me
again
exactly
how
,
to
my
great
misfortune
,
you
just
insuperably
*NL*
charm
me
.
There
--
I
ca
n't
say
less
.
I
do
n't
mean
,
however
,
to
insist
;
*NL*
it
's
only
for
a
moment
.
I
may
add
that
when
I
came
upon
you
a
few
*NL*
minutes
since
,
without
the
smallest
idea
of
seeing
you
,
I
was
,
upon
*NL*
my
honour
,
in
the
very
act
of
wishing
I
knew
where
you
were
.
''
He
had
*NL*
recovered
his
self-control
,
and
while
he
spoke
it
became
complete
.
He
*NL*
might
have
been
addressing
a
small
committee
--
making
all
quietly
and
*NL*
clearly
a
statement
of
importance
;
aided
by
an
occasional
look
at
a
*NL*
paper
of
notes
concealed
in
his
hat
,
which
he
had
not
again
put
on
.
And
*NL*
the
committee
,
assuredly
,
would
have
felt
the
point
proved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
often
thought
of
you
,
Lord
Warburton
,
''
Isabel
answered
.
``
You
may
*NL*
be
sure
I
shall
always
do
that
.
''
And
she
added
in
a
tone
of
which
she
*NL*
tried
to
keep
up
the
kindness
and
keep
down
the
meaning
:
``
There
's
no
*NL*
harm
in
that
on
either
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
along
together
,
and
she
was
prompt
to
ask
about
his
sisters
*NL*
and
request
him
to
let
them
know
she
had
done
so
.
He
made
for
the
moment
*NL*
no
further
reference
to
their
great
question
,
but
dipped
again
into
*NL*
shallower
and
safer
waters
.
But
he
wished
to
know
when
she
was
to
leave
*NL*
Rome
,
and
on
her
mentioning
the
limit
of
her
stay
declared
he
was
glad
*NL*
it
was
still
so
distant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
that
if
you
yourself
are
only
passing
through
?
''
she
*NL*
enquired
with
some
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
when
I
said
I
was
passing
through
I
did
n't
mean
that
one
would
*NL*
treat
Rome
as
if
it
were
Clapham
Junction
.
To
pass
through
Rome
is
to
*NL*
stop
a
week
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
frankly
that
you
mean
to
stay
as
long
as
I
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
flushed
smile
,
for
a
little
,
seemed
to
sound
her
.
``
You
wo
n't
like
*NL*
that
.
You
're
afraid
you
'll
see
too
much
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
matter
what
I
like
.
I
certainly
ca
n't
expect
you
to
leave
*NL*
this
delightful
place
on
my
account
.
But
I
confess
I
'm
afraid
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
I
'll
begin
again
?
I
promise
to
be
very
careful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
gradually
stopped
and
they
stood
a
moment
face
to
face
.
``
Poor
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
!
''
she
said
with
a
compassion
intended
to
be
good
for
both
*NL*
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Lord
Warburton
indeed
!
But
I
'll
be
careful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
unhappy
,
but
you
shall
not
make
ME
so
.
That
I
ca
n't
allow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
believed
I
could
make
you
unhappy
I
think
I
should
try
it
.
''
At
*NL*
this
she
walked
in
advance
and
he
also
proceeded
.
``
I
'll
never
say
a
word
*NL*
to
displease
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
.
If
you
do
,
our
friendship
's
at
an
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
some
day
--
after
a
while
--
you
'll
give
me
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
you
leave
to
make
me
unhappy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hesitated
.
``
To
tell
you
again
--
''
But
he
checked
himself
.
``
I
'll
keep
*NL*
it
down
.
I
'll
keep
it
down
always
.

*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
Touchett
had
been
joined
in
his
visit
to
the
excavation
by
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
and
her
attendant
,
and
these
three
now
emerged
from
among
the
*NL*
mounds
of
earth
and
stone
collected
round
the
aperture
and
came
into
*NL*
sight
of
Isabel
and
her
companion
.
Poor
Ralph
hailed
his
friend
with
joy
*NL*
qualified
by
wonder
,
and
Henrietta
exclaimed
in
a
high
voice
``
Gracious
,
*NL*
there
's
that
lord
!
''
Ralph
and
his
English
neighbour
greeted
with
the
*NL*
austerity
with
which
,
after
long
separations
,
English
neighbours
greet
,
*NL*
and
Miss
Stackpole
rested
her
large
intellectual
gaze
upon
the
sunburnt
*NL*
traveller
.
But
she
soon
established
her
relation
to
the
crisis
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
suppose
you
remember
me
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
do
remember
you
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
.
``
I
asked
you
to
come
*NL*
and
see
me
,
and
you
never
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
go
everywhere
I
'm
asked
,
''
Miss
Stackpole
answered
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well
,
I
wo
n't
ask
you
again
,
''
laughed
the
master
of
Lockleigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
I
'll
go
;
so
be
sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
,
for
all
his
hilarity
,
seemed
sure
enough
.
Mr.
Bantling
*NL*
had
stood
by
without
claiming
a
recognition
,
but
he
now
took
occasion
*NL*
to
nod
to
his
lordship
,
who
answered
him
with
a
friendly
``
Oh
,
you
here
,
*NL*
Bantling
?
''
and
a
hand-shake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Henrietta
,
``
I
did
n't
know
you
knew
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
you
do
n't
know
every
one
I
know
,
''
Mr.
Bantling
rejoined
*NL*
facetiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
that
when
an
Englishman
knew
a
lord
he
always
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
'm
afraid
Bantling
was
ashamed
of
me
,
''
Lord
Warburton
laughed
*NL*
again
.
Isabel
took
pleasure
in
that
note
;
she
gave
a
small
sigh
of
*NL*
relief
as
they
kept
their
course
homeward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
Sunday
;
she
spent
her
morning
over
two
long
*NL*
letters
--
one
to
her
sister
Lily
,
the
other
to
Madame
Merle
;
but
in
*NL*
neither
of
these
epistles
did
she
mention
the
fact
that
a
rejected
*NL*
suitor
had
threatened
her
with
another
appeal
.
Of
a
Sunday
afternoon
*NL*
all
good
Romans
-LRB-
and
the
best
Romans
are
often
the
northern
barbarians
-RRB-
*NL*
follow
the
custom
of
going
to
vespers
at
Saint
Peter
's
;
and
it
had
been
*NL*
agreed
among
our
friends
that
they
would
drive
together
to
the
great
*NL*
church
.
After
lunch
,
an
hour
before
the
carriage
came
,
Lord
Warburton
*NL*
presented
himself
at
the
Hotel
de
Paris
and
paid
a
visit
to
the
two
*NL*
ladies
,
Ralph
Touchett
and
Mr.
Bantling
having
gone
out
together
.
The
*NL*
visitor
seemed
to
have
wished
to
give
Isabel
a
proof
of
his
intention
to
*NL*
keep
the
promise
made
her
the
evening
before
;
he
was
both
discreet
and
*NL*
frank
--
not
even
dumbly
importunate
or
remotely
intense
.
He
thus
left
*NL*
her
to
judge
what
a
mere
good
friend
he
could
be
.
He
talked
about
his
*NL*
travels
,
about
Persia
,
about
Turkey
,
and
when
Miss
Stackpole
asked
him
*NL*
whether
it
would
``
pay
''
for
her
to
visit
those
countries
assured
her
they
*NL*
offered
a
great
field
to
female
enterprise
.
Isabel
did
him
justice
,
but
*NL*
she
wondered
what
his
purpose
was
and
what
he
expected
to
gain
even
by
*NL*
proving
the
superior
strain
of
his
sincerity
.
If
he
expected
to
melt
*NL*
her
by
showing
what
a
good
fellow
he
was
,
he
might
spare
himself
the
*NL*
trouble
.
She
knew
the
superior
strain
of
everything
about
him
,
and
*NL*
nothing
he
could
now
do
was
required
to
light
the
view
.
Moreover
*NL*
his
being
in
Rome
at
all
affected
her
as
a
complication
of
the
wrong
*NL*
sort
--
she
liked
so
complications
of
the
right
.
Nevertheless
,
when
,
on
*NL*
bringing
his
call
to
a
close
,
he
said
he
too
should
be
at
Saint
Peter
's
*NL*
and
should
look
out
for
her
and
her
friends
,
she
was
obliged
to
reply
*NL*
that
he
must
follow
his
convenience
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
church
,
as
she
strolled
over
its
tesselated
acres
,
he
was
the
*NL*
first
person
she
encountered
.
She
had
not
been
one
of
the
superior
*NL*
tourists
who
are
``
disappointed
''
in
Saint
Peter
's
and
find
it
smaller
*NL*
than
its
fame
;
the
first
time
she
passed
beneath
the
huge
leathern
*NL*
curtain
that
strains
and
bangs
at
the
entrance
,
the
first
time
she
found
*NL*
herself
beneath
the
far-arching
dome
and
saw
the
light
drizzle
down
*NL*
through
the
air
thickened
with
incense
and
with
the
reflections
of
*NL*
marble
and
gilt
,
of
mosaic
and
bronze
,
her
conception
of
greatness
rose
*NL*
and
dizzily
rose
.
After
this
it
never
lacked
space
to
soar
.
She
gazed
*NL*
and
wondered
like
a
child
or
a
peasant
,
she
paid
her
silent
tribute
to
*NL*
the
seated
sublime
.
Lord
Warburton
walked
beside
her
and
talked
of
Saint
*NL*
Sophia
of
Constantinople
;
she
feared
for
instance
that
he
would
end
*NL*
by
calling
attention
to
his
exemplary
conduct
.
The
service
had
not
yet
*NL*
begun
,
but
at
Saint
Peter
's
there
is
much
to
observe
,
and
as
there
is
*NL*
something
almost
profane
in
the
vastness
of
the
place
,
which
seems
meant
*NL*
as
much
for
physical
as
for
spiritual
exercise
,
the
different
figures
*NL*
and
groups
,
the
mingled
worshippers
and
spectators
,
may
follow
their
*NL*
various
intentions
without
conflict
or
scandal
.
In
that
splendid
*NL*
immensity
individual
indiscretion
carries
but
a
short
distance
.
Isabel
*NL*
and
her
companions
,
however
,
were
guilty
of
none
;
for
though
Henrietta
*NL*
was
obliged
in
candour
to
declare
that
Michael
Angelo
's
dome
suffered
*NL*
by
comparison
with
that
of
the
Capitol
at
Washington
,
she
addressed
*NL*
her
protest
chiefly
to
Mr.
Bantling
's
ear
and
reserved
it
in
its
more
*NL*
accentuated
form
for
the
columns
of
the
Interviewer
.
Isabel
made
the
*NL*
circuit
of
the
church
with
his
lordship
,
and
as
they
drew
near
the
choir
*NL*
on
the
left
of
the
entrance
the
voices
of
the
Pope
's
singers
were
borne
*NL*
to
them
over
the
heads
of
the
large
number
of
persons
clustered
outside
*NL*
the
doors
.
They
paused
a
while
on
the
skirts
of
this
crowd
,
composed
*NL*
in
equal
measure
of
Roman
cockneys
and
inquisitive
strangers
,
and
while
*NL*
they
stood
there
the
sacred
concert
went
forward
.
Ralph
,
with
Henrietta
*NL*
and
Mr.
Bantling
,
was
apparently
within
,
where
Isabel
,
looking
beyond
*NL*
the
dense
group
in
front
of
her
,
saw
the
afternoon
light
,
silvered
by
*NL*
clouds
of
incense
that
seemed
to
mingle
with
the
splendid
chant
,
slope
*NL*
through
the
embossed
recesses
of
high
windows
.
After
a
while
the
singing
*NL*
stopped
and
then
Lord
Warburton
seemed
disposed
to
move
off
with
her
.
*NL*
Isabel
could
only
accompany
him
;
whereupon
she
found
herself
confronted
*NL*
with
Gilbert
Osmond
,
who
appeared
to
have
been
standing
at
a
short
*NL*
distance
behind
her
.
He
now
approached
with
all
the
forms
--
he
appeared
*NL*
to
have
multiplied
them
on
this
occasion
to
suit
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
decided
to
come
?
''
she
said
as
she
put
out
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
came
last
night
and
called
this
afternoon
at
your
hotel
.
They
*NL*
told
me
you
had
come
here
,
and
I
looked
about
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
others
are
inside
,
''
she
decided
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
come
for
the
others
,
''
he
promptly
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
away
;
Lord
Warburton
was
watching
them
;
perhaps
he
had
heard
*NL*
this
.
Suddenly
she
remembered
it
to
be
just
what
he
had
said
to
her
the
*NL*
morning
he
came
to
Gardencourt
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
.
Mr.
Osmond
's
*NL*
words
had
brought
the
colour
to
her
cheek
,
and
this
reminiscence
had
not
*NL*
the
effect
of
dispelling
it
.
She
repaired
any
betrayal
by
mentioning
to
*NL*
each
companion
the
name
of
the
other
,
and
fortunately
at
this
moment
Mr.
*NL*
Bantling
emerged
from
the
choir
,
cleaving
the
crowd
with
British
valour
*NL*
and
followed
by
Miss
Stackpole
and
Ralph
Touchett
.
I
say
fortunately
,
*NL*
but
this
is
perhaps
a
superficial
view
of
the
matter
;
since
on
*NL*
perceiving
the
gentleman
from
Florence
Ralph
Touchett
appeared
to
take
*NL*
the
case
as
not
committing
him
to
joy
.
He
did
n't
hang
back
,
however
,
*NL*
from
civility
,
and
presently
observed
to
Isabel
,
with
due
benevolence
,
*NL*
that
she
would
soon
have
all
her
friends
about
her
.
Miss
Stackpole
had
*NL*
met
Mr.
Osmond
in
Florence
,
but
she
had
already
found
occasion
to
say
*NL*
to
Isabel
that
she
liked
him
no
better
than
her
other
admirers
--
than
Mr.
*NL*
Touchett
and
Lord
Warburton
,
and
even
than
little
Mr.
Rosier
in
Paris
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
it
's
in
you
,
''
she
had
been
pleased
to
remark
,
``
but
*NL*
for
a
nice
girl
you
do
attract
the
most
unnatural
people
.
Mr.
Goodwood
's
*NL*
the
only
one
I
've
any
respect
for
,
and
he
's
just
the
one
you
do
n't
*NL*
appreciate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
your
opinion
of
Saint
Peter
's
?
''
Mr.
Osmond
was
meanwhile
*NL*
enquiring
of
our
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
large
and
very
bright
,
''
she
contented
herself
with
replying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
large
;
it
makes
one
feel
like
an
atom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
that
the
right
way
to
feel
in
the
greatest
of
human
temples
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
with
rather
a
liking
for
her
phrase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
's
the
right
way
to
feel
everywhere
,
when
one
IS
nobody
.
*NL*
But
I
like
it
in
a
church
as
little
as
anywhere
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
indeed
to
be
a
Pope
!
''
Isabel
exclaimed
,
remembering
something
*NL*
he
had
referred
to
in
Florence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
should
have
enjoyed
that
!
''
said
Gilbert
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
meanwhile
had
joined
Ralph
Touchett
,
and
the
two
strolled
*NL*
away
together
.
``
Who
's
the
fellow
speaking
to
Miss
Archer
?
''
his
lordship
*NL*
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
name
's
Gilbert
Osmond
--
he
lives
in
Florence
,
''
Ralph
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
he
besides
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
at
all
.
Oh
yes
,
he
's
an
American
;
but
one
forgets
that
--
he
's
so
*NL*
little
of
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
known
Miss
Archer
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
or
four
weeks

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
she
like
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
trying
to
find
out

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Find
out

?
''
Ralph
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
she
like
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
will
she
accept
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
after
an
instant
;
``
I
suppose
that
's
what
I
*NL*
horribly
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
if
one
does
nothing
to
prevent
it
,
''
Ralph
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
lordship
stared
a
moment
,
but
apprehended
.
``
Then
we
must
be
*NL*
perfectly
quiet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
quiet
as
the
grave
.
And
only
on
the
chance
!
''
Ralph
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
chance
she
may
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
chance
she
may
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
took
this
at
first
in
silence
,
but
he
spoke
again
.
``
Is
he
*NL*
awfully
clever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Awfully
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
thought
.
``
And
what
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
more
do
you

Ralph
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
took
him
by
the
arm
to
turn
him
:
they
had
to
rejoin
the
others
.
*NL*
``
She
wants
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well

OF
A

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
,
in
the
evening
,
Lord
Warburton
went
again
to
see
his
*NL*
friends
at
their
hotel
,
and
at
this
establishment
he
learned
that
they
*NL*
had
gone
to
the
opera
.
He
drove
to
the
opera
with
the
idea
of
paying
*NL*
them
a
visit
in
their
box
after
the
easy
Italian
fashion
;
and
when
*NL*
he
had
obtained
his
admittance
--
it
was
one
of
the
secondary
*NL*
theatres
--
looked
about
the
large
,
bare
,
ill-lighted
house
.
An
act
*NL*
had
just
terminated
and
he
was
at
liberty
to
pursue
his
quest
.
After
*NL*
scanning
two
or
three
tiers
of
boxes
he
perceived
in
one
of
the
largest
*NL*
of
these
receptacles
a
lady
whom
he
easily
recognised
.
Miss
Archer
was
*NL*
seated
facing
the
stage
and
partly
screened
by
the
curtain
of
the
box
;
*NL*
and
beside
her
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
was
Mr.
Gilbert
Osmond
.
They
*NL*
appeared
to
have
the
place
to
themselves
,
and
Warburton
supposed
their
*NL*
companions
had
taken
advantage
of
the
recess
to
enjoy
the
relative
*NL*
coolness
of
the
lobby
.
He
stood
a
while
with
his
eyes
on
the
interesting
*NL*
pair
;
he
asked
himself
if
he
should
go
up
and
interrupt
the
harmony
.
At
*NL*
last
he
judged
that
Isabel
had
seen
him
,
and
this
accident
determined
*NL*
him
.
There
should
be
no
marked
holding
off
.
He
took
his
way
to
the
upper
*NL*
regions
and
on
the
staircase
met
Ralph
Touchett
slowly
descending
,
his
*NL*
hat
at
the
inclination
of
ennui
and
his
hands
where
they
usually
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
below
a
moment
since
and
was
going
down
to
you
.
I
feel
lonely
*NL*
and
want
company
,
''
was
Ralph
's
greeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
some
that
's
very
good
which
you
've
yet
deserted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
my
cousin
?
Oh
,
she
has
a
visitor
and
does
n't
want
me
.
Then
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
and
Bantling
have
gone
out
to
a
cafe
to
eat
an
ice
--
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
delights
in
an
ice
.
I
did
n't
think
they
wanted
me
either
.
*NL*
The
opera
's
very
bad
;
the
women
look
like
laundresses
and
sing
like
*NL*
peacocks
.
I
feel
very
low
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
go
home
,
''
Lord
Warburton
said
without
affectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
leave
my
young
lady
in
this
sad
place
?
Ah
no
,
I
must
watch
over
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
seems
to
have
plenty
of
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
why
I
must
watch
,
''
said
Ralph
with
the
same
large
*NL*
mock-melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
does
n't
want
you
it
's
probable
she
does
n't
want
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
're
different
.
Go
to
the
box
and
stay
there
while
I
walk
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
went
to
the
box
,
where
Isabel
's
welcome
was
as
to
a
*NL*
friend
so
honourably
old
that
he
vaguely
asked
himself
what
queer
*NL*
temporal
province
she
was
annexing
.
He
exchanged
greetings
with
Mr.
*NL*
Osmond
,
to
whom
he
had
been
introduced
the
day
before
and
who
,
after
he
*NL*
came
in
,
sat
blandly
apart
and
silent
,
as
if
repudiating
competence
in
*NL*
the
subjects
of
allusion
now
probable
.
It
struck
her
second
visitor
*NL*
that
Miss
Archer
had
,
in
operatic
conditions
,
a
radiance
,
even
a
*NL*
slight
exaltation
;
as
she
was
,
however
,
at
all
times
a
keenly-glancing
,
*NL*
quickly-moving
,
completely
animated
young
woman
,
he
may
have
been
*NL*
mistaken
on
this
point
.
Her
talk
with
him
moreover
pointed
to
presence
*NL*
of
mind
;
it
expressed
a
kindness
so
ingenious
and
deliberate
as
to
*NL*
indicate
that
she
was
in
undisturbed
possession
of
her
faculties
.
Poor
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
had
moments
of
bewilderment
.
She
had
discouraged
him
,
*NL*
formally
,
as
much
as
a
woman
could
;
what
business
had
she
then
with
*NL*
such
arts
and
such
felicities
,
above
all
with
such
tones
of
*NL*
reparation
--
preparation
?
Her
voice
had
tricks
of
sweetness
,
but
why
play
*NL*
them
on
HIM
?
The
others
came
back
;
the
bare
,
familiar
,
trivial
opera
*NL*
began
again
.
The
box
was
large
,
and
there
was
room
for
him
to
remain
*NL*
if
he
would
sit
a
little
behind
and
in
the
dark
.
He
did
so
for
half
an
*NL*
hour
,
while
Mr.
Osmond
remained
in
front
,
leaning
forward
,
his
elbows
*NL*
on
his
knees
,
just
behind
Isabel
.
Lord
Warburton
heard
nothing
,
and
from
*NL*
his
gloomy
corner
saw
nothing
but
the
clear
profile
of
this
young
*NL*
lady
defined
against
the
dim
illumination
of
the
house
.
When
there
was
*NL*
another
interval
no
one
moved
.
Mr.
Osmond
talked
to
Isabel
,
and
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
kept
his
corner
.
He
did
so
but
for
a
short
time
,
however
;
*NL*
after
which
he
got
up
and
bade
good-night
to
the
ladies
.
Isabel
said
*NL*
nothing
to
detain
him
,
but
it
did
n't
prevent
his
being
puzzled
again
.
*NL*
Why
should
she
mark
so
one
of
his
values
--
quite
the
wrong
one
--
when
she
*NL*
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
another
,
which
was
quite
the
right
?
He
was
*NL*
angry
with
himself
for
being
puzzled
,
and
then
angry
for
being
angry
.
*NL*
Verdi
's
music
did
little
to
comfort
him
,
and
he
left
the
theatre
and
*NL*
walked
homeward
,
without
knowing
his
way
,
through
the
tortuous
,
tragic
*NL*
streets
of
Rome
,
where
heavier
sorrows
than
his
had
been
carried
under
*NL*
the
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
character
of
that
gentleman
?
''
Osmond
asked
of
Isabel
after
*NL*
he
had
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Irreproachable
--
do
n't
you
see
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
owns
about
half
England
;
that
's
his
character
,
''
Henrietta
remarked
.
*NL*
``
That
's
what
they
call
a
free
country
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
's
a
great
proprietor
?
Happy
man
!
''
said
Gilbert
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
that
happiness
--
the
ownership
of
wretched
human
beings
?
''
*NL*
cried
Miss
Stackpole
.
``
He
owns
his
tenants
and
has
thousands
of
them
.
*NL*
It
's
pleasant
to
own
something
,
but
inanimate
objects
are
enough
for
me
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
insist
on
flesh
and
blood
and
minds
and
consciences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
you
own
a
human
being
or
two
,
''
Mr.
Bantling
suggested
*NL*
jocosely
.
``
I
wonder
if
Warburton
orders
his
tenants
about
as
you
do
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
Warburton
's
a
great
radical
,
''
Isabel
said
.
``
He
has
very
advanced
*NL*
opinions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
very
advanced
stone
walls
.
His
park
's
enclosed
by
a
gigantic
*NL*
iron
fence
,
some
thirty
miles
round
,
''
Henrietta
announced
for
the
*NL*
information
of
Mr.
Osmond
.
``
I
should
like
him
to
converse
with
a
few
of
*NL*
our
Boston
radicals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
they
approve
of
iron
fences
?
''
asked
Mr.
Bantling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
to
shut
up
wicked
conservatives
.
I
always
feel
as
if
I
were
*NL*
talking
to
YOU
over
something
with
a
neat
top-finish
of
broken
glass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
him
well
,
this
unreformed
reformer
?
''
Osmond
went
on
,
*NL*
questioning
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
enough
for
all
the
use
I
have
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
of
a
use
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
like
to
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Liking
to
like
'
--
why
,
it
makes
a
passion
!
''
said
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
''
--
she
considered
--
``
keep
that
for
liking
to
DISlike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
provoke
me
then
,
''
Osmond
laughed
,
``
to
a
passion
for
*NL*
HIM
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
nothing
for
a
moment
,
but
then
met
the
light
question
with
a
*NL*
disproportionate
gravity
.
``
No
,
Mr.
Osmond
;
I
do
n't
think
I
should
ever
*NL*
dare
to
provoke
you
.
Lord
Warburton
,
at
any
rate
,
''
she
more
easily
*NL*
added
,
``
is
a
very
nice
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
great
ability
?
''
her
friend
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
excellent
ability
,
and
as
good
as
he
looks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
good
as
he
's
good-looking
do
you
mean
?
He
's
very
good-looking
.
How
*NL*
detestably
fortunate
!
--
to
be
a
great
English
magnate
,
to
be
clever
and
*NL*
handsome
into
the
bargain
,
and
,
by
way
of
finishing
off
,
to
enjoy
your
*NL*
high
favour
!
That
's
a
man
I
could
envy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
considered
him
with
interest
.
``
You
seem
to
me
to
be
always
*NL*
envying
some
one
.
Yesterday
it
was
the
Pope
;
to-day
it
's
poor
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
envy
's
not
dangerous
;
it
would
n't
hurt
a
mouse

I
do
n't
want

destroy
the
people
--
I
only
want
to
BE
them

You
see
it
would
destroy
*NL*
only
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
like
to
be
the
Pope
?
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
love
it
--
but
I
should
have
gone
in
for
it
earlier
.
But
*NL*
why
''
--
Osmond
reverted
--
``
do
you
speak
of
your
friend
as
poor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Women
--
when
they
are
very
,
very
good
sometimes
pity
men
after
they
've
*NL*
hurt
them
;
that
's
their
great
way
of
showing
kindness
,
''
said
Ralph
,
*NL*
joining
in
the
conversation
for
the
first
time
and
with
a
cynicism
so
*NL*
transparently
ingenious
as
to
be
virtually
innocent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
have
I
hurt
Lord
Warburton
?
''
Isabel
asked
,
raising
her
eyebrows
*NL*
as
if
the
idea
were
perfectly
fresh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
serves
him
right
if
you
have
,
''
said
Henrietta
while
the
curtain
rose
*NL*
for
the
ballet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
saw
no
more
of
her
attributive
victim
for
the
next
twenty-four
*NL*
hours
,
but
on
the
second
day
after
the
visit
to
the
opera
she
*NL*
encountered
him
in
the
gallery
of
the
Capitol
,
where
he
stood
before
the
*NL*
lion
of
the
collection
,
the
statue
of
the
Dying
Gladiator
.
She
had
come
*NL*
in
with
her
companions
,
among
whom
,
on
this
occasion
again
,
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
had
his
place
,
and
the
party
,
having
ascended
the
staircase
,
*NL*
entered
the
first
and
finest
of
the
rooms
.
Lord
Warburton
addressed
her
*NL*
alertly
enough
,
but
said
in
a
moment
that
he
was
leaving
the
gallery
.
*NL*
``
And
I
'm
leaving
Rome
,
''
he
added
.
``
I
must
bid
you
goodbye
.
''
Isabel
,
*NL*
inconsequently
enough
,
was
now
sorry
to
hear
it
.
This
was
perhaps
*NL*
because
she
had
ceased
to
be
afraid
of
his
renewing
his
suit
;
she
was
*NL*
thinking
of
something
else
.
She
was
on
the
point
of
naming
her
regret
,
*NL*
but
she
checked
herself
and
simply
wished
him
a
happy
journey
;
which
*NL*
made
him
look
at
her
rather
unlightedly
.
``
I
'm
afraid
you
'll
think
me
*NL*
very
`
volatile
.
'
I
told
you
the
other
day
I
wanted
so
much
to
stop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
;
you
could
easily
change
your
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bon
voyage
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
rid
of
me
,
''
said
his
lordship
quite
*NL*
dismally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
least
.
But
I
hate
partings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
care
what
I
do
,
''
he
went
on
pitifully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
looked
at
him
a
moment
.
``
Ah
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
're
not
keeping
your
*NL*
promise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
coloured
like
a
boy
of
fifteen
.
``
If
I
'm
not
,
then
it
's
because
I
*NL*
ca
n't
;
and
that
's
why
I
'm
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
.
''
He
lingered
still
,
however
.
``
When
shall
I
see
you
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
hesitated
,
but
soon
,
as
if
she
had
had
a
happy
inspiration
:
``
Some
*NL*
day
after
you
're
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
never
be
.
It
will
be
after
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
as
well
,
''
she
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
quite
as
well
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
shook
hands
,
and
he
left
her
alone
in
the
glorious
room
,
among
the
*NL*
shining
antique
marbles
.
She
sat
down
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
of
*NL*
these
presences
,
regarding
them
vaguely
,
resting
her
eyes
on
their
*NL*
beautiful
blank
faces
;
listening
,
as
it
were
,
to
their
eternal
silence
.
*NL*
It
is
impossible
,
in
Rome
at
least
,
to
look
long
at
a
great
company
of
*NL*
Greek
sculptures
without
feeling
the
effect
of
their
noble
quietude
;
*NL*
which
,
as
with
a
high
door
closed
for
the
ceremony
,
slowly
drops
on
*NL*
the
spirit
the
large
white
mantle
of
peace
.
I
say
in
Rome
especially
,
*NL*
because
the
Roman
air
is
an
exquisite
medium
for
such
impressions
.
The
*NL*
golden
sunshine
mingles
with
them
,
the
deep
stillness
of
the
past
,
so
*NL*
vivid
yet
,
though
it
is
nothing
but
a
void
full
of
names
,
seems
to
throw
*NL*
a
solemn
spell
upon
them
.
The
blinds
were
partly
closed
in
the
windows
*NL*
of
the
Capitol
,
and
a
clear
,
warm
shadow
rested
on
the
figures
and
made
*NL*
them
more
mildly
human
.
Isabel
sat
there
a
long
time
,
under
the
charm
*NL*
of
their
motionless
grace
,
wondering
to
what
,
of
their
experience
,
their
*NL*
absent
eyes
were
open
,
and
how
,
to
our
ears
,
their
alien
lips
would
*NL*
sound
.
The
dark
red
walls
of
the
room
threw
them
into
relief
;
the
*NL*
polished
marble
floor
reflected
their
beauty
.
She
had
seen
them
all
*NL*
before
,
but
her
enjoyment
repeated
itself
,
and
it
was
all
the
greater
*NL*
because
she
was
glad
again
,
for
the
time
,
to
be
alone
.
At
last
,
however
,
*NL*
her
attention
lapsed
,
drawn
off
by
a
deeper
tide
of
life
.
An
occasional
*NL*
tourist
came
in
,
stopped
and
stared
a
moment
at
the
Dying
Gladiator
,
and
*NL*
then
passed
out
of
the
other
door
,
creaking
over
the
smooth
pavement
.
At
*NL*
the
end
of
half
an
hour
Gilbert
Osmond
reappeared
,
apparently
in
advance
*NL*
of
his
companions
.
He
strolled
toward
her
slowly
,
with
his
hands
*NL*
behind
him
and
his
usual
enquiring
,
yet
not
quite
appealing
smile
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
surprised
to
find
you
alone
,
I
thought
you
had
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
have
--
the
best
.
''
And
she
glanced
at
the
Antinous
and
the
Faun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
them
better
company
than
an
English
peer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
English
peer
left
me
some
time
ago
.
''
She
got
up
,
speaking
with
*NL*
intention
a
little
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Osmond
noted
her
dryness
,
which
contributed
for
him
to
the
interest
*NL*
of
his
question
.
``
I
'm
afraid
that
what
I
heard
the
other
evening
is
*NL*
true
:
you
're
rather
cruel
to
that
nobleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
looked
a
moment
at
the
vanquished
Gladiator
.
``
It
's
not
true
.
I
'm
*NL*
scrupulously
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
what
I
mean
!
''
Gilbert
Osmond
returned
,
and
with
such
*NL*
happy
hilarity
that
his
joke
needs
to
be
explained
.
We
know
that
he
was
*NL*
fond
of
originals
,
of
rarities
,
of
the
superior
and
the
exquisite
;
and
*NL*
now
that
he
had
seen
Lord
Warburton
,
whom
he
thought
a
very
fine
example
*NL*
of
his
race
and
order
,
he
perceived
a
new
attraction
in
the
idea
of
*NL*
taking
to
himself
a
young
lady
who
had
qualified
herself
to
figure
in
*NL*
his
collection
of
choice
objects
by
declining
so
noble
a
hand
.
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
had
a
high
appreciation
of
this
particular
patriciate
;
not
so
*NL*
much
for
its
distinction
,
which
he
thought
easily
surpassable
,
as
for
*NL*
its
solid
actuality
.
He
had
never
forgiven
his
star
for
not
appointing
*NL*
him
to
an
English
dukedom
,
and
he
could
measure
the
unexpectedness
of
*NL*
such
conduct
as
Isabel
's
.
It
would
be
proper
that
the
woman
he
might
*NL*
marry
should
have
done
something
of
that
sort
.

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
Touchett
,
in
talk
with
his
excellent
friend
,
had
rather
markedly
*NL*
qualified
,
as
we
know
,
his
recognition
of
Gilbert
Osmond
's
personal
*NL*
merits
;
but
he
might
really
have
felt
himself
illiberal
in
the
light
of
*NL*
that
gentleman
's
conduct
during
the
rest
of
the
visit
to
Rome
.
Osmond
*NL*
spent
a
portion
of
each
day
with
Isabel
and
her
companions
,
and
ended
*NL*
by
affecting
them
as
the
easiest
of
men
to
live
with
.
Who
would
n't
have
*NL*
seen
that
he
could
command
,
as
it
were
,
both
tact
and
gaiety
?
--
which
*NL*
perhaps
was
exactly
why
Ralph
had
made
his
old-time
look
of
superficial
*NL*
sociability
a
reproach
to
him
.
Even
Isabel
's
invidious
kinsman
was
*NL*
obliged
to
admit
that
he
was
just
now
a
delightful
associate
.
His
*NL*
good
humour
was
imperturbable
,
his
knowledge
of
the
right
fact
,
his
*NL*
production
of
the
right
word
,
as
convenient
as
the
friendly
flicker
of
*NL*
a
match
for
your
cigarette
.
Clearly
he
was
amused
--
as
amused
as
a
man
*NL*
could
be
who
was
so
little
ever
surprised
,
and
that
made
him
almost
*NL*
applausive
.
It
was
not
that
his
spirits
were
visibly
high
--
he
would
*NL*
never
,
in
the
concert
of
pleasure
,
touch
the
big
drum
by
so
much
as
a
*NL*
knuckle
:
he
had
a
mortal
dislike
to
the
high
,
ragged
note
,
to
what
*NL*
he
called
random
ravings
.
He
thought
Miss
Archer
sometimes
of
too
*NL*
precipitate
a
readiness
.
It
was
pity
she
had
that
fault
,
because
if
she
*NL*
had
not
had
it
she
would
really
have
had
none
;
she
would
have
been
as
*NL*
smooth
to
his
general
need
of
her
as
handled
ivory
to
the
palm
.
If
he
*NL*
was
not
personally
loud
,
however
,
he
was
deep
,
and
during
these
closing
*NL*
days
of
the
Roman
May
he
knew
a
complacency
that
matched
with
slow
*NL*
irregular
walks
under
the
pines
of
the
Villa
Borghese
,
among
the
*NL*
small
sweet
meadow-flowers
and
the
mossy
marbles
.
He
was
pleased
with
*NL*
everything
;
he
had
never
before
been
pleased
with
so
many
things
at
*NL*
once
.
Old
impressions
,
old
enjoyments
,
renewed
themselves
;
one
evening
,
*NL*
going
home
to
his
room
at
the
inn
,
he
wrote
down
a
little
sonnet
to
*NL*
which
he
prefixed
the
title
of
``
Rome
Revisited
.
''
A
day
or
two
later
he
*NL*
showed
this
piece
of
correct
and
ingenious
verse
to
Isabel
,
explaining
*NL*
to
her
that
it
was
an
Italian
fashion
to
commemorate
the
occasions
of
*NL*
life
by
a
tribute
to
the
muse
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
pleasures
in
general
singly
;
he
was
too
often
--
he
would
have
*NL*
admitted
that
--
too
sorely
aware
of
something
wrong
,
something
ugly
;
the
*NL*
fertilising
dew
of
a
conceivable
felicity
too
seldom
descended
on
his
*NL*
spirit
.
But
at
present
he
was
happy
--
happier
than
he
had
perhaps
ever
*NL*
been
in
his
life
,
and
the
feeling
had
a
large
foundation
.
This
was
*NL*
simply
the
sense
of
success
--
the
most
agreeable
emotion
of
the
human
*NL*
heart
.
Osmond
had
never
had
too
much
of
it
;
in
this
respect
he
had
the
*NL*
irritation
of
satiety
,
as
he
knew
perfectly
well
and
often
reminded
*NL*
himself
.
``
Ah
no
,
I
've
not
been
spoiled
;
certainly
I
've
not
been
*NL*
spoiled
,
''
he
used
inwardly
to
repeat
.
``
If
I
do
succeed
before
I
die
*NL*
I
shall
thoroughly
have
earned
it
.
''
He
was
too
apt
to
reason
as
if
*NL*
``
earning
''
this
boon
consisted
above
all
of
covertly
aching
for
it
and
*NL*
might
be
confined
to
that
exercise
.
Absolutely
void
of
it
,
also
,
his
*NL*
career
had
not
been
;
he
might
indeed
have
suggested
to
a
spectator
here
*NL*
and
there
that
he
was
resting
on
vague
laurels
.
But
his
triumphs
were
,
*NL*
some
of
them
,
now
too
old
;
others
had
been
too
easy
.
The
present
one
had
*NL*
been
less
arduous
than
might
have
been
expected
,
but
had
been
easy
--
that
*NL*
is
had
been
rapid
--
only
because
he
had
made
an
altogether
exceptional
*NL*
effort
,
a
greater
effort
than
he
had
believed
it
in
him
to
make
.
The
*NL*
desire
to
have
something
or
other
to
show
for
his
``
parts
''
--
to
show
*NL*
somehow
or
other
--
had
been
the
dream
of
his
youth
;
but
as
the
years
went
*NL*
on
the
conditions
attached
to
any
marked
proof
of
rarity
had
affected
*NL*
him
more
and
more
as
gross
and
detestable
;
like
the
swallowing
of
mugs
*NL*
of
beer
to
advertise
what
one
could
``
stand
.
''
If
an
anonymous
drawing
on
*NL*
a
museum
wall
had
been
conscious
and
watchful
it
might
have
known
this
*NL*
peculiar
pleasure
of
being
at
last
and
all
of
a
sudden
identified
--
as
*NL*
from
the
hand
of
a
great
master
--
by
the
so
high
and
so
unnoticed
fact
of
*NL*
style
.
His
``
style
''
was
what
the
girl
had
discovered
with
a
little
help
;
*NL*
and
now
,
beside
herself
enjoying
it
,
she
should
publish
it
to
the
world
*NL*
without
his
having
any
of
the
trouble
.
She
should
do
the
thing
FOR
him
,
*NL*
and
he
would
not
have
waited
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
before
the
time
fixed
in
advance
for
her
departure
this
young
*NL*
lady
received
from
Mrs.
Touchett
a
telegram
running
as
follows
:
``
Leave
*NL*
Florence
4th
June
for
Bellaggio
,
and
take
you
if
you
have
not
other
*NL*
views
.
But
ca
n't
wait
if
you
dawdle
in
Rome
.
''
The
dawdling
in
Rome
was
*NL*
very
pleasant
,
but
Isabel
had
different
views
,
and
she
let
her
aunt
know
*NL*
she
would
immediately
join
her
.
She
told
Gilbert
Osmond
that
she
had
*NL*
done
so
,
and
he
replied
that
,
spending
many
of
his
summers
as
well
as
*NL*
his
winters
in
Italy
,
he
himself
would
loiter
a
little
longer
in
the
*NL*
cool
shadow
of
Saint
Peter
's
.
He
would
not
return
to
Florence
for
ten
*NL*
days
more
,
and
in
that
time
she
would
have
started
for
Bellaggio
.
*NL*
It
might
be
months
in
this
case
before
he
should
see
her
again
.
This
*NL*
exchange
took
place
in
the
large
decorated
sitting-room
occupied
by
our
*NL*
friends
at
the
hotel
;
it
was
late
in
the
evening
,
and
Ralph
Touchett
was
*NL*
to
take
his
cousin
back
to
Florence
on
the
morrow
.
Osmond
had
found
the
*NL*
girl
alone
;
Miss
Stackpole
had
contracted
a
friendship
with
a
delightful
*NL*
American
family
on
the
fourth
floor
and
had
mounted
the
interminable
*NL*
staircase
to
pay
them
a
visit
.
Henrietta
contracted
friendships
,
in
*NL*
travelling
,
with
great
freedom
,
and
had
formed
in
railway-carriages
*NL*
several
that
were
among
her
most
valued
ties
.
Ralph
was
making
*NL*
arrangements
for
the
morrow
's
journey
,
and
Isabel
sat
alone
in
a
*NL*
wilderness
of
yellow
upholstery
.
The
chairs
and
sofas
were
orange
;
*NL*
the
walls
and
windows
were
draped
in
purple
and
gilt
.
The
mirrors
,
the
*NL*
pictures
had
great
flamboyant
frames
;
the
ceiling
was
deeply
vaulted
and
*NL*
painted
over
with
naked
muses
and
cherubs
.
For
Osmond
the
place
was
ugly
*NL*
to
distress
;
the
false
colours
,
the
sham
splendour
were
like
vulgar
,
*NL*
bragging
,
lying
talk
.
Isabel
had
taken
in
hand
a
volume
of
Ampere
,
*NL*
presented
,
on
their
arrival
in
Rome
,
by
Ralph
;
but
though
she
held
it
in
*NL*
her
lap
with
her
finger
vaguely
kept
in
the
place
she
was
not
impatient
*NL*
to
pursue
her
study
.
A
lamp
covered
with
a
drooping
veil
of
pink
*NL*
tissue-paper
burned
on
the
table
beside
her
and
diffused
a
strange
pale
*NL*
rosiness
over
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
you
'll
come
back
;
but
who
knows
?
''
Gilbert
Osmond
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
're
much
more
likely
to
start
on
your
voyage
round
the
*NL*
world
.
You
're
under
no
obligation
to
come
back
;
you
can
do
exactly
what
*NL*
you
choose
;
you
can
roam
through
space
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Italy
's
a
part
of
space
,
''
Isabel
answered
.
``
I
can
take
it
on
the
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
way
round
the
world
?
No
,
do
n't
do
that
.
Do
n't
put
us
in
a
*NL*
parenthesis
--
give
us
a
chapter
to
ourselves
.
I
do
n't
want
to
see
you
on
*NL*
your
travels
.
I
'd
rather
see
you
when
they
're
over
.
I
should
like
to
see
*NL*
you
when
you
're
tired
and
satiated
,
''
Osmond
added
in
a
moment
.
``
I
shall
*NL*
prefer
you
in
that
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
,
with
her
eyes
bent
,
fingered
the
pages
of
M.
Ampere
.
``
You
turn
*NL*
things
into
ridicule
without
seeming
to
do
it
,
though
not
,
I
think
,
*NL*
without
intending
it
.
You
've
no
respect
for
my
travels
--
you
think
them
*NL*
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
find
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
in
the
same
tone
,
fretting
the
edge
of
her
book
with
the
*NL*
paper-knife
.
``
You
see
my
ignorance
,
my
blunders
,
the
way
I
wander
about
*NL*
as
if
the
world
belonged
to
me
,
simply
because
--
because
it
has
been
put
*NL*
into
my
power
to
do
so
.
You
do
n't
think
a
woman
ought
to
do
that
.
You
*NL*
think
it
bold
and
ungraceful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
beautiful
,
''
said
Osmond
.
``
You
know
my
opinions
--
I
've
treated
*NL*
you
to
enough
of
them
.
Do
n't
you
remember
my
telling
you
that
one
ought
*NL*
to
make
one
's
life
a
work
of
art
?
You
looked
rather
shocked
at
first
;
*NL*
but
then
I
told
you
that
it
was
exactly
what
you
seemed
to
me
to
be
*NL*
trying
to
do
with
your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
from
her
book
.
``
What
you
despise
most
in
the
world
is
bad
,
*NL*
is
stupid
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
.
But
yours
seem
to
me
very
clear
and
very
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
to
go
to
Japan
next
winter
you
would
laugh
at
me
,
''
she
went
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
gave
a
smile
--
a
keen
one
,
but
not
a
laugh
,
for
the
tone
of
their
*NL*
conversation
was
not
jocose
.
Isabel
had
in
fact
her
solemnity
;
he
had
*NL*
seen
it
before
.
``
You
have
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
what
I
say
.
You
think
such
an
idea
absurd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
give
my
little
finger
to
go
to
Japan
;
it
's
one
of
the
countries
*NL*
I
want
most
to
see
.
Ca
n't
you
believe
that
,
with
my
taste
for
old
*NL*
lacquer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
a
taste
for
old
lacquer
to
excuse
me
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
a
better
excuse
--
the
means
of
going
.
You
're
quite
wrong
in
*NL*
your
theory
that
I
laugh
at
you
.
I
do
n't
know
what
has
put
it
into
your
*NL*
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
n't
be
remarkable
if
you
did
think
it
ridiculous
that
I
should
*NL*
have
the
means
to
travel
when
you
've
not
;
for
you
know
everything
and
I
*NL*
know
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
more
reason
why
you
should
travel
and
learn
,
''
smiled
Osmond
.
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
he
added
as
if
it
were
a
point
to
be
made
,
``
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
not
struck
with
the
oddity
of
his
saying
this
gravely
;
she
*NL*
was
thinking
that
the
pleasantest
incident
of
her
life
--
so
it
pleased
*NL*
her
to
qualify
these
too
few
days
in
Rome
,
which
she
might
musingly
have
*NL*
likened
to
the
figure
of
some
small
princess
of
one
of
the
ages
of
dress
*NL*
overmuffled
in
a
mantle
of
state
and
dragging
a
train
that
it
took
pages
*NL*
or
historians
to
hold
up
--
that
this
felicity
was
coming
to
an
end
.
That
*NL*
most
of
the
interest
of
the
time
had
been
owing
to
Mr.
Osmond
was
a
*NL*
reflexion
she
was
not
just
now
at
pains
to
make
;
she
had
already
done
*NL*
the
point
abundant
justice
.
But
she
said
to
herself
that
if
there
were
*NL*
a
danger
they
should
never
meet
again
,
perhaps
after
all
it
would
be
*NL*
as
well
.
Happy
things
do
n't
repeat
themselves
,
and
her
adventure
wore
*NL*
already
the
changed
,
the
seaward
face
of
some
romantic
island
from
*NL*
which
,
after
feasting
on
purple
grapes
,
she
was
putting
off
while
the
*NL*
breeze
rose
.
She
might
come
back
to
Italy
and
find
him
different
--
this
*NL*
strange
man
who
pleased
her
just
as
he
was
;
and
it
would
be
better
*NL*
not
to
come
than
run
the
risk
of
that
.
But
if
she
was
not
to
come
the
*NL*
greater
the
pity
that
the
chapter
was
closed
;
she
felt
for
a
moment
a
*NL*
pang
that
touched
the
source
of
tears
.
The
sensation
kept
her
*NL*
silent
,
and
Gilbert
Osmond
was
silent
too
;
he
was
looking
at
her
.
``
Go
*NL*
everywhere
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
in
a
low
,
kind
voice
;
``
do
everything
;
get
*NL*
everything
out
of
life
.
Be
happy
,
--
be
triumphant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
being
triumphant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
doing
what
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
triumph
,
then
,
it
seems
to
me
,
is
to
fail
!
Doing
all
the
vain
things
*NL*
one
likes
is
often
very
tiresome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
''
said
Osmond
with
his
quiet
quickness
.
``
As
I
intimated
just
*NL*
now
,
you
'll
be
tired
some
day
.
''
He
paused
a
moment
and
then
he
went
on
:
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
had
better
not
wait
till
then
for
something
I
*NL*
want
to
say
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
ca
n't
advise
you
without
knowing
what
it
is
.
But
I
'm
horrid
when
*NL*
I
'm
tired
,
''
Isabel
added
with
due
inconsequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
that
.
You
're
angry
,
sometimes
--
that
I
can
believe
,
*NL*
though
I
've
never
seen
it
.
But
I
'm
sure
you
're
never
`
cross
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
even
when
I
lose
my
temper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
lose
it
--
you
find
it
,
and
that
must
be
beautiful
.
''
Osmond
*NL*
spoke
with
a
noble
earnestness
.
``
They
must
be
great
moments
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
only
find
it
now
!
''
Isabel
nervously
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
afraid
;
I
should
fold
my
arms
and
admire
you
.
I
'm
speaking
very
*NL*
seriously
.
''
He
leaned
forward
,
a
hand
on
each
knee
;
for
some
moments
he
*NL*
bent
his
eyes
on
the
floor
.
``
What
I
wish
to
say
to
you
,
''
he
went
on
at
*NL*
last
,
looking
up
,
``
is
that
I
find
I
'm
in
love
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
instantly
rose
.
``
Ah
,
keep
that
till
I
am
tired
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tired
of
hearing
it
from
others
?
''
He
sat
there
raising
his
eyes
to
her
.
*NL*
``
No
,
you
may
heed
it
now
or
never
,
as
you
please
.
But
after
all
I
must
*NL*
say
it
now
.
''
She
had
turned
away
,
but
in
the
movement
she
had
stopped
*NL*
herself
and
dropped
her
gaze
upon
him
.
The
two
remained
a
while
in
this
*NL*
situation
,
exchanging
a
long
look
--
the
large
,
conscious
look
of
the
*NL*
critical
hours
of
life
.
Then
he
got
up
and
came
near
her
,
deeply
*NL*
respectful
,
as
if
he
were
afraid
he
had
been
too
familiar
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
absolutely
in
love
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
repeated
the
announcement
in
a
tone
of
almost
impersonal
*NL*
discretion
,
like
a
man
who
expected
very
little
from
it
but
who
spoke
*NL*
for
his
own
needed
relief
.
The
tears
came
into
her
eyes
:
this
time
*NL*
they
obeyed
the
sharpness
of
the
pang
that
suggested
to
her
somehow
*NL*
the
slipping
of
a
fine
bolt
--
backward
,
forward
,
she
could
n't
have
said
*NL*
which
.
The
words
he
had
uttered
made
him
,
as
he
stood
there
,
beautiful
*NL*
and
generous
,
invested
him
as
with
the
golden
air
of
early
autumn
;
but
,
*NL*
morally
speaking
,
she
retreated
before
them
--
facing
him
still
--
as
she
*NL*
had
retreated
in
the
other
cases
before
a
like
encounter
.
``
Oh
do
n't
say
*NL*
that
,
please
,
''
she
answered
with
an
intensity
that
expressed
the
dread
*NL*
of
having
,
in
this
case
too
,
to
choose
and
decide
.
What
made
her
dread
*NL*
great
was
precisely
the
force
which
,
as
it
would
seem
,
ought
to
have
*NL*
banished
all
dread
--
the
sense
of
something
within
herself
,
deep
down
,
*NL*
that
she
supposed
to
be
inspired
and
trustful
passion
.
It
was
there
*NL*
like
a
large
sum
stored
in
a
bank
--
which
there
was
a
terror
in
having
to
*NL*
begin
to
spend
.
If
she
touched
it
,
it
would
all
come
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
the
idea
that
it
will
matter
much
to
you
,
''
said
Osmond
.
``
I
've
*NL*
too
little
to
offer
you
.
What
I
have
--
it
's
enough
for
me
;
but
it
's
not
*NL*
enough
for
you
.
I
've
neither
fortune
,
nor
fame
,
nor
extrinsic
advantages
*NL*
of
any
kind
.
So
I
offer
nothing
.
I
only
tell
you
because
I
think
it
*NL*
ca
n't
offend
you
,
and
some
day
or
other
it
may
give
you
pleasure
.
It
*NL*
gives
me
pleasure
,
I
assure
you
,
''
he
went
on
,
standing
there
before
her
,
*NL*
considerately
inclined
to
her
,
turning
his
hat
,
which
he
had
taken
*NL*
up
,
slowly
round
with
a
movement
which
had
all
the
decent
tremor
of
*NL*
awkwardness
and
none
of
its
oddity
,
and
presenting
to
her
his
firm
,
*NL*
refined
,
slightly
ravaged
face
.
``
It
gives
me
no
pain
,
because
it
's
*NL*
perfectly
simple
.
For
me
you
'll
always
be
the
most
important
woman
in
*NL*
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
looked
at
herself
in
this
character
--
looked
intently
,
thinking
*NL*
she
filled
it
with
a
certain
grace
.
But
what
she
said
was
not
an
*NL*
expression
of
any
such
complacency
.
``
You
do
n't
offend
me
;
but
you
*NL*
ought
to
remember
that
,
without
being
offended
,
one
may
be
incommoded
,
*NL*
troubled
.
''
``
Incommoded
,
''
she
heard
herself
saying
that
,
and
it
struck
*NL*
her
as
a
ridiculous
word
.
But
it
was
what
stupidly
came
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
perfectly
.
Of
course
you
're
surprised
and
startled
.
But
*NL*
if
it
's
nothing
but
that
,
it
will
pass
away
.
And
it
will
perhaps
leave
*NL*
something
that
I
may
not
be
ashamed
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
it
may
leave
.
You
see
at
all
events
that
I
'm
not
*NL*
overwhelmed
,
''
said
Isabel
with
rather
a
pale
smile
.
``
I
'm
not
too
*NL*
troubled
to
think
.
And
I
think
that
I
'm
glad
I
leave
Rome
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
at
all
KNOW
you
,
''
she
added
abruptly
;
and
then
she
coloured
as
*NL*
she
heard
herself
saying
what
she
had
said
almost
a
year
before
to
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
not
going
away
you
'd
know
me
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
do
that
some
other
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
.
I
'm
very
easy
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
she
emphatically
answered
--
``
there
you
're
not
sincere
.
You
're
*NL*
not
easy
to
know
;
no
one
could
be
less
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
laughed
,
``
I
said
that
because
I
know
myself
.
It
may
be
a
*NL*
boast
,
but
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
;
but
you
're
very
wise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
are
you
,
Miss
Archer
!
''
Osmond
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
feel
so
just
now
.
Still
,
I
'm
wise
enough
to
think
you
had
*NL*
better
go
.
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
!
''
said
Gilbert
Osmond
,
taking
the
hand
which
she
failed
*NL*
to
surrender
.
After
which
he
added
:
``
If
we
meet
again
you
'll
find
me
as
*NL*
you
leave
me
.
If
we
do
n't
I
shall
be
so
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
very
much
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
quietly
firm
about
Isabel
's
visitor
;
he
might
go
of
*NL*
his
own
movement
,
but
would
n't
be
dismissed
.
``
There
's
one
thing
more
.
*NL*
I
have
n't
asked
anything
of
you
--
not
even
a
thought
in
the
future
;
you
*NL*
must
do
me
that
justice
.
But
there
's
a
little
service
I
should
like
to
*NL*
ask
.
I
shall
not
return
home
for
several
days
;
Rome
's
delightful
,
and
*NL*
it
's
a
good
place
for
a
man
in
my
state
of
mind
.
Oh
,
I
know
you
're
sorry
*NL*
to
leave
it
;
but
you
're
right
to
do
what
your
aunt
wishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
even
wish
it
!
''
Isabel
broke
out
strangely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
was
apparently
on
the
point
of
saying
something
that
would
match
*NL*
these
words
,
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
rejoined
simply
:
``
Ah
well
,
it
's
*NL*
proper
you
should
go
with
her
,
very
proper
.
Do
everything
that
's
proper
;
*NL*
I
go
in
for
that
.
Excuse
my
being
so
patronising
.
You
say
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
me
,
but
when
you
do
you
'll
discover
what
a
worship
I
have
for
*NL*
propriety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
conventional
?
''
Isabel
gravely
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
the
way
you
utter
that
word
!
No
,
I
'm
not
conventional
:
I
'm
*NL*
convention
itself
.
You
do
n't
understand
that
?
''
And
he
paused
a
moment
,
*NL*
smiling
.
``
I
should
like
to
explain
it
.
''
Then
with
a
sudden
,
quick
,
*NL*
bright
naturalness
,
``
Do
come
back
again
,
''
he
pleaded
.
``
There
are
so
many
*NL*
things
we
might
talk
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
there
with
lowered
eyes
.
``
What
service
did
you
speak
of
just
*NL*
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
see
my
little
daughter
before
you
leave
Florence
.
She
's
alone
at
*NL*
the
villa
;
I
decided
not
to
send
her
to
my
sister
,
who
has
n't
at
all
my
*NL*
ideas
.
Tell
her
she
must
love
her
poor
father
very
much
,
''
said
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
go
,
''
Isabel
answered
.
``
I
'll
tell
*NL*
her
what
you
say
.
Once
more
good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
he
took
a
rapid
,
respectful
leave
.
When
he
had
gone
she
stood
*NL*
a
moment
looking
about
her
and
seated
herself
slowly
and
with
an
air
of
*NL*
deliberation
.
She
sat
there
till
her
companions
came
back
,
with
*NL*
folded
hands
,
gazing
at
the
ugly
carpet
.
Her
agitation
--
for
it
had
not
*NL*
diminished
--
was
very
still
,
very
deep
.
What
had
happened
was
something
*NL*
that
for
a
week
past
her
imagination
had
been
going
forward
to
meet
;
but
*NL*
here
,
when
it
came
,
she
stopped
--
that
sublime
principle
somehow
broke
*NL*
down
.
The
working
of
this
young
lady
's
spirit
was
strange
,
and
I
can
*NL*
only
give
it
to
you
as
I
see
it
,
not
hoping
to
make
it
seem
altogether
*NL*
natural
.
Her
imagination
,
as
I
say
,
now
hung
back
:
there
was
a
last
*NL*
vague
space
it
could
n't
cross
--
a
dusky
,
uncertain
tract
which
looked
*NL*
ambiguous
and
even
slightly
treacherous
,
like
a
moorland
seen
in
the
*NL*
winter
twilight
.
But
she
was
to
cross
it
yet
.

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
on
the
morrow
to
Florence
,
under
her
cousin
's
escort
,
and
*NL*
Ralph
Touchett
,
though
usually
restive
under
railway
discipline
,
thought
*NL*
very
well
of
the
successive
hours
passed
in
the
train
that
hurried
*NL*
his
companion
away
from
the
city
now
distinguished
by
Gilbert
Osmond
's
*NL*
preference
--
hours
that
were
to
form
the
first
stage
in
a
larger
scheme
*NL*
of
travel
.
Miss
Stackpole
had
remained
behind
;
she
was
planning
a
little
*NL*
trip
to
Naples
,
to
be
carried
out
with
Mr.
Bantling
's
aid
.
Isabel
was
*NL*
to
have
three
days
in
Florence
before
the
4th
of
June
,
the
date
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
's
departure
,
and
she
determined
to
devote
the
last
of
these
*NL*
to
her
promise
to
call
on
Pansy
Osmond
.
Her
plan
,
however
,
seemed
for
*NL*
a
moment
likely
to
modify
itself
in
deference
to
an
idea
of
Madame
*NL*
Merle
's
.
This
lady
was
still
at
Casa
Touchett
;
but
she
too
was
on
the
*NL*
point
of
leaving
Florence
,
her
next
station
being
an
ancient
castle
*NL*
in
the
mountains
of
Tuscany
,
the
residence
of
a
noble
family
of
that
*NL*
country
,
whose
acquaintance
-LRB-
she
had
known
them
,
as
she
said
,
``
forever
''
-RRB-
*NL*
seemed
to
Isabel
,
in
the
light
of
certain
photographs
of
their
immense
*NL*
crenellated
dwelling
which
her
friend
was
able
to
show
her
,
a
precious
*NL*
privilege
.
She
mentioned
to
this
fortunate
woman
that
Mr.
Osmond
had
*NL*
asked
her
to
take
a
look
at
his
daughter
,
but
did
n't
mention
that
he
had
*NL*
also
made
her
a
declaration
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
comme
cela
se
trouve
!
''
Madame
Merle
exclaimed
.
``
I
myself
have
been
*NL*
thinking
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
pay
the
child
a
little
visit
before
I
*NL*
go
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
go
together
then
,
''
Isabel
reasonably
said
:
``
reasonably
''
because
*NL*
the
proposal
was
not
uttered
in
the
spirit
of
enthusiasm
.
She
had
*NL*
prefigured
her
small
pilgrimage
as
made
in
solitude
;
she
should
like
*NL*
it
better
so
.
She
was
nevertheless
prepared
to
sacrifice
this
mystic
*NL*
sentiment
to
her
great
consideration
for
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
personage
finely
meditated
.
``
After
all
,
why
should
we
both
go
;
*NL*
having
,
each
of
us
,
so
much
to
do
during
these
last
hours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
;
I
can
easily
go
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
your
going
alone
--
to
the
house
of
a
handsome
*NL*
bachelor
.
He
has
been
married
--
but
so
long
ago
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
stared
.
``
When
Mr.
Osmond
's
away
what
does
it
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
know
he
's
away
,
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
?
Whom
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
one

But
perhaps
it
does
n't
signify
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
going
why
should
n't
I
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
'm
an
old
frump
and
you
're
a
beautiful
young
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Granting
all
that
,
you
've
not
promised

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
you
think
of
your
promises
!
''
said
the
elder
woman
in
mild
*NL*
mockery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
a
great
deal
of
my
promises
.
Does
that
surprise
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right

''
Madame
Merle
audibly
reflected
.
``
I
really
think
you
wish
*NL*
to
be
kind
to
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
very
much
to
be
kind
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
see
her
then
;
no
one
will
be
the
wiser
.
And
tell
her
I
'd
have
*NL*
come
if
you
had
n't

Or
rather
,
''
Madame
Merle
added
,
``
DO
N'T
tell

She
*NL*
wo
n't

*NL*

As
Isabel
drove
,
in
the
publicity
of
an
open
vehicle
,
along
the
winding
*NL*
way
which
led
to
Mr.
Osmond
's
hill-top
,
she
wondered
what
her
friend
had
*NL*
meant
by
no
one
's
being
the
wiser
.
Once
in
a
while
,
at
large
intervals
,
*NL*
this
lady
,
whose
voyaging
discretion
,
as
a
general
thing
,
was
rather
of
*NL*
the
open
sea
than
of
the
risky
channel
,
dropped
a
remark
of
ambiguous
*NL*
quality
,
struck
a
note
that
sounded
false
.
What
cared
Isabel
Archer
for
*NL*
the
vulgar
judgements
of
obscure
people
?
and
did
Madame
Merle
suppose
*NL*
that
she
was
capable
of
doing
a
thing
at
all
if
it
had
to
be
sneakingly
*NL*
done
?
Of
course
not
:
she
must
have
meant
something
else
--
something
which
*NL*
in
the
press
of
the
hours
that
preceded
her
departure
she
had
not
had
*NL*
time
to
explain
.
Isabel
would
return
to
this
some
day
;
there
were
sorts
*NL*
of
things
as
to
which
she
liked
to
be
clear
.
She
heard
Pansy
strumming
*NL*
at
the
piano
in
another
place
as
she
herself
was
ushered
into
Mr.
*NL*
Osmond
's
drawing-room
;
the
little
girl
was
``
practising
,
''
and
Isabel
was
*NL*
pleased
to
think
she
performed
this
duty
with
rigour
.
She
immediately
*NL*
came
in
,
smoothing
down
her
frock
,
and
did
the
honours
of
her
father
's
*NL*
house
with
a
wide-eyed
earnestness
of
courtesy
.
Isabel
sat
there
half
an
*NL*
hour
,
and
Pansy
rose
to
the
occasion
as
the
small
,
winged
fairy
in
the
*NL*
pantomime
soars
by
the
aid
of
the
dissimulated
wire
--
not
chattering
,
but
*NL*
conversing
,
and
showing
the
same
respectful
interest
in
Isabel
's
affairs
*NL*
that
Isabel
was
so
good
as
to
take
in
hers
.
Isabel
wondered
at
her
;
*NL*
she
had
never
had
so
directly
presented
to
her
nose
the
white
flower
*NL*
of
cultivated
sweetness
.
How
well
the
child
had
been
taught
,
said
our
*NL*
admiring
young
woman
;
how
prettily
she
had
been
directed
and
fashioned
;
*NL*
and
yet
how
simple
,
how
natural
,
how
innocent
she
had
been
kept
!
Isabel
*NL*
was
fond
,
ever
,
of
the
question
of
character
and
quality
,
of
sounding
,
*NL*
as
who
should
say
,
the
deep
personal
mystery
,
and
it
had
pleased
her
,
*NL*
up
to
this
time
,
to
be
in
doubt
as
to
whether
this
tender
slip
were
not
*NL*
really
all-knowing
.
Was
the
extremity
of
her
candour
but
the
perfection
*NL*
of
self-consciousness
?
Was
it
put
on
to
please
her
father
's
visitor
,
*NL*
or
was
it
the
direct
expression
of
an
unspotted
nature
?
The
hour
that
*NL*
Isabel
spent
in
Mr.
Osmond
's
beautiful
empty
,
dusky
rooms
--
the
windows
*NL*
had
been
half-darkened
,
to
keep
out
the
heat
,
and
here
and
there
,
*NL*
through
an
easy
crevice
,
the
splendid
summer
day
peeped
in
,
lighting
a
*NL*
gleam
of
faded
colour
or
tarnished
gilt
in
the
rich
gloom
--
her
interview
*NL*
with
the
daughter
of
the
house
,
I
say
,
effectually
settled
this
*NL*
question
.
Pansy
was
really
a
blank
page
,
a
pure
white
surface
,
*NL*
successfully
kept
so
;
she
had
neither
art
,
nor
guile
,
nor
temper
,
nor
*NL*
talent
--
only
two
or
three
small
exquisite
instincts
:
for
knowing
a
*NL*
friend
,
for
avoiding
a
mistake
,
for
taking
care
of
an
old
toy
or
a
new
*NL*
frock
.
Yet
to
be
so
tender
was
to
be
touching
withal
,
and
she
could
*NL*
be
felt
as
an
easy
victim
of
fate
.
She
would
have
no
will
,
no
power
to
*NL*
resist
,
no
sense
of
her
own
importance
;
she
would
easily
be
mystified
,
*NL*
easily
crushed
:
her
force
would
be
all
in
knowing
when
and
where
to
*NL*
cling
.
She
moved
about
the
place
with
her
visitor
,
who
had
asked
leave
*NL*
to
walk
through
the
other
rooms
again
,
where
Pansy
gave
her
judgement
on
*NL*
several
works
of
art
.
She
spoke
of
her
prospects
,
her
occupations
,
her
*NL*
father
's
intentions
;
she
was
not
egotistical
,
but
felt
the
propriety
*NL*
of
supplying
the
information
so
distinguished
a
guest
would
naturally
*NL*
expect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
tell
me
,
''
she
said
,
``
did
papa
,
in
Rome
,
go
to
see
Madame
*NL*
Catherine
?
He
told
me
he
would
if
he
had
time
.
Perhaps
he
had
not
time
.
*NL*
Papa
likes
a
great
deal
of
time
.
He
wished
to
speak
about
my
education
;
*NL*
it
is
n't
finished
yet
,
you
know
.
I
do
n't
know
what
they
can
do
with
me
*NL*
more
;
but
it
appears
it
's
far
from
finished
.
Papa
told
me
one
day
he
*NL*
thought
he
would
finish
it
himself
;
for
the
last
year
or
two
,
at
the
*NL*
convent
,
the
masters
that
teach
the
tall
girls
are
so
very
dear
.
Papa
's
*NL*
not
rich
,
and
I
should
be
very
sorry
if
he
were
to
pay
much
money
for
*NL*
me
,
because
I
do
n't
think
I
'm
worth
it
.
I
do
n't
learn
quickly
enough
,
*NL*
and
I
have
no
memory
.
For
what
I
'm
told
,
yes
--
especially
when
it
's
*NL*
pleasant
;
but
not
for
what
I
learn
in
a
book
.
There
was
a
young
girl
who
*NL*
was
my
best
friend
,
and
they
took
her
away
from
the
convent
,
when
she
*NL*
was
fourteen
,
to
make
--
how
do
you
say
it
in
English
?
--
to
make
a
dot
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
say
it
in
English
?
I
hope
it
is
n't
wrong
;
I
only
mean
they
wished
*NL*
to
keep
the
money
to
marry
her
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
is
for
that
that
*NL*
papa
wishes
to
keep
the
money
--
to
marry
me
.
It
costs
so
much
to
marry
!
''
*NL*
Pansy
went
on
with
a
sigh
;
``
I
think
papa
might
make
that
economy
.
At
*NL*
any
rate
I
'm
too
young
to
think
about
it
yet
,
and
I
do
n't
care
for
any
*NL*
gentleman
;
I
mean
for
any
but
him
.
If
he
were
not
my
papa
I
should
like
*NL*
to
marry
him
;
I
would
rather
be
his
daughter
than
the
wife
of
--
of
some
*NL*
strange
person
.
I
miss
him
very
much
,
but
not
so
much
as
you
might
*NL*
think
,
for
I
've
been
so
much
away
from
him
.
Papa
has
always
been
*NL*
principally
for
holidays
.
I
miss
Madame
Catherine
almost
more
;
but
you
*NL*
must
not
tell
him
that
.
You
shall
not
see
him
again
?
I
'm
very
sorry
,
*NL*
and
he
'll
be
sorry
too
.
Of
everyone
who
comes
here
I
like
you
the
best
.
*NL*
That
's
not
a
great
compliment
,
for
there
are
not
many
people
.
It
was
*NL*
very
kind
of
you
to
come
to-day
--
so
far
from
your
house
;
for
I
'm
really
*NL*
as
yet
only
a
child
.
Oh
,
yes
,
I
've
only
the
occupations
of
a
child
.
When
*NL*
did
YOU
give
them
up
,
the
occupations
of
a
child
?
I
should
like
to
know
*NL*
how
old
you
are
,
but
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
's
right
to
ask
.
At
the
*NL*
convent
they
told
us
that
we
must
never
ask
the
age
.
I
do
n't
like
to
do
*NL*
anything
that
's
not
expected
;
it
looks
as
if
one
had
not
been
properly
*NL*
taught
.
I
myself
--
I
should
never
like
to
be
taken
by
surprise
.
Papa
left
*NL*
directions
for
everything
.
I
go
to
bed
very
early
.
When
the
sun
goes
off
*NL*
that
side
I
go
into
the
garden
.
Papa
left
strict
orders
that
I
was
not
*NL*
to
get
scorched
.
I
always
enjoy
the
view
;
the
mountains
are
so
graceful
.
*NL*
In
Rome
,
from
the
convent
,
we
saw
nothing
but
roofs
and
bell-towers
.
I
*NL*
practise
three
hours
.
I
do
n't
play
very
well
.
You
play
yourself
?
I
wish
*NL*
very
much
you
'd
play
something
for
me
;
papa
has
the
idea
that
I
should
*NL*
hear
good
music
.
Madame
Merle
has
played
for
me
several
times
;
that
's
*NL*
what
I
like
best
about
Madame
Merle
;
she
has
great
facility
.
I
shall
*NL*
never
have
facility
.
And
I
've
no
voice
--
just
a
small
sound
like
the
*NL*
squeak
of
a
slate-pencil
making
flourishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
gratified
this
respectful
wish
,
drew
off
her
gloves
and
sat
down
*NL*
to
the
piano
,
while
Pansy
,
standing
beside
her
,
watched
her
white
*NL*
hands
move
quickly
over
the
keys
.
When
she
stopped
she
kissed
the
child
*NL*
good-bye
,
held
her
close
,
looked
at
her
long
.
``
Be
very
good
,
''
she
said
;
*NL*
``
give
pleasure
to
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
's
what
I
live
for
,
''
Pansy
answered
.
``
He
has
not
much
*NL*
pleasure
;
he
's
rather
a
sad
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
listened
to
this
assertion
with
an
interest
which
she
felt
it
*NL*
almost
a
torment
to
be
obliged
to
conceal
.
It
was
her
pride
that
obliged
*NL*
her
,
and
a
certain
sense
of
decency
;
there
were
still
other
things
in
*NL*
her
head
which
she
felt
a
strong
impulse
,
instantly
checked
,
to
say
*NL*
to
Pansy
about
her
father
;
there
were
things
it
would
have
given
her
*NL*
pleasure
to
hear
the
child
,
to
make
the
child
,
say
.
But
she
no
sooner
*NL*
became
conscious
of
these
things
than
her
imagination
was
hushed
with
*NL*
horror
at
the
idea
of
taking
advantage
of
the
little
girl
--
it
was
of
*NL*
this
she
would
have
accused
herself
--
and
of
exhaling
into
that
air
where
*NL*
he
might
still
have
a
subtle
sense
for
it
any
breath
of
her
charmed
*NL*
state
.
She
had
come
--
she
had
come
;
but
she
had
stayed
only
an
hour
.
She
*NL*
rose
quickly
from
the
music-stool
;
even
then
,
however
,
she
lingered
a
*NL*
moment
,
still
holding
her
small
companion
,
drawing
the
child
's
sweet
*NL*
slimness
closer
and
looking
down
at
her
almost
in
envy
.
She
was
obliged
*NL*
to
confess
it
to
herself
--
she
would
have
taken
a
passionate
pleasure
in
*NL*
talking
of
Gilbert
Osmond
to
this
innocent
,
diminutive
creature
who
*NL*
was
so
near
him
.
But
she
said
no
other
word
;
she
only
kissed
Pansy
once
*NL*
again
.
They
went
together
through
the
vestibule
,
to
the
door
that
*NL*
opened
on
the
court
;
and
there
her
young
hostess
stopped
,
looking
rather
*NL*
wistfully
beyond
.
``
I
may
go
no
further
.
I
've
promised
papa
not
to
pass
*NL*
this
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right
to
obey
him
;
he
'll
never
ask
you
anything
unreasonable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
always
obey
him
.
But
when
will
you
come
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
a
long
time
,
I
'm
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
you
can
,
I
hope
.
I
'm
only
a
little
girl
,
''
said
Pansy
,
``
but
*NL*
I
shall
always
expect
you
.
''
And
the
small
figure
stood
in
the
high
,
dark
*NL*
doorway
,
watching
Isabel
cross
the
clear
,
grey
court
and
disappear
into
*NL*
the
brightness
beyond
the
big
portone
,
which
gave
a
wider
dazzle
as
it
*NL*
opened
.

CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
came
back
to
Florence
,
but
only
after
several
months
;
an
interval
*NL*
sufficiently
replete
with
incident
.
It
is
not
,
however
,
during
this
*NL*
interval
that
we
are
closely
concerned
with
her
;
our
attention
is
*NL*
engaged
again
on
a
certain
day
in
the
late
spring-time
,
shortly
after
*NL*
her
return
to
Palazzo
Crescentini
and
a
year
from
the
date
of
the
*NL*
incidents
just
narrated
.
She
was
alone
on
this
occasion
,
in
one
of
the
*NL*
smaller
of
the
numerous
rooms
devoted
by
Mrs.
Touchett
to
social
uses
,
*NL*
and
there
was
that
in
her
expression
and
attitude
which
would
have
*NL*
suggested
that
she
was
expecting
a
visitor
.
The
tall
window
was
open
,
*NL*
and
though
its
green
shutters
were
partly
drawn
the
bright
air
of
the
*NL*
garden
had
come
in
through
a
broad
interstice
and
filled
the
room
with
*NL*
warmth
and
perfume
.
Our
young
woman
stood
near
it
for
some
time
,
her
*NL*
hands
clasped
behind
her
;
she
gazed
abroad
with
the
vagueness
of
unrest
.
*NL*
Too
troubled
for
attention
she
moved
in
a
vain
circle
.
Yet
it
could
not
*NL*
be
in
her
thought
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
visitor
before
he
should
*NL*
pass
into
the
house
,
since
the
entrance
to
the
palace
was
not
through
*NL*
the
garden
,
in
which
stillness
and
privacy
always
reigned
.
She
wished
*NL*
rather
to
forestall
his
arrival
by
a
process
of
conjecture
,
and
to
judge
*NL*
by
the
expression
of
her
face
this
attempt
gave
her
plenty
to
do
.
Grave
*NL*
she
found
herself
,
and
positively
more
weighted
,
as
by
the
experience
of
*NL*
the
lapse
of
the
year
she
had
spent
in
seeing
the
world
.
She
had
ranged
,
*NL*
she
would
have
said
,
through
space
and
surveyed
much
of
mankind
,
and
*NL*
was
therefore
now
,
in
her
own
eyes
,
a
very
different
person
from
the
*NL*
frivolous
young
woman
from
Albany
who
had
begun
to
take
the
measure
*NL*
of
Europe
on
the
lawn
at
Gardencourt
a
couple
of
years
before
.
She
*NL*
flattered
herself
she
had
harvested
wisdom
and
learned
a
great
deal
*NL*
more
of
life
than
this
light-minded
creature
had
even
suspected
.
If
*NL*
her
thoughts
just
now
had
inclined
themselves
to
retrospect
,
instead
*NL*
of
fluttering
their
wings
nervously
about
the
present
,
they
would
have
*NL*
evoked
a
multitude
of
interesting
pictures
.
These
pictures
would
have
*NL*
been
both
landscapes
and
figure-pieces
;
the
latter
,
however
,
would
have
*NL*
been
the
more
numerous
.
With
several
of
the
images
that
might
have
been
*NL*
projected
on
such
a
field
we
are
already
acquainted
.
There
would
be
for
*NL*
instance
the
conciliatory
Lily
,
our
heroine
's
sister
and
Edmund
Ludlow
's
*NL*
wife
,
who
had
come
out
from
New
York
to
spend
five
months
with
her
*NL*
relative
.
She
had
left
her
husband
behind
her
,
but
had
brought
*NL*
her
children
,
to
whom
Isabel
now
played
with
equal
munificence
and
*NL*
tenderness
the
part
of
maiden-aunt
.
Mr.
Ludlow
,
toward
the
last
,
had
*NL*
been
able
to
snatch
a
few
weeks
from
his
forensic
triumphs
and
,
crossing
*NL*
the
ocean
with
extreme
rapidity
,
had
spent
a
month
with
the
two
ladies
*NL*
in
Paris
before
taking
his
wife
home
.
The
little
Ludlows
had
not
yet
,
*NL*
even
from
the
American
point
of
view
,
reached
the
proper
tourist-age
;
so
*NL*
that
while
her
sister
was
with
her
Isabel
had
confined
her
movements
to
*NL*
a
narrow
circle
.
Lily
and
the
babies
had
joined
her
in
Switzerland
in
*NL*
the
month
of
July
,
and
they
had
spent
a
summer
of
fine
weather
in
an
*NL*
Alpine
valley
where
the
flowers
were
thick
in
the
meadows
and
the
shade
*NL*
of
great
chestnuts
made
a
resting-place
for
such
upward
wanderings
as
*NL*
might
be
undertaken
by
ladies
and
children
on
warm
afternoons
.
They
had
*NL*
afterwards
reached
the
French
capital
,
which
was
worshipped
,
and
with
*NL*
costly
ceremonies
,
by
Lily
,
but
thought
of
as
noisily
vacant
by
Isabel
,
*NL*
who
in
these
days
made
use
of
her
memory
of
Rome
as
she
might
have
done
,
*NL*
in
a
hot
and
crowded
room
,
of
a
phial
of
something
pungent
hidden
in
her
*NL*
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Ludlow
sacrificed
,
as
I
say
,
to
Paris
,
yet
had
doubts
and
*NL*
wonderments
not
allayed
at
that
altar
;
and
after
her
husband
had
joined
*NL*
her
found
further
chagrin
in
his
failure
to
throw
himself
into
these
*NL*
speculations
.
They
all
had
Isabel
for
subject
;
but
Edmund
Ludlow
,
as
*NL*
he
had
always
done
before
,
declined
to
be
surprised
,
or
distressed
,
or
*NL*
mystified
,
or
elated
,
at
anything
his
sister-in-law
might
have
done
*NL*
or
have
failed
to
do
.
Mrs.
Ludlow
's
mental
motions
were
sufficiently
*NL*
various
.
At
one
moment
she
thought
it
would
be
so
natural
for
that
young
*NL*
woman
to
come
home
and
take
a
house
in
New
York
--
the
Rossiters
'
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
which
had
an
elegant
conservatory
and
was
just
round
the
*NL*
corner
from
her
own
;
at
another
she
could
n't
conceal
her
surprise
at
the
*NL*
girl
's
not
marrying
some
member
of
one
of
the
great
aristocracies
.
On
*NL*
the
whole
,
as
I
have
said
,
she
had
fallen
from
high
communion
with
the
*NL*
probabilities
.
She
had
taken
more
satisfaction
in
Isabel
's
accession
of
*NL*
fortune
than
if
the
money
had
been
left
to
herself
;
it
had
seemed
to
her
*NL*
to
offer
just
the
proper
setting
for
her
sister
's
slightly
meagre
,
but
*NL*
scarce
the
less
eminent
figure
.
Isabel
had
developed
less
,
however
,
than
*NL*
Lily
had
thought
likely
--
development
,
to
Lily
's
understanding
,
being
*NL*
somehow
mysteriously
connected
with
morning-calls
and
evening-parties
.
*NL*
Intellectually
,
doubtless
,
she
had
made
immense
strides
;
but
she
*NL*
appeared
to
have
achieved
few
of
those
social
conquests
of
which
Mrs.
*NL*
Ludlow
had
expected
to
admire
the
trophies
.
Lily
's
conception
of
such
*NL*
achievements
was
extremely
vague
;
but
this
was
exactly
what
she
had
*NL*
expected
of
Isabel
--
to
give
it
form
and
body
.
Isabel
could
have
done
*NL*
as
well
as
she
had
done
in
New
York
;
and
Mrs.
Ludlow
appealed
to
her
*NL*
husband
to
know
whether
there
was
any
privilege
she
enjoyed
in
Europe
*NL*
which
the
society
of
that
city
might
not
offer
her
.
We
know
ourselves
*NL*
that
Isabel
had
made
conquests
--
whether
inferior
or
not
to
those
she
*NL*
might
have
effected
in
her
native
land
it
would
be
a
delicate
matter
to
*NL*
decide
;
and
it
is
not
altogether
with
a
feeling
of
complacency
that
*NL*
I
again
mention
that
she
had
not
rendered
these
honourable
victories
*NL*
public
.
She
had
not
told
her
sister
the
history
of
Lord
Warburton
,
nor
*NL*
had
she
given
her
a
hint
of
Mr.
Osmond
's
state
of
mind
;
and
she
had
had
*NL*
no
better
reason
for
her
silence
than
that
she
did
n't
wish
to
speak
.
*NL*
It
was
more
romantic
to
say
nothing
,
and
,
drinking
deep
,
in
secret
,
of
*NL*
romance
,
she
was
as
little
disposed
to
ask
poor
Lily
's
advice
as
she
*NL*
would
have
been
to
close
that
rare
volume
forever
.
But
Lily
knew
nothing
*NL*
of
these
discriminations
,
and
could
only
pronounce
her
sister
's
career
*NL*
a
strange
anti-climax
--
an
impression
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
Isabel
's
*NL*
silence
about
Mr.
Osmond
,
for
instance
,
was
in
direct
proportion
to
the
*NL*
frequency
with
which
he
occupied
her
thoughts
.
As
this
happened
very
*NL*
often
it
sometimes
appeared
to
Mrs.
Ludlow
that
she
had
lost
her
*NL*
courage
.
So
uncanny
a
result
of
so
exhilarating
an
incident
as
*NL*
inheriting
a
fortune
was
of
course
perplexing
to
the
cheerful
Lily
;
it
*NL*
added
to
her
general
sense
that
Isabel
was
not
at
all
like
other
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
young
lady
's
courage
,
however
,
might
have
been
taken
as
reaching
*NL*
its
height
after
her
relations
had
gone
home
.
She
could
imagine
braver
*NL*
things
than
spending
the
winter
in
Paris
--
Paris
had
sides
by
which
it
*NL*
so
resembled
New
York
,
Paris
was
like
smart
,
neat
prose
--
and
her
close
*NL*
correspondence
with
Madame
Merle
did
much
to
stimulate
such
flights
.
She
*NL*
had
never
had
a
keener
sense
of
freedom
,
of
the
absolute
boldness
and
*NL*
wantonness
of
liberty
,
than
when
she
turned
away
from
the
platform
*NL*
at
the
Euston
Station
on
one
of
the
last
days
of
November
,
after
the
*NL*
departure
of
the
train
that
was
to
convey
poor
Lily
,
her
husband
and
her
*NL*
children
to
their
ship
at
Liverpool
.
It
had
been
good
for
her
to
regale
;
*NL*
she
was
very
conscious
of
that
;
she
was
very
observant
,
as
we
know
,
of
*NL*
what
was
good
for
her
,
and
her
effort
was
constantly
to
find
something
*NL*
that
was
good
enough
.
To
profit
by
the
present
advantage
till
the
latest
*NL*
moment
she
had
made
the
journey
from
Paris
with
the
unenvied
travellers
.
*NL*
She
would
have
accompanied
them
to
Liverpool
as
well
,
only
Edmund
Ludlow
*NL*
had
asked
her
,
as
a
favour
,
not
to
do
so
;
it
made
Lily
so
fidgety
and
*NL*
she
asked
such
impossible
questions
.
Isabel
watched
the
train
move
away
;
*NL*
she
kissed
her
hand
to
the
elder
of
her
small
nephews
,
a
demonstrative
*NL*
child
who
leaned
dangerously
far
out
of
the
window
of
the
carriage
and
*NL*
made
separation
an
occasion
of
violent
hilarity
,
and
then
she
walked
*NL*
back
into
the
foggy
London
street
.
The
world
lay
before
her
--
she
could
*NL*
do
whatever
she
chose
.
There
was
a
deep
thrill
in
it
all
,
but
for
the
*NL*
present
her
choice
was
tolerably
discreet
;
she
chose
simply
to
walk
back
*NL*
from
Euston
Square
to
her
hotel
.
The
early
dusk
of
a
November
afternoon
*NL*
had
already
closed
in
;
the
street-lamps
,
in
the
thick
,
brown
air
,
looked
*NL*
weak
and
red
;
our
heroine
was
unattended
and
Euston
Square
was
a
long
*NL*
way
from
Piccadilly
.
But
Isabel
performed
the
journey
with
a
positive
*NL*
enjoyment
of
its
dangers
and
lost
her
way
almost
on
purpose
,
in
order
*NL*
to
get
more
sensations
,
so
that
she
was
disappointed
when
an
obliging
*NL*
policeman
easily
set
her
right
again
.
She
was
so
fond
of
the
spectacle
*NL*
of
human
life
that
she
enjoyed
even
the
aspect
of
gathering
dusk
in
the
*NL*
London
streets
--
the
moving
crowds
,
the
hurrying
cabs
,
the
lighted
shops
,
*NL*
the
flaring
stalls
,
the
dark
,
shining
dampness
of
everything
.
That
*NL*
evening
,
at
her
hotel
,
she
wrote
to
Madame
Merle
that
she
should
start
*NL*
in
a
day
or
two
for
Rome
.
She
made
her
way
down
to
Rome
without
touching
*NL*
at
Florence
--
having
gone
first
to
Venice
and
then
proceeded
southward
by
*NL*
Ancona
.
She
accomplished
this
journey
without
other
assistance
than
that
*NL*
of
her
servant
,
for
her
natural
protectors
were
not
now
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
Ralph
Touchett
was
spending
the
winter
at
Corfu
,
and
Miss
Stackpole
,
in
*NL*
the
September
previous
,
had
been
recalled
to
America
by
a
telegram
from
*NL*
the
Interviewer
.
This
journal
offered
its
brilliant
correspondent
a
*NL*
fresher
field
for
her
genius
than
the
mouldering
cities
of
Europe
,
and
*NL*
Henrietta
was
cheered
on
her
way
by
a
promise
from
Mr.
Bantling
that
*NL*
he
would
soon
come
over
to
see
her
.
Isabel
wrote
to
Mrs.
Touchett
to
*NL*
apologise
for
not
presenting
herself
just
yet
in
Florence
,
and
her
aunt
*NL*
replied
characteristically
enough
.
Apologies
,
Mrs.
Touchett
intimated
,
*NL*
were
of
no
more
use
to
her
than
bubbles
,
and
she
herself
never
dealt
*NL*
in
such
articles
.
One
either
did
the
thing
or
one
did
n't
,
and
what
one
*NL*
``
would
''
have
done
belonged
to
the
sphere
of
the
irrelevant
,
like
the
*NL*
idea
of
a
future
life
or
of
the
origin
of
things
.
Her
letter
was
frank
,
*NL*
but
-LRB-
a
rare
case
with
Mrs.
Touchett
-RRB-
not
so
frank
as
it
pretended
.
She
*NL*
easily
forgave
her
niece
for
not
stopping
at
Florence
,
because
she
*NL*
took
it
for
a
sign
that
Gilbert
Osmond
was
less
in
question
there
than
*NL*
formerly
.
She
watched
of
course
to
see
if
he
would
now
find
a
pretext
*NL*
for
going
to
Rome
,
and
derived
some
comfort
from
learning
that
he
had
*NL*
not
been
guilty
of
an
absence
.
Isabel
,
on
her
side
,
had
not
been
a
*NL*
fortnight
in
Rome
before
she
proposed
to
Madame
Merle
that
they
should
*NL*
make
a
little
pilgrimage
to
the
East
.
Madame
Merle
remarked
that
her
*NL*
friend
was
restless
,
but
she
added
that
she
herself
had
always
been
*NL*
consumed
with
the
desire
to
visit
Athens
and
Constantinople
.
The
two
*NL*
ladies
accordingly
embarked
on
this
expedition
,
and
spent
three
months
*NL*
in
Greece
,
in
Turkey
,
in
Egypt
.
Isabel
found
much
to
interest
her
in
*NL*
these
countries
,
though
Madame
Merle
continued
to
remark
that
even
among
*NL*
the
most
classic
sites
,
the
scenes
most
calculated
to
suggest
repose
*NL*
and
reflexion
,
a
certain
incoherence
prevailed
in
her
.
Isabel
travelled
*NL*
rapidly
and
recklessly
;
she
was
like
a
thirsty
person
draining
cup
*NL*
after
cup
.
Madame
Merle
meanwhile
,
as
lady-in-waiting
to
a
princess
*NL*
circulating
incognita
,
panted
a
little
in
her
rear
.
It
was
on
Isabel
's
*NL*
invitation
she
had
come
,
and
she
imparted
all
due
dignity
to
the
girl
's
*NL*
uncountenanced
state
.
She
played
her
part
with
the
tact
that
might
have
*NL*
been
expected
of
her
,
effacing
herself
and
accepting
the
position
of
a
*NL*
companion
whose
expenses
were
profusely
paid
.
The
situation
,
however
,
*NL*
had
no
hardships
,
and
people
who
met
this
reserved
though
striking
*NL*
pair
on
their
travels
would
not
have
been
able
to
tell
you
which
*NL*
was
patroness
and
which
client
.
To
say
that
Madame
Merle
improved
on
*NL*
acquaintance
states
meagrely
the
impression
she
made
on
her
friend
,
*NL*
who
had
found
her
from
the
first
so
ample
and
so
easy
.
At
the
end
of
an
*NL*
intimacy
of
three
months
Isabel
felt
she
knew
her
better
;
her
character
*NL*
had
revealed
itself
,
and
the
admirable
woman
had
also
at
last
redeemed
*NL*
her
promise
of
relating
her
history
from
her
own
point
of
view
--
a
*NL*
consummation
the
more
desirable
as
Isabel
had
already
heard
it
related
*NL*
from
the
point
of
view
of
others
.
This
history
was
so
sad
a
one
-LRB-
in
so
*NL*
far
as
it
concerned
the
late
M.
Merle
,
a
positive
adventurer
,
she
might
*NL*
say
,
though
originally
so
plausible
,
who
had
taken
advantage
,
years
*NL*
before
,
of
her
youth
and
of
an
inexperience
in
which
doubtless
those
who
*NL*
knew
her
only
now
would
find
it
difficult
to
believe
-RRB-
;
it
abounded
so
in
*NL*
startling
and
lamentable
incidents
that
her
companion
wondered
a
person
*NL*
so
eprouvee
could
have
kept
so
much
of
her
freshness
,
her
interest
in
*NL*
life
.
Into
this
freshness
of
Madame
Merle
's
she
obtained
a
considerable
*NL*
insight
;
she
seemed
to
see
it
as
professional
,
as
slightly
mechanical
,
*NL*
carried
about
in
its
case
like
the
fiddle
of
the
virtuoso
,
or
blanketed
*NL*
and
bridled
like
the
``
favourite
''
of
the
jockey
.
She
liked
her
as
much
*NL*
as
ever
,
but
there
was
a
corner
of
the
curtain
that
never
was
lifted
;
*NL*
it
was
as
if
she
had
remained
after
all
something
of
a
public
performer
,
*NL*
condemned
to
emerge
only
in
character
and
in
costume
.
She
had
once
*NL*
said
that
she
came
from
a
distance
,
that
she
belonged
to
the
``
old
,
old
''
*NL*
world
,
and
Isabel
never
lost
the
impression
that
she
was
the
product
of
*NL*
a
different
moral
or
social
clime
from
her
own
,
that
she
had
grown
up
*NL*
under
other
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
believed
then
that
at
bottom
she
had
a
different
morality
.
Of
course
*NL*
the
morality
of
civilised
persons
has
always
much
in
common
;
but
our
*NL*
young
woman
had
a
sense
in
her
of
values
gone
wrong
or
,
as
they
said
at
*NL*
the
shops
,
marked
down
.
She
considered
,
with
the
presumption
of
youth
,
*NL*
that
a
morality
differing
from
her
own
must
be
inferior
to
it
;
and
this
*NL*
conviction
was
an
aid
to
detecting
an
occasional
flash
of
cruelty
,
an
*NL*
occasional
lapse
from
candour
,
in
the
conversation
of
a
person
who
had
*NL*
raised
delicate
kindness
to
an
art
and
whose
pride
was
too
high
for
*NL*
the
narrow
ways
of
deception
.
Her
conception
of
human
motives
might
,
*NL*
in
certain
lights
,
have
been
acquired
at
the
court
of
some
kingdom
in
*NL*
decadence
,
and
there
were
several
in
her
list
of
which
our
heroine
had
*NL*
not
even
heard
.
She
had
not
heard
of
everything
,
that
was
very
plain
;
*NL*
and
there
were
evidently
things
in
the
world
of
which
it
was
not
*NL*
advantageous
to
hear
.
She
had
once
or
twice
had
a
positive
scare
;
since
*NL*
it
so
affected
her
to
have
to
exclaim
,
of
her
friend
,
``
Heaven
forgive
*NL*
her
,
she
does
n't
understand
me
!
''
Absurd
as
it
may
seem
this
discovery
*NL*
operated
as
a
shock
,
left
her
with
a
vague
dismay
in
which
there
was
*NL*
even
an
element
of
foreboding
.
The
dismay
of
course
subsided
,
in
the
*NL*
light
of
some
sudden
proof
of
Madame
Merle
's
remarkable
intelligence
;
*NL*
but
it
stood
for
a
high-water-mark
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
confidence
.
*NL*
Madame
Merle
had
once
declared
her
belief
that
when
a
friendship
ceases
*NL*
to
grow
it
immediately
begins
to
decline
--
there
being
no
point
of
*NL*
equilibrium
between
liking
more
and
liking
less
.
A
stationary
affection
,
*NL*
in
other
words
,
was
impossible
--
it
must
move
one
way
or
the
other
.
*NL*
However
that
might
be
,
the
girl
had
in
these
days
a
thousand
uses
for
*NL*
her
sense
of
the
romantic
,
which
was
more
active
than
it
had
ever
been
.
*NL*
I
do
not
allude
to
the
impulse
it
received
as
she
gazed
at
the
Pyramids
*NL*
in
the
course
of
an
excursion
from
Cairo
,
or
as
she
stood
among
the
*NL*
broken
columns
of
the
Acropolis
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
point
*NL*
designated
to
her
as
the
Strait
of
Salamis
;
deep
and
memorable
as
these
*NL*
emotions
had
remained
.
She
came
back
by
the
last
of
March
from
Egypt
*NL*
and
Greece
and
made
another
stay
in
Rome
.
A
few
days
after
her
arrival
*NL*
Gilbert
Osmond
descended
from
Florence
and
remained
three
weeks
,
during
*NL*
which
the
fact
of
her
being
with
his
old
friend
Madame
Merle
,
in
whose
*NL*
house
she
had
gone
to
lodge
,
made
it
virtually
inevitable
that
he
*NL*
should
see
her
every
day
.
When
the
last
of
April
came
she
wrote
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
that
she
should
now
rejoice
to
accept
an
invitation
given
long
*NL*
before
,
and
went
to
pay
a
visit
at
Palazzo
Crescentini
,
Madame
Merle
on
*NL*
this
occasion
remaining
in
Rome
.
She
found
her
aunt
alone
;
her
cousin
*NL*
was
still
at
Corfu
.
Ralph
,
however
,
was
expected
in
Florence
from
day
*NL*
to
day
,
and
Isabel
,
who
had
not
seen
him
for
upwards
of
a
year
,
was
*NL*
prepared
to
give
him
the
most
affectionate
welcome
.

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
of
him
,
nevertheless
,
that
she
was
thinking
while
she
stood
*NL*
at
the
window
near
which
we
found
her
a
while
ago
,
and
it
was
not
of
any
*NL*
of
the
matters
I
have
rapidly
sketched
.
She
was
not
turned
to
the
past
,
*NL*
but
to
the
immediate
,
impending
hour
.
She
had
reason
to
expect
a
scene
,
*NL*
and
she
was
not
fond
of
scenes
.
She
was
not
asking
herself
what
she
*NL*
should
say
to
her
visitor
;
this
question
had
already
been
answered
.
What
*NL*
he
would
say
to
her
--
that
was
the
interesting
issue
.
It
could
be
nothing
*NL*
in
the
least
soothing
--
she
had
warrant
for
this
,
and
the
conviction
*NL*
doubtless
showed
in
the
cloud
on
her
brow
.
For
the
rest
,
however
,
all
*NL*
clearness
reigned
in
her
;
she
had
put
away
her
mourning
and
she
walked
*NL*
in
no
small
shimmering
splendour
.
She
only
,
felt
older
--
ever
so
much
,
*NL*
and
as
if
she
were
``
worth
more
''
for
it
,
like
some
curious
piece
in
an
*NL*
antiquary
's
collection
.
She
was
not
at
any
rate
left
indefinitely
to
her
*NL*
apprehensions
,
for
a
servant
at
last
stood
before
her
with
a
card
on
his
*NL*
tray
.
``
Let
the
gentleman
come
in
,
''
she
said
,
and
continued
to
gaze
out
*NL*
of
the
window
after
the
footman
had
retired
.
It
was
only
when
she
had
*NL*
heard
the
door
close
behind
the
person
who
presently
entered
that
she
*NL*
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
stood
there
--
stood
and
received
a
moment
,
from
head
to
*NL*
foot
,
the
bright
,
dry
gaze
with
which
she
rather
withheld
than
offered
*NL*
a
greeting
.
Whether
his
sense
of
maturity
had
kept
pace
with
Isabel
's
*NL*
we
shall
perhaps
presently
ascertain
;
let
me
say
meanwhile
that
to
*NL*
her
critical
glance
he
showed
nothing
of
the
injury
of
time
.
Straight
,
*NL*
strong
and
hard
,
there
was
nothing
in
his
appearance
that
spoke
*NL*
positively
either
of
youth
or
of
age
;
if
he
had
neither
innocence
nor
*NL*
weakness
,
so
he
had
no
practical
philosophy
.
His
jaw
showed
the
same
*NL*
voluntary
cast
as
in
earlier
days
;
but
a
crisis
like
the
present
had
in
*NL*
it
of
course
something
grim
.
He
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
travelled
*NL*
hard
;
he
said
nothing
at
first
,
as
if
he
had
been
out
of
breath
.
This
*NL*
gave
Isabel
time
to
make
a
reflexion
:
``
Poor
fellow
,
what
great
things
*NL*
he
's
capable
of
,
and
what
a
pity
he
should
waste
so
dreadfully
his
*NL*
splendid
force
!
What
a
pity
too
that
one
ca
n't
satisfy
everybody
!
''
It
*NL*
gave
her
time
to
do
more
to
say
at
the
end
of
a
minute
:
``
I
ca
n't
tell
*NL*
you
how
I
hoped
you
would
n't
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
doubt
of
that
.
''
And
he
looked
about
him
for
a
seat
.
Not
only
*NL*
had
he
come
,
but
he
meant
to
settle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
very
tired
,
''
said
Isabel
,
seating
herself
,
and
generously
,
*NL*
as
she
thought
,
to
give
him
his
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
at
all
tired
.
Did
you
ever
know
me
to
be
tired
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
;
I
wish
I
had
!
When
did
you
arrive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Last
night
,
very
late
;
in
a
kind
of
snail-train
they
call
the
express
.
*NL*
These
Italian
trains
go
at
about
the
rate
of
an
American
funeral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
in
keeping
--
you
must
have
felt
as
if
you
were
coming
to
bury
*NL*
me
!
''
And
she
forced
a
smile
of
encouragement
to
an
easy
view
of
their
*NL*
situation
.
She
had
reasoned
the
matter
well
out
,
making
it
perfectly
*NL*
clear
that
she
broke
no
faith
and
falsified
no
contract
;
but
for
all
*NL*
this
she
was
afraid
of
her
visitor
.
She
was
ashamed
of
her
fear
;
but
she
*NL*
was
devoutly
thankful
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
ashamed
of
.
He
looked
*NL*
at
her
with
his
stiff
insistence
,
an
insistence
in
which
there
was
such
*NL*
a
want
of
tact
;
especially
when
the
dull
dark
beam
in
his
eye
rested
on
*NL*
her
as
a
physical
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
feel
that
;
I
could
n't
think
of
you
as
dead
.
I
wish
I
*NL*
could
!
''
he
candidly
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
immensely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
think
of
you
as
dead
than
as
married
to
another
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
selfish
of
you
!
''
she
returned
with
the
ardour
of
a
real
*NL*
conviction
.
``
If
you
're
not
happy
yourself
others
have
yet
a
right
to
*NL*
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
it
's
selfish
;
but
I
do
n't
in
the
least
mind
your
saying
so
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
mind
anything
you
can
say
now
--
I
do
n't
feel
it
.
The
cruellest
*NL*
things
you
could
think
of
would
be
mere
pin-pricks
.
After
what
you
've
*NL*
done
I
shall
never
feel
anything
--
I
mean
anything
but
that
.
That
I
shall
*NL*
feel
all
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Goodwood
made
these
detached
assertions
with
dry
deliberateness
,
*NL*
in
his
hard
,
slow
American
tone
,
which
flung
no
atmospheric
colour
over
*NL*
propositions
intrinsically
crude
.
The
tone
made
Isabel
angry
rather
than
*NL*
touched
her
;
but
her
anger
perhaps
was
fortunate
,
inasmuch
as
it
gave
*NL*
her
a
further
reason
for
controlling
herself
.
It
was
under
the
pressure
*NL*
of
this
control
that
she
became
,
after
a
little
,
irrelevant
.
``
When
did
*NL*
you
leave
New
York
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
up
his
head
as
if
calculating
.
``
Seventeen
days
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
travelled
fast
in
spite
of
your
slow
trains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
as
fast
as
I
could
.
I
'd
have
come
five
days
ago
if
I
had
been
*NL*
able
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
n't
have
made
any
difference
,
Mr.
Goodwood
,
''
she
coldly
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
you
--
no
.
But
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
gain
nothing
that
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
for
me
to
judge
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
To
me
it
seems
that
you
only
torment
yourself
.
''
And
then
,
to
*NL*
change
the
subject
,
she
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
Henrietta
Stackpole
.
*NL*
He
looked
as
if
he
had
not
come
from
Boston
to
Florence
to
talk
of
*NL*
Henrietta
Stackpole
;
but
he
answered
,
distinctly
enough
,
that
this
young
*NL*
lady
had
been
with
him
just
before
he
left
America
.
``
She
came
to
see
*NL*
you
?
''
Isabel
then
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
was
in
Boston
,
and
she
called
at
my
office
.
It
was
the
day
I
*NL*
had
got
your
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
tell
her
?
''
Isabel
asked
with
a
certain
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
''
said
Caspar
Goodwood
simply
;
``
I
did
n't
want
to
do
that
.
She
'll
*NL*
hear
it
quick
enough
;
she
hears
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
write
to
her
,
and
then
she
'll
write
to
me
and
scold
me
,
''
Isabel
*NL*
declared
,
trying
to
smile
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caspar
,
however
,
remained
sternly
grave
.
``
I
guess
she
'll
come
right
*NL*
out
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
purpose
to
scold
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
She
seemed
to
think
she
had
not
seen
Europe
thoroughly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
tell
me
that
,
''
Isabel
said
.
``
I
must
prepare
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Goodwood
fixed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
on
the
floor
;
then
at
last
,
*NL*
raising
them
,
``
Does
she
know
Mr.
Osmond
?
''
he
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
.
And
she
does
n't
like
him
.
But
of
course
I
do
n't
marry
to
*NL*
please
Henrietta
,
''
she
added
.
It
would
have
been
better
for
poor
Caspar
*NL*
if
she
had
tried
a
little
more
to
gratify
Miss
Stackpole
;
but
he
did
n't
*NL*
say
so
;
he
only
asked
,
presently
,
when
her
marriage
would
take
place
.
To
*NL*
which
she
made
answer
that
she
did
n't
know
yet
.
``
I
can
only
say
it
will
*NL*
be
soon
.
I
've
told
no
one
but
yourself
and
one
other
person
--
an
old
*NL*
friend
of
Mr.
Osmond
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
marriage
your
friends
wo
n't
like
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
have
n't
an
idea
.
As
I
say
,
I
do
n't
marry
for
my
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
,
making
no
exclamation
,
no
comment
,
only
asking
questions
,
*NL*
doing
it
quite
without
delicacy
.
``
Who
and
what
then
is
Mr.
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
and
what
?
Nobody
and
nothing
but
a
very
good
and
very
honourable
*NL*
man
.
He
's
not
in
business
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
He
's
not
rich
;
he
's
not
known
*NL*
for
anything
in
particular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
disliked
Mr.
Goodwood
's
questions
,
but
she
said
to
herself
that
she
*NL*
owed
it
to
him
to
satisfy
him
as
far
as
possible
.
The
satisfaction
poor
*NL*
Caspar
exhibited
was
,
however
,
small
;
he
sat
very
upright
,
gazing
at
*NL*
her
.
``
Where
does
he
come
from
?
Where
does
he
belong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
never
been
so
little
pleased
with
the
way
he
said
``
belawng
.
''
``
He
*NL*
comes
from
nowhere
.
He
has
spent
most
of
his
life
in
Italy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
in
your
letter

was
American

n't
he
a
native
place

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
he
has
forgotten
it

He
left
it
as
a
small
boy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
never
gone
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
he
go
back
?
''
Isabel
asked
,
flushing
all
defensively
.
``
He
has
*NL*
no
profession

States

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
Italy
and
with
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Goodwood
with
gloomy
plainness
and
*NL*
no
appearance
of
trying
to
make
an
epigram
.
``
What
has
he
ever
done
?
''
he
*NL*
added
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
should
marry
him
?
Nothing
at
all
,
''
Isabel
replied
while
her
*NL*
patience
helped
itself
by
turning
a
little
to
hardness
.
``
If
he
had
done
*NL*
great
things
would
you
forgive
me
any
better
?
Give
me
up
,
Mr.
Goodwood
;
*NL*
I
'm
marrying
a
perfect
nonentity

Do
n't
try
to
take
an
interest
in
him

*NL*
You
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
appreciate
him
;
that
's
what
you
mean

And
you
do
n't
mean
in
*NL*
the
least
that
he
's
a
perfect
nonentity

You
think
he
's
grand
,
you
think
*NL*
he
's
great
,
though
no
one
else
thinks
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
's
colour
deepened
;
she
felt
this
really
acute
of
her
companion
,
*NL*
and
it
was
certainly
a
proof
of
the
aid
that
passion
might
render
*NL*
perceptions
she
had
never
taken
for
fine
.
``
Why
do
you
always
come
back
*NL*
to
what
others
think
?
I
ca
n't
discuss
Mr.
Osmond
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
,
''
said
Caspar
reasonably
.
And
he
sat
there
with
his
air
*NL*
of
stiff
helplessness
,
as
if
not
only
this
were
true
,
but
there
were
*NL*
nothing
else
that
they
might
discuss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
how
little
you
gain

she
accordingly
broke
out
--
``
how
little
*NL*
comfort
or
satisfaction
I
can
give
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did

understand
then
why

*NL*
*NL*

I
came

wanted
to
see
you
once
more

even
just
as
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
appreciate
that
;
but
if
you
had
waited
a
while
,
sooner
or
later
*NL*
we
should
have
been
sure
to
meet
,
and
our
meeting
would
have
been
*NL*
pleasanter
for
each
of
us

this

*NL*
*NL*
``
Waited

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

still
be
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
make
it
all
the
worse

said
Mr.

grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
're
unaccommodating

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
got
up
with
a
movement
of
repressed
impatience
and
walked
to
the
*NL*
window
,
where
she
remained
a
moment
looking
out
.
When
she
turned
round
*NL*
her
visitor
was
still
motionless
in
his
place
.
She
came
toward
him
again
*NL*
and
stopped
,
resting
her
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
she
had
just
*NL*
quitted
.
``
Do
you
mean
you
came
simply
to
look
at
me
?
That
's
better
for
*NL*
you
perhaps
than
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wished
to
hear
the
sound
of
your
voice
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
heard
it
,
and
you
see
it
says
nothing
very
sweet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
gives
me
pleasure
,
all
the
same
.
''
And
with
this
he
got
up
.
She
had
*NL*
felt
pain
and
displeasure
on
receiving
early
that
day
the
news
he
was
in
*NL*
Florence
and
by
her
leave
would
come
within
an
hour
to
see
her
.
She
*NL*
had
been
vexed
and
distressed
,
though
she
had
sent
back
word
by
his
*NL*
messenger
that
he
might
come
when
he
would
.
She
had
not
been
better
*NL*
pleased
when
she
saw
him
;
his
being
there
at
all
was
so
full
of
heavy
*NL*
implications
.
It
implied
things
she
could
never
assent
to
--
rights
,
*NL*
reproaches
,
remonstrance
,
rebuke
,
the
expectation
of
making
her
change
*NL*
her
purpose
.
These
things
,
however
,
if
implied
,
had
not
been
expressed
;
*NL*
and
now
our
young
lady
,
strangely
enough
,
began
to
resent
her
visitor
's
*NL*
remarkable
self-control
.
There
was
a
dumb
misery
about
him
that
*NL*
irritated
her
;
there
was
a
manly
staying
of
his
hand
that
made
her
heart
*NL*
beat
faster
.
She
felt
her
agitation
rising
,
and
she
said
to
herself
*NL*
that
she
was
angry
in
the
way
a
woman
is
angry
when
she
has
been
in
the
*NL*
wrong
.
She
was
not
in
the
wrong
;
she
had
fortunately
not
that
bitterness
*NL*
to
swallow
;
but
,
all
the
same
,
she
wished
he
would
denounce
her
a
*NL*
little
.
She
had
wished
his
visit
would
be
short
;
it
had
no
purpose
,
no
*NL*
propriety
;
yet
now
that
he
seemed
to
be
turning
away
she
felt
a
sudden
*NL*
horror
of
his
leaving
her
without
uttering
a
word
that
would
give
her
an
*NL*
opportunity
to
defend
herself
more
than
she
had
done
in
writing
to
him
*NL*
a
month
before
,
in
a
few
carefully
chosen
words
,
to
announce
her
*NL*
engagement
.
If
she
were
not
in
the
wrong
,
however
,
why
should
she
desire
*NL*
to
defend
herself
?
It
was
an
excess
of
generosity
on
Isabel
's
part
to
*NL*
desire
that
Mr.
Goodwood
should
be
angry
.
And
if
he
had
not
meanwhile
*NL*
held
himself
hard
it
might
have
made
him
so
to
hear
the
tone
in
which
*NL*
she
suddenly
exclaimed
,
as
if
she
were
accusing
him
of
having
accused
*NL*
her
:
``
I
've
not
deceived
you
!
I
was
perfectly
free
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
that
,
''
said
Caspar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
you
full
warning
that
I
'd
do
as
I
chose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
you
'd
probably
never
marry
,
and
you
said
it
with
such
a
manner
*NL*
that
I
pretty
well
believed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
considered
this
an
instant
.
``
No
one
can
be
more
surprised
than
*NL*
myself
at
my
present
intention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
me
that
if
I
heard
you
were
engaged
I
was
not
to
believe
*NL*
it
,
''
Caspar
went
on
.
``
I
heard
it
twenty
days
ago
from
yourself
,
but
I
*NL*
remembered
what
you
had
said
.
I
thought
there
might
be
some
mistake
,
and
*NL*
that
's
partly
why
I
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
wish
me
to
repeat
it
by
word
of
mouth
,
that
's
soon
done
.
There
's
*NL*
no
mistake
whatever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
that
as
soon
as
I
came
into
the
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
good
would
it
do
you
that
I
should
n't
marry
?
''
she
asked
with
a
*NL*
certain
fierceness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
it
better
than
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
selfish
,
as
I
said
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
.
I
'm
selfish
as
iron
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
iron
sometimes
melts
!
If
you
'll
be
reasonable
I
'll
see
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
call
me
reasonable
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
you
,
''
she
answered
with
sudden
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
trouble
you
for
a
long
time
,
''
the
young
man
went
on
.
He
made
*NL*
a
step
towards
the
door
,
but
he
stopped
.
``
Another
reason
why
I
came
was
*NL*
that
I
wanted
to
hear
what
you
would
say
in
explanation
of
your
having
*NL*
changed
your
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
humbleness
as
suddenly
deserted
her
.
``
In
explanation
?
Do
you
think
*NL*
I
'm
bound
to
explain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
one
of
his
long
dumb
looks
.
``
You
were
very
positive
.
I
did
*NL*
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
did
I.
Do
you
think
I
could
explain
if
I
would
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
suppose
not
.
Well
,
''
he
added
,
``
I
've
done
what
I
wished
.
I
've
seen
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
little
you
make
of
these
terrible
journeys
,
''
she
felt
the
poverty
*NL*
of
her
presently
replying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
're
afraid
I
'm
knocked
up
--
in
any
such
way
as
that

you
may
be
*NL*
at
your
ease
about
it

''
He
turned
away
,
this
time
in
earnest
,
and
no
*NL*
hand-shake
,
no
sign
of
parting
,
was
exchanged
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
door
he
stopped
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
.
``
I
shall
leave
*NL*
Florence
to-morrow
,
''
he
said
without
a
quaver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
delighted
to
hear
it
!

she
answered
passionately

Five
minutes

after
he
had
gone
out
she
burst
into
tears

CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
Her
fit
of
weeping
,
however
,
was
soon
smothered
,
and
the
signs
of
it
had
*NL*
vanished
when
,
an
hour
later
,
she
broke
the
news
to
her
aunt
.
I
use
this
*NL*
expression
because
she
had
been
sure
Mrs.
Touchett
would
not
be
pleased
;
*NL*
Isabel
had
only
waited
to
tell
her
till
she
had
seen
Mr.
Goodwood
.
She
*NL*
had
an
odd
impression
that
it
would
not
be
honourable
to
make
the
fact
*NL*
public
before
she
should
have
heard
what
Mr.
Goodwood
would
say
about
*NL*
it
.
He
had
said
rather
less
than
she
expected
,
and
she
now
had
a
*NL*
somewhat
angry
sense
of
having
lost
time
.
But
she
would
lose
no
more
;
*NL*
she
waited
till
Mrs.
Touchett
came
into
the
drawing-room
before
the
*NL*
mid-day
breakfast
,
and
then
she
began
.
``
Aunt
Lydia
,
I
've
something
to
*NL*
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
gave
a
little
jump
and
looked
at
her
almost
fiercely
.
``
You
*NL*
need
n't
tell
me
;
I
know
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
you
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
way
that
I
know
when
the
window
's
open

by
feeling
a
draught

You
're
going
to
marry
that
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
man
do
you
mean

Isabel
enquired
with
great
dignity
.

*NL*
``
Madame
Merle
's
friend

Mr.
Osmond

*NL*
``
I
do
n't

principal
thing

's
known
by
?

*NL*
*NL*
``

him

cried
Mrs.
Touchett
.
``
I
should
n't
have
expected
it
of
her

I
'm
*NL*
disappointed

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
mean
that
Madame
Merle
has
had
anything
to
do

my
engagement

're
greatly
mistaken

Isabel
declared
with
a
sort
of
ardent
*NL*
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
your
attractions
were
sufficient

gentleman

had

lashed
up

You
're
quite
right

They

immense

attractions

he
would
never
have
presumed
to

n't
put
him
up
to
it

He
has
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself

he
*NL*
was
not
a
man
to
take
trouble

Madame

took
the
trouble

*NL*
``
He
has
taken

deal

cried
Isabel
with
a
voluntary
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
gave
a
sharp
nod
.
``
I
think

must

all

made
you

``

the

*NL*
``

Mrs.

explained

Isabel
asked

they
give
some
*NL*
other
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
hesitated
a
little
.
``
I
think
I
value
everything
that
's
valuable
.
*NL*
I
care
very
much
for
money
,
and
that
's
why
I
wish
Mr.
Osmond
to
have
a
*NL*
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
him
then
;
but
marry
some
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
name
's
good
enough
for
me
,
''
the
girl
went
on
.
``
It
's
a
very
pretty
*NL*
name
.
Have
I
such
a
fine
one
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
more
reason
you
should
improve
on
it
.
There
are
only
a
dozen
*NL*
American
names

Do
you
marry
him
out
of
charity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
duty
to
tell
you

Lydia

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*

It

said
Mrs.
Touchett

Madame
Merle

*NL*
``
I

*NL*
``

play
any
part

I
understood
that
she
played

*NL*
``
I
do

;
*NL*
``

been
honest

kind

devoted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Devoted

of
course

wished
you

me

watching
you
only
in
order
to
interpose

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
that
to

the
girl
answered
;
conscious
,
however
,
of
*NL*
the
inadequacy
of
the
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
please
me

deceiving
me

I
pleased

to-day

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
you
're
ever
much
pleased

Isabel
was
obliged
to
reply
.
*NL*
``
If
Madame
Merle
knew
you
would
learn
the
truth
what
had
she
to
gain
by
*NL*
insincerity
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
gained
time
,
as
you
see

While
I
waited
for
her
to
interfere
you
*NL*
were
marching
away
,
and
she
was
really
beating
the
drum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
well
.
But
by
your
own
admission
you
saw
I
was
marching
,
and
*NL*
even
if
she
had
given
the
alarm
you
would
n't
have
tried
to
stop
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
some
one
else
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
mean
?
''
Isabel
asked
,
looking
very
hard
at
her
aunt
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
's
little
bright
eyes
,
active
as
they
usually
were
,
sustained
*NL*
her
gaze
rather
than
returned
it
.
``
Would
you
have
listened
to
Ralph
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
he
had
abused
Mr.
Osmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ralph
does
n't
abuse
people
;
you
know
that
perfectly
.
He
cares
very
much
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
he
does
,
''
said
Isabel
;
``
and
I
shall
feel
the
value
of
it
now
,
*NL*
for
he
knows
that
whatever
I
do
I
do
with
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
believed
you
would
do
this
.
I
told
him
you
were
capable
of
it
,
*NL*
and
he
argued
the
other
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
it
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
''
the
girl
smiled
.
``
You
do
n't
accuse
*NL*
him
of
having
deceived
you
;
why
should
you
accuse
Madame
Merle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
pretended
he
'd
prevent
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
of
that
!
''
cried
Isabel
gaily
.
``
I
wish
very
much
,
''
she
*NL*
presently
added
,
``
that
when
he
comes
you
'd
tell
him
first
of
my
*NL*
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
'll
mention
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
.
``
I
shall
say
nothing
*NL*
more
to
you
about
it
,
but
I
give
you
notice
I
shall
talk
to
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
as
you
please
.
I
only
meant
that
it
's
rather
better
the
*NL*
announcement
should
come
from
you
than
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
agree
with
you
;
it
's
much
more
proper
!
''
And
on
this
the
aunt
*NL*
and
the
niece
went
to
breakfast
,
where
Mrs.
Touchett
,
as
good
as
her
*NL*
word
,
made
no
allusion
to
Gilbert
Osmond
.
After
an
interval
of
silence
,
*NL*
however
,
she
asked
her
companion
from
whom
she
had
received
a
visit
an
*NL*
hour
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
an
old
friend
--
an
American
gentleman
,
''
Isabel
said
with
a
colour
*NL*
in
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
American
gentleman
of
course
.
It
's
only
an
American
gentleman
who
*NL*
calls
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
half-past
ten
;
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
;
he
goes
away
this
*NL*
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
he
have
come
yesterday
,
at
the
usual
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
only
arrived
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
spends
but
twenty-four
hours
in
Florence
?
''
Mrs.
Touchett
cried
.
*NL*
``
He
's
an
American
gentleman
truly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
indeed
,
''
said
Isabel
,
thinking
with
perverse
admiration
of
what
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
had
done
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
afterward
Ralph
arrived
;
but
though
Isabel
was
sure
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
had
lost
no
time
in
imparting
to
him
the
great
fact
,
he
showed
*NL*
at
first
no
open
knowledge
of
it
.
Their
prompted
talk
was
naturally
of
*NL*
his
health
;
Isabel
had
many
questions
to
ask
about
Corfu
.
She
had
been
*NL*
shocked
by
his
appearance
when
he
came
into
the
room
;
she
had
forgotten
*NL*
how
ill
he
looked
.
In
spite
of
Corfu
he
looked
very
ill
to-day
,
and
she
*NL*
wondered
if
he
were
really
worse
or
if
she
were
simply
disaccustomed
*NL*
to
living
with
an
invalid
.
Poor
Ralph
made
no
nearer
approach
to
*NL*
conventional
beauty
as
he
advanced
in
life
,
and
the
now
apparently
*NL*
complete
loss
of
his
health
had
done
little
to
mitigate
the
natural
*NL*
oddity
of
his
person
.
Blighted
and
battered
,
but
still
responsive
and
*NL*
still
ironic
,
his
face
was
like
a
lighted
lantern
patched
with
paper
*NL*
and
unsteadily
held
;
his
thin
whisker
languished
upon
a
lean
cheek
;
the
*NL*
exorbitant
curve
of
his
nose
defined
itself
more
sharply
.
Lean
he
was
*NL*
altogether
,
lean
and
long
and
loose-jointed
;
an
accidental
cohesion
of
*NL*
relaxed
angles
.
His
brown
velvet
jacket
had
become
perennial
;
his
*NL*
hands
had
fixed
themselves
in
his
pockets
;
he
shambled
and
stumbled
and
*NL*
shuffled
in
a
manner
that
denoted
great
physical
helplessness
.
It
was
*NL*
perhaps
this
whimsical
gait
that
helped
to
mark
his
character
more
than
*NL*
ever
as
that
of
the
humorous
invalid
--
the
invalid
for
whom
even
his
own
*NL*
disabilities
are
part
of
the
general
joke
.
They
might
well
indeed
with
*NL*
Ralph
have
been
the
chief
cause
of
the
want
of
seriousness
marking
his
*NL*
view
of
a
world
in
which
the
reason
for
his
own
continued
presence
was
*NL*
past
finding
out
.
Isabel
had
grown
fond
of
his
ugliness
;
his
awkwardness
*NL*
had
become
dear
to
her
.
They
had
been
sweetened
by
association
;
they
*NL*
struck
her
as
the
very
terms
on
which
it
had
been
given
him
to
be
*NL*
charming
.
He
was
so
charming
that
her
sense
of
his
being
ill
had
*NL*
hitherto
had
a
sort
of
comfort
in
it
;
the
state
of
his
health
had
seemed
*NL*
not
a
limitation
,
but
a
kind
of
intellectual
advantage
;
it
absolved
him
*NL*
from
all
professional
and
official
emotions
and
left
him
the
luxury
of
*NL*
being
exclusively
personal
.
The
personality
so
resulting
was
delightful
;
*NL*
he
had
remained
proof
against
the
staleness
of
disease
;
he
had
had
to
*NL*
consent
to
be
deplorably
ill
,
yet
had
somehow
escaped
being
formally
*NL*
sick
.
Such
had
been
the
girl
's
impression
of
her
cousin
;
and
when
she
*NL*
had
pitied
him
it
was
only
on
reflection
.
As
she
reflected
a
good
deal
*NL*
she
had
allowed
him
a
certain
amount
of
compassion
;
but
she
always
had
*NL*
a
dread
of
wasting
that
essence
--
a
precious
article
,
worth
more
to
the
*NL*
giver
than
to
any
one
else
.
Now
,
however
,
it
took
no
great
sensibility
*NL*
to
feel
that
poor
Ralph
's
tenure
of
life
was
less
elastic
than
it
should
*NL*
be
.
He
was
a
bright
,
free
,
generous
spirit
,
he
had
all
the
illumination
*NL*
of
wisdom
and
none
of
its
pedantry
,
and
yet
he
was
distressfully
dying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
noted
afresh
that
life
was
certainly
hard
for
some
people
,
*NL*
and
she
felt
a
delicate
glow
of
shame
as
she
thought
how
easy
it
now
*NL*
promised
to
become
for
herself
.
She
was
prepared
to
learn
that
Ralph
was
*NL*
not
pleased
with
her
engagement
;
but
she
was
not
prepared
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
her
affection
for
him
,
to
let
this
fact
spoil
the
situation
.
She
was
not
*NL*
even
prepared
,
or
so
she
thought
,
to
resent
his
want
of
sympathy
;
for
*NL*
it
would
be
his
privilege
--
it
would
be
indeed
his
natural
line
--
to
find
*NL*
fault
with
any
step
she
might
take
toward
marriage
.
One
's
cousin
always
*NL*
pretended
to
hate
one
's
husband
;
that
was
traditional
,
classical
;
it
*NL*
was
a
part
of
one
's
cousin
's
always
pretending
to
adore
one
.
Ralph
was
*NL*
nothing
if
not
critical
;
and
though
she
would
certainly
,
other
things
*NL*
being
equal
,
have
been
as
glad
to
marry
to
please
him
as
to
please
any
*NL*
one
,
it
would
be
absurd
to
regard
as
important
that
her
choice
should
*NL*
square
with
his
views
.
What
were
his
views
after
all
?
He
had
pretended
*NL*
to
believe
she
had
better
have
married
Lord
Warburton
;
but
this
was
*NL*
only
because
she
had
refused
that
excellent
man
.
If
she
had
accepted
*NL*
him
Ralph
would
certainly
have
taken
another
tone
;
he
always
took
the
*NL*
opposite
.
You
could
criticise
any
marriage
;
it
was
the
essence
of
a
*NL*
marriage
to
be
open
to
criticism
.
How
well
she
herself
,
should
she
only
*NL*
give
her
mind
to
it
,
might
criticise
this
union
of
her
own
!
She
had
*NL*
other
employment
,
however
,
and
Ralph
was
welcome
to
relieve
her
of
the
*NL*
care
.
Isabel
was
prepared
to
be
most
patient
and
most
indulgent
.
He
must
*NL*
have
seen
that
,
and
this
made
it
the
more
odd
he
should
say
nothing
.
*NL*
After
three
days
had
elapsed
without
his
speaking
our
young
woman
*NL*
wearied
of
waiting
;
dislike
it
as
he
would
,
he
might
at
least
go
through
*NL*
the
form
.
We
,
who
know
more
about
poor
Ralph
than
his
cousin
,
may
easily
*NL*
believe
that
during
the
hours
that
followed
his
arrival
at
Palazzo
*NL*
Crescentini
he
had
privately
gone
through
many
forms
.
His
mother
had
*NL*
literally
greeted
him
with
the
great
news
,
which
had
been
even
more
*NL*
sensibly
chilling
than
Mrs.
Touchett
's
maternal
kiss
.
Ralph
was
shocked
*NL*
and
humiliated
;
his
calculations
had
been
false
and
the
person
in
the
*NL*
world
in
whom
he
was
most
interested
was
lost
.
He
drifted
about
the
*NL*
house
like
a
rudderless
vessel
in
a
rocky
stream
,
or
sat
in
the
garden
*NL*
of
the
palace
on
a
great
cane
chair
,
his
long
legs
extended
,
his
head
*NL*
thrown
back
and
his
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
.
He
felt
cold
about
the
*NL*
heart
;
he
had
never
liked
anything
less
.
What
could
he
do
,
what
could
*NL*
he
say
?
If
the
girl
were
irreclaimable
could
he
pretend
to
like
it
?
*NL*
To
attempt
to
reclaim
her
was
permissible
only
if
the
attempt
should
*NL*
succeed
.
To
try
to
persuade
her
of
anything
sordid
or
sinister
in
the
*NL*
man
to
whose
deep
art
she
had
succumbed
would
be
decently
discreet
only
*NL*
in
the
event
of
her
being
persuaded
.
Otherwise
he
should
simply
have
*NL*
damned
himself
.
It
cost
him
an
equal
effort
to
speak
his
thought
and
to
*NL*
dissemble
;
he
could
neither
assent
with
sincerity
nor
protest
with
hope
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
he
knew
--
or
rather
he
supposed
--
that
the
affianced
pair
were
*NL*
daily
renewing
their
mutual
vows
.
Osmond
at
this
moment
showed
himself
*NL*
little
at
Palazzo
Crescentini
;
but
Isabel
met
him
every
day
elsewhere
,
*NL*
as
she
was
free
to
do
after
their
engagement
had
been
made
public
.
She
*NL*
had
taken
a
carriage
by
the
month
,
so
as
not
to
be
indebted
to
her
aunt
*NL*
for
the

pursuing
a
course
of
which
Mrs.
Touchett
disapproved
,
*NL*
and
she
drove
in
the
morning
to
the
Cascine
.
This
suburban
wilderness
,
*NL*
during
the
early
hours
,
was
void
of
all
intruders
,
and
our
young
lady
,
*NL*
joined
by
her
lover
in
its
quietest
part
,
strolled
with
him
a
while

through
the
grey
Italian
shade

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
on
her
return
from
her
drive
,
some
half-hour
before
*NL*
luncheon
,
she
quitted
her
vehicle
in
the
court
of
the
palace
and
,
*NL*
instead
of
ascending
the
great
staircase
,
crossed
the
court
,
passed
*NL*
beneath
another
archway
and
entered
the
garden
.
A
sweeter
spot
at
this
*NL*
moment
could
not
have
been
imagined
.
The
stillness
of
noontide
hung
over
*NL*
it
,
and
the
warm
shade
,
enclosed
and
still
,
made
bowers
like
spacious
*NL*
caves
.
Ralph
was
sitting
there
in
the
clear
gloom
,
at
the
base
of
a
*NL*
statue
of
Terpsichore
--
a
dancing
nymph
with
taper
fingers
and
inflated
*NL*
draperies
in
the
manner
of
Bernini
;
the
extreme
relaxation
of
his
*NL*
attitude
suggested
at
first
to
Isabel
that
he
was
asleep
.
Her
light
*NL*
footstep
on
the
grass
had
not
roused
him
,
and
before
turning
away
she
*NL*
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
him
.
During
this
instant
he
opened
his
*NL*
eyes
;
upon
which
she
sat
down
on
a
rustic
chair
that
matched
with
his
*NL*
own
.
Though
in
her
irritation
she
had
accused
him
of
indifference
she
*NL*
was
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
he
had
visibly
had
something
to
brood
*NL*
over
.
But
she
had
explained
his
air
of
absence
partly
by
the
languor
of
*NL*
his
increased
weakness
,
partly
by
worries
connected
with
the
property
*NL*
inherited
from
his
father
--
the
fruit
of
eccentric
arrangements
of
*NL*
which
Mrs.
Touchett
disapproved
and
which
,
as
she
had
told
Isabel
,
now
*NL*
encountered
opposition
from
the
other
partners
in
the
bank
.
He
ought
to
*NL*
have
gone
to
England
,
his
mother
said
,
instead
of
coming
to
Florence
;
*NL*
he
had
not
been
there
for
months
,
and
took
no
more
interest
in
the
bank
*NL*
than
in
the
state
of
Patagonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
I
waked
you
,
''
Isabel
said
;
``
you
look
too
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
too
tired
.
But
I
was
not
asleep
.
I
was
thinking
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
tired
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
so
.
It
leads
to
nothing
.
The
road
's
long
and
I
never
arrive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
wish
to
arrive
at
?
''
she
put
to
him
,
closing
her
parasol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
point
of
expressing
to
myself
properly
what
I
think
of
your
*NL*
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
too
much
of
it
,
''
she
lightly
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
that
it
's
none
of
my
business
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beyond
a
certain
point
,
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
point
I
want
to
fix
.
I
had
an
idea
you
may
have
found
me
*NL*
wanting
in
good
manners
.
I
've
never
congratulated
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
've
noticed
that
.
I
wondered
why
you
were
silent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
have
been
a
good
many
reasons
.
I
'll
tell
you
now
,
''
Ralph
said
.
*NL*
He
pulled
off
his
hat
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
;
then
he
sat
looking
at
*NL*
her
.
He
leaned
back
under
the
protection
of
Bernini
,
his
head
against
*NL*
his
marble
pedestal
,
his
arms
dropped
on
either
side
of
him
,
his
hands
*NL*
laid
upon
the
rests
of
his
wide
chair
.
He
looked
awkward
,
uncomfortable
;
*NL*
he
hesitated
long
.
Isabel
said
nothing
;
when
people
were
embarrassed
she
*NL*
was
usually
sorry
for
them
,
but
she
was
determined
not
to
help
Ralph
to
*NL*
utter
a
word
that
should
not
be
to
the
honour
of
her
high
decision
.
``
I
*NL*
think
I
've
hardly
got
over
my
surprise
,
''
he
went
on
at
last
.
``
You
were
*NL*
the
last
person
I
expected
to
see
caught
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
why
you
call
it
caught
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
're
going
to
be
put
into
a
cage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
like
my
cage
,
that
need
n't
trouble
you
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
wonder
at
;
that
's
what
I
've
been
thinking
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
've
been
thinking
you
may
imagine
how
I
've
thought
!
I
'm
satisfied
*NL*
that
I
'm
doing
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
changed
immensely
.
A
year
ago
you
valued
your
liberty
*NL*
beyond
everything
.
You
wanted
only
to
see
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
it
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
It
does
n't
look
to
me
now
,
I
admit
,
such
*NL*
an
inviting
expanse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
pretend
it
is
;
only
I
had
an
idea
that
you
took
a
genial
view
*NL*
of
it
and
wanted
to
survey
the
whole
field
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
that
one
ca
n't
do
anything
so
general
.
One
must
choose
a
*NL*
corner
and
cultivate
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
think
.
And
one
must
choose
as
good
a
corner
as
possible

*NL*
I
had
no
idea
,
all
winter
,
while
I
read
your
delightful
letters
,
that
*NL*
you
were
choosing
.
You
said
nothing
about
it
,
and
your
silence
put
me
*NL*
off
my
guard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
a
matter
I
was
likely
to
write
to
you
about
.
Besides
,
I
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
the
future
.
It
has
all
come
lately
.
If
you
had
been
on
your
*NL*
guard
,
however
,
''
Isabel
asked
,
``
what
would
you
have
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
said
`
Wait
a
little
longer

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
for
a
little
more
light
,
''
said
Ralph
with
rather
an
absurd
smile
,
*NL*
while
his
hands
found
their
way
into
his
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
should
my
light
have
come
from
?
From
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
have
struck
a
spark
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
had
drawn
off
her
gloves
;
she
smoothed
them
out
as
they
lay
*NL*
upon
her
knee
.
The
mildness
of
this
movement
was
accidental
,
for
her
*NL*
expression
was
not
conciliatory
.
``
You
're
beating
about
the
bush
,
Ralph
.
*NL*
You
wish
to
say
you
do
n't
like
Mr.
Osmond
,
and
yet
you
're
afraid

*NL*
*NL*
``
Willing
to
wound

yet
afraid
to
strike

I
'm
willing
to
wound
HIM
,
*NL*
yes
--
but
not
to
wound
you
.
I
'm
afraid
of
you
,
not
of
him
.
If
you
marry
*NL*
him
it
wo
n't
be
a
fortunate
way
for
me
to
have
spoken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
IF
I
marry
him
!
Have
you
had
any
expectation
of
dissuading
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
that
seems
to
you
too
fatuous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Isabel
after
a
little
;
``
it
seems
to
me
too
touching
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
same
thing
.
It
makes
me
so
ridiculous
that
you
pity
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stroked
out
her
long
gloves
again
.
``
I
know
you
've
a
great
affection
*NL*
for
me
.
I
ca
n't
get
rid
of
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
heaven

sake

intensely
I
want
you
to
do
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
little
you
trust

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
;
the
warm
noontide
seemed
to
listen
.
``
I
*NL*
trust
you
,
but
I
do
n't
trust
him
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
eyes
and
gave
him
a
wide
,
deep
look
.
``
You
've
said
it
now
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
glad
you
've
made
it
so
clear
.
But
you
'll
suffer
by
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
you
're
just
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
just
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
What
better
proof
of
it
can
there
be
than
*NL*
that
I
'm
not
angry
with
you
?
I
do
n't
know
what
's
the
matter
with
me
,
but
*NL*
I
'm
not
.
I
was
when
you
began
,
but
it
has
passed
away
.
Perhaps
I
ought
*NL*
to
be
angry
,
but
Mr.
Osmond
would
n't
think
so
.
He
wants
me
to
know
*NL*
everything
;
that
's
what
I
like
him
for
.
You
've
nothing
to
gain
,
I
know
*NL*
that

I
've
never
been
so
nice
to
you
,
as
a
girl
,
that
you
should
have
*NL*
much
reason
for
wishing
me
to
remain
one

You
give
very
good
advice
;
*NL*
you
've
often
done
so

No

I
'm
very
quiet
;
I
've
always
believed
in
your

wisdom

''
she
went
on
,
boasting
of
her
quietness
,
yet
speaking
with
a
*NL*
kind
of
contained
exaltation
.
It
was
her
passionate
desire
to
be
*NL*
just
;
it
touched
Ralph
to
the
heart
,
affected
him
like
a
caress
from
a
*NL*
creature
he
had
injured
.
He
wished
to
interrupt
,
to
reassure
her
;
for
a
*NL*
moment
he
was
absurdly
inconsistent
;
he
would
have
retracted
what
he
had
*NL*
said
.
But
she
gave
him
no
chance
;
she
went
on
,
having
caught
a
glimpse
,
*NL*
as
she
thought
,
of
the
heroic
line
and
desiring
to
advance
in
that
*NL*
direction
.
``
I
see
you
've
some
special
idea
;
I
should
like
very
much
to
*NL*
hear
it
.
I
'm
sure
it
's
disinterested
;
I
feel
that
.
It
seems
a
strange
*NL*
thing
to
argue
about
,
and
of
course
I
ought
to
tell
you
definitely
that
*NL*
if
you
expect
to
dissuade
me
you
may
give
it
up

You
'll
not
move
me
*NL*
an
inch
;
it
's
too
late
.
As
you
say
,
I
'm
caught
.
Certainly
it
wo
n't
be
*NL*
pleasant
for
you
to
remember
this
,
but
your
pain
will
be
in
your
own
*NL*
thoughts

I
shall
never
reproach
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

Ralph

sort

marriage

thought
you

*NL*
``
What
sort
of
marriage
was
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
can
hardly
say

I
had

exactly
a
positive
view

I

had
a
negative

I
did

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

independent

so
individual

what
I
most
see
in

the
girl
*NL*
declared
.
``
What

Yes

Ralph
said
,
``
I
know

very
little

I
confess

facts

items

villain

all
the

*NL*
``

out

would

*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
reclined
in
her
chair
,
folding
her
arms
and
gazing
a
while
at
her
*NL*
cousin
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
understand
you
,
''
she
said
at
last
coldly
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talking
about

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believed

*NL*
*NL*
Cold
,
I
say
,
her
tone
had
been
,
but
at
this
a
colour
like
a
flame
leaped
*NL*
into
her
face
.
``
Of
more
importance
to
whom

It
seems
to
me
enough
that
*NL*
one

husband
should
be
of
importance
to
one
's
self

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
blushed
as
well
;
his
attitude
embarrassed
him
.
Physically
speaking
*NL*
he
proceeded
to
change
it
;
he
straightened
himself
,
then
leaned
forward
,
*NL*
resting
a
hand
on
each
knee
.
He
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
ground
;
he
had
an
*NL*
air
of
the
most
respectful
deliberation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
in
a
moment
what
I
mean
,
''
he
presently
said
.
He
felt
*NL*
agitated
,
intensely
eager
;
now
that
he
had
opened
the
discussion
he
*NL*
wished
to
discharge
his
mind
.
But
he
wished
also
to
be
superlatively
*NL*
gentle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
waited
a
little
--
then
she
went
on
with
majesty
.
``
In
everything
*NL*
that
makes
one
care
for
people
Mr.
Osmond
is
pre-eminent

There
may
*NL*
be
nobler
natures

I
've
never
had
the
pleasure

meeting
one

Mr.

the
finest
I
know

he
's
good
enough
for

interesting
*NL*
enough

clever
enough

I

far
more
struck
with
what

what
*NL*
he
represents
than
with
what
he
may
lack

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
treated
myself
to
a
charming
vision
of
your
future

Ralph
*NL*
observed
without
answering
this
;
``
I
had
amused
myself
with
planning
out

.
There
was
to
be
nothing
of
this
sort
in
it
.
You
*NL*
were
not
to
come
down
so
easily
or
so
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
down
,
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
renders
my
sense
of
what
has
happened
to
you
.
You
seemed
to
*NL*
me
to
be
soaring
far
up
in
the
blue
--
to
be
,
sailing
in
the
bright
light
,
*NL*
over
the
heads
of
men
.
Suddenly
some
one
tosses
up
a
faded
rosebud
--
a
*NL*
missile
that
should
never
have
reached
you
--
and
straight
you
drop
to
*NL*
the
ground
.
It
hurts
me
,
''
said
Ralph
audaciously
,
``
hurts
me
as
if
I
had
*NL*
fallen
myself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
look
of
pain
and
bewilderment
deepened
in
his
companion
's
face
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
understand
you
in
the
least
,
''
she
repeated
.
``
You
say
you
amused
*NL*
yourself
with
a
project
for
my
career
--
I
do
n't
understand
that
.
*NL*
Do
n't
amuse
yourself
too
much
,
or
I
shall
think
you
're
doing
it
at
my
*NL*
expense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
shook
his
head
.
``
I
'm
not
afraid
of
your
not
believing
that
I
've
*NL*
had
great
ideas
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
my
soaring
and
sailing
?
''
she
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
moved
on
a
higher
plane
than
I
'm
moving
on
now
.
There
's
*NL*
nothing
higher
for
a
girl
than
to
marry
a
--
a
person
she
likes
,
''
said
*NL*
poor
Isabel
,
wandering
into
the
didactic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
your
liking
the
person
we
speak
of
that
I
venture
to
criticise
,
my
*NL*
dear
cousin
.
I
should
have
said
that
the
man
for
you
would
have
been
a
*NL*
more
active
,
larger
,
freer
sort
of
nature
.
''
Ralph
hesitated
,
then
added
:
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
get
over
the
sense
that
Osmond
is
somehow
--
well
,
small
.
''
He
had
*NL*
uttered
the
last
word
with
no
great
assurance
;
he
was
afraid
she
would
*NL*
flash
out
again
.
But
to
his
surprise
she
was
quiet
;
she
had
the
air
of
*NL*
considering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Small
?
''
She
made
it
sound
immense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
's
narrow
,
selfish
.
He
takes
himself
so
seriously
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
a
great
respect
for
himself
;
I
do
n't
blame
him
for
that
,
''
said
*NL*
Isabel
.
``
It
makes
one
more
sure
to
respect
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
for
a
moment
felt
almost
reassured
by
her
reasonable
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
everything
is
relative
;
one
ought
to
feel
one
's
relation
to
*NL*
things
--
to
others
.
I
do
n't
think
Mr.
Osmond
does
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
chiefly
to
do
with
his
relation
to
me
.
In
that
he
's
excellent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
the
incarnation
of
taste
,
''
Ralph
went
on
,
thinking
hard
how
he
*NL*
could
best
express
Gilbert
Osmond
's
sinister
attributes
without
putting
*NL*
himself
in
the
wrong
by
seeming
to
describe
him
coarsely
.
He
wished
*NL*
to
describe
him
impersonally
,
scientifically
.
``
He
judges
and
measures
,
*NL*
approves
and
condemns
,
altogether
by
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
happy
thing
then
that
his
taste
should
be
exquisite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
exquisite
,
indeed
,
since
it
has
led
him
to
select
you
as
*NL*
his
bride
.
But
have
you
ever
seen
such
a
taste
--
a
really
exquisite
*NL*
one
--
ruffled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
may
never
be
my
fortune
to
fail
to
gratify
my
husband
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
a
sudden
passion
leaped
to
Ralph
's
lips
.
``
Ah
,
that
's
*NL*
wilful
,
that
's
unworthy
of
you
!
You
were
not
meant
to
be
measured
in
*NL*
that
way
--
you
were
meant
for
something
better
than
to
keep
guard
over
*NL*
the
sensibilities
of
a
sterile
dilettante
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
rose
quickly
and
he
did
the
same
,
so
that
they
stood
for
a
moment
*NL*
looking
at
each
other
as
if
he
had
flung
down
a
defiance
or
an
insult
.
*NL*
But
``
You
go
too
far
,
''
she
simply
breathed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
said
what
I
had
on
my
mind
--
and
I
've
said
it
because
I
love
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
turned
pale
:
was
he
too
on
that
tiresome
list
?
She
had
a
sudden
*NL*
wish
to
strike
him
off
.
``
Ah
then
,
you
're
not
disinterested
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
,
but
I
love
without
hope
,
''
said
Ralph
quickly
,
forcing
a
*NL*
smile
and
feeling
that
in
that
last
declaration
he
had
expressed
more
*NL*
than
he
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
moved
away
and
stood
looking
into
the
sunny
stillness
of
the
*NL*
garden
;
but
after
a
little
she
turned
back
to
him
.
``
I
'm
afraid
your
talk
*NL*
then
is
the
wildness
of
despair
!
I
do
n't
understand
it
--
but
it
does
n't
*NL*
matter
.
I
'm
not
arguing
with
you
;
it
's
impossible
I
should
;
I
've
only
*NL*
tried
to
listen
to
you
.
I
'm
much
obliged
to
you
for
attempting
to
*NL*
explain
,
''
she
said
gently
,
as
if
the
anger
with
which
she
had
just
*NL*
sprung
up
had
already
subsided
.
``
It
's
very
good
of
you
to
try
to
warn
*NL*
me
,
if
you
're
really
alarmed
;
but
I
wo
n't
promise
to
think
of
what
*NL*
you
've
said
:
I
shall
forget
it
as
soon
as
possible
.
Try
and
forget
it
*NL*
yourself
;
you
've
done
your
duty
,
and
no
man
can
do
more
.
I
ca
n't
explain
*NL*
to
you
what
I
feel
,
what
I
believe
,
and
I
would
n't
if
I
could
.
''
She
*NL*
paused
a
moment
and
then
went
on
with
an
inconsequence
that
Ralph
*NL*
observed
even
in
the
midst
of
his
eagerness
to
discover
some
symptom
of
*NL*
concession
.
``
I
ca
n't
enter
into
your
idea
of
Mr.
Osmond
;
I
ca
n't
do
it
*NL*
justice
,
because
I
see
him
in
quite
another
way
.
He
's
not
important
--
no
,
*NL*
he
's
not
important
;
he
's
a
man
to
whom
importance
is
supremely
*NL*
indifferent
.
If
that
's
what
you
mean
when
you
call
him
`
small
,
'
then
*NL*
he
's
as
small
as
you
please
.
I
call
that
large
--
it
's
the
largest
thing
*NL*
I
know
.
I
wo
n't
pretend
to
argue
with
you
about
a
person
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
marry
,
''
Isabel
repeated
.
``
I
'm
not
in
the
least
concerned
to
defend
Mr.
*NL*
Osmond
;
he
's
not
so
weak
as
to
need
my
defence
.
I
should
think
it
would
*NL*
seem
strange
even
to
yourself
that
I
should
talk
of
him
so
quietly
and
*NL*
coldly
,
as
if
he
were
any
one
else
.
I
would
n't
talk
of
him
at
all
to
any
*NL*
one
but
you
;
and
you
,
after
what
you
've
said
--
I
may
just
answer
you
once
*NL*
for
all
.
Pray
,
would
you
wish
me
to
make
a
mercenary
marriage
--
what
*NL*
they
call
a
marriage
of
ambition
?
I
've
only
one
ambition
--
to
be
free
to
*NL*
follow
out
a
good
feeling
.
I
had
others
once
,
but
they
've
passed
away
.
*NL*
Do
you
complain
of
Mr.
Osmond
because
he
's
not
rich
?
That
's
just
what
I
*NL*
like
him
for
.
I
've
fortunately
money
enough
;
I
've
never
felt
so
thankful
*NL*
for
it
as
to-day
.
There
have
been
moments
when
I
should
like
to
go
and
*NL*
kneel
down
by
your
father
's
grave
:
he
did
perhaps
a
better
thing
than
*NL*
he
knew
when
he
put
it
into
my
power
to
marry
a
poor
man
--
a
man
who
has
*NL*
borne
his
poverty
with
such
dignity
,
with
such
indifference
.
Mr.
Osmond
*NL*
has
never
scrambled
nor
struggled
--
he
has
cared
for
no
worldly
prize
.
If
*NL*
that
's
to
be
narrow
,
if
that
's
to
be
selfish
,
then
it
's
very
well
.
I
'm
*NL*
not
frightened
by
such
words
,
I
'm
not
even
displeased
;
I
'm
only
sorry
*NL*
that
you
should
make
a
mistake
.
Others
might
have
done
so
,
but
I
'm
*NL*
surprised
that
you
should
.
You
might
know
a
gentleman
when
you
see
*NL*
one
--
you
might
know
a
fine
mind
.
Mr.
Osmond
makes
no
mistakes
!
He
knows
*NL*
everything
,
he
understands
everything
,
he
has
the
kindest
,
gentlest
,
*NL*
highest
spirit
.
You
've
got
hold
of
some
false
idea
.
It
's
a
pity
,
but
*NL*
I
ca
n't
help
it
;
it
regards
you
more
than
me
.
''
Isabel
paused
a
moment
,
*NL*
looking
at
her
cousin
with
an
eye
illumined
by
a
sentiment
which
*NL*
contradicted
the
careful
calmness
of
her
manner
--
a
mingled
sentiment
,
*NL*
to
which
the
angry
pain
excited
by
his
words
and
the
wounded
pride
of
*NL*
having
needed
to
justify
a
choice
of
which
she
felt
only
the
nobleness
*NL*
and
purity
,
equally
contributed
.
Though
she
paused
Ralph
said
*NL*
nothing
;
he
saw
she
had
more
to
say
.
She
was
grand
,
but
she
was
highly
*NL*
solicitous
;
she
was
indifferent
,
but
she
was
all
in
a
passion
.
``
What
*NL*
sort
of
a
person
should
you
have
liked
me
to
marry
?
''
she
asked
suddenly
.
*NL*
``
You
talk
about
one
's
soaring
and
sailing
,
but
if
one
marries
at
all
one
*NL*
touches
the
earth
.
One
has
human
feelings
and
needs
,
one
has
a
heart
in
*NL*
one
's
bosom
,
and
one
must
marry
a
particular
individual
.
Your
mother
*NL*
has
never
forgiven
me
for
not
having
come
to
a
better
understanding
*NL*
with
Lord
Warburton
,
and
she
's
horrified
at
my
contenting
myself
with
a
*NL*
person
who
has
none
of
his
great
advantages
--
no
property
,
no
title
,
*NL*
no
honours
,
no
houses
,
nor
lands
,
nor
position
,
nor
reputation
,
nor
*NL*
brilliant
belongings
of
any
sort
.
It
's
the
total
absence
of
all
these
*NL*
things
that
pleases
me
.
Mr.
Osmond
's
simply
a
very
lonely
,
a
very
*NL*
cultivated
and
a
very
honest
man
--
he
's
not
a
prodigious
proprietor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
had
listened
with
great
attention
,
as
if
everything
she
said
*NL*
merited
deep
consideration
;
but
in
truth
he
was
only
half
thinking
of
*NL*
the
things
she
said
,
he
was
for
the
rest
simply
accommodating
himself
*NL*
to
the
weight
of
his
total
impression
--
the
impression
of
her
ardent
good
*NL*
faith
.
She
was
wrong
,
but
she
believed
;
she
was
deluded
,
but
she
was
*NL*
dismally
consistent
.
It
was
wonderfully
characteristic
of
her
that
,
*NL*
having
invented
a
fine
theory
,
about
Gilbert
Osmond
,
she
loved
him
not
*NL*
for
what
he
really
possessed
,
but
for
his
very
poverties
dressed
out
as
*NL*
honours
.
Ralph
remembered
what
he
had
said
to
his
father
about
wishing
*NL*
to
put
it
into
her
power
to
meet
the
requirements
of
her
imagination
.
He
*NL*
had
done
so
,
and
the
girl
had
taken
full
advantage
of
the
luxury
.
Poor
*NL*
Ralph
felt
sick
;
he
felt
ashamed
.
Isabel
had
uttered
her
last
words
with
*NL*
a
low
solemnity
of
conviction
which
virtually
terminated
the
discussion
,
*NL*
and
she
closed
it
formally
by
turning
away
and
walking
back
to
the
*NL*
house
.
Ralph
walked
beside
her
,
and
they
passed
into
the
court
together
*NL*
and
reached
the
big
staircase
.
Here
he
stopped
and
Isabel
paused
,
*NL*
turning
on
him
a
face
of
elation
--
absolutely
and
perversely
of
*NL*
gratitude
.
His
opposition
had
made
her
own
conception
of
her
conduct
*NL*
clearer
to
her
.
``
Shall
you
not
come
up
to
breakfast
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
want
no
breakfast
;
I
'm
not
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
eat
,
''
said
the
girl
;
``
you
live
on
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
very
much
,
and
I
shall
go
back
into
the
garden
and
take
another
*NL*
mouthful
.
I
came
thus
far
simply
to
say
this
.
I
told
you
last
year
that
*NL*
if
you
were
to
get
into
trouble
I
should
feel
terribly
sold
.
That
's
how
*NL*
I
feel
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
I
'm
in
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
's
in
trouble
when
one
's
in
error
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Isabel
;
``
I
shall
never
complain
of
my
trouble
to
you
!
''
*NL*
And
she
moved
up
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
,
standing
there
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
followed
her
with
*NL*
his
eyes
;
then
the
lurking
chill
of
the
high-walled
court
struck
him
and
*NL*
made
him
shiver
,
so
that
he
returned
to
the
garden
to
breakfast
on
the
*NL*
Florentine
sunshine
.

CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
,
when
she
strolled
in
the
Cascine
with
her
lover
,
felt
no
impulse
*NL*
to
tell
him
how
little
he
was
approved
at
Palazzo
Crescentini
.
The
*NL*
discreet
opposition
offered
to
her
marriage
by
her
aunt
and
her
cousin
*NL*
made
on
the
whole
no
great
impression
upon
her
;
the
moral
of
it
was
*NL*
simply
that
they
disliked
Gilbert
Osmond
.
This
dislike
was
not
alarming
*NL*
to
Isabel
;
she
scarcely
even
regretted
it
;
for
it
served
mainly
to
*NL*
throw
into
higher
relief
the
fact
,
in
every
way
so
honourable
,
that
she
*NL*
married
to
please
herself
.
One
did
other
things
to
please
other
people
;
*NL*
one
did
this
for
a
more
personal
satisfaction
;
and
Isabel
's
satisfaction
*NL*
was
confirmed
by
her
lover
's
admirable
good
conduct
.
Gilbert
Osmond
was
*NL*
in
love
,
and
he
had
never
deserved
less
than
during
these
still
,
bright
*NL*
days
,
each
of
them
numbered
,
which
preceded
the
fulfilment
of
his
*NL*
hopes
,
the
harsh
criticism
passed
upon
him
by
Ralph
Touchett
.
The
chief
*NL*
impression
produced
on
Isabel
's
spirit
by
this
criticism
was
that
the
*NL*
passion
of
love
separated
its
victim
terribly
from
every
one
but
the
*NL*
loved
object
.
She
felt
herself
disjoined
from
every
one
she
had
ever
*NL*
known
before
--
from
her
two
sisters
,
who
wrote
to
express
a
dutiful
hope
*NL*
that
she
would
be
happy
,
and
a
surprise
,
somewhat
more
vague
,
at
her
*NL*
not
having
chosen
a
consort
who
was
the
hero
of
a
richer
accumulation
of
*NL*
anecdote
;
from
Henrietta
,
who
,
she
was
sure
,
would
come
out
,
too
late
,
*NL*
on
purpose
to
remonstrate
;
from
Lord
Warburton
,
who
would
certainly
*NL*
console
himself
,
and
from
Caspar
Goodwood
,
who
perhaps
would
not
;
from
*NL*
her
aunt
,
who
had
cold
,
shallow
ideas
about
marriage
,
for
which
she
*NL*
was
not
sorry
to
display
her
contempt
;
and
from
Ralph
,
whose
talk
*NL*
about
having
great
views
for
her
was
surely
but
a
whimsical
cover
for
*NL*
a
personal
disappointment
.
Ralph
apparently
wished
her
not
to
marry
*NL*
at
all
--
that
was
what
it
really
meant
--
because
he
was
amused
with
the
*NL*
spectacle
of
her
adventures
as
a
single
woman
.
His
disappointment
made
*NL*
him
say
angry
things
about
the
man
she
had
preferred
even
to
him
:
Isabel
*NL*
flattered
herself
that
she
believed
Ralph
had
been
angry
.
It
was
the
*NL*
more
easy
for
her
to
believe
this
because
,
as
I
say
,
she
had
now
little
*NL*
free
or
unemployed
emotion
for
minor
needs
,
and
accepted
as
an
incident
,
*NL*
in
fact
quite
as
an
ornament
,
of
her
lot
the
idea
that
to
prefer
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
as
she
preferred
him
was
perforce
to
break
all
other
ties
.
She
*NL*
tasted
of
the
sweets
of
this
preference
,
and
they
made
her
conscious
,
*NL*
almost
with
awe
,
of
the
invidious
and
remorseless
tide
of
the
charmed
*NL*
and
possessed
condition
,
great
as
was
the
traditional
honour
and
imputed
*NL*
virtue
of
being
in
love
.
It
was
the
tragic
part
of
happiness
;
one
's
*NL*
right
was
always
made
of
the
wrong
of
some
one
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elation
of
success
,
which
surely
now
flamed
high
in
Osmond
,
emitted
*NL*
meanwhile
very
little
smoke
for
so
brilliant
a
blaze
.
Contentment
,
on
*NL*
his
part
,
took
no
vulgar
form
;
excitement
,
in
the
most
self-conscious
of
*NL*
men
,
was
a
kind
of
ecstasy
of
self-control
.
This
disposition
,
however
,
*NL*
made
him
an
admirable
lover
;
it
gave
him
a
constant
view
of
the
smitten
*NL*
and
dedicated
state
.
He
never
forgot
himself
,
as
I
say
;
and
so
he
*NL*
never
forgot
to
be
graceful
and
tender
,
to
wear
the
appearance
--
which
*NL*
presented
indeed
no
difficulty
--
of
stirred
senses
and
deep
intentions
.
*NL*
He
was
immensely
pleased
with
his
young
lady
;
Madame
Merle
had
made
him
*NL*
a
present
of
incalculable
value
.
What
could
be
a
finer
thing
to
live
*NL*
with
than
a
high
spirit
attuned
to
softness
?
For
would
not
the
softness
*NL*
be
all
for
one
's
self
,
and
the
strenuousness
for
society
,
which
admired
*NL*
the
air
of
superiority
?
What
could
be
a
happier
gift
in
a
companion
than
*NL*
a
quick
,
fanciful
mind
which
saved
one
repetitions
and
reflected
one
's
*NL*
thought
on
a
polished
,
elegant
surface
?
Osmond
hated
to
see
his
thought
*NL*
reproduced
literally
--
that
made
it
look
stale
and
stupid
;
he
preferred
*NL*
it
to
be
freshened
in
the
reproduction
even
as
``
words
''
by
music
.
His
*NL*
egotism
had
never
taken
the
crude
form
of
desiring
a
dull
wife
;
this
*NL*
lady
's
intelligence
was
to
be
a
silver
plate
,
not
an
earthen
one
--
a
*NL*
plate
that
he
might
heap
up
with
ripe
fruits
,
to
which
it
would
give
*NL*
a
decorative
value
,
so
that
talk
might
become
for
him
a
sort
of
served
*NL*
dessert
.
He
found
the
silver
quality
in
this
perfection
in
Isabel
;
he
*NL*
could
tap
her
imagination
with
his
knuckle
and
make
it
ring
.
He
knew
*NL*
perfectly
,
though
he
had
not
been
told
,
that
their
union
enjoyed
little
*NL*
favour
with
the
girl
's
relations
;
but
he
had
always
treated
her
so
*NL*
completely
as
an
independent
person
that
it
hardly
seemed
necessary
*NL*
to
express
regret
for
the
attitude
of
her
family
.
Nevertheless
,
one
*NL*
morning
,
he
made
an
abrupt
allusion
to
it
.
``
It
's
the
difference
in
our
*NL*
fortune
they
do
n't
like
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
think
I
'm
in
love
with
your
*NL*
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
speaking
of
my
aunt
--
of
my
cousin
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
``
How
do
you
*NL*
know
what
they
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
not
told
me
they
're
pleased
,
and
when
I
wrote
to
Mrs.
Touchett
*NL*
the
other
day
she
never
answered
my
note
.
If
they
had
been
delighted
I
*NL*
should
have
had
some
sign
of
it
,
and
the
fact
of
my
being
poor
and
you
*NL*
rich
is
the
most
obvious
explanation
of
their
reserve
.
But
of
course
*NL*
when
a
poor
man
marries
a
rich
girl
he
must
be
prepared
for
imputations
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
mind
them
;
I
only
care
for
one
thing
--
for
your
not
having
*NL*
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
.
I
do
n't
care
what
people
of
whom
I
ask
nothing
*NL*
think
--
I
'm
not
even
capable
perhaps
of
wanting
to
know
.
I
've
never
so
*NL*
concerned
myself
,
God
forgive
me
,
and
why
should
I
begin
to-day
,
when
I
*NL*
have
taken
to
myself
a
compensation
for
everything
?
I
wo
n't
pretend
*NL*
I
'm
sorry
you
're
rich
;
I
'm
delighted
.
I
delight
in
everything
that
's
*NL*
yours
--
whether
it
be
money
or
virtue
.
Money
's
a
horrid
thing
to
follow
,
*NL*
but
a
charming
thing
to
meet
.
It
seems
to
me
,
however
,
that
I
've
*NL*
sufficiently
proved
the
limits
of
my
itch
for
it
:
I
never
in
my
life
*NL*
tried
to
earn
a
penny
,
and
I
ought
to
be
less
subject
to
suspicion
than
*NL*
most
of
the
people
one
sees
grubbing
and
grabbing
.
I
suppose
it
's
their
*NL*
business
to
suspect
--
that
of
your
family
;
it
's
proper
on
the
whole
they
*NL*
should
.
They
'll
like
me
better
some
day
;
so
will
you
,
for
that
matter
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
my
business
is
not
to
make
myself
bad
blood
,
but
simply
to
*NL*
be
thankful
for
life
and
love
.
''
``
It
has
made
me
better
,
loving
you
,
''
he
*NL*
said
on
another
occasion
;
``
it
has
made
me
wiser
and
easier
and
--
I
wo
n't
*NL*
pretend
to
deny
--
brighter
and
nicer
and
even
stronger
.
I
used
to
want
*NL*
a
great
many
things
before
and
to
be
angry
I
did
n't
have
them
.
*NL*
Theoretically
I
was
satisfied
,
as
I
once
told
you
.
I
flattered
myself
*NL*
I
had
limited
my
wants
.
But
I
was
subject
to
irritation
;
I
used
to
*NL*
have
morbid
,
sterile
,
hateful
fits
of
hunger
,
of
desire
.
Now
I
'm
really
*NL*
satisfied
,
because
I
ca
n't
think
of
anything
better
.
It
's
just
as
when
*NL*
one
has
been
trying
to
spell
out
a
book
in
the
twilight
and
suddenly
the
*NL*
lamp
comes
in
.
I
had
been
putting
out
my
eyes
over
the
book
of
life
and
*NL*
finding
nothing
to
reward
me
for
my
pains
;
but
now
that
I
can
read
it
*NL*
properly
I
see
it
's
a
delightful
story
.
My
dear
girl
,
I
ca
n't
tell
you
*NL*
how
life
seems
to
stretch
there
before
us
--
what
a
long
summer
afternoon
*NL*
awaits
us
.
It
's
the
latter
half
of
an
Italian
day
--
with
a
golden
haze
,
*NL*
and
the
shadows
just
lengthening
,
and
that
divine
delicacy
in
the
light
,
*NL*
the
air
,
the
landscape
,
which
I
have
loved
all
my
life
and
which
you
*NL*
love
to-day
.
Upon
my
honour
,
I
do
n't
see
why
we
should
n't
get
on
.
We
've
*NL*
got
what
we
like
--
to
say
nothing
of
having
each
other
.
We
've
the
faculty
*NL*
of
admiration
and
several
capital
convictions
.
We
're
not
stupid
,
we
're
*NL*
not
mean
,
we
're
not
under
bonds
to
any
kind
of
ignorance
or
dreariness
.
*NL*
You
're
remarkably
fresh
,
and
I
'm
remarkably
well-seasoned
.
We
've
my
poor
*NL*
child
to
amuse
us
;
we
'll
try
and
make
up
some
little
life
for
her
.
It
's
*NL*
all
soft
and
mellow
--
it
has
the
Italian
colouring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
a
good
many
plans
,
but
they
left
themselves
also
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
latitude
;
it
was
a
matter
of
course
,
however
,
that
they
should
live
*NL*
for
the
present
in
Italy
.
It
was
in
Italy
that
they
had
met
,
Italy
had
*NL*
been
a
party
to
their
first
impressions
of
each
other
,
and
Italy
*NL*
should
be
a
party
to
their
happiness
.
Osmond
had
the
attachment
of
old
*NL*
acquaintance
and
Isabel
the
stimulus
of
new
,
which
seemed
to
assure
her
*NL*
a
future
at
a
high
level
of
consciousness
of
the
beautiful
.
The
desire
*NL*
for
unlimited
expansion
had
been
succeeded
in
her
soul
by
the
sense
*NL*
that
life
was
vacant
without
some
private
duty
that
might
gather
one
's
*NL*
energies
to
a
point
.
She
had
told
Ralph
she
had
``
seen
life
''
in
a
year
*NL*
or
two
and
that
she
was
already
tired
,
not
of
the
act
of
living
,
but
of
*NL*
that
of
observing
.
What
had
become
of
all
her
ardours
,
her
aspirations
,
*NL*
her
theories
,
her
high
estimate
of
her
independence
and
her
incipient
*NL*
conviction
that
she
should
never
marry
?
These
things
had
been
absorbed
*NL*
in
a
more
primitive
need
--
a
need
the
answer
to
which
brushed
away
*NL*
numberless
questions
,
yet
gratified
infinite
desires
.
It
simplified
the
*NL*
situation
at
a
stroke
,
it
came
down
from
above
like
the
light
of
the
*NL*
stars
,
and
it
needed
no
explanation
.
There
was
explanation
enough
in
the
*NL*
fact
that
he
was
her
lover
,
her
own
,
and
that
she
should
be
able
to
be
*NL*
of
use
to
him
.
She
could
surrender
to
him
with
a
kind
of
humility
,
she
*NL*
could
marry
him
with
a
kind
of
pride
;
she
was
not
only
taking
,
she
was
*NL*
giving
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
brought
Pansy
with
him
two
or
three
times
to
the
Cascine
--
Pansy
who
*NL*
was
very
little
taller
than
a
year
before
,
and
not
much
older
.
That
she
*NL*
would
always
be
a
child
was
the
conviction
expressed
by
her
father
,
who
*NL*
held
her
by
the
hand
when
she
was
in
her
sixteenth
year
and
told
her
to
*NL*
go
and
play
while
he
sat
down
a
little
with
the
pretty
lady
.
Pansy
wore
*NL*
a
short
dress
and
a
long
coat
;
her
hat
always
seemed
too
big
for
her
.
*NL*
She
found
pleasure
in
walking
off
,
with
quick
,
short
steps
,
to
the
*NL*
end
of
the
alley
,
and
then
in
walking
back
with
a
smile
that
seemed
an
*NL*
appeal
for
approbation
.
Isabel
approved
in
abundance
,
and
the
abundance
*NL*
had
the
personal
touch
that
the
child
's
affectionate
nature
craved
.
*NL*
She
watched
her
indications
as
if
for
herself
also
much
depended
on
*NL*
them
--
Pansy
already
so
represented
part
of
the
service
she
could
render
,
*NL*
part
of
the
responsibility
she
could
face
.
Her
father
took
so
the
*NL*
childish
view
of
her
that
he
had
not
yet
explained
to
her
the
new
*NL*
relation
in
which
he
stood
to
the
elegant
Miss
Archer
.
``
She
does
n't
*NL*
know
,
''
he
said
to
Isabel
;
``
she
does
n't
guess
;
she
thinks
it
perfectly
*NL*
natural
that
you
and
I
should
come
and
walk
here
together
simply
as
good
*NL*
friends
.
There
seems
to
me
something
enchantingly
innocent
in
that
;
it
's
*NL*
the
way
I
like
her
to
be
.
No
,
I
'm
not
a
failure
,
as
I
used
to
think
;
*NL*
I
've
succeeded
in
two
things
.
I
'm
to
marry
the
woman
I
adore
,
and
I
've
*NL*
brought
up
my
child
,
as
I
wished
,
in
the
old
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
fond
,
in
all
things
,
of
the
``
old
way
''
;
that
had
struck
*NL*
Isabel
as
one
of
his
fine
,
quiet
,
sincere
notes
.
``
It
occurs
to
me
that
*NL*
you
'll
not
know
whether
you
've
succeeded
until
you
've
told
her
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
You
must
see
how
she
takes
your
news
,
She
may
be
horrified
--
she
*NL*
may
be
jealous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
afraid
of
that
;
she
's
too
fond
of
you
on
her
own
account
.
I
*NL*
should
like
to
leave
her
in
the
dark
a
little
longer
--
to
see
if
it
will
*NL*
come
into
her
head
that
if
we
're
not
engaged
we
ought
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
impressed
by
Osmond
's
artistic
,
the
plastic
view
,
as
it
*NL*
somehow
appeared
,
of
Pansy
's
innocence
--
her
own
appreciation
of
it
being
*NL*
more
anxiously
moral
.
She
was
perhaps
not
the
less
pleased
when
he
told
*NL*
her
a
few
days
later
that
he
had
communicated
the
fact
to
his
daughter
,
*NL*
who
had
made
such
a
pretty
little
speech
--
``
Oh
,
then
I
shall
have
a
*NL*
beautiful
sister
!
''
She
was
neither
surprised
nor
alarmed
;
she
had
not
*NL*
cried
,
as
he
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
she
had
guessed
it
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
that
;
I
should
be
disgusted
if
I
believed
that
.
I
thought
it
*NL*
would
be
just
a
little
shock
;
but
the
way
she
took
it
proves
that
her
*NL*
good
manners
are
paramount
.
That
's
also
what
I
wished
.
You
shall
see
for
*NL*
yourself
;
to-morrow
she
shall
make
you
her
congratulations
in
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
meeting
,
on
the
morrow
,
took
place
at
the
Countess
Gemini
's
,
whither
*NL*
Pansy
had
been
conducted
by
her
father
,
who
knew
that
Isabel
was
to
come
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
to
return
a
visit
made
her
by
the
Countess
on
learning
*NL*
that
they
were
to
become
sisters-in-law
.
Calling
at
Casa
Touchett
the
*NL*
visitor
had
not
found
Isabel
at
home
;
but
after
our
young
woman
had
been
*NL*
ushered
into
the
Countess
's
drawing-room
Pansy
arrived
to
say
that
her
*NL*
aunt
would
presently
appear
.
Pansy
was
spending
the
day
with
that
lady
,
*NL*
who
thought
her
of
an
age
to
begin
to
learn
how
to
carry
herself
in
*NL*
company
.
It
was
Isabel
's
view
that
the
little
girl
might
have
given
*NL*
lessons
in
deportment
to
her
relative
,
and
nothing
could
have
justified
*NL*
this
conviction
more
than
the
manner
in
which
Pansy
acquitted
herself
*NL*
while
they
waited
together
for
the
Countess
.
Her
father
's
decision
,
the
*NL*
year
before
,
had
finally
been
to
send
her
back
to
the
convent
to
receive
*NL*
the
last
graces
,
and
Madame
Catherine
had
evidently
carried
out
her
*NL*
theory
that
Pansy
was
to
be
fitted
for
the
great
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
has
told
me
that
you
've
kindly
consented
to
marry
him
,
''
said
this
*NL*
excellent
woman
's
pupil
.
``
It
's
very
delightful
;
I
think
you
'll
suit
very
*NL*
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
I
shall
suit
YOU
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
suit
me
beautifully
;
but
what
I
mean
is
that
you
and
papa
will
*NL*
suit
each
other
.
You
're
both
so
quiet
and
so
serious
.
You
're
not
so
*NL*
quiet
as
he
--
or
even
as
Madame
Merle
;
but
you
're
more
quiet
than
many
*NL*
others
.
He
should
not
for
instance
have
a
wife
like
my
aunt
.
She
's
*NL*
always
in
motion
,
in
agitation
--
to-day
especially
;
you
'll
see
when
she
*NL*
comes
in
.
They
told
us
at
the
convent
it
was
wrong
to
judge
our
elders
,
*NL*
but
I
suppose
there
's
no
harm
if
we
judge
them
favourably
.
You
'll
be
a
*NL*
delightful
companion
for
papa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you
too
,
I
hope
,
''
Isabel
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
speak
first
of
him
on
purpose
.
I
've
told
you
already
what
I
myself
*NL*
think
of
you
;
I
liked
you
from
the
first
.
I
admire
you
so
much
that
I
*NL*
think
it
will
be
a
good
fortune
to
have
you
always
before
me
.
You
'll
be
*NL*
my
model
;
I
shall
try
to
imitate
you
though
I
'm
afraid
it
will
be
*NL*
very
feeble
.
I
'm
very
glad
for
papa
--
he
needed
something
more
than
*NL*
me
.
Without
you
I
do
n't
see
how
he
could
have
got
it
.
You
'll
be
my
*NL*
stepmother
,
but
we
must
n't
use
that
word
.
They
're
always
said
to
be
*NL*
cruel
;
but
I
do
n't
think
you
'll
ever
so
much
as
pinch
or
even
push
me
.
*NL*
I
'm
not
afraid
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
little
Pansy
,
''
said
Isabel
gently
,
``
I
shall
be
ever
so
kind
to
*NL*
you
.
''
A
vague
,
inconsequent
vision
of
her
coming
in
some
odd
way
to
need
*NL*
it
had
intervened
with
the
effect
of
a
chill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
then
,
I
've
nothing
to
fear
,
''
the
child
returned
with
her
*NL*
note
of
prepared
promptitude
.
What
teaching
she
had
had
,
it
seemed
to
*NL*
suggest
--
or
what
penalties
for
non-performance
she
dreaded
!
*NL*
*NL*
Her
description
of
her
aunt
had
not
been
incorrect
;
the
Countess
Gemini
*NL*
was
further
than
ever
from
having
folded
her
wings
.
She
entered
the
room
*NL*
with
a
flutter
through
the
air
and
kissed
Isabel
first
on
the
forehead
*NL*
and
then
on
each
cheek
as
if
according
to
some
ancient
prescribed
rite
.
*NL*
She
drew
the
visitor
to
a
sofa
and
,
looking
at
her
with
a
variety
of
*NL*
turns
of
the
head
,
began
to
talk
very
much
as
if
,
seated
brush
in
hand
*NL*
before
an
easel
,
she
were
applying
a
series
of
considered
touches
to
*NL*
a
composition
of
figures
already
sketched
in
.
``
If
you
expect
me
to
*NL*
congratulate
you
I
must
beg
you
to
excuse
me
.
I
do
n't
suppose
you
care
*NL*
if
I
do
or
not
;
I
believe
you
're
supposed
not
to
care
--
through
being
so
*NL*
clever
--
for
all
sorts
of
ordinary
things
.
But
I
care
myself
if
I
tell
*NL*
fibs
;
I
never
tell
them
unless
there
's
something
rather
good
to
be
*NL*
gained
.
I
do
n't
see
what
's
to
be
gained
with
you
--
especially
as
you
*NL*
would
n't
believe
me
.
I
do
n't
make
professions
any
more
than
I
make
paper
*NL*
flowers
or
flouncey
lampshades
--
I
do
n't
know
how
.
My
lampshades
would
be
*NL*
sure
to
take
fire
,
my
roses
and
my
fibs
to
be
larger
than
life
.
I
'm
very
*NL*
glad
for
my
own
sake
that
you
're
to
marry
Osmond
;
but
I
wo
n't
pretend
*NL*
I
'm
glad
for
yours
.
You
're
very
brilliant
--
you
know
that
's
the
way
*NL*
you
're
always
spoken
of
;
you
're
an
heiress
and
very
good-looking
and
*NL*
original
,
not
banal
;
so
it
's
a
good
thing
to
have
you
in
the
family
.
*NL*
Our
family
's
very
good
,
you
know
;
Osmond
will
have
told
you
that
;
and
*NL*
my
mother
was
rather
distinguished
--
she
was
called
the
American
Corinne
.
*NL*
But
we
're
dreadfully
fallen
,
I
think
,
and
perhaps
you
'll
pick
us
up
.
*NL*
I
've
great
confidence
in
you
;
there
are
ever
so
many
things
I
want
to
*NL*
talk
to
you
about
.
I
never
congratulate
any
girl
on
marrying
;
I
think
*NL*
they
ought
to
make
it
somehow
not
quite
so
awful
a
steel
trap
.
I
suppose
*NL*
Pansy
ought
n't
to
hear
all
this
;
but
that
's
what
she
has
come
to
me
*NL*
for
--
to
acquire
the
tone
of
society
.
There
's
no
harm
in
her
knowing
what
*NL*
horrors
she
may
be
in
for
.
When
first
I
got
an
idea
that
my
brother
had
*NL*
designs
on
you
I
thought
of
writing
to
you
,
to
recommend
you
,
in
the
*NL*
strongest
terms
,
not
to
listen
to
him
.
Then
I
thought
it
would
be
*NL*
disloyal
,
and
I
hate
anything
of
that
kind
.
Besides
,
as
I
say
,
I
was
*NL*
enchanted
for
myself
;
and
after
all
I
'm
very
selfish
.
By
the
way
,
you
*NL*
wo
n't
respect
me
,
not
one
little
mite
,
and
we
shall
never
be
intimate
.
*NL*
I
should
like
it
,
but
you
wo
n't
.
Some
day
,
all
the
same
,
we
shall
be
*NL*
better
friends
than
you
will
believe
at
first
.
My
husband
will
come
and
*NL*
see
you
,
though
,
as
you
probably
know
,
he
's
on
no
sort
of
terms
with
*NL*
Osmond
.
He
's
very
fond
of
going
to
see
pretty
women
,
but
I
'm
not
afraid
*NL*
of
you
.
In
the
first
place
I
do
n't
care
what
he
does
.
In
the
second
,
you
*NL*
wo
n't
care
a
straw
for
him
;
he
wo
n't
be
a
bit
,
at
any
time
,
your
affair
,
*NL*
and
,
stupid
as
he
is
,
he
'll
see
you
're
not
his
.
Some
day
,
if
you
can
*NL*
stand
it
,
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
him
.
Do
you
think
my
niece
ought
to
go
*NL*
out
of
the
room
?
Pansy
,
go
and
practise
a
little
in
my
boudoir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
stay
,
please
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
I
would
rather
hear
nothing
that
*NL*
Pansy
may
not
!

CHAPTER
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
of
the
autumn
of
1876
,
toward
dusk
,
a
young
man
of
*NL*
pleasing
appearance
rang
at
the
door
of
a
small
apartment
on
the
third
*NL*
floor
of
an
old
Roman
house
.
On
its
being
opened
he
enquired
for
Madame
*NL*
Merle
;
whereupon
the
servant
,
a
neat
,
plain
woman
,
with
a
French
face
*NL*
and
a
lady
's
maid
's
manner
,
ushered
him
into
a
diminutive
drawing-room
*NL*
and
requested
the
favour
of
his
name
.
``
Mr.
Edward
Rosier
,
''
said
the
*NL*
young
man
,
who
sat
down
to
wait
till
his
hostess
should
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
perhaps
not
have
forgotten
that
Mr.
Rosier
was
an
*NL*
ornament
of
the
American
circle
in
Paris
,
but
it
may
also
be
remembered
*NL*
that
he
sometimes
vanished
from
its
horizon
.
He
had
spent
a
portion
of
*NL*
several
winters
at
Pau
,
and
as
he
was
a
gentleman
of
constituted
habits
*NL*
he
might
have
continued
for
years
to
pay
his
annual
visit
to
this
*NL*
charming
resort
.
In
the
summer
of
1876
,
however
,
an
incident
befell
him
*NL*
which
changed
the
current
not
only
of
his
thoughts
,
but
of
his
customary
*NL*
sequences
.
He
passed
a
month
in
the
Upper
Engadine
and
encountered
at
*NL*
Saint
Moritz
a
charming
young
girl
.
To
this
little
person
he
began
to
*NL*
pay
,
on
the
spot
,
particular
attention
:
she
struck
him
as
exactly
the
*NL*
household
angel
he
had
long
been
looking
for
.
He
was
never
precipitate
,
*NL*
he
was
nothing
if
not
discreet
,
so
he
forbore
for
the
present
to
declare
*NL*
his
passion
;
but
it
seemed
to
him
when
they
parted
--
the
young
lady
to
go
*NL*
down
into
Italy
and
her
admirer
to
proceed
to
Geneva
,
where
he
was
under
*NL*
bonds
to
join
other
friends
--
that
he
should
be
romantically
wretched
if
*NL*
he
were
not
to
see
her
again
.
The
simplest
way
to
do
so
was
to
go
in
*NL*
the
autumn
to
Rome
,
where
Miss
Osmond
was
domiciled
with
her
family
.
Mr.
*NL*
Rosier
started
on
his
pilgrimage
to
the
Italian
capital
and
reached
it
*NL*
on
the
first
of
November
.
It
was
a
pleasant
thing
to
do
,
but
for
the
*NL*
young
man
there
was
a
strain
of
the
heroic
in
the
enterprise
.
He
might
*NL*
expose
himself
,
unseasoned
,
to
the
poison
of
the
Roman
air
,
which
in
*NL*
November
lay
,
notoriously
,
much
in
wait
.
Fortune
,
however
,
favours
the
*NL*
brave
;
and
this
adventurer
,
who
took
three
grains
of
quinine
a
day
,
had
*NL*
at
the
end
of
a
month
no
cause
to
deplore
his
temerity
.
He
had
made
to
*NL*
a
certain
extent
good
use
of
his
time
;
he
had
devoted
it
in
vain
*NL*
to
finding
a
flaw
in
Pansy
Osmond
's
composition
.
She
was
admirably
*NL*
finished
;
she
had
had
the
last
touch
;
she
was
really
a
consummate
piece
.
*NL*
He
thought
of
her
in
amorous
meditation
a
good
deal
as
he
might
have
*NL*
thought
of
a
Dresden-china
shepherdess
.
Miss
Osmond
,
indeed
,
in
the
*NL*
bloom
of
her
juvenility
,
had
a
hint
of
the
rococo
which
Rosier
,
whose
*NL*
taste
was
predominantly
for
that
manner
,
could
not
fail
to
appreciate
.
*NL*
That
he
esteemed
the
productions
of
comparatively
frivolous
periods
*NL*
would
have
been
apparent
from
the
attention
he
bestowed
upon
Madame
*NL*
Merle
's
drawing-room
,
which
,
although
furnished
with
specimens
of
every
*NL*
style
,
was
especially
rich
in
articles
of
the
last
two
centuries
.
He
*NL*
had
immediately
put
a
glass
into
one
eye
and
looked
round
;
and
then
``
By
*NL*
Jove
,
she
has
some
jolly
good
things
!
''
he
had
yearningly
murmured
.
The
*NL*
room
was
small
and
densely
filled
with
furniture
;
it
gave
an
impression
*NL*
of
faded
silk
and
little
statuettes
which
might
totter
if
one
moved
.
*NL*
Rosier
got
up
and
wandered
about
with
his
careful
tread
,
bending
over
*NL*
the
tables
charged
with
knick-knacks
and
the
cushions
embossed
with
*NL*
princely
arms
.
When
Madame
Merle
came
in
she
found
him
standing
before
*NL*
the
fireplace
with
his
nose
very
close
to
the
great
lace
flounce
*NL*
attached
to
the
damask
cover
of
the
mantel
.
He
had
lifted
it
delicately
,
*NL*
as
if
he
were
smelling
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
old
Venetian
,
''
she
said
;
``
it
's
rather
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
good
for
this
;
you
ought
to
wear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
tell
me
you
have
some
better
in
Paris
,
in
the
same
situation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
I
ca
n't
wear
mine
,
''
smiled
the
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
n't
!
I
've
better
lace
than
that
to
wear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
wandered
,
lingeringly
,
round
the
room
again
.
``
You
've
some
very
*NL*
good
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
hate
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
get
rid
of
them
?
''
the
young
man
quickly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
good
to
have
something
to
hate
:
one
works
it
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
my
things
,
''
said
Mr.
Rosier
as
he
sat
there
flushed
with
all
his
*NL*
recognitions
.
``
But
it
's
not
about
them
,
nor
about
yours
,
that
I
came
*NL*
to
talk
to
you
.
''
He
paused
a
moment
and
then
,
with
greater
softness
:
``
I
*NL*
care
more
for
Miss
Osmond
than
for
all
the
bibelots
in
Europe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
opened
wide
eyes
.
``
Did
you

She
looked
at

stroking

folded

drawn
up
to

*NL*

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Rosier
's
face
assumed
an
expression
of
alarm
;
a
suit
for
the
hand
*NL*
of
Pansy
Osmond
was
even
a
more
complicated
business
than
his
taste

had
allowed

But
the
extreme
good
sense
which
*NL*
he
concealed
under
a
surface
suggesting
that

a
careful
owner

``
best

came
to
his
assistance

He
resolved

worthy
of
an
aspirant

was

already
a
model

discretion

he
saw
nothing

made
it
improper

himself

visit
to
Miss

He
reflected
*NL*
constantly
on
what
his

had
said
to
him

turned
over
in
his

mind
the
impression
of
her
rather
circumspect
tone
.
He
had
gone
to
her
*NL*
de
confiance
,
as
they
put
it
in
Paris
;
but
it
was
possible
he
had
been
*NL*
precipitate
.
He
found
difficulty
in
thinking
of
himself
as
rash
--
he
had
*NL*
incurred
this
reproach
so
rarely
;
but
it
certainly
was
true
that
he
had
*NL*
known
Madame
Merle
only
for
the
last
month
,
and
that
his
thinking
her
*NL*
a
delightful
woman
was
not
,
when
one
came
to
look
into
it
,
a
reason
for
*NL*
assuming
that
she
would
be
eager
to
push
Pansy
Osmond
into
his
arms
,
*NL*
gracefully
arranged
as
these
members
might
be
to
receive
her
.
She
had
*NL*
indeed
shown
him
benevolence
,
and
she
was
a
person
of
consideration
*NL*
among
the
girl
's
people
,
where
she
had
a
rather
striking
appearance
*NL*
-LRB-
Rosier
had
more
than
once
wondered
how
she
managed
it
-RRB-
of
being
*NL*
intimate
without
being
familiar
.
But
possibly
he
had
exaggerated
these
*NL*
advantages
.
There
was
no
particular
reason
why
she
should
take
trouble
*NL*
for
him
;
a
charming
woman
was
charming
to
every
one
,
and
Rosier
felt
*NL*
rather
a
fool
when
he
thought
of
his
having
appealed
to
her
on
the
*NL*
ground
that
she
had
distinguished
him
.
Very
likely
--
though
she
had
*NL*
appeared
to
say
it
in
joke
--
she
was
really
only
thinking
of
his
*NL*
bibelots
.
Had
it
come
into
her
head
that
he
might
offer
her
two
or
three
*NL*
of
the
gems
of
his
collection
?
If
she
would
only
help
him
to
marry
Miss
*NL*
Osmond
he
would
present
her
with
his
whole
museum
.
He
could
hardly
say
*NL*
so
to
her
outright
;
it
would
seem
too
gross
a
bribe
.
But
he
should
like
*NL*
her
to
believe
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
these
thoughts
that
he
went
again
to
Mrs.
Osmond
's
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Osmond
having
an
``
evening
''
--
she
had
taken
the
Thursday
of
each
*NL*
week
--
when
his
presence
could
be
accounted
for
on
general
principles
of
*NL*
civility
.
The
object
of
Mr.
Rosier
's
well-regulated
affection
dwelt
in
*NL*
a
high
house
in
the
very
heart
of
Rome
;
a
dark
and
massive
structure
*NL*
overlooking
a
sunny
piazzetta
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
Farnese
*NL*
Palace
.
In
a
palace
,
too
,
little
Pansy
lived
--
a
palace
by
Roman
measure
,
*NL*
but
a
dungeon
to
poor
Rosier
's
apprehensive
mind
.
It
seemed
to
him
of
*NL*
evil
omen
that
the
young
lady
he
wished
to
marry
,
and
whose
fastidious
*NL*
father
he
doubted
of
his
ability
to
conciliate
,
should
be
immured
in
*NL*
a
kind
of
domestic
fortress
,
a
pile
which
bore
a
stern
old
Roman
name
,
*NL*
which
smelt
of
historic
deeds
,
of
crime
and
craft
and
violence
,
which
*NL*
was
mentioned
in
``
Murray
''
and
visited
by
tourists
who
looked
,
on
a
vague
*NL*
survey
,
disappointed
and
depressed
,
and
which
had
frescoes
by
Caravaggio
*NL*
in
the
piano
nobile
and
a
row
of
mutilated
statues
and
dusty
urns
in
the
*NL*
wide
,
nobly-arched
loggia
overhanging
the
damp
court
where
a
fountain
*NL*
gushed
out
of
a
mossy
niche
.
In
a
less
preoccupied
frame
of
mind
he
*NL*
could
have
done
justice
to
the
Palazzo
Roccanera
;
he
could
have
entered
*NL*
into
the
sentiment
of
Mrs.
Osmond
,
who
had
once
told
him
that
on
*NL*
settling
themselves
in
Rome
she
and
her
husband
had
chosen
this
*NL*
habitation
for
the
love
of
local
colour
.
It
had
local
colour
enough
,
*NL*
and
though
he
knew
less
about
architecture
than
about
Limoges
enamels
*NL*
he
could
see
that
the
proportions
of
the
windows
and
even
the
details
*NL*
of
the
cornice
had
quite
the
grand
air
.
But
Rosier
was
haunted
by
the
*NL*
conviction
that
at
picturesque
periods
young
girls
had
been
shut
up
*NL*
there
to
keep
them
from
their
true
loves
,
and
hen
,
under
the
threat
of
*NL*
being
thrown
into
convents
,
had
been
forced
into
unholy
marriages
.
There
*NL*
was
one
point
,
however
,
to
which
he
always
did
justice
when
once
he
*NL*
found
himself
in
Mrs.
Osmond
's
warm
,
rich-looking
reception-rooms
,
which
*NL*
were
on
the
second
floor
.
He
acknowledged
that
these
people
were
very
*NL*
strong
in
``
good
things
.
''
It
was
a
taste
of
Osmond
's
own
--
not
at
all
of
*NL*
hers
;
this
she
had
told
him
the
first
time
he
came
to
the
house
,
when
,
*NL*
after
asking
himself
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
whether
they
had
even
*NL*
better
``
French
''
than
he
in
Paris
,
he
was
obliged
on
the
spot
to
admit
*NL*
that
they
had
,
very
much
,
and
vanquished
his
envy
,
as
a
gentleman
*NL*
should
,
to
the
point
of
expressing
to
his
hostess
his
pure
admiration
of
*NL*
her
treasures
.
He
learned
from
Mrs.
Osmond
that
her
husband
had
made
a
*NL*
large
collection
before
their
marriage
and
that
,
though
he
had
annexed
*NL*
a
number
of
fine
pieces
within
the
last
three
years
,
he
had
achieved
his
*NL*
greatest
finds
at
a
time
when
he
had
not
the
advantage
of
her
advice
.
*NL*
Rosier
interpreted
this
information
according
to
principles
of
his
own
.
*NL*
For
``
advice
''
read
``
cash
,
''
he
said
to
himself
;
and
the
fact
that
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
had
landed
his
highest
prizes
during
his
impecunious
season
*NL*
confirmed
his
most
cherished
doctrine
--
the
doctrine
that
a
collector
may
*NL*
freely
be
poor
if
he
be
only
patient
.
In
general
,
when
Rosier
presented
*NL*
himself
on
a
Thursday
evening
,
his
first
recognition
was
for
the
walls
*NL*
of
the
saloon
;
there
were
three
or
four
objects
his
eyes
really
*NL*
yearned
for
.
But
after
his
talk
with
Madame
Merle
he
felt
the
extreme
*NL*
seriousness
of
his
position
;
and
now
,
when
he
came
in
,
he
looked
about
*NL*
for
the
daughter
of
the
house
with
such
eagerness
as
might
be
permitted
*NL*
a
gentleman
whose
smile
,
as
he
crossed
a
threshold
,
always
took
*NL*
everything
comfortable
for
granted
.

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
was
not
in
the
first
of
the
rooms
,
a
large
apartment
with
a
*NL*
concave
ceiling
and
walls
covered
with
old
red
damask
;
it
was
here
*NL*
Mrs.
Osmond
usually
sat
--
though
she
was
not
in
her
most
customary
place
*NL*
to-night
--
and
that
a
circle
of
more
especial
intimates
gathered
about
*NL*
the
fire
.
The
room
was
flushed
with
subdued
,
diffused
brightness
;
it
*NL*
contained
the
larger
things
and
--
almost
always
--
an
odour
of
flowers
.
*NL*
Pansy
on
this
occasion
was
presumably
in
the
next
of
the
series
,
the
*NL*
resort
of
younger
visitors
,
where
tea
was
served
.
Osmond
stood
before
*NL*
the
chimney
,
leaning
back
with
his
hands
behind
him
;
he
had
one
foot
up
*NL*
and
was
warming
the
sole
.
Half
a
dozen
persons
,
scattered
near
him
,
were
*NL*
talking
together
;
but
he
was
not
in
the
conversation
;
his
eyes
had
an
*NL*
expression
,
frequent
with
them
,
that
seemed
to
represent
them
as
engaged
*NL*
with
objects
more
worth
their
while
than
the
appearances
actually
*NL*
thrust
upon
them
.
Rosier
,
coming
in
unannounced
,
failed
to
attract
his
*NL*
attention
;
but
the
young
man
,
who
was
very
punctilious
,
though
he
was
*NL*
even
exceptionally
conscious
that
it
was
the
wife
,
not
the
husband
,
he
*NL*
had
come
to
see
,
went
up
to
shake
hands
with
him
.
Osmond
put
out
his
*NL*
left
hand
,
without
changing
his
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
d'ye
do
?
My
wife
's
somewhere
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
fear
;
I
shall
find
her
,
''
said
Rosier
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
,
however
,
took
him
in
;
he
had
never
in
his
life
felt
himself
so
*NL*
efficiently
looked
at
.
``
Madame
Merle
has
told
him
,
and
he
does
n't
like
*NL*
it
,
''
he
privately
reasoned
.
He
had
hoped
Madame
Merle
would
be
there
,
*NL*
but
she
was
not
in
sight
;
perhaps
she
was
in
one
of
the
other
rooms
or
*NL*
would
come
later
.
He
had
never
especially
delighted
in
Gilbert
Osmond
,
*NL*
having
a
fancy
he
gave
himself
airs
.
But
Rosier
was
not
quickly
*NL*
resentful
,
and
where
politeness
was
concerned
had
ever
a
strong
need
of
*NL*
being
quite
in
the
right
.
He
looked
round
him
and
smiled
,
all
without
*NL*
help
,
and
then
in
a
moment
,
``
I
saw
a
jolly
good
piece
of
Capo
di
Monte
*NL*
to-day
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
answered
nothing
at
first
;
but
presently
,
while
he
warmed
his
*NL*
boot-sole
,
``
I
do
n't
care
a
fig
for
Capo
di
Monte
!
''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
're
not
losing
your
interest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
old
pots
and
plates
?
Yes
,
I
'm
losing
my
interest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosier
for
an
instant
forgot
the
delicacy
of
his
position
.
``
You
're
not
*NL*
thinking
of
parting
with
a
--
a
piece
or
two
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
thinking
of
parting
with
anything
at
all
,
Mr.
Rosier
,
''
said
*NL*
Osmond
,
with
his
eyes
still
on
the
eyes
of
his
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
want
to
keep
,
but
not
to
add
,
''
Rosier
remarked
brightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
I
've
nothing
I
wish
to
match
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Rosier
was
aware
he
had
blushed
;
he
was
distressed
at
his
want
of
*NL*
assurance
.
``
Ah
,
well
,
I
have
!
''
was
all
he
could
murmur
;
and
he
knew
*NL*
his
murmur
was
partly
lost
as
he
turned
away
.
He
took
his
course
to
the
*NL*
adjoining
room
and
met
Mrs.
Osmond
coming
out
of
the
deep
doorway
.
She
*NL*
was
dressed
in
black
velvet
;
she
looked
high
and
splendid
,
as
he
had
*NL*
said
,
and
yet
oh
so
radiantly
gentle
!
We
know
what
Mr.
Rosier
thought
*NL*
of
her
and
the
terms
in
which
,
to
Madame
Merle
,
he
had
expressed
his
*NL*
admiration
.
Like
his
appreciation
of
her
dear
little
stepdaughter
it
*NL*
was
based
partly
on
his
eye
for
decorative
character
,
his
instinct
for
*NL*
authenticity
;
but
also
on
a
sense
for
uncatalogued
values
,
for
that
*NL*
secret
of
a
``
lustre
''
beyond
any
recorded
losing
or
rediscovering
,
*NL*
which
his
devotion
to
brittle
wares
had
still
not
disqualified
him
*NL*
to
recognise
.
Mrs.
Osmond
,
at
present
,
might
well
have
gratified
such
*NL*
tastes
.
The
years
had
touched
her
only
to
enrich
her
;
the
flower
of
her
*NL*
youth
had
not
faded
,
it
only
hung
more
quietly
on
its
stem
.
She
had
lost
*NL*
something
of
that
quick
eagerness
to
which
her
husband
had
privately
*NL*
taken
exception
--
she
had
more
the
air
of
being
able
to
wait
.
Now
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
framed
in
the
gilded
doorway
,
she
struck
our
young
man
as
the
*NL*
picture
of
a
gracious
lady
.
``
You
see
I
'm
very
regular
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
*NL*
who
should
be
if
I
'm
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
've
known
you
longer
than
any
one
here
.
But
we
must
n't
indulge
in
*NL*
tender
reminiscences
.
I
want
to
introduce
you
to
a
young
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
please
,
what
young
lady
?
''
Rosier
was
immensely
obliging
;
but
this
*NL*
was
not
what
he
had
come
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
sits
there
by
the
fire
in
pink
and
has
no
one
to
speak
to
.
''
Rosier
*NL*
hesitated
a
moment
.
``
Ca
n't
Mr.
Osmond
speak
to
her
?
He
's
within
six
feet
*NL*
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Osmond
also
hesitated
.
``
She
's
not
very
lively
,
and
he
does
n't
like
*NL*
dull
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
's
good
enough
for
me
?
Ah
now
,
that
's
hard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
mean
that
you
've
ideas
for
two
.
And
then
you
're
so
obliging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
's
not
--
to
me
.
''
And
Mrs.
Osmond
vaguely
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
sign
he
should
be
doubly
so
to
other
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
tell
him
,
''
she
said
,
still
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
I
want
some
tea
,
''
Rosier
went
on
,
looking
wistfully
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
perfect
.
Go
and
give
some
to
my
young
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
;
but
after
that
I
'll
abandon
her
to
her
fate
.
The
simple
*NL*
truth
is
I
'm
dying
to
have
a
little
talk
with
Miss
Osmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Isabel
,
turning
away
,
``
I
ca
n't
help
you
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
later
,
while
he
handed
a
tea-cup
to
the
damsel
in
pink
,
*NL*
whom
he
had
conducted
into
the
other
room
,
he
wondered
whether
,
in
*NL*
making
to
Mrs.
Osmond
the
profession
I
have
just
quoted
,
he
had
broken
*NL*
the
spirit
of
his
promise
to
Madame
Merle
.
Such
a
question
was
capable
*NL*
of
occupying
this
young
man
's
mind
for
a
considerable
time
.
At
last
,
*NL*
however
,
he
became
--
comparatively
speaking
--
reckless
;
he
cared
little
*NL*
what
promises
he
might
break
.
The
fate
to
which
he
had
threatened
to
*NL*
abandon
the
damsel
in
pink
proved
to
be
none
so
terrible
;
for
Pansy
*NL*
Osmond
,
who
had
given
him
the
tea
for
his
companion
--
Pansy
was
as
fond
*NL*
as
ever
of
making
tea
--
presently
came
and
talked
to
her
.
Into
this
mild
*NL*
colloquy
Edward
Rosier
entered
little
;
he
sat
by
moodily
,
watching
his
*NL*
small
sweetheart
.
If
we
look
at
her
now
through
his
eyes
we
shall
at
*NL*
first
not
see
much
to
remind
us
of
the
obedient
little
girl
who
,
at
*NL*
Florence
,
three
years
before
,
was
sent
to
walk
short
distances
in
the
*NL*
Cascine
while
her
father
and
Miss
Archer
talked
together
of
matters
*NL*
sacred
to
elder
people
.
But
after
a
moment
we
shall
perceive
that
if
at
*NL*
nineteen
Pansy
has
become
a
young
lady
she
does
n't
really
fill
out
the
*NL*
part
;
that
if
she
has
grown
very
pretty
she
lacks
in
a
deplorable
degree
*NL*
the
quality
known
and
esteemed
in
the
appearance
of
females
as
style
;
*NL*
and
that
if
she
is
dressed
with
great
freshness
she
wears
her
smart
*NL*
attire
with
an
undisguised
appearance
of
saving
it
--
very
much
as
if
it
*NL*
were
lent
her
for
the
occasion
.
Edward
Rosier
,
it
would
seem
,
would
have
*NL*
been
just
the
man
to
note
these
defects
;
and
in
point
of
fact
there
was
*NL*
not
a
quality
of
this
young
lady
,
of
any
sort
,
that
he
had
not
noted
.
*NL*
Only
he
called
her
qualities
by
names
of
his
own
--
some
of
which
indeed
*NL*
were
happy
enough
.
``
No
,
she
's
unique
--
she
's
absolutely
unique
,
''
he
used
*NL*
to
say
to
himself
;
and
you
may
be
sure
that
not
for
an
instant
would
he
*NL*
have
admitted
to
you
that
she
was
wanting
in
style
.
Style
?
Why
,
she
had
*NL*
the
style
of
a
little
princess
;
if
you
could
n't
see
it
you
had
no
eye
.
*NL*
It
was
not
modern
,
it
was
not
conscious
,
it
would
produce
no
impression
*NL*
in
Broadway
;
the
small
,
serious
damsel
,
in
her
stiff
little
dress
,
only
*NL*
looked
like
an
Infanta
of
Velasquez
.
This
was
enough
for
Edward
Rosier
,
*NL*
who
thought
her
delightfully
old-fashioned
.
Her
anxious
eyes
,
her
*NL*
charming
lips
,
her
slip
of
a
figure
,
were
as
touching
as
a
childish
*NL*
prayer
.
He
had
now
an
acute
desire
to
know
just
to
what
point
she
liked
*NL*
him
--
a
desire
which
made
him
fidget
as
he
sat
in
his
chair
.
It
made
him
*NL*
feel
hot
,
so
that
he
had
to
pat
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
;
he
*NL*
had
never
been
so
uncomfortable
.
She
was
such
a
perfect
jeune
fille
,
and
*NL*
one
could
n't
make
of
a
jeune
fille
the
enquiry
requisite
for
throwing
*NL*
light
on
such
a
point
.
A
jeune
fille
was
what
Rosier
had
always
dreamed
*NL*
of
--
a
jeune
fille
who
should
yet
not
be
French
,
for
he
had
felt
that
*NL*
this
nationality
would
complicate
the
question
.
He
was
sure
Pansy
had
*NL*
never
looked
at
a
newspaper
and
that
,
in
the
way
of
novels
,
if
she
*NL*
had
read
Sir
Walter
Scott
it
was
the
very
most
.
An
American
jeune
*NL*
fille
--
what
could
be
better
than
that
?
She
would
be
frank
and
gay
,
and
*NL*
yet
would
not
have
walked
alone
,
nor
have
received
letters
from
men
,
*NL*
nor
have
been
taken
to
the
theatre
to
see
the
comedy
of
manners
.
Rosier
*NL*
could
not
deny
that
,
as
the
matter
stood
,
it
would
be
a
breach
of
*NL*
hospitality
to
appeal
directly
to
this
unsophisticated
creature
;
but
*NL*
he
was
now
in
imminent
danger
of
asking
himself
if
hospitality
were
*NL*
the
most
sacred
thing
in
the
world
.
Was
not
the
sentiment
that
he
*NL*
entertained
for
Miss
Osmond
of
infinitely
greater
importance
?
Of
greater
*NL*
importance
to
him
--
yes
;
but
not
probably
to
the
master
of
the
house
.
*NL*
There
was
one
comfort
;
even
if
this
gentleman
had
been
placed
on
his
*NL*
guard
by
Madame
Merle
he
would
not
have
extended
the
warning
to
Pansy
;
*NL*
it
would
not
have
been
part
of
his
policy
to
let
her
know
that
a
*NL*
prepossessing
young
man
was
in
love
with
her
.
But
he
WAS
in
love
*NL*
with
her
,
the
prepossessing
young
man
;
and
all
these
restrictions
of
*NL*
circumstance
had
ended
by
irritating
him
.
What
had
Gilbert
Osmond
meant
*NL*
by
giving
him
two
fingers
of
his
left
hand
?
If
Osmond
was
rude
,
surely
*NL*
he
himself
might
be
bold
.
He
felt
extremely
bold
after
the
dull
girl
*NL*
in
so
vain
a
disguise
of
rose-colour
had
responded
to
the
call
of
her
*NL*
mother
,
who
came
in
to
say
,
with
a
significant
simper
at
Rosier
,
that
*NL*
she
must
carry
her
off
to
other
triumphs
.
The
mother
and
daughter
*NL*
departed
together
,
and
now
it
depended
only
upon
him
that
he
should
be
*NL*
virtually
alone
with
Pansy
.
He
had
never
been
alone
with
her
before
;
*NL*
he
had
never
been
alone
with
a
jeune
fille
.
It
was
a
great
moment
;
poor
*NL*
Rosier
began
to
pat
his
forehead
again
.
There
was
another
room
beyond
*NL*
the
one
in
which
they
stood
--
a
small
room
that
had
been
thrown
open
and
*NL*
lighted
,
but
that
,
the
company
not
being
numerous
,
had
remained
empty
*NL*
all
the
evening
.
It
was
empty
yet
;
it
was
upholstered
in
pale
yellow
;
*NL*
there
were
several
lamps
;
through
the
open
door
it
looked
the
very
*NL*
temple
of
authorised
love
.
Rosier
gazed
a
moment
through
this
aperture
;
*NL*
he
was
afraid
that
Pansy
would
run
away
,
and
felt
almost
capable
of
*NL*
stretching
out
a
hand
to
detain
her
.
But
she
lingered
where
the
other
*NL*
maiden
had
left
them
,
making
no
motion
to
join
a
knot
of
visitors
on
*NL*
the
far
side
of
the
room
.
For
a
little
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
was
*NL*
frightened
--
too
frightened
perhaps
to
move
;
but
a
second
glance
assured
*NL*
him
she
was
not
,
and
he
then
reflected
that
she
was
too
innocent
indeed
*NL*
for
that
.
After
a
supreme
hesitation
he
asked
her
if
he
might
go
and
*NL*
look
at
the
yellow
room
,
which
seemed
so
attractive
yet
so
virginal
.
He
*NL*
had
been
there
already
with
Osmond
,
to
inspect
the
furniture
,
which
was
*NL*
of
the
First
French
Empire
,
and
especially
to
admire
the
clock
-LRB-
which
he
*NL*
did
n't
really
admire
-RRB-
,
an
immense
classic
structure
of
that
period
.
He
*NL*
therefore
felt
that
he
had
now
begun
to
manoeuvre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
you
may
go
,
''
said
Pansy
;
``
and
if
you
like
I
'll
show
you
.
''
*NL*
She
was
not
in
the
least
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
hoped
you
'd
say
;
you
're
so
very
kind
,
''
Rosier
*NL*
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
in
together
;
Rosier
really
thought
the
room
very
ugly
,
and
it
*NL*
seemed
cold
.
The
same
idea
appeared
to
have
struck
Pansy
.
``
It
's
not
for
*NL*
winter
evenings
;
it
's
more
for
summer
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
papa
's
taste
;
he
*NL*
has
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
good
deal
,
Rosier
thought
;
but
some
of
it
was
very
bad
.
He
*NL*
looked
about
him
;
he
hardly
knew
what
to
say
in
such
a
situation
.
*NL*
``
Does
n't
Mrs.
Osmond
care
how
her
rooms
are
done
?
Has
she
no
taste
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
a
great
deal
;
but
it
's
more
for
literature
,
''
said
Pansy
--
``
and
*NL*
for
conversation
.
But
papa
cares
also
for
those
things
.
I
think
he
knows
*NL*
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosier
was
silent
a
little
.
``
There
's
one
thing
I
'm
sure
he
knows
!
''
he
*NL*
broke
out
presently
.
``
He
knows
that
when
I
come
here
it
's
,
with
all
*NL*
respect
to
him
,
with
all
respect
to
Mrs.
Osmond
,
who
's
so
charming
--
it
's
*NL*
really
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
to
see
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
me
?
''
And
Pansy
raised
her
vaguely
troubled
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
you
;
that
's
what
I
come
for
,
''
Rosier
repeated
,
feeling
the
*NL*
intoxication
of
a
rupture
with
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
stood
looking
at
him
,
simply
,
intently
,
openly
;
a
blush
was
not
*NL*
needed
to
make
her
face
more
modest
.
``
I
thought
it
was
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
was
not
disagreeable
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
tell
;
I
did
n't
know
.
You
never
told
me
,
''
said
Pansy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
of
offending
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
offend
me
,
''
the
young
girl
murmured
,
smiling
as
if
an
angel
*NL*
had
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
me
then
,
Pansy
?
''
Rosier
asked
very
gently
,
feeling
very
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
walked
to
the
chimney-piece
where
the
big
cold
Empire
clock
*NL*
was
perched
;
they
were
well
within
the
room
and
beyond
observation
from
*NL*
without
.
The
tone
in
which
she
had
said
these
four
words
seemed
to
him
*NL*
the
very
breath
of
nature
,
and
his
only
answer
could
be
to
take
her
*NL*
hand
and
hold
it
a
moment
.
Then
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
.
She
submitted
,
*NL*
still
with
her
pure
,
trusting
smile
,
in
which
there
was
something
*NL*
ineffably
passive
.
She
liked
him
--
she
had
liked
him
all
the
while
;
now
*NL*
anything
might
happen
!
She
was
ready
--
she
had
been
ready
always
,
waiting
*NL*
for
him
to
speak
.
If
he
had
not
spoken
she
would
have
waited
for
ever
;
*NL*
but
when
the
word
came
she
dropped
like
the
peach
from
the
shaken
tree
.
*NL*
Rosier
felt
that
if
he
should
draw
her
toward
him
and
hold
her
to
his
*NL*
heart
she
would
submit
without
a
murmur
,
would
rest
there
without
a
*NL*
question
.
It
was
true
that
this
would
be
a
rash
experiment
in
a
yellow
*NL*
Empire
salottino
.
She
had
known
it
was
for
her
he
came
,
and
yet
like
*NL*
what
a
perfect
little
lady
she
had
carried
it
off
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
dear
to
me
,
''
he
murmured
,
trying
to
believe
that
there
was
*NL*
after
all
such
a
thing
as
hospitality
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
a
moment
at
her
hand
,
where
he
had
kissed
it
.
``
Did
you
say
*NL*
papa
knows
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
me
just
now
he
knows
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
must
make
sure
,
''
said
Pansy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
,
when
once
I
'm
sure
of
YOU
!
''
Rosier
murmured
in
her
ear
;
*NL*
whereupon
she
turned
back
to
the
other
rooms
with
a
little
air
of
*NL*
consistency
which
seemed
to
imply
that
their
appeal
should
be
immediate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
rooms
meanwhile
had
become
conscious
of
the
arrival
of
Madame
*NL*
Merle
,
who
,
wherever
she
went
,
produced
an
impression
when
she
entered
.
*NL*
How
she
did
it
the
most
attentive
spectator
could
not
have
told
you
,
for
*NL*
she
neither
spoke
loud
,
nor
laughed
profusely
,
nor
moved
rapidly
,
nor
*NL*
dressed
with
splendour
,
nor
appealed
in
any
appreciable
manner
to
the
*NL*
audience
.
Large
,
fair
,
smiling
,
serene
,
there
was
something
in
her
very
*NL*
tranquillity
that
diffused
itself
,
and
when
people
looked
round
it
was
*NL*
because
of
a
sudden
quiet
.
On
this
occasion
she
had
done
the
quietest
*NL*
thing
she
could
do
;
after
embracing
Mrs.
Osmond
,
which
was
more
*NL*
striking
,
she
had
sat
down
on
a
small
sofa
to
commune
with
the
master
*NL*
of
the
house
.
There
was
a
brief
exchange
of
commonplaces
between
these
*NL*
two
--
they
always
paid
,
in
public
,
a
certain
formal
tribute
to
the
*NL*
commonplace
--
and
then
Madame
Merle
,
whose
eyes
had
been
wandering
,
asked
*NL*
if
little
Mr.
Rosier
had
come
this
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came
nearly
an
hour
ago
--
but
he
has
disappeared
,
''
Osmond
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
's
Pansy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
other
room
.
There
are
several
people
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
probably
among
them
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
see
him
?
''
Osmond
asked
in
a
provokingly
pointless
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
looked
at
him
a
moment
;
she
knew
each
of
his
tones
to
the
*NL*
eighth
of
a
note
.
``
Yes
,
I
should
like
to
say
to
him
that
I
've
told
you
*NL*
what
he
wants
,
and
that
it
interests
you
but
feebly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tell
him
that
.
He
'll
try
to
interest
me
more
--
which
is
exactly
*NL*
what
I
do
n't
want
.
Tell
him
I
hate
his
proposal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
n't
hate
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
signify
;
I
do
n't
love
it
.
I
let
him
see
that
,
myself
,
this
*NL*
evening
;
I
was
rude
to
him
on
purpose
.
That
sort
of
thing
's
a
great
*NL*
bore
.
There
's
no
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
him
that
you
'll
take
time
and
think
it
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
do
that
.
He
'll
hang
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
discourage
him
he
'll
do
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
in
the
one
case
he
'll
try
to
talk
and
explain
--
which
would
be
*NL*
exceedingly
tiresome
.
In
the
other
he
'll
probably
hold
his
tongue
and
go
*NL*
in
for
some
deeper
game
.
That
will
leave
me
quiet
.
I
hate
talking
with
a
*NL*
donkey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
you
call
poor
Mr.
Rosier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
a
nuisance
--
with
his
eternal
majolica
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
dropped
her
eyes
;
she
had
a
faint
smile
.
``
He

a
gentleman

*NL*

has
a
charming
temper
;
and
,
after
all
,
an
income
of
forty
thousand
*NL*
francs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
misery
--
`
genteel
'
misery
,
''
Osmond
broke
in
.
``
It
's
not
what
I
've
*NL*
dreamed
of
for
Pansy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
then
.
He
has
promised
me
not
to
speak
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
believe
him
?
''
Osmond
asked
absentmindedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
.
Pansy
has
thought
a
great
deal
about
him
;
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
suppose
you
consider
that
that
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
consider
it
matters
at
all

but
neither
do
I
believe
she
has
*NL*
thought
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
opinion
's
more
convenient
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
told
you
she
's
in
love
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
do
you
take
her
?
And
for
what
do
you
take
me
?
''
Madame
Merle
*NL*
added
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
had
raised
his
foot
and
was
resting
his
slim
ankle
on
the
other
*NL*
knee
;
he
clasped
his
ankle
in
his
hand
familiarly
--
his
long
,
fine
*NL*
forefinger
and
thumb
could
make
a
ring
for
it
--
and
gazed
a
while
*NL*
before
him
.
``
This
kind
of
thing
does
n't
find
me
unprepared
.
It
's
what
I
*NL*
educated
her
for
.
It
was
all
for
this
--
that
when
such
a
case
should
come
*NL*
up
she
should
do
what
I
prefer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
afraid
that
she
'll
not
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
where
's
the
hitch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
any
.
But
,
all
the
same
,
I
recommend
you
not
to
get
rid
of
*NL*
Mr.
Rosier
.
Keep
him
on
hand
;
he
may
be
useful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
keep
him
.
Keep
him
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
;
I
'll
put
him
into
a
corner
and
allow
him
so
much
a
day
.
''
*NL*
Madame
Merle
had
,
for
the
most
part
,
while
they
talked
,
been
glancing
*NL*
about
her
;
it
was
her
habit
in
this
situation
,
just
as
it
was
her
habit
*NL*
to
interpose
a
good
many
blank-looking
pauses
.
A
long
drop
followed
the
*NL*
last
words
I
have
quoted
;
and
before
it
had
ended
she
saw
Pansy
come
out
*NL*
of
the
adjoining
room
,
followed
by
Edward
Rosier
.
The
girl
advanced
a
*NL*
few
steps
and
then
stopped
and
stood
looking
at
Madame
Merle
and
at
her
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
spoken
to
her
,
''
Madame
Merle
went
on
to
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
companion
never
turned
his
head
.
``
So
much
for
your
belief
in
his
*NL*
promises
.
He
ought
to
be
horsewhipped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
intends
to
confess
,
poor
little
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
got
up
;
he
had
now
taken
a
sharp
look
at
his
daughter
.
``
It
*NL*
does
n't
matter
,
''
he
murmured
,
turning
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
after
a
moment
came
up
to
Madame
Merle
with
her
little
manner
*NL*
of
unfamiliar
politeness
.
This
lady
's
reception
of
her
was
not
more
*NL*
intimate
;
she
simply
,
as
she
rose
from
the
sofa
,
gave
her
a
friendly
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
late
,
''
the
young
creature
gently
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
child
,
I
'm
never
later
than
I
intend
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
had
not
got
up
to
be
gracious
to
Pansy
;
she
moved
toward
*NL*
Edward
Rosier
.
He
came
to
meet
her
and
,
very
quickly
,
as
if
to
get
it
*NL*
off
his
mind
,
``
I
've
spoken
to
her
!
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
Mr.
Rosier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
tell
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
told
me
.
Behave
properly
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
and
come
*NL*
and
see
me
to-morrow
at
a
quarter
past
five
.
''
She
was
severe
,
and
in
*NL*
the
manner
in
which
she
turned
her
back
to
him
there
was
a
degree
of
*NL*
contempt
which
caused
him
to
mutter
a
decent
imprecation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
intention
of
speaking
to
Osmond
;
it
was
neither
the
time
nor
*NL*
the
place
.
But
he
instinctively
wandered
toward
Isabel
,
who
sat
talking
*NL*
with
an
old
lady
.
He
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
her
;
the
old
lady
*NL*
was
Italian
,
and
Rosier
took
for
granted
she
understood
no
English
.
``
You
*NL*
said
just
now
you
would
n't
help
me
,
''
he
began
to
Mrs.
Osmond
.
``
Perhaps
*NL*
you
'll
feel
differently
when
you
know
--
when
you
know
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
met
his
hesitation
.
``
When
I
know
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
she
's
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
we
've
come
to
an
understanding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
all
wrong
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
It
wo
n't
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Rosier
gazed
at
her
half-pleadingly
,
half-angrily
;
a
sudden
flush
*NL*
testified
to
his
sense
of
injury
.
``
I
've
never
been
treated
so
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
What
is
there
against
me
,
after
all
?
That
's
not
the
way
I
'm
usually
*NL*
considered
.
I
could
have
married
twenty
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
you
did
n't
.
I
do
n't
mean
twenty
times
,
but
once
,
*NL*
comfortably
,
''
Isabel
added
,
smiling
kindly
.
``
You
're
not
rich
enough
for
*NL*
Pansy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
care
a
straw
for
one
's
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
her
father
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
he
has
proved
that
!
''
cried
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
got
up
,
turning
away
from
him
,
leaving
her
old
lady
without
*NL*
ceremony
;
and
he
occupied
himself
for
the
next
ten
minutes
in
pretending
*NL*
to
look
at
Gilbert
Osmond
's
collection
of
miniatures
,
which
were
neatly
*NL*
arranged
on
a
series
of
small
velvet
screens
.
But
he
looked
without
*NL*
seeing
;
his
cheek
burned
;
he
was
too
full
of
his
sense
of
injury
.
It
was
*NL*
certain
that
he
had
never
been
treated
that
way
before
;
he
was
not
used
*NL*
to
being
thought
not
good
enough
.
He
knew
how
good
he
was
,
and
if
such
*NL*
a
fallacy
had
not
been
so
pernicious
he
could
have
laughed
at
it
.
He
*NL*
searched
again
for
Pansy
,
but
she
had
disappeared
,
and
his
main
desire
*NL*
was
now
to
get
out
of
the
house
.
Before
doing
so
he
spoke
once
more
to
*NL*
Isabel
;
it
was
not
agreeable
to
him
to
reflect
that
he
had
just
said
a
*NL*
rude
thing
to
her
--
the
only
point
that
would
now
justify
a
low
view
of
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
referred
to
Mr.
Osmond
as
I
should
n't
have
done
,
a
while
ago
,
''
he
*NL*
began
.
``
But
you
must
remember
my
situation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember
what
you
said
,
''
she
answered
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
're
offended
,
and
now
you
'll
never
help
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
an
instant
,
and
then
with
a
change
of
tone
:
``
It
's
not
*NL*
that
I
wo
n't
;
I
simply
ca
n't
!
''
Her
manner
was
almost
passionate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
COULD
,
just
a
little
,
I
'd
never
again
speak
of
your
husband
save
*NL*
as
an
angel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
inducement
's
great
,
''
said
Isabel
gravely
--
inscrutably
,
as
he
*NL*
afterwards
,
to
himself
,
called
it
;
and
she
gave
him
,
straight
in
the
*NL*
eyes
,
a
look
which
was
also
inscrutable
.
It
made
him
remember
somehow
*NL*
that
he
had
known
her
as
a
child
;
and
yet
it
was
keener
than
he
liked
,
*NL*
and
he
took
himself
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
see
Madame
Merle
on
the
morrow
,
and
to
his
surprise
she
let
*NL*
him
off
rather
easily
.
But
she
made
him
promise
that
he
would
stop
*NL*
there
till
something
should
have
been
decided
.
Mr.
Osmond
had
had
higher
*NL*
expectations
;
it
was
very
true
that
as
he
had
no
intention
of
giving
his
*NL*
daughter
a
portion
such
expectations
were
open
to
criticism
or
even
,
if
*NL*
one
would
,
to
ridicule
.
But
she
would
advise
Mr.
Rosier
not
to
take
that
*NL*
tone
;
if
he
would
possess
his
soul
in
patience
he
might
arrive
at
his
*NL*
felicity
.
Mr.
Osmond
was
not
favourable
to
his
suit
,
but
it
would
n't
be
*NL*
a
miracle
if
he
should
gradually
come
round
.
Pansy
would
never
defy
*NL*
her
father
,
he
might
depend
on
that
;
so
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
*NL*
precipitation
.
Mr.
Osmond
needed
to
accustom
his
mind
to
an
offer
of
a
*NL*
sort
that
he
had
not
hitherto
entertained
,
and
this
result
must
come
of
*NL*
itself
--
it
was
useless
to
try
to
force
it
.
Rosier
remarked
that
his
own
*NL*
situation
would
be
in
the
meanwhile
the
most
uncomfortable
in
the
world
,
*NL*
and
Madame
Merle
assured
him
that
she
felt
for
him
.
But
,
as
she
justly
*NL*
declared
,
one
could
n't
have
everything
one
wanted
;
she
had
learned
that
*NL*
lesson
for
herself
.
There
would
be
no
use
in
his
writing
to
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
,
who
had
charged
her
to
tell
him
as
much
.
He
wished
the
matter
*NL*
dropped
for
a
few
weeks
and
would
himself
write
when
he
should
have
*NL*
anything
to
communicate
that
it
might
please
Mr.
Rosier
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
like
your
having
spoken
to
Pansy
,
Ah
,
he
does
n't
like
it
at
*NL*
all
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
perfectly
willing
to
give
him
a
chance
to
tell
me
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
that
he
'll
tell
you
more
than
you
care
to
hear
.
Go
to
the
*NL*
house
,
for
the
next
month
,
as
little
as
possible
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
little
as
possible
?
Who
's
to
measure
the
possibility
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
measure
it
.
Go
on
Thursday
evenings
with
the
rest
of
the
world
,
*NL*
but
do
n't
go
at
all
at
odd
times
,
and
do
n't
fret
about
Pansy
.
I
'll
see
*NL*
that
she
understands
everything
.
She
's
a
calm
little
nature
;
she
'll
take
*NL*
it
quietly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
Rosier
fretted
about
Pansy
a
good
deal
,
but
he
did
as
he
was
*NL*
advised
,
and
awaited
another
Thursday
evening
before
returning
to
*NL*
Palazzo
Roccanera
.
There
had
been
a
party
at
dinner
,
so
that
though
he
*NL*
went
early
the
company
was
already
tolerably
numerous
.
Osmond
,
as
usual
,
*NL*
was
in
the
first
room
,
near
the
fire
,
staring
straight
at
the
door
,
so
*NL*
that
,
not
to
be
distinctly
uncivil
,
Rosier
had
to
go
and
speak
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
that
you
can
take
a
hint
,
''
Pansy
's
father
said
,
slightly
*NL*
closing
his
keen
,
conscious
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
no
hints
.
But
I
took
a
message
,
as
I
supposed
it
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
took
it
?
Where
did
you
take
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
poor
Rosier
he
was
being
insulted
,
and
he
waited
a
moment
,
*NL*
asking
himself
how
much
a
true
lover
ought
to
submit
to
.
``
Madame
Merle
*NL*
gave
me
,
as
I
understood
it
,
a
message
from
you
--
to
the
effect
that
you
*NL*
declined
to
give
me
the
opportunity
I
desire
,
the
opportunity
to
explain
*NL*
my
wishes
to
you
.
''
And
he
flattered
himself
he
spoke
rather
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
what
Madame
Merle
has
to
do
with
it
.
Why
did
you
apply
to
*NL*
Madame
Merle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
her
for
an
opinion
--
for
nothing
more
.
I
did
so
because
she
had
*NL*
seemed
to
me
to
know
you
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
know
me
so
well
as
she
thinks
,
''
said
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
for
that
,
because
she
has
given
me
some
little
ground
for
*NL*
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
stared
into
the
fire
a
moment
.
``
I
set
a
great
price
on
my
*NL*
daughter

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
set
a
higher
one

I

her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish

very
well

Osmond
went
on
with
a
dry
impertinence
*NL*
which
,
in
another
mood
,
poor
Rosier
would
have
admired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
pretend
she
'd
marry
well
in
marrying
me

She
could
n't

marry
a

loves
her
more

or
whom

I
may
venture
to
add
,
she
loves
*NL*
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
bound
to
accept
your
theories
as
to
whom
my
daughter
*NL*
loves

--
and
Osmond
looked
up
with
a
quick
,
cold
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
theorising

Your
daughter
has
spoken

*NL*
*NL*
``

,
''
Osmond
continued
,
now
bending
forward
a
little
and
dropping
*NL*
his
eyes
to
his
boot-toes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
her
promise
,
sir
!
''
cried
Rosier
with
the
sharpness
of
*NL*
exasperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
their
voices
had
been
pitched
very
low
before
,
such
a
note
attracted
*NL*
some
attention
from
the
company
.
Osmond
waited
till
this
little
movement
*NL*
had
subsided
;
then
he
said
,
all
undisturbed
:
``
I
think
she
has
no
*NL*
recollection
of
having
given
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
been
standing
with
their
faces
to
the
fire
,
and
after
he
had
*NL*
uttered
these
last
words
the
master
of
the
house
turned
round
again
*NL*
to
the
room
.
Before
Rosier
had
time
to
reply
he
perceived
that
a
*NL*
gentleman
--
a
stranger
--
had
just
come
in
,
unannounced
,
according
to
the
*NL*
Roman
custom
,
and
was
about
to
present
himself
to
his
host
.
The
latter
*NL*
smiled
blandly
,
but
somewhat
blankly
;
the
visitor
had
a
handsome
face
*NL*
and
a
large
,
fair
beard
,
and
was
evidently
an
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
apparently
do
n't
recognise
me
,
''
he
said
with
a
smile
that
expressed
*NL*
more
than
Osmond
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
now
I
do
.
I
expected
so
little
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosier
departed
and
went
in
direct
pursuit
of
Pansy
.
He
sought
her
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
in
the
neighbouring
room
,
but
he
again
encountered
Mrs.
Osmond
*NL*
in
his
path
.
He
gave
his
hostess
no
greeting
--
he
was
too
righteously
*NL*
indignant
,
but
said
to
her
crudely
:
``
Your
husband
's
awfully
*NL*
cold-blooded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
the
same
mystical
smile
he
had
noticed
before
.
``
You
ca
n't
*NL*
expect
every
one
to
be
as
hot
as
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
cold
,
but
I
'm
cool
.
What
has
he
been
doing
to
his
*NL*
daughter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
take
any
interest
?
''
Rosier
demanded
with
his
sense
that
she
*NL*
too
was
irritating
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
she
answered
nothing
;
then
,
``
No
!
''
she
said
abruptly
and
*NL*
with
a
quickened
light
in
her
eyes
which
directly
contradicted
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
if
I
do
n't
believe
that
.
Where
's
Miss
Osmond
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
corner
,
making
tea
.
Please
leave
her
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosier
instantly
discovered
his
friend
,
who
had
been
hidden
by
*NL*
intervening
groups
.
He
watched
her
,
but
her
own
attention
was
entirely
*NL*
given
to
her
occupation
.
``
What
on
earth
has
he
done
to
her
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
again
imploringly
.
``
He
declares
to
me
she
has
given
me
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
not
given
you
up
,
''
Isabel
said
in
a
low
tone
and
without
*NL*
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
thank
you
for
that
!
Now
I
'll
leave
her
alone
as
long
as
you
think
*NL*
proper
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hardly
spoken
when
he
saw
her
change
colour
,
and
became
aware
*NL*
that
Osmond
was
coming
toward
her
accompanied
by
the
gentleman
who
had
*NL*
just
entered
.
He
judged
the
latter
,
in
spite
of
the
advantage
of
good
*NL*
looks
and
evident
social
experience
,
a
little
embarrassed
.
``
Isabel
,
''
*NL*
said
her
husband
,
``
I
bring
you
an
old
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Osmond
's
face
,
though
it
wore
a
smile
,
was
,
like
her
old
friend
's
,
*NL*
not
perfectly
confident
.
``
I
'm
very
happy
to
see
Lord
Warburton
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
Rosier
turned
away
and
,
now
that
his
talk
with
her
had
been
*NL*
interrupted
,
felt
absolved
from
the
little
pledge
he
had
just
taken
.
He
*NL*
had
a
quick
impression
that
Mrs.
Osmond
would
n't
notice
what
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
in
fact
,
to
do
him
justice
,
for
some
time
quite
ceased
to
observe
*NL*
him
.
She
had
been
startled
;
she
hardly
knew
if
she
felt
a
pleasure
or
*NL*
a
pain
.
Lord
Warburton
,
however
,
now
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
her
,
*NL*
was
plainly
quite
sure
of
his
own
sense
of
the
matter
;
though
his
grey
*NL*
eyes
had
still
their
fine
original
property
of
keeping
recognition
and
*NL*
attestation
strictly
sincere
.
He
was
``
heavier
''
than
of
yore
and
looked
*NL*
older
;
he
stood
there
very
solidly
and
sensibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
did
n't
expect
to
see
me
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
've
but
just
*NL*
arrived
.
Literally
,
I
only
got
here
this
evening
.
You
see
I
've
lost
*NL*
no
time
in
coming
to
pay
you
my
respects
.
I
knew
you
were
at
home
on
*NL*
Thursdays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
the
fame
of
your
Thursdays
has
spread
to
England
,
''
Osmond
*NL*
remarked
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
kind
of
Lord
Warburton
to
come
so
soon
;
we
're
greatly
*NL*
flattered
,
''
Isabel
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well
,
it
's
better
than
stopping
in
one
of
those
horrible
inns
,
''
*NL*
Osmond
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hotel
seems
very
good
;
I
think
it
's
the
same
at
which
I
saw
you
*NL*
four
years
since
.
You
know
it
was
here
in
Rome
that
we
first
met
;
it
's
a
*NL*
long
time
ago
.
Do
you
remember
where
I
bade
you
good-bye
?
''
his
lordship
*NL*
asked
of
his
hostess
.
``
It
was
in
the
Capitol
,
in
the
first
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
that
myself
,
''
said
Osmond
.
``
I
was
there
at
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
remember
you
there
.
I
was
very
sorry
to
leave
Rome
--
so
sorry
*NL*
that
,
somehow
or
other
,
it
became
almost
a
dismal
memory
,
and
I
've
never
*NL*
cared
to
come
back
till
to-day
.
But
I
knew
you
were
living
here
,
''
her
*NL*
old
friend
went
on
to
Isabel
,
``
and
I
assure
you
I
've
often
thought
of
*NL*
you
.
It
must
be
a
charming
place
to
live
in
,
''
he
added
with
a
look
,
*NL*
round
him
,
at
her
established
home
,
in
which
she
might
have
caught
the
*NL*
dim
ghost
of
his
old
ruefulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
should
have
been
glad
to
see
you
at
any
time
,
''
Osmond
observed
with
*NL*
propriety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
very
much
.
I
have
n't
been
out
of
England
since
then
.
Till
a
*NL*
month
ago
I
really
supposed
my
travels
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
of
you
from
time
to
time
,
''
said
Isabel
,
who
had
already
,
*NL*
with
her
rare
capacity
for
such
inward
feats
,
taken
the
measure
of
what
*NL*
meeting
him
again
meant
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
've
heard
no
harm
.
My
life
has
been
a
remarkably
complete
*NL*
blank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
the
good
reigns
in
history
,
''
Osmond
suggested
.
He
appeared
to
*NL*
think
his
duties
as
a
host
now
terminated
--
he
had
performed
them
so
*NL*
conscientiously
.
Nothing
could
have
been
more
adequate
,
more
*NL*
nicely
measured
,
than
his
courtesy
to
his
wife
's
old
friend
.
It
*NL*
was
punctilious
,
it
was
explicit
,
it
was
everything
but
natural
--
a
*NL*
deficiency
which
Lord
Warburton
,
who
,
himself
,
had
on
the
whole
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
nature
,
may
be
supposed
to
have
perceived
.
``
I
'll
leave
you
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Osmond
together
,
''
he
added
.
``
You
have
reminiscences
into
which
I
*NL*
do
n't
enter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
you
lose
a
good
deal
!
''
Lord
Warburton
called
after
him
,
as
*NL*
he
moved
away
,
in
a
tone
which
perhaps
betrayed
overmuch
an
appreciation
*NL*
of
his
generosity
.
Then
the
visitor
turned
on
Isabel
the
deeper
,
the
*NL*
deepest
,
consciousness
of
his
look
,
which
gradually
became
more
serious
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
really
very
glad
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
pleasant
.
You
're
very
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
that
you
're
changed
--
a
little
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
just
hesitated
.
``
Yes
--
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
for
the
worse
,
of
course
;
and
yet
how
can
I
say
for
the
*NL*
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
shall
have
no
scruple
in
saying
that
to
YOU
,
''
she
bravely
*NL*
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well
,
for
me
--
it
's
a
long
time
.
It
would
be
a
pity
there
should
n't
*NL*
be
something
to
show
for
it
.
''
They
sat
down
and
she
asked
him
about
*NL*
his
sisters
,
with
other
enquiries
of
a
somewhat
perfunctory
kind
.
He
*NL*
answered
her
questions
as
if
they
interested
him
,
and
in
a
few
moments
*NL*
she
saw
--
or
believed
she
saw
--
that
he
would
press
with
less
of
his
*NL*
whole
weight
than
of
yore
.
Time
had
breathed
upon
his
heart
and
,
without
*NL*
chilling
it
,
given
it
a
relieved
sense
of
having
taken
the
air
.
Isabel
*NL*
felt
her
usual
esteem
for
Time
rise
at
a
bound
.
Her
friend
's
manner
was
*NL*
certainly
that
of
a
contented
man
,
one
who
would
rather
like
people
,
or
*NL*
like
her
at
least
,
to
know
him
for
such
.
``
There
's
something
I
must
tell
*NL*
you
without
more
delay
,
''
he
resumed
.
``
I
've
brought
Ralph
Touchett
with
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brought
him
with
you
?
''
Isabel
's
surprise
was
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
at
the
hotel
;
he
was
too
tired
to
come
out
and
has
gone
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
to
see
him
,
''
she
immediately
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
what
I
hoped
you
'd
do
.
I
had
an
idea
you
had
n't
seen
*NL*
much
of
him
since
your
marriage
,
that
in
fact
your
relations
were
a
--
a
*NL*
little
more
formal
.
That
's
why
I
hesitated
--
like
an
awkward
Briton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
as
fond
of
Ralph
as
ever
,
''
Isabel
answered
.
``
But
why
has
he
come
to
*NL*
Rome
?
''
The
declaration
was
very
gentle
,
the
question
a
little
sharp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
's
very
far
gone
,
Mrs.
Osmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rome
then
is
no
place
for
him
.
I
heard
from
him
that
he
had
determined
*NL*
to
give
up
his
custom
of
wintering
abroad
and
to
remain
in
England
,
*NL*
indoors
,
in
what
he
called
an
artificial
climate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
,
he
does
n't
succeed
with
the
artificial
!
I
went
to
see
him
*NL*
three
weeks
ago
,
at
Gardencourt
,
and
found
him
thoroughly
ill
.
He
has
*NL*
been
getting
worse
every
year
,
and
now
he
has
no
strength
left
.
He
*NL*
smokes
no
more
cigarettes
!
He
had
got
up
an
artificial
climate
indeed
;
*NL*
the
house
was
as
hot
as
Calcutta
.
Nevertheless
he
had
suddenly
taken
it
*NL*
into
his
head
to
start
for
Sicily
.
I
did
n't
believe
in
it
--
neither
did
*NL*
the
doctors
,
nor
any
of
his
friends
.
His
mother
,
as
I
suppose
you
know
,
*NL*
is
in
America
,
so
there
was
no
one
to
prevent
him
.
He
stuck
to
his
idea
*NL*
that
it
would
be
the
saving
of
him
to
spend
the
winter
at
Catania
.
*NL*
He
said
he
could
take
servants
and
furniture
,
could
make
himself
*NL*
comfortable
,
but
in
point
of
fact
he
has
n't
brought
anything
.
I
wanted
*NL*
him
at
least
to
go
by
sea
,
to
save
fatigue
;
but
he
said
he
hated
the
sea
*NL*
and
wished
to
stop
at
Rome
.
After
that
,
though
I
thought
it
all
rubbish
,
*NL*
I
made
up
my
mind
to
come
with
him
.
I
'm
acting
as
--
what
do
you
call
it
*NL*
in
America
?
--
as
a
kind
of
moderator
.
Poor
Ralph
's
very
moderate
now
.
We
*NL*
left
England
a
fortnight
ago
,
and
he
has
been
very
bad
on
the
way
.
He
*NL*
ca
n't
keep
warm
,
and
the
further
south
we
come
the
more
he
feels
the
*NL*
cold
.
He
has
got
rather
a
good
man
,
but
I
'm
afraid
he
's
beyond
human
*NL*
help
.
I
wanted
him
to
take
with
him
some
clever
fellow
--
I
mean
some
*NL*
sharp
young
doctor
;
but
he
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
If
you
do
n't
mind
my
*NL*
saying
so
,
I
think
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
time
for
Mrs.
Touchett
to
*NL*
decide
on
going
to
America
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
had
listened
eagerly
;
her
face
was
full
of
pain
and
wonder
.
``
My
*NL*
aunt
does
that
at
fixed
periods
and
lets
nothing
turn
her
aside
.
When
*NL*
the
date
comes
round
she
starts
;
I
think
she
'd
have
started
if
Ralph
had
*NL*
been
dying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sometimes
think
he
IS
dying
,
''
Lord
Warburton
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
sprang
up
.
``
I
'll
go
to
him
then
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
checked
her
;
he
was
a
little
disconcerted
at
the
quick
effect
of
his
*NL*
words
.
``
I
do
n't
mean
I
thought
so
to-night
.
On
the
contrary
,
to-day
,
*NL*
in
the
train
,
he
seemed
particularly
well
;
the
idea
of
our
reaching
*NL*
Rome
--
he
's
very
fond
of
Rome
,
you
know
--
gave
him
strength
.
An
hour
ago
,
*NL*
when
I
bade
him
goodnight
,
he
told
me
he
was
very
tired
,
but
very
happy
.
*NL*
Go
to
him
in
the
morning
;
that
's
all
I
mean
.
I
did
n't
tell
him
I
was
*NL*
coming
here
;
I
did
n't
decide
to
till
after
we
had
separated
.
Then
I
*NL*
remembered
he
had
told
me
you
had
an
evening
,
and
that
it
was
this
very
*NL*
Thursday
.
It
occurred
to
me
to
come
in
and
tell
you
he
's
here
,
and
let
*NL*
you
know
you
had
perhaps
better
not
wait
for
him
to
call
.
I
think
he
*NL*
said
he
had
n't
written
to
you
.
''
There
was
no
need
of
Isabel
's
declaring
*NL*
that
she
would
act
upon
Lord
Warburton
's
information
;
she
looked
,
as
she
*NL*
sat
there
,
like
a
winged
creature
held
back
.
``
Let
alone
that
I
wanted
to
*NL*
see
you
for
myself
,
''
her
visitor
gallantly
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
Ralph
's
plan
;
it
seems
to
me
very
wild
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
I
was
glad
to
think
of
him
between
those
thick
walls
at
Gardencourt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
completely
alone
there
;
the
thick
walls
were
his
only
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
went
to
see
him
;
you
've
been
extremely
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
I
had
nothing
to
do
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
hear
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
you
're
doing
great
things
.
Every
one
*NL*
speaks
of
you
as
a
great
statesman
,
and
I
'm
perpetually
seeing
your
name
*NL*
in
the
Times
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
does
n't
appear
to
hold
it
in
reverence
.
*NL*
You
're
apparently
as
wild
a
radical
as
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
feel
nearly
so
wild
;
you
know
the
world
has
come
round
to
me
.
*NL*
Touchett
and
I
have
kept
up
a
sort
of
parliamentary
debate
all
the
way
*NL*
from
London
.
I
tell
him
he
's
the
last
of
the
Tories
,
and
he
calls
me
*NL*
the
King
of
the
Goths
--
says
I
have
,
down
to
the
details
of
my
personal
*NL*
appearance
,
every
sign
of
the
brute
.
So
you
see
there
's
life
in
him
*NL*
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
had
many
questions
to
ask
about
Ralph
,
but
she
abstained
from
*NL*
asking
them
all
.
She
would
see
for
herself
on
the
morrow
.
She
perceived
*NL*
that
after
a
little
Lord
Warburton
would
tire
of
that
subject
--
he
had
a
*NL*
conception
of
other
possible
topics
.
She
was
more
and
more
able
to
say
*NL*
to
herself
that
he
had
recovered
,
and
,
what
is
more
to
the
point
,
she
*NL*
was
able
to
say
it
without
bitterness
.
He
had
been
for
her
,
of
old
,
*NL*
such
an
image
of
urgency
,
of
insistence
,
of
something
to
be
resisted
*NL*
and
reasoned
with
,
that
his
reappearance
at
first
menaced
her
with
a
new
*NL*
trouble
.
But
she
was
now
reassured
;
she
could
see
he
only
wished
to
live
*NL*
with
her
on
good
terms
,
that
she
was
to
understand
he
had
forgiven
her
*NL*
and
was
incapable
of
the
bad
taste
of
making
pointed
allusions
.
This
was
*NL*
not
a
form
of
revenge
,
of
course
;
she
had
no
suspicion
of
his
wishing
to
*NL*
punish
her
by
an
exhibition
of
disillusionment
;
she
did
him
the
justice
*NL*
to
believe
it
had
simply
occurred
to
him
that
she
would
now
take
a
*NL*
good-natured
interest
in
knowing
he
was
resigned
.
It
was
the
resignation
*NL*
of
a
healthy
,
manly
nature
,
in
which
sentimental
wounds
could
never
*NL*
fester
.
British
politics
had
cured
him
;
she
had
known
they
would
.
She
*NL*
gave
an
envious
thought
to
the
happier
lot
of
men
,
who
are
always
free
*NL*
to
plunge
into
the
healing
waters
of
action
.
Lord
Warburton
of
course
*NL*
spoke
of
the
past
,
but
he
spoke
of
it
without
implications
;
he
even
*NL*
went
so
far
as
to
allude
to
their
former
meeting
in
Rome
as
a
very
jolly
*NL*
time
.
And
he
told
her
he
had
been
immensely
interested
in
hearing
of
her
*NL*
marriage
and
that
it
was
a
great
pleasure
for
him
to
make
Mr.
Osmond
's
*NL*
acquaintance
--
since
he
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
made
it
on
the
other
*NL*
occasion
.
He
had
not
written
to
her
at
the
time
of
that
passage
in
her
*NL*
history
,
but
he
did
n't
apologise
to
her
for
this
.
The
only
thing
he
*NL*
implied
was
that
they
were
old
friends
,
intimate
friends
.
It
was
very
*NL*
much
as
an
intimate
friend
that
he
said
to
her
,
suddenly
,
after
a
short
*NL*
pause
which
he
had
occupied
in
smiling
,
as
he
looked
about
him
,
like
a
*NL*
person
amused
,
at
a
provincial
entertainment
,
by
some
innocent
game
of
*NL*
guesses
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
suppose
you
're
very
happy
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
answered
with
a
quick
laugh
;
the
tone
of
his
remark
struck
her
*NL*
almost
as
the
accent
of
comedy
.
``
Do
you
suppose
if
I
were
not
I
'd
tell
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
I
do
n't
see
why
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
then
.
Fortunately
,
however
,
I
'm
very
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
an
awfully
good
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
very
pleasant
.
But
that
's
not
my
merit
--
it
's
my
husband
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
he
has
arranged
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
nothing
when
we
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
be
very
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
a
genius
for
upholstery
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
great
rage
for
that
sort
of
thing
now
.
But
you
must
have
a
*NL*
taste
of
your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
enjoy
things
when
they
're
done
,
but
I
've
no
ideas
.
I
can
never
*NL*
propose
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
you
accept
what
others
propose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
willingly
,
for
the
most
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
good
thing
to
know
.
I
shall
propose
to
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
very
kind
.
I
must
say
,
however
,
that
I
've
in
a
few
small
*NL*
ways
a
certain
initiative
.
I
should
like
for
instance
to
introduce
you
*NL*
to
some
of
these
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
do
n't
;
I
prefer
sitting
here
.
Unless
it
be
to
that
young
*NL*
lady
in
the
blue
dress
.
She
has
a
charming
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
talking
to
the
rosy
young
man
?
That
's
my
husband
's
daughter
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucky
man
,
your
husband

What
a
dear
little
maid
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
make
her
acquaintance

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
moment
--
with
pleasure
.
I
like
looking
at
her
from
here

''
He
ceased
*NL*
to
look
at
her
,
however
,
very
soon
;
his
eyes
constantly
reverted
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Osmond
.
``
Do
you
know
I
was
wrong
just
now
in
saying
you
had
changed
?
''
he
*NL*
presently
went
on
.
``
You
seem
to
me
,
after
all
,
very
much
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
find
it
a
great
change
to
be
married
,
''
said
Isabel
with
mild
*NL*
gaiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
affects
most
people
more
than
it
has
affected
you
.
You
see
I
have
n't
*NL*
gone
in
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
rather
surprises
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
understand
it
,
Mrs.
Osmond
.
But
I
do
want
to
marry
,
''
he
*NL*
added
more
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ought
to
be
very
easy
,
''
Isabel
said
,
rising
--
after
which
she
*NL*
reflected
,
with
a
pang
perhaps
too
visible
,
that
she
was
hardly
the
*NL*
person
to
say
this
.
It
was
perhaps
because
Lord
Warburton
divined
the
*NL*
pang
that
he
generously
forbore
to
call
her
attention
to
her
not
having
*NL*
contributed
then
to
the
facility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
Rosier
had
meanwhile
seated
himself
on
an
ottoman
beside
Pansy
's
*NL*
tea-table
.
He
pretended
at
first
to
talk
to
her
about
trifles
,
and
she
*NL*
asked
him
who
was
the
new
gentleman
conversing
with
her
stepmother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
an
English
lord
,
''
said
Rosier
.
``
I
do
n't
know
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
he
'll
have
some
tea
.
The
English
are
so
fond
of
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
that
;
I
've
something
particular
to
say
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
so
loud
every
one
will
hear

''
said
Pansy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
hear
if
you
continue
to
look
that
way
:
as
if
your
only
*NL*
thought
in
life
was
the
wish
the
kettle
would
boil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
just
been
filled
;
the
servants
never
know

--
and
she
sighed
with
*NL*
the
weight
of
her
responsibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
your
father
said
to
me
just
now

That
you
did

what
you
said
a
week
ago

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
everything
I
say

How
can
a
young

do
that

I
mean

what
I
say
to
you

*NL*
``
He
told

``
Ah
no

said
Pansy
,
showing
her
pretty
teeth
in
a
fixed
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
everything
's
just
the
very
same
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
no

not
the
very

Papa
has
been
terribly
severe

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
he
done
to
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
asked
me
what
you
had
done
to
me

I
told
him
everything

Then
he

forbade
me
to
marry
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
mind
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes

I
must
indeed

I
ca
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
one
who
loves
you
as
I
do

and
whom
you
pretend
to
love
?

*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
the
lid
of
the
tea-pot
,
gazing
into
this
vessel
for
a
moment
;
*NL*
then
she
dropped
six
words
into
its
aromatic
depths
.
``
I
love
you
just
as
*NL*
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
good
will
that
do
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
Pansy
,
raising
her
sweet
,
vague
eyes
,
``
I
do
n't
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
disappoint
me
,
''
groaned
poor
Rosier
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
a
little
;
she
handed
a
tea-cup
to
a
servant
.
``
Please
*NL*
do
n't
talk
any
more
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
to
be
all
my
satisfaction

*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
said
I
was
not
to
talk
with
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
sacrifice
me
like
that

Ah
,
it
's
too
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
'd
wait
a
little
,
''
said
the
girl
in
a
voice
just
distinct
*NL*
enough
to
betray
a
quaver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
'll
wait
if
you
'll
give
me
hope

But
you
take
my
life
away

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
not
give
you
up

oh
no

Pansy
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
try
and
make
you
marry
some

else

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

What
then
are
we
to

*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
again
.
``
I
'll
speak
to
Mrs.
Osmond
and
she
'll
help
us
.
''
It
*NL*
was
in
this
manner
that
she
for
the
most
part
designated
her
stepmother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wo
n't
help

much

's
afraid

*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
shook
her
little
head
.
``
She
's
not
afraid
of
any
one
.
We
must
have
*NL*
patience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
an
awful
word
,
''
Rosier
groaned
;
he
was
deeply
disconcerted
.
*NL*
Oblivious
of
the
customs
of
good
society
,
he
dropped
his
head
into
his
*NL*
hands
and
,
supporting
it
with
a
melancholy
grace
,
sat
staring
at
the
*NL*
carpet
.
Presently
he
became
aware
of
a
good
deal
of
movement
about
*NL*
him
and
,
as
he
looked
up
,
saw
Pansy
making
a
curtsey
--
it
was
still
her
*NL*
little
curtsey
of
the
convent
--
to
the
English
lord
whom
Mrs.
Osmond
had
*NL*
introduced

CHAPTER
XXXIX
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
probably
not
surprise
the
reflective
reader
that
Ralph
Touchett
*NL*
should
have
seen
less
of
his
cousin
since
her
marriage
than
he
had
done
*NL*
before
that
event
--
an
event
of
which
he
took
such
a
view
as
could
hardly
*NL*
prove
a
confirmation
of
intimacy
.
He
had
uttered
his
thought
,
as
we
*NL*
know
,
and
after
this
had
held
his
peace
,
Isabel
not
having
invited
him
*NL*
to
resume
a
discussion
which
marked
an
era
in
their
relations
.
That
*NL*
discussion
had
made
a
difference
--
the
difference
he
feared
rather
than
*NL*
the
one
he
hoped
.
It
had
not
chilled
the
girl
's
zeal
in
carrying
out
her
*NL*
engagement
,
but
it
had
come
dangerously
near
to
spoiling
a
friendship
.
*NL*
No
reference
was
ever
again
made
between
them
to
Ralph
's
opinion
of
*NL*
Gilbert
Osmond
,
and
by
surrounding
this
topic
with
a
sacred
silence
they
*NL*
managed
to
preserve
a
semblance
of
reciprocal
frankness
.
But
there
was
a
*NL*
difference
,
as
Ralph
often
said
to
himself
--
there
was
a
difference
.
She
*NL*
had
not
forgiven
him
,
she
never
would
forgive
him
:
that
was
all
he
had
*NL*
gained
.
She
thought
she
had
forgiven
him
;
she
believed
she
did
n't
care
;
*NL*
and
as
she
was
both
very
generous
and
very
proud
these
convictions
*NL*
represented
a
certain
reality
.
But
whether
or
no
the
event
should
*NL*
justify
him
he
would
virtually
have
done
her
a
wrong
,
and
the
wrong
was
*NL*
of
the
sort
that
women
remember
best
.
As
Osmond
's
wife
she
could
never
*NL*
again
be
his
friend
.
If
in
this
character
she
should
enjoy
the
felicity
*NL*
she
expected
,
she
would
have
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
man
who
had
*NL*
attempted
,
in
advance
,
to
undermine
a
blessing
so
dear
;
and
if
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
his
warning
should
be
justified
the
vow
she
had
taken
that
he
*NL*
should
never
know
it
would
lay
upon
her
spirit
such
a
burden
as
to
make
*NL*
her
hate
him
.
So
dismal
had
been
,
during
the
year
that
followed
*NL*
his
cousin
's
marriage
,
Ralph
's
prevision
of
the
future
;
and
if
his
*NL*
meditations
appear
morbid
we
must
remember
he
was
not
in
the
bloom
*NL*
of
health
.
He
consoled
himself
as
he
might
by
behaving
-LRB-
as
he
deemed
-RRB-
*NL*
beautifully
,
and
was
present
at
the
ceremony
by
which
Isabel
was
united
*NL*
to
Mr.
Osmond
,
and
which
was
performed
in
Florence
in
the
month
of
*NL*
June
.
He
learned
from
his
mother
that
Isabel
at
first
had
thought
of
*NL*
celebrating
her
nuptials
in
her
native
land
,
but
that
as
simplicity
was
*NL*
what
she
chiefly
desired
to
secure
she
had
finally
decided
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
Osmond
's
professed
willingness
to
make
a
journey
of
any
length
,
that
*NL*
this
characteristic
would
be
best
embodied
in
their
being
married
by
the
*NL*
nearest
clergyman
in
the
shortest
time
.
The
thing
was
done
therefore
at
*NL*
the
little
American
chapel
,
on
a
very
hot
day
,
in
the
presence
only
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
and
her
son
,
of
Pansy
Osmond
and
the
Countess
Gemini
.
That
*NL*
severity
in
the
proceedings
of
which
I
just
spoke
was
in
part
the
result
*NL*
of
the
absence
of
two
persons
who
might
have
been
looked
for
on
the
*NL*
occasion
and
who
would
have
lent
it
a
certain
richness
.
Madame
Merle
*NL*
had
been
invited
,
but
Madame
Merle
,
who
was
unable
to
leave
Rome
,
had
*NL*
written
a
gracious
letter
of
excuses
.
Henrietta
Stackpole
had
not
been
*NL*
invited
,
as
her
departure
from
America
,
announced
to
Isabel
by
Mr.
*NL*
Goodwood
,
was
in
fact
frustrated
by
the
duties
of
her
profession
;
but
*NL*
she
had
sent
a
letter
,
less
gracious
than
Madame
Merle
's
,
intimating
*NL*
that
,
had
she
been
able
to
cross
the
Atlantic
,
she
would
have
been
*NL*
present
not
only
as
a
witness
but
as
a
critic
.
Her
return
to
Europe
had
*NL*
taken
place
somewhat
later
,
and
she
had
effected
a
meeting
with
Isabel
*NL*
in
the
autumn
,
in
Paris
,
when
she
had
indulged
--
perhaps
a
trifle
too
*NL*
freely
--
her
critical
genius
.
Poor
Osmond
,
who
was
chiefly
the
subject
*NL*
of
it
,
had
protested
so
sharply
that
Henrietta
was
obliged
to
declare
to
*NL*
Isabel
that
she
had
taken
a
step
which
put
a
barrier
between
them
.
``
It
*NL*
is
n't
in
the
least
that
you
've
married
--
it
is
that
you
have
married
*NL*
HIM
,
''
she
had
deemed
it
her
duty
to
remark
;
agreeing
,
it
will
be
seen
,
*NL*
much
more
with
Ralph
Touchett
than
she
suspected
,
though
she
had
few
of
*NL*
his
hesitations
and
compunctions
.
Henrietta
's
second
visit
to
Europe
,
*NL*
however
,
was
not
apparently
to
have
been
made
in
vain
;
for
just
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
Osmond
had
declared
to
Isabel
that
he
really
must
object
to
*NL*
that
newspaper-woman
,
and
Isabel
had
answered
that
it
seemed
to
her
he
*NL*
took
Henrietta
too
hard
,
the
good
Mr.
Bantling
had
appeared
upon
*NL*
the
scene
and
proposed
that
they
should
take
a
run
down
to
Spain
.
*NL*
Henrietta
's
letters
from
Spain
had
proved
the
most
acceptable
she
*NL*
had
yet
published
,
and
there
had
been
one
in
especial
,
dated
from
the
*NL*
Alhambra
and
entitled
`
Moors
and
Moonlight
,
'
which
generally
passed
for
*NL*
her
masterpiece
.
Isabel
had
been
secretly
disappointed
at
her
husband
's
*NL*
not
seeing
his
way
simply
to
take
the
poor
girl
for
funny
.
She
even
*NL*
wondered
if
his
sense
of
fun
,
or
of
the
funny
--
which
would
be
his
sense
*NL*
of
humour
,
would
n't
it
?
--
were
by
chance
defective
.
Of
course
she
herself
*NL*
looked
at
the
matter
as
a
person
whose
present
happiness
had
nothing
*NL*
to
grudge
to
Henrietta
's
violated
conscience
.
Osmond
had
thought
their
*NL*
alliance
a
kind
of
monstrosity
;
he
could
n't
imagine
what
they
had
in
*NL*
common
.
For
him
,
Mr.
Bantling
's
fellow
tourist
was
simply
the
most
*NL*
vulgar
of
women
,
and
he
had
also
pronounced
her
the
most
abandoned
.
*NL*
Against
this
latter
clause
of
the
verdict
Isabel
had
appealed
with
an
*NL*
ardour
that
had
made
him
wonder
afresh
at
the
oddity
of
some
of
his
*NL*
wife
's
tastes
.
Isabel
could
explain
it
only
by
saying
that
she
liked
to
*NL*
know
people
who
were
as
different
as
possible
from
herself
.
``
Why
*NL*
then
do
n't
you
make
the
acquaintance
of
your
washerwoman
?
''
Osmond
*NL*
had
enquired
;
to
which
Isabel
had
answered
that
she
was
afraid
her
*NL*
washerwoman
would
n't
care
for
her
.
Now
Henrietta
cared
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
had
seen
nothing
of
her
for
the
greater
part
of
the
two
years
that
*NL*
had
followed
her
marriage
;
the
winter
that
formed
the
beginning
of
her
*NL*
residence
in
Rome
he
had
spent
again
at
San
Remo
,
where
he
had
been
*NL*
joined
in
the
spring
by
his
mother
,
who
afterwards
had
gone
with
him
*NL*
to
England
,
to
see
what
they
were
doing
at
the
bank
--
an
operation
she
*NL*
could
n't
induce
him
to
perform
.
Ralph
had
taken
a
lease
of
his
house
at
*NL*
San
Remo
,
a
small
villa
which
he
had
occupied
still
another
winter
;
but
*NL*
late
in
the
month
of
April
of
this
second
year
he
had
come
down
to
Rome
.
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
that
he
had
stood
face
to
face
*NL*
with
Isabel
;
his
desire
to
see
her
again
was
then
of
the
keenest
.
She
*NL*
had
written
to
him
from
time
to
time
,
but
her
letters
told
him
nothing
*NL*
he
wanted
to
know
.
He
had
asked
his
mother
what
she
was
making
of
her
*NL*
life
,
and
his
mother
had
simply
answered
that
she
supposed
she
was
*NL*
making
the
best
of
it
.
Mrs.
Touchett
had
not
the
imagination
that
*NL*
communes
with
the
unseen
,
and
she
now
pretended
to
no
intimacy
with
*NL*
her
niece
,
whom
she
rarely
encountered
.
This
young
woman
appeared
to
*NL*
be
living
in
a
sufficiently
honourable
way
,
but
Mrs.
Touchett
still
*NL*
remained
of
the
opinion
that
her
marriage
had
been
a
shabby
affair
.
It
*NL*
had
given
her
no
pleasure
to
think
of
Isabel
's
establishment
,
which
she
*NL*
was
sure
was
a
very
lame
business
.
From
time
to
time
,
in
Florence
,
she
*NL*
rubbed
against
the
Countess
Gemini
,
doing
her
best
always
to
minimise
*NL*
the
contact
;
and
the
Countess
reminded
her
of
Osmond
,
who
made
her
*NL*
think
of
Isabel
.
The
Countess
was
less
talked
of
in
these
days
;
but
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
augured
no
good
of
that
:
it
only
proved
how
she
had
been
talked
*NL*
of
before
.
There
was
a
more
direct
suggestion
of
Isabel
in
the
person
*NL*
of
Madame
Merle
;
but
Madame
Merle
's
relations
with
Mrs.
Touchett
had
*NL*
undergone
a
perceptible
change
.
Isabel
's
aunt
had
told
her
,
without
*NL*
circumlocution
,
that
she
had
played
too
ingenious
a
part
;
and
Madame
*NL*
Merle
,
who
never
quarrelled
with
any
one
,
who
appeared
to
think
no
one
*NL*
worth
it
,
and
who
had
performed
the
miracle
of
living
,
more
or
less
,
*NL*
for
several
years
with
Mrs.
Touchett
and
showing
no
symptom
of
*NL*
irritation
--
Madame
Merle
now
took
a
very
high
tone
and
declared
that
*NL*
this
was
an
accusation
from
which
she
could
n't
stoop
to
defend
herself
.
*NL*
She
added
,
however
-LRB-
without
stooping
-RRB-
,
that
her
behaviour
had
been
only
*NL*
too
simple
,
that
she
had
believed
only
what
she
saw
,
that
she
saw
Isabel
*NL*
was
not
eager
to
marry
and
Osmond
not
eager
to
please
-LRB-
his
repeated
*NL*
visits
had
been
nothing
;
he
was
boring
himself
to
death
on
his
hill-top
*NL*
and
he
came
merely
for
amusement
-RRB-
.
Isabel
had
kept
her
sentiments
to
*NL*
herself
,
and
her
journey
to
Greece
and
Egypt
had
effectually
thrown
*NL*
dust
in
her
companion
's
eyes
.
Madame
Merle
accepted
the
event
--
she
was
*NL*
unprepared
to
think
of
it
as
a
scandal
;
but
that
she
had
played
any
part
*NL*
in
it
,
double
or
single
,
was
an
imputation
against
which
she
proudly
*NL*
protested
.
It
was
doubtless
in
consequence
of
Mrs.
Touchett
's
attitude
,
*NL*
and
of
the
injury
it
offered
to
habits
consecrated
by
many
charming
*NL*
seasons
,
that
Madame
Merle
had
,
after
this
,
chosen
to
pass
many
months
*NL*
in
England
,
where
her
credit
was
quite
unimpaired
.
Mrs.
Touchett
had
*NL*
done
her
a
wrong
;
there
are
some
things
that
ca
n't
be
forgiven
.
But
*NL*
Madame
Merle
suffered
in
silence
;
there
was
always
something
exquisite
*NL*
in
her
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
,
as
I
say
,
had
wished
to
see
for
himself
;
but
while
engaged
in
*NL*
this
pursuit
he
had
yet
felt
afresh
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
put
the
*NL*
girl
on
her
guard
.
He
had
played
the
wrong
card
,
and
now
he
had
lost
the
*NL*
game
.
He
should
see
nothing
,
he
should
learn
nothing
;
for
him
she
would
*NL*
always
wear
a
mask
.
His
true
line
would
have
been
to
profess
delight
in
*NL*
her
union
,
so
that
later
,
when
,
as
Ralph
phrased
it
,
the
bottom
should
*NL*
fall
out
of
it
,
she
might
have
the
pleasure
of
saying
to
him
that
he
*NL*
had
been
a
goose
.
He
would
gladly
have
consented
to
pass
for
a
goose
in
*NL*
order
to
know
Isabel
's
real
situation
.
At
present
,
however
,
she
neither
*NL*
taunted
him
with
his
fallacies
nor
pretended
that
her
own
confidence
was
*NL*
justified
;
if
she
wore
a
mask
it
completely
covered
her
face
.
There
was
*NL*
something
fixed
and
mechanical
in
the
serenity
painted
on
it
;
this
was
*NL*
not
an
expression
,
Ralph
said
--
it
was
a
representation
,
it
was
even
an
*NL*
advertisement
.
She
had
lost
her
child
;
that
was
a
sorrow
,
but
it
was
a
*NL*
sorrow
she
scarcely
spoke
of
;
there
was
more
to
say
about
it
than
she
*NL*
could
say
to
Ralph
.
It
belonged
to
the
past
,
moreover
;
it
had
occurred
*NL*
six
months
before
and
she
had
already
laid
aside
the
tokens
of
mourning
.
*NL*
She
appeared
to
be
leading
the
life
of
the
world
;
Ralph
heard
her
spoken
*NL*
of
as
having
a
``
charming
position
.
''
He
observed
that
she
produced
the
*NL*
impression
of
being
peculiarly
enviable
,
that
it
was
supposed
,
among
*NL*
many
people
,
to
be
a
privilege
even
to
know
her
.
Her
house
was
not
open
*NL*
to
every
one
,
and
she
had
an
evening
in
the
week
to
which
people
*NL*
were
not
invited
as
a
matter
of
course
.
She
lived
with
a
certain
*NL*
magnificence
,
but
you
needed
to
be
a
member
of
her
circle
to
perceive
*NL*
it
;
for
there
was
nothing
to
gape
at
,
nothing
to
criticise
,
nothing
even
*NL*
to
admire
,
in
the
daily
proceedings
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Osmond
.
Ralph
,
in
*NL*
all
this
,
recognised
the
hand
of
the
master
;
for
he
knew
that
Isabel
had
*NL*
no
faculty
for
producing
studied
impressions
.
She
struck
him
as
having
*NL*
a
great
love
of
movement
,
of
gaiety
,
of
late
hours
,
of
long
rides
,
of
*NL*
fatigue
;
an
eagerness
to
be
entertained
,
to
be
interested
,
even
to
be
*NL*
bored
,
to
make
acquaintances
,
to
see
people
who
were
talked
about
,
to
*NL*
explore
the
neighbourhood
of
Rome
,
to
enter
into
relation
with
certain
*NL*
of
the
mustiest
relics
of
its
old
society
.
In
all
this
there
was
*NL*
much
less
discrimination
than
in
that
desire
for
comprehensiveness
of
*NL*
development
on
which
he
had
been
used
to
exercise
his
wit
.
There
was
*NL*
a
kind
of
violence
in
some
of
her
impulses
,
of
crudity
in
some
of
her
*NL*
experiments
,
which
took
him
by
surprise
:
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
even
*NL*
spoke
faster
,
moved
faster
,
breathed
faster
,
than
before
her
marriage
.
*NL*
Certainly
she
had
fallen
into
exaggerations
--
she
who
used
to
care
so
*NL*
much
for
the
pure
truth
;
and
whereas
of
old
she
had
a
great
delight
*NL*
in
good-humoured
argument
,
in
intellectual
play
-LRB-
she
never
looked
*NL*
so
charming
as
when
in
the
genial
heat
of
discussion
she
received
a
*NL*
crushing
blow
full
in
the
face
and
brushed
it
away
as
a
feather
-RRB-
,
she
*NL*
appeared
now
to
think
there
was
nothing
worth
people
's
either
differing
*NL*
about
or
agreeing
upon
.
Of
old
she
had
been
curious
,
and
now
she
was
*NL*
indifferent
,
and
yet
in
spite
of
her
indifference
her
activity
was
*NL*
greater
than
ever
.
Slender
still
,
but
lovelier
than
before
,
she
had
*NL*
gained
no
great
maturity
of
aspect
;
yet
there
was
an
amplitude
and
a
*NL*
brilliancy
in
her
personal
arrangements
that
gave
a
touch
of
insolence
*NL*
to
her
beauty
.
Poor
human-hearted
Isabel
,
what
perversity
had
bitten
*NL*
her
?
Her
light
step
drew
a
mass
of
drapery
behind
it
;
her
intelligent
*NL*
head
sustained
a
majesty
of
ornament
.
The
free
,
keen
girl
had
become
*NL*
quite
another
person
;
what
he
saw
was
the
fine
lady
who
was
supposed
to
*NL*
represent
something
.
What
did
Isabel
represent
?
Ralph
asked
himself
;
*NL*
and
he
could
only
answer
by
saying
that
she
represented
Gilbert
Osmond
.
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
,
what
a
function
!
''
he
then
woefully
exclaimed
.
He
was
lost
*NL*
in
wonder
at
the
mystery
of
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
recognised
Osmond
,
as
I
say
;
he
recognised
him
at
every
turn
.
He
*NL*
saw
how
he
kept
all
things
within
limits
;
how
he
adjusted
,
regulated
,
*NL*
animated
their
manner
of
life
.
Osmond
was
in
his
element
;
at
last
he
had
*NL*
material
to
work
with
.
He
always
had
an
eye
to
effect
,
and
his
effects
*NL*
were
deeply
calculated
.
They
were
produced
by
no
vulgar
means
,
but
the
*NL*
motive
was
as
vulgar
as
the
art
was
great
.
To
surround
his
interior
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
invidious
sanctity
,
to
tantalise
society
with
a
sense
*NL*
of
exclusion
,
to
make
people
believe
his
house
was
different
from
every
*NL*
other
,
to
impart
to
the
face
that
he
presented
to
the
world
a
cold
*NL*
originality
--
this
was
the
ingenious
effort
of
the
personage
to
whom
*NL*
Isabel
had
attributed
a
superior
morality
.
``
He
works
with
superior
*NL*
material
,
''
Ralph
said
to
himself
;
``
it
's
rich
abundance
compared
with
his
*NL*
former
resources
.
''
Ralph
was
a
clever
man
;
but
Ralph
had
never
--
to
his
*NL*
own
sense
--
been
so
clever
as
when
he
observed
,
in
petto
,
that
under
the
*NL*
guise
of
caring
only
for
intrinsic
values
Osmond
lived
exclusively
for
*NL*
the
world
.
Far
from
being
its
master
as
he
pretended
to
be
,
he
was
*NL*
its
very
humble
servant
,
and
the
degree
of
its
attention
was
his
only
*NL*
measure
of
success
.
He
lived
with
his
eye
on
it
from
morning
till
night
,
*NL*
and
the
world
was
so
stupid
it
never
suspected
the
trick
.
Everything
*NL*
he
did
was
pose
--
pose
so
subtly
considered
that
if
one
were
not
on
the
*NL*
lookout
one
mistook
it
for
impulse
.
Ralph
had
never
met
a
man
who
lived
*NL*
so
much
in
the
land
of
consideration
.
His
tastes
,
his
studies
,
his
*NL*
accomplishments
,
his
collections
,
were
all
for
a
purpose
.
His
life
on
*NL*
his
hill-top
at
Florence
had
been
the
conscious
attitude
of
years
.
His
*NL*
solitude
,
his
ennui
,
his
love
for
his
daughter
,
his
good
manners
,
his
*NL*
bad
manners
,
were
so
many
features
of
a
mental
image
constantly
present
*NL*
to
him
as
a
model
of
impertinence
and
mystification
.
His
ambition
was
*NL*
not
to
please
the
world
,
but
to
please
himself
by
exciting
the
world
's
*NL*
curiosity
and
then
declining
to
satisfy
it
.
It
had
made
him
feel
great
,
*NL*
ever
,
to
play
the
world
a
trick
.
The
thing
he
had
done
in
his
life
most
*NL*
directly
to
please
himself
was
his
marrying
Miss
Archer
;
though
in
this
*NL*
case
indeed
the
gullible
world
was
in
a
manner
embodied
in
poor
Isabel
,
*NL*
who
had
been
mystified
to
the
top
of
her
bent
.
Ralph
of
course
found
*NL*
a
fitness
in
being
consistent
;
he
had
embraced
a
creed
,
and
as
he
had
*NL*
suffered
for
it
he
could
not
in
honour
forsake
it
.
I
give
this
little
*NL*
sketch
of
its
articles
for
what
they
may
at
the
time
have
been
worth
.
*NL*
It
was
certain
that
he
was
very
skilful
in
fitting
the
facts
to
his
*NL*
theory
--
even
the
fact
that
during
the
month
he
spent
in
Rome
at
this
*NL*
period
the
husband
of
the
woman
he
loved
appeared
to
regard
him
not
in
*NL*
the
least
as
an
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Gilbert
Osmond
Ralph
had
not
now
that
importance
.
It
was
not
that
he
*NL*
had
the
importance
of
a
friend
;
it
was
rather
that
he
had
none
at
all
.
*NL*
He
was
Isabel
's
cousin
and
he
was
rather
unpleasantly
ill
--
it
was
on
*NL*
this
basis
that
Osmond
treated
with
him
.
He
made
the
proper
enquiries
,
*NL*
asked
about
his
health
,
about
Mrs.
Touchett
,
about
his
opinion
of
winter
*NL*
climates
,
whether
he
were
comfortable
at
his
hotel
.
He
addressed
him
,
on
*NL*
the
few
occasions
of
their
meeting
,
not
a
word
that
was
not
necessary
;
*NL*
but
his
manner
had
always
the
urbanity
proper
to
conscious
success
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
conscious
failure
.
For
all
this
,
Ralph
had
had
,
toward
*NL*
the
end
,
a
sharp
inward
vision
of
Osmond
's
making
it
of
small
ease
to
*NL*
his
wife
that
she
should
continue
to
receive
Mr.
Touchett
.
He
was
not
*NL*
jealous
--
he
had
not
that
excuse
;
no
one
could
be
jealous
of
Ralph
.
But
*NL*
he
made
Isabel
pay
for
her
old-time
kindness
,
of
which
so
much
was
*NL*
still
left
;
and
as
Ralph
had
no
idea
of
her
paying
too
much
,
so
when
his
*NL*
suspicion
had
become
sharp
,
he
had
taken
himself
off
.
In
doing
so
he
*NL*
had
deprived
Isabel
of
a
very
interesting
occupation
:
she
had
been
*NL*
constantly
wondering
what
fine
principle
was
keeping
him
alive
.
She
had
*NL*
decided
that
it
was
his
love
of
conversation
;
his
conversation
had
been
*NL*
better
than
ever
.
He
had
given
up
walking
;
he
was
no
longer
a
humorous
*NL*
stroller
.
He
sat
all
day
in
a
chair
--
almost
any
chair
would
serve
,
and
*NL*
was
so
dependent
on
what
you
would
do
for
him
that
,
had
not
his
talk
*NL*
been
highly
contemplative
,
you
might
have
thought
he
was
blind
.
The
*NL*
reader
already
knows
more
about
him
than
Isabel
was
ever
to
know
,
and
*NL*
the
reader
may
therefore
be
given
the
key
to
the
mystery
.
What
kept
*NL*
Ralph
alive
was
simply
the
fact
that
he
had
not
yet
seen
enough
of
*NL*
the
person
in
the
world
in
whom
he
was
most
interested
:
he
was
not
yet
*NL*
satisfied
.
There
was
more
to
come
;
he
could
n't
make
up
his
mind
to
lose
*NL*
that
.
He
wanted
to
see
what
she
would
make
of
her
husband
--
or
what
her
*NL*
husband
would
make
of
her
.
This
was
only
the
first
act
of
the
drama
,
and
*NL*
he
was
determined
to
sit
out
the
performance
.
His
determination
had
held
*NL*
good
;
it
had
kept
him
going
some
eighteen
months
more
,
till
the
time
of
*NL*
his
return
to
Rome
with
Lord
Warburton
.
It
had
given
him
indeed
such
an
*NL*
air
of
intending
to
live
indefinitely
that
Mrs.
Touchett
,
though
more
*NL*
accessible
to
confusions
of
thought
in
the
matter
of
this
strange
,
*NL*
unremunerative
--
and
unremunerated
--
son
of
hers
than
she
had
ever
been
*NL*
before
,
had
,
as
we
have
learned
,
not
scrupled
to
embark
for
a
distant
*NL*
land
.
If
Ralph
had
been
kept
alive
by
suspense
it
was
with
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
the
same
emotion
--
the
excitement
of
wondering
in
what
state
she
*NL*
should
find
him
--
that
Isabel
mounted
to
his
apartment
the
day
after
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
had
notified
her
of
his
arrival
in
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
spent
an
hour
with
him
;
it
was
the
first
of
several
visits
.
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
called
on
him
punctually
,
and
on
their
sending
their
carriage
for
*NL*
him
Ralph
came
more
than
once
to
Palazzo
Roccanera
.
A
fortnight
elapsed
,
*NL*
at
the
end
of
which
Ralph
announced
to
Lord
Warburton
that
he
thought
*NL*
after
all
he
would
n't
go
to
Sicily
.
The
two
men
had
been
dining
together
*NL*
after
a
day
spent
by
the
latter
in
ranging
about
the
Campagna
.
They
had
*NL*
left
the
table
,
and
Warburton
,
before
the
chimney
,
was
lighting
a
cigar
,
*NL*
which
he
instantly
removed
from
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
go
to
Sicily
?
Where
then
will
you
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
guess
I
wo
n't
go
anywhere
,
''
said
Ralph
,
from
the
sofa
,
all
*NL*
shamelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
you
'll
return
to
England
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
no
;
I
'll
stay
in
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rome
wo
n't
do
for
you
.
Rome
's
not
warm
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
have
to
do
.
I
'll
make
it
do
.
See
how
well
I
've
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
looked
at
him
a
while
,
puffing
a
cigar
and
as
if
trying
*NL*
to
see
it
.
``
You
've
been
better
than
you
were
on
the
journey
,
certainly
.
*NL*
I
wonder
how
you
lived
through
that
.
But
I
do
n't
understand
your
*NL*
condition
.
I
recommend
you
to
try
Sicily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
try
,
''
said
poor
Ralph
.
``
I
've
done
trying
.
I
ca
n't
move
further
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
face
that
journey
.
Fancy
me
between
Scylla
and
Charybdis
!
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
die
on
the
Sicilian
plains
--
to
be
snatched
away
,
like
*NL*
Proserpine
in
the
same
locality
,
to
the
Plutonian
shades
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
deuce
then
did
you
come
for
?
''
his
lordship
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
the
idea
took
me
.
I
see
it
wo
n't
do
.
It
really
does
n't
*NL*
matter
where
I
am
now
.
I
've
exhausted
all
remedies
,
I
've
swallowed
*NL*
all
climates
.
As
I
'm
here
I
'll
stay
.
I
have
n't
a
single
cousin
in
*NL*
Sicily
--
much
less
a
married
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
cousin
's
certainly
an
inducement
.
But
what
does
the
doctor
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
asked
him
,
and
I
do
n't
care
a
fig
.
If
I
die
here
Mrs.
Osmond
*NL*
will
bury
me
.
But
I
shall
not
die
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
.
''
Lord
Warburton
continued
to
smoke
reflectively
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
I
must
say
,
''
he
resumed
,
``
for
myself
I
'm
very
glad
you
do
n't
insist
on
*NL*
Sicily
.
I
had
a
horror
of
that
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
for
you
it
need
n't
have
mattered
.
I
had
no
idea
of
dragging
you
*NL*
in
my
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
did
n't
mean
to
let
you
go
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Warburton
,
I
never
expected
you
to
come
further
than
this
,
''
*NL*
Ralph
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
gone
with
you
and
seen
you
settled
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
very
good
Christian
.
You
're
a
very
kind
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
should
have
come
back

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
you
'd
have
gone
to
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
I
should
have
stayed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
said
Ralph
,
``
if
that
's
what
we
are
both
up
to

do

Sicily

''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
was
silent
;
he
sat
staring
at
the
fire
.
At
last
,
looking
*NL*
up
,
``
I
say
,
tell
me
this
,

he
broke
out
;

*NL*
*NL*
``

with

quite

platonically
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

``

been
playing
our
little
game

*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
for

I
made
no
secret
whatever
of
my
desiring

be
here
*NL*
a
while

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
remember
you
said
you
wished

see
the
Minister
of
Foreign
*NL*
Affairs

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
him
three

He

very
amusing

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

you
've
forgotten
what
you
came
for

''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
have
,
''
his
companion
answered
rather
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
were
gentlemen
of
a
race
which
is
not
distinguished
by
the
*NL*
absence
of
reserve
,
and
they
had
travelled
together
from
London
to
Rome
*NL*
without
an
allusion
to
matters
that
were
uppermost
in
the
mind
of
each
.
*NL*
There
was
an
old
subject
they
had
once
discussed
,
but
it
had
lost
its
*NL*
recognised
place
in
their
attention
,
and
even
after
their
arrival
*NL*
in
Rome
,
where
many
things
led
back
to
it
,
they
had
kept
the
same
*NL*
half-diffident
,
half-confident
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
recommend
you
to
get
the
doctor
's
consent

all
the

Lord
*NL*
Warburton
went
on
,
abruptly
,
after
an
interval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

consent

spoil

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Mrs.
Osmond
think

''
Ralph
's
friend
demanded
.
``
I

not

told

She
'll
probably
say
that

go

She

capable

``
In

*NL*

I
do

said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
so
much
already
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
complete
preparation
for
it

Her
going
off
with
me
would
make
*NL*
the
explosion

is
n't
fond
of
his
wife
's
cousin

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
of
course
he
'd
make
a

he
make
a
row

here

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
want
to
see

made
one
the
last

was
in
Rome

then
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
disappear

Now
I
think
it
's
my
duty
to
stop

defend
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Touchett
,
your
defensive
powers

!
''
Lord
Warburton
began
with
*NL*
a
smile
.
But
he
saw
something
in
his
companion
's
face
that
checked
him
.
*NL*
``
Your
duty
,
in
these
premises
,
seems
to
me
rather
a
nice
question
,
''
he
*NL*
observed
instead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
for
a
short
time
answered
nothing
.
``
It
's
true
that
my
defensive
*NL*
powers
are
small
,
''
he
returned
at
last
;
``
but
as
my
aggressive
ones
are
*NL*
still
smaller
Osmond
may
after
all
not
think
me
worth
his
gunpowder
.
At
*NL*
any
rate
,
''
he
added
,
``
there
are
things
I
'm
curious
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
sacrificing
your
health
to
your
curiosity
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
much
interested

my
health

I
'm
deeply
interested

Mrs.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I
.
But
not
as
I
once
was

''
Lord
Warburton
added
quickly
.
This
was
*NL*
one
of
the
allusions
he
had
not
hitherto
found
occasion
to
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
she
strike
you
as
very
happy
?
''
Ralph
enquired
,
emboldened
by
this
*NL*
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
;
I
've
hardly
thought

She
told
me
the
other
night
*NL*

was
happy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
she
told
YOU
,
of
course

Ralph
exclaimed
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that

It
seems
to
me
I
was
rather
the
sort
of
person
she

have
complained
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Complained

She
'll
never
complain

has
done
it

what
she
HAS

knows
it

She
'll
complain
to
you

careful

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
no

said
Lord
Warburton
gravely
;
``
none

*NL*
*NL*
``
Permit
me
to
ask
,

Ralph
went
on
,
``
whether
it
's
to
bring
out
the
fact

you
're
so
very
civil
to
the
*NL*
little
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
gave
a
slight
start
;
he
got
up
and
stood
before
the
fire
,
*NL*
looking
at
it
hard
.
``
Does
that
strike
you
as
very
ridiculous
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ridiculous
?
Not
in
the

,
if
you
really
like
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
her
a
delightful
little

do
n't
know

that

pleased
me
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a

Ah

she
at

is
genuine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
there
's
the
difference
in
our
ages
--
more
than
twenty
years

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Warburton
,
''
said
Ralph
,
``
are
you
serious

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
serious

*NL*
*NL*

I

very
glad

And

''
cried
Ralph
,
``
how
cheered-up
old
*NL*
Osmond
will
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
frowned
.
``
I
say
,
do
n't
spoil
it
.
I
should
n't
propose
for
*NL*
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
have
the
perversity

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
so
fond

said
his
lordship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
that
?
My
dear
Warburton
,
the
drawback
of

is
that

fond
of
you
at
all
to
wish
to
be
connected
with
you

*NL*
Now
,
with
me
in
such
a
case
,
I
should
have
the
happy
confidence
that
*NL*
they
loved
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
seemed
scarcely
in
the
mood
for
doing
justice
to
general
*NL*
axioms
--
he
was
thinking
of
a
special
case
.
``
Do
you
judge
she
'll
be
*NL*
pleased
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
girl
herself
?
Delighted
,
surely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
I
mean
Mrs.
Osmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
looked
at
him
a
moment
.
``
My
dear
fellow
,
what
has
she
to
do
with
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
she
chooses
.
She
's
very
fond
of
Pansy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
--
very
true

''
And
Ralph
slowly
got
up
.
``
It
's
an
interesting
*NL*
question
--
how
far
her
fondness
for
Pansy
will
carry
her
.
''
He
stood
there
*NL*
a
moment
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
rather
a
clouded
brow
.
``
I
*NL*
hope
,
you
know
,
that
you
're
very
--
very
sure

The
deuce

he
broke
off
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

how
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

know
how

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

it
's
awkward

Good

CHAPTER
XL
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
had
not
seen
much
of
Madame
Merle
since
her
marriage
,
this
lady
*NL*
having
indulged
in
frequent
absences
from
Rome
.
At
one
time
she
had
*NL*
spent
six
months
in
England
;
at
another
she
had
passed
a
portion
of
a
*NL*
winter
in
Paris
.
She
had
made
numerous
visits
to
distant
friends
and
*NL*
gave
countenance
to
the
idea
that
for
the
future
she
should
be
a
less
*NL*
inveterate
Roman
than
in
the
past
.
As
she
had
been
inveterate
in
the
*NL*
past
only
in
the
sense
of
constantly
having
an
apartment
in
one
of
*NL*
the
sunniest
niches
of
the
Pincian
--
an
apartment
which
often
stood
*NL*
empty
--
this
suggested
a
prospect
of
almost
constant
absence
;
a
*NL*
danger
which
Isabel
at
one
period
had
been
much
inclined
to
deplore
.
*NL*
Familiarity
had
modified
in
some
degree
her
first
impression
of
Madame
*NL*
Merle
,
but
it
had
not
essentially
altered
it
;
there
was
still
much
*NL*
wonder
of
admiration
in
it
.
That
personage
was
armed
at
all
points
;
it
*NL*
was
a
pleasure
to
see
a
character
so
completely
equipped
for
the
social
*NL*
battle
.
She
carried
her
flag
discreetly
,
but
her
weapons
were
polished
*NL*
steel
,
and
she
used
them
with
a
skill
which
struck
Isabel
as
more
*NL*
and
more
that
of
a
veteran
.
She
was
never
weary
,
never
overcome
with
*NL*
disgust
;
she
never
appeared
to
need
rest
or
consolation
.
She
had
her
own
*NL*
ideas
;
she
had
of
old
exposed
a
great
many
of
them
to
Isabel
,
who
*NL*
knew
also
that
under
an
appearance
of
extreme
self-control
her
*NL*
highly-cultivated
friend
concealed
a
rich
sensibility
.
But
her
will
was
*NL*
mistress
of
her
life
;
there
was
something
gallant
in
the
way
she
kept
*NL*
going
.
It
was
as
if
she
had
learned
the
secret
of
it
--
as
if
the
art
of
*NL*
life
were
some
clever
trick
she
had
guessed
.
Isabel
,
as
she
herself
grew
*NL*
older
,
became
acquainted
with
revulsions
,
with
disgusts
;
there
were
days
*NL*
when
the
world
looked
black
and
she
asked
herself
with
some
sharpness
*NL*
what
it
was
that
she
was
pretending
to
live
for
.
Her
old
habit
had
*NL*
been
to
live
by
enthusiasm
,
to
fall
in
love
with
suddenly-perceived
*NL*
possibilities
,
with
the
idea
of
some
new
adventure
.
As
a
younger
person
*NL*
she
had
been
used
to
proceed
from
one
little
exaltation
to
the
other
:
*NL*
there
were
scarcely
any
dull
places
between
.
But
Madame
Merle
had
*NL*
suppressed
enthusiasm
;
she
fell
in
love
now-a-days
with
nothing
;
she
*NL*
lived
entirely
by
reason
and
by
wisdom
.
There
were
hours
when
Isabel
*NL*
would
have
given
anything
for
lessons
in
this
art
;
if
her
brilliant
*NL*
friend
had
been
near
she
would
have
made
an
appeal
to
her
.
She
had
*NL*
become
aware
more
than
before
of
the
advantage
of
being
like
that
--
of
*NL*
having
made
one
's
self
a
firm
surface
,
a
sort
of
corselet
of
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
I
say
,
it
was
not
till
the
winter
during
which
we
lately
renewed
*NL*
acquaintance
with
our
heroine
that
the
personage
in
question
made
again
*NL*
a
continuous
stay
in
Rome
.
Isabel
now
saw
more
of
her
than
she
had
done
*NL*
since
her
marriage
;
but
by
this
time
Isabel
's
needs
and
inclinations
*NL*
had
considerably
changed
.
It
was
not
at
present
to
Madame
Merle
that
she
*NL*
would
have
applied
for
instruction
;
she
had
lost
the
desire
to
know
this
*NL*
lady
's
clever
trick
.
If
she
had
troubles
she
must
keep
them
to
herself
,
*NL*
and
if
life
was
difficult
it
would
not
make
it
easier
to
confess
herself
*NL*
beaten
.
Madame
Merle
was
doubtless
of
great
use
to
herself
and
an
*NL*
ornament
to
any
circle
;
but
was
she
--
would
she
be
--
of
use
to
others
*NL*
in
periods
of
refined
embarrassment
?
The
best
way
to
profit
by
her
*NL*
friend
--
this
indeed
Isabel
had
always
thought
--
was
to
imitate
her
,
to
be
*NL*
as
firm
and
bright
as
she
.
She
recognised
no
embarrassments
,
and
Isabel
,
*NL*
considering
this
fact
,
determined
for
the
fiftieth
time
to
brush
aside
*NL*
her
own
.
It
seemed
to
her
too
,
on
the
renewal
of
an
intercourse
which
*NL*
had
virtually
been
interrupted
,
that
her
old
ally
was
different
,
was
*NL*
almost
detached
--
pushing
to
the
extreme
a
certain
rather
artificial
fear
*NL*
of
being
indiscreet
.
Ralph
Touchett
,
we
know
,
had
been
of
the
opinion
*NL*
that
she
was
prone
to
exaggeration
,
to
forcing
the
note
--
was
apt
,
in
the
*NL*
vulgar
phrase
,
to
overdo
it
.
Isabel
had
never
admitted
this
charge
--
had
*NL*
never
indeed
quite
understood
it
;
Madame
Merle
's
conduct
,
to
her
*NL*
perception
,
always
bore
the
stamp
of
good
taste
,
was
always
``
quiet
.
''
*NL*
But
in
this
matter
of
not
wishing
to
intrude
upon
the
inner
life
of
the
*NL*
Osmond
family
it
at
last
occurred
to
our
young
woman
that
she
overdid
a
*NL*
little
.
That
of
course
was
not
the
best
taste
;
that
was
rather
violent
.
*NL*
She
remembered
too
much
that
Isabel
was
married
;
that
she
had
now
other
*NL*
interests
;
that
though
she
,
Madame
Merle
,
had
known
Gilbert
Osmond
and
*NL*
his
little
Pansy
very
well
,
better
almost
than
any
one
,
she
was
not
*NL*
after
all
of
the
inner
circle
.
She
was
on
her
guard
;
she
never
spoke
of
*NL*
their
affairs
till
she
was
asked
,
even
pressed
--
as
when
her
opinion
was
*NL*
wanted
;
she
had
a
dread
of
seeming
to
meddle
.
Madame
Merle
was
as
candid
*NL*
as
we
know
,
and
one
day
she
candidly
expressed
this
dread
to
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
MUST
be
on
my
guard
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
might
so
easily
,
without
*NL*
suspecting
it
,
offend
you
.
You
would
be
right
to
be
offended
,
even
if
my
*NL*
intention
should
have
been
of
the
purest
.
I
must
not
forget
that
I
knew
*NL*
your
husband
long
before
you
did
;
I
must
not
let
that
betray
me
.
If
you
*NL*
were
a
silly
woman
you
might
be
jealous
.
You
're
not
a
silly
woman
;
I
*NL*
know
that
perfectly
.
But
neither
am
I
;
therefore
I
'm
determined
not
*NL*
to
get
into
trouble
.
A
little
harm
's
very
soon
done
;
a
mistake
's
made
*NL*
before
one
knows
it
.
Of
course
if
I
had
wished
to
make
love
to
your
*NL*
husband
I
had
ten
years
to
do
it
in
,
and
nothing
to
prevent
;
so
it
is
n't
*NL*
likely
I
shall
begin
to-day
,
when
I
'm
so
much
less
attractive
than
I
*NL*
was
.
But
if
I
were
to
annoy
you
by
seeming
to
take
a
place
that
does
n't
*NL*
belong
to
me
,
you
would
n't
make
that
reflection
;
you
'd
simply
say
I
*NL*
was
forgetting
certain
differences
.
I
'm
determined
not
to
forget
them
.
*NL*
Certainly
a
good
friend
is
n't
always
thinking
of
that
;
one
does
n't
*NL*
suspect
one
's
friends
of
injustice
.
I
do
n't
suspect
you
,
my
dear
,
in
*NL*
the
least
;
but
I
suspect
human
nature
.
Do
n't
think
I
make
myself
*NL*
uncomfortable
;
I
'm
not
always
watching
myself
.
I
think
I
sufficiently
*NL*
prove
it
in
talking
to
you
as
I
do
now
.
All
I
wish
to
say
is
,
however
,
*NL*
that
if
you
were
to
be
jealous
--
that
's
the
form
it
would
take
--
I
should
*NL*
be
sure
to
think
it
was
a
little
my
fault
.
It
certainly
would
n't
be
your
*NL*
husband
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
had
had
three
years
to
think
over
Mrs.
Touchett
's
theory
that
*NL*
Madame
Merle
had
made
Gilbert
Osmond
's
marriage
.
We
know
how
she
had
*NL*
at
first
received
it
.
Madame
Merle
might
have
made
Gilbert
Osmond
's
*NL*
marriage
,
but
she
certainly
had
not
made
Isabel
Archer
's
.
That
was
the
*NL*
work
of
--
Isabel
scarcely
knew
what
:
of
nature
,
providence
,
fortune
,
of
*NL*
the
eternal
mystery
of
things
.
It
was
true
her
aunt
's
complaint
had
*NL*
been
not
so
much
of
Madame
Merle
's
activity
as
of
her
duplicity
:
she
had
*NL*
brought
about
the
strange
event
and
then
she
had
denied
her
guilt
.
Such
*NL*
guilt
would
not
have
been
great
,
to
Isabel
's
mind
;
she
could
n't
make
*NL*
a
crime
of
Madame
Merle
's
having
been
the
producing
cause
of
the
most
*NL*
important
friendship
she
had
ever
formed
.
This
had
occurred
to
her
just
*NL*
before
her
marriage
,
after
her
little
discussion
with
her
aunt
and
at
a
*NL*
time
when
she
was
still
capable
of
that
large
inward
reference
,
the
*NL*
tone
almost
of
the
philosophic
historian
,
to
her
scant
young
annals
.
If
*NL*
Madame
Merle
had
desired
her
change
of
state
she
could
only
say
it
had
*NL*
been
a
very
happy
thought
.
With
her
,
moreover
,
she
had
been
perfectly
*NL*
straightforward
;
she
had
never
concealed
her
high
opinion
of
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
.
After
their
union
Isabel
discovered
that
her
husband
took
a
less
*NL*
convenient
view
of
the
matter
;
he
seldom
consented
to
finger
,
in
talk
,
*NL*
this
roundest
and
smoothest
bead
of
their
social
rosary
.
``
Do
n't
you
like
*NL*
Madame
Merle
?
''
Isabel
had
once
said
to
him
.
``
She
thinks
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
once
for
all
,
''
Osmond
had
answered
.
``
I
liked
her
once
*NL*
better
than
I
do
to-day
.
I
'm
tired
of
her
,
and
I
'm
rather
ashamed
of
it
.
*NL*
She
's
so
almost
unnaturally
good
!
I
'm
glad
she
's
not
in
Italy
;
it
makes
*NL*
for
relaxation
--
for
a
sort
of
moral
detente
.
Do
n't
talk
of
her
too
much
;
*NL*
it
seems
to
bring
her
back
.
She
'll
come
back
in
plenty
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
,
in
fact
,
had
come
back
before
it
was
too
late
--
too
late
,
*NL*
I
mean
,
to
recover
whatever
advantage
she
might
have
lost
.
But
meantime
,
*NL*
if
,
as
I
have
said
,
she
was
sensibly
different
,
Isabel
's
feelings
were
*NL*
also
not
quite
the
same
.
Her
consciousness
of
the
situation
was
as
*NL*
acute
as
of
old
,
but
it
was
much
less
satisfying
.
A
dissatisfied
mind
,
*NL*
whatever
else
it
may
miss
,
is
rarely
in
want
of
reasons
;
they
bloom
as
*NL*
thick
as
buttercups
in
June
.
The
fact
of
Madame
Merle
's
having
had
a
*NL*
hand
in
Gilbert
Osmond
's
marriage
ceased
to
be
one
of
her
titles
to
*NL*
consideration
;
it
might
have
been
written
,
after
all
,
that
there
was
not
*NL*
so
much
to
thank
her
for
.
As
time
went
on
there
was
less
and
less
,
and
*NL*
Isabel
once
said
to
herself
that
perhaps
without
her
these
things
would
*NL*
not
have
been
.
That
reflection
indeed
was
instantly
stifled
;
she
knew
an
*NL*
immediate
horror
at
having
made
it
.
``
Whatever
happens
to
me
let
me
not
*NL*
be
unjust
,
''
she
said
;
``
let
me
bear
my
burdens
myself
and
not
shift
them
*NL*
upon
others
!
''
This
disposition
was
tested
,
eventually
,
by
that
ingenious
*NL*
apology
for
her
present
conduct
which
Madame
Merle
saw
fit
to
make
*NL*
and
of
which
I
have
given
a
sketch
;
for
there
was
something
*NL*
irritating
--
there
was
almost
an
air
of
mockery
--
in
her
neat
*NL*
discriminations
and
clear
convictions
.
In
Isabel
's
mind
to-day
there
*NL*
was
nothing
clear
;
there
was
a
confusion
of
regrets
,
a
complication
of
*NL*
fears
.
She
felt
helpless
as
she
turned
away
from
her
friend
,
who
had
*NL*
just
made
the
statements
I
have
quoted
:
Madame
Merle
knew
so
little
*NL*
what
she
was
thinking
of
!
She
was
herself
moreover
so
unable
to
*NL*
explain
.
Jealous
of
her
--
jealous
of
her
with
Gilbert
?
The
idea
just
then
*NL*
suggested
no
near
reality
.
She
almost
wished
jealousy
had
been
possible
;
*NL*
it
would
have
made
in
a
manner
for
refreshment
.
Was
n't
it
in
a
manner
*NL*
one
of
the
symptoms
of
happiness
?
Madame
Merle
,
however
,
was
wise
,
so
*NL*
wise
that
she
might
have
been
pretending
to
know
Isabel
better
than
*NL*
Isabel
knew
herself
.
This
young
woman
had
always
been
fertile
in
*NL*
resolutions
--
any
of
them
of
an
elevated
character
;
but
at
no
period
had
*NL*
they
flourished
-LRB-
in
the
privacy
of
her
heart
-RRB-
more
richly
than
to-day
.
*NL*
It
is
true
that
they
all
had
a
family
likeness
;
they
might
have
been
*NL*
summed
up
in
the
determination
that
if
she
was
to
be
unhappy
it
should
*NL*
not
be
by
a
fault
of
her
own
.
Her
poor
winged
spirit
had
always
had
*NL*
a
great
desire
to
do
its
best
,
and
it
had
not
as
yet
been
seriously
*NL*
discouraged
.
It
wished
,
therefore
,
to
hold
fast
to
justice
--
not
to
*NL*
pay
itself
by
petty
revenges
.
To
associate
Madame
Merle
with
its
*NL*
disappointment
would
be
a
petty
revenge
--
especially
as
the
pleasure
to
*NL*
be
derived
from
that
would
be
perfectly
insincere
.
It
might
feed
*NL*
her
sense
of
bitterness
,
but
it
would
not
loosen
her
bonds
.
It
was
*NL*
impossible
to
pretend
that
she
had
not
acted
with
her
eyes
open
;
if
ever
*NL*
a
girl
was
a
free
agent
she
had
been
.
A
girl
in
love
was
doubtless
not
a
*NL*
free
agent
;
but
the
sole
source
of
her
mistake
had
been
within
herself
.
*NL*
There
had
been
no
plot
,
no
snare
;
she
had
looked
and
considered
and
*NL*
chosen
.
When
a
woman
had
made
such
a
mistake
,
there
was
only
one
way
to
*NL*
repair
it
--
just
immensely
-LRB-
oh
,
with
the
highest
grandeur
!
-RRB-
to
accept
it
.
*NL*
One
folly
was
enough
,
especially
when
it
was
to
last
for
ever
;
a
second
*NL*
one
would
not
much
set
it
off
.
In
this
vow
of
reticence
there
was
a
*NL*
certain
nobleness
which
kept
Isabel
going
;
but
Madame
Merle
had
been
*NL*
right
,
for
all
that
,
in
taking
her
precautions
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
about
a
month
after
Ralph
Touchett
's
arrival
in
Rome
Isabel
*NL*
came
back
from
a
walk
with
Pansy
.
It
was
not
only
a
part
of
her
general
*NL*
determination
to
be
just
that
she
was
at
present
very
thankful
for
*NL*
Pansy
--
it
was
also
a
part
of
her
tenderness
for
things
that
were
pure
*NL*
and
weak
.
Pansy
was
dear
to
her
,
and
there
was
nothing
else
in
her
*NL*
life
that
had
the
rightness
of
the
young
creature
's
attachment
or
*NL*
the
sweetness
of
her
own
clearness
about
it
.
It
was
like
a
soft
*NL*
presence
--
like
a
small
hand
in
her
own
;
on
Pansy
's
part
it
was
more
than
*NL*
an
affection
--
it
was
a
kind
of
ardent
coercive
faith
.
On
her
own
side
*NL*
her
sense
of
the
girl
's
dependence
was
more
than
a
pleasure
;
it
operated
*NL*
as
a
definite
reason
when
motives
threatened
to
fail
her
.
She
had
said
*NL*
to
herself
that
we
must
take
our
duty
where
we
find
it
,
and
that
we
*NL*
must
look
for
it
as
much
as
possible
.
Pansy
's
sympathy
was
a
direct
*NL*
admonition
;
it
seemed
to
say
that
here
was
an
opportunity
,
not
eminent
*NL*
perhaps
,
but
unmistakeable
.
Yet
an
opportunity
for
what
Isabel
could
*NL*
hardly
have
said
;
in
general
,
to
be
more
for
the
child
than
the
child
*NL*
was
able
to
be
for
herself
.
Isabel
could
have
smiled
,
in
these
days
,
to
*NL*
remember
that
her
little
companion
had
once
been
ambiguous
,
for
she
*NL*
now
perceived
that
Pansy
's
ambiguities
were
simply
her
own
grossness
of
*NL*
vision
.
She
had
been
unable
to
believe
any
one
could
care
so
much
--
so
*NL*
extraordinarily
much
--
to
please
.
But
since
then
she
had
seen
this
*NL*
delicate
faculty
in
operation
,
and
now
she
knew
what
to
think
of
it
.
It
*NL*
was
the
whole
creature
--
it
was
a
sort
of
genius
.
Pansy
had
no
pride
to
*NL*
interfere
with
it
,
and
though
she
was
constantly
extending
her
conquests
*NL*
she
took
no
credit
for
them
.
The
two
were
constantly
together
;
Mrs.
*NL*
Osmond
was
rarely
seen
without
her
stepdaughter
.
Isabel
liked
her
*NL*
company
;
it
had
the
effect
of
one
's
carrying
a
nosegay
composed
all
*NL*
of
the
same
flower
.
And
then
not
to
neglect
Pansy
,
not
under
any
*NL*
provocation
to
neglect
her
--
this
she
had
made
an
article
of
religion
.
*NL*
The
young
girl
had
every
appearance
of
being
happier
in
Isabel
's
society
*NL*
than
in
that
of
any
one
save
her
father
,
--
whom
she
admired
with
an
*NL*
intensity
justified
by
the
fact
that
,
as
paternity
was
an
exquisite
*NL*
pleasure
to
Gilbert
Osmond
,
he
had
always
been
luxuriously
mild
.
Isabel
*NL*
knew
how
Pansy
liked
to
be
with
her
and
how
she
studied
the
means
of
*NL*
pleasing
her
.
She
had
decided
that
the
best
way
of
pleasing
her
was
*NL*
negative
,
and
consisted
in
not
giving
her
trouble
--
a
conviction
which
*NL*
certainly
could
have
had
no
reference
to
trouble
already
existing
.
She
*NL*
was
therefore
ingeniously
passive
and
almost
imaginatively
docile
;
she
*NL*
was
careful
even
to
moderate
the
eagerness
with
which
she
assented
to
*NL*
Isabel
's
propositions
and
which
might
have
implied
that
she
could
have
*NL*
thought
otherwise
.
She
never
interrupted
,
never
asked
social
questions
,
*NL*
and
though
she
delighted
in
approbation
,
to
the
point
of
turning
pale
*NL*
when
it
came
to
her
,
never
held
out
her
hand
for
it
.
She
only
looked
*NL*
toward
it
wistfully
--
an
attitude
which
,
as
she
grew
older
,
made
her
eyes
*NL*
the
prettiest
in
the
world
.
When
during
the
second
winter
at
Palazzo
*NL*
Roccanera
she
began
to
go
to
parties
,
to
dances
,
she
always
,
at
a
*NL*
reasonable
hour
,
lest
Mrs.
Osmond
should
be
tired
,
was
the
first
to
*NL*
propose
departure
.
Isabel
appreciated
the
sacrifice
of
the
late
dances
,
*NL*
for
she
knew
her
little
companion
had
a
passionate
pleasure
in
this
*NL*
exercise
,
taking
her
steps
to
the
music
like
a
conscientious
fairy
.
*NL*
Society
,
moreover
,
had
no
drawbacks
for
her
;
she
liked
even
the
tiresome
*NL*
parts
--
the
heat
of
ball-rooms
,
the
dulness
of
dinners
,
the
crush
at
*NL*
the
door
,
the
awkward
waiting
for
the
carriage
.
During
the
day
,
in
this
*NL*
vehicle
,
beside
her
stepmother
,
she
sat
in
a
small
fixed
,
appreciative
*NL*
posture
,
bending
forward
and
faintly
smiling
,
as
if
she
had
been
taken
*NL*
to
drive
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
I
speak
of
they
had
been
driven
out
of
one
of
the
gates
of
*NL*
the
city
and
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
had
left
the
carriage
to
await
*NL*
them
by
the
roadside
while
they
walked
away
over
the
short
grass
of
the
*NL*
Campagna
,
which
even
in
the
winter
months
is
sprinkled
with
delicate
*NL*
flowers
.
This
was
almost
a
daily
habit
with
Isabel
,
who
was
fond
of
a
*NL*
walk
and
had
a
swift
length
of
step
,
though
not
so
swift
a
one
as
on
her
*NL*
first
coming
to
Europe
.
It
was
not
the
form
of
exercise
that
Pansy
loved
*NL*
best
,
but
she
liked
it
,
because
she
liked
everything
;
and
she
moved
with
*NL*
a
shorter
undulation
beside
her
father
's
wife
,
who
afterwards
,
on
their
*NL*
return
to
Rome
,
paid
a
tribute
to
her
preferences
by
making
the
circuit
*NL*
of
the
Pincian
or
the
Villa
Borghese
.
She
had
gathered
a
handful
of
*NL*
flowers
in
a
sunny
hollow
,
far
from
the
walls
of
Rome
,
and
on
reaching
*NL*
Palazzo
Roccanera
she
went
straight
to
her
room
,
to
put
them
into
*NL*
water
.
Isabel
passed
into
the
drawing-room
,
the
one
she
herself
usually
*NL*
occupied
,
the
second
in
order
from
the
large
ante-chamber
which
was
*NL*
entered
from
the
staircase
and
in
which
even
Gilbert
Osmond
's
rich
*NL*
devices
had
not
been
able
to
correct
a
look
of
rather
grand
nudity
.
Just
*NL*
beyond
the
threshold
of
the
drawing-room
she
stopped
short
,
the
*NL*
reason
for
her
doing
so
being
that
she
had
received
an
impression
.
The
*NL*
impression
had
,
in
strictness
,
nothing
unprecedented
;
but
she
felt
it
as
*NL*
something
new
,
and
the
soundlessness
of
her
step
gave
her
time
to
take
*NL*
in
the
scene
before
she
interrupted
it
.
Madame
Merle
was
there
in
her
*NL*
bonnet
,
and
Gilbert
Osmond
was
talking
to
her
;
for
a
minute
they
were
*NL*
unaware
she
had
come
in
.
Isabel
had
often
seen
that
before
,
certainly
;
*NL*
but
what
she
had
not
seen
,
or
at
least
had
not
noticed
,
was
that
their
*NL*
colloquy
had
for
the
moment
converted
itself
into
a
sort
of
familiar
*NL*
silence
,
from
which
she
instantly
perceived
that
her
entrance
would
*NL*
startle
them
.
Madame
Merle
was
standing
on
the
rug
,
a
little
way
from
*NL*
the
fire
;
Osmond
was
in
a
deep
chair
,
leaning
back
and
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
Her
head
was
erect
,
as
usual
,
but
her
eyes
were
bent
on
his
.
What
struck
*NL*
Isabel
first
was
that
he
was
sitting
while
Madame
Merle
stood
;
there
was
*NL*
an
anomaly
in
this
that
arrested
her
.
Then
she
perceived
that
they
had
*NL*
arrived
at
a
desultory
pause
in
their
exchange
of
ideas
and
were
musing
,
*NL*
face
to
face
,
with
the
freedom
of
old
friends
who
sometimes
exchange
*NL*
ideas
without
uttering
them
.
There
was
nothing
to
shock
in
this
;
they
*NL*
were
old
friends
in
fact
.
But
the
thing
made
an
image
,
lasting
only
a
*NL*
moment
,
like
a
sudden
flicker
of
light
.
Their
relative
positions
,
their
*NL*
absorbed
mutual
gaze
,
struck
her
as
something
detected
.
But
it
was
all
*NL*
over
by
the
time
she
had
fairly
seen
it
.
Madame
Merle
had
seen
her
and
*NL*
had
welcomed
her
without
moving
;
her
husband
,
on
the
other
hand
,
had
*NL*
instantly
jumped
up
.
He
presently
murmured
something
about
wanting
a
*NL*
walk
and
,
after
having
asked
their
visitor
to
excuse
him
,
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
see
you
,
thinking
you
would
have
come
in
;
and
as
you
had
n't
I
*NL*
waited
for
you
,
''
Madame
Merle
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
he
ask
you
to
sit
down
?
''
Isabel
asked
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
looked
about
her
.
``
Ah
,
it
's
very
true
;
I
was
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
stay
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
I
came
for
a
reason
;
I
've
something
on
my
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
told
you
that
before
,
''
Isabel
said
--
``
that
it
takes
something
*NL*
extraordinary
to
bring
you
to
this
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
know
what
I
've
told
YOU
;
that
whether
I
come
or
whether
I
stay
*NL*
away

I
've
always
the
same
motive
--
the
affection
I
bear
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
've
told
me
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
just
now
as
if
you
did
n't
believe
it
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
Isabel
answered
,
``
the
profundity
of
your
motives
,
that
's
the
last
*NL*
thing
I
doubt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
doubt
sooner
of
the
sincerity
of
my
words

''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
shook
her
head
gravely
.
``
I
know
you
've
always
been
kind
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
often
as
you
would
let
me
.
You
do
n't
always
take
it
;
then
one
has
*NL*
to
let
you
alone
.
It
's
not
to
do
you
a
kindness
,
however
,
that
I
've
come
*NL*
to-day
;
it
's
quite
another
affair
.
I
've
come
to
get
rid
of
a
trouble
of
*NL*
my
own
--
to
make
it
over
to
you

I
've
been
talking
to
your
husband
about
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
surprised
at
that
;
he
does
n't
like
troubles

*NL*
*NL*
``
Especially
other
people
's
;
I
know
very
well

neither
do
you

*NL*
suppose

At
any
rate
,
whether
you
do
or
not

you
must
help
me

It
's
*NL*
about
poor
Mr.
Rosier

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Isabel
reflectively
,
``
it
's
his
trouble
then
,
not
yours

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
succeeded
in
saddling
me
with
it

He
comes
to
see
me
ten
times
a
*NL*
week

to
talk
about
Pansy
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
wants
to
marry
her

I
know
all
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
hesitated
.
``
I
gathered
from
your
husband
that
perhaps
you
*NL*
did
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
he
know
what
I
know
?
He
has
never
spoken
to
me
of
the
*NL*
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
probably
because
he
does
n't
know
how
to
speak
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nevertheless
the
sort
of
question
in
which
he
's
rarely
at
fault

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
because
as
a
general

he

perfectly
well
what
to

To-day
he
does
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
been
telling
him
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
gave
a
bright
,
voluntary
smile
.
``
Do
you
know
you
're
a
*NL*
little
dry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
ca
n't

Mr.
Rosier
has
also
talked
to
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
there
's
some
reason

You
're
so
near
the
child

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
for
all
the
comfort
I
've
given
him
!
If
you

dry

I
wonder
what

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

I

connection
he

have
discovered
between

he
came
to

me
from

held
his

Now
he
keeps

coming
back

to
spur
me
up

to
know
what
hope
there
is

to
pour
out
his

feelings

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
very
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

*NL*
*NL*
Madame

dropped
her
eyes
a
moment
.
``
Do
n't
you
think
she
's
*NL*
attractive

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

very
limited

*NL*
``
She
ought

be
all

unlimited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
Isabel
,
``
he
has
about
the
extent

one

*NL*
pocket-handkerchief

the
small
ones
with
lace
borders

Her
humour
had
*NL*
lately
turned
a
good
deal
to
sarcasm
,
but
in
a
moment
she
was
ashamed
*NL*
of
exercising
it
on
so
innocent
an
object
as
Pansy
's
suitor
.
``
He
's
very
*NL*
kind

very
honest

she
presently
added
;
``
and
he
's
not
such
a
fool
as
he
*NL*
seems

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
assures
me
that
she
delights
in
him

said
Madame

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

literal

said
Madame

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
judge
for
myself

*NL*
*NL*
Madame

gave
her
smile
again

It
is
n't
easy
to
help
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

Isabel
very
seriously

What
do
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
easy

displease
you

you
see

I
notify
you
,
at
any
rate

I
notified
Osmond
,

the
love-affairs
of

added
Madame

,
*NL*
``
as
I
do
n't
think
him
a
paragon
of
husbands

*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
reflected
a
little
;
after
which
,
with
a
smile
,
``
You
do
n't
wash
*NL*
your
hands
then
!
''
she
said
.
After
which
again
she
added
in
another
tone
:
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
--
you
're
too
much
interested

''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
slowly
rose
;
she
had
given
Isabel
a
look
as
rapid
as
the
*NL*
intimation
that
had
gleamed
before
our
heroine
a
few
moments
before
.
*NL*
Only
this
time
the
latter
saw
nothing
.
``
Ask
him
the
next
time
,
and
*NL*
you
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
ask
him
;
he
has
ceased
to
come
to
the
house

Gilbert
has
let
*NL*
him
know
that
he
's
not
welcome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
,
``
I
forgot
that
--
though
it
's
the
burden
of
*NL*
his
lamentation

He
says
Osmond
has
insulted
him
.
All
the
same
,
''
she
*NL*
went
on
,
``
Osmond
does
n't
dislike
him
so
much
as
he
thinks
.
''
She
had
got
*NL*
up
as
if
to
close
the
conversation
,
but
she
lingered
,
looking
about
her
,
*NL*
and
had
evidently
more
to
say
.
Isabel
perceived
this
and
even
saw
the
*NL*
point
she
had
in
view
;
but
Isabel
also
had
her
own
reasons
for
not
*NL*
opening
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
have
pleased
him

you
've
told

she
answered

smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
've
told
him

as
far
as
that
goes
I
've
encouraged
him

I
've

preached
patience

have
said
that
his
case
is
n't
desperate
if
he
'll
only
*NL*
hold
his
tongue
and
be
quiet

Unfortunately
he
has
taken
it
into
his
*NL*
head
to
be
jealous

*NL*
*NL*
``
Jealous
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jealous

Lord
Warburton

he
says

here

*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
,
who
was
tired
,
had
remained
sitting
;
but
at
this
she
also
rose
.
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
exclaimed
simply
,
moving
slowly
to
the
fireplace
.
Madame
*NL*
Merle
observed
her
as
she
passed
and
while
she
stood
a
moment
before
the
*NL*
mantel-glass
and
pushed
into
its
place
a
wandering
tress
of
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Madame

went
on

Isabel

was
silent
a
little
;
she
turned
away
from
the
glass
.
``
It
's
true

she
returned
at

,
gravely

more
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

Madame

added
,

you
've
had
infinitely
more
observation

behaviour

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
no

Madame

gave
one
of

quick
looks
again

This
observation

immediate

precipitate

almost
burst
from
Madame

lips

*NL*
*NL*
Isabel

eyes
rested
on

Madame

instantly
became
conscious
that

had
spoken
more
quickly

the
reflection
brought
the
colour
to
her
cheek

She
gave
*NL*
the
treacherous
impulse
time
to
subside

then
said
as

been

it
over
a
little
:

Madame

stared
,

indeed
she
was
justly
bewildered

gathering

together
Madame

prepared

She
was
checked

'll
ask
her
.
Especially
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
*NL*
in
a
moment
,
``
if
you
make
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
make
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
quite
in
your
power
.
You
've
great
influence
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
frowned
a
little
.
``
Where
did
you
learn
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Touchett
told
me
.
Not
you
--
never
!
''
said
Madame
Merle
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
never
told
you
anything
of
the
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
MIGHT
have
done
so
--
so
far
as
opportunity
went
--
when
we
were
by
*NL*
way
of
being
confidential
with
each
other
.
But
you
really
told
me
very
*NL*
little
;
I
've
often
thought
so
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
had
thought
so
too
,
and
sometimes
with
a
certain
satisfaction
.
*NL*
But
she
did
n't
admit
it
now
--
perhaps
because
she
wished
not
to
appear
to
*NL*
exult
in
it
.
``
You
seem
to
have
had
an
excellent
informant
in
my
aunt
,
''
*NL*
she
simply
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
let
me
know
you
had
declined
an
offer
of
marriage
from
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
,
because
she
was
greatly
vexed
and
was
full
of
the
subject
.
*NL*
Of
course
I
think
you
've
done
better
in
doing
as
you
did
.
But
if
you
*NL*
would
n't
marry
Lord
Warburton
yourself
,
make
him
the
reparation
of
*NL*
helping
him
to
marry
some
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
listened
to
this
with
a
face
that
persisted
in
not
reflecting
*NL*
the
bright
expressiveness
of
Madame
Merle
's
.
But
in
a
moment
she
said
,
*NL*
reasonably
and
gently
enough
:
``
I
should
be
very
glad
indeed
if
,
as
*NL*
regards
Pansy
,
it
could
be
arranged
.
''
Upon
which
her
companion
,
who
*NL*
seemed
to
regard
this
as
a
speech
of
good
omen
,
embraced
her
more
*NL*
tenderly
than
might
have
been
expected
and
triumphantly
withdrew
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
XLI
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
touched
on
this
matter
that
evening
for
the
first
time
;
coming
*NL*
very
late
into
the
drawing-room
,
where
she
was
sitting
alone
.
They
had
*NL*
spent
the
evening
at
home
,
and
Pansy
had
gone
to
bed
;
he
himself
had
*NL*
been
sitting
since
dinner
in
a
small
apartment
in
which
he
had
arranged
*NL*
his
books
and
which
he
called
his
study
.
At
ten
o'clock
Lord
Warburton
*NL*
had
come
in
,
as
he
always
did
when
he
knew
from
Isabel
that
she
was
to
*NL*
be
at
home
;
he
was
going
somewhere
else
and
he
sat
for
half
an
hour
.
*NL*
Isabel
,
after
asking
him
for
news
of
Ralph
,
said
very
little
to
him
,
on
*NL*
purpose
;
she
wished
him
to
talk
with
her
stepdaughter
.
She
pretended
to
*NL*
read
;
she
even
went
after
a
little
to
the
piano
;
she
asked
herself
if
*NL*
she
might
n't
leave
the
room
.
She
had
come
little
by
little
to
think
*NL*
well
of
the
idea
of
Pansy
's
becoming
the
wife
of
the
master
of
beautiful
*NL*
Lockleigh
,
though
at
first
it
had
not
presented
itself
in
a
manner
to
*NL*
excite
her
enthusiasm
.
Madame
Merle
,
that
afternoon
,
had
applied
the
*NL*
match
to
an
accumulation
of
inflammable
material
.
When
Isabel
was
*NL*
unhappy
she
always
looked
about
her
--
partly
from
impulse
and
partly
by
*NL*
theory
--
for
some
form
of
positive
exertion
.
She
could
never
rid
herself
*NL*
of
the
sense
that
unhappiness
was
a
state
of
disease
--
of
suffering
as
*NL*
opposed
to
doing
.
To
``
do
''
--
it
hardly
mattered
what
--
would
therefore
*NL*
be
an
escape
,
perhaps
in
some
degree
a
remedy
.
Besides
,
she
wished
to
*NL*
convince
herself
that
she
had
done
everything
possible
to
content
her
*NL*
husband
;
she
was
determined
not
to
be
haunted
by
visions
of
his
wife
's
*NL*
limpness
under
appeal
.
It
would
please
him
greatly
to
see
Pansy
married
*NL*
to
an
English
nobleman
,
and
justly
please
him
,
since
this
nobleman
was
*NL*
so
sound
a
character
.
It
seemed
to
Isabel
that
if
she
could
make
it
her
*NL*
duty
to
bring
about
such
an
event
she
should
play
the
part
of
a
good
*NL*
wife
.
She
wanted
to
be
that
;
she
wanted
to
be
able
to
believe
sincerely
,
*NL*
and
with
proof
of
it
,
that
she
had
been
that
.
Then
such
an
undertaking
*NL*
had
other
recommendations
.
It
would
occupy
her
,
and
she
desired
*NL*
occupation
.
It
would
even
amuse
her
,
and
if
she
could
really
amuse
*NL*
herself
she
perhaps
might
be
saved
.
Lastly
,
it
would
be
a
service
to
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
,
who
evidently
pleased
himself
greatly
with
the
charming
*NL*
girl
.
It
was
a
little
``
weird
''
he
should
--
being
what
he
was
;
but
there
*NL*
was
no
accounting
for
such
impressions
.
Pansy
might
captivate
any
*NL*
one
--
any
one
at
least
but
Lord
Warburton
.
Isabel
would
have
thought
her
*NL*
too
small
,
too
slight
,
perhaps
even
too
artificial
for
that
.
There
was
*NL*
always
a
little
of
the
doll
about
her
,
and
that
was
not
what
he
had
been
*NL*
looking
for
.
Still
,
who
could
say
what
men
ever
were
looking
for
?
They
*NL*
looked
for
what
they
found
;
they
knew
what
pleased
them
only
when
*NL*
they
saw
it
.
No
theory
was
valid
in
such
matters
,
and
nothing
was
more
*NL*
unaccountable
or
more
natural
than
anything
else
.
If
he
had
cared
for
*NL*
HER
it
might
seem
odd
he
should
care
for
Pansy
,
who
was
so
different
;
*NL*
but
he
had
not
cared
for
her
so
much
as
he
had
supposed
.
Or
if
he
had
,
*NL*
he
had
completely
got
over
it
,
and
it
was
natural
that
,
as
that
affair
*NL*
had
failed
,
he
should
think
something
of
quite
another
sort
might
*NL*
succeed
.
Enthusiasm
,
as
I
say
,
had
not
come
at
first
to
Isabel
,
but
*NL*
it
came
to-day
and
made
her
feel
almost
happy
.
It
was
astonishing
what
*NL*
happiness
she
could
still
find
in
the
idea
of
procuring
a
pleasure
for
*NL*
her
husband
.
It
was
a
pity
,
however
,
that
Edward
Rosier
had
crossed
*NL*
their
path
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
reflection
the
light
that
had
suddenly
gleamed
upon
that
path
*NL*
lost
something
of
its
brightness
.
Isabel
was
unfortunately
as
sure
that
*NL*
Pansy
thought
Mr.
Rosier
the
nicest
of
all
the
young
men
--
as
sure
as
if
*NL*
she
had
held
an
interview
with
her
on
the
subject
.
It
was
very
tiresome
*NL*
she
should
be
so
sure
,
when
she
had
carefully
abstained
from
informing
*NL*
herself
;
almost
as
tiresome
as
that
poor
Mr.
Rosier
should
have
taken
it
*NL*
into
his
own
head
.
He
was
certainly
very
inferior
to
Lord
Warburton
.
It
*NL*
was
not
the
difference
in
fortune
so
much
as
the
difference
in
the
men
;
*NL*
the
young
American
was
really
so
light
a
weight
.
He
was
much
more
of
*NL*
the
type
of
the
useless
fine
gentleman
than
the
English
nobleman
.
It
*NL*
was
true
that
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
Pansy
should
marry
a
*NL*
statesman
;
still
,
if
a
statesman
admired
her
,
that
was
his
affair
,
and
*NL*
she
would
make
a
perfect
little
pearl
of
a
peeress
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
seem
to
the
reader
that
Mrs.
Osmond
had
grown
of
a
sudden
*NL*
strangely
cynical
,
for
she
ended
by
saying
to
herself
that
this
*NL*
difficulty
could
probably
be
arranged
.
An
impediment
that
was
embodied
*NL*
in
poor
Rosier
could
not
anyhow
present
itself
as
a
dangerous
one
;
there
*NL*
were
always
means
of
levelling
secondary
obstacles
.
Isabel
was
perfectly
*NL*
aware
that
she
had
not
taken
the
measure
of
Pansy
's
tenacity
,
which
*NL*
might
prove
to
be
inconveniently
great
;
but
she
inclined
to
see
her
*NL*
as
rather
letting
go
,
under
suggestion
,
than
as
clutching
under
*NL*
deprecation
--
since
she
had
certainly
the
faculty
of
assent
developed
in
*NL*
a
very
much
higher
degree
than
that
of
protest
.
She
would
cling
,
yes
,
*NL*
she
would
cling
;
but
it
really
mattered
to
her
very
little
what
she
*NL*
clung
to
.
Lord
Warburton
would
do
as
well
as
Mr.
Rosier
--
especially
as
*NL*
she
seemed
quite
to
like
him
;
she
had
expressed
this
sentiment
to
Isabel
*NL*
without
a
single
reservation
;
she
had
said
she
thought
his
conversation
*NL*
most
interesting
--
he
had
told
her
all
about
India
.
His
manner
to
Pansy
*NL*
had
been
of
the
rightest
and
easiest
--
Isabel
noticed
that
for
herself
,
*NL*
as
she
also
observed
that
he
talked
to
her
not
in
the
least
in
a
*NL*
patronising
way
,
reminding
himself
of
her
youth
and
simplicity
,
but
*NL*
quite
as
if
she
understood
his
subjects
with
that
sufficiency
with
which
*NL*
she
followed
those
of
the
fashionable
operas
.
This
went
far
enough
*NL*
for
attention
to
the
music
and
the
barytone
.
He
was
careful
only
to
be
*NL*
kind
--
he
was
as
kind
as
he
had
been
to
another
fluttered
young
chit
at
*NL*
Gardencourt
.
A
girl
might
well
be
touched
by
that
;
she
remembered
how
*NL*
she
herself
had
been
touched
,
and
said
to
herself
that
if
she
had
been
*NL*
as
simple
as
Pansy
the
impression
would
have
been
deeper
still
.
She
*NL*
had
not
been
simple
when
she
refused
him
;
that
operation
had
been
*NL*
as
complicated
as
,
later
,
her
acceptance
of
Osmond
had
been
.
Pansy
,
*NL*
however
,
in
spite
of
HER
simplicity
,
really
did
understand
,
and
was
*NL*
glad
that
Lord
Warburton
should
talk
to
her
,
not
about
her
partners
and
*NL*
bouquets
,
but
about
the
state
of
Italy
,
the
condition
of
the
peasantry
,
*NL*
the
famous
grist-tax
,
the
pellagra
,
his
impressions
of
Roman
society
.
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
as
she
drew
her
needle
through
her
tapestry
,
with
*NL*
sweet
submissive
eyes
,
and
when
she
lowered
them
she
gave
little
quiet
*NL*
oblique
glances
at
his
person
,
his
hands
,
his
feet
,
his
clothes
,
as
if
*NL*
she
were
considering
him
.
Even
his
person
,
Isabel
might
have
reminded
*NL*
her
,
was
better
than
Mr.
Rosier
's
.
But
Isabel
contented
herself
at
such
*NL*
moments
with
wondering
where
this
gentleman
was
;
he
came
no
more
at
all
*NL*
to
Palazzo
Roccanera
.
It
was
surprising
,
as
I
say
,
the
hold
it
had
taken
*NL*
of
her
--
the
idea
of
assisting
her
husband
to
be
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
surprising
for
a
variety
of
reasons
which
I
shall
presently
touch
*NL*
upon
.
On
the
evening
I
speak
of
,
while
Lord
Warburton
sat
there
,
she
had
*NL*
been
on
the
point
of
taking
the
great
step
of
going
out
of
the
room
and
*NL*
leaving
her
companions
alone
.
I
say
the
great
step
,
because
it
was
in
*NL*
this
light
that
Gilbert
Osmond
would
have
regarded
it
,
and
Isabel
was
*NL*
trying
as
much
as
possible
to
take
her
husband
's
view
.
She
succeeded
*NL*
after
a
fashion
,
but
she
fell
short
of
the
point
I
mention
.
After
all
*NL*
she
could
n't
rise
to
it
;
something
held
her
and
made
this
impossible
.
*NL*
It
was
not
exactly
that
it
would
be
base
or
insidious
;
for
women
as
a
*NL*
general
thing
practise
such
manoeuvres
with
a
perfectly
good
conscience
,
*NL*
and
Isabel
was
instinctively
much
more
true
than
false
to
the
common
*NL*
genius
of
her
sex
.
There
was
a
vague
doubt
that
interposed
--
a
sense
that
*NL*
she
was
not
quite
sure
.
So
she
remained
in
the
drawing-room
,
and
after
a
*NL*
while
Lord
Warburton
went
off
to
his
party
,
of
which
he
promised
to
give
*NL*
Pansy
a
full
account
on
the
morrow
.
After
he
had
gone
she
wondered
*NL*
if
she
had
prevented
something
which
would
have
happened
if
she
*NL*
had
absented
herself
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
then
she
*NL*
pronounced
--
always
mentally
--
that
when
their
distinguished
visitor
*NL*
should
wish
her
to
go
away
he
would
easily
find
means
to
let
her
know
*NL*
it
.
Pansy
said
nothing
whatever
about
him
after
he
had
gone
,
and
Isabel
*NL*
studiously
said
nothing
,
as
she
had
taken
a
vow
of
reserve
until
after
*NL*
he
should
have
declared
himself
.
He
was
a
little
longer
in
coming
to
*NL*
this
than
might
seem
to
accord
with
the
description
he
had
given
Isabel
*NL*
of
his
feelings
.
Pansy
went
to
bed
,
and
Isabel
had
to
admit
that
*NL*
she
could
not
now
guess
what
her
stepdaughter
was
thinking
of
.
Her
*NL*
transparent
little
companion
was
for
the
moment
not
to
be
seen
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
alone
,
looking
at
the
fire
,
until
,
at
the
end
of
half
an
*NL*
hour
,
her
husband
came
in
.
He
moved
about
a
while
in
silence
and
*NL*
then
sat
down
;
he
looked
at
the
fire
like
herself
.
But
she
now
had
*NL*
transferred
her
eyes
from
the
flickering
flame
in
the
chimney
to
*NL*
Osmond
's
face
,
and
she
watched
him
while
he
kept
his
silence
.
Covert
*NL*
observation
had
become
a
habit
with
her
;
an
instinct
,
of
which
it
is
not
*NL*
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
it
was
allied
to
that
of
self-defence
,
had
*NL*
made
it
habitual
.
She
wished
as
much
as
possible
to
know
his
thoughts
,
*NL*
to
know
what
he
would
say
,
beforehand
,
so
that
she
might
prepare
her
*NL*
answer
.
Preparing
answers
had
not
been
her
strong
point
of
old
;
she
had
*NL*
rarely
in
this
respect
got
further
than
thinking
afterwards
of
clever
*NL*
things
she
might
have
said
.
But
she
had
learned
caution
--
learned
it
in
*NL*
a
measure
from
her
husband
's
very
countenance
.
It
was
the
same
face
she
*NL*
had
looked
into
with
eyes
equally
earnest
perhaps
,
but
less
penetrating
,
*NL*
on
the
terrace
of
a
Florentine
villa
;
except
that
Osmond
had
grown
*NL*
slightly
stouter
since
his
marriage
.
He
still
,
however
,
might
strike
one
*NL*
as
very
distinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Lord
Warburton
been
here
?
''
he
presently
asked

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
stayed
half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
see
Pansy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
sat
on
the
sofa
beside
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
talk
with
her
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
talked
almost
only
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
he
's
attentive
.
Is
n't
that
what
you
call
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
call
it
anything
,
''
said
Isabel
;
``
I
've
waited
for
you
to
give
it
*NL*
a
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
consideration
you
do
n't
always
show
,
''
Osmond
answered
after
a
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
determined
,
this
time
,
to
try
and
act
as
you
'd
like
.
I
've
so
often
*NL*
failed
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
turned
his
head
slowly
,
looking
at
her
.
``
Are
you
trying
to
*NL*
quarrel
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
trying
to
live
at
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
's
more
easy
;
you
know
I
do
n't
quarrel
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call
it
when
you
try
to
make
me
angry
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
try
;
if
I
've
done
so
it
has
been
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
*NL*
world
.
Moreover
I
'm
not
in
the
least
trying
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
smiled
.
``
It
does
n't
matter
.
I
've
determined
never
to
be
angry
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
an
excellent
resolve
.
Your
temper
is
n't
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
it
's
not
good
.
''
She
pushed
away
the
book
she
had
been
reading
and
*NL*
took
up
the
band
of
tapestry
Pansy
had
left
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
partly
why
I
've
not
spoken
to
you
about
this
business
of
my
*NL*
daughter
's
,
''
Osmond
said
,
designating
Pansy
in
the
manner
that
was
most
*NL*
frequent
with
him
.
``
I
was
afraid
I
should
encounter
opposition
--
that
you
*NL*
too
would
have
views
on
the
subject
.
I
've
sent
little
Rosier
about
his
*NL*
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
afraid
I
'd
plead
for
Mr.
Rosier
?
Have
n't
you
noticed
that
I
've
*NL*
never
spoken
to
you
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
given
you
a
chance
.
We
've
so
little
conversation
in
these
*NL*
days
.
I
know
he
was
an
old
friend
of
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
's
an
old
friend
of
mine
.
''
Isabel
cared
little
more
for
him
than
*NL*
for
the
tapestry
that
she
held
in
her
hand
;
but
it
was
true
that
he
*NL*
was
an
old
friend
and
that
with
her
husband
she
felt
a
desire
not
to
*NL*
extenuate
such
ties
.
He
had
a
way
of
expressing
contempt
for
them
which
*NL*
fortified
her
loyalty
to
them
,
even
when
,
as
in
the
present
case
,
they
*NL*
were
in
themselves
insignificant
.
She
sometimes
felt
a
sort
of
passion
*NL*
of
tenderness
for
memories
which
had
no
other
merit
than
that
they
*NL*
belonged
to
her
unmarried
life
.
``
But
as
regards
Pansy
,
''
she
added
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
``
I
've
given
him
no
encouragement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
fortunate
,
''
Osmond
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortunate
for
me
,
I
suppose
you
mean
.
For
him
it
matters
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
use
talking
of
him
,
''
Osmond
said
.
``
As
I
tell
you
,
I
've
*NL*
turned
him
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
a
lover
outside
's
always
a
lover
.
He
's
sometimes
even
more
of
*NL*
one
.
Mr.
Rosier
still
has
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
welcome
to
the
comfort
of
it
!
My
daughter
has
only
to
sit
*NL*
perfectly
quiet
to
become
Lady
Warburton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
like
that
?
''
Isabel
asked
with
a
simplicity
which
was
not
*NL*
so
affected
as
it
may
appear
.
She
was
resolved
to
assume
nothing
,
for
*NL*
Osmond
had
a
way
of
unexpectedly
turning
her
assumptions
against
her
.
*NL*
The
intensity
with
which
he
would
like
his
daughter
to
become
Lady
*NL*
Warburton
had
been
the
very
basis
of
her
own
recent
reflections
.
But
*NL*
that
was
for
herself
;
she
would
recognise
nothing
until
Osmond
should
*NL*
have
put
it
into
words
;
she
would
not
take
for
granted
with
him
that
*NL*
he
thought
Lord
Warburton
a
prize
worth
an
amount
of
effort
that
was
*NL*
unusual
among
the
Osmonds
.
It
was
Gilbert
's
constant
intimation
that
for
*NL*
him
nothing
in
life
was
a
prize
;
that
he
treated
as
from
equal
to
equal
*NL*
with
the
most
distinguished
people
in
the
world
,
and
that
his
daughter
*NL*
had
only
to
look
about
her
to
pick
out
a
prince
.
It
cost
him
therefore
*NL*
a
lapse
from
consistency
to
say
explicitly
that
he
yearned
for
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
and
that
if
this
nobleman
should
escape
his
equivalent
might
*NL*
not
be
found
;
with
which
moreover
it
was
another
of
his
customary
*NL*
implications
that
he
was
never
inconsistent
.
He
would
have
liked
his
*NL*
wife
to
glide
over
the
point
.
But
strangely
enough
,
now
that
she
*NL*
was
face
to
face
with
him
and
although
an
hour
before
she
had
almost
*NL*
invented
a
scheme
for
pleasing
him
,
Isabel
was
not
accommodating
,
*NL*
would
not
glide
.
And
yet
she
knew
exactly
the
effect
on
his
mind
of
*NL*
her
question
:
it
would
operate
as
an
humiliation
.
Never
mind
;
he
was
*NL*
terribly
capable
of
humiliating
her
--
all
the
more
so
that
he
was
also
*NL*
capable
of
waiting
for
great
opportunities
and
of
showing
sometimes
an
*NL*
almost
unaccountable
indifference
to
small
ones
.
Isabel
perhaps
took
a
*NL*
small
opportunity
because
she
would
not
have
availed
herself
of
a
great
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
at
present
acquitted
himself
very
honourably
.
``
I
should
like
it
*NL*
extremely
;
it
would
be
a
great
marriage
.
And
then
Lord
Warburton
has
*NL*
another
advantage
:
he
's
an
old
friend
of
yours
.
It
would
be
pleasant
for
*NL*
him
to
come
into
the
family
.
It
's
very
odd
Pansy
's
admirers
should
all
*NL*
be
your
old
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
natural
that
they
should
come
to
see
me
.
In
coming
to
see
me
they
*NL*
see
Pansy
.
Seeing
her
it
's
natural
they
should
fall
in
love
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
think
.
But
you
're
not
bound
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
should
marry
Lord
Warburton
I
should
be
very
glad
,
''
Isabel
went
*NL*
on
frankly
.
``
He
's
an
excellent
man
.
You
say
,
however
,
that
she
has
only
*NL*
to
sit
perfectly
still

Perhaps
she
wo
n't
sit
perfectly
still
.
If
she
*NL*
loses
Mr.
Rosier
she
may
jump
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
appeared
to
give
no
heed
to
this
;
he
sat
gazing
at
the
fire
.
*NL*
``
Pansy
would
like
to
be
a
great
lady
,
''
he
remarked
in
a
moment
with
a
*NL*
certain
tenderness
of
tone
.
``
She
wishes
above
all
to
please
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
please
Mr.
Rosier
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
to
please
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
too
a
little
,
I
think
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
has
a
great
opinion
of
you
.
But
she
'll
do
what
I
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
're
sure
of
that
,
it
's
very
well
,
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meantime
,
''
said
Osmond
,
``
I
should
like
our
distinguished
visitor
to
*NL*
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
spoken

to
me

He
has
told
me
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
*NL*
him
to
believe
she
could
care
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
turned
his
head
quickly
,
but
at
first
he
said
nothing
.
Then
,
``
Why
*NL*
did
n't
you
tell
me
that
?
''
he
asked
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
no
opportunity
.
You
know
how
we
live
.
I
've
taken
the
first
*NL*
chance
that
has
offered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
speak
to
him
of
Rosier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
hardly
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
best
he
should
know
,
so
that
,
so
that
--
''
And
Isabel
*NL*
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
he
might
act
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
he
might
back
out
,
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
so
that
he
might
advance
while
there
's
yet
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
the
effect
it
seems
to
have
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
patience
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
You
know
Englishmen
are
shy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
one
's
not
.
He
was
not
when
he
made
love
to
YOU
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
afraid
Osmond
would
speak
of
that
;
it
was
disagreeable
to
*NL*
her
.
``
I
beg
your
pardon
;
he
was
extremely
so
,
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
nothing
for
some
time
;
he
took
up
a
book
and
fingered
the
*NL*
pages
while
she
sat
silent
and
occupied
herself
with
Pansy
's
tapestry
.
*NL*
``
You
must
have
a
great
deal
of
influence
with
him
,
''
Osmond
went
on
at
*NL*
last
.
``
The
moment
you
really
wish
it
you
can
bring
him
to
the
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
more
offensive
still
;
but
she
felt
the
great
naturalness
of
*NL*
his
saying
it
,
and
it
was
after
all
extremely
like
what
she
had
said
*NL*
to
herself
.
``
Why
should
I
have
influence
?
''
she
asked
.
``
What
have
I
ever
*NL*
done
to
put
him
under
an
obligation
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
refused
to
marry
him
,
''
said
Osmond
with
his
eyes
on
his
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
not
presume
too
much
on
that
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
down
the
book
presently
and
got
up
,
standing
before
the
fire
*NL*
with
his
hands
behind
him
.
``
Well
,
I
hold
that
it
lies
in
your
hands
.
I
*NL*
shall
leave
it
there
.
With
a
little
good-will
you
may
manage
it
.
Think
*NL*
that
over
and
remember
how
much
I
count
on
you
.
''
He
waited
a
little
,
*NL*
to
give
her
time
to
answer
;
but
she
answered
nothing
,
and
he
presently
*NL*
strolled
out
of
the
room
.

CHAPTER
XLII
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
answered
nothing
because
his
words
had
put
the
situation
before
*NL*
her
and
she
was
absorbed
in
looking
at
it
.
There
was
something
in
them
*NL*
that
suddenly
made
vibrations
deep
,
so
that
she
had
been
afraid
to
trust
*NL*
herself
to
speak
.
After
he
had
gone
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
*NL*
closed
her
eyes
;
and
for
a
long
time
,
far
into
the
night
and
still
*NL*
further
,
she
sat
in
the
still
drawing-room
,
given
up
to
her
meditation
.
*NL*
A
servant
came
in
to
attend
to
the
fire
,
and
she
bade
him
bring
fresh
*NL*
candles
and
then
go
to
bed
.
Osmond
had
told
her
to
think
of
what
he
had
*NL*
said
;
and
she
did
so
indeed
,
and
of
many
other
things
.
The
suggestion
*NL*
from
another
that
she
had
a
definite
influence
on
Lord
Warburton
--
this
*NL*
had
given
her
the
start
that
accompanies
unexpected
recognition
.
Was
it
*NL*
true
that
there
was
something
still
between
them
that
might
be
a
handle
*NL*
to
make
him
declare
himself
to
Pansy
--
a
susceptibility
,
on
his
part
,
to
*NL*
approval
,
a
desire
to
do
what
would
please
her
?
Isabel
had
hitherto
not
*NL*
asked
herself
the
question
,
because
she
had
not
been
forced
;
but
now
*NL*
that
it
was
directly
presented
to
her
she
saw
the
answer
,
and
the
answer
*NL*
frightened
her
.
Yes
,
there
was
something
--
something
on
Lord
Warburton
's
*NL*
part
.
When
he
had
first
come
to
Rome
she
believed
the
link
that
united
*NL*
them
to
be
completely
snapped
;
but
little
by
little
she
had
been
*NL*
reminded
that
it
had
yet
a
palpable
existence
.
It
was
as
thin
as
a
hair
,
*NL*
but
there
were
moments
when
she
seemed
to
hear
it
vibrate
.
For
herself
*NL*
nothing
was
changed
;
what
she
once
thought
of
him
she
always
thought
;
*NL*
it
was
needless
this
feeling
should
change
;
it
seemed
to
her
in
fact
a
*NL*
better
feeling
than
ever
.
But
he
?
had
he
still
the
idea
that
she
might
*NL*
be
more
to
him
than
other
women
?
Had
he
the
wish
to
profit
by
the
memory
*NL*
of
the
few
moments
of
intimacy
through
which
they
had
once
passed
?
*NL*
Isabel
knew
she
had
read
some
of
the
signs
of
such
a
disposition
.
But
*NL*
what
were
his
hopes
,
his
pretensions
,
and
in
what
strange
way
were
they
*NL*
mingled
with
his
evidently
very
sincere
appreciation
of
poor
Pansy
?
Was
*NL*
he
in
love
with
Gilbert
Osmond
's
wife
,
and
if
so
what
comfort
did
he
*NL*
expect
to
derive
from
it
?
If
he
was
in
love
with
Pansy
he
was
not
in
*NL*
love
with
her
stepmother
,
and
if
he
was
in
love
with
her
stepmother
*NL*
he
was
not
in
love
with
Pansy
.
Was
she
to
cultivate
the
advantage
she
*NL*
possessed
in
order
to
make
him
commit
himself
to
Pansy
,
knowing
he
would
*NL*
do
so
for
her
sake
and
not
for
the
small
creature
's
own
--
was
this
the
*NL*
service
her
husband
had
asked
of
her
?
This
at
any
rate
was
the
duty
*NL*
with
which
she
found
herself
confronted
--
from
the
moment
she
admitted
to
*NL*
herself
that
her
old
friend
had
still
an
uneradicated
predilection
for
*NL*
her
society
.
It
was
not
an
agreeable
task
;
it
was
in
fact
a
repulsive
*NL*
one
.
She
asked
herself
with
dismay
whether
Lord
Warburton
were
*NL*
pretending
to
be
in
love
with
Pansy
in
order
to
cultivate
another
*NL*
satisfaction
and
what
might
be
called
other
chances
.
Of
this
refinement
*NL*
of
duplicity
she
presently
acquitted
him
;
she
preferred
to
believe
him
*NL*
in
perfect
good
faith
.
But
if
his
admiration
for
Pansy
were
a
delusion
*NL*
this
was
scarcely
better
than
its
being
an
affectation
.
Isabel
wandered
*NL*
among
these
ugly
possibilities
until
she
had
completely
lost
her
way
;
*NL*
some
of
them
,
as
she
suddenly
encountered
them
,
seemed
ugly
enough
.
Then
*NL*
she
broke
out
of
the
labyrinth
,
rubbing
her
eyes
,
and
declared
that
her
*NL*
imagination
surely
did
her
little
honour
and
that
her
husband
's
did
him
*NL*
even
less
.
Lord
Warburton
was
as
disinterested
as
he
need
be
,
and
she
*NL*
was
no
more
to
him
than
she
need
wish
.
She
would
rest
upon
this
till
*NL*
the
contrary
should
be
proved
;
proved
more
effectually
than
by
a
cynical
*NL*
intimation
of
Osmond
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
resolution
,
however
,
brought
her
this
evening
but
little
peace
,
*NL*
for
her
soul
was
haunted
with
terrors
which
crowded
to
the
foreground
of
*NL*
thought
as
quickly
as
a
place
was
made
for
them
.
What
had
suddenly
set
*NL*
them
into
livelier
motion
she
hardly
knew
,
unless
it
were
the
strange
*NL*
impression
she
had
received
in
the
afternoon
of
her
husband
's
being
in
*NL*
more
direct
communication
with
Madame
Merle
than
she
suspected
.
That
*NL*
impression
came
back
to
her
from
time
to
time
,
and
now
she
wondered
it
*NL*
had
never
come
before
.
Besides
this
,
her
short
interview
with
Osmond
*NL*
half
an
hour
ago
was
a
striking
example
of
his
faculty
for
making
*NL*
everything
wither
that
he
touched
,
spoiling
everything
for
her
that
he
*NL*
looked
at
.
It
was
very
well
to
undertake
to
give
him
a
proof
of
loyalty
;
*NL*
the
real
fact
was
that
the
knowledge
of
his
expecting
a
thing
raised
a
*NL*
presumption
against
it
.
It
was
as
if
he
had
had
the
evil
eye
;
as
if
his
*NL*
presence
were
a
blight
and
his
favour
a
misfortune
.
Was
the
fault
in
*NL*
himself
,
or
only
in
the
deep
mistrust
she
had
conceived
for
him
?
This
*NL*
mistrust
was
now
the
clearest
result
of
their
short
married
life
;
a
gulf
*NL*
had
opened
between
them
over
which
they
looked
at
each
other
with
eyes
*NL*
that
were
on
either
side
a
declaration
of
the
deception
suffered
.
It
*NL*
was
a
strange
opposition
,
of
the
like
of
which
she
had
never
dreamed
--
an
*NL*
opposition
in
which
the
vital
principle
of
the
one
was
a
thing
of
*NL*
contempt
to
the
other
.
It
was
not
her
fault
--
she
had
practised
no
*NL*
deception
;
she
had
only
admired
and
believed
.
She
had
taken
all
the
*NL*
first
steps
in
the
purest
confidence
,
and
then
she
had
suddenly
found
*NL*
the
infinite
vista
of
a
multiplied
life
to
be
a
dark
,
narrow
alley
*NL*
with
a
dead
wall
at
the
end
.
Instead
of
leading
to
the
high
places
of
*NL*
happiness
,
from
which
the
world
would
seem
to
lie
below
one
,
so
that
one
*NL*
could
look
down
with
a
sense
of
exaltation
and
advantage
,
and
judge
and
*NL*
choose
and
pity
,
it
led
rather
downward
and
earthward
,
into
realms
of
*NL*
restriction
and
depression
where
the
sound
of
other
lives
,
easier
*NL*
and
freer
,
was
heard
as
from
above
,
and
where
it
served
to
deepen
the
*NL*
feeling
of
failure
.
It
was
her
deep
distrust
of
her
husband
--
this
was
*NL*
what
darkened
the
world
.
That
is
a
sentiment
easily
indicated
,
but
not
*NL*
so
easily
explained
,
and
so
composite
in
its
character
that
much
time
*NL*
and
still
more
suffering
had
been
needed
to
bring
it
to
its
actual
*NL*
perfection
.
Suffering
,
with
Isabel
,
was
an
active
condition
;
it
was
*NL*
not
a
chill
,
a
stupor
,
a
despair
;
it
was
a
passion
of
thought
,
of
*NL*
speculation
,
of
response
to
every
pressure
.
She
flattered
herself
*NL*
that
she
had
kept
her
failing
faith
to
herself
,
however
,
--
that
no
one
*NL*
suspected
it
but
Osmond
.
Oh
,
he
knew
it
,
and
there
were
times
when
she
*NL*
thought
he
enjoyed
it
.
It
had
come
gradually
--
it
was
not
till
the
first
*NL*
year
of
their
life
together
,
so
admirably
intimate
at
first
,
had
closed
*NL*
that
she
had
taken
the
alarm
.
Then
the
shadows
had
begun
to
gather
;
it
*NL*
was
as
if
Osmond
deliberately
,
almost
malignantly
,
had
put
the
lights
*NL*
out
one
by
one
.
The
dusk
at
first
was
vague
and
thin
,
and
she
could
*NL*
still
see
her
way
in
it
.
But
it
steadily
deepened
,
and
if
now
and
again
*NL*
it
had
occasionally
lifted
there
were
certain
corners
of
her
prospect
*NL*
that
were
impenetrably
black
.
These
shadows
were
not
an
emanation
from
*NL*
her
own
mind
:
she
was
very
sure
of
that
;
she
had
done
her
best
to
be
*NL*
just
and
temperate
,
to
see
only
the
truth
.
They
were
a
part
,
they
were
*NL*
a
kind
of
creation
and
consequence
,
of
her
husband
's
very
presence
.
They
*NL*
were
not
his
misdeeds
,
his
turpitudes
;
she
accused
him
of
nothing
--
that
*NL*
is
but
of
one
thing
,
which
was
NOT
a
crime
.
She
knew
of
no
wrong
he
had
*NL*
done
;
he
was
not
violent
,
he
was
not
cruel
:
she
simply
believed
he
hated
*NL*
her
.
That
was
all
she
accused
him
of
,
and
the
miserable
part
of
it
was
*NL*
precisely
that
it
was
not
a
crime
,
for
against
a
crime
she
might
have
*NL*
found
redress
.
He
had
discovered
that
she
was
so
different
,
that
she
was
*NL*
not
what
he
had
believed
she
would
prove
to
be
.
He
had
thought
at
first
*NL*
he
could
change
her
,
and
she
had
done
her
best
to
be
what
he
would
like
.
*NL*
But
she
was
,
after
all
,
herself
--
she
could
n't
help
that
;
and
now
there
*NL*
was
no
use
pretending
,
wearing
a
mask
or
a
dress
,
for
he
knew
her
and
*NL*
had
made
up
his
mind
.
She
was
not
afraid
of
him
;
she
had
no
apprehension
*NL*
he
would
hurt
her
;
for
the
ill-will
he
bore
her
was
not
of
that
sort
.
*NL*
He
would
if
possible
never
give
her
a
pretext
,
never
put
himself
in
the
*NL*
wrong
.
Isabel
,
scanning
the
future
with
dry
,
fixed
eyes
,
saw
that
he
*NL*
would
have
the
better
of
her
there
.
She
would
give
him
many
pretexts
,
*NL*
she
would
often
put
herself
in
the
wrong
.
There
were
times
when
she
*NL*
almost
pitied
him
;
for
if
she
had
not
deceived
him
in
intention
she
*NL*
understood
how
completely
she
must
have
done
so
in
fact
.
She
had
effaced
*NL*
herself
when
he
first
knew
her
;
she
had
made
herself
small
,
pretending
*NL*
there
was
less
of
her
than
there
really
was
.
It
was
because
she
had
been
*NL*
under
the
extraordinary
charm
that
he
,
on
his
side
,
had
taken
pains
to
*NL*
put
forth
.
He
was
not
changed
;
he
had
not
disguised
himself
,
during
the
*NL*
year
of
his
courtship
,
any
more
than
she
.
But
she
had
seen
only
half
his
*NL*
nature
then
,
as
one
saw
the
disk
of
the
moon
when
it
was
partly
masked
*NL*
by
the
shadow
of
the
earth
.
She
saw
the
full
moon
now
--
she
saw
the
*NL*
whole
man
.
She
had
kept
still
,
as
it
were
,
so
that
he
should
have
a
free
*NL*
field
,
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
she
had
mistaken
a
part
for
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
she
had
been
immensely
under
the
charm
!
It
had
not
passed
away
;
it
*NL*
was
there
still
:
she
still
knew
perfectly
what
it
was
that
made
Osmond
*NL*
delightful
when
he
chose
to
be
.
He
had
wished
to
be
when
he
made
love
*NL*
to
her
,
and
as
she
had
wished
to
be
charmed
it
was
not
wonderful
he
*NL*
had
succeeded
.
He
had
succeeded
because
he
had
been
sincere
;
it
never
*NL*
occurred
to
her
now
to
deny
him
that
.
He
admired
her
--
he
had
told
her
*NL*
why
:
because
she
was
the
most
imaginative
woman
he
had
known
.
It
might
*NL*
very
well
have
been
true
;
for
during
those
months
she
had
imagined
*NL*
a
world
of
things
that
had
no
substance
.
She
had
had
a
more
wondrous
*NL*
vision
of
him
,
fed
through
charmed
senses
and
oh
such
a
stirred
*NL*
fancy
!
--
she
had
not
read
him
right
.
A
certain
combination
of
features
*NL*
had
touched
her
,
and
in
them
she
had
seen
the
most
striking
of
figures
.
*NL*
That
he
was
poor
and
lonely
and
yet
that
somehow
he
was
noble
--
that
was
*NL*
what
had
interested
her
and
seemed
to
give
her
her
opportunity
.
There
*NL*
had
been
an
indefinable
beauty
about
him
--
in
his
situation
,
in
his
mind
,
*NL*
in
his
face
.
She
had
felt
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
helpless
and
*NL*
ineffectual
,
but
the
feeling
had
taken
the
form
of
a
tenderness
*NL*
which
was
the
very
flower
of
respect
.
He
was
like
a
sceptical
voyager
*NL*
strolling
on
the
beach
while
he
waited
for
the
tide
,
looking
seaward
yet
*NL*
not
putting
to
sea
.
It
was
in
all
this
she
had
found
her
occasion
.
She
*NL*
would
launch
his
boat
for
him
;
she
would
be
his
providence
;
it
would
be
*NL*
a
good
thing
to
love
him
.
And
she
had
loved
him
,
she
had
so
anxiously
*NL*
and
yet
so
ardently
given
herself
--
a
good
deal
for
what
she
found
in
*NL*
him
,
but
a
good
deal
also
for
what
she
brought
him
and
what
might
enrich
*NL*
the
gift
.
As
she
looked
back
at
the
passion
of
those
full
weeks
she
*NL*
perceived
in
it
a
kind
of
maternal
strain
--
the
happiness
of
a
woman
who
*NL*
felt
that
she
was
a
contributor
,
that
she
came
with
charged
hands
.
But
*NL*
for
her
money
,
as
she
saw
to-day
,
she
would
never
have
done
it
.
And
then
*NL*
her
mind
wandered
off
to
poor
Mr.
Touchett
,
sleeping
under
English
turf
,
*NL*
the
beneficent
author
of
infinite
woe
!
For
this
was
the
fantastic
fact
.
*NL*
At
bottom
her
money
had
been
a
burden
,
had
been
on
her
mind
,
which
*NL*
was
filled
with
the
desire
to
transfer
the
weight
of
it
to
some
other
*NL*
conscience
,
to
some
more
prepared
receptacle
.
What
would
lighten
her
*NL*
own
conscience
more
effectually
than
to
make
it
over
to
the
man
with
the
*NL*
best
taste
in
the
world
?
Unless
she
should
have
given
it
to
a
hospital
*NL*
there
would
have
been
nothing
better
she
could
do
with
it
;
and
there
was
*NL*
no
charitable
institution
in
which
she
had
been
as
much
interested
as
*NL*
in
Gilbert
Osmond
.
He
would
use
her
fortune
in
a
way
that
would
make
her
*NL*
think
better
of
it
and
rub
off
a
certain
grossness
attaching
to
the
good
*NL*
luck
of
an
unexpected
inheritance
.
There
had
been
nothing
very
delicate
*NL*
in
inheriting
seventy
thousand
pounds
;
the
delicacy
had
been
all
in
Mr.
*NL*
Touchett
's
leaving
them
to
her
.
But
to
marry
Gilbert
Osmond
and
bring
*NL*
him
such
a
portion
--
in
that
there
would
be
delicacy
for
her
as
well
.
*NL*
There
would
be
less
for
him
--
that
was
true
;
but
that
was
his
affair
,
and
*NL*
if
he
loved
her
he
would
n't
object
to
her
being
rich
.
Had
he
not
had
the
*NL*
courage
to
say
he
was
glad
she
was
rich
?
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
's
cheek
burned
when
she
asked
herself
if
she
had
really
married
*NL*
on
a
factitious
theory
,
in
order
to
do
something
finely
appreciable
with
*NL*
her
money
.
But
she
was
able
to
answer
quickly
enough
that
this
was
*NL*
only
half
the
story
.
It
was
because
a
certain
ardour
took
possession
of
*NL*
her
--
a
sense
of
the
earnestness
of
his
affection
and
a
delight
in
*NL*
his
personal
qualities
.
He
was
better
than
any
one
else
.
This
supreme
*NL*
conviction
had
filled
her
life
for
months
,
and
enough
of
it
still
*NL*
remained
to
prove
to
her
that
she
could
not
have
done
otherwise
.
The
*NL*
finest
--
in
the
sense
of
being
the
subtlest
--
manly
organism
she
had
ever
*NL*
known
had
become
her
property
,
and
the
recognition
of
her
having
but
*NL*
to
put
out
her
hands
and
take
it
had
been
originally
a
sort
of
act
of
*NL*
devotion
.
She
had
not
been
mistaken
about
the
beauty
of
his
mind
;
she
*NL*
knew
that
organ
perfectly
now
.
She
had
lived
with
it
,
she
had
lived
IN
*NL*
it
almost
--
it
appeared
to
have
become
her
habitation
.
If
she
had
been
*NL*
captured
it
had
taken
a
firm
hand
to
seize
her
;
that
reflection
perhaps
*NL*
had
some
worth
.
A
mind
more
ingenious
,
more
pliant
,
more
cultivated
,
*NL*
more
trained
to
admirable
exercises
,
she
had
not
encountered
;
and
it
was
*NL*
this
exquisite
instrument
she
had
now
to
reckon
with
.
She
lost
herself
*NL*
in
infinite
dismay
when
she
thought
of
the
magnitude
of
HIS
deception
.
*NL*
It
was
a
wonder
,
perhaps
,
in
view
of
this
,
that
he
did
n't
hate
her
more
.
*NL*
She
remembered
perfectly
the
first
sign
he
had
given
of
it
--
it
had
been
*NL*
like
the
bell
that
was
to
ring
up
the
curtain
upon
the
real
drama
of
*NL*
their
life
.
He
said
to
her
one
day
that
she
had
too
many
ideas
and
that
*NL*
she
must
get
rid
of
them
.
He
had
told
her
that
already
,
before
their
*NL*
marriage
;
but
then
she
had
not
noticed
it
:
it
had
come
back
to
her
only
*NL*
afterwards
.
This
time
she
might
well
have
noticed
it
,
because
he
had
*NL*
really
meant
it
.
The
words
had
been
nothing
superficially
;
but
when
in
*NL*
the
light
of
deepening
experience
she
had
looked
into
them
they
had
then
*NL*
appeared
portentous
.
He
had
really
meant
it
--
he
would
have
liked
her
to
*NL*
have
nothing
of
her
own
but
her
pretty
appearance
.
She
had
known
she
had
*NL*
too
many
ideas
;
she
had
more
even
than
he
had
supposed
,
many
more
than
*NL*
she
had
expressed
to
him
when
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
.
Yes
,
she
*NL*
HAD
been
hypocritical
;
she
had
liked
him
so
much
.
She
had
too
many
ideas
*NL*
for
herself
;
but
that
was
just
what
one
married
for
,
to
share
them
with
*NL*
some
one
else
.
One
could
n't
pluck
them
up
by
the
roots
,
though
of
course
*NL*
one
might
suppress
them
,
be
careful
not
to
utter
them
.
It
had
not
been
*NL*
this
,
however
,
his
objecting
to
her
opinions
;
this
had
been
nothing
.
She
*NL*
had
no
opinions
--
none
that
she
would
not
have
been
eager
to
sacrifice
in
*NL*
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
herself
loved
for
it
.
What
he
had
meant
*NL*
had
been
the
whole
thing
--
her
character
,
the
way
she
felt
,
the
way
she
*NL*
judged
.
This
was
what
she
had
kept
in
reserve
;
this
was
what
he
had
not
*NL*
known
until
he
had
found
himself
--
with
the
door
closed
behind
,
as
it
*NL*
were
--
set
down
face
to
face
with
it
.
She
had
a
certain
way
of
looking
at
*NL*
life
which
he
took
as
a
personal
offence
.
Heaven
knew
that
now
at
least
*NL*
it
was
a
very
humble
,
accommodating
way
!
The
strange
thing
was
that
*NL*
she
should
not
have
suspected
from
the
first
that
his
own
had
been
so
*NL*
different
.
She
had
thought
it
so
large
,
so
enlightened
,
so
perfectly
*NL*
that
of
an
honest
man
and
a
gentleman
.
Had
n't
he
assured
her
that
he
had
*NL*
no
superstitions
,
no
dull
limitations
,
no
prejudices
that
had
lost
their
*NL*
freshness
?
Had
n't
he
all
the
appearance
of
a
man
living
in
the
open
air
*NL*
of
the
world
,
indifferent
to
small
considerations
,
caring
only
for
truth
*NL*
and
knowledge
and
believing
that
two
intelligent
people
ought
to
look
*NL*
for
them
together
and
,
whether
they
found
them
or
not
,
find
at
least
*NL*
some
happiness
in
the
search
?
He
had
told
her
he
loved
the
conventional
;
*NL*
but
there
was
a
sense
in
which
this
seemed
a
noble
declaration
.
In
that
*NL*
sense
,
that
of
the
love
of
harmony
and
order
and
decency
and
of
all
the
*NL*
stately
offices
of
life
,
she
went
with
him
freely
,
and
his
warning
had
*NL*
contained
nothing
ominous
.
But
when
,
as
the
months
had
elapsed
,
she
*NL*
had
followed
him
further
and
he
had
led
her
into
the
mansion
of
his
own
*NL*
habitation
,
then
,
THEN
she
had
seen
where
she
really
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
live
it
over
again
,
the
incredulous
terror
with
which
she
*NL*
had
taken
the
measure
of
her
dwelling
.
Between
those
four
walls
she
had
*NL*
lived
ever
since
;
they
were
to
surround
her
for
the
rest
of
her
life
.
*NL*
It
was
the
house
of
darkness
,
the
house
of
dumbness
,
the
house
of
*NL*
suffocation
.
Osmond
's
beautiful
mind
gave
it
neither
light
nor
air
;
*NL*
Osmond
's
beautiful
mind
indeed
seemed
to
peep
down
from
a
small
high
*NL*
window
and
mock
at
her
.
Of
course
it
had
not
been
physical
suffering
;
*NL*
for
physical
suffering
there
might
have
been
a
remedy
.
She
could
come
*NL*
and
go
;
she
had
her
liberty
;
her
husband
was
perfectly
polite
.
He
took
*NL*
himself
so
seriously
;
it
was
something
appalling
.
Under
all
his
culture
,
*NL*
his
cleverness
,
his
amenity
,
under
his
good-nature
,
his
facility
,
his
*NL*
knowledge
of
life
,
his
egotism
lay
hidden
like
a
serpent
in
a
bank
*NL*
of
flowers
.
She
had
taken
him
seriously
,
but
she
had
not
taken
him
so
*NL*
seriously
as
that
.
How
could
she
--
especially
when
she
had
known
him
*NL*
better
?
She
was
to
think
of
him
as
he
thought
of
himself
--
as
the
first
*NL*
gentleman
in
Europe
.
So
it
was
that
she
had
thought
of
him
at
first
,
and
*NL*
that
indeed
was
the
reason
she
had
married
him
.
But
when
she
began
to
*NL*
see
what
it
implied
she
drew
back
;
there
was
more
in
the
bond
than
she
*NL*
had
meant
to
put
her
name
to
.
It
implied
a
sovereign
contempt
for
every
*NL*
one
but
some
three
or
four
very
exalted
people
whom
he
envied
,
and
for
*NL*
everything
in
the
world
but
half
a
dozen
ideas
of
his
own
.
That
was
very
*NL*
well
;
she
would
have
gone
with
him
even
there
a
long
distance
;
for
*NL*
he
pointed
out
to
her
so
much
of
the
baseness
and
shabbiness
of
life
,
*NL*
opened
her
eyes
so
wide
to
the
stupidity
,
the
depravity
,
the
ignorance
*NL*
of
mankind
,
that
she
had
been
properly
impressed
with
the
infinite
*NL*
vulgarity
of
things
and
of
the
virtue
of
keeping
one
's
self
unspotted
by
*NL*
it
.
But
this
base
,
if
noble
world
,
it
appeared
,
was
after
all
what
one
*NL*
was
to
live
for
;
one
was
to
keep
it
forever
in
one
's
eye
,
in
order
*NL*
not
to
enlighten
or
convert
or
redeem
it
,
but
to
extract
from
it
some
*NL*
recognition
of
one
's
own
superiority
.
On
the
one
hand
it
was
despicable
,
*NL*
but
on
the
other
it
afforded
a
standard
.
Osmond
had
talked
to
Isabel
*NL*
about
his
renunciation
,
his
indifference
,
the
ease
with
which
he
*NL*
dispensed
with
the
usual
aids
to
success
;
and
all
this
had
seemed
to
*NL*
her
admirable
.
She
had
thought
it
a
grand
indifference
,
an
exquisite
*NL*
independence
.
But
indifference
was
really
the
last
of
his
qualities
;
*NL*
she
had
never
seen
any
one
who
thought
so
much
of
others
.
For
herself
,
*NL*
avowedly
,
the
world
had
always
interested
her
and
the
study
of
her
*NL*
fellow
creatures
been
her
constant
passion
.
She
would
have
been
willing
,
*NL*
however
,
to
renounce
all
her
curiosities
and
sympathies
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
a
personal
life
,
if
the
person
concerned
had
only
been
able
to
make
her
*NL*
believe
it
was
a
gain
!
This
at
least
was
her
present
conviction
;
and
*NL*
the
thing
certainly
would
have
been
easier
than
to
care
for
society
as
*NL*
Osmond
cared
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
unable
to
live
without
it
,
and
she
saw
that
he
had
never
really
*NL*
done
so
;
he
had
looked
at
it
out
of
his
window
even
when
he
appeared
*NL*
to
be
most
detached
from
it
.
He
had
his
ideal
,
just
as
she
had
tried
to
*NL*
have
hers
;
only
it
was
strange
that
people
should
seek
for
justice
in
*NL*
such
different
quarters
.
His
ideal
was
a
conception
of
high
prosperity
*NL*
and
propriety
,
of
the
aristocratic
life
,
which
she
now
saw
that
he
*NL*
deemed
himself
always
,
in
essence
at
least
,
to
have
led
.
He
had
never
*NL*
lapsed
from
it
for
an
hour
;
he
would
never
have
recovered
from
the
shame
*NL*
of
doing
so
.
That
again
was
very
well
;
here
too
she
would
have
agreed
;
*NL*
but
they
attached
such
different
ideas
,
such
different
associations
and
*NL*
desires
,
to
the
same
formulas
.
Her
notion
of
the
aristocratic
life
was
*NL*
simply
the
union
of
great
knowledge
with
great
liberty
;
the
knowledge
*NL*
would
give
one
a
sense
of
duty
and
the
liberty
a
sense
of
enjoyment
.
But
*NL*
for
Osmond
it
was
altogether
a
thing
of
forms
,
a
conscious
,
calculated
*NL*
attitude
.
He
was
fond
of
the
old
,
the
consecrated
,
the
transmitted
;
*NL*
so
was
she
,
but
she
pretended
to
do
what
she
chose
with
it
.
He
had
an
*NL*
immense
esteem
for
tradition
;
he
had
told
her
once
that
the
best
thing
*NL*
in
the
world
was
to
have
it
,
but
that
if
one
was
so
unfortunate
as
not
*NL*
to
have
it
one
must
immediately
proceed
to
make
it
.
She
knew
that
he
*NL*
meant
by
this
that
she
had
n't
it
,
but
that
he
was
better
off
;
though
*NL*
from
what
source
he
had
derived
his
traditions
she
never
learned
.
He
*NL*
had
a
very
large
collection
of
them
,
however
;
that
was
very
certain
,
*NL*
and
after
a
little
she
began
to
see
.
The
great
thing
was
to
act
in
*NL*
accordance
with
them
;
the
great
thing
not
only
for
him
but
for
her
.
*NL*
Isabel
had
an
undefined
conviction
that
to
serve
for
another
person
than
*NL*
their
proprietor
traditions
must
be
of
a
thoroughly
superior
kind
;
but
*NL*
she
nevertheless
assented
to
this
intimation
that
she
too
must
march
*NL*
to
the
stately
music
that
floated
down
from
unknown
periods
in
her
*NL*
husband
's
past
;
she
who
of
old
had
been
so
free
of
step
,
so
desultory
,
*NL*
so
devious
,
so
much
the
reverse
of
processional
.
There
were
certain
*NL*
things
they
must
do
,
a
certain
posture
they
must
take
,
certain
people
*NL*
they
must
know
and
not
know
.
When
she
saw
this
rigid
system
close
about
*NL*
her
,
draped
though
it
was
in
pictured
tapestries
,
that
sense
of
darkness
*NL*
and
suffocation
of
which
I
have
spoken
took
possession
of
her
;
she
*NL*
seemed
shut
up
with
an
odour
of
mould
and
decay
.
She
had
resisted
of
*NL*
course
;
at
first
very
humorously
,
ironically
,
tenderly
;
then
,
as
the
*NL*
situation
grew
more
serious
,
eagerly
,
passionately
,
pleadingly
.
She
had
*NL*
pleaded
the
cause
of
freedom
,
of
doing
as
they
chose
,
of
not
caring
for
*NL*
the
aspect
and
denomination
of
their
life
--
the
cause
of
other
instincts
*NL*
and
longings
,
of
quite
another
ideal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
was
that
her
husband
's
personality
,
touched
as
it
never
had
*NL*
been
,
stepped
forth
and
stood
erect
.
The
things
she
had
said
were
*NL*
answered
only
by
his
scorn
,
and
she
could
see
he
was
ineffably
ashamed
*NL*
of
her
.
What
did
he
think
of
her
--
that
she
was
base
,
vulgar
,
ignoble
?
*NL*
He
at
least
knew
now
that
she
had
no
traditions
!
It
had
not
been
in
his
*NL*
prevision
of
things
that
she
should
reveal
such
flatness
;
her
sentiments
*NL*
were
worthy
of
a
radical
newspaper
or
a
Unitarian
preacher
.
The
real
*NL*
offence
,
as
she
ultimately
perceived
,
was
her
having
a
mind
of
her
*NL*
own
at
all
.
Her
mind
was
to
be
his
--
attached
to
his
own
like
a
small
*NL*
garden-plot
to
a
deer-park
.
He
would
rake
the
soil
gently
and
water
the
*NL*
flowers
;
he
would
weed
the
beds
and
gather
an
occasional
nosegay
.
*NL*
It
would
be
a
pretty
piece
of
property
for
a
proprietor
already
*NL*
far-reaching
.
He
did
n't
wish
her
to
be
stupid
.
On
the
contrary
,
it
was
*NL*
because
she
was
clever
that
she
had
pleased
him
.
But
he
expected
her
*NL*
intelligence
to
operate
altogether
in
his
favour
,
and
so
far
from
*NL*
desiring
her
mind
to
be
a
blank
he
had
flattered
himself
that
it
would
*NL*
be
richly
receptive
.
He
had
expected
his
wife
to
feel
with
him
and
for
*NL*
him
,
to
enter
into
his
opinions
,
his
ambitions
,
his
preferences
;
and
*NL*
Isabel
was
obliged
to
confess
that
this
was
no
great
insolence
on
the
*NL*
part
of
a
man
so
accomplished
and
a
husband
originally
at
least
so
*NL*
tender
.
But
there
were
certain
things
she
could
never
take
in
.
To
*NL*
begin
with
,
they
were
hideously
unclean
.
She
was
not
a
daughter
of
the
*NL*
Puritans
,
but
for
all
that
she
believed
in
such
a
thing
as
chastity
and
*NL*
even
as
decency
.
It
would
appear
that
Osmond
was
far
from
doing
anything
*NL*
of
the
sort
;
some
of
his
traditions
made
her
push
back
her
skirts
.
Did
*NL*
all
women
have
lovers
?
Did
they
all
lie
and
even
the
best
have
their
*NL*
price
?
Were
there
only
three
or
four
that
did
n't
deceive
their
husbands
?
*NL*
When
Isabel
heard
such
things
she
felt
a
greater
scorn
for
them
than
for
*NL*
the
gossip
of
a
village
parlour
--
a
scorn
that
kept
its
freshness
in
*NL*
a
very
tainted
air
.
There
was
the
taint
of
her
sister-in-law
:
did
her
*NL*
husband
judge
only
by
the
Countess
Gemini
?
This
lady
very
often
lied
,
*NL*
and
she
had
practised
deceptions
that
were
not
simply
verbal
.
It
was
*NL*
enough
to
find
these
facts
assumed
among
Osmond
's
traditions
--
it
was
*NL*
enough
without
giving
them
such
a
general
extension
.
It
was
her
scorn
*NL*
of
his
assumptions
,
it
was
this
that
made
him
draw
himself
up
.
He
*NL*
had
plenty
of
contempt
,
and
it
was
proper
his
wife
should
be
as
well
*NL*
furnished
;
but
that
she
should
turn
the
hot
light
of
her
disdain
upon
*NL*
his
own
conception
of
things
--
this
was
a
danger
he
had
not
allowed
for
.
*NL*
He
believed
he
should
have
regulated
her
emotions
before
she
came
to
*NL*
it
;
and
Isabel
could
easily
imagine
how
his
ears
had
scorched
on
his
*NL*
discovering
he
had
been
too
confident
.
When
one
had
a
wife
who
gave
one
*NL*
that
sensation
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
hate
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
morally
certain
now
that
this
feeling
of
hatred
,
which
at
first
*NL*
had
been
a
refuge
and
a
refreshment
,
had
become
the
occupation
and
*NL*
comfort
of
his
life
.
The
feeling
was
deep
,
because
it
was
sincere
;
he
*NL*
had
had
the
revelation
that
she
could
after
all
dispense
with
him
.
If
*NL*
to
herself
the
idea
was
startling
,
if
it
presented
itself
at
first
as
a
*NL*
kind
of
infidelity
,
a
capacity
for
pollution
,
what
infinite
effect
might
*NL*
it
not
be
expected
to
have
had
upon
HIM
?
It
was
very
simple
;
he
*NL*
despised
her
;
she
had
no
traditions
and
the
moral
horizon
of
a
*NL*
Unitarian
minister
.
Poor
Isabel
,
who
had
never
been
able
to
understand
*NL*
Unitarianism
!
This
was
the
certitude
she
had
been
living
with
now
for
*NL*
a
time
that
she
had
ceased
to
measure
.
What
was
coming
--
what
was
before
*NL*
them
?
That
was
her
constant
question
.
What
would
he
do
--
what
ought
SHE
*NL*
to
do
?
When
a
man
hated
his
wife
what
did
it
lead
to
?
She
did
n't
hate
*NL*
him
,
that
she
was
sure
of
,
for
every
little
while
she
felt
a
passionate
*NL*
wish
to
give
him
a
pleasant
surprise
.
Very
often
,
however
,
she
felt
*NL*
afraid
,
and
it
used
to
come
over
her
,
as
I
have
intimated
,
that
she
*NL*
had
deceived
him
at
the
very
first
.
They
were
strangely
married
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
and
it
was
a
horrible
life
.
Until
that
morning
he
had
scarcely
*NL*
spoken
to
her
for
a
week
;
his
manner
was
as
dry
as
a
burned-out
*NL*
fire
.
She
knew
there
was
a
special
reason
;
he
was
displeased
at
Ralph
*NL*
Touchett
's
staying
on
in
Rome
.
He
thought
she
saw
too
much
of
her
*NL*
cousin
--
he
had
told
her
a
week
before
it
was
indecent
she
should
go
to
*NL*
him
at
his
hotel
.
He
would
have
said
more
than
this
if
Ralph
's
invalid
*NL*
state
had
not
appeared
to
make
it
brutal
to
denounce
him
;
but
having
had
*NL*
to
contain
himself
had
only
deepened
his
disgust
.
Isabel
read
all
this
*NL*
as
she
would
have
read
the
hour
on
the
clock-face
;
she
was
as
perfectly
*NL*
aware
that
the
sight
of
her
interest
in
her
cousin
stirred
her
husband
's
*NL*
rage
as
if
Osmond
had
locked
her
into
her
room
--
which
she
was
sure
was
*NL*
what
he
wanted
to
do
.
It
was
her
honest
belief
that
on
the
whole
she
*NL*
was
not
defiant
,
but
she
certainly
could
n't
pretend
to
be
indifferent
to
*NL*
Ralph
.
She
believed
he
was
dying
at
last
and
that
she
should
never
see
*NL*
him
again
,
and
this
gave
her
a
tenderness
for
him
that
she
had
never
*NL*
known
before
.
Nothing
was
a
pleasure
to
her
now
;
how
could
anything
be
*NL*
a
pleasure
to
a
woman
who
knew
that
she
had
thrown
away
her
life
?
There
*NL*
was
an
everlasting
weight
on
her
heart
--
there
was
a
livid
light
on
*NL*
everything
.
But
Ralph
's
little
visit
was
a
lamp
in
the
darkness
;
for
the
*NL*
hour
that
she
sat
with
him
her
ache
for
herself
became
somehow
her
ache
*NL*
for
HIM
.
She
felt
to-day
as
if
he
had
been
her
brother
.
She
had
never
*NL*
had
a
brother
,
but
if
she
had
and
she
were
in
trouble
and
he
were
dying
,
*NL*
he
would
be
dear
to
her
as
Ralph
was
.
Ah
yes
,
if
Gilbert
was
jealous
of
*NL*
her
there
was
perhaps
some
reason
;
it
did
n't
make
Gilbert
look
better
to
*NL*
sit
for
half
an
hour
with
Ralph
.
It
was
not
that
they
talked
of
him
--
it
*NL*
was
not
that
she
complained
.
His
name
was
never
uttered
between
them
.
It
*NL*
was
simply
that
Ralph
was
generous
and
that
her
husband
was
not
.
There
*NL*
was
something
in
Ralph
's
talk
,
in
his
smile
,
in
the
mere
fact
of
his
*NL*
being
in
Rome
,
that
made
the
blasted
circle
round
which
she
walked
more
*NL*
spacious
.
He
made
her
feel
the
good
of
the
world
;
he
made
her
feel
what
*NL*
might
have
been
.
He
was
after
all
as
intelligent
as
Osmond
--
quite
apart
*NL*
from
his
being
better
.
And
thus
it
seemed
to
her
an
act
of
devotion
*NL*
to
conceal
her
misery
from
him
.
She
concealed
it
elaborately
;
she
*NL*
was
perpetually
,
in
their
talk
,
hanging
out
curtains
and
before
her
*NL*
again
--
it
lived
before
her
again
,
--
it
had
never
had
time
to
die
--
that
*NL*
morning
in
the
garden
at
Florence
when
he
had
warned
her
against
Osmond
.
*NL*
She
had
only
to
close
her
eyes
to
see
the
place
,
to
hear
his
voice
,
to
*NL*
feel
the
warm
,
sweet
air
.
How
could
he
have
known
?
What
a
mystery
,
*NL*
what
a
wonder
of
wisdom
!
As
intelligent
as
Gilbert
?
He
was
much
more
*NL*
intelligent
--
to
arrive
at
such
a
judgement
as
that
.
Gilbert
had
never
*NL*
been
so
deep
,
so
just
.
She
had
told
him
then
that
from
her
at
least
he
*NL*
should
never
know
if
he
was
right
;
and
this
was
what
she
was
taking
*NL*
care
of
now
.
It
gave
her
plenty
to
do
;
there
was
passion
,
exaltation
,
*NL*
religion
in
it
.
Women
find
their
religion
sometimes
in
strange
*NL*
exercises
,
and
Isabel
at
present
,
in
playing
a
part
before
her
cousin
,
*NL*
had
an
idea
that
she
was
doing
him
a
kindness
.
It
would
have
been
a
*NL*
kindness
perhaps
if
he
had
been
for
a
single
instant
a
dupe
.
As
it
was
,
*NL*
the
kindness
consisted
mainly
in
trying
to
make
him
believe
that
he
had
*NL*
once
wounded
her
greatly
and
that
the
event
had
put
him
to
shame
,
but
*NL*
that
,
as
she
was
very
generous
and
he
was
so
ill
,
she
bore
him
no
grudge
*NL*
and
even
considerately
forbore
to
flaunt
her
happiness
in
his
face
.
*NL*
Ralph
smiled
to
himself
,
as
he
lay
on
his
sofa
,
at
this
extraordinary
*NL*
form
of
consideration
;
but
he
forgave
her
for
having
forgiven
him
.
She
*NL*
did
n't
wish
him
to
have
the
pain
of
knowing
she
was
unhappy
:
that
was
*NL*
the
great
thing
,
and
it
did
n't
matter
that
such
knowledge
would
rather
*NL*
have
righted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
herself
,
she
lingered
in
the
soundless
saloon
long
after
the
fire
*NL*
had
gone
out
.
There
was
no
danger
of
her
feeling
the
cold
;
she
was
in
*NL*
a
fever
.
She
heard
the
small
hours
strike
,
and
then
the
great
ones
,
but
*NL*
her
vigil
took
no
heed
of
time
.
Her
mind
,
assailed
by
visions
,
was
in
a
*NL*
state
of
extraordinary
activity
,
and
her
visions
might
as
well
come
to
*NL*
her
there
,
where
she
sat
up
to
meet
them
,
as
on
her
pillow
,
to
make
a
*NL*
mockery
of
rest
.
As
I
have
said
,
she
believed
she
was
not
defiant
,
and
*NL*
what
could
be
a
better
proof
of
it
than
that
she
should
linger
there
*NL*
half
the
night
,
trying
to
persuade
herself
that
there
was
no
reason
why
*NL*
Pansy
should
n't
be
married
as
you
would
put
a
letter
in
the
post-office
?
*NL*
When
the
clock
struck
four
she
got
up
;
she
was
going
to
bed
at
last
,
for
*NL*
the
lamp
had
long
since
gone
out
and
the
candles
burned
down
to
their
*NL*
sockets
.
But
even
then
she
stopped
again
in
the
middle
of
the
room
*NL*
and
stood
there
gazing
at
a
remembered
vision
--
that
of
her
husband
and
*NL*
Madame
Merle
unconsciously
and
familiarly
associated
.

CHAPTER
XLIII
*NL*
*NL*
Three
nights
after
this
she
took
Pansy
to
a
great
party
,
to
which
*NL*
Osmond
,
who
never
went
to
dances
,
did
not
accompany
them
.
Pansy
was
as
*NL*
ready
for
a
dance
as
ever
;
she
was
not
of
a
generalising
turn
and
had
*NL*
not
extended
to
other
pleasures
the
interdict
she
had
seen
placed
on
*NL*
those
of
love
.
If
she
was
biding
her
time
or
hoping
to
circumvent
her
*NL*
father
she
must
have
had
a
prevision
of
success
.
Isabel
thought
this
*NL*
unlikely
;
it
was
much
more
likely
that
Pansy
had
simply
determined
to
*NL*
be
a
good
girl
.
She
had
never
had
such
a
chance
,
and
she
had
a
proper
*NL*
esteem
for
chances
.
She
carried
herself
no
less
attentively
than
usual
*NL*
and
kept
no
less
anxious
an
eye
upon
her
vaporous
skirts
;
she
held
her
*NL*
bouquet
very
tight
and
counted
over
the
flowers
for
the
twentieth
time
.
*NL*
She
made
Isabel
feel
old
;
it
seemed
so
long
since
she
had
been
in
a
*NL*
flutter
about
a
ball
.
Pansy
,
who
was
greatly
admired
,
was
never
in
want
*NL*
of
partners
,
and
very
soon
after
their
arrival
she
gave
Isabel
,
who
was
*NL*
not
dancing
,
her
bouquet
to
hold
.
Isabel
had
rendered
her
this
service
*NL*
for
some
minutes
when
she
became
aware
of
the
near
presence
of
Edward
*NL*
Rosier
.
He
stood
before
her
;
he
had
lost
his
affable
smile
and
wore
a
*NL*
look
of
almost
military
resolution
.
The
change
in
his
appearance
would
*NL*
have
made
Isabel
smile
if
she
had
not
felt
his
case
to
be
at
bottom
*NL*
a
hard
one
:
he
had
always
smelt
so
much
more
of
heliotrope
than
of
*NL*
gunpowder
.
He
looked
at
her
a
moment
somewhat
fiercely
,
as
if
to
notify
*NL*
her
he
was
dangerous
,
and
then
dropped
his
eyes
on
her
bouquet
.
After
*NL*
he
had
inspected
it
his
glance
softened
and
he
said
quickly
:
``
It
's
all
*NL*
pansies
;
it
must
be
hers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
smiled
kindly
.
``
Yes
,
it
's
hers
;
she
gave
it
to
me
to
hold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
hold
it
a
little
,
Mrs.
Osmond
?
''
the
poor
young
man
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
trust
you
;
I
'm
afraid
you
would
n't
give
it
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
that
I
should
;
I
should
leave
the
house
with
it
instantly
.
*NL*
But
may
I
not
at
least
have
a
single
flower
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
,
smiling
still
,
held
out
the
*NL*
bouquet
.
``
Choose
one
yourself
.
It
's
frightful
what
I
'm
doing
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
if
you
do
no
more
than
this
,
Mrs.
Osmond
!
''
Rosier
exclaimed
with
*NL*
his
glass
in
one
eye
,
carefully
choosing
his
flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
put
it
into
your
button-hole
,
''
she
said
.
``
Do
n't
for
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
her
to
see
it
.
She
has
refused
to
dance
with
me
,
but
I
*NL*
wish
to
show
her
that
I
believe
in
her
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
well
to
show
it
to
her
,
but
it
's
out
of
place
to
show
it
to
*NL*
others
.
Her
father
has
told
her
not
to
dance
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
that
all
YOU
can
do
for
me
?
I
expected
more
from
you
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Osmond
,
''
said
the
young
man
in
a
tone
of
fine
general
reference
.
``
You
*NL*
know
our
acquaintance
goes
back
very
far
--
quite
into
the
days
of
our
*NL*
innocent
childhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
make
me
out
too
old
,
''
Isabel
patiently
answered
.
``
You
come
back
*NL*
to
that
very
often
,
and
I
've
never
denied
it
.
But
I
must
tell
you
that
,
*NL*
old
friends
as
we
are
,
if
you
had
done
me
the
honour
to
ask
me
to
marry
*NL*
you
I
should
have
refused
you
on
the
spot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
do
n't
esteem
me
then
.
Say
at
once
that
you
think
me
a
mere
*NL*
Parisian
trifler
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
esteem
you
very
much
,
but
I
'm
not
in
love
with
you
.
What
I
mean
by
*NL*
that
,
of
course
,
is
that
I
'm
not
in
love
with
you
for
Pansy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
;
I
see
.
You
pity
me
--
that
's
all
.
''
And
Edward
Rosier
looked
*NL*
all
round
,
inconsequently
,
with
his
single
glass
.
It
was
a
revelation
to
*NL*
him
that
people
should
n't
be
more
pleased
;
but
he
was
at
least
too
proud
*NL*
to
show
that
the
deficiency
struck
him
as
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
for
a
moment
said
nothing
.
His
manner
and
appearance
had
not
the
*NL*
dignity
of
the
deepest
tragedy
;
his
little
glass
,
among
other
things
,
*NL*
was
against
that
.
But
she
suddenly
felt
touched
;
her
own
unhappiness
,
*NL*
after
all
,
had
something
in
common
with
his
,
and
it
came
over
her
,
more
*NL*
than
before
,
that
here
,
in
recognisable
,
if
not
in
romantic
form
,
*NL*
was
the
most
affecting
thing
in
the
world
--
young
love
struggling
with
*NL*
adversity
.
``
Would
you
really
be
very
kind
to
her
?
''
she
finally
asked
in
*NL*
a
low
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
his
eyes
devoutly
and
raised
the
little
flower
that
he
held
*NL*
in
his
fingers
to
his
lips
.
Then
he
looked
at
her
.
``
You
pity
me
;
but
*NL*
do
n't
you
pity
HER
a
little
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
;
I
'm
not
sure
.
She
'll
always
enjoy
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
depend
on
what
you
call
life
!
''
Mr.
Rosier
effectively
said
.
*NL*
``
She
wo
n't
enjoy
being
tortured
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
'll
be
nothing
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
.
She
knows
what
she
's
about
.
You
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
does
,
and
she
'll
never
disobey
her
father
.
But
she
's
coming
*NL*
back
to
me
,
''
Isabel
added
,
``
and
I
must
beg
you
to
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosier
lingered
a
moment
till
Pansy
came
in
sight
on
the
arm
of
her
*NL*
cavalier
;
he
stood
just
long
enough
to
look
her
in
the
face
.
Then
he
*NL*
walked
away
,
holding
up
his
head
;
and
the
manner
in
which
he
achieved
*NL*
this
sacrifice
to
expediency
convinced
Isabel
he
was
very
much
in
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
,
who
seldom
got
disarranged
in
dancing
,
looking
perfectly
fresh
*NL*
and
cool
after
this
exercise
,
waited
a
moment
and
then
took
back
her
*NL*
bouquet
.
Isabel
watched
her
and
saw
she
was
counting
the
flowers
;
*NL*
whereupon
she
said
to
herself
that
decidedly
there
were
deeper
forces
at
*NL*
play
than
she
had
recognised
.
Pansy
had
seen
Rosier
turn
away
,
but
she
*NL*
said
nothing
to
Isabel
about
him
;
she
talked
only
of
her
partner
,
after
*NL*
he
had
made
his
bow
and
retired
;
of
the
music
,
the
floor
,
the
rare
*NL*
misfortune
of
having
already
torn
her
dress
.
Isabel
was
sure
,
however
,
*NL*
she
had
discovered
her
lover
to
have
abstracted
a
flower
;
though
this
*NL*
knowledge
was
not
needed
to
account
for
the
dutiful
grace
with
which
she
*NL*
responded
to
the
appeal
of
her
next
partner
.
That
perfect
amenity
under
*NL*
acute
constraint
was
part
of
a
larger
system
.
She
was
again
led
forth
*NL*
by
a
flushed
young
man
,
this
time
carrying
her
bouquet
;
and
she
had
*NL*
not
been
absent
many
minutes
when
Isabel
saw
Lord
Warburton
advancing
*NL*
through
the
crowd
.
He
presently
drew
near
and
bade
her
good-evening
;
*NL*
she
had
not
seen
him
since
the
day
before
.
He
looked
about
him
,
and
then
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
little
maid
?
''
he
asked
.
It
was
in
this
manner
that
he
had
*NL*
formed
the
harmless
habit
of
alluding
to
Miss
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
dancing
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
You
'll
see
her
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
among
the
dancers
and
at
last
caught
Pansy
's
eye
.
``
She
sees
*NL*
me
,
but
she
wo
n't
notice
me
,
''
he
then
remarked
.
``
Are
you
not
dancing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
see
,
I
'm
a
wall-flower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
dance
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
I
'd
rather
you
should
dance
with
the
little
maid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
need
n't
prevent
the
other
--
especially
as
she
's
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
engaged
for
everything
,
and
you
can
reserve
yourself
.
She
*NL*
dances
very
hard
,
and
you
'll
be
the
fresher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
dances
beautifully
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
,
following
her
with
his
*NL*
eyes
.
``
Ah
,
at
last
,
''
he
added
,
``
she
has
given
me
a
smile
.
''
He
stood
*NL*
there
with
his
handsome
,
easy
,
important
physiognomy
;
and
as
Isabel
*NL*
observed
him
it
came
over
her
,
as
it
had
done
before
,
that
it
was
*NL*
strange
a
man
of
his
mettle
should
take
an
interest
in
a
little
maid
.
It
*NL*
struck
her
as
a
great
incongruity
;
neither
Pansy
's
small
fascinations
,
*NL*
nor
his
own
kindness
,
his
good-nature
,
not
even
his
need
for
amusement
,
*NL*
which
was
extreme
and
constant
,
were
sufficient
to
account
for
it
.
``
I
*NL*
should
like
to
dance
with
you
,
''
he
went
on
in
a
moment
,
turning
back
to
*NL*
Isabel
;
``
but
I
think
I
like
even
better
to
talk
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
better
,
and
it
's
more
worthy
of
your
dignity
.
Great
statesmen
*NL*
ought
n't
to
waltz
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
cruel
.
Why
did
you
recommend
me
then
to
dance
with
Miss
*NL*
Osmond
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
different
.
If
you
danced
with
her
it
would
look
simply
like
*NL*
a
piece
of
kindness
--
as
if
you
were
doing
it
for
her
amusement
.
If
you
*NL*
dance
with
me
you
'll
look
as
if
you
were
doing
it
for
your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
have
n't
I
a
right
to
amuse
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
with
the
affairs
of
the
British
Empire
on
your
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
British
Empire
be
hanged
!
You
're
always
laughing
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amuse
yourself
with
talking
to
me
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
it
's
really
a
recreation
.
You
're
too
pointed
;
I
've
always
*NL*
to
be
defending
myself
.
And
you
strike
me
as
more
than
usually
dangerous
*NL*
to-night
.
Will
you
absolutely
not
dance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
leave
my
place
.
Pansy
must
find
me
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
a
little
.
``
You
're
wonderfully
good
to
her
,
''
he
said
*NL*
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
stared
a
little
and
smiled
.
``
Can
you
imagine
one
's
not
being
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
indeed
.
I
know
how
one
is
charmed
with
her
.
But
you
must
have
done
a
*NL*
great
deal
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
taken
her
out
with
me
,
''
said
Isabel
,
smiling
still
.
``
And
I
've
seen
*NL*
that
she
has
proper
clothes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
society
must
have
been
a
great
benefit
to
her
.
You
've
talked
to
*NL*
her
,
advised
her
,
helped
her
to
develop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
if
she
is
n't
the
rose
she
has
lived
near
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
,
and
her
companion
did
as
much
;
but
there
was
a
certain
*NL*
visible
preoccupation
in
his
face
which
interfered
with
complete
*NL*
hilarity
.
``
We
all
try
to
live
as
near
it
as
we
can
,
''
he
said
after
a
*NL*
moment
's
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
turned
away
;
Pansy
was
about
to
be
restored
to
her
,
and
she
*NL*
welcomed
the
diversion
.
We
know
how
much
she
liked
Lord
Warburton
;
she
*NL*
thought
him
pleasanter
even
than
the
sum
of
his
merits
warranted
;
there
*NL*
was
something
in
his
friendship
that
appeared
a
kind
of
resource
in
case
*NL*
of
indefinite
need
;
it
was
like
having
a
large
balance
at
the
bank
.
She
*NL*
felt
happier
when
he
was
in
the
room
;
there
was
something
reassuring
in
*NL*
his
approach
;
the
sound
of
his
voice
reminded
her
of
the
beneficence
of
*NL*
nature
.
Yet
for
all
that
it
did
n't
suit
her
that
he
should
be
too
near
*NL*
her
,
that
he
should
take
too
much
of
her
good-will
for
granted
.
She
was
*NL*
afraid
of
that
;
she
averted
herself
from
it
;
she
wished
he
would
n't
.
She
*NL*
felt
that
if
he
should
come
too
near
,
as
it
were
,
it
might
be
in
her
to
*NL*
flash
out
and
bid
him
keep
his
distance
.
Pansy
came
back
to
Isabel
with
*NL*
another
rent
in
her
skirt
,
which
was
the
inevitable
consequence
of
the
*NL*
first
and
which
she
displayed
to
Isabel
with
serious
eyes
.
There
were
*NL*
too
many
gentlemen
in
uniform
;
they
wore
those
dreadful
spurs
,
which
*NL*
were
fatal
to
the
dresses
of
little
maids
.
It
hereupon
became
apparent
*NL*
that
the
resources
of
women
are
innumerable
.
Isabel
devoted
herself
*NL*
to
Pansy
's
desecrated
drapery
;
she
fumbled
for
a
pin
and
repaired
the
*NL*
injury
;
she
smiled
and
listened
to
her
account
of
her
adventures
.
Her
*NL*
attention
,
her
sympathy
were
immediate
and
active
;
and
they
were
*NL*
in
direct
proportion
to
a
sentiment
with
which
they
were
in
no
way
*NL*
connected
--
a
lively
conjecture
as
to
whether
Lord
Warburton
might
be
*NL*
trying
to
make
love
to
her
.
It
was
not
simply
his
words
just
then
;
it
*NL*
was
others
as
well
;
it
was
the
reference
and
the
continuity
.
This
was
*NL*
what
she
thought
about
while
she
pinned
up
Pansy
's
dress
.
If
it
were
*NL*
so
,
as
she
feared
,
he
was
of
course
unwitting
;
he
himself
had
not
taken
*NL*
account
of
his
intention
.
But
this
made
it
none
the
more
auspicious
,
*NL*
made
the
situation
none
less
impossible
.
The
sooner
he
should
get
back
*NL*
into
right
relations
with
things
the
better
.
He
immediately
began
*NL*
to
talk
to
Pansy
--
on
whom
it
was
certainly
mystifying
to
see
that
he
*NL*
dropped
a
smile
of
chastened
devotion
.
Pansy
replied
,
as
usual
,
with
a
*NL*
little
air
of
conscientious
aspiration
;
he
had
to
bend
toward
her
a
good
*NL*
deal
in
conversation
,
and
her
eyes
,
as
usual
,
wandered
up
and
down
his
*NL*
robust
person
as
if
he
had
offered
it
to
her
for
exhibition
.
She
always
*NL*
seemed
a
little
frightened
;
yet
her
fright
was
not
of
the
painful
*NL*
character
that
suggests
dislike
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
looked
as
if
she
*NL*
knew
that
he
knew
she
liked
him
.
Isabel
left
them
together
a
little
and
*NL*
wandered
toward
a
friend
whom
she
saw
near
and
with
whom
she
talked
till
*NL*
the
music
of
the
following
dance
began
,
for
which
she
knew
Pansy
to
be
*NL*
also
engaged
.
The
girl
joined
her
presently
,
with
a
little
fluttered
*NL*
flush
,
and
Isabel
,
who
scrupulously
took
Osmond
's
view
of
his
daughter
's
*NL*
complete
dependence
,
consigned
her
,
as
a
precious
and
momentary
loan
,
*NL*
to
her
appointed
partner
.
About
all
this
matter
she
had
her
own
*NL*
imaginations
,
her
own
reserves
;
there
were
moments
when
Pansy
's
extreme
*NL*
adhesiveness
made
each
of
them
,
to
her
sense
,
look
foolish
.
But
Osmond
*NL*
had
given
her
a
sort
of
tableau
of
her
position
as
his
daughter
's
*NL*
duenna
,
which
consisted
of
gracious
alternations
of
concession
and
*NL*
contraction
;
and
there
were
directions
of
his
which
she
liked
to
think
*NL*
she
obeyed
to
the
letter
.
Perhaps
,
as
regards
some
of
them
,
it
was
*NL*
because
her
doing
so
appeared
to
reduce
them
to
the
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Pansy
had
been
led
away
,
she
found
Lord
Warburton
drawing
near
her
*NL*
again
.
She
rested
her
eyes
on
him
steadily
;
she
wished
she
could
sound
*NL*
his
thoughts
.
But
he
had
no
appearance
of
confusion
.
``
She
has
promised
*NL*
to
dance
with
me
later
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
of
that
.
I
suppose
you
've
engaged
her
for
the
cotillion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
he
looked
a
little
awkward
.
``
No
,
I
did
n't
ask
her
for
that
.
It
's
*NL*
a
quadrille
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
're
not
clever
!
''
said
Isabel
almost
angrily
.
``
I
told
her
to
keep
*NL*
the
cotillion
in
case
you
should
ask
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
maid
,
fancy
that
!
''
And
Lord
Warburton
laughed
frankly
.
``
Of
*NL*
course
I
will
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
like
?
Oh
,
if
you
dance
with
her
only
because
I
like
it
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
bore
her
.
She
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
young
fellows
on
her
*NL*
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
dropped
her
eyes
,
reflecting
rapidly
;
Lord
Warburton
stood
there
*NL*
looking
at
her
and
she
felt
his
eyes
on
her
face
.
She
felt
much
inclined
*NL*
to
ask
him
to
remove
them
.
She
did
n't
do
so
,
however
;
she
only
said
to
*NL*
him
,
after
a
minute
,
with
her
own
raised
:
``
Please
let
me
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Understand
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
me
ten
days
ago
that
you
'd
like
to
marry
my
stepdaughter
.
*NL*
You
've
not
forgotten
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgotten
it
?
I
wrote
to
Mr.
Osmond
about
it
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
he
did
n't
mention
to
me
that
he
had
heard
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
stammered
a
little
.
``
I
--
I
did
n't
send
my
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
forgot
THAT
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
was
n't
satisfied
with
it
.
It
's
an
awkward
sort
of
letter
to
*NL*
write
,
you
know
.
But
I
shall
send
it
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
later
,
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
.
You
still
wish
then
to
marry
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
afraid
that
you
'll
bore
her
?
''
And
as
her
companion
stared
at
*NL*
this
enquiry
Isabel
added
:
``
If
she
ca
n't
dance
with
you
for
half
an
hour
*NL*
how
will
she
be
able
to
dance
with
you
for
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
readily
,
``
I
'll
let
her
dance
with
other
*NL*
people
!
About
the
cotillion
,
the
fact
is
I
thought
that
you
--
that
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
would
do
it
with
you
?
I
told
you
I
'd
do
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
;
so
that
while
it
's
going
on
I
might
find
some
quiet
corner
*NL*
where
we
may
sit
down
and
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Isabel
gravely
,
``
you
're
much
too
considerate
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
cotillion
came
Pansy
was
found
to
have
engaged
herself
,
*NL*
thinking
,
in
perfect
humility
,
that
Lord
Warburton
had
no
intentions
.
*NL*
Isabel
recommended
him
to
seek
another
partner
,
but
he
assured
her
that
*NL*
he
would
dance
with
no
one
but
herself
.
As
,
however
,
she
had
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
remonstrances
of
her
hostess
,
declined
other
invitations
on
the
*NL*
ground
that
she
was
not
dancing
at
all
,
it
was
not
possible
for
her
to
*NL*
make
an
exception
in
Lord
Warburton
's
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
I
do
n't
care
to
dance
,
''
he
said
;
``
it
's
a
barbarous
amusement
:
*NL*
I
'd
much
rather
talk
.
''
And
he
intimated
that
he
had
discovered
exactly
*NL*
the
corner
he
had
been
looking
for
--
a
quiet
nook
in
one
of
the
smaller
*NL*
rooms
,
where
the
music
would
come
to
them
faintly
and
not
interfere
*NL*
with
conversation
.
Isabel
had
decided
to
let
him
carry
out
his
idea
;
she
*NL*
wished
to
be
satisfied
.
She
wandered
away
from
the
ball-room
with
him
,
*NL*
though
she
knew
her
husband
desired
she
should
not
lose
sight
of
his
*NL*
daughter
.
It
was
with
his
daughter
's
pretendant
,
however
;
that
would
*NL*
make
it
right
for
Osmond
.
On
her
way
out
of
the
ball-room
she
came
upon
*NL*
Edward
Rosier
,
who
was
standing
in
a
doorway
,
with
folded
arms
,
looking
*NL*
at
the
dance
in
the
attitude
of
a
young
man
without
illusions
.
She
*NL*
stopped
a
moment
and
asked
him
if
he
were
not
dancing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
if
I
ca
n't
dance
with
HER
!
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
go
away
then
,
''
said
Isabel
with
the
manner
of
good
*NL*
counsel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
go
till
she
does
!
''
And
he
let
Lord
Warburton
pass
without
*NL*
giving
him
a
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
nobleman
,
however
,
had
noticed
the
melancholy
youth
,
and
he
*NL*
asked
Isabel
who
her
dismal
friend
was
,
remarking
that
he
had
seen
him
*NL*
somewhere
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
young
man
I
've
told
you
about
,
who
's
in
love
with
Pansy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
I
remember
.
He
looks
rather
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
reason
.
My
husband
wo
n't
listen
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
him
?
''
Lord
Warburton
enquired
.
``
He
seems
very
*NL*
harmless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
n't
money
enough
,
and
he
is
n't
very
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
listened
with
interest
;
he
seemed
struck
with
this
*NL*
account
of
Edward
Rosier
.
``
Dear
me
;
he
looked
a
well-set-up
young
*NL*
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
he
is
,
but
my
husband
's
very
particular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
see
.
''
And
Lord
Warburton
paused
a
moment
.
``
How
much
money
has
he
*NL*
got
?
''
he
then
ventured
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sixteen
hundred
pounds
?
Ah
,
but
that
's
very
good
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
think
.
My
husband
,
however
,
has
larger
ideas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
've
noticed
that
your
husband
has
very
large
ideas
.
Is
he
really
*NL*
an
idiot
,
the
young
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
idiot
?
Not
in
the
least
;
he
's
charming
.
When
he
was
twelve
years
old
*NL*
I
myself
was
in
love
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
look
much
more
than
twelve
to-day
,
''
Lord
Warburton
rejoined
*NL*
vaguely
,
looking
about
him
.
Then
with
more
point
,
``
Do
n't
you
think
we
*NL*
might
sit
here
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wherever
you
please
.
''
The
room
was
a
sort
of
boudoir
,
pervaded
by
a
*NL*
subdued
,
rose-coloured
light
;
a
lady
and
gentleman
moved
out
of
it
as
*NL*
our
friends
came
in
.
``
It
's
very
kind
of
you
to
take
such
an
interest
in
*NL*
Mr.
Rosier
,
''
Isabel
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
seems
to
me
rather
ill-treated
.
He
had
a
face
a
yard
long
.
I
*NL*
wondered
what
ailed
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
just
man
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
You
've
a
kind
thought
even
for
a
*NL*
rival
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
suddenly
turned
with
a
stare
.
``
A
rival
!
Do
you
call
him
*NL*
my
rival
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
--
if
you
both
wish
to
marry
the
same
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
but
since
he
has
no
chance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
you
,
however
that
may
be
,
for
putting
your
self
in
his
place
.
It
*NL*
shows
imagination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
me
for
it
?
''
And
Lord
Warburton
looked
at
her
with
an
uncertain
*NL*
eye
.
``
I
think
you
mean
you
're
laughing
at
me
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
laughing
at
you
a
little
.
But
I
like
you
as
somebody
to
laugh
*NL*
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well
,
then
,
let
me
enter
into
his
situation
a
little
more
.
What
do
*NL*
you
suppose
one
could
do
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
I
have
been
praising
your
imagination
I
'll
leave
you
to
imagine
*NL*
that
yourself
,
''
Isabel
said
.
``
Pansy
too
would
like
you
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Osmond
?
Ah
,
she
,
I
flatter
myself
,
likes
me
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
a
little
;
he
was
still
questioning
her
face
.
``
Well
then
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
understand
you
.
You
do
n't
mean
that
she
cares
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
quick
blush
sprang
to
his
brow
.
``
You
told
me
she
would
have
no
wish
*NL*
apart
from
her
father
's
,
and
as
I
've
gathered
that
he
would
favour
*NL*
me
--
!
''
He
paused
a
little
and
then
suggested
``
Do
n't
you
see
?
''
through
*NL*
his
blush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
told
you
she
has
an
immense
wish
to
please
her
father
,
and
that
*NL*
it
would
probably
take
her
very
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
seems
to
me
a
very
proper
feeling
,
''
said
Lord
Warburton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
;
it
's
a
very
proper
feeling
.
''
Isabel
remained
silent
for
some
*NL*
moments
;
the
room
continued
empty
;
the
sound
of
the
music
reached
them
*NL*
with
its
richness
softened
by
the
interposing
apartments
.
Then
at
last
*NL*
she
said
:
``
But
it
hardly
strikes
me
as
the
sort
of
feeling
to
which
a
*NL*
man
would
wish
to
be
indebted
for
a
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
;
if
the
wife
's
a
good
one
and
he
thinks
she
does
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
you
must
think
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
;
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
You
call
that
very
British
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
.
I
think
Pansy
would
do
wonderfully
well
to
marry
you
,
*NL*
and
I
do
n't
know
who
should
know
it
better
than
you
.
But
you
're
not
in
*NL*
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
I
am
,
Mrs.
Osmond
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
shook
her
head
.
``
You
like
to
think
you
are
while
you
sit
here
*NL*
with
me
.
But
that
's
not
how
you
strike
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
like
the
young
man
in
the
doorway
.
I
admit
that
.
But
what
makes
*NL*
it
so
unnatural
?
Could
any
one
in
the
world
be
more
loveable
than
Miss
*NL*
Osmond
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
,
possibly
.
But
love
has
nothing
to
do
with
good
reasons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
.
I
'm
delighted
to
have
good
reasons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
are
.
If
you
were
really
in
love
you
would
n't
care
a
straw
*NL*
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
really
in
love
--
really
in
love
!
''
Lord
Warburton
exclaimed
,
folding
*NL*
his
arms
,
leaning
back
his
head
and
stretching
himself
a
little
.
``
You
*NL*
must
remember
that
I
'm
forty-two
years
old
.
I
wo
n't
pretend
I
'm
as
I
*NL*
once
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
're
sure
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
it
's
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
nothing
;
he
sat
there
,
with
his
head
back
,
looking
before
*NL*
him
.
Abruptly
,
however
,
he
changed
his
position
;
he
turned
quickly
to
*NL*
his
friend
.
``
Why
are
you
so
unwilling
,
so
sceptical
?
''
She
met
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
for
a
moment
they
looked
straight
at
each
other
.
If
she
wished
to
*NL*
be
satisfied
she
saw
something
that
satisfied
her
;
she
saw
in
his
*NL*
expression
the
gleam
of
an
idea
that
she
was
uneasy
on
her
own
*NL*
account
--
that
she
was
perhaps
even
in
fear
.
It
showed
a
suspicion
,
not
a
*NL*
hope
,
but
such
as
it
was
it
told
her
what
she
wanted
to
know
.
Not
for
an
*NL*
instant
should
he
suspect
her
of
detecting
in
his
proposal
of
marrying
*NL*
her
step-daughter
an
implication
of
increased
nearness
to
herself
,
or
*NL*
of
thinking
it
,
on
such
a
betrayal
,
ominous
.
In
that
brief
,
extremely
*NL*
personal
gaze
,
however
,
deeper
meanings
passed
between
them
than
they
*NL*
were
conscious
of
at
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Lord
Warburton
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
,
``
you
may
do
,
so
far
as
I
'm
*NL*
concerned
,
whatever
comes
into
your
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
this
she
got
up
and
wandered
into
the
adjoining
room
,
where
,
*NL*
within
her
companion
's
view
,
she
was
immediately
addressed
by
a
pair
of
*NL*
gentlemen
,
high
personages
in
the
Roman
world
,
who
met
her
as
if
they
*NL*
had
been
looking
for
her
.
While
she
talked
with
them
she
found
herself
*NL*
regretting
she
had
moved
;
it
looked
a
little
like
running
away
--
all
the
*NL*
more
as
Lord
Warburton
did
n't
follow
her
.
She
was
glad
of
this
,
however
,
*NL*
and
at
any
rate
she
was
satisfied
.
She
was
so
well
satisfied
that
*NL*
when
,
in
passing
back
into
the
ball-room
,
she
found
Edward
Rosier
still
*NL*
planted
in
the
doorway
,
she
stopped
and
spoke
to
him
again
.
``
You
did
*NL*
right
not
to
go
away
.
I
've
some
comfort
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
it
,
''
the
young
man
softly
wailed
,
``
when
I
see
you
so
awfully
*NL*
thick
with
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
of
him
;
I
'll
do
what
I
can
for
you
.
I
'm
afraid
it
wo
n't
be
*NL*
much
,
but
what
I
can
I
'll
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
with
gloomy
obliqueness
.
``
What
has
suddenly
brought
you
*NL*
round
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sense
that
you
are
an
inconvenience
in
doorways
!
''
she
answered
,
*NL*
smiling
as
she
passed
him
.
Half
an
hour
later
she
took
leave
,
with
*NL*
Pansy
,
and
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
the
two
ladies
,
with
many
*NL*
other
departing
guests
,
waited
a
while
for
their
carriage
.
Just
as
it
*NL*
approached
Lord
Warburton
came
out
of
the
house
and
assisted
them
to
*NL*
reach
their
vehicle
.
He
stood
a
moment
at
the
door
,
asking
Pansy
if
*NL*
she
had
amused
herself
;
and
she
,
having
answered
him
,
fell
back
with
a
*NL*
little
air
of
fatigue
.
Then
Isabel
,
at
the
window
,
detaining
him
by
*NL*
a
movement
of
her
finger
,
murmured
gently
:
``
Do
n't
forget
to
send
your
*NL*
letter
to
her
father
!

CHAPTER
XLIV
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
Gemini
was
often
extremely
bored
--
bored
,
in
her
own
phrase
,
*NL*
to
extinction
.
She
had
not
been
extinguished
,
however
,
and
she
*NL*
struggled
bravely
enough
with
her
destiny
,
which
had
been
to
marry
an
*NL*
unaccommodating
Florentine
who
insisted
upon
living
in
his
native
town
,
*NL*
where
he
enjoyed
such
consideration
as
might
attach
to
a
gentleman
whose
*NL*
talent
for
losing
at
cards
had
not
the
merit
of
being
incidental
to
an
*NL*
obliging
disposition
.
The
Count
Gemini
was
not
liked
even
by
those
who
*NL*
won
from
him
;
and
he
bore
a
name
which
,
having
a
measurable
value
in
*NL*
Florence
,
was
,
like
the
local
coin
of
the
old
Italian
states
,
without
*NL*
currency
in
other
parts
of
the
peninsula
.
In
Rome
he
was
simply
a
very
*NL*
dull
Florentine
,
and
it
is
not
remarkable
that
he
should
not
have
cared
*NL*
to
pay
frequent
visits
to
a
place
where
,
to
carry
it
off
,
his
dulness
*NL*
needed
more
explanation
than
was
convenient
.
The
Countess
lived
with
her
*NL*
eyes
upon
Rome
,
and
it
was
the
constant
grievance
of
her
life
that
she
*NL*
had
not
an
habitation
there
.
She
was
ashamed
to
say
how
seldom
she
had
*NL*
been
allowed
to
visit
that
city
;
it
scarcely
made
the
matter
better
that
*NL*
there
were
other
members
of
the
Florentine
nobility
who
never
had
been
*NL*
there
at
all
.
She
went
whenever
she
could
;
that
was
all
she
could
say
.
*NL*
Or
rather
not
all
,
but
all
she
said
she
could
say
.
In
fact
she
had
much
*NL*
more
to
say
about
it
,
and
had
often
set
forth
the
reasons
why
she
hated
*NL*
Florence
and
wished
to
end
her
days
in
the
shadow
of
Saint
Peter
's
.
They
*NL*
are
reasons
,
however
,
that
do
not
closely
concern
us
,
and
were
usually
*NL*
summed
up
in
the
declaration
that
Rome
,
in
short
,
was
the
Eternal
City
*NL*
and
that
Florence
was
simply
a
pretty
little
place
like
any
other
.
The
*NL*
Countess
apparently
needed
to
connect
the
idea
of
eternity
with
*NL*
her
amusements
.
She
was
convinced
that
society
was
infinitely
more
*NL*
interesting
in
Rome
,
where
you
met
celebrities
all
winter
at
evening
*NL*
parties
.
At
Florence
there
were
no
celebrities
;
none
at
least
that
one
*NL*
had
heard
of
.
Since
her
brother
's
marriage
her
impatience
had
greatly
*NL*
increased
;
she
was
so
sure
his
wife
had
a
more
brilliant
life
than
*NL*
herself
.
She
was
not
so
intellectual
as
Isabel
,
but
she
was
intellectual
*NL*
enough
to
do
justice
to
Rome
--
not
to
the
ruins
and
the
catacombs
,
not
*NL*
even
perhaps
to
the
monuments
and
museums
,
the
church
ceremonies
and
the
*NL*
scenery
;
but
certainly
to
all
the
rest
.
She
heard
a
great
deal
about
*NL*
her
sister-in-law
and
knew
perfectly
that
Isabel
was
having
a
beautiful
*NL*
time
.
She
had
indeed
seen
it
for
herself
on
the
only
occasion
on
which
*NL*
she
had
enjoyed
the
hospitality
of
Palazzo
Roccanera
.
She
had
spent
a
*NL*
week
there
during
the
first
winter
of
her
brother
's
marriage
,
but
she
*NL*
had
not
been
encouraged
to
renew
this
satisfaction
.
Osmond
did
n't
want
*NL*
her
--
that
she
was
perfectly
aware
of
;
but
she
would
have
gone
all
the
*NL*
same
,
for
after
all
she
did
n't
care
two
straws
about
Osmond
.
It
was
*NL*
her
husband
who
would
n't
let
her
,
and
the
money
question
was
always
*NL*
a
trouble
.
Isabel
had
been
very
nice
;
the
Countess
,
who
had
liked
her
*NL*
sister-in-law
from
the
first
,
had
not
been
blinded
by
envy
to
Isabel
's
*NL*
personal
merits
.
She
had
always
observed
that
she
got
on
better
with
*NL*
clever
women
than
with
silly
ones
like
herself
;
the
silly
ones
could
*NL*
never
understand
her
wisdom
,
whereas
the
clever
ones
--
the
really
*NL*
clever
ones
--
always
understood
her
silliness
.
It
appeared
to
her
that
,
*NL*
different
as
they
were
in
appearance
and
general
style
,
Isabel
and
she
*NL*
had
somewhere
a
patch
of
common
ground
that
they
would
set
their
feet
*NL*
upon
at
last
.
It
was
not
very
large
,
but
it
was
firm
,
and
they
should
*NL*
both
know
it
when
once
they
had
really
touched
it
.
And
then
she
lived
,
*NL*
with
Mrs.
Osmond
,
under
the
influence
of
a
pleasant
surprise
;
she
was
*NL*
constantly
expecting
that
Isabel
would
``
look
down
''
on
her
,
and
she
as
*NL*
constantly
saw
this
operation
postponed
.
She
asked
herself
when
it
would
*NL*
begin
,
like
fire-works
,
or
Lent
,
or
the
opera
season
;
not
that
she
*NL*
cared
much
,
but
she
wondered
what
kept
it
in
abeyance
.
Her
sister-in-law
*NL*
regarded
her
with
none
but
level
glances
and
expressed
for
the
poor
*NL*
Countess
as
little
contempt
as
admiration
.
In
reality
Isabel
would
as
*NL*
soon
have
thought
of
despising
her
as
of
passing
a
moral
judgement
on
a
*NL*
grasshopper
.
She
was
not
indifferent
to
her
husband
's
sister
,
however
;
*NL*
she
was
rather
a
little
afraid
of
her
.
She
wondered
at
her
;
she
thought
*NL*
her
very
extraordinary
.
The
Countess
seemed
to
her
to
have
no
soul
;
she
*NL*
was
like
a
bright
rare
shell
,
with
a
polished
surface
and
a
remarkably
*NL*
pink
lip
,
in
which
something
would
rattle
when
you
shook
it
.
This
rattle
*NL*
was
apparently
the
Countess
's
spiritual
principle
,
a
little
loose
nut
*NL*
that
tumbled
about
inside
of
her
.
She
was
too
odd
for
disdain
,
too
*NL*
anomalous
for
comparisons
.
Isabel
would
have
invited
her
again
-LRB-
there
*NL*
was
no
question
of
inviting
the
Count
-RRB-
;
but
Osmond
,
after
his
marriage
,
*NL*
had
not
scrupled
to
say
frankly
that
Amy
was
a
fool
of
the
worst
*NL*
species
--
a
fool
whose
folly
had
the
irrepressibility
of
genius
.
He
said
*NL*
at
another
time
that
she
had
no
heart
;
and
he
added
in
a
moment
that
she
*NL*
had
given
it
all
away
--
in
small
pieces
,
like
a
frosted
wedding-cake
.
*NL*
The
fact
of
not
having
been
asked
was
of
course
another
obstacle
to
*NL*
the
Countess
's
going
again
to
Rome
;
but
at
the
period
with
which
this
*NL*
history
has
now
to
deal
she
was
in
receipt
of
an
invitation
to
spend
*NL*
several
weeks
at
Palazzo
Roccanera
.
The
proposal
had
come
from
Osmond
*NL*
himself
,
who
wrote
to
his
sister
that
she
must
be
prepared
to
be
very
*NL*
quiet
.
Whether
or
no
she
found
in
this
phrase
all
the
meaning
he
had
*NL*
put
into
it
I
am
unable
to
say
;
but
she
accepted
the
invitation
on
any
*NL*
terms
.
She
was
curious
,
moreover
;
for
one
of
the
impressions
of
her
*NL*
former
visit
had
been
that
her
brother
had
found
his
match
.
Before
the
*NL*
marriage
she
had
been
sorry
for
Isabel
,
so
sorry
as
to
have
had
serious
*NL*
thoughts
--
if
any
of
the
Countess
's
thoughts
were
serious
--
of
putting
*NL*
her
on
her
guard
.
But
she
had
let
that
pass
,
and
after
a
little
she
was
*NL*
reassured
.
Osmond
was
as
lofty
as
ever
,
but
his
wife
would
not
be
an
*NL*
easy
victim
.
The
Countess
was
not
very
exact
at
measurements
,
but
it
*NL*
seemed
to
her
that
if
Isabel
should
draw
herself
up
she
would
be
the
*NL*
taller
spirit
of
the
two
.
What
she
wanted
to
learn
now
was
whether
*NL*
Isabel
had
drawn
herself
up
;
it
would
give
her
immense
pleasure
to
see
*NL*
Osmond
overtopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
days
before
she
was
to
start
for
Rome
a
servant
brought
her
the
*NL*
card
of
a
visitor
--
a
card
with
the
simple
superscription
``
Henrietta
C.
*NL*
Stackpole
.
''
The
Countess
pressed
her
finger-tips
to
her
forehead
;
she
*NL*
did
n't
remember
to
have
known
any
such
Henrietta
as
that
.
The
servant
*NL*
then
remarked
that
the
lady
had
requested
him
to
say
that
if
the
*NL*
Countess
should
not
recognise
her
name
she
would
know
her
well
enough
on
*NL*
seeing
her
.
By
the
time
she
appeared
before
her
visitor
she
had
in
fact
*NL*
reminded
herself
that
there
was
once
a
literary
lady
at
Mrs.
Touchett
's
;
*NL*
the
only
woman
of
letters
she
had
ever
encountered
--
that
is
the
only
*NL*
modern
one
,
since
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
defunct
poetess
.
She
*NL*
recognised
Miss
Stackpole
immediately
,
the
more
so
that
Miss
Stackpole
*NL*
seemed
perfectly
unchanged
;
and
the
Countess
,
who
was
thoroughly
*NL*
good-natured
,
thought
it
rather
fine
to
be
called
on
by
a
person
of
that
*NL*
sort
of
distinction
.
She
wondered
if
Miss
Stackpole
had
come
on
account
*NL*
of
her
mother
--
whether
she
had
heard
of
the
American
Corinne
.
Her
mother
*NL*
was
not
at
all
like
Isabel
's
friend
;
the
Countess
could
see
at
a
*NL*
glance
that
this
lady
was
much
more
contemporary
;
and
she
received
*NL*
an
impression
of
the
improvements
that
were
taking
place
--
chiefly
in
*NL*
distant
countries
--
in
the
character
-LRB-
the
professional
character
-RRB-
of
*NL*
literary
ladies
.
Her
mother
had
been
used
to
wear
a
Roman
scarf
thrown
*NL*
over
a
pair
of
shoulders
timorously
bared
of
their
tight
black
velvet
*NL*
-LRB-
oh
the
old
clothes
!
-RRB-
and
a
gold
laurel-wreath
set
upon
a
multitude
of
*NL*
glossy
ringlets
.
She
had
spoken
softly
and
vaguely
,
with
the
accent
of
*NL*
her
``
Creole
''
ancestors
,
as
she
always
confessed
;
she
sighed
a
great
deal
*NL*
and
was
not
at
all
enterprising
.
But
Henrietta
,
the
Countess
could
see
,
*NL*
was
always
closely
buttoned
and
compactly
braided
;
there
was
something
*NL*
brisk
and
business-like
in
her
appearance
;
her
manner
was
almost
*NL*
conscientiously
familiar
.
It
was
as
impossible
to
imagine
her
ever
*NL*
vaguely
sighing
as
to
imagine
a
letter
posted
without
its
address
.
The
*NL*
Countess
could
not
but
feel
that
the
correspondent
of
the
Interviewer
*NL*
was
much
more
in
the
movement
than
the
American
Corinne
.
She
explained
*NL*
that
she
had
called
on
the
Countess
because
she
was
the
only
person
she
*NL*
knew
in
Florence
,
and
that
when
she
visited
a
foreign
city
she
liked
to
*NL*
see
something
more
than
superficial
travellers
.
She
knew
Mrs.
Touchett
,
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Touchett
was
in
America
,
and
even
if
she
had
been
in
Florence
*NL*
Henrietta
would
not
have
put
herself
out
for
her
,
since
Mrs.
Touchett
*NL*
was
not
one
of
her
admirations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
by
that
that
I
am
?
''
the
Countess
graciously
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
like
you
better
than
I
do
her
,
''
said
Miss
Stackpole
.
``
I
seem
to
*NL*
remember
that
when
I
saw
you
before
you
were
very
interesting
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
whether
it
was
an
accident
or
whether
it
's
your
usual
style
.
At
*NL*
any
rate
I
was
a
good
deal
struck
with
what
you
said
.
I
made
use
of
it
*NL*
afterwards
in
print
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
cried
the
Countess
,
staring
and
half-alarmed
;
``
I
had
no
idea
*NL*
I
ever
said
anything
remarkable
!
I
wish
I
had
known
it
at
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
about
the
position
of
woman
in
this
city
,
''
Miss
Stackpole
*NL*
remarked
.
``
You
threw
a
good
deal
of
light
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
position
of
woman
's
very
uncomfortable
.
Is
that
what
you
mean
?
And
*NL*
you
wrote
it
down
and
published
it
?
''
the
Countess
went
on
.
``
Ah
,
do
let
*NL*
me
see
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
write
to
them
to
send
you
the
paper
if
you
like
,
''
Henrietta
said
.
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mention
your
name
;
I
only
said
a
lady
of
high
rank
.
And
then
I
*NL*
quoted
your
views
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
threw
herself
hastily
backward
,
tossing
up
her
clasped
*NL*
hands
.
``
Do
you
know
I
'm
rather
sorry
you
did
n't
mention
my
name
?
I
*NL*
should
have
rather
liked
to
see
my
name
in
the
papers

I
forget
what
my
*NL*
views
were
;
I
have
so
many
!
But
I
'm
not
ashamed
of
them
.
I
'm
not
at
all
*NL*
like
my
brother
--
I
suppose
you
know
my
brother
?
He
thinks
it
a
kind
of
*NL*
scandal
to
be
put
in
the
papers
;
if
you
were
to
quote
him
he
'd
never
*NL*
forgive
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
need
n't
be
afraid
;
I
shall
never
refer
to
him

''
said
Miss
Stackpole
*NL*
with
bland
dryness
.
``
That
's
another
reason
,

she
added
,
``
why
I
wanted
to
*NL*
come
to
see
you

Osmond

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
quite
willing
to
be

Henrietta
declared
.
``

*NL*
``
Do

the

*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
sprang
from
her
chair
and
came
and
sat
on
the
sofa
beside

her
visitor

Henrietta

became
immense

gazing

in
silence
at

pregnantly

I
know
*NL*
very
little
;
I
see
and
hear
very
little
of
Osmond
.
He
does
n't
like
me
*NL*
any
better
than
he
appears
to
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
're
not
a
lady
correspondent
,
''
said
Henrietta
pensively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
has
plenty
of
reasons
.
Nevertheless
they
've
invited
me
--
I
'm
*NL*
to
stay
in
the
house
!
''
And
the
Countess
smiled
almost
fiercely
;
her
*NL*
exultation
,
for
the
moment
,
took
little
account
of
Miss
Stackpole
's
*NL*
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
lady
,
however
,
regarded
it
very
placidly
.
``
I
should
n't
have
gone
if
*NL*
she
HAD
asked
me
.
That
is
I
think
I
should
n't
;
and
I
'm
glad
I
had
n't
*NL*
to
make
up
my
mind
.
It
would
have
been
a
very
difficult
question
.
I
*NL*
should
n't
have
liked
to
turn
away
from
her
,
and
yet
I
should
n't
have
*NL*
been
happy
under
her
roof
.
A
pension
will
suit
me
very
well
.
But
that
's
*NL*
not
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rome
's
very
good
just
now
,
''
said
the
Countess
;
``
there
are
all
sorts
of
*NL*
brilliant
people
.
Did
you
ever
hear
of
Lord
Warburton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
of
him
?
I
know
him
very
well
.
Do
you
consider
him
very
brilliant
?
''
*NL*
Henrietta
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
him
,
but
I
'm
told
he
's
extremely
grand
seigneur
.
He
's
*NL*
making
love
to
Isabel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Making
love
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
'm
told
;
I
do
n't
know
the
details
,
''
said
the
Countess
lightly
.
``
But
*NL*
Isabel
's
pretty
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
gazed
earnestly
at
her
companion
;
for
a
moment
she
said
*NL*
nothing
.
``
When
do
you
go
to
Rome
?
''
she
enquired
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
a
week
,
I
'm
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
go
to-morrow
,
''
Henrietta
said
.
``
I
think
I
had
better
not
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
I
'm
sorry
;
I
'm
having
some
dresses
made
.
I
'm
told
Isabel
*NL*
receives
immensely
.
But
I
shall
see
you
there
;
I
shall
call
on
you
*NL*
at
your
pension
.
''
Henrietta
sat
still
--
she
was
lost
in
thought
;
and
*NL*
suddenly
the
Countess
cried
:
``
Ah
,
but
if
you
do
n't
go
with
me
you
ca
n't
*NL*
describe
our
journey
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
seemed
unmoved
by
this
consideration
;
she
was
thinking
*NL*
of
something
else
and
presently
expressed
it
.
``
I
'm
not
sure
that
I
*NL*
understand
you
about
Lord
Warburton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Understand
me
?
I
mean
he
's
very
nice
,
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
consider
it
nice
to
make
love
to
married
women
?
''
Henrietta
*NL*
enquired
with
unprecedented
distinctness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
stared
,
and
then
with
a
little
violent
laugh
:
``
It
's
certain
*NL*
all
the
nice
men
do
it
.
Get
married
and
you
'll
see
!
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
idea
would
be
enough
to
prevent
me
,
''
said
Miss
Stackpole
.
``
I
*NL*
should
want
my
own
husband
;
I
should
n't
want
any
one
else
's
.
Do
you
mean
*NL*
that
Isabel
's
guilty
--
guilty
--
?
''
And
she
paused
a
little
,
choosing
her
*NL*
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
mean
she
's
guilty
?
Oh
dear
no
,
not
yet
,
I
hope
.
I
only
mean
that
*NL*
Osmond
's
very
tiresome
and
that
Lord
Warburton
,
as
I
hear
,
is
a
great
*NL*
deal
at
the
house
.
I
'm
afraid
you
're
scandalised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
just
anxious
,
''
Henrietta
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
're
not
very
complimentary
to
Isabel
!
You
should
have
more
*NL*
confidence
.
I
'll
tell
you
,
''
the
Countess
added
quickly
:
``
if
it
will
be
a
*NL*
comfort
to
you
I
engage
to
draw
him
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
answered
at
first
only
with
the
deeper
solemnity
of
her
*NL*
gaze
.
``
You
do
n't
understand
me
,
''
she
said
after
a
while
.
``
I
have
n't
the
*NL*
idea
you
seem
to
suppose
.
I
'm
not
afraid
for
Isabel
--
in
that
way
.
I
'm
*NL*
only
afraid
she
's
unhappy
--
that
's
what
I
want
to
get
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
gave
a
dozen
turns
of
the
head
;
she
looked
impatient
and
*NL*
sarcastic
.
``
That
may
very
well
be
;
for
my
part
I
should
like
to
know
*NL*
whether
Osmond
is
.
''
Miss
Stackpole
had
begun
a
little
to
bore
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
's
really
changed
that
must
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
''
Henrietta
*NL*
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
see
;
she
'll
tell
you
,
''
said
the
Countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
she
may
NOT
tell
me
--
that
's
what
I
'm
afraid
of
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
Osmond
is
n't
amusing
himself
--
in
his
own
old
way
--
I
flatter
*NL*
myself
I
shall
discover
it
,
''
the
Countess
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
for
that
,
''
said
Henrietta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
immensely
!
If
Isabel
's
unhappy
I
'm
very
sorry
for
her
,
but
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
it
.
I
might
tell
her
something
that
would
make
her
worse
,
but
I
*NL*
ca
n't
tell
her
anything
that
would
console
her
.
What
did
she
go
and
*NL*
marry
him
for
?
If
she
had
listened
to
me
she
'd
have
got
rid
of
him
.
I
'll
*NL*
forgive
her
,
however
,
if
I
find
she
has
made
things
hot
for
him
!
If
she
*NL*
has
simply
allowed
him
to
trample
upon
her
I
do
n't
know
that
I
shall
*NL*
even
pity
her
.
But
I
do
n't
think
that
's
very
likely
.
I
count
upon
*NL*
finding
that
if
she
's
miserable
she
has
at
least
made
HIM
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
got
up
;
these
seemed
to
her
,
naturally
,
very
dreadful
*NL*
expectations
.
She
honestly
believed
she
had
no
desire
to
see
Mr.
Osmond
*NL*
unhappy
;
and
indeed
he
could
not
be
for
her
the
subject
of
a
flight
of
*NL*
fancy
.
She
was
on
the
whole
rather
disappointed
in
the
Countess
,
whose
*NL*
mind
moved
in
a
narrower
circle
than
she
had
imagined
,
though
with
a
*NL*
capacity
for
coarseness
even
there
.
``
It
will
be
better
if
they
love
each
*NL*
other
,
''
she
said
for
edification
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ca
n't
.
He
ca
n't
love
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
presumed
that
was
the
case
.
But
it
only
aggravates
my
fear
for
*NL*
Isabel
.
I
shall
positively
start
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Isabel
certainly
has
devotees
,
''
said
the
Countess
,
smiling
very
*NL*
vividly
.
``
I
declare
I
do
n't
pity
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
I
ca
n't
assist
her
,
''
Miss
Stackpole
pursued
,
as
if
it
were
*NL*
well
not
to
have
illusions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
have
wanted
to
,
at
any
rate
;
that
's
something
.
I
believe
that
's
*NL*
what
you
came
from
America
for
,
''
the
Countess
suddenly
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
wanted
to
look
after
her
,
''
Henrietta
said
serenely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
hostess
stood
there
smiling
at
her
with
small
bright
eyes
and
an
*NL*
eager-looking
nose
;
with
cheeks
into
each
of
which
a
flush
had
come
.
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
very
pretty
c'est
bien
gentil
!
Is
n't
it
what
they
call
*NL*
friendship
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
they
call
it
.
I
thought
I
had
better
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
very
happy
--
she
's
very
fortunate
,
''
the
Countess
went
on
.
``
She
*NL*
has
others
besides
.
''
And
then
she
broke
out
passionately
.
``
She
's
more
*NL*
fortunate
than
I
!
I
'm
as
unhappy
as
she
--
I
've
a
very
bad
husband
;
he
's
a
*NL*
great
deal
worse
than
Osmond
.
And
I
've
no
friends
.
I
thought
I
had
,
but
*NL*
they
're
gone
.
No
one
,
man
or
woman
,
would
do
for
me
what
you
've
done
for
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
was
touched
;
there
was
nature
in
this
bitter
effusion
.
She
*NL*
gazed
at
her
companion
a
moment
,
and
then
:
``
Look
here
,
Countess
,
I
'll
do
*NL*
anything
for
you
that
you
like
.
I
'll
wait
over
and
travel
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
the
Countess
answered
with
a
quick
change
of
tone
:
``
only
*NL*
describe
me
in
the
newspaper
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
,
before
leaving
her
,
however
,
was
obliged
to
make
her
*NL*
understand
that
she
could
give
no
fictitious
representation
of
her
*NL*
journey
to
Rome
.
Miss
Stackpole
was
a
strictly
veracious
reporter
.
On
*NL*
quitting
her
she
took
the
way
to
the
Lung
'
Arno
,
the
sunny
quay
beside
*NL*
the
yellow
river
where
the
bright-faced
inns
familiar
to
tourists
stand
*NL*
all
in
a
row
.
She
had
learned
her
way
before
this
through
the
streets
of
*NL*
Florence
-LRB-
she
was
very
quick
in
such
matters
-RRB-
,
and
was
therefore
able
*NL*
to
turn
with
great
decision
of
step
out
of
the
little
square
which
forms
*NL*
the
approach
to
the
bridge
of
the
Holy
Trinity
.
She
proceeded
to
the
*NL*
left
,
toward
the
Ponte
Vecchio
,
and
stopped
in
front
of
one
of
the
*NL*
hotels
which
overlook
that
delightful
structure
.
Here
she
drew
forth
*NL*
a
small
pocket-book
,
took
from
it
a
card
and
a
pencil
and
,
after
*NL*
meditating
a
moment
,
wrote
a
few
words
.
It
is
our
privilege
to
look
over
*NL*
her
shoulder
,
and
if
we
exercise
it
we
may
read
the
brief
query
:
``
Could
*NL*
I
see
you
this
evening
for
a
few
moments
on
a
very
important
matter
?
''
*NL*
Henrietta
added
that
she
should
start
on
the
morrow
for
Rome
.
Armed
with
*NL*
this
little
document
she
approached
the
porter
,
who
now
had
taken
up
*NL*
his
station
in
the
doorway
,
and
asked
if
Mr.
Goodwood
were
at
home
.
*NL*
The
porter
replied
,
as
porters
always
reply
,
that
he
had
gone
out
about
*NL*
twenty
minutes
before
;
whereupon
Henrietta
presented
her
card
and
begged
*NL*
it
might
be
handed
him
on
his
return
.
She
left
the
inn
and
pursued
her
*NL*
course
along
the
quay
to
the
severe
portico
of
the
Uffizi
,
through
which
*NL*
she
presently
reached
the
entrance
of
the
famous
gallery
of
paintings
.
*NL*
Making
her
way
in
,
she
ascended
the
high
staircase
which
leads
to
the
*NL*
upper
chambers
.
The
long
corridor
,
glazed
on
one
side
and
decorated
with
*NL*
antique
busts
,
which
gives
admission
to
these
apartments
,
presented
an
*NL*
empty
vista
in
which
the
bright
winter
light
twinkled
upon
the
marble
*NL*
floor
.
The
gallery
is
very
cold
and
during
the
midwinter
weeks
but
*NL*
scantily
visited
.
Miss
Stackpole
may
appear
more
ardent
in
her
quest
of
*NL*
artistic
beauty
than
she
has
hitherto
struck
us
as
being
,
but
she
had
*NL*
after
all
her
preferences
and
admirations
.
One
of
the
latter
was
the
*NL*
little
Correggio
of
the
Tribune
--
the
Virgin
kneeling
down
before
the
*NL*
sacred
infant
,
who
lies
in
a
litter
of
straw
,
and
clapping
her
hands
*NL*
to
him
while
he
delightedly
laughs
and
crows
.
Henrietta
had
a
special
*NL*
devotion
to
this
intimate
scene
--
she
thought
it
the
most
beautiful
*NL*
picture
in
the
world
.
On
her
way
,
at
present
,
from
New
York
to
Rome
,
she
*NL*
was
spending
but
three
days
in
Florence
,
and
yet
reminded
herself
that
*NL*
they
must
not
elapse
without
her
paying
another
visit
to
her
favourite
*NL*
work
of
art
.
She
had
a
great
sense
of
beauty
in
all
ways
,
and
it
*NL*
involved
a
good
many
intellectual
obligations
.
She
was
about
to
turn
*NL*
into
the
Tribune
when
a
gentleman
came
out
of
it
;
whereupon
she
gave
a
*NL*
little
exclamation
and
stood
before
Caspar
Goodwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
just
been
at
your
hotel
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
left
a
card
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
much
honoured
,
''
Caspar
Goodwood
answered
as
if
he
really
meant
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
to
honour
you
I
did
it
;
I
've
called
on
you
before
and
I
know
*NL*
you
do
n't
like
it
.
It
was
to
talk
to
you
a
little
about
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
buckle
in
her
hat
.
``
I
shall
be
very
glad
*NL*
to
hear
what
you
wish
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
like
to
talk
with
me
,
''
said
Henrietta
.
``
But
I
do
n't
care
for
*NL*
that
;
I
do
n't
talk
for
your
amusement
.
I
wrote
a
word
to
ask
you
to
come
*NL*
and
see
me
;
but
since
I
've
met
you
here
this
will
do
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
going
away
,
''
Goodwood
stated
;
``
but
of
course
I
'll
stop
.
''
He
*NL*
was
civil
,
but
not
enthusiastic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
,
however
,
never
looked
for
great
professions
,
and
she
was
*NL*
so
much
in
earnest
that
she
was
thankful
he
would
listen
to
her
on
*NL*
any
terms
.
She
asked
him
first
,
none
the
less
,
if
he
had
seen
all
the
*NL*
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
want
to
.
I
've
been
here
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
you
've
seen
my
Correggio
,
''
said
Henrietta
.
``
I
came
up
on
*NL*
purpose
to
have
a
look
at
it
.
''
She
went
into
the
Tribune
and
he
slowly
*NL*
accompanied
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
've
seen
it
,
but
I
did
n't
know
it
was
yours
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
remember
pictures
--
especially
that
sort
.
''
She
had
pointed
out
her
*NL*
favourite
work
,
and
he
asked
her
if
it
was
about
Correggio
she
wished
to
*NL*
talk
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Henrietta
,
``
it
's
about
something
less
harmonious
!
''
They
*NL*
had
the
small
,
brilliant
room
,
a
splendid
cabinet
of
treasures
,
to
*NL*
themselves
;
there
was
only
a
custode
hovering
about
the
Medicean
Venus
.
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
,
''
Miss
Stackpole
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
frowned
a
little
,
but
he
expressed
no
embarrassment
at
*NL*
the
sense
of
not
looking
eager
.
His
face
was
that
of
a
much
older
man
*NL*
than
our
earlier
friend
.
``
I
'm
sure
it
's
something
I
sha
n't
like
,
''
he
*NL*
said
rather
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
think
you
'll
like
it
.
If
you
did
it
would
be
no
favour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
's
hear
it
,
''
he
went
on
in
the
tone
of
a
man
quite
conscious
*NL*
of
his
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
say
there
's
no
particular
reason
why
you
should
do
me
a
favour
.
*NL*
Indeed
I
only
know
of
one
:
the
fact
that
if
you
'd
let
me
I
'd
gladly
do
*NL*
you
one
.
''
Her
soft
,
exact
tone
,
in
which
there
was
no
attempt
at
effect
,
*NL*
had
an
extreme
sincerity
;
and
her
companion
,
though
he
presented
rather
*NL*
a
hard
surface
,
could
n't
help
being
touched
by
it
.
When
he
was
touched
*NL*
he
rarely
showed
it
,
however
,
by
the
usual
signs
;
he
neither
blushed
,
*NL*
nor
looked
away
,
nor
looked
conscious
.
He
only
fixed
his
attention
more
*NL*
directly
;
he
seemed
to
consider
with
added
firmness
.
Henrietta
continued
*NL*
therefore
disinterestedly
,
without
the
sense
of
an
advantage
.
``
I
may
say
*NL*
now
,
indeed
--
it
seems
a
good
time
--
that
if
I
've
ever
annoyed
you
-LRB-
and
*NL*
I
think
sometimes
I
have
-RRB-
it
's
because
I
knew
I
was
willing
to
suffer
*NL*
annoyance
for
you
.
I
've
troubled
you
--
doubtless
.
But
I
'd
TAKE
trouble
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Goodwood
hesitated
.
``
You
're
taking
trouble
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
--
some
.
I
want
you
to
consider
whether
it
's
better
on
the
*NL*
whole
that
you
should
go
to
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that
!
''
he
answered
rather
artlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
HAVE
considered
it
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
have
,
very
carefully
.
I
've
looked
all
round
it
.
Otherwise
*NL*
I
should
n't
have
come
so
far
as
this
.
That
's
what
I
stayed
in
Paris
two
*NL*
months
for
.
I
was
thinking
it
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
you
decided
as
you
liked
.
You
decided
it
was
best
because
*NL*
you
were
so
much
attracted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Best
for
whom
,
do
you
mean
?
''
Goodwood
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
for
yourself
first
.
For
Mrs.
Osmond
next
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
wo
n't
do
HER
any
good
!
I
do
n't
flatter
myself
that
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
it
do
her
some
harm
?
--
that
's
the
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
what
it
will
matter
to
her
.
I
'm
nothing
to
Mrs.
Osmond
.
But
*NL*
if
you
want
to
know
,
I
do
want
to
see
her
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
that
's
why
you
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
.
Could
there
be
a
better
reason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
will
it
help
you
?
--
that
's
what
I
want
to
know
,
''
said
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
ca
n't
tell
you
.
It
's
just
what
I
was
thinking
about
*NL*
in
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
make
you
more
discontented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
`
more
'
so
?
''
Goodwood
asked
rather
sternly
.
``
How
do
you
*NL*
know
I
'm
discontented
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Henrietta
,
hesitating
a
little
,
``
you
seem
never
to
have
*NL*
cared
for
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
what
I
care
for
?
''
he
cried
with
a
big
blush
.
``
Just
now
*NL*
I
care
to
go
to
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
looked
at
him
in
silence
,
with
a
sad
yet
luminous
expression
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
observed
at
last
,
``
I
only
wanted
to
tell
you
what
I
think
;
*NL*
I
had
it
on
my
mind
.
Of
course
you
think
it
's
none
of
my
business
.
But
*NL*
nothing
is
any
one
's
business
,
on
that
principle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
kind
of
you
;
I
'm
greatly
obliged
to
you
for
your
interest
,
''
*NL*
said
Caspar
Goodwood
.
``
I
shall
go
to
Rome
and
I
sha
n't
hurt
Mrs.
*NL*
Osmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
hurt
her
,
perhaps
.
But
will
you
help
her
?
--
that
's
the
real
*NL*
issue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
in
need
of
help
?
''
he
asked
slowly
,
with
a
penetrating
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
women
always
are
,
''
said
Henrietta
,
with
conscientious
evasiveness
*NL*
and
generalising
less
hopefully
than
usual
.
``
If
you
go
to
Rome
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
``
I
hope
you
'll
be
a
true
friend
--
not
a
selfish
one
!
''
And
she
*NL*
turned
off
and
began
to
look
at
the
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
let
her
go
and
stood
watching
her
while
she
wandered
*NL*
round
the
room
;
but
after
a
moment
he
rejoined
her
.
``
You
've
heard
*NL*
something
about
her
here
,
''
he
then
resumed
.
``
I
should
like
to
know
what
*NL*
you
've
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
had
never
prevaricated
in
her
life
,
and
,
though
on
this
*NL*
occasion
there
might
have
been
a
fitness
in
doing
so
,
she
decided
,
after
*NL*
thinking
some
minutes
,
to
make
no
superficial
exception
.
``
Yes
,
I
've
*NL*
heard
,
''
she
answered
;
``
but
as
I
do
n't
want
you
to
go
to
Rome
I
wo
n't
*NL*
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
you
please
.
I
shall
see
for
myself
,
''
he
said
.
Then
*NL*
inconsistently
,
for
him
,
``
You
've
heard
she
's
unhappy
!
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
wo
n't
see
that
!
''
Henrietta
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
.
When
do
you
start
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
,
by
the
evening
train
.
And
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Goodwood
hung
back
;
he
had
no
desire
to
make
his
journey
to
Rome
in
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
's
company
.
His
indifference
to
this
advantage
was
not
of
the
*NL*
same
character
as
Gilbert
Osmond
's
,
but
it
had
at
this
moment
an
equal
*NL*
distinctness
.
It
was
rather
a
tribute
to
Miss
Stackpole
's
virtues
than
a
*NL*
reference
to
her
faults
.
He
thought
her
very
remarkable
,
very
brilliant
,
*NL*
and
he
had
,
in
theory
,
no
objection
to
the
class
to
which
she
belonged
.
*NL*
Lady
correspondents
appeared
to
him
a
part
of
the
natural
scheme
of
*NL*
things
in
a
progressive
country
,
and
though
he
never
read
their
letters
*NL*
he
supposed
that
they
ministered
somehow
to
social
prosperity
.
But
*NL*
it
was
this
very
eminence
of
their
position
that
made
him
wish
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
did
n't
take
so
much
for
granted
.
She
took
for
granted
that
he
*NL*
was
always
ready
for
some
allusion
to
Mrs.
Osmond
;
she
had
done
so
when
*NL*
they
met
in
Paris
,
six
weeks
after
his
arrival
in
Europe
,
and
she
had
*NL*
repeated
the
assumption
with
every
successive
opportunity
.
He
had
no
*NL*
wish
whatever
to
allude
to
Mrs.
Osmond
;
he
was
NOT
always
thinking
of
*NL*
her
;
he
was
perfectly
sure
of
that
.
He
was
the
most
reserved
,
the
least
*NL*
colloquial
of
men
,
and
this
enquiring
authoress
was
constantly
flashing
*NL*
her
lantern
into
the
quiet
darkness
of
his
soul
.
He
wished
she
did
n't
*NL*
care
so
much
;
he
even
wished
,
though
it
might
seem
rather
brutal
of
him
,
*NL*
that
she
would
leave
him
alone
.
In
spite
of
this
,
however
,
he
just
now
*NL*
made
other
reflections
--
which
show
how
widely
different
,
in
effect
,
his
*NL*
ill-humour
was
from
Gilbert
Osmond
's
.
He
desired
to
go
immediately
to
*NL*
Rome
;
he
would
have
liked
to
go
alone
,
in
the
night-train
.
He
hated
the
*NL*
European
railway-carriages
,
in
which
one
sat
for
hours
in
a
vise
,
knee
*NL*
to
knee
and
nose
to
nose
with
a
foreigner
to
whom
one
presently
found
*NL*
one
's
self
objecting
with
all
the
added
vehemence
of
one
's
wish
to
have
*NL*
the
window
open
;
and
if
they
were
worse
at
night
even
than
by
day
,
at
*NL*
least
at
night
one
could
sleep
and
dream
of
an
American
saloon-car
.
But
*NL*
he
could
n't
take
a
night-train
when
Miss
Stackpole
was
starting
in
the
*NL*
morning
;
it
struck
him
that
this
would
be
an
insult
to
an
unprotected
*NL*
woman
.
Nor
could
he
wait
until
after
she
had
gone
unless
he
should
wait
*NL*
longer
than
he
had
patience
for
.
It
would
n't
do
to
start
the
next
day
.
*NL*
She
worried
him
;
she
oppressed
him
;
the
idea
of
spending
the
day
in
*NL*
a
European
railway-carriage
with
her
offered
a
complication
of
*NL*
irritations
.
Still
,
she
was
a
lady
travelling
alone
;
it
was
his
duty
to
*NL*
put
himself
out
for
her
.
There
could
be
no
two
questions
about
that
;
*NL*
it
was
a
perfectly
clear
necessity
.
He
looked
extremely
grave
for
some
*NL*
moments
and
then
said
,
wholly
without
the
flourish
of
gallantry
but
in
a
*NL*
tone
of
extreme
distinctness
,
``
Of
course
if
you
're
going
to-morrow
I
'll
*NL*
go
too
,
as
I
may
be
of
assistance
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Goodwood
,
I
should
hope
so
!
''
Henrietta
returned
*NL*
imperturbably
.

CHAPTER
XLV
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
already
had
reason
to
say
that
Isabel
knew
her
husband
to
be
*NL*
displeased
by
the
continuance
of
Ralph
's
visit
to
Rome
.
That
knowledge
*NL*
was
very
present
to
her
as
she
went
to
her
cousin
's
hotel
the
day
*NL*
after
she
had
invited
Lord
Warburton
to
give
a
tangible
proof
of
his
*NL*
sincerity
;
and
at
this
moment
,
as
at
others
,
she
had
a
sufficient
*NL*
perception
of
the
sources
of
Osmond
's
opposition
.
He
wished
her
to
have
*NL*
no
freedom
of
mind
,
and
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
Ralph
was
an
apostle
*NL*
of
freedom
.
It
was
just
because
he
was
this
,
Isabel
said
to
herself
,
*NL*
that
it
was
a
refreshment
to
go
and
see
him
.
It
will
be
perceived
that
*NL*
she
partook
of
this
refreshment
in
spite
of
her
husband
's
aversion
to
*NL*
it
,
that
is
partook
of
it
,
as
she
flattered
herself
,
discreetly
.
She
had
*NL*
not
as
yet
undertaken
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
his
wishes
;
he
was
*NL*
her
appointed
and
inscribed
master
;
she
gazed
at
moments
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
incredulous
blankness
at
this
fact
.
It
weighed
upon
her
imagination
,
*NL*
however
;
constantly
present
to
her
mind
were
all
the
traditionary
*NL*
decencies
and
sanctities
of
marriage
.
The
idea
of
violating
them
filled
*NL*
her
with
shame
as
well
as
with
dread
,
for
on
giving
herself
away
she
had
*NL*
lost
sight
of
this
contingency
in
the
perfect
belief
that
her
husband
's
*NL*
intentions
were
as
generous
as
her
own
.
She
seemed
to
see
,
none
the
*NL*
less
,
the
rapid
approach
of
the
day
when
she
should
have
to
take
back
*NL*
something
she
had
solemnly
bestown
.
Such
a
ceremony
would
be
odious
and
*NL*
monstrous
;
she
tried
to
shut
her
eyes
to
it
meanwhile
.
Osmond
would
do
*NL*
nothing
to
help
it
by
beginning
first
;
he
would
put
that
burden
upon
her
*NL*
to
the
end
.
He
had
not
yet
formally
forbidden
her
to
call
upon
Ralph
;
*NL*
but
she
felt
sure
that
unless
Ralph
should
very
soon
depart
this
*NL*
prohibition
would
come
.
How
could
poor
Ralph
depart
?
The
weather
as
yet
*NL*
made
it
impossible
.
She
could
perfectly
understand
her
husband
's
wish
*NL*
for
the
event
;
she
did
n't
,
to
be
just
,
see
how
he
COULD
like
her
to
be
*NL*
with
her
cousin
.
Ralph
never
said
a
word
against
him
,
but
Osmond
's
*NL*
sore
,
mute
protest
was
none
the
less
founded
.
If
he
should
positively
*NL*
interpose
,
if
he
should
put
forth
his
authority
,
she
would
have
to
*NL*
decide
,
and
that
would
n't
be
easy
.
The
prospect
made
her
heart
beat
and
*NL*
her
cheeks
burn
,
as
I
say
,
in
advance
;
there
were
moments
when
,
in
her
*NL*
wish
to
avoid
an
open
rupture
,
she
found
herself
wishing
Ralph
would
*NL*
start
even
at
a
risk
.
And
it
was
of
no
use
that
,
when
catching
herself
*NL*
in
this
state
of
mind
,
she
called
herself
a
feeble
spirit
,
a
coward
.
*NL*
It
was
not
that
she
loved
Ralph
less
,
but
that
almost
anything
seemed
*NL*
preferable
to
repudiating
the
most
serious
act
--
the
single
sacred
*NL*
act
--
of
her
life
.
That
appeared
to
make
the
whole
future
hideous
.
*NL*
To
break
with
Osmond
once
would
be
to
break
for
ever
;
any
open
*NL*
acknowledgement
of
irreconcilable
needs
would
be
an
admission
that
*NL*
their
whole
attempt
had
proved
a
failure
.
For
them
there
could
be
*NL*
no
condonement
,
no
compromise
,
no
easy
forgetfulness
,
no
formal
*NL*
readjustment
.
They
had
attempted
only
one
thing
,
but
that
one
thing
was
*NL*
to
have
been
exquisite
.
Once
they
missed
it
nothing
else
would
do
;
there
*NL*
was
no
conceivable
substitute
for
that
success
.
For
the
moment
,
Isabel
*NL*
went
to
the
Hotel
de
Paris
as
often
as
she
thought
well
;
the
measure
*NL*
of
propriety
was
in
the
canon
of
taste
,
and
there
could
n't
have
been
*NL*
a
better
proof
that
morality
was
,
so
to
speak
,
a
matter
of
earnest
*NL*
appreciation
.
Isabel
's
application
of
that
measure
had
been
particularly
*NL*
free
to-day
,
for
in
addition
to
the
general
truth
that
she
could
n't
*NL*
leave
Ralph
to
die
alone
she
had
something
important
to
ask
of
him
.
This
*NL*
indeed
was
Gilbert
's
business
as
well
as
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
very
soon
to
what
she
wished
to
speak
of
.
``
I
want
you
to
answer
*NL*
me
a
question
.
It
's
about
Lord
Warburton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
guess
your
question
,
''
Ralph
answered
from
his
arm-chair
,
out
*NL*
of
which
his
thin
legs
protruded
at
greater
length
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
possibly
you
guess
it
.
Please
then
answer
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
say
I
can
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
intimate
with
him
,
''
she
said
;
``
you
've
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
observation
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
.
But
think
how
he
must
dissimulate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
he
dissimulate
?
That
's
not
his
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
must
remember
that
the
circumstances
are
peculiar
,
''
said
Ralph
*NL*
with
an
air
of
private
amusement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
a
certain
extent
--
yes
.
But
is
he
really
in
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
,
I
think
.
I
can
make
that
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Isabel
with
a
certain
dryness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
looked
at
her
as
if
his
mild
hilarity
had
been
touched
with
*NL*
mystification
.
``
You
say
that
as
if
you
were
disappointed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
got
up
,
slowly
smoothing
her
gloves
and
eyeing
them
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
``
It
's
after
all
no
business
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
philosophic
,
''
said
her
cousin
.
And
then
in
a
moment
:
``
May
I
*NL*
enquire
what
you
're
talking
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
stared
.
``
I
thought
you
knew
.
Lord
Warburton
tells
me
he
wants
,
*NL*
of
all
things
in
the
world
,
to
marry
Pansy
.
I
've
told
you
that
before
,
*NL*
without
eliciting
a
comment
from
you
.
You
might
risk
one
this
morning
,
I
*NL*
think
.
Is
it
your
belief
that
he
really
cares
for
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
for
Pansy
,
no
!
''
cried
Ralph
very
positively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
said
just
now
he
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
waited
a
moment
.
``
That
he
cared
for
you
,
Mrs.
Osmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
shook
her
head
gravely
.
``
That
's
nonsense
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
.
But
the
nonsense
is
Warburton
's
,
not
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
very
tiresome
.
''
She
spoke
,
as
she
flattered
herself
,
with
*NL*
much
subtlety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
tell
you
indeed
,
''
Ralph
went
on
,
``
that
to
me
he
has
denied
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
good
of
you
to
talk
about
it
together
!
Has
he
also
told
you
*NL*
that
he
's
in
love
with
Pansy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
spoken
very
well
of
her
--
very
properly
.
He
has
let
me
know
,
of
*NL*
course
,
that
he
thinks
she
would
do
very
well
at
Lockleigh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
really
think
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
Warburton
really
thinks
--
!
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
fell
to
smoothing
her
gloves
again
;
they
were
long
,
loose
gloves
*NL*
on
which
she
could
freely
expend
herself
.
Soon
,
however
,
she
looked
*NL*
up
,
and
then
,
``
Ah
,
Ralph
,
you
give
me
no
help
!
''
she
cried
abruptly
and
*NL*
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
alluded
to
the
need
for
help
,
and
the
*NL*
words
shook
her
cousin
with
their
violence
.
He
gave
a
long
murmur
of
*NL*
relief
,
of
pity
,
of
tenderness
;
it
seemed
to
him
that
at
last
the
gulf
*NL*
between
them
had
been
bridged
.
It
was
this
that
made
him
exclaim
in
a
*NL*
moment
:
``
How
unhappy
you
must
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
she
recovered
her
self-possession
,
and
the
*NL*
first
use
she
made
of
it
was
to
pretend
she
had
not
heard
him
.
``
When
I
*NL*
talk
of
your
helping
me
I
talk
great
nonsense
,
''
she
said
with
a
quick
*NL*
smile
.
``
The
idea
of
my
troubling
you
with
my
domestic
embarrassments
!
*NL*
The
matter
's
very
simple
;
Lord
Warburton
must
get
on
by
himself
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
undertake
to
see
him
through
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ought
to
succeed
easily
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
debated
.
``
Yes
--
but
he
has
not
always
succeeded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
.
You
know
,
however
,
how
that
always
surprised
me
.
Is
Miss
*NL*
Osmond
capable
of
giving
us
a
surprise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
come
from
him
,
rather
.
I
seem
to
see
that
after
all
he
'll
let
*NL*
the
matter
drop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
do
nothing
dishonourable
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
sure
of
that
.
Nothing
can
be
more
honourable
than
for
him
to
*NL*
leave
the
poor
child
alone
.
She
cares
for
another
person
,
and
it
's
cruel
*NL*
to
attempt
to
bribe
her
by
magnificent
offers
to
give
him
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cruel
to
the
other
person
perhaps
--
the
one
she
cares
for
.
But
Warburton
*NL*
is
n't
obliged
to
mind
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
cruel
to
her
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
She
would
be
very
unhappy
if
she
were
*NL*
to
allow
herself
to
be
persuaded
to
desert
poor
Mr.
Rosier
.
That
idea
*NL*
seems
to
amuse
you
;
of
course
you
're
not
in
love
with
him
.
He
has
the
*NL*
merit
--
for
Pansy
--
of
being
in
love
with
Pansy
.
She
can
see
at
a
glance
*NL*
that
Lord
Warburton
is
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'd
be
very
good
to
her
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
good
to
her
already
.
Fortunately
,
however
,
he
has
not
said
*NL*
a
word
to
disturb
her
.
He
could
come
and
bid
her
good-bye
to-morrow
with
*NL*
perfect
propriety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
would
your
husband
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
;
and
he
may
be
right
in
not
liking
it
.
Only
he
must
obtain
*NL*
satisfaction
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
commissioned
you
to
obtain
it
?
''
Ralph
ventured
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
natural
that
as
an
old
friend
of
Lord
Warburton
's
--
an
older
*NL*
friend
,
that
is
,
than
Gilbert
--
I
should
take
an
interest
in
his
*NL*
intentions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
an
interest
in
his
renouncing
them
,
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
hesitated
,
frowning
a
little
.
``
Let
me
understand
.
Are
you
*NL*
pleading
his
cause
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
least
.
I
'm
very
glad
he
should
n't
become
your
stepdaughter
's
*NL*
husband
.
It
makes
such
a
very
queer
relation
to
you
!
''
said
Ralph
,
*NL*
smiling
.
``
But
I
'm
rather
nervous
lest
your
husband
should
think
you
*NL*
have
n't
pushed
him
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
found
herself
able
to
smile
as
well
as
he
.
``
He
knows
me
well
*NL*
enough
not
to
have
expected
me
to
push
.
He
himself
has
no
intention
*NL*
of
pushing
,
I
presume
.
I
'm
not
afraid
I
shall
not
be
able
to
justify
*NL*
myself
!
''
she
said
lightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mask
had
dropped
for
an
instant
,
but
she
had
put
it
on
again
,
to
*NL*
Ralph
's
infinite
disappointment
.
He
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
natural
*NL*
face
and
he
wished
immensely
to
look
into
it
.
He
had
an
almost
savage
*NL*
desire
to
hear
her
complain
of
her
husband
--
hear
her
say
that
she
should
*NL*
be
held
accountable
for
Lord
Warburton
's
defection
.
Ralph
was
certain
*NL*
that
this
was
her
situation
;
he
knew
by
instinct
,
in
advance
,
the
form
*NL*
that
in
such
an
event
Osmond
's
displeasure
would
take
.
It
could
only
*NL*
take
the
meanest
and
cruellest
.
He
would
have
liked
to
warn
Isabel
of
*NL*
it
--
to
let
her
see
at
least
how
he
judged
for
her
and
how
he
knew
.
It
*NL*
little
mattered
that
Isabel
would
know
much
better
;
it
was
for
his
own
*NL*
satisfaction
more
than
for
hers
that
he
longed
to
show
her
he
was
not
*NL*
deceived
.
He
tried
and
tried
again
to
make
her
betray
Osmond
;
he
felt
*NL*
cold-blooded
,
cruel
,
dishonourable
almost
,
in
doing
so
.
But
it
scarcely
*NL*
mattered
,
for
he
only
failed
.
What
had
she
come
for
then
,
and
why
did
*NL*
she
seem
almost
to
offer
him
a
chance
to
violate
their
tacit
convention
?
*NL*
Why
did
she
ask
him
his
advice
if
she
gave
him
no
liberty
to
answer
her
?
*NL*
How
could
they
talk
of
her
domestic
embarrassments
,
as
it
pleased
her
*NL*
humorously
to
designate
them
,
if
the
principal
factor
was
not
to
be
*NL*
mentioned
?
These
contradictions
were
themselves
but
an
indication
of
her
*NL*
trouble
,
and
her
cry
for
help
,
just
before
,
was
the
only
thing
he
was
*NL*
bound
to
consider
.
``
You
'll
be
decidedly
at
variance
,
all
the
same
,
''
he
*NL*
said
in
a
moment
.
And
as
she
answered
nothing
,
looking
as
if
she
scarce
*NL*
understood
,
``
You
'll
find
yourselves
thinking
very
differently
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
easily
happen
,
among
the
most
united
couples
!
''
She
took
up
her
*NL*
parasol
;
he
saw
she
was
nervous
,
afraid
of
what
he
might
say
.
``
It
's
a
*NL*
matter
we
can
hardly
quarrel
about
,
however
,
''
she
added
;
``
for
almost
all
*NL*
the
interest
is
on
his
side
.
That
's
very
natural
.
Pansy
's
after
all
his
*NL*
daughter
--
not
mine
.
''
And
she
put
out
her
hand
to
wish
him
goodbye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
took
an
inward
resolution
that
she
should
n't
leave
him
without
*NL*
his
letting
her
know
that
he
knew
everything
:
it
seemed
too
great
an
*NL*
opportunity
to
lose
.
``
Do
you
know
what
his
interest
will
make
him
say
?
''
*NL*
he
asked
as
he
took
her
hand
.
She
shook
her
head
,
rather
dryly
--
not
*NL*
discouragingly
--
and
he
went
on
.
``
It
will
make
him
say
that
your
want
*NL*
of
zeal
is
owing
to
jealousy
.
''
He
stopped
a
moment
;
her
face
made
him
*NL*
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
jealousy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
jealousy
of
his
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
blushed
red
and
threw
back
her
head
.
``
You
're
not
kind
,
''
she
said
in
*NL*
a
voice
that
he
had
never
heard
on
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
frank
with
me
and
you
'll
see
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
made
no
reply
;
she
only
pulled
her
hand
out
of
his
own
,
which
he
*NL*
tried
still
to
hold
,
and
rapidly
withdrew
from
the
room
.
She
made
up
her
*NL*
mind
to
speak
to
Pansy
,
and
she
took
an
occasion
on
the
same
day
,
going
*NL*
to
the
girl
's
room
before
dinner
.
Pansy
was
already
dressed
;
she
was
*NL*
always
in
advance
of
the
time
:
it
seemed
to
illustrate
her
pretty
*NL*
patience
and
the
graceful
stillness
with
which
she
could
sit
and
wait
.
*NL*
At
present
she
was
seated
,
in
her
fresh
array
,
before
the
bed-room
*NL*
fire
;
she
had
blown
out
her
candles
on
the
completion
of
her
toilet
,
in
*NL*
accordance
with
the
economical
habits
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
*NL*
sand
which
she
was
now
more
careful
than
ever
to
observe
;
so
that
*NL*
the
room
was
lighted
only
by
a
couple
of
logs
.
The
rooms
in
Palazzo
*NL*
Roccanera
were
as
spacious
as
they
were
numerous
,
and
Pansy
's
virginal
*NL*
bower
was
an
immense
chamber
with
a
dark
,
heavily-timbered
ceiling
.
*NL*
Its
diminutive
mistress
,
in
the
midst
of
it
,
appeared
but
a
speck
of
*NL*
humanity
,
and
as
she
got
up
,
with
quick
deference
,
to
welcome
Isabel
,
*NL*
the
latter
was
more
than
ever
struck
with
her
shy
sincerity
.
Isabel
*NL*
had
a
difficult
task
--
the
only
thing
was
to
perform
it
as
simply
as
*NL*
possible
.
She
felt
bitter
and
angry
,
but
she
warned
herself
against
*NL*
betraying
this
heat
.
She
was
afraid
even
of
looking
too
grave
,
or
at
*NL*
least
too
stern
;
she
was
afraid
of
causing
alarm
.
But
Pansy
seemed
to
*NL*
have
guessed
she
had
come
more
or
less
as
a
confessor
;
for
after
she
*NL*
had
moved
the
chair
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
a
little
nearer
to
the
*NL*
fire
and
Isabel
had
taken
her
place
in
it
,
she
kneeled
down
on
a
*NL*
cushion
in
front
of
her
,
looking
up
and
resting
her
clasped
hands
on
her
*NL*
stepmother
's
knees
.
What
Isabel
wished
to
do
was
to
hear
from
her
own
*NL*
lips
that
her
mind
was
not
occupied
with
Lord
Warburton
;
but
if
she
*NL*
desired
the
assurance
she
felt
herself
by
no
means
at
liberty
to
provoke
*NL*
it
.
The
girl
's
father
would
have
qualified
this
as
rank
treachery
;
and
*NL*
indeed
Isabel
knew
that
if
Pansy
should
display
the
smallest
germ
of
*NL*
a
disposition
to
encourage
Lord
Warburton
her
own
duty
was
to
hold
her
*NL*
tongue
.
It
was
difficult
to
interrogate
without
appearing
to
suggest
;
*NL*
Pansy
's
supreme
simplicity
,
an
innocence
even
more
complete
than
Isabel
*NL*
had
yet
judged
it
,
gave
to
the
most
tentative
enquiry
something
of
the
*NL*
effect
of
an
admonition
.
As
she
knelt
there
in
the
vague
firelight
,
with
*NL*
her
pretty
dress
dimly
shining
,
her
hands
folded
half
in
appeal
and
half
*NL*
in
submission
,
her
soft
eyes
,
raised
and
fixed
,
full
of
the
seriousness
*NL*
of
the
situation
,
she
looked
to
Isabel
like
a
childish
martyr
decked
*NL*
out
for
sacrifice
and
scarcely
presuming
even
to
hope
to
avert
it
.
When
*NL*
Isabel
said
to
her
that
she
had
never
yet
spoken
to
her
of
what
might
*NL*
have
been
going
on
in
relation
to
her
getting
married
,
but
that
her
*NL*
silence
had
not
been
indifference
or
ignorance
,
had
only
been
the
desire
*NL*
to
leave
her
at
liberty
,
Pansy
bent
forward
,
raised
her
face
nearer
*NL*
and
nearer
,
and
with
a
little
murmur
which
evidently
expressed
a
deep
*NL*
longing
,
answered
that
she
had
greatly
wished
her
to
speak
and
that
she
*NL*
begged
her
to
advise
her
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
difficult
for
me
to
advise
you
,
''
Isabel
returned
.
``
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
how
I
can
undertake
that
.
That
's
for
your
father
;
you
must
get
his
*NL*
advice
and
,
above
all
,
you
must
act
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Pansy
dropped
her
eyes
;
for
a
moment
she
said
nothing
.
``
I
think
*NL*
I
should
like
your
advice
better
than
papa
's
,
''
she
presently
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
as
it
should
be
,
''
said
Isabel
coldly
.
``
I
love
you
very
much
,
*NL*
but
your
father
loves
you
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
because
you
love
me
--
it
's
because
you
're
a
lady
,
''
Pansy
*NL*
answered
with
the
air
of
saying
something
very
reasonable
.
``
A
lady
can
*NL*
advise
a
young
girl
better
than
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
advise
you
then
to
pay
the
greatest
respect
to
your
father
's
wishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
''
said
the
child
eagerly
,
``
I
must
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
speak
to
you
now
about
your
getting
married
it
's
not
for
your
*NL*
own
sake
,
it
's
for
mine
,
''
Isabel
went
on
.
``
If
I
try
to
learn
from
you
*NL*
what
you
expect
,
what
you
desire
,
it
's
only
that
I
may
act
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
stared
,
and
then
very
quickly
,
``
Will
you
do
everything
I
want
?
''
*NL*
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
I
say
yes
I
must
know
what
such
things
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
presently
told
her
that
the
only
thing
she
wanted
in
life
was
to
*NL*
marry
Mr.
Rosier
.
He
had
asked
her
and
she
had
told
him
she
would
do
so
*NL*
if
her
papa
would
allow
it
.
Now
her
papa
would
n't
allow
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
then
,
it
's
impossible
,
''
Isabel
pronounced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
impossible
,
''
said
Pansy
without
a
sigh
and
with
the
same
*NL*
extreme
attention
in
her
clear
little
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
think
of
something
else
then
,
''
Isabel
went
on
;
but
Pansy
,
*NL*
sighing
at
this
,
told
her
that
she
had
attempted
that
feat
without
the
*NL*
least
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
of
those
who
think
of
you
,
''
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
.
``
I
*NL*
know
Mr.
Rosier
thinks
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ought
not
to
,
''
said
Isabel
loftily
.
``
Your
father
has
expressly
*NL*
requested
he
should
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ca
n't
help
it
,
because
he
knows
I
think
of
HIM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
think
of
him
.
There
's
some
excuse
for
him
,
perhaps
;
but
*NL*
there
's
none
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
try
to
find
one
,
''
the
girl
exclaimed
as
if
she
were
*NL*
praying
to
the
Madonna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
attempt
it
,
''
said
the
Madonna
with
unusual
*NL*
frigidity
.
``
If
you
knew
some
one
else
was
thinking
of
you
,
would
you
*NL*
think
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
can
think
of
me
as
Mr.
Rosier
does
;
no
one
has
the
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
I
do
n't
admit
Mr.
Rosier
's
right
!
''
Isabel
hypocritically
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
only
gazed
at
her
,
evidently
much
puzzled
;
and
Isabel
,
taking
*NL*
advantage
of
it
,
began
to
represent
to
her
the
wretched
consequences
of
*NL*
disobeying
her
father
.
At
this
Pansy
stopped
her
with
the
assurance
that
*NL*
she
would
never
disobey
him
,
would
never
marry
without
his
consent
.
And
*NL*
she
announced
,
in
the
serenest
,
simplest
tone
,
that
,
though
she
might
*NL*
never
marry
Mr.
Rosier
,
she
would
never
cease
to
think
of
him
.
She
*NL*
appeared
to
have
accepted
the
idea
of
eternal
singleness
;
but
Isabel
of
*NL*
course
was
free
to
reflect
that
she
had
no
conception
of
its
meaning
.
*NL*
She
was
perfectly
sincere
;
she
was
prepared
to
give
up
her
lover
.
This
*NL*
might
seem
an
important
step
toward
taking
another
,
but
for
Pansy
,
*NL*
evidently
,
it
failed
to
lead
in
that
direction
.
She
felt
no
bitterness
*NL*
toward
her
father
;
there
was
no
bitterness
in
her
heart
;
there
was
only
*NL*
the
sweetness
of
fidelity
to
Edward
Rosier
,
and
a
strange
,
exquisite
*NL*
intimation
that
she
could
prove
it
better
by
remaining
single
than
even
*NL*
by
marrying
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
would
like
you
to
make
a
better
marriage
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rosier
's
fortune
is
not
at
all
large
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
better
--
if
that
would
be
good
enough
?
And
I
have
myself
*NL*
so
little
money
;
why
should
I
look
for
a
fortune
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
having
so
little
is
a
reason
for
looking
for
more
.
''
With
which
*NL*
Isabel
was
grateful
for
the
dimness
of
the
room
;
she
felt
as
if
her
face
*NL*
were
hideously
insincere
.
It
was
what
she
was
doing
for
Osmond
;
it
was
*NL*
what
one
had
to
do
for
Osmond
!
Pansy
's
solemn
eyes
,
fixed
on
her
own
,
*NL*
almost
embarrassed
her
;
she
was
ashamed
to
think
she
had
made
so
light
*NL*
of
the
girl
's
preference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
you
like
me
to
do
?
''
her
companion
softly
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
was
a
terrible
one
,
and
Isabel
took
refuge
in
timorous
*NL*
vagueness
.
``
To
remember
all
the
pleasure
it
's
in
your
power
to
give
your
*NL*
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
marry
some
one
else
,
you
mean
--
if
he
should
ask
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
Isabel
's
answer
caused
itself
to
be
waited
for
;
then
she
*NL*
heard
herself
utter
it
in
the
stillness
that
Pansy
's
attention
seemed
to
*NL*
make
.
``
Yes
--
to
marry
some
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
's
eyes
grew
more
penetrating
;
Isabel
believed
she
was
doubting
*NL*
her
sincerity
,
and
the
impression
took
force
from
her
slowly
getting
*NL*
up
from
her
cushion
.
She
stood
there
a
moment
with
her
small
hands
*NL*
unclasped
and
then
quavered
out
:
``
Well
,
I
hope
no
one
will
ask
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has
been
a
question
of
that
.
Some
one
else
would
have
been
ready
*NL*
to
ask
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
he
can
have
been
ready
,
''
said
Pansy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
appear
so
if
he
had
been
sure
he
'd
succeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
had
been
sure
?
Then
he
was
n't
ready
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
thought
this
rather
sharp
;
she
also
got
up
and
stood
a
moment
*NL*
looking
into
the
fire
.
``
Lord
Warburton
has
shown
you
great
attention
,
''
*NL*
she
resumed
;
``
of
course
you
know
it
's
of
him
I
speak
.
''
She
found
*NL*
herself
,
against
her
expectation
,
almost
placed
in
the
position
of
*NL*
justifying
herself
;
which
led
her
to
introduce
this
nobleman
more
*NL*
crudely
than
she
had
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
very
kind
to
me
,
and
I
like
him
very
much
.
But
if
you
mean
*NL*
that
he
'll
propose
for
me
I
think
you
're
mistaken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
am
.
But
your
father
would
like
it
extremely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
shook
her
head
with
a
little
wise
smile
.
``
Lord
Warburton
wo
n't
*NL*
propose
simply
to
please
papa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
would
like
you
to
encourage
him
,
''
Isabel
went
on
*NL*
mechanically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
encourage
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Your
father
must
tell
you
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
said
nothing
for
a
moment
;
she
only
continued
to
smile
as
if
*NL*
she
were
in
possession
of
a
bright
assurance
.
``
There
's
no
danger
--
no
*NL*
danger
!
''
she
declared
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
conviction
in
the
way
she
said
this
,
and
a
felicity
in
her
*NL*
believing
it
,
which
conduced
to
Isabel
's
awkwardness
.
She
felt
accused
*NL*
of
dishonesty
,
and
the
idea
was
disgusting
.
To
repair
her
self-respect
*NL*
she
was
on
the
point
of
saying
that
Lord
Warburton
had
let
her
know
that
*NL*
there
was
a
danger
.
But
she
did
n't
;
she
only
said
--
in
her
embarrassment
*NL*
rather
wide
of
the
mark
--
that
he
surely
had
been
most
kind
,
most
*NL*
friendly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
has
been
very
kind
,
''
Pansy
answered
.
``
That
's
what
I
like
him
*NL*
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
then
is
the
difficulty
so
great
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
always
felt
sure
of
his
knowing
that
I
do
n't
want
--
what
did
you
*NL*
say
I
should
do
?
--
to
encourage
him
.
He
knows
I
do
n't
want
to
marry
,
*NL*
and
he
wants
me
to
know
that
he
therefore
wo
n't
trouble
me
.
That
's
the
*NL*
meaning
of
his
kindness
.
It
's
as
if
he
said
to
me
:
'
I
like
you
very
*NL*
much
,
but
if
it
does
n't
please
you
I
'll
never
say
it
again
.
'
I
*NL*
think
that
's
very
kind
,
very
noble
,
''
Pansy
went
on
with
deepening
*NL*
positiveness
.
``
That
is
all
we
've
said
to
each
other
.
And
he
does
n't
care
*NL*
for
me
either
.
Ah
no
,
there
's
no
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
touched
with
wonder
at
the
depths
of
perception
of
which
*NL*
this
submissive
little
person
was
capable
;
she
felt
afraid
of
Pansy
's
*NL*
wisdom
--
began
almost
to
retreat
before
it
.
``
You
must
tell
your
father
*NL*
that
,
''
she
remarked
reservedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
'd
rather
not
,
''
Pansy
unreservedly
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
n't
to
let
him
have
false
hopes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
;
but
it
will
be
good
for
me
that
he
should
.
So
long
as
he
*NL*
believes
that
Lord
Warburton
intends
anything
of
the
kind
you
say
,
papa
*NL*
wo
n't
propose
any
one
else
.
And
that
will
be
an
advantage
for
me
,
''
said
*NL*
the
child
very
lucidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
brilliant
in
her
lucidity
,
and
it
made
her
companion
*NL*
draw
a
long
breath
.
It
relieved
this
friend
of
a
heavy
responsibility
.
*NL*
Pansy
had
a
sufficient
illumination
of
her
own
,
and
Isabel
felt
that
*NL*
she
herself
just
now
had
no
light
to
spare
from
her
small
stock
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
it
still
clung
to
her
that
she
must
be
loyal
to
Osmond
,
*NL*
that
she
was
on
her
honour
in
dealing
with
his
daughter
.
Under
the
*NL*
influence
of
this
sentiment
she
threw
out
another
suggestion
before
she
*NL*
retired
--
a
suggestion
with
which
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
should
have
*NL*
done
her
utmost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
takes
for
granted
at
least
that
you
would
like
to
marry
a
*NL*
nobleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
stood
in
the
open
doorway
;
she
had
drawn
back
the
curtain
for
*NL*
Isabel
to
pass
.
``
I
think
Mr.
Rosier
looks
like
one
!

she
remarked
very
*NL*
gravely

CHAPTER
XLVI
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
was
not
seen
in
Mrs.
Osmond
's
drawing-room
for
several
*NL*
days
,
and
Isabel
could
n't
fail
to
observe
that
her
husband
said
nothing
*NL*
to
her
about
having
received
a
letter
from
him
.
She
could
n't
fail
to
*NL*
observe
,
either
,
that
Osmond
was
in
a
state
of
expectancy
and
that
,
*NL*
though
it
was
not
agreeable
to
him
to
betray
it
,
he
thought
their
*NL*
distinguished
friend
kept
him
waiting
quite
too
long
.
At
the
end
of
four
*NL*
days
he
alluded
to
his
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
become
of
Warburton
?
What
does
he
mean
by
treating
one
like
a
*NL*
tradesman
with
a
bill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
about
him
,
''
Isabel
said
.
``
I
saw
him
last
Friday
at
the
*NL*
German
ball
.
He
told
me
then
that
he
meant
to
write
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
never
written
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
supposed
,
from
your
not
having
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
an
odd
fish
,
''
said
Osmond
comprehensively
.
And
on
Isabel
's
making
*NL*
no
rejoinder
he
went
on
to
enquire
whether
it
took
his
lordship
five
*NL*
days
to
indite
a
letter
.
``
Does
he
form
his
words
with
such
difficulty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
Isabel
was
reduced
to
replying
.
``
I
've
never
had
a
letter
*NL*
from
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
had
a
letter
?
I
had
an
idea
that
you
were
at
one
time
in
intimate
*NL*
correspondence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
that
this
had
not
been
the
case
,
and
let
the
conversation
*NL*
drop
.
On
the
morrow
,
however
,
coming
into
the
drawing-room
late
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
her
husband
took
it
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Lord
Warburton
told
you
of
his
intention
of
writing
what
did
you
*NL*
say
to
him
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
just
faltered
.
``
I
think
I
told
him
not
to
forget
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
believe
there
was
a
danger
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
say
,
he
's
an
odd
fish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apparently
he
has
forgotten
it
,
''
said
Osmond
.
``
Be
so
good
as
to
remind
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
like
me
to
write
to
him
?
''
she
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
objection
whatever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
expect
too
much
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
I
expect
a
great
deal
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
shall
disappoint
you
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
expectations
have
survived
a
good
deal
of
disappointment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
know
that
.
Think
how
I
must
have
disappointed
myself
!
*NL*
If
you
really
wish
hands
laid
on
Lord
Warburton
you
must
lay
them
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
couple
of
minutes
Osmond
answered
nothing
;
then
he
said
:
``
That
*NL*
wo
n't
be
easy
,
with
you
working
against
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
started
;
she
felt
herself
beginning
to
tremble
.
He
had
a
way
of
*NL*
looking
at
her
through
half-closed
eyelids
,
as
if
he
were
thinking
of
*NL*
her
but
scarcely
saw
her
,
which
seemed
to
her
to
have
a
wonderfully
*NL*
cruel
intention
.
It
appeared
to
recognise
her
as
a
disagreeable
*NL*
necessity
of
thought
,
but
to
ignore
her
for
the
time
as
a
presence
.
*NL*
That
effect
had
never
been
so
marked
as
now
.
``
I
think
you
accuse
me
of
*NL*
something
very
base
,
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
accuse
you
of
not
being
trustworthy
.
If
he
does
n't
after
all
come
*NL*
forward
it
will
be
because
you
've
kept
him
off
.
I
do
n't
know
that
it
's
*NL*
base
:
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
a
woman
always
thinks
she
may
do
.
I
've
no
*NL*
doubt
you
've
the
finest
ideas
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
I
would
do
what
I
could
,
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
gained
you
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
over
her
,
after
he
had
said
this
,
that
she
had
once
thought
him
*NL*
beautiful
.
``
How
much
you
must
want
to
make
sure
of
him
!
''
she
exclaimed
*NL*
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
she
perceived
the
full
reach
of
her
*NL*
words
,
of
which
she
had
not
been
conscious
in
uttering
them
.
They
made
*NL*
a
comparison
between
Osmond
and
herself
,
recalled
the
fact
that
she
had
*NL*
once
held
this
coveted
treasure
in
her
hand
and
felt
herself
rich
*NL*
enough
to
let
it
fall
.
A
momentary
exultation
took
possession
of
her
--
a
*NL*
horrible
delight
in
having
wounded
him
;
for
his
face
instantly
told
her
*NL*
that
none
of
the
force
of
her
exclamation
was
lost
.
He
expressed
nothing
*NL*
otherwise
,
however
;
he
only
said
quickly
:
``
Yes
,
I
want
it
immensely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
a
servant
came
in
to
usher
a
visitor
,
and
he
was
followed
*NL*
the
next
by
Lord
Warburton
,
who
received
a
visible
check
on
seeing
*NL*
Osmond
.
He
looked
rapidly
from
the
master
of
the
house
to
the
mistress
;
*NL*
a
movement
that
seemed
to
denote
a
reluctance
to
interrupt
or
even
a
*NL*
perception
of
ominous
conditions
.
Then
he
advanced
,
with
his
English
*NL*
address
,
in
which
a
vague
shyness
seemed
to
offer
itself
as
an
element
*NL*
of
good-breeding
;
in
which
the
only
defect
was
a
difficulty
in
achieving
*NL*
transitions
.
Osmond
was
embarrassed
;
he
found
nothing
to
say
;
but
Isabel
*NL*
remarked
,
promptly
enough
,
that
they
had
been
in
the
act
of
talking
*NL*
about
their
visitor
.
Upon
this
her
husband
added
that
they
had
n't
known
*NL*
what
was
become
of
him
--
they
had
been
afraid
he
had
gone
away
.
``
No
,
''
*NL*
he
explained
,
smiling
and
looking
at
Osmond
;
``
I
'm
only
on
the
point
of
*NL*
going
.
''
And
then
he
mentioned
that
he
found
himself
suddenly
recalled
*NL*
to
England
:
he
should
start
on
the
morrow
or
the
day
after
.
``
I
'm
awfully
*NL*
sorry
to
leave
poor
Touchett
!
''
he
ended
by
exclaiming
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
neither
of
his
companions
spoke
;
Osmond
only
leaned
back
*NL*
in
his
chair
,
listening
.
Isabel
did
n't
look
at
him
;
she
could
only
fancy
*NL*
how
he
looked
.
Her
eyes
were
on
their
visitor
's
face
,
where
they
were
*NL*
the
more
free
to
rest
that
those
of
his
lordship
carefully
avoided
them
.
*NL*
Yet
Isabel
was
sure
that
had
she
met
his
glance
she
would
have
found
it
*NL*
expressive
.
``
You
had
better
take
poor
Touchett
with
you
,
''
she
heard
her
*NL*
husband
say
,
lightly
enough
,
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
better
wait
for
warmer
weather
,
''
Lord
Warburton
answered
.
``
I
*NL*
should
n't
advise
him
to
travel
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
talking
as
if
he
might
not
soon
*NL*
see
them
again
--
unless
indeed
they
should
come
to
England
,
a
course
*NL*
he
strongly
recommended
.
Why
should
n't
they
come
to
England
in
the
*NL*
autumn
?
--
that
struck
him
as
a
very
happy
thought
.
It
would
give
him
such
*NL*
pleasure
to
do
what
he
could
for
them
--
to
have
them
come
and
spend
a
*NL*
month
with
him
.
Osmond
,
by
his
own
admission
,
had
been
to
England
but
*NL*
once
;
which
was
an
absurd
state
of
things
for
a
man
of
his
leisure
and
*NL*
intelligence
.
It
was
just
the
country
for
him
--
he
would
be
sure
to
get
*NL*
on
well
there
.
Then
Lord
Warburton
asked
Isabel
if
she
remembered
what
*NL*
a
good
time
she
had
had
there
and
if
she
did
n't
want
to
try
it
again
.
*NL*
Did
n't
she
want
to
see
Gardencourt
once
more
?
Gardencourt
was
really
*NL*
very
good
.
Touchett
did
n't
take
proper
care
of
it
,
but
it
was
the
sort
*NL*
of
place
you
could
hardly
spoil
by
letting
it
alone
.
Why
did
n't
they
*NL*
come
and
pay
Touchett
a
visit
?
He
surely
must
have
asked
them
.
Had
n't
*NL*
asked
them
?
What
an
ill-mannered
wretch
!
--
and
Lord
Warburton
promised
to
*NL*
give
the
master
of
Gardencourt
a
piece
of
his
mind
.
Of
course
it
was
a
*NL*
mere
accident
;
he
would
be
delighted
to
have
them
.
Spending
a
month
with
*NL*
Touchett
and
a
month
with
himself
,
and
seeing
all
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
people
they
must
know
there
,
they
really
would
n't
find
it
half
bad
.
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
added
that
it
would
amuse
Miss
Osmond
as
well
,
who
had
told
*NL*
him
that
she
had
never
been
to
England
and
whom
he
had
assured
it
was
a
*NL*
country
she
deserved
to
see
.
Of
course
she
did
n't
need
to
go
to
England
*NL*
to
be
admired
--
that
was
her
fate
everywhere
;
but
she
would
be
an
immense
*NL*
success
there
,
she
certainly
would
,
if
that
was
any
inducement
.
He
asked
*NL*
if
she
were
not
at
home
:
could
n't
he
say
good-bye
?
Not
that
he
liked
*NL*
good-byes
--
he
always
funked
them
.
When
he
left
England
the
other
day
he
*NL*
had
n't
said
good-bye
to
a
two-legged
creature
.
He
had
had
half
a
mind
*NL*
to
leave
Rome
without
troubling
Mrs.
Osmond
for
a
final
interview
.
What
*NL*
could
be
more
dreary
than
final
interviews
?
One
never
said
the
things
*NL*
one
wanted
--
one
remembered
them
all
an
hour
afterwards
.
On
the
other
*NL*
hand
one
usually
said
a
lot
of
things
one
should
n't
,
simply
from
a
sense
*NL*
that
one
had
to
say
something
.
Such
a
sense
was
upsetting
;
it
muddled
*NL*
one
's
wits
.
He
had
it
at
present
,
and
that
was
the
effect
it
produced
*NL*
on
him
.
If
Mrs.
Osmond
did
n't
think
he
spoke
as
he
ought
she
must
set
*NL*
it
down
to
agitation
;
it
was
no
light
thing
to
part
with
Mrs.
Osmond
.
*NL*
He
was
really
very
sorry
to
be
going
.
He
had
thought
of
writing
to
her
*NL*
instead
of
calling
--
but
he
would
write
to
her
at
any
rate
,
to
tell
her
a
*NL*
lot
of
things
that
would
be
sure
to
occur
to
him
as
soon
as
he
had
left
*NL*
the
house
.
They
must
think
seriously
about
coming
to
Lockleigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
there
was
anything
awkward
in
the
conditions
of
his
visit
or
in
the
*NL*
announcement
of
his
departure
it
failed
to
come
to
the
surface
.
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
talked
about
his
agitation
;
but
he
showed
it
in
no
other
*NL*
manner
,
and
Isabel
saw
that
since
he
had
determined
on
a
retreat
he
was
*NL*
capable
of
executing
it
gallantly
.
She
was
very
glad
for
him
;
she
liked
*NL*
him
quite
well
enough
to
wish
him
to
appear
to
carry
a
thing
off
.
He
*NL*
would
do
that
on
any
occasion
--
not
from
impudence
but
simply
from
the
*NL*
habit
of
success
;
and
Isabel
felt
it
out
of
her
husband
's
power
to
*NL*
frustrate
this
faculty
.
A
complex
operation
,
as
she
sat
there
,
went
on
*NL*
in
her
mind
.
On
one
side
she
listened
to
their
visitor
;
said
what
was
*NL*
proper
to
him
;
read
,
more
or
less
,
between
the
lines
of
what
he
said
*NL*
himself
;
and
wondered
how
he
would
have
spoken
if
he
had
found
her
*NL*
alone
.
On
the
other
she
had
a
perfect
consciousness
of
Osmond
's
emotion
.
*NL*
She
felt
almost
sorry
for
him
;
he
was
condemned
to
the
sharp
pain
of
*NL*
loss
without
the
relief
of
cursing
.
He
had
had
a
great
hope
,
and
now
,
as
*NL*
he
saw
it
vanish
into
smoke
,
he
was
obliged
to
sit
and
smile
and
twirl
*NL*
his
thumbs
.
Not
that
he
troubled
himself
to
smile
very
brightly
;
he
*NL*
treated
their
friend
on
the
whole
to
as
vacant
a
countenance
as
so
*NL*
clever
a
man
could
very
well
wear
.
It
was
indeed
a
part
of
Osmond
's
*NL*
cleverness
that
he
could
look
consummately
uncompromised
.
His
present
*NL*
appearance
,
however
,
was
not
a
confession
of
disappointment
;
it
was
*NL*
simply
a
part
of
Osmond
's
habitual
system
,
which
was
to
be
inexpressive
*NL*
exactly
in
proportion
as
he
was
really
intent
.
He
had
been
intent
on
*NL*
this
prize
from
the
first
;
but
he
had
never
allowed
his
eagerness
to
*NL*
irradiate
his
refined
face
.
He
had
treated
his
possible
son-in-law
as
he
*NL*
treated
every
one
--
with
an
air
of
being
interested
in
him
only
for
his
*NL*
own
advantage
,
not
for
any
profit
to
a
person
already
so
generally
,
so
*NL*
perfectly
provided
as
Gilbert
Osmond
.
He
would
give
no
sign
now
of
an
*NL*
inward
rage
which
was
the
result
of
a
vanished
prospect
of
gain
--
not
*NL*
the
faintest
nor
subtlest
.
Isabel
could
be
sure
of
that
,
if
it
was
any
*NL*
satisfaction
to
her
.
Strangely
,
very
strangely
,
it
was
a
satisfaction
;
*NL*
she
wished
Lord
Warburton
to
triumph
before
her
husband
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
she
wished
her
husband
to
be
very
superior
before
Lord
Warburton
.
*NL*
Osmond
,
in
his
way
,
was
admirable
;
he
had
,
like
their
visitor
,
the
*NL*
advantage
of
an
acquired
habit
.
It
was
not
that
of
succeeding
,
but
it
*NL*
was
something
almost
as
good
--
that
of
not
attempting
.
As
he
leaned
back
*NL*
in
his
place
,
listening
but
vaguely
to
the
other
's
friendly
offers
and
*NL*
suppressed
explanations
--
as
if
it
were
only
proper
to
assume
that
they
*NL*
were
addressed
essentially
to
his
wife
--
he
had
at
least
-LRB-
since
so
little
*NL*
else
was
left
him
-RRB-
the
comfort
of
thinking
how
well
he
personally
had
*NL*
kept
out
of
it
,
and
how
the
air
of
indifference
,
which
he
was
now
able
*NL*
to
wear
,
had
the
added
beauty
of
consistency
.
It
was
something
to
be
*NL*
able
to
look
as
if
the
leave-taker
's
movements
had
no
relation
to
his
*NL*
own
mind
.
The
latter
did
well
,
certainly
;
but
Osmond
's
performance
was
*NL*
in
its
very
nature
more
finished
.
Lord
Warburton
's
position
was
after
*NL*
all
an
easy
one
;
there
was
no
reason
in
the
world
why
he
should
n't
leave
*NL*
Rome
.
He
had
had
beneficent
inclinations
,
but
they
had
stopped
short
*NL*
of
fruition
;
he
had
never
committed
himself
,
and
his
honour
was
safe
.
*NL*
Osmond
appeared
to
take
but
a
moderate
interest
in
the
proposal
that
*NL*
they
should
go
and
stay
with
him
and
in
his
allusion
to
the
success
*NL*
Pansy
might
extract
from
their
visit
.
He
murmured
a
recognition
,
but
*NL*
left
Isabel
to
say
that
it
was
a
matter
requiring
grave
consideration
.
*NL*
Isabel
,
even
while
she
made
this
remark
,
could
see
the
great
vista
*NL*
which
had
suddenly
opened
out
in
her
husband
's
mind
,
with
Pansy
's
little
*NL*
figure
marching
up
the
middle
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
had
asked
leave
to
bid
good-bye
to
Pansy
,
but
neither
*NL*
Isabel
nor
Osmond
had
made
any
motion
to
send
for
her
.
He
had
the
air
of
*NL*
giving
out
that
his
visit
must
be
short
;
he
sat
on
a
small
chair
,
as
if
*NL*
it
were
only
for
a
moment
,
keeping
his
hat
in
his
hand
.
But
he
stayed
*NL*
and
stayed
;
Isabel
wondered
what
he
was
waiting
for
.
She
believed
it
*NL*
was
not
to
see
Pansy
;
she
had
an
impression
that
on
the
whole
he
would
*NL*
rather
not
see
Pansy
.
It
was
of
course
to
see
herself
alone
--
he
had
*NL*
something
to
say
to
her
.
Isabel
had
no
great
wish
to
hear
it
,
for
she
*NL*
was
afraid
it
would
be
an
explanation
,
and
she
could
perfectly
dispense
*NL*
with
explanations
.
Osmond
,
however
,
presently
got
up
,
like
a
man
of
good
*NL*
taste
to
whom
it
had
occurred
that
so
inveterate
a
visitor
might
wish
*NL*
to
say
just
the
last
word
of
all
to
the
ladies
.
``
I
've
a
letter
to
write
*NL*
before
dinner
,
''
he
said
;
``
you
must
excuse
me
.
I
'll
see
if
my
daughter
's
*NL*
disengaged
,
and
if
she
is
she
shall
know
you
're
here
.
Of
course
when
*NL*
you
come
to
Rome
you
'll
always
look
us
up
.
Mrs.
Osmond
will
talk
to
you
*NL*
about
the
English
expedition
:
she
decides
all
those
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nod
with
which
,
instead
of
a
hand-shake
,
he
wound
up
this
little
*NL*
speech
was
perhaps
rather
a
meagre
form
of
salutation
;
but
on
the
whole
*NL*
it
was
all
the
occasion
demanded
.
Isabel
reflected
that
after
he
*NL*
left
the
room
Lord
Warburton
would
have
no
pretext
for
saying
,
``
Your
*NL*
husband
's
very
angry
''
;
which
would
have
been
extremely
disagreeable
to
*NL*
her
.
Nevertheless
,
if
he
had
done
so
,
she
would
have
said
:
``
Oh
,
do
n't
be
*NL*
anxious
.
He
does
n't
hate
you
:
it
's
me
that
he
hates
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
when
they
had
been
left
alone
together
that
her
friend
*NL*
showed
a
certain
vague
awkwardness
--
sitting
down
in
another
chair
,
*NL*
handling
two
or
three
of
the
objects
that
were
near
him
.
``
I
hope
he
'll
*NL*
make
Miss
Osmond
come
,
''
he
presently
remarked
.
``
I
want
very
much
to
see
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
it
's
the
last
time
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I
.
She
does
n't
care
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
does
n't
care
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
,
''
he
returned
.
Then
he
added
with
inconsequence
:
*NL*
``
You
'll
come
to
England
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
we
had
better
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
owe
me
a
visit
.
Do
n't
you
remember
that
you
were
to
have
come
*NL*
to
Lockleigh
once
,
and
you
never
did
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
's
changed
since
then
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
changed
for
the
worse
,
surely
--
as
far
as
we
're
concerned
.
To
see
*NL*
you
under
my
roof
''
--
and
he
hung
fire
but
an
instant
--
``
would
be
a
great
*NL*
satisfaction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
feared
an
explanation
;
but
that
was
the
only
one
that
occurred
.
*NL*
They
talked
a
little
of
Ralph
,
and
in
another
moment
Pansy
came
in
,
*NL*
already
dressed
for
dinner
and
with
a
little
red
spot
in
either
cheek
.
*NL*
She
shook
hands
with
Lord
Warburton
and
stood
looking
up
into
his
*NL*
face
with
a
fixed
smile
--
a
smile
that
Isabel
knew
,
though
his
lordship
*NL*
probably
never
suspected
it
,
to
be
near
akin
to
a
burst
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
away
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
want
to
bid
you
good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Lord
Warburton
.
''
Her
voice
perceptibly
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
want
to
tell
you
how
much
I
wish
you
may
be
very
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Lord
Warburton
,
''
Pansy
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lingered
a
moment
and
gave
a
glance
at
Isabel
.
``
You
ought
to
be
very
*NL*
happy
--
you
've
got
a
guardian
angel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
shall
be
happy
,
''
said
Pansy
in
the
tone
of
a
person
whose
*NL*
certainties
were
always
cheerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
conviction
as
that
will
take
you
a
great
way
.
But
if
it
should
*NL*
ever
fail
you
,
remember
--
remember
--
''
And
her
interlocutor
stammered
a
*NL*
little
.
``
Think
of
me
sometimes
,
you
know
!
''
he
said
with
a
vague
laugh
.
*NL*
Then
he
shook
hands
with
Isabel
in
silence
,
and
presently
he
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
left
the
room
she
expected
an
effusion
of
tears
from
her
*NL*
stepdaughter
;
but
Pansy
in
fact
treated
her
to
something
very
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
ARE
my
guardian
angel
!
''
she
exclaimed
very
sweetly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
shook
her
head
.
``
I
'm
not
an
angel
of
any
kind
.
I
'm
at
the
most
*NL*
your
good
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
very
good
friend
then
--
to
have
asked
papa
to
be
gentle
with
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
asked
your
father
nothing
,
''
said
Isabel
,
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
told
me
just
now
to
come
to
the
drawing-room
,
and
then
he
gave
me
a
*NL*
very
kind
kiss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
that
was
quite
his
own
idea
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
recognised
the
idea
perfectly
;
it
was
very
characteristic
,
and
she
*NL*
was
to
see
a
great
deal
more
of
it
.
Even
with
Pansy
he
could
n't
put
*NL*
himself
the
least
in
the
wrong
.
They
were
dining
out
that
day
,
and
after
*NL*
their
dinner
they
went
to
another
entertainment
;
so
that
it
was
not
till
*NL*
late
in
the
evening
that
Isabel
saw
him
alone
.
When
Pansy
kissed
him
*NL*
before
going
to
bed
he
returned
her
embrace
with
even
more
than
his
*NL*
usual
munificence
,
and
Isabel
wondered
if
he
meant
it
as
a
hint
that
his
*NL*
daughter
had
been
injured
by
the
machinations
of
her
stepmother
.
It
was
*NL*
a
partial
expression
,
at
any
rate
,
of
what
he
continued
to
expect
of
his
*NL*
wife
.
She
was
about
to
follow
Pansy
,
but
he
remarked
that
he
wished
she
*NL*
would
remain
;
he
had
something
to
say
to
her
.
Then
he
walked
about
the
*NL*
drawing-room
a
little
,
while
she
stood
waiting
in
her
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
what
you
wish
to
do
,
''
he
said
in
a
moment
.
``
I
should
*NL*
like
to
know
--
so
that
I
may
know
how
to
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
I
wish
to
go
to
bed
.
I
'm
very
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
and
rest
;
I
shall
not
keep
you
long
.
Not
there
--
take
a
*NL*
comfortable
place
.
''
And
he
arranged
a
multitude
of
cushions
that
were
*NL*
scattered
in
picturesque
disorder
upon
a
vast
divan
.
This
was
not
,
*NL*
however
,
where
she
seated
herself
;
she
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
.
*NL*
The
fire
had
gone
out
;
the
lights
in
the
great
room
were
few
.
She
drew
*NL*
her
cloak
about
her
;
she
felt
mortally
cold
.
``
I
think
you
're
trying
to
*NL*
humiliate
me
,
''
Osmond
went
on
.
``
It
's
a
most
absurd
undertaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
what
you
mean
,
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
played
a
very
deep
game
;
you
've
managed
it
beautifully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
that
I
've
managed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
not
quite
settled
it
,
however
;
we
shall
see
him
again
.
''
And
he
*NL*
stopped
in
front
of
her
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
looking
down
at
*NL*
her
thoughtfully
,
in
his
usual
way
,
which
seemed
meant
to
let
her
know
*NL*
that
she
was
not
an
object
,
but
only
a
rather
disagreeable
incident
,
of
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
mean
that
Lord
Warburton
's
under
an
obligation
to
come
back
*NL*
you
're
wrong
,
''
Isabel
said
.
``
He
's
under
none
whatever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
complain
of
.
But
when
I
say
he
'll
come
back
I
do
n't
*NL*
mean
he
'll
come
from
a
sense
of
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
else
to
make
him
.
I
think
he
has
quite
exhausted
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
no
,
that
's
a
shallow
judgement
.
Rome
's
inexhaustible
.
''
And
Osmond
*NL*
began
to
walk
about
again
.
``
However
,
about
that
perhaps
there
's
no
*NL*
hurry
,
''
he
added
.
``
It
's
rather
a
good
idea
of
his
that
we
should
go
*NL*
to
England
.
If
it
were
not
for
the
fear
of
finding
your
cousin
there
I
*NL*
think
I
should
try
to
persuade
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
that
you
'll
not
find
my
cousin
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
be
sure
of
it
.
However
,
I
shall
be
as
sure
as
*NL*
possible
.
At
the
same
time
I
should
like
to
see
his
house
,
that
you
told
*NL*
me
so
much
about
at
one
time
:
what
do
you
call
it
?
--
Gardencourt
.
It
must
*NL*
be
a
charming
thing
.
And
then
,
you
know
,
I
've
a
devotion
to
the
memory
*NL*
of
your
uncle
:
you
made
me
take
a
great
fancy
to
him
.
I
should
like
to
*NL*
see
where
he
lived
and
died
.
That
indeed
is
a
detail
.
Your
friend
was
*NL*
right
.
Pansy
ought
to
see
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
doubt
she
would
enjoy
it
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
a
long
time
hence
;
next
autumn
's
far
off
,
''
Osmond
continued
;
*NL*
``
and
meantime
there
are
things
that
more
nearly
interest
us
.
Do
you
*NL*
think
me
so
very
proud
?
''
he
suddenly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
very
strange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
understand
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
even
when
you
insult
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
insult
you
;
I
'm
incapable
of
it
.
I
merely
speak
of
certain
*NL*
facts
,
and
if
the
allusion
's
an
injury
to
you
the
fault
's
not
mine
.
*NL*
It
's
surely
a
fact
that
you
have
kept
all
this
matter
quite
in
your
own
*NL*
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
back
to
Lord
Warburton
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
``
I
'm
very
tired
of
*NL*
his
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
hear
it
again
before
we
've
done
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
spoken
of
his
insulting
her
,
but
it
suddenly
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
this
ceased
to
be
a
pain
.
He
was
going
down
--
down
;
the
vision
of
such
a
*NL*
fall
made
her
almost
giddy
:
that
was
the
only
pain
.
He
was
too
strange
,
*NL*
too
different
;
he
did
n't
touch
her
.
Still
,
the
working
of
his
morbid
*NL*
passion
was
extraordinary
,
and
she
felt
a
rising
curiosity
to
know
in
*NL*
what
light
he
saw
himself
justified
.
``
I
might
say
to
you
that
I
judge
*NL*
you
've
nothing
to
say
to
me
that
's
worth
hearing
,
''
she
returned
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
``
But
I
should
perhaps
be
wrong
.
There
's
a
thing
that
would
be
*NL*
worth
my
hearing
--
to
know
in
the
plainest
words
of
what
it
is
you
accuse
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
having
prevented
Pansy
's
marriage
to
Warburton
.
Are
those
words
*NL*
plain
enough
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
took
a
great
interest
in
it
.
I
told
you
so
;
and
when
*NL*
you
told
me
that
you
counted
on
me
--
that
I
think
was
what
you
said
--
I
*NL*
accepted
the
obligation
.
I
was
a
fool
to
do
so
,
but
I
did
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
pretended
to
do
it
,
and
you
even
pretended
reluctance
to
make
me
*NL*
more
willing
to
trust
you
.
Then
you
began
to
use
your
ingenuity
to
get
*NL*
him
out
of
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
see
what
you
mean
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
letter
you
told
me
he
had
written
me
?
''
her
husband
*NL*
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
;
I
have
n't
asked
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
stopped
it
on
the
way
,
''
said
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
slowly
got
up
;
standing
there
in
her
white
cloak
,
which
covered
*NL*
her
to
her
feet
,
she
might
have
represented
the
angel
of
disdain
,
first
*NL*
cousin
to
that
of
pity
.
``
Oh
,
Gilbert
,
for
a
man
who
was
so
fine
--
!
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
in
a
long
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
never
so
fine
as
you
.
You
've
done
everything
you
wanted
.
You
've
*NL*
got
him
out
of
the
way
without
appearing
to
do
so
,
and
you
've
placed
*NL*
me
in
the
position
in
which
you
wished
to
see
me
--
that
of
a
man
who
has
*NL*
tried
to
marry
his
daughter
to
a
lord
,
but
has
grotesquely
failed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pansy
does
n't
care
for
him
.
She
's
very
glad
he
's
gone

Isabel
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
does
n't
care
for
Pansy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
wo
n't
do
;
you
told
me
he
did
.
I
do
n't
know
why
you
wanted
this
*NL*
particular
satisfaction
,
''
Osmond
continued
;
``
you
might
have
taken
some
*NL*
other
.
It
does
n't
seem
to
me
that
I
've
been
presumptuous
--
that
I
have
*NL*
taken
too
much
for
granted
.
I
've
been
very
modest
about
it
,
very
quiet
.
*NL*
The
idea
did
n't
originate
with
me
.
He
began
to
show
that
he
liked
her
*NL*
before
I
ever
thought
of
it
.
I
left
it
all
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
were
very
glad
to
leave
it
to
me
.
After
this
you
must
attend
*NL*
to
such
things
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
a
moment
;
then
he
turned
away
.
``
I
thought
you
were
very
*NL*
fond
of
my
daughter

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
been
more
so
than
to-day

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
affection
is
attended
with
immense
limitations

However

that
*NL*
perhaps
is
natural
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
all
you
wished
to
say
to
me
?

Isabel
asked
,
taking
a
candle
*NL*
that
stood
on
one
of
the
tables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
satisfied
?
Am
I
sufficiently
disappointed
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
that
on
the
whole
you
're
disappointed

You
've
had
another

opportunity
to
try
to
stupefy
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
that
.
It
's
proved
that

can
aim
high

she
turned
away
with

CHAPTER
XLVII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
from
Henrietta
Stackpole
that
she
learned
how
Caspar
Goodwood
had
*NL*
come
to
Rome
;
an
event
that
took
place
three
days
after
Lord
Warburton
's
*NL*
departure
.
This
latter
fact
had
been
preceded
by
an
incident
of
some
*NL*
importance
to
Isabel
--
the
temporary
absence
,
once
again
,
of
Madame
*NL*
Merle
,
who
had
gone
to
Naples
to
stay
with
a
friend
,
the
happy
possessor
*NL*
of
a
villa
at
Posilippo
.
Madame
Merle
had
ceased
to
minister
to
Isabel
's
*NL*
happiness
,
who
found
herself
wondering
whether
the
most
discreet
of
*NL*
women
might
not
also
by
chance
be
the
most
dangerous
.
Sometimes
,
at
*NL*
night
,
she
had
strange
visions
;
she
seemed
to
see
her
husband
and
her
*NL*
friend
--
his
friend
--
in
dim
,
indistinguishable
combination
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
her
that
she
had
not
done
with
her
;
this
lady
had
something
in
reserve
.
*NL*
Isabel
's
imagination
applied
itself
actively
to
this
elusive
point
,
but
*NL*
every
now
and
then
it
was
checked
by
a
nameless
dread
,
so
that
when
*NL*
the
charming
woman
was
away
from
Rome
she
had
almost
a
consciousness
*NL*
of
respite
.
She
had
already
learned
from
Miss
Stackpole
that
Caspar
*NL*
Goodwood
was
in
Europe
,
Henrietta
having
written
to
make
it
known
to
*NL*
her
immediately
after
meeting
him
in
Paris
.
He
himself
never
wrote
to
*NL*
Isabel
,
and
though
he
was
in
Europe
she
thought
it
very
possible
he
*NL*
might
not
desire
to
see
her
.
Their
last
interview
,
before
her
marriage
,
*NL*
had
had
quite
the
character
of
a
complete
rupture
;
if
she
remembered
*NL*
rightly
he
had
said
he
wished
to
take
his
last
look
at
her
.
Since
then
*NL*
he
had
been
the
most
discordant
survival
of
her
earlier
time
--
the
only
*NL*
one
in
fact
with
which
a
permanent
pain
was
associated
.
He
had
left
her
*NL*
that
morning
with
a
sense
of
the
most
superfluous
of
shocks
:
it
was
like
*NL*
a
collision
between
vessels
in
broad
daylight
.
There
had
been
no
mist
,
*NL*
no
hidden
current
to
excuse
it
,
and
she
herself
had
only
wished
to
steer
*NL*
wide
.
He
had
bumped
against
her
prow
,
however
,
while
her
hand
was
on
the
*NL*
tiller
,
and
--
to
complete
the
metaphor
--
had
given
the
lighter
vessel
a
*NL*
strain
which
still
occasionally
betrayed
itself
in
a
faint
creaking
.
It
*NL*
had
been
horrid
to
see
him
,
because
he
represented
the
only
serious
harm
*NL*
that
-LRB-
to
her
belief
-RRB-
she
had
ever
done
in
the
world
:
he
was
the
only
*NL*
person
with
an
unsatisfied
claim
on
her
.
She
had
made
him
unhappy
,
she
*NL*
could
n't
help
it
;
and
his
unhappiness
was
a
grim
reality
.
She
had
cried
*NL*
with
rage
,
after
he
had
left
her
,
at
--
she
hardly
knew
what
:
she
tried
to
*NL*
think
it
had
been
at
his
want
of
consideration
.
He
had
come
to
her
with
*NL*
his
unhappiness
when
her
own
bliss
was
so
perfect
;
he
had
done
his
best
*NL*
to
darken
the
brightness
of
those
pure
rays
.
He
had
not
been
violent
,
*NL*
and
yet
there
had
been
a
violence
in
the
impression
.
There
had
been
a
*NL*
violence
at
any
rate
in
something
somewhere
;
perhaps
it
was
only
in
her
*NL*
own
fit
of
weeping
and
in
that
after-sense
of
the
same
which
had
lasted
*NL*
three
or
four
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
his
final
appeal
had
in
short
faded
away
,
and
all
the
*NL*
first
year
of
her
marriage
he
had
dropped
out
of
her
books
.
He
was
a
*NL*
thankless
subject
of
reference
;
it
was
disagreeable
to
have
to
think
*NL*
of
a
person
who
was
sore
and
sombre
about
you
and
whom
you
could
yet
do
*NL*
nothing
to
relieve
.
It
would
have
been
different
if
she
had
been
able
to
*NL*
doubt
,
even
a
little
,
of
his
unreconciled
state
,
as
she
doubted
of
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
's
;
unfortunately
it
was
beyond
question
,
and
this
aggressive
,
*NL*
uncompromising
look
of
it
was
just
what
made
it
unattractive
.
She
could
*NL*
never
say
to
herself
that
here
was
a
sufferer
who
had
compensations
,
as
*NL*
she
was
able
to
say
in
the
case
of
her
English
suitor
.
She
had
no
faith
*NL*
in
Mr.
Goodwood
's
compensations
and
no
esteem
for
them
.
A
cotton
factory
*NL*
was
not
a
compensation
for
anything
--
least
of
all
for
having
failed
*NL*
to
marry
Isabel
Archer
.
And
yet
,
beyond
that
,
she
hardly
knew
what
*NL*
he
had
--
save
of
course
his
intrinsic
qualities
.
Oh
,
he
was
intrinsic
*NL*
enough
;
she
never
thought
of
his
even
looking
for
artificial
aids
.
If
*NL*
he
extended
his
business
--
that
,
to
the
best
of
her
belief
,
was
the
*NL*
only
form
exertion
could
take
with
him
--
it
would
be
because
it
was
an
*NL*
enterprising
thing
,
or
good
for
the
business
;
not
in
the
least
because
*NL*
he
might
hope
it
would
overlay
the
past
.
This
gave
his
figure
a
kind
of
*NL*
bareness
and
bleakness
which
made
the
accident
of
meeting
it
in
memory
*NL*
or
in
apprehension
a
peculiar
concussion
;
it
was
deficient
in
the
social
*NL*
drapery
commonly
muffling
,
in
an
overcivilized
age
,
the
sharpness
of
*NL*
human
contacts
.
His
perfect
silence
,
moreover
,
the
fact
that
she
never
*NL*
heard
from
him
and
very
seldom
heard
any
mention
of
him
,
deepened
this
*NL*
impression
of
his
loneliness
.
She
asked
Lily
for
news
of
him
,
from
*NL*
time
to
time
;
but
Lily
knew
nothing
of
Boston
--
her
imagination
was
*NL*
all
bounded
on
the
east
by
Madison
Avenue
.
As
time
went
on
Isabel
had
*NL*
thought
of
him
oftener
,
and
with
fewer
restrictions
;
she
had
had
more
*NL*
than
once
the
idea
of
writing
to
him
.
She
had
never
told
her
husband
*NL*
about
him
--
never
let
Osmond
know
of
his
visits
to
her
in
Florence
;
a
*NL*
reserve
not
dictated
in
the
early
period
by
a
want
of
confidence
*NL*
in
Osmond
,
but
simply
by
the
consideration
that
the
young
man
's
*NL*
disappointment
was
not
her
secret
but
his
own
.
It
would
be
wrong
of
her
,
*NL*
she
had
believed
,
to
convey
it
to
another
,
and
Mr.
Goodwood
's
affairs
*NL*
could
have
,
after
all
,
little
interest
for
Gilbert
.
When
it
had
come
*NL*
to
the
point
she
had
never
written
to
him
;
it
seemed
to
her
that
,
*NL*
considering
his
grievance
,
the
least
she
could
do
was
to
let
him
alone
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
she
would
have
been
glad
to
be
in
some
way
nearer
to
him
.
*NL*
It
was
not
that
it
ever
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
have
married
him
;
*NL*
even
after
the
consequences
of
her
actual
union
had
grown
vivid
to
her
*NL*
that
particular
reflection
,
though
she
indulged
in
so
many
,
had
not
had
*NL*
the
assurance
to
present
itself
.
But
on
finding
herself
in
trouble
he
*NL*
had
become
a
member
of
that
circle
of
things
with
which
she
wished
to
*NL*
set
herself
right
.
I
have
mentioned
how
passionately
she
needed
to
feel
*NL*
that
her
unhappiness
should
not
have
come
to
her
through
her
own
fault
.
*NL*
She
had
no
near
prospect
of
dying
,
and
yet
she
wished
to
make
her
peace
*NL*
with
the
world
--
to
put
her
spiritual
affairs
in
order
.
It
came
back
to
*NL*
her
from
time
to
time
that
there
was
an
account
still
to
be
settled
*NL*
with
Caspar
,
and
she
saw
herself
disposed
or
able
to
settle
it
to-day
*NL*
on
terms
easier
for
him
than
ever
before
.
Still
,
when
she
learned
he
was
*NL*
coming
to
Rome
she
felt
all
afraid
;
it
would
be
more
disagreeable
for
*NL*
him
than
for
any
one
else
to
make
out
--
since
he
WOULD
make
it
out
,
as
*NL*
over
a
falsified
balance-sheet
or
something
of
that
sort
--
the
intimate
*NL*
disarray
of
her
affairs
.
Deep
in
her
breast
she
believed
that
he
had
*NL*
invested
his
all
in
her
happiness
,
while
the
others
had
invested
only
*NL*
a
part
.
He
was
one
more
person
from
whom
she
should
have
to
conceal
her
*NL*
stress
.
She
was
reassured
,
however
,
after
he
arrived
in
Rome
,
for
he
*NL*
spent
several
days
without
coming
to
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
Stackpole
,
it
may
well
be
imagined
,
was
more
punctual
,
and
*NL*
Isabel
was
largely
favoured
with
the
society
of
her
friend
.
She
threw
*NL*
herself
into
it
,
for
now
that
she
had
made
such
a
point
of
keeping
*NL*
her
conscience
clear
,
that
was
one
way
of
proving
she
had
not
been
*NL*
superficial
--
the
more
so
as
the
years
,
in
their
flight
,
had
rather
*NL*
enriched
than
blighted
those
peculiarities
which
had
been
humorously
*NL*
criticised
by
persons
less
interested
than
Isabel
,
and
which
were
still
*NL*
marked
enough
to
give
loyalty
a
spice
of
heroism
.
Henrietta
was
as
*NL*
keen
and
quick
and
fresh
as
ever
,
and
as
neat
and
bright
and
fair
.
Her
*NL*
remarkably
open
eyes
,
lighted
like
great
glazed
railway-stations
,
had
*NL*
put
up
no
shutters
;
her
attire
had
lost
none
of
its
crispness
,
her
*NL*
opinions
none
of
their
national
reference
.
She
was
by
no
means
quite
*NL*
unchanged
,
however
it
struck
Isabel
she
had
grown
vague
.
Of
old
she
had
*NL*
never
been
vague
;
though
undertaking
many
enquiries
at
once
,
she
had
*NL*
managed
to
be
entire
and
pointed
about
each
.
She
had
a
reason
for
*NL*
everything
she
did
;
she
fairly
bristled
with
motives
.
Formerly
,
when
*NL*
she
came
to
Europe
it
was
because
she
wished
to
see
it
,
but
now
,
having
*NL*
already
seen
it
,
she
had
no
such
excuse
.
She
did
n't
for
a
moment
pretend
*NL*
that
the
desire
to
examine
decaying
civilisations
had
anything
to
do
*NL*
with
her
present
enterprise
;
her
journey
was
rather
an
expression
of
her
*NL*
independence
of
the
old
world
than
of
a
sense
of
further
obligations
to
*NL*
it
.
``
It
's
nothing
to
come
to
Europe
,
''
she
said
to
Isabel
;
``
it
does
n't
*NL*
seem
to
me
one
needs
so
many
reasons
for
that
.
It
is
something
to
stay
*NL*
at
home
;
this
is
much
more
important
.
''
It
was
not
therefore
with
a
sense
*NL*
of
doing
anything
very
important
that
she
treated
herself
to
another
*NL*
pilgrimage
to
Rome
;
she
had
seen
the
place
before
and
carefully
*NL*
inspected
it
;
her
present
act
was
simply
a
sign
of
familiarity
,
of
her
*NL*
knowing
all
about
it
,
of
her
having
as
good
a
right
as
any
one
else
to
*NL*
be
there
.
This
was
all
very
well
,
and
Henrietta
was
restless
;
she
had
a
*NL*
perfect
right
to
be
restless
too
,
if
one
came
to
that
.
But
she
had
after
*NL*
all
a
better
reason
for
coming
to
Rome
than
that
she
cared
for
it
so
*NL*
little
.
Her
friend
easily
recognised
it
,
and
with
it
the
worth
of
the
*NL*
other
's
fidelity
.
She
had
crossed
the
stormy
ocean
in
midwinter
because
*NL*
she
had
guessed
that
Isabel
was
sad
.
Henrietta
guessed
a
great
deal
,
but
*NL*
she
had
never
guessed
so
happily
as
that
.
Isabel
's
satisfactions
just
*NL*
now
were
few
,
but
even
if
they
had
been
more
numerous
there
would
still
*NL*
have
been
something
of
individual
joy
in
her
sense
of
being
justified
*NL*
in
having
always
thought
highly
of
Henrietta
.
She
had
made
large
*NL*
concessions
with
regard
to
her
,
and
had
yet
insisted
that
,
with
all
*NL*
abatements
,
she
was
very
valuable
.
It
was
not
her
own
triumph
,
however
,
*NL*
that
she
found
good
;
it
was
simply
the
relief
of
confessing
to
this
*NL*
confidant
,
the
first
person
to
whom
she
had
owned
it
,
that
she
was
not
*NL*
in
the
least
at
her
ease
.
Henrietta
had
herself
approached
this
point
*NL*
with
the
smallest
possible
delay
,
and
had
accused
her
to
her
face
of
*NL*
being
wretched
.
She
was
a
woman
,
she
was
a
sister
;
she
was
not
Ralph
,
*NL*
nor
Lord
Warburton
,
nor
Caspar
Goodwood
,
and
Isabel
could
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
wretched
,
''
she
said
very
mildly
.
She
hated
to
hear
herself
say
*NL*
it
;
she
tried
to
say
it
as
judicially
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
he
do
to
you
?
''
Henrietta
asked
,
frowning
as
if
she
were
*NL*
enquiring
into
the
operations
of
a
quack
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
nothing
.
But
he
does
n't
like
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
very
hard
to
please
!
''
cried
Miss
Stackpole
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
leave
*NL*
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
change
that
way
,
''
Isabel
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
You
wo
n't
confess
that
you
've
made
a
*NL*
mistake
.
You
're
too
proud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
'm
too
proud
.
But
I
ca
n't
publish
my
mistake
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
that
's
decent
.
I
'd
much
rather
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
think
so
always
,
''
said
Henrietta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
great
unhappiness
might
bring
me
to
;
but
it
seems
to
*NL*
me
I
shall
always
be
ashamed
.
One
must
accept
one
's
deeds
.
I
married
*NL*
him
before
all
the
world
;
I
was
perfectly
free
;
it
was
impossible
to
do
*NL*
anything
more
deliberate
.
One
ca
n't
change
that
way
,
''
Isabel
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
HAVE
changed
,
in
spite
of
the
impossibility
.
I
hope
you
do
n't
mean
*NL*
to
say
you
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
debated
.
``
No
,
I
do
n't
like
him
.
I
can
tell
you
,
because
I
'm
weary
*NL*
of
my
secret
.
But
that
's
enough
;
I
ca
n't
announce
it
on
the
housetops
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
gave
a
laugh
.
``
Do
n't
you
think
you
're
rather
too
considerate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
of
him
that
I
'm
considerate
--
it
's
of
myself
!
''
Isabel
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
surprising
Gilbert
Osmond
should
not
have
taken
comfort
in
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
;
his
instinct
had
naturally
set
him
in
opposition
to
a
*NL*
young
lady
capable
of
advising
his
wife
to
withdraw
from
the
conjugal
*NL*
roof
.
When
she
arrived
in
Rome
he
had
said
to
Isabel
that
he
hoped
she
*NL*
would
leave
her
friend
the
interviewer
alone
;
and
Isabel
had
answered
*NL*
that
he
at
least
had
nothing
to
fear
from
her
.
She
said
to
Henrietta
*NL*
that
as
Osmond
did
n't
like
her
she
could
n't
invite
her
to
dine
,
but
*NL*
they
could
easily
see
each
other
in
other
ways
.
Isabel
received
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
freely
in
her
own
sitting-room
,
and
took
her
repeatedly
to
*NL*
drive
,
face
to
face
with
Pansy
,
who
,
bending
a
little
forward
,
on
the
*NL*
opposite
seat
of
the
carriage
,
gazed
at
the
celebrated
authoress
with
a
*NL*
respectful
attention
which
Henrietta
occasionally
found
irritating
.
She
*NL*
complained
to
Isabel
that
Miss
Osmond
had
a
little
look
as
if
she
should
*NL*
remember
everything
one
said
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
be
remembered
that
way
,
''
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
declared
;
``
I
consider
that
my
conversation
refers
only
*NL*
to
the
moment
,
like
the
morning
papers
.
Your
stepdaughter
,
as
she
sits
*NL*
there
,
looks
as
if
she
kept
all
the
back
numbers
and
would
bring
*NL*
them
out
some
day
against
me
.
''
She
could
not
teach
herself
to
think
*NL*
favourably
of
Pansy
,
whose
absence
of
initiative
,
of
conversation
,
of
*NL*
personal
claims
,
seemed
to
her
,
in
a
girl
of
twenty
,
unnatural
and
even
*NL*
uncanny
.
Isabel
presently
saw
that
Osmond
would
have
liked
her
to
urge
a
*NL*
little
the
cause
of
her
friend
,
insist
a
little
upon
his
receiving
her
,
*NL*
so
that
he
might
appear
to
suffer
for
good
manners
'
sake
.
Her
immediate
*NL*
acceptance
of
his
objections
put
him
too
much
in
the
wrong
--
it
being
in
*NL*
effect
one
of
the
disadvantages
of
expressing
contempt
that
you
can
not
*NL*
enjoy
at
the
same
time
the
credit
of
expressing
sympathy
.
Osmond
held
*NL*
to
his
credit
,
and
yet
he
held
to
his
objections
--
all
of
which
were
*NL*
elements
difficult
to
reconcile
.
The
right
thing
would
have
been
that
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
should
come
to
dine
at
Palazzo
Roccanera
once
or
twice
,
*NL*
so
that
-LRB-
in
spite
of
his
superficial
civility
,
always
so
great
-RRB-
she
*NL*
might
judge
for
herself
how
little
pleasure
it
gave
him
.
From
the
*NL*
moment
,
however
,
that
both
the
ladies
were
so
unaccommodating
,
there
was
*NL*
nothing
for
Osmond
but
to
wish
the
lady
from
New
York
would
take
herself
*NL*
off
.
It
was
surprising
how
little
satisfaction
he
got
from
his
wife
's
*NL*
friends
;
he
took
occasion
to
call
Isabel
's
attention
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
certainly
not
fortunate
in
your
intimates
;
I
wish
you
might
make
*NL*
a
new
collection
,
''
he
said
to
her
one
morning
in
reference
to
nothing
*NL*
visible
at
the
moment
,
but
in
a
tone
of
ripe
reflection
which
deprived
*NL*
the
remark
of
all
brutal
abruptness
.
``
It
's
as
if
you
had
taken
the
*NL*
trouble
to
pick
out
the
people
in
the
world
that
I
have
least
in
common
*NL*
with
.
Your
cousin
I
have
always
thought
a
conceited
ass
--
besides
his
*NL*
being
the
most
ill-favoured
animal
I
know
.
Then
it
's
insufferably
*NL*
tiresome
that
one
ca
n't
tell
him
so
;
one
must
spare
him
on
account
of
*NL*
his
health
.
His
health
seems
to
me
the
best
part
of
him
;
it
gives
him
*NL*
privileges
enjoyed
by
no
one
else
.
If
he
's
so
desperately
ill
there
's
*NL*
only
one
way
to
prove
it
;
but
he
seems
to
have
no
mind
for
that
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
say
much
more
for
the
great
Warburton
.
When
one
really
thinks
of
it
,
*NL*
the
cool
insolence
of
that
performance
was
something
rare
!
He
comes
and
*NL*
looks
at
one
's
daughter
as
if
she
were
a
suite
of
apartments
;
he
tries
*NL*
the
door-handles
and
looks
out
of
the
windows
,
raps
on
the
walls
and
*NL*
almost
thinks
he
'll
take
the
place
.
Will
you
be
so
good
as
to
draw
up
a
*NL*
lease
?
Then
,
on
the
whole
,
he
decides
that
the
rooms
are
too
small
;
he
*NL*
does
n't
think
he
could
live
on
a
third
floor
;
he
must
look
out
for
a
*NL*
piano
nobile
.
And
he
goes
away
after
having
got
a
month
's
lodging
in
the
*NL*
poor
little
apartment
for
nothing
.
Miss
Stackpole
,
however
,
is
your
most
*NL*
wonderful
invention
.
She
strikes
me
as
a
kind
of
monster
.
One
has
n't
*NL*
a
nerve
in
one
's
body
that
she
does
n't
set
quivering
.
You
know
I
never
*NL*
have
admitted
that
she
's
a
woman
.
Do
you
know
what
she
reminds
me
of
?
Of
*NL*
a
new
steel
pen
--
the
most
odious
thing
in
nature
.
She
talks
as
a
steel
*NL*
pen
writes
;
are
n't
her
letters
,
by
the
way
,
on
ruled
paper
?
She
thinks
*NL*
and
moves
and
walks
and
looks
exactly
as
she
talks
.
You
may
say
that
*NL*
she
does
n't
hurt
me
,
inasmuch
as
I
do
n't
see
her
.
I
do
n't
see
her
,
but
I
*NL*
hear
her
;
I
hear
her
all
day
long
.
Her
voice
is
in
my
ears
;
I
ca
n't
get
*NL*
rid
of
it
.
I
know
exactly
what
she
says
,
and
every
inflexion
of
the
tone
*NL*
in
which
she
says
it
.
She
says
charming
things
about
me
,
and
they
give
*NL*
you
great
comfort
.
I
do
n't
like
at
all
to
think
she
talks
about
me
--
I
*NL*
feel
as
I
should
feel
if
I
knew
the
footman
were
wearing
my
hat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
talked
about
Gilbert
Osmond
,
as
his
wife
assured
him
,
rather
*NL*
less
than
he
suspected
.
She
had
plenty
of
other
subjects
,
in
two
of
*NL*
which
the
reader
may
be
supposed
to
be
especially
interested
.
She
let
*NL*
her
friend
know
that
Caspar
Goodwood
had
discovered
for
himself
that
*NL*
she
was
unhappy
,
though
indeed
her
ingenuity
was
unable
to
suggest
what
*NL*
comfort
he
hoped
to
give
her
by
coming
to
Rome
and
yet
not
calling
*NL*
on
her
.
They
met
him
twice
in
the
street
,
but
he
had
no
appearance
of
*NL*
seeing
them
;
they
were
driving
,
and
he
had
a
habit
of
looking
straight
*NL*
in
front
of
him
,
as
if
he
proposed
to
take
in
but
one
object
at
a
time
.
*NL*
Isabel
could
have
fancied
she
had
seen
him
the
day
before
;
it
must
*NL*
have
been
with
just
that
face
and
step
that
he
had
walked
out
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
's
door
at
the
close
of
their
last
interview
.
He
was
dressed
*NL*
just
as
he
had
been
dressed
on
that
day
,
Isabel
remembered
the
colour
*NL*
of
his
cravat
;
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
familiar
look
there
was
a
*NL*
strangeness
in
his
figure
too
,
something
that
made
her
feel
it
afresh
*NL*
to
be
rather
terrible
he
should
have
come
to
Rome
.
He
looked
bigger
and
*NL*
more
overtopping
than
of
old
,
and
in
those
days
he
certainly
reached
*NL*
high
enough
.
She
noticed
that
the
people
whom
he
passed
looked
back
*NL*
after
him
;
but
he
went
straight
forward
,
lifting
above
them
a
face
like
*NL*
a
February
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
's
other
topic
was
very
different
;
she
gave
Isabel
the
*NL*
latest
news
about
Mr.
Bantling
.
He
had
been
out
in
the
United
States
*NL*
the
year
before
,
and
she
was
happy
to
say
she
had
been
able
to
show
him
*NL*
considerable
attention
.
She
did
n't
know
how
much
he
had
enjoyed
it
,
but
*NL*
she
would
undertake
to
say
it
had
done
him
good
;
he
was
n't
the
same
man
*NL*
when
he
left
as
he
had
been
when
he
came
.
It
had
opened
his
eyes
and
*NL*
shown
him
that
England
was
n't
everything
.
He
had
been
very
much
liked
in
*NL*
most
places
,
and
thought
extremely
simple
--
more
simple
than
the
English
*NL*
were
commonly
supposed
to
be
.
There
were
people
who
had
thought
him
*NL*
affected
;
she
did
n't
know
whether
they
meant
that
his
simplicity
was
an
*NL*
affectation
.
Some
of
his
questions
were
too
discouraging
;
he
thought
all
*NL*
the
chambermaids
were
farmers
'
daughters
--
or
all
the
farmers
'
daughters
*NL*
were
chambermaids
--
she
could
n't
exactly
remember
which
.
He
had
n't
seemed
*NL*
able
to
grasp
the
great
school
system
;
it
had
been
really
too
much
*NL*
for
him
.
On
the
whole
he
had
behaved
as
if
there
were
too
much
of
*NL*
everything
--
as
if
he
could
only
take
in
a
small
part
.
The
part
he
had
*NL*
chosen
was
the
hotel
system
and
the
river
navigation
.
He
had
seemed
*NL*
really
fascinated
with
the
hotels
;
he
had
a
photograph
of
every
one
*NL*
he
had
visited
.
But
the
river
steamers
were
his
principal
interest
;
*NL*
he
wanted
to
do
nothing
but
sail
on
the
big
boats
.
They
had
travelled
*NL*
together
from
New
York
to
Milwaukee
,
stopping
at
the
most
interesting
*NL*
cities
on
the
route
;
and
whenever
they
started
afresh
he
had
wanted
*NL*
to
know
if
they
could
go
by
the
steamer
.
He
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
*NL*
geography
--
had
an
impression
that
Baltimore
was
a
Western
city
and
was
*NL*
perpetually
expecting
to
arrive
at
the
Mississippi
.
He
appeared
never
*NL*
to
have
heard
of
any
river
in
America
but
the
Mississippi
and
was
*NL*
unprepared
to
recognise
the
existence
of
the
Hudson
,
though
obliged
to
*NL*
confess
at
last
that
it
was
fully
equal
to
the
Rhine
.
They
had
spent
*NL*
some
pleasant
hours
in
the
palace-cars
;
he
was
always
ordering
ice-cream
*NL*
from
the
coloured
man
.
He
could
never
get
used
to
that
idea
--
that
you
*NL*
could
get
ice-cream
in
the
cars
.
Of
course
you
could
n't
,
nor
fans
,
*NL*
nor
candy
,
nor
anything
in
the
English
cars
!
He
found
the
heat
quite
*NL*
overwhelming
,
and
she
had
told
him
she
indeed
expected
it
was
*NL*
the
biggest
he
had
ever
experienced
.
He
was
now
in
England
,
*NL*
hunting
--
``
hunting
round
''
Henrietta
called
it
.
These
amusements
were
*NL*
those
of
the
American
red
men
;
we
had
left
that
behind
long
ago
,
the
*NL*
pleasures
of
the
chase
.
It
seemed
to
be
generally
believed
in
England
*NL*
that
we
wore
tomahawks
and
feathers
;
but
such
a
costume
was
more
in
*NL*
keeping
with
English
habits
.
Mr.
Bantling
would
not
have
time
to
join
*NL*
her
in
Italy
,
but
when
she
should
go
to
Paris
again
he
expected
to
come
*NL*
over
.
He
wanted
very
much
to
see
Versailles
again
;
he
was
very
fond
of
*NL*
the
ancient
regime
.
They
did
n't
agree
about
that
,
but
that
was
what
she
*NL*
liked
Versailles
for
,
that
you
could
see
the
ancient
regime
had
been
*NL*
swept
away
.
There
were
no
dukes
and
marquises
there
now
;
she
remembered
*NL*
on
the
contrary
one
day
when
there
were
five
American
families
,
walking
*NL*
all
round
.
Mr.
Bantling
was
very
anxious
that
she
should
take
up
the
*NL*
subject
of
England
again
,
and
he
thought
she
might
get
on
better
with
it
*NL*
now
;
England
had
changed
a
good
deal
within
two
or
three
years
.
He
was
*NL*
determined
that
if
she
went
there
he
should
go
to
see
his
sister
,
Lady
*NL*
Pensil
,
and
that
this
time
the
invitation
should
come
to
her
straight
.
*NL*
The
mystery
about
that
other
one
had
never
been
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
came
at
last
to
Palazzo
Roccanera
;
he
had
written
Isabel
*NL*
a
note
beforehand
,
to
ask
leave
.
This
was
promptly
granted
;
she
would
be
*NL*
at
home
at
six
o'clock
that
afternoon
.
She
spent
the
day
wondering
what
*NL*
he
was
coming
for
--
what
good
he
expected
to
get
of
it
.
He
had
presented
*NL*
himself
hitherto
as
a
person
destitute
of
the
faculty
of
compromise
,
who
*NL*
would
take
what
he
had
asked
for
or
take
nothing
.
Isabel
's
hospitality
,
*NL*
however
,
raised
no
questions
,
and
she
found
no
great
difficulty
in
*NL*
appearing
happy
enough
to
deceive
him
.
It
was
her
conviction
at
*NL*
least
that
she
deceived
him
,
made
him
say
to
himself
that
he
had
*NL*
been
misinformed
.
But
she
also
saw
,
so
she
believed
,
that
he
was
not
*NL*
disappointed
,
as
some
other
men
,
she
was
sure
,
would
have
been
;
he
had
*NL*
not
come
to
Rome
to
look
for
an
opportunity
.
She
never
found
out
what
he
*NL*
had
come
for
;
he
offered
her
no
explanation
;
there
could
be
none
but
the
*NL*
very
simple
one
that
he
wanted
to
see
her
.
In
other
words
he
had
come
*NL*
for
his
amusement
.
Isabel
followed
up
this
induction
with
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
eagerness
,
and
was
delighted
to
have
found
a
formula
that
would
lay
the
*NL*
ghost
of
this
gentleman
's
ancient
grievance
.
If
he
had
come
to
Rome
*NL*
for
his
amusement
this
was
exactly
what
she
wanted
;
for
if
he
cared
*NL*
for
amusement
he
had
got
over
his
heartache
.
If
he
had
got
over
his
*NL*
heartache
everything
was
as
it
should
be
and
her
responsibilities
were
*NL*
at
an
end
.
It
was
true
that
he
took
his
recreation
a
little
stiffly
,
but
*NL*
he
had
never
been
loose
and
easy
and
she
had
every
reason
to
believe
*NL*
he
was
satisfied
with
what
he
saw
.
Henrietta
was
not
in
his
confidence
,
*NL*
though
he
was
in
hers
,
and
Isabel
consequently
received
no
side-light
*NL*
upon
his
state
of
mind
.
He
was
open
to
little
conversation
on
general
*NL*
topics
;
it
came
back
to
her
that
she
had
said
of
him
once
,
years
before
,
*NL*
``
Mr.
Goodwood
speaks
a
good
deal
,
but
he
does
n't
talk
.
''
He
spoke
a
good
*NL*
deal
now
,
but
he
talked
perhaps
as
little
as
ever
;
considering
,
that
is
,
*NL*
how
much
there
was
in
Rome
to
talk
about
.
His
arrival
was
not
calculated
*NL*
to
simplify
her
relations
with
her
husband
,
for
if
Mr.
Osmond
did
n't
*NL*
like
her
friends
Mr.
Goodwood
had
no
claim
upon
his
attention
save
as
*NL*
having
been
one
of
the
first
of
them
.
There
was
nothing
for
her
to
say
*NL*
of
him
but
that
he
was
the
very
oldest
;
this
rather
meagre
synthesis
*NL*
exhausted
the
facts
.
She
had
been
obliged
to
introduce
him
to
Gilbert
;
*NL*
it
was
impossible
she
should
not
ask
him
to
dinner
,
to
her
Thursday
*NL*
evenings
,
of
which
she
had
grown
very
weary
,
but
to
which
her
husband
*NL*
still
held
for
the
sake
not
so
much
of
inviting
people
as
of
not
*NL*
inviting
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
Thursdays
Mr.
Goodwood
came
regularly
,
solemnly
,
rather
early
;
*NL*
he
appeared
to
regard
them
with
a
good
deal
of
gravity
.
Isabel
every
*NL*
now
and
then
had
a
moment
of
anger
;
there
was
something
so
literal
about
*NL*
him
;
she
thought
he
might
know
that
she
did
n't
know
what
to
do
with
him
.
*NL*
But
she
could
n't
call
him
stupid
;
he
was
not
that
in
the
least
;
he
was
*NL*
only
extraordinarily
honest
.
To
be
as
honest
as
that
made
a
man
very
*NL*
different
from
most
people
;
one
had
to
be
almost
equally
honest
with
*NL*
HIM
.
She
made
this
latter
reflection
at
the
very
time
she
was
flattering
*NL*
herself
she
had
persuaded
him
that
she
was
the
most
light-hearted
of
*NL*
women
.
He
never
threw
any
doubt
on
this
point
,
never
asked
her
any
*NL*
personal
questions
.
He
got
on
much
better
with
Osmond
than
had
seemed
*NL*
probable
.
Osmond
had
a
great
dislike
to
being
counted
on
;
in
such
a
case
*NL*
he
had
an
irresistible
need
of
disappointing
you
.
It
was
in
virtue
of
*NL*
this
principle
that
he
gave
himself
the
entertainment
of
taking
a
fancy
*NL*
to
a
perpendicular
Bostonian
whom
he
had
been
depended
upon
to
treat
*NL*
with
coldness
.
He
asked
Isabel
if
Mr.
Goodwood
also
had
wanted
to
marry
*NL*
her
,
and
expressed
surprise
at
her
not
having
accepted
him
.
It
would
*NL*
have
been
an
excellent
thing
,
like
living
under
some
tall
belfry
which
*NL*
would
strike
all
the
hours
and
make
a
queer
vibration
in
the
upper
air
.
*NL*
He
declared
he
liked
to
talk
with
the
great
Goodwood
;
it
was
n't
easy
at
*NL*
first
,
you
had
to
climb
up
an
interminable
steep
staircase
up
to
the
*NL*
top
of
the
tower
;
but
when
you
got
there
you
had
a
big
view
and
felt
a
*NL*
little
fresh
breeze
.
Osmond
,
as
we
know
,
had
delightful
qualities
,
and
*NL*
he
gave
Caspar
Goodwood
the
benefit
of
them
all
.
Isabel
could
see
that
*NL*
Mr.
Goodwood
thought
better
of
her
husband
than
he
had
ever
wished
*NL*
to
;
he
had
given
her
the
impression
that
morning
in
Florence
of
being
*NL*
inaccessible
to
a
good
impression
.
Gilbert
asked
him
repeatedly
to
*NL*
dinner
,
and
Mr.
Goodwood
smoked
a
cigar
with
him
afterwards
and
even
*NL*
desired
to
be
shown
his
collections
.
Gilbert
said
to
Isabel
that
he
was
*NL*
very
original
;
he
was
as
strong
and
of
as
good
a
style
as
an
English
*NL*
portmanteau
,
--
he
had
plenty
of
straps
and
buckles
which
would
never
wear
*NL*
out
,
and
a
capital
patent
lock
.
Caspar
Goodwood
took
to
riding
on
the
*NL*
Campagna
and
devoted
much
time
to
this
exercise
;
it
was
therefore
mainly
*NL*
in
the
evening
that
Isabel
saw
him
.
She
bethought
herself
of
saying
to
*NL*
him
one
day
that
if
he
were
willing
he
could
render
her
a
service
.
And
*NL*
then
she
added
smiling
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
however
,
what
right
I
have
to
ask
a
service
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
the
person
in
the
world
who
has
most
right
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
've
*NL*
given
you
assurances
that
I
've
never
given
any
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
service
was
that
he
should
go
and
see
her
cousin
Ralph
,
who
was
ill
*NL*
at
the
Hotel
de
Paris
,
alone
,
and
be
as
kind
to
him
as
possible
.
Mr.
*NL*
Goodwood
had
never
seen
him
,
but
he
would
know
who
the
poor
fellow
*NL*
was
;
if
she
was
not
mistaken
Ralph
had
once
invited
him
to
Gardencourt
.
*NL*
Caspar
remembered
the
invitation
perfectly
,
and
,
though
he
was
not
*NL*
supposed
to
be
a
man
of
imagination
,
had
enough
to
put
himself
in
the
*NL*
place
of
a
poor
gentleman
who
lay
dying
at
a
Roman
inn
.
He
called
at
the
*NL*
Hotel
de
Paris
and
,
on
being
shown
into
the
presence
of
the
master
of
*NL*
Gardencourt
,
found
Miss
Stackpole
sitting
beside
his
sofa
.
A
singular
*NL*
change
had
in
fact
occurred
in
this
lady
's
relations
with
Ralph
*NL*
Touchett
.
She
had
not
been
asked
by
Isabel
to
go
and
see
him
,
but
on
*NL*
hearing
that
he
was
too
ill
to
come
out
had
immediately
gone
of
her
*NL*
own
motion
.
After
this
she
had
paid
him
a
daily
visit
--
always
under
*NL*
the
conviction
that
they
were
great
enemies
.
``
Oh
yes
,
we
're
intimate
*NL*
enemies
,
''
Ralph
used
to
say
;
and
he
accused
her
freely
--
as
freely
as
the
*NL*
humour
of
it
would
allow
--
of
coming
to
worry
him
to
death
.
In
reality
*NL*
they
became
excellent
friends
,
Henrietta
much
wondering
that
she
should
*NL*
never
have
liked
him
before
.
Ralph
liked
her
exactly
as
much
as
he
had
*NL*
always
done
;
he
had
never
doubted
for
a
moment
that
she
was
an
excellent
*NL*
fellow
.
They
talked
about
everything
and
always
differed
;
about
*NL*
everything
,
that
is
,
but
Isabel
--
a
topic
as
to
which
Ralph
always
had
*NL*
a
thin
forefinger
on
his
lips
.
Mr.
Bantling
on
the
other
hand
proved
*NL*
a
great
resource
;
Ralph
was
capable
of
discussing
Mr.
Bantling
with
*NL*
Henrietta
for
hours
.
Discussion
was
stimulated
of
course
by
their
*NL*
inevitable
difference
of
view
--
Ralph
having
amused
himself
with
taking
*NL*
the
ground
that
the
genial
ex-guardsman
was
a
regular
Machiavelli
.
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
could
contribute
nothing
to
such
a
debate
;
but
after
*NL*
he
had
been
left
alone
with
his
host
he
found
there
were
various
other
*NL*
matters
they
could
take
up
.
It
must
be
admitted
that
the
lady
who
had
*NL*
just
gone
out
was
not
one
of
these
;
Caspar
granted
all
Miss
Stackpole
's
*NL*
merits
in
advance
,
but
had
no
further
remark
to
make
about
her
.
Neither
,
*NL*
after
the
first
allusions
,
did
the
two
men
expatiate
upon
Mrs.
Osmond
--
a
*NL*
theme
in
which
Goodwood
perceived
as
many
dangers
as
Ralph
.
He
felt
very
*NL*
sorry
for
that
unclassable
personage
;
he
could
n't
bear
to
see
a
pleasant
*NL*
man
,
so
pleasant
for
all
his
queerness
,
so
beyond
anything
to
be
done
.
*NL*
There
was
always
something
to
be
done
,
for
Goodwood
,
and
he
did
it
in
*NL*
this
case
by
repeating
several
times
his
visit
to
the
Hotel
de
Paris
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
Isabel
that
she
had
been
very
clever
;
she
had
artfully
*NL*
disposed
of
the
superfluous
Caspar
.
She
had
given
him
an
occupation
;
she
*NL*
had
converted
him
into
a
caretaker
of
Ralph
.
She
had
a
plan
of
making
*NL*
him
travel
northward
with
her
cousin
as
soon
as
the
first
mild
weather
*NL*
should
allow
it
.
Lord
Warburton
had
brought
Ralph
to
Rome
and
Mr.
*NL*
Goodwood
should
take
him
away
.
There
seemed
a
happy
symmetry
in
this
,
*NL*
and
she
was
now
intensely
eager
that
Ralph
should
depart
.
She
had
a
*NL*
constant
fear
he
would
die
there
before
her
eyes
and
a
horror
of
the
*NL*
occurrence
of
this
event
at
an
inn
,
by
her
door
,
which
he
had
so
rarely
*NL*
entered
.
Ralph
must
sink
to
his
last
rest
in
his
own
dear
house
,
in
*NL*
one
of
those
deep
,
dim
chambers
of
Gardencourt
where
the
dark
ivy
would
*NL*
cluster
round
the
edges
of
the
glimmering
window
.
There
seemed
to
Isabel
*NL*
in
these
days
something
sacred
in
Gardencourt
;
no
chapter
of
the
past
*NL*
was
more
perfectly
irrecoverable
.
When
she
thought
of
the
months
she
had
*NL*
spent
there
the
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
.
She
flattered
herself
,
as
I
*NL*
say
,
upon
her
ingenuity
,
but
she
had
need
of
all
she
could
muster
;
*NL*
for
several
events
occurred
which
seemed
to
confront
and
defy
her
.
The
*NL*
Countess
Gemini
arrived
from
Florence
--
arrived
with
her
trunks
,
her
*NL*
dresses
,
her
chatter
,
her
falsehoods
,
her
frivolity
,
the
strange
,
the
*NL*
unholy
legend
of
the
number
of
her
lovers
.
Edward
Rosier
,
who
had
been
*NL*
away
somewhere
,
--
no
one
,
not
even
Pansy
,
knew
where
,
--
reappeared
in
Rome
*NL*
and
began
to
write
her
long
letters
,
which
she
never
answered
.
Madame
*NL*
Merle
returned
from
Naples
and
said
to
her
with
a
strange
smile
:
``
What
*NL*
on
earth
did
you
do
with
Lord
Warburton
?
''
As
if
it
were
any
business
of
*NL*
hers
!

CHAPTER
XLVIII
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
toward
the
end
of
February
,
Ralph
Touchett
made
up
his
mind
to
*NL*
return
to
England
.
He
had
his
own
reasons
for
this
decision
,
which
*NL*
he
was
not
bound
to
communicate
;
but
Henrietta
Stackpole
,
to
whom
he
*NL*
mentioned
his
intention
,
flattered
herself
that
she
guessed
them
.
She
*NL*
forbore
to
express
them
,
however
;
she
only
said
,
after
a
moment
,
as
she
*NL*
sat
by
his
sofa
:
``
I
suppose
you
know
you
ca
n't
go
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
idea
of
doing
that
,
''
Ralph
answered
.
``
I
shall
have
people
with
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
`
people
'
?
Servants
whom
you
pay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Ralph
jocosely
,
``
after
all
,
they
're
human
beings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
any
women
among
them
?
''
Miss
Stackpole
desired
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
as
if
I
had
a
dozen
!
No
,
I
confess
I
have
n't
a
soubrette
in
*NL*
my
employment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Henrietta
calmly
,
``
you
ca
n't
go
to
England
that
way
.
You
*NL*
must
have
a
woman
's
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
so
much
of
yours
for
the
past
fortnight
that
it
will
last
me
a
*NL*
good
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
not
had
enough
of
it
yet
.
I
guess
I
'll
go
with
you

''
said
*NL*
Henrietta
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
with
me
?
''
Ralph
slowly
raised
himself
from
his
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
you
do
n't
like
me
,
but
I
'll
go
with
you
all
the
same
.
It
*NL*
would
be
better
for
your
health
to
lie
down
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
looked
at
her
a
little
;
then
he
slowly
relapsed
.
``
I
like
you
very
*NL*
much
,
''
he
said
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
gave
one
of
her
infrequent
laughs
.
``
You
need
n't
think
*NL*
that
by
saying
that
you
can
buy
me
off
.
I
'll
go
with
you
,
and
what
is
*NL*
more
I
'll
take
care
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
very
good
woman
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
till
I
get
you
safely
home
before
you
say
that
.
It
wo
n't
be
easy
.
*NL*
But
you
had
better
go
,
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
she
left
him
,
Ralph
said
to
her
:
``
Do
you
really
mean
to
take
care
*NL*
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
mean
to
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
notify
you
then
that
I
submit
.
Oh
,
I
submit
!
''
And
it
was
perhaps
a
*NL*
sign
of
submission
that
a
few
minutes
after
she
had
left
him
alone
he
*NL*
burst
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
.
It
seemed
to
him
so
inconsequent
,
*NL*
such
a
conclusive
proof
of
his
having
abdicated
all
functions
and
*NL*
renounced
all
exercise
,
that
he
should
start
on
a
journey
across
Europe
*NL*
under
the
supervision
of
Miss
Stackpole
.
And
the
great
oddity
was
that
*NL*
the
prospect
pleased
him
;
he
was
gratefully
,
luxuriously
passive
.
He
*NL*
felt
even
impatient
to
start
;
and
indeed
he
had
an
immense
longing
to
*NL*
see
his
own
house
again
.
The
end
of
everything
was
at
hand
;
it
seemed
*NL*
to
him
he
could
stretch
out
his
arm
and
touch
the
goal
.
But
he
wanted
to
*NL*
die
at
home
;
it
was
the
only
wish
he
had
left
--
to
extend
himself
in
the
*NL*
large
quiet
room
where
he
had
last
seen
his
father
lie
,
and
close
his
*NL*
eyes
upon
the
summer
dawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
day
Caspar
Goodwood
came
to
see
him
,
and
he
informed
his
*NL*
visitor
that
Miss
Stackpole
had
taken
him
up
and
was
to
conduct
him
back
*NL*
to
England
.
``
Ah
then
,
''
said
Caspar
,
``
I
'm
afraid
I
shall
be
a
fifth
wheel
*NL*
to
the
coach
.
Mrs.
Osmond
has
made
me
promise
to
go
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
--
it
's
the
golden
age
!
You
're
all
too
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
kindness
on
my
part
is
to
her
;
it
's
hardly
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Granting
that
,
SHE
'S
kind
,
''
smiled
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
get
people
to
go
with
you
?
Yes
,
that
's
a
sort
of
kindness
,
''
Goodwood
*NL*
answered
without
lending
himself
to
the
joke
.
``
For
myself
,
however
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
I
'll
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
I
would
much
rather
travel
with
*NL*
you
and
Miss
Stackpole
than
with
Miss
Stackpole
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
'd
rather
stay
here
than
do
either
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
There
's
really
*NL*
no
need
of
your
coming
.
Henrietta
's
extraordinarily
efficient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
of
that
.
But
I
've
promised
Mrs.
Osmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
easily
get
her
to
let
you
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
n't
let
me
off
for
the
world
.
She
wants
me
to
look
after
you
,
*NL*
but
that
is
n't
the
principal
thing
.
The
principal
thing
is
that
she
*NL*
wants
me
to
leave
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
see
too
much
in
it
,
''
Ralph
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bore
her
,
''
Goodwood
went
on
;
``
she
has
nothing
to
say
to
me
,
so
she
*NL*
invented
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
then
,
if
it
's
a
convenience
to
her
I
certainly
will
take
you
with
*NL*
me
.
Though
I
do
n't
see
why
it
should
be
a
convenience
,
''
Ralph
added
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Caspar
Goodwood
simply
,
``
she
thinks
I
'm
watching
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Watching
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trying
to
make
out
if
she
's
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
easy
to
make
out
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
She
's
the
most
visibly
happy
*NL*
woman
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
;
I
'm
satisfied
,
''
Goodwood
answered
dryly
.
For
all
his
*NL*
dryness
,
however
,
he
had
more
to
say
.
``
I
've
been
watching
her
;
I
was
*NL*
an
old
friend
and
it
seemed
to
me
I
had
the
right
.
She
pretends
to
be
*NL*
happy
;
that
was
what
she
undertook
to
be
;
and
I
thought
I
should
like
to
*NL*
see
for
myself
what
it
amounts
to
.
I
've
seen
,
''
he
continued
with
a
harsh
*NL*
ring
in
his
voice
,
``
and
I
do
n't
want
to
see
any
more
.
I
'm
now
quite
*NL*
ready
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
it
strikes
me
as
about
time
you
should
?
''
Ralph
rejoined
.
*NL*
And
this
was
the
only
conversation
these
gentlemen
had
about
Isabel
*NL*
Osmond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
made
her
preparations
for
departure
,
and
among
them
she
found
*NL*
it
proper
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
Countess
Gemini
,
who
returned
at
*NL*
Miss
Stackpole
's
pension
the
visit
which
this
lady
had
paid
her
in
*NL*
Florence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
very
wrong
about
Lord
Warburton
,
''
she
remarked
to
the
*NL*
Countess
.
``
I
think
it
right
you
should
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
his
making
love
to
Isabel
?
My
poor
lady
,
he
was
at
her
house
*NL*
three
times
a
day
.
He
has
left
traces
of
his
passage
!
''
the
Countess
*NL*
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wished
to
marry
your
niece
;
that
's
why
he
came
to
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
stared
,
and
then
with
an
inconsiderate
laugh
:
``
Is
that
the
*NL*
story
that
Isabel
tells
?
It
is
n't
bad
,
as
such
things
go
.
If
he
wishes
*NL*
to
marry
my
niece
,
pray
why
does
n't
he
do
it
?
Perhaps
he
has
gone
to
buy
*NL*
the
wedding-ring
and
will
come
back
with
it
next
month
,
after
I
'm
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
'll
not
come
back
.
Miss
Osmond
does
n't
wish
to
marry
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
very
accommodating
!
I
knew
she
was
fond
of
Isabel
,
but
I
did
n't
*NL*
know
she
carried
it
so
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
''
said
Henrietta
coldly
,
and
reflecting
that
*NL*
the
Countess
was
unpleasantly
perverse
.
``
I
really
must
stick
to
my
*NL*
point
--
that
Isabel
never
encouraged
the
attentions
of
Lord
Warburton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend
,
what
do
you
and
I
know
about
it
?
All
we
know
is
that
my
*NL*
brother
's
capable
of
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
your
brother
's
capable
of
,
''
said
Henrietta
with
*NL*
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
her
encouraging
Warburton
that
I
complain
of
;
it
's
her
sending
*NL*
him
away
.
I
want
particularly
to
see
him
.
Do
you
suppose
she
thought
*NL*
I
would
make
him
faithless
?
''
the
Countess
continued
with
audacious
*NL*
insistence
.
``
However
,
she
's
only
keeping
him
,
one
can
feel
that
.
The
*NL*
house
is
full
of
him
there
;
he
's
quite
in
the
air
.
Oh
yes
,
he
has
left
*NL*
traces
;
I
'm
sure
I
shall
see
him
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Henrietta
after
a
little
,
with
one
of
those
inspirations
*NL*
which
had
made
the
fortune
of
her
letters
to
the
Interviewer
,
``
perhaps
*NL*
he
'll
be
more
successful
with
you
than
with
Isabel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
told
her
friend
of
the
offer
she
had
made
Ralph
Isabel
replied
*NL*
that
she
could
have
done
nothing
that
would
have
pleased
her
more
.
It
*NL*
had
always
been
her
faith
that
at
bottom
Ralph
and
this
young
woman
were
*NL*
made
to
understand
each
other
.
``
I
do
n't
care
whether
he
understands
me
*NL*
or
not
,
''
Henrietta
declared
.
``
The
great
thing
is
that
he
should
n't
die
*NL*
in
the
cars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't
do
that
,
''
Isabel
said
,
shaking
her
head
with
an
extension
of
*NL*
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't
if
I
can
help
it
.
I
see
you
want
us
all
to
go
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
you
want
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
be
alone
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
be
that
so
long
as
you
've
so
much
company
at
home

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
they
're
part
of
the
comedy
.
You
others
are
spectators
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
it
a
comedy
,
Isabel
Archer
?
''
Henrietta
rather
grimly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tragedy
then
if
you
like
.
You
're
all
looking
at
me
;
it
makes
me
*NL*
uncomfortable

''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
engaged
in
this
act
for
a
while
.
``
You
're
like
the
stricken
*NL*
deer
,
seeking
the
innermost
shade
.
Oh
,
you
do
give
me
such
a
sense
of
*NL*
helplessness
!
''
she
broke
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
at
all
helpless
.
There
are
many
things
I
mean
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
you
I
'm
speaking
of
;
it
's
myself
.
It
's
too
much
,
having
come
*NL*
on
purpose
,
to
leave
you
just
as
I
find
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
do
that
;
you
leave
me
much
refreshed
,
''
Isabel
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
mild
refreshment
--
sour
lemonade
!
I
want
you
to
promise
me
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
do
that

I
shall
never
make
another
promise

I
made
such
a
*NL*
solemn
one
four
years
ago
,
and
I
've
succeeded
so
ill
in
keeping
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
had
no
encouragement

In
this
case
I
should
give
you
the
*NL*
greatest

before
the
worst
comes
;
that
's
what
I
want
*NL*
you
to
promise

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
worst
?
What
do
you
call
the
worst
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
your
character
gets
spoiled

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
my
disposition
?
It
wo
n't
get
spoiled
,
''
Isabel
answered
,
*NL*
smiling
.
``
I
'm
taking
very
good
care
of
it
.
I
'm
extremely
struck
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
turning
away
,
``
with
the
off-hand
way
in
which
you
speak
of
a
*NL*
woman
's
leaving
her
husband
.
It
's
easy
to
see
you
've
never
had
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Henrietta
as
if
she
were
beginning
an
argument
,
``
nothing
is
*NL*
more
common
in
our
Western
cities
,
and
it
's
to
them
,
after
all
,
that
we
*NL*
must
look
in
the
future
.
''
Her
argument
,
however
,
does
not
concern
this
*NL*
history
,
which
has
too
many
other
threads
to
unwind
.
She
announced
to
*NL*
Ralph
Touchett
that
she
was
ready
to
leave
Rome
by
any
train
he
might
*NL*
designate
,
and
Ralph
immediately
pulled
himself
together
for
departure
.
*NL*
Isabel
went
to
see
him
at
the
last
,
and
he
made
the
same
remark
that
*NL*
Henrietta
had
made
.
It
struck
him
that
Isabel
was
uncommonly
glad
to
get
*NL*
rid
of
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
answer
to
this
she
gently
laid
her
hand
on
his
,
and
said
in
a
*NL*
low
tone
,
with
a
quick
smile
:
``
My
dear
Ralph
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
answer
enough
,
and
he
was
quite
contented
.
But
he
went
on
in
the
*NL*
same
way
,
jocosely
,
ingenuously
:
``
I
've
seen
less
of
you
than
I
might
,
*NL*
but
it
's
better
than
nothing
.
And
then
I
've
heard
a
great
deal
about
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
from
whom
,
leading
the
life
you
've
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
voices
of
the
air
!
Oh
,
from
no
one
else
;
I
never
let
other
*NL*
people
speak
of
you
.
They
always
say
you
're
`
charming
,
'
and
that
's
so
*NL*
flat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
have
seen
more
of
you
certainly
,
''
Isabel
said
.
``
But
when
one
's
*NL*
married
one
has
so
much
occupation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortunately
I
'm
not
married

all
the
freedom
of
a
bachelor
.
''
He
*NL*
continued
to
talk
as
if
they
should
certainly
meet
again
,
and
succeeded
*NL*
in
making
the
assumption
appear
almost
just
.
He
made
no
allusion
to
*NL*
his
term
being
near
,
to
the
probability
that
he
should
not
outlast
the
*NL*
summer
.
If
he
preferred
it
so
,
Isabel
was
willing
enough
;
the
reality
*NL*
was
sufficiently
distinct
without
their
erecting
finger-posts
in
*NL*
conversation
.
That
had
been
well
enough
for
the
earlier
time
,
though
*NL*
about
this
,
as
about
his
other
affairs
,
Ralph
had
never
been
egotistic
.
*NL*
Isabel
spoke
of
his
journey
,
of
the
stages
into
which
he
should
*NL*
divide
it
,
of
the
precautions
he
should
take
.
``
Henrietta
's
my
greatest
*NL*
precaution
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
The
conscience
of
that
woman
's
sublime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
she
'll
be
very
conscientious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
be
?
She
has
been
!
It
's
only
because
she
thinks
it
's
her
duty
that
*NL*
she
goes
with
me
.
There
's
a
conception
of
duty
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
a
generous
one
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
and
it
makes
me
deeply
*NL*
ashamed
.
I
ought
to
go
with
you
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
husband
would
n't
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
would
n't
like
it
.
But
I
might
go
,
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
startled
by
the
boldness
of
your
imagination
.
Fancy
my
being
a
*NL*
cause
of
disagreement
between
a
lady
and
her
husband
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
why
I
do
n't
go
,
''
said
Isabel
simply
--
yet
not
very
lucidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
understood
well
enough
,
however
.
``
I
should
think
so
,
with
all
*NL*
those
occupations
you
speak
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
that
.
I
'm
afraid
,
''
said
Isabel
.
After
a
pause
she
repeated
,
as
*NL*
if
to
make
herself
,
rather
than
him
,
hear
the
words
:
``
I
'm
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
could
hardly
tell
what
her
tone
meant
;
it
was
so
strangely
*NL*
deliberate
--
apparently
so
void
of
emotion
.
Did
she
wish
to
do
public
*NL*
penance
for
a
fault
of
which
she
had
not
been
convicted
?
or
were
her
*NL*
words
simply
an
attempt
at
enlightened
self-analysis
?
However
this
*NL*
might
be
,
Ralph
could
not
resist
so
easy
an
opportunity
.
``
Afraid
of
your
*NL*
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
of
myself
!
''
she
said
,
getting
up
.
She
stood
there
a
moment
and
*NL*
then
added
:
``
If
I
were
afraid
of
my
husband
that
would
be
simply
my
*NL*
duty
.
That
's
what
women
are
expected
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
''
laughed
Ralph
;
``
but
to
make
up
for
it
there
's
always
some
man
*NL*
awfully
afraid
of
some
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
no
heed
to
this
pleasantry
,
but
suddenly
took
a
different
*NL*
turn
.
``
With
Henrietta
at
the
head
of
your
little
band
,
''
she
exclaimed
*NL*
abruptly
,
``
there
will
be
nothing
left
for
Mr.
Goodwood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
Isabel
,
''
Ralph
answered
,
``
he
's
used
to
that
.
There
is
*NL*
nothing
left
for
Mr.
Goodwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
coloured
and
then
observed
,
quickly
,
that
she
must
leave
him
.
They
*NL*
stood
together
a
moment
;
both
her
hands
were
in
both
of
his
.
``
You
've
*NL*
been
my
best
friend
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
for
you
that
I
wanted
--
that
I
wanted
to
live
.
But
I
'm
of
no
use
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
came
over
her
more
poignantly
that
she
should
not
see
him
again
.
*NL*
She
could
not
accept
that
;
she
could
not
part
with
him
that
way
.
``
If
you
*NL*
should
send
for
me
I
'd
come
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
husband
wo
n't
consent
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
can
arrange
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
keep
that
for
my
last
pleasure
!
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
answer
to
which
she
simply
kissed
him
.
It
was
a
Thursday
,
and
that
*NL*
evening
Caspar
Goodwood
came
to
Palazzo
Roccanera
.
He
was
among
the
*NL*
first
to
arrive
,
and
he
spent
some
time
in
conversation
with
Gilbert
*NL*
Osmond
,
who
almost
always
was
present
when
his
wife
received
.
They
sat
*NL*
down
together
,
and
Osmond
,
talkative
,
communicative
,
expansive
,
seemed
*NL*
possessed
with
a
kind
of
intellectual
gaiety
.
He
leaned
back
with
his
*NL*
legs
crossed
,
lounging
and
chatting
,
while
Goodwood
,
more
restless
,
but
*NL*
not
at
all
lively
,
shifted
his
position
,
played
with
his
hat
,
made
the
*NL*
little
sofa
creak
beneath
him
.
Osmond
's
face
wore
a
sharp
,
aggressive
*NL*
smile
;
he
was
as
a
man
whose
perceptions
have
been
quickened
by
good
*NL*
news
.
He
remarked
to
Goodwood
that
he
was
sorry
they
were
to
lose
him
;
*NL*
he
himself
should
particularly
miss
him
.
He
saw
so
few
intelligent
*NL*
men
--
they
were
surprisingly
scarce
in
Rome
.
He
must
be
sure
to
come
*NL*
back
;
there
was
something
very
refreshing
,
to
an
inveterate
Italian
like
*NL*
himself
,
in
talking
with
a
genuine
outsider
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
fond
of
Rome
,
you
know
,
''
Osmond
said
;
``
but
there
's
nothing
*NL*
I
like
better
than
to
meet
people
who
have
n't
that
superstition
.
The
*NL*
modern
world
's
after
all
very
fine
.
Now
you
're
thoroughly
modern
and
yet
*NL*
are
not
at
all
common
.
So
many
of
the
moderns
we
see
are
such
very
poor
*NL*
stuff
.
If
they
're
the
children
of
the
future
we
're
willing
to
die
young
.
*NL*
Of
course
the
ancients
too
are
often
very
tiresome
.
My
wife
and
I
like
*NL*
everything
that
's
really
new
--
not
the
mere
pretence
of
it
.
There
's
*NL*
nothing
new
,
unfortunately
,
in
ignorance
and
stupidity
.
We
see
plenty
*NL*
of
that
in
forms
that
offer
themselves
as
a
revelation
of
progress
,
of
*NL*
light
.
A
revelation
of
vulgarity
!
There
's
a
certain
kind
of
vulgarity
*NL*
which
I
believe
is
really
new
;
I
do
n't
think
there
ever
was
anything
*NL*
like
it
before
.
Indeed
I
do
n't
find
vulgarity
,
at
all
,
before
the
*NL*
present
century
.
You
see
a
faint
menace
of
it
here
and
there
in
the
*NL*
last
,
but
to-day
the
air
has
grown
so
dense
that
delicate
things
*NL*
are
literally
not
recognised
.
Now
,
we
've
liked
you
--
!
''
With
which
*NL*
he
hesitated
a
moment
,
laying
his
hand
gently
on
Goodwood
's
knee
and
*NL*
smiling
with
a
mixture
of
assurance
and
embarrassment
.
``
I
'm
going
to
say
*NL*
something
extremely
offensive
and
patronising
,
but
you
must
let
me
*NL*
have
the
satisfaction
of
it
.
We
've
liked
you
because
--
because
you
've
*NL*
reconciled
us
a
little
to
the
future
.
If
there
are
to
be
a
certain
*NL*
number
of
people
like
you
--
a
la
bonne
heure
!
I
'm
talking
for
my
wife
as
*NL*
well
as
for
myself
,
you
see
.
She
speaks
for
me
,
my
wife
;
why
should
n't
*NL*
I
speak
for
her
?
We
're
as
united
,
you
know
,
as
the
candlestick
and
the
*NL*
snuffers
.
Am
I
assuming
too
much
when
I
say
that
I
think
I
've
understood
*NL*
from
you
that
your
occupations
have
been
--
a
--
commercial
?
There
's
a
*NL*
danger
in
that
,
you
know
;
but
it
's
the
way
you
have
escaped
that
*NL*
strikes
us
.
Excuse
me
if
my
little
compliment
seems
in
execrable
taste
;
*NL*
fortunately
my
wife
does
n't
hear
me
.
What
I
mean
is
that
you
might
have
*NL*
been
--
a
--
what
I
was
mentioning
just
now
.
The
whole
American
world
was
*NL*
in
a
conspiracy
to
make
you
so
.
But
you
resisted
,
you
've
something
about
*NL*
you
that
saved
you
.
And
yet
you
're
so
modern
,
so
modern
;
the
most
modern
*NL*
man
we
know
!
We
shall
always
be
delighted
to
see
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
said
that
Osmond
was
in
good
humour
,
and
these
remarks
will
give
*NL*
ample
evidence
of
the
fact
.
They
were
infinitely
more
personal
than
he
*NL*
usually
cared
to
be
,
and
if
Caspar
Goodwood
had
attended
to
them
more
*NL*
closely
he
might
have
thought
that
the
defence
of
delicacy
was
in
rather
*NL*
odd
hands
.
We
may
believe
,
however
,
that
Osmond
knew
very
well
what
*NL*
he
was
about
,
and
that
if
he
chose
to
use
the
tone
of
patronage
with
a
*NL*
grossness
not
in
his
habits
he
had
an
excellent
reason
for
the
escapade
.
*NL*
Goodwood
had
only
a
vague
sense
that
he
was
laying
it
on
somehow
;
he
*NL*
scarcely
knew
where
the
mixture
was
applied
.
Indeed
he
scarcely
knew
*NL*
what
Osmond
was
talking
about
;
he
wanted
to
be
alone
with
Isabel
,
and
*NL*
that
idea
spoke
louder
to
him
than
her
husband
's
perfectly-pitched
*NL*
voice
.
He
watched
her
talking
with
other
people
and
wondered
when
she
*NL*
would
be
at
liberty
and
whether
he
might
ask
her
to
go
into
one
of
the
*NL*
other
rooms
.
His
humour
was
not
,
like
Osmond
's
,
of
the
best
;
there
was
*NL*
an
element
of
dull
rage
in
his
consciousness
of
things
.
Up
to
this
time
*NL*
he
had
not
disliked
Osmond
personally
;
he
had
only
thought
him
very
*NL*
well-informed
and
obliging
and
more
than
he
had
supposed
like
the
person
*NL*
whom
Isabel
Archer
would
naturally
marry
.
His
host
had
won
in
the
open
*NL*
field
a
great
advantage
over
him
,
and
Goodwood
had
too
strong
a
sense
*NL*
of
fair
play
to
have
been
moved
to
underrate
him
on
that
account
.
He
*NL*
had
not
tried
positively
to
think
well
of
him
;
this
was
a
flight
of
*NL*
sentimental
benevolence
of
which
,
even
in
the
days
when
he
came
*NL*
nearest
to
reconciling
himself
to
what
had
happened
,
Goodwood
was
*NL*
quite
incapable
.
He
accepted
him
as
rather
a
brilliant
personage
of
the
*NL*
amateurish
kind
,
afflicted
with
a
redundancy
of
leisure
which
it
amused
*NL*
him
to
work
off
in
little
refinements
of
conversation
.
But
he
only
half
*NL*
trusted
him
;
he
could
never
make
out
why
the
deuce
Osmond
should
lavish
*NL*
refinements
of
any
sort
upon
HIM
.
It
made
him
suspect
that
he
found
some
*NL*
private
entertainment
in
it
,
and
it
ministered
to
a
general
impression
*NL*
that
his
triumphant
rival
had
in
his
composition
a
streak
of
perversity
.
*NL*
He
knew
indeed
that
Osmond
could
have
no
reason
to
wish
him
evil
;
he
*NL*
had
nothing
to
fear
from
him
.
He
had
carried
off
a
supreme
advantage
and
*NL*
could
afford
to
be
kind
to
a
man
who
had
lost
everything
.
It
was
true
*NL*
that
Goodwood
had
at
times
grimly
wished
he
were
dead
and
would
have
*NL*
liked
to
kill
him
;
but
Osmond
had
no
means
of
knowing
this
,
for
practice
*NL*
had
made
the
younger
man
perfect
in
the
art
of
appearing
inaccessible
*NL*
to-day
to
any
violent
emotion
.
He
cultivated
this
art
in
order
to
*NL*
deceive
himself
,
but
it
was
others
that
he
deceived
first
.
He
cultivated
*NL*
it
,
moreover
,
with
very
limited
success
;
of
which
there
could
be
no
*NL*
better
proof
than
the
deep
,
dumb
irritation
that
reigned
in
his
*NL*
soul
when
he
heard
Osmond
speak
of
his
wife
's
feelings
as
if
he
were
*NL*
commissioned
to
answer
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
all
he
had
had
an
ear
for
in
what
his
host
said
to
him
this
*NL*
evening
;
he
had
been
conscious
that
Osmond
made
more
of
a
point
even
*NL*
than
usual
of
referring
to
the
conjugal
harmony
prevailing
at
Palazzo
*NL*
Roccanera
.
He
had
been
more
careful
than
ever
to
speak
as
if
he
and
his
*NL*
wife
had
all
things
in
sweet
community
and
it
were
as
natural
to
each
*NL*
of
them
to
say
``
we
''
as
to
say
``
I
''
.
In
all
this
there
was
an
air
of
*NL*
intention
that
had
puzzled
and
angered
our
poor
Bostonian
,
who
could
*NL*
only
reflect
for
his
comfort
that
Mrs.
Osmond
's
relations
with
her
*NL*
husband
were
none
of
his
business
.
He
had
no
proof
whatever
that
her
*NL*
husband
misrepresented
her
,
and
if
he
judged
her
by
the
surface
of
*NL*
things
was
bound
to
believe
that
she
liked
her
life
.
She
had
never
given
*NL*
him
the
faintest
sign
of
discontent
.
Miss
Stackpole
had
told
him
that
*NL*
she
had
lost
her
illusions
,
but
writing
for
the
papers
had
made
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
sensational
.
She
was
too
fond
of
early
news
.
Moreover
,
since
*NL*
her
arrival
in
Rome
she
had
been
much
on
her
guard
;
she
had
pretty
well
*NL*
ceased
to
flash
her
lantern
at
him
.
This
indeed
,
it
may
be
said
for
*NL*
her
,
would
have
been
quite
against
her
conscience
.
She
had
now
seen
*NL*
the
reality
of
Isabel
's
situation
,
and
it
had
inspired
her
with
a
just
*NL*
reserve
.
Whatever
could
be
done
to
improve
it
the
most
useful
form
of
*NL*
assistance
would
not
be
to
inflame
her
former
lovers
with
a
sense
of
her
*NL*
wrongs
.
Miss
Stackpole
continued
to
take
a
deep
interest
in
the
state
*NL*
of
Mr.
Goodwood
's
feelings
,
but
she
showed
it
at
present
only
by
sending
*NL*
him
choice
extracts
,
humorous
and
other
,
from
the
American
journals
,
of
*NL*
which
she
received
several
by
every
post
and
which
she
always
perused
*NL*
with
a
pair
of
scissors
in
her
hand
.
The
articles
she
cut
out
she
placed
*NL*
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
Mr.
Goodwood
,
which
she
left
with
her
own
*NL*
hand
at
his
hotel
.
He
never
asked
her
a
question
about
Isabel
:
had
n't
*NL*
he
come
five
thousand
miles
to
see
for
himself
?
He
was
thus
not
in
the
*NL*
least
authorised
to
think
Mrs.
Osmond
unhappy
;
but
the
very
absence
of
*NL*
authorisation
operated
as
an
irritant
,
ministered
to
the
harsh-ness
*NL*
with
which
,
in
spite
of
his
theory
that
he
had
ceased
to
care
,
he
now
*NL*
recognised
that
,
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
,
the
future
had
nothing
*NL*
more
for
him
.
He
had
not
even
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
the
truth
;
*NL*
apparently
he
could
not
even
be
trusted
to
respect
her
if
she
WERE
*NL*
unhappy
.
He
was
hopeless
,
helpless
,
useless
.
To
this
last
character
*NL*
she
had
called
his
attention
by
her
ingenious
plan
for
making
him
*NL*
leave
Rome
.
He
had
no
objection
whatever
to
doing
what
he
could
for
*NL*
her
cousin
,
but
it
made
him
grind
his
teeth
to
think
that
of
all
the
*NL*
services
she
might
have
asked
of
him
this
was
the
one
she
had
been
eager
*NL*
to
select
.
There
had
been
no
danger
of
her
choosing
one
that
would
have
*NL*
kept
him
in
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-night
what
he
was
chiefly
thinking
of
was
that
he
was
to
leave
her
*NL*
to-morrow
and
that
he
had
gained
nothing
by
coming
but
the
knowledge
*NL*
that
he
was
as
little
wanted
as
ever
.
About
herself
he
had
gained
no
*NL*
knowledge
;
she
was
imperturbable
,
inscrutable
,
impenetrable
.
He
felt
the
*NL*
old
bitterness
,
which
he
had
tried
so
hard
to
swallow
,
rise
again
in
his
*NL*
throat
,
and
he
knew
there
are
disappointments
that
last
as
long
as
life
.
*NL*
Osmond
went
on
talking
;
Goodwood
was
vaguely
aware
that
he
was
touching
*NL*
again
upon
his
perfect
intimacy
with
his
wife
.
It
seemed
to
him
for
a
*NL*
moment
that
the
man
had
a
kind
of
demonic
imagination
;
it
was
impossible
*NL*
that
without
malice
he
should
have
selected
so
unusual
a
topic
.
But
what
*NL*
did
it
matter
,
after
all
,
whether
he
were
demonic
or
not
,
and
whether
*NL*
she
loved
him
or
hated
him
?
She
might
hate
him
to
the
death
without
*NL*
one
's
gaining
a
straw
one
's
self
.
``
You
travel
,
by
the
by
,
with
Ralph
*NL*
Touchett
,
''
Osmond
said
.
``
I
suppose
that
means
you
'll
move
slowly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
shall
do
just
as
he
likes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
accommodating
.
We
're
immensely
obliged
to
you
;
you
must
*NL*
really
let
me
say
it
.
My
wife
has
probably
expressed
to
you
what
we
*NL*
feel
.
Touchett
has
been
on
our
minds
all
winter
;
it
has
looked
more
than
*NL*
once
as
if
he
would
never
leave
Rome
.
He
ought
never
to
have
come
;
it
's
*NL*
worse
than
an
imprudence
for
people
in
that
state
to
travel
;
it
's
a
kind
*NL*
of
indelicacy
.
I
would
n't
for
the
world
be
under
such
an
obligation
to
*NL*
Touchett
as
he
has
been
to
--
to
my
wife
and
me
.
Other
people
inevitably
*NL*
have
to
look
after
him
,
and
every
one
is
n't
so
generous
as
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
nothing
else
to
do
,
''
Caspar
said
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
looked
at
him
a
moment
askance
.
``
You
ought
to
marry
,
and
then
*NL*
you
'd
have
plenty
to
do
!
It
's
true
that
in
that
case
you
would
n't
be
*NL*
quite
so
available
for
deeds
of
mercy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
find
that
as
a
married
man
you
're
so
much
occupied
?
''
the
young
*NL*
man
mechanically
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
see
,
being
married
's
in
itself
an
occupation
.
It
is
n't
always
*NL*
active
;
it
's
often
passive
;
but
that
takes
even
more
attention
.
Then
my
*NL*
wife
and
I
do
so
many
things
together
.
We
read
,
we
study
,
we
make
music
,
*NL*
we
walk
,
we
drive
--
we
talk
even
,
as
when
we
first
knew
each
other
.
I
*NL*
delight
,
to
this
hour
,
in
my
wife
's
conversation
.
If
you
're
ever
bored
*NL*
take
my
advice
and
get
married
.
Your
wife
indeed
may
bore
you
,
in
that
*NL*
case
;
but
you
'll
never
bore
yourself
.
You
'll
always
have
something
to
*NL*
say
to
yourself
--
always
have
a
subject
of
reflection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
bored
,
''
said
Goodwood
.
``
I
've
plenty
to
think
about
and
to
say
*NL*
to
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
to
say
to
others
!
''
Osmond
exclaimed
with
a
light
laugh
.
*NL*
``
Where
shall
you
go
next
?
I
mean
after
you
've
consigned
Touchett
to
his
*NL*
natural
caretakers
--
I
believe
his
mother
's
at
last
coming
back
to
look
*NL*
after
him
.
That
little
lady
's
superb
;
she
neglects
her
duties
with
a
*NL*
finish
--
!
Perhaps
you
'll
spend
the
summer
in
England
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
've
no
plans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
man
!
That
's
a
little
bleak
,
but
it
's
very
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
'm
very
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Free
to
come
back
to
Rome
I
hope
,
''
said
Osmond
as
he
saw
a
group
of
*NL*
new
visitors
enter
the
room
.
``
Remember
that
when
you
do
come
we
count
on
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Goodwood
had
meant
to
go
away
early
,
but
the
evening
elapsed
without
*NL*
his
having
a
chance
to
speak
to
Isabel
otherwise
than
as
one
of
several
*NL*
associated
interlocutors
.
There
was
something
perverse
in
the
inveteracy
*NL*
with
which
she
avoided
him
;
his
unquenchable
rancour
discovered
an
*NL*
intention
where
there
was
certainly
no
appearance
of
one
.
There
was
*NL*
absolutely
no
appearance
of
one
.
She
met
his
eyes
with
her
clear
*NL*
hospitable
smile
,
which
seemed
almost
to
ask
that
he
would
come
and
help
*NL*
her
to
entertain
some
of
her
visitors
.
To
such
suggestions
,
however
,
he
*NL*
opposed
but
a
stiff
impatience
.
He
wandered
about
and
waited
;
he
talked
*NL*
to
the
few
people
he
knew
,
who
found
him
for
the
first
time
rather
*NL*
self-contradictory
.
This
was
indeed
rare
with
Caspar
Goodwood
,
though
he
*NL*
often
contradicted
others
.
There
was
often
music
at
Palazzo
Roccanera
,
*NL*
and
it
was
usually
very
good
.
Under
cover
of
the
music
he
managed
to
*NL*
contain
himself
;
but
toward
the
end
,
when
he
saw
the
people
beginning
to
*NL*
go
,
he
drew
near
to
Isabel
and
asked
her
in
a
low
tone
if
he
might
*NL*
not
speak
to
her
in
one
of
the
other
rooms
,
which
he
had
just
assured
*NL*
himself
was
empty
.
She
smiled
as
if
she
wished
to
oblige
him
but
found
*NL*
her
self
absolutely
prevented
.
``
I
'm
afraid
it
's
impossible
.
People
are
*NL*
saying
good-night
,
and
I
must
be
where
they
can
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
wait
till
they
are
all
gone
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
a
moment
.
``
Ah
,
that
will
be
delightful
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
waited
,
though
it
took
a
long
time
yet
.
There
were
several
*NL*
people
,
at
the
end
,
who
seemed
tethered
to
the
carpet
.
The
Countess
*NL*
Gemini
,
who
was
never
herself
till
midnight
,
as
she
said
,
displayed
no
*NL*
consciousness
that
the
entertainment
was
over
;
she
had
still
a
little
*NL*
circle
of
gentlemen
in
front
of
the
fire
,
who
every
now
and
then
broke
*NL*
into
a
united
laugh
.
Osmond
had
disappeared
--
he
never
bade
good-bye
to
*NL*
people
;
and
as
the
Countess
was
extending
her
range
,
according
to
her
*NL*
custom
at
this
period
of
the
evening
,
Isabel
had
sent
Pansy
to
bed
.
*NL*
Isabel
sat
a
little
apart
;
she
too
appeared
to
wish
her
sister-in-law
*NL*
would
sound
a
lower
note
and
let
the
last
loiterers
depart
in
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
not
say
a
word
to
you
now
?
''
Goodwood
presently
asked
her
.
She
*NL*
got
up
immediately
,
smiling
.
``
Certainly
,
we
'll
go
somewhere
else
if
you
*NL*
like
.
''
They
went
together
,
leaving
the
Countess
with
her
little
circle
,
*NL*
and
for
a
moment
after
they
had
crossed
the
threshold
neither
of
them
*NL*
spoke
.
Isabel
would
not
sit
down
;
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
*NL*
slowly
fanning
herself
;
she
had
for
him
the
same
familiar
grace
.
She
*NL*
seemed
to
wait
for
him
to
speak
.
Now
that
he
was
alone
with
her
all
the
*NL*
passion
he
had
never
stifled
surged
into
his
senses
;
it
hummed
in
his
*NL*
eyes
and
made
things
swim
round
him
.
The
bright
,
empty
room
grew
dim
and
*NL*
blurred
,
and
through
the
heaving
veil
he
felt
her
hover
before
him
with
*NL*
gleaming
eyes
and
parted
lips
.
If
he
had
seen
more
distinctly
he
would
*NL*
have
perceived
her
smile
was
fixed
and
a
trifle
forced
--
that
she
was
*NL*
frightened
at
what
she
saw
in
his
own
face
.
``
I
suppose
you
wish
to
bid
*NL*
me
goodbye
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
but
I
do
n't
like
it
.
I
do
n't
want
to
leave
Rome
,
''
he
answered
with
*NL*
almost
plaintive
honesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
well
imagine
.
It
's
wonderfully
good
of
you
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
*NL*
kind
I
think
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
more
he
said
nothing
.
``
With
a
few
words
like
that
you
make
*NL*
me
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
come
back
some
day
,
''
she
brightly
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
day
?
You
mean
as
long
a
time
hence
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
;
I
do
n't
mean
all
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
I
do
n't
understand
!
But
I
said
I
'd
go
,
and
I
'll
go
,
''
*NL*
Goodwood
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
back
whenever
you
like
,
''
said
Isabel
with
attempted
lightness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
a
straw
for
your
cousin
!
''
Caspar
broke
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
you
wished
to
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
I
did
n't
want
to
tell
you
anything
;
I
wanted
to
ask
you
--
''
he
*NL*
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
--
``
what
have
you
really
made
of
your
life
?
''
he
*NL*
said
,
in
a
low
,
quick
tone
.
He
paused
again
,
as
if
for
an
answer
;
but
*NL*
she
said
nothing
,
and
he
went
on
:
``
I
ca
n't
understand
,
I
ca
n't
penetrate
*NL*
you
!
What
am
I
to
believe
--
what
do
you
want
me
to
think
?
''
Still
she
said
*NL*
nothing
;
she
only
stood
looking
at
him
,
now
quite
without
pretending
to
*NL*
ease
.
``
I
'm
told
you
're
unhappy
,
and
if
you
are
I
should
like
to
know
it
.
*NL*
That
would
be
something
for
me
.
But
you
yourself
say
you
're
happy
,
and
*NL*
you
're
somehow
so
still
,
so
smooth
,
so
hard
.
You
're
completely
changed
.
*NL*
You
conceal
everything
;
I
have
n't
really
come
near
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
very
near
,
''
Isabel
said
gently
,
but
in
a
tone
of
warning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
do
n't
touch
you
!
I
want
to
know
the
truth
.
Have
you
done
*NL*
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ask
a
great
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
've
always
asked
a
great
deal
.
Of
course
you
wo
n't
tell
me
.
I
*NL*
shall
never
know
if
you
can
help
it
.
And
then
it
's
none
of
my
business
.
''
*NL*
He
had
spoken
with
a
visible
effort
to
control
himself
,
to
give
a
*NL*
considerate
form
to
an
inconsiderate
state
of
mind
.
But
the
sense
that
*NL*
it
was
his
last
chance
,
that
he
loved
her
and
had
lost
her
,
that
she
*NL*
would
think
him
a
fool
whatever
he
should
say
,
suddenly
gave
him
a
*NL*
lash
and
added
a
deep
vibration
to
his
low
voice
.
``
You
're
perfectly
*NL*
inscrutable
,
and
that
's
what
makes
me
think
you
've
something
to
hide
.
I
*NL*
tell
you
I
do
n't
care
a
straw
for
your
cousin
,
but
I
do
n't
mean
that
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
him
.
I
mean
that
it
is
n't
because
I
like
him
that
I
go
away
*NL*
with
him
.
I
'd
go
if
he
were
an
idiot
and
you
should
have
asked
me
.
If
*NL*
you
should
ask
me
I
'd
go
to
Siberia
tomorrow
.
Why
do
you
want
me
to
*NL*
leave
the
place
?
You
must
have
some
reason
for
that
;
if
you
were
as
*NL*
contented
as
you
pretend
you
are
you
would
n't
care
.
I
'd
rather
know
the
*NL*
truth
about
you
,
even
if
it
's
damnable
,
than
have
come
here
for
nothing
.
*NL*
That
is
n't
what
I
came
for
.
I
thought
I
should
n't
care
.
I
came
because
I
*NL*
wanted
to
assure
myself
that
I
need
n't
think
of
you
any
more
.
I
have
n't
*NL*
thought
of
anything
else
,
and
you
're
quite
right
to
wish
me
to
go
away
.
*NL*
But
if
I
must
go
,
there
's
no
harm
in
my
letting
myself
out
for
a
single
*NL*
moment
,
is
there
?
If
you
're
really
hurt
--
if
HE
hurts
you
--
nothing
I
say
*NL*
will
hurt
you
.
When
I
tell
you
I
love
you
it
's
simply
what
I
came
for
.
I
*NL*
thought
it
was
for
something
else
;
but
it
was
for
that
.
I
should
n't
*NL*
say
it
if
I
did
n't
believe
I
should
never
see
you
again
.
It
's
the
last
*NL*
time
--
let
me
pluck
a
single
flower
!
I
've
no
right
to
say
that
,
I
know
;
*NL*
and
you
've
no
right
to
listen
.
But
you
do
n't
listen
;
you
never
listen
,
*NL*
you
're
always
thinking
of
something
else
.
After
this
I
must
go
,
of
*NL*
course
;
so
I
shall
at
least
have
a
reason
.
Your
asking
me
is
no
reason
,
*NL*
not
a
real
one
.
I
ca
n't
judge
by
your
husband
,
''
he
went
on
irrelevantly
,
*NL*
almost
incoherently
;
``
I
do
n't
understand
him
;
he
tells
me
you
adore
each
*NL*
other
.
Why
does
he
tell
me
that
?
What
business
is
it
of
mine
?
When
I
say
*NL*
that
to
you
,
you
look
strange
.
But
you
always
look
strange
.
Yes
,
you
've
*NL*
something
to
hide
.
It
's
none
of
my
business
--
very
true
.
But
I
love
you
,
''
*NL*
said
Caspar
Goodwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
,
she
looked
strange
.
She
turned
her
eyes
to
the
door
by
which
*NL*
they
had
entered
and
raised
her
fan
as
if
in
warning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
behaved
so
well
;
do
n't
spoil
it
,
''
she
uttered
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
hears
me
.
It
's
wonderful
what
you
tried
to
put
me
off
with
.
I
*NL*
love
you
as
I
've
never
loved
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
.
I
knew
it
as
soon
as
you
consented
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
help
it
--
of
course
not
.
You
would
if
you
could
,
but
*NL*
you
ca
n't
,
unfortunately
.
Unfortunately
for
me
,
I
mean
.
I
ask
*NL*
nothing
--
nothing
,
that
is
,
I
should
n't
.
But
I
do
ask
one
sole
*NL*
satisfaction
:
--
that
you
tell
me
--
that
you
tell
me
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
tell
you
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
I
may
pity
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
like
that
?
''
Isabel
asked
,
trying
to
smile
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
pity
you
?
Most
assuredly
!
That
at
least
would
be
doing
something
.
*NL*
I
'd
give
my
life
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
fan
to
her
face
,
which
it
covered
all
except
her
eyes
.
*NL*
They
rested
a
moment
on
his
.
``
Do
n't
give
your
life
to
it
;
but
give
a
*NL*
thought
to
it
every
now
and
then
.
''
And
with
that
she
went
back
to
the
*NL*
Countess
Gemini
.

CHAPTER
XLIX
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
had
not
made
her
appearance
at
Palazzo
Roccanera
on
the
*NL*
evening
of
that
Thursday
of
which
I
have
narrated
some
of
the
incidents
,
*NL*
and
Isabel
,
though
she
observed
her
absence
,
was
not
surprised
by
it
.
*NL*
Things
had
passed
between
them
which
added
no
stimulus
to
sociability
,
*NL*
and
to
appreciate
which
we
must
glance
a
little
backward
.
It
has
been
*NL*
mentioned
that
Madame
Merle
returned
from
Naples
shortly
after
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
had
left
Rome
,
and
that
on
her
first
meeting
with
Isabel
*NL*
-LRB-
whom
,
to
do
her
justice
,
she
came
immediately
to
see
-RRB-
her
first
*NL*
utterance
had
been
an
enquiry
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
this
nobleman
,
*NL*
for
whom
she
appeared
to
hold
her
dear
friend
accountable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
talk
of
him
,
''
said
Isabel
for
answer
;
``
we
've
heard
so
much
*NL*
of
him
of
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
bent
her
head
on
one
side
a
little
,
protestingly
,
and
*NL*
smiled
at
the
left
corner
of
her
mouth
.
``
You
've
heard
,
yes
.
But
you
must
*NL*
remember
that
I
've
not
,
in
Naples
.
I
hoped
to
find
him
here
and
to
be
*NL*
able
to
congratulate
Pansy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
congratulate
Pansy
still
;
but
not
on
marrying
Lord
Warburton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you
say
that
!
Do
n't
you
know
I
had
set
my
heart
on
it
?
''
Madame
*NL*
Merle
asked
with
a
great
deal
of
spirit
,
but
still
with
the
intonation
*NL*
of
good-humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
was
discomposed
,
but
she
was
determined
to
be
good-humoured
too
.
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
have
gone
to
Naples
then
.
You
should
have
stayed
here
to
*NL*
watch
the
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
too
much
confidence
in
you
.
But
do
you
think
it
's
too
late
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
ask
Pansy
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
ask
her
what
you
've
said
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
seemed
to
justify
the
impulse
of
self-defence
aroused
*NL*
on
Isabel
's
part
by
her
perceiving
that
her
visitor
's
attitude
was
a
*NL*
critical
one
.
Madame
Merle
,
as
we
know
,
had
been
very
discreet
hitherto
;
*NL*
she
had
never
criticised
;
she
had
been
markedly
afraid
of
intermeddling
.
*NL*
But
apparently
she
had
only
reserved
herself
for
this
occasion
,
since
*NL*
she
now
had
a
dangerous
quickness
in
her
eye
and
an
air
of
irritation
*NL*
which
even
her
admirable
ease
was
not
able
to
transmute
.
She
had
*NL*
suffered
a
disappointment
which
excited
Isabel
's
surprise
--
our
heroine
*NL*
having
no
knowledge
of
her
zealous
interest
in
Pansy
's
marriage
;
and
*NL*
she
betrayed
it
in
a
manner
which
quickened
Mrs.
Osmond
's
alarm
.
More
*NL*
clearly
than
ever
before
Isabel
heard
a
cold
,
mocking
voice
proceed
from
*NL*
she
knew
not
where
,
in
the
dim
void
that
surrounded
her
,
and
declare
*NL*
that
this
bright
,
strong
,
definite
,
worldly
woman
,
this
incarnation
of
*NL*
the
practical
,
the
personal
,
the
immediate
,
was
a
powerful
agent
in
her
*NL*
destiny
.
She
was
nearer
to
her
than
Isabel
had
yet
discovered
,
and
her
*NL*
nearness
was
not
the
charming
accident
she
had
so
long
supposed
.
The
*NL*
sense
of
accident
indeed
had
died
within
her
that
day
when
she
happened
*NL*
to
be
struck
with
the
manner
in
which
the
wonderful
lady
and
her
own
*NL*
husband
sat
together
in
private
.
No
definite
suspicion
had
as
yet
*NL*
taken
its
place
;
but
it
was
enough
to
make
her
view
this
friend
with
a
*NL*
different
eye
,
to
have
been
led
to
reflect
that
there
was
more
intention
*NL*
in
her
past
behaviour
than
she
had
allowed
for
at
the
time
.
Ah
yes
,
*NL*
there
had
been
intention
,
there
had
been
intention
,
Isabel
said
to
*NL*
herself
;
and
she
seemed
to
wake
from
a
long
pernicious
dream
.
What
was
*NL*
it
that
brought
home
to
her
that
Madame
Merle
's
intention
had
not
been
*NL*
good
?
Nothing
but
the
mistrust
which
had
lately
taken
body
and
which
*NL*
married
itself
now
to
the
fruitful
wonder
produced
by
her
visitor
's
*NL*
challenge
on
behalf
of
poor
Pansy
.
There
was
something
in
this
challenge
*NL*
which
had
at
the
very
outset
excited
an
answering
defiance
;
a
nameless
*NL*
vitality
which
she
could
see
to
have
been
absent
from
her
friend
's
*NL*
professions
of
delicacy
and
caution
.
Madame
Merle
had
been
unwilling
to
*NL*
interfere
,
certainly
,
but
only
so
long
as
there
was
nothing
to
interfere
*NL*
with
.
It
will
perhaps
seem
to
the
reader
that
Isabel
went
fast
in
*NL*
casting
doubt
,
on
mere
suspicion
,
on
a
sincerity
proved
by
several
*NL*
years
of
good
offices
.
She
moved
quickly
indeed
,
and
with
reason
,
for
a
*NL*
strange
truth
was
filtering
into
her
soul
.
Madame
Merle
's
interest
was
*NL*
identical
with
Osmond
's
:
that
was
enough
.
``
I
think
Pansy
will
tell
*NL*
you
nothing
that
will
make
you
more
angry
,
''
she
said
in
answer
to
her
*NL*
companion
's
last
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
in
the
least
angry
.
I
've
only
a
great
desire
to
retrieve
the
*NL*
situation
.
Do
you
consider
that
Warburton
has
left
us
for
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
;
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
It
's
all
over
;
please
let
it
*NL*
rest
.
Osmond
has
talked
to
me
a
great
deal
about
it
,
and
I
've
nothing
*NL*
more
to
say
or
to
hear
.
I
've
no
doubt
,
''
Isabel
added
,
``
that
he
'll
be
*NL*
very
happy
to
discuss
the
subject
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
he
thinks
;
he
came
to
see
me
last
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
you
had
arrived
?
Then
you
know
all
about
it
and
you
need
n't
*NL*
apply
to
me
for
information
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
information
I
want
.
At
bottom
it
's
sympathy
.
I
had
set
my
*NL*
heart
on
that
marriage
;
the
idea
did
what
so
few
things
do
--
it
satisfied
*NL*
the
imagination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
imagination
,
yes
.
But
not
that
of
the
persons
concerned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
by
that
of
course
that
I
'm
not
concerned
.
Of
course
not
*NL*
directly
.
But
when
one
's
such
an
old
friend
one
ca
n't
help
having
*NL*
something
at
stake
.
You
forget
how
long
I
've
known
Pansy
.
You
mean
,
*NL*
of
course
,
''
Madame
Merle
added
,
``
that
YOU
are
one
of
the
persons
*NL*
concerned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
that
's
the
last
thing
I
mean
.
I
'm
very
weary
of
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
hesitated
a
little
.
``
Ah
yes
,
your
work
's
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
what
you
say
,
''
said
Isabel
very
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
take
care
;
never
perhaps
more
than
when
it
appears
least
.
Your
*NL*
husband
judges
you
severely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
made
for
a
moment
no
answer
to
this
;
she
felt
choked
with
*NL*
bitterness
.
It
was
not
the
insolence
of
Madame
Merle
's
informing
her
*NL*
that
Osmond
had
been
taking
her
into
his
confidence
as
against
his
wife
*NL*
that
struck
her
most
;
for
she
was
not
quick
to
believe
that
this
was
*NL*
meant
for
insolence
.
Madame
Merle
was
very
rarely
insolent
,
and
only
*NL*
when
it
was
exactly
right
.
It
was
not
right
now
,
or
at
least
it
was
not
*NL*
right
yet
.
What
touched
Isabel
like
a
drop
of
corrosive
acid
upon
an
*NL*
open
wound
was
the
knowledge
that
Osmond
dishonoured
her
in
his
words
as
*NL*
well
as
in
his
thoughts
.
``
Should
you
like
to
know
how
I
judge
HIM
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
because
you
'd
never
tell
me
.
And
it
would
be
painful
for
me
to
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
,
and
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
known
her
Isabel
*NL*
thought
Madame
Merle
disagreeable
.
She
wished
she
would
leave
her
.
*NL*
``
Remember
how
attractive
Pansy
is
,
and
do
n't
despair
,
''
she
said
*NL*
abruptly
,
with
a
desire
that
this
should
close
their
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Madame
Merle
's
expansive
presence
underwent
no
contraction
.
She
only
*NL*
gathered
her
mantle
about
her
and
,
with
the
movement
,
scattered
upon
the
*NL*
air
a
faint
,
agreeable
fragrance
.
``
I
do
n't
despair
;
I
feel
encouraged
.
*NL*
And
I
did
n't
come
to
scold
you
;
I
came
if
possible
to
learn
the
truth
.
I
*NL*
know
you
'll
tell
it
if
I
ask
you
.
It
's
an
immense
blessing
with
you
that
*NL*
one
can
count
upon
that
.
No
,
you
wo
n't
believe
what
a
comfort
I
take
in
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
truth
do
you
speak
of
?
''
Isabel
asked
,
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
this
:
whether
Lord
Warburton
changed
his
mind
quite
of
his
own
*NL*
movement
or
because
you
recommended
it
.
To
please
himself
I
mean
,
or
to
*NL*
please
you
.
Think
of
the
confidence
I
must
still
have
in
you
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
having
lost
a
little
of
it
,
''
Madame
Merle
continued
with
a
smile
,
``
to
*NL*
ask
such
a
question
as
that
!
''
She
sat
looking
at
her
friend
,
to
judge
*NL*
the
effect
of
her
words
,
and
then
went
on
:
``
Now
do
n't
be
heroic
,
do
n't
*NL*
be
unreasonable
,
do
n't
take
offence
.
It
seems
to
me
I
do
you
an
honour
*NL*
in
speaking
so
.
I
do
n't
know
another
woman
to
whom
I
would
do
it
.
I
*NL*
have
n't
the
least
idea
that
any
other
woman
would
tell
me
the
truth
.
And
*NL*
do
n't
you
see
how
well
it
is
that
your
husband
should
know
it
?
It
's
*NL*
true
that
he
does
n't
appear
to
have
had
any
tact
whatever
in
trying
to
*NL*
extract
it
;
he
has
indulged
in
gratuitous
suppositions
.
But
that
does
n't
*NL*
alter
the
fact
that
it
would
make
a
difference
in
his
view
of
his
*NL*
daughter
's
prospects
to
know
distinctly
what
really
occurred
.
If
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
simply
got
tired
of
the
poor
child
,
that
's
one
thing
,
and
it
's
*NL*
a
pity
.
If
he
gave
her
up
to
please
you
it
's
another
.
That
's
a
pity
too
,
*NL*
but
in
a
different
way
.
Then
,
in
the
latter
case
,
you
'd
perhaps
resign
*NL*
yourself
to
not
being
pleased
--
to
simply
seeing
your
step-daughter
*NL*
married
.
Let
him
off
--
let
us
have
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
had
proceeded
very
deliberately
,
watching
her
companion
and
*NL*
apparently
thinking
she
could
proceed
safely
.
As
she
went
on
Isabel
grew
*NL*
pale
;
she
clasped
her
hands
more
tightly
in
her
lap
.
It
was
not
that
her
*NL*
visitor
had
at
last
thought
it
the
right
time
to
be
insolent
;
for
this
*NL*
was
not
what
was
most
apparent
.
It
was
a
worse
horror
than
that
.
``
Who
*NL*
are
you
--
what
are
you
?
''
Isabel
murmured
.
``
What
have
you
to
do
with
my
*NL*
husband
?
''
It
was
strange
that
for
the
moment
she
drew
as
near
to
him
as
*NL*
if
she
had
loved
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
,
you
take
it
heroically
!
I
'm
very
sorry
.
Do
n't
think
,
however
,
*NL*
that
I
shall
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
to
do
with
me
?
''
Isabel
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
slowly
got
up
,
stroking
her
muff
,
but
not
removing
her
eyes
*NL*
from
Isabel
's
face
.
``
Everything
!
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
sat
there
looking
up
at
her
,
without
rising
;
her
face
was
almost
*NL*
a
prayer
to
be
enlightened
.
But
the
light
of
this
woman
's
eyes
seemed
*NL*
only
a
darkness
.
``
Oh
misery
!
''
she
murmured
at
last
;
and
she
fell
*NL*
back
,
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
.
It
had
come
over
her
like
a
*NL*
high-surging
wave
that
Mrs.
Touchett
was
right
.
Madame
Merle
had
married
*NL*
her
.
Before
she
uncovered
her
face
again
that
lady
had
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
took
a
drive
alone
that
afternoon
;
she
wished
to
be
far
away
,
*NL*
under
the
sky
,
where
she
could
descend
from
her
carriage
and
tread
*NL*
upon
the
daisies
.
She
had
long
before
this
taken
old
Rome
into
her
*NL*
confidence
,
for
in
a
world
of
ruins
the
ruin
of
her
happiness
seemed
a
*NL*
less
unnatural
catastrophe
.
She
rested
her
weariness
upon
things
that
*NL*
had
crumbled
for
centuries
and
yet
still
were
upright
;
she
dropped
her
*NL*
secret
sadness
into
the
silence
of
lonely
places
,
where
its
very
modern
*NL*
quality
detached
itself
and
grew
objective
,
so
that
as
she
sat
in
a
*NL*
sun-warmed
angle
on
a
winter
's
day
,
or
stood
in
a
mouldy
church
to
which
*NL*
no
one
came
,
she
could
almost
smile
at
it
and
think
of
its
smallness
.
*NL*
Small
it
was
,
in
the
large
Roman
record
,
and
her
haunting
sense
of
the
*NL*
continuity
of
the
human
lot
easily
carried
her
from
the
less
to
the
*NL*
greater
.
She
had
become
deeply
,
tenderly
acquainted
with
Rome
;
it
*NL*
interfused
and
moderated
her
passion
.
But
she
had
grown
to
think
of
it
*NL*
chiefly
as
the
place
where
people
had
suffered
.
This
was
what
came
to
*NL*
her
in
the
starved
churches
,
where
the
marble
columns
,
transferred
from
*NL*
pagan
ruins
,
seemed
to
offer
her
a
companionship
in
endurance
and
the
*NL*
musty
incense
to
be
a
compound
of
long-unanswered
prayers
.
There
was
*NL*
no
gentler
nor
less
consistent
heretic
than
Isabel
;
the
firmest
of
*NL*
worshippers
,
gazing
at
dark
altar-pictures
or
clustered
candles
,
could
*NL*
not
have
felt
more
intimately
the
suggestiveness
of
these
objects
nor
*NL*
have
been
more
liable
at
such
moments
to
a
spiritual
visitation
.
Pansy
,
*NL*
as
we
know
,
was
almost
always
her
companion
,
and
of
late
the
Countess
*NL*
Gemini
,
balancing
a
pink
parasol
,
had
lent
brilliancy
to
their
equipage
;
*NL*
but
she
still
occasionally
found
herself
alone
when
it
suited
her
*NL*
mood
and
where
it
suited
the
place
.
On
such
occasions
she
had
several
*NL*
resorts
;
the
most
accessible
of
which
perhaps
was
a
seat
on
the
low
*NL*
parapet
which
edges
the
wide
grassy
space
before
the
high
,
cold
front
*NL*
of
Saint
John
Lateran
,
whence
you
look
across
the
Campagna
at
the
*NL*
far-trailing
outline
of
the
Alban
Mount
and
at
that
mighty
plain
,
*NL*
between
,
which
is
still
so
full
of
all
that
has
passed
from
it
.
After
*NL*
the
departure
of
her
cousin
and
his
companions
she
roamed
more
than
*NL*
usual
;
she
carried
her
sombre
spirit
from
one
familiar
shrine
to
the
*NL*
other
.
Even
when
Pansy
and
the
Countess
were
with
her
she
felt
the
touch
*NL*
of
a
vanished
world
.
The
carriage
,
leaving
the
walls
of
Rome
behind
,
*NL*
rolled
through
narrow
lanes
where
the
wild
honeysuckle
had
begun
to
*NL*
tangle
itself
in
the
hedges
,
or
waited
for
her
in
quiet
places
where
*NL*
the
fields
lay
near
,
while
she
strolled
further
and
further
over
the
*NL*
flower-freckled
turf
,
or
sat
on
a
stone
that
had
once
had
a
use
and
*NL*
gazed
through
the
veil
of
her
personal
sadness
at
the
splendid
sadness
*NL*
of
the
scene
--
at
the
dense
,
warm
light
,
the
far
gradations
and
soft
*NL*
confusions
of
colour
,
the
motionless
shepherds
in
lonely
attitudes
,
the
*NL*
hills
where
the
cloud-shadows
had
the
lightness
of
a
blush
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
afternoon
I
began
with
speaking
of
,
she
had
taken
a
resolution
*NL*
not
to
think
of
Madame
Merle
;
but
the
resolution
proved
vain
,
and
this
*NL*
lady
's
image
hovered
constantly
before
her
.
She
asked
herself
,
with
an
*NL*
almost
childlike
horror
of
the
supposition
,
whether
to
this
intimate
*NL*
friend
of
several
years
the
great
historical
epithet
of
wicked
were
*NL*
to
be
applied
.
She
knew
the
idea
only
by
the
Bible
and
other
literary
*NL*
works
;
to
the
best
of
her
belief
she
had
had
no
personal
acquaintance
*NL*
with
wickedness
.
She
had
desired
a
large
acquaintance
with
human
life
,
*NL*
and
in
spite
of
her
having
flattered
herself
that
she
cultivated
it
with
*NL*
some
success
this
elementary
privilege
had
been
denied
her
.
Perhaps
it
*NL*
was
not
wicked
--
in
the
historic
sense
--
to
be
even
deeply
false
;
for
that
*NL*
was
what
Madame
Merle
had
been
--
deeply
,
deeply
,
deeply
.
Isabel
's
Aunt
*NL*
Lydia
had
made
this
discovery
long
before
,
and
had
mentioned
it
to
her
*NL*
niece
;
but
Isabel
had
flattered
herself
at
this
time
that
she
had
a
much
*NL*
richer
view
of
things
,
especially
of
the
spontaneity
of
her
own
*NL*
career
and
the
nobleness
of
her
own
interpretations
,
than
poor
*NL*
stiffly-reasoning
Mrs.
Touchett
.
Madame
Merle
had
done
what
she
wanted
;
*NL*
she
had
brought
about
the
union
of
her
two
friends
;
a
reflection
which
*NL*
could
not
fail
to
make
it
a
matter
of
wonder
that
she
should
so
much
*NL*
have
desired
such
an
event
.
There
were
people
who
had
the
match-making
*NL*
passion
,
like
the
votaries
of
art
for
art
;
but
Madame
Merle
,
great
*NL*
artist
as
she
was
,
was
scarcely
one
of
these
.
She
thought
too
ill
of
*NL*
marriage
,
too
ill
even
of
life
;
she
had
desired
that
particular
marriage
*NL*
but
had
not
desired
others
.
She
had
therefore
had
a
conception
of
gain
,
*NL*
and
Isabel
asked
herself
where
she
had
found
her
profit
.
It
took
her
*NL*
naturally
a
long
time
to
discover
,
and
even
then
her
discovery
was
*NL*
imperfect
.
It
came
back
to
her
that
Madame
Merle
,
though
she
had
seemed
*NL*
to
like
her
from
their
first
meeting
at
Gardencourt
,
had
been
doubly
*NL*
affectionate
after
Mr.
Touchett
's
death
and
after
learning
that
her
*NL*
young
friend
had
been
subject
to
the
good
old
man
's
charity
.
She
had
*NL*
found
her
profit
not
in
the
gross
device
of
borrowing
money
,
but
in
*NL*
the
more
refined
idea
of
introducing
one
of
her
intimates
to
the
young
*NL*
woman
's
fresh
and
ingenuous
fortune
.
She
had
naturally
chosen
her
*NL*
closest
intimate
,
and
it
was
already
vivid
enough
to
Isabel
that
Gilbert
*NL*
occupied
this
position
.
She
found
herself
confronted
in
this
manner
with
*NL*
the
conviction
that
the
man
in
the
world
whom
she
had
supposed
to
be
the
*NL*
least
sordid
had
married
her
,
like
a
vulgar
adventurer
,
for
her
money
.
*NL*
Strange
to
say
,
it
had
never
before
occurred
to
her
;
if
she
had
thought
*NL*
a
good
deal
of
harm
of
Osmond
she
had
not
done
him
this
particular
*NL*
injury
.
This
was
the
worst
she
could
think
of
,
and
she
had
been
saying
*NL*
to
herself
that
the
worst
was
still
to
come
.
A
man
might
marry
a
woman
*NL*
for
her
money
perfectly
well
;
the
thing
was
often
done
.
But
at
least
*NL*
he
should
let
her
know
.
She
wondered
whether
,
since
he
had
wanted
her
*NL*
money
,
her
money
would
now
satisfy
him
.
Would
he
take
her
money
and
let
*NL*
her
go
Ah
,
if
Mr.
Touchett
's
great
charity
would
but
help
her
to-day
it
*NL*
would
be
blessed
indeed
!
It
was
not
slow
to
occur
to
her
that
if
Madame
*NL*
Merle
had
wished
to
do
Gilbert
a
service
his
recognition
to
her
of
the
*NL*
boon
must
have
lost
its
warmth
.
What
must
be
his
feelings
to-day
in
*NL*
regard
to
his
too
zealous
benefactress
,
and
what
expression
must
they
*NL*
have
found
on
the
part
of
such
a
master
of
irony
?
It
is
a
singular
,
but
*NL*
a
characteristic
,
fact
that
before
Isabel
returned
from
her
silent
drive
*NL*
she
had
broken
its
silence
by
the
soft
exclamation
:
``
Poor
,
poor
Madame
*NL*
Merle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
compassion
would
perhaps
have
been
justified
if
on
this
same
*NL*
afternoon
she
had
been
concealed
behind
one
of
the
valuable
curtains
of
*NL*
time-softened
damask
which
dressed
the
interesting
little
salon
of
the
*NL*
lady
to
whom
it
referred
;
the
carefully-arranged
apartment
to
which
*NL*
we
once
paid
a
visit
in
company
with
the
discreet
Mr.
Rosier
.
In
that
*NL*
apartment
,
towards
six
o'clock
,
Gilbert
Osmond
was
seated
,
and
his
*NL*
hostess
stood
before
him
as
Isabel
had
seen
her
stand
on
an
occasion
*NL*
commemorated
in
this
history
with
an
emphasis
appropriate
not
so
much
to
*NL*
its
apparent
as
to
its
real
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
you
're
unhappy
;
I
believe
you
like
it
,
''
said
Madame
*NL*
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
say
I
was
unhappy
?
''
Osmond
asked
with
a
face
grave
enough
to
*NL*
suggest
that
he
might
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
you
do
n't
say
the
contrary
,
as
you
ought
in
common
gratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
about
gratitude
,
''
he
returned
dryly
.
``
And
do
n't
aggravate
*NL*
me
,
''
he
added
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
slowly
seated
herself
,
with
her
arms
folded
and
her
white
*NL*
hands
arranged
as
a
support
to
one
of
them
and
an
ornament
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
to
the
other
.
She
looked
exquisitely
calm
but
impressively
sad
.
``
On
*NL*
your
side
,
do
n't
try
to
frighten
me
.
I
wonder
if
you
guess
some
of
my
*NL*
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trouble
about
them
no
more
than
I
can
help
.
I
've
quite
enough
of
my
*NL*
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
because
they
're
so
delightful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
rested
his
head
against
the
back
of
his
chair
and
looked
at
*NL*
his
companion
with
a
cynical
directness
which
seemed
also
partly
an
*NL*
expression
of
fatigue
.
``
You
do
aggravate
me
,
''
he
remarked
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
moi
donc
!
''
cried
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
you
it
's
because
you
fatigue
yourself
.
With
me
it
's
not
my
own
*NL*
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
fatigue
myself
it
's
for
you
.
I
've
given
you
an
interest
.
That
's
*NL*
a
great
gift
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
it
an
interest
?
''
Osmond
enquired
with
detachment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
since
it
helps
you
to
pass
your
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
has
never
seemed
longer
to
me
than
this
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
never
looked
better
;
you
've
never
been
so
agreeable
,
so
*NL*
brilliant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
my
brilliancy
!
''
he
thoughtfully
murmured
.
``
How
little
,
after
all
,
*NL*
you
know
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
do
n't
know
you
I
know
nothing
,
''
smiled
Madame
Merle
.
``
You
've
the
*NL*
feeling
of
complete
success
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
shall
not
have
that
till
I
've
made
you
stop
judging
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
that
long
ago

I
speak
from
old
knowledge

But
you
express
*NL*
yourself
more
too

*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
just
hung
fire
.
``
I
wish
you
'd
express
yourself
less
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wish
to
condemn
me
to
silence

Remember
that
I
've
never
been
a

chatterbox

At
any
rate
there
are
three
or
four
things
I
should
like
to
*NL*
say
to
you
first
.
Your
wife
does
n't
know
what
to
do
with
herself
,
''
she
*NL*
went
on
with
a
change
of
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
;
she
knows
perfectly
.
She
has
a
line
sharply
drawn

She
means
*NL*
to
carry
out
her
ideas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
ideas
to-day
must
be
remarkable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
they
are

She
has
more
of
them
than
ever

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
unable
to
show
me
any
this
morning

said
Madame
Merle
.
``
She
*NL*
seemed
in
a
very
simple
,
almost
in
a
stupid

state
of
mind

She
was
*NL*
completely
bewildered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
say
at
once
that
she
was
pathetic

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
no

do
n't

*NL*
He
still
had
his
head
against
the
cushion
behind
him
;
the
ankle
of
one
*NL*
foot
rested
on
the
other
knee
.
So
he
sat
for
a
while
.
``
I
should
like
to
*NL*
know
what
's
the
matter
with
you

he
said
at
last

The
matter
--
the
matter
--
!
''
And
here
Madame
Merle
stopped
.
Then
she
went
*NL*
on
with
a
sudden
outbreak
of
passion
,
a
burst
of
summer
thunder
in
a
*NL*
clear
sky
:
``
The
matter
is
that
I
would
give
my
right
hand
to
be
able
to
*NL*
weep
,
and
that
I
ca
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
good
would
it
do
you
to
weep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
make
me
feel
as
I
felt
before
I
knew
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
've
dried
your
tears
,
that
's
something
.
But
I
've
seen
you
shed
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
believe
you
'll
make
me
cry
still
.
I
mean
make
me
howl
like
a
*NL*
wolf
.
I
've
a
great
hope
,
I
've
a
great
need
,
of
that
.
I
was
vile
this
*NL*
morning
;
I
was
horrid
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Isabel
was
in
the
stupid
state
of
mind
you
mention
she
probably
*NL*
did
n't
perceive
it
,
''
Osmond
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
precisely
my
deviltry
that
stupefied
her
.
I
could
n't
help
it
;
I
*NL*
was
full
of
something
bad
.
Perhaps
it
was
something
good
;
I
do
n't
know
.
*NL*
You
've
not
only
dried
up
my
tears
;
you
've
dried
up
my
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
I
then
that
am
responsible
for
my
wife
's
condition
,
''
Osmond
*NL*
said
.
``
It
's
pleasant
to
think
that
I
shall
get
the
benefit
of
your
*NL*
influence
upon
her
.
Do
n't
you
know
the
soul
is
an
immortal
principle
?
*NL*
How
can
it
suffer
alteration
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
at
all
that
it
's
an
immortal
principle
.
I
believe
it
*NL*
can
perfectly
be
destroyed
.
That
's
what
has
happened
to
mine
,
which
*NL*
was
a
very
good
one
to
start
with
;
and
it
's
you
I
have
to
thank
for
it
.
*NL*
You
're
VERY
bad
,
''
she
added
with
gravity
in
her
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
the
way
we
're
to
end
?
''
Osmond
asked
with
the
same
studied
*NL*
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
we
're
to
end
.
I
wish
I
did
--
How
do
bad
people
*NL*
end
?
--
especially
as
to
their
COMMON
crimes
.
You
have
made
me
as
bad
as
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
You
seem
to
me
quite
good
enough
,
''
said
Osmond
,
*NL*
his
conscious
indifference
giving
an
extreme
effect
to
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
's
self-possession
tended
on
the
contrary
to
diminish
,
and
*NL*
she
was
nearer
losing
it
than
on
any
occasion
on
which
we
have
had
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
meeting
her
.
The
glow
of
her
eye
turners
sombre
;
her
smile
*NL*
betrayed
a
painful
effort
.
``
Good
enough
for
anything
that
I
've
done
with
*NL*
myself
?
I
suppose
that
's
what
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
enough
to
be
always
charming
!
''
Osmond
exclaimed
,
smiling
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
God
!
''
his
companion
murmured
;
and
,
sitting
there
in
her
ripe
*NL*
freshness
,
she
had
recourse
to
the
same
gesture
she
had
provoked
on
*NL*
Isabel
's
part
in
the
morning
:
she
bent
her
face
and
covered
it
with
her
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
weep
after
all
?
''
Osmond
asked
;
and
on
her
remaining
*NL*
motionless
he
went
on
:
``
Have
I
ever
complained
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
her
hands
quickly
.
``
No
,
you
've
taken
your
revenge
*NL*
otherwise
--
you
have
taken
it
on
HER
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
threw
back
his
head
further
;
he
looked
a
while
at
the
ceiling
*NL*
and
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
appealing
,
in
an
informal
way
,
to
the
*NL*
heavenly
powers
.
``
Oh
,
the
imagination
of
women
!
It
's
always
vulgar
,
at
*NL*
bottom
.
You
talk
of
revenge
like
a
third-rate
novelist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
have
n't
complained
.
You
've
enjoyed
your
triumph
too
*NL*
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
rather
curious
to
know
what
you
call
my
triumph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
made
your
wife
afraid
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
changed
his
position
;
he
leaned
forward
,
resting
his
elbows
on
*NL*
his
knees
and
looking
a
while
at
a
beautiful
old
Persian
rug
,
at
*NL*
his
feet
.
He
had
an
air
of
refusing
to
accept
any
one
's
valuation
*NL*
of
anything
,
even
of
time
,
and
of
preferring
to
abide
by
his
own
;
a
*NL*
peculiarity
which
made
him
at
moments
an
irritating
person
to
converse
*NL*
with
.
``
Isabel
's
not
afraid
of
me
,
and
it
's
not
what
I
wish
,
''
he
said
*NL*
at
last
.
``
To
what
do
you
want
to
provoke
me
when
you
say
such
things
as
*NL*
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
thought
over
all
the
harm
you
can
do
me
,
''
Madame
Merle
answered
.
*NL*
``
Your
wife
was
afraid
of
me
this
morning
,
but
in
me
it
was
really
you
*NL*
she
feared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
have
said
things
that
were
in
very
bad
taste
;
I
'm
not
*NL*
responsible
for
that
.
I
did
n't
see
the
use
of
your
going
to
see
her
at
*NL*
all
:
you
're
capable
of
acting
without
her
.
I
've
not
made
you
afraid
of
*NL*
me
that
I
can
see
,
''
he
went
on
;
``
how
then
should
I
have
made
her
?
You
're
*NL*
at
least
as
brave
.
I
ca
n't
think
where
you
've
picked
up
such
rubbish
;
*NL*
one
might
suppose
you
knew
me
by
this
time
.
''
He
got
up
as
he
spoke
and
*NL*
walked
to
the
chimney
,
where
he
stood
a
moment
bending
his
eye
,
as
if
*NL*
he
had
seen
them
for
the
first
time
,
on
the
delicate
specimens
of
rare
*NL*
porcelain
with
which
it
was
covered
.
He
took
up
a
small
cup
and
held
it
*NL*
in
his
hand
;
then
,
still
holding
it
and
leaning
his
arm
on
the
mantel
,
*NL*
he
pursued
:
``
You
always
see
too
much
in
everything
;
you
overdo
it
;
you
*NL*
lose
sight
of
the
real
.
I
'm
much
simpler
than
you
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
're
very
simple
.
''
And
Madame
Merle
kept
her
eye
on
her
cup
.
*NL*
``
I
've
come
to
that
with
time
.
I
judged
you
,
as
I
say
,
of
old
;
but
it
's
*NL*
only
since
your
marriage
that
I
've
understood
you
.
I
've
seen
better
what
*NL*
you
have
been
to
your
wife
than
I
ever
saw
what
you
were
for
me
.
Please
*NL*
be
very
careful
of
that
precious
object
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
already
has
a
wee
bit
of
a
tiny
crack
,
''
said
Osmond
dryly
as
he
put
*NL*
it
down
.
``
If
you
did
n't
understand
me
before
I
married
it
was
cruelly
*NL*
rash
of
you
to
put
me
into
such
a
box
.
However
,
I
took
a
fancy
to
my
box
*NL*
myself
;
I
thought
it
would
be
a
comfortable
fit
.
I
asked
very
little
;
I
*NL*
only
asked
that
she
should
like
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
she
should
like
you
so
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
,
of

in
such
a

one
asks
the
maximum

if
you
will

Oh
yes

I
wanted
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never

said
Madame

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

you
pretended

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
that
you
never
accused
me

comfortable
fit

Madame
*NL*
Merle
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wife
has
declined

declined
to
do
anything
of
the
sort

said
*NL*
Osmond
.
``
If
you
're
determined
to
make
a
tragedy
of
that

*NL*
hardly
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tragedy
's
for
me
!
''
Madame
Merle
exclaimed
,
rising
with
a
long
*NL*
low
sigh
but
having
a
glance
at
the
same
time
for
the
contents
of
her
*NL*
mantel-shelf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
that
I
'm
to
be
severely
taught
the
disadvantages

a
false

position

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

she
said
softly
,
``
if
I
had
a
child

*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
waited
,
and
then
,
with
a
little
formal
air
,
``
The
children
of
*NL*
others
may
be
a
great
interest

he
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
more
like

There
's
something
after

us
together

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
the
idea

the
harm

may
do

Osmond
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

the

good
I

that

Madame
*NL*
Merle
pursued
,
``
that
made
me
so
jealous
of
Isabel

I
want
it
to
be

MY
work

''
she
added
,
with
her
face
,
which
had
grown
hard
and
bitter
,
*NL*
relaxing
to
its
habit
of
smoothness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
friend
took
up
his
hat
and
his
umbrella
,
and
after
giving
the
*NL*
former
article
two
or
three
strokes
with
his
coat-cuff
,
``
On
the
whole

*NL*
After

left

she
went
,
the
first

,
and
lifted
from
the
*NL*
mantel-shelf
the
attenuated
coffee-cup
in
which
he
had
mentioned
the
*NL*
existence
of
a
crack
;
but
she
looked
at
it
rather
abstractedly

vile

she
vaguely
wailed

CHAPTER
L
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Countess
Gemini
was
not
acquainted
with
the
ancient
monuments
*NL*
Isabel
occasionally
offered
to
introduce
her
to
these
interesting
relics
*NL*
and
to
give
their
afternoon
drive
an
antiquarian
aim
.
The
Countess
,
who
*NL*
professed
to
think
her
sister-in-law
a
prodigy
of
learning
,
never
made
*NL*
an
objection
,
and
gazed
at
masses
of
Roman
brickwork
as
patiently
as
if
*NL*
they
had
been
mounds
of
modern
drapery
.
She
had
not
the
historic
sense
,
*NL*
though
she
had
in
some
directions
the
anecdotic
,
and
as
regards
herself
*NL*
the
apologetic
,
but
she
was
so
delighted
to
be
in
Rome
that
she
only
*NL*
desired
to
float
with
the
current
.
She
would
gladly
have
passed
an
hour
*NL*
every
day
in
the
damp
darkness
of
the
Baths
of
Titus
if
it
had
been
a
*NL*
condition
of
her
remaining
at
Palazzo
Roccanera
.
Isabel
,
however
,
was
*NL*
not
a
severe
cicerone
;
she
used
to
visit
the
ruins
chiefly
because
they
*NL*
offered
an
excuse
for
talking
about
other
matters
than
the
love
affairs
*NL*
of
the
ladies
of
Florence
,
as
to
which
her
companion
was
never
weary
*NL*
of
offering
information
.
It
must
be
added
that
during
these
visits
the
*NL*
Countess
forbade
herself
every
form
of
active
research
;
her
preference
*NL*
was
to
sit
in
the
carriage
and
exclaim
that
everything
was
most
*NL*
interesting
.
It
was
in
this
manner
that
she
had
hitherto
examined
the
*NL*
Coliseum
,
to
the
infinite
regret
of
her
niece
,
who
--
with
all
the
respect
*NL*
that
she
owed
her
--
could
not
see
why
she
should
not
descend
from
the
*NL*
vehicle
and
enter
the
building
.
Pansy
had
so
little
chance
to
ramble
*NL*
that
her
view
of
the
case
was
not
wholly
disinterested
;
it
may
be
*NL*
divined
that
she
had
a
secret
hope
that
,
once
inside
,
her
parents
'
guest
*NL*
might
be
induced
to
climb
to
the
upper
tiers
.
There
came
a
day
when
*NL*
the
Countess
announced
her
willingness
to
undertake
this
feat
--
a
mild
*NL*
afternoon
in
March
when
the
windy
month
expressed
itself
in
occasional
*NL*
puffs
of
spring
.
The
three
ladies
went
into
the
Coliseum
together
,
*NL*
but
Isabel
left
her
companions
to
wander
over
the
place
.
She
had
often
*NL*
ascended
to
those
desolate
ledges
from
which
the
Roman
crowd
used
to
*NL*
bellow
applause
and
where
now
the
wild
flowers
-LRB-
when
they
are
allowed
-RRB-
*NL*
bloom
in
the
deep
crevices
;
and
to-day
she
felt
weary
and
disposed
*NL*
to
sit
in
the
despoiled
arena
.
It
made
an
intermission
too
,
for
the
*NL*
Countess
often
asked
more
from
one
's
attention
than
she
gave
in
return
;
*NL*
and
Isabel
believed
that
when
she
was
alone
with
her
niece
she
let
the
*NL*
dust
gather
for
a
moment
on
the
ancient
scandals
of
the
Arnide
.
She
so
*NL*
remained
below
therefore
,
while
Pansy
guided
her
undiscriminating
aunt
*NL*
to
the
steep
brick
staircase
at
the
foot
of
which
the
custodian
unlocks
*NL*
the
tall
wooden
gate
.
The
great
enclosure
was
half
in
shadow
;
the
*NL*
western
sun
brought
out
the
pale
red
tone
of
the
great
blocks
of
*NL*
travertine
--
the
latent
colour
that
is
the
only
living
element
in
the
*NL*
immense
ruin
.
Here
and
there
wandered
a
peasant
or
a
tourist
,
looking
*NL*
up
at
the
far
sky-line
where
,
in
the
clear
stillness
,
a
multitude
of
*NL*
swallows
kept
circling
and
plunging
.
Isabel
presently
became
aware
*NL*
that
one
of
the
other
visitors
,
planted
in
the
middle
of
the
arena
,
had
*NL*
turned
his
attention
to
her
own
person
and
was
looking
at
her
with
*NL*
a
certain
little
poise
of
the
head
which
she
had
some
weeks
before
*NL*
perceived
to
be
characteristic
of
baffled
but
indestructible
purpose
.
*NL*
Such
an
attitude
,
to-day
,
could
belong
only
to
Mr.
Edward
Rosier
;
and
*NL*
this
gentleman
proved
in
fact
to
have
been
considering
the
question
of
*NL*
speaking
to
her
.
When
he
had
assured
himself
that
she
was
unaccompanied
*NL*
he
drew
near
,
remarking
that
though
she
would
not
answer
his
letters
*NL*
she
would
perhaps
not
wholly
close
her
ears
to
his
spoken
eloquence
.
She
*NL*
replied
that
her
stepdaughter
was
close
at
hand
and
that
she
could
only
*NL*
give
him
five
minutes
;
whereupon
he
took
out
his
watch
and
sat
down
upon
*NL*
a
broken
block
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
soon
told
,
''
said
Edward
Rosier
.
``
I
've
sold
all
my
bibelots
!
''
*NL*
Isabel
gave
instinctively
an
exclamation
of
horror
;
it
was
as
if
he
had
*NL*
told
her
he
had
had
all
his
teeth
drawn
.
``
I
've
sold
them
by
auction
at
*NL*
the
Hotel
Drouot
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
The
sale
took
place
three
days
ago
,
and
*NL*
they
've
telegraphed
me
the
result
.
It
's
magnificent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
;
but
I
wish
you
had
kept
your
pretty
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
money
instead
--
fifty
thousand
dollars
.
Will
Mr.
Osmond
think
*NL*
me
rich
enough
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
for
that
you
did
it
?
''
Isabel
asked
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
else
in
the
world
could
it
be
?
That
's
the
only
thing
I
think
*NL*
of
.
I
went
to
Paris
and
made
my
arrangements
.
I
could
n't
stop
for
the
*NL*
sale
;
I
could
n't
have
seen
them
going
off
;
I
think
it
would
have
killed
*NL*
me
.
But
I
put
them
into
good
hands
,
and
they
brought
high
prices
.
I
*NL*
should
tell
you
I
have
kept
my
enamels
.
Now
I
have
the
money
in
my
*NL*
pocket
,
and
he
ca
n't
say
I
'm
poor
!
''
the
young
man
exclaimed
defiantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
say
now
that
you
're
not
wise
,
''
said
Isabel
,
as
if
Gilbert
Osmond
*NL*
had
never
said
this
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rosier
gave
her
a
sharp
look
.
``
Do
you
mean
that
without
my
bibelots
I
'm
*NL*
nothing
?
Do
you
mean
they
were
the
best
thing
about
me
?
That
's
what
they
*NL*
told
me
in
Paris
;
oh
they
were
very
frank
about
it
.
But
they
had
n't
seen
*NL*
HER
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend
,
you
deserve
to
succeed
,
''
said
Isabel
very
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
that
so
sadly
that
it
's
the
same
as
if
you
said
I
should
n't
.
''
*NL*
And
he
questioned
her
eyes
with
the
clear
trepidation
of
his
own
.
He
had
*NL*
the
air
of
a
man
who
knows
he
has
been
the
talk
of
Paris
for
a
week
and
*NL*
is
full
half
a
head
taller
in
consequence
,
but
who
also
has
a
painful
*NL*
suspicion
that
in
spite
of
this
increase
of
stature
one
or
two
persons
*NL*
still
have
the
perversity
to
think
him
diminutive
.
``
I
know
what
happened
*NL*
here
while
I
was
away
,
''
he
went
on
;
``
What
does
Mr.
Osmond
expect
after
*NL*
she
has
refused
Lord
Warburton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
debated
.
``
That
she
'll
marry
another
nobleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
other
nobleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
that
he
'll
pick
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rosier
slowly
got
up
,
putting
his
watch
into
his
waistcoat-pocket
.
*NL*
``
You
're
laughing
at
some
one
,
but
this
time
I
do
n't
think
it
's
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mean
to
laugh
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
I
laugh
very
seldom
.
Now
you
had
*NL*
better
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
very
safe
!
''
Rosier
declared
without
moving
.
This
might
be
;
but
*NL*
it
evidently
made
him
feel
more
so
to
make
the
announcement
in
rather
*NL*
a
loud
voice
,
balancing
himself
a
little
complacently
on
his
toes
and
*NL*
looking
all
round
the
Coliseum
as
if
it
were
filled
with
an
audience
.
*NL*
Suddenly
Isabel
saw
him
change
colour
;
there
was
more
of
an
audience
*NL*
than
he
had
suspected
.
She
turned
and
perceived
that
her
two
companions
*NL*
had
returned
from
their
excursion
.
``
You
must
really
go
away
,
''
she
said
*NL*
quickly
.
``
Ah
,
my
dear
lady
,
pity
me
!
''
Edward
Rosier
murmured
in
a
voice
*NL*
strangely
at
variance
with
the
announcement
I
have
just
quoted
.
And
then
*NL*
he
added
eagerly
,
like
a
man
who
in
the
midst
of
his
misery
is
seized
by
*NL*
a
happy
thought
:
``
Is
that
lady
the
Countess
Gemini
?
I
've
a
great
desire
*NL*
to
be
presented
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
looked
at
him
a
moment
.
``
She
has
no
influence
with
her
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
a
monster
you
make
him
out
!
''
And
Rosier
faced
the
Countess
,
*NL*
who
advanced
,
in
front
of
Pansy
,
with
an
animation
partly
due
perhaps
*NL*
to
the
fact
that
she
perceived
her
sister-in-law
to
be
engaged
in
*NL*
conversation
with
a
very
pretty
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
've
kept
your
enamels
!
''
Isabel
called
as
she
left
him
.
She
*NL*
went
straight
to
Pansy
,
who
,
on
seeing
Edward
Rosier
,
had
stopped
short
,
*NL*
with
lowered
eyes
.
``
We
'll
go
back
to
the
carriage
,
''
she
said
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
getting
late
,
''
Pansy
returned
more
gently
still
.
And
she
*NL*
went
on
without
a
murmur
,
without
faltering
or
glancing
back
.
Isabel
,
*NL*
however
,
allowing
herself
this
last
liberty
,
saw
that
a
meeting
had
*NL*
immediately
taken
place
between
the
Countess
and
Mr.
Rosier
.
He
had
*NL*
removed
his
hat
and
was
bowing
and
smiling
;
he
had
evidently
introduced
*NL*
himself
,
while
the
Countess
's
expressive
back
displayed
to
Isabel
's
eye
*NL*
a
gracious
inclination
.
These
facts
,
none
the
less
,
were
presently
lost
*NL*
to
sight
,
for
Isabel
and
Pansy
took
their
places
again
in
the
carriage
.
*NL*
Pansy
,
who
faced
her
stepmother
,
at
first
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
*NL*
lap
;
then
she
raised
them
and
rested
them
on
Isabel
's
.
There
shone
out
*NL*
of
each
of
them
a
little
melancholy
ray
--
a
spark
of
timid
passion
which
*NL*
touched
Isabel
to
the
heart
.
At
the
same
time
a
wave
of
envy
passed
over
*NL*
her
soul
,
as
she
compared
the
tremulous
longing
,
the
definite
ideal
*NL*
of
the
child
with
her
own
dry
despair
.
``
Poor
little
Pansy
!
''
she
*NL*
affectionately
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
never
mind
!
''
Pansy
answered
in
the
tone
of
eager
apology
.
And
then
*NL*
there
was
a
silence
;
the
Countess
was
a
long
time
coming
.
``
Did
you
show
*NL*
your
aunt
everything
,
and
did
she
enjoy
it
?
''
Isabel
asked
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
showed
her
everything
.
I
think
she
was
very
much
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
're
not
tired
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
thank
you
,
I
'm
not
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
still
remained
behind
,
so
that
Isabel
requested
the
footman
*NL*
to
go
into
the
Coliseum
and
tell
her
they
were
waiting
.
He
presently
*NL*
returned
with
the
announcement
that
the
Signora
Contessa
begged
them
not
*NL*
to
wait
--
she
would
come
home
in
a
cab
!
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
week
after
this
lady
's
quick
sympathies
had
enlisted
themselves
*NL*
with
Mr.
Rosier
,
Isabel
,
going
rather
late
to
dress
for
dinner
,
found
*NL*
Pansy
sitting
in
her
room
.
The
girl
seemed
to
have
been
awaiting
her
;
*NL*
she
got
up
from
her
low
chair
.
``
Pardon
my
taking
the
liberty
,
''
she
said
*NL*
in
a
small
voice
.
``
It
will
be
the
last
--
for
some
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
was
strange
,
and
her
eyes
,
widely
opened
,
had
an
excited
,
*NL*
frightened
look
.
``
You
're
not
going
away
!
''
Isabel
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
the
convent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
convent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
drew
nearer
,
till
she
was
near
enough
to
put
her
arms
round
*NL*
Isabel
and
rest
her
head
on
her
shoulder
.
She
stood
this
way
a
moment
,
*NL*
perfectly
still
;
but
her
companion
could
feel
her
tremble
.
The
quiver
*NL*
of
her
little
body
expressed
everything
she
was
unable
to
say
.
Isabel
*NL*
nevertheless
pressed
her
.
``
Why
are
you
going
to
the
convent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
papa
thinks
it
best
.
He
says
a
young
girl
's
better
,
every
now
*NL*
and
then
,
for
making
a
little
retreat
.
He
says
the
world
,
always
the
*NL*
world
,
is
very
bad
for
a
young
girl
.
This
is
just
a
chance
for
a
little
*NL*
seclusion
--
a
little
reflexion
.
''
Pansy
spoke
in
short
detached
sentences
,
*NL*
as
if
she
could
scarce
trust
herself
;
and
then
she
added
with
a
triumph
*NL*
of
self-control
:
``
I
think
papa
's
right
;
I
've
been
so
much
in
the
world
*NL*
this
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
announcement
had
a
strange
effect
on
Isabel
;
it
seemed
to
carry
a
*NL*
larger
meaning
than
the
girl
herself
knew
.
``
When
was
this
decided
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
.
``
I
've
heard
nothing
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
told
me
half
an
hour
ago
;
he
thought
it
better
it
should
n't
be
*NL*
too
much
talked
about
in
advance
.
Madame
Catherine
's
to
come
for
me
at
a
*NL*
quarter
past
seven
,
and
I
'm
only
to
take
two
frocks
.
It
's
only
for
a
few
*NL*
weeks
;
I
'm
sure
it
will
be
very
good
.
I
shall
find
all
those
ladies
who
*NL*
used
to
be
so
kind
to
me
,
and
I
shall
see
the
little
girls
who
are
being
*NL*
educated
.
I
'm
very
fond
of
little
girls
,
''
said
Pansy
with
an
effect
*NL*
of
diminutive
grandeur
.
``
And
I
'm
also
very
fond
of
Mother
Catherine
.
I
*NL*
shall
be
very
quiet
and
think
a
great
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
listened
to
her
,
holding
her
breath
;
she
was
almost
awe-struck
.
*NL*
``
Think
of
ME
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
come
and
see
me
soon
!
''
cried
Pansy
;
and
the
cry
was
very
different
*NL*
from
the
heroic
remarks
of
which
she
had
just
delivered
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
could
say
nothing
more
;
she
understood
nothing
;
she
only
felt
how
*NL*
little
she
yet
knew
her
husband
.
Her
answer
to
his
daughter
was
a
long
,
*NL*
tender
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
she
learned
from
her
maid
that
Madame
Catherine
had
*NL*
arrived
in
a
cab
and
had
departed
again
with
the
signorina
.
On
going
to
*NL*
the
drawing-room
before
dinner
she
found
the
Countess
Gemini
alone
,
and
*NL*
this
lady
characterised
the
incident
by
exclaiming
,
with
a
wonderful
*NL*
toss
of
the
head
,
``
En
voila
,
ma
chere
,
une
pose
!
''
But
if
it
was
an
*NL*
affectation
she
was
at
a
loss
to
see
what
her
husband
affected
.
She
*NL*
could
only
dimly
perceive
that
he
had
more
traditions
than
she
supposed
.
*NL*
It
had
become
her
habit
to
be
so
careful
as
to
what
she
said
to
him
*NL*
that
,
strange
as
it
may
appear
,
she
hesitated
,
for
several
minutes
after
*NL*
he
had
come
in
,
to
allude
to
his
daughter
's
sudden
departure
:
she
*NL*
spoke
of
it
only
after
they
were
seated
at
table
.
But
she
had
forbidden
*NL*
herself
ever
to
ask
Osmond
a
question
.
All
she
could
do
was
to
make
a
*NL*
declaration
,
and
there
was
one
that
came
very
naturally
.
``
I
shall
miss
*NL*
Pansy
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
a
while
,
with
his
head
inclined
a
little
,
at
the
basket
of
*NL*
flowers
in
the
middle
of
the
table
.
``
Ah
yes
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
I
had
*NL*
thought
of
that
.
You
must
go
and
see
her
,
you
know
;
but
not
too
often
.
I
*NL*
dare
say
you
wonder
why
I
sent
her
to
the
good
sisters
;
but
I
doubt
if
I
*NL*
can
make
you
understand
.
It
does
n't
matter
;
do
n't
trouble
yourself
about
*NL*
it
.
That
's
why
I
had
not
spoken
of
it
.
I
did
n't
believe
you
would
enter
*NL*
into
it
.
But
I
've
always
had
the
idea
;
I
've
always
thought
it
a
part
*NL*
of
the
education
of
one
's
daughter
.
One
's
daughter
should
be
fresh
and
*NL*
fair
;
she
should
be
innocent
and
gentle
.
With
the
manners
of
the
present
*NL*
time
she
is
liable
to
become
so
dusty
and
crumpled
.
Pansy
's
a
little
*NL*
dusty
,
a
little
dishevelled
;
she
has
knocked
about
too
much
.
This
*NL*
bustling
,
pushing
rabble
that
calls
itself
society
--
one
should
take
her
*NL*
out
of
it
occasionally
.
Convents
are
very
quiet
,
very
convenient
,
very
*NL*
salutary
.
I
like
to
think
of
her
there
,
in
the
old
garden
,
under
*NL*
the
arcade
,
among
those
tranquil
virtuous
women
.
Many
of
them
are
*NL*
gentlewomen
born
;
several
of
them
are
noble
.
She
will
have
her
books
*NL*
and
her
drawing
,
she
will
have
her
piano
.
I
've
made
the
most
liberal
*NL*
arrangements
.
There
is
to
be
nothing
ascetic
;
there
's
just
to
be
a
*NL*
certain
little
sense
of
sequestration
.
She
'll
have
time
to
think
,
and
*NL*
there
's
something
I
want
her
to
think
about
.
''
Osmond
spoke
deliberately
,
*NL*
reasonably
,
still
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
as
if
he
were
looking
at
*NL*
the
basket
of
flowers
.
His
tone
,
however
,
was
that
of
a
man
not
so
*NL*
much
offering
an
explanation
as
putting
a
thing
into
words
--
almost
into
*NL*
pictures
--
to
see
,
himself
,
how
it
would
look
.
He
considered
a
while
the
*NL*
picture
he
had
evoked
and
seemed
greatly
pleased
with
it
.
And
then
he
*NL*
went
on
:
``
The
Catholics
are
very
wise
after
all
.
The
convent
is
a
great
*NL*
institution
;
we
ca
n't
do
without
it
;
it
corresponds
to
an
essential
need
*NL*
in
families
,
in
society
.
It
's
a
school
of
good
manners
;
it
's
a
school
*NL*
of
repose
.
Oh
,
I
do
n't
want
to
detach
my
daughter
from
the
world
,
''
he
*NL*
added
;
``
I
do
n't
want
to
make
her
fix
her
thoughts
on
any
other
.
This
*NL*
one
's
very
well
,
as
SHE
should
take
it
,
and
she
may
think
of
it
as
much
*NL*
as
she
likes
.
Only
she
must
think
of
it
in
the
right
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
gave
an
extreme
attention
to
this
little
sketch
;
she
found
*NL*
it
indeed
intensely
interesting
.
It
seemed
to
show
her
how
far
her
*NL*
husband
's
desire
to
be
effective
was
capable
of
going
--
to
the
point
of
*NL*
playing
theoretic
tricks
on
the
delicate
organism
of
his
daughter
.
She
*NL*
could
not
understand
his
purpose
,
no
--
not
wholly
;
but
she
understood
it
*NL*
better
than
he
supposed
or
desired
,
inasmuch
as
she
was
convinced
*NL*
that
the
whole
proceeding
was
an
elaborate
mystification
,
addressed
to
*NL*
herself
and
destined
to
act
upon
her
imagination
.
He
had
wanted
to
do
*NL*
something
sudden
and
arbitrary
,
something
unexpected
and
refined
;
to
*NL*
mark
the
difference
between
his
sympathies
and
her
own
,
and
show
that
*NL*
if
he
regarded
his
daughter
as
a
precious
work
of
art
it
was
natural
*NL*
he
should
be
more
and
more
careful
about
the
finishing
touches
.
If
he
*NL*
wished
to
be
effective
he
had
succeeded
;
the
incident
struck
a
chill
*NL*
into
Isabel
's
heart
.
Pansy
had
known
the
convent
in
her
childhood
and
*NL*
had
found
a
happy
home
there
;
she
was
fond
of
the
good
sisters
,
who
were
*NL*
very
fond
of
her
,
and
there
was
therefore
for
the
moment
no
definite
*NL*
hardship
in
her
lot
.
But
all
the
same
the
girl
had
taken
fright
;
the
*NL*
impression
her
father
desired
to
make
would
evidently
be
sharp
enough
.
*NL*
The
old
Protestant
tradition
had
never
faded
from
Isabel
's
imagination
,
*NL*
and
as
her
thoughts
attached
themselves
to
this
striking
example
of
*NL*
her
husband
's
genius
--
she
sat
looking
,
like
him
,
at
the
basket
of
*NL*
flowers
--
poor
little
Pansy
became
the
heroine
of
a
tragedy
.
Osmond
*NL*
wished
it
to
be
known
that
he
shrank
from
nothing
,
and
his
wife
found
it
*NL*
hard
to
pretend
to
eat
her
dinner
.
There
was
a
certain
relief
presently
,
*NL*
in
hearing
the
high
,
strained
voice
of
her
sister-in-law
.
The
Countess
*NL*
too
,
apparently
,
had
been
thinking
the
thing
out
,
but
had
arrived
at
a
*NL*
different
conclusion
from
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
absurd
,
my
dear
Osmond
,
''
she
said
,
``
to
invent
so
many
pretty
*NL*
reasons
for
poor
Pansy
's
banishment
.
Why
do
n't
you
say
at
once
that
you
*NL*
want
to
get
her
out
of
my
way
?
Have
n't
you
discovered
that
I
think
very
*NL*
well
of
Mr.
Rosier
?
I
do
indeed
;
he
seems
to
me
simpaticissimo
.
He
has
*NL*
made
me
believe
in
true
love
;
I
never
did
before
!
Of
course
you
've
*NL*
made
up
your
mind
that
with
those
convictions
I
'm
dreadful
company
for
*NL*
Pansy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
took
a
sip
of
a
glass
of
wine
;
he
looked
perfectly
good-humoured
.
*NL*
``
My
dear
Amy
,
''
he
answered
,
smiling
as
if
he
were
uttering
a
piece
*NL*
of
gallantry
,
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
your
convictions
,
but
if
*NL*
I
suspected
that
they
interfere
with
mine
it
would
be
much
simpler
to
*NL*
banish
YOU
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
LI
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
was
not
banished
,
but
she
felt
the
insecurity
of
her
tenure
*NL*
of
her
brother
's
hospitality
.
A
week
after
this
incident
Isabel
received
*NL*
a
telegram
from
England
,
dated
from
Gardencourt
and
bearing
the
stamp
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
's
authorship
.
``
Ralph
can
not
last
many
days
,
''
it
ran
,
``
and
*NL*
if
convenient
would
like
to
see
you
.
Wishes
me
to
say
that
you
must
come
*NL*
only
if
you
've
not
other
duties
.
Say
,
for
myself
,
that
you
used
to
talk
*NL*
a
good
deal
about
your
duty
and
to
wonder
what
it
was
;
shall
be
curious
*NL*
to
see
whether
you
've
found
it
out
.
Ralph
is
really
dying
,
and
there
's
*NL*
no
other
company
.
''
Isabel
was
prepared
for
this
news
,
having
received
*NL*
from
Henrietta
Stackpole
a
detailed
account
of
her
journey
to
England
*NL*
with
her
appreciative
patient
.
Ralph
had
arrived
more
dead
than
alive
,
*NL*
but
she
had
managed
to
convey
him
to
Gardencourt
,
where
he
had
taken
to
*NL*
his
bed
,
which
,
as
Miss
Stackpole
wrote
,
he
evidently
would
never
leave
*NL*
again
.
She
added
that
she
had
really
had
two
patients
on
her
hands
*NL*
instead
of
one
,
inasmuch
as
Mr.
Goodwood
,
who
had
been
of
no
earthly
*NL*
use
,
was
quite
as
ailing
,
in
a
different
way
,
as
Mr.
Touchett
.
*NL*
Afterwards
she
wrote
that
she
had
been
obliged
to
surrender
the
field
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
,
who
had
just
returned
from
America
and
had
promptly
given
*NL*
her
to
understand
that
she
did
n't
wish
any
interviewing
at
Gardencourt
.
*NL*
Isabel
had
written
to
her
aunt
shortly
after
Ralph
came
to
Rome
,
letting
*NL*
her
know
of
his
critical
condition
and
suggesting
that
she
should
*NL*
lose
no
time
in
returning
to
Europe
.
Mrs.
Touchett
had
telegraphed
an
*NL*
acknowledgement
of
this
admonition
,
and
the
only
further
news
Isabel
*NL*
received
from
her
was
the
second
telegram
I
have
just
quoted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
stood
a
moment
looking
at
the
latter
missive
;
then
,
thrusting
it
*NL*
into
her
pocket
,
she
went
straight
to
the
door
of
her
husband
's
study
.
*NL*
Here
she
again
paused
an
instant
,
after
which
she
opened
the
door
and
*NL*
went
in
.
Osmond
was
seated
at
the
table
near
the
window
with
a
folio
*NL*
volume
before
him
,
propped
against
a
pile
of
books
.
This
volume
was
open
*NL*
at
a
page
of
small
coloured
plates
,
and
Isabel
presently
saw
that
he
*NL*
had
been
copying
from
it
the
drawing
of
an
antique
coin
.
A
box
of
*NL*
water-colours
and
fine
brushes
lay
before
him
,
and
he
had
already
*NL*
transferred
to
a
sheet
of
immaculate
paper
the
delicate
,
finely-tinted
*NL*
disk
.
His
back
was
turned
toward
the
door
,
but
he
recognised
his
wife
*NL*
without
looking
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
for
disturbing
you
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
come
to
your
room
I
always
knock
,
''
he
answered
,
going
on
with
*NL*
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgot
;
I
had
something
else
to
think
of
.
My
cousin
's
dying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
do
n't
believe
that
,
''
said
Osmond
,
looking
at
his
drawing
through
*NL*
a
magnifying
glass
.
``
He
was
dying
when
we
married
;
he
'll
outlive
us
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
gave
herself
no
time
,
no
thought
,
to
appreciate
the
careful
*NL*
cynicism
of
this
declaration
;
she
simply
went
on
quickly
,
full
of
*NL*
her
own
intention
``
My
aunt
has
telegraphed
for
me
;
I
must
go
to
*NL*
Gardencourt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
must
you
go
to
Gardencourt
?
''
Osmond
asked
in
the
tone
of
impartial
*NL*
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
Ralph
before
he
dies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
,
for
some
time
,
he
made
no
rejoinder
;
he
continued
to
give
his
*NL*
chief
attention
to
his
work
,
which
was
of
a
sort
that
would
brook
no
*NL*
negligence
.
``
I
do
n't
see
the
need
of
it
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
He
came
to
*NL*
see
you
here
.
I
did
n't
like
that
;
I
thought
his
being
in
Rome
a
great
*NL*
mistake
.
But
I
tolerated
it
because
it
was
to
be
the
last
time
you
*NL*
should
see
him
.
Now
you
tell
me
it
's
not
to
have
been
the
last
.
Ah
,
*NL*
you
're
not
grateful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
be
grateful
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gilbert
Osmond
laid
down
his
little
implements
,
blew
a
speck
of
dust
*NL*
from
his
drawing
,
slowly
got
up
,
and
for
the
first
time
looked
at
his
*NL*
wife
.
``
For
my
not
having
interfered
while
he
was
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
am
.
I
remember
perfectly
how
distinctly
you
let
me
know
you
*NL*
did
n't
like
it
.
I
was
very
glad
when
he
went
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
him
alone
then
.
Do
n't
run
after
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
turned
her
eyes
away
from
him
;
they
rested
upon
his
little
*NL*
drawing
.
``
I
must
go
to
England
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
full
consciousness
*NL*
that
her
tone
might
strike
an
irritable
man
of
taste
as
stupidly
*NL*
obstinate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
like
it
if
you
do
,
''
Osmond
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
mind
that
?
You
wo
n't
like
it
if
I
do
n't
.
You
like
nothing
*NL*
I
do
or
do
n't
do
.
You
pretend
to
think
I
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Osmond
turned
slightly
pale
;
he
gave
a
cold
smile
.
``
That
's
why
you
must
*NL*
go
then
?
Not
to
see
your
cousin
,
but
to
take
a
revenge
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
about
revenge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
said
Osmond
.
``
Do
n't
give
me
an
occasion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
only
too
eager
to
take
one
.
You
wish
immensely
that
I
would
*NL*
commit
some
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
gratified
in
that
case
if
you
disobeyed
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
disobeyed
you
?
''
said
Isabel
in
a
low
tone
which
had
the
effect
of
*NL*
mildness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
be
clear
.
If
you
leave
Rome
to-day
it
will
be
a
piece
of
the
*NL*
most
deliberate
,
the
most
calculated
,
opposition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
call
it
calculated
?
I
received
my
aunt
's
telegram
but
three
*NL*
minutes
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
calculate
rapidly
;
it
's
a
great
accomplishment
.
I
do
n't
see
why
we
*NL*
should
prolong
our
discussion
;
you
know
my
wish
.
''
And
he
stood
there
as
*NL*
if
he
expected
to
see
her
withdraw
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
never
moved
;
she
could
n't
move
,
strange
as
it
may
seem
;
she
*NL*
still
wished
to
justify
herself
;
he
had
the
power
,
in
an
extraordinary
*NL*
degree
,
of
making
her
feel
this
need
.
There
was
something
in
her
*NL*
imagination
he
could
always
appeal
to
against
her
judgement
.
``
You
've
no
*NL*
reason
for
such
a
wish
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
and
I
've
every
reason
for
going
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
unjust
you
seem
to
me
.
But
I
think
you
know
.
It
's
*NL*
your
own
opposition
that
's
calculated
.
It
's
malignant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
never
uttered
her
worst
thought
to
her
husband
before
,
and
the
*NL*
sensation
of
hearing
it
was
evidently
new
to
Osmond
.
But
he
showed
no
*NL*
surprise
,
and
his
coolness
was
apparently
a
proof
that
he
had
believed
*NL*
his
wife
would
in
fact
be
unable
to
resist
for
ever
his
ingenious
*NL*
endeavour
to
draw
her
out
.
``
It
's
all
the
more
intense
then
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
And
he
added
almost
as
if
he
were
giving
her
a
friendly
*NL*
counsel
:
``
This
is
a
very
important
matter
.
''
She
recognised
that
;
she
*NL*
was
fully
conscious
of
the
weight
of
the
occasion
;
she
knew
that
between
*NL*
them
they
had
arrived
at
a
crisis
.
Its
gravity
made
her
careful
;
she
*NL*
said
nothing
,
and
he
went
on
.
``
You
say
I
've
no
reason
?
I
have
the
very
*NL*
best
.
I
dislike
,
from
the
bottom
of
my
soul
,
what
you
intend
to
do
.
It
's
*NL*
dishonourable
;
it
's
indelicate
;
it
's
indecent
.
Your
cousin
is
nothing
*NL*
whatever
to
me
,
and
I
'm
under
no
obligation
to
make
concessions
to
him
.
*NL*
I
've
already
made
the
very
handsomest
.
Your
relations
with
him
,
while
he
*NL*
was
here
,
kept
me
on
pins
and
needles
;
but
I
let
that
pass
,
because
from
*NL*
week
to
week
I
expected
him
to
go
.
I
've
never
liked
him
and
he
has
never
*NL*
liked
me
.
That
's
why
you
like
him
--
because
he
hates
me
,
''
said
Osmond
*NL*
with
a
quick
,
barely
audible
tremor
in
his
voice
.
``
I
've
an
ideal
of
what
*NL*
my
wife
should
do
and
should
not
do
.
She
should
not
travel
across
Europe
*NL*
alone
,
in
defiance
of
my
deepest
desire
,
to
sit
at
the
bedside
of
other
*NL*
men
.
Your
cousin
's
nothing
to
you
;
he
's
nothing
to
us
.
You
smile
most
*NL*
expressively
when
I
talk
about
US
,
but
I
assure
you
that
WE
,
WE
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Osmond
,
is
all
I
know
.
I
take
our
marriage
seriously
;
you
appear
to
*NL*
have
found
a
way
of
not
doing
so
.
I
'm
not
aware
that
we
're
divorced
or
*NL*
separated
;
for
me
we
're
indissolubly
united
.
You
are
nearer
to
me
than
*NL*
any
human
creature
,
and
I
'm
nearer
to
you
.
It
may
be
a
disagreeable
*NL*
proximity
;
it
's
one
,
at
any
rate
,
of
our
own
deliberate
making
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
like
to
be
reminded
of
that
,
I
know
;
but
I
'm
perfectly
willing
,
*NL*
because
--
because
--
''
And
he
paused
a
moment
,
looking
as
if
he
had
*NL*
something
to
say
which
would
be
very
much
to
the
point
.
``
Because
I
think
*NL*
we
should
accept
the
consequences
of
our
actions
,
and
what
I
value
most
*NL*
in
life
is
the
honour
of
a
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
gravely
and
almost
gently
;
the
accent
of
sarcasm
had
dropped
*NL*
out
of
his
tone
.
It
had
a
gravity
which
checked
his
wife
's
quick
*NL*
emotion
;
the
resolution
with
which
she
had
entered
the
room
found
itself
*NL*
caught
in
a
mesh
of
fine
threads
.
His
last
words
were
not
a
command
,
*NL*
they
constituted
a
kind
of
appeal
;
and
,
though
she
felt
that
any
*NL*
expression
of
respect
on
his
part
could
only
be
a
refinement
of
egotism
,
*NL*
they
represented
something
transcendent
and
absolute
,
like
the
sign
*NL*
of
the
cross
or
the
flag
of
one
's
country
.
He
spoke
in
the
name
of
*NL*
something
sacred
and
precious
--
the
observance
of
a
magnificent
form
.
*NL*
They
were
as
perfectly
apart
in
feeling
as
two
disillusioned
lovers
*NL*
had
ever
been
;
but
they
had
never
yet
separated
in
act
.
Isabel
had
not
*NL*
changed
;
her
old
passion
for
justice
still
abode
within
her
;
and
now
,
in
*NL*
the
very
thick
of
her
sense
of
her
husband
's
blasphemous
sophistry
,
it
*NL*
began
to
throb
to
a
tune
which
for
a
moment
promised
him
the
victory
.
It
*NL*
came
over
her
that
in
his
wish
to
preserve
appearances
he
was
after
*NL*
all
sincere
,
and
that
this
,
as
far
as
it
went
,
was
a
merit
.
Ten
minutes
*NL*
before
she
had
felt
all
the
joy
of
irreflective
action
--
a
joy
to
which
*NL*
she
had
so
long
been
a
stranger
;
but
action
had
been
suddenly
changed
to
*NL*
slow
renunciation
,
transformed
by
the
blight
of
Osmond
's
touch
.
If
she
*NL*
must
renounce
,
however
,
she
would
let
him
know
she
was
a
victim
rather
*NL*
than
a
dupe
.
``
I
know
you
're
a
master
of
the
art
of
mockery
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
How
can
you
speak
of
an
indissoluble
union
--
how
can
you
speak
of
*NL*
your
being
contented
?
Where
's
our
union
when
you
accuse
me
of
falsity
?
*NL*
Where
's
your
contentment
when
you
have
nothing
but
hideous
suspicion
in
*NL*
your
heart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
in
our
living
decently
together
,
in
spite
of
such
drawbacks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
live
decently
together
!
''
cried
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
we
do
n't
if
you
go
to
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
little
;
that
's
nothing
.
I
might
do
much
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
eyebrows
and
even
his
shoulders
a
little
:
he
had
lived
*NL*
long
enough
in
Italy
to
catch
this
trick
.
``
Ah
,
if
you
've
come
to
*NL*
threaten
me
I
prefer
my
drawing
.
''
And
he
walked
back
to
his
table
,
where
*NL*
he
took
up
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
he
had
been
working
and
stood
*NL*
studying
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
if
I
go
you
'll
not
expect
me
to
come
back
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
quickly
round
,
and
she
could
see
this
movement
at
least
was
*NL*
not
designed
.
He
looked
at
her
a
little
,
and
then
,
``
Are
you
out
of
your
*NL*
mind
?
''
he
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
it
be
anything
but
a
rupture
?
''
she
went
on
;
``
especially
if
all
*NL*
you
say
is
true
?
''
She
was
unable
to
see
how
it
could
be
anything
but
a
*NL*
rupture
;
she
sincerely
wished
to
know
what
else
it
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
before
his
table
.
``
I
really
ca
n't
argue
with
you
on
the
*NL*
hypothesis
of
your
defying
me
,
''
he
said
.
And
he
took
up
one
of
his
*NL*
little
brushes
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lingered
but
a
moment
longer
;
long
enough
to
embrace
with
her
eye
*NL*
his
whole
deliberately
indifferent
yet
most
expressive
figure
;
after
*NL*
which
she
quickly
left
the
room
.
Her
faculties
,
her
energy
,
her
passion
,
*NL*
were
all
dispersed
again
;
she
felt
as
if
a
cold
,
dark
mist
had
suddenly
*NL*
encompassed
her
.
Osmond
possessed
in
a
supreme
degree
the
art
of
*NL*
eliciting
any
weakness
.
On
her
way
back
to
her
room
she
found
the
*NL*
Countess
Gemini
standing
in
the
open
doorway
of
a
little
parlour
in
*NL*
which
a
small
collection
of
heterogeneous
books
had
been
arranged
.
*NL*
The
Countess
had
an
open
volume
in
her
hand
;
she
appeared
to
have
been
*NL*
glancing
down
a
page
which
failed
to
strike
her
as
interesting
.
At
the
*NL*
sound
of
Isabel
's
step
she
raised
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
my
dear
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
,
who
are
so
literary
,
do
tell
me
some
*NL*
amusing
book
to
read
!
Everything
here
's
of
a
dreariness
--
!
Do
you
think
*NL*
this
would
do
me
any
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
glanced
at
the
title
of
the
volume
she
held
out
,
but
without
*NL*
reading
or
understanding
it
.
``
I
'm
afraid
I
ca
n't
advise
you
.
I
've
had
*NL*
bad
news
.
My
cousin
,
Ralph
Touchett
,
is
dying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
threw
down
her
book
.
``
Ah
,
he
was
so
simpatico
.
I
'm
awfully
*NL*
sorry
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
be
sorrier
still
if
you
knew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
there
to
know
?
You
look
very
badly
,
''
the
Countess
added
.
``
You
*NL*
must
have
been
with
Osmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
before
Isabel
would
have
listened
very
coldly
to
an
*NL*
intimation
that
she
should
ever
feel
a
desire
for
the
sympathy
of
*NL*
her
sister-in-law
,
and
there
can
be
no
better
proof
of
her
present
*NL*
embarrassment
than
the
fact
that
she
almost
clutched
at
this
lady
's
*NL*
fluttering
attention
.
``
I
've
been
with
Osmond
,
''
she
said
,
while
the
*NL*
Countess
's
bright
eyes
glittered
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
then
he
has
been
odious
!
''
the
Countess
cried
.
``
Did
he
say
he
*NL*
was
glad
poor
Mr.
Touchett
's
dying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
it
's
impossible
I
should
go
to
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
's
mind
,
when
her
interests
were
concerned
,
was
agile
;
she
*NL*
already
foresaw
the
extinction
of
any
further
brightness
in
her
visit
to
*NL*
Rome
.
Ralph
Touchett
would
die
,
Isabel
would
go
into
mourning
,
and
then
*NL*
there
would
be
no
more
dinner-parties
.
Such
a
prospect
produced
for
*NL*
a
moment
in
her
countenance
an
expressive
grimace
;
but
this
rapid
,
*NL*
picturesque
play
of
feature
was
her
only
tribute
to
disappointment
.
*NL*
After
all
,
she
reflected
,
the
game
was
almost
played
out
;
she
had
*NL*
already
overstayed
her
invitation
.
And
then
she
cared
enough
for
*NL*
Isabel
's
trouble
to
forget
her
own
,
and
she
saw
that
Isabel
's
trouble
*NL*
was
deep
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
deeper
than
the
mere
death
of
a
cousin
,
and
the
Countess
had
*NL*
no
hesitation
in
connecting
her
exasperating
brother
with
the
expression
*NL*
of
her
sister-in-law
's
eyes
.
Her
heart
beat
with
an
almost
joyous
*NL*
expectation
,
for
if
she
had
wished
to
see
Osmond
overtopped
the
*NL*
conditions
looked
favourable
now
.
Of
course
if
Isabel
should
go
to
*NL*
England
she
herself
would
immediately
leave
Palazzo
Roccanera
;
nothing
*NL*
would
induce
her
to
remain
there
with
Osmond
.
Nevertheless
she
felt
*NL*
an
immense
desire
to
hear
that
Isabel
would
go
to
England
.
``
Nothing
's
*NL*
impossible
for
you
,
my
dear
,
''
she
said
caressingly
.
``
Why
else
are
you
*NL*
rich
and
clever
and
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
indeed
?
I
feel
stupidly
weak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
Osmond
say
it
's
impossible
?
''
the
Countess
asked
in
a
tone
*NL*
which
sufficiently
declared
that
she
could
n't
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
she
thus
began
to
question
her
,
however
,
Isabel
drew
*NL*
back
;
she
disengaged
her
hand
,
which
the
Countess
had
affectionately
*NL*
taken
.
But
she
answered
this
enquiry
with
frank
bitterness
.
``
Because
*NL*
we
're
so
happy
together
that
we
ca
n't
separate
even
for
a
fortnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
cried
the
Countess
while
Isabel
turned
away
,
``
when
I
want
to
make
*NL*
a
journey
my
husband
simply
tells
me
I
can
have
no
money
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
went
to
her
room
,
where
she
walked
up
and
down
for
an
hour
.
It
*NL*
may
appear
to
some
readers
that
she
gave
herself
much
trouble
,
and
it
is
*NL*
certain
that
for
a
woman
of
a
high
spirit
she
had
allowed
herself
easily
*NL*
to
be
arrested
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
only
now
she
fully
measured
the
*NL*
great
undertaking
of
matrimony
.
Marriage
meant
that
in
such
a
case
as
*NL*
this
,
when
one
had
to
choose
,
one
chose
as
a
matter
of
course
for
one
's
*NL*
husband
.
``
I
'm
afraid
--
yes
,
I
'm
afraid
,
''
she
said
to
herself
more
than
*NL*
once
,
stopping
short
in
her
walk
.
But
what
she
was
afraid
of
was
not
her
*NL*
husband
--
his
displeasure
,
his
hatred
,
his
revenge
;
it
was
not
even
her
*NL*
own
later
judgement
of
her
conduct
a
consideration
which
had
often
held
*NL*
her
in
check
;
it
was
simply
the
violence
there
would
be
in
going
when
*NL*
Osmond
wished
her
to
remain
.
A
gulf
of
difference
had
opened
between
*NL*
them
,
but
nevertheless
it
was
his
desire
that
she
should
stay
,
it
was
*NL*
a
horror
to
him
that
she
should
go
.
She
knew
the
nervous
fineness
with
*NL*
which
he
could
feel
an
objection
.
What
he
thought
of
her
she
knew
,
what
*NL*
he
was
capable
of
saying
to
her
she
had
felt
;
yet
they
were
married
,
for
*NL*
all
that
,
and
marriage
meant
that
a
woman
should
cleave
to
the
man
with
*NL*
whom
,
uttering
tremendous
vows
,
she
had
stood
at
the
altar
.
She
sank
*NL*
down
on
her
sofa
at
last
and
buried
her
head
in
a
pile
of
cushions
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
raised
her
head
again
the
Countess
Gemini
hovered
before
her
.
*NL*
She
had
come
in
all
unperceived
;
she
had
a
strange
smile
on
her
thin
*NL*
lips
and
her
whole
face
had
grown
in
an
hour
a
shining
intimation
.
She
*NL*
lived
assuredly
,
it
might
be
said
,
at
the
window
of
her
spirit
,
but
now
*NL*
she
was
leaning
far
out
.
``
I
knocked
,
''
she
began
,
``
but
you
did
n't
*NL*
answer
me
.
So
I
ventured
in
.
I
've
been
looking
at
you
for
the
past
five
*NL*
minutes
.
You
're
very
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
do
n't
think
you
can
comfort
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
give
me
leave
to
try
?
''
And
the
Countess
sat
down
on
the
*NL*
sofa
beside
her
.
She
continued
to
smile
,
and
there
was
something
*NL*
communicative
and
exultant
in
her
expression
.
She
appeared
to
have
*NL*
a
deal
to
say
,
and
it
occurred
to
Isabel
for
the
first
time
that
her
*NL*
sister-in-law
might
say
something
really
human
.
She
made
play
with
her
*NL*
glittering
eyes
,
in
which
there
was
an
unpleasant
fascination
.
``
After
*NL*
all
,
''
she
soon
resumed
,
``
I
must
tell
you
,
to
begin
with
,
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
understand
your
state
of
mind
.
You
seem
to
have
so
many
scruples
,
so
*NL*
many
reasons
,
so
many
ties
.
When
I
discovered
,
ten
years
ago
,
that
my
*NL*
husband
's
dearest
wish
was
to
make
me
miserable
--
of
late
he
has
simply
*NL*
let
me
alone
--
ah
,
it
was
a
wonderful
simplification
!
My
poor
Isabel
,
*NL*
you
're
not
simple
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
simple
enough
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
something
I
want
you
to
know
,
''
the
Countess
declared
--
``
because
*NL*
I
think
you
ought
to
know
it
.
Perhaps
you
do
;
perhaps
you
've
guessed
it
.
*NL*
But
if
you
have
,
all
I
can
say
is
that
I
understand
still
less
why
you
*NL*
should
n't
do
as
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
wish
me
to
know
?
''
Isabel
felt
a
foreboding
that
made
her
*NL*
heart
beat
faster
.
The
Countess
was
about
to
justify
herself
,
and
this
*NL*
alone
was
portentous
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
nevertheless
disposed
to
play
a
little
with
her
subject
.
*NL*
``
In
your
place
I
should
have
guessed
it
ages
ago
.
Have
you
never
really
*NL*
suspected
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
guessed
nothing
.
What
should
I
have
suspected
?
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
because
you
've
such
a
beastly
pure
mind
.
I
never
saw
a
woman
*NL*
with
such
a
pure
mind
!
''
cried
the
Countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
slowly
got
up
.
``
You
're
going
to
tell
me
something
horrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
call
it
by
whatever
name
you
will
!
''
And
the
Countess
rose
*NL*
also
,
while
her
gathered
perversity
grew
vivid
and
dreadful
.
She
stood
*NL*
a
moment
in
a
sort
of
glare
of
intention
and
,
as
seemed
to
Isabel
even
*NL*
then
,
of
ugliness
;
after
which
she
said
:
``
My
first
sister-in-law
had
no
*NL*
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
stared
back
at
her
;
the
announcement
was
an
anticlimax
.
``
Your
*NL*
first
sister-in-law
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
know
at
least
,
if
one
may
mention
it
,
that
Osmond
has
*NL*
been
married
before
!
I
've
never
spoken
to
you
of
his
wife
;
I
thought
it
*NL*
might
n't
be
decent
or
respectful
.
But
others
,
less
particular
,
must
*NL*
have
done
so
.
The
poor
little
woman
lived
hardly
three
years
and
died
*NL*
childless
.
It
was
n't
till
after
her
death
that
Pansy
arrived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
's
brow
had
contracted
to
a
frown
;
her
lips
were
parted
in
pale
,
*NL*
vague
wonder
.
She
was
trying
to
follow
;
there
seemed
so
much
more
to
*NL*
follow
than
she
could
see
.
``
Pansy
's
not
my
husband
's
child
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
husband
's
--
in
perfection
!
But
no
one
else
's
husband
's
.
Some
one
*NL*
else
's
wife
's
.
Ah
,
my
good
Isabel
,
''
cried
the
Countess
,
``
with
you
one
*NL*
must
dot
one
's
i
's
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
.
Whose
wife
's
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wife
of
a
horrid
little
Swiss
who
died
--
how
long
?
--
a
dozen
,
more
*NL*
than
fifteen
,
years
ago
.
He
never
recognised
Miss
Pansy
,
nor
,
knowing
*NL*
what
he
was
about
,
would
have
anything
to
say
to
her
;
and
there
was
no
*NL*
reason
why
he
should
.
Osmond
did
,
and
that
was
better
;
though
he
had
to
*NL*
fit
on
afterwards
the
whole
rigmarole
of
his
own
wife
's
having
died
in
*NL*
childbirth
,
and
of
his
having
,
in
grief
and
horror
,
banished
the
little
*NL*
girl
from
his
sight
for
as
long
as
possible
before
taking
her
home
from
*NL*
nurse
.
His
wife
had
really
died
,
you
know
,
of
quite
another
matter
and
*NL*
in
quite
another
place
:
in
the
Piedmontese
mountains
,
where
they
had
*NL*
gone
,
one
August
,
because
her
health
appeared
to
require
the
air
,
but
*NL*
where
she
was
suddenly
taken
worse
--
fatally
ill
.
The
story
passed
,
*NL*
sufficiently
;
it
was
covered
by
the
appearances
so
long
as
nobody
*NL*
heeded
,
as
nobody
cared
to
look
into
it
.
But
of
course
I
knew
--
without
*NL*
researches
,
''
the
Countess
lucidly
proceeded
;
``
as
also
,
you
'll
*NL*
understand
,
without
a
word
said
between
us
--
I
mean
between
Osmond
and
*NL*
me
.
Do
n't
you
see
him
looking
at
me
,
in
silence
,
that
way
,
to
settle
*NL*
it
?
--
that
is
to
settle
ME
if
I
should
say
anything
.
I
said
nothing
,
*NL*
right
or
left
--
never
a
word
to
a
creature
,
if
you
can
believe
that
of
*NL*
me
:
on
my
honour
,
my
dear
,
I
speak
of
the
thing
to
you
now
,
after
all
*NL*
this
time
,
as
I
've
never
,
never
spoken
.
It
was
to
be
enough
for
me
,
*NL*
from
the
first
,
that
the
child
was
my
niece
--
from
the
moment
she
was
*NL*
my
brother
's
daughter
.
As
for
her
veritable
mother
--
!
''
But
with
this
*NL*
Pansy
's
wonderful
aunt
dropped
--
as
,
involuntarily
,
from
the
impression
*NL*
of
her
sister-in-law
's
face
,
out
of
which
more
eyes
might
have
seemed
to
*NL*
look
at
her
than
she
had
ever
had
to
meet
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
spoken
no
name
,
yet
Isabel
could
but
check
,
on
her
own
lips
,
an
*NL*
echo
of
the
unspoken
.
She
sank
to
her
seat
again
,
hanging
her
head
.
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
told
me
this
?
''
she
asked
in
a
voice
the
Countess
hardly
*NL*
recognised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
've
been
so
bored
with
your
not
knowing
.
I
've
been
bored
,
*NL*
frankly
,
my
dear
,
with
not
having
told
you
;
as
if
,
stupidly
,
all
this
*NL*
time
I
could
n't
have
managed
!
Ca
me
depasse
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
my
saying
*NL*
so
,
the
things
,
all
round
you
,
that
you
've
appeared
to
succeed
in
not
*NL*
knowing
.
It
's
a
sort
of
assistance
--
aid
to
innocent
ignorance
--
that
*NL*
I
've
always
been
a
bad
hand
at
rendering
;
and
in
this
connexion
,
that
*NL*
of
keeping
quiet
for
my
brother
,
my
virtue
has
at
any
rate
finally
*NL*
found
itself
exhausted
.
It
's
not
a
black
lie
,
moreover
,
you
know
,
''
the
*NL*
Countess
inimitably
added
.
``
The
facts
are
exactly
what
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
no
idea
,
''
said
Isabel
presently
;
and
looked
up
at
her
in
a
manner
*NL*
that
doubtless
matched
the
apparent
witlessness
of
this
confession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
believed
--
though
it
was
hard
to
believe
.
Had
it
never
occurred
to
*NL*
you
that
he
was
for
six
or
seven
years
her
lover
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Things
HAVE
occurred
to
me
,
and
perhaps
that
was
what
*NL*
they
all
meant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
been
wonderfully
clever
,
she
has
been
magnificent
,
about
*NL*
Pansy
!
''
the
Countess
,
before
all
this
view
of
it
,
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
idea
,
for
me
,
''
Isabel
went
on
,
``
ever
DEFINITELY
took
that
form
.
''
*NL*
She
appeared
to
be
making
out
to
herself
what
had
been
and
what
had
n't
.
*NL*
``
And
as
it
is
--
I
do
n't
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
as
one
troubled
and
puzzled
,
yet
the
poor
Countess
seemed
to
*NL*
have
seen
her
revelation
fall
below
its
possibilities
of
effect
.
She
*NL*
had
expected
to
kindle
some
responsive
blaze
,
but
had
barely
extracted
a
*NL*
spark
.
Isabel
showed
as
scarce
more
impressed
than
she
might
have
*NL*
been
,
as
a
young
woman
of
approved
imagination
,
with
some
fine
sinister
*NL*
passage
of
public
history
.
``
Do
n't
you
recognise
how
the
child
could
*NL*
never
pass
for
HER
husband
's
?
--
that
is
with
M.
Merle
himself
,
''
her
*NL*
companion
resumed
.
``
They
had
been
separated
too
long
for
that
,
and
he
*NL*
had
gone
to
some
far
country
--
I
think
to
South
America
.
If
she
had
ever
*NL*
had
children
--
which
I
'm
not
sure
of
--
she
had
lost
them
.
The
conditions
*NL*
happened
to
make
it
workable
,
under
stress
-LRB-
I
mean
at
so
awkward
a
*NL*
pinch
-RRB-
,
that
Osmond
should
acknowledge
the
little
girl
.
His
wife
was
*NL*
dead
--
very
true
;
but
she
had
not
been
dead
too
long
to
put
a
certain
*NL*
accommodation
of
dates
out
of
the
question
--
from
the
moment
,
I
mean
,
*NL*
that
suspicion
was
n't
started
;
which
was
what
they
had
to
take
care
of
.
*NL*
What
was
more
natural
than
that
poor
Mrs.
Osmond
,
at
a
distance
and
*NL*
for
a
world
not
troubling
about
trifles
,
should
have
left
behind
her
,
*NL*
poverina
,
the
pledge
of
her
brief
happiness
that
had
cost
her
her
life
?
*NL*
With
the
aid
of
a
change
of
residence
--
Osmond
had
been
living
with
her
*NL*
at
Naples
at
the
time
of
their
stay
in
the
Alps
,
and
he
in
due
course
*NL*
left
it
for
ever
--
the
whole
history
was
successfully
set
going
.
My
poor
*NL*
sister-in-law
,
in
her
grave
,
could
n't
help
herself
,
and
the
real
mother
,
*NL*
to
save
HER
skin
,
renounced
all
visible
property
in
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
poor
,
poor
woman
!
''
cried
Isabel
,
who
herewith
burst
into
tears
.
It
*NL*
was
a
long
time
since
she
had
shed
any
;
she
had
suffered
a
high
reaction
*NL*
from
weeping
.
But
now
they
flowed
with
an
abundance
in
which
the
*NL*
Countess
Gemini
found
only
another
discomfiture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
kind
of
you
to
pity
her
!
''
she
discordantly
laughed
.
``
Yes
*NL*
indeed
,
you
have
a
way
of
your
own
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
have
been
false
to
his
wife
--
and
so
very
soon
!
''
said
Isabel
*NL*
with
a
sudden
check
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
that
's
wanting
--
that
you
should
take
up
her
cause
!
''
the
*NL*
Countess
went
on
.
``
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
however
,
that
it
was
much
too
*NL*
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
to
me
,
to
me
--
?
''
And
Isabel
hesitated
as
if
she
had
not
heard
;
as
*NL*
if
her
question
--
though
it
was
sufficiently
there
in
her
eyes
--
were
all
*NL*
for
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
you
he
has
been
faithful
?
Well
,
it
depends
,
my
dear
,
on
what
you
*NL*
call
faithful
.
When
he
married
you
he
was
no
longer
the
lover
of
another
*NL*
woman
--
SUCH
a
lover
as
he
had
been
,
cara
mia
,
between
their
risks
and
*NL*
their
precautions
,
while
the
thing
lasted
!
That
state
of
affairs
had
*NL*
passed
away
;
the
lady
had
repented
,
or
at
all
events
,
for
reasons
of
her
*NL*
own
,
drawn
back
:
she
had
always
had
,
too
,
a
worship
of
appearances
*NL*
so
intense
that
even
Osmond
himself
had
got
bored
with
it
.
You
may
*NL*
therefore
imagine
what
it
was
--
when
he
could
n't
patch
it
on
conveniently
*NL*
to
ANY
of
those
he
goes
in
for
!
But
the
whole
past
was
between
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Isabel
mechanically
echoed
,
``
the
whole
past
is
between
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
this
later
past
is
nothing
.
But
for
six
or
seven
years
,
as
I
say
,
*NL*
they
had
kept
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
a
little
.
``
Why
then
did
she
want
him
to
marry
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
my
dear
,
that
's
her
superiority
!
Because
you
had
money
;
and
because
*NL*
she
believed
you
would
be
good
to
Pansy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
woman
--
and
Pansy
who
does
n't
like
her
!
''
cried
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
reason
she
wanted
some
one
whom
Pansy
would
like

She
knows
*NL*
it
;

knows
everything

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
she
know
that
you
've
told
me
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
depend
upon
whether
you
tell
her

She
's
prepared
for
it
,
and
*NL*
do
you
know
what
she
counts
upon
for
her
defence
?
On
your
believing
that
*NL*
I
lie
.
Perhaps
you
do
;
do
n't
make
yourself
uncomfortable
to
hide
it
.
*NL*
Only
,
as
it
happens
this
time
,
I
do
n't
.
I
've
told
plenty
of
little
*NL*
idiotic
fibs
,
but
they
've
never
hurt
any
one
but
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
sat
staring
at
her
companion
's
story
as
at
a
bale
of
fantastic
*NL*
wares
some
strolling
gypsy
might
have
unpacked
on
the
carpet
at
her
*NL*
feet
.
``
Why
did
Osmond
never
marry
her
?
''
she
finally
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
had
no
money
.
''
The
Countess
had
an
answer
for
everything
,
*NL*
and
if
she
lied
she
lied
well
.
``
No
one
knows
,
no
one
has
ever
known
,
*NL*
what
she
lives
on
,
or
how
she
has
got
all
those
beautiful
things
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
Osmond
himself
knows
.
Besides
,
she
would
n't
have
married
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
she
have
loved
him
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
love
him
in
that
way

She
did
at
first
,
and
then
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
she
would
have
married
him
;
but
at
that
time
her
husband
was
*NL*
living
.
By
the
time
M.
Merle
had
rejoined
--
I
wo
n't
say
his
ancestors
,
*NL*
because
he
never
had
any
--
her
relations
with
Osmond
had
changed
,
and
she
*NL*
had
grown
more
ambitious
.
Besides
,
she
has
never
had
,
about
him
,
''
*NL*
the
Countess
went
on
,
leaving
Isabel
to
wince
for
it
so
tragically
*NL*
afterwards
--
``
she
HAD
never
had
,
what
you
might
call
any
illusions
of
*NL*
INTELLIGENCE
.
She
hoped
she
might
marry
a
great
man
;
that
has
always
*NL*
been
her
idea
.
She
has
waited
and
watched
and
plotted
and
prayed
;
but
*NL*
she
has
never
succeeded
.
I
do
n't
call
Madame
Merle
a
success
,
you
know
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
she
may
accomplish
yet
,
but
at
present
she
has
very
*NL*
little
to
show
.
The
only
tangible
result
she
has
ever
achieved
--
except
,
*NL*
of
course
,
getting
to
know
every
one
and
staying
with
them
free
of
*NL*
expense
--
has
been
her
bringing
you
and
Osmond
together
.
Oh
,
she
did
*NL*
that
,
my
dear
;
you
need
n't
look
as
if
you
doubted
it
.
I
've
watched
*NL*
them
for
years
;
I
know
everything
--
everything
.
I
'm
thought
a
great
*NL*
scatterbrain
,
but
I
've
had
enough
application
of
mind
to
follow
up
those
*NL*
two
.
She
hates
me
,
and
her
way
of
showing
it
is
to
pretend
to
be
for
*NL*
ever
defending
me
.
When
people
say
I
've
had
fifteen
lovers
she
looks
*NL*
horrified
and
declares
that
quite
half
of
them
were
never
proved
.
She
*NL*
has
been
afraid
of
me
for
years
,
and
she
has
taken
great
comfort
in
the
*NL*
vile
,
false
things
people
have
said
about
me
.
She
has
been
afraid
I
'd
*NL*
expose
her
,
and
she
threatened
me
one
day
when
Osmond
began
to
pay
his
*NL*
court
to
you
.
It
was
at
his
house
in
Florence
;
do
you
remember
that
*NL*
afternoon
when
she
brought
you
there
and
we
had
tea
in
the
garden
?
She
*NL*
let
me
know
then
that
if
I
should
tell
tales
two
could
play
at
that
*NL*
game
.
She
pretends
there
's
a
good
deal
more
to
tell
about
me
than
about
*NL*
her
.
It
would
be
an
interesting
comparison
!
I
do
n't
care
a
fig
what
she
*NL*
may
say
,
simply
because
I
know
YOU
do
n't
care
a
fig
.
You
ca
n't
trouble
*NL*
your
head
about
me
less
than
you
do
already
.
So
she
may
take
her
revenge
*NL*
as
she
chooses
;
I
do
n't
think
she
'll
frighten
you
very
much
.
Her
great
*NL*
idea
has
been
to
be
tremendously
irreproachable
--
a
kind
of
full-blown
*NL*
lily
--
the
incarnation
of
propriety
.
She
has
always
worshipped
that
god
.
*NL*
There
should
be
no
scandal
about
Caesar
's
wife
,
you
know
;
and
,
as
I
say
,
*NL*
she
has
always
hoped
to
marry
Caesar
.
That
was
one
reason
she
would
n't
*NL*
marry
Osmond
;
the
fear
that
on
seeing
her
with
Pansy
people
would
put
*NL*
things
together
--
would
even
see
a
resemblance
.
She
has
had
a
terror
*NL*
lest
the
mother
should
betray
herself
.
She
has
been
awfully
careful
;
the
*NL*
mother
has
never
done
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
the
mother
has
done
so
,
''
said
Isabel
,
who
had
listened
to
*NL*
all
this
with
a
face
more
and
more
wan
.
``
She
betrayed
herself
to
me
the
*NL*
other
day
,
though
I
did
n't
recognise
her
.
There
appeared
to
have
been
a
*NL*
chance
of
Pansy
's
making
a
great
marriage
,
and
in
her
disappointment
at
*NL*
its
not
coming
off
she
almost
dropped
the
mask
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
where
she
'd
dish
herself
!
''
cried
the
Countess
.
``
She
has
*NL*
failed
so
dreadfully
that
she
's
determined
her
daughter
shall
make
it
*NL*
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
started
at
the
words
``
her
daughter
,
''
which
her
guest
threw
off
*NL*
so
familiarly
.
``
It
seems
very
wonderful
,
''
she
murmured
;
and
in
this
*NL*
bewildering
impression
she
had
almost
lost
her
sense
of
being
personally
*NL*
touched
by
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
do
n't
go
and
turn
against
the
poor
innocent
child
!
''
the
Countess
*NL*
went
on
.
``
She
's
very
nice
,
in
spite
of
her
deplorable
origin
.
I
myself
*NL*
have
liked
Pansy
;
not
,
naturally
,
because
she
was
hers
,
but
because
she
*NL*
had
become
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
has
become
mine
.
And
how
the
poor
woman
must
have
suffered
at
*NL*
seeing
me
--
!
''
Isabel
exclaimed
while
she
flushed
at
the
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
she
has
suffered
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
has
enjoyed
.
*NL*
Osmond
's
marriage
has
given
his
daughter
a
great
little
lift
.
Before
*NL*
that
she
lived
in
a
hole
.
And
do
you
know
what
the
mother
thought
?
That
*NL*
you
might
take
such
a
fancy
to
the
child
that
you
'd
do
something
for
*NL*
her
.
Osmond
of
course
could
never
give
her
a
portion
.
Osmond
was
really
*NL*
extremely
poor
;
but
of
course
you
know
all
about
that
.
Ah
,
my
dear
,
''
*NL*
cried
the
Countess
,
``
why
did
you
ever
inherit
money
?
''
She
stopped
a
*NL*
moment
as
if
she
saw
something
singular
in
Isabel
's
face
.
``
Do
n't
tell
*NL*
me
now
that
you
'll
give
her
a
dot
.
You
're
capable
of
that
,
but
I
would
*NL*
refuse
to
believe
it
.
Do
n't
try
to
be
too
good
.
Be
a
little
easy
and
*NL*
natural
and
nasty
;
feel
a
little
wicked
,
for
the
comfort
of
it
,
once
in
*NL*
your
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
strange
.
I
suppose
I
ought
to
know
,
but
I
'm
sorry
,
''
Isabel
*NL*
said
.
``
I
'm
much
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
seem
to
be
!
''
cried
the
Countess
with
a
mocking
laugh
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
are
--
perhaps
you
're
not
.
You
do
n't
take
it
as
I
should
have
*NL*
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
I
take
it
?
''
Isabel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
should
say
as
a
woman
who
has
been
made
use
of
.
''
Isabel
made
*NL*
no
answer
to
this
;
she
only
listened
,
and
the
Countess
went
on
.
``
They
've
*NL*
always
been
bound
to
each
other
;
they
remained
so
even
after
she
broke
*NL*
off
--
or
HE
did
.
But
he
has
always
been
more
for
her
than
she
has
been
*NL*
for
him
.
When
their
little
carnival
was
over
they
made
a
bargain
that
*NL*
each
should
give
the
other
complete
liberty
,
but
that
each
should
also
*NL*
do
everything
possible
to
help
the
other
on
.
You
may
ask
me
how
I
know
*NL*
such
a
thing
as
that
.
I
know
it
by
the
way
they
've
behaved
.
Now
see
how
*NL*
much
better
women
are
than
men
!
She
has
found
a
wife
for
Osmond
,
but
*NL*
Osmond
has
never
lifted
a
little
finger
for
HER
.
She
has
worked
for
him
,
*NL*
plotted
for
him
,
suffered
for
him
;
she
has
even
more
than
once
found
*NL*
money
for
him
;
and
the
end
of
it
is
that
he
's
tired
of
her
.
She
's
an
old
*NL*
habit
;
there
are
moments
when
he
needs
her
,
but
on
the
whole
he
would
n't
*NL*
miss
her
if
she
were
removed
.
And
,
what
's
more
,
today
she
knows
it
.
So
*NL*
you
need
n't
be
jealous
!
''
the
Countess
added
humorously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
rose
from
her
sofa
again
;
she
felt
bruised
and
scant
of
breath
;
*NL*
her
head
was
humming
with
new
knowledge
.
``
I
'm
much
obliged
to
you
,
''
she
*NL*
repeated
.
And
then
she
added
abruptly
,
in
quite
a
different
tone
:
``
How
*NL*
do
you
know
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
enquiry
appeared
to
ruffle
the
Countess
more
than
Isabel
's
*NL*
expression
of
gratitude
pleased
her
.
She
gave
her
companion
a
bold
*NL*
stare
,
with
which
,
``
Let
us
assume
that
I
've
invented
it
!
''
she
cried
.
She
*NL*
too
,
however
,
suddenly
changed
her
tone
and
,
laying
her
hand
on
Isabel
's
*NL*
arm
,
said
with
the
penetration
of
her
sharp
bright
smile
:
``
Now
will
you
*NL*
give
up
your
journey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
started
a
little
;
she
turned
away
.
But
she
felt
weak
and
in
a
*NL*
moment
had
to
lay
her
arm
upon
the
mantel-shelf
for
support
.
She
stood
a
*NL*
minute
so
,
and
then
upon
her
arm
she
dropped
her
dizzy
head
,
with
closed
*NL*
eyes
and
pale
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
done
wrong
to
speak
--
I
've
made
you
ill
!
''
the
Countess
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
must
see
Ralph
!
''
Isabel
wailed
;
not
in
resentment
,
not
in
*NL*
the
quick
passion
her
companion
had
looked
for
;
but
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
far-reaching
,
infinite
sadness
.

CHAPTER
LII
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
train
for
Turin
and
Paris
that
evening
;
and
after
the
*NL*
Countess
had
left
her
Isabel
had
a
rapid
and
decisive
conference
with
*NL*
her
maid
,
who
was
discreet
,
devoted
and
active
.
After
this
she
thought
*NL*
-LRB-
except
of
her
journey
-RRB-
only
of
one
thing
.
She
must
go
and
see
Pansy
;
*NL*
from
her
she
could
n't
turn
away
.
She
had
not
seen
her
yet
,
as
Osmond
had
*NL*
given
her
to
understand
that
it
was
too
soon
to
begin
.
She
drove
at
five
*NL*
o'clock
to
a
high
floor
in
a
narrow
street
in
the
quarter
of
the
Piazza
*NL*
Navona
,
and
was
admitted
by
the
portress
of
the
convent
,
a
genial
and
*NL*
obsequious
person
.
Isabel
had
been
at
this
institution
before
;
she
had
*NL*
come
with
Pansy
to
see
the
sisters
.
She
knew
they
were
good
women
,
*NL*
and
she
saw
that
the
large
rooms
were
clean
and
cheerful
and
that
*NL*
the
well-used
garden
had
sun
for
winter
and
shade
for
spring
.
But
she
*NL*
disliked
the
place
,
which
affronted
and
almost
frightened
her
;
not
for
*NL*
the
world
would
she
have
spent
a
night
there
.
It
produced
to-day
more
*NL*
than
before
the
impression
of
a
well-appointed
prison
;
for
it
was
not
*NL*
possible
to
pretend
Pansy
was
free
to
leave
it
.
This
innocent
creature
*NL*
had
been
presented
to
her
in
a
new
and
violent
light
,
but
the
secondary
*NL*
effect
of
the
revelation
was
to
make
her
reach
out
a
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
portress
left
her
to
wait
in
the
parlour
of
the
convent
while
she
*NL*
went
to
make
it
known
that
there
was
a
visitor
for
the
dear
young
lady
.
*NL*
The
parlour
was
a
vast
,
cold
apartment
,
with
new-looking
furniture
;
a
*NL*
large
clean
stove
of
white
porcelain
,
unlighted
,
a
collection
of
wax
*NL*
flowers
under
glass
,
and
a
series
of
engravings
from
religious
pictures
*NL*
on
the
walls
.
On
the
other
occasion
Isabel
had
thought
it
less
like
Rome
*NL*
than
like
Philadelphia
,
but
to-day
she
made
no
reflexions
;
the
apartment
*NL*
only
seemed
to
her
very
empty
and
very
soundless
.
The
portress
returned
*NL*
at
the
end
of
some
five
minutes
,
ushering
in
another
person
.
Isabel
got
*NL*
up
,
expecting
to
see
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
sisterhood
,
but
to
her
*NL*
extreme
surprise
found
herself
confronted
with
Madame
Merle
.
The
effect
*NL*
was
strange
,
for
Madame
Merle
was
already
so
present
to
her
vision
*NL*
that
her
appearance
in
the
flesh
was
like
suddenly
,
and
rather
awfully
,
*NL*
seeing
a
painted
picture
move
.
Isabel
had
been
thinking
all
day
of
her
*NL*
falsity
,
her
audacity
,
her
ability
,
her
probable
suffering
;
and
these
*NL*
dark
things
seemed
to
flash
with
a
sudden
light
as
she
entered
the
*NL*
room
.
Her
being
there
at
all
had
the
character
of
ugly
evidence
,
of
*NL*
handwritings
,
of
profaned
relics
,
of
grim
things
produced
in
court
.
It
*NL*
made
Isabel
feel
faint
;
if
it
had
been
necessary
to
speak
on
the
spot
*NL*
she
would
have
been
quite
unable
.
But
no
such
necessity
was
distinct
to
*NL*
her
;
it
seemed
to
her
indeed
that
she
had
absolutely
nothing
to
say
to
*NL*
Madame
Merle
.
In
one
's
relations
with
this
lady
,
however
,
there
were
*NL*
never
any
absolute
necessities
;
she
had
a
manner
which
carried
off
*NL*
not
only
her
own
deficiencies
but
those
of
other
people
.
But
she
was
*NL*
different
from
usual
;
she
came
in
slowly
,
behind
the
portress
,
and
*NL*
Isabel
instantly
perceived
that
she
was
not
likely
to
depend
upon
her
*NL*
habitual
resources
.
For
her
too
the
occasion
was
exceptional
,
and
she
*NL*
had
undertaken
to
treat
it
by
the
light
of
the
moment
.
This
gave
her
a
*NL*
peculiar
gravity
;
she
pretended
not
even
to
smile
,
and
though
Isabel
saw
*NL*
that
she
was
more
than
ever
playing
a
part
it
seemed
to
her
that
on
the
*NL*
whole
the
wonderful
woman
had
never
been
so
natural
.
She
looked
at
her
*NL*
young
friend
from
head
to
foot
,
but
not
harshly
nor
defiantly
;
with
a
*NL*
cold
gentleness
rather
,
and
an
absence
of
any
air
of
allusion
to
their
*NL*
last
meeting
.
It
was
as
if
she
had
wished
to
mark
a
distinction
.
She
had
*NL*
been
irritated
then
,
she
was
reconciled
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
leave
us
alone
,
''
she
said
to
the
portress
;
``
in
five
minutes
*NL*
this
lady
will
ring
for
you
.
''
And
then
she
turned
to
Isabel
,
who
,
after
*NL*
noting
what
has
just
been
mentioned
,
had
ceased
to
notice
and
had
let
*NL*
her
eyes
wander
as
far
as
the
limits
of
the
room
would
allow
.
She
wished
*NL*
never
to
look
at
Madame
Merle
again
.
``
You
're
surprised
to
find
me
here
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
afraid
you
're
not
pleased
,
''
this
lady
went
on
.
``
You
do
n't
see
*NL*
why
I
should
have
come
;
it
's
as
if
I
had
anticipated
you
.
I
confess
I
've
*NL*
been
rather
indiscreet
--
I
ought
to
have
asked
your
permission
.
''
There
*NL*
was
none
of
the
oblique
movement
of
irony
in
this
;
it
was
said
simply
*NL*
and
mildly
;
but
Isabel
,
far
afloat
on
a
sea
of
wonder
and
pain
,
could
*NL*
not
have
told
herself
with
what
intention
it
was
uttered
.
``
But
I
've
not
*NL*
been
sitting
long
,
''
Madame
Merle
continued
;
``
that
is
I
've
not
been
long
*NL*
with
Pansy
.
I
came
to
see
her
because
it
occurred
to
me
this
afternoon
*NL*
that
she
must
be
rather
lonely
and
perhaps
even
a
little
miserable
.
*NL*
It
may
be
good
for
a
small
girl
;
I
know
so
little
about
small
girls
;
I
*NL*
ca
n't
tell
.
At
any
rate
it
's
a
little
dismal
.
Therefore
I
came
--
on
the
*NL*
chance
.
I
knew
of
course
that
you
'd
come
,
and
her
father
as
well
;
*NL*
still
,
I
had
not
been
told
other
visitors
were
forbidden
.
The
good
*NL*
woman
--
what
's
her
name
?
Madame
Catherine
--
made
no
objection
whatever
.
I
*NL*
stayed
twenty
minutes
with
Pansy
;
she
has
a
charming
little
room
,
not
*NL*
in
the
least
conventual
,
with
a
piano
and
flowers
.
She
has
arranged
*NL*
it
delightfully
;
she
has
so
much
taste
.
Of
course
it
's
all
none
of
my
*NL*
business
,
but
I
feel
happier
since
I
've
seen
her
.
She
may
even
have
a
*NL*
maid
if
she
likes
;
but
of
course
she
has
no
occasion
to
dress
.
She
wears
*NL*
a
little
black
frock
;
she
looks
so
charming
.
I
went
afterwards
to
see
*NL*
Mother
Catherine
,
who
has
a
very
good
room
too
;
I
assure
you
I
do
n't
*NL*
find
the
poor
sisters
at
all
monastic
.
Mother
Catherine
has
a
most
*NL*
coquettish
little
toilet-table
,
with
something
that
looked
uncommonly
*NL*
like
a
bottle
of
eau-de-Cologne
.
She
speaks
delightfully
of
Pansy
;
says
*NL*
it
's
a
great
happiness
for
them
to
have
her
.
She
's
a
little
saint
of
*NL*
heaven
and
a
model
to
the
oldest
of
them
.
Just
as
I
was
leaving
Madame
*NL*
Catherine
the
portress
came
to
say
to
her
that
there
was
a
lady
for
the
*NL*
signorina
.
Of
course
I
knew
it
must
be
you
,
and
I
asked
her
to
let
me
*NL*
go
and
receive
you
in
her
place
.
She
demurred
greatly
--
I
must
tell
you
*NL*
that
--
and
said
it
was
her
duty
to
notify
the
Mother
Superior
;
it
was
*NL*
of
such
high
importance
that
you
should
be
treated
with
respect
.
I
*NL*
requested
her
to
let
the
Mother
Superior
alone
and
asked
her
how
she
*NL*
supposed
I
would
treat
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Madame
Merle
went
on
,
with
much
of
the
brilliancy
of
a
woman
who
had
*NL*
long
been
a
mistress
of
the
art
of
conversation
.
But
there
were
phases
*NL*
and
gradations
in
her
speech
,
not
one
of
which
was
lost
upon
Isabel
's
*NL*
ear
,
though
her
eyes
were
absent
from
her
companion
's
face
.
She
had
not
*NL*
proceeded
far
before
Isabel
noted
a
sudden
break
in
her
voice
,
a
lapse
*NL*
in
her
continuity
,
which
was
in
itself
a
complete
drama
.
This
subtle
*NL*
modulation
marked
a
momentous
discovery
--
the
perception
of
an
entirely
*NL*
new
attitude
on
the
part
of
her
listener
.
Madame
Merle
had
guessed
in
*NL*
the
space
of
an
instant
that
everything
was
at
end
between
them
,
and
in
*NL*
the
space
of
another
instant
she
had
guessed
the
reason
why
.
The
person
*NL*
who
stood
there
was
not
the
same
one
she
had
seen
hitherto
,
but
was
a
*NL*
very
different
person
--
a
person
who
knew
her
secret
.
This
discovery
was
*NL*
tremendous
,
and
from
the
moment
she
made
it
the
most
accomplished
of
*NL*
women
faltered
and
lost
her
courage
.
But
only
for
that
moment
.
Then
the
*NL*
conscious
stream
of
her
perfect
manner
gathered
itself
again
and
flowed
*NL*
on
as
smoothly
as
might
be
to
the
end
.
But
it
was
only
because
she
had
*NL*
the
end
in
view
that
she
was
able
to
proceed
.
She
had
been
touched
with
*NL*
a
point
that
made
her
quiver
,
and
she
needed
all
the
alertness
of
her
*NL*
will
to
repress
her
agitation
.
Her
only
safety
was
in
her
not
betraying
*NL*
herself
.
She
resisted
this
,
but
the
startled
quality
of
her
voice
*NL*
refused
to
improve
--
she
could
n't
help
it
--
while
she
heard
herself
say
*NL*
she
hardly
knew
what
.
The
tide
of
her
confidence
ebbed
,
and
she
was
able
*NL*
only
just
to
glide
into
port
,
faintly
grazing
the
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
saw
it
all
as
distinctly
as
if
it
had
been
reflected
in
a
large
*NL*
clear
glass
.
It
might
have
been
a
great
moment
for
her
,
for
it
might
*NL*
have
been
a
moment
of
triumph
.
That
Madame
Merle
had
lost
her
pluck
and
*NL*
saw
before
her
the
phantom
of
exposure
--
this
in
itself
was
a
revenge
,
*NL*
this
in
itself
was
almost
the
promise
of
a
brighter
day
.
And
for
a
*NL*
moment
during
which
she
stood
apparently
looking
out
of
the
window
,
with
*NL*
her
back
half-turned
,
Isabel
enjoyed
that
knowledge
.
On
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
window
lay
the
garden
of
the
convent
;
but
this
is
not
what
she
*NL*
saw
;
she
saw
nothing
of
the
budding
plants
and
the
glowing
afternoon
.
*NL*
She
saw
,
in
the
crude
light
of
that
revelation
which
had
already
become
*NL*
a
part
of
experience
and
to
which
the
very
frailty
of
the
vessel
in
*NL*
which
it
had
been
offered
her
only
gave
an
intrinsic
price
,
the
dry
*NL*
staring
fact
that
she
had
been
an
applied
handled
hung-up
tool
,
*NL*
as
senseless
and
convenient
as
mere
shaped
wood
and
iron
.
All
the
*NL*
bitterness
of
this
knowledge
surged
into
her
soul
again
;
it
was
as
if
*NL*
she
felt
on
her
lips
the
taste
of
dishonour
.
There
was
a
moment
during
*NL*
which
,
if
she
had
turned
and
spoken
,
she
would
have
said
something
that
*NL*
would
hiss
like
a
lash
.
But
she
closed
her
eyes
,
and
then
the
hideous
*NL*
vision
dropped
.
What
remained
was
the
cleverest
woman
in
the
world
*NL*
standing
there
within
a
few
feet
of
her
and
knowing
as
little
what
to
*NL*
think
as
the
meanest
.
Isabel
's
only
revenge
was
to
be
silent
still
--
to
*NL*
leave
Madame
Merle
in
this
unprecedented
situation
.
She
left
her
there
*NL*
for
a
period
that
must
have
seemed
long
to
this
lady
,
who
at
last
*NL*
seated
herself
with
a
movement
which
was
in
itself
a
confession
of
*NL*
helplessness
.
Then
Isabel
turned
slow
eyes
,
looking
down
at
her
.
Madame
*NL*
Merle
was
very
pale
;
her
own
eyes
covered
Isabel
's
face
.
She
might
see
*NL*
what
she
would
,
but
her
danger
was
over
.
Isabel
would
never
accuse
*NL*
her
,
never
reproach
her
;
perhaps
because
she
never
would
give
her
the
*NL*
opportunity
to
defend
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
come
to
bid
Pansy
good-bye
,
''
our
young
woman
said
at
last
.
``
I
go
to
*NL*
England
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
England
to-night
!
''
Madame
Merle
repeated
sitting
there
and
*NL*
looking
up
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
Gardencourt
.
Ralph
Touchett
's
dying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
'll
feel
that
.
''
Madame
Merle
recovered
herself
;
she
had
a
chance
*NL*
to
express
sympathy
.
``
Do
you
go
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
without
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
gave
a
low
vague
murmur
;
a
sort
of
recognition
of
the
*NL*
general
sadness
of
things
.
``
Mr.
Touchett
never
liked
me
,
but
I
'm
sorry
*NL*
he
's
dying
.
Shall
you
see
his
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
she
has
returned
from
America
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
used
to
be
very
kind
to
me
;
but
she
has
changed
.
Others
too
have
*NL*
changed
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
with
a
quiet
noble
pathos
.
She
paused
a
*NL*
moment
,
then
added
:
``
And
you
'll
see
dear
old
Gardencourt
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
enjoy
it
much
,
''
Isabel
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally
--
in
your
grief
.
But
it
's
on
the
whole
,
of
all
the
houses
I
*NL*
know
,
and
I
know
many
,
the
one
I
should
have
liked
best
to
live
in
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
venture
to
send
a
message
to
the
people
,
''
Madame
Merle
added
;
``
but
*NL*
I
should
like
to
give
my
love
to
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
turned
away
.
``
I
had
better
go
to
Pansy
.
I
've
not
much
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
looked
about
her
for
the
proper
egress
,
the
door
opened
and
*NL*
admitted
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
house
,
who
advanced
with
a
discreet
*NL*
smile
,
gently
rubbing
,
under
her
long
loose
sleeves
,
a
pair
of
plump
*NL*
white
hands
.
Isabel
recognised
Madame
Catherine
,
whose
acquaintance
she
*NL*
had
already
made
,
and
begged
that
she
would
immediately
let
her
see
Miss
*NL*
Osmond
.
Madame
Catherine
looked
doubly
discreet
,
but
smiled
very
blandly
*NL*
and
said
:
``
It
will
be
good
for
her
to
see
you
.
I
'll
take
you
to
her
*NL*
myself
.
''
Then
she
directed
her
pleased
guarded
vision
to
Madame
Merle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
let
me
remain
a
little
?
''
this
lady
asked
.
``
It
's
so
good
to
be
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
remain
always
if
you
like
!
''
And
the
good
sister
gave
a
knowing
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
led
Isabel
out
of
the
room
,
through
several
corridors
,
and
up
a
long
*NL*
staircase
.
All
these
departments
were
solid
and
bare
,
light
and
clean
;
*NL*
so
,
thought
Isabel
,
are
the
great
penal
establishments
.
Madame
Catherine
*NL*
gently
pushed
open
the
door
of
Pansy
's
room
and
ushered
in
the
visitor
;
*NL*
then
stood
smiling
with
folded
hands
while
the
two
others
met
and
*NL*
embraced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
glad
to
see
you
,
''
she
repeated
;
``
it
will
do
her
good
.
''
And
she
*NL*
placed
the
best
chair
carefully
for
Isabel
.
But
she
made
no
movement
*NL*
to
seat
herself
;
she
seemed
ready
to
retire
.
``
How
does
this
dear
child
*NL*
look
?
''
she
asked
of
Isabel
,
lingering
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
looks
pale
,
''
Isabel
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
.
She
's
very
happy
.
Elle
eclaire
la
*NL*
maison
,
''
said
the
good
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
wore
,
as
Madame
Merle
had
said
,
a
little
black
dress
;
it
was
*NL*
perhaps
this
that
made
her
look
pale
.
``
They
're
very
good
to
me
--
they
*NL*
think
of
everything
!
''
she
exclaimed
with
all
her
customary
eagerness
to
*NL*
accommodate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
think
of
you
always
--
you
're
a
precious
charge
,
''
Madame
Catherine
*NL*
remarked
in
the
tone
of
a
woman
with
whom
benevolence
was
a
habit
and
*NL*
whose
conception
of
duty
was
the
acceptance
of
every
care
.
It
fell
with
*NL*
a
leaden
weight
on
Isabel
's
ears
;
it
seemed
to
represent
the
surrender
*NL*
of
a
personality
,
the
authority
of
the
Church
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Madame
Catherine
had
left
them
together
Pansy
kneeled
down
and
hid
*NL*
her
head
in
her
stepmother
's
lap
.
So
she
remained
some
moments
,
while
*NL*
Isabel
gently
stroked
her
hair
.
Then
she
got
up
,
averting
her
face
and
*NL*
looking
about
the
room
.
``
Do
n't
you
think
I
've
arranged
it
well
?
I
've
*NL*
everything
I
have
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
pretty
;
you
're
very
comfortable
.
''
Isabel
scarcely
knew
what
*NL*
she
could
say
to
her
.
On
the
one
hand
she
could
n't
let
her
think
she
had
*NL*
come
to
pity
her
,
and
on
the
other
it
would
be
a
dull
mockery
to
pretend
*NL*
to
rejoice
with
her
.
So
she
simply
added
after
a
moment
:
``
I
've
come
to
*NL*
bid
you
good-bye
.
I
'm
going
to
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
's
white
little
face
turned
red
.
``
To
England
!
Not
to
come
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
when
I
shall
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
'm
sorry
,
''
Pansy
breathed
with
faintness
.
She
spoke
as
if
she
had
*NL*
no
right
to
criticise
;
but
her
tone
expressed
a
depth
of
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cousin
,
Mr.
Touchett
,
is
very
ill
;
he
'll
probably
die
.
I
wish
to
see
*NL*
him
,
''
Isabel
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
;
you
told
me
he
would
die
.
Of
course
you
must
go
.
And
will
papa
*NL*
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
shall
go
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
the
girl
said
nothing
.
Isabel
had
often
wondered
what
she
*NL*
thought
of
the
apparent
relations
of
her
father
with
his
wife
;
but
never
*NL*
by
a
glance
,
by
an
intimation
,
had
she
let
it
be
seen
that
she
deemed
*NL*
them
deficient
in
an
air
of
intimacy
.
She
made
her
reflexions
,
Isabel
*NL*
was
sure
;
and
she
must
have
had
a
conviction
that
there
were
husbands
*NL*
and
wives
who
were
more
intimate
than
that
.
But
Pansy
was
not
indiscreet
*NL*
even
in
thought
;
she
would
as
little
have
ventured
to
judge
her
gentle
*NL*
stepmother
as
to
criticise
her
magnificent
father
.
Her
heart
may
have
*NL*
stood
almost
as
still
as
it
would
have
done
had
she
seen
two
of
the
*NL*
saints
in
the
great
picture
in
the
convent
chapel
turn
their
painted
*NL*
heads
and
shake
them
at
each
other
.
But
as
in
this
latter
case
she
would
*NL*
-LRB-
for
very
solemnity
's
sake
-RRB-
never
have
mentioned
the
awful
phenomenon
,
*NL*
so
she
put
away
all
knowledge
of
the
secrets
of
larger
lives
than
her
*NL*
own
.
``
You
'll
be
very
far
away
,
''
she
presently
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
shall
be
far
away
.
But
it
will
scarcely
matter
,
''
Isabel
*NL*
explained
;
``
since
so
long
as
you
're
here
I
ca
n't
be
called
near
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
you
can
come
and
see
me
;
though
you
've
not
come
very
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
come
because
your
father
forbade
it
.
To-day
I
bring
nothing
*NL*
with
me
.
I
ca
n't
amuse
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
to
be
amused
.
That
's
not
what
papa
wishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
hardly
matters
whether
I
'm
in
Rome
or
in
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
happy
,
Mrs.
Osmond
,
''
said
Pansy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
.
But
it
does
n't
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
say
to
myself
.
What
does
it
matter
?
But
I
should
like
to
*NL*
come
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
indeed
you
might
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
leave
me
here
,
''
Pansy
went
on
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
said
nothing
for
a
minute
;
her
heart
beat
fast
.
``
Will
you
come
*NL*
away
with
me
now
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
looked
at
her
pleadingly
.
``
Did
papa
tell
you
to
bring
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
it
's
my
own
proposal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
had
better
wait
then
.
Did
papa
send
me
no
message
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
he
knew
I
was
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks
I
've
not
had
enough
,
''
said
Pansy
.
``
But
I
have
.
The
ladies
are
*NL*
very
kind
to
me
and
the
little
girls
come
to
see
me
.
There
are
some
*NL*
very
little
ones
--
such
charming
children
.
Then
my
room
--
you
can
see
for
*NL*
yourself
.
All
that
's
very
delightful
.
But
I
've
had
enough
.
Papa
wished
*NL*
me
to
think
a
little
--
and
I
've
thought
a
great
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
thought
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
I
must
never
displease
papa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew
that
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
know
it
better
.
I
'll
do
anything
--
I
'll
do
anything
,
''
said
*NL*
Pansy
.
Then
,
as
she
heard
her
own
words
,
a
deep
,
pure
blush
came
into
*NL*
her
face
.
Isabel
read
the
meaning
of
it
;
she
saw
the
poor
girl
had
been
*NL*
vanquished
.
It
was
well
that
Mr.
Edward
Rosier
had
kept
his
enamels
!
*NL*
Isabel
looked
into
her
eyes
and
saw
there
mainly
a
prayer
to
be
treated
*NL*
easily
.
She
laid
her
hand
on
Pansy
's
as
if
to
let
her
know
that
her
*NL*
look
conveyed
no
diminution
of
esteem
;
for
the
collapse
of
the
girl
's
*NL*
momentary
resistance
-LRB-
mute
and
modest
thought
it
had
been
-RRB-
seemed
only
*NL*
her
tribute
to
the
truth
of
things
.
She
did
n't
presume
to
judge
others
,
*NL*
but
she
had
judged
herself
;
she
had
seen
the
reality
.
She
had
no
*NL*
vocation
for
struggling
with
combinations
;
in
the
solemnity
of
*NL*
sequestration
there
was
something
that
overwhelmed
her
.
She
bowed
her
*NL*
pretty
head
to
authority
and
only
asked
of
authority
to
be
merciful
.
*NL*
Yes
;
it
was
very
well
that
Edward
Rosier
had
reserved
a
few
articles
!
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
got
up
;
her
time
was
rapidly
shortening
.
``
Good-bye
then
.
I
leave
*NL*
Rome
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
took
hold
of
her
dress
;
there
was
a
sudden
change
in
the
child
's
*NL*
face
.
``
You
look
strange
,
you
frighten
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
very
harmless
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
wo
n't
come
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
.
I
ca
n't
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Mrs.
Osmond
,
you
wo
n't
leave
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
now
saw
she
had
guessed
everything
.
``
My
dear
child
,
what
can
I
do
*NL*
for
you
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
but
I
'm
happier
when
I
think
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
always
think
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
when
you
're
so
far
.
I
'm
a
little
afraid
,
''
said
Pansy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
afraid
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
papa
--
a
little
.
And
of
Madame
Merle
.
She
has
just
been
to
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
say
that
,
''
Isabel
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'll
do
everything
they
want
.
Only
if
you
're
here
I
shall
do
it
*NL*
more
easily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
considered
.
``
I
wo
n't
desert
you
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
``
Good-bye
,
my
*NL*
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
held
each
other
a
moment
in
a
silent
embrace
,
like
two
*NL*
sisters
;
and
afterwards
Pansy
walked
along
the
corridor
with
her
visitor
*NL*
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
.
``
Madame
Merle
has
been
here
,
''
she
remarked
*NL*
as
they
went
;
and
as
Isabel
answered
nothing
she
added
abruptly
:
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
Madame
Merle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
hesitated
,
then
stopped
.
``
You
must
never
say
that
--
that
you
do
n't
*NL*
like
Madame
Merle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pansy
looked
at
her
in
wonder
;
but
wonder
with
Pansy
had
never
been
a
*NL*
reason
for
non-compliance
.
``
I
never
will
again
,
''
she
said
with
exquisite
*NL*
gentleness
.
At
the
top
of
the
staircase
they
had
to
separate
,
as
it
*NL*
appeared
to
be
part
of
the
mild
but
very
definite
discipline
under
which
*NL*
Pansy
lived
that
she
should
not
go
down
.
Isabel
descended
,
and
when
she
*NL*
reached
the
bottom
the
girl
was
standing
above
.
``
You
'll
come
back
?
''
she
*NL*
called
out
in
a
voice
that
Isabel
remembered
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
'll
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Catherine
met
Mrs.
Osmond
below
and
conducted
her
to
the
door
of
*NL*
the
parlour
,
outside
of
which
the
two
stood
talking
a
minute
.
``
I
wo
n't
*NL*
go
in
,
''
said
the
good
sister
.
``
Madame
Merle
's
waiting
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
announcement
Isabel
stiffened
;
she
was
on
the
point
of
asking
*NL*
if
there
were
no
other
egress
from
the
convent
.
But
a
moment
's
reflexion
*NL*
assured
her
that
she
would
do
well
not
to
betray
to
the
worthy
nun
her
*NL*
desire
to
avoid
Pansy
's
other
friend
.
Her
companion
grasped
her
arm
*NL*
very
gently
and
,
fixing
her
a
moment
with
wise
,
benevolent
eyes
,
said
*NL*
in
French
and
almost
familiarly
:
``
Eh
bien
,
chere
Madame
,
qu'en
*NL*
pensez-vous
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
my
step-daughter
?
Oh
,
it
would
take
long
to
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
think
it
's
enough
,
''
Madame
Catherine
distinctly
observed
.
And
she
*NL*
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
parlour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
was
sitting
just
as
Isabel
had
left
her
,
like
a
woman
so
*NL*
absorbed
in
thought
that
she
had
not
moved
a
little
finger
.
As
Madame
*NL*
Catherine
closed
the
door
she
got
up
,
and
Isabel
saw
that
she
had
been
*NL*
thinking
to
some
purpose
.
She
had
recovered
her
balance
;
she
was
in
full
*NL*
possession
of
her
resources
.
``
I
found
I
wished
to
wait
for
you
,
''
she
*NL*
said
urbanely
.
``
But
it
's
not
to
talk
about
Pansy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
wondered
what
it
could
be
to
talk
about
,
and
in
spite
of
Madame
*NL*
Merle
's
declaration
she
answered
after
a
moment
:
``
Madame
Catherine
says
*NL*
it
's
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
also
seems
to
me
enough
.
I
wanted
to
ask
you
another
word
about
*NL*
poor
Mr.
Touchett
,
''
Madame
Merle
added
.
``
Have
you
reason
to
believe
that
*NL*
he
's
really
at
his
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
information
but
a
telegram
.
Unfortunately
it
only
confirms
a
*NL*
probability
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
ask
you
a
strange
question
,
''
said
Madame
Merle
.
``
Are
*NL*
you
very
fond
of
your
cousin
?
''
And
she
gave
a
smile
as
strange
as
her
*NL*
utterance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
very
fond
of
him
.
But
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
just
hung
fire
.
``
It
's
rather
hard
to
explain
.
Something
has
occurred
*NL*
to
me
which
may
not
have
occurred
to
you
,
and
I
give
you
the
benefit
*NL*
of
my
idea
.
Your
cousin
did
you
once
a
great
service
.
Have
you
never
*NL*
guessed
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
done
me
many
services
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
one
was
much
above
the
rest
.
He
made
you
a
rich
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
HE
made
me
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
appearing
to
see
herself
successful
,
she
went
on
more
*NL*
triumphantly
:
``
He
imparted
to
you
that
extra
lustre
which
was
required
*NL*
to
make
you
a
brilliant
match
.
At
bottom
it
's
him
you
've
to
thank
.
''
She
*NL*
stopped
;
there
was
something
in
Isabel
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
It
was
my
uncle
's
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
was
your
uncle
's
money
,
but
it
was
your
cousin
's
idea
.
He
*NL*
brought
his
father
over
to
it
.
Ah
,
my
dear
,
the
sum
was
large
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
stood
staring
;
she
seemed
to-day
to
live
in
a
world
illumined
by
*NL*
lurid
flashes
.
``
I
do
n't
know
why
you
say
such
things
.
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
but
what
I
've
guessed
.
But
I
've
guessed
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
went
to
the
door
and
,
when
she
had
opened
it
,
stood
a
moment
*NL*
with
her
hand
on
the
latch
.
Then
she
said
--
it
was
her
only
revenge
:
``
I
*NL*
believed
it
was
you
I
had
to
thank
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
dropped
her
eyes
;
she
stood
there
in
a
kind
of
proud
*NL*
penance
.
``
You
're
very
unhappy
,
I
know
.
But
I
'm
more
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
can
believe
that
.
I
think
I
should
like
never
to
see
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Merle
raised
her
eyes
.
``
I
shall
go
to
America
,
''
she
quietly
*NL*
remarked
while
Isabel
passed
out
.

CHAPTER
LIII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
with
surprise
,
it
was
with
a
feeling
which
in
other
*NL*
circumstances
would
have
had
much
of
the
effect
of
joy
,
that
as
Isabel
*NL*
descended
from
the
Paris
Mail
at
Charing
Cross
she
stepped
into
the
*NL*
arms
,
as
it
were
--
or
at
any
rate
into
the
hands
--
of
Henrietta
Stackpole
.
*NL*
She
had
telegraphed
to
her
friend
from
Turin
,
and
though
she
had
not
*NL*
definitely
said
to
herself
that
Henrietta
would
meet
her
,
she
had
felt
*NL*
her
telegram
would
produce
some
helpful
result
.
On
her
long
journey
from
*NL*
Rome
her
mind
had
been
given
up
to
vagueness
;
she
was
unable
to
question
*NL*
the
future
.
She
performed
this
journey
with
sightless
eyes
and
took
*NL*
little
pleasure
in
the
countries
she
traversed
,
decked
out
though
they
*NL*
were
in
the
richest
freshness
of
spring
.
Her
thoughts
followed
their
*NL*
course
through
other
countries
--
strange-looking
,
dimly-lighted
,
pathless
*NL*
lands
,
in
which
there
was
no
change
of
seasons
,
but
only
,
as
it
seemed
,
*NL*
a
perpetual
dreariness
of
winter
.
She
had
plenty
to
think
about
;
but
*NL*
it
was
neither
reflexion
nor
conscious
purpose
that
filled
her
mind
.
*NL*
Disconnected
visions
passed
through
it
,
and
sudden
dull
gleams
of
*NL*
memory
,
of
expectation
.
The
past
and
the
future
came
and
went
at
their
*NL*
will
,
but
she
saw
them
only
in
fitful
images
,
which
rose
and
fell
by
a
*NL*
logic
of
their
own
.
It
was
extraordinary
the
things
she
remembered
.
Now
*NL*
that
she
was
in
the
secret
,
now
that
she
knew
something
that
so
much
*NL*
concerned
her
and
the
eclipse
of
which
had
made
life
resemble
an
attempt
*NL*
to
play
whist
with
an
imperfect
pack
of
cards
,
the
truth
of
things
,
*NL*
their
mutual
relations
,
their
meaning
,
and
for
the
most
part
their
*NL*
horror
,
rose
before
her
with
a
kind
of
architectural
vastness
.
She
*NL*
remembered
a
thousand
trifles
;
they
started
to
life
with
the
spontaneity
*NL*
of
a
shiver
.
She
had
thought
them
trifles
at
the
time
;
now
she
saw
that
*NL*
they
had
been
weighted
with
lead
.
Yet
even
now
they
were
trifles
after
*NL*
all
,
for
of
what
use
was
it
to
her
to
understand
them
?
Nothing
seemed
of
*NL*
use
to
her
to-day
.
All
purpose
,
all
intention
,
was
suspended
;
all
*NL*
desire
too
save
the
single
desire
to
reach
her
much-embracing
refuge
.
*NL*
Gardencourt
had
been
her
starting-point
,
and
to
those
muffled
chambers
*NL*
it
was
at
least
a
temporary
solution
to
return
.
She
had
gone
forth
in
*NL*
her
strength
;
she
would
come
back
in
her
weakness
,
and
if
the
place
had
*NL*
been
a
rest
to
her
before
,
it
would
be
a
sanctuary
now
.
She
envied
Ralph
*NL*
his
dying
,
for
if
one
were
thinking
of
rest
that
was
the
most
perfect
*NL*
of
all
.
To
cease
utterly
,
to
give
it
all
up
and
not
know
anything
*NL*
more
--
this
idea
was
as
sweet
as
the
vision
of
a
cool
bath
in
a
marble
*NL*
tank
,
in
a
darkened
chamber
,
in
a
hot
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
moments
indeed
in
her
journey
from
Rome
which
were
almost
as
*NL*
good
as
being
dead
.
She
sat
in
her
corner
,
so
motionless
,
so
passive
,
*NL*
simply
with
the
sense
of
being
carried
,
so
detached
from
hope
and
*NL*
regret
,
that
she
recalled
to
herself
one
of
those
Etruscan
figures
*NL*
couched
upon
the
receptacle
of
their
ashes
.
There
was
nothing
to
regret
*NL*
now
--
that
was
all
over
.
Not
only
the
time
of
her
folly
,
but
the
time
of
*NL*
her
repentance
was
far
.
The
only
thing
to
regret
was
that
Madame
Merle
*NL*
had
been
so
--
well
,
so
unimaginable
.
Just
here
her
intelligence
dropped
,
*NL*
from
literal
inability
to
say
what
it
was
that
Madame
Merle
had
been
.
*NL*
Whatever
it
was
it
was
for
Madame
Merle
herself
to
regret
it
;
and
*NL*
doubtless
she
would
do
so
in
America
,
where
she
had
announced
she
was
*NL*
going
.
It
concerned
Isabel
no
more
;
she
only
had
an
impression
that
she
*NL*
should
never
again
see
Madame
Merle
.
This
impression
carried
her
into
*NL*
the
future
,
of
which
from
time
to
time
she
had
a
mutilated
glimpse
.
She
*NL*
saw
herself
,
in
the
distant
years
,
still
in
the
attitude
of
a
woman
who
*NL*
had
her
life
to
live
,
and
these
intimations
contradicted
the
spirit
of
*NL*
the
present
hour
.
It
might
be
desirable
to
get
quite
away
,
really
away
,
*NL*
further
away
than
little
grey-green
England
,
but
this
privilege
was
*NL*
evidently
to
be
denied
her
.
Deep
in
her
soul
--
deeper
than
any
appetite
*NL*
for
renunciation
--
was
the
sense
that
life
would
be
her
business
for
a
*NL*
long
time
to
come
.
And
at
moments
there
was
something
inspiring
,
almost
*NL*
enlivening
,
in
the
conviction
.
It
was
a
proof
of
strength
--
it
was
a
*NL*
proof
she
should
some
day
be
happy
again
.
It
could
n't
be
she
was
to
live
*NL*
only
to
suffer
;
she
was
still
young
,
after
all
,
and
a
great
many
things
*NL*
might
happen
to
her
yet
.
To
live
only
to
suffer
--
only
to
feel
the
injury
*NL*
of
life
repeated
and
enlarged
--
it
seemed
to
her
she
was
too
valuable
,
*NL*
too
capable
,
for
that
.
Then
she
wondered
if
it
were
vain
and
stupid
*NL*
to
think
so
well
of
herself
.
When
had
it
even
been
a
guarantee
to
be
*NL*
valuable
?
Was
n't
all
history
full
of
the
destruction
of
precious
things
?
*NL*
Was
n't
it
much
more
probable
that
if
one
were
fine
one
would
suffer
?
It
*NL*
involved
then
perhaps
an
admission
that
one
had
a
certain
grossness
;
but
*NL*
Isabel
recognised
,
as
it
passed
before
her
eyes
,
the
quick
vague
shadow
*NL*
of
a
long
future
.
She
should
never
escape
;
she
should
last
to
the
end
.
*NL*
Then
the
middle
years
wrapped
her
about
again
and
the
grey
curtain
of
*NL*
her
indifference
closed
her
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
kissed
her
,
as
Henrietta
usually
kissed
,
as
if
she
were
afraid
*NL*
she
should
be
caught
doing
it
;
and
then
Isabel
stood
there
in
the
crowd
,
*NL*
looking
about
her
,
looking
for
her
servant
.
She
asked
nothing
;
she
*NL*
wished
to
wait
.
She
had
a
sudden
perception
that
she
should
be
helped
.
*NL*
She
rejoiced
Henrietta
had
come
;
there
was
something
terrible
in
an
*NL*
arrival
in
London
.
The
dusky
,
smoky
,
far-arching
vault
of
the
station
,
*NL*
the
strange
,
livid
light
,
the
dense
,
dark
,
pushing
crowd
,
filled
her
*NL*
with
a
nervous
fear
and
made
her
put
her
arm
into
her
friend
's
.
She
*NL*
remembered
she
had
once
liked
these
things
;
they
seemed
part
of
a
mighty
*NL*
spectacle
in
which
there
was
something
that
touched
her
.
She
remembered
*NL*
how
she
walked
away
from
Euston
,
in
the
winter
dusk
,
in
the
crowded
*NL*
streets
,
five
years
before
.
She
could
not
have
done
that
to-day
,
and
the
*NL*
incident
came
before
her
as
the
deed
of
another
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
beautiful
that
you
should
have
come
,
''
said
Henrietta
,
looking
*NL*
at
her
as
if
she
thought
Isabel
might
be
prepared
to
challenge
the
*NL*
proposition
.
``
If
you
had
n't
--
if
you
had
n't
;
well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
*NL*
remarked
Miss
Stackpole
,
hinting
ominously
at
her
powers
of
disapproval
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
looked
about
without
seeing
her
maid
.
Her
eyes
rested
on
another
*NL*
figure
,
however
,
which
she
felt
she
had
seen
before
;
and
in
a
moment
*NL*
she
recognised
the
genial
countenance
of
Mr.
Bantling
.
He
stood
a
little
*NL*
apart
,
and
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
the
multitude
that
pressed
about
*NL*
him
to
make
him
yield
an
inch
of
the
ground
he
had
taken
--
that
of
*NL*
abstracting
himself
discreetly
while
the
two
ladies
performed
their
*NL*
embraces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
Mr.
Bantling
,
''
said
Isabel
,
gently
,
irrelevantly
,
scarcely
*NL*
caring
much
now
whether
she
should
find
her
maid
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
he
goes
everywhere
with
me
.
Come
here
,
Mr.
Bantling
!
''
Henrietta
*NL*
exclaimed
.
Whereupon
the
gallant
bachelor
advanced
with
a
smile
--
a
smile
*NL*
tempered
,
however
,
by
the
gravity
of
the
occasion
.
``
Is
n't
it
lovely
she
*NL*
has
come
?
''
Henrietta
asked
.
``
He
knows
all
about
it
,
''
she
added
;
``
we
had
*NL*
quite
a
discussion
.
He
said
you
would
n't
,
I
said
you
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
always
agreed
,
''
Isabel
smiled
in
return
.
She
felt
she
*NL*
could
smile
now
;
she
had
seen
in
an
instant
,
in
Mr.
Bantling
's
brave
*NL*
eyes
,
that
he
had
good
news
for
her
.
They
seemed
to
say
he
wished
her
to
*NL*
remember
he
was
an
old
friend
of
her
cousin
--
that
he
understood
,
that
*NL*
it
was
all
right
.
Isabel
gave
him
her
hand
;
she
thought
of
him
,
*NL*
extravagantly
,
as
a
beautiful
blameless
knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
always
agree
,
''
said
Mr.
Bantling
.
``
But
she
does
n't
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
tell
you
that
a
maid
was
a
nuisance
?
''
Henrietta
enquired
.
*NL*
``
Your
young
lady
has
probably
remained
at
Calais
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
,
''
said
Isabel
,
looking
at
Mr.
Bantling
,
whom
she
had
never
*NL*
found
so
interesting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
with
her
while
I
go
and
see
,
''
Henrietta
commanded
,
leaving
the
two
*NL*
for
a
moment
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
there
at
first
in
silence
,
and
then
Mr.
Bantling
asked
Isabel
*NL*
how
it
had
been
on
the
Channel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
fine
.
No
,
I
believe
it
was
very
rough
,
''
she
said
,
to
her
*NL*
companion
's
obvious
surprise
.
After
which
she
added
:
``
You
've
been
to
*NL*
Gardencourt
,
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
how
do
you
know
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
--
except
that
you
look
like
a
person
who
has
been
to
*NL*
Gardencourt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
I
look
awfully
sad
?
It
's
awfully
sad
there
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
you
ever
look
awfully
sad
.
You
look
awfully
kind
,
''
*NL*
said
Isabel
with
a
breadth
that
cost
her
no
effort
.
It
seemed
to
her
she
*NL*
should
never
again
feel
a
superficial
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mr.
Bantling
,
however
,
was
still
in
this
inferior
stage
.
He
blushed
*NL*
a
good
deal
and
laughed
,
he
assured
her
that
he
was
often
very
blue
,
*NL*
and
that
when
he
was
blue
he
was
awfully
fierce
.
``
You
can
ask
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
,
you
know
.
I
was
at
Gardencourt
two
days
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
my
cousin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
for
a
little
.
But
he
had
been
seeing
people
;
Warburton
had
been
*NL*
there
the
day
before
.
Ralph
was
just
the
same
as
usual
,
except
that
he
*NL*
was
in
bed
and
that
he
looks
tremendously
ill
and
that
he
ca
n't
speak
,
''
*NL*
Mr.
Bantling
pursued
.
``
He
was
awfully
jolly
and
funny
all
the
same
.
He
*NL*
was
just
as
clever
as
ever
.
It
's
awfully
wretched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
in
the
crowded
,
noisy
station
this
simple
picture
was
vivid
.
``
Was
*NL*
that
late
in
the
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
went
on
purpose
.
We
thought
you
'd
like
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
greatly
obliged
to
you
.
Can
I
go
down
tonight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
do
n't
think
SHE
'LL
let
you
go
,
''
said
Mr.
Bantling
.
``
She
wants
you
*NL*
to
stop
with
her
.
I
made
Touchett
's
man
promise
to
telegraph
me
to-day
,
*NL*
and
I
found
the
telegram
an
hour
ago
at
my
club
.
`
Quiet
and
easy
,
'
*NL*
that
's
what
it
says
,
and
it
's
dated
two
o'clock
.
So
you
see
you
can
wait
*NL*
till
to-morrow
.
You
must
be
awfully
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
awfully
tired
.
And
I
thank
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Mr.
Bantling
,
``
We
were
certain
you
would
like
the
last
news
.
''
*NL*
On
which
Isabel
vaguely
noted
that
he
and
Henrietta
seemed
after
all
to
*NL*
agree
.
Miss
Stackpole
came
back
with
Isabel
's
maid
,
whom
she
had
caught
*NL*
in
the
act
of
proving
her
utility
.
This
excellent
person
,
instead
of
*NL*
losing
herself
in
the
crowd
,
had
simply
attended
to
her
mistress
's
*NL*
luggage
,
so
that
the
latter
was
now
at
liberty
to
leave
the
station
.
*NL*
``
You
know
you
're
not
to
think
of
going
to
the
country
to-night
,
''
*NL*
Henrietta
remarked
to
her
.
``
It
does
n't
matter
whether
there
's
a
train
*NL*
or
not
.
You
're
to
come
straight
to
me
in
Wimpole
Street
.
There
is
n't
a
*NL*
corner
to
be
had
in
London
,
but
I
've
got
you
one
all
the
same
.
It
is
n't
*NL*
a
Roman
palace
,
but
it
will
do
for
a
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
do
whatever
you
wish
,
''
Isabel
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
come
and
answer
a
few
questions
;
that
's
what
I
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
say
anything
about
dinner
,
does
she
,
Mrs.
Osmond
?
''
Mr.
*NL*
Bantling
enquired
jocosely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
fixed
him
a
moment
with
her
speculative
gaze
.
``
I
see
you
're
*NL*
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
your
own
.
You
'll
be
at
the
Paddington
Station
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
at
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
come
for
my
sake
,
Mr.
Bantling
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
come
for
mine
,
''
Henrietta
declared
as
she
ushered
her
friend
into
*NL*
a
cab
.
And
later
,
in
a
large
dusky
parlour
in
Wimpole
Street
--
to
do
her
*NL*
justice
there
had
been
dinner
enough
--
she
asked
those
questions
to
which
*NL*
she
had
alluded
at
the
station
.
``
Did
your
husband
make
you
a
scene
about
*NL*
your
coming
?
''
That
was
Miss
Stackpole
's
first
enquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
ca
n't
say
he
made
a
scene
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
n't
object
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
objected
very
much
.
But
it
was
not
what
you
'd
call
a
scene
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
very
quiet
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
for
a
moment
regarded
her
guest
.
``
It
must
have
been
hellish
,
''
*NL*
she
then
remarked
.
And
Isabel
did
n't
deny
that
it
had
been
hellish
.
But
*NL*
she
confined
herself
to
answering
Henrietta
's
questions
,
which
was
easy
,
*NL*
as
they
were
tolerably
definite
.
For
the
present
she
offered
her
no
*NL*
new
information
.
``
Well
,
''
said
Miss
Stackpole
at
last
,
``
I
've
only
one
*NL*
criticism
to
make
.
I
do
n't
see
why
you
promised
little
Miss
Osmond
to
go
*NL*
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
I
myself
see
now
,
''
Isabel
replied
.
``
But
I
did
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
've
forgotten
your
reason
perhaps
you
wo
n't
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
waited
a
moment
.
``
Perhaps
I
shall
find
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
certainly
never
find
a
good
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
default
of
a
better
my
having
promised
will
do
,
''
Isabel
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
that
's
why
I
hate
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
of
it
now
.
I
've
a
little
time
.
Coming
away
was
a
*NL*
complication
,
but
what
will
going
back
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
remember
,
after
all
,
that
he
wo
n't
make
you
a
scene
!
''
said
*NL*
Henrietta
with
much
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
,
though
,
''
Isabel
answered
gravely
.
``
It
wo
n't
be
the
scene
of
a
*NL*
moment
;
it
will
be
a
scene
of
the
rest
of
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
minutes
the
two
women
sat
and
considered
this
remainder
,
and
*NL*
then
Miss
Stackpole
,
to
change
the
subject
,
as
Isabel
had
requested
,
*NL*
announced
abruptly
:
``
I
've
been
to
stay
with
Lady
Pensil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
invitation
came
at
last
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
took
five
years
.
But
this
time
she
wanted
to
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
more
natural
than
I
think
you
know
,
''
said
Henrietta
,
who
fixed
*NL*
her
eyes
on
a
distant
point
.
And
then
she
added
,
turning
suddenly
:
*NL*
``
Isabel
Archer
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
You
do
n't
know
why
?
Because
I
*NL*
criticised
you
,
and
yet
I
've
gone
further
than
you
.
Mr.
Osmond
,
at
*NL*
least
,
was
born
on
the
other
side
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
moment
before
Isabel
grasped
her
meaning
;
this
sense
was
so
*NL*
modestly
,
or
at
least
so
ingeniously
,
veiled
.
Isabel
's
mind
was
not
*NL*
possessed
at
present
with
the
comicality
of
things
;
but
she
greeted
with
*NL*
a
quick
laugh
the
image
that
her
companion
had
raised
.
She
immediately
*NL*
recovered
herself
,
however
,
and
with
the
right
excess
of
intensity
,
*NL*
``
Henrietta
Stackpole
,
''
she
asked
,
``
are
you
going
to
give
up
your
*NL*
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
poor
Isabel
,
I
am
.
I
wo
n't
pretend
to
deny
it
;
I
look
the
fact
:
*NL*
in
the
face
.
I
'm
going
to
marry
Mr.
Bantling
and
locate
right
here
in
*NL*
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
very
strange
,
''
said
Isabel
,
smiling
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
yes
,
I
suppose
it
does
.
I
've
come
to
it
little
by
little
.
I
think
*NL*
I
know
what
I
'm
doing
;
but
I
do
n't
know
as
I
can
explain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
ca
n't
explain
one
's
marriage
,
''
Isabel
answered
.
``
And
yours
does
n't
*NL*
need
to
be
explained
.
Mr.
Bantling
is
n't
a
riddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
is
n't
a
bad
pun
--
or
even
a
high
flight
of
American
humour
.
He
*NL*
has
a
beautiful
nature
,
''
Henrietta
went
on
.
``
I
've
studied
him
for
many
*NL*
years
and
I
see
right
through
him
.
He
's
as
clear
as
the
style
of
a
good
*NL*
prospectus
.
He
's
not
intellectual
,
but
he
appreciates
intellect
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
he
does
n't
exaggerate
its
claims
.
I
sometimes
think
we
do
in
*NL*
the
United
States
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
you
're
changed
indeed
!
It
's
the
first
time
I
've
ever
*NL*
heard
you
say
anything
against
your
native
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
say
that
we
're
too
infatuated
with
mere
brain-power
;
that
,
after
*NL*
all
,
is
n't
a
vulgar
fault
.
But
I
AM
changed
;
a
woman
has
to
change
a
*NL*
good
deal
to
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
'll
be
very
happy
.
You
will
at
last
--
over
here
--
see
something
*NL*
of
the
inner
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
gave
a
little
significant
sigh
.
``
That
's
the
key
to
the
*NL*
mystery
,
I
believe
.
I
could
n't
endure
to
be
kept
off
.
Now
I
've
as
good
*NL*
a
right
as
any
one
!
''
she
added
with
artless
elation
.
Isabel
was
duly
*NL*
diverted
,
but
there
was
a
certain
melancholy
in
her
view
.
Henrietta
,
*NL*
after
all
,
had
confessed
herself
human
and
feminine
,
Henrietta
whom
she
*NL*
had
hitherto
regarded
as
a
light
keen
flame
,
a
disembodied
voice
.
It
was
*NL*
a
disappointment
to
find
she
had
personal
susceptibilities
,
that
she
was
*NL*
subject
to
common
passions
,
and
that
her
intimacy
with
Mr.
Bantling
had
*NL*
not
been
completely
original
.
There
was
a
want
of
originality
in
her
*NL*
marrying
him
--
there
was
even
a
kind
of
stupidity
;
and
for
a
moment
,
to
*NL*
Isabel
's
sense
,
the
dreariness
of
the
world
took
on
a
deeper
tinge
.
A
*NL*
little
later
indeed
she
reflected
that
Mr.
Bantling
himself
at
least
was
*NL*
original
.
But
she
did
n't
see
how
Henrietta
could
give
up
her
country
.
*NL*
She
herself
had
relaxed
her
hold
of
it
,
but
it
had
never
been
her
*NL*
country
as
it
had
been
Henrietta
's
.
She
presently
asked
her
if
she
had
*NL*
enjoyed
her
visit
to
Lady
Pensil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
Henrietta
,
``
she
did
n't
know
what
to
make
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
that
very
enjoyable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
so
,
because
she
's
supposed
to
be
a
master
mind
.
She
thinks
*NL*
she
knows
everything
;
but
she
does
n't
understand
a
woman
of
my
modern
*NL*
type
.
It
would
be
so
much
easier
for
her
if
I
were
only
a
little
better
*NL*
or
a
little
worse
.
She
's
so
puzzled
;
I
believe
she
thinks
it
's
my
duty
*NL*
to
go
and
do
something
immoral
.
She
thinks
it
's
immoral
that
I
should
*NL*
marry
her
brother
;
but
,
after
all
,
that
is
n't
immoral
enough
.
And
she
'll
*NL*
never
understand
my
mixture
--
never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
so
intelligent
as
her
brother
then
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
He
appears
*NL*
to
have
understood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
he
has
n't
!
''
cried
Miss
Stackpole
with
decision
.
``
I
really
*NL*
believe
that
's
what
he
wants
to
marry
me
for
--
just
to
find
out
the
*NL*
mystery
and
the
proportions
of
it
.
That
's
a
fixed
idea
--
a
kind
of
*NL*
fascination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
good
in
you
to
humour
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
,
''
said
Henrietta
,
``
I
've
something
to
find
out
too
!
''
And
Isabel
*NL*
saw
that
she
had
not
renounced
an
allegiance
,
but
planned
an
attack
.
She
*NL*
was
at
last
about
to
grapple
in
earnest
with
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
also
perceived
,
however
,
on
the
morrow
,
at
the
Paddington
*NL*
Station
,
where
she
found
herself
,
at
ten
o'clock
,
in
the
company
both
*NL*
of
Miss
Stackpole
and
Mr.
Bantling
,
that
the
gentleman
bore
his
*NL*
perplexities
lightly
.
If
he
had
not
found
out
everything
he
had
found
*NL*
out
at
least
the
great
point
--
that
Miss
Stackpole
would
not
be
wanting
*NL*
in
initiative
.
It
was
evident
that
in
the
selection
of
a
wife
he
had
*NL*
been
on
his
guard
against
this
deficiency
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henrietta
has
told
me
,
and
I
'm
very
glad
,
''
Isabel
said
as
she
gave
him
*NL*
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
you
think
it
awfully
odd
,
''
Mr.
Bantling
replied
,
resting
on
*NL*
his
neat
umbrella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
it
awfully
odd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
think
it
so
awfully
odd
as
I
do
.
But
I
've
always
rather
liked
*NL*
striking
out
a
line
,

said
Mr.
Bantling
serenely
.

CHAPTER
LIV
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
's
arrival
at
Gardencourt
on
this
second
occasion
was
even
*NL*
quieter
than
it
had
been
on
the
first
.
Ralph
Touchett
kept
but
a
small
*NL*
household
,
and
to
the
new
servants
Mrs.
Osmond
was
a
stranger
;
so
that
*NL*
instead
of
being
conducted
to
her
own
apartment
she
was
coldly
shown
*NL*
into
the
drawing-room
and
left
to
wait
while
her
name
was
carried
up
to
*NL*
her
aunt
.
She
waited
a
long
time
;
Mrs.
Touchett
appeared
in
no
hurry
to
*NL*
come
to
her
.
She
grew
impatient
at
last
;
she
grew
nervous
and
scared
--
as
*NL*
scared
as
if
the
objects
about
her
had
begun
to
show
for
conscious
*NL*
things
,
watching
her
trouble
with
grotesque
grimaces
.
The
day
was
dark
*NL*
and
cold
;
the
dusk
was
thick
in
the
corners
of
the
wide
brown
rooms
.
The
*NL*
house
was
perfectly
still
--
with
a
stillness
that
Isabel
remembered
;
it
*NL*
had
filled
all
the
place
for
days
before
the
death
of
her
uncle
.
She
*NL*
left
the
drawing-room
and
wandered
about
--
strolled
into
the
library
and
*NL*
along
the
gallery
of
pictures
,
where
,
in
the
deep
silence
,
her
footstep
*NL*
made
an
echo
.
Nothing
was
changed
;
she
recognised
everything
she
had
*NL*
seen
years
before
;
it
might
have
been
only
yesterday
she
had
stood
*NL*
there
.
She
envied
the
security
of
valuable
``
pieces
''
which
change
by
no
*NL*
hair
's
breadth
,
only
grow
in
value
,
while
their
owners
lose
inch
by
*NL*
inch
youth
,
happiness
,
beauty
;
and
she
became
aware
that
she
was
walking
*NL*
about
as
her
aunt
had
done
on
the
day
she
had
come
to
see
her
in
Albany
.
*NL*
She
was
changed
enough
since
then
--
that
had
been
the
beginning
.
It
*NL*
suddenly
struck
her
that
if
her
Aunt
Lydia
had
not
come
that
day
in
just
*NL*
that
way
and
found
her
alone
,
everything
might
have
been
different
.
She
*NL*
might
have
had
another
life
and
she
might
have
been
a
woman
more
blest
.
*NL*
She
stopped
in
the
gallery
in
front
of
a
small
picture
--
a
charming
and
*NL*
precious
Bonington
--
upon
which
her
eyes
rested
a
long
time
.
But
she
was
*NL*
not
looking
at
the
picture
;
she
was
wondering
whether
if
her
aunt
had
*NL*
not
come
that
day
in
Albany
she
would
have
married
Caspar
Goodwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
appeared
at
last
,
just
after
Isabel
had
returned
to
the
*NL*
big
uninhabited
drawing-room
.
She
looked
a
good
deal
older
,
but
her
*NL*
eye
was
as
bright
as
ever
and
her
head
as
erect
;
her
thin
lips
seemed
a
*NL*
repository
of
latent
meanings
.
She
wore
a
little
grey
dress
of
the
most
*NL*
undecorated
fashion
,
and
Isabel
wondered
,
as
she
had
wondered
the
first
*NL*
time
,
if
her
remarkable
kinswoman
resembled
more
a
queen-regent
or
the
*NL*
matron
of
a
gaol
.
Her
lips
felt
very
thin
indeed
on
Isabel
's
hot
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
kept
you
waiting
because
I
've
been
sitting
with
Ralph
,
''
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
said
.
``
The
nurse
had
gone
to
luncheon
and
I
had
taken
her
*NL*
place
.
He
has
a
man
who
's
supposed
to
look
after
him
,
but
the
man
's
good
*NL*
for
nothing
;
he
's
always
looking
out
of
the
window
--
as
if
there
were
*NL*
anything
to
see
!
I
did
n't
wish
to
move
,
because
Ralph
seemed
to
be
*NL*
sleeping
and
I
was
afraid
the
sound
would
disturb
him
.
I
waited
till
the
*NL*
nurse
came
back
.
I
remembered
you
knew
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
find
I
know
it
better
even
than
I
thought
;
I
've
been
walking
*NL*
everywhere
,
''
Isabel
answered
.
And
then
she
asked
if
Ralph
slept
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
lies
with
his
eyes
closed
;
he
does
n't
move
.
But
I
'm
not
sure
that
*NL*
it
's
always
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
he
see
me
?
Can
he
speak
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
declined
the
office
of
saying
.
``
You
can
try
him
,
''
was
the
*NL*
limit
of
her
extravagance
.
And
then
she
offered
to
conduct
Isabel
to
her
*NL*
room
.
``
I
thought
they
had
taken
you
there
;
but
it
's
not
my
house
,
it
's
*NL*
Ralph
's
;
and
I
do
n't
know
what
they
do
.
They
must
at
least
have
taken
*NL*
your
luggage
;
I
do
n't
suppose
you
've
brought
much
.
Not
that
I
care
,
*NL*
however
.
I
believe
they
've
given
you
the
same
room
you
had
before
;
when
*NL*
Ralph
heard
you
were
coming
he
said
you
must
have
that
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
say
anything
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
,
he
does
n't
chatter
as
he
used
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Touchett
as
she
*NL*
preceded
her
niece
up
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
same
room
,
and
something
told
Isabel
it
had
not
been
slept
*NL*
in
since
she
occupied
it
.
Her
luggage
was
there
and
was
not
voluminous
;
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
sat
down
a
moment
with
her
eyes
upon
it
.
``
Is
there
really
*NL*
no
hope
?
''
our
young
woman
asked
as
she
stood
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
whatever
.
There
never
has
been
.
It
has
not
been
a
successful
*NL*
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
it
has
only
been
a
beautiful
one
.
''
Isabel
found
herself
already
*NL*
contradicting
her
aunt
;
she
was
irritated
by
her
dryness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
that
;
there
's
no
beauty
without
health
.
*NL*
That
is
a
very
odd
dress
to
travel
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
glanced
at
her
garment
.
``
I
left
Rome
at
an
hour
's
notice
;
I
took
*NL*
the
first
that
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sisters
,
in
America
,
wished
to
know
how
you
dress
.
That
seemed
to
*NL*
be
their
principal
interest
.
I
was
n't
able
to
tell
them
--
but
they
seemed
*NL*
to
have
the
right
idea
:
that
you
never
wear
anything
less
than
black
*NL*
brocade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
think
I
'm
more
brilliant
than
I
am
;
I
'm
afraid
to
tell
them
the
*NL*
truth
,
''
said
Isabel
.
``
Lily
wrote
me
you
had
dined
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
invited
me
four
times
,
and
I
went
once
.
After
the
second
time
she
*NL*
should
have
let
me
alone
.
The
dinner
was
very
good
;
it
must
have
been
*NL*
expensive
.
Her
husband
has
a
very
bad
manner
.
Did
I
enjoy
my
visit
to
*NL*
America
?
Why
should
I
have
enjoyed
it
?
I
did
n't
go
for
my
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
interesting
items
,
but
Mrs.
Touchett
soon
left
her
niece
,
*NL*
whom
she
was
to
meet
in
half
an
hour
at
the
midday
meal
.
For
this
*NL*
repast
the
two
ladies
faced
each
other
at
an
abbreviated
table
in
the
*NL*
melancholy
dining-room
.
Here
,
after
a
little
,
Isabel
saw
her
aunt
not
*NL*
to
be
so
dry
as
she
appeared
,
and
her
old
pity
for
the
poor
woman
's
*NL*
inexpressiveness
,
her
want
of
regret
,
of
disappointment
,
came
back
to
*NL*
her
.
Unmistakeably
she
would
have
found
it
a
blessing
to-day
to
be
able
*NL*
to
feel
a
defeat
,
a
mistake
,
even
a
shame
or
two
.
She
wondered
if
she
*NL*
were
not
even
missing
those
enrichments
of
consciousness
and
privately
*NL*
trying
--
reaching
out
for
some
aftertaste
of
life
,
dregs
of
the
banquet
;
*NL*
the
testimony
of
pain
or
the
cold
recreation
of
remorse
.
On
the
other
*NL*
hand
perhaps
she
was
afraid
;
if
she
should
begin
to
know
remorse
at
all
*NL*
it
might
take
her
too
far
.
Isabel
could
perceive
,
however
,
how
it
had
*NL*
come
over
her
dimly
that
she
had
failed
of
something
,
that
she
saw
*NL*
herself
in
the
future
as
an
old
woman
without
memories
.
Her
little
*NL*
sharp
face
looked
tragical
.
She
told
her
niece
that
Ralph
had
as
yet
not
*NL*
moved
,
but
that
he
probably
would
be
able
to
see
her
before
dinner
.
*NL*
And
then
in
a
moment
she
added
that
he
had
seen
Lord
Warburton
the
day
*NL*
before
;
an
announcement
which
startled
Isabel
a
little
,
as
it
seemed
*NL*
an
intimation
that
this
personage
was
in
the
neighbourhood
and
that
an
*NL*
accident
might
bring
them
together
.
Such
an
accident
would
not
be
happy
;
*NL*
she
had
not
come
to
England
to
struggle
again
with
Lord
Warburton
.
She
*NL*
none
the
less
presently
said
to
her
aunt
that
he
had
been
very
kind
to
*NL*
Ralph
;
she
had
seen
something
of
that
in
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
something
else
to
think
of
now
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
returned
.
And
she
*NL*
paused
with
a
gaze
like
a
gimlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
saw
she
meant
something
,
and
instantly
guessed
what
she
meant
.
*NL*
But
her
reply
concealed
her
guess
;
her
heart
beat
faster
and
she
wished
*NL*
to
gain
a
moment
.
``
Ah
yes
--
the
House
of
Lords
and
all
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
thinking
of
the
Lords
;
he
's
thinking
of
the
ladies
.
At
least
*NL*
he
's
thinking
of
one
of
them
;
he
told
Ralph
he
's
engaged
to
be
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
to
be
married
!
''
Isabel
mildly
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
he
breaks
it
off
.
He
seemed
to
think
Ralph
would
like
to
know
.
*NL*
Poor
Ralph
ca
n't
go
to
the
wedding
,
though
I
believe
it
's
to
take
place
*NL*
very
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
's
the
young
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
member
of
the
aristocracy
;
Lady
Flora
,
Lady
Felicia
--
something
of
*NL*
that
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
glad
,
''
Isabel
said
.
``
It
must
be
a
sudden
decision
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sudden
enough
,
I
believe
;
a
courtship
of
three
weeks
.
It
has
only
just
*NL*
been
made
public
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
glad
,
''
Isabel
repeated
with
a
larger
emphasis
.
She
knew
her
*NL*
aunt
was
watching
her
--
looking
for
the
signs
of
some
imputed
soreness
,
*NL*
and
the
desire
to
prevent
her
companion
from
seeing
anything
of
this
*NL*
kind
enabled
her
to
speak
in
the
tone
of
quick
satisfaction
,
the
tone
*NL*
almost
of
relief
.
Mrs.
Touchett
of
course
followed
the
tradition
that
*NL*
ladies
,
even
married
ones
,
regard
the
marriage
of
their
old
lovers
as
*NL*
an
offence
to
themselves
.
Isabel
's
first
care
therefore
was
to
show
*NL*
that
however
that
might
be
in
general
she
was
not
offended
now
.
But
*NL*
meanwhile
,
as
I
say
,
her
heart
beat
faster
;
and
if
she
sat
for
some
*NL*
moments
thoughtful
--
she
presently
forgot
Mrs.
Touchett
's
observation
--
it
*NL*
was
not
because
she
had
lost
an
admirer
.
Her
imagination
had
traversed
*NL*
half
Europe
;
it
halted
,
panting
,
and
even
trembling
a
little
,
in
the
*NL*
city
of
Rome
.
She
figured
herself
announcing
to
her
husband
that
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
was
to
lead
a
bride
to
the
altar
,
and
she
was
of
course
*NL*
not
aware
how
extremely
wan
she
must
have
looked
while
she
made
this
*NL*
intellectual
effort
.
But
at
last
she
collected
herself
and
said
to
her
*NL*
aunt
:
``
He
was
sure
to
do
it
some
time
or
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
was
silent
;
then
she
gave
a
sharp
little
shake
of
the
*NL*
head
.
``
Ah
,
my
dear
,
you
're
beyond
me
!
''
she
cried
suddenly
.
They
went
on
*NL*
with
their
luncheon
in
silence
;
Isabel
felt
as
if
she
had
heard
of
Lord
*NL*
Warburton
's
death
.
She
had
known
him
only
as
a
suitor
,
and
now
that
was
*NL*
all
over
.
He
was
dead
for
poor
Pansy
;
by
Pansy
he
might
have
lived
.
A
*NL*
servant
had
been
hovering
about
;
at
last
Mrs.
Touchett
requested
him
*NL*
to
leave
them
alone
.
She
had
finished
her
meal
;
she
sat
with
her
*NL*
hands
folded
on
the
edge
of
the
table
.
``
I
should
like
to
ask
you
three
*NL*
questions
,
''
she
observed
when
the
servant
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
are
a
great
many
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
do
with
less
;
I
've
been
thinking
.
They
're
all
very
good
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
'm
afraid
of
.
The
best
questions
are
the
worst
,
''
Isabel
*NL*
answered
.
Mrs.
Touchett
had
pushed
back
her
chair
,
and
as
her
niece
left
*NL*
the
table
and
walked
,
rather
consciously
,
to
one
of
the
deep
windows
,
*NL*
she
felt
herself
followed
by
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
been
sorry
you
did
n't
marry
Lord
Warburton
?
''
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
shook
her
head
slowly
,
but
not
heavily
.
``
No
,
dear
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
.
I
ought
to
tell
you
that
I
propose
to
believe
what
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
believing
me
's
an
immense
temptation
,
''
she
declared
,
smiling
*NL*
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
temptation
to
lie
?
I
do
n't
recommend
you
to
do
that
,
for
when
I
'm
*NL*
misinformed
I
'm
as
dangerous
as
a
poisoned
rat
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
crow
*NL*
over
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
my
husband
who
does
n't
get
on
with
me
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
have
told
him
he
would
n't
.
I
do
n't
call
that
crowing
over
YOU
,
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
added
.
``
Do
you
still
like
Serena
Merle
?
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
as
I
once
did
.
But
it
does
n't
matter
,
for
she
's
going
to
America
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
America
?
She
must
have
done
something
very
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
very
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
what
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
made
a
convenience
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Touchett
,
``
so
she
did
of
me
!
She
does
of
every
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
make
a
convenience
of
America
,
''
said
Isabel
,
smiling
again
and
*NL*
glad
that
her
aunt
's
questions
were
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
the
evening
that
she
was
able
to
see
Ralph
.
He
had
been
*NL*
dozing
all
day
;
at
least
he
had
been
lying
unconscious
.
The
doctor
was
*NL*
there
,
but
after
a
while
went
away
--
the
local
doctor
,
who
had
attended
*NL*
his
father
and
whom
Ralph
liked
.
He
came
three
or
four
times
a
day
;
he
*NL*
was
deeply
interested
in
his
patient
.
Ralph
had
had
Sir
Matthew
Hope
,
*NL*
but
he
had
got
tired
of
this
celebrated
man
,
to
whom
he
had
asked
his
*NL*
mother
to
send
word
he
was
now
dead
and
was
therefore
without
further
*NL*
need
of
medical
advice
.
Mrs.
Touchett
had
simply
written
to
Sir
Matthew
*NL*
that
her
son
disliked
him
.
On
the
day
of
Isabel
's
arrival
Ralph
gave
no
*NL*
sign
,
as
I
have
related
,
for
many
hours
;
but
toward
evening
he
raised
*NL*
himself
and
said
he
knew
that
she
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
he
knew
was
not
apparent
,
inasmuch
as
for
fear
of
exciting
him
no
*NL*
one
had
offered
the
information
.
Isabel
came
in
and
sat
by
his
bed
in
*NL*
the
dim
light
;
there
was
only
a
shaded
candle
in
a
corner
of
the
room
.
*NL*
She
told
the
nurse
she
might
go
--
she
herself
would
sit
with
him
for
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
evening
.
He
had
opened
his
eyes
and
recognised
her
,
and
had
*NL*
moved
his
hand
,
which
lay
helpless
beside
him
,
so
that
she
might
take
*NL*
it
.
But
he
was
unable
to
speak
;
he
closed
his
eyes
again
and
remained
*NL*
perfectly
still
,
only
keeping
her
hand
in
his
own
.
She
sat
with
him
a
*NL*
long
time
--
till
the
nurse
came
back
;
but
he
gave
no
further
sign
.
He
*NL*
might
have
passed
away
while
she
looked
at
him
;
he
was
already
the
*NL*
figure
and
pattern
of
death
.
She
had
thought
him
far
gone
in
Rome
,
*NL*
and
this
was
worse
;
there
was
but
one
change
possible
now
.
There
was
a
*NL*
strange
tranquillity
in
his
face
;
it
was
as
still
as
the
lid
of
a
box
.
*NL*
With
this
he
was
a
mere
lattice
of
bones
;
when
he
opened
his
eyes
to
*NL*
greet
her
it
was
as
if
she
were
looking
into
immeasurable
space
.
It
was
*NL*
not
till
midnight
that
the
nurse
came
back
;
but
the
hours
,
to
Isabel
,
*NL*
had
not
seemed
long
;
it
was
exactly
what
she
had
come
for
.
If
she
had
*NL*
come
simply
to
wait
she
found
ample
occasion
,
for
he
lay
three
days
in
*NL*
a
kind
of
grateful
silence
.
He
recognised
her
and
at
moments
seemed
to
*NL*
wish
to
speak
;
but
he
found
no
voice
.
Then
he
closed
his
eyes
again
,
as
*NL*
if
he
too
were
waiting
for
something
--
for
something
that
certainly
would
*NL*
come
.
He
was
so
absolutely
quiet
that
it
seemed
to
her
what
was
coming
*NL*
had
already
arrived
;
and
yet
she
never
lost
the
sense
that
they
were
*NL*
still
together
.
But
they
were
not
always
together
;
there
were
other
*NL*
hours
that
she
passed
in
wandering
through
the
empty
house
and
listening
*NL*
for
a
voice
that
was
not
poor
Ralph
's
.
She
had
a
constant
fear
;
she
*NL*
thought
it
possible
her
husband
would
write
to
her
.
But
he
remained
*NL*
silent
,
and
she
only
got
a
letter
from
Florence
and
from
the
Countess
*NL*
Gemini
.
Ralph
,
however
,
spoke
at
last
--
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
better
to-night
,
''
he
murmured
,
abruptly
,
in
the
soundless
*NL*
dimness
of
her
vigil
;
``
I
think
I
can
say
something
.
''
She
sank
upon
her
*NL*
knees
beside
his
pillow
;
took
his
thin
hand
in
her
own
;
begged
him
*NL*
not
to
make
an
effort
--
not
to
tire
himself
.
His
face
was
of
necessity
*NL*
serious
--
it
was
incapable
of
the
muscular
play
of
a
smile
;
but
its
owner
*NL*
apparently
had
not
lost
a
perception
of
incongruities
.
``
What
does
it
*NL*
matter
if
I
'm
tired
when
I
've
all
eternity
to
rest
?
There
's
no
harm
in
*NL*
making
an
effort
when
it
's
the
very
last
of
all
.
Do
n't
people
always
*NL*
feel
better
just
before
the
end
?
I
've
often
heard
of
that
;
it
's
what
I
*NL*
was
waiting
for
.
Ever
since
you
've
been
here
I
thought
it
would
come
.
*NL*
I
tried
two
or
three
times
;
I
was
afraid
you
'd
get
tired
of
sitting
*NL*
there
.
''
He
spoke
slowly
,
with
painful
breaks
and
long
pauses
;
his
voice
*NL*
seemed
to
come
from
a
distance
.
When
he
ceased
he
lay
with
his
face
*NL*
turned
to
Isabel
and
his
large
unwinking
eyes
open
into
her
own
.
``
It
*NL*
was
very
good
of
you
to
come
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
I
thought
you
would
;
but
I
*NL*
was
n't
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
sure
either
till
I
came
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
like
an
angel
beside
my
bed
.
You
know
they
talk
about
the
*NL*
angel
of
death
.
It
's
the
most
beautiful
of
all
.
You
've
been
like
that
;
*NL*
as
if
you
were
waiting
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
waiting
for
your
death
;
I
was
waiting
for
--
for
this
.
This
is
*NL*
not
death
,
dear
Ralph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
you
--
no
.
There
's
nothing
makes
us
feel
so
much
alive
as
to
see
*NL*
others
die
.
That
's
the
sensation
of
life
--
the
sense
that
we
remain
.
I
've
*NL*
had
it
--
even
I
.
But
now
I
'm
of
no
use
but
to
give
it
to
others
.
With
me
*NL*
it
's
all
over
.
''
And
then
he
paused
.
Isabel
bowed
her
head
further
,
till
*NL*
it
rested
on
the
two
hands
that
were
clasped
upon
his
own
.
She
could
n't
*NL*
see
him
now
;
but
his
far-away
voice
was
close
to
her
ear
.
``
Isabel
,
''
he
*NL*
went
on
suddenly
,
``
I
wish
it
were
over
for
you
.
''
She
answered
nothing
;
*NL*
she
had
burst
into
sobs
;
she
remained
so
,
with
her
buried
face
.
He
lay
*NL*
silent
,
listening
to
her
sobs
;
at
last
he
gave
a
long
groan
.
``
Ah
,
what
*NL*
is
it
you
have
done
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
did
for
me
?
''
she
cried
,
her
now
extreme
agitation
half
*NL*
smothered
by
her
attitude
.
She
had
lost
all
her
shame
,
all
wish
to
hide
*NL*
things
.
Now
he
must
know
;
she
wished
him
to
know
,
for
it
brought
them
*NL*
supremely
together
,
and
he
was
beyond
the
reach
of
pain
.
``
You
did
*NL*
something
once
--
you
know
it
.
O
Ralph
,
you
've
been
everything
!
What
have
*NL*
I
done
for
you
--
what
can
I
do
to-day
?
I
would
die
if
you
could
live
.
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
wish
you
to
live
;
I
would
die
myself
,
not
to
lose
you
.
''
Her
*NL*
voice
was
as
broken
as
his
own
and
full
of
tears
and
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
lose
me
--
you
'll
keep
me
.
Keep
me
in
your
heart
;
I
shall
be
*NL*
nearer
to
you
than
I
've
ever
been
.
Dear
Isabel
,
life
is
better
;
for
in
*NL*
life
there
's
love
.
Death
is
good
--
but
there
's
no
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
thanked
you
--
I
never
spoke
--
I
never
was
what
I
should
be
!
''
*NL*
Isabel
went
on
.
She
felt
a
passionate
need
to
cry
out
and
accuse
*NL*
herself
,
to
let
her
sorrow
possess
her
.
All
her
troubles
,
for
the
*NL*
moment
,
became
single
and
melted
together
into
this
present
pain
.
``
What
*NL*
must
you
have
thought
of
me
?
Yet
how
could
I
know
?
I
never
knew
,
and
I
*NL*
only
know
to-day
because
there
are
people
less
stupid
than
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
people
,
''
said
Ralph
.
``
I
think
I
'm
glad
to
leave
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
head
and
her
clasped
hands
;
she
seemed
for
a
moment
to
*NL*
pray
to
him
.
``
Is
it
true
--
is
it
true
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
that
you
've
been
stupid
?
Oh
no
,
''
said
Ralph
with
a
sensible
*NL*
intention
of
wit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
made
me
rich
--
that
all
I
have
is
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
his
head
,
and
for
some
time
said
nothing
.
Then
at
last
:
*NL*
``
Ah
,
do
n't
speak
of
that
--
that
was
not
happy
.
''
Slowly
he
moved
his
face
*NL*
toward
her
again
,
and
they
once
more
saw
each
other
.
``
But
for
that
--
but
*NL*
for
that
--
!
''
And
he
paused
.
``
I
believe
I
ruined
you
,
''
he
wailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
full
of
the
sense
that
he
was
beyond
the
reach
of
pain
;
he
*NL*
seemed
already
so
little
of
this
world
.
But
even
if
she
had
not
had
*NL*
it
she
would
still
have
spoken
,
for
nothing
mattered
now
but
the
only
*NL*
knowledge
that
was
not
pure
anguish
--
the
knowledge
that
they
were
*NL*
looking
at
the
truth
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
married
me
for
the
money
,
''
she
said
.
She
wished
to
say
everything
;
*NL*
she
was
afraid
he
might
die
before
she
had
done
so
.
He
gazed
at
her
a
*NL*
little
,
and
for
the
first
time
his
fixed
eyes
lowered
their
lids
.
But
he
*NL*
raised
them
in
a
moment
,
and
then
,
``
He
was
greatly
in
love
with
you
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
was
in
love
with
me
.
But
he
would
n't
have
married
me
if
I
had
*NL*
been
poor
.
I
do
n't
hurt
you
in
saying
that
.
How
can
I
?
I
only
want
you
*NL*
to
understand
.
I
always
tried
to
keep
you
from
understanding
;
but
that
's
*NL*
all
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
understood
,
''
said
Ralph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
did
,
and
I
did
n't
like
it
.
But
now
I
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
hurt
me
--
you
make
me
very
happy
.
''
And
as
Ralph
said
this
*NL*
there
was
an
extraordinary
gladness
in
his
voice
.
She
bent
her
*NL*
head
again
,
and
pressed
her
lips
to
the
back
of
his
hand
.
``
I
always
*NL*
understood
,
''
he
continued
,
``
though
it
was
so
strange
--
so
pitiful
.
You
*NL*
wanted
to
look
at
life
for
yourself
--
but
you
were
not
allowed
;
you
*NL*
were
punished
for
your
wish
.
You
were
ground
in
the
very
mill
of
the
*NL*
conventional
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
've
been
punished
,
''
Isabel
sobbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
to
her
a
little
,
and
then
continued
:
``
Was
he
very
bad
about
*NL*
your
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
made
it
very
hard
for
me
.
But
I
do
n't
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
over
then
between
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
;
I
do
n't
think
anything
's
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
back
to
him
?
''
Ralph
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
I
ca
n't
tell
.
I
shall
stay
here
as
long
as
I
may
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
think
--
I
need
n't
think
.
I
do
n't
care
for
anything
but
you
,
and
*NL*
that
's
enough
for
the
present
.
It
will
last
a
little
yet
.
Here
on
my
*NL*
knees
,
with
you
dying
in
my
arms
,
I
'm
happier
than
I
have
been
for
a
*NL*
long
time
.
And
I
want
you
to
be
happy
--
not
to
think
of
anything
sad
;
*NL*
only
to
feel
that
I
'm
near
you
and
I
love
you
.
Why
should
there
be
*NL*
pain
--
?
In
such
hours
as
this
what
have
we
to
do
with
pain
?
That
's
not
*NL*
the
deepest
thing
;
there
's
something
deeper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
evidently
found
from
moment
to
moment
greater
difficulty
in
*NL*
speaking
;
he
had
to
wait
longer
to
collect
himself
.
At
first
he
appeared
*NL*
to
make
no
response
to
these
last
words
;
he
let
a
long
time
elapse
.
Then
*NL*
he
murmured
simply
:
``
You
must
stay
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
stay
--
as
long
as
seems
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
seems
right
--
as
seems
right
?
''
He
repeated
her
words
.
``
Yes
,
you
think
*NL*
a
great
deal
about
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
one
must
.
You
're
very
tired
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
tired
.
You
said
just
now
that
pain
's
not
the
deepest
thing
.
*NL*
No
--
no
.
But
it
's
very
deep
.
If
I
could
stay
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
you
'll
always
be
here
,
''
she
softly
interrupted
.
It
was
easy
to
*NL*
interrupt
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
went
on
,
after
a
moment
:
``
It
passes
,
after
all
;
it
's
passing
now
.
*NL*
But
love
remains
.
I
do
n't
know
why
we
should
suffer
so
much
.
Perhaps
I
*NL*
shall
find
out
.
There
are
many
things
in
life
.
You
're
very
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
very
old
,
''
said
Isabel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
grow
young
again
.
That
's
how
I
see
you
.
I
do
n't
believe
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
--
''
But
he
stopped
again
;
his
strength
failed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
begged
him
to
be
quiet
now
.
``
We
need
n't
speak
to
understand
each
*NL*
other
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
that
such
a
generous
mistake
as
yours
can
hurt
you
for
*NL*
more
than
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Ralph
,
I
'm
very
happy
now
,
''
she
cried
through
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
remember
this
,
''
he
continued
,
``
that
if
you
've
been
hated
*NL*
you
've
also
been
loved
.
Ah
but
,
Isabel
--
ADORED
!
''
he
just
audibly
and
*NL*
lingeringly
breathed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
my
brother
!
''
she
cried
with
a
movement
of
still
deeper
prostration
.

CHAPTER
LV
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
told
her
,
the
first
evening
she
ever
spent
at
Gardencourt
,
that
*NL*
if
she
should
live
to
suffer
enough
she
might
some
day
see
the
ghost
*NL*
with
which
the
old
house
was
duly
provided
.
She
apparently
had
fulfilled
*NL*
the
necessary
condition
;
for
the
next
morning
,
in
the
cold
,
faint
*NL*
dawn
,
she
knew
that
a
spirit
was
standing
by
her
bed
.
She
had
lain
down
*NL*
without
undressing
,
it
being
her
belief
that
Ralph
would
not
outlast
*NL*
the
night
.
She
had
no
inclination
to
sleep
;
she
was
waiting
,
and
such
*NL*
waiting
was
wakeful
.
But
she
closed
her
eyes
;
she
believed
that
as
the
*NL*
night
wore
on
she
should
hear
a
knock
at
her
door
.
She
heard
no
knock
,
*NL*
but
at
the
time
the
darkness
began
vaguely
to
grow
grey
she
started
up
*NL*
from
her
pillow
as
abruptly
as
if
she
had
received
a
summons
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
her
for
an
instant
that
he
was
standing
there
--
a
vague
,
hovering
*NL*
figure
in
the
vagueness
of
the
room
.
She
stared
a
moment
;
she
saw
his
*NL*
white
face
--
his
kind
eyes
;
then
she
saw
there
was
nothing
.
She
was
not
*NL*
afraid
;
she
was
only
sure
.
She
quitted
the
place
and
in
her
certainty
*NL*
passed
through
dark
corridors
and
down
a
flight
of
oaken
steps
that
*NL*
shone
in
the
vague
light
of
a
hall-window
.
Outside
Ralph
's
door
she
*NL*
stopped
a
moment
,
listening
,
but
she
seemed
to
hear
only
the
hush
that
*NL*
filled
it
.
She
opened
the
door
with
a
hand
as
gentle
as
if
she
were
*NL*
lifting
a
veil
from
the
face
of
the
dead
,
and
saw
Mrs.
Touchett
sitting
*NL*
motionless
and
upright
beside
the
couch
of
her
son
,
with
one
of
his
*NL*
hands
in
her
own
.
The
doctor
was
on
the
other
side
,
with
poor
Ralph
's
*NL*
further
wrist
resting
in
his
professional
fingers
.
The
two
nurses
were
*NL*
at
the
foot
between
them
.
Mrs.
Touchett
took
no
notice
of
Isabel
,
but
*NL*
the
doctor
looked
at
her
very
hard
;
then
he
gently
placed
Ralph
's
hand
*NL*
in
a
proper
position
,
close
beside
him
.
The
nurse
looked
at
her
very
*NL*
hard
too
,
and
no
one
said
a
word
;
but
Isabel
only
looked
at
what
she
had
*NL*
come
to
see
.
It
was
fairer
than
Ralph
had
ever
been
in
life
,
and
there
*NL*
was
a
strange
resemblance
to
the
face
of
his
father
,
which
,
six
years
*NL*
before
,
she
had
seen
lying
on
the
same
pillow
.
She
went
to
her
aunt
*NL*
and
put
her
arm
around
her
;
and
Mrs.
Touchett
,
who
as
a
general
thing
*NL*
neither
invited
nor
enjoyed
caresses
,
submitted
for
a
moment
to
this
*NL*
one
,
rising
,
as
might
be
,
to
take
it
.
But
she
was
stiff
and
dry-eyed
;
*NL*
her
acute
white
face
was
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Aunt
Lydia
,
''
Isabel
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
thank
God
you
've
no
child
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
,
disengaging
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
after
this
a
considerable
number
of
people
found
time
,
at
the
*NL*
height
of
the
London
``
season
,
''
to
take
a
morning
train
down
to
a
quiet
*NL*
station
in
Berkshire
and
spend
half
an
hour
in
a
small
grey
church
which
*NL*
stood
within
an
easy
walk
.
It
was
in
the
green
burial-place
of
this
*NL*
edifice
that
Mrs.
Touchett
consigned
her
son
to
earth
.
She
stood
herself
*NL*
at
the
edge
of
the
grave
,
and
Isabel
stood
beside
her
;
the
sexton
*NL*
himself
had
not
a
more
practical
interest
in
the
scene
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
.
It
was
a
solemn
occasion
,
but
neither
a
harsh
nor
a
heavy
one
;
*NL*
there
was
a
certain
geniality
in
the
appearance
of
things
.
The
weather
*NL*
had
changed
to
fair
;
the
day
,
one
of
the
last
of
the
treacherous
*NL*
May-time
,
was
warm
and
windless
,
and
the
air
had
the
brightness
of
the
*NL*
hawthorn
and
the
blackbird
.
If
it
was
sad
to
think
of
poor
Touchett
,
it
*NL*
was
not
too
sad
,
since
death
,
for
him
,
had
had
no
violence
.
He
had
been
*NL*
dying
so
long
;
he
was
so
ready
;
everything
had
been
so
expected
and
*NL*
prepared
.
There
were
tears
in
Isabel
's
eyes
,
but
they
were
not
tears
*NL*
that
blinded
.
She
looked
through
them
at
the
beauty
of
the
day
,
the
*NL*
splendour
of
nature
,
the
sweetness
of
the
old
English
churchyard
,
the
*NL*
bowed
heads
of
good
friends
.
Lord
Warburton
was
there
,
and
a
group
*NL*
of
gentlemen
all
unknown
to
her
,
several
of
whom
,
as
she
afterwards
*NL*
learned
,
were
connected
with
the
bank
;
and
there
were
others
whom
she
*NL*
knew
.
Miss
Stackpole
was
among
the
first
,
with
honest
Mr.
Bantling
*NL*
beside
her
;
and
Caspar
Goodwood
,
lifting
his
head
higher
than
the
*NL*
rest
--
bowing
it
rather
less
.
During
much
of
the
time
Isabel
was
*NL*
conscious
of
Mr.
Goodwood
's
gaze
;
he
looked
at
her
somewhat
harder
than
*NL*
he
usually
looked
in
public
,
while
the
others
had
fixed
their
eyes
upon
*NL*
the
churchyard
turf
.
But
she
never
let
him
see
that
she
saw
him
;
she
*NL*
thought
of
him
only
to
wonder
that
he
was
still
in
England
.
She
found
*NL*
she
had
taken
for
granted
that
after
accompanying
Ralph
to
Gardencourt
*NL*
he
had
gone
away
;
she
remembered
how
little
it
was
a
country
that
*NL*
pleased
him
.
He
was
there
,
however
,
very
distinctly
there
;
and
*NL*
something
in
his
attitude
seemed
to
say
that
he
was
there
with
a
complex
*NL*
intention
.
She
would
n't
meet
his
eyes
,
though
there
was
doubtless
*NL*
sympathy
in
them
;
he
made
her
rather
uneasy
.
With
the
dispersal
of
the
*NL*
little
group
he
disappeared
,
and
the
only
person
who
came
to
speak
to
*NL*
her
--
though
several
spoke
to
Mrs.
Touchett
--
was
Henrietta
Stackpole
.
*NL*
Henrietta
had
been
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
had
said
to
Isabel
that
he
hoped
she
would
remain
at
Gardencourt
,
*NL*
and
she
made
no
immediate
motion
to
leave
the
place
.
She
said
to
herself
*NL*
that
it
was
but
common
charity
to
stay
a
little
with
her
aunt
.
It
was
*NL*
fortunate
she
had
so
good
a
formula
;
otherwise
she
might
have
been
*NL*
greatly
in
want
of
one
.
Her
errand
was
over
;
she
had
done
what
she
had
*NL*
left
her
husband
to
do
.
She
had
a
husband
in
a
foreign
city
,
counting
*NL*
the
hours
of
her
absence
;
in
such
a
case
one
needed
an
excellent
motive
.
*NL*
He
was
not
one
of
the
best
husbands
,
but
that
did
n't
alter
the
case
.
*NL*
Certain
obligations
were
involved
in
the
very
fact
of
marriage
,
and
were
*NL*
quite
independent
of
the
quantity
of
enjoyment
extracted
from
it
.
Isabel
*NL*
thought
of
her
husband
as
little
as
might
be
;
but
now
that
she
was
at
a
*NL*
distance
,
beyond
its
spell
,
she
thought
with
a
kind
of
spiritual
shudder
*NL*
of
Rome
.
There
was
a
penetrating
chill
in
the
image
,
and
she
drew
*NL*
back
into
the
deepest
shade
of
Gardencourt
.
She
lived
from
day
to
day
,
*NL*
postponing
,
closing
her
eyes
,
trying
not
to
think
.
She
knew
she
must
*NL*
decide
,
but
she
decided
nothing
;
her
coming
itself
had
not
been
a
*NL*
decision
.
On
that
occasion
she
had
simply
started
.
Osmond
gave
no
sound
*NL*
and
now
evidently
would
give
none
;
he
would
leave
it
all
to
her
.
From
*NL*
Pansy
she
heard
nothing
,
but
that
was
very
simple
:
her
father
had
told
*NL*
her
not
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
accepted
Isabel
's
company
,
but
offered
her
no
assistance
;
*NL*
she
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
considering
,
without
enthusiasm
but
*NL*
with
perfect
lucidity
,
the
new
conveniences
of
her
own
situation
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
was
not
an
optimist
,
but
even
from
painful
occurrences
she
*NL*
managed
to
extract
a
certain
utility
.
This
consisted
in
the
reflexion
*NL*
that
,
after
all
,
such
things
happened
to
other
people
and
not
to
*NL*
herself
.
Death
was
disagreeable
,
but
in
this
case
it
was
her
son
's
*NL*
death
,
not
her
own
;
she
had
never
flattered
herself
that
her
own
would
*NL*
be
disagreeable
to
any
one
but
Mrs.
Touchett
.
She
was
better
off
than
*NL*
poor
Ralph
,
who
had
left
all
the
commodities
of
life
behind
him
,
*NL*
and
indeed
all
the
security
;
since
the
worst
of
dying
was
,
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
's
mind
,
that
it
exposed
one
to
be
taken
advantage
of
.
For
*NL*
herself
she
was
on
the
spot
;
there
was
nothing
so
good
as
that
.
She
*NL*
made
known
to
Isabel
very
punctually
--
it
was
the
evening
her
son
was
*NL*
buried
--
several
of
Ralph
's
testamentary
arrangements
.
He
had
told
her
*NL*
everything
,
had
consulted
her
about
everything
.
He
left
her
no
money
;
*NL*
of
course
she
had
no
need
of
money
.
He
left
her
the
furniture
of
*NL*
Gardencourt
,
exclusive
of
the
pictures
and
books
and
the
use
of
the
*NL*
place
for
a
year
;
after
which
it
was
to
be
sold
.
The
money
produced
by
*NL*
the
sale
was
to
constitute
an
endowment
for
a
hospital
for
poor
persons
*NL*
suffering
from
the
malady
of
which
he
died
;
and
of
this
portion
of
the
*NL*
will
Lord
Warburton
was
appointed
executor
.
The
rest
of
his
property
,
*NL*
which
was
to
be
withdrawn
from
the
bank
,
was
disposed
of
in
various
*NL*
bequests
,
several
of
them
to
those
cousins
in
Vermont
to
whom
his
*NL*
father
had
already
been
so
bountiful
.
Then
there
were
a
number
of
small
*NL*
legacies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
of
them
are
extremely
peculiar
,
''
said
Mrs.
Touchett
;
``
he
has
left
*NL*
considerable
sums
to
persons
I
never
heard
of
.
He
gave
me
a
list
,
and
I
*NL*
asked
then
who
some
of
them
were
,
and
he
told
me
they
were
people
who
at
*NL*
various
times
had
seemed
to
like
him
.
Apparently
he
thought
you
did
n't
*NL*
like
him
,
for
he
has
n't
left
you
a
penny
.
It
was
his
opinion
that
you
*NL*
had
been
handsomely
treated
by
his
father
,
which
I
'm
bound
to
say
I
*NL*
think
you
were
--
though
I
do
n't
mean
that
I
ever
heard
him
complain
of
*NL*
it
.
The
pictures
are
to
be
dispersed
;
he
has
distributed
them
about
,
one
*NL*
by
one
,
as
little
keepsakes
.
The
most
valuable
of
the
collection
goes
to
*NL*
Lord
Warburton
.
And
what
do
you
think
he
has
done
with
his
library
?
*NL*
It
sounds
like
a
practical
joke
.
He
has
left
it
to
your
friend
Miss
*NL*
Stackpole
--
`
in
recognition
of
her
services
to
literature
.
'
Does
he
mean
*NL*
her
following
him
up
from
Rome
?
Was
that
a
service
to
literature
?
It
*NL*
contains
a
great
many
rare
and
valuable
books
,
and
as
she
ca
n't
carry
*NL*
it
about
the
world
in
her
trunk
he
recommends
her
to
sell
it
at
auction
.
*NL*
She
will
sell
it
of
course
at
Christie
's
,
and
with
the
proceeds
she
'll
*NL*
set
up
a
newspaper
.
Will
that
be
a
service
to
literature
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
Isabel
forbore
to
answer
,
as
it
exceeded
the
little
*NL*
interrogatory
to
which
she
had
deemed
it
necessary
to
submit
on
her
*NL*
arrival
.
Besides
,
she
had
never
been
less
interested
in
literature
than
*NL*
to-day
,
as
she
found
when
she
occasionally
took
down
from
the
shelf
one
*NL*
of
the
rare
and
valuable
volumes
of
which
Mrs.
Touchett
had
spoken
.
She
*NL*
was
quite
unable
to
read
;
her
attention
had
never
been
so
little
at
her
*NL*
command
.
One
afternoon
,
in
the
library
,
about
a
week
after
the
ceremony
*NL*
in
the
churchyard
,
she
was
trying
to
fix
it
for
an
hour
;
but
her
eyes
*NL*
often
wandered
from
the
book
in
her
hand
to
the
open
window
,
which
*NL*
looked
down
the
long
avenue
.
It
was
in
this
way
that
she
saw
a
modest
*NL*
vehicle
approach
the
door
and
perceived
Lord
Warburton
sitting
,
in
*NL*
rather
an
uncomfortable
attitude
,
in
a
corner
of
it
.
He
had
always
had
*NL*
a
high
standard
of
courtesy
,
and
it
was
therefore
not
remarkable
,
under
*NL*
the
circumstances
,
that
he
should
have
taken
the
trouble
to
come
down
*NL*
from
London
to
call
on
Mrs.
Touchett
.
It
was
of
course
Mrs.
Touchett
*NL*
he
had
come
to
see
,
and
not
Mrs.
Osmond
;
and
to
prove
to
herself
the
*NL*
validity
of
this
thesis
Isabel
presently
stepped
out
of
the
house
and
*NL*
wandered
away
into
the
park
.
Since
her
arrival
at
Gardencourt
she
*NL*
had
been
but
little
out
of
doors
,
the
weather
being
unfavourable
for
*NL*
visiting
the
grounds
.
This
evening
,
however
,
was
fine
,
and
at
first
it
*NL*
struck
her
as
a
happy
thought
to
have
come
out
.
The
theory
I
have
just
*NL*
mentioned
was
plausible
enough
,
but
it
brought
her
little
rest
,
and
*NL*
if
you
had
seen
her
pacing
about
you
would
have
said
she
had
a
bad
*NL*
conscience
.
She
was
not
pacified
when
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
,
finding
herself
in
view
of
the
house
,
she
saw
Mrs.
Touchett
emerge
*NL*
from
the
portico
accompanied
by
her
visitor
.
Her
aunt
had
evidently
*NL*
proposed
to
Lord
Warburton
that
they
should
come
in
search
of
her
.
She
*NL*
was
in
no
humour
for
visitors
and
,
if
she
had
had
a
chance
,
would
have
*NL*
drawn
back
behind
one
of
the
great
trees
.
But
she
saw
she
had
been
seen
*NL*
and
that
nothing
was
left
her
but
to
advance
.
As
the
lawn
at
Gardencourt
*NL*
was
a
vast
expanse
this
took
some
time
;
during
which
she
observed
that
,
*NL*
as
he
walked
beside
his
hostess
,
Lord
Warburton
kept
his
hands
rather
*NL*
stiffly
behind
him
and
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
.
Both
persons
apparently
*NL*
were
silent
;
but
Mrs.
Touchett
's
thin
little
glance
,
as
she
directed
it
*NL*
toward
Isabel
,
had
even
at
a
distance
an
expression
.
It
seemed
to
say
*NL*
with
cutting
sharpness
:
``
Here
's
the
eminently
amenable
nobleman
you
*NL*
might
have
married
!
''
When
Lord
Warburton
lifted
his
own
eyes
,
however
,
*NL*
that
was
not
what
they
said
.
They
only
said
``
This
is
rather
awkward
,
you
*NL*
know
,
and
I
depend
upon
you
to
help
me
.
''
He
was
very
grave
,
very
proper
*NL*
and
,
for
the
first
time
since
Isabel
had
known
him
,
greeted
her
without
*NL*
a
smile
.
Even
in
his
days
of
distress
he
had
always
begun
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
He
looked
extremely
selfconscious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
Warburton
has
been
so
good
as
to
come
out
to
see
me
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Touchett
.
``
He
tells
me
he
did
n't
know
you
were
still
here
.
I
know
he
's
*NL*
an
old
friend
of
yours
,
and
as
I
was
told
you
were
not
in
the
house
I
*NL*
brought
him
out
to
see
for
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
saw
there
was
a
good
train
at
6.40
,
that
would
get
me
back
*NL*
in
time
for
dinner
,
''
Mrs.
Touchett
's
companion
rather
irrelevantly
*NL*
explained
.
``
I
'm
so
glad
to
find
you
've
not
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
here
for
long
,
you
know
,
''
Isabel
said
with
a
certain
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
not
;
but
I
hope
it
's
for
some
weeks
.
You
came
to
England
*NL*
sooner
than
--
a
--
than
you
thought
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
came
very
suddenly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Touchett
turned
away
as
if
she
were
looking
at
the
condition
of
the
*NL*
grounds
,
which
indeed
was
not
what
it
should
be
,
while
Lord
Warburton
*NL*
hesitated
a
little
.
Isabel
fancied
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
asking
*NL*
about
her
husband
--
rather
confusedly
--
and
then
had
checked
himself
.
He
*NL*
continued
immitigably
grave
,
either
because
he
thought
it
becoming
in
a
*NL*
place
over
which
death
had
just
passed
,
or
for
more
personal
reasons
.
If
*NL*
he
was
conscious
of
personal
reasons
it
was
very
fortunate
that
he
had
*NL*
the
cover
of
the
former
motive
;
he
could
make
the
most
of
that
.
Isabel
*NL*
thought
of
all
this
.
It
was
not
that
his
face
was
sad
,
for
that
was
*NL*
another
matter
;
but
it
was
strangely
inexpressive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sisters
would
have
been
so
glad
to
come
if
they
had
known
you
were
*NL*
still
here
--
if
they
had
thought
you
would
see
them
,
''
Lord
Warburton
went
*NL*
on
.
``
Do
kindly
let
them
see
you
before
you
leave
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
give
me
great
pleasure
;
I
have
such
a
friendly
recollection
of
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
would
come
to
Lockleigh
for
a
day
or
two
?
*NL*
You
know
there
's
always
that
old
promise
.
''
And
his
lordship
coloured
a
*NL*
little
as
he
made
this
suggestion
,
which
gave
his
face
a
somewhat
more
*NL*
familiar
air
.
``
Perhaps
I
'm
not
right
in
saying
that
just
now
;
of
course
*NL*
you
're
not
thinking
of
visiting
.
But
I
meant
what
would
hardly
be
a
*NL*
visit
.
My
sisters
are
to
be
at
Lockleigh
at
Whitsuntide
for
five
days
;
*NL*
and
if
you
could
come
then
--
as
you
say
you
're
not
to
be
very
long
in
*NL*
England
--
I
would
see
that
there
should
be
literally
no
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
wondered
if
not
even
the
young
lady
he
was
to
marry
would
be
*NL*
there
with
her
mamma
;
but
she
did
not
express
this
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
extremely
,
''
she
contented
herself
with
saying
;
``
I
'm
afraid
I
*NL*
hardly
know
about
Whitsuntide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
your
promise
--
have
n't
I
?
--
for
some
other
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
interrogation
in
this
;
but
Isabel
let
it
pass
.
She
looked
*NL*
at
her
interlocutor
a
moment
,
and
the
result
of
her
observation
was
*NL*
that
--
as
had
happened
before
--
she
felt
sorry
for
him
.
``
Take
care
you
*NL*
do
n't
miss
your
train
,
''
she
said
.
And
then
she
added
:
``
I
wish
you
every
*NL*
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
blushed
again
,
more
than
before
,
and
he
looked
at
his
watch
.
``
Ah
yes
,
*NL*
6.40
;
I
have
n't
much
time
,
but
I
've
a
fly
at
the
door
.
Thank
you
very
*NL*
much
.
''
It
was
not
apparent
whether
the
thanks
applied
to
her
having
*NL*
reminded
him
of
his
train
or
to
the
more
sentimental
remark
.
``
Good-bye
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Osmond
;
good-bye
.
''
He
shook
hands
with
her
,
without
meeting
her
*NL*
eyes
,
and
then
he
turned
to
Mrs.
Touchett
,
who
had
wandered
back
to
*NL*
them
.
With
her
his
parting
was
equally
brief
;
and
in
a
moment
the
two
*NL*
ladies
saw
him
move
with
long
steps
across
the
lawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
very
sure
he
's
to
be
married
?
''
Isabel
asked
of
her
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
be
surer
than
he
;
but
he
seems
sure
.
I
congratulated
him
,
and
*NL*
he
accepted
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Isabel
,
``
I
give
it
up
!
''
--
while
her
aunt
returned
to
the
house
*NL*
and
to
those
avocations
which
the
visitor
had
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
it
up
,
but
she
still
thought
of
it
--
thought
of
it
while
she
*NL*
strolled
again
under
the
great
oaks
whose
shadows
were
long
upon
the
*NL*
acres
of
turf
.
At
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
she
found
herself
near
a
*NL*
rustic
bench
,
which
,
a
moment
after
she
had
looked
at
it
,
struck
her
as
*NL*
an
object
recognised
.
It
was
not
simply
that
she
had
seen
it
before
,
*NL*
nor
even
that
she
had
sat
upon
it
;
it
was
that
on
this
spot
something
*NL*
important
had
happened
to
her
--
that
the
place
had
an
air
of
association
.
*NL*
Then
she
remembered
that
she
had
been
sitting
there
,
six
years
before
,
*NL*
when
a
servant
brought
her
from
the
house
the
letter
in
which
Caspar
*NL*
Goodwood
informed
her
that
he
had
followed
her
to
Europe
;
and
that
when
*NL*
she
had
read
the
letter
she
looked
up
to
hear
Lord
Warburton
announcing
*NL*
that
he
should
like
to
marry
her
.
It
was
indeed
an
historical
,
an
*NL*
interesting
,
bench
;
she
stood
and
looked
at
it
as
if
it
might
have
*NL*
something
to
say
to
her
.
She
would
n't
sit
down
on
it
now
--
she
felt
*NL*
rather
afraid
of
it
.
She
only
stood
before
it
,
and
while
she
stood
the
*NL*
past
came
back
to
her
in
one
of
those
rushing
waves
of
emotion
by
which
*NL*
persons
of
sensibility
are
visited
at
odd
hours
.
The
effect
of
this
*NL*
agitation
was
a
sudden
sense
of
being
very
tired
,
under
the
influence
*NL*
of
which
she
overcame
her
scruples
and
sank
into
the
rustic
seat
.
I
have
*NL*
said
that
she
was
restless
and
unable
to
occupy
herself
;
and
whether
or
*NL*
no
,
if
you
had
seen
her
there
,
you
would
have
admired
the
justice
of
the
*NL*
former
epithet
,
you
would
at
least
have
allowed
that
at
this
moment
*NL*
she
was
the
image
of
a
victim
of
idleness
.
Her
attitude
had
a
singular
*NL*
absence
of
purpose
;
her
hands
,
hanging
at
her
sides
,
lost
themselves
in
*NL*
the
folds
of
her
black
dress
;
her
eyes
gazed
vaguely
before
her
.
*NL*
There
was
nothing
to
recall
her
to
the
house
;
the
two
ladies
,
in
their
*NL*
seclusion
,
dined
early
and
had
tea
at
an
indefinite
hour
.
How
long
she
*NL*
had
sat
in
this
position
she
could
not
have
told
you
;
but
the
twilight
*NL*
had
grown
thick
when
she
became
aware
that
she
was
not
alone
.
She
*NL*
quickly
straightened
herself
,
glancing
about
,
and
then
saw
what
had
*NL*
become
of
her
solitude
.
She
was
sharing
it
with
Caspar
Goodwood
,
*NL*
who
stood
looking
at
her
,
a
few
yards
off
,
and
whose
footfall
on
the
*NL*
unresonant
turf
,
as
he
came
near
,
she
had
not
heard
.
It
occurred
to
her
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
this
that
it
was
just
so
Lord
Warburton
had
surprised
*NL*
her
of
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
instantly
rose
,
and
as
soon
as
Goodwood
saw
he
was
seen
he
started
*NL*
forward
.
She
had
had
time
only
to
rise
when
,
with
a
motion
that
looked
*NL*
like
violence
,
but
felt
like
--
she
knew
not
what
,
he
grasped
her
by
the
*NL*
wrist
and
made
her
sink
again
into
the
seat
.
She
closed
her
eyes
;
he
had
*NL*
not
hurt
her
;
it
was
only
a
touch
,
which
she
had
obeyed
.
But
there
was
*NL*
something
in
his
face
that
she
wished
not
to
see
.
That
was
the
way
he
*NL*
had
looked
at
her
the
other
day
in
the
churchyard
;
only
at
present
*NL*
it
was
worse
.
He
said
nothing
at
first
;
she
only
felt
him
close
to
*NL*
her
--
beside
her
on
the
bench
and
pressingly
turned
to
her
.
It
almost
*NL*
seemed
to
her
that
no
one
had
ever
been
so
close
to
her
as
that
.
*NL*
All
this
,
however
,
took
but
an
instant
,
at
the
end
of
which
she
had
*NL*
disengaged
her
wrist
,
turning
her
eyes
upon
her
visitant
.
``
You
've
*NL*
frightened
me
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mean
to
,
''
he
answered
,
``
but
if
I
did
a
little
,
no
matter
.
*NL*
I
came
from
London
a
while
ago
by
the
train
,
but
I
could
n't
come
here
*NL*
directly
.
There
was
a
man
at
the
station
who
got
ahead
of
me
.
He
took
*NL*
a
fly
that
was
there
,
and
I
heard
him
give
the
order
to
drive
here
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
who
he
was
,
but
I
did
n't
want
to
come
with
him
;
I
wanted
to
*NL*
see
you
alone
.
So
I
've
been
waiting
and
walking
about
.
I
've
walked
all
*NL*
over
,
and
I
was
just
coming
to
the
house
when
I
saw
you
here
.
There
was
*NL*
a
keeper
,
or
someone
,
who
met
me
;
but
that
was
all
right
,
because
I
*NL*
had
made
his
acquaintance
when
I
came
here
with
your
cousin
.
Is
that
*NL*
gentleman
gone
?
Are
you
really
alone
?
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
''
Goodwood
*NL*
spoke
very
fast
;
he
was
as
excited
as
when
they
had
parted
in
Rome
.
*NL*
Isabel
had
hoped
that
condition
would
subside
;
and
she
shrank
into
*NL*
herself
as
she
perceived
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
had
only
let
out
*NL*
sail
.
She
had
a
new
sensation
;
he
had
never
produced
it
before
;
it
was
*NL*
a
feeling
of
danger
.
There
was
indeed
something
really
formidable
in
his
*NL*
resolution
.
She
gazed
straight
before
her
;
he
,
with
a
hand
on
each
knee
,
*NL*
leaned
forward
,
looking
deeply
into
her
face
.
The
twilight
seemed
*NL*
to
darken
round
them
.
``
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
''
he
repeated
;
``
I
've
*NL*
something
particular
to
say
.
I
do
n't
want
to
trouble
you
--
as
I
did
*NL*
the
other
day
in
Rome
.
That
was
of
no
use
;
it
only
distressed
you
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
help
it
;
I
knew
I
was
wrong
.
But
I
'm
not
wrong
now
;
please
*NL*
do
n't
think
I
am
,
''
he
went
on
with
his
hard
,
deep
voice
melting
a
moment
*NL*
into
entreaty
.
``
I
came
here
to-day
for
a
purpose
.
It
's
very
different
.
*NL*
It
was
vain
for
me
to
speak
to
you
then
;
but
now
I
can
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
n't
have
told
you
whether
it
was
because
she
was
afraid
,
or
*NL*
because
such
a
voice
in
the
darkness
seemed
of
necessity
a
boon
;
but
she
*NL*
listened
to
him
as
she
had
never
listened
before
;
his
words
dropped
deep
*NL*
into
her
soul
.
They
produced
a
sort
of
stillness
in
all
her
being
;
and
*NL*
it
was
with
an
effort
,
in
a
moment
,
that
she
answered
him
.
``
How
can
you
*NL*
help
me
?
''
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
,
as
if
she
were
taking
what
he
had
*NL*
said
seriously
enough
to
make
the
enquiry
in
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
inducing
you
to
trust
me
.
Now
I
know
--
to-day
I
know
.
Do
you
remember
*NL*
what
I
asked
you
in
Rome
?
Then
I
was
quite
in
the
dark
.
But
to-day
I
*NL*
know
on
good
authority
;
everything
's
clear
to
me
to-day
.
It
was
a
good
*NL*
thing
when
you
made
me
come
away
with
your
cousin
.
He
was
a
good
man
,
*NL*
a
fine
man
,
one
of
the
best
;
he
told
me
how
the
case
stands
for
you
.
He
*NL*
explained
everything
;
he
guessed
my
sentiments
.
He
was
a
member
of
*NL*
your
family
and
he
left
you
--
so
long
as
you
should
be
in
England
--
to
my
*NL*
care
,
''
said
Goodwood
as
if
he
were
making
a
great
point
.
``
Do
you
know
*NL*
what
he
said
to
me
the
last
time
I
saw
him
--
as
he
lay
there
where
he
*NL*
died
?
He
said
:
`
Do
everything
you
can
for
her
;
do
everything
she
'll
let
*NL*
you
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
suddenly
got
up
.
``
You
had
no
business
to
talk
about
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
--
why
not
,
when
we
talked
in
that
way
?
''
he
demanded
,
following
*NL*
her
fast
.
``
And
he
was
dying
--
when
a
man
's
dying
it
's
different
.
''
She
*NL*
checked
the
movement
she
had
made
to
leave
him
;
she
was
listening
more
*NL*
than
ever
;
it
was
true
that
he
was
not
the
same
as
that
last
time
.
That
*NL*
had
been
aimless
,
fruitless
passion
,
but
at
present
he
had
an
idea
,
*NL*
which
she
scented
in
all
her
being
.
``
But
it
does
n't
matter
!
''
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
pressing
her
still
harder
,
though
now
without
touching
a
hem
*NL*
of
her
garment
.
``
If
Touchett
had
never
opened
his
mouth
I
should
have
*NL*
known
all
the
same
.
I
had
only
to
look
at
you
at
your
cousin
's
funeral
*NL*
to
see
what
's
the
matter
with
you
.
You
ca
n't
deceive
me
any
more
;
for
*NL*
God
's
sake
be
honest
with
a
man
who
's
so
honest
with
you
.
You
're
the
*NL*
most
unhappy
of
women
,
and
your
husband
's
the
deadliest
of
fiends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
on
him
as
if
he
had
struck
her
.
``
Are
you
mad
?
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
been
so
sane
;
I
see
the
whole
thing
.
Do
n't
think
it
's
*NL*
necessary
to
defend
him
.
But
I
wo
n't
say
another
word
against
him
;
I
'll
*NL*
speak
only
of
you
,
''
Goodwood
added
quickly
.
``
How
can
you
pretend
you
're
*NL*
not
heart-broken
?
You
do
n't
know
what
to
do
--
you
do
n't
know
where
to
*NL*
turn
.
It
's
too
late
to
play
a
part
;
did
n't
you
leave
all
that
behind
you
*NL*
in
Rome
?
Touchett
knew
all
about
it
,
and
I
knew
it
too
--
what
it
*NL*
would
cost
you
to
come
here
.
It
will
have
cost
you
your
life
?
Say
it
*NL*
will
''
--
and
he
flared
almost
into
anger
:
``
give
me
one
word
of
truth
!
When
*NL*
I
know
such
a
horror
as
that
,
how
can
I
keep
myself
from
wishing
to
save
*NL*
you
?
What
would
you
think
of
me
if
I
should
stand
still
and
see
you
*NL*
go
back
to
your
reward
?
`
It
's
awful
,
what
she
'll
have
to
pay
for
*NL*
it
!
'
--
that
's
what
Touchett
said
to
me
.
I
may
tell
you
that
,
may
n't
I
?
He
*NL*
was
such
a
near
relation
!
''
cried
Goodwood
,
making
his
queer
grim
point
*NL*
again
.
``
I
'd
sooner
have
been
shot
than
let
another
man
say
those
things
*NL*
to
me
;
but
he
was
different
;
he
seemed
to
me
to
have
the
right
.
It
was
*NL*
after
he
got
home
--
when
he
saw
he
was
dying
,
and
when
I
saw
it
too
.
*NL*
I
understand
all
about
it
:
you
're
afraid
to
go
back
.
You
're
perfectly
*NL*
alone
;
you
do
n't
know
where
to
turn
.
You
ca
n't
turn
anywhere
;
you
know
*NL*
that
perfectly
.
Now
it
is
therefore
that
I
want
you
to
think
of
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
of
`
you
'
?
''
Isabel
said
,
standing
before
him
in
the
dusk
.
The
*NL*
idea
of
which
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
a
few
moments
before
now
loomed
*NL*
large
.
She
threw
back
her
head
a
little
;
she
stared
at
it
as
if
it
had
*NL*
been
a
comet
in
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
where
to
turn
.
Turn
straight
to
me
.
I
want
to
persuade
*NL*
you
to
trust
me
,
''
Goodwood
repeated
.
And
then
he
paused
with
his
shining
*NL*
eyes
.
``
Why
should
you
go
back
--
why
should
you
go
through
that
ghastly
*NL*
form
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
get
away
from
you
!
''
she
answered
.
But
this
expressed
only
a
little
*NL*
of
what
she
felt
.
The
rest
was
that
she
had
never
been
loved
before
.
She
*NL*
had
believed
it
,
but
this
was
different
;
this
was
the
hot
wind
of
the
*NL*
desert
,
at
the
approach
of
which
the
others
dropped
dead
,
like
mere
*NL*
sweet
airs
of
the
garden
.
It
wrapped
her
about
;
it
lifted
her
off
her
*NL*
feet
,
while
the
very
taste
of
it
,
as
of
something
potent
,
acrid
and
*NL*
strange
,
forced
open
her
set
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
in
rejoinder
to
what
she
had
said
,
it
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
he
would
break
out
into
greater
violence
.
But
after
an
instant
he
was
*NL*
perfectly
quiet
;
he
wished
to
prove
he
was
sane
,
that
he
had
reasoned
it
*NL*
all
out
.
``
I
want
to
prevent
that
,
and
I
think
I
may
,
if
you
'll
only
for
*NL*
once
listen
to
me
.
It
's
too
monstrous
of
you
to
think
of
sinking
back
*NL*
into
that
misery
,
of
going
to
open
your
mouth
to
that
poisoned
air
.
It
's
*NL*
you
that
are
out
of
your
mind
.
Trust
me
as
if
I
had
the
care
of
you
.
Why
*NL*
should
n't
we
be
happy
--
when
it
's
here
before
us
,
when
it
's
so
easy
?
I
'm
*NL*
yours
for
ever
--
for
ever
and
ever
.
Here
I
stand
;
I
'm
as
firm
as
a
rock
.
*NL*
What
have
you
to
care
about
?
You
've
no
children
;
that
perhaps
would
be
*NL*
an
obstacle
.
As
it
is
you
've
nothing
to
consider
.
You
must
save
what
you
*NL*
can
of
your
life
;
you
must
n't
lose
it
all
simply
because
you
've
lost
a
*NL*
part
.
It
would
be
an
insult
to
you
to
assume
that
you
care
for
the
look
*NL*
of
the
thing
,
for
what
people
will
say
,
for
the
bottomless
idiocy
of
the
*NL*
world
.
We
've
nothing
to
do
with
all
that
;
we
're
quite
out
of
it
;
we
look
*NL*
at
things
as
they
are
.
You
took
the
great
step
in
coming
away
;
the
next
*NL*
is
nothing
;
it
's
the
natural
one
.
I
swear
,
as
I
stand
here
,
that
a
woman
*NL*
deliberately
made
to
suffer
is
justified
in
anything
in
life
--
in
going
*NL*
down
into
the
streets
if
that
will
help
her
!
I
know
how
you
suffer
,
and
*NL*
that
's
why
I
'm
here
.
We
can
do
absolutely
as
we
please
;
to
whom
under
*NL*
the
sun
do
we
owe
anything
?
What
is
it
that
holds
us
,
what
is
it
that
*NL*
has
the
smallest
right
to
interfere
in
such
a
question
as
this
?
Such
a
*NL*
question
is
between
ourselves
--
and
to
say
that
is
to
settle
it
!
Were
we
*NL*
born
to
rot
in
our
misery
--
were
we
born
to
be
afraid
?
I
never
knew
YOU
*NL*
afraid
!
If
you
'll
only
trust
me
,
how
little
you
will
be
disappointed
!
*NL*
The
world
's
all
before
us
--
and
the
world
's
very
big
.
I
know
something
*NL*
about
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Isabel
gave
a
long
murmur
,
like
a
creature
in
pain
;
it
was
as
if
he
were
*NL*
pressing
something
that
hurt
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
world
's
very
small
,
''
she
said
at
random
;
she
had
an
immense
*NL*
desire
to
appear
to
resist
.
She
said
it
at
random
,
to
hear
herself
say
*NL*
something
;
but
it
was
not
what
she
meant
.
The
world
,
in
truth
,
had
never
*NL*
seemed
so
large
;
it
seemed
to
open
out
,
all
round
her
,
to
take
the
form
*NL*
of
a
mighty
sea
,
where
she
floated
in
fathomless
waters
.
She
had
wanted
*NL*
help
,
and
here
was
help
;
it
had
come
in
a
rushing
torrent
.
I
know
not
*NL*
whether
she
believed
everything
he
said
;
but
she
believed
just
then
*NL*
that
to
let
him
take
her
in
his
arms
would
be
the
next
best
thing
to
her
*NL*
dying
.
This
belief
,
for
a
moment
,
was
a
kind
of
rapture
,
in
which
she
*NL*
felt
herself
sink
and
sink
.
In
the
movement
she
seemed
to
beat
with
her
*NL*
feet
,
in
order
to
catch
herself
,
to
feel
something
to
rest
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
be
mine
as
I
'm
yours
!
''
she
heard
her
companion
cry
.
He
had
suddenly
*NL*
given
up
argument
,
and
his
voice
seemed
to
come
,
harsh
and
terrible
,
*NL*
through
a
confusion
of
vaguer
sounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
however
,
of
course
,
was
but
a
subjective
fact
,
as
the
*NL*
metaphysicians
say
;
the
confusion
,
the
noise
of
waters
,
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
it
,
were
in
her
own
swimming
head
.
In
an
instant
she
became
aware
of
*NL*
this
.
``
Do
me
the
greatest
kindness
of
all
,
''
she
panted
.
``
I
beseech
you
*NL*
to
go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
do
n't
say
that
.
Do
n't
kill
me
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
clasped
her
hands
;
her
eyes
were
streaming
with
tears
.
``
As
you
love
*NL*
me
,
as
you
pity
me
,
leave
me
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glared
at
her
a
moment
through
the
dusk
,
and
the
next
instant
she
*NL*
felt
his
arms
about
her
and
his
lips
on
her
own
lips
.
His
kiss
was
like
*NL*
white
lightning
,
a
flash
that
spread
,
and
spread
again
,
and
stayed
;
and
*NL*
it
was
extraordinarily
as
if
,
while
she
took
it
,
she
felt
each
thing
in
*NL*
his
hard
manhood
that
had
least
pleased
her
,
each
aggressive
fact
of
his
*NL*
face
,
his
figure
,
his
presence
,
justified
of
its
intense
identity
and
*NL*
made
one
with
this
act
of
possession
.
So
had
she
heard
of
those
wrecked
*NL*
and
under
water
following
a
train
of
images
before
they
sink
.
But
when
*NL*
darkness
returned
she
was
free
.
She
never
looked
about
her
;
she
only
*NL*
darted
from
the
spot
.
There
were
lights
in
the
windows
of
the
house
;
*NL*
they
shone
far
across
the
lawn
.
In
an
extraordinarily
short
time
--
for
*NL*
the
distance
was
considerable
--
she
had
moved
through
the
darkness
-LRB-
for
*NL*
she
saw
nothing
-RRB-
and
reached
the
door
.
Here
only
she
paused
.
She
looked
*NL*
all
about
her
;
she
listened
a
little
;
then
she
put
her
hand
on
the
*NL*
latch
.
She
had
not
known
where
to
turn
;
but
she
knew
now
.
There
was
a
*NL*
very
straight
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
afterwards
Caspar
Goodwood
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
*NL*
Wimpole
Street
in
which
Henrietta
Stackpole
occupied
furnished
lodgings
.
*NL*
He
had
hardly
removed
his
hand
from
the
knocker
when
the
door
was
opened
*NL*
and
Miss
Stackpole
herself
stood
before
him
.
She
had
on
her
hat
and
*NL*
jacket
;
she
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
.
``
Oh
,
good-morning
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
I
was
in
hopes
I
should
find
Mrs.
Osmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
kept
him
waiting
a
moment
for
her
reply
;
but
there
was
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
expression
about
Miss
Stackpole
even
when
she
was
silent
.
``
Pray
*NL*
what
led
you
to
suppose
she
was
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
down
to
Gardencourt
this
morning
,
and
the
servant
told
me
she
*NL*
had
come
to
London
.
He
believed
she
was
to
come
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Miss
Stackpole
held
him
--
with
an
intention
of
perfect
kindness
--
in
*NL*
suspense
.
``
She
came
here
yesterday
,
and
spent
the
night
.
But
this
*NL*
morning
she
started
for
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Caspar
Goodwood
was
not
looking
at
her
;
his
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
*NL*
doorstep
.
``
Oh
,
she
started
--
?
''
he
stammered
.
And
without
finishing
*NL*
his
phrase
or
looking
up
he
stiffly
averted
himself
.
But
he
could
n't
*NL*
otherwise
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henrietta
had
come
out
,
closing
the
door
behind
her
,
and
now
she
put
out
*NL*
her
hand
and
grasped
his
arm
.
``
Look
here
,
Mr.
Goodwood
,
''
she
said
;
``
just
*NL*
you
wait
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
which
he
looked
up
at
her
--
but
only
to
guess
,
from
her
face
,
with
a
*NL*
revulsion
,
that
she
simply
meant
he
was
young
.
She
stood
shining
at
him
*NL*
with
that
cheap
comfort
,
and
it
added
,
on
the
spot
,
thirty
years
to
his
*NL*
life
.
She
walked
him
away
with
her
,
however
,
as
if
she
had
given
him
now
*NL*
the
key
to
patience
.
*NL*
