PRIDE
AND
PREJUDICE
*NL*
*NL*
By
Jane
Austen

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
1
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
truth
universally
acknowledged
,
that
a
single
man
in
possession
*NL*
of
a
good
fortune
,
must
be
in
want
of
a
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
little
known
the
feelings
or
views
of
such
a
man
may
be
on
his
*NL*
first
entering
a
neighbourhood
,
this
truth
is
so
well
fixed
in
the
minds
*NL*
of
the
surrounding
families
,
that
he
is
considered
the
rightful
property
*NL*
of
some
one
or
other
of
their
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Mr.
Bennet
,
''
said
his
lady
to
him
one
day
,
``
have
you
heard
that
*NL*
Netherfield
Park
is
let
at
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
replied
that
he
had
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
,
''
returned
she
;
``
for
Mrs.
Long
has
just
been
here
,
and
she
*NL*
told
me
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
want
to
know
who
has
taken
it
?
''
cried
his
wife
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
want
to
tell
me
,
and
I
have
no
objection
to
hearing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
invitation
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
dear
,
you
must
know
,
Mrs.
Long
says
that
Netherfield
is
taken
*NL*
by
a
young
man
of
large
fortune
from
the
north
of
England
;
that
he
came
*NL*
down
on
Monday
in
a
chaise
and
four
to
see
the
place
,
and
was
so
much
*NL*
delighted
with
it
,
that
he
agreed
with
Mr.
Morris
immediately
;
that
he
*NL*
is
to
take
possession
before
Michaelmas
,
and
some
of
his
servants
are
to
*NL*
be
in
the
house
by
the
end
of
next
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bingley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
married
or
single
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Single
,
my
dear
,
to
be
sure
!
A
single
man
of
large
fortune
;
four
or
*NL*
five
thousand
a
year
.
What
a
fine
thing
for
our
girls
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
How
can
it
affect
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Mr.
Bennet
,
''
replied
his
wife
,
``
how
can
you
be
so
tiresome
!
You
*NL*
must
know
that
I
am
thinking
of
his
marrying
one
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
his
design
in
settling
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Design
!
Nonsense
,
how
can
you
talk
so
!
But
it
is
very
likely
that
he
*NL*
_
may
_
fall
in
love
with
one
of
them
,
and
therefore
you
must
visit
him
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
no
occasion
for
that
.
You
and
the
girls
may
go
,
or
you
may
send
*NL*
them
by
themselves
,
which
perhaps
will
be
still
better
,
for
as
you
are
*NL*
as
handsome
as
any
of
them
,
Mr.
Bingley
may
like
you
the
best
of
the
*NL*
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
you
flatter
me
.
I
certainly
_
have
_
had
my
share
of
beauty
,
but
*NL*
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
anything
extraordinary
now
.
When
a
woman
has
five
*NL*
grown-up
daughters
,
she
ought
to
give
over
thinking
of
her
own
beauty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
such
cases
,
a
woman
has
not
often
much
beauty
to
think
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
,
you
must
indeed
go
and
see
Mr.
Bingley
when
he
comes
into
*NL*
the
neighbourhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
more
than
I
engage
for
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
consider
your
daughters
.
Only
think
what
an
establishment
it
would
*NL*
be
for
one
of
them

Sir
William
and
Lady
Lucas
are
determined
to
*NL*
go
,
merely
on
that
account
,
for
in
general
,
you
know
,
they
visit
no
*NL*
newcomers
.
Indeed
you
must
go

for
it
will
be
impossible
for

to
*NL*
visit
him
if
you
do
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
over-scrupulous
,
surely
.
I
dare
say
Mr.
Bingley
will
be
very
*NL*
glad
to
see
you
;
and
I
will
send
a
few
lines
by
you
to
assure
him
of
my
*NL*
hearty
consent
to
his
marrying
whichever
he
chooses
of
the
girls
;
though
*NL*
I
must
throw
in
a
good
word
for
my
little
Lizzy

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
desire
you
will
do
no
such
thing

Lizzy
is
not
a
bit
better
than
the
*NL*
others
;
and
I
am
sure
she
is
not
half
so
handsome
as
Jane
,
nor
half
so
*NL*
good-humoured
as
Lydia
.
But
you
are
always
giving
_
her
_
the
preference

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
none
of
them
much
to
recommend
them

''
replied
he
;
``
they
are
*NL*
all
silly
and
ignorant
like
other
girls

but
Lizzy
has
something
more
of
*NL*
quickness
than
her
sisters

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Bennet
,
how
_
can
_
you
abuse
your
own
children
in
such
a
way

take
delight
in
vexing
me

no
compassion

poor
nerves

*NL*
``
You
mistake
me
,
my

I
have
a
high
respect
for

are
my
old
friends
.
I
have
heard
you
mention
them
with
consideration
*NL*
these
last
twenty
years
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
do
not
know
what
I
suffer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
hope
you
will
get
over
it
,
and
live
to
see
many
young
men
of
four
*NL*
thousand
a
year
come
into
the
neighbourhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
no

twenty

*NL*
*NL*

Depend

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
was
so
odd
a
mixture
of
quick
parts
,
sarcastic
humour
,
*NL*
reserve
,
and
caprice
,
that
the
experience
of
three-and-twenty
years
had
*NL*
been
insufficient
to
make
his
wife
understand
his
character
.
_
Her
_
mind
*NL*
was
less
difficult
to
develop
.
She
was
a
woman
of
mean
understanding
,
*NL*
little
information
,
and
uncertain
temper
.
When
she
was
discontented
,
*NL*
she
fancied
herself
nervous
.
The
business
of
her
life
was
to
get
her
*NL*
daughters
married
;
its
solace
was
visiting
and
news
.

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
was
among
the
earliest
of
those
who
waited
on
Mr.
Bingley
.
He
*NL*
had
always
intended
to
visit
him
,
though
to
the
last
always
assuring
*NL*
his
wife
that
he
should
not
go
;
and
till
the
evening
after
the
visit
was
*NL*
paid
she
had
no
knowledge
of
it
.
It
was
then
disclosed
in
the
following
*NL*
manner
.
Observing
his
second
daughter
employed
in
trimming
a
hat
,
he
*NL*
suddenly
addressed
her
with
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
Mr.
Bingley
will
like
it
,
Lizzy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
in
a
way
to
know
_
what
_
Mr.
Bingley
likes
,
''
said
her
mother
*NL*
resentfully
,
``
since
we
are
not
to
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
forget
,
mamma
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
that
we
shall
meet
him
at
the
*NL*
assemblies
,
and
that
Mrs.
Long
promised
to
introduce
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
believe
Mrs.
Long
will
do
any
such
thing
.
She
has
two
nieces
*NL*
of
her
own
.
She
is
a
selfish
,
hypocritical
woman
,
and
I
have
no
opinion
*NL*
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
have
I
,
''
said
Mr.
Bennet
;
``
and
I
am
glad
to
find
that
you
do
*NL*
not
depend
on
her
serving
you

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
deigned
not
to
make
any
reply
,
but
,
unable
to
contain
*NL*
herself
,
began
scolding
one
of
her
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
keep
coughing
so

Kitty

for
Heaven
's

a
little

compassion

pieces

*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
has
no
discretion
in

her
father
;
``
she

*NL*
them
ill

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
cough

amusement

Kitty
fretfully
.
``
When

your
next
ball

be

*NL*
``
To-morrow

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

so
it
is

cried
her
mother
,
``
and
Mrs.
Long
does
not
come
back
*NL*
till
the
day
before

so
it
will
be
impossible
for

to
introduce
him

*NL*

she
will
not
know
him
herself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

dear
,
you
may
have
the
advantage
of
your
friend

introduce

Mr.

to
_
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible

Mr.

impossible

myself

can
you
be
so
teasing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
honour
your
circumspection

A
fortnight
's
acquaintance
is
certainly
*NL*
very
little

One
can
not
know
what
a
man
really
is
by
the
end
of
a
*NL*
fortnight

But
if
_
we
_
do
not
venture
somebody
else
will
;
and
after
all
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Long
and
her
neices
must
stand
their
chance
;
and
,
therefore
,
as
*NL*
she
will
think
it
an
act
of
kindness
,
if
you
decline
the
office

I
will
*NL*
take
it
on
myself

*NL*
The
girls
stared
at
their
father
.
Mrs.
Bennet
said
only
,
``
Nonsense
,
*NL*
nonsense
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
be
the
meaning
of
that
emphatic
exclamation

he

you
consider
the
forms

introduction

the
stress

is
laid
on

them

nonsense

I
can
not
quite
agree
with
you

there

What
say

,
*NL*
Mary
?
For
you
are
a
young
lady
of
deep
reflection

I
know

and
read
*NL*
great
books

make
extracts

*NL*
*NL*
Mary
wished
to
say
something
sensible
,
but
knew
not
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
Mary
is
adjusting
her
ideas

he
continued
,
``

return
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sick

his
wife

I
had
known
as
much
this
morning
I
certainly
would
not
have
called

on

It
is
very
unlucky

I
have
actually
paid

visit

can
not
escape

acquaintance
now

The
astonishment
of
the
ladies
was
just
what
he
wished
;
that
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
perhaps
surpassing
the
rest
;
though
,
when
the
first
tumult
of
joy
*NL*
was
over
,
she
began
to
declare
that
it
was
what
she
had
expected
all
the
*NL*
while

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
good

loved
your

too
well

*NL*
neglect
such
an
acquaintance

Well

how
pleased
I
am
!
and
it
is
such
a
*NL*
good
joke
,
too
,
that
you
should
have
gone
this
morning
and
never
said
a
*NL*
word
about
it
till
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Kitty
,
you
may
cough
as
much

you
choose

said
Mr.
Bennet
;
and
,
*NL*
as
he
spoke
,
he
left
the
room
,
fatigued
with
the
raptures
of
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
excellent
father

she
,
when

door
was

shut

for
that
matter

At

time

pleasant

can
tell

be
making
new

stoutly

The
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
conjecturing
how
soon
he
would
*NL*
return
Mr.

's
visit
,
and
determining
when
they
should
ask
him
to
*NL*
dinner

Not
all
that
Mrs.
Bennet
,
however
,
with
the
assistance
of
her
five
*NL*
daughters
,
could
ask
on
the
subject
,
was
sufficient
to
draw
from
her
*NL*
husband
any
satisfactory
description
of
Mr.
Bingley
.
They
attacked
him
*NL*
in
various
ways
--
with
barefaced
questions
,
ingenious
suppositions
,
and
*NL*
distant
surmises
;
but
he
eluded
the
skill
of
them
all
,
and
they
were
at
*NL*
last
obliged
to
accept
the
second-hand
intelligence
of
their
neighbour
,
*NL*
Lady
Lucas
.
Her
report
was
highly
favourable
.
Sir
William
had
been
*NL*
delighted
with
him
.
He
was
quite
young
,
wonderfully
handsome
,
extremely
*NL*
agreeable
,
and
,
to
crown
the
whole
,
he
meant
to
be
at
the
next
assembly
*NL*
with
a
large
party
.
Nothing
could
be
more
delightful
!
To
be
fond
of
*NL*
dancing
was
a
certain
step
towards
falling
in
love
;
and
very
lively
*NL*
hopes
of
Mr.
Bingley
's
heart
were
entertained
.

*NL*
said
Mrs.
Bennet
to
her
husband
,
``
and
all
the
others
equally
well
*NL*
married
,
I
shall
have
nothing
to
wish
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
days
Mr.
Bingley
returned
Mr.
Bennet
's
visit
,
and
sat
about
*NL*
ten
minutes
with
him
in
his
library
.
He
had
entertained
hopes
of
being
*NL*
admitted
to
a
sight
of
the
young
ladies
,
of
whose
beauty
he
had
*NL*
heard
much
;
but
he
saw
only
the
father
.
The
ladies
were
somewhat
more
*NL*
fortunate
,
for
they
had
the
advantage
of
ascertaining
from
an
upper
*NL*
window
that
he
wore
a
blue
coat
,
and
rode
a
black
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
invitation
to
dinner
was
soon
afterwards
dispatched
;
and
already
*NL*
had
Mrs.
Bennet
planned
the
courses
that
were
to
do
credit
to
her
*NL*
housekeeping
,
when
an
answer
arrived
which
deferred
it
all
.
Mr.
Bingley
*NL*
was
obliged
to
be
in
town
the
following
day
,
and
,
consequently
,
unable
*NL*
to
accept
the
honour
of
their
invitation
,
etc.
.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
quite
*NL*
disconcerted
.
She
could
not
imagine
what
business
he
could
have
in
town
*NL*
so
soon
after
his
arrival
in
Hertfordshire
;
and
she
began
to
fear
that
*NL*
he
might
be
always
flying
about
from
one
place
to
another
,
and
never
*NL*
settled
at
Netherfield
as
he
ought
to
be
.
Lady
Lucas
quieted
her
fears
*NL*
a
little
by
starting
the
idea
of
his
being
gone
to
London
only
to
get
*NL*
a
large
party
for
the
ball
;
and
a
report
soon
followed
that
Mr.
Bingley
*NL*
was
to
bring
twelve
ladies
and
seven
gentlemen
with
him
to
the
assembly
.
*NL*
The
girls
grieved
over
such
a
number
of
ladies
,
but
were
comforted
the
*NL*
day
before
the
ball
by
hearing
,
that
instead
of
twelve
he
brought
only
*NL*
six
with
him
from
London
--
his
five
sisters
and
a
cousin
.
And
when
*NL*
the
party
entered
the
assembly
room
it
consisted
of
only
five
*NL*
altogether
--
Mr.
Bingley
,
his
two
sisters
,
the
husband
of
the
eldest
,
and
*NL*
another
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bingley
was
good-looking
and
gentlemanlike
;
he
had
a
pleasant
*NL*
countenance
,
and
easy
,
unaffected
manners
.
His
sisters
were
fine
women
,
*NL*
with
an
air
of
decided
fashion
.
His
brother-in-law
,
Mr.
Hurst
,
merely
*NL*
looked
the
gentleman
;
but
his
friend
Mr.
Darcy
soon
drew
the
attention
*NL*
of
the
room
by
his
fine
,
tall
person
,
handsome
features
,
noble
mien
,
and
*NL*
the
report
which
was
in
general
circulation
within
five
minutes
*NL*
after
his
entrance
,
of
his
having
ten
thousand
a
year
.
The
gentlemen
*NL*
pronounced
him
to
be
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
,
the
ladies
declared
he
*NL*
was
much
handsomer
than
Mr.
Bingley
,
and
he
was
looked
at
with
great
*NL*
admiration
for
about
half
the
evening
,
till
his
manners
gave
a
disgust
*NL*
which
turned
the
tide
of
his
popularity
;
for
he
was
discovered
to
be
*NL*
proud
;
to
be
above
his
company
,
and
above
being
pleased
;
and
not
all
*NL*
his
large
estate
in
Derbyshire
could
then
save
him
from
having
a
most
*NL*
forbidding
,
disagreeable
countenance
,
and
being
unworthy
to
be
compared
*NL*
with
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bingley
had
soon
made
himself
acquainted
with
all
the
principal
*NL*
people
in
the
room
;
he
was
lively
and
unreserved
,
danced
every
dance
,
*NL*
was
angry
that
the
ball
closed
so
early
,
and
talked
of
giving
*NL*
one
himself
at
Netherfield
.
Such
amiable
qualities
must
speak
for
*NL*
themselves
.
What
a
contrast
between
him
and
his
friend
!
Mr.
Darcy
danced
*NL*
only
once
with
Mrs.
Hurst
and
once
with
Miss
Bingley
,
declined
being
*NL*
introduced
to
any
other
lady
,
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
*NL*
walking
about
the
room
,
speaking
occasionally
to
one
of
his
own
party
.
*NL*
His
character
was
decided
.
He
was
the
proudest
,
most
disagreeable
man
*NL*
in
the
world
,
and
everybody
hoped
that
he
would
never
come
there
again
.
*NL*
Amongst
the
most
violent
against
him
was
Mrs.
Bennet
,
whose
dislike
of
*NL*
his
general
behaviour
was
sharpened
into
particular
resentment
by
his
*NL*
having
slighted
one
of
her
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
Bennet
had
been
obliged
,
by
the
scarcity
of
gentlemen
,
to
sit
*NL*
down
for
two
dances
;
and
during
part
of
that
time
,
Mr.
Darcy
had
been
*NL*
standing
near
enough
for
her
to
hear
a
conversation
between
him
and
Mr.
*NL*
Bingley
,
who
came
from
the
dance
for
a
few
minutes
,
to
press
his
friend
*NL*
to
join
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Darcy
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
must
have
you
dance
.
I
hate
to
see
you
*NL*
standing
about
by
yourself
in
this
stupid
manner
.
You
had
much
better
*NL*
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
shall
not
.
You
know
how
I
detest
it
,
unless
I
am
*NL*
particularly
acquainted
with
my
partner
.
At
such
an
assembly
as
this
*NL*
it
would
be
insupportable
.
Your
sisters
are
engaged
,
and
there
is
not
*NL*
another
woman
in
the
room
whom
it
would
not
be
a
punishment
to
me
to
*NL*
stand
up
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
be
so
fastidious
as
you
are
,
''
cried
Mr.
Bingley
,
``
for
a
*NL*
kingdom
!
Upon
my
honour
,
I
never
met
with
so
many
pleasant
girls
in
*NL*
my
life
as
I
have
this
evening
;
and
there
are
several
of
them
you
see
*NL*
uncommonly
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
are
dancing
with
the
only
handsome
girl
in
the
room
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
,
looking
at
the
eldest
Miss
Bennet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
She
is
the
most
beautiful
creature
I
ever
beheld
!
But
there
is
one
*NL*
of
her
sisters
sitting
down
just
behind
you
,
who
is
very
pretty
,
and
I
*NL*
dare
say
very
agreeable
.
Do
let
me
ask
my
partner
to
introduce
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
do
you
mean
?
''
and
turning
round
he
looked
for
a
moment
at
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
till
catching
her
eye
,
he
withdrew
his
own
and
coldly
said
:
*NL*
``
She
is
tolerable
,
but
not
handsome
enough
to
tempt
_
me
_
;
I
am
in
no
*NL*
humour
at
present
to
give
consequence
to
young
ladies
who
are
slighted
*NL*
by
other
men
.
You
had
better
return
to
your
partner
and
enjoy
her
*NL*
smiles
,
for
you
are
wasting
your
time
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bingley
followed
his
advice
.
Mr.
Darcy
walked
off
;
and
Elizabeth
*NL*
remained
with
no
very
cordial
feelings
toward
him
.
She
told
the
story
,
*NL*
however
,
with
great
spirit
among
her
friends
;
for
she
had
a
lively
,
*NL*
playful
disposition
,
which
delighted
in
anything
ridiculous
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
altogether
passed
off
pleasantly
to
the
whole
family
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
had
seen
her
eldest
daughter
much
admired
by
the
Netherfield
*NL*
party
.
Mr.
Bingley
had
danced
with
her
twice
,
and
she
had
been
*NL*
distinguished
by
his
sisters
.
Jane
was
as
much
gratified
by
this
as
*NL*
her
mother
could
be
,
though
in
a
quieter
way
.
Elizabeth
felt
Jane
's
*NL*
pleasure
.
Mary
had
heard
herself
mentioned
to
Miss
Bingley
as
the
most
*NL*
accomplished
girl
in
the
neighbourhood
;
and
Catherine
and
Lydia
had
been
*NL*
fortunate
enough
never
to
be
without
partners
,
which
was
all
that
they
*NL*
had
yet
learnt
to
care
for
at
a
ball
.
They
returned
,
therefore
,
in
good
*NL*
spirits
to
Longbourn
,
the
village
where
they
lived
,
and
of
which
they
*NL*
were
the
principal
inhabitants
.
They
found
Mr.
Bennet
still
up
.
With
*NL*
a
book
he
was
regardless
of
time
;
and
on
the
present
occasion
he
had
a
*NL*
good
deal
of
curiosity
as
to
the
event
of
an
evening
which
had
raised
*NL*
such
splendid
expectations
.
He
had
rather
hoped
that
his
wife
's
views
on
*NL*
the
stranger
would
be
disappointed
;
but
he
soon
found
out
that
he
had
a
*NL*
different
story
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
my
dear
Mr.
Bennet
,
''
as
she
entered
the
room
,
``
we
have
had
a
most
*NL*
delightful
evening
,
a
most
excellent
ball
.
I
wish
you
had
been
there
.
*NL*
Jane
was
so
admired
,
nothing
could
be
like
it
.
Everybody
said
how
well
*NL*
she
looked
;
and
Mr.
Bingley
thought
her
quite
beautiful
,
and
danced
with
*NL*
her
twice
!
Only
think
of
_
that
_
,
my
dear
;
he
actually
danced
with
her
*NL*
twice
!
and
she
was
the
only
creature
in
the
room
that
he
asked
a
second
*NL*
time
.
First
of
all
,
he
asked
Miss
Lucas
.
I
was
so
vexed
to
see
him
stand
*NL*
up
with
her
!
But
,
however
,
he
did
not
admire
her
at
all
;
indeed
,
nobody
*NL*
can
,
you
know
;
and
he
seemed
quite
struck
with
Jane
as
she
was
going
*NL*
down
the
dance
.
So
he
inquired
who
she
was
,
and
got
introduced
,
and
*NL*
asked
her
for
the
two
next
.
Then
the
two
third
he
danced
with
Miss
King
,
*NL*
and
the
two
fourth
with
Maria
Lucas
,
and
the
two
fifth
with
Jane
again
,
*NL*
and
the
two
sixth
with
Lizzy
,
and
the
_
Boulanger
_
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
had
had
any
compassion
for
_
me
_
,
''
cried
her
husband
impatiently
,
*NL*
``
he
would
not
have
danced
half
so
much
!
For
God
's
sake
,
say
no
more
of
*NL*
his
partners
.
Oh
that
he
had
sprained
his
ankle
in
the
first
dance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
my
dear
,
I
am
quite
delighted
with
him
.
He
is
so
excessively
*NL*
handsome
!
And
his
sisters
are
charming
women
.
I
never
in
my
life
saw
*NL*
anything
more
elegant
than
their
dresses
.
I
dare
say
the
lace
upon
Mrs.
*NL*
Hurst
's
gown
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
was
interrupted
again
.
Mr.
Bennet
protested
against
any
*NL*
description
of
finery
.
She
was
therefore
obliged
to
seek
another
branch
*NL*
of
the
subject
,
and
related
,
with
much
bitterness
of
spirit
and
some
*NL*
exaggeration
,
the
shocking
rudeness
of
Mr.
Darcy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
can
assure
you
,
''
she
added
,
``
that
Lizzy
does
not
lose
much
by
not
*NL*
suiting
_
his
_
fancy
;
for
he
is
a
most
disagreeable
,
horrid
man
,
not
at
*NL*
all
worth
pleasing
.
So
high
and
so
conceited
that
there
was
no
enduring
*NL*
him
!
He
walked
here
,
and
he
walked
there
,
fancying
himself
so
very
*NL*
great
!
Not
handsome
enough
to
dance
with
!
I
wish
you
had
been
there
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
to
have
given
him
one
of
your
set-downs
.
I
quite
detest
the
man

When
Jane
and
Elizabeth
were
alone
,
the
former
,
who
had
been
cautious
in
*NL*
her
praise
of
Mr.
Bingley
before
,
expressed
to
her
sister
just
how
very
*NL*
much
she
admired
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
just
what
a
young

said
she
,
``
sensible

good-humoured

so
much

ease

with
such
perfect
good
breeding

*NL*

``
He

replied
Elizabeth

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
very
much
flattered
by
his
asking

to
dance
a
second
time

I
*NL*
did
not
expect
such
a
compliment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
not
you
?
I
did
for
you

But
that

one
great

Compliments
always
take
_
you
_
by
surprise

never

What
*NL*
could
be
more
natural
than
his
asking

*NL*
seeing
that

about
five
times
as
pretty

in

No

that

Well

he
certainly
is

very
agreeable

give

good
sense
,
to
be
so
honestly
blind
to
the
follies

nonsense
of

Affectation
of
candour
is
common
enough

one
meets

to
take

make

mistaken

*NL*
Elizabeth
listened
in
silence
,
but
was
not
convinced
;
their
behaviour
at
*NL*
the
assembly
had
not
been
calculated
to
please
in
general
;

with
more

quickness
of
observation

less
pliancy
of
temper
than
her
sister
,
*NL*
and
with
a
judgement
too
unassailed
by
any
attention
to
herself
,
she
*NL*
was
very
little
disposed
to
approve
them

They
were
in
fact
very
fine
*NL*
ladies
;
not
deficient
in
good
humour
when
they
were
pleased
,
nor
in
the
*NL*
power
of
making
themselves
agreeable
when
they
chose
it
,
but
proud
and
*NL*
conceited
.
They
were
rather
handsome
,
had
been
educated
in
one
of
the
*NL*
first
private
seminaries
in
town
,
had
a
fortune
of
twenty
thousand
*NL*
pounds
,
were
in
the
habit
of
spending
more
than
they
ought
,
and
of
*NL*
associating
with
people
of
rank
,
and
were
therefore
in
every
respect
*NL*
entitled
to
think
well
of
themselves
,
and
meanly
of
others
.
They
were
of
*NL*
a
respectable
family
in
the
north
of
England
;
a
circumstance
more
deeply
*NL*
impressed
on
their
memories
than
that
their
brother
's
fortune
and
their
*NL*
own
had
been
acquired
by
trade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bingley
inherited
property
to
the
amount
of
nearly
a
hundred
*NL*
thousand
pounds
from
his
father
,
who
had
intended
to
purchase
an
*NL*
estate
,
but
did
not
live
to
do
it
.
Mr.
Bingley
intended
it
likewise
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
made
choice
of
his
county
;
but
as
he
was
now
provided
with
a
*NL*
good
house
and
the
liberty
of
a
manor
,
it
was
doubtful
to
many
of
those
*NL*
who
best
knew
the
easiness
of
his
temper
,
whether
he
might
not
spend
the
*NL*
remainder
of
his
days
at
Netherfield
,
and
leave
the
next
generation
to
*NL*
purchase
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
sisters
were
anxious
for
his
having
an
estate
of
his
own
;
but
,
*NL*
though
he
was
now
only
established
as
a
tenant
,
Miss
Bingley
was
by
no
*NL*
means
unwilling
to
preside
at
his
table
--
nor
was
Mrs.
Hurst
,
who
had
*NL*
married
a
man
of
more
fashion
than
fortune
,
less
disposed
to
consider
*NL*
his
house
as
her
home
when
it
suited
her
.
Mr.
Bingley
had
not
been
of
*NL*
age
two
years
,
when
he
was
tempted
by
an
accidental
recommendation
*NL*
to
look
at
Netherfield
House
.
He
did
look
at
it
,
and
into
it
for
*NL*
half-an-hour
--
was
pleased
with
the
situation
and
the
principal
*NL*
rooms
,
satisfied
with
what
the
owner
said
in
its
praise
,
and
took
it
*NL*
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
him
and
Darcy
there
was
a
very
steady
friendship
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
great
opposition
of
character
.
Bingley
was
endeared
to
Darcy
by
the
*NL*
easiness
,
openness
,
and
ductility
of
his
temper
,
though
no
disposition
*NL*
could
offer
a
greater
contrast
to
his
own
,
and
though
with
his
own
he
*NL*
never
appeared
dissatisfied
.
On
the
strength
of
Darcy
's
regard
,
Bingley
*NL*
had
the
firmest
reliance
,
and
of
his
judgement
the
highest
opinion
.
*NL*
In
understanding
,
Darcy
was
the
superior
.
Bingley
was
by
no
means
*NL*
deficient
,
but
Darcy
was
clever
.
He
was
at
the
same
time
haughty
,
*NL*
reserved
,
and
fastidious
,
and
his
manners
,
though
well-bred
,
were
not
*NL*
inviting
.
In
that
respect
his
friend
had
greatly
the
advantage
.
Bingley
*NL*
was
sure
of
being
liked
wherever
he
appeared
,
Darcy
was
continually
*NL*
giving
offense
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manner
in
which
they
spoke
of
the
Meryton
assembly
was
sufficiently
*NL*
characteristic
.
Bingley
had
never
met
with
more
pleasant
people
or
*NL*
prettier
girls
in
his
life
;
everybody
had
been
most
kind
and
attentive
*NL*
to
him
;
there
had
been
no
formality
,
no
stiffness
;
he
had
soon
felt
*NL*
acquainted
with
all
the
room
;
and
,
as
to
Miss
Bennet
,
he
could
not
*NL*
conceive
an
angel
more
beautiful
.
Darcy
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
seen
a
*NL*
collection
of
people
in
whom
there
was
little
beauty
and
no
fashion
,
for
*NL*
none
of
whom
he
had
felt
the
smallest
interest
,
and
from
none
received
*NL*
either
attention
or
pleasure
.
Miss
Bennet
he
acknowledged
to
be
pretty
,
*NL*
but
she
smiled
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurst
and
her
sister
allowed
it
to
be
so
--
but
still
they
admired
*NL*
her
and
liked
her
,
and
pronounced
her
to
be
a
sweet
girl
,
and
one
*NL*
whom
they
would
not
object
to
know
more
of
.
Miss
Bennet
was
therefore
*NL*
established
as
a
sweet
girl
,
and
their
brother
felt
authorized
by
such
*NL*
commendation
to
think
of
her
as
he
chose
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Within
a
short
walk
of
Longbourn
lived
a
family
with
whom
the
Bennets
*NL*
were
particularly
intimate
.
Sir
William
Lucas
had
been
formerly
in
trade
*NL*
in
Meryton
,
where
he
had
made
a
tolerable
fortune
,
and
risen
to
the
*NL*
honour
of
knighthood
by
an
address
to
the
king
during
his
mayoralty
.
*NL*
The
distinction
had
perhaps
been
felt
too
strongly
.
It
had
given
him
a
*NL*
disgust
to
his
business
,
and
to
his
residence
in
a
small
market
town
;
*NL*
and
,
in
quitting
them
both
,
he
had
removed
with
his
family
to
a
house
*NL*
about
a
mile
from
Meryton
,
denominated
from
that
period
Lucas
Lodge
,
*NL*
where
he
could
think
with
pleasure
of
his
own
importance
,
and
,
*NL*
unshackled
by
business
,
occupy
himself
solely
in
being
civil
to
all
*NL*
the
world
.
For
,
though
elated
by
his
rank
,
it
did
not
render
him
*NL*
supercilious
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
was
all
attention
to
everybody
.
By
*NL*
nature
inoffensive
,
friendly
,
and
obliging
,
his
presentation
at
St.
*NL*
James
's
had
made
him
courteous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Lucas
was
a
very
good
kind
of
woman
,
not
too
clever
to
be
a
*NL*
valuable
neighbour
to
Mrs.
Bennet
.
They
had
several
children
.
The
eldest
*NL*
of
them
,
a
sensible
,
intelligent
young
woman
,
about
twenty-seven
,
was
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
intimate
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
Miss
Lucases
and
the
Miss
Bennets
should
meet
to
talk
over
*NL*
a
ball
was
absolutely
necessary
;
and
the
morning
after
the
assembly
*NL*
brought
the
former
to
Longbourn
to
hear
and
to
communicate
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
began
the
evening
well
,
Charlotte
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bennet
with
civil
*NL*
self-command
to
Miss
Lucas
.
''
_
You
_
were
Mr.
Bingley
's
first
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
he
seemed
to
like
his
second
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
you
mean
Jane
,
I
suppose
,
because
he
danced
with
her
twice
.
To
be
*NL*
sure
that
_
did
_
seem
as
if
he
admired
her
--
indeed
I
rather
believe
he
*NL*
_
did
_
--
I
heard
something
about
it
--
but
I
hardly
know
what
--
something
*NL*
about
Mr.
Robinson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
mean
what
I
overheard
between
him
and
Mr.
Robinson
;
did
not
*NL*
I
mention
it
to
you
?
Mr.
Robinson
's
asking
him
how
he
liked
our
Meryton
*NL*
assemblies
,
and
whether
he
did
not
think
there
were
a
great
many
*NL*
pretty
women
in
the
room
,
and
_
which
_
he
thought
the
prettiest
?
and
his
*NL*
answering
immediately
to
the
last
question
:
`
Oh
!
the
eldest
Miss
Bennet
,
*NL*
beyond
a
doubt
;
there
can
not
be
two
opinions
on
that
point
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
!
Well
,
that
is
very
decided
indeed
--
that
does
seem
as
*NL*
if
--
but
,
however
,
it
may
all
come
to
nothing
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
My
_
overhearings
were
more
to
the
purpose
than
_
yours
_
,
Eliza
,
''
said
*NL*
Charlotte
.
``
Mr.
Darcy
is
not
so
well
worth
listening
to
as
his
friend

*NL*
is
he
?
--
poor
Eliza

to
be
only
just
_
tolerable

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
would
not
put
it
into
Lizzy
's
head
to
be
vexed
by
his
*NL*
ill-treatment
,
for
he
is
such
a
disagreeable
man
,
that
it
would
be
quite
*NL*
a
misfortune
to
be
liked
by
him
.
Mrs.
Long
told
me
last
night
that
he
*NL*
sat
close
to
her
for
half-an-hour
without
once
opening
his
lips
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
sure
,
ma'am
?

is
not
there
a
little
mistake

said
Jane

*NL*
``
I
certainly
saw
Mr.
Darcy
speaking
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

because
she
asked
him
at
last
how
he
liked
Netherfield
,
and
he
*NL*
could
not
help
answering
her
;
but
she
said
he
seemed
quite
angry
at
*NL*
being
spoke
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Bingley
told
me
,
''
said
Jane
,
``
that
he
never
speaks
much
,
*NL*
unless
among
his
intimate
acquaintances
.
With
_
them
_
he
is
remarkably
*NL*
agreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it

my
dear

If
he
had
been
so
very
*NL*
agreeable
,
he
would
have
talked
to
Mrs.
Long
.
But
I
can
guess
how
it
*NL*
was
;
everybody
says
that
he
is
eat
up
with
pride
,
and
I
dare
say
he
had
*NL*
heard
somehow
that
Mrs.
Long
does
not
keep
a
carriage
,
and
had
come
to
*NL*
the
ball
in
a
hack
chaise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
mind
his
not
talking
to
Mrs.

said
Miss
Lucas
,
``
but
I
*NL*
wish
he
had
danced
with
Eliza

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
time

Lizzy

''
said
her
mother
,
``
I
would
not
dance

him

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe

I
may
safely
promise
you

*NL*
``
His
pride

''
said
Miss
Lucas
,
``
does
not
offend
_
me

so
much
as
pride
*NL*
often
does

there
is
an
excuse

One
can
not

so
*NL*
very
fine
a
young
man
,
with
family
,
fortune

everything
in

If
I

to
be
proud

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
true

Elizabeth

I

forgive

his

pride

if
he
had
not
mortified
_
mine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pride
,
''
observed
Mary
,
who
piqued
herself
upon
the
solidity
of
her
*NL*
reflections
,
``
is
a
very
common
failing
,
I
believe
.
By
all
that
I
have
*NL*
ever
read
,
I
am
convinced
that
it
is
very
common
indeed
;
that
human
*NL*
nature
is
particularly
prone
to
it
,
and
that
there
are
very
few
of
us
*NL*
who
do
not
cherish
a
feeling
of
self-complacency
on
the
score
of
some
*NL*
quality
or
other
,
real
or
imaginary
.
Vanity
and
pride
are
different
*NL*
things
,
though
the
words
are
often
used
synonymously
.
A
person
may
*NL*
be
proud
without
being
vain
.
Pride
relates
more
to
our
opinion
of
*NL*
ourselves
,
vanity
to
what
we
would
have
others
think
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
as
rich
as
Mr.
Darcy

''
cried
a
young
Lucas
,
who
came
with
*NL*
his
sisters
,
``
I
should
not
care
how
proud
I
was

I
would
keep
a
pack
of
*NL*
foxhounds
,

drink
a
bottle
of
wine
a
day

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
would
drink
a
great
deal
more

Mrs.

Bennet
;
``
and
if

were

I
should
take
away
your
bottle

directly

The
boy
protested
that
she
should
not
;
she
continued
to
declare
that
she
*NL*
would

the
argument
ended
only
with
the
visit

*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
of
Longbourn
soon
waited
on
those
of
Netherfield
.
The
visit
*NL*
was
soon
returned
in
due
form
.
Miss
Bennet
's
pleasing
manners
grew
on
*NL*
the
goodwill
of
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
;
and
though
the
mother
was
*NL*
found
to
be
intolerable
,
and
the
younger
sisters
not
worth
speaking
to
,
*NL*
a
wish
of
being
better
acquainted
with
_
them
_
was
expressed
towards
*NL*
the
two
eldest
.
By
Jane
,
this
attention
was
received
with
the
greatest
*NL*
pleasure
,
but
Elizabeth
still
saw
superciliousness
in
their
treatment
*NL*
of
everybody
,
hardly
excepting
even
her
sister
,
and
could
not
like
them
;
*NL*
though
their
kindness
to
Jane
,
such
as
it
was
,
had
a
value
as
arising
in
*NL*
all
probability
from
the
influence
of
their
brother
's
admiration
.
It
*NL*
was
generally
evident
whenever
they
met
,
that
he
_
did
_
admire
her
and
*NL*
to
_
her
_
it
was
equally
evident
that
Jane
was
yielding
to
the
preference
*NL*
which
she
had
begun
to
entertain
for
him
from
the
first
,
and
was
in
a
*NL*
way
to
be
very
much
in
love
;
but
she
considered
with
pleasure
that
it
*NL*
was
not
likely
to
be
discovered
by
the
world
in
general
,
since
Jane
*NL*
united
,
with
great
strength
of
feeling
,
a
composure
of
temper
and
a
*NL*
uniform
cheerfulness
of
manner
which
would
guard
her
from
the
suspicions
*NL*
of
the
impertinent
.
She
mentioned
this
to
her
friend
Miss
Lucas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
perhaps
be
pleasant
,
''
replied
Charlotte
,
``
to
be
able
to
impose
*NL*
on
the
public
in
such
a
case
;
but
it
is
sometimes
a
disadvantage
to
be
*NL*
so
very
guarded
.
If
a
woman
conceals
her
affection
with
the
same
skill
*NL*
from
the
object
of
it
,
she
may
lose
the
opportunity
of
fixing
him
;
and
*NL*
it
will
then
be
but
poor
consolation
to
believe
the
world
equally
in
*NL*
the
dark
.
There
is
so
much
of
gratitude
or
vanity
in
almost
every
*NL*
attachment
,
that
it
is
not
safe
to
leave
any
to
itself
.
We
can
all
*NL*
_
begin
_
freely
--
a
slight
preference
is
natural
enough
;
but
there
are
*NL*
very
few
of
us
who
have
heart
enough
to
be
really
in
love
without
*NL*
encouragement
.
In
nine
cases
out
of
ten
a
women
had
better
show
_
more
_
*NL*
affection
than
she
feels
.
Bingley
likes
your
sister
undoubtedly
;
but
he
*NL*
may
never
do
more
than
like
her
,
if
she
does
not
help
him
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
does
help
him
on
,
as
much
as
her
nature
will
allow
.
If
I
can
*NL*
perceive
her
regard
for
him
,
he
must
be
a
simpleton
,
indeed
,
not
to
*NL*
discover
it
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
Eliza
,
that
he
does
not
know
Jane
's
disposition
as
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
a
woman
is
partial
to
a
man
,
and
does
not
endeavour
to
conceal
*NL*
it
,
he
must
find
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
must
,
if
he
sees
enough
of
her
.
But
,
though
Bingley
and
Jane
*NL*
meet
tolerably
often
,
it
is
never
for
many
hours
together
;
and
,
as
they
*NL*
always
see
each
other
in
large
mixed
parties
,
it
is
impossible
that
*NL*
every
moment
should
be
employed
in
conversing
together
.
Jane
should
*NL*
therefore
make
the
most
of
every
half-hour
in
which
she
can
command
his
*NL*
attention
.
When
she
is
secure
of
him
,
there
will
be
more
leisure
for
*NL*
falling
in
love
as
much
as
she
chooses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
plan
is
a
good
one
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
,
``
where
nothing
is
in
*NL*
question
but
the
desire
of
being
well
married
,
and
if
I
were
determined
*NL*
to
get
a
rich
husband
,
or
any
husband
,
I
dare
say
I
should
adopt
it
.
But
*NL*
these
are
not
Jane
's
feelings
;
she
is
not
acting
by
design
.
As
yet
,
*NL*
she
can
not
even
be
certain
of
the
degree
of
her
own
regard
nor
of
its
*NL*
reasonableness
.
She
has
known
him
only
a
fortnight
.
She
danced
four
*NL*
dances
with
him
at
Meryton
;
she
saw
him
one
morning
at
his
own
house
,
*NL*
and
has
since
dined
with
him
in
company
four
times
.
This
is
not
quite
*NL*
enough
to
make
her
understand
his
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
as
you
represent
it
.
Had
she
merely
_
dined
_
with
him
,
she
might
*NL*
only
have
discovered
whether
he
had
a
good
appetite
;
but
you
must
*NL*
remember
that
four
evenings
have
also
been
spent
together
--
and
four
*NL*
evenings
may
do
a
great
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
these
four
evenings
have
enabled
them
to
ascertain
that
they
*NL*
both
like
Vingt-un
better
than
Commerce
;
but
with
respect
to
any
other
*NL*
leading
characteristic
,
I
do
not
imagine
that
much
has
been
unfolded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Charlotte
,
``
I
wish
Jane
success
with
all
my
heart
;
and
*NL*
if
she
were
married
to
him
to-morrow
,
I
should
think
she
had
as
good
a
*NL*
chance
of
happiness
as
if
she
were
to
be
studying
his
character
for
a
*NL*
twelvemonth
.
Happiness
in
marriage
is
entirely
a
matter
of
chance
.
If
*NL*
the
dispositions
of
the
parties
are
ever
so
well
known
to
each
other
or
*NL*
ever
so
similar
beforehand
,
it
does
not
advance
their
felicity
in
the
*NL*
least
.
They
always
continue
to
grow
sufficiently
unlike
afterwards
to
*NL*
have
their
share
of
vexation
;
and
it
is
better
to
know
as
little
as
*NL*
possible
of
the
defects
of
the
person
with
whom
you
are
to
pass
your
*NL*
life

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
make
me
laugh
,
Charlotte
;

it
is
not
sound

You
know
it
is
not
*NL*
sound
,
and
that
you
would
never
act
in
this
way
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Occupied
in
observing
Mr.
Bingley
's
attentions
to
her
sister
,
Elizabeth
*NL*
was
far
from
suspecting
that
she
was
herself
becoming
an
object
of
some
*NL*
interest
in
the
eyes
of
his
friend
.
Mr.
Darcy
had
at
first
scarcely
*NL*
allowed
her
to
be
pretty
;
he
had
looked
at
her
without
admiration
at
the
*NL*
ball
;
and
when
they
next
met
,
he
looked
at
her
only
to
criticise
.
But
no
*NL*
sooner
had
he
made
it
clear
to
himself
and
his
friends
that
she
hardly
*NL*
had
a
good
feature
in
her
face
,
than
he
began
to
find
it
was
rendered
*NL*
uncommonly
intelligent
by
the
beautiful
expression
of
her
dark
eyes
.
To
*NL*
this
discovery
succeeded
some
others
equally
mortifying
.
Though
he
had
*NL*
detected
with
a
critical
eye
more
than
one
failure
of
perfect
symmetry
*NL*
in
her
form
,
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
her
figure
to
be
light
and
*NL*
pleasing
;
and
in
spite
of
his
asserting
that
her
manners
were
not
those
*NL*
of
the
fashionable
world
,
he
was
caught
by
their
easy
playfulness
.
Of
*NL*
this
she
was
perfectly
unaware
;
to
her
he
was
only
the
man
who
made
*NL*
himself
agreeable
nowhere
,
and
who
had
not
thought
her
handsome
enough
*NL*
to
dance
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
wish
to
know
more
of
her
,
and
as
a
step
towards
conversing
*NL*
with
her
himself
,
attended
to
her
conversation
with
others
.
His
doing
so
*NL*
drew
her
notice
.
It
was
at
Sir
William
Lucas
's
,
where
a
large
party
were
*NL*
assembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
Mr.
Darcy
mean
,
''
said
she
to
Charlotte
,
``
by
listening
to
my
*NL*
conversation
with
Colonel
Forster
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
question
which
Mr.
Darcy
only
can
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
he
does
it
any
more
I
shall
certainly
let
him
know
that
I
see
*NL*
what
he
is
about
.
He
has
a
very
satirical
eye
,
and
if
I
do
not
begin
by
*NL*
being
impertinent
myself
,
I
shall
soon
grow
afraid
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
approaching
them
soon
afterwards
,
though
without
seeming
to
have
*NL*
any
intention
of
speaking
,
Miss
Lucas
defied
her
friend
to
mention
such
*NL*
a
subject
to
him
;
which
immediately
provoking
Elizabeth
to
do
it
,
she
*NL*
turned
to
him
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
not
think
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
that
I
expressed
myself
uncommonly
*NL*
well
just
now
,
when
I
was
teasing
Colonel
Forster
to
give
us
a
ball
at
*NL*
Meryton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
great
energy
;
but
it
is
always
a
subject
which
makes
a
lady
*NL*
energetic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
severe
on
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
_
her
_
turn
soon
to
be
teased
,
''
said
Miss
Lucas
.
``
I
am
going
*NL*
to
open
the
instrument
,
Eliza
,
and
you
know
what
follows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
very
strange
creature
by
way
of
a
friend
!
--
always
wanting
me
*NL*
to
play
and
sing
before
anybody
and
everybody
!
If
my
vanity
had
taken
*NL*
a
musical
turn
,
you
would
have
been
invaluable
;
but
as
it
is
,
I
would
*NL*
really
rather
not
sit
down
before
those
who
must
be
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
hearing
the
very
best
performers
.
''
On
Miss
Lucas
's
persevering
,
however
,
*NL*
she
added
,
``
Very
well
,
if
it
must
be
so
,
it
must
.
''
And
gravely
glancing
*NL*
at
Mr.
Darcy
,
``
There
is
a
fine
old
saying
,
which
everybody
here
is
of
*NL*
course
familiar
with
:
`
Keep
your
breath
to
cool
your
porridge
'
;
and
I
*NL*
shall
keep
mine
to
swell
my
song
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
performance
was
pleasing
,
though
by
no
means
capital
.
After
a
song
*NL*
or
two
,
and
before
she
could
reply
to
the
entreaties
of
several
that
*NL*
she
would
sing
again
,
she
was
eagerly
succeeded
at
the
instrument
by
her
*NL*
sister
Mary
,
who
having
,
in
consequence
of
being
the
only
plain
one
in
*NL*
the
family
,
worked
hard
for
knowledge
and
accomplishments
,
was
always
*NL*
impatient
for
display
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
neither
genius
nor
taste
;
and
though
vanity
had
given
her
*NL*
application
,
it
had
given
her
likewise
a
pedantic
air
and
conceited
*NL*
manner
,
which
would
have
injured
a
higher
degree
of
excellence
than
she
*NL*
had
reached
.
Elizabeth
,
easy
and
unaffected
,
had
been
listened
to
with
*NL*
much
more
pleasure
,
though
not
playing
half
so
well
;
and
Mary
,
at
the
*NL*
end
of
a
long
concerto
,
was
glad
to
purchase
praise
and
gratitude
by
*NL*
Scotch
and
Irish
airs
,
at
the
request
of
her
younger
sisters
,
who
,
*NL*
with
some
of
the
Lucases
,
and
two
or
three
officers
,
joined
eagerly
in
*NL*
dancing
at
one
end
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
stood
near
them
in
silent
indignation
at
such
a
mode
of
*NL*
passing
the
evening
,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
conversation
,
and
was
too
*NL*
much
engrossed
by
his
thoughts
to
perceive
that
Sir
William
Lucas
was
*NL*
his
neighbour
,
till
Sir
William
thus
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
charming
amusement
for
young
people
this
is
,
Mr.
Darcy
!
There
*NL*
is
nothing
like
dancing
after
all
.
I
consider
it
as
one
of
the
first
*NL*
refinements
of
polished
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
sir
;
and
it
has
the
advantage
also
of
being
in
vogue
amongst
*NL*
the
less
polished
societies
of
the
world
.
Every
savage
can
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
William
only
smiled
.
``
Your
friend
performs
delightfully
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
after
a
pause
,
on
seeing
Bingley
join
the
group
;
``
and
I
doubt
*NL*
not
that
you
are
an
adept
in
the
science
yourself
,
Mr.
Darcy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saw
me
dance
at
Meryton
,
I
believe
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
and
received
no
inconsiderable
pleasure
from
the
sight
.
Do
*NL*
you
often
dance
at
St.
James
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
think
it
would
be
a
proper
compliment
to
the
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
compliment
which
I
never
pay
to
any
place
if
I
can
avoid
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
house
in
town
,
I
conclude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
once
had
some
thought
of
fixing
in
town
myself
--
for
I
am
fond
*NL*
of
superior
society
;
but
I
did
not
feel
quite
certain
that
the
air
of
*NL*
London
would
agree
with
Lady
Lucas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
in
hopes
of
an
answer
;
but
his
companion
was
not
disposed
*NL*
to
make
any
;
and
Elizabeth
at
that
instant
moving
towards
them
,
he
was
*NL*
struck
with
the
action
of
doing
a
very
gallant
thing
,
and
called
out
to
*NL*
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Eliza
,
why
are
you
not
dancing
?
Mr.
Darcy
,
you
must
allow
*NL*
me
to
present
this
young
lady
to
you
as
a
very
desirable
partner
.
You
*NL*
can
not
refuse
to
dance
,
I
am
sure
when
so
much
beauty
is
before
you
.
''
*NL*
And
,
taking
her
hand
,
he
would
have
given
it
to
Mr.
Darcy
who
,
though
*NL*
extremely
surprised
,
was
not
unwilling
to
receive
it
,
when
she
instantly
*NL*
drew
back
,
and
said
with
some
discomposure
to
Sir
William
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
I
have
not
the
least
intention
of
dancing
.
I
entreat
you
*NL*
not
to
suppose
that
I
moved
this
way
in
order
to
beg
for
a
partner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
,
with
grave
propriety
,
requested
to
be
allowed
the
honour
of
*NL*
her
hand
,
but
in
vain
.
Elizabeth
was
determined
;
nor
did
Sir
William
at
*NL*
all
shake
her
purpose
by
his
attempt
at
persuasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
excel
so
much
in
the
dance
,
Miss
Eliza
,
that
it
is
cruel
to
deny
*NL*
me
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
;
and
though
this
gentleman
dislikes
the
*NL*
amusement
in
general
,
he
can
have
no
objection
,
I
am
sure
,
to
oblige
us
*NL*
for
one
half-hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Darcy
is
all
politeness

''
said
Elizabeth
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
,
indeed
;
but
,
considering
the
inducement
,
my
dear
Miss
Eliza
,
*NL*
we
can
not
wonder
at
his
complaisance
--
for
who
would
object
to
such
a
*NL*
partner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
looked
archly
,
and
turned
away
.
Her
resistance
had
not
*NL*
injured
her
with
the
gentleman
,
and
he
was
thinking
of
her
with
some
*NL*
complacency
,
when
thus
accosted
by
Miss
Bingley
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
guess
the
subject
of
your
reverie
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
imagine
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
considering
how
insupportable
it
would
be
to
pass
many
evenings
*NL*
in
this
manner
--
in
such
society
;
and
indeed
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
.
*NL*
I
was
never
more
annoyed
!
The
insipidity
,
and
yet
the
noise
--
the
*NL*
nothingness
,
and
yet
the
self-importance
of
all
those
people
!
What
would
*NL*
I
give
to
hear
your
strictures
on
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
conjecture
is
totally
wrong
,
I
assure
you
.
My
mind
was
more
*NL*
agreeably
engaged
.
I
have
been
meditating
on
the
very
great
pleasure
*NL*
which
a
pair
of
fine
eyes
in
the
face
of
a
pretty
woman
can
bestow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
immediately
fixed
her
eyes
on
his
face
,
and
desired
he
*NL*
would
tell
her
what
lady
had
the
credit
of
inspiring
such
reflections
.
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
replied
with
great
intrepidity
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Elizabeth
Bennet

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Elizabeth
Bennet

repeated
Miss
Bingley
.
``
I
am
all
astonishment

long
has
she
been
such
a
favourite

joy

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
exactly
the
question
which
I
expected
you
to
ask

A
lady

imagination

very
rapid
;
it
jumps
from
admiration
to
love

from
love
*NL*
to
matrimony

in
a
moment

I
knew
you

be
wishing

joy

*NL*
``
Nay

mother-in-law
,
indeed
;
*NL*
and
,
of
course
,
she
will
always
be
at
Pemberley
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
to
her
with
perfect
indifference
while
she
chose
to
*NL*
entertain
herself
in
this
manner
;
and
as
his
composure
convinced
her
*NL*
that
all
was
safe
,
her
wit
flowed
long
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
's
property
consisted
almost
entirely
in
an
estate
of
two
*NL*
thousand
a
year
,
which
,
unfortunately
for
his
daughters
,
was
entailed
,
*NL*
in
default
of
heirs
male
,
on
a
distant
relation
;
and
their
mother
's
*NL*
fortune
,
though
ample
for
her
situation
in
life
,
could
but
ill
supply
*NL*
the
deficiency
of
his
.
Her
father
had
been
an
attorney
in
Meryton
,
and
*NL*
had
left
her
four
thousand
pounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
sister
married
to
a
Mr.
Phillips
,
who
had
been
a
clerk
to
*NL*
their
father
and
succeeded
him
in
the
business
,
and
a
brother
settled
in
*NL*
London
in
a
respectable
line
of
trade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
village
of
Longbourn
was
only
one
mile
from
Meryton
;
a
most
*NL*
convenient
distance
for
the
young
ladies
,
who
were
usually
tempted
*NL*
thither
three
or
four
times
a
week
,
to
pay
their
duty
to
their
aunt
and
*NL*
to
a
milliner
's
shop
just
over
the
way
.
The
two
youngest
of
the
family
,
*NL*
Catherine
and
Lydia
,
were
particularly
frequent
in
these
attentions
;
*NL*
their
minds
were
more
vacant
than
their
sisters
'
,
and
when
nothing
*NL*
better
offered
,
a
walk
to
Meryton
was
necessary
to
amuse
their
morning
*NL*
hours
and
furnish
conversation
for
the
evening
;
and
however
bare
of
news
*NL*
the
country
in
general
might
be
,
they
always
contrived
to
learn
some
*NL*
from
their
aunt
.
At
present
,
indeed
,
they
were
well
supplied
both
with
*NL*
news
and
happiness
by
the
recent
arrival
of
a
militia
regiment
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
;
it
was
to
remain
the
whole
winter
,
and
Meryton
was
the
*NL*
headquarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
visits
to
Mrs.
Phillips
were
now
productive
of
the
most
*NL*
interesting
intelligence
.
Every
day
added
something
to
their
knowledge
*NL*
of
the
officers
'
names
and
connections
.
Their
lodgings
were
not
long
a
*NL*
secret
,
and
at
length
they
began
to
know
the
officers
themselves
.
Mr.
*NL*
Phillips
visited
them
all
,
and
this
opened
to
his
nieces
a
store
of
*NL*
felicity
unknown
before
.
They
could
talk
of
nothing
but
officers
;
and
*NL*
Mr.
Bingley
's
large
fortune
,
the
mention
of
which
gave
animation
*NL*
to
their
mother
,
was
worthless
in
their
eyes
when
opposed
to
the
*NL*
regimentals
of
an
ensign
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
listening
one
morning
to
their
effusions
on
this
subject
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bennet
coolly
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
all
that
I
can
collect
by
your
manner
of
talking
,
you
must
be
two
*NL*
of
the
silliest
girls
in
the
country
.
I
have
suspected
it
some
time
,
but
*NL*
I
am
now
convinced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
was
disconcerted
,
and
made
no
answer
;
but
Lydia
,
with
perfect
*NL*
indifference
,
continued
to
express
her
admiration
of
Captain
Carter
,
*NL*
and
her
hope
of
seeing
him
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
as
he
was
going
the
*NL*
next
morning
to
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
astonished
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bennet
,
``
that
you
should
be
so
*NL*
ready
to
think
your
own
children
silly
.
If
I
wished
to
think
slightingly
*NL*
of
anybody
's
children
,
it
should
not
be
of
my
own
,
however
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
my
children
are
silly
,
I
must
hope
to
be
always
sensible
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
but
as
it
happens
,
they
are
all
of
them
very
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
only
point
,
I
flatter
myself
,
on
which
we
do
not
agree
.
I
*NL*
had
hoped
that
our
sentiments
coincided
in
every
particular
,
but
I
must
*NL*
so
far
differ
from
you
as
to
think
our
two
youngest
daughters
uncommonly
*NL*
foolish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Mr.
Bennet
,
you
must
not
expect
such
girls
to
have
the
sense
of
*NL*
their
father
and
mother
.
When
they
get
to
our
age
,
I
dare
say
they
will
*NL*
not
think
about
officers
any
more
than
we
do
.
I
remember
the
time
when
*NL*
I
liked
a
red
coat
myself
very
well
--
and
,
indeed
,
so
I
do
still
at
my
*NL*
heart
;
and
if
a
smart
young
colonel
,
with
five
or
six
thousand
a
year
,
*NL*
should
want
one
of
my
girls
I
shall
not
say
nay
to
him
;
and
I
thought
*NL*
Colonel
Forster
looked
very
becoming
the
other
night
at
Sir
William
's
in
*NL*
his
regimentals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
''
cried
Lydia
,
``
my
aunt
says
that
Colonel
Forster
and
Captain
*NL*
Carter
do
not
go
so
often
to
Miss
Watson
's
as
they
did
when
they
first
*NL*
came
;
she
sees
them
now
very
often
standing
in
Clarke
's
library
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
was
prevented
replying
by
the
entrance
of
the
footman
with
*NL*
a
note
for
Miss
Bennet
;
it
came
from
Netherfield
,
and
the
servant
waited
*NL*
for
an
answer
.
Mrs.
Bennet
's
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
,
and
she
was
*NL*
eagerly
calling
out
,
while
her
daughter
read
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Jane
,
who
is
it
from
?
What
is
it
about

What
does
he

Well

*NL*
Jane

make
haste

tell
us
;
make
haste

my
love

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
from
Miss
Bingley
,
''
said
Jane
,
and
then
read
it
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
MY

*NL*
*NL*

said
Mrs.

,
``
that

Can

''
said
Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

my
dear

you
had
better
go
on
horseback
,
because
it
seems
likely
to

rain

then
you
must
stay
all
night

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
a
good
scheme

said
Elizabeth
,
``
if
you
were
sure
that

they
would
not
offer
to
send
her
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
but
the
gentlemen
will
have
Mr.
Bingley

chaise
to
go
to
Meryton
,
*NL*
and

Hursts
have
no
horses
to
theirs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
much
rather
go
in
the
coach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
,
your
father
can
not
spare
the
horses
,
I
am
sure
.
They
are
*NL*
wanted
in
the
farm
,
Mr.
Bennet
,
are
they
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
wanted
in
the
farm
much
oftener
than
I
can
get
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
have
got
them
to-day
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
my
mother
's
purpose
*NL*
will
be
answered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
at
last
extort
from
her
father
an
acknowledgment
that
the
horses
*NL*
were
engaged
.
Jane
was
therefore
obliged
to
go
on
horseback
,
and
her
*NL*
mother
attended
her
to
the
door
with
many
cheerful
prognostics
of
a
*NL*
bad
day
.
Her
hopes
were
answered
;
Jane
had
not
been
gone
long
before
*NL*
it
rained
hard
.
Her
sisters
were
uneasy
for
her
,
but
her
mother
was
*NL*
delighted
.
The
rain
continued
the
whole
evening
without
intermission
;
*NL*
Jane
certainly
could
not
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
a
lucky
idea
of
mine
,
indeed
!
''
said
Mrs.
Bennet
more
than
*NL*
once
,
as
if
the
credit
of
making
it
rain
were
all
her
own
.
Till
the
*NL*
next
morning
,
however
,
she
was
not
aware
of
all
the
felicity
of
her
*NL*
contrivance
.
Breakfast
was
scarcely
over
when
a
servant
from
Netherfield
*NL*
brought
the
following
note
for
Elizabeth
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
MY
DEAREST
LIZZY
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
find
myself
very
unwell
this
morning
,
which
,
I
suppose
,
is
to
be
*NL*
imputed
to
my
getting
wet
through
yesterday
.
My
kind
friends
will
not
*NL*
hear
of
my
returning
till
I
am
better
.
They
insist
also
on
my
seeing
Mr.
*NL*
Jones
--
therefore
do
not
be
alarmed
if
you
should
hear
of
his
having
been
*NL*
to
me
--
and
,
excepting
a
sore
throat
and
headache
,
there
is
not
much
the
*NL*
matter
with
me
.
--
Yours
,
etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mr.
Bennet
,
when
Elizabeth
had
read
the
note
*NL*
aloud
,
``
if
your
daughter
should
have
a
dangerous
fit
of
illness
--
if
she
*NL*
should
die
,
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
know
that
it
was
all
in
pursuit
of
*NL*
Mr.
Bingley
,
and
under
your
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
am
not
afraid
of
her
dying
.
People
do
not
die
of
little
trifling
*NL*
colds

She
will
be
taken
good
care
of
.
As
long
as
she
stays
there
,
it
is
*NL*
all
very
well
.
I
would
go
and
see
her
if
I
could
have
the
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
feeling
really
anxious
,
was
determined
to
go
to
her
,
though
*NL*
the
carriage
was
not
to
be
had
;
and
as
she
was
no
horsewoman
,
walking
*NL*
was
her
only
alternative
.
She
declared
her
resolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
be
so
silly
,
''
cried
her
mother
,
``
as
to
think
of
such
a
*NL*
thing
,
in
all
this
dirt
!
You
will
not
be
fit
to
be
seen
when
you
get
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
very
fit
to
see
Jane
--
which
is
all
I
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
a
hint
to
me
,
Lizzy
,
''
said
her
father
,
``
to
send
for
the
*NL*
horses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
I
do
not
wish
to
avoid
the
walk
.
The
distance
is
nothing
*NL*
when
one
has
a
motive
;
only
three
miles
.
I
shall
be
back
by
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
admire
the
activity
of
your
benevolence
,
''
observed
Mary
,
``
but
every
*NL*
impulse
of
feeling
should
be
guided
by
reason
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
*NL*
exertion
should
always
be
in
proportion
to
what
is
required
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
go
as
far
as
Meryton
with
you
,
''
said
Catherine
and
Lydia
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
accepted
their
company
,
and
the
three
young
ladies
set
off
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
make
haste
,
''
said
Lydia
,
as
they
walked
along
,
``
perhaps
we
may
*NL*
see
something
of
Captain
Carter
before
he
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
Meryton
they
parted
;
the
two
youngest
repaired
to
the
lodgings
of
one
*NL*
of
the
officers
'
wives
,
and
Elizabeth
continued
her
walk
alone
,
crossing
*NL*
field
after
field
at
a
quick
pace
,
jumping
over
stiles
and
springing
*NL*
over
puddles
with
impatient
activity
,
and
finding
herself
at
last
*NL*
within
view
of
the
house
,
with
weary
ankles
,
dirty
stockings
,
and
a
face
*NL*
glowing
with
the
warmth
of
exercise
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
shown
into
the
breakfast-parlour
,
where
all
but
Jane
were
*NL*
assembled
,
and
where
her
appearance
created
a
great
deal
of
surprise
.
*NL*
That
she
should
have
walked
three
miles
so
early
in
the
day
,
in
such
*NL*
dirty
weather
,
and
by
herself
,
was
almost
incredible
to
Mrs.
Hurst
and
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
;
and
Elizabeth
was
convinced
that
they
held
her
in
contempt
*NL*
for
it
.
She
was
received
,
however
,
very
politely
by
them
;
and
in
their
*NL*
brother
's
manners
there
was
something
better
than
politeness
;
there
*NL*
was
good
humour
and
kindness
.
Mr.
Darcy
said
very
little
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Hurst
nothing
at
all
.
The
former
was
divided
between
admiration
of
the
*NL*
brilliancy
which
exercise
had
given
to
her
complexion
,
and
doubt
as
*NL*
to
the
occasion
's
justifying
her
coming
so
far
alone
.
The
latter
was
*NL*
thinking
only
of
his
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
inquiries
after
her
sister
were
not
very
favourably
answered
.
Miss
*NL*
Bennet
had
slept
ill
,
and
though
up
,
was
very
feverish
,
and
not
*NL*
well
enough
to
leave
her
room
.
Elizabeth
was
glad
to
be
taken
to
her
*NL*
immediately
;
and
Jane
,
who
had
only
been
withheld
by
the
fear
of
giving
*NL*
alarm
or
inconvenience
from
expressing
in
her
note
how
much
she
longed
*NL*
for
such
a
visit
,
was
delighted
at
her
entrance
.
She
was
not
equal
,
*NL*
however
,
to
much
conversation
,
and
when
Miss
Bingley
left
them
*NL*
together
,
could
attempt
little
besides
expressions
of
gratitude
for
the
*NL*
extraordinary
kindness
she
was
treated
with
.
Elizabeth
silently
attended
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
breakfast
was
over
they
were
joined
by
the
sisters
;
and
Elizabeth
*NL*
began
to
like
them
herself
,
when
she
saw
how
much
affection
and
*NL*
solicitude
they
showed
for
Jane
.
The
apothecary
came
,
and
having
*NL*
examined
his
patient
,
said
,
as
might
be
supposed
,
that
she
had
caught
*NL*
a
violent
cold
,
and
that
they
must
endeavour
to
get
the
better
of
it
;
*NL*
advised
her
to
return
to
bed
,
and
promised
her
some
draughts
.
The
advice
*NL*
was
followed
readily
,
for
the
feverish
symptoms
increased
,
and
her
head
*NL*
ached
acutely
.
Elizabeth
did
not
quit
her
room
for
a
moment
;
nor
were
*NL*
the
other
ladies
often
absent
;
the
gentlemen
being
out
,
they
had
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
nothing
to
do
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
clock
struck
three
,
Elizabeth
felt
that
she
must
go
,
and
very
*NL*
unwillingly
said
so
.
Miss
Bingley
offered
her
the
carriage
,
and
she
only
*NL*
wanted
a
little
pressing
to
accept
it
,
when
Jane
testified
such
concern
*NL*
in
parting
with
her
,
that
Miss
Bingley
was
obliged
to
convert
the
offer
*NL*
of
the
chaise
to
an
invitation
to
remain
at
Netherfield
for
the
present
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
most
thankfully
consented
,
and
a
servant
was
dispatched
to
*NL*
Longbourn
to
acquaint
the
family
with
her
stay
and
bring
back
a
supply
*NL*
of
clothes
.

Chapter
8
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
five
o'clock
the
two
ladies
retired
to
dress
,
and
at
half-past
six
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
summoned
to
dinner
.
To
the
civil
inquiries
which
then
*NL*
poured
in
,
and
amongst
which
she
had
the
pleasure
of
distinguishing
the
*NL*
much
superior
solicitude
of
Mr.
Bingley
's
,
she
could
not
make
a
very
*NL*
favourable
answer
.
Jane
was
by
no
means
better
.
The
sisters
,
on
hearing
*NL*
this
,
repeated
three
or
four
times
how
much
they
were
grieved
,
how
*NL*
shocking
it
was
to
have
a
bad
cold
,
and
how
excessively
they
disliked
*NL*
being
ill
themselves
;
and
then
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
:
and
their
*NL*
indifference
towards
Jane
when
not
immediately
before
them
restored
*NL*
Elizabeth
to
the
enjoyment
of
all
her
former
dislike
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
brother
,
indeed
,
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
whom
she
could
*NL*
regard
with
any
complacency
.
His
anxiety
for
Jane
was
evident
,
and
his
*NL*
attentions
to
herself
most
pleasing
,
and
they
prevented
her
feeling
*NL*
herself
so
much
an
intruder
as
she
believed
she
was
considered
by
the
*NL*
others
.
She
had
very
little
notice
from
any
but
him
.
Miss
Bingley
was
*NL*
engrossed
by
Mr.
Darcy
,
her
sister
scarcely
less
so
;
and
as
for
Mr.
*NL*
Hurst
,
by
whom
Elizabeth
sat
,
he
was
an
indolent
man
,
who
lived
only
to
*NL*
eat
,
drink
,
and
play
at
cards
;
who
,
when
he
found
her
to
prefer
a
plain
*NL*
dish
to
a
ragout
,
had
nothing
to
say
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
dinner
was
over
,
she
returned
directly
to
Jane
,
and
Miss
Bingley
*NL*
began
abusing
her
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
the
room
.
Her
manners
were
*NL*
pronounced
to
be
very
bad
indeed
,
a
mixture
of
pride
and
impertinence
;
*NL*
she
had
no
conversation
,
no
style
,
no
beauty
.
Mrs.
Hurst
thought
the
*NL*
same
,
and
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
nothing
,
in
short
,
to
recommend
her
,
but
being
an
excellent
*NL*
walker
.
I
shall
never
forget
her
appearance
this
morning
.
She
really
*NL*
looked
almost
wild
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
,
indeed
,
Louisa
.
I
could
hardly
keep
my
countenance
.
Very
*NL*
nonsensical
to
come
at
all
!
Why
must
_
she
_
be
scampering
about
the
*NL*
country
,
because
her
sister
had
a
cold
?
Her
hair
,
so
untidy
,
so
blowsy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
her
petticoat
;
I
hope
you
saw
her
petticoat
,
six
inches
deep
*NL*
in
mud
,
I
am
absolutely
certain
;
and
the
gown
which
had
been
let
down
to
*NL*
hide
it
not
doing
its
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
picture
may
be
very
exact
,
Louisa
,
''
said
Bingley
;
``
but
this
was
*NL*
all
lost
upon
me
.
I
thought
Miss
Elizabeth
Bennet
looked
remarkably
*NL*
well
when
she
came
into
the
room
this
morning
.
Her
dirty
petticoat
quite
*NL*
escaped
my
notice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
observed
it
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
Miss
Bingley
;
``
and
I
am
*NL*
inclined
to
think
that
you
would
not
wish
to
see
_
your
_
sister
make
such
*NL*
an
exhibition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
walk
three
miles
,
or
four
miles
,
or
five
miles
,
or
whatever
it
is
,
*NL*
above
her
ankles
in
dirt
,
and
alone
,
quite
alone
!
What
could
she
mean
by
*NL*
it
?
It
seems
to
me
to
show
an
abominable
sort
of
conceited
independence
,
*NL*
a
most
country-town
indifference
to
decorum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shows
an
affection
for
her
sister
that
is
very
pleasing
,
''
said
*NL*
Bingley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
''
observed
Miss
Bingley
in
a
half
whisper
,
``
that
*NL*
this
adventure
has
rather
affected
your
admiration
of
her
fine
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
he
replied
;
``
they
were
brightened
by
the
exercise
.
''
A
*NL*
short
pause
followed
this
speech
,
and
Mrs.
Hurst
began
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
an
excessive
regard
for
Miss
Jane
Bennet
,
she
is
really
a
very
*NL*
sweet
girl
,
and
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
she
were
well
settled
.
But
with
*NL*
such
a
father
and
mother
,
and
such
low
connections
,
I
am
afraid
there
is
*NL*
no
chance
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
have
heard
you
say
that
their
uncle
is
an
attorney
in
*NL*
Meryton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
they
have
another
,
who
lives
somewhere
near
Cheapside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
capital
,
''
added
her
sister
,
and
they
both
laughed
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
had
uncles
enough
to
fill
_
all
_
Cheapside
,
''
cried
Bingley
,
``
it
*NL*
would
not
make
them
one
jot
less
agreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
must
very
materially
lessen
their
chance
of
marrying
men
of
any
*NL*
consideration
in
the
world
,
''
replied
Darcy
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
speech
Bingley
made
no
answer
;
but
his
sisters
gave
it
their
*NL*
hearty
assent
,
and
indulged
their
mirth
for
some
time
at
the
expense
of
*NL*
their
dear
friend
's
vulgar
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
renewal
of
tenderness
,
however
,
they
returned
to
her
room
on
*NL*
leaving
the
dining-parlour
,
and
sat
with
her
till
summoned
to
coffee
.
*NL*
She
was
still
very
poorly
,
and
Elizabeth
would
not
quit
her
at
all
,
till
*NL*
late
in
the
evening
,
when
she
had
the
comfort
of
seeing
her
sleep
,
and
*NL*
when
it
seemed
to
her
rather
right
than
pleasant
that
she
should
go
*NL*
downstairs
herself
.
On
entering
the
drawing-room
she
found
the
whole
*NL*
party
at
loo
,
and
was
immediately
invited
to
join
them
;
but
suspecting
*NL*
them
to
be
playing
high
she
declined
it
,
and
making
her
sister
the
*NL*
excuse
,
said
she
would
amuse
herself
for
the
short
time
she
could
stay
*NL*
below
,
with
a
book
.
Mr.
Hurst
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
prefer
reading
to
cards
?
''
said
he
;
``
that
is
rather
singular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Eliza
Bennet
,
''
said
Miss
Bingley
,
``
despises
cards
.
She
is
a
great
*NL*
reader
,
and
has
no
pleasure
in
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
deserve
neither
such
praise
nor
such
censure
,
''
cried
Elizabeth
;
``
I
am
*NL*
_
not
_
a
great
reader
,
and
I
have
pleasure
in
many
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
nursing
your
sister
I
am
sure
you
have
pleasure
,
''
said
Bingley
;
``
and
*NL*
I
hope
it
will
be
soon
increased
by
seeing
her
quite
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
thanked
him
from
her
heart
,
and
then
walked
towards
the
*NL*
table
where
a
few
books
were
lying
.
He
immediately
offered
to
fetch
her
*NL*
others
--
all
that
his
library
afforded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
wish
my
collection
were
larger
for
your
benefit
and
my
own
*NL*
credit
;
but
I
am
an
idle
fellow
,
and
though
I
have
not
many
,
I
have
more
*NL*
than
I
ever
looked
into
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
assured
him
that
she
could
suit
herself
perfectly
with
those
*NL*
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
astonished
,
''
said
Miss
Bingley
,
``
that
my
father
should
have
left
*NL*
so
small
a
collection
of
books
.
What
a
delightful
library
you
have
at
*NL*
Pemberley
,
Mr.
Darcy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ought
to
be
good
,
''
he
replied
,
``
it
has
been
the
work
of
many
*NL*
generations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
you
have
added
so
much
to
it
yourself
,
you
are
always
buying
*NL*
books
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
comprehend
the
neglect
of
a
family
library
in
such
days
as
*NL*
these
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neglect
!
I
am
sure
you
neglect
nothing
that
can
add
to
the
beauties
of
*NL*
that
noble
place

Charles
,
when
you
build
_
your
_
house
,
I
wish
it
may
be
*NL*
half
as
delightful
as
Pemberley

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
it
may
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
would
really
advise
you
to
make
your
purchase
in
that
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
and
take
Pemberley
for
a
kind
of
model
.
There
is
not
a

finer
county
in
England
than
Derbyshire

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart

I
will
buy
Pemberley
itself

Darcy
will
sell
it

talking

possibilities

Upon
my

it
more
possible

Pemberley

purchase

imitation

''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
so
much
caught
with
what
passed
,
as
to
leave
her
very
*NL*
little
attention
for
her
book
;
and
soon
laying
it
wholly
aside
,
she
drew
*NL*
near
the
card-table
,
and
stationed
herself
between
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
*NL*
eldest
sister
,
to
observe
the
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Miss
Darcy
much
grown
since
the
spring
?

said
Miss
Bingley
;
``
will
*NL*
she
be
as
tall
as
I
am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
will

She
is
now
about

height

rather
taller

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
long

And
so
extremely
accomplished

performance
on

pianoforte
is
exquisite

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
amazing

me

Bingley

``

scarcely

I
never

*NL*
``
Your

Darcy
,

too
much

by
netting

I
am
very
*NL*
far
from
agreeing

your
estimation

in
general

I
*NL*
can
not
boast
of
knowing
more
than
half-a-dozen

observed
Elizabeth

cried
his
faithful

no
one
can
be
really

esteemed
accomplished

greatly
surpass
what

music

singing

drawing

dancing
,

the
modern
languages

deserve

the
tone

half-deserved

*NL*
``
All
this

must
possess

added
Darcy

to
all
this
she

yet
add
something
more
substantial

the
improvement

extensive
reading

*NL*
``
I
am
no

surprised

severe

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
both
cried
out
against
the
injustice
of
her
*NL*
implied
doubt
,
and
were
both
protesting
that
they
knew
many
women
who
*NL*
answered
this
description
,
when
Mr.
Hurst
called
them
to
order
,
with
*NL*
bitter
complaints
of
their
inattention
to
what
was
going
forward

As
all
*NL*
conversation
was
thereby
at
an
end
,
Elizabeth
soon
afterwards
left
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elizabeth
Bennet

''
said
Miss
Bingley
,
when
the
door
was
closed
on
her
,
*NL*
``
is
one
of
those
young

recommend

undervaluing

;

with
many
men

I
dare
say

it

succeeds

,
in

it

very
mean
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
,
''
replied
Darcy
,
to
whom
this
remark
was
chiefly
addressed
,
*NL*
``
there
is
a
meanness
in
_
all
_
the
arts
which
ladies
sometimes
condescend
*NL*
to
employ
for
captivation
.
Whatever
bears
affinity
to
cunning
is
*NL*
despicable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
was
not
so
entirely
satisfied
with
this
reply
as
to
*NL*
continue
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
joined
them
again
only
to
say
that
her
sister
was
worse
,
and
*NL*
that
she
could
not
leave
her
.
Bingley
urged
Mr.
Jones
being
sent
for
*NL*
immediately
;
while
his
sisters
,
convinced
that
no
country
advice
could
*NL*
be
of
any
service
,
recommended
an
express
to
town
for
one
of
the
most
*NL*
eminent
physicians
.
This
she
would
not
hear
of
;
but
she
was
not
so
*NL*
unwilling
to
comply
with
their
brother
's
proposal
;
and
it
was
settled
*NL*
that
Mr.
Jones
should
be
sent
for
early
in
the
morning
,
if
Miss
Bennet
*NL*
were
not
decidedly
better
.
Bingley
was
quite
uncomfortable
;
his
sisters
*NL*
declared
that
they
were
miserable
.
They
solaced
their
wretchedness
,
*NL*
however
,
by
duets
after
supper
,
while
he
could
find
no
better
relief
*NL*
to
his
feelings
than
by
giving
his
housekeeper
directions
that
every
*NL*
attention
might
be
paid
to
the
sick
lady
and
her
sister
.

Chapter
9
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
passed
the
chief
of
the
night
in
her
sister
's
room
,
and
in
the
*NL*
morning
had
the
pleasure
of
being
able
to
send
a
tolerable
answer
to
the
*NL*
inquiries
which
she
very
early
received
from
Mr.
Bingley
by
a
housemaid
,
*NL*
and
some
time
afterwards
from
the
two
elegant
ladies
who
waited
on
his
*NL*
sisters
.
In
spite
of
this
amendment
,
however
,
she
requested
to
have
a
*NL*
note
sent
to
Longbourn
,
desiring
her
mother
to
visit
Jane
,
and
form
her
*NL*
own
judgement
of
her
situation
.
The
note
was
immediately
dispatched
,
and
*NL*
its
contents
as
quickly
complied
with
.
Mrs.
Bennet
,
accompanied
by
her
*NL*
two
youngest
girls
,
reached
Netherfield
soon
after
the
family
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
she
found
Jane
in
any
apparent
danger
,
Mrs.
Bennet
would
have
been
*NL*
very
miserable
;
but
being
satisfied
on
seeing
her
that
her
illness
was
*NL*
not
alarming
,
she
had
no
wish
of
her
recovering
immediately
,
as
her
*NL*
restoration
to
health
would
probably
remove
her
from
Netherfield
.
She
*NL*
would
not
listen
,
therefore
,
to
her
daughter
's
proposal
of
being
carried
*NL*
home
;
neither
did
the
apothecary
,
who
arrived
about
the
same
time
,
think
*NL*
it
at
all
advisable
.
After
sitting
a
little
while
with
Jane
,
on
Miss
*NL*
Bingley
's
appearance
and
invitation
,
the
mother
and
three
daughters
all
*NL*
attended
her
into
the
breakfast
parlour
.
Bingley
met
them
with
hopes
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Bennet
had
not
found
Miss
Bennet
worse
than
she
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
have
,
sir
,
''
was
her
answer
.
``
She
is
a
great
deal
too
ill
to
be
*NL*
moved
.
Mr.
Jones
says
we
must
not
think
of
moving
her
.
We
must
trespass
*NL*
a
little
longer
on
your
kindness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Removed
!
''
cried
Bingley
.
``
It
must
not
be
thought
of
.
My
sister
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
,
will
not
hear
of
her
removal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
Madam
,
''
said
Miss
Bingley
,
with
cold
civility
,
*NL*
``
that
Miss
Bennet
will
receive
every
possible
attention
while
she
*NL*
remains
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
was
profuse
in
her
acknowledgments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
''
she
added
,
``
if
it
was
not
for
such
good
friends
I
do
not
*NL*
know
what
would
become
of
her
,
for
she
is
very
ill
indeed
,
and
suffers
*NL*
a
vast
deal
,
though
with
the
greatest
patience
in
the
world
,
which
is
*NL*
always
the
way
with
her
,
for
she
has
,
without
exception
,
the
sweetest
*NL*
temper
I
have
ever
met
with
.
I
often
tell
my
other
girls
they
are
*NL*
nothing
to
_
her
_
.
You
have
a
sweet
room
here
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
and
a
*NL*
charming
prospect
over
the
gravel
walk
.
I
do
not
know
a
place
in
the
*NL*
country
that
is
equal
to
Netherfield
.
You
will
not
think
of
quitting
it
*NL*
in
a
hurry
,
I
hope
,
though
you
have
but
a
short
lease
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
I
do
is
done
in
a
hurry
,
''
replied
he
;
``
and
therefore
if
I
*NL*
should
resolve
to
quit
Netherfield
,
I
should
probably
be
off
in
five
*NL*
minutes
.
At
present
,
however
,
I
consider
myself
as
quite
fixed
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
exactly
what
I
should
have
supposed
of
you
,
''
said
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
begin
to
comprehend
me
,
do
you
?
''
cried
he
,
turning
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
--
I
understand
you
perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
might
take
this
for
a
compliment
;
but
to
be
so
easily
seen
*NL*
through
I
am
afraid
is
pitiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
as
it
happens
.
It
does
not
follow
that
a
deep
,
intricate
*NL*
character
is
more
or
less
estimable
than
such
a
one
as
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizzy
,
''
cried
her
mother
,
``
remember
where
you
are
,
and
do
not
run
on
in
*NL*
the
wild
manner
that
you
are
suffered
to
do
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
before
,
''
continued
Bingley
immediately
,
``
that
you
were
a
*NL*
studier
of
character
.
It
must
be
an
amusing
study
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
intricate
characters
are
the
_
most
_
amusing
.
They
have
at
*NL*
least
that
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
country
,
''
said
Darcy
,
``
can
in
general
supply
but
a
few
subjects
for
*NL*
such
a
study
.
In
a
country
neighbourhood
you
move
in
a
very
confined
and
*NL*
unvarying
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
people
themselves
alter
so
much
,
that
there
is
something
new
to
be
*NL*
observed
in
them
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Bennet
,
offended
by
his
manner
of
mentioning
*NL*
a
country
neighbourhood
.
``
I
assure
you
there
is
quite
as
much
of
_
that
_
*NL*
going
on
in
the
country
as
in
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
was
surprised
,
and
Darcy
,
after
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
turned
silently
away
.
Mrs.
Bennet
,
who
fancied
she
had
gained
a
complete
*NL*
victory
over
him
,
continued
her
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
see
that
London
has
any
great
advantage
over
the
country
,
for
*NL*
my
part
,
except
the
shops
and
public
places
.
The
country
is
a
vast
deal
*NL*
pleasanter
,
is
it
not
,
Mr.
Bingley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
am
in
the
country
,
''
he
replied
,
``
I
never
wish
to
leave
it
;
*NL*
and
when
I
am
in
town
it
is
pretty
much
the
same
.
They
have
each
their
*NL*
advantages
,
and
I
can
be
equally
happy
in
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
--
that
is
because
you
have
the
right
disposition
.
But
that
*NL*
gentleman
,
''
looking
at
Darcy
,
``
seemed
to
think
the
country
was
nothing
*NL*
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Mamma
,
you
are
mistaken
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
blushing
for
her
*NL*
mother
.
``
You
quite
mistook
Mr.
Darcy
.
He
only
meant
that
there
was
not
*NL*
such
a
variety
of
people
to
be
met
with
in
the
country
as
in
the
town
,
*NL*
which
you
must
acknowledge
to
be
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
my
dear
,
nobody
said
there
were
;
but
as
to
not
meeting
*NL*
with
many
people
in
this
neighbourhood
,
I
believe
there
are
few
*NL*
neighbourhoods
larger
.
I
know
we
dine
with
four-and-twenty
families
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
but
concern
for
Elizabeth
could
enable
Bingley
to
keep
his
*NL*
countenance
.
His
sister
was
less
delicate
,
and
directed
her
eyes
towards
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
with
a
very
expressive
smile
.
Elizabeth
,
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
saying
something
that
might
turn
her
mother
's
thoughts
,
now
asked
her
if
*NL*
Charlotte
Lucas
had
been
at
Longbourn
since
_
her
_
coming
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
called
yesterday
with
her
father
.
What
an
agreeable
man
Sir
*NL*
William
is
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
is
not
he
?
So
much
the
man
of
fashion
!
So
*NL*
genteel
and
easy
!
He
has
always
something
to
say
to
everybody
.
_
That
_
*NL*
is
my
idea
of
good
breeding
;
and
those
persons
who
fancy
themselves
very
*NL*
important
,
and
never
open
their
mouths
,
quite
mistake
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Charlotte
dine
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
would
go
home
.
I
fancy
she
was
wanted
about
the
mince-pies
.
For
*NL*
my
part
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
I
always
keep
servants
that
can
do
their
own
work
;
*NL*
_
my
_
daughters
are
brought
up
very
differently
.
But
everybody
is
to
*NL*
judge
for
themselves
,
and
the
Lucases
are
a
very
good
sort
of
girls
,
*NL*
I
assure
you
.
It
is
a
pity
they
are
not
handsome
!
Not
that
I
think
*NL*
Charlotte
so
_
very
_
plain
--
but
then
she
is
our
particular
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
seems
a
very
pleasant
young
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
dear
,
yes
;
but
you
must
own
she
is
very
plain
.
Lady
Lucas
herself
*NL*
has
often
said
so
,
and
envied
me
Jane
's
beauty
.
I
do
not
like
to
boast
*NL*
of
my
own
child
,
but
to
be
sure
,
Jane
--
one
does
not
often
see
anybody
*NL*
better
looking
.
It
is
what
everybody
says
.
I
do
not
trust
my
own
*NL*
partiality
.
When
she
was
only
fifteen
,
there
was
a
man
at
my
brother
*NL*
Gardiner
's
in
town
so
much
in
love
with
her
that
my
sister-in-law
was
*NL*
sure
he
would
make
her
an
offer
before
we
came
away
.
But
,
however
,
he
*NL*
did
not
.
Perhaps
he
thought
her
too
young
.
However
,
he
wrote
some
verses
*NL*
on
her
,
and
very
pretty
they
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
ended
his
affection
,
''
said
Elizabeth
impatiently
.
``
There
has
*NL*
been
many
a
one
,
I
fancy
,
overcome
in
the
same
way
.
I
wonder
who
first
*NL*
discovered
the
efficacy
of
poetry
in
driving
away
love
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
used
to
consider
poetry
as
the
_
food
_
of
love
,
''
said
Darcy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
a
fine
,
stout
,
healthy
love
it
may
.
Everything
nourishes
what
is
*NL*
strong
already
.
But
if
it
be
only
a
slight
,
thin
sort
of
inclination
,
I
*NL*
am
convinced
that
one
good
sonnet
will
starve
it
entirely
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darcy
only
smiled
;
and
the
general
pause
which
ensued
made
Elizabeth
*NL*
tremble
lest
her
mother
should
be
exposing
herself
again
.
She
longed
to
*NL*
speak
,
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
;
and
after
a
short
silence
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
began
repeating
her
thanks
to
Mr.
Bingley
for
his
kindness
to
*NL*
Jane
,
with
an
apology
for
troubling
him
also
with
Lizzy
.
Mr.
Bingley
was
*NL*
unaffectedly
civil
in
his
answer
,
and
forced
his
younger
sister
to
be
*NL*
civil
also
,
and
say
what
the
occasion
required
.
She
performed
her
part
*NL*
indeed
without
much
graciousness
,
but
Mrs.
Bennet
was
satisfied
,
and
*NL*
soon
afterwards
ordered
her
carriage
.
Upon
this
signal
,
the
youngest
of
*NL*
her
daughters
put
herself
forward
.
The
two
girls
had
been
whispering
to
*NL*
each
other
during
the
whole
visit
,
and
the
result
of
it
was
,
that
the
*NL*
youngest
should
tax
Mr.
Bingley
with
having
promised
on
his
first
coming
*NL*
into
the
country
to
give
a
ball
at
Netherfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydia
was
a
stout
,
well-grown
girl
of
fifteen
,
with
a
fine
complexion
*NL*
and
good-humoured
countenance
;
a
favourite
with
her
mother
,
whose
*NL*
affection
had
brought
her
into
public
at
an
early
age
.
She
had
high
*NL*
animal
spirits
,
and
a
sort
of
natural
self-consequence
,
which
the
*NL*
attention
of
the
officers
,
to
whom
her
uncle
's
good
dinners
,
and
her
own
*NL*
easy
manners
recommended
her
,
had
increased
into
assurance
.
She
was
very
*NL*
equal
,
therefore
,
to
address
Mr.
Bingley
on
the
subject
of
the
ball
,
and
*NL*
abruptly
reminded
him
of
his
promise
;
adding
,
that
it
would
be
the
most
*NL*
shameful
thing
in
the
world
if
he
did
not
keep
it
.
His
answer
to
this
*NL*
sudden
attack
was
delightful
to
their
mother
's
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
perfectly
ready
,
I
assure
you
,
to
keep
my
engagement
;
and
when
*NL*
your
sister
is
recovered
,
you
shall
,
if
you
please
,
name
the
very
day
of
*NL*
the
ball
.
But
you
would
not
wish
to
be
dancing
when
she
is
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydia
declared
herself
satisfied
.
``
Oh
!
yes
--
it
would
be
much
better
to
*NL*
wait
till
Jane
was
well
,
and
by
that
time
most
likely
Captain
Carter
*NL*
would
be
at
Meryton
again
.
And
when
you
have
given
_
your
_
ball
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
``
I
shall
insist
on
their
giving
one
also
.
I
shall
tell
Colonel
*NL*
Forster
it
will
be
quite
a
shame
if
he
does
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
and
her
daughters
then
departed
,
and
Elizabeth
returned
*NL*
instantly
to
Jane
,
leaving
her
own
and
her
relations
'
behaviour
to
the
*NL*
remarks
of
the
two
ladies
and
Mr.
Darcy
;
the
latter
of
whom
,
however
,
*NL*
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
join
in
their
censure
of
_
her
_

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
passed
much
as
the
day
before
had
done
.
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
*NL*
Bingley
had
spent
some
hours
of
the
morning
with
the
invalid
,
who
*NL*
continued
,
though
slowly
,
to
mend
;
and
in
the
evening
Elizabeth
joined
*NL*
their
party
in
the
drawing-room
.
The
loo-table
,
however
,
did
not
appear
.
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
was
writing
,
and
Miss
Bingley
,
seated
near
him
,
was
watching
*NL*
the
progress
of
his
letter
and
repeatedly
calling
off
his
attention
by
*NL*
messages
to
his
sister
.
Mr.
Hurst
and
Mr.
Bingley
were
at
piquet
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurst
was
observing
their
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
took
up
some
needlework
,
and
was
sufficiently
amused
in
*NL*
attending
to
what
passed
between
Darcy
and
his
companion
.
The
perpetual
*NL*
commendations
of
the
lady
,
either
on
his
handwriting
,
or
on
the
evenness
*NL*
of
his
lines
,
or
on
the
length
of
his
letter
,
with
the
perfect
unconcern
*NL*
with
which
her
praises
were
received
,
formed
a
curious
dialogue
,
and
was
*NL*
exactly
in
union
with
her
opinion
of
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
delighted
Miss
Darcy
will
be
to
receive
such
a
letter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
write
uncommonly
fast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
.
I
write
rather
slowly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
letters
you
must
have
occasion
to
write
in
the
course
of
a
*NL*
year
!
Letters
of
business
,
too
!
How
odious
I
should
think
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
fortunate
,
then
,
that
they
fall
to
my
lot
instead
of
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
tell
your
sister
that
I
long
to
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
told
her
so
once
,
by
your
desire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
you
do
not
like
your
pen
.
Let
me
mend
it
for
you

I
mend
*NL*
pens
remarkably
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
--
but
I
always
mend
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
contrive
to
write
so
even
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
your
sister
I
am
delighted
to
hear
of
her
improvement
on
the
harp
;
*NL*
and
pray
let
her
know
that
I
am
quite
in
raptures
with
her
beautiful
*NL*
little
design
for
a
table
,
and
I
think
it
infinitely
superior
to
Miss
*NL*
Grantley
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
give
me
leave
to
defer
your
raptures
till
I
write
again
?
At
*NL*
present
I
have
not
room
to
do
them
justice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
it
is
of
no
consequence
.
I
shall
see
her
in
January
.
But
do
you
*NL*
always
write
such
charming
long
letters
to
her
,
Mr.
Darcy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
generally
long
;
but
whether
always
charming
it
is
not
for
me
*NL*
to
determine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
rule
with
me
,
that
a
person
who
can
write
a
long
letter
with
*NL*
ease
,
can
not
write
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
not
do
for
a
compliment
to
Darcy
,
Caroline
,
''
cried
her
*NL*
brother
,
``
because
he
does
_
not
_
write
with
ease
.
He
studies
too
much
for
*NL*
words
of
four
syllables
.
Do
not
you
,
Darcy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
style
of
writing
is
very
different
from
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
cried
Miss
Bingley
,
``
Charles
writes
in
the
most
careless
way
*NL*
imaginable
.
He
leaves
out
half
his
words
,
and
blots
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
ideas
flow
so
rapidly
that
I
have
not
time
to
express
them
--
by
which
*NL*
means
my
letters
sometimes
convey
no
ideas
at
all
to
my
correspondents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
humility
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
must
disarm
reproof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
is
more
deceitful
,
''
said
Darcy
,
``
than
the
appearance
of
*NL*
humility
.
It
is
often
only
carelessness
of
opinion
,
and
sometimes
an
*NL*
indirect
boast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
which
of
the
two
do
you
call
_
my
_
little
recent
piece
of
modesty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
indirect
boast
;
for
you
are
really
proud
of
your
defects
in
*NL*
writing
,
because
you
consider
them
as
proceeding
from
a
rapidity
of
*NL*
thought
and
carelessness
of
execution
,
which
,
if
not
estimable
,
you
*NL*
think
at
least
highly
interesting
.
The
power
of
doing
anything
with
*NL*
quickness
is
always
prized
much
by
the
possessor
,
and
often
without
any
*NL*
attention
to
the
imperfection
of
the
performance
.
When
you
told
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
this
morning
that
if
you
ever
resolved
upon
quitting
Netherfield
*NL*
you
should
be
gone
in
five
minutes
,
you
meant
it
to
be
a
sort
of
*NL*
panegyric
,
of
compliment
to
yourself
--
and
yet
what
is
there
so
very
*NL*
laudable
in
a
precipitance
which
must
leave
very
necessary
business
*NL*
undone
,
and
can
be
of
no
real
advantage
to
yourself
or
anyone
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
cried
Bingley
,
``
this
is
too
much
,
to
remember
at
night
all
the
*NL*
foolish
things
that
were
said
in
the
morning
.
And
yet
,
upon
my
honour
,
*NL*
I
believe
what
I
said
of
myself
to
be
true
,
and
I
believe
it
at
this
*NL*
moment
.
At
least
,
therefore
,
I
did
not
assume
the
character
of
needless
*NL*
precipitance
merely
to
show
off
before
the
ladies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
you
believed
it
;
but
I
am
by
no
means
convinced
that
*NL*
you
would
be
gone
with
such
celerity
.
Your
conduct
would
be
quite
as
*NL*
dependent
on
chance
as
that
of
any
man
I
know
;
and
if
,
as
you
were
*NL*
mounting
your
horse
,
a
friend
were
to
say
,
`
Bingley
,
you
had
better
*NL*
stay
till
next
week
,

you
would
probably
do
it
,
you
would
probably
not
*NL*
go
--
and
at
another
word
,
might
stay
a
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
only
proved
by
this
,
''
cried
Elizabeth
,
``
that
Mr.
Bingley
did
*NL*
not
do
justice
to
his
own
disposition
.
You
have
shown
him
off
now
much
*NL*
more
than
he
did
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
exceedingly
gratified
,
''
said
Bingley
,
``
by
your
converting
what
my
*NL*
friend
says
into
a
compliment
on
the
sweetness
of
my
temper
.
But
I
am
*NL*
afraid
you
are
giving
it
a
turn
which
that
gentleman
did
by
no
means
*NL*
intend
;
for
he
would
certainly
think
better
of
me
,
if
under
such
a
*NL*
circumstance
I
were
to
give
a
flat
denial
,
and
ride
off
as
fast
as
I
*NL*
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
Mr.
Darcy
then
consider
the
rashness
of
your
original
intentions
*NL*
as
atoned
for
by
your
obstinacy
in
adhering
to
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
I
can
not
exactly
explain
the
matter
;
Darcy
must
speak
for
*NL*
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
expect
me
to
account
for
opinions
which
you
choose
to
call
mine
,
*NL*
but
which
I
have
never
acknowledged
.
Allowing
the
case
,
however
,
to
*NL*
stand
according
to
your
representation
,
you
must
remember
,
Miss
Bennet
,
*NL*
that
the
friend
who
is
supposed
to
desire
his
return
to
the
house
,
and
*NL*
the
delay
of
his
plan
,
has
merely
desired
it
,
asked
it
without
offering
*NL*
one
argument
in
favour
of
its
propriety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
yield
readily
--
easily
--
to
the
_
persuasion
_
of
a
friend
is
no
merit
*NL*
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
yield
without
conviction
is
no
compliment
to
the
understanding
of
*NL*
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
appear
to
me
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
to
allow
nothing
for
the
influence
of
*NL*
friendship
and
affection

A
regard
for
the
requester
would
often
make
*NL*
one
readily
yield
to
a
request
,
without
waiting
for
arguments
to
reason
*NL*
one
into
it
.
I
am
not
particularly
speaking
of
such
a
case
as
you
have
*NL*
supposed
about
Mr.
Bingley
.
We
may
as
well
wait
,
perhaps
,
till
the
*NL*
circumstance
occurs
before
we
discuss
the
discretion
of
his
behaviour
*NL*
thereupon

But
in
general
and
ordinary
cases
between
friend
and
friend

*NL*
where
one
of
them
is
desired
by
the
other
to
change
a
resolution
of
no
*NL*
very
great
moment

should
you
think
ill
of
that
person

complying

the
desire

waiting

be
argued
into
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
it
not
be
advisable
,
before
we
proceed
on
this
subject
,
to
*NL*
arrange
with
rather
more
precision
the
degree
of
importance
which
is
to
*NL*
appertain
to
this
request

as
well
as
the
degree
of
intimacy
subsisting
*NL*
between

parties

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
''
cried
Bingley
;
``
let
us
hear
all
the
particulars
,
not
*NL*
forgetting
their
comparative
height
and
size
;
for
that
will
have
more
*NL*
weight
in
the
argument
,
Miss
Bennet
,
than
you
may
be
aware
of
.
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
that
if
Darcy
were
not
such
a
great
tall
fellow
,
in
comparison
with
*NL*
myself
,
I
should
not
pay
him
half
so
much
deference
.
I
declare
I
do
not
*NL*
know
a
more
awful
object
than
Darcy
,
on
particular
occasions
,
and
in
*NL*
particular
places
;
at
his
own
house
especially
,
and
of
a
Sunday
evening
,
*NL*
when
he
has
nothing
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
smiled
;
but
Elizabeth
thought
she
could
perceive
that
he
was
*NL*
rather
offended
,
and
therefore
checked
her
laugh
.
Miss
Bingley
warmly
*NL*
resented
the
indignity
he
had
received
,
in
an
expostulation
with
her
*NL*
brother
for
talking
such
nonsense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
your
design
,
Bingley
,
''
said
his
friend
.
``
You
dislike
an
argument
,
*NL*
and
want
to
silence
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
do
.
Arguments
are
too
much
like
disputes
.
If
you
and
Miss
*NL*
Bennet
will
defer
yours
till
I
am
out
of
the
room
,
I
shall
be
very
*NL*
thankful
;
and
then
you
may
say
whatever
you
like
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
ask
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
is
no
sacrifice
on
my
side
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
had
much
better
finish
his
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
took
her
advice
,
and
did
finish
his
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
that
business
was
over
,
he
applied
to
Miss
Bingley
and
Elizabeth
*NL*
for
an
indulgence
of
some
music
.
Miss
Bingley
moved
with
some
alacrity
*NL*
to
the
pianoforte
;
and
,
after
a
polite
request
that
Elizabeth
would
lead
*NL*
the
way
which
the
other
as
politely
and
more
earnestly
negatived
,
she
*NL*
seated
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurst
sang
with
her
sister
,
and
while
they
were
thus
employed
,
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
not
help
observing
,
as
she
turned
over
some
music-books
*NL*
that
lay
on
the
instrument
,
how
frequently
Mr.
Darcy
's
eyes
were
fixed
*NL*
on
her
.
She
hardly
knew
how
to
suppose
that
she
could
be
an
object
of
*NL*
admiration
to
so
great
a
man
;
and
yet
that
he
should
look
at
her
*NL*
because
he
disliked
her
,
was
still
more
strange
.
She
could
only
imagine
,
*NL*
however
,
at
last
that
she
drew
his
notice
because
there
was
something
*NL*
more
wrong
and
reprehensible
,
according
to
his
ideas
of
right
,
than
in
*NL*
any
other
person
present
.
The
supposition
did
not
pain
her
.
She
liked
*NL*
him
too
little
to
care
for
his
approbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
playing
some
Italian
songs
,
Miss
Bingley
varied
the
charm
by
*NL*
a
lively
Scotch
air
;
and
soon
afterwards
Mr.
Darcy
,
drawing
near
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
said
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
you
feel
a
great
inclination
,
Miss
Bennet
,
to
seize
such
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
dancing
a
reel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
,
but
made
no
answer
.
He
repeated
the
question
,
with
some
*NL*
surprise
at
her
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
she
,
``
I
heard
you
before
,
but
I
could
not
immediately
*NL*
determine
what
to
say
in
reply
.
You
wanted
me
,
I
know
,
to
say
`
Yes
,
'
*NL*
that
you
might
have
the
pleasure
of
despising
my
taste
;
but
I
always
*NL*
delight
in
overthrowing
those
kind
of
schemes
,
and
cheating
a
person
of
*NL*
their
premeditated
contempt
.
I
have
,
therefore
,
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
*NL*
you
,
that
I
do
not
want
to
dance
a
reel
at
all
--
and
now
despise
me
if
*NL*
you
dare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
do
not
dare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
having
rather
expected
to
affront
him
,
was
amazed
at
his
*NL*
gallantry
;
but
there
was
a
mixture
of
sweetness
and
archness
in
her
*NL*
manner
which
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
affront
anybody
;
and
Darcy
*NL*
had
never
been
so
bewitched
by
any
woman
as
he
was
by
her
.
He
really
*NL*
believed
,
that
were
it
not
for
the
inferiority
of
her
connections
,
he
*NL*
should
be
in
some
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
saw
,
or
suspected
enough
to
be
jealous
;
and
her
great
*NL*
anxiety
for
the
recovery
of
her
dear
friend
Jane
received
some
*NL*
assistance
from
her
desire
of
getting
rid
of
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
often
tried
to
provoke
Darcy
into
disliking
her
guest
,
by
talking
of
*NL*
their
supposed
marriage
,
and
planning
his
happiness
in
such
an
alliance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
''
said
she
,
as
they
were
walking
together
in
the
shrubbery
*NL*
the
next
day
,
``
you
will
give
your
mother-in-law
a
few
hints
,
when
this
*NL*
desirable
event
takes
place

the
advantage
of
holding
her
tongue
;
*NL*
and
if
you
can
compass
it
,
do
cure
the
younger
girls
of
running
after
*NL*
officers
.
And
,
if
I
may
mention
so
delicate
a
subject
,
endeavour
to
*NL*
check
that
little
something
,
bordering
on
conceit
and
impertinence
,
*NL*
which
your
lady
possesses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
anything
else
to
propose
for
my
domestic
felicity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
.
Do
let
the
portraits
of
your
uncle
and
aunt
Phillips
be
placed
*NL*
in
the
gallery
at
Pemberley
.
Put
them
next
to
your
great-uncle
the
*NL*
judge
.
They
are
in
the
same
profession
,
you
know
,
only
in
different
*NL*
lines
.
As
for
your
Elizabeth
's
picture
,
you
must
not
have
it
taken
,
for
*NL*
what
painter
could
do
justice
to
those
beautiful
eyes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
not
be
easy
,
indeed
,
to
catch
their
expression
,
but
their
*NL*
colour
and
shape
,
and
the
eyelashes
,
so
remarkably
fine
,
might
be
*NL*
copied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
they
were
met
from
another
walk
by
Mrs.
Hurst
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
that
you
intended
to
walk
,
''
said
Miss
Bingley
,
in
some
*NL*
confusion
,
lest
they
had
been
overheard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
used
us
abominably
ill
,
''
answered
Mrs.
Hurst
,
``
running
away
without
*NL*
telling
us
that
you
were
coming
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
taking
the
disengaged
arm
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
she
left
Elizabeth
to
walk
*NL*
by
herself
.
The
path
just
admitted
three
.
Mr.
Darcy
felt
their
rudeness
,
*NL*
and
immediately
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
walk
is
not
wide
enough
for
our
party
.
We
had
better
go
into
the
*NL*
avenue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Elizabeth
,
who
had
not
the
least
inclination
to
remain
with
them
,
*NL*
laughingly
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
stay
where
you
are
.
You
are
charmingly
grouped
,
and
appear
*NL*
to
uncommon
advantage
.
The
picturesque
would
be
spoilt
by
admitting
a
*NL*
fourth
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
ran
gaily
off
,
rejoicing
as
she
rambled
about
,
in
the
hope
of
*NL*
being
at
home
again
in
a
day
or
two
.
Jane
was
already
so
much
recovered
*NL*
as
to
intend
leaving
her
room
for
a
couple
of
hours
that
evening
.

Chapter
11
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
ladies
removed
after
dinner
,
Elizabeth
ran
up
to
her
*NL*
sister
,
and
seeing
her
well
guarded
from
cold
,
attended
her
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
where
she
was
welcomed
by
her
two
friends
with
many
*NL*
professions
of
pleasure
;
and
Elizabeth
had
never
seen
them
so
agreeable
*NL*
as
they
were
during
the
hour
which
passed
before
the
gentlemen
appeared
.
*NL*
Their
powers
of
conversation
were
considerable
.
They
could
describe
an
*NL*
entertainment
with
accuracy
,
relate
an
anecdote
with
humour
,
and
laugh
*NL*
at
their
acquaintance
with
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
gentlemen
entered
,
Jane
was
no
longer
the
first
object
;
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
's
eyes
were
instantly
turned
toward
Darcy
,
and
she
had
*NL*
something
to
say
to
him
before
he
had
advanced
many
steps
.
He
addressed
*NL*
himself
to
Miss
Bennet
,
with
a
polite
congratulation
;
Mr.
Hurst
also
*NL*
made
her
a
slight
bow
,
and
said
he
was
``
very
glad
;
''
but
diffuseness
*NL*
and
warmth
remained
for
Bingley
's
salutation
.
He
was
full
of
joy
and
*NL*
attention
.
The
first
half-hour
was
spent
in
piling
up
the
fire
,
lest
she
*NL*
should
suffer
from
the
change
of
room
;
and
she
removed
at
his
desire
*NL*
to
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
,
that
she
might
be
further
from
*NL*
the
door
.
He
then
sat
down
by
her
,
and
talked
scarcely
to
anyone
*NL*
else
.
Elizabeth
,
at
work
in
the
opposite
corner
,
saw
it
all
with
great
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
tea
was
over
,
Mr.
Hurst
reminded
his
sister-in-law
of
the
*NL*
card-table
--
but
in
vain
.
She
had
obtained
private
intelligence
that
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
did
not
wish
for
cards
;
and
Mr.
Hurst
soon
found
even
his
open
*NL*
petition
rejected
.
She
assured
him
that
no
one
intended
to
play
,
and
*NL*
the
silence
of
the
whole
party
on
the
subject
seemed
to
justify
her
.
Mr.
*NL*
Hurst
had
therefore
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
stretch
himself
on
one
of
the
*NL*
sofas
and
go
to
sleep
.
Darcy
took
up
a
book
;
Miss
Bingley
did
the
same
;
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Hurst
,
principally
occupied
in
playing
with
her
bracelets
*NL*
and
rings
,
joined
now
and
then
in
her
brother
's
conversation
with
Miss
*NL*
Bennet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
's
attention
was
quite
as
much
engaged
in
watching
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
's
progress
through
_
his
_
book
,
as
in
reading
her
own
;
and
she
*NL*
was
perpetually
either
making
some
inquiry
,
or
looking
at
his
page
.
She
*NL*
could
not
win
him
,
however
,
to
any
conversation
;
he
merely
answered
her
*NL*
question
,
and
read
on
.
At
length
,
quite
exhausted
by
the
attempt
to
be
*NL*
amused
with
her
own
book
,
which
she
had
only
chosen
because
it
was
the
*NL*
second
volume
of
his
,
she
gave
a
great
yawn
and
said
,
``
How
pleasant
*NL*
it
is
to
spend
an
evening
in
this
way
!
I
declare
after
all
there
is
no
*NL*
enjoyment
like
reading
!
How
much
sooner
one
tires
of
anything
than
of
a
*NL*
book
!
When
I
have
a
house
of
my
own
,
I
shall
be
miserable
if
I
have
not
*NL*
an
excellent
library
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
made
any
reply
.
She
then
yawned
again
,
threw
aside
her
book
,
and
*NL*
cast
her
eyes
round
the
room
in
quest
for
some
amusement
;
when
hearing
*NL*
her
brother
mentioning
a
ball
to
Miss
Bennet
,
she
turned
suddenly
*NL*
towards
him
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
bye
,
Charles
,
are
you
really
serious
in
meditating
a
dance
at
*NL*
Netherfield
?
I
would
advise
you
,
before
you
determine
on
it
,
to
consult
*NL*
the
wishes
of
the
present
party
;
I
am
much
mistaken
if
there
are
*NL*
not
some
among
us
to
whom
a
ball
would
be
rather
a
punishment
than
a
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
mean
Darcy
,
''
cried
her
brother
,
``
he
may
go
to
bed
,
if
he
*NL*
chooses
,
before
it
begins
--
but
as
for
the
ball
,
it
is
quite
a
settled
*NL*
thing
;
and
as
soon
as
Nicholls
has
made
white
soup
enough
,
I
shall
send
*NL*
round
my
cards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
balls
infinitely
better
,
''
she
replied
,
``
if
they
were
*NL*
carried
on
in
a
different
manner
;
but
there
is
something
insufferably
*NL*
tedious
in
the
usual
process
of
such
a
meeting
.
It
would
surely
be
much
*NL*
more
rational
if
conversation
instead
of
dancing
were
made
the
order
of
*NL*
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
more
rational
,
my
dear
Caroline
,
I
dare
say
,
but
it
would
not
be
*NL*
near
so
much
like
a
ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
made
no
answer
,
and
soon
afterwards
she
got
up
and
walked
*NL*
about
the
room
.
Her
figure
was
elegant
,
and
she
walked
well
;
but
*NL*
Darcy
,
at
whom
it
was
all
aimed
,
was
still
inflexibly
studious
.
In
*NL*
the
desperation
of
her
feelings
,
she
resolved
on
one
effort
more
,
and
,
*NL*
turning
to
Elizabeth
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Eliza
Bennet
,
let
me
persuade
you
to
follow
my
example
,
and
take
a
*NL*
turn
about
the
room
.
I
assure
you
it
is
very
refreshing
after
sitting
so
*NL*
long
in
one
attitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
surprised
,
but
agreed
to
it
immediately
.
Miss
Bingley
*NL*
succeeded
no
less
in
the
real
object
of
her
civility
;
Mr.
Darcy
looked
*NL*
up
.
He
was
as
much
awake
to
the
novelty
of
attention
in
that
quarter
as
*NL*
Elizabeth
herself
could
be
,
and
unconsciously
closed
his
book
.
He
was
*NL*
directly
invited
to
join
their
party
,
but
he
declined
it
,
observing
that
*NL*
he
could
imagine
but
two
motives
for
their
choosing
to
walk
up
and
down
*NL*
the
room
together
,
with
either
of
which
motives
his
joining
them
would
*NL*
interfere
.
``
What
could
he
mean
?
She
was
dying
to
know
what
could
be
his
*NL*
meaning
?
''
--
and
asked
Elizabeth
whether
she
could
at
all
understand
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
was
her
answer
;
``
but
depend
upon
it
,
he
means
to
be
severe
*NL*
on
us
,
and
our
surest
way
of
disappointing
him
will
be
to
ask
nothing
*NL*
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
,
however
,
was
incapable
of
disappointing
Mr.
Darcy
in
*NL*
anything
,
and
persevered
therefore
in
requiring
an
explanation
of
his
*NL*
two
motives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
the
smallest
objection
to
explaining
them
,
''
said
he
,
as
soon
*NL*
as
she
allowed
him
to
speak
.
``
You
either
choose
this
method
of
passing
*NL*
the
evening
because
you
are
in
each
other
's
confidence
,
and
have
secret
*NL*
affairs
to
discuss
,
or
because
you
are
conscious
that
your
figures
*NL*
appear
to
the
greatest
advantage
in
walking
;
if
the
first
,
I
would
be
*NL*
completely
in
your
way
,
and
if
the
second
,
I
can
admire
you
much
better
*NL*
as
I
sit
by
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
shocking
!
''
cried
Miss
Bingley
.
``
I
never
heard
anything
so
*NL*
abominable
.
How
shall
we
punish
him
for
such
a
speech
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
so
easy
,
if
you
have
but
the
inclination
,
''
said
Elizabeth
.
``
We
*NL*
can
all
plague
and
punish
one
another

Tease
him

laugh
at
him

Intimate
*NL*
as
you
are

you
must
know
how
it
is
to
be
done

*NL*
``

calmness

mind

No

no

I
feel

defy

laughter

we
will

not

laugh

himself

``
Mr.
Darcy
is
not

be
laughed
at

cried
Elizabeth
.
``
That
is
an

uncommon
advantage

uncommon
I
hope
it
will
continue

a
great
loss

``
Miss
Bingley

he

Elizabeth

Elizabeth
turned
away
to
hide
a
smile

``
Your

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

have
faults
enough

opened
;
and
Darcy
,
after
a
few
moments
'
recollection
,
was
not
sorry
for
*NL*
it
.
He
began
to
feel
the
danger
of
paying
Elizabeth
too
much
attention
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
consequence
of
an
agreement
between
the
sisters
,
Elizabeth
wrote
the
*NL*
next
morning
to
their
mother
,
to
beg
that
the
carriage
might
be
sent
for
*NL*
them
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
But
Mrs.
Bennet
,
who
had
calculated
on
*NL*
her
daughters
remaining
at
Netherfield
till
the
following
Tuesday
,
which
*NL*
would
exactly
finish
Jane
's
week
,
could
not
bring
herself
to
receive
*NL*
them
with
pleasure
before
.
Her
answer
,
therefore
,
was
not
propitious
,
at
*NL*
least
not
to
Elizabeth
's
wishes
,
for
she
was
impatient
to
get
home
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
sent
them
word
that
they
could
not
possibly
have
the
carriage
*NL*
before
Tuesday
;
and
in
her
postscript
it
was
added
,
that
if
Mr.
Bingley
*NL*
and
his
sister
pressed
them
to
stay
longer
,
she
could
spare
them
*NL*
very
well
.
Against
staying
longer
,
however
,
Elizabeth
was
positively
*NL*
resolved
--
nor
did
she
much
expect
it
would
be
asked
;
and
fearful
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
as
being
considered
as
intruding
themselves
needlessly
long
,
*NL*
she
urged
Jane
to
borrow
Mr.
Bingley
's
carriage
immediately
,
and
at
*NL*
length
it
was
settled
that
their
original
design
of
leaving
Netherfield
*NL*
that
morning
should
be
mentioned
,
and
the
request
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
communication
excited
many
professions
of
concern
;
and
enough
was
*NL*
said
of
wishing
them
to
stay
at
least
till
the
following
day
to
work
*NL*
on
Jane
;
and
till
the
morrow
their
going
was
deferred
.
Miss
Bingley
was
*NL*
then
sorry
that
she
had
proposed
the
delay
,
for
her
jealousy
and
dislike
*NL*
of
one
sister
much
exceeded
her
affection
for
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
of
the
house
heard
with
real
sorrow
that
they
were
to
go
so
*NL*
soon
,
and
repeatedly
tried
to
persuade
Miss
Bennet
that
it
would
not
be
*NL*
safe
for
her
--
that
she
was
not
enough
recovered
;
but
Jane
was
firm
where
*NL*
she
felt
herself
to
be
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Mr.
Darcy
it
was
welcome
intelligence
--
Elizabeth
had
been
at
*NL*
Netherfield
long
enough
.
She
attracted
him
more
than
he
liked
--
and
Miss
*NL*
Bingley
was
uncivil
to
_
her
_
,
and
more
teasing
than
usual
to
himself
.
*NL*
He
wisely
resolved
to
be
particularly
careful
that
no
sign
of
admiration
*NL*
should
_
now
_
escape
him
,
nothing
that
could
elevate
her
with
the
hope
*NL*
of
influencing
his
felicity
;
sensible
that
if
such
an
idea
had
been
*NL*
suggested
,
his
behaviour
during
the
last
day
must
have
material
weight
*NL*
in
confirming
or
crushing
it
.
Steady
to
his
purpose
,
he
scarcely
spoke
*NL*
ten
words
to
her
through
the
whole
of
Saturday
,
and
though
they
were
*NL*
at
one
time
left
by
themselves
for
half-an-hour
,
he
adhered
most
*NL*
conscientiously
to
his
book
,
and
would
not
even
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sunday
,
after
morning
service
,
the
separation
,
so
agreeable
to
almost
*NL*
all
,
took
place
.
Miss
Bingley
's
civility
to
Elizabeth
increased
at
last
*NL*
very
rapidly
,
as
well
as
her
affection
for
Jane
;
and
when
they
parted
,
*NL*
after
assuring
the
latter
of
the
pleasure
it
would
always
give
her
*NL*
to
see
her
either
at
Longbourn
or
Netherfield
,
and
embracing
her
most
*NL*
tenderly
,
she
even
shook
hands
with
the
former
.
Elizabeth
took
leave
of
*NL*
the
whole
party
in
the
liveliest
of
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
not
welcomed
home
very
cordially
by
their
mother
.
Mrs.
Bennet
*NL*
wondered
at
their
coming
,
and
thought
them
very
wrong
to
give
so
much
*NL*
trouble
,
and
was
sure
Jane
would
have
caught
cold
again
.
But
their
*NL*
father
,
though
very
laconic
in
his
expressions
of
pleasure
,
was
really
*NL*
glad
to
see
them
;
he
had
felt
their
importance
in
the
family
circle
.
The
*NL*
evening
conversation
,
when
they
were
all
assembled
,
had
lost
much
of
*NL*
its
animation
,
and
almost
all
its
sense
by
the
absence
of
Jane
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
Mary
,
as
usual
,
deep
in
the
study
of
thorough-bass
and
human
*NL*
nature
;
and
had
some
extracts
to
admire
,
and
some
new
observations
of
*NL*
threadbare
morality
to
listen
to
.
Catherine
and
Lydia
had
information
*NL*
for
them
of
a
different
sort
.
Much
had
been
done
and
much
had
been
said
*NL*
in
the
regiment
since
the
preceding
Wednesday
;
several
of
the
officers
*NL*
had
dined
lately
with
their
uncle
,
a
private
had
been
flogged
,
and
it
*NL*
had
actually
been
hinted
that
Colonel
Forster
was
going
to
be
married
.

Mr.

to

were
at

the

,
``

sees
such
at

*NL*
``
The

of
whom
I
speak
is
a

a

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
's
eyes
sparkled
.
``
A

It
is
Mr.
*NL*
Bingley

Well

I
am
sure
I
shall
be
extremely
glad
to
see

But

good
Lord

how
unlucky

is
not
a

got
to-day

moment

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
_
not

Mr.
Bingley

''
said
her
husband
;
``
it
is
a
person
whom
I
*NL*
never
saw
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
roused
a
general
astonishment
;
and
he
had
the
pleasure
of
being
*NL*
eagerly
questioned
by
his
wife
and
his
five
daughters
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
amusing
himself
some
time
with
their
curiosity
,
he
thus
explained
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
a
month
ago
I
received
this
letter
;
and
about
a
fortnight
ago
*NL*
I
answered
it
,
for
I
thought
it
a
case
of
some
delicacy
,
and
requiring
*NL*
early
attention
.
It
is
from
my
cousin
,
Mr.
Collins
,
who
,
when
I
am
dead
,
*NL*
may
turn
you
all
out
of
this
house
as
soon
as
he
pleases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
my
dear
,
''
cried
his
wife
,
``
I
can
not
bear
to
hear
that
mentioned
.
*NL*
Pray
do
not
talk
of
that
odious
man
.
I
do
think
it
is
the
hardest
thing
*NL*
in
the
world
,
that
your
estate
should
be
entailed
away
from
your
own
*NL*
children
;
and
I
am
sure
,
if
I
had
been
you
,
I
should
have
tried
long
ago
*NL*
to
do
something
or
other
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
and
Elizabeth
tried
to
explain
to
her
the
nature
of
an
entail
.
They
*NL*
had
often
attempted
to
do
it
before
,
but
it
was
a
subject
on
which
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
was
beyond
the
reach
of
reason
,
and
she
continued
to
rail
*NL*
bitterly
against
the
cruelty
of
settling
an
estate
away
from
a
family
of
*NL*
five
daughters
,
in
favour
of
a
man
whom
nobody
cared
anything
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
certainly
is
a
most
iniquitous
affair
,
''
said
Mr.
Bennet
,
``
and
*NL*
nothing
can
clear
Mr.
Collins
from
the
guilt
of
inheriting
Longbourn
.
*NL*
But
if
you
will
listen
to
his
letter
,
you
may
perhaps
be
a
little
*NL*
softened
by
his
manner
of
expressing
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
;
and
I
think
it
is
very
impertinent
of
*NL*
him
to
write
to
you
at
all
,
and
very
hypocritical
.
I
hate
such
false
*NL*
friends
.
Why
could
he
not
keep
on
quarreling
with
you
,
as
his
father
did
*NL*
before
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
indeed
;
he
does
seem
to
have
had
some
filial
scruples
on
that

head

you
will
hear

Dear
Sir

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
disagreement
subsisting
between
yourself
and
my
late
honoured
*NL*
father
always
gave
me
much
uneasiness
,
and
since
I
have
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
to
lose
him
,
I
have
frequently
wished
to
heal
the
breach
;
but
*NL*
for
some
time
I
was
kept
back
by
my
own
doubts
,
fearing
lest
it
might
*NL*
seem
disrespectful
to
his
memory
for
me
to
be
on
good
terms
with
anyone
*NL*
with
whom
it
had
always
pleased
him
to
be
at
variance
.

There
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
.
'
--
My
mind
,
however
,
is
now
made
up
on
the
subject
,
for
having
*NL*
received
ordination
at
Easter
,
I
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
be
*NL*
distinguished
by
the
patronage
of
the
Right
Honourable
Lady
Catherine
de
*NL*
Bourgh
,
widow
of
Sir
Lewis
de
Bourgh
,
whose
bounty
and
beneficence
has
*NL*
preferred
me
to
the
valuable
rectory
of
this
parish
,
where
it
shall
be
*NL*
my
earnest
endeavour
to
demean
myself
with
grateful
respect
towards
her
*NL*
ladyship
,
and
be
ever
ready
to
perform
those
rites
and
ceremonies
which
*NL*
are
instituted
by
the
Church
of
England
.
As
a
clergyman
,
moreover
,
I
*NL*
feel
it
my
duty
to
promote
and
establish
the
blessing
of
peace
in
*NL*
all
families
within
the
reach
of
my
influence
;
and
on
these
grounds
I
*NL*
flatter
myself
that
my
present
overtures
are
highly
commendable
,
and
*NL*
that
the
circumstance
of
my
being
next
in
the
entail
of
Longbourn
estate
*NL*
will
be
kindly
overlooked
on
your
side
,
and
not
lead
you
to
reject
the
*NL*
offered
olive-branch
.
I
can
not
be
otherwise
than
concerned
at
being
the
*NL*
means
of
injuring
your
amiable
daughters
,
and
beg
leave
to
apologise
for
*NL*
it

assure
you
of
my
readiness
to
make
them
every
possible
*NL*
amends

of
this
hereafter

If
you
should
have
no
objection
to
*NL*
receive
me
into
your

I
propose
myself
the
satisfaction
of
waiting
*NL*
on
you
and
your

Monday

November
18th

folded

conscientious

prove

indulgent
as

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

is
certainly
to

credit

''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
chiefly
struck
by
his
extraordinary
deference

his
kind
intention

christening

marrying

burying

it
were
required

said
she
.
``
I

out

``
No

my

I
think
not

I
have
great
hopes

finding
him
quite
the

reverse

There
is
a
mixture
of
servility
and
self-importance
in
his
*NL*
letter

promises
well

I
am
impatient
to
see

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
point
of
composition

''
said
Mary
,
``
the
letter
does
not
seem

defective

The
idea

not
wholly
new

I

it

*NL*
To
Catherine

Lydia

neither
the
letter

its
writer

degree
interesting

It
was
next
to
impossible
that
their
cousin

*NL*
come
in
a
scarlet
coat

it
was
now
some
weeks

pleasure

society
of
a
man
in
any
other
colour

As
for
*NL*
their
mother
,
Mr.
Collins
's
letter
had
done
away
much
of
her
ill-will
,
*NL*
and
she
was
preparing
to
see
him
with
a
degree
of
composure
which
*NL*
astonished
her
husband
and
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
was
punctual
to
his
time
,
and
was
received
with
great
*NL*
politeness
by
the
whole
family
.
Mr.
Bennet
indeed
said
little
;
but
the
*NL*
ladies
were
ready
enough
to
talk
,
and
Mr.
Collins
seemed
neither
in
*NL*
need
of
encouragement
,
nor
inclined
to
be
silent
himself
.
He
was
a
*NL*
tall
,
heavy-looking
young
man
of
five-and-twenty
.
His
air
was
grave
and
*NL*
stately
,
and
his
manners
were
very
formal
.
He
had
not
been
long
seated
*NL*
before
he
complimented
Mrs.
Bennet
on
having
so
fine
a
family
of
*NL*
daughters
;
said
he
had
heard
much
of
their
beauty
,
but
that
in
this
*NL*
instance
fame
had
fallen
short
of
the
truth
;
and
added
,
that
he
did
*NL*
not
doubt
her
seeing
them
all
in
due
time
disposed
of
in
marriage
.
This
*NL*
gallantry
was
not
much
to
the
taste
of
some
of
his
hearers
;
but
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
,
who
quarreled
with
no
compliments
,
answered
most
readily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
kind
,
I
am
sure
;
and
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
it
may
*NL*
prove
so
,
for
else
they
will
be
destitute
enough
.
Things
are
settled
so
*NL*
oddly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
allude
,
perhaps
,
to
the
entail
of
this
estate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
sir
,
I
do
indeed
.
It
is
a
grievous
affair
to
my
poor
girls
,
you
*NL*
must
confess
.
Not
that
I
mean
to
find
fault
with
_
you
_
,
for
such
things
*NL*
I
know
are
all
chance
in
this
world
.
There
is
no
knowing
how
estates
*NL*
will
go
when
once
they
come
to
be
entailed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sensible
,
madam
,
of
the
hardship
to
my
fair
cousins
,
and
*NL*
could
say
much
on
the
subject
,
but
that
I
am
cautious
of
appearing
*NL*
forward
and
precipitate
.
But
I
can
assure
the
young
ladies
that
I
come
*NL*
prepared
to
admire
them
.
At
present
I
will
not
say
more
;
but
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
when
we
are
better
acquainted
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
interrupted
by
a
summons
to
dinner
;
and
the
girls
smiled
on
each
*NL*
other
.
They
were
not
the
only
objects
of
Mr.
Collins
's
admiration
.
The
*NL*
hall
,
the
dining-room
,
and
all
its
furniture
,
were
examined
and
praised
;
*NL*
and
his
commendation
of
everything
would
have
touched
Mrs.
Bennet
's
*NL*
heart
,
but
for
the
mortifying
supposition
of
his
viewing
it
all
as
his
*NL*
own
future
property
.
The
dinner
too
in
its
turn
was
highly
admired
;
and
*NL*
he
begged
to
know
to
which
of
his
fair
cousins
the
excellency
of
its
*NL*
cooking
was
owing
.
But
he
was
set
right
there
by
Mrs.
Bennet
,
who
*NL*
assured
him
with
some
asperity
that
they
were
very
well
able
to
keep
a
*NL*
good
cook
,
and
that
her
daughters
had
nothing
to
do
in
the
kitchen
.
He
*NL*
begged
pardon
for
having
displeased
her
.
In
a
softened
tone
she
declared
*NL*
herself
not
at
all
offended
;
but
he
continued
to
apologise
for
about
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
.

During
dinner
,
Mr.
Bennet
scarcely
spoke
at
all
;
but
when
the
servants
*NL*
were
withdrawn
,
he
thought
it
time
to
have
some
conversation
with
his
*NL*
guest
,
and
therefore
started
a
subject
in
which
he
expected
him
to
*NL*
shine
,
by
observing
that
he
seemed
very
fortunate
in
his
patroness
.
Lady
*NL*
Catherine
de
Bourgh
's
attention
to
his
wishes
,
and
consideration
for
*NL*
his
comfort
,
appeared
very
remarkable
.
Mr.
Bennet
could
not
have
chosen
*NL*
better
.
Mr.
Collins
was
eloquent
in
her
praise
.
The
subject
elevated
him
*NL*
to
more
than
usual
solemnity
of
manner
,
and
with
a
most
important
aspect
*NL*
he
protested
that
``
he
had
never
in
his
life
witnessed
such
behaviour
in
*NL*
a
person
of
rank
--
such
affability
and
condescension
,
as
he
had
himself
*NL*
experienced
from
Lady
Catherine
.
She
had
been
graciously
pleased
to
*NL*
approve
of
both
of
the
discourses
which
he
had
already
had
the
honour
of
*NL*
preaching
before
her
.
She
had
also
asked
him
twice
to
dine
at
Rosings
,
*NL*
and
had
sent
for
him
only
the
Saturday
before
,
to
make
up
her
pool
of
*NL*
quadrille
in
the
evening
.
Lady
Catherine
was
reckoned
proud
by
many
*NL*
people
he
knew
,
but
_
he
_
had
never
seen
anything
but
affability
in
her
.
*NL*
She
had
always
spoken
to
him
as
she
would
to
any
other
gentleman
;
she
*NL*
made
not
the
smallest
objection
to
his
joining
in
the
society
of
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
nor
to
his
leaving
the
parish
occasionally
for
a
week
or
*NL*
two
,
to
visit
his
relations
.
She
had
even
condescended
to
advise
him
to
*NL*
marry
as
soon
as
he
could
,
provided
he
chose
with
discretion
;
and
had
*NL*
once
paid
him
a
visit
in
his
humble
parsonage
,
where
she
had
perfectly
*NL*
approved
all
the
alterations
he
had
been
making
,
and
had
even
vouchsafed
*NL*
to
suggest
some
herself
--
some
shelves
in
the
closet
up
stairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
all
very
proper
and
civil
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bennet
,
``
and
*NL*
I
dare
say
she
is
a
very
agreeable
woman
.
It
is
a
pity
that
great
ladies
*NL*
in
general
are
not
more
like
her
.
Does
she
live
near
you
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
garden
in
which
stands
my
humble
abode
is
separated
only
by
a
lane
*NL*
from
Rosings
Park
,
her
ladyship
's
residence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
said
she
was
a
widow
,
sir
?
Has
she
any
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
only
one
daughter
,
the
heiress
of
Rosings
,
and
of
very
*NL*
extensive
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mrs.
Bennet
,
shaking
her
head
,
``
then
she
is
better
off
than
*NL*
many
girls
.
And
what
sort
of
young
lady
is
she
?
Is
she
handsome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
most
charming
young
lady
indeed
.
Lady
Catherine
herself
says
*NL*
that
,
in
point
of
true
beauty
,
Miss
de
Bourgh
is
far
superior
to
the
*NL*
handsomest
of
her
sex
,
because
there
is
that
in
her
features
which
marks
*NL*
the
young
lady
of
distinguished
birth
.
She
is
unfortunately
of
a
sickly
*NL*
constitution
,
which
has
prevented
her
from
making
that
progress
in
many
*NL*
accomplishments
which
she
could
not
have
otherwise
failed
of
,
as
I
am
*NL*
informed
by
the
lady
who
superintended
her
education
,
and
who
still
*NL*
resides
with
them
.
But
she
is
perfectly
amiable
,
and
often
condescends
*NL*
to
drive
by
my
humble
abode
in
her
little
phaeton
and
ponies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
been
presented
?
I
do
not
remember
her
name
among
the
ladies
at
*NL*
court
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
indifferent
state
of
health
unhappily
prevents
her
being
in
town
;
*NL*
and
by
that
means
,
as
I
told
Lady
Catherine
one
day
,
has
deprived
the
*NL*
British
court
of
its
brightest
ornament
.
Her
ladyship
seemed
pleased
*NL*
with
the
idea
;
and
you
may
imagine
that
I
am
happy
on
every
occasion
to
*NL*
offer
those
little
delicate
compliments
which
are
always
acceptable
*NL*
to
ladies
.
I
have
more
than
once
observed
to
Lady
Catherine
,
that
*NL*
her
charming
daughter
seemed
born
to
be
a
duchess
,
and
that
the
most
*NL*
elevated
rank
,
instead
of
giving
her
consequence
,
would
be
adorned
by
*NL*
her
.
These
are
the
kind
of
little
things
which
please
her
ladyship
,
and
*NL*
it
is
a
sort
of
attention
which
I
conceive
myself
peculiarly
bound
to
*NL*
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
judge
very
properly
,
''
said
Mr.
Bennet
,
``
and
it
is
happy
for
you
*NL*
that
you
possess
the
talent
of
flattering
with
delicacy
.
May
I
ask
*NL*
whether
these
pleasing
attentions
proceed
from
the
impulse
of
the
*NL*
moment
,
or
are
the
result
of
previous
study
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
arise
chiefly
from
what
is
passing
at
the
time
,
and
though
I
*NL*
sometimes
amuse
myself
with
suggesting
and
arranging
such
little
elegant
*NL*
compliments
as
may
be
adapted
to
ordinary
occasions
,
I
always
wish
to
*NL*
give
them
as
unstudied
an
air
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
's
expectations
were
fully
answered
.
His
cousin
was
as
absurd
*NL*
as
he
had
hoped
,
and
he
listened
to
him
with
the
keenest
enjoyment
,
*NL*
maintaining
at
the
same
time
the
most
resolute
composure
of
countenance
,
*NL*
and
,
except
in
an
occasional
glance
at
Elizabeth
,
requiring
no
partner
*NL*
in
his
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
tea-time
,
however
,
the
dose
had
been
enough
,
and
Mr.
Bennet
was
glad
*NL*
to
take
his
guest
into
the
drawing-room
again
,
and
,
when
tea
was
over
,
*NL*
glad
to
invite
him
to
read
aloud
to
the
ladies
.
Mr.
Collins
readily
*NL*
assented
,
and
a
book
was
produced
;
but
,
on
beholding
it
-LRB-
for
everything
*NL*
announced
it
to
be
from
a
circulating
library
-RRB-
,
he
started
back
,
and
*NL*
begging
pardon
,
protested
that
he
never
read
novels
.
Kitty
stared
at
*NL*
him
,
and
Lydia
exclaimed
.
Other
books
were
produced
,
and
after
some
*NL*
deliberation
he
chose
Fordyce
's
Sermons
.
Lydia
gaped
as
he
opened
the
*NL*
volume
,
and
before
he
had
,
with
very
monotonous
solemnity
,
read
three
*NL*
pages
,
she
interrupted
him
with
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
mamma
,
that
my
uncle
Phillips
talks
of
turning
away
*NL*
Richard
;
and
if
he
does
,
Colonel
Forster
will
hire
him
.
My
aunt
told
me
*NL*
so
herself
on
Saturday
.
I
shall
walk
to
Meryton
to-morrow
to
hear
more
*NL*
about
it
,
and
to
ask
when
Mr.
Denny
comes
back
from
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lydia
was
bid
by
her
two
eldest
sisters
to
hold
her
tongue
;
but
Mr.
*NL*
Collins
,
much
offended
,
laid
aside
his
book
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
often
observed
how
little
young
ladies
are
interested
by
books
*NL*
of
a
serious
stamp
,
though
written
solely
for
their
benefit
.
It
amazes
*NL*
me
,
I
confess
;
for
,
certainly
,
there
can
be
nothing
so
advantageous
to
*NL*
them
as
instruction
.
But
I
will
no
longer
importune
my
young
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
turning
to
Mr.
Bennet
,
he
offered
himself
as
his
antagonist
at
*NL*
backgammon
.
Mr.
Bennet
accepted
the
challenge
,
observing
that
he
acted
*NL*
very
wisely
in
leaving
the
girls
to
their
own
trifling
amusements
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
and
her
daughters
apologised
most
civilly
for
Lydia
's
*NL*
interruption
,
and
promised
that
it
should
not
occur
again
,
if
he
would
*NL*
resume
his
book
;
but
Mr.
Collins
,
after
assuring
them
that
he
bore
his
*NL*
young
cousin
no
ill-will
,
and
should
never
resent
her
behaviour
as
any
*NL*
affront
,
seated
himself
at
another
table
with
Mr.
Bennet
,
and
prepared
*NL*
for
backgammon
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
was
not
a
sensible
man
,
and
the
deficiency
of
nature
had
*NL*
been
but
little
assisted
by
education
or
society
;
the
greatest
part
*NL*
of
his
life
having
been
spent
under
the
guidance
of
an
illiterate
and
*NL*
miserly
father
;
and
though
he
belonged
to
one
of
the
universities
,
he
*NL*
had
merely
kept
the
necessary
terms
,
without
forming
at
it
any
useful
*NL*
acquaintance
.
The
subjection
in
which
his
father
had
brought
him
up
had
*NL*
given
him
originally
great
humility
of
manner
;
but
it
was
now
a
*NL*
good
deal
counteracted
by
the
self-conceit
of
a
weak
head
,
living
in
*NL*
retirement
,
and
the
consequential
feelings
of
early
and
unexpected
*NL*
prosperity
.
A
fortunate
chance
had
recommended
him
to
Lady
Catherine
de
*NL*
Bourgh
when
the
living
of
Hunsford
was
vacant
;
and
the
respect
which
*NL*
he
felt
for
her
high
rank
,
and
his
veneration
for
her
as
his
patroness
,
*NL*
mingling
with
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
,
of
his
authority
as
a
*NL*
clergyman
,
and
his
right
as
a
rector
,
made
him
altogether
a
mixture
of
*NL*
pride
and
obsequiousness
,
self-importance
and
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
now
a
good
house
and
a
very
sufficient
income
,
he
intended
to
*NL*
marry
;
and
in
seeking
a
reconciliation
with
the
Longbourn
family
he
had
*NL*
a
wife
in
view
,
as
he
meant
to
choose
one
of
the
daughters
,
if
he
found
*NL*
them
as
handsome
and
amiable
as
they
were
represented
by
common
report
.
*NL*
This
was
his
plan
of
amends
--
of
atonement
--
for
inheriting
their
father
's
*NL*
estate
;
and
he
thought
it
an
excellent
one
,
full
of
eligibility
and
*NL*
suitableness
,
and
excessively
generous
and
disinterested
on
his
own
*NL*
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
plan
did
not
vary
on
seeing
them
.
Miss
Bennet
's
lovely
face
*NL*
confirmed
his
views
,
and
established
all
his
strictest
notions
of
what
*NL*
was
due
to
seniority
;
and
for
the
first
evening
_
she
_
was
his
settled
*NL*
choice
.
The
next
morning
,
however
,
made
an
alteration
;
for
in
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
's
tete-a-tete
with
Mrs.
Bennet
before
breakfast
,
a
*NL*
conversation
beginning
with
his
parsonage-house
,
and
leading
naturally
*NL*
to
the
avowal
of
his
hopes
,
that
a
mistress
might
be
found
for
it
at
*NL*
Longbourn
,
produced
from
her
,
amid
very
complaisant
smiles
and
general
*NL*
encouragement
,
a
caution
against
the
very
Jane
he
had
fixed
on
.
``
As
to
*NL*
her
_
younger
_
daughters
,
she
could
not
take
upon
her
to
say
--
she
could
*NL*
not
positively
answer
--
but
she
did
not
_
know
_
of
any
prepossession
;
her
*NL*
_
eldest
_
daughter
,
she
must
just
mention
--
she
felt
it
incumbent
on
her
*NL*
to
hint
,
was
likely
to
be
very
soon
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
had
only
to
change
from
Jane
to
Elizabeth
--
and
it
was
soon
*NL*
done
--
done
while
Mrs.
Bennet
was
stirring
the
fire
.
Elizabeth
,
equally
*NL*
next
to
Jane
in
birth
and
beauty
,
succeeded
her
of
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
treasured
up
the
hint
,
and
trusted
that
she
might
soon
have
*NL*
two
daughters
married
;
and
the
man
whom
she
could
not
bear
to
speak
of
*NL*
the
day
before
was
now
high
in
her
good
graces
.

intention
of
walking
to
Meryton
was
not
forgotten
;
every
sister
*NL*
except
Mary
agreed
to
go
with
her
;
and
Mr.
Collins
was
to
attend
them
,
*NL*
at
the
request
of
Mr.
Bennet
,
who
was
most
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
,
*NL*
and
have
his
library
to
himself
;
for
thither
Mr.
Collins
had
followed
*NL*
him
after
breakfast
;
and
there
he
would
continue
,
nominally
engaged
with
*NL*
one
of
the
largest
folios
in
the
collection
,
but
really
talking
to
Mr.
*NL*
Bennet
,
with
little
cessation
,
of
his
house
and
garden
at
Hunsford
.
Such
*NL*
doings
discomposed
Mr.
Bennet
exceedingly
.
In
his
library
he
had
been
*NL*
always
sure
of
leisure
and
tranquillity
;
and
though
prepared
,
as
he
told
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
to
meet
with
folly
and
conceit
in
every
other
room
of
the
*NL*
house
,
he
was
used
to
be
free
from
them
there
;
his
civility
,
therefore
,
*NL*
was
most
prompt
in
inviting
Mr.
Collins
to
join
his
daughters
in
their
*NL*
walk
;
and
Mr.
Collins
,
being
in
fact
much
better
fitted
for
a
walker
*NL*
than
a
reader
,
was
extremely
pleased
to
close
his
large
book
,
and
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
pompous
nothings
on
his
side
,
and
civil
assents
on
that
of
his
*NL*
cousins
,
their
time
passed
till
they
entered
Meryton
.
The
attention
of
*NL*
the
younger
ones
was
then
no
longer
to
be
gained
by
him
.
Their
eyes
were
*NL*
immediately
wandering
up
in
the
street
in
quest
of
the
officers
,
and
*NL*
nothing
less
than
a
very
smart
bonnet
indeed
,
or
a
really
new
muslin
in
*NL*
a
shop
window
,
could
recall
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
attention
of
every
lady
was
soon
caught
by
a
young
man
,
whom
*NL*
they
had
never
seen
before
,
of
most
gentlemanlike
appearance
,
walking
*NL*
with
another
officer
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
.
The
officer
was
*NL*
the
very
Mr.
Denny
concerning
whose
return
from
London
Lydia
came
*NL*
to
inquire
,
and
he
bowed
as
they
passed
.
All
were
struck
with
the
*NL*
stranger
's
air
,
all
wondered
who
he
could
be
;
and
Kitty
and
Lydia
,
*NL*
determined
if
possible
to
find
out
,
led
the
way
across
the
street
,
under
*NL*
pretense
of
wanting
something
in
an
opposite
shop
,
and
fortunately
*NL*
had
just
gained
the
pavement
when
the
two
gentlemen
,
turning
back
,
had
*NL*
reached
the
same
spot
.
Mr.
Denny
addressed
them
directly
,
and
entreated
*NL*
permission
to
introduce
his
friend
,
Mr.
Wickham
,
who
had
returned
with
*NL*
him
the
day
before
from
town
,
and
he
was
happy
to
say
had
accepted
a
*NL*
commission
in
their
corps
.
This
was
exactly
as
it
should
be
;
for
the
*NL*
young
man
wanted
only
regimentals
to
make
him
completely
charming
.
*NL*
His
appearance
was
greatly
in
his
favour
;
he
had
all
the
best
part
of
*NL*
beauty
,
a
fine
countenance
,
a
good
figure
,
and
very
pleasing
address
.
*NL*
The
introduction
was
followed
up
on
his
side
by
a
happy
readiness
*NL*
of
conversation
--
a
readiness
at
the
same
time
perfectly
correct
and
*NL*
unassuming
;
and
the
whole
party
were
still
standing
and
talking
together
*NL*
very
agreeably
,
when
the
sound
of
horses
drew
their
notice
,
and
Darcy
*NL*
and
Bingley
were
seen
riding
down
the
street
.
On
distinguishing
the
*NL*
ladies
of
the
group
,
the
two
gentlemen
came
directly
towards
them
,
and
*NL*
began
the
usual
civilities
.
Bingley
was
the
principal
spokesman
,
and
*NL*
Miss
Bennet
the
principal
object
.
He
was
then
,
he
said
,
on
his
way
to
*NL*
Longbourn
on
purpose
to
inquire
after
her
.
Mr.
Darcy
corroborated
*NL*
it
with
a
bow
,
and
was
beginning
to
determine
not
to
fix
his
eyes
*NL*
on
Elizabeth
,
when
they
were
suddenly
arrested
by
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
stranger
,
and
Elizabeth
happening
to
see
the
countenance
of
both
as
they
*NL*
looked
at
each
other
,
was
all
astonishment
at
the
effect
of
the
meeting
.
*NL*
Both
changed
colour
,
one
looked
white
,
the
other
red
.
Mr.
Wickham
,
*NL*
after
a
few
moments
,
touched
his
hat
--
a
salutation
which
Mr.
Darcy
just
*NL*
deigned
to
return
.
What
could
be
the
meaning
of
it
?
It
was
impossible
to
*NL*
imagine
;
it
was
impossible
not
to
long
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
minute
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
but
without
seeming
to
have
noticed
what
*NL*
passed
,
took
leave
and
rode
on
with
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Denny
and
Mr.
Wickham
walked
with
the
young
ladies
to
the
door
of
*NL*
Mr.
Phillip
's
house
,
and
then
made
their
bows
,
in
spite
of
Miss
Lydia
's
*NL*
pressing
entreaties
that
they
should
come
in
,
and
even
in
spite
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Phillips
's
throwing
up
the
parlour
window
and
loudly
seconding
the
*NL*
invitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Phillips
was
always
glad
to
see
her
nieces
;
and
the
two
eldest
,
*NL*
from
their
recent
absence
,
were
particularly
welcome
,
and
she
was
*NL*
eagerly
expressing
her
surprise
at
their
sudden
return
home
,
which
,
as
*NL*
their
own
carriage
had
not
fetched
them
,
she
should
have
known
nothing
*NL*
about
,
if
she
had
not
happened
to
see
Mr.
Jones
's
shop-boy
in
the
*NL*
street
,
who
had
told
her
that
they
were
not
to
send
any
more
draughts
to
*NL*
Netherfield
because
the
Miss
Bennets
were
come
away
,
when
her
civility
*NL*
was
claimed
towards
Mr.
Collins
by
Jane
's
introduction
of
him
.
She
*NL*
received
him
with
her
very
best
politeness
,
which
he
returned
with
*NL*
as
much
more
,
apologising
for
his
intrusion
,
without
any
previous
*NL*
acquaintance
with
her
,
which
he
could
not
help
flattering
himself
,
*NL*
however
,
might
be
justified
by
his
relationship
to
the
young
ladies
who
*NL*
introduced
him
to
her
notice
.
Mrs.
Phillips
was
quite
awed
by
such
an
*NL*
excess
of
good
breeding
;
but
her
contemplation
of
one
stranger
was
soon
*NL*
put
to
an
end
by
exclamations
and
inquiries
about
the
other
;
of
whom
,
*NL*
however
,
she
could
only
tell
her
nieces
what
they
already
knew
,
that
*NL*
Mr.
Denny
had
brought
him
from
London
,
and
that
he
was
to
have
a
*NL*
lieutenant
's
commission
in
the
--
shire
.
She
had
been
watching
him
the
*NL*
last
hour
,
she
said
,
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
street
,
and
had
Mr.
*NL*
Wickham
appeared
,
Kitty
and
Lydia
would
certainly
have
continued
the
*NL*
occupation
,
but
unluckily
no
one
passed
windows
now
except
a
few
of
the
*NL*
officers
,
who
,
in
comparison
with
the
stranger
,
were
become
``
stupid
,
*NL*
disagreeable
fellows
.
''
Some
of
them
were
to
dine
with
the
Phillipses
*NL*
the
next
day
,
and
their
aunt
promised
to
make
her
husband
call
on
Mr.
*NL*
Wickham
,
and
give
him
an
invitation
also
,
if
the
family
from
Longbourn
*NL*
would
come
in
the
evening
.
This
was
agreed
to
,
and
Mrs.
Phillips
*NL*
protested
that
they
would
have
a
nice
comfortable
noisy
game
of
lottery
*NL*
tickets
,
and
a
little
bit
of
hot
supper
afterwards
.
The
prospect
of
such
*NL*
delights
was
very
cheering
,
and
they
parted
in
mutual
good
spirits
.
Mr.
*NL*
Collins
repeated
his
apologies
in
quitting
the
room
,
and
was
assured
*NL*
with
unwearying
civility
that
they
were
perfectly
needless
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
walked
home
,
Elizabeth
related
to
Jane
what
she
had
seen
pass
*NL*
between
the
two
gentlemen
;
but
though
Jane
would
have
defended
either
*NL*
or
both
,
had
they
appeared
to
be
in
the
wrong
,
she
could
no
more
explain
*NL*
such
behaviour
than
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
on
his
return
highly
gratified
Mrs.
Bennet
by
admiring
*NL*
Mrs.
Phillips
's
manners
and
politeness
.
He
protested
that
,
except
Lady
*NL*
Catherine
and
her
daughter
,
he
had
never
seen
a
more
elegant
woman
;
*NL*
for
she
had
not
only
received
him
with
the
utmost
civility
,
but
even
*NL*
pointedly
included
him
in
her
invitation
for
the
next
evening
,
although
*NL*
utterly
unknown
to
her
before
.
Something
,
he
supposed
,
might
be
*NL*
attributed
to
his
connection
with
them
,
but
yet
he
had
never
met
with
so
*NL*
much
attention
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
no
objection
was
made
to
the
young
people
's
engagement
with
their
*NL*
aunt
,
and
all
Mr.
Collins
's
scruples
of
leaving
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bennet
for
*NL*
a
single
evening
during
his
visit
were
most
steadily
resisted
,
the
coach
*NL*
conveyed
him
and
his
five
cousins
at
a
suitable
hour
to
Meryton
;
and
*NL*
the
girls
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
,
as
they
entered
the
drawing-room
,
*NL*
that
Mr.
Wickham
had
accepted
their
uncle
's
invitation
,
and
was
then
in
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
information
was
given
,
and
they
had
all
taken
their
seats
,
Mr.
*NL*
Collins
was
at
leisure
to
look
around
him
and
admire
,
and
he
was
so
much
*NL*
struck
with
the
size
and
furniture
of
the
apartment
,
that
he
declared
he
*NL*
might
almost
have
supposed
himself
in
the
small
summer
breakfast
*NL*
parlour
at
Rosings
;
a
comparison
that
did
not
at
first
convey
much
*NL*
gratification
;
but
when
Mrs.
Phillips
understood
from
him
what
*NL*
Rosings
was
,
and
who
was
its
proprietor
--
when
she
had
listened
to
the
*NL*
description
of
only
one
of
Lady
Catherine
's
drawing-rooms
,
and
found
*NL*
that
the
chimney-piece
alone
had
cost
eight
hundred
pounds
,
she
felt
all
*NL*
the
force
of
the
compliment
,
and
would
hardly
have
resented
a
comparison
*NL*
with
the
housekeeper
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
describing
to
her
all
the
grandeur
of
Lady
Catherine
and
her
mansion
,
*NL*
with
occasional
digressions
in
praise
of
his
own
humble
abode
,
and
*NL*
the
improvements
it
was
receiving
,
he
was
happily
employed
until
the
*NL*
gentlemen
joined
them
;
and
he
found
in
Mrs.
Phillips
a
very
attentive
*NL*
listener
,
whose
opinion
of
his
consequence
increased
with
what
she
*NL*
heard
,
and
who
was
resolving
to
retail
it
all
among
her
neighbours
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
could
.
To
the
girls
,
who
could
not
listen
to
their
cousin
,
*NL*
and
who
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
wish
for
an
instrument
,
and
examine
*NL*
their
own
indifferent
imitations
of
china
on
the
mantelpiece
,
the
*NL*
interval
of
waiting
appeared
very
long
.
It
was
over
at
last
,
however
.
*NL*
The
gentlemen
did
approach
,
and
when
Mr.
Wickham
walked
into
the
room
,
*NL*
Elizabeth
felt
that
she
had
neither
been
seeing
him
before
,
nor
thinking
*NL*
of
him
since
,
with
the
smallest
degree
of
unreasonable
admiration
.
*NL*
The
officers
of
the
--
shire
were
in
general
a
very
creditable
,
*NL*
gentlemanlike
set
,
and
the
best
of
them
were
of
the
present
party
;
but
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
was
as
far
beyond
them
all
in
person
,
countenance
,
air
,
and
*NL*
walk
,
as
_
they
_
were
superior
to
the
broad-faced
,
stuffy
uncle
Phillips
,
*NL*
breathing
port
wine
,
who
followed
them
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
was
the
happy
man
towards
whom
almost
every
female
eye
was
*NL*
turned
,
and
Elizabeth
was
the
happy
woman
by
whom
he
finally
seated
*NL*
himself
;
and
the
agreeable
manner
in
which
he
immediately
fell
into
*NL*
conversation
,
though
it
was
only
on
its
being
a
wet
night
,
made
her
feel
*NL*
that
the
commonest
,
dullest
,
most
threadbare
topic
might
be
rendered
*NL*
interesting
by
the
skill
of
the
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
rivals
for
the
notice
of
the
fair
as
Mr.
Wickham
and
the
*NL*
officers
,
Mr.
Collins
seemed
to
sink
into
insignificance
;
to
the
young
*NL*
ladies
he
certainly
was
nothing
;
but
he
had
still
at
intervals
a
kind
*NL*
listener
in
Mrs.
Phillips
,
and
was
by
her
watchfulness
,
most
abundantly
*NL*
supplied
with
coffee
and
muffin
.
When
the
card-tables
were
placed
,
he
*NL*
had
the
opportunity
of
obliging
her
in
turn
,
by
sitting
down
to
whist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
little
of
the
game
at
present
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
I
shall
be
glad
*NL*
to
improve
myself
,
for
in
my
situation
in
life
--
''
Mrs.
Phillips
was
very
*NL*
glad
for
his
compliance
,
but
could
not
wait
for
his
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
did
not
play
at
whist
,
and
with
ready
delight
was
he
*NL*
received
at
the
other
table
between
Elizabeth
and
Lydia
.
At
first
there
*NL*
seemed
danger
of
Lydia
's
engrossing
him
entirely
,
for
she
was
a
most
*NL*
determined
talker
;
but
being
likewise
extremely
fond
of
lottery
tickets
,
*NL*
she
soon
grew
too
much
interested
in
the
game
,
too
eager
in
making
bets
*NL*
and
exclaiming
after
prizes
to
have
attention
for
anyone
in
particular
.
*NL*
Allowing
for
the
common
demands
of
the
game
,
Mr.
Wickham
was
therefore
*NL*
at
leisure
to
talk
to
Elizabeth
,
and
she
was
very
willing
to
hear
*NL*
him
,
though
what
she
chiefly
wished
to
hear
she
could
not
hope
to
be
*NL*
told
--
the
history
of
his
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Darcy
.
She
dared
not
*NL*
even
mention
that
gentleman
.
Her
curiosity
,
however
,
was
unexpectedly
*NL*
relieved
.
Mr.
Wickham
began
the
subject
himself
.
He
inquired
how
far
*NL*
Netherfield
was
from
Meryton
;
and
,
after
receiving
her
answer
,
asked
in
*NL*
a
hesitating
manner
how
long
Mr.
Darcy
had
been
staying
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
a
month
,
''
said
Elizabeth
;
and
then
,
unwilling
to
let
the
subject
*NL*
drop
,
added
,
``
He
is
a
man
of
very
large
property
in
Derbyshire
,
I
*NL*
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Mr.
Wickham
;
``
his
estate
there
is
a
noble
one
.
A
clear
*NL*
ten
thousand
per
annum
.
You
could
not
have
met
with
a
person
more
*NL*
capable
of
giving
you
certain
information
on
that
head
than
myself
,
for
*NL*
I
have
been
connected
with
his
family
in
a
particular
manner
from
my
*NL*
infancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
not
but
look
surprised

``
You
may
well
be
surprised

Miss

at
such
an
assertion

after

seeing
,
as
you
probably
might
,
the
very
cold
manner
of
our
meeting

yesterday

Are
you
much
acquainted
with
Mr.
Darcy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
much
as
I
ever
wish
to
be

''
cried
Elizabeth
very
warmly
.
``
I
have
*NL*
spent
four
days
in
the
same
house
with
him
,
and
I
think
him
very
*NL*
disagreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
right
to
give
_
my

said
Wickham
,
``
as
to
his
being
*NL*
agreeable
or
otherwise
.
I
am
not
qualified
to
form
one

I
have
known
him
*NL*
too
long
and
too
well
to
be
a
fair
judge
.
It
is
impossible
for
_
me
_
*NL*
to
be
impartial
.
But
I
believe
your
opinion
of
him
would
in
general
*NL*
astonish
--
and
perhaps
you
would
not
express
it
quite
so
strongly
*NL*
anywhere
else
.
Here
you
are
in
your
own
family

*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word

I
say
no
more
_
here

than
I
might
say
in
any
house
in
*NL*
the
neighbourhood
,
except
Netherfield
.
He
is
not
at
all
liked
in
*NL*
Hertfordshire
.
Everybody
is
disgusted
with
his
pride
.
You
will
not
find
*NL*
him
more
favourably
spoken
of
by
anyone

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
pretend
to
be
sorry

said
Wickham
,
after
a
short
*NL*
interruption
,
``
that
he
or
that
any
man
should
not
be
estimated
beyond
*NL*
their
deserts
;
but
with
_
him
_
I
believe
it
does
not
often
happen
.
The
*NL*
world
is
blinded
by
his
fortune
and
consequence
,
or
frightened
by
his
*NL*
high
and
imposing
manners
,
and
sees
him
only
as
he
chooses
to
be
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
take
him
,
even
on
_
my
_
slight
acquaintance
,
to
be
an
*NL*
ill-tempered
man

''
Wickham
only
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
''
said
he
,
at
the
next
opportunity
of
speaking
,
``
whether
he
is
*NL*
likely
to
be
in
this
country
much
longer

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
at
all
know
;
but
I
_
heard
_
nothing
of
his
going
away
when
I
*NL*
was
at
Netherfield
.
I
hope
your
plans
in
favour
of
the
--
shire
will
*NL*
not
be
affected
by
his
being
in
the
neighbourhood

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
no
--
it
is
not
for
_
me
_
to
be
driven
away
by
Mr.
Darcy
.
If
_
he
_
*NL*
wishes
to
avoid
seeing
_
me
_
,
he
must
go
.
We
are
not
on
friendly
terms
,
*NL*
and
it
always
gives
me
pain
to
meet
him
,
but
I
have
no
reason
for
*NL*
avoiding
_
him

what
I
might
proclaim
before
all
the
world

a
sense
*NL*
of
very
great
ill-usage
,
and
most
painful
regrets
at
his
being
what
he
*NL*
is

His
father
,
Miss
Bennet
,
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
,
was
one
of
the
best
men
*NL*
that
ever
breathed
,
and
the
truest
friend
I
ever
had
;
and
I
can
never
*NL*
be
in
company
with
this
Mr.
Darcy
without
being
grieved
to
the
soul
by
*NL*
a
thousand
tender
recollections
.
His
behaviour
to
myself
has
been
*NL*
scandalous
;
but
I
verily
believe
I
could
forgive
him
anything
and
*NL*
everything
,
rather
than
his
disappointing
the
hopes
and
disgracing
the
*NL*
memory
of
his
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
found
the
interest
of
the
subject
increase
,
and
listened
with
*NL*
all
her
heart
;
but
the
delicacy
of
it
prevented
further
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
began
to
speak
on
more
general
topics
,
Meryton
,
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
the
society
,
appearing
highly
pleased
with
all
that
*NL*
he
had
yet
seen
,
and
speaking
of
the
latter
with
gentle
but
very
*NL*
intelligible
gallantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
prospect
of
constant
society
,
and
good
society
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
``
which
was
my
chief
inducement
to
enter
the
--
shire
.
I
knew
it
to
be
*NL*
a
most
respectable
,
agreeable
corps
,
and
my
friend
Denny
tempted
me
*NL*
further
by
his
account
of
their
present
quarters
,
and
the
very
great
*NL*
attentions
and
excellent
acquaintances
Meryton
had
procured
them
.
*NL*
Society
,
I
own
,
is
necessary
to
me
.
I
have
been
a
disappointed
man
,
and
*NL*
my
spirits
will
not
bear
solitude
.
I
_
must
_
have
employment
and
society
.
*NL*
A
military
life
is
not
what
I
was
intended
for
,
but
circumstances
have
*NL*
now
made
it
eligible
.
The
church
_
ought
_
to
have
been
my
profession
--
I
*NL*
was
brought
up
for
the
church
,
and
I
should
at
this
time
have
been
in
*NL*
possession
of
a
most
valuable
living

it
pleased
the
gentleman
we
*NL*
were
speaking
of
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
bequeathed
me
the
next
presentation
of
the
best
*NL*
living
in
his
gift
.
He
was
my
godfather
,
and
excessively
attached
to
me
.
*NL*
I
can
not
do
justice
to
his
kindness
.
He
meant
to
provide
for
me
amply
,
*NL*
and
thought
he
had
done
it
;
but
when
the
living
fell
,
it
was
given
*NL*
elsewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
cried
Elizabeth
;
``
but
how
could
_
that
_
be
?
How
could
his
*NL*
will
be
disregarded
?
Why
did
you
not
seek
legal
redress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
just
such
an
informality
in
the
terms
of
the
bequest
as
to
*NL*
give
me
no
hope
from
law
.
A
man
of
honour
could
not
have
doubted
the
*NL*
intention
,
but
Mr.
Darcy
chose
to
doubt
it
--
or
to
treat
it
as
a
merely
*NL*
conditional
recommendation
,
and
to
assert
that
I
had
forfeited
all
claim
*NL*
to
it
by
extravagance
,
imprudence
--
in
short
anything
or
nothing
.
Certain
*NL*
it
is
,
that
the
living
became
vacant
two
years
ago
,
exactly
as
I
was
*NL*
of
an
age
to
hold
it
,
and
that
it
was
given
to
another
man
;
and
no
*NL*
less
certain
is
it
,
that
I
can
not
accuse
myself
of
having
really
done
*NL*
anything
to
deserve
to
lose
it
.
I
have
a
warm
,
unguarded
temper
,
and
*NL*
I
may
have
spoken
my
opinion
_
of
_
him
,
and
_
to
_
him
,
too
freely
.
I
can
*NL*
recall
nothing
worse
.
But
the
fact
is
,
that
we
are
very
different
sort
*NL*
of
men
,
and
that
he
hates
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
quite
shocking
!
He
deserves
to
be
publicly
disgraced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
time
or
other
he
_
will
_
be
--
but
it
shall
not
be
by
_
me
_
.
Till
I
*NL*
can
forget
his
father
,
I
can
never
defy
or
expose
_
him
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
honoured
him
for
such
feelings
,
and
thought
him
handsomer
than
*NL*
ever
as
he
expressed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
,
''
said
she
,
after
a
pause
,
``
can
have
been
his
motive
?
What
can
*NL*
have
induced
him
to
behave
so
cruelly
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
thorough
,
determined
dislike
of
me
--
a
dislike
which
I
can
not
but
*NL*
attribute
in
some
measure
to
jealousy
.
Had
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
liked
me
*NL*
less
,
his
son
might
have
borne
with
me
better
;
but
his
father
's
uncommon
*NL*
attachment
to
me
irritated
him
,
I
believe
,
very
early
in
life
.
He
had
*NL*
not
a
temper
to
bear
the
sort
of
competition
in
which
we
stood
--
the
sort
*NL*
of
preference
which
was
often
given
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
thought
Mr.
Darcy
so
bad
as
this

though
I
have
never
liked
*NL*
him
.
I
had
not
thought
so
very
ill
of
him
.
I
had
supposed
him
to
be
*NL*
despising
his
fellow-creatures
in
general
,
but
did
not
suspect
him
of
*NL*
descending
to
such
malicious
revenge
,
such
injustice
,
such
inhumanity
as
*NL*
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
minutes
'
reflection
,
however
,
she
continued
,
``
I
_
do
_
*NL*
remember
his
boasting
one
day

at
Netherfield

of
the
implacability
of

his
resentments

of
his
having
an
unforgiving
temper

must
be
dreadful

*NL*
``
I
will
not
trust
myself

Wickham
;

I
can
hardly

be
just
to
him

*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
again
deep
in
thought
,
and
after
a
time
exclaimed
,
``
To

treat
in
such
a
manner

godson

countenance

vouch

she
contented
herself

with
,
``

one

too

who
had
probably
been
his
companion
from
childhood

*NL*
connected
together

I
think
you
said
,
in
the
closest
manner
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
born
in
the
same
parish
,
within
the
same
park
;
the
greatest
*NL*
part
of
our
youth
was
passed
together
;
inmates
of
the
same
house

*NL*
sharing
the

amusements

objects

parental
care

_
My

*NL*
father
began
life
in
the
profession
which
your
uncle

Mr.

,
*NL*
appears
to
do
so
much
credit
to

he
gave
up
everything

use

the
late
Mr.

devoted
all
his
time

He
was
most
highly
esteemed

intimate

often
acknowledged

active
superintendence

when

immediately

gave
him
a

voluntary
promise

providing

am
convinced

felt
it

much
a
debt

gratitude

him

nearer
with
virtue

with
any

But
we
are

none

in
his

there
were
stronger

impulses

``
Can
such
abominable
pride

good

Yes

freely

display
hospitality

to
assist

with

up

she

Phillips
began
to
express
her
concern
thereupon
,
*NL*
he
assured
her
with
much
earnest
gravity
that
it
was
not
of
the
least
*NL*
importance
,
that
he
considered
the
money
as
a
mere
trifle
,
and
begged
*NL*
that
she
would
not
make
herself
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
very
well
,
madam
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
when
persons
sit
down
to
a
*NL*
card-table
,
they
must
take
their
chances
of
these
things
,
and
happily
I
*NL*
am
not
in
such
circumstances
as
to
make
five
shillings
any
object
.
There
*NL*
are
undoubtedly
many
who
could
not
say
the
same
,
but
thanks
to
Lady
*NL*
Catherine
de
Bourgh
,
I
am
removed
far
beyond
the
necessity
of
regarding
*NL*
little
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
's
attention
was
caught
;
and
after
observing
Mr.
Collins
for
*NL*
a
few
moments
,
he
asked
Elizabeth
in
a
low
voice
whether
her
relation
*NL*
was
very
intimately
acquainted
with
the
family
of
de
Bourgh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
,
''
she
replied
,
``
has
very
lately
given
him
*NL*
a
living
.
I
hardly
know
how
Mr.
Collins
was
first
introduced
to
her
*NL*
notice
,
but
he
certainly
has
not
known
her
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
of
course
that
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
and
Lady
Anne
Darcy
*NL*
were
sisters
;
consequently
that
she
is
aunt
to
the
present
Mr.
Darcy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
I
did
not
.
I
knew
nothing
at
all
of
Lady
Catherine
's
*NL*
connections
.
I
never
heard
of
her
existence
till
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
daughter
,
Miss
de
Bourgh
,
will
have
a
very
large
fortune
,
and
it
is
*NL*
believed
that
she
and
her
cousin
will
unite
the
two
estates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
information
made
Elizabeth
smile
,
as
she
thought
of
poor
Miss
*NL*
Bingley
.
Vain
indeed
must
be
all
her
attentions
,
vain
and
useless
her
*NL*
affection
for
his
sister
and
her
praise
of
himself
,
if
he
were
already
*NL*
self-destined
for
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Collins
,
''
said
she
,
``
speaks
highly
both
of
Lady
Catherine
and
her
*NL*
daughter
;
but
from
some
particulars
that
he
has
related
of
her
ladyship
,
*NL*
I
suspect
his
gratitude
misleads
him
,
and
that
in
spite
of
her
being
his
*NL*
patroness
,
she
is
an
arrogant
,
conceited
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
her
to
be
both
in
a
great
degree
,
''
replied
Wickham
;
``
I
have
*NL*
not
seen
her
for
many
years
,
but
I
very
well
remember
that
I
never
liked
*NL*
her
,
and
that
her
manners
were
dictatorial
and
insolent
.
She
has
the
*NL*
reputation
of
being
remarkably
sensible
and
clever
;
but
I
rather
believe
*NL*
she
derives
part
of
her
abilities
from
her
rank
and
fortune
,
part
from
*NL*
her
authoritative
manner
,
and
the
rest
from
the
pride
for
her
*NL*
nephew
,
who
chooses
that
everyone
connected
with
him
should
have
an
*NL*
understanding
of
the
first
class
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
allowed
that
he
had
given
a
very
rational
account
of
it
,
and
*NL*
they
continued
talking
together
,
with
mutual
satisfaction
till
supper
*NL*
put
an
end
to
cards
,
and
gave
the
rest
of
the
ladies
their
share
of
Mr.
*NL*
Wickham
's
attentions
.
There
could
be
no
conversation
in
the
noise
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Phillips
's
supper
party
,
but
his
manners
recommended
him
to
*NL*
everybody
.
Whatever
he
said
,
was
said
well
;
and
whatever
he
did
,
done
*NL*
gracefully
.
Elizabeth
went
away
with
her
head
full
of
him
.
She
could
*NL*
think
of
nothing
but
of
Mr.
Wickham
,
and
of
what
he
had
told
her
,
all
*NL*
the
way
home
;
but
there
was
not
time
for
her
even
to
mention
his
name
*NL*
as
they
went
,
for
neither
Lydia
nor
Mr.
Collins
were
once
silent
.
Lydia
*NL*
talked
incessantly
of
lottery
tickets
,
of
the
fish
she
had
lost
and
the
*NL*
fish
she
had
won
;
and
Mr.
Collins
in
describing
the
civility
of
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Phillips
,
protesting
that
he
did
not
in
the
least
regard
his
losses
*NL*
at
whist
,
enumerating
all
the
dishes
at
supper
,
and
repeatedly
fearing
*NL*
that
he
crowded
his
cousins
,
had
more
to
say
than
he
could
well
manage
*NL*
before
the
carriage
stopped
at
Longbourn
House
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
related
to
Jane
the
next
day
what
had
passed
between
Mr.
*NL*
Wickham
and
herself
.
Jane
listened
with
astonishment
and
concern
;
she
*NL*
knew
not
how
to
believe
that
Mr.
Darcy
could
be
so
unworthy
of
Mr.
*NL*
Bingley
's
regard
;
and
yet
,
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
question
the
*NL*
veracity
of
a
young
man
of
such
amiable
appearance
as
Wickham
.
The
*NL*
possibility
of
his
having
endured
such
unkindness
,
was
enough
to
*NL*
interest
all
her
tender
feelings
;
and
nothing
remained
therefore
to
be
*NL*
done
,
but
to
think
well
of
them
both
,
to
defend
the
conduct
of
each
,
*NL*
and
throw
into
the
account
of
accident
or
mistake
whatever
could
not
be
*NL*
otherwise
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
both
,
''
said
she
,
``
been
deceived
,
I
dare
say
,
in
some
way
*NL*
or
other
,
of
which
we
can
form
no
idea
.
Interested
people
have
perhaps
*NL*
misrepresented
each
to
the
other
.
It
is
,
in
short
,
impossible
for
us
to
*NL*
conjecture
the
causes
or
circumstances
which
may
have
alienated
them
,
*NL*
without
actual
blame
on
either
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
indeed
;
and
now
,
my
dear
Jane
,
what
have
you
got
to
say
on
*NL*
behalf
of
the
interested
people
who
have
probably
been
concerned
in
the
*NL*
business
?
Do
clear
_
them
_
too
,
or
we
shall
be
obliged
to
think
ill
of
*NL*
somebody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laugh
as
much
as
you
choose
,
but
you
will
not
laugh
me
out
of
my
*NL*
opinion
.
My
dearest
Lizzy
,
do
but
consider
in
what
a
disgraceful
light
*NL*
it
places
Mr.
Darcy
,
to
be
treating
his
father
's
favourite
in
such
*NL*
a
manner
,
one
whom
his
father
had
promised
to
provide
for
.
It
is
*NL*
impossible
.
No
man
of
common
humanity
,
no
man
who
had
any
value
for
his
*NL*
character
,
could
be
capable
of
it
.
Can
his
most
intimate
friends
be
so
*NL*
excessively
deceived
in
him
?
Oh
!
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
much
more
easily
believe
Mr.
Bingley
's
being
imposed
on
,
than
*NL*
that
Mr.
Wickham
should
invent
such
a
history
of
himself
as
he
gave
me
*NL*
last
night
;
names
,
facts
,
everything
mentioned
without
ceremony
.
If
it
*NL*
be
not
so
,
let
Mr.
Darcy
contradict
it
.
Besides
,
there
was
truth
in
his
*NL*
looks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
difficult
indeed
--
it
is
distressing
.
One
does
not
know
what
to
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
;
one
knows
exactly
what
to
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jane
could
think
with
certainty
on
only
one
point
--
that
Mr.
Bingley
,
*NL*
if
he
_
had
_
been
imposed
on
,
would
have
much
to
suffer
when
the
affair
*NL*
became
public
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
young
ladies
were
summoned
from
the
shrubbery
,
where
this
*NL*
conversation
passed
,
by
the
arrival
of
the
very
persons
of
whom
they
had
*NL*
been
speaking
;
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sisters
came
to
give
their
personal
*NL*
invitation
for
the
long-expected
ball
at
Netherfield
,
which
was
fixed
*NL*
for
the
following
Tuesday
.
The
two
ladies
were
delighted
to
see
their
*NL*
dear
friend
again
,
called
it
an
age
since
they
had
met
,
and
repeatedly
*NL*
asked
what
she
had
been
doing
with
herself
since
their
separation
.
To
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
family
they
paid
little
attention
;
avoiding
Mrs.
Bennet
*NL*
as
much
as
possible
,
saying
not
much
to
Elizabeth
,
and
nothing
at
all
to
*NL*
the
others
.
They
were
soon
gone
again
,
rising
from
their
seats
with
an
*NL*
activity
which
took
their
brother
by
surprise
,
and
hurrying
off
as
if
*NL*
eager
to
escape
from
Mrs.
Bennet
's
civilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prospect
of
the
Netherfield
ball
was
extremely
agreeable
to
every
*NL*
female
of
the
family
.
Mrs.
Bennet
chose
to
consider
it
as
given
in
*NL*
compliment
to
her
eldest
daughter
,
and
was
particularly
flattered
*NL*
by
receiving
the
invitation
from
Mr.
Bingley
himself
,
instead
of
a
*NL*
ceremonious
card
.
Jane
pictured
to
herself
a
happy
evening
in
the
*NL*
society
of
her
two
friends
,
and
the
attentions
of
their
brother
;
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
thought
with
pleasure
of
dancing
a
great
deal
with
Mr.
*NL*
Wickham
,
and
of
seeing
a
confirmation
of
everything
in
Mr.
Darcy
's
look
*NL*
and
behaviour
.
The
happiness
anticipated
by
Catherine
and
Lydia
depended
*NL*
less
on
any
single
event
,
or
any
particular
person
,
for
though
they
*NL*
each
,
like
Elizabeth
,
meant
to
dance
half
the
evening
with
Mr.
Wickham
,
*NL*
he
was
by
no
means
the
only
partner
who
could
satisfy
them
,
and
a
ball
*NL*
was
,
at
any
rate
,
a
ball
.
And
even
Mary
could
assure
her
family
that
she
*NL*
had
no
disinclination
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
I
can
have
my
mornings
to
myself
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
is
enough
--
I
*NL*
think
it
is
no
sacrifice
to
join
occasionally
in
evening
engagements
.
*NL*
Society
has
claims
on
us
all
;
and
I
profess
myself
one
of
those
*NL*
who
consider
intervals
of
recreation
and
amusement
as
desirable
for
*NL*
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
spirits
were
so
high
on
this
occasion
,
that
though
she
did
*NL*
not
often
speak
unnecessarily
to
Mr.
Collins
,
she
could
not
help
asking
*NL*
him
whether
he
intended
to
accept
Mr.
Bingley
's
invitation
,
and
if
*NL*
he
did
,
whether
he
would
think
it
proper
to
join
in
the
evening
's
*NL*
amusement
;
and
she
was
rather
surprised
to
find
that
he
entertained
no
*NL*
scruple
whatever
on
that
head
,
and
was
very
far
from
dreading
a
rebuke
*NL*
either
from
the
Archbishop
,
or
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
,
by
venturing
to
*NL*
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
by
no
means
of
the
opinion
,
I
assure
you
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
a
ball
*NL*
of
this
kind
,
given
by
a
young
man
of
character
,
to
respectable
people
,
*NL*
can
have
any
evil
tendency
;
and
I
am
so
far
from
objecting
to
dancing
*NL*
myself
,
that
I
shall
hope
to
be
honoured
with
the
hands
of
all
my
fair
*NL*
cousins
in
the
course
of
the
evening
;
and
I
take
this
opportunity
of
*NL*
soliciting
yours
,
Miss
Elizabeth
,
for
the
two
first
dances
especially
,
*NL*
a
preference
which
I
trust
my
cousin
Jane
will
attribute
to
the
right
*NL*
cause
,
and
not
to
any
disrespect
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
felt
herself
completely
taken
in
.
She
had
fully
proposed
being
*NL*
engaged
by
Mr.
Wickham
for
those
very
dances
;
and
to
have
Mr.
Collins
*NL*
instead
!
her
liveliness
had
never
been
worse
timed
.
There
was
no
help
*NL*
for
it
,
however
.
Mr.
Wickham
's
happiness
and
her
own
were
perforce
*NL*
delayed
a
little
longer
,
and
Mr.
Collins
's
proposal
accepted
with
as
*NL*
good
a
grace
as
she
could
.
She
was
not
the
better
pleased
with
his
*NL*
gallantry
from
the
idea
it
suggested
of
something
more
.
It
now
first
*NL*
struck
her
,
that
_
she
_
was
selected
from
among
her
sisters
as
worthy
*NL*
of
being
mistress
of
Hunsford
Parsonage
,
and
of
assisting
to
form
a
*NL*
quadrille
table
at
Rosings
,
in
the
absence
of
more
eligible
visitors
.
*NL*
The
idea
soon
reached
to
conviction
,
as
she
observed
his
increasing
*NL*
civilities
toward
herself
,
and
heard
his
frequent
attempt
at
a
*NL*
compliment
on
her
wit
and
vivacity
;
and
though
more
astonished
than
*NL*
gratified
herself
by
this
effect
of
her
charms
,
it
was
not
long
before
*NL*
her
mother
gave
her
to
understand
that
the
probability
of
their
marriage
*NL*
was
extremely
agreeable
to
_
her
_
.
Elizabeth
,
however
,
did
not
choose
*NL*
to
take
the
hint
,
being
well
aware
that
a
serious
dispute
must
be
the
*NL*
consequence
of
any
reply
.
Mr.
Collins
might
never
make
the
offer
,
and
*NL*
till
he
did
,
it
was
useless
to
quarrel
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
there
had
not
been
a
Netherfield
ball
to
prepare
for
and
talk
of
,
the
*NL*
younger
Miss
Bennets
would
have
been
in
a
very
pitiable
state
at
this
*NL*
time
,
for
from
the
day
of
the
invitation
,
to
the
day
of
the
ball
,
there
*NL*
was
such
a
succession
of
rain
as
prevented
their
walking
to
Meryton
*NL*
once
.
No
aunt
,
no
officers
,
no
news
could
be
sought
after
--
the
very
*NL*
shoe-roses
for
Netherfield
were
got
by
proxy
.
Even
Elizabeth
might
have
*NL*
found
some
trial
of
her
patience
in
weather
which
totally
suspended
the
*NL*
improvement
of
her
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Wickham
;
and
nothing
less
than
*NL*
a
dance
on
Tuesday
,
could
have
made
such
a
Friday
,
Saturday
,
Sunday
,
and
*NL*
Monday
endurable
to
Kitty
and
Lydia
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
18
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Till
Elizabeth
entered
the
drawing-room
at
Netherfield
,
and
looked
in
*NL*
vain
for
Mr.
Wickham
among
the
cluster
of
red
coats
there
assembled
,
a
*NL*
doubt
of
his
being
present
had
never
occurred
to
her
.
The
certainty
*NL*
of
meeting
him
had
not
been
checked
by
any
of
those
recollections
that
*NL*
might
not
unreasonably
have
alarmed
her
.
She
had
dressed
with
more
than
*NL*
usual
care
,
and
prepared
in
the
highest
spirits
for
the
conquest
of
all
*NL*
that
remained
unsubdued
of
his
heart
,
trusting
that
it
was
not
more
than
*NL*
might
be
won
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
But
in
an
instant
arose
*NL*
the
dreadful
suspicion
of
his
being
purposely
omitted
for
Mr.
Darcy
's
*NL*
pleasure
in
the
Bingleys
'
invitation
to
the
officers
;
and
though
*NL*
this
was
not
exactly
the
case
,
the
absolute
fact
of
his
absence
was
*NL*
pronounced
by
his
friend
Denny
,
to
whom
Lydia
eagerly
applied
,
and
who
*NL*
told
them
that
Wickham
had
been
obliged
to
go
to
town
on
business
the
*NL*
day
before
,
and
was
not
yet
returned
;
adding
,
with
a
significant
smile
,
*NL*
``
I
do
not
imagine
his
business
would
have
called
him
away
just
now
,
if
*NL*
he
had
not
wanted
to
avoid
a
certain
gentleman
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
part
of
his
intelligence
,
though
unheard
by
Lydia
,
was
caught
by
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
and
,
as
it
assured
her
that
Darcy
was
not
less
answerable
for
*NL*
Wickham
's
absence
than
if
her
first
surmise
had
been
just
,
every
*NL*
feeling
of
displeasure
against
the
former
was
so
sharpened
by
immediate
*NL*
disappointment
,
that
she
could
hardly
reply
with
tolerable
civility
to
*NL*
the
polite
inquiries
which
he
directly
afterwards
approached
to
make
.
*NL*
Attendance
,
forbearance
,
patience
with
Darcy
,
was
injury
to
Wickham
.
She
*NL*
was
resolved
against
any
sort
of
conversation
with
him
,
and
turned
away
*NL*
with
a
degree
of
ill-humour
which
she
could
not
wholly
surmount
even
in
*NL*
speaking
to
Mr.
Bingley
,
whose
blind
partiality
provoked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Elizabeth
was
not
formed
for
ill-humour
;
and
though
every
prospect
*NL*
of
her
own
was
destroyed
for
the
evening
,
it
could
not
dwell
long
on
her
*NL*
spirits
;
and
having
told
all
her
griefs
to
Charlotte
Lucas
,
whom
she
had
*NL*
not
seen
for
a
week
,
she
was
soon
able
to
make
a
voluntary
transition
*NL*
to
the
oddities
of
her
cousin
,
and
to
point
him
out
to
her
particular
*NL*
notice
.
The
first
two
dances
,
however
,
brought
a
return
of
distress
;
*NL*
they
were
dances
of
mortification
.
Mr.
Collins
,
awkward
and
solemn
,
*NL*
apologising
instead
of
attending
,
and
often
moving
wrong
without
being
*NL*
aware
of
it
,
gave
her
all
the
shame
and
misery
which
a
disagreeable
*NL*
partner
for
a
couple
of
dances
can
give
.
The
moment
of
her
release
from
*NL*
him
was
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
danced
next
with
an
officer
,
and
had
the
refreshment
of
talking
of
*NL*
Wickham
,
and
of
hearing
that
he
was
universally
liked
.
When
those
dances
*NL*
were
over
,
she
returned
to
Charlotte
Lucas
,
and
was
in
conversation
with
*NL*
her
,
when
she
found
herself
suddenly
addressed
by
Mr.
Darcy
who
took
*NL*
her
so
much
by
surprise
in
his
application
for
her
hand
,
that
,
*NL*
without
knowing
what
she
did
,
she
accepted
him
.
He
walked
away
again
*NL*
immediately
,
and
she
was
left
to
fret
over
her
own
want
of
presence
of
*NL*
mind
;
Charlotte
tried
to
console
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
you
will
find
him
very
agreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forbid
!
_
That
_
would
be
the
greatest
misfortune
of
all
!
To
find
*NL*
a
man
agreeable
whom
one
is
determined
to
hate
!
Do
not
wish
me
such
an
*NL*
evil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
dancing
recommenced
,
however
,
and
Darcy
approached
to
claim
her
*NL*
hand
,
Charlotte
could
not
help
cautioning
her
in
a
whisper
,
not
to
be
a
*NL*
simpleton
,
and
allow
her
fancy
for
Wickham
to
make
her
appear
unpleasant
*NL*
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
ten
times
his
consequence
.
Elizabeth
made
no
*NL*
answer
,
and
took
her
place
in
the
set
,
amazed
at
the
dignity
to
which
*NL*
she
was
arrived
in
being
allowed
to
stand
opposite
to
Mr.
Darcy
,
and
*NL*
reading
in
her
neighbours
'
looks
,
their
equal
amazement
in
beholding
*NL*
it
.
They
stood
for
some
time
without
speaking
a
word
;
and
she
began
to
*NL*
imagine
that
their
silence
was
to
last
through
the
two
dances
,
and
at
*NL*
first
was
resolved
not
to
break
it
;
till
suddenly
fancying
that
it
would
*NL*
be
the
greater
punishment
to
her
partner
to
oblige
him
to
talk
,
she
made
*NL*
some
slight
observation
on
the
dance
.
He
replied
,
and
was
again
*NL*
silent
.
After
a
pause
of
some
minutes
,
she
addressed
him
a
second
time
*NL*
with
:
--
``
It
is
_
your
_
turn
to
say
something
now
,
Mr.
Darcy
.
I
talked
*NL*
about
the
dance
,
and
_
you
_
ought
to
make
some
sort
of
remark
on
the
size
*NL*
of
the
room
,
or
the
number
of
couples
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
,
and
assured
her
that
whatever
she
wished
him
to
say
should
be
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
That
reply
will
do
for
the
present
.
Perhaps
by
and
by
I
may
*NL*
observe
that
private
balls
are
much
pleasanter
than
public
ones
.
But
*NL*
_
now
_
we
may
be
silent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
talk
by
rule
,
then
,
while
you
are
dancing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
.
One
must
speak
a
little
,
you
know
.
It
would
look
odd
to
be
*NL*
entirely
silent
for
half
an
hour
together
;
and
yet
for
the
advantage
of
*NL*
_
some
_
,
conversation
ought
to
be
so
arranged
,
as
that
they
may
have
the
*NL*
trouble
of
saying
as
little
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
consulting
your
own
feelings
in
the
present
case
,
or
do
you
*NL*
imagine
that
you
are
gratifying
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
archly
;
``
for
I
have
always
seen
a
great
*NL*
similarity
in
the
turn
of
our
minds
.
We
are
each
of
an
unsocial
,
*NL*
taciturn
disposition
,
unwilling
to
speak
,
unless
we
expect
to
say
*NL*
something
that
will
amaze
the
whole
room
,
and
be
handed
down
to
*NL*
posterity
with
all
the
eclat
of
a
proverb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
no
very
striking
resemblance
of
your
own
character
,
I
am
sure
,
''
*NL*
said
he
.
``
How
near
it
may
be
to
_
mine
_
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
say
.
_
You
_
*NL*
think
it
a
faithful
portrait
undoubtedly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
not
decide
on
my
own
performance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
answer
,
and
they
were
again
silent
till
they
had
gone
down
*NL*
the
dance
,
when
he
asked
her
if
she
and
her
sisters
did
not
very
often
*NL*
walk
to
Meryton
.
She
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
and
,
unable
to
resist
*NL*
the
temptation
,
added
,
``
When
you
met
us
there
the
other
day
,
we
had
just
*NL*
been
forming
a
new
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
was
immediate
.
A
deeper
shade
of
_
hauteur
_
overspread
his
*NL*
features
,
but
he
said
not
a
word
,
and
Elizabeth
,
though
blaming
herself
*NL*
for
her
own
weakness
,
could
not
go
on
.
At
length
Darcy
spoke
,
and
in
a
*NL*
constrained
manner
said
,
``
Mr.
Wickham
is
blessed
with
such
happy
manners
*NL*
as
may
ensure
his
_
making
_
friends
--
whether
he
may
be
equally
capable
of
*NL*
_
retaining
_
them
,
is
less
certain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
so
unlucky
as
to
lose
_
your
_
friendship
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
*NL*
with
emphasis
,
``
and
in
a
manner
which
he
is
likely
to
suffer
from
all
*NL*
his
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darcy
made
no
answer
,
and
seemed
desirous
of
changing
the
subject
.
At
*NL*
that
moment
,
Sir
William
Lucas
appeared
close
to
them
,
meaning
to
pass
*NL*
through
the
set
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
;
but
on
perceiving
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
,
he
stopped
with
a
bow
of
superior
courtesy
to
compliment
him
on
*NL*
his
dancing
and
his
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
most
highly
gratified
indeed
,
my
dear
sir
.
Such
very
*NL*
superior
dancing
is
not
often
seen
.
It
is
evident
that
you
belong
to
the
*NL*
first
circles
.
Allow
me
to
say
,
however
,
that
your
fair
partner
does
not
*NL*
disgrace
you
,
and
that
I
must
hope
to
have
this
pleasure
often
repeated
,
*NL*
especially
when
a
certain
desirable
event
,
my
dear
Eliza
-LRB-
glancing
at
*NL*
her
sister
and
Bingley
-RRB-
shall
take
place
.
What
congratulations
will
then
*NL*
flow
in
!
I
appeal
to
Mr.
Darcy
:
--
but
let
me
not
interrupt
you
,
sir
.
You
*NL*
will
not
thank
me
for
detaining
you
from
the
bewitching
converse
of
that
*NL*
young
lady
,
whose
bright
eyes
are
also
upbraiding
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
part
of
this
address
was
scarcely
heard
by
Darcy
;
but
Sir
*NL*
William
's
allusion
to
his
friend
seemed
to
strike
him
forcibly
,
and
his
*NL*
eyes
were
directed
with
a
very
serious
expression
towards
Bingley
and
*NL*
Jane
,
who
were
dancing
together
.
Recovering
himself
,
however
,
shortly
,
*NL*
he
turned
to
his
partner
,
and
said
,
``
Sir
William
's
interruption
has
made
*NL*
me
forget
what
we
were
talking
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
we
were
speaking
at
all
.
Sir
William
could
not
have
*NL*
interrupted
two
people
in
the
room
who
had
less
to
say
for
themselves
.
*NL*
We
have
tried
two
or
three
subjects
already
without
success
,
and
what
we
*NL*
are
to
talk
of
next
I
can
not
imagine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
think
you
of
books
?
''
said
he
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Books
--
oh
!
no
.
I
am
sure
we
never
read
the
same
,
or
not
with
the
same
*NL*
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
you
think
so
;
but
if
that
be
the
case
,
there
can
at
least
be
*NL*
no
want
of
subject
.
We
may
compare
our
different
opinions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
can
not
talk
of
books
in
a
ball-room
;
my
head
is
always
full
of
*NL*
something
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
_
present
_
always
occupies
you
in
such
scenes
--
does
it
?
''
said
he
,
*NL*
with
a
look
of
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
always
,
''
she
replied
,
without
knowing
what
she
said
,
for
her
*NL*
thoughts
had
wandered
far
from
the
subject
,
as
soon
afterwards
appeared
*NL*
by
her
suddenly
exclaiming
,
``
I
remember
hearing
you
once
say
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
*NL*
that
you
hardly
ever
forgave
,
that
your
resentment
once
created
was
*NL*
unappeasable
.
You
are
very
cautious
,
I
suppose
,
as
to
its
_
being
*NL*
created

.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,

said
he
,
with
a
firm
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
never
allow
yourself
to
be
blinded
by
prejudice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
particularly
incumbent
on
those
who
never

their

*NL*
to
be
secure
of
judging
properly
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
to
what
these
questions
tend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merely
to
the
illustration
of

your

character

said
she
,
endeavouring
*NL*
to
shake
off
her
gravity
.
``
I
am
trying
to
make
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
your
success
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
``
I
do
not
get
on
at
all
.
I
hear
such
different
*NL*
accounts
of
you
as
puzzle
me
exceedingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
readily
believe

answered
he
gravely
,
``
that
reports
may
vary
*NL*
greatly
with
respect

I
could
wish

Miss
Bennet
,
that
you
were
*NL*
not
to
sketch
my
character
at
the
present
moment
,
as
there
is
reason
to
*NL*
fear
that
the
performance
would
reflect
no
credit
on
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
do
not
take
your

now

I
may
never

another
*NL*
opportunity

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
by
no
means
suspend
any
pleasure
of
yours
,
''
he
coldly
replied
.
*NL*
She
said
no
more
,
and
they
went
down
the
other
dance
and
parted
in
*NL*
silence
;
and
on
each
side
dissatisfied
,
though
not
to
an
equal
degree
,
*NL*
for
in
Darcy
's
breast
there
was
a
tolerably
powerful
feeling
towards
*NL*
her
,
which
soon
procured
her
pardon
,
and
directed
all
his
anger
against
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
long
separated
,
when
Miss
Bingley
came
towards
her
,
and
*NL*
with
an
expression
of
civil
disdain
accosted
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
Miss
Eliza
,
I
hear
you
are
quite
delighted
with
George
Wickham
!
*NL*
Your
sister
has
been
talking
to
me
about
him
,
and
asking
me
a
thousand
*NL*
questions
;
and
I
find
that
the
young
man
quite
forgot
to
tell
you
,
among
*NL*
his
other
communication
,
that
he
was
the
son
of
old
Wickham
,
the
late
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
's
steward
.
Let
me
recommend
you
,
however
,
as
a
friend
,
not
to
*NL*
give
implicit
confidence
to
all
his
assertions
;
for
as
to
Mr.
Darcy
's
*NL*
using
him
ill
,
it
is
perfectly
false
;
for
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
has
*NL*
always
been
remarkably
kind
to
him
,
though
George
Wickham
has
treated
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
in
a
most
infamous
manner
.
I
do
not
know
the
particulars
,
but
*NL*
I
know
very
well
that
Mr.
Darcy
is
not
in
the
least
to
blame
,
that
he
*NL*
can
not
bear
to
hear
George
Wickham
mentioned
,
and
that
though
my
brother
*NL*
thought
that
he
could
not
well
avoid
including
him
in
his
invitation
to
*NL*
the
officers
,
he
was
excessively
glad
to
find
that
he
had
taken
himself
*NL*
out
of
the
way
.
His
coming
into
the
country
at
all
is
a
most
insolent
*NL*
thing
,
indeed
,
and
I
wonder
how
he
could
presume
to
do
it
.
I
pity
you
,
*NL*
Miss
Eliza
,
for
this
discovery
of
your
favourite
's
guilt
;
but
really
,
*NL*
considering
his
descent
,
one
could
not
expect
much
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
guilt
and
his
descent
appear
by
your
account
to
be
the
same
,
''
said
*NL*
Elizabeth
angrily
;
``
for
I
have
heard
you
accuse
him
of
nothing
worse
*NL*
than
of
being
the
son
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
steward
,
and
of
_
that
_
,
I
can
*NL*
assure
you
,
he
informed
me
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
replied
Miss
Bingley
,
turning
away
with
a
sneer
.
*NL*
``
Excuse
my
interference
--
it
was
kindly
meant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Insolent
girl
!
''
said
Elizabeth
to
herself
.
``
You
are
much
mistaken
*NL*
if
you
expect
to
influence
me
by
such
a
paltry
attack
as
this
.
I
see
*NL*
nothing
in
it
but
your
own
wilful
ignorance
and
the
malice
of
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
.
''
She
then
sought
her
eldest
sister
,
who
had
undertaken
to
make
*NL*
inquiries
on
the
same
subject
of
Bingley
.
Jane
met
her
with
a
smile
of
*NL*
such
sweet
complacency
,
a
glow
of
such
happy
expression
,
as
sufficiently
*NL*
marked
how
well
she
was
satisfied
with
the
occurrences
of
the
evening
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
instantly
read
her
feelings
,
and
at
that
moment
solicitude
for
*NL*
Wickham
,
resentment
against
his
enemies
,
and
everything
else
,
gave
way
*NL*
before
the
hope
of
Jane
's
being
in
the
fairest
way
for
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
know
,
''
said
she
,
with
a
countenance
no
less
smiling
than
her
*NL*
sister
's
,
``
what
you
have
learnt
about
Mr.
Wickham
.
But
perhaps
you
have
*NL*
been
too
pleasantly
engaged
to
think
of
any
third
person
;
in
which
case
*NL*
you
may
be
sure
of
my
pardon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Jane
,
``
I
have
not
forgotten
him
;
but
I
have
nothing
*NL*
satisfactory
to
tell
you
.
Mr.
Bingley
does
not
know
the
whole
of
*NL*
his
history
,
and
is
quite
ignorant
of
the
circumstances
which
have
*NL*
principally
offended
Mr.
Darcy
;
but
he
will
vouch
for
the
good
conduct
,
*NL*
the
probity
,
and
honour
of
his
friend
,
and
is
perfectly
convinced
that
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
has
deserved
much
less
attention
from
Mr.
Darcy
than
he
has
*NL*
received
;
and
I
am
sorry
to
say
by
his
account
as
well
as
his
sister
's
,
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
is
by
no
means
a
respectable
young
man
.
I
am
afraid
he
has
*NL*
been
very
imprudent
,
and
has
deserved
to
lose
Mr.
Darcy
's
regard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Bingley
does
not
know
Mr.
Wickham
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
he
never
saw
him
till
the
other
morning
at
Meryton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
account
then
is
what
he
has
received
from
Mr.
Darcy
.
I
am
*NL*
satisfied
.
But
what
does
he
say
of
the
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
not
exactly
recollect
the
circumstances
,
though
he
has
heard
*NL*
them
from
Mr.
Darcy
more
than
once
,
but
he
believes
that
it
was
left
to
*NL*
him
_
conditionally
_
only
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
a
doubt
of
Mr.
Bingley
's
sincerity
,
''
said
Elizabeth
warmly
;
*NL*
``
but
you
must
excuse
my
not
being
convinced
by
assurances
only
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bingley
's
defense
of
his
friend
was
a
very
able
one
,
I
dare
say
;
but
*NL*
since
he
is
unacquainted
with
several
parts
of
the
story
,
and
has
learnt
*NL*
the
rest
from
that
friend
himself
,
I
shall
venture
to
still
think
of
*NL*
both
gentlemen
as
I
did
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
changed
the
discourse
to
one
more
gratifying
to
each
,
and
on
*NL*
which
there
could
be
no
difference
of
sentiment
.
Elizabeth
listened
with
*NL*
delight
to
the
happy
,
though
modest
hopes
which
Jane
entertained
of
Mr.
*NL*
Bingley
's
regard
,
and
said
all
in
her
power
to
heighten
her
confidence
*NL*
in
it
.
On
their
being
joined
by
Mr.
Bingley
himself
,
Elizabeth
withdrew
*NL*
to
Miss
Lucas
;
to
whose
inquiry
after
the
pleasantness
of
her
last
*NL*
partner
she
had
scarcely
replied
,
before
Mr.
Collins
came
up
to
them
,
*NL*
and
told
her
with
great
exultation
that
he
had
just
been
so
fortunate
as
*NL*
to
make
a
most
important
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
found
out
,
''
said
he
,
``
by
a
singular
accident
,
that
there
is
now
*NL*
in
the
room
a
near
relation
of
my
patroness
.
I
happened
to
overhear
the
*NL*
gentleman
himself
mentioning
to
the
young
lady
who
does
the
honours
of
*NL*
the
house
the
names
of
his
cousin
Miss
de
Bourgh
,
and
of
her
mother
Lady
*NL*
Catherine
.
How
wonderfully
these
sort
of
things
occur
!
Who
would
have
*NL*
thought
of
my
meeting
with
,
perhaps
,
a
nephew
of
Lady
Catherine
de
*NL*
Bourgh
in
this
assembly
!
I
am
most
thankful
that
the
discovery
is
made
*NL*
in
time
for
me
to
pay
my
respects
to
him
,
which
I
am
now
going
to
*NL*
do
,
and
trust
he
will
excuse
my
not
having
done
it
before
.
My
total
*NL*
ignorance
of
the
connection
must
plead
my
apology
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
going
to
introduce
yourself
to
Mr.
Darcy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
am
.
I
shall
entreat
his
pardon
for
not
having
done
it
earlier
.
*NL*
I
believe
him
to
be
Lady
Catherine
's
_
nephew
_
.
It
will
be
in
my
power
to
*NL*
assure
him
that
her
ladyship
was
quite
well
yesterday
se
`
nnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
tried
hard
to
dissuade
him
from
such
a
scheme
,
assuring
him
*NL*
that
Mr.
Darcy
would
consider
his
addressing
him
without
introduction
*NL*
as
an
impertinent
freedom
,
rather
than
a
compliment
to
his
aunt
;
that
*NL*
it
was
not
in
the
least
necessary
there
should
be
any
notice
on
either
*NL*
side
;
and
that
if
it
were
,
it
must
belong
to
Mr.
Darcy
,
the
superior
in
*NL*
consequence
,
to
begin
the
acquaintance
.
Mr.
Collins
listened
to
her
*NL*
with
the
determined
air
of
following
his
own
inclination
,
and
,
when
she
*NL*
ceased
speaking
,
replied
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Elizabeth
,
I
have
the
highest
opinion
in
the
world
in
*NL*
your
excellent
judgement
in
all
matters
within
the
scope
of
your
*NL*
understanding
;
but
permit
me
to
say
,
that
there
must
be
a
wide
*NL*
difference
between
the
established
forms
of
ceremony
amongst
the
laity
,
*NL*
and
those
which
regulate
the
clergy
;
for
,
give
me
leave
to
observe
that
*NL*
I
consider
the
clerical
office
as
equal
in
point
of
dignity
with
*NL*
the
highest
rank
in
the
kingdom
--
provided
that
a
proper
humility
of
*NL*
behaviour
is
at
the
same
time
maintained
.
You
must
therefore
allow
me
to
*NL*
follow
the
dictates
of
my
conscience
on
this
occasion
,
which
leads
me
to
*NL*
perform
what
I
look
on
as
a
point
of
duty
.
Pardon
me
for
neglecting
to
*NL*
profit
by
your
advice
,
which
on
every
other
subject
shall
be
my
constant
*NL*
guide
,
though
in
the
case
before
us
I
consider
myself
more
fitted
by
*NL*
education
and
habitual
study
to
decide
on
what
is
right
than
a
young
*NL*
lady
like
yourself
.
''
And
with
a
low
bow
he
left
her
to
attack
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
,
whose
reception
of
his
advances
she
eagerly
watched
,
and
whose
*NL*
astonishment
at
being
so
addressed
was
very
evident
.
Her
cousin
prefaced
*NL*
his
speech
with
a
solemn
bow
and
though
she
could
not
hear
a
word
of
*NL*
it
,
she
felt
as
if
hearing
it
all
,
and
saw
in
the
motion
of
his
lips
the
*NL*
words
``
apology
,
''
``
Hunsford
,
''
and
``
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
.
''
It
vexed
*NL*
her
to
see
him
expose
himself
to
such
a
man
.
Mr.
Darcy
was
eyeing
him
*NL*
with
unrestrained
wonder
,
and
when
at
last
Mr.
Collins
allowed
him
time
*NL*
to
speak
,
replied
with
an
air
of
distant
civility
.
Mr.
Collins
,
however
,
*NL*
was
not
discouraged
from
speaking
again
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
's
contempt
seemed
*NL*
abundantly
increasing
with
the
length
of
his
second
speech
,
and
at
the
*NL*
end
of
it
he
only
made
him
a
slight
bow
,
and
moved
another
way
.
Mr.
*NL*
Collins
then
returned
to
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
reason
,
I
assure
you
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
be
dissatisfied
with
my
*NL*
reception
.
Mr.
Darcy
seemed
much
pleased
with
the
attention
.
He
answered
*NL*
me
with
the
utmost
civility
,
and
even
paid
me
the
compliment
of
saying
*NL*
that
he
was
so
well
convinced
of
Lady
Catherine
's
discernment
as
to
be
*NL*
certain
she
could
never
bestow
a
favour
unworthily
.
It
was
really
a
very
*NL*
handsome
thought
.
Upon
the
whole
,
I
am
much
pleased
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Elizabeth
had
no
longer
any
interest
of
her
own
to
pursue
,
she
turned
*NL*
her
attention
almost
entirely
on
her
sister
and
Mr.
Bingley
;
and
the
*NL*
train
of
agreeable
reflections
which
her
observations
gave
birth
to
,
*NL*
made
her
perhaps
almost
as
happy
as
Jane
.
She
saw
her
in
idea
settled
in
*NL*
that
very
house
,
in
all
the
felicity
which
a
marriage
of
true
affection
*NL*
could
bestow
;
and
she
felt
capable
,
under
such
circumstances
,
of
*NL*
endeavouring
even
to
like
Bingley
's
two
sisters
.
Her
mother
's
thoughts
*NL*
she
plainly
saw
were
bent
the
same
way
,
and
she
determined
not
to
*NL*
venture
near
her
,
lest
she
might
hear
too
much
.
When
they
sat
down
to
*NL*
supper
,
therefore
,
she
considered
it
a
most
unlucky
perverseness
which
*NL*
placed
them
within
one
of
each
other
;
and
deeply
was
she
vexed
to
find
*NL*
that
her
mother
was
talking
to
that
one
person
-LRB-
Lady
Lucas
-RRB-
freely
,
*NL*
openly
,
and
of
nothing
else
but
her
expectation
that
Jane
would
soon
*NL*
be
married
to
Mr.
Bingley
.
It
was
an
animating
subject
,
and
Mrs.
Bennet
*NL*
seemed
incapable
of
fatigue
while
enumerating
the
advantages
of
the
*NL*
match
.
His
being
such
a
charming
young
man
,
and
so
rich
,
and
living
but
*NL*
three
miles
from
them
,
were
the
first
points
of
self-gratulation
;
and
*NL*
then
it
was
such
a
comfort
to
think
how
fond
the
two
sisters
were
of
*NL*
Jane
,
and
to
be
certain
that
they
must
desire
the
connection
as
much
as
*NL*
she
could
do
.
It
was
,
moreover
,
such
a
promising
thing
for
her
younger
*NL*
daughters
,
as
Jane
's
marrying
so
greatly
must
throw
them
in
the
way
of
*NL*
other
rich
men
;
and
lastly
,
it
was
so
pleasant
at
her
time
of
life
to
be
*NL*
able
to
consign
her
single
daughters
to
the
care
of
their
sister
,
that
*NL*
she
might
not
be
obliged
to
go
into
company
more
than
she
liked
.
It
was
*NL*
necessary
to
make
this
circumstance
a
matter
of
pleasure
,
because
on
*NL*
such
occasions
it
is
the
etiquette
;
but
no
one
was
less
likely
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
to
find
comfort
in
staying
home
at
any
period
of
her
life
.
She
*NL*
concluded
with
many
good
wishes
that
Lady
Lucas
might
soon
be
equally
*NL*
fortunate
,
though
evidently
and
triumphantly
believing
there
was
no
*NL*
chance
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
did
Elizabeth
endeavour
to
check
the
rapidity
of
her
mother
's
*NL*
words
,
or
persuade
her
to
describe
her
felicity
in
a
less
audible
*NL*
whisper
;
for
,
to
her
inexpressible
vexation
,
she
could
perceive
that
the
*NL*
chief
of
it
was
overheard
by
Mr.
Darcy
,
who
sat
opposite
to
them
.
Her
*NL*
mother
only
scolded
her
for
being
nonsensical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
Mr.
Darcy
to
me
,
pray
,
that
I
should
be
afraid
of
him
?
I
am
*NL*
sure
we
owe
him
no
such
particular
civility
as
to
be
obliged
to
say
*NL*
nothing
_
he
_
may
not
like
to
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
heaven
's
sake
,
madam
,
speak
lower
.
What
advantage
can
it
be
for
you
*NL*
to
offend
Mr.
Darcy
?
You
will
never
recommend
yourself
to
his
friend
by
*NL*
so
doing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
that
she
could
say
,
however
,
had
any
influence
.
Her
mother
would
*NL*
talk
of
her
views
in
the
same
intelligible
tone
.
Elizabeth
blushed
and
*NL*
blushed
again
with
shame
and
vexation
.
She
could
not
help
frequently
*NL*
glancing
her
eye
at
Mr.
Darcy
,
though
every
glance
convinced
her
of
what
*NL*
she
dreaded
;
for
though
he
was
not
always
looking
at
her
mother
,
she
was
*NL*
convinced
that
his
attention
was
invariably
fixed
by
her
.
The
expression
*NL*
of
his
face
changed
gradually
from
indignant
contempt
to
a
composed
and
*NL*
steady
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
however
,
Mrs.
Bennet
had
no
more
to
say
;
and
Lady
Lucas
,
who
*NL*
had
been
long
yawning
at
the
repetition
of
delights
which
she
saw
no
*NL*
likelihood
of
sharing
,
was
left
to
the
comforts
of
cold
ham
and
*NL*
chicken
.
Elizabeth
now
began
to
revive
.
But
not
long
was
the
interval
of
*NL*
tranquillity
;
for
,
when
supper
was
over
,
singing
was
talked
of
,
and
*NL*
she
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
Mary
,
after
very
little
entreaty
,
*NL*
preparing
to
oblige
the
company
.
By
many
significant
looks
and
silent
*NL*
entreaties
,
did
she
endeavour
to
prevent
such
a
proof
of
complaisance
,
*NL*
but
in
vain
;
Mary
would
not
understand
them
;
such
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
exhibiting
was
delightful
to
her
,
and
she
began
her
song
.
Elizabeth
's
*NL*
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
with
most
painful
sensations
,
and
she
watched
her
*NL*
progress
through
the
several
stanzas
with
an
impatience
which
was
very
*NL*
ill
rewarded
at
their
close
;
for
Mary
,
on
receiving
,
amongst
the
thanks
*NL*
of
the
table
,
the
hint
of
a
hope
that
she
might
be
prevailed
on
to
*NL*
favour
them
again
,
after
the
pause
of
half
a
minute
began
another
.
*NL*
Mary
's
powers
were
by
no
means
fitted
for
such
a
display
;
her
voice
was
*NL*
weak
,
and
her
manner
affected
.
Elizabeth
was
in
agonies
.
She
looked
at
*NL*
Jane
,
to
see
how
she
bore
it
;
but
Jane
was
very
composedly
talking
to
*NL*
Bingley
.
She
looked
at
his
two
sisters
,
and
saw
them
making
signs
*NL*
of
derision
at
each
other
,
and
at
Darcy
,
who
continued
,
however
,
*NL*
imperturbably
grave
.
She
looked
at
her
father
to
entreat
his
*NL*
interference
,
lest
Mary
should
be
singing
all
night
.
He
took
the
hint
,
*NL*
and
when
Mary
had
finished
her
second
song
,
said
aloud
,
``
That
will
do
*NL*
extremely
well
,
child
.
You
have
delighted
us
long
enough
.
Let
the
other
*NL*
young
ladies
have
time
to
exhibit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
,
though
pretending
not
to
hear
,
was
somewhat
disconcerted
;
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
sorry
for
her
,
and
sorry
for
her
father
's
speech
,
was
afraid
*NL*
her
anxiety
had
done
no
good
.
Others
of
the
party
were
now
applied
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
,
''
said
Mr.
Collins
,
``
were
so
fortunate
as
to
be
able
to
sing
,
I
*NL*
should
have
great
pleasure
,
I
am
sure
,
in
obliging
the
company
with
an
*NL*
air
;
for
I
consider
music
as
a
very
innocent
diversion
,
and
perfectly
*NL*
compatible
with
the
profession
of
a
clergyman
.
I
do
not
mean
,
however
,
*NL*
to
assert
that
we
can
be
justified
in
devoting
too
much
of
our
time
*NL*
to
music
,
for
there
are
certainly
other
things
to
be
attended
to
.
The
*NL*
rector
of
a
parish
has
much
to
do
.
In
the
first
place
,
he
must
make
*NL*
such
an
agreement
for
tithes
as
may
be
beneficial
to
himself
and
not
*NL*
offensive
to
his
patron
.
He
must
write
his
own
sermons
;
and
the
time
*NL*
that
remains
will
not
be
too
much
for
his
parish
duties
,
and
the
care
*NL*
and
improvement
of
his
dwelling
,
which
he
can
not
be
excused
from
making
*NL*
as
comfortable
as
possible
.
And
I
do
not
think
it
of
light
importance
*NL*
that
he
should
have
attentive
and
conciliatory
manners
towards
everybody
,
*NL*
especially
towards
those
to
whom
he
owes
his
preferment
.
I
can
not
acquit
*NL*
him
of
that
duty
;
nor
could
I
think
well
of
the
man
who
should
omit
an
*NL*
occasion
of
testifying
his
respect
towards
anybody
connected
with
the
*NL*
family
.
''
And
with
a
bow
to
Mr.
Darcy
,
he
concluded
his
speech
,
which
had
*NL*
been
spoken
so
loud
as
to
be
heard
by
half
the
room
.
Many
stared
--
many
*NL*
smiled
;
but
no
one
looked
more
amused
than
Mr.
Bennet
himself
,
while
his
*NL*
wife
seriously
commended
Mr.
Collins
for
having
spoken
so
sensibly
,
*NL*
and
observed
in
a
half-whisper
to
Lady
Lucas
,
that
he
was
a
remarkably
*NL*
clever
,
good
kind
of
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Elizabeth
it
appeared
that
,
had
her
family
made
an
agreement
to
*NL*
expose
themselves
as
much
as
they
could
during
the
evening
,
it
would
*NL*
have
been
impossible
for
them
to
play
their
parts
with
more
spirit
or
*NL*
finer
success
;
and
happy
did
she
think
it
for
Bingley
and
her
sister
*NL*
that
some
of
the
exhibition
had
escaped
his
notice
,
and
that
his
*NL*
feelings
were
not
of
a
sort
to
be
much
distressed
by
the
folly
which
he
*NL*
must
have
witnessed
.
That
his
two
sisters
and
Mr.
Darcy
,
however
,
should
*NL*
have
such
an
opportunity
of
ridiculing
her
relations
,
was
bad
enough
,
*NL*
and
she
could
not
determine
whether
the
silent
contempt
of
the
*NL*
gentleman
,
or
the
insolent
smiles
of
the
ladies
,
were
more
intolerable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
evening
brought
her
little
amusement
.
She
was
teased
by
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
,
who
continued
most
perseveringly
by
her
side
,
and
though
*NL*
he
could
not
prevail
on
her
to
dance
with
him
again
,
put
it
out
of
her
*NL*
power
to
dance
with
others
.
In
vain
did
she
entreat
him
to
stand
up
with
*NL*
somebody
else
,
and
offer
to
introduce
him
to
any
young
lady
in
the
room
.
*NL*
He
assured
her
,
that
as
to
dancing
,
he
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
it
;
*NL*
that
his
chief
object
was
by
delicate
attentions
to
recommend
himself
to
*NL*
her
and
that
he
should
therefore
make
a
point
of
remaining
close
to
her
*NL*
the
whole
evening
.
There
was
no
arguing
upon
such
a
project
.
She
owed
*NL*
her
greatest
relief
to
her
friend
Miss
Lucas
,
who
often
joined
them
,
and
*NL*
good-naturedly
engaged
Mr.
Collins
's
conversation
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
at
least
free
from
the
offense
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
further
notice
;
*NL*
though
often
standing
within
a
very
short
distance
of
her
,
quite
*NL*
disengaged
,
he
never
came
near
enough
to
speak
.
She
felt
it
to
be
the
*NL*
probable
consequence
of
her
allusions
to
Mr.
Wickham
,
and
rejoiced
in
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Longbourn
party
were
the
last
of
all
the
company
to
depart
,
and
,
by
*NL*
a
manoeuvre
of
Mrs.
Bennet
,
had
to
wait
for
their
carriage
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
after
everybody
else
was
gone
,
which
gave
them
time
to
see
how
*NL*
heartily
they
were
wished
away
by
some
of
the
family
.
Mrs.
Hurst
and
her
*NL*
sister
scarcely
opened
their
mouths
,
except
to
complain
of
fatigue
,
and
*NL*
were
evidently
impatient
to
have
the
house
to
themselves
.
They
repulsed
*NL*
every
attempt
of
Mrs.
Bennet
at
conversation
,
and
by
so
doing
threw
a
*NL*
languor
over
the
whole
party
,
which
was
very
little
relieved
by
the
*NL*
long
speeches
of
Mr.
Collins
,
who
was
complimenting
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
*NL*
sisters
on
the
elegance
of
their
entertainment
,
and
the
hospitality
and
*NL*
politeness
which
had
marked
their
behaviour
to
their
guests
.
Darcy
said
*NL*
nothing
at
all
.
Mr.
Bennet
,
in
equal
silence
,
was
enjoying
the
scene
.
*NL*
Mr.
Bingley
and
Jane
were
standing
together
,
a
little
detached
from
the
*NL*
rest
,
and
talked
only
to
each
other
.
Elizabeth
preserved
as
steady
a
*NL*
silence
as
either
Mrs.
Hurst
or
Miss
Bingley
;
and
even
Lydia
was
too
*NL*
much
fatigued
to
utter
more
than
the
occasional
exclamation
of
``
Lord
,
*NL*
how
tired
I
am
!
''
accompanied
by
a
violent
yawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
at
length
they
arose
to
take
leave
,
Mrs.
Bennet
was
most
pressingly
*NL*
civil
in
her
hope
of
seeing
the
whole
family
soon
at
Longbourn
,
and
*NL*
addressed
herself
especially
to
Mr.
Bingley
,
to
assure
him
how
happy
he
*NL*
would
make
them
by
eating
a
family
dinner
with
them
at
any
time
,
without
*NL*
the
ceremony
of
a
formal
invitation
.
Bingley
was
all
grateful
pleasure
,
*NL*
and
he
readily
engaged
for
taking
the
earliest
opportunity
of
waiting
on
*NL*
her
,
after
his
return
from
London
,
whither
he
was
obliged
to
go
the
next
*NL*
day
for
a
short
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
was
perfectly
satisfied
,
and
quitted
the
house
under
the
*NL*
delightful
persuasion
that
,
allowing
for
the
necessary
preparations
of
*NL*
settlements
,
new
carriages
,
and
wedding
clothes
,
she
should
undoubtedly
*NL*
see
her
daughter
settled
at
Netherfield
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
*NL*
months
.
Of
having
another
daughter
married
to
Mr.
Collins
,
she
thought
*NL*
with
equal
certainty
,
and
with
considerable
,
though
not
equal
,
pleasure
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
the
least
dear
to
her
of
all
her
children
;
and
though
the
*NL*
man
and
the
match
were
quite
good
enough
for
_
her
_
,
the
worth
of
each
*NL*
was
eclipsed
by
Mr.
Bingley
and
Netherfield
.

Chapter
19
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
opened
a
new
scene
at
Longbourn
.
Mr.
Collins
made
his
*NL*
declaration
in
form
.
Having
resolved
to
do
it
without
loss
of
time
,
as
*NL*
his
leave
of
absence
extended
only
to
the
following
Saturday
,
and
having
*NL*
no
feelings
of
diffidence
to
make
it
distressing
to
himself
even
at
*NL*
the
moment
,
he
set
about
it
in
a
very
orderly
manner
,
with
all
the
*NL*
observances
,
which
he
supposed
a
regular
part
of
the
business
.
On
*NL*
finding
Mrs.
Bennet
,
Elizabeth
,
and
one
of
the
younger
girls
together
,
*NL*
soon
after
breakfast
,
he
addressed
the
mother
in
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
hope
,
madam
,
for
your
interest
with
your
fair
daughter
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
when
I
solicit
for
the
honour
of
a
private
audience
with
her
in
the
*NL*
course
of
this
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Elizabeth
had
time
for
anything
but
a
blush
of
surprise
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
answered
instantly
,
``
Oh
dear
!
--
yes
--
certainly
.
I
am
sure
Lizzy
*NL*
will
be
very
happy
--
I
am
sure
she
can
have
no
objection
.
Come
,
Kitty
,
I
*NL*
want
you
up
stairs
.
''
And
,
gathering
her
work
together
,
she
was
hastening
*NL*
away
,
when
Elizabeth
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
madam
,
do
not
go
.
I
beg
you
will
not
go
.
Mr.
Collins
must
excuse
*NL*
me
.
He
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
that
anybody
need
not
hear
.
I
am
*NL*
going
away
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
nonsense
,
Lizzy
.
I
desire
you
to
stay
where
you
are
.
''
And
upon
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
seeming
really
,
with
vexed
and
embarrassed
looks
,
about
to
*NL*
escape
,
she
added
:
``
Lizzy
,
I
_
insist
_
upon
your
staying
and
hearing
Mr.
*NL*
Collins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
would
not
oppose
such
an
injunction
--
and
a
moment
's
*NL*
consideration
making
her
also
sensible
that
it
would
be
wisest
to
get
it
*NL*
over
as
soon
and
as
quietly
as
possible
,
she
sat
down
again
and
tried
to
*NL*
conceal
,
by
incessant
employment
the
feelings
which
were
divided
between
*NL*
distress
and
diversion
.
Mrs.
Bennet
and
Kitty
walked
off
,
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
they
were
gone
,
Mr.
Collins
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
my
dear
Miss
Elizabeth
,
that
your
modesty
,
so
far
from
*NL*
doing
you
any
disservice
,
rather
adds
to
your
other
perfections
.
You
*NL*
would
have
been
less
amiable
in
my
eyes
had
there
_
not
_
been
this
little
*NL*
unwillingness
;
but
allow
me
to
assure
you
,
that
I
have
your
respected
*NL*
mother
's
permission
for
this
address
.
You
can
hardly
doubt
the
*NL*
purport
of
my
discourse
,
however
your
natural
delicacy
may
lead
you
to
*NL*
dissemble
;
my
attentions
have
been
too
marked
to
be
mistaken
.
Almost
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
entered
the
house
,
I
singled
you
out
as
the
companion
of
*NL*
my
future
life
.
But
before
I
am
run
away
with
by
my
feelings
on
this
*NL*
subject
,
perhaps
it
would
be
advisable
for
me
to
state
my
reasons
for
*NL*
marrying
--
and
,
moreover
,
for
coming
into
Hertfordshire
with
the
design
*NL*
of
selecting
a
wife
,
as
I
certainly
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
Mr.
Collins
,
with
all
his
solemn
composure
,
being
run
away
*NL*
with
by
his
feelings
,
made
Elizabeth
so
near
laughing
,
that
she
could
*NL*
not
use
the
short
pause
he
allowed
in
any
attempt
to
stop
him
further
,
*NL*
and
he
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
reasons
for
marrying
are
,
first
,
that
I
think
it
a
right
thing
for
*NL*
every
clergyman
in
easy
circumstances
-LRB-
like
myself
-RRB-
to
set
the
example
*NL*
of
matrimony
in
his
parish
;
secondly
,
that
I
am
convinced
that
it
will
*NL*
add
very
greatly
to
my
happiness
;
and
thirdly
--
which
perhaps
I
ought
*NL*
to
have
mentioned
earlier
,
that
it
is
the
particular
advice
and
*NL*
recommendation
of
the
very
noble
lady
whom
I
have
the
honour
of
calling
*NL*
patroness
.
Twice
has
she
condescended
to
give
me
her
opinion
-LRB-
unasked
*NL*
too
!
-RRB-
on
this
subject
;
and
it
was
but
the
very
Saturday
night
before
I
*NL*
left
Hunsford
--
between
our
pools
at
quadrille
,
while
Mrs.
Jenkinson
was
*NL*
arranging
Miss
de
Bourgh
's
footstool
,
that
she
said
,
`
Mr.
Collins
,
you
*NL*
must
marry
.
A
clergyman
like
you
must
marry
.
Choose
properly
,
choose
*NL*
a
gentlewoman
for
_
my
_
sake
;
and
for
your
_
own
_
,
let
her
be
an
active
,
*NL*
useful
sort
of
person
,
not
brought
up
high
,
but
able
to
make
a
small
*NL*
income
go
a
good
way
.
This
is
my
advice
.
Find
such
a
woman
as
soon
as
*NL*
you
can
,
bring
her
to
Hunsford
,
and
I
will
visit
her
.
'
Allow
me
,
by
the
*NL*
way
,
to
observe
,
my
fair
cousin
,
that
I
do
not
reckon
the
notice
*NL*
and
kindness
of
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
as
among
the
least
of
the
*NL*
advantages
in
my
power
to
offer
.
You
will
find
her
manners
beyond
*NL*
anything
I
can
describe
;
and
your
wit
and
vivacity
,
I
think
,
must
be
*NL*
acceptable
to
her
,
especially
when
tempered
with
the
silence
and
*NL*
respect
which
her
rank
will
inevitably
excite
.
Thus
much
for
my
general
*NL*
intention
in
favour
of
matrimony
;
it
remains
to
be
told
why
my
views
*NL*
were
directed
towards
Longbourn
instead
of
my
own
neighbourhood
,
where
I
*NL*
can
assure
you
there
are
many
amiable
young
women
.
But
the
fact
is
,
that
*NL*
being
,
as
I
am
,
to
inherit
this
estate
after
the
death
of
your
honoured
*NL*
father
-LRB-
who
,
however
,
may
live
many
years
longer
-RRB-
,
I
could
not
satisfy
*NL*
myself
without
resolving
to
choose
a
wife
from
among
his
daughters
,
that
*NL*
the
loss
to
them
might
be
as
little
as
possible
,
when
the
melancholy
*NL*
event
takes
place
--
which
,
however
,
as
I
have
already
said
,
may
not
*NL*
be
for
several
years
.
This
has
been
my
motive
,
my
fair
cousin
,
and
*NL*
I
flatter
myself
it
will
not
sink
me
in
your
esteem
.
And
now
nothing
*NL*
remains
for
me
but
to
assure
you
in
the
most
animated
language
of
the
*NL*
violence
of
my
affection
.
To
fortune
I
am
perfectly
indifferent
,
and
*NL*
shall
make
no
demand
of
that
nature
on
your
father
,
since
I
am
well
*NL*
aware
that
it
could
not
be
complied
with
;
and
that
one
thousand
pounds
*NL*
in
the
four
per
cents
,
which
will
not
be
yours
till
after
your
mother
's
*NL*
decease
,
is
all
that
you
may
ever
be
entitled
to
.
On
that
head
,
*NL*
therefore
,
I
shall
be
uniformly
silent
;
and
you
may
assure
yourself
that
*NL*
no
ungenerous
reproach
shall
ever
pass
my
lips
when
we
are
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
absolutely
necessary
to
interrupt
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
hasty
,
sir
,
''
she
cried
.
``
You
forget
that
I
have
made
no
*NL*
answer
.
Let
me
do
it
without
further
loss
of
time
.
Accept
my
thanks
for
*NL*
the
compliment
you
are
paying
me
.
I
am
very
sensible
of
the
honour
of
*NL*
your
proposals
,
but
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
do
otherwise
than
to
*NL*
decline
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
now
to
learn
,
''
replied
Mr.
Collins
,
with
a
formal
wave
of
the
*NL*
hand
,
``
that
it
is
usual
with
young
ladies
to
reject
the
addresses
of
the
*NL*
man
whom
they
secretly
mean
to
accept
,
when
he
first
applies
for
their
*NL*
favour
;
and
that
sometimes
the
refusal
is
repeated
a
second
,
or
even
a
*NL*
third
time
.
I
am
therefore
by
no
means
discouraged
by
what
you
have
just
*NL*
said
,
and
shall
hope
to
lead
you
to
the
altar
ere
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
sir
,
''
cried
Elizabeth
,
``
your
hope
is
a
rather
*NL*
extraordinary
one
after
my
declaration
.
I
do
assure
you
that
I
am
not
*NL*
one
of
those
young
ladies
-LRB-
if
such
young
ladies
there
are
-RRB-
who
are
so
*NL*
daring
as
to
risk
their
happiness
on
the
chance
of
being
asked
a
second
*NL*
time
.
I
am
perfectly
serious
in
my
refusal
.
You
could
not
make
_
me
_
*NL*
happy
,
and
I
am
convinced
that
I
am
the
last
woman
in
the
world
who
*NL*
could
make
you
so
.
Nay
,
were
your
friend
Lady
Catherine
to
know
me
,
I
*NL*
am
persuaded
she
would
find
me
in
every
respect
ill
qualified
for
the
*NL*
situation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
it
certain
that
Lady
Catherine
would
think
so
,
''
said
Mr.
Collins
*NL*
very
gravely
--
``
but
I
can
not
imagine
that
her
ladyship
would
at
all
*NL*
disapprove
of
you
.
And
you
may
be
certain
when
I
have
the
honour
of
*NL*
seeing
her
again
,
I
shall
speak
in
the
very
highest
terms
of
your
*NL*
modesty
,
economy
,
and
other
amiable
qualification
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Mr.
Collins
,
all
praise
of
me
will
be
unnecessary
.
You
*NL*
must
give
me
leave
to
judge
for
myself
,
and
pay
me
the
compliment
*NL*
of
believing
what
I
say
.
I
wish
you
very
happy
and
very
rich
,
and
by
*NL*
refusing
your
hand
,
do
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
your
being
otherwise
.
*NL*
In
making
me
the
offer
,
you
must
have
satisfied
the
delicacy
of
your
*NL*
feelings
with
regard
to
my
family
,
and
may
take
possession
of
Longbourn
*NL*
estate
whenever
it
falls
,
without
any
self-reproach
.
This
matter
may
*NL*
be
considered
,
therefore
,
as
finally
settled
.
''
And
rising
as
she
*NL*
thus
spoke
,
she
would
have
quitted
the
room
,
had
Mr.
Collins
not
thus
*NL*
addressed
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
do
myself
the
honour
of
speaking
to
you
next
on
the
subject
,
I
*NL*
shall
hope
to
receive
a
more
favourable
answer
than
you
have
now
given
*NL*
me
;
though
I
am
far
from
accusing
you
of
cruelty
at
present
,
because
I
*NL*
know
it
to
be
the
established
custom
of
your
sex
to
reject
a
man
on
*NL*
the
first
application
,
and
perhaps
you
have
even
now
said
as
much
to
*NL*
encourage
my
suit
as
would
be
consistent
with
the
true
delicacy
of
the
*NL*
female
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
Mr.
Collins
,
''
cried
Elizabeth
with
some
warmth
,
``
you
puzzle
me
*NL*
exceedingly
.
If
what
I
have
hitherto
said
can
appear
to
you
in
the
form
*NL*
of
encouragement
,
I
know
not
how
to
express
my
refusal
in
such
a
way
as
*NL*
to
convince
you
of
its
being
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
give
me
leave
to
flatter
myself
,
my
dear
cousin
,
that
your
*NL*
refusal
of
my
addresses
is
merely
words
of
course
.
My
reasons
for
*NL*
believing
it
are
briefly
these
:
It
does
not
appear
to
me
that
my
hand
is
*NL*
unworthy
of
your
acceptance
,
or
that
the
establishment
I
can
offer
would
*NL*
be
any
other
than
highly
desirable
.
My
situation
in
life
,
my
connections
*NL*
with
the
family
of
de
Bourgh
,
and
my
relationship
to
your
own
,
are
*NL*
circumstances
highly
in
my
favour
;
and
you
should
take
it
into
further
*NL*
consideration
,
that
in
spite
of
your
manifold
attractions
,
it
is
by
no
*NL*
means
certain
that
another
offer
of
marriage
may
ever
be
made
you
.
Your
*NL*
portion
is
unhappily
so
small
that
it
will
in
all
likelihood
undo
*NL*
the
effects
of
your
loveliness
and
amiable
qualifications
.
As
I
must
*NL*
therefore
conclude
that
you
are
not
serious
in
your
rejection
of
me
,
*NL*
I
shall
choose
to
attribute
it
to
your
wish
of
increasing
my
love
by
*NL*
suspense
,
according
to
the
usual
practice
of
elegant
females
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
assure
you
,
sir
,
that
I
have
no
pretensions
whatever
to
that
kind
*NL*
of
elegance
which
consists
in
tormenting
a
respectable
man
.
I
would
*NL*
rather
be
paid
the
compliment
of
being
believed
sincere
.
I
thank
you
*NL*
again
and
again
for
the
honour
you
have
done
me
in
your
proposals
,
but
*NL*
to
accept
them
is
absolutely
impossible
.
My
feelings
in
every
respect
*NL*
forbid
it
.
Can
I
speak
plainer
?
Do
not
consider
me
now
as
an
elegant
*NL*
female
,
intending
to
plague
you
,
but
as
a
rational
creature
,
speaking
*NL*
the
truth
from
her
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
uniformly
charming
!
''
cried
he
,
with
an
air
of
awkward
*NL*
gallantry
;
``
and
I
am
persuaded
that
when
sanctioned
by
the
express
*NL*
authority
of
both
your
excellent
parents
,
my
proposals
will
not
fail
of
*NL*
being
acceptable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
such
perseverance
in
wilful
self-deception
Elizabeth
would
make
*NL*
no
reply
,
and
immediately
and
in
silence
withdrew
;
determined
,
if
*NL*
he
persisted
in
considering
her
repeated
refusals
as
flattering
*NL*
encouragement
,
to
apply
to
her
father
,
whose
negative
might
be
uttered
*NL*
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
decisive
,
and
whose
behaviour
at
least
could
*NL*
not
be
mistaken
for
the
affectation
and
coquetry
of
an
elegant
female

Chapter
20
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
was
not
left
long
to
the
silent
contemplation
of
his
*NL*
successful
love
;
for
Mrs.
Bennet
,
having
dawdled
about
in
the
vestibule
*NL*
to
watch
for
the
end
of
the
conference
,
no
sooner
saw
Elizabeth
open
*NL*
the
door
and
with
quick
step
pass
her
towards
the
staircase
,
than
she
*NL*
entered
the
breakfast-room
,
and
congratulated
both
him
and
herself
in
*NL*
warm
terms
on
the
happy
prospect
of
their
nearer
connection
.
Mr.
Collins
*NL*
received
and
returned
these
felicitations
with
equal
pleasure
,
and
then
*NL*
proceeded
to
relate
the
particulars
of
their
interview
,
with
the
result
*NL*
of
which
he
trusted
he
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
,
since
the
*NL*
refusal
which
his
cousin
had
steadfastly
given
him
would
naturally
flow
*NL*
from
her
bashful
modesty
and
the
genuine
delicacy
of
her
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
information
,
however
,
startled
Mrs.
Bennet
;
she
would
have
been
*NL*
glad
to
be
equally
satisfied
that
her
daughter
had
meant
to
encourage
*NL*
him
by
protesting
against
his
proposals
,
but
she
dared
not
believe
it
,
*NL*
and
could
not
help
saying
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
depend
upon
it
,
Mr.
Collins
,
''
she
added
,
``
that
Lizzy
shall
be
*NL*
brought
to
reason
.
I
will
speak
to
her
about
it
directly
.
She
is
a
very
*NL*
headstrong
,
foolish
girl
,
and
does
not
know
her
own
interest
but
I
will
*NL*
_
make
_
her
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
for
interrupting
you
,
madam
,
''
cried
Mr.
Collins
;
``
but
if
*NL*
she
is
really
headstrong
and
foolish
,
I
know
not
whether
she
would
*NL*
altogether
be
a
very
desirable
wife
to
a
man
in
my
situation
,
who
*NL*
naturally
looks
for
happiness
in
the
marriage
state
.
If
therefore
she
*NL*
actually
persists
in
rejecting
my
suit
,
perhaps
it
were
better
not
*NL*
to
force
her
into
accepting
me
,
because
if
liable
to
such
defects
of
*NL*
temper
,
she
could
not
contribute
much
to
my
felicity

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
you
quite
misunderstand
me
,

said
Mrs.
Bennet
,
alarmed
.
``
Lizzy
is
*NL*
only
headstrong
in
such
matters
as
these

In
everything
else
she
is
as
*NL*
good-natured
a
girl
as
ever
lived
.
I
will
go
directly
to
Mr.
Bennet
,
and
*NL*
we
shall
very
soon
settle
it
with
her
,
I
am
sure

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
not
give
him
time
to
reply
,
but
hurrying
instantly
to
her
*NL*
husband
,
called
out
as
she
entered
the
library
,
``
Oh
!
Mr.
Bennet
,
you
*NL*
are
wanted
immediately
;
we
are
all
in
an
uproar

You
must
come
and
make
*NL*
Lizzy
marry
Mr.
Collins
,
for
she
vows
she
will
not
have
him
,
and
if
you
*NL*
do
not
make
haste
he
will
change
his
mind
and
not
have
_
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
raised
his
eyes
from
his
book
as
she
entered
,
and
fixed
them
*NL*
on
her
face
with
a
calm
unconcern
which
was
not
in
the
least
altered
by
*NL*
her
communication
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
the
pleasure
of
understanding
you

said
he
,
when
she
had
*NL*
finished
her
speech
.
``
Of
what
are
you
talking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
Mr.
Collins
and
Lizzy

Lizzy
declares
she
will
not
have
Mr.
Collins

*NL*
and
Mr.
Collins
begins
to
say
that
he
will
not
have
Lizzy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
am
I
to
do
on
the
occasion

It
seems
an
hopeless
business

*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
to
Lizzy
about
it
yourself

Tell
her

marrying

be
called
down

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
rang
the
bell
,
and
Miss
Elizabeth
was
summoned
to
the
*NL*
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
child
,
''
cried
her
father
as
she
appeared
.
``
I
have
sent
for
*NL*
you
on
an
affair

I
understand
that
Mr.

has
made

you
an
offer
of
marriage

Is
it
true

Elizabeth
replied
that
it
was

``
Very
well

this
offer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
not
but
smile
at
such
a
conclusion
of
such
a
beginning
,
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Bennet
,
who
had
persuaded
herself
that
her
husband
regarded
the
*NL*
affair
as
she
wished
,
was
excessively
disappointed

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

``
My

allow

the
free
use

my
understanding
on
the
*NL*
present
occasion
;
and
secondly
,
of
my
room
.
I
shall
be
glad
to
have
the
*NL*
library
to
myself
as
soon
as
may
be

''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
yet
,
however
,
in
spite
of
her
disappointment
in
her
husband
,
did
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
give
up
the
point
.
She
talked
to
Elizabeth
again
and
again
;
*NL*
coaxed
and
threatened
her
by
turns
.
She
endeavoured
to
secure
Jane
*NL*
in
her
interest
;
but
Jane
,
with
all
possible
mildness
,
declined
*NL*
interfering
;
and
Elizabeth
,
sometimes
with
real
earnestness
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
with
playful
gaiety
,
replied
to
her
attacks
.
Though
her
manner
*NL*
varied
,
however
,
her
determination
never
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
,
meanwhile
,
was
meditating
in
solitude
on
what
had
passed
.
*NL*
He
thought
too
well
of
himself
to
comprehend
on
what
motives
his
cousin
*NL*
could
refuse
him
;
and
though
his
pride
was
hurt
,
he
suffered
in
no
other
*NL*
way
.
His
regard
for
her
was
quite
imaginary
;
and
the
possibility
of
her
*NL*
deserving
her
mother
's
reproach
prevented
his
feeling
any
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
family
were
in
this
confusion
,
Charlotte
Lucas
came
to
spend
*NL*
the
day
with
them
.
She
was
met
in
the
vestibule
by
Lydia
,
who
,
flying
to
*NL*
her
,
cried
in
a
half
whisper
,
``
I
am
glad
you
are
come

for
there
is
such
*NL*
fun
here

What
do
you
think
has
happened
this
morning

Mr.

made
an
offer
to

she
will
not
have

*NL*
*NL*
Charlotte
hardly
had
time
to
answer
,
before
they
were
joined
by
Kitty
,
*NL*
who
came
to
tell
the
same
news
;
and
no
sooner
had
they
entered
the
*NL*
breakfast-room
,
where
Mrs.
Bennet
was
alone
,
than
she
likewise
began
on
*NL*
the
subject
,
calling
on
Miss
Lucas
for
her
compassion
,
and
entreating
*NL*
her
to
persuade
her
friend

the
wishes
of
all
her
*NL*
family

``
Pray
do
,
my
dear
Miss
Lucas

she
added
in
a
melancholy
tone
,
*NL*
``
for
nobody
is
on
my
side
,
nobody
takes
part
with
me
.
I
am
cruelly
used

*NL*
nobody
feels
for
my
poor
nerves

''
*NL*
*NL*
Charlotte
's
reply
was
spared
by
the
entrance
of
Jane
and
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
there
she
comes
,
''
continued
Mrs.
Bennet
,
``
looking
as
unconcerned
*NL*
as
may
be
,
and
caring
no
more
for
us
than
if
we
were
at
York
,
provided
*NL*
she
can
have
her
own
way
.
But
I
tell
you
,
Miss
Lizzy
--
if
you
take
it
*NL*
into
your
head
to
go
on
refusing
every
offer
of
marriage
in
this
way
,
*NL*
you
will
never
get
a
husband
at
all
--
and
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
who
is
*NL*
to
maintain
you
when
your
father
is
dead
.
I
shall
not
be
able
to
keep
*NL*
you
--
and
so
I
warn
you
.
I
have
done
with
you
from
this
very
day
.
I
told
*NL*
you
in
the
library
,
you
know
,
that
I
should
never
speak
to
you
again
,
*NL*
and
you
will
find
me
as
good
as
my
word
.
I
have
no
pleasure
in
talking
*NL*
to
undutiful
children
.
Not
that
I
have
much
pleasure
,
indeed
,
in
talking
*NL*
to
anybody
.
People
who
suffer
as
I
do
from
nervous
complaints
can
have
*NL*
no
great
inclination
for
talking
.
Nobody
can
tell
what
I
suffer
!
But
it
*NL*
is
always
so
.
Those
who
do
not
complain
are
never
pitied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
daughters
listened
in
silence
to
this
effusion
,
sensible
that
*NL*
any
attempt
to
reason
with
her
or
soothe
her
would
only
increase
the
*NL*
irritation
.
She
talked
on
,
therefore
,
without
interruption
from
any
of
*NL*
them
,
till
they
were
joined
by
Mr.
Collins
,
who
entered
the
room
with
*NL*
an
air
more
stately
than
usual
,
and
on
perceiving
whom
,
she
said
to
*NL*
the
girls
,
``
Now
,
I
do
insist
upon
it
,
that
you
,
all
of
you
,
hold
*NL*
your
tongues
,
and
let
me
and
Mr.
Collins
have
a
little
conversation
*NL*
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
passed
quietly
out
of
the
room
,
Jane
and
Kitty
followed
,
but
*NL*
Lydia
stood
her
ground
,
determined
to
hear
all
she
could
;
and
Charlotte
,
*NL*
detained
first
by
the
civility
of
Mr.
Collins
,
whose
inquiries
after
*NL*
herself
and
all
her
family
were
very
minute
,
and
then
by
a
little
*NL*
curiosity
,
satisfied
herself
with
walking
to
the
window
and
pretending
*NL*
not
to
hear
.
In
a
doleful
voice
Mrs.
Bennet
began
the
projected
*NL*
conversation
:
``
Oh
!
Mr.
Collins
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
madam
,
''
replied
he
,
``
let
us
be
for
ever
silent
on
this
point
.
*NL*
Far
be
it
from
me
,
''
he
presently
continued
,
in
a
voice
that
marked
his
*NL*
displeasure
,
``
to
resent
the
behaviour
of
your
daughter
.
Resignation
*NL*
to
inevitable
evils
is
the
duty
of
us
all
;
the
peculiar
duty
of
a
*NL*
young
man
who
has
been
so
fortunate
as
I
have
been
in
early
preferment
;
*NL*
and
I
trust
I
am
resigned
.
Perhaps
not
the
less
so
from
feeling
a
doubt
*NL*
of
my
positive
happiness
had
my
fair
cousin
honoured
me
with
her
hand
;
*NL*
for
I
have
often
observed
that
resignation
is
never
so
perfect
as
*NL*
when
the
blessing
denied
begins
to
lose
somewhat
of
its
value
in
our
*NL*
estimation
.
You
will
not
,
I
hope
,
consider
me
as
showing
any
disrespect
*NL*
to
your
family
,
my
dear
madam
,
by
thus
withdrawing
my
pretensions
to
*NL*
your
daughter
's
favour
,
without
having
paid
yourself
and
Mr.
Bennet
the
*NL*
compliment
of
requesting
you
to
interpose
your
authority
in
my
*NL*
behalf
.
My
conduct
may
,
I
fear
,
be
objectionable
in
having
accepted
my
*NL*
dismission
from
your
daughter
's
lips
instead
of
your
own
.
But
we
are
all
*NL*
liable
to
error
.
I
have
certainly
meant
well
through
the
whole
affair
.
*NL*
My
object
has
been
to
secure
an
amiable
companion
for
myself
,
with
due
*NL*
consideration
for
the
advantage
of
all
your
family
,
and
if
my
_
manner
_
*NL*
has
been
at
all
reprehensible
,
I
here
beg
leave
to
apologise
.

Chapter
21
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
discussion
of
Mr.
Collins
's
offer
was
now
nearly
at
an
end
,
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
only
to
suffer
from
the
uncomfortable
feelings
necessarily
*NL*
attending
it
,
and
occasionally
from
some
peevish
allusions
of
her
*NL*
mother
.
As
for
the
gentleman
himself
,
_
his
_
feelings
were
chiefly
*NL*
expressed
,
not
by
embarrassment
or
dejection
,
or
by
trying
to
avoid
her
,
*NL*
but
by
stiffness
of
manner
and
resentful
silence
.
He
scarcely
ever
spoke
*NL*
to
her
,
and
the
assiduous
attentions
which
he
had
been
so
sensible
of
*NL*
himself
were
transferred
for
the
rest
of
the
day
to
Miss
Lucas
,
whose
*NL*
civility
in
listening
to
him
was
a
seasonable
relief
to
them
all
,
and
*NL*
especially
to
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morrow
produced
no
abatement
of
Mrs.
Bennet
's
ill-humour
or
ill
*NL*
health
.
Mr.
Collins
was
also
in
the
same
state
of
angry
pride
.
Elizabeth
*NL*
had
hoped
that
his
resentment
might
shorten
his
visit
,
but
his
plan
did
*NL*
not
appear
in
the
least
affected
by
it
.
He
was
always
to
have
gone
on
*NL*
Saturday
,
and
to
Saturday
he
meant
to
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
,
the
girls
walked
to
Meryton
to
inquire
if
Mr.
Wickham
*NL*
were
returned
,
and
to
lament
over
his
absence
from
the
Netherfield
ball
.
*NL*
He
joined
them
on
their
entering
the
town
,
and
attended
them
to
their
*NL*
aunt
's
where
his
regret
and
vexation
,
and
the
concern
of
everybody
,
was
*NL*
well
talked
over
.
To
Elizabeth
,
however
,
he
voluntarily
acknowledged
*NL*
that
the
necessity
of
his
absence
_
had
_
been
self-imposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
,
''
said
he
,
``
as
the
time
drew
near
that
I
had
better
not
meet
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
;
that
to
be
in
the
same
room
,
the
same
party
with
him
for
so
*NL*
many
hours
together
,
might
be
more
than
I
could
bear
,
and
that
scenes
*NL*
might
arise
unpleasant
to
more
than
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
highly
approved
his
forbearance
,
and
they
had
leisure
for
a
full
*NL*
discussion
of
it
,
and
for
all
the
commendation
which
they
civilly
*NL*
bestowed
on
each
other
,
as
Wickham
and
another
officer
walked
back
with
*NL*
them
to
Longbourn
,
and
during
the
walk
he
particularly
attended
to
*NL*
her
.
His
accompanying
them
was
a
double
advantage
;
she
felt
all
the
*NL*
compliment
it
offered
to
herself
,
and
it
was
most
acceptable
as
an
*NL*
occasion
of
introducing
him
to
her
father
and
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
their
return
,
a
letter
was
delivered
to
Miss
Bennet
;
it
came
*NL*
from
Netherfield
.
The
envelope
contained
a
sheet
of
elegant
,
little
,
*NL*
hot-pressed
paper
,
well
covered
with
a
lady
's
fair
,
flowing
hand
;
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
saw
her
sister
's
countenance
change
as
she
read
it
,
and
saw
*NL*
her
dwelling
intently
on
some
particular
passages
.
Jane
recollected
*NL*
herself
soon
,
and
putting
the
letter
away
,
tried
to
join
with
her
usual
*NL*
cheerfulness
in
the
general
conversation
;
but
Elizabeth
felt
an
anxiety
*NL*
on
the
subject
which
drew
off
her
attention
even
from
Wickham
;
and
no
*NL*
sooner
had
he
and
his
companion
taken
leave
,
than
a
glance
from
Jane
*NL*
invited
her
to
follow
her
up
stairs
.
When
they
had
gained
their
own
room
,
*NL*
Jane
,
taking
out
the
letter
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
from
Caroline
Bingley
;
what
it
contains
has
surprised
me
a
good
*NL*
deal
.
The
whole
party
have
left
Netherfield
by
this
time
,
and
are
on
*NL*
their
way
to
town
--
and
without
any
intention
of
coming
back
again
.
You
*NL*
shall
hear
what
she
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
read
the
first
sentence
aloud
,
which
comprised
the
information
*NL*
of
their
having
just
resolved
to
follow
their
brother
to
town
directly
,
*NL*
and
of
their
meaning
to
dine
in
Grosvenor
Street
,
where
Mr.
Hurst
had
a
*NL*
house
.
The
next
was
in
these
words
:
``
I
do
not
pretend
to
regret
anything
*NL*
I
shall
leave
in
Hertfordshire
,
except
your
society
,
my
dearest
friend
;
*NL*
but
we
will
hope
,
at
some
future
period
,
to
enjoy
many
returns
of
that
*NL*
delightful
intercourse
we
have
known
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
may
*NL*
lessen
the
pain
of
separation
by
a
very
frequent
and
most
unreserved
*NL*
correspondence
.
I
depend
on
you
for
that
.
''
To
these
highflown
*NL*
expressions
Elizabeth
listened
with
all
the
insensibility
of
distrust
;
*NL*
and
though
the
suddenness
of
their
removal
surprised
her
,
she
saw
*NL*
nothing
in
it
really
to
lament
;
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
their
*NL*
absence
from
Netherfield
would
prevent
Mr.
Bingley
's
being
there
;
and
as
*NL*
to
the
loss
of
their
society
,
she
was
persuaded
that
Jane
must
cease
to
*NL*
regard
it
,
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
unlucky
,
''
said
she
,
after
a
short
pause
,
``
that
you
should
not
be
*NL*
able
to
see
your
friends
before
they
leave
the
country
.
But
may
we
not
*NL*
hope
that
the
period
of
future
happiness
to
which
Miss
Bingley
looks
*NL*
forward
may
arrive
earlier
than
she
is
aware
,
and
that
the
delightful
*NL*
intercourse
you
have
known
as
friends
will
be
renewed
with
yet
greater
*NL*
satisfaction
as
sisters
?
Mr.
Bingley
will
not
be
detained
in
London
by
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caroline
decidedly
says
that
none
of
the
party
will
return
into
*NL*
Hertfordshire
this
winter
.
I
will
read
it
to
you
:
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
my
brother
left
us
yesterday
,
he
imagined
that
the
business
which
*NL*
took
him
to
London
might
be
concluded
in
three
or
four
days
;
but
as
we
*NL*
are
certain
it
can
not
be
so
,
and
at
the
same
time
convinced
that
when
*NL*
Charles
gets
to
town
he
will
be
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
again
,
we
have
*NL*
determined
on
following
him
thither
,
that
he
may
not
be
obliged
to
spend
*NL*
his
vacant
hours
in
a
comfortless
hotel
.
Many
of
my
acquaintances
are
*NL*
already
there
for
the
winter
;
I
wish
that
I
could
hear
that
you
,
my
*NL*
dearest
friend
,
had
any
intention
of
making
one
of
the
crowd
--
but
of
*NL*
that
I
despair
.
I
sincerely
hope
your
Christmas
in
Hertfordshire
may
*NL*
abound
in
the
gaieties
which
that
season
generally
brings
,
and
that
your
*NL*
beaux
will
be
so
numerous
as
to
prevent
your
feeling
the
loss
of
the
*NL*
three
of
whom
we
shall
deprive
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
evident
by
this

added
Jane
,
``
that

comes
back
no
more

``
Why
will
you

you
do
not
know

I
_
will

Mr.

is
impatient
to
see
his

,
to
confess
the
truth
,
*NL*
_
we
_
are
scarcely
less
eager
to
meet
her
again
.
I
really
do
not
think
*NL*
Georgiana
Darcy
has
her
equal
for
beauty
,
elegance
,
and
accomplishments
;
*NL*
and
the
affection
she
inspires
in
Louisa
and
myself
is
heightened
into
*NL*
something
still
more
interesting
,
from
the
hope
we
dare
entertain
of
*NL*
her
being
hereafter
our
sister
.
I
do
not
know
whether
I
ever
before
*NL*
mentioned
to

my
feelings

I
will
not
leave
the

confiding
them

I
trust
you

not

them

My

admires
her
greatly
already

he
will

frequent
opportunity
now

seeing
her
on

most
intimate
footing

her
relations
all
wish
the
connection

much

his
own

a
sister

*NL*
partiality
is
not
misleading
me
,
I
think
,
when
I
call
Charles
most
*NL*
capable
of
engaging
any
woman
's
heart
.
With
all
these
circumstances

favour
an
attachment

nothing
to
prevent

am
I
wrong

my

can
not
.
She
*NL*
is
not
such
a
simpleton
.
Could
she
have
seen
half
as
much
love
in
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
for
herself
,
she
would
have
ordered
her
wedding
clothes
.
But
the
*NL*
case
is
this
:
We
are
not
rich
enough
or
grand
enough
for
them
;
and
she
*NL*
is
the
more
anxious
to
get
Miss
Darcy
for
her
brother
,
from
the
notion
*NL*
that
when
there
has
been
_
one
_
intermarriage
,
she
may
have
less
trouble
*NL*
in
achieving
a
second
;
in
which
there
is
certainly
some
ingenuity
,
and
*NL*
I
dare
say
it
would
succeed
,
if
Miss
de
Bourgh
were
out
of
the
way
.
But
,
*NL*
my
dearest
Jane
,
you
can
not
seriously
imagine
that
because
Miss
Bingley
*NL*
tells
you
her
brother
greatly
admires
Miss
Darcy
,
he
is
in
the
smallest
*NL*
degree
less
sensible
of
_
your
_
merit
than
when
he
took
leave
of
you
on
*NL*
Tuesday
,
or
that
it
will
be
in
her
power
to
persuade
him
that
,
instead
*NL*
of
being
in
love
with
you
,
he
is
very
much
in
love
with
her
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
thought
alike
of
Miss
Bingley
,
''
replied
Jane
,
``
your
*NL*
representation
of
all
this
might
make
me
quite
easy
.
But
I
know
the
*NL*
foundation
is
unjust
.
Caroline
is
incapable
of
wilfully
deceiving
*NL*
anyone
;
and
all
that
I
can
hope
in
this
case
is
that
she
is
deceiving
*NL*
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
right
.
You
could
not
have
started
a
more
happy
idea
,
since
you
*NL*
will
not
take
comfort
in
mine
.
Believe
her
to
be
deceived
,
by
all
means
.
*NL*
You
have
now
done
your
duty
by
her
,
and
must
fret
no
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
sister
,
can
I
be
happy
,
even
supposing
the
best
,
in
*NL*
accepting
a
man
whose
sisters
and
friends
are
all
wishing
him
to
marry
*NL*
elsewhere
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
decide
for
yourself
,
''
said
Elizabeth
;
``
and
if
,
upon
mature
*NL*
deliberation
,
you
find
that
the
misery
of
disobliging
his
two
sisters
is
*NL*
more
than
equivalent
to
the
happiness
of
being
his
wife
,
I
advise
you
by
*NL*
all
means
to
refuse
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
talk
so
?
''
said
Jane
,
faintly
smiling
.
``
You
must
know
that
*NL*
though
I
should
be
exceedingly
grieved
at
their
disapprobation
,
I
could
*NL*
not
hesitate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
think
you
would
;
and
that
being
the
case
,
I
can
not
consider
*NL*
your
situation
with
much
compassion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
he
returns
no
more
this
winter
,
my
choice
will
never
be
*NL*
required
.
A
thousand
things
may
arise
in
six
months
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
his
returning
no
more
Elizabeth
treated
with
the
utmost
*NL*
contempt
.
It
appeared
to
her
merely
the
suggestion
of
Caroline
's
*NL*
interested
wishes
,
and
she
could
not
for
a
moment
suppose
that
those
*NL*
wishes
,
however
openly
or
artfully
spoken
,
could
influence
a
young
man
*NL*
so
totally
independent
of
everyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
represented
to
her
sister
as
forcibly
as
possible
what
she
felt
*NL*
on
the
subject
,
and
had
soon
the
pleasure
of
seeing
its
happy
effect
.
*NL*
Jane
's
temper
was
not
desponding
,
and
she
was
gradually
led
to
hope
,
*NL*
though
the
diffidence
of
affection
sometimes
overcame
the
hope
,
that
*NL*
Bingley
would
return
to
Netherfield
and
answer
every
wish
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
agreed
that
Mrs.
Bennet
should
only
hear
of
the
departure
of
the
*NL*
family
,
without
being
alarmed
on
the
score
of
the
gentleman
's
conduct
;
*NL*
but
even
this
partial
communication
gave
her
a
great
deal
of
concern
,
*NL*
and
she
bewailed
it
as
exceedingly
unlucky
that
the
ladies
should
happen
*NL*
to
go
away
just
as
they
were
all
getting
so
intimate
together
.
After
*NL*
lamenting
it
,
however
,
at
some
length
,
she
had
the
consolation
that
Mr.
*NL*
Bingley
would
be
soon
down
again
and
soon
dining
at
Longbourn
,
and
the
*NL*
conclusion
of
all
was
the
comfortable
declaration
,
that
though
he
had
*NL*
been
invited
only
to
a
family
dinner
,
she
would
take
care
to
have
two
*NL*
full
courses
.

Chapter
22
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bennets
were
engaged
to
dine
with
the
Lucases
and
again
during
the
*NL*
chief
of
the
day
was
Miss
Lucas
so
kind
as
to
listen
to
Mr.
Collins
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
took
an
opportunity
of
thanking
her
.
``
It
keeps
him
in
good
*NL*
humour
,
''
said
she
,
``
and
I
am
more
obliged
to
you
than
I
can
express
.
''
*NL*
Charlotte
assured
her
friend
of
her
satisfaction
in
being
useful
,
and
*NL*
that
it
amply
repaid
her
for
the
little
sacrifice
of
her
time
.
This
was
*NL*
very
amiable
,
but
Charlotte
's
kindness
extended
farther
than
Elizabeth
*NL*
had
any
conception
of
;
its
object
was
nothing
else
than
to
secure
her
*NL*
from
any
return
of
Mr.
Collins
's
addresses
,
by
engaging
them
towards
*NL*
herself
.
Such
was
Miss
Lucas
's
scheme
;
and
appearances
were
so
*NL*
favourable
,
that
when
they
parted
at
night
,
she
would
have
felt
almost
*NL*
secure
of
success
if
he
had
not
been
to
leave
Hertfordshire
so
very
*NL*
soon
.
But
here
she
did
injustice
to
the
fire
and
independence
of
his
*NL*
character
,
for
it
led
him
to
escape
out
of
Longbourn
House
the
next
*NL*
morning
with
admirable
slyness
,
and
hasten
to
Lucas
Lodge
to
throw
*NL*
himself
at
her
feet
.
He
was
anxious
to
avoid
the
notice
of
his
cousins
,
*NL*
from
a
conviction
that
if
they
saw
him
depart
,
they
could
not
fail
to
*NL*
conjecture
his
design
,
and
he
was
not
willing
to
have
the
attempt
known
*NL*
till
its
success
might
be
known
likewise
;
for
though
feeling
almost
*NL*
secure
,
and
with
reason
,
for
Charlotte
had
been
tolerably
encouraging
,
*NL*
he
was
comparatively
diffident
since
the
adventure
of
Wednesday
.
*NL*
His
reception
,
however
,
was
of
the
most
flattering
kind
.
Miss
Lucas
*NL*
perceived
him
from
an
upper
window
as
he
walked
towards
the
house
,
and
*NL*
instantly
set
out
to
meet
him
accidentally
in
the
lane
.
But
little
had
*NL*
she
dared
to
hope
that
so
much
love
and
eloquence
awaited
her
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
as
short
a
time
as
Mr.
Collins
's
long
speeches
would
allow
,
*NL*
everything
was
settled
between
them
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
;
and
as
*NL*
they
entered
the
house
he
earnestly
entreated
her
to
name
the
day
that
*NL*
was
to
make
him
the
happiest
of
men
;
and
though
such
a
solicitation
must
*NL*
be
waived
for
the
present
,
the
lady
felt
no
inclination
to
trifle
with
*NL*
his
happiness
.
The
stupidity
with
which
he
was
favoured
by
nature
must
*NL*
guard
his
courtship
from
any
charm
that
could
make
a
woman
wish
for
its
*NL*
continuance
;
and
Miss
Lucas
,
who
accepted
him
solely
from
the
pure
*NL*
and
disinterested
desire
of
an
establishment
,
cared
not
how
soon
that
*NL*
establishment
were
gained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
William
and
Lady
Lucas
were
speedily
applied
to
for
their
consent
;
*NL*
and
it
was
bestowed
with
a
most
joyful
alacrity
.
Mr.
Collins
's
present
*NL*
circumstances
made
it
a
most
eligible
match
for
their
daughter
,
to
whom
*NL*
they
could
give
little
fortune
;
and
his
prospects
of
future
wealth
were
*NL*
exceedingly
fair
.
Lady
Lucas
began
directly
to
calculate
,
with
more
*NL*
interest
than
the
matter
had
ever
excited
before
,
how
many
years
longer
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
was
likely
to
live
;
and
Sir
William
gave
it
as
his
decided
*NL*
opinion
,
that
whenever
Mr.
Collins
should
be
in
possession
of
the
*NL*
Longbourn
estate
,
it
would
be
highly
expedient
that
both
he
and
his
wife
*NL*
should
make
their
appearance
at
St.
James
's
.
The
whole
family
,
in
short
,
*NL*
were
properly
overjoyed
on
the
occasion
.
The
younger
girls
formed
hopes
*NL*
of
_
coming
out
_
a
year
or
two
sooner
than
they
might
otherwise
have
*NL*
done
;
and
the
boys
were
relieved
from
their
apprehension
of
Charlotte
's
*NL*
dying
an
old
maid
.
Charlotte
herself
was
tolerably
composed
.
She
had
*NL*
gained
her
point
,
and
had
time
to
consider
of
it
.
Her
reflections
were
*NL*
in
general
satisfactory
.
Mr.
Collins
,
to
be
sure
,
was
neither
sensible
*NL*
nor
agreeable
;
his
society
was
irksome
,
and
his
attachment
to
her
must
*NL*
be
imaginary
.
But
still
he
would
be
her
husband
.
Without
thinking
highly
*NL*
either
of
men
or
matrimony
,
marriage
had
always
been
her
object
;
it
was
*NL*
the
only
provision
for
well-educated
young
women
of
small
fortune
,
*NL*
and
however
uncertain
of
giving
happiness
,
must
be
their
pleasantest
*NL*
preservative
from
want
.
This
preservative
she
had
now
obtained
;
and
at
*NL*
the
age
of
twenty-seven
,
without
having
ever
been
handsome
,
she
felt
all
*NL*
the
good
luck
of
it
.
The
least
agreeable
circumstance
in
the
business
*NL*
was
the
surprise
it
must
occasion
to
Elizabeth
Bennet
,
whose
friendship
*NL*
she
valued
beyond
that
of
any
other
person
.
Elizabeth
would
wonder
,
*NL*
and
probably
would
blame
her
;
and
though
her
resolution
was
not
to
be
*NL*
shaken
,
her
feelings
must
be
hurt
by
such
a
disapprobation
.
She
resolved
*NL*
to
give
her
the
information
herself
,
and
therefore
charged
Mr.
Collins
,
*NL*
when
he
returned
to
Longbourn
to
dinner
,
to
drop
no
hint
of
what
had
*NL*
passed
before
any
of
the
family
.
A
promise
of
secrecy
was
of
course
very
*NL*
dutifully
given
,
but
it
could
not
be
kept
without
difficulty
;
for
the
*NL*
curiosity
excited
by
his
long
absence
burst
forth
in
such
very
direct
*NL*
questions
on
his
return
as
required
some
ingenuity
to
evade
,
and
he
was
*NL*
at
the
same
time
exercising
great
self-denial
,
for
he
was
longing
to
*NL*
publish
his
prosperous
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
to
begin
his
journey
too
early
on
the
morrow
to
see
any
of
the
*NL*
family
,
the
ceremony
of
leave-taking
was
performed
when
the
ladies
moved
*NL*
for
the
night
;
and
Mrs.
Bennet
,
with
great
politeness
and
cordiality
,
*NL*
said
how
happy
they
should
be
to
see
him
at
Longbourn
again
,
whenever
*NL*
his
engagements
might
allow
him
to
visit
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
madam
,
''
he
replied
,
``
this
invitation
is
particularly
*NL*
gratifying
,
because
it
is
what
I
have
been
hoping
to
receive
;
and
*NL*
you
may
be
very
certain
that
I
shall
avail
myself
of
it
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
astonished
;
and
Mr.
Bennet
,
who
could
by
no
means
wish
for
*NL*
so
speedy
a
return
,
immediately
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
there
not
danger
of
Lady
Catherine
's
disapprobation
here
,
my
*NL*
good
sir
?
You
had
better
neglect
your
relations
than
run
the
risk
of
*NL*
offending
your
patroness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
sir
,
''
replied
Mr.
Collins
,
``
I
am
particularly
obliged
to
you
*NL*
for
this
friendly
caution
,
and
you
may
depend
upon
my
not
taking
so
*NL*
material
a
step
without
her
ladyship
's
concurrence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
be
too
much
upon
your
guard
.
Risk
anything
rather
than
her
*NL*
displeasure
;
and
if
you
find
it
likely
to
be
raised
by
your
coming
to
us
*NL*
again
,
which
I
should
think
exceedingly
probable
,
stay
quietly
at
home
,
*NL*
and
be
satisfied
that
_
we
_
shall
take
no
offence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
my
dear
sir
,
my
gratitude
is
warmly
excited
by
such
*NL*
affectionate
attention
;
and
depend
upon
it
,
you
will
speedily
receive
*NL*
from
me
a
letter
of
thanks
for
this
,
and
for
every
other
mark
of
your
*NL*
regard
during
my
stay
in
Hertfordshire
.
As
for
my
fair
cousins
,
though
*NL*
my
absence
may
not
be
long
enough
to
render
it
necessary
,
I
shall
now
*NL*
take
the
liberty
of
wishing
them
health
and
happiness
,
not
excepting
my
*NL*
cousin
Elizabeth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
proper
civilities
the
ladies
then
withdrew
;
all
of
them
equally
*NL*
surprised
that
he
meditated
a
quick
return
.
Mrs.
Bennet
wished
to
*NL*
understand
by
it
that
he
thought
of
paying
his
addresses
to
one
of
her
*NL*
younger
girls
,
and
Mary
might
have
been
prevailed
on
to
accept
him
.
*NL*
She
rated
his
abilities
much
higher
than
any
of
the
others
;
there
was
*NL*
a
solidity
in
his
reflections
which
often
struck
her
,
and
though
by
no
*NL*
means
so
clever
as
herself
,
she
thought
that
if
encouraged
to
read
*NL*
and
improve
himself
by
such
an
example
as
hers
,
he
might
become
a
very
*NL*
agreeable
companion
.
But
on
the
following
morning
,
every
hope
of
this
*NL*
kind
was
done
away
.
Miss
Lucas
called
soon
after
breakfast
,
and
in
a
*NL*
private
conference
with
Elizabeth
related
the
event
of
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
possibility
of
Mr.
Collins
's
fancying
himself
in
love
with
her
*NL*
friend
had
once
occurred
to
Elizabeth
within
the
last
day
or
two
;
but
*NL*
that
Charlotte
could
encourage
him
seemed
almost
as
far
from
*NL*
possibility
as
she
could
encourage
him
herself
,
and
her
astonishment
was
*NL*
consequently
so
great
as
to
overcome
at
first
the
bounds
of
decorum
,
and
*NL*
she
could
not
help
crying
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Engaged
to
Mr.
Collins
!
My
dear
Charlotte
--
impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
steady
countenance
which
Miss
Lucas
had
commanded
in
telling
her
*NL*
story
,
gave
way
to
a
momentary
confusion
here
on
receiving
so
direct
a
*NL*
reproach
;
though
,
as
it
was
no
more
than
she
expected
,
she
soon
regained
*NL*
her
composure
,
and
calmly
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
be
surprised
,
my
dear
Eliza
?
Do
you
think
it
incredible
*NL*
that
Mr.
Collins
should
be
able
to
procure
any
woman
's
good
opinion
,
*NL*
because
he
was
not
so
happy
as
to
succeed
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Elizabeth
had
now
recollected
herself
,
and
making
a
strong
effort
*NL*
for
it
,
was
able
to
assure
with
tolerable
firmness
that
the
prospect
of
*NL*
their
relationship
was
highly
grateful
to
her
,
and
that
she
wished
her
*NL*
all
imaginable
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
what
you
are
feeling
,
''
replied
Charlotte
.
``
You
must
be
surprised
,
*NL*
very
much
surprised
--
so
lately
as
Mr.
Collins
was
wishing
to
marry
*NL*
you
.
But
when
you
have
had
time
to
think
it
over
,
I
hope
you
will
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
what
I
have
done
.
I
am
not
romantic
,
you
know
;
I
never
*NL*
was
.
I
ask
only
a
comfortable
home
;
and
considering
Mr.
Collins
's
*NL*
character
,
connection
,
and
situation
in
life
,
I
am
convinced
that
my
*NL*
chance
of
happiness
with
him
is
as
fair
as
most
people
can
boast
on
*NL*
entering
the
marriage
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
quietly
answered
``
Undoubtedly
;
''
and
after
an
awkward
pause
,
*NL*
they
returned
to
the
rest
of
the
family
.
Charlotte
did
not
stay
much
*NL*
longer
,
and
Elizabeth
was
then
left
to
reflect
on
what
she
had
heard
.
*NL*
It
was
a
long
time
before
she
became
at
all
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
so
*NL*
unsuitable
a
match
.
The
strangeness
of
Mr.
Collins
's
making
two
offers
*NL*
of
marriage
within
three
days
was
nothing
in
comparison
of
his
being
now
*NL*
accepted
.
She
had
always
felt
that
Charlotte
's
opinion
of
matrimony
was
*NL*
not
exactly
like
her
own
,
but
she
had
not
supposed
it
to
be
possible
*NL*
that
,
when
called
into
action
,
she
would
have
sacrificed
every
better
*NL*
feeling
to
worldly
advantage
.
Charlotte
the
wife
of
Mr.
Collins
was
a
*NL*
most
humiliating
picture
!
And
to
the
pang
of
a
friend
disgracing
herself
*NL*
and
sunk
in
her
esteem
,
was
added
the
distressing
conviction
that
it
*NL*
was
impossible
for
that
friend
to
be
tolerably
happy
in
the
lot
she
had
*NL*
chosen
.

*NL*
Chapter
23
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
sitting
with
her
mother
and
sisters
,
reflecting
on
what
*NL*
she
had
heard
,
and
doubting
whether
she
was
authorised
to
mention
*NL*
it
,
when
Sir
William
Lucas
himself
appeared
,
sent
by
his
daughter
,
to
*NL*
announce
her
engagement
to
the
family
.
With
many
compliments
to
them
,
*NL*
and
much
self-gratulation
on
the
prospect
of
a
connection
between
the
*NL*
houses
,
he
unfolded
the
matter
--
to
an
audience
not
merely
wondering
,
but
*NL*
incredulous
;
for
Mrs.
Bennet
,
with
more
perseverance
than
politeness
,
*NL*
protested
he
must
be
entirely
mistaken
;
and
Lydia
,
always
unguarded
and
*NL*
often
uncivil
,
boisterously
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
Sir
William
,
how
can
you
tell
such
a
story
?
Do
not
you
know
*NL*
that
Mr.
Collins
wants
to
marry
Lizzy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
less
than
the
complaisance
of
a
courtier
could
have
borne
*NL*
without
anger
such
treatment
;
but
Sir
William
's
good
breeding
carried
*NL*
him
through
it
all
;
and
though
he
begged
leave
to
be
positive
as
to
the
*NL*
truth
of
his
information
,
he
listened
to
all
their
impertinence
with
the
*NL*
most
forbearing
courtesy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
feeling
it
incumbent
on
her
to
relieve
him
from
so
unpleasant
*NL*
a
situation
,
now
put
herself
forward
to
confirm
his
account
,
by
*NL*
mentioning
her
prior
knowledge
of
it
from
Charlotte
herself
;
and
*NL*
endeavoured
to
put
a
stop
to
the
exclamations
of
her
mother
and
sisters
*NL*
by
the
earnestness
of
her
congratulations
to
Sir
William
,
in
which
she
*NL*
was
readily
joined
by
Jane
,
and
by
making
a
variety
of
remarks
on
the
*NL*
happiness
that
might
be
expected
from
the
match
,
the
excellent
character
*NL*
of
Mr.
Collins
,
and
the
convenient
distance
of
Hunsford
from
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
was
in
fact
too
much
overpowered
to
say
a
great
deal
while
*NL*
Sir
William
remained
;
but
no
sooner
had
he
left
them
than
her
feelings
*NL*
found
a
rapid
vent
.
In
the
first
place
,
she
persisted
in
disbelieving
*NL*
the
whole
of
the
matter
;
secondly
,
she
was
very
sure
that
Mr.
Collins
*NL*
had
been
taken
in
;
thirdly
,
she
trusted
that
they
would
never
be
*NL*
happy
together
;
and
fourthly
,
that
the
match
might
be
broken
off
.
Two
*NL*
inferences
,
however
,
were
plainly
deduced
from
the
whole
:
one
,
that
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
the
real
cause
of
the
mischief
;
and
the
other
that
she
*NL*
herself
had
been
barbarously
misused
by
them
all
;
and
on
these
two
*NL*
points
she
principally
dwelt
during
the
rest
of
the
day
.
Nothing
could
*NL*
console
and
nothing
could
appease
her
.
Nor
did
that
day
wear
out
her
*NL*
resentment
.
A
week
elapsed
before
she
could
see
Elizabeth
without
*NL*
scolding
her
,
a
month
passed
away
before
she
could
speak
to
Sir
William
*NL*
or
Lady
Lucas
without
being
rude
,
and
many
months
were
gone
before
she
*NL*
could
at
all
forgive
their
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
's
emotions
were
much
more
tranquil
on
the
occasion
,
and
such
*NL*
as
he
did
experience
he
pronounced
to
be
of
a
most
agreeable
sort
;
for
*NL*
it
gratified
him
,
he
said
,
to
discover
that
Charlotte
Lucas
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
been
used
to
think
tolerably
sensible
,
was
as
foolish
as
his
wife
,
and
*NL*
more
foolish
than
his
daughter
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
confessed
herself
a
little
surprised
at
the
match
;
but
she
said
*NL*
less
of
her
astonishment
than
of
her
earnest
desire
for
their
happiness
;
*NL*
nor
could
Elizabeth
persuade
her
to
consider
it
as
improbable
.
Kitty
*NL*
and
Lydia
were
far
from
envying
Miss
Lucas
,
for
Mr.
Collins
was
only
a
*NL*
clergyman
;
and
it
affected
them
in
no
other
way
than
as
a
piece
of
news
*NL*
to
spread
at
Meryton
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Lucas
could
not
be
insensible
of
triumph
on
being
able
to
retort
*NL*
on
Mrs.
Bennet
the
comfort
of
having
a
daughter
well
married
;
and
she
*NL*
called
at
Longbourn
rather
oftener
than
usual
to
say
how
happy
she
was
,
*NL*
though
Mrs.
Bennet
's
sour
looks
and
ill-natured
remarks
might
have
been
*NL*
enough
to
drive
happiness
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
Elizabeth
and
Charlotte
there
was
a
restraint
which
kept
them
*NL*
mutually
silent
on
the
subject
;
and
Elizabeth
felt
persuaded
that
*NL*
no
real
confidence
could
ever
subsist
between
them
again
.
Her
*NL*
disappointment
in
Charlotte
made
her
turn
with
fonder
regard
to
her
*NL*
sister
,
of
whose
rectitude
and
delicacy
she
was
sure
her
opinion
could
*NL*
never
be
shaken
,
and
for
whose
happiness
she
grew
daily
more
anxious
,
*NL*
as
Bingley
had
now
been
gone
a
week
and
nothing
more
was
heard
of
his
*NL*
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
had
sent
Caroline
an
early
answer
to
her
letter
,
and
was
counting
*NL*
the
days
till
she
might
reasonably
hope
to
hear
again
.
The
promised
*NL*
letter
of
thanks
from
Mr.
Collins
arrived
on
Tuesday
,
addressed
to
*NL*
their
father
,
and
written
with
all
the
solemnity
of
gratitude
which
a
*NL*
twelvemonth
's
abode
in
the
family
might
have
prompted
.
After
discharging
*NL*
his
conscience
on
that
head
,
he
proceeded
to
inform
them
,
with
many
*NL*
rapturous
expressions
,
of
his
happiness
in
having
obtained
the
affection
*NL*
of
their
amiable
neighbour
,
Miss
Lucas
,
and
then
explained
that
it
was
*NL*
merely
with
the
view
of
enjoying
her
society
that
he
had
been
so
ready
*NL*
to
close
with
their
kind
wish
of
seeing
him
again
at
Longbourn
,
whither
*NL*
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
return
on
Monday
fortnight
;
for
Lady
Catherine
,
*NL*
he
added
,
so
heartily
approved
his
marriage
,
that
she
wished
it
to
take
*NL*
place
as
soon
as
possible
,
which
he
trusted
would
be
an
unanswerable
*NL*
argument
with
his
amiable
Charlotte
to
name
an
early
day
for
making
him
*NL*
the
happiest
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
's
return
into
Hertfordshire
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
*NL*
pleasure
to
Mrs.
Bennet
.
On
the
contrary
,
she
was
as
much
disposed
to
*NL*
complain
of
it
as
her
husband
.
It
was
very
strange
that
he
should
come
*NL*
to
Longbourn
instead
of
to
Lucas
Lodge
;
it
was
also
very
inconvenient
*NL*
and
exceedingly
troublesome
.
She
hated
having
visitors
in
the
house
*NL*
while
her
health
was
so
indifferent
,
and
lovers
were
of
all
people
the
*NL*
most
disagreeable
.
Such
were
the
gentle
murmurs
of
Mrs.
Bennet
,
and
*NL*
they
gave
way
only
to
the
greater
distress
of
Mr.
Bingley
's
continued
*NL*
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
Jane
nor
Elizabeth
were
comfortable
on
this
subject
.
Day
after
*NL*
day
passed
away
without
bringing
any
other
tidings
of
him
than
the
*NL*
report
which
shortly
prevailed
in
Meryton
of
his
coming
no
more
to
*NL*
Netherfield
the
whole
winter
;
a
report
which
highly
incensed
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
,
and
which
she
never
failed
to
contradict
as
a
most
scandalous
*NL*
falsehood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Elizabeth
began
to
fear
--
not
that
Bingley
was
indifferent
--
but
that
*NL*
his
sisters
would
be
successful
in
keeping
him
away
.
Unwilling
as
*NL*
she
was
to
admit
an
idea
so
destructive
of
Jane
's
happiness
,
and
so
*NL*
dishonorable
to
the
stability
of
her
lover
,
she
could
not
prevent
its
*NL*
frequently
occurring
.
The
united
efforts
of
his
two
unfeeling
sisters
*NL*
and
of
his
overpowering
friend
,
assisted
by
the
attractions
of
Miss
*NL*
Darcy
and
the
amusements
of
London
might
be
too
much
,
she
feared
,
for
*NL*
the
strength
of
his
attachment
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Jane
,
_
her
_
anxiety
under
this
suspense
was
,
of
course
,
more
*NL*
painful
than
Elizabeth
's
,
but
whatever
she
felt
she
was
desirous
of
*NL*
concealing
,
and
between
herself
and
Elizabeth
,
therefore
,
the
subject
*NL*
was
never
alluded
to
.
But
as
no
such
delicacy
restrained
her
mother
,
*NL*
an
hour
seldom
passed
in
which
she
did
not
talk
of
Bingley
,
express
her
*NL*
impatience
for
his
arrival
,
or
even
require
Jane
to
confess
that
if
he
*NL*
did
not
come
back
she
would
think
herself
very
ill
used
.
It
needed
*NL*
all
Jane
's
steady
mildness
to
bear
these
attacks
with
tolerable
*NL*
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
returned
most
punctually
on
Monday
fortnight
,
but
his
*NL*
reception
at
Longbourn
was
not
quite
so
gracious
as
it
had
been
on
his
*NL*
first
introduction
.
He
was
too
happy
,
however
,
to
need
much
attention
;
*NL*
and
luckily
for
the
others
,
the
business
of
love-making
relieved
them
*NL*
from
a
great
deal
of
his
company
.
The
chief
of
every
day
was
spent
by
*NL*
him
at
Lucas
Lodge
,
and
he
sometimes
returned
to
Longbourn
only
in
time
*NL*
to
make
an
apology
for
his
absence
before
the
family
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
was
really
in
a
most
pitiable
state
.
The
very
mention
of
*NL*
anything
concerning
the
match
threw
her
into
an
agony
of
ill-humour
,
*NL*
and
wherever
she
went
she
was
sure
of
hearing
it
talked
of
.
The
sight
*NL*
of
Miss
Lucas
was
odious
to
her
.
As
her
successor
in
that
house
,
she
*NL*
regarded
her
with
jealous
abhorrence
.
Whenever
Charlotte
came
to
see
*NL*
them
,
she
concluded
her
to
be
anticipating
the
hour
of
possession
;
and
*NL*
whenever
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
Mr.
Collins
,
was
convinced
that
*NL*
they
were
talking
of
the
Longbourn
estate
,
and
resolving
to
turn
herself
*NL*
and
her
daughters
out
of
the
house
,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Bennet
were
dead
.
She
*NL*
complained
bitterly
of
all
this
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Mr.
Bennet
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
is
very
hard
to
think
that
Charlotte
*NL*
Lucas
should
ever
be
mistress
of
this
house
,
that
I
should
be
forced
to
*NL*
make
way
for
_
her
_
,
and
live
to
see
her
take
her
place
in
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
do
not
give
way
to
such
gloomy
thoughts
.
Let
us
hope
for
*NL*
better
things
.
Let
us
flatter
ourselves
that
I
may
be
the
survivor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
very
consoling
to
Mrs.
Bennet
,
and
therefore
,
instead
of
*NL*
making
any
answer
,
she
went
on
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
bear
to
think
that
they
should
have
all
this
estate
.
If
it
was
*NL*
not
for
the
entail
,
I
should
not
mind
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
not
you
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
mind
anything
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
be
thankful
that
you
are
preserved
from
a
state
of
such
*NL*
insensibility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
can
be
thankful
,
Mr.
Bennet
,
for
anything
about
the
entail
.
How
*NL*
anyone
could
have
the
conscience
to
entail
away
an
estate
from
one
's
own
*NL*
daughters
,
I
can
not
understand
;
and
all
for
the
sake
of
Mr.
Collins
too
!
*NL*
Why
should
_
he
_
have
it
more
than
anybody
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
leave
it
to
yourself
to
determine
,

said
Mr.
Bennet
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
's
letter
arrived
,
and
put
an
end
to
doubt
.
The
very
first
*NL*
sentence
conveyed
the
assurance
of
their
being
all
settled
in
London
for
*NL*
the
winter
,
and
concluded
with
her
brother
's
regret
at
not
having
had
*NL*
time
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
friends
in
Hertfordshire
before
he
left
*NL*
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hope
was
over
,
entirely
over
;
and
when
Jane
could
attend
to
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
letter
,
she
found
little
,
except
the
professed
affection
of
the
*NL*
writer
,
that
could
give
her
any
comfort
.
Miss
Darcy
's
praise
occupied
*NL*
the
chief
of
it
.
Her
many
attractions
were
again
dwelt
on
,
and
Caroline
*NL*
boasted
joyfully
of
their
increasing
intimacy
,
and
ventured
to
predict
*NL*
the
accomplishment
of
the
wishes
which
had
been
unfolded
in
her
former
*NL*
letter
.
She
wrote
also
with
great
pleasure
of
her
brother
's
being
an
*NL*
inmate
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
house
,
and
mentioned
with
raptures
some
plans
of
*NL*
the
latter
with
regard
to
new
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
to
whom
Jane
very
soon
communicated
the
chief
of
all
this
,
*NL*
heard
it
in
silent
indignation
.
Her
heart
was
divided
between
concern
*NL*
for
her
sister
,
and
resentment
against
all
others
.
To
Caroline
's
*NL*
assertion
of
her
brother
's
being
partial
to
Miss
Darcy
she
paid
no
*NL*
credit
.
That
he
was
really
fond
of
Jane
,
she
doubted
no
more
than
she
*NL*
had
ever
done
;
and
much
as
she
had
always
been
disposed
to
like
him
,
she
*NL*
could
not
think
without
anger
,
hardly
without
contempt
,
on
that
easiness
*NL*
of
temper
,
that
want
of
proper
resolution
,
which
now
made
him
the
slave
*NL*
of
his
designing
friends
,
and
led
him
to
sacrifice
of
his
own
happiness
*NL*
to
the
caprice
of
their
inclination
.
Had
his
own
happiness
,
however
,
*NL*
been
the
only
sacrifice
,
he
might
have
been
allowed
to
sport
with
it
in
*NL*
whatever
manner
he
thought
best
,
but
her
sister
's
was
involved
in
it
,
as
*NL*
she
thought
he
must
be
sensible
himself
.
It
was
a
subject
,
in
short
,
*NL*
on
which
reflection
would
be
long
indulged
,
and
must
be
unavailing
.
She
*NL*
could
think
of
nothing
else
;
and
yet
whether
Bingley
's
regard
had
really
*NL*
died
away
,
or
were
suppressed
by
his
friends
'
interference
;
whether
*NL*
he
had
been
aware
of
Jane
's
attachment
,
or
whether
it
had
escaped
his
*NL*
observation
;
whatever
were
the
case
,
though
her
opinion
of
him
must
be
*NL*
materially
affected
by
the
difference
,
her
sister
's
situation
remained
*NL*
the
same
,
her
peace
equally
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
day
or
two
passed
before
Jane
had
courage
to
speak
of
her
feelings
to
*NL*
Elizabeth
;
but
at
last
,
on
Mrs.
Bennet
's
leaving
them
together
,
after
a
*NL*
longer
irritation
than
usual
about
Netherfield
and
its
master
,
she
could
*NL*
not
help
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
my
dear
mother
had
more
command
over
herself
!
She
can
have
no
*NL*
idea
of
the
pain
she
gives
me
by
her
continual
reflections
on
him
.
But
*NL*
I
will
not
repine
.
It
can
not
last
long
.
He
will
be
forgot
,
and
we
shall
*NL*
all
be
as
we
were
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
looked
at
her
sister
with
incredulous
solicitude
,
but
said
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
doubt
me
,
''
cried
Jane
,
slightly
colouring
;
``
indeed
,
you
have
*NL*
no
reason
.
He
may
live
in
my
memory
as
the
most
amiable
man
of
my
*NL*
acquaintance
,
but
that
is
all
.
I
have
nothing
either
to
hope
or
fear
,
*NL*
and
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
.
Thank
God
!
I
have
not
_
that
_
pain
.
A
*NL*
little
time
,
therefore
--
I
shall
certainly
try
to
get
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
stronger
voice
she
soon
added
,
``
I
have
this
comfort
immediately
,
*NL*
that
it
has
not
been
more
than
an
error
of
fancy
on
my
side
,
and
that
it
*NL*
has
done
no
harm
to
anyone
but
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Jane
!
''
exclaimed
Elizabeth
,
``
you
are
too
good
.
Your
sweetness
*NL*
and
disinterestedness
are
really
angelic
;
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
*NL*
to
you
.
I
feel
as
if
I
had
never
done
you
justice
,
or
loved
you
as
you
*NL*
deserve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bennet
eagerly
disclaimed
all
extraordinary
merit
,
and
threw
back
*NL*
the
praise
on
her
sister
's
warm
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
this
is
not
fair
.
_
You
_
wish
to
think
all
the
*NL*
world
respectable
,
and
are
hurt
if
I
speak
ill
of
anybody
.
I
only
want
*NL*
to
think
_
you
_
perfect
,
and
you
set
yourself
against
it
.
Do
not
*NL*
be
afraid
of
my
running
into
any
excess
,
of
my
encroaching
on
your
*NL*
privilege
of
universal
good-will
.
You
need
not
.
There
are
few
people
*NL*
whom
I
really
love
,
and
still
fewer
of
whom
I
think
well
.
The
more
I
see
*NL*
of
the
world
,
the
more
am
I
dissatisfied
with
it
;
and
every
day
confirms
*NL*
my
belief
of
the
inconsistency
of
all
human
characters
,
and
of
the
*NL*
little
dependence
that
can
be
placed
on
the
appearance
of
merit
or
*NL*
sense
.
I
have
met
with
two
instances
lately
,
one
I
will
not
mention
;
the
*NL*
other
is
Charlotte
's
marriage
.
It
is
unaccountable
!
In
every
view
it
is
*NL*
unaccountable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Lizzy
,
do
not
give
way
to
such
feelings
as
these
.
They
will
*NL*
ruin
your
happiness
.
You
do
not
make
allowance
enough
for
difference
*NL*
of
situation
and
temper
.
Consider
Mr.
Collins
's
respectability
,
and
*NL*
Charlotte
's
steady
,
prudent
character
.
Remember
that
she
is
one
of
a
*NL*
large
family
;
that
as
to
fortune
,
it
is
a
most
eligible
match
;
and
be
*NL*
ready
to
believe
,
for
everybody
's
sake
,
that
she
may
feel
something
like
*NL*
regard
and
esteem
for
our
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
oblige
you
,
I
would
try
to
believe
almost
anything
,
but
no
one
else
*NL*
could
be
benefited
by
such
a
belief
as
this
;
for
were
I
persuaded
that
*NL*
Charlotte
had
any
regard
for
him
,
I
should
only
think
worse
of
her
*NL*
understanding
than
I
now
do
of
her
heart
.
My
dear
Jane
,
Mr.
Collins
is
a
*NL*
conceited
,
pompous
,
narrow-minded
,
silly
man
;
you
know
he
is
,
as
well
as
*NL*
I
do
;
and
you
must
feel
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
the
woman
who
married
him
*NL*
can
not
have
a
proper
way
of
thinking
.
You
shall
not
defend
her
,
though
*NL*
it
is
Charlotte
Lucas
.
You
shall
not
,
for
the
sake
of
one
individual
,
*NL*
change
the
meaning
of
principle
and
integrity
,
nor
endeavour
to
persuade
*NL*
yourself

me
,
that
selfishness
is
prudence
,
and
insensibility
of
*NL*
danger
security
for
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
think
your
language
too
strong
in
speaking
of
both
,
''
replied
*NL*
Jane
;
``
and
I
hope
you
will
be
convinced
of
it
by
seeing
them
happy

together

But
enough
of
this

You
alluded
to
something
else

You
*NL*
mentioned

I
can
not
misunderstand
you

I
entreat
*NL*
you

dear
Lizzy

not
to
pain
me
by
thinking
_
that
person
_
to
blame
,
and
*NL*
saying
your
opinion
of
him
is
sunk
.
We
must
not
be
so
ready
to
fancy
*NL*
ourselves
intentionally
injured
.
We
must
not
expect
a
lively
young
man
*NL*
to
be
always
so
guarded
and
circumspect
.
It
is
very
often
nothing
but
*NL*
our
own
vanity
that
deceives
us
.
Women
fancy
admiration
means
more
than
*NL*
it
does

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
men
take
care
that
they
should

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
designedly
done

they

I
have
no
idea

there
being
so
much
design
in

world

some
persons
imagine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
far
from
attributing
any
part
of
Mr.
Bingley

conduct
to
design
,

*NL*
said
Elizabeth
;
``
but
without
scheming
to
do
wrong
,
or
to
make
others
*NL*
unhappy
,
there
may
be
error
,
and
there
may
be
misery
.
Thoughtlessness
,
*NL*
want
of
attention
to
other
people
's
feelings
,
and
want
of
resolution
,
*NL*
will
do
the
business

do
you
impute
it

persons

esteem

Stop
me

only
wish
his
happiness

if
he
is
attached
to
me
,
no
other
woman
can
*NL*
secure
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
first
position
is
false
.
They
may
wish
many
things
besides
his

happiness
;
they
may
wish
his
increase
of
wealth
and
consequence
;
they
*NL*
may
wish
him
to
marry
a
girl
who
has
all
the
importance
of
money
,
great
*NL*
connections
,
and
pride
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beyond
a
doubt
,
they
_
do
_
wish
him
to
choose
Miss
Darcy
,
''
replied
Jane
;
*NL*
``
but
this
may
be
from
better
feelings
than
you
are
supposing
.
They
have
*NL*
known
her
much
longer
than
they
have
known
me
;
no
wonder
if
they
love
*NL*
her
better
.
But
,
whatever
may
be
their
own
wishes
,
it
is
very
unlikely
*NL*
they
should
have
opposed
their
brother

.
What
sister
would
think
*NL*
herself
at
liberty
to
do
it
,
unless
there
were
something
very
*NL*
objectionable
?
If
they
believed
him
attached
to
me
,
they
would
not
try
*NL*
to
part
us
;
if
he
were
so
,
they
could
not
succeed

By
supposing
such
an
*NL*
affection
,
you
make
everybody
acting
unnaturally
and
wrong
,
and
me
most
*NL*
unhappy

Do
not
distress
me
by
the
idea

I
am
not
ashamed
of
having
been
*NL*
mistaken

or
,
at
least
,
it
is
light
,
it
is
nothing
in
comparison
of
what
*NL*
I
should
feel
in
thinking
ill
of
him
or
his
sisters

Let
me
take
it
in
*NL*
the
best
light

in
the
light
in
which
it
may
be
understood

''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
not
oppose
such
a
wish
;
and
from
this
time
Mr.
Bingley
's
*NL*
name
was
scarcely
ever
mentioned
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
still
continued
to
wonder
and
repine
at
his
returning
no
*NL*
more
,
and
though
a
day
seldom
passed
in
which
Elizabeth
did
not
account
*NL*
for
it
clearly
,
there
was
little
chance
of
her
ever
considering
it
with
*NL*
less
perplexity
.
Her
daughter
endeavoured
to
convince
her
of
what
she
*NL*
did
not
believe
herself
,
that
his
attentions
to
Jane
had
been
merely
the
*NL*
effect
of
a
common
and
transient
liking
,
which
ceased
when
he
saw
her
*NL*
no
more
;
but
though
the
probability
of
the
statement
was
admitted
at
*NL*
the
time
,
she
had
the
same
story
to
repeat
every
day
.
Mrs.
Bennet
's
best
*NL*
comfort
was
that
Mr.
Bingley
must
be
down
again
in
the
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
treated
the
matter
differently
.
``
So
,
Lizzy
,
''
said
he
one
day
,
*NL*
``
your
sister
is
crossed
in
love
,
I
find

I
congratulate
her
.
Next
to
*NL*
being
married
,
a
girl
likes
to
be
crossed
a
little
in
love
now
and
then
.
*NL*
It
is
something
to
think
of
,
and
it
gives
her
a
sort
of
distinction
*NL*
among
her
companions
.
When
is
your
turn
to
come
?
You
will
hardly
bear
to
*NL*
be
long
outdone
by
Jane
.
Now
is
your
time
.
Here
are
officers
enough
in
*NL*
Meryton
to
disappoint
all
the
young
ladies
in
the
country
.
Let
Wickham
*NL*
be
_
your
_
man
.
He
is
a
pleasant
fellow
,
and
would
jilt
you
creditably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
but
a
less
agreeable
man
would
satisfy
me

We
must
not
*NL*
all
expect
Jane
's
good
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
Mr.
Bennet
,
``
but
it
is
a
comfort
to
think
that
whatever
of
*NL*
that
kind
may
befall
you

you
have
an
affectionate
mother
who
will
make
*NL*
the
most

it

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
's
society
was
of
material
service
in
dispelling
the
gloom
*NL*
which
the
late
perverse
occurrences
had
thrown
on
many
of
the
Longbourn
*NL*
family
.
They
saw
him
often
,
and
to
his
other
recommendations
was
now
*NL*
added
that
of
general
unreserve
.
The
whole
of
what
Elizabeth
had
already
*NL*
heard
,
his
claims
on
Mr.
Darcy
,
and
all
that
he
had
suffered
from
him
,
*NL*
was
now
openly
acknowledged
and
publicly
canvassed
;
and
everybody
was
*NL*
pleased
to
know
how
much
they
had
always
disliked
Mr.
Darcy
before
they
*NL*
had
known
anything
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bennet
was
the
only
creature
who
could
suppose
there
might
be
*NL*
any
extenuating
circumstances
in
the
case
,
unknown
to
the
society
*NL*
of
Hertfordshire
;
her
mild
and
steady
candour
always
pleaded
for
*NL*
allowances
,
and
urged
the
possibility
of
mistakes
--
but
by
everybody
else
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
was
condemned
as
the
worst
of
men
.

After
a
week
spent
in
professions
of
love
and
schemes
of
felicity
,
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
was
called
from
his
amiable
Charlotte
by
the
arrival
of
*NL*
Saturday
.
The
pain
of
separation
,
however
,
might
be
alleviated
on
his
*NL*
side
,
by
preparations
for
the
reception
of
his
bride
;
as
he
had
reason
*NL*
to
hope
,
that
shortly
after
his
return
into
Hertfordshire
,
the
day
would
*NL*
be
fixed
that
was
to
make
him
the
happiest
of
men
.
He
took
leave
of
his
*NL*
relations
at
Longbourn
with
as
much
solemnity
as
before
;
wished
his
fair
*NL*
cousins
health
and
happiness
again
,
and
promised
their
father
another
*NL*
letter
of
thanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
Monday
,
Mrs.
Bennet
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
*NL*
her
brother
and
his
wife
,
who
came
as
usual
to
spend
the
Christmas
*NL*
at
Longbourn
.
Mr.
Gardiner
was
a
sensible
,
gentlemanlike
man
,
greatly
*NL*
superior
to
his
sister
,
as
well
by
nature
as
education
.
The
Netherfield
*NL*
ladies
would
have
had
difficulty
in
believing
that
a
man
who
lived
*NL*
by
trade
,
and
within
view
of
his
own
warehouses
,
could
have
been
so
*NL*
well-bred
and
agreeable
.
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
who
was
several
years
younger
*NL*
than
Mrs.
Bennet
and
Mrs.
Phillips
,
was
an
amiable
,
intelligent
,
elegant
*NL*
woman
,
and
a
great
favourite
with
all
her
Longbourn
nieces
.
Between
the
*NL*
two
eldest
and
herself
especially
,
there
subsisted
a
particular
regard
.
*NL*
They
had
frequently
been
staying
with
her
in
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
part
of
Mrs.
Gardiner
's
business
on
her
arrival
was
to
*NL*
distribute
her
presents
and
describe
the
newest
fashions
.
When
this
was
*NL*
done
she
had
a
less
active
part
to
play
.
It
became
her
turn
to
listen
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
had
many
grievances
to
relate
,
and
much
to
complain
of
.
They
*NL*
had
all
been
very
ill-used
since
she
last
saw
her
sister
.
Two
of
her
*NL*
girls
had
been
upon
the
point
of
marriage
,
and
after
all
there
was
*NL*
nothing
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
blame
Jane
,
''
she
continued
,
``
for
Jane
would
have
got
Mr.
*NL*
Bingley
if
she
could
.
But
Lizzy
!
Oh
,
sister
!
It
is
very
hard
to
think
*NL*
that
she
might
have
been
Mr.
Collins
's
wife
by
this
time
,
had
it
not
*NL*
been
for
her
own
perverseness
.
He
made
her
an
offer
in
this
very
room
,
*NL*
and
she
refused
him
.
The
consequence
of
it
is
,
that
Lady
Lucas
will
have
*NL*
a
daughter
married
before
I
have
,
and
that
the
Longbourn
estate
is
just
*NL*
as
much
entailed
as
ever
.
The
Lucases
are
very
artful
people
indeed
,
*NL*
sister
.
They
are
all
for
what
they
can
get
.
I
am
sorry
to
say
it
of
*NL*
them
,
but
so
it
is
.
It
makes
me
very
nervous
and
poorly
,
to
be
thwarted
*NL*
so
in
my
own
family
,
and
to
have
neighbours
who
think
of
themselves
*NL*
before
anybody
else
.
However
,
your
coming
just
at
this
time
is
the
*NL*
greatest
of
comforts
,
and
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
what
you
tell
us
,
of
*NL*
long
sleeves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
to
whom
the
chief
of
this
news
had
been
given
before
,
*NL*
in
the
course
of
Jane
and
Elizabeth
's
correspondence
with
her
,
made
her
*NL*
sister
a
slight
answer
,
and
,
in
compassion
to
her
nieces
,
turned
the
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
alone
with
Elizabeth
afterwards
,
she
spoke
more
on
the
subject
.
``
It
*NL*
seems
likely
to
have
been
a
desirable
match
for
Jane
,
''
said
she
.
``
I
am
*NL*
sorry
it
went
off
.
But
these
things
happen
so
often
!
A
young
man
,
such
*NL*
as
you
describe
Mr.
Bingley
,
so
easily
falls
in
love
with
a
pretty
girl
*NL*
for
a
few
weeks
,
and
when
accident
separates
them
,
so
easily
forgets
*NL*
her
,
that
these
sort
of
inconsistencies
are
very
frequent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
excellent
consolation
in
its
way
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
but
it
will
not
*NL*
do
for
_
us
_
.
We
do
not
suffer
by
_
accident
_
.
It
does
not
often
*NL*
happen
that
the
interference
of
friends
will
persuade
a
young
man
of
*NL*
independent
fortune
to
think
no
more
of
a
girl
whom
he
was
violently
in
*NL*
love
with
only
a
few
days
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
expression
of
`
violently
in
love
'
is
so
hackneyed
,
so
*NL*
doubtful
,
so
indefinite
,
that
it
gives
me
very
little
idea
.
It
is
as
*NL*
often
applied
to
feelings
which
arise
from
a
half-hour
's
acquaintance
,
*NL*
as
to
a
real
,
strong
attachment
.
Pray
,
how
_
violent
was
_
Mr.
Bingley
's
*NL*
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
a
more
promising
inclination
;
he
was
growing
quite
*NL*
inattentive
to
other
people
,
and
wholly
engrossed
by
her
.
Every
time
*NL*
they
met
,
it
was
more
decided
and
remarkable
.
At
his
own
ball
he
*NL*
offended
two
or
three
young
ladies
,
by
not
asking
them
to
dance
;
and
I
*NL*
spoke
to
him
twice
myself
,
without
receiving
an
answer
.
Could
there
be
*NL*
finer
symptoms
?
Is
not
general
incivility
the
very
essence
of
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
--
of
that
kind
of
love
which
I
suppose
him
to
have
felt
.
Poor
*NL*
Jane
!
I
am
sorry
for
her
,
because
,
with
her
disposition
,
she
may
not
get
*NL*
over
it
immediately
.
It
had
better
have
happened
to
_
you
_
,
Lizzy
;
you
*NL*
would
have
laughed
yourself
out
of
it
sooner
.
But
do
you
think
she
*NL*
would
be
prevailed
upon
to
go
back
with
us
?
Change
of
scene
might
be
*NL*
of
service
--
and
perhaps
a
little
relief
from
home
may
be
as
useful
as
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
exceedingly
pleased
with
this
proposal
,
and
felt
persuaded
*NL*
of
her
sister
's
ready
acquiescence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
''
added
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
``
that
no
consideration
with
regard
to
*NL*
this
young
man
will
influence
her
.
We
live
in
so
different
a
part
of
*NL*
town
,
all
our
connections
are
so
different
,
and
,
as
you
well
know
,
we
go
*NL*
out
so
little
,
that
it
is
very
improbable
that
they
should
meet
at
all
,
*NL*
unless
he
really
comes
to
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
_
that
_
is
quite
impossible
;
for
he
is
now
in
the
custody
of
his
*NL*
friend
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
would
no
more
suffer
him
to
call
on
Jane
in
such
*NL*
a
part
of
London
!
My
dear
aunt
,
how
could
you
think
of
it
?
Mr.
Darcy
may
*NL*
perhaps
have
_
heard
_
of
such
a
place
as
Gracechurch
Street
,
but
he
*NL*
would
hardly
think
a
month
's
ablution
enough
to
cleanse
him
from
its
*NL*
impurities
,
were
he
once
to
enter
it
;
and
depend
upon
it
,
Mr.
Bingley
*NL*
never
stirs
without
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
.
I
hope
they
will
not
meet
at
all
.
But
does
not
Jane
*NL*
correspond
with
his
sister
?
_
She
_
will
not
be
able
to
help
calling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
drop
the
acquaintance
entirely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
spite
of
the
certainty
in
which
Elizabeth
affected
to
place
this
*NL*
point
,
as
well
as
the
still
more
interesting
one
of
Bingley
's
being
*NL*
withheld
from
seeing
Jane
,
she
felt
a
solicitude
on
the
subject
which
*NL*
convinced
her
,
on
examination
,
that
she
did
not
consider
it
entirely
*NL*
hopeless
.
It
was
possible
,
and
sometimes
she
thought
it
probable
,
that
*NL*
his
affection
might
be
reanimated
,
and
the
influence
of
his
friends
*NL*
successfully
combated
by
the
more
natural
influence
of
Jane
's
*NL*
attractions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bennet
accepted
her
aunt
's
invitation
with
pleasure
;
and
the
*NL*
Bingleys
were
no
otherwise
in
her
thoughts
at
the
same
time
,
than
as
she
*NL*
hoped
by
Caroline
's
not
living
in
the
same
house
with
her
brother
,
*NL*
she
might
occasionally
spend
a
morning
with
her
,
without
any
danger
of
*NL*
seeing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Gardiners
stayed
a
week
at
Longbourn
;
and
what
with
the
Phillipses
,
*NL*
the
Lucases
,
and
the
officers
,
there
was
not
a
day
without
its
*NL*
engagement
.
Mrs.
Bennet
had
so
carefully
provided
for
the
entertainment
*NL*
of
her
brother
and
sister
,
that
they
did
not
once
sit
down
to
a
family
*NL*
dinner
.
When
the
engagement
was
for
home
,
some
of
the
officers
always
*NL*
made
part
of
it
--
of
which
officers
Mr.
Wickham
was
sure
to
be
one
;
and
*NL*
on
these
occasions
,
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
rendered
suspicious
by
Elizabeth
's
*NL*
warm
commendation
,
narrowly
observed
them
both
.
Without
supposing
them
,
*NL*
from
what
she
saw
,
to
be
very
seriously
in
love
,
their
preference
*NL*
of
each
other
was
plain
enough
to
make
her
a
little
uneasy
;
and
*NL*
she
resolved
to
speak
to
Elizabeth
on
the
subject
before
she
left
*NL*
Hertfordshire
,
and
represent
to
her
the
imprudence
of
encouraging
such
*NL*
an
attachment
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
Wickham
had
one
means
of
affording
pleasure
,
*NL*
unconnected
with
his
general
powers
.
About
ten
or
a
dozen
years
ago
,
*NL*
before
her
marriage
,
she
had
spent
a
considerable
time
in
that
very
*NL*
part
of
Derbyshire
to
which
he
belonged
.
They
had
,
therefore
,
many
*NL*
acquaintances
in
common
;
and
though
Wickham
had
been
little
there
since
*NL*
the
death
of
Darcy
's
father
,
it
was
yet
in
his
power
to
give
her
fresher
*NL*
intelligence
of
her
former
friends
than
she
had
been
in
the
way
of
*NL*
procuring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
had
seen
Pemberley
,
and
known
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
by
*NL*
character
perfectly
well
.
Here
consequently
was
an
inexhaustible
subject
*NL*
of
discourse
.
In
comparing
her
recollection
of
Pemberley
with
the
minute
*NL*
description
which
Wickham
could
give
,
and
in
bestowing
her
tribute
of
*NL*
praise
on
the
character
of
its
late
possessor
,
she
was
delighting
both
*NL*
him
and
herself
.
On
being
made
acquainted
with
the
present
Mr.
Darcy
's
*NL*
treatment
of
him
,
she
tried
to
remember
some
of
that
gentleman
's
*NL*
reputed
disposition
when
quite
a
lad
which
might
agree
with
it
,
and
*NL*
was
confident
at
last
that
she
recollected
having
heard
Mr.
Fitzwilliam
*NL*
Darcy
formerly
spoken
of
as
a
very
proud
,
ill-natured
boy
.

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
's
caution
to
Elizabeth
was
punctually
and
kindly
given
*NL*
on
the
first
favourable
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
alone
;
after
*NL*
honestly
telling
her
what
she
thought
,
she
thus
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
sensible
a
girl
,
Lizzy
,
to
fall
in
love
merely
because
*NL*
you
are
warned
against
it
;
and
,
therefore
,
I
am
not
afraid
of
speaking
*NL*
openly
.
Seriously
,
I
would
have
you
be
on
your
guard
.
Do
not
involve
*NL*
yourself
or
endeavour
to
involve
him
in
an
affection
which
the
want
*NL*
of
fortune
would
make
so
very
imprudent
.
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
*NL*
_
him
_
;
he
is
a
most
interesting
young
man
;
and
if
he
had
the
fortune
he
*NL*
ought
to
have
,
I
should
think
you
could
not
do
better
.
But
as
it
is
,
you
*NL*
must
not
let
your
fancy
run
away
with
you
.
You
have
sense
,
and
we
all
*NL*
expect
you
to
use
it
.
Your
father
would
depend
on
_
your
_
resolution
and
*NL*
good
conduct
,
I
am
sure
.
You
must
not
disappoint
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
aunt
,
this
is
being
serious
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
hope
to
engage
you
to
be
serious
likewise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
you
need
not
be
under
any
alarm
.
I
will
take
care
of
*NL*
myself
,
and
of
Mr.
Wickham
too
.
He
shall
not
be
in
love
with
me
,
if
I
*NL*
can
prevent
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elizabeth
,
you
are
not
serious
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
I
will
try
again
.
At
present
I
am
not
in
love
with
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
;
no
,
I
certainly
am
not
.
But
he
is
,
beyond
all
comparison
,
*NL*
the
most
agreeable
man
I
ever
saw
--
and
if
he
becomes
really
attached
to
*NL*
me
--
I
believe
it
will
be
better
that
he
should
not
.
I
see
the
imprudence
*NL*
of
it
.
Oh
!
_
that
_
abominable
Mr.
Darcy
!
My
father
's
opinion
of
me
does
*NL*
me
the
greatest
honour
,
and
I
should
be
miserable
to
forfeit
it
.
My
*NL*
father
,
however
,
is
partial
to
Mr.
Wickham
.
In
short
,
my
dear
aunt
,
I
*NL*
should
be
very
sorry
to
be
the
means
of
making
any
of
you
unhappy
;
but
*NL*
since
we
see
every
day
that
where
there
is
affection
,
young
people
*NL*
are
seldom
withheld
by
immediate
want
of
fortune
from
entering
into
*NL*
engagements
with
each
other
,
how
can
I
promise
to
be
wiser
than
so
many
*NL*
of
my
fellow-creatures
if
I
am
tempted
,
or
how
am
I
even
to
know
that
it
*NL*
would
be
wisdom
to
resist
?
All
that
I
can
promise
you
,
therefore
,
is
not
*NL*
to
be
in
a
hurry
.
I
will
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
believe
myself
his
first
*NL*
object
.
When
I
am
in
company
with
him
,
I
will
not
be
wishing
.
In
short
,
*NL*
I
will
do
my
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
will
be
as
well
if
you
discourage
his
coming
here
so
very
*NL*
often
.
At
least
,
you
should
not
_
remind
_
your
mother
of
inviting
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
did
the
other
day
,
''
said
Elizabeth
with
a
conscious
smile
:
``
very
*NL*
true
,
it
will
be
wise
in
me
to
refrain
from
_
that
_
.
But
do
not
imagine
*NL*
that
he
is
always
here
so
often
.
It
is
on
your
account
that
he
has
been
*NL*
so
frequently
invited
this
week
.
You
know
my
mother
's
ideas
as
to
the
*NL*
necessity
of
constant
company
for
her
friends
.
But
really
,
and
upon
my
*NL*
honour
,
I
will
try
to
do
what
I
think
to
be
the
wisest
;
and
now
I
hope
*NL*
you
are
satisfied

Her
aunt
assured
her
that
she
was
,
and
Elizabeth
having
thanked
her
for
*NL*
the
kindness
of
her
hints
,
they
parted
;
a
wonderful
instance
of
advice
*NL*
being
given
on
such
a
point
,
without
being
resented

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
returned
into
Hertfordshire
soon
after
it
had
been
quitted
*NL*
by
the
Gardiners
and
Jane
;
but
as
he
took
up
his
abode
with
the
Lucases
,
*NL*
his
arrival
was
no
great
inconvenience
to
Mrs.
Bennet
.
His
marriage
was
*NL*
now
fast
approaching
,
and
she
was
at
length
so
far
resigned
as
to
think
*NL*
it
inevitable
,
and
even
repeatedly
to
say
,
in
an
ill-natured
tone
,
that
*NL*
she
''
_
wished
_
they
might
be
happy
.
''
Thursday
was
to
be
the
wedding
day
,
*NL*
and
on
Wednesday
Miss
Lucas
paid
her
farewell
visit
;
and
when
she
*NL*
rose
to
take
leave
,
Elizabeth
,
ashamed
of
her
mother
's
ungracious
and
*NL*
reluctant
good
wishes
,
and
sincerely
affected
herself
,
accompanied
her
*NL*
out
of
the
room
.
As
they
went
downstairs
together
,
Charlotte
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
depend
on
hearing
from
you
very
often
,
Eliza
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
That
_
you
certainly
shall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
another
favour
to
ask
you
.
Will
you
come
and
see
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
often
meet
,
I
hope
,
in
Hertfordshire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
likely
to
leave
Kent
for
some
time
.
Promise
me
,
therefore
,
to
*NL*
come
to
Hunsford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
not
refuse
,
though
she
foresaw
little
pleasure
in
the
*NL*
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
and
Maria
are
coming
to
me
in
March
,
''
added
Charlotte
,
``
and
I
*NL*
hope
you
will
consent
to
be
of
the
party
.
Indeed
,
Eliza
,
you
will
be
as
*NL*
welcome
as
either
of
them
.
''

The
wedding
took
place
;
the
bride
and
bridegroom
set
off
for
Kent
from
*NL*
the
church
door
,
and
everybody
had
as
much
to
say
,
or
to
hear
,
on
*NL*
the
subject
as
usual
.
Elizabeth
soon
heard
from
her
friend
;
and
their
*NL*
correspondence
was
as
regular
and
frequent
as
it
had
ever
been
;
that
*NL*
it
should
be
equally
unreserved
was
impossible
.
Elizabeth
could
never
*NL*
address
her
without
feeling
that
all
the
comfort
of
intimacy
was
over
,
*NL*
and
though
determined
not
to
slacken
as
a
correspondent
,
it
was
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
what
had
been
,
rather
than
what
was
.
Charlotte
's
first
letters
*NL*
were
received
with
a
good
deal
of
eagerness
;
there
could
not
but
be
*NL*
curiosity
to
know
how
she
would
speak
of
her
new
home
,
how
she
would
*NL*
like
Lady
Catherine
,
and
how
happy
she
would
dare
pronounce
herself
to
*NL*
be
;
though
,
when
the
letters
were
read
,
Elizabeth
felt
that
Charlotte
*NL*
expressed
herself
on
every
point
exactly
as
she
might
have
foreseen
.
She
*NL*
wrote
cheerfully
,
seemed
surrounded
with
comforts
,
and
mentioned
nothing
*NL*
which
she
could
not
praise
.
The
house
,
furniture
,
neighbourhood
,
and
*NL*
roads
,
were
all
to
her
taste
,
and
Lady
Catherine
's
behaviour
was
most
*NL*
friendly
and
obliging
.
It
was
Mr.
Collins
's
picture
of
Hunsford
and
*NL*
Rosings
rationally
softened
;
and
Elizabeth
perceived
that
she
must
wait
*NL*
for
her
own
visit
there
to
know
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
had
already
written
a
few
lines
to
her
sister
to
announce
their
*NL*
safe
arrival
in
London
;
and
when
she
wrote
again
,
Elizabeth
hoped
it
*NL*
would
be
in
her
power
to
say
something
of
the
Bingleys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
impatience
for
this
second
letter
was
as
well
rewarded
as
impatience
*NL*
generally
is
.
Jane
had
been
a
week
in
town
without
either
seeing
or
*NL*
hearing
from
Caroline
.
She
accounted
for
it
,
however
,
by
supposing
that
*NL*
her
last
letter
to
her
friend
from
Longbourn
had
by
some
accident
been
*NL*
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
aunt
,
''
she
continued
,
``
is
going
to-morrow
into
that
part
of
the
*NL*
town
,
and
I
shall
take
the
opportunity
of
calling
in
Grosvenor
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wrote
again
when
the
visit
was
paid
,
and
she
had
seen
Miss
Bingley
.
*NL*
``
I
did
not
think
Caroline
in
spirits
,
''
were
her
words
,
``
but
she
was
very
*NL*
glad
to
see
me
,
and
reproached
me
for
giving
her
no
notice
of
my
coming
*NL*
to
London
.
I
was
right
,
therefore
,
my
last
letter
had
never
reached
*NL*
her
.
I
inquired
after
their
brother
,
of
course
.
He
was
well
,
but
so
much
*NL*
engaged
with
Mr.
Darcy
that
they
scarcely
ever
saw
him
.
I
found
that
*NL*
Miss
Darcy
was
expected
to
dinner
.
I
wish
I
could
see
her
.
My
visit
was
*NL*
not
long
,
as
Caroline
and
Mrs.
Hurst
were
going
out
.
I
dare
say
I
shall
*NL*
see
them
soon
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
shook
her
head
over
this
letter
.
It
convinced
her
that
*NL*
accident
only
could
discover
to
Mr.
Bingley
her
sister
's
being
in
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
weeks
passed
away
,
and
Jane
saw
nothing
of
him
.
She
endeavoured
to
*NL*
persuade
herself
that
she
did
not
regret
it
;
but
she
could
no
longer
be
*NL*
blind
to
Miss
Bingley
's
inattention
.
After
waiting
at
home
every
morning
*NL*
for
a
fortnight
,
and
inventing
every
evening
a
fresh
excuse
for
her
,
the
*NL*
visitor
did
at
last
appear
;
but
the
shortness
of
her
stay
,
and
yet
more
,
*NL*
the
alteration
of
her
manner
would
allow
Jane
to
deceive
herself
no
*NL*
longer
.
The
letter
which
she
wrote
on
this
occasion
to
her
sister
will
*NL*
prove
what
she
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
Lizzy
will
,
I
am
sure
,
be
incapable
of
triumphing
in
her
*NL*
better
judgement
,
at
my
expense
,
when
I
confess
myself
to
have
been
*NL*
entirely
deceived
in
Miss
Bingley
's
regard
for
me
.
But
,
my
dear
sister
,
*NL*
though
the
event
has
proved
you
right
,
do
not
think
me
obstinate
if
I
*NL*
still
assert
that
,
considering
what
her
behaviour
was
,
my
confidence
was
*NL*
as
natural
as
your
suspicion
.
I
do
not
at
all
comprehend
her
reason
for
*NL*
wishing
to
be
intimate
with
me
;
but
if
the
same
circumstances
were
to
*NL*
happen
again
,
I
am
sure
I
should
be
deceived
again
.
Caroline
did
not
*NL*
return
my
visit
till
yesterday
;
and
not
a
note
,
not
a
line
,
did
I
*NL*
receive
in
the
meantime
.
When
she
did
come
,
it
was
very
evident
that
*NL*
she
had
no
pleasure
in
it
;
she
made
a
slight
,
formal
apology
,
for
not
*NL*
calling
before
,
said
not
a
word
of
wishing
to
see
me
again
,
and
was
*NL*
in
every
respect
so
altered
a
creature
,
that
when
she
went
away
I
was
*NL*
perfectly
resolved
to
continue
the
acquaintance
no
longer
.
I
pity
,
*NL*
though
I
can
not
help
blaming
her
.
She
was
very
wrong
in
singling
me
out
*NL*
as
she
did
;
I
can
safely
say
that
every
advance
to
intimacy
began
on
*NL*
her
side
.
But
I
pity
her
,
because
she
must
feel
that
she
has
been
acting
*NL*
wrong
,
and
because
I
am
very
sure
that
anxiety
for
her
brother
is
the
*NL*
cause
of
it
.
I
need
not
explain
myself
farther
;
and
though
_
we
_
know
*NL*
this
anxiety
to
be
quite
needless
,
yet
if
she
feels
it
,
it
will
easily
*NL*
account
for
her
behaviour
to
me
;
and
so
deservedly
dear
as
he
is
to
*NL*
his
sister
,
whatever
anxiety
she
must
feel
on
his
behalf
is
natural
and
*NL*
amiable
.
I
can
not
but
wonder
,
however
,
at
her
having
any
such
fears
now
,
*NL*
because
,
if
he
had
at
all
cared
about
me
,
we
must
have
met
,
long
ago
.
*NL*
He
knows
of
my
being
in
town
,
I
am
certain
,
from
something
she
said
*NL*
herself
;
and
yet
it
would
seem
,
by
her
manner
of
talking
,
as
if
she
*NL*
wanted
to
persuade
herself
that
he
is
really
partial
to
Miss
Darcy
.
I
*NL*
can
not
understand
it
.
If
I
were
not
afraid
of
judging
harshly
,
I
should
*NL*
be
almost
tempted
to
say
that
there
is
a
strong
appearance
of
duplicity
*NL*
in
all
this
.
But
I
will
endeavour
to
banish
every
painful
thought
,
*NL*
and
think
only
of
what
will
make
me
happy
--
your
affection
,
and
the
*NL*
invariable
kindness
of
my
dear
uncle
and
aunt
.
Let
me
hear
from
you
very
*NL*
soon
.
Miss
Bingley
said
something
of
his
never
returning
to
Netherfield
*NL*
again
,
of
giving
up
the
house
,
but
not
with
any
certainty
.
We
had
better
*NL*
not
mention
it
.
I
am
extremely
glad
that
you
have
such
pleasant
accounts
*NL*
from
our
friends
at
Hunsford
.
Pray
go
to
see
them
,
with
Sir
William
and
*NL*
Maria
.
I
am
sure
you
will
be
very
comfortable
there
.
--
Yours
,
etc.

*NL*
This
letter
gave
Elizabeth
some
pain
;
but
her
spirits
returned
as
she
*NL*
considered
that
Jane
would
no
longer
be
duped
,
by
the
sister
at
least
.
*NL*
All
expectation
from
the
brother
was
now
absolutely
over
.
She
would
not
*NL*
even
wish
for
a
renewal
of
his
attentions
.
His
character
sunk
on
*NL*
every
review
of
it
;
and
as
a
punishment
for
him
,
as
well
as
a
possible
*NL*
advantage
to
Jane
,
she
seriously
hoped
he
might
really
soon
marry
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
's
sister
,
as
by
Wickham
's
account
,
she
would
make
him
abundantly
*NL*
regret
what
he
had
thrown
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
about
this
time
reminded
Elizabeth
of
her
promise
*NL*
concerning
that
gentleman
,
and
required
information
;
and
Elizabeth
*NL*
had
such
to
send
as
might
rather
give
contentment
to
her
aunt
than
to
*NL*
herself
.
His
apparent
partiality
had
subsided
,
his
attentions
were
over
,
*NL*
he
was
the
admirer
of
some
one
else
.
Elizabeth
was
watchful
enough
to
*NL*
see
it
all
,
but
she
could
see
it
and
write
of
it
without
material
pain
.
*NL*
Her
heart
had
been
but
slightly
touched
,
and
her
vanity
was
satisfied
*NL*
with
believing
that
_
she
_
would
have
been
his
only
choice
,
had
fortune
*NL*
permitted
it
.
The
sudden
acquisition
of
ten
thousand
pounds
was
the
most
*NL*
remarkable
charm
of
the
young
lady
to
whom
he
was
now
rendering
himself
*NL*
agreeable
;
but
Elizabeth
,
less
clear-sighted
perhaps
in
this
case
than
*NL*
in
Charlotte
's
,
did
not
quarrel
with
him
for
his
wish
of
independence
.
*NL*
Nothing
,
on
the
contrary
,
could
be
more
natural
;
and
while
able
to
*NL*
suppose
that
it
cost
him
a
few
struggles
to
relinquish
her
,
she
was
*NL*
ready
to
allow
it
a
wise
and
desirable
measure
for
both
,
and
could
very
*NL*
sincerely
wish
him
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
acknowledged
to
Mrs.
Gardiner
;
and
after
relating
the
*NL*
circumstances
,
she
thus
went
on
:
``
I
am
now
convinced
,
my
dear
aunt
,
that
*NL*
I
have
never
been
much
in
love
;
for
had
I
really
experienced
that
pure
*NL*
and
elevating
passion
,
I
should
at
present
detest
his
very
name
,
and
*NL*
wish
him
all
manner
of
evil
.
But
my
feelings
are
not
only
cordial
*NL*
towards
_
him
_
;
they
are
even
impartial
towards
Miss
King
.
I
can
not
find
*NL*
out
that
I
hate
her
at
all
,
or
that
I
am
in
the
least
unwilling
to
*NL*
think
her
a
very
good
sort
of
girl
.
There
can
be
no
love
in
all
this
.
My
*NL*
watchfulness
has
been
effectual
;
and
though
I
certainly
should
be
a
more
*NL*
interesting
object
to
all
my
acquaintances
were
I
distractedly
in
love
*NL*
with
him
,
I
can
not
say
that
I
regret
my
comparative
insignificance
.
*NL*
Importance
may
sometimes
be
purchased
too
dearly
.
Kitty
and
Lydia
take
*NL*
his
defection
much
more
to
heart
than
I
do
.
They
are
young
in
the
*NL*
ways
of
the
world
,
and
not
yet
open
to
the
mortifying
conviction
that
*NL*
handsome
young
men
must
have
something
to
live
on
as
well
as
the
plain
.

Chapter
27
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
no
greater
events
than
these
in
the
Longbourn
family
,
and
otherwise
*NL*
diversified
by
little
beyond
the
walks
to
Meryton
,
sometimes
dirty
and
*NL*
sometimes
cold
,
did
January
and
February
pass
away
.
March
was
to
take
*NL*
Elizabeth
to
Hunsford
.
She
had
not
at
first
thought
very
seriously
of
*NL*
going
thither
;
but
Charlotte
,
she
soon
found
,
was
depending
on
the
plan
*NL*
and
she
gradually
learned
to
consider
it
herself
with
greater
pleasure
*NL*
as
well
as
greater
certainty
.
Absence
had
increased
her
desire
of
seeing
*NL*
Charlotte
again
,
and
weakened
her
disgust
of
Mr.
Collins
.
There
*NL*
was
novelty
in
the
scheme
,
and
as
,
with
such
a
mother
and
such
*NL*
uncompanionable
sisters
,
home
could
not
be
faultless
,
a
little
change
*NL*
was
not
unwelcome
for
its
own
sake
.
The
journey
would
moreover
give
her
*NL*
a
peep
at
Jane
;
and
,
in
short
,
as
the
time
drew
near
,
she
would
have
*NL*
been
very
sorry
for
any
delay
.
Everything
,
however
,
went
on
smoothly
,
*NL*
and
was
finally
settled
according
to
Charlotte
's
first
sketch
.
She
was
*NL*
to
accompany
Sir
William
and
his
second
daughter
.
The
improvement
*NL*
of
spending
a
night
in
London
was
added
in
time
,
and
the
plan
became
*NL*
perfect
as
plan
could
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
pain
was
in
leaving
her
father
,
who
would
certainly
miss
her
,
*NL*
and
who
,
when
it
came
to
the
point
,
so
little
liked
her
going
,
that
he
*NL*
told
her
to
write
to
him
,
and
almost
promised
to
answer
her
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farewell
between
herself
and
Mr.
Wickham
was
perfectly
friendly
;
on
*NL*
his
side
even
more
.
His
present
pursuit
could
not
make
him
forget
that
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
been
the
first
to
excite
and
to
deserve
his
attention
,
the
*NL*
first
to
listen
and
to
pity
,
the
first
to
be
admired
;
and
in
his
manner
*NL*
of
bidding
her
adieu
,
wishing
her
every
enjoyment
,
reminding
her
of
*NL*
what
she
was
to
expect
in
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
,
and
trusting
their
*NL*
opinion
of
her
--
their
opinion
of
everybody
--
would
always
coincide
,
there
*NL*
was
a
solicitude
,
an
interest
which
she
felt
must
ever
attach
her
to
*NL*
him
with
a
most
sincere
regard
;
and
she
parted
from
him
convinced
that
,
*NL*
whether
married
or
single
,
he
must
always
be
her
model
of
the
amiable
*NL*
and
pleasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
fellow-travellers
the
next
day
were
not
of
a
kind
to
make
her
*NL*
think
him
less
agreeable
.
Sir
William
Lucas
,
and
his
daughter
Maria
,
a
*NL*
good-humoured
girl
,
but
as
empty-headed
as
himself
,
had
nothing
to
say
*NL*
that
could
be
worth
hearing
,
and
were
listened
to
with
about
as
much
*NL*
delight
as
the
rattle
of
the
chaise
.
Elizabeth
loved
absurdities
,
but
*NL*
she
had
known
Sir
William
's
too
long
.
He
could
tell
her
nothing
new
of
*NL*
the
wonders
of
his
presentation
and
knighthood
;
and
his
civilities
were
*NL*
worn
out
,
like
his
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
journey
of
only
twenty-four
miles
,
and
they
began
it
so
early
*NL*
as
to
be
in
Gracechurch
Street
by
noon
.
As
they
drove
to
Mr.
Gardiner
's
*NL*
door
,
Jane
was
at
a
drawing-room
window
watching
their
arrival
;
when
*NL*
they
entered
the
passage
she
was
there
to
welcome
them
,
and
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
looking
earnestly
in
her
face
,
was
pleased
to
see
it
healthful
and
*NL*
lovely
as
ever
.
On
the
stairs
were
a
troop
of
little
boys
and
girls
,
*NL*
whose
eagerness
for
their
cousin
's
appearance
would
not
allow
them
to
*NL*
wait
in
the
drawing-room
,
and
whose
shyness
,
as
they
had
not
seen
*NL*
her
for
a
twelvemonth
,
prevented
their
coming
lower
.
All
was
joy
and
*NL*
kindness
.
The
day
passed
most
pleasantly
away
;
the
morning
in
bustle
and
*NL*
shopping
,
and
the
evening
at
one
of
the
theatres
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
then
contrived
to
sit
by
her
aunt
.
Their
first
object
was
her
*NL*
sister
;
and
she
was
more
grieved
than
astonished
to
hear
,
in
reply
to
*NL*
her
minute
inquiries
,
that
though
Jane
always
struggled
to
support
her
*NL*
spirits
,
there
were
periods
of
dejection
.
It
was
reasonable
,
however
,
*NL*
to
hope
that
they
would
not
continue
long
.
Mrs.
Gardiner
gave
her
the
*NL*
particulars
also
of
Miss
Bingley
's
visit
in
Gracechurch
Street
,
and
*NL*
repeated
conversations
occurring
at
different
times
between
Jane
and
*NL*
herself
,
which
proved
that
the
former
had
,
from
her
heart
,
given
up
the
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
then
rallied
her
niece
on
Wickham
's
desertion
,
and
*NL*
complimented
her
on
bearing
it
so
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
dear
Elizabeth
,
''
she
added
,
``
what
sort
of
girl
is
Miss
King
?
I
*NL*
should
be
sorry
to
think
our
friend
mercenary

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
my
dear
aunt
,
what
is
the
difference
in
matrimonial
affairs
,
*NL*
between
the
mercenary
and
the
prudent
motive
?
Where
does
discretion
end
,
*NL*
and
avarice
begin
?
Last
Christmas
you
were
afraid
of
his
marrying
me
,
*NL*
because
it
would
be
imprudent
;
and
now
,
because
he
is
trying
to
get
*NL*
a
girl
with
only
ten
thousand
pounds
,
you
want
to
find
out
that
he
is
*NL*
mercenary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
only
tell
me
what
sort
of

is

I
shall
know

what

no

*NL*
``
But
he
paid
her
not
the

her

's
death
*NL*
made
her
mistress
of
this
fortune
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

why
should
he

If
it
were
not
allowable
for
him
to
gain

I
had
no
money
,
what
occasion
could
there
be
for

making
love

a
girl

he
did
not

about

who
was
equally

poor

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
seems
an
indelicacy
in
directing
his

towards
her
*NL*
so
soon
after
this
event

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

``

Elizabeth
,
``

it

*NL*
Before
they
were
separated
by
the
conclusion
of
the
play
,
she
had
the
*NL*
unexpected
happiness
of
an
invitation
to
accompany
her
uncle

aunt
in
*NL*
a
tour
of
pleasure
which
they
proposed
taking
in
the
summer
.

*NL*
``
We
have
not
determined
how
far
it

said
Mrs.

,
*NL*
``

,
perhaps
,
to
the
Lakes

*NL*
*NL*
No
scheme
could
have
been
more
agreeable
to
Elizabeth
,
and
her
*NL*
acceptance
of
the
invitation
was
most
ready
and
grateful
.
``
Oh

my
dear

she
rapturously
cried
,

what
delight

Chapter
28
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Every
object
in
the
next
day
's
journey
was
new
and
interesting
to
*NL*
Elizabeth
;
and
her
spirits
were
in
a
state
of
enjoyment
;
for
she
had
*NL*
seen
her
sister
looking
so
well
as
to
banish
all
fear
for
her
health
,
*NL*
and
the
prospect
of
her
northern
tour
was
a
constant
source
of
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
left
the
high
road
for
the
lane
to
Hunsford
,
every
eye
was
in
*NL*
search
of
the
Parsonage
,
and
every
turning
expected
to
bring
it
in
view
.
*NL*
The
palings
of
Rosings
Park
was
their
boundary
on
one
side
.
Elizabeth
*NL*
smiled
at
the
recollection
of
all
that
she
had
heard
of
its
inhabitants
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
Parsonage
was
discernible
.
The
garden
sloping
to
the
*NL*
road
,
the
house
standing
in
it
,
the
green
pales
,
and
the
laurel
hedge
,
*NL*
everything
declared
they
were
arriving
.
Mr.
Collins
and
Charlotte
*NL*
appeared
at
the
door
,
and
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
small
gate
which
*NL*
led
by
a
short
gravel
walk
to
the
house
,
amidst
the
nods
and
smiles
of
*NL*
the
whole
party
.
In
a
moment
they
were
all
out
of
the
chaise
,
rejoicing
*NL*
at
the
sight
of
each
other
.
Mrs.
Collins
welcomed
her
friend
with
the
*NL*
liveliest
pleasure
,
and
Elizabeth
was
more
and
more
satisfied
with
*NL*
coming
when
she
found
herself
so
affectionately
received
.
She
saw
*NL*
instantly
that
her
cousin
's
manners
were
not
altered
by
his
marriage
;
*NL*
his
formal
civility
was
just
what
it
had
been
,
and
he
detained
her
some
*NL*
minutes
at
the
gate
to
hear
and
satisfy
his
inquiries
after
all
her
*NL*
family
.
They
were
then
,
with
no
other
delay
than
his
pointing
out
the
*NL*
neatness
of
the
entrance
,
taken
into
the
house
;
and
as
soon
as
they
*NL*
were
in
the
parlour
,
he
welcomed
them
a
second
time
,
with
ostentatious
*NL*
formality
to
his
humble
abode
,
and
punctually
repeated
all
his
wife
's
*NL*
offers
of
refreshment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
prepared
to
see
him
in
his
glory
;
and
she
could
not
help
*NL*
in
fancying
that
in
displaying
the
good
proportion
of
the
room
,
its
*NL*
aspect
and
its
furniture
,
he
addressed
himself
particularly
to
her
,
*NL*
as
if
wishing
to
make
her
feel
what
she
had
lost
in
refusing
him
.
But
*NL*
though
everything
seemed
neat
and
comfortable
,
she
was
not
able
to
*NL*
gratify
him
by
any
sigh
of
repentance
,
and
rather
looked
with
wonder
at
*NL*
her
friend
that
she
could
have
so
cheerful
an
air
with
such
a
companion
.
*NL*
When
Mr.
Collins
said
anything
of
which
his
wife
might
reasonably
be
*NL*
ashamed
,
which
certainly
was
not
unseldom
,
she
involuntarily
turned
her
*NL*
eye
on
Charlotte
.
Once
or
twice
she
could
discern
a
faint
blush
;
but
*NL*
in
general
Charlotte
wisely
did
not
hear
.
After
sitting
long
enough
to
*NL*
admire
every
article
of
furniture
in
the
room
,
from
the
sideboard
to
*NL*
the
fender
,
to
give
an
account
of
their
journey
,
and
of
all
that
had
*NL*
happened
in
London
,
Mr.
Collins
invited
them
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
which
was
large
and
well
laid
out
,
and
to
the
cultivation
of
*NL*
which
he
attended
himself
.
To
work
in
this
garden
was
one
of
his
most
*NL*
respectable
pleasures
;
and
Elizabeth
admired
the
command
of
countenance
*NL*
with
which
Charlotte
talked
of
the
healthfulness
of
the
exercise
,
and
*NL*
owned
she
encouraged
it
as
much
as
possible
.
Here
,
leading
the
way
*NL*
through
every
walk
and
cross
walk
,
and
scarcely
allowing
them
an
*NL*
interval
to
utter
the
praises
he
asked
for
,
every
view
was
pointed
out
*NL*
with
a
minuteness
which
left
beauty
entirely
behind
.
He
could
number
the
*NL*
fields
in
every
direction
,
and
could
tell
how
many
trees
there
were
in
*NL*
the
most
distant
clump
.
But
of
all
the
views
which
his
garden
,
or
which
*NL*
the
country
or
kingdom
could
boast
,
none
were
to
be
compared
with
the
*NL*
prospect
of
Rosings
,
afforded
by
an
opening
in
the
trees
that
bordered
*NL*
the
park
nearly
opposite
the
front
of
his
house
.
It
was
a
handsome
*NL*
modern
building
,
well
situated
on
rising
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
his
garden
,
Mr.
Collins
would
have
led
them
round
his
two
meadows
;
*NL*
but
the
ladies
,
not
having
shoes
to
encounter
the
remains
of
a
white
*NL*
frost
,
turned
back
;
and
while
Sir
William
accompanied
him
,
Charlotte
*NL*
took
her
sister
and
friend
over
the
house
,
extremely
well
pleased
,
*NL*
probably
,
to
have
the
opportunity
of
showing
it
without
her
husband
's
*NL*
help
.
It
was
rather
small
,
but
well
built
and
convenient
;
and
everything
*NL*
was
fitted
up
and
arranged
with
a
neatness
and
consistency
of
which
*NL*
Elizabeth
gave
Charlotte
all
the
credit
.
When
Mr.
Collins
could
be
*NL*
forgotten
,
there
was
really
an
air
of
great
comfort
throughout
,
and
by
*NL*
Charlotte
's
evident
enjoyment
of
it
,
Elizabeth
supposed
he
must
be
often
*NL*
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
already
learnt
that
Lady
Catherine
was
still
in
the
country
.
It
*NL*
was
spoken
of
again
while
they
were
at
dinner
,
when
Mr.
Collins
joining
*NL*
in
,
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
Elizabeth
,
you
will
have
the
honour
of
seeing
Lady
Catherine
*NL*
de
Bourgh
on
the
ensuing
Sunday
at
church
,
and
I
need
not
say
you
will
*NL*
be
delighted
with
her
.
She
is
all
affability
and
condescension
,
and
I
*NL*
doubt
not
but
you
will
be
honoured
with
some
portion
of
her
notice
*NL*
when
service
is
over
.
I
have
scarcely
any
hesitation
in
saying
she
*NL*
will
include
you
and
my
sister
Maria
in
every
invitation
with
which
she
*NL*
honours
us
during
your
stay
here
.
Her
behaviour
to
my
dear
Charlotte
is
*NL*
charming
.
We
dine
at
Rosings
twice
every
week
,
and
are
never
allowed
*NL*
to
walk
home
.
Her
ladyship
's
carriage
is
regularly
ordered
for
us
.
I
*NL*
_
should
_
say
,
one
of
her
ladyship
's
carriages
,
for
she
has
several
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
Catherine
is
a
very
respectable
,
sensible
woman
indeed
,
''
added
*NL*
Charlotte
,
``
and
a
most
attentive
neighbour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
my
dear
,
that
is
exactly
what
I
say
.
She
is
the
sort
of
*NL*
woman
whom
one
can
not
regard
with
too
much
deference
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
was
spent
chiefly
in
talking
over
Hertfordshire
news
,
*NL*
and
telling
again
what
had
already
been
written
;
and
when
it
closed
,
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
in
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
,
had
to
meditate
upon
*NL*
Charlotte
's
degree
of
contentment
,
to
understand
her
address
in
guiding
,
*NL*
and
composure
in
bearing
with
,
her
husband
,
and
to
acknowledge
that
it
*NL*
was
all
done
very
well
.
She
had
also
to
anticipate
how
her
visit
*NL*
would
pass
,
the
quiet
tenor
of
their
usual
employments
,
the
vexatious
*NL*
interruptions
of
Mr.
Collins
,
and
the
gaieties
of
their
intercourse
with
*NL*
Rosings
.
A
lively
imagination
soon
settled
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
middle
of
the
next
day
,
as
she
was
in
her
room
getting
ready
*NL*
for
a
walk
,
a
sudden
noise
below
seemed
to
speak
the
whole
house
in
*NL*
confusion
;
and
,
after
listening
a
moment
,
she
heard
somebody
running
*NL*
up
stairs
in
a
violent
hurry
,
and
calling
loudly
after
her
.
She
opened
*NL*
the
door
and
met
Maria
in
the
landing
place
,
who
,
breathless
with
*NL*
agitation
,
cried
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
Eliza
!
pray
make
haste
and
come
into
the
dining-room
,
for
*NL*
there
is
such
a
sight
to
be
seen
!
I
will
not
tell
you
what
it
is
.
Make
*NL*
haste
,
and
come
down
this
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
asked
questions
in
vain
;
Maria
would
tell
her
nothing
more
,
*NL*
and
down
they
ran
into
the
dining-room
,
which
fronted
the
lane
,
in
*NL*
quest
of
this
wonder
;
It
was
two
ladies
stopping
in
a
low
phaeton
at
the
*NL*
garden
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
this
all
?
''
cried
Elizabeth
.
``
I
expected
at
least
that
the
pigs
*NL*
were
got
into
the
garden
,
and
here
is
nothing
but
Lady
Catherine
and
her
*NL*
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
!
my
dear
,
''
said
Maria
,
quite
shocked
at
the
mistake
,
``
it
is
not
*NL*
Lady
Catherine
.
The
old
lady
is
Mrs.
Jenkinson
,
who
lives
with
them
;
*NL*
the
other
is
Miss
de
Bourgh
.
Only
look
at
her
.
She
is
quite
a
little
*NL*
creature
.
Who
would
have
thought
that
she
could
be
so
thin
and
small
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
abominably
rude
to
keep
Charlotte
out
of
doors
in
all
this
wind
.
*NL*
Why
does
she
not
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Charlotte
says
she
hardly
ever
does
.
It
is
the
greatest
of
favours
*NL*
when
Miss
de
Bourgh
comes
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
her
appearance
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
struck
with
other
ideas
.
``
She
*NL*
looks
sickly
and
cross
.
Yes
,
she
will
do
for
him
very
well
.
She
will
*NL*
make
him
a
very
proper
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
and
Charlotte
were
both
standing
at
the
gate
in
conversation
*NL*
with
the
ladies
;
and
Sir
William
,
to
Elizabeth
's
high
diversion
,
was
*NL*
stationed
in
the
doorway
,
in
earnest
contemplation
of
the
greatness
*NL*
before
him
,
and
constantly
bowing
whenever
Miss
de
Bourgh
looked
that
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
;
the
ladies
drove
on
,
and
*NL*
the
others
returned
into
the
house
.
Mr.
Collins
no
sooner
saw
the
two
*NL*
girls
than
he
began
to
congratulate
them
on
their
good
fortune
,
which
*NL*
Charlotte
explained
by
letting
them
know
that
the
whole
party
was
asked
*NL*
to
dine
at
Rosings
the
next
day
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
's
triumph
,
in
consequence
of
this
invitation
,
was
complete
.
*NL*
The
power
of
displaying
the
grandeur
of
his
patroness
to
his
wondering
*NL*
visitors
,
and
of
letting
them
see
her
civility
towards
himself
and
his
*NL*
wife
,
was
exactly
what
he
had
wished
for
;
and
that
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
doing
it
should
be
given
so
soon
,
was
such
an
instance
of
Lady
*NL*
Catherine
's
condescension
,
as
he
knew
not
how
to
admire
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
I
should
not
have
been
at
all
surprised
by
*NL*
her
ladyship
's
asking
us
on
Sunday
to
drink
tea
and
spend
the
evening
at
*NL*
Rosings
.
I
rather
expected
,
from
my
knowledge
of
her
affability
,
that
it
*NL*
would
happen
.
But
who
could
have
foreseen
such
an
attention
as
this
?
Who
*NL*
could
have
imagined
that
we
should
receive
an
invitation
to
dine
there
*NL*
-LRB-
an
invitation
,
moreover
,
including
the
whole
party
-RRB-
so
immediately
*NL*
after
your
arrival
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
less
surprised
at
what
has
happened
,
''
replied
Sir
William
,
*NL*
``
from
that
knowledge
of
what
the
manners
of
the
great
really
are
,
which
*NL*
my
situation
in
life
has
allowed
me
to
acquire
.
About
the
court
,
such
*NL*
instances
of
elegant
breeding
are
not
uncommon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
anything
was
talked
of
the
whole
day
or
next
morning
but
their
*NL*
visit
to
Rosings
.
Mr.
Collins
was
carefully
instructing
them
in
what
*NL*
they
were
to
expect
,
that
the
sight
of
such
rooms
,
so
many
servants
,
and
*NL*
so
splendid
a
dinner
,
might
not
wholly
overpower
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
ladies
were
separating
for
the
toilette
,
he
said
to
Elizabeth
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
,
my
dear
cousin
,
about
your
apparel
.
Lady
*NL*
Catherine
is
far
from
requiring
that
elegance
of
dress
in
us
which
*NL*
becomes
herself
and
her
daughter
.
I
would
advise
you
merely
to
put
on
*NL*
whatever
of
your
clothes
is
superior
to
the
rest
--
there
is
no
occasion
*NL*
for
anything
more
.
Lady
Catherine
will
not
think
the
worse
of
you
*NL*
for
being
simply
dressed
.
She
likes
to
have
the
distinction
of
rank
*NL*
preserved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
dressing
,
he
came
two
or
three
times
to
their
different
*NL*
doors
,
to
recommend
their
being
quick
,
as
Lady
Catherine
very
much
*NL*
objected
to
be
kept
waiting
for
her
dinner
.
Such
formidable
accounts
of
*NL*
her
ladyship
,
and
her
manner
of
living
,
quite
frightened
Maria
Lucas
*NL*
who
had
been
little
used
to
company
,
and
she
looked
forward
to
her
*NL*
introduction
at
Rosings
with
as
much
apprehension
as
her
father
had
done
*NL*
to
his
presentation
at
St.
James
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
weather
was
fine
,
they
had
a
pleasant
walk
of
about
half
a
*NL*
mile
across
the
park
.
Every
park
has
its
beauty
and
its
prospects
;
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
saw
much
to
be
pleased
with
,
though
she
could
not
be
in
such
*NL*
raptures
as
Mr.
Collins
expected
the
scene
to
inspire
,
and
was
but
*NL*
slightly
affected
by
his
enumeration
of
the
windows
in
front
of
the
*NL*
house
,
and
his
relation
of
what
the
glazing
altogether
had
originally
*NL*
cost
Sir
Lewis
de
Bourgh
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
ascended
the
steps
to
the
hall
,
Maria
's
alarm
was
every
*NL*
moment
increasing
,
and
even
Sir
William
did
not
look
perfectly
calm
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
courage
did
not
fail
her
.
She
had
heard
nothing
of
Lady
*NL*
Catherine
that
spoke
her
awful
from
any
extraordinary
talents
or
*NL*
miraculous
virtue
,
and
the
mere
stateliness
of
money
or
rank
she
thought
*NL*
she
could
witness
without
trepidation
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
entrance-hall
,
of
which
Mr.
Collins
pointed
out
,
with
a
*NL*
rapturous
air
,
the
fine
proportion
and
the
finished
ornaments
,
they
*NL*
followed
the
servants
through
an
ante-chamber
,
to
the
room
where
Lady
*NL*
Catherine
,
her
daughter
,
and
Mrs.
Jenkinson
were
sitting
.
Her
ladyship
,
*NL*
with
great
condescension
,
arose
to
receive
them
;
and
as
Mrs.
Collins
had
*NL*
settled
it
with
her
husband
that
the
office
of
introduction
should
*NL*
be
hers
,
it
was
performed
in
a
proper
manner
,
without
any
of
those
*NL*
apologies
and
thanks
which
he
would
have
thought
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
having
been
at
St.
James
's
,
Sir
William
was
so
completely
*NL*
awed
by
the
grandeur
surrounding
him
,
that
he
had
but
just
courage
*NL*
enough
to
make
a
very
low
bow
,
and
take
his
seat
without
saying
a
word
;
*NL*
and
his
daughter
,
frightened
almost
out
of
her
senses
,
sat
on
the
edge
*NL*
of
her
chair
,
not
knowing
which
way
to
look
.
Elizabeth
found
herself
*NL*
quite
equal
to
the
scene
,
and
could
observe
the
three
ladies
before
her
*NL*
composedly
.
Lady
Catherine
was
a
tall
,
large
woman
,
with
strongly-marked
*NL*
features
,
which
might
once
have
been
handsome
.
Her
air
was
not
*NL*
conciliating
,
nor
was
her
manner
of
receiving
them
such
as
to
make
her
*NL*
visitors
forget
their
inferior
rank
.
She
was
not
rendered
formidable
by
*NL*
silence
;
but
whatever
she
said
was
spoken
in
so
authoritative
a
tone
,
*NL*
as
marked
her
self-importance
,
and
brought
Mr.
Wickham
immediately
to
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
mind
;
and
from
the
observation
of
the
day
altogether
,
she
*NL*
believed
Lady
Catherine
to
be
exactly
what
he
represented
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
after
examining
the
mother
,
in
whose
countenance
and
deportment
*NL*
she
soon
found
some
resemblance
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
she
turned
her
eyes
on
the
*NL*
daughter
,
she
could
almost
have
joined
in
Maria
's
astonishment
at
her
*NL*
being
so
thin
and
so
small
.
There
was
neither
in
figure
nor
face
any
*NL*
likeness
between
the
ladies
.
Miss
de
Bourgh
was
pale
and
sickly
;
her
*NL*
features
,
though
not
plain
,
were
insignificant
;
and
she
spoke
very
*NL*
little
,
except
in
a
low
voice
,
to
Mrs.
Jenkinson
,
in
whose
appearance
*NL*
there
was
nothing
remarkable
,
and
who
was
entirely
engaged
in
listening
*NL*
to
what
she
said
,
and
placing
a
screen
in
the
proper
direction
before
*NL*
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
sitting
a
few
minutes
,
they
were
all
sent
to
one
of
the
windows
to
*NL*
admire
the
view
,
Mr.
Collins
attending
them
to
point
out
its
beauties
,
*NL*
and
Lady
Catherine
kindly
informing
them
that
it
was
much
better
worth
*NL*
looking
at
in
the
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
exceedingly
handsome
,
and
there
were
all
the
servants
and
*NL*
all
the
articles
of
plate
which
Mr.
Collins
had
promised
;
and
,
as
he
had
*NL*
likewise
foretold
,
he
took
his
seat
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
by
her
*NL*
ladyship
's
desire
,
and
looked
as
if
he
felt
that
life
could
furnish
*NL*
nothing
greater
.
He
carved
,
and
ate
,
and
praised
with
delighted
*NL*
alacrity
;
and
every
dish
was
commended
,
first
by
him
and
then
by
Sir
*NL*
William
,
who
was
now
enough
recovered
to
echo
whatever
his
son-in-law
*NL*
said
,
in
a
manner
which
Elizabeth
wondered
Lady
Catherine
could
bear
.
*NL*
But
Lady
Catherine
seemed
gratified
by
their
excessive
admiration
,
and
*NL*
gave
most
gracious
smiles
,
especially
when
any
dish
on
the
table
proved
*NL*
a
novelty
to
them
.
The
party
did
not
supply
much
conversation
.
Elizabeth
*NL*
was
ready
to
speak
whenever
there
was
an
opening
,
but
she
was
seated
*NL*
between
Charlotte
and
Miss
de
Bourgh
--
the
former
of
whom
was
engaged
in
*NL*
listening
to
Lady
Catherine
,
and
the
latter
said
not
a
word
to
her
all
*NL*
dinner-time
.
Mrs.
Jenkinson
was
chiefly
employed
in
watching
how
little
*NL*
Miss
de
Bourgh
ate
,
pressing
her
to
try
some
other
dish
,
and
fearing
*NL*
she
was
indisposed
.
Maria
thought
speaking
out
of
the
question
,
and
the
*NL*
gentlemen
did
nothing
but
eat
and
admire
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
ladies
returned
to
the
drawing-room
,
there
was
little
to
*NL*
be
done
but
to
hear
Lady
Catherine
talk
,
which
she
did
without
any
*NL*
intermission
till
coffee
came
in
,
delivering
her
opinion
on
every
*NL*
subject
in
so
decisive
a
manner
,
as
proved
that
she
was
not
used
to
*NL*
have
her
judgement
controverted
.
She
inquired
into
Charlotte
's
domestic
*NL*
concerns
familiarly
and
minutely
,
gave
her
a
great
deal
of
advice
as
*NL*
to
the
management
of
them
all
;
told
her
how
everything
ought
to
be
*NL*
regulated
in
so
small
a
family
as
hers
,
and
instructed
her
as
to
the
*NL*
care
of
her
cows
and
her
poultry
.
Elizabeth
found
that
nothing
was
*NL*
beneath
this
great
lady
's
attention
,
which
could
furnish
her
with
an
*NL*
occasion
of
dictating
to
others
.
In
the
intervals
of
her
discourse
*NL*
with
Mrs.
Collins
,
she
addressed
a
variety
of
questions
to
Maria
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
but
especially
to
the
latter
,
of
whose
connections
she
knew
*NL*
the
least
,
and
who
she
observed
to
Mrs.
Collins
was
a
very
genteel
,
*NL*
pretty
kind
of
girl
.
She
asked
her
,
at
different
times
,
how
many
sisters
*NL*
she
had
,
whether
they
were
older
or
younger
than
herself
,
whether
any
of
*NL*
them
were
likely
to
be
married
,
whether
they
were
handsome
,
where
they
*NL*
had
been
educated
,
what
carriage
her
father
kept
,
and
what
had
been
*NL*
her
mother
's
maiden
name
?
Elizabeth
felt
all
the
impertinence
of
*NL*
her
questions
but
answered
them
very
composedly
.
Lady
Catherine
then
*NL*
observed
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
's
estate
is
entailed
on
Mr.
Collins
,
I
think
.
For
your
*NL*
sake
,
''
turning
to
Charlotte
,
``
I
am
glad
of
it
;
but
otherwise
I
see
no
*NL*
occasion
for
entailing
estates
from
the
female
line
.
It
was
not
thought
*NL*
necessary
in
Sir
Lewis
de
Bourgh
's
family
.
Do
you
play
and
sing

*NL*
Bennet

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

some
time

other

shall
be
happy

*NL*
``
My

quite
a
slave
to
your
education
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
hardly
help
smiling
as
she
assured
her
that
had
not
been
*NL*
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
who
taught
you
?
who
attended
to
you
?
Without
a
governess
,
you
*NL*
must
have
been
neglected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Compared
with
some
families
,
I
believe
we
were
;
but
such
of
us
as
*NL*
wished
to
learn
never
wanted
the
means
.
We
were
always
encouraged
to
*NL*
read
,
and
had
all
the
masters
that
were
necessary
.
Those
who
chose
to
be
*NL*
idle
,
certainly
might
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
no
doubt
;
but
that
is
what
a
governess
will
prevent
,
and
if
I
had
*NL*
known
your
mother
,
I
should
have
advised
her
most
strenuously
to
engage
*NL*
one
.
I
always
say
that
nothing
is
to
be
done
in
education
without
steady
*NL*
and
regular
instruction
,
and
nobody
but
a
governess
can
give
it
.
It
is
*NL*
wonderful
how
many
families
I
have
been
the
means
of
supplying
in
that
*NL*
way
.
I
am
always
glad
to
get
a
young
person
well
placed
out
.
Four
nieces
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Jenkinson
are
most
delightfully
situated
through
my
means
;
and
*NL*
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
I
recommended
another
young
person
,
*NL*
who
was
merely
accidentally
mentioned
to
me
,
and
the
family
are
quite
*NL*
delighted
with
her
.
Mrs.
Collins
,
did
I
tell
you
of
Lady
Metcalf
's
*NL*
calling
yesterday
to
thank
me
?
She
finds
Miss
Pope
a
treasure
.
`
Lady
*NL*
Catherine
,
'
said
she
,
`
you
have
given
me
a
treasure
.
'
Are
any
of
your
*NL*
younger
sisters
out
,
Miss
Bennet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
!
What
,
all
five
out
at
once
?
Very
odd
!
And
you
only
the
second
.
The
*NL*
younger
ones
out
before
the
elder
ones
are
married
!
Your
younger
sisters
*NL*
must
be
very
young
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
youngest
is
not
sixteen
.
Perhaps
_
she
_
is
full
young
to
be
*NL*
much
in
company
.
But
really
,
ma'am
,
I
think
it
would
be
very
hard
upon
*NL*
younger
sisters
,
that
they
should
not
have
their
share
of
society
and
*NL*
amusement
,
because
the
elder
may
not
have
the
means
or
inclination
to
*NL*
marry
early
.
The
last-born
has
as
good
a
right
to
the
pleasures
of
youth
*NL*
as
the
first
.
And
to
be
kept
back
on
_
such
_
a
motive
!
I
think
it
would
*NL*
not
be
very
likely
to
promote
sisterly
affection
or
delicacy
of
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
said
her
ladyship
,
``
you
give
your
opinion
very
decidedly
*NL*
for
so
young
a
person
.
Pray
,
what
is
your
age
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
three
younger
sisters
grown
up
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
,
smiling
,
``
your
*NL*
ladyship
can
hardly
expect
me
to
own
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Catherine
seemed
quite
astonished
at
not
receiving
a
direct
answer
;
*NL*
and
Elizabeth
suspected
herself
to
be
the
first
creature
who
had
ever
*NL*
dared
to
trifle
with
so
much
dignified
impertinence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
be
more
than
twenty
,
I
am
sure
,
therefore
you
need
not
*NL*
conceal
your
age
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
one-and-twenty

*NL*
*NL*
When
the
gentlemen
had
joined
them
,
and
tea
was
over
,
the
card-tables
*NL*
were
placed
.
Lady
Catherine
,
Sir
William
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Collins
sat
*NL*
down
to
quadrille
;
and
as
Miss
de
Bourgh
chose
to
play
at
cassino
,
the
*NL*
two
girls
had
the
honour
of
assisting
Mrs.
Jenkinson
to
make
up
her
*NL*
party
.
Their
table
was
superlatively
stupid
.
Scarcely
a
syllable
was
*NL*
uttered
that
did
not
relate
to
the
game
,
except
when
Mrs.
Jenkinson
*NL*
expressed
her
fears
of
Miss
de
Bourgh
's
being
too
hot
or
too
cold
,
or
*NL*
having
too
much
or
too
little
light
.
A
great
deal
more
passed
at
the
*NL*
other
table
.
Lady
Catherine
was
generally
speaking
--
stating
the
mistakes
*NL*
of
the
three
others
,
or
relating
some
anecdote
of
herself
.
Mr.
Collins
*NL*
was
employed
in
agreeing
to
everything
her
ladyship
said
,
thanking
her
*NL*
for
every
fish
he
won
,
and
apologising
if
he
thought
he
won
too
many
.
*NL*
Sir
William
did
not
say
much
.
He
was
storing
his
memory
with
anecdotes
*NL*
and
noble
names
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter
had
played
as
long
as
they
chose
,
*NL*
the
tables
were
broken
up
,
the
carriage
was
offered
to
Mrs.
Collins
,
*NL*
gratefully
accepted
and
immediately
ordered
.
The
party
then
gathered
*NL*
round
the
fire
to
hear
Lady
Catherine
determine
what
weather
they
were
*NL*
to
have
on
the
morrow
.
From
these
instructions
they
were
summoned
by
*NL*
the
arrival
of
the
coach
;
and
with
many
speeches
of
thankfulness
on
Mr.
*NL*
Collins
's
side
and
as
many
bows
on
Sir
William
's
they
departed
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
they
had
driven
from
the
door
,
Elizabeth
was
called
on
by
her
cousin
*NL*
to
give
her
opinion
of
all
that
she
had
seen
at
Rosings
,
which
,
for
*NL*
Charlotte
's
sake
,
she
made
more
favourable
than
it
really
was
.
But
her
*NL*
commendation
,
though
costing
her
some
trouble
,
could
by
no
means
satisfy
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
,
and
he
was
very
soon
obliged
to
take
her
ladyship
's
praise
*NL*
into
his
own
hands
.

Chapter
30
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
William
stayed
only
a
week
at
Hunsford
,
but
his
visit
was
long
*NL*
enough
to
convince
him
of
his
daughter
's
being
most
comfortably
settled
,
*NL*
and
of
her
possessing
such
a
husband
and
such
a
neighbour
as
were
not
*NL*
often
met
with
.
While
Sir
William
was
with
them
,
Mr.
Collins
devoted
his
*NL*
morning
to
driving
him
out
in
his
gig
,
and
showing
him
the
country
;
but
*NL*
when
he
went
away
,
the
whole
family
returned
to
their
usual
employments
,
*NL*
and
Elizabeth
was
thankful
to
find
that
they
did
not
see
more
of
her
*NL*
cousin
by
the
alteration
,
for
the
chief
of
the
time
between
breakfast
*NL*
and
dinner
was
now
passed
by
him
either
at
work
in
the
garden
or
in
*NL*
reading
and
writing
,
and
looking
out
of
the
window
in
his
own
book-room
,
*NL*
which
fronted
the
road
.
The
room
in
which
the
ladies
sat
was
backwards
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
at
first
rather
wondered
that
Charlotte
should
not
prefer
*NL*
the
dining-parlour
for
common
use
;
it
was
a
better
sized
room
,
and
had
a
*NL*
more
pleasant
aspect
;
but
she
soon
saw
that
her
friend
had
an
excellent
*NL*
reason
for
what
she
did
,
for
Mr.
Collins
would
undoubtedly
have
been
*NL*
much
less
in
his
own
apartment
,
had
they
sat
in
one
equally
lively
;
and
*NL*
she
gave
Charlotte
credit
for
the
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
drawing-room
they
could
distinguish
nothing
in
the
lane
,
and
*NL*
were
indebted
to
Mr.
Collins
for
the
knowledge
of
what
carriages
went
*NL*
along
,
and
how
often
especially
Miss
de
Bourgh
drove
by
in
her
phaeton
,
*NL*
which
he
never
failed
coming
to
inform
them
of
,
though
it
happened
*NL*
almost
every
day
.
She
not
unfrequently
stopped
at
the
Parsonage
,
and
*NL*
had
a
few
minutes
'
conversation
with
Charlotte
,
but
was
scarcely
ever
*NL*
prevailed
upon
to
get
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
few
days
passed
in
which
Mr.
Collins
did
not
walk
to
Rosings
,
and
*NL*
not
many
in
which
his
wife
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
go
likewise
;
*NL*
and
till
Elizabeth
recollected
that
there
might
be
other
family
livings
*NL*
to
be
disposed
of
,
she
could
not
understand
the
sacrifice
of
so
many
*NL*
hours
.
Now
and
then
they
were
honoured
with
a
call
from
her
ladyship
,
*NL*
and
nothing
escaped
her
observation
that
was
passing
in
the
room
during
*NL*
these
visits
.
She
examined
into
their
employments
,
looked
at
their
work
,
*NL*
and
advised
them
to
do
it
differently
;
found
fault
with
the
arrangement
*NL*
of
the
furniture
;
or
detected
the
housemaid
in
negligence
;
and
if
she
*NL*
accepted
any
refreshment
,
seemed
to
do
it
only
for
the
sake
of
finding
*NL*
out
that
Mrs.
Collins
's
joints
of
meat
were
too
large
for
her
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
soon
perceived
,
that
though
this
great
lady
was
not
in
*NL*
commission
of
the
peace
of
the
county
,
she
was
a
most
active
magistrate
*NL*
in
her
own
parish
,
the
minutest
concerns
of
which
were
carried
to
her
*NL*
by
Mr.
Collins
;
and
whenever
any
of
the
cottagers
were
disposed
to
*NL*
be
quarrelsome
,
discontented
,
or
too
poor
,
she
sallied
forth
into
the
*NL*
village
to
settle
their
differences
,
silence
their
complaints
,
and
scold
*NL*
them
into
harmony
and
plenty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entertainment
of
dining
at
Rosings
was
repeated
about
twice
a
week
;
*NL*
and
,
allowing
for
the
loss
of
Sir
William
,
and
there
being
only
one
*NL*
card-table
in
the
evening
,
every
such
entertainment
was
the
counterpart
*NL*
of
the
first
.
Their
other
engagements
were
few
,
as
the
style
of
living
*NL*
in
the
neighbourhood
in
general
was
beyond
Mr.
Collins
's
reach
.
This
,
*NL*
however
,
was
no
evil
to
Elizabeth
,
and
upon
the
whole
she
spent
her
time
*NL*
comfortably
enough
;
there
were
half-hours
of
pleasant
conversation
with
*NL*
Charlotte
,
and
the
weather
was
so
fine
for
the
time
of
year
that
she
had
*NL*
often
great
enjoyment
out
of
doors
.
Her
favourite
walk
,
and
where
she
*NL*
frequently
went
while
the
others
were
calling
on
Lady
Catherine
,
was
*NL*
along
the
open
grove
which
edged
that
side
of
the
park
,
where
there
was
*NL*
a
nice
sheltered
path
,
which
no
one
seemed
to
value
but
herself
,
and
*NL*
where
she
felt
beyond
the
reach
of
Lady
Catherine
's
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
quiet
way
,
the
first
fortnight
of
her
visit
soon
passed
away
.
*NL*
Easter
was
approaching
,
and
the
week
preceding
it
was
to
bring
an
*NL*
addition
to
the
family
at
Rosings
,
which
in
so
small
a
circle
must
be
*NL*
important
.
Elizabeth
had
heard
soon
after
her
arrival
that
Mr.
Darcy
was
*NL*
expected
there
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
,
and
though
there
were
not
*NL*
many
of
her
acquaintances
whom
she
did
not
prefer
,
his
coming
would
*NL*
furnish
one
comparatively
new
to
look
at
in
their
Rosings
parties
,
and
*NL*
she
might
be
amused
in
seeing
how
hopeless
Miss
Bingley
's
designs
on
him
*NL*
were
,
by
his
behaviour
to
his
cousin
,
for
whom
he
was
evidently
*NL*
destined
by
Lady
Catherine
,
who
talked
of
his
coming
with
the
greatest
*NL*
satisfaction
,
spoke
of
him
in
terms
of
the
highest
admiration
,
and
*NL*
seemed
almost
angry
to
find
that
he
had
already
been
frequently
seen
by
*NL*
Miss
Lucas
and
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
arrival
was
soon
known
at
the
Parsonage
;
for
Mr.
Collins
was
walking
*NL*
the
whole
morning
within
view
of
the
lodges
opening
into
Hunsford
Lane
,
*NL*
in
order
to
have
the
earliest
assurance
of
it
,
and
after
making
his
*NL*
bow
as
the
carriage
turned
into
the
Park
,
hurried
home
with
the
great
*NL*
intelligence
.
On
the
following
morning
he
hastened
to
Rosings
to
pay
his
*NL*
respects
.
There
were
two
nephews
of
Lady
Catherine
to
require
them
,
for
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
had
brought
with
him
a
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
the
younger
son
of
*NL*
his
uncle
Lord
--
,
and
,
to
the
great
surprise
of
all
the
party
,
when
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
returned
,
the
gentlemen
accompanied
him
.
Charlotte
had
seen
*NL*
them
from
her
husband
's
room
,
crossing
the
road
,
and
immediately
running
*NL*
into
the
other
,
told
the
girls
what
an
honour
they
might
expect
,
adding
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
thank
you
,
Eliza
,
for
this
piece
of
civility
.
Mr.
Darcy
would
*NL*
never
have
come
so
soon
to
wait
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
scarcely
time
to
disclaim
all
right
to
the
compliment
,
*NL*
before
their
approach
was
announced
by
the
door-bell
,
and
shortly
*NL*
afterwards
the
three
gentlemen
entered
the
room
.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
*NL*
who
led
the
way
,
was
about
thirty
,
not
handsome
,
but
in
person
and
*NL*
address
most
truly
the
gentleman
.
Mr.
Darcy
looked
just
as
he
had
been
*NL*
used
to
look
in
Hertfordshire
--
paid
his
compliments
,
with
his
usual
*NL*
reserve
,
to
Mrs.
Collins
,
and
whatever
might
be
his
feelings
toward
her
*NL*
friend
,
met
her
with
every
appearance
of
composure
.
Elizabeth
merely
*NL*
curtseyed
to
him
without
saying
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
entered
into
conversation
directly
with
the
*NL*
readiness
and
ease
of
a
well-bred
man
,
and
talked
very
pleasantly
;
but
*NL*
his
cousin
,
after
having
addressed
a
slight
observation
on
the
house
and
*NL*
garden
to
Mrs.
Collins
,
sat
for
some
time
without
speaking
to
anybody
.
*NL*
At
length
,
however
,
his
civility
was
so
far
awakened
as
to
inquire
of
*NL*
Elizabeth
after
the
health
of
her
family
.
She
answered
him
in
the
usual
*NL*
way
,
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
eldest
sister
has
been
in
town
these
three
months
.
Have
you
never
*NL*
happened
to
see
her
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
perfectly
sensible
that
he
never
had
;
but
she
wished
to
see
*NL*
whether
he
would
betray
any
consciousness
of
what
had
passed
between
*NL*
the
Bingleys
and
Jane
,
and
she
thought
he
looked
a
little
confused
as
he
*NL*
answered
that
he
had
never
been
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
Miss
Bennet
.
The
*NL*
subject
was
pursued
no
farther
,
and
the
gentlemen
soon
afterwards
went
*NL*
away
.

*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
's
manners
were
very
much
admired
at
the
Parsonage
,
*NL*
and
the
ladies
all
felt
that
he
must
add
considerably
to
the
pleasures
*NL*
of
their
engagements
at
Rosings
.
It
was
some
days
,
however
,
before
they
*NL*
received
any
invitation
thither
--
for
while
there
were
visitors
in
the
*NL*
house
,
they
could
not
be
necessary
;
and
it
was
not
till
Easter-day
,
*NL*
almost
a
week
after
the
gentlemen
's
arrival
,
that
they
were
honoured
by
*NL*
such
an
attention
,
and
then
they
were
merely
asked
on
leaving
church
to
*NL*
come
there
in
the
evening
.
For
the
last
week
they
had
seen
very
little
*NL*
of
Lady
Catherine
or
her
daughter
.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
had
called
at
the
*NL*
Parsonage
more
than
once
during
the
time
,
but
Mr.
Darcy
they
had
seen
*NL*
only
at
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
invitation
was
accepted
of
course
,
and
at
a
proper
hour
they
joined
*NL*
the
party
in
Lady
Catherine
's
drawing-room
.
Her
ladyship
received
*NL*
them
civilly
,
but
it
was
plain
that
their
company
was
by
no
means
so
*NL*
acceptable
as
when
she
could
get
nobody
else
;
and
she
was
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
almost
engrossed
by
her
nephews
,
speaking
to
them
,
especially
to
Darcy
,
*NL*
much
more
than
to
any
other
person
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
seemed
really
glad
to
see
them
;
anything
was
a
*NL*
welcome
relief
to
him
at
Rosings
;
and
Mrs.
Collins
's
pretty
friend
had
*NL*
moreover
caught
his
fancy
very
much
.
He
now
seated
himself
by
her
,
and
*NL*
talked
so
agreeably
of
Kent
and
Hertfordshire
,
of
travelling
and
staying
*NL*
at
home
,
of
new
books
and
music
,
that
Elizabeth
had
never
been
half
so
*NL*
well
entertained
in
that
room
before
;
and
they
conversed
with
so
much
*NL*
spirit
and
flow
,
as
to
draw
the
attention
of
Lady
Catherine
herself
,
*NL*
as
well
as
of
Mr.
Darcy
.
_
His
_
eyes
had
been
soon
and
repeatedly
turned
*NL*
towards
them
with
a
look
of
curiosity
;
and
that
her
ladyship
,
after
a
*NL*
while
,
shared
the
feeling
,
was
more
openly
acknowledged
,
for
she
did
not
*NL*
scruple
to
call
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
you
are
saying
,
Fitzwilliam
?
What
is
it
you
are
talking
*NL*
of
?
What
are
you
telling
Miss
Bennet
?
Let
me
hear
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
speaking
of
music
,
madam
,
''
said
he
,
when
no
longer
able
to
avoid
*NL*
a
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
music
!
Then
pray
speak
aloud
.
It
is
of
all
subjects
my
delight
.
I
*NL*
must
have
my
share
in
the
conversation
if
you
are
speaking
of
music
.
*NL*
There
are
few
people
in
England
,
I
suppose
,
who
have
more
true
enjoyment
*NL*
of
music
than
myself
,
or
a
better
natural
taste
.
If
I
had
ever
learnt
,
*NL*
I
should
have
been
a
great
proficient
.
And
so
would
Anne
,
if
her
health
*NL*
had
allowed
her
to
apply
.
I
am
confident
that
she
would
have
performed
*NL*
delightfully
.
How
does
Georgiana
get
on
,
Darcy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
spoke
with
affectionate
praise
of
his
sister
's
proficiency
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
such
a
good
account
of
her
,
''
said
Lady
*NL*
Catherine
;
``
and
pray
tell
her
from
me
,
that
she
can
not
expect
to
excel
*NL*
if
she
does
not
practice
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
madam
,
''
he
replied
,
``
that
she
does
not
need
such
advice
.
*NL*
She
practises
very
constantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
.
It
can
not
be
done
too
much
;
and
when
I
next
write
*NL*
to
her
,
I
shall
charge
her
not
to
neglect
it
on
any
account
.
I
often
*NL*
tell
young
ladies
that
no
excellence
in
music
is
to
be
acquired
without
*NL*
constant
practice
.
I
have
told
Miss
Bennet
several
times
,
that
she
*NL*
will
never
play
really
well
unless
she
practises
more
;
and
though
Mrs.
*NL*
Collins
has
no
instrument
,
she
is
very
welcome
,
as
I
have
often
told
*NL*
her
,
to
come
to
Rosings
every
day
,
and
play
on
the
pianoforte
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Jenkinson
's
room
.
She
would
be
in
nobody
's
way
,
you
know
,
in
that
part
*NL*
of
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
looked
a
little
ashamed
of
his
aunt
's
ill-breeding
,
and
made
*NL*
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
coffee
was
over
,
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
reminded
Elizabeth
of
having
*NL*
promised
to
play
to
him
;
and
she
sat
down
directly
to
the
instrument
.
He
*NL*
drew
a
chair
near
her
.
Lady
Catherine
listened
to
half
a
song
,
and
then
*NL*
talked
,
as
before
,
to
her
other
nephew
;
till
the
latter
walked
away
*NL*
from
her
,
and
making
with
his
usual
deliberation
towards
the
pianoforte
*NL*
stationed
himself
so
as
to
command
a
full
view
of
the
fair
performer
's
*NL*
countenance
.
Elizabeth
saw
what
he
was
doing
,
and
at
the
first
*NL*
convenient
pause
,
turned
to
him
with
an
arch
smile
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
to
frighten
me
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
by
coming
in
all
this
state
to
hear
*NL*
me
?
I
will
not
be
alarmed
though
your
sister
_
does
_
play
so
well
.
There
*NL*
is
a
stubbornness
about
me
that
never
can
bear
to
be
frightened
at
the
*NL*
will
of
others
.
My
courage
always
rises
at
every
attempt
to
intimidate
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
say
you
are
mistaken
,
''
he
replied
,
``
because
you
could
not
*NL*
really
believe
me
to
entertain
any
design
of
alarming
you
;
and
I
have
*NL*
had
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
long
enough
to
know
that
you
find
*NL*
great
enjoyment
in
occasionally
professing
opinions
which
in
fact
are
*NL*
not
your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
laughed
heartily
at
this
picture
of
herself
,
and
said
to
*NL*
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
``
Your
cousin
will
give
you
a
very
pretty
notion
of
*NL*
me
,
and
teach
you
not
to
believe
a
word
I
say
.
I
am
particularly
unlucky
*NL*
in
meeting
with
a
person
so
able
to
expose
my
real
character
,
in
a
part
*NL*
of
the
world
where
I
had
hoped
to
pass
myself
off
with
some
degree
of
*NL*
credit
.
Indeed
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
it
is
very
ungenerous
in
you
to
mention
all
*NL*
that
you
knew
to
my
disadvantage
in
Hertfordshire
--
and
,
give
me
leave
to
*NL*
say
,
very
impolitic
too
--
for
it
is
provoking
me
to
retaliate
,
and
such
*NL*
things
may
come
out
as
will
shock
your
relations
to
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
afraid
of
you
,
''
said
he
,
smilingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
accuse
him
of
,
''
cried
Colonel
*NL*
Fitzwilliam
.
``
I
should
like
to
know
how
he
behaves
among
strangers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
hear
then
--
but
prepare
yourself
for
something
very
dreadful
.
*NL*
The
first
time
of
my
ever
seeing
him
in
Hertfordshire
,
you
must
know
,
*NL*
was
at
a
ball
--
and
at
this
ball
,
what
do
you
think
he
did
?
He
danced
*NL*
only
four
dances
,
though
gentlemen
were
scarce
;
and
,
to
my
certain
*NL*
knowledge
,
more
than
one
young
lady
was
sitting
down
in
want
of
a
*NL*
partner
.
Mr.
Darcy
,
you
can
not
deny
the
fact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
at
that
time
the
honour
of
knowing
any
lady
in
the
assembly
*NL*
beyond
my
own
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
;
and
nobody
can
ever
be
introduced
in
a
ball-room
.
Well
,
Colonel
*NL*
Fitzwilliam
,
what
do
I
play
next
?
My
fingers
wait
your
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Darcy
,
``
I
should
have
judged
better
,
had
I
sought
an
*NL*
introduction
;
but
I
am
ill-qualified
to
recommend
myself
to
strangers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
ask
your
cousin
the
reason
of
this
?
''
said
Elizabeth
,
still
*NL*
addressing
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
.
``
Shall
we
ask
him
why
a
man
of
sense
and
*NL*
education
,
and
who
has
lived
in
the
world
,
is
ill
qualified
to
recommend
*NL*
himself
to
strangers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
answer
your
question
,
''
said
Fitzwilliam
,
``
without
applying
to
*NL*
him
.
It
is
because
he
will
not
give
himself
the
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
have
not
the
talent
which
some
people
possess
,
''
said
Darcy
,
*NL*
``
of
conversing
easily
with
those
I
have
never
seen
before
.
I
can
not
*NL*
catch
their
tone
of
conversation
,
or
appear
interested
in
their
*NL*
concerns
,
as
I
often
see
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
fingers
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
do
not
move
over
this
instrument
in
the
*NL*
masterly
manner
which
I
see
so
many
women
's
do
.
They
have
not
the
same
*NL*
force
or
rapidity
,
and
do
not
produce
the
same
expression
.
But
then
I
*NL*
have
always
supposed
it
to
be
my
own
fault
--
because
I
will
not
take
the
*NL*
trouble
of
practising
.
It
is
not
that
I
do
not
believe
_
my
_
fingers
as
*NL*
capable
as
any
other
woman
's
of
superior
execution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darcy
smiled
and
said
,
``
You
are
perfectly
right
.
You
have
employed
your
*NL*
time
much
better
.
No
one
admitted
to
the
privilege
of
hearing
you
can
*NL*
think
anything
wanting
.
We
neither
of
us
perform
to
strangers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
they
were
interrupted
by
Lady
Catherine
,
who
called
out
to
know
*NL*
what
they
were
talking
of
.
Elizabeth
immediately
began
playing
again
.
*NL*
Lady
Catherine
approached
,
and
,
after
listening
for
a
few
minutes
,
said
*NL*
to
Darcy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Bennet
would
not
play
at
all
amiss
if
she
practised
more
,
and
*NL*
could
have
the
advantage
of
a
London
master
.
She
has
a
very
good
notion
*NL*
of
fingering
,
though
her
taste
is
not
equal
to
Anne
's
.
Anne
would
have
*NL*
been
a
delightful
performer
,
had
her
health
allowed
her
to
learn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
looked
at
Darcy
to
see
how
cordially
he
assented
to
his
*NL*
cousin
's
praise
;
but
neither
at
that
moment
nor
at
any
other
could
she
*NL*
discern
any
symptom
of
love
;
and
from
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
to
Miss
*NL*
de
Bourgh
she
derived
this
comfort
for
Miss
Bingley
,
that
he
might
have
*NL*
been
just
as
likely
to
marry
_
her
_
,
had
she
been
his
relation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Catherine
continued
her
remarks
on
Elizabeth
's
performance
,
mixing
*NL*
with
them
many
instructions
on
execution
and
taste
.
Elizabeth
received
*NL*
them
with
all
the
forbearance
of
civility
,
and
,
at
the
request
of
the
*NL*
gentlemen
,
remained
at
the
instrument
till
her
ladyship
's
carriage
was
*NL*
ready
to
take
them
all
home

Chapter
32
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
sitting
by
herself
the
next
morning
,
and
writing
to
Jane
*NL*
while
Mrs.
Collins
and
Maria
were
gone
on
business
into
the
village
,
*NL*
when
she
was
startled
by
a
ring
at
the
door
,
the
certain
signal
of
a
*NL*
visitor
.
As
she
had
heard
no
carriage
,
she
thought
it
not
unlikely
to
*NL*
be
Lady
Catherine
,
and
under
that
apprehension
was
putting
away
her
*NL*
half-finished
letter
that
she
might
escape
all
impertinent
questions
,
*NL*
when
the
door
opened
,
and
,
to
her
very
great
surprise
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
only
,
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
astonished
too
on
finding
her
alone
,
and
apologised
for
his
*NL*
intrusion
by
letting
her
know
that
he
had
understood
all
the
ladies
were
*NL*
to
be
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
then
sat
down
,
and
when
her
inquiries
after
Rosings
were
made
,
*NL*
seemed
in
danger
of
sinking
into
total
silence
.
It
was
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
,
therefore
,
to
think
of
something
,
and
in
this
emergence
*NL*
recollecting
_
when
_
she
had
seen
him
last
in
Hertfordshire
,
and
*NL*
feeling
curious
to
know
what
he
would
say
on
the
subject
of
their
hasty
*NL*
departure
,
she
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
suddenly
you
all
quitted
Netherfield
last
November
,
Mr.
Darcy
!
*NL*
It
must
have
been
a
most
agreeable
surprise
to
Mr.
Bingley
to
see
you
*NL*
all
after
him
so
soon
;
for
,
if
I
recollect
right
,
he
went
but
the
day
*NL*
before
.
He
and
his
sisters
were
well
,
I
hope
,
when
you
left
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
so
,
I
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
that
she
was
to
receive
no
other
answer
,
and
,
after
a
short
*NL*
pause
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
have
understood
that
Mr.
Bingley
has
not
much
idea
of
ever
*NL*
returning
to
Netherfield
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
heard
him
say
so
;
but
it
is
probable
that
he
may
spend
*NL*
very
little
of
his
time
there
in
the
future
.
He
has
many
friends
,
and
*NL*
is
at
a
time
of
life
when
friends
and
engagements
are
continually
*NL*
increasing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
means
to
be
but
little
at
Netherfield
,
it
would
be
better
for
*NL*
the
neighbourhood
that
he
should
give
up
the
place
entirely
,
for
then
we
*NL*
might
possibly
get
a
settled
family
there
.
But
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
Bingley
did
*NL*
not
take
the
house
so
much
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood
as
*NL*
for
his
own
,
and
we
must
expect
him
to
keep
it
or
quit
it
on
the
same
*NL*
principle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
be
surprised
,
''
said
Darcy
,
``
if
he
were
to
give
it
up
as
*NL*
soon
as
any
eligible
purchase
offers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
made
no
answer
.
She
was
afraid
of
talking
longer
of
his
*NL*
friend
;
and
,
having
nothing
else
to
say
,
was
now
determined
to
leave
the
*NL*
trouble
of
finding
a
subject
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
hint
,
and
soon
began
with
,
``
This
seems
a
very
comfortable
*NL*
house
.
Lady
Catherine
,
I
believe
,
did
a
great
deal
to
it
when
Mr.
*NL*
Collins
first
came
to
Hunsford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
she
did
--
and
I
am
sure
she
could
not
have
bestowed
her
*NL*
kindness
on
a
more
grateful
object
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Collins
appears
to
be
very
fortunate
in
his
choice
of
a
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
his
friends
may
well
rejoice
in
his
having
met
with
one
*NL*
of
the
very
few
sensible
women
who
would
have
accepted
him
,
or
have
made
*NL*
him
happy
if
they
had
.
My
friend
has
an
excellent
understanding
--
though
*NL*
I
am
not
certain
that
I
consider
her
marrying
Mr.
Collins
as
the
*NL*
wisest
thing
she
ever
did
.
She
seems
perfectly
happy
,
however
,
and
in
a
*NL*
prudential
light
it
is
certainly
a
very
good
match
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
very
agreeable
for
her
to
be
settled
within
so
easy
a
*NL*
distance
of
her
own
family
and
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
easy
distance
,
do
you
call
it
?
It
is
nearly
fifty
miles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
fifty
miles
of
good
road
?
Little
more
than
half
a
day
's
*NL*
journey
.
Yes
,
I
call
it
a
_
very
_
easy
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
never
have
considered
the
distance
as
one
of
the
_
advantages
_
*NL*
of
the
match
,
''
cried
Elizabeth
.
``
I
should
never
have
said
Mrs.
Collins
*NL*
was
settled
_
near
_
her
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
proof
of
your
own
attachment
to
Hertfordshire
.
Anything
beyond
*NL*
the
very
neighbourhood
of
Longbourn
,
I
suppose
,
would
appear
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
there
was
a
sort
of
smile
which
Elizabeth
fancied
she
*NL*
understood
;
he
must
be
supposing
her
to
be
thinking
of
Jane
and
*NL*
Netherfield
,
and
she
blushed
as
she
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
a
woman
may
not
be
settled
too
near
her
*NL*
family
.
The
far
and
the
near
must
be
relative
,
and
depend
on
many
*NL*
varying
circumstances
.
Where
there
is
fortune
to
make
the
expenses
of
*NL*
travelling
unimportant
,
distance
becomes
no
evil
.
But
that
is
not
the
*NL*
case
_
here
_
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Collins
have
a
comfortable
income
,
but
not
*NL*
such
a
one
as
will
allow
of
frequent
journeys
--
and
I
am
persuaded
my
*NL*
friend
would
not
call
herself
_
near
_
her
family
under
less
than
_
half
_
*NL*
the
present
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
drew
his
chair
a
little
towards
her
,
and
said
,
''
_
You
_
can
not
*NL*
have
a
right
to
such
very
strong
local
attachment
.
_
You
_
can
not
have
*NL*
been
always
at
Longbourn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
looked
surprised
.
The
gentleman
experienced
some
change
of
*NL*
feeling
;
he
drew
back
his
chair
,
took
a
newspaper
from
the
table
,
and
*NL*
glancing
over
it
,
said
,
in
a
colder
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
pleased
with
Kent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
dialogue
on
the
subject
of
the
country
ensued
,
on
either
side
*NL*
calm
and
concise
--
and
soon
put
an
end
to
by
the
entrance
of
Charlotte
*NL*
and
her
sister
,
just
returned
from
her
walk
.
The
tete-a-tete
surprised
*NL*
them
.
Mr.
Darcy
related
the
mistake
which
had
occasioned
his
intruding
*NL*
on
Miss
Bennet
,
and
after
sitting
a
few
minutes
longer
without
saying
*NL*
much
to
anybody
,
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
?
''
said
Charlotte
,
as
soon
as
he
was
*NL*
gone
.
``
My
dear
,
Eliza
,
he
must
be
in
love
with
you
,
or
he
would
never
*NL*
have
called
us
in
this
familiar
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Elizabeth
told
of
his
silence
,
it
did
not
seem
very
likely
,
*NL*
even
to
Charlotte
's
wishes
,
to
be
the
case
;
and
after
various
*NL*
conjectures
,
they
could
at
last
only
suppose
his
visit
to
proceed
from
*NL*
the
difficulty
of
finding
anything
to
do
,
which
was
the
more
probable
*NL*
from
the
time
of
year
.
All
field
sports
were
over
.
Within
doors
there
*NL*
was
Lady
Catherine
,
books
,
and
a
billiard-table
,
but
gentlemen
can
not
*NL*
always
be
within
doors
;
and
in
the
nearness
of
the
Parsonage
,
or
the
*NL*
pleasantness
of
the
walk
to
it
,
or
of
the
people
who
lived
in
it
,
the
*NL*
two
cousins
found
a
temptation
from
this
period
of
walking
thither
*NL*
almost
every
day
.
They
called
at
various
times
of
the
morning
,
sometimes
*NL*
separately
,
sometimes
together
,
and
now
and
then
accompanied
by
their
*NL*
aunt
.
It
was
plain
to
them
all
that
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
came
because
he
*NL*
had
pleasure
in
their
society
,
a
persuasion
which
of
course
recommended
*NL*
him
still
more
;
and
Elizabeth
was
reminded
by
her
own
satisfaction
in
*NL*
being
with
him
,
as
well
as
by
his
evident
admiration
of
her
,
of
her
*NL*
former
favourite
George
Wickham
;
and
though
,
in
comparing
them
,
she
saw
*NL*
there
was
less
captivating
softness
in
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
's
manners
,
*NL*
she
believed
he
might
have
the
best
informed
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
why
Mr.
Darcy
came
so
often
to
the
Parsonage
,
it
was
more
difficult
*NL*
to
understand
.
It
could
not
be
for
society
,
as
he
frequently
sat
there
*NL*
ten
minutes
together
without
opening
his
lips
;
and
when
he
did
speak
,
*NL*
it
seemed
the
effect
of
necessity
rather
than
of
choice
--
a
sacrifice
*NL*
to
propriety
,
not
a
pleasure
to
himself
.
He
seldom
appeared
really
*NL*
animated
.
Mrs.
Collins
knew
not
what
to
make
of
him
.
Colonel
*NL*
Fitzwilliam
's
occasionally
laughing
at
his
stupidity
,
proved
that
he
was
*NL*
generally
different
,
which
her
own
knowledge
of
him
could
not
have
told
*NL*
her
;
and
as
she
would
liked
to
have
believed
this
change
the
effect
*NL*
of
love
,
and
the
object
of
that
love
her
friend
Eliza
,
she
set
herself
*NL*
seriously
to
work
to
find
it
out
.
She
watched
him
whenever
they
were
at
*NL*
Rosings
,
and
whenever
he
came
to
Hunsford
;
but
without
much
success
.
He
*NL*
certainly
looked
at
her
friend
a
great
deal
,
but
the
expression
of
that
*NL*
look
was
disputable
.
It
was
an
earnest
,
steadfast
gaze
,
but
she
often
*NL*
doubted
whether
there
were
much
admiration
in
it
,
and
sometimes
it
*NL*
seemed
nothing
but
absence
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
once
or
twice
suggested
to
Elizabeth
the
possibility
of
his
*NL*
being
partial
to
her
,
but
Elizabeth
always
laughed
at
the
idea
;
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Collins
did
not
think
it
right
to
press
the
subject
,
from
the
danger
of
*NL*
raising
expectations
which
might
only
end
in
disappointment
;
for
in
her
*NL*
opinion
it
admitted
not
of
a
doubt
,
that
all
her
friend
's
dislike
would
*NL*
vanish
,
if
she
could
suppose
him
to
be
in
her
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
kind
schemes
for
Elizabeth
,
she
sometimes
planned
her
marrying
*NL*
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
.
He
was
beyond
comparison
the
most
pleasant
man
;
he
*NL*
certainly
admired
her
,
and
his
situation
in
life
was
most
eligible
;
but
,
*NL*
to
counterbalance
these
advantages
,
Mr.
Darcy
had
considerable
patronage
*NL*
in
the
church
,
and
his
cousin
could
have
none
at
all
.

Chapter
33
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
once
did
Elizabeth
,
in
her
ramble
within
the
park
,
*NL*
unexpectedly
meet
Mr.
Darcy
.
She
felt
all
the
perverseness
of
the
*NL*
mischance
that
should
bring
him
where
no
one
else
was
brought
,
and
,
to
*NL*
prevent
its
ever
happening
again
,
took
care
to
inform
him
at
first
that
*NL*
it
was
a
favourite
haunt
of
hers
.
How
it
could
occur
a
second
time
,
*NL*
therefore
,
was
very
odd
!
Yet
it
did
,
and
even
a
third
.
It
seemed
like
*NL*
wilful
ill-nature
,
or
a
voluntary
penance
,
for
on
these
occasions
it
was
*NL*
not
merely
a
few
formal
inquiries
and
an
awkward
pause
and
then
away
,
*NL*
but
he
actually
thought
it
necessary
to
turn
back
and
walk
with
her
.
He
*NL*
never
said
a
great
deal
,
nor
did
she
give
herself
the
trouble
of
talking
*NL*
or
of
listening
much
;
but
it
struck
her
in
the
course
of
their
third
*NL*
rencontre
that
he
was
asking
some
odd
unconnected
questions
--
about
*NL*
her
pleasure
in
being
at
Hunsford
,
her
love
of
solitary
walks
,
and
her
*NL*
opinion
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Collins
's
happiness
;
and
that
in
speaking
of
*NL*
Rosings
and
her
not
perfectly
understanding
the
house
,
he
seemed
to
*NL*
expect
that
whenever
she
came
into
Kent
again
she
would
be
staying
*NL*
_
there
_
too
.
His
words
seemed
to
imply
it
.
Could
he
have
Colonel
*NL*
Fitzwilliam
in
his
thoughts
?
She
supposed
,
if
he
meant
anything
,
he
must
*NL*
mean
an
allusion
to
what
might
arise
in
that
quarter
.
It
distressed
*NL*
her
a
little
,
and
she
was
quite
glad
to
find
herself
at
the
gate
in
the
*NL*
pales
opposite
the
Parsonage
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
engaged
one
day
as
she
walked
,
in
perusing
Jane
's
last
letter
,
*NL*
and
dwelling
on
some
passages
which
proved
that
Jane
had
not
written
in
*NL*
spirits
,
when
,
instead
of
being
again
surprised
by
Mr.
Darcy
,
she
saw
*NL*
on
looking
up
that
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
was
meeting
her
.
Putting
away
the
*NL*
letter
immediately
and
forcing
a
smile
,
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
before
that
you
ever
walked
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
making
the
tour
of
the
park
,
''
he
replied
,
``
as
I
generally
*NL*
do
every
year
,
and
intend
to
close
it
with
a
call
at
the
Parsonage
.
Are
*NL*
you
going
much
farther
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
should
have
turned
in
a
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
accordingly
she
did
turn
,
and
they
walked
towards
the
Parsonage
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
certainly
leave
Kent
on
Saturday
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
if
Darcy
does
not
put
it
off
again
.
But
I
am
at
his
disposal
.
He
*NL*
arranges
the
business
just
as
he
pleases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
not
able
to
please
himself
in
the
arrangement
,
he
has
at
least
*NL*
pleasure
in
the
great
power
of
choice
.
I
do
not
know
anybody
who
seems
*NL*
more
to
enjoy
the
power
of
doing
what
he
likes
than
Mr.
Darcy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
likes
to
have
his
own
way
very
well
,
''
replied
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
.
*NL*
``
But
so
we
all
do
.
It
is
only
that
he
has
better
means
of
having
it
*NL*
than
many
others
,
because
he
is
rich
,
and
many
others
are
poor
.
I
speak
*NL*
feelingly
.
A
younger
son
,
you
know
,
must
be
inured
to
self-denial
and
*NL*
dependence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
opinion
,
the
younger
son
of
an
earl
can
know
very
little
of
*NL*
either
.
Now
seriously
,
what
have
you
ever
known
of
self-denial
and
*NL*
dependence
?
When
have
you
been
prevented
by
want
of
money
from
going
*NL*
wherever
you
chose
,
or
procuring
anything
you
had
a
fancy
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
home
questions
--
and
perhaps
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
*NL*
experienced
many
hardships
of
that
nature
.
But
in
matters
of
greater
*NL*
weight
,
I
may
suffer
from
want
of
money
.
Younger
sons
can
not
marry
where
*NL*
they
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
where
they
like
women
of
fortune
,
which
I
think
they
very
often
*NL*
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
habits
of
expense
make
us
too
dependent
,
and
there
are
not
many
*NL*
in
my
rank
of
life
who
can
afford
to
marry
without
some
attention
to
*NL*
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
,
''
thought
Elizabeth
,
``
meant
for
me
?
''
and
she
coloured
at
the
*NL*
idea
;
but
,
recovering
herself
,
said
in
a
lively
tone
,
``
And
pray
,
what
*NL*
is
the
usual
price
of
an
earl
's
younger
son
?
Unless
the
elder
brother
is
*NL*
very
sickly
,
I
suppose
you
would
not
ask
above
fifty
thousand
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
her
in
the
same
style
,
and
the
subject
dropped
.
To
interrupt
*NL*
a
silence
which
might
make
him
fancy
her
affected
with
what
had
passed
,
*NL*
she
soon
afterwards
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
your
cousin
brought
you
down
with
him
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
having
someone
at
his
disposal
.
I
wonder
he
does
not
marry
,
to
secure
a
*NL*
lasting
convenience
of
that
kind
.
But
,
perhaps
,
his
sister
does
as
well
*NL*
for
the
present
,
and
,
as
she
is
under
his
sole
care
,
he
may
do
what
he
*NL*
likes
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
``
that
is
an
advantage
which
he
must
*NL*
divide
with
me
.
I
am
joined
with
him
in
the
guardianship
of
Miss
Darcy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
indeed
?
And
pray
what
sort
of
guardians
do
you
make
?
Does
your
*NL*
charge
give
you
much
trouble
?
Young
ladies
of
her
age
are
sometimes
a
*NL*
little
difficult
to
manage
,
and
if
she
has
the
true
Darcy
spirit
,
she
*NL*
may
like
to
have
her
own
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
she
observed
him
looking
at
her
earnestly
;
and
the
manner
*NL*
in
which
he
immediately
asked
her
why
she
supposed
Miss
Darcy
likely
to
*NL*
give
them
any
uneasiness
,
convinced
her
that
she
had
somehow
or
other
*NL*
got
pretty
near
the
truth
.
She
directly
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
be
frightened

I
never
heard
any
harm
of
her
;

I
dare
*NL*
say
she
is
one
of
the
most
tractable
creatures
in
the
world
.
She
is
a
*NL*
very
great
favourite
with
some
ladies
of
my
acquaintance
,
Mrs.
Hurst
and
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
.
I
think
I
have
heard
you
say
that
you
know
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
them
a
little
.
Their
brother
is
a
pleasant
gentlemanlike
man
--
he
*NL*
is
a
great
friend
of
Darcy
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
,
''
said
Elizabeth
drily
;
``
Mr.
Darcy
is
uncommonly
kind
to
Mr.
*NL*
Bingley
,
and
takes
a
prodigious
deal
of
care
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Care
of
him
!
Yes
,
I
really
believe
Darcy
_
does
_
take
care
of
him
in
*NL*
those
points
where
he
most
wants
care
.
From
something
that
he
told
me
in
*NL*
our
journey
hither
,
I
have
reason
to
think
Bingley
very
much
indebted
to
*NL*
him
.
But
I
ought
to
beg
his
pardon
,
for
I
have
no
right
to
suppose
that
*NL*
Bingley
was
the
person
meant
.
It
was
all
conjecture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
circumstance
which
Darcy
could
not
wish
to
be
generally
known
,
*NL*
because
if
it
were
to
get
round
to
the
lady
's
family
,
it
would
be
an
*NL*
unpleasant
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
depend
upon
my
not
mentioning
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
remember
that
I
have
not
much
reason
for
supposing
it
to
be
*NL*
Bingley
.
What
he
told
me
was
merely
this
:
that
he
congratulated
himself
*NL*
on
having
lately
saved
a
friend
from
the
inconveniences
of
a
most
*NL*
imprudent
marriage
,
but
without
mentioning
names
or
any
other
*NL*
particulars
,
and
I
only
suspected
it
to
be
Bingley
from
believing
*NL*
him
the
kind
of
young
man
to
get
into
a
scrape
of
that
sort
,
and
from
*NL*
knowing
them
to
have
been
together
the
whole
of
last
summer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Mr.
Darcy
give
you
reasons
for
this
interference
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understood
that
there
were
some
very
strong
objections
against
the
*NL*
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
arts
did
he
use
to
separate
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
talk
to
me
of
his
own
arts
,
''
said
Fitzwilliam
,
smiling
.
``
He
*NL*
only
told
me
what
I
have
now
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
made
no
answer
,
and
walked
on
,
her
heart
swelling
with
*NL*
indignation
.
After
watching
her
a
little
,
Fitzwilliam
asked
her
why
she
*NL*
was
so
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thinking
of
what
you
have
been
telling
me
,
''
said
she
.
``
Your
*NL*
cousin
's
conduct
does
not
suit
my
feelings
.
Why
was
he
to
be
the
judge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
rather
disposed
to
call
his
interference
officious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
see
what
right
Mr.
Darcy
had
to
decide
on
the
propriety
of
his
*NL*
friend
's
inclination
,
or
why
,
upon
his
own
judgement
alone
,
he
was
to
*NL*
determine
and
direct
in
what
manner
his
friend
was
to
be
happy
.
*NL*
But
,
''
she
continued
,
recollecting
herself
,
``
as
we
know
none
of
the
*NL*
particulars
,
it
is
not
fair
to
condemn
him
.
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
*NL*
that
there
was
much
affection
in
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
an
unnatural
surmise
,
''
said
Fitzwilliam
,
``
but
it
is
a
*NL*
lessening
of
the
honour
of
my
cousin
's
triumph
very
sadly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
spoken
jestingly
;
but
it
appeared
to
her
so
just
a
picture
*NL*
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
that
she
would
not
trust
herself
with
an
answer
,
and
*NL*
therefore
,
abruptly
changing
the
conversation
talked
on
indifferent
*NL*
matters
until
they
reached
the
Parsonage
.
There
,
shut
into
her
own
room
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
their
visitor
left
them
,
she
could
think
without
interruption
*NL*
of
all
that
she
had
heard
.
It
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
other
*NL*
people
could
be
meant
than
those
with
whom
she
was
connected
.
There
*NL*
could
not
exist
in
the
world
_
two
_
men
over
whom
Mr.
Darcy
could
have
*NL*
such
boundless
influence
.
That
he
had
been
concerned
in
the
measures
*NL*
taken
to
separate
Bingley
and
Jane
she
had
never
doubted
;
but
she
had
*NL*
always
attributed
to
Miss
Bingley
the
principal
design
and
arrangement
*NL*
of
them
.
If
his
own
vanity
,
however
,
did
not
mislead
him
,
_
he
_
was
*NL*
the
cause
,
his
pride
and
caprice
were
the
cause
,
of
all
that
Jane
had
*NL*
suffered
,
and
still
continued
to
suffer
.
He
had
ruined
for
a
while
*NL*
every
hope
of
happiness
for
the
most
affectionate
,
generous
heart
in
the
*NL*
world
;
and
no
one
could
say
how
lasting
an
evil
he
might
have
inflicted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
were
some
very
strong
objections
against
the
lady
,
''
were
Colonel
*NL*
Fitzwilliam
's
words
;
and
those
strong
objections
probably
were
,
her
*NL*
having
one
uncle
who
was
a
country
attorney
,
and
another
who
was
in
*NL*
business
in
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Jane
herself
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
*NL*
objection
;
all
loveliness
and
goodness
as
she
is
!
--
her
understanding
*NL*
excellent
,
her
mind
improved
,
and
her
manners
captivating
.
Neither
*NL*
could
anything
be
urged
against
my
father
,
who
,
though
with
some
*NL*
peculiarities
,
has
abilities
Mr.
Darcy
himself
need
not
disdain
,
and
*NL*
respectability
which
he
will
probably
never
reach
.
''
When
she
thought
of
*NL*
her
mother
,
her
confidence
gave
way
a
little
;
but
she
would
not
allow
*NL*
that
any
objections
_
there
_
had
material
weight
with
Mr.
Darcy
,
whose
*NL*
pride
,
she
was
convinced
,
would
receive
a
deeper
wound
from
the
want
of
*NL*
importance
in
his
friend
's
connections
,
than
from
their
want
of
sense
;
*NL*
and
she
was
quite
decided
,
at
last
,
that
he
had
been
partly
governed
*NL*
by
this
worst
kind
of
pride
,
and
partly
by
the
wish
of
retaining
Mr.
*NL*
Bingley
for
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
agitation
and
tears
which
the
subject
occasioned
,
brought
on
a
*NL*
headache
;
and
it
grew
so
much
worse
towards
the
evening
,
that
,
added
to
*NL*
her
unwillingness
to
see
Mr.
Darcy
,
it
determined
her
not
to
attend
her
*NL*
cousins
to
Rosings
,
where
they
were
engaged
to
drink
tea
.
Mrs.
Collins
,
*NL*
seeing
that
she
was
really
unwell
,
did
not
press
her
to
go
and
as
much
*NL*
as
possible
prevented
her
husband
from
pressing
her
;
but
Mr.
Collins
*NL*
could
not
conceal
his
apprehension
of
Lady
Catherine
's
being
rather
*NL*
displeased
by
her
staying
at
home
.

Chapter
34
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
gone
,
Elizabeth
,
as
if
intending
to
exasperate
herself
*NL*
as
much
as
possible
against
Mr.
Darcy
,
chose
for
her
employment
the
*NL*
examination
of
all
the
letters
which
Jane
had
written
to
her
since
her
*NL*
being
in
Kent
.
They
contained
no
actual
complaint
,
nor
was
there
any
*NL*
revival
of
past
occurrences
,
or
any
communication
of
present
suffering
.
*NL*
But
in
all
,
and
in
almost
every
line
of
each
,
there
was
a
want
of
that
*NL*
cheerfulness
which
had
been
used
to
characterise
her
style
,
and
which
,
*NL*
proceeding
from
the
serenity
of
a
mind
at
ease
with
itself
and
kindly
*NL*
disposed
towards
everyone
,
had
been
scarcely
ever
clouded
.
Elizabeth
*NL*
noticed
every
sentence
conveying
the
idea
of
uneasiness
,
with
an
*NL*
attention
which
it
had
hardly
received
on
the
first
perusal
.
Mr.
Darcy
's
*NL*
shameful
boast
of
what
misery
he
had
been
able
to
inflict
,
gave
her
*NL*
a
keener
sense
of
her
sister
's
sufferings
.
It
was
some
consolation
*NL*
to
think
that
his
visit
to
Rosings
was
to
end
on
the
day
after
the
*NL*
next
--
and
,
a
still
greater
,
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
she
should
*NL*
herself
be
with
Jane
again
,
and
enabled
to
contribute
to
the
recovery
of
*NL*
her
spirits
,
by
all
that
affection
could
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
think
of
Darcy
's
leaving
Kent
without
remembering
that
*NL*
his
cousin
was
to
go
with
him
;
but
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
had
made
it
clear
*NL*
that
he
had
no
intentions
at
all
,
and
agreeable
as
he
was
,
she
did
not
*NL*
mean
to
be
unhappy
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
settling
this
point
,
she
was
suddenly
roused
by
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
door-bell
,
and
her
spirits
were
a
little
fluttered
by
the
idea
of
its
*NL*
being
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
himself
,
who
had
once
before
called
late
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
and
might
now
come
to
inquire
particularly
after
her
.
*NL*
But
this
idea
was
soon
banished
,
and
her
spirits
were
very
differently
*NL*
affected
,
when
,
to
her
utter
amazement
,
she
saw
Mr.
Darcy
walk
into
the
*NL*
room
.
In
an
hurried
manner
he
immediately
began
an
inquiry
after
her
*NL*
health
,
imputing
his
visit
to
a
wish
of
hearing
that
she
were
better
.
*NL*
She
answered
him
with
cold
civility
.
He
sat
down
for
a
few
moments
,
and
*NL*
then
getting
up
,
walked
about
the
room
.
Elizabeth
was
surprised
,
but
*NL*
said
not
a
word
.
After
a
silence
of
several
minutes
,
he
came
towards
her
*NL*
in
an
agitated
manner
,
and
thus
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
vain
I
have
struggled
.
It
will
not
do
.
My
feelings
will
not
be
*NL*
repressed
.
You
must
allow
me
to
tell
you
how
ardently
I
admire
and
love
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
astonishment
was
beyond
expression
.
She
stared
,
coloured
,
*NL*
doubted
,
and
was
silent
.
This
he
considered
sufficient
encouragement
;
*NL*
and
the
avowal
of
all
that
he
felt
,
and
had
long
felt
for
her
,
*NL*
immediately
followed
.
He
spoke
well
;
but
there
were
feelings
besides
*NL*
those
of
the
heart
to
be
detailed
;
and
he
was
not
more
eloquent
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
tenderness
than
of
pride
.
His
sense
of
her
inferiority
--
of
*NL*
its
being
a
degradation
--
of
the
family
obstacles
which
had
always
*NL*
opposed
to
inclination
,
were
dwelt
on
with
a
warmth
which
seemed
due
to
*NL*
the
consequence
he
was
wounding
,
but
was
very
unlikely
to
recommend
his
*NL*
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
her
deeply-rooted
dislike
,
she
could
not
be
insensible
to
*NL*
the
compliment
of
such
a
man
's
affection
,
and
though
her
intentions
did
*NL*
not
vary
for
an
instant
,
she
was
at
first
sorry
for
the
pain
he
was
to
*NL*
receive
;
till
,
roused
to
resentment
by
his
subsequent
language
,
she
*NL*
lost
all
compassion
in
anger
.
She
tried
,
however
,
to
compose
herself
to
*NL*
answer
him
with
patience
,
when
he
should
have
done
.
He
concluded
with
*NL*
representing
to
her
the
strength
of
that
attachment
which
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
all
his
endeavours
,
he
had
found
impossible
to
conquer
;
and
with
*NL*
expressing
his
hope
that
it
would
now
be
rewarded
by
her
acceptance
of
*NL*
his
hand
.
As
he
said
this
,
she
could
easily
see
that
he
had
no
doubt
*NL*
of
a
favourable
answer
.
He
_
spoke
_
of
apprehension
and
anxiety
,
but
*NL*
his
countenance
expressed
real
security
.
Such
a
circumstance
could
*NL*
only
exasperate
farther
,
and
,
when
he
ceased
,
the
colour
rose
into
her
*NL*
cheeks
,
and
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
such
cases
as
this
,
it
is
,
I
believe
,
the
established
mode
to
*NL*
express
a
sense
of
obligation
for
the
sentiments
avowed
,
however
*NL*
unequally
they
may
be
returned
.
It
is
natural
that
obligation
should
*NL*
be
felt
,
and
if
I
could
_
feel
_
gratitude
,
I
would
now
thank
you
.
But
I
*NL*
can
not
--
I
have
never
desired
your
good
opinion
,
and
you
have
certainly
*NL*
bestowed
it
most
unwillingly
.
I
am
sorry
to
have
occasioned
pain
to
*NL*
anyone
.
It
has
been
most
unconsciously
done
,
however
,
and
I
hope
will
be
*NL*
of
short
duration
.
The
feelings
which
,
you
tell
me
,
have
long
prevented
*NL*
the
acknowledgment
of
your
regard
,
can
have
little
difficulty
in
*NL*
overcoming
it
after
this
explanation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
,
who
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
with
his
eyes
fixed
*NL*
on
her
face
,
seemed
to
catch
her
words
with
no
less
resentment
than
*NL*
surprise
.
His
complexion
became
pale
with
anger
,
and
the
disturbance
*NL*
of
his
mind
was
visible
in
every
feature
.
He
was
struggling
for
the
*NL*
appearance
of
composure
,
and
would
not
open
his
lips
till
he
believed
*NL*
himself
to
have
attained
it
.
The
pause
was
to
Elizabeth
's
feelings
*NL*
dreadful
.
At
length
,
with
a
voice
of
forced
calmness
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
all
the
reply
which
I
am
to
have
the
honour
of
expecting
!
*NL*
I
might
,
perhaps
,
wish
to
be
informed
why
,
with
so
little
_
endeavour
_
at
*NL*
civility
,
I
am
thus
rejected
.
But
it
is
of
small
importance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
as
well
inquire
,
''
replied
she
,
``
why
with
so
evident
a
desire
*NL*
of
offending
and
insulting
me
,
you
chose
to
tell
me
that
you
liked
me
*NL*
against
your
will
,
against
your
reason
,
and
even
against
your
character
?
*NL*
Was
not
this
some
excuse
for
incivility
,
if
I
_
was
_
uncivil
?
But
I
have
*NL*
other
provocations
.
You
know
I
have
.
Had
not
my
feelings
decided
against
*NL*
you
--
had
they
been
indifferent
,
or
had
they
even
been
favourable
,
do
you
*NL*
think
that
any
consideration
would
tempt
me
to
accept
the
man
who
has
*NL*
been
the
means
of
ruining
,
perhaps
for
ever
,
the
happiness
of
a
most
*NL*
beloved
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
pronounced
these
words
,
Mr.
Darcy
changed
colour
;
but
the
emotion
*NL*
was
short
,
and
he
listened
without
attempting
to
interrupt
her
while
she
*NL*
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
every
reason
in
the
world
to
think
ill
of
you
.
No
motive
can
*NL*
excuse
the
unjust
and
ungenerous
part
you
acted
_
there
_
.
You
dare
not
,
*NL*
you
can
not
deny
,
that
you
have
been
the
principal
,
if
not
the
only
means
*NL*
of
dividing
them
from
each
other
--
of
exposing
one
to
the
censure
of
the
*NL*
world
for
caprice
and
instability
,
and
the
other
to
its
derision
for
*NL*
disappointed
hopes
,
and
involving
them
both
in
misery
of
the
acutest
*NL*
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
and
saw
with
no
slight
indignation
that
he
was
listening
*NL*
with
an
air
which
proved
him
wholly
unmoved
by
any
feeling
of
remorse
.
*NL*
He
even
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
of
affected
incredulity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
deny
that
you
have
done
it
?
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
assumed
tranquillity
he
then
replied
:
``
I
have
no
wish
of
denying
*NL*
that
I
did
everything
in
my
power
to
separate
my
friend
from
your
*NL*
sister
,
or
that
I
rejoice
in
my
success
.
Towards
_
him
_
I
have
been
*NL*
kinder
than
towards
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
disdained
the
appearance
of
noticing
this
civil
reflection
,
*NL*
but
its
meaning
did
not
escape
,
nor
was
it
likely
to
conciliate
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
not
merely
this
affair
,
''
she
continued
,
``
on
which
my
dislike
*NL*
is
founded
.
Long
before
it
had
taken
place
my
opinion
of
you
was
*NL*
decided
.
Your
character
was
unfolded
in
the
recital
which
I
received
*NL*
many
months
ago
from
Mr.
Wickham
.
On
this
subject
,
what
can
you
have
to
*NL*
say
?
In
what
imaginary
act
of
friendship
can
you
here
defend
yourself
?
*NL*
or
under
what
misrepresentation
can
you
here
impose
upon
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
take
an
eager
interest
in
that
gentleman
's
concerns
,
''
said
Darcy
,
*NL*
in
a
less
tranquil
tone
,
and
with
a
heightened
colour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
that
knows
what
his
misfortunes
have
been
,
can
help
feeling
an
*NL*
interest
in
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
misfortunes
!
''
repeated
Darcy
contemptuously
;
``
yes
,
his
misfortunes
*NL*
have
been
great
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
of
your
infliction
,
''
cried
Elizabeth
with
energy
.
``
You
have
reduced
*NL*
him
to
his
present
state
of
poverty
--
comparative
poverty
.
You
have
*NL*
withheld
the
advantages
which
you
must
know
to
have
been
designed
for
*NL*
him
.
You
have
deprived
the
best
years
of
his
life
of
that
independence
*NL*
which
was
no
less
his
due
than
his
desert
.
You
have
done
all
this
!
*NL*
and
yet
you
can
treat
the
mention
of
his
misfortune
with
contempt
and
*NL*
ridicule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
,
''
cried
Darcy
,
as
he
walked
with
quick
steps
across
the
room
,
*NL*
``
is
your
opinion
of
me
!
This
is
the
estimation
in
which
you
hold
me
!
*NL*
I
thank
you
for
explaining
it
so
fully
.
My
faults
,
according
to
this
*NL*
calculation
,
are
heavy
indeed
!
But
perhaps
,
''
added
he
,
stopping
in
*NL*
his
walk
,
and
turning
towards
her
,
``
these
offenses
might
have
been
*NL*
overlooked
,
had
not
your
pride
been
hurt
by
my
honest
confession
of
the
*NL*
scruples
that
had
long
prevented
my
forming
any
serious
design
.
These
*NL*
bitter
accusations
might
have
been
suppressed
,
had
I
,
with
greater
*NL*
policy
,
concealed
my
struggles
,
and
flattered
you
into
the
belief
of
*NL*
my
being
impelled
by
unqualified
,
unalloyed
inclination
;
by
reason
,
by
*NL*
reflection
,
by
everything
.
But
disguise
of
every
sort
is
my
abhorrence
.
*NL*
Nor
am
I
ashamed
of
the
feelings
I
related
.
They
were
natural
and
*NL*
just
.
Could
you
expect
me
to
rejoice
in
the
inferiority
of
your
*NL*
connections
?
--
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
hope
of
relations
,
whose
*NL*
condition
in
life
is
so
decidedly
beneath
my
own
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
felt
herself
growing
more
angry
every
moment
;
yet
she
tried
to
*NL*
the
utmost
to
speak
with
composure
when
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
if
you
suppose
that
the
mode
of
your
*NL*
declaration
affected
me
in
any
other
way
,
than
as
it
spared
me
the
concern
*NL*
which
I
might
have
felt
in
refusing
you
,
had
you
behaved
in
a
more
*NL*
gentlemanlike
manner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
him
start
at
this
,
but
he
said
nothing
,
and
she
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
not
have
made
the
offer
of
your
hand
in
any
possible
way
that
*NL*
would
have
tempted
me
to
accept
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
his
astonishment
was
obvious
;
and
he
looked
at
her
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
mingled
incredulity
and
mortification
.
She
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
very
beginning
--
from
the
first
moment
,
I
may
almost
say
--
of
*NL*
my
acquaintance
with
you
,
your
manners
,
impressing
me
with
the
fullest
*NL*
belief
of
your
arrogance
,
your
conceit
,
and
your
selfish
disdain
of
*NL*
the
feelings
of
others
,
were
such
as
to
form
the
groundwork
of
*NL*
disapprobation
on
which
succeeding
events
have
built
so
immovable
a
*NL*
dislike
;
and
I
had
not
known
you
a
month
before
I
felt
that
you
were
the
*NL*
last
man
in
the
world
whom
I
could
ever
be
prevailed
on
to
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
said
quite
enough
,
madam
.
I
perfectly
comprehend
your
*NL*
feelings
,
and
have
now
only
to
be
ashamed
of
what
my
own
have
been
.
*NL*
Forgive
me
for
having
taken
up
so
much
of
your
time
,
and
accept
my
best
*NL*
wishes
for
your
health
and
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
these
words
he
hastily
left
the
room
,
and
Elizabeth
heard
him
*NL*
the
next
moment
open
the
front
door
and
quit
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tumult
of
her
mind
,
was
now
painfully
great
.
She
knew
not
how
*NL*
to
support
herself
,
and
from
actual
weakness
sat
down
and
cried
for
*NL*
half-an-hour
.
Her
astonishment
,
as
she
reflected
on
what
had
passed
,
*NL*
was
increased
by
every
review
of
it
.
That
she
should
receive
an
offer
of
*NL*
marriage
from
Mr.
Darcy
!
That
he
should
have
been
in
love
with
her
for
*NL*
so
many
months
!
So
much
in
love
as
to
wish
to
marry
her
in
spite
of
*NL*
all
the
objections
which
had
made
him
prevent
his
friend
's
marrying
*NL*
her
sister
,
and
which
must
appear
at
least
with
equal
force
in
his
*NL*
own
case
--
was
almost
incredible
!
It
was
gratifying
to
have
inspired
*NL*
unconsciously
so
strong
an
affection
.
But
his
pride
,
his
abominable
*NL*
pride
--
his
shameless
avowal
of
what
he
had
done
with
respect
to
*NL*
Jane
--
his
unpardonable
assurance
in
acknowledging
,
though
he
could
*NL*
not
justify
it
,
and
the
unfeeling
manner
in
which
he
had
mentioned
Mr.
*NL*
Wickham
,
his
cruelty
towards
whom
he
had
not
attempted
to
deny
,
soon
*NL*
overcame
the
pity
which
the
consideration
of
his
attachment
had
for
*NL*
a
moment
excited
.
She
continued
in
very
agitated
reflections
till
the
*NL*
sound
of
Lady
Catherine
's
carriage
made
her
feel
how
unequal
she
was
to
*NL*
encounter
Charlotte
's
observation
,
and
hurried
her
away
to
her
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
35
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
awoke
the
next
morning
to
the
same
thoughts
and
meditations
*NL*
which
had
at
length
closed
her
eyes
.
She
could
not
yet
recover
from
the
*NL*
surprise
of
what
had
happened
;
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
anything
*NL*
else
;
and
,
totally
indisposed
for
employment
,
she
resolved
,
soon
after
*NL*
breakfast
,
to
indulge
herself
in
air
and
exercise
.
She
was
proceeding
*NL*
directly
to
her
favourite
walk
,
when
the
recollection
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
*NL*
sometimes
coming
there
stopped
her
,
and
instead
of
entering
the
park
,
*NL*
she
turned
up
the
lane
,
which
led
farther
from
the
turnpike-road
.
The
*NL*
park
paling
was
still
the
boundary
on
one
side
,
and
she
soon
passed
one
*NL*
of
the
gates
into
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
walking
two
or
three
times
along
that
part
of
the
lane
,
she
was
*NL*
tempted
,
by
the
pleasantness
of
the
morning
,
to
stop
at
the
gates
and
*NL*
look
into
the
park
.
The
five
weeks
which
she
had
now
passed
in
Kent
had
*NL*
made
a
great
difference
in
the
country
,
and
every
day
was
adding
to
the
*NL*
verdure
of
the
early
trees
.
She
was
on
the
point
of
continuing
her
walk
,
*NL*
when
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
gentleman
within
the
sort
of
grove
which
*NL*
edged
the
park
;
he
was
moving
that
way
;
and
,
fearful
of
its
being
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
,
she
was
directly
retreating
.
But
the
person
who
advanced
was
now
*NL*
near
enough
to
see
her
,
and
stepping
forward
with
eagerness
,
pronounced
*NL*
her
name
.
She
had
turned
away
;
but
on
hearing
herself
called
,
though
*NL*
in
a
voice
which
proved
it
to
be
Mr.
Darcy
,
she
moved
again
towards
the
*NL*
gate
.
He
had
by
that
time
reached
it
also
,
and
,
holding
out
a
letter
,
*NL*
which
she
instinctively
took
,
said
,
with
a
look
of
haughty
composure
,
*NL*
``
I
have
been
walking
in
the
grove
some
time
in
the
hope
of
meeting
you
.
*NL*
Will
you
do
me
the
honour
of
reading
that
letter
?
''
And
then
,
with
a
*NL*
slight
bow
,
turned
again
into
the
plantation
,
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
no
expectation
of
pleasure
,
but
with
the
strongest
curiosity
,
*NL*
Elizabeth
opened
the
letter
,
and
,
to
her
still
increasing
wonder
,
*NL*
perceived
an
envelope
containing
two
sheets
of
letter-paper
,
written
*NL*
quite
through
,
in
a
very
close
hand
.
The
envelope
itself
was
likewise
*NL*
full
.
Pursuing
her
way
along
the
lane
,
she
then
began
it
.
It
was
dated
*NL*
from
Rosings
,
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
was
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not
alarmed
,
madam
,
on
receiving
this
letter
,
by
the
apprehension
*NL*
of
its
containing
any
repetition
of
those
sentiments
or
renewal
of
those
*NL*
offers
which
were
last
night
so
disgusting
to
you
.
I
write
without
any
*NL*
intention
of
paining
you
,
or
humbling
myself
,
by
dwelling
on
wishes
*NL*
which
,
for
the
happiness
of
both
,
can
not
be
too
soon
forgotten
;
and
the
*NL*
effort
which
the
formation
and
the
perusal
of
this
letter
must
occasion
,
*NL*
should
have
been
spared
,
had
not
my
character
required
it
to
be
written
*NL*
and
read
.
You
must
,
therefore
,
pardon
the
freedom
with
which
I
demand
*NL*
your
attention
;
your
feelings
,
I
know
,
will
bestow
it
unwillingly
,
but
I
*NL*
demand
it
of
your
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
offenses
of
a
very
different
nature
,
and
by
no
means
of
equal
*NL*
magnitude
,
you
last
night
laid
to
my
charge
.
The
first
mentioned
was
,
*NL*
that
,
regardless
of
the
sentiments
of
either
,
I
had
detached
Mr.
Bingley
*NL*
from
your
sister
,
and
the
other
,
that
I
had
,
in
defiance
of
various
*NL*
claims
,
in
defiance
of
honour
and
humanity
,
ruined
the
immediate
*NL*
prosperity
and
blasted
the
prospects
of
Mr.
Wickham
.
Wilfully
and
*NL*
wantonly
to
have
thrown
off
the
companion
of
my
youth
,
the
acknowledged
*NL*
favourite
of
my
father
,
a
young
man
who
had
scarcely
any
other
*NL*
dependence
than
on
our
patronage
,
and
who
had
been
brought
up
to
expect
*NL*
its
exertion
,
would
be
a
depravity
,
to
which
the
separation
of
two
young
*NL*
persons
,
whose
affection
could
be
the
growth
of
only
a
few
weeks
,
could
*NL*
bear
no
comparison
.
But
from
the
severity
of
that
blame
which
was
last
*NL*
night
so
liberally
bestowed
,
respecting
each
circumstance
,
I
shall
hope
*NL*
to
be
in
the
future
secured
,
when
the
following
account
of
my
actions
*NL*
and
their
motives
has
been
read
.
If
,
in
the
explanation
of
them
,
which
*NL*
is
due
to
myself
,
I
am
under
the
necessity
of
relating
feelings
which
*NL*
may
be
offensive
to
yours
,
I
can
only
say
that
I
am
sorry
.
The
necessity
*NL*
must
be
obeyed
,
and
further
apology
would
be
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
been
long
in
Hertfordshire
,
before
I
saw
,
in
common
with
*NL*
others
,
that
Bingley
preferred
your
elder
sister
to
any
other
young
*NL*
woman
in
the
country
.
But
it
was
not
till
the
evening
of
the
dance
*NL*
at
Netherfield
that
I
had
any
apprehension
of
his
feeling
a
serious
*NL*
attachment
.
I
had
often
seen
him
in
love
before
.
At
that
ball
,
while
I
*NL*
had
the
honour
of
dancing
with
you
,
I
was
first
made
acquainted
,
by
Sir
*NL*
William
Lucas
's
accidental
information
,
that
Bingley
's
attentions
to
*NL*
your
sister
had
given
rise
to
a
general
expectation
of
their
marriage
.
*NL*
He
spoke
of
it
as
a
certain
event
,
of
which
the
time
alone
could
*NL*
be
undecided
.
From
that
moment
I
observed
my
friend
's
behaviour
*NL*
attentively
;
and
I
could
then
perceive
that
his
partiality
for
Miss
*NL*
Bennet
was
beyond
what
I
had
ever
witnessed
in
him
.
Your
sister
I
also
*NL*
watched
.
Her
look
and
manners
were
open
,
cheerful
,
and
engaging
as
ever
,
*NL*
but
without
any
symptom
of
peculiar
regard
,
and
I
remained
convinced
*NL*
from
the
evening
's
scrutiny
,
that
though
she
received
his
attentions
*NL*
with
pleasure
,
she
did
not
invite
them
by
any
participation
of
*NL*
sentiment
.
If
_
you
_
have
not
been
mistaken
here
,
_
I
_
must
have
been
*NL*
in
error
.
Your
superior
knowledge
of
your
sister
must
make
the
latter
*NL*
probable
.
If
it
be
so
,
if
I
have
been
misled
by
such
error
to
inflict
*NL*
pain
on
her
,
your
resentment
has
not
been
unreasonable
.
But
I
shall
not
*NL*
scruple
to
assert
,
that
the
serenity
of
your
sister
's
countenance
and
*NL*
air
was
such
as
might
have
given
the
most
acute
observer
a
conviction
*NL*
that
,
however
amiable
her
temper
,
her
heart
was
not
likely
to
be
*NL*
easily
touched
.
That
I
was
desirous
of
believing
her
indifferent
is
*NL*
certain
--
but
I
will
venture
to
say
that
my
investigation
and
decisions
*NL*
are
not
usually
influenced
by
my
hopes
or
fears
.
I
did
not
believe
*NL*
her
to
be
indifferent
because
I
wished
it
;
I
believed
it
on
impartial
*NL*
conviction
,
as
truly
as
I
wished
it
in
reason
.
My
objections
to
the
*NL*
marriage
were
not
merely
those
which
I
last
night
acknowledged
to
have
*NL*
the
utmost
force
of
passion
to
put
aside
,
in
my
own
case
;
the
want
of
*NL*
connection
could
not
be
so
great
an
evil
to
my
friend
as
to
me
.
But
*NL*
there
were
other
causes
of
repugnance
;
causes
which
,
though
still
*NL*
existing
,
and
existing
to
an
equal
degree
in
both
instances
,
I
had
*NL*
myself
endeavoured
to
forget
,
because
they
were
not
immediately
before
*NL*
me
.
These
causes
must
be
stated
,
though
briefly
.
The
situation
of
your
*NL*
mother
's
family
,
though
objectionable
,
was
nothing
in
comparison
to
that
*NL*
total
want
of
propriety
so
frequently
,
so
almost
uniformly
betrayed
by
*NL*
herself
,
by
your
three
younger
sisters
,
and
occasionally
even
by
your
*NL*
father
.
Pardon
me
.
It
pains
me
to
offend
you
.
But
amidst
your
concern
*NL*
for
the
defects
of
your
nearest
relations
,
and
your
displeasure
at
this
*NL*
representation
of
them
,
let
it
give
you
consolation
to
consider
that
,
to
*NL*
have
conducted
yourselves
so
as
to
avoid
any
share
of
the
like
censure
,
*NL*
is
praise
no
less
generally
bestowed
on
you
and
your
elder
sister
,
than
*NL*
it
is
honourable
to
the
sense
and
disposition
of
both
.
I
will
only
say
*NL*
farther
that
from
what
passed
that
evening
,
my
opinion
of
all
parties
*NL*
was
confirmed
,
and
every
inducement
heightened
which
could
have
led
*NL*
me
before
,
to
preserve
my
friend
from
what
I
esteemed
a
most
unhappy
*NL*
connection
.
He
left
Netherfield
for
London
,
on
the
day
following
,
as
*NL*
you
,
I
am
certain
,
remember
,
with
the
design
of
soon
returning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
part
which
I
acted
is
now
to
be
explained
.
His
sisters
'
uneasiness
*NL*
had
been
equally
excited
with
my
own
;
our
coincidence
of
feeling
was
*NL*
soon
discovered
,
and
,
alike
sensible
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
in
*NL*
detaching
their
brother
,
we
shortly
resolved
on
joining
him
directly
in
*NL*
London
.
We
accordingly
went
--
and
there
I
readily
engaged
in
the
office
*NL*
of
pointing
out
to
my
friend
the
certain
evils
of
such
a
choice
.
I
*NL*
described
,
and
enforced
them
earnestly
.
But
,
however
this
remonstrance
*NL*
might
have
staggered
or
delayed
his
determination
,
I
do
not
suppose
*NL*
that
it
would
ultimately
have
prevented
the
marriage
,
had
it
not
been
*NL*
seconded
by
the
assurance
that
I
hesitated
not
in
giving
,
of
your
*NL*
sister
's
indifference
.
He
had
before
believed
her
to
return
his
*NL*
affection
with
sincere
,
if
not
with
equal
regard
.
But
Bingley
has
great
*NL*
natural
modesty
,
with
a
stronger
dependence
on
my
judgement
than
on
his
*NL*
own
.
To
convince
him
,
therefore
,
that
he
had
deceived
himself
,
was
*NL*
no
very
difficult
point
.
To
persuade
him
against
returning
into
*NL*
Hertfordshire
,
when
that
conviction
had
been
given
,
was
scarcely
the
*NL*
work
of
a
moment
.
I
can
not
blame
myself
for
having
done
thus
much
.
There
*NL*
is
but
one
part
of
my
conduct
in
the
whole
affair
on
which
I
do
not
*NL*
reflect
with
satisfaction
;
it
is
that
I
condescended
to
adopt
the
*NL*
measures
of
art
so
far
as
to
conceal
from
him
your
sister
's
being
in
*NL*
town
.
I
knew
it
myself
,
as
it
was
known
to
Miss
Bingley
;
but
her
*NL*
brother
is
even
yet
ignorant
of
it
.
That
they
might
have
met
without
*NL*
ill
consequence
is
perhaps
probable
;
but
his
regard
did
not
appear
to
me
*NL*
enough
extinguished
for
him
to
see
her
without
some
danger
.
Perhaps
this
*NL*
concealment
,
this
disguise
was
beneath
me
;
it
is
done
,
however
,
and
it
*NL*
was
done
for
the
best
.
On
this
subject
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
no
*NL*
other
apology
to
offer
.
If
I
have
wounded
your
sister
's
feelings
,
it
*NL*
was
unknowingly
done
and
though
the
motives
which
governed
me
may
to
*NL*
you
very
naturally
appear
insufficient
,
I
have
not
yet
learnt
to
condemn
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
respect
to
that
other
,
more
weighty
accusation
,
of
having
injured
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
,
I
can
only
refute
it
by
laying
before
you
the
whole
of
his
*NL*
connection
with
my
family
.
Of
what
he
has
_
particularly
_
accused
me
I
*NL*
am
ignorant
;
but
of
the
truth
of
what
I
shall
relate
,
I
can
summon
more
*NL*
than
one
witness
of
undoubted
veracity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wickham
is
the
son
of
a
very
respectable
man
,
who
had
for
many
*NL*
years
the
management
of
all
the
Pemberley
estates
,
and
whose
good
*NL*
conduct
in
the
discharge
of
his
trust
naturally
inclined
my
father
to
*NL*
be
of
service
to
him
;
and
on
George
Wickham
,
who
was
his
godson
,
his
*NL*
kindness
was
therefore
liberally
bestowed
.
My
father
supported
him
at
*NL*
school
,
and
afterwards
at
Cambridge
--
most
important
assistance
,
as
his
*NL*
own
father
,
always
poor
from
the
extravagance
of
his
wife
,
would
have
*NL*
been
unable
to
give
him
a
gentleman
's
education
.
My
father
was
not
only
*NL*
fond
of
this
young
man
's
society
,
whose
manners
were
always
engaging
;
he
*NL*
had
also
the
highest
opinion
of
him
,
and
hoping
the
church
would
be
*NL*
his
profession
,
intended
to
provide
for
him
in
it
.
As
for
myself
,
it
is
*NL*
many
,
many
years
since
I
first
began
to
think
of
him
in
a
very
different
*NL*
manner
.
The
vicious
propensities
--
the
want
of
principle
,
which
he
was
*NL*
careful
to
guard
from
the
knowledge
of
his
best
friend
,
could
not
escape
*NL*
the
observation
of
a
young
man
of
nearly
the
same
age
with
himself
,
*NL*
and
who
had
opportunities
of
seeing
him
in
unguarded
moments
,
which
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
could
not
have
.
Here
again
I
shall
give
you
pain
--
to
what
degree
*NL*
you
only
can
tell
.
But
whatever
may
be
the
sentiments
which
Mr.
Wickham
*NL*
has
created
,
a
suspicion
of
their
nature
shall
not
prevent
me
from
*NL*
unfolding
his
real
character
--
it
adds
even
another
motive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
excellent
father
died
about
five
years
ago
;
and
his
attachment
to
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
was
to
the
last
so
steady
,
that
in
his
will
he
particularly
*NL*
recommended
it
to
me
,
to
promote
his
advancement
in
the
best
manner
*NL*
that
his
profession
might
allow
--
and
if
he
took
orders
,
desired
that
a
*NL*
valuable
family
living
might
be
his
as
soon
as
it
became
vacant
.
There
*NL*
was
also
a
legacy
of
one
thousand
pounds
.
His
own
father
did
not
long
*NL*
survive
mine
,
and
within
half
a
year
from
these
events
,
Mr.
Wickham
*NL*
wrote
to
inform
me
that
,
having
finally
resolved
against
taking
orders
,
*NL*
he
hoped
I
should
not
think
it
unreasonable
for
him
to
expect
some
more
*NL*
immediate
pecuniary
advantage
,
in
lieu
of
the
preferment
,
by
which
he
*NL*
could
not
be
benefited
.
He
had
some
intention
,
he
added
,
of
studying
*NL*
law
,
and
I
must
be
aware
that
the
interest
of
one
thousand
pounds
would
*NL*
be
a
very
insufficient
support
therein
.
I
rather
wished
,
than
believed
*NL*
him
to
be
sincere
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
was
perfectly
ready
to
accede
to
*NL*
his
proposal
.
I
knew
that
Mr.
Wickham
ought
not
to
be
a
clergyman
;
the
*NL*
business
was
therefore
soon
settled
--
he
resigned
all
claim
to
assistance
*NL*
in
the
church
,
were
it
possible
that
he
could
ever
be
in
a
situation
to
*NL*
receive
it
,
and
accepted
in
return
three
thousand
pounds
.
All
connection
*NL*
between
us
seemed
now
dissolved
.
I
thought
too
ill
of
him
to
invite
him
*NL*
to
Pemberley
,
or
admit
his
society
in
town
.
In
town
I
believe
he
chiefly
*NL*
lived
,
but
his
studying
the
law
was
a
mere
pretence
,
and
being
now
free
*NL*
from
all
restraint
,
his
life
was
a
life
of
idleness
and
dissipation
.
*NL*
For
about
three
years
I
heard
little
of
him
;
but
on
the
decease
of
the
*NL*
incumbent
of
the
living
which
had
been
designed
for
him
,
he
applied
to
*NL*
me
again
by
letter
for
the
presentation
.
His
circumstances
,
he
assured
*NL*
me
,
and
I
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
it
,
were
exceedingly
bad
.
He
*NL*
had
found
the
law
a
most
unprofitable
study
,
and
was
now
absolutely
*NL*
resolved
on
being
ordained
,
if
I
would
present
him
to
the
living
in
*NL*
question
--
of
which
he
trusted
there
could
be
little
doubt
,
as
he
was
*NL*
well
assured
that
I
had
no
other
person
to
provide
for
,
and
I
could
not
*NL*
have
forgotten
my
revered
father
's
intentions
.
You
will
hardly
blame
*NL*
me
for
refusing
to
comply
with
this
entreaty
,
or
for
resisting
every
*NL*
repetition
to
it
.
His
resentment
was
in
proportion
to
the
distress
of
*NL*
his
circumstances
--
and
he
was
doubtless
as
violent
in
his
abuse
of
me
*NL*
to
others
as
in
his
reproaches
to
myself
.
After
this
period
every
*NL*
appearance
of
acquaintance
was
dropped
.
How
he
lived
I
know
not
.
But
*NL*
last
summer
he
was
again
most
painfully
obtruded
on
my
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
now
mention
a
circumstance
which
I
would
wish
to
forget
myself
,
*NL*
and
which
no
obligation
less
than
the
present
should
induce
me
to
unfold
*NL*
to
any
human
being
.
Having
said
thus
much
,
I
feel
no
doubt
of
your
*NL*
secrecy
.
My
sister
,
who
is
more
than
ten
years
my
junior
,
was
left
to
*NL*
the
guardianship
of
my
mother
's
nephew
,
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
and
myself
.
*NL*
About
a
year
ago
,
she
was
taken
from
school
,
and
an
establishment
formed
*NL*
for
her
in
London
;
and
last
summer
she
went
with
the
lady
who
presided
*NL*
over
it
,
to
Ramsgate
;
and
thither
also
went
Mr.
Wickham
,
undoubtedly
by
*NL*
design
;
for
there
proved
to
have
been
a
prior
acquaintance
between
him
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Younge
,
in
whose
character
we
were
most
unhappily
deceived
;
and
*NL*
by
her
connivance
and
aid
,
he
so
far
recommended
himself
to
Georgiana
,
*NL*
whose
affectionate
heart
retained
a
strong
impression
of
his
kindness
to
*NL*
her
as
a
child
,
that
she
was
persuaded
to
believe
herself
in
love
,
and
*NL*
to
consent
to
an
elopement
.
She
was
then
but
fifteen
,
which
must
be
her
*NL*
excuse
;
and
after
stating
her
imprudence
,
I
am
happy
to
add
,
that
I
owed
*NL*
the
knowledge
of
it
to
herself
.
I
joined
them
unexpectedly
a
day
or
two
*NL*
before
the
intended
elopement
,
and
then
Georgiana
,
unable
to
support
the
*NL*
idea
of
grieving
and
offending
a
brother
whom
she
almost
looked
up
to
as
*NL*
a
father
,
acknowledged
the
whole
to
me
.
You
may
imagine
what
I
felt
and
*NL*
how
I
acted
.
Regard
for
my
sister
's
credit
and
feelings
prevented
*NL*
any
public
exposure
;
but
I
wrote
to
Mr.
Wickham
,
who
left
the
place
*NL*
immediately
,
and
Mrs.
Younge
was
of
course
removed
from
her
charge
.
Mr.
*NL*
Wickham
's
chief
object
was
unquestionably
my
sister
's
fortune
,
which
*NL*
is
thirty
thousand
pounds
;
but
I
can
not
help
supposing
that
the
hope
of
*NL*
revenging
himself
on
me
was
a
strong
inducement
.
His
revenge
would
have
*NL*
been
complete
indeed
.

This

if
you
do
not
absolutely
reject
it
as
*NL*
false
,
you
will
,
I
hope
,
acquit
me
henceforth
of
cruelty
towards
Mr.
*NL*
Wickham

I
know
not
in
what
manner
,
under
what
form
of
falsehood
he
*NL*
had
imposed
on

but
his
success
is
not
perhaps
to
be
wondered
*NL*
at

Ignorant
as
you
previously
were
of
everything

For
the
truth

everything
here
related

I
can
appeal
more

particularly
to
the
testimony
of
Colonel

from

near

still
more

the
executors
of
my

has
been
unavoidably
acquainted

particular
of

If

should
make

assertions
valueless

you
can
not

the
possibility

consulting

shall
endeavour
to
find
some
*NL*
opportunity
of
putting
this
letter
in

did

contain
a
renewal

defined
.
With
amazement
did
*NL*
she
first
understand
that
he
believed
any
apology
to
be
in
his
power
;
*NL*
and
steadfastly
was
she
persuaded
,
that
he
could
have
no
explanation
*NL*
to
give
,
which
a
just
sense
of
shame
would
not
conceal
.
With
a
strong
*NL*
prejudice
against
everything
he
might
say
,
she
began
his
account
of
what
*NL*
had
happened
at
Netherfield
.
She
read
with
an
eagerness
which
hardly
*NL*
left
her
power
of
comprehension
,
and
from
impatience
of
knowing
what
the
*NL*
next
sentence
might
bring
,
was
incapable
of
attending
to
the
sense
of
*NL*
the
one
before
her
eyes
.
His
belief
of
her
sister
's
insensibility
she
*NL*
instantly
resolved
to
be
false
;
and
his
account
of
the
real
,
the
worst
*NL*
objections
to
the
match
,
made
her
too
angry
to
have
any
wish
of
doing
*NL*
him
justice
.
He
expressed
no
regret
for
what
he
had
done
which
satisfied
*NL*
her
;
his
style
was
not
penitent
,
but
haughty
.
It
was
all
pride
and
*NL*
insolence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
this
subject
was
succeeded
by
his
account
of
Mr.
Wickham
--
when
*NL*
she
read
with
somewhat
clearer
attention
a
relation
of
events
which
,
*NL*
if
true
,
must
overthrow
every
cherished
opinion
of
his
worth
,
and
which
*NL*
bore
so
alarming
an
affinity
to
his
own
history
of
himself
--
her
*NL*
feelings
were
yet
more
acutely
painful
and
more
difficult
of
definition
.
*NL*
Astonishment
,
apprehension
,
and
even
horror
,
oppressed
her
.
She
wished
*NL*
to
discredit
it
entirely
,
repeatedly
exclaiming
,
``
This
must
be
false
!
*NL*
This
can
not
be
!
This
must
be
the
grossest
falsehood
!
''
--
and
when
she
had
*NL*
gone
through
the
whole
letter
,
though
scarcely
knowing
anything
of
the
*NL*
last
page
or
two
,
put
it
hastily
away
,
protesting
that
she
would
not
*NL*
regard
it
,
that
she
would
never
look
in
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
perturbed
state
of
mind
,
with
thoughts
that
could
rest
on
*NL*
nothing
,
she
walked
on
;
but
it
would
not
do
;
in
half
a
minute
the
letter
*NL*
was
unfolded
again
,
and
collecting
herself
as
well
as
she
could
,
she
*NL*
again
began
the
mortifying
perusal
of
all
that
related
to
Wickham
,
and
*NL*
commanded
herself
so
far
as
to
examine
the
meaning
of
every
sentence
.
*NL*
The
account
of
his
connection
with
the
Pemberley
family
was
exactly
what
*NL*
he
had
related
himself
;
and
the
kindness
of
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
,
though
*NL*
she
had
not
before
known
its
extent
,
agreed
equally
well
with
his
own
*NL*
words
.
So
far
each
recital
confirmed
the
other
;
but
when
she
came
to
the
*NL*
will
,
the
difference
was
great
.
What
Wickham
had
said
of
the
living
*NL*
was
fresh
in
her
memory
,
and
as
she
recalled
his
very
words
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
not
to
feel
that
there
was
gross
duplicity
on
one
side
or
the
*NL*
other
;
and
,
for
a
few
moments
,
she
flattered
herself
that
her
wishes
did
*NL*
not
err
.
But
when
she
read
and
re-read
with
the
closest
attention
,
the
*NL*
particulars
immediately
following
of
Wickham
's
resigning
all
pretensions
*NL*
to
the
living
,
of
his
receiving
in
lieu
so
considerable
a
sum
as
three
*NL*
thousand
pounds
,
again
was
she
forced
to
hesitate
.
She
put
down
*NL*
the
letter
,
weighed
every
circumstance
with
what
she
meant
to
be
*NL*
impartiality
--
deliberated
on
the
probability
of
each
statement
--
but
with
*NL*
little
success
.
On
both
sides
it
was
only
assertion
.
Again
she
read
*NL*
on
;
but
every
line
proved
more
clearly
that
the
affair
,
which
she
had
*NL*
believed
it
impossible
that
any
contrivance
could
so
represent
as
to
*NL*
render
Mr.
Darcy
's
conduct
in
it
less
than
infamous
,
was
capable
of
a
*NL*
turn
which
must
make
him
entirely
blameless
throughout
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
extravagance
and
general
profligacy
which
he
scrupled
not
to
lay
at
*NL*
Mr.
Wickham
's
charge
,
exceedingly
shocked
her
;
the
more
so
,
as
she
could
*NL*
bring
no
proof
of
its
injustice
.
She
had
never
heard
of
him
before
his
*NL*
entrance
into
the
--
shire
Militia
,
in
which
he
had
engaged
at
the
*NL*
persuasion
of
the
young
man
who
,
on
meeting
him
accidentally
in
town
,
*NL*
had
there
renewed
a
slight
acquaintance
.
Of
his
former
way
of
life
*NL*
nothing
had
been
known
in
Hertfordshire
but
what
he
told
himself
.
As
*NL*
to
his
real
character
,
had
information
been
in
her
power
,
she
had
*NL*
never
felt
a
wish
of
inquiring
.
His
countenance
,
voice
,
and
manner
had
*NL*
established
him
at
once
in
the
possession
of
every
virtue
.
She
tried
*NL*
to
recollect
some
instance
of
goodness
,
some
distinguished
trait
of
*NL*
integrity
or
benevolence
,
that
might
rescue
him
from
the
attacks
of
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
;
or
at
least
,
by
the
predominance
of
virtue
,
atone
for
those
*NL*
casual
errors
under
which
she
would
endeavour
to
class
what
Mr.
Darcy
*NL*
had
described
as
the
idleness
and
vice
of
many
years
'
continuance
.
But
*NL*
no
such
recollection
befriended
her
.
She
could
see
him
instantly
before
*NL*
her
,
in
every
charm
of
air
and
address
;
but
she
could
remember
no
more
*NL*
substantial
good
than
the
general
approbation
of
the
neighbourhood
,
and
*NL*
the
regard
which
his
social
powers
had
gained
him
in
the
mess
.
After
*NL*
pausing
on
this
point
a
considerable
while
,
she
once
more
continued
to
*NL*
read
.
But
,
alas
!
the
story
which
followed
,
of
his
designs
on
Miss
*NL*
Darcy
,
received
some
confirmation
from
what
had
passed
between
Colonel
*NL*
Fitzwilliam
and
herself
only
the
morning
before
;
and
at
last
she
was
*NL*
referred
for
the
truth
of
every
particular
to
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
*NL*
himself
--
from
whom
she
had
previously
received
the
information
of
his
*NL*
near
concern
in
all
his
cousin
's
affairs
,
and
whose
character
she
had
no
*NL*
reason
to
question
.
At
one
time
she
had
almost
resolved
on
applying
to
*NL*
him
,
but
the
idea
was
checked
by
the
awkwardness
of
the
application
,
and
*NL*
at
length
wholly
banished
by
the
conviction
that
Mr.
Darcy
would
never
*NL*
have
hazarded
such
a
proposal
,
if
he
had
not
been
well
assured
of
his
*NL*
cousin
's
corroboration
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
perfectly
remembered
everything
that
had
passed
in
conversation
*NL*
between
Wickham
and
herself
,
in
their
first
evening
at
Mr.
Phillips
's
.
*NL*
Many
of
his
expressions
were
still
fresh
in
her
memory
.
She
was
_
now
_
*NL*
struck
with
the
impropriety
of
such
communications
to
a
stranger
,
and
*NL*
wondered
it
had
escaped
her
before
.
She
saw
the
indelicacy
of
putting
*NL*
himself
forward
as
he
had
done
,
and
the
inconsistency
of
his
professions
*NL*
with
his
conduct
.
She
remembered
that
he
had
boasted
of
having
no
fear
*NL*
of
seeing
Mr.
Darcy
--
that
Mr.
Darcy
might
leave
the
country
,
but
that
*NL*
_
he
_
should
stand
his
ground
;
yet
he
had
avoided
the
Netherfield
ball
*NL*
the
very
next
week
.
She
remembered
also
that
,
till
the
Netherfield
*NL*
family
had
quitted
the
country
,
he
had
told
his
story
to
no
one
but
*NL*
herself
;
but
that
after
their
removal
it
had
been
everywhere
discussed
;
*NL*
that
he
had
then
no
reserves
,
no
scruples
in
sinking
Mr.
Darcy
's
*NL*
character
,
though
he
had
assured
her
that
respect
for
the
father
would
*NL*
always
prevent
his
exposing
the
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
differently
did
everything
now
appear
in
which
he
was
concerned
!
*NL*
His
attentions
to
Miss
King
were
now
the
consequence
of
views
solely
and
*NL*
hatefully
mercenary
;
and
the
mediocrity
of
her
fortune
proved
no
longer
*NL*
the
moderation
of
his
wishes
,
but
his
eagerness
to
grasp
at
anything
.
*NL*
His
behaviour
to
herself
could
now
have
had
no
tolerable
motive
;
he
had
*NL*
either
been
deceived
with
regard
to
her
fortune
,
or
had
been
gratifying
*NL*
his
vanity
by
encouraging
the
preference
which
she
believed
she
had
most
*NL*
incautiously
shown
.
Every
lingering
struggle
in
his
favour
grew
fainter
*NL*
and
fainter
;
and
in
farther
justification
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
she
could
not
*NL*
but
allow
that
Mr.
Bingley
,
when
questioned
by
Jane
,
had
long
ago
*NL*
asserted
his
blamelessness
in
the
affair
;
that
proud
and
repulsive
as
*NL*
were
his
manners
,
she
had
never
,
in
the
whole
course
of
their
*NL*
acquaintance
--
an
acquaintance
which
had
latterly
brought
them
much
*NL*
together
,
and
given
her
a
sort
of
intimacy
with
his
ways
--
seen
anything
*NL*
that
betrayed
him
to
be
unprincipled
or
unjust
--
anything
that
spoke
him
*NL*
of
irreligious
or
immoral
habits
;
that
among
his
own
connections
he
was
*NL*
esteemed
and
valued
--
that
even
Wickham
had
allowed
him
merit
as
a
*NL*
brother
,
and
that
she
had
often
heard
him
speak
so
affectionately
of
his
*NL*
sister
as
to
prove
him
capable
of
_
some
_
amiable
feeling
;
that
had
his
*NL*
actions
been
what
Mr.
Wickham
represented
them
,
so
gross
a
violation
of
*NL*
everything
right
could
hardly
have
been
concealed
from
the
world
;
and
*NL*
that
friendship
between
a
person
capable
of
it
,
and
such
an
amiable
man
*NL*
as
Mr.
Bingley
,
was
incomprehensible
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
grew
absolutely
ashamed
of
herself
.
Of
neither
Darcy
nor
Wickham
*NL*
could
she
think
without
feeling
she
had
been
blind
,
partial
,
prejudiced
,
*NL*
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
despicably
I
have
acted
!
''
she
cried
;
``
I
,
who
have
prided
myself
*NL*
on
my
discernment
!
I
,
who
have
valued
myself
on
my
abilities
!
who
have
*NL*
often
disdained
the
generous
candour
of
my
sister
,
and
gratified
*NL*
my
vanity
in
useless
or
blameable
mistrust
!
How
humiliating
is
this
*NL*
discovery
!
Yet
,
how
just
a
humiliation
!
Had
I
been
in
love
,
I
could
*NL*
not
have
been
more
wretchedly
blind
!
But
vanity
,
not
love
,
has
been
my
*NL*
folly
.
Pleased
with
the
preference
of
one
,
and
offended
by
the
neglect
*NL*
of
the
other
,
on
the
very
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
,
I
have
courted
*NL*
prepossession
and
ignorance
,
and
driven
reason
away
,
where
either
were
*NL*
concerned
.
Till
this
moment
I
never
knew
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
herself
to
Jane
--
from
Jane
to
Bingley
,
her
thoughts
were
in
a
line
*NL*
which
soon
brought
to
her
recollection
that
Mr.
Darcy
's
explanation
*NL*
_
there
_
had
appeared
very
insufficient
,
and
she
read
it
again
.
Widely
*NL*
different
was
the
effect
of
a
second
perusal
.
How
could
she
deny
that
*NL*
credit
to
his
assertions
in
one
instance
,
which
she
had
been
obliged
to
*NL*
give
in
the
other
?
He
declared
himself
to
be
totally
unsuspicious
of
her
*NL*
sister
's
attachment
;
and
she
could
not
help
remembering
what
Charlotte
's
*NL*
opinion
had
always
been
.
Neither
could
she
deny
the
justice
of
his
*NL*
description
of
Jane
.
She
felt
that
Jane
's
feelings
,
though
fervent
,
were
*NL*
little
displayed
,
and
that
there
was
a
constant
complacency
in
her
air
*NL*
and
manner
not
often
united
with
great
sensibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
came
to
that
part
of
the
letter
in
which
her
family
were
*NL*
mentioned
in
terms
of
such
mortifying
,
yet
merited
reproach
,
her
sense
*NL*
of
shame
was
severe
.
The
justice
of
the
charge
struck
her
too
forcibly
*NL*
for
denial
,
and
the
circumstances
to
which
he
particularly
alluded
as
*NL*
having
passed
at
the
Netherfield
ball
,
and
as
confirming
all
his
first
*NL*
disapprobation
,
could
not
have
made
a
stronger
impression
on
his
mind
*NL*
than
on
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
compliment
to
herself
and
her
sister
was
not
unfelt
.
It
soothed
,
*NL*
but
it
could
not
console
her
for
the
contempt
which
had
thus
been
*NL*
self-attracted
by
the
rest
of
her
family
;
and
as
she
considered
*NL*
that
Jane
's
disappointment
had
in
fact
been
the
work
of
her
nearest
*NL*
relations
,
and
reflected
how
materially
the
credit
of
both
must
be
hurt
*NL*
by
such
impropriety
of
conduct
,
she
felt
depressed
beyond
anything
she
*NL*
had
ever
known
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
wandering
along
the
lane
for
two
hours
,
giving
way
to
every
*NL*
variety
of
thought
--
re-considering
events
,
determining
probabilities
,
*NL*
and
reconciling
herself
,
as
well
as
she
could
,
to
a
change
so
sudden
and
*NL*
so
important
,
fatigue
,
and
a
recollection
of
her
long
absence
,
made
*NL*
her
at
length
return
home
;
and
she
entered
the
house
with
the
wish
*NL*
of
appearing
cheerful
as
usual
,
and
the
resolution
of
repressing
such
*NL*
reflections
as
must
make
her
unfit
for
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
immediately
told
that
the
two
gentlemen
from
Rosings
had
each
*NL*
called
during
her
absence
;
Mr.
Darcy
,
only
for
a
few
minutes
,
to
take
*NL*
leave
--
but
that
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
had
been
sitting
with
them
at
least
*NL*
an
hour
,
hoping
for
her
return
,
and
almost
resolving
to
walk
after
her
*NL*
till
she
could
be
found
.
Elizabeth
could
but
just
_
affect
_
concern
*NL*
in
missing
him
;
she
really
rejoiced
at
it
.
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
was
no
*NL*
longer
an
object
;
she
could
think
only
of
her
letter
.

Chapter
37
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
gentlemen
left
Rosings
the
next
morning
,
and
Mr.
Collins
having
*NL*
been
in
waiting
near
the
lodges
,
to
make
them
his
parting
obeisance
,
was
*NL*
able
to
bring
home
the
pleasing
intelligence
,
of
their
appearing
in
very
*NL*
good
health
,
and
in
as
tolerable
spirits
as
could
be
expected
,
after
the
*NL*
melancholy
scene
so
lately
gone
through
at
Rosings
.
To
Rosings
he
then
*NL*
hastened
,
to
console
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter
;
and
on
his
return
*NL*
brought
back
,
with
great
satisfaction
,
a
message
from
her
ladyship
,
*NL*
importing
that
she
felt
herself
so
dull
as
to
make
her
very
desirous
of
*NL*
having
them
all
to
dine
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
not
see
Lady
Catherine
without
recollecting
that
,
had
*NL*
she
chosen
it
,
she
might
by
this
time
have
been
presented
to
her
as
*NL*
her
future
niece
;
nor
could
she
think
,
without
a
smile
,
of
what
her
*NL*
ladyship
's
indignation
would
have
been
.
``
What
would
she
have
said
?
how
*NL*
would
she
have
behaved
?
''
were
questions
with
which
she
amused
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
first
subject
was
the
diminution
of
the
Rosings
party
.
``
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
I
feel
it
exceedingly
,
''
said
Lady
Catherine
;
``
I
believe
no
one
*NL*
feels
the
loss
of
friends
so
much
as
I
do
.
But
I
am
particularly
*NL*
attached
to
these
young
men
,
and
know
them
to
be
so
much
attached
to
*NL*
me
!
They
were
excessively
sorry
to
go
!
But
so
they
always
are
.
The
*NL*
dear
Colonel
rallied
his
spirits
tolerably
till
just
at
last
;
but
Darcy
*NL*
seemed
to
feel
it
most
acutely
,
more
,
I
think
,
than
last
year
.
His
*NL*
attachment
to
Rosings
certainly
increases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
had
a
compliment
,
and
an
allusion
to
throw
in
here
,
which
*NL*
were
kindly
smiled
on
by
the
mother
and
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Catherine
observed
,
after
dinner
,
that
Miss
Bennet
seemed
out
of
*NL*
spirits
,
and
immediately
accounting
for
it
by
herself
,
by
supposing
that
*NL*
she
did
not
like
to
go
home
again
so
soon
,
she
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
that
is
the
case
,
you
must
write
to
your
mother
and
beg
that
*NL*
you
may
stay
a
little
longer
.
Mrs.
Collins
will
be
very
glad
of
your
*NL*
company
,
I
am
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
your
ladyship
for
your
kind
invitation
,
''
replied
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
``
but
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
accept
it
.
I
must
be
in
town
*NL*
next
Saturday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
at
that
rate
,
you
will
have
been
here
only
six
weeks
.
I
expected
*NL*
you
to
stay
two
months
.
I
told
Mrs.
Collins
so
before
you
came
.
There
*NL*
can
be
no
occasion
for
your
going
so
soon
.
Mrs.
Bennet
could
certainly
*NL*
spare
you
for
another
fortnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
father
can
not
.
He
wrote
last
week
to
hurry
my
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
your
father
of
course
may
spare
you
,
if
your
mother
can
.
Daughters
*NL*
are
never
of
so
much
consequence
to
a
father
.
And
if
you
will
stay
*NL*
another
_
month
_
complete
,
it
will
be
in
my
power
to
take
one
of
you
as
*NL*
far
as
London
,
for
I
am
going
there
early
in
June
,
for
a
week
;
and
as
*NL*
Dawson
does
not
object
to
the
barouche-box
,
there
will
be
very
good
room
*NL*
for
one
of
you
--
and
indeed
,
if
the
weather
should
happen
to
be
cool
,
I
*NL*
should
not
object
to
taking
you
both
,
as
you
are
neither
of
you
large
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
all
kindness
,
madam
;
but
I
believe
we
must
abide
by
our
*NL*
original
plan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Catherine
seemed
resigned
.
``
Mrs.
Collins
,
you
must
send
a
servant
*NL*
with
them
.
You
know
I
always
speak
my
mind
,
and
I
can
not
bear
the
idea
*NL*
of
two
young
women
travelling
post
by
themselves
.
It
is
highly
improper
.
*NL*
You
must
contrive
to
send
somebody
.
I
have
the
greatest
dislike
in
*NL*
the
world
to
that
sort
of
thing
.
Young
women
should
always
be
properly
*NL*
guarded
and
attended
,
according
to
their
situation
in
life
.
When
my
*NL*
niece
Georgiana
went
to
Ramsgate
last
summer
,
I
made
a
point
of
her
*NL*
having
two
men-servants
go
with
her
.
Miss
Darcy
,
the
daughter
of
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
,
of
Pemberley
,
and
Lady
Anne
,
could
not
have
appeared
with
*NL*
propriety
in
a
different
manner
.
I
am
excessively
attentive
to
all
those
*NL*
things
.
You
must
send
John
with
the
young
ladies
,
Mrs.
Collins
.
I
*NL*
am
glad
it
occurred
to
me
to
mention
it
;
for
it
would
really
be
*NL*
discreditable
to
_
you
_
to
let
them
go
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
uncle
is
to
send
a
servant
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Your
uncle
!
He
keeps
a
man-servant
,
does
he
?
I
am
very
glad
you
*NL*
have
somebody
who
thinks
of
these
things
.
Where
shall
you
change
horses
?
*NL*
Oh
!
Bromley
,
of
course
.
If
you
mention
my
name
at
the
Bell
,
you
will
be
*NL*
attended
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Catherine
had
many
other
questions
to
ask
respecting
their
journey
,
*NL*
and
as
she
did
not
answer
them
all
herself
,
attention
was
necessary
,
*NL*
which
Elizabeth
believed
to
be
lucky
for
her
;
or
,
with
a
mind
so
*NL*
occupied
,
she
might
have
forgotten
where
she
was
.
Reflection
must
be
*NL*
reserved
for
solitary
hours
;
whenever
she
was
alone
,
she
gave
way
to
it
*NL*
as
the
greatest
relief
;
and
not
a
day
went
by
without
a
solitary
*NL*
walk
,
in
which
she
might
indulge
in
all
the
delight
of
unpleasant
*NL*
recollections
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
's
letter
she
was
in
a
fair
way
of
soon
knowing
by
heart
.
She
*NL*
studied
every
sentence
;
and
her
feelings
towards
its
writer
were
at
*NL*
times
widely
different
.
When
she
remembered
the
style
of
his
address
,
*NL*
she
was
still
full
of
indignation
;
but
when
she
considered
how
unjustly
*NL*
she
had
condemned
and
upbraided
him
,
her
anger
was
turned
against
*NL*
herself
;
and
his
disappointed
feelings
became
the
object
of
compassion
.
*NL*
His
attachment
excited
gratitude
,
his
general
character
respect
;
but
she
*NL*
could
not
approve
him
;
nor
could
she
for
a
moment
repent
her
refusal
,
*NL*
or
feel
the
slightest
inclination
ever
to
see
him
again
.
In
her
own
past
*NL*
behaviour
,
there
was
a
constant
source
of
vexation
and
regret
;
and
in
*NL*
the
unhappy
defects
of
her
family
,
a
subject
of
yet
heavier
chagrin
.
*NL*
They
were
hopeless
of
remedy
.
Her
father
,
contented
with
laughing
at
*NL*
them
,
would
never
exert
himself
to
restrain
the
wild
giddiness
of
his
*NL*
youngest
daughters
;
and
her
mother
,
with
manners
so
far
from
right
*NL*
herself
,
was
entirely
insensible
of
the
evil
.
Elizabeth
had
frequently
*NL*
united
with
Jane
in
an
endeavour
to
check
the
imprudence
of
Catherine
*NL*
and
Lydia
;
but
while
they
were
supported
by
their
mother
's
indulgence
,
*NL*
what
chance
could
there
be
of
improvement
?
Catherine
,
weak-spirited
,
*NL*
irritable
,
and
completely
under
Lydia
's
guidance
,
had
been
always
*NL*
affronted
by
their
advice
;
and
Lydia
,
self-willed
and
careless
,
would
*NL*
scarcely
give
them
a
hearing
.
They
were
ignorant
,
idle
,
and
vain
.
While
*NL*
there
was
an
officer
in
Meryton
,
they
would
flirt
with
him
;
and
while
*NL*
Meryton
was
within
a
walk
of
Longbourn
,
they
would
be
going
there
*NL*
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anxiety
on
Jane
's
behalf
was
another
prevailing
concern
;
and
Mr.
Darcy
's
*NL*
explanation
,
by
restoring
Bingley
to
all
her
former
good
opinion
,
*NL*
heightened
the
sense
of
what
Jane
had
lost
.
His
affection
was
proved
*NL*
to
have
been
sincere
,
and
his
conduct
cleared
of
all
blame
,
unless
any
*NL*
could
attach
to
the
implicitness
of
his
confidence
in
his
friend
.
How
*NL*
grievous
then
was
the
thought
that
,
of
a
situation
so
desirable
in
every
*NL*
respect
,
so
replete
with
advantage
,
so
promising
for
happiness
,
Jane
had
*NL*
been
deprived
,
by
the
folly
and
indecorum
of
her
own
family
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
to
these
recollections
was
added
the
development
of
Wickham
's
*NL*
character
,
it
may
be
easily
believed
that
the
happy
spirits
which
had
*NL*
seldom
been
depressed
before
,
were
now
so
much
affected
as
to
make
it
*NL*
almost
impossible
for
her
to
appear
tolerably
cheerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
engagements
at
Rosings
were
as
frequent
during
the
last
week
of
*NL*
her
stay
as
they
had
been
at
first
.
The
very
last
evening
was
spent
*NL*
there
;
and
her
ladyship
again
inquired
minutely
into
the
particulars
of
*NL*
their
journey
,
gave
them
directions
as
to
the
best
method
of
packing
,
*NL*
and
was
so
urgent
on
the
necessity
of
placing
gowns
in
the
only
right
*NL*
way
,
that
Maria
thought
herself
obliged
,
on
her
return
,
to
undo
all
the
*NL*
work
of
the
morning
,
and
pack
her
trunk
afresh
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
parted
,
Lady
Catherine
,
with
great
condescension
,
wished
them
*NL*
a
good
journey
,
and
invited
them
to
come
to
Hunsford
again
next
year
;
*NL*
and
Miss
de
Bourgh
exerted
herself
so
far
as
to
curtsey
and
hold
out
her
*NL*
hand
to
both
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
Saturday
morning
Elizabeth
and
Mr.
Collins
met
for
breakfast
a
few
*NL*
minutes
before
the
others
appeared
;
and
he
took
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
paying
the
parting
civilities
which
he
deemed
indispensably
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
,
Miss
Elizabeth
,
''
said
he
,
``
whether
Mrs.
Collins
has
yet
*NL*
expressed
her
sense
of
your
kindness
in
coming
to
us
;
but
I
am
very
*NL*
certain
you
will
not
leave
the
house
without
receiving
her
thanks
for
*NL*
it
.
The
favour
of
your
company
has
been
much
felt
,
I
assure
you
.
We
*NL*
know
how
little
there
is
to
tempt
anyone
to
our
humble
abode
.
Our
plain
*NL*
manner
of
living
,
our
small
rooms
and
few
domestics
,
and
the
little
we
*NL*
see
of
the
world
,
must
make
Hunsford
extremely
dull
to
a
young
lady
like
*NL*
yourself
;
but
I
hope
you
will
believe
us
grateful
for
the
condescension
,
*NL*
and
that
we
have
done
everything
in
our
power
to
prevent
your
spending
*NL*
your
time
unpleasantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
eager
with
her
thanks
and
assurances
of
happiness
.
She
*NL*
had
spent
six
weeks
with
great
enjoyment
;
and
the
pleasure
of
being
with
*NL*
Charlotte
,
and
the
kind
attentions
she
had
received
,
must
make
_
her
_
*NL*
feel
the
obliged
.
Mr.
Collins
was
gratified
,
and
with
a
more
smiling
*NL*
solemnity
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
hear
that
you
have
passed
your
time
not
*NL*
disagreeably
.
We
have
certainly
done
our
best
;
and
most
fortunately
*NL*
having
it
in
our
power
to
introduce
you
to
very
superior
society
,
and
,
*NL*
from
our
connection
with
Rosings
,
the
frequent
means
of
varying
the
*NL*
humble
home
scene
,
I
think
we
may
flatter
ourselves
that
your
Hunsford
*NL*
visit
can
not
have
been
entirely
irksome
.
Our
situation
with
regard
to
*NL*
Lady
Catherine
's
family
is
indeed
the
sort
of
extraordinary
advantage
*NL*
and
blessing
which
few
can
boast
.
You
see
on
what
a
footing
we
are
.
You
*NL*
see
how
continually
we
are
engaged
there
.
In
truth
I
must
acknowledge
*NL*
that
,
with
all
the
disadvantages
of
this
humble
parsonage
,
I
should
*NL*
not
think
anyone
abiding
in
it
an
object
of
compassion
,
while
they
are
*NL*
sharers
of
our
intimacy
at
Rosings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Words
were
insufficient
for
the
elevation
of
his
feelings
;
and
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
walk
about
the
room
,
while
Elizabeth
tried
to
unite
civility
*NL*
and
truth
in
a
few
short
sentences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
,
in
fact
,
carry
a
very
favourable
report
of
us
into
*NL*
Hertfordshire
,
my
dear
cousin
.
I
flatter
myself
at
least
that
you
will
*NL*
be
able
to
do
so
.
Lady
Catherine
's
great
attentions
to
Mrs.
Collins
you
*NL*
have
been
a
daily
witness
of
;
and
altogether
I
trust
it
does
not
appear
*NL*
that
your
friend
has
drawn
an
unfortunate
--
but
on
this
point
it
will
be
*NL*
as
well
to
be
silent
.
Only
let
me
assure
you
,
my
dear
Miss
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
that
I
can
from
my
heart
most
cordially
wish
you
equal
felicity
in
*NL*
marriage
.
My
dear
Charlotte
and
I
have
but
one
mind
and
one
way
of
*NL*
thinking
.
There
is
in
everything
a
most
remarkable
resemblance
of
*NL*
character
and
ideas
between
us
.
We
seem
to
have
been
designed
for
each
*NL*
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
safely
say
that
it
was
a
great
happiness
where
that
was
*NL*
the
case
,
and
with
equal
sincerity
could
add
,
that
she
firmly
believed
*NL*
and
rejoiced
in
his
domestic
comforts
.
She
was
not
sorry
,
however
,
to
*NL*
have
the
recital
of
them
interrupted
by
the
lady
from
whom
they
sprang
.
*NL*
Poor
Charlotte
!
it
was
melancholy
to
leave
her
to
such
society
!
But
she
*NL*
had
chosen
it
with
her
eyes
open
;
and
though
evidently
regretting
that
*NL*
her
visitors
were
to
go
,
she
did
not
seem
to
ask
for
compassion
.
Her
*NL*
home
and
her
housekeeping
,
her
parish
and
her
poultry
,
and
all
their
*NL*
dependent
concerns
,
had
not
yet
lost
their
charms
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
chaise
arrived
,
the
trunks
were
fastened
on
,
the
parcels
*NL*
placed
within
,
and
it
was
pronounced
to
be
ready
.
After
an
affectionate
*NL*
parting
between
the
friends
,
Elizabeth
was
attended
to
the
carriage
by
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
,
and
as
they
walked
down
the
garden
he
was
commissioning
her
*NL*
with
his
best
respects
to
all
her
family
,
not
forgetting
his
thanks
*NL*
for
the
kindness
he
had
received
at
Longbourn
in
the
winter
,
and
his
*NL*
compliments
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
though
unknown
.
He
then
handed
her
*NL*
in
,
Maria
followed
,
and
the
door
was
on
the
point
of
being
closed
,
*NL*
when
he
suddenly
reminded
them
,
with
some
consternation
,
that
they
had
*NL*
hitherto
forgotten
to
leave
any
message
for
the
ladies
at
Rosings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
he
added
,
``
you
will
of
course
wish
to
have
your
humble
respects
*NL*
delivered
to
them
,
with
your
grateful
thanks
for
their
kindness
to
you
*NL*
while
you
have
been
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
made
no
objection
;
the
door
was
then
allowed
to
be
shut
,
and
*NL*
the
carriage
drove
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
!
''
cried
Maria
,
after
a
few
minutes
'
silence
,
``
it
seems
*NL*
but
a
day
or
two
since
we
first
came
!
and
yet
how
many
things
have
*NL*
happened
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
many
indeed
,
''
said
her
companion
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
dined
nine
times
at
Rosings
,
besides
drinking
tea
there
twice
!
*NL*
How
much
I
shall
have
to
tell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
added
privately
,
``
And
how
much
I
shall
have
to
conceal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
journey
was
performed
without
much
conversation
,
or
any
alarm
;
and
*NL*
within
four
hours
of
their
leaving
Hunsford
they
reached
Mr.
Gardiner
's
*NL*
house
,
where
they
were
to
remain
a
few
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
looked
well
,
and
Elizabeth
had
little
opportunity
of
studying
her
*NL*
spirits
,
amidst
the
various
engagements
which
the
kindness
of
her
*NL*
aunt
had
reserved
for
them
.
But
Jane
was
to
go
home
with
her
,
and
at
*NL*
Longbourn
there
would
be
leisure
enough
for
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
without
an
effort
,
meanwhile
,
that
she
could
wait
even
for
*NL*
Longbourn
,
before
she
told
her
sister
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
proposals
.
To
know
*NL*
that
she
had
the
power
of
revealing
what
would
so
exceedingly
astonish
*NL*
Jane
,
and
must
,
at
the
same
time
,
so
highly
gratify
whatever
of
her
own
*NL*
vanity
she
had
not
yet
been
able
to
reason
away
,
was
such
a
temptation
*NL*
to
openness
as
nothing
could
have
conquered
but
the
state
of
indecision
*NL*
in
which
she
remained
as
to
the
extent
of
what
she
should
communicate
;
*NL*
and
her
fear
,
if
she
once
entered
on
the
subject
,
of
being
hurried
*NL*
into
repeating
something
of
Bingley
which
might
only
grieve
her
sister
*NL*
further
.

Chapter

*NL*
It
was
the
second
week
in
May
,
in
which
the
three
young
ladies
set
out
*NL*
together
from
Gracechurch
Street
for
the
town
of
--
,
in
Hertfordshire
;
*NL*
and
,
as
they
drew
near
the
appointed
inn
where
Mr.
Bennet
's
carriage
*NL*
was
to
meet
them
,
they
quickly
perceived
,
in
token
of
the
coachman
's
*NL*
punctuality
,
both
Kitty
and
Lydia
looking
out
of
a
dining-room
up
stairs
.
*NL*
These
two
girls
had
been
above
an
hour
in
the
place
,
happily
employed
*NL*
in
visiting
an
opposite
milliner
,
watching
the
sentinel
on
guard
,
and
*NL*
dressing
a
salad
and
cucumber
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
welcoming
their
sisters
,
they
triumphantly
displayed
a
table
set
*NL*
out
with
such
cold
meat
as
an
inn
larder
usually
affords
,
exclaiming
,
*NL*
``
Is
not
this
nice
?
Is
not
this
an
agreeable
surprise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
we
mean
to
treat
you
all
,
''
added
Lydia
,
``
but
you
must
lend
us
the
*NL*
money
,
for
we
have
just
spent
ours
at
the
shop
out
there
.
''
Then
,
showing
*NL*
her
purchases
--
``
Look
here
,
I
have
bought
this
bonnet
.
I
do
not
think
*NL*
it
is
very
pretty
;
but
I
thought
I
might
as
well
buy
it
as
not
.
I
shall
*NL*
pull
it
to
pieces
as
soon
as
I
get
home
,
and
see
if
I
can
make
it
up
any
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
her
sisters
abused
it
as
ugly
,
she
added
,
with
perfect
*NL*
unconcern
,
``
Oh
!
but
there
were
two
or
three
much
uglier
in
the
shop
;
and
*NL*
when
I
have
bought
some
prettier-coloured
satin
to
trim
it
with
fresh
,
I
*NL*
think
it
will
be
very
tolerable
.
Besides
,
it
will
not
much
signify
what
*NL*
one
wears
this
summer
,
after
the
--
shire
have
left
Meryton
,
and
they
*NL*
are
going
in
a
fortnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
indeed
!
''
cried
Elizabeth
,
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
going
to
be
encamped
near
Brighton
;
and
I
do
so
want
papa
to
*NL*
take
us
all
there
for
the
summer
!
It
would
be
such
a
delicious
scheme
;
*NL*
and
I
dare
say
would
hardly
cost
anything
at
all
.
Mamma
would
like
to
*NL*
go
too
of
all
things
!
Only
think
what
a
miserable
summer
else
we
shall
*NL*
have
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
thought
Elizabeth
,
''
_
that
_
would
be
a
delightful
scheme
indeed
,
*NL*
and
completely
do
for
us
at
once
.
Good
Heaven
!
Brighton
,
and
a
whole
*NL*
campful
of
soldiers
,
to
us
,
who
have
been
overset
already
by
one
poor
*NL*
regiment
of
militia
,
and
the
monthly
balls
of
Meryton
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
have
got
some
news
for
you
,
''
said
Lydia
,
as
they
sat
down
at
*NL*
table
.
``
What
do
you
think
?
It
is
excellent
news
--
capital
news
--
and
about
*NL*
a
certain
person
we
all
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
and
Elizabeth
looked
at
each
other
,
and
the
waiter
was
told
he
need
*NL*
not
stay
.
Lydia
laughed
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
that
is
just
like
your
formality
and
discretion
.
You
thought
the
*NL*
waiter
must
not
hear
,
as
if
he
cared
!
I
dare
say
he
often
hears
worse
*NL*
things
said
than
I
am
going
to
say
.
But
he
is
an
ugly
fellow
!
I
am
glad
*NL*
he
is
gone
.
I
never
saw
such
a
long
chin
in
my
life
.
Well
,
but
now
for
*NL*
my
news
;
it
is
about
dear
Wickham
;
too
good
for
the
waiter
,
is
it
not
?
*NL*
There
is
no
danger
of
Wickham
's
marrying
Mary
King
.
There
's
for
you
!
She
*NL*
is
gone
down
to
her
uncle
at
Liverpool
:
gone
to
stay
.
Wickham
is
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mary
King
is
safe
!
''
added
Elizabeth
;
``
safe
from
a
connection
*NL*
imprudent
as
to
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
great
fool
for
going
away
,
if
she
liked
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
hope
there
is
no
strong
attachment
on
either
side
,
''
said
Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
there
is
not
on
_
his
_
.
I
will
answer
for
it
,
he
never
cared
*NL*
three
straws
about
her
--
who
could
about
such
a
nasty
little
freckled
*NL*
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
shocked
to
think
that
,
however
incapable
of
such
*NL*
coarseness
of
_
expression
_
herself
,
the
coarseness
of
the
_
sentiment
_
*NL*
was
little
other
than
her
own
breast
had
harboured
and
fancied
liberal
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
all
had
ate
,
and
the
elder
ones
paid
,
the
carriage
was
*NL*
ordered
;
and
after
some
contrivance
,
the
whole
party
,
with
all
their
*NL*
boxes
,
work-bags
,
and
parcels
,
and
the
unwelcome
addition
of
Kitty
's
and
*NL*
Lydia
's
purchases
,
were
seated
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
nicely
we
are
all
crammed
in
,
''
cried
Lydia
.
``
I
am
glad
I
bought
my
*NL*
bonnet
,
if
it
is
only
for
the
fun
of
having
another
bandbox
!
Well
,
now
*NL*
let
us
be
quite
comfortable
and
snug
,
and
talk
and
laugh
all
the
way
*NL*
home
.
And
in
the
first
place
,
let
us
hear
what
has
happened
to
you
all
*NL*
since
you
went
away
.
Have
you
seen
any
pleasant
men
?
Have
you
had
any
*NL*
flirting
?
I
was
in
great
hopes
that
one
of
you
would
have
got
a
husband
*NL*
before
you
came
back
.
Jane
will
be
quite
an
old
maid
soon
,
I
declare
.
*NL*
She
is
almost
three-and-twenty
!
Lord
,
how
ashamed
I
should
be
of
not
*NL*
being
married
before
three-and-twenty
!
My
aunt
Phillips
wants
you
so
to
*NL*
get
husbands
,
you
ca
n't
think
.
She
says
Lizzy
had
better
have
taken
Mr.
*NL*
Collins
;
but
_
I
_
do
not
think
there
would
have
been
any
fun
in
it
.
Lord
!
*NL*
how
I
should
like
to
be
married
before
any
of
you
;
and
then
I
would
*NL*
chaperon
you
about
to
all
the
balls
.
Dear
me
!
we
had
such
a
good
piece
*NL*
of
fun
the
other
day
at
Colonel
Forster
's
.
Kitty
and
me
were
to
spend
*NL*
the
day
there
,
and
Mrs.
Forster
promised
to
have
a
little
dance
in
the
*NL*
evening
;
-LRB-
by
the
bye
,
Mrs.
Forster
and
me
are
_
such
_
friends
!
-RRB-
and
so
*NL*
she
asked
the
two
Harringtons
to
come
,
but
Harriet
was
ill
,
and
so
Pen
*NL*
was
forced
to
come
by
herself
;
and
then
,
what
do
you
think
we
did
?
We
*NL*
dressed
up
Chamberlayne
in
woman
's
clothes
on
purpose
to
pass
for
a
*NL*
lady
,
only
think
what
fun
!
Not
a
soul
knew
of
it
,
but
Colonel
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Forster
,
and
Kitty
and
me
,
except
my
aunt
,
for
we
were
forced
to
borrow
*NL*
one
of
her
gowns
;
and
you
can
not
imagine
how
well
he
looked
!
When
Denny
,
*NL*
and
Wickham
,
and
Pratt
,
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
men
came
in
,
they
*NL*
did
not
know
him
in
the
least
.
Lord
!
how
I
laughed
!
and
so
did
Mrs.
*NL*
Forster
.
I
thought
I
should
have
died
.
And
_
that
_
made
the
men
suspect
*NL*
something
,
and
then
they
soon
found
out
what
was
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
kinds
of
histories
of
their
parties
and
good
jokes
,
did
*NL*
Lydia
,
assisted
by
Kitty
's
hints
and
additions
,
endeavour
to
amuse
her
*NL*
companions
all
the
way
to
Longbourn
.
Elizabeth
listened
as
little
as
she
*NL*
could
,
but
there
was
no
escaping
the
frequent
mention
of
Wickham
's
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
reception
at
home
was
most
kind
.
Mrs.
Bennet
rejoiced
to
see
Jane
*NL*
in
undiminished
beauty
;
and
more
than
once
during
dinner
did
Mr.
Bennet
*NL*
say
voluntarily
to
Elizabeth
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
are
come
back
,
Lizzy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
party
in
the
dining-room
was
large
,
for
almost
all
the
Lucases
*NL*
came
to
meet
Maria
and
hear
the
news
;
and
various
were
the
subjects
that
*NL*
occupied
them
:
Lady
Lucas
was
inquiring
of
Maria
,
after
the
welfare
and
*NL*
poultry
of
her
eldest
daughter
;
Mrs.
Bennet
was
doubly
engaged
,
on
one
*NL*
hand
collecting
an
account
of
the
present
fashions
from
Jane
,
who
sat
*NL*
some
way
below
her
,
and
,
on
the
other
,
retailing
them
all
to
the
younger
*NL*
Lucases
;
and
Lydia
,
in
a
voice
rather
louder
than
any
other
person
's
,
*NL*
was
enumerating
the
various
pleasures
of
the
morning
to
anybody
who
*NL*
would
hear
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Mary
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
wish
you
had
gone
with
us
,
for
we
had
such
fun
!
*NL*
As
we
went
along
,
Kitty
and
I
drew
up
the
blinds
,
and
pretended
there
*NL*
was
nobody
in
the
coach
;
and
I
should
have
gone
so
all
the
way
,
if
Kitty
*NL*
had
not
been
sick
;
and
when
we
got
to
the
George
,
I
do
think
we
behaved
*NL*
very
handsomely
,
for
we
treated
the
other
three
with
the
nicest
cold
*NL*
luncheon
in
the
world
,
and
if
you
would
have
gone
,
we
would
have
treated
*NL*
you
too
.
And
then
when
we
came
away
it
was
such
fun
!
I
thought
we
never
*NL*
should
have
got
into
the
coach
.
I
was
ready
to
die
of
laughter
.
And
then
*NL*
we
were
so
merry
all
the
way
home
!
we
talked
and
laughed
so
loud
,
that
*NL*
anybody
might
have
heard
us
ten
miles
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Mary
very
gravely
replied
,
``
Far
be
it
from
me
,
my
dear
sister
,
*NL*
to
depreciate
such
pleasures
!
They
would
doubtless
be
congenial
with
the
*NL*
generality
of
female
minds
.
But
I
confess
they
would
have
no
charms
for
*NL*
_
me
_
--
I
should
infinitely
prefer
a
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
of
this
answer
Lydia
heard
not
a
word
.
She
seldom
listened
to
*NL*
anybody
for
more
than
half
a
minute
,
and
never
attended
to
Mary
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
Lydia
was
urgent
with
the
rest
of
the
girls
to
walk
*NL*
to
Meryton
,
and
to
see
how
everybody
went
on
;
but
Elizabeth
steadily
*NL*
opposed
the
scheme
.
It
should
not
be
said
that
the
Miss
Bennets
could
*NL*
not
be
at
home
half
a
day
before
they
were
in
pursuit
of
the
officers
.
*NL*
There
was
another
reason
too
for
her
opposition
.
She
dreaded
seeing
Mr.
*NL*
Wickham
again
,
and
was
resolved
to
avoid
it
as
long
as
possible
.
The
*NL*
comfort
to
_
her
_
of
the
regiment
's
approaching
removal
was
indeed
beyond
*NL*
expression
.
In
a
fortnight
they
were
to
go
--
and
once
gone
,
she
hoped
*NL*
there
could
be
nothing
more
to
plague
her
on
his
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
been
many
hours
at
home
before
she
found
that
the
Brighton
*NL*
scheme
,
of
which
Lydia
had
given
them
a
hint
at
the
inn
,
was
under
*NL*
frequent
discussion
between
her
parents
.
Elizabeth
saw
directly
that
her
*NL*
father
had
not
the
smallest
intention
of
yielding
;
but
his
answers
were
*NL*
at
the
same
time
so
vague
and
equivocal
,
that
her
mother
,
though
often
*NL*
disheartened
,
had
never
yet
despaired
of
succeeding
at
last
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
impatience
to
acquaint
Jane
with
what
had
happened
could
*NL*
no
longer
be
overcome
;
and
at
length
,
resolving
to
suppress
every
*NL*
particular
in
which
her
sister
was
concerned
,
and
preparing
her
to
be
*NL*
surprised
,
she
related
to
her
the
next
morning
the
chief
of
the
scene
*NL*
between
Mr.
Darcy
and
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bennet
's
astonishment
was
soon
lessened
by
the
strong
sisterly
*NL*
partiality
which
made
any
admiration
of
Elizabeth
appear
perfectly
*NL*
natural
;
and
all
surprise
was
shortly
lost
in
other
feelings
.
She
was
*NL*
sorry
that
Mr.
Darcy
should
have
delivered
his
sentiments
in
a
manner
so
*NL*
little
suited
to
recommend
them
;
but
still
more
was
she
grieved
for
the
*NL*
unhappiness
which
her
sister
's
refusal
must
have
given
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
being
so
sure
of
succeeding
was
wrong
,
''
said
she
,
``
and
certainly
*NL*
ought
not
to
have
appeared
;
but
consider
how
much
it
must
increase
his
*NL*
disappointment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
,
``
I
am
heartily
sorry
for
him
;
but
he
has
*NL*
other
feelings
,
which
will
probably
soon
drive
away
his
regard
for
me
.
*NL*
You
do
not
blame
me
,
however
,
for
refusing
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blame
you
!
Oh
,
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
blame
me
for
having
spoken
so
warmly
of
Wickham
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
do
not
know
that
you
were
wrong
in
saying
what
you
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
_
will
_
know
it
,
when
I
tell
you
what
happened
the
very
next
*NL*
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
spoke
of
the
letter
,
repeating
the
whole
of
its
contents
as
far
*NL*
as
they
concerned
George
Wickham
.
What
a
stroke
was
this
for
poor
Jane
!
*NL*
who
would
willingly
have
gone
through
the
world
without
believing
that
*NL*
so
much
wickedness
existed
in
the
whole
race
of
mankind
,
as
was
here
*NL*
collected
in
one
individual
.
Nor
was
Darcy
's
vindication
,
though
*NL*
grateful
to
her
feelings
,
capable
of
consoling
her
for
such
discovery
.
*NL*
Most
earnestly
did
she
labour
to
prove
the
probability
of
error
,
and
*NL*
seek
to
clear
the
one
without
involving
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
not
do
,
''
said
Elizabeth
;
``
you
never
will
be
able
to
make
both
*NL*
of
them
good
for
anything
.
Take
your
choice
,
but
you
must
be
satisfied
*NL*
with
only
one
.
There
is
but
such
a
quantity
of
merit
between
them
;
just
*NL*
enough
to
make
one
good
sort
of
man
;
and
of
late
it
has
been
shifting
*NL*
about
pretty
much
.
For
my
part
,
I
am
inclined
to
believe
it
all
Darcy
's
;
*NL*
but
you
shall
do
as
you
choose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
time
,
however
,
before
a
smile
could
be
extorted
from
Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
when
I
have
been
more
shocked
,
''
said
she
.
``
Wickham
so
*NL*
very
bad
!
It
is
almost
past
belief
.
And
poor
Mr.
Darcy
!
Dear
Lizzy
,
only
*NL*
consider
what
he
must
have
suffered
.
Such
a
disappointment
!
and
with
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
your
ill
opinion
,
too
!
and
having
to
relate
such
a
thing
*NL*
of
his
sister
!
It
is
really
too
distressing

I
am
sure
you
must
feel
it
*NL*
so
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
no
,
my
regret
and
compassion
are
all
done
away
by
seeing
you
so
*NL*
full
of
both

I
know
you
will
do
him
such
ample
justice
,
that
I
am
*NL*
growing
every
moment
more
unconcerned
and
indifferent
.
Your
profusion
*NL*
makes
me
saving
;
and
if
you
lament
over
him
much
longer
,
my
heart
will
*NL*
be
as
light
as
a
feather

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Wickham

there
is
such
an
expression
of
goodness
in
his
*NL*
countenance

such
an
openness

gentleness
in
his
manner
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
certainly
was
some
great
mismanagement
in
the
education
of
those
*NL*
two
young
men

One
has
got
all
the
goodness
,
and
the
other
all
the
*NL*
appearance
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
thought
Mr.

so
deficient

you

used
to
do
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
meant
to
be
uncommonly
clever
in
taking
so
decided
a

reason

It
is
such
a
spur
to
one
's
genius
,
such
an
*NL*
opening
for
wit
,
to
have
a
dislike
of
that
kind

One
may
be
continually

abusive
without
saying
anything
just
;

one
can
not
always
be
laughing
*NL*
at
a

something
witty

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizzy

unhappy

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
unfortunate
that
you
should
have
used
such
very
strong

in
speaking
of

for
now
they
_

appear
wholly

*NL*
*NL*

Certainly

But
the
misfortune

speaking
with
bitterness
is
a
most
*NL*
natural
consequence

the
prejudices
I

been
encouraging
.
There
*NL*
is
one
point
on
which
I
want
your
advice

I
want
to
be
told
whether
I

make
our

general
understand

*NL*
Miss
Bennet
paused
a
little
,
and
then
replied
,
``
Surely
there
can
be
no
*NL*
occasion
for
exposing
him
so
dreadfully
.
What
is
your
opinion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
it
ought
not
to
be
attempted

Mr.
Darcy
has
not
authorised
me
*NL*
to
make
his
communication
public
.
On
the
contrary
,
every
particular
*NL*
relative
to
his
sister
was
meant
to
be
kept
as
much
as
possible
to
*NL*
myself
;
and
if
I
endeavour
to
undeceive
people
as
to
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
conduct
,
who
will
believe
me
?
The
general
prejudice
against
Mr.

*NL*
is
so
violent
,
that
it
would
be
the
death
of
half
the
good
people
in
*NL*
Meryton
to
attempt
to
place
him
in
an
amiable
light

I
am
not
equal

to
it

Wickham
will
soon
be
gone
;
and
therefore
it
will
not
signify
to
*NL*
anyone
here
what
he
really
is

Some
time
hence
it
will
be
all
found
out
,
*NL*
and
then
we
may
laugh
at
their
stupidity
in
not
knowing
it
before

At
*NL*
present
I
will
say
nothing
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
right
.
To
have
his
errors
made
public
might
ruin
him
for
*NL*
ever
.
He
is
now
,
perhaps
,
sorry
for
what
he
has
done

anxious
to
*NL*
re-establish
a
character

We
must
not
make

desperate

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tumult
of
Elizabeth
's
mind
was
allayed
by
this
conversation
.
She
had
*NL*
got
rid
of
two
of
the
secrets
which
had
weighed
on
her
for
a
fortnight
,
*NL*
and
was
certain
of
a
willing
listener
in
Jane
,
whenever
she
might
wish
*NL*
to
talk
again
of
either
.
But
there
was
still
something
lurking
behind
,
*NL*
of
which
prudence
forbade
the
disclosure
.
She
dared
not
relate
the
other
*NL*
half
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
letter
,
nor
explain
to
her
sister
how
sincerely
she
*NL*
had
been
valued
by
her
friend
.
Here
was
knowledge
in
which
no
one
*NL*
could
partake
;
and
she
was
sensible
that
nothing
less
than
a
perfect
*NL*
understanding
between
the
parties
could
justify
her
in
throwing
off
*NL*
this
last
encumbrance
of
mystery
.
``
And
then
,
''
said
she
,
``
if
that
very
*NL*
improbable
event
should
ever
take
place
,
I
shall
merely
be
able
to
*NL*
tell
what
Bingley
may
tell
in
a
much
more
agreeable
manner
himself
.
The
*NL*
liberty
of
communication
can
not
be
mine
till
it
has
lost
all
its
value
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
now
,
on
being
settled
at
home
,
at
leisure
to
observe
the
real
*NL*
state
of
her
sister
's
spirits
.
Jane
was
not
happy
.
She
still
cherished
a
*NL*
very
tender
affection
for
Bingley
.
Having
never
even
fancied
herself
*NL*
in
love
before
,
her
regard
had
all
the
warmth
of
first
attachment
,
*NL*
and
,
from
her
age
and
disposition
,
greater
steadiness
than
most
first
*NL*
attachments
often
boast
;
and
so
fervently
did
she
value
his
remembrance
,
*NL*
and
prefer
him
to
every
other
man
,
that
all
her
good
sense
,
and
all
her
*NL*
attention
to
the
feelings
of
her
friends
,
were
requisite
to
check
the
*NL*
indulgence
of
those
regrets
which
must
have
been
injurious
to
her
own
*NL*
health
and
their
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Lizzy
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bennet
one
day
,
``
what
is
your
opinion
_
now
_
of
*NL*
this
sad
business
of
Jane
's
?
For
my
part
,
I
am
determined
never
to
speak
*NL*
of
it
again
to
anybody
.
I
told
my
sister
Phillips
so
the
other
day
.
But
*NL*
I
can
not
find
out
that
Jane
saw
anything
of
him
in
London
.
Well

he
is
*NL*
a
very
undeserving
young
man

and
I
do
not
suppose
there
's
the
least
*NL*
chance
in
the
world
of
her
ever
getting
him
now
.
There
is
no
talk
of
*NL*
his
coming
to
Netherfield
again
in
the
summer
;
and
I
have
inquired
of
*NL*
everybody
,
too
,
who
is
likely
to
know

shall
always
say
he
used
my
daughter
extremely
ill
;
and
if
I
was
her

I
*NL*
would
not
have
put
up
with
it

Well

my
comfort
is

I
am
sure
Jane
will
*NL*
die
of
a
broken
heart

and
then
he
will
be
sorry
for
what
he
has
done

*NL*
*NL*
But
as
Elizabeth
could
not
receive
comfort
from
any
such
expectation
,
*NL*
she
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

continued
her
mother

soon
afterwards
,
``

excellent

I
dare
say

If
she
is
half
as
sharp
as

mother

she
is
saving
enough

There
is
nothing
extravagant

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

nothing

*NL*

take
care

so

I
suppose

they
often
*NL*
talk

having
Longbourn
when
your
father
is
dead

They
look
upon
it

*NL*
quite
their
own

I
dare
say
,
whenever
that
happens

No

have
been
strange

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
week
of
their
return
was
soon
gone
.
The
second
began
.
It
was
*NL*
the
last
of
the
regiment
's
stay
in
Meryton
,
and
all
the
young
ladies
*NL*
in
the
neighbourhood
were
drooping
apace
.
The
dejection
was
almost
*NL*
universal
.
The
elder
Miss
Bennets
alone
were
still
able
to
eat
,
drink
,
*NL*
and
sleep
,
and
pursue
the
usual
course
of
their
employments
.
Very
*NL*
frequently
were
they
reproached
for
this
insensibility
by
Kitty
and
*NL*
Lydia
,
whose
own
misery
was
extreme
,
and
who
could
not
comprehend
such
*NL*
hard-heartedness
in
any
of
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Heaven
!
what
is
to
become
of
us
?
What
are
we
to
do
?
''
would
they
*NL*
often
exclaim
in
the
bitterness
of
woe
.
``
How
can
you
be
smiling
so
,
*NL*
Lizzy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
affectionate
mother
shared
all
their
grief
;
she
remembered
what
*NL*
she
had
herself
endured
on
a
similar
occasion
,
five-and-twenty
years
*NL*
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
cried
for
two
days
together
when
Colonel
*NL*
Miller

regiment
went
away

I
thought

broken
my
heart

``

Mrs.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*

``
A
little
sea-bathing
would
set

up

``

added
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
kind
of
lamentations
resounding
perpetually
through
*NL*
Longbourn
House
.
Elizabeth
tried
to
be
diverted
by
them
;
but
all
sense
*NL*
of
pleasure
was
lost
in
shame
.
She
felt
anew
the
justice
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
*NL*
objections
;
and
never
had
she
been
so
much
disposed
to
pardon
his
*NL*
interference
in
the
views
of
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
gloom
of
Lydia
's
prospect
was
shortly
cleared
away
;
for
she
*NL*
received
an
invitation
from
Mrs.
Forster
,
the
wife
of
the
colonel
of
*NL*
the
regiment
,
to
accompany
her
to
Brighton
.
This
invaluable
friend
was
a
*NL*
very
young
woman
,
and
very
lately
married
.
A
resemblance
in
good
humour
*NL*
and
good
spirits
had
recommended
her
and
Lydia
to
each
other
,
and
out
of
*NL*
their
_
three
_
months
'
acquaintance
they
had
been
intimate
_
two
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rapture
of
Lydia
on
this
occasion
,
her
adoration
of
Mrs.
Forster
,
*NL*
the
delight
of
Mrs.
Bennet
,
and
the
mortification
of
Kitty
,
are
scarcely
*NL*
to
be
described
.
Wholly
inattentive
to
her
sister
's
feelings
,
Lydia
*NL*
flew
about
the
house
in
restless
ecstasy
,
calling
for
everyone
's
*NL*
congratulations
,
and
laughing
and
talking
with
more
violence
than
ever
;
*NL*
whilst
the
luckless
Kitty
continued
in
the
parlour
repined
at
her
fate
*NL*
in
terms
as
unreasonable
as
her
accent
was
peevish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
see
why
Mrs.
Forster
should
not
ask
_
me
_
as
well
as
Lydia
,
''
*NL*
said
she
,
``
Though
I
am
_
not
_
her
particular
friend
.
I
have
just
as
much
*NL*
right
to
be
asked
as
she
has
,
and
more
too
,
for
I
am
two
years
older
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
did
Elizabeth
attempt
to
make
her
reasonable
,
and
Jane
to
make
*NL*
her
resigned
.
As
for
Elizabeth
herself
,
this
invitation
was
so
far
from
*NL*
exciting
in
her
the
same
feelings
as
in
her
mother
and
Lydia
,
that
she
*NL*
considered
it
as
the
death
warrant
of
all
possibility
of
common
sense
*NL*
for
the
latter
;
and
detestable
as
such
a
step
must
make
her
were
it
*NL*
known
,
she
could
not
help
secretly
advising
her
father
not
to
let
her
*NL*
go
.
She
represented
to
him
all
the
improprieties
of
Lydia
's
general
*NL*
behaviour
,
the
little
advantage
she
could
derive
from
the
friendship
of
*NL*
such
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Forster
,
and
the
probability
of
her
being
yet
more
*NL*
imprudent
with
such
a
companion
at
Brighton
,
where
the
temptations
must
*NL*
be
greater
than
at
home
.
He
heard
her
attentively
,
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lydia
will
never
be
easy
until
she
has
exposed
herself
in
some
public
*NL*
place
or
other
,
and
we
can
never
expect
her
to
do
it
with
so
*NL*
little
expense
or
inconvenience
to
her
family
as
under
the
present
*NL*
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
aware
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
of
the
very
great
disadvantage
to
*NL*
us
all
which
must
arise
from
the
public
notice
of
Lydia
's
unguarded
and
*NL*
imprudent
manner
--
nay
,
which
has
already
arisen
from
it
,
I
am
sure
you
*NL*
would
judge
differently
in
the
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Already
arisen
?
''
repeated
Mr.
Bennet
.
``
What
,
has
she
frightened
away
*NL*
some
of
your
lovers
?
Poor
little
Lizzy
!
But
do
not
be
cast
down
.
Such
*NL*
squeamish
youths
as
can
not
bear
to
be
connected
with
a
little
absurdity
*NL*
are
not
worth
a
regret
.
Come
,
let
me
see
the
list
of
pitiful
fellows
who
*NL*
have
been
kept
aloof
by
Lydia
's
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
are
mistaken
.
I
have
no
such
injuries
to
resent
.
It
is
not
*NL*
of
particular
,
but
of
general
evils
,
which
I
am
now
complaining
.
Our
*NL*
importance
,
our
respectability
in
the
world
must
be
affected
by
the
*NL*
wild
volatility
,
the
assurance
and
disdain
of
all
restraint
which
mark
*NL*
Lydia
's
character
.
Excuse
me
,
for
I
must
speak
plainly
.
If
you
,
my
dear
*NL*
father
,
will
not
take
the
trouble
of
checking
her
exuberant
spirits
,
and
*NL*
of
teaching
her
that
her
present
pursuits
are
not
to
be
the
business
of
*NL*
her
life
,
she
will
soon
be
beyond
the
reach
of
amendment
.
Her
character
*NL*
will
be
fixed
,
and
she
will
,
at
sixteen
,
be
the
most
determined
flirt
*NL*
that
ever
made
herself
or
her
family
ridiculous
;
a
flirt
,
too
,
in
the
*NL*
worst
and
meanest
degree
of
flirtation
;
without
any
attraction
beyond
*NL*
youth
and
a
tolerable
person
;
and
,
from
the
ignorance
and
emptiness
*NL*
of
her
mind
,
wholly
unable
to
ward
off
any
portion
of
that
universal
*NL*
contempt
which
her
rage
for
admiration
will
excite
.
In
this
danger
*NL*
Kitty
also
is
comprehended
.
She
will
follow
wherever
Lydia
leads
.
Vain
,
*NL*
ignorant
,
idle
,
and
absolutely
uncontrolled
!
Oh
!
my
dear
father
,
can
you
*NL*
suppose
it
possible
that
they
will
not
be
censured
and
despised
wherever
*NL*
they
are
known
,
and
that
their
sisters
will
not
be
often
involved
in
the
*NL*
disgrace
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
saw
that
her
whole
heart
was
in
the
subject
,
and
*NL*
affectionately
taking
her
hand
said
in
reply
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
,
my
love
.
Wherever
you
and
Jane
are
known
*NL*
you
must
be
respected
and
valued
;
and
you
will
not
appear
to
less
*NL*
advantage
for
having
a
couple
of
--
or
I
may
say
,
three
--
very
silly
*NL*
sisters
.
We
shall
have
no
peace
at
Longbourn
if
Lydia
does
not
go
to
*NL*
Brighton
.
Let
her
go
,
then
.
Colonel
Forster
is
a
sensible
man
,
and
will
*NL*
keep
her
out
of
any
real
mischief
;
and
she
is
luckily
too
poor
to
be
an
*NL*
object
of
prey
to
anybody
.
At
Brighton
she
will
be
of
less
importance
*NL*
even
as
a
common
flirt
than
she
has
been
here
.
The
officers
will
find
*NL*
women
better
worth
their
notice
.
Let
us
hope
,
therefore
,
that
her
being
*NL*
there
may
teach
her
her
own
insignificance
.
At
any
rate
,
she
can
not
grow
*NL*
many
degrees
worse
,
without
authorising
us
to
lock
her
up
for
the
rest
*NL*
of
her
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
answer
Elizabeth
was
forced
to
be
content
;
but
her
own
opinion
*NL*
continued
the
same
,
and
she
left
him
disappointed
and
sorry
.
It
was
not
*NL*
in
her
nature
,
however
,
to
increase
her
vexations
by
dwelling
on
*NL*
them
.
She
was
confident
of
having
performed
her
duty
,
and
to
fret
*NL*
over
unavoidable
evils
,
or
augment
them
by
anxiety
,
was
no
part
of
her
*NL*
disposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Lydia
and
her
mother
known
the
substance
of
her
conference
with
her
*NL*
father
,
their
indignation
would
hardly
have
found
expression
in
their
*NL*
united
volubility
.
In
Lydia
's
imagination
,
a
visit
to
Brighton
comprised
*NL*
every
possibility
of
earthly
happiness
.
She
saw
,
with
the
creative
eye
*NL*
of
fancy
,
the
streets
of
that
gay
bathing-place
covered
with
officers
.
*NL*
She
saw
herself
the
object
of
attention
,
to
tens
and
to
scores
of
them
*NL*
at
present
unknown
.
She
saw
all
the
glories
of
the
camp
--
its
tents
*NL*
stretched
forth
in
beauteous
uniformity
of
lines
,
crowded
with
the
young
*NL*
and
the
gay
,
and
dazzling
with
scarlet
;
and
,
to
complete
the
view
,
she
*NL*
saw
herself
seated
beneath
a
tent
,
tenderly
flirting
with
at
least
six
*NL*
officers
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
she
known
her
sister
sought
to
tear
her
from
such
prospects
and
such
*NL*
realities
as
these
,
what
would
have
been
her
sensations
?
They
could
have
*NL*
been
understood
only
by
her
mother
,
who
might
have
felt
nearly
the
same
.
*NL*
Lydia
's
going
to
Brighton
was
all
that
consoled
her
for
her
melancholy
*NL*
conviction
of
her
husband
's
never
intending
to
go
there
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
were
entirely
ignorant
of
what
had
passed
;
and
their
raptures
*NL*
continued
,
with
little
intermission
,
to
the
very
day
of
Lydia
's
leaving
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
now
to
see
Mr.
Wickham
for
the
last
time
.
Having
been
*NL*
frequently
in
company
with
him
since
her
return
,
agitation
was
pretty
*NL*
well
over
;
the
agitations
of
former
partiality
entirely
so
.
She
had
even
*NL*
learnt
to
detect
,
in
the
very
gentleness
which
had
first
delighted
*NL*
her
,
an
affectation
and
a
sameness
to
disgust
and
weary
.
In
his
present
*NL*
behaviour
to
herself
,
moreover
,
she
had
a
fresh
source
of
displeasure
,
*NL*
for
the
inclination
he
soon
testified
of
renewing
those
intentions
which
*NL*
had
marked
the
early
part
of
their
acquaintance
could
only
serve
,
after
*NL*
what
had
since
passed
,
to
provoke
her
.
She
lost
all
concern
for
him
in
*NL*
finding
herself
thus
selected
as
the
object
of
such
idle
and
frivolous
*NL*
gallantry
;
and
while
she
steadily
repressed
it
,
could
not
but
feel
the
*NL*
reproof
contained
in
his
believing
,
that
however
long
,
and
for
whatever
*NL*
cause
,
his
attentions
had
been
withdrawn
,
her
vanity
would
be
gratified
,
*NL*
and
her
preference
secured
at
any
time
by
their
renewal
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
very
last
day
of
the
regiment
's
remaining
at
Meryton
,
he
dined
,
*NL*
with
other
of
the
officers
,
at
Longbourn
;
and
so
little
was
Elizabeth
*NL*
disposed
to
part
from
him
in
good
humour
,
that
on
his
making
some
*NL*
inquiry
as
to
the
manner
in
which
her
time
had
passed
at
Hunsford
,
she
*NL*
mentioned
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
's
and
Mr.
Darcy
's
having
both
spent
three
*NL*
weeks
at
Rosings
,
and
asked
him
,
if
he
was
acquainted
with
the
former
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
surprised
,
displeased
,
alarmed
;
but
with
a
moment
's
*NL*
recollection
and
a
returning
smile
,
replied
,
that
he
had
formerly
seen
*NL*
him
often
;
and
,
after
observing
that
he
was
a
very
gentlemanlike
man
,
*NL*
asked
her
how
she
had
liked
him
.
Her
answer
was
warmly
in
his
favour
.
*NL*
With
an
air
of
indifference
he
soon
afterwards
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
did
you
say
he
was
at
Rosings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
three
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
saw
him
frequently
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
almost
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
manners
are
very
different
from
his
cousin
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
different
.
But
I
think
Mr.
Darcy
improves
upon
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
cried
Mr.
Wickham
with
a
look
which
did
not
escape
her
.
``
And
*NL*
pray
,
may
I
ask
?
--
''
But
checking
himself
,
he
added
,
in
a
gayer
tone
,
``
Is
*NL*
it
in
address
that
he
improves
?
Has
he
deigned
to
add
aught
of
civility
*NL*
to
his
ordinary
style
?
--
for
I
dare
not
hope
,
''
he
continued
in
a
lower
*NL*
and
more
serious
tone
,
``
that
he
is
improved
in
essentials
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
said
Elizabeth
.
``
In
essentials
,
I
believe
,
he
is
very
much
*NL*
what
he
ever
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
spoke
,
Wickham
looked
as
if
scarcely
knowing
whether
to
*NL*
rejoice
over
her
words
,
or
to
distrust
their
meaning
.
There
was
a
*NL*
something
in
her
countenance
which
made
him
listen
with
an
apprehensive
*NL*
and
anxious
attention
,
while
she
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
said
that
he
improved
on
acquaintance
,
I
did
not
mean
that
*NL*
his
mind
or
his
manners
were
in
a
state
of
improvement
,
but
that
,
from
*NL*
knowing
him
better
,
his
disposition
was
better
understood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wickham
's
alarm
now
appeared
in
a
heightened
complexion
and
agitated
*NL*
look
;
for
a
few
minutes
he
was
silent
,
till
,
shaking
off
his
*NL*
embarrassment
,
he
turned
to
her
again
,
and
said
in
the
gentlest
of
*NL*
accents
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
who
so
well
know
my
feeling
towards
Mr.
Darcy
,
will
readily
*NL*
comprehend
how
sincerely
I
must
rejoice
that
he
is
wise
enough
to
assume
*NL*
even
the
_
appearance
_
of
what
is
right
.
His
pride
,
in
that
direction
,
*NL*
may
be
of
service
,
if
not
to
himself
,
to
many
others
,
for
it
must
only
*NL*
deter
him
from
such
foul
misconduct
as
I
have
suffered
by
.
I
only
*NL*
fear
that
the
sort
of
cautiousness
to
which
you
,
I
imagine
,
have
been
*NL*
alluding
,
is
merely
adopted
on
his
visits
to
his
aunt
,
of
whose
good
*NL*
opinion
and
judgement
he
stands
much
in
awe
.
His
fear
of
her
has
always
*NL*
operated
,
I
know
,
when
they
were
together
;
and
a
good
deal
is
to
be
*NL*
imputed
to
his
wish
of
forwarding
the
match
with
Miss
de
Bourgh
,
which
I
*NL*
am
certain
he
has
very
much
at
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
this
,
but
she
answered
only
by
a
*NL*
slight
inclination
of
the
head
.
She
saw
that
he
wanted
to
engage
her
on
*NL*
the
old
subject
of
his
grievances
,
and
she
was
in
no
humour
to
indulge
*NL*
him
.
The
rest
of
the
evening
passed
with
the
_
appearance
_
,
on
his
*NL*
side
,
of
usual
cheerfulness
,
but
with
no
further
attempt
to
distinguish
*NL*
Elizabeth
;
and
they
parted
at
last
with
mutual
civility
,
and
possibly
a
*NL*
mutual
desire
of
never
meeting
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
party
broke
up
,
Lydia
returned
with
Mrs.
Forster
to
Meryton
,
*NL*
from
whence
they
were
to
set
out
early
the
next
morning
.
The
separation
*NL*
between
her
and
her
family
was
rather
noisy
than
pathetic
.
Kitty
was
the
*NL*
only
one
who
shed
tears
;
but
she
did
weep
from
vexation
and
envy
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
was
diffuse
in
her
good
wishes
for
the
felicity
of
her
daughter
,
*NL*
and
impressive
in
her
injunctions
that
she
should
not
miss
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
enjoying
herself
as
much
as
possible
--
advice
which
*NL*
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
would
be
well
attended
to
;
and
in
*NL*
the
clamorous
happiness
of
Lydia
herself
in
bidding
farewell
,
the
more
*NL*
gentle
adieus
of
her
sisters
were
uttered
without
being
heard
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Elizabeth
's
opinion
been
all
drawn
from
her
own
family
,
she
could
*NL*
not
have
formed
a
very
pleasing
opinion
of
conjugal
felicity
or
domestic
*NL*
comfort
.
Her
father
,
captivated
by
youth
and
beauty
,
and
that
appearance
*NL*
of
good
humour
which
youth
and
beauty
generally
give
,
had
married
a
*NL*
woman
whose
weak
understanding
and
illiberal
mind
had
very
early
in
*NL*
their
marriage
put
an
end
to
all
real
affection
for
her
.
Respect
,
*NL*
esteem
,
and
confidence
had
vanished
for
ever
;
and
all
his
views
*NL*
of
domestic
happiness
were
overthrown
.
But
Mr.
Bennet
was
not
of
*NL*
a
disposition
to
seek
comfort
for
the
disappointment
which
his
own
*NL*
imprudence
had
brought
on
,
in
any
of
those
pleasures
which
too
often
*NL*
console
the
unfortunate
for
their
folly
or
their
vice
.
He
was
fond
of
*NL*
the
country
and
of
books
;
and
from
these
tastes
had
arisen
his
principal
*NL*
enjoyments
.
To
his
wife
he
was
very
little
otherwise
indebted
,
than
as
*NL*
her
ignorance
and
folly
had
contributed
to
his
amusement
.
This
is
not
*NL*
the
sort
of
happiness
which
a
man
would
in
general
wish
to
owe
to
his
*NL*
wife
;
but
where
other
powers
of
entertainment
are
wanting
,
the
true
*NL*
philosopher
will
derive
benefit
from
such
as
are
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
however
,
had
never
been
blind
to
the
impropriety
of
her
*NL*
father
's
behaviour
as
a
husband
.
She
had
always
seen
it
with
pain
;
but
*NL*
respecting
his
abilities
,
and
grateful
for
his
affectionate
treatment
of
*NL*
herself
,
she
endeavoured
to
forget
what
she
could
not
overlook
,
and
to
*NL*
banish
from
her
thoughts
that
continual
breach
of
conjugal
obligation
*NL*
and
decorum
which
,
in
exposing
his
wife
to
the
contempt
of
her
own
*NL*
children
,
was
so
highly
reprehensible
.
But
she
had
never
felt
so
*NL*
strongly
as
now
the
disadvantages
which
must
attend
the
children
of
so
*NL*
unsuitable
a
marriage
,
nor
ever
been
so
fully
aware
of
the
evils
arising
*NL*
from
so
ill-judged
a
direction
of
talents
;
talents
,
which
,
rightly
used
,
*NL*
might
at
least
have
preserved
the
respectability
of
his
daughters
,
even
*NL*
if
incapable
of
enlarging
the
mind
of
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Elizabeth
had
rejoiced
over
Wickham
's
departure
she
found
little
*NL*
other
cause
for
satisfaction
in
the
loss
of
the
regiment
.
Their
parties
*NL*
abroad
were
less
varied
than
before
,
and
at
home
she
had
a
mother
and
*NL*
sister
whose
constant
repinings
at
the
dullness
of
everything
around
*NL*
them
threw
a
real
gloom
over
their
domestic
circle
;
and
,
though
Kitty
*NL*
might
in
time
regain
her
natural
degree
of
sense
,
since
the
disturbers
*NL*
of
her
brain
were
removed
,
her
other
sister
,
from
whose
disposition
*NL*
greater
evil
might
be
apprehended
,
was
likely
to
be
hardened
in
all
*NL*
her
folly
and
assurance
by
a
situation
of
such
double
danger
as
a
*NL*
watering-place
and
a
camp
.
Upon
the
whole
,
therefore
,
she
found
,
what
*NL*
has
been
sometimes
found
before
,
that
an
event
to
which
she
had
been
*NL*
looking
with
impatient
desire
did
not
,
in
taking
place
,
bring
all
the
*NL*
satisfaction
she
had
promised
herself
.
It
was
consequently
necessary
to
*NL*
name
some
other
period
for
the
commencement
of
actual
felicity
--
to
have
*NL*
some
other
point
on
which
her
wishes
and
hopes
might
be
fixed
,
and
by
*NL*
again
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
anticipation
,
console
herself
for
the
*NL*
present
,
and
prepare
for
another
disappointment
.
Her
tour
to
the
Lakes
*NL*
was
now
the
object
of
her
happiest
thoughts
;
it
was
her
best
consolation
*NL*
for
all
the
uncomfortable
hours
which
the
discontentedness
of
her
mother
*NL*
and
Kitty
made
inevitable
;
and
could
she
have
included
Jane
in
the
*NL*
scheme
,
every
part
of
it
would
have
been
perfect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
fortunate
,
''
thought
she
,
``
that
I
have
something
to
wish
for
.
*NL*
Were
the
whole
arrangement
complete
,
my
disappointment
would
be
certain
.
*NL*
But
here
,
by
carrying
with
me
one
ceaseless
source
of
regret
in
my
*NL*
sister
's
absence
,
I
may
reasonably
hope
to
have
all
my
expectations
of
*NL*
pleasure
realised
.
A
scheme
of
which
every
part
promises
delight
can
*NL*
never
be
successful
;
and
general
disappointment
is
only
warded
off
by
*NL*
the
defence
of
some
little
peculiar
vexation
.

*NL*
*NL*
When
Lydia
went
away
she
promised
to
write
very
often
and
very
minutely
*NL*
to
her
mother
and
Kitty
;
but
her
letters
were
always
long
expected
,
and
*NL*
always
very
short
.
Those
to
her
mother
contained
little
else
than
that
*NL*
they
were
just
returned
from
the
library
,
where
such
and
such
officers
*NL*
had
attended
them
,
and
where
she
had
seen
such
beautiful
ornaments
as
*NL*
made
her
quite
wild
;
that
she
had
a
new
gown
,
or
a
new
parasol
,
which
*NL*
she
would
have
described
more
fully
,
but
was
obliged
to
leave
off
in
a
*NL*
violent
hurry
,
as
Mrs.
Forster
called
her
,
and
they
were
going
off
to
*NL*
the
camp
;
and
from
her
correspondence
with
her
sister
,
there
was
still
*NL*
less
to
be
learnt
--
for
her
letters
to
Kitty
,
though
rather
longer
,
were
*NL*
much
too
full
of
lines
under
the
words
to
be
made
public
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
first
fortnight
or
three
weeks
of
her
absence
,
health
,
good
*NL*
humour
,
and
cheerfulness
began
to
reappear
at
Longbourn
.
Everything
wore
*NL*
a
happier
aspect
.
The
families
who
had
been
in
town
for
the
winter
came
*NL*
back
again
,
and
summer
finery
and
summer
engagements
arose
.
Mrs.
Bennet
*NL*
was
restored
to
her
usual
querulous
serenity
;
and
,
by
the
middle
of
*NL*
June
,
Kitty
was
so
much
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
enter
Meryton
without
*NL*
tears
;
an
event
of
such
happy
promise
as
to
make
Elizabeth
hope
that
by
*NL*
the
following
Christmas
she
might
be
so
tolerably
reasonable
as
not
to
*NL*
mention
an
officer
above
once
a
day
,
unless
,
by
some
cruel
and
malicious
*NL*
arrangement
at
the
War
Office
,
another
regiment
should
be
quartered
in
*NL*
Meryton
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
fixed
for
the
beginning
of
their
northern
tour
was
now
fast
*NL*
approaching
,
and
a
fortnight
only
was
wanting
of
it
,
when
a
letter
*NL*
arrived
from
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
which
at
once
delayed
its
commencement
and
*NL*
curtailed
its
extent
.
Mr.
Gardiner
would
be
prevented
by
business
from
*NL*
setting
out
till
a
fortnight
later
in
July
,
and
must
be
in
London
again
*NL*
within
a
month
,
and
as
that
left
too
short
a
period
for
them
to
go
so
*NL*
far
,
and
see
so
much
as
they
had
proposed
,
or
at
least
to
see
it
with
*NL*
the
leisure
and
comfort
they
had
built
on
,
they
were
obliged
to
give
up
*NL*
the
Lakes
,
and
substitute
a
more
contracted
tour
,
and
,
according
to
the
*NL*
present
plan
,
were
to
go
no
farther
northwards
than
Derbyshire
.
In
that
*NL*
county
there
was
enough
to
be
seen
to
occupy
the
chief
of
their
three
*NL*
weeks
;
and
to
Mrs.
Gardiner
it
had
a
peculiarly
strong
attraction
.
The
*NL*
town
where
she
had
formerly
passed
some
years
of
her
life
,
and
where
*NL*
they
were
now
to
spend
a
few
days
,
was
probably
as
great
an
object
of
*NL*
her
curiosity
as
all
the
celebrated
beauties
of
Matlock
,
Chatsworth
,
*NL*
Dovedale
,
or
the
Peak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
excessively
disappointed
;
she
had
set
her
heart
on
seeing
*NL*
the
Lakes
,
and
still
thought
there
might
have
been
time
enough
.
But
it
*NL*
was
her
business
to
be
satisfied
--
and
certainly
her
temper
to
be
happy
;
*NL*
and
all
was
soon
right
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
mention
of
Derbyshire
there
were
many
ideas
connected
.
It
was
*NL*
impossible
for
her
to
see
the
word
without
thinking
of
Pemberley
and
its
*NL*
owner
.
``
But
surely
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
may
enter
his
county
with
impunity
,
*NL*
and
rob
it
of
a
few
petrified
spars
without
his
perceiving
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
period
of
expectation
was
now
doubled
.
Four
weeks
were
to
pass
away
*NL*
before
her
uncle
and
aunt
's
arrival
.
But
they
did
pass
away
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
with
their
four
children
,
did
at
length
appear
at
*NL*
Longbourn
.
The
children
,
two
girls
of
six
and
eight
years
old
,
and
two
*NL*
younger
boys
,
were
to
be
left
under
the
particular
care
of
their
*NL*
cousin
Jane
,
who
was
the
general
favourite
,
and
whose
steady
sense
and
*NL*
sweetness
of
temper
exactly
adapted
her
for
attending
to
them
in
every
*NL*
way
--
teaching
them
,
playing
with
them
,
and
loving
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Gardiners
stayed
only
one
night
at
Longbourn
,
and
set
off
the
*NL*
next
morning
with
Elizabeth
in
pursuit
of
novelty
and
amusement
.
*NL*
One
enjoyment
was
certain
--
that
of
suitableness
of
companions
;
*NL*
a
suitableness
which
comprehended
health
and
temper
to
bear
*NL*
inconveniences
--
cheerfulness
to
enhance
every
pleasure
--
and
affection
*NL*
and
intelligence
,
which
might
supply
it
among
themselves
if
there
were
*NL*
disappointments
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
the
object
of
this
work
to
give
a
description
of
Derbyshire
,
*NL*
nor
of
any
of
the
remarkable
places
through
which
their
route
thither
*NL*
lay
;
Oxford
,
Blenheim
,
Warwick
,
Kenilworth
,
Birmingham
,
etc.
are
*NL*
sufficiently
known
.
A
small
part
of
Derbyshire
is
all
the
present
*NL*
concern
.
To
the
little
town
of
Lambton
,
the
scene
of
Mrs.
Gardiner
's
*NL*
former
residence
,
and
where
she
had
lately
learned
some
acquaintance
*NL*
still
remained
,
they
bent
their
steps
,
after
having
seen
all
the
*NL*
principal
wonders
of
the
country
;
and
within
five
miles
of
Lambton
,
*NL*
Elizabeth
found
from
her
aunt
that
Pemberley
was
situated
.
It
was
not
*NL*
in
their
direct
road
,
nor
more
than
a
mile
or
two
out
of
it
.
In
*NL*
talking
over
their
route
the
evening
before
,
Mrs.
Gardiner
expressed
*NL*
an
inclination
to
see
the
place
again
.
Mr.
Gardiner
declared
his
*NL*
willingness
,
and
Elizabeth
was
applied
to
for
her
approbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
should
not
you
like
to
see
a
place
of
which
you
have
heard
*NL*
so
much
?
''
said
her
aunt
;
``
a
place
,
too
,
with
which
so
many
of
your
*NL*
acquaintances
are
connected
.
Wickham
passed
all
his
youth
there
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
distressed
.
She
felt
that
she
had
no
business
at
*NL*
Pemberley
,
and
was
obliged
to
assume
a
disinclination
for
seeing
it
.
She
*NL*
must
own
that
she
was
tired
of
seeing
great
houses
;
after
going
over
so
*NL*
many
,
she
really
had
no
pleasure
in
fine
carpets
or
satin
curtains
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
abused
her
stupidity
.
``
If
it
were
merely
a
fine
house
*NL*
richly
furnished
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
should
not
care
about
it
myself
;
but
*NL*
the
grounds
are
delightful
.
They
have
some
of
the
finest
woods
in
the
*NL*
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
said
no
more
--
but
her
mind
could
not
acquiesce
.
The
*NL*
possibility
of
meeting
Mr.
Darcy
,
while
viewing
the
place
,
instantly
*NL*
occurred
.
It
would
be
dreadful
!
She
blushed
at
the
very
idea
,
and
*NL*
thought
it
would
be
better
to
speak
openly
to
her
aunt
than
to
run
such
*NL*
a
risk
.
But
against
this
there
were
objections
;
and
she
finally
resolved
*NL*
that
it
could
be
the
last
resource
,
if
her
private
inquiries
to
the
*NL*
absence
of
the
family
were
unfavourably
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
when
she
retired
at
night
,
she
asked
the
chambermaid
*NL*
whether
Pemberley
were
not
a
very
fine
place
?
what
was
the
name
of
its
*NL*
proprietor
?
and
,
with
no
little
alarm
,
whether
the
family
were
down
for
*NL*
the
summer
?
A
most
welcome
negative
followed
the
last
question
--
and
her
*NL*
alarms
now
being
removed
,
she
was
at
leisure
to
feel
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
curiosity
to
see
the
house
herself
;
and
when
the
subject
was
revived
the
*NL*
next
morning
,
and
she
was
again
applied
to
,
could
readily
answer
,
and
*NL*
with
a
proper
air
of
indifference
,
that
she
had
not
really
any
dislike
*NL*
to
the
scheme
.
To
Pemberley
,
therefore
,
they
were
to
go
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
as
they
drove
along
,
watched
for
the
first
appearance
of
*NL*
Pemberley
Woods
with
some
perturbation
;
and
when
at
length
they
turned
*NL*
in
at
the
lodge
,
her
spirits
were
in
a
high
flutter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
park
was
very
large
,
and
contained
great
variety
of
ground
.
They
*NL*
entered
it
in
one
of
its
lowest
points
,
and
drove
for
some
time
through
*NL*
a
beautiful
wood
stretching
over
a
wide
extent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
mind
was
too
full
for
conversation
,
but
she
saw
and
admired
*NL*
every
remarkable
spot
and
point
of
view
.
They
gradually
ascended
for
*NL*
half-a-mile
,
and
then
found
themselves
at
the
top
of
a
considerable
*NL*
eminence
,
where
the
wood
ceased
,
and
the
eye
was
instantly
caught
by
*NL*
Pemberley
House
,
situated
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
valley
,
into
which
*NL*
the
road
with
some
abruptness
wound
.
It
was
a
large
,
handsome
stone
*NL*
building
,
standing
well
on
rising
ground
,
and
backed
by
a
ridge
of
*NL*
high
woody
hills
;
and
in
front
,
a
stream
of
some
natural
importance
was
*NL*
swelled
into
greater
,
but
without
any
artificial
appearance
.
Its
banks
*NL*
were
neither
formal
nor
falsely
adorned
.
Elizabeth
was
delighted
.
She
*NL*
had
never
seen
a
place
for
which
nature
had
done
more
,
or
where
natural
*NL*
beauty
had
been
so
little
counteracted
by
an
awkward
taste
.
They
were
*NL*
all
of
them
warm
in
their
admiration
;
and
at
that
moment
she
felt
that
*NL*
to
be
mistress
of
Pemberley
might
be
something
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
descended
the
hill
,
crossed
the
bridge
,
and
drove
to
the
door
;
and
,
*NL*
while
examining
the
nearer
aspect
of
the
house
,
all
her
apprehension
of
*NL*
meeting
its
owner
returned
.
She
dreaded
lest
the
chambermaid
had
been
*NL*
mistaken
.
On
applying
to
see
the
place
,
they
were
admitted
into
the
*NL*
hall
;
and
Elizabeth
,
as
they
waited
for
the
housekeeper
,
had
leisure
to
*NL*
wonder
at
her
being
where
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
housekeeper
came
;
a
respectable-looking
elderly
woman
,
much
less
*NL*
fine
,
and
more
civil
,
than
she
had
any
notion
of
finding
her
.
They
*NL*
followed
her
into
the
dining-parlour
.
It
was
a
large
,
well
proportioned
*NL*
room
,
handsomely
fitted
up
.
Elizabeth
,
after
slightly
surveying
it
,
went
*NL*
to
a
window
to
enjoy
its
prospect
.
The
hill
,
crowned
with
wood
,
which
*NL*
they
had
descended
,
receiving
increased
abruptness
from
the
distance
,
*NL*
was
a
beautiful
object
.
Every
disposition
of
the
ground
was
good
;
and
*NL*
she
looked
on
the
whole
scene
,
the
river
,
the
trees
scattered
on
its
*NL*
banks
and
the
winding
of
the
valley
,
as
far
as
she
could
trace
it
,
*NL*
with
delight
.
As
they
passed
into
other
rooms
these
objects
were
taking
*NL*
different
positions
;
but
from
every
window
there
were
beauties
to
be
*NL*
seen
.
The
rooms
were
lofty
and
handsome
,
and
their
furniture
suitable
to
*NL*
the
fortune
of
its
proprietor
;
but
Elizabeth
saw
,
with
admiration
of
*NL*
his
taste
,
that
it
was
neither
gaudy
nor
uselessly
fine
;
with
less
of
*NL*
splendour
,
and
more
real
elegance
,
than
the
furniture
of
Rosings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
of
this
place
,
''
thought
she
,
``
I
might
have
been
mistress
!
With
*NL*
these
rooms
I
might
now
have
been
familiarly
acquainted
!
Instead
of
*NL*
viewing
them
as
a
stranger
,
I
might
have
rejoiced
in
them
as
my
own
,
and
*NL*
welcomed
to
them
as
visitors
my
uncle
and
aunt
.
But
no
,
''
--
recollecting
*NL*
herself
--
``
that
could
never
be
;
my
uncle
and
aunt
would
have
been
lost
to
*NL*
me
;
I
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
invite
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
lucky
recollection
--
it
saved
her
from
something
very
like
*NL*
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
longed
to
inquire
of
the
housekeeper
whether
her
master
was
really
*NL*
absent
,
but
had
not
the
courage
for
it
.
At
length
however
,
the
question
*NL*
was
asked
by
her
uncle
;
and
she
turned
away
with
alarm
,
while
Mrs.
*NL*
Reynolds
replied
that
he
was
,
adding
,
``
But
we
expect
him
to-morrow
,
with
*NL*
a
large
party
of
friends
.
''
How
rejoiced
was
Elizabeth
that
their
own
*NL*
journey
had
not
by
any
circumstance
been
delayed
a
day
!
*NL*
*NL*
Her
aunt
now
called
her
to
look
at
a
picture
.
She
approached
and
saw
the
*NL*
likeness
of
Mr.
Wickham
,
suspended
,
amongst
several
other
miniatures
,
*NL*
over
the
mantelpiece
.
Her
aunt
asked
her
,
smilingly
,
how
she
liked
it
.
*NL*
The
housekeeper
came
forward
,
and
told
them
it
was
a
picture
of
a
young
*NL*
gentleman
,
the
son
of
her
late
master
's
steward
,
who
had
been
brought
*NL*
up
by
him
at
his
own
expense
.
``
He
is
now
gone
into
the
army
,
''
she
added
;
*NL*
``
but
I
am
afraid
he
has
turned
out
very
wild
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
looked
at
her
niece
with
a
smile
,
but
Elizabeth
could
not
*NL*
return
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
,
''
said
Mrs.
Reynolds
,
pointing
to
another
of
the
miniatures
,
*NL*
``
is
my
master
--
and
very
like
him
.
It
was
drawn
at
the
same
time
as
the
*NL*
other
--
about
eight
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
much
of
your
master
's
fine
person
,
''
said
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
picture
;
``
it
is
a
handsome
face
.
But
,
Lizzy
,
you
can
tell
*NL*
us
whether
it
is
like
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Reynolds
respect
for
Elizabeth
seemed
to
increase
on
this
*NL*
intimation
of
her
knowing
her
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
that
young
lady
know
Mr.
Darcy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
coloured
,
and
said
:
``
A
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
not
you
think
him
a
very
handsome
gentleman
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
handsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
know
none
so
handsome
;
but
in
the
gallery
up
stairs
you
*NL*
will
see
a
finer
,
larger
picture
of
him
than
this
.
This
room
was
my
late
*NL*
master
's
favourite
room
,
and
these
miniatures
are
just
as
they
used
to
*NL*
be
then
.
He
was
very
fond
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
accounted
to
Elizabeth
for
Mr.
Wickham
's
being
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Reynolds
then
directed
their
attention
to
one
of
Miss
Darcy
,
drawn
*NL*
when
she
was
only
eight
years
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
Miss
Darcy
as
handsome
as
her
brother
?
''
said
Mrs.
Gardiner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
--
the
handsomest
young
lady
that
ever
was
seen
;
and
so
*NL*
accomplished
!
--
She
plays
and
sings
all
day
long
.
In
the
next
room
is
*NL*
a
new
instrument
just
come
down
for
her
--
a
present
from
my
master
;
she
*NL*
comes
here
to-morrow
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gardiner
,
whose
manners
were
very
easy
and
pleasant
,
encouraged
her
*NL*
communicativeness
by
his
questions
and
remarks
;
Mrs.
Reynolds
,
either
*NL*
by
pride
or
attachment
,
had
evidently
great
pleasure
in
talking
of
her
*NL*
master
and
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
master
much
at
Pemberley
in
the
course
of
the
year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
much
as
I
could
wish
,
sir
;
but
I
dare
say
he
may
spend
half
his
*NL*
time
here
;
and
Miss
Darcy
is
always
down
for
the
summer
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
,
''
thought
Elizabeth
,
``
when
she
goes
to
Ramsgate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
master
would
marry
,
you
might
see
more
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
but
I
do
not
know
when
_
that
_
will
be
.
I
do
not
know
who
is
*NL*
good
enough
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
smiled
.
Elizabeth
could
not
help
saying
,
``
It
is
*NL*
very
much
to
his
credit
,
I
am
sure
,
that
you
should
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
no
more
than
the
truth
,
and
everybody
will
say
that
knows
him
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
other
.
Elizabeth
thought
this
was
going
pretty
far
;
and
she
*NL*
listened
with
increasing
astonishment
as
the
housekeeper
added
,
``
I
have
*NL*
never
known
a
cross
word
from
him
in
my
life
,
and
I
have
known
him
ever
*NL*
since
he
was
four
years
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
praise
,
of
all
others
most
extraordinary
,
most
opposite
to
her
*NL*
ideas
.
That
he
was
not
a
good-tempered
man
had
been
her
firmest
opinion
.
*NL*
Her
keenest
attention
was
awakened
;
she
longed
to
hear
more
,
and
was
*NL*
grateful
to
her
uncle
for
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
very
few
people
of
whom
so
much
can
be
said
.
You
are
lucky
in
*NL*
having
such
a
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
I
know
I
am
.
If
I
were
to
go
through
the
world
,
I
could
*NL*
not
meet
with
a
better
.
But
I
have
always
observed
,
that
they
who
are
*NL*
good-natured
when
children
,
are
good-natured
when
they
grow
up
;
and
*NL*
he
was
always
the
sweetest-tempered
,
most
generous-hearted
boy
in
the
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
almost
stared
at
her
.
``
Can
this
be
Mr.
Darcy
?
''
thought
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
father
was
an
excellent
man
,
''
said
Mrs.
Gardiner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
that
he
was
indeed
;
and
his
son
will
be
just
like
him
--
just
*NL*
as
affable
to
the
poor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
listened
,
wondered
,
doubted
,
and
was
impatient
for
more
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Reynolds
could
interest
her
on
no
other
point
.
She
related
the
subjects
*NL*
of
the
pictures
,
the
dimensions
of
the
rooms
,
and
the
price
of
the
*NL*
furniture
,
in
vain
.
Mr.
Gardiner
,
highly
amused
by
the
kind
of
family
*NL*
prejudice
to
which
he
attributed
her
excessive
commendation
of
her
*NL*
master
,
soon
led
again
to
the
subject
;
and
she
dwelt
with
energy
on
his
*NL*
many
merits
as
they
proceeded
together
up
the
great
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
the
best
landlord
,
and
the
best
master
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
ever
*NL*
lived
;
not
like
the
wild
young
men
nowadays
,
who
think
of
nothing
but
*NL*
themselves
.
There
is
not
one
of
his
tenants
or
servants
but
will
give
*NL*
him
a
good
name
.
Some
people
call
him
proud
;
but
I
am
sure
I
never
saw
*NL*
anything
of
it
.
To
my
fancy
,
it
is
only
because
he
does
not
rattle
away
*NL*
like
other
young
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
an
amiable
light
does
this
place
him
!
''
thought
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
fine
account
of
him
,
''
whispered
her
aunt
as
they
walked
,
``
is
not
*NL*
quite
consistent
with
his
behaviour
to
our
poor
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
we
might
be
deceived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
very
likely
;
our
authority
was
too
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
spacious
lobby
above
they
were
shown
into
a
very
pretty
*NL*
sitting-room
,
lately
fitted
up
with
greater
elegance
and
lightness
than
*NL*
the
apartments
below
;
and
were
informed
that
it
was
but
just
done
to
*NL*
give
pleasure
to
Miss
Darcy
,
who
had
taken
a
liking
to
the
room
when
*NL*
last
at
Pemberley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
certainly
a
good
brother
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
as
she
walked
towards
*NL*
one
of
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Reynolds
anticipated
Miss
Darcy
's
delight
,
when
she
should
enter
*NL*
the
room
.
``
And
this
is
always
the
way
with
him
,
''
she
added
.
``
Whatever
*NL*
can
give
his
sister
any
pleasure
is
sure
to
be
done
in
a
moment
.
There
*NL*
is
nothing
he
would
not
do
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
picture-gallery
,
and
two
or
three
of
the
principal
bedrooms
,
were
*NL*
all
that
remained
to
be
shown
.
In
the
former
were
many
good
paintings
;
*NL*
but
Elizabeth
knew
nothing
of
the
art
;
and
from
such
as
had
been
already
*NL*
visible
below
,
she
had
willingly
turned
to
look
at
some
drawings
of
Miss
*NL*
Darcy
's
,
in
crayons
,
whose
subjects
were
usually
more
interesting
,
and
*NL*
also
more
intelligible
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
gallery
there
were
many
family
portraits
,
but
they
could
have
*NL*
little
to
fix
the
attention
of
a
stranger
.
Elizabeth
walked
in
quest
of
*NL*
the
only
face
whose
features
would
be
known
to
her
.
At
last
it
arrested
*NL*
her
--
and
she
beheld
a
striking
resemblance
to
Mr.
Darcy
,
with
such
a
*NL*
smile
over
the
face
as
she
remembered
to
have
sometimes
seen
when
he
*NL*
looked
at
her
.
She
stood
several
minutes
before
the
picture
,
in
earnest
*NL*
contemplation
,
and
returned
to
it
again
before
they
quitted
the
gallery
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Reynolds
informed
them
that
it
had
been
taken
in
his
father
's
*NL*
lifetime
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
certainly
at
this
moment
,
in
Elizabeth
's
mind
,
a
more
gentle
*NL*
sensation
towards
the
original
than
she
had
ever
felt
at
the
height
of
*NL*
their
acquaintance
.
The
commendation
bestowed
on
him
by
Mrs.
Reynolds
*NL*
was
of
no
trifling
nature
.
What
praise
is
more
valuable
than
the
praise
*NL*
of
an
intelligent
servant
?
As
a
brother
,
a
landlord
,
a
master
,
she
*NL*
considered
how
many
people
's
happiness
were
in
his
guardianship
!
--
how
*NL*
much
of
pleasure
or
pain
was
it
in
his
power
to
bestow
!
--
how
much
of
*NL*
good
or
evil
must
be
done
by
him
!
Every
idea
that
had
been
brought
*NL*
forward
by
the
housekeeper
was
favourable
to
his
character
,
and
as
she
*NL*
stood
before
the
canvas
on
which
he
was
represented
,
and
fixed
his
*NL*
eyes
upon
herself
,
she
thought
of
his
regard
with
a
deeper
sentiment
of
*NL*
gratitude
than
it
had
ever
raised
before
;
she
remembered
its
warmth
,
and
*NL*
softened
its
impropriety
of
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
all
of
the
house
that
was
open
to
general
inspection
had
been
seen
,
*NL*
they
returned
downstairs
,
and
,
taking
leave
of
the
housekeeper
,
were
*NL*
consigned
over
to
the
gardener
,
who
met
them
at
the
hall-door
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
walked
across
the
hall
towards
the
river
,
Elizabeth
turned
back
*NL*
to
look
again
;
her
uncle
and
aunt
stopped
also
,
and
while
the
former
*NL*
was
conjecturing
as
to
the
date
of
the
building
,
the
owner
of
it
himself
*NL*
suddenly
came
forward
from
the
road
,
which
led
behind
it
to
the
stables
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
within
twenty
yards
of
each
other
,
and
so
abrupt
was
his
*NL*
appearance
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
his
sight
.
Their
eyes
*NL*
instantly
met
,
and
the
cheeks
of
both
were
overspread
with
the
deepest
*NL*
blush
.
He
absolutely
started
,
and
for
a
moment
seemed
immovable
from
*NL*
surprise
;
but
shortly
recovering
himself
,
advanced
towards
the
party
,
*NL*
and
spoke
to
Elizabeth
,
if
not
in
terms
of
perfect
composure
,
at
least
*NL*
of
perfect
civility
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
instinctively
turned
away
;
but
stopping
on
his
approach
,
*NL*
received
his
compliments
with
an
embarrassment
impossible
to
be
*NL*
overcome
.
Had
his
first
appearance
,
or
his
resemblance
to
the
picture
*NL*
they
had
just
been
examining
,
been
insufficient
to
assure
the
other
two
*NL*
that
they
now
saw
Mr.
Darcy
,
the
gardener
's
expression
of
surprise
,
on
*NL*
beholding
his
master
,
must
immediately
have
told
it
.
They
stood
a
little
*NL*
aloof
while
he
was
talking
to
their
niece
,
who
,
astonished
and
confused
,
*NL*
scarcely
dared
lift
her
eyes
to
his
face
,
and
knew
not
what
answer
*NL*
she
returned
to
his
civil
inquiries
after
her
family
.
Amazed
at
the
*NL*
alteration
of
his
manner
since
they
last
parted
,
every
sentence
that
*NL*
he
uttered
was
increasing
her
embarrassment
;
and
every
idea
of
the
*NL*
impropriety
of
her
being
found
there
recurring
to
her
mind
,
the
few
*NL*
minutes
in
which
they
continued
were
some
of
the
most
uncomfortable
in
*NL*
her
life
.
Nor
did
he
seem
much
more
at
ease
;
when
he
spoke
,
his
accent
*NL*
had
none
of
its
usual
sedateness
;
and
he
repeated
his
inquiries
as
*NL*
to
the
time
of
her
having
left
Longbourn
,
and
of
her
having
stayed
in
*NL*
Derbyshire
,
so
often
,
and
in
so
hurried
a
way
,
as
plainly
spoke
the
*NL*
distraction
of
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
every
idea
seemed
to
fail
him
;
and
,
after
standing
a
few
*NL*
moments
without
saying
a
word
,
he
suddenly
recollected
himself
,
and
took
*NL*
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
then
joined
her
,
and
expressed
admiration
of
his
figure
;
but
*NL*
Elizabeth
heard
not
a
word
,
and
wholly
engrossed
by
her
own
feelings
,
*NL*
followed
them
in
silence
.
She
was
overpowered
by
shame
and
vexation
.
Her
*NL*
coming
there
was
the
most
unfortunate
,
the
most
ill-judged
thing
in
the
*NL*
world
!
How
strange
it
must
appear
to
him
!
In
what
a
disgraceful
light
*NL*
might
it
not
strike
so
vain
a
man
!
It
might
seem
as
if
she
had
purposely
*NL*
thrown
herself
in
his
way
again
!
Oh
!
why
did
she
come
?
Or
,
why
did
he
*NL*
thus
come
a
day
before
he
was
expected
?
Had
they
been
only
ten
minutes
*NL*
sooner
,
they
should
have
been
beyond
the
reach
of
his
discrimination
;
*NL*
for
it
was
plain
that
he
was
that
moment
arrived
--
that
moment
alighted
*NL*
from
his
horse
or
his
carriage
.
She
blushed
again
and
again
over
*NL*
the
perverseness
of
the
meeting
.
And
his
behaviour
,
so
strikingly
*NL*
altered
--
what
could
it
mean
?
That
he
should
even
speak
to
her
was
*NL*
amazing
!
--
but
to
speak
with
such
civility
,
to
inquire
after
her
family
!
*NL*
Never
in
her
life
had
she
seen
his
manners
so
little
dignified
,
never
*NL*
had
he
spoken
with
such
gentleness
as
on
this
unexpected
meeting
.
What
*NL*
a
contrast
did
it
offer
to
his
last
address
in
Rosings
Park
,
when
he
put
*NL*
his
letter
into
her
hand
!
She
knew
not
what
to
think
,
or
how
to
account
*NL*
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
now
entered
a
beautiful
walk
by
the
side
of
the
water
,
and
*NL*
every
step
was
bringing
forward
a
nobler
fall
of
ground
,
or
a
finer
*NL*
reach
of
the
woods
to
which
they
were
approaching
;
but
it
was
some
time
*NL*
before
Elizabeth
was
sensible
of
any
of
it
;
and
,
though
she
answered
*NL*
mechanically
to
the
repeated
appeals
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
direct
her
eyes
to
such
objects
as
they
pointed
out
,
she
*NL*
distinguished
no
part
of
the
scene
.
Her
thoughts
were
all
fixed
on
that
*NL*
one
spot
of
Pemberley
House
,
whichever
it
might
be
,
where
Mr.
Darcy
then
*NL*
was
.
She
longed
to
know
what
at
the
moment
was
passing
in
his
mind
--
in
*NL*
what
manner
he
thought
of
her
,
and
whether
,
in
defiance
of
everything
,
*NL*
she
was
still
dear
to
him
.
Perhaps
he
had
been
civil
only
because
he
*NL*
felt
himself
at
ease
;
yet
there
had
been
_
that
_
in
his
voice
which
was
*NL*
not
like
ease
.
Whether
he
had
felt
more
of
pain
or
of
pleasure
in
*NL*
seeing
her
she
could
not
tell
,
but
he
certainly
had
not
seen
her
with
*NL*
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
however
,
the
remarks
of
her
companions
on
her
absence
of
mind
*NL*
aroused
her
,
and
she
felt
the
necessity
of
appearing
more
like
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
the
woods
,
and
bidding
adieu
to
the
river
for
a
while
,
*NL*
ascended
some
of
the
higher
grounds
;
when
,
in
spots
where
the
opening
of
*NL*
the
trees
gave
the
eye
power
to
wander
,
were
many
charming
views
of
the
*NL*
valley
,
the
opposite
hills
,
with
the
long
range
of
woods
overspreading
*NL*
many
,
and
occasionally
part
of
the
stream
.
Mr.
Gardiner
expressed
a
wish
*NL*
of
going
round
the
whole
park
,
but
feared
it
might
be
beyond
a
walk
.
*NL*
With
a
triumphant
smile
they
were
told
that
it
was
ten
miles
round
.
*NL*
It
settled
the
matter
;
and
they
pursued
the
accustomed
circuit
;
which
*NL*
brought
them
again
,
after
some
time
,
in
a
descent
among
hanging
woods
,
*NL*
to
the
edge
of
the
water
,
and
one
of
its
narrowest
parts
.
They
crossed
*NL*
it
by
a
simple
bridge
,
in
character
with
the
general
air
of
the
scene
;
*NL*
it
was
a
spot
less
adorned
than
any
they
had
yet
visited
;
and
the
*NL*
valley
,
here
contracted
into
a
glen
,
allowed
room
only
for
the
stream
,
*NL*
and
a
narrow
walk
amidst
the
rough
coppice-wood
which
bordered
it
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
longed
to
explore
its
windings
;
but
when
they
had
crossed
the
*NL*
bridge
,
and
perceived
their
distance
from
the
house
,
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
*NL*
who
was
not
a
great
walker
,
could
go
no
farther
,
and
thought
only
*NL*
of
returning
to
the
carriage
as
quickly
as
possible
.
Her
niece
was
,
*NL*
therefore
,
obliged
to
submit
,
and
they
took
their
way
towards
the
house
*NL*
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
,
in
the
nearest
direction
;
but
their
*NL*
progress
was
slow
,
for
Mr.
Gardiner
,
though
seldom
able
to
indulge
the
*NL*
taste
,
was
very
fond
of
fishing
,
and
was
so
much
engaged
in
watching
the
*NL*
occasional
appearance
of
some
trout
in
the
water
,
and
talking
to
the
*NL*
man
about
them
,
that
he
advanced
but
little
.
Whilst
wandering
on
in
this
*NL*
slow
manner
,
they
were
again
surprised
,
and
Elizabeth
's
astonishment
*NL*
was
quite
equal
to
what
it
had
been
at
first
,
by
the
sight
of
Mr.
Darcy
*NL*
approaching
them
,
and
at
no
great
distance
.
The
walk
being
here
*NL*
less
sheltered
than
on
the
other
side
,
allowed
them
to
see
him
before
*NL*
they
met
.
Elizabeth
,
however
astonished
,
was
at
least
more
prepared
*NL*
for
an
interview
than
before
,
and
resolved
to
appear
and
to
speak
with
*NL*
calmness
,
if
he
really
intended
to
meet
them
.
For
a
few
moments
,
indeed
,
*NL*
she
felt
that
he
would
probably
strike
into
some
other
path
.
The
idea
*NL*
lasted
while
a
turning
in
the
walk
concealed
him
from
their
view
;
the
*NL*
turning
past
,
he
was
immediately
before
them
.
With
a
glance
,
she
saw
*NL*
that
he
had
lost
none
of
his
recent
civility
;
and
,
to
imitate
his
*NL*
politeness
,
she
began
,
as
they
met
,
to
admire
the
beauty
of
the
place
;
*NL*
but
she
had
not
got
beyond
the
words
``
delightful
,
''
and
``
charming
,
''
when
*NL*
some
unlucky
recollections
obtruded
,
and
she
fancied
that
praise
of
*NL*
Pemberley
from
her
might
be
mischievously
construed
.
Her
colour
changed
,
*NL*
and
she
said
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
was
standing
a
little
behind
;
and
on
her
pausing
,
he
asked
*NL*
her
if
she
would
do
him
the
honour
of
introducing
him
to
her
friends
.
*NL*
This
was
a
stroke
of
civility
for
which
she
was
quite
unprepared
;
*NL*
and
she
could
hardly
suppress
a
smile
at
his
being
now
seeking
the
*NL*
acquaintance
of
some
of
those
very
people
against
whom
his
pride
had
*NL*
revolted
in
his
offer
to
herself
.
``
What
will
be
his
surprise
,
''
thought
*NL*
she
,
``
when
he
knows
who
they
are
?
He
takes
them
now
for
people
of
*NL*
fashion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
introduction
,
however
,
was
immediately
made
;
and
as
she
named
their
*NL*
relationship
to
herself
,
she
stole
a
sly
look
at
him
,
to
see
how
he
bore
*NL*
it
,
and
was
not
without
the
expectation
of
his
decamping
as
fast
as
he
*NL*
could
from
such
disgraceful
companions
.
That
he
was
_
surprised
_
by
the
*NL*
connection
was
evident
;
he
sustained
it
,
however
,
with
fortitude
,
and
*NL*
so
far
from
going
away
,
turned
back
with
them
,
and
entered
into
*NL*
conversation
with
Mr.
Gardiner
.
Elizabeth
could
not
but
be
pleased
,
*NL*
could
not
but
triumph
.
It
was
consoling
that
he
should
know
she
had
*NL*
some
relations
for
whom
there
was
no
need
to
blush
.
She
listened
most
*NL*
attentively
to
all
that
passed
between
them
,
and
gloried
in
every
*NL*
expression
,
every
sentence
of
her
uncle
,
which
marked
his
intelligence
,
*NL*
his
taste
,
or
his
good
manners
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
soon
turned
upon
fishing
;
and
she
heard
Mr.
Darcy
*NL*
invite
him
,
with
the
greatest
civility
,
to
fish
there
as
often
as
he
*NL*
chose
while
he
continued
in
the
neighbourhood
,
offering
at
the
same
time
*NL*
to
supply
him
with
fishing
tackle
,
and
pointing
out
those
parts
of
*NL*
the
stream
where
there
was
usually
most
sport
.
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
who
was
*NL*
walking
arm-in-arm
with
Elizabeth
,
gave
her
a
look
expressive
of
wonder
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
said
nothing
,
but
it
gratified
her
exceedingly
;
the
compliment
*NL*
must
be
all
for
herself
.
Her
astonishment
,
however
,
was
extreme
,
and
*NL*
continually
was
she
repeating
,
``
Why
is
he
so
altered
?
From
what
can
*NL*
it
proceed
?
It
can
not
be
for
_
me
_
--
it
can
not
be
for
_
my
_
sake
that
his
*NL*
manners
are
thus
softened
.
My
reproofs
at
Hunsford
could
not
work
such
a
*NL*
change
as
this
.
It
is
impossible
that
he
should
still
love
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
walking
some
time
in
this
way
,
the
two
ladies
in
front
,
the
two
*NL*
gentlemen
behind
,
on
resuming
their
places
,
after
descending
to
*NL*
the
brink
of
the
river
for
the
better
inspection
of
some
curious
*NL*
water-plant
,
there
chanced
to
be
a
little
alteration
.
It
originated
*NL*
in
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
who
,
fatigued
by
the
exercise
of
the
morning
,
found
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
arm
inadequate
to
her
support
,
and
consequently
preferred
*NL*
her
husband
's
.
Mr.
Darcy
took
her
place
by
her
niece
,
and
they
walked
on
*NL*
together
.
After
a
short
silence
,
the
lady
first
spoke
.
She
wished
him
*NL*
to
know
that
she
had
been
assured
of
his
absence
before
she
came
to
the
*NL*
place
,
and
accordingly
began
by
observing
,
that
his
arrival
had
been
*NL*
very
unexpected
--
``
for
your
housekeeper
,
''
she
added
,
``
informed
us
that
*NL*
you
would
certainly
not
be
here
till
to-morrow
;
and
indeed
,
before
we
*NL*
left
Bakewell
,
we
understood
that
you
were
not
immediately
expected
*NL*
in
the
country
.
''
He
acknowledged
the
truth
of
it
all
,
and
said
that
*NL*
business
with
his
steward
had
occasioned
his
coming
forward
a
few
hours
*NL*
before
the
rest
of
the
party
with
whom
he
had
been
travelling
.
``
They
*NL*
will
join
me
early
to-morrow
,
''
he
continued
,
``
and
among
them
are
some
*NL*
who
will
claim
an
acquaintance
with
you
--
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sisters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
answered
only
by
a
slight
bow
.
Her
thoughts
were
instantly
*NL*
driven
back
to
the
time
when
Mr.
Bingley
's
name
had
been
the
last
*NL*
mentioned
between
them
;
and
,
if
she
might
judge
by
his
complexion
,
_
his
_
*NL*
mind
was
not
very
differently
engaged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
also
one
other
person
in
the
party
,
''
he
continued
after
a
*NL*
pause
,
``
who
more
particularly
wishes
to
be
known
to
you
.
Will
you
allow
*NL*
me
,
or
do
I
ask
too
much
,
to
introduce
my
sister
to
your
acquaintance
*NL*
during
your
stay
at
Lambton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
surprise
of
such
an
application
was
great
indeed
;
it
was
too
great
*NL*
for
her
to
know
in
what
manner
she
acceded
to
it
.
She
immediately
felt
*NL*
that
whatever
desire
Miss
Darcy
might
have
of
being
acquainted
with
her
*NL*
must
be
the
work
of
her
brother
,
and
,
without
looking
farther
,
it
was
*NL*
satisfactory
;
it
was
gratifying
to
know
that
his
resentment
had
not
made
*NL*
him
think
really
ill
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
now
walked
on
in
silence
,
each
of
them
deep
in
thought
.
Elizabeth
*NL*
was
not
comfortable
;
that
was
impossible
;
but
she
was
flattered
and
*NL*
pleased
.
His
wish
of
introducing
his
sister
to
her
was
a
compliment
of
*NL*
the
highest
kind
.
They
soon
outstripped
the
others
,
and
when
they
had
*NL*
reached
the
carriage
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
were
half
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
mile
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
asked
her
to
walk
into
the
house
--
but
she
declared
herself
not
*NL*
tired
,
and
they
stood
together
on
the
lawn
.
At
such
a
time
much
might
*NL*
have
been
said
,
and
silence
was
very
awkward
.
She
wanted
to
talk
,
but
*NL*
there
seemed
to
be
an
embargo
on
every
subject
.
At
last
she
recollected
*NL*
that
she
had
been
travelling
,
and
they
talked
of
Matlock
and
Dove
Dale
*NL*
with
great
perseverance
.
Yet
time
and
her
aunt
moved
slowly
--
and
her
*NL*
patience
and
her
ideas
were
nearly
worn
out
before
the
tete-a-tete
was
*NL*
over
.
On
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
's
coming
up
they
were
all
pressed
to
go
*NL*
into
the
house
and
take
some
refreshment
;
but
this
was
declined
,
and
*NL*
they
parted
on
each
side
with
utmost
politeness
.
Mr.
Darcy
handed
the
*NL*
ladies
into
the
carriage
;
and
when
it
drove
off
,
Elizabeth
saw
him
*NL*
walking
slowly
towards
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
observations
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
now
began
;
and
each
of
them
*NL*
pronounced
him
to
be
infinitely
superior
to
anything
they
had
expected
.
*NL*
``
He
is
perfectly
well
behaved
,
polite
,
and
unassuming
,
''
said
her
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
_
is
_
something
a
little
stately
in
him
,
to
be
sure
,
''
replied
her
*NL*
aunt
,
``
but
it
is
confined
to
his
air
,
and
is
not
unbecoming
.
I
can
now
*NL*
say
with
the
housekeeper
,
that
though
some
people
may
call
him
proud
,
I
*NL*
have
seen
nothing
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
never
more
surprised
than
by
his
behaviour
to
us
.
It
was
more
*NL*
than
civil
;
it
was
really
attentive
;
and
there
was
no
necessity
for
such
*NL*
attention
.
His
acquaintance
with
Elizabeth
was
very
trifling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
Lizzy
,
''
said
her
aunt
,
``
he
is
not
so
handsome
as
Wickham
;
*NL*
or
,
rather
,
he
has
not
Wickham
's
countenance
,
for
his
features
*NL*
are
perfectly
good
.
But
how
came
you
to
tell
me
that
he
was
so
*NL*
disagreeable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
excused
herself
as
well
as
she
could
;
said
that
she
had
liked
*NL*
him
better
when
they
had
met
in
Kent
than
before
,
and
that
she
had
never
*NL*
seen
him
so
pleasant
as
this
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
he
may
be
a
little
whimsical
in
his
civilities
,
''
replied
*NL*
her
uncle
.
``
Your
great
men
often
are
;
and
therefore
I
shall
not
take
him
*NL*
at
his
word
,
as
he
might
change
his
mind
another
day
,
and
warn
me
off
*NL*
his
grounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
felt
that
they
had
entirely
misunderstood
his
character
,
but
*NL*
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
what
we
have
seen
of
him
,
''
continued
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
``
I
really
*NL*
should
not
have
thought
that
he
could
have
behaved
in
so
cruel
a
way
by
*NL*
anybody
as
he
has
done
by
poor
Wickham
.
He
has
not
an
ill-natured
look
.
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
there
is
something
pleasing
about
his
mouth
when
he
*NL*
speaks
.
And
there
is
something
of
dignity
in
his
countenance
that
would
*NL*
not
give
one
an
unfavourable
idea
of
his
heart
.
But
,
to
be
sure
,
the
*NL*
good
lady
who
showed
us
his
house
did
give
him
a
most
flaming
character
!
*NL*
I
could
hardly
help
laughing
aloud
sometimes
.
But
he
is
a
liberal
*NL*
master
,
I
suppose
,
and
_
that
_
in
the
eye
of
a
servant
comprehends
every
*NL*
virtue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
here
felt
herself
called
on
to
say
something
in
vindication
of
*NL*
his
behaviour
to
Wickham
;
and
therefore
gave
them
to
understand
,
in
*NL*
as
guarded
a
manner
as
she
could
,
that
by
what
she
had
heard
from
*NL*
his
relations
in
Kent
,
his
actions
were
capable
of
a
very
different
*NL*
construction
;
and
that
his
character
was
by
no
means
so
faulty
,
nor
*NL*
Wickham
's
so
amiable
,
as
they
had
been
considered
in
Hertfordshire
.
In
*NL*
confirmation
of
this
,
she
related
the
particulars
of
all
the
pecuniary
*NL*
transactions
in
which
they
had
been
connected
,
without
actually
naming
*NL*
her
authority
,
but
stating
it
to
be
such
as
might
be
relied
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
was
surprised
and
concerned
;
but
as
they
were
now
*NL*
approaching
the
scene
of
her
former
pleasures
,
every
idea
gave
way
to
*NL*
the
charm
of
recollection
;
and
she
was
too
much
engaged
in
pointing
out
*NL*
to
her
husband
all
the
interesting
spots
in
its
environs
to
think
of
*NL*
anything
else
.
Fatigued
as
she
had
been
by
the
morning
's
walk
they
*NL*
had
no
sooner
dined
than
she
set
off
again
in
quest
of
her
former
*NL*
acquaintance
,
and
the
evening
was
spent
in
the
satisfactions
of
a
*NL*
intercourse
renewed
after
many
years
'
discontinuance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
occurrences
of
the
day
were
too
full
of
interest
to
leave
Elizabeth
*NL*
much
attention
for
any
of
these
new
friends
;
and
she
could
do
nothing
*NL*
but
think
,
and
think
with
wonder
,
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
civility
,
and
,
above
*NL*
all
,
of
his
wishing
her
to
be
acquainted
with
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
44
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
settled
it
that
Mr.
Darcy
would
bring
his
sister
to
visit
*NL*
her
the
very
day
after
her
reaching
Pemberley
;
and
was
consequently
*NL*
resolved
not
to
be
out
of
sight
of
the
inn
the
whole
of
that
morning
.
*NL*
But
her
conclusion
was
false
;
for
on
the
very
morning
after
their
*NL*
arrival
at
Lambton
,
these
visitors
came
.
They
had
been
walking
about
the
*NL*
place
with
some
of
their
new
friends
,
and
were
just
returning
to
the
inn
*NL*
to
dress
themselves
for
dining
with
the
same
family
,
when
the
sound
of
a
*NL*
carriage
drew
them
to
a
window
,
and
they
saw
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
in
*NL*
a
curricle
driving
up
the
street
.
Elizabeth
immediately
recognizing
*NL*
the
livery
,
guessed
what
it
meant
,
and
imparted
no
small
degree
of
her
*NL*
surprise
to
her
relations
by
acquainting
them
with
the
honour
which
she
*NL*
expected
.
Her
uncle
and
aunt
were
all
amazement
;
and
the
embarrassment
*NL*
of
her
manner
as
she
spoke
,
joined
to
the
circumstance
itself
,
and
many
*NL*
of
the
circumstances
of
the
preceding
day
,
opened
to
them
a
new
idea
on
*NL*
the
business
.
Nothing
had
ever
suggested
it
before
,
but
they
felt
that
*NL*
there
was
no
other
way
of
accounting
for
such
attentions
from
such
a
*NL*
quarter
than
by
supposing
a
partiality
for
their
niece
.
While
these
*NL*
newly-born
notions
were
passing
in
their
heads
,
the
perturbation
of
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
feelings
was
at
every
moment
increasing
.
She
was
quite
*NL*
amazed
at
her
own
discomposure
;
but
amongst
other
causes
of
disquiet
,
*NL*
she
dreaded
lest
the
partiality
of
the
brother
should
have
said
too
much
*NL*
in
her
favour
;
and
,
more
than
commonly
anxious
to
please
,
she
naturally
*NL*
suspected
that
every
power
of
pleasing
would
fail
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
retreated
from
the
window
,
fearful
of
being
seen
;
and
as
she
walked
*NL*
up
and
down
the
room
,
endeavouring
to
compose
herself
,
saw
such
looks
of
*NL*
inquiring
surprise
in
her
uncle
and
aunt
as
made
everything
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Darcy
and
her
brother
appeared
,
and
this
formidable
introduction
*NL*
took
place
.
With
astonishment
did
Elizabeth
see
that
her
new
*NL*
acquaintance
was
at
least
as
much
embarrassed
as
herself
.
Since
her
*NL*
being
at
Lambton
,
she
had
heard
that
Miss
Darcy
was
exceedingly
proud
;
*NL*
but
the
observation
of
a
very
few
minutes
convinced
her
that
she
was
*NL*
only
exceedingly
shy
.
She
found
it
difficult
to
obtain
even
a
word
from
*NL*
her
beyond
a
monosyllable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Darcy
was
tall
,
and
on
a
larger
scale
than
Elizabeth
;
and
,
though
*NL*
little
more
than
sixteen
,
her
figure
was
formed
,
and
her
appearance
*NL*
womanly
and
graceful
.
She
was
less
handsome
than
her
brother
;
but
there
*NL*
was
sense
and
good
humour
in
her
face
,
and
her
manners
were
perfectly
*NL*
unassuming
and
gentle
.
Elizabeth
,
who
had
expected
to
find
in
her
as
*NL*
acute
and
unembarrassed
an
observer
as
ever
Mr.
Darcy
had
been
,
was
much
*NL*
relieved
by
discerning
such
different
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
long
been
together
before
Mr.
Darcy
told
her
that
Bingley
*NL*
was
also
coming
to
wait
on
her
;
and
she
had
barely
time
to
express
her
*NL*
satisfaction
,
and
prepare
for
such
a
visitor
,
when
Bingley
's
quick
*NL*
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
,
and
in
a
moment
he
entered
the
room
.
All
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
anger
against
him
had
been
long
done
away
;
but
had
she
still
*NL*
felt
any
,
it
could
hardly
have
stood
its
ground
against
the
unaffected
*NL*
cordiality
with
which
he
expressed
himself
on
seeing
her
again
.
He
*NL*
inquired
in
a
friendly
,
though
general
way
,
after
her
family
,
and
looked
*NL*
and
spoke
with
the
same
good-humoured
ease
that
he
had
ever
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
he
was
scarcely
a
less
interesting
personage
*NL*
than
to
herself
.
They
had
long
wished
to
see
him
.
The
whole
party
before
*NL*
them
,
indeed
,
excited
a
lively
attention
.
The
suspicions
which
had
just
*NL*
arisen
of
Mr.
Darcy
and
their
niece
directed
their
observation
towards
*NL*
each
with
an
earnest
though
guarded
inquiry
;
and
they
soon
drew
from
*NL*
those
inquiries
the
full
conviction
that
one
of
them
at
least
knew
*NL*
what
it
was
to
love
.
Of
the
lady
's
sensations
they
remained
a
little
*NL*
in
doubt
;
but
that
the
gentleman
was
overflowing
with
admiration
was
*NL*
evident
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
on
her
side
,
had
much
to
do
.
She
wanted
to
ascertain
the
*NL*
feelings
of
each
of
her
visitors
;
she
wanted
to
compose
her
own
,
and
*NL*
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
all
;
and
in
the
latter
object
,
where
she
*NL*
feared
most
to
fail
,
she
was
most
sure
of
success
,
for
those
to
whom
she
*NL*
endeavoured
to
give
pleasure
were
prepossessed
in
her
favour
.
Bingley
*NL*
was
ready
,
Georgiana
was
eager
,
and
Darcy
determined
,
to
be
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
seeing
Bingley
,
her
thoughts
naturally
flew
to
her
sister
;
and
,
oh
!
*NL*
how
ardently
did
she
long
to
know
whether
any
of
his
were
directed
in
*NL*
a
like
manner
.
Sometimes
she
could
fancy
that
he
talked
less
than
on
*NL*
former
occasions
,
and
once
or
twice
pleased
herself
with
the
notion
*NL*
that
,
as
he
looked
at
her
,
he
was
trying
to
trace
a
resemblance
.
But
,
*NL*
though
this
might
be
imaginary
,
she
could
not
be
deceived
as
to
his
*NL*
behaviour
to
Miss
Darcy
,
who
had
been
set
up
as
a
rival
to
Jane
.
No
look
*NL*
appeared
on
either
side
that
spoke
particular
regard
.
Nothing
occurred
*NL*
between
them
that
could
justify
the
hopes
of
his
sister
.
On
this
point
*NL*
she
was
soon
satisfied
;
and
two
or
three
little
circumstances
occurred
*NL*
ere
they
parted
,
which
,
in
her
anxious
interpretation
,
denoted
a
*NL*
recollection
of
Jane
not
untinctured
by
tenderness
,
and
a
wish
of
saying
*NL*
more
that
might
lead
to
the
mention
of
her
,
had
he
dared
.
He
observed
*NL*
to
her
,
at
a
moment
when
the
others
were
talking
together
,
and
in
a
tone
*NL*
which
had
something
of
real
regret
,
that
it
``
was
a
very
long
time
since
*NL*
he
had
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
;
''
and
,
before
she
could
reply
,
*NL*
he
added
,
``
It
is
above
eight
months
.
We
have
not
met
since
the
26th
of
*NL*
November
,
when
we
were
all
dancing
together
at
Netherfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
pleased
to
find
his
memory
so
exact
;
and
he
afterwards
*NL*
took
occasion
to
ask
her
,
when
unattended
to
by
any
of
the
rest
,
whether
*NL*
_
all
_
her
sisters
were
at
Longbourn
.
There
was
not
much
in
the
question
,
*NL*
nor
in
the
preceding
remark
;
but
there
was
a
look
and
a
manner
which
*NL*
gave
them
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
often
that
she
could
turn
her
eyes
on
Mr.
Darcy
himself
;
*NL*
but
,
whenever
she
did
catch
a
glimpse
,
she
saw
an
expression
of
general
*NL*
complaisance
,
and
in
all
that
he
said
she
heard
an
accent
so
removed
*NL*
from
_
hauteur
_
or
disdain
of
his
companions
,
as
convinced
her
that
*NL*
the
improvement
of
manners
which
she
had
yesterday
witnessed
however
*NL*
temporary
its
existence
might
prove
,
had
at
least
outlived
one
day
.
When
*NL*
she
saw
him
thus
seeking
the
acquaintance
and
courting
the
good
opinion
*NL*
of
people
with
whom
any
intercourse
a
few
months
ago
would
have
been
a
*NL*
disgrace
--
when
she
saw
him
thus
civil
,
not
only
to
herself
,
but
to
the
*NL*
very
relations
whom
he
had
openly
disdained
,
and
recollected
their
last
*NL*
lively
scene
in
Hunsford
Parsonage
--
the
difference
,
the
change
was
*NL*
so
great
,
and
struck
so
forcibly
on
her
mind
,
that
she
could
hardly
*NL*
restrain
her
astonishment
from
being
visible
.
Never
,
even
in
the
company
*NL*
of
his
dear
friends
at
Netherfield
,
or
his
dignified
relations
*NL*
at
Rosings
,
had
she
seen
him
so
desirous
to
please
,
so
free
from
*NL*
self-consequence
or
unbending
reserve
,
as
now
,
when
no
importance
*NL*
could
result
from
the
success
of
his
endeavours
,
and
when
even
the
*NL*
acquaintance
of
those
to
whom
his
attentions
were
addressed
would
draw
*NL*
down
the
ridicule
and
censure
of
the
ladies
both
of
Netherfield
and
*NL*
Rosings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
visitors
stayed
with
them
above
half-an-hour
;
and
when
they
arose
*NL*
to
depart
,
Mr.
Darcy
called
on
his
sister
to
join
him
in
expressing
*NL*
their
wish
of
seeing
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
and
Miss
Bennet
,
to
dinner
*NL*
at
Pemberley
,
before
they
left
the
country
.
Miss
Darcy
,
though
with
a
*NL*
diffidence
which
marked
her
little
in
the
habit
of
giving
invitations
,
*NL*
readily
obeyed
.
Mrs.
Gardiner
looked
at
her
niece
,
desirous
of
knowing
*NL*
how
_
she
_
,
whom
the
invitation
most
concerned
,
felt
disposed
as
to
its
*NL*
acceptance
,
but
Elizabeth
had
turned
away
her
head
.
Presuming
however
,
*NL*
that
this
studied
avoidance
spoke
rather
a
momentary
embarrassment
than
*NL*
any
dislike
of
the
proposal
,
and
seeing
in
her
husband
,
who
was
fond
of
*NL*
society
,
a
perfect
willingness
to
accept
it
,
she
ventured
to
engage
for
*NL*
her
attendance
,
and
the
day
after
the
next
was
fixed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bingley
expressed
great
pleasure
in
the
certainty
of
seeing
Elizabeth
*NL*
again
,
having
still
a
great
deal
to
say
to
her
,
and
many
inquiries
to
*NL*
make
after
all
their
Hertfordshire
friends
.
Elizabeth
,
construing
all
*NL*
this
into
a
wish
of
hearing
her
speak
of
her
sister
,
was
pleased
,
and
on
*NL*
this
account
,
as
well
as
some
others
,
found
herself
,
when
their
*NL*
visitors
left
them
,
capable
of
considering
the
last
half-hour
with
some
*NL*
satisfaction
,
though
while
it
was
passing
,
the
enjoyment
of
it
had
been
*NL*
little
.
Eager
to
be
alone
,
and
fearful
of
inquiries
or
hints
from
her
*NL*
uncle
and
aunt
,
she
stayed
with
them
only
long
enough
to
hear
their
*NL*
favourable
opinion
of
Bingley
,
and
then
hurried
away
to
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
no
reason
to
fear
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
's
curiosity
;
it
was
*NL*
not
their
wish
to
force
her
communication
.
It
was
evident
that
she
was
*NL*
much
better
acquainted
with
Mr.
Darcy
than
they
had
before
any
idea
of
;
*NL*
it
was
evident
that
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
her
.
They
saw
much
to
*NL*
interest
,
but
nothing
to
justify
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
Mr.
Darcy
it
was
now
a
matter
of
anxiety
to
think
well
;
and
,
as
far
*NL*
as
their
acquaintance
reached
,
there
was
no
fault
to
find
.
They
could
*NL*
not
be
untouched
by
his
politeness
;
and
had
they
drawn
his
character
*NL*
from
their
own
feelings
and
his
servant
's
report
,
without
any
reference
*NL*
to
any
other
account
,
the
circle
in
Hertfordshire
to
which
he
was
known
*NL*
would
not
have
recognized
it
for
Mr.
Darcy
.
There
was
now
an
interest
,
*NL*
however
,
in
believing
the
housekeeper
;
and
they
soon
became
sensible
*NL*
that
the
authority
of
a
servant
who
had
known
him
since
he
was
four
*NL*
years
old
,
and
whose
own
manners
indicated
respectability
,
was
not
to
be
*NL*
hastily
rejected
.
Neither
had
anything
occurred
in
the
intelligence
of
*NL*
their
Lambton
friends
that
could
materially
lessen
its
weight
.
They
had
*NL*
nothing
to
accuse
him
of
but
pride
;
pride
he
probably
had
,
and
if
not
,
*NL*
it
would
certainly
be
imputed
by
the
inhabitants
of
a
small
market-town
*NL*
where
the
family
did
not
visit
.
It
was
acknowledged
,
however
,
that
he
*NL*
was
a
liberal
man
,
and
did
much
good
among
the
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
respect
to
Wickham
,
the
travellers
soon
found
that
he
was
not
held
*NL*
there
in
much
estimation
;
for
though
the
chief
of
his
concerns
with
the
*NL*
son
of
his
patron
were
imperfectly
understood
,
it
was
yet
a
well-known
*NL*
fact
that
,
on
his
quitting
Derbyshire
,
he
had
left
many
debts
behind
*NL*
him
,
which
Mr.
Darcy
afterwards
discharged
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Elizabeth
,
her
thoughts
were
at
Pemberley
this
evening
more
than
*NL*
the
last
;
and
the
evening
,
though
as
it
passed
it
seemed
long
,
was
not
*NL*
long
enough
to
determine
her
feelings
towards
_
one
_
in
that
mansion
;
*NL*
and
she
lay
awake
two
whole
hours
endeavouring
to
make
them
out
.
She
*NL*
certainly
did
not
hate
him
.
No
;
hatred
had
vanished
long
ago
,
and
she
*NL*
had
almost
as
long
been
ashamed
of
ever
feeling
a
dislike
against
him
,
*NL*
that
could
be
so
called
.
The
respect
created
by
the
conviction
of
his
*NL*
valuable
qualities
,
though
at
first
unwillingly
admitted
,
had
for
some
*NL*
time
ceased
to
be
repugnant
to
her
feeling
;
and
it
was
now
heightened
*NL*
into
somewhat
of
a
friendlier
nature
,
by
the
testimony
so
highly
in
*NL*
his
favour
,
and
bringing
forward
his
disposition
in
so
amiable
a
light
,
*NL*
which
yesterday
had
produced
.
But
above
all
,
above
respect
and
esteem
,
*NL*
there
was
a
motive
within
her
of
goodwill
which
could
not
be
overlooked
.
*NL*
It
was
gratitude
;
gratitude
,
not
merely
for
having
once
loved
her
,
*NL*
but
for
loving
her
still
well
enough
to
forgive
all
the
petulance
and
*NL*
acrimony
of
her
manner
in
rejecting
him
,
and
all
the
unjust
accusations
*NL*
accompanying
her
rejection
.
He
who
,
she
had
been
persuaded
,
would
avoid
*NL*
her
as
his
greatest
enemy
,
seemed
,
on
this
accidental
meeting
,
most
*NL*
eager
to
preserve
the
acquaintance
,
and
without
any
indelicate
display
*NL*
of
regard
,
or
any
peculiarity
of
manner
,
where
their
two
selves
only
*NL*
were
concerned
,
was
soliciting
the
good
opinion
of
her
friends
,
and
bent
*NL*
on
making
her
known
to
his
sister
.
Such
a
change
in
a
man
of
so
much
*NL*
pride
exciting
not
only
astonishment
but
gratitude
--
for
to
love
,
ardent
*NL*
love
,
it
must
be
attributed
;
and
as
such
its
impression
on
her
was
of
a
*NL*
sort
to
be
encouraged
,
as
by
no
means
unpleasing
,
though
it
could
not
be
*NL*
exactly
defined
.
She
respected
,
she
esteemed
,
she
was
grateful
to
him
,
*NL*
she
felt
a
real
interest
in
his
welfare
;
and
she
only
wanted
to
know
how
*NL*
far
she
wished
that
welfare
to
depend
upon
herself
,
and
how
far
it
would
*NL*
be
for
the
happiness
of
both
that
she
should
employ
the
power
,
which
her
*NL*
fancy
told
her
she
still
possessed
,
of
bringing
on
her
the
renewal
of
*NL*
his
addresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
settled
in
the
evening
between
the
aunt
and
the
niece
,
that
*NL*
such
a
striking
civility
as
Miss
Darcy
's
in
coming
to
see
them
on
the
*NL*
very
day
of
her
arrival
at
Pemberley
,
for
she
had
reached
it
only
to
a
*NL*
late
breakfast
,
ought
to
be
imitated
,
though
it
could
not
be
equalled
,
*NL*
by
some
exertion
of
politeness
on
their
side
;
and
,
consequently
,
that
*NL*
it
would
be
highly
expedient
to
wait
on
her
at
Pemberley
the
following
*NL*
morning
.
They
were
,
therefore
,
to
go
.
Elizabeth
was
pleased
;
though
when
*NL*
she
asked
herself
the
reason
,
she
had
very
little
to
say
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gardiner
left
them
soon
after
breakfast
.
The
fishing
scheme
had
been
*NL*
renewed
the
day
before
,
and
a
positive
engagement
made
of
his
meeting
*NL*
some
of
the
gentlemen
at
Pemberley
before
noon
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
45
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Convinced
as
Elizabeth
now
was
that
Miss
Bingley
's
dislike
of
her
had
*NL*
originated
in
jealousy
,
she
could
not
help
feeling
how
unwelcome
her
*NL*
appearance
at
Pemberley
must
be
to
her
,
and
was
curious
to
know
with
how
*NL*
much
civility
on
that
lady
's
side
the
acquaintance
would
now
be
renewed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
house
,
they
were
shown
through
the
hall
into
the
saloon
,
*NL*
whose
northern
aspect
rendered
it
delightful
for
summer
.
Its
windows
*NL*
opening
to
the
ground
,
admitted
a
most
refreshing
view
of
the
high
woody
*NL*
hills
behind
the
house
,
and
of
the
beautiful
oaks
and
Spanish
chestnuts
*NL*
which
were
scattered
over
the
intermediate
lawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
house
they
were
received
by
Miss
Darcy
,
who
was
sitting
there
*NL*
with
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
,
and
the
lady
with
whom
she
lived
in
*NL*
London
.
Georgiana
's
reception
of
them
was
very
civil
,
but
attended
with
*NL*
all
the
embarrassment
which
,
though
proceeding
from
shyness
and
the
fear
*NL*
of
doing
wrong
,
would
easily
give
to
those
who
felt
themselves
inferior
*NL*
the
belief
of
her
being
proud
and
reserved
.
Mrs.
Gardiner
and
her
niece
,
*NL*
however
,
did
her
justice
,
and
pitied
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
they
were
noticed
only
by
a
curtsey
;
and
,
*NL*
on
their
being
seated
,
a
pause
,
awkward
as
such
pauses
must
always
be
,
*NL*
succeeded
for
a
few
moments
.
It
was
first
broken
by
Mrs.
Annesley
,
a
*NL*
genteel
,
agreeable-looking
woman
,
whose
endeavour
to
introduce
some
kind
*NL*
of
discourse
proved
her
to
be
more
truly
well-bred
than
either
of
the
*NL*
others
;
and
between
her
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
with
occasional
help
from
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
the
conversation
was
carried
on
.
Miss
Darcy
looked
as
if
she
*NL*
wished
for
courage
enough
to
join
in
it
;
and
sometimes
did
venture
a
*NL*
short
sentence
when
there
was
least
danger
of
its
being
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
soon
saw
that
she
was
herself
closely
watched
by
Miss
Bingley
,
*NL*
and
that
she
could
not
speak
a
word
,
especially
to
Miss
Darcy
,
without
*NL*
calling
her
attention
.
This
observation
would
not
have
prevented
her
*NL*
from
trying
to
talk
to
the
latter
,
had
they
not
been
seated
at
an
*NL*
inconvenient
distance
;
but
she
was
not
sorry
to
be
spared
the
necessity
*NL*
of
saying
much
.
Her
own
thoughts
were
employing
her
.
She
expected
every
*NL*
moment
that
some
of
the
gentlemen
would
enter
the
room
.
She
wished
,
she
*NL*
feared
that
the
master
of
the
house
might
be
amongst
them
;
and
whether
*NL*
she
wished
or
feared
it
most
,
she
could
scarcely
determine
.
After
*NL*
sitting
in
this
manner
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
hearing
Miss
*NL*
Bingley
's
voice
,
Elizabeth
was
roused
by
receiving
from
her
a
cold
*NL*
inquiry
after
the
health
of
her
family
.
She
answered
with
equal
*NL*
indifference
and
brevity
,
and
the
other
said
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
variation
which
their
visit
afforded
was
produced
by
the
*NL*
entrance
of
servants
with
cold
meat
,
cake
,
and
a
variety
of
all
the
*NL*
finest
fruits
in
season
;
but
this
did
not
take
place
till
after
many
*NL*
a
significant
look
and
smile
from
Mrs.
Annesley
to
Miss
Darcy
had
been
*NL*
given
,
to
remind
her
of
her
post
.
There
was
now
employment
for
the
whole
*NL*
party
--
for
though
they
could
not
all
talk
,
they
could
all
eat
;
and
the
*NL*
beautiful
pyramids
of
grapes
,
nectarines
,
and
peaches
soon
collected
*NL*
them
round
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
thus
engaged
,
Elizabeth
had
a
fair
opportunity
of
deciding
whether
*NL*
she
most
feared
or
wished
for
the
appearance
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
by
the
*NL*
feelings
which
prevailed
on
his
entering
the
room
;
and
then
,
though
but
*NL*
a
moment
before
she
had
believed
her
wishes
to
predominate
,
she
began
to
*NL*
regret
that
he
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
some
time
with
Mr.
Gardiner
,
who
,
with
two
or
three
other
*NL*
gentlemen
from
the
house
,
was
engaged
by
the
river
,
and
had
left
him
*NL*
only
on
learning
that
the
ladies
of
the
family
intended
a
visit
to
*NL*
Georgiana
that
morning
.
No
sooner
did
he
appear
than
Elizabeth
wisely
*NL*
resolved
to
be
perfectly
easy
and
unembarrassed
;
a
resolution
the
more
*NL*
necessary
to
be
made
,
but
perhaps
not
the
more
easily
kept
,
because
she
*NL*
saw
that
the
suspicions
of
the
whole
party
were
awakened
against
them
,
*NL*
and
that
there
was
scarcely
an
eye
which
did
not
watch
his
behaviour
*NL*
when
he
first
came
into
the
room
.
In
no
countenance
was
attentive
*NL*
curiosity
so
strongly
marked
as
in
Miss
Bingley
's
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
smiles
which
overspread
her
face
whenever
she
spoke
to
one
of
its
*NL*
objects
;
for
jealousy
had
not
yet
made
her
desperate
,
and
her
attentions
*NL*
to
Mr.
Darcy
were
by
no
means
over
.
Miss
Darcy
,
on
her
brother
's
*NL*
entrance
,
exerted
herself
much
more
to
talk
,
and
Elizabeth
saw
that
he
*NL*
was
anxious
for
his
sister
and
herself
to
get
acquainted
,
and
forwarded
*NL*
as
much
as
possible
,
every
attempt
at
conversation
on
either
side
.
Miss
*NL*
Bingley
saw
all
this
likewise
;
and
,
in
the
imprudence
of
anger
,
took
the
*NL*
first
opportunity
of
saying
,
with
sneering
civility
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
Miss
Eliza
,
are
not
the
--
shire
Militia
removed
from
Meryton
?
*NL*
They
must
be
a
great
loss
to
_
your
_
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
Darcy
's
presence
she
dared
not
mention
Wickham
's
name
;
but
Elizabeth
*NL*
instantly
comprehended
that
he
was
uppermost
in
her
thoughts
;
and
the
*NL*
various
recollections
connected
with
him
gave
her
a
moment
's
distress
;
*NL*
but
exerting
herself
vigorously
to
repel
the
ill-natured
attack
,
she
*NL*
presently
answered
the
question
in
a
tolerably
detached
tone
.
While
*NL*
she
spoke
,
an
involuntary
glance
showed
her
Darcy
,
with
a
heightened
*NL*
complexion
,
earnestly
looking
at
her
,
and
his
sister
overcome
with
*NL*
confusion
,
and
unable
to
lift
up
her
eyes
.
Had
Miss
Bingley
known
what
*NL*
pain
she
was
then
giving
her
beloved
friend
,
she
undoubtedly
would
*NL*
have
refrained
from
the
hint
;
but
she
had
merely
intended
to
discompose
*NL*
Elizabeth
by
bringing
forward
the
idea
of
a
man
to
whom
she
believed
*NL*
her
partial
,
to
make
her
betray
a
sensibility
which
might
injure
her
in
*NL*
Darcy
's
opinion
,
and
,
perhaps
,
to
remind
the
latter
of
all
the
follies
*NL*
and
absurdities
by
which
some
part
of
her
family
were
connected
*NL*
with
that
corps
.
Not
a
syllable
had
ever
reached
her
of
Miss
Darcy
's
*NL*
meditated
elopement
.
To
no
creature
had
it
been
revealed
,
where
secrecy
*NL*
was
possible
,
except
to
Elizabeth
;
and
from
all
Bingley
's
connections
*NL*
her
brother
was
particularly
anxious
to
conceal
it
,
from
the
very
*NL*
wish
which
Elizabeth
had
long
ago
attributed
to
him
,
of
their
becoming
*NL*
hereafter
her
own
.
He
had
certainly
formed
such
a
plan
,
and
without
*NL*
meaning
that
it
should
affect
his
endeavour
to
separate
him
from
Miss
*NL*
Bennet
,
it
is
probable
that
it
might
add
something
to
his
lively
concern
*NL*
for
the
welfare
of
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
collected
behaviour
,
however
,
soon
quieted
his
emotion
;
and
*NL*
as
Miss
Bingley
,
vexed
and
disappointed
,
dared
not
approach
nearer
to
*NL*
Wickham
,
Georgiana
also
recovered
in
time
,
though
not
enough
to
be
able
*NL*
to
speak
any
more
.
Her
brother
,
whose
eye
she
feared
to
meet
,
scarcely
*NL*
recollected
her
interest
in
the
affair
,
and
the
very
circumstance
which
*NL*
had
been
designed
to
turn
his
thoughts
from
Elizabeth
seemed
to
have
*NL*
fixed
them
on
her
more
and
more
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
visit
did
not
continue
long
after
the
question
and
answer
above
*NL*
mentioned
;
and
while
Mr.
Darcy
was
attending
them
to
their
carriage
Miss
*NL*
Bingley
was
venting
her
feelings
in
criticisms
on
Elizabeth
's
person
,
*NL*
behaviour
,
and
dress
.
But
Georgiana
would
not
join
her
.
Her
brother
's
*NL*
recommendation
was
enough
to
ensure
her
favour
;
his
judgement
could
not
*NL*
err
.
And
he
had
spoken
in
such
terms
of
Elizabeth
as
to
leave
Georgiana
*NL*
without
the
power
of
finding
her
otherwise
than
lovely
and
amiable
.
When
*NL*
Darcy
returned
to
the
saloon
,
Miss
Bingley
could
not
help
repeating
to
*NL*
him
some
part
of
what
she
had
been
saying
to
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
ill
Miss
Eliza
Bennet
looks
this
morning
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
''
she
*NL*
cried
;
``
I
never
in
my
life
saw
anyone
so
much
altered
as
she
is
since
*NL*
the
winter
.
She
is
grown
so
brown
and
coarse
!
Louisa
and
I
were
agreeing
*NL*
that
we
should
not
have
known
her
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
little
Mr.
Darcy
might
have
liked
such
an
address
,
he
contented
*NL*
himself
with
coolly
replying
that
he
perceived
no
other
alteration
than
*NL*
her
being
rather
tanned
,
no
miraculous
consequence
of
travelling
in
the
*NL*
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
own
part
,
''
she
rejoined
,
``
I
must
confess
that
I
never
could
*NL*
see
any
beauty
in
her
.
Her
face
is
too
thin
;
her
complexion
has
no
*NL*
brilliancy
;
and
her
features
are
not
at
all
handsome
.
Her
nose
*NL*
wants
character
--
there
is
nothing
marked
in
its
lines
.
Her
teeth
are
*NL*
tolerable
,
but
not
out
of
the
common
way
;
and
as
for
her
eyes
,
*NL*
which
have
sometimes
been
called
so
fine
,
I
could
never
see
anything
*NL*
extraordinary
in
them
.
They
have
a
sharp
,
shrewish
look
,
which
I
do
*NL*
not
like
at
all
;
and
in
her
air
altogether
there
is
a
self-sufficiency
*NL*
without
fashion
,
which
is
intolerable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Persuaded
as
Miss
Bingley
was
that
Darcy
admired
Elizabeth
,
this
was
not
*NL*
the
best
method
of
recommending
herself
;
but
angry
people
are
not
always
*NL*
wise
;
and
in
seeing
him
at
last
look
somewhat
nettled
,
she
had
all
the
*NL*
success
she
expected
.
He
was
resolutely
silent
,
however
,
and
,
from
a
*NL*
determination
of
making
him
speak
,
she
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
,
when
we
first
knew
her
in
Hertfordshire
,
how
amazed
we
all
*NL*
were
to
find
that
she
was
a
reputed
beauty
;
and
I
particularly
recollect
*NL*
your
saying
one
night
,
after
they
had
been
dining
at
Netherfield
,
'
_
She
_
*NL*
a
beauty
!
--
I
should
as
soon
call
her
mother
a
wit
.
'
But
afterwards
she
*NL*
seemed
to
improve
on
you
,
and
I
believe
you
thought
her
rather
pretty
at
*NL*
one
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Darcy
,
who
could
contain
himself
no
longer
,
``
but
_
that
_
*NL*
was
only
when
I
first
saw
her
,
for
it
is
many
months
since
I
have
*NL*
considered
her
as
one
of
the
handsomest
women
of
my
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
went
away
,
and
Miss
Bingley
was
left
to
all
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
having
forced
him
to
say
what
gave
no
one
any
pain
but
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
and
Elizabeth
talked
of
all
that
had
occurred
during
their
*NL*
visit
,
as
they
returned
,
except
what
had
particularly
interested
them
*NL*
both
.
The
look
and
behaviour
of
everybody
they
had
seen
were
discussed
,
*NL*
except
of
the
person
who
had
mostly
engaged
their
attention
.
They
talked
*NL*
of
his
sister
,
his
friends
,
his
house
,
his
fruit
--
of
everything
but
*NL*
himself
;
yet
Elizabeth
was
longing
to
know
what
Mrs.
Gardiner
thought
of
*NL*
him
,
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
would
have
been
highly
gratified
by
her
niece
's
*NL*
beginning
the
subject
.

Chapter
46
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
been
a
good
deal
disappointed
in
not
finding
a
letter
from
*NL*
Jane
on
their
first
arrival
at
Lambton
;
and
this
disappointment
had
been
*NL*
renewed
on
each
of
the
mornings
that
had
now
been
spent
there
;
but
*NL*
on
the
third
her
repining
was
over
,
and
her
sister
justified
,
by
the
*NL*
receipt
of
two
letters
from
her
at
once
,
on
one
of
which
was
marked
that
*NL*
it
had
been
missent
elsewhere
.
Elizabeth
was
not
surprised
at
it
,
as
*NL*
Jane
had
written
the
direction
remarkably
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
just
been
preparing
to
walk
as
the
letters
came
in
;
and
*NL*
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
leaving
her
to
enjoy
them
in
quiet
,
set
off
by
*NL*
themselves
.
The
one
missent
must
first
be
attended
to
;
it
had
been
*NL*
written
five
days
ago
.
The
beginning
contained
an
account
of
all
their
*NL*
little
parties
and
engagements
,
with
such
news
as
the
country
afforded
;
*NL*
but
the
latter
half
,
which
was
dated
a
day
later
,
and
written
in
evident
*NL*
agitation
,
gave
more
important
intelligence
.
It
was
to
this
effect
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
writing
the
above
,
dearest
Lizzy
,
something
has
occurred
of
a
*NL*
most
unexpected
and
serious
nature
;
but
I
am
afraid
of
alarming
you
--
be
*NL*
assured
that
we
are
all
well
.
What
I
have
to
say
relates
to
poor
Lydia
.
*NL*
An
express
came
at
twelve
last
night
,
just
as
we
were
all
gone
to
bed
,
*NL*
from
Colonel
Forster
,
to
inform
us
that
she
was
gone
off
to
Scotland
*NL*
with
one
of
his
officers
;
to
own
the
truth
,
with
Wickham
!
Imagine
our
*NL*
surprise
.
To
Kitty
,
however
,
it
does
not
seem
so
wholly
unexpected
.
I
am
*NL*
very
,
very
sorry
.
So
imprudent
a
match
on
both
sides
!
But
I
am
willing
*NL*
to
hope
the
best
,
and
that
his
character
has
been
misunderstood
.
*NL*
Thoughtless
and
indiscreet
I
can
easily
believe
him
,
but
this
step
*NL*
-LRB-
and
let
us
rejoice
over
it
-RRB-
marks
nothing
bad
at
heart
.
His
choice
is
*NL*
disinterested
at
least
,
for
he
must
know
my
father
can
give
her
nothing
.
*NL*
Our
poor
mother
is
sadly
grieved
.
My
father
bears
it
better
.
How
*NL*
thankful
am
I
that
we
never
let
them
know
what
has
been
said
against
*NL*
him
;
we
must
forget
it
ourselves
.
They
were
off
Saturday
night
about
*NL*
twelve
,
as
is
conjectured
,
but
were
not
missed
till
yesterday
morning
at
*NL*
eight
.
The
express
was
sent
off
directly
.
My
dear
Lizzy
,
they
must
have
*NL*
passed
within
ten
miles
of
us
.
Colonel
Forster
gives
us
reason
to
expect
*NL*
him
here
soon
.
Lydia
left
a
few
lines
for
his
wife
,
informing
her
of
*NL*
their
intention
.
I
must
conclude
,
for
I
can
not
be
long
from
my
poor
*NL*
mother
.
I
am
afraid
you
will
not
be
able
to
make
it
out
,
but
I
hardly
*NL*
know
what
I
have
written
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
allowing
herself
time
for
consideration
,
and
scarcely
knowing
*NL*
what
she
felt
,
Elizabeth
on
finishing
this
letter
instantly
seized
the
*NL*
other
,
and
opening
it
with
the
utmost
impatience
,
read
as
follows
:
it
*NL*
had
been
written
a
day
later
than
the
conclusion
of
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
this
time
,
my
dearest
sister
,
you
have
received
my
hurried
letter
;
I
*NL*
wish
this
may
be
more
intelligible
,
but
though
not
confined
for
time
,
my
*NL*
head
is
so
bewildered
that
I
can
not
answer
for
being
coherent
.
Dearest
*NL*
Lizzy
,
I
hardly
know
what
I
would
write
,
but
I
have
bad
news
for
you
,
*NL*
and
it
can
not
be
delayed
.
Imprudent
as
the
marriage
between
Mr.
Wickham
*NL*
and
our
poor
Lydia
would
be
,
we
are
now
anxious
to
be
assured
it
has
*NL*
taken
place
,
for
there
is
but
too
much
reason
to
fear
they
are
not
gone
*NL*
to
Scotland
.
Colonel
Forster
came
yesterday
,
having
left
Brighton
the
*NL*
day
before
,
not
many
hours
after
the
express
.
Though
Lydia
's
short
*NL*
letter
to
Mrs.
F.
gave
them
to
understand
that
they
were
going
to
Gretna
*NL*
Green
,
something
was
dropped
by
Denny
expressing
his
belief
that
W.
*NL*
never
intended
to
go
there
,
or
to
marry
Lydia
at
all
,
which
was
*NL*
repeated
to
Colonel
F.
,
who
,
instantly
taking
the
alarm
,
set
off
from
B.
*NL*
intending
to
trace
their
route
.
He
did
trace
them
easily
to
Clapham
,
*NL*
but
no
further
;
for
on
entering
that
place
,
they
removed
into
a
hackney
*NL*
coach
,
and
dismissed
the
chaise
that
brought
them
from
Epsom
.
All
that
*NL*
is
known
after
this
is
,
that
they
were
seen
to
continue
the
London
road
.
*NL*
I
know
not
what
to
think
.
After
making
every
possible
inquiry
on
that
*NL*
side
London
,
Colonel
F.
came
on
into
Hertfordshire
,
anxiously
renewing
*NL*
them
at
all
the
turnpikes
,
and
at
the
inns
in
Barnet
and
Hatfield
,
but
*NL*
without
any
success
--
no
such
people
had
been
seen
to
pass
through
.
With
*NL*
the
kindest
concern
he
came
on
to
Longbourn
,
and
broke
his
apprehensions
*NL*
to
us
in
a
manner
most
creditable
to
his
heart
.
I
am
sincerely
grieved
*NL*
for
him
and
Mrs.
F.
,
but
no
one
can
throw
any
blame
on
them
.
Our
*NL*
distress
,
my
dear
Lizzy
,
is
very
great
.
My
father
and
mother
believe
the
*NL*
worst
,
but
I
can
not
think
so
ill
of
him
.
Many
circumstances
might
make
*NL*
it
more
eligible
for
them
to
be
married
privately
in
town
than
to
pursue
*NL*
their
first
plan
;
and
even
if
_
he
_
could
form
such
a
design
against
a
*NL*
young
woman
of
Lydia
's
connections
,
which
is
not
likely
,
can
I
suppose
*NL*
her
so
lost
to
everything
?
Impossible
!
I
grieve
to
find
,
however
,
that
*NL*
Colonel
F.
is
not
disposed
to
depend
upon
their
marriage
;
he
shook
his
*NL*
head
when
I
expressed
my
hopes
,
and
said
he
feared
W.
was
not
a
man
to
*NL*
be
trusted
.
My
poor
mother
is
really
ill
,
and
keeps
her
room
.
Could
she
*NL*
exert
herself
,
it
would
be
better
;
but
this
is
not
to
be
expected
.
And
*NL*
as
to
my
father
,
I
never
in
my
life
saw
him
so
affected
.
Poor
Kitty
has
*NL*
anger
for
having
concealed
their
attachment
;
but
as
it
was
a
matter
of
*NL*
confidence
,
one
can
not
wonder
.
I
am
truly
glad
,
dearest
Lizzy
,
that
you
*NL*
have
been
spared
something
of
these
distressing
scenes
;
but
now
,
as
the
*NL*
first
shock
is
over
,
shall
I
own
that
I
long
for
your
return
?
I
am
not
*NL*
so
selfish
,
however
,
as
to
press
for
it
,
if
inconvenient
.
Adieu
!
I
*NL*
take
up
my
pen
again
to
do
what
I
have
just
told
you
I
would
not
;
but
*NL*
circumstances
are
such
that
I
can
not
help
earnestly
begging
you
all
to
*NL*
come
here
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
know
my
dear
uncle
and
aunt
so
well
,
*NL*
that
I
am
not
afraid
of
requesting
it
,
though
I
have
still
something
*NL*
more
to
ask
of
the
former
.
My
father
is
going
to
London
with
Colonel
*NL*
Forster
instantly
,
to
try
to
discover
her
.
What
he
means
to
do
I
am
sure
*NL*
I
know
not
;
but
his
excessive
distress
will
not
allow
him
to
pursue
any
*NL*
measure
in
the
best
and
safest
way
,
and
Colonel
Forster
is
obliged
to
*NL*
be
at
Brighton
again
to-morrow
evening
.
In
such
an
exigence
,
my
*NL*
uncle
's
advice
and
assistance
would
be
everything
in
the
world
;
he
will
*NL*
immediately
comprehend
what
I
must
feel
,
and
I
rely
upon
his
goodness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
where
,
where
is
my
uncle
?
''
cried
Elizabeth
,
darting
from
her
seat
*NL*
as
she
finished
the
letter
,
in
eagerness
to
follow
him
,
without
losing
*NL*
a
moment
of
the
time
so
precious
;
but
as
she
reached
the
door
it
was
*NL*
opened
by
a
servant
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
appeared
.
Her
pale
face
and
impetuous
*NL*
manner
made
him
start
,
and
before
he
could
recover
himself
to
speak
,
*NL*
she
,
in
whose
mind
every
idea
was
superseded
by
Lydia
's
situation
,
*NL*
hastily
exclaimed
,
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
but
I
must
leave
you
.
I
must
find
*NL*
Mr.
Gardiner
this
moment
,
on
business
that
can
not
be
delayed
;
I
have
not
*NL*
an
instant
to
lose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
what
is
the
matter
?
''
cried
he
,
with
more
feeling
than
*NL*
politeness
;
then
recollecting
himself
,
``
I
will
not
detain
you
a
minute
;
*NL*
but
let
me
,
or
let
the
servant
go
after
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
.
You
are
*NL*
not
well
enough
;
you
can
not
go
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
hesitated
,
but
her
knees
trembled
under
her
and
she
felt
how
*NL*
little
would
be
gained
by
her
attempting
to
pursue
them
.
Calling
back
*NL*
the
servant
,
therefore
,
she
commissioned
him
,
though
in
so
breathless
*NL*
an
accent
as
made
her
almost
unintelligible
,
to
fetch
his
master
and
*NL*
mistress
home
instantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
quitting
the
room
she
sat
down
,
unable
to
support
herself
,
and
*NL*
looking
so
miserably
ill
,
that
it
was
impossible
for
Darcy
to
leave
her
,
*NL*
or
to
refrain
from
saying
,
in
a
tone
of
gentleness
and
commiseration
,
*NL*
``
Let
me
call
your
maid
.
Is
there
nothing
you
could
take
to
give
you
*NL*
present
relief
?
A
glass
of
wine
;
shall
I
get
you
one
?
You
are
very
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
thank
you
,
''
she
replied
,
endeavouring
to
recover
herself
.
``
There
*NL*
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
.
I
am
quite
well
;
I
am
only
distressed
by
*NL*
some
dreadful
news
which
I
have
just
received
from
Longbourn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
burst
into
tears
as
she
alluded
to
it
,
and
for
a
few
minutes
could
*NL*
not
speak
another
word
.
Darcy
,
in
wretched
suspense
,
could
only
say
*NL*
something
indistinctly
of
his
concern
,
and
observe
her
in
compassionate
*NL*
silence
.
At
length
she
spoke
again
.
``
I
have
just
had
a
letter
from
Jane
,
*NL*
with
such
dreadful
news
.
It
can
not
be
concealed
from
anyone
.
My
younger
*NL*
sister
has
left
all
her
friends
--
has
eloped
;
has
thrown
herself
into
*NL*
the
power
of
--
of
Mr.
Wickham
.
They
are
gone
off
together
from
Brighton
.
*NL*
_
You
_
know
him
too
well
to
doubt
the
rest
.
She
has
no
money
,
no
*NL*
connections
,
nothing
that
can
tempt
him
to
--
she
is
lost
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darcy
was
fixed
in
astonishment
.
``
When
I
consider
,
''
she
added
in
a
yet
*NL*
more
agitated
voice
,
``
that
I
might
have
prevented
it
!
I
,
who
knew
what
*NL*
he
was
.
Had
I
but
explained
some
part
of
it
only
--
some
part
of
what
I
*NL*
learnt
,
to
my
own
family
!
Had
his
character
been
known
,
this
could
not
*NL*
have
happened
.
But
it
is
all
--
all
too
late
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
grieved
indeed
,
''
cried
Darcy
;
``
grieved
--
shocked
.
But
is
it
*NL*
certain
--
absolutely
certain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
They
left
Brighton
together
on
Sunday
night
,
and
were
traced
*NL*
almost
to
London
,
but
not
beyond
;
they
are
certainly
not
gone
to
*NL*
Scotland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
has
been
done
,
what
has
been
attempted
,
to
recover
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
is
gone
to
London
,
and
Jane
has
written
to
beg
my
uncle
's
*NL*
immediate
assistance
;
and
we
shall
be
off
,
I
hope
,
in
half-an-hour
.
But
*NL*
nothing
can
be
done
--
I
know
very
well
that
nothing
can
be
done
.
How
is
*NL*
such
a
man
to
be
worked
on
?
How
are
they
even
to
be
discovered
?
I
have
*NL*
not
the
smallest
hope
.
It
is
every
way
horrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darcy
shook
his
head
in
silent
acquiescence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
_
my
_
eyes
were
opened
to
his
real
character
--
Oh
!
had
I
known
what
*NL*
I
ought
,
what
I
dared
to
do
!
But
I
knew
not
--
I
was
afraid
of
doing
too
*NL*
much
.
Wretched
,
wretched
mistake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darcy
made
no
answer
.
He
seemed
scarcely
to
hear
her
,
and
was
walking
*NL*
up
and
down
the
room
in
earnest
meditation
,
his
brow
contracted
,
his
air
*NL*
gloomy
.
Elizabeth
soon
observed
,
and
instantly
understood
it
.
Her
*NL*
power
was
sinking
;
everything
_
must
_
sink
under
such
a
proof
of
family
*NL*
weakness
,
such
an
assurance
of
the
deepest
disgrace
.
She
could
neither
*NL*
wonder
nor
condemn
,
but
the
belief
of
his
self-conquest
brought
nothing
*NL*
consolatory
to
her
bosom
,
afforded
no
palliation
of
her
distress
.
It
*NL*
was
,
on
the
contrary
,
exactly
calculated
to
make
her
understand
her
own
*NL*
wishes
;
and
never
had
she
so
honestly
felt
that
she
could
have
loved
*NL*
him
,
as
now
,
when
all
love
must
be
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
self
,
though
it
would
intrude
,
could
not
engross
her
.
Lydia
--
the
*NL*
humiliation
,
the
misery
she
was
bringing
on
them
all
,
soon
swallowed
*NL*
up
every
private
care
;
and
covering
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
,
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
soon
lost
to
everything
else
;
and
,
after
a
pause
of
*NL*
several
minutes
,
was
only
recalled
to
a
sense
of
her
situation
by
*NL*
the
voice
of
her
companion
,
who
,
in
a
manner
which
,
though
it
spoke
*NL*
compassion
,
spoke
likewise
restraint
,
said
,
``
I
am
afraid
you
have
been
*NL*
long
desiring
my
absence
,
nor
have
I
anything
to
plead
in
excuse
of
my
*NL*
stay
,
but
real
,
though
unavailing
concern
.
Would
to
Heaven
that
anything
*NL*
could
be
either
said
or
done
on
my
part
that
might
offer
consolation
to
*NL*
such
distress
!
But
I
will
not
torment
you
with
vain
wishes
,
which
may
*NL*
seem
purposely
to
ask
for
your
thanks
.
This
unfortunate
affair
will
,
I
*NL*
fear
,
prevent
my
sister
's
having
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
Pemberley
*NL*
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
.
Be
so
kind
as
to
apologise
for
us
to
Miss
Darcy
.
Say
that
*NL*
urgent
business
calls
us
home
immediately
.
Conceal
the
unhappy
truth
as
*NL*
long
as
it
is
possible
,
I
know
it
can
not
be
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
readily
assured
her
of
his
secrecy
;
again
expressed
his
sorrow
for
*NL*
her
distress
,
wished
it
a
happier
conclusion
than
there
was
at
present
*NL*
reason
to
hope
,
and
leaving
his
compliments
for
her
relations
,
with
only
*NL*
one
serious
,
parting
look
,
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
quitted
the
room
,
Elizabeth
felt
how
improbable
it
was
that
they
*NL*
should
ever
see
each
other
again
on
such
terms
of
cordiality
as
*NL*
had
marked
their
several
meetings
in
Derbyshire
;
and
as
she
threw
a
*NL*
retrospective
glance
over
the
whole
of
their
acquaintance
,
so
full
*NL*
of
contradictions
and
varieties
,
sighed
at
the
perverseness
of
those
*NL*
feelings
which
would
now
have
promoted
its
continuance
,
and
would
*NL*
formerly
have
rejoiced
in
its
termination
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
gratitude
and
esteem
are
good
foundations
of
affection
,
Elizabeth
's
*NL*
change
of
sentiment
will
be
neither
improbable
nor
faulty
.
But
if
*NL*
otherwise
--
if
regard
springing
from
such
sources
is
unreasonable
or
*NL*
unnatural
,
in
comparison
of
what
is
so
often
described
as
arising
on
*NL*
a
first
interview
with
its
object
,
and
even
before
two
words
have
been
*NL*
exchanged
,
nothing
can
be
said
in
her
defence
,
except
that
she
had
given
*NL*
somewhat
of
a
trial
to
the
latter
method
in
her
partiality
for
Wickham
,
*NL*
and
that
its
ill
success
might
,
perhaps
,
authorise
her
to
seek
the
other
*NL*
less
interesting
mode
of
attachment
.
Be
that
as
it
may
,
she
saw
him
*NL*
go
with
regret
;
and
in
this
early
example
of
what
Lydia
's
infamy
must
*NL*
produce
,
found
additional
anguish
as
she
reflected
on
that
wretched
*NL*
business
.
Never
,
since
reading
Jane
's
second
letter
,
had
she
entertained
*NL*
a
hope
of
Wickham
's
meaning
to
marry
her
.
No
one
but
Jane
,
she
thought
,
*NL*
could
flatter
herself
with
such
an
expectation
.
Surprise
was
the
least
*NL*
of
her
feelings
on
this
development
.
While
the
contents
of
the
first
*NL*
letter
remained
in
her
mind
,
she
was
all
surprise
--
all
astonishment
that
*NL*
Wickham
should
marry
a
girl
whom
it
was
impossible
he
could
marry
*NL*
for
money
;
and
how
Lydia
could
ever
have
attached
him
had
appeared
*NL*
incomprehensible
.
But
now
it
was
all
too
natural
.
For
such
an
attachment
*NL*
as
this
she
might
have
sufficient
charms
;
and
though
she
did
not
suppose
*NL*
Lydia
to
be
deliberately
engaging
in
an
elopement
without
the
intention
*NL*
of
marriage
,
she
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
neither
her
virtue
*NL*
nor
her
understanding
would
preserve
her
from
falling
an
easy
prey
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
never
perceived
,
while
the
regiment
was
in
Hertfordshire
,
that
*NL*
Lydia
had
any
partiality
for
him
;
but
she
was
convinced
that
Lydia
*NL*
wanted
only
encouragement
to
attach
herself
to
anybody
.
Sometimes
one
*NL*
officer
,
sometimes
another
,
had
been
her
favourite
,
as
their
attentions
*NL*
raised
them
in
her
opinion
.
Her
affections
had
continually
been
*NL*
fluctuating
but
never
without
an
object
.
The
mischief
of
neglect
and
*NL*
mistaken
indulgence
towards
such
a
girl
--
oh
!
how
acutely
did
she
now
*NL*
feel
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
wild
to
be
at
home
--
to
hear
,
to
see
,
to
be
upon
the
spot
to
*NL*
share
with
Jane
in
the
cares
that
must
now
fall
wholly
upon
her
,
in
a
*NL*
family
so
deranged
,
a
father
absent
,
a
mother
incapable
of
exertion
,
and
*NL*
requiring
constant
attendance
;
and
though
almost
persuaded
that
nothing
*NL*
could
be
done
for
Lydia
,
her
uncle
's
interference
seemed
of
the
utmost
*NL*
importance
,
and
till
he
entered
the
room
her
impatience
was
severe
.
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
had
hurried
back
in
alarm
,
supposing
by
the
servant
's
*NL*
account
that
their
niece
was
taken
suddenly
ill
;
but
satisfying
them
*NL*
instantly
on
that
head
,
she
eagerly
communicated
the
cause
of
their
*NL*
summons
,
reading
the
two
letters
aloud
,
and
dwelling
on
the
postscript
*NL*
of
the
last
with
trembling
energy
.
--
Though
Lydia
had
never
been
a
*NL*
favourite
with
them
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
could
not
but
be
deeply
*NL*
afflicted
.
Not
Lydia
only
,
but
all
were
concerned
in
it
;
and
after
the
*NL*
first
exclamations
of
surprise
and
horror
,
Mr.
Gardiner
promised
every
*NL*
assistance
in
his
power
.
Elizabeth
,
though
expecting
no
less
,
thanked
*NL*
him
with
tears
of
gratitude
;
and
all
three
being
actuated
by
one
spirit
,
*NL*
everything
relating
to
their
journey
was
speedily
settled
.
They
were
to
*NL*
be
off
as
soon
as
possible
.
``
But
what
is
to
be
done
about
Pemberley
?
''
*NL*
cried
Mrs.
Gardiner
.
``
John
told
us
Mr.
Darcy
was
here
when
you
sent
for
*NL*
us
;
was
it
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
I
told
him
we
should
not
be
able
to
keep
our
engagement
.
*NL*
_
That
_
is
all
settled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
all
settled
?
''
repeated
the
other
,
as
she
ran
into
her
room
to
*NL*
prepare
.
``
And
are
they
upon
such
terms
as
for
her
to
disclose
the
real
*NL*
truth
?
Oh
,
that
I
knew
how
it
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
wishes
were
vain
,
or
at
least
could
only
serve
to
amuse
her
in
the
*NL*
hurry
and
confusion
of
the
following
hour
.
Had
Elizabeth
been
at
leisure
*NL*
to
be
idle
,
she
would
have
remained
certain
that
all
employment
was
*NL*
impossible
to
one
so
wretched
as
herself
;
but
she
had
her
share
of
*NL*
business
as
well
as
her
aunt
,
and
amongst
the
rest
there
were
notes
to
*NL*
be
written
to
all
their
friends
at
Lambton
,
with
false
excuses
for
their
*NL*
sudden
departure
.
An
hour
,
however
,
saw
the
whole
completed
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Gardiner
meanwhile
having
settled
his
account
at
the
inn
,
nothing
*NL*
remained
to
be
done
but
to
go
;
and
Elizabeth
,
after
all
the
misery
of
*NL*
the
morning
,
found
herself
,
in
a
shorter
space
of
time
than
she
could
*NL*
have
supposed
,
seated
in
the
carriage
,
and
on
the
road
to
Longbourn
.

``
I
have
been
thinking
it
over
again
,
Elizabeth
,
''
said
her
uncle
,
as
they
*NL*
drove
from
the
town
;
``
and
really
,
upon
serious
consideration
,
I
am
much
*NL*
more
inclined
than
I
was
to
judge
as
your
eldest
sister
does
on
the
*NL*
matter
.
It
appears
to
me
so
very
unlikely
that
any
young
man
should
*NL*
form
such
a
design
against
a
girl
who
is
by
no
means
unprotected
or
*NL*
friendless
,
and
who
was
actually
staying
in
his
colonel
's
family
,
that
I
*NL*
am
strongly
inclined
to
hope
the
best
.
Could
he
expect
that
her
friends
*NL*
would
not
step
forward
?
Could
he
expect
to
be
noticed
again
by
the
*NL*
regiment
,
after
such
an
affront
to
Colonel
Forster
?
His
temptation
is
*NL*
not
adequate
to
the
risk
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
think
so
?
''
cried
Elizabeth
,
brightening
up
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
said
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
``
I
begin
to
be
of
your
uncle
's
*NL*
opinion
.
It
is
really
too
great
a
violation
of
decency
,
honour
,
and
*NL*
interest
,
for
him
to
be
guilty
of
.
I
can
not
think
so
very
ill
of
*NL*
Wickham
.
Can
you
yourself
,
Lizzy
,
so
wholly
give
him
up
,
as
to
believe
*NL*
him
capable
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
,
perhaps
,
of
neglecting
his
own
interest
;
but
of
every
other
*NL*
neglect
I
can
believe
him
capable
.
If
,
indeed
,
it
should
be
so
!
But
I
*NL*
dare
not
hope
it
.
Why
should
they
not
go
on
to
Scotland
if
that
had
been
*NL*
the
case
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
''
replied
Mr.
Gardiner
,
``
there
is
no
absolute
proof
*NL*
that
they
are
not
gone
to
Scotland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
but
their
removing
from
the
chaise
into
a
hackney
coach
is
such
*NL*
a
presumption
!
And
,
besides
,
no
traces
of
them
were
to
be
found
on
the
*NL*
Barnet
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
--
supposing
them
to
be
in
London
.
They
may
be
there
,
though
*NL*
for
the
purpose
of
concealment
,
for
no
more
exceptional
purpose
.
It
is
*NL*
not
likely
that
money
should
be
very
abundant
on
either
side
;
and
it
*NL*
might
strike
them
that
they
could
be
more
economically
,
though
less
*NL*
expeditiously
,
married
in
London
than
in
Scotland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
all
this
secrecy
?
Why
any
fear
of
detection
?
Why
must
their
*NL*
marriage
be
private
?
Oh
,
no
,
no
--
this
is
not
likely
.
His
most
particular
*NL*
friend
,
you
see
by
Jane
's
account
,
was
persuaded
of
his
never
intending
*NL*
to
marry
her
.
Wickham
will
never
marry
a
woman
without
some
money
.
He
*NL*
can
not
afford
it
.
And
what
claims
has
Lydia
--
what
attraction
has
she
*NL*
beyond
youth
,
health
,
and
good
humour
that
could
make
him
,
for
her
sake
,
*NL*
forego
every
chance
of
benefiting
himself
by
marrying
well
?
As
to
what
*NL*
restraint
the
apprehensions
of
disgrace
in
the
corps
might
throw
on
a
*NL*
dishonourable
elopement
with
her
,
I
am
not
able
to
judge
;
for
I
know
*NL*
nothing
of
the
effects
that
such
a
step
might
produce
.
But
as
to
your
*NL*
other
objection
,
I
am
afraid
it
will
hardly
hold
good
.
Lydia
has
*NL*
no
brothers
to
step
forward
;
and
he
might
imagine
,
from
my
father
's
*NL*
behaviour
,
from
his
indolence
and
the
little
attention
he
has
ever
*NL*
seemed
to
give
to
what
was
going
forward
in
his
family
,
that
_
he
_
would
*NL*
do
as
little
,
and
think
as
little
about
it
,
as
any
father
could
do
,
in
*NL*
such
a
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
can
you
think
that
Lydia
is
so
lost
to
everything
but
love
of
him
*NL*
as
to
consent
to
live
with
him
on
any
terms
other
than
marriage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
seem
,
and
it
is
most
shocking
indeed
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
,
with
*NL*
tears
in
her
eyes
,
``
that
a
sister
's
sense
of
decency
and
virtue
in
such
*NL*
a
point
should
admit
of
doubt
.
But
,
really
,
I
know
not
what
to
say
.
*NL*
Perhaps
I
am
not
doing
her
justice
.
But
she
is
very
young
;
she
has
never
*NL*
been
taught
to
think
on
serious
subjects
;
and
for
the
last
half-year
,
*NL*
nay
,
for
a
twelvemonth
--
she
has
been
given
up
to
nothing
but
amusement
*NL*
and
vanity
.
She
has
been
allowed
to
dispose
of
her
time
in
the
most
idle
*NL*
and
frivolous
manner
,
and
to
adopt
any
opinions
that
came
in
her
way
.
*NL*
Since
the
--
shire
were
first
quartered
in
Meryton
,
nothing
but
love
,
*NL*
flirtation
,
and
officers
have
been
in
her
head
.
She
has
been
doing
*NL*
everything
in
her
power
by
thinking
and
talking
on
the
subject
,
to
give
*NL*
greater
--
what
shall
I
call
it
?
susceptibility
to
her
feelings
;
which
are
*NL*
naturally
lively
enough
.
And
we
all
know
that
Wickham
has
every
charm
of
*NL*
person
and
address
that
can
captivate
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
see
that
Jane
,
''
said
her
aunt
,
``
does
not
think
so
very
ill
of
*NL*
Wickham
as
to
believe
him
capable
of
the
attempt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
whom
does
Jane
ever
think
ill
?
And
who
is
there
,
whatever
might
be
*NL*
their
former
conduct
,
that
she
would
think
capable
of
such
an
attempt
,
*NL*
till
it
were
proved
against
them
?
But
Jane
knows
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
what
*NL*
Wickham
really
is
.
We
both
know
that
he
has
been
profligate
in
every
*NL*
sense
of
the
word
;
that
he
has
neither
integrity
nor
honour
;
that
he
is
*NL*
as
false
and
deceitful
as
he
is
insinuating
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
really
know
all
this
?
''
cried
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
whose
curiosity
*NL*
as
to
the
mode
of
her
intelligence
was
all
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
indeed
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
,
colouring
.
``
I
told
you
,
the
other
day
,
*NL*
of
his
infamous
behaviour
to
Mr.
Darcy
;
and
you
yourself
,
when
last
at
*NL*
Longbourn
,
heard
in
what
manner
he
spoke
of
the
man
who
had
behaved
*NL*
with
such
forbearance
and
liberality
towards
him
.
And
there
are
other
*NL*
circumstances
which
I
am
not
at
liberty
--
which
it
is
not
worth
while
to
*NL*
relate
;
but
his
lies
about
the
whole
Pemberley
family
are
endless
.
From
*NL*
what
he
said
of
Miss
Darcy
I
was
thoroughly
prepared
to
see
a
proud
,
*NL*
reserved
,
disagreeable
girl
.
Yet
he
knew
to
the
contrary
himself
.
He
*NL*
must
know
that
she
was
as
amiable
and
unpretending
as
we
have
found
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
does
Lydia
know
nothing
of
this
?
can
she
be
ignorant
of
what
you
*NL*
and
Jane
seem
so
well
to
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
--
that
,
that
is
the
worst
of
all
.
Till
I
was
in
Kent
,
and
saw
*NL*
so
much
both
of
Mr.
Darcy
and
his
relation
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
I
was
*NL*
ignorant
of
the
truth
myself
.
And
when
I
returned
home
,
the
--
shire
*NL*
was
to
leave
Meryton
in
a
week
or
fortnight
's
time
.
As
that
was
the
*NL*
case
,
neither
Jane
,
to
whom
I
related
the
whole
,
nor
I
,
thought
it
*NL*
necessary
to
make
our
knowledge
public
;
for
of
what
use
could
*NL*
it
apparently
be
to
any
one
,
that
the
good
opinion
which
all
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
had
of
him
should
then
be
overthrown
?
And
even
when
it
was
*NL*
settled
that
Lydia
should
go
with
Mrs.
Forster
,
the
necessity
of
opening
*NL*
her
eyes
to
his
character
never
occurred
to
me
.
That
_
she
_
could
be
*NL*
in
any
danger
from
the
deception
never
entered
my
head
.
That
such
a
*NL*
consequence
as
_
this
_
could
ensue
,
you
may
easily
believe
,
was
far
*NL*
enough
from
my
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
they
all
removed
to
Brighton
,
therefore
,
you
had
no
reason
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
to
believe
them
fond
of
each
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
slightest
.
I
can
remember
no
symptom
of
affection
on
either
*NL*
side
;
and
had
anything
of
the
kind
been
perceptible
,
you
must
be
aware
*NL*
that
ours
is
not
a
family
on
which
it
could
be
thrown
away
.
When
first
*NL*
he
entered
the
corps
,
she
was
ready
enough
to
admire
him
;
but
so
we
all
*NL*
were
.
Every
girl
in
or
near
Meryton
was
out
of
her
senses
about
him
for
*NL*
the
first
two
months
;
but
he
never
distinguished
_
her
_
by
any
particular
*NL*
attention
;
and
,
consequently
,
after
a
moderate
period
of
extravagant
and
*NL*
wild
admiration
,
her
fancy
for
him
gave
way
,
and
others
of
the
regiment
,
*NL*
who
treated
her
with
more
distinction
,
again
became
her
favourites
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
easily
believed
,
that
however
little
of
novelty
could
be
added
*NL*
to
their
fears
,
hopes
,
and
conjectures
,
on
this
interesting
subject
,
by
*NL*
its
repeated
discussion
,
no
other
could
detain
them
from
it
long
,
during
*NL*
the
whole
of
the
journey
.
From
Elizabeth
's
thoughts
it
was
never
absent
.
*NL*
Fixed
there
by
the
keenest
of
all
anguish
,
self-reproach
,
she
could
find
*NL*
no
interval
of
ease
or
forgetfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
travelled
as
expeditiously
as
possible
,
and
,
sleeping
one
night
*NL*
on
the
road
,
reached
Longbourn
by
dinner
time
the
next
day
.
It
was
a
*NL*
comfort
to
Elizabeth
to
consider
that
Jane
could
not
have
been
wearied
*NL*
by
long
expectations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
Gardiners
,
attracted
by
the
sight
of
a
chaise
,
were
standing
*NL*
on
the
steps
of
the
house
as
they
entered
the
paddock
;
and
,
when
the
*NL*
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
,
the
joyful
surprise
that
lighted
up
their
*NL*
faces
,
and
displayed
itself
over
their
whole
bodies
,
in
a
variety
of
*NL*
capers
and
frisks
,
was
the
first
pleasing
earnest
of
their
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
jumped
out
;
and
,
after
giving
each
of
them
a
hasty
kiss
,
*NL*
hurried
into
the
vestibule
,
where
Jane
,
who
came
running
down
from
her
*NL*
mother
's
apartment
,
immediately
met
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
as
she
affectionately
embraced
her
,
whilst
tears
filled
the
*NL*
eyes
of
both
,
lost
not
a
moment
in
asking
whether
anything
had
been
*NL*
heard
of
the
fugitives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
''
replied
Jane
.
``
But
now
that
my
dear
uncle
is
come
,
I
hope
*NL*
everything
will
be
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
my
father
in
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
went
on
Tuesday
,
as
I
wrote
you
word
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
heard
from
him
often
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
heard
only
twice
.
He
wrote
me
a
few
lines
on
Wednesday
to
say
*NL*
that
he
had
arrived
in
safety
,
and
to
give
me
his
directions
,
which
I
*NL*
particularly
begged
him
to
do
.
He
merely
added
that
he
should
not
write
*NL*
again
till
he
had
something
of
importance
to
mention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
my
mother
--
how
is
she
?
How
are
you
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
is
tolerably
well
,
I
trust
;
though
her
spirits
are
greatly
*NL*
shaken
.
She
is
up
stairs
and
will
have
great
satisfaction
in
seeing
you
*NL*
all
.
She
does
not
yet
leave
her
dressing-room
.
Mary
and
Kitty
,
thank
*NL*
Heaven
,
are
quite
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
--
how
are
you
?
''
cried
Elizabeth
.
``
You
look
pale
.
How
much
you
*NL*
must
have
gone
through
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
sister
,
however
,
assured
her
of
her
being
perfectly
well
;
and
their
*NL*
conversation
,
which
had
been
passing
while
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
were
*NL*
engaged
with
their
children
,
was
now
put
an
end
to
by
the
approach
*NL*
of
the
whole
party
.
Jane
ran
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
and
welcomed
and
*NL*
thanked
them
both
,
with
alternate
smiles
and
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
all
in
the
drawing-room
,
the
questions
which
Elizabeth
*NL*
had
already
asked
were
of
course
repeated
by
the
others
,
and
they
soon
*NL*
found
that
Jane
had
no
intelligence
to
give
.
The
sanguine
hope
of
*NL*
good
,
however
,
which
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
suggested
had
not
yet
*NL*
deserted
her
;
she
still
expected
that
it
would
all
end
well
,
and
that
*NL*
every
morning
would
bring
some
letter
,
either
from
Lydia
or
her
father
,
*NL*
to
explain
their
proceedings
,
and
,
perhaps
,
announce
their
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
,
to
whose
apartment
they
all
repaired
,
after
a
few
minutes
'
*NL*
conversation
together
,
received
them
exactly
as
might
be
expected
;
with
*NL*
tears
and
lamentations
of
regret
,
invectives
against
the
villainous
*NL*
conduct
of
Wickham
,
and
complaints
of
her
own
sufferings
and
ill-usage
;
*NL*
blaming
everybody
but
the
person
to
whose
ill-judging
indulgence
the
*NL*
errors
of
her
daughter
must
principally
be
owing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
been
able
,
''
said
she
,
``
to
carry
my
point
in
going
to
Brighton
,
*NL*
with
all
my
family
,
_
this
_
would
not
have
happened
;
but
poor
dear
Lydia
*NL*
had
nobody
to
take
care
of
her
.
Why
did
the
Forsters
ever
let
her
go
out
*NL*
of
their
sight
?
I
am
sure
there
was
some
great
neglect
or
other
on
their
*NL*
side
,
for
she
is
not
the
kind
of
girl
to
do
such
a
thing
if
she
had
been
*NL*
well
looked
after
.
I
always
thought
they
were
very
unfit
to
have
the
*NL*
charge
of
her
;
but
I
was
overruled
,
as
I
always
am
.
Poor
dear
child
!
*NL*
And
now
here
's
Mr.
Bennet
gone
away
,
and
I
know
he
will
fight
Wickham
,
*NL*
wherever
he
meets
him
and
then
he
will
be
killed
,
and
what
is
to
become
*NL*
of
us
all
?
The
Collinses
will
turn
us
out
before
he
is
cold
in
his
*NL*
grave
,
and
if
you
are
not
kind
to
us
,
brother
,
I
do
not
know
what
we
*NL*
shall
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
exclaimed
against
such
terrific
ideas
;
and
Mr.
Gardiner
,
after
*NL*
general
assurances
of
his
affection
for
her
and
all
her
family
,
told
her
*NL*
that
he
meant
to
be
in
London
the
very
next
day
,
and
would
assist
Mr.
*NL*
Bennet
in
every
endeavour
for
recovering
Lydia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
give
way
to
useless
alarm
,
''
added
he
;
``
though
it
is
right
to
be
*NL*
prepared
for
the
worst
,
there
is
no
occasion
to
look
on
it

certain

*NL*
It
is
not
quite
a
week
since
they
left
Brighton
.
In
a
few
days
more
we
*NL*
may
gain
some
news
of
them
;
and
till
we
know
that
they
are
not
married
,
*NL*
and
have
no
design
of
marrying
,
do
not
let
us
give
the
matter
over
as
*NL*
lost
.
As
soon
as
I
get
to
town
I
shall
go
to
my
brother
,
and
make
*NL*
him
come
home
with
me
to
Gracechurch
Street
;
and
then
we
may
consult
*NL*
together
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
my
dear
brother

replied
Mrs.
Bennet
,
``
that
is
exactly
what
I
*NL*
could
most
wish
for

And
now
do
,
when
you
get
to
town

find
them
out
,
*NL*
wherever
they
may
be
;
and
if
they
are
not
married
already
,
_
make
_
them
*NL*
marry

And
as
for
wedding
clothes
,
do
not
let

wait
for
that

tell
Lydia
she
shall
have
as
much
money
as

buy
them
,
*NL*
after
they
are
married

And
,
above
all
,
keep
Mr.
Bennet
from
fighting

*NL*
Tell
him
what
a
dreadful
state
I
am
in

that
I
am
frighted
out
of
my
*NL*
wits

and
have
such
tremblings

such
flutterings

all
over
me

such

And
tell
my
dear

not

give
any
directions
about
her
clothes

she
has
seen
me

she
does

how
kind

I

you
will
contrive
it

*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Gardiner
,
though
he
assured
her
again
of
his
earnest
endeavours
*NL*
in
the
cause
,
could
not
avoid
recommending
moderation
to
her
,
as
well
*NL*
in
her
hopes
as
her
fear
;
and
after
talking
with
her
in
this
manner
till
*NL*
dinner
was
on
the
table
,
they
all
left
her
to
vent
all
her
feelings
on
*NL*
the
housekeeper
,
who
attended
in
the
absence
of
her
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
her
brother
and
sister
were
persuaded
that
there
was
no
real
*NL*
occasion
for
such
a
seclusion
from
the
family
,
they
did
not
attempt
to
*NL*
oppose
it
,
for
they
knew
that
she
had
not
prudence
enough
to
hold
her
*NL*
tongue
before
the
servants
,
while
they
waited
at
table
,
and
judged
it
*NL*
better
that
_
one
_
only
of
the
household
,
and
the
one

they
could
*NL*
most
trust
should
comprehend
all
her
fears
and
solicitude
on
the
*NL*
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
dining-room
they
were
soon
joined
by
Mary
and
Kitty
,
who
had
been
*NL*
too
busily
engaged
in
their
separate
apartments
to
make
their
appearance
*NL*
before
.
One
came
from
her
books
,
and
the
other
from
her
toilette
.
The
*NL*
faces
of
both
,
however
,
were
tolerably
calm
;
and
no
change
was
visible
*NL*
in
either
,
except
that
the
loss
of
her
favourite
sister
,
or
the
anger
*NL*
which
she
had
herself
incurred
in
this
business
,
had
given
more
of
*NL*
fretfulness
than
usual
to
the
accents
of
Kitty
.
As
for
Mary
,
she
was
*NL*
mistress
enough
of
herself
to
whisper
to
Elizabeth
,
with
a
countenance
*NL*
of
grave
reflection
,
soon
after
they
were
seated
at
table
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
most
unfortunate
affair
,
and
will
probably
be
much
talked
of
.
*NL*
But
we
must
stem
the
tide
of
malice
,
and
pour
into
the
wounded
bosoms
of
*NL*
each
other
the
balm
of
sisterly
consolation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
perceiving
in
Elizabeth
no
inclination
of
replying
,
she
added
,
*NL*
``
Unhappy
as
the
event
must
be
for
Lydia
,
we
may
draw
from
it
this
useful
*NL*
lesson
:
that
loss
of
virtue
in
a
female
is
irretrievable
;
that
one
*NL*
false
step
involves
her
in
endless
ruin
;
that
her
reputation
is
no
less
*NL*
brittle
than
it
is
beautiful
;
and
that
she
can
not
be
too
much
guarded
in
*NL*
her
behaviour
towards
the
undeserving
of
the
other
sex
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
lifted
up
her
eyes
in
amazement
,
but
was
too
much
oppressed
*NL*
to
make
any
reply
.
Mary
,
however
,
continued
to
console
herself
with
such
*NL*
kind
of
moral
extractions
from
the
evil
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
,
the
two
elder
Miss
Bennets
were
able
to
be
for
*NL*
half-an-hour
by
themselves
;
and
Elizabeth
instantly
availed
herself
of
*NL*
the
opportunity
of
making
any
inquiries
,
which
Jane
was
equally
eager
to
*NL*
satisfy
.
After
joining
in
general
lamentations
over
the
dreadful
sequel
*NL*
of
this
event
,
which
Elizabeth
considered
as
all
but
certain
,
and
Miss
*NL*
Bennet
could
not
assert
to
be
wholly
impossible
,
the
former
continued
*NL*
the
subject
,
by
saying
,
``
But
tell
me
all
and
everything
about
it
which
*NL*
I
have
not
already
heard
.
Give
me
further
particulars
.
What
did
Colonel
*NL*
Forster
say
?
Had
they
no
apprehension
of
anything
before
the
elopement
*NL*
took
place
?
They
must
have
seen
them
together
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
Forster
did
own
that
he
had
often
suspected
some
partiality
,
*NL*
especially
on
Lydia
's
side
,
but
nothing
to
give
him
any
alarm
.
I
am
so
*NL*
grieved
for
him
!
His
behaviour
was
attentive
and
kind
to
the
utmost
.
He
*NL*
_
was
_
coming
to
us
,
in
order
to
assure
us
of
his
concern
,
before
he
had
*NL*
any
idea
of
their
not
being
gone
to
Scotland
:
when
that
apprehension
*NL*
first
got
abroad
,
it
hastened
his
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
Denny
convinced
that
Wickham
would
not
marry
?
Did
he
know
of
*NL*
their
intending
to
go
off
?
Had
Colonel
Forster
seen
Denny
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
,
when
questioned
by
_
him
_
,
Denny
denied
knowing
anything
of
*NL*
their
plans
,
and
would
not
give
his
real
opinion
about
it
.
He
did
not
*NL*
repeat
his
persuasion
of
their
not
marrying
--
and
from
_
that
_
,
I
am
*NL*
inclined
to
hope
,
he
might
have
been
misunderstood
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
till
Colonel
Forster
came
himself
,
not
one
of
you
entertained
a
*NL*
doubt
,
I
suppose
,
of
their
being
really
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
it
possible
that
such
an
idea
should
enter
our
brains
?
I
felt
*NL*
a
little
uneasy
--
a
little
fearful
of
my
sister
's
happiness
with
him
*NL*
in
marriage
,
because
I
knew
that
his
conduct
had
not
been
always
quite
*NL*
right
.
My
father
and
mother
knew
nothing
of
that
;
they
only
felt
how
*NL*
imprudent
a
match
it
must
be
.
Kitty
then
owned
,
with
a
very
natural
*NL*
triumph
on
knowing
more
than
the
rest
of
us
,
that
in
Lydia
's
last
letter
*NL*
she
had
prepared
her
for
such
a
step
.
She
had
known
,
it
seems
,
of
their
*NL*
being
in
love
with
each
other
,
many
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
before
they
went
to
Brighton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
believe
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
Colonel
Forster
appear
to
think
well
of
Wickham
himself
?
Does
*NL*
he
know
his
real
character
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
confess
that
he
did
not
speak
so
well
of
Wickham
as
he
formerly
*NL*
did
.
He
believed
him
to
be
imprudent
and
extravagant
.
And
since
this
sad
*NL*
affair
has
taken
place
,
it
is
said
that
he
left
Meryton
greatly
in
debt
;
*NL*
but
I
hope
this
may
be
false
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Jane

had
we
been
less
secret

told

could
not
have
happened
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
,
''
replied
her
sister
.
``
But
to
expose
*NL*
the
former
faults
of
any
person
without
knowing
what
their

unjustifiable

Could

repeat

He

Jane
then
took
it

I
should
never

be
off

You
need
not

going

at

it

was
serious
on

Whatever
he

Mary

would

I
did
not

it
right

Kitty

slight

delicate

Mary
studies
so
much

My

he

his

so
greatly
discomposed

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
party
were
in
hopes
of
a
letter
from
Mr.
Bennet
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
but
the
post
came
in
without
bringing
a
single
line
from
him
.
*NL*
His
family
knew
him
to
be
,
on
all
common
occasions
,
a
most
negligent
and
*NL*
dilatory
correspondent
;
but
at
such
a
time
they
had
hoped
for
exertion
.
*NL*
They
were
forced
to
conclude
that
he
had
no
pleasing
intelligence
to
*NL*
send
;
but
even
of
_
that
_
they
would
have
been
glad
to
be
certain
.
Mr.
*NL*
Gardiner
had
waited
only
for
the
letters
before
he
set
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
gone
,
they
were
certain
at
least
of
receiving
constant
*NL*
information
of
what
was
going
on
,
and
their
uncle
promised
,
at
parting
,
*NL*
to
prevail
on
Mr.
Bennet
to
return
to
Longbourn
,
as
soon
as
he
could
,
*NL*
to
the
great
consolation
of
his
sister
,
who
considered
it
as
the
only
*NL*
security
for
her
husband
's
not
being
killed
in
a
duel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
and
the
children
were
to
remain
in
Hertfordshire
a
few
*NL*
days
longer
,
as
the
former
thought
her
presence
might
be
serviceable
*NL*
to
her
nieces
.
She
shared
in
their
attendance
on
Mrs.
Bennet
,
and
was
a
*NL*
great
comfort
to
them
in
their
hours
of
freedom
.
Their
other
aunt
also
*NL*
visited
them
frequently
,
and
always
,
as
she
said
,
with
the
design
of
*NL*
cheering
and
heartening
them
up
--
though
,
as
she
never
came
without
*NL*
reporting
some
fresh
instance
of
Wickham
's
extravagance
or
irregularity
,
*NL*
she
seldom
went
away
without
leaving
them
more
dispirited
than
she
found
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
Meryton
seemed
striving
to
blacken
the
man
who
,
but
three
months
*NL*
before
,
had
been
almost
an
angel
of
light
.
He
was
declared
to
be
in
debt
*NL*
to
every
tradesman
in
the
place
,
and
his
intrigues
,
all
honoured
with
*NL*
the
title
of
seduction
,
had
been
extended
into
every
tradesman
's
family
.
*NL*
Everybody
declared
that
he
was
the
wickedest
young
man
in
the
world
;
*NL*
and
everybody
began
to
find
out
that
they
had
always
distrusted
the
*NL*
appearance
of
his
goodness
.
Elizabeth
,
though
she
did
not
credit
above
*NL*
half
of
what
was
said
,
believed
enough
to
make
her
former
assurance
of
*NL*
her
sister
's
ruin
more
certain
;
and
even
Jane
,
who
believed
still
less
*NL*
of
it
,
became
almost
hopeless
,
more
especially
as
the
time
was
now
come
*NL*
when
,
if
they
had
gone
to
Scotland
,
which
she
had
never
before
entirely
*NL*
despaired
of
,
they
must
in
all
probability
have
gained
some
news
of
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gardiner
left
Longbourn
on
Sunday
;
on
Tuesday
his
wife
received
a
*NL*
letter
from
him
;
it
told
them
that
,
on
his
arrival
,
he
had
immediately
*NL*
found
out
his
brother
,
and
persuaded
him
to
come
to
Gracechurch
Street
;
*NL*
that
Mr.
Bennet
had
been
to
Epsom
and
Clapham
,
before
his
arrival
,
*NL*
but
without
gaining
any
satisfactory
information
;
and
that
he
was
now
*NL*
determined
to
inquire
at
all
the
principal
hotels
in
town
,
as
Mr.
Bennet
*NL*
thought
it
possible
they
might
have
gone
to
one
of
them
,
on
their
first
*NL*
coming
to
London
,
before
they
procured
lodgings
.
Mr.
Gardiner
himself
*NL*
did
not
expect
any
success
from
this
measure
,
but
as
his
brother
was
*NL*
eager
in
it
,
he
meant
to
assist
him
in
pursuing
it
.
He
added
that
Mr.
*NL*
Bennet
seemed
wholly
disinclined
at
present
to
leave
London
and
promised
*NL*
to
write
again
very
soon
.
There
was
also
a
postscript
to
this
effect
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
written
to
Colonel
Forster
to
desire
him
to
find
out
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
from
some
of
the
young
man
's
intimates
in
the
regiment
,
*NL*
whether
Wickham
has
any
relations
or
connections
who
would
be
likely
to
*NL*
know
in
what
part
of
town
he
has
now
concealed
himself
.
If
there
were
*NL*
anyone
that
one
could
apply
to
with
a
probability
of
gaining
such
a
*NL*
clue
as
that
,
it
might
be
of
essential
consequence
.
At
present
we
have
*NL*
nothing
to
guide
us
.
Colonel
Forster
will
,
I
dare
say
,
do
everything
in
*NL*
his
power
to
satisfy
us
on
this
head
.
But
,
on
second
thoughts
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
Lizzy
could
tell
us
what
relations
he
has
now
living
,
better
than
any
*NL*
other
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
from
whence
this
deference
to
her
*NL*
authority
proceeded
;
but
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
give
any
information
*NL*
of
so
satisfactory
a
nature
as
the
compliment
deserved
.
She
had
never
*NL*
heard
of
his
having
had
any
relations
,
except
a
father
and
mother
,
both
*NL*
of
whom
had
been
dead
many
years
.
It
was
possible
,
however
,
that
some
of
*NL*
his
companions
in
the
--
shire
might
be
able
to
give
more
information
;
*NL*
and
though
she
was
not
very
sanguine
in
expecting
it
,
the
application
*NL*
was
a
something
to
look
forward
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
at
Longbourn
was
now
a
day
of
anxiety
;
but
the
most
anxious
*NL*
part
of
each
was
when
the
post
was
expected
.
The
arrival
of
letters
*NL*
was
the
grand
object
of
every
morning
's
impatience
.
Through
letters
,
*NL*
whatever
of
good
or
bad
was
to
be
told
would
be
communicated
,
and
every
*NL*
succeeding
day
was
expected
to
bring
some
news
of
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
they
heard
again
from
Mr.
Gardiner
,
a
letter
arrived
for
*NL*
their
father
,
from
a
different
quarter
,
from
Mr.
Collins
;
which
,
as
Jane
*NL*
had
received
directions
to
open
all
that
came
for
him
in
his
absence
,
*NL*
she
accordingly
read
;
and
Elizabeth
,
who
knew
what
curiosities
his
*NL*
letters
always
were
,
looked
over
her
,
and
read
it
likewise
.
It
was
as
*NL*
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
MY
DEAR
SIR
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
myself
called
upon
,
by
our
relationship
,
and
my
situation
*NL*
in
life
,
to
condole
with
you
on
the
grievous
affliction
you
are
now
*NL*
suffering
under
,
of
which
we
were
yesterday
informed
by
a
letter
from
*NL*
Hertfordshire
.
Be
assured
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
Mrs.
Collins
and
myself
*NL*
sincerely
sympathise
with
you
and
all
your
respectable
family
,
in
*NL*
your
present
distress
,
which
must
be
of
the
bitterest
kind
,
because
*NL*
proceeding
from
a
cause
which
no
time
can
remove
.
No
arguments
shall
be
*NL*
wanting
on
my
part
that
can
alleviate
so
severe
a
misfortune
--
or
that
*NL*
may
comfort
you
,
under
a
circumstance
that
must
be
of
all
others
the
*NL*
most
afflicting
to
a
parent
's
mind
.
The
death
of
your
daughter
would
*NL*
have
been
a
blessing
in
comparison
of
this
.
And
it
is
the
more
to
*NL*
be
lamented
,
because
there
is
reason
to
suppose
as
my
dear
Charlotte
*NL*
informs
me
,
that
this
licentiousness
of
behaviour
in
your
daughter
has
*NL*
proceeded
from
a
faulty
degree
of
indulgence
;
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
for
the
consolation
of
yourself
and
Mrs.
Bennet
,
I
am
inclined
to
think
*NL*
that
her
own
disposition
must
be
naturally
bad
,
or
she
could
not
be
*NL*
guilty
of
such
an
enormity
,
at
so
early
an
age
.
Howsoever
that
may
be
,
*NL*
you
are
grievously
to
be
pitied
;
in
which
opinion
I
am
not
only
joined
*NL*
by
Mrs.
Collins
,
but
likewise
by
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter
,
to
*NL*
whom
I
have
related
the
affair
.
They
agree
with
me
in
apprehending
that
*NL*
this
false
step
in
one
daughter
will
be
injurious
to
the
fortunes
of
*NL*
all
the
others
;
for
who
,
as
Lady
Catherine
herself
condescendingly
says
,
*NL*
will
connect
themselves
with
such
a
family
?
And
this
consideration
leads
*NL*
me
moreover
to
reflect
,
with
augmented
satisfaction
,
on
a
certain
event
*NL*
of
last
November
;
for
had
it
been
otherwise
,
I
must
have
been
involved
*NL*
in
all
your
sorrow
and
disgrace
.
Let
me
then
advise
you
,
dear
sir
,
to
*NL*
console
yourself
as
much
as
possible
,
to
throw
off
your
unworthy
child
*NL*
from
your
affection
for
ever
,
and
leave
her
to
reap
the
fruits
of
her
*NL*
own
heinous
offense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
dear
sir
,
etc.

etc.

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gardiner
did
not
write
again
till
he
had
received
an
answer
from
*NL*
Colonel
Forster
;
and
then
he
had
nothing
of
a
pleasant
nature
to
send
.
*NL*
It
was
not
known
that
Wickham
had
a
single
relationship
with
whom
he
*NL*
kept
up
any
connection
,
and
it
was
certain
that
he
had
no
near
one
*NL*
living
.
His
former
acquaintances
had
been
numerous
;
but
since
he
*NL*
had
been
in
the
militia
,
it
did
not
appear
that
he
was
on
terms
of
*NL*
particular
friendship
with
any
of
them
.
There
was
no
one
,
therefore
,
*NL*
who
could
be
pointed
out
as
likely
to
give
any
news
of
him
.
And
in
the
*NL*
wretched
state
of
his
own
finances
,
there
was
a
very
powerful
motive
for
*NL*
secrecy
,
in
addition
to
his
fear
of
discovery
by
Lydia
's
relations
,
for
*NL*
it
had
just
transpired
that
he
had
left
gaming
debts
behind
him
to
a
*NL*
very
considerable
amount
.
Colonel
Forster
believed
that
more
than
a
*NL*
thousand
pounds
would
be
necessary
to
clear
his
expenses
at
Brighton
.
*NL*
He
owed
a
good
deal
in
town
,
but
his
debts
of
honour
were
still
more
*NL*
formidable
.
Mr.
Gardiner
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
these
particulars
*NL*
from
the
Longbourn
family
.
Jane
heard
them
with
horror
.
``
A
gamester
!
''
*NL*
she
cried
.
``
This
is
wholly
unexpected
.
I
had
not
an
idea
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gardiner
added
in
his
letter
,
that
they
might
expect
to
see
their
*NL*
father
at
home
on
the
following
day
,
which
was
Saturday
.
Rendered
*NL*
spiritless
by
the
ill-success
of
all
their
endeavours
,
he
had
yielded
*NL*
to
his
brother-in-law
's
entreaty
that
he
would
return
to
his
family
,
and
*NL*
leave
it
to
him
to
do
whatever
occasion
might
suggest
to
be
advisable
*NL*
for
continuing
their
pursuit
.
When
Mrs.
Bennet
was
told
of
this
,
she
did
*NL*
not
express
so
much
satisfaction
as
her
children
expected
,
considering
*NL*
what
her
anxiety
for
his
life
had
been
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
is
he
coming
home
,
and
without
poor
Lydia
?
''
she
cried
.
``
Sure
he
*NL*
will
not
leave
London
before
he
has
found
them
.
Who
is
to
fight
Wickham
,
*NL*
and
make
him
marry
her
,
if
he
comes
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mrs.
Gardiner
began
to
wish
to
be
at
home
,
it
was
settled
that
she
*NL*
and
the
children
should
go
to
London
,
at
the
same
time
that
Mr.
Bennet
*NL*
came
from
it
.
The
coach
,
therefore
,
took
them
the
first
stage
of
their
*NL*
journey
,
and
brought
its
master
back
to
Longbourn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
went
away
in
all
the
perplexity
about
Elizabeth
and
her
*NL*
Derbyshire
friend
that
had
attended
her
from
that
part
of
the
world
.
His
*NL*
name
had
never
been
voluntarily
mentioned
before
them
by
her
niece
;
and
*NL*
the
kind
of
half-expectation
which
Mrs.
Gardiner
had
formed
,
of
their
*NL*
being
followed
by
a
letter
from
him
,
had
ended
in
nothing
.
Elizabeth
had
*NL*
received
none
since
her
return
that
could
come
from
Pemberley
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
present
unhappy
state
of
the
family
rendered
any
other
excuse
for
*NL*
the
lowness
of
her
spirits
unnecessary
;
nothing
,
therefore
,
could
be
*NL*
fairly
conjectured
from
_
that
_
,
though
Elizabeth
,
who
was
by
this
time
*NL*
tolerably
well
acquainted
with
her
own
feelings
,
was
perfectly
aware
*NL*
that
,
had
she
known
nothing
of
Darcy
,
she
could
have
borne
the
dread
of
*NL*
Lydia
's
infamy
somewhat
better
.
It
would
have
spared
her
,
she
thought
,
*NL*
one
sleepless
night
out
of
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Bennet
arrived
,
he
had
all
the
appearance
of
his
usual
*NL*
philosophic
composure
.
He
said
as
little
as
he
had
ever
been
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
saying
;
made
no
mention
of
the
business
that
had
taken
him
*NL*
away
,
and
it
was
some
time
before
his
daughters
had
courage
to
speak
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
the
afternoon
,
when
he
had
joined
them
at
tea
,
that
*NL*
Elizabeth
ventured
to
introduce
the
subject
;
and
then
,
on
her
briefly
*NL*
expressing
her
sorrow
for
what
he
must
have
endured
,
he
replied
,
``
Say
*NL*
nothing
of
that
.
Who
should
suffer
but
myself
?
It
has
been
my
own
doing
,
*NL*
and
I
ought
to
feel
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
be
too
severe
upon
yourself
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
well
warn
me
against
such
an
evil
.
Human
nature
is
so
prone
*NL*
to
fall
into
it
!
No
,
Lizzy
,
let
me
once
in
my
life
feel
how
much
I
have
*NL*
been
to
blame
.
I
am
not
afraid
of
being
overpowered
by
the
impression
.
*NL*
It
will
pass
away
soon
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
them
to
be
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
where
else
can
they
be
so
well
concealed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Lydia
used
to
want
to
go
to
London
,
''
added
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
happy
then
,
''
said
her
father
drily
;
``
and
her
residence
there
*NL*
will
probably
be
of
some
duration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
after
a
short
silence
he
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizzy
,
I
bear
you
no
ill-will
for
being
justified
in
your
advice
to
me
*NL*
last
May
,
which
,
considering
the
event
,
shows
some
greatness
of
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
interrupted
by
Miss
Bennet
,
who
came
to
fetch
her
mother
's
*NL*
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
parade
,
''
he
cried
,
``
which
does
one
good
;
it
gives
such
an
*NL*
elegance
to
misfortune
!
Another
day
I
will
do
the
same
;
I
will
sit
in
my
*NL*
library
,
in
my
nightcap
and
powdering
gown
,
and
give
as
much
trouble
as
*NL*
I
can
;
or
,
perhaps
,
I
may
defer
it
till
Kitty
runs
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
going
to
run
away

said
Kitty
fretfully
.
``
If
I
should
*NL*
ever
go
to
Brighton

I
would
behave
better
than
Lydia

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You

go
to
Brighton

I
would
not
trust
you
so
near
it
as
Eastbourne

for
fifty
pounds
!
No
,
Kitty
,
I
have
at
last
learnt
to
be
cautious
,
and
*NL*
you
will
feel
the
effects
of
it

No
officer
is
ever
to
enter
into
*NL*
my
house
again

nor
even
to
pass
through
the
village

Balls
will
be
*NL*
absolutely
prohibited
,
unless
you
stand
up
with
one
of
your
sisters

you
are
never

stir
out

doors
till
you
can
prove

spent
ten
minutes

*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
,
who
took
all
these
threats
in
a
serious
light
,
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

he

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
after
Mr.
Bennet
's
return
,
as
Jane
and
Elizabeth
were
walking
*NL*
together
in
the
shrubbery
behind
the
house
,
they
saw
the
housekeeper
*NL*
coming
towards
them
,
and
,
concluding
that
she
came
to
call
them
to
their
*NL*
mother
,
went
forward
to
meet
her
;
but
,
instead
of
the
expected
summons
,
*NL*
when
they
approached
her
,
she
said
to
Miss
Bennet
,
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
*NL*
madam
,
for
interrupting
you
,
but
I
was
in
hopes
you
might
have
got
some
*NL*
good
news
from
town

so
I
took
the
liberty
of
coming
to
ask

Mrs.

in
great
astonishment
,
``

express
come

this
half-hour

has
had

*NL*
Away
ran
the
girls
,
too
eager
to
get
in
to
have

for

They
*NL*
ran
through
the
vestibule
into
the
breakfast-room
;
from
thence
to
the
*NL*
library
;
their
father
was
in
neither
;
and
they
were
on
the
point
of
*NL*
seeking
him
up
stairs
with
their
mother
,
when
they
were
met
by
the
*NL*
butler
,
who
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
looking
for
my
master
,
ma'am
,
he
is
walking
towards
the
*NL*
little
copse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
information
,
they
instantly
passed
through
the
hall
once
*NL*
more
,
and
ran
across
the
lawn
after
their
father
,
who
was
deliberately
*NL*
pursuing
his
way
towards
a
small
wood
on
one
side
of
the
paddock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
,
who
was
not
so
light
nor
so
much
in
the
habit
of
running
as
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
soon
lagged
behind
,
while
her
sister
,
panting
for
breath
,
*NL*
came
up
with
him
,
and
eagerly
cried
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
papa
,
what
news
--
what
news
?
Have
you
heard
from
my
uncle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
I
have
had
a
letter
from
him
by
express
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
news
does
it
bring
--
good
or
bad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
there
of
good
to
be
expected
?
''
said
he
,
taking
the
letter
from
*NL*
his
pocket
.
``
But
perhaps
you
would
like
to
read
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
impatiently
caught
it
from
his
hand
.
Jane
now
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
it
aloud

''
said
their
father
,
``

MY

,
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
I
am
able
to
send
you
some
tidings
of
my
niece
,
and
such
as
,
*NL*
upon
the
whole
,
I
hope
it
will
give
you
satisfaction
.
Soon
after
you
*NL*
left
me
on
Saturday
,
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
out
in
what
part
of
*NL*
London
they
were
.
The
particulars
I
reserve
till
we
meet
;
it
is
enough
*NL*
to
know
they
are
discovered
.
I
have
seen
them
both
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
as
I
always
hoped
,
''
cried
Jane
;
``
they
are
married
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
read
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
them
both
.
They
are
not
married
,
nor
can
I
find
there
*NL*
was
any
intention
of
being
so
;
but
if
you
are
willing
to
perform
the
*NL*
engagements
which
I
have
ventured
to
make
on
your
side
,
I
hope
it
will
*NL*
not
be
long
before
they
are
.
All
that
is
required
of
you
is
,
to
assure
*NL*
to
your
daughter
,
by
settlement
,
her
equal
share
of
the
five
thousand
*NL*
pounds
secured
among
your
children
after
the
decease
of
yourself
and
*NL*
my
sister
;
and
,
moreover
,
to
enter
into
an
engagement
of
allowing
her
,
*NL*
during
your
life
,
one
hundred
pounds
per
annum
.
These
are
conditions
*NL*
which
,
considering
everything
,
I
had
no
hesitation
in
complying
with
,
*NL*
as
far
as
I
thought
myself
privileged
,
for
you
.
I
shall
send
this
by
*NL*
express
,
that
no
time
may
be
lost
in
bringing
me
your
answer
.
You
*NL*
will
easily
comprehend
,
from
these
particulars
,
that
Mr.
Wickham
's
*NL*
circumstances
are
not
so
hopeless
as
they
are
generally
believed
to
be
.
*NL*
The
world
has
been
deceived
in
that
respect
;
and
I
am
happy
to
say
there
*NL*
will
be
some
little
money
,
even
when
all
his
debts
are
discharged
,
to
*NL*
settle
on
my
niece
,
in
addition
to
her
own
fortune
.
If
,
as
I
conclude
*NL*
will
be
the
case
,
you
send
me
full
powers
to
act
in
your
name
throughout
*NL*
the
whole
of
this
business
,
I
will
immediately
give
directions
to
*NL*
Haggerston
for
preparing
a
proper
settlement
.
There
will
not
be
the
*NL*
smallest
occasion
for
your
coming
to
town
again
;
therefore
stay
quiet
at
*NL*
Longbourn
,
and
depend
on
my
diligence
and
care
.
Send
back
your
answer
as
*NL*
fast
as
you
can
,
and
be
careful
to
write
explicitly
.
We
have
judged
it
*NL*
best
that
my
niece
should
be
married
from
this
house
,
of
which
I
hope
*NL*
you
will
approve
.
She
comes
to
us
to-day
.
I
shall
write
again
as
soon
as
*NL*
anything
more
is
determined
on
.
Yours

Most

before

*NL*
``

I
dislike

he
replied
;

And
so
saying

he
turned
back
with

and
walked
towards
the
house

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

I
ask

said
Elizabeth
;
``

the
terms

Complied

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

must
marry

There

nothing

But
there

are
two
things
that
I
want
very

one
is
,
how

money

laid

Jane
,
``

do

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

that
no

one
hundred
a
year

fifty
after
I
am

gone

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
true

said
Elizabeth
;

not
occurred
to

before

His
debts
to
be

something
still

Oh

it
must
be
my

doings

Generous

good
man

I
am

distressed
himself

A
small
sum
could
not
do
all
this

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
her
father
;
``
Wickham

a
fool

he
takes
her
with
a
farthing

less

ten

I
should
be
sorry
to
think
so
ill
of
him
,
*NL*
in
the
very
beginning
of
our
relationship

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
thousand

Heaven

How
is
half
such
a
sum

*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
made
no
answer
,
and
each
of
them
,
deep
in
thought
,
continued
*NL*
silent
till
they
reached
the
house
.
Their
father
then
went
on
to
the
*NL*
library
to
write
,
and
the
girls
walked
into
the
breakfast-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
are
really
to
be

cried
Elizabeth

as
soon
as
they
*NL*
were
by
themselves
.
``
How
strange
this
is

for

this

we
are
to
be

thankful

That
they
should
marry

small
as
is
their
chance

happiness

wretched
as
is
his
character

we
are
forced

rejoice

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
comfort
myself
with
thinking

replied
Jane
,
``
that
he
certainly
would
*NL*
not
marry
Lydia

he
had
not
a
real
regard

Though
our
kind
*NL*
uncle
has
done
something
towards
clearing
him
,
I
can
not
believe
that
ten
*NL*
thousand
pounds
,
or
anything
like
it
,
has
been
advanced
.
He
has
children
*NL*
of
his
own
,
and
may
have
more
.
How
could
he
spare
half
ten
thousand
*NL*
pounds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
were
ever
able
to
learn
what
Wickham
's
debts
have
been
,
''
said
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
``
and
how
much
is
settled
on
his
side
on
our
sister
,
we
shall
*NL*
exactly
know
what
Mr.
Gardiner
has
done
for
them
,
because
Wickham
has
*NL*
not
sixpence
of
his
own
.
The
kindness
of
my
uncle

aunt
can
never
*NL*
be
requited
.
Their
taking
her
home
,
and
affording
her
their
personal

protection
and
countenance

is
such
a
sacrifice
to
her
advantage

*NL*
years
of
gratitude
can
not
enough
acknowledge

By
this
time
she
is
*NL*
actually
with
them

If
such
goodness
does
not
make
her
miserable
now

she
will
never
deserve
to
be
happy

a
meeting
for

she
*NL*
first
sees

aunt

We
must
endeavour

side

:
``
I
hope
and
trust
they
will
yet
be
happy

His
consenting
to
*NL*
marry
her
is
a
proof
,
I
will
believe
,
that
he
is
come
to
a
right
way
of
*NL*
thinking
.
Their
mutual
affection
will
steady
them
;
and
I
flatter
myself
*NL*
they
will
settle
so
quietly
,
and
live
in
so
rational
a
manner
,
as
may
in
*NL*
time
make
their
past
imprudence
forgotten

*NL*
*NL*
``
Their
conduct
has
been
such

replied
Elizabeth
,
``
as
neither
you
,
nor
*NL*
I

nor
anybody

ever
forget

is
useless

talk

*NL*
It
now
occurred
to
the
girls
that
their
mother
was
in
all
likelihood
*NL*
perfectly
ignorant
of
what
had
happened
.
They
went
to
the
library
,
*NL*
therefore
,
and
asked
their
father
whether
he
would
not
wish
them
to
make
*NL*
it
known
to
her
.
He
was
writing
and
,
without
raising
his
head
,
coolly
*NL*
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
you
please
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
May
we
take
my
uncle
's
letter
to
read
to
her
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
whatever
you
like
,
and
get
away

*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
took
the
letter
from
his
writing-table
,
and
they
went
up
stairs
*NL*
together
.
Mary
and
Kitty
were
both
with
Mrs.
Bennet
:
one
communication
*NL*
would
,
therefore
,
do
for
all
.
After
a
slight
preparation
for
good
news
,
*NL*
the
letter
was
read
aloud
.
Mrs.
Bennet
could
hardly
contain
herself
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
Jane
had
read
Mr.
Gardiner
's
hope
of
Lydia
's
being
soon
*NL*
married
,
her
joy
burst
forth
,
and
every
following
sentence
added
to
its
*NL*
exuberance
.
She
was
now
in
an
irritation
as
violent
from
delight
,
as
she
*NL*
had
ever
been
fidgety
from
alarm
and
vexation
.
To
know
that
her
daughter
*NL*
would
be
married
was
enough
.
She
was
disturbed
by
no
fear
for
her
*NL*
felicity
,
nor
humbled
by
any
remembrance
of
her
misconduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

dear

she
cried

*NL*
Her
eldest
daughter
endeavoured
to
give
some
relief
to
the
violence
of
*NL*
these
transports
,
by
leading
her
thoughts
to
the
obligations
which
Mr.
*NL*
Gardiner
's
behaviour
laid
them
all
under
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
we
must
attribute
this
happy
conclusion

she
added
,
``
in
a
great
*NL*
measure
to
his
kindness

are
persuaded

pledged
himself
to

assist
Mr.
Wickham

money

``
Well

cried
her
mother
,
``
it
is
all
very
right

who
should
do
it

a
family

I

it

presents

was
only
sixteen

such

am
sure
I

I
will
dictate

you
write
for
me

We
will
settle
with
your
father
about

the
things
should
be
ordered
immediately

*NL*
She
was
then
proceeding
to
all
the
particulars
of
calico
,
muslin
,
and

cambric

would
shortly
have
dictated
some
very
plentiful
orders

not
Jane
,
though
with
some
difficulty
,
persuaded
her
to
wait
till

father
was
at
leisure
to
be
consulted

One
day
's
delay

she
observed

small
importance

was
too
happy
to
be
quite
*NL*
so
obstinate
as
usual
.
Other
schemes
,
too
,
came
into
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
to
Meryton
,
''
said
she
,
``
as
soon
as
I
am
dressed
,
and
tell
the
*NL*
good
,
good
news
to
my
sister
Philips
.
And
as
I
come
back
,
I
can
call
*NL*
on
Lady
Lucas
and
Mrs.
Long
.
Kitty
,
run
down
and
order
the
carriage

*NL*
An
airing
would
do
me
a
great
deal
of
good
,
I
am
sure
.
Girls
,
can
I
do
*NL*
anything
for
you
in
Meryton
?
Oh
!
Here
comes
Hill
!
My
dear
Hill
,
have
you
*NL*
heard
the
good
news
?
Miss
Lydia
is
going
to
be
married
;
and
you
shall
*NL*
all
have
a
bowl
of
punch
to
make
merry
at
her
wedding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hill
began
instantly
to
express
her
joy
.
Elizabeth
received
her
*NL*
congratulations
amongst
the
rest
,
and
then
,
sick
of
this
folly
,
took
*NL*
refuge
in
her
own
room
,
that
she
might
think
with
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Lydia
's
situation
must
,
at
best
,
be
bad
enough
;
but
that
it
was
*NL*
no
worse
,
she
had
need
to
be
thankful
.
She
felt
it
so
;
and
though
,
in
*NL*
looking
forward
,
neither
rational
happiness
nor
worldly
prosperity
could
*NL*
be
justly
expected
for
her
sister
,
in
looking
back
to
what
they
had
*NL*
feared
,
only
two
hours
ago
,
she
felt
all
the
advantages
of
what
they
had
*NL*
gained
.

Chapter
50
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
had
very
often
wished
before
this
period
of
his
life
that
,
*NL*
instead
of
spending
his
whole
income
,
he
had
laid
by
an
annual
sum
for
*NL*
the
better
provision
of
his
children
,
and
of
his
wife
,
if
she
survived
*NL*
him
.
He
now
wished
it
more
than
ever
.
Had
he
done
his
duty
in
that
*NL*
respect
,
Lydia
need
not
have
been
indebted
to
her
uncle
for
whatever
*NL*
of
honour
or
credit
could
now
be
purchased
for
her
.
The
satisfaction
of
*NL*
prevailing
on
one
of
the
most
worthless
young
men
in
Great
Britain
to
be
*NL*
her
husband
might
then
have
rested
in
its
proper
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
seriously
concerned
that
a
cause
of
so
little
advantage
to
anyone
*NL*
should
be
forwarded
at
the
sole
expense
of
his
brother-in-law
,
and
he
*NL*
was
determined
,
if
possible
,
to
find
out
the
extent
of
his
assistance
,
*NL*
and
to
discharge
the
obligation
as
soon
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
first
Mr.
Bennet
had
married
,
economy
was
held
to
be
perfectly
*NL*
useless
,
for
,
of
course
,
they
were
to
have
a
son
.
The
son
was
to
join
*NL*
in
cutting
off
the
entail
,
as
soon
as
he
should
be
of
age
,
and
the
widow
*NL*
and
younger
children
would
by
that
means
be
provided
for
.
Five
daughters
*NL*
successively
entered
the
world
,
but
yet
the
son
was
to
come
;
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
,
for
many
years
after
Lydia
's
birth
,
had
been
certain
that
he
*NL*
would
.
This
event
had
at
last
been
despaired
of
,
but
it
was
then
*NL*
too
late
to
be
saving
.
Mrs.
Bennet
had
no
turn
for
economy
,
and
her
*NL*
husband
's
love
of
independence
had
alone
prevented
their
exceeding
their
*NL*
income
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
thousand
pounds
was
settled
by
marriage
articles
on
Mrs.
Bennet
and
*NL*
the
children
.
But
in
what
proportions
it
should
be
divided
amongst
the
*NL*
latter
depended
on
the
will
of
the
parents
.
This
was
one
point
,
with
*NL*
regard
to
Lydia
,
at
least
,
which
was
now
to
be
settled
,
and
Mr.
Bennet
*NL*
could
have
no
hesitation
in
acceding
to
the
proposal
before
him
.
In
*NL*
terms
of
grateful
acknowledgment
for
the
kindness
of
his
brother
,
*NL*
though
expressed
most
concisely
,
he
then
delivered
on
paper
his
perfect
*NL*
approbation
of
all
that
was
done
,
and
his
willingness
to
fulfil
the
*NL*
engagements
that
had
been
made
for
him
.
He
had
never
before
supposed
*NL*
that
,
could
Wickham
be
prevailed
on
to
marry
his
daughter
,
it
would
*NL*
be
done
with
so
little
inconvenience
to
himself
as
by
the
present
*NL*
arrangement
.
He
would
scarcely
be
ten
pounds
a
year
the
loser
by
the
*NL*
hundred
that
was
to
be
paid
them
;
for
,
what
with
her
board
and
pocket
*NL*
allowance
,
and
the
continual
presents
in
money
which
passed
to
her
*NL*
through
her
mother
's
hands
,
Lydia
's
expenses
had
been
very
little
within
*NL*
that
sum
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
it
would
be
done
with
such
trifling
exertion
on
his
side
,
too
,
was
*NL*
another
very
welcome
surprise
;
for
his
wish
at
present
was
to
have
as
*NL*
little
trouble
in
the
business
as
possible
.
When
the
first
transports
*NL*
of
rage
which
had
produced
his
activity
in
seeking
her
were
over
,
he
*NL*
naturally
returned
to
all
his
former
indolence
.
His
letter
was
soon
*NL*
dispatched
;
for
,
though
dilatory
in
undertaking
business
,
he
was
quick
*NL*
in
its
execution
.
He
begged
to
know
further
particulars
of
what
he
*NL*
was
indebted
to
his
brother
,
but
was
too
angry
with
Lydia
to
send
any
*NL*
message
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
news
spread
quickly
through
the
house
,
and
with
proportionate
*NL*
speed
through
the
neighbourhood
.
It
was
borne
in
the
latter
with
decent
*NL*
philosophy
.
To
be
sure
,
it
would
have
been
more
for
the
advantage
*NL*
of
conversation
had
Miss
Lydia
Bennet
come
upon
the
town
;
or
,
as
the
*NL*
happiest
alternative
,
been
secluded
from
the
world
,
in
some
distant
*NL*
farmhouse
.
But
there
was
much
to
be
talked
of
in
marrying
her
;
and
the
*NL*
good-natured
wishes
for
her
well-doing
which
had
proceeded
before
from
*NL*
all
the
spiteful
old
ladies
in
Meryton
lost
but
a
little
of
their
spirit
*NL*
in
this
change
of
circumstances
,
because
with
such
an
husband
her
misery
*NL*
was
considered
certain
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
fortnight
since
Mrs.
Bennet
had
been
downstairs
;
but
on
this
*NL*
happy
day
she
again
took
her
seat
at
the
head
of
her
table
,
and
in
*NL*
spirits
oppressively
high
.
No
sentiment
of
shame
gave
a
damp
to
her
*NL*
triumph
.
The
marriage
of
a
daughter
,
which
had
been
the
first
object
*NL*
of
her
wishes
since
Jane
was
sixteen
,
was
now
on
the
point
of
*NL*
accomplishment
,
and
her
thoughts
and
her
words
ran
wholly
on
those
*NL*
attendants
of
elegant
nuptials
,
fine
muslins
,
new
carriages
,
and
*NL*
servants
.
She
was
busily
searching
through
the
neighbourhood
for
a
*NL*
proper
situation
for
her
daughter
,
and
,
without
knowing
or
considering
*NL*
what
their
income
might
be
,
rejected
many
as
deficient
in
size
and
*NL*
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Haye
Park
might
do
,
''
said
she
,
``
if
the
Gouldings
could
quit
it
--
or
the
*NL*
great
house
at
Stoke
,
if
the
drawing-room
were
larger
;
but
Ashworth
is
*NL*
too
far
off
!
I
could
not
bear
to
have
her
ten
miles
from
me
;
and
as
for
*NL*
Pulvis
Lodge
,
the
attics
are
dreadful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
allowed
her
to
talk
on
without
interruption
while
the
*NL*
servants
remained
.
But
when
they
had
withdrawn
,
he
said
to
her
:
``
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
,
before
you
take
any
or
all
of
these
houses
for
your
son
and
*NL*
daughter
,
let
us
come
to
a
right
understanding
.
Into
_
one
_
house
in
this
*NL*
neighbourhood
they
shall
never
have
admittance
.
I
will
not
encourage
the
*NL*
impudence
of
either
,
by
receiving
them
at
Longbourn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
dispute
followed
this
declaration
;
but
Mr.
Bennet
was
firm
.
It
*NL*
soon
led
to
another
;
and
Mrs.
Bennet
found
,
with
amazement
and
horror
,
*NL*
that
her
husband
would
not
advance
a
guinea
to
buy
clothes
for
his
*NL*
daughter
.
He
protested
that
she
should
receive
from
him
no
mark
of
*NL*
affection
whatever
on
the
occasion
.
Mrs.
Bennet
could
hardly
comprehend
*NL*
it
.
That
his
anger
could
be
carried
to
such
a
point
of
inconceivable
*NL*
resentment
as
to
refuse
his
daughter
a
privilege
without
which
her
*NL*
marriage
would
scarcely
seem
valid
,
exceeded
all
she
could
believe
*NL*
possible
.
She
was
more
alive
to
the
disgrace
which
her
want
of
new
*NL*
clothes
must
reflect
on
her
daughter
's
nuptials
,
than
to
any
sense
of
*NL*
shame
at
her
eloping
and
living
with
Wickham
a
fortnight
before
they
*NL*
took
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
now
most
heartily
sorry
that
she
had
,
from
the
distress
of
*NL*
the
moment
,
been
led
to
make
Mr.
Darcy
acquainted
with
their
fears
for
*NL*
her
sister
;
for
since
her
marriage
would
so
shortly
give
the
*NL*
proper
termination
to
the
elopement
,
they
might
hope
to
conceal
its
*NL*
unfavourable
beginning
from
all
those
who
were
not
immediately
on
the
*NL*
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
no
fear
of
its
spreading
farther
through
his
means
.
There
were
*NL*
few
people
on
whose
secrecy
she
would
have
more
confidently
depended
;
*NL*
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
there
was
no
one
whose
knowledge
of
a
sister
's
*NL*
frailty
would
have
mortified
her
so
much
--
not
,
however
,
from
any
fear
*NL*
of
disadvantage
from
it
individually
to
herself
,
for
,
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
there
seemed
a
gulf
impassable
between
them
.
Had
Lydia
's
marriage
been
*NL*
concluded
on
the
most
honourable
terms
,
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
would
connect
himself
with
a
family
where
,
to
every
other
*NL*
objection
,
would
now
be
added
an
alliance
and
relationship
of
the
*NL*
nearest
kind
with
a
man
whom
he
so
justly
scorned
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
such
a
connection
she
could
not
wonder
that
he
would
shrink
.
The
*NL*
wish
of
procuring
her
regard
,
which
she
had
assured
herself
of
his
*NL*
feeling
in
Derbyshire
,
could
not
in
rational
expectation
survive
such
a
*NL*
blow
as
this
.
She
was
humbled
,
she
was
grieved
;
she
repented
,
though
she
*NL*
hardly
knew
of
what
.
She
became
jealous
of
his
esteem
,
when
she
could
no
*NL*
longer
hope
to
be
benefited
by
it
.
She
wanted
to
hear
of
him
,
when
there
*NL*
seemed
the
least
chance
of
gaining
intelligence
.
She
was
convinced
that
*NL*
she
could
have
been
happy
with
him
,
when
it
was
no
longer
likely
they
*NL*
should
meet
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
triumph
for
him
,
as
she
often
thought
,
could
he
know
that
the
*NL*
proposals
which
she
had
proudly
spurned
only
four
months
ago
,
would
now
*NL*
have
been
most
gladly
and
gratefully
received
!
He
was
as
generous
,
she
*NL*
doubted
not
,
as
the
most
generous
of
his
sex
;
but
while
he
was
mortal
,
*NL*
there
must
be
a
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
now
to
comprehend
that
he
was
exactly
the
man
who
,
in
*NL*
disposition
and
talents
,
would
most
suit
her
.
His
understanding
and
*NL*
temper
,
though
unlike
her
own
,
would
have
answered
all
her
wishes
.
It
*NL*
was
an
union
that
must
have
been
to
the
advantage
of
both
;
by
her
ease
*NL*
and
liveliness
,
his
mind
might
have
been
softened
,
his
manners
improved
;
*NL*
and
from
his
judgement
,
information
,
and
knowledge
of
the
world
,
she
*NL*
must
have
received
benefit
of
greater
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
such
happy
marriage
could
now
teach
the
admiring
multitude
what
*NL*
connubial
felicity
really
was
.
An
union
of
a
different
tendency
,
and
*NL*
precluding
the
possibility
of
the
other
,
was
soon
to
be
formed
in
their
*NL*
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
Wickham
and
Lydia
were
to
be
supported
in
tolerable
independence
,
*NL*
she
could
not
imagine
.
But
how
little
of
permanent
happiness
could
*NL*
belong
to
a
couple
who
were
only
brought
together
because
their
passions
*NL*
were
stronger
than
their
virtue
,
she
could
easily
conjecture
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gardiner
soon
wrote
again
to
his
brother
.
To
Mr.
Bennet
's
*NL*
acknowledgments
he
briefly
replied
,
with
assurance
of
his
eagerness
to
*NL*
promote
the
welfare
of
any
of
his
family
;
and
concluded
with
entreaties
*NL*
that
the
subject
might
never
be
mentioned
to
him
again
.
The
principal
*NL*
purport
of
his
letter
was
to
inform
them
that
Mr.
Wickham
had
resolved
*NL*
on
quitting
the
militia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
greatly
my
wish
that
he
should
do
so
,
''
he
added
,
``
as
soon
as
*NL*
his
marriage
was
fixed
on
.
And
I
think
you
will
agree
with
me
,
in
*NL*
considering
the
removal
from
that
corps
as
highly
advisable
,
both
on
*NL*
his
account
and
my
niece
's
.
It
is
Mr.
Wickham
's
intention
to
go
into
*NL*
the
regulars
;
and
among
his
former
friends
,
there
are
still
some
who
*NL*
are
able
and
willing
to
assist
him
in
the
army
.
He
has
the
promise
of
an
*NL*
ensigncy
in
General
--
's
regiment
,
now
quartered
in
the
North
.
It
*NL*
is
an
advantage
to
have
it
so
far
from
this
part
of
the
kingdom
.
He
*NL*
promises
fairly
;
and
I
hope
among
different
people
,
where
they
may
each
*NL*
have
a
character
to
preserve
,
they
will
both
be
more
prudent
.
I
have
*NL*
written
to
Colonel
Forster
,
to
inform
him
of
our
present
arrangements
,
*NL*
and
to
request
that
he
will
satisfy
the
various
creditors
of
Mr.
Wickham
*NL*
in
and
near
Brighton
,
with
assurances
of
speedy
payment
,
for
which
I
*NL*
have
pledged
myself
.
And
will
you
give
yourself
the
trouble
of
carrying
*NL*
similar
assurances
to
his
creditors
in
Meryton
,
of
whom
I
shall
subjoin
*NL*
a
list
according
to
his
information
?
He
has
given
in
all
his
debts
;
I
*NL*
hope
at
least
he
has
not
deceived
us
.
Haggerston
has
our
directions
,
*NL*
and
all
will
be
completed
in
a
week
.
They
will
then
join
his
regiment
,
*NL*
unless
they
are
first
invited
to
Longbourn
;
and
I
understand
from
Mrs.
*NL*
Gardiner
,
that
my
niece
is

Mr.
Bennet
and
his
daughters
saw
all
the
advantages
of
Wickham
's
removal
*NL*
from
the
--
shire
as
clearly
as
Mr.
Gardiner
could
do
.
But
Mrs.
Bennet
*NL*
was
not
so
well
pleased
with
it
.
Lydia
's
being
settled
in
the
North
,
*NL*
just
when
she
had
expected
most
pleasure
and
pride
in
her
company
,
*NL*
for
she
had
by
no
means
given
up
her
plan
of
their
residing
in
*NL*
Hertfordshire
,
was
a
severe
disappointment
;
and
,
besides
,
it
was
such
a
*NL*
pity
that
Lydia
should
be
taken
from
a
regiment
where
she
was
acquainted
*NL*
with
everybody
,
and
had
so
many
favourites
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
so
fond
of
Mrs.
Forster
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
will
be
quite
shocking
*NL*
to
send
her
away
!
And
there
are
several
of
the
young
men
,
too
,
that
she
*NL*
likes
very
much
.
The
officers
may
not
be
so
pleasant
in
General
--
's
*NL*
regiment

*NL*
*NL*
His
daughter
's
request
,
for
such
it
might
be
considered
,
of
being
*NL*
admitted
into
her
family
again
before
she
set
off
for
the
North
,
*NL*
received
at
first
an
absolute
negative
.
But
Jane
and
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
who
agreed
in
wishing
,
for
the
sake
of
their
sister
's
feelings
and
*NL*
consequence
,
that
she
should
be
noticed
on
her
marriage
by
her
parents
,
*NL*
urged
him
so
earnestly
yet
so
rationally
and
so
mildly
,
to
receive
her
*NL*
and
her
husband
at
Longbourn
,
as
soon
as
they
were
married
,
that
he
was
*NL*
prevailed
on
to
think
as
they
thought
,
and
act
as
they
wished
.
And
their
*NL*
mother
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
would
be
able
to
show
*NL*
her
married
daughter
in
the
neighbourhood
before
she
was
banished
to
the
*NL*
North
.
When
Mr.
Bennet
wrote
again
to
his
brother
,
therefore
,
he
sent
*NL*
his
permission
for
them
to
come
;
and
it
was
settled
,
that
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
ceremony
was
over
,
they
should
proceed
to
Longbourn
.
Elizabeth
was
*NL*
surprised
,
however
,
that
Wickham
should
consent
to
such
a
scheme
,
and
*NL*
had
she
consulted
only
her
own
inclination
,
any
meeting
with
him
would
*NL*
have
been
the
last
object
of
her
wishes

*NL*
*NL*
Their
sister
's
wedding
day
arrived
;
and
Jane
and
Elizabeth
felt
for
her
*NL*
probably
more
than
she
felt
for
herself
.
The
carriage
was
sent
to
*NL*
meet
them
at
--
,
and
they
were
to
return
in
it
by
dinner-time
.
Their
*NL*
arrival
was
dreaded
by
the
elder
Miss
Bennets
,
and
Jane
more
especially
,
*NL*
who
gave
Lydia
the
feelings
which
would
have
attended
herself
,
had
she
*NL*
been
the
culprit
,
and
was
wretched
in
the
thought
of
what
her
sister
*NL*
must
endure
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
.
The
family
were
assembled
in
the
breakfast
room
to
receive
*NL*
them
.
Smiles
decked
the
face
of
Mrs.
Bennet
as
the
carriage
drove
up
to
*NL*
the
door
;
her
husband
looked
impenetrably
grave
;
her
daughters
,
alarmed
,
*NL*
anxious
,
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydia
's
voice
was
heard
in
the
vestibule
;
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
*NL*
she
ran
into
the
room
.
Her
mother
stepped
forwards
,
embraced
her
,
and
*NL*
welcomed
her
with
rapture
;
gave
her
hand
,
with
an
affectionate
smile
,
*NL*
to
Wickham
,
who
followed
his
lady
;
and
wished
them
both
joy
with
an
*NL*
alacrity
which
shewed
no
doubt
of
their
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
reception
from
Mr.
Bennet
,
to
whom
they
then
turned
,
was
not
quite
*NL*
so
cordial
.
His
countenance
rather
gained
in
austerity
;
and
he
scarcely
*NL*
opened
his
lips
.
The
easy
assurance
of
the
young
couple
,
indeed
,
was
*NL*
enough
to
provoke
him
.
Elizabeth
was
disgusted
,
and
even
Miss
Bennet
*NL*
was
shocked
.
Lydia
was
Lydia
still
;
untamed
,
unabashed
,
wild
,
noisy
,
*NL*
and
fearless
.
She
turned
from
sister
to
sister
,
demanding
their
*NL*
congratulations
;
and
when
at
length
they
all
sat
down
,
looked
eagerly
*NL*
round
the
room
,
took
notice
of
some
little
alteration
in
it
,
and
*NL*
observed
,
with
a
laugh
,
that
it
was
a
great
while
since
she
had
been
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wickham
was
not
at
all
more
distressed
than
herself
,
but
his
manners
*NL*
were
always
so
pleasing
,
that
had
his
character
and
his
marriage
been
*NL*
exactly
what
they
ought
,
his
smiles
and
his
easy
address
,
while
he
*NL*
claimed
their
relationship
,
would
have
delighted
them
all
.
Elizabeth
had
*NL*
not
before
believed
him
quite
equal
to
such
assurance
;
but
she
sat
down
,
*NL*
resolving
within
herself
to
draw
no
limits
in
future
to
the
impudence
*NL*
of
an
impudent
man
.
She
blushed
,
and
Jane
blushed
;
but
the
cheeks
of
the
*NL*
two
who
caused
their
confusion
suffered
no
variation
of
colour
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
want
of
discourse
.
The
bride
and
her
mother
could
neither
*NL*
of
them
talk
fast
enough
;
and
Wickham
,
who
happened
to
sit
near
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
began
inquiring
after
his
acquaintance
in
that
neighbourhood
,
*NL*
with
a
good
humoured
ease
which
she
felt
very
unable
to
equal
in
her
*NL*
replies
.
They
seemed
each
of
them
to
have
the
happiest
memories
in
the
*NL*
world
.
Nothing
of
the
past
was
recollected
with
pain
;
and
Lydia
led
*NL*
voluntarily
to
subjects
which
her
sisters
would
not
have
alluded
to
for
*NL*
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
think
of
its
being
three
months
,
''
she
cried
,
``
since
I
went
away
;
*NL*
it
seems
but
a
fortnight
I
declare
;
and
yet
there
have
been
things
*NL*
enough
happened
in
the
time
.
Good
gracious
!
when
I
went
away
,
I
am
sure
*NL*
I
had
no
more
idea
of
being
married
till
I
came
back
again
!
though
I
*NL*
thought
it
would
be
very
good
fun
if
I
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
lifted
up
his
eyes
.
Jane
was
distressed
.
Elizabeth
looked
*NL*
expressively
at
Lydia
;
but
she
,
who
never
heard
nor
saw
anything
of
*NL*
which
she
chose
to
be
insensible
,
gaily
continued
,
``
Oh
!
mamma
,
do
the
*NL*
people
hereabouts
know
I
am
married
to-day
?
I
was
afraid
they
might
not
;
*NL*
and
we
overtook
William
Goulding
in
his
curricle
,
so
I
was
determined
he
*NL*
should
know
it
,
and
so
I
let
down
the
side-glass
next
to
him
,
and
took
*NL*
off
my
glove
,
and
let
my
hand
just
rest
upon
the
window
frame
,
so
that
*NL*
he
might
see
the
ring
,
and
then
I
bowed
and
smiled
like
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
bear
it
no
longer
.
She
got
up
,
and
ran
out
of
the
room
;
*NL*
and
returned
no
more
,
till
she
heard
them
passing
through
the
hall
to
*NL*
the
dining
parlour
.
She
then
joined
them
soon
enough
to
see
Lydia
,
with
*NL*
anxious
parade
,
walk
up
to
her
mother
's
right
hand
,
and
hear
her
say
*NL*
to
her
eldest
sister
,
``
Ah
!
Jane
,
I
take
your
place
now
,
and
you
must
go
*NL*
lower
,
because
I
am
a
married
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
time
would
give
Lydia
that
embarrassment
*NL*
from
which
she
had
been
so
wholly
free
at
first
.
Her
ease
and
good
*NL*
spirits
increased
.
She
longed
to
see
Mrs.
Phillips
,
the
Lucases
,
and
*NL*
all
their
other
neighbours
,
and
to
hear
herself
called
``
Mrs.
Wickham
''
*NL*
by
each
of
them
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
she
went
after
dinner
to
show
her
*NL*
ring
,
and
boast
of
being
married
,
to
Mrs.
Hill
and
the
two
housemaids
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
mamma
,
''
said
she
,
when
they
were
all
returned
to
the
breakfast
*NL*
room
,
``
and
what
do
you
think
of
my
husband
?
Is
not
he
a
charming
man
?
I
*NL*
am
sure
my
sisters
must
all
envy
me
.
I
only
hope
they
may
have
half
*NL*
my
good
luck
.
They
must
all
go
to
Brighton
.
That
is
the
place
to
get
*NL*
husbands
.
What
a
pity
it
is
,
mamma
,
we
did
not
all
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
;
and
if
I
had
my
will
,
we
should
.
But
my
dear
Lydia
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
at
all
like
your
going
such
a
way
off
.
Must
it
be
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
lord
!
yes
;
--
there
is
nothing
in
that
.
I
shall
like
it
of
all
*NL*
things
.
You
and
papa
,
and
my
sisters
,
must
come
down
and
see
us
.
We
*NL*
shall
be
at
Newcastle
all
the
winter
,
and
I
dare
say
there
will
be
some
*NL*
balls
,
and
I
will
take
care
to
get
good
partners
for
them
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
it
beyond
anything
!
''
said
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
when
you
go
away
,
you
may
leave
one
or
two
of
my
sisters
*NL*
behind
you
;
and
I
dare
say
I
shall
get
husbands
for
them
before
the
*NL*
winter
is
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
for
my
share
of
the
favour
,
''
said
Elizabeth
;
``
but
I
do
not
*NL*
particularly
like
your
way
of
getting
husbands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
visitors
were
not
to
remain
above
ten
days
with
them
.
Mr.
Wickham
*NL*
had
received
his
commission
before
he
left
London
,
and
he
was
to
join
*NL*
his
regiment
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
but
Mrs.
Bennet
regretted
that
their
stay
would
be
so
short
;
and
*NL*
she
made
the
most
of
the
time
by
visiting
about
with
her
daughter
,
and
*NL*
having
very
frequent
parties
at
home
.
These
parties
were
acceptable
to
*NL*
all
;
to
avoid
a
family
circle
was
even
more
desirable
to
such
as
did
*NL*
think
,
than
such
as
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wickham
's
affection
for
Lydia
was
just
what
Elizabeth
had
expected
*NL*
to
find
it
;
not
equal
to
Lydia
's
for
him
.
She
had
scarcely
needed
her
*NL*
present
observation
to
be
satisfied
,
from
the
reason
of
things
,
that
*NL*
their
elopement
had
been
brought
on
by
the
strength
of
her
love
,
rather
*NL*
than
by
his
;
and
she
would
have
wondered
why
,
without
violently
caring
*NL*
for
her
,
he
chose
to
elope
with
her
at
all
,
had
she
not
felt
certain
*NL*
that
his
flight
was
rendered
necessary
by
distress
of
circumstances
;
and
*NL*
if
that
were
the
case
,
he
was
not
the
young
man
to
resist
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
having
a
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lydia
was
exceedingly
fond
of
him
.
He
was
her
dear
Wickham
on
every
*NL*
occasion
;
no
one
was
to
be
put
in
competition
with
him
.
He
did
every
*NL*
thing
best
in
the
world
;
and
she
was
sure
he
would
kill
more
birds
on
*NL*
the
first
of
September
,
than
any
body
else
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
soon
after
their
arrival
,
as
she
was
sitting
with
her
two
*NL*
elder
sisters
,
she
said
to
Elizabeth
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizzy
,
I
never
gave
_
you
_
an
account
of
my
wedding
,
I
believe
.
You
*NL*
were
not
by
,
when
I
told
mamma
and
the
others
all
about
it
.
Are
not
you
*NL*
curious
to
hear
how
it
was
managed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
really
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
;
``
I
think
there
can
not
be
too
little
said
*NL*
on
the
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
!
You
are
so
strange
!
But
I
must
tell
you
how
it
went
off
.
We
were
*NL*
married
,
you
know
,
at
St.
Clement
's
,
because
Wickham
's
lodgings
were
in
*NL*
that
parish
.
And
it
was
settled
that
we
should
all
be
there
by
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
.
My
uncle
and
aunt
and
I
were
to
go
together
;
and
the
others
*NL*
were
to
meet
us
at
the
church
.
Well
,
Monday
morning
came
,
and
I
was
in
*NL*
such
a
fuss
!
I
was
so
afraid
,
you
know
,
that
something
would
happen
to
*NL*
put
it
off
,
and
then
I
should
have
gone
quite
distracted
.
And
there
was
*NL*
my
aunt
,
all
the
time
I
was
dressing
,
preaching
and
talking
away
just
as
*NL*
if
she
was
reading
a
sermon
.
However
,
I
did
not
hear
above
one
word
in
*NL*
ten
,
for
I
was
thinking
,
you
may
suppose
,
of
my
dear
Wickham
.
I
longed
*NL*
to
know
whether
he
would
be
married
in
his
blue
coat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
so
we
breakfasted
at
ten
as
usual
;
I
thought
it
would
never
*NL*
be
over
;
for
,
by
the
bye
,
you
are
to
understand
,
that
my
uncle
and
aunt
*NL*
were
horrid
unpleasant
all
the
time
I
was
with
them
.
If
you
'll
believe
*NL*
me
,
I
did
not
once
put
my
foot
out
of
doors
,
though
I
was
there
a
*NL*
fortnight
.
Not
one
party
,
or
scheme
,
or
anything
.
To
be
sure
London
was
*NL*
rather
thin
,
but
,
however
,
the
Little
Theatre
was
open
.
Well
,
and
so
*NL*
just
as
the
carriage
came
to
the
door
,
my
uncle
was
called
away
upon
*NL*
business
to
that
horrid
man
Mr.
Stone
.
And
then
,
you
know
,
when
once
*NL*
they
get
together
,
there
is
no
end
of
it
.
Well
,
I
was
so
frightened
I
*NL*
did
not
know
what
to
do
,
for
my
uncle
was
to
give
me
away
;
and
if
we
*NL*
were
beyond
the
hour
,
we
could
not
be
married
all
day
.
But
,
luckily
,
he
*NL*
came
back
again
in
ten
minutes
'
time
,
and
then
we
all
set
out
.
However
,
*NL*
I
recollected
afterwards
that
if
he
had
been
prevented
going
,
the
*NL*
wedding
need
not
be
put
off
,
for
Mr.
Darcy
might
have
done
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Darcy
!
''
repeated
Elizabeth
,
in
utter
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
--
he
was
to
come
there
with
Wickham
,
you
know
.
But
gracious
*NL*
me
!
I
quite
forgot
!
I
ought
not
to
have
said
a
word
about
it
.
I
promised
*NL*
them
so
faithfully
!
What
will
Wickham
say
?
It
was
to
be
such
a
secret
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
was
to
be
secret
,
''
said
Jane
,
``
say
not
another
word
on
the
*NL*
subject
.
You
may
depend
upon
my
seeking
no
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
certainly
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
though
burning
with
curiosity
;
``
we
will
*NL*
ask
you
no
questions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Lydia
,
``
for
if
you
did
,
I
should
certainly
tell
you
*NL*
all
,
and
then
Wickham
would
be
angry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
such
encouragement
to
ask
,
Elizabeth
was
forced
to
put
it
out
of
her
*NL*
power
,
by
running
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
live
in
ignorance
on
such
a
point
was
impossible
;
or
at
least
*NL*
it
was
impossible
not
to
try
for
information
.
Mr.
Darcy
had
been
at
*NL*
her
sister
's
wedding
.
It
was
exactly
a
scene
,
and
exactly
among
people
,
*NL*
where
he
had
apparently
least
to
do
,
and
least
temptation
to
go
.
*NL*
Conjectures
as
to
the
meaning
of
it
,
rapid
and
wild
,
hurried
into
her
*NL*
brain
;
but
she
was
satisfied
with
none
.
Those
that
best
pleased
her
,
as
*NL*
placing
his
conduct
in
the
noblest
light
,
seemed
most
improbable
.
She
*NL*
could
not
bear
such
suspense
;
and
hastily
seizing
a
sheet
of
paper
,
*NL*
wrote
a
short
letter
to
her
aunt
,
to
request
an
explanation
of
what
*NL*
Lydia
had
dropt
,
if
it
were
compatible
with
the
secrecy
which
had
been
*NL*
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
readily
comprehend
,
''
she
added
,
``
what
my
curiosity
must
be
*NL*
to
know
how
a
person
unconnected
with
any
of
us
,
and
-LRB-
comparatively
*NL*
speaking
-RRB-
a
stranger
to
our
family
,
should
have
been
amongst
you
at
such
*NL*
a
time

Pray
write
instantly
,
and
let
me
understand
it
--
unless
it
is
,
*NL*
for
very
cogent
reasons
,
to
remain
in
the
secrecy
which
Lydia
seems
*NL*
to
think
necessary
;
and
then
I
must
endeavour
to
be
satisfied
with
*NL*
ignorance

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
I
_
shall

she
added
to
herself
,
as
she
finished
*NL*
the
letter
;
``

my
dear
aunt

if
you
do
not

an
honourable

be
reduced
to
tricks
and
stratagems
to
find
it
*NL*
out

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
's
delicate
sense
of
honour
would
not
allow
her
to
speak
to
*NL*
Elizabeth
privately
of
what
Lydia
had
let
fall
;
Elizabeth
was
glad
*NL*
of
it
;
--
till
it
appeared
whether
her
inquiries
would
receive
any
*NL*
satisfaction
,
she
had
rather
be
without
a
confidante

Elizabeth
had

She
was
no

she
sat
down

MY
DEAR
NIECE
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
received
your
letter
,
and
shall
devote
this
whole
morning
*NL*
to
answering
it
,
as
I
foresee
that
a
_
little
_
writing
will
not
comprise
*NL*
what
I
have
to
tell
you
.
I
must
confess
myself
surprised
by
your
*NL*
application
;
I
did
not
expect
it
from
_
you
_
.
Do
n't
think
me
angry
,
*NL*
however
,
for
I
only
mean
to
let
you
know
that
I
had
not
imagined
such
*NL*
inquiries
to
be
necessary
on
_
your
_
side
.
If
you
do
not
choose
to
*NL*
understand
me
,
forgive
my
impertinence
.
Your
uncle
is
as
much
surprised
*NL*
as
I
am
--
and
nothing
but
the
belief
of
your
being
a
party
concerned
*NL*
would
have
allowed
him
to
act
as
he
has
done
.
But
if
you
are
really
*NL*
innocent
and
ignorant
,
I
must
be
more
explicit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
very
day
of
my
coming
home
from
Longbourn
,
your
uncle
had
a
most
*NL*
unexpected
visitor
.
Mr.
Darcy
called
,
and
was
shut
up
with
him
several
*NL*
hours
.
It
was
all
over
before
I
arrived
;
so
my
curiosity
was
not
so
*NL*
dreadfully
racked
as
_
yours
_
seems
to
have
been
.
He
came
to
tell
Mr.
*NL*
Gardiner
that
he
had
found
out
where
your
sister
and
Mr.
Wickham
were
,
*NL*
and
that
he
had
seen
and
talked
with
them
both
;
Wickham
repeatedly
,
*NL*
Lydia
once
.
From
what
I
can
collect
,
he
left
Derbyshire
only
one
day
*NL*
after
ourselves
,
and
came
to
town
with
the
resolution
of
hunting
for
*NL*
them
.
The
motive
professed
was
his
conviction
of
its
being
owing
to
*NL*
himself
that
Wickham
's
worthlessness
had
not
been
so
well
known
as
to
*NL*
make
it
impossible
for
any
young
woman
of
character
to
love
or
confide
*NL*
in
him
.
He
generously
imputed
the
whole
to
his
mistaken
pride
,
and
*NL*
confessed
that
he
had
before
thought
it
beneath
him
to
lay
his
private
*NL*
actions
open
to
the
world
.
His
character
was
to
speak
for
itself
.
He
*NL*
called
it
,
therefore
,
his
duty
to
step
forward
,
and
endeavour
to
remedy
*NL*
an
evil
which
had
been
brought
on
by
himself
.
If
he
_
had
another
_
*NL*
motive
,
I
am
sure
it
would
never
disgrace
him
.
He
had
been
some
days
*NL*
in
town
,
before
he
was
able
to
discover
them
;
but
he
had
something
to
*NL*
direct
his
search
,
which
was
more
than
_
we
_
had
;
and
the
consciousness
*NL*
of
this
was
another
reason
for
his
resolving
to
follow
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
lady
,
it
seems
,
a
Mrs.
Younge
,
who
was
some
time
ago
*NL*
governess
to
Miss
Darcy
,
and
was
dismissed
from
her
charge
on
some
cause
*NL*
of
disapprobation
,
though
he
did
not
say
what
.
She
then
took
a
large
*NL*
house
in
Edward-street
,
and
has
since
maintained
herself
by
letting
*NL*
lodgings
.
This
Mrs.
Younge
was
,
he
knew
,
intimately
acquainted
with
*NL*
Wickham
;
and
he
went
to
her
for
intelligence
of
him
as
soon
as
he
got
to
*NL*
town
.
But
it
was
two
or
three
days
before
he
could
get
from
her
what
he
*NL*
wanted
.
She
would
not
betray
her
trust
,
I
suppose
,
without
bribery
and
*NL*
corruption
,
for
she
really
did
know
where
her
friend
was
to
be
found
.
*NL*
Wickham
indeed
had
gone
to
her
on
their
first
arrival
in
London
,
and
had
*NL*
she
been
able
to
receive
them
into
her
house
,
they
would
have
taken
up
*NL*
their
abode
with
her
.
At
length
,
however
,
our
kind
friend
procured
the
*NL*
wished-for
direction
.
They
were
in
--
street
.
He
saw
Wickham
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
insisted
on
seeing
Lydia
.
His
first
object
with
her
,
he
*NL*
acknowledged
,
had
been
to
persuade
her
to
quit
her
present
disgraceful
*NL*
situation
,
and
return
to
her
friends
as
soon
as
they
could
be
prevailed
*NL*
on
to
receive
her
,
offering
his
assistance
,
as
far
as
it
would
go
.
But
*NL*
he
found
Lydia
absolutely
resolved
on
remaining
where
she
was
.
She
cared
*NL*
for
none
of
her
friends
;
she
wanted
no
help
of
his
;
she
would
not
hear
*NL*
of
leaving
Wickham
.
She
was
sure
they
should
be
married
some
time
or
*NL*
other
,
and
it
did
not
much
signify
when
.
Since
such
were
her
feelings
,
*NL*
it
only
remained
,
he
thought
,
to
secure
and
expedite
a
marriage
,
which
,
*NL*
in
his
very
first
conversation
with
Wickham
,
he
easily
learnt
had
never
*NL*
been
_
his
_
design
.
He
confessed
himself
obliged
to
leave
the
regiment
,
*NL*
on
account
of
some
debts
of
honour
,
which
were
very
pressing
;
and
*NL*
scrupled
not
to
lay
all
the
ill-consequences
of
Lydia
's
flight
on
her
*NL*
own
folly
alone
.
He
meant
to
resign
his
commission
immediately
;
and
as
*NL*
to
his
future
situation
,
he
could
conjecture
very
little
about
it
.
He
*NL*
must
go
somewhere
,
but
he
did
not
know
where
,
and
he
knew
he
should
have
*NL*
nothing
to
live
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Darcy
asked
him
why
he
had
not
married
your
sister
at
once
.
Though
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
was
not
imagined
to
be
very
rich
,
he
would
have
been
able
*NL*
to
do
something
for
him
,
and
his
situation
must
have
been
benefited
by
*NL*
marriage
.
But
he
found
,
in
reply
to
this
question
,
that
Wickham
still
*NL*
cherished
the
hope
of
more
effectually
making
his
fortune
by
marriage
in
*NL*
some
other
country
.
Under
such
circumstances
,
however
,
he
was
not
likely
*NL*
to
be
proof
against
the
temptation
of
immediate
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
met
several
times
,
for
there
was
much
to
be
discussed
.
Wickham
of
*NL*
course
wanted
more
than
he
could
get
;
but
at
length
was
reduced
to
be
*NL*
reasonable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
thing
being
settled
between
_
them
_
,
Mr.
Darcy
's
next
step
was
to
*NL*
make
your
uncle
acquainted
with
it
,
and
he
first
called
in
Gracechurch
*NL*
street
the
evening
before
I
came
home
.
But
Mr.
Gardiner
could
not
be
*NL*
seen
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
found
,
on
further
inquiry
,
that
your
father
was
*NL*
still
with
him
,
but
would
quit
town
the
next
morning
.
He
did
not
judge
*NL*
your
father
to
be
a
person
whom
he
could
so
properly
consult
as
your
*NL*
uncle
,
and
therefore
readily
postponed
seeing
him
till
after
the
*NL*
departure
of
the
former
.
He
did
not
leave
his
name
,
and
till
the
next
*NL*
day
it
was
only
known
that
a
gentleman
had
called
on
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
Saturday
he
came
again
.
Your
father
was
gone
,
your
uncle
at
home
,
*NL*
and
,
as
I
said
before
,
they
had
a
great
deal
of
talk
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
met
again
on
Sunday
,
and
then
_
I
_
saw
him
too
.
It
was
not
all
*NL*
settled
before
Monday
:
as
soon
as
it
was
,
the
express
was
sent
off
to
*NL*
Longbourn
.
But
our
visitor
was
very
obstinate
.
I
fancy
,
Lizzy
,
that
*NL*
obstinacy
is
the
real
defect
of
his
character
,
after
all
.
He
has
been
*NL*
accused
of
many
faults
at
different
times
,
but
_
this
_
is
the
true
one
.
*NL*
Nothing
was
to
be
done
that
he
did
not
do
himself
;
though
I
am
sure
-LRB-
and
*NL*
I
do
not
speak
it
to
be
thanked
,
therefore
say
nothing
about
it
-RRB-
,
your
*NL*
uncle
would
most
readily
have
settled
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
battled
it
together
for
a
long
time
,
which
was
more
than
either
*NL*
the
gentleman
or
lady
concerned
in
it
deserved
.
But
at
last
your
uncle
*NL*
was
forced
to
yield
,
and
instead
of
being
allowed
to
be
of
use
to
his
*NL*
niece
,
was
forced
to
put
up
with
only
having
the
probable
credit
of
it
,
*NL*
which
went
sorely
against
the
grain
;
and
I
really
believe
your
letter
*NL*
this
morning
gave
him
great
pleasure
,
because
it
required
an
explanation
*NL*
that
would
rob
him
of
his
borrowed
feathers
,
and
give
the
praise
where
*NL*
it
was
due
.
But
,
Lizzy
,
this
must
go
no
farther
than
yourself
,
or
Jane
*NL*
at
most
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
pretty
well
,
I
suppose
,
what
has
been
done
for
the
young
*NL*
people
.
His
debts
are
to
be
paid
,
amounting
,
I
believe
,
to
considerably
*NL*
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
,
another
thousand
in
addition
to
her
own
*NL*
settled
upon
_
her
_
,
and
his
commission
purchased
.
The
reason
why
all
*NL*
this
was
to
be
done
by
him
alone
,
was
such
as
I
have
given
above
.
It
*NL*
was
owing
to
him
,
to
his
reserve
and
want
of
proper
consideration
,
that
*NL*
Wickham
's
character
had
been
so
misunderstood
,
and
consequently
that
he
*NL*
had
been
received
and
noticed
as
he
was
.
Perhaps
there
was
some
truth
*NL*
in
_
this
_
;
though
I
doubt
whether
_
his
_
reserve
,
or
_
anybody
's
_
reserve
,
*NL*
can
be
answerable
for
the
event
.
But
in
spite
of
all
this
fine
talking
,
*NL*
my
dear
Lizzy
,
you
may
rest
perfectly
assured
that
your
uncle
would
*NL*
never
have
yielded
,
if
we
had
not
given
him
credit
for
_
another
*NL*
interest
_
in
the
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
all
this
was
resolved
on
,
he
returned
again
to
his
friends
,
who
*NL*
were
still
staying
at
Pemberley
;
but
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
be
in
*NL*
London
once
more
when
the
wedding
took
place
,
and
all
money
matters
were
*NL*
then
to
receive
the
last
finish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
I
have
now
told
you
every
thing
.
It
is
a
relation
which
*NL*
you
tell
me
is
to
give
you
great
surprise
;
I
hope
at
least
it
will
not
*NL*
afford
you
any
displeasure

Lydia
came
to

house

was

had

perceived
,
by
Jane
's
letter
last
Wednesday
,
that
her
conduct
on
coming
*NL*
home
was
exactly
of
a
piece
with
it
,
and
therefore
what
I
now
tell
*NL*
you
can
give
you
no
fresh
pain
.
I
talked
to
her
repeatedly
in
the
most
*NL*
serious
manner
,
representing
to
her
all
the
wickedness
of
what
she
had
*NL*
done
,
and
all
the
unhappiness
she
had
brought
on
her
family
.
If
she
*NL*
heard
me
,
it
was
by
good
luck
,
for
I
am
sure
she
did
not
listen
.
I
was
*NL*
sometimes
quite
provoked
,
but
then
I
recollected
my
dear
Elizabeth
and
*NL*
Jane
,
and
for
their
sakes
had
patience
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Darcy
was
punctual
in
his
return
,
and
as
Lydia
informed
you
,
*NL*
attended
the
wedding
.
He
dined
with
us
the
next
day
,
and
was
to
leave
*NL*
town
again
on
Wednesday
or
Thursday
.
Will
you
be
very
angry
with
me
,
my
*NL*
dear
Lizzy
,
if
I
take
this
opportunity
of
saying
-LRB-
what
I
was
never
bold
*NL*
enough
to
say
before
-RRB-
how
much
I
like
him
.
His
behaviour
to
us
has
,
*NL*
in
every
respect
,
been
as
pleasing
as
when
we
were
in
Derbyshire
.
His
*NL*
understanding
and
opinions
all
please
me
;
he
wants
nothing
but
a
little
*NL*
more
liveliness
,
and
_
that
_
,
if
he
marry
_
prudently
_
,
his
wife
may
teach
*NL*
him
.
I
thought
him
very
sly
;
--
he
hardly
ever
mentioned
your
name
.
But
*NL*
slyness
seems
the
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
forgive
me
if
I
have
been
very
presuming
,
or
at
least
do
not
*NL*
punish
me
so
far
as
to
exclude
me
from
P.
I
shall
never
be
quite
happy
*NL*
till
I
have
been
all
round
the
park
.
A
low
phaeton
,
with
a
nice
little
*NL*
pair
of
ponies
,
would
be
the
very
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
write
no
more
.
The
children
have
been
wanting
me
this
half
*NL*
hour

sincerely

The
contents
of
this
letter
threw
Elizabeth
into
a
flutter
of
spirits
,
*NL*
in
which
it
was
difficult
to
determine
whether
pleasure
or
pain
bore
the
*NL*
greatest
share
.
The
vague
and
unsettled
suspicions
which
uncertainty
had
*NL*
produced
of
what
Mr.
Darcy
might
have
been
doing
to
forward
her
sister
's
*NL*
match
,
which
she
had
feared
to
encourage
as
an
exertion
of
goodness
too
*NL*
great
to
be
probable
,
and
at
the
same
time
dreaded
to
be
just
,
from
the
*NL*
pain
of
obligation
,
were
proved
beyond
their
greatest
extent
to
be
true
!
*NL*
He
had
followed
them
purposely
to
town
,
he
had
taken
on
himself
all
*NL*
the
trouble
and
mortification
attendant
on
such
a
research
;
in
which
*NL*
supplication
had
been
necessary
to
a
woman
whom
he
must
abominate
and
*NL*
despise
,
and
where
he
was
reduced
to
meet
,
frequently
meet
,
reason
*NL*
with
,
persuade
,
and
finally
bribe
,
the
man
whom
he
always
most
wished
to
*NL*
avoid
,
and
whose
very
name
it
was
punishment
to
him
to
pronounce
.
He
had
*NL*
done
all
this
for
a
girl
whom
he
could
neither
regard
nor
esteem
.
Her
*NL*
heart
did
whisper
that
he
had
done
it
for
her
.
But
it
was
a
hope
shortly
*NL*
checked
by
other
considerations
,
and
she
soon
felt
that
even
her
vanity
*NL*
was
insufficient
,
when
required
to
depend
on
his
affection
for
her
--
for
*NL*
a
woman
who
had
already
refused
him
--
as
able
to
overcome
a
sentiment
so
*NL*
natural
as
abhorrence
against
relationship
with
Wickham
.
Brother-in-law
*NL*
of
Wickham
!
Every
kind
of
pride
must
revolt
from
the
connection
.
He
had
,
*NL*
to
be
sure
,
done
much
.
She
was
ashamed
to
think
how
much
.
But
he
had
*NL*
given
a
reason
for
his
interference
,
which
asked
no
extraordinary
*NL*
stretch
of
belief
.
It
was
reasonable
that
he
should
feel
he
had
been
*NL*
wrong
;
he
had
liberality
,
and
he
had
the
means
of
exercising
it
;
and
*NL*
though
she
would
not
place
herself
as
his
principal
inducement
,
she
*NL*
could
,
perhaps
,
believe
that
remaining
partiality
for
her
might
assist
*NL*
his
endeavours
in
a
cause
where
her
peace
of
mind
must
be
materially
*NL*
concerned
.
It
was
painful
,
exceedingly
painful
,
to
know
that
they
were
*NL*
under
obligations
to
a
person
who
could
never
receive
a
return
.
They
*NL*
owed
the
restoration
of
Lydia
,
her
character
,
every
thing
,
to
him
.
Oh
!
*NL*
how
heartily
did
she
grieve
over
every
ungracious
sensation
she
had
ever
*NL*
encouraged
,
every
saucy
speech
she
had
ever
directed
towards
him
.
For
*NL*
herself
she
was
humbled
;
but
she
was
proud
of
him
.
Proud
that
in
a
cause
*NL*
of
compassion
and
honour
,
he
had
been
able
to
get
the
better
of
himself
.
*NL*
She
read
over
her
aunt
's
commendation
of
him
again
and
again
.
It
*NL*
was
hardly
enough
;
but
it
pleased
her
.
She
was
even
sensible
of
some
*NL*
pleasure
,
though
mixed
with
regret
,
on
finding
how
steadfastly
both
she
*NL*
and
her
uncle
had
been
persuaded
that
affection
and
confidence
subsisted
*NL*
between
Mr.
Darcy
and
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
roused
from
her
seat
,
and
her
reflections
,
by
some
one
's
*NL*
approach
;
and
before
she
could
strike
into
another
path
,
she
was
*NL*
overtaken
by
Wickham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
I
interrupt
your
solitary
ramble
,
my
dear
sister
?
''
said
he
,
*NL*
as
he
joined
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
certainly
do
,
''
she
replied
with
a
smile
;
``
but
it
does
not
follow
*NL*
that
the
interruption
must
be
unwelcome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
sorry
indeed
,
if
it
were
.
We
were
always
good
friends
;
and
*NL*
now
we
are
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True

Are
the
others
coming
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
.
Mrs.
Bennet
and
Lydia
are
going
in
the
carriage
to
*NL*
Meryton
.
And
so
,
my
dear
sister
,
I
find
,
from
our
uncle
and
aunt
,
that
*NL*
you
have
actually
seen
Pemberley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
almost
envy
you
the
pleasure
,
and
yet
I
believe
it
would
be
too
much
*NL*
for
me
,
or
else
I
could
take
it
in
my
way
to
Newcastle
.
And
you
saw
the
*NL*
old
housekeeper
,
I
suppose
?
Poor
Reynolds
,
she
was
always
very
fond
of
*NL*
me
.
But
of
course
she
did
not
mention
my
name
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
she
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
were
gone
into
the
army
,
and
she
was
afraid
had
--
not
turned
*NL*
out
well
.
At
such
a
distance
as
_
that
_
,
you
know
,
things
are
strangely
*NL*
misrepresented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
he
replied
,
biting
his
lips
.
Elizabeth
hoped
she
had
*NL*
silenced
him
;
but
he
soon
afterwards
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
surprised
to
see
Darcy
in
town
last
month
.
We
passed
each
other
*NL*
several
times
.
I
wonder
what
he
can
be
doing
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
preparing
for
his
marriage
with
Miss
de
Bourgh
,
''
said
*NL*
Elizabeth
.
``
It
must
be
something
particular
,
to
take
him
there
at
this
*NL*
time
of
year

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
.
Did
you
see
him
while
you
were
at
Lambton

I
thought
I
*NL*
understood
from
the
Gardiners
that
you
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
introduced
us
to
his
sister

*NL*
*NL*
``

do
you
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

*NL*
``
I
have
heard

indeed

that
she
is
uncommonly
improved
within
this
year

two

When
I
last
saw
her
,
she
was
not
very
promising

I
am
very
glad

liked
her

I
hope
she
will
turn
out
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
she
will
;
she
has
got
over
the
most
trying
age

Did
you
go
by
the
village
of
Kympton

recollect

most
delightful

Excellent
Parsonage

``
How

*NL*

Exceedingly
well

I

it

They
were
now
almost
at

had
walked
fast

get
rid

unwilling

held
out
her
hand

he
kissed
it

affectionate
gallantry

Mr.
Wickham
was
so
perfectly
satisfied
with
this
conversation
that
he
*NL*
never
again
distressed
himself
,
or
provoked
his
dear
sister
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
by
introducing
the
subject
of
it
;
and
she
was
pleased
to
find
that
she

had
said
enough
to
keep
him
quiet

The
day
of
his

departure
soon
came

Mrs.
Bennet

*NL*
forced
to
submit
to

separation

as
her
husband
by
no

*NL*
entered
into

scheme

their
all
going

was
likely

continue
at

a
twelvemonth

*NL*
``

Mr.
Wickham
's
adieus
were
much
more
affectionate
than
his
wife

.
He
*NL*
smiled

looked
handsome
,
and
said
many
pretty
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
as
fine
a

said
Mr.
Bennet
,
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
*NL*
the
house
,
``
as
ever
I
saw

He
simpers

smirks

prodigiously
proud

The
loss
of
her
daughter
made
Mrs.
Bennet
very
dull
for
several
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
often
think

said
she
,
``
that
there
is
nothing

bad

parting

so
forlorn

``
This
is
the
consequence

But
the
spiritless
condition
which
this
event
threw
her
into
was
shortly
*NL*
relieved
,
and
her
mind
opened
again
to
the
agitation
of
hope
,
by
an
*NL*
article
of
news
which
then
began
to
be
in
circulation

The
housekeeper

coming
down
in

day

two

to
shoot
there
for
several

weeks

Mrs.

was
quite
in
the
fidgets

looked
at

her
head

it
,
though
.
He
is
nothing
to
us
,
you
know
,
and
I
am
*NL*
sure
_
I
_
never
want
to
see
him
again
.
But
,
however
,
he
is
very
welcome
*NL*
to
come
to
Netherfield
,
if
he
likes
it
.
And
who
knows
what
_
may
_
happen
?
*NL*
But
that
is
nothing
to
us
.
You
know
,
sister
,
we
agreed
long
ago
never
to
*NL*
mention
a
word
about
it
.
And
so
,
is
it
quite
certain
he
is
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
depend
on
it
,
''
replied
the
other
,
``
for
Mrs.
Nicholls
was
in
*NL*
Meryton
last
night
;
I
saw
her
passing
by
,
and
went
out
myself
on
purpose
*NL*
to
know
the
truth
of
it
;
and
she
told
me
that
it
was
certain
true
.
He
*NL*
comes
down
on
Thursday
at
the
latest
,
very
likely
on
Wednesday
.
She
was
*NL*
going
to
the
butcher
's
,
she
told
me
,
on
purpose
to
order
in
some
meat
on
*NL*
Wednesday
,
and
she
has
got
three
couple
of
ducks
just
fit
to
be
killed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bennet
had
not
been
able
to
hear
of
his
coming
without
changing
*NL*
colour
.
It
was
many
months
since
she
had
mentioned
his
name
to
*NL*
Elizabeth
;
but
now
,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
together
,
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
look
at
me
to-day
,
Lizzy
,
when
my
aunt
told
us
of
the
present
*NL*
report
;
and
I
know
I
appeared
distressed
.
But
do
n't
imagine
it
was
from
*NL*
any
silly
cause
.
I
was
only
confused
for
the
moment
,
because
I
felt
that
*NL*
I
_
should
_
be
looked
at
.
I
do
assure
you
that
the
news
does
not
affect
*NL*
me
either
with
pleasure
or
pain
.
I
am
glad
of
one
thing
,
that
he
comes
*NL*
alone
;
because
we
shall
see
the
less
of
him
.
Not
that
I
am
afraid
of
*NL*
_
myself
_
,
but
I
dread
other
people
's
remarks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
Had
she
not
seen
him
in
*NL*
Derbyshire
,
she
might
have
supposed
him
capable
of
coming
there
with
no
*NL*
other
view
than
what
was
acknowledged
;
but
she
still
thought
him
partial
*NL*
to
Jane
,
and
she
wavered
as
to
the
greater
probability
of
his
coming
*NL*
there
_
with
_
his
friend
's
permission
,
or
being
bold
enough
to
come
*NL*
without
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
it
is
hard
,
''
she
sometimes
thought
,
``
that
this
poor
man
can
not
*NL*
come
to
a
house
which
he
has
legally
hired
,
without
raising
all
this
*NL*
speculation
!
I
_
will
_
leave
him
to
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
what
her
sister
declared
,
and
really
believed
to
be
her
*NL*
feelings
in
the
expectation
of
his
arrival
,
Elizabeth
could
easily
*NL*
perceive
that
her
spirits
were
affected
by
it
.
They
were
more
disturbed
,
*NL*
more
unequal
,
than
she
had
often
seen
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
which
had
been
so
warmly
canvassed
between
their
parents
,
*NL*
about
a
twelvemonth
ago
,
was
now
brought
forward
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
ever
Mr.
Bingley
comes
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bennet
,
``
you
*NL*
will
wait
on
him
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
You
forced
me
into
visiting
him
last
year
,
and
promised
,
if
I
*NL*
went
to
see
him
,
he
should
marry
one
of
my
daughters
.
But
it
ended
in
*NL*
nothing
,
and
I
will
not
be
sent
on
a
fool
's
errand
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
represented
to
him
how
absolutely
necessary
such
an
attention
*NL*
would
be
from
all
the
neighbouring
gentlemen
,
on
his
returning
to
*NL*
Netherfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
an
etiquette
I
despise
,
''
said
he
.
``
If
he
wants
our
society
,
*NL*
let
him
seek
it
.
He
knows
where
we
live
.
I
will
not
spend
my
hours
*NL*
in
running
after
my
neighbours
every
time
they
go
away
and
come
back
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
I
know
is
,
that
it
will
be
abominably
rude
if
you
do
not
wait
*NL*
on
him
.
But
,
however
,
that
sha
n't
prevent
my
asking
him
to
dine
here
,
I
*NL*
am
determined
.
We
must
have
Mrs.
Long
and
the
Gouldings
soon
.
That
will
*NL*
make
thirteen
with
ourselves
,
so
there
will
be
just
room
at
table
for
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Consoled
by
this
resolution
,
she
was
the
better
able
to
bear
her
*NL*
husband
's
incivility
;
though
it
was
very
mortifying
to
know
that
her
*NL*
neighbours
might
all
see
Mr.
Bingley
,
in
consequence
of
it
,
before
*NL*
_
they
_
did
.
As
the
day
of
his
arrival
drew
near
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
begin
to
be
sorry
that
he
comes
at
all
,
''
said
Jane
to
her
sister
.
``
It
*NL*
would
be
nothing
;
I
could
see
him
with
perfect
indifference
,
but
I
can
*NL*
hardly
bear
to
hear
it
thus
perpetually
talked
of
.
My
mother
means
well
;
*NL*
but
she
does
not
know
,
no
one
can
know
,
how
much
I
suffer
from
what
she
*NL*
says
.
Happy
shall
I
be
,
when
his
stay
at
Netherfield
is
over
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
say
anything
to
comfort
you
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
;
``
but
it
*NL*
is
wholly
out
of
my
power
.
You
must
feel
it
;
and
the
usual
satisfaction
*NL*
of
preaching
patience
to
a
sufferer
is
denied
me
,
because
you
have
*NL*
always
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bingley
arrived
.
Mrs.
Bennet
,
through
the
assistance
of
servants
,
*NL*
contrived
to
have
the
earliest
tidings
of
it
,
that
the
period
of
anxiety
*NL*
and
fretfulness
on
her
side
might
be
as
long
as
it
could
.
She
counted
*NL*
the
days
that
must
intervene
before
their
invitation
could
be
sent
;
*NL*
hopeless
of
seeing
him
before
.
But
on
the
third
morning
after
his
*NL*
arrival
in
Hertfordshire
,
she
saw
him
,
from
her
dressing-room
window
,
*NL*
enter
the
paddock
and
ride
towards
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
daughters
were
eagerly
called
to
partake
of
her
joy
.
Jane
resolutely
*NL*
kept
her
place
at
the
table
;
but
Elizabeth
,
to
satisfy
her
mother
,
went
*NL*
to
the
window
--
she
looked
,
--
she
saw
Mr.
Darcy
with
him
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
again
by
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
gentleman
with
him
,
mamma
,
''
said
Kitty
;
``
who
can
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
acquaintance
or
other
,
my
dear
,
I
suppose
;
I
am
sure
I
do
not
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
!
''
replied
Kitty
,
``
it
looks
just
like
that
man
that
used
to
be
with
*NL*
him
before
.
Mr.
what
's
-
his-name
.
That
tall
,
proud
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
!
Mr.
Darcy
!
--
and
so
it
does
,
I
vow
.
Well
,
any
friend
of
*NL*
Mr.
Bingley
's
will
always
be
welcome
here
,
to
be
sure
;
but
else
I
must
*NL*
say
that
I
hate
the
very
sight
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
looked
at
Elizabeth
with
surprise
and
concern
.
She
knew
but
little
*NL*
of
their
meeting
in
Derbyshire
,
and
therefore
felt
for
the
awkwardness
*NL*
which
must
attend
her
sister
,
in
seeing
him
almost
for
the
first
time
*NL*
after
receiving
his
explanatory
letter
.
Both
sisters
were
uncomfortable
*NL*
enough
.
Each
felt
for
the
other
,
and
of
course
for
themselves
;
and
their
*NL*
mother
talked
on
,
of
her
dislike
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
and
her
resolution
to
be
*NL*
civil
to
him
only
as
Mr.
Bingley
's
friend
,
without
being
heard
by
either
*NL*
of
them
.
But
Elizabeth
had
sources
of
uneasiness
which
could
not
be
*NL*
suspected
by
Jane
,
to
whom
she
had
never
yet
had
courage
to
shew
Mrs.
*NL*
Gardiner
's
letter
,
or
to
relate
her
own
change
of
sentiment
towards
him
.
*NL*
To
Jane
,
he
could
be
only
a
man
whose
proposals
she
had
refused
,
*NL*
and
whose
merit
she
had
undervalued
;
but
to
her
own
more
extensive
*NL*
information
,
he
was
the
person
to
whom
the
whole
family
were
indebted
*NL*
for
the
first
of
benefits
,
and
whom
she
regarded
herself
with
an
*NL*
interest
,
if
not
quite
so
tender
,
at
least
as
reasonable
and
just
as
*NL*
what
Jane
felt
for
Bingley
.
Her
astonishment
at
his
coming
--
at
his
*NL*
coming
to
Netherfield
,
to
Longbourn
,
and
voluntarily
seeking
her
again
,
*NL*
was
almost
equal
to
what
she
had
known
on
first
witnessing
his
altered
*NL*
behaviour
in
Derbyshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
colour
which
had
been
driven
from
her
face
,
returned
for
half
a
*NL*
minute
with
an
additional
glow
,
and
a
smile
of
delight
added
lustre
to
*NL*
her
eyes
,
as
she
thought
for
that
space
of
time
that
his
affection
and
*NL*
wishes
must
still
be
unshaken
.
But
she
would
not
be
secure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
first
see
how
he
behaves
,
''
said
she
;
``
it
will
then
be
early
*NL*
enough
for
expectation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
intently
at
work
,
striving
to
be
composed
,
and
without
daring
to
*NL*
lift
up
her
eyes
,
till
anxious
curiosity
carried
them
to
the
face
of
*NL*
her
sister
as
the
servant
was
approaching
the
door
.
Jane
looked
a
little
*NL*
paler
than
usual
,
but
more
sedate
than
Elizabeth
had
expected
.
On
the
*NL*
gentlemen
's
appearing
,
her
colour
increased
;
yet
she
received
them
with
*NL*
tolerable
ease
,
and
with
a
propriety
of
behaviour
equally
free
from
any
*NL*
symptom
of
resentment
or
any
unnecessary
complaisance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
said
as
little
to
either
as
civility
would
allow
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
again
to
her
work
,
with
an
eagerness
which
it
did
not
often
command
.
She
*NL*
had
ventured
only
one
glance
at
Darcy
.
He
looked
serious
,
as
usual
;
and
,
*NL*
she
thought
,
more
as
he
had
been
used
to
look
in
Hertfordshire
,
than
as
*NL*
she
had
seen
him
at
Pemberley
.
But
,
perhaps
he
could
not
in
her
mother
's
*NL*
presence
be
what
he
was
before
her
uncle
and
aunt
.
It
was
a
painful
,
but
*NL*
not
an
improbable
,
conjecture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bingley
,
she
had
likewise
seen
for
an
instant
,
and
in
that
short
period
*NL*
saw
him
looking
both
pleased
and
embarrassed
.
He
was
received
by
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
with
a
degree
of
civility
which
made
her
two
daughters
ashamed
,
*NL*
especially
when
contrasted
with
the
cold
and
ceremonious
politeness
of
*NL*
her
curtsey
and
address
to
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
particularly
,
who
knew
that
her
mother
owed
to
the
latter
*NL*
the
preservation
of
her
favourite
daughter
from
irremediable
infamy
,
*NL*
was
hurt
and
distressed
to
a
most
painful
degree
by
a
distinction
so
ill
*NL*
applied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darcy
,
after
inquiring
of
her
how
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
did
,
a
question
*NL*
which
she
could
not
answer
without
confusion
,
said
scarcely
anything
.
He
*NL*
was
not
seated
by
her
;
perhaps
that
was
the
reason
of
his
silence
;
but
*NL*
it
had
not
been
so
in
Derbyshire
.
There
he
had
talked
to
her
friends
,
*NL*
when
he
could
not
to
herself
.
But
now
several
minutes
elapsed
without
*NL*
bringing
the
sound
of
his
voice
;
and
when
occasionally
,
unable
to
resist
*NL*
the
impulse
of
curiosity
,
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
,
she
as
often
*NL*
found
him
looking
at
Jane
as
at
herself
,
and
frequently
on
no
object
but
*NL*
the
ground
.
More
thoughtfulness
and
less
anxiety
to
please
,
than
when
*NL*
they
last
met
,
were
plainly
expressed
.
She
was
disappointed
,
and
angry
*NL*
with
herself
for
being
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
I
expect
it
to
be
otherwise
!
''
said
she
.
``
Yet
why
did
he
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
no
humour
for
conversation
with
anyone
but
himself
;
and
to
*NL*
him
she
had
hardly
courage
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
inquired
after
his
sister
,
but
could
do
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
long
time
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
since
you
went
away
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bennet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
readily
agreed
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
began
to
be
afraid
you
would
never
come
back
again
.
People
_
did
_
say
*NL*
you
meant
to
quit
the
place
entirely
at
Michaelmas
;
but
,
however
,
I
hope
*NL*
it
is
not
true
.
A
great
many
changes
have
happened
in
the
neighbourhood
,
*NL*
since
you
went
away
.
Miss
Lucas
is
married
and
settled
.
And
one
of
my
*NL*
own
daughters
.
I
suppose
you
have
heard
of
it
;
indeed
,
you
must
have
*NL*
seen
it
in
the
papers
.
It
was
in
The
Times
and
The
Courier
,
I
know
;
*NL*
though
it
was
not
put
in
as
it
ought
to
be
.
It
was
only
said
,
`
Lately
,
*NL*
George
Wickham
,
Esq.
to
Miss
Lydia
Bennet
,
'
without
there
being
a
*NL*
syllable
said
of
her
father
,
or
the
place
where
she
lived
,
or
anything
.
*NL*
It
was
my
brother
Gardiner
's
drawing
up
too
,
and
I
wonder
how
he
came
to
*NL*
make
such
an
awkward
business
of
it
.
Did
you
see
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bingley
replied
that
he
did
,
and
made
his
congratulations
.
Elizabeth
*NL*
dared
not
lift
up
her
eyes
.
How
Mr.
Darcy
looked
,
therefore
,
she
could
*NL*
not
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
delightful
thing
,
to
be
sure
,
to
have
a
daughter
well
married
,
''
*NL*
continued
her
mother
,
``
but
at
the
same
time
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
it
is
very
*NL*
hard
to
have
her
taken
such
a
way
from
me
.
They
are
gone
down
to
*NL*
Newcastle
,
a
place
quite
northward
,
it
seems
,
and
there
they
are
to
stay
*NL*
I
do
not
know
how
long
.
His
regiment
is
there
;
for
I
suppose
you
have
*NL*
heard
of
his
leaving
the
--
shire
,
and
of
his
being
gone
into
the
*NL*
regulars
.
Thank
Heaven
!
he
has
_
some
_
friends
,
though
perhaps
not
so
*NL*
many
as
he
deserves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
who
knew
this
to
be
levelled
at
Mr.
Darcy
,
was
in
such
*NL*
misery
of
shame
,
that
she
could
hardly
keep
her
seat
.
It
drew
from
her
,
*NL*
however
,
the
exertion
of
speaking
,
which
nothing
else
had
so
effectually
*NL*
done
before
;
and
she
asked
Bingley
whether
he
meant
to
make
any
stay
in
*NL*
the
country
at
present
.
A
few
weeks
,
he
believed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
have
killed
all
your
own
birds
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
''
said
her
mother
,
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
will
come
here
,
and
shoot
as
many
as
you
please
on
Mr.
*NL*
Bennet
's
manor
.
I
am
sure
he
will
be
vastly
happy
to
oblige
you
,
and
*NL*
will
save
all
the
best
of
the
covies
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
misery
increased
,
at
such
unnecessary
,
such
officious
*NL*
attention
!
Were
the
same
fair
prospect
to
arise
at
present
as
had
*NL*
flattered
them
a
year
ago
,
every
thing
,
she
was
persuaded
,
would
be
*NL*
hastening
to
the
same
vexatious
conclusion
.
At
that
instant
,
she
felt
*NL*
that
years
of
happiness
could
not
make
Jane
or
herself
amends
for
*NL*
moments
of
such
painful
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
wish
of
my
heart
,
''
said
she
to
herself
,
``
is
never
more
to
*NL*
be
in
company
with
either
of
them
.
Their
society
can
afford
no
pleasure
*NL*
that
will
atone
for
such
wretchedness
as
this
!
Let
me
never
see
either
*NL*
one
or
the
other
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
the
misery
,
for
which
years
of
happiness
were
to
offer
no
*NL*
compensation
,
received
soon
afterwards
material
relief
,
from
observing
*NL*
how
much
the
beauty
of
her
sister
re-kindled
the
admiration
of
her
*NL*
former
lover
.
When
first
he
came
in
,
he
had
spoken
to
her
but
little
;
*NL*
but
every
five
minutes
seemed
to
be
giving
her
more
of
his
attention
.
He
*NL*
found
her
as
handsome
as
she
had
been
last
year
;
as
good
natured
,
and
*NL*
as
unaffected
,
though
not
quite
so
chatty
.
Jane
was
anxious
that
no
*NL*
difference
should
be
perceived
in
her
at
all
,
and
was
really
persuaded
*NL*
that
she
talked
as
much
as
ever
.
But
her
mind
was
so
busily
engaged
,
*NL*
that
she
did
not
always
know
when
she
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
gentlemen
rose
to
go
away
,
Mrs.
Bennet
was
mindful
of
her
*NL*
intended
civility
,
and
they
were
invited
and
engaged
to
dine
at
*NL*
Longbourn
in
a
few
days
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
a
visit
in
my
debt
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
''
she
added
,
``
for
when
*NL*
you
went
to
town
last
winter
,
you
promised
to
take
a
family
dinner
with
*NL*
us
,
as
soon
as
you
returned
.
I
have
not
forgot
,
you
see
;
and
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
I
was
very
much
disappointed
that
you
did
not
come
back
and
keep
*NL*
your
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bingley
looked
a
little
silly
at
this
reflection
,
and
said
something
of
*NL*
his
concern
at
having
been
prevented
by
business
.
They
then
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
had
been
strongly
inclined
to
ask
them
to
stay
and
dine
*NL*
there
that
day
;
but
,
though
she
always
kept
a
very
good
table
,
she
did
*NL*
not
think
anything
less
than
two
courses
could
be
good
enough
for
a
man
*NL*
on
whom
she
had
such
anxious
designs
,
or
satisfy
the
appetite
and
pride
*NL*
of
one
who
had
ten
thousand
a
year
.

As
soon
as
they
were
gone
,
Elizabeth
walked
out
to
recover
her
spirits
;
*NL*
or
in
other
words
,
to
dwell
without
interruption
on
those
subjects
that
*NL*
must
deaden
them
more
.
Mr.
Darcy
's
behaviour
astonished
and
vexed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
if
he
came
only
to
be
silent
,
grave
,
and
indifferent
,
''
said
she
,
*NL*
``
did
he
come
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
settle
it
in
no
way
that
gave
her
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
could
be
still
amiable
,
still
pleasing
,
to
my
uncle
and
aunt
,
when
*NL*
he
was
in
town
;
and
why
not
to
me
?
If
he
fears
me
,
why
come
hither
?
If
*NL*
he
no
longer
cares
for
me
,
why
silent
?
Teasing
,
teasing
,
man
!
I
will
*NL*
think
no
more
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
resolution
was
for
a
short
time
involuntarily
kept
by
the
approach
*NL*
of
her
sister
,
who
joined
her
with
a
cheerful
look
,
which
showed
her
*NL*
better
satisfied
with
their
visitors
,
than
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
this
first
meeting
is
over
,
I
feel
perfectly
*NL*
easy
.
I
know
my
own
strength
,
and
I
shall
never
be
embarrassed
again
by
*NL*
his
coming
.
I
am
glad
he
dines
here
on
Tuesday
.
It
will
then
be
publicly
*NL*
seen
that
,
on
both
sides
,
we
meet
only
as
common
and
indifferent
*NL*
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
indifferent
indeed
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
laughingly
.
``
Oh
,
Jane
,
*NL*
take
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Lizzy
,
you
can
not
think
me
so
weak
,
as
to
be
in
danger
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
in
very
great
danger
of
making
him
as
much
in
love
with
*NL*
you
as
ever

''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
see
the
gentlemen
again
till
Tuesday
;
and
Mrs.
Bennet
,
in
*NL*
the
meanwhile
,
was
giving
way
to
all
the
happy
schemes
,
which
the
good
*NL*
humour
and
common
politeness
of
Bingley
,
in
half
an
hour
's
visit
,
had
*NL*
revived
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Tuesday
there
was
a
large
party
assembled
at
Longbourn
;
and
the
two
*NL*
who
were
most
anxiously
expected
,
to
the
credit
of
their
punctuality
*NL*
as
sportsmen
,
were
in
very
good
time
.
When
they
repaired
to
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
Elizabeth
eagerly
watched
to
see
whether
Bingley
would
take
*NL*
the
place
,
which
,
in
all
their
former
parties
,
had
belonged
to
him
,
by
*NL*
her
sister
.
Her
prudent
mother
,
occupied
by
the
same
ideas
,
forbore
*NL*
to
invite
him
to
sit
by
herself
.
On
entering
the
room
,
he
seemed
to
*NL*
hesitate
;
but
Jane
happened
to
look
round
,
and
happened
to
smile
:
it
was
*NL*
decided
.
He
placed
himself
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
with
a
triumphant
sensation
,
looked
towards
his
friend
.
*NL*
He
bore
it
with
noble
indifference
,
and
she
would
have
imagined
that
*NL*
Bingley
had
received
his
sanction
to
be
happy
,
had
she
not
seen
his
eyes
*NL*
likewise
turned
towards
Mr.
Darcy
,
with
an
expression
of
half-laughing
*NL*
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
behaviour
to
her
sister
was
such
,
during
dinner
time
,
as
showed
an
*NL*
admiration
of
her
,
which
,
though
more
guarded
than
formerly
,
persuaded
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
that
if
left
wholly
to
himself
,
Jane
's
happiness
,
and
his
*NL*
own
,
would
be
speedily
secured
.
Though
she
dared
not
depend
upon
the
*NL*
consequence
,
she
yet
received
pleasure
from
observing
his
behaviour
.
It
*NL*
gave
her
all
the
animation
that
her
spirits
could
boast
;
for
she
was
in
*NL*
no
cheerful
humour
.
Mr.
Darcy
was
almost
as
far
from
her
as
the
table
*NL*
could
divide
them
.
He
was
on
one
side
of
her
mother
.
She
knew
how
little
*NL*
such
a
situation
would
give
pleasure
to
either
,
or
make
either
appear
to
*NL*
advantage
.
She
was
not
near
enough
to
hear
any
of
their
discourse
,
but
*NL*
she
could
see
how
seldom
they
spoke
to
each
other
,
and
how
formal
and
*NL*
cold
was
their
manner
whenever
they
did
.
Her
mother
's
ungraciousness
,
*NL*
made
the
sense
of
what
they
owed
him
more
painful
to
Elizabeth
's
mind
;
*NL*
and
she
would
,
at
times
,
have
given
anything
to
be
privileged
to
tell
*NL*
him
that
his
kindness
was
neither
unknown
nor
unfelt
by
the
whole
of
the
*NL*
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
hopes
that
the
evening
would
afford
some
opportunity
of
*NL*
bringing
them
together
;
that
the
whole
of
the
visit
would
not
pass
away
*NL*
without
enabling
them
to
enter
into
something
more
of
conversation
than
*NL*
the
mere
ceremonious
salutation
attending
his
entrance
.
Anxious
*NL*
and
uneasy
,
the
period
which
passed
in
the
drawing-room
,
before
the
*NL*
gentlemen
came
,
was
wearisome
and
dull
to
a
degree
that
almost
made
her
*NL*
uncivil
.
She
looked
forward
to
their
entrance
as
the
point
on
which
all
*NL*
her
chance
of
pleasure
for
the
evening
must
depend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
does
not
come
to
me
,
_
then
_
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
shall
give
him
up
for
*NL*
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentlemen
came
;
and
she
thought
he
looked
as
if
he
would
have
*NL*
answered
her
hopes
;
but
,
alas
!
the
ladies
had
crowded
round
the
table
,
*NL*
where
Miss
Bennet
was
making
tea
,
and
Elizabeth
pouring
out
the
coffee
,
*NL*
in
so
close
a
confederacy
that
there
was
not
a
single
vacancy
near
her
*NL*
which
would
admit
of
a
chair
.
And
on
the
gentlemen
's
approaching
,
one
of
*NL*
the
girls
moved
closer
to
her
than
ever
,
and
said
,
in
a
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
men
sha
n't
come
and
part
us
,
I
am
determined
.
We
want
none
of
them
;
*NL*
do
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darcy
had
walked
away
to
another
part
of
the
room
.
She
followed
him
with
*NL*
her
eyes
,
envied
everyone
to
whom
he
spoke
,
had
scarcely
patience
enough
*NL*
to
help
anybody
to
coffee
;
and
then
was
enraged
against
herself
for
*NL*
being
so
silly
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
who
has
once
been
refused
!
How
could
I
ever
be
foolish
enough
to
*NL*
expect
a
renewal
of
his
love
?
Is
there
one
among
the
sex
,
who
would
not
*NL*
protest
against
such
a
weakness
as
a
second
proposal
to
the
same
woman
?
*NL*
There
is
no
indignity
so
abhorrent
to
their
feelings
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
little
revived
,
however
,
by
his
bringing
back
his
coffee
cup
*NL*
himself
;
and
she
seized
the
opportunity
of
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
sister
at
Pemberley
still
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
will
remain
there
till
Christmas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
quite
alone
?
Have
all
her
friends
left
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Annesley
is
with
her
.
The
others
have
been
gone
on
to
Scarborough
,
*NL*
these
three
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
think
of
nothing
more
to
say
;
but
if
he
wished
to
converse
*NL*
with
her
,
he
might
have
better
success
.
He
stood
by
her
,
however
,
for
*NL*
some
minutes
,
in
silence
;
and
,
at
last
,
on
the
young
lady
's
whispering
*NL*
to
Elizabeth
again
,
he
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
tea-things
were
removed
,
and
the
card-tables
placed
,
the
ladies
*NL*
all
rose
,
and
Elizabeth
was
then
hoping
to
be
soon
joined
by
him
,
*NL*
when
all
her
views
were
overthrown
by
seeing
him
fall
a
victim
to
her
*NL*
mother
's
rapacity
for
whist
players
,
and
in
a
few
moments
after
seated
*NL*
with
the
rest
of
the
party
.
She
now
lost
every
expectation
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
They
were
confined
for
the
evening
at
different
tables
,
and
she
had
*NL*
nothing
to
hope
,
but
that
his
eyes
were
so
often
turned
towards
her
side
*NL*
of
the
room
,
as
to
make
him
play
as
unsuccessfully
as
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
had
designed
to
keep
the
two
Netherfield
gentlemen
to
*NL*
supper
;
but
their
carriage
was
unluckily
ordered
before
any
of
the
*NL*
others
,
and
she
had
no
opportunity
of
detaining
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
girls
,
''
said
she
,
as
soon
as
they
were
left
to
themselves
,
``
What
*NL*
say
you
to
the
day
?
I
think
every
thing
has
passed
off
uncommonly
well
,
*NL*
I
assure
you
.
The
dinner
was
as
well
dressed
as
any
I
ever
saw
.
The
*NL*
venison
was
roasted
to
a
turn
--
and
everybody
said
they
never
saw
so
*NL*
fat
a
haunch
.
The
soup
was
fifty
times
better
than
what
we
had
at
the
*NL*
Lucases
'
last
week
;
and
even
Mr.
Darcy
acknowledged
,
that
the
partridges
*NL*
were
remarkably
well
done
;
and
I
suppose
he
has
two
or
three
French
*NL*
cooks
at
least
.
And
,
my
dear
Jane
,
I
never
saw
you
look
in
greater
*NL*
beauty
.
Mrs.
Long
said
so
too
,
for
I
asked
her
whether
you
did
not
.
And
*NL*
what
do
you
think
she
said
besides
?
`
Ah
!
Mrs.
Bennet
,
we
shall
have
her
*NL*
at
Netherfield
at
last
.
'
She
did
indeed
.
I
do
think
Mrs.
Long
is
as
good
*NL*
a
creature
as
ever
lived
--
and
her
nieces
are
very
pretty
behaved
girls
,
*NL*
and
not
at
all
handsome
:
I
like
them
prodigiously
.

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
,
in
short
,
was
in
very
great
spirits
;
she
had
seen
enough
of
*NL*
Bingley
's
behaviour
to
Jane
,
to
be
convinced
that
she
would
get
him
at
*NL*
last
;
and
her
expectations
of
advantage
to
her
family
,
when
in
a
happy
*NL*
humour
,
were
so
far
beyond
reason
,
that
she
was
quite
disappointed
at
*NL*
not
seeing
him
there
again
the
next
day
,
to
make
his
proposals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
a
very
agreeable
day

''
said
Miss
Bennet
to
Elizabeth
.
``
The
*NL*
party
seemed
so
well
selected
,
so
suitable
one
with
the
other
.
I
hope
we
*NL*
may
often
meet
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizzy
,
you
must
not
do
so
.
You
must
not
suspect
me
.
It
mortifies
me
.
*NL*
I
assure
you
that
I
have
now
learnt
to
enjoy
his
conversation
as
an
*NL*
agreeable
and
sensible
young
man
,
without
having
a
wish
beyond
it
.
I
am
*NL*
perfectly
satisfied
,
from
what
his
manners
now
are
,
that
he
never
had
*NL*
any
design
of
engaging
my
affection
.
It
is
only
that
he
is
blessed
*NL*
with
greater
sweetness
of
address
,
and
a
stronger
desire
of
generally
*NL*
pleasing
,
than
any
other
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
cruel
,
''
said
her
sister
,
``
you
will
not
let
me
smile
,
and
*NL*
are
provoking
me
to
it
every
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
hard
it
is
in
some
cases
to
be
believed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
impossible
in
others
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
you
wish
to
persuade
me
that
I
feel
more
than
I
*NL*
acknowledge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
question
which
I
hardly
know
how
to
answer
.
We
all
love
to
*NL*
instruct
,
though
we
can
teach
only
what
is
not
worth
knowing
.
Forgive
*NL*
me
;
and
if
you
persist
in
indifference
,
do
not
make
me
your
confidante
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
after
this
visit
,
Mr.
Bingley
called
again
,
and
alone
.
His
*NL*
friend
had
left
him
that
morning
for
London
,
but
was
to
return
home
in
*NL*
ten
days
time
.
He
sat
with
them
above
an
hour
,
and
was
in
remarkably
*NL*
good
spirits
.
Mrs.
Bennet
invited
him
to
dine
with
them
;
but
,
with
many
*NL*
expressions
of
concern
,
he
confessed
himself
engaged
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
time
you
call
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
hope
we
shall
be
more
lucky
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
should
be
particularly
happy
at
any
time
,
etc.
etc.
;
and
if
she
would
*NL*
give
him
leave
,
would
take
an
early
opportunity
of
waiting
on
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
come
to-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
he
had
no
engagement
at
all
for
to-morrow
;
and
her
invitation
was
*NL*
accepted
with
alacrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
,
and
in
such
very
good
time
that
the
ladies
were
none
of
them
*NL*
dressed
.
In
ran
Mrs.
Bennet
to
her
daughter
's
room
,
in
her
dressing
*NL*
gown
,
and
with
her
hair
half
finished
,
crying
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Jane
,
make
haste
and
hurry
down
.
He
is
come
--
Mr.
Bingley
is
*NL*
come
.
He
is
,
indeed
.
Make
haste
,
make
haste
.
Here
,
Sarah
,
come
to
Miss
*NL*
Bennet
this
moment
,
and
help
her
on
with
her
gown
.
Never
mind
Miss
*NL*
Lizzy
's
hair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
be
down
as
soon
as
we
can
,
''
said
Jane
;
``
but
I
dare
say
Kitty
is
*NL*
forwarder
than
either
of
us
,
for
she
went
up
stairs
half
an
hour
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
hang
Kitty
!
what
has
she
to
do
with
it
?
Come
be
quick
,
be
quick
!
*NL*
Where
is
your
sash
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
her
mother
was
gone
,
Jane
would
not
be
prevailed
on
to
go
down
*NL*
without
one
of
her
sisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
anxiety
to
get
them
by
themselves
was
visible
again
in
the
*NL*
evening
.
After
tea
,
Mr.
Bennet
retired
to
the
library
,
as
was
his
*NL*
custom
,
and
Mary
went
up
stairs
to
her
instrument
.
Two
obstacles
of
*NL*
the
five
being
thus
removed
,
Mrs.
Bennet
sat
looking
and
winking
at
*NL*
Elizabeth
and
Catherine
for
a
considerable
time
,
without
making
any
*NL*
impression
on
them
.
Elizabeth
would
not
observe
her
;
and
when
at
last
*NL*
Kitty
did
,
she
very
innocently
said
,
``
What
is
the
matter
mamma
?
What
do
*NL*
you
keep
winking
at
me
for
?
What
am
I
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
child
,
nothing
.
I
did
not
wink
at
you
.
''
She
then
sat
still
*NL*
five
minutes
longer
;
but
unable
to
waste
such
a
precious
occasion
,
she
*NL*
suddenly
got
up
,
and
saying
to
Kitty
,
``
Come
here
,
my
love
,
I
want
to
*NL*
speak
to
you
,
''
took
her
out
of
the
room
.
Jane
instantly
gave
a
look
*NL*
at
Elizabeth
which
spoke
her
distress
at
such
premeditation
,
and
her
*NL*
entreaty
that
_
she
_
would
not
give
in
to
it
.
In
a
few
minutes
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
half-opened
the
door
and
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizzy
,
my
dear
,
I
want
to
speak
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
forced
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
may
as
well
leave
them
by
themselves
you
know
;
''
said
her
mother
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
was
in
the
hall
.
``
Kitty
and
I
are
going
up
stairs
to
sit
in
*NL*
my
dressing-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
made
no
attempt
to
reason
with
her
mother
,
but
remained
*NL*
quietly
in
the
hall
,
till
she
and
Kitty
were
out
of
sight
,
then
returned
*NL*
into
the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
's
schemes
for
this
day
were
ineffectual
.
Bingley
was
every
*NL*
thing
that
was
charming
,
except
the
professed
lover
of
her
daughter
.
His
*NL*
ease
and
cheerfulness
rendered
him
a
most
agreeable
addition
to
their
*NL*
evening
party
;
and
he
bore
with
the
ill-judged
officiousness
of
the
*NL*
mother
,
and
heard
all
her
silly
remarks
with
a
forbearance
and
command
*NL*
of
countenance
particularly
grateful
to
the
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
scarcely
needed
an
invitation
to
stay
supper
;
and
before
he
went
*NL*
away
,
an
engagement
was
formed
,
chiefly
through
his
own
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
's
means
,
for
his
coming
next
morning
to
shoot
with
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
day
,
Jane
said
no
more
of
her
indifference
.
Not
a
word
passed
*NL*
between
the
sisters
concerning
Bingley
;
but
Elizabeth
went
to
bed
in
*NL*
the
happy
belief
that
all
must
speedily
be
concluded
,
unless
Mr.
Darcy
*NL*
returned
within
the
stated
time
.
Seriously
,
however
,
she
felt
tolerably
*NL*
persuaded
that
all
this
must
have
taken
place
with
that
gentleman
's
*NL*
concurrence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bingley
was
punctual
to
his
appointment
;
and
he
and
Mr.
Bennet
spent
*NL*
the
morning
together
,
as
had
been
agreed
on
.
The
latter
was
much
more
*NL*
agreeable
than
his
companion
expected
.
There
was
nothing
of
presumption
*NL*
or
folly
in
Bingley
that
could
provoke
his
ridicule
,
or
disgust
him
into
*NL*
silence
;
and
he
was
more
communicative
,
and
less
eccentric
,
than
the
*NL*
other
had
ever
seen
him
.
Bingley
of
course
returned
with
him
to
dinner
;
*NL*
and
in
the
evening
Mrs.
Bennet
's
invention
was
again
at
work
to
get
*NL*
every
body
away
from
him
and
her
daughter
.
Elizabeth
,
who
had
a
letter
*NL*
to
write
,
went
into
the
breakfast
room
for
that
purpose
soon
after
tea
;
*NL*
for
as
the
others
were
all
going
to
sit
down
to
cards
,
she
could
not
be
*NL*
wanted
to
counteract
her
mother
's
schemes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
returning
to
the
drawing-room
,
when
her
letter
was
finished
,
she
*NL*
saw
,
to
her
infinite
surprise
,
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
her
mother
*NL*
had
been
too
ingenious
for
her
.
On
opening
the
door
,
she
perceived
her
*NL*
sister
and
Bingley
standing
together
over
the
hearth
,
as
if
engaged
in
*NL*
earnest
conversation
;
and
had
this
led
to
no
suspicion
,
the
faces
of
*NL*
both
,
as
they
hastily
turned
round
and
moved
away
from
each
other
,
would
*NL*
have
told
it
all
.
Their
situation
was
awkward
enough
;
but
_
hers
_
she
*NL*
thought
was
still
worse
.
Not
a
syllable
was
uttered
by
either
;
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
again
,
when
Bingley
,
who
as
*NL*
well
as
the
other
had
sat
down
,
suddenly
rose
,
and
whispering
a
few
*NL*
words
to
her
sister
,
ran
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
could
have
no
reserves
from
Elizabeth
,
where
confidence
would
give
*NL*
pleasure
;
and
instantly
embracing
her
,
acknowledged
,
with
the
liveliest
*NL*
emotion
,
that
she
was
the
happiest
creature
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
too
much
!
''
she
added
,
``
by
far
too
much
.
I
do
not
deserve
it
.
Oh
!
*NL*
why
is
not
everybody
as
happy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
congratulations
were
given
with
a
sincerity
,
a
warmth
,
*NL*
a
delight
,
which
words
could
but
poorly
express
.
Every
sentence
of
*NL*
kindness
was
a
fresh
source
of
happiness
to
Jane
.
But
she
would
not
*NL*
allow
herself
to
stay
with
her
sister
,
or
say
half
that
remained
to
be
*NL*
said
for
the
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
instantly
to
my
mother
;
''
she
cried
.
``
I
would
not
on
any
*NL*
account
trifle
with
her
affectionate
solicitude
;
or
allow
her
to
hear
it
*NL*
from
anyone
but
myself
.
He
is
gone
to
my
father
already
.
Oh
!
Lizzy
,
to
*NL*
know
that
what
I
have
to
relate
will
give
such
pleasure
to
all
my
dear
*NL*
family
!
how
shall
I
bear
so
much
happiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
hastened
away
to
her
mother
,
who
had
purposely
broken
up
the
*NL*
card
party
,
and
was
sitting
up
stairs
with
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
who
was
left
by
herself
,
now
smiled
at
the
rapidity
and
ease
*NL*
with
which
an
affair
was
finally
settled
,
that
had
given
them
so
many
*NL*
previous
months
of
suspense
and
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
,
''
said
she
,
``
is
the
end
of
all
his
friend
's
anxious
*NL*
circumspection
!
of
all
his
sister
's
falsehood
and
contrivance
!
the
*NL*
happiest
,
wisest
,
most
reasonable
end
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
she
was
joined
by
Bingley
,
whose
conference
with
her
*NL*
father
had
been
short
and
to
the
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
your
sister
?
''
said
he
hastily
,
as
he
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
my
mother
up
stairs
.
She
will
be
down
in
a
moment
,
I
dare
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
shut
the
door
,
and
,
coming
up
to
her
,
claimed
the
good
wishes
*NL*
and
affection
of
a
sister
.
Elizabeth
honestly
and
heartily
expressed
*NL*
her
delight
in
the
prospect
of
their
relationship
.
They
shook
hands
with
*NL*
great
cordiality
;
and
then
,
till
her
sister
came
down
,
she
had
to
listen
*NL*
to
all
he
had
to
say
of
his
own
happiness
,
and
of
Jane
's
perfections
;
*NL*
and
in
spite
of
his
being
a
lover
,
Elizabeth
really
believed
all
his
*NL*
expectations
of
felicity
to
be
rationally
founded
,
because
they
had
for
*NL*
basis
the
excellent
understanding
,
and
super-excellent
disposition
of
*NL*
Jane
,
and
a
general
similarity
of
feeling
and
taste
between
her
and
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
evening
of
no
common
delight
to
them
all
;
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
Miss
Bennet
's
mind
gave
a
glow
of
such
sweet
animation
to
her
face
,
as
*NL*
made
her
look
handsomer
than
ever
.
Kitty
simpered
and
smiled
,
and
hoped
*NL*
her
turn
was
coming
soon
.
Mrs.
Bennet
could
not
give
her
consent
or
*NL*
speak
her
approbation
in
terms
warm
enough
to
satisfy
her
feelings
,
*NL*
though
she
talked
to
Bingley
of
nothing
else
for
half
an
hour
;
and
when
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
joined
them
at
supper
,
his
voice
and
manner
plainly
showed
*NL*
how
really
happy
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
word
,
however
,
passed
his
lips
in
allusion
to
it
,
till
their
*NL*
visitor
took
his
leave
for
the
night
;
but
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
he
*NL*
turned
to
his
daughter
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
,
I
congratulate
you
.
You
will
be
a
very
happy
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
went
to
him
instantly
,
kissed
him
,
and
thanked
him
for
his
*NL*
goodness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
good
girl
;
''
he
replied
,
``
and
I
have
great
pleasure
in
*NL*
thinking
you
will
be
so
happily
settled
.
I
have
not
a
doubt
of
your
*NL*
doing
very
well
together
.
Your
tempers
are
by
no
means
unlike
.
You
are
*NL*
each
of
you
so
complying
,
that
nothing
will
ever
be
resolved
on
;
so
*NL*
easy
,
that
every
servant
will
cheat
you
;
and
so
generous
,
that
you
will
*NL*
always
exceed
your
income
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
so
.
Imprudence
or
thoughtlessness
in
money
matters
would
be
*NL*
unpardonable
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exceed
their
income
!
My
dear
Mr.
Bennet
,
''
cried
his
wife
,
``
what
are
you
*NL*
talking
of
?
Why
,
he
has
four
or
five
thousand
a
year
,
and
very
likely
*NL*
more
.
''
Then
addressing
her
daughter
,
``
Oh
!
my
dear
,
dear
Jane
,
I
am
so
*NL*
happy
!
I
am
sure
I
sha
n't
get
a
wink
of
sleep
all
night
.
I
knew
how
it
*NL*
would
be
.
I
always
said
it
must
be
so
,
at
last
.
I
was
sure
you
could
not
*NL*
be
so
beautiful
for
nothing
!
I
remember
,
as
soon
as
ever
I
saw
him
,
when
*NL*
he
first
came
into
Hertfordshire
last
year
,
I
thought
how
likely
it
was
*NL*
that
you
should
come
together
.
Oh
!
he
is
the
handsomest
young
man
that
*NL*
ever
was
seen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wickham
,
Lydia
,
were
all
forgotten
.
Jane
was
beyond
competition
her
*NL*
favourite
child
.
At
that
moment
,
she
cared
for
no
other
.
Her
younger
*NL*
sisters
soon
began
to
make
interest
with
her
for
objects
of
happiness
*NL*
which
she
might
in
future
be
able
to
dispense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
petitioned
for
the
use
of
the
library
at
Netherfield
;
and
Kitty
*NL*
begged
very
hard
for
a
few
balls
there
every
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bingley
,
from
this
time
,
was
of
course
a
daily
visitor
at
Longbourn
;
*NL*
coming
frequently
before
breakfast
,
and
always
remaining
till
after
*NL*
supper
;
unless
when
some
barbarous
neighbour
,
who
could
not
be
enough
*NL*
detested
,
had
given
him
an
invitation
to
dinner
which
he
thought
himself
*NL*
obliged
to
accept
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
now
but
little
time
for
conversation
with
her
sister
;
for
*NL*
while
he
was
present
,
Jane
had
no
attention
to
bestow
on
anyone
else
;
*NL*
but
she
found
herself
considerably
useful
to
both
of
them
in
those
hours
*NL*
of
separation
that
must
sometimes
occur
.
In
the
absence
of
Jane
,
he
*NL*
always
attached
himself
to
Elizabeth
,
for
the
pleasure
of
talking
of
*NL*
her
;
and
when
Bingley
was
gone
,
Jane
constantly
sought
the
same
means
of
*NL*
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
made
me
so
happy
,
''
said
she
,
one
evening
,
``
by
telling
me
that
he
*NL*
was
totally
ignorant
of
my
being
in
town
last
spring
!
I
had
not
believed
*NL*
it
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspected
as
much
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
.
``
But
how
did
he
account
for
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
have
been
his
sister
's
doing
.
They
were
certainly
no
friends
to
*NL*
his
acquaintance
with
me
,
which
I
can
not
wonder
at
,
since
he
might
have
*NL*
chosen
so
much
more
advantageously
in
many
respects
.
But
when
they
see
,
*NL*
as
I
trust
they
will
,
that
their
brother
is
happy
with
me
,
they
will
*NL*
learn
to
be
contented
,
and
we
shall
be
on
good
terms
again
;
though
we
*NL*
can
never
be
what
we
once
were
to
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
most
unforgiving
speech
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
that
I
ever
*NL*
heard
you
utter
.
Good
girl
!
It
would
vex
me
,
indeed
,
to
see
you
again
*NL*
the
dupe
of
Miss
Bingley
's
pretended
regard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
believe
it
,
Lizzy
,
that
when
he
went
to
town
last
November
,
*NL*
he
really
loved
me
,
and
nothing
but
a
persuasion
of
_
my
_
being
*NL*
indifferent
would
have
prevented
his
coming
down
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
made
a
little
mistake
to
be
sure
;
but
it
is
to
the
credit
of
his
*NL*
modesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
naturally
introduced
a
panegyric
from
Jane
on
his
diffidence
,
and
*NL*
the
little
value
he
put
on
his
own
good
qualities
.
Elizabeth
was
pleased
*NL*
to
find
that
he
had
not
betrayed
the
interference
of
his
friend
;
for
,
*NL*
though
Jane
had
the
most
generous
and
forgiving
heart
in
the
world
,
she
*NL*
knew
it
was
a
circumstance
which
must
prejudice
her
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
certainly
the
most
fortunate
creature
that
ever
existed
!
''
cried
*NL*
Jane
.
``
Oh
!
Lizzy
,
why
am
I
thus
singled
from
my
family
,
and
blessed
*NL*
above
them
all
!
If
I
could
but
see
_
you
_
as
happy
!
If
there
_
were
_
but
*NL*
such
another
man
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
to
give
me
forty
such
men
,
I
never
could
be
so
happy
as

you

Till
I
have
your
disposition
,
your
goodness
,
I
never
can
have
your
*NL*
happiness

No

no

let
me
shift
for
myself
;
and
,
perhaps
,
if
I
have
very
*NL*
good
luck

I
may
meet
with
another
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
of
affairs
in
the
Longbourn
family
could
not
be
long
a
*NL*
secret
.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
privileged
to
whisper
it
to
Mrs.
Phillips
,
*NL*
and
she
ventured
,
without
any
permission
,
to
do
the
same
by
all
her
*NL*
neighbours
in
Meryton
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bennets
were
speedily
pronounced
to
be
the
luckiest
family
in
the
*NL*
world
,
though
only
a
few
weeks
before
,
when
Lydia
had
first
run
away
,
*NL*
they
had
been
generally
proved
to
be
marked
out
for
misfortune
.

Chapter
56
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
about
a
week
after
Bingley
's
engagement
with
Jane
had
been
*NL*
formed
,
as
he
and
the
females
of
the
family
were
sitting
together
in
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
their
attention
was
suddenly
drawn
to
the
window
,
by
the
*NL*
sound
of
a
carriage
;
and
they
perceived
a
chaise
and
four
driving
up
*NL*
the
lawn
.
It
was
too
early
in
the
morning
for
visitors
,
and
besides
,
the
*NL*
equipage
did
not
answer
to
that
of
any
of
their
neighbours
.
The
horses
*NL*
were
post
;
and
neither
the
carriage
,
nor
the
livery
of
the
servant
who
*NL*
preceded
it
,
were
familiar
to
them
.
As
it
was
certain
,
however
,
that
*NL*
somebody
was
coming
,
Bingley
instantly
prevailed
on
Miss
Bennet
to
avoid
*NL*
the
confinement
of
such
an
intrusion
,
and
walk
away
with
him
into
the
*NL*
shrubbery
.
They
both
set
off
,
and
the
conjectures
of
the
remaining
three
*NL*
continued
,
though
with
little
satisfaction
,
till
the
door
was
thrown
*NL*
open
and
their
visitor
entered
.
It
was
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
of
course
all
intending
to
be
surprised
;
but
their
*NL*
astonishment
was
beyond
their
expectation
;
and
on
the
part
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Bennet
and
Kitty
,
though
she
was
perfectly
unknown
to
them
,
even
*NL*
inferior
to
what
Elizabeth
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
entered
the
room
with
an
air
more
than
usually
ungracious
,
made
no
*NL*
other
reply
to
Elizabeth
's
salutation
than
a
slight
inclination
of
the
*NL*
head
,
and
sat
down
without
saying
a
word
.
Elizabeth
had
mentioned
her
*NL*
name
to
her
mother
on
her
ladyship
's
entrance
,
though
no
request
of
*NL*
introduction
had
been
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
,
all
amazement
,
though
flattered
by
having
a
guest
of
such
*NL*
high
importance
,
received
her
with
the
utmost
politeness
.
After
sitting
*NL*
for
a
moment
in
silence
,
she
said
very
stiffly
to
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
are
well
,
Miss
Bennet
.
That
lady
,
I
suppose
,
is
your
*NL*
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
replied
very
concisely
that
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
_
that
_
I
suppose
is
one
of
your
sisters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madam
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bennet
,
delighted
to
speak
to
Lady
Catherine
.
*NL*
``
She
is
my
youngest
girl
but
one
.
My
youngest
of
all
is
lately
married
,
*NL*
and
my
eldest
is
somewhere
about
the
grounds
,
walking
with
a
young
man
*NL*
who
,
I
believe
,
will
soon
become
a
part
of
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
very
small
park
here
,
''
returned
Lady
Catherine
after
a
short
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
nothing
in
comparison
of
Rosings
,
my
lady
,
I
dare
say
;
but
I
*NL*
assure
you
it
is
much
larger
than
Sir
William
Lucas
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
must
be
a
most
inconvenient
sitting
room
for
the
evening
,
in
*NL*
summer
;
the
windows
are
full
west
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
assured
her
that
they
never
sat
there
after
dinner
,
and
then
*NL*
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
take
the
liberty
of
asking
your
ladyship
whether
you
left
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Collins
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
well
.
I
saw
them
the
night
before
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
now
expected
that
she
would
produce
a
letter
for
her
from
*NL*
Charlotte
,
as
it
seemed
the
only
probable
motive
for
her
calling
.
But
no
*NL*
letter
appeared
,
and
she
was
completely
puzzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bennet
,
with
great
civility
,
begged
her
ladyship
to
take
some
*NL*
refreshment
;
but
Lady
Catherine
very
resolutely
,
and
not
very
politely
,
*NL*
declined
eating
anything
;
and
then
,
rising
up
,
said
to
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Bennet
,
there
seemed
to
be
a
prettyish
kind
of
a
little
wilderness
*NL*
on
one
side
of
your
lawn
.
I
should
be
glad
to
take
a
turn
in
it
,
if
you
*NL*
will
favour
me
with
your
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
my
dear
,
''
cried
her
mother
,
``
and
show
her
ladyship
about
the
*NL*
different
walks
.
I
think
she
will
be
pleased
with
the
hermitage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
obeyed
,
and
running
into
her
own
room
for
her
parasol
,
*NL*
attended
her
noble
guest
downstairs
.
As
they
passed
through
the
*NL*
hall
,
Lady
Catherine
opened
the
doors
into
the
dining-parlour
and
*NL*
drawing-room
,
and
pronouncing
them
,
after
a
short
survey
,
to
be
decent
*NL*
looking
rooms
,
walked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
carriage
remained
at
the
door
,
and
Elizabeth
saw
that
her
*NL*
waiting-woman
was
in
it
.
They
proceeded
in
silence
along
the
gravel
walk
*NL*
that
led
to
the
copse
;
Elizabeth
was
determined
to
make
no
effort
for
*NL*
conversation
with
a
woman
who
was
now
more
than
usually
insolent
and
*NL*
disagreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
ever
think
her
like
her
nephew
?
''
said
she
,
as
she
looked
in
*NL*
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
entered
the
copse
,
Lady
Catherine
began
in
the
following
*NL*
manner
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
be
at
no
loss
,
Miss
Bennet
,
to
understand
the
reason
of
my
*NL*
journey
hither
.
Your
own
heart
,
your
own
conscience
,
must
tell
you
why
I
*NL*
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
looked
with
unaffected
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
you
are
mistaken
,
Madam
.
I
have
not
been
at
all
able
to
account
*NL*
for
the
honour
of
seeing
you
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Bennet
,
''
replied
her
ladyship
,
in
an
angry
tone
,
``
you
ought
to
*NL*
know
,
that
I
am
not
to
be
trifled
with
.
But
however
insincere
_
you
_
may
*NL*
choose
to
be
,
you
shall
not
find
_
me
_
so
.
My
character
has
ever
been
*NL*
celebrated
for
its
sincerity
and
frankness
,
and
in
a
cause
of
such
*NL*
moment
as
this
,
I
shall
certainly
not
depart
from
it
.
A
report
of
a
most
*NL*
alarming
nature
reached
me
two
days
ago
.
I
was
told
that
not
only
your
*NL*
sister
was
on
the
point
of
being
most
advantageously
married
,
but
that
*NL*
you
,
that
Miss
Elizabeth
Bennet
,
would
,
in
all
likelihood
,
be
soon
*NL*
afterwards
united
to
my
nephew
,
my
own
nephew
,
Mr.
Darcy

Though
I
*NL*
_
know
_
it
must
be
a
scandalous
falsehood
,
though
I
would
not
injure
him
*NL*
so
much
as
to
suppose
the
truth
of
it
possible
,
I
instantly
resolved
*NL*
on
setting
off
for
this
place
,
that
I
might
make
my
sentiments
known
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
believed
it
impossible
to
be
true

said
Elizabeth
,
colouring
*NL*
with
astonishment
and
disdain
,
``
I
wonder
you
took
the
trouble
of
coming
*NL*
so
far
.
What
could
your
ladyship
propose
by
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
once

insist

contradicted

*NL*
``
Your
coming

Longbourn

to
see
me
and
my
family

said
Elizabeth
*NL*
coolly
,
``
will
be
rather
a
confirmation
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

you
then
pretend

industriously
circulated

yourselves

Do
you
not
know
that
such
a

report
is
spread
abroad

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
heard

And

you
likewise
declare

is
no
foundation

But
your
arts

allurements
may

in
a
moment
of
infatuation

*NL*
have
made
him
forget
what
he
owes
to
himself

all
his

may
have
drawn
him
in

*NL*
``
If

do
you
know

not

Lady

hesitated
for

their
infancy
,
*NL*
they
have
been
intended
for
each
other
.
It
was
the
favourite
wish
of
*NL*
_
his
_
mother
,
as
well
as
of
hers
.
While
in
their
cradles
,
we
planned
*NL*
the
union
:
and
now
,
at
the
moment
when
the
wishes
of
both
sisters
would
*NL*
be
accomplished
in
their
marriage
,
to
be
prevented
by
a
young
woman
of
*NL*
inferior
birth
,
of
no
importance
in
the
world
,
and
wholly
unallied
to
*NL*
the
family
!
Do
you
pay
no
regard
to
the
wishes
of
his
friends
?
To
his
*NL*
tacit
engagement
with
Miss
de
Bourgh
?
Are
you
lost
to
every
feeling
of
*NL*
propriety
and
delicacy
?
Have
you
not
heard
me
say
that
from
his
earliest
*NL*
hours
he
was
destined
for
his
cousin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
had
heard
it
before

But
what
is
that
to
me
?
If
there
is
*NL*
no
other
objection
to
my
marrying
your
nephew
,
I
shall
certainly
not
*NL*
be
kept
from
it
by
knowing
that
his
mother
and
aunt
wished
him
to
*NL*
marry
Miss
de
Bourgh
.
You
both
did
as
much
as
you
could
in
planning
the
*NL*
marriage
.
Its
completion
depended
on
others
.
If
Mr.
Darcy
is
neither
*NL*
by
honour
nor
inclination
confined
to
his
cousin
,
why
is
not
he
to
make
*NL*
another
choice
?
And
if
I
am
that
choice
,
why
may
not
I
accept
him
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
honour

decorum

forbid
it

Yes

*NL*
Miss
Bennet

for
do
not
expect
to
be
noticed
by
his

friends

if
you
wilfully
act
against
the
inclinations
of
all

You
will

be
censured

slighted

despised

by
everyone
connected
with

Your

never

*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
heavy
misfortunes

replied
Elizabeth
.
``

*NL*
*NL*

Let

sit
down

You

*NL*
*NL*

I

Hear
me

My

They
are
descended

on

Their

splendid

the
voice

every

what
is

*NL*
The
upstart
pretensions

Is
this
to
be
endured

But
it

not

been
brought
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

she

*NL*
Elizabeth
made

and
without
attempting

persuade

walked
quietly
into
it
herself

She
*NL*
heard
the
carriage
drive
away
as
she
proceeded
up
stairs

Her
mother
*NL*
impatiently
met
her
at
the
door

dressing-room

to
ask
why

would
not
come
in
again

rest
herself

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
She

*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
forced
to
give
into

falsehood

to

The
discomposure
of
spirits
which
this
extraordinary
visit
threw
*NL*
Elizabeth
into
,
could
not
be
easily
overcome
;
nor
could
she
,
for
many
*NL*
hours
,
learn
to
think
of
it
less
than
incessantly
.
Lady
Catherine
,
it
*NL*
appeared
,
had
actually
taken
the
trouble
of
this
journey
from
Rosings
,
*NL*
for
the
sole
purpose
of
breaking
off
her
supposed
engagement
with
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
.
It
was
a
rational
scheme
,
to
be
sure
!
but
from
what
the
report
*NL*
of
their
engagement
could
originate
,
Elizabeth
was
at
a
loss
to
imagine
;
*NL*
till
she
recollected
that
_
his
_
being
the
intimate
friend
of
Bingley
,
*NL*
and
_
her
_
being
the
sister
of
Jane
,
was
enough
,
at
a
time
when
the
*NL*
expectation
of
one
wedding
made
everybody
eager
for
another
,
to
supply
*NL*
the
idea
.
She
had
not
herself
forgotten
to
feel
that
the
marriage
of
her
*NL*
sister
must
bring
them
more
frequently
together
.
And
her
neighbours
*NL*
at
Lucas
Lodge
,
therefore
-LRB-
for
through
their
communication
with
the
*NL*
Collinses
,
the
report
,
she
concluded
,
had
reached
Lady
Catherine
-RRB-
,
had
*NL*
only
set
that
down
as
almost
certain
and
immediate
,
which
she
had
looked
*NL*
forward
to
as
possible
at
some
future
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
revolving
Lady
Catherine
's
expressions
,
however
,
she
could
not
help
*NL*
feeling
some
uneasiness
as
to
the
possible
consequence
of
her
persisting
*NL*
in
this
interference
.
From
what
she
had
said
of
her
resolution
to
*NL*
prevent
their
marriage
,
it
occurred
to
Elizabeth
that
she
must
meditate
*NL*
an
application
to
her
nephew
;
and
how
_
he
_
might
take
a
similar
*NL*
representation
of
the
evils
attached
to
a
connection
with
her
,
she
dared
*NL*
not
pronounce
.
She
knew
not
the
exact
degree
of
his
affection
for
his
*NL*
aunt
,
or
his
dependence
on
her
judgment
,
but
it
was
natural
to
suppose
*NL*
that
he
thought
much
higher
of
her
ladyship
than
_
she
_
could
do
;
and
it
*NL*
was
certain
that
,
in
enumerating
the
miseries
of
a
marriage
with
_
one
_
,
*NL*
whose
immediate
connections
were
so
unequal
to
his
own
,
his
aunt
would
*NL*
address
him
on
his
weakest
side
.
With
his
notions
of
dignity
,
he
would
*NL*
probably
feel
that
the
arguments
,
which
to
Elizabeth
had
appeared
weak
*NL*
and
ridiculous
,
contained
much
good
sense
and
solid
reasoning
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
had
been
wavering
before
as
to
what
he
should
do
,
which
had
often
*NL*
seemed
likely
,
the
advice
and
entreaty
of
so
near
a
relation
might
*NL*
settle
every
doubt
,
and
determine
him
at
once
to
be
as
happy
as
dignity
*NL*
unblemished
could
make
him
.
In
that
case
he
would
return
no
more
.
Lady
*NL*
Catherine
might
see
him
in
her
way
through
town
;
and
his
engagement
to
*NL*
Bingley
of
coming
again
to
Netherfield
must
give
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
,
therefore
,
an
excuse
for
not
keeping
his
promise
should
come
to
his
*NL*
friend
within
a
few
days
,
''
she
added
,
``
I
shall
know
how
to
understand
*NL*
it
.
I
shall
then
give
over
every
expectation
,
every
wish
of
his
*NL*
constancy
.
If
he
is
satisfied
with
only
regretting
me
,
when
he
might
*NL*
have
obtained
my
affections
and
hand
,
I
shall
soon
cease
to

The
surprise
of
the
rest
of
the
family
,
on
hearing
who
their
visitor
had
*NL*
been
,
was
very
great
;
but
they
obligingly
satisfied
it
,
with
the
same
*NL*
kind
of
supposition
which
had
appeased
Mrs.
Bennet
's
curiosity
;
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
spared
from
much
teasing
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
as
she
was
going
downstairs
,
she
was
met
by
her
*NL*
father
,
who
came
out
of
his
library
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizzy
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
was
going
to
look
for
you
;
come
into
my
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
him
thither
;
and
her
curiosity
to
know
what
he
had
to
*NL*
tell
her
was
heightened
by
the
supposition
of
its
being
in
some
manner
*NL*
connected
with
the
letter
he
held
.
It
suddenly
struck
her
that
it
*NL*
might
be
from
Lady
Catherine
;
and
she
anticipated
with
dismay
all
the
*NL*
consequent
explanations
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
her
father
to
the
fire
place
,
and
they
both
sat
down
.
He
*NL*
then
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
received
a
letter
this
morning
that
has
astonished
me
*NL*
exceedingly
.
As
it
principally
concerns
yourself
,
you
ought
to
know
its
*NL*
contents
.
I
did
not
know
before
,
that
I
had
two
daughters
on
the
brink
*NL*
of
matrimony
.
Let
me
congratulate
you
on
a
very
important
conquest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
colour
now
rushed
into
Elizabeth
's
cheeks
in
the
instantaneous
*NL*
conviction
of
its
being
a
letter
from
the
nephew
,
instead
of
the
aunt
;
*NL*
and
she
was
undetermined
whether
most
to
be
pleased
that
he
explained
*NL*
himself
at
all
,
or
offended
that
his
letter
was
not
rather
addressed
to
*NL*
herself
;
when
her
father
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
conscious
.
Young
ladies
have
great
penetration
in
such
matters
*NL*
as
these
;
but
I
think
I
may
defy
even
_
your
_
sagacity
,
to
discover
the
*NL*
name
of
your
admirer
.
This
letter
is
from
Mr.
Collins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Mr.
Collins
!
and
what
can
_
he
_
have
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
very
much
to
the
purpose
of
course
.
He
begins
with
*NL*
congratulations
on
the
approaching
nuptials
of
my
eldest
daughter
,
of
*NL*
which
,
it
seems
,
he
has
been
told
by
some
of
the
good-natured
,
gossiping
*NL*
Lucases
.
I
shall
not
sport
with
your
impatience
,
by
reading
what
he
says
*NL*
on
that
point
.
What
relates
to
yourself
,
is
as
follows
:
`
Having
thus
*NL*
offered
you
the
sincere
congratulations
of
Mrs.
Collins
and
myself
on
*NL*
this
happy
event
,
let
me
now
add
a
short
hint
on
the
subject
of
another
;
*NL*
of
which
we
have
been
advertised
by
the
same
authority
.
Your
daughter
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
it
is
presumed
,
will
not
long
bear
the
name
of
Bennet
,
after
*NL*
her
elder
sister
has
resigned
it
,
and
the
chosen
partner
of
her
fate
may
*NL*
be
reasonably
looked
up
to
as
one
of
the
most
illustrious
personages
in
*NL*
this
land
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
possibly
guess
,
Lizzy
,
who
is
meant
by
this
?
`
This
young
*NL*
gentleman
is
blessed
,
in
a
peculiar
way
,
with
every
thing
the
heart
of
*NL*
mortal
can
most
desire
,
--
splendid
property
,
noble
kindred
,
and
extensive
*NL*
patronage
.
Yet
in
spite
of
all
these
temptations
,
let
me
warn
my
cousin
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
and
yourself
,
of
what
evils
you
may
incur
by
a
precipitate
*NL*
closure
with
this
gentleman
's
proposals
,
which
,
of
course
,
you
will
be
*NL*
inclined
to
take
immediate
advantage

``
Have
you
any
idea

Lizzy

who
this
gentleman
is
?
But
now
it
comes
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
My
motive
for
cautioning
you
is
as
follows
.
We
have
reason
to
imagine
*NL*
that
his
aunt
,
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
,
does
not
look
on
the
match
with
*NL*
a
friendly
eye
.

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Mr.
Darcy
_
,
you
see
,
is
the
man
!
Now
,
Lizzy
,
I
think
I
_
have
_
*NL*
surprised
you
.
Could
he
,
or
the
Lucases
,
have
pitched
on
any
man
within
*NL*
the
circle
of
our
acquaintance
,
whose
name
would
have
given
the
lie
*NL*
more
effectually
to
what
they
related
?
Mr.
Darcy
,
who
never
looks
at
any
*NL*
woman
but
to
see
a
blemish
,
and
who
probably
never
looked
at
you
in
his
*NL*
life
!
It
is
admirable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
tried
to
join
in
her
father
's
pleasantry
,
but
could
only
force
*NL*
one
most
reluctant
smile
.
Never
had
his
wit
been
directed
in
a
manner
so
*NL*
little
agreeable
to
her
.

Are

``
Oh

''
`
After
mentioning
the
likelihood
of
this
marriage
to
her
ladyship
last
*NL*
night
,
she
immediately
,
with
her
usual
condescension
,
expressed
what
she
*NL*
felt
on
the
occasion
;
when
it
became
apparent
,
that
on
the
score
of
some
*NL*
family
objections
on
the
part
of
my
cousin
,
she
would
never
give
her
*NL*
consent
to
what
she
termed
so
disgraceful
a
match
.
I
thought
it
my
duty
*NL*
to
give
the
speediest
intelligence
of
this
to
my
cousin
,
that
she
and
*NL*
her
noble
admirer
may
be
aware
of
what
they
are
about
,
and
not
run
*NL*
hastily
into
a
marriage
which
has
not
been
properly
sanctioned
.
'
Mr.
*NL*
Collins
moreover
adds
,
'
I
am
truly
rejoiced
that
my
cousin
Lydia
's
sad
*NL*
business
has
been
so
well
hushed
up
,
and
am
only
concerned
that
their
*NL*
living
together
before
the
marriage
took
place
should
be
so
generally
*NL*
known
.
I
must
not
,
however
,
neglect
the
duties
of
my
station
,
or
refrain
*NL*
from
declaring
my
amazement
at
hearing
that
you
received
the
young
*NL*
couple
into
your
house
as
soon
as
they
were
married
.
It
was
an
*NL*
encouragement
of
vice
;
and
had
I
been
the
rector
of
Longbourn
,
I
should
*NL*
very
strenuously
have
opposed
it
.
You
ought
certainly
to
forgive
them
,
*NL*
as
a
Christian
,
but
never
to
admit
them
in
your
sight
,
or
allow
their
*NL*
names
to
be
mentioned
in
your
hearing
.
'
That
is
his
notion
of
Christian
*NL*
forgiveness
!
The
rest
of
his
letter
is
only
about
his
dear
Charlotte
's
*NL*
situation
,
and
his
expectation
of
a
young
olive-branch
.
But
,
Lizzy
,
you
*NL*
look
as
if
you
did
not
enjoy
it
.
You
are
not
going
to
be
_
missish
_
,
*NL*
I
hope
,
and
pretend
to
be
affronted
at
an
idle
report
.
For
what
do
we
*NL*
live
,
but
to
make
sport
for
our
neighbours
,
and
laugh
at
them
in
our
*NL*
turn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
cried
Elizabeth
,
``
I
am
excessively
diverted
.
But
it
is
so
*NL*
strange
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
_
that
_
is
what
makes
it
amusing
.
Had
they
fixed
on
any
other
man
*NL*
it
would
have
been
nothing
;
but
_
his
_
perfect
indifference
,
and
_
your
_
*NL*
pointed
dislike
,
make
it
so
delightfully
absurd
!
Much
as
I
abominate
*NL*
writing
,
I
would
not
give
up
Mr.
Collins
's
correspondence
for
any
*NL*
consideration
.
Nay
,
when
I
read
a
letter
of
his
,
I
can
not
help
giving
*NL*
him
the
preference
even
over
Wickham
,
much
as
I
value
the
impudence
and
*NL*
hypocrisy
of
my
son-in-law
.
And
pray
,
Lizzy
,
what
said
Lady
Catherine
*NL*
about
this
report
?
Did
she
call
to
refuse
her
consent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
question
his
daughter
replied
only
with
a
laugh
;
and
as
it
had
*NL*
been
asked
without
the
least
suspicion
,
she
was
not
distressed
by
*NL*
his
repeating
it
.
Elizabeth
had
never
been
more
at
a
loss
to
make
her
*NL*
feelings
appear
what
they
were
not
.
It
was
necessary
to
laugh
,
when
she
*NL*
would
rather
have
cried
.
Her
father
had
most
cruelly
mortified
her
,
by
*NL*
what
he
said
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
indifference
,
and
she
could
do
nothing
but
*NL*
wonder
at
such
a
want
of
penetration
,
or
fear
that
perhaps
,
instead
of
*NL*
his
seeing
too
little
,
she
might
have
fancied
too
much
.

Instead
of
receiving
any
such
letter
of
excuse
from
his
friend
,
as
*NL*
Elizabeth
half
expected
Mr.
Bingley
to
do
,
he
was
able
to
bring
Darcy
*NL*
with
him
to
Longbourn
before
many
days
had
passed
after
Lady
Catherine
's
*NL*
visit
.
The
gentlemen
arrived
early
;
and
,
before
Mrs.
Bennet
had
time
*NL*
to
tell
him
of
their
having
seen
his
aunt
,
of
which
her
daughter
sat
*NL*
in
momentary
dread
,
Bingley
,
who
wanted
to
be
alone
with
Jane
,
proposed
*NL*
their
all
walking
out
.
It
was
agreed
to
.
Mrs.
Bennet
was
not
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
walking
;
Mary
could
never
spare
time
;
but
the
remaining
five
*NL*
set
off
together
.
Bingley
and
Jane
,
however
,
soon
allowed
the
others
*NL*
to
outstrip
them
.
They
lagged
behind
,
while
Elizabeth
,
Kitty
,
and
Darcy
*NL*
were
to
entertain
each
other
.
Very
little
was
said
by
either
;
Kitty
*NL*
was
too
much
afraid
of
him
to
talk
;
Elizabeth
was
secretly
forming
a
*NL*
desperate
resolution
;
and
perhaps
he
might
be
doing
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
towards
the
Lucases
,
because
Kitty
wished
to
call
upon
*NL*
Maria
;
and
as
Elizabeth
saw
no
occasion
for
making
it
a
general
concern
,
*NL*
when
Kitty
left
them
she
went
boldly
on
with
him
alone
.
Now
was
the
*NL*
moment
for
her
resolution
to
be
executed
,
and
,
while
her
courage
was
*NL*
high
,
she
immediately
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Darcy
,
I
am
a
very
selfish
creature
;
and
,
for
the
sake
of
giving
*NL*
relief
to
my
own
feelings
,
care
not
how
much
I
may
be
wounding
yours
.
I
*NL*
can
no
longer
help
thanking
you
for
your
unexampled
kindness
to
my
*NL*
poor
sister
.
Ever
since
I
have
known
it
,
I
have
been
most
anxious
to
*NL*
acknowledge
to
you
how
gratefully
I
feel
it
.
Were
it
known
to
the
rest
*NL*
of
my
family
,
I
should
not
have
merely
my
own
gratitude
to
express
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
exceedingly
sorry
,
''
replied
Darcy
,
in
a
tone
of
surprise
*NL*
and
emotion
,
``
that
you
have
ever
been
informed
of
what
may
,
in
a
*NL*
mistaken
light
,
have
given
you
uneasiness
.
I
did
not
think
Mrs.
Gardiner
*NL*
was
so
little
to
be
trusted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
blame
my
aunt
.
Lydia
's
thoughtlessness
first
betrayed
to
*NL*
me
that
you
had
been
concerned
in
the
matter
;
and
,
of
course
,
I
could
*NL*
not
rest
till
I
knew
the
particulars
.
Let
me
thank
you
again
and
again
,
*NL*
in
the
name
of
all
my
family
,
for
that
generous
compassion
which
induced
*NL*
you
to
take
so
much
trouble
,
and
bear
so
many
mortifications
,
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
discovering
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
_
will
_
thank
me
,
''
he
replied
,
``
let
it
be
for
yourself
alone
.
*NL*
That
the
wish
of
giving
happiness
to
you
might
add
force
to
the
other
*NL*
inducements
which
led
me
on
,
I
shall
not
attempt
to
deny
.
But
your
*NL*
_
family
_
owe
me
nothing
.
Much
as
I
respect
them
,
I
believe
I
thought
*NL*
only
of
_
you
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
too
much
embarrassed
to
say
a
word
.
After
a
short
pause
,
*NL*
her
companion
added
,
``
You
are
too
generous
to
trifle
with
me
.
If
your
*NL*
feelings
are
still
what
they
were
last
April
,
tell
me
so
at
once
.
_
My
_
*NL*
affections
and
wishes
are
unchanged
,
but
one
word
from
you
will
silence
*NL*
me
on
this
subject
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
feeling
all
the
more
than
common
awkwardness
and
anxiety
of
*NL*
his
situation
,
now
forced
herself
to
speak
;
and
immediately
,
though
not
*NL*
very
fluently
,
gave
him
to
understand
that
her
sentiments
had
undergone
*NL*
so
material
a
change
,
since
the
period
to
which
he
alluded
,
as
to
make
*NL*
her
receive
with
gratitude
and
pleasure
his
present
assurances
.
The
*NL*
happiness
which
this
reply
produced
,
was
such
as
he
had
probably
never
*NL*
felt
before
;
and
he
expressed
himself
on
the
occasion
as
sensibly
and
as
*NL*
warmly
as
a
man
violently
in
love
can
be
supposed
to
do
.
Had
Elizabeth
*NL*
been
able
to
encounter
his
eye
,
she
might
have
seen
how
well
the
*NL*
expression
of
heartfelt
delight
,
diffused
over
his
face
,
became
him
;
*NL*
but
,
though
she
could
not
look
,
she
could
listen
,
and
he
told
her
of
*NL*
feelings
,
which
,
in
proving
of
what
importance
she
was
to
him
,
made
his
*NL*
affection
every
moment
more
valuable
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
on
,
without
knowing
in
what
direction
.
There
was
too
much
to
*NL*
be
thought
,
and
felt
,
and
said
,
for
attention
to
any
other
objects
.
She
*NL*
soon
learnt
that
they
were
indebted
for
their
present
good
understanding
*NL*
to
the
efforts
of
his
aunt
,
who
did
call
on
him
in
her
return
through
*NL*
London
,
and
there
relate
her
journey
to
Longbourn
,
its
motive
,
and
the
*NL*
substance
of
her
conversation
with
Elizabeth
;
dwelling
emphatically
on
*NL*
every
expression
of
the
latter
which
,
in
her
ladyship
's
apprehension
,
*NL*
peculiarly
denoted
her
perverseness
and
assurance
;
in
the
belief
that
*NL*
such
a
relation
must
assist
her
endeavours
to
obtain
that
promise
*NL*
from
her
nephew
which
she
had
refused
to
give
.
But
,
unluckily
for
her
*NL*
ladyship
,
its
effect
had
been
exactly
contrariwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

he
,

*NL*
Elizabeth
coloured

laughed

abominably

have
no

in
abusing
you

all

your

were
ill-founded
,
formed
on
mistaken
premises
,
my
*NL*
behaviour
to
you
at
the
time
had
merited
the
severest
reproof

It
was
*NL*
unpardonable

I
can
not
think
of
it

abhorrence

*NL*
``
We
will
not
quarrel
for
the
greater

annexed

said
Elizabeth
.
``
The
conduct

neither

irreproachable

both

*NL*

my

the
whole
of

*NL*

Darcy
mentioned
his

said
he

explained

was
one
part

the
opening

I
should
dread
your

the

remember
some

The

,
though
we
have
both

my

*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
wrote
that

''
replied
Darcy
,
``
I
believed
myself
perfectly
*NL*
calm

cool

I
am

convinced

dreadful

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

perhaps
,
began
in
bitterness

it

The

adieu

charity
itself

think
no

of
the
letter

The
feelings

of
the

the

are
now
*NL*
so
widely
different
from
what
they
were
then
,
that
every
unpleasant
*NL*
circumstance
attending
it
ought
to
be
forgotten
.
You
must
learn
some
*NL*
of
my
philosophy
.
Think
only
of
the
past
as
its
remembrance
gives
you
*NL*
pleasure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
give
you
credit
for
any
philosophy

Your

retrospections
must
be
so
totally
void
of
reproach
,
that
the
contentment
*NL*
arising
from
them
is
not
of
philosophy
,
but
,
what
is
much
better
,
of
*NL*
innocence
.
But
with
me
,
it
is
not
so
.
Painful
recollections
will
intrude
*NL*
which
can
not
,
which
ought
not

to
be
repelled

I
have
been
a
selfish
*NL*
being
all
my
life
,
in
practice
,
though
not
in
principle
.
As
a
child
I
*NL*
was
taught
what
was
right
,
but
I
was
not
taught
to
correct
my
temper
.
I
*NL*
was
given
good
principles
,
but
left
to
follow
them
in
pride
and
conceit
.
*NL*
Unfortunately
an
only
son
-LRB-
for
many
years
an
only
child
-RRB-
,
I
was
spoilt
*NL*
by
my
parents
,
who
,
though
good
themselves
-LRB-
my
father
,
particularly
,
all
*NL*
that
was
benevolent
and
amiable
-RRB-
,
allowed
,
encouraged
,
almost
taught
*NL*
me
to
be
selfish
and
overbearing
;
to
care
for
none
beyond
my
own
family
*NL*
circle
;
to
think
meanly
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
;
to
wish
at
least
*NL*
to
think
meanly
of
their
sense
and
worth
compared
with
my
own
.
Such
I
*NL*
was
,
from
eight
to
eight
and
twenty
;
and
such
I
might
still
have
been
*NL*
but
for
you
,
dearest
,
loveliest
Elizabeth

What
do
I
not
owe
you
!
You
*NL*
taught
me
a
lesson
,
hard
indeed
at
first
,
but
most
advantageous
.
By
you
,
*NL*
I
was
properly
humbled
.
I
came
to
you
without
a
doubt
of
my
reception
.
*NL*
You
showed
me
how
insufficient
were
all
my
pretensions
to
please
a
woman
*NL*
worthy
of
being
pleased

*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
you
then
persuaded
yourself

Indeed
I

*NL*
``
My

been

I
never

deceive
you

my
spirits
might
often
lead
me

wrong

How
you

have
hated
me
after

evening

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hate

I
was
angry
perhaps
at

my

soon
began

take

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
almost
afraid

not

told

that
I
deserved
no
extraordinary

I
*NL*
confess
that
I
did
not

receive
_
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
object
then

replied
Darcy
,
``
was
to
show
you
,
by
every
civility

my
power

that
I
was
not
so
mean

resent
the

I
hoped

obtain
your
forgiveness

to
lessen
your
ill
opinion

by
letting
you

see
that
your
reproofs
had
been
attended
to
.
How
soon
any
other
wishes
*NL*
introduced
themselves
I
can
hardly
tell
,

I
believe
in
about
half
an
*NL*
hour
after
I
had
seen
you

*NL*
He
then
told
her
of
Georgiana
's
delight
in
her
acquaintance
,
and
of
her
*NL*
disappointment
at
its
sudden
interruption
;
which
naturally
leading
to
*NL*
the
cause
of
that
interruption
,
she
soon
learnt
that
his
resolution
of
*NL*
following
her
from
Derbyshire
in
quest
of
her
sister
had
been
formed
*NL*
before
he
quitted
the
inn
,
and
that
his
gravity
and
thoughtfulness
*NL*
there
had
arisen
from
no
other
struggles
than
what
such
a
purpose
must
*NL*
comprehend
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
expressed
her
gratitude
again
,
but
it
was
too
painful
a
subject
to
*NL*
each
,
to
be
dwelt
on
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
walking
several
miles
in
a
leisurely
manner
,
and
too
busy
to
know
*NL*
anything
about
it
,
they
found
at
last
,
on
examining
their
watches
,
that
*NL*
it
was
time
to
be
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
could
become
of
Mr.
Bingley
and
Jane

''
was
a
wonder
which
*NL*
introduced
the
discussion
of
their
affairs
.
Darcy
was
delighted
with
*NL*
their
engagement

his
friend
had
given
him
the
earliest
information
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
ask
whether
you
were
surprised

said
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all

When
I
went
away

I
felt
that
it

soon
happen

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
you
had
given

I
guessed
as
much

And
*NL*
though
he
exclaimed
at
the
term
,
she
found
that
it
had
been
pretty
much
*NL*
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
evening
before
my
going
to
London
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
made
a
*NL*
confession
to
him

which
I
believe
I
ought
to
have
made
long

I
*NL*
told
him
of
all
that
had
occurred
to
make
my
former
interference
in
his
*NL*
affairs
absurd
and
impertinent
.
His
surprise
was
great
.
He
had
never
had
*NL*
the
slightest
suspicion

I
told
him
,
moreover
,
that
I
believed
myself
*NL*
mistaken
in
supposing
,
as
I
had
done
,
that
your
sister
was
indifferent
*NL*
to
him
;
and
as
I
could
easily
perceive
that
his
attachment
to
her
was
*NL*
unabated
,
I
felt
no
doubt
of
their
happiness
together

*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
easy
manner
of
directing
his
*NL*
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
speak
from
your
own
observation

said
she
,
``

you
told
him

that
my
sister
loved
him
,
or
merely
from
my
information
last
spring
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
former
.
I
had
narrowly
observed
her
during
the
two
visits
*NL*
which
I
had
lately
made
here
;
and
I
was
convinced
of
her
affection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
assurance
of
it

I
suppose

immediate
conviction

him

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
did

Bingley
is
most
unaffectedly
modest

His
diffidence
had
*NL*
prevented
his
depending
on
his
own
judgment
in
so
anxious
a
case
,
but
*NL*
his
reliance
on
mine
made
every
thing
easy

I
was
obliged
to
confess
*NL*
one
thing
,
which
for
a
time
,
and
not
unjustly
,
offended
him

I
could
not
*NL*
allow
myself
to
conceal
that
your
sister
had
been
in
town
three
months
*NL*
last
winter
,
that
I
had
known
it

and
purposely
kept
it
from
him

He
was
*NL*
angry
.
But
his
anger
,
I
am
persuaded
,
lasted
no
longer
than
he
remained
*NL*
in
any
doubt
of
your
sister

sentiments

He
has
heartily
forgiven
me

now

*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
longed
to
observe
that
Mr.
Bingley
had
been
a
most
delightful
*NL*
friend
;
so
easily
guided
that
his
worth
was
invaluable
;
but
she
checked
*NL*
herself
.
She
remembered
that
he
had
yet
to
learn
to
be
laughed
at
,
*NL*
and
it
was
rather
too
early
to
begin
.
In
anticipating
the
happiness
*NL*
of
Bingley
,
which
of
course
was
to
be
inferior
only
to
his
own
,
he

continued
the
conversation

*NL*
``
My
dear
Lizzy

where
can
you

was
a
question
*NL*
which
Elizabeth
received
from
Jane
as
soon
as
she
entered
their
room
,
*NL*
and
from
all
the
others
when
they
sat
down
to
table
.
She
had
only
to
*NL*
say
in
reply
,
that
they
had
wandered
about
,
till
she
was
beyond
her
own
*NL*
knowledge
.
She
coloured
as
she
spoke
;
but
neither
that
,
nor
anything
*NL*
else
,
awakened
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
passed
quietly
,
unmarked
by
anything
extraordinary
.
The
*NL*
acknowledged
lovers
talked
and
laughed
,
the
unacknowledged
were
silent
.
*NL*
Darcy
was
not
of
a
disposition
in
which
happiness
overflows
in
mirth
;
*NL*
and
Elizabeth
,
agitated
and
confused
,
rather
_
knew
_
that
she
was
happy
*NL*
than
_
felt
_
herself
to
be
so
;
for
,
besides
the
immediate
embarrassment
,
*NL*
there
were
other
evils
before
her
.
She
anticipated
what
would
be
felt
*NL*
in
the
family
when
her
situation
became
known
;
she
was
aware
that
no
*NL*
one
liked
him
but
Jane
;
and
even
feared
that
with
the
others
it
was
a
*NL*
dislike
which
not
all
his
fortune
and
consequence
might
do
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
night
she
opened
her
heart
to
Jane
.
Though
suspicion
was
very
far
*NL*
from
Miss
Bennet

general
habits

she
was
absolutely
incredulous
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
nothing
of
the
matter

That

is
all
to
be
forgot

Perhaps
I
*NL*
did
not
always
love
him
so
well
as
I
do
now
.
But
in
such
cases
as
*NL*
these
,
a
good
memory
is
unpardonable
.
This
is
the
last
time
I
shall
ever
*NL*
remember
it
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bennet
still
looked
all
amazement
.
Elizabeth
again
,
and
more
*NL*
seriously
assured
her
of
its
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Heaven
!
can
it
be
really
so
!
Yet
now
I
must
believe
you

cried
*NL*
Jane
.
``
My
dear
,
dear
Lizzy
,
I
would
--
I
do
congratulate
you

but
are
you
*NL*
certain
?
forgive
the
question
--
are
you
quite
certain
that
you
can
be
*NL*
happy
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
.
It
is
settled
between
us
already
,
that
*NL*
we
are
to
be
the
happiest
couple
in
the
world
.
But
are
you
pleased
,
*NL*
Jane
?
Shall
you
like
to
have
such
a
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
,
very
much

Nothing
could
give
either
Bingley
or
myself
more
*NL*
delight
.
But
we
considered
it
,
we
talked
of
it
as
impossible
.
And
do
you
*NL*
really
love
him
quite
well
enough
?
Oh
,
Lizzy
!
do
anything
rather
than
*NL*
marry
without
affection

Are
you
quite
sure
that
you
feel
what
you

to
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

You
will
only
think
I
feel

more

than
I
ought
to
do
,
when
I
*NL*
tell
you
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
must
confess
that
I
love
him
better
than
I
do
Bingley

I
am
*NL*
afraid
you
will
be
angry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
sister

now
_
be
_
serious

I
want
to
talk
very
seriously

Let
*NL*
me
know
every
thing
that
I
am
to
know
,
without
delay
.
Will
you
tell
me
*NL*
how
long
you
have
loved
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
coming
on
so
gradually
,
that
I
hardly
know
when
it
began
.
*NL*
But
I
believe
I
must
date
it
from
my
first
seeing
his
beautiful
grounds
*NL*
at
Pemberley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
entreaty
that
she
would
be
serious
,
however
,
produced
the
*NL*
desired
effect
;
and
she
soon
satisfied
Jane
by
her
solemn
assurances
*NL*
of
attachment
.
When
convinced
on
that
article
,
Miss
Bennet
had
nothing
*NL*
further
to
wish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
am
quite
happy
,
''
said
she
,
``
for
you
will
be
as
happy
as
myself
.
*NL*
I
always
had
a
value
for
him
.
Were
it
for
nothing
but
his
love
of
you
,
*NL*
I
must
always
have
esteemed
him
;
but
now
,
as
Bingley
's
friend
and
your
*NL*
husband
,
there
can
be
only
Bingley
and
yourself
more
dear
to
me
.
But
*NL*
Lizzy
,
you
have
been
very
sly
,
very
reserved
with
me
.
How
little
did
you
*NL*
tell
me
of
what
passed
at
Pemberley
and
Lambton
!
I
owe
all
that
I
know
*NL*
of
it
to
another
,
not
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
told
her
the
motives
of
her
secrecy
.
She
had
been
unwilling
*NL*
to
mention
Bingley
;
and
the
unsettled
state
of
her
own
feelings
had
made
*NL*
her
equally
avoid
the
name
of
his
friend
.
But
now
she
would
no
longer
*NL*
conceal
from
her
his
share
in
Lydia
's
marriage
.
All
was
acknowledged
,
*NL*
and
half
the
night
spent
in
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Bennet
,
as
she
stood
at
a
window
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
``
if
that
disagreeable
Mr.
Darcy
is
not
coming
here
again
with
*NL*
our
dear
Bingley
!
What
can
he
mean
by
being
so
tiresome
as
to
be
always
*NL*
coming
here
?
I
had
no
notion
but
he
would
go
a-shooting
,
or
something
or
*NL*
other
,
and
not
disturb
us
with
his
company
.
What
shall
we
do
with
him
?
*NL*
Lizzy
,
you
must
walk
out
with
him
again
,
that
he
may
not
be
in
Bingley
's
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
could
hardly
help
laughing
at
so
convenient
a
proposal
;
yet
*NL*
was
really
vexed
that
her
mother
should
be
always
giving
him
such
an
*NL*
epithet
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
entered
,
Bingley
looked
at
her
so
expressively
,
and
*NL*
shook
hands
with
such
warmth
,
as
left
no
doubt
of
his
good
information
;
*NL*
and
he
soon
afterwards
said
aloud
,
``
Mrs.
Bennet
,
have
you
no
more
lanes
*NL*
hereabouts
in
which
Lizzy
may
lose
her
way
again
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
advise
Mr.
Darcy
,
and
Lizzy
,
and
Kitty
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bennet
,
``
to
walk
*NL*
to
Oakham
Mount
this
morning
.
It
is
a
nice
long
walk
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
has
*NL*
never
seen
the
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
do
very
well
for
the
others
,
''
replied
Mr.
Bingley
;
``
but
I
am
*NL*
sure
it
will
be
too
much
for
Kitty
.
Wo
n't
it
,
Kitty
?
''
Kitty
owned
that
*NL*
she
had
rather
stay
at
home
.
Darcy
professed
a
great
curiosity
to
see
*NL*
the
view
from
the
Mount
,
and
Elizabeth
silently
consented
.
As
she
went
*NL*
up
stairs
to
get
ready
,
Mrs.
Bennet
followed
her
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
sorry
,
Lizzy
,
that
you
should
be
forced
to
have
that
*NL*
disagreeable
man
all
to
yourself
.
But
I
hope
you
will
not
mind
it
:
it
is
*NL*
all
for
Jane
's
sake
,
you
know
;
and
there
is
no
occasion
for
talking
*NL*
to
him
,
except
just
now
and
then
.
So
,
do
not
put
yourself
to
*NL*
inconvenience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
their
walk
,
it
was
resolved
that
Mr.
Bennet
's
consent
should
be
*NL*
asked
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
Elizabeth
reserved
to
herself
the
*NL*
application
for
her
mother
's
.
She
could
not
determine
how
her
mother
*NL*
would
take
it
;
sometimes
doubting
whether
all
his
wealth
and
grandeur
*NL*
would
be
enough
to
overcome
her
abhorrence
of
the
man
.
But
whether
she
*NL*
were
violently
set
against
the
match
,
or
violently
delighted
with
it
,
it
*NL*
was
certain
that
her
manner
would
be
equally
ill
adapted
to
do
credit
*NL*
to
her
sense
;
and
she
could
no
more
bear
that
Mr.
Darcy
should
hear
*NL*
the
first
raptures
of
her
joy
,
than
the
first
vehemence
of
her
*NL*
disapprobation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
soon
after
Mr.
Bennet
withdrew
to
the
library
,
she
saw
*NL*
Mr.
Darcy
rise
also
and
follow
him
,
and
her
agitation
on
seeing
it
was
*NL*
extreme
.
She
did
not
fear
her
father
's
opposition
,
but
he
was
going
to
*NL*
be
made
unhappy
;
and
that
it
should
be
through
her
means
--
that
_
she
_
,
*NL*
his
favourite
child
,
should
be
distressing
him
by
her
choice
,
should
be
*NL*
filling
him
with
fears
and
regrets
in
disposing
of
her
--
was
a
wretched
*NL*
reflection
,
and
she
sat
in
misery
till
Mr.
Darcy
appeared
again
,
when
,
*NL*
looking
at
him
,
she
was
a
little
relieved
by
his
smile
.
In
a
few
minutes
*NL*
he
approached
the
table
where
she
was
sitting
with
Kitty
;
and
,
while
*NL*
pretending
to
admire
her
work
said
in
a
whisper
,
``
Go
to
your
father
,
he
*NL*
wants
you
in
the
library
.
''
She
was
gone
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
was
walking
about
the
room
,
looking
grave
and
anxious
.
*NL*
``
Lizzy
,
''
said
he
,
``
what
are
you
doing
?
Are
you
out
of
your
senses
,
to
be
*NL*
accepting
this
man
?
Have
not
you
always
hated
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
earnestly
did
she
then
wish
that
her
former
opinions
had
been
more
*NL*
reasonable
,
her
expressions
more
moderate
!
It
would
have
spared
her
from
*NL*
explanations
and
professions
which
it
was
exceedingly
awkward
to
give
;
*NL*
but
they
were
now
necessary
,
and
she
assured
him
,
with
some
confusion
,
*NL*
of
her
attachment
to
Mr.
Darcy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
,
in
other
words
,
you
are
determined
to
have
him
.
He
is
rich
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
and
you
may
have
more
fine
clothes
and
fine
carriages
than
Jane
.
*NL*
But
will
they
make
you
happy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
other
objection
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
than
your
belief
of
my
*NL*
indifference
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
at
all
.
We
all
know
him
to
be
a
proud
,
unpleasant
sort
of
man
;
but
*NL*
this
would
be
nothing
if
you
really
liked
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
I
do
like
him
,
''
she
replied
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
``
I
love
him
.
*NL*
Indeed
he
has
no
improper
pride
.
He
is
perfectly
amiable
.
You
do
not
*NL*
know
what
he
really
is
;
then
pray
do
not
pain
me
by
speaking
of
him
in
*NL*
such
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lizzy
,
''
said
her
father
,
``
I
have
given
him
my
consent
.
He
is
the
kind
*NL*
of
man
,
indeed
,
to
whom
I
should
never
dare
refuse
anything
,
which
he
*NL*
condescended
to
ask
.
I
now
give
it
to
_
you
_
,
if
you
are
resolved
on
*NL*
having
him
.
But
let
me
advise
you
to
think
better
of
it
.
I
know
*NL*
your
disposition
,
Lizzy
.
I
know
that
you
could
be
neither
happy
nor
*NL*
respectable
,
unless
you
truly
esteemed
your
husband
;
unless
you
looked
*NL*
up
to
him
as
a
superior
.
Your
lively
talents
would
place
you
in
the
*NL*
greatest
danger
in
an
unequal
marriage
.
You
could
scarcely
escape
*NL*
discredit
and
misery
.
My
child
,
let
me
not
have
the
grief
of
seeing
*NL*
_
you
_
unable
to
respect
your
partner
in
life
.
You
know
not
what
you
are
*NL*
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
still
more
affected
,
was
earnest
and
solemn
in
her
reply
;
and
*NL*
at
length
,
by
repeated
assurances
that
Mr.
Darcy
was
really
the
object
*NL*
of
her
choice
,
by
explaining
the
gradual
change
which
her
estimation
of
*NL*
him
had
undergone
,
relating
her
absolute
certainty
that
his
affection
*NL*
was
not
the
work
of
a
day
,
but
had
stood
the
test
of
many
months
'
*NL*
suspense
,
and
enumerating
with
energy
all
his
good
qualities
,
she
did
*NL*
conquer
her
father
's
incredulity
,
and
reconcile
him
to
the
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
''
said
he
,
when
she
ceased
speaking
,
``
I
have
no
more
to
*NL*
say
.
If
this
be
the
case
,
he
deserves
you
.
I
could
not
have
parted
with
*NL*
you
,
my
Lizzy
,
to
anyone
less
worthy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
complete
the
favourable
impression
,
she
then
told
him
what
Mr.
Darcy
*NL*
had
voluntarily
done
for
Lydia
.
He
heard
her
with
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
an
evening
of
wonders
,
indeed
!
And
so
,
Darcy
did
every
thing
;
*NL*
made
up
the
match
,
gave
the
money
,
paid
the
fellow
's
debts
,
and
got
him
*NL*
his
commission
!
So
much
the
better
.
It
will
save
me
a
world
of
trouble
*NL*
and
economy
.
Had
it
been
your
uncle
's
doing
,
I
must
and
_
would
_
have
*NL*
paid
him
;
but
these
violent
young
lovers
carry
every
thing
their
own
*NL*
way
.
I
shall
offer
to
pay
him
to-morrow
;
he
will
rant
and
storm
about
*NL*
his
love
for
you
,
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
recollected
her
embarrassment
a
few
days
before
,
on
his
reading
*NL*
Mr.
Collins
's
letter
;
and
after
laughing
at
her
some
time
,
allowed
her
*NL*
at
last
to
go
--
saying
,
as
she
quitted
the
room
,
``
If
any
young
men
come
*NL*
for
Mary
or
Kitty
,
send
them
in
,
for
I
am
quite
at
leisure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
mind
was
now
relieved
from
a
very
heavy
weight
;
and
,
after
*NL*
half
an
hour
's
quiet
reflection
in
her
own
room
,
she
was
able
to
join
*NL*
the
others
with
tolerable
composure
.
Every
thing
was
too
recent
for
*NL*
gaiety
,
but
the
evening
passed
tranquilly
away
;
there
was
no
longer
*NL*
anything
material
to
be
dreaded
,
and
the
comfort
of
ease
and
familiarity
*NL*
would
come
in
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
mother
went
up
to
her
dressing-room
at
night
,
she
followed
her
,
*NL*
and
made
the
important
communication
.
Its
effect
was
most
extraordinary
;
*NL*
for
on
first
hearing
it
,
Mrs.
Bennet
sat
quite
still
,
and
unable
to
*NL*
utter
a
syllable
.
Nor
was
it
under
many
,
many
minutes
that
she
could
*NL*
comprehend
what
she
heard
;
though
not
in
general
backward
to
credit
*NL*
what
was
for
the
advantage
of
her
family
,
or
that
came
in
the
shape
of
a
*NL*
lover
to
any
of
them
.
She
began
at
length
to
recover
,
to
fidget
about
in
*NL*
her
chair
,
get
up
,
sit
down
again
,
wonder
,
and
bless
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
!
Lord
bless
me
!
only
think
!
dear
me
!
Mr.
Darcy
!
Who
would
*NL*
have
thought
it
!
And
is
it
really
true
?
Oh
!
my
sweetest
Lizzy
!
how
rich
*NL*
and
how
great
you
will
be

What
pin-money
,
what
jewels

what
carriages
*NL*
you
will
have

Jane

nothing

nothing

pleased

so
happy

so
handsome

so
tall

Oh

my
*NL*
dear
Lizzy

pray
apologise
for
my
having
disliked
him
so
much
before

I

hope

will
overlook
it

A

in
town

Every

*NL*
that
is
charming

Three
daughters
married
!
Ten
thousand
a
year
!
Oh
,
*NL*
Lord
!
What
will
become
of
me
.
I
shall
go
distracted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
enough
to
prove
that
her
approbation
need
not
be
doubted
:
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
rejoicing
that
such
an
effusion
was
heard
only
by
herself
,
*NL*
soon
went
away
.
But
before
she
had
been
three
minutes
in
her
own
room
,
*NL*
her
mother
followed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
child
,
''
she
cried
,
``
I
can
think
of
nothing
else
!
Ten
*NL*
thousand
a
year
,
and
very
likely
more
!
'T
is
as
good
as
a
Lord
!
And
a
*NL*
special
licence
.
You
must
and
shall
be
married
by
a
special
licence
.
But
*NL*
my
dearest
love
,
tell
me
what
dish
Mr.
Darcy
is
particularly
fond
of
,
*NL*
that
I
may
have
it
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
sad
omen
of
what
her
mother
's
behaviour
to
the
gentleman
*NL*
himself
might
be
;
and
Elizabeth
found
that
,
though
in
the
certain
*NL*
possession
of
his
warmest
affection
,
and
secure
of
her
relations
'
*NL*
consent
,
there
was
still
something
to
be
wished
for
.
But
the
morrow
*NL*
passed
off
much
better
than
she
expected
;
for
Mrs.
Bennet
luckily
stood
*NL*
in
such
awe
of
her
intended
son-in-law
that
she
ventured
not
to
speak
to
*NL*
him
,
unless
it
was
in
her
power
to
offer
him
any
attention
,
or
mark
her
*NL*
deference
for
his
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
father
taking
pains
to
get
*NL*
acquainted
with
him
;
and
Mr.
Bennet
soon
assured
her
that
he
was
rising
*NL*
every
hour
in
his
esteem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
admire
all
my
three
sons-in-law
highly
,
''
said
he
.
``
Wickham
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
is
my
favourite

I
think
I
shall
like

your

well

*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
spirits
soon
rising
to
playfulness
again
,
she
wanted
Mr.
*NL*
Darcy
to
account
for
his
having
ever
fallen
in
love
with
her
.
``
How
could
*NL*
you
begin
?

said
she
.
``
I
can
comprehend
your
going
on
charmingly
,
when
*NL*
you
had
once
made
a
beginning

what
could
set
you
off
in
the
first

place
?

*NL*
*NL*

I

not
fix
on
the
hour

*NL*
laid
the
foundation

It
is

early

for
my
manners

my
behaviour
*NL*
to
_
you
_
was
at
least
always
bordering
on
the
uncivil
,
and
I
never
spoke
*NL*
to
you
without
rather
wishing
to
give
you
pain
than
not
.
Now
be
sincere

you
admire
me
for
my
impertinence

For

I
did

*NL*
``
You
may
as
well
call
it
impertinence
at
once

It
was
very
little
less

*NL*
The
fact
is
,
that
you
were
sick
of
civility
,
of
deference
,
of
officious
*NL*
attention
.
You
were
disgusted
with
the
women
who
were
always
speaking
,
*NL*
and
looking
,
and
thinking
for
_
your
_
approbation
alone

I
roused
,

*NL*
interested
you

because
I
was
so
unlike

Had
you
not

you

have
hated
me

it

in

of
the
pains

took
to

yourself

your
feelings
were
always
noble

just
;
and
*NL*
in
your
heart

you
thoroughly
despised

so
assiduously

I
have
saved

trouble

accounting
for

it

really

all
things
considered
,
I
begin
to
think
it
perfectly
*NL*
reasonable

To
be
sure
,
you
knew
no
actual
good
of
me

nobody
thinks
*NL*
of
_
that
_
when
they
fall
in

My

I
shall

From
an

answered

now

having
_

to
communicate
which
she

would

most
welcome

she
was
almost
ashamed
to
find
that
her
uncle

*NL*
aunt
had
already
lost
three
days
of
happiness
,
and
immediately
wrote
as

follows

I
would
have

kind

satisfactory

detail

particulars

to
say
the
*NL*
truth

I
was
too
cross
to
write

You
supposed
more
than
really
existed

*NL*
But
_
now
_
suppose
as
much
as
you
choose
;
give
a
loose
rein
to
your
*NL*
fancy
,
indulge
your
imagination
in
every
possible
flight
which
the
*NL*
subject
will
afford
,
and
unless
you
believe
me
actually
married
,
you
*NL*
can
not
greatly
err

You
must
write
again
very
soon

and
praise
him
a
*NL*
great
deal
more
than
you
did
in
your
last

thank
you

again

again

*NL*
for
not
going

How
could
I
be
so
silly

wish
it

idea

delightful

We
will
go
round
the

every
day

am
the
happiest
creature

Perhaps
other
people
have
said
so

not
one
with
such
justice

am
happier

smiles

laugh

Mr.

letter

and
still
*NL*
different
from

was
what
Mr.

sent

reply

Console
Lady
Catherine
as
well
as
you
can

But
,
if
I
were

I
would
stand
by
the
nephew

has
more
to
give

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
's
congratulations
to
her
brother
,
on
his
approaching
*NL*
marriage
,
were
all
that
was
affectionate
and
insincere
.
She
wrote
even
*NL*
to
Jane
on
the
occasion
,
to
express
her
delight
,
and
repeat
all
her
*NL*
former
professions
of
regard
.
Jane
was
not
deceived
,
but
she
was
*NL*
affected
;
and
though
feeling
no
reliance
on
her
,
could
not
help
writing
*NL*
her
a
much
kinder
answer
than
she
knew
was
deserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
joy
which
Miss
Darcy
expressed
on
receiving
similar
information
,
*NL*
was
as
sincere
as
her
brother
's
in
sending
it
.
Four
sides
of
paper
were
*NL*
insufficient
to
contain
all
her
delight
,
and
all
her
earnest
desire
of
*NL*
being
loved
by
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
any
answer
could
arrive
from
Mr.
Collins
,
or
any
congratulations
*NL*
to
Elizabeth
from
his
wife
,
the
Longbourn
family
heard
that
the
*NL*
Collinses
were
come
themselves
to
Lucas
Lodge
.
The
reason
of
this
*NL*
sudden
removal
was
soon
evident
.
Lady
Catherine
had
been
rendered
*NL*
so
exceedingly
angry
by
the
contents
of
her
nephew
's
letter
,
that
*NL*
Charlotte
,
really
rejoicing
in
the
match
,
was
anxious
to
get
away
till
*NL*
the
storm
was
blown
over
.
At
such
a
moment
,
the
arrival
of
her
friend
*NL*
was
a
sincere
pleasure
to
Elizabeth
,
though
in
the
course
of
their
*NL*
meetings
she
must
sometimes
think
the
pleasure
dearly
bought
,
when
she
*NL*
saw
Mr.
Darcy
exposed
to
all
the
parading
and
obsequious
civility
of
*NL*
her
husband
.
He
bore
it
,
however
,
with
admirable
calmness
.
He
could
even
*NL*
listen
to
Sir
William
Lucas
,
when
he
complimented
him
on
carrying
away
*NL*
the
brightest
jewel
of
the
country
,
and
expressed
his
hopes
of
their
all
*NL*
meeting
frequently
at
St.
James
's
,
with
very
decent
composure
.
If
he
did
*NL*
shrug
his
shoulders
,
it
was
not
till
Sir
William
was
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Phillips
's
vulgarity
was
another
,
and
perhaps
a
greater
,
tax
on
his
*NL*
forbearance
;
and
though
Mrs.
Phillips
,
as
well
as
her
sister
,
stood
in
*NL*
too
much
awe
of
him
to
speak
with
the
familiarity
which
Bingley
's
good
*NL*
humour
encouraged
,
yet
,
whenever
she
_
did
_
speak
,
she
must
be
vulgar
.
*NL*
Nor
was
her
respect
for
him
,
though
it
made
her
more
quiet
,
at
all
*NL*
likely
to
make
her
more
elegant
.
Elizabeth
did
all
she
could
to
shield
*NL*
him
from
the
frequent
notice
of
either
,
and
was
ever
anxious
to
keep
*NL*
him
to
herself
,
and
to
those
of
her
family
with
whom
he
might
converse
*NL*
without
mortification
;
and
though
the
uncomfortable
feelings
arising
*NL*
from
all
this
took
from
the
season
of
courtship
much
of
its
pleasure
,
it
*NL*
added
to
the
hope
of
the
future
;
and
she
looked
forward
with
delight
to
*NL*
the
time
when
they
should
be
removed
from
society
so
little
pleasing
*NL*
to
either
,
to
all
the
comfort
and
elegance
of
their
family
party
at
*NL*
Pemberley
.

Chapter
61
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Happy
for
all
her
maternal
feelings
was
the
day
on
which
Mrs.
Bennet
got
*NL*
rid
of
her
two
most
deserving
daughters
.
With
what
delighted
pride
*NL*
she
afterwards
visited
Mrs.
Bingley
,
and
talked
of
Mrs.
Darcy
,
may
*NL*
be
guessed
.
I
wish
I
could
say
,
for
the
sake
of
her
family
,
that
the
*NL*
accomplishment
of
her
earnest
desire
in
the
establishment
of
so
many
*NL*
of
her
children
produced
so
happy
an
effect
as
to
make
her
a
sensible
,
*NL*
amiable
,
well-informed
woman
for
the
rest
of
her
life
;
though
perhaps
it
*NL*
was
lucky
for
her
husband
,
who
might
not
have
relished
domestic
felicity
*NL*
in
so
unusual
a
form
,
that
she
still
was
occasionally
nervous
and
*NL*
invariably
silly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bennet
missed
his
second
daughter
exceedingly
;
his
affection
for
her
*NL*
drew
him
oftener
from
home
than
anything
else
could
do
.
He
delighted
in
*NL*
going
to
Pemberley
,
especially
when
he
was
least
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bingley
and
Jane
remained
at
Netherfield
only
a
twelvemonth
.
So
near
*NL*
a
vicinity
to
her
mother
and
Meryton
relations
was
not
desirable
even
to
*NL*
_
his
_
easy
temper
,
or
_
her
_
affectionate
heart
.
The
darling
wish
of
his
*NL*
sisters
was
then
gratified
;
he
bought
an
estate
in
a
neighbouring
county
*NL*
to
Derbyshire
,
and
Jane
and
Elizabeth
,
in
addition
to
every
other
source
*NL*
of
happiness
,
were
within
thirty
miles
of
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
,
to
her
very
material
advantage
,
spent
the
chief
of
her
time
with
*NL*
her
two
elder
sisters
.
In
society
so
superior
to
what
she
had
generally
*NL*
known
,
her
improvement
was
great
.
She
was
not
of
so
ungovernable
a
*NL*
temper
as
Lydia
;
and
,
removed
from
the
influence
of
Lydia
's
example
,
*NL*
she
became
,
by
proper
attention
and
management
,
less
irritable
,
less
*NL*
ignorant
,
and
less
insipid
.
From
the
further
disadvantage
of
Lydia
's
*NL*
society
she
was
of
course
carefully
kept
,
and
though
Mrs.
Wickham
*NL*
frequently
invited
her
to
come
and
stay
with
her
,
with
the
promise
of
*NL*
balls
and
young
men
,
her
father
would
never
consent
to
her
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
the
only
daughter
who
remained
at
home
;
and
she
was
necessarily
*NL*
drawn
from
the
pursuit
of
accomplishments
by
Mrs.
Bennet
's
being
quite
*NL*
unable
to
sit
alone
.
Mary
was
obliged
to
mix
more
with
the
world
,
but
*NL*
she
could
still
moralize
over
every
morning
visit
;
and
as
she
was
no
*NL*
longer
mortified
by
comparisons
between
her
sisters
'
beauty
and
her
own
,
*NL*
it
was
suspected
by
her
father
that
she
submitted
to
the
change
without
*NL*
much
reluctance
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Wickham
and
Lydia
,
their
characters
suffered
no
revolution
from
*NL*
the
marriage
of
her
sisters
.
He
bore
with
philosophy
the
conviction
that
*NL*
Elizabeth
must
now
become
acquainted
with
whatever
of
his
ingratitude
*NL*
and
falsehood
had
before
been
unknown
to
her
;
and
in
spite
of
every
*NL*
thing
,
was
not
wholly
without
hope
that
Darcy
might
yet
be
prevailed
on
*NL*
to
make
his
fortune
.
The
congratulatory
letter
which
Elizabeth
received
*NL*
from
Lydia
on
her
marriage
,
explained
to
her
that
,
by
his
wife
at
least
,
*NL*
if
not
by
himself
,
such
a
hope
was
cherished
.
The
letter
was
to
this
*NL*
effect
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
MY
DEAR
LIZZY
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
joy
.
If
you
love
Mr.
Darcy
half
as
well
as
I
do
my
dear
*NL*
Wickham
,
you
must
be
very
happy
.
It
is
a
great
comfort
to
have
you
so
*NL*
rich
,
and
when
you
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
I
hope
you
will
think
of
us
.
*NL*
I
am
sure
Wickham
would
like
a
place
at
court
very
much
,
and
I
do
not
*NL*
think
we
shall
have
quite
money
enough
to
live
upon
without
some
help
.
*NL*
Any
place
would
do
,
of
about
three
or
four
hundred
a
year
;
but
however
,
*NL*
do
not
speak
to
Mr.
Darcy
about
it
,
if
you
had
rather
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yours
,
etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
happened
that
Elizabeth
had
_
much
_
rather
not
,
she
endeavoured
in
*NL*
her
answer
to
put
an
end
to
every
entreaty
and
expectation
of
the
kind
.
*NL*
Such
relief
,
however
,
as
it
was
in
her
power
to
afford
,
by
the
practice
*NL*
of
what
might
be
called
economy
in
her
own
private
expences
,
she
*NL*
frequently
sent
them
.
It
had
always
been
evident
to
her
that
such
an
*NL*
income
as
theirs
,
under
the
direction
of
two
persons
so
extravagant
in
*NL*
their
wants
,
and
heedless
of
the
future
,
must
be
very
insufficient
to
*NL*
their
support
;
and
whenever
they
changed
their
quarters
,
either
Jane
or
*NL*
herself
were
sure
of
being
applied
to
for
some
little
assistance
*NL*
towards
discharging
their
bills
.
Their
manner
of
living
,
even
when
the
*NL*
restoration
of
peace
dismissed
them
to
a
home
,
was
unsettled
in
the
*NL*
extreme
.
They
were
always
moving
from
place
to
place
in
quest
of
a
cheap
*NL*
situation
,
and
always
spending
more
than
they
ought
.
His
affection
for
*NL*
her
soon
sunk
into
indifference
;
hers
lasted
a
little
longer
;
and
*NL*
in
spite
of
her
youth
and
her
manners
,
she
retained
all
the
claims
to
*NL*
reputation
which
her
marriage
had
given
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Darcy
could
never
receive
_
him
_
at
Pemberley
,
yet
,
for
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
sake
,
he
assisted
him
further
in
his
profession
.
Lydia
was
*NL*
occasionally
a
visitor
there
,
when
her
husband
was
gone
to
enjoy
himself
*NL*
in
London
or
Bath
;
and
with
the
Bingleys
they
both
of
them
frequently
*NL*
staid
so
long
,
that
even
Bingley
's
good
humour
was
overcome
,
and
he
*NL*
proceeded
so
far
as
to
talk
of
giving
them
a
hint
to
be
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bingley
was
very
deeply
mortified
by
Darcy
's
marriage
;
but
as
she
*NL*
thought
it
advisable
to
retain
the
right
of
visiting
at
Pemberley
,
she
*NL*
dropt
all
her
resentment
;
was
fonder
than
ever
of
Georgiana
,
almost
as
*NL*
attentive
to
Darcy
as
heretofore
,
and
paid
off
every
arrear
of
civility
*NL*
to
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pemberley
was
now
Georgiana
's
home
;
and
the
attachment
of
the
sisters
*NL*
was
exactly
what
Darcy
had
hoped
to
see
.
They
were
able
to
love
each
*NL*
other
even
as
well
as
they
intended
.
Georgiana
had
the
highest
opinion
*NL*
in
the
world
of
Elizabeth
;
though
at
first
she
often
listened
with
*NL*
an
astonishment
bordering
on
alarm
at
her
lively
,
sportive
,
manner
of
*NL*
talking
to
her
brother
.
He
,
who
had
always
inspired
in
herself
a
respect
*NL*
which
almost
overcame
her
affection
,
she
now
saw
the
object
of
open
*NL*
pleasantry
.
Her
mind
received
knowledge
which
had
never
before
fallen
*NL*
in
her
way
.
By
Elizabeth
's
instructions
,
she
began
to
comprehend
that
*NL*
a
woman
may
take
liberties
with
her
husband
which
a
brother
will
not
*NL*
always
allow
in
a
sister
more
than
ten
years
younger
than
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Catherine
was
extremely
indignant
on
the
marriage
of
her
nephew
;
*NL*
and
as
she
gave
way
to
all
the
genuine
frankness
of
her
character
in
*NL*
her
reply
to
the
letter
which
announced
its
arrangement
,
she
sent
him
*NL*
language
so
very
abusive
,
especially
of
Elizabeth
,
that
for
some
time
*NL*
all
intercourse
was
at
an
end
.
But
at
length
,
by
Elizabeth
's
persuasion
,
*NL*
he
was
prevailed
on
to
overlook
the
offence
,
and
seek
a
reconciliation
;
*NL*
and
,
after
a
little
further
resistance
on
the
part
of
his
aunt
,
her
*NL*
resentment
gave
way
,
either
to
her
affection
for
him
,
or
her
curiosity
*NL*
to
see
how
his
wife
conducted
herself
;
and
she
condescended
to
wait
*NL*
on
them
at
Pemberley
,
in
spite
of
that
pollution
which
its
woods
had
*NL*
received
,
not
merely
from
the
presence
of
such
a
mistress
,
but
the
*NL*
visits
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
from
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
Gardiners
,
they
were
always
on
the
most
intimate
terms
.
*NL*
Darcy
,
as
well
as
Elizabeth
,
really
loved
them
;
and
they
were
both
ever
*NL*
sensible
of
the
warmest
gratitude
towards
the
persons
who
,
by
bringing
*NL*
her
into
Derbyshire
,
had
been
the
means
of
uniting
them
.
