THE

A
WHISPER
TO
THE
READER
*NL*
*NL*
_
There
is
no
character
,
howsoever
good
and
fine
,
but
it
can
*NL*
be
destroyed
by
ridicule
,
howsoever
poor
and
witless
.
*NL*
Observe
the
ass
,
for
instance
:
his
character
is
about
*NL*
perfect
,
he
is
the
choicest
spirit
among
all
the
humbler
*NL*
animals
,
yet
see
what
ridicule
has
brought
him
to
.
Instead
*NL*
of
feeling
complimented
when
we
are
called
an
ass
,
we
are
*NL*
left
in
doubt
.

A
person
who
is
ignorant
of
legal
matters
is
always
liable
to
make
*NL*
mistakes
when
he
tries
to
photograph
a
court
scene
with
his
pen
;
and
so
I
*NL*
was
not
willing
to
let
the
law
chapters
in
this
book
go
to
press
without
*NL*
first
subjecting
them
to
rigid
and
exhausting
revision
and
correction
by
*NL*
a
trained
barrister
--
if
that
is
what
they
are
called
.
These
chapters
are
*NL*
right
,
now
,
in
every
detail
,
for
they
were
rewritten
under
the
immediate
*NL*
eye
of
William
Hicks
,
who
studied
law
part
of
a
while
in
southwest
*NL*
Missouri
thirty-five
years
ago
and
then
came
over
here
to
Florence
for
*NL*
his
health
and
is
still
helping
for
exercise
and
board
in
Macaroni
*NL*
Vermicelli
's
horse-feed
shed
,
which
is
up
the
back
alley
as
you
turn
*NL*
around
the
corner
out
of
the
Piazza
del
Duomo
just
beyond
the
house
where
*NL*
that
stone
that
Dante
used
to
sit
on
six
hundred
years
ago
is
let
into
*NL*
the
wall
when
he
let
on
to
be
watching
them
build
Giotto
's
campanile
and
*NL*
yet
always
got
tired
looking
as
Beatrice
passed
along
on
her
way
to
get
a
*NL*
chunk
of
chestnut
cake
to
defend
herself
with
in
case
of
a
Ghibelline
*NL*
outbreak
before
she
got
to
school
,
at
the
same
old
stand
where
they
sell
*NL*
the
same
old
cake
to
this
day
and
it
is
just
as
light
and
good
as
it
was
*NL*
then
,
too
,
and
this
is
not
flattery
,
far
from
it
.
He
was
a
little
rusty
*NL*
on
his
law
,
but
he
rubbed
up
for
this
book
,
and
those
two
or
three
legal
*NL*
chapters
are
right
and
straight
,
now
.
He
told
me
so
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Given
under
my
hand
this
second
day
of
January
,
1893
,
at
the
Villa
*NL*
Viviani
,
village
of
Settignano
,
three
miles
back
of
Florence
,
on
the
*NL*
hills
--
the
same
certainly
affording
the
most
charming
view
to
be
found
*NL*
on
this
planet
,
and
with
it
the
most
dreamlike
and
enchanting
sunsets
to
*NL*
be
found
in
any
planet
or
even
in
any
solar
system
--
and
given
,
too
,
in
*NL*
the
swell
room
of
the
house
,
with
the
busts
of
Cerretani
senators
and
*NL*
other
grandees
of
this
line
looking
approvingly
down
upon
me
,
as
they
*NL*
used
to
look
down
upon
Dante
,
and
mutely
asking
me
to
adopt
them
into
my
*NL*
family
,
which
I
do
with
pleasure
,
for
my
remotest
ancestors
are
but
*NL*
spring
chickens
compared
with
these
robed
and
stately
antiques
,
and
it
*NL*
will
be
a
great
and
satisfying
lift
for
me
,
that
six
hundred
years
will

The
scene
of
this
chronicle
is
the
town
of
Dawson
's
Landing
,
on
the
*NL*
Missouri
side
of
the
Mississippi
,
half
a
day
's
journey
,
per
steamboat
,
*NL*
below
St.
Louis
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1830
it
was
a
snug
collection
of
modest
one
-
and
two-story
frame
*NL*
dwellings
,
whose
whitewashed
exteriors
were
almost
concealed
from
sight
*NL*
by
climbing
tangles
of
rose
vines
,
honeysuckles
,
and
morning
glories
.
*NL*
Each
of
these
pretty
homes
had
a
garden
in
front
fenced
with
white
*NL*
palings
and
opulently
stocked
with
hollyhocks
,
marigolds
,
touch-me-nots
,
*NL*
prince
's
-
feathers
,
and
other
old-fashioned
flowers
;
while
on
the
*NL*
windowsills
of
the
houses
stood
wooden
boxes
containing
moss
rose
plants
*NL*
and
terra-cotta
pots
in
which
grew
a
breed
of
geranium
whose
spread
of
*NL*
intensely
red
blossoms
accented
the
prevailing
pink
tint
of
the
rose-clad
*NL*
house-front
like
an
explosion
of
flame
.
When
there
was
room
on
the
ledge
*NL*
outside
of
the
pots
and
boxes
for
a
cat
,
the
cat
was
there
--
in
sunny
*NL*
weather
--
stretched
at
full
length
,
asleep
and
blissful
,
with
her
furry
*NL*
belly
to
the
sun
and
a
paw
curved
over
her
nose
.
Then
that
house
was
*NL*
complete
,
and
its
contentment
and
peace
were
made
manifest
to
the
world
*NL*
by
this
symbol
,
whose
testimony
is
infallible
.
A
home
without
a
cat
--
and
*NL*
a
well-fed
,
well-petted
,
and
properly
revered
cat
--
may
be
a
perfect
*NL*
home
,
perhaps
,
but
how
can
it
prove
title
?
*NL*
*NL*
All
along
the
streets
,
on
both
sides
,
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
brick
*NL*
sidewalks
,
stood
locust
trees
with
trunks
protected
by
wooden
boxing
,
and
*NL*
these
furnished
shade
for
summer
and
a
sweet
fragrancer
in
spring
,
when
*NL*
the
clusters
of
buds
came
forth
.
The
main
street
,
one
block
back
from
*NL*
the
river
,
and
running
parallel
with
it
,
was
the
sole
business
street
.
*NL*
It
was
six
blocks
long
,
and
in
each
block
two
or
three
brick
stores
,
*NL*
three
stories
high
,
towered
above
interjected
bunches
of
little
frame
*NL*
shops
.
Swinging
signs
creaked
in
the
wind
the
street
's
whole
length
.
*NL*
The
candy-striped
pole
,
which
indicates
nobility
proud
and
ancient
along
*NL*
the
palace-bordered
canals
of
Venice
,
indicated
merely
the
humble
*NL*
barbershop
along
the
main
street
of
Dawson
's
Landing
.
On
a
chief
corner
*NL*
stood
a
lofty
unpainted
pole
wreathed
from
top
to
bottom
with
tin
pots
*NL*
and
pans
and
cups
,
the
chief
tinmonger
's
noisy
notice
to
the
world
-LRB-
when
*NL*
the
wind
blew
-RRB-
that
his
shop
was
on
hand
for
business
at
that
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hamlet
's
front
was
washed
by
the
clear
waters
of
the
great
river
;
its
*NL*
body
stretched
itself
rearward
up
a
gentle
incline
;
its
most
rearward
*NL*
border
fringed
itself
out
and
scattered
its
houses
about
its
base
line
of
*NL*
the
hills
;
the
hills
rose
high
,
enclosing
the
town
in
a
half-moon
curve
,
*NL*
clothed
with
forests
from
foot
to
summit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Steamboats
passed
up
and
down
every
hour
or
so
.
Those
belonging
to
the
*NL*
little
Cairo
line
and
the
little
Memphis
line
always
stopped
;
the
big
*NL*
Orleans
liners
stopped
for
hails
only
,
or
to
land
passengers
or
freight
;
*NL*
and
this
was
the
case
also
with
the
great
flotilla
of
``
transients
.
''
*NL*
These
latter
came
out
of
a
dozen
rivers
--
the
Illinois
,
the
Missouri
,
the
*NL*
Upper
Mississippi
,
the
Ohio
,
the
Monongahela
,
the
Tennessee
,
the
Red
*NL*
River
,
the
White
River
,
and
so
on
--
and
were
bound
every
whither
and
*NL*
stocked
with
every
imaginable
comfort
or
necessity
,
which
the
*NL*
Mississippi
's
communities
could
want
,
from
the
frosty
Falls
of
St.
*NL*
Anthony
down
through
nine
climates
to
torrid
New
Orleans
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawson
's
Landing
was
a
slaveholding
town
,
with
a
rich
,
slave-worked
grain
*NL*
and
pork
country
back
of
it
.
The
town
was
sleepy
and
comfortable
and
*NL*
contented
.
It
was
fifty
years
old
,
and
was
growing
slowly
--
very
slowly
,
*NL*
in
fact
,
but
still
it
was
growing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
citizen
was
York
Leicester
Driscoll
,
about
forty
years
old
,
*NL*
judge
of
the
county
court
.
He
was
very
proud
of
his
old
Virginian
*NL*
ancestry
,
and
in
his
hospitalities
and
his
rather
formal
and
stately
*NL*
manners
,
he
kept
up
its
traditions
.
He
was
fine
and
just
and
generous
.
*NL*
To
be
a
gentleman
--
a
gentleman
without
stain
or
blemish
--
was
his
only
*NL*
religion
,
and
to
it
he
was
always
faithful
.
He
was
respected
,
esteemed
,
*NL*
and
beloved
by
all
of
the
community
.
He
was
well
off
,
and
was
gradually
*NL*
adding
to
his
store
.
He
and
his
wife
were
very
nearly
happy
,
but
not
*NL*
quite
,
for
they
had
no
children
.
The
longing
for
the
treasure
of
a
child
*NL*
had
grown
stronger
and
stronger
as
the
years
slipped
away
,
but
the
*NL*
blessing
never
came
--
and
was
never
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
pair
lived
the
judge
's
widowed
sister
,
Mrs.
Rachel
Pratt
,
and
*NL*
she
also
was
childless
--
childless
,
and
sorrowful
for
that
reason
,
and
not
*NL*
to
be
comforted
.
The
women
were
good
and
commonplace
people
,
and
did
*NL*
their
duty
,
and
had
their
reward
in
clear
consciences
and
the
community
's
*NL*
approbation
.
They
were
Presbyterians
,
the
judge
was
a
freethinker
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pembroke
Howard
,
lawyer
and
bachelor
,
aged
almost
forty
,
was
another
old
*NL*
Virginian
grandee
with
proved
descent
from
the
First
Families
.
He
was
a
*NL*
fine
,
majestic
creature
,
a
gentleman
according
to
the
nicest
requirements
*NL*
of
the
Virginia
rule
,
a
devoted
Presbyterian
,
an
authority
on
the
``
code
''
,
*NL*
and
a
man
always
courteously
ready
to
stand
up
before
you
in
the
field
if
*NL*
any
act
or
word
of
his
had
seemed
doubtful
or
suspicious
to
you
,
and
*NL*
explain
it
with
any
weapon
you
might
prefer
from
bradawls
to
artillery
.
*NL*
He
was
very
popular
with
the
people
,
and
was
the
judge
's
dearest
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
Colonel
Cecil
Burleigh
Essex
,
another
F.F.V.
of
formidable
*NL*
caliber
--
however
,
with
him
we
have
no
concern
.
*NL*
*NL*
Percy
Northumberland
Driscoll
,
brother
to
the
judge
,
and
younger
than
he
*NL*
by
five
years
,
was
a
married
man
,
and
had
had
children
around
his
*NL*
hearthstone
;
but
they
were
attacked
in
detail
by
measles
,
croup
,
and
*NL*
scarlet
fever
,
and
this
had
given
the
doctor
a
chance
with
his
effective
*NL*
antediluvian
methods
;
so
the
cradles
were
empty
.
He
was
a
prosperous
*NL*
man
,
with
a
good
head
for
speculations
,
and
his
fortune
was
growing
.
On
*NL*
the
first
of
February
,
1830
,
two
boy
babes
were
born
in
his
house
;
one
to
*NL*
him
,
one
to
one
of
his
slave
girls
,
Roxana
by
name
.
Roxana
was
twenty
*NL*
years
old
.
She
was
up
and
around
the
same
day
,
with
her
hands
full
,
for
*NL*
she
was
tending
both
babes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Percy
Driscoll
died
within
the
week
.
Roxy
remained
in
charge
of
the
*NL*
children
.
She
had
her
own
way
,
for
Mr.
Driscoll
soon
absorbed
himself
in
*NL*
his
speculations
and
left
her
to
her
own
devices
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
same
month
of
February
,
Dawson
's
Landing
gained
a
new
citizen
.
*NL*
This
was
Mr.
David
Wilson
,
a
young
fellow
of
Scotch
parentage
.
He
had
*NL*
wandered
to
this
remote
region
from
his
birthplace
in
the
interior
of
the
*NL*
State
of
New
York
,
to
seek
his
fortune
.
He
was
twenty-five
years
old
,
*NL*
college
bred
,
and
had
finished
a
post-college
course
in
an
Eastern
law
*NL*
school
a
couple
of
years
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
homely
,
freckled
,
sandy-haired
young
fellow
,
with
an
intelligent
*NL*
blue
eye
that
had
frankness
and
comradeship
in
it
and
a
covert
twinkle
of
*NL*
a
pleasant
sort
.
But
for
an
unfortunate
remark
of
his
,
he
would
no
doubt
*NL*
have
entered
at
once
upon
a
successful
career
at
Dawson
's
Landing
.
But
he
*NL*
made
his
fatal
remark
the
first
day
he
spent
in
the
village
,
and
it
*NL*
``
gaged
''
him
.
He
had
just
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
group
of
citizens
*NL*
when
an
invisible
dog
began
to
yelp
and
snarl
and
howl
and
make
himself
*NL*
very
comprehensively
disagreeable
,
whereupon
young
Wilson
said
,
much
as
*NL*
one
who
is
thinking
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
owned
half
of
that
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
somebody
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
would
kill
my
half
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
group
searched
his
face
with
curiosity
,
with
anxiety
even
,
but
found
*NL*
no
light
there
,
no
expression
that
they
could
read
.
They
fell
away
from
*NL*
him
as
from
something
uncanny
,
and
went
into
privacy
to
discuss
him
.
One
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Pears
to
be
a
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Pears
?
''
said
another
.
''
_
Is
,
_
I
reckon
you
better
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Said
he
wished
he
owned
_
half
_
of
the
dog
,
the
idiot
,
''
said
a
third
.
*NL*
``
What
did
he
reckon
would
become
of
the
other
half
if
he
killed
his
half
?
*NL*
Do
you
reckon
he
thought
it
would
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
must
have
thought
it
,
unless
he
IS
the
downrightest
fool
in
the
*NL*
world
;
because
if
he
had
n't
thought
it
,
he
would
have
wanted
to
own
the
*NL*
whole
dog
,
knowing
that
if
he
killed
his
half
and
the
other
half
died
,
he
*NL*
would
be
responsible
for
that
half
just
the
same
as
if
he
had
killed
that
*NL*
half
instead
of
his
own
.
Do
n't
it
look
that
way
to
you
,
gents
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
does
.
If
he
owned
one
half
of
the
general
dog
,
it
would
be
so
;
*NL*
if
he
owned

would

Mr.
Wilson
stood
elected
.
The
incident
was
told
all
over
the
town
,
and
*NL*
gravely
discussed
by
everybody
.
Within
a
week
he
had
lost
his
first
*NL*
name
;
Pudd
`
nhead
took
its
place
.
In
time
he
came
to
be
liked
,
and
well
*NL*
liked
too
;
but
by
that
time
the
nickname
had
got
well
stuck
on
,
and
it
*NL*
stayed
.
That
first
day
's
verdict
made
him
a
fool
,
and
he
was
not
able
to
*NL*
get
it
set
aside
,
or
even
modified
.
The
nickname
soon
ceased
to
carry
*NL*
any
harsh
or
unfriendly
feeling
with
it
,
but
it
held
its
place
,
and
was
*NL*
to
continue
to
hold
its
place
for
twenty
long
years

_
Adam
was

human

this
explains
it
all
.
He
did
not

the

for

,
he
wanted
it
only
because
it

The
mistake
was
in
not
forbidding

*NL*
*NL*
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
had
a
trifle
of
money
when
he
arrived
,
and
he
bought
a
*NL*
small
house
on
the
extreme
western
verge
of
the
town
.
Between
it
and
*NL*
Judge
Driscoll
's
house
there
was
only
a
grassy
yard
,
with
a
paling
fence
*NL*
dividing
the
properties
in
the
middle
.
He
hired
a
small
office
down
in
*NL*
the
town
and
hung
out
a
tin
sign
with
these
words
on
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
D
A
V
I
D
W
I
L
S
O
N
*NL*
*NL*
ATTORNEY
AND
COUNSELOR-AT-LAW
*NL*
*NL*
SURVEYING
,
CONVEYANCING
,
ETC.
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
deadly
remark
had
ruined
his
chance
--
at
least
in
the
law
.
No
*NL*
clients
came
.
He
took
down
his
sign
,
after
a
while
,
and
put
it
up
on
his
*NL*
own
house
with
the
law
features
knocked
out
of
it
.
It
offered
his
*NL*
services
now
in
the
humble
capacities
of
land
surveyor
and
expert
*NL*
accountant
.
Now
and
then
he
got
a
job
of
surveying
to
do
,
and
now
and
*NL*
then
a
merchant
got
him
to
straighten
out
his
books
.
With
Scotch
patience
*NL*
and
pluck
he
resolved
to
live
down
his
reputation
and
work
his
way
into
*NL*
the
legal
field
yet
.
Poor
fellow
,
he
could
foresee
that
it
was
going
to
*NL*
take
him
such
a
weary
long
time
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
rich
abundance
of
idle
time
,
but
it
never
hung
heavy
on
his
*NL*
hands
,
for
he
interested
himself
in
every
new
thing
that
was
born
into
*NL*
the
universe
of
ideas
,
and
studied
it
,
and
experimented
upon
it
at
his
*NL*
house
.
One
of
his
pet
fads
was
palmistry
.
To
another
one
he
gave
no
*NL*
name
,
neither
would
he
explain
to
anybody
what
its
purpose
was
,
but
*NL*
merely
said
it
was
an
amusement
.
In
fact
,
he
had
found
that
his
fads
*NL*
added
to
his
reputation
as
a
pudd
`
nhead
;
there
,
he
was
growing
chary
of
*NL*
being
too
communicative
about
them
.
The
fad
without
a
name
was
one
which
*NL*
dealt
with
people
's
finger
marks
.
He
carried
in
his
coat
pocket
a
*NL*
shallow
box
with
grooves
in
it
,
and
in
the
grooves
strips
of
glass
five
*NL*
inches
long
and
three
inches
wide
.
Along
the
lower
edge
of
each
strip
*NL*
was
pasted
a
slip
of
white
paper
.
He
asked
people
to
pass
their
hands
*NL*
through
their
hair
-LRB-
thus
collecting
upon
them
a
thin
coating
of
the
*NL*
natural
oil
-RRB-
and
then
making
a
thumb-mark
on
a
glass
strip
,
following
it
*NL*
with
the
mark
of
the
ball
of
each
finger
in
succession
.
Under
this
row
*NL*
of
faint
grease
prints
he
would
write
a
record
on
the
strip
of
white
*NL*
paper
--
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
JOHN
SMITH
,
right
hand
--
*NL*
*NL*
and
add
the
day
of
the
month
and
the
year
,
then
take
Smith
's
left
hand
on
*NL*
another
glass
strip
,
and
add
name
and
date
and
the
words
``
left
hand
.
''
The
*NL*
strips
were
now
returned
to
the
grooved
box
,
and
took
their
place
among
*NL*
what
Wilson
called
his
``
records
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
often
studied
his
records
,
examining
and
poring
over
them
with
*NL*
absorbing
interest
until
far
into
the
night
;
but
what
he
found
there
--
if
*NL*
he
found
anything
--
he
revealed
to
no
one
.
Sometimes
he
copied
on
paper
*NL*
the
involved
and
delicate
pattern
left
by
the
ball
of
the
finger
,
and
*NL*
then
vastly
enlarged
it
with
a
pantograph
so
that
he
could
examine
its
*NL*
web
of
curving
lines
with
ease
and
convenience
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
sweltering
afternoon
--
it
was
the
first
day
of
July
,
1830
--
he
was
at
*NL*
work
over
a
set
of
tangled
account
books
in
his
workroom
,
which
looked
*NL*
westward
over
a
stretch
of
vacant
lots
,
when
a
conversation
outside
*NL*
disturbed
him
.
It
was
carried
on
in
yells
,
which
showed
that
the
people
*NL*
engaged
in
it
were
not
close
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Roxy
,
how
does
yo
'
baby
come
on
?
''
This
from
the
distant
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fust-rate
.
How
does
_
you
_
come
on
,
Jasper
?
''
This
yell
was
from
close
*NL*
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

's

'
;

''
Roxy
followed
this
sally
with
another
*NL*
discharge
of
carefree
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
idle
and
aimless
jabber
went
on
and
on
,
both
parties
enjoying
the
*NL*
friendly
duel
and
each
well
satisfied
with
his
own
share
of
the
wit
*NL*
exchanged
--
for
wit
they
considered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
stepped
to
the
window
to
observe
the
combatants
;
he
could
not
work
*NL*
while
their
chatter
continued
.
Over
in
the
vacant
lots
was
Jasper
,
*NL*
young
,
coal
black
,
and
of
magnificent
build
,
sitting
on
a
wheelbarrow
in
*NL*
the
pelting
sun
--
at
work
,
supposably
,
whereas
he
was
in
fact
only
*NL*
preparing
for
it
by
taking
an
hour
's
rest
before
beginning
.
In
front
of
*NL*
Wilson
's
porch
stood
Roxy
,
with
a
local
handmade
baby
wagon
,
in
which
sat
*NL*
her
two
charges
--
one
at
each
end
and
facing
each
other
.
From
Roxy
's
*NL*
manner
of
speech
,
a
stranger
would
have
expected
her
to
be
black
,
but
she
*NL*
was
not
.
Only
one
sixteenth
of
her
was
black
,
and
that
sixteenth
did
not
*NL*
show
.
She
was
of
majestic
form
and
stature
,
her
attitudes
were
imposing
*NL*
and
statuesque
,
and
her
gestures
and
movements
distinguished
by
a
noble
*NL*
and
stately
grace
.
Her
complexion
was
very
fair
,
with
the
rosy
glow
of
*NL*
vigorous
health
in
her
cheeks
,
her
face
was
full
of
character
and
*NL*
expression
,
her
eyes
were
brown
and
liquid
,
and
she
had
a
heavy
suit
of
*NL*
fine
soft
hair
which
was
also
brown
,
but
the
fact
was
not
apparent
*NL*
because
her
head
was
bound
about
with
a
checkered
handkerchief
and
the
*NL*
hair
was
concealed
under
it
.
Her
face
was
shapely
,
intelligent
,
and
*NL*
comely
--
even
beautiful
.
She
had
an
easy
,
independent
carriage
--
when
she
*NL*
was
among
her
own
caste
--
and
a
high
and
``
sassy
''
way
,
withal
;
but
of
*NL*
course
she
was
meek
and
humble
enough
where
white
people
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
intents
and
purposes
Roxy
was
as
white
as
anybody
,
but
the
one
*NL*
sixteenth
of
her
which
was
black
outvoted
the
other
fifteen
parts
and
*NL*
made
her
a
Negro
.
She
was
a
slave
,
and
salable
as
such
.
Her
child
was
*NL*
thirty-one
parts
white
,
and
he
,
too
,
was
a
slave
,
and
by
a
fiction
of
law
*NL*
and
custom
a
Negro
.
He
had
blue
eyes
and
flaxen
curls
like
his
white
*NL*
comrade
,
but
even
the
father
of
the
white
child
was
able
to
tell
the
*NL*
children
apart
--
little
as
he
had
commerce
with
them
--
by
their
clothes
;
*NL*
for
the
white
babe
wore
ruffled
soft
muslin
and
a
coral
necklace
,
while
*NL*
the
other
wore
merely
a
coarse
tow-linen
shirt
which
barely
reached
to
*NL*
its
knees
,
and
no
jewelry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
white
child
's
name
was
Thomas
a
Becket
Driscoll
,
the
other
's
name
was
*NL*
Valet
de
Chambre
:
no
surname
--
slaves
had
n't
the
privilege
.
Roxana
had
*NL*
heard
that
phrase
somewhere
,
the
fine
sound
of
it
had
pleased
her
ear
,
*NL*
and
as
she
had
supposed
it
was
a
name
,
she
loaded
it
on
to
her
darling
.
*NL*
It
soon
got
shorted
to
``
Chambers
,
''
of
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
knew
Roxy
by
sight
,
and
when
the
duel
of
wits
begun
to
play
out
,
*NL*
he
stepped
outside
to
gather
in
a
record
or
two
.
Jasper
went
to
work
*NL*
energetically
,
at
once
,
perceiving
that
his
leisure
was
observed
.
Wilson
*NL*
inspected
the
children
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
are
they
,
Roxy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bofe

*NL*
*NL*
``

One
's

as
handsome
as
the
other
,
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
delighted
smile
exposed
the
girl
's
white
teeth
,
and
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless

*NL*
``
How
do

them
apart
,
Roxy
,
when
they
have
n't
any
clothes
on

''
*NL*
*NL*
Roxy
laughed
a
laugh
proportioned
to
her
size
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
I
_
kin
tell

,
but
I
bet

not

save
his
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
chatted
along
for
awhile
,
and
presently
got
Roxy
's
fingerprints
*NL*
for
his
collection
--
right
hand
and
left
--
on
a
couple
of
his
glass
strips
;
*NL*
then
labeled
and
dated
them
,
and
took
the
``
records
''
of
both
children
,
and
*NL*
labeled
and
dated
them
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
months
later
,
on
the
third
of
September
,
he
took
this
trio
of
finger
*NL*
marks
again
.
He
liked
to
have
a
``
series
,
''
two
or
three
``
takings
''
at
*NL*
intervals
during
the
period
of
childhood
,
these
to
be
followed
at
*NL*
intervals
of
several
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
--
that
is
to
say
,
on
the
fourth
of
September
--
something
*NL*
occurred
which
profoundly
impressed
Roxana
.
Mr.
Driscoll
missed
another
*NL*
small
sum
of
money
--
which
is
a
way
of
saying
that
this
was
not
a
new
*NL*
thing
,
but
had
happened
before
.
In
truth
,
it
had
happened
three
times
*NL*
before

's
patience
was
exhausted
.
He
was
a
fairly
humane
man
*NL*
toward
slaves
and
other
animals
;
he
was
an
exceedingly
humane
man
toward
*NL*
the
erring
of
his
own
race
.
Theft
he
could
not
abide
,
and
plainly
there
*NL*
was
a
thief
in
his
house
.
Necessarily
the
thief
must
be
one
of
his
*NL*
Negros
.
Sharp
measures
must
be
taken
.
He
called
his
servants
before
him
.
*NL*
There
were
three
of
these
,
besides
Roxy
:
a
man
,
a
woman
,
and
a
boy
*NL*
twelve
years
old
.
They
were
not
related
.
Mr.
Driscoll
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
all
been
warned
before
.
It
has
done
no
good
.
This
time
I
will
*NL*
teach
you
a
lesson
.
I
will
sell
the
thief
.
Which
of
you
is
the
guilty
*NL*
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
shuddered
at
the
threat
,
for
here
they
had
a
good
home
,
and
a
*NL*
new
one
was
likely
to
be
a
change
for
the
worse
.
The
denial
was
general
.
*NL*
None
had
stolen
anything
--
not
money
,
anyway
--
a
little
sugar
,
or
cake
,
or
*NL*
honey
,
or
something
like
that
,
that
``
Marse
Percy
would
n't
mind
or
miss
''
*NL*
but
not
money
--
never
a
cent
of
money
.
They
were
eloquent
in
their
*NL*
protestations
,
but
Mr.
Driscoll
was
not
moved
by
them
.
He
answered
each
*NL*
in
turn
with
a
stern
``
Name
the
thief
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
was
,
all
were
guilty
but
Roxana
;
she
suspected
that
the
others
*NL*
were
guilty
,
but
she
did
not
know
them
to
be
so
.
She
was
horrified
to
*NL*
think
how
near
she
had
come
to
being
guilty
herself
;
she
had
been
saved
*NL*
in
the
nick
of
time
by
a
revival
in
the
colored
Methodist
Church
,
a
*NL*
fortnight
before
,
at
which
time
and
place
she
``
got
religion
.
''
The
very
*NL*
next
day
after
that
gracious
experience
,
while
her
change
of
style
was
*NL*
fresh
upon
her
and
she
was
vain
of
her
purified
condition
,
her
master
*NL*
left
a
couple
dollars
unprotected
on
his
desk
,
and
she
happened
upon
that
*NL*
temptation
when
she
was
polishing
around
with
a
dustrag
.
She
looked
at
*NL*
the
money
awhile
with
a
steady
rising
resentment
,
then
she
burst
out
*NL*
with
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dad
blame
dat
revival
,
I
wisht
it
had
`
a
'
be
'n
put
off
till
tomorrow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
covered
the
tempter
with
a
book
,
and
another
member
of
the
*NL*
kitchen
cabinet
got
it
.
She
made
this
sacrifice
as
a
matter
of
religious
*NL*
etiquette
;
as
a
thing
necessary
just
now
,
but
by
no
means
to
be
wrested
*NL*
into
a
precedent
;
no
,
a
week
or
two
would
limber
up
her
piety
,
then
she
*NL*
would
be
rational
again
,
and
the
next
two
dollars
that
got
left
out
in
*NL*
the
cold
would
find
a
comforter
--
and
she
could
name
the
comforter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
she
bad
?
Was
she
worse
than
the
general
run
of
her
race
?
No
.
They
*NL*
had
an
unfair
show
in
the
battle
of
life
,
and
they
held
it
no
sin
to
take
*NL*
military
advantage
of
the
enemy
--
in
a
small
way
;
in
a
small
way
,
but
not
*NL*
in
a
large
one
.
They
would
smouch
provisions
from
the
pantry
whenever
*NL*
they
got
a
chance
;
or
a
brass
thimble
,
or
a
cake
of
wax
,
or
an
emery
bag
,
*NL*
or
a
paper
of
needles
,
or
a
silver
spoon
,
or
a
dollar
bill
,
or
small
*NL*
articles
of
clothing
,
or
any
other
property
of
light
value
;
and
so
far
*NL*
were
they
from
considering
such
reprisals
sinful
,
that
they
would
go
to
*NL*
church
and
shout
and
pray
the
loudest
and
sincerest
with
their
plunder
in
*NL*
their
pockets
.
A
farm
smokehouse
had
to
be
kept
heavily
padlocked
,
or
*NL*
even
the
colored
deacon
himself
could
not
resist
a
ham
when
Providence
*NL*
showed
him
in
a
dream
,
or
otherwise
,
where
such
a
thing
hung
lonesome
,
*NL*
and
longed
for
someone
to
love
.
But
with
a
hundred
hanging
before
him
,
*NL*
the
deacon
would
not
take
two
--
that
is
,
on
the
same
night
.
On
frosty
*NL*
nights
the
humane
Negro
prowler
would
warm
the
end
of
the
plank
and
put
*NL*
it
up
under
the
cold
claws
of
chickens
roosting
in
a
tree
;
a
drowsy
hen
*NL*
would
step
on
to
the
comfortable
board
,
softly
clucking
her
gratitude
,
*NL*
and
the
prowler
would
dump
her
into
his
bag
,
and
later
into
his
stomach
,
*NL*
perfectly
sure
that
in
taking
this
trifle
from
the
man
who
daily
robbed
*NL*
him
of
an
inestimable
treasure
--
his
liberty
--
he
was
not
committing
any
*NL*
sin
that
God
would
remember
against
him
in
the
Last
Great
Day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Name
the
thief
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
fourth
time
Mr.
Driscoll
had
said
it
,
and
always
in
the
same
hard
*NL*
tone
.
And
now
he
added
these
words
of
awful
import
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
one
minute
.
''
He
took
out
his
watch
.
``
If
at
the
end
of
that
*NL*
time
,
you
have
not
confessed
,
I
will
not
only
sell
all
four
of
you
,
*NL*
BUT
--
I
will
sell
you
DOWN
THE
RIVER
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
equivalent
to
condemning
them
to
hell
!
No
Missouri
Negro
doubted
*NL*
this
.
Roxy
reeled
in
her
tracks
,
and
the
color
vanished
out
of
her
face
;
*NL*
the
others
dropped
to
their
knees
as
if
they
had
been
shot
;
tears
gushed
*NL*
from
their
eyes
,
their
supplicating
hands
went
up
,
and
three
answers
came
*NL*
in
the
one
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
done
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
done
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
done
it
!
--
have
mercy
,
marster
--
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
po
'
niggers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
the
master
,
putting
up
his
watch
,
``
I
will
sell
you
*NL*
_
here
_
though
you
do
n't
deserve
it
.
You
ought
to
be
sold
down
the
*NL*
river
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
culprits
flung
themselves
prone
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
gratitude
,
and
*NL*
kissed
his
feet
,
declaring
that
they
would
never
forget
his
goodness
and
*NL*
never
cease
to
pray
for
him
as
long
as
they
lived
.
They
were
sincere
,
for
*NL*
like
a
god
he
had
stretched
forth
his
mighty
hand
and
closed
the
gates
of
*NL*
hell
against
them
.
He
knew
,
himself
,
that
he
had
done
a
noble
and
*NL*
gracious
thing
,
and
was
privately
well
pleased
with
his
magnanimity
;
and
*NL*
that
night
he
set
the
incident
down
in
his
diary
,
so
that
his
son
might
*NL*
read
it
in
after
years
,
and
be
thereby
moved
to
deeds
of
gentleness
and
*NL*
humanity
himself
.

*NL*
Percy
Driscoll
slept
well
the
night
he
saved
his
house
minions
from
*NL*
going
down
the
river
,
but
no
wink
of
sleep
visited
Roxy
's
eyes
.
A
*NL*
profound
terror
had
taken
possession
of
her
.
Her
child
could
grow
up
and
*NL*
be
sold
down
the
river
!
The
thought
crazed
her
with
horror
.
If
she
dozed
*NL*
and
lost
herself
for
a
moment
,
the
next
moment
she
was
on
her
feet
flying
*NL*
to
her
child
's
cradle
to
see
if
it
was
still
there
.
Then
she
would
gather
*NL*
it
to
her
heart
and
pour
out
her
love
upon
it
in
a
frenzy
of
kisses
,
*NL*
moaning
,
crying
,
and
saying
,
``
Dey

''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
,
when
she
was
tucking
him
back
in
its
cradle
again
,
the
other
child
*NL*
nestled
in
its
sleep
and
attracted
her
attention
.
She
went
and
stood
*NL*
over
it
a
long
time
communing
with
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
my
po
'
baby
done
,
dat

I
hates

,
en
I
could
kill

''
She
*NL*
paused
awhile
,
thinking
;
then
she
burst
into
wild
sobbings
again
,
and
*NL*
turned
away
,
saying
,
``
Oh
,
I
got
to
kill

''
She
*NL*
gathered
her
baby
to
her
bosom
now
,
and
began
to
smother
it
with
*NL*
caresses
.
``
Mammy

kin

river

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stared
toward
the
door
,
crooning
to
the
child
and
hushing
it
;
midway
*NL*
she
stopped
,
suddenly
.
She
had
caught
sight
of
her
new
Sunday
gown
--
a
*NL*
cheap
curtain-calico
thing
,
a
conflagration
of
gaudy
colors
and
fantastic
*NL*
figures
.
She
surveyed
it
wistfully
,
longingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hai
n't
ever
wore
it
yet
,
''
she
said
,
``
en
it
's
just
lovely
.
''
Then
she
*NL*
nodded
her
head
in
response
to
a
pleasant
idea
,
and
added
,
``
No
,
I
ai
n't
*NL*
gwine
to

at

able
ole
*NL*
linsey-woolsey

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
down
the
child
and
made
the
change
.
She
looked
in
the
glass
and
*NL*
was
astonished
at
her
beauty
.
She
resolved
to
make
her
death
toilet
*NL*
perfect
.
She
took
off
her
handkerchief
turban
and
dressed
her
glossy
*NL*
wealth
of
hair
``
like
white
folks
''
;
she
added
some
odds
and
ends
of
rather
*NL*
lurid
ribbon
and
a
spray
of
atrocious
artificial
flowers
;
finally
she
*NL*
threw
over
her
shoulders
a
fluffy
thing
called
a
``
cloud
''
in
that
day
,
*NL*
which
was
of
a
blazing
red
complexion
.
Then
she
was
ready
for
the
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gathered
up
her
baby
once
more
;
but
when
her
eye
fell
upon
its
*NL*
miserably
short
little
gray
tow-linen
shirt
and
noted
the
contrast
*NL*
between
its
pauper
shabbiness
and
her
own
volcanic
eruption
of
infernal
*NL*
splendors
,
her
mother-heart
was
touched
,
and
she
was
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
she
had
stripped
off
the
shirt
.
Now
she
clothed
the
naked
*NL*
little
creature
in
one
of
Thomas
`
a
Becket
's
snowy
,
long
baby
gowns
,
with
*NL*
its
bright
blue
bows
and
dainty
flummery
of
ruffles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dah
--
now
you
's
fixed

''
She
propped
the
child
in
a
chair
and
stood
off
*NL*
to
inspect
it
.
Straightway
her
eyes
begun
to
widen
with
astonishment
and
*NL*
admiration
,
and
she
clapped
her
hands
and
cried
out
,
``
Why

all

*NL*
*NL*
She
stepped
over
and
glanced
at
the
other
infant
;
she
flung
a
glance
*NL*
back
at
her
own
;
then
one
more
at
the
heir
of
the
house
.
Now
a
strange
*NL*
light
dawned
in
her
eyes
,
and
in
a
moment
she
was
lost
in
thought
.
She
*NL*
seemed
in
a
trance
;
when
she
came
out
of
it
,
she
muttered
,
``
When

*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
move
around
like
one
in
a
dream
.
She
undressed
Thomas
`
a
*NL*
Becket
,
stripping
him
of
everything
,
and
put
the
tow-linen
shirt
on
him
.
*NL*
She
put
his
coral
necklace
on
her
own
child
's
neck
.
Then
she
placed
the
*NL*
children
side
by
side
,
and
after
earnest
inspection
she
muttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

She
put

cub
in

elegant
cradle

said

She
put
the
heir
of
the
house
in
her
own
child
's
unpainted
pine
cradle
,
*NL*
and
said
,
contemplating
its

uneasily

flung
herself
on

began
to

toss

*NL*
By
and

she
sat
suddenly

for
a
comforting

flown

through

worried

She
began
to
muse
;
she
was
trying
to
gather
out
of
her
memory
the
dim
*NL*
particulars
of
some
tale
she
had
heard
some
time
or
other
.
At
last
she
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

*NL*
*NL*
She
got
lighthearted
and
happy
,
and
went
to
the
cradles
,
and
spent
what
*NL*
was
left
of
the
night
``
practicing
.
''
She
would
give
her
own
child
a
light
*NL*
pat
and
say
humbly
,
``
Lay
still

Marse

,
''
then
give
the

Tom
a
pat

and
say
with
severity
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
As
she
progressed
with
her
practice
,
she
was
surprised
to
see
how
*NL*
steadily
and
surely
the
awe
which
had
kept
her
tongue
reverent
and
her
*NL*
manner
humble
toward
her
young
master
was
transferring
itself
to
her
*NL*
speech
and
manner
toward
the
usurper
,
and
how
similarly
handy
she
was
*NL*
becoming
in
transferring
her
motherly
curtness
of
speech
and
*NL*
peremptoriness
of
manner
to
the
unlucky
heir
of
the
ancient
house
of
*NL*
Driscoll
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
occasional
rests
from
practicing
,
and
absorbed
herself
in

calculating
her
chances

The
new
Negros
gave
Roxy
no
trouble
,
of
course
.
The
master
gave
her
*NL*
none
,
for
one
of
his
speculations
was
in
jeopardy
,
and
his
mind
was
so
*NL*
occupied
that
he
hardly
saw
the
children
when
he
looked
at
them
,
and
all
*NL*
Roxy
had
to
do
was
to
get
them
both
into
a
gale
of
laughter
when
he
came
*NL*
about
;
then
their
faces
were
mainly
cavities
exposing
gums
,
and
he
was
*NL*
gone
again
before
the
spasm
passed
and
the
little
creatures
resumed
a
*NL*
human
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
a
few
days
the
fate
of
the
speculation
became
so
dubious
that
Mr.
*NL*
Percy
went
away
with
his
brother
,
the
judge
,
to
see
what
could
be
done
*NL*
with
it
.
It
was
a
land
speculation
as
usual
,
and
it
had
gotten
*NL*
complicated
with
a
lawsuit
.
The
men
were
gone
seven
weeks
.
Before
they
*NL*
got
back
,
Roxy
had
paid
her
visit
to
Wilson
,
and
was
satisfied
.
Wilson
*NL*
took
the
fingerprints
,
labeled
them
with
the
names
and
with
the
date
*NL*
--
October
the
first
--
put
them
carefully
away
,
and
continued
his
chat
with
*NL*
Roxy
,
who
seemed
very
anxious
that
he
should
admire
the
great
advance
in
*NL*
flesh
and
beauty
which
the
babes
had
made
since
he
took
their
*NL*
fingerprints
a
month
before
.
He
complimented
their
improvement
to
her
*NL*
contentment
;
and
as
they
were
without
any
disguise
of
jam
or
other
stain
,
*NL*
she
trembled
all
the
while
and
was
miserably
frightened
lest
at
any
*NL*
moment
he
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
n't
.
He
discovered
nothing
;
and
she
went
home
jubilant
,
and
*NL*
dropped
all
concern
about
the
matter
permanently
out
of
her
mind
.

The

Adam

had
many
advantages

the
principal

that

There
is
this
trouble
about
special
providences
--
namely
,
*NL*
there
is
so
often
a
doubt
as
to
which
party
was
intended
to
*NL*
be
the
beneficiary
.
In
the
case
of
the
children
,
the
bears
,
*NL*
and
the
prophet
,
the
bears
got
more
real
satisfaction
out
of
*NL*
the
episode
than
the
prophet
did
,
because
they
got
the

children

This
history
must
henceforth
accommodate
itself
to
the
change
which
*NL*
Roxana
has
consummated
,
and
call
the
real
heir
``
Chambers
''
and
the
*NL*
usurping
little
slave
,
``
Thomas
`
a
Becket
''
--
shortening
this
latter
name
to
*NL*
``
Tom
,
''
for
daily
use
,
as
the
people
about
him
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
''
was
a
bad
baby
,
from
the
very
beginning
of
his
usurpation
.
He
would
*NL*
cry
for
nothing
;
he
would
burst
into
storms
of
devilish
temper
without
*NL*
notice
,
and
let
go
scream
after
scream
and
squall
after
squall
,
then
*NL*
climax
the
thing
with
``
holding
his
breath
''
--
that
frightful
specialty
of
*NL*
the
teething
nursling
,
in
the
throes
of
which
the
creature
exhausts
its
*NL*
lungs
,
then
is
convulsed
with
noiseless
squirmings
and
twistings
and
*NL*
kickings
in
the
effort
to
get
its
breath
,
while
the
lips
turn
blue
and
*NL*
the
mouth
stands
wide
and
rigid
,
offering
for
inspection
one
wee
tooth
*NL*
set
in
the
lower
rim
of
a
hoop
of
red
gums
;
and
when
the
appalling
*NL*
stillness
has
endured
until
one
is
sure
the
lost
breath
will
never
*NL*
return
,
a
nurse
comes
flying
,
and
dashes
water
in
the
child
's
face
,
*NL*
and
--
presto
!
the
lungs
fill
,
and
instantly
discharge
a
shriek
,
or
a
yell
,
*NL*
or
a
howl
which
bursts
the
listening
ear
and
surprises
the
owner
of
it
*NL*
into
saying
words
which
would
not
go
well
with
a
halo
if
he
had
one
.
The
*NL*
baby
Tom
would
claw
anybody
who
came
within
reach
of
his
nails
,
and
pound
*NL*
anybody
he
could
reach
with
his
rattle
.
He
would
scream
for
water
until
*NL*
he
got
it
,
and
then
throw
cup
and
all
on
the
floor
and
scream
for
more
.
*NL*
He
was
indulged
in
all
his
caprices
,
howsoever
troublesome
and
*NL*
exasperating
they
might
be
;
he
was
allowed
to
eat
anything
he
wanted
,
*NL*
particularly
things
that
would
give
him
the
stomach-ache
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
got
to
be
old
enough
to
begin
to
toddle
about
and
say
broken
*NL*
words
and
get
an
idea
of
what
his
hands
were
for
,
he
was
a
more
*NL*
consummate
pest
than
ever
.
Roxy
got
no
rest
while
he
was
awake
.
He
would
*NL*
call
for
anything
and
everything
he
saw
,
simply
saying
,
``
Awnt
it
!
''
-LRB-
want
*NL*
it
-RRB-
,
which
was
a
command
.
When
it
was
brought
,
he
said
in
a
frenzy
,
and
*NL*
motioning
it
away
with
his
hands
,
``
Do
n't
awnt
it
!
do
n't
awnt
it
!
''
and
the
*NL*
moment
it
was
gone
he
set
up
frantic
yells
of
``
Awnt
it
!
awnt
it
!
''
and
*NL*
Roxy
had
to
give
wings
to
her
heels
to
get
that
thing
back
to
him
again
*NL*
before
he
could
get
time
to
carry
out
his
intention
of
going
into
*NL*
convulsions
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
preferred
above
all
other
things
was
the
tongs
.
This
was
because
*NL*
his
``
father
''
had
forbidden
him
to
have
them
lest
he
break
windows
and
*NL*
furniture
with
them
.
The
moment
Roxy
's
back
was
turned
he
would
toddle
*NL*
to
the
presence
of
the
tongs
and
say
,
``
Like
it
!
''
and
cock
his
eye
to
one
*NL*
side
or
see
if
Roxy
was
observed
;
then
,
``
Awnt
it
!
''
and
cock
his
eye
*NL*
again
;
then
,
``
Hab
it
!
''
with
another
furtive
glance
;
and
finally
,
``
Take
*NL*
it
!
''
--
and
the
prize
was
his
.
The
next
moment
the
heavy
implement
was
*NL*
raised
aloft
;
the
next
,
there
was
a
crash
and
a
squall
,
and
the
cat
was
*NL*
off
on
three
legs
to
meet
an
engagement
;
Roxy
would
arrive
just
as
the
*NL*
lamp
or
a
window
went
to
irremediable
smash
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
got
all
the
petting
,
Chambers
got
none
.
Tom
got
all
the
delicacies
,
*NL*
Chambers
got
mush
and
milk
,
and
clabber
without
sugar
.
In
consequence
*NL*
Tom
was
a
sickly
child
and
Chambers
was
n't
.
Tom
was
``
fractious
,
''
as
Roxy
*NL*
called
it
,
and
overbearing
;
Chambers
was
meek
and
docile
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
all
her
splendid
common
sense
and
practical
everyday
ability
,
Roxy
*NL*
was
a
doting
fool
of
a
mother
.
She
was
this
toward
her
child
--
and
she
*NL*
was
also
more
than
this
:
by
the
fiction
created
by
herself
,
he
was
*NL*
become
her
master
;
the
necessity
of
recognizing
this
relation
outwardly
*NL*
and
of
perfecting
herself
in
the
forms
required
to
express
the
*NL*
recognition
,
had
moved
her
to
such
diligence
and
faithfulness
in
*NL*
practicing
these
forms
that
this
exercise
soon
concreted
itself
into
*NL*
habit
;
it
became
automatic
and
unconscious
;
then
a
natural
result
*NL*
followed
:
deceptions
intended
solely
for
others
gradually
grew
*NL*
practically
into
self-deceptions
as
well
;
the
mock
reverence
became
real
*NL*
reverence
,
the
mock
homage
real
homage
;
the
little
counterfeit
rift
of
*NL*
separation
between
imitation-slave
and
imitation-master
widened
and
*NL*
widened
,
and
became
an
abyss
,
and
a
very
real
one
--
and
on
one
side
of
it
*NL*
stood
Roxy
,
the
dupe
of
her
own
deceptions
,
and
on
the
other
stood
her
*NL*
child
,
no
longer
a
usurper
to
her
,
but
her
accepted
and
recognized
*NL*
master
.
He
was
her
darling
,
her
master
,
and
her
deity
all
in
one
,
and
in
*NL*
her
worship
of
him
she
forgot
who
she
was
and
what
he
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
babyhood
Tom
cuffed
and
banged
and
scratched
Chambers
unrebuked
,
and
*NL*
Chambers
early
learned
that
between
meekly
bearing
it
and
resenting
it
,
*NL*
the
advantage
all
lay
with
the
former
policy
.
The
few
times
that
his
*NL*
persecutions
had
moved
him
beyond
control
and
made
him
fight
back
had
*NL*
cost
him
very
dear
at
headquarters
;
not
at
the
hands
of
Roxy
,
for
if
she
*NL*
ever
went
beyond
scolding
him
sharply
for
``
forgett
'n'
who
his
young
*NL*
marster
was
,
''
she
at
least
never
extended
her
punishment
beyond
a
box
on
*NL*
the
ear
.
No
,
Percy
Driscoll
was
the
person
.
He
told
Chambers
that
under
*NL*
no
provocation
whatever
was
he
privileged
to
lift
his
hand
against
his
*NL*
little
master
.
Chambers
overstepped
the
line
three
times
,
and
got
three
*NL*
such
convincing
canings
from
the
man
who
was
his
father
and
did
n't
know
*NL*
it
,
that
he
took
Tom
's
cruelties
in
all
humility
after
that
,
and
made
no
*NL*
more
experiments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
the
house
the
two
boys
were
together
all
through
their
boyhood
.
*NL*
Chambers
was
strong
beyond
his
years
,
and
a
good
fighter
;
strong
because
*NL*
he
was
coarsely
fed
and
hard
worked
about
the
house
,
and
a
good
fighter
*NL*
because
Tom
furnished
him
plenty
of
practice
--
on
white
boys
whom
he
*NL*
hated
and
was
afraid
of
.
Chambers
was
his
constant
bodyguard
,
to
and
*NL*
from
school
;
he
was
present
on
the
playground
at
recess
to
protect
his
*NL*
charge
.
He
fought
himself
into
such
a
formidable
reputation
,
by
and
by
,
*NL*
that
Tom
could
have
changed
clothes
with
him
,
and
``
ridden
in
peace
,
''
like
*NL*
Sir
Kay
in
Launcelot
's
armor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
good
at
games
of
skill
,
too
.
Tom
staked
him
with
marbles
to
play
*NL*
``
keeps
''
with
,
and
then
took
all
the
winnings
away
from
him
.
In
the
winter
*NL*
season
Chambers
was
on
hand
,
in
Tom
's
worn-out
clothes
,
with
``
holy
''
red
*NL*
mittens
,
and
``
holy
''
shoes
,
and
pants
``
holy
''
at
the
knees
and
seat
,
to
*NL*
drag
a
sled
up
the
hill
for
Tom
,
warmly
clad
,
to
ride
down
on
;
but
he
*NL*
never
got
a
ride
himself
.
He
built
snowmen
and
snow
fortifications
under
*NL*
Tom
's
directions
.
He
was
Tom
's
patient
target
when
Tom
wanted
to
do
some
*NL*
snowballing
,
but
the
target
could
n't
fire
back
.
Chambers
carried
Tom
's
*NL*
skates
to
the
river
and
strapped
them
on
him
,
then
trotted
around
after
*NL*
him
on
the
ice
,
so
as
to
be
on
hand
when
he
wanted
;
but
he
was
n't
ever
*NL*
asked
to
try
the
skates
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
summer
the
pet
pastime
of
the
boys
of
Dawson
's
Landing
was
to
steal
*NL*
apples
,
peaches
,
and
melons
from
the
farmer
's
fruit
wagons
--
mainly
on
*NL*
account
of
the
risk
they
ran
of
getting
their
heads
laid
open
with
the
*NL*
butt
of
the
farmer
's
whip
.
Tom
was
a
distinguished
adept
at
these
*NL*
thefts
--
by
proxy
.
Chambers
did
his
stealing
,
and
got
the
peach
stones
,
*NL*
apple
cores
,
and
melon
rinds
for
his
share
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
always
made
Chambers
go
in
swimming
with
him
,
and
stay
by
him
as
a
*NL*
protection
.
When
Tom
had
had
enough
,
he
would
slip
out
and
tie
knots
in
*NL*
Chamber
's
shirt
,
dip
the
knots
in
the
water
and
make
them
hard
to
undo
,
*NL*
then
dress
himself
and
sit
by
and
laugh
while
the
naked
shiverer
tugged
*NL*
at
the
stubborn
knots
with
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
did
his
humble
comrade
these
various
ill
turns
partly
out
of
native
*NL*
viciousness
,
and
partly
because
he
hated
him
for
his
superiorities
of
*NL*
physique
and
pluck
,
and
for
his
manifold
cleverness
.
Tom
could
n't
dive
,
*NL*
for
it
gave
him
splitting
headaches
.
Chambers
could
dive
without
*NL*
inconvenience
,
and
was
fond
of
doing
it
.
He
excited
so
much
admiration
,
*NL*
one
day
,
among
a
crowd
of
white
boys
,
by
throwing
back
somersaults
from
*NL*
the
stern
of
a
canoe
,
that
it
wearied
Tom
's
spirit
,
and
at
last
he
shoved
*NL*
the
canoe
underneath
Chambers
while
he
was
in
the
air
--
so
he
came
down
on
*NL*
his
head
in
the
canoe
bottom
;
and
while
he
lay
unconscious
,
several
of
*NL*
Tom
's
ancient
adversaries
saw
that
their
long-desired
opportunity
was
*NL*
come
,
and
they
gave
the
false
heir
such
a
drubbing
that
with
Chamber
's
*NL*
best
help
he
was
hardly
able
to
drag
himself
home
afterward
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
boys
was
fifteen
and
upward
,
Tom
was
``
showing
off
''
in
the
river
*NL*
one
day
,
when
he
was
taken
with
a
cramp
,
and
shouted
for
help
.
It
was
a
*NL*
common
trick
with
the
boys
--
particularly
if
a
stranger
was
present
--
to
*NL*
pretend
a
cramp
and
howl
for
help
;
then
when
the
stranger
came
tearing
*NL*
hand
over
hand
to
the
rescue
,
the
howler
would
go
on
struggling
and
*NL*
howling
till
he
was
close
at
hand
,
then
replace
the
howl
with
a
sarcastic
*NL*
smile
and
swim
blandly
away
,
while
the
town
boys
assailed
the
dupe
with
a
*NL*
volley
of
jeers
and
laughter
.
Tom
had
never
tried
this
joke
as
yet
,
but
*NL*
was
supposed
to
be
trying
it
now
,
so
the
boys
held
warily
back
;
but
*NL*
Chambers
believed
his
master
was
in
earnest
;
therefore
,
he
swam
out
,
and
*NL*
arrived
in
time
,
unfortunately
,
and
saved
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
last
feather
.
Tom
had
managed
to
endure
everything
else
,
*NL*
but
to
have
to
remain
publicly
and
permanently
under
such
an
obligation
*NL*
as
this
to
a
nigger
,
and
to
this
nigger
of
all
niggers
--
this
was
too
*NL*
much
.
He
heaped
insults
upon
Chambers
for
``
pretending
''
to
think
he
was
in
*NL*
earnest
in
calling
for
help
,
and
said
that
anybody
but
a
blockheaded
*NL*
nigger
would
have
known
he
was
funning
and
left
him
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
enemies
were
in
strong
force
here
,
so
they
came
out
with
their
*NL*
opinions
quite
freely
.
They
laughed
at
him
,
and
called
him
coward
,
liar
,
*NL*
sneak
,
and
other
sorts
of
pet
names
,
and
told
him
they
meant
to
call
*NL*
Chambers
by
a
new
name
after
this
,
and
make
it
common
in
the
town
--
``
Tom
*NL*
Driscoll
's
nigger
pappy
,
''
--
to
signify
that
he
had
had
a
second
birth
into
*NL*
this
life
,
and
that
Chambers
was
the
author
of
his
new
being
.
Tom
grew
*NL*
frantic
under
these
taunts
,
and
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knock
their
heads
off
,
Chambers
!
Knock
their
heads
off
!
What
do
you
*NL*
stand
there
with
your
hands
in
your
pockets
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chambers
expostulated
,
and
said
,
``
But
,
Marse
Tom
,
dey
's
too
many
of
*NL*
'em
--
dey
's
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
Marse
Tom
,
do
n't
make
me
!
Dey
's
so
many
of
'em
dat
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
sprang
at
him
and
drove
his
pocketknife
into
him
two
or
three
times
*NL*
before
the
boys
could
snatch
him
away
and
give
the
wounded
lad
a
chance
*NL*
to
escape
.
He
was
considerably
hurt
,
but
not
seriously
.
If
the
blade
had
*NL*
been
a
little
longer
,
his
career
would
have
ended
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
long
ago
taught
Roxy
``
her
place
.
''
It
had
been
many
a
day
now
*NL*
since
she
had
ventured
a
caress
or
a
fondling
epithet
in
his
quarter
.
*NL*
Such
things
,
from
a
``
nigger
,
''
were
repulsive
to
him
,
and
she
had
been
*NL*
warned
to
keep
her
distance
and
remember
who
she
was
.
She
saw
her
*NL*
darling
gradually
cease
from
being
her
son
,
she
saw
THAT
detail
perish
*NL*
utterly
;
all
that
was
left
was
master
--
master
,
pure
and
simple
,
and
it
*NL*
was
not
a
gentle
mastership
,
either
.
She
saw
herself
sink
from
the
*NL*
sublime
height
of
motherhood
to
the
somber
depths
of
unmodified
slavery
,
*NL*
the
abyss
of
separation
between
her
and
her
boy
was
complete
.
She
was
*NL*
merely
his
chattel
now
,
his
convenience
,
his
dog
,
his
cringing
and
*NL*
helpless
slave
,
the
humble
and
unresisting
victim
of
his
capricious
*NL*
temper
and
vicious
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
she
could
not
go
to
sleep
,
even
when
worn
out
with
fatigue
,
*NL*
because
her
rage
boiled
so
high
over
the
day
's
experiences
with
her
boy
.
*NL*
She
would
mumble
and
mutter
to
herself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
struck
me
en
I
war
n't
no
way
to
blame
--
struck
me
in
de
face
,
right
*NL*
before
folks
.
En
he
's
al
`
ays
callin
'
me
nigger
wench
,
en
hussy
,
en
all
*NL*
dem
mean
names
,
when
I
's
doin
'
de
very
bes
'
I
kin
.
Oh
,
Lord
,
I
done
so
*NL*
much
for
him
--
I
lif
'
him
away
up
to
what
he
is
--
en
dis
is
what
I
git
for
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
when
some
outrage
of
peculiar
offensiveness
stung
her
to
the
*NL*
heart
,
she
would
plan
schemes
of
vengeance
and
revel
in
the
fancied
*NL*
spectacle
of
his
exposure
to
the
world
as
an
imposter
and
a
slave
;
but
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
these
joys
fear
would
strike
her
;
she
had
made
him
too
*NL*
strong
;
she
could
prove
nothing
,
and
--
heavens
,
she
might
get
sold
down
*NL*
the
river
for
her
pains
!
So
her
schemes
always
went
for
nothing
,
and
she
*NL*
laid
them
aside
in
impotent
rage
against
the
fates
,
and
against
herself
*NL*
for
playing
the
fool
on
that
fatal
September
day
in
not
providing
herself
*NL*
with
a
witness
for
use
in
the
day
when
such
a
thing
might
be
needed
for
*NL*
the
appeasing
of
her
vengeance-hungry
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
the
moment
Tom
happened
to
be
good
to
her
,
and
kind
--
and
this
*NL*
occurred
every
now
and
then
--
all
her
sore
places
were
healed
,
and
she
was
*NL*
happy
;
happy
and
proud
,
for
this
was
her
son
,
her
nigger
son
,
lording
it
*NL*
among
the
whites
and
securely
avenging
their
crimes
against
her
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
grand
funerals
in
Dawson
's
Landing
that
fall
--
the
fall
of
*NL*
1845
.
One
was
that
of
Colonel
Cecil
Burleigh
Essex
,
the
other
that
of
*NL*
Percy
Driscoll
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
deathbed
Driscoll
set
Roxy
free
and
delivered
his
idolized
*NL*
ostensible
son
solemnly
into
the
keeping
of
his
brother
,
the
judge
,
and
*NL*
his
wife
.
Those
childless
people
were
glad
to
get
him
.
Childless
people
*NL*
are
not
difficult
to
please
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Driscoll
had
gone
privately
to
his
brother
,
a
month
before
,
and
*NL*
bought
Chambers
.
He
had
heard
that
Tom
had
been
trying
to
get
his
father
*NL*
to
sell
the
boy
down
the
river
,
and
he
wanted
to
prevent
the
scandal
--
for
*NL*
public
sentiment
did
not
approve
of
that
way
of
treating
family
servants
*NL*
for
light
cause
or
for
no
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Percy
Driscoll
had
worn
himself
out
in
trying
to
save
his
great
*NL*
speculative
landed
estate
,
and
had
died
without
succeeding
.
He
was
hardly
*NL*
in
his
grave
before
the
boom
collapsed
and
left
his
envied
young
devil
of
*NL*
an
heir
a
pauper
.
But
that
was
nothing
;
his
uncle
told
him
he
should
be
*NL*
his
heir
and
have
all
his
fortune
when
he
died
;
so
Tom
was
comforted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Roxy
had
no
home
now
;
so
she
resolved
to
go
around
and
say
good-by
to
her
*NL*
friends
and
then
clear
out
and
see
the
world
--
that
is
to
say
,
she
would
*NL*
go
chambermaiding
on
a
steamboat
,
the
darling
ambition
of
her
race
and
*NL*
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
last
call
was
on
the
black
giant
,
Jasper
.
She
found
him
chopping
*NL*
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
's
winter
provision
of
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
was
chatting
with
him
when
Roxy
arrived
.
He
asked
her
how
she
*NL*
could
bear
to
go
off
chambermaiding
and
leave
her
boys
;
and
chaffingly
*NL*
offered
to
copy
off
a
series
of
their
fingerprints
,
reaching
up
to
their
*NL*
twelfth
year
,
for
her
to
remember
them
by
;
but
she
sobered
in
a
moment
,
*NL*
wondering
if
he
suspected
anything
;
then
she
said
she
believed
she
did
n't
*NL*
want
them
.
Wilson
said
to
himself
,
``
The
drop
of
black
blood
in
her
is
*NL*
superstitious
;
she
thinks
there
's
some
devilry
,
some
witch
business
about
*NL*
my
glass
mystery
somewhere
;
she
used
to
come
here
with
an
old
horseshoe
*NL*
in
her
hand
;
it
could
have
been
an
accident
,
but
I
doubt
it
.

Mrs.
York
Driscoll
enjoyed
two
years
of
bliss
with
that
prize
,
*NL*
Tom
--
bliss
that
was
troubled
a
little
at
times
,
it
is
true
,
but
bliss
*NL*
nevertheless
;
then
she
died
,
and
her
husband
and
his
childless
sister
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Pratt
,
continued
this
bliss-business
at
the
old
stand
.
Tom
was
*NL*
petted
and
indulged
and
spoiled
to
his
entire
content
--
or
nearly
that
.
*NL*
This
went
on
till
he
was
nineteen
,
then
he
was
sent
to
Yale
.
He
went
*NL*
handsomely
equipped
with
``
conditions
,
''
but
otherwise
he
was
not
an
object
*NL*
of
distinction
there
.
He
remained
at
Yale
two
years
,
and
then
threw
up
*NL*
the
struggle
.
He
came
home
with
his
manners
a
good
deal
improved
;
he
had
*NL*
lost
his
surliness
and
brusqueness
,
and
was
rather
pleasantly
soft
and
*NL*
smooth
,
now
;
he
was
furtively
,
and
sometimes
openly
,
ironical
of
speech
,
*NL*
and
given
to
gently
touching
people
on
the
raw
,
but
he
did
it
with
a
*NL*
good-natured
semiconscious
air
that
carried
it
off
safely
,
and
kept
him
*NL*
from
getting
into
trouble
.
He
was
as
indolent
as
ever
and
showed
no
very
*NL*
strenuous
desire
to
hunt
up
an
occupation
.
People
argued
from
this
that
*NL*
he
preferred
to
be
supported
by
his
uncle
until
his
uncle
's
shoes
should
*NL*
become
vacant
.
He
brought
back
one
or
two
new
habits
with
him
,
one
of
*NL*
which
he
rather
openly
practiced
--
tippling
--
but
concealed
another
,
which
*NL*
was
gambling
.
It
would
not
do
to
gamble
where
his
uncle
could
hear
of
*NL*
it
;
he
knew
that
quite
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
Eastern
polish
was
not
popular
among
the
young
people
.
They
could
*NL*
have
endured
it
,
perhaps
,
if
Tom
had
stopped
there
;
but
he
wore
gloves
,
*NL*
and
that
they
could
n't
stand
,
and
would
n't
;
so
he
was
mainly
without
*NL*
society
.
He
brought
home
with
him
a
suit
of
clothes
of
such
exquisite
*NL*
style
and
cut
in
fashion
--
Eastern
fashion
,
city
fashion
--
that
it
filled
*NL*
everybody
with
anguish
and
was
regarded
as
a
peculiarly
wanton
affront
.
*NL*
He
enjoyed
the
feeling
which
he
was
exciting
,
and
paraded
the
town
serene
*NL*
and
happy
all
day
;
but
the
young
fellows
set
a
tailor
to
work
that
night
,
*NL*
and
when
Tom
started
out
on
his
parade
next
morning
,
he
found
the
old
*NL*
deformed
Negro
bell
ringer
straddling
along
in
his
wake
tricked
out
in
a
*NL*
flamboyant
curtain-calico
exaggeration
of
his
finery
,
and
imitating
his
*NL*
fancy
Eastern
graces
as
well
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
surrendered
,
and
after
that
clothed
himself
in
the
local
fashion
.
But
*NL*
the
dull
country
town
was
tiresome
to
him
,
since
his
acquaintanceship
*NL*
with
livelier
regions
,
and
it
grew
daily
more
and
more
so
.
He
began
to
*NL*
make
little
trips
to
St.
Louis
for
refreshment
.
There
he
found
*NL*
companionship
to
suit
him
,
and
pleasures
to
his
taste
,
along
with
more
*NL*
freedom
,
in
some
particulars
,
than
he
could
have
at
home
.
So
,
during
the
*NL*
next
two
years
,
his
visits
to
the
city
grew
in
frequency
and
his
*NL*
tarryings
there
grew
steadily
longer
in
duration
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
getting
into
deep
waters
.
He
was
taking
chances
,
privately
,
which
*NL*
might
get
him
into
trouble
some
day
--
in
fact
,
_
did
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Driscoll
had
retired
from
the
bench
and
from
all
business
*NL*
activities
in
1850
,
and
had
now
been
comfortably
idle
three
years
.
He
was
*NL*
president
of
the
Freethinkers
'
Society
,
and
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
was
the
*NL*
other
member
.
The
society
's
weekly
discussions
were
now
the
old
lawyer
's
*NL*
main
interest
in
life
.
Pudd
`
nhead
was
still
toiling
in
obscurity
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
ladder
,
under
the
blight
of
that
unlucky
remark
which
he
*NL*
had
let
fall
twenty-three
years
before
about
the
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Driscoll
was
his
friend
,
and
claimed
that
he
had
a
mind
above
the
*NL*
average
,
but
that
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
judge
's
whims
,
and
it
failed
*NL*
to
modify
the
public
opinion
.
Or
rather
,
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
*NL*
it
failed
,
but
there
was
another
and
better
one
.
If
the
judge
had
stopped
*NL*
with
bare
assertion
,
it
would
have
had
a
good
deal
of
effect
;
but
he
made
*NL*
the
mistake
of
trying
to
prove
his
position
.
For
some
years
Wilson
had
*NL*
been
privately
at
work
on
a
whimsical
almanac
,
for
his
amusement
--
a
*NL*
calendar
,
with
a
little
dab
of
ostensible
philosophy
,
usually
in
ironical
*NL*
form
,
appended
to
each
date
;
and
the
judge
thought
that
these
quips
and
*NL*
fancies
of
Wilson
's
were
neatly
turned
and
cute
;
so
he
carried
a
handful
*NL*
of
them
around
one
day
,
and
read
them
to
some
of
the
chief
citizens
.
But
*NL*
irony
was
not
for
those
people
;
their
mental
vision
was
not
focused
for
*NL*
it
.
They
read
those
playful
trifles
in
the
solidest
terms
,
and
decided
*NL*
without
hesitancy
that
if
there
had
ever
been
any
doubt
that
Dave
Wilson
*NL*
was
a
pudd
`
nhead
--
which
there
had
n't
--
this
revelation
removed
that
doubt
*NL*
for
good
and
all
.
That
is
just
the
way
in
this
world
;
an
enemy
can
partly
*NL*
ruin
a
man
,
but
it
takes
a
good-natured
injudicious
friend
to
complete
*NL*
the
thing
and
make
it
perfect
.
After
this
the
judge
felt
tenderer
than
*NL*
ever
toward
Wilson
,
and
surer
than
ever
that
his
calendar
had
merit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Driscoll
could
be
a
freethinker
and
still
hold
his
place
in
society
*NL*
because
he
was
the
person
of
most
consequence
to
the
community
,
and
*NL*
therefore
could
venture
to
go
his
own
way
and
follow
out
his
own
notions
.
*NL*
The
other
member
of
his
pet
organization
was
allowed
the
like
liberty
*NL*
because
he
was
a
cipher
in
the
estimation
of
the
public
,
and
nobody
*NL*
attached
any
importance
to
what
he
thought
or
did
.
He
was
liked
,
he
was
*NL*
welcome
enough
all
around
,
but
he
simply
did
n't
count
for
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Widow
Cooper
--
affectionately
called
``
Aunt
Patsy
''
by
everybody
--
lived
*NL*
in
a
snug
and
comely
cottage
with
her
daughter
Rowena
,
who
was
nineteen
,
*NL*
romantic
,
amiable
,
and
very
pretty
,
but
otherwise
of
no
consequence
.
*NL*
Rowena
had
a
couple
of
young
brothers
--
also
of
no
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
widow
had
a
large
spare
room
,
which
she
let
to
a
lodger
,
with
board
,
*NL*
when
she
could
find
one
,
but
this
room
had
been
empty
for
a
year
now
,
to
*NL*
her
sorrow
.
Her
income
was
only
sufficient
for
the
family
support
,
and
*NL*
she
needed
the
lodging
money
for
trifling
luxuries
.
But
now
,
at
last
,
on
*NL*
a
flaming
June
day
,
she
found
herself
happy
;
her
tedious
wait
was
ended
;
*NL*
her
year-worn
advertisement
had
been
answered
;
and
not
by
a
village
*NL*
applicant
,
no
,
no
!
--
this
letter
was
from
away
off
yonder
in
the
dim
great
*NL*
world
to
the
North
;
it
was
from
St.
Louis
.
She
sat
on
her
porch
gazing
*NL*
out
with
unseeing
eyes
upon
the
shining
reaches
of
the
mighty
*NL*
Mississippi
,
her
thoughts
steeped
in
her
good
fortune
.
Indeed
it
was
*NL*
specially
good
fortune
,
for
she
was
to
have
two
lodgers
instead
of
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
read
the
letter
to
the
family
,
and
Rowena
had
danced
away
to
see
*NL*
to
the
cleaning
and
airing
of
the
room
by
the
slave
woman
,
Nancy
,
and
the
*NL*
boys
had
rushed
abroad
in
the
town
to
spread
the
great
news
,
for
it
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
public
interest
,
and
the
public
would
wonder
and
not
be
pleased
*NL*
if
not
informed
.
Presently
Rowena
returned
,
all
ablush
with
joyous
*NL*
excitement
,
and
begged
for
a
rereading
of
the
letter
.
It
was
framed
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
HONORED
MADAM
:
My
brother
and
I
have
seen
your
advertisement
,
by
chance
,
*NL*
and
beg
leave
to
take
the
room
you
offer
.
We
are
twenty-four
years
of
*NL*
age
and
twins
.
We
are
Italians
by
birth
,
but
have
lived
long
in
the
*NL*
various
countries
of
Europe
,
and
several
years
in
the
United
States
.
Our
*NL*
names
are
Luigi
and
Angelo
Capello
.
You
desire
but
one
guest
;
but
,
dear
*NL*
madam
,
if
you
will
allow
us
to
pay
for
two
,
we
will
not
incommode
you
.
*NL*
We
shall
be
down
Thursday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Italians

Just
think
,
Ma
--
there
's
never

and
everybody
will
be
dying
to
see
them

and
they
're
all

of
that

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

been

everywhere

There
's
never
been
a
*NL*
traveler
in
this

before

Ma
,
I
should
n't
wonder
if
they
've
seen
*NL*
kings
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

ca
n't
tell

they
'll
make
stir
enough
,
without

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
's
of
course

They
're

names
;

so
*NL*
grand
and
foreign
--
not
like
Jones
and
Robinson
and
such
.
Thursday
they
*NL*
are
coming
,
and
this
is
only
Tuesday
;
it
's
a
cruel
long
time
to
wait
.
*NL*
Here
comes
Judge
Driscoll
in
at
the
gate

He
's
heard
about
it

The
judge
was
full
of
congratulations
and
curiosity
.
The
letter
was
read
*NL*
and
discussed
.
Soon
Justice
Robinson
arrived
with
more
congratulations
,
*NL*
and
there
was
a
new
reading
and
a
new
discussion
.
This
was
the
beginning
.
*NL*
Neighbor
after
neighbor
,
of
both
sexes
,
followed
,
and
the
procession
*NL*
drifted
in
and
out
all
day
and
evening
and
all
Wednesday
and
Thursday
.
*NL*
The
letter
was
read
and
reread
until
it
was
nearly
worn
out
;
everybody
*NL*
admired
its
courtly
and
gracious
tone
,
and
smooth
and
practiced
style
,
*NL*
everybody
was
sympathetic
and
excited
,
and
the
Coopers
were
steeped
in
*NL*
happiness
all
the
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boats
were
very
uncertain
in
low
water
in
these
primitive
times
.
This
*NL*
time
the
Thursday
boat
had
not
arrived
at
ten
at
night
--
so
the
people
*NL*
had
waited
at
the
landing
all
day
for
nothing
;
they
were
driven
to
their
*NL*
homes
by
a
heavy
storm
without
having
had
a
view
of
the
illustrious
*NL*
foreigners
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eleven
o'clock
came
;
and
the
Cooper
house
was
the
only
one
in
the
town
*NL*
that
still
had
lights
burning
.
The
rain
and
thunder
were
booming
yet
,
*NL*
and
the
anxious
family
were
still
waiting
,
still
hoping
.
At
last
there
*NL*
was
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
the
family
jumped
to
open
it
.
Two
Negro
men
*NL*
entered
,
each
carrying
a
trunk
,
and
proceeded
upstairs
toward
the
guest
*NL*
room
.
Then
entered
the
twins
--
the
handsomest
,
the
best
dressed
,
the
most
*NL*
distinguished-looking
pair
of
young
fellows
the
West
had
ever
seen
.
One
*NL*
was
a
little
fairer
than
the
other
,
but
otherwise
they
were
exact
*NL*
duplicates
.

Pudd

Wilson
's
Calendar
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
breakfast
in
the
morning
,
the
twins
'
charm
of
manner
and
easy
and
*NL*
polished
bearing
made
speedy
conquest
of
the
family
's
good
graces
.
All
*NL*
constraint
and
formality
quickly
disappeared
,
and
the
friendliest
feeling
*NL*
succeeded
.
Aunt
Patsy
called
them
by
their
Christian
names
almost
from
*NL*
the
beginning
.
She
was
full
of
the
keenest
curiosity
about
them
,
and
*NL*
showed
it
;
they
responded
by
talking
about
themselves
,
which
pleased
her
*NL*
greatly
.
It
presently
appeared
that
in
their
early
youth
they
had
known
*NL*
poverty
and
hardship
.
As
the
talk
wandered
along
,
the
old
lady
watched
*NL*
for
the
right
place
to
drop
in
a
question
or
two
concerning
that
matter
,
*NL*
and
when
she
found
it
,
she
said
to
the
blond
twin
,
who
was
now
doing
the
*NL*
biographies
in
his
turn
while
the
brunette
one
rested
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
ai
n't
asking
what
I
ought
not
to
ask
,
Mr.
Angelo
,
how
did
you
come
*NL*
to
be
so
friendless
and
in
such
trouble
when
you
were
little
?
Do
you
mind
*NL*
telling
?
But
do
n't
,
if
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
do
n't
mind
it
at
all
,
madam
;
in
our
case
it
was
merely
*NL*
misfortune
,
and
nobody
's
fault
.
Our
parents
were
well
to
do
,
there
in
*NL*
Italy
,
and
we
were
their
only
child
.
We
were
of
the

Rowena
's
heart
gave
a
great
bound
,
her
nostrils
expanded
,
and
*NL*
a
fine
light
played
in
her
eyes
--
``
and
when
the
war
broke
out
,
my
father
*NL*
was
on
the
losing
side
and
had
to
fly
for
his
life
.
His
estates
were
*NL*
confiscated
,
his
personal
property
seized
,
and
there
we
were
,
in
Germany
,
*NL*
strangers
,
friendless
,
and
in
fact
paupers
.
My
brother
and
I
were
ten
*NL*
years
old
,
and
well
educated
for
that
age
,
very
studious
,
very
fond
of
*NL*
our
books
,
and
well
grounded
in
the
German
,
French
,
Spanish
,
and
English
*NL*
languages
.
Also
,
we
were
marvelous
musical
prodigies
--
if
you
will
allow
*NL*
me
to
say
it
,
it
being
only
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
father
survived
his
misfortunes
only
a
month
,
our
mother
soon
*NL*
followed
him
,
and
we
were
alone
in
the
world
.
Our
parents
could
have
*NL*
made
themselves
comfortable
by
exhibiting
us
as
a
show
,
and
they
had
many
*NL*
and
large
offers
;
but
the
thought
revolted
their
pride
,
and
they
said
*NL*
they
would
starve
and
die
first
.
But
what
they
would
n't
consent
to
do
,
*NL*
we
had
to
do
without
the
formality
of
consent
.
We
were
seized
for
the
*NL*
debts
occasioned
by
their
illness
and
their
funerals
,
and
placed
among
*NL*
the
attractions
of
a
cheap
museum
in
Berlin
to
earn
the
liquidation
*NL*
money
.
It
took
us
two
years
to
get
out
of
that
slavery
.
We
traveled
all
*NL*
about
Germany
,
receiving
no
wages
,
and
not
even
our
keep
.
We
had
to
be
*NL*
exhibited
for
nothing
,
and
beg
our
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
madam
,
the
rest
is
not
of
much
consequence
.
When
we
escaped
from
*NL*
that
slavery
at
twelve
years
of
age
,
we
were
in
some
respects
men
.
*NL*
Experience
had
taught
us
some
valuable
things
;
among
others
,
how
to
take
*NL*
care
of
ourselves
,
how
to
avoid
and
defeat
sharks
and
sharpers
,
and
how
*NL*
to
conduct
our
own
business
for
our
own
profit
and
without
other
people
's
*NL*
help
.
We
traveled
everywhere
--
years
and
years
--
picking
up
smatterings
*NL*
of
strange
tongues
,
familiarizing
ourselves
with
strange
sights
and
*NL*
strange
customs
,
accumulating
an
education
of
a
wide
and
varied
and
*NL*
curious
sort
.
It
was
a
pleasant
life
.
We
went
to
Venice
--
to
London
,
*NL*
Paris
,
Russia
,
India
,
China
,
Japan

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
Nancy
,
the
slave
woman
,
thrust
her
head
in
at
the
door
and
*NL*
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ole
Missus

''
She
indicated
the
twins
with
a
nod
of
*NL*
her
head
,
and
tucked
it
back
out
of
sight
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
proud
occasion
for
the
widow
,
and
she
promised
herself
high
*NL*
satisfaction
in
showing
off
her
fine
foreign
birds
before
her
neighbors
*NL*
and
friends
--
simple
folk
who
had
hardly
ever
seen
a
foreigner
of
any
*NL*
kind
,
and
never
one
of
any
distinction
or
style
.
Yet
her
feeling
was
*NL*
moderate
indeed
when
contrasted
with
Rowena
's
.
Rowena
was
in
the
clouds
,
*NL*
she
walked
on
air
;
this
was
to
be
the
greatest
day
,
the
most
romantic
*NL*
episode
in
the
colorless
history
of
that
dull
country
town
.
She
was
to
*NL*
be
familiarly
near
the
source
of
its
glory
and
feel
the
full
flood
of
it
*NL*
pour
over
her
and
about
her
;
the
other
girls
could
only
gaze
and
envy
,
*NL*
not
partake
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
widow
was
ready
,
Rowena
was
ready
,
so
also
were
the
foreigners
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
moved
along
the
hall
,
the
twins
in
advance
,
and
entered
the
*NL*
open
parlor
door
,
whence
issued
a
low
hum
of
conversation
.
The
twins
took
*NL*
a
position
near
the
door
,
the
widow
stood
at
Luigi
's
side
,
Rowena
stood
*NL*
beside
Angelo
,
and
the
march-past
and
the
introductions
began
.
The
widow
*NL*
was
all
smiles
and
contentment
.
She
received
the
procession
and
passed
*NL*
it
on
to
Rowena
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

``

on

of

and
a

pleasant

on

of
Count

*NL*
None
of
these
visitors
was
at
ease
,
but
,
being
honest
people
,
they
did
n't
*NL*
pretend
to
be
.
None
of
them
had
ever
seen
a
person
bearing
a
title
of
*NL*
nobility
before
,
and
none
had
been
expecting
to
see
one
now
,
consequently
*NL*
the
title
came
upon
them
as
a
kind
of
pile-driving
surprise
and
caught
*NL*
them
unprepared
.
A
few
tried
to
rise
to
the
emergency
,
and
got
out
an
*NL*
awkward
``
My
lord
,
''
or
``
Your
lordship
,
''
or
something
of
that
sort
,
but
the
*NL*
great
majority
were
overwhelmed
by
the
unaccustomed
word
and
its
dim
and
*NL*
awful
associations
with
gilded
courts
and
stately
ceremony
and
anointed
*NL*
kingship
,
so
they
only
fumbled
through
the
handshake
and
passed
on
,
*NL*
speechless
.
Now
and
then
,
as
happens
at
all
receptions
everywhere
,
a
*NL*
more
than
ordinary
friendly
soul
blocked
the
procession
and
kept
it
*NL*
waiting
while
he
inquired
how
the
brothers
liked
the
village
,
and
how
*NL*
long
they
were
going
to
stay
,
and
if
their
family
was
well
,
and
dragged
*NL*
in
the
weather
,
and
hoped
it
would
get
cooler
soon
,
and
all
that
sort
of
*NL*
thing
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
say
,
when
he
got
home
,
``
I
had
quite
a
long
*NL*
talk
with
them
''
;
but
nobody
did
or
said
anything
of
a
regrettable
kind
,
*NL*
and
so
the
great
affair
went
through
to
the
end
in
a
creditable
and
*NL*
satisfactory
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
General
conversation
followed
,
and
the
twins
drifted
about
from
group
to
*NL*
group
,
talking
easily
and
fluently
and
winning
approval
,
compelling
*NL*
admiration
and
achieving
favor
from
all
.
The
widow
followed
their
*NL*
conquering
march
with
a
proud
eye
,
and
every
now
and
then
Rowena
said
to
*NL*
herself
with
deep
satisfaction
,
``
And
to
think
they
are
ours
--
all
ours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
idle
moments
for
mother
or
daughter
.
Eager
inquiries
*NL*
concerning
the
twins
were
pouring
into
their
enchanted
ears
all
the
time
;
*NL*
each
was
the
constant
center
of
a
group
of
breathless
listeners
;
each
*NL*
recognized
that
she
knew
now
for
the
first
time
the
real
meaning
of
that
*NL*
great
word
Glory
,
and
perceived
the
stupendous
value
of
it
,
and
*NL*
understood
why
men
in
all
ages
had
been
willing
to
throw
away
meaner
*NL*
happiness
,
treasure
,
life
itself
,
to
get
a
taste
of
its
sublime
and
*NL*
supreme
joy
.
Napoleon
and
all
his
kind
stood
accounted
for
--
and
*NL*
justified
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Rowena
had
at
last
done
all
her
duty
by
the
people
in
the
parlor
,
*NL*
she
went
upstairs
to
satisfy
the
longings
of
an
overflow
meeting
there
,
*NL*
for
the
parlor
was
not
big
enough
to
hold
all
the
comers
.
Again
she
was
*NL*
besieged
by
eager
questioners
,
and
again
she
swam
in
sunset
seas
of
*NL*
glory
.
When
the
forenoon
was
nearly
gone
,
she
recognized
with
a
pang
*NL*
that
this
most
splendid
episode
of
her
life
was
almost
over
,
that
nothing
*NL*
could
prolong
it
,
that
nothing
quite
its
equal
could
ever
fall
to
her
*NL*
fortune
again
.
But
never
mind
,
it
was
sufficient
unto
itself
,
the
grand
*NL*
occasion
had
moved
on
an
ascending
scale
from
the
start
,
and
was
a
noble
*NL*
and
memorable
success
.
If
the
twins
could
but
do
some
crowning
act
now
*NL*
to
climax
it
,
something
usual
,
something
startling
,
something
to
*NL*
concentrate
upon
themselves
the
company
's
loftiest
admiration
,
something
*NL*
in
the
nature
of
an
electric
surprise
--
*NL*
*NL*
Here
a
prodigious
slam-banging
broke
out
below
,
and
everybody
rushed
down
*NL*
to
see
.
It
was
the
twins
,
knocking
out
a
classic
four-handed
piece
on
*NL*
the
piano
in
great
style
.
Rowena
was
satisfied
--
satisfied
down
to
the
*NL*
bottom
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
strangers
were
kept
long
at
the
piano
.
The
villagers
were
*NL*
astonished
and
enchanted
with
the
magnificence
of
their
performance
,
and
*NL*
could
not
bear
to
have
them
stop
.
All
the
music
that
they
had
ever
heard
*NL*
before
seemed
spiritless
prentice-work
and
barren
of
grace
and
charm
when
*NL*
compared
with
these
intoxicating
floods
of
melodious
sound
.
They
realized
*NL*
that
for
once
in
their
lives
they
were
hearing
masters
.

_
One
of
the
most
striking
differences
between
a
cat

is
that

has

The
company
broke
up
reluctantly
,
and
drifted
toward
their
several
*NL*
homes
,
chatting
with
vivacity
and
all
agreeing
that
it
would
be
many
a
*NL*
long
day
before
Dawson
's
Landing
would
see
the
equal
of
this
one
again
.
*NL*
The
twins
had
accepted
several
invitations
while
the
reception
was
in
*NL*
progress
,
and
had
also
volunteered
to
play
some
duets
at
an
amateur
*NL*
entertainment
for
the
benefit
of
a
local
charity
.
Society
was
eager
to
*NL*
receive
them
to
its
bosom
.
Judge
Driscoll
had
the
good
fortune
to
secure
*NL*
them
for
an
immediate
drive
,
and
to
be
the
first
to
display
them
in
*NL*
public
.
They
entered
his
buggy
with
him
and
were
paraded
down
the
main
*NL*
street
,
everybody
flocking
to
the
windows
and
sidewalks
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
judge
showed
the
strangers
the
new
graveyard
,
and
the
jail
,
and
where
*NL*
the
richest
man
lived
,
and
the
Freemasons
'
hall
,
and
the
Methodist
*NL*
church
,
and
the
Presbyterian
church
,
and
where
the
Baptist
church
was
*NL*
going
to
be
when
they
got
some
money
to
build
it
with
,
and
showed
them
*NL*
the
town
hall
and
the
slaughterhouse
,
and
got
out
the
independent
fire
*NL*
company
in
uniform
and
had
them
put
out
an
imaginary
fire
;
then
he
let
*NL*
them
inspect
the
muskets
of
the
militia
company
,
and
poured
out
an
*NL*
exhaustless
stream
of
enthusiasm
over
all
these
splendors
,
and
seemed
*NL*
very
well
satisfied
with
the
responses
he
got
,
for
the
twins
admired
his
*NL*
admiration
,
and
paid
him
back
the
best
they
could
,
though
they
could
have
*NL*
done
better
if
some
fifteen
or
sixteen
hundred
thousand
previous
*NL*
experiences
of
this
sort
in
various
countries
had
not
already
rubbed
off
*NL*
a
considerable
part
of
the
novelty
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
judge
laid
himself
out
hospitality
to
make
them
have
a
good
time
,
and
*NL*
if
there
was
a
defect
anywhere
,
it
was
not
his
fault
.
He
told
them
a
good
*NL*
many
humorous
anecdotes
,
and
always
forgot
the
nub
,
but
they
were
always
*NL*
able
to
furnish
it
,
for
these
yarns
were
of
a
pretty
early
vintage
,
and
*NL*
they
had
had
many
a
rejuvenating
pull
at
them
before
.
And
he
told
them
*NL*
all
about
his
several
dignities
,
and
how
he
had
held
this
and
that
and
*NL*
the
other
place
of
honor
or
profit
,
and
had
once
been
to
the
legislature
,
*NL*
and
was
now
president
of
the
Society
of
Freethinkers
.
He
said
the
*NL*
society
had
been
in
existence
four
years
,
and
already
had
two
members
,
*NL*
and
was
firmly
established
.
He
would
call
for
the
brothers
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
if
they
would
like
to
attend
a
meeting
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
he
called
for
them
,
and
on
the
way
he
told
them
all
about
*NL*
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
,
in
order
that
they
might
get
a
favorable
impression
of
*NL*
him
in
advance
and
be
prepared
to
like
him
.
This
scheme
succeeded
--
the
*NL*
favorable
impression
was
achieved
.
Later
it
was
confirmed
and
solidified
*NL*
when
Wilson
proposed
that
out
of
courtesy
to
the
strangers
the
usual
*NL*
topics
be
put
aside
and
the
hour
be
devoted
to
conversation
upon
ordinary
*NL*
subjects
and
the
cultivation
of
friendly
relations
and
good-fellowship
--
a
*NL*
proposition
which
was
put
to
vote
and
carried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
passed
quickly
away
in
lively
talk
,
and
when
it
was
ended
,
the
*NL*
lonesome
and
neglected
Wilson
was
richer
by
two
friends
than
he
had
been
*NL*
when
it
began
.
He
invited
the
twins
to
look
in
at
his
lodgings
*NL*
presently
,
after
disposing
of
an
intervening
engagement
,
and
they
*NL*
accepted
with
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
the
middle
of
the
evening
,
they
found
themselves
on
the
road
to
*NL*
his
house
.
Pudd
`
nhead
was
at
home
waiting
for
them
and
putting
in
his
*NL*
time
puzzling
over
a
thing
which
had
come
under
his
notice
that
morning
.
*NL*
The
matter
was
this
:
He
happened
to
be
up
very
early
--
at
dawn
,
in
fact
;
*NL*
and
he
crossed
the
hall
,
which
divided
his
cottage
through
the
center
,
*NL*
and
entered
a
room
to
get
something
there
.
The
window
of
the
room
had
no
*NL*
curtains
,
for
that
side
of
the
house
had
long
been
unoccupied
,
and
*NL*
through
this
window
he
caught
sight
of
something
which
surprised
and
*NL*
interested
him
.
It
was
a
young
woman
--
a
young
woman
where
properly
no
*NL*
young
woman
belonged
;
for
she
was
in
Judge
Driscoll
's
house
,
and
in
the
*NL*
bedroom
over
the
judge
's
private
study
or
sitting
room
.
This
was
young
*NL*
Tom
Driscoll
's
bedroom
.
He
and
the
judge
,
the
judge
's
widowed
sister
Mrs.
*NL*
Pratt
,
and
three
Negro
servants
were
the
only
people
who
belonged
in
the
*NL*
house
.
Who
,
then
,
might
this
young
lady
be
?
The
two
houses
were
*NL*
separated
by
an
ordinary
yard
,
with
a
low
fence
running
back
through
its
*NL*
middle
from
the
street
in
front
to
the
lane
in
the
rear
.
The
distance
*NL*
was
not
great
,
and
Wilson
was
able
to
see
the
girl
very
well
,
the
window
*NL*
shades
of
the
room
she
was
in
being
up
,
and
the
window
also
.
The
girl
had
*NL*
on
a
neat
and
trim
summer
dress
,
patterned
in
broad
stripes
of
pink
and
*NL*
white
,
and
her
bonnet
was
equipped
with
a
pink
veil
.
She
was
practicing
*NL*
steps
,
gaits
and
attitudes
,
apparently
;
she
was
doing
the
thing
*NL*
gracefully
,
and
was
very
much
absorbed
in
her
work
.
Who
could
she
be
,
and
*NL*
how
came
she
to
be
in
young
Tom
Driscoll
's
room
?
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
had
quickly
chosen
a
position
from
which
he
could
watch
the
girl
*NL*
without
running
much
risk
of
being
seen
by
her
,
and
he
remained
there
*NL*
hoping
she
would
raise
her
veil
and
betray
her
face
.
But
she
*NL*
disappointed
him
.
After
a
matter
of
twenty
minutes
she
disappeared
and
*NL*
although
he
stayed
at
his
post
half
an
hour
longer
,
she
came
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
noon
he
dropped
in
at
the
judge
's
and
talked
with
Mrs.
Pratt
about
*NL*
the
great
event
of
the
day
,
the
levee
of
the
distinguished
foreigners
at
*NL*
Aunt
Patsy
Cooper
's
.
He
asked
after
her
nephew
Tom
,
and
she
said
he
was
*NL*
on
his
way
home
and
that
she
was
expecting
him
to
arrive
a
little
before
*NL*
night
,
and
added
that
she
and
the
judge
were
gratified
to
gather
from
his
*NL*
letters
that
he
was
conducting
himself
very
nicely
and
creditably
--
at
*NL*
which
Wilson
winked
to
himself
privately
.
Wilson
did
not
ask
if
there
was
*NL*
a
newcomer
in
the
house
,
but
he
asked
questions
that
would
have
brought
*NL*
light-throwing
answers
as
to
that
matter
if
Mrs.
Pratt
had
had
any
light
*NL*
to
throw
;
so
he
went
away
satisfied
that
he
knew
of
things
that
were
*NL*
going
on
in
her
house
of
which
she
herself
was
not
aware
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
now
awaiting
for
the
twins
,
and
still
puzzling
over
the
problem
of
*NL*
who
that
girl
might
be
,
and
how
she
happened
to
be
in
that
young
fellow
's
*NL*
room
at
daybreak
in
the
morning
.

Wilson
's
Calendar
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
necessary
now
to
hunt
up
Roxy
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
she
was
set
free
and
went
away
chambermaiding
,
she
was
*NL*
thirty-five
.
She
got
a
berth
as
second
chambermaid
on
a
Cincinnati
boat
*NL*
in
the
New
Orleans
trade
,
the
_
Grand
Mogul
_
.
A
couple
of
trips
made
her
*NL*
wonted
and
easygoing
at
the
work
,
and
infatuated
her
with
the
stir
and
*NL*
adventure
and
independence
of
steamboat
life
.
Then
she
was
promoted
and
*NL*
become
head
chambermaid
.
She
was
a
favorite
with
the
officers
,
and
*NL*
exceedingly
proud
of
their
joking
and
friendly
way
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
eight
years
she
served
three
parts
of
the
year
on
that
boat
,
and
*NL*
the
winters
on
a
Vicksburg
packet
.
But
now
for
two
months
,
she
had
had
*NL*
rheumatism
in
her
arms
,
and
was
obliged
to
let
the
washtub
alone
.
So
she
*NL*
resigned
.
But
she
was
well
fixed
--
rich
,
as
she
would
have
described
it
;
*NL*
for
she
had
lived
a
steady
life
,
and
had
banked
four
dollars
every
month
*NL*
in
New
Orleans
as
a
provision
for
her
old
age
.
She
said
in
the
start
*NL*
that
she
had
``
put
shoes
on
one
bar
`
footed
nigger
to
tromple
on
her
with
,
''
*NL*
and
that
one
mistake
like
that
was
enough
;
she
would
be
independent
of
*NL*
the
human
race
thenceforth
forevermore
if
hard
work
and
economy
could
*NL*
accomplish
it
.
When
the
boat
touched
the
levee
at
New
Orleans
she
bade
*NL*
good-by
to
her
comrades
on
the
_
Grand
Mogul
_
and
moved
her
kit
ashore
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
back
in
a
hour
.
The
bank
had
gone
to
smash
and
carried
her
*NL*
four
hundred
dollars
with
it
.
She
was
a
pauper
and
homeless
.
Also
*NL*
disabled
bodily
,
at
least
for
the
present
.
The
officers
were
full
of
*NL*
sympathy
for
her
in
her
trouble
,
and
made
up
a
little
purse
for
her
.
She
*NL*
resolved
to
go
to
her
birthplace
;
she
had
friends
there
among
the
Negros
,
*NL*
and
the
unfortunate
always
help
the
unfortunate
,
she
was
well
aware
of
*NL*
that
;
those
lowly
comrades
of
her
youth
would
not
let
her
starve
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
the
little
local
packet
at
Cairo
,
and
now
she
was
on
the
*NL*
homestretch
.
Time
had
worn
away
her
bitterness
against
her
son
,
and
she
*NL*
was
able
to
think
of
him
with
serenity
.
She
put
the
vile
side
of
him
out
*NL*
of
her
mind
,
and
dwelt
only
on
recollections
of
his
occasional
acts
of
*NL*
kindness
to
her
.
She
gilded
and
otherwise
decorated
these
,
and
made
them
*NL*
very
pleasant
to
contemplate
.
She
began
to
long
to
see
him
.
She
would
go
*NL*
and
fawn
upon
him
slavelike
--
for
this
would
have
to
be
her
attitude
,
of
*NL*
course
--
and
maybe
she
would
find
that
time
had
modified
him
,
and
that
he
*NL*
would
be
glad
to
see
his
long-forgotten
old
nurse
and
treat
her
gently
.
*NL*
That
would
be
lovely
;
that
would
make
her
forget
her
woes
and
her
*NL*
poverty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
poverty
!
That
thought
inspired
her
to
add
another
castle
to
her
*NL*
dream
:
maybe
he
would
give
her
a
trifle
now
and
then
--
maybe
a
dollar
,
*NL*
once
a
month
,
say
;
any
little
thing
like
that
would
help
,
oh
,
ever
so
*NL*
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
she
reached
Dawson
's
Landing
,
she
was
her
old
self
again
;
her
*NL*
blues
were
gone
,
she
was
in
high
feather
.
She
would
get
along
,
surely
;
*NL*
there
were
many
kitchens
where
the
servants
would
share
their
meals
with
*NL*
her
,
and
also
steal
sugar
and
apples
and
other
dainties
for
her
to
carry
*NL*
home
--
or
give
her
a
chance
to
pilfer
them
herself
,
which
would
answer
*NL*
just
as
well
.
And
there
was
the
church
.
She
was
a
more
rabid
and
devoted
*NL*
Methodist
than
ever
,
and
her
piety
was
no
sham
,
but
was
strong
and
*NL*
sincere
.
Yes
,
with
plenty
of
creature
comforts
and
her
old
place
in
the
*NL*
amen
corner
in
her
possession
again
,
she
would
be
perfectly
happy
and
at
*NL*
peace
thenceforward
to
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
to
Judge
Driscoll
's
kitchen
first
of
all
.
She
was
received
*NL*
there
in
great
form
and
with
vast
enthusiasm
.
Her
wonderful
travels
,
and
*NL*
the
strange
countries
she
had
seen
,
and
the
adventures
she
had
had
,
made
*NL*
her
a
marvel
and
a
heroine
of
romance
.
The
Negros
hung
enchanted
upon
a
*NL*
great
story
of
her
experiences
,
interrupting
her
all
along
with
eager
*NL*
questions
,
with
laughter
,
exclamations
of
delight
,
and
expressions
of
*NL*
applause
;
and
she
was
obliged
to
confess
to
herself
that
if
there
was
*NL*
anything
better
in
this
world
than
steamboating
,
it
was
the
glory
to
be
*NL*
got
by
telling
about
it
.
The
audience
loaded
her
stomach
with
their
*NL*
dinners
,
and
then
stole
the
pantry
bare
to
load
up
her
basket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
in
St.
Louis
.
The
servants
said
he
had
spent
the
best
part
of
*NL*
his
time
there
during
the
previous
two
years
.
Roxy
came
every
day
,
and
*NL*
had
many
talks
about
the
family
and
its
affairs
.
Once
she
asked
why
Tom
*NL*
was
away
so
much
.
The
ostensible
``
Chambers
''
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

up

Tom
was
stretched
at
his
lazy
ease
on

brought

petition

Time
had
not
modified
his
ancient
detestation
of
the
humble
*NL*
drudge
and
protector
of
his
boyhood
;
it
was
still
bitter
and
*NL*
uncompromising
.
He
sat
up
and
bent
a
severe
gaze
upon
the
face
of
the
*NL*
young
fellow
whose
name
he
was
unconsciously
using
and
whose
family
*NL*
rights
he
was
enjoying
.
He
maintained
the
gaze
until
the
victim
of
it
*NL*
had
become
satisfactorily
pallid
with
terror
,
then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
the
old
rip
want
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
petition
was
meekly
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
gave
you
permission
to
come
and
disturb
me
with
the
social
*NL*
attentions
of
niggers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
risen
.
The
other
young
man
was
trembling
now
,
visibly
.
He
saw
*NL*
what
was
coming
,
and
bent
his
head
sideways
,
and
put
up
his
left
arm
to
*NL*
shield
it
.
Tom
rained
cuffs
upon
the
head
and
its
shield
,
saying
no
*NL*
word
:
the
victim
received
each
blow
with
a
beseeching
,
``
Please
,
Marse
*NL*
Tom
!
--
oh
,
please
,
Marse
Tom
!
''
Seven
blows
--
then
Tom
said
,
``
Face
the
*NL*
door
--
march
!
''
He
followed
behind
with
one
,
two
,
three
solid
kicks
.
The
*NL*
last
one
helped
the
pure-white
slave
over
the
door-sill
,
and
he
limped
*NL*
away
mopping
his
eyes
with
his
old
,
ragged
sleeve
.
Tom
shouted
after
*NL*
him
,
``
Send
her
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
flung
himself
panting
on
the
sofa
again
,
and
rasped
out
the
*NL*
remark
,
``
He
arrived
just
at
the
right
moment
;
I
was
full
to
the
brim
with
*NL*
bitter
thinkings
,
and
nobody
to
take
it
out
of
.
How
refreshing
it
was
!
*NL*
I
feel
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
mother
entered
now
,
closing
the
door
behind
her
,
and
approached
her
*NL*
son
with
all
the
wheedling
and
supplication
servilities
that
fear
and
*NL*
interest
can
impart
to
the
words
and
attitudes
of
the
born
slave
.
She
*NL*
stopped
a
yard
from
her
boy
and
made
two
or
three
admiring
exclamations
*NL*
over
his
manly
stature
and
general
handsomeness
,
and
Tom
put
an
arm
under
*NL*
his
head
and
hoisted
a
leg
over
the
sofa
back
in
order
to
look
properly
*NL*
indifferent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

What
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
bitter
disappointment
.
Roxy
had
for
so
many
days
nourished
*NL*
and
fondled
and
petted
her
notion
that
Tom
would
be
glad
to
see
his
old
*NL*
nurse
,
and
would
make
her
proud
and
happy
to
the
marrow
with
a
cordial
*NL*
word
or
two
,
that
it
took
two
rebuffs
to
convince
her
that
he
was
not
*NL*
funning
,
and
that
her
beautiful
dream
was
a
fond
and
foolish
variety
,
a
*NL*
shabby
and
pitiful
mistake
.
She
was
hurt
to
the
heart
,
and
so
ashamed
*NL*
that
for
a
moment
she
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
or
how
to
act
.
Then
*NL*
her
breast
began
to
heave
,
the
tears
came
,
and
in
her
forlornness
she
was
*NL*
moved
to
try
that
other
dream
of
hers
--
an
appeal
to
her
boy
's
charity
;
*NL*
and
so
,
upon
the
impulse
,
and
without
reflection
,
she
offered
her
*NL*
supplication
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marse
Tom
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
on
his
feet
so
suddenly
that
the
supplicant
was
startled
into
a
*NL*
jump
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

''
*NL*
*NL*
Roxy
backed
slowly
toward
the
door
.
When
she
was
halfway
she
stopped
,
*NL*
and
said
mournfully
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

Tom

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
relished
this
tune
less
than
any
that
he
had
preceded
it
,
for
it
*NL*
began
to
wake
up
a
sort
of
echo
in
his
conscience
;
so
he
interrupted
and
*NL*
said
with
decision
,
though
without
asperity
,
that
he
was
not
in
a
*NL*
situation
to
help
her
,
and
was
n't
going
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
you
ever
gwine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
Now
go
away
and
do
n't
bother
me
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Roxy
's
head
was
down
,
in
an
attitude
of
humility
.
But
now
the
fires
of
*NL*
her
old
wrongs
flamed
up
in
her
breast
and
began
to
burn
fiercely
.
She
*NL*
raised
her
head
slowly
,
till
it
was
well
up
,
and
at
the
same
time
her
*NL*
great
frame
unconsciously
assumed
an
erect
and
masterful
attitude
,
with
*NL*
all
the
majesty
and
grace
of
her
vanished
youth
in
it
.
She
raised
her
*NL*
finger
and
punctuated
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
has
said
de
word

You

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
cold
chill
went
to
Tom
's
heart
,
he
did
n't
know
why
;
for
he
did
not
*NL*
reflect
that
such
words
,
from
such
an
incongruous
source
,
and
so
solemnly
*NL*
delivered
,
could
not
easily
fail
of
that
effect
.
However
,
he
did
the
*NL*
natural
thing
:
he
replied
with
bluster
and
mockery
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
'll
_
give
me
a
chance

_
you

!
Perhaps
I
'd
better
get
down

*NL*
knees
now
!
But
in

I
do
n't
--
just
for
argument
's
sake
--
what
's
going
*NL*
to
happen
,
pray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

what

tell

`

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
cheek
blenched
,
and
she
saw
it
.
Disturbing
thoughts
began
to
chase
*NL*
each
other
through
his
head
.
``
How
can
she
know
?
And
yet
she
must
have
*NL*
found
out
--
she
looks
it
.
I
've
had
the
will
back
only
three
months
,
and
*NL*
am
already
deep
in
debt
again
,
and
moving
heaven
and
earth
to
save
myself
*NL*
from
exposure
and
destruction
,
with
a
reasonably
fair
show
of
getting
the
*NL*
thing
covered
up
if
I
'm
let
alone
,
and
now
this
fiend
has
gone
and
found
*NL*
me
out
somehow
or
other
.
I
wonder
how
much
she
knows
?
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
,
it
's
*NL*
enough
to
break
a
body
's
heart
!
But
I
've
got
to
humor
her
--
there
's
no
*NL*
other
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
worked
up
a
rather
sickly
sample
of
a
gay
laugh
and
a
hollow
*NL*
chipperness
of
manner
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
Roxy
dear
,
old
friends
like
you
and
me
must
n't
quarrel

*NL*
Here
's
your
dollar
--
now
tell
me
what
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
out
the
wildcat
bill
;
she
stood
as
she
was
,
and
made
no
movement
.
*NL*
It
was
her
turn
to
scorn
persuasive
foolery
now
,
and
she
did
not
waste
*NL*
it
.
She
said
,
with
a
grim
implacability
in
voice
and
manner
which
made
*NL*
Tom
almost
realize
that
even
a
former
slave
can
remember
for
ten
minutes
*NL*
insults
and
injuries
returned
for
compliments
and
flatteries
received
,
*NL*
and
can
also
enjoy
taking
revenge
for
them
when
the
opportunity
offers
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
I
know
?
I
'll
tell

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
aghast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
?
''
he
said
,
``
What
do
you
call
more
?
Where
's
there
any
room
for
*NL*
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Roxy
laughed
a
mocking
laugh
,
and
said
scoffingly
,
with
a
toss
of
her
*NL*
head
,
and
her
hands
on
her
hips
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
She
swung
herself
around
disdainfully
,
and
started
away
.
Tom
was
in
a
*NL*
panic
.
He
seized
her
skirts
,
and
implored
her
to
wait
.
She
turned
and
*NL*
said
,
loftily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look-a-heah

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
stupefied
for
a
moment
.
He
was
panting
with
excitement
.
Then
he
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
Tom
slumped
to
his
knees
and
began
to
beg
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
heir
of
two
centuries
of
unatoned
insult
and
outrage
looked
down
on
*NL*
him
and
seemed
to
drink
in
deep
draughts
of
satisfaction

Then
she
said

He
ran
to
his
room
overhead
and
brought
down
a
bottle
which
was
*NL*
two-thirds
full
.
She
tilted
it
up
and
took
a
drink
.
Her
eyes
sparkled
*NL*
with
satisfaction
,
and
she
tucked
the
bottle
under
her
shawl
,
saying
,
*NL*
``
It
's

I
'll
take
it
along

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
humbly
held
the
door
for
her
,
and
she
marched
out
as
grim
and
erect
*NL*
as
a
grenadier

_
Why
is
it
that
we
rejoice
at
a
birth
and
grieve
at
a
*NL*
funeral
?
It
is
because
we
are
not
the
person
involved
.

It
is
easy
to
find
fault
,
if
one
has
that
disposition
.
*NL*
There
was
once
a
man
who
,
not
being
able
to
find
any
other
*NL*
fault
with
his
coal
,
complained
that
there
were
too
many
*NL*
prehistoric
toads
in
it
.

Tom
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
,
and
put
his
throbbing
head
in
his
hands
,
*NL*
and
rested
his
elbows
on
his
knees
.
He
rocked
himself
back
and
forth
and
*NL*
moaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
knelt
to
a
nigger
wench
!
''
he
muttered
.
``
I
thought
I
had
struck
the
*NL*
deepest
depths
of
degradation
before
,
but
oh
,
dear
,
it
was
nothing
to
*NL*
this
...
Well
,
there
is
one
consolation
,
such
as
it
is
--
I
've
struck
*NL*
bottom
this
time
;
there
's
nothing
lower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
was
a
hasty
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
that
night
he
climbed
the
ladder
in
the
haunted
house
,
pale
,
weak
,
*NL*
and
wretched
.
Roxy
was
standing
in
the
door
of
one
of
the
rooms
,
*NL*
waiting
,
for
she
had
heard
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
two-story
log
house
which
had
acquired
the
reputation
a
few
*NL*
years
ago
of
being
haunted
,
and
that
was
the
end
of
its
usefulness
.
*NL*
Nobody
would
live
in
it
afterward
,
or
go
near
it
by
night
,
and
most
*NL*
people
even
gave
it
a
wide
berth
in
the
daytime
.
As
it
had
no
*NL*
competition
,
it
was
called
_
the
_
haunted
house
.
It
was
getting
crazy
and
*NL*
ruinous
now
,
from
long
neglect
.
It
stood
three
hundred
yards
beyond
*NL*
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
's
house
,
with
nothing
between
but
vacancy
.
It
was
the
*NL*
last
house
in
the
town
at
that
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
followed
Roxy
into
the
room
.
She
had
a
pile
of
clean
straw
in
the
*NL*
corner
for
a
bed
,
some
cheap
but
well-kept
clothing
was
hanging
on
the
*NL*
wall
,
there
was
a
tin
lantern
freckling
the
floor
with
little
spots
of
*NL*
light
,
and
there
were
various
soap
and
candle
boxes
scattered
about
,
*NL*
which
served
for
chairs
.
The
two
sat
down
.
Roxy
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

,
I
'll
tell
you
straight
off

I
'll

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
Tom
stared
at
her
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Roxy
,
what
do

*NL*
*NL*
She
rose

gloomed
above
him

*NL*

Tom
sprang
up
and
seized
a
billet
of
wood
and
raised
it
,
but
his
mother
*NL*
only
laughed
at
him

said
:

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
fretted
and
chafed
awhile
in
a
whirlwind
of
disorganizing
sensations
*NL*
and
emotions
,
and
finally
said
,
with
something
like
settled
conviction
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

''
*NL*
*NL*
Roxy
made
no
answer
.
She
took
the
lantern
and
started
for
the
door
.
Tom
*NL*
was
in
a
cold
panic
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
back
,
come
back

he
wailed
.
``
I
did

*NL*

The
woman
stood
a
moment
,
then
she
said
gravely
:

*NL*
``

more
than

*NL*
*NL*
Roxy
knew
her
conquest
was
complete
.
She
could
have
proved
nothing
to
*NL*
anybody
,
and
her
threat
of
writings
was
a
lie
;
but
she
knew
the
person
*NL*
she
was
dealing
with
,
and
had
made
both
statements
without
any
doubt
as
*NL*
to
the
effect
they
would
produce
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
and
sat
down
on
her
candle
box
,
and
the
pride
and
pomp
of
her
*NL*
victorious
attitude
made
it
a
throne
.
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
had
only
six
dollars
in
the
world
.
He
gave
her
that
,
and
*NL*
promised
to
start
fair
on
next
month
's
pension
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chambers

how
much
is

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
shuddered

and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
three
hundred

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is

gwine

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
groaned
out
:
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
;
do
n't
ask
me
such
awful
questions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
stuck
to
her
point
until
she
wearied
a
confession
out
of
him
:
he
*NL*
had
been
prowling
about
in
disguise
,
stealing
small
valuables
from
*NL*
private
houses
;
in
fact
,
he
made
a
good
deal
of
a
raid
on
his
fellow
*NL*
villagers
a
fortnight
before
,
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
in
St.
Louis
;
*NL*
but
he
doubted
if
he
had
sent
away
enough
stuff
to
realize
the
required
*NL*
amount
,
and
was
afraid
to
make
a
further
venture
in
the
present
excited
*NL*
state
of
the
town
.
His
mother
approved
of
his
conduct
,
and
offered
to
*NL*
help
,
but
this
frightened
him
.
He
tremblingly
ventured
to
say
that
if
*NL*
she
would
retire
from
the
town
he
should
feel
better
and
safer
,
and
could
*NL*
hold
his
head
higher
--
and
was
going
on
to
make
an
argument
,
but
she
*NL*
interrupted
and
surprised
him
pleasantly
by
saying
she
was
ready
;
it
*NL*
did
n't
make
any
difference
to
her
where
she
stayed
,
so
that
she
got
her
*NL*
share
of
the
pension
regularly
.
She
said
she
would
not
go
far
,
and
would
*NL*
call
at
the
haunted
house
once
a
month
for
her
money
.
Then
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
hate
you
so
much
now
,
but
I
've
hated
you
a
many
a

*NL*
anybody

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fell
to
sobbing
,
and
broke
down
.
Tom
said
:
``
But
you
know
I
did
n't
*NL*
know

were
my
mother

and
besides
--

*NL*
*NL*
``

Then

she
added
fiercely

*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
parting
,
Tom
said
,
in
the
most
persuasive
way
he
could
*NL*
command
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
,
would
you
mind
telling
me
who
was
my
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
supposed
he
was
asking
an
embarrassing
question
.
He
was
mistaken
.
*NL*
Roxy
drew
herself
up
with
a
proud
toss
of
her
head
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

She
put
*NL*
on
a
little
prouder
air
,
if
possible
,
and
added
impressively
:

Under

the

All

``
How

Calendar
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Every
now
and
then
,
after
Tom
went
to
bed
,
he
had
sudden
wakings
out
of
*NL*
his
sleep
,
and
his
first
thought
was
,
``
Oh
,
joy
,
it
was
all
a
dream
!
''
*NL*
Then
he
laid
himself
heavily
down
again
,
with
a
groan
and
the
muttered
*NL*
words
,
``
A
nigger
!
I
am
a
nigger
!
Oh
,
I
wish
I
was
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
woke
at
dawn
with
one
more
repetition
of
this
horror
,
and
then
he
*NL*
resolved
to
meddle
no
more
with
that
treacherous
sleep
.
He
began
to
*NL*
think
.
Sufficiently
bitter
thinkings
they
were
.
They
wandered
along
*NL*
something
after
this
fashion
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
were
niggers
_
and
_
whites
made
?
What
crime
did
the
uncreated
first
*NL*
nigger
commit
that
the
curse
of
birth
was
decreed
for
him
?
And
why
is
*NL*
this
awful
difference
made
between
white
and
black
?
...
How
hard
the
*NL*
nigger
's
fate
seems
,
this
morning
!
--
yet
until
last
night
such
a
thought
*NL*
never
entered
my
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
and
groaned
an
hour
or
more
away
.
Then
``
Chambers
''
came
humbly
*NL*
in
to
say
that
breakfast
was
nearly
ready
.
``
Tom
''
blushed
scarlet
to
see
*NL*
this
aristocratic
white
youth
cringe
to
him
,
a
nigger
,
and
call
him
*NL*
``
Young
Marster
.
''
He
said
roughly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
out
of
my
sight
!
''
and
when
the
youth
was
gone
,
he
muttered
,
``
He
has
*NL*
done
me
no
harm
,
poor
wretch
,
but
he
is
an
eyesore
to
me
now
,
for
he
is
*NL*
Driscoll
,
the
young
gentleman
,
and
I
am
a
--
oh
,
I
wish
I
was
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
gigantic
eruption
,
like
that
of
Krakatoa
a
few
years
ago
,
with
the
*NL*
accompanying
earthquakes
,
tidal
waves
,
and
clouds
of
volcanic
dust
,
*NL*
changes
the
face
of
the
surrounding
landscape
beyond
recognition
,
*NL*
bringing
down
the
high
lands
,
elevating
the
low
,
making
fair
lakes
where
*NL*
deserts
had
been
,
and
deserts
where
green
prairies
had
smiled
before
.
*NL*
The
tremendous
catastrophe
which
had
befallen
Tom
had
changed
his
moral
*NL*
landscape
in
much
the
same
way
.
Some
of
his
low
places
he
found
lifted
to
*NL*
ideals
,
some
of
his
ideas
had
sunk
to
the
valleys
,
and
lay
there
with
the
*NL*
sackcloth
and
ashes
of
pumice
stone
and
sulphur
on
their
ruined
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
days
he
wandered
in
lonely
places
,
thinking
,
thinking
,
thinking
*NL*
--
trying
to
get
his
bearings
.
It
was
new
work
.
If
he
met
a
friend
,
he
*NL*
found
that
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
had
in
some
mysterious
way
vanished
*NL*
--
his
arm
hung
limp
,
instead
of
involuntarily
extending
the
hand
for
a
*NL*
shake
.
It
was
the
``
nigger
''
in
him
asserting
its
humility
,
and
he
blushed
*NL*
and
was
abashed
.
And
the
``
nigger
''
in
him
was
surprised
when
the
white
*NL*
friend
put
out
his
hand
for
a
shake
with
him
.
He
found
the
``
nigger
''
in
*NL*
him
involuntarily
giving
the
road
,
on
the
sidewalk
,
to
a
white
rowdy
and
*NL*
loafer
.
When
Rowena
,
the
dearest
thing
his
heart
knew
,
the
idol
of
his
*NL*
secret
worship
,
invited
him
in
,
the
``
nigger
''
in
him
made
an
embarrassed
*NL*
excuse
and
was
afraid
to
enter
and
sit
with
the
dread
white
folks
on
*NL*
equal
terms
.
The
``
nigger
''
in
him
went
shrinking
and
skulking
here
and
*NL*
there
and
yonder
,
and
fancying
it
saw
suspicion
and
maybe
detection
in
*NL*
all
faces
,
tones
,
and
gestures
.
So
strange
and
uncharacteristic
was
*NL*
Tom
's
conduct
that
people
noticed
it
,
and
turned
to
look
after
him
when
*NL*
he
passed
on
;
and
when
he
glanced
back
--
as
he
could
not
help
doing
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
best
resistance
--
and
caught
that
puzzled
expression
in
a
*NL*
person
's
face
,
it
gave
him
a
sick
feeling
,
and
he
took
himself
out
of
*NL*
view
as
quickly
as
he
could
.
He
presently
came
to
have
a
hunted
sense
*NL*
and
a
hunted
look
,
and
then
he
fled
away
to
the
hilltops
and
the
*NL*
solitudes
.
He
said
to
himself
that
the
curse
of
Ham
was
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dreaded
his
meals
;
the
``
nigger
''
in
him
was
ashamed
to
sit
at
the
white
*NL*
folk
's
table
,
and
feared
discovery
all
the
time
;
and
once
when
Judge
*NL*
Driscoll
said
,
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
You
look
as
meek
as
a
*NL*
nigger
,
''
he
felt
as
secret
murderers
are
said
to
feel
when
the
accuser
*NL*
says
,
``
Thou
art
the
man
!
''
Tom
said
he
was
not
well
,
and
left
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
ostensible
``
aunt
's
''
solicitudes
and
endearments
were
become
a
terror
*NL*
to
him
,
and
he
avoided
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
the
time
,
hatred
of
his
ostensible
``
uncle
''
was
steadily
growing
*NL*
in
his
heart
;
for
he
said
to
himself
,
``
He
is
white
;
and
I
am
his
chattel
,
*NL*
his
property
,
his
goods
,
and
he
can
sell
me
,
just
as
he
could
his
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
as
much
as
a
week
after
this
,
Tom
imagined
that
his
character
had
*NL*
undergone
a
pretty
radical
change
.
But
that
was
because
he
did
not
know
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
several
ways
his
opinions
were
totally
changed
,
and
would
never
go
*NL*
back
to
what
they
were
before
,
but
the
main
structure
of
his
character
*NL*
was
not
changed
,
and
could
not
be
changed
.
One
or
two
very
important
*NL*
features
of
it
were
altered
,
and
in
time
effects
would
result
from
this
,
*NL*
if
opportunity
offered
--
effects
of
a
quite
serious
nature
,
too
.
Under
the
*NL*
influence
of
a
great
mental
and
moral
upheaval
,
his
character
and
his
*NL*
habits
had
taken
on
the
appearance
of
complete
change
,
but
after
a
while
*NL*
with
the
subsidence
of
the
storm
,
both
began
to
settle
toward
their
*NL*
former
places
.
He
dropped
gradually
back
into
his
old
frivolous
and
*NL*
easygoing
ways
and
conditions
of
feeling
and
manner
of
speech
,
and
no
*NL*
familiar
of
his
could
have
detected
anything
in
him
that
differentiated
*NL*
him
from
the
weak
and
careless
Tom
of
other
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
theft
raid
which
he
had
made
upon
the
village
turned
out
better
than
*NL*
he
had
ventured
to
hope
.
It
produced
the
sum
necessary
to
pay
his
gaming
*NL*
debts
,
and
saved
him
from
exposure
to
his
uncle
and
another
smashing
of
*NL*
the
will
.
He
and
his
mother
learned
to
like
each
other
fairly
well
.
She
*NL*
could
n't
love
him
,
as
yet
,
because
there
``
war
n't
nothing
_
to
_
him
,
''
as
*NL*
she
expressed
it
,
but
her
nature
needed
something
or
somebody
to
rule
*NL*
over
,
and
he
was
better
than
nothing
.
Her
strong
character
and
*NL*
aggressive
and
commanding
ways
compelled
Tom
's
admiration
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
fact
that
he
got
more
illustrations
of
them
than
he
needed
for
his
*NL*
comfort
.
However
,
as
a
rule
her
conversation
was
made
up
of
racy
tales
*NL*
about
the
privacies
of
the
chief
families
of
the
town
-LRB-
for
she
went
*NL*
harvesting
among
their
kitchens
every
time
she
came
to
the
village
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
Tom
enjoyed
this
.
It
was
just
in
his
line
.
She
always
collected
her
*NL*
half
of
his
pension
punctually
,
and
he
was
always
at
the
haunted
house
to
*NL*
have
a
chat
with
her
on
these
occasions
.
Every
now
and
then
,
she
paid
*NL*
him
a
visit
there
on
between-days
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasions
he
would
run
up
to
St.
Louis
for
a
few
weeks
,
and
at
last
*NL*
temptation
caught
him
again
.
He
won
a
lot
of
money
,
but
lost
it
,
and
*NL*
with
it
a
deal
more
besides
,
which
he
promised
to
raise
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
purpose
he
projected
a
new
raid
on
his
town
.
He
never
meddled
*NL*
with
any
other
town
,
for
he
was
afraid
to
venture
into
houses
whose
ins
*NL*
and
outs
he
did
not
know
and
the
habits
of
whose
households
he
was
not
*NL*
acquainted
with
.
He
arrived
at
the
haunted
house
in
disguise
on
the
*NL*
Wednesday
before
the
advent
of
the
twins
--
after
writing
his
Aunt
Pratt
*NL*
that
he
would
not
arrive
until
two
days
after
--
and
laying
in
hiding
there
*NL*
with
his
mother
until
toward
daylight
Friday
morning
,
when
he
went
to
his
*NL*
uncle
's
house
and
entered
by
the
back
way
with
his
own
key
,
and
slipped
*NL*
up
to
his
room
where
he
could
have
the
use
of
the
mirror
and
toilet
*NL*
articles
.
He
had
a
suit
of
girl
's
clothes
with
him
in
a
bundle
as
a
*NL*
disguise
for
his
raid
,
and
was
wearing
a
suit
of
his
mother
's
clothing
,
*NL*
with
black
gloves
and
veil
.
By
dawn
he
was
tricked
out
for
his
raid
,
but
*NL*
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
through
the
window
over
the
way
,
*NL*
and
knew
that
Pudd
`
nhead
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
.
So
he
entertained
*NL*
Wilson
with
some
airs
and
graces
and
attitudes
for
a
while
,
then
stepped
*NL*
out
of
sight
and
resumed
the
other
disguise
,
and
by
and
by
went
down
and
*NL*
out
the
back
way
and
started
downtown
to
reconnoiter
the
scene
of
his
*NL*
intended
labors
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
ill
at
ease
.
He
had
changed
back
to
Roxy
's
dress
,
with
the
*NL*
stoop
of
age
added
to
the
disguise
,
so
that
Wilson
would
not
bother
*NL*
himself
about
a
humble
old
women
leaving
a
neighbor
's
house
by
the
back
*NL*
way
in
the
early
morning
,
in
case
he
was
still
spying
.
But
supposing
*NL*
Wilson
had
seen
him
leave
,
and
had
thought
it
suspicious
,
and
had
also
*NL*
followed
him
?
The
thought
made
Tom
cold
.
He
gave
up
the
raid
for
the
*NL*
day
,
and
hurried
back
to
the
haunted
house
by
the
obscurest
route
he
*NL*
knew
.
His
mother
was
gone
;
but
she
came
back
,
by
and
by
,
with
the
news
of
*NL*
the
grand
reception
at
Patsy
Cooper
's
,
and
soon
persuaded
him
that
the
*NL*
opportunity
was
like
a
special
Providence
,
it
was
so
inviting
and
*NL*
perfect
.
So
he
went
raiding
,
after
all
,
and
made
a
nice
success
of
it
*NL*
while
everybody
was
gone
to
Patsy
Cooper
's
.
Success
gave
him
nerve
and
*NL*
even
actual
intrepidity
;
insomuch
,
indeed
,
that
after
he
had
conveyed
his
*NL*
harvest
to
his
mother
in
a
back
alley
,
he
went
to
the
reception
himself
,
*NL*
and
added
several
of
the
valuables
of
that
house
to
his
takings
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
long
digression
we
have
now
arrived
once
more
at
the
point
*NL*
where
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
,
while
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
twins
on
*NL*
that
same
Friday
evening
,
sat
puzzling
over
the
strange
apparition
of
*NL*
that
morning
--
a
girl
in
young
Tom
Driscoll
's
bedroom
;
fretting
,
and
*NL*
guessing
,
and
puzzling
over
it
,
and
wondering
who
the
shameless
creature
*NL*
might
be
.

_
There
are
three
infallible
ways
of
pleasing
an
author
,
and
*NL*
the
three
form
a
rising
scale
of
compliment
:
1
--
to
tell
him
*NL*
you
have
read
one
of
his
books
;
2
--
to
tell
him
you
have
read
*NL*
all
of
his
books
;
3
--
to
ask
him
to
let
you
read
the
*NL*
manuscript
of
his
forthcoming
book
.
No.
1
admits
you
to
his
*NL*
respect
;
No.
2
admits
you
to
his
admiration
;
No.
3
carries
*NL*
you
clear
into
his
heart

Pudd

Calendar

*NL*
*NL*
The
twins
arrived
presently
,
and
talk
began
.
It
flowed
along
chattily
*NL*
and
sociably
,
and
under
its
influence
the
new
friendship
gathered
ease
*NL*
and
strength
.
Wilson
got
out
his
Calendar
,
by
request
,
and
read
a
*NL*
passage
or
two
from
it
,
which
the
twins
praised
quite
cordially
.
This
*NL*
pleased
the
author
so
much
that
he
complied
gladly
when
they
asked
him
to
*NL*
lend
them
a
batch
of
the
work
to
read
at
home
.
In
the
course
of
their
*NL*
wide
travels
,
they
had
found
out
that
there
are
three
sure
ways
of
*NL*
pleasing
an
author
;
they
were
now
working
the
best
of
the
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
interruption
now
.
Young
Driscoll
appeared
,
and
joined
the
*NL*
party
.
He
pretended
to
be
seeing
the
distinguished
strangers
for
the
*NL*
first
time
when
they
rose
to
shake
hands
;
but
this
was
only
a
blind
,
as
*NL*
he
had
already
had
a
glimpse
of
them
,
at
the
reception
,
while
robbing
the
*NL*
house
.
The
twins
made
mental
note
that
he
was
smooth-faced
and
rather
*NL*
handsome
,
and
smooth
and
undulatory
in
his
movements
--
graceful
,
in
fact
.
*NL*
Angelo
thought
he
had
a
good
eye
;
Luigi
thought
there
was
something
*NL*
veiled
and
sly
about
it
.
Angelo
thought
he
had
a
pleasant
free-and-easy
*NL*
way
of
talking
;
Luigi
thought
it
was
more
so
than
was
agreeable
.
Angelo
*NL*
thought
he
was
a
sufficiently
nice
young
man
;
Luigi
reserved
his
*NL*
decision
.
Tom
's
first
contribution
to
the
conversation
was
a
question
*NL*
which
he
had
put
to
Wilson
a
hundred
times
before
.
It
was
always
cheerily
*NL*
and
good-natured
put
,
and
always
inflicted
a
little
pang
,
for
it
touched
*NL*
a
secret
sore
;
but
this
time
the
pang
was
sharp
,
since
strangers
were
*NL*
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
does
the
law
come
on
?
Had
a
case
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
bit
his
lip
,
but
answered
,
``
No
--
not
yet
,
''
with
as
much
*NL*
indifference
as
he
could
assume
.
Judge
Driscoll
had
generously
left
the
*NL*
law
feature
out
of
Wilson
's
biography
which
he
had
furnished
to
the
*NL*
twins
.
Young
Tom
laughed
pleasantly
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wilson
's
a
lawyer
,
gentlemen
,
but
he
does
n't
practice
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sarcasm
bit
,
but
Wilson
kept
himself
under
control
,
and
said
without
*NL*
passion
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
practice
,
it
is
true
.
It
is
true
that
I
have
never
had
a
case
,
*NL*
and
have
had
to
earn
a
poor
living
for
twenty
years
as
an
expert
*NL*
accountant
in
a
town
where
I
ca
n't
get
a
hold
of
a
set
of
books
to
*NL*
untangle
as
often
as
I
should
like
.
But
it
is
also
true
that
I
did
*NL*
myself
well
for
the
practice
of
the
law
.
By
the
time
I
was
your
age
,
*NL*
Tom
,
I
had
chosen
a
profession
,
and
was
soon
competent
to
enter
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
Tom
winced
.
``
I
never
got
a
chance
to
try
my
hand
at
it
,
and
I
may
never
*NL*
get
a
chance
;
and
yet
if
I
ever
do
get
it
,
I
shall
be
found
ready
,
for
I
*NL*
have
kept
up
my
law
studies
all
these
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
;
that
's
good
grit
!
I
like
to
see
it
.
I
've
a
notion
to
throw
*NL*
all
my
business
your
way
.
My
business
and
your
law
practice
ought
to
*NL*
make
a
pretty
gay
team
,
Dave
,
''
and
the
young
fellow
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
throw
--
''
Wilson
had
thought
of
the
girl
in
Tom
's
bedroom
,
*NL*
and
was
going
to
say
,
``
If
you
will
throw
the
surreptitious
and
*NL*
disreputable
part
of
your
business
my
way
,
it
may
amount
to
something
,
''
*NL*
but
thought
better
of
it
and
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
this
matter
does
n't
fit
well
in
a
general
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
we
'll
change
the
subject
;
I
guess
you
were
about
to
give
me
*NL*
another
dig
,
anyway
,
so
I
'm
willing
to
change
.
How
's
the
Awful
Mystery
*NL*
flourishing
these
days
?
Wilson
's
got
a
scheme
for
driving
plain
window
*NL*
glass
panes
out
of
the
market
by
decorating
it
with
greasy
finger
marks
,
*NL*
and
getting
rich
by
selling
it
at
famine
prices
to
the
crowned
heads
over
*NL*
in
Europe
to
outfit
their
palaces
with
.
Fetch
it
out
,
Dave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
brought
three
of
his
glass
strips
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
get
the
subject
to
pass
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
through
his
hair
,
*NL*
so
as
to
get
a
little
coating
of
the
natural
oil
on
them
,
and
then
press
*NL*
the
balls
of
them
on
the
glass
.
A
fine
and
delicate
print
of
the
lines
*NL*
in
the
skin
results
,
and
is
permanent
,
if
it
does
n't
come
in
contact
with
*NL*
something
able
to
rub
it
off
.
You
begin
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
think
you
took
my
finger
marks
once
or
twice
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
you
were
a
little
boy
the
last
time
,
only
about
twelve
years
*NL*
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
.
Of
course
,
I
've
changed
entirely
since
then
,
and
variety
is
*NL*
what
the
crowned
heads
want
,
I
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
his
fingers
through
his
crop
of
short
hair
,
and
pressed
them
*NL*
one
at
a
time
on
the
glass
.
Angelo
made
a
print
of
his
fingers
on
*NL*
another
glass
,
and
Luigi
followed
with
a
third
.
Wilson
marked
the
*NL*
glasses
with
names
and
dates
,
and
put
them
away
.
Tom
gave
one
of
his
*NL*
little
laughs
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
would
n't
say
anything
,
but
if
variety
is
what
you
are
after
,
*NL*
you
have
wasted
a
piece
of
glass
.
The
hand
print
of
one
twin
is
the
same
*NL*
as
the
hand
print
of
the
fellow
twin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
done
now
,
and
I
like
to
have
them
both
,
anyway
,
''
said
Wilson
,
*NL*
returned
to
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
look
here
,
Dave
,
''
said
Tom
,
``
you
used
to
tell
people
's
fortunes
,
too
,
*NL*
when
you
took
their
finger
marks
.
Dave
's
just
an
all-round
genius
--
a
*NL*
genius
of
the
first
water
,
gentlemen
;
a
great
scientist
running
to
seed
*NL*
here
in
this
village
,
a
prophet
with
the
kind
of
honor
that
prophets
*NL*
generally
get
at
home
--
for
here
they
do
n't
give
shucks
for
his
*NL*
scientifics
,
and
they
call
his
skull
a
notion
factory
--
hey
,
Dave
,
ai
n't
*NL*
it
so
?
But
never
mind
,
he
'll
make
his
mark
someday
--
finger
mark
,
you
*NL*
know
,
he-he
!
But
really
,
you
want
to
let
him
take
a
shy
at
your
palms
*NL*
once
;
it
's
worth
twice
the
price
of
admission
or
your
money
's
returned
at
*NL*
the
door
.
Why
,
he
'll
read
your
wrinkles
as
easy
as
a
book
,
and
not
only
*NL*
tell
you
fifty
or
sixty
things
that
's
going
to
happen
to
you
,
but
fifty
*NL*
or
sixty
thousand
that
ai
n't
.
Come
,
Dave
,
show
the
gentlemen
what
an
*NL*
inspired
jack-at-all-science
we
've
got
in
this
town
,
and
do
n't
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
winced
under
this
nagging
and
not
very
courteous
chaff
,
and
the
*NL*
twins
suffered
with
him
and
for
him
.
They
rightly
judged
,
now
,
that
the
*NL*
best
way
to
relieve
him
would
be
to
take
the
thing
in
earnest
and
*NL*
treat
it
with
respect
,
ignoring
Tom
's
rather
overdone
raillery
;
so
Luigi
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
seen
something
of
palmistry
in
our
wanderings
,
and
know
very
*NL*
well
what
astonishing
things
it
can
do
.
If
it
is
n't
a
science
,
and
one
*NL*
of
the
greatest
of
them
too
,
I
do
n't
know
what
its
other
name
ought
to
*NL*
be
.
In
the
Orient
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
looked
surprised
and
incredulous
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
juggling
a
science
?
But
really
,
you
ai
n't
serious
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
entirely
so
.
Four
years
ago
we
had
our
hands
read
out
to
us
as
if
*NL*
our
plans
had
been
covered
with
print
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
you
mean
to
say
there
was
actually
anything
in
it
?
''
asked
Tom
,
*NL*
his
incredulity
beginning
to
weaken
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
this
much
in
it
,
''
said
Angelo
:
``
what
was
told
us
of
our
*NL*
characters
was
minutely
exact
--
we
could
have
not
have
bettered
it
*NL*
ourselves
.
Next
,
two
or
three
memorable
things
that
have
happened
to
us
*NL*
were
laid
bare
--
things
which
no
one
present
but
ourselves
could
have
*NL*
known
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
rank
sorcery
!
''
exclaimed
Tom
,
who
was
now
becoming
very
much
*NL*
interested
.
``
And
how
did
they
make
out
with
what
was
going
to
happen
to
*NL*
you
in
the
future
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
whole
,
quite
fairly
,
''
said
Luigi
.
``
Two
or
three
of
the
most
*NL*
striking
things
foretold
have
happened
since
;
much
the
most
striking
one
*NL*
of
all
happened
within
that
same
year
.
Some
of
the
minor
prophesies
have
*NL*
come
true
;
some
of
the
minor
and
some
of
the
major
ones
have
not
been
*NL*
fulfilled
yet
,
and
of
course
may
never
be
:
still
,
I
should
be
more
*NL*
surprised
if
they
failed
to
arrive
than
if
they
did
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
entirely
sobered
,
and
profoundly
impressed
.
He
said
,
*NL*
apologetically
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dave
,
I
was
n't
meaning
to
belittle
that
science
;
I
was
only
chaffing
*NL*
--
chattering
,
I
reckon
I
'd
better
say
.
I
wish
you
would
look
at
their
*NL*
palms
.
Come
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
certainly
,
if
you
want
me
to
;
but
you
know
I
've
had
no
chance
to
*NL*
become
an
expert
,
and
do
n't
claim
to
be
one
.
When
a
past
event
is
*NL*
somewhat
prominently
recorded
in
the
palm
,
I
can
generally
detect
that
,
*NL*
but
minor
ones
often
escape
me
--
not
always
,
of
course
,
but
often
--
but
I
*NL*
have
n't
much
confidence
in
myself
when
it
comes
to
reading
the
future
.
I
*NL*
am
talking
as
if
palmistry
was
a
daily
study
with
me
,
but
that
is
not
so
.
*NL*
I
have
n't
examined
half
a
dozen
hands
in
the
last
half
dozen
years
;
you
*NL*
see
,
the
people
got
to
joking
about
it
,
and
I
stopped
to
let
the
talk
die
*NL*
down
.
I
'll
tell
you
what
we
'll
do
,
Count
Luigi
:
I
'll
make
a
try
at
your
*NL*
past
,
and
if
I
have
any
success
there
--
no
,
on
the
whole
,
I
'll
let
the
*NL*
future
alone
;
that
's
really
the
affair
of
an
expert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
Luigi
's
hand
.
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
--
do
n't
look
yet
,
Dave
!
Count
Luigi
,
here
's
paper

pencil

Set
*NL*
down
that
thing
that
you
said
was
the
most
striking
one
that
was
foretold
*NL*
to
you
,
and
happened
less
than
a
year
afterward
,
and
give
it
to
me
so
I
*NL*
can
see
if
Dave
finds
it
in
your
hand

''
*NL*
*NL*
Luigi
wrote
a
line
privately
,
and
folded
up
the
piece
of
paper
,
and
*NL*
handed
it
to
Tom
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
when
to
look
at
it
,
if
he
finds
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
began
to
study
Luigi
's
palm
,
tracing
life
lines
,
heart
lines
,
head
*NL*
lines
,
and
so
on
,
and
noting
carefully
their
relations
with
the
cobweb
of
*NL*
finer
and
more
delicate
marks
and
lines
that
enmeshed
them
on
all
sides
;
*NL*
he
felt
of
the
fleshy
cushion
at
the
base
of
the
thumb
and
noted
its
*NL*
shape
;
he
felt
of
the
fleshy
side
of
the
hand
between
the
wrist
and
the
*NL*
base
of
the
little
finger
and
noted
its
shape
also
;
he
painstakingly
*NL*
examined
the
fingers
,
observing
their
form
,
proportions
,
and
natural
*NL*
manner
of
disposing
themselves
when
in
repose
.
All
this
process
was
*NL*
watched
by
the
three
spectators
with
absorbing
interest
,
their
heads
bent
*NL*
together
over
Luigi
's
palm
,
and
nobody
disturbing
the
stillness
with
a
*NL*
word
.
Wilson
now
entered
upon
a
close
survey
of
the
palm
again
,
and
his
*NL*
revelations
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
mapped
out
Luigi
's
character
and
disposition
,
his
tastes
,
aversions
,
*NL*
proclivities
,
ambitions
,
and
eccentricities
in
a
way
which
sometimes
made
*NL*
Luigi
wince
and
the
others
laugh
,
but
both
twins
declared
that
the
chart
*NL*
was
artistically
drawn
and
was
correct
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
,
Wilson
took
up
Luigi
's
history
.
He
proceeded
cautiously
and
with
*NL*
hesitation
now
,
moving
his
finger
slowly
along
the
great
lines
of
the
*NL*
palm
,
and
now
and
then
halting
it
at
a
``
star
''
or
some
such
landmark
,
and
*NL*
examining
that
neighborhood
minutely
.
He
proclaimed
one
or
two
past
*NL*
events
,
Luigi
confirmed
his
correctness
,
and
the
search
went
on
.
*NL*
Presently
Wilson
glanced
up
suddenly
with
a
surprised
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
a
record
of
an
incident
which
you
would
perhaps
not
wish
me
*NL*
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
it
out
,
''
said
Luigi
,
good-naturedly
.
``
I
promise
you
sha
'n'
t
*NL*
embarrass
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Wilson
still
hesitated
,
and
did
not
seem
quite
to
know
what
to
do
.
*NL*
Then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
is
too
delicate
a
matter
to
--
to
--
I
believe
I
would
rather
*NL*
write
it
or
whisper
it
to
you
,
and
let
you
decide
for
yourself
whether
*NL*
you
want
it
talked
out
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
answer
,
''
said
Luigi
.
``
Write
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
wrote
something
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
Luigi
,
who
*NL*
read
it
to
himself
and
said
to
Tom
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unfold
your
slip
and
read
it
,
Mr.
Driscoll

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
IT
WAS
PROPHESIED
THAT

WOULD
KILL

IT

TRUE

THE

Tom
added
,
``
Great
Scott

*NL*
*NL*
Luigi
handed
Wilson
's
paper
to
Tom
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
read
this
one

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
read
:

*NL*
''
`
YOU
HAVE
KILLED
SOMEONE
,
BUT
WHETHER
MAN
,
WOMAN
,
OR
CHILD
,
I
DO
NOT
*NL*
MAKE
OUT
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caesar
's
ghost
!
''
commented
Tom
,
with
astonishment
.
``
It
beats
anything
*NL*
that
was
ever
heard
of
!
Why
,
a
man
's
own
hand
is
his
deadliest
enemy
!
*NL*
Just
think
of
that
--
a
man
's
own
hand
keeps
a
record
of
the
deepest
and
*NL*
fatalest
secrets
of
his
life
,
and
is
treacherously
ready
to
expose
*NL*
himself
to
any
black-magic
stranger
that
comes
along
.
But
what
do
you
*NL*
let
a
person
look
at
your
hand
for
,
with
that
awful
thing
printed
on
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Luigi
,
reposefully
,
``
I
do
n't
mind
it
.
I
killed
the
man
for
*NL*
good
reasons
,
and
I
do
n't
regret
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
the
reasons
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
needed
killing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
why
he
did
it
,
since
he
wo
n't
say
himself
,
''
said
Angelo
,
*NL*
warmly
.
``
He
did
it
to
save
my
life
,
that
's
what
he
did
it
for
.
So
it
was
*NL*
a
noble
act
,
and
not
a
thing
to
be
hid
in
the
dark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
was
,
so
it
was
,
''
said
Wilson
.
``
To
do
such
a
thing
to
save
a
*NL*
brother
's
life
is
a
great
and
fine
action
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
come
,
''
said
Luigi
,
``
it
is
very
pleasant
to
hear
you
say
these
*NL*
things
,
but
for
unselfishness
,
or
heroism
,
or
magnanimity
,
the
*NL*
circumstances
wo
n't
stand
scrutiny
.
You
overlook
one
detail
;
suppose
I
*NL*
had
n't
saved
Angelo
's
life
,
what
would
have
become
of
mine
?
If
I
had
let
*NL*
the
man
kill
him
,
would
n't
he
have
killed
me
,
too
?
I
saved
my
own
life
,
*NL*
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
your
way
of
talking
,
''
said
Angelo
,
``
but
I
know
you
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
you
thought
of
yourself
at
all
.
I
keep
that
weapon
yet
*NL*
that
Luigi
killed
the
man
with
,
and
I
'll
show
it
to
you
sometime
.
That
*NL*
incident
makes
it
interesting
,
and
it
had
a
history
before
it
came
into
*NL*
Luigi
's
hands
which
adds
to
its
interest
.
It
was
given
to
Luigi
by
a
*NL*
great
Indian
prince
,
the
Gaikowar
of
Baroda
,
and
it
had
been
in
his
*NL*
family
two
or
three
centuries
.
It
killed
a
good
many
disagreeable
people
*NL*
who
troubled
the
hearthstone
at
one
time
or
another
.
It
is
n't
much
too
*NL*
look
at
,
except
it
is
n't
shaped
like
other
knives
,
or
dirks
,
or
whatever
*NL*
it
may
be
called
--
here
,
I
'll
draw
it
for
you
.
''
He
took
a
sheet
of
paper
*NL*
and
made
a
rapid
sketch
.
``
There
it
is
--
a
broad
and
murderous
blade
,
with
*NL*
edges
like
a
razor
for
sharpness
.
The
devices
engraved
on
it
are
the
*NL*
ciphers
or
names
of
its
long
line
of
possessors
--
I
had
Luigi
's
name
added
*NL*
in
Roman
letters
myself
with
our
coat
of
arms
,
as
you
see
.
You
notice
*NL*
what
a
curious
handle
the
thing
has
.
It
is
solid
ivory
,
polished
like
a
*NL*
mirror
,
and
is
four
or
five
inches
long
--
round
,
and
as
thick
as
a
large
*NL*
man
's
wrist
,
with
the
end
squared
off
flat
,
for
your
thumb
to
rest
on
;
*NL*
for
you
grasp
it
,
with
your
thumb
resting
on
the
blunt
end
--
so
--
and
lift
*NL*
it
along
and
strike
downward
.
The
Gaikowar
showed
us
how
the
thing
was
*NL*
done
when
he
gave
it
to
Luigi
,
and
before
that
night
was
ended
,
Luigi
had
*NL*
used
the
knife
,
and
the
Gaikowar
was
a
man
short
by
reason
of
it
.
The
*NL*
sheath
is
magnificently
ornamented
with
gems
of
great
value
.
You
will
*NL*
find
a
sheath
more
worth
looking
at
than
the
knife
itself
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
said
to
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
lucky
I
came
here
.
I
would
have
sold
that
knife
for
a
song
;
I
*NL*
supposed
the
jewels
were
glass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
go
on
;
do
n't
stop
,
''
said
Wilson
.
``
Our
curiosity
is
up
now
,
to
hear
*NL*
about
the
homicide
.
Tell
us
about
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
briefly
,
the
knife
was
to
blame
for
that
,
all
around
.
A
native
*NL*
servant
slipped
into
our
room
in
the
palace
in
the
night
,
to
kill
us
and
*NL*
steal
the
knife
on
account
of
the
fortune
encrusted
on
its
sheath
,
*NL*
without
a
doubt
.
Luigi
had
it
under
his
pillow
;
we
were
in
bed
together
.
*NL*
There
was
a
dim
night-light
burning
.
I
was
asleep
,
but
Luigi
was
awake
,
*NL*
and
he
thought
he
detected
a
vague
form
nearing
the
bed
.
He
slipped
the
*NL*
knife
out
of
the
sheath
and
was
ready
and
unembarrassed
by
hampering
*NL*
bedclothes
,
for
the
weather
was
hot
and
we
had
n't
any
.
Suddenly
that
*NL*
native
rose
at
the
bedside
,
and
bent
over
me
with
his
right
hand
lifted
*NL*
and
a
dirk
in
it
aimed
at
my
throat
;
but
Luigi
grabbed
his
wrist
,
pulled
*NL*
him
downward
,
and
drove
his
own
knife
into
the
man
's
neck
.
That
is
the
*NL*
whole
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
and
Tom
drew
deep
breaths
,
and
after
some
general
chat
about
the
*NL*
tragedy
,
Pudd
`
nhead
said
,
taking
Tom
's
hand
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Tom
,
I
've
never
had
a
look
at
your
palms
,
as
it
happens
;
perhaps
*NL*
you
've
got
some
little
questionable
privacies
that
need
--
hel-lo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
snatched
away
his
hand
,
and
was
looking
a
good
deal
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
's
blushing
!
''
said
Luigi
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
darted
an
ugly
look
at
him
,
and
said
sharply
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
I
am
,
it
ai
n't
because
I
'm
a
murderer
!
''
Luigi
's
dark
face
*NL*
flushed
,
but
before
he
could
speak
or
move
,
Tom
added
with
anxious
haste
:
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
beg
a
thousand
pardons
.
I
did
n't
mean
that
;
it
was
out
before
I
*NL*
thought
,
and
I
'm
very
,
very
sorry
--
you
must
forgive
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
came
to
the
rescue
,
and
smoothed
things
down
as
well
as
he
could
;
*NL*
and
in
fact
was
entirely
successful
as
far
as
the
twins
were
concerned
,
*NL*
for
they
felt
sorrier
for
the
affront
put
upon
him
by
his
guest
's
*NL*
outburst
of
ill
manners
than
for
the
insult
offered
to
Luigi
.
But
the
*NL*
success
was
not
so
pronounced
with
the
offender
.
Tom
tried
to
seem
at
*NL*
his
ease
,
and
he
went
through
the
motions
fairly
well
,
but
at
bottom
he
*NL*
felt
resentful
toward
all
the
three
witnesses
of
his
exhibition
;
in
fact
,
*NL*
he
felt
so
annoyed
at
them
for
having
witnessed
it
and
noticed
it
that
he
*NL*
almost
forgot
to
feel
annoyed
at
himself
for
placing
it
before
them
.
*NL*
However
,
something
presently
happened
which
made
him
almost
comfortable
,
*NL*
and
brought
him
nearly
back
to
a
state
of
charity
and
friendliness
.
This
*NL*
was
a
little
spat
between
the
twins
;
not
much
of
a
spat
,
but
still
a
*NL*
spat
;
and
before
they
got
far
with
it
,
they
were
in
a
decided
condition
*NL*
of
irritation
while
pretending
to
be
actuated
by
more
respectable
*NL*
motives
.
By
his
help
the
fire
got
warmed
up
to
the
blazing
point
,
and
he
*NL*
might
have
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
flames
show
up
in
another
*NL*
moment
,
but
for
the
interruption
of
a
knock
on
the
door
--
an
interruption
*NL*
which
fretted
him
as
much
as
it
gratified
Wilson
.
Wilson
opened
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
was
a
good-natured
,
ignorant
,
energetic
middle-aged
Irishman
*NL*
named
John
Buckstone
,
who
was
a
great
politician
in
a
small
way
,
and
*NL*
always
took
a
large
share
in
public
matters
of
every
sort
.
One
of
the
*NL*
town
's
chief
excitements
,
just
now
,
was
over
the
matter
of
rum
.
There
*NL*
was
a
strong
rum
party
and
a
strong
anti-rum
party
.
Buckstone
was
*NL*
training
with
the
rum
party
,
and
he
had
been
sent
to
hunt
up
the
twins
*NL*
and
invite
them
to
attend
a
mass
meeting
of
that
faction
.
He
delivered
*NL*
his
errand
,
and
said
the
clans
were
already
gathering
in
the
big
hall
*NL*
over
the
market
house
.
Luigi
accepted
the
invitation
cordially
.
Angelo
*NL*
less
cordially
,
since
he
disliked
crowds
,
and
did
not
drink
the
powerful
*NL*
intoxicants
of
America
.
In
fact
,
he
was
even
a
teetotaler
sometimes
*NL*
--
when
it
was
judicious
to
be
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
twins
left
with
Buckstone
,
and
Tom
Driscoll
joined
the
company
with
*NL*
them
uninvited
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
distance
,
one
could
see
a
long
wavering
line
of
torches
drifting
*NL*
down
the
main
street
,
and
could
hear
the
throbbing
of
the
bass
drum
,
the
*NL*
clash
of
cymbals
,
the
squeaking
of
a
fife
or
two
,
and
the
faint
roar
of
*NL*
remote
hurrahs
.
The
tail
end
of
this
procession
was
climbing
the
market
*NL*
house
stairs
when
the
twins
arrived
in
its
neighborhood
;
when
they
*NL*
reached
the
hall
,
it
was
full
of
people
,
torches
,
smoke
,
noise
,
and
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
They
were
conducted
to
the
platform
by
Buckstone
--
Tom
*NL*
Driscoll
still
following
--
and
were
delivered
to
the
chairman
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
a
prodigious
explosion
of
welcome
.
When
the
noise
had
moderated
a
*NL*
little
,
the
chair
proposed
that
``
our
illustrious
guests
be
at
once
*NL*
elected
,
by
complimentary
acclamation
,
to
membership
in
our
ever-glorious
*NL*
organization
,
the
paradise
of
the
free
and
the
perdition
of
the
slave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
eloquent
discharge
opened
the
floodgates
of
enthusiasm
again
,
and
*NL*
the
election
was
carried
with
thundering
unanimity
.
Then
arose
a
storm
*NL*
of
cries
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wet
them
down
!
Wet
them
down
!
Give
them
a
drink
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Glasses
of
whisky
were
handed
to
the
twins
.
Luigi
waves
his
aloft
,
then
*NL*
brought
it
to
his
lips
;
but
Angelo
set
his
down
.
There
was
another
storm
*NL*
of
cries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
the
other
one
?
''
``
What
is
the
blond
one
going
*NL*
back
on
us
for
?
''
``
Explain
!
Explain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chairman
inquired
,
and
then
reported
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
made
an
unfortunate
mistake
,
gentlemen
.
I
find
that
the
Count
*NL*
Angelo
Capello
is
opposed
to
our
creed
--
is
a
teetotaler
,
in
fact
,
and
was
*NL*
not
intending
to
apply
for
membership
with
us
.
He
desires
that
we
*NL*
reconsider
the
vote
by
which
he
was
elected
.
What
is
the
pleasure
of
the
*NL*
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
burst
of
laughter
,
plentifully
accented
with
*NL*
whistlings
and
catcalls
,
but
the
energetic
use
of
the
gavel
presently
*NL*
restored
something
like
order
.
Then
a
man
spoke
from
the
crowd
,
and
said
*NL*
that
while
he
was
very
sorry
that
the
mistake
had
been
made
,
it
would
not
*NL*
be
possible
to
rectify
it
at
the
present
meeting
.
According
to
the
*NL*
bylaws
,
it
must
go
over
to
the
next
regular
meeting
for
action
.
He
would
*NL*
not
offer
a
motion
,
as
none
was
required
.
He
desired
to
apologize
to
the
*NL*
gentlemen
in
the
name
of
the
house
,
and
begged
to
assure
him
that
as
far
*NL*
as
it
might
lie
in
the
power
of
the
Sons
of
Liberty
,
his
temporary
*NL*
membership
in
the
order
would
be
made
pleasant
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
speech
was
received
with
great
applause
,
mixed
with
cries
of
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
talk
!
''
``
He
's
a
good
fellow
,
anyway
,
if
he
_
is
_
a
teetotaler
!
''
*NL*
``
Drink
his
health
!
''
``
Give
him
a
rouser
,
and
no
heeltaps
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Glasses
were
handed
around
,
and
everybody
on
the
platform
drank
Angelo
's
*NL*
health
,
while
the
house
bellowed
forth
in
song
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
he
's
a
jolly
good
fel-low
,
*NL*
For
he
's
a
jolly
good
fel-low
,
*NL*
For
he
's
a
jolly
good
fe-el-low
,
*NL*
Which
nobody
can
deny
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Driscoll
drank
.
It
was
his
second
glass
,
for
he
had
drunk
Angelo
's
*NL*
the
moment
that
Angelo
had
set
it
down
.
The
two
drinks
made
him
very
*NL*
merry
--
almost
idiotically
so
,
and
he
began
to
take
a
most
lively
and
*NL*
prominent
part
in
the
proceedings
,
particularly
in
the
music
and
catcalls
*NL*
and
side
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chairman
was
still
standing
at
the
front
,
the
twins
at
his
side
.
The
*NL*
extraordinarily
close
resemblance
of
the
brothers
to
each
other
suggested
*NL*
a
witticism
to
Tom
Driscoll
,
and
just
as
the
chairman
began
a
speech
he
*NL*
skipped
forward
and
said
,
with
an
air
of
tipsy
confidence
,
to
the
*NL*
audience
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boys
,
I
move
that
he
keeps
still
and
lets
this
human
philopena
snip
you
*NL*
out
a
speech
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
descriptive
aptness
of
the
phrase
caught
the
house
,
and
a
mighty
*NL*
burst
of
laughter
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Luigi
's
southern
blood
leaped
to
the
boiling
point
in
a
moment
under
the
*NL*
sharp
humiliation
of
this
insult
delivered
in
the
presence
of
four
*NL*
hundred
strangers
.
It
was
not
in
the
young
man
's
nature
to
let
the
*NL*
matter
pass
,
or
to
delay
the
squaring
of
the
account
.
He
took
a
couple
of
*NL*
strides
and
halted
behind
the
unsuspecting
joker
.
Then
he
drew
back
and
*NL*
delivered
a
kick
of
such
titanic
vigor
that
it
lifted
Tom
clear
over
the
*NL*
footlights
and
landed
him
on
the
heads
of
the
front
row
of
the
Sons
of
*NL*
Liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
a
sober
person
does
not
like
to
have
a
human
being
emptied
on
him
*NL*
when
he
is
not
doing
any
harm
;
a
person
who
is
not
sober
can
not
endure
*NL*
such
an
attention
at
all
.
The
nest
of
Sons
of
Liberty
that
Driscoll
*NL*
landed
in
had
not
a
sober
bird
in
it
;
in
fact
there
was
probably
not
an
*NL*
entirely
sober
one
in
the
auditorium
.
Driscoll
was
promptly
and
*NL*
indignantly
flung
on
the
heads
of
Sons
in
the
next
row
,
and
these
Sons
*NL*
passed
him
on
toward
the
rear
,
and
then
immediately
began
to
pummel
the
*NL*
front
row
Sons
who
had
passed
him
to
them
.
This
course
was
strictly
*NL*
followed
by
bench
after
bench
as
Driscoll
traveled
in
his
tumultuous
and
*NL*
airy
flight
toward
the
door
;
so
he
left
behind
him
an
ever-lengthening
*NL*
wake
of
raging
and
plunging
and
fighting
and
swearing
humanity
.
Down
went
*NL*
group
after
group
of
torches
,
and
presently
above
the
deafening
clatter
*NL*
of
the
gavel
,
roar
of
angry
voices
,
and
crash
of
succumbing
benches
,
rose
*NL*
the
paralyzing
cry
of
''
_
fire
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fighting
ceased
instantly
;
the
cursing
ceased
;
for
one
distinctly
*NL*
defined
moment
,
there
was
a
dead
hush
,
a
motionless
calm
,
where
the
*NL*
tempest
had
been
;
then
with
one
impulse
the
multitude
awoke
to
life
and
*NL*
energy
again
,
and
went
surging
and
struggling
and
swaying
,
this
way
and
*NL*
that
,
its
outer
edges
melting
away
through
windows
and
doors
and
*NL*
gradually
lessening
the
pressure
and
relieving
the
mass
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fireboys
were
never
on
hand
so
suddenly
before
;
for
there
was
no
*NL*
distance
to
go
this
time
,
their
quarters
being
in
the
rear
end
of
the
*NL*
market
house
,
There
was
an
engine
company
and
a
hook-and-ladder
company
.
*NL*
Half
of
each
was
composed
of
rummies
and
the
other
half
of
anti-rummies
,
*NL*
after
the
moral
and
political
share-and-share-alike
fashion
of
the
*NL*
frontier
town
of
the
period
.
Enough
anti-rummies
were
loafing
in
quarters
*NL*
to
man
the
engine
and
the
ladders
.
In
two
minutes
they
had
their
red
*NL*
shirts
and
helmets
on
--
they
never
stirred
officially
in
unofficial
*NL*
costume
--
and
as
the
mass
meeting
overhead
smashed
through
the
long
row
of
*NL*
windows
and
poured
out
upon
the
roof
of
the
arcade
,
the
deliverers
were
*NL*
ready
for
them
with
a
powerful
stream
of
water
,
which
washed
some
of
them
*NL*
off
the
roof
and
nearly
drowned
the
rest
.
But
water
was
preferable
to
*NL*
fire
,
and
still
the
stampede
from
the
windows
continued
,
and
still
the
*NL*
pitiless
drenching
assailed
it
until
the
building
was
empty
;
then
the
*NL*
fireboys
mounted
to
the
hall
and
flooded
it
with
water
enough
to
*NL*
annihilate
forty
times
as
much
fire
as
there
was
there
;
for
a
village
*NL*
fire
company
does
not
often
get
a
chance
to
show
off
,
and
so
when
it
does
*NL*
get
a
chance
,
it
makes
the
most
of
it
.
Such
citizens
of
that
village
as
*NL*
were
of
a
thoughtful
and
judicious
temperament
did
not
insure
against
*NL*
fire
;
they
insured
against
the
fire
company
.

CHAPTER
12
--
The
Shame
of
Judge
Driscoll
*NL*
*NL*
_
Courage
is
resistance
to
fear
,
mastery
of
fear
--
not
absence
*NL*
of
fear
.
Except
a
creature
be
part
coward
,
it
is
not
a
*NL*
compliment
to
say
it
is
brave
;
it
is
merely
a
loose
*NL*
misapplication
of
the
word
.
Consider
the
flea
!
--
incomparably
*NL*
the
bravest
of
all
the
creatures
of
God
,
if
ignorance
of
*NL*
fear
were
courage
.
Whether
you
are
asleep
or
awake
he
will
*NL*
attack
you
,
caring
nothing
for
the
fact
that
in
bulk
and
*NL*
strength
you
are
to
him
as
are
the
massed
armies
of
the
*NL*
earth
to
a
sucking
child
;
he
lives
both
day
and
night
and
*NL*
all
days
and
nights
in
the
very
lap
of
peril
and
the
*NL*
immediate
presence
of
death
,
and
yet
is
no
more
afraid
than
*NL*
is
the
man
who
walks
the
streets
of
a
city
that
was
*NL*
threatened
by
an
earthquake
ten
centuries
before
.
When
we
*NL*
speak
of
Clive
,
Nelson
,
and
Putnam
as
men
who
``
did
n't
know
*NL*
what
fear
was
,
''
we
ought
always
to
add
the
flea
--
and
put
him
*NL*
at
the
head
of
the
procession
.

Pudd
`

Wilson
's
*NL*
Calendar
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Driscoll
was
in
bed
and
asleep
by
ten
o'clock
on
Friday
night
,
and
*NL*
he
was
up
and
gone
a-fishing
before
daylight
in
the
morning
with
his
*NL*
friend
Pembroke
Howard
.
These
two
had
been
boys
together
in
Virginia
*NL*
when
that
state
still
ranked
as
the
chief
and
most
imposing
member
of
the
*NL*
Union
,
and
they
still
coupled
the
proud
and
affectionate
adjective
``
old
''
*NL*
with
her
name
when
they
spoke
of
her
.
In
Missouri
a
recognized
*NL*
superiority
attached
to
any
person
who
hailed
from
Old
Virginia
;
and
this
*NL*
superiority
was
exalted
to
supremacy
when
a
person
of
such
nativity
could
*NL*
also
prove
descent
from
the
First
Families
of
that
great
commonwealth
.
*NL*
The
Howards
and
Driscolls
were
of
this
aristocracy
.
In
their
eyes
,
it
*NL*
was
a
nobility
.
It
had
its
unwritten
laws
,
and
they
were
as
clearly
*NL*
defined
and
as
strict
as
any
that
could
be
found
among
the
printed
*NL*
statutes
of
the
land
.
The
F.F.V.
was
born
a
gentleman
;
his
highest
duty
in
*NL*
life
was
to
watch
over
that
great
inheritance
and
keep
it
unsmirched
.
He
*NL*
must
keep
his
honor
spotless
.
Those
laws
were
his
chart
;
his
course
was
*NL*
marked
out
on
it
;
if
he
swerved
from
it
by
so
much
as
half
a
point
of
the
*NL*
compass
,
it
meant
shipwreck
to
his
honor
;
that
is
to
say
,
degradation
*NL*
from
his
rank
as
a
gentleman
.
These
laws
required
certain
things
of
him
*NL*
which
his
religion
might
forbid
:
then
his
religion
must
yield
--
the
laws
*NL*
could
not
be
relaxed
to
accommodate
religions
or
anything
else
.
Honor
*NL*
stood
first
;
and
the
laws
defined
what
it
was
and
wherein
it
differed
in
*NL*
certain
details
from
honor
as
defined
by
church
creeds
and
by
the
social
*NL*
laws
and
customs
of
some
of
the
minor
divisions
of
the
globe
that
had
got
*NL*
crowded
out
when
the
sacred
boundaries
of
Virginia
were
staked
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Judge
Driscoll
was
the
recognized
first
citizen
of
Dawson
's
Landing
,
*NL*
Pembroke
Howard
was
easily
its
recognized
second
citizen
.
He
was
called
*NL*
``
the
great
lawyer
''
--
an
earned
title
.
He
and
Driscoll
were
of
the
same
*NL*
age
--
a
year
or
two
past
sixty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Driscoll
was
a
freethinker
and
Howard
a
strong
and
determined
*NL*
Presbyterian
,
their
warm
intimacy
suffered
no
impairment
in
consequence
.
*NL*
They
were
men
whose
opinions
were
their
own
property
and
not
subject
to
*NL*
revision
and
amendment
,
suggestion
or
criticism
,
by
anybody
,
even
their
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
's
fishing
finished
,
they
came
floating
downstream
in
their
skiff
,
*NL*
talking
national
politics
and
other
high
matters
,
and
presently
met
a
*NL*
skiff
coming
up
from
town
,
with
a
man
in
it
who
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
you
know
one
of
the
new
twins
gave
your
nephew
a
kicking
last
*NL*
night
,
Judge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
WHAT
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gave
him
a
kicking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
judge
's
lips
paled
,
and
his
eyes
began
to
flame
.
He
choked
with
*NL*
anger
for
a
moment
,
then
he
got
out
what
he
was
trying
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
well
--
go
on
!
Give
me
the
details
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
did
it
.
At
the
finish
the
judge
was
silent
a
minute
,
turning
*NL*
over
in
his
mind
the
shameful
picture
of
Tom
's
flight
over
the
*NL*
footlights
;
then
he
said
,
as
if
musing
aloud
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
--
I
do
n't
understand
it
.
I
was
asleep
at
home
.
He
did
n't
wake
me
.
*NL*
Thought
he
was
competent
to
manage
his
affair
without
my
help
,
I
reckon
.
''
*NL*
His
face
lit
up
with
pride
and
pleasure
at
that
thought
,
and
he
said
with
*NL*
a
cheery
complacency
,
``
I
like
that
--
it
's
the
true
old
blood
--
hey
,
*NL*
Pembroke
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Howard
smiled
an
iron
smile
,
and
nodded
his
head
approvingly
.
Then
the
*NL*
news-bringer
spoke
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Tom
beat
the
twin
on
the
trial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
judge
looked
at
the
man
wonderingly
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
trial
?
What
trial
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Tom
had
him
up
before
Judge
Robinson
for
assault
and
battery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
shrank
suddenly
together
like
one
who
has
received
a
death
*NL*
stroke
.
Howard
sprang
for
him
as
he
sank
forward
in
a
swoon
,
and
took
*NL*
him
in
his
arms
,
and
bedded
him
on
his
back
in
the
boat
.
He
sprinkled
*NL*
water
in
his
face
,
and
said
to
the
startled
visitor
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
now
--
do
n't
let
him
come
to
and
find
you
here
.
You
see
what
an
*NL*
effect
your
heedless
speech
has
had
;
you
ought
to
have
been
more
*NL*
considerate
than
to
blurt
out
such
a
cruel
piece
of
slander
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
right
down
sorry
I
did
it
now
,
Mr.
Howard
,
and
I
would
n't
have
done
*NL*
it
if
I
had
thought
;
but
it
ai
n't
slander
;
it
's
perfectly
true
,
just
as
I
*NL*
told
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rowed
away
.
Presently
the
old
judge
came
out
of
his
faint
and
looked
*NL*
up
piteously
into
the
sympathetic
face
that
was
bent
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
it
ai
n't
true
,
Pembroke
;
tell
me
it
ai
n't
true
!
''
he
said
in
a
weak
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
weak
in
the
deep
organ
tones
that
responded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
it
's
a
lie
as
well
as
I
do
,
old
friend
.
He
is
of
the
best
*NL*
blood
of
the
Old
Dominion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
for
saying
it
!
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
fervently
.
``
Ah
,
*NL*
Pembroke
,
it
was
such
a
blow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Howard
stayed
by
his
friend
,
and
saw
him
home
,
and
entered
the
house
with
*NL*
him
.
It
was
dark
,
and
past
supper-time
,
but
the
judge
was
not
thinking
*NL*
of
supper
;
he
was
eager
to
hear
the
slander
refuted
from
headquarters
,
*NL*
and
as
eager
to
have
Howard
hear
it
,
too
.
Tom
was
sent
for
,
and
he
came
*NL*
immediately
.
He
was
bruised
and
lame
,
and
was
not
a
happy-looking
*NL*
object
.
His
uncle
made
him
sit
down
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
hearing
about
your
adventure
,
Tom
,
with
a
handsome
lie
*NL*
added
for
embellishment
.
Now
pulverize
that
lie
to
dust
!
What
measures
*NL*
have
you
taken
?
How
does
the
thing
stand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
answered
guilelessly
:
``
It
do
n't
stand
at
all
;
it
's
all
over
.
I
had
*NL*
him
up
in
court
and
beat
him
.
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
defended
him
--
first
*NL*
case
he
ever
had
,
and
lost
it
.
The
judge
fined
the
miserable
hound
five
*NL*
dollars
for
the
assault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Howard
and
the
judge
sprang
to
their
feet
with
the
opening
sentence
*NL*
--
why
,
neither
knew
;
then
they
stood
gazing
vacantly
at
each
other
.
*NL*
Howard
stood
a
moment
,
then
sat
mournfully
down
without
saying
anything
.
*NL*
The
judge
's
wrath
began
to
kindle
,
and
he
burst
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
cur
!
You
scum
!
You
vermin
!
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
blood
of
*NL*
my
race
has
suffered
a
blow
and
crawled
to
a
court
of
law
about
it
?
*NL*
Answer
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
head
drooped
,
and
he
answered
with
an
eloquent
silence
.
His
uncle
*NL*
stared
at
him
with
a
mixed
expression
of
amazement
and
shame
and
*NL*
incredulity
that
was
sorrowful
to
see
.
At
last
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
of
the
twins
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Luigi
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
challenged
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
N
--
no
,
''
hesitated
Tom
,
turning
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
challenge
him
tonight
.
Howard
will
carry
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
began
to
turn
sick
,
and
to
show
it
.
He
turned
his
hat
round
and
*NL*
round
in
his
hand
,
his
uncle
glowering
blacker
and
blacker
upon
him
as
*NL*
the
heavy
seconds
drifted
by
;
then
at
last
he
began
to
stammer
,
and
said
*NL*
piteously
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
,
do
n't
ask
me
to
do
it
,
uncle
!
He
is
a
murderous
devil

I
*NL*
never
could

I
--
I
'm
afraid
of
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Driscoll
's
mouth
opened
and
closed
three
times
before
he
could
get
it
*NL*
to
perform
its
office
;
then
he
stormed
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
coward
in
my
family
!
A
Driscoll
a
coward
!
Oh
,
what
have
I
done
to
*NL*
deserve
this
infamy
!
''
He
tottered
to
his
secretary
in
the
corner
,
*NL*
repeated
that
lament
again
and
again
in
heartbreaking
tones
,
and
got
out
*NL*
of
a
drawer
a
paper
,
which
he
slowly
tore
to
bits
,
scattering
the
bits
*NL*
absently
in
his
track
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
,
still
grieving
*NL*
and
lamenting
.
At
last
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
is
,
shreds
and
fragments
once
more
--
my
will
.
Once
more
you
*NL*
have
forced
me
to
disinherit
you
,
you
base
son
of
a
most
noble
father
!
*NL*
Leave
my
sight
!
Go
--
before
I
spit
on
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
did
not
tarry
.
Then
the
judge
turned
to
Howard
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
my
second
,
old
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
pen
and
paper
.
Draft
the
cartel
,
and
lose
no
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Count
shall
have
it
in
his
hands
in
fifteen
minutes
,
''
said
Howard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
very
heavyhearted
.
His
appetite
was
gone
with
his
property
and
*NL*
his
self-respect
.
He
went
out
the
back
way
and
wandered
down
the
obscure
*NL*
lane
grieving
,
and
wondering
if
any
course
of
future
conduct
,
however
*NL*
discreet
and
carefully
perfected
and
watched
over
,
could
win
back
his
*NL*
uncle
's
favor
and
persuade
him
to
reconstruct
once
more
that
generous
*NL*
will
which
had
just
gone
to
ruin
before
his
eyes
.
He
finally
concluded
*NL*
that
it
could
.
He
said
to
himself
that
he
had
accomplished
this
sort
of
*NL*
triumph
once
already
,
and
that
what
had
been
done
once
could
be
done
*NL*
again
.
He
would
set
about
it
.
He
would
bend
every
energy
to
the
task
,
*NL*
and
he
would
score
that
triumph
once
more
,
cost
what
it
might
to
his
*NL*
convenience
,
limit
as
it
might
his
frivolous
and
liberty-loving
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
begin
,
''
he
says
to
himself
,
``
I
'll
square
up
with
the
proceeds
of
my
*NL*
raid
,
and
then
gambling
has
got
to
be
stopped
--
and
stopped
short
off
.
*NL*
It
's
the
worst
vice
I
've
got
--
from
my
standpoint
,
anyway
,
because
it
's
*NL*
the
one
he
can
most
easily
find
out
,
through
the
impatience
of
my
*NL*
creditors
.
He
thought
it
expensive
to
have
to
pay
two
hundred
dollars
to
*NL*
them
for
me
once
.
Expensive
--
_
that
!
_
Why
,
it
cost
me
the
whole
of
his
*NL*
fortune
--
but
,
of
course
,
he
never
thought
of
that
;
some
people
ca
n't
*NL*
think
of
any
but
their
own
side
of
a
case
.
If
he
had
known
how
deep
I
am
*NL*
in
now
,
the
will
would
have
gone
to
pot
without
waiting
for
a
duel
to
*NL*
help
.
Three
hundred
dollars
!
It
's
a
pile
!
But
he
'll
never
hear
of
it
,
*NL*
I
'm
thankful
to
say
.
The
minute
I
've
cleared
it
off
,
I
'm
safe
;
and
I
'll
*NL*
never
touch
a
card
again
.
Anyway
,
I
wo
n't
while
he
lives
,
I
make
oath
to
*NL*
that
.
I
'm
entering
on
my
last
reform
--
I
know
it
--
yes
,
and
I
'll
win
;
but
*NL*
after
that
,
if
I
ever
slip
again
I
'm
gone

Thus
mournfully
communing
with
himself
,
Tom
moped
along
the
lane
past
*NL*
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
's
house
,
and
still
on
and
on
between
fences
enclosing
*NL*
vacant
country
on
each
hand
till
he
neared
the
haunted
house
,
then
he
*NL*
came
moping
back
again
,
with
many
sighs
and
heavy
with
trouble
.
He
sorely
*NL*
wanted
cheerful
company
.
Rowena
!
His
heart
gave
a
bound
at
the
thought
,
*NL*
but
the
next
thought
quieted
it
--
the
detested
twins
would
be
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
on
the
inhabited
side
of
Wilson
's
house
,
and
now
as
he
approached
*NL*
it
,
he
noticed
that
the
sitting
room
was
lighted
.
This
would
do
;
others
*NL*
made
him
feel
unwelcome
sometimes
,
but
Wilson
never
failed
in
courtesy
*NL*
toward
him
,
and
a
kindly
courtesy
does
at
least
save
one
's
feelings
,
even
*NL*
if
it
is
not
professing
to
stand
for
a
welcome
.
Wilson
heard
footsteps
at
*NL*
his
threshold
,
then
the
clearing
of
a
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
that
fickle-tempered
,
dissipated
young
goose
--
poor
devil
,

find
*NL*
friends
pretty
scarce
today
,
likely
,
after
the
disgrace
of
carrying
a
*NL*
personal
assault
case
into
a
law-court
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
dejected
knock
.
``
Come
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
entered
,
and
dropped
into
a
chair
,
without
saying
anything
.
Wilson
*NL*
said
kindly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
boy
,
you
look
desolate

Do
n't
take
it

hard

you
have
been
kicked

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
Tom
,
wretchedly
,
``
it

not

Pudd

it

not

It
's

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Tom

*NL*
*NL*
``
Flung
me

_
No

the

''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
said
to
himself
,
``
Aha
!
''
and
thought
of
the
mysterious
girl
in
the
*NL*
bedroom
.
``
The
Driscolls
have
been
making
discoveries
!
''
Then
he
said
*NL*
aloud
,
gravely
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
there
are
some
kinds
of
dissipation
which
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shucks
,
this
has
n't
got
anything
to
do
with
dissipation

He
wanted
*NL*
me
to
challenge
that
derned
Italian
savage
,
and
I
would
n't
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
he
would
do
that
,
''
said
Wilson
in
a
meditative
*NL*
matter-of-course
way
,
``
but
the
thing
that
puzzled
me
was
,
why
he
did
n't
*NL*
look
to
that
last
night
,
for
one
thing
,
and
why
he
let
you
carry
such
a
*NL*
matter
into
a
court
of
law
at
all
,
either
before
the
duel
or
after
it
.
*NL*
It
's
no
place
for
it
.
It
was
not
like
him

I
could
n't
understand
it

*NL*
How
did
it
happen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
happened
because
he
did
n't
know
anything
about
it

He
was
asleep
*NL*
when
I
got
home
last
night
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
did
n't
wake
him
?
Tom
,
is
that
possible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
not
getting
much
comfort
here
.
He
fidgeted
a
moment
,
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
choose
to
tell
him

that

all

He
was
going
a-fishing
before

dawn
,
with
Pembroke
Howard
,
and
if
I
got
the
twins
into
the
common
*NL*
calaboose
--
and
I
thought
sure
I
could
--
I
never
dreamed
of
their
slipping
*NL*
out
on
a
paltry
fine
for
such
an
outrageous
offense
--
well
,
once
in
the
*NL*
calaboose
they
would
be
disgraced
,
and
uncle
would
n't
want
any
duels
with

that
sort
of
characters

would
n't
allow
any

``

I
do

see

you
could
treat
your
good
old

uncle
so

I
am
a
better
friend
of
his
than
you
are
;
for
if
I
had
known
*NL*
the
circumstances
I
would
have
kept
that
case
out
of
court

I
got

word

him

let
him
have
the
gentleman

chance

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would

exclaimed
Tom
,
with
lively
surprise

it
your

never
would
have

been

any

if

had
got
that
chance

you
'd
have
finished
your

a
pauper
nobody

being

actually

done

you

*NL*
``
Certainly

Tom
looked
at
him
a
moment

two

then
shook
his
head
sorrowfully

*NL*
said
:

refused

He
watched
the
young
fellow

face
narrowly
,
but
it
was
entirely
*NL*
reposeful
,
and
so
also
was
the
voice

answered

No

in

humor

He
*NL*
drove

jack-pair
around

showed

the
sights

when

came
home
he
could

find
his

old
silver
watch

he
thinks
so
much

three

four
days

he
saw
it
last

when
I
suggested
that
it
*NL*
probably
was

lost

stolen

it
put
him
in
a
regular
passion

he
*NL*
said
I
was
a
fool

convinced
me

just
what

was
afraid

happened

himself

did
not

of
the
*NL*
reception
at
Patsy
Cooper
's
when
all
the
neighbors
were
in
her
house
and
*NL*
all
their
niggers
hanging
around
her
fence
for
a
look
at
the
show
,
to
*NL*
raid
the
vacant
houses
undisturbed
.
Patsy
is
miserable
about
it
;
*NL*
miserable
on
account
of
the
neighbors
,
and
particularly
miserable
on
*NL*
account
of
her
foreigners
,
of
course
;
so
miserable
on
their
account
that
*NL*
she
has
n't
any
room
to
worry
about
her
own
little
losses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
same
old
raider
,
''
said
Wilson
.
``
I
suppose
there
is
n't
any
*NL*
doubt
about
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Constable
Blake
does
n't
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
're
wrong
there
,
''
said
Blake
.
``
The
other
times
it
was
a
man
;
*NL*
there
was
plenty
of
signs
of
that
,
as
we
know
,
in
the
profession
,
though
*NL*
we
never
got
hands
on
him
;
but
this
time
it
's
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
thought
of
the
mysterious
girl
straight
off
.
She
was
always
in
*NL*
his
mind
now
.
But
she
failed
him
again
.
Blake
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
stoop-shouldered
old
woman
with
a
covered
basket
on
her
arm
,
in
*NL*
a
black
veil
,
dressed
in
mourning
.
I
saw
her
going
aboard
the
ferryboat
*NL*
yesterday
.
Lives
in
Illinois
,
I
reckon
;
but
I
do
n't
care
where
she
*NL*
lives
,
I
'm
going
to
get
her
--
she
can
make
herself
sure
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
think
she
's
the
thief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
ai
n't
any
other
,
for
one
thing
;
and
for
another
,
some
nigger
*NL*
draymen
that
happened
to
be
driving
along
saw
her
coming
out
of
or
going
*NL*
into
houses
,
and
told
me
so
--
and
it
just
happens
that
they
was
_
robbed
_
,
*NL*
every
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
granted
that
this
was
plenty
good
enough
circumstantial
evidence
.
*NL*
A
pensive
silence
followed
,
which
lasted
some
moments
,
then
Wilson
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
good
thing
,
anyway
.
She
ca
n't
either
pawn
or
sell
Count
*NL*
Luigi
's
costly
Indian
dagger
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
Tom

``
Is

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

that
was
a
haul
!
But
why
ca
n't
she
pawn
it

sell
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
when
the
twins
went
home
from
the
Sons
of
Liberty
meeting
last
*NL*
night
,
news
of
the
raid
was
sifting
in
from
everywhere
,
and
Aunt
Patsy
*NL*
was
in
distress
to
know
if
they
had
lost
anything
.
They
found
that
the
*NL*
dagger
was
gone
,
and
they
notified
the
police
and
pawnbrokers
everywhere
.
*NL*
It
was
a
great
haul
,
yes
,
but
the
old
woman
wo
n't
get
anything
out
of
it
,
*NL*
because
she
'll
get
caught
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
they
offer
a
reward
?
''
asked
Buckstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
five
hundred
dollars
for
the
knife
,
and
five
hundred
more
for
the
*NL*
thief

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
leather-headed
idea
!
''
exclaimed
the
constable
.
``
The
thief

'n'
t
*NL*
go
near

send
anybody

Whoever
goes
is
going

himself

nabbed

for
their
ai
n't
any
pawnbroker
that
's
going
to
lose
the
chance
*NL*
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
anybody
had
noticed
Tom
's
face
at
that
time
,
the
gray-green
color
of
*NL*
it
might
have
provoked
curiosity
;
but
nobody
did
.
He
said
to
himself
:
*NL*
``
I
'm
gone
!
I
never
can
square
up
;
the
rest
of
the
plunder
wo
n't
pawn

sell
for
half
of
the
bill
.
Oh
,
I
know
it
--
I

gone

I
'm
gone

and
this
*NL*
time
it
's
for

Oh

this
is
awful

I
do

know
what
to
do
,

*NL*
which
way
to
turn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Softly
,
softly
,
''
said
Wilson
to
Blake
.
``
I
planned
their
scheme
for
them
*NL*
at
midnight
last
night
,
and
it
was
all
finished
up
shipshape
by
two
this
*NL*
morning
.
They
'll
get
their
dagger
back
,
and
then
I
'll
explain
to
you
how
*NL*
the
thing
was
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
strong
signs
of
a
general
curiosity
,
and
Buckstone
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
have
whetted
us
up
pretty
sharp
,
Wilson
,
and
I
'm
free
to
say
*NL*
that
if
you
do
n't
mind
telling
us
in
confidence

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'd
as
soon
tell
as
not
,
Buckstone
,
but
as
long
as
the
twins
and
I
*NL*
agreed
to
say
nothing
about
it
,
we
must
let
it
stand
so
.
But
you
can
take
*NL*
my
word
for
it
,
you
wo
n't
be
kept
waiting
three
days
.
Somebody
will
apply
*NL*
for
that
reward
pretty
promptly
,
and
I
'll
show
you
the
thief
and
the
*NL*
dagger
both
very
soon
afterward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
constable
was
disappointed
,
and
also
perplexed
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
all
be
--
yes
,
and
I
hope
it
will
,
but
I
'm
blamed
if
I
can
see
my
*NL*
way
through
it
.
It
's
too
many
for
yours
truly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
seemed
about
talked
out
.
Nobody
seemed
to
have
anything
*NL*
further
to
offer
.
After
a
silence
the
justice
of
the
peace
informed
*NL*
Wilson
that
he
and
Buckstone
and
the
constable
had
come
as
a
committee
,
*NL*
on
the
part
of
the
Democratic
party
,
to
ask
him
to
run
for
mayor
--
for
the
*NL*
little
town
was
about
to
become
a
city
and
the
first
charter
election
was
*NL*
approaching
.
It
was
the
first
attention
which
Wilson
had
ever
received
*NL*
at
the
hands
of
any
party
;
it
was
a
sufficiently
humble
one
,
but
it
was
a
*NL*
recognition
of
his
debut
into
the
town
's
life
and
activities
at
last
;
it
*NL*
was
a
step
upward
,
and
he
was
deeply
gratified
.
He
accepted
,
and
the
*NL*
committee
departed
,
followed
by
young
Tom
.

Upon

_
The
true
Southern
watermelon
is
a
boon
apart
,
and
not
to
be
*NL*
mentioned
with
commoner
things

It
is

of

luxuries

king
by
the

of
God

not

Calendar
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
time
that
Wilson
was
bowing
the
committee
out
,
Pembroke
Howard
*NL*
was
entering
the
next
house
to
report
.
He
found
the
old
judge
sitting
*NL*
grim
and
straight
in
his
chair
,
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Howard
--
the
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
in
the
world

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accepts
,
does
he
?
''
and
the
light
of
battle
gleamed
joyously
in
the
*NL*
Judge
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accepts
?
Why
he
jumped
at
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

he

Now

's
fine

's

When

*NL*
it
to

Why

an

as

stand
up
before
such
a
man

Come

off

Go
and
arrange

give
him
my

A

you
have
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
have
him
in
the
vacant
stretch
between
Wilson
's
and
the
haunted

house
within
the
hour

and
I
'll
bring
my

pistols

*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Driscoll
began
to
walk
the
floor
in
a
state
of
pleased
excitement
;
*NL*
but
presently
he
stopped
,
and
began
to
think
--
began
to
think
of
Tom
.
*NL*
Twice
he
moved
toward
the
secretary
,
and
twice
he
turned
away
again
;
but
*NL*
finally
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
may
be
my
last
night
in
the
world
--
I
must
not
take
the
chance
.
He
*NL*
is
worthless
and
unworthy
,
but
it
is
largely
my
fault
.
He
was
entrusted
*NL*
to
me
by
my
brother
on
his
dying
bed
,
and
I
have
indulged
him
to
his
*NL*
hurt
,
instead
of
training
him
up
severely
,
and
making
a
man
of
him
,
I
*NL*
have
violated
my
trust
,
and
I
must
not
add
the
sin
of
desertion
to
that
.
*NL*
I
have
forgiven
him
once
already
,
and
would
subject
him
to
a
long
and
*NL*
hard
trial
before
forgiving
him
again
,
if
I
could
live
;
but
I
must
not
*NL*
run
that
risk
.
No
,
I
must
restore
the
will
.
But
if
I
survive
the
duel
,
I
*NL*
will
hide
it
away
,
and
he
will
not
know
,
and
I
will
not
tell
him
until
he
*NL*
reforms
,
and
I
see
that
his
reformation
is
going
to
be
permanent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
redrew
the
will
,
and
his
ostensible
nephew
was
heir
to
a
fortune
*NL*
again
.
As
he
was
finishing
his
task
,
Tom
,
wearied
with
another
brooding
*NL*
tramp
,
entered
the
house
and
went
tiptoeing
past
the
sitting
room
door
.
*NL*
He
glanced
in
,
and
hurried
on
,
for
the
sight
of
his
uncle
was
nothing
but
*NL*
terrors
for
him
tonight
.
But
his
uncle
was
writing
!
That
was
unusual
at
*NL*
this
late
hour
.
What
could
he
be
writing
?
A
chill
of
anxiety
settled
*NL*
down
upon
Tom
's
heart
.
Did
that
writing
concern
him
?
He
was
afraid
so
.
*NL*
He
reflected
that
when
ill
luck
begins
,
it
does
not
come
in
sprinkles
,
*NL*
but
in
showers
.
He
said
he
would
get
a
glimpse
of
that
document
or
know
*NL*
the
reason
why
.
He
heard
someone
coming
,
and
stepped
out
of
sight
and
*NL*
hearing
.
It
was
Pembroke
Howard
.
What
could
be
hatching
?
*NL*
*NL*
Howard
said
,
with
great
satisfaction
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
's
right
and
ready
.
He
's
gone
to
the
battleground
with
his
*NL*
second
and
the
surgeon

also
with
his
brother

I
've
arranged
it
all
with
*NL*
Wilson

Wilson
's
his
second

We
are
to
have
three
shots
apiece

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

How
is
the
moon

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bright
as

nearly

Perfect

fifteen
yards

No
*NL*

not
a
breath
;
hot
and
still

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
good
;
all
first-rate

Here
,
Pembroke
,
read
this
,
and
witness
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Pembroke
read
and
witnessed
the
will
,
then
gave
the
old
man
's
hand
a
*NL*
hearty
shake
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
's
right
,
York
--
but
I
knew
you
would
do
it
.
You
could
n't
leave
*NL*
that
poor
chap
to
fight
along
without
means
or
profession
,
with
certain
*NL*
defeat
before
him
,
and
I
knew
you
would
n't
,
for
his
father
's
sake
if
not
*NL*
for
his
own

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
his
dead
father
's
sake

I
could
n't

I
know

for
poor
Percy
--
but
you
*NL*
know
what
Percy
was
to
me
.
But
mind
--
Tom
is
not
to
know
of
this
unless
I
*NL*
fall
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
.
I
'll
keep
the
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
judge
put
the
will
away
,
and
the
two
started
for
the
battleground
.
In
*NL*
another
minute
the
will
was
in
Tom
's
hands
.
His
misery
vanished
,
his
*NL*
feelings
underwent
a
tremendous
revulsion
.
He
put
the
will
carefully
back
*NL*
in
its
place
,
and
spread
his
mouth
and
swung
his
hat
once
,
twice
,
three
*NL*
times
around
his
head
,
in
imitation
of
three
rousing
huzzahs
,
no
sound
*NL*
issuing
from
his
lips
.
He
fell
to
communing
with
himself
excitedly
and
*NL*
joyously
,
but
every
now
and
then
he
let
off
another
volley
of
dumb
*NL*
hurrahs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
to
himself
:
``
I
've
got
the
fortune
again
,
but
I
'll
not
let
on
*NL*
that
I
know
about
it
.
And
this
time
I
'm
going
to
hang
on
to
it
.
I
take
no
*NL*
more
risks
.
I
'll
gamble
no
more
,
I
'll
drink
no
more
,
because
--
well
,
*NL*
because
I
'll
not
go
where
there
is
any
of
that
sort
of
thing
going
on
,
*NL*
again
.
It
's
the
sure
way
,
and
the
only
sure
way
;
I
might
have
thought
of
*NL*
that
sooner
--
well
,
yes
,
if
I
had
wanted
to
.
But
now
--
dear
me
,
I
've
had
a
*NL*
scare
this
time
,
and
I
'll
take
no
more
chances
.
Not
a
single
chance
*NL*
more

Land
!
I
persuaded
myself
this
evening
that
I
could
fetch
him
*NL*
around
without
any
great
amount
of
effort
,
but
I
've
been
getting
more
and
*NL*
more
heavyhearted
and
doubtful
straight
along
,
ever
since
.
If
he
tells
*NL*
me
about
this
thing
,
all
right
;
but
if
he
does
n't
,
I
sha
'n'

let
on

I
--
well
,
I
'd
like
to
tell
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
,
but
--
no
,
I
'll
think
about
*NL*
that
;
perhaps
I
wo
n't

''
He
whirled
off
another
dead
huzzah
,
and
said
,
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
about
to
close
with
a
final
grand
silent
demonstration
,
when
he
*NL*
suddenly
recollected
that
Wilson
had
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
pawn
or
*NL*
sell
the
Indian
knife
,
and
that
he
was
once
more
in
awful
peril
of
*NL*
exposure
by
his
creditors
for
that
reason
.
His
joy
collapsed
utterly
,
and
*NL*
he
turned
away
and
moped
toward
the
door
moaning
and
lamenting
over
the
*NL*
bitterness
of
his
luck
.
He
dragged
himself
upstairs
,
and
brooded
in
his
*NL*
room
a
long
time
,
disconsolate
and
forlorn
,
with
Luigi
's
Indian
knife
for
*NL*
a
text
.
At
last
he
sighed
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
supposed
these
stones
were
glass
and
this
ivory
bone
,
the
thing
*NL*
had
n't
any
interest
for
me
because
it
had
n't
any
value
,
and
could
n't
help
*NL*
me
out
of
my
trouble
.
But
now
--
why
,
now
it
is
full
of
interest
;
yes
,
and
*NL*
of
a
sort
to
break
a
body
's
heart
.
It
's
a
bag
of
gold
that
has
turned
to
*NL*
dirt
and
ashes
in
my
hands
.
It
could
save
me
,
and
save
me
so
easily
,
and
*NL*
yet
I
've
got
to
go
to
ruin
.
It
's
like
drowning
with
a
life
preserver
in
*NL*
my
reach
.
All
the
hard
luck
comes
to
me
,
and
all
the
good
luck
goes
to
*NL*
other
people
--
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
,
for
instance
;
even
his
career
has
got
a
*NL*
sort
of
a
little
start
at
last
,
and
what
has
he
done
to
deserve
it
,
I
*NL*
should
like
to
know
?
Yes
,
he
has
opened
his
own
road
,
but
he
is
n't
*NL*
content
with
that
,
but
must
block
mine
.
It
's
a
sordid
,
selfish
world
,
and
*NL*
I
wish
I
was
out
of
it
.
''
He
allowed
the
light
of
the
candle
to
play
upon
*NL*
the
jewels
of
the
sheath
,
but
the
flashings
and
sparklings
had
no
charm
*NL*
for
his
eye
;
they
were
only
just
so
many
pangs
to
his
heart
.
``
I
must
not
*NL*
say
anything
to
Roxy
about
this
thing
,
''
he
said
.
``
She
is
too
daring
.
She
*NL*
would
be
for
digging
these
stones
out
and
selling
them
,
and
then
--
why
,
*NL*
she
would
be
arrested
and
the
stones
traced
,
and
then
--
''
The
thought
made
*NL*
him
quake
,
and
he
hid
the
knife
away
,
trembling
all
over
and
glancing
*NL*
furtively
about
,
like
a
criminal
who
fancies
that
the
accuser
is
already
*NL*
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Should
he
try
to
sleep
?
Oh
,
no
,
sleep
was
not
for
him
;
his
trouble
was
*NL*
too
haunting
,
too
afflicting
for
that
.
He
must
have
somebody
to
mourn
*NL*
with
.
He
would
carry
his
despair
to
Roxy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
heard
several
distant
gunshots
,
but
that
sort
of
thing
was
not
*NL*
uncommon
,
and
they
had
made
no
impression
upon
him
.
He
went
out
at
the
*NL*
back
door
,
and
turned
westward
.
He
passed
Wilson
's
house
and
proceeded
*NL*
along
the
lane
,
and
presently
saw
several
figures
approaching
Wilson
's
*NL*
place
through
the
vacant
lots
.
These
were
the
duelists
returning
from
the
*NL*
fight
;
he
thought
he
recognized
them
,
but
as
he
had
no
desire
for
white
*NL*
people
's
company
,
he
stooped
down
behind
the
fence
until
they
were
out
of
*NL*
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Roxy
was
feeling
fine
.
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whah
was
you
,
child
?
War
n't
you
in
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great

!
''
Then
he
added
to
himself
:
``
That
's
what
made
him
remake
*NL*
the
will
;
he
thought
he
might
get
killed
,
and
it
softened
him
toward
me
.
*NL*
And
that
's
what
he
and
Howard
were
so
busy
about
...
Oh
dear
,
if
the
*NL*
twin
had
only
killed
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I

The

tried
to
get
me
to
fight
one
with
Count
*NL*
Luigi
,
but
he
did
n't
succeed
,
so
I
reckon
he
concluded
to
patch
up
the
*NL*
family
honor
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
at
the
idea
,
and
went
rambling
on
with
a
detailed
account
of
*NL*
his
talk
with
the
judge
,
and
how
shocked
and
ashamed
the
judge
was
to
*NL*
find
that
he
had
a
coward
in
his
family
.
He
glanced
up
at
last
,
and
got
*NL*
a
shock
himself
.
Roxana
's
bosom
was
heaving
with
suppressed
passion
,
and
*NL*
she
was
glowering
down
upon
him
with
measureless
contempt
written
in
her
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
last
three
sentences
stung
Tom
into
a
fury
,
and
he
said
to
himself
*NL*
that
if
his
father
were
only
alive
and
in
reach
of
assassination
his
*NL*
mother
would
soon
find
that
he
had
a
very
clear
notion
of
the
size
of
his
*NL*
indebtedness
to
that
man
,
and
was
willing
to
pay
it
up
in
full
,
and
would
*NL*
do
it
too
,
even
at
risk
of
his
life
;
but
he
kept
this
thought
to
himself
;
*NL*
that
was
safest
in
his
mother
's
present
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
on
her
candle
box
and
fell
into
a
reverie
.
Tom
did
not
*NL*
disturb
her
;
he
sometimes
lacked
prudence
,
but
it
was
not
in
*NL*
circumstances
of
this
kind
,
Roxana
's
storm
went
gradually
down
,
but
it
*NL*
died
hard
,
and
even
when
it
seemed
to
be
quite
gone
,
it
would
now
and
*NL*
then
break
out
in
a
distant
rumble
,
so
to
speak
,
in
the
form
of
muttered
*NL*
ejaculations
.
One
of
these
was
,
``
Ai
n't

enough
in
him

show
in
*NL*
his

*NL*
*NL*
Presently
she
muttered
.
``
Yassir
,
enough
to
paint
a
whole
thimbleful
of
*NL*
'em
.
''
At
last
her
ramblings
ceased
altogether
,
and
her
countenance
began
*NL*
to
clear
--
a
welcome
sight
to
Tom
,
who
had
learned
her
moods
,
and
knew
she
*NL*
was
on
the
threshold
of
good
humor
now
.
He
noticed
that
from
time
to
time
*NL*
she
unconsciously
carried
her
finger
to
the
end
of
her
nose
.
He
looked
*NL*
closer
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mammy
,
the
end
of

nose

How
did

*NL*
*NL*
She
sent
out
the
sort
of
wholehearted
peal
of
laughter
which
God
had
*NL*
vouchsafed
in
its
perfection
to
none
but
the
happy
angels
in

and
*NL*
the
bruised
and
broken
black
slave
on

said

What
a
time
of
it
Dawson
's
Landing
was
having
!
All
its
life
it
had
been
*NL*
asleep
,
but
now
it
hardly
got
a
chance
for
a
nod
,
so
swiftly
did
big
*NL*
events
and
crashing
surprises
come
along
in
one
another
's
wake
:
Friday
*NL*
morning
,
first
glimpse
of
Real
Nobility
,
also
grand
reception
at
Aunt
*NL*
Patsy
Cooper
's
,
also
great
robber
raid
;
Friday
evening
,
dramatic
kicking
*NL*
of
the
heir
of
the
chief
citizen
in
presence
of
four
hundred
people
;
*NL*
Saturday
morning
,
emergence
as
practicing
lawyer
of
the
long-submerged
*NL*
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
;
Saturday
night
,
duel
between
chief
citizen
and
titled
*NL*
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
took
more
pride
in
the
duel
than
in
all
the
other
events
put
*NL*
together
,
perhaps
.
It
was
a
glory
to
their
town
to
have
such
a
thing
*NL*
happen
there
.
In
their
eyes
the
principals
had
reached
the
summit
of
*NL*
human
honor
.
Everybody
paid
homage
to
their
names
;
their
praises
were
in
*NL*
all
mouths
.
Even
the
duelists
'
subordinates
came
in
for
a
handsome
share
*NL*
of
the
public
approbation
:
wherefore
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
was
suddenly
*NL*
become
a
man
of
consequence
.
When
asked
to
run
for
the
mayoralty
Saturday
*NL*
night
,
he
was
risking
defeat
,
but
Sunday
morning
found
him
a
made
man
and
*NL*
his
success
assured
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
twins
were
prodigiously
great
now
;
the
town
took
them
to
its
bosom
*NL*
with
enthusiasm
.
Day
after
day
,
and
night
after
night
,
they
went
dining
*NL*
and
visiting
from
house
to
house
,
making
friends
,
enlarging
and
*NL*
solidifying
their
popularity
,
and
charming
and
surprising
all
with
their
*NL*
musical
prodigies
,
and
now
and
then
heightening
the
effects
with
samples
*NL*
of
what
they
could
do
in
other
directions
,
out
of
their
stock
of
rare
and
*NL*
curious
accomplishments
.
They
were
so
pleased
that
they
gave
the
*NL*
regulation
thirty
days
'
notice
,
the
required
preparation
for
citizenship
,
*NL*
and
resolved
to
finish
their
days
in
this
pleasant
place
.
That
was
the
*NL*
climax
.
The
delighted
community
rose
as
one
man
and
applauded
;
and
when
*NL*
the
twins
were
asked
to
stand
for
seats
in
the
forthcoming
aldermanic
*NL*
board
,
and
consented
,
the
public
contentment
was
rounded
and
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Driscoll
was
not
happy
over
these
things
;
they
sunk
deep
,
and
hurt
*NL*
all
the
way
down
.
He
hated
the
one
twin
for
kicking
him
,
and
the
other
*NL*
one
for
being
the
kicker
's
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
and
then
the
people
wondered
why
nothing
was
heard
of
the
raider
,
or
*NL*
of
the
stolen
knife
or
the
other
plunder
,
but
nobody
was
able
to
throw
*NL*
any
light
on
that
matter
.
Nearly
a
week
had
drifted
by
,
and
still
the
*NL*
thing
remained
a
vexed
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sunday
Constable
Blake
and
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
met
on
the
street
,
and
*NL*
Tom
Driscoll
joined
them
in
time
to
open
their
conversation
for
them
.
He
*NL*
said
to
Blake
:
``
You
are
not
looking
well
,
Blake
;
you
seem
to
be
annoyed
*NL*
about
something
.
Has
anything
gone
wrong
in
the
detective
business
?
I
*NL*
believe
you
fairly
and
justifiably
claim
to
have
a
pretty
good
reputation
*NL*
in
that
line
,
is
n't
it
so
?
''
--
which
made
Blake
feel
good
,
and
look
it
;
*NL*
but
Tom
added
,
``
for
a
country
detective
''
--
which
made
Blake
feel
the
other
*NL*
way
,
and
not
only
look
it
,
but
betray
it
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
I
_
have
_
got
a
reputation
;
and
it
's
as
good
as
anybody
's
in
*NL*
the
profession
,
too
,
country
or
no
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
beg
pardon
;
I
did
n't
mean
any
offense
.
What
I
started
out
to
ask
*NL*
was
only
about
the
old
woman
that
raided
the
town
--
the
stoop-shouldered
*NL*
old
woman
,
you
know
,
that
you
said
you
were
going
to
catch
;
and
I
knew
*NL*
you
would
,
too
,
because
you
have
the
reputation
of
never
boasting
,
*NL*
and
--
well
,
you
--
you
've
caught
the
old
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
the
old
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sho
!
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
have
n't
caught
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't
caught
her
.
If
anybody
could
have
caught
her
,
I
could
;
*NL*
but
nobody
could
n't
,
I
do
n't
care
who
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
real
sorry
--
for
your
sake
;
because
,
when
it
gets
around
that
*NL*
a
detective
has
expressed
himself
confidently
,
and
then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
worry
,
that
's
all
--
do
n't
you
worry
;
and
as
for
the
town

the
*NL*
town
need
n't
worry
either
.
She
's
my
meat

make
yourself
easy
about
that

*NL*
I
'm
on
her
track
;
I
've

clues
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
good
!
Now

you
could
get
an
old
veteran
detective
down
from
*NL*
St.
Louis
to
help
you
find
out
what
the
clues
mean
,
and
where
they
lead
*NL*
to
,
and
then

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
plenty
veteran
enough
myself

and
I
do
n't
need
anybody

help

I
'll
*NL*
have
her
inside
of
a
we

inside
of
a
month

That
I
'll
swear
to

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
said
carelessly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
will
answer
--
yes
,
that
will
answer

But
I
reckon
she
is
*NL*
pretty
old
,
and
old
people
do
n't
often
outlive
the
cautious
pace
of
the
*NL*
professional
detective
when
he
has
got
his
clues
together
and
is
out
on
*NL*
his
still-hunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blake
's
dull
face
flushed
under
this
gibe
,
but
before
he
could
set
his
*NL*
retort
in
order
Tom
had
turned
to
Wilson
,
and
was
saying
,
with
placid
*NL*
indifference
of
manner
and
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
got
the
reward
,
Pudd
`
nhead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
winced
slightly
,
and
saw
that
his
own
turn
was
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
reward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
reward
for
the
thief
,
and
the
other
one
for
the
knife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
answered
--
and
rather
uncomfortably
,
to
judge
by
his
hesitating
*NL*
fashion
of
delivering
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
--
well
,
in
face
,
nobody
has
claimed
it
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
seemed
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
is
that
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
showed
a
trifle
of
irritation
when
he
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
so
.
And
what
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
.
Only
I
thought
you
had
struck
out
a
new
idea
,
and
invented
*NL*
a
scheme

was
going
to
revolutionize
the
timeworn
and
ineffectual

He
stopped
,
and
turned
to
Blake
,
who
was
happy
now
*NL*
that
another
had
taken
his
place
on
the
gridiron
.
``
Blake
,
did
n't
you
*NL*
understand
him
to
intimate
that
it
would
n't
be
necessary
for
you
to
hunt
*NL*
the
old
woman
down
?

''
`
B'George
,
he
said
he
'd
have
thief
and
swag
both
inside
of
three
days
*NL*
--
he
did
,
by
hokey
!
and
that
's
just
about
a
week
ago
.
Why
,
I
said
at
the
*NL*
time
that
no
thief
and
no
thief
's
pal
was
going
to
try
to
pawn
or
sell
a
*NL*
thing
where
he
knowed
the
pawnbroker
could
get
both
rewards
by
taking
HIM
*NL*
into
camp
_
with

the
swag
.
It
was
the
blessedest
idea
that
ever
I
*NL*
struck
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
change
your
mind

said
Wilson
,
with
irritated
bluntness
,
``
if
you
*NL*
knew
the
entire
scheme
instead
of
only
part
of
it

``
Well

said
the
constable

pensively
,
``
I
had
the
idea

up

*NL*
``
Very

anything

back
with
,
so
he
discharged
a
*NL*
discontented
sniff
,
and
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
night
that
Wilson
had
partly
revealed
his
scheme
at
his
house
,
*NL*
Tom
had
tried
for
several
days
to
guess
out
the
secret
of
the
rest
of
it
,
*NL*
but
had
failed
.
Then
it
occurred
to
him
to
give
Roxana
's
smarter
head
a
*NL*
chance
at
it
.
He
made
up
a
supposititious
case
,
and
laid
it
before
*NL*
her
.
She
thought
it
over
,
and
delivered
her
verdict
upon
it
.
Tom
said
*NL*
to
himself
,
``
She
's
hit
it
,
sure
!
''
He
thought
he
would
test
that
verdict
*NL*
now
,
and
watch
Wilson
's
face
;
so
he
said
reflectively
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wilson
,
you
're
not
a
fool
--
a
fact
of
recent
discovery
.
Whatever
your
*NL*
scheme
was
,
it
had
sense
in
it
,
Blake
's
opinion
to
the
contrary
*NL*
notwithstanding
.
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
reveal
it
,
but
I
will
suppose
a
*NL*
case
--
a
case
which
you
will
answer
as
a
starting
point
for
the
real
thing
*NL*
I
am
going
to
come
at
,
and
that
's
all
I
want
.
You
offered
five
hundred
*NL*
dollars
for
the
knife
,
and
five
hundred
for
the
thief
.
We
will
suppose
,
*NL*
for
argument
's
sake
,
that
the
first
reward
is
_
advertised
_
and
the
second
*NL*
offered
by
_
private
letter
_
to
pawnbrokers
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blake
slapped
his
thigh
,
and
cried
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jackson
,
he
's
got
you
,
Pudd
`
nhead
!
Now
why
could
n't
I
or
_
any
_
fool
*NL*
have
thought
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
said
to
himself
,
``
Anybody
with
a
reasonably
good
head
would
have
*NL*
thought
of
it
.
I
am
not
surprised
that
Blake
did
n't
detect
it
;
I
am
only
*NL*
surprised
that
Tom
did
.
There
is
more
to
him
than
I
supposed
.
''
He
said
*NL*
nothing
aloud
,
and
Tom
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
The
thief
would
not
suspect
that
there
was
a
trap
,
and
he
*NL*
would
bring
or
send
the
knife
,
and
say
he
bought
it
for
a
song
,
or
found
*NL*
it
in
the
road
,
or
something
like
that
,
and
try
to
collect
the
reward
,
*NL*
and
be
arrested
--
would
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Wilson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
There
ca
n't
be
any
doubt
of
it
.
Have
you
ever
*NL*
seen
that
knife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
any
friend
of
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
I
know
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
begin
to
think
I
understand
why
your
scheme
failed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
Tom
?
What
are
you
driving
at
?
''
asked
Wilson
,
with
a
*NL*
dawning
sense
of
discomfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
there
_
is
n't
_
any
such
knife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Wilson
,
''
said
Blake
,
``
Tom
Driscoll
's
right
,
for
a
thousand
*NL*
dollars
--
if
I
had
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
's
blood
warmed
a
little
,
and
he
wondered
if
he
had
been
played
*NL*
upon
by
those
strangers
;
it
certainly
had
something
of
that
look
.
But
*NL*
what
could
they
gain
by
it
?
He
threw
out
that
suggestion
.
Tom
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gain
?
Oh
,
nothing
that
you
would
value
,
maybe
.
But
they
are
strangers
*NL*
making
their
way
in
a
new
community
.
Is
it
nothing
to
them
to
appear
as
*NL*
pets
of
an
Oriental
prince
--
at
no
expense
?
Is
it
nothing
to
them
to
be
*NL*
able
to
dazzle
this
poor
town
with
thousand-dollar
rewards
--
at
no
*NL*
expense
?
Wilson
,
there
is
n't
any
such
knife
,
or
your
scheme
would
have
*NL*
fetched
it
to
light
.
Or
if
there
is
any
such
knife
,
they
've
got
it
yet
.
*NL*
I
believe
,
myself
,
that
they
've
seen
such
a
knife
,
for
Angelo
pictured
it
*NL*
out
with
his
pencil
too
swiftly
and
handily
for
him
to
have
been
*NL*
inventing
it
,
and
of
course
I
ca
n't
swear
that
they
've
never
had
it
;
but
*NL*
this
I
'll
go
bail
for
--
if
they
had
it
when
they
came
to
this
town
,
*NL*
they
've
got
it
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blake
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
mighty
reasonable
,
the
way
Tom
puts
it
;
it
most
certainly
*NL*
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
responded
,
turning
to
leave
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
find
the
old
woman
,
Blake
,
and
if
she
ca
n't
furnish
the
knife
,
go
*NL*
and
search
the
twins
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
sauntered
away
.
Wilson
felt
a
good
deal
depressed
.
He
hardly
knew
*NL*
what
to
think
.
He
was
loath
to
withdraw
his
faith
from
the
twins
,
and
*NL*
was
resolved
not
to
do
it
on
the
present
indecisive
evidence
;
but
--
well
,
*NL*
he
would
think
,
and
then
decide
how
to
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blake
,
what
do
you
think
of
this
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Pudd
`
nhead
,
I
'm
bound
to
say
I
put
it
up
the
way
Tom
does
.
They
*NL*
had
n't
the
knife
;
or
if
they
had
it
,
they
've
got
it
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
parted
.
Wilson
said
to
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
they
had
it
;
if
it
had
been
stolen
,
the
scheme
would
have
*NL*
restored
it
,
that
is
certain
.
And
so
I
believe
they
've
got
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
no
purpose
in
his
mind
when
he
encountered
those
two
men
.
When
he
*NL*
began
his
talk
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
gall
them
a
little
and
get
a
trifle
*NL*
of
malicious
entertainment
out
of
it
.
But
when
he
left
,
he
left
in
great
*NL*
spirits
,
for
he
perceived
that
just
by
pure
luck
and
no
troublesome
labor
*NL*
he
had
accomplished
several
delightful
things
:
he
had
touched
both
men
*NL*
on
a
raw
spot
and
seen
them
squirm
;
he
had
modified
Wilson
's
sweetness
*NL*
for
the
twins
with
one
small
bitter
taste
that
he
would
n't
be
able
to
get
*NL*
out
of
his
mouth
right
away
;
and
,
best
of
all
,
he
had
taken
the
hated
*NL*
twins
down
a
peg
with
the
community
;
for
Blake
would
gossip
around
*NL*
freely
,
after
the
manner
of
detectives
,
and
within
a
week
the
town
would
*NL*
be
laughing
at
them
in
its
sleeve
for
offering
a
gaudy
reward
for
a
*NL*
bauble
which
they
either
never
possessed
or
had
n't
lost
.
Tom
was
very
*NL*
well
satisfied
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
behavior
at
home
had
been
perfect
during
the
entire
week
.
His
uncle
*NL*
and
aunt
had
seen
nothing
like
it
before
.
They
could
find
no
fault
with
*NL*
him
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Saturday
evening
he
said
to
the
Judge
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
something
preying
on
my
mind
,
uncle
,
and
as
I
am
going
away
,
*NL*
and
might
never
see
you
again
,
I
ca
n't
bear
it
any
longer
.
I
made
you
*NL*
believe
I
was
afraid
to
fight
that
Italian
adventurer
.
I
had
to
get
out
*NL*
of
it
on
some
pretext
or
other
,
and
maybe
I
chose
badly
,
being
taken
*NL*
unawares
,
but
no
honorable
person
could
consent
to
meet
him
in
the
field
,
*NL*
knowing
what
I
knew
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
What
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Luigi
is
a
confessed
assassin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Incredible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
perfectly
true
.
Wilson
detected
it
in
his
hand
,
by
palmistry
,
and
*NL*
charged
him
with
it
,
and
cornered
him
up
so
close
that
he
had
to
confess
;
*NL*
but
both
twins
begged
us
on
their
knees
to
keep
the
secret
,
and
swore
*NL*
they
would
lead
straight
lives
here
;
and
it
was
all
so
pitiful
that
we
*NL*
gave
our
word
of
honor
never
to
expose
them
while
they
kept
the
promise
.
*NL*
You
would
have
done
it
yourself
,
uncle

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right

my
boy

I
would

A
man

secret
is
still
his
own

property

sacred

it
has
been
surprised
out
of
him
like
that
.
*NL*
You
did
well
,
and
I
am
proud
of
you
.
''
Then
he
added
mournfully
,
``
But
I
*NL*
wish
I
could
have
been
saved
the
shame
of
meeting
an
assassin

the

honor

*NL*
``
It

If

I
should
have
felt
obliged
to
sacrifice
my
pledged
word
in

to
stop
it

Wilson
could
n't
be
expected
to
do
otherwise

keep
silent

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Wilson
did
right

and
is
in
no
way
to
blame

Tom

Tom
,
you
have
*NL*
lifted
a
heavy
load
from
my
heart
;
I
was
stung
to
the
very
soul
when
I
*NL*
seemed
to
have
discovered
that
I
had
a
coward
in
my
family

*NL*
*NL*

You

imagine

it
cost

``
Oh

I
can
understand

has
cost
you
to
remain
under
that
unjust
stigma
to
this
time

But
it
is
*NL*
all
right
now

and
no
harm
is
done

You

restored

mind

with
it
your

*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
sat
awhile
plunged
in
thought
;
then
he
looked
up
with
a
*NL*
satisfied
light
in
his
eye
,
and
said
:
``

he
were
a

a
matter
which
I
will
presently
settle

but
not
*NL*
now

I
will
not
shoot
him
until
after
election

I
see
a
way
to
ruin
them

both
before

I
will
attend
to
that
first
.
Neither

them
shall
be

elected

that
I
promise
.
You
are
sure
that
the
fact
that
he
is
an
*NL*
assassin
has
not
got
abroad

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
certain
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
a
good
card

I
will
fling
a
hint
at

day

*NL*
*NL*
Another
point
scored
against
the
detested
twins
!
Really
it
was
a
great
*NL*
day
for
Tom
.
He
was
encouraged
to
chance
a
parting
shot
,
now
,
at
the
*NL*
same
target
,
and
did
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

wonderful
Indian
knife

such
a

Well

there
's
no
track
or
trace
of
it
yet

so
the
*NL*
town
is
beginning
to
sneer

gossip

laugh

Half
the

never

half
believe

talking

*NL*
*NL*
Yes

Tom
's
blemishless
week
had
restored
him
to
the
favor
of
his
aunt
and
*NL*
uncle

*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
was
satisfied
with
him

too

Privately
,
she
believed
she
was
*NL*
coming
to
love
him
,
but
she
did
not
say
so
.
She
told
him
to
go
along
to
*NL*
St.
Louis
now
,
and
she
would
get
ready
and
follow
.
Then
she
smashed
her
*NL*
whisky
bottle
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dah

*NL*
Tom
went
aboard
one
of
the
big
transient
boats
that
night
with
his
heavy
*NL*
satchel
of
miscellaneous
plunder
,
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
unjust
,
*NL*
which
is
serener
and
sounder
than
the
other
kind
,
as
we
know
by
the

hanging-eve
history
of
a
million
rascals

But
when
he
got
up
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
luck
was
against
him
again
:
a
brother
thief
had
robbed
him
while

slept

gone
ashore

If

we

When
Roxana
arrived
,
she
found
her
son
in
such
despair
and
misery
that
*NL*
her
heart
was
touched
and
her
motherhood
rose
up
strong
in
her
.
He
was
*NL*
ruined
past
hope
now
;
his
destruction
would
be
immediate
and
sure
,
and
he
*NL*
would
be
an
outcast
and
friendless
.
That
was
reason
enough
for
a
mother
*NL*
to
love
a
child
;
so
she
loved
him
,
and
told
him
so
.
It
made
him
wince
,
*NL*
secretly
--
for
she
was
a
``
nigger
.
''
That
he
was
one
himself
was
far
from
*NL*
reconciling
him
to
that
despised
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
Roxana
poured
out
endearments
upon
him
,
to
which
he
responded
*NL*
uncomfortably
,
but
as
well
as
he
could
.
And
she
tried
to
comfort
him
,
but
*NL*
that
was
not
possible
.
These
intimacies
quickly
became
horrible
to
him
,
*NL*
and
within
the
hour
he
began
to
try
to
get
up
courage
enough
to
tell
her
*NL*
so
,
and
require
that
they
be
discontinued
or
very
considerably
modified
.
*NL*
But
he
was
afraid
of
her
;
and
besides
,
there
came
a
lull
now
,
for
she
had
*NL*
begun
to
think
.
She
was
trying
to
invent
a
saving
plan
.
Finally
she
*NL*
started
up
,
and
said
she
had
found
a
way
out
.
Tom
was
almost
suffocated
*NL*
by
the
joy
of
this
sudden
good
news
.
Roxana
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
Tom
was
dazed
.
He
was
not
sure
he
had
heard
aright
.
He
was
dumb
for
a
*NL*
moment
;
then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
forged
a
bill
of
sale
and
sold
his
mother
to
an
Arkansas
cotton
*NL*
planter
for
a
trifle
over
six
hundred
dollars
.
He
did
not
want
to
commit
*NL*
this
treachery
,
but
luck
threw
the
man
in
his
way
,
and
this
saved
him
the
*NL*
necessity
of
going
up-country
to
hunt
up
a
purchaser
,
with
the
added
risk
*NL*
of
having
to
answer
a
lot
of
questions
,
whereas
this
planter
was
so
*NL*
pleased
with
Roxy
that
he
asked
next
to
none
at
all
.
Besides
,
the
*NL*
planter
insisted
that
Roxy
would
n't
know
where
she
was
,
at
first
,
and
*NL*
that
by
the
time
she
found
out
she
would
already
have
been
contented
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Tom
argued
with
himself
that
it
was
an
immense
advantaged
for
Roxy
to
*NL*
have
a
master
who
was
pleased
with
her
,
as
this
planter
manifestly
was
.
*NL*
In
almost
no
time
his
flowing
reasonings
carried
him
to
the
point
of
even
*NL*
half
believing
he
was
doing
Roxy
a
splendid
surreptitious
service
in
*NL*
selling
her
``
down
the
river
.
''
And
then
he
kept
diligently
saying
to
*NL*
himself
all
the
time
:
``
It
's
for
only
a
year
.
In
a
year
I
buy
her
free
*NL*
again
;
she
'll
keep
that
in
mind
,
and
it
'll
reconcile
her
.
''
Yes
;
the
*NL*
little
deception
could
do
no
harm
,
and
everything
would
come
out
right
*NL*
and
pleasant
in
the
end
,
anyway
.
By
agreement
,
the
conversation
in
*NL*
Roxy
's
presence
was
all
about
the
man
's
``
up-country
''
farm
,
and
how
*NL*
pleasant
a
place
it
was
,
and
how
happy
the
slaves
were
there
;
so
poor
*NL*
Roxy
was
entirely
deceived
;
and
easily
,
for
she
was
not
dreaming
that
her
*NL*
own
son
could
be
guilty
of
treason
to
a
mother
who
,
in
voluntarily
going
*NL*
into
slavery
--
slavery
of
any
kind
,
mild
or
severe
,
or
of
any
duration
,
*NL*
brief
or
long
--
was
making
a
sacrifice
for
him
compared
with
which
death
*NL*
would
have
been
a
poor
and
commonplace
one
.
She
lavished
tears
and
*NL*
loving
caresses
upon
him
privately
,
and
then
went
away
with
her
owner
*NL*
--
went
away
brokenhearted
,
and
yet
proud
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
scored
his
accounts
,
and
resolved
to
keep
to
the
very
letter
of
his
*NL*
reform
,
and
never
to
put
that
will
in
jeopardy
again
.
He
had
three
*NL*
hundred
dollars
left
.
According
to
his
mother
's
plan
,
he
was
to
put
that
*NL*
safely
away
,
and
add
her
half
of
his
pension
to
it
monthly
.
In
one
year
*NL*
this
fund
would
buy
her
free
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
whole
week
he
was
not
able
to
sleep
well
,
so
much
the
villainy
*NL*
which
he
had
played
upon
his
trusting
mother
preyed
upon
his
rag
of
*NL*
conscience
;
but
after
that
he
began
to
get
comfortable
again
,
and
was
*NL*
presently
able
to
sleep
like
any
other
miscreant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boat
bore
Roxy
away
from
St.
Louis
at
four
in
the
afternoon
,
and
she
*NL*
stood
on
the
lower
guard
abaft
the
paddle
box
and
watched
Tom
through
a
*NL*
blur
of
tears
until
he
melted
into
the
throng
of
people
and
disappeared
;
*NL*
then
she
looked
no
more
,
but
sat
there
on
a
coil
of
cable
crying
till
far
*NL*
into
the
night
.
When
she
went
to
her
foul
steerage
bunk
at
last
,
between
*NL*
the
clashing
engines
,
it
was
not
to
sleep
,
but
only
to
wait
for
the
*NL*
morning
,
and
,
waiting
,
grieve
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
imagined
that
she
``
would
not
know
,
''
and
would
think
she
was
*NL*
traveling
upstream
.
She
!
Why
,
she
had
been
steamboating
for
years
.
At
*NL*
dawn
she
got
up
and
went
listlessly
and
sat
down
on
the
cable
coil
again
.
*NL*
She
passed
many
a
snag
whose
``
break
''
could
have
told
her
a
thing
to
break
*NL*
her
heart
,
for
it
showed
a
current
moving
in
the
same
direction
that
the
*NL*
boat
was
going
;
but
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere
,
and
she
did
not
notice
.
*NL*
But
at
last
the
roar
of
a
bigger
and
nearer
break
than
usual
brought
her
*NL*
out
of
her
torpor
,
and
she
looked
up
,
and
her
practiced
eye
fell
upon
*NL*
that
telltale
rush
of
water
.
For
one
moment
her
petrified
gaze
fixed
*NL*
itself
there
.
Then
her
head
dropped
upon
her
breast
,
and
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
The
summer
weeks
dragged
by
,
and
then
the
political
campaign
opened
*NL*
--
opened
in
pretty
warm
fashion
,
and
waxed
hotter
and
hotter
daily
.
The
*NL*
twins
threw
themselves
into
it
with
their
whole
heart
,
for
their
*NL*
self-love
was
engaged
.
Their
popularity
,
so
general
at
first
,
had
*NL*
suffered
afterward
;
mainly
because
they
had
been
TOO
popular
,
and
so
a
*NL*
natural
reaction
had
followed
.
Besides
,
it
had
been
diligently
whispered
*NL*
around
that
it
was
curious
--
indeed
,
VERY
curious
--
that
that
wonderful
*NL*
knife
of
theirs
did
not
turn
up
--
IF
it
was
so
valuable
,
or
IF
it
had
ever
*NL*
existed
.
And
with
the
whisperings
went
chucklings
and
nudgings
and
winks
,
*NL*
and
such
things
have
an
effect
.
The
twins
considered
that
success
in
the
*NL*
election
would
reinstate
them
,
and
that
defeat
would
work
them
*NL*
irreparable
damage
.
Therefore
they
worked
hard
,
but
not
harder
than
*NL*
Judge
Driscoll
and
Tom
worked
against
them
in
the
closing
days
of
the
*NL*
canvass
.
Tom
's
conduct
had
remained
so
letter-perfect
during
two
whole
*NL*
months
now
,
that
his
uncle
not
only
trusted
him
with
money
with
which
to
*NL*
persuade
voters
,
but
trusted
him
to
go
and
get
it
himself
out
of
the
safe
*NL*
in
the
private
sitting
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
closing
speech
of
the
campaign
was
made
by
Judge
Driscoll
,
and
he
*NL*
made
it
against
both
of
the
foreigners
.
It
was
disastrously
effective
.
*NL*
He
poured
out
rivers
of
ridicule
upon
them
,
and
forced
the
big
mass
*NL*
meeting
to
laugh
and
applaud
.
He
scoffed
at
them
as
adventurers
,
*NL*
mountebanks
,
sideshow
riffraff
,
dime
museum
freaks
;
he
assailed
their
*NL*
showy
titles
with
measureless
derision
;
he
said
they
were
back-alley
*NL*
barbers
disguised
as
nobilities
,
peanut
peddlers
masquerading
as
*NL*
gentlemen
,
organ-grinders
bereft
of
their
brother
monkey
.
At
last
he
*NL*
stopped
and
stood
still
.
He
waited
until
the
place
had
become
absolutely
*NL*
silent
and
expectant
,
then
he
delivered
his
deadliest
shot
;
delivered
it
*NL*
with
ice-cold
seriousness
and
deliberation
,
with
a
significant
emphasis
*NL*
upon
the
closing
words
:
he
said
he
believed
that
the
reward
offered
for
*NL*
the
lost
knife
was
humbug
and
bunkum
,
and
that
its
owner
would
know
where
*NL*
to
find
it
whenever
he
should
have
occasion
TO
ASSASSINATE
SOMEBODY
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
stepped
from
the
stand
,
leaving
a
startled
and
impressive
hush
*NL*
behind
him
instead
of
the
customary
explosion
of
cheers
and
party
cries
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strange
remark
flew
far
and
wide
over
the
town
and
made
an
*NL*
extraordinary
sensation
.
Everybody
was
asking
,
``
What
could
he
mean
by
*NL*
that
?
''
And
everybody
went
on
asking
that
question
,
but
in
vain
;
for
the
*NL*
judge
only
said
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
,
and
stopped
there
;
Tom
*NL*
said
he
had
n't
any
idea
what
his
uncle
meant
,
and
Wilson
,
whenever
he
was
*NL*
asked
what
he
thought
it
meant
,
parried
the
question
by
asking
the
*NL*
questioner
what
HE
thought
it
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
was
elected
,
the
twins
were
defeated
--
crushed
,
in
fact
,
and
left
*NL*
forlorn
and
substantially
friendless
.
Tom
went
back
to
St.
Louis
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawson
's
Landing
had
a
week
of
repose
now
,
and
it
needed
it
.
But
it
was
*NL*
in
an
expectant
state
,
for
the
air
was
full
of
rumors
of
a
new
duel
.
*NL*
Judge
Driscoll
's
election
labors
had
prostrated
him
,
but
it
was
said
that
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
was
well
enough
to
entertain
a
challenge
he
would
get
one
*NL*
from
Count
Luigi
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brothers
withdrew
entirely
from
society
,
and
nursed
their
humiliation
*NL*
in
privacy
.
They
avoided
the
people
,
and
went
out
for
exercise
only
late
*NL*
at
night
,
when
the
streets
were
deserted

THANKSGIVING
DAY
.
Let
us
all
give
humble
,
hearty
,
and
*NL*
sincere
thanks
now
,
but
the
turkeys
.
In
the
island
of
Fiji
*NL*
they
do
not
use
turkeys
;
they
use
plumbers
.
It
does
not
*NL*
become
you
and
me
to
sneer
at
Fiji
.

The
Friday
after
the
election
was
a
rainy
one
in
St.
Louis
.
It
rained
*NL*
all
day
long
,
and
rained
hard
,
apparently
trying
its
best
to
wash
that
*NL*
soot-blackened
town
white
,
but
of
course
not
succeeding
.
Toward
midnight
*NL*
Tom
Driscoll
arrived
at
his
lodgings
from
the
theater
in
the
heavy
*NL*
downpour
,
and
closed
his
umbrella
and
let
himself
in
;
but
when
he
would
*NL*
have
shut
the
door
,
he
found
that
there
was
another
person
*NL*
entering
--
doubtless
another
lodger
;
this
person
closed
the
door
and
*NL*
tramped
upstairs
behind
Tom
.
Tom
found
his
door
in
the
dark
,
and
entered
*NL*
it
,
and
turned
up
the
gas
.
When
he
faced
about
,
lightly
whistling
,
he
*NL*
saw
the
back
of
a
man
.
The
man
was
closing
and
locking
his
door
from
*NL*
him
.
His
whistle
faded
out
and
he
felt
uneasy
.
The
man
turned
around
,
a
*NL*
wreck
of
shabby
old
clothes
,
sodden
with
rain
and
all
a-drip
,
and
showed
*NL*
a
black
face
under
an
old
slouch
hat
.
Tom
was
frightened
.
He
tried
to
*NL*
order
the
man
out
,
but
the
words
refused
to
come
,
and
the
other
man
got
*NL*
the
start
.
He
said
,
in
a
low
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
still
--
I
's
yo
'
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
sunk
in
a
heap
on
a
chair
,
and
gasped
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
mean
of
me
,
and
base
--
I
know
it
;
but
I
meant
it
for
the
best
,
I
*NL*
did
indeed
--
I
can
swear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Roxana
stood
awhile
looking
mutely
down
on
him
while
he
writhed
in
shame
*NL*
and
went
on
incoherently
babbling
self-accusations
mixed
with
pitiful
*NL*
attempts
at
explanation
and
palliation
of
his
crime
;
then
she
seated
*NL*
herself
and
took
off
her
hat
,
and
her
unkept
masses
of
long
brown
hair
*NL*
tumbled
down
about
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
war
n't
no
fault
o
'
yo
'n
dat
dat
ai
n't
gray
,
''
she
said
sadly
,
noticing
*NL*
the
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
I
know
it
!
I
'm
a
scoundrel
.
But
I
swear
I
meant
it
for
the
*NL*
best
.
It
was
a
mistake
,
of
course
,
but
I
thought
it
was
for
the
best
,
I
*NL*
truly
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Roxana
began
to
cry
softly
,
and
presently
words
began
to
find
their
way
*NL*
out
between
her
sobs
.
They
were
uttered
lamentingly
,
rather
than
*NL*
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sell
a
pusson
down
de
river
--
DOWN
DE
RIVER
!
--
for
de
bes
'
!
I
would
n't
*NL*
treat
a
dog
so
!
I
is
all
broke
down
en
wore
out
now
,
en
so
I
reckon
*NL*
it
ai
n't
in
me
to
storm
aroun
'
no
mo
'
,
like
I
used
to
when
I
`
uz
trompled
*NL*
on
en
`
bused
.
I
do
n't
know
--
but
maybe
it
's
so
.
Leastways
,
I
's
suffered
*NL*
so
much
dat
mournin
'
seem
to
come
mo
'
handy
to
me
now
den
stormin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
should
have
touched
Tom
Driscoll
,
but
if
they
did
,
that
*NL*
effect
was
obliterated
by
a
stronger
one
--
one
which
removed
the
heavy
*NL*
weight
of
fear
which
lay
upon
him
,
and
gave
his
crushed
spirit
a
most
*NL*
grateful
rebound
,
and
filled
all
his
small
soul
with
a
deep
sense
of
*NL*
relief
.
But
he
kept
prudently
still
,
and
ventured
no
comment
.
There
was
*NL*
a
voiceless
interval
of
some
duration
now
,
in
which
no
sounds
were
heard
*NL*
but
the
beating
of
the
rain
upon
the
panes
,
the
sighing
and
complaining
*NL*
of
the
winds
,
and
now
and
then
a
muffled
sob
from
Roxana
.
The
sobs
became
*NL*
more
and
more
infrequent
,
and
at
last
ceased
.
Then
the
refugee
began
to
*NL*
talk
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shet

Dat

dat

he

as

en

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
heart
was
fired
--
with
fury
against
the
planter
's
wife
;
and
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
,
``
But
for
that
meddlesome
fool
,
everything
would
have
gone
all
*NL*
right
.
''
He
added
a
deep
and
bitter
curse
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
expression
of
this
sentiment
was
fiercely
written
in
his
face
,
and
*NL*
stood
thus
revealed
to
Roxana
by
a
white
glare
of
lightning
which
turned
*NL*
the
somber
dusk
of
the
room
into
dazzling
day
at
that
moment
.
She
was
*NL*
pleased
--
pleased
and
grateful
;
for
did
not
that
expression
show
that
her
*NL*
child
was
capable
of
grieving
for
his
mother
's
wrongs
and
of
feeling
*NL*
resentment
toward
her
persecutors
?
--
a
thing
which
she
had
been
doubting
.
*NL*
But
her
flash
of
happiness
was
only
a
flash
,
and
went
out
again
and
left
*NL*
her
spirit
dark
;
for
she
said
to
herself
,
``
He
sole
me
down
de
river
--
he
*NL*
ca
n't
feel
for
a
body
long
;
dis
'll

Then
she
took
up
her
tale
*NL*
again
.

*NL*
Tom
had
been
gradually
sinking
into
a
state
of
ghastly
terror
,
and
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
,
now
:
``
I
'm
lost
,
no
matter
what
turn
things
take
!
This
*NL*
man
has
said
to
me
that
he
thinks
there
was
something
suspicious
about
*NL*
that
sale
;
he
said
he
had
a
letter
from
a
passenger
on
the
GRAND
MOGUL
*NL*
saying
that
Roxy
came
here
on
that
boat
and
that
everybody
on
board
knew
*NL*
all
about
the
case
;
so
he
says
that
her
coming
here
instead
of
flying
to
*NL*
a
free
state
looks
bad
for
me
,
and
that
if
I
do
n't
find
her
for
him
,
and
*NL*
that
pretty
soon
,
he
will
make
trouble
for
me
.
I
never
believed
that
*NL*
story
;
I
could
n't
believe
she
would
be
so
dead
to
all
motherly
instincts
*NL*
as
to
come
here
,
knowing
the
risk
she
would
run
of
getting
me
into
*NL*
irremediable
trouble
.
And
after
all
,
here
she
is
!
And
I
stupidly
swore
*NL*
I
would
help
find
her
,
thinking
it
was
a
perfectly
safe
thing
to
promise
.
*NL*
If
I
venture
to
deliver
her
up
,
she
--
she
--
but
how
can
I
help
myself
?
*NL*
I
've
got
to
do
that
or
pay
the
money
,
and
where
's
the
money
to
come
from
?
*NL*
I
--
I
--
well
,
I
should
think
that
if
he
would
swear
to
treat
her
kindly
*NL*
hereafter
--
and
she
says
,
herself
,
that
he
is
a
good
man
--
and
if
he
would
*NL*
swear
to
never
allow
her
to
be
overworked

ill
fed

*NL*
*NL*
A
flash
of
lightning
exposed
Tom
's
pallid
face
,
drawn
and
rigid
with
*NL*
these
worrying
thoughts
.
Roxana
spoke
up
sharply
now
,
and
there
was
*NL*
apprehension
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``

He
took
it
out
of
his

.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
panting
with
excitement
,
and
there
was
a
dusky
glow
in
her
eyes
*NL*
that
Tom
could
not
translate
with
certainty
,
but
there
seemed
to
be
*NL*
something
threatening
about
it
.
The
handbill
had
the
usual
rude
woodcut
*NL*
of
a
turbaned
Negro
woman
running
,
with
the
customary
bundle
on
a
stick
*NL*
over
her
shoulder
,
and
the
heading
in
bold
type
,
``
$
100
REWARD

Tom
read
*NL*
the
bill
aloud
--
at
least
the
part
that
described
Roxana
and
named
the
*NL*
master
and
his
St.
Louis
address
and
the
address
of
the
Fourth
street
*NL*
agency
;
but
he
left
out
the
item
that
applicants
for
the
reward
might
*NL*
also
apply
to
Mr.
Thomas
Driscoll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gim

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
folded
it
and
was
putting
it
in
his
pocket
.
He
felt
a
chilly
*NL*
streak
creeping
down
his
back
,
but
said
as
carelessly
as
he
could
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gim

Tom
gave
it
to
her
,
but
with
a
reluctance
which
he
*NL*
could
not
entirely
disguise
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
did
it

Roxana
put
the
bill
carefully
away
in
her
pocket
,
with
her
*NL*
eyes
fixed
upon
Tom
's
face
all
the
while

then
she
said

``

Tom
cursed
himself
for
making
that
stupid
blunder
,
and
tried
to
rectify
*NL*
it
by
saying
he
remembered
now
that
it
WAS
at
noon
Monday

*NL*
gave

recognized

in

vise

with

screw
turned

out

*NL*
was
no
budging

His
face
began
to
take
on
an
ugly
look

presently
he
*NL*
said

with
a
snarl
:

*NL*
Roxy
scorched
him
with
a
scornful
gaze
awhile

then

said

spat
on

made
no

resent

Roxy
reflected
a

Tom
rose
,
trembling
and
excited
,
and
there
was
an
evil
light
in
his
eye

*NL*
He
strode
to
the
door
and
said
he
must
get
out
of
this
suffocating
place
*NL*
for
a
moment
and
clear
his
brain
in
the
fresh
air
so
that
he
could
*NL*
determine
what
to
do

The
door
would
n't
open

Roxy
smiled
grimly
,
and

said
:

*NL*
sat
down
and
began
to
pass
his
hands
through
his
hair
with
a
helpless
and
*NL*
desperate
air

Roxy
said
,
``

Tom
glanced
up
with

*NL*
*NL*
They
were
not

Tom
trembled
every
time
a
late
straggler
brushed
*NL*
by
them
on
the
street
,
and
half
expected
to
feel
the
cold

in

Roxy
was
right
at

and
always
in
reach
.
After
tramping
a

mile
they
reached
a
wide

on

deserted

in
this

dark
and
rainy
desert
they
parted

*NL*
*NL*
As
Tom
trudged
home
his

was
full
of
dreary

wild

at

he
said
to
himself

wearily
:

The
Prophesy
Realized

Few
things
are
harder
to
put
up

than
the
annoyance
of
*NL*
a
good

_

Pudd
`
nhead
*NL*
Wilson
's
Calendar
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dawson
's
Landing
was
comfortably
finishing
its
season
of
dull
repose
and
*NL*
waiting
patiently
for
the
duel
.
Count
Luigi
was
waiting
,
too
;
but
not
*NL*
patiently
,
rumor
said
.
Sunday
came
,
and
Luigi
insisted
on
having
his
*NL*
challenge
conveyed
.
Wilson
carried
it
.
Judge
Driscoll
declined
to
fight
*NL*
with
an
assassin
--
``
that
is
,
''
he
added
significantly
,
``
in
the
field
of
*NL*
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elsewhere
,
of
course
,
he
would
be
ready
.
Wilson
tried
to
convince
him
*NL*
that
if
he
had
been
present
himself
when
Angelo
told
him
about
the
*NL*
homicide
committed
by
Luigi
,
he
would
not
have
considered
the
act
*NL*
discreditable
to
Luigi
;
but
the
obstinate
old
man
was
not
to
be
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
went
back
to
his
principal
and
reported
the
failure
of
his
*NL*
mission
.
Luigi
was
incensed
,
and
asked
how
it
could
be
that
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
who
was
by
no
means
dull-witted
,
held
his
trifling
nephew
's
*NL*
evidence
in
inferences
to
be
of
more
value
than
Wilson
's
.
But
Wilson
*NL*
laughed
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
quite
simple
;
that
is
easily
explicable
.
I
am
not
his
doll
--
his
*NL*
baby
--
his
infatuation
:
his
nature
is
.
The
judge
and
his
late
wife
never
*NL*
had
any
children
.
The
judge
and
his
wife
were
past
middle
age
when
this
*NL*
treasure
fell
into
their
lap
.
One
must
make
allowances
for
a
parental
*NL*
instinct
that
has
been
starving
for
twenty-five
or
thirty
years
.
It
is
*NL*
famished
,
it
is
crazed
with
hunger
by
that
time
,
and
will
be
entirely
*NL*
satisfied
with
anything
that
comes
handy
;
its
taste
is
atrophied
,
it
*NL*
ca
n't
tell
mud
cat
from
shad
.
A
devil
born
to
a
young
couple
is
*NL*
measurably
recognizable
by
them
as
a
devil
before
long
,
but
a
devil
*NL*
adopted
by
an
old
couple
is
an
angel
to
them
,
and
remains
so
,
through
*NL*
thick
and
thin
.
Tom
is
this
old
man
's
angel
;
he
is
infatuated
with
him
.
*NL*
Tom
can
persuade
him
into
things
which
other
people
ca
n't
--
not
all
*NL*
things
;
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
but
a
good
many
--
particularly
one
class
of
*NL*
things
:
the
things
that
create
or
abolish
personal
partialities
or
*NL*
prejudices
in
the
old
man
's
mind
.
The
old
man
liked
both
of
you
.
Tom
*NL*
conceived
a
hatred
for
you
.
That
was
enough
;
it
turned
the
old
man
*NL*
around
at
once
.
The
oldest
and
strongest
friendship
must
go
to
the
ground
*NL*
when
one
of
these
late-adopted
darlings
throws
a
brick
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
curious
philosophy
,
''
said
Luigi
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
philosophy
at
all
--
it
's
a
fact
.
And
there
is
something
*NL*
pathetic
and
beautiful
about
it
,
too
.
I
think
there
is
nothing
more
*NL*
pathetic
than
to
see
one
of
these
poor
old
childless
couples
taking
a
*NL*
menagerie
of
yelping
little
worthless
dogs
to
their
hearts
;
and
then
*NL*
adding
some
cursing
and
squawking
parrots
and
a
jackass-voiced
macaw
;
and
*NL*
next
a
couple
of
hundred
screeching
songbirds
,
and
presently
some
fetid
*NL*
guinea
pigs
and
rabbits
,
and
a
howling
colony
of
cats
.
It
is
all
a
*NL*
groping
and
ignorant
effort
to
construct
out
of
base
metal
and
brass
*NL*
filings
,
so
to
speak
,
something
to
take
the
place
of
that
golden
treasure
*NL*
denied
them
by
Nature
,
a
child
.
But
this
is
a
digression
.
The
unwritten
*NL*
law
of
this
region
requires
you
to
kill
Judge
Driscoll
on
sight
,
and
he
*NL*
and
the
community
will
expect
that
attention
at
your
hands
--
though
of
*NL*
course
your
own
death
by
his
bullet
will
answer
every
purpose
.
Look
out
*NL*
for
him
!
Are
you
healed
--
that
is
,
fixed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
shall
have
his
opportunity
.
If
he
attacks
me
,
I
will
respond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Wilson
was
leaving
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
judge
is
still
a
little
used
up
by
his
campaign
work
,
and
will
not
*NL*
get
out
for
a
day
or
so
;
but
when
he
does
get
out
,
you
want
to
be
on
the
*NL*
alert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
About
eleven
at
night
the
twins
went
out
for
exercise
,
and
started
on
a
*NL*
long
stroll
in
the
veiled
moonlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Driscoll
had
landed
at
Hackett
's
Store
,
two
miles
below
Dawson
's
,
*NL*
just
about
half
an
hour
earlier
,
the
only
passenger
for
that
lonely
spot
,
*NL*
and
had
walked
up
the
shore
road
and
entered
Judge
Driscoll
's
house
*NL*
without
having
encountered
anyone
either
on
the
road
or
under
the
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
down
his
window
blinds
and
lighted
his
candle
.
He
laid
off
his
*NL*
coat
and
hat
and
began
his
preparations
.
He
unlocked
his
trunk
and
got
*NL*
his
suit
of
girl
's
clothes
out
from
under
the
male
attire
in
it
,
and
laid
*NL*
it
by
.
Then
he
blacked
his
face
with
burnt
cork
and
put
the
cork
in
his
*NL*
pocket
.
His
plan
was
to
slip
down
to
his
uncle
's
private
sitting
room
*NL*
below
,
pass
into
the
bedroom
,
steal
the
safe
key
from
the
old
gentleman
's
*NL*
clothes
,
and
then
go
back
and
rob
the
safe
.
He
took
up
his
candle
to
*NL*
start
.
His
courage
and
confidence
were
high
,
up
to
this
point
,
but
both
*NL*
began
to
waver
a
little
now
.
Suppose
he
should
make
a
noise
,
by
some
*NL*
accident
,
and
get
caught
--
say
,
in
the
act
of
opening
the
safe
?
Perhaps
*NL*
it
would
be
well
to
go
armed
.
He
took
the
Indian
knife
from
its
hiding
*NL*
place
,
and
felt
a
pleasant
return
of
his
wandering
courage
.
He
slipped
*NL*
stealthily
down
the
narrow
stair
,
his
hair
rising
and
his
pulses
halting
*NL*
at
the
slightest
creak
.
When
he
was
halfway
down
,
he
was
disturbed
to
*NL*
perceive
that
the
landing
below
was
touched
by
a
faint
glow
of
light
.
*NL*
What
could
that
mean
?
Was
his
uncle
still
up
?
No
,
that
was
not
likely
;
*NL*
he
must
have
left
his
night
taper
there
when
he
went
to
bed
.
Tom
crept
*NL*
on
down
,
pausing
at
every
step
to
listen
.
He
found
the
door
standing
*NL*
open
,
and
glanced
in
.
What
he
saw
pleased
him
beyond
measure
.
His
uncle
*NL*
was
asleep
on
the
sofa
;
on
a
small
table
at
the
head
of
the
sofa
a
lamp
*NL*
was
burning
low
,
and
by
it
stood
the
old
man
's
small
cashbox
,
closed
.
*NL*
Near
the
box
was
a
pile
of
bank
notes
and
a
piece
of
paper
covered
with
*NL*
figures
in
pencil
.
The
safe
door
was
not
open
.
Evidently
the
sleeper
had
*NL*
wearied
himself
with
work
upon
his
finances
,
and
was
taking
a
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
set
his
candle
on
the
stairs
,
and
began
to
make
his
way
toward
the
*NL*
pile
of
notes
,
stooping
low
as
he
went
.
When
he
was
passing
his
uncle
,
*NL*
the
old
man
stirred
in
his
sleep
,
and
Tom
stopped
instantly
--
stopped
,
and
*NL*
softly
drew
the
knife
from
its
sheath
,
with
his
heart
thumping
,
and
his
*NL*
eyes
fastened
upon
his
benefactor
's
face
.
After
a
moment
or
two
he
*NL*
ventured
forward
again
--
one
step
--
reached
for
his
prize
and
seized
it
,
*NL*
dropping
the
knife
sheath
.
Then
he
felt
the
old
man
's
strong
grip
upon
*NL*
him
,
and
a
wild
cry
of
``
Help
!
help
!
''
rang
in
his
ear
.
Without
hesitation
*NL*
he
drove
the
knife
home
--
and
was
free
.
Some
of
the
notes
escaped
from
his
*NL*
left
hand
and
fell
in
the
blood
on
the
floor
.
He
dropped
the
knife
and
*NL*
snatched
them
up
and
started
to
fly
;
transferred
them
to
his
left
hand
,
*NL*
and
seized
the
knife
again
,
in
his
fright
and
confusion
,
but
remembered
*NL*
himself
and
flung
it
from
him
,
as
being
a
dangerous
witness
to
carry
away
*NL*
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
for
the
stair-foot
,
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
;
and
as
he
*NL*
snatched
his
candle
and
fled
upward
,
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
*NL*
broken
by
the
sound
of
urgent
footsteps
approaching
the
house
.
In
another
*NL*
moment
he
was
in
his
room
,
and
the
twins
were
standing
aghast
over
the
*NL*
body
of
the
murdered
man
!
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
put
on
his
coat
,
buttoned
his
hat
under
it
,
threw
on
his
suit
of
*NL*
girl
's
clothes
,
dropped
the
veil
,
blew
out
his
light
,
locked
the
room
*NL*
door
by
which
he
had
just
entered
,
taking
the
key
,
passed
through
his
*NL*
other
door
into
the
black
hall
,
locked
that
door
and
kept
the
key
,
then
*NL*
worked
his
way
along
in
the
dark
and
descended
the
black
stairs
.
He
was
*NL*
not
expecting
to
meet
anybody
,
for
all
interest
was
centered
in
the
other
*NL*
part
of
the
house
now
;
his
calculation
proved
correct
.
By
the
time
he
*NL*
was
passing
through
the
backyard
,
Mrs.
Pratt
,
her
servants
,
and
a
dozen
*NL*
half-dressed
neighbors
had
joined
the
twins
and
the
dead
,
and
accessions
*NL*
were
still
arriving
at
the
front
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Tom
,
quaking
as
with
a
palsy
,
passed
out
at
the
gate
,
three
women
came
*NL*
flying
from
the
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lane
.
They
rushed
by
*NL*
him
and
in
at
the
gate
,
asking
him
what
the
trouble
was
there
,
but
not
*NL*
waiting
for
an
answer
.
Tom
said
to
himself
,
``
Those
old
maids
waited
to
*NL*
dress
--
they
did
the
same
thing
the
night
Stevens
's
house
burned
down
next
*NL*
door
.
''
In
a
few
minutes
he
was
in
the
haunted
house
.
He
lighted
a
candle
*NL*
and
took
off
his
girl-clothes
.
There
was
blood
on
him
all
down
his
left
*NL*
side
,
and
his
right
hand
was
red
with
the
stains
of
the
blood-soaked
*NL*
notes
which
he
has
crushed
in
it
;
but
otherwise
he
was
free
from
this
*NL*
sort
of
evidence
.
He
cleansed
his
hand
on
the
straw
,
and
cleaned
most
of
*NL*
the
smut
from
his
face
.
Then
he
burned
the
male
and
female
attire
to
*NL*
ashes
,
scattered
the
ashes
,
and
put
on
a
disguise
proper
for
a
tramp
.
He
*NL*
blew
out
his
light
,
went
below
,
and
was
soon
loafing
down
the
river
road
*NL*
with
the
intent
to
borrow
and
use
one
of
Roxy
's
devices
.
He
found
a
*NL*
canoe
and
paddled
down
downstream
,
setting
the
canoe
adrift
as
dawn
*NL*
approached
,
and
making
his
way
by
land
to
the
next
village
,
where
he
kept
*NL*
out
of
sight
till
a
transient
steamer
came
along
,
and
then
took
deck
*NL*
passage
for
St.
Louis
.
He
was
ill
at
ease
until
Dawson
's
Landing
was
behind
*NL*
him
;
then
he
said
to
himself
,
``
All
the
detectives
on
earth
could
n't
trace
*NL*
me
now
;
there
's
not
a
vestige
of
a
clue
left
in
the
world
;
that
homicide
*NL*
will
take
its
place
with
the
permanent
mysteries
,
and
people
wo
n't
get
*NL*
done
trying
to
guess
out
the
secret
of
it
for
fifty
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
St.
Louis
,
next
morning
,
he
read
this
brief
telegram
in
the
*NL*
papers
--
dated
at
Dawson
's
Landing
:
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Driscoll
,
an
old
and
respected
citizen
,
was
assassinated
*NL*
here
about
midnight
by
a
profligate
Italian
nobleman
or
a
*NL*
barber
on
account
of
a
quarrel
growing
out
of
the
recent
*NL*
election
.
The
assassin
will
probably
be
lynched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
the
twins
!
''
soliloquized
Tom
.
``
How
lucky
!
It
is
the
knife
that
*NL*
has
done
him
this
grace
.
We
never
know
when
fortune
is
trying
to
favor
*NL*
us
.
I
actually
cursed
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
in
my
heart
for
putting
it
out
*NL*
of
my
power
to
sell
that
knife
.
I
take
it
back
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
now
rich
and
independent
.
He
arranged
with
the
planter
,
and
*NL*
mailed
to
Wilson
the
new
bill
of
sale
which
sold
Roxana
to
herself
;
then
*NL*
he
telegraphed
his
Aunt
Pratt
:
*NL*
*NL*
Have
seen
the
awful
news
in
the
papers
and
am
almost
*NL*
prostrated
with
grief
.
Shall
start
by
packet
today
.
Try
to
*NL*
bear
up
till
I
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Wilson
reached
the
house
of
mourning
and
had
gathered
such
details
*NL*
as
Mrs.
Pratt
and
the
rest
of
the
crowd
could
tell
him
,
he
took
command
*NL*
as
mayor
,
and
gave
orders
that
nothing
should
be
touched
,
but
everything
*NL*
left
as
it
was
until
Justice
Robinson
should
arrive
and
take
the
proper
*NL*
measures
as
coroner
.
He
cleared
everybody
out
of
the
room
but
the
twins
*NL*
and
himself
.
The
sheriff
soon
arrived
and
took
the
twins
away
to
jail
.
*NL*
Wilson
told
them
to
keep
heart
,
and
promised
to
do
his
best
in
their
*NL*
defense
when
the
case
should
come
to
trial
.
Justice
Robinson
came
*NL*
presently
,
and
with
him
Constable
Blake
.
They
examined
the
room
*NL*
thoroughly
.
They
found
the
knife
and
the
sheath
.
Wilson
noticed
that
*NL*
there
were
fingerprints
on
the
knife
's
handle
.
That
pleased
him
,
for
the
*NL*
twins
had
required
the
earliest
comers
to
make
a
scrutiny
of
their
hands
*NL*
and
clothes
,
and
neither
these
people
nor
Wilson
himself
had
found
any
*NL*
bloodstains
upon
them
.
Could
there
be
a
possibility
that
the
twins
had
*NL*
spoken
the
truth
when
they
had
said
they
found
the
man
dead
when
they
ran
*NL*
into
the
house
in
answer
to
the
cry
for
help
?
He
thought
of
that
*NL*
mysterious
girl
at
once
.
But
this
was
not
the
sort
of
work
for
a
girl
to
*NL*
be
engaged
in
.
No
matter
;
Tom
Driscoll
's
room
must
be
examined
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
coroner
's
jury
had
viewed
the
body
and
its
surroundings
,
Wilson
*NL*
suggested
a
search
upstairs
,
and
he
went
along
.
The
jury
forced
an
*NL*
entrance
to
Tom
's
room
,
but
found
nothing
,
of
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coroner
's
jury
found
that
the
homicide
was
committed
by
Luigi
,
and
*NL*
that
Angelo
was
accessory
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
town
was
bitter
against
the
misfortunates
,
and
for
the
first
few
days
*NL*
after
the
murder
they
were
in
constant
danger
of
being
lynched
.
The
*NL*
grand
jury
presently
indicted
Luigi
for
murder
in
the
first
degree
,
and
*NL*
Angelo
as
accessory
before
the
fact
.
The
twins
were
transferred
from
the
*NL*
city
jail
to
the
county
prison
to
await
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
examined
the
finger
marks
on
the
knife
handle
and
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
Neither
of
the
twins
made
those
marks
.
Then
manifestly
there
was
*NL*
another
person
concerned
,
either
in
his
own
interest
or
as
hired
*NL*
assassin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
who
could
it
be
?
That
,
he
must
try
to
find
out
.
The
safe
was
not
*NL*
opened
,
the
cashbox
was
closed
,
and
had
three
thousand
dollars
in
it
.
*NL*
Then
robbery
was
not
the
motive
,
and
revenge
was
.
Where
had
the
murdered
*NL*
man
an
enemy
except
Luigi
?
There
was
but
that
one
person
in
the
world
*NL*
with
a
deep
grudge
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mysterious
girl
!
The
girl
was
a
great
trial
to
Wilson
.
If
the
motive
*NL*
had
been
robbery
,
the
girl
might
answer
;
but
there
was
n't
any
girl
that
*NL*
would
want
to
take
this
old
man
's
life
for
revenge
.
He
had
no
quarrels
*NL*
with
girls
;
he
was
a
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
had
perfect
tracings
of
the
finger
marks
of
the
knife
handle
;
and
*NL*
among
his
glass
records
he
had
a
great
array
of
fingerprints
of
women
and
*NL*
girls
,
collected
during
the
last
fifteen
or
eighteen
years
,
but
he
*NL*
scanned
them
in
vain
,
they
successfully
withstood
every
test
;
among
them
*NL*
were
no
duplicates
of
the
prints
on
the
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
presence
of
the
knife
on
the
stage
of
the
murder
was
a
worrying
*NL*
circumstance
for
Wilson
.
A
week
previously
he
had
as
good
as
admitted
to
*NL*
himself
that
he
believed
Luigi
had
possessed
such
a
knife
,
and
that
he
*NL*
still
possessed
it
notwithstanding
his
pretense
that
it
had
been
stolen
.
*NL*
And
now
here
was
the
knife
,
and
with
it
the
twins
.
Half
the
town
had
*NL*
said
the
twins
were
humbugging
when
they
claimed
they
had
lost
their
*NL*
knife
,
and
now
these
people
were
joyful
,
and
said
,
``
I
told
you
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
their
fingerprints
had
been
on
the
handle
--
but
useless
to
bother
any
*NL*
further
about
that
;
the
fingerprints
on
the
handle
were
NOT
theirs
--
that
*NL*
he
knew
perfectly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
refused
to
suspect
Tom
;
for
first
,
Tom
could
n't
murder
anybody
--
he
*NL*
had
n't
character
enough
;
secondly
,
if
he
could
murder
a
person
he
*NL*
would
n't
select
his
doting
benefactor
and
nearest
relative
;
thirdly
,
*NL*
self-interest
was
in
the
way
;
for
while
the
uncle
lived
,
Tom
was
sure
of
*NL*
a
free
support
and
a
chance
to
get
the
destroyed
will
revived
again
,
but
*NL*
with
the
uncle
gone
,
that
chance
was
gone
too
.
It
was
true
the
will
had
*NL*
really
been
revived
,
as
was
now
discovered
,
but
Tom
could
not
have
been
*NL*
aware
of
it
,
or
he
would
have
spoken
of
it
,
in
his
native
talky
,
*NL*
unsecretive
way
.
Finally
,
Tom
was
in
St.
Louis
when
the
murder
was
done
,
*NL*
and
got
the
news
out
of
the
morning
journals
,
as
was
shown
by
his
*NL*
telegram
to
his
aunt
.
These
speculations
were
unemphasized
sensations
*NL*
rather
than
articulated
thoughts
,
for
Wilson
would
have
laughed
at
the
*NL*
idea
of
seriously
connecting
Tom
with
the
murder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
regarded
the
case
of
the
twins
as
desperate
--
in
fact
,
about
*NL*
hopeless
.
For
he
argued
that
if
a
confederate
was
not
found
,
an
*NL*
enlightened
Missouri
jury
would
hang
them
;
sure
;
if
a
confederate
was
*NL*
found
,
that
would
not
improve
the
matter
,
but
simply
furnish
one
more
*NL*
person
for
the
sheriff
to
hang
.
Nothing
could
save
the
twins
but
the
*NL*
discovery
of
a
person
who
did
the
murder
on
his
sole
personal
account
--
an
*NL*
undertaking
which
had
all
the
aspect
of
the
impossible
.
Still
,
the
*NL*
person
who
made
the
fingerprints
must
be
sought
.
The
twins
might
have
no
*NL*
case
WITH
them
,
but
they
certainly
would
have
none
without
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Wilson
mooned
around
,
thinking
,
thinking
,
guessing
,
guessing
,
day
and
*NL*
night
,
and
arriving
nowhere
.
Whenever
he
ran
across
a
girl
or
a
woman
he
*NL*
was
not
acquainted
with
,
he
got
her
fingerprints
,
on
one
pretext
or
*NL*
another
;
and
they
always
cost
him
a
sigh
when
he
got
home
,
for
they
never
*NL*
tallied
with
the
finger
marks
on
the
knife
handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
mysterious
girl
,
Tom
swore
he
knew
no
such
girl
,
and
did
not
*NL*
remember
ever
seeing
a
girl
wearing
a
dress
like
the
one
described
by
*NL*
Wilson
.
He
admitted
that
he
did
not
always
lock
his
room
,
and
that
*NL*
sometimes
the
servants
forgot
to
lock
the
house
doors
;
still
,
in
his
*NL*
opinion
the
girl
must
have
made
but
few
visits
or
she
would
have
been
*NL*
discovered
.
When
Wilson
tried
to
connect
her
with
the
stealing
raid
,
and
*NL*
thought
she
might
have
been
the
old
woman
's
confederate
,
if
not
the
very
*NL*
thief
disguised
as
an
old
woman
,
Tom
seemed
stuck
,
and
also
much
*NL*
interested
,
and
said
he
would
keep
a
sharp
eye
out
for
this
person
or
*NL*
persons
,
although
he
was
afraid
that
she
or
they
would
be
too
smart
to
*NL*
venture
again
into
a
town
where
everybody
would
now
be
on
the
watch
for
a
*NL*
good
while
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
was
pitying
Tom
,
he
looked
so
quiet
and
sorrowful
,
and
seemed
*NL*
to
feel
his
great
loss
so
deeply
.
He
was
playing
a
part
,
but
it
was
not
*NL*
all
a
part
.
The
picture
of
his
alleged
uncle
,
as
he
had
last
seen
him
,
*NL*
was
before
him
in
the
dark
pretty
frequently
,
when
he
was
away
,
and
*NL*
called
again
in
his
dreams
,
when
he
was
asleep
.
He
would
n't
go
into
the
*NL*
room
where
the
tragedy
had
happened
.
This
charmed
the
doting
Mrs.
Pratt
,
*NL*
who
realized
now
,
``
as
she
had
never
done
before
,
''
she
said
,
what
a
*NL*
sensitive
and
delicate
nature
her
darling
had
,
and
how
he
adored
his
poor
*NL*
uncle
.

CHAPTER
20

The
Murderer
Chuckles
*NL*
*NL*
_
Even
the
clearest
and
most
perfect
circumstantial
evidence
*NL*
is
likely
to
be
at
fault
,
after
all
,
and
therefore
ought
to
*NL*
be
received
with
great
caution
.
Take
the
case
of
any
pencil
,
*NL*
sharpened
by
any
woman
;
if
you
have
witnesses
,
you
will
find
*NL*
she
did
it
with
a
knife
;
but
if
you
take
simply
the
aspect
*NL*
of
the
pencil
,
you
will
say
she
did
it
with
her
teeth
.

Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
's
Calendar
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
weeks
dragged
along
,
no
friend
visiting
the
jailed
twins
but
their
*NL*
counsel
and
Aunt
Patsy
Cooper
,
and
the
day
of
trial
came
at
last
--
the
*NL*
heaviest
day
in
Wilson
's
life
;
for
with
all
his
tireless
diligence
he
had
*NL*
discovered
no
sign
or
trace
of
the
missing
confederate
.
``
Confederate
''
*NL*
was
the
term
he
had
long
ago
privately
accepted
for
that
person
--
not
as
*NL*
being
unquestionably
the
right
term
,
but
as
being
the
least
possibly
the
*NL*
right
one
,
though
he
was
never
able
to
understand
why
the
twins
did
not
*NL*
vanish
and
escape
,
as
the
confederate
had
done
,
instead
of
remaining
by
*NL*
the
murdered
man
and
getting
caught
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
courthouse
was
crowded
,
of
course
,
and
would
remain
so
to
the
finish
,
*NL*
for
not
only
in
the
town
itself
,
but
in
the
country
for
miles
around
,
the
*NL*
trial
was
the
one
topic
of
conversation
among
the
people
.
Mrs.
Pratt
,
in
*NL*
deep
mourning
,
and
Tom
with
a
weed
on
his
hat
,
had
seats
near
Pembroke
*NL*
Howard
,
the
public
prosecutor
,
and
back
of
them
sat
a
great
array
of
*NL*
friends
of
the
family
.
The
twins
had
but
one
friend
present
to
keep
*NL*
their
counsel
in
countenance
,
their
poor
old
sorrowing
landlady
.
She
sat
*NL*
near
Wilson
,
and
looked
her
friendliest
.
In
the
``
nigger
corner
''
sat
*NL*
Chambers
;
also
Roxy
,
with
good
clothes
on
,
and
her
bill
of
sale
in
her
*NL*
pocket
.
It
was
her
most
precious
possession
,
and
she
never
parted
with
*NL*
it
,
day
or
night
.
Tom
had
allowed
her
thirty-five
dollars
a
month
ever
*NL*
since
he
came
into
his
property
,
and
had
said
that
he
and
she
ought
to
be
*NL*
grateful
to
the
twins
for
making
them
rich
;
but
had
roused
such
a
temper
*NL*
in
her
by
this
speech
that
he
did
not
repeat
the
argument
afterward
.
She
*NL*
said
the
old
judge
had
treated
her
child
a
thousand
times
better
than
he
*NL*
deserved
,
and
had
never
done
her
an
unkindness
in
his
life
;
so
she
hated
*NL*
these
outlandish
devils
for
killing
him
,
and
should
n't
ever
sleep
*NL*
satisfied
till
she
saw
them
hanged
for
it
.
She
was
here
to
watch
the
*NL*
trial
now
,
and
was
going
to
lift
up
just
one
``
hooraw
''
over
it
if
the
*NL*
county
judge
put
her
in
jail
a
year
for
it
.
She
gave
her
turbaned
head
a
*NL*
toss
and
said
,
``
When
dat
verdic
'
comes
,
I
's
gwine
to
lif
'
dat
ROOF
,
now
,
*NL*
I
TELL
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pembroke
Howard
briefly
sketched
the
state
's
case
.
He
said
he
would
show
*NL*
by
a
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
without
break
or
fault
in
it
*NL*
anywhere
,
that
the
principal
prisoner
at
the
bar
committed
the
murder
;
*NL*
that
the
motive
was
partly
revenge
,
and
partly
a
desire
to
take
his
own
*NL*
life
out
of
jeopardy
,
and
that
his
brother
,
by
his
presence
,
was
a
*NL*
consenting
accessory
to
the
crime
;
a
crime
which
was
the
basest
known
to
*NL*
the
calendar
of
human
misdeeds
--
assassination
;
that
it
was
conceived
by
*NL*
the
blackest
of
hearts
and
consummated
by
the
cowardliest
of
hands
;
a
*NL*
crime
which
had
broken
a
loving
sister
's
heart
,
blighted
the
happiness
of
*NL*
a
young
nephew
who
was
as
dear
as
a
son
,
brought
inconsolable
grief
to
*NL*
many
friends
,
and
sorrow
and
loss
to
the
whole
community
.
The
utmost
*NL*
penalty
of
the
outraged
law
would
be
exacted
,
and
upon
the
accused
,
now
*NL*
present
at
the
bar
,
that
penalty
would
unquestionably
be
executed
.
He
*NL*
would
reserve
further
remark
until
his
closing
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
strongly
moved
,
and
so
also
was
the
whole
house
;
Mrs.
Pratt
and
*NL*
several
other
women
were
weeping
when
he
sat
down
,
and
many
an
eye
that
*NL*
was
full
of
hate
was
riveted
upon
the
unhappy
prisoners
.
*NL*
*NL*
Witness
after
witness
was
called
by
the
state
,
and
questioned
at
length
;
*NL*
but
the
cross
questioning
was
brief
.
Wilson
knew
they
could
furnish
*NL*
nothing
valuable
for
his
side
.
People
were
sorry
for
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
;
*NL*
his
budding
career
would
get
hurt
by
this
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
witnesses
swore
they
heard
Judge
Driscoll
say
in
his
public
*NL*
speech
that
the
twins
would
be
able
to
find
their
lost
knife
again
when
*NL*
they
needed
it
to
assassinate
somebody
with
.
This
was
not
news
,
but
now
*NL*
it
was
seen
to
have
been
sorrowfully
prophetic
,
and
a
profound
sensation
*NL*
quivered
through
the
hushed
courtroom
when
those
dismal
words
were
*NL*
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
public
prosecutor
rose
and
said
that
it
was
within
his
knowledge
,
*NL*
through
a
conversation
held
with
Judge
Driscoll
on
the
last
day
of
his
*NL*
life
,
that
counsel
for
the
defense
had
brought
him
a
challenge
from
the
*NL*
person
charged
at
the
bar
with
murder
;
that
he
had
refused
to
fight
with
*NL*
a
confessed
assassin
--
``
that
is
,
on
the
field
of
honor
,
''
but
had
added
*NL*
significantly
,
that
he
would
be
ready
for
him
elsewhere
.
Presumably
*NL*
the
person
here
charged
with
murder
was
warned
that
he
must
kill
or
be
*NL*
killed
the
first
time
he
should
meet
Judge
Driscoll
.
If
counsel
for
the
*NL*
defense
chose
to
let
the
statement
stand
so
,
he
would
not
call
him
to
the
*NL*
witness
stand
.
Mr.
Wilson
said
he
would
offer
no
denial
.
-LSB-
Murmurs
in
the
*NL*
house
:
``
It
is
getting
worse
and
worse
for
Wilson
's
case

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pratt
testified
that
she
heard
no
outcry
,
and
did
not
know
what
woke
*NL*
her
up
,
unless
it
was
the
sound
of
rapid
footsteps
approaching
the
front
*NL*
door
.
She
jumped
up
and
ran
out
in
the
hall
just
as
she
was
,
and
heard
*NL*
the
footsteps
flying
up
the
front
steps
and
then
following
behind
her
as
*NL*
she
ran
to
the
sitting
room
.
There
she
found
the
accused
standing
over
*NL*
her
murdered
brother
.

Here
she
broke
down
and
sobbed

Sensation
in
the
*NL*
court
.
-RSB-
Resuming
,
she
said
the
persons
entered
behind
her
were
Mr.
Rogers
*NL*
and
Mr.
Buckstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cross-examined
by
Wilson
,
she
said
the
twins
proclaimed
their
innocence
;
*NL*
declared
that
they
had
been
taking
a
walk
,
and
had
hurried
to
the
house
*NL*
in
response
to
a
cry
for
help
which
was
so
loud
and
strong
that
they
had
*NL*
heard
it
at
a
considerable
distance
;
that
they
begged
her
and
the
*NL*
gentlemen
just
mentioned
to
examine
their
hands
and
clothes
--
which
was
*NL*
done
,
and
no
blood
stains
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
Confirmatory
evidence
followed
from
Rogers
and
Buckstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
finding
of
the
knife
was
verified
,
the
advertisement
minutely
*NL*
describing
it
and
offering
a
reward
for
it
was
put
in
evidence
,
and
its
*NL*
exact
correspondence
with
that
description
proved
.
Then
followed
a
few
*NL*
minor
details
,
and
the
case
for
the
state
was
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
said
that
he
had
three
witnesses
,
the
Misses
Clarkson
,
who
would
*NL*
testify
that
they
met
a
veiled
young
woman
leaving
Judge
Driscoll
's
*NL*
premises
by
the
back
gate
a
few
minutes
after
the
cries
for
help
were
*NL*
heard
,
and
that
their
evidence
,
taken
with
certain
circumstantial
*NL*
evidence
which
he
would
call
the
court
's
attention
to
,
would
in
his
*NL*
opinion
convince
the
court
that
there
was
still
one
person
concerned
in
*NL*
this
crime
who
had
not
yet
been
found
,
and
also
that
a
stay
of
*NL*
proceedings
ought
to
be
granted
,
in
justice
to
his
clients
,
until
that
*NL*
person
should
be
discovered
.
As
it
was
late
,
he
would
ask
leave
to
defer
*NL*
the
examination
of
his
three
witnesses
until
the
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
poured
out
of
the
place
and
went
flocking
away
in
excited
*NL*
groups
and
couples
,
taking
the
events
of
the
session
over
with
vivacity
*NL*
and
consuming
interest
,
and
everybody
seemed
to
have
had
a
satisfactory
*NL*
and
enjoyable
day
except
the
accused
,
their
counsel
,
and
their
old
lady
*NL*
friend
.
There
was
no
cheer
among
these
,
and
no
substantial
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
parting
with
the
twins
Aunt
Patsy
did
attempt
a
good-night
with
a
gay
*NL*
pretense
of
hope
and
cheer
in
it
,
but
broke
down
without
finishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Absolutely
secure
as
Tom
considered
himself
to
be
,
the
opening
*NL*
solemnities
of
the
trial
had
nevertheless
oppressed
him
with
a
vague
*NL*
uneasiness
,
his
being
a
nature
sensitive
to
even
the
smallest
alarms
;
but
*NL*
from
the
moment
that
the
poverty
and
weakness
of
Wilson
's
case
lay
*NL*
exposed
to
the
court
,
he
was
comfortable
once
more
,
even
jubilant
.
He
*NL*
left
the
courtroom
sarcastically
sorry
for
Wilson
.
``
The
Clarksons
met
an
*NL*
unknown
woman
in
the
back
lane
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
THAT
is
his
case
!
*NL*
I
'll
give
him
a
century
to
find
her
in
--
a
couple
of
them
if
he
likes
.
A
*NL*
woman
who
does
n't
exist
any
longer
,
and
the
clothes
that
gave
her
her
sex
*NL*
burnt
up
and
the
ashes
thrown
away
--
oh
,
certainly
,
he
'll
find
HER
easy
*NL*
enough
!
''
This
reflection
set
him
to
admiring
,
for
the
hundredth
time
,
*NL*
the
shrewd
ingenuities
by
which
he
had
insured
himself
against
*NL*
detection
--
more
,
against
even
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
always
in
cases
like
this
there
is
some
little
detail
or
other
*NL*
overlooked
,
some
wee
little
track
or
trace
left
behind
,
and
detection
*NL*
follows
;
but
here
there
's
not
even
the
faintest
suggestion
of
a
trace
*NL*
left
.
No
more
than
a
bird
leaves
when
it
flies
through
the
air
--
yes
,
*NL*
through
the
night
,
you
may
say
.
The
man
that
can
track
a
bird
through
the
*NL*
air
in
the
dark
and
find
that
bird
is
the
man
to
track
me
out
and
find
*NL*
the
judge
's
assassin
--
no
other
need
apply
.
And
that
is
the
job
that
has
*NL*
been
laid
out
for
poor
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
,
of
all
people
in
the
world
!
*NL*
Lord
,
it
will
be
pathetically
funny
to
see
him
grubbing
and
groping
after
*NL*
that
woman
that
do
n't
exist
,
and
the
right
person
sitting
under
his
very
*NL*
nose
all
the
time
!
''
The
more
he
thought
the
situation
over
,
the
more
the
*NL*
humor
of
it
struck
him
.
Finally
he
said
,
``
I
'll
never
let
him
hear
the
*NL*
last
of
that
woman
.
Every
time
I
catch
him
in
company
,
to
his
dying
day
,
*NL*
I
'll
ask
him
in
the
guileless
affectionate
way
that
used
to
gravel
him
so
*NL*
when
I
inquired
how
his
unborn
law
business
was
coming
along
,
`
Got
on
her
*NL*
track
yet
--
hey
,
Pudd
`
nhead
?
'
''
He
wanted
to
laugh
,
but
that
would
not
*NL*
have
answered
;
there
were
people
about
,
and
he
was
mourning
for
his
*NL*
uncle
.
He
made
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
good
entertainment
to
look
*NL*
in
on
Wilson
that
night
and
watch
him
worry
over
his
barren
law
case
and
*NL*
goad
him
with
an
exasperating
word
or
two
of
sympathy
and
commiseration
*NL*
now
and
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
wanted
no
supper
,
he
had
no
appetite
.
He
got
out
all
the
*NL*
fingerprints
of
girls
and
women
in
his
collection
of
records
and
pored
*NL*
gloomily
over
them
an
hour
or
more
,
trying
to
convince
himself
that
that
*NL*
troublesome
girl
's
marks
were
there
somewhere
and
had
been
overlooked
.
*NL*
But
it
was
not
so
.
He
drew
back
his
chair
,
clasped
his
hands
over
his
*NL*
head
,
and
gave
himself
up
to
dull
and
arid
musings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Driscoll
dropped
in
,
an
hour
after
dark
,
and
said
with
a
pleasant
*NL*
laugh
as
he
took
a
seat
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
we
've
gone
back
to
the
amusements
of
our
days
of
neglect
and
*NL*
obscurity
for
consolation
,
have
we
?
''
and
he
took
up
one
of
the
glass
*NL*
strips
and
held
it
against
the
light
to
inspect
it
.
``
Come
,
cheer
up
,
old
*NL*
man
;
there
's
no
use
in
losing
your
grip
and
going
back
to
this
child
's
*NL*
play
merely
because
this
big
sunspot
is
drifting
across
your
shiny
new
*NL*
disk
.
It
'll
pass
,
and
you
'll
be
all
right
again
''
--
and
he
laid
the
glass
*NL*
down
.
``
Did
you
think
you
could
win
always
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Wilson
,
with
a
sigh
,
``
I
did
n't
expect
that
,
but
I
ca
n't
*NL*
believe
Luigi
killed
your
uncle
,
and
I
feel
very
sorry
for
him
.
It
makes
*NL*
me
blue
.
And
you
would
feel
as
I
do
,
Tom
,
if
you
were
not
prejudiced
*NL*
against
those
young
fellows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
''
and
Tom
's
countenance
darkened
,
for
his
memory
*NL*
reverted
to
his
kicking
.
``
I
owe
them
no
good
will
,
considering
the
*NL*
brunet
one
's
treatment
of
me
that
night
.
Prejudice
or
no
prejudice
,
*NL*
Pudd
`
nhead
,
I
do
n't
like
them
,
and
when
they
get
their
deserts
you
're
not
*NL*
going
to
find
me
sitting
on
the
mourner
's
bench
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
up
another
strip
of
glass
,
and
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
here
's
old
Roxy
's
label
!
Are
you
going
to
ornament
the
royal
*NL*
palaces
with
nigger
paw
marks
,
too
?
By
the
date
here
,
I
was
seven
months
*NL*
old
when
this
was
done
,
and
she
was
nursing
me
and
her
little
nigger
cub
.
*NL*
There
's
a
line
straight
across
her
thumbprint
.
How
comes
that
?
''
and
Tom
*NL*
held
out
the
piece
of
glass
to
Wilson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
common
,
''
said
the
bored
man
,
wearily
.
``
Scar
of
a
cut
or
a
*NL*
scratch
,
usually
''
--
and
he
took
the
strip
of
glass
indifferently
,
and
*NL*
raised
it
toward
the
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
blood
sank
suddenly
out
of
his
face
;
his
hand
quaked
,
and
he
*NL*
gazed
at
the
polished
surface
before
him
with
the
glassy
stare
of
a
*NL*
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
heavens
,
what
's
the
matter
with
you
,
Wilson
?
Are
you
going
to
*NL*
faint
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
sprang
for
a
glass
of
water
and
offered
it
,
but
Wilson
shrank
*NL*
shuddering
from
him
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
--
take
it
away
!
''
His
breast
was
rising
and
falling
,
and
he
moved
*NL*
his
head
about
in
a
dull
and
wandering
way
,
like
a
person
who
had
been
*NL*
stunned
.
Presently
he
said
,
``
I
shall
feel
better
when
I
get
to
bed
;
I
*NL*
have
been
overwrought
today
;
yes
,
and
overworked
for
many
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
leave
you
and
let
you
get
to
your
rest
.
Good
night
,
old
man
.
''
*NL*
But
as
Tom
went
out
he
could
n't
deny
himself
a
small
parting
gibe
:
*NL*
``
Do
n't
take
it
so
hard
;
a
body
ca
n't
win
every
time
;
you
'll
hang
somebody
*NL*
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
muttered
to
himself
,
``
It
is
no
lie
to
say
I
am
sorry
I
have
to
*NL*
begin
with
you
,
miserable
dog
though
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
braced
himself
up
with
a
glass
of
cold
whisky
,
and
went
to
work
again
.
*NL*
He
did
not
compare
the
new
finger
marks
unintentionally
left
by
Tom
a
few
*NL*
minutes
before
on
Roxy
's
glass
with
the
tracings
of
the
marks
left
on
the
*NL*
knife
handle
,
there
being
no
need
for
that
-LRB-
for
his
trained
eye
-RRB-
,
but
*NL*
busied
himself
with
another
matter
,
muttering
from
time
to
time
,
``
Idiot
*NL*
that
I
was
!
--
Nothing
but
a
GIRL
would
do
me
--
a
man
in
girl
's
clothes
*NL*
never
occurred
to
me
.
''
First
,
he
hunted
out
the
plate
containing
the
*NL*
fingerprints
made
by
Tom
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
,
and
laid
it
by
*NL*
itself
;
then
he
brought
forth
the
marks
made
by
Tom
's
baby
fingers
when
*NL*
he
was
a
suckling
of
seven
months
,
and
placed
these
two
plates
with
the
*NL*
one
containing
this
subject
's
newly
-LRB-
and
unconsciously
-RRB-
made
record
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
the
series
is
complete
,
''
he
said
with
satisfaction
,
and
sat
down
to
*NL*
inspect
these
things
and
enjoy
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
enjoyment
was
brief
.
He
stared
a
considerable
time
at
the
three
*NL*
strips
,
and
seemed
stupefied
with
astonishment
.
At
last
he
put
them
down
*NL*
and
said
,
``
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
at
all
--
hang
it
,
the
baby
's
do
n't
tally
*NL*
with
the
others
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
the
floor
for
half
an
hour
puzzling
over
his
enigma
,
then
he
*NL*
hunted
out
the
other
glass
plates
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
and
puzzled
over
these
things
a
good
while
,
but
kept
*NL*
muttering
,
``
It
's
no
use
;
I
ca
n't
understand
it

They
do
n't
tally
right
,
*NL*
and
yet
I
'll
swear
the
names
and
dates
are
right
,
and
so
of
course
they
*NL*
OUGHT
to
tally
.
I
never
labeled
one
of
these
thing
carelessly
in
my
*NL*
life

There
is
a
most
extraordinary
mystery
here

*NL*
He
was
tired
out
now
,
and
his
brains
were
beginning
to
clog
.
He
said
he
*NL*
would
sleep
himself
fresh
,
and
then
see
what
he
could
do
with
this
*NL*
riddle
.
He
slept
through
a
troubled
and
unrestful
hour
,
then
*NL*
unconsciousness
began
to
shred
away
,
and
presently
he
rose
drowsily
to
a
*NL*
sitting
posture
.
``
Now
what
was
that
dream
?
''
he
said
,
trying
to
recall
*NL*
it
.
``
What
was
that
dream
?
It
seemed
to
unravel
that
puz

He
landed
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
at
a
bound
,
without
finishing
the
*NL*
sentence
,
and
ran
and
turned
up
his
light
and
seized
his
``
records

''
He
*NL*
took
a
single
swift
glance
at
them
and
cried
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
!
Heavens
,
what
a
revelation

And
for
twenty-three
years
no

APRIL
1
.
This
is
the
day
upon
which
we
are
reminded
of
what
*NL*
we
are
on
the
other
three
hundred
and
sixty-four

_
*NL*
--
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
's
Calendar
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
put
on
enough
clothes
for
business
purposes
and
went
to
work
*NL*
under
a
high
pressure
of
steam
.
He
was
awake
all
over
.
All
sense
of
*NL*
weariness
had
been
swept
away
by
the
invigorating
refreshment
of
the
*NL*
great
and
hopeful
discovery
which
he
had
made
.
He
made
fine
and
accurate
*NL*
reproductions
of
a
number
of
his
``
records
,
''
and
then
enlarged
them
on
a
*NL*
scale
of
ten
to
one
with
his
pantograph
.
He
did
these
pantograph
*NL*
enlargements
on
sheets
of
white
cardboard
,
and
made
each
individual
line
*NL*
of
the
bewildering
maze
of
whorls
or
curves
or
loops
which
consisted
of
*NL*
the
``
pattern
''
of
a
``
record
''
stand
out
bold
and
black
by
reinforcing
it
*NL*
with
ink
.
To
the
untrained
eye
the
collection
of
delicate
originals
made
*NL*
by
the
human
finger
on
the
glass
plates
looked
about
alike
;
but
when
*NL*
enlarged
ten
times
they
resembled
the
markings
of
a
block
of
wood
that
*NL*
has
been
sawed
across
the
grain
,
and
the
dullest
eye
could
detect
at
a
*NL*
glance
,
and
at
a
distance
of
many
feet
,
that
no
two
of
the
patterns
were
*NL*
alike
.
When
Wilson
had
at
last
finished
his
tedious
and
difficult
work
,
*NL*
he
arranged
his
results
according
to
a
plan
in
which
a
progressive
order
*NL*
and
sequence
was
a
principal
feature
;
then
he
added
to
the
batch
several
*NL*
pantograph
enlargements
which
he
had
made
from
time
to
time
in
bygone
*NL*
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
spent
and
the
day
well
advanced
now
.
By
the
time
he
had
*NL*
snatched
a
trifle
of
breakfast
,
it
was
nine
o'clock
,
and
the
court
was
*NL*
ready
to
begin
its
sitting
.
He
was
in
his
place
twelve
minutes
later
*NL*
with
his
``
records
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Driscoll
caught
a
slight
glimpse
of
the
records
,
and
nudged
his
*NL*
nearest
friend
and
said
,
with
a
wink
,
``
Pudd
`
nhead
's
got
a
rare
eye
to
*NL*
business
--
thinks
that
as
long
as
he
ca
n't
win
his
case
it
's
at
least
a
*NL*
noble
good
chance
to
advertise
his
window
palace
decorations
without
any
*NL*
expense
.
''
Wilson
was
informed
that
his
witnesses
had
been
delayed
,
but
*NL*
would
arrive
presently
;
but
he
rose
and
said
he
should
probably
not
have
*NL*
occasion
to
make
use
of
their
testimony
.
-LSB-
An
amused
murmur
ran
through
*NL*
the
room
:
``
It
's
a
clean
backdown
!
he
gives
up
without
hitting
a
lick
!
''
-RSB-
*NL*
Wilson
continued
:
``
I
have
other
testimony
--
and
better
.
-LSB-
This
compelled
*NL*
interest
,
and
evoked
murmurs
of
surprise
that
had
a
detectable
ingredient
*NL*
of
disappointment
in
them
.
-RSB-
If
I
seem
to
be
springing
this
evidence
upon
*NL*
the
court
,
I
offer
as
my
justification
for
this
,
that
I
did
not
discover
*NL*
its
existence
until
late
last
night
,
and
have
been
engaged
in
examining
*NL*
and
classifying
it
ever
since
,
until
half
an
hour
ago
.
I
shall
offer
it
*NL*
presently
;
but
first
I
wish
to
say
a
few
preliminary
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
it
please
the
court
,
the
claim
given
the
front
place
,
the
claim
most
*NL*
persistently
urged
,
the
claim
most
strenuously
and
I
may
even
say
*NL*
aggressively
and
defiantly
insisted
upon
by
the
prosecution
is
this
--
that
*NL*
the
person
whose
hand
left
the
bloodstained
fingerprints
upon
the
handle
*NL*
of
the
Indian
knife
is
the
person
who
committed
the
murder
.
''
Wilson
*NL*
paused
,
during
several
moments
,
to
give
impressiveness
to
what
he
was
*NL*
about
to
say
,
and
then
added
tranquilly
,
``
WE
GRANT
THAT
CLAIM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
electrical
surprise
.
No
one
was
prepared
for
such
an
*NL*
admission
.
A
buzz
of
astonishment
rose
on
all
sides
,
and
people
were
*NL*
heard
to
intimate
that
the
overworked
lawyer
had
lost
his
mind
.
Even
the
*NL*
veteran
judge
,
accustomed
as
he
was
to
legal
ambushes
and
masked
*NL*
batteries
in
criminal
procedure
,
was
not
sure
that
his
ears
were
not
*NL*
deceiving
him
,
and
asked
counsel
what
it
was
he
had
said
.
Howard
's
*NL*
impassive
face
betrayed
no
sign
,
but
his
attitude
and
bearing
lost
*NL*
something
of
their
careless
confidence
for
a
moment
.
Wilson
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
not
only
grant
that
claim
,
but
we
welcome
it
and
strongly
endorse
it
.
*NL*
Leaving
that
matter
for
the
present
,
we
will
now
proceed
to
consider
*NL*
other
points
in
the
case
which
we
propose
to
establish
by
evidence
,
and
*NL*
shall
include
that
one
in
the
chain
in
its
proper
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
made
up
his
mind
to
try
a
few
hardy
guesses
,
in
mapping
out
his
*NL*
theory
of
the
origin
and
motive
of
the
murder
--
guesses
designed
to
fill
*NL*
up
gaps
in
it
--
guesses
which
could
help
if
they
hit
,
and
would
probably
*NL*
do
no
harm
if
they
did
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
my
mind
,
certain
circumstances
of
the
case
before
the
court
seem
to
*NL*
suggest
a
motive
for
the
homicide
quite
different
from
the
one
insisted
*NL*
on
by
the
state
.
It
is
my
conviction
that
the
motive
was
not
revenge
,
*NL*
but
robbery
.
It
has
been
urged
that
the
presence
of
the
accused
brothers
*NL*
in
that
fatal
room
,
just
after
notification
that
one
of
them
must
take
*NL*
the
life
of
Judge
Driscoll
or
lose
his
own
the
moment
the
parties
should
*NL*
meet
,
clearly
signifies
that
the
natural
instinct
of
self-preservation
*NL*
moved
my
clients
to
go
there
secretly
and
save
Count
Luigi
by
destroying
*NL*
his
adversary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
they
stay
there
,
after
the
deed
was
done
?
Mrs.
Pratt
had
*NL*
time
,
although
she
did
not
hear
the
cry
for
help
,
but
woke
up
some
*NL*
moments
later
,
to
run
to
that
room
--
and
there
she
found
these
men
*NL*
standing
and
making
no
effort
to
escape
.
If
they
were
guilty
,
they
ought
*NL*
to
have
been
running
out
of
the
house
at
the
same
time
that
she
was
*NL*
running
to
that
room
.
If
they
had
had
such
a
strong
instinct
toward
*NL*
self-preservation
as
to
move
them
to
kill
that
unarmed
man
,
what
had
*NL*
become
of
it
now
,
when
it
should
have
been
more
alert
than
ever
.
Would
*NL*
any
of
us
have
remained
there
?
Let
us
not
slander
our
intelligence
to
*NL*
that
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
stress
has
been
laid
upon
the
fact
that
the
accused
offered
a
very
*NL*
large
reward
for
the
knife
with
which
this
murder
was
done
;
that
no
thief
*NL*
came
forward
to
claim
that
extraordinary
reward
;
that
the
latter
fact
was
*NL*
good
circumstantial
evidence
that
the
claim
that
the
knife
had
been
*NL*
stolen
was
a
vanity
and
a
fraud
;
that
these
details
taken
in
connection
*NL*
with
the
memorable
and
apparently
prophetic
speech
of
the
deceased
*NL*
concerning
that
knife
,
and
the
final
discovery
of
that
very
knife
in
*NL*
the
fatal
room
where
no
living
person
was
found
present
with
the
*NL*
slaughtered
man
but
the
owner
of
the
knife
and
his
brother
,
form
an
*NL*
indestructible
chain
of
evidence
which
fixed
the
crime
upon
those
*NL*
unfortunate
strangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
presently
ask
to
be
sworn
,
and
shall
testify
that
there
was
*NL*
a
large
reward
offered
for
the
THIEF
,
also
;
and
it
was
offered
secretly
*NL*
and
not
advertised
;
that
this
fact
was
indiscreetly
mentioned
--
or
at
*NL*
least
tacitly
admitted
--
in
what
was
supposed
to
be
safe
circumstances
,
*NL*
but
may
NOT
have
been
.
The
thief
may
have
been
present
himself

-LSB-
Tom
*NL*
Driscoll
had
been
looking
at
the
speaker
,
but
dropped
his
eyes
at
this
*NL*
point
.
-RSB-
In
that
case
he
would
retain
the
knife
in
his
possession
,
not
*NL*
daring
to
offer
it
for
sale
,
or
for
pledge
in
a
pawnshop
.
-LSB-
There
was
a
*NL*
nodding
of
heads
among
the
audience
by
way
of
admission
that
this
was
not
*NL*
a
bad
stroke
.
-RSB-
I
shall
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
jury
that
there
*NL*
WAS
a
person
in
Judge
Driscoll
's
room
several
minutes
before
the
accused
*NL*
entered
it
.
-LSB-
This
produced
a
strong
sensation
;
the
last
drowsy
head
in
*NL*
the
courtroom
roused
up
now
,
and
made
preparation
to
listen
.
-RSB-
If
it
*NL*
shall
seem
necessary
,
I
will
prove
by
the
Misses
Clarkson
that
they
met
a
*NL*
veiled
person
--
ostensibly
a
woman
--
coming
out
of
the
back
gate
a
few
*NL*
minutes
after
the
cry
for
help
was
heard
.
This
person
was
not
a
woman
,
*NL*
but
a
man
dressed
in
woman
's
clothes
.
''
Another
sensation
.
Wilson
had
his
*NL*
eye
on
Tom
when
he
hazarded
this
guess
,
to
see
what
effect
it
would
*NL*
produce
.
He
was
satisfied
with
the
result
,
and
said
to
himself
,
``
It
was
*NL*
a
success
--
he
's
hit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
object
of
that
person
in
that
house
was
robbery
,
not
murder
.
It
is
*NL*
true
that
the
safe
was
not
open
,
but
there
was
an
ordinary
cashbox
on
the
*NL*
table
,
with
three
thousand
dollars
in
it
.
It
is
easily
supposable
that
*NL*
the
thief
was
concealed
in
the
house
;
that
he
knew
of
this
box
,
and
of
*NL*
its
owner
's
habit
of
counting
its
contents
and
arranging
his
accounts
at
*NL*
night
--
if
he
had
that
habit
,
which
I
do
not
assert
,
of
course
--
that
he
*NL*
tried
to
take
the
box
while
its
owner
slept
,
but
made
a
noise
and
was
*NL*
seized
,
and
had
to
use
the
knife
to
save
himself
from
capture
;
and
that
*NL*
he
fled
without
his
booty
because
he
heard
help
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
now
done
with
my
theory
,
and
will
proceed
to
the
evidences
by
*NL*
which
I
propose
to
try
to
prove
its
soundness

Wilson
took
up
several
of
*NL*
his
strips
of
glass
.
When
the
audience
recognized
these
familiar
*NL*
mementos
of
Pudd
`
nhead
's
old
time
childish
``
puttering
''
and
folly
,
the
*NL*
tense
and
funereal
interest
vanished
out
of
their
faces
,
and
the
house
*NL*
burst
into
volleys
of
relieving
and
refreshing
laughter
,
and
Tom
chirked
*NL*
up
and
joined
in
the
fun
himself
;
but
Wilson
was
apparently
not
*NL*
disturbed
.
He
arranged
his
records
on
the
table
before
him
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
the
indulgence

some
evidence

I
am
about
to
introduce

and
which
I
*NL*
shall
presently
ask
to
be
allowed
to
verify
under
oath
on
the
witness
*NL*
stand

Every
human
being
carries
with
him
from
his
cradle
to
his
grave
*NL*
certain
physical
marks
which
do
not
change
their
character
,
and
by
which
*NL*
he
can
always
be
identified
--
and
that
without
shade
of
doubt
or
question

*NL*
These
marks
are
his
signature
,
his
physiological
autograph

so
to
speak

this
autograph
can
not
be
counterfeited

nor
can
he
disguise
it
or
*NL*
hide
it
away
,
nor
can
it
become
illegible
by
the
wear
and
mutations
of

This
signature
is
not

age
can
change
that

recognition

it

not
his

for
duplicates
of
that
exist

it
is
not
his
form
,
for
duplicates
*NL*
of
that
exist
also
,
whereas
this
signature
is
each
man

very
own

there
*NL*
is
no
duplicate
of
it
among
the
swarming
populations

Every

had
his

up
to
the

now
,
and
*NL*
his

canted
to
one

and
was
minutely
scrutinizing
the

his

there
were

made
all
over

were

in

The

An

at

You

their

not

Yet
there

*NL*
Wilson
stopped
and
stood
silent
.
Inattention
dies
a
quick
and
sure
death
*NL*
when
a
speaker
does
that
.
The
stillness
gives
warning
that
something
is
*NL*
coming
.
All
palms
and
finger
balls
went
down
now
,
all
slouching
forms
*NL*
straightened
,
all
heads
came
up
,
all
eyes
were
fastened
upon
Wilson
's
*NL*
face
.
He
waited
yet
one
,
two
,
three
moments
,
to
let
his
pause
complete
*NL*
and
perfect
its
spell
upon
the
house
;
then
,
when
through
the
profound
*NL*
hush
he
could
hear
the
ticking
of
the
clock
on
the
wall
,
he
put
out
his
*NL*
hand
and
took
the
Indian
knife
by
the
blade
and
held
it
aloft
where
all
*NL*
could
see
the
sinister
spots
upon
its
ivory
handle
;
then
he
said
,
in
a
*NL*
level
and
passionless
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
this

stands
the

old

who
loved

whom

*NL*
all
loved

There
is
but
one
man
in
the
whole
earth

*NL*
duplicate

he
paused
and
raised
his

to
the
*NL*
pendulum
swinging
back
and
forth
--
``

please
God
we
will
produce

*NL*
*NL*
Stunned
,
distraught
,
unconscious
of
its
own
movement
,
the
house
half
*NL*
rose
,
as
if
expecting
to
see
the
murderer
appear
at
the
door
,
and
a
*NL*
breeze
of
muttered
ejaculations
swept
the
place
.
``
Order
in
the
*NL*
court
!
--
sit
down

''
This
from
the
sheriff
.
He
was
obeyed
,
and
quiet
*NL*
reigned
again
.
Wilson
stole
a
glance
at
Tom
,
and
said
to
himself
,
``
He
is
*NL*
flying
signals
of
distress
now
;
even
people
who
despise
him
are
pitying
*NL*
him

they
think
this
is
a
hard
ordeal
for
a
young
fellow
who
has
lost
his
*NL*
benefactor
by
so
cruel
a
stroke
--
and
they
are
right
.
''
He
resumed
his
*NL*
speech
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
more
than
twenty
years
I
have
amused
my
compulsory
leisure
with
*NL*
collecting
these
curious
physical

in

.
At
my
house
I
*NL*
have
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
them
.
Each
and
every
one
is
labeled
with
*NL*
name
and
date
;
not
labeled
the
next
day
or
even
the
next
hour
,
but
in
the
*NL*
very
minute
that
the
impression
was
taken
.
When
I
go
upon
the
witness
*NL*
stand
I
will
repeat
under
oath
the
things
which
I
am
now
saying
.
I
have
*NL*
the
fingerprints
of
the
court
,
the
sheriff
,
and
every
member
of
the
jury
.
*NL*
There
is
hardly
a
person
in
this
room
,
white
or
black
,
whose
natal
*NL*
signature
I
can
not
produce
,
and
not
one
of
them
can
so
disguise
himself
*NL*
that
I
can
not
pick
him
out
from
a
multitude
of
his
fellow
creatures
and
*NL*
unerringly
identify
him
by
his
hands
.
And
if
he
and
I
should
live
to
be
a
*NL*
hundred
I
could
still
do
it
.
-LSB-
The
interest
of
the
audience
was
steadily
*NL*
deepening
now
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
studied
some
of
these

so
much
that
I
know
them
as
well
*NL*
as
the
bank
cashier
knows
the
autograph
of
his

While
I
*NL*
turn
my
back
now
,
I
beg
that
several
persons
will
be
so
good
as
to
pass
*NL*
their
fingers
through
their
hair
,
and
then
press
them
upon
one
of
the
*NL*
panes
of
the
window
near
the
jury
,
and
that
among
them
the
accused
may
*NL*
set
THEIR
finger
marks
.
Also
,
I
beg
that
these
experimenters
,
or
others
,
*NL*
will
set
their
fingers
upon
another
pane

and
add
again
the
marks

accused
,
but
not
placing
them
in
the

order
or
relation
to
the
other
*NL*
signatures
as
before
--
for
,
by
one
chance
in
a
million

a
person
might
*NL*
happen
upon
the
right
marks
by
pure
guesswork

ONCE

therefore
I
wish
to
*NL*
be
tested
twice

*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
his
back
,
and
the
two
panes
were
quickly
covered
with
*NL*
delicately
lined
oval
spots
,
but
visible
only
to
such
persons
as
could
*NL*
get
a
dark
background
for
them
--
the
foliage
of
a

,
outside
,
for
*NL*
instance
.
Then
upon
call
,
Wilson
went
to
the
window
,
made
his
*NL*
examination
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Count

He
faced
about

``

right

*NL*
A
deafening
explosion
of
applause
was
the
answer
.
The
bench
said
:

*NL*
``

certainly
approaches
the
miraculous

*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
turned
to
the
window
again
and
remarked

pointing
with
his

He
moved
to
his
place
through
a
storm
of
applause
--
which
the
sheriff
*NL*
stopped
,
and
also
made
the
people
sit
down
,
for
they
were
all
standing
*NL*
and
struggling
to
see

of
course

Court

and
everybody
*NL*
had
been

absorbed

audience
earlier

*NL*
*NL*
``

exactly
copy
each

are
quite

you
observe

I

refer

ask

*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
a
powerful
magnifying
glass
to
the
foreman
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
juryman
after
another
took
the
cardboard
and
the
glass
and
made
the
*NL*
comparison
.
Then
the
foreman
said
to
the
judge
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

said
to
the

*NL*
*NL*
``

Again
the

``

*NL*
*NL*
Wilson
turned
toward
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
,
and
there
was
a
*NL*
clearly
recognizable
note
of
warning
in
his
voice
when
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
it
please

strenuously

*NL*
persistently

He
turned
to
the
jury
:
``
Compare
the
*NL*
fingerprints

the
accused
with
the

left
by
the
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
comparison
began
.
As
it
proceeded
,
all
movement
and
all
sound
*NL*
ceased
,
and
the
deep
silence
of
an
absorbed
and
waiting
suspense
settled
*NL*
upon
the
house
;
and
when
at
last
the
words
came
,
``
THEY
DO
NOT
EVEN
*NL*
RESEMBLE

''
a
thundercrash
of
applause
followed
and
the
house
sprang
to
*NL*
its
feet
,
but
was
quickly
repressed
by
official
force
and
brought
to
*NL*
order
again
.
Tom
was
altering
his
position
every
few
minutes
now
,
but
*NL*
none
of
his
changes
brought
repose
nor
any
small
trifle
of
comfort

When
*NL*
the
house

attention
was
become
fixed
once
more

Wilson
said
gravely
,
*NL*
indicating
the
twins
with
a
gesture
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
These

Another

outbreak
of

began

promptly
checked

-RSB-

now

Tom

-RSB-

This
produced
a
vast

naturally

Roxana
was
astonished
at
this

admirable
guess

not
disturbed
by
it

To

the

was
one

thing

to
guess
who
did
it
quite
another

Pudd

She

smiled
privately

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
made
one
of
this
effect

collecting
pauses

added

*NL*
Roxy

The

thrilled

half
rose
as

a

Tom

growing
limp

the

Wilson
resumed
:

``

Tom
turned
his

imploring

made

slid

broke

Roxy
flung
herself

covered

out

Calendar
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
town
sat
up
all
night
to
discuss
the
amazing
events
of
the
day
and
*NL*
swap
guesses
as
to
when
Tom
's
trial
would
begin
.
Troop
after
troop
of
*NL*
citizens
came
to
serenade
Wilson
,
and
require
a
speech
,
and
shout
*NL*
themselves
hoarse
over
every
sentence
that
fell
from
his
lips
--
for
all
*NL*
his
sentences
were
golden
,
now
,
all
were
marvelous
.
His
long
fight
*NL*
against
hard
luck
and
prejudice
was
ended
;
he
was
a
made
man
for
good
.
*NL*
And
as
each
of
these
roaring
gangs
of
enthusiasts
marched
away
,
some
*NL*
remorseful
member
of
it
was
quite
sure
to
raise
his
voice
and
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
the
man
the
likes
of
us
have
called
a
pudd
`
nhead
for

*NL*
than

He
has
resigned

that

*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
it
is

we

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
twins
were
heroes
of
romance
,
now
,
and
with
rehabilitated
*NL*
reputations
.
But
they
were
weary
of
Western
adventure
,
and
straightway
*NL*
retired
to
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Roxy
's
heart
was
broken
.
The
young
fellow
upon
whom
she
had
inflicted
*NL*
twenty-three
years
of
slavery
continued
the
false
heir
's
pension
of
*NL*
thirty-five
dollars
a
month
to
her
,
but
her
hurts
were
too
deep
for
money
*NL*
to
heal
;
the
spirit
in
her
eye
was
quenched
,
her
martial
bearing
departed
*NL*
with
it
,
and
the
voice
of
her
laughter
ceased
in
the
land
.
In
her
church
*NL*
and
its
affairs
she
found
her
only
solace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
real
heir
suddenly
found
himself
rich
and
free
,
but
in
a
most
*NL*
embarrassing
situation
.
He
could
neither
read
nor
write
,
and
his
speech
*NL*
was
the
basest
dialect
of
the
Negro
quarter
.
His
gait
,
his
attitudes
,
his
*NL*
gestures
,
his
bearing
,
his
laugh
--
all
were
vulgar
and
uncouth
;
his
*NL*
manners
were
the
manners
of
a
slave
.
Money
and
fine
clothes
could
not
*NL*
mend
these
defects
or
cover
them
up
;
they
only
made
them
more
glaring
and
*NL*
the
more
pathetic
.
The
poor
fellow
could
not
endure
the
terrors
of
the
*NL*
white
man
's
parlor
,
and
felt
at
home
and
at
peace
nowhere
but
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
.
The
family
pew
was
a
misery
to
him
,
yet
he
could
nevermore
enter
*NL*
into
the
solacing
refuge
of
the
``
nigger
gallery
''
--
that
was
closed
to
him
*NL*
for
good
and
all
.
But
we
can
not
follow
his
curious
fate
further
--
that
*NL*
would
be
a
long
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
false
heir
made
a
full
confession
and
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
*NL*
for
life
.
But
now
a
complication
came
up
.
The
Percy
Driscoll
estate
was
*NL*
in
such
a
crippled
shape
when
its
owner
died
that
it
could
pay
only
sixty
*NL*
percent
of
its
great
indebtedness
,
and
was
settled
at
that
rate
.
But
the
*NL*
creditors
came
forward
now
,
and
complained
that
inasmuch
as
through
an
*NL*
error
for
which
THEY
were
in
no
way
to
blame
the
false
heir
was
not
*NL*
inventoried
at
the
time
with
the
rest
of
the
property
,
great
wrong
and
*NL*
loss
had
thereby
been
inflicted
upon
them
.
They
rightly
claimed
that
*NL*
``
Tom
''
was
lawfully
their
property
and
had
been
so
for
eight
years
;
that
*NL*
they
had
already
lost
sufficiently
in
being
deprived
of
his
services
*NL*
during
that
long
period
,
and
ought
not
to
be
required
to
add
anything
to
*NL*
that
loss
;
that
if
he
had
been
delivered
up
to
them
in
the
first
place
,
*NL*
they
would
have
sold
him
and
he
could
not
have
murdered
Judge
Driscoll
;
*NL*
therefore
it
was
not
that
he
had
really
committed
the
murder
,
the
guilt
*NL*
lay
with
the
erroneous
inventory
.
Everybody
saw
that
there
was
reason
in
*NL*
this
.
Everybody
granted
that
if
``
Tom
''
were
white
and
free
it
would
be
*NL*
unquestionably
right
to
punish
him
--
it
would
be
no
loss
to
anybody
;
but
*NL*
to
shut
up
a
valuable
slave
for
life
--
that
was
quite
another
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
Governor
understood
the
case
,
he
pardoned
Tom
at
once
,
and
*NL*
the
creditors
sold
him
down
the
river
.

AUTHOR
'S
NOTE
TO
``
THOSE
EXTRAORDINARY
TWINS
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
who
is
not
born
with
the
novel-writing
gift
has
a
troublesome
time
*NL*
of
it
when
he
tries
to
build
a
novel
.
I
know
this
from
experience
.
He
*NL*
has
no
clear
idea
of
his
story
;
in
fact
he
has
no
story
.
He
merely
has
*NL*
some
people
in
his
mind
,
and
an
incident
or
two
,
also
a
locality
,
and
he
*NL*
trusts
he
can
plunge
those
people
into
those
incidents
with
interesting
*NL*
results
.
So
he
goes
to
work
.
To
write
a
novel
?
No
--
that
is
a
thought
*NL*
which
comes
later
;
in
the
beginning
he
is
only
proposing
to
tell
a
little
*NL*
tale
,
a
very
little
tale
,
a
six-page
tale
.
But
as
it
is
a
tale
which
he
*NL*
is
not
acquainted
with
,
and
can
only
find
out
what
it
is
by
listening
as
*NL*
it
goes
along
telling
itself
,
it
is
more
than
apt
to
go
on
and
on
and
on
*NL*
till
it
spreads
itself
into
a
book
.
I
know
about
this
,
because
it
has
*NL*
happened
to
me
so
many
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
have
noticed
another
thing
:
that
as
the
short
tale
grows
into
the
*NL*
long
tale
,
the
original
intention
-LRB-
or
motif
-RRB-
is
apt
to
get
abolished
and
*NL*
find
itself
superseded
by
a
quite
different
one
.
It
was
so
in
the
case
*NL*
of
a
magazine
sketch
which
I
once
started
to
write
--
a
funny
and
fantastic
*NL*
sketch
about
a
prince
and
a
pauper
;
it
presently
assumed
a
grave
cast
of
*NL*
its
own
accord
,
and
in
that
new
shape
spread
itself
out
into
a
book
.
Much
*NL*
the
same
thing
happened
with
PUDD
`
NHEAD
WILSON
.
I
had
a
sufficiently
*NL*
hard
time
with
that
tale
,
because
it
changed
itself
from
a
farce
to
a
*NL*
tragedy
while
I
was
going
along
with
it
--
a
most
embarrassing
*NL*
circumstance
.
But
what
was
a
great
deal
worse
was
,
that
it
was
not
one
*NL*
story
,
but
two
stories
tangled
together
;
and
they
obstructed
and
*NL*
interrupted
each
other
at
every
turn
and
created
no
end
of
confusion
and
*NL*
annoyance
.
I
could
not
offer
the
book
for
publication
,
for
I
was
afraid
*NL*
it
would
unseat
the
reader
's
reason
,
I
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
*NL*
with
it
,
for
I
had
not
noticed
,
as
yet
,
that
it
was
two
stories
in
one
.
*NL*
It
took
me
months
to
make
that
discovery
.
I
carried
the
manuscript
back
*NL*
and
forth
across
the
Atlantic
two
or
three
times
,
and
read
it
and
studied
*NL*
over
it
on
shipboard
;
and
at
last
I
saw
where
the
difficulty
lay
.
I
had
*NL*
no
further
trouble
.
I
pulled
one
of
the
stories
out
by
the
roots
,
and
*NL*
left
the
other
--
a
kind
of
literary
Caesarean
operation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Would
the
reader
care
to
know
something
about
the
story
which
I
pulled
*NL*
out
?
He
has
been
told
many
a
time
how
the
born-and-trained
novelist
*NL*
works
;
wo
n't
he
let
me
round
and
complete
his
knowledge
by
telling
him
*NL*
how
the
jackleg
does
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Originally
the
story
was
called
THOSE
EXTRAORDINARY
TWINS
.
I
meant
to
*NL*
make
it
very
short
.
I
had
seen
a
picture
of
a
youthful
Italian
*NL*
``
freak
''
--
or
``
freaks
''
--
which
was
--
or
which
were
--
on
exhibition
in
our
*NL*
cities
--
a
combination
consisting
of
two
heads
and
four
arms
joined
to
a
*NL*
single
body
and
a
single
pair
of
legs
--
and
I
thought
I
would
write
an
*NL*
extravagantly
fantastic
little
story
with
this
freak
of
nature
for
*NL*
hero
--
or
heroes
--
a
silly
young
miss
for
heroine
,
and
two
old
ladies
and
*NL*
two
boys
for
the
minor
parts
.
I
lavishly
elaborated
these
people
and
*NL*
their
doings
,
of
course
.
But
the
tale
kept
spreading
along
and
spreading
*NL*
along
,
and
other
people
got
to
intruding
themselves
and
taking
up
more
*NL*
and
more
room
with
their
talk
and
their
affairs
.
Among
them
came
a
*NL*
stranger
named
Pudd
`
nhead
Wilson
,
and
a
woman
named
Roxana
;
and
presently
*NL*
the
doings
of
these
two
pushed
up
into
prominence
a
young
fellow
named
*NL*
Tom
Driscoll
,
whose
proper
place
was
away
in
the
obscure
background
.
*NL*
Before
the
book
was
half
finished
those
three
were
taking
things
almost
*NL*
entirely
into
their
own
hands
and
working
the
whole
tale
as
a
private
*NL*
venture
of
their
own
--
a
tale
which
they
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
,
by
*NL*
rights
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
book
was
finished
and
I
came
to
look
around
to
see
what
had
*NL*
become
of
the
team
I
had
originally
started
out
with
--
Aunt
Patsy
Cooper
,
*NL*
Aunt
Betsy
Hale
,
and
two
boys
,
and
Rowena
the
lightweight
heroine
--
they
*NL*
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
;
they
had
disappeared
from
the
story
some
time
or
*NL*
other
.
I
hunted
about
and
found
them
--
found
them
stranded
,
idle
,
*NL*
forgotten
,
and
permanently
useless
.
It
was
very
awkward
.
It
was
awkward
*NL*
all
around
,
but
more
particularly
in
the
case
of
Rowena
,
because
there
*NL*
was
a
love
match
on
,
between
her
and
one
of
the
twins
that
constituted
*NL*
the
freak
,
and
I
had
worked
it
up
to
a
blistering
heat
and
thrown
in
a
*NL*
quite
dramatic
love
quarrel
,
wherein
Rowena
scathingly
denounced
her
*NL*
betrothed
for
getting
drunk
,
and
scoffed
at
his
explanation
of
how
it
had
*NL*
happened
,
and
would
n't
listen
to
it
,
and
had
driven
him
from
her
in
the
*NL*
usual
``
forever
''
way
;
and
now
here
she
sat
crying
and
brokenhearted
;
for
*NL*
she
had
found
that
he
had
spoken
only
the
truth
;
that
it
was
not
he
,
but
*NL*
the
other
of
the
freak
that
had
drunk
the
liquor
that
made
him
drunk
;
*NL*
that
her
half
was
a
prohibitionist
and
had
never
drunk
a
drop
in
his
*NL*
life
,
and
altogether
tight
as
a
brick
three
days
in
the
week
,
was
wholly
*NL*
innocent
of
blame
;
and
indeed
,
when
sober
,
was
constantly
doing
all
he
*NL*
could
to
reform
his
brother
,
the
other
half
,
who
never
got
any
*NL*
satisfaction
out
of
drinking
,
anyway
,
because
liquor
never
affected
him
.
*NL*
Yes
,
here
she
was
,
stranded
with
that
deep
injustice
of
hers
torturing
*NL*
her
poor
torn
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
know
what
to
do
with
her
.
I
was
as
sorry
for
her
as
anybody
*NL*
could
be
,
but
the
campaign
was
over
,
the
book
was
finished
,
she
was
*NL*
sidetracked
,
and
there
was
no
possible
way
of
crowding
her
in
,
anywhere
.
*NL*
I
could
not
leave
her
there
,
of
course
;
it
would
not
do
.
After
spreading
*NL*
her
out
so
,
and
making
such
a
to-do
over
her
affairs
,
it
would
be
*NL*
absolutely
necessary
to
account
to
the
reader
for
her
.
I
thought
and
*NL*
thought
and
studied
and
studied
;
but
I
arrived
at
nothing
.
I
finally
saw
*NL*
plainly
that
there
was
really
no
way
but
one
--
I
must
simply
give
her
the
*NL*
grand
bounce
.
It
grieved
me
to
do
it
,
for
after
associating
with
her
so
*NL*
much
I
had
come
to
kind
of
like
her
after
a
fashion
,
notwithstanding
she
*NL*
was
such
an
ass
and
said
such
stupid
,
irritating
things
and
was
so
*NL*
nauseatingly
sentimental
.
Still
it
had
to
be
done
.
So
at
the
top
of
*NL*
Chapter
XVII
I
put
a
``
Calendar
''
remark
concerning
July
the
Fourth
,
and
*NL*
began
the
chapter
with
this
statistic
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rowena
went
out
in
the
backyard
after
supper
to
see
the
fireworks
and
*NL*
fell
down
the
well
and
got
drowned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
abrupt
,
but
I
thought
maybe
the
reader
would
n't
notice
it
,
*NL*
because
I
changed
the
subject
right
away
to
something
else
.
Anyway
it
*NL*
loosened
up
Rowena
from
where
she
was
stuck
and
got
her
out
of
the
way
,
*NL*
and
that
was
the
main
thing
.
It
seemed
a
prompt
good
way
of
weeding
out
*NL*
people
that
had
got
stalled
,
and
a
plenty
good
enough
way
for
those
*NL*
others
;
so
I
hunted
up
the
two
boys
and
said
,
``
They
went
out
back
one
*NL*
night
to
stone
the
cat
and
fell
down
the
well
and
got
drowned
.
''
Next
I
*NL*
searched
around
and
found
old
Aunt
Patsy
and
Aunt
Betsy
Hale
where
they
*NL*
were
around
,
and
said
,
``
They
went
out
back
one
night
to
visit
the
sick
*NL*
and
fell
down
the
well
and
got
drowned
.
''
I
was
going
to
drown
some
*NL*
others
,
but
I
gave
up
the
idea
,
partly
because
I
believed
that
if
I
kept
*NL*
that
up
it
would
arouse
attention
,
and
perhaps
sympathy
with
those
people
,
*NL*
and
partly
because
it
was
not
a
large
well
and
would
not
hold
any
more
*NL*
anyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
story
was
unsatisfactory
.
Here
was
a
set
of
new
characters
who
*NL*
were
become
inordinately
prominent
and
who
persisted
in
remaining
so
to
*NL*
the
end
;
and
back
yonder
was
an
older
set
who
made
a
large
noise
and
a
*NL*
great
to-do
for
a
little
while
and
then
suddenly
played
out
utterly
and
*NL*
fell
down
the
well
.
There
was
a
radical
defect
somewhere
,
and
I
must
*NL*
search
it
out
and
cure
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
defect
turned
out
to
be
the
one
already
spoken
of
--
two
stories
in
*NL*
one
,
a
farce
and
a
tragedy
.
So
I
pulled
out
the
farce
and
left
the
*NL*
tragedy
.
This
left
the
original
team
in
,
but
only
as
mere
names
,
not
as
*NL*
characters
.
Their
prominence
was
wholly
gone
;
they
were
not
even
worth
*NL*
drowning
;
so
I
removed
that
detail
.
Also
I
took
the
twins
apart
and
made
*NL*
two
separate
men
of
them
.
They
had
no
occasion
to
have
foreign
names
now
,
*NL*
but
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
remove
them
all
through
,
so
I
left
them
*NL*
christened
as
they
were
and
made
no
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
