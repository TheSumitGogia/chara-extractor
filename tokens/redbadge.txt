CHAPTER
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cold
passed
reluctantly
from
the
earth
,
and
the
retiring
fogs
*NL*
revealed
an
army
stretched
out
on
the
hills
,
resting
.
As
the
landscape
*NL*
changed
from
brown
to
green
,
the
army
awakened
,
and
began
to
tremble
*NL*
with
eagerness
at
the
noise
of
rumors
.
It
cast
its
eyes
upon
the
*NL*
roads
,
which
were
growing
from
long
troughs
of
liquid
mud
to
proper
*NL*
thoroughfares
.
A
river
,
amber-tinted
in
the
shadow
of
its
banks
,
*NL*
purled
at
the
army
's
feet
;
and
at
night
,
when
the
stream
had
become
of
*NL*
a
sorrowful
blackness
,
one
could
see
across
it
the
red
,
eyelike
gleam
*NL*
of
hostile
camp-fires
set
in
the
low
brows
of
distant
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
a
certain
tall
soldier
developed
virtues
and
went
resolutely
to
*NL*
wash
a
shirt
.
He
came
flying
back
from
a
brook
waving
his
garment
*NL*
bannerlike
.
He
was
swelled
with
a
tale
he
had
heard
from
a
reliable
*NL*
friend
,
who
had
heard
it
from
a
truthful
cavalryman
,
who
had
heard
it
*NL*
from
his
trustworthy
brother
,
one
of
the
orderlies
at
division
*NL*
headquarters
.
He
adopted
the
important
air
of
a
herald
in
red
and
*NL*
gold
.
``
We
're
goin
'
t
'
move
t
`
morrah
--
sure
,
''
he
said
pompously
to
a
*NL*
group
in
the
company
street
.
``
We
're
goin
'
`
way
up
the
river
,
cut
*NL*
across
,
an
'
come
around
in
behint
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
his
attentive
audience
he
drew
a
loud
and
elaborate
plan
of
a
very
*NL*
brilliant
campaign
.
When
he
had
finished
,
the
blue-clothed
men
*NL*
scattered
into
small
arguing
groups
between
the
rows
of
squat
brown
*NL*
huts
.
A
negro
teamster
who
had
been
dancing
upon
a
cracker
box
with
*NL*
the
hilarious
encouragement
of
twoscore
soldiers
was
deserted
.
He
sat
*NL*
mournfully
down
.
Smoke
drifted
lazily
from
a
multitude
of
quaint
*NL*
chimneys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lie
!
that
's
all
it
is
--
a
thunderin
'
lie
!
''
said
another
private
*NL*
loudly
.
His
smooth
face
was
flushed
,
and
his
hands
were
thrust
sulkily
*NL*
into
his
trousers
'
pockets
.
He
took
the
matter
as
an
affront
to
him
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
the
derned
old
army
's
ever
going
to
move
.
We
're
set
.
*NL*
I
've
got
ready
to
move
eight
times
in
the
last
two
weeks
,
and
we
ai
n't
*NL*
moved
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
soldier
felt
called
upon
to
defend
the
truth
of
a
rumor
he
*NL*
himself
had
introduced
.
He
and
the
loud
one
came
near
to
fighting
over
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
corporal
began
to
swear
before
the
assemblage
.
He
had
just
put
a
*NL*
costly
board
floor
in
his
house
,
he
said
.
During
the
early
spring
he
*NL*
had
refrained
from
adding
extensively
to
the
comfort
of
his
environment
*NL*
because
he
had
felt
that
the
army
might
start
on
the
march
at
any
*NL*
moment
.
Of
late
,
however
,
he
had
been
impressed
that
they
were
in
a
*NL*
sort
of
eternal
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
of
the
men
engaged
in
a
spirited
debate
.
One
outlined
in
a
*NL*
peculiarly
lucid
manner
all
the
plans
of
the
commanding
general
.
He
*NL*
was
opposed
by
men
who
advocated
that
there
were
other
plans
of
*NL*
campaign
.
They
clamored
at
each
other
,
numbers
making
futile
bids
for
*NL*
the
popular
attention
.
Meanwhile
,
the
soldier
who
had
fetched
the
*NL*
rumor
bustled
about
with
much
importance
.
He
was
continually
assailed
*NL*
by
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
up
,
Jim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Th
'
army
's
goin
'
t
'
move
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
yeh
talkin
'
about
?
How
yeh
know
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yeh
kin
b
`
lieve
me
er
not
,
jest
as
yeh
like
.
I
do
n't
care
a
*NL*
hang
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
much
food
for
thought
in
the
manner
in
which
he
replied
.
He
*NL*
came
near
to
convincing
them
by
disdaining
to
produce
proofs
.
They
grew
*NL*
excited
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
youthful
private
who
listened
with
eager
ears
to
the
words
*NL*
of
the
tall
soldier
and
to
the
varied
comments
of
his
comrades
.
After
*NL*
receiving
a
fill
of
discussions
concerning
marches
and
attacks
,
he
went
*NL*
to
his
hut
and
crawled
through
an
intricate
hole
that
served
it
as
a
*NL*
door
.
He
wished
to
be
alone
with
some
new
thoughts
that
had
lately
*NL*
come
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
down
on
a
wide
bank
that
stretched
across
the
end
of
the
room
.
*NL*
In
the
other
end
,
cracker
boxes
were
made
to
serve
as
furniture
.
They
*NL*
were
grouped
about
the
fireplace
.
A
picture
from
an
illustrated
weekly
*NL*
was
upon
the
log
walls
,
and
three
rifles
were
paralleled
on
pegs
.
*NL*
Equipments
hunt
on
handy
projections
,
and
some
tin
dishes
lay
upon
a
*NL*
small
pile
of
firewood
.
A
folded
tent
was
serving
as
a
roof
.
The
*NL*
sunlight
,
without
,
beating
upon
it
,
made
it
glow
a
light
yellow
shade
.
*NL*
A
small
window
shot
an
oblique
square
of
whiter
light
upon
the
*NL*
cluttered
floor
.
The
smoke
from
the
fire
at
times
neglected
the
clay
*NL*
chimney
and
wreathed
into
the
room
,
and
this
flimsy
chimney
of
clay
and
*NL*
sticks
made
endless
threats
to
set
ablaze
the
whole
establishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
was
in
a
little
trance
of
astonishment
.
So
they
were
at
last
*NL*
going
to
fight
.
On
the
morrow
,
perhaps
,
there
would
be
a
battle
,
and
*NL*
he
would
be
in
it
.
For
a
time
he
was
obliged
to
labor
to
make
himself
*NL*
believe
.
He
could
not
accept
with
assurance
an
omen
that
he
was
about
*NL*
to
mingle
in
one
of
those
great
affairs
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
of
course
,
dreamed
of
battles
all
his
life
--
of
vague
and
bloody
*NL*
conflicts
that
had
thrilled
him
with
their
sweep
and
fire
.
In
visions
*NL*
he
had
seen
himself
in
many
struggles
.
He
had
imagined
peoples
secure
*NL*
in
the
shadow
of
his
eagle-eyed
prowess
.
But
awake
he
had
regarded
*NL*
battles
as
crimson
blotches
on
the
pages
of
the
past
.
He
had
put
them
*NL*
as
things
of
the
bygone
with
his
thought-images
of
heavy
crowns
and
*NL*
high
castles
.
There
was
a
portion
of
the
world
's
history
which
he
had
*NL*
regarded
as
the
time
of
wars
,
but
it
,
he
thought
,
had
been
long
gone
*NL*
over
the
horizon
and
had
disappeared
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
his
home
his
youthful
eyes
had
looked
upon
the
war
in
his
own
*NL*
country
with
distrust
.
It
must
be
some
sort
of
a
play
affair
.
He
had
*NL*
long
despaired
of
witnessing
a
Greeklike
struggle
.
Such
would
be
no
*NL*
more
,
he
had
said
.
Men
were
better
,
or
more
timid
.
Secular
and
*NL*
religious
education
had
effaced
the
throat-grappling
instinct
,
or
else
*NL*
firm
finance
held
in
check
the
passions
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
burned
several
times
to
enlist
.
Tales
of
great
movements
shook
*NL*
the
land
.
They
might
not
be
distinctly
Homeric
,
but
there
seemed
to
be
*NL*
much
glory
in
them
.
He
had
read
of
marches
,
sieges
,
conflicts
,
and
he
*NL*
had
longed
to
see
it
all
.
His
busy
mind
had
drawn
for
him
large
*NL*
pictures
extravagant
in
color
,
lurid
with
breathless
deeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
mother
had
discouraged
him
.
She
had
affected
to
look
with
some
*NL*
contempt
upon
the
quality
of
his
war
ardor
and
patriotism
.
She
could
*NL*
calmly
seat
herself
and
with
no
apparent
difficulty
give
him
many
*NL*
hundreds
of
reasons
why
he
was
of
vastly
more
importance
on
the
farm
*NL*
than
on
the
field
of
battle
.
She
had
had
certain
ways
of
expression
*NL*
that
told
him
that
her
statements
on
the
subject
came
from
a
deep
*NL*
conviction
.
Moreover
,
on
her
side
,
was
his
belief
that
her
ethical
*NL*
motive
in
the
argument
was
impregnable
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
however
,
he
had
made
firm
rebellion
against
this
yellow
light
*NL*
thrown
upon
the
color
of
his
ambitions
.
The
newspapers
,
the
gossip
of
*NL*
the
village
,
his
own
picturings
had
aroused
him
to
an
uncheckable
*NL*
degree
.
They
were
in
truth
fighting
finely
down
there
.
Almost
every
*NL*
day
the
newspapers
printed
accounts
of
a
decisive
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
,
as
he
lay
in
bed
,
the
winds
had
carried
to
him
the
*NL*
clangoring
of
the
church
bell
as
some
enthusiast
jerked
the
rope
*NL*
frantically
to
tell
the
twisted
news
of
a
great
battle
.
This
voice
of
*NL*
the
people
rejoicing
in
the
night
had
made
him
shiver
in
a
prolonged
*NL*
ecstasy
of
excitement
.
Later
,
he
had
gone
down
to
his
mother
's
room
*NL*
and
had
spoken
thus
:
``
Ma
,
I
'm
going
to
enlist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
,
do
n't
you
be
a
fool
,
''
his
mother
had
replied
.
She
had
then
*NL*
covered
her
face
with
the
quilt
.
There
was
an
end
to
the
matter
for
*NL*
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
next
morning
he
had
gone
to
a
town
that
was
near
his
*NL*
mother
's
farm
and
had
enlisted
in
a
company
that
was
forming
there
.
*NL*
When
he
had
returned
home
his
mother
was
milking
the
brindle
cow
.
Four
*NL*
others
stood
waiting
.
``
Ma
,
I
've
enlisted
,
''
he
had
said
to
her
*NL*
diffidently
.
There
was
a
short
silence
.
``
The
Lord
's
will
be
done
,
*NL*
Henry
,
''
she
had
finally
replied
,
and
had
then
continued
to
milk
the
*NL*
brindle
cow
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
stood
in
the
doorway
with
his
soldier
's
clothes
on
his
*NL*
back
,
and
with
the
light
of
excitement
and
expectancy
in
his
eyes
*NL*
almost
defeating
the
glow
of
regret
for
the
home
bonds
,
he
had
seen
two
*NL*
tears
leaving
their
trails
on
his
mother
's
scarred
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
she
had
disappointed
him
by
saying
nothing
whatever
about
*NL*
returning
with
his
shield
or
on
it
.
He
had
privately
primed
himself
*NL*
for
a
beautiful
scene
.
He
had
prepared
certain
sentences
which
he
*NL*
thought
could
be
used
with
touching
effect
.
But
her
words
destroyed
*NL*
his
plans
.
She
had
doggedly
peeled
potatoes
and
addressed
him
as
*NL*
follows
:
``
You
watch
out
,
Henry
,
an
'
take
good
care
of
yerself
in
this
*NL*
here

*NL*

The

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
of
course
,
been
impatient
under
the
ordeal
of
this
speech
.
It
*NL*
had
not
been
quite
what
he
expected
,
and
he
had
borne
it
with
an
air
of
*NL*
irritation
.
He
departed
feeling
vague
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
when
he
had
looked
back
from
the
gate
,
he
had
seen
his
mother
*NL*
kneeling
among
the
potato
parings
.
Her
brown
face
,
upraised
,
was
*NL*
stained
with
tears
,
and
her
spare
form
was
quivering
.
He
bowed
his
*NL*
head
and
went
on
,
feeling
suddenly
ashamed
of
his
purposes
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
his
home
he
had
gone
to
the
seminary
to
bid
adieu
to
many
*NL*
schoolmates
.
They
had
thronged
about
him
with
wonder
and
admiration
.
*NL*
He
had
felt
the
gulf
now
between
them
and
had
swelled
with
calm
pride
.
*NL*
He
and
some
of
his
fellows
who
had
donned
blue
were
quite
overwhelmed
*NL*
with
privileges
for
all
of
one
afternoon
,
and
it
had
been
a
very
*NL*
delicious
thing
.
They
had
strutted
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
light-haired
girl
had
made
vivacious
fun
at
his
martial
*NL*
spirit
,
but
there
was
another
and
darker
girl
whom
he
had
gazed
at
*NL*
steadfastly
,
and
he
thought
she
grew
demure
and
sad
at
sight
of
his
*NL*
blue
and
brass
.
As
he
had
walked
down
the
path
between
the
rows
of
*NL*
oaks
,
he
had
turned
his
head
and
detected
her
at
a
window
watching
his
*NL*
departure
.
As
he
perceived
her
,
she
had
immediately
begun
to
stare
up
*NL*
through
the
high
tree
branches
at
the
sky
.
He
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
flurry
and
haste
in
her
movement
as
she
changed
her
attitude
.
He
often
*NL*
thought
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
to
Washington
his
spirit
had
soared
.
The
regiment
was
fed
*NL*
and
caressed
at
station
after
station
until
the
youth
had
believed
that
*NL*
he
must
be
a
hero
.
There
was
a
lavish
expenditure
of
bread
and
cold
*NL*
meats
,
coffee
,
and
pickles
and
cheese
.
As
he
basked
in
the
smiles
of
*NL*
the
girls
and
was
patted
and
complimented
by
the
old
men
,
he
had
felt
*NL*
growing
within
him
the
strength
to
do
mighty
deeds
of
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
complicated
journeyings
with
many
pauses
,
there
had
come
months
*NL*
of
monotonous
life
in
a
camp
.
He
had
had
the
belief
that
real
war
was
*NL*
a
series
of
death
struggles
with
small
time
in
between
for
sleep
and
*NL*
meals
;
but
since
his
regiment
had
come
to
the
field
the
army
had
done
*NL*
little
but
sit
still
and
try
to
keep
warm
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
brought
then
gradually
back
to
his
old
ideas
.
Greeklike
*NL*
struggles
would
be
no
more
.
Men
were
better
,
or
more
timid
.
Secular
*NL*
and
religious
education
had
effaced
the
throat-grappling
instinct
,
or
*NL*
else
firm
finance
held
in
check
the
passions
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
grown
to
regard
himself
merely
as
a
part
of
a
vast
blue
*NL*
demonstration
.
His
province
was
to
look
out
,
as
far
as
he
could
,
for
*NL*
his
personal
comfort
.
For
recreation
he
could
twiddle
his
thumbs
and
*NL*
speculate
on
the
thoughts
which
must
agitate
the
minds
of
the
generals
.
*NL*
Also
,
he
was
drilled
and
drilled
and
reviewed
,
and
drilled
and
drilled
*NL*
and
reviewed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
foes
he
had
seen
were
some
pickets
along
the
river
bank
.
They
*NL*
were
a
sun-tanned
,
philosophical
lot
,
who
sometimes
shot
reflectively
*NL*
at
the
blue
pickets
.
When
reproached
for
this
afterward
,
they
usually
*NL*
expressed
sorrow
,
and
swore
by
their
gods
that
the
guns
had
exploded
*NL*
without
their
permission
.
The
youth
,
on
guard
duty
one
night
,
*NL*
conversed
across
the
stream
with
one
of
them
.
He
was
a
slightly
ragged
*NL*
man
,
who
spat
skillfully
between
his
shoes
and
possessed
a
great
fund
*NL*
of
bland
and
infantile
assurance
.
The
youth
liked
him
personally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yank
,
''
the
other
had
informed
him
,
``
yer
a
right
dum
good
feller
.
''
This
*NL*
sentiment
,
floating
to
him
upon
the
still
air
,
had
made
him
temporarily
*NL*
regret
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
Various
veterans
had
told
him
tales
.
Some
talked
of
gray
,
bewhiskered
*NL*
hordes
who
were
advancing
with
relentless
curses
and
chewing
tobacco
*NL*
with
unspeakable
valor
;
tremendous
bodies
of
fierce
soldiery
who
were
*NL*
sweeping
along
like
the
Huns
.
Others
spoke
of
tattered
and
eternally
*NL*
hungry
men
who
fired
despondent
powders
.
``
They
'll
charge
through
*NL*
hell
's
fire
an
'
brimstone
t
'
git
a
holt
on
a
haversack
,
an
'
sech
*NL*
stomachs
ai
n't
a-lastin
'
long
,
''
he
was
told
.
From
the
stories
,
the
*NL*
youth
imagined
the
red
,
live
bones
sticking
out
through
slits
in
the
*NL*
faded
uniforms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
he
could
not
put
a
whole
faith
in
veterans
'
tales
,
for
recruits
*NL*
were
their
prey
.
They
talked
much
of
smoke
,
fire
,
and
blood
,
but
he
*NL*
could
not
tell
how
much
might
be
lies
.
They
persistently
yelled
``
Fresh
*NL*
fish
!
''
at
him
,
and
were
in
no
wise
to
be
trusted
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
perceived
now
that
it
did
not
greatly
matter
what
kind
of
*NL*
soldiers
he
was
going
to
fight
,
so
long
as
they
fought
,
which
fact
no
*NL*
one
disputed
.
There
was
a
more
serious
problem
.
He
lay
in
his
bunk
*NL*
pondering
upon
it
.
He
tried
to
mathematically
prove
to
himself
that
he
*NL*
would
not
run
from
a
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Previously
he
had
never
felt
obliged
to
wrestle
too
seriously
with
this
*NL*
question
.
In
his
life
he
had
taken
certain
things
for
granted
,
never
*NL*
challenging
his
belief
in
ultimate
success
,
and
bothering
little
about
*NL*
means
and
roads
.
But
here
he
was
confronted
with
a
thing
of
moment
.
It
*NL*
had
suddenly
appeared
to
him
that
perhaps
in
a
battle
he
might
run
.
He
*NL*
was
forced
to
admit
that
as
far
as
war
was
concerned
he
knew
nothing
of
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sufficient
time
before
he
would
have
allowed
the
problem
to
kick
its
*NL*
heels
at
the
outer
portals
of
his
mind
,
but
now
he
felt
compelled
to
*NL*
give
serious
attention
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
panic-fear
grew
in
his
mind
.
As
his
imagination
went
forward
*NL*
to
a
fight
,
he
saw
hideous
possibilities
.
He
contemplated
the
lurking
*NL*
menaces
of
the
future
,
and
failed
in
an
effort
to
see
himself
standing
*NL*
stoutly
in
the
midst
of
them
.
He
recalled
his
visions
of
broken-bladed
*NL*
glory
,
but
in
the
shadow
of
the
impending
tumult
he
suspected
them
to
*NL*
be
impossible
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sprang
from
the
bunk
and
began
to
pace
nervously
to
and
fro
.
``
Good
*NL*
Lord
,
what
's
th
'
matter
with
me
?
''
he
said
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
in
this
crisis
his
laws
of
life
were
useless
.
Whatever
he
*NL*
had
learned
of
himself
was
here
of
no
avail
.
He
was
an
unknown
*NL*
quantity
.
He
saw
that
he
would
again
be
obliged
to
experiment
as
he
had
*NL*
in
early
youth
.
He
must
accumulate
information
of
himself
,
and
*NL*
meanwhile
he
resolved
to
remain
close
upon
his
guard
lest
those
*NL*
qualities
of
which
he
knew
nothing
should
everlastingly
disgrace
him
.
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
''
he
repeated
in
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
the
tall
soldier
slid
dexterously
through
the
hole
.
The
*NL*
loud
private
followed
.
They
were
wrangling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
''
said
the
tall
soldier
as
he
entered
.
He
waved
his
*NL*
hand
expressively
.
``
You
can
believe
me
or
not
,
jest
as
you
like
.
All
*NL*
you
got
to
do
is
to
sit
down
and
wait
as
quiet
as
you
can
.
Then
pretty
*NL*
soon
you
'll
find
out
I
was
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
comrade
grunted
stubbornly
.
For
a
moment
he
seemed
to
be
searching
*NL*
for
a
formidable
reply
.
Finally
he
said
:
``
Well
,
you
do
n't
know
*NL*
everything
in
the
world
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
say
I
knew
everything
in
the
world
,
''
retorted
the
other
*NL*
sharply
.
He
began
to
stow
various
articles
snugly
into
his
knapsack
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
pausing
in
his
nervous
walk
,
looked
down
at
the
busy
figure
.
*NL*
``
Going
to
be
a
battle
,
sure
,
is
there
,
Jim
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
there
is
,
''
replied
the
tall
soldier
.
``
Of
course
there
is
.
*NL*
You
jest
wait
'til
to-morrow
,
and
you
'll
see
one
of
the
biggest
battles
*NL*
ever
was
.
You
jest
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thunder
!
''
said
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
'll
see
fighting
this
time
,
my
boy
,
what
'll
be
regular
*NL*
out-and-out
fighting
,
''
added
the
tall
soldier
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
*NL*
who
is
about
to
exhibit
a
battle
for
the
benefit
of
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh
!
''
said
the
loud
one
from
a
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
remarked
the
youth
,
``
like
as
not
this
story
'll
turn
out
jest
*NL*
like
them
others
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
it
wo
n't
,
''
replied
the
tall
soldier
,
exasperated
.
``
Not
much
*NL*
it
wo
n't
.
Did
n't
the
cavalry
all
start
this
morning
?
''
He
glared
about
*NL*
him
.
No
one
denied
his
statement
.
``
The
cavalry
started
this
morning
,
''
*NL*
he
continued
.
``
They
say
there
ai
n't
hardly
any
cavalry
left
in
camp
.
*NL*
They
're
going
to
Richmond
,
or
some
place
,
while
we
fight
all
the
*NL*
Johnnies
.
It
's
some
dodge
like
that
.
The
regiment
's
got
orders
,
too
.
*NL*
A
feller
what
seen
'em
go
to
headquarters
told
me
a
little
while
ago
.
*NL*
And
they
're
raising
blazes
all
over
camp
--
anybody
can
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shucks
!
''
said
the
loud
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
remained
silent
for
a
time
.
At
last
he
spoke
to
the
tall
*NL*
soldier
.
``
Jim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
think
the
reg
`
ment
'll
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
'll
fight
all
right
,
I
guess
,
after
they
once
get
into
it
,
''
*NL*
said
the
other
with
cold
judgment
.
He
made
a
fine
use
of
the
third
*NL*
person
.
``
There
's
been
heaps
of
fun
poked
at
'em
because
they
're
new
,
of
*NL*
course
,
and
all
that
;
but
they
'll
fight
all
right
,
I
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
any
of
the
boys
'll
run
?
''
persisted
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
may
be
a
few
of
'em
run
,
but
there
's
them
kind
in
every
*NL*
regiment
,
`
specially
when
they
first
goes
under
fire
,
''
said
the
other
*NL*
in
a
tolerant
way
.
``
Of
course
it
might
happen
that
the
hull
*NL*
kit-and-boodle
might
start
and
run
,
if
some
big
fighting
came
*NL*
first-off
,
and
then
again
they
might
stay
and
fight
like
fun
.
But
you
*NL*
ca
n't
bet
on
nothing
.
Of
course
they
ai
n't
never
been
under
fire
yet
,
*NL*
and
it
ai
n't
likely
they
'll
lick
the
hull
rebel
army
all-to-oncet
the
*NL*
first
time
;
but
I
think
they
'll
fight
better
than
some
,
if
worse
than
*NL*
others
.
That
's
the
way
I
figger
.
They
call
the
reg
`
ment
`
Fresh
fish
'
*NL*
and
everything
;
but
the
boys
come
of
good
stock
,
and
most
of
'em
'll
*NL*
fight
like
sin
after
they
oncet
git
shootin

,
''
he
added
,
with
a
mighty
*NL*
emphasis
on
the
last
four
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
think
you
know
--
''
began
the
loud
soldier
with
scorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
turned
savagely
upon
him
.
They
had
a
rapid
altercation
,
in
*NL*
which
they
fastened
upon
each
other
various
strange
epithets
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
at
last
interrupted
them
.
``
Did
you
ever
think
you
might
run
*NL*
yourself
,
Jim
?
''
he
asked
.
On
concluding
the
sentence
he
laughed
as
if
*NL*
he
had
meant
to
aim
a
joke
.
The
loud
soldier
also
giggled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
private
waved
his
hand
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
profoundly
,
``
I
've
*NL*
thought
it
might
get
too
hot
for
Jim
Conklin
in
some
of
them
*NL*
scrimmages

and
if
a
whole
lot
of
boys
started
and
run
,
why
,
I

pose
*NL*
I
'd
start
and
run

And
if
I
once
started
to
run

I
'd
run
like
the
*NL*
devil
,
and
no
mistake
.
But
if
everybody
was
a-standing
and
a-fighting
,
*NL*
why

I
'd
stand
and
fight

Be
jiminey

I
would

I
'll
bet
on
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh
!
''
said
the
loud
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
of
this
tale
felt
gratitude
for
these
words
of
his
comrade
.
*NL*
He
had
feared
that
all
of
the
untried
men
possessed
a
great
and
correct
*NL*
confidence
.
He
now
was
in
a
measure
reassured
.

CHAPTER
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
the
youth
discovered
that
his
tall
comrade
had
been
*NL*
the
fast-flying
messenger
of
a
mistake
.
There
was
much
scoffing
at
the
*NL*
latter
by
those
who
had
yesterday
been
firm
adherents
of
his
views
,
and
*NL*
there
was
even
a
little
sneering
by
men
who
had
never
believed
the
*NL*
rumor
.
The
tall
one
fought
with
a
man
from
Chatfield
Corners
and
beat
*NL*
him
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
felt
,
however
,
that
his
problem
was
in
no
wise
lifted
from
*NL*
him
.
There
was
,
on
the
contrary
,
an
irritating
prolongation
.
The
tale
*NL*
had
created
in
him
a
great
concern
for
himself
.
Now
,
with
the
newborn
*NL*
question
in
his
mind
,
he
was
compelled
to
sink
back
into
his
old
place
*NL*
as
part
of
a
blue
demonstration
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
days
he
made
ceaseless
calculations
,
but
they
were
all
wondrously
*NL*
unsatisfactory
.
He
found
that
he
could
establish
nothing
.
He
finally
*NL*
concluded
that
the
only
way
to
prove
himself
was
to
go
into
the
blaze
,
*NL*
and
then
figuratively
to
watch
his
legs
to
discover
their
merits
and
*NL*
faults
.
He
reluctantly
admitted
that
he
could
not
sit
still
and
with
a
*NL*
mental
slate
and
pencil
derive
an
answer
.
To
gain
it
,
he
must
have
*NL*
blaze
,
blood
,
and
danger
,
even
as
a
chemist
requires
this
,
that
,
and
*NL*
the
other
.
So
he
fretted
for
an
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
he
continually
tried
to
measure
himself
by
his
comrades
.
The
*NL*
tall
soldier
,
for
one
,
gave
him
some
assurance
.
This
man
's
serene
*NL*
unconcern
dealt
him
a
measure
of
confidence
,
for
he
had
known
him
since
*NL*
childhood
,
and
from
his
intimate
knowledge
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
*NL*
be
capable
of
anything
that
was
beyond
him
,
the
youth
.
Still
,
he
*NL*
thought
that
his
comrade
might
be
mistaken
about
himself
.
Or
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
he
might
be
a
man
heretofore
doomed
to
peace
and
obscurity
,
*NL*
but
,
in
reality
,
made
to
shine
in
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
would
have
liked
to
have
discovered
another
who
suspected
*NL*
himself
.
A
sympathetic
comparison
of
mental
notes
would
have
been
a
*NL*
joy
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
occasionally
tried
to
fathom
a
comrade
with
seductive
sentences
.
He
*NL*
looked
about
to
find
men
in
the
proper
mood
.
All
attempts
failed
to
*NL*
bring
forth
any
statement
which
looked
in
any
way
like
a
confession
to
*NL*
those
doubts
which
he
privately
acknowledged
in
himself
.
He
was
afraid
*NL*
to
make
an
open
declaration
of
his
concern
,
because
he
dreaded
to
place
*NL*
some
unscrupulous
confidant
upon
the
high
plane
of
the
unconfessed
from
*NL*
which
elevation
he
could
be
derided
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
regard
to
his
companions
his
mind
wavered
between
two
opinions
,
*NL*
according
to
his
mood
.
Sometimes
he
inclined
to
believing
them
all
*NL*
heroes
.
In
fact
,
he
usually
admitted
in
secret
the
superior
*NL*
development
of
the
higher
qualities
in
others
.
He
could
conceive
of
*NL*
men
going
very
insignificantly
about
the
world
bearing
a
load
of
*NL*
courage
unseen
,
and
although
he
had
known
many
of
his
comrades
through
*NL*
boyhood
,
he
began
to
fear
that
his
judgment
of
them
had
been
blind
.
*NL*
Then
,
in
other
moments
,
he
flouted
these
theories
,
and
assured
himself
*NL*
that
his
fellows
were
all
privately
wondering
and
quaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
emotions
made
him
feel
strange
in
the
presence
of
men
who
talked
*NL*
excitedly
of
a
prospective
battle
as
of
a
drama
they
were
about
to
*NL*
witness
,
with
nothing
but
eagerness
and
curiosity
apparent
in
their
*NL*
faces
.
It
was
often
that
he
suspected
them
to
be
liars
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
pass
such
thoughts
without
severe
condemnation
of
himself
.
*NL*
He
dinned
reproaches
at
times
.
He
was
convicted
by
himself
of
many
*NL*
shameful
crimes
against
the
gods
of
traditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
great
anxiety
his
heart
was
continually
clamoring
at
what
he
*NL*
considered
the
intolerable
slowness
of
the
generals
.
They
seemed
*NL*
content
to
perch
tranquilly
on
the
river
bank
,
and
leave
him
bowed
down
*NL*
by
the
weight
of
a
great
problem
.
He
wanted
it
settled
forthwith
.
He
*NL*
could
not
long
bear
such
a
load
,
he
said
.
Sometimes
his
anger
at
the
*NL*
commanders
reached
an
acute
stage
,
and
he
grumbled
about
the
camp
like
*NL*
a
veteran
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
however
,
he
found
himself
in
the
ranks
of
his
prepared
*NL*
regiment
.
The
men
were
whispering
speculations
and
recounting
the
old
*NL*
rumors
.
In
the
gloom
before
the
break
of
the
day
their
uniforms
glowed
*NL*
a
deep
purple
hue
.
From
across
the
river
the
red
eyes
were
still
*NL*
peering
.
In
the
eastern
sky
there
was
a
yellow
patch
like
a
rug
laid
*NL*
for
the
feet
of
the
coming
sun
;
and
against
it
,
black
and
patternlike
,
*NL*
loomed
the
gigantic
figure
of
the
colonel
on
a
gigantic
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
off
in
the
darkness
came
the
trampling
of
feet
.
The
youth
could
*NL*
occasionally
see
dark
shadows
that
moved
like
monsters
.
The
regiment
*NL*
stood
at
rest
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
.
The
youth
grew
impatient
.
It
*NL*
was
unendurable
the
way
these
affairs
were
managed
.
He
wondered
how
*NL*
long
they
were
to
be
kept
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
looked
all
about
him
and
pondered
upon
the
mystic
gloom
,
he
began
*NL*
to
believe
that
at
any
moment
the
ominous
distance
might
be
aflare
,
and
*NL*
the
rolling
crashes
of
an
engagement
come
to
his
ears
.
Staring
once
at
*NL*
the
red
eyes
across
the
river
,
he
conceived
them
to
be
growing
larger
,
*NL*
as
the
orbs
of
a
row
of
dragons
advancing
.
He
turned
toward
the
*NL*
colonel
and
saw
him
lift
his
gigantic
arm
and
calmly
stroke
his
*NL*
mustache
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
heard
from
along
the
road
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
*NL*
clatter
of
a
horse
's
galloping
hoofs
.
It
must
be
the
coming
of
orders
.
*NL*
He
bent
forward
,
scarce
breathing
.
The
exciting
clickety-click
,
as
it
*NL*
grew
louder
and
louder
,
seemed
to
be
beating
upon
his
soul
.
Presently
*NL*
a
horseman
with
jangling
equipment
drew
rein
before
the
colonel
of
the
*NL*
regiment
.
The
two
held
a
short
,
sharp-worded
conversation
.
The
men
in
*NL*
the
foremost
ranks
craned
their
necks
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
horseman
wheeled
his
animal
and
galloped
away
he
turned
to
shout
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
,
``
Do
n't
forget
that
box
of
cigars
!
''
The
colonel
*NL*
mumbled
in
reply
.
The
youth
wondered
what
a
box
of
cigars
had
to
do
*NL*
with
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
the
regiment
went
swinging
off
into
the
darkness
.
It
*NL*
was
now
like
one
of
those
moving
monsters
wending
with
many
feet
.
The
*NL*
air
was
heavy
,
and
cold
with
dew
.
A
mass
of
wet
grass
,
marched
upon
,
*NL*
rustled
like
silk
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
occasional
flash
and
glimmer
of
steel
from
the
backs
of
*NL*
all
these
huge
crawling
reptiles
.
From
the
road
came
creakings
and
*NL*
grumblings
as
some
surly
guns
were
dragged
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
stumbled
along
still
muttering
speculations
.
There
was
a
*NL*
subdued
debate
.
Once
a
man
fell
down
,
and
as
he
reached
for
his
rifle
*NL*
a
comrade
,
unseeing
,
trod
upon
his
hand
.
He
of
the
injured
fingers
*NL*
swore
bitterly
and
aloud
.
A
low
,
tittering
laugh
went
among
his
*NL*
fellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
they
passed
into
a
roadway
and
marched
forward
with
easy
*NL*
strides
.
A
dark
regiment
moved
before
them
,
and
from
behind
also
came
*NL*
the
tinkle
of
equipments
on
the
bodies
of
marching
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rushing
yellow
of
the
developing
day
went
on
behind
their
backs
.
*NL*
When
the
sunrays
at
last
struck
full
and
mellowingly
upon
the
earth
,
*NL*
the
youth
saw
that
the
landscape
was
streaked
with
two
long
,
thin
,
*NL*
black
columns
which
disappeared
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
in
front
and
*NL*
rearward
vanished
in
a
wood
.
They
were
like
two
serpents
crawling
from
*NL*
the
cavern
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
river
was
not
in
view
.
The
tall
soldier
burst
into
praises
of
what
*NL*
he
thought
to
be
his
powers
of
perception
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
tall
one
's
companions
cried
with
emphasis
that
they
,
too
,
*NL*
had
evolved
the
same
thing
,
and
they
congratulated
themselves
upon
it
.
*NL*
But
there
were
others
who
said
that
the
tall
one
's
plan
was
not
the
*NL*
true
one
at
all
.
They
persisted
with
other
theories
.
There
was
a
*NL*
vigorous
discussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
took
no
part
in
them
.
As
he
walked
along
in
careless
line
he
*NL*
was
engaged
with
his
own
eternal
debate
.
He
could
not
hinder
himself
*NL*
from
dwelling
upon
it
.
He
was
despondent
and
sullen
,
and
threw
*NL*
shifting
glances
about
him
.
He
looked
ahead
,
often
expecting
to
hear
*NL*
from
the
advance
the
rattle
of
firing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
long
serpents
crawled
slowly
from
hill
to
hill
without
bluster
*NL*
of
smoke
.
A
dun-colored
cloud
of
dust
floated
away
to
the
right
.
The
*NL*
sky
overhead
was
of
a
fairy
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
studied
the
faces
of
his
companions
,
ever
on
the
watch
to
*NL*
detect
kindred
emotions
.
He
suffered
disappointment
.
Some
ardor
of
*NL*
the
air
which
was
causing
the
veteran
commands
to
move
with
*NL*
glee
--
almost
with
song
--
had
infected
the
new
regiment
.
The
men
began
*NL*
to
speak
of
victory
as
of
a
thing
they
knew
.
Also
,
the
tall
soldier
*NL*
received
his
vindication
.
They
were
certainly
going
to
come
around
in
*NL*
behind
the
enemy
.
They
expressed
commiseration
for
that
part
of
the
*NL*
army
which
had
been
left
upon
the
river
bank
,
felicitating
themselves
*NL*
upon
being
a
part
of
a
blasting
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
considering
himself
as
separated
from
the
others
,
was
*NL*
saddened
by
the
blithe
and
merry
speeches
that
went
from
rank
to
rank
.
*NL*
The
company
wags
all
made
their
best
endeavors
.
The
regiment
tramped
*NL*
to
the
tune
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blatant
soldier
often
convulsed
whole
files
by
his
biting
sarcasms
*NL*
aimed
at
the
tall
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
not
long
before
all
the
men
seemed
to
forget
their
mission
.
*NL*
Whole
brigades
grinned
in
unison
,
and
regiments
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
rather
fat
soldier
attempted
to
pilfer
a
horse
from
a
dooryard
.
He
*NL*
planned
to
load
his
knap-sack
upon
it
.
He
was
escaping
with
his
prize
*NL*
when
a
young
girl
rushed
from
the
house
and
grabbed
the
animal
's
mane
.
*NL*
There
followed
a
wrangle
.
The
young
girl
,
with
pink
cheeks
and
shining
*NL*
eyes
,
stood
like
a
dauntless
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
observant
regiment
,
standing
at
rest
in
the
roadway
,
whooped
at
*NL*
once
,
and
entered
whole-souled
upon
the
side
of
the
maiden
.
The
men
*NL*
became
so
engrossed
in
this
affair
that
they
entirely
ceased
to
*NL*
remember
their
own
large
war
.
They
jeered
the
piratical
private
,
and
*NL*
called
attention
to
various
defects
in
his
personal
appearance
;
and
*NL*
they
were
wildly
enthusiastic
in
support
of
the
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
her
,
from
some
distance
,
came
bold
advice
.
``
Hit
him
with
a
stick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
crows
and
catcalls
showered
upon
him
when
he
retreated
*NL*
without
the
horse
.
The
regiment
rejoiced
at
his
downfall
.
Loud
and
*NL*
vociferous
congratulations
were
showered
upon
the
maiden
,
who
stood
*NL*
panting
and
regarding
the
troops
with
defiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nightfall
the
column
broke
into
regimental
pieces
,
and
the
fragments
*NL*
went
into
the
fields
to
camp
.
Tents
sprang
up
like
strange
plants
.
*NL*
Camp
fires
,
like
red
,
peculiar
blossoms
,
dotted
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
kept
from
intercourse
with
his
companions
as
much
as
*NL*
circumstances
would
allow
him
.
In
the
evening
he
wandered
a
few
paces
*NL*
into
the
gloom
.
From
this
little
distance
the
many
fires
,
with
the
*NL*
black
forms
of
men
passing
to
and
fro
before
the
crimson
rays
,
made
*NL*
weird
and
satanic
effects
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
down
in
the
grass
.
The
blades
pressed
tenderly
against
his
*NL*
cheek
.
The
moon
had
been
lighted
and
was
hung
in
a
treetop
.
The
liquid
*NL*
stillness
of
the
night
enveloping
him
made
him
feel
vast
pity
for
*NL*
himself
.
There
was
a
caress
in
the
soft
winds
;
and
the
whole
mood
of
*NL*
the
darkness
,
he
thought
,
was
one
of
sympathy
for
himself
in
his
*NL*
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wished
,
without
reserve
,
that
he
was
at
home
again
making
the
*NL*
endless
rounds
from
the
house
to
the
barn
,
from
the
barn
to
the
fields
,
*NL*
from
the
fields
to
the
barn
,
from
the
barn
to
the
house
.
He
remembered
*NL*
he
had
often
cursed
the
brindle
cow
and
her
mates
,
and
had
sometimes
*NL*
flung
milking
stools
.
But
,
from
his
present
point
of
view
,
there
was
a
*NL*
halo
of
happiness
about
each
of
their
heads
,
and
he
would
have
*NL*
sacrificed
all
the
brass
buttons
on
the
continent
to
have
been
enabled
*NL*
to
return
to
them
.
He
told
himself
that
he
was
not
formed
for
a
*NL*
soldier
.
And
he
mused
seriously
upon
the
radical
differences
between
*NL*
himself
and
those
men
who
were
dodging
imp-like
around
the
fires
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
mused
thus
he
heard
the
rustle
of
grass
,
and
,
upon
turning
his
*NL*
head
,
discovered
the
loud
soldier
.
He
called
out
,
``
Oh
,
Wilson
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
approached
and
looked
down
.
``
Why
,
hello
,
Henry
;
is
it
you
?
*NL*
What
you
doing
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thinking
,
''
said
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
sat
down
and
carefully
lighted
his
pipe
.
``
You
're
getting
*NL*
blue
,
my
boy
.
You
're
looking
thundering
peeked
.
What
the
dickens
is
*NL*
wrong
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
,
''
said
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
loud
soldier
launched
then
into
the
subject
of
the
anticipated
*NL*
fight
.
``
Oh
,
we
've
got
'em
now
!
''
As
he
spoke
his
boyish
face
was
*NL*
wreathed
in
a
gleeful
smile
,
and
his
voice
had
an
exultant
ring
.
``
We
've
*NL*
got
'em
now
.
At
last
,
by
the
eternal
thunders
,
we
'll
lick
'em
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
truth
was
known
,
''
he
added
,
more
soberly
,
``
THEY
'VE
licked
US
*NL*
about
every
clip
up
to
now
;
but
this
time
--
this
time
--
we
'll
lick
'em
*NL*
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
was
objecting
to
this
march
a
little
while
ago
,
''
said
*NL*
the
youth
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
was
n't
that
,
''
explained
the
other
.
``
I
do
n't
mind
marching
,
if
*NL*
there
's
going
to
be
fighting
at
the
end
of
it
.
What
I
hate
is
this
*NL*
getting
moved
here
and
moved
there
,
with
no
good
coming
of
it
,
as
far
*NL*
as
I
can
see
,
excepting
sore
feet
and
damned
short
rations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Jim
Conklin
says
we
'll
get
a
plenty
of
fighting
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
right
for
once
,
I
guess
,
though
I
ca
n't
see
how
it
come
.
This
*NL*
time
we
're
in
for
a
big
battle
,
and
we
've
got
the
best
end
of
it
,
*NL*
certain
sure
.
Gee
rod
!
how
we
will
thump
'em
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
arose
and
began
to
pace
to
and
fro
excitedly
.
The
thrill
of
his
*NL*
enthusiasm
made
him
walk
with
an
elastic
step
.
He
was
sprightly
,
*NL*
vigorous
,
fiery
in
his
belief
in
success
.
He
looked
into
the
future
*NL*
with
clear
,
proud
eye
,
and
he
swore
with
the
air
of
an
old
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
watched
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
.
When
he
finally
spoke
*NL*
his
voice
was
as
bitter
as
dregs
.
``
Oh
,
you
're
going
to
do
great
*NL*
things
,
I
s
`
pose
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
loud
soldier
blew
a
thoughtful
cloud
of
smoke
from
his
pipe
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
remarked
with
dignity
;
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
s
`
pose
I
'll
*NL*
do
as
well
as
the
rest
.
I
'm
going
to
try
like
thunder
.
''
He
evidently
*NL*
complimented
himself
upon
the
modesty
of
this
statement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
you
wo
n't
run
when
the
time
comes
?
''
asked
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
?
''
said
the
loud
one
;
``
run
?
--
of
course
not
!
''
He
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
continued
the
youth
,
``
lots
of
good-a
-
`
nough
men
have
thought
*NL*
they
was
going
to
do
great
things
before
the
fight
,
but
when
the
time
*NL*
come
they
skedaddled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
all
true
,
I
s
`
pose
,
''
replied
the
other
;
``
but
I
'm
not
going
*NL*
to
skedaddle
.
The
man
that
bets
on
my
running
will
lose
his
money
,
*NL*
that
's
all
.
''
He
nodded
confidently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shucks
!
''
said
the
youth
.
``
You
ai
n't
the
bravest
man
in
the
world
,
*NL*
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
ai
n't
,
''
exclaimed
the
loud
soldier
indignantly
;
``
and
I
did
n't
*NL*
say
I
was
the
bravest
man
in
the
world
,
neither
.
I
said
I
was
going
to
*NL*
do
my
share
of
fighting
--
that
's
what
I
said
.
And
I
am
,
too
.
Who
are
*NL*
you
,
anyhow
.
You
talk
as
if
you
thought
you
was
Napoleon
Bonaparte
.
''
*NL*
He
glared
at
the
youth
for
a
moment
,
and
then
strode
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
called
in
a
savage
voice
after
his
comrade
:
``
Well
,
you
*NL*
need
n't
git
mad
about
it
!
''
But
the
other
continued
on
his
way
and
made
*NL*
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
alone
in
space
when
his
injured
comrade
had
disappeared
.
His
*NL*
failure
to
discover
any
mite
of
resemblance
in
their
view
points
made
*NL*
him
more
miserable
than
before
.
No
one
seemed
to
be
wrestling
with
*NL*
such
a
terrific
personal
problem
.
He
was
a
mental
outcast
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
slowly
to
his
tent
and
stretched
himself
on
a
blanket
by
the
*NL*
side
of
the
snoring
tall
soldier
.
In
the
darkness
he
saw
visions
of
a
*NL*
thousand-tongued
fear
that
would
babble
at
his
back
and
cause
him
to
*NL*
flee
,
while
others
were
going
coolly
about
their
country
's
business
.
He
*NL*
admitted
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
cope
with
this
monster
.
He
felt
*NL*
that
every
nerve
in
his
body
would
be
an
ear
to
hear
the
voices
,
while
*NL*
other
men
would
remain
stolid
and
deaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
sweated
with
the
pain
of
these
thoughts
,
he
could
hear
low
,
*NL*
serene
sentences
.
``
I
'll
bid
five
.
''
``
Make
it
six
.
''
``
Seven
.
''
``
Seven
*NL*
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stared
at
the
red
,
shivering
reflection
of
a
fire
on
the
white
wall
*NL*
of
his
tent
until
,
exhausted
and
ill
from
the
monotony
of
his
*NL*
suffering
,
he
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
another
night
came
the
columns
,
changed
to
purple
streaks
,
filed
*NL*
across
two
pontoon
bridges
.
A
glaring
fire
wine-tinted
the
waters
of
*NL*
the
river
.
Its
rays
,
shining
upon
the
moving
masses
of
troops
,
brought
*NL*
forth
here
and
there
sudden
gleams
of
silver
or
gold
.
Upon
the
other
*NL*
shore
a
dark
and
mysterious
range
of
hills
was
curved
against
the
sky
.
*NL*
The
insect
voices
of
the
night
sang
solemnly
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
crossing
the
youth
assured
himself
that
at
any
moment
they
*NL*
might
be
suddenly
and
fearfully
assaulted
from
the
caves
of
the
*NL*
lowering
woods
.
He
kept
his
eyes
watchfully
upon
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
regiment
went
unmolested
to
a
camping
place
,
and
its
soldiers
*NL*
slept
the
brave
sleep
of
wearied
men
.
In
the
morning
they
were
routed
*NL*
out
with
early
energy
,
and
hustled
along
a
narrow
road
that
led
deep
*NL*
into
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
during
this
rapid
march
that
the
regiment
lost
many
of
the
marks
*NL*
of
a
new
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
had
begun
to
count
the
miles
upon
their
fingers
,
and
they
grew
*NL*
tired
.
``
Sore
feet
an
'
damned
short
rations
,
that
's
all
,
''
said
the
loud
*NL*
soldier
.
There
was
perspiration
and
grumblings
.
After
a
time
they
*NL*
began
to
shed
their
knapsacks
.
Some
tossed
them
unconcernedly
down
;
*NL*
others
hid
them
carefully
,
asserting
their
plans
to
return
for
them
at
*NL*
some
convenient
time
.
Men
extricated
themselves
from
thick
shirts
.
*NL*
Presently
few
carried
anything
but
their
necessary
clothing
,
blankets
,
*NL*
haversacks
,
canteens
,
and
arms
and
ammunition
.
``
You
can
now
eat
and
*NL*
shoot
,
''
said
the
tall
soldier
to
the
youth
.
``
That
's
all
you
want
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
sudden
change
from
the
ponderous
infantry
of
theory
to
the
*NL*
light
and
speedy
infantry
of
practice
.
The
regiment
,
relieved
of
a
*NL*
burden
,
received
a
new
impetus
.
But
there
was
much
loss
of
valuable
*NL*
knapsacks
,
and
,
on
the
whole
,
very
good
shirts
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
regiment
was
not
yet
veteranlike
in
appearance
.
Veteran
*NL*
regiments
in
the
army
were
likely
to
be
very
small
aggregations
of
men
.
*NL*
Once
,
when
the
command
had
first
come
to
the
field
,
some
perambulating
*NL*
veterans
,
noting
the
length
of
their
column
,
had
accosted
them
thus
:
*NL*
``
Hey
,
fellers
,
what
brigade
is
that
?
''
And
when
the
men
had
replied
*NL*
that
they
formed
a
regiment
and
not
a
brigade
,
the
older
soldiers
had
*NL*
laughed
,
and
said
,
``
O
Gawd
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Also
,
there
was
too
great
a
similarity
in
the
hats
.
The
hats
of
a
*NL*
regiment
should
properly
represent
the
history
of
headgear
for
a
period
*NL*
of
years
.
And
,
moreover
,
there
were
no
letters
of
faded
gold
speaking
*NL*
from
the
colors
.
They
were
new
and
beautiful
,
and
the
color
bearer
*NL*
habitually
oiled
the
pole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
army
again
sat
down
to
think
.
The
odor
of
the
peaceful
*NL*
pines
was
in
the
men
's
nostrils
.
The
sound
of
monotonous
axe
blows
*NL*
rang
through
the
forest
,
and
the
insects
,
nodding
upon
their
perches
,
*NL*
crooned
like
old
women
.
The
youth
returned
to
his
theory
of
a
blue
*NL*
demonstration
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
gray
dawn
,
however
,
he
was
kicked
in
the
leg
by
the
tall
soldier
,
*NL*
and
then
,
before
he
was
entirely
awake
,
he
found
himself
running
down
a
*NL*
wood
road
in
the
midst
of
men
who
were
panting
from
the
first
effects
*NL*
of
speed
.
His
canteen
banged
rhythmically
upon
his
thigh
,
and
his
*NL*
haversack
bobbed
softly
.
His
musket
bounced
a
trifle
from
his
shoulder
*NL*
at
each
stride
and
made
his
cap
feel
uncertain
upon
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hear
the
men
whisper
jerky
sentences
:
``
Say
--
what
's
all
*NL*
this
--
about
?
''
``
What
th
'
thunder
--
we
--
skedaddlin
'
this
way
fer
?
''
*NL*
``
Billie
--
keep
off
m
'
feet
.
Yeh
run
--
like
a
cow
.
''
And
the
loud
*NL*
soldier
's
shrill
voice
could
be
heard
:
``
What
th
'
devil
they
in
sich
a
*NL*
hurry
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
thought
the
damp
fog
of
early
morning
moved
from
the
rush
of
*NL*
a
great
body
of
troops
.
From
the
distance
came
a
sudden
spatter
of
*NL*
firing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
bewildered
.
As
he
ran
with
his
comrades
he
strenuously
tried
to
*NL*
think
,
but
all
he
knew
was
that
if
he
fell
down
those
coming
behind
*NL*
would
tread
upon
him
.
All
his
faculties
seemed
to
be
needed
to
guide
*NL*
him
over
and
past
obstructions
.
He
felt
carried
along
by
a
mob
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
spread
disclosing
rays
,
and
,
one
by
one
,
regiments
burst
into
*NL*
view
like
armed
men
just
born
of
the
earth
.
The
youth
perceived
that
*NL*
the
time
had
come
.
He
was
about
to
be
measured
.
For
a
moment
he
felt
*NL*
in
the
face
of
his
great
trial
like
a
babe
,
and
the
flesh
over
his
*NL*
heart
seemed
very
thin
.
He
seized
time
to
look
about
him
calculatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
instantly
saw
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
escape
from
*NL*
the
regiment
.
It
inclosed
him
.
And
there
were
iron
laws
of
tradition
*NL*
and
law
on
four
sides
.
He
was
in
a
moving
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
perceived
this
fact
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
never
wished
*NL*
to
come
to
the
war
.
He
had
not
enlisted
of
his
free
will
.
He
had
been
*NL*
dragged
by
the
merciless
government
.
And
now
they
were
taking
him
out
*NL*
to
be
slaughtered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
regiment
slid
down
a
bank
and
wallowed
across
a
little
stream
.
The
*NL*
mournful
current
moved
slowly
on
,
and
from
the
water
,
shaded
black
,
*NL*
some
white
bubble
eyes
looked
at
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
climbed
the
hill
on
the
farther
side
artillery
began
to
boom
.
*NL*
Here
the
youth
forgot
many
things
as
he
felt
a
sudden
impulse
of
*NL*
curiosity
.
He
scrambled
up
the
bank
with
a
speed
that
could
not
be
*NL*
exceeded
by
a
bloodthirsty
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
expected
a
battle
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
little
fields
girted
and
squeezed
by
a
forest
.
Spread
*NL*
over
the
grass
and
in
among
the
tree
trunks
,
he
could
see
knots
and
*NL*
waving
lines
of
skirmishers
who
were
running
hither
and
thither
and
*NL*
firing
at
the
landscape
.
A
dark
battle
line
lay
upon
a
sunstruck
*NL*
clearing
that
gleamed
orange
color
.
A
flag
fluttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
regiments
floundered
up
the
bank
.
The
brigade
was
formed
in
line
*NL*
of
battle
,
and
after
a
pause
started
slowly
through
the
woods
in
the
*NL*
rear
of
the
receding
skirmishers
,
who
were
continually
melting
into
the
*NL*
scene
to
appear
again
farther
on
.
They
were
always
busy
as
bees
,
*NL*
deeply
absorbed
in
their
little
combats
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
tried
to
observe
everything
.
He
did
not
use
care
to
avoid
*NL*
trees
and
branches
,
and
his
forgotten
feet
were
constantly
knocking
*NL*
against
stones
or
getting
entangled
in
briers
.
He
was
aware
that
these
*NL*
battalions
with
their
commotions
were
woven
red
and
startling
into
the
*NL*
gentle
fabric
of
softened
greens
and
browns
.
It
looked
to
be
a
wrong
*NL*
place
for
a
battle
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
skirmishers
in
advance
fascinated
him
.
Their
shots
into
thickets
*NL*
and
at
distant
and
prominent
trees
spoke
to
him
of
tragedies
--
hidden
,
*NL*
mysterious
,
solemn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
the
line
encountered
the
body
of
a
dead
soldier
.
He
lay
upon
his
*NL*
back
staring
at
the
sky
.
He
was
dressed
in
an
awkward
suit
of
yellowish
*NL*
brown
.
The
youth
could
see
that
the
soles
of
his
shoes
had
been
worn
*NL*
to
the
thinness
of
writing
paper
,
and
from
a
great
rent
in
one
the
dead
*NL*
foot
projected
piteously
.
And
it
was
as
if
fate
had
betrayed
the
*NL*
soldier
.
In
death
it
exposed
to
his
enemies
that
poverty
which
in
life
*NL*
he
had
perhaps
concealed
from
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ranks
opened
covertly
to
avoid
the
corpse
.
The
invulnerable
dead
*NL*
man
forced
a
way
for
himself
.
The
youth
looked
keenly
at
the
ashen
*NL*
face
.
The
wind
raised
the
tawny
beard
.
It
moved
as
if
a
hand
were
*NL*
stroking
it
.
He
vaguely
desired
to
walk
around
and
around
the
body
and
*NL*
stare
;
the
impulse
of
the
living
to
try
to
read
in
dead
eyes
the
answer
*NL*
to
the
Question
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
march
the
ardor
which
the
youth
had
acquired
when
out
of
*NL*
view
of
the
field
rapidly
faded
to
nothing
.
His
curiosity
was
quite
*NL*
easily
satisfied
.
If
an
intense
scene
had
caught
him
with
its
wild
*NL*
swing
as
he
came
to
the
top
of
the
bank
,
he
might
have
gone
roaring
on
.
*NL*
This
advance
upon
Nature
was
too
calm
.
He
had
opportunity
to
reflect
.
*NL*
He
had
time
in
which
to
wonder
about
himself
and
to
attempt
to
probe
*NL*
his
sensations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Absurd
ideas
took
hold
upon
him
.
He
thought
that
he
did
not
relish
the
*NL*
landscape
.
It
threatened
him
.
A
coldness
swept
over
his
back
,
and
it
*NL*
is
true
that
his
trousers
felt
to
him
that
they
were
no
fit
for
his
*NL*
legs
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
house
standing
placidly
in
distant
fields
had
to
him
an
ominous
look
.
*NL*
The
shadows
of
the
woods
were
formidable
.
He
was
certain
that
in
this
*NL*
vista
there
lurked
fierce-eyed
hosts
.
The
swift
thought
came
to
him
*NL*
that
the
generals
did
not
know
what
they
were
about
.
It
was
all
a
*NL*
trap
.
Suddenly
those
close
forests
would
bristle
with
rifle
barrels
.
*NL*
Ironlike
brigades
would
appear
in
the
rear
.
They
were
all
going
to
be
*NL*
sacrificed
.
The
generals
were
stupids
.
The
enemy
would
presently
*NL*
swallow
the
whole
command
.
He
glared
about
him
,
expecting
to
see
the
*NL*
stealthy
approach
of
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
that
he
must
break
from
the
ranks
and
harangue
his
comrades
.
*NL*
They
must
not
all
be
killed
like
pigs
;
and
he
was
sure
it
would
come
to
*NL*
pass
unless
they
were
informed
of
these
dangers
.
The
generals
were
*NL*
idiots
to
send
them
marching
into
a
regular
pen
.
There
was
but
one
*NL*
pair
of
eyes
in
the
corps
.
He
would
step
forth
and
make
a
speech
.
*NL*
Shrill
and
passionate
words
came
to
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
line
,
broken
into
moving
fragments
by
the
ground
,
went
calmly
on
*NL*
through
fields
and
woods
.
The
youth
looked
at
the
men
nearest
him
,
and
*NL*
saw
,
for
the
most
part
,
expressions
of
deep
interest
,
as
if
they
were
*NL*
investigating
something
that
had
fascinated
them
.
One
or
two
stepped
*NL*
with
overvaliant
airs
as
if
they
were
already
plunged
into
war
.
Others
*NL*
walked
as
upon
thin
ice
.
The
greater
part
of
the
untested
men
appeared
*NL*
quiet
and
absorbed
.
They
were
going
to
look
at
war
,
the
red
*NL*
animal
--
war
,
the
blood-swollen
god
.
And
they
were
deeply
engrossed
in
*NL*
this
march
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
looked
the
youth
gripped
his
outcry
at
his
throat
.
He
saw
that
*NL*
even
if
the
men
were
tottering
with
fear
they
would
laugh
at
his
*NL*
warning
.
They
would
jeer
him
,
and
,
if
practicable
,
pelt
him
with
*NL*
missiles
.
Admitting
that
he
might
be
wrong
,
a
frenzied
declamation
of
*NL*
the
kind
would
turn
him
into
a
worm
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
assumed
,
then
,
the
demeanor
of
one
who
knows
that
he
is
doomed
alone
*NL*
to
unwritten
responsibilities
.
He
lagged
,
with
tragic
glances
at
the
*NL*
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
surprised
presently
by
the
young
lieutenant
of
his
company
,
who
*NL*
began
heartily
to
beat
him
with
a
sword
,
calling
out
in
a
loud
and
*NL*
insolent
voice
:
``
Come
,
young
man
,
get
up
into
ranks
there
.
No
*NL*
skulking
'll
do
here
.
''
He
mended
his
pace
with
suitable
haste
.
And
he
*NL*
hated
the
lieutenant
,
who
had
no
appreciation
of
fine
minds
.
He
was
a
*NL*
mere
brute
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
the
brigade
was
halted
in
the
cathedral
light
of
a
forest
.
*NL*
The
busy
skirmishers
were
still
popping
.
Through
the
aisles
of
the
*NL*
wood
could
be
seen
the
floating
smoke
from
their
rifles
.
Sometimes
it
*NL*
went
up
in
little
balls
,
white
and
compact
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
halt
many
men
in
the
regiment
began
erecting
tiny
hills
in
*NL*
front
of
them
.
They
used
stones
,
sticks
,
earth
,
and
anything
they
*NL*
thought
might
turn
a
bullet
.
Some
built
comparatively
large
ones
,
*NL*
while
others
seemed
content
with
little
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
procedure
caused
a
discussion
among
the
men
.
Some
wished
to
fight
*NL*
like
duelists
,
believing
it
to
be
correct
to
stand
erect
and
be
,
from
*NL*
their
feet
to
their
foreheads
,
a
mark
.
They
said
they
scorned
the
*NL*
devices
of
the
cautious
.
But
the
others
scoffed
in
reply
,
and
pointed
*NL*
to
the
veterans
on
the
flanks
who
were
digging
at
the
ground
like
*NL*
terriers
.
In
a
short
time
there
was
quite
a
barricade
along
the
*NL*
regimental
fronts
.
Directly
,
however
,
they
were
ordered
to
withdraw
*NL*
from
that
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
astounded
the
youth
.
He
forgot
his
stewing
over
the
advance
*NL*
movement
.
``
Well
,
then
,
what
did
they
march
us
out
here
for
?
''
he
*NL*
demanded
of
the
tall
soldier
.
The
latter
with
calm
faith
began
a
heavy
*NL*
explanation
,
although
he
had
been
compelled
to
leave
a
little
*NL*
protection
of
stones
and
dirt
to
which
he
had
devoted
much
care
and
*NL*
skill
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
regiment
was
aligned
in
another
position
each
man
's
regard
for
*NL*
his
safety
caused
another
line
of
small
intrenchments
.
They
ate
their
*NL*
noon
meal
behind
a
third
one
.
They
were
moved
from
this
one
also
.
They
*NL*
were
marched
from
place
to
place
with
apparent
aimlessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
had
been
taught
that
a
man
became
another
thing
in
a
battle
.
*NL*
He
saw
his
salvation
in
such
a
change
.
Hence
this
waiting
was
an
*NL*
ordeal
to
him
.
He
was
in
a
fever
of
impatience
.
He
considered
that
*NL*
there
was
denoted
a
lack
of
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
generals
.
He
*NL*
began
to
complain
to
the
tall
soldier
.
``
I
ca
n't
stand
this
much
*NL*
longer
,
''
he
cried
.
``
I
do
n't
see
what
good
it
does
to
make
us
wear
out
*NL*
our
legs
for
nothin
'
.
''
He
wished
to
return
to
camp
,
knowing
that
this
*NL*
affair
was
a
blue
demonstration
;
or
else
to
go
into
a
battle
and
*NL*
discover
that
he
had
been
a
fool
in
his
doubts
,
and
was
,
in
truth
,
a
*NL*
man
of
traditional
courage
.
The
strain
of
present
circumstances
he
felt
*NL*
to
be
intolerable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
philosophical
tall
soldier
measured
a
sandwich
of
cracker
and
pork
*NL*
and
swallowed
it
in
a
nonchalant
manner
.
``
Oh
,
I
suppose
we
must
go
*NL*
reconnoitering
around
the
country
jest
to
keep
'em
from
getting
too
*NL*
close
,
or
to
develop
'em
,
or
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh
!
''
said
the
loud
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
cried
the
youth
,
still
fidgeting
,
``
I
'd
rather
do
anything
`
most
*NL*
than
go
tramping
`
round
the
country
all
day
doing
no
good
to
nobody
and
*NL*
jest
tiring
ourselves
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
would
I
,
''
said
the
loud
soldier
.
``
It
ai
n't
right
.
I
tell
you
if
*NL*
anybody
with
any
sense
was
a-runnin
'
this
army
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shut
up
!
''
roared
the
tall
private
.
``
You
little
fool
.
You
little
*NL*
damn
'
cuss
.
You
ai
n't
had
that
there
coat
and
them
pants
on
for
six
*NL*
months
,
and
yet
you
talk
as
if
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
wanta
do
some
fighting
anyway
,
''
interrupted
the
other
.
``
I
*NL*
did
n't
come
here
to
walk
.
I
could
`
ave
walked
to
home
--
`
round
an
'
*NL*
`
round
the
barn
,
if
I
jest
wanted
to
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
one
,
red-faced
,
swallowed
another
sandwich
as
if
taking
poison
*NL*
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
gradually
,
as
he
chewed
,
his
face
became
again
quiet
and
contented
.
*NL*
He
could
not
rage
in
fierce
argument
in
the
presence
of
such
*NL*
sandwiches
.
During
his
meals
he
always
wore
an
air
of
blissful
*NL*
contemplation
of
the
food
he
had
swallowed
.
His
spirit
seemed
then
to
*NL*
be
communing
with
the
viands
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
accepted
new
environment
and
circumstance
with
great
coolness
,
*NL*
eating
from
his
haversack
at
every
opportunity
.
On
the
march
he
went
*NL*
along
with
the
stride
of
a
hunter
,
objecting
to
neither
gait
nor
*NL*
distance
.
And
he
had
not
raised
his
voice
when
he
had
been
ordered
*NL*
away
from
three
little
protective
piles
of
earth
and
stone
,
each
of
*NL*
which
had
been
an
engineering
feat
worthy
of
being
made
sacred
to
the
*NL*
name
of
his
grandmother
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
the
regiment
went
out
over
the
same
ground
it
had
*NL*
taken
in
the
morning
.
The
landscape
then
ceased
to
threaten
the
youth
.
*NL*
He
had
been
close
to
it
and
become
familiar
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
however
,
they
began
to
pass
into
a
new
region
,
his
old
fears
of
*NL*
stupidity
and
incompetence
reassailed
him
,
but
this
time
he
doggedly
*NL*
let
them
babble
.
He
was
occupied
with
his
problem
,
and
in
his
*NL*
desperation
he
concluded
that
the
stupidity
did
not
greatly
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
thought
he
had
concluded
that
it
would
be
better
to
get
killed
*NL*
directly
and
end
his
troubles
.
Regarding
death
thus
out
of
the
corner
*NL*
of
his
eye
,
he
conceived
it
to
be
nothing
but
rest
,
and
he
was
filled
*NL*
with
a
momentary
astonishment
that
he
should
have
made
an
extraordinary
*NL*
commotion
over
the
mere
matter
of
getting
killed
.
He
would
die
;
he
*NL*
would
go
to
some
place
where
he
would
be
understood
.
It
was
useless
to
*NL*
expect
appreciation
of
his
profound
and
fine
senses
from
such
men
as
*NL*
the
lieutenant
.
He
must
look
to
the
grave
for
comprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
skirmish
fire
increased
to
a
long
chattering
sound
.
With
it
was
*NL*
mingled
far-away
cheering
.
A
battery
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Directly
the
youth
would
see
the
skirmishers
running
.
They
were
*NL*
pursued
by
the
sound
of
musketry
fire
.
After
a
time
the
hot
,
dangerous
*NL*
flashes
of
the
rifles
were
visible
.
Smoke
clouds
went
slowly
and
*NL*
insolently
across
the
fields
like
observant
phantoms
.
The
din
became
*NL*
crescendo
,
like
the
roar
of
an
oncoming
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
brigade
ahead
of
them
and
on
the
right
went
into
action
with
a
*NL*
rending
roar
.
It
was
as
if
it
had
exploded
.
And
thereafter
it
lay
*NL*
stretched
in
the
distance
behind
a
long
gray
wall
,
that
one
was
obliged
*NL*
to
look
twice
at
to
make
sure
that
it
was
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
forgetting
his
neat
plan
of
getting
killed
,
gazed
spell
*NL*
bound
.
His
eyes
grew
wide
and
busy
with
the
action
of
the
scene
.
His
*NL*
mouth
was
a
little
ways
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
a
sudden
he
felt
a
heavy
and
sad
hand
laid
upon
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
Awakening
from
his
trance
of
observation
he
turned
and
beheld
the
loud
*NL*
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
my
first
and
last
battle
,
old
boy
,
''
said
the
latter
,
with
intense
*NL*
gloom
.
He
was
quite
pale
and
his
girlish
lip
was
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
''
murmured
the
youth
in
great
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
my
first
and
last
battle
,
old
boy
,
''
continued
the
loud
soldier
.
*NL*
``
Something
tells
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
gone
coon
this
first
time
and
--
and
I
w-want
you
to
take
these
*NL*
here
things
--
to
--
my
--
folks
.
''
He
ended
in
a
quavering
sob
of
pity
for
*NL*
himself
.
He
handed
the
youth
a
little
packet
done
up
in
a
yellow
*NL*
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
the
devil
--
''
began
the
youth
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
other
gave
him
a
glance
as
from
the
depths
of
a
tomb
,
and
*NL*
raised
his
limp
hand
in
a
prophetic
manner
and
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brigade
was
halted
in
the
fringe
of
a
grove
.
The
men
crouched
*NL*
among
the
trees
and
pointed
their
restless
guns
out
at
the
fields
.
They
*NL*
tried
to
look
beyond
the
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
this
haze
they
could
see
running
men
.
Some
shouted
information
*NL*
and
gestured
as
they
hurried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
of
the
new
regiment
watched
and
listened
eagerly
,
while
their
*NL*
tongues
ran
on
in
gossip
of
the
battle
.
They
mouthed
rumors
that
had
*NL*
flown
like
birds
out
of
the
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

say

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
din
in
front
swelled
to
a
tremendous
chorus
.
The
youth
and
his
*NL*
fellows
were
frozen
to
silence
.
They
could
see
a
flag
that
tossed
in
*NL*
the
smoke
angrily
.
Near
it
were
the
blurred
and
agitated
forms
of
*NL*
troops
.
There
came
a
turbulent
stream
of
men
across
the
fields
.
A
*NL*
battery
changing
position
at
a
frantic
gallop
scattered
the
stragglers
*NL*
right
and
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
shell
screaming
like
a
storm
banshee
went
over
the
huddled
heads
of
*NL*
the
reserves
.
It
landed
in
the
grove
,
and
exploding
redly
flung
the
*NL*
brown
earth
.
There
was
a
little
shower
of
pine
needles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bullets
began
to
whistle
among
the
branches
and
nip
at
the
trees
.
Twigs
*NL*
and
leaves
came
sailing
down
.
It
was
as
if
a
thousand
axes
,
wee
and
*NL*
invisible
,
were
being
wielded
.
Many
of
the
men
were
constantly
dodging
*NL*
and
ducking
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
of
the
youth
's
company
was
shot
in
the
hand
.
He
began
*NL*
to
swear
so
wondrously
that
a
nervous
laugh
went
along
the
regimental
*NL*
line
.
The
officer
's
profanity
sounded
conventional
.
It
relieved
the
*NL*
tightened
senses
of
the
new
men
.
It
was
as
if
he
had
hit
his
fingers
*NL*
with
a
tack
hammer
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
the
wounded
member
carefully
away
from
his
side
so
that
the
*NL*
blood
would
not
drip
upon
his
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
of
the
company
,
tucking
his
sword
under
his
arm
,
produced
a
*NL*
handkerchief
and
began
to
bind
with
it
the
lieutenant
's
wound
.
And
they
*NL*
disputed
as
to
how
the
binding
should
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
battle
flag
in
the
distance
jerked
about
madly
.
It
seemed
to
be
*NL*
struggling
to
free
itself
from
an
agony
.
The
billowing
smoke
was
*NL*
filled
with
horizontal
flashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
running
swiftly
emerged
from
it
.
They
grew
in
numbers
until
it
was
*NL*
seen
that
the
whole
command
was
fleeing
.
The
flag
suddenly
sank
down
*NL*
as
if
dying
.
Its
motion
as
it
fell
was
a
gesture
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wild
yells
came
from
behind
the
walls
of
smoke
.
A
sketch
in
gray
and
*NL*
red
dissolved
into
a
moblike
body
of
men
who
galloped
like
wild
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
veteran
regiments
on
the
right
and
left
of
the
304th
immediately
*NL*
began
to
jeer
.
With
the
passionate
song
of
the
bullets
and
the
banshee
*NL*
shrieks
of
shells
were
mingled
loud
catcalls
and
bits
of
facetious
*NL*
advice
concerning
places
of
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
new
regiment
was
breathless
with
horror
.
``
Gawd
!
Saunders
's
*NL*
got
crushed
!
''
whispered
the
man
at
the
youth
's
elbow
.
They
shrank
back
*NL*
and
crouched
as
if
compelled
to
await
a
flood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
shot
a
swift
glance
along
the
blue
ranks
of
the
regiment
.
The
*NL*
profiles
were
motionless
,
carven
;
and
afterward
he
remembered
that
the
*NL*
color
sergeant
was
standing
with
his
legs
apart
,
as
if
he
expected
to
*NL*
be
pushed
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
throng
went
whirling
around
the
flank
.
Here
and
there
*NL*
were
officers
carried
along
on
the
stream
like
exasperated
chips
.
They
*NL*
were
striking
about
them
with
their
swords
and
with
their
left
fists
,
*NL*
punching
every
head
they
could
reach
.
They
cursed
like
highwaymen
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mounted
officer
displayed
the
furious
anger
of
a
spoiled
child
.
He
*NL*
raged
with
his
head
,
his
arms
,
and
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
,
the
commander
of
the
brigade
,
was
galloping
about
bawling
.
His
*NL*
hat
was
gone
and
his
clothes
were
awry
.
He
resembled
a
man
who
has
*NL*
come
from
bed
to
go
to
a
fire
.
The
hoofs
of
his
horse
often
threatened
*NL*
the
heads
of
the
running
men
,
but
they
scampered
with
singular
fortune
.
*NL*
In
this
rush
they
were
apparently
all
deaf
and
blind
.
They
heeded
not
*NL*
the
largest
and
longest
of
the
oaths
that
were
thrown
at
them
from
all
*NL*
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frequently
over
this
tumult
could
be
heard
the
grim
jokes
of
the
*NL*
critical
veterans
;
but
the
retreating
men
apparently
were
not
even
*NL*
conscious
of
the
presence
of
an
audience
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
battle
reflection
that
shone
for
an
instant
in
the
faces
on
the
mad
*NL*
current
made
the
youth
feel
that
forceful
hands
from
heaven
would
not
*NL*
have
been
able
to
have
held
him
in
place
if
he
could
have
got
*NL*
intelligent
control
of
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
appalling
imprint
upon
these
faces
.
The
struggle
in
the
*NL*
smoke
had
pictured
an
exaggeration
of
itself
on
the
bleached
cheeks
and
*NL*
in
the
eyes
wild
with
one
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
of
this
stampede
exerted
a
floodlike
force
that
seemed
able
*NL*
to
drag
sticks
and
stones
and
men
from
the
ground
.
They
of
the
*NL*
reserves
had
to
hold
on
.
They
grew
pale
and
firm
,
and
red
and
quaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
achieved
one
little
thought
in
the
midst
of
this
chaos
.
The
*NL*
composite
monster
which
had
caused
the
other
troops
to
flee
had
not
*NL*
then
appeared
.
He
resolved
to
get
a
view
of
it
,
and
then
,
he
thought
*NL*
he
might
very
likely
run
better
than
the
best
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
V
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
moments
of
waiting
.
The
youth
thought
of
the
village
street
*NL*
at
home
before
the
arrival
of
the
circus
parade
on
a
day
in
the
spring
.
*NL*
He
remembered
how
he
had
stood
,
a
small
,
thrillful
boy
,
prepared
to
*NL*
follow
the
dingy
lady
upon
the
white
horse
,
or
the
band
in
its
faded
*NL*
chariot
.
He
saw
the
yellow
road
,
the
lines
of
expectant
people
,
and
*NL*
the
sober
houses
.
He
particularly
remembered
an
old
fellow
who
used
to
*NL*
sit
upon
a
cracker
box
in
front
of
the
store
and
feign
to
despise
such
*NL*
exhibitions
.
A
thousand
details
of
color
and
form
surged
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
The
old
fellow
upon
the
cracker
box
appeared
in
middle
prominence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
cried
,
``
Here
they
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
rustling
and
muttering
among
the
men
.
They
displayed
a
*NL*
feverish
desire
to
have
every
possible
cartridge
ready
to
their
hands
.
*NL*
The
boxes
were
pulled
around
into
various
positions
,
and
adjusted
with
*NL*
great
care
.
It
was
as
if
seven
hundred
new
bonnets
were
being
tried
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
soldier
,
having
prepared
his
rifle
,
produced
a
red
*NL*
handkerchief
of
some
kind
.
He
was
engaged
in
knitting
it
about
his
*NL*
throat
with
exquisite
attention
to
its
position
,
when
the
cry
was
*NL*
repeated
up
and
down
the
line
in
a
muffled
roar
of
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
they
come
!
Here
they
come
!
''
Gun
locks
clicked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Across
the
smoke-infested
fields
came
a
brown
swarm
of
running
men
who
*NL*
were
giving
shrill
yells
.
They
came
on
,
stooping
and
swinging
their
*NL*
rifles
at
all
angles
.
A
flag
,
tilted
forward
,
sped
near
the
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
caught
sight
of
them
the
youth
was
momentarily
startled
by
a
*NL*
thought
that
perhaps
his
gun
was
not
loaded
.
He
stood
trying
to
rally
*NL*
his
faltering
intellect
so
that
he
might
recollect
the
moment
when
he
*NL*
had
loaded
,
but
he
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hatless
general
pulled
his
dripping
horse
to
a
stand
near
the
colonel
*NL*
of
the
304th
.
He
shook
his
fist
in
the
other
's
face
.
``
You
've
got
to
*NL*
hold
'em
back
!
''
he
shouted
,
savagely
;
``
you
've
got
to
hold
'em
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
agitation
the
colonel
began
to
stammer
.
``
A-all
r-right
,
General
,
*NL*
all
right
,
by
Gawd
!
We
--
we
'll
do
our
--
we-we
'll
d-d-do
--
do
our
best
,
*NL*
General
.
''
The
general
made
a
passionate
gesture
and
galloped
away
.
The
*NL*
colonel
,
perchance
to
relieve
his
feelings
,
began
to
scold
like
a
wet
*NL*
parrot
.
The
youth
,
turning
swiftly
to
make
sure
that
the
rear
was
*NL*
unmolested
,
saw
the
commander
regarding
his
men
in
a
highly
regretful
*NL*
manner
,
as
if
he
regretted
above
everything
his
association
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
at
the
youth
's
elbow
was
mumbling
,
as
if
to
himself
:
``
Oh
,
we
*NL*
're
in
for
it
now
!
oh
,
we
're
in
for
it
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
of
the
company
had
been
pacing
excitedly
to
and
fro
in
the
*NL*
rear
.
He
coaxed
in
schoolmistress
fashion
,
as
to
a
congregation
of
*NL*
boys
with
primers
.
His
talk
was
an
endless
repetition
.
``
Reserve
your
*NL*
fire
,
boys
--
do
n't
shoot
till
I
tell
you
--
save
your
fire
--
wait
till
they
*NL*
get
close
up
--
do
n't
be
damned
fools
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perspiration
streamed
down
the
youth
's
face
,
which
was
soiled
like
that
*NL*
of
a
weeping
urchin
.
He
frequently
,
with
a
nervous
movement
,
wiped
his
*NL*
eyes
with
his
coat
sleeve
.
His
mouth
was
still
a
little
ways
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
the
one
glance
at
the
foe-swarming
field
in
front
of
him
,
and
*NL*
instantly
ceased
to
debate
the
question
of
his
piece
being
loaded
.
*NL*
Before
he
was
ready
to
begin
--
before
he
had
announced
to
himself
that
*NL*
he
was
about
to
fight
--
he
threw
the
obedient
,
well-balanced
rifle
into
*NL*
position
and
fired
a
first
wild
shot
.
Directly
he
was
working
at
his
*NL*
weapon
like
an
automatic
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
lost
concern
for
himself
,
and
forgot
to
look
at
a
menacing
*NL*
fate
.
He
became
not
a
man
but
a
member
.
He
felt
that
something
of
*NL*
which
he
was
a
part
--
a
regiment
,
an
army
,
a
cause
,
or
a
country
--
was
in
*NL*
a
crisis
.
He
was
welded
into
a
common
personality
which
was
dominated
*NL*
by
a
single
desire
.
For
some
moments
he
could
not
flee
no
more
than
a
*NL*
little
finger
can
commit
a
revolution
from
a
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
had
thought
the
regiment
was
about
to
be
annihilated
perhaps
he
*NL*
could
have
amputated
himself
from
it
.
But
its
noise
gave
him
*NL*
assurance
.
The
regiment
was
like
a
firework
that
,
once
ignited
,
*NL*
proceeds
superior
to
circumstances
until
its
blazing
vitality
fades
.
It
*NL*
wheezed
and
banged
with
a
mighty
power
.
He
pictured
the
ground
before
*NL*
it
as
strewn
with
the
discomfited
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
consciousness
always
of
the
presence
of
his
comrades
about
*NL*
him
.
He
felt
the
subtle
battle
brotherhood
more
potent
even
than
the
*NL*
cause
for
which
they
were
fighting
.
It
was
a
mysterious
fraternity
*NL*
born
of
the
smoke
and
danger
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
at
a
task
.
He
was
like
a
carpenter
who
has
made
many
boxes
,
*NL*
making
still
another
box
,
only
there
was
furious
haste
in
his
*NL*
movements
.
He
,
in
his
thought
,
was
careering
off
in
other
places
,
even
*NL*
as
the
carpenter
who
as
he
works
whistles
and
thinks
of
his
friend
or
*NL*
his
enemy
,
his
home
or
a
saloon
.
And
these
jolted
dreams
were
never
*NL*
perfect
to
him
afterward
,
but
remained
a
mass
of
blurred
shapes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
he
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
the
war
atmosphere
--
a
*NL*
blistering
sweat
,
a
sensation
that
his
eyeballs
were
about
to
crack
*NL*
like
hot
stones
.
A
burning
roar
filled
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Following
this
came
a
red
rage
.
He
developed
the
acute
exasperation
of
*NL*
a
pestered
animal
,
a
well-meaning
cow
worried
by
dogs
.
He
had
a
mad
*NL*
feeling
against
his
rifle
,
which
could
only
be
used
against
one
life
at
*NL*
a
time
.
He
wished
to
rush
forward
and
strangle
with
his
fingers
.
He
*NL*
craved
a
power
that
would
enable
him
to
make
a
world-sweeping
gesture
*NL*
and
brush
all
back
.
His
impotency
appeared
to
him
,
and
made
his
rage
*NL*
into
that
of
a
driven
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buried
in
the
smoke
of
many
rifles
his
anger
was
directed
not
so
much
*NL*
against
the
men
whom
he
knew
were
rushing
toward
him
as
against
the
*NL*
swirling
battle
phantoms
which
were
choking
him
,
stuffing
their
smoke
*NL*
robes
down
his
parched
throat
.
He
fought
frantically
for
respite
for
*NL*
his
senses
,
for
air
,
as
a
babe
being
smothered
attacks
the
deadly
*NL*
blankets
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
blare
of
heated
rage
mingled
with
a
certain
expression
of
*NL*
intentness
on
all
faces
.
Many
of
the
men
were
making
low-toned
noises
*NL*
with
their
mouths
,
and
these
subdued
cheers
,
snarls
,
imprecations
,
*NL*
prayers
,
made
a
wild
,
barbaric
song
that
went
as
an
undercurrent
of
*NL*
sound
,
strange
and
chantlike
with
the
resounding
chords
of
the
war
*NL*
march
.
The
man
at
the
youth
's
elbow
was
babbling
.
In
it
there
was
*NL*
something
soft
and
tender
like
the
monologue
of
a
babe
.
The
tall
*NL*
soldier
was
swearing
in
a
loud
voice
.
From
his
lips
came
a
black
*NL*
procession
of
curious
oaths
.
Of
a
sudden
another
broke
out
in
a
*NL*
querulous
way
like
a
man
who
has
mislaid
his
hat
.
``
Well
,
why
do
n't
*NL*
they
support
us
?
Why
do
n't
they
send
supports
?
Do
they
think

*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
in
his
battle
sleep
heard
this
as
one
who
dozes
hears
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
singular
absence
of
heroic
poses
.
The
men
bending
and
*NL*
surging
in
their
haste
and
rage
were
in
every
impossible
attitude
.
The
*NL*
steel
ramrods
clanked
and
clanged
with
incessant
din
as
the
men
pounded
*NL*
them
furiously
into
the
hot
rifle
barrels
.
The
flaps
of
the
cartridge
*NL*
boxes
were
all
unfastened
,
and
bobbed
idiotically
with
each
movement
.
*NL*
The
rifles
,
once
loaded
,
were
jerked
to
the
shoulder
and
fired
without
*NL*
apparent
aim
into
the
smoke
or
at
one
of
the
blurred
and
shifting
forms
*NL*
which
upon
the
field
before
the
regiment
had
been
growing
larger
and
*NL*
larger
like
puppets
under
a
magician
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officers
,
at
their
intervals
,
rearward
,
neglected
to
stand
in
*NL*
picturesque
attitudes
.
They
were
bobbing
to
and
fro
roaring
directions
*NL*
and
encouragements
.
The
dimensions
of
their
howls
were
extraordinary
.
*NL*
They
expended
their
lungs
with
prodigal
wills
.
And
often
they
nearly
*NL*
stood
upon
their
heads
in
their
anxiety
to
observe
the
enemy
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
tumbling
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
of
the
youth
's
company
had
encountered
a
soldier
who
had
*NL*
fled
screaming
at
the
first
volley
of
his
comrades
.
Behind
the
lines
*NL*
these
two
were
acting
a
little
isolated
scene
.
The
man
was
blubbering
*NL*
and
staring
with
sheeplike
eyes
at
the
lieutenant
,
who
had
seized
him
*NL*
by
the
collar
and
was
pommeling
him
.
He
drove
him
back
into
the
ranks
*NL*
with
many
blows
.
The
soldier
went
mechanically
,
dully
,
with
his
*NL*
animal-like
eyes
upon
the
officer
.
Perhaps
there
was
to
him
a
divinity
*NL*
expressed
in
the
voice
of
the
other
--
stern
,
hard
,
with
no
reflection
of
*NL*
fear
in
it
.
He
tried
to
reload
his
gun
,
but
his
shaking
hands
*NL*
prevented
.
The
lieutenant
was
obliged
to
assist
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
dropped
here
and
there
like
bundles
.
The
captain
of
the
youth
's
*NL*
company
had
been
killed
in
an
early
part
of
the
action
.
His
body
lay
*NL*
stretched
out
in
the
position
of
a
tired
man
resting
,
but
upon
his
face
*NL*
there
was
an
astonished
and
sorrowful
look
,
as
if
he
thought
some
*NL*
friend
had
done
him
an
ill
turn
.
The
babbling
man
was
grazed
by
a
shot
*NL*
that
made
the
blood
stream
widely
down
his
face
.
He
clapped
both
hands
*NL*
to
his
head
.
``
Oh
!
''
he
said
,
and
ran
.
Another
grunted
suddenly
as
if
*NL*
he
had
been
struck
by
a
club
in
the
stomach
.
He
sat
down
and
gazed
*NL*
ruefully
.
In
his
eyes
there
was
mute
,
indefinite
reproach
.
Farther
up
*NL*
the
line
a
man
,
standing
behind
a
tree
,
had
had
his
knee
joint
*NL*
splintered
by
a
ball
.
Immediately
he
had
dropped
his
rifle
and
gripped
*NL*
the
tree
with
both
arms
.
And
there
he
remained
,
clinging
desperately
*NL*
and
crying
for
assistance
that
he
might
withdraw
his
hold
upon
the
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
an
exultant
yell
went
along
the
quivering
line
.
The
firing
*NL*
dwindled
from
an
uproar
to
a
last
vindictive
popping
.
As
the
smoke
*NL*
slowly
eddied
away
,
the
youth
saw
that
the
charge
had
been
repulsed
.
*NL*
The
enemy
were
scattered
into
reluctant
groups
.
He
saw
a
man
climb
to
*NL*
the
top
of
the
fence
,
straddle
the
rail
,
and
fire
a
parting
shot
.
The
*NL*
waves
had
receded
,
leaving
bits
of
dark
debris
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
in
the
regiment
began
to
whoop
frenziedly
.
Many
were
silent
.
*NL*
Apparently
they
were
trying
to
contemplate
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
fever
had
left
his
veins
,
the
youth
thought
that
at
last
he
*NL*
was
going
to
suffocate
.
He
became
aware
of
the
foul
atmosphere
in
which
*NL*
he
had
been
struggling
.
He
was
grimy
and
dripping
like
a
laborer
in
a
*NL*
foundry
.
He
grasped
his
canteen
and
took
a
long
swallow
of
the
warmed
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sentence
with
variations
went
up
and
down
the
line
.
``
Well
,
we
've
*NL*
helt
'em
back
.
We
've
helt
'em
back
;
derned
if
we
have
n't
.
''
The
men
*NL*
said
it
blissfully
,
leering
at
each
other
with
dirty
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
turned
to
look
behind
him
and
off
to
the
right
and
off
to
the
*NL*
left
.
He
experienced
the
joy
of
a
man
who
at
last
finds
leisure
in
*NL*
which
to
look
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
foot
there
were
a
few
ghastly
forms
motionless
.
They
lay
twisted
*NL*
in
fantastic
contortions
.
Arms
were
bent
and
heads
were
turned
in
*NL*
incredible
ways
.
It
seemed
that
the
dead
men
must
have
fallen
from
*NL*
some
great
height
to
get
into
such
positions
.
They
looked
to
be
dumped
*NL*
out
upon
the
ground
from
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
position
in
the
rear
of
the
grove
a
battery
was
throwing
shells
*NL*
over
it
.
The
flash
of
the
guns
startled
the
youth
at
first
.
He
*NL*
thought
they
were
aimed
directly
at
him
.
Through
the
trees
he
watched
*NL*
the
black
figures
of
the
gunners
as
they
worked
swiftly
and
intently
.
*NL*
Their
labor
seemed
a
complicated
thing
.
He
wondered
how
they
could
*NL*
remember
its
formula
in
the
midst
of
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guns
squatted
in
a
row
like
savage
chiefs
.
They
argued
with
abrupt
*NL*
violence
.
It
was
a
grim
pow-wow
.
Their
busy
servants
ran
hither
and
*NL*
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
procession
of
wounded
men
were
going
drearily
toward
the
rear
.
*NL*
It
was
a
flow
of
blood
from
the
torn
body
of
the
brigade
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
right
and
to
the
left
were
the
dark
lines
of
other
troops
.
Far
*NL*
in
front
he
thought
he
could
see
lighter
masses
protruding
in
points
*NL*
from
the
forest
.
They
were
suggestive
of
unnumbered
thousands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
saw
a
tiny
battery
go
dashing
along
the
line
of
the
horizon
.
*NL*
The
tiny
riders
were
beating
the
tiny
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
sloping
hill
came
the
sound
of
cheerings
and
clashes
.
Smoke
*NL*
welled
slowly
through
the
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Batteries
were
speaking
with
thunderous
oratorical
effort
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
were
flags
,
the
red
in
the
stripes
dominating
.
They
splashed
*NL*
bits
of
warm
color
upon
the
dark
lines
of
troops
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
felt
the
old
thrill
at
the
sight
of
the
emblem
.
They
were
*NL*
like
beautiful
birds
strangely
undaunted
in
a
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
listened
to
the
din
from
the
hillside
,
to
a
deep
pulsating
*NL*
thunder
that
came
from
afar
to
the
left
,
and
to
the
lesser
clamors
*NL*
which
came
from
many
directions
,
it
occurred
to
him
that
they
were
*NL*
fighting
,
too
,
over
there
,
and
over
there
,
and
over
there
.
Heretofore
*NL*
he
had
supposed
that
all
the
battle
was
directly
under
his
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
gazed
around
him
the
youth
felt
a
flash
of
astonishment
at
the
*NL*
blue
,
pure
sky
and
the
sun
gleamings
on
the
trees
and
fields
.
It
was
*NL*
surprising
that
Nature
had
gone
tranquilly
on
with
her
golden
process
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
so
much
devilment
.

CHAPTER
VI
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
awakened
slowly
.
He
came
gradually
back
to
a
position
from
*NL*
which
he
could
regard
himself
.
For
moments
he
had
been
scrutinizing
*NL*
his
person
in
a
dazed
way
as
if
he
had
never
before
seen
himself
.
Then
*NL*
he
picked
up
his
cap
from
the
ground
.
He
wriggled
in
his
jacket
to
*NL*
make
a
more
comfortable
fit
,
and
kneeling
relaced
his
shoe
.
He
*NL*
thoughtfully
mopped
his
reeking
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
was
all
over
at
last
!
The
supreme
trial
had
been
passed
.
The
*NL*
red
,
formidable
difficulties
of
war
had
been
vanquished
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
into
an
ecstasy
of
self-satisfaction
.
He
had
the
most
*NL*
delightful
sensations
of
his
life
.
Standing
as
if
apart
from
himself
,
*NL*
he
viewed
that
last
scene
.
He
perceived
that
the
man
who
had
fought
*NL*
thus
was
magnificent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
he
was
a
fine
fellow
.
He
saw
himself
even
with
those
*NL*
ideals
which
he
had
considered
as
far
beyond
him
.
He
smiled
in
deep
*NL*
gratification
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
his
fellows
he
beamed
tenderness
and
good
will
.
``
Gee
!
ai
n't
it
*NL*
hot
,
hey
?
''
he
said
affably
to
a
man
who
was
polishing
his
streaming
*NL*
face
with
his
coat
sleeves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
!
''
said
the
other
,
grinning
sociably
.
``
I
never
seen
sech
dumb
*NL*
hotness
.
''
He
sprawled
out
luxuriously
on
the
ground
.
``
Gee
,
yes
!
An
'
*NL*
I
hope
we
do
n't
have
no
more
fightin
'
till
a
week
from
Monday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
handshakings
and
deep
speeches
with
men
whose
features
*NL*
were
familiar
,
but
with
whom
the
youth
now
felt
the
bonds
of
tied
*NL*
hearts
.
He
helped
a
cursing
comrade
to
bind
up
a
wound
of
the
shin
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
of
a
sudden
,
cries
of
amazement
broke
out
along
the
ranks
of
the
*NL*
new
regiment
.
``
Here
they
come
ag
`
in
!
Here
they
come
ag
`
in
!
''
The
man
*NL*
who
had
sprawled
upon
the
ground
started
up
and
said
,
``
Gosh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
turned
quick
eyes
upon
the
field
.
He
discerned
forms
begin
to
*NL*
swell
in
masses
out
of
a
distant
wood
.
He
again
saw
the
tilted
flag
*NL*
speeding
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shells
,
which
had
ceased
to
trouble
the
regiment
for
a
time
,
came
*NL*
swirling
again
,
and
exploded
in
the
grass
or
among
the
leaves
of
the
*NL*
trees
.
They
looked
to
be
strange
war
flowers
bursting
into
fierce
*NL*
bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
groaned
.
The
luster
faded
from
their
eyes
.
Their
smudged
*NL*
countenances
now
expressed
a
profound
dejection
.
They
moved
their
*NL*
stiffened
bodies
slowly
,
and
watched
in
sullen
mood
the
frantic
*NL*
approach
of
the
enemy
.
The
slaves
toiling
in
the
temple
of
this
god
*NL*
began
to
feel
rebellion
at
his
harsh
tasks
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
fretted
and
complained
each
to
each
.
``
Oh
,
say
,
this
is
too
much
of
*NL*
a
good
thing
!
Why
ca
n't
somebody
send
us
supports
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ai
n't
never
goin
'
to
stand
this
second
banging
.
I
did
n't
come
here
*NL*
to
fight
the
hull
damn
'
rebel
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
who
raised
a
doleful
cry
.
``
I
wish
Bill
Smithers
had
trod
*NL*
on
my
hand
,
insteader
me
treddin
'
on
his
`
n.
''
The
sore
joints
of
the
*NL*
regiment
creaked
as
it
painfully
floundered
into
position
to
repulse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
stared
.
Surely
,
he
thought
,
this
impossible
thing
was
not
*NL*
about
to
happen
.
He
waited
as
if
he
expected
the
enemy
to
suddenly
*NL*
stop
,
apologize
,
and
retire
bowing
.
It
was
all
a
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
firing
began
somewhere
on
the
regimental
line
and
ripped
along
*NL*
in
both
directions
.
The
level
sheets
of
flame
developed
great
clouds
of
*NL*
smoke
that
tumbled
and
tossed
in
the
mild
wind
near
the
ground
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
then
rolled
through
the
ranks
as
through
a
gate
.
The
*NL*
clouds
were
tinged
an
earthlike
yellow
in
the
sunrays
and
in
the
shadow
*NL*
were
a
sorry
blue
.
The
flag
was
sometimes
eaten
and
lost
in
this
mass
*NL*
of
vapor
,
but
more
often
it
projected
,
sun-touched
,
resplendent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
the
youth
's
eyes
there
came
a
look
that
one
can
see
in
the
orbs
of
*NL*
a
jaded
horse
.
His
neck
was
quivering
with
nervous
weakness
and
the
*NL*
muscles
of
his
arms
felt
numb
and
bloodless
.
His
hands
,
too
,
seemed
*NL*
large
and
awkward
as
if
he
was
wearing
invisible
mittens
.
And
there
*NL*
was
a
great
uncertainty
about
his
knee
joints
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
that
comrades
had
uttered
previous
to
the
firing
began
to
*NL*
recur
to
him
.
``
Oh
,
say
,
this
is
too
much
of
a
good
thing
!
What
do
*NL*
they
take
us
for
--
why
do
n't
they
send
supports
?
I
did
n't
come
here
to
*NL*
fight
the
hull
damned
rebel
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
exaggerate
the
endurance
,
the
skill
,
and
the
valor
of
those
*NL*
who
were
coming
.
Himself
reeling
from
exhaustion
,
he
was
astonished
*NL*
beyond
measure
at
such
persistency
.
They
must
be
machines
of
steel
.
It
*NL*
was
very
gloomy
struggling
against
such
affairs
,
wound
up
perhaps
to
*NL*
fight
until
sundown
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
slowly
lifted
his
rifle
and
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
thickspread
*NL*
field
he
blazed
at
a
cantering
cluster
.
He
stopped
then
and
began
to
*NL*
peer
as
best
he
could
through
the
smoke
.
He
caught
changing
views
of
*NL*
the
ground
covered
with
men
who
were
all
running
like
pursued
imps
,
and
*NL*
yelling
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
youth
it
was
an
onslaught
of
redoubtable
dragons
.
He
became
*NL*
like
the
man
who
lost
his
legs
at
the
approach
of
the
red
and
green
*NL*
monster
.
He
waited
in
a
sort
of
a
horrified
,
listening
attitude
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
shut
his
eyes
and
wait
to
be
gobbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
near
him
who
up
to
this
time
had
been
working
feverishly
at
his
*NL*
rifle
suddenly
stopped
and
ran
with
howls
.
A
lad
whose
face
had
borne
*NL*
an
expression
of
exalted
courage
,
the
majesty
of
he
who
dares
give
his
*NL*
life
,
was
,
at
an
instant
,
smitten
abject
.
He
blanched
like
one
who
has
*NL*
come
to
the
edge
of
a
cliff
at
midnight
and
is
suddenly
made
aware
.
*NL*
There
was
a
revelation
.
He
,
too
,
threw
down
his
gun
and
fled
.
There
*NL*
was
no
shame
in
his
face
.
He
ran
like
a
rabbit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Others
began
to
scamper
away
through
the
smoke
.
The
youth
turned
his
*NL*
head
,
shaken
from
his
trance
by
this
movement
as
if
the
regiment
was
*NL*
leaving
him
behind
.
He
saw
the
few
fleeting
forms
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
yelled
then
with
fright
and
swung
about
.
For
a
moment
,
in
the
great
*NL*
clamor
,
he
was
like
a
proverbial
chicken
.
He
lost
the
direction
of
*NL*
safety
.
Destruction
threatened
him
from
all
points
.
*NL*
*NL*
Directly
he
began
to
speed
toward
the
rear
in
great
leaps
.
His
rifle
*NL*
and
cap
were
gone
.
His
unbuttoned
coat
bulged
in
the
wind
.
The
flap
*NL*
of
his
cartridge
box
bobbed
wildly
,
and
his
canteen
,
by
its
slender
*NL*
cord
,
swung
out
behind
.
On
his
face
was
all
the
horror
of
those
things
*NL*
which
he
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
sprang
forward
bawling
.
The
youth
saw
his
features
*NL*
wrathfully
red
,
and
saw
him
make
a
dab
with
his
sword
.
His
one
thought
*NL*
of
the
incident
was
that
the
lieutenant
was
a
peculiar
creature
to
feel
*NL*
interested
in
such
matters
upon
this
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
like
a
blind
man
.
Two
or
three
times
he
fell
down
.
Once
he
*NL*
knocked
his
shoulder
so
heavily
against
a
tree
that
he
went
headlong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
he
had
turned
his
back
upon
the
fight
his
fears
had
been
*NL*
wondrously
magnified
.
Death
about
to
thrust
him
between
the
shoulder
*NL*
blades
was
far
more
dreadful
than
death
about
to
smite
him
between
the
*NL*
eyes
.
When
he
thought
of
it
later
,
he
conceived
the
impression
that
it
*NL*
is
better
to
view
the
appalling
than
to
be
merely
within
hearing
.
The
*NL*
noises
of
the
battle
were
like
stones
;
he
believed
himself
liable
to
be
*NL*
crushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
ran
he
mingled
with
others
.
He
dimly
saw
men
on
his
right
and
on
*NL*
his
left
,
and
he
heard
footsteps
behind
him
.
He
thought
that
all
the
*NL*
regiment
was
fleeing
,
pursued
by
these
ominous
crashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
flight
the
sound
of
these
following
footsteps
gave
him
his
one
*NL*
meager
relief
.
He
felt
vaguely
that
death
must
make
a
first
choice
of
*NL*
the
men
who
were
nearest
;
the
initial
morsels
for
the
dragons
would
be
*NL*
then
those
who
were
following
him
.
So
he
displayed
the
zeal
of
an
*NL*
insane
sprinter
in
his
purpose
to
keep
them
in
the
rear
.
There
was
a
*NL*
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
,
leading
,
went
across
a
little
field
,
he
found
himself
in
a
*NL*
region
of
shells
.
They
hurtled
over
his
head
with
long
wild
screams
.
*NL*
As
he
listened
he
imagined
them
to
have
rows
of
cruel
teeth
that
*NL*
grinned
at
him
.
Once
one
lit
before
him
and
the
livid
lightning
of
the
*NL*
explosion
effectually
barred
the
way
in
his
chosen
direction
.
He
*NL*
groveled
on
the
ground
and
then
springing
up
went
careering
off
through
*NL*
some
bushes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
experienced
a
thrill
of
amazement
when
he
came
within
view
of
a
*NL*
battery
in
action
.
The
men
there
seemed
to
be
in
conventional
moods
,
*NL*
altogether
unaware
of
the
impending
annihilation
.
The
battery
was
*NL*
disputing
with
a
distant
antagonist
and
the
gunners
were
wrapped
in
*NL*
admiration
of
their
shooting
.
They
were
continually
bending
in
coaxing
*NL*
postures
over
the
guns
.
They
seemed
to
be
patting
them
on
the
back
and
*NL*
encouraging
them
with
words
.
The
guns
,
stolid
and
undaunted
,
spoke
*NL*
with
dogged
valor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
precise
gunners
were
coolly
enthusiastic
.
They
lifted
their
eyes
*NL*
every
chance
to
the
smoke-wreathed
hillock
from
whence
the
hostile
*NL*
battery
addressed
them
.
The
youth
pitied
them
as
he
ran
.
Methodical
*NL*
idiots
!
Machine-like
fools
!
The
refined
joy
of
planting
shells
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
other
battery
's
formation
would
appear
a
little
thing
when
*NL*
the
infantry
came
swooping
out
of
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
of
a
youthful
rider
,
who
was
jerking
his
frantic
horse
with
an
*NL*
abandon
of
temper
he
might
display
in
a
placid
barnyard
,
was
impressed
*NL*
deeply
upon
his
mind
.
He
knew
that
he
looked
upon
a
man
who
would
*NL*
presently
be
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Too
,
he
felt
a
pity
for
the
guns
,
standing
,
six
good
comrades
,
in
a
*NL*
bold
row
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
a
brigade
going
to
the
relief
of
its
pestered
fellows
.
He
*NL*
scrambled
upon
a
wee
hill
and
watched
it
sweeping
finely
,
keeping
*NL*
formation
in
difficult
places
.
The
blue
of
the
line
was
crusted
with
*NL*
steel
color
,
and
the
brilliant
flags
projected
.
Officers
were
shouting
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sight
also
filled
him
with
wonder
.
The
brigade
was
hurrying
*NL*
briskly
to
be
gulped
into
the
infernal
mouths
of
the
war
god
.
What
*NL*
manner
of
men
were
they
,
anyhow
?
Ah
,
it
was
some
wondrous
breed
!
Or
*NL*
else
they
did
n't
comprehend
--
the
fools
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
furious
order
caused
commotion
in
the
artillery
.
An
officer
on
a
*NL*
bounding
horse
made
maniacal
motions
with
his
arms
.
The
teams
went
*NL*
swinging
up
from
the
rear
,
the
guns
were
whirled
about
,
and
the
battery
*NL*
scampered
away
.
The
cannon
with
their
noses
poked
slantingly
at
the
*NL*
ground
grunted
and
grumbled
like
stout
men
,
brave
but
with
objections
*NL*
to
hurry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
went
on
,
moderating
his
pace
since
he
had
left
the
place
of
*NL*
noises
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
he
came
upon
a
general
of
division
seated
upon
a
horse
that
*NL*
pricked
its
ears
in
an
interested
way
at
the
battle
.
There
was
a
great
*NL*
gleaming
of
yellow
and
patent
leather
about
the
saddle
and
bridle
.
The
*NL*
quiet
man
astride
looked
mouse-colored
upon
such
a
splendid
charger
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
jingling
staff
was
galloping
hither
and
thither
.
Sometimes
the
*NL*
general
was
surrounded
by
horsemen
and
at
other
times
he
was
quite
*NL*
alone
.
He
looked
to
be
much
harassed
.
He
had
the
appearance
of
a
*NL*
business
man
whose
market
is
swinging
up
and
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
went
slinking
around
this
spot
.
He
went
as
near
as
he
dared
*NL*
trying
to
overhear
words
.
Perhaps
the
general
,
unable
to
comprehend
*NL*
chaos
,
might
call
upon
him
for
information
.
And
he
could
tell
him
.
He
*NL*
knew
all
concerning
it
.
Of
a
surety
the
force
was
in
a
fix
,
and
any
*NL*
fool
could
see
that
if
they
did
not
retreat
while
they
had
*NL*
opportunity
--
why
--
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
he
would
like
to
thrash
the
general
,
or
at
least
approach
*NL*
and
tell
him
in
plain
words
exactly
what
he
thought
him
to
be
.
It
was
*NL*
criminal
to
stay
calmly
in
one
spot
and
make
no
effort
to
stay
*NL*
destruction
.
He
loitered
in
a
fever
of
eagerness
for
the
division
*NL*
commander
to
apply
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
warily
moved
about
,
he
heard
the
general
call
out
irritably
:
*NL*
``
Tompkins
,
go
over
an
'
see
Taylor
,
an
'
tell
him
not
t
'
be
in
such
an
*NL*
all-fired
hurry
;
tell
him
t
'
halt
his
brigade
in
th
'
edge
of
th
'
woods
;
*NL*
tell
him
t
'
detach
a
reg
`
ment
--
say
I
think
th
'
center
'll
break
if
we
*NL*
do
n't
help
it
out
some
;
tell
him
t
'
hurry
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
slim
youth
on
a
fine
chestnut
horse
caught
these
swift
words
from
the
*NL*
mouth
of
his
superior
.
He
made
his
horse
bound
into
a
gallop
almost
*NL*
from
a
walk
in
his
haste
to
go
upon
his
mission
.
There
was
a
cloud
of
*NL*
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
the
youth
saw
the
general
bounce
excitedly
in
his
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
by
heavens
,
they
have
!
''
The
officer
leaned
forward
.
His
face
*NL*
was
aflame
with
excitement
.
``
Yes
,
by
heavens
,
they
've
held
`
im
!
They
*NL*
've
held
`
im
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
blithely
roar
at
his
staff
:
``
We
'll
wallop
`
im
now
.
We
'll
*NL*
wallop
`
im
now
.
We
've
got
'em
sure
.
''
He
turned
suddenly
upon
an
aid
:
*NL*
``
Here
--
you
--
Jones
--
quick
--
ride
after
Tompkins
--
see
Taylor
--
tell
him
t
'
*NL*
go
in
--
everlastingly
--
like
blazes
--
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
another
officer
sped
his
horse
after
the
first
messenger
,
the
*NL*
general
beamed
upon
the
earth
like
a
sun
.
In
his
eyes
was
a
desire
to
*NL*
chant
a
paean
.
He
kept
repeating
,
``
They
've
held
'em
,
by
heavens
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
excitement
made
his
horse
plunge
,
and
he
merrily
kicked
and
swore
*NL*
at
it
.
He
held
a
little
carnival
of
joy
on
horseback
.

CHAPTER
VII
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
cringed
as
if
discovered
in
a
crime
.
By
heavens
,
they
had
won
*NL*
after
all
!
The
imbecile
line
had
remained
and
become
victors
.
He
could
*NL*
hear
cheering
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
himself
upon
his
toes
and
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
*NL*
fight
.
A
yellow
fog
lay
wallowing
on
the
treetops
.
From
beneath
it
*NL*
came
the
clatter
of
musketry
.
Hoarse
cries
told
of
an
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
amazed
and
angry
.
He
felt
that
he
had
been
wronged
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
fled
,
he
told
himself
,
because
annihilation
approached
.
He
had
*NL*
done
a
good
part
in
saving
himself
,
who
was
a
little
piece
of
the
army
.
*NL*
He
had
considered
the
time
,
he
said
,
to
be
one
in
which
it
was
the
duty
*NL*
of
every
little
piece
to
rescue
itself
if
possible
.
Later
the
officers
*NL*
could
fit
the
little
pieces
together
again
,
and
make
a
battle
front
.
If
*NL*
none
of
the
little
pieces
were
wise
enough
to
save
themselves
from
the
*NL*
flurry
of
death
at
such
a
time
,
why
,
then
,
where
would
be
the
army
?
It
*NL*
was
all
plain
that
he
had
proceeded
according
to
very
correct
and
*NL*
commendable
rules
.
His
actions
had
been
sagacious
things
.
They
had
*NL*
been
full
of
strategy
.
They
were
the
work
of
a
master
's
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thoughts
of
his
comrades
came
to
him
.
The
brittle
blue
line
had
*NL*
withstood
the
blows
and
won
.
He
grew
bitter
over
it
.
It
seemed
that
*NL*
the
blind
ignorance
and
stupidity
of
those
little
pieces
had
betrayed
*NL*
him
.
He
had
been
overturned
and
crushed
by
their
lack
of
sense
in
*NL*
holding
the
position
,
when
intelligent
deliberation
would
have
*NL*
convinced
them
that
it
was
impossible
.
He
,
the
enlightened
man
who
*NL*
looks
afar
in
the
dark
,
had
fled
because
of
his
superior
perceptions
*NL*
and
knowledge
.
He
felt
a
great
anger
against
his
comrades
.
He
knew
it
*NL*
could
be
proved
that
they
had
been
fools
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
what
they
would
remark
when
later
he
appeared
in
camp
.
His
*NL*
mind
heard
howls
of
derision
.
Their
density
would
not
enable
them
to
*NL*
understand
his
sharper
point
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
pity
himself
acutely
.
He
was
ill
used
.
He
was
trodden
*NL*
beneath
the
feet
of
an
iron
injustice
.
He
had
proceeded
with
wisdom
*NL*
and
from
the
most
righteous
motives
under
heaven
's
blue
only
to
be
*NL*
frustrated
by
hateful
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dull
,
animal-like
rebellion
against
his
fellows
,
war
in
the
abstract
,
*NL*
and
fate
grew
within
him
.
He
shambled
along
with
bowed
head
,
his
brain
*NL*
in
a
tumult
of
agony
and
despair
.
When
he
looked
loweringly
up
,
*NL*
quivering
at
each
sound
,
his
eyes
had
the
expression
of
those
of
a
*NL*
criminal
who
thinks
his
guilt
and
his
punishment
great
,
and
knows
that
*NL*
he
can
find
no
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
from
the
fields
into
a
thick
woods
,
as
if
resolved
to
bury
*NL*
himself
.
He
wished
to
get
out
of
hearing
of
the
crackling
shots
which
*NL*
were
to
him
like
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ground
was
cluttered
with
vines
and
bushes
,
and
the
trees
grew
*NL*
close
and
spread
out
like
bouquets
.
He
was
obliged
to
force
his
way
*NL*
with
much
noise
.
The
creepers
,
catching
against
his
legs
,
cried
out
*NL*
harshly
as
their
sprays
were
torn
from
the
barks
of
trees
.
The
*NL*
swishing
saplings
tried
to
make
known
his
presence
to
the
world
.
He
*NL*
could
not
conciliate
the
forest
.
As
he
made
his
way
,
it
was
always
*NL*
calling
out
protestations
.
When
he
separated
embraces
of
trees
and
*NL*
vines
the
disturbed
foliages
waved
their
arms
and
turned
their
face
*NL*
leaves
toward
him
.
He
dreaded
lest
these
noisy
motions
and
cries
*NL*
should
bring
men
to
look
at
him
.
So
he
went
far
,
seeking
dark
and
*NL*
intricate
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
the
sound
of
musketry
grew
faint
and
the
cannon
boomed
in
*NL*
the
distance
.
The
sun
,
suddenly
apparent
,
blazed
among
the
trees
.
The
*NL*
insects
were
making
rhythmical
noises
.
They
seemed
to
be
grinding
*NL*
their
teeth
in
unison
.
A
woodpecker
stuck
his
impudent
head
around
the
*NL*
side
of
a
tree
.
A
bird
flew
on
lighthearted
wing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Off
was
the
rumble
of
death
.
It
seemed
now
that
Nature
had
no
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
landscape
gave
him
assurance
.
A
fair
field
holding
life
.
It
was
*NL*
the
religion
of
peace
.
It
would
die
if
its
timid
eyes
were
compelled
to
*NL*
see
blood
.
He
conceived
Nature
to
be
a
woman
with
a
deep
aversion
to
*NL*
tragedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
a
pine
cone
at
a
jovial
squirrel
,
and
he
ran
with
chattering
*NL*
fear
.
High
in
a
treetop
he
stopped
,
and
,
poking
his
head
cautiously
*NL*
from
behind
a
branch
,
looked
down
with
an
air
of
trepidation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
felt
triumphant
at
this
exhibition
.
There
was
the
law
,
he
*NL*
said
.
Nature
had
given
him
a
sign
.
The
squirrel
,
immediately
upon
*NL*
recognizing
danger
,
had
taken
to
his
legs
without
ado
.
He
did
not
*NL*
stand
stolidly
baring
his
furry
belly
to
the
missile
,
and
die
with
an
*NL*
upward
glance
at
the
sympathetic
heavens
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
had
fled
*NL*
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
;
and
he
was
but
an
ordinary
*NL*
squirrel
,
too
--
doubtless
no
philosopher
of
his
race
.
The
youth
wended
,
*NL*
feeling
that
Nature
was
of
his
mind
.
She
re-enforced
his
argument
with
*NL*
proofs
that
lived
where
the
sun
shone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
found
himself
almost
into
a
swamp
.
He
was
obliged
to
walk
upon
*NL*
bog
tufts
and
watch
his
feet
to
keep
from
the
oily
mire
.
Pausing
at
*NL*
one
time
to
look
about
him
he
saw
,
out
at
some
black
water
,
a
small
*NL*
animal
pounce
in
and
emerge
directly
with
a
gleaming
fish
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
went
again
into
the
deep
thickets
.
The
brushed
branches
made
*NL*
a
noise
that
drowned
the
sounds
of
cannon
.
He
walked
on
,
going
from
*NL*
obscurity
into
promises
of
a
greater
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
reached
a
place
where
the
high
,
arching
boughs
made
a
*NL*
chapel
.
He
softly
pushed
the
green
doors
aside
and
entered
.
Pine
*NL*
needles
were
a
gentle
brown
carpet
.
There
was
a
religious
half
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
threshold
he
stopped
,
horror-stricken
at
the
sight
of
a
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
being
looked
at
by
a
dead
man
who
was
seated
with
his
back
*NL*
against
a
columnlike
tree
.
The
corpse
was
dressed
in
a
uniform
that
*NL*
once
had
been
blue
,
but
was
now
faded
to
a
melancholy
shade
of
green
.
*NL*
The
eyes
,
staring
at
the
youth
,
had
changed
to
the
dull
hue
to
be
seen
*NL*
on
the
side
of
a
dead
fish
.
The
mouth
was
open
.
Its
red
had
changed
to
*NL*
an
appalling
yellow
.
Over
the
gray
skin
of
the
face
ran
little
ants
.
*NL*
One
was
trundling
some
sort
of
a
bundle
along
the
upper
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
gave
a
shriek
as
he
confronted
the
thing
.
He
was
for
moments
*NL*
turned
to
stone
before
it
.
He
remained
staring
into
the
liquid-looking
*NL*
eyes
.
The
dead
man
and
the
living
man
exchanged
a
long
look
.
Then
the
*NL*
youth
cautiously
put
one
hand
behind
him
and
brought
it
against
a
tree
.
*NL*
Leaning
upon
this
he
retreated
,
step
by
step
,
with
his
face
still
*NL*
toward
the
thing
.
He
feared
that
if
he
turned
his
back
the
body
might
*NL*
spring
up
and
stealthily
pursue
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
branches
,
pushing
against
him
,
threatened
to
throw
him
over
upon
*NL*
it
.
His
unguided
feet
,
too
,
caught
aggravatingly
in
brambles
;
and
with
*NL*
it
all
he
received
a
subtle
suggestion
to
touch
the
corpse
.
As
he
*NL*
thought
of
his
hand
upon
it
he
shuddered
profoundly
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
burst
the
bonds
which
had
fastened
him
to
the
spot
and
fled
,
*NL*
unheeding
the
underbrush
.
He
was
pursued
by
a
sight
of
the
black
ants
*NL*
swarming
greedily
upon
the
gray
face
and
venturing
horribly
near
to
the
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
he
paused
,
and
,
breathless
and
panting
,
listened
.
He
*NL*
imagined
some
strange
voice
would
come
from
the
dead
throat
and
squawk
*NL*
after
him
in
horrible
menaces
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trees
about
the
portal
of
the
chapel
moved
soughingly
in
a
soft
*NL*
wind
.
A
sad
silence
was
upon
the
little
guarding
edifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trees
began
softly
to
sing
a
hymn
of
twilight
.
The
sun
sank
until
*NL*
slanted
bronze
rays
struck
the
forest
.
There
was
a
lull
in
the
noises
*NL*
of
insects
as
if
they
had
bowed
their
beaks
and
were
making
a
*NL*
devotional
pause
.
There
was
silence
save
for
the
chanted
chorus
of
the
*NL*
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
upon
this
stillness
,
there
suddenly
broke
a
tremendous
clangor
of
*NL*
sounds
.
A
crimson
roar
came
from
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
stopped
.
He
was
transfixed
by
this
terrific
medley
of
all
*NL*
noises
.
It
was
as
if
worlds
were
being
rended
.
There
was
the
ripping
*NL*
sound
of
musketry
and
the
breaking
crash
of
the
artillery
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
flew
in
all
directions
.
He
conceived
the
two
armies
to
be
at
*NL*
each
other
panther
fashion
.
He
listened
for
a
time
.
Then
he
began
to
*NL*
run
in
the
direction
of
the
battle
.
He
saw
that
it
was
an
ironical
*NL*
thing
for
him
to
be
running
thus
toward
that
which
he
had
been
at
such
*NL*
pains
to
avoid
.
But
he
said
,
in
substance
,
to
himself
that
if
the
*NL*
earth
and
the
moon
were
about
to
clash
,
many
persons
would
doubtless
*NL*
plan
to
get
upon
the
roofs
to
witness
the
collision
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
ran
,
he
became
aware
that
the
forest
had
stopped
its
music
,
as
if
*NL*
at
last
becoming
capable
of
hearing
the
foreign
sounds
.
The
trees
*NL*
hushed
and
stood
motionless
.
Everything
seemed
to
be
listening
to
the
*NL*
crackle
and
clatter
and
earshaking
thunder
.
The
chorus
pealed
over
the
*NL*
still
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
suddenly
occurred
to
the
youth
that
the
fight
in
which
he
had
been
*NL*
was
,
after
all
,
but
perfunctory
popping
.
In
the
hearing
of
this
*NL*
present
din
he
was
doubtful
if
he
had
seen
real
battle
scenes
.
This
*NL*
uproar
explained
a
celestial
battle
;
it
was
tumbling
hordes
a-struggle
*NL*
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reflecting
,
he
saw
a
sort
of
a
humor
in
the
point
of
view
of
himself
*NL*
and
his
fellows
during
the
late
encounter
.
They
had
taken
themselves
*NL*
and
the
enemy
very
seriously
and
had
imagined
that
they
were
deciding
*NL*
the
war
.
Individuals
must
have
supposed
that
they
were
cutting
the
*NL*
letters
of
their
names
deep
into
everlasting
tablets
of
brass
,
or
*NL*
enshrining
their
reputations
forever
in
the
hearts
of
their
countrymen
,
*NL*
while
,
as
to
fact
,
the
affair
would
appear
in
printed
reports
under
a
*NL*
meek
and
immaterial
title
.
But
he
saw
that
it
was
good
,
else
,
he
said
,
*NL*
in
battle
every
one
would
surely
run
save
forlorn
hopes
and
their
ilk
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
rapidly
on
.
He
wished
to
come
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
that
*NL*
he
might
peer
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
hastened
,
there
passed
through
his
mind
pictures
of
stupendous
*NL*
conflicts
.
His
accumulated
thought
upon
such
subjects
was
used
to
form
*NL*
scenes
.
The
noise
was
as
the
voice
of
an
eloquent
being
,
describing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
the
brambles
formed
chains
and
tried
to
hold
him
back
.
Trees
,
*NL*
confronting
him
,
stretched
out
their
arms
and
forbade
him
to
pass
.
*NL*
After
its
previous
hostility
this
new
resistance
of
the
forest
filled
*NL*
him
with
a
fine
bitterness
.
It
seemed
that
Nature
could
not
be
quite
*NL*
ready
to
kill
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
obstinately
took
roundabout
ways
,
and
presently
he
was
where
he
*NL*
could
see
long
gray
walls
of
vapor
where
lay
battle
lines
.
The
voices
*NL*
of
cannon
shook
him
.
The
musketry
sounded
in
long
irregular
surges
*NL*
that
played
havoc
with
his
ears
.
He
stood
regardant
for
a
moment
.
His
*NL*
eyes
had
an
awestruck
expression
.
He
gawked
in
the
direction
of
the
*NL*
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
he
proceeded
again
on
his
forward
way
.
The
battle
was
like
*NL*
the
grinding
of
an
immense
and
terrible
machine
to
him
.
Its
*NL*
complexities
and
powers
,
its
grim
processes
,
fascinated
him
.
He
must
*NL*
go
close
and
see
it
produce
corpses
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
to
a
fence
and
clambered
over
it
.
On
the
far
side
,
the
ground
*NL*
was
littered
with
clothes
and
guns
.
A
newspaper
,
folded
up
,
lay
in
the
*NL*
dirt
.
A
dead
soldier
was
stretched
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
arm
.
*NL*
Farther
off
there
was
a
group
of
four
or
five
corpses
keeping
mournful
*NL*
company
.
A
hot
sun
had
blazed
upon
the
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
place
the
youth
felt
that
he
was
an
invader
.
This
forgotten
*NL*
part
of
the
battle
ground
was
owned
by
the
dead
men
,
and
he
hurried
,
in
*NL*
the
vague
apprehension
that
one
of
the
swollen
forms
would
rise
and
*NL*
tell
him
to
begone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
finally
to
a
road
from
which
he
could
see
in
the
distance
dark
*NL*
and
agitated
bodies
of
troops
,
smoke-fringed
.
In
the
lane
was
a
*NL*
blood-stained
crowd
streaming
to
the
rear
.
The
wounded
men
were
*NL*
cursing
,
groaning
,
and
wailing
.
In
the
air
,
always
,
was
a
mighty
swell
*NL*
of
sound
that
it
seemed
could
sway
the
earth
.
With
the
courageous
words
*NL*
of
the
artillery
and
the
spiteful
sentences
of
the
musketry
mingled
red
*NL*
cheers
.
And
from
this
region
of
noises
came
the
steady
current
of
the
*NL*
maimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
wounded
men
had
a
shoeful
of
blood
.
He
hopped
like
a
*NL*
schoolboy
in
a
game
.
He
was
laughing
hysterically
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
was
swearing
that
he
had
been
shot
in
the
arm
through
the
*NL*
commanding
general
's
mismanagement
of
the
army
.
One
was
marching
with
*NL*
an
air
imitative
of
some
sublime
drum
major
.
Upon
his
features
was
an
*NL*
unholy
mixture
of
merriment
and
agony
.
As
he
marched
he
sang
a
bit
of
*NL*
doggerel
in
a
high
and
quavering
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sing
a
song
'
a
vic
`
try
,
*NL*
A
pocketful
'
a
bullets
,
*NL*
Five
an
'
twenty
dead
men
*NL*
Baked
in
a
--
pie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Parts
of
the
procession
limped
and
staggered
to
this
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
had
the
gray
seal
of
death
already
upon
his
face
.
His
lips
*NL*
were
curled
in
hard
lines
and
his
teeth
were
clinched
.
His
hands
were
*NL*
bloody
from
where
he
had
pressed
them
upon
his
wound
.
He
seemed
to
be
*NL*
awaiting
the
moment
when
he
should
pitch
headlong
.
He
stalked
like
the
*NL*
specter
of
a
soldier
,
his
eyes
burning
with
the
power
of
a
stare
into
*NL*
the
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
who
proceeded
sullenly
,
full
of
anger
at
their
wounds
,
*NL*
and
ready
to
turn
upon
anything
as
an
obscure
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
officer
was
carried
along
by
two
privates
.
He
was
peevish
.
``
Do
n't
*NL*
joggle
so
,
Johnson
,
yeh
fool
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Think
m
'
leg
is
made
of
*NL*
iron
?
If
yeh
ca
n't
carry
me
decent
,
put
me
down
an
'
let
some
one
else
*NL*
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bellowed
at
the
tottering
crowd
who
blocked
the
quick
march
of
his
*NL*
bearers
.
``
Say
,
make
way
there
,
ca
n't
yeh
?
Make
way
,
dickens
take
it
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sulkily
parted
and
went
to
the
roadsides
.
As
he
was
carried
past
*NL*
they
made
pert
remarks
to
him
.
When
he
raged
in
reply
and
threatened
*NL*
them
,
they
told
him
to
be
damned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shoulder
of
one
of
the
tramping
bearers
knocked
heavily
against
the
*NL*
spectral
soldier
who
was
staring
into
the
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
joined
this
crowd
and
marched
along
with
it
.
The
torn
bodies
*NL*
expressed
the
awful
machinery
in
which
the
men
had
been
entangled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Orderlies
and
couriers
occasionally
broke
through
the
throng
in
the
*NL*
roadway
,
scattering
wounded
men
right
and
left
,
galloping
on
followed
*NL*
by
howls
.
The
melancholy
march
was
continually
disturbed
by
the
*NL*
messengers
,
and
sometimes
by
bustling
batteries
that
came
swinging
and
*NL*
thumping
down
upon
them
,
the
officers
shouting
orders
to
clear
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
tattered
man
,
fouled
with
dust
,
blood
and
powder
stain
from
*NL*
hair
to
shoes
,
who
trudged
quietly
at
the
youth
's
side
.
He
was
*NL*
listening
with
eagerness
and
much
humility
to
the
lurid
descriptions
of
*NL*
a
bearded
sergeant
.
His
lean
features
wore
an
expression
of
awe
and
*NL*
admiration
.
He
was
like
a
listener
in
a
country
store
to
wondrous
*NL*
tales
told
among
the
sugar
barrels
.
He
eyed
the
story-teller
with
*NL*
unspeakable
wonder
.
His
mouth
was
agape
in
yokel
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
,
taking
note
of
this
,
gave
pause
to
his
elaborate
history
*NL*
while
he
administered
a
sardonic
comment
.
``
Be
keerful
,
honey
,
you
'll
*NL*
be
a-ketchin
'
flies
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tattered
man
shrank
back
abashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
he
began
to
sidle
near
to
the
youth
,
and
in
a
different
*NL*
way
try
to
make
him
a
friend
.
His
voice
was
gentle
as
a
girl
's
voice
*NL*
and
his
eyes
were
pleading
.
The
youth
saw
with
surprise
that
the
*NL*
soldier
had
two
wounds
,
one
in
the
head
,
bound
with
a
blood-soaked
rag
,
*NL*
and
the
other
in
the
arm
,
making
that
member
dangle
like
a
broken
bough
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
they
had
walked
together
for
some
time
the
tattered
man
mustered
*NL*
sufficient
courage
to
speak
.
``
Was
pretty
good
fight
,
wa
'n'
t
it
?
''
he
*NL*
timidly
said
.
The
youth
,
deep
in
thought
,
glanced
up
at
the
bloody
and
*NL*
grim
figure
with
its
lamblike
eyes
.
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
pretty
good
fight
,
wa
'n'
t
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
youth
shortly
.
He
quickened
his
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
other
hobbled
industriously
after
him
.
There
was
an
air
of
*NL*
apology
in
his
manner
,
but
he
evidently
thought
that
he
needed
only
to
*NL*
talk
for
a
time
,
and
the
youth
would
perceive
that
he
was
a
good
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
pretty
good
fight
,
wa
'n'
t
it
?
''
he
began
in
a
small
voice
,
and
then
*NL*
he
achieved
the
fortitude
to
continue
.
``
Dern
me
if
I
ever
see
fellers
*NL*

so
.
Laws

how
they
did

this

they
showed

No

!
They

fighters
,

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
breathed
a
deep
breath
of
humble
admiration
.
He
had
looked
at
the
*NL*
youth
for
encouragement
several
times
.
He
received
none
,
but
gradually
*NL*
he
seemed
to
get
absorbed
in
his
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
His
homely
face
was
suffused
with
a
light
of
love
for
the
army
which
*NL*
was
to
him
all
things
beautiful
and
powerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
he
turned
to
the
youth
.
``
Where
yeh
hit
,
ol'
boy
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
in
a
brotherly
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
felt
instant
panic
at
this
question
,
although
at
first
its
*NL*
full
import
was
not
borne
in
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
yeh
hit

''
repeated
the
tattered
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

''
began
the
youth
,
``
I
--
I
--
that
is
--
why

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
suddenly
and
slid
through
the
crowd
.
His
brow
was
*NL*
heavily
flushed
,
and
his
fingers
were
picking
nervously
at
one
of
his
*NL*
buttons
.
He
bent
his
head
and
fastened
his
eyes
studiously
upon
the
*NL*
button
as
if
it
were
a
little
problem
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tattered
man
looked
after
him
in
astonishment

CHAPTER
IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
fell
back
in
the
procession
until
the
tattered
soldier
was
*NL*
not
in
sight
.
Then
he
started
to
walk
on
with
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
amid
wounds
.
The
mob
of
men
was
bleeding
.
Because
of
the
*NL*
tattered
soldier
's
question
he
now
felt
that
his
shame
could
be
viewed
.
*NL*
He
was
continually
casting
sidelong
glances
to
see
if
the
men
were
*NL*
contemplating
the
letters
of
guilt
he
felt
burned
into
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
times
he
regarded
the
wounded
soldiers
in
an
envious
way
.
He
*NL*
conceived
persons
with
torn
bodies
to
be
peculiarly
happy
.
He
wished
*NL*
that
he
,
too
,
had
a
wound
,
a
red
badge
of
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spectral
soldier
was
at
his
side
like
a
stalking
reproach
.
The
*NL*
man
's
eyes
were
still
fixed
in
a
stare
into
the
unknown
.
His
gray
,
*NL*
appalling
face
had
attracted
attention
in
the
crowd
,
and
men
,
slowing
*NL*
to
his
dreary
pace
,
were
walking
with
him
.
They
were
discussing
his
*NL*
plight
,
questioning
him
and
giving
him
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
dogged
way
he
repelled
them
,
signing
to
them
to
go
on
and
leave
*NL*
him
alone
.
The
shadows
of
his
face
were
deepening
and
his
tight
lips
*NL*
seemed
holding
in
check
the
moan
of
great
despair
.
There
could
be
seen
*NL*
a
certain
stiffness
in
the
movements
of
his
body
,
as
if
he
were
taking
*NL*
infinite
care
not
to
arouse
the
passion
of
his
wounds
.
As
he
went
on
,
*NL*
he
seemed
always
looking
for
a
place
,
like
one
who
goes
to
choose
a
*NL*
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
the
gesture
of
the
man
as
he
waved
the
bloody
and
pitying
*NL*
soldiers
away
made
the
youth
start
as
if
bitten
.
He
yelled
in
horror
.
*NL*
Tottering
forward
he
laid
a
quivering
hand
upon
the
man
's
arm
.
As
the
*NL*
latter
slowly
turned
his
waxlike
features
toward
him
,
the
youth
*NL*
screamed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gawd
!
Jim
Conklin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
soldier
made
a
little
commonplace
smile
.
``
Hello
,
Henry
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
swayed
on
his
legs
and
glared
strangely
.
He
stuttered
and
*NL*
stammered
.
``
Oh
,
Jim
--
oh
,
Jim
--
oh
,
Jim
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
soldier
held
out
his
gory
hand
.
There
was
a
curious
red
and
*NL*
black
combination
of
new
blood
and
old
blood
upon
it
.
``
Where
yeh
been
,
*NL*
Henry
?
''
he
asked
.
He
continued
in
a
monotonous
voice
,
``
I
thought
mebbe
*NL*
yeh
got
keeled
over
.
There
's
been
thunder
t
'
pay
t
'
-
day
.
I
was
*NL*
worryin
'
about
it
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
still
lamented
.
``
Oh
,
Jim
--
oh
,
Jim
--
oh
,
Jim
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yeh
know
,
''
said
the
tall
soldier
,
``
I
was
out
there
.
''
He
made
a
*NL*
careful
gesture
.
``
An
'
,
Lord
,
what
a
circus
!
An
'
,
b
`
jiminey
,
I
got
*NL*
shot
--
I
got
shot
.
Yes
,
b
`
jiminey
,
I
got
shot
.
''
He
reiterated
this
*NL*
fact
in
a
bewildered
way
,
as
if
he
did
not
know
how
it
came
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
put
forth
anxious
arms
to
assist
him
,
but
the
tall
soldier
*NL*
went
firmly
on
as
if
propelled
.
Since
the
youth
's
arrival
as
a
*NL*
guardian
for
his
friend
,
the
other
wounded
men
had
ceased
to
display
*NL*
much
interest
.
They
occupied
themselves
again
in
dragging
their
own
*NL*
tragedies
toward
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
as
the
two
friends
marched
on
,
the
tall
soldier
seemed
to
be
*NL*
overcome
by
a
terror
.
His
face
turned
to
a
semblance
of
gray
paste
.
He
*NL*
clutched
the
youth
's
arm
and
looked
all
about
him
,
as
if
dreading
to
be
*NL*
overheard
.
Then
he
began
to
speak
in
a
shaking
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
yeh
what
I
'm
`
fraid
of
,
Henry
--
I
'll
tell
yeh
what
I
'm
`
fraid
*NL*
of
.
I
'm
`
fraid

'll
fall
down
--
an
'
then
yeh
know
--
them
damned
*NL*
artillery
wagons
--
they
like
as
not
'll
run
over
me
.
That
's
what
I
'm
*NL*
`
fraid
of
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
cried
out
to
him
hysterically
:
``
I
'll
take
care
of
yeh
,
Jim
!
*NL*
I
'll
take
care
of
yeh
!
I
swear
t
'
Gawd
I
will
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
--
will
yeh
,
Henry
?
''
the
tall
soldier
beseeched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
--
I
tell
yeh
--
I
'll
take
care
of
yeh
,
Jim
!
''
protested
the
*NL*
youth
.
He
could
not
speak
accurately
because
of
the
gulpings
in
his
*NL*
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
tall
soldier
continued
to
beg
in
a
lowly
way
.
He
now
hung
*NL*
babelike
to
the
youth
's
arm
.
His
eyes
rolled
in
the
wildness
of
his
*NL*
terror
.
``
I
was
allus
a
good
friend
t
'
yeh

I

do
it
fer

*NL*
Would

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
in
piteous
anxiety
to
await
his
friend
's
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
had
reached
an
anguish
where
the
sobs
scorched
him
.
He
*NL*
strove
to
express
his
loyalty
,
but
he
could
only
make
fantastic
*NL*
gestures
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
tall
soldier
seemed
suddenly
to
forget
all
those
fears
.
He
*NL*
became
again
the
grim
,
stalking
specter
of
a
soldier
.
He
went
stonily
*NL*
forward
.
The
youth
wished
his
friend
to
lean
upon
him
,
but
the
other
*NL*
always
shook
his
head
and
strangely
protested
.
``
No
--
no
--
no
--
leave
me
*NL*
be
--
leave
me
be
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
look
was
fixed
again
upon
the
unknown
.
He
moved
with
mysterious
*NL*
purpose
,
and
all
of
the
youth
's
offers
he
brushed
aside
.
``
No
--
no
--
leave
*NL*
me
be
--
leave
me
be
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
had
to
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
latter
heard
a
voice
talking
softly
near
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
Turning
he
saw
that
it
belonged
to
the
tattered
soldier
.
``
Ye
'd
better

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
knows
!
''
cried
the
youth
.
He
was
shaking
his
hands
helplessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
forward
presently
and
grasped
the
tall
soldier
by
the
arm
.
``
Jim
!
*NL*
Jim
!
''
he
coaxed
,
``
come
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
soldier
weakly
tried
to
wrench
himself
free
.
``
Huh
,
''
he
said
*NL*
vacantly
.
He
stared
at
the
youth
for
a
moment
.
At
last
he
spoke
as
if
*NL*
dimly
comprehending
.
``
Oh
!
Inteh
th
'
fields
?
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
blindly
through
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
turned
once
to
look
at
the
lashing
riders
and
jouncing
guns
*NL*
of
the
battery
.
He
was
startled
from
this
view
by
a
shrill
outcry
from
*NL*
the
tattered
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gawd
!
He
's
runnin
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
his
head
swiftly
,
the
youth
saw
his
friend
running
in
a
*NL*
staggering
and
stumbling
way
toward
a
little
clump
of
bushes
.
His
*NL*
heart
seemed
to
wrench
itself
almost
free
from
his
body
at
this
sight
.
*NL*
He
made
a
noise
of
pain
.
He
and
the
tattered
man
began
a
pursuit
.
There
*NL*
was
a
singular
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
overtook
the
tall
soldier
he
began
to
plead
with
all
the
words
*NL*
he
could
find
.
``
Jim
--
Jim
--
what
are
you
doing
--
what
makes
you
do
this
*NL*
way
--
you
'll
hurt
yerself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
purpose
was
in
the
tall
soldier
's
face
.
He
protested
in
a
*NL*
dulled
way
,
keeping
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
mystic
place
of
his
*NL*
intentions
.
``
No
--
no
--
do
n't
tech
me
--
leave
me
be
--
leave
me
be
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
aghast
and
filled
with
wonder
at
the
tall
soldier
,
began
*NL*
quaveringly
to
question
him
.
``
Where
yeh
goin

,
Jim
?
What
you
thinking
*NL*
about
?
Where
you
going
?
Tell
me
,
wo
n't
you
,
Jim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
soldier
faced
about
as
upon
relentless
pursuers
.
In
his
eyes
*NL*
there
was
a
great
appeal
.
``
Leave
me
be
,
ca
n't
yeh
?
Leave
me
be
fer
a
*NL*
minnit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
recoiled
.
``
Why
,
Jim
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
dazed
way
,
``
what
's
the
*NL*
matter
with
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
soldier
turned
and
,
lurching
dangerously
,
went
on
.
The
youth
*NL*
and
the
tattered
soldier
followed
,
sneaking
as
if
whipped
,
feeling
*NL*
unable
to
face
the
stricken
man
if
he
should
again
confront
them
.
They
*NL*
began
to
have
thoughts
of
a
solemn
ceremony
.
There
was
something
*NL*
rite-like
in
these
movements
of
the
doomed
soldier
.
And
there
was
a
*NL*
resemblance
in
him
to
a
devotee
of
a
mad
religion
,
blood-sucking
,
*NL*
muscle-wrenching
,
bone-crushing
.
They
were
awed
and
afraid
.
They
hung
*NL*
back
lest
he
have
at
command
a
dreadful
weapon
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
they
saw
him
stop
and
stand
motionless
.
Hastening
up
,
they
*NL*
perceived
that
his
face
wore
an
expression
telling
that
he
had
at
last
*NL*
found
the
place
for
which
he
had
struggled
.
His
spare
figure
was
*NL*
erect
;
his
bloody
hands
were
quietly
at
his
side
.
He
was
waiting
with
*NL*
patience
for
something
that
he
had
come
to
meet
.
He
was
at
the
*NL*
rendezvous
.
They
paused
and
stood
,
expectant
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
the
chest
of
the
doomed
soldier
began
to
heave
with
a
strained
*NL*
motion
.
It
increased
in
violence
until
it
was
as
if
an
animal
was
*NL*
within
and
was
kicking
and
tumbling
furiously
to
be
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
spectacle
of
gradual
strangulation
made
the
youth
writhe
,
and
once
*NL*
as
his
friend
rolled
his
eyes
,
he
saw
something
in
them
that
made
him
*NL*
sink
wailing
to
the
ground
.
He
raised
his
voice
in
a
last
supreme
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
--
Jim
--
Jim
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
soldier
opened
his
lips
and
spoke
.
He
made
a
gesture
.
``
Leave
*NL*
me
be
--
do
n't
tech
me
--
leave
me
be
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
silence
while
he
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
his
form
stiffened
and
straightened
.
Then
it
was
shaken
by
a
*NL*
prolonged
ague
.
He
stared
into
space
.
To
the
two
watchers
there
was
a
*NL*
curious
and
profound
dignity
in
the
firm
lines
of
his
awful
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
invaded
by
a
creeping
strangeness
that
slowly
enveloped
him
.
For
*NL*
a
moment
the
tremor
of
his
legs
caused
him
to
dance
a
sort
of
hideous
*NL*
hornpipe
.
His
arms
beat
wildly
about
his
head
in
expression
of
implike
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
tall
figure
stretched
itself
to
its
full
height
.
There
was
a
slight
*NL*
rending
sound
.
Then
it
began
to
swing
forward
,
slow
and
straight
,
in
*NL*
the
manner
of
a
falling
tree
.
A
swift
muscular
contortion
made
the
*NL*
left
shoulder
strike
the
ground
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
body
seemed
to
bounce
a
little
way
from
the
earth
.
``
God
!
''
said
the
*NL*
tattered
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
had
watched
,
spellbound
,
this
ceremony
at
the
place
of
*NL*
meeting
.
His
face
had
been
twisted
into
an
expression
of
every
agony
*NL*
he
had
imagined
for
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
sprang
to
his
feet
and
,
going
closer
,
gazed
upon
the
pastelike
*NL*
face
.
The
mouth
was
open
and
the
teeth
showed
in
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
flap
of
the
blue
jacket
fell
away
from
the
body
,
he
could
see
*NL*
that
the
side
looked
as
if
it
had
been
chewed
by
wolves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
turned
,
with
sudden
,
livid
rage
,
toward
the
battlefield
.
He
*NL*
shook
his
fist
.
He
seemed
about
to
deliver
a
philippic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hell
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
red
sun
was
pasted
in
the
sky
like
a
wafer

CHAPTER
X
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tattered
man
stood
musing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
was
reg
`
lar
jim-dandy
fer
nerve
,
wa
'n'
t

''
said
he
finally
*NL*
in
a
little
awestruck
voice
.
``
A
reg
`
lar
jim-dandy
.
''
He
thoughtfully
*NL*
poked
one
of
the
docile
hands
with
his
foot
.
``
I
wonner
where
he
got
*NL*
`
is
stre
n'th
from

I
never
seen
a
man
do
like
that
before
.
It
was
a
*NL*
funny
thing
.
Well
,
he
was
a
reg
`
lar
jim-dandy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
desired
to
screech
out
his
grief
.
He
was
stabbed
,
but
his
*NL*
tongue
lay
dead
in
the
tomb
of
his
mouth
.
He
threw
himself
again
upon
*NL*
the
ground
and
began
to
brood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tattered
man
stood
musing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look-a-here
,
pardner
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
time
.
He
regarded
the
corpse
*NL*
as
he
spoke
.
``
He
's
up
an
'
gone
,
ai
n't

Nobody

An

I
must
say
I
ai
n't
enjoying
any
great
health
m
`
self
these
*NL*
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
awakened
by
the
tattered
soldier
's
tone
,
looked
quickly
up
.
*NL*
He
saw
that
he
was
swinging
uncertainly
on
his
legs
and
that
his
face
*NL*
had
turned
to
a
shade
of
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
''
he
cried
,
``
you
ai
n't
goin
'
t
'
--
not
you
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tattered
man
waved
his
hand
.
``
Nary
die
,
''
he
said
.
``
All
I
want
is
*NL*
some
pea
soup
an
'
a
good
bed
.
Some
pea
soup
,
''
he
repeated
dreamfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
arose
from
the
ground
.
``
I
wonder
where
he
came
from
.
I
left
*NL*
him
over
there
.
''
He
pointed
.
``
And
now
I
find
`
im
here
.
And
he
was
*NL*
coming
from
over
there
,
too
.
''
He
indicated
a
new
direction
.
They
both
*NL*
turned
toward
the
body
as
if
to
ask
of
it
a
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
at
length
spoke
the
tattered
man
,
``
there
ai
n't
no
use
in
our
*NL*
stayin
'
here
an
'
tryin
'
t
'
ask
him
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
nodded
an
assent
wearily
.
They
both
turned
to
gaze
for
a
*NL*
moment
at
the
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
murmured
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
was
a
jim-dandy
,
wa
'n'
t
`
e
?
''
said
the
tattered
man
as
if
in
*NL*
response
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
their
backs
upon
it
and
started
away
.
For
a
time
they
*NL*
stole
softly
,
treading
with
their
toes
.
It
remained
laughing
there
in
*NL*
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
commencin
'
t
'
feel
pretty
bad
,
''
said
the
tattered
man
,
suddenly
*NL*
breaking
one
of
his
little
silences
.
``
I
'm
commencin
'
t
'
feel
pretty
*NL*
damn
'
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
groaned
.
``
O
Lord
!
''
He
wondered
if
he
was
to
be
the
tortured
*NL*
witness
of
another
grim
encounter
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
companion
waved
his
hand
reassuringly
.
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
goin

t
'
*NL*
die

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
glancing
at
his
companion
could
see
by
the
shadow
of
a
smile
*NL*
that
he
was
making
some
kind
of
fun
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
plodded
on
the
tattered
soldier
continued
to
talk
.
``
Besides

I

*NL*
Then
he
made
a
calm
announcement
:
``

They
went
slowly

*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
had
been
wriggling
since
the
introduction
of
this
topic
.
He
*NL*
now
gave
a
cry
of
exasperation
and
made
a
furious
motion
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
Oh

do
n't
bother

''
he
said
.
He
was
enraged
against
the
tattered
*NL*
man
,
and
could
have
strangled
him
.
His
companions
seemed
ever
to
play
*NL*
intolerable
parts
.
They
were
ever
upraising
the
ghost
of
shame
on
the
*NL*
stick
of
their
curiosity

He
turned
toward
the
tattered
man
as
one
at
*NL*
bay

``
Now

repeated
with
desperate
menace

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the

There
*NL*
was
a
little
accent
of
despair
in
his
voice
as
he
replied
,
``

The
youth
,
who
had
been
holding
a
bitter
debate
with
himself
and
*NL*
casting
glances
of
hatred
and
contempt
at
the
tattered
man

here
spoke
*NL*
in
a
hard
voice

``
Good-by

The

at

in
gaping
amazement

``
Why

he
asked
unsteadily

The
youth
looking
at
*NL*
him
,
could
see
that
he
,
too
,
like
that
other
one
,
was
beginning
to
act
*NL*
dumb
and
animal-like

His
thoughts
seemed
to
be
floundering
about
in

his
head

``

said
the

rambling
on
in

idiot
fashion

His
head
was
hanging
forward

his
words
were
*NL*
slurred

In
reply
the
youth
climbed
a
fence
and
started
away
.
He
could
hear
the
*NL*
tattered
man
bleating
plaintively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
faced
about
angrily
.
``

a
distance
he
saw
the
tattered
man
*NL*
wandering
about
helplessly
in
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
thought
that
he
wished
he
was
dead
.
He
believed
that
he
envied
*NL*
those
men
whose
bodies
lay
strewn
over
the
grass
of
the
fields
and
on
*NL*
the
fallen
leaves
of
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
simple
questions
of
the
tattered
man
had
been
knife
thrusts
to
him
.
*NL*
They
asserted
a
society
that
probes
pitilessly
at
secrets
until
all
is
*NL*
apparent
.
His
late
companion
's
chance
persistency
made
him
feel
that
*NL*
he
could
not
keep
his
crime
concealed
in
his
bosom
.
It
was
sure
to
be
*NL*
brought
plain
by
one
of
those
arrows
which
cloud
the
air
and
are
*NL*
constantly
pricking
,
discovering
,
proclaiming
those
things
which
are
*NL*
willed
to
be
forever
hidden
.
He
admitted
that
he
could
not
defend
*NL*
himself
against
this
agency
.
It
was
not
within
the
power
of
vigilance
.

CHAPTER
XI
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
aware
that
the
furnace
roar
of
the
battle
was
growing
louder
.
*NL*
Great
brown
clouds
had
floated
to
the
still
heights
of
air
before
him
.
*NL*
The
noise
,
too
,
was
approaching
.
The
woods
filtered
men
and
the
fields
*NL*
became
dotted
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
rounded
a
hillock
,
he
perceived
that
the
roadway
was
now
a
crying
*NL*
mass
of
wagons
,
teams
,
and
men
.
From
the
heaving
tangle
issued
*NL*
exhortations
,
commands
,
imprecations
.
Fear
was
sweeping
it
all
along
.
*NL*
The
cracking
whips
bit
and
horses
plunged
and
tugged
.
The
white-topped
*NL*
wagons
strained
and
stumbled
in
their
exertions
like
fat
sheep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
felt
comforted
in
a
measure
by
this
sight
.
They
were
all
*NL*
retreating
.
Perhaps
,
then
,
he
was
not
so
bad
after
all
.
He
seated
*NL*
himself
and
watched
the
terror-stricken
wagons
.
They
fled
like
soft
,
*NL*
ungainly
animals
.
All
the
roarers
and
lashers
served
to
help
him
to
*NL*
magnify
the
dangers
and
horrors
of
the
engagement
that
he
might
try
to
*NL*
prove
to
himself
that
the
thing
with
which
men
could
charge
him
was
in
*NL*
truth
a
symmetrical
act
.
There
was
an
amount
of
pleasure
to
him
in
*NL*
watching
the
wild
march
of
this
vindication
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
calm
head
of
a
forward-going
column
of
infantry
appeared
*NL*
in
the
road
.
It
came
swiftly
on
.
Avoiding
the
obstructions
gave
it
*NL*
the
sinuous
movement
of
a
serpent
.
The
men
at
the
head
butted
mules
*NL*
with
their
musket
stocks
.
They
prodded
teamsters
indifferent
to
all
*NL*
howls
.
The
men
forced
their
way
through
parts
of
the
dense
mass
by
*NL*
strength
.
The
blunt
head
of
the
column
pushed
.
The
raving
teamsters
*NL*
swore
many
strange
oaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commands
to
make
way
had
the
ring
of
a
great
importance
in
them
.
*NL*
The
men
were
going
forward
to
the
heart
of
the
din
.
They
were
to
*NL*
confront
the
eager
rush
of
the
enemy
.
They
felt
the
pride
of
their
*NL*
onward
movement
when
the
remainder
of
the
army
seemed
trying
to
dribble
*NL*
down
this
road
.
They
tumbled
teams
about
with
a
fine
feeling
that
it
*NL*
was
no
matter
so
long
as
their
column
got
to
the
front
in
time
.
This
*NL*
importance
made
their
faces
grave
and
stern
.
And
the
backs
of
the
*NL*
officers
were
very
rigid
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
youth
looked
at
them
the
black
weight
of
his
woe
returned
to
*NL*
him
.
He
felt
that
he
was
regarding
a
procession
of
chosen
beings
.
The
*NL*
separation
was
as
great
to
him
as
if
they
had
marched
with
weapons
of
*NL*
flame
and
banners
of
sunlight
.
He
could
never
be
like
them
.
He
could
*NL*
have
wept
in
his
longings
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
searched
about
in
his
mind
for
an
adequate
malediction
for
the
*NL*
indefinite
cause
,
the
thing
upon
which
men
turn
the
words
of
final
*NL*
blame
.
It
--
whatever
it
was
--
was
responsible
for
him
,
he
said
.
There
*NL*
lay
the
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
haste
of
the
column
to
reach
the
battle
seemed
to
the
forlorn
young
*NL*
man
to
be
something
much
finer
than
stout
fighting
.
Heroes
,
he
*NL*
thought
,
could
find
excuses
in
that
long
seething
lane
.
They
could
*NL*
retire
with
perfect
self-respect
and
make
excuses
to
the
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
what
those
men
had
eaten
that
they
could
be
in
such
haste
*NL*
to
force
their
way
to
grim
chances
of
death
.
As
he
watched
his
envy
*NL*
grew
until
he
thought
that
he
wished
to
change
lives
with
one
of
them
.
*NL*
He
would
have
liked
to
have
used
a
tremendous
force
,
he
said
,
throw
off
*NL*
himself
and
become
a
better
.
Swift
pictures
of
himself
,
apart
,
yet
in
*NL*
himself
,
came
to
him
--
a
blue
desperate
figure
leading
lurid
charges
*NL*
with
one
knee
forward
and
a
broken
blade
high
--
a
blue
,
determined
*NL*
figure
standing
before
a
crimson
and
steel
assault
,
getting
calmly
*NL*
killed
on
a
high
place
before
the
eyes
of
all
.
He
thought
of
the
*NL*
magnificent
pathos
of
his
dead
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
thoughts
uplifted
him
.
He
felt
the
quiver
of
war
desire
.
In
his
*NL*
ears
,
he
heard
the
ring
of
victory
.
He
knew
the
frenzy
of
a
rapid
*NL*
successful
charge
.
The
music
of
the
trampling
feet
,
the
sharp
voices
,
*NL*
the
clanking
arms
of
the
column
near
him
made
him
soar
on
the
red
wings
*NL*
of
war
.
For
a
few
moments
he
was
sublime
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
that
he
was
about
to
start
for
the
front
.
Indeed
,
he
saw
a
*NL*
picture
of
himself
,
dust-stained
,
haggard
,
panting
,
flying
to
the
front
*NL*
at
the
proper
moment
to
seize
and
throttle
the
dark
,
leering
witch
of
*NL*
calamity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
difficulties
of
the
thing
began
to
drag
at
him
.
He
hesitated
,
*NL*
balancing
awkwardly
on
one
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
rifle
;
he
could
not
fight
with
his
hands
,
said
he
resentfully
*NL*
to
his
plan
.
Well
,
rifles
could
be
had
for
the
picking
.
They
were
*NL*
extraordinarily
profuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Also
,
he
continued
,
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
he
found
his
regiment
.
*NL*
Well
,
he
could
fight
with
any
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
forward
slowly
.
He
stepped
as
if
he
expected
to
tread
upon
*NL*
some
explosive
thing
.
Doubts
and
he
were
struggling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
truly
be
a
worm
if
any
of
his
comrades
should
see
him
*NL*
returning
thus
,
the
marks
of
his
flight
upon
him
.
There
was
a
reply
*NL*
that
the
intent
fighters
did
not
care
for
what
happened
rearward
saving
*NL*
that
no
hostile
bayonets
appeared
there
.
In
the
battle-blur
his
face
*NL*
would
,
in
a
way
be
hidden
,
like
the
face
of
a
cowled
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
he
said
that
his
tireless
fate
would
bring
forth
,
when
the
*NL*
strife
lulled
for
a
moment
,
a
man
to
ask
of
him
an
explanation
.
In
*NL*
imagination
he
felt
the
scrutiny
of
his
companions
as
he
painfully
*NL*
labored
through
some
lies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eventually
,
his
courage
expended
itself
upon
these
objections
.
The
*NL*
debates
drained
him
of
his
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
cast
down
by
this
defeat
of
his
plan
,
for
,
upon
studying
the
*NL*
affair
carefully
,
he
could
not
but
admit
that
the
objections
were
very
*NL*
formidable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Furthermore
,
various
ailments
had
begun
to
cry
out
.
In
their
presence
*NL*
he
could
not
persist
in
flying
high
with
the
wings
of
war
;
they
*NL*
rendered
it
almost
impossible
for
him
to
see
himself
in
a
heroic
light
.
*NL*
He
tumbled
headlong
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
discovered
that
he
had
a
scorching
thirst
.
His
face
was
so
dry
and
*NL*
grimy
that
he
thought
he
could
feel
his
skin
crackle
.
Each
bone
of
his
*NL*
body
had
an
ache
in
it
,
and
seemingly
threatened
to
break
with
each
*NL*
movement
.
His
feet
were
like
two
sores
.
Also
,
his
body
was
calling
*NL*
for
food
.
It
was
more
powerful
than
a
direct
hunger
.
There
was
a
dull
,
*NL*
weight
like
feeling
in
his
stomach
,
and
,
when
he
tried
to
walk
,
his
*NL*
head
swayed
and
he
tottered
.
He
could
not
see
with
distinctness
.
Small
*NL*
patches
of
green
mist
floated
before
his
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
had
been
tossed
by
many
emotions
,
he
had
not
been
aware
of
*NL*
ailments
.
Now
they
beset
him
and
made
clamor
.
As
he
was
at
last
*NL*
compelled
to
pay
attention
to
them
,
his
capacity
for
self-hate
was
*NL*
multiplied
.
In
despair
,
he
declared
that
he
was
not
like
those
others
.
*NL*
He
now
conceded
it
to
be
impossible
that
he
should
ever
become
a
hero
.
*NL*
He
was
a
craven
loon
.
Those
pictures
of
glory
were
piteous
things
.
He
*NL*
groaned
from
his
heart
and
went
staggering
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
mothlike
quality
within
him
kept
him
in
the
vicinity
of
the
*NL*
battle
.
He
had
a
great
desire
to
see
,
and
to
get
news
.
He
wished
to
*NL*
know
who
was
winning
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
himself
that
,
despite
his
unprecedented
suffering
,
he
had
never
*NL*
lost
his
greed
for
a
victory
,
yet
,
he
said
,
in
a
half-apologetic
manner
*NL*
to
his
conscience
,
he
could
not
but
know
that
a
defeat
for
the
army
*NL*
this
time
might
mean
many
favorable
things
for
him
.
The
blows
of
the
*NL*
enemy
would
splinter
regiments
into
fragments
.
Thus
,
many
men
of
*NL*
courage
,
he
considered
,
would
be
obliged
to
desert
the
colors
and
*NL*
scurry
like
chickens
.
He
would
appear
as
one
of
them
.
They
would
be
*NL*
sullen
brothers
in
distress
,
and
he
could
then
easily
believe
he
had
*NL*
not
run
any
farther
or
faster
than
they
.
And
if
he
himself
could
*NL*
believe
in
his
virtuous
perfection
,
he
conceived
that
there
would
be
*NL*
small
trouble
in
convincing
all
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
,
as
if
in
excuse
for
this
hope
,
that
previously
the
army
had
*NL*
encountered
great
defeats
and
in
a
few
months
had
shaken
off
all
blood
*NL*
and
tradition
of
them
,
emerging
as
bright
and
valiant
as
a
new
one
;
*NL*
thrusting
out
of
sight
the
memory
of
disaster
,
and
appearing
with
the
*NL*
valor
and
confidence
of
unconquered
legions
.
The
shrilling
voices
of
*NL*
the
people
at
home
would
pipe
dismally
for
a
time
,
but
various
generals
*NL*
were
usually
compelled
to
listen
to
these
ditties
.
He
of
course
felt
no
*NL*
compunctions
for
proposing
a
general
as
a
sacrifice
.
He
could
not
tell
*NL*
who
the
chosen
for
the
barbs
might
be
,
so
he
could
center
no
direct
*NL*
sympathy
upon
him
.
The
people
were
afar
and
he
did
not
conceive
public
*NL*
opinion
to
be
accurate
at
long
range
.
It
was
quite
probable
they
would
*NL*
hit
the
wrong
man
who
,
after
he
had
recovered
from
his
amazement
would
*NL*
perhaps
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
in
writing
replies
to
the
songs
of
*NL*
his
alleged
failure
.
It
would
be
very
unfortunate
,
no
doubt
,
but
in
*NL*
this
case
a
general
was
of
no
consequence
to
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
defeat
there
would
be
a
roundabout
vindication
of
himself
.
He
*NL*
thought
it
would
prove
,
in
a
manner
,
that
he
had
fled
early
because
of
*NL*
his
superior
powers
of
perception
.
A
serious
prophet
upon
predicting
a
*NL*
flood
should
be
the
first
man
to
climb
a
tree
.
This
would
demonstrate
*NL*
that
he
was
indeed
a
seer
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moral
vindication
was
regarded
by
the
youth
as
a
very
important
*NL*
thing
.
Without
salve
,
he
could
not
,
he
thought
,
wear
the
sore
badge
of
*NL*
his
dishonor
through
life
.
With
his
heart
continually
assuring
him
*NL*
that
he
was
despicable
,
he
could
not
exist
without
making
it
,
through
*NL*
his
actions
,
apparent
to
all
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
army
had
gone
gloriously
on
he
would
be
lost
.
If
the
din
meant
*NL*
that
now
his
army
's
flags
were
tilted
forward
he
was
a
condemned
*NL*
wretch
.
He
would
be
compelled
to
doom
himself
to
isolation
.
If
the
*NL*
men
were
advancing
,
their
indifferent
feet
were
trampling
upon
his
*NL*
chances
for
a
successful
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
these
thoughts
went
rapidly
through
his
mind
,
he
turned
upon
them
*NL*
and
tried
to
thrust
them
away
.
He
denounced
himself
as
a
villain
.
He
*NL*
said
that
he
was
the
most
unutterably
selfish
man
in
existence
.
His
*NL*
mind
pictured
the
soldiers
who
would
place
their
defiant
bodies
before
*NL*
the
spear
of
the
yelling
battle
fiend
,
and
as
he
saw
their
dripping
*NL*
corpses
on
an
imagined
field
,
he
said
that
he
was
their
murderer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
thought
that
he
wished
he
was
dead
.
He
believed
that
he
envied
*NL*
a
corpse
.
Thinking
of
the
slain
,
he
achieved
a
great
contempt
for
some
*NL*
of
them
,
as
if
they
were
guilty
for
thus
becoming
lifeless
.
They
might
*NL*
have
been
killed
by
lucky
chances
,
he
said
,
before
they
had
had
*NL*
opportunities
to
flee
or
before
they
had
been
really
tested
.
Yet
they
*NL*
would
receive
laurels
from
tradition
.
He
cried
out
bitterly
that
their
*NL*
crowns
were
stolen
and
their
robes
of
glorious
memories
were
shams
.
*NL*
However
,
he
still
said
that
it
was
a
great
pity
he
was
not
as
they
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
defeat
of
the
army
had
suggested
itself
to
him
as
a
means
of
escape
*NL*
from
the
consequences
of
his
fall
.
He
considered
,
now
,
however
,
that
*NL*
it
was
useless
to
think
of
such
a
possibility
.
His
education
had
been
*NL*
that
success
for
that
mighty
blue
machine
was
certain
;
that
it
would
*NL*
make
victories
as
a
contrivance
turns
out
buttons
.
He
presently
*NL*
discarded
all
his
speculations
in
the
other
direction
.
He
returned
to
*NL*
the
creed
of
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
perceived
again
that
it
was
not
possible
for
the
army
to
be
*NL*
defeated
,
he
tried
to
bethink
him
of
a
fine
tale
which
he
could
take
*NL*
back
to
his
regiment
,
and
with
it
turn
the
expected
shafts
of
derision
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
he
mortally
feared
these
shafts
,
it
became
impossible
for
him
*NL*
to
invent
a
tale
he
felt
he
could
trust
.
He
experimented
with
many
*NL*
schemes
,
but
threw
them
aside
one
by
one
as
flimsy
.
He
was
quick
to
*NL*
see
vulnerable
places
in
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Furthermore
,
he
was
much
afraid
that
some
arrow
of
scorn
might
lay
him
*NL*
mentally
low
before
he
could
raise
his
protecting
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
imagined
the
whole
regiment
saying
:
``
Where
's
Henry
Fleming
?
He
run
,
*NL*
did
n't
`
e
?
Oh
,
my
!
''
He
recalled
various
persons
who
would
be
quite
*NL*
sure
to
leave
him
no
peace
about
it
.
They
would
doubtless
question
him
*NL*
with
sneers
,
and
laugh
at
his
stammering
hesitation
.
In
the
next
*NL*
engagement
they
would
try
to
keep
watch
of
him
to
discover
when
he
*NL*
would
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wherever
he
went
in
camp
,
he
would
encounter
insolent
and
lingeringly
*NL*
cruel
stares
.
As
he
imagined
himself
passing
near
a
crowd
of
comrades
,
*NL*
he
could
hear
some
one
say
,
``
There
he
goes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
if
the
heads
were
moved
by
one
muscle
,
all
the
faces
were
*NL*
turned
toward
him
with
wide
,
derisive
grins
.
He
seemed
to
hear
some
*NL*
one
make
a
humorous
remark
in
a
low
tone
.
At
it
the
others
all
crowed
*NL*
and
cackled
.
He
was
a
slang
phrase
.

CHAPTER
XII
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
column
that
had
butted
stoutly
at
the
obstacles
in
the
roadway
was
*NL*
barely
out
of
the
youth
's
sight
before
he
saw
dark
waves
of
men
come
*NL*
sweeping
out
of
the
woods
and
down
through
the
fields
.
He
knew
at
once
*NL*
that
the
steel
fibers
had
been
washed
from
their
hearts
.
They
were
*NL*
bursting
from
their
coats
and
their
equipments
as
from
entanglements
.
*NL*
They
charged
down
upon
him
like
terrified
buffaloes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
them
blue
smoke
curled
and
clouded
above
the
treetops
,
and
*NL*
through
the
thickets
he
could
sometimes
see
a
distant
pink
glare
.
The
*NL*
voices
of
the
cannon
were
clamoring
in
interminable
chorus
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
was
horrorstricken
.
He
stared
in
agony
and
amazement
.
He
*NL*
forgot
that
he
was
engaged
in
combating
the
universe
.
He
threw
aside
*NL*
his
mental
pamphlets
on
the
philosophy
of
the
retreated
and
rules
for
*NL*
the
guidance
of
the
damned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fight
was
lost
.
The
dragons
were
coming
with
invincible
strides
.
*NL*
The
army
,
helpless
in
the
matted
thickets
and
blinded
by
the
*NL*
overhanging
night
,
was
going
to
be
swallowed
.
War
,
the
red
animal
,
*NL*
war
,
the
blood-swollen
god
,
would
have
bloated
fill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
him
something
bade
to
cry
out
.
He
had
the
impulse
to
make
a
*NL*
rallying
speech
,
to
sing
a
battle
hymn
,
but
he
could
only
get
his
*NL*
tongue
to
call
into
the
air
:
``
Why
--
why
--
what
--
what
's
th
'
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
he
was
in
the
midst
of
them
.
They
were
leaping
and
scampering
all
*NL*
about
him
.
Their
blanched
faces
shone
in
the
dusk
.
They
seemed
,
for
*NL*
the
most
part
,
to
be
very
burly
men
.
The
youth
turned
from
one
to
*NL*
another
of
them
as
they
galloped
along
.
His
incoherent
questions
were
*NL*
lost
.
They
were
heedless
of
his
appeals
.
They
did
not
seem
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sometimes
gabbled
insanely
.
One
huge
man
was
asking
of
the
sky
:
*NL*
``
Say
,
where
de
plank
road
?
Where
de
plank
road
!
''
It
was
as
if
he
had
*NL*
lost
a
child
.
He
wept
in
his
pain
and
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
men
were
running
hither
and
thither
in
all
ways
.
The
*NL*
artillery
booming
,
forward
,
rearward
,
and
on
the
flanks
made
jumble
of
*NL*
ideas
of
direction
.
Landmarks
had
vanished
into
the
gathered
gloom
.
*NL*
The
youth
began
to
imagine
that
he
had
got
into
the
center
of
the
*NL*
tremendous
quarrel
,
and
he
could
perceive
no
way
out
of
it
.
From
the
*NL*
mouths
of
the
fleeing
men
came
a
thousand
wild
questions
,
but
no
one
*NL*
made
answers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
after
rushing
about
and
throwing
interrogations
at
the
*NL*
heedless
bands
of
retreating
infantry
,
finally
clutched
a
man
by
the
*NL*
arm
.
They
swung
around
face
to
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
why
--
''
stammered
the
youth
struggling
with
his
balking
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
screamed
:
``
Let
go
me
!
Let
go
me
!
''
His
face
was
livid
and
his
*NL*
eyes
were
rolling
uncontrolled
.
He
was
heaving
and
panting
.
He
still
*NL*
grasped
his
rifle
,
perhaps
having
forgotten
to
release
his
hold
upon
*NL*
it
.
He
tugged
frantically
,
and
the
youth
being
compelled
to
lean
*NL*
forward
was
dragged
several
paces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
go
me
!
Let
go
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
why
--
''
stuttered
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
!
''
bawled
the
man
in
a
lurid
rage
.
He
adroitly
and
fiercely
*NL*
swung
his
rifle
.
It
crushed
upon
the
youth
's
head
.
The
man
ran
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
's
fingers
had
turned
to
paste
upon
the
other
's
arm
.
The
*NL*
energy
was
smitten
from
his
muscles
.
He
saw
the
flaming
wings
of
*NL*
lightning
flash
before
his
vision
.
There
was
a
deafening
rumble
of
*NL*
thunder
within
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
his
legs
seemed
to
die
.
He
sank
writhing
to
the
ground
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
arise
.
In
his
efforts
against
the
numbing
pain
he
was
like
a
*NL*
man
wrestling
with
a
creature
of
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sinister
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
he
would
achieve
a
position
half
erect
,
battle
with
the
air
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
and
then
fall
again
,
grabbing
at
the
grass
.
His
face
was
*NL*
of
a
clammy
pallor
.
Deep
groans
were
wrenched
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
with
a
twisting
movement
,
he
got
upon
his
hands
and
knees
,
and
*NL*
from
thence
,
like
a
babe
trying
to
walk
,
to
his
feet
.
Pressing
his
*NL*
hands
to
his
temples
he
went
lurching
over
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fought
an
intense
battle
with
his
body
.
His
dulled
senses
wished
him
*NL*
to
swoon
and
he
opposed
them
stubbornly
,
his
mind
portraying
unknown
*NL*
dangers
and
mutilations
if
he
should
fall
upon
the
field
.
He
went
tall
*NL*
soldier
fashion
.
He
imagined
secluded
spots
where
he
could
fall
and
be
*NL*
unmolested
.
To
search
for
one
he
strove
against
the
tide
of
his
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
put
his
hand
to
the
top
of
his
head
and
timidly
touched
the
*NL*
wound
.
The
scratching
pain
of
the
contact
made
him
draw
a
long
breath
*NL*
through
his
clinched
teeth
.
His
fingers
were
dabbled
with
blood
.
He
*NL*
regarded
them
with
a
fixed
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Around
him
he
could
hear
the
grumble
of
jolted
cannon
as
the
scurrying
*NL*
horses
were
lashed
toward
the
front
.
Once
,
a
young
officer
on
a
*NL*
besplashed
charger
nearly
ran
him
down
.
He
turned
and
watched
the
mass
*NL*
of
guns
,
men
,
and
horses
sweeping
in
a
wide
curve
toward
a
gap
in
a
*NL*
fence
.
The
officer
was
making
excited
motions
with
a
gauntleted
hand
.
*NL*
The
guns
followed
the
teams
with
an
air
of
unwillingness
,
of
being
*NL*
dragged
by
the
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
officers
of
the
scattered
infantry
were
cursing
and
railing
like
*NL*
fishwives
.
Their
scolding
voices
could
be
heard
above
the
din
.
Into
*NL*
the
unspeakable
jumble
in
the
roadway
rode
a
squadron
of
cavalry
.
The
*NL*
faded
yellow
of
their
facings
shone
bravely
.
There
was
a
mighty
*NL*
altercation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
artillery
were
assembling
as
if
for
a
conference
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blue
haze
of
evening
was
upon
the
field
.
The
lines
of
forest
were
*NL*
long
purple
shadows
.
One
cloud
lay
along
the
western
sky
partly
*NL*
smothering
the
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
youth
left
the
scene
behind
him
,
he
heard
the
guns
suddenly
roar
*NL*
out
.
He
imagined
them
shaking
in
black
rage
.
They
belched
and
howled
*NL*
like
brass
devils
guarding
a
gate
.
The
soft
air
was
filled
with
the
*NL*
tremendous
remonstrance
.
With
it
came
the
shattering
peal
of
opposing
*NL*
infantry
.
Turning
to
look
behind
him
,
he
could
see
sheets
of
orange
*NL*
light
illumine
the
shadowy
distance
.
There
were
subtle
and
sudden
*NL*
lightnings
in
the
far
air
.
At
times
he
thought
he
could
see
heaving
*NL*
masses
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hurried
on
in
the
dusk
.
The
day
had
faded
until
he
could
barely
*NL*
distinguish
place
for
his
feet
.
The
purple
darkness
was
filled
with
*NL*
men
who
lectured
and
jabbered
.
Sometimes
he
could
see
them
*NL*
gesticulating
against
the
blue
and
somber
sky
.
There
seemed
to
be
a
*NL*
great
ruck
of
men
and
munitions
spread
about
in
the
forest
and
in
the
*NL*
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
narrow
roadway
now
lay
lifeless
.
There
were
overturned
*NL*
wagons
like
sun-dried
bowlders
.
The
bed
of
the
former
torrent
was
*NL*
choked
with
the
bodies
of
horses
and
splintered
parts
of
war
machines
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
come
to
pass
that
his
wound
pained
him
but
little
.
He
was
*NL*
afraid
to
move
rapidly
,
however
,
for
a
dread
of
disturbing
it
.
He
held
*NL*
his
head
very
still
and
took
many
precautions
against
stumbling
.
He
*NL*
was
filled
with
anxiety
,
and
his
face
was
pinched
and
drawn
in
*NL*
anticipation
of
the
pain
of
any
sudden
mistake
of
his
feet
in
the
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
thoughts
,
as
he
walked
,
fixed
intently
upon
his
hurt
.
There
was
a
*NL*
cool
,
liquid
feeling
about
it
and
he
imagined
blood
moving
slowly
down
*NL*
under
his
hair
.
His
head
seemed
swollen
to
a
size
that
made
him
think
*NL*
his
neck
to
be
inadequate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
silence
of
his
wound
made
much
worriment
.
The
little
*NL*
blistering
voices
of
pain
that
had
called
out
from
his
scalp
were
,
he
*NL*
thought
,
definite
in
their
expression
of
danger
.
By
them
he
believed
*NL*
that
he
could
measure
his
plight
.
But
when
they
remained
ominously
*NL*
silent
he
became
frightened
and
imagined
terrible
fingers
that
clutched
*NL*
into
his
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
it
he
began
to
reflect
upon
various
incidents
and
conditions
of
*NL*
the
past
.
He
bethought
him
of
certain
meals
his
mother
had
cooked
at
*NL*
home
,
in
which
those
dishes
of
which
he
was
particularly
fond
had
*NL*
occupied
prominent
positions
.
He
saw
the
spread
table
.
The
pine
walls
*NL*
of
the
kitchen
were
glowing
in
the
warm
light
from
the
stove
.
Too
,
he
*NL*
remembered
how
he
and
his
companions
used
to
go
from
the
schoolhouse
to
*NL*
the
bank
of
a
shaded
pool
.
He
saw
his
clothes
in
disorderly
array
upon
*NL*
the
grass
of
the
bank
.
He
felt
the
swash
of
the
fragrant
water
upon
*NL*
his
body
.
The
leaves
of
the
overhanging
maple
rustled
with
melody
in
*NL*
the
wind
of
youthful
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
overcome
presently
by
a
dragging
weariness
.
His
head
hung
*NL*
forward
and
his
shoulders
were
stooped
as
if
he
were
bearing
a
great
*NL*
bundle
.
His
feet
shuffled
along
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
continuous
arguments
as
to
whether
he
should
lie
down
and
sleep
*NL*
at
some
near
spot
,
or
force
himself
on
until
he
reached
a
certain
*NL*
haven
.
He
often
tried
to
dismiss
the
question
,
but
his
body
persisted
*NL*
in
rebellion
and
his
senses
nagged
at
him
like
pampered
babies
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
heard
a
cheery
voice
near
his
shoulder
:
``
Yeh
seem
t
'
be
in
a
*NL*
pretty
bad
way
,
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
did
not
look
up
,
but
he
assented
with
thick
tongue
.
``
Uh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
owner
of
the
cheery
voice
took
him
firmly
by
the
arm
.
``
Well
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
with
a
round
laugh
,
``
I
'm
goin
'
your
way
.
Th
'
hull
gang
is
goin
'
*NL*
your
way
.
An
'
I
guess
I
kin
give
yeh
a
lift
.
''
They
began
to
walk
like
*NL*
a
drunken
man
and
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
along
,
the
man
questioned
the
youth
and
assisted
him
with
*NL*
the
replies
like
one
manipulating
the
mind
of
a
child
.
Sometimes
he
*NL*
interjected
anecdotes
.
``
What
reg
`
ment
do
yeh
b
`
long
teh
?
Eh
?
What
's
*NL*
that
?
Th
'
304th
N
'

?
Why
,
what
corps
is
that
in

Oh
,
it
is

Why

*NL*
I
thought
they
was
n't
engaged

they
're
`
way
over
in
th

center
.
*NL*
Oh
,
they
was

eh

Well
,
pretty
nearly
everybody
got
their
share

a
*NL*
fightin

t

By
dad
,
I
give
myself
up
fer
dead
any

a

times

There
was
shootin

an

shootin

an

hollerin

*NL*
an

darkness
,
until
I
could
n't
tell

Sometimes
I

I

an

other

It

Pretty
soon
,

we
'll
meet
a-plenty
of
*NL*
guards
an
'
provost-guards
,
an

one
thing
an

another
.
Ho

He

He

so
big
about
his
*NL*
reputation

all
when

Poor

How
did

Your

Well

I
*NL*
guess

can
find
it
.
Yeh
know
there
was
a
boy
killed
in
my
comp
`
ny
*NL*
t
'
-
day
that
I
thought
th

world
an
'
all

Jack

a
nice
feller
.
By
*NL*
ginger
,
it
hurt
like
thunder
t
'
see
ol'
Jack
jest

knocked
flat
.
We
*NL*
was
a-standin
'
purty
peaceable
fer
a
spell
,
`
though
there
was
men
*NL*
runnin

ev'ry
way
all
`
round
us
,
an
'
while
we
was
a-standin
'
like
that
,
*NL*
`
long
come
a
big
fat
feller
.
He
began
t
'
peck
at
Jack
's
elbow
,
an
'
he
*NL*
ses
:
`
Say
,
where
's
th
'
road
t
'
th

river
?
'
An
'
Jack
,
he
never
paid
no
*NL*
attention
,
an
'
th

feller
kept
on
a-peckin

at

:
*NL*
`
Say
,

'
Jack
was
a-lookin

ahead
all
*NL*
th
'
time
tryin
'
t
'
see
th
'
Johnnies
comin
'
through
th
'
woods
,
an
'
he
*NL*
never
paid
no
attention
t
'
this
big
fat
feller
fer
a
long
time
,
but
at
*NL*
last
he
turned
`
round
an
'
he
ses
:
`
Ah
,
go
t
'
hell
an
'
find
th
'
road
t
'
*NL*
th
'
river
!
'
An
'
jest
then
a
shot
slapped
him
bang
on
th
'
side
th
'
*NL*
head
.
He
was
a
sergeant
,
too
.
Them
was
his
last
words
.
Thunder
,
I
*NL*
wish
we
was
sure
'
a
findin

our
reg

It
's
goin

t
'
be
*NL*
long
huntin

.
But
I
guess
we
kin
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
search
which
followed
,
the
man
of
the
cheery
voice
seemed
to
the
*NL*
youth
to
possess
a
wand
of
a
magic
kind
.
He
threaded
the
mazes
of
the
*NL*
tangled
forest
with
a
strange
fortune
.
In
encounters
with
guards
and
*NL*
patrols
he
displayed
the
keenness
of
a
detective
and
the
valor
of
a
*NL*
gamin
.
Obstacles
fell
before
him
and
became
of
assistance
.
The
youth
,
*NL*
with
his
chin
still
on
his
breast
,
stood
woodenly
by
while
his
*NL*
companion
beat
ways
and
means
out
of
sullen
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
forest
seemed
a
vast
hive
of
men
buzzing
about
in
frantic
circles
,
*NL*
but
the
cheery
man
conducted
the
youth
without
mistakes
,
until
at
last
*NL*
he
began
to
chuckle
with
glee
and
self-satisfaction
.
``
Ah
,
there
yeh
*NL*
are
!
See
that
fire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
nodded
stupidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
's
where
your
reg
`
ment
is
.
An
'
now
,
good-by
,
ol'
boy
,
*NL*
good
luck
t
'
yeh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
warm
and
strong
hand
clasped
the
youth
's
languid
fingers
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
and
then
he
heard
a
cheerful
and
audacious
whistling
as
the
*NL*
man
strode
away
.
As
he
who
had
so
befriended
him
was
thus
passing
out
*NL*
of
his
life
,
it
suddenly
occurred
to
the
youth
that
he
had
not
once
*NL*
seen
his
face
.

CHAPTER
XIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
went
slowly
toward
the
fire
indicated
by
his
departed
friend
.
*NL*
As
he
reeled
,
he
bethought
him
of
the
welcome
his
comrades
would
give
*NL*
him
.
He
had
a
conviction
that
he
would
soon
feel
in
his
sore
heart
the
*NL*
barbed
missiles
of
ridicule
.
He
had
no
strength
to
invent
a
tale
;
he
*NL*
would
be
a
soft
target
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
vague
plans
to
go
off
into
the
deeper
darkness
and
hide
,
but
*NL*
they
were
all
destroyed
by
the
voices
of
exhaustion
and
pain
from
his
*NL*
body
.
His
ailments
,
clamoring
,
forced
him
to
seek
the
place
of
food
*NL*
and
rest
,
at
whatever
cost
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
swung
unsteadily
toward
the
fire
.
He
could
see
the
forms
of
men
*NL*
throwing
black
shadows
in
the
red
light
,
and
as
he
went
nearer
it
*NL*
became
known
to
him
in
some
way
that
the
ground
was
strewn
with
*NL*
sleeping
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
a
sudden
he
confronted
a
black
and
monstrous
figure
.
A
rifle
barrel
*NL*
caught
some
glinting
beams
.
``
Halt
!
halt
!
''
He
was
dismayed
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
but
he
presently
thought
that
he
recognized
the
nervous
voice
.
*NL*
As
he
stood
tottering
before
the
rifle
barrel
,
he
called
out
:
``
Why
,
*NL*
hello
,
Wilson
,
you
--
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rifle
was
lowered
to
a
position
of
caution
and
the
loud
soldier
*NL*
came
slowly
forward
.
He
peered
into
the
youth
's
face
.
``
That
you
,
*NL*
Henry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
--
it
's
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
ol'
boy
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
by
ginger
,
I
'm
glad
t
'
see
yeh
!
*NL*
I
give
yeh
up
fer
a
goner
.
I
thought
yeh
was
dead
sure
enough
.
''
There
*NL*
was
husky
emotion
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
found
that
now
he
could
barely
stand
upon
his
feet
.
There
*NL*
was
a
sudden
sinking
of
his
forces
.
He
thought
he
must
hasten
to
*NL*
produce
his
tale
to
protect
him
from
the
missiles
already
at
the
lips
*NL*
of
his
redoubtable
comrades
.
So
,
staggering
before
the
loud
soldier
,
he
*NL*
began
:
``
Yes
,
yes
.
I
've
--
I
've
had
an
awful
time
.
I
've
been
all
over
.
*NL*
Way
over
on
th
'
right
.
Ter
`
ble
fightin
'
over
there
.
I
had
an
awful
*NL*
time
.
I
got
separated
from
th
'
reg
`
ment
.
Over
on
th
'
right
,
I
got
*NL*
shot
.
In
th
'
head
.
I
never
see
sech
fightin
'
.
Awful
time
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
see
how
I
could
'
a
got
separated
from
th
'
reg
`
ment
.
I
got
shot
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
had
stepped
forward
quickly
.
``
What
?
Got
shot
?
Why
did
n't
*NL*
yeh
say
so
first
?
Poor
ol'
boy
,
we
must
--
hol
'
on
a
minnit
;
what
am
I
*NL*
doin
'
.
I
'll
call
Simpson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
figure
at
that
moment
loomed
in
the
gloom
.
They
could
see
that
*NL*
it
was
the
corporal
.
``
Who
yeh
talkin
'
to
,
Wilson
?
''
he
demanded
.
His
*NL*
voice
was
anger-toned
.
``
Who
yeh
talkin
'
to
?
Yeh
th
'
derndest
*NL*
sentinel
--
why
--
hello
,
Henry
,
you
here
?
Why
,
I
thought
you
was
dead
*NL*
four
hours
ago
!
Great
Jerusalem
,
they
keep
turnin
'
up
every
ten
*NL*
minutes
or
so
!
We
thought
we
'd
lost
forty-two
men
by
straight
count
,
*NL*
but
if
they
keep
on
a-comin
'
this
way
,
we
'll
git
th
'
comp
`
ny
all
back
*NL*
by
mornin
'
yit
.
Where
was
yeh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Over
on
th
'
right
.
I
got
separated
''
--
began
the
youth
with
*NL*
considerable
glibness
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
friend
had
interrupted
hastily
.
``
Yes
,
an
'
he
got
shot
in
th
'
*NL*
head
an
'
he
's
in
a
fix
,
an
'
we
must
see
t
'
him
right
away
.
''
He
rested
*NL*
his
rifle
in
the
hollow
of
his
left
arm
and
his
right
around
the
*NL*
youth
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gee
,
it
must
hurt
like
thunder
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
leaned
heavily
upon
his
friend
.
``
Yes
,
it
hurts
--
hurts
a
good
*NL*
deal
,
''
he
replied
.
There
was
a
faltering
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
the
corporal
.
He
linked
his
arm
in
the
youth
's
and
drew
him
*NL*
forward
.
``
Come
on
,
Henry
.
I
'll
take
keer
'
a
yeh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
on
together
the
loud
private
called
out
after
them
:
``
Put
*NL*
`
im
t
'
sleep
in
my
blanket
,
Simpson
.
An
'
--
hol
'
on
a
minnit
--
here
's
my
*NL*
canteen
.
It
's
full
'
a
coffee
.
Look
at
his
head
by
th
'
fire
an
'
see
*NL*
how
it
looks
.
Maybe
it
's
a
pretty
bad
un
.
When
I
git
relieved
in
a
*NL*
couple
'
a
minnits
,
I
'll
be
over
an
'
see
t
'
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
's
senses
were
so
deadened
that
his
friend
's
voice
sounded
*NL*
from
afar
and
he
could
scarcely
feel
the
pressure
of
the
corporal
's
*NL*
arm
.
He
submitted
passively
to
the
latter
's
directing
strength
.
His
*NL*
head
was
in
the
old
manner
hanging
forward
upon
his
breast
.
His
knees
*NL*
wobbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
led
him
into
the
glare
of
the
fire
.
``
Now
,
Henry
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
let
's
have
look
at
yer
ol'
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
sat
down
obediently
and
the
corporal
,
laying
aside
his
rifle
,
*NL*
began
to
fumble
in
the
bushy
hair
of
his
comrade
.
He
was
obliged
to
*NL*
turn
the
other
's
head
so
that
the
full
flush
of
the
fire
light
would
*NL*
beam
upon
it
.
He
puckered
his
mouth
with
a
critical
air
.
He
drew
back
*NL*
his
lips
and
whistled
through
his
teeth
when
his
fingers
came
in
*NL*
contact
with
the
splashed
blood
and
the
rare
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
here
we
are
!
''
he
said
.
He
awkwardly
made
further
investigations
.
*NL*
``
Jest
as
I
thought
,
''
he
added
,
presently
.
``
Yeh
've
been
grazed
by
a
*NL*
ball
.
It
's
raised
a
queer
lump
jest
as
if
some
feller
had
lammed
yeh
*NL*
on
th
'
head
with
a
club
.
It
stopped
a-bleedin
'
long
time
ago
.
Th
'
most
*NL*
about
it
is
that
in
th
'
mornin

yeh
'll
feel
that
a
number
ten
hat
*NL*
would
n't
fit

An

a
other

*NL*
Yeh
ca
n't
never
tell
.
Still
,
I
do
n't
much
think
so

It
's
jest
a

good

Then
I
'll
send
Wilson

*NL*
take

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
went
away
.
The
youth
remained
on
the
ground
like
a
*NL*
parcel
.
He
stared
with
a
vacant
look
into
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
he
aroused
,
for
some
part
,
and
the
things
about
him
began
*NL*
to
take
form
.
He
saw
that
the
ground
in
the
deep
shadows
was
cluttered
*NL*
with
men
,
sprawling
in
every
conceivable
posture
.
Glancing
narrowly
*NL*
into
the
more
distant
darkness
,
he
caught
occasional
glimpses
of
*NL*
visages
that
loomed
pallid
and
ghostly
,
lit
with
a
phosphorescent
glow
.
*NL*
These
faces
expressed
in
their
lines
the
deep
stupor
of
the
tired
*NL*
soldiers
.
They
made
them
appear
like
men
drunk
with
wine
.
This
bit
of
*NL*
forest
might
have
appeared
to
an
ethereal
wanderer
as
a
scene
of
the
*NL*
result
of
some
frightful
debauch
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
side
of
the
fire
the
youth
observed
an
officer
asleep
,
*NL*
seated
bolt
upright
,
with
his
back
against
a
tree
.
There
was
something
*NL*
perilous
in
his
position
.
Badgered
by
dreams
,
perhaps
,
he
swayed
with
*NL*
little
bounces
and
starts
,
like
an
old
toddy-stricken
grandfather
in
a
*NL*
chimney
corner
.
Dust
and
stains
were
upon
his
face
.
His
lower
jaw
*NL*
hung
down
as
if
lacking
strength
to
assume
its
normal
position
.
He
was
*NL*
the
picture
of
an
exhausted
soldier
after
a
feast
of
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
evidently
gone
to
sleep
with
his
sword
in
his
arms
.
These
two
*NL*
had
slumbered
in
an
embrace
,
but
the
weapon
had
been
allowed
in
time
to
*NL*
fall
unheeded
to
the
ground
.
The
brass-mounted
hilt
lay
in
contact
*NL*
with
some
parts
of
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
the
gleam
of
rose
and
orange
light
from
the
burning
sticks
were
*NL*
other
soldiers
,
snoring
and
heaving
,
or
lying
deathlike
in
slumber
.
A
*NL*
few
pairs
of
legs
were
stuck
forth
,
rigid
and
straight
.
The
shoes
*NL*
displayed
the
mud
or
dust
of
marches
and
bits
of
rounded
trousers
,
*NL*
protruding
from
the
blankets
,
showed
rents
and
tears
from
hurried
*NL*
pitchings
through
the
dense
brambles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fire
crackled
musically
.
From
it
swelled
light
smoke
.
Overhead
*NL*
the
foliage
moved
softly
.
The
leaves
,
with
their
faces
turned
toward
*NL*
the
blaze
,
were
colored
shifting
hues
of
silver
,
often
edged
with
red
.
*NL*
Far
off
to
the
right
,
through
a
window
in
the
forest
could
be
seen
a
*NL*
handful
of
stars
lying
,
like
glittering
pebbles
,
on
the
black
level
of
*NL*
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
,
in
this
low-arched
hall
,
a
soldier
would
arouse
and
turn
*NL*
his
body
to
a
new
position
,
the
experience
of
his
sleep
having
taught
*NL*
him
of
uneven
and
objectionable
places
upon
the
ground
under
him
.
Or
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
he
would
lift
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
,
blink
at
the
fire
*NL*
for
an
unintelligent
moment
,
throw
a
swift
glance
at
his
prostrate
*NL*
companion
,
and
then
cuddle
down
again
with
a
grunt
of
sleepy
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
sat
in
a
forlorn
heap
until
his
friend
the
loud
young
soldier
*NL*
came
,
swinging
two
canteens
by
their
light
strings
.
``
Well
,
now
,
Henry
,
*NL*
ol'
boy
,
''
said
the
latter
,
``
we
'll
have
yeh
fixed
up
in
jest
about
a
*NL*
minnit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
the
bustling
ways
of
an
amateur
nurse
.
He
fussed
around
the
*NL*
fire
and
stirred
the
sticks
to
brilliant
exertions
.
He
made
his
*NL*
patient
drink
largely
from
the
canteen
that
contained
the
coffee
.
It
*NL*
was
to
the
youth
a
delicious
draught
.
He
tilted
his
head
afar
back
and
*NL*
held
the
canteen
long
to
his
lips
.
The
cool
mixture
went
caressingly
*NL*
down
his
blistered
throat
.
Having
finished
,
he
sighed
with
comfortable
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
loud
young
soldier
watched
his
comrade
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
He
later
produced
an
extensive
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
.
He
folded
*NL*
it
into
a
manner
of
bandage
and
soused
water
from
the
other
canteen
*NL*
upon
the
middle
of
it
.
This
crude
arrangement
he
bound
over
the
*NL*
youth
's
head
,
tying
the
ends
in
a
queer
knot
at
the
back
of
the
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
he
said
,
moving
off
and
surveying
his
deed
,
``
yeh
look
like
th
'
*NL*
devil
,
but
I
bet
yeh
feel
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
contemplated
his
friend
with
grateful
eyes
.
Upon
his
aching
*NL*
and
swelling
head
the
cold
cloth
was
like
a
tender
woman
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yeh
do
n't
holler
ner
say
nothin
'
,
''
remarked
his
friend
approvingly
.
``
I
*NL*
know
I
'm
a
blacksmith
at
takin
'
keer
'
a
sick
folks

A

'
head

foolin

business

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
made
no
reply
,
but
began
to
fumble
with
the
buttons
of
his
*NL*
jacket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
come
,
now
,
''
continued
his
friend
,
``
come
on
.
I
must
put

t
'
*NL*
bed
an
'
see
that
yeh
git
a
good
night
's
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
got
carefully
erect
,
and
the
loud
young
soldier
led
him
among
*NL*
the
sleeping
forms
lying
in
groups
and
rows
.
Presently
he
stooped
and
*NL*
picked
up
his
blankets
.
He
spread
the
rubber
one
upon
the
ground
and
*NL*
placed
the
woolen
one
about
the
youth
's
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
''
he
said
,
``
lie
down
an
'
git
some
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
with
his
manner
of
doglike
obedience
,
got
carefully
down
*NL*
like
a
crone
stooping
.
He
stretched
out
with
a
murmur
of
relief
and
*NL*
comfort
.
The
ground
felt
like
the
softest
couch
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
of
a
sudden
he
ejaculated
:
``
Hol
'
on
a
minnit
!
Where
you
goin
'
t
'
*NL*
sleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
waved
his
hand
impatiently
.
``
Right
down
there
by
yeh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
hol
'
on
a
minnit

''
continued
the
youth
.
``
What
yeh
goin

t
'
*NL*
sleep

I
've
got

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
loud
young
soldier
snarled
:
``
Shet
up
an
'
go
on
t
'
sleep
.
Do
n't
be
*NL*
makin
'
a
damn
'
fool
'
a
yerself
,
''
he
said
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
reproof
the
youth
said
no
more
.
An
exquisite
drowsiness
had
*NL*
spread
through
him
.
The
warm
comfort
of
the
blanket
enveloped
him
and
*NL*
made
a
gentle
languor
.
His
head
fell
forward
on
his
crooked
arm
and
*NL*
his
weighted
lids
went
softly
down
over
his
eyes
.
Hearing
a
splatter
*NL*
of
musketry
from
the
distance
,
he
wondered
indifferently
if
those
men
*NL*
sometimes
slept
.
He
gave
a
long
sigh
,
snuggled
down
into
his
blanket
,
*NL*
and
in
a
moment
was
like
his
comrades
.

CHAPTER
XIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
youth
awoke
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
asleep
for
a
*NL*
thousand
years
,
and
he
felt
sure
that
he
opened
his
eyes
upon
an
*NL*
unexpected
world
.
Gray
mists
were
slowly
shifting
before
the
first
*NL*
efforts
of
the
sun
rays
.
An
impending
splendor
could
be
seen
in
the
*NL*
eastern
sky
.
An
icy
dew
had
chilled
his
face
,
and
immediately
upon
*NL*
arousing
he
curled
farther
down
into
his
blanket
.
He
stared
for
a
*NL*
while
at
the
leaves
overhead
,
moving
in
a
heraldic
wind
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
distance
was
splintering
and
blaring
with
the
noise
of
fighting
.
*NL*
There
was
in
the
sound
an
expression
of
a
deadly
persistency
,
as
if
it
*NL*
had
not
begun
and
was
not
to
cease
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
him
were
the
rows
and
groups
of
men
that
he
had
dimly
seen
the
*NL*
previous
night
.
They
were
getting
a
last
draught
of
sleep
before
the
*NL*
awakening
.
The
gaunt
,
careworn
features
and
dusty
figures
were
made
*NL*
plain
by
this
quaint
light
at
the
dawning
,
but
it
dressed
the
skin
of
*NL*
the
men
in
corpselike
hues
and
made
the
tangled
limbs
appear
pulseless
*NL*
and
dead
.
The
youth
started
up
with
a
little
cry
when
his
eyes
first
*NL*
swept
over
this
motionless
mass
of
men
,
thick-spread
upon
the
ground
,
*NL*
pallid
,
and
in
strange
postures
.
His
disordered
mind
interpreted
the
*NL*
hall
of
the
forest
as
a
charnel
place
.
He
believed
for
an
instant
that
*NL*
he
was
in
the
house
of
the
dead
,
and
he
did
not
dare
to
move
lest
these
*NL*
corpses
start
up
,
squalling
and
squawking
.
In
a
second
,
however
,
he
*NL*
achieved
his
proper
mind
.
He
swore
a
complicated
oath
at
himself
.
He
*NL*
saw
that
this
somber
picture
was
not
a
fact
of
the
present
,
but
a
mere
*NL*
prophecy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
then
the
noise
of
a
fire
crackling
briskly
in
the
cold
air
,
*NL*
and
,
turning
his
head
,
he
saw
his
friend
pottering
busily
about
a
small
*NL*
blaze
.
A
few
other
figures
moved
in
the
fog
,
and
he
heard
the
hard
*NL*
cracking
of
axe
blows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
there
was
a
hollow
rumble
of
drums
.
A
distant
bugle
sang
*NL*
faintly
.
Similar
sounds
,
varying
in
strength
,
came
from
near
and
far
*NL*
over
the
forest
.
The
bugles
called
to
each
other
like
brazen
*NL*
gamecocks
.
The
near
thunder
of
the
regimental
drums
rolled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
body
of
men
in
the
woods
rustled
.
There
was
a
general
uplifting
of
*NL*
heads
.
A
murmuring
of
voices
broke
upon
the
air
.
In
it
there
was
much
*NL*
bass
of
grumbling
oaths
.
Strange
gods
were
addressed
in
condemnation
*NL*
of
the
early
hours
necessary
to
correct
war
.
An
officer
's
peremptory
*NL*
tenor
rang
out
and
quickened
the
stiffened
movement
of
the
men
.
The
*NL*
tangled
limbs
unraveled
.
The
corpse-hued
faces
were
hidden
behind
*NL*
fists
that
twisted
slowly
in
the
eye
sockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
sat
up
and
gave
vent
to
an
enormous
yawn
.
``
Thunder
!
''
he
*NL*
remarked
petulantly
.
He
rubbed
his
eyes
,
and
then
putting
up
his
hand
*NL*
felt
carefully
of
the
bandage
over
his
wound
.
His
friend
,
perceiving
*NL*
him
to
be
awake
,
came
from
the
fire
.
``
Well
,
Henry
,
ol'
man
,
how
do
yeh
*NL*
feel
this
mornin
'
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
yawned
again
.
Then
he
puckered
his
mouth
to
a
little
pucker
.
*NL*
His
head
,
in
truth
,
felt
precisely
like
a
melon
,
and
there
was
an
*NL*
unpleasant
sensation
at
his
stomach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lord
,
I
feel
pretty
bad
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thunder
!
''
exclaimed
the
other
.
``
I
hoped
ye
'd
feel
all
right
this
*NL*
mornin
'
.
Let
's
see
th
'
bandage
--
I
guess
it
's
slipped
.
''
He
began
to
*NL*
tinker
at
the
wound
in
rather
a
clumsy
way
until
the
youth
exploded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gosh-dern
it
!
''
he
said
in
sharp
irritation
;
``
you
're
the
hangdest
man
I
*NL*
ever
saw
!
You
wear
muffs
on
your
hands
.
Why
in
good
thunderation
*NL*
ca
n't
you
be
more
easy
?
I
'd
rather
you
'd
stand
off
an
'
throw
guns
at
*NL*
it
.
Now
,
go
slow
,
an
'
do
n't
act
as
if
you
was
nailing
down
carpet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glared
with
insolent
command
at
his
friend
,
but
the
latter
answered
*NL*
soothingly
.
``
Well
,
well
,
come
now
,
an
'
git
some
grub
,
''
he
said
.
``
Then
,
*NL*
maybe
,
yeh
'll
feel
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
fireside
the
loud
young
soldier
watched
over
his
comrade
's
wants
*NL*
with
tenderness
and
care
.
He
was
very
busy
marshaling
the
little
black
*NL*
vagabonds
of
tin
cups
and
pouring
into
them
the
streaming
,
iron
colored
*NL*
mixture
from
a
small
and
sooty
tin
pail
.
He
had
some
fresh
meat
,
which
*NL*
he
roasted
hurriedly
upon
a
stick
.
He
sat
down
then
and
contemplated
*NL*
the
youth
's
appetite
with
glee
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
took
note
of
a
remarkable
change
in
his
comrade
since
those
*NL*
days
of
camp
life
upon
the
river
bank
.
He
seemed
no
more
to
be
*NL*
continually
regarding
the
proportions
of
his
personal
prowess
.
He
was
*NL*
not
furious
at
small
words
that
pricked
his
conceits
.
He
was
no
more
a
*NL*
loud
young
soldier
.
There
was
about
him
now
a
fine
reliance
.
He
*NL*
showed
a
quiet
belief
in
his
purposes
and
his
abilities
.
And
this
*NL*
inward
confidence
evidently
enabled
him
to
be
indifferent
to
little
*NL*
words
of
other
men
aimed
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
reflected
.
He
had
been
used
to
regarding
his
comrade
as
a
*NL*
blatant
child
with
an
audacity
grown
from
his
inexperience
,
*NL*
thoughtless
,
headstrong
,
jealous
,
and
filled
with
a
tinsel
courage
.
A
*NL*
swaggering
babe
accustomed
to
strut
in
his
own
dooryard
.
The
youth
*NL*
wondered
where
had
been
born
these
new
eyes
;
when
his
comrade
had
made
*NL*
the
great
discovery
that
there
were
many
men
who
would
refuse
to
be
*NL*
subjected
by
him
.
Apparently
,
the
other
had
now
climbed
a
peak
of
*NL*
wisdom
from
which
he
could
perceive
himself
as
a
very
wee
thing
.
And
*NL*
the
youth
saw
that
ever
after
it
would
be
easier
to
live
in
his
*NL*
friend
's
neighborhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
comrade
balanced
his
ebony
coffee-cup
on
his
knee
.
``
Well
,
Henry
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
what
d'yeh
think
th
'
chances
are
?
D'yeh
think
we
'll
wallop
*NL*
'em
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
considered
for
a
moment
.
``
Day-b
`
fore-yesterday
,
''
he
finally
*NL*
replied
,
with
boldness
,
``
you
would
`
a
'
bet
you
'd
lick
the
hull
*NL*
kit-an
'
-
boodle
all
by
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
looked
a
trifle
amazed
.
``
Would
I
?
''
he
asked
.
He
pondered
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
I
would
,
''
he
decided
at
last
.
He
stared
humbly
at
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
was
quite
disconcerted
at
this
surprising
reception
of
his
*NL*
remarks
.
``
Oh
,
no
,
you
would
n't
either
,
''
he
said
,
hastily
trying
to
*NL*
retrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
other
made
a
deprecating
gesture
.
``
Oh
,
yeh
need
n't
mind
,
*NL*
Henry
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
believe
I
was
a
pretty
big
fool
in
those
days
.
''
He
*NL*
spoke
as
after
a
lapse
of
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
th
'
officers
say
we
've
got
th
'
rebs
in
a
pretty
tight
box
,
''
said
*NL*
the
friend
,
clearing
his
throat
in
a
commonplace
way
.
``
They
all
seem
*NL*
t
'
think
we
've
got
'em
jest
where
we
want
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
''
the
youth
replied
.
``
What
I
seen
over
on
th
'
*NL*
right
makes
me
think
it
was
th
'
other
way
about
.
From
where
I
was
,
it
*NL*
looked
as
if
we
was
gettin
'
a
good
poundin
'
yestirday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'yeh
think
so
?
''
inquired
the
friend
.
``
I
thought
we
handled
'em
*NL*
pretty
rough
yestirday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
,
''
said
the
youth
.
``
Why
,
lord
,
man
,
you
did
n't
see
nothing
*NL*
of
the
fight
.
Why
!
''
Then
a
sudden
thought
came
to
him
.
``
Oh
!
Jim
*NL*
Conklin
's
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
started
.
``
What
?
Is
he
?
Jim
Conklin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
spoke
slowly
.
``
Yes
.
He
's
dead
.
Shot
in
th
'
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yeh
do
n't
say
so
.
Jim
Conklin
...
poor
cuss
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
about
them
were
other
small
fires
surrounded
by
men
with
their
*NL*
little
black
utensils
.
From
one
of
these
near
came
sudden
sharp
voices
*NL*
in
a
row
.
It
appeared
that
two
light-footed
soldiers
had
been
teasing
*NL*
a
huge
,
bearded
man
,
causing
him
to
spill
coffee
upon
his
blue
knees
.
*NL*
The
man
had
gone
into
a
rage
and
had
sworn
comprehensively
.
Stung
by
*NL*
his
language
,
his
tormentors
had
immediately
bristled
at
him
with
a
*NL*
great
show
of
resenting
unjust
oaths
.
Possibly
there
was
going
to
be
a
*NL*
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
friend
arose
and
went
over
to
them
,
making
pacific
motions
with
his
*NL*
arms
.
``
Oh
,
here
,
now
,
boys
,
what
's
th
'
use
?
''
he
said
.
``
We
'll
be
at
*NL*
th
'
rebs
in
less
'n
an
hour
.
What
's
th
'
good
fightin
'
`
mong
ourselves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
light-footed
soldiers
turned
upon
him
red-faced
and
violent
.
*NL*
``
Yeh
need
n't
come
around
here
with
yer
preachin
'
.
I
s
`
pose
yeh
do
n't
*NL*
approve
'
a
fightin
'
since
Charley
Morgan
licked
yeh
;
but
I
do
n't
see
*NL*
what
business
this
here
is
'
a
yours
or
anybody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
ai
n't
,
''
said
the
friend
mildly
.
``
Still
I
hate
t
'
see
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
tangled
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
--
,
''
said
the
two
,
indicating
their
opponent
with
accusative
*NL*
forefingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
huge
soldier
was
quite
purple
with
rage
.
He
pointed
at
the
two
*NL*
soldiers
with
his
great
hand
,
extended
clawlike
.
``
Well
,
they
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
during
this
argumentative
time
the
desire
to
deal
blows
seemed
to
*NL*
pass
,
although
they
said
much
to
each
other
.
Finally
the
friend
*NL*
returned
to
his
old
seat
.
In
a
short
while
the
three
antagonists
could
*NL*
be
seen
together
in
an
amiable
bunch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jimmie
Rogers
ses
I
'll
have
t
'
fight
him
after
th
'
battle
t
'
-
day
,
''
*NL*
announced
the
friend
as
he
again
seated
himself
.
``
He
ses
he
do
n't
*NL*
allow
no
interferin
'
in
his
business
.
I
hate
t
'
see

'
boys
fightin
'
*NL*
`
mong
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
laughed
.
``
Yer
changed
a
good
bit
.
Yeh
ai
n't
at
all
like
yeh
*NL*
was
.
I
remember
when
you
an
'
that
Irish
feller
--
''
He
stopped
and
*NL*
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
use
t
'
be
that
way
,
''
said
his
friend
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
``
That
's
true
`
nough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
n't
mean
--
''
began
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
friend
made
another
deprecatory
gesture
.
``
Oh
,
yeh
need
n't
mind
,
*NL*
Henry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
little
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Th
'
reg
`
ment
lost
over
half
th
'
men
yestirday

''
remarked
the
friend
*NL*
eventually
.
``

``

the

CHAPTER
XV
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
regiment
was
standing
at
order
arms
at
the
side
of
a
lane
,
waiting
*NL*
for
the
command
to
march
,
when
suddenly
the
youth
remembered
the
little
*NL*
packet
enwrapped
in
a
faded
yellow
envelope
which
the
loud
young
*NL*
soldier
with
lugubrious
words
had
intrusted
to
him
.
It
made
him
start
.
*NL*
He
uttered
an
exclamation
and
turned
toward
his
comrade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wilson
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
,
at
his
side
in
the
ranks
,
was
thoughtfully
staring
down
the
*NL*
road
.
From
some
cause
his
expression
was
at
that
moment
very
meek
.
The
*NL*
youth
,
regarding
him
with
sidelong
glances
,
felt
impelled
to
change
his
*NL*
purpose
.
``
Oh
,
nothing
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
turned
his
head
in
some
surprise
,
``
Why
,
what
was
yeh
goin
'
*NL*
t
'
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
,
''
repeated
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
resolved
not
to
deal
the
little
blow
.
It
was
sufficient
that
the
*NL*
fact
made
him
glad
.
It
was
not
necessary
to
knock
his
friend
on
the
*NL*
head
with
the
misguided
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
possessed
of
much
fear
of
his
friend
,
for
he
saw
how
easily
*NL*
questionings
could
make
holes
in
his
feelings
.
Lately
,
he
had
assured
*NL*
himself
that
the
altered
comrade
would
not
tantalize
him
with
a
*NL*
persistent
curiosity
,
but
he
felt
certain
that
during
the
first
period
*NL*
of
leisure
his
friend
would
ask
him
to
relate
his
adventures
of
the
*NL*
previous
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
rejoiced
in
the
possession
of
a
small
weapon
with
which
he
could
*NL*
prostrate
his
comrade
at
the
first
signs
of
a
cross-examination
.
He
*NL*
was
master
.
It
would
now
be
he
who
could
laugh
and
shoot
the
shafts
of
*NL*
derision
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
friend
had
,
in
a
weak
hour
,
spoken
with
sobs
of
his
own
death
.
He
*NL*
had
delivered
a
melancholy
oration
previous
to
his
funeral
,
and
had
*NL*
doubtless
in
the
packet
of
letters
,
presented
various
keepsakes
to
*NL*
relatives
.
But
he
had
not
died
,
and
thus
he
had
delivered
himself
into
*NL*
the
hands
of
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
felt
immensely
superior
to
his
friend
,
but
he
inclined
to
*NL*
condescension
.
He
adopted
toward
him
an
air
of
patronizing
good
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
self-pride
was
now
entirely
restored
.
In
the
shade
of
its
*NL*
flourishing
growth
he
stood
with
braced
and
self-confident
legs
,
and
*NL*
since
nothing
could
now
be
discovered
he
did
not
shrink
from
an
*NL*
encounter
with
the
eyes
of
judges
,
and
allowed
no
thoughts
of
his
own
*NL*
to
keep
him
from
an
attitude
of
manfulness
.
He
had
performed
his
*NL*
mistakes
in
the
dark
,
so
he
was
still
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
when
he
remembered
his
fortunes
of
yesterday
,
and
looked
at
*NL*
them
from
a
distance
he
began
to
see
something
fine
there
.
He
had
*NL*
license
to
be
pompous
and
veteranlike
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
panting
agonies
of
the
past
he
put
out
of
his
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
present
,
he
declared
to
himself
that
it
was
only
the
doomed
and
*NL*
the
damned
who
roared
with
sincerity
at
circumstance
.
Few
but
they
*NL*
ever
did
it
.
A
man
with
a
full
stomach
and
the
respect
of
his
fellows
*NL*
had
no
business
to
scold
about
anything
that
he
might
think
to
be
wrong
*NL*
in
the
ways
of
the
universe
,
or
even
with
the
ways
of
society
.
Let
the
*NL*
unfortunates
rail
;
the
others
may
play
marbles
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
give
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
these
battles
that
lay
*NL*
directly
before
him
.
It
was
not
essential
that
he
should
plan
his
ways
*NL*
in
regard
to
them
.
He
had
been
taught
that
many
obligations
of
a
life
*NL*
were
easily
avoided
.
The
lessons
of
yesterday
had
been
that
*NL*
retribution
was
a
laggard
and
blind
.
With
these
facts
before
him
he
*NL*
did
not
deem
it
necessary
that
he
should
become
feverish
over
the
*NL*
possibilities
of
the
ensuing
twenty-four
hours
.
He
could
leave
much
to
*NL*
chance
.
Besides
,
a
faith
in
himself
had
secretly
blossomed
.
There
was
*NL*
a
little
flower
of
confidence
growing
within
him
.
He
was
now
a
man
of
*NL*
experience
.
He
had
been
out
among
the
dragons
,
he
said
,
and
he
assured
*NL*
himself
that
they
were
not
so
hideous
as
he
had
imagined
them
.
Also
,
*NL*
they
were
inaccurate
;
they
did
not
sting
with
precision
.
A
stout
heart
*NL*
often
defied
,
and
defying
,
escaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
furthermore
,
how
could
they
kill
him
who
was
the
chosen
of
gods
*NL*
and
doomed
to
greatness
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
how
some
of
the
men
had
run
from
the
battle
.
As
he
*NL*
recalled
their
terror-struck
faces
he
felt
a
scorn
for
them
.
They
had
*NL*
surely
been
more
fleet
and
more
wild
than
was
absolutely
necessary
.
*NL*
They
were
weak
mortals
.
As
for
himself
,
he
had
fled
with
discretion
and
*NL*
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
aroused
from
this
reverie
by
his
friend
,
who
,
having
hitched
*NL*
about
nervously
and
blinked
at
the
trees
for
a
time
,
suddenly
coughed
*NL*
in
an
introductory
way
,
and
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fleming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
friend
put
his
hand
up
to
his
mouth
and
coughed
again
.
He
fidgeted
*NL*
in
his
jacket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
gulped
,
at
last
,
``
I
guess
yeh
might
as
well
give
me
back
*NL*
them
letters
.
''
Dark
,
prickling
blood
had
flushed
into
his
cheeks
and
*NL*
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
Wilson
,
''
said
the
youth
.
He
loosened
two
buttons
of
his
*NL*
coat
,
thrust
in
his
hand
,
and
brought
forth
the
packet
.
As
he
extended
*NL*
it
to
his
friend
the
latter
's
face
was
turned
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
slow
in
the
act
of
producing
the
packet
because
during
it
*NL*
he
had
been
trying
to
invent
a
remarkable
comment
upon
the
affair
.
He
*NL*
could
conjure
nothing
of
sufficient
point
.
He
was
compelled
to
allow
*NL*
his
friend
to
escape
unmolested
with
his
packet
.
And
for
this
he
took
*NL*
unto
himself
considerable
credit
.
It
was
a
generous
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
at
his
side
seemed
suffering
great
shame
.
As
he
*NL*
contemplated
him
,
the
youth
felt
his
heart
grow
more
strong
and
stout
.
*NL*
He
had
never
been
compelled
to
blush
in
such
manner
for
his
acts
;
he
*NL*
was
an
individual
of
extraordinary
virtues
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reflected
,
with
condescending
pity
:
``
Too
bad
!
Too
bad
!
The
poor
*NL*
devil
,
it
makes
him
feel
tough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
incident
,
and
as
he
reviewed
the
battle
pictures
he
had
*NL*
seen
,
he
felt
quite
competent
to
return
home
and
make
the
hearts
of
the
*NL*
people
glow
with
stories
of
war
.
He
could
see
himself
in
a
room
of
*NL*
warm
tints
telling
tales
to
listeners
.
He
could
exhibit
laurels
.
They
*NL*
were
insignificant
;
still
,
in
a
district
where
laurels
were
infrequent
,
*NL*
they
might
shine
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
his
gaping
audience
picturing
him
as
the
central
figure
in
*NL*
blazing
scenes
.
And
he
imagined
the
consternation
and
the
ejaculations
*NL*
of
his
mother
and
the
young
lady
at
the
seminary
as
they
drank
his
*NL*
recitals
.
Their
vague
feminine
formula
for
beloved
ones
doing
brave
*NL*
deeds
on
the
field
of
battle
without
risk
of
life
would
be
destroyed
.

CHAPTER
XVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sputtering
of
musketry
was
always
to
be
heard
.
Later
,
the
cannon
had
*NL*
entered
the
dispute
.
In
the
fog-filled
air
their
voices
made
a
*NL*
thudding
sound
.
The
reverberations
were
continued
.
This
part
of
the
*NL*
world
led
a
strange
,
battleful
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
's
regiment
was
marched
to
relieve
a
command
that
had
lain
*NL*
long
in
some
damp
trenches
.
The
men
took
positions
behind
a
curving
*NL*
line
of
rifle
pits
that
had
been
turned
up
,
like
a
large
furrow
,
along
*NL*
the
line
of
woods
.
Before
them
was
a
level
stretch
,
peopled
with
*NL*
short
,
deformed
stumps
.
From
the
woods
beyond
came
the
dull
popping
of
*NL*
the
skirmishers
and
pickets
,
firing
in
the
fog
.
From
the
right
came
*NL*
the
noise
of
a
terrific
fracas
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
cuddled
behind
the
small
embankment
and
sat
in
easy
attitudes
*NL*
awaiting
their
turn
.
Many
had
their
backs
to
the
firing
.
The
youth
's
*NL*
friend
lay
down
,
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
,
and
almost
instantly
,
it
*NL*
seemed
,
he
was
in
a
deep
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
leaned
his
breast
against
the
brown
dirt
and
peered
over
at
*NL*
the
woods
and
up
and
down
the
line
.
Curtains
of
trees
interfered
with
*NL*
his
ways
of
vision
.
He
could
see
the
low
line
of
trenches
but
for
a
*NL*
short
distance
.
A
few
idle
flags
were
perched
on
the
dirt
hills
.
*NL*
Behind
them
were
rows
of
dark
bodies
with
a
few
heads
sticking
*NL*
curiously
over
the
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
Always
the
noise
of
skirmishers
came
from
the
woods
on
the
front
and
*NL*
left
,
and
the
din
on
the
right
had
grown
to
frightful
proportions
.
The
*NL*
guns
were
roaring
without
an
instant
's
pause
for
breath
.
It
seemed
*NL*
that
the
cannon
had
come
from
all
parts
and
were
engaged
in
a
*NL*
stupendous
wrangle
.
It
became
impossible
to
make
a
sentence
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
wished
to
launch
a
joke
--
a
quotation
from
newspapers
.
He
*NL*
desired
to
say
,
``
All
quiet
on
the
Rappahannock
,
''
but
the
guns
refused
*NL*
to
permit
even
a
comment
upon
their
uproar
.
He
never
successfully
*NL*
concluded
the
sentence
.
But
at
last
the
guns
stopped
,
and
among
the
men
*NL*
in
the
rifle
pits
rumors
again
flew
,
like
birds
,
but
they
were
now
for
*NL*
the
most
part
black
creatures
who
flapped
their
wings
drearily
near
to
*NL*
the
ground
and
refused
to
rise
on
any
wings
of
hope
.
The
men
's
faces
*NL*
grew
doleful
from
the
interpreting
of
omens
.
Tales
of
hesitation
and
*NL*
uncertainty
on
the
part
of
those
high
in
place
and
responsibility
came
*NL*
to
their
ears
.
Stories
of
disaster
were
borne
into
their
minds
with
*NL*
many
proofs
.
This
din
of
musketry
on
the
right
,
growing
like
a
*NL*
released
genie
of
sound
,
expressed
and
emphasized
the
army
's
plight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
were
disheartened
and
began
to
mutter
.
They
made
gestures
*NL*
expressive
of
the
sentence
:
``
Ah
,
what
more
can
we
do
?
''
And
it
could
*NL*
always
be
seen
that
they
were
bewildered
by
the
alleged
news
and
could
*NL*
not
fully
comprehend
a
defeat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
gray
mists
had
been
totally
obliterated
by
the
sun
rays
,
the
*NL*
regiment
was
marching
in
a
spread
column
that
was
retiring
carefully
*NL*
through
the
woods
.
The
disordered
,
hurrying
lines
of
the
enemy
could
*NL*
sometimes
be
seen
down
through
the
groves
and
little
fields
.
They
were
*NL*
yelling
,
shrill
and
exultant
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
sight
the
youth
forgot
many
personal
matters
and
became
greatly
*NL*
enraged
.
He
exploded
in
loud
sentences
.
``
B'jiminey
,
we
're
generaled
*NL*
by
a
lot
'
a
lunkheads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
one
feller
has
said
that
t
'
-
day
,
''
observed
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
,
recently
aroused
,
was
still
very
drowsy
.
He
looked
behind
*NL*
him
until
his
mind
took
in
the
meaning
of
the
movement
.
Then
he
*NL*
sighed
.
``
Oh
,
well
,
I
s
`
pose
we
got
licked
,
''
he
remarked
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
had
a
thought
that
it
would
not
be
handsome
for
him
to
freely
*NL*
condemn
other
men
.
He
made
an
attempt
to
restrain
himself
,
but
the
*NL*
words
upon
his
tongue
were
too
bitter
.
He
presently
began
a
long
and
*NL*
intricate
denunciation
of
the
commander
of
the
forces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mebbe
,
it
wa
'n'
t
all
his
fault
--
not
all
together
.
He
did
th
'
best
he
*NL*
knowed
.
It
's
our
luck
t
'
git
licked
often
,
''
said
his
friend
in
a
weary
*NL*
tone
.
He
was
trudging
along
with
stooped
shoulders
and
shifting
eyes
*NL*
like
a
man
who
has
been
caned
and
kicked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
n't
we
fight
like
the
devil
?
Do
n't
we
do
all
that
men
can
?
''
*NL*
demanded
the
youth
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
secretly
dumfounded
at
this
sentiment
when
it
came
from
his
*NL*
lips
.
For
a
moment
his
face
lost
its
valor
and
he
looked
guiltily
*NL*
about
him
.
But
no
one
questioned
his
right
to
deal
in
such
words
,
and
*NL*
presently
he
recovered
his
air
of
courage
.
He
went
on
to
repeat
a
*NL*
statement
he
had
heard
going
from
group
to
group
at
the
camp
that
*NL*
morning
.
``
The
brigadier
said
he
never
saw
a
new
reg
`
ment
fight
the
way
*NL*
we
fought
yestirday
,
did
n't
he
?
And
we
did
n't
do
better
than
many
*NL*
another
reg
`
ment
,
did
we
?
Well
,
then
,
you
ca
n't
say
it
's
th
'
army
's
*NL*
fault
,
can
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
reply
,
the
friend
's
voice
was
stern
.
''
'
A
course
not
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
No
man
dare
say
we
do
n't
fight
like
th
'
devil
.
No
man
will
ever
dare
*NL*
say
it
.
Th
'
boys
fight
like
hell-roosters
.
But
still
--
still
,
we
do
n't
*NL*
have
no
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
if
we
fight
like
the
devil
an
'
do
n't
ever
whip
,
it
must
be
*NL*
the
general
's
fault
,
''
said
the
youth
grandly
and
decisively
.
``
And
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
any
sense
in
fighting
and
fighting
and
fighting
,
yet
always
*NL*
losing
through
some
derned
old
lunkhead
of
a
general
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sarcastic
man
who
was
tramping
at
the
youth
's
side
,
then
spoke
*NL*
lazily
.
``
Mebbe
yeh
think
yeh
fit
th
'
hull
battle
yestirday
,
Fleming
,
''
*NL*
he
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
speech
pierced
the
youth
.
Inwardly
he
was
reduced
to
an
abject
*NL*
pulp
by
these
chance
words
.
His
legs
quaked
privately
.
He
cast
a
*NL*
frightened
glance
at
the
sarcastic
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
''
he
hastened
to
say
in
a
conciliating
voice
,
``
I
do
n't
think
I
*NL*
fought
the
whole
battle
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
other
seemed
innocent
of
any
deeper
meaning
.
Apparently
,
he
*NL*
had
no
information
.
It
was
merely
his
habit
.
``
Oh
!
''
he
replied
in
the
*NL*
same
tone
of
calm
derision
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
nevertheless
,
felt
a
threat
.
His
mind
shrank
from
going
*NL*
near
to
the
danger
,
and
thereafter
he
was
silent
.
The
significance
of
*NL*
the
sarcastic
man
's
words
took
from
him
all
loud
moods
that
would
make
*NL*
him
appear
prominent
.
He
became
suddenly
a
modest
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
low-toned
talk
among
the
troops
.
The
officers
were
impatient
*NL*
and
snappy
,
their
countenances
clouded
with
the
tales
of
misfortune
.
*NL*
The
troops
,
sifting
through
the
forest
,
were
sullen
.
In
the
youth
's
*NL*
company
once
a
man
's
laugh
rang
out
.
A
dozen
soldiers
turned
their
*NL*
faces
quickly
toward
him
and
frowned
with
vague
displeasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
of
firing
dogged
their
footsteps
.
Sometimes
,
it
seemed
to
be
*NL*
driven
a
little
way
,
but
it
always
returned
again
with
increased
*NL*
insolence
.
The
men
muttered
and
cursed
,
throwing
black
looks
in
its
*NL*
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
clear
space
the
troops
were
at
last
halted
.
Regiments
and
*NL*
brigades
,
broken
and
detached
through
their
encounters
with
thickets
,
*NL*
grew
together
again
and
lines
were
faced
toward
the
pursuing
bark
of
*NL*
the
enemy
's
infantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
noise
,
following
like
the
yellings
of
eager
,
metallic
hounds
,
*NL*
increased
to
a
loud
and
joyous
burst
,
and
then
,
as
the
sun
went
*NL*
serenely
up
the
sky
,
throwing
illuminating
rays
into
the
gloomy
*NL*
thickets
,
it
broke
forth
into
prolonged
pealings
.
The
woods
began
to
*NL*
crackle
as
if
afire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whoop-a-dadee
,
''
said
a
man
,
``
here
we
are
!
Everybody
fightin
'
.
Blood
*NL*
an
'
destruction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
willin
'
t
'
bet
they
'd
attack
as
soon
as
th
'
sun
got
fairly
up
,
''
*NL*
savagely
asserted
the
lieutenant
who
commanded
the
youth
's
company
.
He
*NL*
jerked
without
mercy
at
his
little
mustache
.
He
strode
to
and
fro
with
*NL*
dark
dignity
in
the
rear
of
his
men
,
who
were
lying
down
behind
*NL*
whatever
protection
they
had
collected
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
battery
had
trundled
into
position
in
the
rear
and
was
thoughtfully
*NL*
shelling
the
distance
.
The
regiment
,
unmolested
as
yet
,
awaited
the
*NL*
moment
when
the
gray
shadows
of
the
woods
before
them
should
be
slashed
*NL*
by
the
lines
of
flame
.
There
was
much
growling
and
swearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Gawd
,
''
the
youth
grumbled
,
``
we
're
always
being
chased
around
like
*NL*
rats
!
It
makes
me
sick
.
Nobody
seems
to
know
where
we
go
or
why
we
*NL*
go
.
We
just
get
fired
around
from
pillar
to
post
and
get
licked
here
*NL*
and
get
licked
there
,
and
nobody
knows
what
it
's
done
for
.
It
makes
a
*NL*
man
feel
like
a
damn
'
kitten
in
a
bag
.
Now
,
I
'd
like
to
know
what
the
*NL*
eternal
thunders
we
was
marched
into
these
woods
for
anyhow
,
unless
it
*NL*
was
to
give
the
rebs
a
regular
pot
shot
at
us
.
We
came
in
here
and
got
*NL*
our
legs
all
tangled
up
in
these
cussed
briers
,
and
then
we
begin
to
*NL*
fight
and
the
rebs
had
an
easy
time
of
it
.
Do
n't
tell
me
it
's
just
*NL*
luck
!
I
know
better
.
It
's
this
derned
old
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
friend
seemed
jaded
,
but
he
interrupted
his
comrade
with
a
voice
of
*NL*
calm
confidence
.
``
It
'll
turn
out
all
right
in
th
'
end
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
devil
it
will
!
You
always
talk
like
a
dog-hanged
parson
.
*NL*
Do
n't
tell
me
!
I
know
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
there
was
an
interposition
by
the
savage-minded
*NL*
lieutenant
,
who
was
obliged
to
vent
some
of
his
inward
dissatisfaction
*NL*
upon
his
men
.
``
You
boys
shut
right
up
!
There
no
need

a
your
wastin

*NL*
your
breath
in
long-winded
arguments
about

You

been
jawin

like

a
old
hens

All
you

to

plenty

a

in
about
ten
minutes

Less

more

what
's
best
for
you
boys
.
I
never
saw
*NL*
sech
gabbling
jackasses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
ready
to
pounce
upon
any
man
who
might
have
the
temerity
to
*NL*
reply
.
No
words
being
said
,
he
resumed
his
dignified
pacing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
too
much
chin
music
an
'
too
little
fightin
'
in
this
war
,
*NL*
anyhow
,
''
he
said
to
them
,
turning
his
head
for
a
final
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
had
grown
more
white
,
until
the
sun
shed
his
full
radiance
upon
*NL*
the
thronged
forest
.
A
sort
of
a
gust
of
battle
came
sweeping
toward
*NL*
that
part
of
the
line
where
lay
the
youth
's
regiment
.
The
front
*NL*
shifted
a
trifle
to
meet
it
squarely
.
There
was
a
wait
.
In
this
part
*NL*
of
the
field
there
passed
slowly
the
intense
moments
that
precede
the
*NL*
tempest
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
single
rifle
flashed
in
a
thicket
before
the
regiment
.
In
an
instant
*NL*
it
was
joined
by
many
others
.
There
was
a
mighty
song
of
clashes
and
*NL*
crashes
that
went
sweeping
through
the
woods
.
The
guns
in
the
rear
,
*NL*
aroused
and
enraged
by
shells
that
had
been
thrown
burlike
at
them
,
*NL*
suddenly
involved
themselves
in
a
hideous
altercation
with
another
band
*NL*
of
guns
.
The
battle
roar
settled
to
a
rolling
thunder
,
which
was
a
*NL*
single
,
long
explosion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
regiment
there
was
a
peculiar
kind
of
hesitation
denoted
in
the
*NL*
attitudes
of
the
men
.
They
were
worn
,
exhausted
,
having
slept
but
*NL*
little
and
labored
much
.
They
rolled
their
eyes
toward
the
advancing
*NL*
battle
as
they
stood
awaiting
the
shock
.
Some
shrank
and
flinched
.
*NL*
They
stood
as
men
tied
to
stakes
.

CHAPTER
XVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
advance
of
the
enemy
had
seemed
to
the
youth
like
a
ruthless
*NL*
hunting
.
He
began
to
fume
with
rage
and
exasperation
.
He
beat
his
*NL*
foot
upon
the
ground
,
and
scowled
with
hate
at
the
swirling
smoke
that
*NL*
was
approaching
like
a
phantom
flood
.
There
was
a
maddening
quality
in
*NL*
this
seeming
resolution
of
the
foe
to
give
him
no
rest
,
to
give
him
no
*NL*
time
to
sit
down
and
think
.
Yesterday
he
had
fought
and
had
fled
*NL*
rapidly
.
There
had
been
many
adventures
.
For
to-day
he
felt
that
he
*NL*
had
earned
opportunities
for
contemplative
repose
.
He
could
have
*NL*
enjoyed
portraying
to
uninitiated
listeners
various
scenes
at
which
he
*NL*
had
been
a
witness
or
ably
discussing
the
processes
of
war
with
other
*NL*
proved
men
.
Too
it
was
important
that
he
should
have
time
for
physical
*NL*
recuperation
.
He
was
sore
and
stiff
from
his
experiences
.
He
had
*NL*
received
his
fill
of
all
exertions
,
and
he
wished
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
those
other
men
seemed
never
to
grow
weary
;
they
were
fighting
with
*NL*
their
old
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
wild
hate
for
the
relentless
foe
.
Yesterday
,
when
he
had
*NL*
imagined
the
universe
to
be
against
him
,
he
had
hated
it
,
little
gods
*NL*
and
big
gods
;
to-day
he
hated
the
army
of
the
foe
with
the
same
great
*NL*
hatred
.
He
was
not
going
to
be
badgered
of
his
life
,
like
a
kitten
*NL*
chased
by
boys
,
he
said
.
It
was
not
well
to
drive
men
into
final
*NL*
corners
;
at
those
moments
they
could
all
develop
teeth
and
claws
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
and
spoke
into
his
friend
's
ear
.
He
menaced
the
woods
with
a
*NL*
gesture
.
``
If
they
keep
on
chasing
us
,
by
Gawd
,
they
'd
better
watch
*NL*
out
.
Ca
n't
stand
TOO
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
friend
twisted
his
head
and
made
a
calm
reply
.
``
If
they
keep
on
*NL*
a-chasin
'
us
they
'll
drive
us
all
inteh
th
'
river
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
cried
out
savagely
at
this
statement
.
He
crouched
behind
a
*NL*
little
tree
,
with
his
eyes
burning
hatefully
and
his
teeth
set
in
a
*NL*
curlike
snarl
.
The
awkward
bandage
was
still
about
his
head
,
and
upon
*NL*
it
,
over
his
wound
,
there
was
a
spot
of
dry
blood
.
His
hair
was
*NL*
wondrously
tousled
,
and
some
straggling
,
moving
locks
hung
over
the
*NL*
cloth
of
the
bandage
down
toward
his
forehead
.
His
jacket
and
shirt
*NL*
were
open
at
the
throat
,
and
exposed
his
young
bronzed
neck
.
There
*NL*
could
be
seen
spasmodic
gulpings
at
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
fingers
twined
nervously
about
his
rifle
.
He
wished
that
it
was
an
*NL*
engine
of
annihilating
power
.
He
felt
that
he
and
his
companions
were
*NL*
being
taunted
and
derided
from
sincere
convictions
that
they
were
poor
*NL*
and
puny
.
His
knowledge
of
his
inability
to
take
vengeance
for
it
made
*NL*
his
rage
into
a
dark
and
stormy
specter
,
that
possessed
him
and
made
*NL*
him
dream
of
abominable
cruelties
.
The
tormentors
were
flies
sucking
*NL*
insolently
at
his
blood
,
and
he
thought
that
he
would
have
given
his
*NL*
life
for
a
revenge
of
seeing
their
faces
in
pitiful
plights
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
winds
of
battle
had
swept
all
about
the
regiment
,
until
the
one
*NL*
rifle
,
instantly
followed
by
others
,
flashed
in
its
front
.
A
moment
*NL*
later
the
regiment
roared
forth
its
sudden
and
valiant
retort
.
A
dense
*NL*
wall
of
smoke
settled
slowly
down
.
It
was
furiously
slit
and
slashed
by
*NL*
the
knifelike
fire
from
the
rifles
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
youth
the
fighters
resembled
animals
tossed
for
a
death
struggle
*NL*
into
a
dark
pit
.
There
was
a
sensation
that
he
and
his
fellows
,
at
*NL*
bay
,
were
pushing
back
,
always
pushing
fierce
onslaughts
of
creatures
*NL*
who
were
slippery
.
Their
beams
of
crimson
seemed
to
get
no
purchase
*NL*
upon
the
bodies
of
their
foes
;
the
latter
seemed
to
evade
them
with
*NL*
ease
,
and
come
through
,
between
,
around
,
and
about
with
unopposed
skill
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
in
a
dream
,
it
occurred
to
the
youth
that
his
rifle
was
an
*NL*
impotent
stick
,
he
lost
sense
of
everything
but
his
hate
,
his
desire
to
*NL*
smash
into
pulp
the
glittering
smile
of
victory
which
he
could
feel
*NL*
upon
the
faces
of
his
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blue
smoke-swallowed
line
curled
and
writhed
like
a
snake
stepped
*NL*
upon
.
It
swung
its
ends
to
and
fro
in
an
agony
of
fear
and
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
was
not
conscious
that
he
was
erect
upon
his
feet
.
He
did
*NL*
not
know
the
direction
of
the
ground
.
Indeed
,
once
he
even
lost
the
*NL*
habit
of
balance
and
fell
heavily
.
He
was
up
again
immediately
.
One
*NL*
thought
went
through
the
chaos
of
his
brain
at
the
time
.
He
wondered
*NL*
if
he
had
fallen
because
he
had
been
shot
.
But
the
suspicion
flew
away
*NL*
at
once
.
He
did
not
think
more
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
taken
up
a
first
position
behind
the
little
tree
,
with
a
direct
*NL*
determination
to
hold
it
against
the
world
.
He
had
not
deemed
it
*NL*
possible
that
his
army
could
that
day
succeed
,
and
from
this
he
felt
*NL*
the
ability
to
fight
harder
.
But
the
throng
had
surged
in
all
ways
,
*NL*
until
he
lost
directions
and
locations
,
save
that
he
knew
where
lay
the
*NL*
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flames
bit
him
,
and
the
hot
smoke
broiled
his
skin
.
His
rifle
*NL*
barrel
grew
so
hot
that
ordinarily
he
could
not
have
borne
it
upon
his
*NL*
palms
;
but
he
kept
on
stuffing
cartridges
into
it
,
and
pounding
them
*NL*
with
his
clanking
,
bending
ramrod
.
If
he
aimed
at
some
changing
form
*NL*
through
the
smoke
,
he
pulled
his
trigger
with
a
fierce
grunt
,
as
if
he
*NL*
were
dealing
a
blow
of
the
fist
with
all
his
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
enemy
seemed
falling
back
before
him
and
his
fellows
,
he
went
*NL*
instantly
forward
,
like
a
dog
who
,
seeing
his
foes
lagging
,
turns
and
*NL*
insists
upon
being
pursued
.
And
when
he
was
compelled
to
retire
again
,
*NL*
he
did
it
slowly
,
sullenly
,
taking
steps
of
wrathful
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
,
in
his
intent
hate
,
was
almost
alone
,
and
was
firing
,
when
all
*NL*
those
near
him
had
ceased
.
He
was
so
engrossed
in
his
occupation
that
*NL*
he
was
not
aware
of
a
lull
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
recalled
by
a
hoarse
laugh
and
a
sentence
that
came
to
his
ears
*NL*
in
a
voice
of
contempt
and
amazement
.
``
Yeh
infernal
fool
,
do
n't
yeh
*NL*
know
enough
t
'
quit
when
there
ai
n't
anything
t
'
shoot
at
?
Good
Gawd
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
then
and
,
pausing
with
his
rifle
thrown
half
into
position
,
*NL*
looked
at
the
blue
line
of
his
comrades
.
During
this
moment
of
leisure
*NL*
they
seemed
all
to
be
engaged
in
staring
with
astonishment
at
him
.
They
*NL*
had
become
spectators
.
Turning
to
the
front
again
he
saw
,
under
the
*NL*
lifted
smoke
,
a
deserted
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
bewildered
for
a
moment
.
Then
there
appeared
upon
the
glazed
*NL*
vacancy
of
his
eyes
a
diamond
point
of
intelligence
.
``
Oh
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
comprehending
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
his
comrades
and
threw
himself
upon
the
ground
.
He
*NL*
sprawled
like
a
man
who
had
been
thrashed
.
His
flesh
seemed
strangely
*NL*
on
fire
,
and
the
sounds
of
the
battle
continued
in
his
ears
.
He
groped
*NL*
blindly
for
his
canteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
was
crowing
.
He
seemed
drunk
with
fighting
.
He
called
*NL*
out
to
the
youth
:
``
By
heavens
,
if
I
had
ten
thousand
wild
cats
like
you
*NL*
I
could
tear
th
'
stomach
outa
this
war
in
less
'n
a
week
!
''
He
puffed
*NL*
out
his
chest
with
large
dignity
as
he
said
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
men
muttered
and
looked
at
the
youth
in
awe-struck
ways
.
It
*NL*
was
plain
that
as
he
had
gone
on
loading
and
firing
and
cursing
without
*NL*
the
proper
intermission
,
they
had
found
time
to
regard
him
.
And
they
*NL*
now
looked
upon
him
as
a
war
devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
friend
came
staggering
to
him
.
There
was
some
fright
and
dismay
in
*NL*
his
voice
.
``
Are
yeh
all
right
,
Fleming
?
Do
yeh
feel
all
right
?
There
*NL*
ai
n't
nothin
'
th
'
matter
with
yeh
,
Henry
,
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
youth
with
difficulty
.
His
throat
seemed
full
of
knobs
*NL*
and
burs
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
incidents
made
the
youth
ponder
.
It
was
revealed
to
him
that
he
*NL*
had
been
a
barbarian
,
a
beast
.
He
had
fought
like
a
pagan
who
defends
*NL*
his
religion
.
Regarding
it
,
he
saw
that
it
was
fine
,
wild
,
and
,
in
*NL*
some
ways
,
easy
.
He
had
been
a
tremendous
figure
,
no
doubt
.
By
this
*NL*
struggle
he
had
overcome
obstacles
which
he
had
admitted
to
be
*NL*
mountains
.
They
had
fallen
like
paper
peaks
,
and
he
was
now
what
he
*NL*
called
a
hero
.
And
he
had
not
been
aware
of
the
process
.
He
had
slept
*NL*
and
,
awakening
,
found
himself
a
knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
and
basked
in
the
occasional
stares
of
his
comrades
.
Their
*NL*
faces
were
varied
in
degrees
of
blackness
from
the
burned
powder
.
Some
*NL*
were
utterly
smudged
.
They
were
reeking
with
perspiration
,
and
their
*NL*
breaths
came
hard
and
wheezing
.
And
from
these
soiled
expanses
they
*NL*
peered
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hot
work
!
Hot
work
!
''
cried
the
lieutenant
deliriously
.
He
walked
up
*NL*
and
down
,
restless
and
eager
.
Sometimes
his
voice
could
be
heard
in
a
*NL*
wild
,
incomprehensible
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
a
particularly
profound
thought
upon
the
science
of
war
he
*NL*
always
unconsciously
addressed
himself
to
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
grim
rejoicing
by
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
thunder
,
I
bet
this
army
'll
never
see
another
new
reg
`
ment
like
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
forest
still
bore
its
burden
of
clamor
.
From
off
under
the
trees
*NL*
came
the
rolling
clatter
of
the
musketry
.
Each
distant
thicket
seemed
*NL*
a
strange
porcupine
with
quills
of
flame
.
A
cloud
of
dark
smoke
,
as
*NL*
from
smoldering
ruins
,
went
up
toward
the
sun
now
bright
and
gay
in
the
*NL*
blue
,
enameled
sky
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ragged
line
had
respite
for
some
minutes
,
but
during
its
pause
the
*NL*
struggle
in
the
forest
became
magnified
until
the
trees
seemed
to
*NL*
quiver
from
the
firing
and
the
ground
to
shake
from
the
rushing
of
the
*NL*
men
.
The
voices
of
the
cannon
were
mingled
in
a
long
and
interminable
*NL*
row
.
It
seemed
difficult
to
live
in
such
an
atmosphere
.
The
chests
of
*NL*
the
men
strained
for
a
bit
of
freshness
,
and
their
throats
craved
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
shot
through
the
body
,
who
raised
a
cry
of
bitter
*NL*
lamentation
when
came
this
lull
.
Perhaps
he
had
been
calling
out
*NL*
during
the
fighting
also
,
but
at
that
time
no
one
had
heard
him
.
But
*NL*
now
the
men
turned
at
the
woeful
complaints
of
him
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
?
Who
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Jimmie
Rogers
.
Jimmie
Rogers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
their
eyes
first
encountered
him
there
was
a
sudden
halt
,
as
if
*NL*
they
feared
to
go
near
.
He
was
thrashing
about
in
the
grass
,
twisting
*NL*
his
shuddering
body
into
many
strange
postures
.
He
was
screaming
*NL*
loudly
.
This
instant
's
hesitation
seemed
to
fill
him
with
a
*NL*
tremendous
,
fantastic
contempt
,
and
he
damned
them
in
shrieked
*NL*
sentences
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
's
friend
had
a
geographical
illusion
concerning
a
stream
,
and
*NL*
he
obtained
permission
to
go
for
some
water
.
Immediately
canteens
were
*NL*
showered
upon
him
.
``
Fill
mine
,
will
yeh
?
''
``
Bring
me
some
,
too
.
''
``
And
*NL*
me
,
too
.
''
He
departed
,
ladened
.
The
youth
went
with
his
friend
,
*NL*
feeling
a
desire
to
throw
his
heated
body
onto
the
stream
and
,
soaking
*NL*
there
,
drink
quarts
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
a
hurried
search
for
the
supposed
stream
,
but
did
not
find
*NL*
it
.
``
No
water
here
,
''
said
the
youth
.
They
turned
without
delay
and
*NL*
began
to
retrace
their
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
their
position
as
they
again
faced
toward
the
place
of
the
*NL*
fighting
,
they
could
of
course
comprehend
a
greater
amount
of
the
*NL*
battle
than
when
their
visions
had
been
blurred
by
the
hurling
smoke
of
*NL*
the
line
.
They
could
see
dark
stretches
winding
along
the
land
,
and
on
*NL*
one
cleared
space
there
was
a
row
of
guns
making
gray
clouds
,
which
*NL*
were
filled
with
large
flashes
of
orange-colored
flame
.
Over
some
*NL*
foliage
they
could
see
the
roof
of
a
house
.
One
window
,
glowing
a
deep
*NL*
murder
red
,
shone
squarely
through
the
leaves
.
From
the
edifice
a
tall
*NL*
leaning
tower
of
smoke
went
far
into
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
over
their
own
troops
,
they
saw
mixed
masses
slowly
getting
*NL*
into
regular
form
.
The
sunlight
made
twinkling
points
of
the
bright
*NL*
steel
.
To
the
rear
there
was
a
glimpse
of
a
distant
roadway
as
it
*NL*
curved
over
a
slope
.
It
was
crowded
with
retreating
infantry
.
From
*NL*
all
the
interwoven
forest
arose
the
smoke
and
bluster
of
the
battle
.
*NL*
The
air
was
always
occupied
by
a
blaring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
where
they
stood
shells
were
flip-flapping
and
hooting
.
Occasional
*NL*
bullets
buzzed
in
the
air
and
spanged
into
tree
trunks
.
Wounded
men
and
*NL*
other
stragglers
were
slinking
through
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
down
an
aisle
of
the
grove
,
the
youth
and
his
companion
saw
a
*NL*
jangling
general
and
his
staff
almost
ride
upon
a
wounded
man
,
who
was
*NL*
crawling
on
his
hands
and
knees
.
The
general
reined
strongly
at
his
*NL*
charger
's
opened
and
foamy
mouth
and
guided
it
with
dexterous
*NL*
horsemanship
past
the
man
.
The
latter
scrambled
in
wild
and
torturing
*NL*
haste
.
His
strength
evidently
failed
him
as
he
reached
a
place
of
*NL*
safety
.
One
of
his
arms
suddenly
weakened
,
and
he
fell
,
sliding
over
*NL*
upon
his
back
.
He
lay
stretched
out
,
breathing
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
the
small
,
creaking
cavalcade
was
directly
in
front
of
*NL*
the
two
soldiers
.
Another
officer
,
riding
with
the
skillful
abandon
of
*NL*
a
cowboy
,
galloped
his
horse
to
a
position
directly
before
the
general
.
*NL*
The
two
unnoticed
foot
soldiers
made
a
little
show
of
going
on
,
but
*NL*
they
lingered
near
in
the
desire
to
overhear
the
conversation
.
Perhaps
,
*NL*
they
thought
,
some
great
inner
historical
things
would
be
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
,
whom
the
boys
knew
as
the
commander
of
their
division
,
*NL*
looked
at
the
other
officer
and
spoke
coolly
,
as
if
he
were
criticising
*NL*
his
clothes
.
``
Th
'
enemy
's
formin
'
over
there
for
another
charge
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
It
'll
be
directed
against
Whiterside
,
an
'
I
fear
they
'll
break
*NL*
through
there
unless
we
work
like
thunder
t
'
stop
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
swore
at
his
restive
horse
,
and
then
cleared
his
throat
.
He
*NL*
made
a
gesture
toward
his
cap
.
``
It
'll
be
hell
t
'
pay
stoppin
'
them
,
''
*NL*
he
said
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
presume
so
,
''
remarked
the
general
.
Then
he
began
to
talk
rapidly
*NL*
and
in
a
lower
tone
.
He
frequently
illustrated
his
words
with
a
*NL*
pointing
finger
.
The
two
infantrymen
could
hear
nothing
until
finally
*NL*
he
asked
:
``
What
troops
can
you
spare
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
who
rode
like
a
cowboy
reflected
for
an
instant
.
``
Well
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
I
had
to
order
in
th
'
12th
to
help
th
'
76th
,
an
'
I
have
n't
*NL*
really
got
any
.
But
there
's
th
'
304th
.
They
fight
like
a
lot
'
a
mule
*NL*
drivers
.
I
can
spare
them
best
of
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
and
his
friend
exchanged
glances
of
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
spoke
sharply
.
``
Get
'em
ready
,
then
.
I
'll
watch
*NL*
developments
from
here
,
an
'
send
you
word
when
t
'
start
them
.
It
'll
*NL*
happen
in
five
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
other
officer
tossed
his
fingers
toward
his
cap
and
wheeling
his
*NL*
horse
,
started
away
,
the
general
called
out
to
him
in
a
sober
voice
:
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
many
of
your
mule
drivers
will
get
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
shouted
something
in
reply
.
He
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
scared
faces
,
the
youth
and
his
companion
hurried
back
to
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
happenings
had
occupied
an
incredibly
short
time
,
yet
the
youth
*NL*
felt
that
in
them
he
had
been
made
aged
.
New
eyes
were
given
to
him
.
*NL*
And
the
most
startling
thing
was
to
learn
suddenly
that
he
was
very
*NL*
insignificant
.
The
officer
spoke
of
the
regiment
as
if
he
referred
to
*NL*
a
broom
.
Some
part
of
the
woods
needed
sweeping
,
perhaps
,
and
he
*NL*
merely
indicated
a
broom
in
a
tone
properly
indifferent
to
its
fate
.
It
*NL*
was
war
,
no
doubt
,
but
it
appeared
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
two
boys
approached
the
line
,
the
lieutenant
perceived
them
and
*NL*
swelled
with
wrath
.
``
Fleming
--
Wilson
--
how
long
does
it
take
yeh
to
git
*NL*
water
,
anyhow
--
where
yeh
been
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
oration
ceased
as
he
saw
their
eyes
,
which
were
large
with
*NL*
great
tales
.
``
We
're
goin
'
t
'
charge
--
we
're
goin
'
t
'
charge
!
''
cried
the
*NL*
youth
's
friend
,
hastening
with
his
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charge
?
''
said
the
lieutenant
.
``
Charge
?
Well
,
b
`
Gawd
!
Now
,
this
is
*NL*
real
fightin
'
.
''
Over
his
soiled
countenance
there
went
a
boastful
*NL*
smile
.
``
Charge
?
Well
,
b
`
Gawd
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
group
of
soldiers
surrounded
the
two
youths
.
``
Are
we
,
sure
*NL*
`
nough
?
Well
,
I
'll
be
derned
!
Charge
?
What
fer
?
What
at
?
Wilson
,
*NL*
you
're
lyin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
to
die
,
''
said
the
youth
,
pitching
his
tones
to
the
key
of
angry
*NL*
remonstrance
.
``
Sure
as
shooting
,
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
his
friend
spoke
in
re-enforcement
.
``
Not
by
a
blame
sight
,
he
*NL*
ai
n't
lyin
'
.
We
heard
'em
talkin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
caught
sight
of
two
mounted
figures
a
short
distance
from
them
.
*NL*
One
was
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
and
the
other
was
the
officer
who
*NL*
had
received
orders
from
the
commander
of
the
division
.
They
were
*NL*
gesticulating
at
each
other
.
The
soldier
,
pointing
at
them
,
interpreted
*NL*
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
man
had
a
final
objection
:
``
How
could
yeh
hear
'em
talkin
'
?
''
But
*NL*
the
men
,
for
a
large
part
,
nodded
,
admitting
that
previously
the
two
*NL*
friends
had
spoken
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
settled
back
into
reposeful
attitudes
with
airs
of
having
accepted
*NL*
the
matter
.
And
they
mused
upon
it
,
with
a
hundred
varieties
of
*NL*
expression
.
It
was
an
engrossing
thing
to
think
about
.
Many
tightened
*NL*
their
belts
carefully
and
hitched
at
their
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
the
officers
began
to
bustle
among
the
men
,
pushing
them
*NL*
into
a
more
compact
mass
and
into
a
better
alignment
.
They
chased
*NL*
those
that
straggled
and
fumed
at
a
few
men
who
seemed
to
show
by
their
*NL*
attitudes
that
they
had
decided
to
remain
at
that
spot
.
They
were
like
*NL*
critical
shepherds
struggling
with
sheep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
the
regiment
seemed
to
draw
itself
up
and
heave
a
deep
*NL*
breath
.
None
of
the
men
's
faces
were
mirrors
of
large
thoughts
.
The
*NL*
soldiers
were
bended
and
stooped
like
sprinters
before
a
signal
.
Many
*NL*
pairs
of
glinting
eyes
peered
from
the
grimy
faces
toward
the
curtains
*NL*
of
the
deeper
woods
.
They
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
deep
calculations
of
*NL*
time
and
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
surrounded
by
the
noises
of
the
monstrous
altercation
between
*NL*
the
two
armies
.
The
world
was
fully
interested
in
other
matters
.
*NL*
Apparently
,
the
regiment
had
its
small
affair
to
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
turning
,
shot
a
quick
,
inquiring
glance
at
his
friend
.
The
*NL*
latter
returned
to
him
the
same
manner
of
look
.
They
were
the
only
*NL*
ones
who
possessed
an
inner
knowledge
.
``
Mule
drivers
--
hell
t
'
*NL*
pay
--
do
n't
believe
many
will
get
back
.
''
It
was
an
ironical
secret
.
*NL*
Still
,
they
saw
no
hesitation
in
each
other
's
faces
,
and
they
nodded
a
*NL*
mute
and
unprotesting
assent
when
a
shaggy
man
near
them
said
in
a
meek
*NL*
voice
:
``
We
'll
git
swallowed
.

CHAPTER
XIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
stared
at
the
land
in
front
of
him
.
Its
foliages
now
seemed
*NL*
to
veil
powers
and
horrors
.
He
was
unaware
of
the
machinery
of
orders
*NL*
that
started
the
charge
,
although
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
he
saw
*NL*
an
officer
,
who
looked
like
a
boy
a-horseback
,
come
galloping
,
waving
*NL*
his
hat
.
Suddenly
he
felt
a
straining
and
heaving
among
the
men
.
The
*NL*
line
fell
slowly
forward
like
a
toppling
wall
,
and
,
with
a
convulsive
*NL*
gasp
that
was
intended
for
a
cheer
,
the
regiment
began
its
journey
.
The
*NL*
youth
was
pushed
and
jostled
for
a
moment
before
he
understood
the
*NL*
movement
at
all
,
but
directly
he
lunged
ahead
and
began
to
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fixed
his
eye
upon
a
distant
and
prominent
clump
of
trees
where
he
*NL*
had
concluded
the
enemy
were
to
be
met
,
and
he
ran
toward
it
as
toward
*NL*
a
goal
.
He
had
believed
throughout
that
it
was
a
mere
question
of
*NL*
getting
over
an
unpleasant
matter
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
he
ran
*NL*
desperately
,
as
if
pursued
for
a
murder
.
His
face
was
drawn
hard
and
*NL*
tight
with
the
stress
of
his
endeavor
.
His
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
lurid
*NL*
glare
.
And
with
his
soiled
and
disordered
dress
,
his
red
and
inflamed
*NL*
features
surmounted
by
the
dingy
rag
with
its
spot
of
blood
,
his
wildly
*NL*
swinging
rifle
and
banging
accouterments
,
he
looked
to
be
an
insane
*NL*
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
regiment
swung
from
its
position
out
into
a
cleared
space
the
*NL*
woods
and
thickets
before
it
awakened
.
Yellow
flames
leaped
toward
it
*NL*
from
many
directions
.
The
forest
made
a
tremendous
objection
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
line
lurched
straight
for
a
moment
.
Then
the
right
wing
swung
*NL*
forward
;
it
in
turn
was
surpassed
by
the
left
.
Afterward
the
center
*NL*
careered
to
the
front
until
the
regiment
was
a
wedge-shaped
mass
,
but
*NL*
an
instant
later
the
opposition
of
the
bushes
,
trees
,
and
uneven
places
*NL*
on
the
ground
split
the
command
and
scattered
it
into
detached
clusters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
light-footed
,
was
unconsciously
in
advance
.
His
eyes
still
*NL*
kept
note
of
the
clump
of
trees
.
From
all
places
near
it
the
clannish
*NL*
yell
of
the
enemy
could
be
heard
.
The
little
flames
of
rifles
leaped
*NL*
from
it
.
The
song
of
the
bullets
was
in
the
air
and
shells
snarled
*NL*
among
the
tree-tops
.
One
tumbled
directly
into
the
middle
of
a
*NL*
hurrying
group
and
exploded
in
crimson
fury
.
There
was
an
instant
's
*NL*
spectacle
of
a
man
,
almost
over
it
,
throwing
up
his
hands
to
shield
his
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
men
,
punched
by
bullets
,
fell
in
grotesque
agonies
.
The
regiment
*NL*
left
a
coherent
trail
of
bodies
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
passed
into
a
clearer
atmosphere
.
There
was
an
effect
like
a
*NL*
revelation
in
the
new
appearance
of
the
landscape
.
Some
men
working
*NL*
madly
at
a
battery
were
plain
to
them
,
and
the
opposing
infantry
's
*NL*
lines
were
defined
by
the
gray
walls
and
fringes
of
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
the
youth
that
he
saw
everything
.
Each
blade
of
the
green
*NL*
grass
was
bold
and
clear
.
He
thought
that
he
was
aware
of
every
change
*NL*
in
the
thin
,
transparent
vapor
that
floated
idly
in
sheets
.
The
brown
*NL*
or
gray
trunks
of
the
trees
showed
each
roughness
of
their
surfaces
.
*NL*
And
the
men
of
the
regiment
,
with
their
starting
eyes
and
sweating
*NL*
faces
,
running
madly
,
or
falling
,
as
if
thrown
headlong
,
to
queer
,
*NL*
heaped-up
corpses
--
all
were
comprehended
.
His
mind
took
a
mechanical
*NL*
but
firm
impression
,
so
that
afterward
everything
was
pictured
and
*NL*
explained
to
him
,
save
why
he
himself
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
a
frenzy
made
from
this
furious
rush
.
The
men
,
pitching
*NL*
forward
insanely
,
had
burst
into
cheerings
,
moblike
and
barbaric
,
but
*NL*
tuned
in
strange
keys
that
can
arouse
the
dullard
and
the
stoic
.
It
*NL*
made
a
mad
enthusiasm
that
,
it
seemed
,
would
be
incapable
of
checking
*NL*
itself
before
granite
and
brass
.
There
was
the
delirium
that
*NL*
encounters
despair
and
death
,
and
is
heedless
and
blind
to
the
odds
.
It
*NL*
is
a
temporary
but
sublime
absence
of
selfishness
.
And
because
it
was
*NL*
of
this
order
was
the
reason
,
perhaps
,
why
the
youth
wondered
,
*NL*
afterward
,
what
reasons
he
could
have
had
for
being
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
straining
pace
ate
up
the
energies
of
the
men
.
As
if
by
*NL*
agreement
,
the
leaders
began
to
slacken
their
speed
.
The
volleys
*NL*
directed
against
them
had
had
a
seeming
windlike
effect
.
The
regiment
*NL*
snorted
and
blew
.
Among
some
stolid
trees
it
began
to
falter
and
*NL*
hesitate
.
The
men
,
staring
intently
,
began
to
wait
for
some
of
the
*NL*
distant
walls
of
smoke
to
move
and
disclose
to
them
the
scene
.
Since
*NL*
much
of
their
strength
and
their
breath
had
vanished
,
they
returned
to
*NL*
caution
.
They
were
become
men
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
had
a
vague
belief
that
he
had
run
miles
,
and
he
thought
,
in
*NL*
a
way
,
that
he
was
now
in
some
new
and
unknown
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
the
regiment
ceased
its
advance
the
protesting
splutter
of
*NL*
musketry
became
a
steadied
roar
.
Long
and
accurate
fringes
of
smoke
*NL*
spread
out
.
From
the
top
of
a
small
hill
came
level
belchings
of
*NL*
yellow
flame
that
caused
an
inhuman
whistling
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
,
halted
,
had
opportunity
to
see
some
of
their
comrades
dropping
*NL*
with
moans
and
shrieks
.
A
few
lay
under
foot
,
still
or
wailing
.
And
*NL*
now
for
an
instant
the
men
stood
,
their
rifles
slack
in
their
hands
,
*NL*
and
watched
the
regiment
dwindle
.
They
appeared
dazed
and
stupid
.
This
*NL*
spectacle
seemed
to
paralyze
them
,
overcome
them
with
a
fatal
*NL*
fascination
.
They
stared
woodenly
at
the
sights
,
and
,
lowering
their
*NL*
eyes
,
looked
from
face
to
face
.
It
was
a
strange
pause
,
and
a
strange
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
above
the
sounds
of
the
outside
commotion
,
arose
the
roar
of
the
*NL*
lieutenant
.
He
strode
suddenly
forth
,
his
infantile
features
black
*NL*
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
yeh
fools
!
''
he
bellowed
.
``
Come
on
!
Yeh
ca
n't
stay
here
.
Yeh
*NL*
must
come
on
.
''
He
said
more
,
but
much
of
it
could
not
be
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
rapidly
forward
,
with
his
head
turned
toward
the
men
.
``
Come
*NL*
on
,
''
he
was
shouting
.
The
men
stared
with
blank
and
yokel-like
eyes
at
*NL*
him
.
He
was
obliged
to
halt
and
retrace
his
steps
.
He
stood
then
with
*NL*
his
back
to
the
enemy
and
delivered
gigantic
curses
into
the
faces
of
*NL*
the
men
.
His
body
vibrated
from
the
weight
and
force
of
his
*NL*
imprecations
.
And
he
could
string
oaths
with
the
facility
of
a
maiden
*NL*
who
strings
beads
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
friend
of
the
youth
aroused
.
Lurching
suddenly
forward
and
*NL*
dropping
to
his
knees
,
he
fired
an
angry
shot
at
the
persistent
woods
.
*NL*
This
action
awakened
the
men
.
They
huddled
no
more
like
sheep
.
They
*NL*
seemed
suddenly
to
bethink
them
of
their
weapons
,
and
at
once
commenced
*NL*
firing
.
Belabored
by
their
officers
,
they
began
to
move
forward
.
The
*NL*
regiment
,
involved
like
a
cart
involved
in
mud
and
muddle
,
started
*NL*
unevenly
with
many
jolts
and
jerks
.
The
men
stopped
now
every
few
*NL*
paces
to
fire
and
load
,
and
in
this
manner
moved
slowly
on
from
trees
*NL*
to
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flaming
opposition
in
their
front
grew
with
their
advance
until
it
*NL*
seemed
that
all
forward
ways
were
barred
by
the
thin
leaping
tongues
,
*NL*
and
off
to
the
right
an
ominous
demonstration
could
sometimes
be
dimly
*NL*
discerned
.
The
smoke
lately
generated
was
in
confusing
clouds
that
made
*NL*
it
difficult
for
the
regiment
to
proceed
with
intelligence
.
As
he
*NL*
passed
through
each
curling
mass
the
youth
wondered
what
would
confront
*NL*
him
on
the
farther
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
command
went
painfully
forward
until
an
open
space
interposed
*NL*
between
them
and
the
lurid
lines
.
Here
,
crouching
and
cowering
behind
*NL*
some
trees
,
the
men
clung
with
desperation
,
as
if
threatened
by
a
wave
.
*NL*
They
looked
wild-eyed
,
and
as
if
amazed
at
this
furious
disturbance
*NL*
they
had
stirred
.
In
the
storm
there
was
an
ironical
expression
of
*NL*
their
importance
.
The
faces
of
the
men
,
too
,
showed
a
lack
of
a
*NL*
certain
feeling
of
responsibility
for
being
there
.
It
was
as
if
they
*NL*
had
been
driven
.
It
was
the
dominant
animal
failing
to
remember
in
the
*NL*
supreme
moments
the
forceful
causes
of
various
superficial
qualities
.
*NL*
The
whole
affair
seemed
incomprehensible
to
many
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
halted
thus
the
lieutenant
again
began
to
bellow
profanely
.
*NL*
Regardless
of
the
vindictive
threats
of
the
bullets
,
he
went
about
*NL*
coaxing
,
berating
,
and
bedamning
.
His
lips
,
that
were
habitually
in
a
*NL*
soft
and
childlike
curve
,
were
now
writhed
into
unholy
contortions
.
He
*NL*
swore
by
all
possible
deities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
grabbed
the
youth
by
the
arm
.
``
Come
on
,
yeh
lunkhead
!
''
he
*NL*
roared
.
``
Come
on
!
We
'll
all
git
killed
if
we
stay
here
.
We
've
on
'
y
*NL*
got
t
'
go
across
that
lot
.
An
'
then
''
--
the
remainder
of
his
idea
*NL*
disappeared
in
a
blue
haze
of
curses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
stretched
forth
his
arm
.
``
Cross
there
?
''
His
mouth
was
*NL*
puckered
in
doubt
and
awe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
Jest
`
cross
th
'
lot
!
We
ca
n't
stay
here
,
''
screamed
the
*NL*
lieutenant
.
He
poked
his
face
close
to
the
youth
and
waved
his
*NL*
bandaged
hand
.
``
Come
on
!
''
Presently
he
grappled
with
him
as
if
for
a
*NL*
wrestling
bout
.
It
was
as
if
he
planned
to
drag
the
youth
by
the
ear
*NL*
on
to
the
assault
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
private
felt
a
sudden
unspeakable
indignation
against
his
officer
.
*NL*
He
wrenched
fiercely
and
shook
him
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
yerself
,
then
,
''
he
yelled
.
There
was
a
bitter
challenge
in
*NL*
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
galloped
together
down
the
regimental
front
.
The
friend
scrambled
*NL*
after
them
.
In
front
of
the
colors
the
three
men
began
to
bawl
:
``
Come
*NL*
on
!
come
on
!
''
They
danced
and
gyrated
like
tortured
savages
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flag
,
obedient
to
these
appeals
,
bended
its
glittering
form
and
*NL*
swept
toward
them
.
The
men
wavered
in
indecision
for
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
then
with
a
long
,
wailful
cry
the
dilapidated
regiment
surged
forward
*NL*
and
began
its
new
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
the
field
went
the
scurrying
mass
.
It
was
a
handful
of
men
*NL*
splattered
into
the
faces
of
the
enemy
.
Toward
it
instantly
sprang
the
*NL*
yellow
tongues
.
A
vast
quantity
of
blue
smoke
hung
before
them
.
A
*NL*
mighty
banging
made
ears
valueless
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
ran
like
a
madman
to
reach
the
woods
before
a
bullet
could
*NL*
discover
him
.
He
ducked
his
head
low
,
like
a
football
player
.
In
his
*NL*
haste
his
eyes
almost
closed
,
and
the
scene
was
a
wild
blur
.
Pulsating
*NL*
saliva
stood
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
him
,
as
he
hurled
himself
forward
,
was
born
a
love
,
a
despairing
*NL*
fondness
for
this
flag
which
was
near
him
.
It
was
a
creation
of
beauty
*NL*
and
invulnerability
.
It
was
a
goddess
,
radiant
,
that
bended
its
form
*NL*
with
an
imperious
gesture
to
him
.
It
was
a
woman
,
red
and
white
,
*NL*
hating
and
loving
,
that
called
him
with
the
voice
of
his
hopes
.
Because
*NL*
no
harm
could
come
to
it
he
endowed
it
with
power
.
He
kept
near
,
as
if
*NL*
it
could
be
a
saver
of
lives
,
and
an
imploring
cry
went
from
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mad
scramble
he
was
aware
that
the
color
sergeant
flinched
*NL*
suddenly
,
as
if
struck
by
a
bludgeon
.
He
faltered
,
and
then
became
*NL*
motionless
,
save
for
his
quivering
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
spring
and
a
clutch
at
the
pole
.
At
the
same
instant
his
*NL*
friend
grabbed
it
from
the
other
side
.
They
jerked
at
it
,
stout
and
*NL*
furious
,
but
the
color
sergeant
was
dead
,
and
the
corpse
would
not
*NL*
relinquish
its
trust
.
For
a
moment
there
was
a
grim
encounter
.
The
*NL*
dead
man
,
swinging
with
bended
back
,
seemed
to
be
obstinately
tugging
,
*NL*
in
ludicrous
and
awful
ways
,
for
the
possession
of
the
flag
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
past
in
an
instant
of
time
.
They
wrenched
the
flag
furiously
*NL*
from
the
dead
man
,
and
,
as
they
turned
again
,
the
corpse
swayed
forward
*NL*
with
bowed
head
.
One
arm
swung
high
,
and
the
curved
hand
fell
with
*NL*
heavy
protest
on
the
friend
's
unheeding
shoulder
.

CHAPTER
XX
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
two
youths
turned
with
the
flag
they
saw
that
much
of
the
*NL*
regiment
had
crumbled
away
,
and
the
dejected
remnant
was
coming
slowly
*NL*
back
.
The
men
,
having
hurled
themselves
in
projectile
fashion
,
had
*NL*
presently
expended
their
forces
.
They
slowly
retreated
,
with
their
*NL*
faces
still
toward
the
spluttering
woods
,
and
their
hot
rifles
still
*NL*
replying
to
the
din
.
Several
officers
were
giving
orders
,
their
voices
*NL*
keyed
to
screams
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
in
hell
yeh
goin
'
?
''
the
lieutenant
was
asking
in
a
sarcastic
*NL*
howl
.
And
a
red-bearded
officer
,
whose
voice
of
triple
brass
could
*NL*
plainly
be
heard
,
was
commanding
:
``
Shoot
into
'em
!
Shoot
into
'em
,
Gawd
*NL*
damn
their
souls
!
''
There
was
a
melee
of
screeches
,
in
which
the
men
*NL*
were
ordered
to
do
conflicting
and
impossible
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
and
his
friend
had
a
small
scuffle
over
the
flag
.
``
Give
it
*NL*
t
'
me
!
''
``
No
,
let
me
keep
it
!
''
Each
felt
satisfied
with
the
other
's
*NL*
possession
of
it
,
but
each
felt
bound
to
declare
,
by
an
offer
to
carry
*NL*
the
emblem
,
his
willingness
to
further
risk
himself
.
The
youth
roughly
*NL*
pushed
his
friend
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
regiment
fell
back
to
the
stolid
trees
.
There
it
halted
for
a
*NL*
moment
to
blaze
at
some
dark
forms
that
had
begun
to
steal
upon
its
*NL*
track
.
Presently
it
resumed
its
march
again
,
curving
among
the
tree
*NL*
trunks
.
By
the
time
the
depleted
regiment
had
again
reached
the
first
*NL*
open
space
they
were
receiving
a
fast
and
merciless
fire
.
There
seemed
*NL*
to
be
mobs
all
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
greater
part
of
the
men
,
discouraged
,
their
spirits
worn
by
the
*NL*
turmoil
,
acted
as
if
stunned
.
They
accepted
the
pelting
of
the
bullets
*NL*
with
bowed
and
weary
heads
.
It
was
of
no
purpose
to
strive
against
*NL*
walls
.
It
was
of
no
use
to
batter
themselves
against
granite
.
And
*NL*
from
this
consciousness
that
they
had
attempted
to
conquer
an
*NL*
unconquerable
thing
there
seemed
to
arise
a
feeling
that
they
had
been
*NL*
betrayed
.
They
glowered
with
bent
brows
,
but
dangerously
,
upon
some
of
*NL*
the
officers
,
more
particularly
upon
the
red-bearded
one
with
the
voice
*NL*
of
triple
brass
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
rear
of
the
regiment
was
fringed
with
men
,
who
continued
*NL*
to
shoot
irritably
at
the
advancing
foes
.
They
seemed
resolved
to
make
*NL*
every
trouble
.
The
youthful
lieutenant
was
perhaps
the
last
man
in
the
*NL*
disordered
mass
.
His
forgotten
back
was
toward
the
enemy
.
He
had
been
*NL*
shot
in
the
arm
.
It
hung
straight
and
rigid
.
Occasionally
he
would
*NL*
cease
to
remember
it
,
and
be
about
to
emphasize
an
oath
with
a
sweeping
*NL*
gesture
.
The
multiplied
pain
caused
him
to
swear
with
incredible
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
went
along
with
slipping
,
uncertain
feet
.
He
kept
watchful
*NL*
eyes
rearward
.
A
scowl
of
mortification
and
rage
was
upon
his
face
.
He
*NL*
had
thought
of
a
fine
revenge
upon
the
officer
who
had
referred
to
him
*NL*
and
his
fellows
as
mule
drivers
.
But
he
saw
that
it
could
not
come
to
*NL*
pass
.
His
dreams
had
collapsed
when
the
mule
drivers
,
dwindling
*NL*
rapidly
,
had
wavered
and
hesitated
on
the
little
clearing
,
and
then
had
*NL*
recoiled
.
And
now
the
retreat
of
the
mule
drivers
was
a
march
of
shame
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dagger-pointed
gaze
from
without
his
blackened
face
was
held
toward
*NL*
the
enemy
,
but
his
greater
hatred
was
riveted
upon
the
man
,
who
,
not
*NL*
knowing
him
,
had
called
him
a
mule
driver
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
knew
that
he
and
his
comrades
had
failed
to
do
anything
in
*NL*
successful
ways
that
might
bring
the
little
pangs
of
a
kind
of
remorse
*NL*
upon
the
officer
,
the
youth
allowed
the
rage
of
the
baffled
to
possess
*NL*
him
.
This
cold
officer
upon
a
monument
,
who
dropped
epithets
*NL*
unconcernedly
down
,
would
be
finer
as
a
dead
man
,
he
thought
.
So
*NL*
grievous
did
he
think
it
that
he
could
never
possess
the
secret
right
*NL*
to
taunt
truly
in
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
pictured
red
letters
of
curious
revenge
.
``
We
ARE
mule
drivers
,
*NL*
are
we
?
''
And
now
he
was
compelled
to
throw
them
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
presently
wrapped
his
heart
in
the
cloak
of
his
pride
and
kept
the
*NL*
flag
erect
.
He
harangued
his
fellows
,
pushing
against
their
chests
*NL*
with
his
free
hand
.
To
those
he
knew
well
he
made
frantic
appeals
,
*NL*
beseeching
them
by
name
.
Between
him
and
the
lieutenant
,
scolding
and
*NL*
near
to
losing
his
mind
with
rage
,
there
was
felt
a
subtle
fellowship
*NL*
and
equality
.
They
supported
each
other
in
all
manner
of
hoarse
,
*NL*
howling
protests
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
regiment
was
a
machine
run
down
.
The
two
men
babbled
at
a
*NL*
forceless
thing
.
The
soldiers
who
had
heart
to
go
slowly
were
*NL*
continually
shaken
in
their
resolves
by
a
knowledge
that
comrades
were
*NL*
slipping
with
speed
back
to
the
lines
.
It
was
difficult
to
think
of
*NL*
reputation
when
others
were
thinking
of
skins
.
Wounded
men
were
left
*NL*
crying
on
this
black
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smoke
fringes
and
flames
blustered
always
.
The
youth
,
peering
once
*NL*
through
a
sudden
rift
in
a
cloud
,
saw
a
brown
mass
of
troops
,
*NL*
interwoven
and
magnified
until
they
appeared
to
be
thousands
.
A
*NL*
fierce-hued
flag
flashed
before
his
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
,
as
if
the
uplifting
of
the
smoke
had
been
prearranged
,
the
*NL*
discovered
troops
burst
into
a
rasping
yell
,
and
a
hundred
flames
*NL*
jetted
toward
the
retreating
band
.
A
rolling
gray
cloud
again
*NL*
interposed
as
the
regiment
doggedly
replied
.
The
youth
had
to
depend
*NL*
again
upon
his
misused
ears
,
which
were
trembling
and
buzzing
from
the
*NL*
melee
of
musketry
and
yells
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
way
seemed
eternal
.
In
the
clouded
haze
men
became
panicstricken
*NL*
with
the
thought
that
the
regiment
had
lost
its
path
,
and
was
*NL*
proceeding
in
a
perilous
direction
.
Once
the
men
who
headed
the
wild
*NL*
procession
turned
and
came
pushing
back
against
their
comrades
,
*NL*
screaming
that
they
were
being
fired
upon
from
points
which
they
had
*NL*
considered
to
be
toward
their
own
lines
.
At
this
cry
a
hysterical
fear
*NL*
and
dismay
beset
the
troops
.
A
soldier
,
who
heretofore
had
been
*NL*
ambitious
to
make
the
regiment
into
a
wise
little
band
that
would
*NL*
proceed
calmly
amid
the
huge-appearing
difficulties
,
suddenly
sank
down
*NL*
and
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
with
an
air
of
bowing
to
a
doom
.
From
*NL*
another
a
shrill
lamentation
rang
out
filled
with
profane
allusions
to
*NL*
a
general
.
Men
ran
hither
and
thither
,
seeking
with
their
eyes
roads
of
*NL*
escape
.
With
serene
regularity
,
as
if
controlled
by
a
schedule
,
*NL*
bullets
buffed
into
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
walked
stolidly
into
the
midst
of
the
mob
,
and
with
his
flag
*NL*
in
his
hands
took
a
stand
as
if
he
expected
an
attempt
to
push
him
to
*NL*
the
ground
.
He
unconsciously
assumed
the
attitude
of
the
color
bearer
*NL*
in
the
fight
of
the
preceding
day
.
He
passed
over
his
brow
a
hand
that
*NL*
trembled
.
His
breath
did
not
come
freely
.
He
was
choking
during
this
*NL*
small
wait
for
the
crisis
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
came
to
him
.
``
Well
,
Henry
,
I
guess
this
is
good-by
--
John
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shut
up
,
you
damned
fool
!
''
replied
the
youth
,
and
he
would
not
*NL*
look
at
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officers
labored
like
politicians
to
beat
the
mass
into
a
proper
*NL*
circle
to
face
the
menaces
.
The
ground
was
uneven
and
torn
.
The
men
*NL*
curled
into
depressions
and
fitted
themselves
snugly
behind
whatever
*NL*
would
frustrate
a
bullet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
noted
with
vague
surprise
that
the
lieutenant
was
standing
*NL*
mutely
with
his
legs
far
apart
and
his
sword
held
in
the
manner
of
a
*NL*
cane
.
The
youth
wondered
what
had
happened
to
his
vocal
organs
that
he
*NL*
no
more
cursed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
curious
in
this
little
intent
pause
of
the
*NL*
lieutenant
.
He
was
like
a
babe
which
,
having
wept
its
fill
,
raises
its
*NL*
eyes
and
fixes
upon
a
distant
toy
.
He
was
engrossed
in
this
*NL*
contemplation
,
and
the
soft
under
lip
quivered
from
self-whispered
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
lazy
and
ignorant
smoke
curled
slowly
.
The
men
,
hiding
from
the
*NL*
bullets
,
waited
anxiously
for
it
to
lift
and
disclose
the
plight
of
the
*NL*
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silent
ranks
were
suddenly
thrilled
by
the
eager
voice
of
the
*NL*
youthful
lieutenant
bawling
out
:
``
Here
they
come
!
Right
onto
us
,
*NL*
b
`
Gawd
!
''
His
further
words
were
lost
in
a
roar
of
wicked
thunder
from
*NL*
the
men
's
rifles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
's
eyes
had
instantly
turned
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
*NL*
awakened
and
agitated
lieutenant
,
and
he
had
seen
the
haze
of
treachery
*NL*
disclosing
a
body
of
soldiers
of
the
enemy
.
They
were
so
near
that
he
*NL*
could
see
their
features
.
There
was
a
recognition
as
he
looked
at
the
*NL*
types
of
faces
.
Also
he
perceived
with
dim
amazement
that
their
*NL*
uniforms
were
rather
gay
in
effect
,
being
light
gray
,
accented
with
a
*NL*
brilliant-hued
facing
.
Too
,
the
clothes
seemed
new
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
troops
had
apparently
been
going
forward
with
caution
,
their
*NL*
rifles
held
in
readiness
,
when
the
youthful
lieutenant
had
discovered
*NL*
them
and
their
movement
had
been
interrupted
by
the
volley
from
the
*NL*
blue
regiment
.
From
the
moment
's
glimpse
,
it
was
derived
that
they
had
*NL*
been
unaware
of
the
proximity
of
their
dark-suited
foes
or
had
mistaken
*NL*
the
direction
.
Almost
instantly
they
were
shut
utterly
from
the
youth
's
*NL*
sight
by
the
smoke
from
the
energetic
rifles
of
his
companions
.
He
*NL*
strained
his
vision
to
learn
the
accomplishment
of
the
volley
,
but
the
*NL*
smoke
hung
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
bodies
of
troops
exchanged
blows
in
the
manner
of
a
pair
of
*NL*
boxers
.
The
fast
angry
firings
went
back
and
forth
.
The
men
in
blue
*NL*
were
intent
with
the
despair
of
their
circumstances
and
they
seized
*NL*
upon
the
revenge
to
be
had
at
close
range
.
Their
thunder
swelled
loud
*NL*
and
valiant
.
Their
curving
front
bristled
with
flashes
and
the
place
*NL*
resounded
with
the
clangor
of
their
ramrods
.
The
youth
ducked
and
*NL*
dodged
for
a
time
and
achieved
a
few
unsatisfactory
views
of
the
enemy
.
*NL*
There
appeared
to
be
many
of
them
and
they
were
replying
swiftly
.
They
*NL*
seemed
moving
toward
the
blue
regiment
,
step
by
step
.
He
seated
*NL*
himself
gloomily
on
the
ground
with
his
flag
between
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
noted
the
vicious
,
wolflike
temper
of
his
comrades
he
had
a
sweet
*NL*
thought
that
if
the
enemy
was
about
to
swallow
the
regimental
broom
as
*NL*
a
large
prisoner
,
it
could
at
least
have
the
consolation
of
going
down
*NL*
with
bristles
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
blows
of
the
antagonist
began
to
grow
more
weak
.
Fewer
bullets
*NL*
ripped
the
air
,
and
finally
,
when
the
men
slackened
to
learn
of
the
*NL*
fight
,
they
could
see
only
dark
,
floating
smoke
.
The
regiment
lay
*NL*
still
and
gazed
.
Presently
some
chance
whim
came
to
the
pestering
*NL*
blur
,
and
it
began
to
coil
heavily
away
.
The
men
saw
a
ground
vacant
*NL*
of
fighters
.
It
would
have
been
an
empty
stage
if
it
were
not
for
a
*NL*
few
corpses
that
lay
thrown
and
twisted
into
fantastic
shapes
upon
the
*NL*
sward
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
sight
of
this
tableau
,
many
of
the
men
in
blue
sprang
from
behind
*NL*
their
covers
and
made
an
ungainly
dance
of
joy
.
Their
eyes
burned
and
*NL*
a
hoarse
cheer
of
elation
broke
from
their
dry
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
begun
to
seem
to
them
that
events
were
trying
to
prove
that
they
*NL*
were
impotent
.
These
little
battles
had
evidently
endeavored
to
*NL*
demonstrate
that
the
men
could
not
fight
well
.
When
on
the
verge
of
*NL*
submission
to
these
opinions
,
the
small
duel
had
showed
them
that
the
*NL*
proportions
were
not
impossible
,
and
by
it
they
had
revenged
themselves
*NL*
upon
their
misgivings
and
upon
the
foe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
impetus
of
enthusiasm
was
theirs
again
.
They
gazed
about
them
with
*NL*
looks
of
uplifted
pride
,
feeling
new
trust
in
the
grim
,
always
*NL*
confident
weapons
in
their
hands
.
And
they
were
men
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
they
knew
that
no
firing
threatened
them
.
All
ways
seemed
*NL*
once
more
opened
to
them
.
The
dusty
blue
lines
of
their
friends
were
*NL*
disclosed
a
short
distance
away
.
In
the
distance
there
were
many
*NL*
colossal
noises
,
but
in
all
this
part
of
the
field
there
was
a
sudden
*NL*
stillness
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
perceived
that
they
were
free
.
The
depleted
band
drew
a
long
*NL*
breath
of
relief
and
gathered
itself
into
a
bunch
to
complete
its
trip
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
last
length
of
journey
the
men
began
to
show
strange
emotions
.
*NL*
They
hurried
with
nervous
fear
.
Some
who
had
been
dark
and
unfaltering
*NL*
in
the
grimmest
moments
now
could
not
conceal
an
anxiety
that
made
them
*NL*
frantic
.
It
was
perhaps
that
they
dreaded
to
be
killed
in
*NL*
insignificant
ways
after
the
times
for
proper
military
deaths
had
*NL*
passed
.
Or
,
perhaps
,
they
thought
it
would
be
too
ironical
to
get
*NL*
killed
at
the
portals
of
safety
.
With
backward
looks
of
perturbation
,
*NL*
they
hastened
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
approached
their
own
lines
there
was
some
sarcasm
exhibited
on
*NL*
the
part
of
a
gaunt
and
bronzed
regiment
that
lay
resting
in
the
shade
*NL*
of
trees
.
Questions
were
wafted
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
th
'
hell
yeh
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
yeh
comin
'
back
fer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
yeh
stay
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
warm
out
there
,
sonny
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goin
'
home
now
,
boys
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
shouted
in
taunting
mimicry
:
``
Oh
,
mother
,
come
quick
an
'
look
at
*NL*
th
'
sojers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reply
from
the
bruised
and
battered
regiment
,
save
that
*NL*
one
man
made
broadcast
challenges
to
fist
fights
and
the
red-bearded
*NL*
officer
walked
rather
near
and
glared
in
great
swashbuckler
style
at
a
*NL*
tall
captain
in
the
other
regiment
.
But
the
lieutenant
suppressed
the
*NL*
man
who
wished
to
fist
fight
,
and
the
tall
captain
,
flushing
at
the
*NL*
little
fanfare
of
the
red-bearded
one
,
was
obliged
to
look
intently
at
*NL*
some
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
's
tender
flesh
was
deeply
stung
by
these
remarks
.
From
under
*NL*
his
creased
brows
he
glowered
with
hate
at
the
mockers
.
He
meditated
*NL*
upon
a
few
revenges
.
Still
,
many
in
the
regiment
hung
their
heads
in
*NL*
criminal
fashion
,
so
that
it
came
to
pass
that
the
men
trudged
with
*NL*
sudden
heaviness
,
as
if
they
bore
upon
their
bended
shoulders
the
*NL*
coffin
of
their
honor
.
And
the
youthful
lieutenant
,
recollecting
*NL*
himself
,
began
to
mutter
softly
in
black
curses
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
when
they
arrived
at
their
old
position
to
regard
the
*NL*
ground
over
which
they
had
charged
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
in
this
contemplation
was
smitten
with
a
large
astonishment
.
*NL*
He
discovered
that
the
distances
,
as
compared
with
the
brilliant
*NL*
measurings
of
his
mind
,
were
trivial
and
ridiculous
.
The
stolid
trees
,
*NL*
where
much
had
taken
place
,
seemed
incredibly
near
.
The
time
,
too
,
now
*NL*
that
he
reflected
,
he
saw
to
have
been
short
.
He
wondered
at
the
number
*NL*
of
emotions
and
events
that
had
been
crowded
into
such
little
spaces
.
*NL*
Elfin
thoughts
must
have
exaggerated
and
enlarged
everything
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
,
then
,
that
there
was
bitter
justice
in
the
speeches
of
the
*NL*
gaunt
and
bronzed
veterans
.
He
veiled
a
glance
of
disdain
at
his
*NL*
fellows
who
strewed
the
ground
,
choking
with
dust
,
red
from
*NL*
perspiration
,
misty-eyed
,
disheveled
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
gulping
at
their
canteens
,
fierce
to
wring
every
mite
of
*NL*
water
from
them
,
and
they
polished
at
their
swollen
and
watery
features
*NL*
with
coat
sleeves
and
bunches
of
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
to
the
youth
there
was
a
considerable
joy
in
musing
upon
his
*NL*
performances
during
the
charge
.
He
had
had
very
little
time
previously
*NL*
in
which
to
appreciate
himself
,
so
that
there
was
now
much
satisfaction
*NL*
in
quietly
thinking
of
his
actions
.
He
recalled
bits
of
color
that
in
*NL*
the
flurry
had
stamped
themselves
unawares
upon
his
engaged
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
regiment
lay
heaving
from
its
hot
exertions
the
officer
who
had
*NL*
named
them
as
mule
drivers
came
galloping
along
the
line
.
He
had
lost
*NL*
his
cap
.
His
tousled
hair
streamed
wildly
,
and
his
face
was
dark
with
*NL*
vexation
and
wrath
.
His
temper
was
displayed
with
more
clearness
by
the
*NL*
way
in
which
he
managed
his
horse
.
He
jerked
and
wrenched
savagely
at
*NL*
his
bridle
,
stopping
the
hard-breathing
animal
with
a
furious
pull
near
*NL*
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
.
He
immediately
exploded
in
reproaches
*NL*
which
came
unbidden
to
the
ears
of
the
men
.
They
were
suddenly
alert
,
*NL*
being
always
curious
about
black
words
between
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thunder
,
MacChesnay
,
what
an
awful
bull
you
made
of
this
thing
!
''
*NL*
began
the
officer
.
He
attempted
low
tones
,
but
his
indignation
caused
*NL*
certain
of
the
men
to
learn
the
sense
of
his
words
.
``
What
an
awful
*NL*
mess
you
made
!
Good
Lord
,
man
,
you
stopped
about
a
hundred
feet
this
*NL*
side
of
a
very
pretty
success
!
If
your
men
had
gone
a
hundred
feet
*NL*
farther
you
would
have
made
a
great
charge
,
but
as
it
is
--
what
a
lot
of
*NL*
mud
diggers
you
've
got
anyway
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
,
listening
with
bated
breath
,
now
turned
their
curious
eyes
*NL*
upon
the
colonel
.
They
had
a
ragamuffin
interest
in
this
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
was
seen
to
straighten
his
form
and
put
one
hand
forth
in
*NL*
oratorical
fashion
.
He
wore
an
injured
air
;
it
was
as
if
a
deacon
had
*NL*
been
accused
of
stealing
.
The
men
were
wiggling
in
an
ecstasy
of
*NL*
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
of
a
sudden
the
colonel
's
manner
changed
from
that
of
a
deacon
to
*NL*
that
of
a
Frenchman
.
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
Oh
,
well
,
general
,
we
*NL*
went
as
far
as
we
could
,
''
he
said
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
far
as
you
could
?
Did
you
,
b
`
Gawd
?
''
snorted
the
other
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
that
was
n't
very
far
,
was
it
?
''
he
added
,
with
a
glance
of
cold
contempt
*NL*
into
the
other
's
eyes
.
``
Not
very
far
,
I
think
.
You
were
intended
to
*NL*
make
a
diversion
in
favor
of
Whiterside
.
How
well
you
succeeded
your
*NL*
own
ears
can
now
tell
you
.
''
He
wheeled
his
horse
and
rode
stiffly
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
,
bidden
to
hear
the
jarring
noises
of
an
engagement
in
the
*NL*
woods
to
the
left
,
broke
out
in
vague
damnations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
,
who
had
listened
with
an
air
of
impotent
rage
to
the
*NL*
interview
,
spoke
suddenly
in
firm
and
undaunted
tones
.
``
I
do
n't
care
*NL*
what
a
man
is
--
whether
he
is
a
general
or
what
--
if
he
says
th
'
boys
*NL*
did
n't
put
up
a
good
fight
out
there
he
's
a
damned
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lieutenant
,
''
began
the
colonel
,
severely
,
``
this
is
my
own
affair
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
trouble
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
made
an
obedient
gesture
.
``
All
right
,
colonel
,
all
*NL*
right
,
''
he
said
.
He
sat
down
with
an
air
of
being
content
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
that
the
regiment
had
been
reproached
went
along
the
line
.
For
*NL*
a
time
the
men
were
bewildered
by
it
.
``
Good
thunder
!
''
they
ejaculated
,
*NL*
staring
at
the
vanishing
form
of
the
general
.
They
conceived
it
to
be
*NL*
a
huge
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
however
,
they
began
to
believe
that
in
truth
their
efforts
*NL*
had
been
called
light
.
The
youth
could
see
this
conviction
weigh
upon
*NL*
the
entire
regiment
until
the
men
were
like
cuffed
and
cursed
animals
,
*NL*
but
withal
rebellious
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
friend
,
with
a
grievance
in
his
eye
,
went
to
the
youth
.
``
I
wonder
*NL*
what
he
does
want
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
must
think
we
went
out
there
an
'
*NL*
played
marbles
!
I
never
see
sech
a
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
developed
a
tranquil
philosophy
for
these
moments
of
*NL*
irritation
.
``
Oh
,
well
,
''
he
rejoined
,
``
he
probably
did
n't
see
nothing
*NL*
of
it
at
all
and
got
mad
as
blazes
,
and
concluded
we
were
a
lot
of
*NL*
sheep
,
just
because
we
did
n't
do
what
he
wanted
done
.
It
's
a
pity
old
*NL*
Grandpa
Henderson
got
killed
yestirday
--
he
'd
have
known
that
we
did
our
*NL*
best
and
fought
good
.
It
's
just
our
awful
luck
,
that
's
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
so
,
''
replied
the
friend
.
He
seemed
to
be
deeply
wounded
*NL*
at

``
I
should

*NL*
The
youth
spoke
soothingly
to
his
comrade
.
``
Well
,
we
both
did
good

I
'd
*NL*
like
to

good

we

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
we
did

''
declared
the
friend
stoutly
.
``
An
'
I
'd
break
th
'
*NL*
feller

neck
if
he
was
as
big
as

But
we
're
all
right
,
*NL*
anyhow
,
for
I
heard
one
feller
say
that
we
two
fit
th

best
in

*NL*
reg

,
an

they
had
a
great

it

Another

had
t

up

a

more

struck
in

was

a

we
did
fight

is

The
youth
exclaimed
with
sudden
exasperation
:
``
He

I

*NL*
*NL*
He
ceased
because
several
men
had
come
hurrying
up
.
Their
faces
*NL*
expressed
a
bringing
of
great
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

repeated
the
other
,
and
he
arranged
himself
to
*NL*
tell
his

The
others
made
an
excited
circle

they

thrills

pleasure

They

exchanged
a

They

CHAPTER
XXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
woods
again
began
to
pour
forth
the
dark-hued
masses
of
the
*NL*
enemy
the
youth
felt
serene
self-confidence
.
He
smiled
briefly
when
he
*NL*
saw
men
dodge
and
duck
at
the
long
screechings
of
shells
that
were
*NL*
thrown
in
giant
handfuls
over
them
.
He
stood
,
erect
and
tranquil
,
*NL*
watching
the
attack
begin
against
a
part
of
the
line
that
made
a
blue
*NL*
curve
along
the
side
of
an
adjacent
hill
.
His
vision
being
unmolested
*NL*
by
smoke
from
the
rifles
of
his
companions
,
he
had
opportunities
to
see
*NL*
parts
of
the
hard
fight
.
It
was
a
relief
to
perceive
at
last
from
*NL*
whence
came
some
of
these
noises
which
had
been
roared
into
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Off
a
short
way
he
saw
two
regiments
fighting
a
little
separate
battle
*NL*
with
two
other
regiments
.
It
was
in
a
cleared
space
,
wearing
a
*NL*
set-apart
look
.
They
were
blazing
as
if
upon
a
wager
,
giving
and
*NL*
taking
tremendous
blows
.
The
firings
were
incredibly
fierce
and
rapid
.
*NL*
These
intent
regiments
apparently
were
oblivious
of
all
larger
purposes
*NL*
of
war
,
and
were
slugging
each
other
as
if
at
a
matched
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
direction
he
saw
a
magnificent
brigade
going
with
the
*NL*
evident
intention
of
driving
the
enemy
from
a
wood
.
They
passed
in
out
*NL*
of
sight
and
presently
there
was
a
most
awe-inspiring
racket
in
the
*NL*
wood
.
The
noise
was
unspeakable
.
Having
stirred
this
prodigious
*NL*
uproar
,
and
,
apparently
,
finding
it
too
prodigious
,
the
brigade
,
after
*NL*
a
little
time
,
came
marching
airily
out
again
with
its
fine
formation
*NL*
in
nowise
disturbed
.
There
were
no
traces
of
speed
in
its
movements
.
*NL*
The
brigade
was
jaunty
and
seemed
to
point
a
proud
thumb
at
the
yelling
*NL*
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
slope
to
the
left
there
was
a
long
row
of
guns
,
gruff
and
*NL*
maddened
,
denouncing
the
enemy
,
who
,
down
through
the
woods
,
were
*NL*
forming
for
another
attack
in
the
pitiless
monotony
of
conflicts
.
The
*NL*
round
red
discharges
from
the
guns
made
a
crimson
flare
and
a
high
,
*NL*
thick
smoke
.
Occasional
glimpses
could
be
caught
of
groups
of
the
*NL*
toiling
artillerymen
.
In
the
rear
of
this
row
of
guns
stood
a
house
,
*NL*
calm
and
white
,
amid
bursting
shells
.
A
congregation
of
horses
,
tied
*NL*
to
a
long
railing
,
were
tugging
frenziedly
at
their
bridles
.
Men
were
*NL*
running
hither
and
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
detached
battle
between
the
four
regiments
lasted
for
some
time
.
*NL*
There
chanced
to
be
no
interference
,
and
they
settled
their
dispute
by
*NL*
themselves
.
They
struck
savagely
and
powerfully
at
each
other
for
a
*NL*
period
of
minutes
,
and
then
the
lighter-hued
regiments
faltered
and
*NL*
drew
back
,
leaving
the
dark-blue
lines
shouting
.
The
youth
could
see
*NL*
the
two
flags
shaking
with
laughter
amid
the
smoke
remnants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
there
was
a
stillness
,
pregnant
with
meaning
.
The
blue
lines
*NL*
shifted
and
changed
a
trifle
and
stared
expectantly
at
the
silent
woods
*NL*
and
fields
before
them
.
The
hush
was
solemn
and
churchlike
,
save
for
a
*NL*
distant
battery
that
,
evidently
unable
to
remain
quiet
,
sent
a
faint
*NL*
rolling
thunder
over
the
ground
.
It
irritated
,
like
the
noises
of
*NL*
unimpressed
boys
.
The
men
imagined
that
it
would
prevent
their
perched
*NL*
ears
from
hearing
the
first
words
of
the
new
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
a
sudden
the
guns
on
the
slope
roared
out
a
message
of
warning
.
A
*NL*
spluttering
sound
had
begun
in
the
woods
.
It
swelled
with
amazing
*NL*
speed
to
a
profound
clamor
that
involved
the
earth
in
noises
.
The
*NL*
splitting
crashes
swept
along
the
lines
until
an
interminable
roar
was
*NL*
developed
.
To
those
in
the
midst
of
it
it
became
a
din
fitted
to
the
*NL*
universe
.
It
was
the
whirring
and
thumping
of
gigantic
machinery
,
*NL*
complications
among
the
smaller
stars
.
The
youth
's
ears
were
filled
*NL*
up
.
They
were
incapable
of
hearing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
an
incline
over
which
a
road
wound
he
saw
wild
and
desperate
rushes
*NL*
of
men
perpetually
backward
and
forward
in
riotous
surges
.
These
parts
*NL*
of
the
opposing
armies
were
two
long
waves
that
pitched
upon
each
other
*NL*
madly
at
dictated
points
.
To
and
fro
they
swelled
.
Sometimes
,
one
side
*NL*
by
its
yells
and
cheers
would
proclaim
decisive
blows
,
but
a
moment
*NL*
later
the
other
side
would
be
all
yells
and
cheers
.
Once
the
youth
saw
*NL*
a
spray
of
light
forms
go
in
houndlike
leaps
toward
the
waving
blue
*NL*
lines
.
There
was
much
howling
,
and
presently
it
went
away
with
a
vast
*NL*
mouthful
of
prisoners
.
Again
,
he
saw
a
blue
wave
dash
with
such
*NL*
thunderous
force
against
a
gray
obstruction
that
it
seemed
to
clear
the
*NL*
earth
of
it
and
leave
nothing
but
trampled
sod
.
And
always
in
their
*NL*
swift
and
deadly
rushes
to
and
fro
the
men
screamed
and
yelled
like
*NL*
maniacs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Particular
pieces
of
fence
or
secure
positions
behind
collections
of
*NL*
trees
were
wrangled
over
,
as
gold
thrones
or
pearl
bedsteads
.
There
*NL*
were
desperate
lunges
at
these
chosen
spots
seemingly
every
instant
,
*NL*
and
most
of
them
were
bandied
like
light
toys
between
the
contending
*NL*
forces
.
The
youth
could
not
tell
from
the
battle
flags
flying
like
*NL*
crimson
foam
in
many
directions
which
color
of
cloth
was
winning
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
emaciated
regiment
bustled
forth
with
undiminished
fierceness
when
*NL*
its
time
came
.
When
assaulted
again
by
bullets
,
the
men
burst
out
in
a
*NL*
barbaric
cry
of
rage
and
pain
.
They
bent
their
heads
in
aims
of
intent
*NL*
hatred
behind
the
projected
hammers
of
their
guns
.
Their
ramrods
*NL*
clanged
loud
with
fury
as
their
eager
arms
pounded
the
cartridges
into
*NL*
the
rifle
barrels
.
The
front
of
the
regiment
was
a
smoke-wall
*NL*
penetrated
by
the
flashing
points
of
yellow
and
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wallowing
in
the
fight
,
they
were
in
an
astonishingly
short
time
*NL*
resmudged
.
They
surpassed
in
stain
and
dirt
all
their
previous
*NL*
appearances
.
Moving
to
and
fro
with
strained
exertion
,
jabbering
the
*NL*
while
,
they
were
,
with
their
swaying
bodies
,
black
faces
,
and
glowing
*NL*
eyes
,
like
strange
and
ugly
friends
jigging
heavily
in
the
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
,
returning
from
a
tour
after
a
bandage
,
produced
from
a
*NL*
hidden
receptacle
of
his
mind
new
and
portentous
oaths
suited
to
the
*NL*
emergency
.
Strings
of
expletives
he
swung
lashlike
over
the
backs
of
*NL*
his
men
,
and
it
was
evident
that
his
previous
efforts
had
in
nowise
*NL*
impaired
his
resources
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
still
the
bearer
of
the
colors
,
did
not
feel
his
idleness
.
*NL*
He
was
deeply
absorbed
as
a
spectator
.
The
crash
and
swing
of
the
*NL*
great
drama
made
him
lean
forward
,
intent-eyed
,
his
face
working
in
*NL*
small
contortions
.
Sometimes
he
prattled
,
words
coming
unconsciously
*NL*
from
him
in
grotesque
exclamations
.
He
did
not
know
that
he
breathed
;
*NL*
that
the
flag
hung
silently
over
him
,
so
absorbed
was
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
formidable
line
of
the
enemy
came
within
dangerous
range
.
They
could
*NL*
be
seen
plainly
--
tall
,
gaunt
men
with
excited
faces
running
with
long
*NL*
strides
toward
a
wandering
fence
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
sight
of
this
danger
the
men
suddenly
ceased
their
cursing
monotone
.
*NL*
There
was
an
instant
of
strained
silence
before
they
threw
up
their
*NL*
rifles
and
fired
a
plumping
volley
at
the
foes
.
There
had
been
no
*NL*
order
given
;
the
men
,
upon
recognizing
the
menace
,
had
immediately
let
*NL*
drive
their
flock
of
bullets
without
waiting
for
word
of
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
enemy
were
quick
to
gain
the
protection
of
the
wandering
line
*NL*
of
fence
.
They
slid
down
behind
it
with
remarkable
celerity
,
and
from
*NL*
this
position
they
began
briskly
to
slice
up
the
blue
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
latter
braced
their
energies
for
a
great
struggle
.
Often
,
white
*NL*
clinched
teeth
shone
from
the
dusky
faces
.
Many
heads
surged
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
floating
upon
a
pale
sea
of
smoke
.
Those
behind
the
fence
*NL*
frequently
shouted
and
yelped
in
taunts
and
gibelike
cries
,
but
the
*NL*
regiment
maintained
a
stressed
silence
.
Perhaps
,
at
this
new
assault
*NL*
the
men
recalled
the
fact
that
they
had
been
named
mud
diggers
,
and
it
*NL*
made
their
situation
thrice
bitter
.
They
were
breathlessly
intent
upon
*NL*
keeping
the
ground
and
thrusting
away
the
rejoicing
body
of
the
enemy
.
*NL*
They
fought
swiftly
and
with
a
despairing
savageness
denoted
in
their
*NL*
expressions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
had
resolved
not
to
budge
whatever
should
happen
.
Some
*NL*
arrows
of
scorn
that
had
buried
themselves
in
his
heart
had
generated
*NL*
strange
and
unspeakable
hatred
.
It
was
clear
to
him
that
his
final
and
*NL*
absolute
revenge
was
to
be
achieved
by
his
dead
body
lying
,
torn
and
*NL*
gluttering
,
upon
the
field
.
This
was
to
be
a
poignant
retaliation
upon
*NL*
the
officer
who
had
said
``
mule
drivers
,
''
and
later
``
mud
diggers
,
''
for
*NL*
in
all
the
wild
graspings
of
his
mind
for
a
unit
responsible
for
his
*NL*
sufferings
and
commotions
he
always
seized
upon
the
man
who
had
dubbed
*NL*
him
wrongly
.
And
it
was
his
idea
,
vaguely
formulated
,
that
his
corpse
*NL*
would
be
for
those
eyes
a
great
and
salt
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
regiment
bled
extravagantly
.
Grunting
bundles
of
blue
began
to
*NL*
drop
.
The
orderly
sergeant
of
the
youth
's
company
was
shot
through
the
*NL*
cheeks
.
Its
supports
being
injured
,
his
jaw
hung
afar
down
,
disclosing
*NL*
in
the
wide
cavern
of
his
mouth
a
pulsing
mass
of
blood
and
teeth
.
And
*NL*
with
it
all
he
made
attempts
to
cry
out
.
In
his
endeavor
there
was
a
*NL*
dreadful
earnestness
,
as
if
he
conceived
that
one
great
shriek
would
*NL*
make
him
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
saw
him
presently
go
rearward
.
His
strength
seemed
in
nowise
*NL*
impaired
.
He
ran
swiftly
,
casting
wild
glances
for
succor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Others
fell
down
about
the
feet
of
their
companions
.
Some
of
the
*NL*
wounded
crawled
out
and
away
,
but
many
lay
still
,
their
bodies
twisted
*NL*
into
impossible
shapes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
looked
once
for
his
friend
.
He
saw
a
vehement
young
man
,
*NL*
powder-smeared
and
frowzled
,
whom
he
knew
to
be
him
.
The
lieutenant
,
*NL*
also
,
was
unscathed
in
his
position
at
the
rear
.
He
had
continued
to
*NL*
curse
,
but
it
was
now
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
using
his
last
box
*NL*
of
oaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
fire
of
the
regiment
had
begun
to
wane
and
drip
.
The
robust
*NL*
voice
,
that
had
come
strangely
from
the
thin
ranks
,
was
growing
rapidly
*NL*
weak
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
came
running
along
back
of
the
line
.
There
were
other
*NL*
officers
following
him
.
``
We
must
charge
'm
!
''
they
shouted
.
``
We
must
*NL*
charge
'm
!
''
they
cried
with
resentful
voices
,
as
if
anticipating
a
*NL*
rebellion
against
this
plan
by
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
upon
hearing
the
shouts
,
began
to
study
the
distance
between
*NL*
him
and
the
enemy
.
He
made
vague
calculations
.
He
saw
that
to
be
firm
*NL*
soldiers
they
must
go
forward
.
It
would
be
death
to
stay
in
the
*NL*
present
place
,
and
with
all
the
circumstances
to
go
backward
would
*NL*
exalt
too
many
others
.
Their
hope
was
to
push
the
galling
foes
away
*NL*
from
the
fence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
expected
that
his
companions
,
weary
and
stiffened
,
would
have
to
be
*NL*
driven
to
this
assault
,
but
as
he
turned
toward
them
he
perceived
with
*NL*
a
certain
surprise
that
they
were
giving
quick
and
unqualified
*NL*
expressions
of
assent
.
There
was
an
ominous
,
clanging
overture
to
the
*NL*
charge
when
the
shafts
of
the
bayonets
rattled
upon
the
rifle
barrels
.
*NL*
At
the
yelled
words
of
command
the
soldiers
sprang
forward
in
eager
*NL*
leaps
.
There
was
new
and
unexpected
force
in
the
movement
of
the
*NL*
regiment
.
A
knowledge
of
its
faded
and
jaded
condition
made
the
charge
*NL*
appear
like
a
paroxysm
,
a
display
of
the
strength
that
comes
before
a
*NL*
final
feebleness
.
The
men
scampered
in
insane
fever
of
haste
,
racing
*NL*
as
if
to
achieve
a
sudden
success
before
an
exhilarating
fluid
should
*NL*
leave
them
.
It
was
a
blind
and
despairing
rush
by
the
collection
of
*NL*
men
in
dusty
and
tattered
blue
,
over
a
green
sward
and
under
a
sapphire
*NL*
sky
,
toward
a
fence
,
dimly
outlined
in
smoke
,
from
behind
which
*NL*
spluttered
the
fierce
rifles
of
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
kept
the
bright
colors
to
the
front
.
He
was
waving
his
free
*NL*
arm
in
furious
circles
,
the
while
shrieking
mad
calls
and
appeals
,
*NL*
urging
on
those
that
did
not
need
to
be
urged
,
for
it
seemed
that
the
*NL*
mob
of
blue
men
hurling
themselves
on
the
dangerous
group
of
rifles
*NL*
were
again
grown
suddenly
wild
with
an
enthusiasm
of
unselfishness
.
*NL*
From
the
many
firings
starting
toward
them
,
it
looked
as
if
they
would
*NL*
merely
succeed
in
making
a
great
sprinkling
of
corpses
on
the
grass
*NL*
between
their
former
position
and
the
fence
.
But
they
were
in
a
state
*NL*
of
frenzy
,
perhaps
because
of
forgotten
vanities
,
and
it
made
an
*NL*
exhibition
of
sublime
recklessness
.
There
was
no
obvious
questioning
,
*NL*
nor
figurings
,
nor
diagrams
.
There
was
,
apparently
,
no
considered
*NL*
loopholes
.
It
appeared
that
the
swift
wings
of
their
desires
would
*NL*
have
shattered
against
the
iron
gates
of
the
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
himself
felt
the
daring
spirit
of
a
savage
religion
mad
.
He
was
*NL*
capable
of
profound
sacrifices
,
a
tremendous
death
.
He
had
no
time
for
*NL*
dissections
,
but
he
knew
that
he
thought
of
the
bullets
only
as
things
*NL*
that
could
prevent
him
from
reaching
the
place
of
his
endeavor
.
There
*NL*
were
subtle
flashings
of
joy
within
him
that
thus
should
be
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
strained
all
his
strength
.
His
eyesight
was
shaken
and
dazzled
by
*NL*
the
tension
of
thought
and
muscle
.
He
did
not
see
anything
excepting
*NL*
the
mist
of
smoke
gashed
by
the
little
knives
of
fire
,
but
he
knew
that
*NL*
in
it
lay
the
aged
fence
of
a
vanished
farmer
protecting
the
snuggled
*NL*
bodies
of
the
gray
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
ran
a
thought
of
the
shock
of
contact
gleamed
in
his
mind
.
He
*NL*
expected
a
great
concussion
when
the
two
bodies
of
troops
crashed
*NL*
together
.
This
became
a
part
of
his
wild
battle
madness
.
He
could
*NL*
feel
the
onward
swing
of
the
regiment
about
him
and
he
conceived
of
a
*NL*
thunderous
,
crushing
blow
that
would
prostrate
the
resistance
and
*NL*
spread
consternation
and
amazement
for
miles
.
The
flying
regiment
was
*NL*
going
to
have
a
catapultian
effect
.
This
dream
made
him
run
faster
*NL*
among
his
comrades
,
who
were
giving
vent
to
hoarse
and
frantic
cheers
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
presently
he
could
see
that
many
of
the
men
in
gray
did
not
intend
*NL*
to
abide
the
blow
.
The
smoke
,
rolling
,
disclosed
men
who
ran
,
their
*NL*
faces
still
turned
.
These
grew
to
a
crowd
,
who
retired
stubbornly
.
*NL*
Individuals
wheeled
frequently
to
send
a
bullet
at
the
blue
wave
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
one
part
of
the
line
there
was
a
grim
and
obdurate
group
that
*NL*
made
no
movement
.
They
were
settled
firmly
down
behind
posts
and
rails
.
*NL*
A
flag
,
ruffled
and
fierce
,
waved
over
them
and
their
rifles
dinned
*NL*
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blue
whirl
of
men
got
very
near
,
until
it
seemed
that
in
truth
*NL*
there
would
be
a
close
and
frightful
scuffle
.
There
was
an
expressed
*NL*
disdain
in
the
opposition
of
the
little
group
,
that
changed
the
meaning
*NL*
of
the
cheers
of
the
men
in
blue
.
They
became
yells
of
wrath
,
*NL*
directed
,
personal
.
The
cries
of
the
two
parties
were
now
in
sound
an
*NL*
interchange
of
scathing
insults
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
in
blue
showed
their
teeth
;
their
eyes
shone
all
white
.
They
*NL*
launched
themselves
as
at
the
throats
of
those
who
stood
resisting
.
The
*NL*
space
between
dwindled
to
an
insignificant
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
had
centered
the
gaze
of
his
soul
upon
that
other
flag
.
Its
*NL*
possession
would
be
high
pride
.
It
would
express
bloody
minglings
,
*NL*
near
blows
.
He
had
a
gigantic
hatred
for
those
who
made
great
*NL*
difficulties
and
complications
.
They
caused
it
to
be
as
a
craved
*NL*
treasure
of
mythology
,
hung
amid
tasks
and
contrivances
of
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
plunged
like
a
mad
horse
at
it
.
He
was
resolved
it
should
not
*NL*
escape
if
wild
blows
and
darings
of
blows
could
seize
it
.
His
own
*NL*
emblem
,
quivering
and
aflare
,
was
winging
toward
the
other
.
It
seemed
*NL*
there
would
shortly
be
an
encounter
of
strange
beaks
and
claws
,
as
of
*NL*
eagles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
swirling
body
of
blue
men
came
to
a
sudden
halt
at
close
and
*NL*
disastrous
range
and
roared
a
swift
volley
.
The
group
in
gray
was
*NL*
split
and
broken
by
this
fire
,
but
its
riddled
body
still
fought
.
The
*NL*
men
in
blue
yelled
again
and
rushed
in
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
,
in
his
leapings
,
saw
,
as
through
a
mist
,
a
picture
of
four
*NL*
or
five
men
stretched
upon
the
ground
or
writhing
upon
their
knees
with
*NL*
bowed
heads
as
if
they
had
been
stricken
by
bolts
from
the
sky
.
*NL*
Tottering
among
them
was
the
rival
color
bearer
,
whom
the
youth
saw
had
*NL*
been
bitten
vitally
by
the
bullets
of
the
last
formidable
volley
.
He
*NL*
perceived
this
man
fighting
a
last
struggle
,
the
struggle
of
one
whose
*NL*
legs
are
grasped
by
demons
.
It
was
a
ghastly
battle
.
Over
his
face
was
*NL*
the
bleach
of
death
,
but
set
upon
it
was
the
dark
and
hard
lines
of
*NL*
desperate
purpose
.
With
this
terrible
grin
of
resolution
he
hugged
his
*NL*
precious
flag
to
him
and
was
stumbling
and
staggering
in
his
design
to
*NL*
go
the
way
that
led
to
safety
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
wounds
always
made
it
seem
that
his
feet
were
retarded
,
held
,
*NL*
and
he
fought
a
grim
fight
,
as
with
invisible
ghouls
fastened
greedily
*NL*
upon
his
limbs
.
Those
in
advance
of
the
scampering
blue
men
,
howling
*NL*
cheers
,
leaped
at
the
fence
.
The
despair
of
the
lost
was
in
his
eyes
*NL*
as
he
glanced
back
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
's
friend
went
over
the
obstruction
in
a
tumbling
heap
and
*NL*
sprang
at
the
flag
as
a
panther
at
prey
.
He
pulled
at
it
and
,
*NL*
wrenching
it
free
,
swung
up
its
red
brilliancy
with
a
mad
cry
of
*NL*
exultation
even
as
the
color
bearer
,
gasping
,
lurched
over
in
a
final
*NL*
throe
and
,
stiffening
convulsively
,
turned
his
dead
face
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
There
was
much
blood
upon
the
grass
blades
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
place
of
success
there
began
more
wild
clamorings
of
cheers
.
The
*NL*
men
gesticulated
and
bellowed
in
an
ecstasy
.
When
they
spoke
it
was
as
*NL*
if
they
considered
their
listener
to
be
a
mile
away
.
What
hats
and
*NL*
caps
were
left
to
them
they
often
slung
high
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
part
of
the
line
four
men
had
been
swooped
upon
,
and
they
now
*NL*
sat
as
prisoners
.
Some
blue
men
were
about
them
in
an
eager
and
curious
*NL*
circle
.
The
soldiers
had
trapped
strange
birds
,
and
there
was
an
*NL*
examination
.
A
flurry
of
fast
questions
was
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
prisoners
was
nursing
a
superficial
wound
in
the
foot
.
He
*NL*
cuddled
it
,
baby-wise
,
but
he
looked
up
from
it
often
to
curse
with
an
*NL*
astonishing
utter
abandon
straight
at
the
noses
of
his
captors
.
He
*NL*
consigned
them
to
red
regions
;
he
called
upon
the
pestilential
wrath
of
*NL*
strange
gods
.
And
with
it
all
he
was
singularly
free
from
recognition
*NL*
of
the
finer
points
of
the
conduct
of
prisoners
of
war
.
It
was
as
if
a
*NL*
clumsy
clod
had
trod
upon
his
toe
and
he
conceived
it
to
be
his
*NL*
privilege
,
his
duty
,
to
use
deep
,
resentful
oaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
,
who
was
a
boy
in
years
,
took
his
plight
with
great
calmness
*NL*
and
apparent
good
nature
.
He
conversed
with
the
men
in
blue
,
studying
*NL*
their
faces
with
his
bright
and
keen
eyes
.
They
spoke
of
battles
and
*NL*
conditions
.
There
was
an
acute
interest
in
all
their
faces
during
this
*NL*
exchange
of
view
points
.
It
seemed
a
great
satisfaction
to
hear
voices
*NL*
from
where
all
had
been
darkness
and
speculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
captive
sat
with
a
morose
countenance
.
He
preserved
a
*NL*
stoical
and
cold
attitude
.
To
all
advances
he
made
one
reply
without
*NL*
variation
,
``
Ah
,
go
t
'
hell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
of
the
four
was
always
silent
and
,
for
the
most
part
,
kept
his
*NL*
face
turned
in
unmolested
directions
.
From
the
views
the
youth
*NL*
received
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
absolute
dejection
.
Shame
was
*NL*
upon
him
,
and
with
it
profound
regret
that
he
was
,
perhaps
,
no
more
to
*NL*
be
counted
in
the
ranks
of
his
fellows
.
The
youth
could
detect
no
*NL*
expression
that
would
allow
him
to
believe
that
the
other
was
giving
a
*NL*
thought
to
his
narrowed
future
,
the
pictured
dungeons
,
perhaps
,
and
*NL*
starvations
and
brutalities
,
liable
to
the
imagination
.
All
to
be
seen
*NL*
was
shame
for
captivity
and
regret
for
the
right
to
antagonize
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
men
had
celebrated
sufficiently
they
settled
down
behind
the
*NL*
old
rail
fence
,
on
the
opposite
side
to
the
one
from
which
their
foes
*NL*
had
been
driven
.
A
few
shot
perfunctorily
at
distant
marks
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
long
grass
.
The
youth
nestled
in
it
and
rested
,
making
*NL*
a
convenient
rail
support
the
flag
.
His
friend
,
jubilant
and
*NL*
glorified
,
holding
his
treasure
with
vanity
,
came
to
him
there
.
They
*NL*
sat
side
by
side
and
congratulated
each
other

CHAPTER
XXIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
roarings
that
had
stretched
in
a
long
line
of
sound
across
the
face
*NL*
of
the
forest
began
to
grow
intermittent
and
weaker
.
The
stentorian
*NL*
speeches
of
the
artillery
continued
in
some
distant
encounter
,
but
the
*NL*
crashes
of
the
musketry
had
almost
ceased
.
The
youth
and
his
friend
of
*NL*
a
sudden
looked
up
,
feeling
a
deadened
form
of
distress
at
the
waning
*NL*
of
these
noises
,
which
had
become
a
part
of
life
.
They
could
see
*NL*
changes
going
on
among
the
troops
.
There
were
marchings
this
way
and
*NL*
that
way
.
A
battery
wheeled
leisurely
.
On
the
crest
of
a
small
hill
*NL*
was
the
thick
gleam
of
many
departing
muskets
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
arose
.
``
Well
,
what
now
,
I
wonder
?
''
he
said
.
By
his
tone
he
*NL*
seemed
to
be
preparing
to
resent
some
new
monstrosity
in
the
way
of
*NL*
dins
and
smashes
.
He
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
grimy
hand
and
gazed
*NL*
over
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
also
arose
and
stared
.
``
I
bet
we
're
goin
'
t
'
git
along
out
*NL*
of
this
an
'
back
over
th
'
river
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
swan
!
''
said
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
,
watching
.
Within
a
little
while
the
regiment
received
*NL*
orders
to
retrace
its
way
.
The
men
got
up
grunting
from
the
grass
,
*NL*
regretting
the
soft
repose
.
They
jerked
their
stiffened
legs
,
and
*NL*
stretched
their
arms
over
their
heads
.
One
man
swore
as
he
rubbed
his
*NL*
eyes
.
They
all
groaned
``
O
Lord
!
''
They
had
as
many
objections
to
this
*NL*
change
as
they
would
have
had
to
a
proposal
for
a
new
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
trampled
slowly
back
over
the
field
across
which
they
had
run
in
a
*NL*
mad
scamper
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
regiment
marched
until
it
had
joined
its
fellows
.
The
reformed
*NL*
brigade
,
in
column
,
aimed
through
a
wood
at
the
road
.
Directly
they
*NL*
were
in
a
mass
of
dust-covered
troops
,
and
were
trudging
along
in
a
way
*NL*
parallel
to
the
enemy
's
lines
as
these
had
been
defined
by
the
previous
*NL*
turmoil
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
within
view
of
a
stolid
white
house
,
and
saw
in
front
of
it
*NL*
groups
of
their
comrades
lying
in
wait
behind
a
neat
breastwork
.
A
row
*NL*
of
guns
were
booming
at
a
distant
enemy
.
Shells
thrown
in
reply
were
*NL*
raising
clouds
of
dust
and
splinters
.
Horsemen
dashed
along
the
line
*NL*
of
intrenchments
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
of
its
march
the
division
curved
away
from
the
field
and
*NL*
went
winding
off
in
the
direction
of
the
river
.
When
the
significance
*NL*
of
this
movement
had
impressed
itself
upon
the
youth
he
turned
his
head
*NL*
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
toward
the
trampled
and
debris-strewed
*NL*
ground
.
He
breathed
a
breath
of
new
satisfaction
.
He
finally
nudged
*NL*
his
friend
.
``
Well
,
it
's
all
over
,
''
he
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
gazed
backward
.
``
B'Gawd
,
it
is
,
''
he
assented
.
They
mused
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
time
the
youth
was
obliged
to
reflect
in
a
puzzled
and
uncertain
*NL*
way
.
His
mind
was
undergoing
a
subtle
change
.
It
took
moments
for
it
*NL*
to
cast
off
its
battleful
ways
and
resume
its
accustomed
course
of
*NL*
thought
.
Gradually
his
brain
emerged
from
the
clogged
clouds
,
and
at
*NL*
last
he
was
enabled
to
more
closely
comprehend
himself
and
circumstance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
understood
then
that
the
existence
of
shot
and
counter-shot
was
in
*NL*
the
past
.
He
had
dwelt
in
a
land
of
strange
,
squalling
upheavals
and
*NL*
had
come
forth
.
He
had
been
where
there
was
red
of
blood
and
black
of
*NL*
passion
,
and
he
was
escaped
.
His
first
thoughts
were
given
to
*NL*
rejoicings
at
this
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
he
began
to
study
his
deeds
,
his
failures
,
and
his
achievements
.
*NL*
Thus
,
fresh
from
scenes
where
many
of
his
usual
machines
of
reflection
*NL*
had
been
idle
,
from
where
he
had
proceeded
sheeplike
,
he
struggled
to
*NL*
marshal
all
his
acts
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
they
marched
before
him
clearly
.
From
this
present
view
point
*NL*
he
was
enabled
to
look
upon
them
in
spectator
fashion
and
to
criticise
*NL*
them
with
some
correctness
,
for
his
new
condition
had
already
defeated
*NL*
certain
sympathies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Regarding
his
procession
of
memory
he
felt
gleeful
and
unregretting
,
*NL*
for
in
it
his
public
deeds
were
paraded
in
great
and
shining
*NL*
prominence
.
Those
performances
which
had
been
witnessed
by
his
fellows
*NL*
marched
now
in
wide
purple
and
gold
,
having
various
deflections
.
They
*NL*
went
gayly
with
music
.
It
was
pleasure
to
watch
these
things
.
He
*NL*
spent
delightful
minutes
viewing
the
gilded
images
of
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
that
he
was
good
.
He
recalled
with
a
thrill
of
joy
the
*NL*
respectful
comments
of
his
fellows
upon
his
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
ghost
of
his
flight
from
the
first
engagement
*NL*
appeared
to
him
and
danced
.
There
were
small
shoutings
in
his
brain
*NL*
about
these
matters
.
For
a
moment
he
blushed
,
and
the
light
of
his
*NL*
soul
flickered
with
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
specter
of
reproach
came
to
him
.
There
loomed
the
dogging
memory
of
*NL*
the
tattered
soldier
--
he
who
,
gored
by
bullets
and
faint
for
blood
,
had
*NL*
fretted
concerning
an
imagined
wound
in
another
;
he
who
had
loaned
his
*NL*
last
of
strength
and
intellect
for
the
tall
soldier
;
he
who
,
blind
with
*NL*
weariness
and
pain
,
had
been
deserted
in
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
a
wretched
chill
of
sweat
was
upon
him
at
the
thought
*NL*
that
he
might
be
detected
in
the
thing
.
As
he
stood
persistently
*NL*
before
his
vision
,
he
gave
vent
to
a
cry
of
sharp
irritation
and
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
turned
.
``
What
's
the
matter
,
Henry
?
''
he
demanded
.
The
*NL*
youth
's
reply
was
an
outburst
of
crimson
oaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
marched
along
the
little
branch-hung
roadway
among
his
prattling
*NL*
companions
this
vision
of
cruelty
brooded
over
him
.
It
clung
near
him
*NL*
always
and
darkened
his
view
of
these
deeds
in
purple
and
gold
.
*NL*
Whichever
way
his
thoughts
turned
they
were
followed
by
the
somber
*NL*
phantom
of
the
desertion
in
the
fields
.
He
looked
stealthily
at
his
*NL*
companions
,
feeling
sure
that
they
must
discern
in
his
face
evidences
*NL*
of
this
pursuit
.
But
they
were
plodding
in
ragged
array
,
discussing
*NL*
with
quick
tongues
the
accomplishments
of
the
late
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

For
a
time
this
pursuing
recollection
of
the
tattered
man
took
all
*NL*
elation
from
the
youth
's
veins
.
He
saw
his
vivid
error
,
and
he
was
*NL*
afraid
that
it
would
stand
before
him
all
his
life
.
He
took
no
share
*NL*
in
the
chatter
of
his
comrades
,
nor
did
he
look
at
them
or
know
them
,
*NL*
save
when
he
felt
sudden
suspicion
that
they
were
seeing
his
thoughts
*NL*
and
scrutinizing
each
detail
of
the
scene
with
the
tattered
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
gradually
he
mustered
force
to
put
the
sin
at
a
distance
.
And
at
*NL*
last
his
eyes
seemed
to
open
to
some
new
ways
.
He
found
that
he
could
*NL*
look
back
upon
the
brass
and
bombast
of
his
earlier
gospels
and
see
*NL*
them
truly
.
He
was
gleeful
when
he
discovered
that
he
now
despised
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
conviction
came
a
store
of
assurance
.
He
felt
a
quiet
*NL*
manhood
,
nonassertive
but
of
sturdy
and
strong
blood
.
He
knew
that
he
*NL*
would
no
more
quail
before
his
guides
wherever
they
should
point
.
He
*NL*
had
been
to
touch
the
great
death
,
and
found
that
,
after
all
,
it
was
*NL*
but
the
great
death
.
He
was
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
trudged
from
the
place
of
blood
and
wrath
*NL*
his
soul
changed
.
He
came
from
hot
plowshares
to
prospects
of
clover
*NL*
tranquilly
,
and
it
was
as
if
hot
plowshares
were
not
.
Scars
faded
as
*NL*
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
rained
.
The
procession
of
weary
soldiers
became
a
bedraggled
train
,
*NL*
despondent
and
muttering
,
marching
with
churning
effort
in
a
trough
of
*NL*
liquid
brown
mud
under
a
low
,
wretched
sky
.
Yet
the
youth
smiled
,
for
*NL*
he
saw
that
the
world
was
a
world
for
him
,
though
many
discovered
it
to
*NL*
be
made
of
oaths
and
walking
sticks
.
He
had
rid
himself
of
the
red
*NL*
sickness
of
battle
.
The
sultry
nightmare
was
in
the
past
.
He
had
been
*NL*
an
animal
blistered
and
sweating
in
the
heat
and
pain
of
war
.
He
*NL*
turned
now
with
a
lover
's
thirst
to
images
of
tranquil
skies
,
fresh
*NL*
meadows
,
cool
brooks
--
an
existence
of
soft
and
eternal
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
the
river
a
golden
ray
of
sun
came
through
the
hosts
of
leaden
*NL*
rain
clouds
.
