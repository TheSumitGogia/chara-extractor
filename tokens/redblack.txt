INTRODUCTION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Some
slight
sketch
of
the
life
and
character
of
Stendhal
is
*NL*
particularly
necessary
to
an
understanding
of
_
Le
Rouge
et
Le
Noir
_
*NL*
-LRB-
_
The
Red
and
the
Black
_
-RRB-
not
so
much
as
being
the
formal
stuffing
of
*NL*
which
introductions
are
made
,
but
because
the
book
as
a
book
stands
*NL*
in
the
most
intimate
relation
to
the
author
's
life
and
character
.
The
*NL*
hero
,
Julien
,
is
no
doubt
,
viewed
superficially
,
a
cad
,
a
scoundrel
,
*NL*
an
assassin
,
albeit
a
person
who
will
alternate
the
moist
eye
of
the
*NL*
sentimentalist
with
the
ferocious
grin
of
the
beast
of
prey
.
But
*NL*
Stendhal
so
far
from
putting
forward
any
excuses
makes
a
specific
point
*NL*
of
wallowing
defiantly
in
his
own
alleged
wickedness
.
``
Even
assuming
*NL*
that
Julien
is
a
villain
and
that
it
is
my
portrait
,
''
he
wrote
shortly
*NL*
after
the
publication
of
the
book
,
``
why
quarrel
with
me
.
In
the
time
of
*NL*
the
Emperor
,
Julien
would
have
passed
for
a
very
honest
man
.
I
lived
in
*NL*
the
time
of
the
Emperor
.
So
--
but
what
does
it
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henri
Beyle
was
born
in
1783
in
Grenoble
in
Dauphiny
,
the
son
of
a
*NL*
royalist
lawyer
,
situated
on
the
borderland
between
the
gentry
and
*NL*
that
bourgeoisie
which
our
author
was
subsequently
to
chastise
with
*NL*
that
malice
peculiar
to
those
who
spring
themselves
from
the
class
*NL*
which
they
despise
.
The
boy
's
character
was
a
compound
of
sensibility
*NL*
and
hard
rebelliousness
,
virility
and
introspection
.
Orphaned
of
his
*NL*
mother
at
the
age
of
seven
,
hated
by
his
father
and
unpopular
with
his
*NL*
schoolmates
,
he
spent
the
orthodox
unhappy
childhood
of
the
artistic
*NL*
temperament
.
Winning
a
scholarship
at
the
Ecole
Polytechnique
at
*NL*
the
age
of
sixteen
he
proceeded
to
Paris
,
where
with
characteristic
*NL*
independence
he
refused
to
attend
the
college
classes
and
set
himself
*NL*
to
study
privately
in
his
solitary
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1800
the
influence
of
his
relative
M.
Daru
procured
him
a
commission
*NL*
in
the
French
Army
,
and
the
Marengo
campaign
gave
him
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
practising
that
Napoleonic
worship
to
which
throughout
his
life
he
*NL*
remained
consistently
faithful
,
for
the
operation
of
the
philosophical
*NL*
materialism
of
the
French
sceptics
on
an
essentially
logical
and
*NL*
mathematical
mind
soon
swept
away
all
competing
claimants
for
his
*NL*
religious
adoration
.
Almost
from
his
childhood
,
moreover
,
he
had
*NL*
abominated
the
Jesuits
,
and
``
Papism
is
the
source
of
all
crimes
,
''
was
*NL*
throughout
his
life
one
of
his
favourite
maxims
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
army
's
triumphant
entry
into
Milan
,
Beyle
returned
to
*NL*
Grenoble
on
furlough
,
whence
he
dashed
off
to
Paris
in
pursuit
of
*NL*
a
young
woman
to
whom
he
was
paying
some
attention
,
resigned
his
*NL*
commission
in
the
army
and
set
himself
to
study
``
with
the
view
of
*NL*
becoming
a
great
man
.
''
It
is
in
this
period
that
we
find
the
most
*NL*
marked
development
in
Beyle
's
enthusiasm
of
psychology
.
This
tendency
*NL*
sprang
primarily
no
doubt
from
his
own
introspection
.
For
throughout
*NL*
his
life
Beyle
enjoyed
the
indisputable
and
at
times
dubious
luxury
*NL*
of
a
double
consciousness
.
He
invariably
carried
inside
his
brain
*NL*
a
psychological
mirror
which
reflected
every
phrase
of
his
emotion
*NL*
with
scientific
accuracy
.
And
simultaneously
,
the
critical
spirit
,
*NL*
half-genie
,
half-demon
inside
his
brain
,
would
survey
in
the
*NL*
semi-detached
mood
of
a
keenly
interested
spectator
,
the
actual
emotion
*NL*
itself
,
applaud
or
condemn
it
as
the
case
might
be
,
and
ticket
the
*NL*
verdict
with
ample
commentations
in
the
psychological
register
of
its
*NL*
own
analysis
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
trend
to
psychology
,
while
as
we
have
seen
,
to
some
extent
,
*NL*
the
natural
development
of
mere
self-analysis
was
also
tinged
with
the
*NL*
spirit
of
self-preservation
.
With
a
mind
,
which
in
spite
of
its
natural
*NL*
physical
courage
was
morbidly
susceptible
to
ridicule
and
was
only
too
*NL*
frequently
the
dupe
of
the
fear
of
being
duped
,
Stendhal
would
scent
*NL*
an
enemy
in
every
friend
,
and
as
a
mere
matter
of
self-protection
set
*NL*
himself
to
penetrate
the
secret
of
every
character
with
which
he
came
*NL*
into
contact
.
One
is
also
justified
in
taking
into
account
an
honest
*NL*
intellectual
enthusiasm
which
found
its
vent
in
deciphering
the
rarer
*NL*
and
more
precious
manuscripts
of
the
``
human
document
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
exception
of
a
stay
in
Marseilles
,
with
his
first
mistress
*NL*
Melanie
Guilhert
-LRB-
``
a
charming
actress
who
had
the
most
refined
*NL*
sentiments
and
to
whom
I
never
gave
a
sou
,
''
-RRB-
and
a
subsequent
sojourn
*NL*
in
Grenoble
,
Stendhal
remained
in
Paris
till
1806
,
living
so
far
as
was
*NL*
permitted
by
the
modest
allowance
of
his
niggard
father
the
full
life
*NL*
of
the
literary
temperament
.
The
essence
,
however
,
of
his
character
was
*NL*
that
he
was
at
the
same
time
a
man
of
imagination
and
a
man
of
action
.
*NL*
We
consequently
find
him
serving
in
the
Napoleonic
campaigns
of
1806
,
*NL*
1809
and
1812
.
He
was
present
at
the
Battle
of
Jena
,
came
several
*NL*
times
into
personal
contact
with
Napoleon
,
discharged
with
singular
*NL*
efficiency
the
administration
of
the
State
of
Brunswick
,
and
retained
*NL*
his
sangfroid
and
his
bravery
during
the
whole
of
the
panic-stricken
*NL*
retreat
of
the
Moscow
campaign
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
,
moreover
,
to
this
period
that
we
date
Stendhal
's
liaison
with
*NL*
Mme.
Daru
the
wife
of
his
aged
relative
,
M.
Daru
.
This
particular
*NL*
intrigue
has
,
moreover
,
a
certain
psychological
importance
in
that
*NL*
Mme.
Daru
constituted
the
model
on
whom
Mathilde
de
la
Mole
was
drawn
*NL*
in
_
The
Red
and
the
Black
_
.
The
student
and
historian
consequently
who
*NL*
is
anxious
to
check
how
far
the
novelist
is
drawing
on
his
experience
*NL*
and
how
far
on
his
imagination
can
compare
with
profit
the
description
*NL*
of
the
Mathilde
episode
in
_
The
Red
and
the
Black
_
with
those
sections
*NL*
in
Stendhal
's
Journal
entitled
the
_
Life
and
Sentiments
of
Silencious
*NL*
Harry
_
,
_
Memoirs
of
my
Life
during
my
Amour
with
Countess
Palfy
_
,
*NL*
and
also
with
the
posthumous
fragment
,
_
Le
Consultation
de
Banti
_
,
a
*NL*
piece
of
methodical
deliberation
on
the
pressing
question
.
``
Dois-je
ou
*NL*
ne
dois-je
pas
avoir
la
duchesse
?
''
written
with
all
the
documentary
*NL*
coldness
of
a
Government
report
.
It
is
characteristic
that
both
Bansi
*NL*
and
Julien
decide
in
the
affirmative
as
a
matter
of
abstract
principle
.
*NL*
For
they
both
feel
that
they
must
necessarily
reproach
themselves
in
*NL*
after
life
if
they
miss
so
signal
an
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Disgusted
by
the
Restoration
,
Stendhal
migrated
in
1814
to
Milan
,
his
*NL*
favourite
town
in
Europe
,
whose
rich
and
varied
life
he
savoured
to
*NL*
the
full
from
the
celebrated
ices
in
the
entreates
of
the
opera
,
to
*NL*
the
reciprocated
interest
of
Mme.
Angelina
Pietragrua
-LRB-
the
Duchesse
*NL*
de
Sansererina
of
the
Chartreuse
of
Parma
-RRB-
,
``
a
sublime
wanton
a
la
*NL*
Lucrezia
Borgia
''
who
would
appear
to
have
deceived
him
systematically
.
*NL*
It
was
in
Milan
that
Stendhal
first
began
to
write
for
publication
,
*NL*
producing
in
1814
_
The
Lives
of
Haydn
and
Mozart
_
,
and
in
1817
a
series
*NL*
of
travel
sketches
,
_
Rome
,
Naples
,
Florence
_
,
which
was
published
in
*NL*
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
Milan
also
than
Stendhal
first
nursed
the
abstract
thrills
*NL*
of
his
grand
passion
for
Metilde
Countess
Dunbowska
,
whose
angelic
*NL*
sweetness
would
seem
to
have
served
at
any
rate
to
some
extent
as
a
*NL*
prototype
to
the
character
of
Mme.
de
Renal
.
In
1821
the
novelist
was
*NL*
expelled
from
Milan
on
the
apparently
unfounded
accusation
of
being
*NL*
a
French
spy
.
It
is
typical
of
that
mixture
of
brutal
sensuality
and
*NL*
rarefied
sentimentalism
which
is
one
of
the
most
fascinating
features
*NL*
of
Stendhal
's
character
,
that
even
though
he
had
never
loved
more
than
*NL*
the
lady
's
heart
,
he
should
have
remained
for
three
years
faithful
to
*NL*
this
mistress
of
his
ideal
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1822
Stendhal
published
his
treatise
,
_
De
l'Amour
_
,
a
practical
*NL*
scientific
treatise
on
the
erotic
emotion
by
an
author
who
possessed
*NL*
the
unusual
advantage
of
being
at
the
same
time
an
acute
psychologist
*NL*
and
a
brilliant
man
of
the
world
,
who
could
test
abstract
theories
by
*NL*
concrete
practice
and
could
co-ordinate
what
he
had
felt
in
himself
and
*NL*
observe
in
others
into
broad
general
principles
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1825
Stendhal
plunging
vigorously
into
the
controversy
between
the
*NL*
Classicists
and
the
Romanticists
,
published
his
celebrated
pamphlet
,
*NL*
_
Racine
and
Shakespeare
_
,
in
which
he
vindicated
with
successful
*NL*
crispness
the
claims
of
live
verse
against
stereotyped
couplets
and
*NL*
of
modern
analysis
against
historical
tradition
.
His
next
work
was
*NL*
the
_
Life
of
Rossini
_
,
whom
he
had
known
personally
in
Milan
,
while
*NL*
in
1827
he
published
his
first
novel
_
Armance
_
,
which
,
while
not
*NL*
equal
to
the
author
's
greatest
work
,
give
none
the
less
good
promise
*NL*
of
that
analytical
dash
which
he
was
subsequently
to
manifest
.
After
*NL*
_
Armance
_
come
the
well-known
_
Promenades
Rome
_
,
while
the
Stendhalian
*NL*
masterpiece
_
Le
Rouge
et
Le
Noir
_
was
presented
in
1830
to
an
*NL*
unappreciative
public
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enthusiasm
for
this
book
is
the
infallible
test
of
your
true
*NL*
Stendhalian
.
Some
critics
may
prefer
,
possibly
,
the
more
Jamesian
*NL*
delicacy
of
_
Armance
_
,
and
others
fortified
by
the
example
of
Goethe
*NL*
may
avow
their
predilection
for
_
The
Chartreuse
de
Parme
_
with
all
the
*NL*
_
jeune
premier
_
charm
of
its
amiable
hero
.
But
in
our
view
no
book
by
*NL*
Stendhal
is
capable
of
giving
the
reader
such
intellectual
thrills
as
*NL*
that
work
which
has
been
adjudged
to
be
his
greatest
by
Balzac
,
by
*NL*
Taine
,
by
Bourget
.
Certainly
no
other
book
by
Stendhal
than
that
which
*NL*
has
conjured
up
_
Rougistes
_
in
all
countries
in
Europe
has
been
the
*NL*
object
of
a
cult
in
itself
.
We
doubt
,
moreover
,
if
there
is
any
other
*NL*
modern
book
whether
by
Stendhal
or
any
one
else
,
which
has
actually
*NL*
been
learnt
by
heart
by
its
devotees
,
who
,
if
we
may
borrow
the
story
*NL*
told
by
M.
Paul
Bourget
,
are
accustomed
to
challenge
the
authenticity
*NL*
of
each
other
's
knowledge
by
starting
off
with
some
random
passage
only
*NL*
to
find
it
immediately
taken
up
,
as
though
the
book
had
been
the
very
*NL*
Bible
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
personal
appeal
of
what
is
perhaps
the
greatest
romance
*NL*
of
the
intellect
ever
written
lies
in
the
character
of
Julien
,
its
*NL*
villain-hero
.
In
view
of
the
identification
of
Julien
with
Stendhal
*NL*
himself
to
which
we
have
already
alluded
,
it
is
only
fair
to
state
*NL*
that
Stendhal
does
not
appear
to
have
ever
been
a
tutor
in
a
bourgeois
*NL*
family
,
nor
does
history
relate
his
ever
having
made
any
attempt
at
the
*NL*
homicide
of
a
woman
.
So
far
,
in
fact
,
as
what
we
may
call
the
external
*NL*
physical
basis
of
the
story
is
concerned
,
the
material
is
supplied
*NL*
not
by
the
life
of
the
author
,
but
by
the
life
of
a
young
student
of
*NL*
Besancon
,
of
the
name
of
Berthet
,
who
duly
expiated
on
the
threshold
*NL*
that
crime
which
supplied
the
plot
of
this
immortal
novel
.
But
the
*NL*
soul
,
the
brain
of
Julien
is
not
Berthet
but
Beyle
.
And
what
indeed
is
*NL*
the
whole
book
if
not
a
vindication
of
_
beylisme
_
,
if
we
may
use
the
*NL*
word
,
coined
by
the
man
himself
for
his
own
outlook
on
life
?
For
the
*NL*
procedure
of
Stendhal
would
seem
to
have
placed
his
own
self
in
his
*NL*
hero
's
shoes
,
to
have
lived
in
imagination
his
whole
life
,
and
to
have
*NL*
recorded
his
experience
with
a
wealth
of
analytic
detail
,
which
in
*NL*
spite
of
some
arrogance
,
is
yet
both
honest
and
scientific
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
life
of
this
scoundrel
,
this
ingrate
,
this
assassin
,
certainly
*NL*
seems
to
have
been
eminently
worth
living
.
In
its
line
,
indeed
,
it
*NL*
constitutes
a
veritable
triumph
of
idealism
,
a
positive
monument
of
*NL*
``
self-help
.
''
For
judged
by
the
code
of
the
Revolution
,
when
the
career
*NL*
was
open
to
talents
,
the
goodness
or
badness
of
a
man
was
determined
by
*NL*
the
use
he
made
of
his
opportunities
.
Efficiency
was
the
supreme
test
*NL*
of
virtue
,
as
was
failure
the
one
brand
of
unworthiness
.
And
measured
*NL*
by
these
values
Julien
ranks
high
as
an
ethical
saint
.
For
does
he
*NL*
not
sacrifice
everything
to
the
forgiving
of
his
character
and
the
*NL*
hammering
out
of
his
career
?
He
is
by
nature
nervous
,
he
forces
himself
*NL*
to
be
courageous
,
fighting
a
duel
or
capturing
a
woman
,
less
out
of
*NL*
thirst
for
blood
or
hunger
for
flesh
,
than
because
he
thinks
it
due
*NL*
to
his
own
_
parvenu
_
self-respect
to
give
himself
some
concrete
proof
*NL*
on
his
own
moral
force
.
``
Pose
and
affection
''
will
sneer
those
enemies
*NL*
whom
he
will
have
to-day
as
assuredly
as
he
had
them
in
his
lifetime
,
*NL*
the
smug
bourgeois
and
Valenods
of
our
present
age
.
But
the
spirit
*NL*
of
Julien
will
retort
,
``
I
made
myself
master
of
my
affectation
and
I
*NL*
succeeded
in
my
pose
.
''
And
will
he
not
have
logic
on
his
side
?
For
what
*NL*
after
all
is
pose
but
the
pursuit
of
a
subjective
ideal
,
grotesque
no
*NL*
doubt
in
failure
,
but
dignified
by
its
success
.
And
as
M.
Gaultier
has
*NL*
shown
in
his
book
on
_
Bovarysme
_
,
is
not
all
human
progress
simply
the
*NL*
deliberate
change
from
what
one
is
,
into
what
one
is
not
yet
,
but
what
*NL*
nevertheless
one
has
a
tendency
to
be
?
Viewed
from
this
standpoint
*NL*
Julien
's
character
is
what
one
feels
justified
in
calling
a
_
bona
fide
_
*NL*
pose
.
For
speaking
broadly
his
character
is
two-fold
,
half-sensitive
*NL*
tenderness
,
half
ferocious
ambition
,
and
his
pose
simply
consists
*NL*
in
the
subordination
of
his
softer
qualities
for
the
more
effective
*NL*
realization
of
his
harder
.
Considered
on
these
lines
_
Le
Rouge
et
Le
*NL*
Noir
_
stands
pre-eminent
in
European
literature
as
the
tragedy
of
*NL*
energy
and
ambition
,
the
epic
of
the
struggle
for
existence
,
the
modern
*NL*
Bible
of
Nietzschean
self-discipline
.
And
from
the
sheer
romantic
*NL*
aspect
also
the
book
has
its
own
peculiar
charm
.
How
truly
poetic
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
are
the
passages
where
Julien
takes
his
own
mind
alone
into
*NL*
the
mountains
,
plots
out
his
own
fate
,
and
symbolizes
his
own
solitary
*NL*
life
in
the
lonely
circlings
of
a
predatory
hawk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
enemies
will
no
doubt
taunt
him
with
his
introspection
,
while
*NL*
they
point
to
a
character
distorted
,
so
they
say
,
by
the
eternal
mirror
*NL*
of
its
own
consciousness
.
Yet
it
should
be
remembered
that
Julien
lived
*NL*
in
an
age
when
introspection
had
,
so
to
speak
,
been
only
recently
*NL*
invented
,
and
Byronism
and
Wertherism
were
the
stock
food
of
artistic
*NL*
temperaments
.
In
the
case
of
Julien
,
moreover
,
even
though
his
own
*NL*
criticisms
on
his
own
acts
were
to
some
extent
as
important
to
him
as
*NL*
the
actual
acts
themselves
,
his
introspection
was
more
a
strength
than
*NL*
a
weakness
and
never
blunted
the
edge
of
his
drastic
action
.
Compare
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
the
character
of
Julien
with
the
character
of
Robert
*NL*
Greslou
,
the
hero
of
Bourget
's
_
Le
Disciple
_
,
and
the
nearest
analogue
*NL*
to
Julien
in
_
fin
de
siecle
_
literature
,
and
one
will
appreciate
at
*NL*
once
the
difference
between
health
and
decadence
,
virility
and
hysteria
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
most
essential
features
of
the
book
,
however
,
is
the
swing
*NL*
of
the
pendulum
between
Julien
's
ambition
and
Julien
's
tenderness
.
For
*NL*
our
hunter
is
quite
frequently
caught
in
his
own
traps
,
so
that
he
*NL*
falls
genuinely
in
love
with
the
woman
whom
,
as
a
matter
of
abstract
*NL*
principle
,
he
had
specifically
set
himself
to
conquer
.
The
book
*NL*
consequently
as
a
romance
of
love
,
ranks
almost
as
high
as
it
does
as
a
*NL*
romance
of
ambition
.
The
final
idyll
in
prison
with
Mme.
de
Renal
,
in
*NL*
particular
,
is
one
of
the
sweetest
and
purest
in
literature
,
painted
*NL*
in
colours
too
true
ever
to
be
florid
,
steeped
in
a
sentiment
too
deep
*NL*
ever
to
be
mawkish
.
As
moreover
,
orthodox
and
suburban
minds
tend
to
*NL*
regard
all
French
novels
as
specifically
devoted
to
obscene
wallowings
,
*NL*
it
seems
only
relevant
to
mention
that
Stendhal
at
any
rate
never
finds
*NL*
in
sensualism
any
inspiration
for
ecstatic
rhapsodies
,
and
that
he
*NL*
narrates
the
most
specific
episodes
in
the
chastest
style
imaginable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
too
the
sinister
figure
of
the
carpenter
's
son
looms
large
*NL*
over
the
book
,
the
characterization
of
all
the
other
personages
is
*NL*
portrayed
with
consummate
brilliancy
.
For
Stendhal
standing
first
*NL*
outside
his
characters
with
all
the
sceptical
scrutiny
of
a
detached
*NL*
observer
,
then
goes
deep
inside
them
so
that
he
describes
not
merely
*NL*
what
they
do
,
but
why
they
do
it
,
not
merely
what
they
think
,
but
*NL*
why
they
think
it
,
while
he
assigns
their
respective
share
to
innate
*NL*
disposition
,
accident
,
and
environment
,
and
criticizes
his
creations
*NL*
with
an
irony
that
is
only
occasionally
benevolent
.
For
it
must
be
*NL*
confessed
that
Stendhal
approves
of
extremely
few
people
.
True
scion
*NL*
of
the
middle-classes
he
hates
the
bourgeois
because
he
is
bourgeois
,
*NL*
and
the
aristocrat
because
he
is
aristocrat
.
Nevertheless
,
as
a
gallery
*NL*
of
the
most
varied
characters
,
patricians
and
plebeians
,
prudes
and
*NL*
profligates
,
Jesuits
and
Jansenists
,
Kings
and
coachmen
,
bishops
and
*NL*
bourgeois
,
whose
mutual
difference
acts
as
a
most
effective
foil
to
*NL*
each
other
's
reality
,
_
Le
Rouge
et
Le
Noir
_
will
beat
any
novel
outside
*NL*
Balzac
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
would
mention
in
particular
those
two
contrasted
figures
,
Mme.
de
*NL*
Renal
the
_
bourgeoise
passionee
_
,
and
Matilde
de
la
Mole
the
noble
*NL*
damozel
who
enters
into
her
intrigue
out
of
a
deliberate
wish
to
*NL*
emulate
the
exploits
of
a
romantic
ancestress
.
But
after
all
these
*NL*
individuals
stand
out
not
so
much
because
their
characterization
is
*NL*
better
than
that
of
their
fellow-personages
,
but
because
it
is
more
*NL*
elaborate
.
Even
such
minor
characters
,
for
instance
,
as
de
Frilair
,
the
*NL*
lascivious
Jesuit
,
Noiraud
,
the
avaricious
gaoler
,
Mme.
de
Fervaques
,
*NL*
the
amoristic
prude
,
are
all
in
their
respective
ways
real
,
vivid
,
*NL*
convincing
,
no
mere
padded
figures
of
the
imagination
,
but
observed
*NL*
actualities
swung
from
the
lived
life
on
the
written
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
style
of
Stendhal
is
noticeable
from
its
simplicity
,
clear
and
*NL*
cold
,
devoid
of
all
literary
artifice
,
characteristic
of
his
analytic
*NL*
purpose
.
He
is
strenuous
in
his
avoidance
of
affection
.
Though
,
*NL*
however
,
he
never
holds
out
his
style
as
an
aesthetic
delight
in
*NL*
itself
,
he
reaches
occasionally
passages
of
a
rare
and
simple
beauty
.
*NL*
We
would
refer
in
particular
to
the
description
of
Julien
in
the
*NL*
mountains
,
which
we
have
already
mentioned
,
and
to
the
short
but
*NL*
impressive
death
scene
.
His
habit
,
however
,
of
using
language
as
a
*NL*
means
and
never
as
an
end
,
occasionally
revenges
itself
upon
him
in
*NL*
places
where
the
style
,
though
intelligible
,
is
none
the
less
slovenly
,
*NL*
anacoluthic
,
almost
Thucydidean
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
publication
of
_
Le
Rouge
et
Le
Noir
_
Stendhal
was
forced
*NL*
by
his
financial
embarrassment
to
leave
Paris
and
take
up
the
post
*NL*
of
consul
at
Trieste
.
Driven
from
this
position
by
the
intrigues
of
*NL*
a
vindictive
Church
he
was
transferred
to
Civita
Vecchia
where
he
*NL*
remained
till
1835
,
solacing
his
ennui
by
the
compilation
of
his
*NL*
autobiography
and
thinking
seriously
of
marriage
with
the
rich
and
*NL*
highly
respectable
daughter
of
his
laundress
.
He
then
returned
to
Paris
*NL*
where
he
remained
till
1842
,
where
he
died
suddenly
at
the
age
of
*NL*
fifty-nine
in
the
full
swing
of
all
his
mental
and
physical
activities
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
later
works
included
,
_
La
Chartreuse
de
Parme
_
,
_
Lucien
,
Leuwen
_
*NL*
and
_
Lamiel
_
,
of
which
the
_
Chartreuse
_
is
the
most
celebrated
,
but
*NL*
_
Lamiel
_
certainly
the
most
sprightly
.
But
it
is
on
_
Le
Rouge
et
Le
*NL*
Noir
_
that
his
fame
as
a
novelist
is
the
most
firmly
based
.
It
is
*NL*
with
this
most
personal
document
,
this
record
of
his
experiences
*NL*
and
emotions
that
he
lives
identified
,
just
as
D'Annunzio
will
live
*NL*
identified
with
_
Il
Fuoco
_
or
Mr.
Wells
with
the
_
New
Machiavelli
_
.
*NL*
_
Le
Rouge
et
Le
Noir
_
is
the
greatest
novel
of
its
age
and
one
of
the
*NL*
greatest
novels
of
the
whole
nineteenth
century
.
It
is
full
to
the
brim
*NL*
of
intellect
and
adventure
,
introspection
and
action
,
youth
,
romance
,
*NL*
tenderness
,
cynicism
and
rebellion
.
It
is
in
a
word
the
intellectual
*NL*
quintessence
of
the
Napoleonic
era

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
town
of
Verrieres
can
pass
for
one
of
the
prettiest
in
*NL*
Franche-Comte
.
Its
white
houses
with
their
pointed
red-tiled
roofs
*NL*
stretch
along
the
slope
of
a
hill
,
whose
slightest
undulations
are
*NL*
marked
by
groups
of
vigorous
chestnuts
.
The
Doubs
flows
to
within
some
*NL*
hundred
feet
above
its
fortifications
,
which
were
built
long
ago
by
the
*NL*
Spaniards
,
and
are
now
in
ruins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Verrieres
is
sheltered
on
the
north
by
a
high
mountain
which
is
one
of
*NL*
the
branches
of
the
Jura
.
The
jagged
peaks
of
the
Verra
are
covered
*NL*
with
snow
from
the
beginning
of
the
October
frosts
.
A
torrent
which
*NL*
rushes
down
from
the
mountains
traverses
Verrieres
before
throwing
*NL*
itself
into
the
Doubs
,
and
supplies
the
motive
power
for
a
great
number
*NL*
of
saw
mills
.
The
industry
is
very
simple
,
and
secures
a
certain
*NL*
prosperity
to
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
who
are
more
peasant
than
*NL*
bourgeois
.
It
is
not
,
however
,
the
wood
saws
which
have
enriched
this
*NL*
little
town
.
It
is
the
manufacture
of
painted
tiles
,
called
Mulhouse
*NL*
tiles
,
that
is
responsible
for
that
general
affluence
which
has
caused
*NL*
the
facades
of
nearly
all
the
houses
in
Verrieres
to
be
rebuilt
since
*NL*
the
fall
of
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
has
scarcely
entered
the
town
,
before
one
is
stunned
by
the
din
of
*NL*
a
strident
machine
of
terrifying
aspect
.
Twenty
heavy
hammers
which
*NL*
fall
with
a
noise
that
makes
the
paved
floor
tremble
,
are
lifted
*NL*
up
by
a
wheel
set
in
motion
by
the
torrent
.
Each
of
these
hammers
*NL*
manufactures
every
day
I
do
n't
know
how
many
thousands
of
nails
.
The
*NL*
little
pieces
of
iron
which
are
rapidly
transformed
into
nails
by
these
*NL*
enormous
hammers
,
are
put
in
position
by
fresh
pretty
young
girls
.
This
*NL*
labour
so
rough
at
first
sight
is
one
of
the
industries
which
most
*NL*
surprises
the
traveller
who
penetrates
for
the
first
time
the
mountains
*NL*
which
separate
France
and
Helvetia
.
If
when
he
enters
Verrieres
,
the
*NL*
traveller
asks
who
owns
this
fine
nail
factory
which
deafens
everybody
*NL*
who
goes
up
the
Grande-Rue
,
he
is
answered
in
a
drawling
tone
``
Eh
!
*NL*
it
belongs
to
M.
the
Mayor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
the
traveller
stops
a
few
minutes
in
that
Grande-Rue
of
*NL*
Verrieres
which
goes
on
an
upward
incline
from
the
bank
of
the
Doubs
to
*NL*
nearly
as
far
as
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
it
is
a
hundred
to
one
that
he
*NL*
will
see
a
big
man
with
a
busy
and
important
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
comes
in
sight
all
hats
are
quickly
taken
off
.
His
hair
is
*NL*
grizzled
and
he
is
dressed
in
grey
.
He
is
a
Knight
of
several
Orders
,
*NL*
has
a
large
forehead
and
an
aquiline
nose
,
and
if
you
take
him
all
*NL*
round
,
his
features
are
not
devoid
of
certain
regularity
.
One
might
*NL*
even
think
on
the
first
inspection
that
it
combines
with
the
dignity
*NL*
of
the
village
mayor
that
particular
kind
of
comfortableness
which
is
*NL*
appropriate
to
the
age
of
forty-eight
or
fifty
.
But
soon
the
traveller
*NL*
from
Paris
will
be
shocked
by
a
certain
air
of
self-satisfaction
and
*NL*
self-complacency
mingled
with
an
almost
indefinable
narrowness
and
lack
*NL*
of
inspiration
.
One
realises
at
last
that
this
man
's
talent
is
limited
*NL*
to
seeing
that
he
is
paid
exactly
what
he
is
owed
,
and
in
paying
his
*NL*
own
debts
at
the
latest
possible
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
M.
de
Renal
,
the
mayor
of
Verrieres
.
After
having
crossed
the
*NL*
road
with
a
solemn
step
,
he
enters
the
mayoral
residence
and
disappears
*NL*
from
the
eye
of
the
traveller
.
But
if
the
latter
continues
to
walk
*NL*
a
hundred
steps
further
up
,
he
will
perceive
a
house
with
a
fairly
*NL*
fine
appearance
,
with
some
magnificent
gardens
behind
an
iron
grill
*NL*
belonging
to
the
house
.
Beyond
that
is
an
horizon
line
formed
by
the
*NL*
hills
of
Burgundy
,
which
seem
ideally
made
to
delight
the
eyes
.
This
*NL*
view
causes
the
traveller
to
forget
that
pestilential
atmosphere
of
*NL*
petty
money-grubbing
by
which
he
is
beginning
to
be
suffocated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
told
that
this
house
belongs
to
M.
de
Renal
.
It
is
to
the
*NL*
profits
which
he
has
made
out
of
his
big
nail
factory
that
the
mayor
*NL*
of
Verrieres
owes
this
fine
residence
of
hewn
stone
which
he
is
just
*NL*
finishing
.
His
family
is
said
to
be
Spanish
and
ancient
,
and
is
alleged
*NL*
to
have
been
established
in
the
country
well
before
the
conquest
of
*NL*
Louis
XIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
1815
,
he
blushes
at
being

manufacturer

made
him
mayor
*NL*
of
Verrieres
.
The
terraced
walls
of
this
magnificent
garden
which
*NL*
descends
to
the
Doubs
,
plateau
by
plateau
,
also
represent
the
reward
*NL*
of
M.
de
Renal
's
proficiency
in
the
iron-trade
.
Do
not
expect
to
find
*NL*
in
France
those
picturesque
gardens
which
surround
the
manufacturing
*NL*
towns
of
Germany
,
like
Leipsic
,
Frankfurt
and
Nurenburgh
,
etc.
.
The
*NL*
more
walls
you
build
in
Franche-Comte
and
the
more
you
fortify
your
*NL*
estate
with
piles
of
stone
,
the
more
claim
you
will
acquire
on
the
*NL*
respect
of
your
neighbours
.
Another
reason
for
the
admiration
due
to
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
's
gardens
and
their
numerous
walls
,
is
the
fact
that
he
*NL*
has
purchased
,
through
sheer
power
of
the
purse
,
certain
small
parcels
*NL*
of
the
ground
on
which
they
stand
.
That
saw-mill
,
for
instance
,
whose
*NL*
singular
position
on
the
banks
of
the
Doubs
struck
you
when
you
entered
*NL*
Verrieres
,
and
where
you
notice
the
name
of
SOREL
written
in
gigantic
*NL*
characters
on
the
chief
beam
of
the
roof
,
used
to
occupy
six
years
*NL*
ago
that
precise
space
on
which
is
now
reared
the
wall
of
the
fourth
*NL*
terrace
in
M.
de
Renal
's
gardens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Proud
man
that
he
was
,
the
mayor
had
none
the
less
to
negotiate
with
*NL*
that
tough
,
stubborn
peasant
,
old
Sorel
.
He
had
to
pay
him
in
good
*NL*
solid
golden
louis
before
he
could
induce
him
to
transfer
his
workshop
*NL*
elsewhere
.
As
to
the
_
public
_
stream
which
supplied
the
motive
power
*NL*
for
the
saw-mill
,
M.
de
Renal
obtained
its
diversion
,
thanks
to
the
*NL*
influence
which
he
enjoyed
at
Paris
.
This
favour
was
accorded
him
after
*NL*
the
election
of
182
-
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
Sorel
four
acres
for
every
one
he
had
previously
held
,
five
*NL*
hundred
yards
lower
down
on
the
banks
of
the
Doubs
.
Although
this
*NL*
position
was
much
more
advantageous
for
his
pine-plank
trade
,
father
*NL*
Sorel
-LRB-
as
he
is
called
since
he
has
become
rich
-RRB-
knew
how
to
exploit
*NL*
the
impatience
and
_
mania
for
landed
ownership
_
which
animated
his
*NL*
neighbour
to
the
tune
of
six
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
this
arrangement
was
criticised
by
the
wiseacres
of
the
*NL*
locality
.
One
day
,
it
was
on
a
Sunday
four
years
later
,
as
M.
de
Renal
*NL*
was
coming
back
from
church
in
his
mayor
's
uniform
,
he
saw
old
Sorel
*NL*
smiling
at
him
,
as
he
stared
at
him
some
distance
away
surrounded
by
*NL*
his
three
sons
.
That
smile
threw
a
fatal
flood
of
light
into
the
soul
*NL*
of
the
mayor
.
From
that
time
on
,
he
is
of
opinion
that
he
could
have
*NL*
obtained
the
exchange
at
a
cheaper
rate
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
win
the
public
esteem
of
Verrieres
it
is
essential
that
,
*NL*
though
you
should
build
as
many
walls
as
you
can
,
you
should
not
adopt
*NL*
some
plan
imported
from
Italy
by
those
masons
who
cross
the
passes
*NL*
of
the
Jura
in
the
spring
on
their
way
to
Paris
.
Such
an
innovation
*NL*
would
bring
down
upon
the
head
of
the
imprudent
builder
an
eternal
*NL*
reputation
for
_
wrongheadedness
_
,
and
he
will
be
lost
for
ever
in
the
*NL*
sight
of
those
wise
,
well-balanced
people
who
dispense
public
esteem
in
*NL*
Franche-Comte
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
these
prudent
people
exercise
in
the
place
the
*NL*
most
offensive
despotism
.
It
is
by
reason
of
this
awful
word
,
that
*NL*
anyone
who
has
lived
in
that
great
republic
which
is
called
Paris
,
*NL*
finds
living
in
little
towns
quite
intolerable
.
The
tyranny
of
public
*NL*
opinion
-LRB-
and
what
public
opinion
!
-RRB-
is
as
_
stupid
_
in
the
little
towns
*NL*
of
France
as
in
the
United
States
of
America
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
A
MAYOR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Importance
!
What
is
it
,
sir
after
all
?
The
respect
of
*NL*
fools
,
the
wonder
of
children
,
the
envy
of
the
rich
,
the
*NL*
contempt
of
the
wise
man
.
--
_
Barnave
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
for
the
reputation
of
M.
de
Renal
as
an
administrator
an
*NL*
immense
wall
of
support
was
necessary
for
the
public
promenade
which
*NL*
goes
along
the
hill
,
a
hundred
steps
above
the
course
of
the
Doubs
.
*NL*
This
admirable
position
secures
for
the
promenade
one
of
the
most
*NL*
picturesque
views
in
the
whole
of
France
.
But
the
rain
water
used
to
*NL*
make
furrows
in
the
walk
every
spring
,
caused
ditches
to
appear
,
and
*NL*
rendered
it
generally
impracticable
.
This
nuisance
,
which
was
felt
*NL*
by
the
whole
town
,
put
M.
de
Renal
in
the
happy
position
of
being
*NL*
compelled
to
immortalise
his
administration
by
building
a
wall
twenty
*NL*
feet
high
and
thirty
to
forty
yards
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
parapet
of
this
wall
,
which
occasioned
M.
de
Renal
three
journeys
*NL*
to
Paris
-LRB-
for
the
last
Minister
of
the
Interior
but
one
had
declared
*NL*
himself
the
mortal
enemy
of
the
promenade
of
Verrieres
-RRB-
,
is
now
raised
*NL*
to
a
height
of
four
feet
above
the
ground
,
and
as
though
to
defy
all
*NL*
ministers
whether
past
or
present
,
it
is
at
present
adorned
with
tiles
*NL*
of
hewn
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
many
times
have
my
looks
plunged
into
the
valley
of
the
Doubs
,
as
I
*NL*
thought
of
the
Paris
balls
which
I
had
abandoned
on
the
previous
night
,
*NL*
and
leant
my
breast
against
the
great
blocks
of
stone
,
whose
beautiful
*NL*
grey
almost
verged
on
blue
.
Beyond
the
left
bank
,
there
wind
five
*NL*
or
six
valleys
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
I
could
see
quite
distinctly
*NL*
several
small
streams
.
There
is
a
view
of
them
falling
into
the
Doubs
,
*NL*
after
a
series
of
cascades
.
The
sun
is
very
warm
in
these
mountains
.
*NL*
When
it
beats
straight
down
,
the
pensive
traveller
on
the
terrace
*NL*
finds
shelter
under
some
magnificent
plane
trees
.
They
owe
their
rapid
*NL*
growth
and
their
fine
verdure
with
its
almost
bluish
shade
to
the
new
*NL*
soil
,
which
M.
the
mayor
has
had
placed
behind
his
immense
wall
of
*NL*
support
for
-LRB-
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
the
Municipal
Council
-RRB-
he
*NL*
has
enlarged
the
promenade
by
more
than
six
feet
-LRB-
and
although
he
is
an
*NL*
Ultra
and
I
am
a
Liberal
,
I
praise
him
for
it
-RRB-
,
and
that
is
why
both
in
*NL*
his
opinion
and
in
that
of
M.
Valenod
,
the
fortunate
Director
of
the
*NL*
workhouse
of
Verrieres
,
this
terrace
can
brook
comparison
with
that
of
*NL*
Saint-Germain
en
Laye
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
find
personally
only
one
thing
at
which
to
cavil
in
the
COURS
DE
LA
*NL*
FIDELITE
,
-LRB-
this
official
name
is
to
be
read
in
fifteen
to
twenty
places
*NL*
on
those
immortal
tiles
which
earned
M.
de
Renal
an
extra
cross
.
-RRB-
The
*NL*
grievance
I
find
in
the
Cours
de
la
Fidelite
is
the
barbarous
manner
in
*NL*
which
the
authorities
have
cut
these
vigorous
plane
trees
and
clipped
*NL*
them
to
the
quick
.
In
fact
they
really
resemble
with
their
dwarfed
,
*NL*
rounded
and
flattened
heads
the
most
vulgar
plants
of
the
vegetable
*NL*
garden
,
while
they
are
really
capable
of
attaining
the
magnificent
*NL*
development
of
the
English
plane
trees
.
But
the
wish
of
M.
the
mayor
*NL*
is
despotic
,
and
all
the
trees
belonging
to
the
municipality
are
*NL*
ruthlessly
pruned
twice
a
year
.
The
local
Liberals
suggest
,
but
they
*NL*
are
probably
exaggerating
,
that
the
hand
of
the
official
gardener
*NL*
has
become
much
more
severe
,
since
M.
the
Vicar
Maslon
started
*NL*
appropriating
the
clippings
.
This
young
ecclesiastic
was
sent
to
*NL*
Besancon
some
years
ago
to
keep
watch
on
the
abbe
Chelan
and
some
cures
*NL*
in
the
neighbouring
districts
.
An
old
Surgeon-Major
of
Napoleon
's
*NL*
Italian
Army
,
who
was
living
in
retirement
at
Verrieres
,
and
who
had
*NL*
been
in
his
time
described
by
M.
the
mayor
as
both
a
Jacobin
and
a
*NL*
Bonapartiste
,
dared
to
complain
to
the
mayor
one
day
of
the
periodical
*NL*
mutilation
of
these
fine
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
the
shade
,
''
answered
M.
de
Renal
,
with
just
a
tinge
of
that
*NL*
hauteur
which
becomes
a
mayor
when
he
is
talking
to
a
surgeon
,
who
is
*NL*
a
member
of
the
Legion
of
Honour
.
``
I
like
the
shade
,
I
have
_
my
_
trees
*NL*
clipped
in
order
to
give
shade
,
and
I
can
not
conceive
that
a
tree
can
*NL*
have
any
other
purpose
,
provided
of
course
_
it
is
not
bringing
in
any
*NL*
profit
_
,
like
the
useful
walnut
tree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
great
word
which
is
all
decisive
at
Verrieres
.
``
BRINGING
IN
*NL*
PROFIT
,
''
this
word
alone
sums
up
the
habitual
trend
of
thought
of
more
*NL*
than
three-quarters
of
the
inhabitants
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Bringing
in
profit
_
is
the
consideration
which
decides
everything
in
*NL*
this
little
town
which
you
thought
so
pretty
.
The
stranger
who
arrives
*NL*
in
the
town
is
fascinated
by
the
beauty
of
the
fresh
deep
valleys
which
*NL*
surround
it
,
and
he
imagines
at
first
that
the
inhabitants
have
an
*NL*
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
.
They
talk
only
too
frequently
of
the
*NL*
beauty
of
their
country
,
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
they
lay
great
*NL*
stress
on
it
,
but
the
reason
is
that
it
attracts
a
number
of
strangers
,
*NL*
whose
money
enriches
the
inn-keepers
,
a
process
which
_
brings
in
*NL*
profit
_
to
the
town
,
owing
to
the
machinery
of
the
octroi
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
a
fine
,
autumn
day
that
M.
de
Renal
was
taking
a
promenade
*NL*
on
the
Cours
de
la
Fidelite
with
his
wife
on
his
arm
.
While
listening
*NL*
to
her
husband
-LRB-
who
was
talking
in
a
somewhat
solemn
manner
-RRB-
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
followed
anxiously
with
her
eyes
the
movements
of
three
little
*NL*
boys
.
The
eldest
,
who
might
have
been
eleven
years
old
,
went
too
*NL*
frequently
near
the
parapet
and
looked
as
though
he
was
going
to
climb
*NL*
up
it
.
A
sweet
voice
then
pronounced
the
name
of
Adolphe
and
the
child
*NL*
gave
up
his
ambitious
project
.
Madame
de
Renal
seemed
a
woman
of
thirty
*NL*
years
of
age
but
still
fairly
pretty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
may
be
sorry
for
it
,
may
this
fine
gentleman
from
Paris
,
''
said
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
,
with
an
offended
air
and
a
face
even
paler
than
usual
.
*NL*
``
I
am
not
without
a
few
friends
at
court
!
''
But
though
I
want
to
*NL*
talk
to
you
about
the
provinces
for
two
hundred
pages
,
I
lack
the
*NL*
requisite
barbarity
to
make
you
undergo
all
the
long-windedness
and
*NL*
circumlocutions
of
a
provincial
dialogue
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
fine
gentleman
from
Paris
,
who
was
so
odious
to
the
mayor
of
*NL*
Verrieres
,
was
no
other
than
the
M.
Appert
,
who
had
two
days
previously
*NL*
managed
to
find
his
way
not
only
into
the
prison
and
workhouse
of
*NL*
Verrieres
,
but
also
into
the
hospital
,
which
was
gratuitously
conducted
*NL*
by
the
mayor
and
the
principal
proprietors
of
the
district
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Madame

timidly
,
``
what
harm
can
this
Paris

do
you

THE
POOR
FUND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
virtuous
cure
who
does
not
intrigue
is
a
providence
*NL*
for
the
village
.
--
_
Fleury
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
should
be
mentioned
that
the
cure
of
Verrieres
,
an
old
man
of
*NL*
ninety
,
who
owed
to
the
bracing
mountain
air
an
iron
constitution
and
*NL*
an
iron
character
,
had
the
right
to
visit
the
prison
,
the
hospital
and
*NL*
the
workhouse
at
any
hour
.
It
had
been
at
precisely
six
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
that
M.
Appert
,
who
had
a
Paris
recommendation
to
the
cure
,
*NL*
had
been
shrewd
enough
to
arrive
at
a
little
inquisitive
town
.
He
had
*NL*
immediately
gone
on
to
the
cure
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cure
Chelan
became
pensive
as
he
read
the
letter
written
to
him
by
*NL*
the
M.
le
Marquis
de
La
Mole
,
Peer
of
France
,
and
the
richest
landed
*NL*
proprietor
of
the
province
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
old
and
beloved
here
,
''
he
said
to
himself
in
a
whisper
,
``
they
*NL*
would
not
dare
!
''
Then
he
suddenly
turned
to
the
gentleman
from
Paris
,
*NL*
with
eyes
,
which
in
spite
of
his
great
age
,
shone
with
that
sacred
fire
*NL*
which
betokens
the
delight
of
doing
a
fine
but
slightly
dangerous
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
with
me
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
please
do
not
express
any
opinion
of
*NL*
the
things
which
we
shall
see
,
in
the
presence
of
the
jailer
,
and
above
*NL*
all
not
in
the
presence
of
the
superintendents
of
the
workhouse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Appert
realised
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
man
of
spirit
.
He
followed
*NL*
the
venerable
cure
,
visited
the
hospital
and
workhouse
,
put
a
lot
of
*NL*
questions
,
but
in
spite
of
somewhat
extraordinary
answers
,
did
not
*NL*
indulge
in
the
slightest
expression
of
censure
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
visit
lasted
several
hours
;
the
cure
invited
M.
Appert
to
dine
,
*NL*
but
the
latter
made
the
excuse
of
having
some
letters
to
write
;
as
a
*NL*
matter
of
fact
,
he
did
not
wish
to
compromise
his
generous
companion
to
*NL*
any
further
extent
.
About
three
o'clock
these
gentlemen
went
to
finish
*NL*
their
inspection
of
the
workhouse
and
then
returned
to
the
prison
.
*NL*
There
they
found
the
jailer
by
the
gate
,
a
kind
of
giant
,
six
feet
*NL*
high
,
with
bow
legs
.
His
ignoble
face
had
become
hideous
by
reason
of
*NL*
his
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
,
''
he
said
to
the
cure
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
,
``
is
not
the
*NL*
gentleman
whom
I
see
there
,
M.
Appert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
that
matter
?
''
said
the
cure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
reason
is
that
I
received
yesterday
the
most
specific
orders
,
and
*NL*
M.
the
Prefect
sent
a
message
by
a
gendarme
who
must
have
galloped
*NL*
during
the
whole
of
the
night
,
that
M.
Appert
was
not
to
be
allowed
in
*NL*
the
prisons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
,
M.
Noiroud
,
''
said
the
cure
,
``
that
the
traveller
who
is
*NL*
with
me
is
M.
Appert
,
but
do
you
or
do
you
not
admit
that
I
have
the
*NL*
right
to
enter
the
prison
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
accompanied
*NL*
by
anybody
I
choose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
M.
the
cure
,
''
said
the
jailer
in
a
low
voice
,
lowering
his
head
*NL*
like
a
bull-dog
,
induced
to
a
grudging
obedience
by
fear
of
the
stick
,
*NL*
``
only
,
M.
the
cure
,
I
have
a
wife
and
children
,
and
shall
be
turned
out
*NL*
if
they
inform
against
me
.
I
only
have
my
place
to
live
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
too
,
should
be
sorry
enough
to
lose
mine
,
''
answered
the
good
cure
,
*NL*
with
increasing
emotion
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
difference
!
''
answered
the
jailer
keenly
.
``
As
for
you
,
M.
le
*NL*
cure
,
we
all
know
that
you
have
eight
hundred
francs
a
year
,
good
solid
*NL*
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
facts
which
,
commented
upon
and
exaggerated
in
twenty
*NL*
different
ways
,
had
been
agitating
for
the
last
two
days
all
the
odious
*NL*
passions
of
the
little
town
of
Verrieres
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
present
time
they
served
as
the
text
for
the
little
discussion
*NL*
which
M.
de
Renal
was
having
with
his
wife
.
He
had
visited
the
cure
*NL*
earlier
in
the
morning
accompanied
by
M.
Valenod
,
the
director
of
the
*NL*
workhouse
,
in
order
to
convey
their
most
emphatic
displeasure
.
M.
*NL*
Chelan
had
no
protector
,
and
felt
all
the
weight
of
their
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
gentlemen
,
I
shall
be
the
third
cure
of
eighty
years
of
age
who
*NL*
has
been
turned
out
in
this
district
.
I
have
been
here
for
fifty-six
*NL*
years
.
I
have
baptized
nearly
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
,
which
*NL*
was
only
a
hamlet
when
I
came
to
it
.
Every
day
I
marry
young
people
*NL*
whose
grandparents
I
have
married
in
days
gone
by
.
Verrieres
is
my
*NL*
family
,
but
I
said
to
myself
when
I
saw
the
stranger
,
`
This
man
from
*NL*
Paris
may
as
a
matter
of
fact
be
a
Liberal
,
there
are
only
too
many
of
*NL*
them
about
,
but
what
harm
can
he
do
to
our
poor
and
to
our
prisoners
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reproaches
of
M.
de
Renal
,
and
above
all
,
those
of
M.
Valenod
,
the
*NL*
director
of
the
workhouse
,
became
more
and
more
animated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
gentlemen
,
turn
me
out
then
,
''
the
old
cure
exclaimed
in
a
*NL*
trembling
voice
;
``
I
shall
still
continue
to
live
in
the
district
.
As
*NL*
you
know
,
I
inherited
forty-eight
years
ago
a
piece
of
land
that
brings
*NL*
in
eight
hundred
francs
a
year
;
I
shall
live
on
that
income
.
I
do
not
*NL*
save
anything
out
of
my
living
,
gentlemen
;
and
that
is
perhaps
why
,
*NL*
when
you
talk
to
me
about
it
,
I
am
not
particularly
frightened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
always
got
on
very
well
with
his
wife
,
but
he
did
not
know
*NL*
what
to
answer
when
she
timidly
repeated
the
phrase
of
M.
le
cure
,
*NL*
``
What
harm
can
this
Paris
gentleman
do
the
prisoners
?
''
He
was
on
the
*NL*
point
of
quite
losing
his
temper
when
she
gave
a
cry
.
Her
second
son
*NL*
had
mounted
the
parapet
of
the
terrace
wall
and
was
running
along
it
,
*NL*
although
the
wall
was
raised
to
a
height
of
more
than
twenty
feet
above
*NL*
the
vineyard
on
the
other
side
.
The
fear
of
frightening
her
son
and
*NL*
making
him
fall
prevented
Madame
de
Renal
speaking
to
him
.
But
at
last
*NL*
the
child
,
who
was
smiling
at
his
own
pluck
,
looked
at
his
mother
,
saw
*NL*
her
pallor
,
jumped
down
on
to
the
walk
and
ran
to
her
.
He
was
well
*NL*
scolded
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
event
changed
the
course
of
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
mean
to
take
Sorel
,
the
son
of
the
sawyer
,
into
the
house
,
''
*NL*
said
M.
de
Renal
;
``
he
will
look
after
the
children
,
who
are
getting
too
*NL*
naughty
for
us
to
manage
.
He
is
a
young
priest
,
or
as
good
as
one
,
a
*NL*
good
Latin
scholar
,
and
will
make
the
children
get
on
.
According
to
the
*NL*
cure
,
he
has
a
steady
character
.
I
will
give
him
three
hundred
francs
a
*NL*
year
and
his
board
.
I
have
some
doubts
as
to
his
morality
,
for
he
used
*NL*
to
be
the
favourite
of
that
old
Surgeon-Major
,
Member
of
the
Legion
of
*NL*
Honour
,
who
went
to
board
with
the
Sorels
,
on
the
pretext
that
he
was
*NL*
their
cousin
.
It
is
quite
possible
that
that
man
was
really
simply
a
*NL*
secret
agent
of
the
Liberals
.
He
said
that
the
mountain
air
did
his
*NL*
asthma
good
,
but
that
is
something
which
has
never
been
proved
.
He
*NL*
has
gone
through
all
_
Buonaparte
's
_
campaigns
in
Italy
,
and
had
even
,
*NL*
it
was
said
,
voted
against
the
Empire
in
the
plebiscite
.
This
Liberal
*NL*
taught
the
Sorel
boy
Latin
,
and
left
him
a
number
of
books
which
he
had
*NL*
brought
with
him
.
Of
course
,
in
the
ordinary
way
,
I
should
have
never
*NL*
thought
of
allowing
a
carpenter
's
son
to
come
into
contact
with
our
*NL*
children
,
but
the
cure
told
me
,
the
very
day
before
the
scene
which
*NL*
has
just
estranged
us
for
ever
,
that
Sorel
has
been
studying
theology
*NL*
for
three
years
with
the
intention
of
entering
a
seminary
.
He
is
,
*NL*
consequently
,
not
a
Liberal
,
and
he
certainly
is
a
good
Latin
scholar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
arrangement
will
be
convenient
in
more
than
one
way
,
''
continued
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
,
looking
at
his
wife
with
a
diplomatic
air
.
``
That
Valenod
*NL*
is
proud
enough
of
his
two
fine
Norman
horses
which
he
has
just
bought
*NL*
for
his
carriage
,
but
he
has
n't
a
tutor
for
his
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
might
take
this
one
away
from
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
approve
of
my
plan
,
then
?
''
said
M.
de
Renal
,
thanking
his
wife
*NL*
with
a
smile
for
the
excellent
idea
which
she
had
just
had
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
that
's
settled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
,
my
dear
,
how
quickly
you
make
up
your
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
because
I
'm
a
man
of
character
,
as
the
cure
found
out
right
*NL*
enough
.
Do
n't
let
us
deceive
ourselves
;
we
are
surrounded
by
Liberals
*NL*
in
this
place
.
All
those
cloth
merchants
are
jealous
of
me
,
I
am
*NL*
certain
of
it
;
two
or
three
are
becoming
rich
men
.
Well
,
I
should
*NL*
rather
fancy
it
for
them
to
see
M.
de
Renal
's
children
pass
along
the
*NL*
street
as
they
go
out
for
their
walk
,
escorted
by
_
their
tutor
_
.
It
*NL*
will
impress
people
.
My
grandfather
often
used
to
tell
us
that
he
had
*NL*
a
tutor
when
he
was
young
.
It
may
run
me
into
a
hundred
crowns
,
but
*NL*
that
ought
to
be
looked
upon
as
an
expense
necessary
for
keeping
up
our
*NL*
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
sudden
resolution
left
Madame
de
Renal
quite
pensive
.
She
was
*NL*
a
big
,
well-made
woman
,
who
had
been
the
beauty
of
the
country
,
to
*NL*
use
the
local
expression
.
She
had
a
certain
air
of
simplicity
and
*NL*
youthfulness
in
her
deportment
.
This
naive
grace
,
with
its
innocence
*NL*
and
its
vivacity
,
might
even
have
recalled
to
a
Parisian
some
*NL*
suggestion
of
the
sweets
he
had
left
behind
him
.
If
she
had
realised
*NL*
this
particular
phase
of
her
success
,
Madame
de
Renal
would
have
been
*NL*
quite
ashamed
of
it
.
All
coquetry
,
all
affectation
,
were
absolutely
*NL*
alien
to
her
temperament
.
M.
Valenod
,
the
rich
director
of
the
*NL*
workhouse
,
had
the
reputation
of
having
paid
her
court
,
a
fact
which
*NL*
had
cast
a
singular
glamour
over
her
virtue
;
for
this
M.
Valenod
,
a
*NL*
big
young
man
with
a
square
,
sturdy
frame
,
florid
face
,
and
big
,
black
*NL*
whiskers
,
was
one
of
those
coarse
,
blustering
,
and
noisy
people
who
*NL*
pass
in
the
provinces
for
a
``
fine
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
,
who
had
a
very
shy
,
and
apparently
a
very
uneven
*NL*
temperament
,
was
particularly
shocked
by
M.
Valenod
's
lack
of
repose
,
*NL*
and
by
his
boisterous
loudness
.
Her
aloofness
from
what
,
in
the
*NL*
Verrieres
'
jargon
,
was
called
``
having
a
good
time
,
''
had
earned
her
the
*NL*
reputation
of
being
very
proud
of
her
birth
.
In
fact
,
she
never
thought
*NL*
about
it
,
but
she
had
been
extremely
glad
to
find
the
inhabitants
of
*NL*
the
town
visit
her
less
frequently
.
We
shall
not
deny
that
she
passed
*NL*
for
a
fool
in
the
eyes
of
_
their
_
good
ladies
because
she
did
not
*NL*
wheedle
her
husband
,
and
allowed
herself
to
miss
the
most
splendid
*NL*
opportunities
of
getting
fine
hats
from
Paris
or
Besancon
.
Provided
she
*NL*
was
allowed
to
wander
in
her
beautiful
garden
,
she
never
complained
.
*NL*
She
was
a
naive
soul
,
who
had
never
educated
herself
up
to
the
point
*NL*
of
judging
her
husband
and
confessing
to
herself
that
he
bored
her
.
*NL*
She
supposed
,
without
actually
formulating
the
thought
,
that
there
was
*NL*
no
greater
sweetness
in
the
relationship
between
husband
and
wife
than
*NL*
she
herself
had
experienced
.
She
loved
M.
de
Renal
most
when
he
talked
*NL*
about
his
projects
for
their
children
.
The
elder
he
had
destined
for
*NL*
the
army
,
the
second
for
the
law
,
and
the
third
for
the
Church
.
To
sum
*NL*
up
,
she
found
M.
de
Renal
much
less
boring
than
all
the
other
men
of
*NL*
her
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
conjugal
opinion
was
quite
sound
.
The
Mayor
of
Verrieres
had
a
*NL*
reputation
for
wit
,
and
above
all
,
a
reputation
for
good
form
,
on
*NL*
the
strength
of
half-a-dozen
``
chestnuts
''
which
he
had
inherited
from
*NL*
an
uncle
.
Old
Captain
de
Renal
had
served
,
before
the
Revolution
,
in
*NL*
the
infantry
regiment
of
M.
the
Duke
of
Orleans
,
and
was
admitted
*NL*
to
the
Prince
's
salons
when
he
went
to
Paris
.
He
had
seen
Madame
de
*NL*
Montesson
,
the
famous
Madame
de
Genlis
,
M.
Ducret
,
the
inventor
,
of
the
*NL*
Palais-Royal
.
These
personages
would
crop
up
only
too
frequently
in
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
's
anecdotes
.
He
found
it
,
however
,
more
and
more
of
a
strain
*NL*
to
remember
stories
which
required
such
delicacy
in
the
telling
,
and
*NL*
for
some
time
past
it
had
only
been
on
great
occasions
that
he
would
*NL*
trot
out
his
anecdotes
concerning
the
House
of
Orleans
.
As
,
moreover
,
*NL*
he
was
extremely
polite
,
except
on
money
matters
,
he
passed
,
and
justly
*NL*
so
,
for
the
most
aristocratic
personage
in
Verrieres
.

``
My

said
the
mayor
of

Verrieres
at
six
o'clock
the
following
morning
,
as
he
went
down
to
the
*NL*
saw-mill
of
Father
Sorel
.
``
It
had
never
occurred

me

say
,
knows
Latin
like

that
*NL*
restless
spirit
,
the
director
of
the
workhouse
,
might
have
the
same
*NL*
idea
and
snatch
him
away
from
me
,
though
of
course
I
told
her
that
it
*NL*
had
,
in
order
to
preserve
my
proper
superiority
.
And
how
smugly
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
would
he
talk
about
his
children
's
tutor
!
...
The
question
is
,
*NL*
once
the
tutor
's
mine
,
shall
he
wear

cassock

''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
was
absorbed
in
this
problem
when
he
saw
a
peasant
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
a
man
nearly
six
feet
tall
,
who
since
dawn
had
apparently
*NL*
been
occupied
in
measuring
some
pieces
of
wood
which
had
been
put
*NL*
down
alongside
the
Doubs
on
the
towing-path
.
The
peasant
did
not
look
*NL*
particularly
pleased
when
he
saw
M.
the
Mayor
approach
,
as
these
pieces
*NL*
of
wood
obstructed
the
road
,
and
had
been
placed
there
in
breach
of
the
*NL*
rules
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Sorel
-LRB-
for
it
was
he
-RRB-
was
very
surprised
,
and
even
more
pleased
*NL*
at
the
singular
offer
which
M.
de
Renal
made
him
for
his
son
Julien
.
*NL*
None
the
less
,
he
listened
to
it
with
that
air
of
sulky
discontent
and
*NL*
apathy
which
the
subtle
inhabitants
of
these
mountains
know
so
well
*NL*
how
to
assume
.
Slaves
as
they
have
been
since
the
time
of
the
Spanish
*NL*
Conquest
,
they
still
preserve
this
feature
,
which
is
also
found
in
the
*NL*
character
of
the
Egyptian
fellah
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sorel
's
answer
was
at
first
simply
a
long-winded
recitation
of
*NL*
all
the
formulas
of
respect
which
he
knew
by
heart
.
While
he
was
*NL*
repeating
these
empty
words
with
an
uneasy
smile
,
which
accentuated
*NL*
all
the
natural
disingenuousness
,
if
not
,
indeed
,
knavishness
of
his
*NL*
physiognomy
,
the
active
mind
of
the
old
peasant
tried
to
discover
what
*NL*
reason
could
induce
so
important
a
man
to
take
into
his
house
his
*NL*
good-for-nothing
of
a
son
.
He
was
very
dissatisfied
with
Julien
,
and
*NL*
it
was
for
Julien
that
M.
de
Renal
offered
the
undreamt-of
salary
of
*NL*
300
fcs
.
a
year
,
with
board
and
even
clothing
.
This
latter
claim
,
which
*NL*
Father
Sorel
had
had
the
genius
to
spring
upon
the
mayor
,
had
been
*NL*
granted
with
equal
suddenness
by
M.
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
demand
made
an
impression
on
the
mayor
.
It
is
clear
,
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
that
since
Sorel
is
not
beside
himself
with
delight
over
my
*NL*
proposal
,
as
in
the
ordinary
way
he
ought
to
be
,
he
must
have
had
*NL*
offers
made
to
him
elsewhere
,
and
whom
could
they
have
come
from
,
if
*NL*
not
from
Valenod
.
It
was
in
vain
that
M.
de
Renal
pressed
Sorel
to
*NL*
clinch
the
matter
then
and
there
.
The
old
peasant
,
astute
man
that
*NL*
he
was
,
stubbornly
refused
to
do
so
.
He
wanted
,
he
said
,
to
consult
*NL*
his
son
,
as
if
in
the
provinces
,
forsooth
,
a
rich
father
consulted
a
*NL*
penniless
son
for
any
other
reason
than
as
a
mere
matter
of
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
water
saw-mill
consists
of
a
shed
by
the
side
of
a
stream
.
The
roof
*NL*
is
supported
by
a
framework
resting
on
four
large
timber
pillars
.
A
*NL*
saw
can
be
seen
going
up
and
down
at
a
height
of
eight
to
ten
feet
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
shed
,
while
a
piece
of
wood
is
propelled
against
*NL*
this
saw
by
a
very
simple
mechanism
.
It
is
a
wheel
whose
motive-power
*NL*
is
supplied
by
the
stream
,
which
sets
in
motion
this
double
piece
of
*NL*
mechanism
,
the
mechanism
of
the
saw
which
goes
up
and
down
,
and
the
*NL*
mechanism
which
gently
pushes
the
piece
of
wood
towards
the
saw
,
which
*NL*
cuts
it
up
into
planks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Approaching
his
workshop
,
Father
Sorel
called
Julien
in
his
stentorian
*NL*
voice
;
nobody
answered
.
He
only
saw
his
giant
elder
sons
,
who
,
armed
*NL*
with
heavy
axes
,
were
cutting
up
the
pine
planks
which
they
had
to
*NL*
carry
to
the
saw
.
They
were
engrossed
in
following
exactly
the
black
*NL*
mark
traced
on
each
piece
of
wood
,
from
which
every
blow
of
their
axes
*NL*
threw
off
enormous
shavings
.
They
did
not
hear
their
father
's
voice
.
*NL*
The
latter
made
his
way
towards
the
shed
.
He
entered
it
and
looked
in
*NL*
vain
for
Julien
in
the
place
where
he
ought
to
have
been
by
the
side
of
*NL*
the
saw
.
He
saw
him
five
or
six
feet
higher
up
,
sitting
astride
one
of
*NL*
the
rafters
of
the
roof
.
Instead
of
watching
attentively
the
action
of
*NL*
the
machinery
,
Julien
was
reading
.
Nothing
was
more
anti-pathetic
to
*NL*
old
Sorel
.
He
might
possibly
have
forgiven
Julien
his
puny
physique
,
*NL*
ill
adapted
as
it
was
to
manual
labour
,
and
different
as
it
was
from
*NL*
that
of
his
elder
brothers
;
but
he
hated
this
reading
mania
.
He
could
*NL*
not
read
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
he
called
Julien
two
or
three
times
.
It
was
the
*NL*
young
man
's
concentration
on
his
book
,
rather
than
the
din
made
by
the
*NL*
saw
,
which
prevented
him
from
hearing
his
father
's
terrible
voice
.
At
*NL*
last
the
latter
,
in
spite
of
his
age
,
jumped
nimbly
on
to
the
tree
*NL*
that
was
undergoing
the
action
of
the
saw
,
and
from
there
on
to
the
*NL*
cross-bar
that
supported
the
roof
.
A
violent
blow
made
the
book
which
*NL*
Julien
held
,
go
flying
into
the
stream
;
a
second
blow
on
the
head
,
*NL*
equally
violent
,
which
took
the
form
of
a
box
on
the
ears
,
made
him
*NL*
lose
his
balance
.
He
was
on
the
point
of
falling
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
*NL*
lower
down
into
the
middle
of
the
levers
of
the
running
machinery
which
*NL*
would
have
cut
him
to
pieces
,
but
his
father
caught
him
as
he
fell
,
in
*NL*
his
left
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
it
,
is
it
,
lazy
bones
!
always
going
to
read
your
damned
*NL*
books
are
you
,
when
you
're
keeping
watch
on
the
saw
?
You
read
them
in
*NL*
the
evening
if
you
want
to
,
when
you
go
to
play
the
fool
at
the
cure
's
,
*NL*
that
's
the
proper
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
stunned
by
the
force
of
the
blow
and
bleeding
profusely
,
*NL*
Julien
went
back
to
his
official
post
by
the
side
of
the
saw
.
He
had
*NL*
tears
in
his
eyes
,
less
by
reason
of
the
physical
pain
than
on
account
*NL*
of
the
loss
of
his
beloved
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
down
,
you
beast
,
when
I
am
talking
to
you
,
''
the
noise
of
the
*NL*
machinery
prevented
Julien
from
hearing
this
order
.
His
father
,
who
had
*NL*
gone
down
did
not
wish
to
give
himself
the
trouble
of
climbing
up
on
to
*NL*
the
machinery
again
,
and
went
to
fetch
a
long
fork
used
for
bringing
*NL*
down
nuts
,
with
which
he
struck
him
on
the
shoulder
.
Julien
had
*NL*
scarcely
reached
the
ground
,
when
old
Sorel
chased
him
roughly
in
front
*NL*
of
him
and
pushed
him
roughly
towards
the
house
.
``
God
knows
what
he
is
*NL*
going
to
do
with
me
,
''
said
the
young
man
to
himself
.
As
he
passed
,
he
*NL*
looked
sorrowfully
into
the
stream
into
which
his
book
had
fallen
,
it
*NL*
was
the
one
that
he
held
dearest
of
all
,
the
_
Memorial
of
St.
Helena
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
purple
cheeks
and
downcast
eyes
.
He
was
a
young
man
of
eighteen
*NL*
to
nineteen
years
old
,
and
of
puny
appearance
,
with
irregular
but
*NL*
delicate
features
,
and
an
aquiline
nose
.
The
big
black
eyes
which
*NL*
betokened
in
their
tranquil
moments
a
temperament
at
once
fiery
and
*NL*
reflective
were
at
the
present
moment
animated
by
an
expression
of
*NL*
the
most
ferocious
hate
.
Dark
chestnut
hair
,
which
came
low
down
over
*NL*
his
brow
,
made
his
forehead
appear
small
and
gave
him
a
sinister
look
*NL*
during
his
angry
moods
.
It
is
doubtful
if
any
face
out
of
all
the
*NL*
innumerable
varieties
of
the
human
physiognomy
was
ever
distinguished
*NL*
by
a
more
arresting
individuality
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
supple
well-knit
figure
,
indicated
agility
rather
than
strength
.
His
*NL*
air
of
extreme
pensiveness
and
his
great
pallor
had
given
his
father
*NL*
the
idea
that
he
would
not
live
,
or
that
if
he
did
,
it
would
only
be
to
*NL*
be
a
burden
to
his
family
.
The
butt
of
the
whole
house
,
he
hated
his
*NL*
brothers
and
his
father
.
He
was
regularly
beaten
in
the
Sunday
sports
*NL*
in
the
public
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
less
than
a
year
ago
his
pretty
face
had
begun
to
win
him
some
*NL*
sympathy
among
the
young
girls
.
Universally
despised
as
a
weakling
,
*NL*
Julien
had
adored
that
old
Surgeon-Major
,
who
had
one
day
dared
to
talk
*NL*
to
the
mayor
on
the
subject
of
the
plane
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Surgeon
had
sometimes
paid
Father
Sorel
for
taking
his
son
for
*NL*
a
day
,
and
had
taught
him
Latin
and
History
,
that
is
to
say
the
1796
*NL*
Campaign
in
Italy
which
was
all
the
history
he
knew
.
When
he
died
,
he
*NL*
had
bequeathed
his
Cross
of
the
Legion
of
Honour
,
his
arrears
of
half
*NL*
pay
,
and
thirty
or
forty
volumes
,
of
which
the
most
precious
had
just
*NL*
fallen
into
the
public
stream
,
which
had
been
diverted
owing
to
the
*NL*
influence
of
M.
the
Mayor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
had
he
entered
the
house
,
when
Julien
felt
his
shoulder
*NL*
gripped
by
his
father
's
powerful
hand
;
he
trembled
,
expecting
some
*NL*
blows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Answer
me
without
lying
,
''
cried
the
harsh
voice
of
the
old
peasant
in
*NL*
his
ears
,
while
his
hand
turned
him
round
and
round
,
like
a
child
's
*NL*
hand
turns
round
a
lead
soldier
.
The
big
black
eyes
of
Julien
filled
*NL*
with
tears
,
and
were
confronted
by
the
small
grey
eyes
of
the
old
*NL*
carpenter
,
who
looked
as
if
he
meant
to
read
to
the
very
bottom
of
his
*NL*
soul
.

with

a

well
suited

so
he
thought

to
keep
off

*NL*
*NL*
``

answered
*NL*
the
cunning
peasant

He
was
then
silent
for
a
moment
.
``
But
I
shall
*NL*
never
get
anything
out
of
you

you
damned

he
went
on

``

*NL*
``
What
shall

get
for

*NL*
``

a
servant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
with
whom
shall
I
have
my
meals
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
discomforted
old
Sorel
,
who
felt
he
might
possibly
commit
*NL*
some
imprudence
if
he
went
on
talking
.
He
burst
out
against
Julien
,
*NL*
flung
insult
after
insult
at
him
,
accused
him
of
gluttony
,
and
left
him
*NL*
to
go
and
consult
his
other
sons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
saw
them
afterwards
,
each
one
leaning
on
his
axe
and
holding
*NL*
counsel
.
Having
looked
at
them
for
a
long
time
,
Julien
saw
that
he
*NL*
could
find
out
nothing
,
and
went
and
stationed
himself
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
saw
in
order
to
avoid
being
surprised
.
He
wanted
to
think
*NL*
over
this
unexpected
piece
of
news
,
which
changed
his
whole
life
,
*NL*
but
he
felt
himself
unable
to
consider
the
matter
prudently
,
his
*NL*
imagination
being
concentrated
in
wondering
what
he
would
see
in
M.
de
*NL*
Renal
's
fine
mansion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
give
all
that
up
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
rather
than
let
myself
*NL*
be
reduced
to
eating
with
the
servants
.
My
father
would
like
to
force
*NL*
me
to
it
.
I
would
rather
die
.
I
have
fifteen
francs
and
eight
sous
of
*NL*
savings
.
I
will
run
away
to-night
;
I
will
go
across
country
by
paths
*NL*
where
there
are
no
gendarmes
to
be
feared
,
and
in
two
days
I
shall
be
*NL*
at
Besancon
.
I
will
enlist
as
a
soldier
there
,
and
,
if
necessary
,
I
*NL*
will
cross
into
Switzerland
.
But
in
that
case
,
no
more
advancement
,
it
*NL*
will
be
all
up
with
my
being
a
priest
,
that
fine
career
which
may
lead
*NL*
to
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
abhorrence
of
eating
with
the
servants
was
not
really
natural
to
*NL*
Julien
;
he
would
have
done
things
quite
,
if
not
more
,
disagreeable
in
*NL*
order
to
get
on
.
He
derived
this
repugnance
from
the
_
Confessions
_
*NL*
of
Rousseau
.
It
was
the
only
book
by
whose
help
his
imagination
*NL*
endeavoured
to
construct
the
world
.
The
collection
of
the
Bulletins
of
*NL*
the
Grand
Army
,
and
the
_
Memorial
of
St.
Helena
_
completed
his
Koran
.
*NL*
He
would
have
died
for
these
three
works
.
He
never
believed
in
any
*NL*
other
.
To
use
a
phrase
of
the
old
Surgeon-Major
,
he
regarded
all
the
*NL*
other
books
in
the
world
as
packs
of
lies
,
written
by
rogues
in
order
*NL*
to
get
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
possessed
both
a
fiery
soul
and
one
of
those
astonishing
*NL*
memories
which
are
so
often
combined
with
stupidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
win
over
the
old
cure
Chelan
,
on
whose
good
grace
he
*NL*
realized
that
his
future
prospects
depended
,
he
had
learnt
by
heart
the
*NL*
New
Testament
in
Latin
.
He
also
knew
M.
de
Maistre
's
book
on
The
Pope
,
*NL*
and
believed
in
one
as
little
as
he
did
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sorel
and
his
son
avoided
talking
to
each
other
to-day
as
though
by
*NL*
mutual
consent
.
In
the
evening
Julien
went
to
take
his
theology
lesson
*NL*
at
the
cure
's
,
but
he
did
not
consider
that
it
was
prudent
to
say
*NL*
anything
to
him
about
the
strange
proposal
which
had
been
made
to
his
*NL*
father
.
``
It
is
possibly
a
trap
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
must
pretend
*NL*
that
I
have
forgotten
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Early
next
morning
,
M.
de
Renal
had
old
Sorel
summoned
to
him
.
*NL*
He
eventually
arrived
,
after
keeping
M.
de
Renal
waiting
for
an
*NL*
hour-and-a-half
,
and
made
,
as
he
entered
the
room
,
a
hundred
apologies
*NL*
interspersed
with
as
many
bows
.
After
having
run
the
gauntlet
of
all
*NL*
kinds
of
objections
,
Sorel
was
given
to
understand
that
his
son
would
*NL*
have
his
meals
with
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
,
and
that
*NL*
he
would
eat
alone
in
a
room
with
the
children
on
the
days
when
they
*NL*
had
company
.
The
more
clearly
Sorel
realized
the
genuine
eagerness
of
*NL*
M.
the
Mayor
,
the
more
difficulties
he
felt
inclined
to
raise
.
Being
*NL*
moreover
full
of
mistrust
and
astonishment
,
he
asked
to
see
the
room
*NL*
where
his
son
would
sleep
.
It
was
a
big
room
,
quite
decently
furnished
,
*NL*
into
which
the
servants
were
already
engaged
in
carrying
the
beds
of
*NL*
the
three
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
circumstance
explained
a
lot
to
the
old
peasant
.
He
asked
*NL*
immediately
,
with
quite
an
air
of
assurance
,
to
see
the
suit
which
*NL*
would
be
given
to
his
son
.
M.
de
Renal
opened
his
desk
and
took
out
one
*NL*
hundred
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
son
will
go
to
M.
Durand
,
the
draper
,
with
this
money
and
will
*NL*
get
a
complete
black
suit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
even
supposing
I
take
him
away
from
you
,
''
said
the
peasant
,
who
*NL*
had
suddenly
forgotten
all
his
respectful
formalities
,
``
will
he
still
*NL*
keep
this
black
suit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Sorel
,
in
a
drawling
voice
,
``
all
that
remains
to
do
is
to
*NL*
agree
on
just
one
thing
,
the
money
which
you
will
give
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
exclaimed
M.
de
Renal
,
indignantly
,
``
we
agreed
on
that
*NL*
yesterday
.
I
shall
give
him
three
hundred
francs
,
I
think
that
is
a
*NL*
lot
,
and
probably
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
your
offer
and
I
do
not
deny
it
,
''
said
old
Sorel
,
speaking
*NL*
still
very
slowly
;
and
by
a
stroke
of
genius
which
will
only
astonish
*NL*
those
who
do
not
know
the
Franche-Comte
peasants
,
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
and
added
,
``
We
shall
get
better
terms
elsewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mayor
's
face
exhibited
the
utmost
consternation
at
these
words
.
He
*NL*
pulled
himself
together
however
and
after
a
cunning
conversation
of
*NL*
two
hours
'
length
,
where
every
single
word
on
both
sides
was
carefully
*NL*
weighed
,
the
subtlety
of
the
peasant
scored
a
victory
over
the
subtlety
*NL*
of
the
rich
man
,
whose
livelihood
was
not
so
dependent
on
his
faculty
*NL*
of
cunning
.
All
the
numerous
stipulations
which
were
to
regulate
*NL*
Julien
's
new
existence
were
duly
formulated
.
Not
only
was
his
salary
*NL*
fixed
at
four
hundred
francs
,
but
they
were
to
be
paid
in
advance
on
*NL*
the
first
of
each
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
I
will
give
him
thirty-five
francs
,
''
said
M.
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
sure
,
''
said
the
peasant
,
in
a
fawning
voice
,
``
that
a
rich
,
*NL*
generous
man
like
the
M.
mayor
would
go
as
far
as
thirty-six
francs
,
to
*NL*
make
up
a
good
round
sum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agreed
!
''
said
M.
de
Renal
,
``
but
let
this
be
final
.
''
For
the
moment
his
*NL*
temper
gave
him
a
tone
of
genuine
firmness
.
The
peasant
saw
that
it
*NL*
would
not
do
to
go
any
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
on
his
side
,
M.
de
Renal
managed
to
score
.
He
absolutely
refused
*NL*
to
give
old
Sorel
,
who
was
very
anxious
to
receive
it
on
behalf
of
his
*NL*
son
,
the
thirty-six
francs
for
the
first
month
.
It
had
occurred
to
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
that
he
would
have
to
tell
his
wife
the
figure
which
he
had
*NL*
cut
throughout
these
negotiations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hand
me
back
the
hundred
francs
which
I
gave
you
,
''
he
said
sharply
.
*NL*
``
M.
Durand
owes
me
something
,
I
will
go
with
your
son
to
see
about
a
*NL*
black
cloth
suit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
manifestation
of
firmness
,
Sorel
had
the
prudence
to
return
*NL*
to
his
respectful
formulas
;
they
took
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
Finally
,
seeing
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
gained
,
he
took
his
*NL*
leave
.
He
finished
his
last
bow
with
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
send
my
son
to
the
Chateau
.
''
The
Mayor
's
officials
called
his
*NL*
house
by
this
designation
when
they
wanted
to
humour
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
got
back
to
his
workshop
,
it
was
in
vain
that
Sorel
sought
his
*NL*
son
.
Suspicious
of
what
might
happen
,
Julien
had
gone
out
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
night
.
He
wished
to
place
his
Cross
of
the
Legion
of
Honour
and
*NL*
his
books
in
a
place
of
safety
.
He
had
taken
everything
to
a
young
*NL*
wood-merchant
named
Fouque
,
who
was
a
friend
of
his
,
and
who
lived
in
*NL*
the
high
mountain
which
commands
Verrieres
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows
,
you
damned
lazy
bones
,
''
said
his
father
to
him
when
he
*NL*
re-appeared
,
``
if
you
will
ever
be
sufficiently
honourable
to
pay
me
*NL*
back
the
price
of
your
board
which
I
have
been
advancing
to
you
for
so
*NL*
many
years
.
Take
your
rags
and
clear
out
to
M.
the
Mayor
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
astonished
at
not
being
beaten
and
hastened
to
leave
.
He
*NL*
had
scarcely
got
out
of
sight
of
his
terrible
father
when
he
slackened
*NL*
his
pace
.
He
considered
that
it
would
assist
the
role
played
by
his
*NL*
hypocrisy
to
go
and
say
a
prayer
in
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
hypocrisy
surprises
you
?
The
soul
of
the
peasant
had
had
to
go
*NL*
through
a
great
deal
before
arriving
at
this
horrible
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
seen
in
the
days
of
his
early
childhood
certain
Dragoons
*NL*
of
the
6th
-LSB-
1
-RSB-
with
long
white
cloaks
and
hats
covered
with
long
black
*NL*
plumed
helmets
who
were
returning
from
Italy
,
and
tied
up
their
horses
*NL*
to
the
grilled
window
of
his
father
's
house
.
The
sight
had
made
him
mad
*NL*
on
the
military
profession
.
Later
on
he
had
listened
with
ecstasy
to
*NL*
the
narrations
of
the
battles
of
Lodi
,
Arcola
and
Rivoli
with
which
the
*NL*
old
surgeon-major
had
regaled
him
.
He
observed
the
ardent
gaze
which
*NL*
the
old
man
used
to
direct
towards
his
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Julien
was
fourteen
years
of
age
they
commenced
to
build
a
*NL*
church
at
Verrieres
which
,
in
view
of
the
smallness
of
the
town
,
has
*NL*
some
claim
to
be
called
magnificent
.
There
were
four
marble
columns
in
*NL*
particular
,
the
sight
of
which
impressed
Julien
.
They
became
celebrated
*NL*
in
the
district
owing
to
the
mortal
hate
which
they
raised
between
*NL*
the
Justice
of
the
Peace
and
the
young
vicar
who
had
been
sent
from
*NL*
Besancon
and
who
passed
for
a
spy
of
the
congregation
.
The
Justice
of
*NL*
the
Peace
was
on
the
point
of
losing
his
place
,
so
said
the
public
*NL*
opinion
at
any
rate
.
Had
he
not
dared
to
have
a
difference
with
the
*NL*
priest
who
went
every
fortnight
to
Besancon
;
where
he
saw
,
so
they
*NL*
said
,
my
Lord
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
the
Justice
of
the
Peace
,
who
was
the
father
of
a
*NL*
numerous
family
,
gave
several
sentences
which
seemed
unjust
:
all
these
*NL*
sentences
were
inflicted
on
those
of
the
inhabitants
who
read
the
*NL*
''
_
Constitutionnel
_
.
''
The
right
party
triumphed
.
It
is
true
it
was
only
a
*NL*
question
of
sums
of
three
or
five
francs
,
but
one
of
these
little
fines
*NL*
had
to
be
paid
by
a
nail-maker
,
who
was
god-father
to
Julien
.
This
man
*NL*
exclaimed
in
his
anger
``
What
a
change
!
and
to
think
that
for
more
than
*NL*
twenty
years
the
Justice
of
the
Peace
has
passed
for
an
honest
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Surgeon-Major
,
Julien
's
friend
,
died
.
Suddenly
Julien
left
off
*NL*
talking
about
Napoleon
.
He
announced
his
intention
of
becoming
a
*NL*
priest
,
and
was
always
to
be
seen
in
his
father
's
workshop
occupied
*NL*
in
learning
by
heart
the
Latin
Bible
which
the
cure
had
lent
him
.
The
*NL*
good
old
man
was
astonished
at
his
progress
,
and
passed
whole
evenings
*NL*
in
teaching
him
theology
.
In
his
society
Julien
did
not
manifest
other
*NL*
than
pious
sentiments
.
Who
could
not
possibly
guess
that
beneath
this
*NL*
girlish
face
,
so
pale
and
so
sweet
,
lurked
the
unbreakable
resolution
*NL*
to
risk
a
thousand
deaths
rather
than
fail
to
make
his
fortune
.
Making
*NL*
his
fortune
primarily
meant
to
Julien
getting
out
of
Verrieres
:
he
*NL*
abhorred
his
native
country
;
everything
that
he
saw
there
froze
his
*NL*
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
had
moments
of
exultation
since
his
earliest
childhood
.
He
would
*NL*
then
dream
with
gusto
of
being
presented
one
day
to
the
pretty
women
*NL*
of
Paris
.
He
would
manage
to
attract
their
attention
by
some
dazzling
*NL*
feat
:
why
should
he
not
be
loved
by
one
of
them
just
as
Buonaparte
,
*NL*
when
still
poor
,
had
been
loved
by
the
brilliant
Madame
de
Beauharnais
.
*NL*
For
many
years
past
Julien
had
scarcely
passed
a
single
year
of
his
*NL*
life
without
reminding
himself
that
Buonaparte
,
the
obscure
and
*NL*
penniless
lieutenant
,
had
made
himself
master
of
the
whole
world
by
the
*NL*
power
of
his
sword
.
This
idea
consoled
him
for
his
misfortune
,
which
*NL*
he
considered
to
be
great
,
and
rendered
such
joyful
moments
as
he
had
*NL*
doubly
intense
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
building
of
the
church
and
the
sentences
pronounced
by
the
Justice
*NL*
of
the
Peace
suddenly
enlightened
him
.
An
idea
came
to
him
which
made
*NL*
him
almost
mad
for
some
weeks
,
and
finally
took
complete
possession
of
*NL*
him
with
all
the
magic
that
a
first
idea
possesses
for
a
passionate
*NL*
soul
which
believes
that
it
is
original
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
time
when
Buonaparte
got
himself
talked
about
,
France
was
*NL*
frightened
of
being
invaded
;
military
distinction
was
necessary
and
*NL*
fashionable
.
Nowadays
,
one
sees
priests
of
forty
with
salaries
of
*NL*
100,000
francs
,
that
is
to
say
,
three
times
as
much
as
Napoleon
's
*NL*
famous
generals
of
a
division
.
They
need
persons
to
assist
them
.
Look
*NL*
at
that
Justice
of
the
Peace
,
such
a
good
sort
and
such
an
honest
man
*NL*
up
to
the
present
and
so
old
too
;
he
sacrifices
his
honour
through
the
*NL*
fear
of
incurring
the
displeasure
of
a
young
vicar
of
thirty
.
I
must
be
*NL*
a
priest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
occasion
,
in
the
middle
of
his
new-found
piety
-LRB-
he
had
already
*NL*
been
studying
theology
for
two
years
-RRB-
,
he
was
betrayed
by
a
sudden
*NL*
burst
of
fire
which
consumed
his
soul
.
It
was
at
M.
Chelan
's
.
The
*NL*
good
cure
had
invited
him
to
a
dinner
of
priests
,
and
he
actually
let
*NL*
himself
praise
Napoleon
with
enthusiasm
.
He
bound
his
right
arm
over
*NL*
his
breast
,
pretending
that
he
had
dislocated
it
in
moving
a
trunk
of
a
*NL*
pine-tree
and
carried
it
for
two
months
in
that
painful
position
.
After
*NL*
this
painful
penance
,
he
forgave
himself
.
This
is
the
young
man
of
*NL*
eighteen
with
a
puny
physique
,
and
scarcely
looking
more
than
seventeen
*NL*
at
the
outside
,
who
entered
the
magnificent
church
of
Verrieres
*NL*
carrying
a
little
parcel
under
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
it
gloomy
and
deserted
.
All
the
transepts
in
the
building
had
*NL*
been
covered
with
crimson
cloth
in
celebration
of
a
feast
.
The
result
*NL*
was
that
the
sun
's
rays
produced
an
effect
of
dazzling
light
of
the
*NL*
most
impressive
and
religious
character
.
Julien
shuddered
.
Finding
*NL*
himself
alone
in
the
church
,
he
established
himself
in
the
pew
which
*NL*
had
the
most
magnificent
appearance
.
It
bore
the
arms
of
M.
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
noticed
a
piece
of
printed
paper
spread
out
on
the
stool
,
which
*NL*
was
apparently
intended
to
be
read
,
he
cast
his
eyes
over
it
and
*NL*
saw
:
--
''
_
Details
of
the
execution
and
the
last
moments
of
Louis
Jenrel
,
*NL*
executed
at
Besancon
the
...
_
''
The
paper
was
torn
.
The
two
first
words
*NL*
of
a
line
were
legible
on
the
back
,
they
were
,
''
_

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
could
have
put
this
paper
there
?
''
said
Julien
.
``
Poor
fellow
!
''
he
*NL*
added
with
a
sigh
,
``
the
last
syllable
of
his
name
is
the
same
as
mine
,
''
*NL*
and
he
crumpled
up
the
paper
.
As
he
left
,
Julien
thought
he
saw
blood
*NL*
near
the
Host
,
it
was
holy
water
which
the
priests
had
been
sprinkling
*NL*
on
it
,
the
reflection
of
the
red
curtains
which
covered
the
windows
*NL*
made
it
look
like
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
Julien
felt
ashamed
of
his
secret
terror
.
``
Am
I
going
to
play
*NL*
the
coward
,
''
he
said
to
himself
:
''
_
To
Arms
!
_
''
This
phrase
,
repeated
so
*NL*
often
in
the
old
Surgeon-Major
's
battle
stories
,
symbolized
heroism
to
*NL*
Julien
.
He
got
up
rapidly
and
walked
to
M.
de
Renal
's
house
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
he
saw
it
twenty
yards
in
front
of
him
he
was
seized
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
his
fine
resolution
,
with
an
overwhelming
timidity
.
The
iron
grill
was
*NL*
open
.
He
thought
it
was
magnificent
.
He
had
to
go
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
not
the
only
person
whose
heart
was
troubled
by
his
arrival
*NL*
in
the
house
.
The
extreme
timidity
of
Madame
de
Renal
was
fluttered
*NL*
when
she
thought
of
this
stranger
whose
functions
would
necessitate
*NL*
his
coming
between
her
and
her
children
.
She
was
accustomed
to
seeing
*NL*
her
sons
sleep
in
her
own
room
.
She
had
shed
many
tears
that
morning
,
*NL*
when
she
had
seen
their
beds
carried
into
the
apartment
intended
for
*NL*
the
tutor
.
It
was
in
vain
that
she
asked
her
husband
to
have
the
bed
of
*NL*
Stanislas-Xavier
,
the
youngest
,
carried
back
into
her
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Womanly
delicacy
was
carried
in
Madame
de
Renal
to
the
point
of
excess
.
*NL*
She
conjured
up
in
her
imagination
the
most
disagreeable
personage
,
who
*NL*
was
coarse
,
badly
groomed
and
encharged
with
the
duty
of
scolding
her
*NL*
children
simply
because
he
happened
to
know
Latin
,
and
only
too
ready
*NL*
to
flog
her
sons
for
their
ignorance
of
that
barbarous
language
.

Madame
de
Renal
was
going
out
of
the
salon
by
the
folding
window
which
*NL*
opened
on
to
the
garden
with
that
vivacity
and
grace
which
was
natural
*NL*
to
her
when
she
was
free
from
human
observation
,
when
she
noticed
a
*NL*
young
peasant
near
the
entrance
gate
.
He
was
still
almost
a
child
,
*NL*
extremely
pale
,
and
looked
as
though
he
had
been
crying
.
He
was
in
a
*NL*
white
shirt
and
had
under
his
arm
a
perfectly
new
suit
of
violet
frieze
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
peasant
's
complexion
was
so
white
and
his
eyes
were
so
soft
,
*NL*
that
Madame
de
Renal
's
somewhat
romantic
spirit
thought
at
first
that
*NL*
it
might
be
a
young
girl
in
disguise
,
who
had
come
to
ask
some
favour
*NL*
of
the
M.
the
Mayor
.
She
took
pity
on
this
poor
creature
,
who
had
*NL*
stopped
at
the
entrance
of
the
door
,
and
who
apparently
did
not
dare
*NL*
to
raise
its
hand
to
the
bell
.
Madame
de
Renal
approached
,
forgetting
*NL*
for
the
moment
the
bitter
chagrin
occasioned
by
the
tutor
's
arrival
.
*NL*
Julien
,
who
was
turned
towards
the
gate
,
did
not
see
her
advance
.
He
*NL*
trembled
when
a
soft
voice
said
quite
close
to
his
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
here
,
my
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
turned
round
sharply
and
was
so
struck
by
Madame
de
Renal
's
*NL*
look
,
full
of
graciousness
as
it
was
,
that
up
to
a
certain
point
he
*NL*
forgot
to
be
nervous
.
Overcome
by
her
beauty
he
soon
forgot
everything
,
*NL*
even
what
he
had
come
for
.
Madame
de
Renal
repeated
her
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
here
to
be
tutor
,
Madame
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
quite
ashamed
*NL*
of
his
tears
which
he
was
drying
as
best
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
remained
silent
.
They
had
a
view
of
each
other
at
close
*NL*
range
.
Julien
had
never
seen
a
human
being
so
well-dressed
,
and
above
*NL*
all
he
had
never
seen
a
woman
with
so
dazzling
a
complexion
speak
to
*NL*
him
at
all
softly
.
Madame
de
Renal
observed
the
big
tears
which
had
*NL*
lingered
on
the
cheeks
of
the
young
peasant
,
those
cheeks
which
had
*NL*
been
so
pale
and
were
now
so
pink
.
Soon
she
began
to
laugh
with
all
the
*NL*
mad
gaiety
of
a
young
girl
,
she
made
fun
of
herself
,
and
was
unable
to
*NL*
realise
the
extent
of
her
happiness
.
So
this
was
that
tutor
whom
she
*NL*
had
imagined
a
dirty
,
badly
dressed
priest
,
who
was
coming
to
scold
and
*NL*
flog
her
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Monsieur
,
''
she
said
to
him
at
last
,
``
you
know
Latin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
``
Monsieur
''
astonished
Julien
so
much
that
he
reflected
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Madame
,
''
he
said
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
so
happy
that
she
plucked
up
the
courage
to
say
to
*NL*
Julien
,
``
You
will
not
scold
the
poor
children
too
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
scold
them
!
''
said
Julien
in
astonishment
;
``
why
should
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
,
will
you
,
Monsieur
,
''
she
added
after
a
little
silence
,
in
*NL*
a
soft
voice
whose
emotion
became
more
and
more
intense
.
``
You
will
be
*NL*
nice
to
them
,
you
promise
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
hear
himself
called
``
Monsieur
''
again
in
all
seriousness
by
so
well
*NL*
dressed
a
lady
was
beyond
all
Julien
's
expectations
.
He
had
always
said
*NL*
to
himself
in
all
the
castles
of
Spain
that
he
had
built
in
his
youth
,
*NL*
that
no
real
lady
would
ever
condescend
to
talk
to
him
except
when
he
*NL*
had
a
fine
uniform
.
Madame
de
Renal
,
on
her
side
,
was
completely
taken
*NL*
in
by
Julien
's
beautiful
complexion
,
his
big
black
eyes
,
and
his
pretty
*NL*
hair
,
which
was
more
than
usually
curly
,
because
he
had
just
plunged
*NL*
his
head
into
the
basin
of
the
public
fountain
in
order
to
refresh
*NL*
himself
.
She
was
over-joyed
to
find
that
this
sinister
tutor
,
whom
*NL*
she
had
feared
to
find
so
harsh
and
severe
to
her
children
,
had
,
as
a
*NL*
matter
of
fact
,
the
timid
manner
of
a
girl
.
The
contrast
between
her
*NL*
fears
and
what
she
now
saw
,
proved
a
great
event
for
Madame
de
Renal
's
*NL*
peaceful
temperament
.
Finally
,
she
recovered
from
her
surprise
.
She
*NL*
was
astonished
to
find
herself
at
the
gate
of
her
own
house
talking
in
*NL*
this
way
and
at
such
close
quarters
to
this
young
and
somewhat
scantily
*NL*
dressed
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
in
,
Monsieur
,
''
she
said
to
him
with
a
certain
air
of
*NL*
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
Madame
de
Renal
's
whole
life
she
had
never
been
so
deeply
moved
*NL*
by
such
a
sense
of
pure
pleasure
.
Never
had
so
gracious
a
vision
*NL*
followed
in
the
wake
of
her
disconcerting
fears
.
So
these
pretty
*NL*
children
of
whom
she
took
such
care
were
not
after
all
to
fall
into
*NL*
the
hands
of
a
dirty
grumbling
priest
.
She
had
scarcely
entered
the
*NL*
vestibule
when
she
turned
round
towards
Julien
,
who
was
following
her
*NL*
trembling
.
His
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
so
fine
a
house
proved
but
*NL*
an
additional
charm
in
Madame
de
Renal
's
eyes
.
She
could
not
believe
*NL*
her
own
eyes
.
It
seemed
to
her
,
above
all
,
that
the
tutor
ought
to
have
*NL*
a
black
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
true
,
Monsieur
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
stopping
once
again
,
and
*NL*
in
mortal
fear
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
,
so
happy
had
her
discovery
*NL*
made
her
.
``
Is
it
true
that
you
know
Latin
?
''
These
words
offended
*NL*
Julien
's
pride
,
and
dissipated
the
charming
atmosphere
which
he
had
*NL*
been
enjoying
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Madame
,
''
he
said
,
trying
to
assume
an
air
of
coldness
,
``
I
know
*NL*
Latin
as
well
as
the
cure
,
who
has
been
good
enough
to
say
sometimes
*NL*
that
I
know
it
even
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
thought
that
Julien
looked
extremely
wicked
.
He
had
*NL*
stopped
two
paces
from
her
.
She
approached
and
said
to
him
in
a
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
beat
my
children
the
first
few
days
,
will
you
,
even
if
they
*NL*
do
not
know
their
lessons
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
softness
and
almost
supplication
of
so
beautiful
a
lady
made
Julien
*NL*
suddenly
forget
what
he
owed
to
his
reputation
as
a
Latinist
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
's
face
was
close
to
his
own
.
He
smelt
the
perfume
of
a
woman
's
*NL*
summer
clothing
,
a
quite
astonishing
experience
for
a
poor
peasant
.
*NL*
Julien
blushed
extremely
,
and
said
with
a
sigh
in
a
faltering
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fear
nothing
,
Madame
,
I
will
obey
you
in
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
now
,
when
her
anxiety
about
her
children
had
been
relieved
*NL*
once
and
for
all
,
that
Madame
de
Renal
was
struck
by
Julien
's
extreme
*NL*
beauty
.
The
comparative
effeminancy
of
his
features
and
his
air
of
*NL*
extreme
embarrassment
did
not
seem
in
any
way
ridiculous
to
a
woman
who
*NL*
was
herself
extremely
timid
.
The
male
air
,
which
is
usually
considered
*NL*
essential
to
a
man
's
beauty
,
would
have
terrified
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
are
you
,
sir
,
''
she
said
to
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
nineteen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
elder
son
is
eleven
,
''
went
on
Madame
de
Renal
,
who
had
completely
*NL*
recovered
her
confidence
.
``
He
will
be
almost
a
chum
for
you
.
You
will
*NL*
talk
sensibly
to
him
.
His
father
started
beating
him
once
.
The
child
*NL*
was
ill
for
a
whole
week
,
and
yet
it
was
only
a
little
tap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
difference
between
him
and
me
,
thought
Julien
.
Why
,
it
was
only
*NL*
yesterday
that
my
father
beat
me
.
How
happy
these
rich
people
are
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
,
who
had
already
begun
to
observe
the
fine
nuances
of
*NL*
the
workings
in
the
tutor
's
mind
,
took
this
fit
of
sadness
for
timidity
*NL*
and
tried
to
encourage
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
,
Monsieur
?
''
she
said
to
him
,
with
an
accent
and
*NL*
a
graciousness
whose
charm
Julien
appreciated
without
being
able
to
*NL*
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
called
Julien
Sorel
,
Madame
.
I
feel
nervous
of
entering
a
strange
*NL*
house
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
.
I
have
need
of
your
protection
*NL*
and
I
want
you
to
make
many
allowances
for
me
during
the
first
few
*NL*
days
.
I
have
never
been
to
the
college
,
I
was
too
poor
.
I
have
never
*NL*
spoken
to
anyone
else
except
my
cousin
who
was
Surgeon-Major
,
Member
*NL*
of
the
Legion
of
Honour
,
and
M.
the
cure
Chelan
.
He
will
give
you
a
*NL*
good
account
of
me
.
My
brothers
always
used
to
beat
me
,
and
you
must
*NL*
not
believe
them
if
they
speak
badly
of
me
to
you
.
You
must
forgive
my
*NL*
faults
,
Madame
.
I
shall
always
mean
everything
for
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
regained
his
confidence
during
this
long
speech
.
He
was
*NL*
examining
Madame
de
Renal
.
Perfect
grace
works
wonders
when
it
is
*NL*
natural
to
the
character
,
and
above
all
,
when
the
person
whom
it
*NL*
adorns
never
thinks
of
trying
to
affect
it
.
Julien
,
who
was
quite
a
*NL*
connoisseur
in
feminine
beauty
,
would
have
sworn
at
this
particular
*NL*
moment
that
she
was
not
more
than
twenty
.
The
rash
idea
of
kissing
her
*NL*
hand
immediately
occurred
to
him
.
He
soon
became
frightened
of
his
*NL*
idea
.
A
minute
later
he
said
to
himself
,
it
will
be
an
act
of
cowardice
*NL*
if
I
do
not
carry
out
an
action
which
may
be
useful
to
me
,
and
lessen
*NL*
the
contempt
which
this
fine
lady
probably
has
for
a
poor
workman
just
*NL*
taken
away
from
the
saw-mill
.
Possibly
Julien
was
a
little
encouraged
*NL*
through
having
heard
some
young
girls
repeat
on
Sundays
during
the
last
*NL*
six
months
the
words
``
pretty
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
internal
debate
,
Madame
de
Renal
was
giving
him
two
or
*NL*
three
hints
on
the
way
to
commence
handling
the
children
.
The
strain
*NL*
Julien
was
putting
on
himself
made
him
once
more
very
pale
.
He
said
*NL*
with
an
air
of
constraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
never
beat
your
children
,
Madame
.
I
swear
it
before
God
.
''
In
*NL*
saying
this
,
he
dared
to
take
Madame
de
Renal
's
hand
and
carry
it
*NL*
to
his
lips
.
She
was
astonished
at
this
act
,
and
after
reflecting
,
*NL*
became
shocked
.
As
the
weather
was
very
warm
,
her
arm
was
quite
bare
*NL*
underneath
the
shawl
,
and
Julien
's
movement
in
carrying
her
hand
to
his
*NL*
lips
entirely
uncovered
it
.
After
a
few
moments
she
scolded
herself
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
her
that
her
anger
had
not
been
quick
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
,
who
had
heard
voices
,
came
out
of
his
study
,
and
assuming
*NL*
the
same
air
of
paternal
majesty
with
which
he
celebrated
marriages
at
*NL*
the
mayoral
office
,
said
to
Julien
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
essential
for
me
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
before
my
children
*NL*
see
you
.
''
He
made
Julien
enter
a
room
and
insisted
on
his
wife
being
*NL*
present
,
although
she
wished
to
leave
them
alone
.
Having
closed
the
*NL*
door
M.
Renal
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
the
cure
has
told
me
that
you
are
a
worthy
person
,
and
everybody
*NL*
here
will
treat
you
with
respect
.
If
I
am
satisfied
with
you
I
will
*NL*
later
on
help
you
in
having
a
little
establishment
of
your
own
.
I
do
*NL*
not
wish
you
to
see
either
anything
more
of
your
relatives
or
your
*NL*
friends
.
Their
tone
is
bound
to
be
prejudicial
to
my
children
.
Here
are
*NL*
thirty-six
francs
for
the
first
month
,
but
I
insist
on
your
word
not
to
*NL*
give
a
sou
of
this
money
to
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
was
piqued
against
the
old
man
for
having
proved
the
*NL*
shrewder
bargainer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Monsieur
,
for
I
have
given
orders
for
everybody
here
to
call
you
*NL*
Monsieur
,
and
you
will
appreciate
the
advantage
of
having
entered
the
*NL*
house
of
real
gentle
folk
,
now
,
Monsieur
,
it
is
not
becoming
for
the
*NL*
children
to
see
you
in
a
jacket
.
''
``
Have
the
servants
seen
him
?
''
said
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
,
''
she
answered
,
with
an
air
of
deep
pensiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
better
.
Put
this
on
,
''
he
said
to
the
surprised
young
man
,
*NL*
giving
him
a
frock-coat
of
his
own
.
``
Let
us
now
go
to
M.
Durand
's
the
*NL*
draper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
M.
de
Renal
came
back
with
the
new
tutor
in
his
black
suit
more
*NL*
than
an
hour
later
,
he
found
his
wife
still
seated
in
the
same
place
.
*NL*
She
felt
calmed
by
Julien
's
presence
.
When
she
examined
him
she
forgot
*NL*
to
be
frightened
of
him
.
Julien
was
not
thinking
about
her
at
all
.
In
*NL*
spite
of
all
his
distrust
of
destiny
and
mankind
,
his
soul
at
this
*NL*
moment
was
as
simple
as
that
of
a
child
.
It
seemed
as
though
he
had
*NL*
lived
through
years
since
the
moment
,
three
hours
ago
,
when
he
had
been
*NL*
all
atremble
in
the
church
.
He
noticed
Madame
de
Renal
's
frigid
manner
*NL*
and
realised
that
she
was
very
angry
,
because
he
had
dared
to
kiss
her
*NL*
hand
.
But
the
proud
consciousness
which
was
given
to
him
by
the
feel
*NL*
of
clothes
so
different
from
those
which
he
usually
wore
,
transported
*NL*
him
so
violently
and
he
had
so
great
a
desire
to
conceal
his
*NL*
exultation
,
that
all
his
movements
were
marked
by
a
certain
spasmodic
*NL*
irresponsibility
.
Madame
de
Renal
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
M.
de
Renal
to
him
,
``
dignity
above
all
is
necessary
if
*NL*
you
wish
to
be
respected
by
my
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
answered
Julien
,
``
I
feel
awkward
in
my
new
clothes
.
I
am
a
poor
*NL*
peasant
and
have
never
wore
anything
but
jackets
.
If
you
allow
it
,
I
*NL*
will
retire
to
my
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
this
`
acquisition
?
'
''
said
M.
de
Renal
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
concealed
the
truth
from
her
husband
,
obeying
an
almost
*NL*
instinctive
impulse
which
she
certainly
did
not
own
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
as
fascinated
as
you
are
by
this
little
peasant
.
Your
favours
*NL*
will
result
in
his
not
being
able
to
keep
his
place
,
and
you
will
have
*NL*
to
send
him
back
before
the
month
is
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
!
we
'll
send
him
back
then
,
he
can
not
run
me
into
more
than
*NL*
a
hundred
francs
,
and
Verrieres
will
have
got
used
to
seeing
M.
de
*NL*
Renal
's
children
with
a
tutor
.
That
result
would
not
have
been
achieved
*NL*
if
I
had
allowed
Julien
to
wear
a
workman
's
clothes
.
If
I
do
send
him
*NL*
back
,
I
shall
of
course
keep
the
complete
black
suit
which
I
have
just
*NL*
ordered
at
the
draper
's
.
All
he
will
keep
is
the
ready-made
suit
which
*NL*
I
have
just
put
him
into
at
the
the
tailor
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
that
Julien
spent
in
his
room
seemed
only
a
minute
to
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
.
The
children
who
had
been
told
about
their
new
tutor
began
*NL*
to
overwhelm
their
mother
with
questions
.
Eventually
Julien
appeared
.
*NL*
He
was
quite
another
man
.
It
would
be
incorrect
to
say
that
he
was
*NL*
grave
--
he
was
the
very
incarnation
of
gravity
.
He
was
introduced
to
*NL*
the
children
and
spoke
to
them
in
a
manner
that
astonished
M.
de
Renal
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
here
,
gentlemen
,
he
said
,
as
he
finished
his
speech
,
to
teach
*NL*
you
Latin
.
You
know
what
it
means
to
recite
a
lesson
.
Here
is
the
Holy
*NL*
Bible
,
he
said
,
showing
them
a
small
volume
in
thirty-two
mo.
,
bound
in
*NL*
black
.
It
deals
especially
with
the
history
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
*NL*
and
is
the
part
which
is
called
the
New
Testament
.
I
shall
often
make
*NL*
you
recite
your
lesson
,
but
do
you
make
me
now
recite
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adolphe
,
the
eldest
of
the
children
,
had
taken
up
the
book
.
``
Open
it
*NL*
anywhere
you
like
,
''
went
on
Julien
and
tell
me
the
first
word
of
any
*NL*
verse
,
``
I
will
then
recite
by
heart
that
sacred
book
which
governs
our
*NL*
conduct
towards
the
whole
world
,
until
you
stop
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adolphe
opened
the
book
and
read
a
word
,
and
Julien
recited
the
whole
*NL*
of
the
page
as
easily
as
though
he
had
been
talking
French
.
M.
de
Renal
*NL*
looked
at
his
wife
with
an
air
of
triumph
The
children
,
seeing
the
*NL*
astonishment
of
their
parents
,
opened
their
eyes
wide
.
A
servant
came
*NL*
to
the
door
of
the
drawing-room
;
Julien
went
on
talking
Latin
.
The
*NL*
servant
first
remained
motionless
,
and
then
disappeared
.
Soon
Madame
's
*NL*
house-maid
,
together
with
the
cook
,
arrived
at
the
door
.
Adolphe
had
*NL*
already
opened
the
book
at
eight
different
places
,
while
Julien
went
*NL*
on
reciting
all
the
time
with
the
same
facility
.
``
Great
heavens
!
''
said
*NL*
the
cook
,
a
good
and
devout
girl
,
quite
aloud
,
``
what
a
pretty
little
*NL*
priest
!
''
M.
de
Renal
's
self-esteem
became
uneasy
.
Instead
of
thinking
*NL*
of
examining
the
tutor
,
his
mind
was
concentrated
in
racking
his
memory
*NL*
for
some
other
Latin
words
.
Eventually
he
managed
to
spout
a
phrase
of
*NL*
Horace
.
Julien
knew
no
other
Latin
except
his
Bible
.
He
answered
with
a
*NL*
frown
.
``
The
holy
ministry
to
which
I
destine
myself
has
forbidden
me
to
*NL*
read
so
profane
a
poet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
quoted
quite
a
large
number
of
alleged
verses
from
Horace
.
*NL*
He
explained
to
his
children
who
Horace
was
,
but
the
admiring
children
,
*NL*
scarcely
attended
to
what
he
was
saying
:
they
were
looking
at
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servants
were
still
at
the
door
.
Julien
thought
that
he
ought
to
*NL*
prolong
the
test
--
``
M.
Stanislas-Xavier
also
,
''
he
said
to
the
youngest
*NL*
of
the
children
,
``
must
give
me
a
passage
from
the
holy
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Stanislas
,
who
was
quite
flattered
,
read
indifferently
the
first
*NL*
word
of
a
verse
,
and
Julien
said
the
whole
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
put
the
finishing
touch
on
M.
de
Renal
's
triumph
,
M.
Valenod
,
the
*NL*
owner
of
the
fine
Norman
horses
,
and
M.
Charcot
de
Maugiron
,
the
*NL*
sub-prefect
of
the
district
came
in
when
Julien
was
reciting
.
This
*NL*
scene
earned
for
Julien
the
title
of
Monsieur
;
even
the
servants
did
*NL*
not
dare
to
refuse
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
all
Verrieres
flocked
to
M.
de
Renal
's
to
see
the
prodigy
.
*NL*
Julien
answered
everybody
in
a
gloomy
manner
and
kept
his
own
distance
.
*NL*
His
fame
spread
so
rapidly
in
the
town
that
a
few
hours
afterwards
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
,
fearing
that
he
would
be
taken
away
by
somebody
else
,
*NL*
proposed
to
that
he
should
sign
an
engagement
for
two
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Monsieur
,
''
Julien
answered
coldly
,
``
if
you
wished
to
dismiss
me
,
I
*NL*
should
have
to
go
.
An
engagement
which
binds
me
without
involving
you
*NL*
in
any
obligation
is
not
an
equal
one
and
I
refuse
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
played
his
cards
so
well
,
that
in
less
than
a
month
of
his
*NL*
arrival
at
the
house
,
M.
de
Renal
himself
respected
him
.
As
the
cure
*NL*
had
quarrelled
with
both
M.
de
Renal
and
M.
Valenod
,
there
was
no
one
*NL*
who
could
betray
Julien
's
old
passion
for
Napoleon
.
He
always
spoke
of
*NL*
Napoleon
with
abhorrence
.

*NL*
THE
ELECTIVE
AFFINITIES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
only
manage
to
touch
the
heart
by
wounding
it
.
--
_
A
*NL*
Modern
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
adored
him
,
but
he
did
not
like
them
in
the
least
.
His
*NL*
thoughts
were
elsewhere
.
But
nothing
which
the
little
brats
ever
did
*NL*
made
him
lose
his
patience
.
Cold
,
just
and
impassive
,
and
none
the
less
*NL*
liked
,
inasmuch
his
arrival
had
more
or
less
driven
ennui
out
of
the
*NL*
house
,
he
was
a
good
tutor
.
As
for
himself
,
he
felt
nothing
but
hate
*NL*
and
abhorrence
for
that
good
society
into
which
he
had
been
admitted
;
*NL*
admitted
,
it
is
true
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
a
circumstance
which
*NL*
perhaps
explained
his
hate
and
his
abhorrence
.
There
were
certain
*NL*
`
full-dress
'
dinners
at
which
he
was
scarcely
able
to
control
his
*NL*
hate
for
everything
that
surrounded
him
.
One
St.
Louis
feast
day
in
*NL*
particular
,
when
M.
Valenod
was
monopolizing
the
conversation
of
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
,
Julien
was
on
the
point
of
betraying
himself
.
He
escaped
*NL*
into
the
garden
on
the
pretext
of
finding
the
children
.
``
What
praise
*NL*
of
honesty
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
One
would
say
that
was
the
only
virtue
,
*NL*
and
yet
think
how
they
respect
and
grovel
before
a
man
who
has
almost
*NL*
doubled
and
trebled
his
fortune
since
he
has
administered
the
poor
*NL*
fund
.
I
would
bet
anything
that
he
makes
a
profit
even
out
of
the
*NL*
monies
which
are
intended
for
the
foundlings
of
these
poor
creatures
*NL*
whose
misery
is
even
more
sacred
than
that
of
others
.
Oh
,
Monsters
!
*NL*
Monsters
!
And
I
too
,
am
a
kind
of
foundling
,
hated
as
I
am
by
my
*NL*
father
,
my
brothers
,
and
all
my
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
days
before
the
feast
of
St.
Louis
,
when
Julien
was
taking
a
*NL*
solitary
walk
and
reciting
his
breviary
in
the
little
wood
called
*NL*
the
Belvedere
,
which
dominates
the
_
Cours
de
la
Fidelite
_
,
he
had
*NL*
endeavoured
in
vain
to
avoid
his
two
brothers
whom
he
saw
coming
along
*NL*
in
the
distance
by
a
lonely
path
.
The
jealousy
of
these
coarse
workmen
*NL*
had
been
provoked
to
such
a
pitch
by
their
brother
's
fine
black
suit
,
*NL*
by
his
air
of
extreme
respectability
,
and
by
the
sincere
contempt
which
*NL*
he
had
for
them
,
that
they
had
beaten
him
until
he
had
fainted
and
was
*NL*
bleeding
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
,
who
was
taking
a
walk
with
M.
de
Renal
and
the
*NL*
sub-prefect
,
happened
to
arrive
in
the
little
wood
.
She
saw
Julien
*NL*
lying
on
the
ground
and
thought
that
he
was
dead
.
She
was
so
overcome
*NL*
that
she
made
M.
Valenod
jealous
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
alarm
was
premature
.
Julien
found
Madame
de
Renal
very
pretty
,
but
*NL*
he
hated
her
on
account
of
her
beauty
,
for
that
had
been
the
first
*NL*
danger
which
had
almost
stopped
his
career
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
talked
to
her
as
little
as
possible
,
in
order
to
make
her
forget
the
*NL*
transport
which
had
induced
him
to
kiss
her
hand
on
the
first
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
's
housemaid
,
Elisa
,
had
lost
no
time
in
falling
*NL*
in
love
with
the
young
tutor
.
She
often
talked
about
him
to
her
*NL*
mistress
.
Elisa
's
love
had
earned
for
Julien
the
hatred
of
one
of
the
*NL*
men-servants
.
One
day
he
heard
the
man
saying
to
Elisa
,
``
You
have
n't
*NL*
a
word
for
me
now
that
this
dirty
tutor
has
entered
the
household
.
''
*NL*
The
insult
was
undeserved
,
but
Julien
with
the
instinctive
vanity
of
a
*NL*
pretty
boy
redoubled
his
care
of
his
personal
appearance
.
M.
Valenod
's
*NL*
hate
also
increased
.
He
said
publicly
,
that
it
was
not
becoming
for
a
*NL*
young
abbe
to
be
such
a
fop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
observed
that
Julien
talked
more
frequently
than
usual
*NL*
to
Mademoiselle
Elisa
.
She
learnt
that
the
reason
of
these
interviews
*NL*
was
the
poverty
of
Julien
's
extremely
small
wardrobe
.
He
had
so
little
*NL*
linen
that
he
was
obliged
to
have
it
very
frequently
washed
outside
the
*NL*
house
,
and
it
was
in
these
little
matters
that
Elisa
was
useful
to
him
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
touched
by
this
extreme
poverty
which
she
had
never
*NL*
suspected
before
.
She
was
anxious
to
make
him
presents
,
but
she
did
not
*NL*
dare
to
do
so
.
This
inner
conflict
was
the
first
painful
emotion
that
*NL*
Julien
had
caused
her
.
Till
then
Julien
's
name
had
been
synonymous
with
*NL*
a
pure
and
quite
intellectual
joy
.
Tormented
by
the
idea
of
Julien
's
*NL*
poverty
,
Madame
de
Renal
spoke
to
her
husband
about
giving
him
some
*NL*
linen
for
a
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
,
''
he
answered
,
``
the
very
idea
of
giving
presents
to
a
*NL*
man
with
whom
we
are
perfectly
satisfied
and
who
is
a
good
servant
.
It
*NL*
will
only
be
if
he
is
remiss
that
we
shall
have
to
stimulate
his
zeal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
felt
humiliated
by
this
way
of
looking
at
things
,
*NL*
though
she
would
never
have
noticed
it
in
the
days
before
Julien
's
*NL*
arrival
.
She
never
looked
at
the
young
abbe
's
attire
,
with
its
*NL*
combination
of
simplicity
and
absolute
cleanliness
,
without
saying
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
The
poor
boy
,
how
can
he
manage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
,
instead
of
being
shocked
by
all
Julien
's
*NL*
deficiencies
,
she
pitied
him
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
one
of
those
provincial
women
whom
one
is
apt
*NL*
to
take
for
fools
during
the
first
fortnight
of
acquaintanceship
.
*NL*
She
had
no
experience
of
the
world
and
never
bothered
to
keep
up
the
*NL*
conversation
.
Nature
had
given
her
a
refined
and
fastidious
soul
,
*NL*
while
that
instinct
for
happiness
which
is
innate
in
all
human
beings
*NL*
caused
her
,
as
a
rule
,
to
pay
no
attention
to
the
acts
of
the
coarse
*NL*
persons
in
whose
midst
chance
had
thrown
her
.
If
she
had
received
the
*NL*
slightest
education
,
she
would
have
been
noticeable
for
the
spontaneity
*NL*
and
vivacity
of
her
mind
,
but
being
an
heiress
,
she
had
been
brought
*NL*
up
in
a
Convent
of
Nuns
,
who
were
passionate
devotees
of
the
_
Sacred
*NL*
Heart
of
Jesus
_
and
animated
by
a
violent
hate
for
the
French
as
being
*NL*
the
enemies
of
the
Jesuits
.
Madame
de
Renal
had
had
enough
sense
to
*NL*
forget
quickly
all
the
nonsense
which
she
had
learned
at
the
convent
,
*NL*
but
had
substituted
nothing
for
it
,
and
in
the
long
run
knew
nothing
.
*NL*
The
flatteries
which
had
been
lavished
on
her
when
still
a
child
,
by
*NL*
reason
of
the
great
fortune
of
which
she
was
the
heiress
,
and
a
decided
*NL*
tendency
to
passionate
devotion
,
had
given
her
quite
an
inner
life
of
*NL*
her
own
.
In
spite
of
her
pose
of
perfect
affability
and
her
elimination
*NL*
of
her
individual
will
which
was
cited
as
a
model
example
by
all
the
*NL*
husbands
in
Verrieres
and
which
made
M.
de
Renal
feel
very
proud
,
the
*NL*
moods
of
her
mind
were
usually
dictated
by
a
spirit
of
the
most
haughty
*NL*
discontent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
a
princess
who
has
become
a
bye-word
for
pride
has
given
*NL*
infinitely
more
attention
to
what
her
courtiers
have
been
doing
around
*NL*
her
than
did
this
apparently
gentle
and
demure
woman
to
anything
which
*NL*
her
husband
either
said
or
did
.
Up
to
the
time
of
Julien
's
arrival
she
*NL*
had
never
really
troubled
about
anything
except
her
children
.
Their
*NL*
little
maladies
,
their
troubles
,
their
little
joys
,
occupied
all
the
*NL*
sensibility
of
that
soul
,
who
,
during
her
whole
life
,
had
adored
no
one
*NL*
but
God
,
when
she
had
been
at
the
Sacred
Heart
of
Besancon
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
feverish
attack
of
one
of
her
sons
would
affect
her
almost
as
deeply
*NL*
as
if
the
child
had
died
,
though
she
would
not
deign
to
confide
*NL*
in
anyone
.
A
burst
of
coarse
laughter
,
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
some
platitude
on
the
folly
of
women
,
had
been
the
only
*NL*
welcome
her
husband
had
vouchsafed
to
those
confidences
about
her
*NL*
troubles
,
which
the
need
of
unburdening
herself
had
induced
her
to
make
*NL*
during
the
first
years
of
their
marriage
.
Jokes
of
this
kind
,
and
above
*NL*
all
,
when
they
were
directed
at
her
children
's
ailments
,
were
exquisite
*NL*
torture
to
Madame
de
Renal
.
And
these
jokes
were
all
she
found
to
take
*NL*
the
place
of
those
exaggerated
sugary
flatteries
with
which
she
had
*NL*
been
regaled
at
the
Jesuit
Convent
where
she
had
passed
her
youth
.
Her
*NL*
education
had
been
given
her
by
suffering
.
Too
proud
even
to
talk
to
*NL*
her
friend
,
Madame
Derville
,
about
troubles
of
this
kind
,
she
imagined
*NL*
that
all
men
were
like
her
husband
,
M.
Valenod
,
and
the
sub-prefect
,
*NL*
M.
Charcot
de
Maugiron
.
Coarseness
,
and
the
most
brutal
callousness
to
*NL*
everything
except
financial
gain
,
precedence
,
or
orders
,
together
with
*NL*
blind
hate
of
every
argument
to
which
they
objected
,
seemed
to
her
as
*NL*
natural
to
the
male
sex
as
wearing
boots
and
felt
hats
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
many
years
,
Madame
de
Renal
had
still
failed
to
acclimatize
*NL*
herself
to
those
monied
people
in
whose
society
she
had
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
the
success
of
the
little
peasant
Julien
.
She
found
in
the
*NL*
sympathy
of
this
proud
and
noble
soul
a
sweet
enjoyment
which
had
all
*NL*
the
glamour
and
fascination
of
novelty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
soon
forgave
him
that
extreme
ignorance
,
which
*NL*
constituted
but
an
additional
charm
,
and
the
roughness
of
his
manner
*NL*
which
she
succeeded
in
correcting
.
She
thought
that
he
was
worth
*NL*
listening
to
,
even
when
the
conversation
turned
on
the
most
ordinary
*NL*
events
,
even
in
fact
when
it
was
only
a
question
of
a
poor
dog
which
*NL*
had
been
crushed
as
he
crossed
the
street
by
a
peasant
's
cart
going
*NL*
at
a
trot
.
The
sight
of
the
dog
's
pain
made
her
husband
indulge
in
*NL*
his
coarse
laugh
,
while
she
noticed
Julien
frown
,
with
his
fine
black
*NL*
eyebrows
which
were
so
beautifully
arched
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
,
it
seemed
to
her
that
generosity
,
nobility
of
soul
*NL*
and
humanity
were
to
be
found
in
nobody
else
except
this
young
abbe
.
*NL*
She
felt
for
him
all
the
sympathy
and
even
all
the
admiration
which
*NL*
those
virtues
excite
in
well-born
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
scene
had
been
Paris
,
Julien
's
position
towards
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
would
have
been
soon
simplified
.
But
at
Paris
,
love
is
a
creature
of
*NL*
novels
.
The
young
tutor
and
his
timid
mistress
would
soon
have
found
*NL*
the
elucidation
of
their
position
in
three
or
four
novels
,
and
even
*NL*
in
the
couplets
of
the
Gymnase
Theatre
.
The
novels
which
have
traced
*NL*
out
for
them
the
part
they
would
play
,
and
showed
them
the
model
which
*NL*
they
were
to
imitate
,
and
Julien
would
sooner
or
later
have
been
forced
*NL*
by
his
vanity
to
follow
that
model
,
even
though
it
had
given
him
no
*NL*
pleasure
and
had
perhaps
actually
gone
against
the
grain
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
scene
had
been
laid
in
a
small
town
in
Aveyron
or
the
Pyrenees
,
*NL*
the
slightest
episode
would
have
been
rendered
crucial
by
the
fiery
*NL*
condition
of
the
atmosphere
.
But
under
our
more
gloomy
skies
,
a
poor
*NL*
young
man
who
is
only
ambitious
because
his
natural
refinement
makes
*NL*
him
feel
the
necessity
of
some
of
those
joys
which
only
money
can
give
,
*NL*
can
see
every
day
a
woman
of
thirty
who
is
sincerely
virtuous
,
is
*NL*
absorbed
in
her
children
,
and
never
goes
to
novels
for
her
examples
of
*NL*
conduct
.
Everything
goes
slowly
,
everything
happens
gradually
,
in
the
*NL*
provinces
where
there
is
far
more
naturalness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
often
overcome
to
the
point
of
tears
when
she
*NL*
thought
of
the
young
tutor
's
poverty
.
Julien
surprised
her
one
day
*NL*
actually
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Madame
!
has
any
misfortune
happened
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
friend
,
''
she
answered
,
``
call
the
children
,
let
us
go
for
a
*NL*
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
his
arm
and
leant
on
it
in
a
manner
that
struck
Julien
as
*NL*
singular
.
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
called
Julien
``
My
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
end
of
the
walk
,
Julien
noticed
that
she
was
blushing
*NL*
violently
.
She
slackened
her
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
doubt
heard
,
''
she
said
,
without
looking
at
him
,
``
that
I
*NL*
am
the
only
heiress
of
a
very
rich
aunt
who
lives
at
Besancon
.
She
*NL*
loads
me
with
presents
...
My
sons
are
getting
on
so
wonderfully
that
*NL*
I
should
like
to
ask
you
to
accept
a
small
present
as
a
token
of
my
*NL*
gratitude
.
It
is
only
a
matter
of
a
few
louis
to
enable
you
to
get
*NL*
some
linen
.
But
--
''
she
added
,
blushing
still
more
,
and
she
left
off
*NL*
speaking
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
,
Madame
?
''
said
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
unnecessary
,
''
she
went
on
lowering
her
head
,
``
to
mention
this
to
*NL*
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
not
be
big
,
Madame
,
but
I
am
not
mean
,
''
answered
Julien
,
*NL*
stopping
,
and
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
,
with
his
*NL*
eyes
shining
with
rage
,
``
and
this
is
what
you
have
not
realised
*NL*
sufficiently
.
I
should
be
lower
than
a
menial
if
I
were
to
put
myself
*NL*
in
the
position
of
concealing
from
M
de
.
Renal
anything
at
all
having
*NL*
to
do
with
my
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
thunderstruck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Mayor
,
''
went
on
Julien
,
``
has
given
me
on
five
occasions
sums
of
*NL*
thirty-six
francs
since
I
have
been
living
in
his
house
.
I
am
ready
*NL*
to
show
any
account-book
to
M.
de
Renal
and
anyone
else
,
even
to
M.
*NL*
Valenod
who
hates
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
result
of
this
outburst
,
Madame
de
Renal
remained
pale
and
*NL*
nervous
,
and
the
walk
ended
without
either
one
or
the
other
finding
any
*NL*
pretext
for
renewing
the
conversation
.
Julien
's
proud
heart
had
found
*NL*
it
more
and
more
impossible
to
love
Madame
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
her
,
she
respected
him
,
she
admired
him
,
and
she
had
been
*NL*
scolded
by
him
.
Under
the
pretext
of
making
up
for
the
involuntary
*NL*
humiliation
which
she
had
caused
him
,
she
indulged
in
acts
of
the
most
*NL*
tender
solicitude
.
The
novelty
of
these
attentions
made
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
happy
for
eight
days
.
Their
effect
was
to
appease
to
some
extent
*NL*
Julien
's
anger
.
He
was
far
from
seeing
anything
in
them
in
the
nature
*NL*
of
a
fancy
for
himself
personally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
just
what
rich
people
are
,
''
he
said
to
himself
--
``
they
snub
you
*NL*
and
then
they
think
they
can
make
up
for
everything
by
a
few
monkey
*NL*
tricks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
's
heart
was
too
full
,
and
at
the
same
time
too
*NL*
innocent
,
for
her
not
too
tell
her
husband
,
in
spite
of
her
resolutions
*NL*
not
to
do
so
,
about
the
offer
she
had
made
to
Julien
,
and
the
manner
in
*NL*
which
she
had
been
rebuffed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
on
earth
,
''
answered
M.
de
Renal
,
keenly
piqued
,
``
could
you
put
*NL*
up
with
a
refusal
on
the
part
of
a
servant
,
''
--
and
,
when
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
protested
against
the
word
``
Servant
,
''
``
I
am
using
,
madam
,
the
*NL*
words
of
the
late
Prince
of
Conde
,
when
he
presented
his
Chamberlains
*NL*
to
his
new
wife
.
`
All
these
people
'
he
said
`
are
servants
.
'
I
have
*NL*
also
read
you
this
passage
from
the
Memoirs
of
Besenval
,
a
book
which
*NL*
is
indispensable
on
all
questions
of
etiquette
.
`
Every
person
,
not
*NL*
a
gentleman
,
who
lives
in
your
house
and
receives
a
salary
is
your
*NL*
servant
.
'
I
'll
go
and
say
a
few
words
to
M.
Julien
and
give
him
a
*NL*
hundred
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Madame
De
Renal
trembling
,
``
I
hope
you
wo
n't
do
it
*NL*
before
the
servants
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
might
be
jealous
and
rightly
so
,
''
said
her
husband
as
he
*NL*
took
his
leave
,
thinking
of
the
greatness
of
the
sum
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
fell
on
a
chair
almost
fainting
in
her
anguish
.
He
is
*NL*
going
to
humiliate
Julien
,
and
it
is
my
fault
!
She
felt
an
abhorrence
*NL*
for
her
husband
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
.
She
resolved
that
*NL*
henceforth
she
would
never
make
any
more
confidences
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
saw
Julien
again
she
was
trembling
all
over
.
Her
chest
was
so
*NL*
cramped
that
she
could
not
succeed
in
pronouncing
a
single
word
.
In
her
*NL*
embarrassment
she
took
his
hands
and
pressed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
friend
,
''
she
said
to
him
at
last
,
``
are
you
satisfied
with
my
*NL*
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
be
otherwise
,
''
answered
Julien
,
with
a
bitter
smile
,
``
he
*NL*
has
given
me
a
hundred
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
looked
at
him
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
your
arm
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
with
a
courageous
intonation
that
*NL*
Julien
had
not
heard
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
dared
to
go
as
far
as
the
shop
of
the
bookseller
of
Verrieres
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
awful
reputation
for
Liberalism
.
In
the
shop
she
chose
*NL*
ten
louis
worth
of
books
for
a
present
for
her
sons
.
But
these
books
*NL*
were
those
which
she
knew
Julien
was
wanting
.
She
insisted
on
each
*NL*
child
writing
his
name
then
and
there
in
the
bookseller
's
shop
in
*NL*
those
books
which
fell
to
his
lot
.
While
Madame
de
Renal
was
rejoicing
*NL*
over
the
kind
reparation
which
she
had
had
the
courage
to
make
to
*NL*
Julien
,
the
latter
was
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
at
the
quantity
*NL*
of
books
which
he
saw
at
the
bookseller
's
.
He
had
never
dared
to
enter
*NL*
so
profane
a
place
.
His
heart
was
palpitating
.
Instead
of
trying
to
*NL*
guess
what
was
passing
in
Madame
de
Renal
's
heart
he
pondered
deeply
*NL*
over
the
means
by
which
a
young
theological
student
could
procure
*NL*
some
of
those
books
.
Eventually
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
be
*NL*
possible
,
with
tact
,
to
persuade
M.
de
Renal
that
one
of
the
proper
*NL*
subjects
of
his
sons
'
curriculum
would
be
the
history
of
the
celebrated
*NL*
gentlemen
who
had
been
born
in
the
province
.
After
a
month
of
careful
*NL*
preparation
Julien
witnessed
the
success
of
this
idea
.
The
success
was
*NL*
so
great
that
he
actually
dared
to
risk
mentioning
to
M.
de
Renal
in
*NL*
conversation
,
a
matter
which
the
noble
mayor
found
disagreeable
from
*NL*
quite
another
point
of
view
.
The
suggestion
was
to
contribute
to
the
*NL*
fortune
of
a
Liberal
by
taking
a
subscription
at
the
bookseller
's
.
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
agreed
that
it
would
be
wise
to
give
his
elder
son
a
first
*NL*
hand
acquaintance
with
many
works
which
he
would
hear
mentioned
in
*NL*
conversation
when
he
went
to
the
Military
School
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Julien
saw
that
the
mayor
had
determined
to
go
no
further
.
He
*NL*
suspected
some
secret
reason
but
could
not
guess
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
,
sir
,
''
he
said
to
him
one
day
,
``
that
it
would
be
highly
*NL*
undesirable
for
the
name
of
so
good
a
gentleman
as
a
Renal
to
appear
on
*NL*
a
bookseller
's
dirty
ledger
.
''
M.
de
Renal
's
face
cleared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
also
be
a
black
mark
,
''
continued
Julien
in
a
more
humble
*NL*
tone
,
``
against
a
poor
theology
student
if
it
ever
leaked
out
that
his
*NL*
name
had
been
on
the
ledger
of
a
bookseller
who
let
out
books
.
The
*NL*
Liberals
might
go
so
far
as
to
accuse
me
of
having
asked
for
the
most
*NL*
infamous
books
.
Who
knows
if
they
will
not
even
go
so
far
as
to
write
*NL*
the
titles
of
those
perverse
volumes
after
my
name
?
''
But
Julien
was
*NL*
getting
off
the
track
.
He
noticed
that
the
Mayor
's
physiognomy
was
*NL*
re-assuming
its
expression
of
embarrassment
and
displeasure
.
Julien
was
*NL*
silent
.
``
I
have
caught
my
man
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
a
few
days
afterwards
the
elder
of
the
children
*NL*
asked
Julien
,
in
M.
de
Renal
's
presence
,
about
a
book
which
had
been
*NL*
advertised
in
the
_
Quotidienne
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
order
to
prevent
the
Jacobin
Party
having
the
slightest
pretext
for
*NL*
a
score
,
''
said
the
young
tutor
,
``
and
yet
give
me
the
means
of
answering
*NL*
M.
de
Adolphe
's
question
,
you
can
make
your
most
menial
servant
take
*NL*
out
a
subscription
at
the
booksellers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
a
bad
idea
,
''
said
M.
de
Renal
,
who
was
obviously
very
*NL*
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
have
to
stipulate
all
the
same
,
''
said
Julien
in
that
solemn
*NL*
and
almost
melancholy
manner
which
suits
some
people
so
well
when
they
*NL*
see
the
realization
of
matters
which
they
have
desired
for
a
long
time
*NL*
past
,
``
you
will
have
to
stipulate
that
the
servant
should
not
take
out
*NL*
any
novels
.
Those
dangerous
books
,
once
they
got
into
the
house
,
might
*NL*
corrupt
Madame
de
Renal
's
maids
,
and
even
the
servant
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
forgetting
the
political
pamphlets
,
''
went
on
M.
de
Renal
with
*NL*
an
important
air
.
He
was
anxious
to
conceal
the
admiration
with
which
*NL*
the
cunning
``
middle
course
''
devised
by
his
children
's
tutor
had
filled
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
Julien
's
life
was
made
up
of
a
series
of
little
acts
of
*NL*
diplomacy
,
and
their
success
gave
him
far
more
food
for
thought
than
*NL*
the
marked
manifestation
of
favouritism
which
he
could
have
read
at
any
*NL*
time
in
Madame
de
Renal
's
heart
,
had
he
so
wished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
psychological
position
in
which
he
had
found
himself
all
his
*NL*
life
was
renewed
again
in
the
mayor
of
Verrieres
'
house
.
Here
in
the
*NL*
same
way
as
at
his
father
's
saw-mill
,
he
deeply
despised
the
people
*NL*
with
whom
he
lived
,
and
was
hated
by
them
.
He
saw
every
day
in
the
*NL*
conversation
of
the
sub-perfect
,
M.
Valenod
and
the
other
friends
of
*NL*
the
family
,
about
things
which
had
just
taken
place
under
their
very
*NL*
eyes
,
how
little
ideas
corresponded
to
reality
.
If
an
action
seemed
to
*NL*
Julien
worthy
of
admiration
,
it
was
precisely
that
very
action
which
*NL*
would
bring
down
upon
itself
the
censure
of
the
people
with
whom
he
*NL*
lived
.
His
inner
mental
reply
always
was
,
``
What
beasts
or
what
fools
!
''
*NL*
The
joke
was
that
,
in
spite
of
all
his
pride
,
he
often
understood
*NL*
absolutely
nothing
what
they
were
talking
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
his
whole
life
he
had
only
spoken
sincerely
to
the
old
*NL*
Surgeon-Major
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
few
ideas
he
had
were
about
Buonaparte
's
Italian
Campaigns
or
else
*NL*
surgery
.
His
youthful
courage
revelled
in
the
circumstantial
details
of
*NL*
the
most
terrible
operations
.
He
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
have
flinched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
time
that
Madame
de
Renal
tried
to
enter
into
conversation
*NL*
independently
of
the
children
's
education
,
he
began
to
talk
of
surgical
*NL*
operations
.
She
grew
pale
and
asked
him
to
leave
off
.
Julien
knew
*NL*
nothing
beyond
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
came
about
that
,
though
he
passed
his
life
in
Madame
de
Renal
's
*NL*
company
,
the
most
singular
silence
would
reign
between
them
as
soon
as
*NL*
they
were
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
in
the
salon
,
she
noticed
in
his
eyes
,
in
spite
of
all
the
*NL*
humbleness
of
his
demeanour
,
an
air
of
intellectual
superiority
towards
*NL*
everyone
who
came
to
visit
her
.
If
she
found
herself
alone
with
him
for
*NL*
a
single
moment
,
she
saw
that
he
was
palpably
embarrassed
.
This
made
*NL*
her
feel
uneasy
,
for
her
woman
's
instinct
caused
her
to
realise
that
*NL*
this
embarrassment
was
not
inspired
by
any
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
to
some
mysterious
idea
,
derived
from
some
tale
of
good
society
,
*NL*
such
as
the
old
Surgeon-Major
had
seen
it
,
Julien
felt
humiliated
*NL*
whenever
the
conversation
languished
on
any
occasion
when
he
found
*NL*
himself
in
a
woman
's
society
,
as
though
the
particular
pause
were
his
*NL*
own
special
fault
.
This
sensation
was
a
hundred
times
more
painful
in
*NL*
_
tete-a-tete
_
.
His
imagination
,
full
as
it
was
of
the
most
extravagant
*NL*
and
most
Spanish
ideas
of
what
a
man
ought
to
say
when
he
is
alone
*NL*
with
a
woman
,
only
suggested
to
the
troubled
youth
things
which
were
*NL*
absolutely
impossible
.
His
soul
was
in
the
clouds
.
Nevertheless
he
was
*NL*
unable
to
emerge
from
this
most
humiliating
silence
.
Consequently
,
*NL*
during
his
long
walks
with
Madame
de
Renal
and
the
children
,
the
*NL*
severity
of
his
manner
was
accentuated
by
the
poignancy
of
his
*NL*
sufferings
.
He
despised
himself
terribly
.
If
,
by
any
luck
,
he
made
*NL*
himself
speak
,
he
came
out
with
the
most
absurd
things
.
To
put
the
*NL*
finishing
touch
on
his
misery
,
he
saw
his
own
absurdity
and
exaggerated
*NL*
its
extent
,
but
what
he
did
not
see
was
the
expression
in
his
eyes
,
*NL*
which
were
so
beautiful
and
betokened
so
ardent
a
soul
,
that
like
good
*NL*
actors
,
they
sometimes
gave
charm
to
something
which
is
really
devoid
*NL*
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
noticed
that
when
he
was
alone
with
her
he
never
*NL*
chanced
to
say
a
good
thing
except
when
he
was
taken
out
of
himself
*NL*
by
some
unexpected
event
,
and
consequently
forgot
to
try
and
turn
a
*NL*
compliment
.
As
the
friends
of
the
house
did
not
spoil
her
by
regaling
*NL*
her
with
new
and
brilliant
ideas
,
she
enjoyed
with
delight
all
the
*NL*
flashes
of
Julien
's
intellect
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
fall
of
Napoleon
,
every
appearance
of
gallantry
has
been
*NL*
severely
exiled
from
provincial
etiquette
.
People
are
frightened
of
*NL*
losing
their
jobs
.
All
rascals
look
to
the
religious
order
for
support
,
*NL*
and
hypocrisy
has
made
firm
progress
even
among
the
Liberal
classes
.
*NL*
One
's
ennui
is
doubled
.
The
only
pleasures
left
are
reading
and
*NL*
agriculture

*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
,
the
rich
heiress
of
a
devout
aunt
,
and
married
at
*NL*
sixteen
to
a
respectable
gentleman
,
had
never
felt
or
seen
in
her
whole
*NL*
life
anything
that
had
the
slightest
resemblance
in
the
whole
world
*NL*
to
love
.
Her
confessor
,
the
good
cure
Chelan
,
had
once
mentioned
love
*NL*
to
her
,
in
discussing
the
advances
of
M.
de
Valenod
,
and
had
drawn
so
*NL*
loathsome
a
picture
of
the
passion
that
the
word
now
stood
to
her
for
*NL*
nothing
but
the
most
abject
debauchery
.
She
had
regarded
love
,
such
*NL*
as
she
had
come
across
it
,
in
the
very
small
number
of
novels
with
*NL*
which
chance
had
made
her
acquainted
,
as
an
exception
if
not
indeed
as
*NL*
something
absolutely
abnormal
.
It
was
,
thanks
to
this
ignorance
,
that
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
,
although
incessantly
absorbed
in
Julien
,
was
perfectly
*NL*
happy
,
and
never
thought
of
reproaching
herself
in
the
slightest
.

It
was
only
when
Madame
de
Renal
began
to
think
of
her
maid
Elisa
*NL*
that
there
was
some
slight
change
in
that
angelic
sweetness
which
she
*NL*
owed
both
to
her
natural
character
and
her
actual
happiness
.
The
girl
*NL*
had
come
into
a
fortune
,
went
to
confess
herself
to
the
cure
Chelan
*NL*
and
confessed
to
him
her
plan
of
marrying
Julien
.
The
cure
was
truly
*NL*
rejoiced
at
his
friend
's
good
fortune
,
but
he
was
extremely
surprised
*NL*
when
Julien
resolutely
informed
him
that
Mademoiselle
Elisa
's
offer
*NL*
could
not
suit
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beware
,
my
friend
,
of
what
is
passing
within
your
heart
,
''
said
the
*NL*
cure
with
a
frown
,
``
I
congratulate
you
on
your
mission
,
if
that
is
the
*NL*
only
reason
why
you
despise
a
more
than
ample
fortune
.
It
is
fifty-six
*NL*
years
since
I
was
first
cure
of
Verrieres
,
and
yet
I
shall
be
turned
*NL*
out
,
according
to
all
appearances
.
I
am
distressed
by
it
,
and
yet
my
*NL*
income
amounts
to
eight
hundred
francs
.
I
inform
you
of
this
detail
so
*NL*
that
you
may
not
be
under
any
illusions
as
to
what
awaits
you
in
your
*NL*
career
as
a
priest
.
If
you
think
of
paying
court
to
the
men
who
enjoy
*NL*
power
,
your
eternal
damnation
is
assured
.
You
may
make
your
fortune
,
*NL*
but
you
will
have
to
do
harm
to
the
poor
,
flatter
the
sub-prefect
,
*NL*
the
mayor
,
the
man
who
enjoys
prestige
,
and
pander
to
his
passion
;
*NL*
this
conduct
,
which
in
the
world
is
called
knowledge
of
life
,
is
not
*NL*
absolutely
incompatible
with
salvation
so
far
as
a
layman
is
concerned
;
*NL*
but
in
our
career
we
have
to
make
a
choice
;
it
is
a
question
of
making
*NL*
one
's
fortune
either
in
this
world
or
the
next
;
there
is
no
middle
*NL*
course
.
Come
,
my
dear
friend
,
reflect
,
and
come
back
in
three
days
with
*NL*
a
definite
answer
.
I
am
pained
to
detect
that
there
is
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
your
character
a
sombre
passion
which
is
far
from
indicating
to
me
*NL*
that
moderation
and
that
perfect
renunciation
of
earthly
advantages
so
*NL*
necessary
for
a
priest
;
I
augur
well
of
your
intellect
,
but
allow
me
to
*NL*
tell
you
,
''
added
the
good
cure
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
``
I
tremble
for
*NL*
your
salvation
in
your
career
as
a
priest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
ashamed
of
his
emotion
;
he
found
himself
loved
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
his
life
;
he
wept
with
delight
;
and
went
to
hide
his
tears
in
*NL*
the
great
woods
behind
Verrieres
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
am
I
in
this
position
?
''
he
said
to
himself
at
last
,
``
I
feel
that
*NL*
I
would
give
my
life
a
hundred
times
over
for
this
good
cure
Chelan
,
*NL*
and
he
has
just
proved
to
me
that
I
am
nothing
more
than
a
fool
.
It
*NL*
is
especially
necessary
for
me
to
deceive
him
,
and
he
manages
to
find
*NL*
me
out
.
The
secret
ardour
which
he
refers
to
is
my
plan
of
making
my
*NL*
fortune
.
He
thinks
I
am
unworthy
of
being
a
priest
,
that
too
,
just
when
*NL*
I
was
imagining
that
my
sacrifice
of
fifty
louis
would
give
him
the

very

idea
of
my
piety
and
devotion
to
my

``
I
will
only
reckon
on
those
elements
in
*NL*
my
character
which
I
have
tested
.
Who
could
have
told
me
that
I
should
*NL*
find
any
pleasure
in
shedding
tears
?
How
I
should
like
some
one
to
*NL*
convince
me
that
I
am
simply
a
fool
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
later
,
Julien
found
the
excuse
with
which
he
ought
to
have
*NL*
been
prepared
on
the
first
day
;
the
excuse
was
a
piece
of
calumny
,
but
*NL*
what
did
it
matter
?
He
confessed
to
the
cure
,
with
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
hesitation
,
that
he
had
been
persuaded
from
the
suggested
union
by
a
*NL*
reason
he
could
not
explain
,
inasmuch
as
it
tended
to
damage
a
third
*NL*
party
.
This
was
equivalent
to
impeaching
Elisa
's
conduct
.
M.
Chelan
*NL*
found
that
his
manner
betrayed
a
certain
worldly
fire
which
was
very
*NL*
different
from
that
which
ought
to
have
animated
a
young
acolyte
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
''
he
said
to
him
again
,
``
be
a
good
country
citizen
,
*NL*
respected
and
educated
,
rather
than
a
priest
without
a
true
mission
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
as
words
were
concerned
,
Julien
answered
these
new
remonstrances
*NL*
very
well
.
He
managed
to
find
the
words
which
a
young
and
ardent
*NL*
seminarist
would
have
employed
,
but
the
tone
in
which
he
pronounced
*NL*
them
,
together
with
the
thinly
concealed
fire
which
blazed
in
his
eye
,
*NL*
alarmed
M.
Chelan
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
must
not
have
too
bad
an
opinion
of
Julien
's
prospects
.
He
*NL*
invented
with
correctness
all
the
words
suitable
to
a
prudent
and
*NL*
cunning
hypocrisy
.
It
was
not
bad
for
his
age
.
As
for
his
tone
and
his
*NL*
gestures
,
he
had
spent
his
life
with
country
people
;
he
had
never
been
*NL*
given
an
opportunity
of
seeing
great
models
.
Consequently
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
was
given
a
chance
of
getting
near
such
gentlemen
,
his
gestures
*NL*
became
as
admirable
as
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
astonished
that
her
maid
's
new
fortune
did
not
*NL*
make
her
more
happy
.
She
saw
her
repeatedly
going
to
the
cure
and
*NL*
coming
back
with
tears
in
her
eyes
.
At
last
Elisa
talked
to
her
of
her
*NL*
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
thought
she
was
ill
.
A
kind
of
fever
prevented
her
from
*NL*
sleeping
.
She
only
lived
when
either
her
maid
or
Julien
were
in
sight
.
*NL*
She
was
unable
to
think
of
anything
except
them
and
the
happiness
*NL*
which
they
would
find
in
their
home
.
Her
imagination
depicted
in
the
*NL*
most
fascinating
colours
the
poverty
of
the
little
house
,
where
they
*NL*
were
to
live
on
their
income
of
fifty
louis
a
year
.
Julien
could
quite
*NL*
well
become
an
advocate
at
Bray
,
the
sub-prefecture
,
two
leagues
from
*NL*
Verrieres
.
In
that
case
she
would
see
him
sometimes
.
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
sincerely
believed
she
would
go
mad
.
She
said
so
to
her
husband
and
*NL*
finally
fell
ill
.
That
very
evening
when
her
maid
was
attending
her
,
*NL*
she
noticed
that
the
girl
was
crying
.
She
abhorred
Elisa
at
that
*NL*
moment
,
and
started
to
scold
her
;
she
then
begged
her
pardon
.
Elisa
's
*NL*
tears
redoubled
.
She
said
if
her
mistress
would
allow
her
,
she
would
*NL*
tell
her
all
her
unhappiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
''
answered
Madame
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Madame
,
he
refuses
me
,
some
wicked
people
must
have
spoken
badly
*NL*
about
me
.
He
believes
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
refuses
you
?
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
,
scarcely
breathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
else
,
Madame
,
but
M.
Julien
,
''
answered
the
maid
sobbing
.
``
M.
the
*NL*
cure
had
been
unable
to
overcome
his
resistance
,
for
M.
the
cure
thinks
*NL*
that
he
ought
not
to
refuse
an
honest
girl
on
the
pretext
that
she
*NL*
has
been
a
maid
.
After
all
,
M.
Julien
's
father
is
nothing
more
than
*NL*
a
carpenter
,
and
how
did
he
himself
earn
his
living
before
he
was
at
*NL*
Madame
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
stopped
listening
;
her
excessive
happiness
had
almost
*NL*
deprived
her
of
her
reason
.
She
made
the
girl
repeat
several
times
*NL*
the
assurance
that
Julien
had
refused
her
,
with
a
positiveness
which
*NL*
shut
the
door
on
the
possibility
of
his
coming
round
to
a
more
prudent
*NL*
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
make
a
last
attempt
,
''
she
said
to
her
maid
.
``
I
will
speak
to
M.
*NL*
Julien
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
day
,
after
breakfast
,
Madame
de
Renal
indulged
in
the
*NL*
delightful
luxury
of
pleading
her
rival
's
cause
,
and
of
seeing
Elisa
's
*NL*
hand
and
fortune
stubbornly
refused
for
a
whole
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
gradually
emerged
from
his
cautiously
worded
answers
,
and
*NL*
finished
by
answering
with
spirit
Madame
de
Renal
's
good
advice
.
She
*NL*
could
not
help
being
overcome
by
the
torrent
of
happiness
which
,
after
*NL*
so
many
days
of
despair
,
now
inundated
her
soul
.
She
felt
quite
ill
.
*NL*
When
she
had
recovered
and
was
comfortably
in
her
own
room
she
sent
*NL*
everyone
away
.
She
was
profoundly
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
be
in
love
with
Julien
?
''
she
finally
said
to
herself
.
This
*NL*
discovery
,
which
at
any
other
time
would
have
plunged
her
into
remorse
*NL*
and
the
deepest
agitation
,
now
only
produced
the
effect
of
a
singular
,
*NL*
but
as
it
were
,
indifferent
spectacle
.
Her
soul
was
exhausted
by
all
*NL*
that
she
had
just
gone
through
,
and
had
no
more
sensibility
to
passion
*NL*
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
tried
to
work
,
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
;
when
she
*NL*
woke
up
she
did
not
frighten
herself
so
much
as
she
ought
to
have
.
She
*NL*
was
too
happy
to
be
able
to
see
anything
wrong
in
anything
.
Naive
and
*NL*
innocent
as
she
was
,
this
worthy
provincial
woman
had
never
tortured
*NL*
her
soul
in
her
endeavours
to
extract
from
it
a
little
sensibility
to
*NL*
some
new
shade
of
sentiment
or
unhappiness
.
Entirely
absorbed
as
she
*NL*
had
been
before
Julien
's
arrival
with
that
mass
of
work
which
falls
*NL*
to
the
lot
of
a
good
mistress
of
a
household
away
from
Paris
,
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
thought
of
passion
in
the
same
way
in
which
we
think
of
a
*NL*
lottery
:
a
certain
deception
,
a
happiness
sought
after
by
fools
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
bell
rang
.
Madame
de
Renal
blushed
violently
.
She
heard
the
*NL*
voice
of
Julien
who
was
bringing
in
the
children
.
Having
grown
somewhat
*NL*
adroit
since
her
falling
in
love
,
she
complained
of
an
awful
headache
*NL*
in
order
to
explain
her
redness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
like
what
all
women
are
,
''
answered
M.
de
Renal
with
a
*NL*
coarse
laugh
.
``
Those
machines
have
always
got
something
or
other
to
be
*NL*
put
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
she
was
accustomed
to
this
type
of
wit
,
Madame
de
Renal
was
*NL*
shocked
by
the
tone
of
voice
.
In
order
to
distract
herself
,
she
looked
*NL*
at
Julien
's
physiognomy
;
he
would
have
pleased
her
at
this
particular
*NL*
moment
,
even
if
he
had
been
the
ugliest
man
imaginable
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
,
who
always
made
a
point
of
copying
the
habits
of
the
*NL*
gentry
of
the
court
,
established
himself
at
Vergy
in
the
first
fine
*NL*
days
of
the
spring
;
this
is
the
village
rendered
celebrated
by
the
*NL*
tragic
adventure
of
Gabrielle
.
A
hundred
paces
from
the
picturesque
*NL*
ruin
of
the
old
Gothic
church
,
M.
de
Renal
owns
an
old
chateau
with
its
*NL*
four
towers
and
a
garden
designed
like
the
one
in
the
Tuileries
with
*NL*
a
great
many
edging
verges
of
box
and
avenues
of
chestnut
trees
which
*NL*
are
cut
twice
in
the
year
.
An
adjacent
field
,
crowded
with
apple
trees
,
*NL*
served
for
a
promenade
.
Eight
or
ten
magnificent
walnut
trees
were
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
orchard
.
Their
immense
foliage
went
as
high
as
perhaps
*NL*
eighty
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Each
of
these
cursed
walnut
trees
,
''
M.
de
Renal
was
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
saying
,
whenever
his
wife
admired
them
,
``
costs
me
the
harvest
of
at
*NL*
least
half
an
acre
;
corn
can
not
grow
under
their
shade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
found
the
sight
of
the
country
novel
:
her
admiration
*NL*
reached
the
point
of
enthusiasm
.
The
sentiment
by
which
she
was
*NL*
animated
gave
her
both
ideas
and
resolution
.
M.
de
Renal
had
returned
*NL*
to
the
town
,
for
mayoral
business
,
two
days
after
their
arrival
in
*NL*
Vergy
.
But
Madame
de
Renal
engaged
workmen
at
her
own
expense
.
Julien
*NL*
had
given
her
the
idea
of
a
little
sanded
path
which
was
to
go
round
*NL*
the
orchard
and
under
the
big
walnut
trees
,
and
render
it
possible
*NL*
for
the
children
to
take
their
walk
in
the
very
earliest
hours
of
the
*NL*
morning
without
getting
their
feet
wet
from
the
dew
.
This
idea
was
put
*NL*
into
execution
within
twenty-four
hours
of
its
being
conceived
.
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
gaily
spent
the
whole
day
with
Julien
in
supervising
the
*NL*
workmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Mayor
of
Verrieres
came
back
from
the
town
he
was
very
*NL*
surprised
to
find
the
avenue
completed
.
His
arrival
surprised
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
as
well
.
She
had
forgotten
his
existence
.
For
two
months
*NL*
he
talked
with
irritation
about
the
boldness
involved
in
making
so
*NL*
important
a
repair
without
consulting
him
,
but
Madame
de
Renal
had
had
*NL*
it
executed
at
her
own
expense
,
a
fact
which
somewhat
consoled
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
spent
her
days
in
running
about
the
orchard
with
her
children
,
*NL*
and
in
catching
butterflies
.
They
had
made
big
hoods
of
clear
gauze
*NL*
with
which
they
caught
the
poor
_
lepidoptera
_
.
This
is
the
barbarous
*NL*
name
which
Julien
taught
Madame
de
Renal
.
For
she
had
had
M.
Godart
's
*NL*
fine
work
ordered
from
Besancon
,
and
Julien
used
to
tell
her
about
the
*NL*
strange
habits
of
the
creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
ruthlessly
transfixed
them
by
means
of
pins
in
a
great
cardboard
*NL*
box
which
Julien
had
prepared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
and
Julien
had
at
last
a
topic
of
conversation
;
he
was
*NL*
no
longer
exposed
to
the
awful
torture
that
had
been
occasioned
by
*NL*
their
moments
of
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
incessantly
and
with
extreme
interest
,
though
always
about
*NL*
very
innocent
matters
.
This
gay
,
full
,
active
life
,
pleased
the
fancy
*NL*
of
everyone
,
except
Mademoiselle
Elisa
who
found
herself
overworked
.
*NL*
Madame
had
never
taken
so
much
trouble
with
her
dress
,
even
at
carnival
*NL*
time
,
when
there
is
a
ball
at
Verrieres
,
she
would
say
;
she
changes
her
*NL*
gowns
two
or
three
times
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
is
not
our
intention
to
flatter
anyone
,
we
do
not
propose
to
*NL*
deny
that
Madame
de
Renal
,
who
had
a
superb
skin
,
arranged
her
gowns
*NL*
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
her
arms
and
her
bosom
very
exposed
.
She
was
*NL*
extremely
well
made
,
and
this
style
of
dress
suited
her
delightfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
never
been
_
so
young
_
,
Madame
,
''
her
Verrieres
friends
would
*NL*
say
to
her
,
when
they
came
to
dinner
at
Vergy
-LRB-
this
is
one
of
the
local
*NL*
expressions
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
singular
thing
,
and
one
which
few
amongst
us
will
believe
,
but
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
had
no
specific
object
in
taking
so
much
trouble
.
She
*NL*
found
pleasure
in
it
and
spent
all
the
time
which
she
did
not
pass
in
*NL*
hunting
butterflies
with
the
children
and
Julien
,
in
working
with
Elisa
*NL*
at
making
gowns
,
without
giving
the
matter
a
further
thought
.
Her
only
*NL*
expedition
to
Verrieres
was
caused
by
her
desire
to
buy
some
new
summer
*NL*
gowns
which
had
just
come
from
Mulhouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
brought
back
to
Vergy
a
young
woman
who
was
a
relative
of
hers
.
*NL*
Since
her
marriage
,
Madame
de
Renal
had
gradually
become
attached
to
*NL*
Madame
Derville
,
who
had
once
been
her
school
mate
at
the
_
Sacre
Coeur
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Derville
laughed
a
great
deal
at
what
she
called
her
cousin
's
*NL*
mad
ideas
:
``
I
would
never
have
thought
of
them
alone
,
''
she
said
.
When
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
with
her
husband
,
she
was
ashamed
of
those
sudden
*NL*
ideas
,
which
,
are
called
sallies
in
Paris
,
and
thought
them
quite
*NL*
silly
:
but
Madame
Derville
's
presence
gave
her
courage
.
She
would
start
*NL*
to
telling
her
her
thoughts
in
a
timid
voice
,
but
after
the
ladies
*NL*
had
been
alone
for
a
long
time
,
Madame
de
Renal
's
brain
became
more
*NL*
animated
,
and
a
long
morning
spent
together
by
the
two
friends
passed
*NL*
like
a
second
,
and
left
them
in
the
best
of
spirits
.
On
this
particular
*NL*
journey
,
however
,
the
acute
Madame
Derville
thought
her
cousin
much
*NL*
less
merry
,
but
much
more
happy
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
,
on
his
side
,
had
since
coming
to
the
country
lived
like
an
*NL*
absolute
child
,
and
been
as
happy
as
his
pupils
in
running
after
*NL*
the
butterflies
.
After
so
long
a
period
of
constraint
and
wary
*NL*
diplomacy
,
he
was
at
last
alone
and
far
from
human
observation
;
he
*NL*
was
instinctively
free
from
any
apprehension
on
the
score
of
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
,
and
abandoned
himself
to
the
sheer
pleasure
of
being
alive
,
*NL*
which
is
so
keen
at
so
young
an
age
,
especially
among
the
most
*NL*
beautiful
mountains
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ever
since
Madame
Derville
's
arrival
,
Julien
thought
that
she
was
his
*NL*
friend
;
he
took
the
first
opportunity
of
showing
her
the
view
from
the
*NL*
end
of
the
new
avenue
,
under
the
walnut
tree
;
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
*NL*
equal
,
if
not
superior
,
to
the
most
wonderful
views
that
Switzerland
*NL*
and
the
Italian
lakes
can
offer
.
If
you
ascend
the
steep
slope
which
*NL*
commences
some
paces
from
there
,
you
soon
arrive
at
great
precipices
*NL*
fringed
by
oak
forests
,
which
almost
jut
on
to
the
river
.
It
was
to
the
*NL*
peaked
summits
of
these
rocks
that
Julien
,
who
was
now
happy
,
free
,
and
*NL*
king
of
the
household
into
the
bargain
,
would
take
the
two
friends
,
and
*NL*
enjoy
their
admiration
these
sublime
views
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
me
it
's
like
Mozart
's
music
,
''
Madame
Derville
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
country
around
Verrieres
had
been
spoilt
for
Julien
by
the
jealousy
*NL*
of
his
brothers
and
the
presence
of
a
tyranous
and
angry
father
.
He
*NL*
was
free
from
these
bitter
memories
at
Vergy
;
for
the
first
time
in
*NL*
his
life
,
he
failed
to
see
an
enemy
.
When
,
as
frequently
happened
,
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
was
in
town
,
he
ventured
to
read
;
soon
,
instead
of
reading
at
*NL*
night
time
,
a
procedure
,
moreover
,
which
involved
carefully
hiding
his
*NL*
lamp
at
the
bottom
of
a
flower-pot
turned
upside
down
,
he
was
able
to
*NL*
indulge
in
sleep
;
in
the
day
,
however
,
in
the
intervals
between
the
*NL*
children
's
lessons
,
he
would
come
among
these
rocks
with
that
book
*NL*
which
was
the
one
guide
of
his
conduct
and
object
of
his
enthusiasm
.
He
*NL*
found
in
it
simultaneously
happiness
,
ecstasy
and
consolation
for
his
*NL*
moments
of
discouragement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
remarks
of
Napoleon
about
women
,
several
discussions
about
the
*NL*
merits
of
the
novels
which
were
fashionable
in
his
reign
,
furnished
him
*NL*
now
for
the
first
time
with
some
ideas
which
any
other
young
man
of
his
*NL*
age
would
have
had
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog
days
arrived
.
They
started
the
habit
of
spending
the
evenings
*NL*
under
an
immense
pine
tree
some
yards
from
the
house
.
The
darkness
was
*NL*
profound
.
One
evening
,
Julien
was
speaking
and
gesticulating
,
enjoying
*NL*
to
the
full
the
pleasure
of
being
at
his
best
when
talking
to
young
*NL*
women
;
in
one
of
his
gestures
,
he
touched
the
hand
of
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
which
was
leaning
on
the
back
of
one
of
those
chairs
of
painted
wood
,
*NL*
which
are
so
frequently
to
be
seen
in
gardens
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hand
was
quickly
removed
,
but
Julien
thought
it
a
point
of
duty
*NL*
to
secure
that
that
hand
should
not
be
removed
when
he
touched
it
.
*NL*
The
idea
of
a
duty
to
be
performed
and
the
consciousness
of
his
*NL*
stultification
,
or
rather
of
his
social
inferiority
,
if
he
should
fail
*NL*
in
achieving
it
,
immediately
banished
all
pleasure
from
his
heart
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
AN
EVENING
IN
THE
COUNTRY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Guerin
's
Dido
,
a
charming
sketch
!
--
_
Strombeck
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
expression
was
singular
when
he
saw
Madame
de
Renal
the
next
*NL*
day
;
he
watched
her
like
an
enemy
with
whom
he
would
have
to
fight
a
*NL*
duel
.
These
looks
,
which
were
so
different
from
those
of
the
previous
*NL*
evening
,
made
Madame
de
Renal
lose
her
head
;
she
had
been
kind
to
him
*NL*
and
he
appeared
angry
.
She
could
not
take
her
eyes
off
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Derville
's
presence
allowed
Julien
to
devote
less
time
to
*NL*
conversation
,
and
more
time
to
thinking
about
what
he
had
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
His
one
object
all
this
day
was
to
fortify
himself
by
reading
the
*NL*
inspired
book
that
gave
strength
to
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
considerably
curtailed
the
children
's
lessons
,
and
when
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
's
presence
had
effectually
brought
him
back
to
the
pursuit
of
his
*NL*
ambition
,
he
decided
that
she
absolutely
must
allow
her
hand
to
rest
in
*NL*
his
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
setting
of
the
sun
which
brought
the
crucial
moment
nearer
and
*NL*
nearer
made
Julien
's
heart
beat
in
a
strange
way
.
Night
came
.
He
*NL*
noticed
with
a
joy
,
which
took
an
immense
weight
off
his
heart
,
that
*NL*
it
was
going
to
be
very
dark
.
The
sky
,
which
was
laden
with
big
clouds
*NL*
that
had
been
brought
along
by
a
sultry
wind
,
seemed
to
herald
a
storm
.
*NL*
The
two
friends
went
for
their
walk
very
late
.
All
they
did
that
night
*NL*
struck
Julien
as
strange
.
They
were
enjoying
that
hour
which
seems
to
*NL*
give
certain
refined
souls
an
increased
pleasure
in
loving
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
they
sat
down
,
Madame
de
Renal
beside
Julien
,
and
Madame
*NL*
Derville
near
her
friend
.
Engrossed
as
he
was
by
the
attempt
which
*NL*
he
was
going
to
make
,
Julien
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
.
The
*NL*
conversation
languished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
be
as
nervous
and
miserable
over
my
first
duel
?
''
said
Julien
*NL*
to
himself
;
for
he
was
too
suspicious
both
of
himself
and
of
others
,
*NL*
not
to
realise
his
own
mental
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
mortal
anguish
,
he
would
have
preferred
any
danger
whatsoever
.
*NL*
How
many
times
did
he
not
wish
some
matter
to
crop
up
which
would
*NL*
necessitate
Madame
de
Renal
going
into
the
house
and
leaving
the
*NL*
garden
!
The
violent
strain
on
Julien
's
nerves
was
too
great
for
his
*NL*
voice
not
to
be
considerably
changed
;
soon
Madame
de
Renal
's
voice
*NL*
became
nervous
as
well
,
but
Julien
did
not
notice
it
.
The
awful
battle
*NL*
raging
between
duty
and
timidity
was
too
painful
,
for
him
to
be
in
a
*NL*
position
to
observe
anything
outside
himself
.
A
quarter
to
ten
had
*NL*
just
struck
on
the
chateau
clock
without
his
having
ventured
anything
.
*NL*
Julien
was
indignant
at
his
own
cowardice
,
and
said
to
himself
,
``
at
*NL*
the
exact
moment
when
ten
o'clock
strikes
,
I
will
perform
what
I
have
*NL*
resolved
to
do
all
through
the
day
,
or
I
will
go
up
to
my
room
and
blow
*NL*
out
my
brains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
final
moment
of
expectation
and
anxiety
,
during
which
Julien
*NL*
was
rendered
almost
beside
himself
by
his
excessive
emotion
,
ten
*NL*
o'clock
struck
from
the
clock
over
his
head
.
Each
stroke
of
the
fatal
*NL*
clock
reverberated
in
his
bosom
,
and
caused
an
almost
physical
pang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
when
the
last
stroke
of
ten
was
still
reverberating
,
he
*NL*
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
Madame
de
Renal
's
,
who
immediately
*NL*
withdrew
it
.
Julien
,
scarcely
knowing
what
he
was
doing
,
seized
it
*NL*
again
.
In
spite
of
his
own
excitement
,
he
could
not
help
being
struck
*NL*
by
the
icy
coldness
of
the
hand
which
he
was
taking
;
he
pressed
it
*NL*
convulsively
;
a
last
effort
was
made
to
take
it
away
,
but
in
the
end
*NL*
the
hand
remained
in
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
soul
was
inundated
with
happiness
,
not
that
he
loved
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
,
but
an
awful
torture
had
just
ended
.
He
thought
it
necessary
*NL*
to
say
something
,
to
avoid
Madame
Derville
noticing
anything
.
His
*NL*
voice
was
now
strong
and
ringing
.
Madame
de
Renal
's
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
betrayed
so
much
emotion
that
her
friend
thought
she
was
ill
,
and
*NL*
suggested
her
going
in
.
Julien
scented
danger
,
``
if
Madame
de
Renal
goes
*NL*
back
to
the
salon
,
I
shall
relapse
into
the
awful
state
in
which
I
have
*NL*
been
all
day
.
I
have
held
the
hand
far
too
short
a
time
for
it
really
*NL*
to
count
as
the
scoring
of
an
actual
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
Madame
Derville
was
repeating
her
suggestion
to
*NL*
go
back
to
the
salon
,
Julien
squeezed
vigorously
the
hand
that
was
*NL*
abandoned
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
,
who
had
started
to
get
up
,
sat
down
again
and
said
in
*NL*
a
faint
voice
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
a
little
ill
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
but
the
open
air
is
doing
me
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
confirmed
Julien
's
happiness
,
which
at
the
present
moment
*NL*
was
extreme
;
he
spoke
,
he
forgot
to
pose
,
and
appeared
the
most
*NL*
charming
man
in
the
world
to
the
two
friends
who
were
listening
to
him
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
there
was
a
slight
lack
of
courage
in
all
this
eloquence
*NL*
which
had
suddenly
come
upon
him
.
He
was
mortally
afraid
that
Madame
*NL*
Derville
would
get
tired
of
the
wind
before
the
storm
,
which
was
*NL*
beginning
to
rise
,
and
want
to
go
back
alone
into
the
salon
.
He
would
*NL*
then
have
remained
_
tete-a-tete
_
with
Madame
de
Renal
.
He
had
had
,
*NL*
almost
by
accident
that
blind
courage
which
is
sufficient
for
action
;
*NL*
but
he
felt
that
it
was
out
of
his
power
to
speak
the
simplest
word
to
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
.
He
was
certain
that
,
however
slight
her
reproaches
*NL*
might
be
,
he
would
nevertheless
be
worsted
,
and
that
the
advantage
he
*NL*
had
just
won
would
be
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Luckily
for
him
on
this
evening
,
his
moving
and
emphatic
speeches
found
*NL*
favour
with
Madame
Derville
,
who
very
often
found
him
as
clumsy
as
a
*NL*
child
and
not
at
all
amusing
.
As
for
Madame
de
Renal
,
with
her
hand
in
*NL*
Julien
's
,
she
did
not
have
a
thought
;
she
simply
allowed
herself
to
go
*NL*
on
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hours
spent
under
this
great
pine
tree
,
planted
by
by
Charles
the
*NL*
Bold
according
to
the
local
tradition
,
were
a
real
period
of
happiness
.
*NL*
She
listened
with
delight
to
the
soughing
of
the
wind
in
the
thick
*NL*
foliage
of
the
pine
tree
and
to
the
noise
of
some
stray
drops
which
*NL*
were
beginning
to
fall
upon
the
leaves
which
were
lowest
down
.
Julien
*NL*
failed
to
notice
one
circumstance
which
,
if
he
had
,
would
have
quickly
*NL*
reassured
him
;
Madame
de
Renal
,
who
had
been
obliged
to
take
away
her
*NL*
hand
,
because
she
had
got
up
to
help
her
cousin
to
pick
up
a
flower-pot
*NL*
which
the
wind
had
knocked
over
at
her
feet
,
had
scarcely
sat
down
*NL*
again
before
she
gave
him
her
hand
with
scarcely
any
difficulty
and
as
*NL*
though
it
had
already
been
a
pre-arranged
thing
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Midnight
had
struck
a
long
time
ago
;
it
was
at
last
necessary
to
leave
*NL*
the
garden
;
they
separated
.
Madame
de
Renal
swept
away
as
she
was
,
by
*NL*
the
happiness
of
loving
,
was
so
completely
ignorant
of
the
world
that
*NL*
she
scarcely
reproached
herself
at
all
.
Her
happiness
deprived
her
of
*NL*
her
sleep
.
A
leaden
sleep
overwhelmed
Julien
who
was
mortally
fatigued
*NL*
by
the
battle
which
timidity
and
pride
had
waged
in
his
heart
all
*NL*
through
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
called
at
five
o'clock
on
the
following
day
and
scarcely
gave
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
a
single
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
accomplished
his
duty
,
and
a
heroic
duty
too
.
The
consciousness
*NL*
of
this
filled
him
with
happiness
;
he
locked
himself
in
his
room
,
and
*NL*
abandoned
himself
with
quite
a
new
pleasure
to
reading
exploits
of
his
*NL*
hero
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
breakfast
bell
sounded
,
the
reading
of
the
Bulletins
of
the
*NL*
Great
Army
had
made
him
forget
all
his
advantages
of
the
previous
day
.
*NL*
He
said
to
himself
flippantly
,
as
he
went
down
to
the
salon
,
``
I
must
*NL*
tell
that
woman
that
I
am
in
love
with
her
.
''
Instead
of
those
looks
*NL*
brimful
of
pleasure
which
he
was
expecting
to
meet
,
he
found
the
stern
*NL*
visage
of
M.
de
Renal
,
who
had
arrived
from
Verrieres
two
hours
ago
,
*NL*
and
did
not
conceal
his
dissatisfaction
at
Julien
's
having
passed
the
*NL*
whole
morning
without
attending
to
the
children
.
Nothing
could
have
*NL*
been
more
sordid
than
this
self-important
man
when
he
was
in
a
bad
*NL*
temper
and
thought
that
he
could
safely
show
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
harsh
word
of
her
husband
pierced
Madame
de
Renal
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Julien
,
he
was
so
plunged
in
his
ecstasy
,
and
still
so
engrossed
*NL*
by
the
great
events
which
had
been
passing
before
his
eyes
for
several
*NL*
hours
,
that
he
had
some
difficulty
at
first
in
bringing
his
attention
*NL*
sufficiently
down
to
listen
to
the
harsh
remarks
which
M.
de
Renal
was
*NL*
addressing
to
him
.
He
said
to
him
at
last
,
rather
abruptly
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
of
this
answer
would
have
stung
a
much
less
sensitive
man
than
*NL*
the
mayor
of
Verrieres
.
He
half
thought
of
answering
Julien
by
turning
*NL*
him
out
of
the
house
straight
away
.
He
was
only
restrained
by
the
*NL*
maxim
which
he
had
prescribed
for
himself
,
of
never
hurrying
unduly
in
*NL*
business
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
fool
,
''
he
said
to
himself
shortly
afterwards
,
``
has
won
a
*NL*
kind
of
reputation
in
my
house
.
That
man
Valenod
may
take
him
into
his
*NL*
family
,
or
he
may
quite
well
marry
Elisa
,
and
in
either
case
,
he
will
*NL*
be
able
to
have
the
laugh
of
me
in
his
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
wisdom
of
these
reflections
,
M.
de
Renal
's
*NL*
dissatisfaction
did
not
fail
to
vent
itself
any
the
less
by
a
string
*NL*
of
coarse
insults
which
gradually
irritated
Julien
.
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
was
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
tears
.

was
scarcely
over
,
*NL*
when
she
asked
Julien
to
give
her
his
arm
for
a
walk
.
She
leaned
on
him
*NL*
affectionately
.
Julien
could
only
answer
all
that
Madame
de
Renal
said
*NL*
to
him
by
whispering
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
That
's
what
rich
people
are
like
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
was
walking
quite
close
to
them
;
his
presence
increased
*NL*
Julien
's
anger
.
He
suddenly
noticed
that
Madame
de
Renal
was
leaning
on
*NL*
his
arm
in
a
manner
which
was
somewhat
marked
.
This
horrified
him
,
and
*NL*
he
pushed
her
violently
away
and
disengaged
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Luckily
,
M.
de
Renal
did
not
see
this
new
piece
of
impertinence
;
it
was
*NL*
only
noticed
by
Madame
Derville
.
Her
friend
burst
into
tears
.
M.
de
*NL*
Renal
now
started
to
chase
away
by
a
shower
of
stones
a
little
peasant
*NL*
girl
who
had
taken
a
private
path
crossing
a
corner
of
the
orchard
.
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Julien
,
restrain
yourself
,
I
pray
you
.
Remember
that
we
all
*NL*
have
our
moments
of
temper
,
''
said
madame
Derville
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
looked
at
her
coldly
with
eyes
in
which
the
most
supreme
*NL*
contempt
was
depicted
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
look
astonished
Madame
Derville
,
and
it
would
have
surprised
*NL*
her
even
more
if
she
had
appreciated
its
real
expression
;
she
would
*NL*
have
read
in
it
something
like
a
vague
hope
of
the
most
atrocious
*NL*
vengeance
.
It
is
,
no
doubt
,
such
moments
of
humiliation
which
have
made
*NL*
Robespierres
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Julien
is
very
violent
;
he
frightens
me
,
''
said
Madame
Derville
to
*NL*
her
friend
,
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
right
to
be
angry
,
''
she
answered
.
``
What
does
it
matter
if
*NL*
he
does
pass
a
morning
without
speaking
to
the
children
,
after
the
*NL*
astonishing
progress
which
he
has
made
them
make
.
One
must
admit
that
*NL*
men
are
very
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
Madame
de
Renal
experienced
a
kind
*NL*
of
desire
for
vengeance
against
her
husband
.
The
extreme
hatred
of
*NL*
the
rich
by
which
Julien
was
animated
was
on
the
point
of
exploding
.
*NL*
Luckily
,
M.
de
Renal
called
his
gardener
,
and
remained
occupied
*NL*
with
him
in
barring
by
faggots
of
thorns
the
private
road
through
*NL*
the
orchard
.
Julien
did
not
vouchsafe
any
answer
to
the
kindly
*NL*
consideration
of
which
he
was
the
object
during
all
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
walk
.
M.
de
Renal
had
scarcely
gone
away
before
the
two
friends
made
*NL*
the
excuse
of
being
fatigued
,
and
each
asked
him
for
an
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Walking
as
he
did
between
these
two
women
whose
extreme
nervousness
*NL*
filled
their
cheeks
with
a
blushing
embarrassment
,
the
haughty
pallor
*NL*
and
sombre
,
resolute
air
of
Julien
formed
a
strange
contrast
.
He
*NL*
despised
these
women
and
all
tender
sentiments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
not
even
an
income
of
five
hundred
francs
*NL*
to
finish
my
studies
!
Ah
!
how
I
should
like
to
send
them
packing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
absorbed
as
he
was
by
these
stern
ideas
,
such
few
courteous
words
*NL*
of
his
two
friends
as
he
deigned
to
take
the
trouble
to
understand
,
*NL*
displeased
him
as
devoid
of
sense
,
silly
,
feeble
,
in
a
word
--
feminine
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
result
of
speaking
for
the
sake
of
speaking
and
of
endeavouring
*NL*
to
keep
the
conversation
alive
,
it
came
about
that
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
mentioned
that
her
husband
had
come
from
Verrieres
because
he
had
made
*NL*
a
bargain
for
the
May
straw
with
one
of
his
farmers
.
-LRB-
In
this
district
*NL*
it
is
the
May
straw
with
which
the
bed
mattresses
are
filled
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
husband
will
not
rejoin
us
,
''
added
Madame
de
Renal
;
``
he
will
occupy
*NL*
himself
with
finishing
the
re-stuffing
of
the
house
mattresses
with
*NL*
the
help
of
the
gardener
and
his
valet
.
He
has
put
the
May
straw
this
*NL*
morning
in
all
the
beds
on
the
first
storey
;
he
is
now
at
the
second
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
changed
colour
.
He
looked
at
Madame
de
Renal
in
a
singular
way
,
*NL*
and
soon
managed
somehow
to
take
her
on
one
side
,
doubling
his
pace
.
*NL*
Madame
Derville
allowed
them
to
get
ahead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Save
my
life
,
''
said
Julien
to
Madame
de
Renal
;
``
only
you
can
do
it
,
*NL*
for
you
know
that
the
valet
hates
me
desperately
.
I
must
confess
to
*NL*
you
,
madame
,
that
I
have
a
portrait
.
I
have
hidden
it
in
the
mattress
*NL*
of
my
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
Madame
de
Renal
in
her
turn
became
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
you
,
Madame
,
are
able
at
this
moment
to
go
into
my
room
,
feel
*NL*
about
without
their
noticing
in
the
corner
of
the
mattress
;
it
*NL*
is
nearest
the
window
.
You
will
find
a
small
,
round
box
of
black
*NL*
cardboard
,
very
glossy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
contain
a
portrait
?
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
,
scarcely
able
to
*NL*
hold
herself
upright
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
noticed
her
air
of
discouragement
,
and
at
once
proceeded
to
*NL*
exploit
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
second
favour
to
ask
you
,
madame
.
I
entreat
you
not
to
look
*NL*
at
that
portrait
;
it
is
my
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
secret
,
''
repeated
Madame
de
Renal
in
a
faint
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
she
had
been
brought
up
among
people
who
are
proud
of
their
*NL*
fortune
and
appreciative
of
nothing
except
money
,
love
had
already
*NL*
instilled
generosity
into
her
soul
.
Truly
wounded
as
she
was
,
it
was
*NL*
with
an
air
of
the
most
simple
devotion
that
Madame
de
Renal
asked
*NL*
Julien
the
questions
necessary
to
enable
her
to
fulfil
her
commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
''
she
said
to
him
as
she
went
away
,
``
it
is
a
little
round
box
of
*NL*
black
cardboard
,
very
glossy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Madame
,
''
answered
Julien
,
with
that
hardness
which
danger
gives
*NL*
to
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
ascended
the
second
storey
of
the
chateau
as
pale
as
though
she
had
*NL*
been
going
to
her
death
.
Her
misery
was
completed
by
the
sensation
that
*NL*
she
was
on
the
verge
of
falling
ill
,
but
the
necessity
of
doing
Julien
*NL*
a
service
restored
her
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
have
that
box
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
as
she
doubled
her
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
her
husband
speaking
to
the
valet
in
Julien
's
very
room
.
*NL*
Happily
,
they
passed
into
the
children
's
room
.
She
lifted
up
the
*NL*
mattress
,
and
plunged
her
hand
into
the
stuffing
so
violently
that
she
*NL*
bruised
her
fingers
.
But
,
though
she
was
very
sensitive
to
slight
pain
*NL*
of
this
kind
,
she
was
not
conscious
of
it
now
,
for
she
felt
almost
*NL*
simultaneously
the
smooth
surface
of
the
cardboard
box
.
She
seized
it
*NL*
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
scarcely
recovered
from
the
fear
of
being
surprised
by
her
*NL*
husband
than
the
horror
with
which
this
box
inspired
her
came
within
an
*NL*
ace
of
positively
making
her
feel
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
Julien
is
in
love
,
and
I
hold
here
the
portrait
of
the
woman
whom
*NL*
he
loves
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seated
on
the
chair
in
the
ante-chamber
of
his
apartment
,
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
fell
a
prey
to
all
the
horrors
of
jealousy
.
Her
extreme
*NL*
ignorance
,
moreover
,
was
useful
to
her
at
this
juncture
;
her
*NL*
astonishment
mitigated
her
grief
.
Julien
seized
the
box
without
*NL*
thanking
her
or
saying
a
single
word
,
and
ran
into
his
room
,
where
*NL*
he
lit
a
fire
and
immediately
burnt
it
.
He
was
pale
and
in
a
state
*NL*
of
collapse
.
He
exaggerated
the
extent
of
the
danger
which
he
had
*NL*
undergone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finding
Napoleon
's
portrait
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
in
the
possession
*NL*
of
a
man
who
professes
so
great
a
hate
for
the
usurper
!
Found
,
too
,
*NL*
by
M.
de
Renal
,
who
is
so
great
an
_
ultra
_
,
and
is
now
in
a
state
of
*NL*
irritation
,
and
,
to
complete
my
imprudence
,
lines
written
in
my
own
*NL*
handwriting
on
the
white
cardboard
behind
the
portrait
,
lines
,
too
,
*NL*
which
can
leave
no
doubt
on
the
score
of
my
excessive
admiration
.
And
*NL*
each
of
these
transports
of
love
is
dated
.
There
was
one
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
my
reputation
collapsed
and
shattered
in
a
moment
,
''
said
Julien
*NL*
to
himself
as
he
watched
the
box
burn
,
``
and
my
reputation
is
my
only
*NL*
asset
.
It
is
all
I
have
to
live
by
--
and
what
a
life
to
,
by
heaven
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
afterwards
,
this
fatigue
,
together
with
the
pity
which
he
felt
*NL*
for
himself
made
him
inclined
to
be
more
tender
.
He
met
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
and
took
her
hand
,
which
he
kissed
with
more
sincerity
than
he
had
*NL*
ever
done
before
.
She
blushed
with
happiness
and
almost
simultaneously
*NL*
rebuffed
Julien
with
all
the
anger
of
jealousy
.
Julien
's
pride
which
*NL*
had
been
so
recently
wounded
made
him
act
foolishly
at
this
juncture
.
*NL*
He
saw
in
Madame
de
Renal
nothing
but
a
rich
woman
,
he
disdainfully
let
*NL*
her
hand
fall
and
went
away
.
He
went
and
walked
about
meditatively
in
*NL*
the
garden
.
Soon
a
bitter
smile
appeared
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
walking
about
as
serenely
as
a
man
who
is
master
of
his
own
*NL*
time
.
I
am
not
bothering
about
the
children
!
I
am
exposing
myself
to
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
's
humiliating
remarks
,
and
he
will
be
quite
right
.
''
He
ran
to
*NL*
the
children
's
room
.
The
caresses
of
the
youngest
child
,
whom
he
loved
*NL*
very
much
,
somewhat
calmed
his
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
not
despise
me
yet
,
''
thought
Julien
.
But
he
soon
reproached
*NL*
himself
for
this
alleviation
of
his
agony
as
though
it
were
a
new
*NL*
weakness
.
The
children
caress
me
just
in
the
same
way
in
which
they
*NL*
would
caress
the
young
hunting-hound
which
was
bought
yesterday

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
M.
De
Renal
was
going
through
all
the
rooms
in
the
chateau
,
and
he
came
*NL*
back
into
the
children
's
room
with
the
servants
who
were
bringing
back
*NL*
the
stuffings
of
the
mattresses
.
The
sudden
entry
of
this
man
had
the
*NL*
effect
on
Julien
of
the
drop
of
water
which
makes
the
pot
overflow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
paler
and
more
sinister
than
usual
,
he
rushed
towards
him
.
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
stopped
and
looked
at
his
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
Julien
to
him
,
``
Do
you
think
your
children
would
have
*NL*
made
the
progress
they
have
made
with
me
with
any
other
tutor
?
If
you
*NL*
answer
`
No
,
'
''
continued
Julien
so
quickly
that
M.
de
Renal
did
not
have
*NL*
time
to
speak
,
``
how
dare
you
reproach
me
with
neglecting
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
,
who
had
scarcely
recovered
from
his
fright
,
concluded
from
*NL*
the
strange
tone
he
saw
this
little
peasant
assume
,
that
he
had
some
*NL*
advantageous
offer
in
his
pocket
,
and
that
he
was
going
to
leave
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
he
spoke
the
more
Julien
's
anger
increased
,
``
I
can
live
*NL*
without
you
,
Monsieur
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
really
sorry
to
see
you
so
upset
,
''
answered
M.
de
Renal
*NL*
shuddering
a
little
.
The
servants
were
ten
yards
off
engaged
in
making
*NL*
the
beds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
what
I
mean
,
Monsieur
,
''
replied
Julien
quite
beside
*NL*
himself
.
``
Think
of
the
infamous
words
that
you
have
addressed
to
me
,
*NL*
and
before
women
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
understood
only
too
well
what
Julien
was
asking
,
and
a
*NL*
painful
conflict
tore
his
soul
.
It
happened
that
Julien
,
who
was
really
*NL*
mad
with
rage
,
cried
out
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
where
to
go
,
Monsieur
,
when
I
leave
your
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
M.
de
Renal
saw
Julien
installed
with
M.
Valenod
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
he
said
at
last
with
a
sigh
,
just
as
though
he
had
called
in
*NL*
a
surgeon
to
perform
the
most
painful
operation
,
``
I
accede
to
your
*NL*
request
.
I
will
give
you
fifty
francs
a
month
.
Starting
from
the
day
*NL*
after
to-morrow
which
is
the
first
of
the
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
wanted
to
laugh
,
and
stood
there
dumbfounded
.
All
his
anger
had
*NL*
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
despise
the
brute
enough
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
I
have
no
*NL*
doubt
that
that
is
the
greatest
apology
that
so
base
a
soul
can
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
who
had
listened
to
this
scene
with
gaping
mouths
,
ran
*NL*
into
the
garden
to
tell
their
mother
that
M.
Julien
was
very
angry
,
but
*NL*
that
he
was
going
to
have
fifty
francs
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
followed
them
as
a
matter
of
habit
without
even
looking
at
M.
de
*NL*
Renal
whom
he
left
in
a
considerable
state
of
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
makes
one
hundred
and
sixty-eight
francs
,
''
said
the
mayor
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
that
M.
Valenod
has
cost
me
.
I
must
absolutely
speak
a
few
*NL*
strong
words
to
him
about
his
contract
to
provide
for
the
foundlings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
afterwards
Julien
found
himself
opposite
M.
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
speak
to
M.
Chelan
on
a
matter
of
conscience
.
I
have
the
*NL*
honour
to
inform
you
that
I
shall
be
absent
some
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
dear
Julien
,
''
said
M.
de
Renal
smiling
with
the
falsest
*NL*
expression
possible
,
``
take
the
whole
day
,
and
to-morrow
too
if
you
*NL*
like
,
my
good
friend
.
Take
the
gardener
's
horse
to
go
to
Verrieres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
on
the
very
point
,
''
said
M.
de
Renal
to
himself
,
``
of
giving
an
*NL*
answer
to
Valenod
.
He
has
promised
me
nothing
,
but
I
must
let
this
*NL*
hot-headed
young
man
have
time
to
cool
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
quickly
went
away
,
and
went
up
into
the
great
forest
,
through
*NL*
which
one
can
manage
to
get
from
Vergy
to
Verrieres
.
He
did
not
wish
*NL*
to
arrive
at
M.
Chelan
's
at
once
.
Far
from
wishing
to
cramp
himself
in
*NL*
a
new
pose
of
hypocrisy
he
needed
to
see
clear
in
his
own
soul
,
and
to
*NL*
give
audience
to
the
crowd
of
sentiments
which
were
agitating
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
won
a
battle
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
he
*NL*
was
well
in
the
forest
,
and
far
from
all
human
gaze
.
``
So
I
have
won
a
*NL*
battle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
expression
shed
a
rosy
light
on
his
situation
,
and
restored
him
to
*NL*
some
serenity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
with
a
salary
of
fifty
francs
a
month
,
M.
de
Renal
must
be
*NL*
precious
afraid
,
but
what
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
meditation
about
what
could
have
put
fear
into
the
heart
of
that
*NL*
happy
,
powerful
man
against
whom
he
had
been
boiling
with
rage
only
*NL*
an
hour
back
,
completed
the
restoration
to
serenity
of
Julien
's
soul
.
*NL*
He
was
almost
able
to
enjoy
for
a
moment
the
delightful
beauty
of
the
*NL*
woods
amidst
which
he
was
walking
.
Enormous
blocks
of
bare
rocks
had
*NL*
fallen
down
long
ago
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
by
the
mountain
side
.
*NL*
Great
cedars
towered
almost
as
high
as
these
rocks
whose
shade
caused
a
*NL*
delicious
freshness
within
three
yards
of
places
where
the
heat
of
the
*NL*
sun
's
rays
would
have
made
it
impossible
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
took
breath
for
a
moment
in
the
shade
of
these
great
rocks
,
*NL*
and
then
he
began
again
to
climb
.
Traversing
a
narrow
path
that
was
*NL*
scarcely
marked
,
and
was
only
used
by
the
goat
herds
,
he
soon
found
*NL*
himself
standing
upon
an
immense
rock
with
the
complete
certainty
of
*NL*
being
far
away
from
all
mankind
.
This
physical
position
made
him
smile
.
*NL*
It
symbolised
to
him
the
position
he
was
burning
to
attain
in
the
moral
*NL*
sphere
.
The
pure
air
of
these
lovely
mountains
filled
his
soul
with
*NL*
serenity
and
even
with
joy
.
The
mayor
of
Verrieres
still
continued
to
*NL*
typify
in
his
eyes
all
the
wealth
and
all
the
arrogance
of
the
earth
;
*NL*
but
Julien
felt
that
the
hatred
that
had
just
thrilled
him
had
nothing
*NL*
personal
about
it
in
spite
of
all
the
violence
which
he
had
manifested
.
*NL*
If
he
had
left
off
seeing
M.
de
Renal
he
would
in
eight
days
have
*NL*
forgotten
him
,
his
castle
,
his
dogs
,
his
children
and
all
his
family
.
*NL*
``
I
forced
him
,
I
do
n't
know
how
,
to
make
the
greatest
sacrifice
.
What
?
*NL*
more
than
fifty
crowns
a
year
,
and
only
a
minute
before
I
managed
to
*NL*
extricate
myself
from
the
greatest
danger
;
so
there
are
two
victories
*NL*
in
one
day
.
The
second
one
is
devoid
of
merit
,
I
must
find
out
the
why
*NL*
and
the
wherefore
.
But
these
laborious
researches
are
for
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Standing
up
on
his
great
rock
,
Julien
looked
at
the
sky
which
was
all
*NL*
afire
with
an
August
sun
.
The
grasshoppers
sang
in
the
field
about
the
*NL*
rock
;
when
they
held
their
peace
there
was
universal
silence
around
*NL*
him
.
He
saw
twenty
leagues
of
country
at
his
feet
.
He
noticed
from
*NL*
time
to
time
some
hawk
,
which
launching
off
from
the
great
rocks
over
*NL*
his
head
was
describing
in
silence
its
immense
circles
.
Julien
's
eye
*NL*
followed
the
bird
of
prey
mechanically
.
Its
tranquil
powerful
movements
*NL*
struck
him
.
He
envied
that
strength
,
that
isolation
.
*NL*
*NL*

Would
Napoleon
's
destiny
be
one
day
his

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
AN
EVENING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Julia
's
very
coldness
still
was
kind
,
*NL*
And
tremulously
gently
her
small
hand
*NL*
Withdrew
itself
from
his
,
but
left
behind
*NL*
A
little
pressure
,
thrilling
,
and
so
bland
,
*NL*
And
slight
,
so
very
slight
that
to
the
mind
,
*NL*
'T
was
but
a
doubt
.

Juan

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
necessary
,
however
,
to
put
in
an
appearance
at
Verrieres
.
As
*NL*
Julien
left
the
cure
house
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
meet
M.
Valenod
,
*NL*
whom
he
hastened
to
tell
of
the
increase
in
his
salary
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
to
Vergy
,
Julien
waited
till
night
had
fallen
before
going
*NL*
down
into
the
garden
.
His
soul
was
fatigued
by
the
great
number
of
*NL*
violent
emotions
which
had
agitated
him
during
the
day
.
``
What
shall
I
*NL*
say
to
them
?
''
he
reflected
anxiously
,
as
he
thought
about
the
ladies
.
*NL*
He
was
far
from
realising
that
his
soul
was
just
in
a
mood
to
discuss
*NL*
those
trivial
circumstances
which
usually
monopolise
all
feminine
*NL*
interests
.
Julien
was
often
unintelligible
to
Madame
Derville
,
and
even
*NL*
to
her
friend
,
and
he
in
his
turn
only
half
understood
all
that
they
*NL*
said
to
him
.
Such
was
the
effect
of
the
force
and
,
if
I
may
venture
to
*NL*
use
such
language
,
the
greatness
of
the
transports
of
passion
which
*NL*
overwhelmed
the
soul
of
this
ambitious
youth
.
In
this
singular
being
it
*NL*
was
storm
nearly
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
entered
the
garden
this
evening
,
Julien
was
inclined
to
take
an
*NL*
interest
in
what
the
pretty
cousins
were
thinking
.
They
were
waiting
*NL*
for
him
impatiently
.
He
took
his
accustomed
seat
next
to
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
.
The
darkness
soon
became
profound
.
He
attempted
to
take
hold
of
*NL*
a
white
hand
which
he
had
seen
some
time
near
him
,
as
it
leant
on
the
*NL*
back
of
a
chair
.
Some
hesitation
was
shewn
,
but
eventually
the
hand
was
*NL*
withdrawn
in
a
manner
which
indicated
displeasure
.
Julien
was
inclined
*NL*
to
give
up
the
attempt
as
a
bad
job
,
and
to
continue
his
conversation
*NL*
quite
gaily
,
when
he
heard
M.
de
Renal
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coarse
words
he
had
uttered
in
the
morning
were
still
ringing
in
*NL*
Julien
's
ears
.
``
Would
not
taking
possession
of
his
wife
's
hand
in
his
*NL*
very
presence
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
be
a
good
way
of
scoring
off
that
*NL*
creature
who
has
all
that
life
can
give
him
.
Yes
!
I
will
do
it
.
I
,
the
*NL*
very
man
for
whom
he
has
evidenced
so
great
a
contempt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
the
tranquillity
which
was
so
alien
to
Julien
's
real
*NL*
character
quickly
disappeared
.
He
was
obsessed
by
an
anxious
desire
*NL*
that
Madame
de
Renal
should
abandon
her
hand
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
was
talking
politics
with
vehemence
;
two
or
three
*NL*
commercial
men
in
Verrieres
had
been
growing
distinctly
richer
than
he
*NL*
was
,
and
were
going
to
annoy
him
over
the
elections
.
Madame
Derville
*NL*
was
listening
to
him
.
Irritated
by
these
tirades
,
Julien
brought
his
*NL*
chair
nearer
Madame
de
Renal
.
All
his
movements
were
concealed
by
the
*NL*
darkness
.
He
dared
to
put
his
hand
very
near
to
the
pretty
arm
which
*NL*
was
left
uncovered
by
the
dress
.
He
was
troubled
and
had
lost
control
*NL*
of
his
mind
.
He
brought
his
face
near
to
that
pretty
arm
and
dared
to
*NL*
put
his
lips
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
shuddered
.
Her
husband
was
four
paces
away
.
She
*NL*
hastened
to
give
her
hand
to
Julien
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
push
him
*NL*
back
a
little
.
As
M.
de
Renal
was
continuing
his
insults
against
those
*NL*
ne'er
-
do-wells
and
Jacobins
who
were
growing
so
rich
,
Julien
covered
*NL*
the
hand
which
had
been
abandoned
to
him
with
kisses
,
which
were
either
*NL*
really
passionate
or
at
any
rate
seemed
so
to
Madame
de
Renal
.
But
*NL*
the
poor
woman
had
already
had
the
proofs
on
that
same
fatal
day
that
*NL*
the
man
whom
she
adored
,
without
owning
it
to
herself
,
loved
another
!
*NL*
During
the
whole
time
Julien
had
been
absent
she
had
been
the
prey
to
*NL*
an
extreme
unhappiness
which
had
made
her
reflect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
Am
I
going
to
love
,
am
I
going
to
be
in
*NL*
love
?
Am
I
,
a
married
woman
,
going
to
fall
in
love
?
But
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
I
have
never
felt
for
my
husband
this
dark
madness
,
which
*NL*
never
permits
of
my
keeping
Julien
out
of
my
thoughts
.
After
all
,
he
*NL*
is
only
a
child
who
is
full
of
respect
for
me
.
This
madness
will
be
*NL*
fleeting
.
In
what
way
do
the
sentiments
which
I
may
have
for
this
young
*NL*
man
concern
my
husband
?
M.
de
Renal
would
be
bored
by
the
conversations
*NL*
which
I
have
with
Julien
on
imaginative
subjects
.
As
for
him
,
he
simply
*NL*
thinks
of
his
business
.
I
am
not
taking
anything
away
from
him
to
give
*NL*
to
Julien
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
hypocrisy
had
sullied
the
purity
of
that
naive
soul
,
now
swept
away
*NL*
by
a
passion
such
as
it
had
never
felt
before
.
She
deceived
herself
,
*NL*
but
without
knowing
it
.
But
none
the
less
,
a
certain
instinct
of
virtue
*NL*
was
alarmed
.
Such
were
the
combats
which
were
agitating
her
when
*NL*
Julien
appeared
in
the
garden
.
She
heard
him
speak
and
almost
at
the
*NL*
same
moment
she
saw
him
sit
down
by
her
side
.
Her
soul
was
as
it
were
*NL*
transported
by
this
charming
happiness
which
had
for
the
last
fortnight
*NL*
surprised
her
even
more
than
it
had
allured
.
Everything
was
novel
for
*NL*
her
.
None
the
less
,
she
said
to
herself
after
some
moments
,
``
the
mere
*NL*
presence
of
Julien
is
quite
enough
to
blot
out
all
his
wrongs
.
''
She
was
*NL*
frightened
;
it
was
then
that
she
took
away
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
passionate
kisses
,
the
like
of
which
she
had
never
received
before
,
*NL*
made
her
forget
that
perhaps
he
loved
another
woman
.
Soon
he
was
no
*NL*
longer
guilty
in
her
eyes
.
The
cessation
of
that
poignant
pain
which
*NL*
suspicion
had
engendered
and
the
presence
of
a
happiness
that
she
had
*NL*
never
even
dreamt
of
,
gave
her
ecstasies
of
love
and
of
mad
gaiety
.
*NL*
The
evening
was
charming
for
everyone
,
except
the
mayor
of
Verrieres
,
*NL*
who
was
unable
to
forget
his
_
parvenu
_
manufacturers
.
Julien
left
off
*NL*
thinking
about
his
black
ambition
,
or
about
those
plans
of
his
which
*NL*
were
so
difficult
to
accomplish
.
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
*NL*
led
away
by
the
power
of
beauty
.
Lost
in
a
sweetly
vague
reverie
,
quite
*NL*
alien
to
his
character
,
and
softly
pressing
that
hand
,
which
he
thought
*NL*
ideally
pretty
,
he
half
listened
to
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
of
the
*NL*
pine
trees
,
swept
by
the
light
night
breeze
,
and
to
the
dogs
of
the
*NL*
mill
on
the
Doubs
,
who
barked
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
emotion
was
one
of
pleasure
and
not
passion
.
As
he
entered
his
*NL*
room
,
he
only
thought
of
one
happiness
,
that
of
taking
up
again
his
*NL*
favourite
book
.
When
one
is
twenty
the
idea
of
the
world
and
the
figure
*NL*
to
be
cut
in
it
dominate
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
soon
,
however
,
laid
down
the
book
.
As
the
result
of
thinking
of
the
*NL*
victories
of
Napoleon
,
he
had
seen
a
new
element
in
his
own
victory
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
have
won
a
battle
.
I
must
exploit
it
.
I
*NL*
must
crush
the
pride
of
that
proud
gentleman
while
he
is
in
retreat
.
*NL*
That
would
be
real
Napoleon
.
I
must
ask
him
for
three
days
'
holiday
to
*NL*
go
and
see
my
friend
Fouque
.
If
he
refuses
me
I
will
threaten
to
give
*NL*
him
notice
,
but
he
will
yield
the
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
could
not
sleep
a
wink
.
It
seemed
as
though
,
until
this
*NL*
moment
,
she
had
never
lived
.
She
was
unable
to
distract
her
thoughts
*NL*
from
the
happiness
of
feeling
Julian
cover
her
hand
with
his
burning
*NL*
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
awful
word
adultery
came
into
her
mind
.
All
the
*NL*
loathesomeness
with
which
the
vilest
debauchery
can
invest
sensual
love
*NL*
presented
itself
to
her
imagination
.
These
ideas
essayed
to
pollute
the
*NL*
divinely
tender
image
which
she
was
fashioning
of
Julien
,
and
of
the
*NL*
happiness
of
loving
him
.
The
future
began
to
be
painted
in
terrible
*NL*
colours
.
She
began
to
regard
herself
as
contemptible
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
moment
was
awful
.
Her
soul
was
arriving
in
unknown
countries
.
*NL*
During
the
evening
she
had
tasted
a
novel
happiness
.
Now
she
found
*NL*
herself
suddenly
plunged
in
an
atrocious
unhappiness
.
She
had
never
*NL*
had
any
idea
of
such
sufferings
;
they
troubled
her
reason
.
She
thought
*NL*
for
a
moment
of
confessing
to
her
husband
that
she
was
apprehensive
*NL*
of
loving
Julien
.
It
would
be
an
opportunity
of
speaking
of
him
.
*NL*
Fortunately
her
memory
threw
up
a
maxim
which
her
aunt
had
once
given
*NL*
her
on
the
eve
of
her
marriage
.
The
maxim
dealt
with
the
danger
of
*NL*
making
confidences
to
a
husband
,
for
a
husband
is
after
all
a
master
.
*NL*
She
wrung
her
hands
in
the
excess
of
her
grief
.
She
was
driven
this
way
*NL*
and
that
by
clashing
and
painful
ideas
.
At
one
moment
she
feared
that
*NL*
she
was
not
loved
.
The
next
the
awful
idea
of
crime
tortured
her
,
as
*NL*
much
as
if
she
had
to
be
exposed
in
the
pillory
on
the
following
day
in
*NL*
the
public
square
of
Verrieres
,
with
a
placard
to
explain
her
adultery
*NL*
to
the
populace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
had
no
experience
of
life
.
Even
in
the
full
possession
*NL*
of
her
faculties
,
and
when
fully
exercising
her
reason
,
she
would
never
*NL*
have
appreciated
any
distinction
between
being
guilty
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
God
,
and
finding
herself
publicly
overwhelmed
with
the
crudest
marks
of
*NL*
universal
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
awful
idea
of
adultery
,
and
of
all
the
disgrace
which
in
her
*NL*
view
that
crime
brought
in
its
train
,
left
her
some
rest
,
she
began
to
*NL*
dream
of
the
sweetness
of
living
innocently
with
Julien
as
in
the
days
*NL*
that
had
gone
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
herself
confronted
with
the
horrible
idea
that
Julien
loved
*NL*
another
woman
.
She
still
saw
his
pallor
when
he
had
feared
to
lose
*NL*
her
portrait
,
or
to
compromise
her
by
exposing
it
to
view
.
For
the
*NL*
first
time
she
had
caught
fear
on
that
tranquil
and
noble
visage
.
He
*NL*
had
never
shewn
such
emotion
to
her
or
her
children
.
This
additional
*NL*
anguish
reached
the
maximum
of
unhappiness
which
the
human
soul
is
*NL*
capable
of
enduring
.
Unconsciously
,
Madame
de
Renal
uttered
cries
which
*NL*
woke
up
her
maid
.
Suddenly
she
saw
the
brightness
of
a
light
appear
*NL*
near
her
bed
,
and
recognized
Elisa
.
``
Is
it
you
he
loves
?
''
she
exclaimed
*NL*
in
her
delirium
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
the
maid
was
so
astonished
by
the
terrible
trouble
in
*NL*
which
she
found
her
mistress
that
she
paid
no
attention
to
this
*NL*
singular
expression
.
Madame
de
Renal
appreciated
her
imprudence
.
*NL*
``
I
have
the
fever
,
''
she
said
to
her
,
``
and
I
think
I
am
a
little
*NL*
delirious
.
''
Completely
woken
up
by
the
necessity
of
controlling
*NL*
herself
,
she
became
less
unhappy
.
Reason
regained
that
supreme
control
*NL*
which
the
semi-somnolent
state
had
taken
away
.
To
free
herself
from
her
*NL*
maid
's
continual
stare
,
she
ordered
her
maid
to
read
the
paper
,
and
*NL*
it
was
as
she
listened
to
the
monotonous
voice
of
this
girl
,
reading
*NL*
a
long
article
from
the
_
Quotidienne
_
that
Madame
de
Renal
made
the
*NL*
virtuous
resolution
to
treat
Julien
with
absolute
coldness
when
she
saw
*NL*
him
again
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
A
JOURNEY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elegant
people
are
to
be
found
in
Paris
.
People
of
*NL*
character
may
exist
in
the
provinces
.
--
Sieyes
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
five
o'clock
the
following
day
,
before
Madame
de
Renal
was
visible
,
*NL*
Julien
obtained
a
three
days
'
holiday
from
her
husband
.
Contrary
to
his
*NL*
expectation
Julien
found
himself
desirous
of
seeing
her
again
.
He
kept
*NL*
thinking
of
that
pretty
hand
of
hers
.
He
went
down
into
the
garden
,
but
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
kept
him
waiting
for
a
long
time
.
But
if
Julien
had
*NL*
loved
her
,
he
would
have
seen
her
forehead
glued
to
the
pane
behind
the
*NL*
half-closed
blinds
on
the
first
floor
.
She
was
looking
at
him
.
Finally
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
her
resolutions
,
she
decided
to
go
into
the
garden
.
Her
*NL*
habitual
pallor
had
been
succeeded
by
more
lively
hues
.
This
woman
,
*NL*
simple
as
she
was
,
was
manifestly
agitated
;
a
sentiment
of
constraint
,
*NL*
and
even
of
anger
,
altered
that
expression
of
profound
serenity
which
*NL*
seemed
,
as
it
were
,
to
be
above
all
the
vulgar
interests
of
life
and
*NL*
gave
so
much
charm
to
that
divine
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
approached
her
with
eagerness
,
admiring
those
beautiful
arms
*NL*
which
were
just
visible
through
a
hastily
donned
shawl
.
The
freshness
*NL*
of
the
morning
air
seemed
to
accentuate
still
more
the
brilliance
of
*NL*
her
complexion
which
the
agitation
of
the
past
night
rendered
all
the
*NL*
more
susceptible
to
all
impressions
.
This
demure
and
pathetic
beauty
,
*NL*
which
was
,
at
the
same
time
,
full
of
thoughts
which
are
never
found
in
*NL*
the
inferior
classes
,
seemed
to
reveal
to
Julien
a
faculty
in
his
own
*NL*
soul
which
he
had
never
before
realised
.
Engrossed
in
his
admiration
of
*NL*
the
charms
on
which
his
his
greedy
gaze
was
riveted
,
Julien
took
for
*NL*
granted
the
friendly
welcome
which
he
was
expecting
to
receive
.
He
was
*NL*
all
the
more
astonished
at
the
icy
coldness
which
she
endeavoured
to
*NL*
manifest
to
him
,
and
through
which
he
thought
he
could
even
distinguish
*NL*
the
intention
of
putting
him
in
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smile
of
pleasure
died
away
from
his
lips
as
he
remembered
his
*NL*
rank
in
society
,
especially
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
rich
and
noble
*NL*
heiress
.
In
a
single
moment
his
face
exhibited
nothing
but
haughtiness
*NL*
and
anger
against
himself
.
He
felt
violently
disgusted
that
he
could
*NL*
have
put
off
his
departure
for
more
than
an
hour
,
simply
to
receive
so
*NL*
humiliating
a
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
only
a
fool
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
who
is
angry
with
others
;
a
*NL*
stone
falls
because
it
is
heavy
.
Am
I
going
to
be
a
child
all
my
life
?
*NL*
How
on
earth
is
it
that
I
manage
to
contract
the
charming
habit
of
*NL*
showing
my
real
self
to
those
people
simply
in
return
for
their
money
?
*NL*
If
I
want
to
win
their
respect
and
that
of
my
own
self
,
I
must
shew
*NL*
them
that
it
is
simply
a
business
transaction
between
my
poverty
and
*NL*
their
wealth
,
but
that
my
heart
is
a
thousand
leagues
away
from
their
*NL*
insolence
,
and
is
situated
in
too
high
a
sphere
to
be
affected
by
their
*NL*
petty
marks
of
favour
or
disdain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
feelings
were
crowding
the
soul
of
the
young
tutor
,
his
*NL*
mobile
features
assumed
an
expression
of
ferocity
and
injured
pride
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
extremely
troubled
.
The
virtuous
coldness
that
she
*NL*
had
meant
to
put
into
her
welcome
was
succeeded
by
an
expression
of
*NL*
interest
--
an
interest
animated
by
all
the
surprise
brought
about
by
*NL*
the
sudden
change
which
she
had
just
seen
.
The
empty
morning
platitudes
*NL*
about
their
health
and
the
fineness
of
the
day
suddenly
dried
up
.
*NL*
Julien
's
judgment
was
disturbed
by
no
passion
,
and
he
soon
found
a
*NL*
means
of
manifesting
to
Madame
de
Renal
how
light
was
the
friendly
*NL*
relationship
that
he
considered
existed
between
them
.
He
said
nothing
*NL*
to
her
about
the
little
journey
that
he
was
going
to
make
;
saluted
her
,
*NL*
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
watched
him
go
,
she
was
overwhelmed
by
the
sombre
haughtiness
*NL*
which
she
read
in
that
look
which
had
been
so
gracious
the
previous
*NL*
evening
.
Her
eldest
son
ran
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
and
said
*NL*
as
he
kissed
her
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
a
holiday
,
M.
Julien
is
going
on
a
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
,
Madame
de
Renal
felt
seized
by
a
deadly
coldness
.
She
*NL*
was
unhappy
by
reason
of
her
virtue
,
and
even
more
unhappy
by
reason
of
*NL*
her
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
new
event
engrossed
her
imagination
,
and
she
was
transported
far
*NL*
beyond
the
good
resolutions
which
she
owed
to
the
awful
night
she
had
*NL*
just
passed
.
It
was
not
now
a
question
of
resisting
that
charming
*NL*
lover
,
but
of
losing
him
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
necessary
to
appear
at
breakfast
.
To
complete
her
anguish
,
M.
de
*NL*
Renal
and
Madame
Derville
talked
of
nothing
but
Julien
's
departure
.
The
*NL*
mayor
of
Verrieres
had
noticed
something
unusual
in
the
firm
tone
in
*NL*
which
he
had
asked
for
a
holiday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
little
peasant
has
no
doubt
got
somebody
else
's
offer
up
his
*NL*
sleeve
,
but
that
somebody
else
,
even
though
it
's
M.
Valenod
,
is
bound
*NL*
to
be
a
little
discouraged
by
the
sum
of
six
hundred
francs
,
which
the
*NL*
annual
salary
now
tots
up
to
.
He
must
have
asked
yesterday
at
Verrieres
*NL*
for
a
period
of
three
days
to
think
it
over
,
and
our
little
gentleman
*NL*
runs
off
to
the
mountains
this
morning
so
as
not
to
be
obliged
to
give
*NL*
me
an
answer
.
Think
of
having
to
reckon
with
a
wretched
workman
who
*NL*
puts
on
airs
,
but
that
's
what
we
've
come
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
my
husband
,
who
does
not
know
how
deeply
he
has
wounded
Julien
,
*NL*
thinks
that
he
will
leave
us
,
what
can
I
think
myself
?
''
said
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
to
herself
.
``
Yes
,
that
is
all
decided
.
''
In
order
to
be
able
at
*NL*
any
rate
to
be
free
to
cry
,
and
to
avoid
answering
Madame
Derville
's
*NL*
questions
,
she
pleaded
an
awful
headache
,
and
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
women
are
,
''
repeated
M.
de
Renal
,
``
there
is
always
*NL*
something
out
of
order
in
those
complicated
machines
,
''
and
he
went
off
*NL*
jeering
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Madame
de
Renal
was
a
prey
to
all
the
poignancy
of
the
terrible
*NL*
passion
in
which
chance
had
involved
her
,
Julien
went
merrily
on
his
*NL*
way
,
surrounded
by
the
most
beautiful
views
that
mountain
scenery
*NL*
can
offer
.
He
had
to
cross
the
great
chain
north
of
Vergy
.
The
path
*NL*
which
he
followed
rose
gradually
among
the
big
beech
woods
,
and
ran
*NL*
into
infinite
spirals
on
the
slope
of
the
high
mountain
which
forms
*NL*
the
northern
boundary
of
the
Doubs
valley
.
Soon
the
traveller
's
view
,
*NL*
as
he
passed
over
the
lower
slopes
bounding
the
course
of
the
Doubs
*NL*
towards
the
south
,
extends
as
far
as
the
fertile
plains
of
Burgundy
and
*NL*
Beaujolais
.
However
insensible
was
the
soul
of
this
ambitious
youth
to
*NL*
this
kind
of
beauty
,
he
could
not
help
stopping
from
time
to
time
to
*NL*
look
at
a
spectacle
at
once
so
vast
and
so
impressive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
he
reached
the
summit
of
the
great
mountain
,
near
which
*NL*
he
had
to
pass
in
order
to
arrive
by
this
cross-country
route
at
*NL*
the
solitary
valley
where
lived
his
friend
Fouque
,
the
young
wood
*NL*
merchant
.
Julien
was
in
no
hurry
to
see
him
;
either
him
,
or
any
other
*NL*
human
being
.
Hidden
like
a
bird
of
prey
amid
the
bare
rocks
which
*NL*
crowned
the
great
mountain
,
he
could
see
a
long
way
off
anyone
coming
*NL*
near
him
.
He
discovered
a
little
grotto
in
the
middle
of
the
almost
*NL*
vertical
slope
of
one
of
the
rocks
.
He
found
a
way
to
it
,
and
was
soon
*NL*
ensconced
in
this
retreat
.
``
Here
,
''
he
said
,
``
with
eyes
brilliant
with
*NL*
joy
,
men
can
not
hurt
me
.
''
It
occurred
to
him
to
indulge
in
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
writing
down
those
thoughts
of
his
which
were
so
dangerous
to
him
*NL*
everywhere
else
.
A
square
stone
served
him
for
a
desk
;
his
pen
flew
.
He
*NL*
saw
nothing
of
what
was
around
him
.
He
noticed
at
last
that
the
sun
was
*NL*
setting
behind
the
distant
mountains
of
Beaujolais
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
I
pass
the
night
here
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
I
have
*NL*
bread
,
and
I
am
free
.
''
He
felt
a
spiritual
exultation
at
the
sound
of
*NL*
that
great
word
.
The
necessity
of
playing
the
hypocrite
resulted
in
his
*NL*
not
being
free
,
even
at
Fouque
's
.
Leaning
his
head
on
his
two
hands
,
*NL*
Julien
stayed
in
the
grotto
,
more
happy
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
*NL*
life
,
thrilled
by
his
dreams
,
and
by
the
bliss
of
his
freedom
.
Without
*NL*
realising
it
,
he
saw
all
the
rays
of
the
twilight
become
successively
*NL*
extinguished
.
Surrounded
by
this
immense
obscurity
,
his
soul
wandered
*NL*
into
the
contemplation
of
what
he
imagined
that
he
would
one
day
meet
*NL*
in
Paris
.
First
it
was
a
woman
,
much
more
beautiful
and
possessed
of
a
*NL*
much
more
refined
temperament
than
anything
he
could
have
found
in
the
*NL*
provinces
.
He
loved
with
passion
,
and
was
loved
.
If
he
separated
from
*NL*
her
for
some
instants
,
it
was
only
to
cover
himself
with
glory
,
and
to
*NL*
deserve
to
be
loved
still
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
man
brought
up
in
the
environment
of
the
sad
truths
of
Paris
*NL*
society
,
would
,
on
reaching
this
point
in
his
romance
,
even
if
we
*NL*
assume
him
possessed
of
Julien
's
imagination
,
have
been
brought
back
*NL*
to
himself
by
the
cold
irony
of
the
situation
.
Great
deeds
would
have
*NL*
disappeared
from
out
his
ken
together
with
hope
of
achieving
them
and
*NL*
have
been
succeeded
by
the
platitude
.
``
If
one
leave
one
's
mistress
*NL*
one
runs
alas
!
the
risk
of
being
deceived
two
or
three
times
a
day
.
''
*NL*
But
the
young
peasant
saw
nothing
but
the
lack
of
opportunity
between
*NL*
himself
and
the
most
heroic
feats
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
deep
night
had
succeeded
the
day
,
and
there
were
still
two
*NL*
leagues
to
walk
before
he
could
descend
to
the
cabin
in
which
Fouque
*NL*
lived
.
Before
leaving
the
little
cave
,
Julien
made
a
light
and
*NL*
carefully
burnt
all
that
he
had
written
.
He
quite
astonished
his
friend
*NL*
when
he
knocked
at
his
door
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
He
found
*NL*
Fouque
engaged
in
making
up
his
accounts
.
He
was
a
young
man
of
high
*NL*
stature
,
rather
badly
made
,
with
big
,
hard
features
,
a
never-ending
*NL*
nose
,
and
a
large
fund
of
good
nature
concealed
beneath
this
repulsive
*NL*
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
quarelled
with
M.
de
Renal
then
that
you
turn
up
unexpectedly
*NL*
like
this
?
''
Julien
told
him
,
but
in
a
suitable
way
,
the
events
of
the
*NL*
previous
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
with
me
,
''
said
Fouque
to
him
.
``
I
see
that
you
know
M.
de
Renal
,
*NL*
M.
Valenod
,
the
sub-prefect
Maugron
,
the
cure
Chelan
.
You
have
*NL*
understood
the
subtleties
of
the
character
of
those
people
.
So
there
*NL*
you
are
then
,
quite
qualified
to
attend
auctions
.
You
know
arithmetic
*NL*
better
than
I
do
;
you
will
keep
my
accounts
;
I
make
a
lot
in
my
*NL*
business
.
The
impossibility
of
doing
everything
myself
,
and
the
fear
*NL*
of
taking
a
rascal
for
my
partner
prevents
me
daily
from
undertaking
*NL*
excellent
business
.
It
's
scarcely
a
month
since
I
put
Michaud
de
*NL*
Saint-Amand
,
whom
I
have
n't
seen
for
six
years
,
and
whom
I
ran
across
*NL*
at
the
sale
at
Pontarlier
in
the
way
of
making
six
thousand
francs
.
Why
*NL*
should
n't
it
have
been
you
who
made
those
six
thousand
francs
,
or
at
*NL*
any
rate
three
thousand
.
For
if
I
had
had
you
with
me
that
day
,
I
would
*NL*
have
raised
the
bidding
for
that
lot
of
timber
and
everybody
else
would
*NL*
soon
have
run
away
.
Be
my
partner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
offer
upset
Julien
.
It
spoilt
the
train
of
his
mad
dreams
.
Fouque
*NL*
showed
his
accounts
to
Julien
during
the
whole
of
the
supper
--
which
the
*NL*
two
friends
prepared
themselves
like
the
Homeric
heroes
-LRB-
for
Fouque
*NL*
lived
alone
-RRB-
and
proved
to
him
all
the
advantages
offered
by
his
timber
*NL*
business
.
Fouque
had
the
highest
opinion
of
the
gifts
and
character
of
*NL*
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
finally
,
the
latter
was
alone
in
his
little
room
of
pinewood
,
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
:
``
It
is
true
I
can
make
some
thousands
of
francs
here
*NL*
and
then
take
up
with
advantage
the
profession
of
a
soldier
,
or
of
a
*NL*
priest
,
according
to
the
fashion
then
prevalent
in
France
.
The
little
*NL*
hoard
that
I
shall
have
amassed
will
remove
all
petty
difficulties
.
In
*NL*
the
solitude
of
this
mountain
I
shall
have
dissipated
to
some
extent
my
*NL*
awful
ignorance
of
so
many
of
the
things
which
make
up
the
life
of
all
*NL*
those
men
of
fashion
.
But
Fouque
has
given
up
all
thoughts
of
marriage
,
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
keeps
telling
me
that
solitude
makes
him
unhappy
.
*NL*
It
is
clear
that
if
he
takes
a
partner
who
has
no
capital
to
put
into
*NL*
his
business
,
he
does
so
in
the
hopes
of
getting
a
companion
who
will
*NL*
never
leave
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
deceive
my
friend
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
petulantly
.
This
being
*NL*
who
found
hypocrisy
and
complete
callousness
his
ordinary
means
of
*NL*
self-preservation
could
not
,
on
this
occasion
,
endure
the
idea
of
the
*NL*
slightest
lack
of
delicate
feeling
towards
a
man
whom
he
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
suddenly
Julien
was
happy
.
He
had
a
reason
for
a
refusal
.
What
!
*NL*
Shall
I
be
coward
enough
to
waste
seven
or
eight
years
.
I
shall
get
to
*NL*
twenty-eight
in
that
way
!
But
at
that
age
Bonaparte
had
achieved
his
*NL*
greatest
feats
.
When
I
shall
have
made
in
obscurity
a
little
money
by
*NL*
frequenting
timber
sales
,
and
earning
the
good
graces
of
some
rascally
*NL*
under-strappers
who
will
guarantee
that
I
shall
still
have
the
sacred
*NL*
fire
with
which
one
makes
a
name
for
oneself
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
morning
,
Julien
with
considerable
sangfroid
,
said
in
*NL*
answer
to
the
good
Fouque
,
who
regarded
the
matter
of
the
partnership
*NL*
as
settled
,
that
his
vocation
for
the
holy
ministry
of
the
altars
would
*NL*
not
permit
him
to
accept
it
.
Fouque
did
not
return
to
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
just
think
,
''
he
repeated
to
him
,
``
I
'll
make
you
my
partner
,
or
if
*NL*
you
prefer
it
,
I
'll
give
you
four
thousand
francs
a
year
,
and
you
want
*NL*
to
return
to
that
M.
de
Renal
of
yours
,
who
despises
you
like
the
mud
*NL*
on
his
shoes
.
When
you
have
got
two
hundred
louis
in
front
of
you
,
what
*NL*
is
to
prevent
you
from
entering
the
seminary
?
I
'll
go
further
:
I
will
*NL*
undertake
to
procure
for
you
the
best
living
in
the
district
,
for
,
''
*NL*
added
Fouque
,
lowering
his
voice
,
I
supply
firewood
to
M.
le
--
,
M.
*NL*
le

,
M.
--
.
I
provide
them
with
first
quality
oak
,
but
they
only
*NL*
pay
me
for
plain
wood
,
but
never
was
money
better
invested
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
conquer
Julien
's
vocation
.
Fouque
finished
by
thinking
*NL*
him
a
little
mad
.
The
third
day
,
in
the
early
morning
,
Julien
left
his
*NL*
friend
,
and
passed
the
day
amongst
the
rocks
of
the
great
mountain
.
He
*NL*
found
his
little
cave
again
,
but
he
had
no
longer
peace
of
mind
.
His
*NL*
friend
's
offers
had
robbed
him
of
it
.
He
found
himself
,
not
between
*NL*
vice
and
virtue
,
like
Hercules
,
but
between
mediocrity
coupled
with
*NL*
an
assured
prosperity
,
and
all
the
heroic
dreams
of
his
youth
.
``
So
I
*NL*
have
not
got
real
determination
after
all
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
and
it
*NL*
was
his
doubt
on
this
score
which
pained
him
the
most
.
``
I
am
not
of
*NL*
the
stuff
of
which
great
men
are
made
,
because
I
fear
that
eight
years
*NL*
spent
in
earning
a
livelihood
will
deprive
me
of
that
sublime
energy
*NL*
which
inspires
the
accomplishment
of
extraordinary
feats
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
OPEN
WORK
STOCKINGS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
novel
:
a
mirror
which
one
takes
out
on
one
's
walk
*NL*
along
the
high
road
.
--
_
Saint-Real
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Julien
perceived
the
picturesque
ruins
of
the
old
church
at
Vergy
,
*NL*
he
noticed
that
he
had
not
given
a
single
thought
to
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
since
the
day
before
yesterday
.
The
other
day
,
when
I
took
my
leave
,
*NL*
that
woman
made
me
realise
the
infinite
distance
which
separated
us
;
*NL*
she
treated
me
like
a
labourer
's
son
.
No
doubt
she
wished
to
signify
*NL*
her
repentance
for
having
allowed
me
to
hold
her
hand
the
evening
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
It
is
,
however
very
pretty
,
is
that
hand
.
What
a
charm
,
what
a
*NL*
nobility
is
there
in
that
woman
's
expression
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
possibility
of
making
a
fortune
with
Fouque
gave
a
certain
facility
*NL*
to
Julien
's
logic
.
It
was
not
spoilt
quite
so
frequently
by
the
*NL*
irritation
and
the
keen
consciousness
of
his
poverty
and
low
estate
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
world
.
Placed
as
it
were
on
a
high
promontory
,
he
was
*NL*
able
to
exercise
his
judgment
,
and
had
a
commanding
view
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
of
both
extreme
poverty
and
that
competence
which
he
still
called
*NL*
wealth
.
He
was
far
from
judging
his
position
really
philosophically
,
*NL*
but
he
had
enough
penetration
to
feel
different
after
this
little
*NL*
journey
into
the
mountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
struck
with
the
extreme
uneasiness
with
which
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
listened
to
the
brief
account
which
she
had
asked
for
of
his
journey
.
*NL*
Fouque
had
had
plans
of
marriage
,
and
unhappy
love
affairs
,
and
long
*NL*
confidences
on
this
subject
had
formed
the
staple
of
the
two
friends
'
*NL*
conversation
.
Having
found
happiness
too
soon
,
Fouque
had
realised
*NL*
that
he
was
not
the
only
one
who
was
loved
.
All
these
accounts
had
*NL*
astonished
Julien
.
He
had
learnt
many
new
things
.
His
solitary
life
of
*NL*
imagination
and
suspicion
had
kept
him
remote
from
anything
which
could
*NL*
enlighten
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
his
absence
,
life
had
been
nothing
for
Madame
de
Renal
but
a
*NL*
series
of
tortures
,
which
,
though
different
,
were
all
unbearable
.
She
*NL*
was
really
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
mind
,
''
said
Madame
Derville
to
her
when
she
saw
Julien
arrive
,
*NL*
``
you
do
n't
go
into
the
garden
this
evening
in
your
weak
state
;
the
damp
*NL*
air
will
make
your
complaint
twice
as
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Derville
was
surprised
to
see
that
her
friend
,
who
was
always
*NL*
scolded
by
M.
de
Renal
by
reason
of
the
excessive
simplicity
of
her
*NL*
dress
,
had
just
got
some
open-work
stockings
and
some
charming
little
*NL*
shoes
which
had
come
from
Paris
.
For
three
days
Madame
de
Renal
's
only
*NL*
distraction
had
been
to
cut
out
a
summer
dress
of
a
pretty
little
*NL*
material
which
was
very
fashionable
,
and
get
it
made
with
express
speed
*NL*
by
Elisa
.
This
dress
could
scarcely
have
been
finished
a
few
moments
*NL*
before
Julien
's
arrival
,
but
Madame
de
Renal
put
it
on
immediately
.
Her
*NL*
friend
had
no
longer
any
doubt
.
``
She
loves
,
''
unhappy
woman
,
said
Madame
*NL*
Derville
to
herself
.
She
understood
all
the
strange
symptoms
of
the
*NL*
malady
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
her
speak
to
Julien
.
The
most
violent
blush
was
succeeded
by
*NL*
pallor
.
Anxiety
was
depicted
in
her
eyes
,
which
were
riveted
on
those
*NL*
of
the
young
tutor
.
Madame
de
Renal
expected
every
minute
that
he
would
*NL*
give
an
explanation
of
his
conduct
,
and
announce
that
he
was
either
*NL*
going
to
leave
the
house
or
stay
there
.
Julien
carefully
avoided
that
*NL*
subject
,
and
did
not
even
think
of
it
.
After
terrible
struggles
,
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
eventually
dared
to
say
to
him
in
a
trembling
voice
that
*NL*
mirrored
all
her
passion
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
leave
your
pupils
to
take
another
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
struck
by
Madame
de
Renal
's
hesitating
voice
and
look
.
*NL*
``
That
woman
loves
me
,
''
he
said
to
himself
!
``
But
after
this
temporary
*NL*
moment
of
weakness
,
for
which
her
pride
is
no
doubt
reproaching
her
,
*NL*
and
as
soon
as
she
has
ceased
fearing
that
I
shall
leave
,
she
will
be
*NL*
as
haughty
as
ever
.
''
This
view
of
their
mutual
position
passed
through
*NL*
Julien
's
mind
as
rapidly
as
a
flash
of
lightning
.
He
answered
with
some
*NL*
hesitation
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
extremely
distressed
to
leave
children
who
are
so
nice
*NL*
and
so
well-born
,
but
perhaps
it
will
be
necessary
.
One
has
duties
to
*NL*
oneself
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
pronounced
the
expression
,
``
well-born
''
-LRB-
it
was
one
of
those
*NL*
aristocratic
phrases
which
Julien
had
recently
learnt
-RRB-
,
he
became
*NL*
animated
by
a
profound
feeling
of
antipathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
well-born
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
in
that
woman
's
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Madame
de
Renal
listened
to
him
,
she
admired
his
genius
and
his
*NL*
beauty
,
and
the
hinted
possibility
of
his
departure
pierced
her
*NL*
heart
.
All
her
friends
at
Verrieres
who
had
come
to
dine
at
Vergy
*NL*
during
Julien
's
absence
had
complimented
her
almost
jealously
on
the
*NL*
astonishing
man
whom
her
husband
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
unearth
.
*NL*
It
was
not
that
they
understood
anything
about
the
progress
of
*NL*
children
.
The
feat
of
knowing
his
Bible
by
heart
,
and
what
is
more
,
of
*NL*
knowing
it
in
Latin
,
had
struck
the
inhabitants
of
Verrieres
with
an
*NL*
admiration
which
will
last
perhaps
a
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
,
who
never
spoke
to
anyone
,
was
ignorant
of
all
this
.
If
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
had
possessed
the
slightest
presence
of
mind
,
she
would
have
*NL*
complimented
him
on
the
reputation
which
he
had
won
,
and
Julien
's
*NL*
pride
,
once
satisfied
,
he
would
have
been
sweet
and
amiable
towards
*NL*
her
,
especially
as
he
thought
her
new
dress
charming
.
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
was
also
pleased
with
her
pretty
dress
,
and
with
what
Julien
had
*NL*
said
to
her
about
it
,
and
wanted
to
walk
round
the
garden
.
But
she
*NL*
soon
confessed
that
she
was
incapable
of
walking
.
She
had
taken
the
*NL*
traveller
's
arm
,
and
the
contact
of
that
arm
,
far
from
increasing
her
*NL*
strength
,
deprived
her
of
it
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
night
.
They
had
scarcely
sat
down
before
Julien
,
availing
*NL*
himself
of
his
old
privilege
,
dared
to
bring
his
lips
near
his
pretty
*NL*
neighbour
's
arm
,
and
to
take
her
hand
.
He
kept
thinking
of
the
boldness
*NL*
which
Fouque
had
exhibited
with
his
mistresses
and
not
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
;
the
word
``
well-born
''
was
still
heavy
on
his
heart
.
He
felt
his
*NL*
hand
pressed
,
but
experienced
no
pleasure
.
So
far
from
his
being
proud
,
*NL*
or
even
grateful
for
the
sentiment
that
Madame
de
Renal
was
betraying
*NL*
that
evening
by
only
too
evident
signs
,
he
was
almost
insensible
to
*NL*
her
beauty
,
her
elegance
,
and
her
freshness
.
Purity
of
soul
,
and
the
*NL*
absence
of
all
hateful
emotion
,
doubtless
prolong
the
duration
of
*NL*
youth
.
It
is
the
face
which
ages
first
with
the
majority
of
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
sulked
all
the
evening
.
Up
to
the
present
he
had
only
been
angry
*NL*
with
the
social
order
,
but
from
that
time
that
Fouque
had
offered
him
*NL*
an
ignoble
means
of
obtaining
a
competency
,
he
was
irritated
with
*NL*
himself
.
Julien
was
so
engrossed
in
his
thoughts
,
that
,
although
from
*NL*
time
to
time
he
said
a
few
words
to
the
ladies
,
he
eventually
let
go
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
's
hand
without
noticing
it
.
This
action
overwhelmed
the
*NL*
soul
of
the
poor
woman
.
She
saw
in
it
her
whole
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
had
been
certain
of
Julien
's
affection
,
her
virtue
would
*NL*
possibly
have
found
strength
to
resist
him
.
But
trembling
lest
she
*NL*
should
lose
him
for
ever
,
she
was
distracted
by
her
passion
to
*NL*
the
point
of
taking
again
Julien
's
hand
,
which
he
had
left
in
his
*NL*
absent-mindedness
leaning
on
the
back
of
the
chair
.
This
action
woke
up
*NL*
this
ambitious
youth
;
he
would
have
liked
to
have
had
for
witnesses
all
*NL*
those
proud
nobles
who
had
regarded
him
at
meals
,
when
he
was
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
table
with
the
children
,
with
so
condescending
a
smile
.
*NL*
``
That
woman
can
not
despise
me
;
in
that
case
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
I
*NL*
ought
to
shew
my
appreciation
of
her
beauty
.
I
owe
it
to
myself
to
be
*NL*
her
lover
.
''
That
idea
would
not
have
occurred
to
him
before
the
naive
*NL*
confidences
which
his
friend
had
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sudden
resolution
which
he
had
just
made
formed
an
agreeable
*NL*
distraction
.
He
kept
saying
to
himself
,
``
I
must
have
one
of
those
two
*NL*
women
;
''
he
realised
that
he
would
have
very
much
preferred
to
have
*NL*
paid
court
to
Madame
Derville
.
It
was
not
that
she
was
more
agreeable
,
*NL*
but
that
she
had
always
seen
him
as
the
tutor
distinguished
by
his
*NL*
knowledge
,
and
not
as
the
journeyman
carpenter
with
his
cloth
jacket
*NL*
folded
under
his
arm
as
he
had
first
appeared
to
Madame
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
precisely
as
a
young
workman
,
blushing
up
to
the
whites
of
his
*NL*
eyes
,
standing
by
the
door
of
the
house
and
not
daring
to
ring
,
that
he
*NL*
made
the
most
alluring
appeal
to
Madame
de
Renal
's
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
on
reviewing
his
position
,
Julien
saw
that
the
conquest
of
*NL*
Madame
Derville
,
who
had
probably
noticed
the
taste
which
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
was
manifesting
for
him
,
was
out
of
the
question
.
He
was
thus
*NL*
brought
back
to
the
latter
lady
.
``
What
do
I
know
of
the
character
of
*NL*
that
woman
?
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
``
Only
this
:
before
my
journey
,
I
*NL*
used
to
take
her
hand
,
and
she
used
to
take
it
away
.
To-day
,
I
take
my
*NL*
hand
away
,
and
she
seizes
and
presses
it
.
A
fine
opportunity
to
pay
her
*NL*
back
all
the
contempt
she
had
had
for
me
.
God
knows
how
many
lovers
she
*NL*
has
had
,
probably
she
is
only
deciding
in
my
favour
by
reason
of
the
*NL*
easiness
of
assignations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
,
alas
,
is
the
misfortune
of
an
excessive
civilisation
.
The
soul
*NL*
of
a
young
man
of
twenty
,
possessed
of
any
education
,
is
a
thousand
*NL*
leagues
away
from
that
_
abandon
_
without
which
love
is
frequently
but
*NL*
the
most
tedious
of
duties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
owe
it
all
the
more
to
myself
,
''
went
on
the
petty
vanity
of
Julien
,
*NL*
``
to
succeed
with
that
woman
,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
if
I
ever
make
*NL*
a
fortune
,
and
I
am
reproached
by
anyone
with
my
menial
position
as
a
*NL*
tutor
,
I
shall
then
be
able
to
give
out
that
it
was
love
which
got
me
*NL*
the
post
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
again
took
his
hand
away
from
Madame
de
Renal
,
and
then
took
her
*NL*
hand
again
and
pressed
it
.
As
they
went
back
to
the
drawing-room
about
*NL*
midnight
,
Madame
de
Renal
said
to
him
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
leaving
us
,
you
are
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
answered
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
absolutely
must
leave
,
for
I
love
you
passionately
.
It
is
wrong
*NL*
...
how
wrong
indeed
for
a
young
priest
?
''
Madame
de
Renal
leant
upon
*NL*
his
arm
,
and
with
so
much
abandon
that
her
cheek
felt
the
warmth
of
*NL*
Julien
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nights
of
these
two
persons
were
quite
different
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
was
exalted
by
the
ecstacies
of
the
highest
moral
pleasure
.
A
*NL*
coquettish
young
girl
,
who
loves
early
in
life
,
gets
habituated
to
*NL*
the
trouble
of
love
,
and
when
she
reaches
the
age
of
real
passion
,
*NL*
finds
the
charm
of
novelty
lacking
.
As
Madame
de
Renal
had
never
read
*NL*
any
novels
,
all
the
refinements
of
her
happiness
were
new
to
her
.
No
*NL*
mournful
truth
came
to
chill
her
,
not
even
the
spectre
of
the
future
.
*NL*
She
imagined
herself
as
happy
in
ten
years
'
time
as
she
was
at
the
*NL*
present
moment
.
Even
the
idea
of
virtue
and
of
her
sworn
fidelity
to
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
,
which
had
agitated
her
some
days
past
,
now
presented
itself
*NL*
in
vain
,
and
was
sent
about
its
business
like
an
importunate
visitor
.
*NL*
``
I
will
never
grant
anything
to
Julien
,
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
;
``
we
will
*NL*
live
in
the
future
like
we
have
been
living
for
the
last
month
.
He
*NL*
shall
be
a
friend
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
THE
ENGLISH
SCISSORS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
girl
of
sixteen
had
a
pink
complexion
,
and
yet
*NL*
used
red
rouge
.
--
_
Polidori
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Fouque
's
offer
had
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
taken
away
all
Julien
's
*NL*
happiness
;
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
any
definite
course
.
``
Alas
!
*NL*
perhaps
I
am
lacking
in
character
.
I
should
have
been
a
bad
soldier
of
*NL*
Napoleon
.
At
least
,
''
he
added
,
``
my
little
intrigue
with
the
mistress
of
*NL*
the
house
will
distract
me
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
for
him
,
even
in
this
little
subordinate
incident
,
his
inner
*NL*
emotions
quite
failed
to
correspond
with
his
flippant
words
.
He
was
*NL*
frightened
of
Madame
de
Renal
because
of
her
pretty
dress
.
In
his
*NL*
eyes
,
that
dress
was
a
vanguard
of
Paris
.
His
pride
refused
to
leave
*NL*
anything
to
chance
and
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
.
He
made
himself
*NL*
a
very
minute
plan
of
campaign
,
moulded
on
the
confidences
of
Fouque
,
*NL*
and
a
little
that
he
had
read
about
love
in
the
Bible
.
As
he
was
very
*NL*
nervous
,
though
he
did
not
admit
it
to
himself
,
he
wrote
down
this
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
alone
with
him
for
a
moment
in
the
drawing-room
on
*NL*
the
following
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
no
other
name
except
Julien
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
hero
was
at
a
loss
to
answer
so
nattering
a
question
.
This
*NL*
circumstance
had
not
been
anticipated
in
his
plan
.
If
he
had
not
been
*NL*
stupid
enough
to
have
made
a
plan
,
Julien
's
quick
wit
would
have
served
*NL*
him
well
,
and
the
surprise
would
only
have
intensified
the
quickness
of
*NL*
his
perception
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
clumsy
,
and
exaggerated
his
clumsiness
,
Madame
de
Renal
quickly
*NL*
forgave
him
.
She
attributed
it
to
a
charming
frankness
.
And
an
air
of
*NL*
frankness
was
the
very
thing
which
in
her
view
was
just
lacking
in
this
*NL*
man
who
was
acknowledged
to
have
so
much
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
little
tutor
of
yours
inspires
me
with
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
suspicion
,
''
said
Madame
Derville
to
her
sometimes
.
``
I
think
he
looks
as
*NL*
if
he
were
always
thinking
,
and
he
never
acts
without
calculation
.
He
*NL*
is
a
sly
fox
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
remained
profoundly
humiliated
by
the
misfortune
of
not
having
*NL*
known
what
answer
to
make
to
Madame
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
like
I
am
ought
to
make
up
for
this
check
!
''
and
seizing
the
*NL*
moment
when
they
were
passing
from
one
room
to
another
,
he
thought
it
*NL*
was
his
duty
to
give
Madame
de
Renal
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
have
been
less
tactful
,
nothing
less
agreeable
,
and
*NL*
nothing
more
imprudent
both
for
him
and
for
her
.
They
were
within
*NL*
an
inch
of
being
noticed
.
Madame
de
Renal
thought
him
mad
.
She
was
*NL*
frightened
,
and
above
all
,
shocked
.
This
stupidity
reminded
her
of
M.
*NL*
Valenod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
happen
to
me
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
if
I
were
alone
with
*NL*
him
?
''
All
her
virtue
returned
,
because
her
love
was
waning
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
so
arranged
it
that
one
of
her
children
always
remained
with
her
.
*NL*
Julien
found
the
day
very
tedious
,
and
passed
it
entirely
in
clumsily
*NL*
putting
into
operation
his
plan
of
seduction
.
He
did
not
look
at
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
on
a
single
occasion
without
that
look
having
a
reason
,
but
*NL*
nevertheless
he
was
not
sufficiently
stupid
to
fail
to
see
that
he
was
*NL*
not
succeeding
at
all
in
being
amiable
,
and
was
succeeding
even
less
in
*NL*
being
fascinating
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
did
not
recover
from
her
astonishment
at
finding
him
*NL*
so
awkward
and
at
the
same
time
so
bold
.
``
It
is
the
timidity
of
love
*NL*
in
men
of
intellect
,
''
she
said
to
herself
with
an
inexpressible
joy
.
*NL*
``
Could
it
be
possible
that
he
had
never
been
loved
by
my
rival
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
Madame
de
Renal
went
back
to
the
drawing-room
to
*NL*
receive
the
visit
of
M.
Charcot
de
Maugiron
,
the
sub-prefect
of
Bray
.
*NL*
She
was
working
at
a
little
frame
of
fancy-work
some
distance
from
the
*NL*
ground
.
Madame
Derville
was
at
her
side
;
that
was
how
she
was
placed
*NL*
when
our
hero
thought
it
suitable
to
advance
his
boot
in
the
full
*NL*
light
and
press
the
pretty
foot
of
Madame
de
Renal
,
whose
open-work
*NL*
stockings
,
and
pretty
Paris
shoe
were
evidently
attracting
the
looks
of
*NL*
the
gallant
sub-prefect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
very
much
afraid
,
and
let
fall
her
scissors
,
her
*NL*
ball
of
wool
and
her
needles
,
so
that
Julien
's
movement
could
be
passed
*NL*
for
a
clumsy
effort
,
intended
to
prevent
the
fall
of
the
scissors
,
*NL*
which
presumably
he
had
seen
slide
.
Fortunately
,
these
little
scissors
*NL*
of
English
steel
were
broken
,
and
Madame
de
Renal
did
not
spare
her
*NL*
regrets
that
Julien
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
nearer
to
her
.
``
You
*NL*
noticed
them
falling
before
I
did
--
you
could
have
prevented
it
,
*NL*
instead
,
all
your
zealousness
only
succeeding
in
giving
me
a
very
big
*NL*
kick
.
''
All
this
took
in
the
sub-perfect
,
but
not
Madame
Derville
.
``
That
*NL*
pretty
boy
has
very
silly
manners
,
''
she
thought
.
The
social
code
of
a
*NL*
provincial
capital
never
forgives
this
kind
of
lapse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
found
an
opportunity
of
saying
to
Julien
,
``
Be
prudent
,
*NL*
I
order
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
appreciated
his
own
clumsiness
.
He
was
upset
.
He
deliberated
*NL*
with
himself
for
a
long
time
,
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
he
*NL*
ought
to
be
angry
at
the
expression
``
I
order
you
.
''
He
was
silly
enough
*NL*
to
think
she
might
have
said
``
I
order
you
,
''
if
it
were
some
question
*NL*
concerning
the
children
's
education
,
but
in
answering
my
love
she
puts
*NL*
me
on
an
equality
.
It
is
impossible
to
love
without
equality
...
and
*NL*
all
his
mind
ran
riot
in
making
common-places
on
equality
.
He
angrily
*NL*
repeated
to
himself
that
verse
of
Corneille
which
Madame
Derville
had
*NL*
taught
him
some
days
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
L'amour
*NL*
les
egalites
,
et
ne
les
cherche
pas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
who
had
never
had
a
mistress
in
his
whole
life
,
but
yet
insisted
*NL*
on
playing
the
role
of
a
Don
Juan
,
made
a
shocking
fool
of
himself
all
*NL*
day
.
He
had
only
one
sensible
idea
.
Bored
with
himself
and
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
,
he
viewed
with
apprehension
the
advance
of
the
evening
when
he
*NL*
would
have
to
sit
by
her
side
in
the
darkness
of
the
garden
.
He
told
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
that
he
was
going
to
Verrieres
to
see
the
cure
.
He
left
after
*NL*
dinner
,
and
only
came
back
in
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Verrieres
Julien
found
M.
Chelan
occupied
in
moving
.
He
had
just
*NL*
been
deprived
of
his
living
;
the
curate
Maslon
was
replacing
him
.
*NL*
Julien
helped
the
good
cure
,
and
it
occurred
to
him
to
write
to
Fouque
*NL*
that
the
irresistible
mission
which
he
felt
for
the
holy
ministry
had
*NL*
previously
prevented
him
from
accepting
his
kind
offer
,
but
that
he
had
*NL*
just
seen
an
instance
of
injustice
,
and
that
perhaps
it
would
be
safer
*NL*
not
to
enter
into
Holy
Orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
congratulated
himself
on
his
subtlety
in
exploiting
the
*NL*
dismissal
of
the
cure
of
Verrieres
so
as
to
leave
himself
a
loop-hole
*NL*
for
returning
to
commerce
in
the
event
of
a
gloomy
prudence
routing
the
*NL*
spirit
of
heroism
from
his
mind
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
Julien
had
possessed
a
little
of
that
adroitness
on
which
he
so
*NL*
gratuitously
plumed
himself
,
he
could
have
congratulated
himself
the
*NL*
following
day
on
the
effect
produced
by
his
journey
to
Verrieres
.
His
*NL*
absence
had
caused
his
clumsiness
to
be
forgotten
.
But
on
that
day
*NL*
also
he
was
rather
sulky
.
He
had
a
ludicrous
idea
in
the
evening
,
and
*NL*
with
singular
courage
he
communicated
it
to
Madame
de
Renal
.
They
had
*NL*
scarcely
sat
down
in
the
garden
before
Julien
brought
his
mouth
near
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
's
ear
without
waiting
till
it
was
sufficiently
dark
and
*NL*
at
the
risk
of
compromising
her
terribly
,
said
to
her
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
to-night
,
at
two
o'clock
,
I
shall
go
into
your
room
,
I
must
*NL*
tell
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
trembled
lest
his
request
should
be
granted
.
His
rakish
pose
*NL*
weighed
him
down
so
terribly
that
if
he
could
have
followed
his
own
*NL*
inclination
he
would
have
returned
to
his
room
for
several
days
and
*NL*
refrained
from
seeing
the
ladies
any
more
.
He
realised
that
he
had
*NL*
spoiled
by
his
clever
conduct
of
last
evening
all
the
bright
prospects
*NL*
of
the
day
that
had
just
passed
,
and
was
at
his
wits
'
end
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
answered
the
impertinent
declaration
which
Julien
had
*NL*
dared
to
make
to
her
with
indignation
which
was
real
and
in
no
way
*NL*
exaggerated
.
He
thought
he
could
see
contempt
in
her
curt
reply
.
The
*NL*
expression
``
for
shame
,
''
had
certainly
occurred
in
that
whispered
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
went
to
the
children
's
room
under
the
pretext
of
having
*NL*
something
to
say
to
them
,
and
on
his
return
he
placed
himself
beside
*NL*
Madame
Derville
and
very
far
from
Madame
de
Renal
.
He
thus
deprived
*NL*
himself
of
all
possibility
of
taking
her
hand
.
The
conversation
was
*NL*
serious
,
and
Julien
acquitted
himself
very
well
,
apart
from
a
few
*NL*
moments
of
silence
during
which
he
was
cudgelling
his
brains
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ca
n't
I
invent
some
pretty
manoeuvre
,
''
he
said
to
himself
which
*NL*
will
force
Madame
de
Renal
to
vouchsafe
to
me
those
unambiguous
signs
*NL*
of
tenderness
which
a
few
days
ago
made
me
think
that
she
was
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
extremely
disconcerted
by
the
almost
desperate
plight
*NL*
to
which
he
had
brought
his
affairs
.
Nothing
,
however
,
would
have
*NL*
embarrassed
him
more
than
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
separated
at
midnight
,
his
pessimism
made
him
think
that
*NL*
he
enjoyed
Madame
Derville
's
contempt
,
and
that
probably
he
stood
no
*NL*
better
with
Madame
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
in
a
very
bad
temper
and
very
humiliated
,
Julien
did
not
sleep
.
*NL*
He
was
leagues
away
from
the
idea
of
giving
up
all
intriguing
and
*NL*
planning
,
and
of
living
from
day
to
day
with
Madame
de
Renal
,
and
of
*NL*
being
contented
like
a
child
with
the
happiness
brought
by
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
racked
his
brains
inventing
clever
manoeuvres
,
which
an
instant
*NL*
afterwards
he
found
absurd
,
and
,
to
put
it
shortly
,
was
very
unhappy
*NL*
when
two
o'clock
rang
from
the
castle
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
woke
him
up
like
the
cock
's
crow
woke
up
St.
Peter
.
The
most
*NL*
painful
episode
was
now
timed
to
begin
--
he
had
not
given
a
thought
to
*NL*
his
impertinent
proposition
,
since
the
moment
when
he
had
made
it
and
*NL*
it
had
been
so
badly
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
her
that
I
will
go
to
her
at
two
o'clock
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
as
he
got
up
,
``
I
may
be
inexperienced
and
coarse
,
as
the
son
*NL*
of
a
peasant
naturally
would
be
.
Madame
Derville
has
given
me
to
*NL*
understand
as
much
,
but
at
any
rate
,
I
will
not
be
weak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
reason
to
congratulate
himself
on
his
courage
,
for
he
had
*NL*
never
put
his
self-control
to
so
painful
a
test
.
As
he
opened
his
door
,
*NL*
he
was
trembling
to
such
an
extent
that
his
knees
gave
way
under
him
,
*NL*
and
he
was
forced
to
lean
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
without
shoes
;
he
went
and
listened
at
M.
de
Renal
's
door
,
and
*NL*
could
hear
his
snoring
.
He
was
disconsolate
,
he
had
no
longer
any
*NL*
excuse
for
not
going
to
her
room
.
But
,
Great
Heaven
!
What
was
he
to
do
*NL*
there
?
He
had
no
plan
,
and
even
if
he
had
had
one
,
he
felt
himself
so
*NL*
nervous
that
he
would
have
been
incapable
of
carrying
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eventually
,
suffering
a
thousand
times
more
than
if
he
had
been
walking
*NL*
to
his
death
,
he
entered
the
little
corridor
that
led
to
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
's
room
.
He
opened
the
door
with
a
trembling
hand
and
made
a
*NL*
frightful
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
light
;
a
night
light
was
burning
on
the
mantelpiece
.
He
*NL*
had
not
expected
this
new
misfortune
.
As
she
saw
him
enter
,
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
got
quickly
out
of
bed
.
``
Wretch
,
''
she
cried
.
There
was
a
*NL*
little
confusion
.
Julien
forgot
his
useless
plans
,
and
turned
to
his
*NL*
natural
role
.
To
fail
to
please
so
charming
a
woman
appeared
to
him
the
*NL*
greatest
of
misfortunes
.
His
only
answer
to
her
reproaches
was
to
throw
*NL*
himself
at
her
feet
while
he
kissed
her
knees
.
As
she
was
speaking
to
*NL*
him
with
extreme
harshness
,
he
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Julien
came
out
of
Madame
de
Renal
's
room
some
hours
afterwards
,
*NL*
one
could
have
said
,
adopting
the
conventional
language
of
the
novel
,
*NL*
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
desired
.
In
fact
,
he
owed
to
the
love
*NL*
he
had
inspired
,
and
to
the
unexpected
impression
which
her
alluring
*NL*
charms
had
produced
upon
him
,
a
victory
to
which
his
own
clumsy
tactics
*NL*
would
never
have
led
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
victim
that
he
was
of
a
distorted
pride
,
he
pretended
even
in
*NL*
the
sweetest
moments
to
play
the
role
of
a
man
accustomed
to
the
*NL*
subjugation
of
women
:
he
made
incredible
but
deliberate
efforts
to
*NL*
spoil
his
natural
charm
.
Instead
of
watching
the
transports
which
he
*NL*
was
bringing
into
existence
,
and
those
pangs
of
remorse
which
only
set
*NL*
their
keenness
into
fuller
relief
,
the
idea
of
duty
was
continually
*NL*
before
his
eyes
.
He
feared
a
frightful
remorse
,
and
eternal
ridicule
,
*NL*
if
he
departed
from
the
ideal
model
he
proposed
to
follow
.
In
a
word
,
*NL*
the
very
quality
which
made
Julien
into
a
superior
being
was
precisely
*NL*
that
which
prevented
him
from
savouring
the
happiness
which
was
placed
*NL*
within
his
grasp
.
It
's
like
the
case
of
a
young
girl
of
sixteen
with
a
*NL*
charming
complexion
who
is
mad
enough
to
put
on
rouge
before
going
to
a
*NL*
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mortally
terrified
by
the
apparition
of
Julien
,
Madame
de
Renal
was
*NL*
soon
a
prey
to
the
most
cruel
alarm
.
The
prayers
and
despair
of
Julien
*NL*
troubled
her
keenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
when
there
was
nothing
left
for
her
to
refuse
him
she
pushed
*NL*
Julien
away
from
her
with
a
genuine
indignation
,
and
straightway
threw
*NL*
herself
into
his
arms
.
There
was
no
plan
apparent
in
all
this
conduct
.
*NL*
She
thought
herself
eternally
damned
,
and
tried
to
hide
from
herself
*NL*
the
sight
of
hell
by
loading
Julien
with
the
wildest
caresses
.
In
a
*NL*
word
,
nothing
would
have
been
lacking
in
our
hero
's
happiness
,
not
even
*NL*
an
ardent
sensibility
in
the
woman
whom
he
had
just
captured
,
if
he
had
*NL*
only
known
how
to
enjoy
it
.
Julien
's
departure
did
not
in
any
way
bring
*NL*
to
an
end
those
ecstacies
which
thrilled
her
in
spite
of
herself
,
and
*NL*
those
troubles
of
remorse
which
lacerated
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
being
happy
--
being
loved
,
is
that
all
it
comes
to
?
''
This
was
*NL*
Julien
's
first
thought
as
he
entered
his
room
.
He
was
a
prey
to
the
*NL*
astonishment
and
nervous
anxiety
of
the
man
who
has
just
obtained
*NL*
what
he
has
long
desired
.
He
has
been
accustomed
to
desire
,
and
has
*NL*
no
longer
anything
to
desire
,
and
nevertheless
has
no
memories
.
Like
*NL*
a
soldier
coming
back
from
parade
.
Julien
was
absorbed
in
rehearsing
*NL*
the
details
of
his
conduct
.
``
Have
I
failed
in
nothing
which
I
owe
to
*NL*
myself
?
Have
I
played
my
part
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
a
part
!
the
part
of
a
man
accustomed
to
be
brilliant
with
*NL*
women
.

the

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
for
Julien
's
fame
,
Madame
de
Renal
had
been
too
agitated
and
*NL*
too
astonished
to
appreciate
the
stupidity
of
the
man
who
had
in
a
*NL*
single
moment
become
the
whole
to
world
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
she
said
to
herself
,
as
she
pressed
him
to
retire
when
*NL*
she
saw
the
dawn
break
,
``
if
my
husband
has
heard
the
noise
,
I
am
lost
.
''
*NL*
Julien
,
who
had
had
the
time
to
make
up
some
phrases
,
remembered
this
*NL*
one
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
regret
your
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
much
at
a
moment
like
this
,
but
I
should
not
regret
having
*NL*
known
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
thought
it
incumbent
on
his
dignity
to
go
back
to
his
room
in
*NL*
broad
daylight
and
with
deliberate
imprudence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
continuous
attention
with
which
he
kept
on
studying
his
slightest
*NL*
actions
with
the
absurd
idea
of
appearing
a
man
of
experience
had
only
*NL*
one
advantage
.
When
he
saw
Madame
de
Renal
again
at
breakfast
his
*NL*
conduct
was
a
masterpiece
of
prudence
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
her
,
she
could
not
look
at
him
without
blushing
up
to
the
eyes
,
*NL*
and
could
not
live
a
moment
without
looking
at
him
.
She
realised
her
*NL*
own
nervousness
,
and
her
efforts
to
hide
it
redoubled
.
Julien
only
*NL*
lifted
his
eyes
towards
her
once
.
At
first
Madame
de
Renal
admired
*NL*
his
prudence
:
soon
seeing
that
this
single
look
was
not
repealed
,
she
*NL*
became
alarmed
.
``
Could
it
be
that
he
does
not
love
me
?
''
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
.
``
Alas
!
I
am
quite
old
for
him
.
I
am
ten
years
older
than
he
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
passed
from
the
dining-room
to
the
garden
,
she
pressed
Julien
's
*NL*
hand
.
In
the
surprise
caused
by
so
singular
a
mark
of
love
,
he
regarded
*NL*
her
with
passion
,
for
he
had
thought
her
very
pretty
over
breakfast
,
*NL*
and
while
keeping
his
eyes
downcast
he
had
passed
his
time
in
thinking
*NL*
of
the
details
of
her
charms
.
This
look
consoled
Madame
de
Renal
.
It
*NL*
did
not
take
away
all
her
anxiety
,
but
her
anxiety
tended
to
take
away
*NL*
nearly
completely
all
her
remorse
towards
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
husband
had
noticed
nothing
at
breakfast
.
It
was
not
so
with
*NL*
Madame
Derville
.
She
thought
she
saw
Madame
de
Renal
on
the
point
of
*NL*
succumbing
.
During
the
whole
day
her
bold
and
incisive
friendship
*NL*
regaled
her
cousin
with
those
innuendoes
which
were
intended
to
paint
*NL*
in
hideous
colours
the
dangers
she
was
running
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
burning
to
find
herself
alone
with
Julien
.
She
*NL*
wished
to
ask
him
if
he
still
loved
her
.
In
spite
of
the
unalterable
*NL*
sweetness
of
her
character
,
she
was
several
times
on
the
point
of
*NL*
notifying
her
friend
how
officious
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Derville
arranged
things
so
adroitly
that
evening
in
the
garden
,
*NL*
that
she
found
herself
placed
between
Madame
de
Renal
and
Julien
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
,
who
had
thought
in
her
imagination
how
delicious
it
*NL*
would
be
to
press
Julien
's
hand
and
carry
it
to
her
lips
,
was
not
able
*NL*
to
address
a
single
word
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
hitch
increased
her
agitation
.
She
was
devoured
by
one
pang
of
*NL*
remorse
.
She
had
so
scolded
Julien
for
his
imprudence
in
coming
to
her
*NL*
room
on
the
preceding
night
,
that
she
trembled
lest
he
should
not
come
*NL*
to-night
.
She
left
the
garden
early
and
went
and
ensconced
herself
in
*NL*
her
room
,
but
not
being
able
to
control
her
impatience
,
she
went
and
*NL*
glued
her
ear
to
Julien
's
door
.
In
spite
of
the
uncertainty
and
passion
*NL*
which
devoured
her
,
she
did
not
dare
to
enter
.
This
action
seemed
*NL*
to
her
the
greatest
possible
meanness
,
for
it
forms
the
basis
of
a
*NL*
provincial
proverb
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servants
had
not
yet
all
gone
to
bed
.
Prudence
at
last
compelled
*NL*
her
to
return
to
her
room
.
Two
hours
of
waiting
were
two
centuries
of
*NL*
torture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
too
faithful
to
what
he
called
his
duty
to
fail
to
*NL*
accomplish
stage
by
stage
what
he
had
mapped
out
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
one
o'clock
struck
,
he
escaped
softly
from
his
room
,
assured
himself
*NL*
that
the
master
of
the
house
was
soundly
asleep
,
and
appeared
in
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
's
room
.
To-night
he
experienced
more
happiness
by
the
side
of
*NL*
his
love
,
for
he
thought
less
constantly
about
the
part
he
had
to
play
.
*NL*
He
had
eyes
to
see
,
and
ears
to
hear
.
What
Madame
de
Renal
said
to
him
*NL*
about
his
age
contributed
to
give
him
some
assurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
I
am
ten
years
older
than
you
.
How
can
you
love
me
?
''
she
*NL*
repeated
vaguely
,
because
the
idea
oppressed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
could
not
realise
her
happiness
,
but
he
saw
that
it
was
genuine
*NL*
and
he
forgot
almost
entirely
his
own
fear
of
being
ridiculous
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
foolish
thought
that
he
was
regarded
as
an
inferior
,
by
reason
of
*NL*
his
obscure
birth
,
disappeared
also
.
As
Julien
's
transports
reassured
*NL*
his
timid
mistress
,
she
regained
a
little
of
her
happiness
,
and
of
her
*NL*
power
to
judge
her
lover
.
Happily
,
he
had
not
,
on
this
occasion
,
that
*NL*
artificial
air
which
had
made
the
assignation
of
the
previous
night
a
*NL*
triumph
rather
than
a
pleasure
.
If
she
had
realised
his
concentration
*NL*
on
playing
a
part
that
melancholy
discovery
would
have
taken
away
all
*NL*
her
happiness
for
ever
.
She
could
only
have
seen
in
it
the
result
of
*NL*
the
difference
in
their
ages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Madame
de
Renal
had
never
thought
of
the
theories
of
love
,
*NL*
difference
in
age
is
next
to
difference
in
fortune
,
one
of
the
great
*NL*
commonplaces
of
provincial
witticisms
,
whenever
love
is
the
topic
of
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
days
Julien
surrendered
himself
with
all
the
ardour
of
his
*NL*
age
,
and
was
desperately
in
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
must
own
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
that
she
has
an
angelic
kindness
*NL*
of
soul
,
and
no
one
in
the
world
is
prettier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
almost
completely
given
up
playing
a
part
.
In
a
moment
of
*NL*
abandon
,
he
even
confessed
to
her
all
his
nervousness
.
This
confidence
*NL*
raised
the
passion
which
he
was
inspiring
to
its
zenith
.
``
And
I
have
no
*NL*
lucky
rival
after
all
,
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
to
herself
with
delight
.
*NL*
She
ventured
to
question
him
on
the
portrait
in
which
he
used
to
be
so
*NL*
interested
.
Julien
swore
to
her
that
it
was
that
of
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Madame
de
Renal
had
enough
presence
of
mind
left
to
reflect
,
she
*NL*
did
not
recover
from
her
astonishment
that
so
great
a
happiness
could
*NL*
exist
;
and
that
she
had
never
had
anything
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
if
I
had
only
known
Julien
ten
years
ago
*NL*
when
I
was
still
considered
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
far
from
having
thoughts
like
these
.
His
love
was
still
*NL*
akin
to
ambition
.
It
was
the
joy
of
possessing
,
poor
,
unfortunate
and
*NL*
despised
as
he
was
,
so
beautiful
a
woman
.
His
acts
of
devotion
,
and
his
*NL*
ecstacies
at
the
sight
of
his
mistress
's
charms
finished
by
reassuring
*NL*
her
a
little
with
regard
to
the
difference
of
age
.
If
she
had
possessed
*NL*
a
little
of
that
knowledge
of
life
which
the
woman
of
thirty
has
*NL*
enjoyed
in
the
more
civilised
of
countries
for
quite
a
long
time
,
she
*NL*
would
have
trembled
for
the
duration
of
a
love
,
which
only
seemed
to
*NL*
thrive
on
novelty
and
the
intoxication
of
a
young
man
's
vanity
.
In
*NL*
those
moments
when
he
forgot
his
ambition
,
Julien
admired
ecstatically
*NL*
even
the
hats
and
even
the
dresses
of
Madame
de
Renal
.
He
could
not
*NL*
sate
himself
with
the
pleasure
of
smelling
their
perfume
.
He
would
open
*NL*
her
mirrored
cupboard
,
and
remain
hours
on
end
admiring
the
beauty
and
*NL*
the
order
of
everything
that
he
found
there
.
His
love
leaned
on
him
and
*NL*
looked
at
him
.
He
was
looking
at
those
jewels
and
those
dresses
which
*NL*
had
had
been
her
wedding
presents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
have
married
a
man
like
that
,
''
thought
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
sometimes
.
``
What
a
fiery
soul
!
What
a
delightful
life
one
would
have
*NL*
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Julien
,
he
had
never
been
so
near
to
those
terrible
instruments
*NL*
of
feminine
artillery
.
``
It
is
impossible
,
''
he
said
to
himself
``
for
*NL*
there
to
be
anything
more
beautiful
in
Paris
.
''
He
could
find
no
flaw
*NL*
in
his
happiness
.
The
sincere
admiration
and
ecstacies
of
his
mistress
*NL*
would
frequently
make
him
forget
that
silly
pose
which
had
rendered
*NL*
him
so
stiff
and
almost
ridiculous
during
the
first
moments
of
the
*NL*
intrigue
.
There
were
moments
where
,
in
spite
of
his
habitual
hypocrisy
,
*NL*
he
found
an
extreme
delight
in
confessing
to
this
great
lady
who
*NL*
admired
him
,
his
ignorance
of
a
crowd
of
little
usages
.
His
mistress
's
*NL*
rank
seemed
to
lift
him
above
himself
.
Madame
de
Renal
,
on
her
side
,
*NL*
would
find
the
sweetest
thrill
of
intellectual
voluptuousness
in
thus
*NL*
instructing
in
a
number
of
little
things
this
young
man
who
was
so
full
*NL*
of
genius
,
and
who
was
looked
upon
by
everyone
as
destined
one
day
to
*NL*
go
so
far
.
Even
the
sub-prefect
and
M.
Valenod
could
not
help
admiring
*NL*
him
.
She
thought
it
made
them
less
foolish
.
As
for
Madame
Derville
,
she
*NL*
was
very
far
from
being
in
a
position
to
express
the
same
sentiments
.
*NL*
Rendered
desperate
by
what
she
thought
she
divined
,
and
seeing
that
*NL*
her
good
advice
was
becoming
offensive
to
a
woman
who
had
literally
*NL*
lost
her
head
,
she
left
Vergy
without
giving
the
explanation
,
which
*NL*
her
friend
carefully
refrained
from
asking
.
Madame
de
Renal
shed
a
few
*NL*
tears
for
her
,
and
soon
found
her
happiness
greater
than
ever
.
As
a
*NL*
result
of
her
departure
,
she
found
herself
alone
with
her
lover
nearly
*NL*
the
whole
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
abandoned
himself
all
the
more
to
the
delightful
society
of
his
*NL*
sweetheart
,
since
,
whenever
he
was
alone
,
Fouque
's
fatal
proposition
*NL*
still
continued
to
agitate
him
.
During
the
first
days
of
his
novel
life
*NL*
there
were
moments
when
the
man
who
had
never
loved
,
who
had
never
been
*NL*
loved
by
anyone
,
would
find
so
delicious
a
pleasure
in
being
sincere
,
*NL*
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
confessing
to
Madame
de
Renal
that
ambition
*NL*
which
up
to
then
had
been
the
very
essence
of
his
existence
.
He
would
*NL*
have
liked
to
have
been
able
to
consult
her
on
the
strange
temptation
*NL*
which
Fouque
's
offer
held
out
to
him
,
but
a
little
episode
rendered
any
*NL*
frankness
impossible
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
FIRST
DEPUTY
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
how
this
spring
of
love
resembleth
*NL*
The
uncertain
glory
of
an
April
day
,
*NL*
Which
now
shows
all
the
beauty
of
the
sun
,
*NL*
And
by
and
by
a
cloud
takes
all
away
.
*NL*
_
Two
Gentlemen
of
Verona
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
when
the
sun
was
setting
,
and
he
was
sitting
near
his
love
,
*NL*
at
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
,
far
from
all
intruders
,
he
meditated
*NL*
deeply
.
``
Will
such
sweet
moments
''
he
said
to
himself
``
last
for
ever
?
''
*NL*
His
soul
was
engrossed
in
the
difficulty
of
deciding
on
a
calling
.
He
*NL*
lamented
that
great
attack
of
unhappiness
which
comes
at
the
end
of
*NL*
childhood
and
spoils
the
first
years
of
youth
in
those
who
are
not
rich
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
was
not
Napoleon
the
heaven-sent
saviour
for
young
*NL*
Frenchmen
?
Who
is
to
replace
him
?
What
will
those
unfortunate
youths
*NL*
do
without
him
,
who
,
even
though
they
are
richer
than
I
am
,
have
only
*NL*
just
the
few
crowns
necessary
to
procure
an
education
for
themselves
,
*NL*
but
have
not
at
the
age
of
twenty
enough
money
to
buy
a
man
and
advance
*NL*
themselves
in
their
career
.
''
``
Whatever
one
does
,
''
he
added
,
with
a
deep
*NL*
sigh
,
``
this
fatal
memory
will
always
prevent
our
being
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
saw
Madame
de
Renal
frown
.
She
assumed
a
cold
and
*NL*
disdainful
air
.
She
thought
his
way
of
looking
at
things
typical
of
a
*NL*
servant
.
Brought
up
as
she
was
with
the
idea
that
she
was
very
rich
,
*NL*
she
took
it
for
granted
that
Julien
was
so
also
.
She
loved
him
a
*NL*
thousand
times
more
than
life
and
set
no
store
by
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
far
from
guessing
these
ideas
,
but
that
frown
brought
him
*NL*
back
to
earth
.
He
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
manipulate
his
*NL*
phrases
,
and
to
give
the
noble
lady
who
was
sitting
so
near
him
on
the
*NL*
grass
seat
to
understand
that
the
words
he
had
just
repeated
had
been
*NL*
heard
by
him
during
his
journey
to
his
friend
the
wood
merchant
.
It
was
*NL*
the
logic
of
infidels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
nothing
to
do
with
those
people
,
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
,
*NL*
still
keeping
a
little
of
that
icy
air
which
had
suddenly
succeeded
an
*NL*
expression
of
the
warmest
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
frown
,
or
rather
his
remorse
for
his
own
imprudence
,
was
the
*NL*
first
check
to
the
illusion
which
was
transporting
Julien
.
He
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
She
is
good
and
sweet
,
she
has
a
great
fancy
for
me
,
but
she
*NL*
has
been
brought
up
in
the
enemy
's
camp
.
They
must
be
particularly
*NL*
afraid
of
that
class
of
men
of
spirit
who
,
after
a
good
education
,
have
*NL*
not
enough
money
to
take
up
a
career
.
What
would
become
of
those
nobles
*NL*
if
we
had
an
opportunity
of
fighting
them
with
equal
arms
.
Suppose
me
,
*NL*
for
example
,
mayor
of
Verrieres
,
and
as
well
meaning
and
honest
as
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
is
at
bottom
.
What
short
shrift
I
should
make
of
the
vicaire
,
*NL*
M.
Valenod
and
all
their
jobberies
!
How
justice
would
triumph
in
*NL*
Verrieres
.
It
is
not
their
talents
which
would
stop
me
.
They
are
always
*NL*
fumbling
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
Julien
's
happiness
almost
became
permanent
.
Our
hero
lacked
*NL*
the
power
of
daring
to
be
sincere
.
He
ought
to
have
had
the
courage
to
*NL*
have
given
battle
,
and
on
the
spot
;
Madame
de
Renal
had
been
astonished
*NL*
by
Julien
's
phrase
,
because
the
men
in
her
circle
kept
on
repeating
*NL*
that
the
return
of
Robespierre
was
essentially
possible
by
reason
of
*NL*
those
over-educated
young
persons
of
the
lower
classes
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
's
coldness
lasted
a
longish
time
,
and
struck
Julien
as
marked
.
*NL*
The
reason
was
that
the
fear
that
she
had
said
something
in
some
way
or
*NL*
other
disagreeable
to
him
,
succeeded
her
annoyance
for
his
own
breach
*NL*
of
taste
.
This
unhappiness
was
vividly
reflected
in
those
features
*NL*
which
looked
so
pure
and
so
naive
when
she
was
happy
and
away
from
*NL*
intruders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
no
longer
dared
to
surrender
himself
to
his
dreams
.
Growing
*NL*
calmer
and
less
infatuated
,
he
considered
that
it
was
imprudent
to
go
*NL*
and
see
Madame
de
Renal
in
her
room
.
It
was
better
for
her
to
come
to
*NL*
him
.
If
a
servant
noticed
her
going
about
the
house
,
a
dozen
different
*NL*
excuses
could
explain
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
arrangement
had
also
its
inconveniences
.
Julien
had
received
*NL*
from
Fouque
some
books
,
which
he
,
as
a
theology
student
would
never
*NL*
have
dared
to
ask
for
in
a
bookshop
.
He
only
dared
to
open
them
at
*NL*
night
.
He
would
often
have
found
it
much
more
convenient
not
to
be
*NL*
interrupted
by
a
visit
,
the
very
waiting
for
which
had
even
on
the
*NL*
evening
before
the
little
scene
in
the
orchard
completely
destroyed
his
*NL*
mood
for
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
Madame
de
Renal
to
thank
for
understanding
books
in
quite
a
new
*NL*
way
.
He
had
dared
to
question
her
on
a
number
of
little
things
,
the
*NL*
ignorance
of
which
cuts
quite
short
the
intellectual
progress
of
any
*NL*
young
man
born
out
of
society
,
however
much
natural
genius
one
may
*NL*
choose
to
ascribe
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
education
given
through
sheer
love
by
a
woman
who
was
extremely
*NL*
ignorant
,
was
a
piece
of
luck
.
Julien
managed
to
get
a
clear
insight
*NL*
into
society
such
as
it
is
to-day
.
His
mind
was
not
bewildered
by
the
*NL*
narration
of
what
it
had
been
once
,
two
thousand
years
ago
,
or
even
*NL*
sixty
years
ago
,
in
the
time
of
Voltaire
and
Louis
XV
.
The
scales
fell
*NL*
from
his
eyes
to
his
inexpressible
joy
,
and
he
understood
at
last
what
*NL*
was
going
on
in
Verrieres
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
there
were
the
very
complicated
intrigues
which
*NL*
had
been
woven
for
the
last
two
years
around
the
prefect
of
Besancon
.
*NL*
They
were
backed
up
by
letters
from
Paris
,
written
by
the
cream
of
*NL*
the
aristocracy
.
The
scheme
was
to
make
M.
de
Moirod
-LRB-
he
was
the
most
*NL*
devout
man
in
the
district
-RRB-
the
first
and
not
the
second
deputy
of
the
*NL*
mayor
of
Verrieres
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
for
a
competitor
a
very
rich
manufacturer
whom
it
was
essential
*NL*
to
push
back
into
the
place
of
second
deputy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
understood
at
last
the
innuendoes
which
he
had
surprised
,
*NL*
when
the
high
society
of
the
locality
used
to
come
and
dine
at
M.
de
*NL*
Renal
's
.
This
privileged
society
was
deeply
concerned
with
the
choice
*NL*
of
a
first
deputy
,
while
the
rest
of
the
town
,
and
above
all
,
the
*NL*
Liberals
,
did
not
even
suspect
its
possibility
.
The
factor
which
made
*NL*
the
matter
important
was
that
,
as
everybody
knows
,
the
east
side
of
the
*NL*
main
street
of
Verrieres
has
to
be
put
more
than
nine
feet
back
since
*NL*
that
street
has
become
a
royal
route
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
if
M.
de
Moirod
,
who
had
three
houses
liable
to
have
their
frontage
*NL*
put
back
,
succeeded
in
becoming
first
deputy
and
consequently
mayor
in
*NL*
the
event
of
M.
de
Renal
being
elected
to
the
chamber
,
he
would
shut
*NL*
his
eyes
,
and
it
would
be
possible
to
make
little
imperceptible
repairs
*NL*
in
the
houses
projecting
on
to
the
public
road
,
as
the
result
of
which
*NL*
they
would
last
a
hundred
years
.
In
spite
of
the
great
piety
and
proved
*NL*
integrity
of
M.
de
Moirod
,
everyone
was
certain
that
he
would
prove
*NL*
amenable
,
because
he
had
a
great
many
children
.
Among
the
houses
liable
*NL*
to
have
their
frontage
put
back
nine
belonged
to
the
cream
of
Verrieres
*NL*
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Julien
's
eyes
this
intrigue
was
much
more
important
than
the
history
*NL*
of
the
battle
of
Fontenoy
,
whose
name
he
now
came
across
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
one
of
the
books
which
Fouque
had
sent
him
.
There
had
been
*NL*
many
things
which
had
astonished
Julien
since
the
time
five
years
ago
*NL*
when
he
had
started
going
to
the
cure
's
in
the
evening
.
But
discretion
*NL*
and
humility
of
spirit
being
the
primary
qualities
of
a
theological
*NL*
student
,
it
had
always
been
impossible
for
him
to
put
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Madame
de
Renal
was
giving
an
order
to
her
husband
's
valet
who
*NL*
was
Julien
's
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Madame
,
to-day
is
the
last
Friday
in
the
month
,
''
the
man
answered
*NL*
in
a
rather
strange
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Julien
,
``
I
suppose
he
's
going
to
go
to
that
corn
shop
*NL*
which
was
once
a
church
,
and
has
recently
been
restored
to
religion
,
*NL*
but
what
is
he
going
to
do
there
?
That
's
one
of
the
mysteries
which
I
*NL*
have
never
been
able
to
fathom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
very
literary
institution
,
but
a
very
curious
one
,
''
answered
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
.
``
Women
are
not
admitted
to
it
.
All
I
know
is
,
that
*NL*
everybody
uses
the
second
person
singular
.
This
servant
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
will
go
and
meet
M.
Valenod
there
,
and
the
haughty
prig
will
not
be
*NL*
a
bit
offended
at
hearing
himself
addressed
by
Saint-Jean
in
that
*NL*
familiar
way
,
and
will
answer
him
in
the
same
way
.
If
you
are
keen
on
*NL*
knowing
what
takes
place
,
I
will
ask
M.
de
Maugiron
and
M.
Valenod
*NL*
for
details
.
We
pay
twenty
francs
for
each
servant
,
to
prevent
their
*NL*
cutting
our
throats
one
fine
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Time
flew
.
The
memory
of
his
mistress
's
charms
distracted
Julien
from
*NL*
his
black
ambition
.
The
necessity
of
refraining
from
mentioning
gloomy
*NL*
or
intellectual
topics
since
they
both
belonged
to
opposing
parties
,
*NL*
added
,
without
his
suspecting
it
,
to
the
happiness
which
he
owed
her
,
*NL*
and
to
the
dominion
which
she
acquired
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
occasions
when
the
presence
of
the
precocious
children
reduced
*NL*
them
to
speaking
the
language
of
cold
reason
,
Julien
looking
at
her
*NL*
with
eyes
sparkling
with
love
,
would
listen
with
complete
docility
to
*NL*
her
explanations
of
the
world
as
it
is
.
Frequently
,
in
the
middle
of
an
*NL*
account
of
some
cunning
piece
of
jobbery
,
with
reference
to
a
road
or
*NL*
a
contract
,
Madame
de
Renal
's
mind
would
suddenly
wander
to
the
very
*NL*
point
of
delirium
.
Julien
found
it
necessary
to
scold
her
.
She
indulged
*NL*
when
with
him
in
the
same
intimate
gestures
which
she
used
with
her
*NL*
own
children
.
The
fact
was
that
there
were
days
when
she
deceived
*NL*
herself
that
she
loved
him
like
her
own
child
.
Had
she
not
repeatedly
*NL*
to
answer
his
naive
questions
about
a
thousand
simple
things
that
a
*NL*
well-born
child
of
fifteen
knows
quite
well
?
An
instant
afterwards
*NL*
she
would
admire
him
like
her
master
.
His
genius
would
even
go
so
far
*NL*
as
to
frighten
her
.
She
thought
she
should
see
more
clearly
every
day
*NL*
the
future
great
man
in
this
young
abbe
.
She
saw
him
Pope
;
she
saw
him
*NL*
first
minister
like
Richelieu
.
``
Shall
I
live
long
enough
to
see
you
in
*NL*
your
glory
?
''
she
said
to
Julien
.
``
There
is
room
for
a
great
man
;
church
*NL*
and
state
have
need
of
one

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
A
KING
AT
VERRIERES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Do
you
not
deserve
to
be
thrown
aside
like
a
plebeian
*NL*
corpse
which
has
no
soul

whose
blood
flows
no

_
Sermon
of
the
Bishop
at
the
Chapel
of
Saint
Clement
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
3rd
of
September
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
a
gendarme
woke
*NL*
up
the
whole
of
Verrieres
by
galloping
up
the
main
street
.
He
brought
*NL*
the
news
that
His
Majesty
the
King
of
--
would
arrive
the
following
*NL*
Sunday
,
and
it
was
already
Tuesday
.
The
prefect
authorised
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
demanded
the
forming
of
a
guard
of
honour
.
They
were
to
exhibit
*NL*
all
possible
pomp
.
An
express
messenger
was
sent
to
Vergy
.
M.
de
Renal
*NL*
arrived
during
the
night
and
found
the
town
in
a
commotion
.
Each
*NL*
individual
had
his
own
pretensions
;
those
who
were
less
busy
hired
*NL*
balconies
to
see
the
King
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
was
to
command
the
Guard
of
Honour
?
M.
de
Renal
at
once
realised
*NL*
how
essential
it
was
in
the
interests
of
the
houses
liable
to
have
*NL*
their
frontage
put
back
that
M.
de
Moirod
should
have
the
command
.
*NL*
That
might
entitle
him
to
the
post
of
first
deputy-mayor
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
to
say
against
the
devoutness
of
M.
de
Moirod
.
It
brooked
*NL*
no
comparison
,
but
he
had
never
sat
on
a
horse
.
He
was
a
man
of
*NL*
thirty-six
,
timid
in
every
way
,
and
equally
frightened
of
falling
and
*NL*
of
looking
ridiculous
.
The
mayor
had
summoned
him
as
early
as
five
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
monsieur
,
I
ask
your
advice
,
as
though
you
already
occupy
*NL*
that
post
to
which
all
the
people
on
the
right
side
want
to
carry
you
.
*NL*
In
this
unhappy
town
,
manufacturers
are
prospering
,
the
Liberal
party
*NL*
is
becoming
possessed
of
millions
,
it
aspires
to
power
;
it
will
manage
*NL*
to
exploit
everything
to
its
own
ends
.
Let
us
consult
the
interests
of
*NL*
the
king
,
the
interest
of
the
monarchy
,
and
above
all
,
the
interest
of
*NL*
our
holy
religion
.
Who
do
you
think
,
monsieur
,
could
be
entrusted
with
*NL*
the
command
of
the
guard
of
honour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
terrible
fear
with
which
horses
inspired
him
,
M.
de
*NL*
Moirod
finished
by
accepting
this
honour
like
a
martyr
.
``
I
shall
know
*NL*
how
to
take
the
right
tone
,
''
he
said
to
the
mayor
.
There
was
scarcely
*NL*
time
enough
to
get
ready
the
uniforms
which
had
served
seven
years
ago
*NL*
on
the
occasion
of
the
passage
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
seven
o'clock
,
Madame
de
Renal
arrived
at
Vergy
with
Julien
and
*NL*
the
children
.
She
found
her
drawing
room
filled
with
Liberal
ladies
*NL*
who
preached
the
union
of
all
parties
and
had
come
to
beg
her
to
urge
*NL*
her
husband
to
grant
a
place
to
theirs
in
the
guard
of
honour
.
One
of
*NL*
them
actually
asserted
that
if
her
husband
was
not
chosen
he
would
go
*NL*
bankrupt
out
of
chagrin
.
Madame
de
Renal
quickly
got
rid
of
all
these
*NL*
people
.
She
seemed
very
engrossed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
astonished
,
and
what
was
more
,
angry
that
she
should
make
*NL*
a
mystery
of
what
was
disturbing
her
,
``
I
had
anticipated
it
,
''
he
said
*NL*
bitterly
to
himself
.
``
Her
love
is
being
over-shadowed
by
the
happiness
*NL*
of
receiving
a
King
in
her
house
.
All
this
hubbub
overcomes
her
.
She
*NL*
will
love
me
once
more
when
the
ideas
of
her
caste
no
longer
trouble
*NL*
her
brain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
astonishing
fact
,
he
only
loved
her
the
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
decorators
began
to
fill
the
house
.
He
watched
a
long
time
for
the
*NL*
opportunity
to
exchange
a
few
words
.
He
eventually
found
her
as
she
was
*NL*
coming
out
of
his
own
room
,
carrying
one
of
his
suits
.
They
were
alone
.
*NL*
He
tried
to
speak
to
her
.
She
ran
away
,
refusing
to
listen
to
him
.
``
I
*NL*
am
an
absolute
fool
to
love
a
woman
like
that
,
whose
ambition
renders
*NL*
her
as
mad
as
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
madder
.
One
of
her
great
wishes
which
she
had
never
confessed
*NL*
to
Julien
for
fear
of
shocking
him
,
was
to
see
him
leave
off
,
if
only
*NL*
for
one
day
,
his
gloomy
black
suit
.
With
an
adroitness
which
was
truly
*NL*
admirable
in
so
ingenuous
a
woman
,
she
secured
first
from
M.
de
Moirod
,
*NL*
and
subsequently
,
from
M.
the
sub-perfect
de
Maugiron
,
an
assurance
*NL*
that
Julien
should
be
nominated
a
guard
of
honour
in
preference
to
five
*NL*
or
six
young
people
,
the
sons
of
very
well-off
manufacturers
,
of
whom
*NL*
two
at
least
,
were
models
of
piety
.
M.
de
Valenod
,
who
reckoned
on
*NL*
lending
his
carriage
to
the
prettiest
women
in
the
town
,
and
on
showing
*NL*
off
his
fine
Norman
steeds
,
consented
to
let
Julien
-LRB-
the
being
he
hated
*NL*
most
in
the
whole
world
-RRB-
have
one
of
his
horses
.
But
all
the
guards
of
*NL*
honour
,
either
possessed
or
had
borrowed
,
one
of
those
pretty
sky-blue
*NL*
uniforms
,
with
two
silver
colonel
epaulettes
,
which
had
shone
seven
*NL*
years
ago
.
Madame
de
Renal
wanted
a
new
uniform
,
and
she
only
had
four
*NL*
days
in
which
to
send
to
Besancon
and
get
from
there
the
uniform
,
the
*NL*
arms
,
the
hat
,
etc.
,
everything
necessary
for
a
Guard
of
Honour
.
The
*NL*
most
delightful
part
of
it
was
that
she
thought
it
imprudent
to
get
*NL*
Julien
's
uniform
made
at
Verrieres
.
She
wanted
to
surprise
both
him
and
*NL*
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
settled
the
questions
of
the
guards
of
honour
,
and
of
the
public
*NL*
welcome
finished
,
the
mayor
had
now
to
organise
a
great
religious
*NL*
ceremony
.
The
King
of
--
did
not
wish
to
pass
through
Verrieres
*NL*
without
visiting
the
famous
relic
of
St.
Clement
,
which
is
kept
at
*NL*
Bray-le-Haut
barely
a
league
from
the
town
.
The
authorities
wanted
*NL*
to
have
a
numerous
attendance
of
the
clergy
,
but
this
matter
was
the
*NL*
most
difficult
to
arrange
.
M.
Maslon
,
the
new
cure
,
wanted
to
avoid
at
*NL*
any
price
the
presence
of
M.
Chelan
.
It
was
in
vain
that
M.
de
Renal
*NL*
tried
to
represent
to
him
that
it
would
be
imprudent
to
do
so
.
M.
the
*NL*
Marquis
de
La
Mole
whose
ancestors
had
been
governors
of
the
province
*NL*
for
so
many
generations
,
had
been
chosen
to
accompany
the
King
of
--
.
*NL*
He
had
known
the
abbe
Chelan
for
thirty
years
.
He
would
certainly
ask
*NL*
news
of
him
when
he
arrived
at
Verrieres
,
and
if
he
found
him
disgraced
*NL*
he
was
the
very
man
to
go
and
route
him
out
in
the
little
house
to
*NL*
which
he
had
retired
,
accompanied
by
all
the
escort
that
he
had
at
his
*NL*
disposition
.
What
a
rebuff
that
would
be
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
disgraced
both
here
and
at
Besancon
,
''
answered
the
abbe
*NL*
Maslon
,
``
if
he
appears
among
my
clergy
.
A
Jansenist
,
by
the
Lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
you
can
say
,
my
dear
abbe
,
''
replied
M.
de
Renal
,
``
I
'll
never
*NL*
expose
the
administration
of
Verrieres
to
receiving
such
an
affront
*NL*
from
M.
de
la
Mole
.
You
do
not
know
him
.
He
is
orthodox
enough
at
*NL*
Court
,
but
here
in
the
provinces
,
he
is
a
satirical
wit
and
cynic
,
*NL*
whose
only
object
is
to
make
people
uncomfortable
.
He
is
capable
of
*NL*
covering
us
with
ridicule
in
the
eyes
of
the
Liberals
,
simply
in
order
*NL*
to
amuse
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
on
the
night
between
the
Saturday
and
the
Sunday
,
after
*NL*
three
whole
days
of
negotiations
that
the
pride
of
the
abbe
Maslon
bent
*NL*
before
the
fear
of
the
mayor
,
which
was
now
changing
into
courage
.
It
*NL*
was
necessary
to
write
a
honeyed
letter
to
the
abbe
Chelan
,
begging
*NL*
him
to
be
present
at
the
ceremony
in
connection
with
the
relic
of
*NL*
Bray-le-Haut
,
if
of
course
,
his
great
age
and
his
infirmity
allowed
him
*NL*
to
do
so
.
M.
Chelan
asked
for
and
obtained
a
letter
of
invitation
for
*NL*
Julien
,
who
was
to
accompany
him
as
his
sub-deacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
beginning
of
the
Sunday
morning
,
thousands
of
peasants
began
*NL*
to
arrive
from
the
neighbouring
mountains
,
and
to
inundate
the
streets
*NL*
of
Verrieres
.
It
was
the
finest
sunshine
.
Finally
,
about
three
o'clock
,
*NL*
a
thrill
swept
through
all
this
crowd
.
A
great
fire
had
been
perceived
*NL*
on
a
rock
two
leagues
from
Verrieres
.
This
signal
announced
that
the
*NL*
king
had
just
entered
the
territory
of
the
department
.
At
the
same
*NL*
time
,
the
sound
of
all
the
bells
and
the
repeated
volleys
from
an
old
*NL*
Spanish
cannon
which
belonged
to
the
town
,
testified
to
its
joy
at
*NL*
this
great
event
.
Half
the
population
climbed
on
to
the
roofs
.
All
the
*NL*
women
were
on
the
balconies
.
The
guard
of
honour
started
to
march
,
The
*NL*
brilliant
uniforms
were
universally
admired
;
everybody
recognised
a
*NL*
relative
or
a
friend
.
They
made
fun
of
the
timidity
of
M.
de
Moirod
,
*NL*
whose
prudent
hand
was
ready
every
single
minute
to
catch
hold
of
his
*NL*
saddle-bow
.
But
one
remark
resulted
in
all
the
others
being
forgotten
;
*NL*
the
first
cavalier
in
the
ninth
line
was
a
very
pretty
,
slim
boy
,
who
*NL*
was
not
recognised
at
first
.
He
soon
created
a
general
sensation
,
as
*NL*
some
uttered
a
cry
of
indignation
,
and
others
were
dumbfounded
with
*NL*
astonishment
.
They
recognised
in
this
young
man
,
who
was
sitting
one
*NL*
of
the
Norman
horses
of
M.
Valenod
,
little
Sorel
,
the
carpenter
's
son
.
*NL*
There
was
a
unanimous
out-cry
against
the
mayor
,
above
all
on
the
part
*NL*
of
the
Liberals
.
What
,
because
this
little
labourer
,
who
masqueraded
as
*NL*
an
abbe
,
was
tutor
to
his
brats
,
he
had
the
audacity
to
nominate
him
*NL*
guard
of
honour
to
the
prejudice
of
rich
manufacturers
like
so-and-so
*NL*
and
so-and-so
!
``
Those
gentlemen
,
''
said
a
banker
's
wife
,
``
ought
to
put
*NL*
that
insolent
gutter-boy
in
his
proper
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
cunning
and
carries
a
sabre
,
''
answered
her
neighbour
.
``
He
would
*NL*
be
dastardly
enough
to
slash
them
in
the
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
of
aristocratic
society
was
more
dangerous
.
The
ladies
*NL*
began
to
ask
each
other
if
the
mayor
alone
was
responsible
for
this
*NL*
grave
impropriety
.
Speaking
generally
,
they
did
justice
to
his
contempt
*NL*
for
lack
of
birth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
the
happiest
of
men
,
while
he
was
the
subject
of
so
much
*NL*
conversation
.
Bold
by
nature
,
he
sat
a
horse
better
than
the
majority
*NL*
of
the
young
men
of
this
mountain
town
.
He
saw
that
,
in
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
women
,
he
was
the
topic
of
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
epaulettes
were
more
brilliant
than
those
of
the
others
,
because
*NL*
they
were
new
.
His
horse
pranced
at
every
moment
.
He
reached
the
zenith
*NL*
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
happiness
was
unbounded
when
,
as
they
passed
by
the
old
rampart
,
*NL*
the
noise
of
the
little
cannon
made
his
horse
prance
outside
the
line
.
*NL*
By
a
great
piece
of
luck
he
did
not
fall
;
from
that
moment
he
felt
*NL*
himself
a
hero
.
He
was
one
of
Napoleon
's
officers
of
artillery
,
and
was
*NL*
charging
a
battery
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
person
was
happier
than
he
.
She
had
first
seen
him
pass
from
one
*NL*
of
the
folding
windows
in
the
Hotel
de
Ville
.
Then
taking
her
carriage
*NL*
and
rapidly
making
a
long
detour
,
she
arrived
in
time
to
shudder
when
*NL*
his
horse
took
him
outside
the
line
.
Finally
she
put
her
carriage
to
*NL*
the
gallop
,
left
by
another
gate
of
the
town
,
succeeded
in
rejoining
*NL*
the
route
by
which
the
King
was
to
pass
,
and
was
able
to
follow
the
*NL*
Guard
of
Honour
at
twenty
paces
distance
in
the
midst
of
a
noble
dust
.
*NL*
Six
thousand
peasants
cried
``
Long
live
the
King
,
''
when
the
mayor
had
*NL*
the
honour
to
harangue
his
Majesty
.
An
hour
afterwards
,
when
all
the
*NL*
speeches
had
been
listened
to
,
and
the
King
was
going
to
enter
the
*NL*
town
,
the
little
cannon
began
again
to
discharge
its
spasmodic
volleys
.
*NL*
But
an
accident
ensued
,
the
victim
being
,
not
one
of
the
cannoneers
who
*NL*
had
proved
their
mettle
at
Leipsic
and
at
Montreuil
,
but
the
future
*NL*
deputy-mayor
,
M.
de
Moirod
.
His
horse
gently
laid
him
in
the
one
heap
*NL*
of
mud
on
the
high
road
,
a
somewhat
scandalous
circumstance
,
inasmuch
*NL*
as
it
was
necessary
to
extricate
him
to
allow
the
King
to
pass
.
His
*NL*
Majesty
alighted
at
the
fine
new
church
,
which
was
decked
out
to-day
*NL*
with
all
its
crimson
curtains
.
The
King
was
due
to
dine
,
and
then
*NL*
afterwards
take
his
carriage
again
and
go
and
pay
his
respects
to
the
*NL*
celebrated
relic
of
Saint
Clement
.
Scarcely
was
the
King
in
the
church
*NL*
than
Julien
galloped
towards
the
house
of
M.
de
Renal
.
Once
there
*NL*
he
doffed
with
a
sigh
his
fine
sky-blue
uniform
,
his
sabre
and
his
*NL*
epaulettes
,
to
put
on
again
his
shabby
little
black
suit
.
He
mounted
*NL*
his
horse
again
,
and
in
a
few
moments
was
at
Bray-le-Haut
,
which
was
*NL*
on
the
summit
of
a
very
pretty
hill
.
``
Enthusiasm
is
responsible
for
*NL*
these
numbers
of
peasants
,
''
thought
Julien
.
It
was
impossible
to
move
*NL*
a
step
at
Verrieres
,
and
here
there
were
more
than
ten
thousand
round
*NL*
this
ancient
abbey
.
Half
ruined
by
the
vandalism
of
the
Revolution
,
*NL*
it
had
been
magnificently
restored
since
the
Restoration
,
and
people
*NL*
were
already
beginning
to
talk
of
miracles
.
Julien
rejoined
the
abbe
*NL*
Chelan
,
who
scolded
him
roundly
and
gave
him
a
cassock
and
a
surplice
.
*NL*
He
dressed
quickly
and
followed
M.
Chelan
,
who
was
going
to
pay
a
call
*NL*
on
the
young
bishop
of
Agde
.
He
was
a
nephew
of
M.
de
la
Mole
,
who
had
*NL*
been
recently
nominated
,
and
had
been
charged
with
the
duty
of
showing
*NL*
the
relic
to
the
King
.
But
the
bishop
was
not
to
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clergy
began
to
get
impatient
.
It
was
awaiting
its
chief
in
the
*NL*
sombre
Gothic
cloister
of
the
ancient
abbey
.
Twenty-four
cures
had
*NL*
been
brought
together
so
as
to
represent
the
ancient
chapter
of
*NL*
Bray-le-Haut
,
which
before
1789
consisted
of
twenty-four
canons
.
The
*NL*
cures
,
having
deplored
the
bishop
's
youth
for
three-quarters
of
an
*NL*
hour
,
thought
it
fitting
for
their
senior
to
visit
Monseigneur
to
*NL*
apprise
him
that
the
King
was
on
the
point
of
arriving
,
and
that
it
was
*NL*
time
to
betake
himself
to
the
choir
.
The
great
age
of
M.
Chelan
gave
*NL*
him
the
seniority
.
In
spite
of
the
bad
temper
which
he
was
manifesting
*NL*
to
Julien
,
he
signed
him
to
follow
.
Julien
was
wearing
his
surplice
*NL*
with
distinction
.
By
means
of
some
trick
or
other
of
ecclesiastical
*NL*
dress
,
he
had
made
his
fine
curling
hair
very
flat
,
but
by
a
*NL*
forgetfulness
,
which
redoubled
the
anger
of
M.
Chelan
,
the
spurs
of
the
*NL*
Guard
of
Honour
could
be
seen
below
the
long
folds
of
his
cassock
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
arrived
at
the
bishop
's
apartment
,
the
tall
lackeys
with
*NL*
their
lace-frills
scarcely
deigned
to
answer
the
old
cure
to
the
effect
*NL*
that
Monseigneur
was
not
receiving
.
They
made
fun
of
him
when
he
tried
*NL*
to
explain
that
in
his
capacity
of
senior
member
of
the
chapter
of
*NL*
Bray-le-Haut
,
he
had
the
privilege
of
being
admitted
at
any
time
to
the
*NL*
officiating
bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
haughty
temper
was
shocked
by
the
lackeys
'
insolence
.
He
*NL*
started
to
traverse
the
corridors
of
the
ancient
abbey
,
and
to
shake
*NL*
all
the
doors
which
he
found
.
A
very
small
one
yielded
to
his
efforts
,
*NL*
and
he
found
himself
in
a
cell
in
the
midst
of
Monseigneur
's
valets
,
*NL*
who
were
dressed
in
black
suits
with
chains
on
their
necks
.
His
hurried
*NL*
manner
made
these
gentlemen
think
that
he
had
been
sent
by
the
bishop
,
*NL*
and
they
let
him
pass
.
He
went
some
steps
further
on
,
and
found
himself
*NL*
in
an
immense
Gothic
hall
,
which
was
extremely
dark
,
and
completely
*NL*
wainscotted
in
black
oak
.
The
ogive
windows
had
all
been
walled
in
*NL*
with
brick
except
one
.
There
was
nothing
to
disguise
the
coarseness
*NL*
of
this
masonry
,
which
offered
a
melancholy
contrast
to
the
ancient
*NL*
magnificence
of
the
woodwork
.
The
two
great
sides
of
this
hall
,
so
*NL*
celebrated
among
Burgundian
antiquaries
,
and
built
by
the
Duke
,
Charles
*NL*
the
Bold
,
about
1470
in
expiation
of
some
sin
,
were
adorned
with
richly
*NL*
sculptured
wooden
stalls
.
All
the
mysteries
of
the
Apocalypse
were
to
*NL*
be
seen
portrayed
in
wood
of
different
colours
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
melancholy
magnificence
,
debased
as
it
was
by
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
bare
bricks
and
the
plaster
-LRB-
which
was
still
quite
white
-RRB-
affected
*NL*
Julien
.
He
stopped
in
silence
.
He
saw
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
*NL*
hall
,
near
the
one
window
which
let
in
the
daylight
,
a
movable
mahogany
*NL*
mirror
.
A
young
man
in
a
violet
robe
and
a
lace
surplice
,
but
with
his
*NL*
head
bare
,
was
standing
still
three
paces
from
the
glass
.
This
piece
*NL*
of
furniture
seemed
strange
in
a
place
like
this
,
and
had
doubtless
*NL*
been
only
brought
there
on
the
previous
day
.
Julien
thought
that
the
*NL*
young
man
had
the
appearance
of
being
irritated
.
He
was
solemnly
giving
*NL*
benedictions
with
his
right
hand
close
to
the
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
this
mean
,
''
he
thought
.
``
Is
this
young
priest
performing
some
*NL*
preliminary
ceremony
?
Perhaps
he
is
the
bishop
's
secretary
.
He
will
be
*NL*
as
insolent
as
the
lackeys
.
Never
mind
though
!
Let
us
try
.
''
He
advanced
*NL*
and
traversed
somewhat
slowly
the
length
of
the
hall
,
with
his
gaze
*NL*
fixed
all
the
time
on
the
one
window
,
and
looking
at
the
young
man
who
*NL*
continued
without
any
intermission
bestowing
slowly
an
infinite
number
*NL*
of
blessings
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nearer
he
approached
the
better
he
could
distinguish
his
angry
*NL*
manner
.
The
richness
of
the
lace
surplice
stopped
Julien
in
spite
of
*NL*
himself
some
paces
in
front
of
the
mirror
.
``
It
is
my
duty
to
speak
,
''
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
at
last
.
But
the
beauty
of
the
hall
had
moved
him
,
and
*NL*
he
was
already
upset
by
the
harsh
words
he
anticipated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
saw
him
in
the
mirror
,
turned
round
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
discarding
his
angry
manner
,
said
to
him
in
the
gentlest
tone
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Monsieur
,
has
it
been
arranged
at
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
dumbfounded
.
As
the
young
man
began
to
turn
towards
him
,
*NL*
Julien
saw
the
pectoral
cross
on
his
breast
.
It
was
the
bishop
of
Agde
.
*NL*
``
As
young
as
that
,
''
thought
Julien
.
``
At
most
six
or
eight
years
older
*NL*
than
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
ashamed
of
his
spurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
I
am
sent
by
M.
Chelan
,
the
senior
of
*NL*
the
chapter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
has
been
well
recommended
to
me
,
''
said
the
bishop
in
a
polished
*NL*
tone
which
doubled
Julien
's
delight
,
``
But
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Monsieur
,
*NL*
I
mistook
you
for
the
person
who
was
to
bring
me
my
mitre
.
It
was
badly
*NL*
packed
at
Paris
.
The
silver
cloth
towards
the
top
has
been
terribly
*NL*
spoiled
.
It
will
look
awful
,
''
ended
the
young
bishop
sadly
,
``
And
*NL*
besides
,
I
am
being
kept
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
I
will
go
and
fetch
the
mitre
if
your
grace
will
let
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
fine
eyes
did
their
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
Monsieur
,
''
answered
the
bishop
,
with
charming
politeness
.
``
I
need
*NL*
it
immediately
.
I
am
grieved
to
keep
the
gentlemen
of
the
chapter
*NL*
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Julien
reached
the
centre
of
the
hall
,
he
turned
round
towards
the
*NL*
bishop
,
and
saw
that
he
had
again
commenced
giving
benedictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
it
be
?
''
Julien
asked
himself
.
``
No
doubt
it
is
a
necessary
*NL*
ecclesiastical
preliminary
for
the
ceremony
which
is
to
take
place
.
''
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
cell
in
which
the
valets
were
congregated
,
he
*NL*
saw
the
mitre
in
their
hands
.
These
gentlemen
succumbed
in
spite
of
*NL*
themselves
to
his
imperious
look
,
and
gave
him
Monseigneur
's
mitre
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
proud
to
carry
it
.
As
he
crossed
the
hall
he
walked
slowly
.
He
*NL*
held
it
with
reverence
.
He
found
the
bishop
seated
before
the
glass
,
*NL*
but
from
time
to
time
,
his
right
hand
,
although
fatigued
,
still
gave
a
*NL*
blessing
.
Julien
helped
him
to
adjust
his
mitre
.
The
bishop
shook
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
it
will
keep
on
,
''
he
said
to
Julien
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
mind
going
a
little
way
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
bishop
went
very
quickly
to
the
centre
of
the
room
,
then
*NL*
approached
the
mirror
,
again
resumed
his
angry
manner
,
and
gravely
*NL*
began
to
give
blessings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
motionless
with
astonishment
.
He
was
tempted
to
understand
,
*NL*
but
did
not
dare
.
The
bishop
stopped
,
and
suddenly
abandoning
his
grave
*NL*
manner
looked
at
him
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
my
mitre
,
monsieur
,
is
it
on
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
,
Monseigneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
too
far
back
?
That
would
look
a
little
silly
,
but
I
must
n't
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
wear
it
down
over
the
eyes
like
an
officer
's
shako
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
to
be
on
quite
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
King
of
--
is
accustomed
to
a
venerable
clergy
who
are
doubtless
*NL*
very
solemn
.
I
should
not
like
to
appear
lacking
in
dignity
,
especially
*NL*
by
reason
of
my
youth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
bishop
started
again
to
walk
about
and
give
benedictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
clear
,
''
said
Julien
,
daring
to
understand
at
last
,
``
He
is
*NL*
practising
giving
his
benediction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready
,
''
the
bishop
said
after
a
few
moments
.
``
Go
,
Monsieur
,
and
*NL*
advise
the
senior
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
chapter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
M.
Chelan
,
followed
by
the
two
oldest
cures
,
entered
by
a
big
*NL*
magnificently
sculptured
door
,
which
Julien
had
not
previously
noticed
.
*NL*
But
this
time
he
remained
in
his
place
quite
at
the
back
,
and
was
only
*NL*
able
to
see
the
bishop
over
the
shoulders
of
ecclesiastics
who
were
*NL*
pressing
at
the
door
in
crowds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bishop
began
slowly
to
traverse
the
hall
.
When
he
reached
the
*NL*
threshold
,
the
cures
formed
themselves
into
a
procession
.
After
a
short
*NL*
moment
of
confusion
,
the
procession
began
to
march
intoning
the
psalm
.
*NL*
The
bishop
,
who
was
between
M.
Chelan
and
a
very
old
cure
,
was
the
last
*NL*
to
advance
.
Julien
being
in
attendance
on
the
abbe
Chelan
managed
to
*NL*
get
quite
near
Monseigneur
.
They
followed
the
long
corridors
of
the
*NL*
abbey
of
Bray-le-Haut
.
In
spite
of
the
brilliant
sun
they
were
dark
and
*NL*
damp
.
They
arrived
finally
at
the
portico
of
the
cloister
.
Julien
was
*NL*
dumbfounded
with
admiration
for
so
fine
a
ceremony
.
His
emotions
were
*NL*
divided
between
thoughts
of
his
own
ambition
which
had
been
reawakened
*NL*
by
the
bishop
's
youth
and
thoughts
of
the
latter
's
refinement
and
*NL*
exquisite
politeness
.
This
politeness
was
quite
different
to
that
of
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
,
even
on
his
good
days
.
``
The
higher
you
lift
yourself
towards
*NL*
the
first
rank
of
society
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
,
``
the
more
charming
*NL*
manners
you
find
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
the
church
by
a
side
door
;
suddenly
an
awful
noise
made
*NL*
the
ancient
walls
echo
.
Julien
thought
they
were
going
to
crumble
.
It
*NL*
was
the
little
piece
of
artillery
again
.
It
had
been
drawn
at
a
gallop
*NL*
by
eight
horses
and
had
just
arrived
.
Immediately
on
its
arrival
it
had
*NL*
been
run
out
by
the
Leipsic
cannoneers
and
fired
five
shots
a
minute
as
*NL*
though
the
Prussians
had
been
the
target
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
admirable
noise
no
longer
produced
any
effect
on
Julien
.
He
no
*NL*
longer
thought
of
Napoleon
and
military
glory
.
``
To
be
bishop
of
Agde
so
*NL*
young
,
''
he
thought
.
``
But
where
is
Agde
?
How
much
does
it
bring
in
?
Two
*NL*
or
three
hundred
thousand
francs
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monseigneur
's
lackeys
appeared
with
a
magnificent
canopy
.
M.
Chelan
*NL*
took
one
of
the
poles
,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
Julien
who
*NL*
carried
it
.
The
bishop
took
his
place
underneath
.
He
had
really
*NL*
succeeded
in
looking
old
;
and
our
hero
's
admiration
was
now
quite
*NL*
unbounded
.
``
What
ca
n't
one
accomplish
with
skill
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
entered
.
Julien
had
the
good
fortune
to
see
him
at
close
*NL*
quarters
.
The
bishop
began
to
harangue
him
with
unction
,
without
*NL*
forgetting
a
little
nuance
of
very
polite
anxiety
for
his
Majesty
.
*NL*
We
will
not
repeat
a
description
of
the
ceremony
of
Bray-le-Haut
.
*NL*
They
filled
all
the
columns
of
the
journals
of
the
department
for
a
*NL*
fortnight
on
end
.
Julien
learnt
from
the
bishop
that
the
king
was
*NL*
descended
from
Charles
the
Bold
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
later
date
,
it
was
one
of
Julien
's
duties
to
check
the
accounts
*NL*
of
the
cost
of
this
ceremony
.
M.
de
la
Mole
,
who
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
procuring
a
bishopric
for
his
nephew
,
had
wished
to
do
him
the
favour
*NL*
of
being
himself
responsible
for
all
the
expenses
.
The
ceremony
alone
*NL*
of
Bray-le-Haute
cost
three
thousand
eight
hundred
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
speech
of
the
bishop
,
and
the
answer
of
the
king
,
his
*NL*
Majesty
took
up
a
position
underneath
the
canopy
,
and
then
knelt
very
*NL*
devoutly
on
a
cushion
near
the
altar
.
The
choir
was
surrounded
by
*NL*
stalls
,
and
the
stalls
were
raised
two
steps
from
the
pavement
.
It
*NL*
was
at
the
bottom
of
these
steps
that
Julien
sat
at
the
feet
of
M.
*NL*
de
Chelan
almost
like
a
train-bearer
sitting
next
to
his
cardinal
in
*NL*
the
Sixtine
chapel
at
Rome
.
There
was
a
_
Te
Deum
_
,
floods
of
incense
,
*NL*
innumerable
volleys
of
musketry
and
artillery
;
the
peasants
were
drunk
*NL*
with
happiness
and
piety
.
A
day
like
this
undoes
the
work
of
a
hundred
*NL*
numbers
of
the
Jacobin
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
six
paces
from
the
king
,
who
was
really
praying
with
*NL*
devotion
.
He
noticed
for
the
first
time
a
little
man
with
a
witty
*NL*
expression
,
who
wore
an
almost
plain
suit
.
But
he
had
a
sky-blue
ribbon
*NL*
over
this
very
simple
suit
.
He
was
nearer
the
king
than
many
other
*NL*
lords
,
whose
clothes
were
embroidered
with
gold
to
such
an
extent
that
,
*NL*
to
use
Julien
's
expression
,
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
cloth
.
He
*NL*
learnt
some
minutes
later
that
it
was
Monsieur
de
la
Mole
.
He
thought
*NL*
he
looked
haughty
,
and
even
insolent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
this
marquis
is
not
so
polite
as
my
pretty
bishop
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
``
Ah
,
the
ecclesiastical
calling
makes
men
mild
and
good
.
But
*NL*
the
king
has
come
to
venerate
the
relic
,
and
I
do
n't
see
a
trace
of
the
*NL*
relic
.
Where
has
Saint
Clement
got
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
priest
who
sat
next
to
him
informed
him
that
the
venerable
*NL*
relic
was
at
the
top
of
the
building
in
a
_
chapelle
ardente
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
a
_
chapelle
ardente
_
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
reluctant
to
ask
the
meaning
of
this
word
.
He
redoubled
his
*NL*
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
etiquette
on
the
occasion
of
a
visit
of
a
sovereign
prince
is
*NL*
that
the
canons
do
not
accompany
the
bishop
.
But
,
as
he
started
on
*NL*
his
march
to
the
_
chapelle
ardente
_
,
my
lord
bishop
of
Agde
called
*NL*
the
abbe
Chelan
.
Julien
dared
to
follow
him
.
Having
climbed
up
a
long
*NL*
staircase
,
they
reached
an
extremely
small
door
whose
Gothic
frame
*NL*
was
magnificently
gilded
.
This
work
looked
as
though
it
had
been
*NL*
constructed
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty-four
young
girls
belonging
to
the
most
distinguished
families
in
*NL*
Verrieres
were
assembled
in
front
of
the
door
.
The
bishop
knelt
down
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
these
pretty
maidens
before
he
opened
the
door
.
While
*NL*
he
was
praying
aloud
,
they
seemed
unable
to
exhaust
their
admiration
*NL*
for
his
fine
lace
,
his
gracious
mien
,
and
his
young
and
gentle
face
.
*NL*
This
spectacle
deprived
our
hero
of
his
last
remnants
of
reason
.
At
*NL*
this
moment
he
would
have
fought
for
the
Inquisition
,
and
with
a
good
*NL*
conscience
.
The
door
suddenly
opened
.
The
little
chapel
was
blazing
*NL*
with
light
.
More
than
a
thousand
candles
could
be
seen
before
the
*NL*
altar
,
divided
into
eight
lines
and
separated
from
each
other
by
*NL*
bouquets
of
flowers
.
The
suave
odour
of
the
purest
incense
eddied
*NL*
out
from
the
door
of
the
sanctuary
.
The
chapel
,
which
had
been
newly
*NL*
gilded
,
was
extremely
small
but
very
high
.
Julien
noticed
that
there
*NL*
were
candles
more
than
fifteen
feet
high
upon
the
altar
.
The
young
*NL*
girls
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
admiration
.
Only
the
twenty-four
*NL*
young
girls
,
the
two
cures
and
Julien
had
been
admitted
into
the
little
*NL*
vestibule
of
the
chapel
.
Soon
the
king
arrived
,
followed
by
Monsieur
*NL*
de
la
Mole
and
his
great
Chamberlain
.
The
guards
themselves
remained
*NL*
outside
kneeling
and
presenting
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
Majesty
precipitated
,
rather
than
threw
himself
,
on
to
the
stool
.
*NL*
It
was
only
then
that
Julien
,
who
was
keeping
close
to
the
gilded
*NL*
door
,
perceived
over
the
bare
arm
of
a
young
girl
,
the
charming
statue
*NL*
of
St.
Clement
.
It
was
hidden
under
the
altar
,
and
bore
the
dress
of
*NL*
a
young
Roman
soldier
.
It
had
a
large
wound
on
its
neck
,
from
which
*NL*
the
blood
seemed
to
flow
.
The
artist
had
surpassed
himself
.
The
eyes
,
*NL*
which
though
dying
were
full
of
grace
,
were
half
closed
.
A
budding
*NL*
moustache
adored
that
charming
mouth
which
,
though
half
closed
,
seemed
*NL*
notwithstanding
to
be
praying
.
The
young
girl
next
to
Julien
wept
warm
*NL*
tears
at
the
sight
.
One
of
her
tears
fell
on
Julien
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
of
prayer
in
the
profoundest
silence
,
that
was
only
*NL*
broken
by
the
distant
sound
of
the
bells
of
all
the
villages
within
a
*NL*
radius
of
ten
leagues
,
the
bishop
of
Agde
asked
the
king
's
permission
*NL*
to
speak
.
He
finished
a
short
but
very
touching
speech
with
a
passage
,
*NL*
the
very
simplicity
of
which
assured
its
effectiveness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
forget
,
young
Christian
women
,
that
you
have
seen
one
of
the
*NL*
greatest
kings
of
the
world
on
his
knees
before
the
servants
of
*NL*
this
Almighty
and
terrible
God
.
These
servants
,
feeble
,
persecuted
,
*NL*
assassinated
as
they
were
on
earth
,
as
you
can
see
by
the
still
*NL*
bleeding
wounds
of
Saint
Clement
,
will
triumph
in
Heaven
.
You
will
*NL*
remember
them
,
my
young
Christian
women
,
will
you
not
,
this
day
for
*NL*
ever
,
and
will
detest
the
infidel
.
You
will
be
for
ever
faithful
to
*NL*
this
God
who
is
so
great
,
so
terrible
,
but
so
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
the
bishop
rose
authoritatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
promise
me
?
''
he
said
,
lifting
up
his
arm
with
an
inspired
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
promise
,
''
said
the
young
girls
melting
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
accept
your
promise
in
the
name
of
the
terrible
God
,
''
added
the
*NL*
bishop
in
a
thunderous
voice
,
and
the
ceremony
was
at
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
himself
was
crying
.
It
was
only
a
long
time
afterwards
that
*NL*
Julien
had
sufficient
self-possession
to
enquire
``
where
were
the
bones
*NL*
of
the
Saint
that
had
been
sent
from
Rome
to
Philip
the
Good
,
Duke
of
*NL*
Burgundy
?
''
He
was
told
that
they
were
hidden
in
the
charming
waxen
*NL*
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
Majesty
deigned
to
allow
the
young
ladies
who
had
accompanied
him
*NL*
into
the
chapel
to
wear
a
red
ribbon
on
which
were
embroidered
these
*NL*
words
,
``
HATE
OF
THE
INFIDEL
.
PERPETUAL
ADORATION
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
de
la
Mole
had
ten
thousand
bottles
of
wine
distributed
among
*NL*
the
peasants
.
In
the
evening
at
Verrieres
,
the
Liberals
made
a
point
of
*NL*
having
illuminations
which
were
a
hundred
times
better
than
those
of
*NL*
the
Royalists
.
Before
leaving
,
the
king
paid
a
visit
to
M.
de
Moirod

As
he
was
replacing
the
usual
furniture
in
the
room
which
M.
de
la
*NL*
Mole
had
occupied
,
Julien
found
a
piece
of
very
strong
paper
folded
in
*NL*
four
.
He
read
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
page
``

It
was
a
petition
in
the
rough
hand-writing
of
a
cook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Marquis

I
have
had
religious
principles
*NL*
all
my

I
was
in
Lyons
exposed
to

bombs
at
*NL*
the
time
of

siege

in
'93
of
execrable
memory

I
have
never

cook
used
to
keep
servants

before

revolution

my
cook
fasts
on

I
am
*NL*
universally
respected
in
Verrieres

and
I
venture
to
*NL*
say
I
deserve
to
be
so

I
walk
under
the
canopy
in
the
*NL*
processions
at
the
side
of
the
cure
and
of
the
mayor

On

at

In
the
margin
of
this
petition
was
a
recommendation
signed
``
de
Moirod
''
*NL*
which
began
with
this
line
,
``
I
have
had
the
honour
,
the
worthy
person
*NL*
who
makes
this
request

``
So
even
that
imbecile

shows
me
the
way
to
go
about

said
Julien
to
himself
.

Eight
days
after
the
passage
of
the
King
of
--
through
Verrieres
,
*NL*
the
one
question
which
predominated
over
the
innumerable
falsehoods
,
*NL*
foolish
conjectures
,
and
ridiculous
discussions
,
etc.
,
etc.
,
which
had
*NL*
had
successively
for
their
object
the
king
,
the
Marquis
de
la
Mole
,
*NL*
the
ten
thousand
bottles
of
wine
,
the
fall
of
poor
de
Moirod
,
who
,
*NL*
hoping
to
win
a
cross
,
only
left
his
room
a
week
after
his
fall
,
was
*NL*
the
absolute
indecency
of
having
_
foisted
_
Julien
Sorel
,
a
carpenter
's
*NL*
son
,
into
the
Guard
of
Honour
.
You
should
have
heard
on
this
point
the
*NL*
rich
manufacturers
of
printed
calico
,
the
very
persons
who
used
to
bawl
*NL*
themselves
hoarse
in
preaching
equality
,
morning
and
evening
in
the
*NL*
cafe
.
That
haughty
woman
,
Madame
de
Renal
,
was
of
course
responsible
*NL*
for
this
abomination
.
The
reason
?
The
fine
eyes
and
fresh
complexion
of
*NL*
the
little
abbe
Sorel
explained
everything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
time
after
their
return
to
Vergy
,
Stanislas
,
the
youngest
of
*NL*
the
children
,
caught
the
fever
;
Madame
de
Renal
was
suddenly
attacked
*NL*
by
an
awful
remorse
.
For
the
first
time
she
reproached
herself
for
her
*NL*
love
with
some
logic
.
She
seemed
to
understand
as
though
by
a
miracle
*NL*
the
enormity
of
the
sin
into
which
she
had
let
herself
be
swept
.
Up
to
*NL*
that
moment
,
although
deeply
religious
,
she
had
never
thought
of
the
*NL*
greatness
of
her
crime
in
the
eyes
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
former
times
she
had
loved
God
passionately
in
the
Convent
of
*NL*
the
Sacred
Heart
;
in
the
present
circumstances
,
she
feared
him
with
*NL*
equal
intensity
.
The
struggles
which
lacerated
her
soul
were
all
the
*NL*
more
awful
in
that
her
fear
was
quite
irrational
.
Julien
found
that
*NL*
the
least
argument
irritated
instead
of
soothing
her
.
She
saw
in
the
*NL*
illness
the
language
of
hell
.
Moreover
,
Julien
was
himself
very
fond
of
*NL*
the
little
Stanislas
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
soon
assumed
a
serious
character
.
Then
incessant
remorse
deprived
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
of
even
her
power
of
sleep
.
She
ensconced
herself
in
a
*NL*
gloomy
silence
:
if
she
had
opened
her
mouth
,
it
would
only
have
been
to
*NL*
confess
her
crime
to
God
and
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
urge
you
,
''
said
Julien
to
her
,
as
soon
as
they
got
alone
,
``
not
to
*NL*
speak
to
anyone
.
Let
me
be
the
sole
confidant
of
your
sufferings
.
If
*NL*
you
still
love
me
,
do
not
speak
.
Your
words
will
not
be
able
to
take
*NL*
away
our
Stanislas
'
fever
.
''
But
his
consolations
produced
no
effect
.
*NL*
He
did
not
know
that
Madame
de
Renal
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
,
in
*NL*
order
to
appease
the
wrath
of
a
jealous
God
,
it
was
necessary
either
to
*NL*
hate
Julien
,
or
let
her
son
die
.
It
was
because
she
felt
she
could
not
*NL*
hate
her
lover
that
she
was
so
unhappy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fly
from
me
,
''
she
said
one
day
to
Julien
.
``
In
the
name
of
God
leave
*NL*
this
house
.
It
is
your
presence
here
which
kills
my
son
.
God
punishes
*NL*
me
,
''
she
added
in
a
low
voice
.
``
He
is
just
.
I
admire
his
fairness
.
*NL*
My
crime
is
awful
,
and
I
was
living
without
remorse
,
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
``
That
was
the
first
sign
of
my
desertion
of
God
:
I
ought
to
be
doubly
*NL*
punished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
profoundly
touched
.
He
could
see
in
this
neither
hypocrisy
*NL*
nor
exaggeration
.
``
She
thinks
that
she
is
killing
her
son
by
loving
me
,
*NL*
and
all
the
same
the
unhappy
woman
loves
me
more
than
her
son
.
I
can
not
*NL*
doubt
it
.
It
is
remorse
for
that
which
is
killing
her
.
Those
sentiments
*NL*
of
hers
have
real
greatness
.
But
how
could
I
have
inspired
such
a
love
,
*NL*
I
who
am
so
poor
,
so
badly-educated
,
so
ignorant
,
and
sometimes
so
*NL*
coarse
in
my
manners
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
the
child
was
extremely
ill
.
At
about
two
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
M.
de
Renal
came
to
see
it
.
The
child
consumed
by
fever
,
and
*NL*
extremely
flushed
,
could
not
recognise
its
father
.
Suddenly
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
threw
herself
at
her
husband
's
feet
;
Julien
saw
that
she
was
*NL*
going
to
confess
everything
and
ruin
herself
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
this
extraordinary
proceeding
annoyed
M.
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adieu
!
Adieu
!
''
he
said
,
going
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
listen
to
me
,
''
cried
his
wife
on
her
knees
before
him
,
trying
to
*NL*
hold
him
back
.
``
Hear
the
whole
truth
.
It
is
I
who
am
killing
my
son
.
I
*NL*
gave
him
life
,
and
I
am
taking
it
back
.
Heaven
is
punishing
me
.
In
the
*NL*
eyes
of
God
I
am
guilty
of
murder
.
It
is
necessary
that
I
should
ruin
*NL*
and
humiliate
myself
.
Perhaps
that
sacrifice
will
appease
the
the
Lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
M.
de
Renal
had
been
a
man
of
any
imagination
,
he
would
then
have
*NL*
realized
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Romantic
nonsense
,
''
he
cried
,
moving
his
wife
away
as
she
tried
to
*NL*
embrace
his
knees
.
``
All
that
is
romantic
nonsense
!
Julien
,
go
and
fetch
*NL*
the
doctor
at
daybreak
,
''
and
he
went
back
to
bed
.
Madame
de
Renal
fell
*NL*
on
her
knees
half-fainting
,
repelling
Julien
's
help
with
a
hysterical
*NL*
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
this
is
what
adultery
is
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Is
it
possible
*NL*
that
those
scoundrels
of
priests
should
be
right
,
that
they
who
commit
*NL*
so
many
sins
themselves
should
have
the
privilege
of
knowing
the
true
*NL*
theory
of
sin
?
How
droll
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
twenty
minutes
after
M.
de
Renal
had
gone
back
to
bed
,
Julien
saw
*NL*
the
woman
he
loved
with
her
head
resting
on
her
son
's
little
bed
,
*NL*
motionless
,
and
almost
unconscious
.
``
There
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
is
*NL*
a
woman
of
superior
temperament
brought
to
the
depths
of
unhappiness
*NL*
simply
because
she
has
known
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Time
moves
quickly
.
What
can
I
do
for
her
?
I
must
make
up
my
mind
.
I
*NL*
have
not
got
simply
myself
to
consider
now
.
What
do
I
care
for
men
and
*NL*
their
buffooneries
?
What
can
I
do
for
her
?
Leave
her
?
But
I
should
be
*NL*
leaving
her
alone
and
a
prey
to
the
most
awful
grief
.
That
automaton
*NL*
of
a
husband
is
more
harm
to
her
than
good
.
He
is
so
coarse
that
he
is
*NL*
bound
to
speak
harshly
to
her
.
She
may
go
mad
and
throw
herself
out
of
*NL*
the
window

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
leave
her

if
I
cease

she

everything

knows
,
in
spite
of
the
legacy
which
she
is
bound

bring

will
create

She

scoundrel

makes
the
illness

of
six
an
excuse
for
not
budging
from
this
house

and
not
without
a
*NL*
purpose
either
.
In
her
grief
and
her
fear
of
God
,
she
forgets
all
she
*NL*
knows
of
the
man
;
she
only
sees
the
priest

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away

Madame
de

suddenly
to
him
,
opening
her
eyes
.

I
would
give
my
life
a
thousand
times
to
know
what
could
be

use

answered
Julien
.
``
I
have
never
loved
you
so
much
,
my
dear
*NL*
angel
,
or
rather
it
is
only
from
this
last
moment
that
I
begin
to
adore
*NL*
you
as
you
deserve
to
be
adored

What
would
become
of
me
far
from
you

*NL*
and
with
the
consciousness
that
you
are
unhappy
owing
to
what
I
have

done

But
do
n't
let
my
suffering
come
into
the
matter

go

yes

But
if
I

if
I
cease

watch
over

to
be
*NL*
incessantly
between
you

you
will
tell
him
everything

*NL*
You
will
ruin
yourself

Remember
that
he
will
hound
you
out
of
his
*NL*
house
in
disgrace

Besancon
will
talk
of
the
scandal

You
will
be
said

to
be
absolutely
in
the
wrong

You
will
never
lift
up

again

after
that
shame

*NL*
``
That

what
I
ask

standing
up

I
shall
suffer

so
much

you

also
make

unhappy

throwing
myself
into

I
shall
save
my

Such
a
humiliation
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
all
is
perhaps
to
be
regarded
as
a
public
penitence

So
far
as

my
weak
judgment
goes

is
it
not
the
greatest
sacrifice
that
I
can
make

perhaps
He

deign

accept

Madame

up

At

Julien

melted
into
tears

falling
at

Finally
heaven

pity

this
unfortunate

Little
by

Stanislas
got
out

danger

But
the
ice
was
broken

Her
reason
had

realised

sin

She
could
not
recover
her
equilibrium

Her

remorse
remained

were
what

not
be
afraid
at
the
sight
of
hell
?
but
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
I
*NL*
do
not
repent
at
all
.
I
would
commit
my
sin
over
again
if
I
had
the
*NL*
opportunity
.
If
heaven
will
only
forbear
to
punish
me
in
this
world
and
*NL*
through
my
children
,
I
shall
have
more
than
I
deserve
.
But
you
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
,
my
Julien
,
''
she
would
cry
at
other
moments
,
``
are
you
happy
?
Do
*NL*
you
think
I
love
you
enough
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
suspiciousness
and
morbid
pride
of
Julien
,
who
needed
,
above
all
,
*NL*
a
self-sacrificing
love
,
altogether
vanished
when
he
saw
at
every
hour
*NL*
of
the
day
so
great
and
indisputable
a
sacrifice
.
He
adored
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
.
``
It
makes
no
difference
her
being
noble
,
and
my
being
a
*NL*
labourer
's
son
.
She
loves
me
...
she
does
not
regard
me
as
a
valet
*NL*
charged
with
the
functions
of
a
lover
.
''
That
fear
once
dismissed
,
*NL*
Julien
fell
into
all
the
madness
of
love
,
into
all
its
deadly
*NL*
uncertainties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
''
she
would
cry
,
seeing
his
doubts
of
her
love
,
``
let
me
*NL*
feel
quite
happy
during
the
three
days
we
still
have
together
.
Let
us
*NL*
make
haste
;
perhaps
to-morrow
will
be
too
late
.
If
heaven
strikes
me
*NL*
through
my
children
,
it
will
be
in
vain
that
I
shall
try
only
to
live
*NL*
to
love
you
,
and
to
be
blind
to
the
fact
that
it
is
my
crime
which
has
*NL*
killed
them
.
I
could
not
survive
that
blow
.
Even
if
I
wished
I
could
*NL*
not
;
I
should
go
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
if
only
I
could
take
your
sin
on
myself
as
you
so
generously
*NL*
offered
to
take
Stanislas
'
burning
fever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
great
moral
crisis
changed
the
character
of
the
sentiment
*NL*
which
united
Julien
and
his
mistress
.
His
love
was
no
longer
simply
*NL*
admiration
for
her
beauty
,
and
the
pride
of
possessing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henceforth
their
happiness
was
of
a
quite
superior
character
.
The
flame
*NL*
which
consumed
them
was
more
intense
.
They
had
transports
filled
with
*NL*
madness
.
Judged
by
the
worldly
standard
their
happiness
would
have
*NL*
appeared
intensified
.
But
they
no
longer
found
that
delicious
serenity
,
*NL*
that
cloudless
happiness
,
that
facile
joy
of
the
first
period
of
their
*NL*
love
,
when
Madame
de
Renal
's
only
fear
was
that
Julien
did
not
love
her
*NL*
enough
.
Their
happiness
had
at
times
the
complexion
of
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
happiest
and
apparently
their
most
tranquil
moments
,
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
would
suddenly
cry
out
,
``
Oh
,
great
God
,
I
see
hell
,
''
as
she
*NL*
pressed
Julien
's
hand
with
a
convulsive
grasp
.
``
What
horrible
tortures
!
*NL*
I
have
well
deserved
them
.
''
She
grasped
him
and
hung
on
to
him
like
ivy
*NL*
onto
a
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
would
try
in
vain
to
calm
that
agitated
soul
.
She
would
take
his
*NL*
hand
,
cover
it
with
kisses
.
Then
,
relapsing
into
a
gloomy
reverie
,
she
*NL*
would
say
,
``
Hell
itself
would
be
a
blessing
for
me
.
I
should
still
have
*NL*
some
days
to
pass
with
him
on
this
earth
,
but
hell
on
earth
,
the
death
*NL*
of
my
children
.
Still
,
perhaps
my
crime
will
be
forgiven
me
at
that
*NL*
price
.
Oh
,
great
God
,
do
not
grant
me
my
pardon
at
so
great
a
price
.
*NL*
These
poor
children
have
in
no
way
transgressed
against
You
.
I
,
I
am
*NL*
the
only
culprit
.
I
love
a
man
who
is
not
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
subsequently
saw
Madame
de
Renal
attain
what
were
apparently
*NL*
moments
of
tranquillity
.
She
was
endeavouring
to
control
herself
;
*NL*
she
did
not
wish
to
poison
the
life
of
the
man
she
loved
.
They
found
*NL*
the
days
pass
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
amid
these
alternating
*NL*
moods
of
love
,
remorse
,
and
voluptuousness
.
Julien
lost
the
habit
of
*NL*
reflecting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Elisa
went
to
attend
to
a
little
lawsuit
which
she
had
at
*NL*
Verrieres
.
She
found
Valenod
very
piqued
against
Julien
.
She
hated
the
*NL*
tutor
and
would
often
speak
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
ruin
me
,
Monsieur
,
if
I
tell
the
truth
,
''
she
said
one
day
to
*NL*
Valenod
.
``
All
masters
have
an
understanding
amongst
themselves
with
*NL*
regard
to
matters
of
importance
.
There
are
certain
disclosures
which
*NL*
poor
servants
are
never
forgiven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
these
stereotyped
phrases
,
which
his
curiosity
managed
to
cut
*NL*
short
,
Monsieur
Valenod
received
some
information
extremely
mortifying
*NL*
to
his
self-conceit
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
woman
,
who
was
the
most
distinguished
in
the
district
,
the
woman
*NL*
on
whom
he
had
lavished
so
much
attention
in
the
last
six
years
,
and
*NL*
made
no
secret
of
it
,
more
was
the
pity
,
this
woman
who
was
so
proud
,
*NL*
whose
disdain
had
put
him
to
the
blush
times
without
number
,
had
just
*NL*
taken
for
her
lover
a
little
workman
masquerading
as
a
tutor
.
And
to
*NL*
fill
the
cup
of
his
jealousy
,
Madame
de
Renal
adored
that
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
''
added
the
housemaid
with
a
sigh
,
``
Julien
did
not
put
himself
out
*NL*
at
all
to
make
his
conquest
,
his
manner
was
as
cold
as
ever
,
even
with
*NL*
Madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elisa
had
only
become
certain
in
the
country
,
but
she
believed
that
*NL*
this
intrigue
dated
from
much
further
back
.
``
That
is
no
doubt
the
*NL*
reason
,
''
she
added
spitefully
,
``
why
he
refused
to
marry
me
.
And
to
*NL*
think
what
a
fool
I
was
when
I
went
to
consult
Madame
de
Renal
and
*NL*
begged
her
to
speak
to
the
tutor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
same
evening
,
M.
de
Renal
received
from
the
town
,
together
*NL*
with
his
paper
,
a
long
anonymous
letter
which
apprised
him
in
the
*NL*
greatest
detail
of
what
was
taking
place
in
his
house
.
Julien
saw
him
*NL*
pale
as
he
read
this
letter
written
on
blue
paper
,
and
look
at
him
*NL*
with
a
malicious
expression
.
During
all
that
evening
the
mayor
failed
*NL*
to
throw
off
his
trouble
.
It
was
in
vain
that
Julien
paid
him
court
by
*NL*
asking
for
explanations
about
the
genealogy
of
the
best
families
in
*NL*
Burgundy
.

ANONYMOUS

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
left
the
drawing-room
about
midnight
,
Julien
had
time
to
say
to
*NL*
his
love
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
us
see
each
other
to-night
.
Your
husband
has
suspicions
.
I
*NL*
would
swear
that
that
big
letter
he
read
with
a
sigh
was
an
anonymous
*NL*
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
Julien
locked
himself
into
his
room
.
Madame
de
Renal
had
*NL*
the
mad
idea
that
this
warning
was
only
a
pretext
for
not
seeing
her
.
*NL*
She
absolutely
lost
her
head
,
and
came
to
his
door
at
the
accustomed
*NL*
hour
.
Julien
,
who
had
heard
the
noise
in
the
corridor
,
immediately
blew
*NL*
out
his
lamp
.
Someone
was
trying
to
open
the
door
.
Was
it
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
?
Was
it
a
jealous
husband
?
*NL*
*NL*
Very
early
next
morning
the
cook
,
who
liked
Julien
,
brought
him
a
book
,
*NL*
on
the
cover
of
which
he
read
these
words
written
in
Italian
:
_
Guardate
*NL*
alla
pagina
_
130
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
shuddered
at
the
imprudence
,
looked
for
page
130
,
and
found
*NL*
pinned
to
it
the
following
letter
hastily
written
,
bathed
with
tears
,
*NL*
and
full
of
spelling
mistakes
.
Madame
de
Renal
was
usually
very
*NL*
correct
.
He
was
touched
by
this
circumstance
,
and
somewhat
forgot
the
*NL*
awfulness
of
the
indiscretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
did
not
want
to
receive
me
to-night
?
There
are
*NL*
moments
when
I
think
that
I
have
never
read
down
to
the
*NL*
depths
of
your
soul
.
Your
looks
frighten
me
.
I
am
afraid
*NL*
of
you
.
Great
God
!
perhaps
you
have
never
loved
me
?
In
*NL*
that
case
let
my
husband
discover
my
love
,
and
shut
me
*NL*
up
in
a
prison
in
the
country
far
away
from
my
children
.
*NL*
Perhaps
God
wills
it
so
.
I
shall
die
soon
,
but
you
will
*NL*
have
proved
yourself
a
monster

*NL*
``
Do
you
not
love
me

Are
you
tired
of
my
fits
of
folly
*NL*

of
remorse

you
wicked
man
?
Do
you
wish
to
ruin
me
?
*NL*
I
will
show
you
an
easy
way
.
Go
and
show
this
letter
to
*NL*
all
Verrieres
,
or
rather
show
it
to
M.
Valenod
.
Tell
him
*NL*
that
I
love
you
,
nay
,
do
not
utter
such
a
blasphemy
,
*NL*
tell
him
I
adore
you
,
that
it
was
only
on
the
day
I
saw
*NL*
you
that
my
life
commenced
;
that
even
in
the
maddest
*NL*
moments
of
my
youth
I
never
even
dreamt
of
the
happiness
*NL*
that
I
owe
to
you
,
that
I
have
sacrificed
my
life
to
*NL*
you
and
that
I
am
sacrificing
my
soul

You
know
that
*NL*
I
am
sacrificing
much
more
.
But
does
that
man
know
*NL*
the
meaning
of
sacrifice
?
Tell
him
,
I
say
,
simply
to
*NL*
irritate
him
,
that
I
will
defy
all
evil
tongues
,
that
*NL*
the
only
misfortune
for
me
in
the
whole
world
would
*NL*
be
to
witness
any
change
in
the
only
man
who
holds
me
*NL*
to
life

What
a
happiness
it
would
be
to
me
to
lose
*NL*
my
life
,
to
offer
it
up
as
a
sacrifice
and
to
have
no
*NL*
longer
any
fear
for
my
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
no
doubt
about
it
,
dear
one
,
if
it
is
an
*NL*
anonymous
letter

it
comes
from
that
odious
being
who
*NL*
has
persecuted
me
for
the
last
six
years
with
his
loud
*NL*
voice
,
his
stories
about
his
jumps
on
horseback
,
his
*NL*
fatuity

the
never
ending
catalogue

all
his

advantages

Is
there

anonymous

should
like
to
discuss

that
question

you

you
wicked

no

you
*NL*
acted
rightly

Clasping
you
in
my
arms
perhaps
for
the
*NL*
last
time

I
should
never
have
been
able
to
argue
as

coldly
as
I
do

From

our
happiness

easy

vexation

Yes

on
those
days

you
have

*NL*
received
some
amusing
book
from
M.
Fouque

The
sacrifice

is
made

to-morrow

whether
there
is
or
whether
there
is
*NL*
not
any
anonymous
letter

myself
will
tell
my
husband

I
have
received
an
anonymous
letter

that
it
is
*NL*
necessary
to
give
you
a
golden
bridge
at
once

find
some
*NL*
honourable
excuse

send
you
back
to
your
parents

delay

Alas

one

fortnight

a
month

Go

I
will
do
you
justice
,
*NL*
you
will
suffer
as
much
as
I
,
but
anyway

this
is
the
*NL*
only
means
of
disposing
of
this
anonymous
letter

It
is
*NL*
not
the
first
that
my
husband
has
received
,

on
my
*NL*
score
too

Alas

how
I
used
to
laugh
over
them

My
one
aim
is
to
make
my
husband
think

the
letter
*NL*
comes
from
M.
Valenod

I
have
no
doubt
that
he
is
*NL*
its
author

If
you
leave
the
house
,
make
a
point
of
*NL*
establishing
yourself
at
Verrieres
;
I
will
manage
that
*NL*
my
husband
should
think
of
passing
a
fortnight
there
*NL*
in
order
to
prove
to
the
fools
there
was
no
coldness
*NL*
between
him
and
me

Once
at
Verrieres

establish
ties
of
*NL*
friendship
with
everyone

even
with
the
Liberals

I
am
*NL*
sure

all
their
ladies

seek
you
out

one
day

Try
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
*NL*
ingratiate
yourself
with
him

The
essential
point
is
*NL*
that
it
should
be
notorious
in
Verrieres
that
you
are
*NL*
going
to
enter
the
household

it

well

all

I

wandering

Anyway
you

your
line

conduct

nice

way
disdainful

coarse

so
far

conform

lays
down

*NL*
*NL*
All
your
little
goings-on
are
known
,
but
the
persons
*NL*
interested
in
stopping
have
been
warned
.
I
have
still
*NL*
sufficient
friendship
left
for
you
to
urge
you
to
cease
*NL*
all
relations
with
the
little
peasant
.
If
you
are
*NL*
sensible
enough
to
do
this
,
your
husband
will
believe
*NL*
that
the
notification
he
has
received
is
misleading
,
and
*NL*
he
will
be
left
in
his
illusion
.
Remember
that
I
have
*NL*
your
secret
;
tremble
,
unhappy
woman
,
you
must
now
_
walk
*NL*
straight

before
me

As

recognised

As
a
matter
of
fact
I
shall
be
very
much
*NL*
troubled
.
Great
God
!
What
a
risk
I
run
,
and
all
because
*NL*
you
thought
you
guessed
an
anonymous
letter
.
Finally
,
*NL*
looking
very
much
upset
,
I
shall
give
this
letter
to
my
*NL*
husband
and
say
that
an
unknown
man
handed
it
to
me
.
As
*NL*
for
you
,
go
for
a
walk
with
the
children
,
on
the
road
to
*NL*
the
great
woods

do
not
come
back
before
dinner-time

Ungrateful

out
some

Whatever
happens
,
be
certain
of
one
thing

I

never

our
final
separation
by
a

Oh
,
you
bad
mother

but
what
is
the
use
of
my
writing
*NL*
those
two
words
,
dear
Julien

I
do
not
feel
them
,
at
*NL*
this
moment
I
can
only
think
of
you

I
have
only
written
*NL*
them
so
as
not
to
be
blamed
by
you

what
is
the
good
*NL*
of
deception
now
that
I
find
myself
face

losing
you

Yes

let
my
soul
seem
monstrous

you

do
not
let
me
lie
to
the
man

I
have

already
deceived
only
too
much
in

mine

Go

*NL*
I
forgive
you
if
you
love
me
no
more

I
have
not
the
*NL*
time
to
read
over
my
letter

It
is
a
small
thing
in
my

eyes
to
pay
for
the
happy
days
that
I
have
just
passed
*NL*
in

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
DIALOGUE
WITH
A
MASTER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
,
our
frailty
is
the
cause
,
not
we
;
*NL*
For
such
as
we
are
made
of
,
such
we
be
.
--
_
Twelfth
Night
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
a
childish
pleasure
that
for
a
whole
hour
Julien
put
the
*NL*
words
together
.
As
he
came
out
of
his
room
,
he
met
his
pupils
with
*NL*
their
mother
.
She
took
the
letter
with
a
simplicity
and
a
courage
whose
*NL*
calmness
terrified
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
mouth-glue
dry
enough
yet
?
''
she
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
this
the
woman
who
was
so
maddened
by
remorse
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
``
What
are
her
plans
at
this
moment
?
''
He
was
too
proud
to
ask
her
,
but
*NL*
she
had
never
perhaps
pleased
him
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
turns
out
badly
,
''
she
added
with
the
same
coolness
,
``
I
shall
*NL*
be
deprived
of
everything
.
Take
charge
of
this
,
and
bury
it
in
some
*NL*
place
of
the
mountain
.
It
will
perhaps
one
day
be
my
only
resource
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
him
a
glass
case
in
red
morocco
filled
with
gold
and
some
*NL*
diamonds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
go
,
''
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
kissed
the
children
,
embracing
the
youngest
twice
.
Julien
remained
*NL*
motionless
.
She
left
him
at
a
rapid
pace
without
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
that
M.
de
Renal
had
opened
the
anonymous
letter
his
*NL*
life
had
been
awful
.
He
had
not
been
so
agitated
since
a
duel
which
he
*NL*
had
just
missed
having
in
1816
,
and
to
do
him
justice
,
the
prospect
of
*NL*
receiving
a
bullet
would
have
made
him
less
unhappy
.
He
scrutinised
the
*NL*
letter
from
every
standpoint
.
``
Is
that
not
a
woman
's
handwriting
?
''
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
.
In
that
case
,
what
woman
had
written
it
?
He
reviewed
*NL*
all
those
whom
he
knew
at
Verrieres
without
being
able
to
fix
his
*NL*
suspicions
on
any
one
.
Could
a
man
have
dictated
that
letter
?
Who
*NL*
was
that
man
?
Equal
uncertainty
on
this
point
.
The
majority
of
his
*NL*
acquaintances
were
jealous
of
him
,
and
,
no
doubt
,
hated
him
.
``
I
must
*NL*
consult
my
wife
,
''
he
said
to
himself
through
habit
,
as
he
got
up
from
*NL*
the
arm-chair
in
which
he
had
collapsed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
God
!
''
he
said
aloud
before
he
got
up
,
striking
his
head
,
``
it
is
*NL*
she
above
all
of
whom
I
must
be
distrustful
.
At
the
present
moment
she
*NL*
is
my
enemy
,
''
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
through
sheer
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
a
poetic
justice
for
that
hardness
of
heart
which
constitutes
the
*NL*
provincial
idea
of
shrewdness
,
the
two
men
whom
M.
de
Renal
feared
the
*NL*
most
at
the
present
moment
were
his
two
most
intimate
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
ten
friends
perhaps
after
those
,
''
and
he
passed
them
in
review
,
*NL*
gauging
the
degree
of
consolation
which
he
could
get
from
each
one
.
*NL*
``
All
of
them
,
all
of
them
,
''
he
exclaimed
in
a
rage
,
``
will
derive
the
*NL*
most
supreme
pleasure
from
my
awful
experience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
luck
would
have
it
,
he
thought
himself
envied
,
and
not
without
*NL*
reason
.
Apart
from
his
superb
town
mansion
in
which
the
king
of
--
*NL*
had
recently
spent
the
night
,
and
thus
conferred
on
it
an
enduring
*NL*
honour
,
he
had
decorated
his
chateau
at
Vergy
extremely
well
.
The
*NL*
facade
was
painted
white
and
the
windows
adorned
with
fine
green
*NL*
shutters
.
He
was
consoled
for
a
moment
by
the
thought
of
this
*NL*
magnificence
.
The
fact
was
that
this
chateau
was
seen
from
three
or
*NL*
four
leagues
off
,
to
the
great
prejudice
of
all
the
country
houses
or
*NL*
so-called
chateaux
of
the
neighbourhood
,
which
had
been
left
in
the
*NL*
humble
grey
colour
given
them
by
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
of
his
friends
on
whose
pity
and
whose
tears
M.
de
Renal
*NL*
could
count
,
the
churchwarden
of
the
parish
;
but
he
was
an
idiot
who
*NL*
cried
at
everything
.
This
man
,
however
,
was
his
only
resource
.
``
What
*NL*
unhappiness
is
comparable
to
mine
,
''
he
exclaimed
with
rage
.
``
What
*NL*
isolation
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
?
''
said
this
truly
pitiable
man
to
himself
.
``
Is
it
*NL*
possible
that
I
have
no
friend
in
my
misfortune
of
whom
I
can
ask
*NL*
advice
?
for
my
mind
is
wandering
,
I
feel
it
.
Oh
,
Falcoz
!
oh
,
Ducros
!
''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
with
bitterness
.
Those
were
the
names
of
two
friends
of
*NL*
his
childhood
whom
he
had
dropped
owing
to
his
snobbery
in
1814
.
They
*NL*
were
not
noble
,
and
he
had
wished
to
change
the
footing
of
equality
on
*NL*
which
they
had
been
living
with
him
since
their
childhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
,
Falcoz
,
a
paper-merchant
of
Verrieres
,
and
a
man
of
*NL*
intellect
and
spirit
,
had
bought
a
printing
press
in
the
chief
town
of
*NL*
the
department
and
undertaken
the
production
of
a
journal
.
The
priestly
*NL*
congregation
had
resolved
to
ruin
him
;
his
journal
had
been
condemned
,
*NL*
and
he
had
been
deprived
of
his
printer
's
diploma
.
In
these
sad
*NL*
circumstances
he
ventured
to
write
to
M.
de
Renal
for
the
first
time
*NL*
for
ten
years
.
The
mayor
of
Verrieres
thought
it
his
duty
to
answer
*NL*
in
the
old
Roman
style
:
``
If
the
King
's
Minister
were
to
do
me
the
*NL*
honour
of
consulting
me
,
I
should
say
to
him
,
ruin
ruthlessly
all
the
*NL*
provincial
printers
,
and
make
printing
a
monopoly
like
tobacco
.
''
M.
de
*NL*
Renal
was
horrified
to
remember
the
terms
of
this
letter
to
an
intimate
*NL*
friend
whom
all
Verrieres
had
once
admired
,
``
Who
would
have
said
that
*NL*
I
,
with
my
rank
,
my
fortune
,
my
decorations
,
would
ever
come
to
regret
*NL*
it
?
''
It
was
in
these
transports
of
rage
,
directed
now
against
himself
,
*NL*
now
against
all
his
surroundings
,
that
he
passed
an
awful
night
;
but
,
*NL*
fortunately
,
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
spy
on
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
accustomed
to
Louise
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
she
knows
all
my
*NL*
affairs
.
If
I
were
free
to
marry
to-morrow
,
I
should
not
find
anyone
to
*NL*
take
her
place
.
''
Then
he
began
to
plume
himself
on
the
idea
that
his
*NL*
wife
was
innocent
.
This
point
of
view
did
not
require
any
manifestation
*NL*
of
character
,
and
suited
him
much
better
.
``
How
many
calumniated
women
*NL*
has
one
not
seen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
he
suddenly
exclaimed
,
as
he
walked
about
feverishly
,
``
shall
I
*NL*
put
up
with
her
making
a
fool
of
me
with
her
lover
as
though
I
were
*NL*
a
man
of
no
account
,
some
mere
ragamuffin
?
Is
all
Verrieres
to
make
*NL*
merry
over
my
complaisance
?
What
have
they
not
said
about
Charmier
*NL*
-LRB-
he
was
a
husband
in
the
district
who
was
notoriously
deceived
-RRB-
?
Was
*NL*
there
not
a
smile
on
every
lip
at
the
mention
of
his
name
?
He
is
a
good
*NL*
advocate
,
but
whoever
said
anything
about
his
talent
for
speaking
?
`
Oh
,
*NL*
Charmier
,
'
they
say
,
`
Bernard
's
Charmier
,
'
he
is
thus
designated
by
the
*NL*
name
of
the
man
who
disgraces
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
daughter
,
thank
heaven
,
''
M.
de
Renal
would
say
at
other
*NL*
times
,
``
and
the
way
in
which
I
am
going
to
punish
the
mother
will
*NL*
consequently
not
be
so
harmful
to
my
children
's
household
.
I
could
*NL*
surprise
this
little
peasant
with
my
wife
and
kill
them
both
;
in
that
*NL*
case
the
tragedy
of
the
situation
would
perhaps
do
away
with
the
*NL*
grotesque
element
.
''
This
idea
appealed
to
him
.
He
followed
it
up
in
all
*NL*
its
details
.
``
The
penal
code
is
on
my
side
,
and
whatever
happens
our
*NL*
congregation
and
my
friends
on
the
jury
will
save
me
.
''
He
examined
his
*NL*
hunting-knife
which
was
quite
sharp
,
but
the
idea
of
blood
frightened
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
thrash
this
insolent
tutor
within
an
inch
of
his
life
and
*NL*
hound
him
out
of
the
house
;
but
what
a
sensation
that
would
make
in
*NL*
Verrieres
and
even
over
the
whole
department
!
After
Falcoz
'
journal
had
*NL*
been
condemned
,
and
when
its
chief
editor
left
prison
,
I
had
a
hand
*NL*
in
making
him
lose
his
place
of
six
hundred
francs
a
year
.
They
say
*NL*
that
this
scribbler
has
dared
to
show
himself
again
in
Besancon
.
He
*NL*
may
lampoon
me
adroitly
and
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
be
impossible
*NL*
to
bring
him
up
before
the
courts
.
Bring
him
up
before
the
courts
!
*NL*
The
insolent
wretch
will
insinuate
in
a
thousand
and
one
ways
that
he
*NL*
has
spoken
the
truth
.
A
well-born
man
who
keeps
his
place
like
I
do
,
*NL*
is
hated
by
all
the
plebeians
.
I
shall
see
my
name
in
all
those
awful
*NL*
Paris
papers
.
Oh
,
my
God
,
what
depths
.
To
see
the
ancient
name
of
*NL*
Renal
plunged
in
the
mire
of
ridicule
.
If
I
ever
travel
I
shall
have
*NL*
to
change
my
name
.
What
!
abandon
that
name
which
is
my
glory
and
my
*NL*
strength
.
Could
anything
be
worse
than
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
do
not
kill
my
wife
but
turn
her
out
in
disgrace
,
she
has
her
*NL*
aunt
in
Besancon
who
is
going
to
hand
all
her
fortune
over
to
her
.
*NL*
My
wife
will
go
and
live
in
Paris
with
Julien
.
It
will
be
known
at
*NL*
Verrieres
,
and
I
shall
be
taken
for
a
dupe
.
''
The
unhappy
man
then
*NL*
noticed
from
the
paleness
of
the
lamplight
that
the
dawn
was
beginning
*NL*
to
appear
.
He
went
to
get
a
little
fresh
air
in
the
garden
.
At
this
*NL*
moment
he
had
almost
determined
to
make
no
scandal
,
particularly
in
*NL*
view
of
the
fact
that
a
scandal
would
overwhelm
with
joy
all
his
good
*NL*
friends
in
Verrieres
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
promenade
in
the
garden
calmed
him
a
little
.
``
No
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
deprive
myself
of
my
wife
,
she
is
too
useful
to
me
.
''
He
*NL*
imagined
with
horror
what
his
house
would
be
without
his
wife
.
The
only
*NL*
relative
he
had
was
the
Marquise
of
R
--
old
,
stupid
,
and
malicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
sensible
idea
occurred
to
him
,
but
its
execution
required
a
*NL*
strength
of
character
considerably
superior
to
the
small
amount
of
*NL*
character
which
the
poor
man
possessed
.
``
If
I
keep
my
wife
,
''
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
,
``
I
know
what
I
shall
do
one
day
;
on
some
occasion
when
*NL*
she
makes
me
lose
patience
,
I
shall
reproach
her
with
her
guilt
.
She
*NL*
is
proud
,
we
shall
quarrel
,
and
all
this
will
happen
before
she
has
*NL*
inherited
her
aunt
's
fortune
.
And
how
they
will
all
make
fun
of
me
*NL*
then
!
My
wife
loves
her
children
,
the
result
will
be
that
everything
*NL*
will
go
to
them
.
But
as
for
me
,
I
shall
be
the
laughing-stock
of
*NL*
Verrieres
.
`
What
,
'
they
will
say
,
`
he
could
not
even
manage
to
revenge
*NL*
himself
on
his
wife
!
'
Would
it
not
be
better
to
leave
it
and
verify
*NL*
nothing
?
In
that
case
I
tie
my
hands
,
and
can
not
afterwards
reproach
*NL*
her
with
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
afterwards
M.
de
Renal
,
once
more
a
prey
to
wounded
vanity
,
*NL*
set
himself
laboriously
to
recollect
all
the
methods
of
procedure
*NL*
mentioned
in
the
billiard-room
of
the
_
Casino
_
or
the
_
Nobles
'
Club
_
in
*NL*
Verrieres
,
when
some
fine
talker
interrupted
the
pool
to
divert
himself
*NL*
at
the
expense
of
some
deceived
husband
.
How
cruel
these
pleasantries
*NL*
appeared
to
him
at
the
present
moment
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
,
why
is
my
wife
not
dead
!
then
I
should
be
impregnable
against
*NL*
ridicule
.
Why
am
I
not
a
widower
?
I
should
go
and
pass
six
months
in
*NL*
Paris
in
the
best
society
.
After
this
moment
of
happiness
occasioned
*NL*
by
the
idea
of
widowerhood
,
his
imagination
reverted
to
the
means
of
*NL*
assuring
himself
of
the
truth
.
Should
he
put
a
slight
layer
of
bran
*NL*
before
the
door
of
Julien
's
room
at
midnight
after
everyone
had
gone
to
*NL*
bed
?
He
would
see
the
impression
of
the
feet
in
the
following
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
no
good
,
''
he
suddenly
exclaimed
with
rage
.
``
That
*NL*
inquisitive
Elisa
will
notice
it
,
and
they
will
soon
know
all
over
the
*NL*
house
that
I
am
jealous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
_
Casino
_
tale
a
husband
had
assured
himself
of
his
*NL*
misfortune
by
tying
a
hair
with
a
little
wax
so
that
it
shut
the
door
*NL*
of
the
gallant
as
effectually
as
a
seal
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
so
many
hours
of
uncertainty
this
means
of
clearing
up
his
fate
*NL*
seemed
to
him
emphatically
the
best
,
and
he
was
thinking
of
availing
*NL*
himself
of
it
when
,
in
one
of
the
turnings
of
the
avenue
he
met
the
*NL*
very
woman
whom
he
would
like
to
have
seen
dead
.
She
was
coming
back
*NL*
from
the
village
.
She
had
gone
to
hear
mass
in
the
church
of
Vergy
.
*NL*
A
tradition
,
extremely
doubtful
in
the
eyes
of
the
cold
philosopher
,
*NL*
but
in
which
she
believed
,
alleges
that
the
little
church
was
once
the
*NL*
chapel
of
the
chateau
of
the
Lord
of
Vergy
.
This
idea
obsessed
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
all
the
time
in
the
church
that
she
had
counted
on
spending
in
*NL*
prayer
.
She
kept
on
imagining
to
herself
the
spectacle
of
her
husband
*NL*
killing
Julien
when
out
hunting
as
though
by
accident
,
and
then
making
*NL*
her
eat
his
heart
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
fate
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
depends
on
what
he
will
think
when
*NL*
he
listens
to
me
.
It
may
be
I
shall
never
get
another
opportunity
*NL*
of
speaking
to
him
after
this
fatal
quarter
of
an
hour
.
He
is
not
a
*NL*
reasonable
person
who
is
governed
by
his
intellect
.
In
that
case
,
with
*NL*
the
help
of
my
weak
intelligence
,
I
could
anticipate
what
he
will
do
or
*NL*
say
.
He
will
decide
our
common
fate
.
He
has
the
power
.
But
this
fate
*NL*
depends
on
my
adroitness
,
on
my
skill
in
directing
the
ideas
of
this
*NL*
crank
,
who
is
blinded
by
his
rage
and
unable
to
see
half
of
what
takes
*NL*
place
.
Great
God
!
I
need
talent
and
coolness
,
where
shall
I
get
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
regained
her
calmness
as
though
by
magic
,
and
she
entered
the
*NL*
garden
and
saw
her
husband
in
the
distance
.
His
dishevelled
hair
and
*NL*
disordered
dress
showed
that
he
had
not
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
him
a
letter
with
a
broken
seal
but
folded
.
As
for
him
,
*NL*
without
opening
it
,
he
gazed
at
his
wife
with
the
eyes
of
a
madman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
an
abominable
thing
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
``
which
an
evil-looking
*NL*
man
who
makes
out
that
he
knows
you
and
is
under
an
obligation
to
you
,
*NL*
handed
to
me
as
I
was
passing
behind
the
notary
's
garden
.
I
insist
on
*NL*
one
thing
and
that
is
that
you
send
back
this
M.
Julien
to
his
parents
*NL*
and
without
delay
.
''
Madame
de
Renal
hastened
to
say
these
words
,
*NL*
perhaps
a
little
before
the
psychological
moment
,
in
order
to
free
*NL*
herself
from
the
awful
prospect
of
having
to
say
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
seized
with
joy
on
seeing
that
which
she
was
occasioning
to
her
*NL*
husband
.
She
realised
from
the
fixed
stare
which
he
was
rivetting
on
*NL*
her
that
Julien
had
surmised
rightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
genius
he
is
to
be
so
brilliantly
diplomatic
instead
of
*NL*
succumbing
to
so
real
a
misfortune
,
''
she
thought
.
``
He
will
go
very
far
*NL*
in
the
future
!
Alas
,
his
successes
will
only
make
him
forget
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
act
of
admiration
for
the
man
whom
she
adored
quite
cured
*NL*
her
of
her
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
congratulated
herself
on
her
tactics
.
``
I
have
not
been
unworthy
of
*NL*
Julien
,
''
she
said
to
herself
with
a
sweet
and
secret
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
kept
examining
the
second
anonymous
letter
which
the
*NL*
reader
may
remember
was
composed
of
printed
words
glued
on
to
a
paper
*NL*
verging
on
blue
.
He
did
not
say
a
word
for
fear
of
giving
himself
away
.
*NL*
``
They
still
make
fun
of
me
in
every
possible
way
,
''
said
M.
de
Renal
*NL*
to
himself
,
overwhelmed
with
exhaustion
.
``
Still
more
new
insults
to
*NL*
examine
and
all
the
time
on
account
of
my
wife
.
''
He
was
on
the
point
*NL*
of
heaping
on
her
the
coarsest
insults
.
He
was
barely
checked
by
the
*NL*
prospects
of
the
Besancon
legacy
.
Consumed
by
the
need
of
venting
his
*NL*
feelings
on
something
,
he
crumpled
up
the
paper
of
the
second
anonymous
*NL*
letter
and
began
to
walk
about
with
huge
strides
.
He
needed
to
get
*NL*
away
from
his
wife
.
A
few
moments
afterwards
he
came
back
to
her
in
a
*NL*
quieter
frame
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
thing
is
to
take
some
definite
line
and
send
Julien
away
,
''
she
*NL*
said
immediately
,
``
after
all
it
is
only
a
labourer
's
son
.
You
will
*NL*
compensate
him
by
a
few
crowns
and
besides
he
is
clever
and
will
easily
*NL*
manage
to
find
a
place
,
with
M.
Valenod
for
example
,
or
with
the
*NL*
sub-prefect
De
Maugiron
who
both
have
children
.
In
that
way
you
will
*NL*
not
be
doing
him
any
wrong
...
''
``
There
you
go
talking
like
the
fool
*NL*
that
you
are
,
''
exclaimed
M.
de
Renal
in
a
terrible
voice
.
``
How
can
one
*NL*
hope
that
a
woman
will
show
any
good
sense
?
You
never
bother
yourself
*NL*
about
common
sense
.
How
can
you
ever
get
to
know
anything
?
Your
*NL*
indifference
and
your
idleness
give
you
no
energy
except
for
hunting
*NL*
those
miserable
butterflies
,
which
we
are
unfortunate
to
have
in
our
*NL*
houses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
let
him
speak
and
he
spoke
for
a
long
time
.
_
He
was
*NL*
working
off
his
anger
_
,
to
use
the
local
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
she
answered
him
at
last
,
``
I
speak
as
a
woman
who
has
*NL*
been
outraged
in
her
honour
,
that
is
to
say
,
in
what
she
holds
most
*NL*
precious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
preserved
an
unalterable
sang-froid
during
all
this
*NL*
painful
conversation
on
the
result
of
which
depended
the
possibility
of
*NL*
still
living
under
the
same
roof
as
Julien
.
She
sought
for
the
ideas
*NL*
which
she
thought
most
adapted
to
guide
her
husband
's
blind
anger
*NL*
into
a
safe
channel
.
She
had
been
insensible
to
all
the
insulting
*NL*
imputations
which
he
had
addressed
to
her
.
She
was
not
listening
to
*NL*
them
,
she
was
then
thinking
about
Julien
.
``
Will
he
be
pleased
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
little
peasant
whom
we
have
loaded
with
attentions
,
and
even
with
*NL*
presents
,
may
be
innocent

she
said
to
him
at
last
,
``
but
he
is
none
*NL*
the
less
the
occasion
of
the
first
affront
that
I
have
ever
received
.
*NL*
Monsieur
,
when
I
read
this
abominable
paper
,
I
vowed
to
myself
that
*NL*
either
he
or
I
should
leave
your
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
make
a
scandal
so
as
to
dishonour
me
and
yourself
as
*NL*
well
?
You
will
make
things
hum
in
Verrieres
I
can
assure
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true

the
degree

has
succeeded
in
placing
you

your
family
and
the
town
is
the
*NL*
subject
of
general
envy

Well
,
I
will
urge
Julien
to
ask
you
for
*NL*
a
holiday
to
go
and
spend
the
month
with
that
wood-merchant
of
the
*NL*
mountains
,
a
fit
friend
to
be
sure
for
this
little
labourer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
you
do
nothing
at
all

resumed
M.
de
Renal
with
a
fair
amount
of
*NL*
tranquillity
.
``
I
particularly
insist
on
your
not
speaking
to

You
*NL*
will
put
him
into
a
temper

him
quarrel
with

always
spoiling
for
a
quarrel

``
That

no

resumed
Madame
de
Renal
.
``
He
may
be
*NL*
learned

you
know
all
about
that

at
bottom
he
is
only
a
peasant

*NL*
For
my
own
part
I
never
thought
much
of
him
since
he
refused
to
*NL*
marry
Elisa
.
It
was
an
assured
fortune
;
and
that
on
the
pretext
that
*NL*
sometimes
she
had
made
secret
visits
to
M.
Valenod

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
M.
de

lifting
up
his
eyebrows
inordinately

``
What

did
Julien
tell
you
that
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
exactly
,
he
always
talked
of
the
vocation

holy
ministry

believe
me
,
the
first
vocation
for
those
lower-class
*NL*
people
is
getting
their
bread
and
butter

He
gave
me
to
understand
that

he
was
quite
aware
of
her
secret
visits

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I

I
was
ignorant

exclaimed
M.
de
Renal
,
growing
as
angry
as
*NL*
before
and
accentuating
his
words
.
``
Things

Madame

with
a
smile

perhaps
no

would
not
have
minded
their
thinking
at

perfectly
platonic

growing
up

furiously

striking

discovery

himself
up

quarrel
,
I
can
take
those
foundlings
away
from
him
,
*NL*
but
,
''
he
continued
furiously
,
``
I
want
those
letters
at
once
.
Where
are
*NL*
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
drawer
in
my
secretary
,
but
I
shall
certainly
not
give
you
the
*NL*
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
manage
to
break
it
,
''
he
cried
,
running
towards
his
wife
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
break
in
fact
with
a
bar
of
iron
a
costly
secretary
of
veined
*NL*
mahogany
which
came
from
Paris
and
which
he
had
often
been
accustomed
*NL*
to
wipe
with
the
nap
of
his
coat
,
when
he
thought
he
had
detected
a
*NL*
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
had
climbed
up
at
a
run
the
hundred
and
twenty
steps
*NL*
of
the
dovecot
.
She
tied
the
corner
of
a
white
handkerchief
to
one
of
*NL*
the
bars
of
iron
of
the
little
window
.
She
was
the
happiest
of
women
.
*NL*
With
tears
in
her
eyes
she
looked
towards
the
great
mountain
forest
.
*NL*
``
Doubtless
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
Julien
is
watching
for
this
happy
*NL*
signal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
listened
attentively
for
a
long
time
and
then
she
cursed
the
*NL*
monotonous
noise
of
the
grasshopper
and
the
song
of
the
birds
.
``
Had
it
*NL*
not
been
for
that
importunate
noise
,
a
cry
of
joy
starting
from
the
big
*NL*
rocks
could
have
arrived
here
.
''
Her
greedy
eye
devoured
that
immense
*NL*
slope
of
dark
verdure
which
was
as
level
as
a
meadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
n't
he
clever
enough
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
quite
overcome
,
``
to
*NL*
invent
some
signal
to
tell
me
that
his
happiness
is
equal
to
mine
?
''
She
*NL*
only
came
down
from
the
dovecot
when
she
was
frightened
of
her
husband
*NL*
coming
there
to
look
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
him
furious
.
He
was
perusing
the
soothing
phrases
of
M.
de
*NL*
Valenod
and
reading
them
with
an
emotion
to
which
they
were
but
little
*NL*
used
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
come
back
to
the
same
idea
,
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
seizing
*NL*
a
moment
when
a
pause
in
her
husband
's
ejaculations
gave
her
the
*NL*
possibility
of
getting
heard
.
``
It
is
necessary
for
Julien
to
travel
.
*NL*
Whatever
talent
he
may
have
for
Latin
,
he
is
only
a
peasant
after
all
,
*NL*
often
coarse
and
lacking
in
tact
.
Thinking
to
be
polite
,
he
addresses
*NL*
inflated
compliments
to
me
every
day
,
which
are
in
bad
taste
.
He
learns
*NL*
them
by
heart
out
of
some
novel
or
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
reads
one
,
''
exclaimed
M.
de
Renal
.
``
I
am
assured
of
it
.
Do
*NL*
you
think
that
I
am
the
master
of
a
house
who
is
so
blind
as
to
be
*NL*
ignorant
of
what
takes
place
in
his
own
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
he
does
n't
read
these
droll
compliments
anywhere
,
he
invents
*NL*
them
,
and
that
's
all
the
worse
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
.
He
must
have
*NL*
talked
about
me
in
this
tone
in
Verrieres
and
perhaps
without
going
so
*NL*
far
,
''
said
Madame
Renal
with
the
idea
of
making
a
discovery
,
``
he
may
*NL*
have
talked
in
the
same
strain
to
Elisa
,
which
is
almost
the
same
as
if
*NL*
he
had
said
it
to
M.
Valenod
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
exclaimed
M.
de
Renal
,
shaking
the
table
and
the
room
with
one
of
*NL*
the
most
violent
raps
ever
made
by
a
human
fist
.
``
The
anonymous
printed
*NL*
letter
and
Valenod
's
letters
are
written
on
the
same
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
,
''
thought
Madame
de
Renal
.
She
pretended
to
be
overwhelmed
*NL*
at
this
discovery
,
and
without
having
the
courage
to
add
a
single
*NL*
word
,
went
and
sat
down
some
way
off
on
the
divan
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
point
the
battle
was
won
.
She
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
*NL*
preventing
M.
de
Renal
from
going
to
speak
to
the
supposed
author
of
*NL*
the
anonymous
letter
.
``
What
,
ca
n't
you
see
that
making
a
scene
with
M.
*NL*
Valenod
without
sufficient
proof
would
be
the
most
signal
mistake
?
You
*NL*
are
envied
,
Monsieur
,
and
who
is
responsible
?
Your
talents
:
your
wise
*NL*
management
,
your
tasteful
buildings
,
the
dowry
which
I
have
brought
*NL*
you
,
and
above
all
,
the
substantial
legacy
which
we
are
entitled
to
*NL*
hope
for
from
my
good
aunt
,
a
legacy
,
the
importance
of
which
is
*NL*
inordinately
exaggerated
,
have
made
you
into
the
first
person
in
*NL*
Verrieres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
forgetting
my
birth
,
''
said
M.
de
Renal
,
smiling
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
one
of
the
most
distinguished
gentlemen
in
the
province
,
''
*NL*
replied
Madame
de
Renal
emphatically
.
``
If
the
king
were
free
and
could
*NL*
give
birth
its
proper
due
,
you
would
no
doubt
figure
in
the
Chamber
of
*NL*
Peers
,
etc.
.
And
being
in
this
magnificent
position
,
you
yet
wish
to
*NL*
give
the
envious
a
fact
to
take
hold
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
speak
about
this
anonymous
letter
to
M.
Valenod
is
equivalent
*NL*
to
proclaiming
over
the
whole
of
Verrieres
,
nay
,
over
the
whole
of
*NL*
Besancon
,
over
the
whole
province
that
this
little
bourgeois
who
has
*NL*
been
admitted
perhaps
imprudently
to
intimacy
_
with
a
Renal
_
,
has
*NL*
managed
to
offend
him
.
At
the
time
when
those
letters
which
you
have
*NL*
just
taken
prove
that
I
have
reciprocated
M.
Valenod
's
love
,
you
ought
*NL*
to
kill
me
.
I
should
have
deserved
it
a
hundred
times
over
,
but
not
to
*NL*
show
him
your
anger
.
Remember
that
all
our
neighbours
are
only
waiting
*NL*
for
an
excuse
to
revenge
themselves
for
your
superiority
.
Remember
that
*NL*
in
1816
you
had
a
hand
in
certain
arrests
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
you
show
neither
consideration
nor
love
for
me
,
''
*NL*
exclaimed
M.
de
Renal
with
all
the
bitterness
evoked
by
such
a
memory
,
*NL*
``
and
I
was
not
made
a
peer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thinking
,
my
dear
,
''
resumed
Madame
de
Renal
with
a
smile
,
``
that
*NL*
I
shall
be
richer
than
you
are
,
that
I
have
been
your
companion
for
*NL*
twelve
years
,
and
that
by
virtue
of
those
qualifications
I
am
entitled
*NL*
to
have
a
voice
in
the
council
and
,
above
all
,
in
to-day
's
business
.
If
*NL*
you
prefer
M.
Julien
to
me
,
''
she
added
,
with
a
touch
of
temper
which
*NL*
was
but
thinly
disguised
,
``
I
am
ready
to
go
and
pass
a
winter
with
my
*NL*
aunt
.
''
These
words
proved
a
lucky
shot
.
They
possessed
a
firmness
which
*NL*
endeavoured
to
clothe
itself
with
courtesy
.
It
decided
M.
de
Renal
,
but
*NL*
following
the
provincial
custom
,
he
still
thought
for
a
long
time
,
and
*NL*
went
again
over
all
his
arguments
;
his
wife
let
him
speak
.
There
was
*NL*
still
a
touch
of
anger
in
his
intonation
.
Finally
two
hours
of
futile
*NL*
rant
exhausted
the
strength
of
a
man
who
had
been
subject
during
the
*NL*
whole
night
to
a
continuous
fit
of
anger
.
He
determined
on
the
line
of
*NL*
conduct
he
was
going
to
follow
with
regard
to
M.
Valenod
,
Julien
and
*NL*
even
Elisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
on
the
point
once
or
twice
during
this
great
scene
*NL*
of
feeling
some
sympathy
for
the
very
real
unhappiness
of
the
man
*NL*
who
had
been
so
dear
to
her
for
twelve
years
.
But
true
passions
are
*NL*
selfish
.
Besides
she
was
expecting
him
every
instant
to
mention
the
*NL*
anonymous
letter
which
he
had
received
the
day
before
and
he
did
not
*NL*
mention
it
.
In
order
to
feel
quite
safe
,
Madame
de
Renal
wanted
to
know
*NL*
the
ideas
which
the
letter
had
succeeding
in
suggesting
to
the
man
on
*NL*
whom
her
fate
depended
,
for
,
in
the
provinces
the
husbands
are
the
*NL*
masters
of
public
opinion
.
A
husband
who
complains
covers
himself
with
*NL*
ridicule
,
an
inconvenience
which
becomes
no
less
dangerous
in
France
*NL*
with
each
succeeding
year
;
but
if
he
refuses
to
provide
his
wife
with
*NL*
money
,
she
falls
to
the
status
of
a
labouring
woman
at
fifteen
sous
a
*NL*
day
,
while
the
virtuous
souls
have
scruples
about
employing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
odalisque
in
the
seraglio
can
love
the
Sultan
with
all
her
might
.
*NL*
He
is
all-powerful
and
she
has
no
hope
of
stealing
his
authority
by
*NL*
a
series
of
little
subtleties
.
The
master
's
vengeance
is
terrible
*NL*
and
bloody
but
martial
and
generous
;
a
dagger
thrust
finishes
*NL*
everything
.
But
it
is
by
stabbing
her
with
public
contempt
that
a
*NL*
nineteenth-century
husband
kills
his
wife
.
It
is
by
shutting
against
*NL*
her
the
doors
of
all
the
drawing-rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Madame
de
Renal
returned
to
her
room
,
her
feeling
of
danger
was
*NL*
vividly
awakened
.
She
was
shocked
by
the
disorder
in
which
she
found
*NL*
it
.
The
locks
of
all
the
pretty
little
boxes
had
been
broken
.
Many
*NL*
planks
in
the
floor
had
been
lifted
up
.
``
He
would
have
no
pity
on
me
,
''
*NL*
she
said
to
herself
.
``
To
think
of
his
spoiling
like
this
,
this
coloured
*NL*
wood
floor
which
he
likes
so
much
;
he
gets
red
with
rage
whenever
one
*NL*
of
his
children
comes
into
it
with
wet
shoes
,
and
now
it
is
spoilt
for
*NL*
ever
.
''
The
spectacle
of
this
violence
immediately
banished
the
last
*NL*
scruples
which
she
was
entertaining
with
respect
to
that
victory
which
*NL*
she
had
won
only
too
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
came
back
with
the
children
a
little
before
the
dinner-bell
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
said
to
him
very
drily
at
dessert
when
the
servant
had
*NL*
left
the
room
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
told
me
about
your
wish
to
go
and
spend
a
fortnight
at
*NL*
Verrieres
.
M.
de
Renal
is
kind
enough
to
give
you
a
holiday
.
You
can
*NL*
leave
as
soon
as
you
like
,
but
the
childrens
'
exercises
will
be
sent
to
*NL*
you
every
day
so
that
they
do
not
waste
their
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
certainly
not
allow
you
more
than
a
week
,
''
said
M.
de
Renal
in
*NL*
a
very
bitter
tone
.
Julien
thought
his
visage
betrayed
the
anxiety
of
a
*NL*
man
who
was
seriously
harassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
not
yet
decided
what
line
to
take
,
''
he
said
to
his
love
during
*NL*
a
moment
when
they
were
alone
together
in
the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
rapidly
recounted
to
him
all
she
had
done
since
the
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
details
are
for
to-night
,
''
she
added
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Feminine
perversity
,
''
thought
Julien
,
``
What
can
be
the
pleasure
,
what
*NL*
can
be
the
instinct
which
induces
them
to
deceive
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
both
enlightened
and
at
the
same
time
blinded
by
your
*NL*
love
,
''
he
said
to
her
with
some
coldness
.
``
Your
conduct
to-day
has
been
*NL*
admirable
,
but
is
it
prudent
for
us
to
try
and
see
each
other
to-night
?
*NL*
This
house
is
paved
with
enemies
.
Just
think
of
Elisa
's
passionate
*NL*
hatred
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
hate
is
very
like
the
passionate
indifference
which
you
no
doubt
*NL*
have
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
if
I
were
indifferent
I
ought
to
save
you
from
the
peril
in
which
*NL*
I
have
plunged
you
.
If
chance
so
wills
it
that
M.
de
Renal
should
speak
*NL*
to
Elisa
,
she
can
acquaint
him
with
everything
in
a
single
word
.
What
*NL*
is
to
prevent
him
from
hiding
near
my
room
fully
armed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
not
even
courage
?
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
,
with
all
the
*NL*
haughtiness
of
a
scion
of
nobility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
never
demean
myself
to
speak
about
my
courage
,
''
said
Julien
,
*NL*
coldly
,
``
it
would
be
mean
to
do
so
.
Let
the
world
judge
by
the
facts
.
*NL*
But
,
''
he
added
,
taking
her
hand
,
``
you
have
no
idea
how
devoted
I
am
to
*NL*
you
and
how
over-joyed
I
am
of
being
able
to
say
good-bye
to
you
before
*NL*
this
cruel
separation

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
MANNERS
OF
PROCEDURE
IN
1830
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Speech
has
been
given
to
man
to
conceal
his
thought
.
*NL*
_
R.P.
Malagrida
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
scarcely
arrived
at
Verrieres
before
he
reproached
himself
*NL*
with
his
injustice
towards
Madame
de
Renal
.
``
I
should
have
despised
*NL*
her
for
a
weakling
of
a
woman
if
she
had
not
had
the
strength
to
go
*NL*
through
with
her
scene
with
M.
de
Renal
.
But
she
has
acquitted
herself
*NL*
like
a
diplomatist
and
I
sympathise
with
the
defeat
of
the
man
who
is
*NL*
my
enemy
.
There
is
a
bourgeois
prejudice
in
my
action
;
my
vanity
is
*NL*
offended
because
M.
de
Renal
is
a
man
.
Men
form
a
vast
and
illustrious
*NL*
body
to
which
I
have
the
honour
to
belong
.
I
am
nothing
but
a
fool
.
''
M.
*NL*
Chelan
had
refused
the
magnificent
apartments
which
the
most
important
*NL*
Liberals
in
the
district
had
offered
him
,
when
his
loss
of
his
living
*NL*
had
necessitated
his
leaving
the
parsonage
.
The
two
rooms
which
he
had
*NL*
rented
were
littered
with
his
books
.
Julien
,
wishing
to
show
Verrieres
*NL*
what
a
priest
could
do
,
went
and
fetched
a
dozen
pinewood
planks
from
*NL*
his
father
,
carried
them
on
his
back
all
along
the
Grande-Rue
,
borrowed
*NL*
some
tools
from
an
old
comrade
and
soon
built
a
kind
of
book-case
in
*NL*
which
he
arranged
M.
Chelan
's
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
corrupted
by
the
vanity
of
the
world
,
''
said
the
*NL*
old
man
to
him
as
he
cried
with
joy
,
``
but
this
is
something
which
well
*NL*
redeems
all
the
childishness
of
that
brilliant
Guard
of
Honour
uniform
*NL*
which
has
made
you
so
many
enemies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
had
ordered
Julien
to
stay
at
his
house
.
No
one
suspected
*NL*
what
had
taken
place
.
The
third
day
after
his
arrival
Julien
saw
no
*NL*
less
a
personage
than
M.
the
sub-prefect
de
Maugiron
come
all
the
way
*NL*
up
the
stairs
to
his
room
.
It
was
only
after
two
long
hours
of
fatuous
*NL*
gossip
and
long-winded
lamentations
about
the
wickedness
of
man
,
the
*NL*
lack
of
honesty
among
the
people
entrusted
with
the
administration
*NL*
of
the
public
funds
,
the
dangers
of
his
poor
France
,
etc.
etc.
,
that
*NL*
Julien
was
at
last
vouchsafed
a
glimpse
of
the
object
of
the
visit
.
*NL*
They
were
already
on
the
landing
of
the
staircase
and
the
poor
half
*NL*
disgraced
tutor
was
escorting
with
all
proper
deference
the
future
*NL*
prefect
of
some
prosperous
department
,
when
the
latter
was
pleased
to
*NL*
take
an
interest
in
Julien
's
fortune
,
to
praise
his
moderation
in
money
*NL*
matters
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
Finally
M.
de
Maugiron
,
embracing
him
in
the
most
*NL*
paternal
way
,
proposed
that
he
should
leave
M.
de
Renal
and
enter
the
*NL*
household
of
an
official
who
had
children
to
educate
and
who
,
like
King
*NL*
Philippe
,
thanked
Heaven
not
so
much
that
they
had
been
granted
to
him
,
*NL*
but
for
the
fact
that
they
had
been
born
in
the
same
neighbourhood
as
*NL*
M.
Julien
.
Their
tutor
would
enjoy
a
salary
of
800
francs
,
payable
*NL*
not
from
month
to
month
,
which
is
not
at
all
aristocratic
,
said
M.
de
*NL*
Maugiron
,
but
quarterly
and
always
in
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Julien
's
turn
now
.
After
he
had
been
bored
for
an
hour
and
a
*NL*
half
by
waiting
for
what
he
had
to
say
,
his
answer
was
perfect
and
,
*NL*
above
all
,
as
long
as
a
bishop
's
charge
.
It
suggested
everything
and
*NL*
yet
said
nothing
clearly
.
It
showed
at
the
same
time
respect
for
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
,
veneration
for
the
public
of
Verrieres
and
gratitude
to
the
*NL*
distinguished
sub-prefect
.
The
sub-prefect
,
astonished
at
finding
*NL*
him
more
Jesuitical
than
himself
,
tried
in
vain
to
obtain
something
*NL*
definite
.
Julien
was
delighted
,
seized
the
opportunity
to
practise
,
and
*NL*
started
his
answer
all
over
again
in
different
language
.
Never
has
an
*NL*
eloquent
minister
who
wished
to
make
the
most
of
the
end
of
a
session
*NL*
when
the
Chamber
really
seemed
desirous
of
waking
up
,
said
less
in
more
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Maugiron
had
scarcely
left
before
Julien
began
to
laugh
like
*NL*
a
madman
.
In
order
to
exploit
his
Jesuitical
smartness
,
he
wrote
a
*NL*
nine-page
letter
to
M.
de
Renal
in
which
he
gave
him
an
account
of
all
*NL*
that
had
been
said
to
him
and
humbly
asked
his
advice
.
``
But
the
old
*NL*
scoundrel
has
not
told
me
the
name
of
the
person
who
is
making
the
*NL*
offer
.
It
is
bound
to
be
M.
Valenod
who
,
no
doubt
,
sees
in
my
exile
at
*NL*
Verrieres
the
result
of
his
anonymous
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
sent
off
his
despatch
and
feeling
as
satisfied
as
a
hunter
who
*NL*
at
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
on
a
fine
autumn
day
,
comes
out
into
*NL*
a
plain
that
abounds
with
game
,
he
went
out
to
go
and
ask
advice
of
*NL*
M.
Chelan
.
But
before
he
had
arrived
at
the
good
cure
's
,
providence
,
*NL*
wishing
to
shower
favours
upon
him
,
threw
in
his
path
M.
de
Valenod
,
*NL*
to
whom
he
owned
quite
freely
that
his
heart
was
torn
in
two
;
a
poor
*NL*
lad
such
as
he
was
owed
an
exclusive
devotion
to
the
vocation
to
which
*NL*
it
had
pleased
Heaven
to
call
him
.
But
vocation
was
not
everything
in
*NL*
this
base
world
.
In
order
to
work
worthily
at
the
vine
of
the
Lord
,
*NL*
and
to
be
not
totally
unworthy
of
so
many
worthy
colleagues
,
it
was
*NL*
necessary
to
be
educated
;
it
was
necessary
to
spend
two
expensive
years
*NL*
at
the
seminary
of
Besancon
;
saving
consequently
became
an
imperative
*NL*
necessity
,
and
was
certainly
much
easier
with
a
salary
of
eight
hundred
*NL*
francs
paid
quarterly
than
with
six
hundred
francs
which
one
received
*NL*
monthly
.
On
the
other
hand
,
did
not
Heaven
,
by
placing
him
by
the
side
*NL*
of
the
young
de
Renals
,
and
especially
by
inspiring
him
with
a
special
*NL*
devotion
to
them
,
seem
to
indicate
that
it
was
not
proper
to
abandon
*NL*
that
education
for
another
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
reached
such
a
degree
of
perfection
in
that
particular
kind
of
*NL*
eloquence
which
has
succeeded
the
drastic
quickness
of
the
empire
,
that
*NL*
he
finished
by
boring
himself
with
the
sound
of
his
own
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
home
he
found
a
valet
of
M.
Valenod
in
full
livery
who
had
*NL*
been
looking
for
him
all
over
the
town
,
with
a
card
inviting
him
to
*NL*
dinner
for
that
same
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
never
been
in
that
man
's
house
.
Only
a
few
days
before
*NL*
he
had
been
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
means
of
giving
him
a
sound
*NL*
thrashing
without
getting
into
trouble
with
the
police
.
Although
*NL*
the
time
of
the
dinner
was
one
o'clock
,
Julien
thought
it
was
more
*NL*
deferential
to
present
himself
at
half-past
twelve
at
the
office
of
M.
*NL*
the
director
of
the
workhouse
.
He
found
him
parading
his
importance
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
a
lot
of
despatch
boxes
.
His
large
black
whiskers
,
his
*NL*
enormous
quantity
of
hair
,
his
Greek
bonnet
placed
across
the
top
of
*NL*
his
head
,
his
immense
pipe
,
his
embroidered
slippers
,
the
big
chains
*NL*
of
gold
crossed
all
over
his
breast
,
and
the
whole
stock-in-trade
of
*NL*
a
provincial
financier
who
considers
himself
prosperous
,
failed
to
*NL*
impose
on
Julien
in
the
least
:
They
only
made
him
think
the
more
of
the
*NL*
thrashing
which
he
owed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
for
the
honour
of
being
introduced
to
Madame
Valenod
.
She
*NL*
was
dressing
and
was
unable
to
receive
him
.
By
way
of
compensation
he
*NL*
had
the
privilege
of
witnessing
the
toilet
of
M.
the
director
of
the
*NL*
workhouse
.
They
subsequently
went
into
the
apartment
of
Madame
Valenod
,
*NL*
who
introduced
her
children
to
him
with
tears
in
her
eyes
.
This
lady
*NL*
was
one
of
the
most
important
in
Verrieres
,
had
a
big
face
like
a
*NL*
man
's
,
on
which
she
had
put
rouge
in
honour
of
this
great
function
.
She
*NL*
displayed
all
the
maternal
pathos
of
which
she
was
capable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
thought
all
the
time
of
Madame
de
Renal
.
His
distrust
made
him
*NL*
only
susceptible
to
those
associations
which
are
called
up
by
their
*NL*
opposites
,
but
he
was
then
affected
to
the
verge
of
breaking
down
.
*NL*
This
tendency
was
increased
by
the
sight
of
the
house
of
the
director
*NL*
of
the
workhouse
.
He
was
shown
over
it
.
Everything
in
it
was
new
and
*NL*
magnificent
,
and
he
was
told
the
price
of
every
article
of
furniture
.
*NL*
But
Julien
detected
a
certain
element
of
sordidness
,
which
smacked
of
*NL*
stolen
money
into
the
bargain
.
Everybody
in
it
,
down
to
the
servants
,
*NL*
had
the
air
of
setting
his
face
in
advance
against
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
collector
of
taxes
,
the
superintendent
of
indirect
taxes
,
the
*NL*
officer
of
gendarmerie
,
and
two
or
three
other
public
officials
arrived
*NL*
with
their
wives
.
They
were
followed
by
some
rich
Liberals
.
Dinner
was
*NL*
announced
.
It
occurred
to
Julien
,
who
was
already
feeling
upset
,
that
*NL*
there
were
some
poor
prisoners
on
the
other
side
of
the
dining-room
*NL*
wall
,
and
that
an
illicit
profit
had
perhaps
been
made
over
their
*NL*
rations
of
meat
in
order
to
purchase
all
that
garish
luxury
with
which
*NL*
they
were
trying
to
overwhelm
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
they
are
hungry
at
this
very
minute
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
He
*NL*
felt
a
choking
in
his
throat
.
He
found
it
impossible
to
eat
and
almost
*NL*
impossible
to
speak
.
Matters
became
much
worse
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
afterwards
;
they
heard
in
the
distance
some
refrains
of
a
popular
song
*NL*
that
was
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
a
little
vulgar
,
which
was
being
sung
*NL*
by
one
of
the
inmates
.
M.
Valenod
gave
a
look
to
one
of
his
liveried
*NL*
servants
who
disappeared
and
soon
there
was
no
more
singing
to
be
*NL*
heard
.
At
that
moment
a
valet
offered
Julien
some
Rhine
wine
in
a
green
*NL*
glass
and
Madame
Valenod
made
a
point
of
asking
him
to
note
that
this
*NL*
wine
cost
nine
francs
a
bottle
in
the
market
.
Julien
held
up
his
green
*NL*
glass
and
said
to
M.
Valenod
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
not
singing
that
wretched
song
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zounds
,
I
should
think
not
,
''
answered
the
triumphant
governor
.
``
I
have
*NL*
made
the
rascals
keep
quiet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
were
too
much
for
Julien
.
He
had
the
manners
of
his
new
*NL*
position
,
but
he
had
not
yet
assimilated
its
spirit
.
In
spite
of
all
*NL*
his
hypocrisy
and
its
frequent
practice
,
he
felt
a
big
tear
drip
down
*NL*
his
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
hide
it
in
the
green
glass
,
but
he
found
it
absolutely
*NL*
impossible
to
do
justice
to
the
Rhine
wine
.
``
Preventing
singing
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
:
Oh
,
my
God
,
and
you
suffer
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
nobody
noticed
his
ill-bred
emotion
.
The
collector
of
*NL*
taxes
had
struck
up
a
royalist
song
.
``
So
this
,
''
reflected
Julien
's
*NL*
conscience
during
the
hubbub
of
the
refrain
which
was
sung
in
chorus
,
*NL*
``
is
the
sordid
prosperity
which
you
will
eventually
reach
,
and
you
will
*NL*
only
enjoy
it
under
these
conditions
and
in
company
like
this
.
You
*NL*
will
,
perhaps
,
have
a
post
worth
twenty
thousand
francs
;
but
while
you
*NL*
gorge
yourself
on
meat
,
you
will
have
to
prevent
a
poor
prisoner
from
*NL*
singing
;
you
will
give
dinners
with
the
money
which
you
have
stolen
out
*NL*
of
his
miserable
rations
and
during
your
dinners
he
will
be
still
more
*NL*
wretched
.
Oh
,
Napoleon
,
how
sweet
it
was
to
climb
to
fortune
in
your
*NL*
way
through
the
dangers
of
a
battle
,
but
to
think
of
aggravating
the
*NL*
pain
of
the
unfortunate
in
this
cowardly
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
own
that
the
weakness
which
Julien
had
been
manifesting
in
this
*NL*
soliloquy
gives
me
a
poor
opinion
of
him
.
He
is
worthy
of
being
the
*NL*
accomplice
of
those
kid-gloved
conspirators
who
purport
to
change
the
*NL*
whole
essence
of
a
great
country
's
existence
,
without
wishing
to
have
*NL*
on
their
conscience
the
most
trivial
scratch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
sharply
brought
back
to
his
role
.
He
had
not
been
invited
to
*NL*
dine
in
such
good
company
simply
to
moon
dreamily
and
say
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
retired
manufacturer
of
cotton
prints
,
a
corresponding
member
of
the
*NL*
Academy
of
Besancon
and
of
that
of
Uzes
,
spoke
to
him
from
the
other
*NL*
end
of
the
table
and
asked
him
if
what
was
said
everywhere
about
his
*NL*
astonishing
progress
in
the
study
of
the
New
Testament
was
really
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
profound
silence
was
suddenly
inaugurated
.
A
New
Testament
in
Latin
*NL*
was
found
as
though
by
magic
in
the
possession
of
the
learned
member
*NL*
of
the
two
Academies
.
After
Julien
had
answered
,
part
of
a
sentence
*NL*
in
Latin
was
read
at
random
.
Julien
then
recited
.
His
memory
proved
*NL*
faithful
and
the
prodigy
was
admired
with
all
the
boisterous
energy
of
*NL*
the
end
of
dinner
.
Julien
looked
at
the
flushed
faces
of
the
ladies
.
A
*NL*
good
many
were
not
so
plain
.
He
recognised
the
wife
of
the
collector
,
*NL*
who
was
a
fine
singer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ashamed
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
to
talk
Latin
so
long
before
these
*NL*
ladies
,
''
he
said
,
turning
his
eyes
on
her
.
``
If
M.
Rubigneau
,
''
that
was
*NL*
the
name
of
the
member
of
the
two
Academies
,
``
will
be
kind
enough
to
*NL*
read
a
Latin
sentence
at
random
instead
of
answering
by
following
the
*NL*
Latin
text
,
I
will
try
to
translate
it
impromptu
.
''
This
second
test
*NL*
completed
his
glory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
Liberals
were
there
,
who
,
though
rich
,
were
none
the
less
the
*NL*
happy
fathers
of
children
capable
of
obtaining
scholarships
,
and
had
*NL*
consequently
been
suddenly
converted
at
the
last
mission
.
In
spite
of
*NL*
this
diplomatic
step
,
M.
de
Renal
had
never
been
willing
to
receive
*NL*
them
in
his
house
.
These
worthy
people
,
who
only
knew
Julien
by
name
*NL*
and
from
having
seen
him
on
horseback
on
the
day
of
the
king
of
--
's
*NL*
entry
,
were
his
most
noisy
admirers
.
``
When
will
those
fools
get
tired
*NL*
of
listening
to
this
Biblical
language
,
which
they
do
n't
understand
in
*NL*
the
least
,
''
he
thought
.
But
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
language
amused
them
*NL*
by
its
strangeness
and
made
them
smile
.
But
Julien
got
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
six
o'clock
struck
he
got
up
gravely
and
talked
about
a
chapter
in
*NL*
Ligorio
's
New
Theology
which
he
had
to
learn
by
heart
to
recite
on
the
*NL*
following
day
to
M.
Chelan
,
``
for
,
''
he
added
pleasantly
,
``
my
business
is
*NL*
to
get
lessons
said
by
heart
to
me
,
and
to
say
them
by
heart
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
much
laughter
and
admiration
;
such
is
the
kind
of
wit
which
*NL*
is
customary
in
Verrieres
.
Julien
had
already
got
up
and
in
spite
of
*NL*
etiquette
everybody
got
up
as
well
,
so
great
is
the
dominion
exercised
*NL*
by
genius
.
Madame
Valenod
kept
him
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
.
He
*NL*
really
must
hear
her
children
recite
their
catechisms
.
They
made
the
*NL*
most
absurd
mistakes
which
he
alone
noticed
.
He
was
careful
not
to
*NL*
point
them
out
.
``
What
ignorance
of
the
first
principles
of
religion
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
.
Finally
he
bowed
and
thought
he
could
get
away
;
but
they
*NL*
insisted
on
his
trying
a
fable
of
La
Fontaine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
author
is
quite
immoral
,
''
said
Julien
to
Madame
Valenod
.
A
*NL*
certain
fable
on
Messire
Jean
Chouart
dares
to
pour
ridicule
on
*NL*
all
that
we
hold
most
venerable
.
He
is
shrewdly
blamed
by
the
best
*NL*
commentators
.
Before
Julien
left
he
received
four
or
five
invitations
*NL*
to
dinner
.
``
This
young
man
is
an
honour
to
the
department
,
''
cried
all
*NL*
the
guests
in
chorus
.
They
even
went
so
far
as
to
talk
of
a
pension
*NL*
voted
out
of
the
municipal
funds
to
put
him
in
the
position
of
*NL*
continuing
his
studies
at
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
rash
idea
was
resounding
through
the
dining-room
Julien
*NL*
had
swiftly
reached
the
front
door
.
``
You
scum
,
you
scum
,
''
he
cried
,
*NL*
three
or
four
times
in
succession
in
a
low
voice
as
he
indulged
in
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
breathing
in
the
fresh
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
quite
an
aristocrat
at
this
moment
,
though
he
was
the
very
*NL*
man
who
had
been
shocked
for
so
long
a
period
by
the
haughty
smile
of
*NL*
disdainful
superiority
which
he
detected
behind
all
the
courtesies
*NL*
addressed
to
him
at
M.
de
Renal
's
.
He
could
not
help
realising
the
*NL*
extreme
difference
.
Why
let
us
even
forget
the
fact
of
its
being
money
*NL*
stolen
from
the
poor
inmates
,
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
away
,
let
*NL*
us
forget
also
their
stopping
the
singing
.
M.
de
Renal
would
never
*NL*
think
of
telling
his
guests
the
price
of
each
bottle
of
wine
with
*NL*
which
he
regales
them
,
and
as
for
this
M.
Valenod
,
and
his
chronic
*NL*
cataloguing
of
his
various
belongings
,
he
can
not
talk
of
his
house
,
his
*NL*
estate
,
etc.
,
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
without
saying
,
``
Your
house
,
*NL*
your
estate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
lady
,
who
was
apparently
so
keenly
alive
to
the
delights
of
*NL*
decorum
,
had
just
had
an
awful
scene
during
the
dinner
with
a
servant
*NL*
who
had
broken
a
wine-glass
and
spoilt
one
of
her
dozens
;
and
the
*NL*
servant
too
had
answered
her
back
with
the
utmost
insolence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
collection
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
;
``
I
would
not
live
like
*NL*
they
do
were
they
to
give
me
half
of
all
they
steal
.
I
shall
give
*NL*
myself
away
one
fine
day
.
I
should
not
be
able
to
restrain
myself
from
*NL*
expressing
the
disgust
with
which
they
inspire
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
necessary
,
however
,
to
obey
Madame
de
Renal
's
injunction
and
be
*NL*
present
at
several
dinners
of
the
same
kind
.
Julien
was
the
fashion
;
he
*NL*
was
forgiven
his
Guard
of
Honour
uniform
,
or
rather
that
indiscretion
*NL*
was
the
real
cause
of
his
successes
.
Soon
the
only
question
in
*NL*
Verrieres
was
whether
M.
de
Renal
or
M.
the
director
of
the
workhouse
*NL*
would
be
the
victor
in
the
struggle
for
the
clever
young
man
.
These
*NL*
gentlemen
formed
,
together
with
M.
Maslon
,
a
triumvirate
which
had
*NL*
tyrannised
over
the
town
for
a
number
of
years
.
People
were
jealous
of
*NL*
the
mayor
,
and
the
Liberals
had
good
cause
for
complaint
,
but
,
after
*NL*
all
,
he
was
noble
and
born
for
a
superior
position
,
while
M.
Valenod
's
*NL*
father
had
not
left
him
six
hundred
francs
a
year
.
His
career
had
*NL*
necessitated
a
transition
from
pitying
the
shabby
green
suit
which
had
*NL*
been
so
notorious
in
his
youth
,
to
envying
the
Norman
horses
,
his
gold
*NL*
chains
,
his
Paris
clothes
,
his
whole
present
prosperity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
thought
that
he
had
discovered
one
honest
man
in
the
whirlpool
*NL*
of
this
novel
world
.
He
was
a
geometrist
named
Gros
,
and
had
the
*NL*
reputation
of
being
a
Jacobin
.
Julien
,
who
had
vowed
to
say
nothing
*NL*
but
that
which
he
disbelieved
himself
,
was
obliged
to
watch
himself
*NL*
carefully
when
speaking
to
M.
Gros
.
He
received
big
packets
of
*NL*
exercises
from
Vergy
.
He
was
advised
to
visit
his
father
frequently
,
*NL*
and
he
fulfilled
his
unpleasant
duty
.
In
a
word
he
was
patching
his
*NL*
reputation
together
pretty
well
,
when
he
was
thoroughly
surprised
to
*NL*
find
himself
woken
up
one
morning
by
two
hands
held
over
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Madame
de
Renal
who
had
made
a
trip
to
the
town
,
and
who
,
*NL*
running
up
the
stairs
four
at
a
time
while
she
left
her
children
*NL*
playing
with
a
pet
rabbit
,
had
reached
Julien
's
room
a
moment
before
*NL*
her
sons
.
This
moment
was
delicious
but
very
short
:
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
had
disappeared
when
the
children
arrived
with
the
rabbit
which
*NL*
they
wanted
to
show
to
their
friend
.
Julien
gave
them
all
a
hearty
*NL*
welcome
,
including
the
rabbit
.
He
seemed
at
home
again
.
He
felt
that
*NL*
he
loved
these
children
and
that
he
enjoyed
gossiping
with
them
.
He
*NL*
was
astonished
at
the
sweetness
of
their
voices
,
at
the
simplicity
*NL*
and
dignity
of
their
little
ways
;
he
felt
he
needed
to
purge
his
*NL*
imagination
of
all
the
vulgar
practices
and
all
the
unpleasantnesses
*NL*
among
which
he
had
been
living
in
Verrieres
.
For
there
everyone
was
*NL*
always
frightened
of
being
scored
off
,
and
luxury
and
poverty
were
at
*NL*
daggers
drawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
with
whom
he
would
dine
would
enter
into
confidences
over
*NL*
the
joint
which
were
as
humiliating
for
themselves
as
they
were
*NL*
nauseating
to
the
hearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
others
,
who
are
nobles
,
you
are
right
to
be
proud
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
,
as
he
gave
her
an
account
of
all
the
dinners
which
he
*NL*
had
put
up
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
the
fashion
then
,
''
and
she
laughed
heartily
as
she
thought
of
*NL*
the
rouge
which
Madame
Valenod
thought
herself
obliged
to
put
on
each
*NL*
time
she
expected
Julien
.
``
I
think
she
has
designs
on
your
heart
,
''
she
*NL*
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
breakfast
was
delicious
.
The
presence
of
the
children
,
though
*NL*
apparently
embarrassing
,
increased
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
happiness
of
*NL*
the
party
.
The
poor
children
did
not
know
how
to
give
expression
to
the
*NL*
joy
at
seeing
Julien
again
.
The
servants
had
not
failed
to
tell
them
*NL*
that
he
had
been
offered
two
hundred
francs
a
year
more
to
educate
the
*NL*
little
Valenods
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stanislas-Xavier
,
who
was
still
pale
from
his
illness
,
suddenly
asked
*NL*
his
mother
in
the
middle
of
the
breakfast
,
the
value
of
his
silver
*NL*
cover
and
of
the
goblet
in
which
he
was
drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
want
to
know
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
sell
them
to
give
the
price
to
M.
Julien
so
that
he
sha
n't
*NL*
be
_
done
_
if
he
stays
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
kissed
him
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
His
mother
wept
*NL*
unrestrainedly
,
for
Julien
took
Stanislas
on
his
knees
and
explained
to
*NL*
him
that
he
should
not
use
the
word
``
done
''
which
,
when
employed
in
that
*NL*
meaning
was
an
expression
only
fit
for
the
servants
'
hall
.
Seeing
the
*NL*
pleasure
which
he
was
giving
to
Madame
de
Renal
,
he
tried
to
explain
*NL*
the
meaning
of
being
``
done
''
by
picturesque
illustrations
which
amused
*NL*
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
said
Stanislas
,
``
it
's
like
the
crow
who
is
silly
enough
*NL*
to
let
his
cheese
fall
and
be
taken
by
the
fox
who
has
been
playing
the
*NL*
flatterer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
felt
mad
with
joy
and
covered
her
children
with
kisses
,
*NL*
a
process
which
involved
her
leaning
a
little
on
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
door
opened
.
It
was
M.
de
Renal
.
His
severe
and
*NL*
discontented
expression
contrasted
strangely
with
the
sweet
joy
*NL*
which
his
presence
dissipated
.
Madame
de
Renal
grew
pale
,
she
felt
*NL*
herself
incapable
of
denying
anything
.
Julien
seized
command
of
the
*NL*
conversation
and
commenced
telling
M.
the
mayor
in
a
loud
voice
the
*NL*
incident
of
the
silver
goblet
which
Stanislas
wanted
to
sell
.
He
was
*NL*
quite
certain
this
story
would
not
be
appreciated
.
M.
de
Renal
first
*NL*
of
all
frowned
mechanically
at
the
mere
mention
of
money
.
Any
allusion
*NL*
to
that
mineral
,
he
was
accustomed
to
say
,
is
always
a
prelude
to
some
*NL*
demand
made
upon
my
purse
.
But
this
was
something
more
than
a
mere
*NL*
money
matter
.
His
suspicions
were
increased
.
The
air
of
happiness
which
*NL*
animated
his
family
during
his
absence
was
not
calculated
to
smooth
*NL*
matters
over
with
a
man
who
was
a
prey
to
so
touchy
a
vanity
.
``
Yes
,
*NL*
yes
,
''
he
said
,
as
his
wife
started
to
praise
to
him
the
combined
grace
*NL*
and
cleverness
of
the
way
in
which
Julien
gave
ideas
to
his
pupils
.
``
I
*NL*
know
,
he
renders
me
hateful
to
my
own
children
.
It
is
easy
enough
for
*NL*
him
to
make
himself
a
hundred
times
more
loveable
to
them
than
I
am
*NL*
myself
,
though
after
all
,
I
am
the
master
.
In
this
century
everything
*NL*
tends
to
make
_
legitimate
_
authority
unpopular
.
Poor
France
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
had
not
stopped
to
examine
the
fine
shades
of
the
*NL*
welcome
which
her
husband
gave
her
.
She
had
just
caught
a
glimpse
of
*NL*
the
possibility
of
spending
twelve
hours
with
Julien
.
She
had
a
lot
of
*NL*
purchases
to
make
in
the
town
and
declared
that
she
positively
insisted
*NL*
in
going
to
dine
at
the
tavern
.
She
stuck
to
her
idea
in
spite
of
all
*NL*
her
husband
's
protests
and
remonstrances
.
The
children
were
delighted
*NL*
with
the
mere
word
tavern
,
which
our
modern
prudery
denounces
with
so
*NL*
much
gusto
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
left
his
wife
in
the
first
draper
's
shop
which
she
entered
*NL*
and
went
to
pay
some
visits
.
He
came
back
more
morose
than
he
had
*NL*
been
in
the
morning
.
He
was
convinced
that
the
whole
town
was
busy
*NL*
with
himself
and
Julien
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
no
one
had
yet
given
him
*NL*
any
inkling
as
to
the
more
offensive
part
of
the
public
gossip
.
Those
*NL*
items
which
had
been
repeated
to
M.
the
mayor
dealt
exclusively
with
*NL*
the
question
of
whether
Julien
would
remain
with
him
with
six
hundred
*NL*
francs
,
or
would
accept
the
eight
hundred
francs
offered
by
M.
the
*NL*
director
of
the
workhouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
director
,
when
he
met
M.
de
Renal
in
society
,
gave
him
the
cold
*NL*
shoulder
.
These
tactics
were
not
without
cleverness
.
There
is
no
*NL*
impulsiveness
in
the
provinces
.
Sensations
are
so
rare
there
that
they
*NL*
are
never
allowed
to
be
wasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
le
Valenod
was
what
is
called
a
hundred
miles
from
Paris
a
_
faraud
_
;
*NL*
that
means
a
coarse
imprudent
type
of
man
.
His
triumphant
existence
*NL*
since
1815
had
consolidated
his
natural
qualities
.
He
reigned
,
so
*NL*
to
say
,
in
Verrieres
subject
to
the
orders
of
M.
de
Renal
;
but
as
*NL*
he
was
much
more
energetic
,
was
ashamed
of
nothing
,
had
a
finger
in
*NL*
everything
,
and
was
always
going
about
writing
and
speaking
,
and
*NL*
was
oblivious
of
all
snubs
,
he
had
,
although
without
any
personal
*NL*
pretensions
,
eventually
come
to
equal
the
mayor
in
reputation
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
.
M.
Valenod
had
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
said
to
the
local
tradesmen
``
Give
me
the
two
biggest
fools
among
your
*NL*
number
;
''
to
the
men
of
law
``
Show
me
the
two
greatest
dunces
;
''
to
the
*NL*
sanitary
officials
``
Point
out
to
me
the
two
biggest
charlatans
.
''
When
*NL*
he
had
thus
collected
the
most
impudent
members
of
each
separate
*NL*
calling
,
he
had
practically
said
to
them
,
``
Let
us
reign
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
manners
of
those
people
were
offensive
to
M.
de
Renal
.
The
*NL*
coarseness
of
Valenod
took
offence
at
nothing
,
not
even
the
frequency
*NL*
with
which
the
little
abbe
Maslon
would
give
the
lie
to
him
in
public
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
middle
of
all
this
prosperity
M.
Valenod
found
it
necessary
*NL*
to
reassure
himself
by
a
number
of
petty
acts
of
insolence
on
the
*NL*
score
of
the
crude
truths
which
he
well
realised
that
everybody
was
*NL*
justified
in
addressing
to
him
.
His
activity
had
redoubled
since
the
*NL*
fears
which
the
visit
of
M.
Appert
had
left
him
.
He
had
made
three
*NL*
journeys
to
Besancon
.
He
wrote
several
letters
by
each
courier
;
he
sent
*NL*
others
by
unknown
men
who
came
to
his
house
at
nightfall
.
Perhaps
he
*NL*
had
been
wrong
in
securing
the
dismissal
of
the
old
cure
Chelan
.
For
*NL*
this
piece
of
vindictiveness
had
resulted
in
his
being
considered
an
*NL*
extremely
malicious
man
by
several
pious
women
of
good
birth
.
Besides
,
*NL*
the
rendering
of
this
service
had
placed
him
in
absolute
dependence
*NL*
on
M.
the
Grand
Vicar
de
Frilair
from
whom
he
received
some
strange
*NL*
commissions
.
He
had
reached
this
point
in
his
intrigues
when
he
had
*NL*
yielded
to
the
pleasure
of
writing
an
anonymous
letter
,
and
thus
*NL*
increasing
his
embarrassment
.
His
wife
declared
to
him
that
she
wanted
*NL*
to
have
Julien
in
her
house
;
her
vanity
was
intoxicated
with
the
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
being
his
position
M.
Valenod
imagined
in
advance
a
decisive
*NL*
scene
with
his
old
colleague
M.
de
Renal
.
The
latter
might
address
*NL*
to
him
some
harsh
words
,
which
he
would
not
mind
much
;
but
he
might
*NL*
write
to
Besancon
and
even
to
Paris
.
Some
minister
's
cousin
might
*NL*
suddenly
fall
down
on
Verrieres
and
take
over
the
workhouse
.
Valenod
*NL*
thought
of
coming
to
terms
with
the
Liberals
.
It
was
for
that
purpose
*NL*
that
several
of
them
had
been
invited
to
the
dinner
when
Julien
was
*NL*
present
.
He
would
have
obtained
powerful
support
against
the
mayor
but
*NL*
the
elections
might
supervene
,
and
it
was
only
too
evident
that
the
*NL*
directorship
of
the
workhouse
was
inconsistent
with
voting
on
the
wrong
*NL*
side
.
Madame
de
Renal
had
made
a
shrewd
guess
at
this
intrigue
,
and
*NL*
while
she
explained
it
to
Julien
as
he
gave
her
his
arm
to
pass
from
*NL*
one
shop
to
another
,
they
found
themselves
gradually
taken
as
far
as
*NL*
the
_
Cours
de
la
Fidelite
_
where
they
spent
several
hours
nearly
as
*NL*
tranquil
as
those
at
Vergy
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
M.
Valenod
was
trying
to
put
off
a
definite
crisis
*NL*
with
his
old
patron
by
himself
assuming
the
aggressive
.
These
tactics
*NL*
succeeded
on
this
particular
day
,
but
aggravated
the
mayor
's
bad
*NL*
temper
.
Never
has
vanity
at
close
grips
with
all
the
harshness
and
*NL*
meanness
of
a
pettifogging
love
of
money
reduced
a
man
to
a
more
sorry
*NL*
condition
than
that
of
M.
de
Renal
when
he
entered
the
tavern
.
The
*NL*
children
,
on
the
other
hand
,
had
never
been
more
joyful
and
more
merry
.
*NL*
This
contrast
put
the
finishing
touch
on
his
pique
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
as
I
can
see
I
am
not
wanted
in
my
family
,
''
he
said
as
he
*NL*
entered
in
a
tone
which
he
meant
to
be
impressive
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
answer
,
his
wife
took
him
on
one
side
and
declared
that
it
was
*NL*
essential
to
send
Julien
away
.
The
hours
of
happiness
which
she
had
*NL*
just
enjoyed
had
given
her
again
the
ease
and
firmness
of
demeanour
*NL*
necessary
to
follow
out
the
plan
of
campaign
which
she
had
been
*NL*
hatching
for
a
fortnight
.
The
finishing
touch
to
the
trouble
of
the
*NL*
poor
mayor
of
Verrieres
was
the
fact
that
he
knew
that
they
joked
*NL*
publicly
in
the
town
about
his
love
for
cash
.
Valenod
was
as
generous
*NL*
as
a
thief
,
and
on
his
side
had
acquitted
himself
brilliantly
in
the
*NL*
last
five
or
six
collections
for
the
Brotherhood
of
St.
Joseph
,
the
*NL*
congregation
of
the
Virgin
,
the
congregation
of
the
Holy
Sacrament
,
*NL*
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
's
name
had
been
seen
more
than
once
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
list
of
gentlefolk
of
Verrieres
,
and
the
surrounding
neighbourhood
*NL*
who
were
adroitly
classified
in
the
list
of
the
collecting
brethren
*NL*
according
to
the
amount
of
their
offerings
.
It
was
in
vain
that
he
said
*NL*
that
he
was
_
not
making
money
_
.
The
clergy
stands
no
nonsense
in
such
*NL*
matters
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
SORROWS
OF
AN
OFFICIAL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Il
piacere
di
alzar
la
testa
tutto
l'anno
,
e
ben
pagato
*NL*
da
certi
quarti
d'ora
che
bisogna
passar
.
--
_
Casti
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
leave
this
petty
man
to
his
petty
fears
;
why
did
he
take
a
man
*NL*
of
spirit
into
his
household
when
he
needed
someone
with
the
soul
*NL*
of
a
valet
?
Why
ca
n't
he
select
his
staff
?
The
ordinary
trend
of
*NL*
the
nineteenth
century
is
that
when
a
noble
and
powerful
individual
*NL*
encounters
a
man
of
spirit
,
he
kills
him
,
exiles
him
and
imprisons
him
,
*NL*
or
so
humiliates
him
that
the
other
is
foolish
enough
to
die
of
grief
.
*NL*
In
this
country
it
so
happens
that
it
is
not
merely
the
man
of
spirit
*NL*
who
suffers
.
The
great
misfortunes
of
the
little
towns
of
France
and
of
*NL*
representative
governments
,
like
that
of
New
York
,
is
that
they
find
*NL*
it
impossible
to
forget
the
existence
of
individuals
like
M.
de
Renal
.
*NL*
It
is
these
men
who
make
public
opinion
in
a
town
of
twenty
thousand
*NL*
inhabitants
,
and
public
opinion
is
terrible
in
a
country
which
has
a
*NL*
charter
of
liberty
.
A
man
,
though
of
a
naturally
noble
and
generous
*NL*
disposition
,
who
would
have
been
your
friend
in
the
natural
course
of
*NL*
events
,
but
who
happens
to
live
a
hundred
leagues
off
,
judges
you
by
*NL*
the
public
opinion
of
your
town
which
is
made
by
those
fools
who
have
*NL*
chanced
to
be
born
noble
,
rich
and
conservative
.
Unhappy
is
the
man
who
*NL*
distinguishes
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
after
dinner
they
left
for
Vergy
,
but
the
next
day
but
*NL*
one
Julien
saw
the
whole
family
return
to
Verrieres
.
An
hour
had
not
*NL*
passed
before
he
discovered
to
his
great
surprise
that
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
had
some
mystery
up
her
sleeve
.
Whenever
he
came
into
the
room
she
*NL*
would
break
off
her
conversation
with
her
husband
and
would
almost
*NL*
seem
to
desire
that
he
should
go
away
.
Julien
did
not
need
to
be
given
*NL*
this
hint
twice
.
He
became
cold
and
reserved
.
Madame
de
Renal
noticed
*NL*
it
and
did
not
ask
for
an
explanation
.
``
Is
she
going
to
give
me
a
*NL*
successor
,
''
thought
Julien
.
``
And
to
think
of
her
being
so
familiar
*NL*
with
me
the
day
before
yesterday
,
but
that
is
how
these
great
ladies
*NL*
are
said
to
act
.
It
's
just
like
kings
.
One
never
gets
any
more
warning
*NL*
than
the
disgraced
minister
who
enters
his
house
to
find
his
letter
of
*NL*
dismissal
.
''
Julien
noticed
that
these
conversations
which
left
off
so
*NL*
abruptly
at
his
approach
,
often
dealt
with
a
big
house
which
belonged
*NL*
to
the
municipality
of
Verrieres
,
a
house
which
though
old
was
large
*NL*
and
commodious
and
situated
opposite
the
church
in
the
most
busy
*NL*
commercial
district
of
the
town
.
``
What
connection
can
there
be
between
*NL*
this
house
and
a
new
lover
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
In
his
chagrin
he
*NL*
repeated
to
himself
the
pretty
verses
of
Francis
I.
which
seemed
novel
*NL*
to
him
,
for
Madame
de
Renal
had
only
taught
him
them
a
month
before
:
*NL*
*NL*
Souvent
femme
varie
*NL*
Bien
fol
est
qui
s
'
y
fie
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
took
the
mail
to
Besancon
.
This
journey
was
a
matter
of
two
*NL*
hours
.
He
seemed
extremely
harassed
.
On
his
return
he
threw
a
big
grey
*NL*
paper
parcel
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
that
silly
business
,
''
he
said
to
his
wife
.
An
hour
afterwards
*NL*
Julien
saw
the
bill-poster
carrying
the
big
parcel
.
He
followed
him
*NL*
eagerly
.
``
I
shall
learn
the
secret
at
the
first
street
corner
.
''
He
*NL*
waited
impatiently
behind
the
bill-poster
who
was
smearing
the
back
of
*NL*
the
poster
with
his
big
brush
.
It
had
scarcely
been
put
in
its
place
*NL*
before
Julien
's
curiosity
saw
the
detailed
announcement
of
the
putting
*NL*
up
for
public
auction
of
that
big
old
house
whose
name
had
figured
so
*NL*
frequently
in
M.
de
Renal
's
conversations
with
his
wife
.
The
auction
of
*NL*
the
lease
was
announced
for
to-morrow
at
two
o'clock
in
the
Town
Hall
*NL*
after
the
extinction
of
the
third
fire
.
Julien
was
very
disappointed
.
*NL*
He
found
the
time
a
little
short
.
How
could
there
be
time
to
apprise
*NL*
all
the
other
would-be
purchasers
.
But
,
moreover
,
the
bill
,
which
was
*NL*
dated
a
fortnight
back
,
and
which
he
read
again
in
its
entirety
in
*NL*
three
distinct
places
,
taught
him
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
visit
the
house
which
was
to
let
.
The
porter
,
who
had
not
*NL*
seen
him
approach
,
was
saying
mysteriously
to
a
neighbour
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
,
pooh
,
waste
of
time
.
M.
Maslon
has
promised
him
that
he
shall
*NL*
have
it
for
three
hundred
francs
;
and
,
as
the
mayor
kicked
,
he
has
been
*NL*
summoned
to
the
bishop
's
palace
by
M.
the
Grand
Vicar
de
Frilair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
arrival
seemed
very
much
to
disconcert
the
two
friends
who
*NL*
did
not
say
another
word
.
Julien
made
a
point
of
being
present
at
the
*NL*
auction
of
the
lease
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
crowd
in
the
badly-lighted
hall
,
but
everybody
kept
*NL*
quizzing
each
other
in
quite
a
singular
way
.
All
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
*NL*
table
where
Julien
perceived
three
little
lighted
candle-ends
on
a
tin
*NL*
plate
.
The
usher
was
crying
out
``
Three
hundred
francs
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
hundred
francs
,
that
's
a
bit
too
thick
,
''
said
a
man
to
his
*NL*
neighbour
in
a
low
voice
.
Julien
was
between
the
two
of
them
.
``
It
's
*NL*
worth
more
than
eight
hundred
,
I
will
raise
the
bidding
.
''
``
It
's
cutting
*NL*
off
your
nose
to
spite
your
face
.
What
will
you
gain
by
putting
M.
*NL*
Maslon
,
M.
Valenod
,
the
Bishop
,
this
terrible
Grand
Vicar
de
Frilair
*NL*
and
the
whole
gang
on
your
track
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
hundred
and
twenty
francs
,
''
shouted
out
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damned
brute
,
''
answered
his
neighbour
.
``
Why
here
we
have
a
spy
of
the
*NL*
mayor
,
''
he
added
,
designating
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
turned
sharply
round
to
punish
this
remark
,
but
the
two
,
*NL*
Franc-comtois
,
were
no
longer
paying
any
attention
to
him
.
Their
*NL*
coolness
gave
him
back
his
own
.
At
that
moment
the
last
candle-end
*NL*
went
out
and
the
usher
's
drawling
voice
awarded
the
house
to
M.
de
St.
*NL*
Giraud
of
the
office
of
the
prefecture
of
--
for
a
term
of
nine
years
*NL*
and
for
a
rent
of
320
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
mayor
had
left
the
hall
,
the
gossip
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
thirty
francs
that
Grogeot
's
recklessness
is
landing
the
*NL*
municipality
in
for
,
''
said
one
--
``
But
,
''
answered
another
,
``
M.
de
Saint
*NL*
Giraud
will
revenge
himself
on
Grogeot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
monstrous
,
''
said
a
big
man
on
Julien
's
left
.
``
A
house
which
I
*NL*
myself
would
have
given
eight
hundred
francs
for
my
factory
,
and
I
*NL*
would
have
got
a
good
bargain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
''
answered
a
young
manufacturer
,
``
does
n't
M.
de
St.
Giraud
belong
*NL*
to
the
congregation
?
Have
n't
his
four
children
got
scholarships
?
poor
*NL*
man
!
The
community
of
Verrieres
must
give
him
five
hundred
francs
over
*NL*
and
above
his
salary
,
that
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
say
that
the
mayor
was
not
able
to
stop
it
,
''
remarked
a
third
.
*NL*
``
For
he
's
an
ultra
he
is
,
I
'm
glad
to
say
,
but
he
does
n't
steal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
he
?
''
answered
another
.
``
Suppose
it
's
simply
a
mere
game
of
*NL*
`
snap
'
-LSB-
1
-RSB-
then
.
Everything
goes
into
a
big
common
purse
,
and
everything
*NL*
is
divided
up
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
But
here
's
that
little
Sorel
,
*NL*
let
's
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
got
home
in
a
very
bad
temper
.
He
found
Madame
de
Renal
very
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
from
the
auction
?
''
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madam
,
where
I
had
the
honour
of
passing
for
a
spy
of
M.
the
*NL*
Mayor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
had
taken
my
advice
,
he
would
have
gone
on
a
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Monsieur
de
Renal
appeared
:
he
looked
very
dismal
.
The
*NL*
dinner
passed
without
a
single
word
.
Monsieur
de
Renal
ordered
Julien
*NL*
to
follow
the
children
to
Vergy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
endeavoured
to
console
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
be
used
to
it
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
they
were
seated
in
silence
around
the
domestic
hearth
.
*NL*
The
crackle
of
the
burnt
pinewood
was
their
only
distraction
.
It
*NL*
was
one
of
those
moments
of
silence
which
happen
in
the
most
united
*NL*
families
.
One
of
the
children
cried
out
gaily
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody
's
ringing
,
somebody
's
ringing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zounds
!
supposing
it
's
Monsieur
de
Saint
Giraud
who
has
come
under
*NL*
the
pretext
of
thanking
me
,
''
exclaimed
the
mayor
.
``
I
will
give
him
a
*NL*
dressing
down
.
It
is
outrageous
.
It
is
Valenod
to
whom
he
'll
feel
under
*NL*
an
obligation
,
and
it
is
I
who
get
compromised
.
What
shall
I
say
if
*NL*
those
damned
Jacobin
journalists
get
hold
of
this
anecdote
,
and
turn
me
*NL*
into
a
M.
Nonante
Cinque
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
good-looking
man
,
with
big
black
whiskers
,
entered
at
this
*NL*
moment
,
preceded
by
the
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
the
mayor
,
I
am
Signor
Geronimo
.
Here
is
a
letter
which
M.
*NL*
the
Chevalier
de
Beauvoisis
,
who
is
attached
to
the
Embassy
of
Naples
,
*NL*
gave
me
for
you
on
my
departure
.
That
is
only
nine
days
ago
,
added
*NL*
Signor
Geronimo
,
gaily
looking
at
Madame
de
Renal
.
Your
cousin
,
and
my
*NL*
good
friend
,
Signor
de
Beauvoisis
says
that
you
know
Italian
,
Madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Neapolitan
's
good
humour
changed
this
gloomy
evening
into
a
very
*NL*
gay
one
.
Madame
de
Renal
insisted
upon
giving
him
supper
.
She
put
the
*NL*
whole
house
on
the
go
.
She
wanted
to
free
Julien
at
any
price
from
the
*NL*
imputation
of
espionage
which
she
had
heard
already
twice
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Signor
Geronimo
was
an
excellent
singer
,
excellent
company
,
and
had
*NL*
very
gay
qualities
which
,
at
any
rate
in
France
,
are
hardly
compatible
*NL*
with
each
other
.
After
dinner
he
sang
a
little
duet
with
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
,
and
told
some
charming
tales
.
At
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
*NL*
children
protested
,
when
Julien
suggested
that
they
should
go
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
of
those
stories
,
''
said
the
eldest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
own
,
Signorino
,
''
answered
Signor
Geronimo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
years
ago
I
was
,
like
you
,
a
young
pupil
of
the
Naples
*NL*
Conservatoire
.
I
mean
I
was
your
age
,
but
I
did
not
have
the
honour
to
*NL*
be
the
son
of
the
distinguished
mayor
of
the
pretty
town
of
Verrieres
.
''
*NL*
This
phrase
made
M.
de
Renal
sigh
,
and
look
at
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Signor
Zingarelli
,
''
continued
the
young
singer
,
somewhat
exaggerating
*NL*
his
action
,
and
thus
making
the
children
burst
into
laughter
,
``
Signor
*NL*
Zingarelli
was
an
excellent
though
severe
master
.
He
is
not
popular
at
*NL*
the
Conservatoire
,
but
he
insists
on
the
pretence
being
kept
up
that
he
*NL*
is
.
I
went
out
as
often
as
I
could
.
I
used
to
go
to
the
little
Theatre
*NL*
de
San
Carlino
,
where
I
used
to
hear
divine
music
.
But
heavens
!
the
*NL*
question
was
to
scrape
together
the
eight
sous
which
were
the
price
of
*NL*
admission
to
the
parterre
?
An
enormous
sum
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
children
and
watching
them
laugh
.
``
Signor
Giovannone
,
director
of
the
*NL*
San
Carlino
,
heard
me
sing
.
I
was
sixteen
.
`
That
child
is
a
treasure

*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Would
you
like
me
to
engage
you

my
dear
boy

he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*

And
how
much
will
you
give
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Forty
ducats
a
month
.

That
is
one
hundred
and
sixty
francs

I
thought
the
gates
of
heaven
had
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
But
,
'
I
said
to
Giovannone
,
`
how
shall
I
get
the
strict
Zingarelli
to
*NL*
let
me
go
out
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
_
Lascia
fare
a
me
_
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
it
to
me
,
''
exclaimed
the
eldest
of
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
,
my
young
sir
.
Signor
Giovannone
he
says
to
me
,
`
First
*NL*
sign
this
little
piece
of
paper

dear
friend

I
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
gives
me
three
ducats
.
I
had
never
seen
so
much
money

Then
he
told
*NL*
me
what
I
had
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
day
I
asked
the
terrible
Zingarelli
for
an
audience

His
old
*NL*
valet
ushered
me
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
What
do
you
want
of
me
,
you
naughty
boy
?

said
Zingarelli
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Maestro

'
I
said
,

I
repent
of
all
my
faults

I
will
never
go
out
of
*NL*
the
Conservatoire
by
passing
through
the
iron
grill
.
I
will
redouble
my
*NL*
diligence
.

*NL*
*NL*
''
`
If
I
were
not
frightened
of
spoiling
the
finest
bass
voice
I
have
*NL*
ever
heard
,
I
would
put
you
in
prison
for
a
fortnight
on
bread
and
*NL*
water

you
rascal

*NL*
*NL*

`

I
answered
,

will
be
the
model
boy
of
the
whole
school

but
I
would
ask
one
favour
of
you
.
If
anyone
comes
and
*NL*
asks
permission
for
me
to
sing
outside
,
refuse
.
As
a
favour

please
say

that
you

me
.

who
the
devil
do
you
think
is
going
to
ask
for
a

you

should
ever

the
*NL*
Conservatoire

Do
you
want
to
make
fun
of
me
?
Clear
out
!
Clear
out
!
'
he
*NL*
said
,
trying
to
give
me
a
kick
,
`
or
look
out
for
prison
and
dry
bread
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
astonished
Julien
.
The
solitary
weeks
passed
at
Verrieres
in
*NL*
de
Renal
's
house
had
been
a
period
of
happiness
for
him
.
He
had
only
*NL*
experienced
revulsions
and
sad
thoughts
at
the
dinners
to
which
he
had
*NL*
been
invited
.
And
was
he
not
able
to
read
,
write
and
reflect
,
without
*NL*
being
distracted
,
in
this
solitary
house
?
He
was
not
distracted
every
*NL*
moment
from
his
brilliant
reveries
by
the
cruel
necessity
of
studying
*NL*
the
movement
of
a
false
soul
in
order
to
deceive
it
by
intrigue
and
*NL*
hypocrisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
of
happiness
being
so
near
to
me
--
the
expense
of
a
life
*NL*
like
that
is
small
enough
.
I
could
have
my
choice
of
either
marrying
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Elisa
or
of
entering
into
partnership
with
Fouque
.
But
it
*NL*
is
only
the
traveller
who
has
just
scaled
a
steep
mountain
and
sits
*NL*
down
on
the
summit
who
finds
a
perfect
pleasure
in
resting
.
Would
he
be
*NL*
happy
if
he
had
to
rest
all
the
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
's
mind
had
now
reached
a
state
of
desperation
.
In
spite
*NL*
of
her
resolutions
,
she
had
explained
to
Julien
all
the
details
of
the
*NL*
auction
.
``
He
will
make
me
forget
all
my
oaths
!
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
have
sacrificed
her
life
without
hesitation
to
save
that
*NL*
of
her
husband
if
she
had
seen
him
in
danger
.
She
was
one
of
those
*NL*
noble
,
romantic
souls
who
find
a
source
of
perpetual
remorse
equal
to
*NL*
that
occasioned
by
the
actual
perpetration
of
a
crime
,
in
seeing
the
*NL*
possibility
of
a
generous
action
and
not
doing
it
.
None
the
less
,
there
*NL*
were
deadly
days
when
she
was
not
able
to
banish
the
imagination
of
*NL*
the
excessive
happiness
which
she
would
enjoy
if
she
suddenly
became
a
*NL*
widow
,
and
were
able
to
marry
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
loved
her
sons
much
more
than
their
father
did
;
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
strict
justice
they
were
devoted
to
him
.
She
quite
realised
that
if
*NL*
she
married
Julien
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
leave
that
Vergy
,
whose
*NL*
shades
were
so
dear
to
her
.
She
pictured
herself
living
at
Paris
,
and
*NL*
continuing
to
give
her
sons
an
education
which
would
make
them
admired
*NL*
by
everyone
.
Her
children
,
herself
,
and
Julien
!
They
would
be
all
*NL*
perfectly
happy
!
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
result
of
marriage
such
as
the
nineteenth
century
has
made
it
!
*NL*
The
boredom
of
matrimonial
life
makes
love
fade
away
inevitably
,
when
*NL*
love
has
preceded
the
marriage
.
But
none
the
less
,
said
a
philosopher
,
*NL*
married
life
soon
reduces
those
people
who
are
sufficiently
rich
*NL*
not
to
have
to
work
,
to
a
sense
of
being
utterly
bored
by
all
quiet
*NL*
enjoyments
.
And
among
women
,
it
is
only
arid
souls
whom
it
does
not
*NL*
predispose
to
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
philosopher
's
reflection
makes
me
excuse
Madame
de
Renal
,
but
she
*NL*
was
not
excused
in
Verrieres
,
and
without
her
suspecting
it
,
the
whole
*NL*
town
found
its
sole
topic
of
interest
in
the
scandal
of
her
intrigue
.
*NL*
As
a
result
of
this
great
affair
,
the
autumn
was
less
boring
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
autumn
and
part
of
the
winter
passed
very
quickly
.
It
was
necessary
*NL*
to
leave
the
woods
of
Vergy
.
Good
Verrieres
society
began
to
be
*NL*
indignant
at
the
fact
that
its
anathemas
made
so
little
impression
on
*NL*
Monsieur
de
Renal
.
Within
eight
days
,
several
serious
personages
who
*NL*
made
up
for
their
habitual
gravity
of
demeanour
by
their
pleasure
in
*NL*
fulfilling
missions
of
this
kind
,
gave
him
the
most
cruel
suspicions
,
*NL*
at
the
same
time
utilising
the
most
measured
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Valenod
,
who
was
playing
a
deep
game
,
had
placed
Elisa
in
an
*NL*
aristocratic
family
of
great
repute
,
where
there
were
five
women
.
*NL*
Elisa
,
fearing
,
so
she
said
,
not
to
find
a
place
during
the
winter
,
had
*NL*
only
asked
from
this
family
about
two-thirds
of
what
she
had
received
*NL*
in
the
house
of
the
mayor
.
The
girl
hit
upon
the
excellent
idea
of
*NL*
going
to
confession
at
the
same
time
to
both
the
old
cure
Chelan
,
*NL*
and
also
to
the
new
one
,
so
as
to
tell
both
of
them
in
detail
about
*NL*
Julien
's
amours
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
his
arrival
,
the
abbe
Chelan
summoned
Julien
to
him
at
*NL*
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
you
nothing
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
beg
you
,
and
if
needs
be
I
insist
,
*NL*
that
you
either
leave
for
the
Seminary
of
Besancon
,
or
for
your
friend
*NL*
Fouque
,
who
is
always
ready
to
provide
you
with
a
splendid
future
.
I
*NL*
have
seen
to
everything
and
have
arranged
everything
,
but
you
must
*NL*
leave
,
and
not
come
back
to
Verrieres
for
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
did
not
answer
.
He
was
considering
whether
his
honour
ought
to
*NL*
regard
itself
offended
at
the
trouble
which
Chelan
,
who
,
after
all
,
was
*NL*
not
his
father
,
had
taken
on
his
behalf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
the
honour
of
seeing
you
again
to-morrow
at
the
same
*NL*
hour
,
''
he
said
finally
to
the
cure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chelan
,
who
reckoned
on
carrying
so
young
a
man
by
storm
,
talked
a
*NL*
great
deal
.
Julien
,
cloaked
in
the
most
complete
humbleness
,
both
of
*NL*
demeanour
and
expression
,
did
not
open
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eventually
he
left
,
and
ran
to
warn
Madame
de
Renal
whom
he
found
in
*NL*
despair
.
Her
husband
had
just
spoken
to
her
with
a
certain
amount
of
*NL*
frankness
.
The
weakness
of
his
character
found
support
in
the
prospect
*NL*
of
the
legacy
,
and
had
decided
him
to
treat
her
as
perfectly
innocent
.
*NL*
He
had
just
confessed
to
her
the
strange
state
in
which
he
had
found
*NL*
public
opinion
in
Verrieres
.
The
public
was
wrong
;
it
had
been
misled
*NL*
by
jealous
tongues
.
But
,
after
all
,
what
was
one
to
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
,
for
the
moment
,
under
the
illusion
that
Julien
*NL*
would
accept
the
offer
of
Valenod
and
stay
at
Verrieres
.
But
she
was
no
*NL*
longer
the
simple
,
timid
woman
that
she
had
been
the
preceding
year
.
*NL*
Her
fatal
passion
and
remorse
had
enlightened
her
.
She
soon
realised
*NL*
the
painful
truth
-LRB-
while
at
the
same
time
she
listened
to
her
husband
-RRB-
,
*NL*
that
at
any
rate
a
temporary
separation
had
become
essential
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
is
far
from
me
,
Julien
will
revert
to
those
ambitious
projects
*NL*
which
are
so
natural
when
one
has
no
money
.
And
I
,
Great
God
!
I
am
so
*NL*
rich
,
and
my
riches
are
so
useless
for
my
happiness
.
He
will
forget
*NL*
me
.
Loveable
as
he
is
,
he
will
be
loved
,
and
he
will
love
.
You
unhappy
*NL*
woman
.
What
can
I
complain
of
?
Heaven
is
just
.
I
was
not
virtuous
*NL*
enough
to
leave
off
the
crime
.
Fate
robs
me
of
my
judgment
.
I
could
*NL*
easily
have
bribed
Elisa
if
I
had
wanted
to
;
nothing
was
easier
.
I
did
*NL*
not
take
the
trouble
to
reflect
for
a
moment
.
The
mad
imagination
of
*NL*
love
absorbed
all
my
time
.
I
am
ruined
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Julien
apprised
Madame
de
Renal
of
the
terrible
news
of
his
*NL*
departure
,
he
was
struck
with
one
thing
.
He
did
not
find
her
put
*NL*
forward
any
selfish
objections
.
She
was
evidently
making
efforts
not
to
*NL*
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
need
of
firmness
,
my
dear
.
''
She
cut
off
a
strand
of
her
hair
.
*NL*
``
I
do
no
know
what
I
shall
do
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
``
but
promise
me
if
I
*NL*
die
,
never
to
forget
my
children
.
Whether
you
are
far
or
near
,
try
to
*NL*
make
them
into
honest
men
.
If
there
is
a
new
revolution
,
all
the
nobles
*NL*
will
have
their
throats
cut
.
Their
father
will
probably
emigrate
,
*NL*
because
of
that
peasant
on
the
roof
who
got
killed
.
Watch
over
my
*NL*
family
.
Give
me
your
hand
.
Adieu
,
my
dear
.
These
are
our
last
moments
.
*NL*
Having
made
this
great
sacrifice
,
I
hope
I
shall
have
the
courage
to
*NL*
consider
my
reputation
in
public
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
been
expecting
despair
.
The
simplicity
of
this
farewell
*NL*
touched
him

*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
going
to
receive
your
farewell
like
this

I
will
leave
*NL*
you
now
,
as
you
yourself
wish
it

But
three
days
after
my
departure
I

will
come
back
to

you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
's
life
was
changed
.
So
Julien
really
loved
her
,
since
*NL*
of
his
own
accord
he
had
thought
of
seeing
her
again
.
Her
awful
grief
*NL*
became
changed
into
one
of
the
keenest
transports
of
joy
which
she
had
*NL*
felt
in
her
whole
life
.
Everything
became
easy
for
her
.
The
certainty
*NL*
of
seeing
her
lover
deprived
these
last
moments
of
their
poignancy
.
*NL*
From
that
moment
,
both
Madame
de
Renal
's
demeanour
and
the
expression
*NL*
of
her
face
were
noble
,
firm
,
and
perfectly
dignified
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
soon
came
back
.
He
was
beside
himself
.
He
eventually
*NL*
mentioned
to
his
wife
the
anonymous
letter
which
he
had
received
two
*NL*
months
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
it
to
the
Casino
,
and
shew
everybody
that
it
has
been
sent
*NL*
by
that
brute
Valenod
,
whom
I
took
out
of
the
gutter
and
made
into
one
*NL*
of
the
richest
tradesmen
in
Verrieres
.
I
will
disgrace
him
publicly
,
*NL*
and
then
I
will
fight
him
.
This
is
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
Heavens
!
I
may
become
a
widow
,
''
thought
Madame
de
Renal
,
and
*NL*
almost
at
the
same
time
she
said
to
herself
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
do
not
,
as
I
certainly
can
,
prevent
this
duel
,
I
shall
be
the
*NL*
murderess
of
my
own
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
never
expended
so
much
skill
in
honoring
his
vanity
.
Within
*NL*
two
hours
she
made
him
see
,
and
always
by
virtue
of
reasons
which
he
*NL*
discovered
himself
,
that
it
was
necessary
to
show
more
friendship
than
*NL*
ever
to
M.
Valenod
,
and
even
to
take
Elisa
back
into
the
household
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
had
need
of
courage
to
bring
herself
to
see
again
the
*NL*
girl
who
was
the
cause
of
her
unhappiness
.
But
this
idea
was
one
of
*NL*
Julien
's
.
Finally
,
having
been
put
on
the
track
three
or
four
times
,
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
arrived
spontaneously
at
the
conclusion
,
disagreeable
*NL*
though
it
was
from
the
financial
standpoint
,
that
the
most
painful
*NL*
thing
that
could
happen
to
him
would
be
that
Julien
,
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
effervescence
of
popular
gossip
throughout
Verrieres
,
should
stay
*NL*
in
the
town
as
the
tutor
of
Valenod
's
children
.
It
was
obviously
to
*NL*
Julien
's
interest
to
accept
the
offer
of
the
director
of
the
workhouse
.
*NL*
Conversely
,
it
was
essential
for
M.
de
Renal
's
prestige
that
Julien
*NL*
should
leave
Verrieres
to
enter
the
seminary
of
Besancon
or
that
of
*NL*
Dijon
.
But
how
to
make
him
decide
on
that
course
?
And
then
how
is
he
*NL*
going
to
live
?
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
,
seeing
a
monetary
sacrifice
looming
in
the
distance
,
*NL*
was
in
deeper
despair
than
his
wife
.
As
for
her
,
she
felt
after
this
*NL*
interview
in
the
position
of
a
man
of
spirit
who
,
tired
of
life
,
has
*NL*
taken
a
dose
of
stramonium
.
He
only
acts
mechanically
so
to
speak
,
and
*NL*
takes
no
longer
any
interest
in
anything
.
In
this
way
,
Louis
XIV
.
came
*NL*
to
say
on
his
death-bed
,
``
When
I
was
king
.
''
An
admirable
epigram
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
M.
de
Renal
received
quite
early
an
anonymous
letter
.
*NL*
It
was
written
in
a
most
insulting
style
,
and
the
coarsest
words
*NL*
applicable
to
his
position
occurred
on
every
line
.
It
was
the
work
of
*NL*
some
jealous
subordinate
.
This
letter
made
him
think
again
of
fighting
*NL*
a
duel
with
Valenod
.
Soon
his
courage
went
as
far
as
the
idea
of
*NL*
immediate
action
.
He
left
the
house
alone
,
went
to
the
armourer
's
and
*NL*
got
some
pistols
which
he
loaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
even
though
the
strict
*NL*
administration
of
the
Emperor
Napoleon
were
to
become
fashionable
*NL*
again
,
I
should
not
have
one
sou
's
worth
of
jobbery
to
reproach
myself
*NL*
with
;
at
the
outside
,
I
have
shut
my
eyes
,
and
I
have
some
good
letters
*NL*
in
my
desk
which
authorise
me
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
terrified
by
her
husband
's
cold
anger
.
It
recalled
*NL*
to
her
the
fatal
idea
of
widowhood
which
she
had
so
much
trouble
in
*NL*
repelling
.
She
closeted
herself
with
him
.
For
several
hours
she
talked
*NL*
to
him
in
vain
.
The
new
anonymous
letter
had
decided
him
.
Finally
she
*NL*
succeeded
in
transforming
the
courage
which
had
decided
him
to
box
*NL*
Valenod
's
ears
,
into
the
courage
of
offering
six
hundred
francs
to
*NL*
Julien
,
which
would
keep
him
for
one
year
in
a
seminary
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
cursed
a
thousand
times
the
day
that
he
had
had
the
*NL*
ill-starred
idea
of
taking
a
tutor
into
his
house
,
and
forgot
the
*NL*
anonymous
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
consoled
himself
a
little
by
an
idea
which
he
did
not
tell
his
*NL*
wife
.
With
the
exercise
of
some
skill
,
and
by
exploiting
the
romantic
*NL*
ideas
of
the
young
man
,
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
induce
him
to
refuse
M.
*NL*
Valenod
's
offer
at
a
cheaper
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
had
much
more
trouble
in
proving
to
Julien
that
*NL*
inasmuch
as
he
was
sacrificing
the
post
of
six
hundred
francs
a
year
*NL*
in
order
to
enable
her
husband
to
keep
up
appearances
,
he
need
have
no
*NL*
shame
about
accepting
the
compensation
.
But
Julien
would
say
each
time
,
*NL*
``
I
have
never
thought
for
a
moment
of
accepting
that
offer
.
You
have
*NL*
made
me
so
used
to
a
refined
life
that
the
coarseness
of
those
people
*NL*
would
kill
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cruel
necessity
bent
Julien
's
will
with
its
iron
hand
.
His
pride
gave
*NL*
him
the
illusion
that
he
only
accepted
the
sum
offered
by
M.
de
Renal
*NL*
as
a
loan
,
and
induced
him
to
give
him
a
promissory
note
,
repayable
in
*NL*
five
years
with
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
had
,
of
course
,
many
thousands
of
francs
which
had
been
*NL*
concealed
in
the
little
mountain
cave
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
offered
them
to
him
all
a
tremble
,
feeling
only
too
keenly
that
*NL*
they
would
be
angrily
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
,
''
said
Julien
to
her
,
``
to
make
the
memory
of
our
love
*NL*
loathsome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
Julien
left
Verrieres
.
M.
de
Renal
was
very
happy
,
but
when
*NL*
the
fatal
moment
came
to
accept
money
from
him
the
sacrifice
proved
*NL*
beyond
Julien
's
strength
.
He
refused
point
blank
.
M.
de
Renal
embraced
*NL*
him
around
the
neck
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
Julien
had
asked
him
for
*NL*
a
testimonial
of
good
conduct
,
and
his
enthusiasm
could
find
no
terms
*NL*
magnificent
enough
in
which
to
extol
his
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
hero
had
five
louis
of
savings
and
he
reckoned
on
asking
Fouque
for
*NL*
an
equal
sum
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
moved
.
But
one
league
from
Verrieres
,
where
he
left
so
much
*NL*
that
was
dear
to
him
,
he
only
thought
of
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
*NL*
capital
of
a
great
military
town
like
Besancon
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
short
absence
of
three
days
,
Madame
de
Renal
was
the
victim
*NL*
of
one
of
the
cruellest
deceptions
to
which
love
is
liable
.
Her
life
*NL*
was
tolerable
,
because
between
her
and
extreme
unhappiness
there
was
*NL*
still
that
last
interview
which
she
was
to
have
with
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
during
the
night
of
the
third
day
,
she
heard
from
a
distance
*NL*
the
preconcerted
signal
.
Julien
,
having
passed
through
a
thousand
*NL*
dangers
,
appeared
before
her
.
In
this
moment
she
only
had
one
*NL*
thought
--
``
I
see
him
for
the
last
time
.
''
Instead
of
answering
the
*NL*
endearments
of
her
lover
,
she
seemed
more
dead
than
alive
.
If
she
*NL*
forced
herself
to
tell
him
that
she
loved
him
,
she
said
it
with
an
*NL*
embarrassed
air
which
almost
proved
the
contrary
.
Nothing
could
rid
her
*NL*
of
the
cruel
idea
of
eternal
separation
.
The
suspicious
Julien
thought
*NL*
for
the
moment
that
he
was
already
forgotten
.
His
pointed
remarks
to
*NL*
this
effect
were
only
answered
by
great
tears
which
flowed
down
in
*NL*
silence
,
and
by
some
hysterical
pressings
of
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
Julien
would
answer
his
mistress
's
cold
protestations
,
``
Great
*NL*
Heavens
!
How
can
you
expect
me
to
believe
you
?
You
would
show
one
*NL*
hundred
times
more
sincere
affection
to
Madame
Derville
to
a
mere
*NL*
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
petrified
,
and
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
to
be
more
unhappy
.
I
hope
I
am
going
to
die
.
I
feel
*NL*
my
heart
turn
to
ice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Those
were
the
longest
answers
which
he
could
obtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
approach
of
day
rendered
it
necessary
for
him
to
leave
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
,
her
tears
completely
ceased
.
She
saw
him
tie
a
knotted
rope
*NL*
to
the
window
without
saying
a
word
,
and
without
returning
her
kisses
.
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
Julien
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
now
we
have
reached
the
state
of
affairs
which
you
wished
for
*NL*
so
much
.
Henceforward
you
will
live
without
remorse
.
The
slightest
*NL*
indisposition
of
your
children
will
no
longer
make
you
see
them
in
the
*NL*
tomb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
that
you
can
not
kiss
Stanislas
,
''
she
said
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
finished
by
being
profoundly
impressed
by
the
cold
embraces
of
*NL*
this
living
corpse
.
He
could
think
of
nothing
else
for
several
leagues
.
*NL*
His
soul
was
overwhelmed
,
and
before
passing
the
mountain
,
and
while
*NL*
he
could
still
see
the
church
tower
of
Verrieres
he
turned
round
*NL*
frequently
.

Finally
he
saw
some
black
walls
near
a
distant
mountain
.
It
was
the
*NL*
citadel
of
Besancon
.
``
How
different
it
would
be
for
me
,
''
he
said
*NL*
with
a
sigh
,
``
if
I
were
arriving
at
this
noble
military
town
to
be
*NL*
sub-lieutenant
in
one
of
the
regiments
entrusted
with
its
defence
.
''
*NL*
Besancon
is
not
only
one
of
the
prettiest
towns
in
France
,
it
abounds
*NL*
in
people
of
spirit
and
brains
.
But
Julien
was
only
a
little
peasant
,
*NL*
and
had
no
means
of
approaching
distinguished
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
taken
a
civilian
suit
at
Fouque
's
,
and
it
was
in
this
dress
that
*NL*
he
passed
the
drawbridge
.
Steeped
as
he
was
in
the
history
of
the
siege
*NL*
of
1674
,
he
wished
to
see
the
ramparts
of
the
citadel
before
shutting
*NL*
himself
up
in
the
seminary
.
He
was
within
an
ace
two
or
three
times
*NL*
of
getting
himself
arrested
by
the
sentinel
.
He
was
penetrating
into
*NL*
places
which
military
genius
forbids
the
public
to
enter
,
in
order
to
*NL*
sell
twelve
or
fifteen
francs
worth
of
corn
every
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
height
of
the
walls
,
the
depth
of
the
ditches
,
the
terrible
aspect
*NL*
of
the
cannons
had
been
engrossing
him
for
several
hours
when
he
passed
*NL*
before
the
great
cafe
on
the
boulevard
.
He
was
motionless
with
wonder
;
*NL*
it
was
in
vain
that
he
read
the
word
_
cafe
_
,
written
in
big
characters
*NL*
above
the
two
immense
doors
.
He
could
not
believe
his
eyes
.
He
made
an
*NL*
effort
to
overcome
his
timidity
.
He
dared
to
enter
,
and
found
himself
*NL*
in
a
hall
twenty
or
thirty
yards
long
,
and
with
a
ceiling
at
least
*NL*
twenty
feet
high
.
To-day
,
everything
had
a
fascination
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
games
of
billiards
were
in
progress
.
The
waiters
were
crying
out
*NL*
the
scores
.
The
players
ran
round
the
tables
encumbered
by
spectators
.
*NL*
Clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
came
from
everybody
's
mouth
,
and
enveloped
them
*NL*
in
a
blue
haze
.
The
high
stature
of
these
men
,
their
rounded
shoulders
,
*NL*
their
heavy
gait
,
their
enormous
whiskers
,
the
long
tailed
coats
which
*NL*
covered
them
,
everything
combined
to
attract
Julien
's
attention
.
These
*NL*
noble
children
of
the
antique
Bisontium
only
spoke
at
the
top
of
their
*NL*
voice
.
They
gave
themselves
terrible
martial
airs
.
Julien
stood
still
*NL*
and
admired
them
.
He
kept
thinking
of
the
immensity
and
magnificence
*NL*
of
a
great
capital
like
Besancon
.
He
felt
absolutely
devoid
of
the
*NL*
requisite
courage
to
ask
one
of
those
haughty
looking
gentlemen
,
who
*NL*
were
crying
out
the
billiard
scores
,
for
a
cup
of
coffee
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
young
lady
at
the
bar
had
noticed
the
charming
face
of
this
*NL*
young
civilian
from
the
country
,
who
had
stopped
three
feet
from
*NL*
the
stove
with
his
little
parcel
under
his
arm
,
and
was
looking
at
*NL*
the
fine
white
plaster
bust
of
the
king
.
This
young
lady
,
a
big
*NL*
_
Franc-comtoise
_
,
very
well
made
,
and
dressed
with
the
elegance
*NL*
suitable
to
the
prestige
of
the
cafe
,
had
already
said
two
or
three
*NL*
times
in
a
little
voice
not
intended
to
be
heard
by
any
one
except
*NL*
Julien
,
``
Monsieur
,
Monsieur
.
''
Julien
's
eyes
encountered
big
blue
eyes
*NL*
full
of
tenderness
,
and
saw
that
he
was
the
person
who
was
being
spoken
*NL*
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sharply
approached
the
bar
and
the
pretty
girl
,
as
though
he
had
*NL*
been
marching
towards
the
enemy
.
In
this
great
manoeuvre
the
parcel
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
pity
will
not
our
provincial
inspire
in
the
young
lycee
scholars
*NL*
of
Paris
,
who
,
at
the
early
age
of
fifteen
,
know
already
how
to
enter
*NL*
a
cafe
with
so
distinguished
an
air
?
But
these
children
who
have
such
*NL*
style
at
fifteen
turn
commonplace
at
eighteen
.
The
impassioned
timidity
*NL*
which
is
met
with
in
the
provinces
,
sometimes
manages
to
master
its
own
*NL*
nervousness
,
and
thus
trains
the
will
.
``
I
must
tell
her
the
truth
,
''
*NL*
thought
Julien
,
who
was
becoming
courageous
by
dint
of
conquering
his
*NL*
timidity
as
he
approached
this
pretty
girl
,
who
deigned
to
address
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
this
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
I
have
come
to
*NL*
Besancon
.
I
should
like
to
have
some
bread
and
a
cup
of
coffee
in
*NL*
return
for
payment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
smiled
a
little
,
and
then
blushed
.
She
feared
the
ironic
*NL*
attention
and
the
jests
of
the
billiard
players
might
be
turned
against
*NL*
this
pretty
young
man
.
He
would
be
frightened
and
would
not
appear
*NL*
there
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
here
near
me
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
showing
him
a
marble
table
almost
*NL*
completely
hidden
by
the
enormous
mahogany
counter
which
extended
into
*NL*
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
leant
over
the
counter
,
and
had
thus
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
displaying
a
superb
figure
.
Julien
noticed
it
.
All
his
ideas
changed
.
*NL*
The
pretty
young
lady
had
just
placed
before
him
a
cup
,
some
sugar
,
and
*NL*
a
little
roll
.
She
hesitated
to
call
a
waiter
for
the
coffee
,
as
she
*NL*
realised
that
his
arrival
would
put
an
end
to
her
_
tete-a-tete
_
with
*NL*
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
pensively
comparing
this
blonde
and
merry
beauty
with
*NL*
certain
memories
which
would
often
thrill
him
.
The
thought
of
the
*NL*
passion
of
which
he
had
been
the
object
,
nearly
freed
him
from
all
*NL*
his
timidity
.
The
pretty
young
woman
had
only
one
moment
to
save
the
*NL*
situation
.
She
read
it
in
Julien
's
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
pipe
smoke
makes
you
cough
;
come
and
have
breakfast
to-morrow
*NL*
before
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
I
am
practically
alone
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
said
Julien
,
with
the
caressing
smile
of
happy
*NL*
timidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amanda
Binet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
allow
me
to
send
you
within
an
hour
's
time
a
little
parcel
*NL*
about
as
big
as
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
beautiful
Amanda
reflected
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
watched
.
What
you
ask
may
compromise
me
.
All
the
same
,
I
will
*NL*
write
my
address
on
a
card
,
which
you
will
put
on
your
parcel
.
Send
it
*NL*
boldly
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Julien
Sorel
,
''
said
the
young
man
.
``
I
have
neither
*NL*
relatives
nor
acquaintances
at
Besancon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
understand
,
''
she
said
joyfully
.
``
You
come
to
study
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
no
,
''
answered
Julien
,
``
I
am
being
sent
to
the
Seminary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
complete
discouragement
damped
Amanda
's
features
.
She
called
*NL*
a
waiter
.
She
had
courage
now
.
The
waiter
poured
out
some
coffee
for
*NL*
Julien
without
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amanda
was
receiving
money
at
the
counter
.
Julien
was
proud
of
having
*NL*
dared
to
speak
:
a
dispute
was
going
on
at
one
of
the
billiard
tables
.
*NL*
The
cries
and
the
protests
of
the
players
resounded
over
the
immense
*NL*
hall
,
and
made
a
din
which
astonished
Julien
.
Amanda
was
dreamy
,
and
*NL*
kept
her
eyes
lowered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
like
,
Mademoiselle
,
''
he
said
to
her
suddenly
with
assurance
,
``
I
*NL*
will
say
that
I
am
your
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
air
of
authority
pleased
Amanda
.
``
He
's
not
a
mere
nobody
,
''
*NL*
she
thought
.
She
spoke
to
him
very
quickly
,
without
looking
at
him
,
*NL*
because
her
eye
was
occupied
in
seeing
if
anybody
was
coming
near
the
*NL*
counter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
from
Genlis
,
near
Dijon
.
Say
that
you
are
also
from
Genlis
and
*NL*
are
my
mother
's
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
fail
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
gentlemen
who
go
to
the
Seminary
pass
here
before
the
cafe
*NL*
every
Thursday
in
the
summer
at
five
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
think
of
me
when
I
am
passing
,
have
a
bunch
of
violets
in
your
*NL*
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amanda
looked
at
him
with
an
astonished
air
.
This
look
changed
Julien
's
*NL*
courage
into
audacity
.
Nevertheless
,
he
reddened
considerably
,
as
he
*NL*
said
to
her
.
``
I
feel
that
I
love
you
with
the
most
violent
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
in
lower
tones
,
''
she
said
to
him
with
a
frightened
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
trying
to
recollect
phrases
out
of
a
volume
of
the
_
Nouvelle
*NL*
Heloise
_
which
he
had
found
at
Vergy
.
His
memory
served
him
in
good
*NL*
stead
.
For
ten
minutes
he
recited
the
_
Nouvelle
Heloise
_
to
the
*NL*
delighted
Mademoiselle
Amanda
.
He
was
happy
on
the
strength
of
his
own
*NL*
bravery
,
when
suddenly
the
beautiful
Franc-contoise
assumed
an
icy
*NL*
air
.
One
of
her
lovers
had
appeared
at
the
cafe
door
.
He
approached
*NL*
the
bar
,
whistling
,
and
swaggering
his
shoulders
.
He
looked
at
Julien
.
*NL*
The
latter
's
imagination
,
which
always
indulged
in
extremes
,
suddenly
*NL*
brimmed
over
with
ideas
of
a
duel
.
He
paled
greatly
,
put
down
his
*NL*
cup
,
assumed
an
assured
demeanour
,
and
considered
his
rival
very
*NL*
attentively
.
As
this
rival
lowered
his
head
,
while
he
familiarly
poured
*NL*
out
on
the
counter
a
glass
of
brandy
for
himself
,
Amanda
ordered
Julien
*NL*
with
a
look
to
lower
his
eyes
.
He
obeyed
,
and
for
two
minutes
kept
*NL*
motionless
in
his
place
,
pale
,
resolute
,
and
only
thinking
of
what
was
*NL*
going
to
happen
.
He
was
truly
happy
at
this
moment
.
The
rival
had
been
*NL*
astonished
by
Julien
's
eyes
.
Gulping
down
his
glass
of
brandy
,
he
said
*NL*
a
few
words
to
Amanda
,
placed
his
two
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
big
*NL*
tail
coat
,
and
approached
the
billiard
table
,
whistling
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
Julien
.
The
latter
got
up
transported
with
rage
,
but
he
did
not
know
*NL*
what
to
do
in
order
to
be
offensive
.
He
put
down
his
little
parcel
,
and
*NL*
walked
towards
the
billiard
table
with
all
the
swagger
he
could
muster
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
prudence
said
to
him
,
``
but
your
ecclesiastical
*NL*
career
will
be
ruined
by
a
duel
immediately
on
top
of
your
arrival
at
*NL*
Besancon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
matter
.
It
shall
never
be
said
that
I
let
an
insolent
*NL*
fellow
go
scot
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amanda
saw
his
courage
.
It
contrasted
prettily
with
the
simplicity
of
*NL*
his
manners
.
She
instantly
preferred
him
to
the
big
young
man
with
the
*NL*
tail
coat
.
She
got
up
,
and
while
appearing
to
be
following
with
her
eye
*NL*
somebody
who
was
passing
in
the
street
,
she
went
and
quickly
placed
*NL*
herself
between
him
and
the
billiard
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
not
to
look
askance
at
that
gentleman
.
He
is
my
*NL*
brother-in-law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
matter
?
He
looked
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
make
me
unhappy
?
No
doubt
he
looked
at
you
,
why
it
may
*NL*
be
he
is
going
to
speak
to
you
.
I
told
him
that
you
were
a
relative
of
*NL*
my
mother
,
and
that
you
had
arrived
from
Genlis
.
He
is
a
Franc-contois
,
*NL*
and
has
never
gone
beyond
Doleon
the
Burgundy
Road
,
so
say
what
you
*NL*
like
and
fear
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
still
hesitating
.
Her
barmaid
's
imagination
furnished
her
*NL*
with
an
abundance
of
lies
,
and
she
quickly
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
he
looked
at
you
,
but
it
was
at
a
moment
when
he
was
asking
*NL*
me
who
you
were
.
He
is
a
man
who
is
boorish
with
everyone
.
He
did
not
*NL*
mean
to
insult
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
eye
followed
the
pretended
brother-in-law
.
He
saw
him
buy
a
*NL*
ticket
for
the
pool
,
which
they
were
playing
at
the
further
of
the
*NL*
two
billiard
tables
.
Julien
heard
his
loud
voice
shouting
out
in
a
*NL*
threatening
tone
,
``
My
turn
to
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
sharply
before
Madame
Amanda
,
and
took
a
step
towards
the
*NL*
billiard
table
.
Amanda
seized
him
by
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
pay
me
first
,
''
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
right
,
''
thought
Julien
.
``
She
is
frightened
that
I
shall
leave
*NL*
without
paying
.
''
Amanda
was
as
agitated
as
he
was
,
and
very
red
.
She
*NL*
gave
him
the
change
as
slowly
as
she
could
,
while
she
repeated
to
him
,
*NL*
in
a
low
voice
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
the
cafe
this
instant
,
or
I
shall
love
you
no
more
,
and
yet
I
do
*NL*
love
you
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
did
go
out
,
but
slowly
.
``
Am
I
not
in
duty
bound
,
''
he
repeated
*NL*
to
himself
,
``
to
go
and
stare
at
that
coarse
person
in
my
turn
?
''
This
*NL*
uncertainty
kept
him
on
the
boulevard
in
the
front
of
the
cafe
for
an
*NL*
hour
;
he
kept
looking
if
his
man
was
coming
out
.
He
did
not
come
out
,
*NL*
and
Julien
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
only
been
at
Besancon
some
hours
,
and
already
he
had
overcome
*NL*
one
pang
of
remorse
.
The
old
surgeon-major
had
formerly
given
him
some
*NL*
fencing
lessons
,
in
spite
of
his
gout
.
That
was
all
the
science
which
*NL*
Julien
could
enlist
in
the
service
of
his
anger
.
But
this
embarrassment
*NL*
would
have
been
nothing
if
he
had
only
known
how
to
vent
his
temper
*NL*
otherwise
than
by
the
giving
of
a
blow
,
for
if
it
had
come
to
a
matter
*NL*
of
fisticuffs
,
his
enormous
rival
would
have
beaten
him
and
then
*NL*
cleared
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
not
much
difference
between
a
seminary
and
a
prison
,
''
said
*NL*
Julien
to
himself
,
``
for
a
poor
devil
like
me
,
without
protectors
and
*NL*
without
money
.
I
must
leave
my
civilian
clothes
in
some
inn
,
where
I
*NL*
can
put
my
black
suit
on
again
.
If
I
ever
manage
to
get
out
of
the
*NL*
seminary
for
a
few
hours
,
I
shall
be
able
to
see
Mdlle
.
Amanda
again
in
*NL*
my
lay
clothes
.
''
This
reasoning
was
all
very
fine
.
Though
Julien
passed
*NL*
in
front
of
all
the
inns
,
he
did
not
dare
to
enter
a
single
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
as
he
was
passing
again
before
the
Hotel
des
Ambassadeurs
,
his
*NL*
anxious
eyes
encountered
those
of
a
big
woman
,
still
fairly
young
,
with
*NL*
a
high
colour
,
and
a
gay
and
happy
air
.
He
approached
her
and
told
his
*NL*
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
my
pretty
little
abbe
,
''
said
the
hostess
of
the
*NL*
Ambassadeurs
to
him
,
``
I
will
keep
your
lay
clothes
for
you
,
and
I
will
*NL*
even
have
them
regularly
brushed
.
In
weather
like
this
,
it
is
not
good
*NL*
to
leave
a
suit
of
cloth
without
touching
it
.
''
She
took
a
key
,
and
*NL*
conducted
him
herself
to
a
room
,
and
advised
him
to
make
out
a
note
of
*NL*
what
he
was
leaving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
.
How
well
you
look
like
that
,
M.
the
abbe
Sorel
,
''
said
*NL*
the
big
woman
to
him
when
he
came
down
to
the
kitchen
.
I
will
go
and
*NL*
get
a
good
dinner
served
up
to
you
,
and
she
added
in
a
low
voice
,
``
It
*NL*
will
only
cost
twenty
sous
instead
of
the
fifty
which
everybody
else
*NL*
pays
,
for
one
must
really
take
care
of
your
little
purse
strings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
ten
louis
,
''
Julien
replied
with
certain
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
great
heavens
,
''
answered
the
good
hostess
in
alarm
.
``
Do
n't
talk
*NL*
so
loud
,
there
are
quite
a
lot
of
bad
characters
in
Besancon
.
They
'll
*NL*
steal
all
that
from
you
in
less
than
no
time
,
and
above
all
,
never
go
*NL*
into
the
cafe
s
,
they
are
filled
with
bad
characters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
said
Julien
,
to
whom
those
words
gave
food
for
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
anywhere
else
,
except
to
my
place
.
I
will
make
coffee
for
*NL*
you
.
Remember
that
you
will
always
find
a
friend
here
,
and
a
good
*NL*
dinner
for
twenty
sous
.
So
now
you
understand
,

hope

Go
and
sit
down
*NL*
at
table

I
will
serve
you
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
be
able
to
eat
,
''
said
Julien
to
her
.
``
I
am
too
upset
.
I
am
*NL*
going
to
enter
the
seminary
,
as
I
leave
you
.
''
The
good
woman
,
would
not
*NL*
allow
him
to
leave
before
she
had
filled
his
pockets
with
provisions
.
*NL*
Finally
Julien
took
his
road
towards
the
terrible
place
.
The
hostess
*NL*
was
standing
at
the
threshold
,
and
showed
him
the
way
.

and

and

Valenod
of
*NL*
Besancon
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
in
the
distance
the
iron
gilt
cross
on
the
door
.
He
approached
*NL*
slowly
.
His
legs
seemed
to
give
way
beneath
him
.
``
So
here
is
this
hell
*NL*
upon
earth
which
I
shall
be
unable
to
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
he
made
up
his
mind
to
ring
.
The
noise
of
the
bell
reverberated
*NL*
as
though
through
a
solitude
.
At
the
end
of
ten
minutes
a
pale
man
,
*NL*
clothed
in
black
,
came
and
opened
the
door
.
Julien
looked
at
him
,
and
*NL*
immediately
lowered
his
eyes
.
This
porter
had
a
singular
physiognomy
.
*NL*
The
green
projecting
pupils
of
his
eyes
were
as
round
as
those
of
a
*NL*
cat
.
The
straight
lines
of
his
eyebrows
betokened
the
impossibility
of
*NL*
any
sympathy
.
His
thin
lips
came
round
in
a
semicircle
over
projecting
*NL*
teeth
.
None
the
less
,
his
physiognomy
did
not
so
much
betoken
crime
*NL*
as
rather
that
perfect
callousness
which
is
so
much
more
terrifying
*NL*
to
the
young
.
The
one
sentiment
which
Julien
's
rapid
gaze
surmised
in
*NL*
this
long
and
devout
face
was
a
profound
contempt
for
every
topic
of
*NL*
conversation
which
did
not
deal
with
things
celestial
.
Julien
raised
*NL*
his
eyes
with
an
effort
,
and
in
a
voice
rendered
quavering
by
the
*NL*
beating
of
his
heart
explained
that
he
desired
to
speak
to
M.
Pirard
,
*NL*
the
director
of
the
Seminary
.
Without
saying
a
word
the
man
in
black
*NL*
signed
to
him
to
follow
.
They
ascended
two
stories
by
a
large
staircase
*NL*
with
a
wooden
rail
,
whose
warped
stairs
inclined
to
the
side
opposite
*NL*
the
wall
,
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
falling
.
A
little
door
with
a
*NL*
big
cemetery
cross
of
white
wood
painted
black
at
the
top
was
opened
*NL*
with
difficulty
,
and
the
porter
made
him
enter
a
dark
low
room
,
whose
*NL*
whitewashed
walls
were
decorated
with
two
big
pictures
blackened
by
*NL*
age
.
In
this
room
Julien
was
left
alone
.
He
was
overwhelmed
.
His
heart
*NL*
was
beating
violently
.
He
would
have
been
happy
to
have
ventured
to
*NL*
cry
.
A
silence
of
death
reigned
over
the
whole
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
which
seemed
a
whole
day
to
him
,
*NL*
the
sinister
looking
porter
reappeared
on
the
threshold
of
a
door
at
*NL*
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
without
vouchsafing
a
word
,
signed
to
*NL*
him
to
advance
.
He
entered
into
a
room
even
larger
than
the
first
,
*NL*
and
very
badly
lighted
.
The
walls
also
were
whitened
,
but
there
was
*NL*
no
furniture
.
Only
in
a
corner
near
the
door
Julien
saw
as
he
passed
*NL*
a
white
wooden
bed
,
two
straw
chairs
,
and
a
little
pinewood
armchair
*NL*
without
any
cushions
.
He
perceived
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
near
a
*NL*
small
window
with
yellow
panes
decorated
with
badly
kept
flower
vases
,
*NL*
a
man
seated
at
a
table
,
and
covered
with
a
dilapidated
cassock
.
He
*NL*
appeared
to
be
in
a
temper
,
and
took
one
after
the
other
a
number
of
*NL*
little
squares
of
paper
,
which
he
arranged
on
his
table
after
he
had
*NL*
written
some
words
on
them
.
He
did
not
notice
Julien
's
presence
.
The
*NL*
latter
did
not
move
,
but
kept
standing
near
the
centre
of
the
room
in
*NL*
the
place
where
the
porter
,
who
had
gone
out
and
shut
the
door
,
had
*NL*
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
minutes
passed
in
this
way
:
the
badly
dressed
man
kept
on
writing
*NL*
all
the
time
.
Julien
's
emotion
and
terror
were
so
great
that
he
thought
*NL*
he
was
on
the
point
of
falling
.
A
philosopher
would
have
said
,
possibly
*NL*
wrongly
,
``
It
is
a
violent
impression
made
by
ugliness
on
a
soul
*NL*
intended
by
nature
to
love
the
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
was
writing
lifted
up
his
head
.
Julien
only
perceived
it
*NL*
after
a
moment
had
passed
,
and
even
after
seeing
it
,
he
still
remained
*NL*
motionless
,
as
though
struck
dead
by
the
terrible
look
of
which
he
*NL*
was
the
victim
.
Julien
's
troubled
eyes
just
managed
to
make
out
a
*NL*
long
face
,
all
covered
with
red
blotches
except
the
forehead
,
which
*NL*
manifested
a
mortal
pallor
.
Two
little
black
eyes
,
calculated
to
*NL*
terrify
the
most
courageous
,
shone
between
these
red
cheeks
and
that
*NL*
white
forehead
.
The
vast
area
of
his
forehead
was
bounded
by
thick
,
*NL*
flat
,
jet
black
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
come
near
,
yes
or
no
?
''
said
the
man
at
last
,
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
advanced
with
an
uneasy
step
,
and
at
last
,
paler
than
he
had
*NL*
ever
been
in
his
life
and
on
the
point
of
falling
,
stopped
three
paces
*NL*
from
the
little
white
wooden
table
which
was
covered
with
the
squares
*NL*
of
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearer
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
advanced
still
further
,
holding
out
his
hand
,
as
though
trying
*NL*
to
lean
on
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Julien
Sorel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
certainly
very
late
,
''
said
the
man
to
him
,
as
he
rivetted
*NL*
again
on
him
that
terrible
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
could
not
endure
this
look
.
Holding
out
his
hand
as
though
to
*NL*
support
himself
,
he
fell
all
his
length
along
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
rang
.
Julien
had
only
lost
the
use
of
his
eyes
and
the
power
of
*NL*
movement
.
He
heard
steps
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
lifted
up
and
placed
on
the
little
armchair
of
white
wood
.
He
*NL*
heard
the
terrible
man
saying
to
the
porter
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
had
an
epileptic
fit
apparently
,
and
this
is
the
finishing
*NL*
touch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Julien
was
able
to
open
his
eyes
,
the
man
with
the
red
face
was
*NL*
going
on
with
his
writing
.
The
porter
had
disappeared
.
``
I
must
have
*NL*
courage
,
''
said
our
hero
to
himself
,
``
and
above
all
,
hide
what
I
feel
.
''
*NL*
He
felt
violently
sick
.
``
If
anything
happens
to
me
,
God
knows
what
they
*NL*
will
think
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
the
man
stopped
writing
and
looked
sideways
at
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
in
a
fit
state
to
answer
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
Julien
in
an
enfeebled
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
fortunate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
black
had
half
got
up
,
and
was
looking
impatiently
for
a
*NL*
letter
in
the
drawer
of
his
pinewood
table
,
which
opened
with
a
grind
.
*NL*
He
found
it
,
sat
down
slowly
,
and
looking
again
at
Julien
in
a
manner
*NL*
calculated
to
suck
out
of
him
the
little
life
which
he
still
possessed
,
*NL*
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
recommended
to
me
by
M.
Chelan
.
He
was
the
best
cure
in
*NL*
the
diocese
;
he
was
an
upright
man
if
there
ever
was
one
,
and
my
friend
*NL*
for
thirty
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
.
It
's
to
M.
Pirard
then
that
I
have
the
honour
of
speaking
?
''
said
*NL*
Julien
in
a
dying
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apparently
,
''
replied
the
director
of
the
seminary
,
as
he
looked
at
him
*NL*
disagreeably
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
glitter
of
his
little
eyes
doubled
and
was
followed
by
an
*NL*
involuntary
movement
of
the
muscles
of
the
corner
of
the
mouth
.
It
*NL*
was
the
physiognomy
of
the
tiger
savouring
in
advance
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
devouring
its
prey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chelan
's
letter
is
short
,
''
he
said
,
as
though
speaking
to
himself
.
*NL*
''
_
Intelligenti
pauca
_
.
In
the
present
time
it
is
impossible
to
write
*NL*
too
little
.
''
He
read
aloud
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
recommend
to
you
Julien
Sorel
of
this
parish
,
whom
*NL*
I
baptized
nearly
twenty
years
ago
,
the
son
of
a
rich
*NL*
carpenter
who
gives
him
nothing
.
Julien
will
be
a
*NL*
remarkable
worker
in
the
vineyard
of
the
Lord
.
He
lacks
*NL*
neither
memory
nor
intelligence
;
he
has
some
faculty
*NL*
for
reflection
.
Will
he
persevere
in
his
calling
?
Is
he
*NL*
sincere
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sincere
,
''
repeated
the
abbe
Pirard
with
an
astonished
air
,
looking
at
*NL*
Julien
.
But
the
abbe
's
look
was
already
less
devoid
of
all
humanity
.
*NL*
``
Sincere
,
''
he
repeated
,
lowering
his
voice
,
and
resuming
his
reading
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
you
for
a
stipend
for
Julien
Sorel
.
He
will
earn
*NL*
it
by
passing
the
necessary
examinations
.
I
have
taught
*NL*
him
a
little
theology
,
that
old
and
good
theology
of
the
*NL*
Bossuets
,
the
Arnaults
,
and
the
Fleury
's
.
If
the
person
*NL*
does
not
suit
you
,
send
him
back
to
me
.
The
director
*NL*
of
the
workhouse
,
whom
you
know
well
,
offers
him
eight
*NL*
hundred
to
be
tutor
to
his
children
.
My
inner
self
is
*NL*
tranquil
,
thanks
to
God
.
I
am
accustoming
myself
to
the
*NL*
terrible
blow
,
`
Vale
et
me
ama
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
Pirard
,
speaking
more
slowly
as
he
read
the
signature
,
*NL*
pronounced
with
a
sigh
the
word
,
``
Chelan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
tranquil
,
''
he
said
,
``
in
fact
his
righteousness
deserves
such
a
*NL*
recompense
.
May
God
grant
it
to
me
in
such
a
case
.
''
He
looked
up
to
*NL*
heaven
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
.
At
the
sight
of
that
sacred
sign
*NL*
Julien
felt
an
alleviation
of
the
profound
horror
which
had
frozen
him
*NL*
since
his
entry
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
here
three
hundred
and
twenty-one
aspirants
for
the
most
holy
*NL*
state
,
''
said
the
abbe
Pirard
at
last
,
in
a
tone
,
which
though
severe
,
*NL*
was
not
malicious
;
``
only
seven
or
eight
have
been
recommended
to
me
by
*NL*
such
men
as
the
abbe
Chelan
;
so
you
will
be
the
ninth
of
these
among
*NL*
the
three
hundred
and
twenty-one
.
But
my
protection
means
neither
*NL*
favour
nor
weakness
,
it
means
doubled
care
,
and
doubled
severity
*NL*
against
vice
.
Go
and
lock
that
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julian
made
an
effort
to
walk
,
and
managed
not
to
fall
.
He
noticed
that
*NL*
a
little
window
near
the
entrance
door
looked
out
on
to
the
country
.
*NL*
He
saw
the
trees
;
that
sight
did
him
as
much
good
as
the
sight
of
old
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Loquerisne
linquam
latinam
?
'
''
-LRB-
Do
you
speak
Latin
?
-RRB-
said
the
abbe
*NL*
Pirard
to
him
as
he
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Ita
,
pater
optime
,
'
''
-LRB-
Yes
,
excellent
Father
-RRB-
answered
Julien
,
*NL*
recovering
himself
a
little
.
But
it
was
certain
that
nobody
in
the
*NL*
world
had
ever
appeared
to
him
less
excellent
than
had
M.
Pirard
for
*NL*
the
last
half
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
continued
in
Latin
.
The
expression
in
the
abbe
's
eyes
*NL*
softened
.
Julien
regained
some
self-possession
.
``
How
weak
I
am
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
``
to
let
myself
be
imposed
on
by
these
appearances
of
virtue
.
*NL*
The
man
is
probably
nothing
more
than
a
rascal
,
like
M.
Maslon
,
''
and
*NL*
Julien
congratulated
himself
on
having
hidden
nearly
all
his
money
in
*NL*
his
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
Pirard
examined
Julien
in
theology
;
he
was
surprised
at
*NL*
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
,
but
his
astonishment
increased
when
he
*NL*
questioned
him
in
particular
on
sacred
scriptures
.
But
when
it
came
to
*NL*
questions
of
the
doctrines
of
the
Fathers
,
he
perceived
that
Julien
*NL*
scarcely
even
knew
the
names
of
Saint
Jerome
,
Saint
Augustin
,
Saint
*NL*
Bonaventure
,
Saint
Basile
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
''
thought
the
abbe
Pirard
,
``
this
is
simply
that
*NL*
fatal
tendency
to
Protestantism
for
which
I
have
always
reproached
*NL*
Chelan
.
A
profound
,
and
only
too
profound
knowledge
of
the
Holy
*NL*
Scriptures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Julien
had
just
started
speaking
to
him
,
without
being
questioned
on
*NL*
the
point
,
about
the
real
time
when
Genesis
,
the
Pentateuch
,
etc.
,
has
*NL*
been
written
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
what
does
this
never-ending
reasoning
over
the
Holy
Scriptures
lead
*NL*
to
?
''
thought
the
abbe
Pirard
,
``
if
not
to
self-examination
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
the
most
awful
Protestantism
.
And
by
the
side
of
this
imprudent
*NL*
knowledge
,
nothing
about
the
Fathers
to
compensate
for
that
tendency
.

*NL*
*NL*
But
the
astonishment
of
the
director
of
the
seminary
was
quite
*NL*
unbounded
when
having
questioned
Julien
about
the
authority
of
the
*NL*
Pope
,
and
expecting
to
hear
the
maxims
of
the
ancient
Gallican
Church
,
*NL*
the
young
man
recited
to
him
the
whole
book
of
M.
de
Maistre
``
Strange
*NL*
man
,
that
Chelan
,
''
thought
the
abbe
Pirard
.
``
Did
he
show
him
the
book
*NL*
simply
to
teach
him
to
make
fun
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
he
questioned
Julien
and
endeavoured
to
guess
if
*NL*
he
seriously
believed
in
the
doctrine
of
M.
de
Maistre
.
The
young
man
*NL*
only
answered
what
he
had
learnt
by
heart
.
From
this
moment
Julien
was
*NL*
really
happy
.
He
felt
that
he
was
master
of
himself
.
After
a
very
long
*NL*
examination
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
M.
Pirard
's
severity
towards
him
was
*NL*
only
affected
.
Indeed
,
the
director
of
the
seminary
would
have
embraced
*NL*
Julien
in
the
name
of
logic
,
for
he
found
so
much
clearness
,
precision
*NL*
and
lucidity
in
his
answers
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
principles
of
*NL*
austere
gravity
towards
his
theology
pupils
which
he
had
inculcated
in
*NL*
himself
for
the
last
fifteen
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
have
a
bold
and
healthy
mind
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
but
corpus
*NL*
debile
''
-LRB-
the
body
is
weak
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
often
fall
like
that
?
''
he
said
to
Julien
in
French
,
pointing
*NL*
with
his
finger
to
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
first
time
in
my
life
.
The
porter
's
face
unnerved
me
,
''
added
*NL*
Julien
,
blushing
like
a
child
.
The
abbe
Pirard
almost
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
result
of
vain
worldly
pomp
.
You
are
apparently
accustomed
*NL*
to
smiling
faces
,
those
veritable
theatres
of
falsehood
.
Truth
is
*NL*
austere
,
Monsieur
,
but
is
not
our
task
down
here
also
austere
?
You
must
*NL*
be
careful
that
your
conscience
guards
against
that
weakness
of
yours
,
*NL*
too
much
sensibility
to
vain
external
graces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
not
been
recommended
to
me
,
''
said
the
abbe
Pirard
,
resuming
*NL*
the
Latin
language
with
an
obvious
pleasure
,
``
If
you
had
not
been
*NL*
recommended
by
a
man
,
by
the
abbe
Chelan
,
I
would
talk
to
you
the
vain
*NL*
language
of
that
world
,
to
which
it
would
appear
you
are
only
too
well
*NL*
accustomed
.
I
would
tell
you
that
the
full
stipend
which
you
solicit
*NL*
is
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
obtain
.
But
the
fifty-six
*NL*
years
which
the
abbe
Chelan
has
spent
in
apostolic
work
have
stood
him
*NL*
in
poor
stead
if
he
can
not
dispose
of
a
stipend
at
the
seminary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
these
words
,
the
abbe
Pirard
recommended
Julien
not
to
enter
any
*NL*
secret
society
or
congregation
without
his
consent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
my
word
of
honour
,
''
said
Julien
,
with
all
an
honest
man
's
*NL*
expansion
of
heart
.
The
director
of
the
seminary
smiled
for
the
first
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
expression
is
not
used
here
,
''
he
said
to
him
.
``
It
is
too
*NL*
reminiscent
of
that
vain
honour
of
worldly
people
,
which
leads
them
to
*NL*
so
many
errors
and
often
to
so
many
crimes
.
You
owe
me
obedience
by
*NL*
virtue
of
paragraph
seventeen
of
the
bull
Unam
Eccesiam
of
St.
Pius
the
*NL*
Fifth
.
I
am
your
ecclesiastical
superior
.
To
hear
in
this
house
,
my
*NL*
dear
son
,
is
to
obey
.
How
much
money
,
have
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
So
here
we
are
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
,
``
that
was
the
reason
of
the
*NL*
`
my
very
dear
son
'
-RRB-
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirty-five
francs
,
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Write
out
carefully
how
you
use
that
money
.
You
will
have
to
give
me
*NL*
an
account
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
painful
audience
had
lasted
three
hours
.
Julien
summoned
the
*NL*
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
install
Julien
Sorel
in
cell
No.
103
,
''
said
the
abbe
Pirard
to
*NL*
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
great
favour
he
let
Julien
have
a
place
all
to
himself
.
``
Carry
his
*NL*
box
there
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
lowered
his
eyes
,
and
recognised
his
box
just
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
He
had
been
looking
at
it
for
three
hours
and
had
not
recognised
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
arrived
at
No.
103
,
which
was
a
little
room
eight
feet
square
on
*NL*
the
top
story
of
the
house
,
Julien
noticed
that
it
looked
out
on
to
the
*NL*
ramparts
,
and
he
perceived
beyond
them
the
pretty
plain
which
the
Doubs
*NL*
divides
from
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
charming
view
!
''
exclaimed
Julien
.
In
speaking
like
this
he
did
*NL*
not
feel
what
the
words
actually
expressed
.
The
violent
sensations
*NL*
which
he
had
experienced
during
the
short
time
that
he
had
been
at
*NL*
Besancon
had
absolutely
exhausted
his
strength
.
He
sat
down
near
the
*NL*
window
on
the
one
wooden
chair
in
the
cell
,
and
fell
at
once
into
a
*NL*
profound
sleep
.
He
did
not
hear
either
the
supper
bell
or
the
bell
for
*NL*
benediction
.
They
had
forgotten
him
.
When
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
*NL*
woke
him
up
the
following
morning
,
he
found
himself
lying
on
the
floor
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
WORLD
,
OR
WHAT
THE
RICH
LACK
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
alone
in
the
world
.
No
one
deigns
to
spare
me
*NL*
a
thought
.
All
those
whom
I
see
make
their
fortune
,
*NL*
have
an
insolence
and
hardness
of
heart
which
I
do
not
*NL*
feel
in
myself
.
They
hate
me
by
reason
of
kindness
*NL*
and
good-humour
.
Oh
,
I
shall
die
soon
,
either
from
*NL*
starvation
or
the
unhappiness
of
seeing
men
so
hard
of
*NL*
heart
.
--
_
Young
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
hastened
to
brush
his
clothes
and
run
down
.
He
was
late
.
Instead
of
*NL*
trying
to
justify
himself
Julien
crossed
his
arms
over
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peccavi
pater
optime
-LRB-
I
have
sinned
,
I
confess
my
fault
,
oh
,
my
*NL*
father
-RRB-
,
''
he
said
with
a
contrite
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
first
speech
was
a
great
success
.
The
clever
ones
among
the
*NL*
seminarists
saw
that
they
had
to
deal
with
a
man
who
knew
something
*NL*
about
the
elements
of
the
profession
.
The
recreation
hour
arrived
,
and
*NL*
Julien
saw
that
he
was
the
object
of
general
curiosity
,
but
he
only
*NL*
manifested
reserved
silence
.
Following
the
maxims
he
had
laid
down
for
*NL*
himself
,
he
considered
his
three
hundred
and
twenty-one
comrades
as
*NL*
enemies
.
The
most
dangerous
of
all
in
his
eyes
was
the
abbe
Pirard
.
A
*NL*
few
days
afterwards
Julien
had
to
choose
a
confessor
,
and
was
given
a
*NL*
list
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
heavens
!
what
do
they
take
me
for
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Do
they
*NL*
think
I
do
n't
understand
what
's
what
?
''
Then
he
chose
the
abbe
Pirard
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
step
proved
decisive
without
his
suspecting
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
seminarist
,
who
was
quite
young
and
a
native
of
Verrieres
,
and
*NL*
who
had
declared
himself
his
friend
since
the
first
day
,
informed
him
*NL*
that
he
would
probably
have
acted
more
prudently
if
he
had
chosen
M.
*NL*
Castanede
,
the
sub-director
of
the
seminary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
abbe
Castanede
is
the
enemy
of
Pirard
,
who
is
suspected
of
*NL*
Jansenism
,
''
added
the
little
seminarist
in
a
whisper
.
All
the
first
*NL*
steps
of
our
hero
were
,
in
spite
of
the
prudence
on
which
he
plumed
*NL*
himself
,
as
much
mistakes
as
his
choice
of
a
confessor
.
Misled
as
he
*NL*
was
by
all
the
self-confidence
of
a
man
of
imagination
,
he
took
his
*NL*
projects
for
facts
,
and
believed
that
he
was
a
consummate
hypocrite
.
*NL*
His
folly
went
so
far
as
to
reproach
himself
for
his
success
in
this
*NL*
kind
of
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
it
is
my
only
weapon
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
At
another
period
I
*NL*
should
have
earned
my
livelihood
by
eloquent
deeds
in
the
face
of
the
*NL*
enemy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Satisfied
as
he
was
with
his
own
conduct
,
Julien
looked
around
him
.
He
*NL*
found
everywhere
the
appearance
of
the
purest
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eight
or
ten
seminarists
lived
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
,
and
had
*NL*
visions
like
Saint
Theresa
,
and
Saint
Francis
,
when
he
received
his
*NL*
stigmata
on
Mount
_
Vernia
_
in
the
Appenines
.
But
it
was
a
great
secret
*NL*
and
their
friends
concealed
it
.
These
poor
young
people
who
had
*NL*
visions
were
always
in
the
infirmary
.
A
hundred
others
combined
an
*NL*
indefatigable
application
to
a
robust
faith
.
They
worked
till
they
fell
*NL*
ill
,
but
without
learning
much
.
Two
or
three
were
distinguished
by
a
*NL*
real
talent
,
amongst
others
a
student
of
the
name
of
Chazel
,
but
both
*NL*
they
and
Julien
felt
mutually
unsympathetic
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
these
three
hundred
and
twenty-one
seminarists
consisted
*NL*
exclusively
of
coarse
persons
,
who
were
by
no
means
sure
of
*NL*
understanding
the
Latin
words
which
they
kept
on
repeating
the
livelong
*NL*
day
.
Nearly
all
were
the
sons
of
peasants
,
and
they
preferred
to
gain
*NL*
their
livelihood
by
reciting
some
Latin
words
than
by
ploughing
the
*NL*
earth
.
It
was
after
this
examination
of
his
colleagues
that
Julien
,
*NL*
during
the
first
few
days
,
promised
himself
a
speedy
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Intelligent
people
are
needed
in
every
service
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
for
,
after
all
,
there
is
work
to
be
done
.
I
should
have
been
a
*NL*
sergeant
under
Napoleon
.
I
shall
be
a
grand
vicar
among
these
future
*NL*
cures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
these
poor
devils
,
''
he
added
,
``
manual
labourers
as
they
have
been
*NL*
since
their
childhood
,
have
lived
on
curded
milk
and
black
bread
up
*NL*
till
they
arrived
here
.
They
would
only
eat
meat
five
or
six
times
a
*NL*
year
in
their
hovels
.
Like
the
Roman
soldiers
who
used
to
find
war
the
*NL*
time
of
rest
,
these
poor
peasants
are
enchanted
with
the
delights
of
*NL*
the
seminary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
could
never
read
anything
in
their
gloomy
eyes
but
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
physical
craving
after
dinner
,
and
the
expectation
*NL*
of
sensual
pleasure
before
the
meal
.
Such
were
the
people
among
whom
*NL*
Julien
had
to
distinguish
himself
;
but
the
fact
which
he
did
not
know
,
*NL*
and
which
they
refrained
from
telling
him
,
was
that
coming
out
first
*NL*
in
the
different
courses
of
dogma
,
ecclesiastical
history
,
etc.
,
etc.
,
*NL*
which
are
taken
at
the
seminary
,
constituted
in
their
eyes
,
neither
*NL*
more
nor
less
than
a
splendid
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
time
of
Voltaire
and
two-chamber
Government
,
which
is
at
*NL*
bottom
simply
distrust
and
personal
self-examination
,
and
gives
the
*NL*
popular
mind
that
bad
habit
of
being
suspicious
,
the
Church
of
France
*NL*
seems
to
have
realised
that
books
are
its
real
enemies
.
It
is
the
*NL*
submissive
heart
which
counts
for
everything
in
its
eyes
.
It
suspects
,
*NL*
and
rightly
so
,
any
success
in
studies
,
even
sacred
ones
.
What
is
to
*NL*
prevent
a
superior
man
from
crossing
over
to
the
opposite
side
like
*NL*
Sieyes
or
Gregory
.
The
trembling
Church
clings
on
to
the
Pope
as
its
*NL*
one
chance
of
safety
.
The
Pope
alone
is
in
a
position
to
attempt
to
*NL*
paralyse
all
personal
self-examination
,
and
to
make
an
impression
by
*NL*
means
of
the
pompous
piety
of
his
court
ceremonial
on
the
bored
and
*NL*
morbid
spirit
of
fashionable
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
,
as
he
began
to
get
some
glimpse
of
these
various
truths
,
*NL*
which
are
none
the
less
in
total
contradiction
to
all
the
official
*NL*
pronouncements
of
any
seminary
,
fell
into
a
profound
melancholy
.
He
*NL*
worked
a
great
deal
and
rapidly
succeeded
in
learning
things
which
were
*NL*
extremely
useful
to
a
priest
,
extremely
false
in
his
own
eyes
,
and
*NL*
devoid
of
the
slightest
interest
for
him
.
He
felt
there
was
nothing
*NL*
else
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
then
forgotten
by
the
whole
world
,
''
he
thought
.
He
did
not
know
*NL*
that
M.
Pirard
had
received
and
thrown
into
the
fire
several
letters
*NL*
with
the
Dijon
stamp
in
which
the
most
lively
passion
would
pierce
*NL*
through
the
most
formal
conventionalism
of
style
.
``
This
love
seems
to
*NL*
be
fought
by
great
attacks
of
remorse
.
All
the
better
,
''
thought
the
*NL*
abbe
Pirard
.
``
At
any
rate
this
lad
has
not
loved
an
infidel
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
the
abbe
Pirard
opened
a
letter
which
seemed
half-blotted
out
*NL*
by
tears
.
It
was
an
adieu
for
ever
.
``
At
last
,
''
said
the
writer
to
*NL*
Julien
,
``
Heaven
has
granted
me
the
grace
of
hating
,
not
the
author
of
*NL*
my
fall
,
but
my
fall
itself
.
The
sacrifice
has
been
made
,
dear
one
,
not
*NL*
without
tears
as
you
see
.
The
safety
of
those
to
whom
I
must
devote
*NL*
my
life
,
and
whom
you
love
so
much
,
is
the
decisive
factor
.
A
just
*NL*
but
terrible
God
will
no
longer
see
His
way
to
avenge
on
them
their
*NL*
mother
's
crimes
.
Adieu
,
Julien
.
Be
just
towards
all
men
.
''
The
end
of
*NL*
the
letter
was
nearly
entirely
illegible
.
The
writer
gave
an
address
at
*NL*
Dijon
,
but
at
the
same
time
expressed
the
hope
that
Julien
would
not
*NL*
answer
,
or
at
any
rate
would
employ
language
which
a
reformed
woman
*NL*
could
read
without
blushing
.
Julien
's
melancholy
,
aggravated
by
the
*NL*
mediocre
nourishment
which
the
contractor
who
gave
dinners
at
thirteen
*NL*
centimes
per
head
supplied
to
the
seminary
,
began
to
affect
his
health
,
*NL*
when
Fouque
suddenly
appeared
in
his
room
one
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
able
to
get
in
at
last
.
I
have
duly
been
five
times
to
*NL*
Besancon
in
order
to
see
you
.
Could
never
get
in
.
I
put
someone
by
the
*NL*
door
to
watch
.
Why
the
devil
do
n't
you
ever
go
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
test
which
I
have
imposed
on
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
find
you
greatly
changed
,
but
here
you
are
again
.
I
have
just
*NL*
learned
from
a
couple
of
good
five
franc
pieces
that
I
was
only
a
fool
*NL*
not
to
have
offered
them
on
my
first
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
of
the
two
friends
went
on
for
ever
.
Julien
changed
*NL*
colour
when
Fouque
said
to
him
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
by
the
by
,
that
your
pupils
'
mother
has
become
positively
*NL*
devout
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
to
talk
in
that
off-hand
manner
which
makes
so
singular
an
*NL*
impression
on
the
passionate
soul
,
whose
dearest
interests
are
being
*NL*
destroyed
without
the
speaker
having
the
faintest
suspicion
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
friend
,
the
most
exalted
devoutness
.
She
is
said
to
make
*NL*
pilgrimages
.
But
to
the
eternal
shame
of
the
abbe
Maslon
,
who
has
*NL*
played
the
spy
so
long
on
that
poor
M.
Chelan
,
Madame
de
Renal
would
*NL*
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
.
She
goes
to
confession
to
Dijon
or
*NL*
Besancon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
goes
to
Besancon
,
''
said
Julien
,
flushing
all
over
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
often
,
''
said
Fouque
in
a
questioning
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
any
_
Constitutionnels
_
on
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
?
''
replied
Fouque
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
asking
if
you
've
got
any
_
Constitutionnels
_
?
''
went
on
Julien
*NL*
in
the
quietest
tone
imaginable
.
``
They
cost
thirty
sous
a
number
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
exclaimed
Fouque
.
``
Liberals
even
in
the
seminary
!
Poor
France
,
''
*NL*
he
added
,
assuming
the
abbe
Maslon
's
hypocritical
voice
and
sugary
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
visit
would
have
made
a
deep
impression
on
our
hero
,
if
he
had
not
*NL*
been
put
on
the
track
of
an
important
discovery
by
some
words
addressed
*NL*
to
him
the
following
day
by
the
little
seminarist
from
Verrieres
.
*NL*
Julien
's
conduct
since
he
had
been
at
the
seminary
had
been
nothing
but
*NL*
a
series
of
false
steps
.
He
began
to
make
bitter
fun
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
point
of
fact
the
important
actions
in
his
life
had
been
cleverly
*NL*
managed
,
but
he
was
careless
about
details
,
and
cleverness
in
a
*NL*
seminary
consists
in
attention
to
details
.
Consequently
,
he
had
already
*NL*
the
reputation
among
his
comrades
of
being
a
_
strong-minded
person
.
_
He
*NL*
had
been
betrayed
by
a
number
of
little
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
convicted
in
their
eyes
of
this
enormity
,
_
he
thought
and
*NL*
judged
for
himself
_
instead
of
blindly
following
authority
and
example
.
*NL*
The
abbe
Pirard
had
been
no
help
to
him
.
He
had
not
spoken
to
him
*NL*
on
a
single
occasion
apart
from
the
confessional
,
and
even
there
he
*NL*
listened
more
than
he
spoke
.
Matters
would
have
been
very
different
if
*NL*
he
had
chosen
the
abbe
Castanede
.
The
moment
that
Julien
realised
his
*NL*
folly
,
he
ceased
to
be
bored
.
He
wished
to
know
the
whole
extent
of
the
*NL*
evil
,
and
to
effect
this
emerged
a
little
from
that
haughty
obstinate
*NL*
silence
with
which
he
had
scrupulously
rebuffed
his
comrades
.
It
was
*NL*
now
that
they
took
their
revenge
on
him
.
His
advances
were
welcomed
by
*NL*
a
contempt
verging
on
derision
.
He
realised
that
there
had
not
been
one
*NL*
single
hour
from
the
time
of
his
entry
into
the
seminary
,
particularly
*NL*
during
recreation
time
,
which
had
not
resulted
in
affecting
him
one
*NL*
way
or
another
,
which
had
not
increased
the
number
of
his
enemies
,
or
*NL*
won
for
him
the
goodwill
of
some
seminarist
who
was
either
sincerely
*NL*
virtuous
or
of
a
fibre
slightly
less
coarse
than
that
of
the
others
.
*NL*
The
evil
to
repair
was
infinite
,
and
the
task
very
difficult
.
*NL*
Henceforth
,
Julien
's
attention
was
always
on
guard
.
The
problem
before
*NL*
him
was
to
map
out
a
new
character
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moving
of
his
eyes
for
example
,
occasioned
him
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
trouble
.
It
is
with
good
reason
that
they
are
carried
lowered
in
these
*NL*
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
presumptuous
I
was
at
Verrieres
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
``
I
*NL*
thought
I
lived
;
I
was
only
preparing
for
life
,
and
here
I
am
at
last
*NL*
in
the
world
such
as
I
shall
find
it
,
until
my
part
comes
to
an
end
,
*NL*
surrounded
by
real
enemies
.
What
immense
difficulties
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
``
are
involved
in
keeping
up
this
hypocrisy
every
single
minute
.
It
is
*NL*
enough
to
put
the
labours
of
Hercules
into
the
shade
.
The
Hercules
of
*NL*
modern
times
is
the
Pope
Sixtus
Quintus
,
who
deceived
by
his
modesty
*NL*
fifteen
years
on
end
forty
Cardinals
who
had
seen
the
liveliness
and
*NL*
haughtiness
of
his
whole
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
knowledge
is
nothing
here
,
''
he
said
to
himself
with
disgust
.
*NL*
``
Progress
in
doctrine
,
in
sacred
history
,
etc.
,
only
seem
to
count
.
*NL*
Everything
said
on
those
subjects
is
only
intended
to
entrap
fools
like
*NL*
me
.
Alas
my
only
merit
consists
in
my
rapid
progress
,
and
in
the
way
in
*NL*
which
I
grasp
all
their
nonsense
.
Do
they
really
value
those
things
at
*NL*
their
true
worth
?
Do
they
judge
them
like
I
do
.
And
I
had
the
stupidity
*NL*
to
be
proud
of
my
quickness
.
The
only
result
of
my
coming
out
top
has
*NL*
been
to
give
me
inveterate
enemies
.
Chazel
,
who
really
knows
more
than
*NL*
I
do
,
always
throws
some
blunder
in
his
compositions
which
gets
him
put
*NL*
back
to
the
fiftieth
place
.
If
he
comes
out
first
,
it
is
only
because
*NL*
he
is
absent-minded
.
O
how
useful
would
one
word
,
just
one
word
,
of
M.
*NL*
Pirard
,
have
been
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Julien
was
disillusioned
,
the
long
exercises
in
ascetic
*NL*
piety
,
such
as
the
attendances
in
the
chapel
five
times
a
week
,
the
*NL*
intonation
of
hymns
at
the
chapel
of
the
Sacre
Coeur
,
etc.
,
etc.
,
*NL*
which
had
previously
seemed
to
him
so
deadly
boring
,
became
his
most
*NL*
interesting
opportunities
for
action
.
Thanks
to
a
severe
introspection
,
*NL*
and
above
all
,
by
trying
not
to
overdo
his
methods
,
Julien
did
not
*NL*
attempt
at
the
outset
to
perform
significant
actions
-LRB-
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
actions
which
are
proof
of
a
certain
Christian
perfection
-RRB-
like
those
*NL*
seminarists
who
served
as
a
model
to
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seminarists
have
a
special
way
,
even
of
eating
a
poached
egg
,
which
*NL*
betokens
progress
in
the
devout
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
who
smiles
at
this
will
perhaps
be
good
enough
to
remember
*NL*
all
the
mistakes
which
the
abbe
Delille
made
over
the
eating
of
an
egg
*NL*
when
he
was
invited
to
breakfast
with
a
lady
of
the
Court
of
Louis
XVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
first
tried
to
arrive
at
the
state
of
_
non
culpa
_
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
the
state
of
the
young
seminarist
whose
demeanour
and
manner
*NL*
of
moving
his
arms
,
eyes
,
etc.
while
in
fact
without
any
trace
of
*NL*
worldliness
,
do
not
yet
indicate
that
the
person
is
entirely
absorbed
*NL*
by
the
conception
of
the
other
world
,
and
the
idea
of
the
pure
*NL*
nothingness
of
this
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
incessantly
found
such
phrases
as
these
charcoaled
on
the
walls
*NL*
of
the
corridors
.
``
What
are
sixty
years
of
ordeals
balanced
against
*NL*
an
eternity
of
delights
or
any
eternity
of
boiling
oil
in
hell
?
''
He
*NL*
despised
them
no
longer
.
He
realised
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
them
*NL*
incessantly
before
his
eyes
.
``
What
am
I
going
to
do
all
my
life
,
''
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
.
``
I
shall
sell
to
the
faithful
a
place
in
heaven
.
How
*NL*
am
I
going
to
make
that
place
visible
to
their
eyes
?
By
the
difference
*NL*
between
my
appearance
and
that
of
a
layman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
several
months
of
absolutely
unremitting
application
,
Julien
*NL*
still
had
the
appearance
of
thinking
.
The
way
in
which
he
would
move
*NL*
his
eyes
and
hold
his
mouth
did
not
betoken
that
implicit
faith
which
*NL*
is
ready
to
believe
everything
and
undergo
everything
,
even
at
the
cost
*NL*
of
martyrdom
.
Julien
saw
with
anger
that
he
was
surpassed
in
this
by
*NL*
the
coarsest
peasants
.
There
was
good
reason
for
their
not
appearing
*NL*
full
of
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
pains
did
he
not
take
to
acquire
that
facial
expression
of
blindly
*NL*
fervent
faith
which
is
found
so
frequently
in
the
Italian
convents
,
*NL*
and
of
which
Le
Guerchin
has
left
such
perfect
models
in
his
Church
*NL*
pictures
for
the
benefit
of
us
laymen
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
feast-days
,
the
seminarists
were
regaled
with
sausages
and
cabbage
.
*NL*
Julien
's
table
neighbours
observed
that
he
did
not
appreciate
this
*NL*
happiness
.
That
was
looked
upon
as
one
of
his
paramount
crimes
.
*NL*
His
comrades
saw
in
this
a
most
odious
trait
,
and
the
most
foolish
*NL*
hypocrisy
.
Nothing
made
him
more
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
this
bourgeois
,
look
at
this
stuck-up
person
,
''
they
would
*NL*
say
,
``
who
pretends
to
despise
the
best
rations
there
are
,
sausages
and
*NL*
cabbage
,
shame
on
the
villain
!
The
haughty
wretch
,
he
is
damned
for
*NL*
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
these
young
peasants
,
who
are
my
comrades
,
find
their
ignorance
*NL*
an
immense
advantage
,
''
Julien
would
exclaim
in
his
moments
of
*NL*
discouragement
.
``
The
professor
has
not
got
to
deliver
them
on
their
*NL*
arrival
at
the
seminary
from
that
awful
number
of
worldly
ideas
which
I
*NL*
brought
into
it
,
and
which
they
read
on
my
face
whatever
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
watched
with
an
attention
bordering
on
envy
the
coarsest
of
the
*NL*
little
peasants
who
arrived
at
the
seminary
.
From
the
moment
when
they
*NL*
were
made
to
doff
their
shabby
jackets
to
don
the
black
robe
,
their
*NL*
education
consisted
of
an
immense
and
limitless
respect
for
_
hard
*NL*
liquid
cash
_
as
they
say
in
Franche-Comte
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
the
consecrated
and
heroic
way
of
expressing
the
sublime
idea
*NL*
of
current
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
seminarists
,
like
the
heroes
in
Voltaire
's
novels
,
found
their
*NL*
happiness
in
dining
well
.
Julien
discovered
in
nearly
all
of
them
*NL*
an
innate
respect
for
the
man
who
wears
a
suit
of
good
cloth
.
This
*NL*
sentiment
appreciates
the
distributive
justice
,
which
is
given
us
at
*NL*
our
courts
,
at
its
value
or
even
above
its
true
value
.
``
What
can
one
*NL*
gain
,
''
they
would
often
repeat
among
themselves
,
``
by
having
a
law
suit
*NL*
with
'
a
big
man
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
the
expression
current
in
the
valleys
of
the
Jura
to
express
*NL*
a
rich
man
.
One
can
judge
of
their
respect
for
the
richest
entity
*NL*
of
all
--
the
government
.
Failure
to
smile
deferentially
at
the
mere
*NL*
name
of
M.
the
Prefect
is
regarded
as
an
imprudence
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
Franche-Comte
peasant
,
and
imprudence
in
poor
people
is
quickly
*NL*
punished
by
lack
of
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
having
been
almost
suffocated
at
first
by
his
feeling
of
*NL*
contempt
,
Julien
eventually
experienced
a
feeling
of
pity
;
it
often
*NL*
happened
that
the
fathers
of
most
of
his
comrades
would
enter
their
*NL*
hovel
in
winter
evenings
and
fail
to
find
there
either
bread
,
chestnuts
*NL*
or
potatoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
there
astonishing
then
?
''
Julien
would
say
to
himself
,
``
if
in
*NL*
their
eyes
the
happy
man
is
in
the
first
place
the
one
who
has
just
had
*NL*
a
good
dinner
,
and
in
the
second
place
the
one
who
possesses
a
good
*NL*
suit
?
My
comrades
have
a
lasting
vocation
,
that
is
to
say
,
they
see
*NL*
in
the
ecclesiastical
calling
a
long
continuance
of
the
happiness
of
*NL*
dining
well
and
having
a
warm
suit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
happened
to
hear
a
young
imaginative
seminarist
say
to
his
*NL*
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
I
become
Pope
like
Sixtus
Quintus
who
kept
pigs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
only
make
Italians
Popes
,
''
answered
his
friend
.
``
But
they
will
*NL*
certainly
draw
lots
amongst
us
for
the
great
vicarships
,
canonries
and
*NL*
perhaps
bishoprics
.

*NL*
One
day
,
in
the
middle
of
a
theology
lesson
,
the
Abbe
Pirard
summoned
*NL*
Julien
to
him
.
The
young
fellow
was
delighted
to
leave
the
dark
,
moral
*NL*
atmosphere
in
which
he
had
been
plunged
.
Julien
received
from
the
*NL*
director
the
same
welcome
which
had
frightened
him
so
much
on
the
first
*NL*
day
of
his
entry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
to
me
what
is
written
on
this
playing
card
?
''
he
said
,
looking
*NL*
at
him
in
a
way
calculated
to
make
him
sink
into
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
read
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amanda
Binet
of
the
Giraffe
Cafe
before
eight
o'clock
.
Say
you
're
from
*NL*
Genlis
,
and
my
mother
's
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
realised
the
immense
danger
.
The
spies
of
the
abbe
Castanede
had
*NL*
stolen
the
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
trembling
with
fear
the
day
I
came
here
,
''
he
answered
,
looking
*NL*
at
the
abbe
Pirard
's
forehead
,
for
he
could
not
endure
that
terrible
*NL*
gaze
.
``
M.
Chelan
told
me
that
this
is
a
place
of
informers
and
*NL*
mischief-makers
of
all
kinds
,
and
that
spying
and
tale-bearing
by
one
*NL*
comrade
on
another
was
encouraged
by
the
authorities
.
Heaven
wishes
it
*NL*
to
be
so
,
so
as
to
show
life
such
as
it
is
to
the
young
priests
,
and
*NL*
fill
them
with
disgust
for
the
world
and
all
its
pomps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
's
to
me
that
you
make
these
fine
speeches
,
''
said
the
abbe
*NL*
Pirard
furiously
.
``
You
young
villain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brothers
used
to
beat
me
at
Verrieres
,
''
answered
Julien
coldly
,
*NL*
``
When
they
had
occasion
to
be
jealous
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
indeed
,
''
exclaimed
M.
Pirard
,
almost
beside
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
went
on
with
his
story
without
being
in
the
least
intimidated
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
of
my
arrival
at
Besancon
I
was
hungry
,
and
I
entered
a
*NL*
cafe
.
My
spirit
was
full
of
revulsion
for
so
profane
a
place
,
but
I
*NL*
thought
that
my
breakfast
would
cost
me
less
than
at
an
inn
.
A
lady
,
*NL*
who
seemed
to
be
the
mistress
of
the
establishment
,
took
pity
on
my
*NL*
inexperience
.
`
Besancon
is
full
of
bad
characters
,
'
she
said
to
me
.
'
I
*NL*
fear
something
will
happen
to
you
,
sir
.
If
some
mishap
should
occur
to
*NL*
you
,
have
recourse
to
me
and
send
to
my
house
before
eight
o'clock
.
If
*NL*
the
porters
of
the
seminary
refuse
to
execute
your
errand
,
say
you
are
*NL*
my
cousin
and
a
native
of
Genlis
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
have
all
this
chatter
verified
,
''
exclaimed
the
abbe
Pirard
,
*NL*
unable
to
stand
still
,
and
walking
about
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Back
to
the
cell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
followed
Julien
and
locked
him
in
.
The
latter
immediately
*NL*
began
to
examine
his
trunk
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
the
fatal
cards
had
*NL*
been
so
carefully
hidden
.
Nothing
was
missing
in
the
trunk
,
but
several
*NL*
things
had
been
disarranged
.
Nevertheless
,
he
had
never
been
without
*NL*
the
key
.
What
luck
that
,
during
the
whole
time
of
my
blindness
,
said
*NL*
Julien
to
himself
,
I
never
availed
myself
of
the
permission
to
go
out
*NL*
that
Monsieur
Castanede
would
offer
me
so
frequently
,
with
a
kindness
*NL*
which
I
now
understand
.
Perhaps
I
should
have
had
the
weakness
to
have
*NL*
changed
my
clothes
and
gone
to
see
the
fair
Amanda
,
and
then
I
should
*NL*
have
been
ruined
.
When
they
gave
up
hope
of
exploiting
that
piece
of
*NL*
information
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
ruin
,
they
had
used
it
to
*NL*
inform
against
him
.
Two
hours
afterwards
the
director
summoned
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
not
lie
,
''
he
said
to
him
,
with
a
less
severe
look
,
``
but
*NL*
keeping
an
address
like
that
is
an
indiscretion
of
a
gravity
which
you
*NL*
are
unable
to
realise
.
Unhappy
child
!
It
may
perhaps
do
you
harm
in
ten
*NL*
years

time

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
FIRST
EXPERIENCE
OF
LIFE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
present
time
,
Great
God
!
is
the
ark
of
the
Lord
;
*NL*
cursed
be
he
who
touches
it
.
--
_
Diderot
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
kindly
excuse
us
if
we
give
very
few
clear
and
definite
*NL*
facts
concerning
this
period
of
Julien
's
life
.
It
is
not
that
we
*NL*
lack
facts
;
quite
the
contrary
.
But
it
may
be
that
what
he
saw
in
*NL*
the
seminary
is
too
black
for
the
medium
colour
which
the
author
*NL*
has
endeavoured
to
preserve
throughout
these
pages
.
Those
of
our
*NL*
contemporaries
who
have
suffered
from
certain
things
can
not
remember
*NL*
them
without
a
horror
which
paralyses
every
other
pleasure
,
even
that
*NL*
of
reading
a
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
achieved
scant
success
in
his
essays
at
hypocritical
gestures
.
*NL*
He
experienced
moments
of
disgust
,
and
even
of
complete
discouragement
.
*NL*
He
was
not
a
success
,
even
in
a
a
vile
career
.
The
slightest
help
*NL*
from
outside
would
have
sufficed
to
have
given
him
heart
again
,
for
*NL*
the
difficulty
to
overcome
was
not
very
great
,
but
he
was
alone
,
like
*NL*
a
derelict
ship
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
.
``
And
when
I
do
succeed
,
''
*NL*
he
would
say
to
himself
,
``
think
of
having
to
pass
a
whole
lifetime
in
*NL*
such
awful
company
,
gluttons
who
have
no
thought
but
for
the
large
*NL*
omelette
which
they
will
guzzle
at
dinner-time
,
or
persons
like
the
*NL*
abbe
Castanede
,
who
finds
no
crime
too
black
!
They
will
attain
power
,
*NL*
but
,
great
heavens
!
at
what
cost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
will
of
man
is
powerful
,
I
read
it
everywhere
,
but
is
it
enough
to
*NL*
overcome
so
great
a
disgust
?
The
task
of
all
the
great
men
was
easy
by
*NL*
comparison
.
However
terrible
was
the
danger
,
they
found
it
fine
,
and
*NL*
who
can
realise
,
except
myself
,
the
ugliness
of
my
surroundings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
moment
was
the
most
trying
in
his
whole
life
.
It
would
have
been
*NL*
so
easy
for
him
to
have
enlisted
in
one
of
the
fine
regiments
at
the
*NL*
garrison
of
Besancon
.
He
could
have
become
a
Latin
master
.
He
needed
so
*NL*
little
for
his
subsistence
,
but
in
that
case
no
more
career
,
no
more
*NL*
future
for
his
imagination
.
It
was
equivalent
to
death
.
Here
is
one
of
*NL*
his
sad
days
in
detail
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
so
often
presumed
to
congratulate
myself
on
being
different
*NL*
from
the
other
young
peasants
!
Well
,
I
have
lived
enough
to
realise
*NL*
that
_
difference
engenders
hate
_
,
''
he
said
to
himself
one
morning
.
*NL*
This
great
truth
had
just
been
borne
in
upon
him
by
one
of
his
most
*NL*
irritating
failures
.
He
had
been
working
for
eight
days
at
teaching
a
*NL*
pupil
who
lived
in
an
odour
of
sanctity
.
He
used
to
go
out
with
him
*NL*
into
the
courtyard
and
listen
submissively
to
pieces
of
fatuity
enough
*NL*
to
send
one
to
sleep
standing
.
Suddenly
the
weather
turned
stormy
.
The
*NL*
thunder
growled
,
and
the
holy
pupil
exclaimed
as
he
roughly
pushed
him
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
Everyone
for
himself
in
this
world
.
I
do
n't
want
to
be
burned
*NL*
by
the
thunder
.
God
may
strike
you
with
lightning
like
a
blasphemer
,
*NL*
like
a
Voltaire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
deserve
to
be
drowned
if
I
go
to
sleep
during
the
storm
,
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Julien
,
with
his
teeth
clenched
with
rage
,
and
with
his
eyes
opened
*NL*
towards
the
sky
now
furrowed
by
the
lightning
.
``
Let
us
try
the
conquest
*NL*
of
some
other
rogue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bell
rang
for
the
abbe
Castanede
's
course
of
sacred
history
.
That
*NL*
day
the
abbe
Castanede
was
teaching
those
young
peasants
already
*NL*
so
frightened
by
their
father
's
hardships
and
poverty
,
that
the
*NL*
Government
,
that
entity
so
terrible
in
their
eyes
,
possessed
no
real
*NL*
and
legitimate
power
except
by
virtue
of
the
delegation
of
God
's
vicar
*NL*
on
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Render
yourselves
worthy
,
by
the
holiness
of
your
life
and
by
your
*NL*
obedience
,
of
the
benevolence
of
the
Pope
.
Be
_
like
a
stick
in
his
*NL*
hands
_
,
''
he
added
,
``
and
you
will
obtain
a
superb
position
,
where
you
*NL*
will
be
far
from
all
control
,
and
enjoy
the
King
's
commands
,
a
position
*NL*
from
which
you
can
not
be
removed
,
and
where
one-third
of
the
salary
*NL*
is
paid
by
the
Government
,
while
the
faithful
who
are
moulded
by
your
*NL*
preaching
pay
the
other
two-thirds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Castanede
stopped
in
the
courtyard
after
he
left
the
lesson-room
.
``
It
*NL*
is
particularly
appropriate
to
say
of
a
cure
,
''
he
said
to
the
pupils
*NL*
who
formed
a
ring
round
him
,
``
that
the
place
is
worth
as
much
as
the
*NL*
man
is
worth
.
I
myself
have
known
parishes
in
the
mountains
where
the
*NL*
surplice
fees
were
worth
more
than
that
of
many
town
livings
.
There
was
*NL*
quite
as
much
money
,
without
counting
the
fat
capons
,
the
eggs
,
fresh
*NL*
butter
,
and
a
thousand
and
one
pleasant
details
,
and
there
the
cure
is
*NL*
indisputably
the
first
man
.
There
is
not
a
good
meal
to
which
he
is
not
*NL*
invited
,
feted
,
etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Castanede
had
scarcely
gone
back
to
his
room
before
the
pupils
split
up
*NL*
into
knots
.
Julien
did
not
form
part
of
any
of
them
;
he
was
left
out
*NL*
like
a
black
sheep
.
He
saw
in
every
knot
a
pupil
tossing
a
coin
in
the
*NL*
air
,
and
if
he
managed
to
guess
right
in
this
game
of
heads
or
tails
,
*NL*
his
comrades
would
decide
that
he
would
soon
have
one
of
those
fat
*NL*
livings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anecdotes
ensued
.
A
certain
young
priest
,
who
had
scarcely
been
*NL*
ordained
a
year
,
had
given
a
tame
rabbit
to
the
maidservant
of
an
old
*NL*
cure
,
and
had
succeeded
in
being
asked
to
be
his
curate
.
In
a
few
*NL*
months
afterwards
,
for
the
cure
had
quickly
died
,
he
had
replaced
him
*NL*
in
that
excellent
living
.
Another
had
succeeded
in
getting
himself
*NL*
designated
as
a
successor
to
a
very
rich
town
living
,
by
being
present
*NL*
at
all
the
meals
of
an
old
,
paralytic
cure
,
and
by
dexterously
carving
*NL*
his
poultry
.
The
seminarists
,
like
all
young
people
,
exaggerated
the
*NL*
effect
of
those
little
devices
,
which
have
an
element
of
originality
,
*NL*
and
which
strike
the
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
take
part
in
these
conversations
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
When
*NL*
they
did
not
talk
about
sausages
and
good
livings
,
the
conversation
ran
*NL*
on
the
worldly
aspect
of
ecclesiastical
doctrine
,
on
the
differences
of
*NL*
bishops
and
prefects
,
of
mayors
and
cures
.
Julien
caught
sight
of
the
*NL*
conception
of
a
second
god
,
but
of
a
god
who
was
much
more
formidable
*NL*
and
much
more
powerful
than
the
other
one
.
That
second
god
was
the
*NL*
Pope
.
They
said
among
themselves
,
in
a
low
voice
,
however
,
and
when
*NL*
they
were
quite
sure
that
they
would
not
be
heard
by
Pirard
,
that
*NL*
the
reason
for
the
Pope
not
taking
the
trouble
of
nominating
all
the
*NL*
prefects
and
mayors
of
France
,
was
that
he
had
entrusted
that
duty
to
*NL*
the
King
of
France
by
entitling
him
a
senior
son
of
the
Church
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
this
time
that
Julien
thought
he
could
exploit
,
for
the
*NL*
benefit
of
his
own
reputation
,
his
knowledge
of
De
Maistre
's
book
*NL*
on
the
Pope
.
In
point
of
fact
,
he
did
astonish
his
comrades
,
but
it
*NL*
was
only
another
misfortune
.
He
displeased
them
by
expounding
their
*NL*
own
opinions
better
than
they
could
themselves
.
Chelan
had
acted
as
*NL*
imprudently
for
Julien
as
he
had
for
himself
.
He
had
given
him
the
*NL*
habit
of
reasoning
correctly
,
and
of
not
being
put
off
by
empty
words
,
*NL*
but
he
had
neglected
to
tell
him
that
this
habit
was
a
crime
in
the
*NL*
person
of
no
importance
,
since
every
piece
of
logical
reasoning
is
*NL*
offensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
command
of
language
added
consequently
a
new
crime
to
his
*NL*
score
.
By
dint
of
thinking
about
him
,
his
colleagues
succeeded
in
*NL*
expressing
the
horror
with
which
he
would
inspire
them
by
a
single
*NL*
expression
;
they
nicknamed
him
Martin
Luther
,
``
particularly
,
''
they
*NL*
said
,
``
because
of
that
infernal
logic
which
makes
him
so
proud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
young
seminarists
had
a
fresher
complexion
than
Julien
,
and
*NL*
could
pass
as
better-looking
,
but
he
had
white
hands
,
and
was
unable
to
*NL*
conceal
certain
refined
habits
of
personal
cleanliness
.
This
advantage
*NL*
proved
a
disadvantage
in
the
gloomy
house
in
which
chance
had
cast
*NL*
him
.
The
dirty
peasants
among
whom
he
lived
asserted
that
he
had
very
*NL*
abandoned
morals
.
We
fear
that
we
may
weary
our
reader
by
a
narration
*NL*
of
the
thousand
and
one
misfortunes
of
our
hero
.
The
most
vigorous
of
*NL*
his
comrades
,
for
example
,
wanted
to
start
the
custom
of
beating
him
.
*NL*
He
was
obliged
to
arm
himself
with
an
iron
compass
,
and
to
indicate
,
*NL*
though
by
signs
,
that
he
would
make
use
of
it
.
Signs
can
not
figure
in
a
*NL*
spy
's
report
to
such
good
advantage
as
words
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
A
PROCESSION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
hearts
were
moved
.
The
presence
of
God
seemed
to
*NL*
have
descended
into
these
narrow
Gothic
streets
that
*NL*
stretched
in
every
direction
,
and
were
sanded
by
the
*NL*
care
of
the
faithful
.

Young

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
Julien
pretended
to
be
petty
and
stupid
.
He
could
*NL*
not
please
;
he
was
too
different
.
Yet
all
these
professors
,
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
are
very
clever
people
,
men
in
a
thousand
.
Why
do
they
not
*NL*
like
my
humility
?
Only
one
seemed
to
take
advantage
of
his
readiness
*NL*
to
believe
everything
,
and
apparently
to
swallow
everything
.
This
was
*NL*
the
abbe
Chas-Bernard
,
the
director
of
the
ceremonies
of
the
cathedral
,
*NL*
where
,
for
the
last
fifteen
years
,
he
had
been
given
occasion
to
hope
*NL*
for
a
canonry
.
While
waiting
,
he
taught
homiletics
at
the
seminary
.
*NL*
During
the
period
of
Julien
's
blindness
,
this
class
was
one
of
those
in
*NL*
which
he
most
frequently
came
out
top
.
The
abbe
Chas
had
used
this
as
*NL*
an
opportunity
to
manifest
some
friendship
to
him
,
and
when
the
class
*NL*
broke
up
,
he
would
be
glad
to
take
him
by
the
arm
for
some
turns
in
the
*NL*
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
he
getting
at
,
''
Julien
would
say
to
himself
.
He
noticed
*NL*
with
astonishment
that
,
for
hours
on
end
,
the
abbe
would
talk
to
him
*NL*
about
the
ornaments
possessed
by
the
cathedral
.
It
had
seventeen
lace
*NL*
chasubles
,
besides
the
mourning
vestments
.
A
lot
was
hoped
from
the
old
*NL*
wife
of
the
judge
de
Rubempre
.
This
lady
,
who
was
ninety
years
of
age
,
*NL*
had
kept
for
at
least
seventy
years
her
wedding
dress
of
superb
Lyons
*NL*
material
,
embroidered
with
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Imagine
,
my
friend
,
''
the
abbe
Chas
would
say
,
stopping
abruptly
,
and
*NL*
staring
with
amazement
,
``
that
this
material
keeps
quite
stiff
.
There
*NL*
is
so
much
gold
in
it
.
It
is
generally
thought
in
Besancon
that
the
*NL*
will
of
the
judge
's
wife
will
result
in
the
cathedral
treasure
being
*NL*
increased
by
more
than
ten
chasubles
,
without
counting
four
or
five
*NL*
capes
for
the
great
feast
.
I
will
go
further
,
''
said
the
abbe
Chas
,
*NL*
lowering
his
voice
,
``
I
have
reasons
for
thinking
the
judge
's
wife
will
*NL*
leave
us
her
magnificent
silver
gilt
candlesticks
,
supposed
to
have
*NL*
been
bought
in
Italy
by
Charles
the
Bold
,
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
whose
*NL*
favourite
minister
was
one
of
the
good
lady
's
ancestors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
the
fellow
getting
at
with
all
this
old
clothes
business
,
''
*NL*
thought
Julien
.
``
These
adroit
preliminaries
have
been
going
on
for
*NL*
centuries
,
and
nothing
comes
of
them
.
He
must
be
very
suspicious
of
me
.
*NL*
He
is
cleverer
than
all
the
others
,
whose
secret
aim
can
be
guessed
so
*NL*
easily
in
a
fortnight
.
I
understand
.
He
must
have
been
suffering
for
*NL*
fifteen
years
from
mortified
ambition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
summoned
one
evening
in
the
middle
of
the
fencing
lesson
to
*NL*
the
abbe
Pirard
,
who
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
is
the
feast
of
Corpus
Domini
-LRB-
the
Fete
Dieu
-RRB-
the
abbe
*NL*
Chas-Bernard
needs
you
to
help
him
to
decorate
the
cathedral
.
Go
and
*NL*
obey
.
''
The
abbe
Pirard
called
him
back
and
added
sympathetically
.
``
It
*NL*
depends
on
you
whether
you
will
utilise
the
occasion
to
go
into
the
*NL*
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Incedo
per
ignes
,
''
answered
Julien
.
-LRB-
I
have
secret
enemies
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
went
to
the
cathedral
next
morning
with
downcast
eyes
.
The
sight
*NL*
of
the
streets
and
the
activity
which
was
beginning
to
prevail
in
the
*NL*
town
did
him
good
.
In
all
quarters
they
were
extending
the
fronts
of
*NL*
the
houses
for
the
procession
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
that
he
had
passed
in
the
seminary
seemed
to
him
no
more
*NL*
than
a
moment
.
His
thoughts
were
of
Vergy
,
and
of
the
pretty
Amanda
*NL*
whom
he
might
perhaps
meet
,
for
her
cafe
was
not
very
far
off
.
He
saw
*NL*
in
the
distance
the
abbe
Chas-Bernard
on
the
threshold
of
his
beloved
*NL*
cathedral
.
He
was
a
big
man
with
a
jovial
face
and
a
frank
air
.
To-day
*NL*
he
looked
triumphant
.
``
I
was
expecting
you
,
my
dear
son
,
''
he
cried
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
saw
Julien
in
the
distance
.
``
Be
welcome
.
This
day
's
duty
*NL*
will
be
protracted
and
arduous
.
Let
us
fortify
ourselves
by
a
first
*NL*
breakfast
.
We
will
have
the
second
at
ten
o'clock
during
high
mass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
wish
,
sir
,
''
said
Julien
to
him
gravely
,
``
to
be
alone
for
a
*NL*
single
instant
.
Deign
to
observe
,
''
he
added
,
showing
him
the
clock
over
*NL*
their
heads
,
``
that
I
have
arrived
at
one
minute
to
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
those
little
rascals
at
the
seminary
frightened
you
.
It
is
very
*NL*
good
of
you
to
think
of
them
,
''
said
the
abbe
.
``
But
is
the
road
less
*NL*
beautiful
because
there
are
thorns
in
the
hedges
which
border
it
.
*NL*
Travellers
go
on
their
way
,
and
leave
the
wicked
thorns
to
wait
in
vain
*NL*
where
they
are
.
And
now
to
work
my
dear
friend
,
to
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
Chas
was
right
in
saying
that
the
task
would
be
arduous
.
There
*NL*
had
been
a
great
funeral
ceremony
at
the
cathedral
the
previous
day
.
*NL*
They
had
not
been
able
to
make
any
preparations
.
They
had
consequently
*NL*
only
one
morning
for
dressing
all
the
Gothic
pillars
which
constitute
*NL*
the
three
naves
with
a
kind
of
red
damask
cloth
ascending
to
a
height
*NL*
of
thirty
feet
.
The
Bishop
had
fetched
by
mail
four
decorators
from
*NL*
Paris
,
but
these
gentry
were
not
able
to
do
everything
,
and
far
from
*NL*
giving
any
encouragement
to
the
clumsiness
of
the
Besancon
colleagues
,
*NL*
they
made
it
twice
as
great
by
making
fun
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
saw
that
he
would
have
to
climb
the
ladder
himself
.
His
agility
*NL*
served
him
in
good
stead
.
He
undertook
the
direction
of
the
decorators
*NL*
from
town
.
The
Abbe
Chas
was
delighted
as
he
watched
him
flit
from
*NL*
ladder
to
ladder
.
When
all
the
pillars
were
dressed
in
damask
,
five
*NL*
enormous
bouquets
of
feathers
had
to
be
placed
on
the
great
baldachin
*NL*
above
the
grand
altar
.
A
rich
coping
of
gilded
wood
was
supported
by
*NL*
eight
big
straight
columns
of
Italian
marble
,
but
to
reach
the
centre
*NL*
of
the
baldachin
above
the
tabernacle
involved
walking
over
an
old
*NL*
wooden
cornice
which
was
forty
feet
high
and
possibly
worm-eaten
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
of
this
difficult
crossing
had
extinguished
the
gaiety
of
the
*NL*
Parisian
decorators
,
which
up
till
then
had
been
so
brilliant
.
They
*NL*
looked
at
it
from
down
below
,
argued
a
great
deal
,
but
did
not
go
up
.
*NL*
Julien
seized
hold
of
the
bouquets
of
feathers
and
climbed
the
ladder
*NL*
at
a
run
.
He
placed
it
neatly
on
the
crown-shaped
ornament
in
the
*NL*
centre
of
the
baldachin
.
When
he
came
down
the
ladder
again
,
the
abbe
*NL*
Chas-Bernard
embraced
him
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Optime
''
exclaimed
the
good
priest
,
``
I
will
tell
this
to
Monseigneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Breakfast
at
ten
o'clock
was
very
gay
.
The
abbe
Chas
had
never
seen
his
*NL*
church
look
so
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
disciple
,
''
he
said
to
Julien
.
``
My
mother
used
to
let
out
chairs
*NL*
in
this
venerable
building
,
so
I
have
been
brought
up
in
this
great
*NL*
edifice
.
The
Terror
of
Robespierre
ruined
us
,
but
when
I
was
eight
*NL*
years
old
,
that
was
my
age
then
,
I
used
to
serve
masses
in
private
*NL*
houses
,
so
you
see
I
got
my
meals
on
mass-days
.
Nobody
could
fold
a
*NL*
chasuble
better
than
I
could
,
and
I
never
cut
the
fringes
.
After
the
*NL*
re-establishment
of
public
worship
by
Napoleon
,
I
had
the
good
fortune
*NL*
to
direct
everything
in
this
venerable
metropolis
.
Five
times
a
year
do
*NL*
my
eyes
see
it
adorned
with
these
fine
ornaments
.
But
it
has
never
been
*NL*
so
resplendent
,
and
the
damask
breadths
have
never
been
so
well
tied
or
*NL*
so
close
to
the
pillars
as
they
are
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
he
is
going
to
tell
me
his
secret
at
last
,
''
said
Julien
.
``
Now
he
is
*NL*
going
to
talk
about
himself
.
He
is
expanding
.
''
But
nothing
imprudent
*NL*
was
said
by
the
man
in
spite
of
his
evident
exaltation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
he
has
worked
a
great
deal
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
*NL*
``
He
is
happy
.
What
a
man
!
What
an
example
for
me
!
He
really
takes
the
*NL*
cake
.
''
-LRB-
This
was
a
vulgar
phrase
which
he
had
learned
from
the
old
*NL*
surgeon
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
sanctus
of
high
mass
sounded
,
Julien
wanted
to
take
a
surplice
*NL*
to
follow
the
bishop
in
the
superb
procession
.
``
And
the
thieves
,
my
*NL*
friend
!
And
the
thieves
,
''
exclaimed
the
abbe
Chas
.
``
Have
you
forgotten
*NL*
them
?
The
procession
will
go
out
,
but
we
will
watch
,
will
you
and
I
.
*NL*
We
shall
be
very
lucky
if
we
get
off
with
the
loss
of
a
couple
of
ells
*NL*
of
this
fine
lace
which
surrounds
the
base
of
the
pillars
.
It
is
a
*NL*
gift
of
Madame
de
Rubempre
.
It
comes
from
her
great-grandfather
the
*NL*
famous
Count
.
It
is
made
of
real
gold
,
my
friend
,
''
added
the
abbe
in
*NL*
a
whisper
,
and
with
evident
exaltation
.
``
And
all
genuine
.
I
entrust
*NL*
you
with
the
watching
of
the
north
wing
.
Do
not
leave
it
.
I
will
keep
*NL*
the
south
wing
and
the
great
nave
for
myself
.
Keep
an
eye
on
the
*NL*
confessional
.
It
is
there
that
the
women
accomplices
of
the
thieves
*NL*
always
spy
.
Look
out
for
the
moment
when
we
turn
our
backs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
finished
speaking
,
a
quarter
to
twelve
struck
.
Immediately
*NL*
afterwards
the
sound
of
the
great
clock
was
heard
.
It
rang
a
full
peal
.
*NL*
These
full
solemn
sounds
affected
Julien
.
His
imagination
was
no
longer
*NL*
turned
to
things
earthly
.
The
perfume
of
the
incense
and
of
the
rose
*NL*
leaves
thrown
before
the
holy
sacrament
by
little
children
disguised
as
*NL*
St.
John
increased
his
exaltation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Logically
the
grave
sounds
of
the
bell
should
only
have
recalled
to
*NL*
Julien
's
mind
the
thought
of
the
labour
of
twenty
men
paid
fifty-four
*NL*
centimes
each
,
and
possibly
helped
by
fifteen
or
twenty
faithful
souls
.
*NL*
Logically
,
he
ought
to
have
thought
of
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
cords
*NL*
and
of
the
framework
and
of
the
danger
of
the
clock
itself
,
which
*NL*
falls
down
every
two
centuries
,
and
to
have
considered
the
means
of
*NL*
diminishing
the
salary
of
the
bell-ringers
,
or
of
paying
them
by
some
*NL*
indulgence
or
other
grace
dispensed
from
the
treasures
of
the
Church
*NL*
without
diminishing
its
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
soul
exalted
by
these
sounds
with
all
their
virile
fulness
,
*NL*
instead
of
making
these
wise
reflections
,
wandered
in
the
realm
*NL*
of
imagination
.
He
will
never
turn
out
a
good
priest
or
a
good
*NL*
administrator
.
Souls
which
get
thrilled
so
easily
are
at
the
best
*NL*
only
capable
of
producing
an
artist
.
At
this
moment
the
presumption
*NL*
of
Julien
bursts
out
into
full
view
.
Perhaps
fifty
of
his
comrades
*NL*
in
the
seminary
made
attentive
to
the
realities
of
life
by
their
own
*NL*
unpopularity
and
the
Jacobinism
which
they
are
taught
to
see
hiding
*NL*
behind
every
hedge
,
would
have
had
no
other
thought
suggested
by
the
*NL*
great
bell
of
the
cathedral
except
the
wages
of
the
ringers
.
They
would
*NL*
have
analysed
with
the
genius
of
Bareme
whether
the
intensity
of
the
*NL*
emotion
produced
among
the
public
was
worth
the
money
which
was
given
*NL*
to
the
ringers
.
If
Julien
had
only
tried
to
think
of
the
material
*NL*
interests
of
the
cathedral
,
his
imagination
would
have
transcended
its
*NL*
actual
object
and
thought
of
economizing
forty
francs
on
the
fabric
*NL*
and
have
lost
the
opportunity
of
avoiding
an
expense
of
twenty-five
*NL*
centimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
procession
slowly
traversed
Besancon
on
the
finest
day
*NL*
imaginable
,
and
stopped
at
the
brilliant
altar-stations
put
up
by
the
*NL*
authorities
,
the
church
remained
in
profound
silence
.
There
prevailed
a
*NL*
semi-obscurity
,
an
agreeable
freshness
.
It
was
still
perfumed
with
the
*NL*
fragrance
of
flowers
and
incense
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
,
the
deep
solitude
,
the
freshness
of
the
long
naves
*NL*
sweetened
Julien
's
reverie
.
He
did
not
fear
being
troubled
by
the
*NL*
abbe
Chas
,
who
was
engaged
in
another
part
of
the
building
.
His
soul
*NL*
had
almost
abandoned
its
mortal
tenement
,
which
was
pacing
slowly
the
*NL*
north
wing
which
had
been
trusted
to
his
surveillance
.
He
was
all
the
*NL*
more
tranquil
when
he
had
assured
himself
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
*NL*
confessional
except
some
devout
women
.
His
eyes
looked
in
front
of
him
*NL*
seeing
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
reverie
was
almost
broken
by
the
sight
of
two
well-dressed
women
,
*NL*
one
in
the
Confessional
,
and
the
other
on
a
chair
quite
near
her
.
He
*NL*
looked
without
seeing
,
but
noticed
,
however
,
either
by
reason
of
some
*NL*
vague
appreciation
of
his
duties
or
admiration
for
the
aristocratic
*NL*
but
simple
dress
of
the
ladies
,
that
there
was
no
priest
in
the
*NL*
Confessional
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
singular
,
''
he
thought
,
``
that
if
these
fair
ladies
are
devout
,
*NL*
they
are
not
kneeling
before
some
altar
,
or
that
if
they
are
in
society
*NL*
they
have
not
an
advantageous
position
in
the
first
row
of
some
*NL*
balcony
.
How
well
cut
that
dress
is
!
How
graceful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
slackened
his
pace
to
try
and
look
at
them
.
The
lady
who
was
*NL*
kneeling
in
the
Confessional
turned
her
head
a
little
hearing
the
noise
*NL*
of
Julien
's
step
in
this
solemn
place
.
Suddenly
she
gave
a
loud
cry
,
*NL*
and
felt
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
lady
collapsed
and
fell
backwards
on
her
knees
,
her
friend
who
*NL*
was
near
her
hastened
to
help
her
.
At
the
same
time
Julien
saw
the
*NL*
shoulders
of
the
lady
who
was
falling
backwards
.
His
eyes
were
struck
*NL*
by
a
twisted
necklace
of
fine
,
big
pearls
,
which
he
knew
well
.
What
*NL*
were
his
emotions
when
he
recognised
the
hair
of
Madame
de
Renal
?
It
*NL*
was
she
!
The
lady
who
was
trying
to
prevent
her
from
falling
was
Madame
*NL*
Derville
.
Julien
was
beside
himself
and
hastened
to
their
side
.
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
's
fall
would
perhaps
have
carried
her
friend
along
with
her
,
*NL*
if
Julien
had
not
supported
them
.
He
saw
the
head
of
Madame
de
Renal
,
*NL*
pale
and
entirely
devoid
of
consciousness
floating
on
his
shoulder
.
He
*NL*
helped
Madame
Derville
to
lean
that
charming
head
up
against
a
straw
*NL*
chair
.
He
knelt
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Derville
turned
round
and
recognised
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Away
,
monsieur
,
away
!
''
she
said
to
him
,
in
a
tone
of
the
most
lively
*NL*
anger
.
``
Above
all
,
do
not
let
her
see
you
again
.
The
sight
of
you
would
*NL*
be
sure
to
horrify
her
.
She
was
so
happy
before
you
came
.
Your
conduct
*NL*
is
atrocious
.
Flee
!
Take
yourself
off
if
you
have
any
shame
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
were
spoken
with
so
much
authority
,
and
Julien
felt
so
*NL*
weak
,
that
he
did
take
himself
off
.
``
She
always
hated
me
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
thinking
of
Madame
Derville
.
At
the
same
moment
the
nasal
*NL*
chanting
of
the
first
priests
in
the
procession
which
was
now
coming
*NL*
back
resounded
in
the
church
.
The
abbe
Chas-Bernard
called
Julien
,
who
*NL*
at
first
did
not
hear
him
,
several
times
.
He
came
at
last
and
took
his
*NL*
arm
behind
a
pillar
where
Julien
had
taken
refuge
more
dead
than
alive
.
*NL*
He
wanted
to
present
him
to
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
feeling
well
,
my
child
?
''
said
the
abbe
to
him
,
seeing
him
so
*NL*
pale
,
and
almost
incapable
of
walking
.
``
You
have
worked
too
much
.
''
The
*NL*
abbe
gave
him
his
arm
.
``
Come
,
sit
down
behind
me
here
,
on
the
little
*NL*
seat
of
the
dispenser
of
holy
water
;
I
will
hide
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
now
beside
the
main
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Calm
yourself
.
We
have
still
a
good
twenty
minutes
before
Monseigneur
*NL*
appears
.
Try
and
pull
yourself
together
.
I
will
lift
you
up
when
he
*NL*
passes
,
for
in
spite
of
my
age
,
I
am
strong
and
vigorous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
trembling
so
violently
when
the
Bishop
passed
,
that
the
abbe
*NL*
Chas
gave
up
the
idea
of
presenting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
take
it
too
much
to
heart
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
will
find
another
*NL*
opportunity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
evening
he
had
six
pounds
of
candles
which
had
been
saved
,
he
*NL*
said
,
by
Julien
's
carefulness
,
and
by
the
promptness
with
which
he
had
*NL*
extinguished
them
,
carried
to
the
seminary
chapel
.
Nothing
could
have
*NL*
been
nearer
the
truth
.
The
poor
boy
was
extinguished
himself
.
He
had
*NL*
not
had
a
single
thought
after
meeting
Madame
de
Renal
.

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
THE
FIRST
PROMOTION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
his
age
,
he
knew
his
department
,
and
he
is
rich
.
*NL*
_
The
Forerunner
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
not
emerged
from
the
deep
reverie
in
which
the
episode
in
*NL*
the
cathedral
had
plunged
him
,
when
the
severe
abbe
Pirard
summoned
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
the
abbe
Chas-Bernard
has
just
written
in
your
favour
.
I
am
on
*NL*
the
whole
sufficiently
satisfied
with
your
conduct
.
You
are
extremely
*NL*
imprudent
and
irresponsible
without
outward
signs
of
it
.
However
,
up
*NL*
to
the
present
,
you
have
proved
yourself
possessed
of
a
good
and
even
*NL*
generous
heart
.
Your
intellect
is
superior
.
Taking
it
all
round
,
I
see
*NL*
in
you
a
spark
which
one
must
not
neglect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
on
the
point
of
leaving
this
house
after
fifteen
years
of
work
.
*NL*
My
crime
is
that
I
have
left
the
seminarists
to
their
free
will
,
and
*NL*
that
I
have
neither
protected
nor
served
that
secret
society
of
which
*NL*
you
spoke
to
me
at
the
Confessional
.
I
wish
to
do
something
for
you
*NL*
before
I
leave
.
I
would
have
done
so
two
months
earlier
,
for
you
*NL*
deserve
it
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
information
laid
against
you
as
*NL*
the
result
of
the
finding
in
your
trunk
of
Amanda
Binet
's
address
.
I
*NL*
will
make
you
New
and
Old
Testament
tutor
.
Julien
was
transported
with
*NL*
gratitude
and
evolved
the
idea
of
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
and
*NL*
thanking
God
.
He
yielded
to
a
truer
impulse
,
and
approaching
the
abbe
*NL*
Pirard
,
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
''
exclaimed
the
director
angrily
,
but
*NL*
Julien
's
eyes
said
even
more
than
his
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
Pirard
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
,
after
the
manner
of
a
*NL*
man
who
has
long
lost
the
habit
of
encountering
refined
emotions
.
The
*NL*
attention
deceived
the
director
.
His
voice
altered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
yes
,
my
child
,
I
am
attached
to
you
.
Heaven
knows
that
I
have
*NL*
been
so
in
spite
of
myself
.
I
ought
to
show
neither
hate
nor
love
to
*NL*
anyone
.
I
see
in
you
something
which
offends
the
vulgar
.
Jealousy
and
*NL*
calumny
will
pursue
you
in
whatever
place
Providence
may
place
you
.
*NL*
Your
comrades
will
never
behold
you
without
hate
,
and
if
they
pretend
*NL*
to
like
you
,
it
will
only
be
to
betray
you
with
greater
certainty
.
For
*NL*
this
there
is
only
one
remedy
.
Seek
help
only
from
God
,
who
,
to
punish
*NL*
you
for
your
presumption
,
has
cursed
you
with
the
inevitable
hatred
*NL*
of
your
comrades
.
Let
your
conduct
be
pure
.
That
is
the
only
resource
*NL*
which
I
can
see
for
you
.
If
you
love
truth
with
an
irresistible
*NL*
embrace
,
your
enemies
will
sooner
or
later
be
confounded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
so
long
since
Julien
had
heard
a
friendly
voice
that
he
*NL*
must
be
forgiven
a
weakness
.
He
burst
out
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
Pirard
held
out
his
arms
to
him
.
This
moment
was
very
sweet
*NL*
to
both
of
them
.
Julien
was
mad
with
joy
.
This
promotion
was
the
first
*NL*
which
he
had
obtained
.
The
advantages
were
immense
.
To
realise
them
one
*NL*
must
have
been
condemned
to
pass
months
on
end
without
an
instant
's
*NL*
solitude
,
and
in
immediate
contact
with
comrades
who
were
at
the
best
*NL*
importunate
,
and
for
the
most
part
insupportable
.
Their
cries
alone
*NL*
would
have
sufficed
to
disorganise
a
delicate
constitution
.
The
noise
*NL*
and
joy
of
these
peasants
,
well-fed
and
well-clothed
as
they
were
,
*NL*
could
only
find
a
vent
for
itself
,
or
believe
in
its
own
completeness
*NL*
when
they
were
shouting
with
all
the
strength
of
their
lungs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Julien
dined
alone
,
or
nearly
an
hour
later
than
the
other
*NL*
seminarists
.
He
had
a
key
of
the
garden
and
could
walk
in
it
when
no
*NL*
one
else
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
astonished
to
perceive
that
he
was
now
hated
less
.
He
,
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
had
been
expecting
that
their
hate
would
become
twice
as
*NL*
intense
.
That
secret
desire
of
his
that
he
should
not
be
spoken
to
,
*NL*
which
had
been
only
too
manifest
before
,
and
had
earned
him
so
many
*NL*
enemies
,
was
no
longer
looked
upon
as
a
sign
of
ridiculous
haughtiness
.
*NL*
It
became
,
in
the
eyes
of
the
coarse
beings
who
surrounded
him
,
a
just
*NL*
appreciation
of
his
own
dignity
.
The
hatred
of
him
sensibly
diminished
,
*NL*
above
all
among
the
youngest
of
his
comrades
,
who
were
now
his
pupils
,
*NL*
and
whom
he
treated
with
much
politeness
.
Gradually
he
obtained
his
own
*NL*
following
.
It
became
looked
upon
as
bad
form
to
call
him
Martin
Luther
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
is
the
good
of
enumerating
his
friends
and
his
enemies
?
The
*NL*
whole
business
is
squalid
,
and
all
the
more
squalid
in
proportion
to
*NL*
the
truth
of
the
picture
.
And
yet
the
clergy
supply
the
only
teachers
*NL*
of
morals
which
the
people
have
.
What
would
happen
to
the
people
*NL*
without
them
?
Will
the
paper
ever
replace
the
cure
?
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Julien
's
new
dignity
,
the
director
of
the
seminary
made
a
point
*NL*
of
never
speaking
to
him
without
witnesses
.
These
tactics
were
prudent
,
*NL*
both
for
the
master
and
for
the
pupil
,
but
above
all
it
was
meant
for
*NL*
a
test
.
The
invariable
principle
of
that
severe
Jansenist
Pirard
was
*NL*
this
--
``
if
a
man
has
merit
in
your
eyes
,
put
obstacles
in
the
way
of
*NL*
all
he
desires
,
and
of
everything
which
he
undertakes
.
If
the
merit
is
*NL*
real
,
he
will
manage
to
overthrow
or
get
round
those
obstacles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
hunting
season
.
It
had
occurred
to
Fouque
to
send
a
stag
*NL*
and
a
boar
to
the
seminary
as
though
they
came
from
Julien
's
parents
.
*NL*
The
dead
animals
were
put
down
on
the
floor
between
the
kitchen
and
*NL*
the
refectory
.
It
was
there
that
they
were
seen
by
all
the
seminarists
*NL*
on
their
way
to
dinner
.
They
constituted
a
great
attraction
for
their
*NL*
curiosity
.
The
boar
,
dead
though
it
was
,
made
the
youngest
ones
feel
*NL*
frightened
.
They
touched
its
tusks
.
They
talked
of
nothing
else
for
a
*NL*
whole
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gift
,
which
raised
Julien
's
family
to
the
level
of
that
class
*NL*
of
society
which
deserves
respect
,
struck
a
deadly
blow
at
all
*NL*
jealousy
.
He
enjoyed
a
superiority
,
consecrated
by
fortune
.
Chazel
,
*NL*
the
most
distinguished
of
the
seminarists
,
made
advances
to
him
,
and
*NL*
always
reproached
him
for
not
having
previously
apprised
them
of
his
*NL*
parents
'
position
and
had
thus
involved
them
in
treating
money
without
*NL*
sufficient
respect
.
A
conscription
took
place
,
from
which
Julien
,
in
*NL*
his
capacity
as
seminarist
,
was
exempt
.
This
circumstance
affected
him
*NL*
profoundly
.
``
So
there
is
just
passed
for
ever
that
moment
which
,
twenty
*NL*
years
earlier
,
would
have
seen
my
heroic
life
begin
.
He
was
walking
*NL*
alone
in
the
seminary
garden
.
He
heard
the
masons
who
were
walling
up
*NL*
the
cloister
walls
talking
between
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
must
go
.
There
's
the
new
conscription
.
When
_
the
other
_
was
*NL*
alive
it
was
good
business
.
A
mason
could
become
an
officer
then
,
could
*NL*
become
a
general
then
.
One
has
seen
such
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
and
see
now
.
It
's
only
the
ragamuffins
who
leave
for
the
army
.
*NL*
Any
one
_
who
has
anything
_
stays
in
the
country
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
who
is
born
wretched
stays
wretched
,
and
there
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
is
it
true
what
they
say
,
that
the
other
is
dead
?
''
put
in
the
*NL*
third
mason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
,
it
's
the
'
_
big
men
_
'
who
say
that
,
you
see
.
The
other
one
*NL*
made
them
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
difference
.
How
the
fortification
went
ahead
in
his
time
.
And
*NL*
to
think
of
his
being
betrayed
by
his
own
marshals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
consoled
Julien
a
little
.
As
he
went
away
,
he
*NL*
repeated
with
a
sigh
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Le
seul
roi
dont
le
peuple
a
garde
la
memoire
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
for
the
examination
arrived
.
Julien
answered
brilliantly
.
He
*NL*
saw
that
Chazel
endeavoured
to
exhibit
all
his
knowledge
.
On
the
first
*NL*
day
the
examiners
,
nominated
by
the
famous
Grand
Vicar
de
Frilair
,
were
*NL*
very
irritated
at
always
having
to
put
first
,
or
at
any
rate
second
,
*NL*
on
their
list
,
that
Julien
Sorel
,
who
had
been
designated
to
them
as
*NL*
the
Benjamin
of
the
Abbe
Pirard
.
There
were
bets
in
the
seminary
that
*NL*
Julien
would
come
out
first
in
the
final
list
of
the
examination
,
a
*NL*
privilege
which
carried
with
it
the
honour
of
dining
with
my
Lord
*NL*
Bishop
.
But
at
the
end
of
a
sitting
,
dealing
with
the
fathers
of
the
*NL*
Church
,
an
adroit
examiner
,
having
first
interrogated
Julien
on
Saint
*NL*
Jerome
and
his
passion
for
Cicero
,
went
on
to
speak
about
Horace
,
*NL*
Virgil
and
other
profane
authors
.
Julien
had
learnt
by
heart
a
great
*NL*
number
of
passages
from
these
authors
without
his
comrades
'
knowledge
.
*NL*
Swept
away
by
his
successes
,
he
forgot
the
place
where
he
was
,
and
*NL*
recited
in
paraphrase
with
spirit
several
odes
of
Horace
at
the
*NL*
repeated
request
of
the
examiner
.
Having
for
twenty
minutes
given
him
*NL*
enough
rope
to
hang
himself
,
the
examiner
changed
his
expression
,
and
*NL*
bitterly
reproached
him
for
the
time
he
had
wasted
on
these
profane
*NL*
studies
,
and
the
useless
or
criminal
ideas
which
he
had
got
into
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
fool
,
sir
.
You
are
right
,
''
said
Julien
modestly
,
realising
the
*NL*
adroit
stratagem
of
which
he
was
the
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
examiner
's
dodge
was
considered
dirty
,
even
at
the
seminary
,
but
*NL*
this
did
not
prevent
the
abbe
de
Frilair
,
that
adroit
individual
who
*NL*
had
so
cleverly
organised
the
machinery
of
the
Besancon
congregation
,
*NL*
and
whose
despatches
to
Paris
put
fear
into
the
hearts
of
judges
,
*NL*
prefect
,
and
even
the
generals
of
the
garrison
,
from
placing
with
*NL*
his
powerful
hand
the
number
198
against
Julien
's
name
.
He
enjoyed
*NL*
subjecting
his
enemy
,
Pirard
the
Jansenist
,
to
this
mortification
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
chief
object
for
the
last
ten
years
had
been
to
deprive
him
of
the
*NL*
headship
of
the
seminary
.
The
abbe
,
who
had
himself
followed
the
plan
*NL*
which
he
had
indicated
to
Julien
,
was
sincere
,
pious
,
devoted
to
his
*NL*
duties
and
devoid
of
intrigue
,
but
heaven
in
its
anger
had
given
him
*NL*
that
bilious
temperament
which
is
by
nature
so
deeply
sensitive
to
*NL*
insults
and
to
hate
.
None
of
the
insults
which
were
addressed
to
him
*NL*
was
wasted
on
his
burning
soul
.
He
would
have
handed
in
his
resignation
*NL*
a
hundred
times
over
,
but
he
believed
that
he
was
useful
in
the
place
*NL*
where
Providence
had
set
him
.
``
I
prevent
the
progress
of
Jesuitism
and
*NL*
Idolatry
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
of
the
examinations
,
it
was
perhaps
nearly
two
months
*NL*
since
he
had
spoken
to
Julien
,
and
nevertheless
,
he
was
ill
for
eight
*NL*
days
when
,
on
receipt
of
the
official
letter
announcing
the
result
of
*NL*
the
competition
,
he
saw
the
number
198
placed
beside
the
name
of
that
*NL*
pupil
whom
he
regarded
as
the
glory
of
his
town
.
This
stern
character
*NL*
found
his
only
consolation
in
concentrating
all
his
surveillance
on
*NL*
Julien
.
He
was
delighted
that
he
discovered
in
him
neither
anger
,
nor
*NL*
vindictiveness
,
nor
discouragement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
felt
a
thrill
some
months
afterwards
when
he
received
a
letter
.
*NL*
It
bore
the
Paris
post-mark
.
Madame
de
Renal
is
remembering
her
*NL*
promises
at
last
,
he
thought
.
A
gentleman
who
signed
himself
Paul
*NL*
Sorel
,
and
who
said
that
he
was
his
relative
,
sent
him
a
letter
of
*NL*
credit
for
five
hundred
francs
.
The
writer
went
on
to
add
that
if
*NL*
Julien
went
on
to
study
successfully
the
good
Latin
authors
,
a
similar
*NL*
sum
would
be
sent
to
him
every
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
she
.
It
is
her
kindness
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
,
feeling
quite
*NL*
overcome
.
``
She
wishes
to
console
me
.
But
why
not
a
single
word
of
*NL*
affection
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
making
a
mistake
in
regard
to
this
letter
,
for
Madame
de
Renal
,
*NL*
under
the
influence
of
her
friend
,
Madame
Derville
,
was
abandoning
*NL*
herself
absolutely
to
profound
remorse
.
She
would
often
think
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
herself
,
of
that
singular
being
,
the
meeting
with
whom
had
*NL*
revolutionized
her
life
.
But
she
carefully
refrained
from
writing
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
were
to
talk
the
terminology
of
the
seminary
,
we
would
be
able
*NL*
to
recognise
a
miracle
in
the
sending
of
these
five
hundred
francs
and
*NL*
to
say
that
heaven
was
making
use
of
Monsieur
de
Frilair
himself
in
*NL*
order
to
give
this
gift
to
Julien
.
Twelve
years
previously
the
abbe
de
*NL*
Frilair
had
arrived
in
Besancon
with
an
extremely
exiguous
portmanteau
,
*NL*
which
,
according
to
the
story
,
contained
all
his
fortune
.
He
was
now
*NL*
one
of
the
richest
proprietors
of
the
department
.
In
the
course
of
his
*NL*
prosperity
,
he
had
bought
the
one
half
of
an
estate
,
while
the
other
*NL*
half
had
been
inherited
by
Monsieur
de
la
Mole
.
Consequently
there
was
*NL*
a
great
lawsuit
between
these
two
personages
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
le
Marquis
de
la
Mole
felt
that
,
in
spite
of
his
brilliant
life
at
*NL*
Paris
and
the
offices
which
he
held
at
Court
,
it
would
be
dangerous
to
*NL*
fight
at
Besancon
against
the
Grand
Vicar
,
who
was
reputed
to
make
and
*NL*
unmake
prefects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
soliciting
a
present
of
fifty
thousand
francs
which
could
*NL*
have
been
smuggled
into
the
budget
under
some
name
or
other
,
and
of
*NL*
throwing
up
this
miserable
lawsuit
with
the
abbe
Frilair
over
a
matter
*NL*
of
fifty
thousand
francs
,
the
marquis
lost
his
temper
.
He
thought
*NL*
he
was
in
the
right
,
absolutely
in
the
right
.
Moreover
,
if
one
is
*NL*
permitted
to
say
so
,
who
is
the
judge
who
has
not
got
a
son
,
or
at
any
*NL*
rate
a
cousin
to
push
in
the
world
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
enlighten
the
blindest
minds
the
abbe
de
Frilair
took
*NL*
the
carriage
of
my
Lord
the
Bishop
eight
days
after
the
first
decree
*NL*
which
he
obtained
,
and
went
himself
to
convey
the
cross
of
the
Legion
*NL*
of
Honour
to
his
advocate
.
M.
de
la
Mole
,
a
little
dumbfounded
at
*NL*
the
demeanour
of
the
other
side
,
and
appreciating
also
that
his
own
*NL*
advocates
were
slackening
their
efforts
,
asked
advice
of
the
abbe
*NL*
Chelan
,
who
put
him
in
communication
with
M.
Pirard
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
period
of
our
story
the
relations
between
these
two
men
had
*NL*
lasted
for
several
years
.
The
abbe
Pirard
imported
into
this
affair
*NL*
his
characteristic
passion
.
Being
in
constant
touch
with
the
Marquis
's
*NL*
advocates
,
he
studied
his
case
,
and
finding
it
just
,
he
became
quite
*NL*
openly
the
solicitor
of
M.
de
la
Mole
against
the
all-powerful
Grand
*NL*
Vicar
.
The
latter
felt
outraged
by
such
insolence
,
and
on
the
part
of
a
*NL*
little
Jansenist
into
the
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
what
this
Court
nobility
who
pretend
to
be
so
powerful
really
*NL*
are
,
''
would
say
the
abbe
de
Frilair
to
his
intimates
.
M.
de
la
Mole
has
*NL*
not
even
sent
a
miserable
cross
to
his
agent
at
Besancon
,
and
will
let
*NL*
him
be
tamely
turned
out
.
None
the
less
,
so
they
write
me
,
this
noble
*NL*
peer
never
lets
a
week
go
by
without
going
to
show
off
his
blue
ribbon
*NL*
in
the
drawing-room
of
the
Keeper
of
Seal
,
whoever
it
may
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
the
energy
of
the
abbe
Pirard
,
and
although
M.
de
la
*NL*
Mole
was
always
on
the
best
of
terms
with
the
minister
of
justice
,
and
*NL*
above
all
with
his
officials
,
the
best
that
he
could
achieve
after
six
*NL*
careful
years
was
not
to
lose
his
lawsuit
right
out
.
Being
as
he
was
*NL*
in
ceaseless
correspondence
with
the
abbe
Pirard
in
connection
with
an
*NL*
affair
in
which
they
were
both
passionately
interested
,
the
Marquis
*NL*
came
to
appreciate
the
abbe
's
particular
kind
of
intellect
.
Little
by
*NL*
little
,
and
in
spite
of
the
immense
distance
in
their
social
positions
,
*NL*
their
correspondence
assumed
the
tone
of
friendship
.
The
abbe
Pirard
*NL*
told
the
Marquis
that
they
wanted
to
heap
insults
upon
him
till
he
*NL*
should
be
forced
to
hand
in
his
resignation
.
In
his
anger
against
what
,
*NL*
in
his
opinion
,
was
the
infamous
stratagem
employed
against
Julien
,
he
*NL*
narrated
his
history
to
the
Marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
extremely
rich
,
this
great
lord
was
by
no
means
miserly
.
He
*NL*
had
never
been
able
to
prevail
on
the
abbe
Pirard
to
accept
even
the
*NL*
reimbursement
of
the
postal
expenses
occasioned
by
the
lawsuit
.
He
*NL*
seized
the
opportunity
of
sending
five
hundred
francs
to
his
favourite
*NL*
pupil
.
M.
de
la
Mole
himself
took
the
trouble
of
writing
the
covering
*NL*
letter
.
This
gave
the
abbe
food
for
thought
.
One
day
the
latter
*NL*
received
a
little
note
which
requested
him
to
go
immediately
on
an
*NL*
urgent
matter
to
an
inn
on
the
outskirts
of
Besancon
.
He
found
there
*NL*
the
steward
of
M.
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
le
Marquis
has
instructed
me
to
bring
you
his
carriage
,
''
said
the
*NL*
man
to
him
.
``
He
hopes
that
after
you
have
read
this
letter
you
will
*NL*
find
it
convenient
to
leave
for
Paris
in
four
or
five
days
.
I
will
*NL*
employ
the
time
in
the
meanwhile
in
asking
you
to
be
good
enough
to
*NL*
show
me
the
estates
of
M.
le
Marquis
in
the
Franche-Comte
,
so
that
I
*NL*
can
go
over
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
short
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rid
yourself
,
my
good
sir
,
of
all
the
chicanery
of
the
*NL*
provinces
and
come
and
breathe
the
peaceful
atmosphere
*NL*
of
Paris
.
I
send
you
my
carriage
which
has
orders
to
*NL*
await
your
decision
for
four
days
.
I
will
await
you
*NL*
myself
at
Paris
until
Tuesday
.
You
only
require
to
say
*NL*
so
,
monsieur
,
to
accept
in
your
own
name
one
of
the
best
*NL*
livings
in
the
environs
of
Paris
.
The
richest
of
your
*NL*
future
parishioners
has
never
seen
you
,
but
is
more
*NL*
devoted
than
you
can
possibly
think
:
he
is
the
Marquis
*NL*
de
la
Mole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
having
suspected
it
,
the
stern
abbe
Pirard
loved
this
seminary
,
*NL*
peopled
as
it
was
by
his
enemies
,
but
to
which
for
the
past
fifteen
*NL*
years
he
had
devoted
all
his
thoughts
.
M.
de
la
Mole
's
letter
had
*NL*
the
effect
on
him
of
the
visit
of
the
surgeon
come
to
perform
a
*NL*
difficult
but
necessary
operation
.
His
dismissal
was
certain
.
He
made
*NL*
an
appointment
with
the
steward
for
three
days
later
.
For
forty-eight
*NL*
hours
he
was
in
a
fever
of
uncertainty
.
Finally
he
wrote
to
the
M.
de
*NL*
la
Mole
,
and
composed
for
my
Lord
the
Bishop
a
letter
,
a
masterpiece
of
*NL*
ecclesiastical
style
,
although
it
was
a
little
long
;
it
would
have
been
*NL*
difficult
to
have
found
more
unimpeachable
phrases
,
and
ones
breathing
*NL*
a
more
sincere
respect
.
And
nevertheless
,
this
letter
,
intended
as
it
*NL*
was
to
get
M.
de
Frilair
into
trouble
with
his
patron
,
gave
utterance
*NL*
to
all
the
serious
matters
of
complaint
,
and
even
descended
to
the
*NL*
little
squalid
intrigues
which
,
having
been
endured
with
resignation
*NL*
for
six
years
,
were
forcing
the
abbe
Pirard
to
leave
the
diocese
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stole
his
firewood
,
they
poisoned
his
dog
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
finished
this
letter
he
had
Julien
called
.
Like
all
the
other
*NL*
seminarists
,
he
was
sleeping
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
where
the
Bishop
's
Palace
is
,
''
he
said
to
him
in
good
*NL*
classical
Latin
.
``
Take
this
letter
to
my
Lord
.
I
will
not
hide
from
*NL*
you
that
I
am
sending
you
into
the
midst
of
the
wolves
.
Be
all
ears
*NL*
and
eyes
.
Let
there
be
no
lies
in
your
answers
,
but
realise
that
the
*NL*
man
questioning
you
will
possibly
experience
a
real
joy
in
being
able
*NL*
to
hurt
you
.
I
am
very
pleased
,
my
child
,
at
being
able
to
give
you
*NL*
this
experience
before
I
leave
you
,
for
I
do
not
hide
from
you
that
the
*NL*
letter
which
you
are
bearing
is
my
resignation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
stood
motionless
.
He
loved
the
abbe
Pirard
.
It
was
in
vain
that
*NL*
prudence
said
to
him
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
this
honest
man
's
departure
the
Sacre-Coeur
party
will
disgrace
*NL*
me
and
perhaps
expel
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
think
of
himself
.
He
was
embarrassed
by
a
phrase
which
he
*NL*
was
trying
to
turn
in
a
polite
way
,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
found
*NL*
himself
without
the
brains
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
friend
,
are
you
not
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
because
they
say
,
monsieur
,
''
answered
Julian
timidly
,
``
that
you
*NL*
have
put
nothing
on
one
side
during
your
long
administration
.
I
have
*NL*
six
hundred
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
tears
prevented
him
from
continuing
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
That
also
will
be
noticed
,
_
''
said
the
ex-director
of
the
seminary
*NL*
coldly
.
``
Go
to
the
Palace
.
It
is
getting
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chance
would
so
have
it
that
on
that
evening
,
the
abbe
de
Frilair
*NL*
was
on
duty
in
the
salon
of
the
Palace
.
My
lord
was
dining
with
the
*NL*
prefect
,
so
it
was
to
M.
de
Frilair
himself
that
Julien
,
though
he
did
*NL*
not
know
it
,
handed
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
astonished
to
see
this
abbe
boldly
open
the
letter
which
was
*NL*
addressed
to
the
Bishop
.
The
face
of
the
Grand
Vicar
soon
expressed
*NL*
surprise
,
tinged
with
a
lively
pleasure
,
and
became
twice
as
grave
*NL*
as
before
.
Julien
,
struck
with
his
good
appearance
,
found
time
to
*NL*
scrutinise
him
while
he
was
reading
.
This
face
would
have
possessed
*NL*
more
dignity
had
it
not
been
for
the
extreme
subtlety
which
appeared
*NL*
in
some
features
,
and
would
have
gone
to
the
fact
of
actually
denoting
*NL*
falseness
if
the
possessor
of
this
fine
countenance
had
ceased
*NL*
to
school
it
for
a
single
minute
.
The
very
prominent
nose
formed
*NL*
a
perfectly
straight
line
and
unfortunately
gave
to
an
otherwise
*NL*
distinguished
profile
,
a
curious
resemblance
to
the
physiognomy
of
*NL*
a
fox
.
Otherwise
this
abbe
,
who
appeared
so
engrossed
with
Monsieur
*NL*
Pirard
's
resignation
,
was
dressed
with
an
elegance
which
Julien
had
*NL*
never
seen
before
in
any
priest
and
which
pleased
him
exceedingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
later
that
Julien
knew
in
what
the
special
talent
of
the
*NL*
abbe
de
Frilair
really
consisted
.
He
knew
how
to
amuse
his
bishop
,
*NL*
an
amiable
old
man
made
for
Paris
life
,
and
who
looked
upon
Besancon
*NL*
as
exile
.
This
Bishop
had
very
bad
sight
,
and
was
passionately
fond
*NL*
of
fish
.
The
abbe
de
Frilair
used
to
take
the
bones
out
of
the
fish
*NL*
which
was
served
to
my
Lord
.
Julien
looked
silently
at
the
abbe
who
*NL*
was
rereading
the
resignation
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
with
a
*NL*
noise
.
A
richly
dressed
lackey
passed
in
rapidly
.
Julien
had
only
*NL*
time
to
turn
round
towards
the
door
.
He
perceived
a
little
old
man
*NL*
wearing
a
pectoral
cross
.
He
prostrated
himself
.
The
Bishop
addressed
a
*NL*
benevolent
smile
to
him
and
passed
on
.
The
handsome
abbe
followed
him
*NL*
and
Julien
was
left
alone
in
the
salon
,
and
was
able
to
admire
at
his
*NL*
leisure
its
pious
magnificence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
of
Besancon
,
a
man
whose
spirit
had
been
tried
but
*NL*
not
broken
by
the
long
miseries
of
the
emigration
,
was
more
than
*NL*
seventy-five
years
old
and
concerned
himself
infinitely
little
with
*NL*
what
might
happen
in
ten
years
'
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
clever-looking
seminarist
I
think
I
saw
as
I
passed
?
''
said
*NL*
the
Bishop
.
``
Ought
n't
they
to
be
in
bed
according
to
my
regulations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
one
is
very
wide-awake
I
assure
you
,
my
Lord
,
and
he
brings
*NL*
great
news
.
It
is
the
resignation
of
the
only
Jansenist
residing
in
*NL*
your
diocese
,
that
terrible
abbe
Pirard
realises
at
last
that
we
mean
*NL*
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
Bishop
with
a
laugh
.
``
I
challenge
you
to
replace
him
*NL*
with
any
man
of
equal
worth
,
and
to
show
you
how
much
I
prize
that
man
,
*NL*
I
will
invite
him
to
dinner
for
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Grand
Vicar
tried
to
slide
in
a
few
words
concerning
the
choice
of
*NL*
a
successor
.
The
prelate
,
who
was
little
disposed
to
talk
business
,
*NL*
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
we
install
the
other
,
let
us
get
to
know
a
little
of
the
*NL*
circumstances
under
which
the
present
one
is
going
.
Fetch
me
this
*NL*
seminarist
.
The
truth
is
in
the
mouth
of
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
summoned
.
``
I
shall
find
myself
between
two
inquisitors
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
.
He
had
never
felt
more
courageous
.
At
the
moment
when
he
*NL*
entered
,
two
valets
,
better
dressed
than
M.
Valenod
himself
,
were
*NL*
undressing
my
lord
.
That
prelate
thought
he
ought
to
question
Julien
*NL*
on
his
studies
before
questioning
him
about
M.
Pirard
.
He
talked
a
*NL*
little
theology
,
and
was
astonished
.
He
soon
came
to
the
humanities
,
*NL*
to
Virgil
,
to
Horace
,
to
Cicero
.
``
It
was
those
names
,
''
thought
Julien
,
*NL*
that
earned
me
my
number
198
.
I
have
nothing
to
lose
.
Let
us
try
*NL*
and
shine
.
He
succeeded
.
The
prelate
,
who
was
an
excellent
humanist
*NL*
himself
,
was
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
prefect
's
dinner
,
a
young
girl
who
was
justly
celebrated
,
*NL*
had
recited
the
poem
of
the
Madeleine
.
He
was
in
the
mood
to
talk
*NL*
literature
,
and
very
quickly
forgot
the
abbe
Pirard
and
his
affairs
*NL*
to
discuss
with
the
seminarist
whether
Horace
was
rich
or
poor
.
The
*NL*
prelate
quoted
several
odes
,
but
sometimes
his
memory
was
sluggish
,
*NL*
and
then
Julien
would
recite
with
modesty
the
whole
ode
:
the
fact
*NL*
which
struck
the
bishop
was
that
Julien
never
deviated
from
the
*NL*
conversational
tone
.
He
spoke
his
twenty
or
thirty
Latin
verses
as
*NL*
though
he
had
been
speaking
of
what
was
taking
place
in
his
own
*NL*
seminary
.
They
talked
for
a
long
time
of
Virgil
,
or
Cicero
,
and
the
*NL*
prelate
could
not
help
complimenting
the
young
seminarist
.
``
You
could
*NL*
not
have
studied
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord
,
''
said
Julien
,
``
your
seminary
can
offer
you
197
much
less
*NL*
unworthy
of
your
high
esteem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
?
''
said
the
Prelate
astonished
by
the
number
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
support
by
official
proof
just
what
I
have
had
the
honour
of
*NL*
saying
before
my
lord
.
I
obtained
the
number
198
at
the
seminary
's
*NL*
annual
examination
by
giving
accurate
answers
to
the
very
questions
*NL*
which
are
earning
me
at
the
present
moment
my
lord
's
approbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
is
the
Benjamin
of
the
abbe
Pirard
,
''
said
the
Bishop
with
a
*NL*
laugh
,
as
he
looked
at
M.
de
Frilair
.
``
We
should
have
been
prepared
*NL*
for
this
.
But
it
is
fair
fighting
.
Did
you
not
have
to
be
woken
up
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
himself
to
Julien
.
``
To
be
sent
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
Lord
.
I
have
only
been
out
of
the
seminary
alone
once
in
my
*NL*
life
to
go
and
help
M.
the
abbe
Chas-Bernard
decorate
the
cathedral
on
*NL*
Corpus
Christi
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Optime
,
''
said
the
Bishop
.
``
So
,
it
is
you
who
showed
proof
of
so
much
*NL*
courage
by
placing
the
bouquets
of
feathers
on
the
baldachin
.
They
*NL*
make
me
shudder
.
They
make
me
fear
that
they
will
cost
some
man
his
*NL*
life
.
You
will
go
far
,
my
friend
,
but
I
do
not
wish
to
cut
short
your
*NL*
brilliant
career
by
making
you
die
of
hunger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
by
the
order
of
the
Bishop
,
biscuits
and
wine
were
brought
in
,
to
*NL*
which
Julien
did
honour
,
and
the
abbe
de
Frilair
,
who
knew
that
his
*NL*
Bishop
liked
to
see
people
eat
gaily
and
with
a
good
appetite
,
even
*NL*
greater
honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prelate
,
more
and
more
satisfied
with
the
end
of
his
evening
,
*NL*
talked
for
a
moment
of
ecclesiastical
history
.
He
saw
that
Julien
did
*NL*
not
understand
.
The
prelate
passed
on
to
the
moral
condition
of
the
*NL*
Roman
Empire
under
the
system
of
the
Emperor
Constantine
.
The
end
of
*NL*
paganism
had
been
accompanied
by
that
state
of
anxiety
and
of
doubt
*NL*
which
afflicts
sad
and
jaded
spirits
in
the
nineteenth
century
.
My
Lord
*NL*
noticed
Julien
's
ignorance
of
almost
the
very
name
of
Tacitus
.
To
the
*NL*
astonishment
of
the
prelate
,
Julien
answered
frankly
that
that
author
*NL*
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
seminary
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
truly
very
glad
,
''
said
the
Bishop
gaily
,
``
You
relieve
me
of
an
*NL*
embarrassment
.
I
have
been
trying
for
the
last
five
minutes
to
find
a
*NL*
way
of
thanking
you
for
the
charming
evening
which
you
have
given
me
in
*NL*
a
way
that
I
could
certainly
never
have
expected
.
I
did
not
anticipate
*NL*
finding
a
teacher
in
a
pupil
in
my
seminary
.
Although
the
gift
is
not
*NL*
unduly
canonical
,
I
want
to
give
you
a
Tacitus
.
''
The
prelate
had
eight
*NL*
volumes
in
a
superior
binding
fetched
for
him
,
and
insisted
on
writing
*NL*
himself
on
the
title
page
of
the
first
volume
a
Latin
compliment
to
*NL*
Julien
Sorel
.
The
Bishop
plumed
himself
on
his
fine
Latinity
.
He
*NL*
finished
by
saying
to
him
in
a
serious
tone
,
which
completely
clashed
*NL*
with
the
rest
of
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
man
,
if
you
are
good
,
you
will
have
one
day
the
best
living
in
*NL*
my
diocese
,
and
one
not
a
hundred
leagues
from
my
episcopal
palace
,
but
*NL*
you
must
be
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laden
with
his
volumes
,
Julien
left
the
palace
in
a
state
of
great
*NL*
astonishment
as
midnight
was
striking
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lord
had
not
said
a
word
to
him
about
the
abbe
Pirard
.
Julien
was
*NL*
particularly
astonished
by
the
Bishop
's
extreme
politeness
.
He
had
had
*NL*
no
conception
of
such
an
urbanity
in
form
combined
with
so
natural
an
*NL*
air
of
dignity
.
Julien
was
especially
struck
by
the
contrast
on
seeing
*NL*
again
the
gloomy
abbe
Pirard
,
who
was
impatiently
awaiting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quid
tibi
dixerunt
-LRB-
What
have
they
said
to
you
-RRB-
?
''
he
cried
out
to
him
*NL*
in
a
loud
voice
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
in
the
distance
.
``
Speak
French
,
*NL*
and
repeat
my
Lord
's
own
words
without
either
adding
or
subtracting
*NL*
anything
,
''
said
the
ex-Director
of
the
seminary
in
his
harsh
tone
,
*NL*
and
with
his
particularly
inelegant
manners
,
as
Julien
got
slightly
*NL*
confused
in
translating
into
Latin
the
speeches
of
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
strange
present
on
the
part
of
the
Bishop
to
a
young
*NL*
seminarist
,
''
he
ventured
to
say
as
he
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
*NL*
superb
Tacitus
,
whose
gilt
edges
seemed
to
horrify
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
o'clock
was
already
striking
when
he
allowed
his
favourite
pupil
to
*NL*
retire
to
his
room
after
an
extremely
detailed
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
the
first
volume
of
your
Tacitus
,
''
he
said
to
him
.
``
Where
*NL*
is
my
Lord
Bishop
's
compliment
?
This
Latin
line
will
serve
as
your
*NL*
lightning-conductor
in
this
house
after
my
departure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Erit
tibi
,
fili
mi
,
successor
meus
tanquam
leo
querens
quem
devoret
.
*NL*
-LRB-
For
my
successor
will
be
to
you
,
my
son
,
like
a
ravening
lion
seeking
*NL*
someone
to
devour
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
morning
Julien
noticed
a
certain
strangeness
in
*NL*
the
manner
in
which
his
comrades
spoke
to
him
.
It
only
made
him
*NL*
more
reserved
.
``
This
,
''
he
thought
,
``
is
the
result
of
M.
Pirard
's
*NL*
resignation
.
It
is
known
over
the
whole
house
,
and
I
pass
for
his
*NL*
favourite
.
There
ought
logically
to
be
an
insult
in
their
demeanour
.
''
*NL*
But
he
could
not
detect
it
.
On
the
contrary
,
there
was
an
absence
of
*NL*
hate
in
the
eyes
of
all
those
he
met
along
the
corridors
.
``
What
is
the
*NL*
meaning
of
this
?
It
is
doubtless
a
trap
.
Let
us
play
a
wary
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
the
little
seminarist
said
to
him
with
a
laugh
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cornelii
Taciti
opera
omnia
-LRB-
complete
works
of
Tacitus
-RRB-
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
these
words
,
they
all
congratulated
Julien
enviously
,
not
*NL*
only
on
the
magnificent
present
which
he
had
received
from
my
lord
,
but
*NL*
also
on
the
two
hours
'
conversation
with
which
he
had
been
honoured
.
*NL*
They
knew
even
its
minutest
details
.
From
that
moment
envy
ceased
*NL*
completely
.
They
courted
him
basely
.
The
abbe
Castanede
,
who
had
*NL*
manifested
towards
him
the
most
extreme
insolence
the
very
day
before
,
*NL*
came
and
took
his
arm
and
invited
him
to
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
some
fatality
in
Julien
's
character
,
while
the
insolence
of
these
*NL*
coarse
creatures
had
occasioned
him
great
pain
,
their
baseness
afforded
*NL*
him
disgust
,
but
no
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
mid-day
the
abbe
Pirard
took
leave
of
his
pupils
,
but
not
*NL*
before
addressing
to
them
a
severe
admonition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
for
the
honours
of
the
world
,
''
he
said
to
them
.
``
For
all
*NL*
the
social
advantages
,
for
the
pleasure
of
commanding
pleasures
,
of
*NL*
setting
the
laws
at
defiance
,
and
the
pleasure
of
being
insolent
with
*NL*
impunity
to
all
?
Or
do
you
wish
for
your
eternal
salvation
?
The
most
*NL*
backward
of
you
have
only
got
to
open
your
eyes
to
distinguish
the
true
*NL*
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
scarcely
left
before
the
devotees
of
the
_
Sacre
Coeur
de
Jesus
_
*NL*
went
into
the
chapel
to
intone
a
Te
Deum
.
Nobody
in
the
seminary
took
*NL*
the
ex-director
's
admonition
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
shows
a
great
deal
of
temper
because
he
is
losing
his
job
,
''
was
*NL*
what
was
said
in
every
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
single
seminarist
was
simple
enough
to
believe
in
the
voluntary
*NL*
resignation
of
a
position
which
put
him
into
such
close
touch
with
the
*NL*
big
contractors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
Pirard
went
and
established
himself
in
the
finest
inn
at
*NL*
Besancon
,
and
making
an
excuse
of
business
which
he
had
not
got
,
*NL*
insisted
on
passing
a
couple
of
days
there
.
The
Bishop
had
invited
*NL*
him
to
dinner
,
and
in
order
to
chaff
his
Grand
Vicar
de
Frilair
,
*NL*
endeavoured
to
make
him
shine
.
They
were
at
dessert
when
the
*NL*
extraordinary
intelligence
arrived
from
Paris
that
the
abbe
Pirard
had
*NL*
been
appointed
to
the
magnificent
living
of
N.
--
four
leagues
from
*NL*
Paris
.
The
good
prelate
congratulated
him
upon
it
.
He
saw
in
the
whole
*NL*
affair
a
piece
of
good
play
which
put
him
in
a
good
temper
and
gave
him
*NL*
the
highest
opinion
of
the
abbe
's
talents
.
He
gave
him
a
magnificent
*NL*
Latin
certificate
,
and
enjoined
silence
on
the
abbe
de
Frilair
,
who
was
*NL*
venturing
to
remonstrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
evening
,
my
Lord
conveyed
his
admiration
to
the
Marquise
de
*NL*
Rubempre
.
This
was
great
news
for
fine
Besancon
society
.
They
abandoned
*NL*
themselves
to
all
kinds
of
conjectures
over
this
extraordinary
favour
.
*NL*
They
already
saw
the
abbe
Pirard
a
Bishop
.
The
more
subtle
brains
*NL*
thought
M.
de
la
Mole
was
a
minister
,
and
indulged
on
this
day
in
*NL*
smiles
at
the
imperious
airs
that
M.
the
abbe
de
Frilair
adopted
in
*NL*
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
day
the
abbe
Pirard
was
almost
mobbed
in
the
streets
,
*NL*
and
the
tradesmen
came
to
their
shop
doors
when
he
went
to
solicit
an
*NL*
interview
with
the
judges
who
had
had
to
try
the
Marquis
's
lawsuit
.
For
*NL*
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
politely
received
by
them
.
The
stern
*NL*
Jansenist
,
indignant
as
he
was
with
all
that
he
saw
,
worked
long
with
*NL*
the
advocates
whom
he
had
chosen
for
the
Marquis
de
la
Mole
,
and
left
*NL*
for
Paris
.
He
was
weak
enough
to
tell
two
or
three
college
friends
who
*NL*
accompanied
him
to
the
carriage
whose
armorial
bearings
they
admired
,
*NL*
that
after
having
administered
the
Seminary
for
fifteen
years
he
was
*NL*
leaving
Besancon
with
five
hundred
and
twenty
francs
of
savings
.
His
*NL*
friends
kissed
him
with
tears
in
their
eyes
,
and
said
to
each
other
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
good
abbe
could
have
spared
himself
that
lie
.
It
is
really
too
*NL*
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
vulgar
,
blinded
as
they
are
by
the
love
of
money
,
were
*NL*
constitutionally
incapable
of
understanding
that
it
was
in
his
own
*NL*
sincerity
that
the
abbe
Pirard
had
found
the
necessary
strength
to
*NL*
fight
for
six
years
against
Marie
Alacoque
,
the
_
Sacre
Coeur
de
Jesus
_
,
*NL*
the
Jesuits
and
his
Bishop

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
AN
AMBITIOUS
MAN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
only
one
nobility
,
the
title
of
duke
;
a
marquis
is
*NL*
ridiculous
;
the
word
duke
makes
one
turn
round
.
*NL*
_
Edinburgh
Review
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Marquis
de
la
Mole
received
the
abbe
Pirard
without
any
of
those
*NL*
aristocratic
mannerisms
whose
very
politeness
is
at
the
same
time
so
*NL*
impertinent
to
one
who
understands
them
.
It
would
have
been
a
waste
of
*NL*
time
,
and
the
Marquis
was
sufficiently
expeditious
in
big
affairs
to
*NL*
have
no
time
to
lose
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
intriguing
for
six
months
to
get
both
the
king
and
people
*NL*
to
accept
a
minister
who
,
as
a
matter
of
gratitude
,
was
to
make
him
a
*NL*
Duke
.
The
Marquis
had
been
asking
his
Besancon
advocate
for
years
on
*NL*
end
for
a
clear
and
precise
summary
of
his
Franche-Comte
lawsuits
.
How
*NL*
could
the
celebrated
advocate
explain
to
him
what
he
did
not
understand
*NL*
himself
?
The
little
square
of
paper
which
the
abbe
handed
him
explained
*NL*
the
whole
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
abbe
,
''
said
the
Marquis
to
him
,
having
got
through
in
less
*NL*
than
five
minutes
all
polite
formulae
of
personal
questions
.
``
My
dear
*NL*
abbe
,
in
the
midst
of
my
pretended
prosperity
I
lack
the
time
to
occupy
*NL*
myself
seriously
with
two
little
matters
which
are
rather
important
,
*NL*
my
family
and
my
affairs
.
I
manage
the
fortune
of
my
house
on
a
large
*NL*
scale
.
I
can
carry
it
far
.
I
manage
my
pleasures
,
and
that
is
the
first
*NL*
consideration
in
my
eyes
,
''
he
added
,
as
he
saw
a
look
of
astonishment
*NL*
in
the
abbe
Pirard
's
eyes
.
Although
a
man
of
common
sense
,
the
abbe
was
*NL*
surprised
to
hear
a
man
talk
so
frankly
about
his
pleasures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Work
doubtless
exists
in
Paris
,
''
continued
the
great
lord
,
``
but
it
is
*NL*
perched
on
the
fifth
story
,
and
as
soon
as
I
take
anyone
up
,
he
takes
*NL*
an
apartment
on
the
second
floor
,
and
his
wife
starts
a
day
at
home
;
*NL*
the
result
is
no
more
work
and
no
more
efforts
except
either
to
be
,
or
*NL*
appear
to
be
,
a
society
man
.
That
is
the
only
thing
they
bother
about
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
they
have
got
their
bread
and
butter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
lawsuits
,
yes
,
for
every
single
one
of
them
,
I
have
,
to
put
it
*NL*
plainly
,
advocates
who
quarrel
to
death
.
One
died
of
consumption
the
*NL*
day
before
yesterday
.
Taking
my
business
all
round
,
would
you
believe
,
*NL*
monsieur
,
that
for
three
years
I
have
given
up
all
hope
of
finding
a
*NL*
man
who
deigns
,
during
the
time
he
is
acting
as
my
clerk
,
to
give
a
*NL*
little
serious
thought
to
what
he
is
doing
.
Besides
,
all
this
is
only
a
*NL*
preliminary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
respect
you
and
would
venture
to
add
that
,
although
I
only
see
you
*NL*
for
the
first
time
to-day
,
I
like
you
.
Will
you
be
my
secretary
at
a
*NL*
salary
of
eight
hundred
francs
or
even
double
.
I
shall
still
be
the
*NL*
gainer
by
it
,
I
swear
to
you
,
and
I
will
manage
to
reserve
that
fine
*NL*
living
for
you
for
the
day
when
we
shall
no
longer
be
able
to
agree
.
''
*NL*
The
abbe
refused
,
but
the
genuine
embarrassment
in
which
he
saw
the
*NL*
Marquis
suggested
an
idea
to
him
towards
the
end
of
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
left
in
the
depths
of
my
seminary
a
poor
young
man
who
,
if
I
*NL*
mistake
not
,
will
be
harshly
persecuted
.
If
he
were
only
a
simple
monk
*NL*
he
would
be
already
_
in
pace
_
.
So
far
this
young
man
only
knows
Latin
*NL*
and
the
Holy
Scriptures
,
but
it
is
not
impossible
that
he
will
one
day
*NL*
exhibit
great
talent
,
either
for
preaching
or
the
guiding
of
souls
.
I
*NL*
do
not
know
what
he
will
do
,
but
he
has
the
sacred
fire
.
He
may
go
far
.
*NL*
I
thought
of
giving
him
to
our
Bishop
,
if
we
had
ever
had
one
who
was
a
*NL*
little
of
your
way
of
considering
men
and
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
young
man
's
extraction
?
''
said
the
Marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
said
to
be
the
son
of
a
carpenter
in
our
mountains
.
I
rather
*NL*
believe
he
is
the
natural
son
of
some
rich
man
.
I
have
seen
him
receive
*NL*
an
anonymous
or
pseudonymous
letter
with
a
bill
for
five
hundred
*NL*
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
Julien
Sorel
,
''
said
the
Marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
his
name
?
''
said
the
abbe
,
in
astonishment
,
reddening
*NL*
at
his
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
'm
not
going
to
tell
you
,
''
answered
the
Marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
replied
the
abbe
,
``
you
might
try
making
him
your
secretary
.
He
*NL*
has
energy
.
He
has
a
logical
mind
.
In
a
word
,
it
's
worth
trying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
said
the
Marquis
.
``
But
would
he
be
the
kind
of
man
to
allow
*NL*
his
palm
to
be
greased
by
the
Prefect
of
Police
or
any
one
else
and
*NL*
then
spy
on
me
?
That
is
only
my
objection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
hearing
the
favourable
assurances
of
the
abbe
Pirard
,
the
Marquis
*NL*
took
a
thousand
franc
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
this
journey
money
to
Julien
Sorel
.
Let
him
come
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
sees
at
once
,
''
said
the
abbe
Pirard
,
``
that
you
live
in
Paris
.
*NL*
You
do
not
know
the
tyranny
which
weighs
us
poor
provincials
down
,
*NL*
and
particularly
those
priests
who
are
not
friendly
to
the
Jesuits
.
*NL*
They
will
refuse
to
let
Julien
Sorel
leave
.
They
will
manage
to
cloak
*NL*
themselves
in
the
most
clever
excuses
.
They
will
answer
me
that
he
is
*NL*
ill
,
that
his
letters
were
lost
in
the
post
,
etc.
,
etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
get
a
letter
from
the
minister
to
the
Bishop
,
one
of
these
*NL*
days
,
''
answered
the
Marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
forgetting
to
warn
you
of
one
thing
,
''
said
the
abbe
.
``
This
young
*NL*
man
,
though
of
low
birth
,
has
a
high
spirit
.
He
will
be
of
no
use
if
*NL*
you
madden
his
pride
.
You
will
make
him
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
pleases
me
,
''
said
the
Marquis
.
``
I
will
make
him
my
son
's
comrade
.
*NL*
Will
that
be
enough
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
afterwards
,
Julien
received
a
letter
in
an
unknown
writing
,
*NL*
and
bearing
the
Chelon
postmark
.
He
found
in
it
a
draft
on
a
Besancon
*NL*
merchant
,
and
instructions
to
present
himself
at
Paris
without
delay
.
*NL*
The
letter
was
signed
in
a
fictitious
name
,
but
Julien
had
felt
a
*NL*
thrill
in
opening
it
.
A
leaf
of
a
tree
had
fallen
down
at
his
feet
.
It
*NL*
was
the
agreed
signal
between
himself
and
the
abbe
Pirard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
an
hour
's
time
,
Julien
was
summoned
to
the
Bishop
's
Palace
,
*NL*
where
he
found
himself
welcomed
with
a
quite
paternal
benevolence
.
My
*NL*
lord
quoted
Horace
and
at
the
same
time
complimented
him
very
adroitly
*NL*
on
the
exalted
destiny
which
awaited
him
in
Paris
in
such
a
way
as
*NL*
to
elicit
an
explanation
by
way
of
thanks
.
Julien
was
unable
to
say
*NL*
anything
,
simply
because
he
did
not
know
anything
,
and
my
Lord
showed
*NL*
him
much
consideration
.
One
of
the
little
priests
in
the
bishopric
*NL*
wrote
to
the
mayor
,
who
hastened
to
bring
in
person
a
signed
passport
,
*NL*
where
the
name
of
the
traveller
had
been
left
in
blank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
midnight
of
the
same
evening
,
Julien
was
at
Fouque
's
.
His
*NL*
friend
's
shrewd
mind
was
more
astonished
than
pleased
with
the
future
*NL*
which
seemed
to
await
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
finish
up
,
''
said
that
Liberal
voter
,
``
with
a
place
in
the
*NL*
Government
,
which
will
compel
you
to
take
some
step
which
will
be
*NL*
calumniated
.
It
will
only
be
by
your
own
disgrace
that
I
shall
have
*NL*
news
of
you
.
Remember
that
,
even
from
the
financial
standpoint
,
it
is
*NL*
better
to
earn
a
hundred
louis
in
a
good
timber
business
,
of
which
*NL*
one
is
his
own
master
,
than
to
receive
four
thousand
francs
from
a
*NL*
Government
,
even
though
it
were
that
of
King
Solomon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
saw
nothing
in
this
except
the
pettiness
of
spirit
of
a
country
*NL*
bourgeois
.
At
last
he
was
going
to
make
an
appearance
in
the
theatre
of
*NL*
great
events
.
Everything
was
over-shadowed
in
his
eyes
by
the
happiness
*NL*
of
going
to
Paris
,
which
he
imagined
to
be
populated
by
people
of
*NL*
intellect
,
full
of
intrigues
and
full
of
hypocrisy
,
but
as
polite
as
*NL*
the
Bishop
of
Besancon
and
the
Bishop
of
Agde
.
He
represented
to
his
*NL*
friend
that
he
was
deprived
of
any
free
choice
in
the
matter
by
the
*NL*
abbe
Pirard
's
letter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
day
he
arrived
at
Verrieres
about
noon
.
He
felt
the
*NL*
happiest
of
men
for
he
counted
on
seeing
Madame
de
Renal
again
.
He
*NL*
went
first
to
his
protector
the
good
abbe
Chelan
.
He
met
with
a
severe
*NL*
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
you
are
under
any
obligation
to
me
?
''
said
M.
Chelan
to
*NL*
him
,
without
answering
his
greeting
.
``
You
will
take
breakfast
with
me
.
*NL*
During
that
time
I
will
have
a
horse
hired
for
you
and
you
will
leave
*NL*
Verrieres
without
seeing
anyone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hearing
is
obeying
,
''
answered
Julien
with
a
demeanour
smacking
of
*NL*
the
seminary
,
and
the
only
questions
now
discussed
were
theology
and
*NL*
classical
Latin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
mounted
his
horse
,
rode
a
league
,
and
then
perceiving
a
wood
and
*NL*
not
seeing
any
one
who
could
notice
him
enter
,
he
plunged
into
it
.
*NL*
At
sunset
,
he
sent
away
the
horse
.
Later
,
he
entered
the
cottage
of
*NL*
a
peasant
,
who
consented
to
sell
him
a
ladder
and
to
follow
him
with
*NL*
it
to
the
little
wood
which
commands
the
_
Cours
de
la
Fidelite
_
at
*NL*
Verrieres
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
following
a
poor
mutineer
of
a
conscript
...
or
a
*NL*
smuggler
,
''
said
the
peasant
as
he
took
leave
of
him
,
``
but
what
does
*NL*
it
matter
?
My
ladder
has
been
well
paid
for
,
and
I
myself
have
done
a
*NL*
thing
or
two
in
that
line
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
very
black
.
Towards
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
Julien
,
*NL*
laden
with
his
ladder
,
entered
Verrieres
.
He
descended
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
could
into
the
bed
of
the
stream
,
which
is
banked
within
two
walls
,
and
*NL*
traverses
M.
de
Renal
's
magnificent
gardens
at
a
depth
of
ten
feet
.
*NL*
Julien
easily
climbed
up
the
ladder
.
``
How
will
the
watch
dogs
welcome
*NL*
me
,
''
he
thought
.
``
It
all
turns
on
that
.
''
The
dogs
barked
and
galloped
*NL*
towards
him
,
but
he
whistled
softly
and
they
came
and
caressed
him
.
*NL*
Then
climbing
from
terrace
to
terrace
he
easily
managed
,
although
all
*NL*
the
grills
were
shut
,
to
get
as
far
as
the
window
of
Madame
de
Renal
's
*NL*
bedroom
which
,
on
the
garden
side
,
was
only
eight
or
six
feet
above
the
*NL*
ground
.
There
was
a
little
heart
shaped
opening
in
the
shutters
which
*NL*
Julien
knew
well
.
To
his
great
disappointment
,
this
little
opening
was
*NL*
not
illuminated
by
the
flare
of
a
little
night-light
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
This
room
is
not
occupied
by
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
.
Where
can
she
be
sleeping
?
The
family
must
be
at
Verrieres
since
*NL*
I
have
found
the
dogs
here
,
but
I
might
meet
M.
de
Renal
himself
,
or
*NL*
even
a
stranger
in
this
room
without
a
light
,
and
then
what
a
scandal
!
''
*NL*
The
most
prudent
course
was
to
retreat
,
but
this
idea
horrified
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
's
a
stranger
,
I
will
run
away
for
all
I
'm
worth
,
and
leave
my
*NL*
ladder
behind
me
,
but
if
it
is
she
,
what
a
welcome
awaits
me
!
I
can
*NL*
well
imagine
that
she
has
fallen
into
a
mood
of
penitence
and
the
most
*NL*
exalted
piety
,
but
after
all
,
she
still
has
some
remembrance
of
me
,
*NL*
since
she
has
written
to
me
.
''
This
bit
of
reasoning
decided
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
beating
heart
,
but
resolved
none
the
less
to
see
her
or
perish
*NL*
in
the
attempt
,
he
threw
some
little
pebbles
against
the
shutter
.
*NL*
No
answer
.
He
leaned
his
long
ladder
beside
the
window
,
and
himself
*NL*
knocked
on
the
shutter
,
at
first
softly
,
and
then
more
strongly
.
*NL*
``
However
dark
it
is
,
they
may
still
shoot
me
,
''
thought
Julien
.
This
*NL*
idea
made
the
mad
adventure
simply
a
question
of
bravery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
room
is
not
being
slept
in
to-night
,
''
he
thought
,
``
or
whatever
*NL*
person
might
be
there
would
have
woken
up
by
now
.
So
far
as
it
is
*NL*
concerned
,
therefore
,
no
further
precautions
are
needed
.
I
must
only
*NL*
try
not
to
be
heard
by
the
persons
sleeping
in
the
other
rooms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
descended
,
placed
his
ladder
against
one
of
the
shutters
,
climbed
*NL*
up
again
,
and
placing
his
hand
through
the
heart-shaped
opening
,
was
*NL*
fortunate
enough
to
find
pretty
quickly
the
wire
which
is
attached
to
*NL*
the
hook
which
closed
the
shutter
.
He
pulled
this
wire
.
It
was
with
an
*NL*
ineffable
joy
that
he
felt
that
the
shutter
was
no
longer
held
back
,
*NL*
and
yielded
to
his
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
open
it
bit
by
bit
and
let
her
recognise
my
voice
.
He
opened
the
*NL*
shutter
enough
to
pass
his
head
through
it
,
while
he
repeated
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
,
``
It
's
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pricked
up
his
ears
and
assured
himself
that
nothing
disturbed
the
*NL*
profound
silence
of
the
room
,
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
,
*NL*
there
was
no
light
,
even
half-extinguished
,
on
the
mantelpiece
.
It
was
*NL*
a
very
bad
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out
for
the
gun-shot
,
''
he
reflected
a
little
,
then
he
ventured
*NL*
to
knock
against
the
window
with
his
finger
.
No
answer
.
He
knocked
*NL*
harder
.
I
must
finish
it
one
way
or
another
,
even
if
I
have
to
break
*NL*
the
window
.
When
he
was
knocking
very
hard
,
he
thought
he
could
catch
*NL*
a
glimpse
through
the
darkness
of
something
like
a
white
shadow
that
*NL*
was
crossing
the
room
.
At
last
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
.
He
saw
a
*NL*
shadow
which
appeared
to
advance
with
extreme
slowness
.
Suddenly
he
saw
*NL*
a
cheek
placed
against
the
pane
to
which
his
eye
was
glued
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shuddered
and
went
away
a
little
,
but
the
night
was
so
black
that
*NL*
he
could
not
,
even
at
this
distance
,
distinguish
if
it
were
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
.
He
was
frightened
of
her
crying
out
at
first
in
alarm
.
He
heard
*NL*
the
dogs
prowling
and
growling
around
the
foot
of
the
ladder
.
``
It
is
*NL*
I
,
''
he
repeated
fairly
loudly
.
``
A
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
answer
.
The
white
phantom
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deign
to
open
to
me
.
I
must
speak
to
you
.
I
am
too
unhappy
.
''
And
he
*NL*
knocked
hard
enough
to
break
the
pane
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
crisp
sound
followed
.
The
casement
fastening
of
the
window
yielded
.
*NL*
He
pushed
the
casement
and
leaped
lightly
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
white
phantom
flitted
away
from
him
.
He
took
hold
of
its
arms
.
It
*NL*
was
a
woman
.
All
his
ideas
of
courage
vanished
.
``
If
it
is
she
,
what
is
*NL*
she
going
to
say
?
''
What
were
his
emotions
when
a
little
cry
gave
him
to
*NL*
understand
,
that
it
was
Madame
de
Renal
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
clasped
her
in
his
arms
.
She
trembled
and
scarcely
had
the
strength
*NL*
to
push
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unhappy
man
.
What
are
you
doing
?
''
Her
agonised
voice
could
scarcely
*NL*
articulate
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
thought
that
her
voice
rang
with
the
most
genuine
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
to
see
you
after
a
cruel
separation
of
more
than
fourteen
*NL*
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
leave
me
at
once
.
Oh
,
M.
Chelan
,
why
did
you
prevent
me
*NL*
writing
to
him
?
I
could
then
have
foreseen
this
horror
.
''
She
pushed
*NL*
him
away
with
a
truly
extraordinary
strength
.
``
Heaven
has
deigned
to
*NL*
enlighten
me
,
''
she
repeated
in
a
broken
voice
.
``
Go
away
!
Flee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
fourteen
months
of
unhappiness
I
shall
certainly
not
leave
you
*NL*
without
a
word
.
I
want
to
know
all
you
have
done
.
Yes
,
I
have
loved
*NL*
you
enough
to
deserve
this
confidence
.
I
want
to
know
everything
.
''
*NL*
This
authoritative
tone
dominated
Madame
de
Renal
's
heart
in
spite
of
*NL*
herself
.
Julien
,
who
was
hugging
her
passionately
and
resisting
her
*NL*
efforts
to
get
loose
,
left
off
clasping
her
in
his
arms
.
This
reassured
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
away
the
ladder
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
prevent
it
compromising
*NL*
us
in
case
some
servant
should
be
awakened
by
the
noise
,
and
go
on
a
*NL*
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
leave
me
,
leave
me
!
''
she
cried
with
an
admirable
anger
.
``
What
*NL*
do
men
matter
to
me
!
It
is
God
who
sees
the
awful
scene
you
are
now
*NL*
making
.
You
are
abusing
meanly
the
sentiments
which
I
had
for
you
but
*NL*
have
no
longer
.
Do
you
hear
,
Monsieur
Julien
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
away
the
ladder
very
slowly
so
as
not
to
make
a
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
husband
in
town
,
dear
,
''
he
said
to
her
not
in
order
to
defy
*NL*
her
but
as
a
sheer
matter
of
habit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
to
me
like
that
,
I
beg
you
,
or
I
will
call
my
husband
.
I
*NL*
feel
only
too
guilty
in
not
having
sent
you
away
before
.
I
pity
you
,
''
*NL*
she
said
to
him
,
trying
to
wound
his
,
as
she
well
knew
,
irritable
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
refusal
of
all
endearments
,
this
abrupt
way
of
breaking
so
tender
*NL*
a
tie
which
he
thought
still
subsisted
,
carried
the
transports
of
*NL*
Julien
's
love
to
the
point
of
delirium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
is
it
possible
you
do
not
love
me
?
''
he
said
to
her
,
with
one
of
*NL*
those
accents
that
come
straight
from
the
heart
and
impose
a
severe
*NL*
strain
on
the
cold
equanimity
of
the
listener
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
As
for
him
,
he
wept
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
he
had
no
longer
the
strength
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
am
completely
forgotten
by
the
one
being
who
ever
loved
me
,
what
*NL*
is
the
good
of
living
on
henceforth
?
''
As
soon
as
he
had
no
longer
to
*NL*
fear
the
danger
of
meeting
a
man
all
his
courage
had
left
him
;
his
*NL*
heart
now
contained
no
emotion
except
that
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wept
for
a
long
time
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
hand
;
she
tried
to
take
it
away
,
and
after
a
few
almost
*NL*
convulsive
moments
,
surrendered
it
to
him
.
It
was
extremely
dark
;
they
*NL*
were
both
sitting
on
Madame
de
Renal
's
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
change
from
fourteen
months
ago
,
''
thought
Julien
,
and
his
tears
*NL*
redoubled
.
``
So
absence
is
really
bound
to
destroy
all
human
sentiments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deign
to
tell
me
what
has
happened
to
you
?
''
Julien
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
follies
,
''
answered
Madame
de
Renal
in
a
hard
voice
whose
frigid
*NL*
intonation
contained
in
it
a
certain
element
of
reproach
,
``
were
no
*NL*
doubt
known
in
the
town
when
you
left
,
your
conduct
was
so
imprudent
.
*NL*
Some
time
afterwards
when
I
was
in
despair
the
venerable
Chelan
came
to
*NL*
see
me
.
He
tried
in
vain
for
a
long
time
to
obtain
a
confession
.
One
*NL*
day
he
took
me
to
that
church
at
Dijon
where
I
made
my
first
communion
.
*NL*
In
that
place
he
ventured
to
speak
himself
--
''
Madame
de
Renal
*NL*
was
interrupted
by
her
tears
.
``
What
a
moment
of
shame
.
I
confessed
*NL*
everything
.
The
good
man
was
gracious
enough
not
to
overwhelm
me
with
*NL*
the
weight
of
his
indignation
.
He
grieved
with
me
.
During
that
time
I
*NL*
used
to
write
letters
to
you
every
day
which
I
never
ventured
to
send
.
*NL*
I
hid
them
carefully
and
when
I
was
more
than
usually
unhappy
I
shut
*NL*
myself
up
in
my
room
and
read
over
my
letters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
M.
Chelan
induced
me
to
hand
them
over
to
him
,
some
of
them
*NL*
written
a
little
more
discreetly
were
sent
to
you
,
you
never
answered

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
received
any
letters

I
swear
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
heavens

Who
can
have
intercepted

Imagine
my
grief
until
*NL*
the
day
I
saw
you
in
the
cathedral
.
I
did
not
know
if
you
were
still
*NL*
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
granted
me
the
grace

understanding
how
much
I
was
sinning

towards
Him

towards
my
husband

went
on
Madame
*NL*
de
Renal
.
``
He
never
loved
me
in
the
way
that
I
then
thought
that
you
*NL*
had
loved
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
rushed
into
her
arms
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
without
any
particular
*NL*
purpose
and
feeling
quite
beside
himself
.
But
Madame
de
Renal
repelled
*NL*
him
and
continued
fairly
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
venerable
friend
,
M.
Chelan
,
made
me
understand
that
in
marrying
I
*NL*
had
plighted
all
my
affections
,
even
those
which
I
did
not
then
know
,
*NL*
and
which
I
had
never
felt
before
a
certain
fatal
attachment
...
after
*NL*
the
great
sacrifice
of
the
letters
that
were
so
dear
to
me
,
my
life
has
*NL*
flowed
on
,
if
not
happily
,
at
any
rate
calmly
.
Do
not
disturb
it
.
Be
*NL*
a
friend
to
me
,
my
best
friend
.
''
Julien
covered
her
hand
with
kisses
.
*NL*
She
perceived
he
was
still
crying
.
``
Do
not
cry
,
you
pain
me
so
much
.
*NL*
Tell
me
,
in
your
turn
,
what
you
have
been
doing
,
''
Julien
was
unable
*NL*
to
speak
.
``
I
want
to
know
the
life
you
lead
at
the
seminary
,
''
she
*NL*
repeated
.
``
And
then
you
will
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
thinking
about
what
he
was
saying
Julien
spoke
of
the
*NL*
numberless
intrigues
and
jealousies
which
he
had
first
encountered
,
and
*NL*
then
of
the
great
serenity
of
his
life
after
he
had
been
made
a
tutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
then
,
''
he
added
,
``
that
after
a
long
silence
which
was
no
doubt
*NL*
intended
to
make
me
realise
what
I
see
only
too
clearly
to-day
,
that
*NL*
you
no
longer
loved
me
and
that
I
had
become
a
matter
of
indifference
*NL*
to
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
wrung
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
then
that
you
sent
me
the
sum
of
five
hundred
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
letter
stamped
Paris
and
signed
Paul
Sorel
so
as
to
avert
*NL*
suspicion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
discussion
about
how
the
letter
could
possibly
have
*NL*
originated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
psychological
situation
was
altered
.
Without
knowing
it
Julien
had
*NL*
abandoned
his
solemn
tone
;
they
were
now
once
more
on
the
footing
of
a
*NL*
tender
affection
.
It
was
so
dark
that
they
did
not
see
each
other
but
*NL*
the
tone
of
their
voices
was
eloquent
of
everything
.
Julien
clasped
*NL*
his
arm
round
his
love
's
waist
.
This
movement
had
its
dangers
.
She
*NL*
tried
to
put
Julien
's
arms
away
from
her
;
at
this
juncture
he
cleverly
*NL*
diverted
her
attention
by
an
interesting
detail
in
his
story
.
The
arm
*NL*
was
practically
forgotten
and
remained
in
its
present
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
many
conjectures
as
to
the
origin
of
the
five
hundred
francs
*NL*
letter
,
Julien
took
up
his
story
.
He
regained
a
little
of
his
*NL*
self-control
as
he
spoke
of
his
past
life
,
which
compared
with
what
he
*NL*
was
now
experiencing
interested
him
so
little
.
His
attention
was
now
*NL*
concentrated
on
the
final
outcome
of
of
his
visit
.
``
You
will
have
to
*NL*
go
,
''
were
the
curt
words
he
heard
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
disgrace
for
me
if
I
am
dismissed
.
My
remorse
will
embitter
all
*NL*
my
life
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
she
will
never
write
to
me
.
God
knows
*NL*
when
I
shall
come
back
to
this
part
of
the
country
.
''
From
this
moment
*NL*
Julien
's
heart
became
rapidly
oblivious
of
all
the
heavenly
delights
of
*NL*
his
present
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seated
as
he
was
close
to
a
woman
whom
he
adored
and
practically
*NL*
clasping
her
in
his
arms
in
this
room
,
the
scene
of
his
former
*NL*
happiness
,
amid
a
deep
obscurity
,
seeing
quite
clearly
as
he
did
that
*NL*
she
had
just
started
crying
,
and
feeling
that
she
was
sobbing
from
the
*NL*
heaving
of
her
chest
,
he
was
unfortunate
enough
to
turn
into
a
cold
*NL*
diplomatist
,
nearly
as
cold
as
in
those
days
when
in
the
courtyard
*NL*
of
the
seminary
he
found
himself
the
butt
of
some
malicious
joke
on
*NL*
the
part
of
one
of
his
comrades
who
was
stronger
than
he
was
.
Julien
*NL*
protracted
his
story
by
talking
of
his
unhappy
life
since
his
departure
*NL*
from
Verrieres
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
to
herself
,
``
after
a
year
's
absence
and
*NL*
deprived
almost
entirely
of
all
tokens
of
memory
while
I
myself
was
*NL*
forgetting
him
,
he
only
thought
of
the
happy
days
that
he
had
had
in
*NL*
Verrieres
.
''
Her
sobs
redoubled
.
Julien
saw
the
success
of
his
story
.
*NL*
He
realised
that
he
must
play
his
last
card
.
He
abruptly
mentioned
a
*NL*
letter
he
had
just
received
from
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
taken
leave
of
my
Lord
Bishop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
are
not
going
back
to
Besancon
?
You
are
leaving
us
for
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Julien
resolutely
,
``
yes
,
I
am
leaving
a
country
where
I
*NL*
have
been
forgotten
even
by
the
woman
whom
I
loved
more
than
anyone
in
*NL*
my
life
;
I
am
leaving
it
and
I
shall
never
see
it
again
.
I
am
going
to
*NL*
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
to
Paris
,
dear
,
''
exclaimed
Madame
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
was
almost
choked
by
her
tears
and
showed
the
extremity
of
*NL*
her
trouble
.
Julien
had
need
of
this
encouragement
.
He
was
on
the
point
*NL*
of
executing
a
manoeuvre
which
might
decide
everything
against
him
;
and
*NL*
up
to
the
time
of
this
exclamation
he
could
not
tell
what
effect
he
was
*NL*
producing
as
he
was
unable
to
see
.
He
no
longer
hesitated
.
The
fear
of
*NL*
remorse
gave
him
complete
control
over
himself
.
He
coldly
added
as
he
*NL*
got
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madame
,
I
leave
you
for
ever
.
May
you
be
happy
.
Adieu
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
some
steps
towards
the
window
.
He
began
to
open
it
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
rushed
to
him
and
threw
herself
into
his
arms
.
So
it
was
in
this
*NL*
way
that
,
after
a
dialogue
lasting
three
hours
,
Julien
obtained
what
he
*NL*
desired
so
passionately
during
the
first
two
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
's
return
to
her
tender
feelings
and
this
overshadowing
*NL*
of
her
remorse
would
have
been
a
divine
happiness
had
they
come
a
*NL*
little
earlier
;
but
,
as
they
had
been
obtained
by
artifice
,
they
were
*NL*
simply
a
pleasure
.
Julien
insisted
on
lighting
the
night-light
in
spite
*NL*
of
his
mistress
's
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
me
then
,
''
he
said
to
her
``
to
have
no
recollection
of
*NL*
having
seen
you
.
Is
the
love
in
those
charming
eyes
to
be
lost
to
me
*NL*
for
ever
?
Is
the
whiteness
of
that
pretty
hand
to
remain
invisible
?
*NL*
Remember
that
perhaps
I
am
leaving
you
for
a
very
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
could
refuse
him
nothing
.
His
argument
made
her
melt
*NL*
into
tears
.
But
the
dawn
was
beginning
to
throw
into
sharp
relief
the
*NL*
outlines
of
the
pine
trees
on
the
mountain
east
of
Verrieres
.
Instead
*NL*
of
going
away
Julien
,
drunk
with
pleasure
,
asked
Madame
de
Renal
to
let
*NL*
him
pass
the
day
in
her
room
and
leave
the
following
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
?
''
she
answered
.
``
This
fatal
relapse
robs
me
of
all
my
*NL*
respect
and
will
mar
all
my
life
,
''
and
she
pressed
him
to
her
heart
.
*NL*
``
My
husband
is
no
longer
the
same
;
he
has
suspicions
,
he
believes
I
led
*NL*
him
the
way
I
wanted
in
all
this
business
,
and
shows
great
irritation
*NL*
against
me
.
If
he
hears
the
slightest
noise
I
shall
be
ruined
,
he
will
*NL*
hound
me
out
like
the
unhappy
woman
that
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
here
we
have
a
phrase
of
M.
Chelan
's
,
''
said
Julien
``
you
would
not
*NL*
have
talked
like
that
before
my
cruel
departure
to
the
seminary
;
in
*NL*
those
days
you
used
to
love
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
rewarded
for
the
frigidity
which
he
put
into
those
words
.
He
*NL*
saw
his
love
suddenly
forget
the
danger
which
her
husband
's
presence
*NL*
compelled
her
to
run
,
in
thinking
of
the
much
greater
danger
of
seeing
*NL*
Julien
doubt
her
love
.
The
daylight
grew
rapidly
brighter
and
vividly
*NL*
illuminated
the
room
.
Julien
savoured
once
more
all
the
deliciousness
*NL*
of
pride
,
when
he
saw
this
charming
woman
in
his
arms
and
almost
at
his
*NL*
feet
,
the
only
woman
whom
he
had
ever
loved
,
and
who
had
been
entirely
*NL*
absorbed
only
a
few
hours
before
by
her
fear
of
a
terrible
God
and
her
*NL*
devotion
to
her
duties
.
Resolutions
,
fortified
by
a
year
's
persuasion
,
*NL*
had
failed
to
hold
out
against
his
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
soon
heard
a
noise
in
the
house
.
A
matter
that
Madame
de
Renal
had
*NL*
not
thought
of
began
to
trouble
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
wicked
Elisa
will
come
into
the
room
.
What
are
we
to
do
with
this
*NL*
enormous
ladder
?
''
she
said
to
her
sweetheart
,
``
where
are
we
to
hide
it
?
*NL*
I
will
take
it
to
the
loft
,
''
she
exclaimed
suddenly
half
playfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
have
to
pass
through
the
servants
'
room
,
''
said
Julien
in
*NL*
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
leave
the
ladder
in
the
corridor
and
will
call
the
servant
and
*NL*
send
him
on
an
errand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
of
some
explanation
to
have
ready
in
the
event
of
a
servant
*NL*
passing
the
ladder
and
noticing
it
in
the
corridor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
angel
,
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
giving
him
a
kiss
``
as
for
you
,
*NL*
dear
,
remember
to
hide
under
the
bed
pretty
quickly
if
Elisa
enters
*NL*
here
during
my
absence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
astonished
by
this
sudden
gaiety
--
``
So
''
he
thought
,
``
the
*NL*
approach
of
a
real
danger
instead
of
troubling
her
gives
her
back
*NL*
her
spirits
before
she
forgets
her
remorse
.
Truly
a
superior
woman
.
*NL*
Yes
,
that
's
a
heart
over
which
it
is
glorious
to
reign
.
''
Julien
was
*NL*
transported
with
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
took
the
ladder
,
which
was
obviously
too
heavy
for
her
.
*NL*
Julien
went
to
her
help
.
He
was
admiring
that
elegant
figure
which
was
*NL*
so
far
from
betokening
any
strength
when
she
suddenly
seized
the
ladder
*NL*
without
assistance
and
took
it
up
as
if
it
had
been
a
chair
.
She
took
*NL*
it
rapidly
into
the
corridor
of
the
third
storey
where
she
laid
it
*NL*
alongside
the
wall
.
She
called
a
servant
,
and
in
order
to
give
him
time
*NL*
to
dress
himself
,
went
up
into
the
dovecot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
later
,
when
she
came
back
to
the
corridor
,
she
found
no
*NL*
signs
of
the
ladder
.
What
had
happened
to
it
?
If
Julien
had
been
out
*NL*
of
the
house
she
would
not
have
minded
the
danger
in
the
least
.
But
*NL*
supposing
her
husband
were
to
see
the
ladder
just
now
,
the
incident
*NL*
might
be
awful
.
Madame
de
Renal
ran
all
over
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
finally
discovered
the
ladder
under
the
roof
where
the
*NL*
servant
had
carried
it
and
even
hid
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
matter
what
happens
in
twenty-four
hours
,
''
she
thought
,
*NL*
``
when
Julien
will
be
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
vague
idea
that
she
ought
to
take
leave
of
life
but
what
*NL*
mattered
her
duty
?
He
was
restored
to
her
after
a
separation
which
she
*NL*
had
thought
eternal
.
She
was
seeing
him
again
and
the
efforts
he
had
*NL*
made
to
reach
her
showed
the
extent
of
his
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
say
to
my
husband
,
''
she
said
to
him
.
``
If
the
servant
*NL*
tells
him
he
found
this
ladder
?
''
She
was
pensive
for
a
moment
.
``
They
*NL*
will
need
twenty-four
hours
to
discover
the
peasant
who
sold
it
*NL*
to
you
.
''
And
she
threw
herself
into
Julien
's
arms
and
clasped
him
*NL*
convulsively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
I
could
only
die
like
this
,
''
she
cried
covering
him
with
*NL*
kisses
.
``
But
you
must
n't
die
of
starvation
,
''
she
said
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
I
will
first
hide
you
in
Madame
Derville
's
room
which
is
always
*NL*
locked
.
''
She
went
and
watched
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
and
*NL*
Julien
ran
in
.
``
Mind
you
do
n't
try
and
open
if
any
one
knocks
,
''
she
*NL*
said
as
she
locked
him
in
.
``
Anyway
it
would
only
be
a
frolic
of
the
*NL*
children
as
they
play
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
them
to
come
into
the
garden
under
the
window
,
''
said
Julien
,
``
so
*NL*
that
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
.
Make
them
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
cried
Madame
de
Renal
to
him
as
she
went
away
.
She
soon
*NL*
returned
with
oranges
,
biscuits
and
a
bottle
of
Malaga
wine
.
She
had
*NL*
not
been
able
to
steal
any
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
husband
doing
?
''
said
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
writing
out
the
figures
of
the
bargains
he
is
going
to
make
with
*NL*
the
peasants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
eight
o'clock
had
struck
and
they
were
making
a
lot
of
noise
in
the
*NL*
house
.
If
Madame
de
Renal
failed
to
put
in
an
appearance
,
they
would
*NL*
look
for
her
all
over
the
house
.
She
was
obliged
to
leave
him
.
Soon
she
*NL*
came
back
,
in
defiance
of
all
prudence
,
bringing
him
a
cup
of
coffee
.
*NL*
She
was
frightened
lest
he
should
die
of
starvation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
managed
after
breakfast
to
bring
the
children
under
the
window
of
*NL*
Madame
Derville
's
room
.
He
thought
they
had
grown
a
great
deal
,
but
*NL*
they
had
begun
to
look
common
,
or
else
his
ideas
had
changed
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Renal
spoke
to
them
about
Julien
.
The
elder
answered
in
an
affectionate
*NL*
tone
and
regretted
his
old
tutor
,
but
he
found
that
the
younger
*NL*
children
had
almost
forgotten
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
did
not
go
out
that
morning
;
he
was
going
up
and
downstairs
*NL*
incessantly
engaged
in
bargaining
with
some
peasants
to
whom
he
was
*NL*
selling
potatoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
did
not
have
an
instant
to
give
to
her
prisoner
until
*NL*
dinner-time
.
When
the
bell
had
been
rung
and
dinner
had
been
served
,
*NL*
it
occurred
to
her
to
steal
a
plate
of
warm
soup
for
him
.
As
she
*NL*
noiselessly
approached
the
door
of
the
room
which
he
occupied
,
she
*NL*
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
servant
who
had
hid
the
ladder
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
At
the
time
he
too
was
going
noiselessly
along
the
*NL*
corridor
,
as
though
listening
for
something
.
The
servant
took
himself
*NL*
off
in
some
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
boldly
entered
Julien
's
room
.
The
news
of
this
*NL*
encounter
made
him
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
frightened
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
``
but
I
would
brave
all
the
*NL*
dangers
in
the
world
without
flinching
.
There
is
only
one
thing
I
fear
,
*NL*
and
that
is
the
moment
when
I
shall
be
alone
after
you
have
left
,
''
and
*NL*
she
left
him
and
ran
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
thought
Julien
ecstatically
,
``
remorse
is
the
only
danger
which
*NL*
this
sublime
soul
is
afraid
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
evening
came
.
Monsieur
de
Renal
went
to
the
Casino
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
had
given
out
that
she
was
suffering
from
an
awful
headache
.
*NL*
She
went
to
her
room
,
hastened
to
dismiss
Elisa
and
quickly
got
up
in
*NL*
order
to
let
Julien
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
literally
starving
.
Madame
de
Renal
went
to
the
pantry
to
fetch
*NL*
some
bread
.
Julien
heard
a
loud
cry
.
Madame
de
Renal
came
back
and
told
*NL*
him
that
when
she
went
to
the
dark
pantry
and
got
near
the
cupboard
*NL*
where
they
kept
the
bread
,
she
had
touched
a
woman
's
arm
as
she
*NL*
stretched
out
her
hand
.
It
was
Elisa
who
had
uttered
the
cry
Julien
had
*NL*
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
she
doing
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stealing
some
sweets
or
else
spying
on
us
,
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
with
*NL*
complete
indifference
,
``
but
luckily
I
found
a
pie
and
a
big
loaf
of
*NL*
bread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
have
you
got
there
?
''
said
Julien
pointing
to
the
pockets
of
*NL*
her
apron
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
had
forgotten
that
they
had
been
filled
with
bread
*NL*
since
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
clasped
her
in
his
arms
with
the
most
lively
passion
.
She
had
*NL*
never
seemed
to
him
so
beautiful
.
``
I
could
not
meet
a
woman
of
greater
*NL*
character
even
at
Paris
,
''
he
said
confusedly
to
himself
.
She
combined
*NL*
all
the
clumsiness
of
a
woman
who
was
but
little
accustomed
to
paying
*NL*
attentions
of
this
kind
,
with
all
the
genuine
courage
of
a
person
who
*NL*
is
only
afraid
of
dangers
of
quite
a
different
sphere
and
quite
a
*NL*
different
kind
of
awfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Julien
was
enjoying
his
supper
with
a
hearty
appetite
and
his
*NL*
sweetheart
was
rallying
him
on
the
simplicity
of
the
meal
,
the
door
of
*NL*
the
room
was
suddenly
shaken
violently
.
It
was
M.
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
shut
yourself
in
?
''
he
cried
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
only
just
time
to
slip
under
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
any
ordinary
day
Madame
de
Renal
would
have
been
upset
by
this
*NL*
question
which
was
put
with
true
conjugal
harshness
;
but
she
realised
*NL*
that
M.
de
Renal
had
only
to
bend
down
a
little
to
notice
Julien
,
for
*NL*
M.
de
Renal
had
flung
himself
into
the
chair
opposite
the
sofa
which
*NL*
Julien
had
been
sitting
in
one
moment
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
headache
served
as
an
excuse
for
everything
.
While
her
husband
on
*NL*
his
side
went
into
a
long-winded
account
of
the
billiards
pool
which
he
*NL*
had
won
at
Casino
,
``
yes
,
to
be
sure
a
nineteen
franc
pool
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
She
noticed
Julien
's
hat
on
a
chair
three
paces
in
front
of
them
.
*NL*
Her
self-possession
became
twice
as
great
,
she
began
to
undress
,
and
*NL*
rapidly
passing
one
minute
behind
her
husband
threw
her
dress
over
the
*NL*
chair
with
the
hat
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
M.
de
Renal
left
.
She
begged
Julien
to
start
over
again
his
*NL*
account
of
his
life
at
the
Seminary
.
``
I
was
not
listening
to
you
*NL*
yesterday
all
the
time
you
were
speaking
,
I
was
only
thinking
of
*NL*
prevailing
on
myself
to
send
you
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
the
personification
of
indiscretion
.
They
talked
very
loud
and
*NL*
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
they
were
interrupted
by
a
violent
*NL*
knock
at
the
door
.
It
was
M.
de
Renal
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Open
quickly
,
there
are
thieves
in
the
house
!
''
he
said
.
``
Saint
Jean
*NL*
found
their
ladder
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
end
of
everything
,
''
cried
Madame
de
Renal
,
throwing
*NL*
herself
into
Julien
's
arms
.
``
He
will
kill
both
of
us
,
he
does
n't
*NL*
believe
there
are
any
thieves
.
I
will
die
in
your
arms
,
and
be
more
*NL*
happy
in
my
death
than
I
ever
was
in
my
life
.
''
She
made
no
attempt
to
*NL*
answer
her
husband
who
was
beginning
to
lose
his
temper
,
but
started
*NL*
kissing
Julien
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Save
Stanislas
's
mother
,
''
he
said
to
her
with
an
imperious
look
.
``
I
*NL*
will
jump
down
into
the
courtyard
through
the
lavatory
window
,
and
*NL*
escape
in
the
garden
;
the
dogs
have
recognised
me
.
Make
my
clothes
into
*NL*
a
parcel
and
throw
them
into
the
garden
as
soon
as
you
can
.
In
the
*NL*
meanwhile
let
him
break
the
door
down
.
But
above
all
,
no
confession
,
I
*NL*
forbid
you
to
confess
,
it
is
better
that
he
should
suspect
rather
than
*NL*
be
certain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
kill
yourself
as
you
jump
!
''
was
her
only
answer
and
her
only
*NL*
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
with
him
to
the
lavatory
window
;
she
then
took
sufficient
time
*NL*
to
hide
his
clothes
.
She
finally
opened
the
door
to
her
husband
who
was
*NL*
boiling
with
rage
.
He
looked
in
the
room
and
in
the
lavatory
without
*NL*
saying
a
word
and
disappeared
.
Julien
's
clothes
were
thrown
down
to
*NL*
him
;
he
seized
them
and
ran
rapidly
towards
the
bottom
of
the
garden
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
Doubs
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
running
he
heard
a
bullet
whistle
past
him
,
and
heard
at
the
*NL*
same
time
the
report
of
a
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
M.
de
Renal
,
''
he
thought
,
``
he
's
far
too
bad
a
shot
.
''
The
*NL*
dogs
ran
silently
at
his
side
,
the
second
shot
apparently
broke
the
paw
*NL*
of
one
dog
,
for
he
began
to
whine
piteously
.
Julien
jumped
the
wall
of
*NL*
the
terrace
,
did
fifty
paces
under
cover
,
and
began
to
fly
in
another
*NL*
direction
.
He
heard
voices
calling
and
had
a
distinct
view
of
his
enemy
*NL*
the
servant
firing
a
gun
;
a
farmer
also
began
to
shoot
away
from
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
garden
.
Julien
had
already
reached
the
bank
of
the
*NL*
Doubs
where
he
dressed
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
later
he
was
a
league
from
Verrieres
on
the
Geneva
road
.
``
If
*NL*
they
had
suspicions
,
''
thought
Julien
,
``
they
will
look
for
me
on
the
*NL*
Paris
road
.

THE

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
no
doubt
come
to
wait
for
the
Paris
mail
,
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
*NL*
host
of
an
inn
where
he
had
stopped
to
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
or
to-morrow
,
it
matters
little
,
''
said
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mail
arrived
while
he
was
still
posing
as
indifferent
.
There
were
*NL*
two
free
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
it
's
you
my
poor
Falcoz
,
''
said
the
traveller
who
was
coming
from
*NL*
the
Geneva
side
to
the
one
who
was
getting
in
at
the
same
time
as
*NL*
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
settled
in
the
outskirts
of
Lyons
,
''
said
Falcoz
,
*NL*
``
in
a
delicious
valley
near
the
Rhone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicely
settled
!
I
am
running
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
are
running
away
?
you
Saint
Giraud
!
Have
you
,
who
look
so
*NL*
virtuous
,
committed
some
crime
?
''
said
Falcoz
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
faith
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
.
I
am
running
away
from
the
*NL*
abominable
life
which
one
leads
in
the
provinces
.
I
like
the
freshness
*NL*
of
the
woods
and
the
country
tranquillity
,
as
you
know
.
You
have
often
*NL*
accused
me
of
being
romantic
.
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
politics
talked
as
*NL*
long
as
I
live
,
and
politics
are
hounding
me
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
party
do
you
belong
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
none
and
that
's
what
ruins
me
.
That
's
all
there
is
to
be
said
*NL*
about
my
political
life
--
I
like
music
and
painting
.
A
good
book
is
*NL*
an
event
for
me
.
I
am
going
to
be
forty-four
.
How
much
longer
have
I
*NL*
got
to
live
?
Fifteen
--
twenty
--
thirty
years
at
the
outside
.
Well
,
I
*NL*
want
the
ministers
in
thirty
years
'
time
to
be
a
little
cleverer
than
*NL*
those
of
to-day
but
quite
as
honest
.
The
history
of
England
serves
as
*NL*
a
mirror
for
our
own
future
.
There
will
always
be
a
king
who
will
try
*NL*
to
increase
his
prerogative
.
The
ambition
of
becoming
a
deputy
,
the
*NL*
fame
of
Mirabeau
and
the
hundreds
of
thousand
francs
which
he
won
for
*NL*
himself
will
always
prevent
the
rich
people
in
the
province
from
going
*NL*
to
sleep
:
they
will
call
that
being
Liberal
and
loving
the
people
.
The
*NL*
desire
of
becoming
a
peer
or
a
gentleman
of
the
chamber
will
always
win
*NL*
over
the
ultras
.
On
the
ship
of
state
every
one
is
anxious
to
take
over
*NL*
the
steering
because
it
is
well
paid
.
Will
there
be
never
a
poor
little
*NL*
place
for
the
simple
passenger
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
the
last
elections
which
are
forcing
you
out
of
the
province
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
misfortune
goes
further
back
.
Four
years
ago
I
was
forty
and
*NL*
possessed
500,000
francs
.
I
am
four
years
older
to-day
and
probably
*NL*
50,000
francs
to
the
bad
,
as
I
shall
lose
that
sum
on
the
sale
of
my
*NL*
chateau
of
Monfleury
in
a
superb
position
near
the
Rhone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Paris
I
was
tired
of
that
perpetual
comedy
which
is
rendered
*NL*
obligatory
by
what
you
call
nineteenth-century
civilisation
.
I
thirsted
*NL*
for
good
nature
and
simplicity
.
I
bought
an
estate
in
the
mountains
*NL*
near
the
Rhine
,
there
was
no
more
beautiful
place
under
the
heavens
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
village
clergyman
and
the
gentry
of
the
locality
pay
me
court
for
*NL*
six
months
;
I
invite
them
to
dinner
;
I
have
left
Paris
,
I
tell
them
,
so
*NL*
as
to
avoid
talking
politics
or
hearing
politics
talked
for
the
rest
of
*NL*
my
life
.
As
you
know
I
do
not
subscribe
to
any
paper
,
the
less
letters
*NL*
the
postman
brought
me
the
happier
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
did
not
suit
the
vicar
's
book
.
I
was
soon
the
victim
of
a
*NL*
thousand
unreasonable
requests
,
annoyances
,
etc.
.
I
wished
to
give
two
*NL*
or
three
hundred
francs
a
year
to
the
poor
,
I
was
asked
to
give
it
*NL*
to
the
Paris
associations
,
that
of
Saint
Joseph
,
that
of
the
Virgin
,
*NL*
etc.
.
I
refused
.
I
was
then
insulted
in
a
hundred
ways
.
I
was
foolish
*NL*
enough
to
be
upset
by
it
.
I
could
not
go
out
in
the
morning
to
enjoy
*NL*
the
beauty
of
our
mountain
without
finding
some
annoyance
which
*NL*
distracted
me
from
my
reveries
and
recalled
unpleasantly
both
men
and
*NL*
their
wickedness
.
On
the
Rogation
processions
,
for
instance
whose
*NL*
chanting
I
enjoy
-LRB-
it
is
probably
a
Greek
melody
-RRB-
they
will
not
bless
*NL*
my
fields
because
,
says
the
clergyman
,
they
belong
to
an
infidel
.
A
*NL*
cow
dies
belonging
to
a
devout
old
peasant
woman
.
She
says
the
reason
*NL*
is
the
neighbourhood
of
a
pond
which
belongs
to
my
infidel
self
,
a
*NL*
philosopher
coming
from
Paris
,
and
eight
days
afterwards
I
find
my
*NL*
fish
in
agonies
poisoned
by
lime
.
Intrigue
in
all
its
forms
envelops
*NL*
me
.
The
justice
of
the
peace
,
who
is
an
honest
man
,
but
frightened
of
*NL*
losing
his
place
,
always
decides
against
me
.
The
peace
of
the
country
*NL*
proved
a
hell
for
me
.
Once
they
saw
that
I
was
abandoned
by
the
vicar
,
*NL*
the
head
of
the
village
congregation
,
and
that
I
was
not
supported
by
*NL*
the
retired
captain
who
was
the
head
of
the
Liberals
they
all
fell
upon
*NL*
me
,
down
to
the
mason
whom
I
had
supported
for
a
year
,
down
to
the
very
*NL*
wheel-wright
who
wanted
to
cheat
me
with
impunity
over
the
repairing
of
*NL*
my
ploughs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
order
to
find
some
support
,
and
to
win
at
any
rate
some
of
my
law
*NL*
suits
I
became
a
Liberal
,
but
,
as
you
say
,
those
damned
elections
come
*NL*
along
.
They
asked
me
for
my
vote

``
For
an
unknown
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
for
a
man

I
knew
only
too
well

refused

was
*NL*
terribly
imprudent
.
From
that
moment
I
had
the
Liberals
on
my
hands
as
*NL*
well
,
and
my
position
became
intolerable
.
I
believe
that
if
the
vicar
*NL*
had
got
it
into
his
head
to
accuse
me
of
assassinating
my
servant
,
*NL*
there
would
be
twenty
witnesses
of
the
two
parties
who
would
swear
that
*NL*
they
had
seen
me
committing
the
crime

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
to
say
you
want
to
live
in
the
country

pandering

to
the
passions

your
neighbours
,
without
even
listening
to
their

gossip

What
a
mistake
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
rectified
at
last

Monfleury
is

I
will
lose
50,000

francs
if
necessary
,
but
I
am
over-joyed
I
am
leaving
that
hell
of
*NL*
hypocrisy
and
annoyance
.
I
am
going
to
look
for
solitude
and
rustic
*NL*
peace
in
the
only
place
where
those
things
are
to
be
found
in
France

on
a
fourth
storey
looking
on
to
the
Champs-Elysees

actually
deliberating

``
All
this

with
rage

sorrow

At
this
point
Julien

attention
was
redoubled

He
had
realised
from

the
first
word
that
the
Bonapartist
Falcoz
was
the
old
boyhood
friend
*NL*
of
M.
de
Renal

who
had
been
repudiated
by
him
in
1816

and
that
the
*NL*
philosopher
Saint-Giraud
must
be
the
brother

chief
of
the

prefecture
of

who
managed
to
get

knocked
down

n't
talk
evil
of
him
,
''
exclaimed
Falcoz
.
``
France
was
never
so
*NL*
high
in
the
esteem
of
the
nations
as
during
the
thirteen
years
of
his
*NL*
reign
;
then
every
single
act
was
great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
emperor
,
devil
take
him
,
''
replied
the
man
of
forty-four
,
``
was
*NL*
only
great
on
his
battle
fields
and
when
he
reorganised
the
finances
*NL*
about
1802
.
What
is
the
meaning
of
all
his
conduct
since
then
?
What
*NL*
with
his
chamberlains
,
his
pomp
,
and
his
receptions
in
the
Tuileries
,
*NL*
he
has
simply
provided
a
new
edition
of
all
the
monarchical
tomfoolery
.
*NL*
It
was
a
revised
edition
and
might
possibly
have
lasted
for
a
century
*NL*
or
two
.
The
nobles
and
the
priests
wish
to
go
back
to
the
old
one
,
but
*NL*
they
did
not
have
the
iron
hand
necessary
to
impose
it
on
the
public
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
just
how
an
old
printer
would
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
has
turned
me
out
of
my
estate
?
''
continued
the
printer
,
angrily
.
*NL*
``
The
priests
,
whom
Napoleon
called
back
by
his
Concordat
instead
*NL*
of
treating
them
like
the
State
treats
doctors
,
barristers
,
and
*NL*
astronomers
,
simply
seeing
in
them
ordinary
citizens
,
and
not
bothering
*NL*
about
the
particular
calling
by
which
they
are
trying
to
earn
their
*NL*
livelihood
.
Should
we
be
saddled
with
these
insolent
gentlemen
today
,
*NL*
if
your
Bonaparte
had
not
created
barons
and
counts
?
No
,
they
were
out
*NL*
of
fashion
.
Next
to
the
priests
,
it
's
the
little
country
nobility
who
*NL*
have
annoyed
me
the
most
,
and
compelled
me
to
become
a
Liberal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
was
endless
.
The
theme
will
occupy
France
for
another
*NL*
half-century
.
As
Saint-Giraud
kept
always
repeating
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
live
in
the
provinces
,
Julien
timidly
suggested
the
case
*NL*
of
M.
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zounds
,
young
man
,
you
're
a
nice
one
,
''
exclaimed
Falcoz
.
``
He
turned
*NL*
spider
so
as
not
to
be
fly
,
and
a
terrible
spider
into
the
bargain
.
*NL*
But
I
see
that
he
is
beaten
by
that
man
Valenod
.
Do
you
know
that
*NL*
scoundrel
?
He
's
the
villain
of
the
piece
.
What
will
your
M.
de
Renal
*NL*
say
if
he
sees
himself
turned
out
one
of
these
fine
days
,
and
Valenod
*NL*
put
in
his
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
be
left
to
brood
over
his
crimes
,
''
said
Saint-Giraud
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
know
Verrieres
,
young
man
?
Well
,
Bonaparte
,
heaven
confound
him
!
*NL*
Bonaparte
and
his
monarchical
tomfoolery
rendered
possible
the
reign
*NL*
of
the
Renals
and
the
Chelans
,
which
brought
about
the
reign
of
the
*NL*
Valenods
and
the
Maslons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
,
with
its
gloomy
politics
,
astonished
Julien
and
*NL*
distracted
him
from
his
delicious
reveries
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
appreciated
but
little
the
first
sight
of
Paris
as
perceived
in
the
*NL*
distance
.
The
castles
in
the
air
he
had
built
about
his
future
had
to
*NL*
struggle
with
the
still
present
memory
of
the
twenty-four
hours
that
*NL*
he
had
just
passed
in
Verrieres
.
He
vowed
that
he
would
never
abandon
*NL*
his
mistress
's
children
,
and
that
he
would
leave
everything
in
order
*NL*
to
protect
them
,
if
the
impertinence
of
the
priests
brought
about
a
*NL*
republic
and
the
persecution
of
the
nobles
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
have
happened
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
in
Verrieres
if
,
*NL*
at
the
moment
when
he
had
leant
his
ladder
against
the
casement
of
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
's
bedroom
he
had
found
that
room
occupied
by
a
stranger
*NL*
or
by
M.
de
Renal
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
delicious
,
too
,
had
been
those
first
two
hours
when
his
*NL*
sweetheart
had
been
sincerely
anxious
to
send
him
away
and
he
had
*NL*
pleaded
his
cause
,
sitting
down
by
her
in
the
darkness
!
A
soul
like
*NL*
Julien
's
is
haunted
by
such
memories
for
a
lifetime
.
The
rest
of
the
*NL*
interview
was
already
becoming
merged
in
the
first
period
of
their
*NL*
love
,
fourteen
months
previous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
awakened
from
his
deep
meditation
by
the
stopping
of
the
*NL*
coach
.
They
had
just
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
Post
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Rousseau
.
``
I
want
to
go
to
La
Malmaison
,
''
he
said
to
a
cabriolet
which
*NL*
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
time
,
Monsieur
--
what
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
got
to
do
with
you
?
Get
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
real
passion
only
thinks
about
itself
.
That
is
why
,
in
my
view
,
*NL*
passions
are
ridiculous
at
Paris
,
where
one
's
neighbour
always
insists
*NL*
on
one
's
considering
him
a
great
deal
.
I
shall
refrain
from
recounting
*NL*
Julien
's
ecstasy
at
La
Malmaison
.
He
wept
.
What
!
in
spite
of
those
*NL*
wretched
white
walls
,
built
this
very
year
,
which
cut
the
path
up
into
*NL*
bits
?
Yes
,
monsieur
,
for
Julien
,
as
for
posterity
,
there
was
nothing
to
*NL*
choose
between
Arcole
,
Saint
Helena
,
and
La
Malmaison
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
Julien
hesitated
a
great
deal
before
going
to
the
*NL*
theatre
.
He
had
strange
ideas
about
that
place
of
perdition
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
deep
distrust
prevented
him
from
admiring
actual
Paris
.
He
was
only
*NL*
affected
by
the
monuments
left
behind
by
his
hero
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
here
I
am
in
the
centre
of
intrigue
and
hypocrisy
.
Here
reign
the
*NL*
protectors
of
the
abbe
de
Frilair
.
''
On
the
evening
of
the
third
day
*NL*
his
curiosity
got
the
better
of
his
plan
of
seeing
everything
before
*NL*
presenting
himself
to
the
abbe
Pirard
.
The
abbe
explained
to
him
coldly
*NL*
the
kind
of
life
which
he
was
to
expect
at
M.
de
la
Mole
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
not
prove
useful
to
him
at
the
end
of
some
months
you
will
*NL*
go
back
to
the
seminary
,
but
not
in
disgrace
.
You
will
live
in
the
*NL*
house
of
the
marquis
,
who
is
one
of
the
greatest
seigneurs
of
France
.
*NL*
You
will
wear
black
,
but
like
a
man
who
is
in
mourning
,
and
not
like
*NL*
an
ecclesiastic
.
I
insist
on
your
following
your
theological
studies
*NL*
three
days
a
week
in
a
seminary
where
I
will
introduce
you
.
Every
day
*NL*
at
twelve
o'clock
you
will
establish
yourself
in
the
marquis
's
library
;
*NL*
he
counts
on
making
use
of
you
in
drafting
letters
concerning
his
*NL*
lawsuits
and
other
matters
.
The
marquis
will
scribble
on
the
margin
*NL*
of
each
letter
he
gets
the
kind
of
answer
which
is
required
.
I
have
*NL*
assured
him
that
at
the
end
of
three
months
you
will
be
so
competent
to
*NL*
draft
the
answers
,
that
out
of
every
dozen
you
hand
to
the
marquis
for
*NL*
signature
,
he
will
be
able
to
sign
eight
or
nine
.
In
the
evening
,
at
*NL*
eight
o'clock
,
you
will
tidy
up
his
bureau
,
and
at
ten
you
will
be
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
,
''
continued
the
abbe
Pirard
,
``
that
some
old
lady
or
some
*NL*
smooth-voiced
man
will
hint
at
immense
advantages
,
or
will
crudely
*NL*
offer
you
gold
,
to
show
him
the
letters
which
the
marquis
has
received
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
singular
,
''
said
the
abbe
with
a
bitter
smile
,
``
that
poor
as
*NL*
you
are
,
and
after
a
year
at
a
seminary
,
you
still
have
any
of
this
*NL*
virtuous
indignation
left
.
You
must
have
been
very
blind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
that
blood
will
tell
,
''
muttered
the
abbe
in
a
whisper
,
as
*NL*
though
speaking
to
himself
.
``
The
singular
thing
is
,
''
he
added
,
looking
*NL*
at
Julien
,
``
that
the
marquis
knows
you
--
I
do
n't
know
how
.
He
will
give
*NL*
you
a
salary
of
a
hundred
louis
to
commence
with
.
He
is
a
man
who
only
*NL*
acts
by
his
whim
.
That
is
his
weakness
.
He
will
quarrel
with
you
about
*NL*
the
most
childish
matters
.
If
he
is
satisfied
,
your
wages
may
rise
in
*NL*
consequence
up
to
eight
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
realise
,
''
went
on
the
abbe
,
sourly
,
``
that
he
is
not
giving
*NL*
you
all
this
money
simply
on
account
of
your
personal
charm
.
The
thing
*NL*
is
to
prove
yourself
useful
.
If
I
were
in
your
place
I
would
talk
very
*NL*
little
,
and
I
would
never
talk
about
what
I
know
nothing
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
the
abbe
,
``
I
have
made
some
enquiries
for
you
.
I
was
*NL*
forgetting
M.
de
la
Mole
's
family
.
He
has
two
children
--
a
daughter
and
*NL*
a
son
of
nineteen
,
eminently
elegant
--
the
kind
of
madman
who
never
*NL*
knows
to-day
what
he
will
do
to-morrow
.
He
has
spirit
and
valour
;
he
*NL*
has
been
through
the
Spanish
war
.
The
marquis
hopes
,
I
do
n't
know
why
,
*NL*
that
you
will
become
a
friend
of
the
young
count
Norbert
.
I
told
him
*NL*
that
you
were
a
great
classic
,
and
possibly
he
reckons
on
your
teaching
*NL*
his
son
some
ready-made
phrases
about
Cicero
and
Virgil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
you
,
I
should
never
allow
that
handsome
young
man
to
make
*NL*
fun
of
me
,
and
before
I
accepted
his
advances
,
which
you
will
find
*NL*
perfectly
polite
but
a
little
ironical
,
I
would
make
him
repeat
them
*NL*
more
than
once

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
hide
from
you
the
fact
that
the
young
count
de
La
Mole
is
*NL*
bound
to
despise
you
at
first
,
because
you
are
nothing
more
than
a
*NL*
little
bourgeois
.
His
grandfather
belonged
to
the
court
,
and
had
the
*NL*
honour
of
having
his
head
cut
off
in
the
Place
de
Greve
on
the
26th
*NL*
April
,
1574
,
on
account
of
a
political
intrigue

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for

a
carpenter
of
Verrieres

and
what
*NL*
is
more

in
receipt
of
his
father
's
wages
.
Ponder
well
over
these
*NL*
differences
,
and
look
up
the
family
history
in
Moreri
.
All
the
*NL*
flatterers
who
dine
at
their
house
make
from
time
to
time
what

call
delicate
allusions

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me

said
Julien
,
blushing
violently
,
``

*NL*
Julien
was
overwhelmed
by
the
bitter
and
almost
vindictive
tone
which
*NL*
he
noticed
in
M.
Pirard
;
that
tone
completely
infected
his
last
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
is
that
the
abbe
had
a
conscientious
scruple
about
loving
*NL*
Julien
,
and
it
was
with
a
kind
of
religious
fear
that
he
took
so
direct
*NL*
a
part
in
another
's
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
also
see
,
''
he
added
with
the
same
bad
grace
,
as
though
*NL*
accomplishing
a
painful
duty
,
``
you
also
will
see
Madame
the
marquise
*NL*
de
La
Mole
.
She
is
a
big
blonde
woman
about
forty
,
devout
,
perfectly
*NL*
polite
,
and
even
more
insignificant
.
She
is
the
daughter
of
the
old
*NL*
Duke
de
Chaulnes
so
well
known
for
his
aristocratic
prejudices
.
This
*NL*
great
lady
is
a
kind
of
synopsis
in
high
relief
of
all
the
fundamental
*NL*
characteristics
of
women
of
her
rank
.
She
does
not
conceal
for
her
own
*NL*
part
that
the
possession
of
ancestors
who
went
through
the
crusades
*NL*
is
the
sole
advantage
which
she
respects

Money
only
comes
a
long
way
*NL*
afterwards

Does
that
astonish
you

will
see
many
great

a
tone

singular
flippancy

As
for
Madame

she
lowers
her
*NL*
voice
out
of
respect
every
time
she
mentions
the
name
of

*NL*
above
all
the
name
of
a

I
would
not
advise
you

say
in

hearing
that
Philip

monsters

indisputable

added
M.
Pirard
,
``

said
Julien
,
``
I
do
not

I
shall
be
long
at

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
but
remember
that
no
man
of
our
class
can
make
his
fortune
*NL*
except
through
the
great
lords
.
With
that
indefinable
element
in
your
*NL*
character
,
at
any
rate
I
think
it
is
,
you
will
be
persecuted
if
you
*NL*
do
not
make
your
fortune
.
There
is
no
middle
course
for
you
,
make
no
*NL*
mistake
about
it
;
people
see
that
they
do
not
give
you
pleasure
when
*NL*
they
speak
to
you
;
in
a
social
country
like
this
you
are
condemned
to
*NL*
unhappiness
if
you
do
not
succeed
in
winning
respect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
have
become
of
you
at
Besancon
without
this
whim
of
the
*NL*
marquis
de
la
Mole
?
One
day
you
will
realise
the
extraordinary
extent
*NL*
of
what
he
has
done
for
you
,
and
if
you
are
not
a
monster
you
will
be
*NL*
eternally
grateful
to
him
and
his
family
.
How
many
poor
abbes
more
*NL*
learned
than
you
have
lived
years
at
Paris
on
the
fifteen
sous
they
*NL*
got
for
their
mass
and
their
ten
sous
they
got
for
their
dissertations
*NL*
in
the
Sorbonne
.
Remember
what
I
told
you
last
winter
about
the
first
*NL*
years
of
that
bad
man
Cardinal
Dubois
.
Are
you
proud
enough
by
chance
*NL*
to
think
yourself
more
talented
than
he
was
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
,
for
instance
,
a
quiet
and
average
man
like
myself
;
I
reckoned
*NL*
on
dying
in
my
seminary
.
I
was
childish
enough
to
get
attached
to
*NL*
it
.
Well
I
was
on
the
point
of
being
turned
out
,
when
I
handed
in
*NL*
my
resignation
.
You
know
what
my
fortune
consisted
of
.
I
had
five
*NL*
hundred
and
twenty
francs
capital
neither
more
nor
less
,
not
a
friend
,
*NL*
scarcely
two
or
three
acquaintances
.
M.
de
la
Mole
,
whom
I
had
never
*NL*
seen
,
extricated
me
from
that
quandary
.
He
only
had
to
say
the
word
*NL*
and
I
was
given
a
living
where
the
parishioners
are
well-to-do
people
*NL*
above
all
crude
vices
,
and
where
the
income
puts
me
to
shame
,
it
is
so
*NL*
disproportionate
to
my
work
.
I
refrained
from
talking
to
you
all
this
*NL*
time
simply
to
enable
you
to
find
your
level
a
bit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
word
more
,
I
have
the
misfortune
to
be
irritable
.
It
is
possible
*NL*
that
you
and
I
will
cease
to
be
on
speaking
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
airs
of
the
marquise
or
the
spiteful
pleasantries
of
her
son
*NL*
make
the
house
absolutely
intolerable
for
you
I
advise
you
to
finish
*NL*
your
studies
in
some
seminary
thirty
leagues
from
Paris
and
rather
*NL*
north
than
south
.
There
is
more
civilisation
in
the
north
,
and
,
he
*NL*
added
lowering
his
voice
,
I
must
admit
that
the
nearness
of
the
Paris
*NL*
papers
puts
fear
into
our
petty
tyrants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
continue
to
find
pleasure
in
each
other
's
society
and
if
the
*NL*
marquis
's
house
does
not
suit
you
,
I
will
offer
you
the
post
of
my
*NL*
curate
,
and
will
go
equal
shares
with
you
in
what
I
get
from
the
*NL*
living
.
I
owe
you
that
and
even
more
,
he
added
interrupting
Julien
's
*NL*
thanks
,
for
the
extraordinary
offer
which
you
made
me
at
Besancon
.
If
*NL*
instead
of
having
five
hundred
and
twenty
francs
I
had
had
nothing
you
*NL*
would
have
saved
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
's
voice
had
lost
its
tone
of
cruelty
,
Julien
was
ashamed
to
*NL*
feel
tears
in
his
eyes
.
He
was
desperately
anxious
to
throw
himself
*NL*
into
his
friend
's
arms
.
He
could
not
help
saying
to
him
in
the
most
*NL*
manly
manner
he
could
assume
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
hated
by
my
father
from
the
cradle
;
it
was
one
of
my
great
*NL*
misfortunes
,
but
I
shall
no
longer
complain
of
my
luck
,
I
have
found
*NL*
another
father
in
you
,
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
good
,
that
is
good
,
''
said
the
embarrassed
abbe
,
then
suddenly
*NL*
remembering
quite
appropriately
a
seminary
platitude
``
you
must
never
*NL*
say
luck
,
my
child
,
always
say
providence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fiacre
stopped
.
The
coachman
lifted
up
the
bronze
knocker
of
an
*NL*
immense
door
.
It
was
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
,
and
to
prevent
the
passers
*NL*
by
having
any
doubt
on
the
subject
these
words
could
be
read
in
black
*NL*
marble
over
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
affectation
displeased
Julien
.
``
They
are
so
frightened
of
the
*NL*
Jacobins
.
They
see
a
Robespierre
and
his
tumbril
behind
every
head
.
*NL*
Their
panic
is
often
gloriously
grotesque
and
they
advertise
their
*NL*
house
like
this
so
that
in
the
event
of
a
rising
the
rabble
can
*NL*
recognise
it
and
loot
it
.
''
He
communicated
his
thought
to
the
abbe
*NL*
Pirard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
poor
child
,
you
will
soon
be
my
curate
.
What
a
dreadful
idea
you
*NL*
have
got
into
your
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
could
be
simpler
,
''
said
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gravity
of
the
porter
,
and
above
all
,
the
cleanness
of
the
the
*NL*
court
,
struck
him
with
admiration
.
It
was
fine
sunshine
.
``
What
*NL*
magnificent
architecture
,
''
he
said
to
his
friend
.
The
hotel
in
question
*NL*
was
one
of
those
buildings
of
the
Faubourg
Saint-Germain
with
a
flat
*NL*
facade
built
about
the
time
of
Voltaire
's
death
.
At
no
other
period
had
*NL*
fashion
and
beauty
been
so
far
from
one
another

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
ENTRY
INTO
SOCIETY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ludicrous
and
pathetic
memory
:
the
first
drawing-room
*NL*
where
one
appeared
alone
and
without
support
at
the
*NL*
age
of
eighteen
!
the
look
of
a
woman
sufficed
to
*NL*
intimidate
me
.
The
more
I
wished
to
please
the
more
*NL*
clumsy
I
became
.
I
evolved
the
most
unfounded
ideas
*NL*
about
everything
.
I
would
either
abandon
myself
without
*NL*
any
reason
,
or
I
would
regard
a
man
as
an
enemy
simply
*NL*
because
he
had
looked
at
me
with
a
serious
air
;
but
*NL*
all
the
same
,
in
the
middle
of
the
unhappiness
of
*NL*
my
timidity
,
how
beautiful
did
I
find
a
beautiful
*NL*
day
--
_
Kant
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
stopped
in
amazement
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
.
``
Pull
*NL*
yourself
together
,
''
said
the
abbe
Pirard
.
``
You
get
horrible
ideas
into
*NL*
your
head
,
besides
you
are
only
a
child
.
What
has
happened
to
the
*NL*
nil
mirari
of
Horace
-LRB-
no
enthusiasm
-RRB-
remember
that
when
they
see
you
*NL*
established
here
this
crowd
of
lackeys
will
make
fun
of
you
.
They
will
*NL*
see
in
you
an
equal
who
has
been
unjustly
placed
above
them
;
and
,
under
*NL*
a
masquerade
of
good
advice
and
a
desire
to
help
you
,
they
will
try
to
*NL*
make
you
fall
into
some
gross
blunder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
do
their
worst
,
''
said
Julien
biting
his
lip
,
and
he
became
as
*NL*
distrustful
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
salons
on
the
first
storey
which
our
gentlemen
went
through
before
*NL*
reaching
the
marquis
'
study
,
would
have
seemed
to
you
,
my
reader
,
as
*NL*
gloomy
as
they
were
magnificent
.
If
they
had
been
given
to
you
just
as
*NL*
they
were
,
you
would
have
refused
to
live
in
them
.
This
was
the
domain
*NL*
of
yawning
and
melancholy
reasoning
.
They
redoubled
Julien
's
rapture
.
*NL*
``
How
can
any
one
be
unhappy
?
''
he
thought
,
``
who
lives
in
so
splendid
an
*NL*
abode
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
our
gentlemen
arrived
at
the
ugliest
rooms
in
this
superb
*NL*
suite
.
There
was
scarcely
any
light
.
They
found
there
a
little
keen
*NL*
man
with
a
lively
eye
and
a
blonde
wig
.
The
abbe
turned
round
*NL*
to
Julien
and
presented
him
.
It
was
the
marquis
.
Julien
had
much
*NL*
difficulty
in
recognising
him
,
he
found
his
manner
was
so
polite
.
*NL*
It
was
no
longer
the
grand
seigneur
with
that
haughty
manner
of
the
*NL*
abbey
of
Bray-le-Haut
.
Julien
thought
that
his
wig
had
much
too
many
*NL*
hairs
.
As
the
result
of
this
opinion
he
was
not
at
all
intimidated
.
*NL*
The
descendant
of
the
friend
of
Henry
III
.
seemed
to
him
at
first
of
*NL*
a
rather
insignificant
appearance
.
He
was
extremely
thin
and
very
*NL*
restless
,
but
he
soon
noticed
that
the
marquis
had
a
politeness
which
*NL*
was
even
more
pleasant
to
his
listener
than
that
of
the
Bishop
of
*NL*
Besancon
himself
.
The
audience
only
lasted
three
minutes
.
As
they
went
*NL*
out
the
abbe
said
to
Julien
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
looked
at
the
marquis
just
as
you
would
have
looked
at
a
picture
.
*NL*
I
am
not
a
great
expert
in
what
these
people
here
call
politeness
.
You
*NL*
will
soon
know
more
about
it
than
I
do
,
but
really
the
boldness
of
your
*NL*
looks
seemed
scarcely
polite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
got
back
into
the
fiacre
.
The
driver
stopped
near
the
*NL*
boulevard
;
the
abbe
ushered
Julien
into
a
suite
of
large
rooms
.
Julien
*NL*
noticed
that
there
was
no
furniture
.
He
was
looking
at
the
magnificent
*NL*
gilded
clock
representing
a
subject
which
he
thought
very
indecent
,
*NL*
when
a
very
elegant
gentleman
approached
him
with
a
smiling
air
.
Julien
*NL*
bowed
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
smiled
and
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
Julien
shuddered
*NL*
and
leapt
back
,
he
reddened
with
rage
.
The
abbe
Pirard
,
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
gravity
,
laughed
till
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
.
The
gentleman
was
a
*NL*
tailor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
your
liberty
for
two
days
,
''
said
the
abbe
as
they
went
*NL*
out
.
``
You
can
not
be
introduced
before
then
to
Madame
de
la
Mole
.
Any
*NL*
one
else
would
watch
over
you
as
if
you
were
a
young
girl
during
these
*NL*
first
few
moments
of
your
life
in
this
new
Babylon
.
Get
ruined
at
once
*NL*
if
you
have
got
to
be
ruined
,
and
I
will
be
rid
of
my
own
weakness
of
*NL*
being
fond
of
you
.
The
day
after
to-morrow
this
tailor
will
bring
you
*NL*
two
suits
,
you
will
give
the
man
who
tries
them
on
five
francs
.
Apart
*NL*
from
that
do
n't
let
these
Parisians
hear
the
sound
of
your
voice
.
If
*NL*
you
say
a
word
they
will
manage
somehow
to
make
fun
of
you
.
They
have
a
*NL*
talent
for
it
.
Come
and
see
me
the
day
after
to-morrow
at
noon
...
Go
*NL*
and
ruin
yourself
...
I
was
forgetting
,
go
and
order
boots
and
a
hat
at
*NL*
these
addresses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
scrutinised
the
handwriting
of
the
addresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
marquis
's
hand
,
''
said
the
abbe
;
``
he
is
an
energetic
man
who
*NL*
foresees
everything
,
and
prefers
doing
to
ordering
.
He
is
taking
you
*NL*
into
his
house
,
so
that
you
may
spare
him
that
kind
of
trouble
.
Will
*NL*
you
have
enough
brains
to
execute
efficiently
all
the
instructions
*NL*
which
he
will
give
you
with
scarcely
a
word
of
explanation
?
The
future
*NL*
will
show
,
look
after
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
entered
the
shops
indicated
by
the
addresses
without
saying
a
*NL*
single
word
.
He
observed
that
he
was
received
with
respect
,
and
that
*NL*
the
bootmaker
as
he
wrote
his
name
down
in
the
ledger
put
M.
de
Sorel
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
in
the
Cemetery
of
Pere
La
Chaise
a
very
obliging
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
what
is
more
,
one
who
was
Liberal
in
his
views
,
*NL*
suggested
that
he
should
show
Julien
the
tomb
of
Marshal
Ney
which
a
*NL*
sagacious
statecraft
had
deprived
of
the
honour
of
an
epitaph
,
but
when
*NL*
he
left
this
Liberal
,
who
with
tears
in
his
eyes
almost
clasped
him
in
*NL*
his
arms
,
Julien
was
without
his
watch
.
Enriched
by
this
experience
two
*NL*
days
afterwards
he
presented
himself
to
the
abbe
Pirard
,
who
looked
at
*NL*
him
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
are
going
to
become
a
fop
,
''
said
the
abbe
to
him
severely
.
*NL*
Julien
looked
like
a
very
young
man
in
full
mourning
;
as
a
matter
of
*NL*
fact
,
he
looked
very
well
,
but
the
good
abbe
was
too
provincial
himself
*NL*
to
see
that
Julien
still
carried
his
shoulders
in
that
particular
way
*NL*
which
signifies
in
the
provinces
both
elegance
and
importance
.
When
the
*NL*
marquis
saw
Julien
his
opinion
of
his
graces
differed
so
radically
from
*NL*
that
of
the
good
abbe
as
he
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
have
any
objection
to
M.
le
Sorel
taking
some
dancing
*NL*
lessons
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
was
thunderstruck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
at
last
.
``
Julien
is
not
a
priest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
went
up
the
steps
of
a
little
secret
staircase
two
at
a
*NL*
time
,
and
installed
our
hero
in
a
pretty
attic
which
looked
out
on
the
*NL*
big
garden
of
the
hotel
.
He
asked
him
how
many
shirts
he
had
got
at
the
*NL*
linen
drapers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
,
''
answered
Julien
,
intimidated
at
seeing
so
great
a
lord
*NL*
condescend
to
such
details
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
replied
the
marquis
quite
seriously
,
and
with
a
certain
*NL*
curt
imperiousness
which
gave
Julien
food
for
thought
.
``
Very
good
,
get
*NL*
twenty-two
more
shirts
.
Here
are
your
first
quarter
's
wages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
down
from
the
attic
the
marquis
called
an
old
man
.
``
Arsene
,
''
*NL*
he
said
to
him
,
``
you

Sorel

''
A
few
minutes
afterwards
*NL*
Julien
found
himself
alone
in
a
magnificent
library
.
It
was
a
delicious
*NL*
moment
.
To
prevent
his
emotion
being
discovered
he
went
and
hid
in
*NL*
a
little
dark
corner
.
From
there
he
contemplated
with
rapture
the
*NL*
brilliant
backs
of
the
books
.
``
I
shall
be
able
to
read
all
these
,
''
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
.
``
How
can
I
fail
to
like
it
here
?
M.
de
Renal
would
*NL*
have
thought
himself
dishonoured
for
ever
by
doing
one-hundredth
part
*NL*
of
what
the
Marquis
de
la
Mole
has
just
done
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
let
me
have
a
look
at
the
copies
I
have
to
make
.
''
Having
finished
*NL*
this
work
Julien
ventured
to
approach
the
books
.
He
almost
went
mad
*NL*
with
joy
as
he
opened
an
edition
of
Voltaire
.
He
ran
and
opened
the
*NL*
door
of
the
library
to
avoid
being
surprised
.
He
then
indulged
in
the
*NL*
luxury
of
opening
each
of
the
eighty
volumes
.
They
were
magnificently
*NL*
bound
and
were
the
masterpiece
of
the
best
binder
in
London
.
It
was
*NL*
even
more
than
was
required
to
raise
Julien
's
admiration
to
the
maximum
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
afterwards
the
marquis
came
in
and
was
surprised
to
notice
that
*NL*
Julien
spelt
cela
with
two
``
ll
''
cella
.
``
Is
all
that
the
abbe
told
me
of
*NL*
his
knowledge
simply
a
fairy
tale
?
''
The
marquis
was
greatly
discouraged
*NL*
and
gently
said
to
him
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
sure
of
your
spelling
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Julien
without
thinking
in
the
least
of
the
*NL*
injustice
that
he
was
doing
to
himself
.
He
was
overcome
by
the
kindness
*NL*
of
the
marquis
which
recalled
to
him
through
sheer
force
of
contrast
*NL*
the
superciliousness
of
M.
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
trial
of
the
little
Franc-comtois
abbe
is
waste
of
time
,
''
thought
*NL*
the
marquis
,
``
but
I
had
such
great
need
of
a
reliable
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
spell
cela
with
one
`
l
,
'
''
said
the
marquis
to
him
,
``
and
when
you
*NL*
have
finished
your
copies
look
the
words
whose
spelling
you
are
not
*NL*
sure
of
up
in
the
dictionary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
sent
for
him
at
six
o'clock
.
He
looked
at
Julien
's
boots
*NL*
with
manifest
pain
.
``
I
am
sorry
for
a
mistake
I
made
.
I
did
not
tell
*NL*
you
that
you
must
dress
every
day
at
half-past
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
looked
at
him
but
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
say
put
on
stockings
.
Arsene
will
remind
you
.
To-day
I
will
*NL*
make
your
apologies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
finished
the
sentence
M.
de
la
Mole
escorted
Julien
into
a
salon
*NL*
resplendent
with
gilding
.
On
similar
occasions
M.
de
Renal
always
made
*NL*
a
point
of
doubling
his
pace
so
as
to
have
the
privilege
of
being
the
*NL*
first
to
pass
the
threshold
.
His
former
employer
's
petty
vanity
caused
*NL*
Julien
to
tread
on
the
marquis
's
feet
and
hurt
him
a
great
deal
because
*NL*
of
his
gout
.
``
So
he
is
clumsy
to
the
bargain
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
He
*NL*
presented
him
to
a
woman
of
high
stature
and
of
imposing
appearance
.
*NL*
It
was
the
marquise
.
Julien
thought
that
her
manner
was
impertinent
,
*NL*
and
that
she
was
a
little
like
Madame
de
Maugiron
,
the
wife
of
the
*NL*
sub-prefect
of
the
arrondissement
of
Verrieres
when
she
was
present
*NL*
at
the
Saint-Charles
dinner
.
Rendered
somewhat
nervous
by
the
extreme
*NL*
magnificence
of
the
salon
Julien
did
not
hear
what
M.
de
la
Mole
was
*NL*
saying
.
The
marquise
scarcely
deigned
to
look
at
him
.
There
were
*NL*
several
men
there
,
among
whom
Julien
recognised
with
an
inexpressible
*NL*
pleasure
the
young
bishop
of
Agde
who
had
deigned
to
speak
to
him
some
*NL*
months
before
at
the
ceremony
of
Bray-le-Haut
.
This
young
prelate
was
*NL*
doubtless
frightened
by
the
tender
look
which
the
timidity
of
Julien
*NL*
fixed
on
him
,
and
did
not
bother
to
recognise
``
the
provincial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
assembled
in
this
salon
seemed
to
Julien
to
have
a
certain
*NL*
element
of
gloom
and
constraint
.
Conversation
takes
place
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
in
Paris
and
little
details
are
not
exaggerated
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
handsome
young
man
with
moustaches
,
came
in
about
half-past
six
.
He
*NL*
was
very
pale
,
and
had
a
very
small
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
keep
us
waiting
''
said
the
marquise
,
as
he
kissed
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
realised
that
it
was
the
Count
de
la
Mole
.
From
the
very
first
*NL*
he
thought
he
was
charming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
''
he
said
to
himself
``
that
this
is
the
man
whose
*NL*
offensive
jests
are
going
to
drive
me
out
of
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
result
of
scrutinising
count
Norbert
,
Julien
noticed
that
he
*NL*
was
in
boots
and
spurs
.
``
And
I
have
got
to
be
in
shoes
just
like
*NL*
an
inferior
apparently
.
''
They
sat
down
at
table
,
Julien
heard
the
*NL*
marquise
raising
her
voice
a
little
and
saying
something
severe
.
Almost
*NL*
simultaneously
he
noticed
an
extremely
blonde
and
very
well
developed
*NL*
young
person
who
had
just
sat
down
opposite
him
.
Nevertheless
she
*NL*
made
no
appeal
to
him
.
Looking
at
her
attentively
he
thought
that
he
*NL*
had
never
seen
such
beautiful
eyes
,
although
they
betokened
a
great
*NL*
coldness
of
soul
.
Subsequently
Julien
thought
that
,
though
they
*NL*
looked
bored
and
sceptical
,
they
were
conscious
of
the
duty
of
being
*NL*
impressive
.
``
Madame
de
Renal
of
course
had
very
fine
eyes
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
she
used
to
be
universally
complimented
on
them
,
but
they
had
*NL*
nothing
in
common
with
these
.
''
Julien
did
not
know
enough
of
society
*NL*
to
appreciate
that
it
was
the
fire
of
repartee
which
from
time
to
time
*NL*
gave
their
brilliancy
to
the
eyes
of
Mademoiselle
Mathilde
-LRB-
for
that
*NL*
was
the
name
he
heard
her
called
by
-RRB-
.
When
Madame
de
Renal
's
eyes
*NL*
became
animated
,
it
was
with
the
fire
of
passion
,
or
as
the
result
of
a
*NL*
generous
indignation
on
hearing
of
some
evil
deed
.
Towards
the
end
of
*NL*
the
meal
Julien
found
a
word
to
express
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
type
*NL*
of
beauty
.
Her
eyes
are
scintillating
,
he
said
to
himself
.
Apart
from
*NL*
her
eyes
she
was
cruelly
like
her
mother
,
whom
he
liked
less
and
less
,
*NL*
and
he
ceased
looking
at
her
.
By
way
of
compensation
he
thought
Count
*NL*
Norbert
admirable
in
every
respect
.
Julien
was
so
fascinated
that
the
*NL*
idea
never
occurred
to
him
of
being
jealous
,
and
hating
him
because
he
*NL*
was
richer
and
of
nobler
birth
than
he
was
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
thought
that
the
marquis
looked
bored
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
second
course
he
said
to
his
son
:
``
Norbert
,
I
ask
all
your
*NL*
good
offices
for
M.
Julien
Sorel
,
whom
I
have
just
taken
into
my
staff
*NL*
and
of
whom
I
hope
to
make
a
man
_
si
cella
se
peut
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
my
secretary
,
''
said
the
marquis
to
his
neighbour
,
``
and
he
spells
*NL*
cela
with
two
ll
's
.
''
Everybody
looked
at
Julien
,
who
bowed
to
Norbert
*NL*
in
a
manner
that
was
slightly
too
marked
,
but
speaking
generally
they
*NL*
were
satisfied
with
his
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
must
have
spoken
about
the
kind
of
education
which
Julien
*NL*
had
received
for
one
of
the
guests
tackled
him
on
Horace
.
``
It
was
*NL*
just
by
talking
about
Horace
that
I
succeeded
with
the
bishop
of
*NL*
Besancon
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
Apparently
that
is
the
only
author
*NL*
they
know
.
From
that
instant
he
was
master
of
himself
.
This
transition
*NL*
was
rendered
easy
because
he
had
just
decided
that
he
would
never
look
*NL*
upon
Madamoiselle
de
la
Mole
as
a
woman
after
his
own
taste
.
Since
the
*NL*
seminary
he
had
the
lowest
opinion
of
men
,
and
was
not
to
be
easily
*NL*
intimidated
by
them
.
He
would
have
enjoyed
all
his
self-possession
if
*NL*
the
dining-room
had
been
furnished
with
less
magnificence
.
It
was
,
*NL*
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
two
mirrors
each
eight
feet
high
in
which
he
*NL*
would
look
from
time
to
time
at
the
man
who
was
speaking
to
him
about
*NL*
Horace
,
which
continued
to
impress
him
.
His
phrases
were
not
too
long
*NL*
for
a
provincial
,
he
had
fine
eyes
whose
brilliancy
was
doubled
by
his
*NL*
quavering
timidity
,
or
by
his
happy
bashfulness
when
he
had
given
a
*NL*
good
answer
.
They
found
him
pleasant
.
This
kind
of
examination
gave
*NL*
a
little
interest
to
a
solemn
dinner
.
The
marquis
signed
to
Julien
's
*NL*
questioner
to
press
him
sharply
.
``
Can
he
possibly
know
something
?
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
answered
and
thought
out
new
ideas
.
He
lost
sufficient
of
his
*NL*
nervousness
,
not
indeed
to
exhibit
any
wit
,
for
that
is
impossible
*NL*
for
any
one
ignorant
of
the
special
language
which
is
used
in
Paris
,
*NL*
but
to
show
himself
possessed
of
ideas
which
,
though
presented
out
of
*NL*
place
and
ungracefully
,
were
yet
original
.
They
saw
that
he
knew
Latin
*NL*
perfectly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
adversary
was
a
member
of
the
Academy
Inscriptions
who
chanced
*NL*
to
know
Latin
.
He
found
Julien
a
very
good
humanist
,
was
not
frightened
*NL*
of
making
him
feel
uncomfortable
,
and
really
tried
to
embarrass
him
.
In
*NL*
the
heat
of
the
controversy
Julien
eventually
forgot
the
magnificent
*NL*
furniture
of
the
dining-room
.
He
managed
to
expound
theories
concerning
*NL*
the
Latin
poets
which
his
questioner
had
never
read
of
anywhere
.
Like
*NL*
an
honest
man
,
he
gave
the
young
secretary
all
due
credit
for
them
.
*NL*
As
luck
would
have
it
,
they
started
a
discussion
on
the
question
*NL*
of
whether
Horace
was
poor
or
rich
,
a
good
humoured
and
careless
*NL*
voluptuary
who
made
verses
to
amuse
himself
,
like
Chapelle
the
friend
*NL*
of
Moliere
and
de
la
Fontaine
,
or
a
poor
devil
of
a
poet
laureate
who
*NL*
wrote
odes
for
the
king
's
birthday
like
Southey
,
the
accuser
of
Lord
*NL*
Byron
.
They
talked
about
the
state
of
society
under
Augustus
and
under
*NL*
George
IV
.
At
both
periods
the
aristocracy
was
all-powerful
,
but
,
*NL*
while
at
Rome
it
was
despoiled
of
its
power
by
Maecenas
who
was
only
a
*NL*
simple
knight
,
it
had
in
England
reduced
George
IV
practically
to
the
*NL*
position
of
a
Venetian
doge
.
This
discussion
seemed
to
lift
the
marquis
*NL*
out
of
that
state
of
bored
torpor
in
which
he
had
been
plunged
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
found
meaningless
such
modern
names
as
Southey
,
Lord
Byron
,
*NL*
and
George
IV
,
which
he
now
heard
pronounced
for
the
first
time
.
But
*NL*
every
one
noticed
that
whenever
the
conversation
dealt
with
events
that
*NL*
had
taken
place
in
Rome
and
about
which
knowledge
could
be
obtained
*NL*
by
a
perusal
of
the
works
of
Horace
,
Martial
or
Tacitus
,
etc.
,
he
*NL*
showed
an
indisputable
superiority
.
Julien
coolly
appropriated
several
*NL*
ideas
which
he
had
learnt
from
the
bishop
of
Besancon
in
the
historic
*NL*
conversation
which
he
had
had
with
that
prelate
.
These
ideas
were
not
*NL*
the
least
appreciated
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
every
one
was
tired
of
talking
about
poets
the
marquise
,
who
*NL*
always
made
it
a
rule
to
admire
whatever
amused
her
husband
,
deigned
*NL*
to
look
at
Julien
.
``
Perhaps
an
educated
man
lies
hid
beneath
the
*NL*
clumsy
manners
of
this
young
abbe
,
''
said
the
Academician
who
happened
*NL*
to
be
near
the
marquise
.
Julien
caught
a
few
words
of
what
he
said
.
*NL*
Ready-made
phrases
suited
the
intellect
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
*NL*
quite
well
.
She
adopted
this
one
about
Julien
,
and
was
very
pleased
*NL*
with
herself
for
having
invited
the
academician
to
dinner
.
``
He
has
*NL*
amused
M.
de
la
Mole
''
she
thought
.

*NL*
Julien
was
copying
letters
in
the
library
very
early
the
next
day
*NL*
when
Mademoiselle
Mathilde
came
in
by
a
little
dummy
door
very
well
*NL*
masked
by
the
backs
of
the
books
.
While
Julien
was
admiring
the
*NL*
device
,
Mademoiselle
Mathilde
seemed
astonished
and
somewhat
annoyed
*NL*
at
finding
him
there
:
Julien
saw
that
she
was
in
curl-papers
and
had
*NL*
a
hard
,
haughty
,
and
masculine
expression
.
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
*NL*
had
the
habit
of
surreptitiously
stealing
books
from
her
father
's
*NL*
library
.
Julien
's
presence
rendered
this
morning
's
journey
abortive
,
*NL*
a
fact
which
annoyed
her
all
the
more
as
she
had
come
to
fetch
the
*NL*
second
volume
of
Voltaire
's
_
Princess
of
Babylon
_
,
a
worthy
climax
to
*NL*
one
of
the
most
eminently
monarchical
and
religious
educations
which
*NL*
the
convent
of
the
Sacred
Heart
had
ever
provided
.
This
poor
girl
of
*NL*
nineteen
already
required
some
element
of
spiciness
in
order
to
get
up
*NL*
an
interest
in
a
novel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Norbert
put
in
an
appearance
in
the
library
about
three
o'clock
.
*NL*
He
had
come
to
study
a
paper
so
as
to
be
able
to
talk
politics
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
and
was
very
glad
to
meet
Julien
,
whose
existence
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
.
He
was
charming
,
and
offered
him
a
ride
on
horseback
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
will
excuse
us
until
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
appreciated
the
us
and
thought
it
charming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
heavens
!
M.
le
Comte
,
''
said
Julien
,
``
if
it
were
a
question
of
*NL*
felling
an
eighty-foot
tree
or
hewing
it
out
and
making
it
into
planks
*NL*
I
would
acquit
myself
all
right
,
I
daresay
,
but
as
for
riding
a
horse
,
*NL*
I
have
n't
done
such
a
thing
six
times
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
will
be
the
seventh
,
''
said
Norbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
Julien
remembered
the
king
of
--
's
entry
into
*NL*
Verrieres
,
and
thought
he
rode
extremely
well
.
But
as
they
were
*NL*
returning
from
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
he
fell
right
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
Rue
du
Bac
,
as
he
suddenly
tried
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
a
cabriolet
,
*NL*
and
was
spattered
all
over
with
mud
.
It
was
lucky
that
he
had
two
*NL*
suits
.
The
marquis
,
wishing
to
favour
him
with
a
few
words
at
dinner
,
*NL*
asked
him
for
news
of
his
excursion
.
Norbert
began
immediately
to
*NL*
answer
him
in
general
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
le
Comte
is
extremely
kind
to
me
,
''
answered
Julien
.
``
I
thank
him
*NL*
for
it
,
and
I
fully
appreciate
it
.
He
was
good
enough
to
have
the
*NL*
quietest
and
prettiest
horse
given
to
me
,
but
after
all
he
could
*NL*
not
tie
me
on
to
it
,
and
owing
to
the
lack
of
that
precaution
,
I
*NL*
had
a
fall
right
in
the
middle
of
that
long
street
near
the
bridge
.
*NL*
Madame
Mathilde
made
a
futile
effort
to
hide
a
burst
of
laughter
,
and
*NL*
subsequently
was
indiscreet
enough
to
ask
for
details
.
Julien
acquitted
*NL*
himself
with
much
simplicity
.
He
had
grace
without
knowing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
prophesy
favourably
about
that
little
priest
,
''
said
the
marquis
to
*NL*
the
academician
.
``
Think
of
a
provincial
being
simple
over
a
matter
like
*NL*
that
.
Such
a
thing
has
never
been
witnessed
before
,
and
will
never
be
*NL*
witnessed
again
;
and
what
is
more
,
he
describes
his
misfortune
before
*NL*
ladies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
put
his
listeners
so
thoroughly
at
their
ease
over
his
*NL*
misfortune
that
at
the
end
of
the
dinner
,
when
the
general
conversation
*NL*
had
gone
off
on
to
another
subject
,
Mademoiselle
Mathilde
asked
her
*NL*
brother
some
questions
over
the
details
of
the
unfortunate
occurrence
.
*NL*
As
she
put
numerous
questions
,
and
as
Julien
met
her
eyes
several
*NL*
times
,
he
ventured
to
answer
himself
,
although
the
questions
had
not
*NL*
been
addressed
to
him
,
and
all
three
of
them
finished
up
by
laughing
*NL*
just
as
though
they
had
all
been
inhabitants
of
some
village
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
a
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
Julien
attended
two
theology
lectures
,
and
then
*NL*
came
back
to
copy
out
about
twenty
letters
.
He
found
a
young
man
,
who
*NL*
though
very
carefully
dressed
,
had
a
mean
appearance
and
an
envious
*NL*
expression
,
established
near
him
in
the
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
entered
,
``
What
are
you
doing
here
,
M.
Tanbeau
?
''
he
said
*NL*
severely
to
the
new-comer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
--
''
answered
the
young
man
,
with
a
base
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
monsieur
,
you
thought
nothing
of
the
kind
.
This
is
a
try-on
,
but
*NL*
it
is
an
unfortunate
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Tanbeau
got
up
in
a
rage
and
disappeared
.
He
was
a
nephew
of
the
*NL*
academician
who
was
a
friend
of
Madame
de
la
Mole
,
and
intended
to
take
*NL*
up
the
profession
of
letters
.
The
academician
had
induced
the
marquis
*NL*
to
take
him
as
a
secretary
.
Tanbeau
used
to
work
in
a
separate
room
,
*NL*
but
having
heard
of
the
favour
that
was
vouchsafed
to
Julien
he
wished
*NL*
to
share
it
,
and
he
had
gone
this
morning
and
established
his
desk
in
*NL*
the
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
four
o'clock
Julien
ventured
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
to
present
*NL*
himself
to
Count
Norbert
.
The
latter
was
on
the
point
of
going
riding
,
*NL*
and
being
a
man
of
perfect
politeness
felt
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
he
said
to
Julien
,
``
that
you
had
better
go
to
the
riding
*NL*
school
,
and
after
a
few
weeks
,
I
shall
be
charmed
to
ride
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
have
the
honour
of
thanking
you
for
the
kindness
*NL*
which
you
have
shewn
me
.
Believe
me
,
monsieur
,
''
added
Julien
very
*NL*
seriously
,
``
that
I
appreciate
all
I
owe
you
.
If
your
horse
has
not
been
*NL*
hurt
by
the
reason
of
my
clumsiness
of
yesterday
,
and
if
it
is
free
I
*NL*
should
like
to
ride
it
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
upon
my
word
,
my
dear
Sorel
,
you
do
so
at
your
own
risk
and
*NL*
peril
;
kindly
assume
that
I
have
put
forth
all
the
objections
required
*NL*
by
prudence
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
four
o'clock
,
we
have
no
time
to
*NL*
lose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Julien
was
on
horseback
,
he
said
to
the
young
count
,
``
What
*NL*
must
one
do
not
to
fall
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lots
of
things
,
''
answered
Norbert
,
bursting
into
laughter
.
``
Keep
your
*NL*
body
back
for
instance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
put
his
horse
to
the
trot
.
They
were
at
the
Place
Louis
XVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
foolhardy
youngster
,
''
said
Norbert
``
there
are
too
many
*NL*
carriages
here
,
and
they
are
driven
by
careless
drivers
into
the
*NL*
bargain
.
Once
you
are
on
the
ground
their
tilburies
will
run
over
your
*NL*
body
,
they
will
not
risk
spoiling
their
horses
'
mouths
by
pulling
up
*NL*
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Norbert
saw
Julien
twenty
times
on
the
point
of
tumbling
,
but
in
the
*NL*
end
the
excursion
finished
without
misadventure
.
As
they
came
back
the
*NL*
young
count
said
to
his
sister
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
introduce
a
dashing
dare-devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
talked
to
his
father
over
the
dinner
from
one
end
of
the
table
*NL*
to
the
other
,
he
did
justice
to
Julien
's
courage
.
It
was
the
only
*NL*
thing
one
could
possibly
praise
about
his
style
of
riding
.
The
young
*NL*
count
had
heard
in
the
morning
the
men
who
groomed
the
horses
in
the
*NL*
courtyard
making
Julien
's
fall
an
opportunity
for
the
most
outrageous
*NL*
jokes
at
his
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
so
much
kindness
Julien
soon
felt
himself
completely
*NL*
isolated
in
this
family
.
All
their
customs
seemed
strange
to
him
,
and
*NL*
he
was
cognizant
of
none
of
them
.
His
blunders
were
the
delight
of
the
*NL*
valets
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
Pirard
had
left
for
his
living
.
``
If
Julien
is
a
weak
reed
,
*NL*
let
him
perish
.
If
he
is
a
man
of
spirit
,
let
him
get
out
of
his
*NL*
difficulties
all
alone

he
thought
.

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
THE
HOTEL
DE
LA
MOLE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
he
doing
here
?
Will
he
like
it
there
?
Will
he
*NL*
try
to
please
?
--
_
Ronsard
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
everything
in
the
aristocratic
salon
of
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
seemed
*NL*
strange
to
Julien
,
that
pale
young
man
in
his
black
suit
seemed
in
his
*NL*
turn
very
strange
to
those
persons
who
deigned
to
notice
him
.
Madame
de
*NL*
la
Mole
suggested
to
her
husband
that
he
should
send
him
off
on
some
*NL*
business
on
those
days
when
they
had
certain
persons
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
carry
the
experiment
to
its
logical
conclusion
,
''
answered
*NL*
the
marquis
.
``
The
abbe
Pirard
contends
that
we
are
wrong
in
crushing
*NL*
the
self-respect
of
the
people
whom
we
allow
around
us
.
_
One
can
only
*NL*
lean
on
what
resists
_
.
The
only
thing
against
this
man
is
his
unknown
*NL*
face
,
apart
from
that
he
is
a
deaf
mute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
am
to
know
my
way
about
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
``
I
must
write
*NL*
down
the
names
of
the
persons
whom
I
see
come
to
the
salon
together
*NL*
with
a
few
words
on
their
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
at
the
head
of
the
list
five
or
six
friends
of
the
house
who
*NL*
took
every
opportunity
of
paying
court
to
him
,
believing
that
he
was
*NL*
protected
by
a
whim
of
the
marquis
.
They
were
poor
dull
devils
.
But
it
*NL*
must
be
said
in
praise
of
this
class
of
men
,
such
as
they
are
found
*NL*
to-day
in
the
salons
of
the
aristocracy
,
that
every
one
did
not
find
*NL*
them
equally
tame
.
One
of
them
was
now
allowing
himself
to
be
bullied
*NL*
by
the
marquis
,
who
was
venting
his
irritation
at
a
harsh
remark
which
*NL*
had
been
addressed
to
him
by
the
marquise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
masters
of
the
house
were
too
proud
or
too
prone
to
boredom
;
they
*NL*
were
too
much
used
to
finding
their
only
distraction
in
the
addressing
*NL*
of
insults
,
to
enable
them
to
expect
true
friends
.
But
,
except
on
*NL*
rainy
days
and
in
rare
moments
of
savage
boredom
,
they
always
showed
*NL*
themselves
perfectly
polite
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
five
or
six
toadies
who
manifested
so
paternal
an
affection
*NL*
towards
Julien
had
deserted
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
,
the
marquise
would
*NL*
have
been
exposed
to
long
spells
of
solitude
,
and
in
the
eyes
of
women
*NL*
of
that
class
,
solitude
is
awful
,
it
is
the
symbol
of
_
disgrace
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
was
charming
to
his
wife
.
He
saw
that
her
salon
was
*NL*
sufficiently
furnished
,
though
not
with
peers
,
for
he
did
not
think
his
*NL*
new
colleagues
were
sufficiently
noble
to
come
to
his
house
as
friends
,
*NL*
or
sufficiently
amusing
to
be
admitted
as
inferiors
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
later
that
Julien
fathomed
these
secrets
.
The
governing
*NL*
policy
of
a
household
,
though
it
forms
the
staple
of
conversation
in
*NL*
bourgeois
families
,
is
only
alluded
to
in
families
of
the
class
of
that
*NL*
of
the
marquis
in
moments
of
distress
.
So
paramount
even
in
this
bored
*NL*
century
is
the
necessity
of
amusing
one
's
self
,
that
even
on
the
days
*NL*
of
dinner-parties
the
marquis
had
scarcely
left
the
salon
before
all
*NL*
the
guests
ran
away
.
Provided
that
one
did
not
make
any
jests
about
*NL*
either
God
or
the
priests
or
the
king
or
the
persons
in
office
,
or
the
*NL*
artists
who
enjoyed
the
favour
of
the
court
,
or
of
anything
that
was
*NL*
established
,
provided
that
one
did
not
praise
either
Beranger
or
the
*NL*
opposition
papers
,
or
Voltaire
or
Rousseau
or
anything
which
involved
*NL*
any
element
of
free
speech
,
provided
that
above
all
that
one
never
*NL*
talked
politics
,
one
could
discuss
everything
with
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
income
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
a
year
and
no
blue
*NL*
ribbon
which
could
sustain
a
contest
against
such
a
code
of
salon
*NL*
etiquette
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slightest
live
idea
appeared
a
crudity
.
In
spite
of
the
prevailing
*NL*
good
form
,
perfect
politeness
,
and
desire
to
please
,
_
ennui
_
was
*NL*
visible
in
every
face
.
The
young
people
who
came
to
pay
their
calls
*NL*
were
frightened
of
speaking
of
anything
which
might
make
them
suspected
*NL*
of
thinking
or
of
betraying
that
they
had
read
something
prohibited
,
*NL*
and
relapsed
into
silence
after
a
few
elegant
phrases
about
Rossini
and
*NL*
the
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
noticed
that
the
conversation
was
usually
kept
alive
by
two
*NL*
viscounts
and
five
barons
whom
M.
de
la
Mole
had
known
at
the
time
of
*NL*
the
emigration
.
These
gentlemen
enjoyed
an
income
of
from
six
to
eight
*NL*
hundred
thousand
francs
.
Four
swore
by
the
_
Quotidienne
_
and
three
*NL*
by
the
_
Gazette
de
France
_
.
One
of
them
had
every
day
some
anecdote
*NL*
to
tell
about
the
Chateau
,
in
which
he
made
lavish
use
of
the
word
*NL*
_
admirable
_
.
Julien
noticed
that
he
had
five
crosses
,
the
others
as
a
*NL*
rule
only
had
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
way
of
compensation
six
footmen
in
livery
were
to
be
seen
in
the
*NL*
ante-room
,
and
during
the
whole
evening
ices
or
tea
were
served
every
*NL*
quarter-of-an-hour
,
while
about
midnight
there
was
a
kind
of
supper
*NL*
with
champagne
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
reason
that
sometimes
induced
Julien
to
stay
till
the
*NL*
end
.
Apart
from
this
he
could
scarcely
understand
why
any
one
could
*NL*
bring
himself
to
take
seriously
the
ordinary
conversation
in
this
*NL*
magnificently
gilded
salon
.
Sometimes
he
would
look
at
the
talkers
to
*NL*
see
if
they
themselves
were
not
making
fun
of
what
they
were
saying
.
*NL*
``
My
M.
de
Maistre
,
whom
I
know
by
heart
,
''
he
thought
,
``
has
put
it
a
*NL*
hundred
times
better
,
and
all
the
same
he
is
pretty
boring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
not
the
only
one
to
appreciate
this
stifling
moral
*NL*
atmosphere
.
Some
consoled
themselves
by
taking
a
great
quantity
of
*NL*
ices
,
others
by
the
pleasure
of
saying
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
``
I
*NL*
have
just
come
from
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
where
I
learnt
that
Russia
,
*NL*
etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
learnt
from
one
of
the
toadies
that
scarcely
six
months
ago
*NL*
madame
de
la
Mole
had
rewarded
more
than
twenty
years
of
assiduous
*NL*
attention
by
promoting
the
poor
baron
Le
Bourguignon
,
who
had
been
a
*NL*
sub-prefect
since
the
restoration
,
to
the
rank
of
prefect
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
great
event
had
whetted
the
zeal
of
all
these
gentlemen
.
*NL*
Previously
there
were
few
things
to
which
they
would
have
objected
,
*NL*
now
they
objected
to
nothing
.
There
was
rarely
any
overt
lack
of
*NL*
consideration
,
but
Julien
had
already
caught
at
meals
two
or
three
*NL*
little
short
dialogues
between
the
marquis
and
his
wife
which
were
*NL*
cruel
to
those
who
were
seated
near
them
.
These
noble
personages
did
*NL*
not
conceal
their
sincere
contempt
for
everyone
who
was
not
sprung
*NL*
from
people
who
were
entitled
to
ride
in
the
carriages
of
the
king
.
*NL*
Julien
noticed
that
the
word
crusade
was
the
only
word
which
gave
their
*NL*
face
an
expression
of
deep
seriousness
akin
to
respect
.
Their
ordinary
*NL*
respect
had
always
a
touch
of
condescension
.
In
the
middle
of
this
*NL*
magnificence
and
this
boredom
Julien
was
interested
in
nothing
except
*NL*
M.
de
la
Mole
.
He
was
delighted
to
hear
him
protest
one
day
that
he
*NL*
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
promotion
of
that
poor
Le
Bourguignon
,
*NL*
it
was
an
attention
to
the
marquise
.
Julien
knew
the
truth
from
the
*NL*
abbe
Pirard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
was
working
in
the
marquis
's
library
with
Julien
one
morning
*NL*
at
the
eternal
de
Frilair
lawsuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
Julien
suddenly
,
``
is
dining
every
day
with
madame
la
*NL*
marquise
one
of
my
duties
or
a
special
favour
that
they
show
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
special
honour
,
''
replied
the
scandalised
abbe
.
``
M.
the
*NL*
Academician
,
who
has
been
cultivating
the
family
for
fifteen
years
,
has
*NL*
never
been
able
to
obtain
so
much
for
his
M.
Tanbeau
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
find
it
,
sir
,
the
most
painful
part
of
my
employment
.
I
was
less
*NL*
bored
at
the
seminary
.
Some
times
I
see
even
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
*NL*
yawn
,
and
yet
she
ought
to
be
accustomed
to
the
social
charms
of
the
*NL*
friends
of
the
house
.
I
am
frightened
of
falling
asleep
.
As
a
favour
,
*NL*
obtain
permission
for
me
to
go
and
get
a
forty
sous
'
dinner
in
some
*NL*
obscure
inn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
who
was
a
true
snob
,
was
very
appreciative
of
the
honour
of
*NL*
dining
with
a
great
lord
.
While
he
was
endeavouring
to
get
Julien
to
*NL*
understand
this
point
of
view
a
slight
noise
made
them
turn
round
.
*NL*
Julien
saw
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
listening
.
He
reddened
.
She
had
come
*NL*
to
fetch
a
book
and
had
heard
everything
.
She
began
to
entertain
some
*NL*
respect
for
Julien
.
``
He
has
not
been
born
servile
,
''
she
thought
,
``
like
*NL*
that
old
abbe
.
Heavens
,
how
ugly
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
Julien
did
not
venture
to
look
at
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
*NL*
but
she
was
kind
enough
to
speak
to
him
.
They
were
expecting
a
lot
*NL*
of
visitors
that
day
and
she
asked
him
to
stay
.
The
young
girls
of
*NL*
Paris
are
not
at
all
fond
of
persons
of
a
certain
age
,
especially
when
*NL*
they
are
slovenly
.
Julien
did
not
need
much
penetration
to
realise
*NL*
that
the
colleagues
of
M.
le
Bourguignon
who
remained
in
the
salon
*NL*
had
the
privilege
of
being
the
ordinary
butt
of
mademoiselle
de
la
*NL*
Mole
's
jokes
.
On
this
particular
day
,
whether
or
not
by
reason
of
some
*NL*
affectation
on
her
part
,
she
proved
cruel
to
bores
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
was
the
centre
of
a
little
knot
which
used
to
*NL*
form
nearly
every
evening
behind
the
marquise
's
immense
arm-chair
.
*NL*
There
were
to
be
found
there
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
,
the
comte
*NL*
de
Caylus
,
the
vicomte
de
Luz
and
two
or
three
other
young
officers
,
*NL*
the
friends
of
Norbert
or
his
sister
.
These
gentlemen
used
to
sit
*NL*
down
on
a
large
blue
sofa
.
At
the
end
of
the
sofa
,
opposite
the
part
*NL*
where
the
brilliant
Mathilde
was
sitting
,
Julien
sat
in
silence
on
a
*NL*
little
,
rather
low
straw
chair
.
This
modest
position
was
envied
by
all
*NL*
the
toadies
;
Norbert
kept
his
father
's
young
secretary
in
countenance
*NL*
by
speaking
to
him
,
or
mentioning
him
by
name
once
or
twice
in
the
*NL*
evening
.
On
this
particular
occasion
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
asked
him
*NL*
what
was
the
height
of
the
mountain
on
which
the
citadel
of
Besancon
*NL*
is
planted
.
Julien
had
never
any
idea
if
this
mountain
was
higher
or
*NL*
lower
than
Montmartre
.
He
often
laughed
heartily
at
what
was
said
in
*NL*
this
little
knot
,
but
he
felt
himself
incapable
of
inventing
anything
*NL*
analagous
.
It
was
like
a
strange
language
which
he
understood
but
could
*NL*
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
particular
day
Matilde
's
friends
manifested
a
continuous
*NL*
hostility
to
the
visitors
who
came
into
the
vast
salon
.
The
friends
of
*NL*
the
house
were
the
favoured
victims
at
first
,
inasmuch
as
they
were
*NL*
better
known
.
You
can
form
your
opinion
as
to
whether
Julien
paid
*NL*
attention
;
everything
interested
him
,
both
the
substance
of
things
and
*NL*
the
manner
of
making
fun
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
is
M.
Descoulis
,
''
said
Matilde
;
``
he
does
n't
wear
a
wig
any
*NL*
more
.
Does
he
want
to
get
a
prefectship
through
sheer
force
of
genius
?
*NL*
He
is
displaying
that
bald
forehead
which
he
says
is
filled
with
lofty
*NL*
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
man
who
knows
the
whole
world
,
''
said
the
marquis
de
*NL*
Croisenois
.
``
He
also
goes
to
my
uncle
the
cardinal
's
.
He
is
capable
of
*NL*
cultivating
a
falsehood
with
each
of
his
friends
for
years
on
end
,
and
*NL*
he
has
two
or
three
hundred
friends
.
He
knows
how
to
nurse
friendship
,
*NL*
that
is
his
talent
.
He
will
go
out
,
just
as
you
see
him
,
in
the
worst
*NL*
winter
weather
,
and
be
at
the
door
of
one
of
his
friends
by
seven
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
quarrels
from
time
to
time
and
he
writes
seven
or
eight
letters
*NL*
for
each
quarrel
.
Then
he
has
a
reconciliation
and
he
writes
seven
or
*NL*
eight
letters
to
express
his
bursts
of
friendship
.
But
he
shines
most
*NL*
brilliantly
in
the
frank
and
sincere
expansiveness
of
the
honest
man
*NL*
who
keeps
nothing
up
his
sleeve
.
This
manoeuvre
is
brought
into
play
*NL*
when
he
has
some
favour
to
ask
.
One
of
my
uncle
's
grand
vicars
is
very
*NL*
good
at
telling
the
life
of
M.
Descoulis
since
the
restoration
.
I
will
*NL*
bring
him
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
I
do
n't
believe
all
that
,
it
's
professional
jealousy
among
the
*NL*
lower
classes

said
the
comte
de
Caylus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Descoulis
will
live
in
history
,
''
replied
the
marquis
.
``
He
brought
*NL*
about
the
restoration
together
with
the
abbe
de
Pradt
and
messieurs
de

Talleyrand

di
Borgo

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man

handled

Norbert
,
``

frequently
atrocious
.
`
How
many
times
have
you
betrayed
your
friends

Descoulis

he
shouted
at
him
one
day
from
one
end
of
the
table
*NL*
to
the
other
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

asked
mademoiselle

la
Mole

``
Who
has
not
played
the
traitor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

said
the
comte
de
Caylus
to
Norbert
,
``

celebrated
Liberal

go
up

He
is
said
to
be
so
clever

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
will

M.

extravagant

mademoiselle

bows
down
to

ground

M.

his

I
almost
thought

*NL*
*NL*
``
Descoulis
must
stand
better

answered
M.

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
there
's
a
really
witty
man
,
M.
the
Baron
Baton

said
mademoiselle
*NL*
de
la
Mole
,
imitating
a
little
the
voice
of
the
flunkey
who
had
just
*NL*
announced
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
even
your
servants
make
fun

a

Baton

said
M.
de
Caylus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

he
said
to
us
the
other
day

went
on
Matilde

*NL*
``
Imagine

used

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Julien
left
the
vicinity
of
the
sofa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
insufficiently
appreciative
of
the
charming
subtleties
of
a
*NL*
delicate
raillery
to
laugh
at
a
joke
,
he
considered
that
a
jest
ought
*NL*
to
have
some
logical
foundation
.
He
saw
nothing
in
these
young
peoples
'
*NL*
conversation
except
a
vein
of
universal
scandal-mongering
and
was
*NL*
shocked
by
it
.
His
provincial
or
English
prudery
went
so
far
as
to
*NL*
detect
envy
in
it
,
though
in
this
he
was
certainly
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Norbert
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
who
has
had
to
make
three
drafts
*NL*
for
a
twenty-line
letter

would
be
only

glad
to
have
*NL*
written
once
in
his
whole
life
one
page
as
good
as
M.
Sainclair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
approached
successively
the
several
groups
and
attracted
no
*NL*
attention
by
reason
of
his
lack
of
importance
.
He
followed
the
Baron
*NL*
Baton
from
a
distance
and
tried
to
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
witty
man
appeared
nervous
and
Julien
did
not
see
him
recover
*NL*
his
equanimity
before
he
had
hit
upon
three
or
four
stinging
phrases
.
*NL*
Julien
thought
that
this
kind
of
wit
had
great
need
of
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Baron
could
not
make
epigrams
.
He
needed
at
least
four
sentences
of
*NL*
six
lines
each
,
in
order
to
be
brilliant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
argues
,
he
does
not
talk
,
''
said
someone
behind
Julien
.
He
*NL*
turned
round
and
reddened
with
pleasure
when
he
heard
the
name
of
the
*NL*
comte
Chalvet
.
He
was
the
subtlest
man
of
the
century
.
Julien
had
often
*NL*
found
his
name
in
the
_
Memorial
of
St.
Helena
_
and
in
the
portions
of
*NL*
history
dictated
by
Napoleon
.
The
diction
of
comte
Chalvet
was
laconic
,
*NL*
his
phrases
were
flashes
of
lightning
--
just
,
vivid
,
deep
.
If
he
talked
*NL*
about
any
matter
the
conversation
immediately
made
a
step
forward
;
he
*NL*
imported
facts
into
it
;
it
was
a
pleasure
to
hear
him
.
In
politics
,
*NL*
however
,
he
was
a
brazen
cynic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
independent
,
I
am
,
''
he
was
saying
to
a
gentleman
with
three
*NL*
stars
,
of
whom
apparently
he
was
making
fun
.
``
Why
insist
on
my
having
*NL*
to-day
the
same
opinion
I
had
six
weeks
ago
.
In
that
case
my
opinion
*NL*
would
be
my
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Four
grave
young
men
who
were
standing
round
scowled
;
these
gentlemen
*NL*
did
not
like
flippancy
.
The
comte
saw
that
he
had
gone
too
far
.
Luckily
*NL*
he
perceived
the
honest
M.
Balland
,
a
veritable
hypocrite
of
honesty
.
*NL*
The
count
began
to
talk
to
him
;
people
closed
up
,
for
they
realised
*NL*
that
poor
Balland
was
going
to
be
the
next
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Balland
,
although
he
was
horribly
ugly
and
his
first
steps
in
the
*NL*
world
were
almost
unmentionable
,
had
by
dint
of
his
morals
and
his
*NL*
morality
married
a
very
rich
wife
who
had
died
;
he
subsequently
married
*NL*
a
second
very
rich
one
who
was
never
seen
in
society
.
He
enjoyed
,
in
*NL*
all
humility
,
an
income
of
sixty
thousand
francs
,
and
had
his
own
*NL*
flatterers
.
Comte
Chalvet
talked
to
him
pitilessly
about
all
this
.
*NL*
There
was
soon
a
circle
of
thirty
persons
around
them
.
Everybody
was
*NL*
smiling
,
including
the
solemn
young
men
who
were
the
hope
of
the
*NL*
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
he
come
to
M.
de
la
Mole
where
he
is
obviously
only
a
*NL*
laughing
stock
?
''
thought
Julien
.
He
approached
the
abbe
Pirard
to
ask
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Balland
made
his
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
Norbert
,
``
there
is
one
of
the
spies
of
my
father
gone

*NL*
there
is
only
the
little
limping
Napier
left
.

``
Can
that
be
the
key
of
the
riddle
?
''
thought
Julien
,
``
but
if
so
,
why
*NL*
does
the
marquis
receive
M.
Balland
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stern
abbe
Pirard
was
scowling
in
a
corner
of
the
salon
listening
*NL*
to
the
lackeys
announcing
the
names
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
nothing
more
than
a
den
,
''
he
was
saying
like
another
Basil
,
``
I
*NL*
see
none
but
shady
people
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
the
severe
abbe
did
not
know
what
constitutes
*NL*
high
society
.
But
his
friends
the
Jansenites
,
had
given
him
some
very
*NL*
precise
notions
about
those
men
who
only
get
into
society
by
reason
*NL*
of
their
extreme
subtlety
in
the
service
of
all
parties
,
or
of
their
*NL*
monstrous
wealth
.
For
some
minutes
that
evening
he
answered
Julien
's
*NL*
eager
questions
fully
and
freely
,
and
then
suddenly
stopped
short
*NL*
grieved
at
having
always
to
say
ill
of
every
one
,
and
thinking
he
was
*NL*
guilty
of
a
sin
.
Bilious
Jansenist
as
he
was
,
and
believing
as
he
did
*NL*
in
the
duty
of
Christian
charity
,
his
life
was
a
perpetual
conflict
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
that
abbe
Pirard
looks
,
''
said
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
as
*NL*
Julien
came
near
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
felt
irritated
,
but
she
was
right
all
the
same
.
M.
Pirard
was
*NL*
unquestionably
the
most
honest
man
in
the
salon
,
but
his
pimply
face
,
*NL*
which
was
suffering
from
the
stings
of
conscience
,
made
him
look
*NL*
hideous
at
this
particular
moment
.
``
Trust
physiognomy
after
this
,
''
*NL*
thought
Julien
,
``
it
is
only
when
the
delicate
conscience
of
the
abbe
*NL*
Pirard
is
reproaching
him
for
some
trifling
lapse
that
he
looks
so
*NL*
awful
;
while
the
expression
of
that
notorious
spy
Napier
shows
a
pure
*NL*
and
tranquil
happiness
.
''
The
abbe
Pirard
,
however
,
had
made
great
*NL*
concessions
to
his
party
.
He
had
taken
a
servant
,
and
was
very
well
*NL*
dressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
noticed
something
strange
in
the
salon
,
it
was
that
all
eyes
*NL*
were
being
turned
towards
the
door
,
and
there
was
a
semi
silence
.
The
*NL*
flunkey
was
announcing
the
famous
Barron
Tolly
,
who
had
just
become
*NL*
publicly
conspicuous
by
reason
of
the
elections
.
Julien
came
forward
*NL*
and
had
a
very
good
view
of
him
.
The
baron
had
been
the
president
of
*NL*
an
electoral
college
;
he
had
the
brilliant
idea
of
spiriting
away
*NL*
the
little
squares
of
paper
which
contained
the
votes
of
one
of
the
*NL*
parties
.
But
to
make
up
for
it
he
replaced
them
by
an
equal
number
of
*NL*
other
little
pieces
of
paper
containing
a
name
agreeable
to
himself
.
*NL*
This
drastic
manoeuvre
had
been
noticed
by
some
of
the
voters
,
who
had
*NL*
made
an
immediate
point
of
congratulating
the
Baron
de
Tolly
.
The
good
*NL*
fellow
was
still
pale
from
this
great
business
.
Malicious
persons
had
*NL*
pronounced
the
word
galleys
.
M.
de
la
Mole
received
him
coldly
.
The
*NL*
poor
Baron
made
his
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
leaves
us
so
quickly
it
's
to
go
to
M.
Comte
's
,
''
-LSB-
1
-RSB-
said
Comte
*NL*
Chalvet
and
everyone
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Tanbeau
was
trying
to
win
his
spurs
by
talking
to
some
silent
*NL*
noblemen
and
some
intriguers
who
,
though
shady
,
were
all
men
of
wit
,
*NL*
and
were
on
this
particular
night
in
great
force
in
M.
de
la
Mole
's
*NL*
salon
-LRB-
for
he
was
mentioned
for
a
place
in
the
ministry
-RRB-
.
If
he
had
not
*NL*
yet
any
subtlety
of
perception
he
made
up
for
it
as
one
will
see
by
the
*NL*
energy
of
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
sentence
that
man
to
ten
years
'
imprisonment
,
''
he
was
saying
*NL*
at
the
moment
when
Julien
approached
his
knot
.
``
Those
reptiles
should
*NL*
be
confined
in
the
bottom
of
a
dungeon
,
they
ought
to
languish
to
death
*NL*
in
gaol
,
otherwise
their
venom
will
grow
and
become
more
dangerous
.
*NL*
What
is
the
good
of
sentencing
him
to
a
fine
of
a
thousand
crowns
?
He
*NL*
is
poor
,
so
be
it
,
all
the
better
,
but
his
party
will
pay
for
him
.
What
*NL*
the
case
required
was
a
five
hundred
francs
fine
and
ten
years
in
a
*NL*
dungeon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
to
be
sure
,
who
is
the
monster
they
are
speaking
about
?
''
thought
*NL*
Julien
who
was
viewing
with
amazement
the
vehement
tone
and
hysterical
*NL*
gestures
of
his
colleague
.
At
this
moment
the
thin
,
drawn
,
little
face
*NL*
of
the
academician
's
nephew
was
hideous
.
Julien
soon
learnt
that
they
*NL*
were
talking
of
the
greatest
poet
of
the
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
monster
,
''
Julien
exclaimed
half
aloud
,
while
tears
of
generosity
*NL*
moistened
his
eyes
.
``
You
little
rascal
,
''
he
thought
,
``
I
will
pay
you
*NL*
out
for
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
''
he
thought
,
``
those
are
the
unborn
hopes
of
the
party
of
which
*NL*
the
marquis
is
one
of
the
chiefs
.
How
many
crosses
and
how
many
*NL*
sinecures
would
that
celebrated
man
whom
he
is
now
defaming
have
*NL*
accumulated
if
he
had
sold
himself
--
I
wo
n't
say
to
the
mediocre
*NL*
ministry
of
M.
de
Nerval
--
but
to
one
of
those
reasonably
honest
*NL*
ministries
which
we
have
seen
follow
each
other
in
succession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
Pirard
motioned
to
Julien
from
some
distance
off
;
M.
de
la
*NL*
Mole
had
just
said
something
to
him
.
But
when
Julien
,
who
was
listening
*NL*
at
the
moment
with
downcast
eyes
to
the
lamentations
of
the
bishop
,
*NL*
had
at
length
got
free
and
was
able
to
get
near
his
friend
,
he
found
*NL*
him
monopolised
by
the
abominable
little
Tanbeau
.
The
little
beast
*NL*
hated
him
as
the
cause
of
Julien
's
favour
with
the
marquis
,
and
was
now
*NL*
making
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
When
will
death
deliver
us
from
that
aged
rottenness
_
,
''
it
was
in
*NL*
these
words
of
a
biblical
energy
that
the
little
man
of
letters
was
*NL*
now
talking
of
the
venerable
Lord
Holland
.
His
merit
consisted
in
an
*NL*
excellent
knowledge
of
the
biography
of
living
men
,
and
he
had
just
*NL*
made
a
rapid
review
of
all
the
men
who
could
aspire
to
some
influence
*NL*
under
the
reign
of
the
new
King
of
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbe
Pirard
passed
in
to
an
adjacent
salon
.
Julien
followed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
warn
you
the
marquis
does
not
like
scribblers
,
it
is
his
only
*NL*
prejudice
.
Know
Latin
and
Greek
if
you
can
manage
it
,
the
history
of
*NL*
the
Egyptians
,
Persians
,
etc.
,
he
will
honour
and
protect
you
as
a
*NL*
learned
man
.
But
do
n't
write
a
page
of
French
,
especially
on
serious
*NL*
matters
which
are
above
your
position
in
society
,
or
he
will
call
you
*NL*
a
scribbler
and
take
you
for
a
scoundrel
.
How
is
it
that
living
as
you
*NL*
do
in
the
hotel
of
a
great
lord
you
do
n't
know
the
Duke
de
Castries
'
*NL*
epigram
on
Alembert
and
Rousseau
:
`
the
fellow
wants
to
reason
about
*NL*
everything
and
has
n't
got
an
income
of
a
thousand
crowns
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
leaks
out
here
,
''
thought
Julien
,
``
just
like
the
seminary
.
''
*NL*
He
had
written
eight
or
six
fairly
drastic
pages
.
It
was
a
kind
of
*NL*
historical
eulogy
of
the
old
surgeon-major
who
had
,
he
said
,
made
a
man
*NL*
of
him
.
``
The
little
note
book
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
,
``
has
always
*NL*
been
locked
.
''
He
went
up
to
his
room
,
burnt
his
manuscript
and
returned
*NL*
to
the
salon
.
The
brilliant
scoundrels
had
left
it
,
only
the
men
with
*NL*
the
stars
were
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
or
eight
very
aristocratic
ladies
,
very
devout
,
very
affected
,
*NL*
and
of
from
thirty
to
thirty-five
years
of
age
,
were
grouped
round
*NL*
the
table
that
the
servants
had
just
brought
in
ready
served
.
The
*NL*
brilliant
marechale
de
Fervaques
came
in
apologising
for
the
lateness
*NL*
of
the
hour
.
It
was
more
than
midnight
:
she
went
and
sat
down
near
*NL*
the
marquise
.
Julien
was
deeply
touched
,
she
had
the
eyes
and
the
*NL*
expression
of
madame
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
circle
was
still
full
of
people
.
She
was
*NL*
engaged
with
her
friends
in
making
fun
of
the
unfortunate
comte
de
*NL*
Thaler
.
He
was
the
only
son
of
that
celebrated
Jew
who
was
famous
for
*NL*
the
riches
that
he
had
won
by
lending
money
to
kings
to
make
war
on
the
*NL*
peoples
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jew
had
just
died
leaving
his
son
an
income
of
one
hundred
thousand
*NL*
crowns
a
month
,
and
a
name
that
was
only
too
well
known
.
This
strange
*NL*
position
required
either
a
simple
character
or
force
of
will
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
the
comte
was
simply
a
fellow
who
was
inflated
by
all
*NL*
kinds
of
pretensions
which
had
been
suggested
to
him
by
all
his
toadies
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Caylus
asserted
that
they
had
induced
him
to
make
up
his
mind
to
*NL*
ask
for
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
to
whom
the
marquis
de
*NL*
Croisenois
,
who
would
be
a
duke
with
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
,
*NL*
was
paying
his
attentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
not
accuse
him
of
having
a
mind
,
''
said
Norbert
pitifully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will-power
was
what
the
poor
comte
de
Thaler
lacked
most
of
all
.
So
*NL*
far
as
this
side
of
his
character
went
he
was
worthy
of
being
a
king
.
*NL*
He
would
take
council
from
everybody
,
but
he
never
had
the
courage
to
*NL*
follow
any
advice
to
the
bitter
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
physiognomy
would
be
sufficient
in
itself
,
''
mademoiselle
de
la
*NL*
Mole
was
fond
of
saying
,
``
to
have
inspired
her
with
a
holy
joy
.
''
It
*NL*
was
a
singular
mixture
of
anxiety
and
disappointment
,
but
from
time
to
*NL*
time
one
could
distinguish
gusts
of
self-importance
,
and
above
all
that
*NL*
trenchant
tone
suited
to
the
richest
man
in
France
,
especially
when
he
*NL*
had
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
his
personal
appearance
and
was
not
yet
*NL*
thirty-six
.
``
He
is
timidly
insolent
,
''
M.
de
Croisenois
would
say
.
The
*NL*
comte
de
Caylus
,
Norbert
,
and
two
or
three
moustachioed
young
people
*NL*
made
fun
of
him
to
their
heart
's
content
without
him
suspecting
it
,
and
*NL*
finally
packed
him
off
as
one
o'clock
struck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
those
your
famous
Arab
horses
waiting
for
you
at
the
door
in
this
*NL*
awful
weather
?
''
said
Norbert
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
a
new
pair
which
are
much
cheaper
,
''
said
M.
de
Thaler
.
``
The
*NL*
horse
on
the
left
cost
me
five
thousand
francs
,
while
the
one
on
the
*NL*
right
is
only
worth
one
hundred
louis
,
but
I
would
ask
you
to
believe
*NL*
me
when
I
say
that
I
only
have
him
out
at
night
.
His
trot
you
see
is
*NL*
exactly
like
the
other
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Norbert
's
remark
made
the
comte
think
it
was
good
form
for
a
man
like
*NL*
him
to
make
a
hobby
of
his
horses
,
and
that
he
must
not
let
them
get
*NL*
wet
.
He
went
away
,
and
the
other
gentleman
left
a
minute
afterwards
*NL*
making
fun
of
him
all
the
time
.
``
So
,
''
thought
Julien
as
he
heard
them
*NL*
laugh
on
the
staircase
,
``
I
have
the
privilege
of
seeing
the
exact
*NL*
opposite
of
my
own
situation
.
I
have
not
got
twenty
louis
a
year
and
I
*NL*
found
myself
side
by
side
with
a
man
who
has
twenty
louis
an
hour
and
*NL*
they
made
fun
of
him
.
Seeing
a
sight
like
that
cures
one
of
envy

CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
SENSIBILITY
AND
A
GREAT
PIOUS
LADY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
An
idea
which
has
any
life
in
it
seems
like
a
crudity
,
*NL*
so
accustomed
are
they
to
colourless
expression
.
Woe
to
*NL*
him
who
introduces
new
ideas
into
his
conversation
!
*NL*
--
_
Faublas
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
stage
Julien
had
reached
,
when
after
several
months
of
*NL*
probation
the
steward
of
the
household
handed
him
the
third
quarter
of
*NL*
his
wages
.
M.
de
la
Mole
had
entrusted
him
with
the
administration
of
*NL*
his
estates
in
Brittany
and
Normandy
.
Julien
made
frequent
journeys
*NL*
there
.
He
had
chief
control
of
the
correspondence
relating
to
the
*NL*
famous
lawsuit
with
the
abbe
de
Frilair
.
M.
Pirard
had
instructed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
data
of
the
short
notes
which
the
marquis
would
scribble
on
the
*NL*
margin
of
all
the
various
paper
which
were
addressed
to
him
,
Julien
*NL*
would
compose
answers
which
were
nearly
all
signed
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Theology
School
his
professors
complained
of
his
lack
of
*NL*
industry
,
but
they
did
not
fail
to
regard
him
as
one
of
their
most
*NL*
distinguished
pupils
.
This
varied
work
,
tackled
as
it
was
with
all
*NL*
the
ardour
of
suffering
ambition
,
soon
robbed
Julien
of
that
fresh
*NL*
complexion
which
he
had
brought
from
the
provinces
.
His
pallor
*NL*
constituted
one
of
his
merits
in
the
eyes
of
his
comrades
,
the
young
*NL*
seminarist
;
he
found
them
much
less
malicious
,
much
less
ready
to
bow
*NL*
down
to
a
silver
crown
than
those
of
Besancon
;
they
thought
he
was
*NL*
consumptive
.
The
marquis
had
given
him
a
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
fearing
that
he
might
meet
people
during
his
rides
on
horseback
,
*NL*
had
given
out
that
this
exercise
had
been
prescribed
by
the
doctors
.
*NL*
The
abbe
Pirard
had
taken
him
into
several
Jansenist
Societies
.
Julien
*NL*
was
astonished
;
the
idea
of
religion
was
indissolubly
connected
in
his
*NL*
mind
with
the
ideas
of
hypocrisy
and
covetousness
.
He
admired
those
*NL*
austere
pious
men
who
never
gave
a
thought
to
their
income
.
Several
*NL*
Jansenists
became
friendly
with
him
and
would
give
him
advice
.
A
new
*NL*
world
opened
before
him
.
At
the
Jansenists
he
got
to
know
a
comte
*NL*
Altamira
,
who
was
nearly
six
feet
high
,
was
a
Liberal
,
a
believer
,
and
*NL*
had
been
condemned
to
death
in
his
own
country
.
He
was
struck
by
the
*NL*
strange
contrast
of
devoutness
and
love
of
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
relations
with
the
young
comte
had
become
cool
.
Norbert
*NL*
had
thought
that
he
answered
the
jokes
of
his
friends
with
too
much
*NL*
sharpness
.
Julien
had
committed
one
or
two
breaches
of
social
etiquette
*NL*
and
vowed
to
himself
that
he
would
never
speak
to
mademoiselle
*NL*
Mathilde
.
They
were
always
perfectly
polite
to
him
in
the
Hotel
de
*NL*
la
Mole
but
he
felt
himself
quite
lost
.
His
provincial
common
sense
*NL*
explained
this
result
by
the
vulgar
proverb
_
Tout
beau
tout
nouveau
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gradually
came
to
have
a
little
more
penetration
than
during
his
*NL*
first
days
,
or
it
may
have
been
that
the
first
glamour
of
Parisian
*NL*
urbanity
had
passed
off
.
As
soon
as
he
left
off
working
,
he
fell
a
prey
*NL*
to
a
mortal
boredom
.
He
was
experiencing
the
withering
effects
of
that
*NL*
admirable
politeness
so
typical
of
good
society
,
which
is
so
perfectly
*NL*
modulated
to
every
degree
of
the
social
hierarchy
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
the
provinces
can
be
reproached
with
a
commonness
and
lack
of
*NL*
polish
in
their
tone
;
but
they
show
a
certain
amount
of
passion
,
when
*NL*
they
answer
you
.
Julien
's
self-respect
was
never
wounded
at
the
Hotel
*NL*
de
la
Mole
,
but
he
often
felt
at
the
end
of
the
day
as
though
he
would
*NL*
like
to
cry
.
A
cafe-waiter
in
the
provinces
will
take
an
interest
in
*NL*
you
if
you
happen
to
have
some
accident
as
you
enter
his
cafe
,
but
if
*NL*
this
accident
has
everything
about
it
which
is
disagreeable
to
your
*NL*
vanity
,
he
will
repeat
ten
times
in
succession
the
very
word
which
*NL*
tortures
you
,
as
he
tells
you
how
sorry
he
is
.
At
Paris
they
make
a
*NL*
point
of
laughing
in
secret
,
but
you
always
remain
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
pass
in
silence
over
a
number
of
little
episodes
which
would
have
*NL*
made
Julien
ridiculous
,
if
he
had
not
been
to
some
extent
above
*NL*
ridicule
.
A
foolish
sensibility
resulted
in
his
committing
innumerable
*NL*
acts
of
bad
taste
.
All
his
pleasures
were
precautions
;
he
practiced
*NL*
pistol
shooting
every
day
,
he
was
one
of
the
promising
pupils
of
the
*NL*
most
famous
maitres
d'armes
.
As
soon
as
he
had
an
instant
to
himself
,
*NL*
instead
of
employing
it
in
reading
as
he
did
before
,
he
would
rush
*NL*
off
to
the
riding
school
and
ask
for
the
most
vicious
horses
.
When
he
*NL*
went
out
with
the
master
of
the
riding
school
he
was
almost
invariably
*NL*
thrown
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
found
him
convenient
by
reason
of
his
persistent
industry
,
*NL*
his
silence
and
his
intelligence
,
and
gradually
took
him
into
his
*NL*
confidence
with
regard
to
all
his
affairs
,
which
were
in
any
way
*NL*
difficult
to
unravel
.
The
marquis
was
a
sagacious
business
man
on
all
*NL*
those
occasions
when
his
lofty
ambition
gave
him
some
respite
;
having
*NL*
special
information
within
his
reach
,
he
would
speculate
successfully
*NL*
on
the
Exchange
.
He
would
buy
mansions
and
forests
;
but
he
would
easily
*NL*
lose
his
temper
.
He
would
give
away
hundreds
of
louis
,
and
would
go
*NL*
to
law
for
a
few
hundred
francs
.
Rich
men
with
a
lofty
spirit
have
*NL*
recourse
to
business
not
so
much
for
results
as
for
distraction
.
The
*NL*
marquis
needed
a
chief
of
staff
who
would
put
all
his
money
affairs
*NL*
into
clear
and
lucid
order
.
Madame
de
la
Mole
,
although
of
so
even
a
*NL*
character
,
sometimes
made
fun
of
Julien
.
Great
ladies
have
a
horror
*NL*
of
those
unexpected
incidents
which
are
produced
by
a
sensitive
*NL*
character
;
they
constitute
the
opposite
pole
of
etiquette
.
On
two
or
*NL*
three
occasions
the
marquis
took
his
part
.
``
If
he
is
ridiculous
in
your
*NL*
salon
,
he
triumphs
in
his
office
.
''
Julien
on
his
side
thought
he
had
*NL*
caught
the
marquise
's
secret
.
She
deigned
to
manifest
an
interest
in
*NL*
everything
the
minute
the
Baron
de
la
Joumate
was
announced
.
He
was
a
*NL*
cold
individual
with
an
expressionless
physiognomy
.
He
was
tall
,
thin
,
*NL*
ugly
,
very
well
dressed
,
passed
his
life
in
his
chateau
,
and
generally
*NL*
speaking
said
nothing
about
anything
.
Such
was
his
outlook
on
life
.
*NL*
Madame
de
la
Mole
would
have
been
happy
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
*NL*
if
she
could
have
made
him
her
daughter
's
husband
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
PRONUNCIATION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
fatuity
is
pardonable
it
is
in
one
's
first
youth
,
*NL*
for
it
is
then
the
exaggeration
of
an
amiable
thing
.
It
*NL*
needs
an
air
of
love
,
gaiety
,
nonchalance
.
But
fatuity
*NL*
coupled
with
self-importance
;
fatuity
with
a
solemn
and
*NL*
self-sufficient
manner
!
This
extravagance
of
stupidity
*NL*
was
reserved
for
the
XIXth
century
.
Such
are
the
persons
*NL*
who
want
to
unchain
the
_
hydra
of
revolutions
_
!

LE
*NL*
JOHANNISBURG

*NL*
*NL*
Considering
that
he
was
a
new
arrival
who
was
too
disdainful
to
put
any
*NL*
questions
,
Julien
did
not
fall
into
unduly
great
mistakes
.
One
day
when
*NL*
he
was
forced
into
a
cafe
in
the
Rue
St.
Honore
by
a
sudden
shower
,
*NL*
a
big
man
in
a
beaver
coat
,
surprised
by
his
gloomy
look
,
looked
at
*NL*
him
in
return
just
as
mademoiselle
Amanda
's
lover
had
done
before
at
*NL*
Besancon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
reproached
himself
too
often
for
having
endured
the
other
*NL*
insult
to
put
up
with
this
stare
.
He
asked
for
an
explanation
.
The
*NL*
man
in
the
tail-coat
immediately
addressed
him
in
the
lowest
and
most
*NL*
insulting
language
.
All
the
people
in
the
cafe
surrounded
them
.
The
*NL*
passers-by
stopped
before
the
door
.
Julien
always
carried
some
little
*NL*
pistols
as
a
matter
of
precaution
.
His
hand
was
grasping
them
nervously
*NL*
in
his
pocket
.
Nevertheless
he
behaved
wisely
and
confined
himself
to
*NL*
repeating
to
his
man
``
Monsieur
,
your
address
,
I
despise
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
persistency
in
which
he
kept
repeating
these
six
words
eventually
*NL*
impressed
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove
,
the
other
who
's
talking
all
to
himself
ought
to
give
him
*NL*
his
address
,
''
they
exclaimed
.
The
man
in
the
tail-coat
hearing
this
*NL*
repeated
several
times
,
flung
five
or
six
cards
in
Julien
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
none
of
them
hit
him
in
the
face
;
he
had
mentally
resolved
*NL*
not
to
use
his
pistols
except
in
the
event
of
his
being
hit
.
The
man
*NL*
went
away
,
though
not
without
turning
round
from
time
to
time
to
shake
*NL*
his
fist
and
hurl
insults
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
bathed
in
sweat
.
``
So
,
''
he
said
angrily
to
himself
,
``
the
*NL*
meanest
of
mankind
has
it
in
his
power
to
affect
me
as
much
as
this
.
*NL*
How
am
I
to
kill
so
humiliating
a
sensitiveness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Where
was
he
to
find
a
second
?
He
did
not
have
a
single
friend
.
He
had
*NL*
several
acquaintances
,
but
they
all
regularly
left
him
after
six
weeks
*NL*
of
social
intercourse
.
``
I
am
unsociable
,
''
he
thought
,
and
``
I
am
now
*NL*
cruelly
punished
for
it
.
''
Finally
it
occurred
to
him
to
rout
out
an
old
*NL*
lieutenant
of
the
96th
,
named
Lievin
,
a
poor
devil
with
whom
he
often
*NL*
used
to
fence
.
Julien
was
frank
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
willing
to
be
your
second
,
''
said
Lievin
,
``
but
on
one
*NL*
condition
.
If
you
fail
to
wound
your
man
you
will
fight
with
me
*NL*
straight
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agreed
,
''
said
Julien
quite
delighted
;
and
they
went
to
find
M.
de
*NL*
Beauvoisis
at
the
address
indicated
on
his
card
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
Faubourg
Saint
Germain
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
It
was
only
when
he
was
being
*NL*
ushered
in
,
that
Julien
thought
that
it
might
quite
well
be
the
young
*NL*
relation
of
Madame
de
Renal
,
who
had
once
been
employed
at
the
Rome
*NL*
or
Naples
Embassy
,
and
who
had
given
the
singer
Geronimo
a
letter
of
*NL*
introduction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
gave
one
of
the
cards
which
had
been
flung
at
him
the
previous
*NL*
evening
together
with
one
of
his
own
to
a
tall
valet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
his
second
were
kept
waiting
for
a
good
three-quarters
of
*NL*
an
hour
.
Eventually
they
were
ushered
in
to
a
elegantly
furnished
*NL*
apartment
.
They
found
there
a
tall
young
man
who
was
dressed
like
a
*NL*
doll
.
His
features
presented
the
perfection
and
the
lack
of
expression
*NL*
of
Greek
beauty
.
His
head
,
which
was
remarkably
straight
,
had
the
*NL*
finest
blonde
hair
.
It
was
dressed
with
great
care
and
not
a
single
*NL*
hair
was
out
of
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
to
have
his
hair
done
like
this
,
that
is
why
this
damned
*NL*
fop
has
kept
us
waiting
,
''
thought
the
lieutenant
of
the
96th
.
The
*NL*
variegated
dressing
gown
,
the
morning
trousers
,
everything
down
to
the
*NL*
embroidered
slippers
was
correct
.
He
was
marvellously
well-groomed
.
*NL*
His
blank
and
aristocratic
physiognomy
betokened
rare
and
orthodox
*NL*
ideas
;
the
ideal
of
a
Metternichian
diplomatist
.
Napoleon
as
well
did
*NL*
not
like
to
have
in
his
entourage
officers
who
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
,
to
whom
his
lieutenant
of
the
96th
had
explained
,
that
keeping
*NL*
him
waiting
was
an
additional
insult
after
having
thrown
his
card
*NL*
so
rudely
in
his
face
,
entered
brusquely
M.
de
Beauvoisis
'
room
.
He
*NL*
intended
to
be
insolent
,
but
at
the
same
time
to
exhibit
good
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
so
astonished
by
the
niceness
of
M.
de
Beauvoisis
'
*NL*
manners
and
by
the
combination
of
formality
,
self-importance
,
and
*NL*
self-satisfaction
in
his
demeanour
,
by
the
admirable
elegance
of
*NL*
everything
that
surrounded
him
,
that
he
abandoned
immediately
all
*NL*
idea
of
being
insolent
.
It
was
not
his
man
of
the
day
before
.
His
*NL*
astonishment
was
so
great
at
meeting
so
distinguished
a
person
,
instead
*NL*
of
the
rude
creature
whom
he
was
looking
for
,
that
he
could
not
find
a
*NL*
single
word
to
say
.
He
presented
one
of
the
cards
which
had
been
thrown
*NL*
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
my
name
,
''
said
the
young
diplomat
,
not
at
all
impressed
by
*NL*
Julien
's
black
suit
at
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
``
but
I
do
not
*NL*
understand
the
honour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
manner
of
pronouncing
these
last
words
revived
a
little
of
Julien
's
*NL*
bad
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
to
fight
you
,
monsieur
,
''
and
he
explained
in
a
few
words
*NL*
the
whole
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Charles
de
Beauvoisis
,
after
mature
reflection
,
was
fairly
satisfied
*NL*
with
the
cut
of
Julien
's
black
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
comes
from
Staub
,
that
's
clear
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
as
he
heard
*NL*
him
speak
.
``
That
waistcoat
is
in
good
taste
.
Those
boots
are
all
right
,
*NL*
but
on
the
other
hand
just
think
of
wearing
a
black
suit
in
the
early
*NL*
morning
!
It
must
be
to
have
a
better
chance
of
not
being
hit
,
''
said
the
*NL*
chevalier
de
Beauvoisis
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
given
himself
this
explanation
he
became
again
perfectly
*NL*
polite
to
Julien
,
and
almost
treated
him
as
an
equal
.
The
conversation
*NL*
was
fairly
lengthy
,
for
the
matter
was
a
delicate
one
,
but
eventually
*NL*
Julien
could
not
refuse
to
acknowledge
the
actual
facts
.
The
perfectly
*NL*
mannered
young
man
before
him
did
not
bear
any
resemblance
to
the
*NL*
vulgar
fellow
who
had
insulted
him
the
previous
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
felt
an
invincible
repugnance
towards
him
.
He
noted
the
*NL*
self-sufficiency
of
the
chevalier
de
Beauvoisis
,
for
that
was
the
name
*NL*
by
which
he
had
referred
to
himself
,
shocked
as
he
was
when
Julien
*NL*
called
him
simply
``
Monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
admired
his
gravity
which
,
though
tinged
with
a
certain
modest
*NL*
fatuity
,
he
never
abandoned
for
a
single
moment
.
He
was
astonished
at
*NL*
his
singular
manner
of
moving
his
tongue
as
he
pronounced
his
words
,
*NL*
but
after
all
,
this
did
not
present
the
slightest
excuse
for
picking
a
*NL*
quarrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
diplomatist
very
graciously
offered
to
fight
,
but
the
*NL*
ex-lieutenant
of
the
96th
,
who
had
been
sitting
down
for
an
hour
with
*NL*
his
legs
wide
apart
,
his
hands
on
his
thigh
,
and
his
elbows
stuck
out
,
*NL*
decided
that
his
friend
,
monsieur
de
Sorel
,
was
not
the
kind
to
go
and
*NL*
pick
a
quarrel
with
a
man
because
someone
else
had
stolen
that
man
's
*NL*
visiting
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
went
out
in
a
very
bad
temper
.
The
chevalier
de
Beauvoisis
'
*NL*
carriage
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
courtyard
before
the
steps
.
By
*NL*
chance
Julien
raised
his
eyes
and
recognised
in
the
coachman
his
man
of
*NL*
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
him
,
catching
hold
of
him
by
his
big
jacket
,
tumbling
him
down
*NL*
from
his
seat
,
and
horse-whipping
him
thoroughly
took
scarcely
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
lackeys
tried
to
defend
their
comrade
.
Julien
received
some
blows
*NL*
from
their
fists
.
At
the
same
moment
,
he
cocked
one
of
his
little
*NL*
pistols
and
fired
on
them
.
They
took
to
flight
.
All
this
took
about
a
*NL*
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chevalier
de
Beauvoisis
descended
the
staircase
with
the
most
*NL*
pleasing
gravity
,
repeating
with
his
lordly
pronunciation
,
``
What
is
*NL*
this
,
what
is
this
.
''
He
was
manifestly
very
curious
,
but
his
diplomatic
*NL*
importance
would
not
allow
him
to
evince
any
greater
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
knew
what
it
was
all
about
,
a
certain
haughtiness
tried
to
*NL*
assert
itself
in
that
expression
of
slightly
playful
nonchalance
which
*NL*
should
never
leave
a
diplomatist
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
of
the
96th
began
to
realise
that
M.
de
Beauvoisis
was
*NL*
anxious
to
fight
.
He
was
also
diplomatic
enough
to
wish
to
reserve
for
*NL*
his
friend
the
advantage
of
taking
the
initiative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
time
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
there
is
ground
for
duel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
there
's
enough
,
''
answered
the
diplomat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Turn
that
rascal
out
,
''
he
said
to
his
lackeys
.
``
Let
someone
else
get
*NL*
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
carriage
was
open
.
The
chevalier
insisted
on
doing
*NL*
the
honours
to
Julien
and
his
friend
.
They
sent
for
a
friend
of
M.
de
*NL*
Beauvoisis
,
who
chose
them
a
quiet
place
.
The
conversation
on
their
*NL*
way
went
as
a
matter
of
fact
very
well
indeed
.
The
only
extraordinary
*NL*
feature
was
the
diplomatist
in
a
dressing-gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
gentlemen
,
although
very
noble
,
are
by
no
means
as
boring
,
''
*NL*
thought
Julien
,
``
as
the
people
who
come
and
dine
at
M.
de
la
Mole
's
,
*NL*
and
I
can
see
why
,
''
he
added
a
moment
afterwards
.
``
They
allow
*NL*
themselves
to
be
indecent
.
''
They
talked
about
the
dancers
that
the
*NL*
public
had
distinguished
with
its
favour
at
the
ballet
presented
*NL*
the
night
before
.
The
two
gentlemen
alluded
to
some
spicy
anecdotes
*NL*
of
which
Julien
and
his
second
,
the
lieutenant
of
the
96th
,
were
*NL*
absolutely
ignorant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
not
stupid
enough
to
pretend
to
know
them
.
He
confessed
his
*NL*
ignorance
with
a
good
grace
.
This
frankness
pleased
the
chevalier
's
*NL*
friend
.
He
told
him
these
stories
with
the
greatest
detail
and
*NL*
extremely
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
astonished
Julien
inordinately
.
The
carriage
was
pulled
up
*NL*
for
a
moment
by
an
altar
which
was
being
built
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
street
for
the
procession
of
Corpus
Christi
Day
.
The
two
gentlemen
*NL*
indulged
in
the
luxury
of
several
jests
.
According
to
them
,
the
cure
*NL*
was
the
son
of
an
archbishop
.
Such
a
joke
would
never
have
been
heard
*NL*
in
the
house
of
M.
de
la
Mole
,
who
was
trying
to
be
made
a
duke
.
The
*NL*
duel
was
over
in
a
minute
.
Julien
got
a
ball
in
his
arm
.
They
bandaged
*NL*
it
with
handkerchiefs
which
they
wetted
with
brandy
,
and
the
chevalier
*NL*
de
Beauvoisis
requested
Julien
with
great
politeness
to
allow
him
to
*NL*
take
him
home
in
the
same
carriage
that
had
brought
him
.
When
Julien
*NL*
gave
the
name
of
M.
de
la
Mole
's
hotel
,
the
young
diplomat
and
his
*NL*
friend
exchanged
looks
.
Julien
's
fiacre
was
here
,
but
they
found
these
*NL*
gentlemen
's
conversation
more
entertaining
than
that
of
the
good
*NL*
lieutenant
of
the
96th
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove
,
so
a
duel
is
only
that
,
''
thought
Julien
.
``
What
luck
I
found
*NL*
that
coachman
again
.
How
unhappy
I
should
have
been
if
I
had
had
to
put
*NL*
up
with
that
insult
as
well
.
''
The
amusing
conversation
had
scarcely
*NL*
been
interrupted
.
Julien
realised
that
the
affectation
of
diplomatists
*NL*
is
good
for
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
ennui
,
''
he
said
himself
,
``
is
not
a
necessary
incident
of
*NL*
conversation
among
well-born
people
.
These
gentlemen
make
fun
of
the
*NL*
Corpus
Christi
procession
and
dare
to
tell
extremely
obscene
anecdotes
,
*NL*
and
what
is
more
,
with
picturesque
details
.
The
only
thing
they
really
*NL*
lack
is
the
ability
to
discuss
politics
logically
,
and
that
lack
is
*NL*
more
than
compensated
by
their
graceful
tone
,
and
the
perfect
aptness
*NL*
of
their
expressions
.
''
Julien
experienced
a
lively
inclination
for
*NL*
them
.
``
How
happy
I
should
be
to
see
them
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
scarcely
taken
leave
of
each
other
before
the
chevalier
de
*NL*
Beauvoisis
had
enquiries
made
.
They
were
not
brilliant
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
curious
to
know
his
man
.
Could
he
decently
pay
a
call
on
*NL*
him
?
The
little
information
he
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
him
was
*NL*
not
of
an
encouraging
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
this
is
awful
,
''
he
said
to
his
second
.
``
I
ca
n't
possibly
own
up
*NL*
to
having
fought
a
duel
with
a
mere
secretary
of
M.
de
la
Mole
,
simply
*NL*
because
my
coachman
stole
my
visiting
cards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
doubt
that
all
this
may
make
you
look
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
very
evening
the
chevalier
de
Beauvoisis
and
his
friend
said
*NL*
everywhere
that
this
M.
Sorel
who
was
,
moreover
,
quite
a
charming
young
*NL*
man
,
was
a
natural
son
of
an
intimate
friend
of
the
marquis
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
This
statement
was
readily
accepted
.
Once
it
was
established
,
the
young
*NL*
diplomatist
and
friend
deigned
to
call
several
times
on
Julien
during
*NL*
the
fortnight
.
Julien
owned
to
them
that
he
had
only
been
to
the
Opera
*NL*
once
in
his
life
.
``
That
is
awful
,
''
said
one
,
``
that
is
the
only
place
*NL*
one
does
go
to
.
Your
first
visit
must
be
when
they
are
playing
the
*NL*
'
_
Comte
Ory
_
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chevalier
de
Beauvoisis
introduced
him
at
the
opera
to
the
famous
*NL*
singer
Geronimo
,
who
was
then
enjoying
an
immense
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
almost
paid
court
to
the
chevalier
.
His
mixture
of
self-respect
,
*NL*
mysterious
self-importance
,
and
fatuous
youthfulness
fascinated
him
.
*NL*
The
chevalier
,
for
example
,
would
stammer
a
little
,
simply
because
he
*NL*
had
the
honour
of
seeing
frequently
a
very
noble
lord
who
had
this
*NL*
defect
.
Julien
had
never
before
found
combined
in
one
and
the
same
*NL*
person
the
drollery
which
amuses
,
and
those
perfect
manners
which
*NL*
should
be
the
object
of
a
poor
provincial
's
imitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
seen
at
the
opera
with
the
chevalier
de
Beauvoisis
.
This
*NL*
association
got
him
talked
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
M.
de
la
Mole
to
him
one
day
,
``
so
here
you
are
,
the
*NL*
natural
son
of
a
rich
gentleman
of
Franche-Comte
,
an
intimate
friend
of
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
cut
Julien
short
as
he
started
to
protest
that
he
had
not
*NL*
in
any
way
contributed
to
obtaining
any
credence
for
this
rumour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
de
Beauvoisis
did
not
fancy
having
fought
a
duel
with
the
son
of
a
*NL*
carpenter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
I
know
it
,
''
said
M.
de
la
Mole
.
``
It
is
my
business
now
to
*NL*
give
some
consistency
to
this
story
which
rather
suits
me
.
But
I
have
*NL*
one
favour
to
ask
of
you
,
which
will
only
cost
you
a
bare
half-hour
of
*NL*
your
time

Go
and
watch
every
opera
day
at
half-past
eleven
all
the
*NL*
people
in
society
coming
out
in
the
vestibule

I
still
see
you
have
*NL*
certain
provincial
mannerisms
.
You
must
rid
yourself
of
them

Besides
*NL*
it
would
do
no
harm
to
know
,
at
any
rate
by
sight
,
some
of
the
great

one

send

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
AN
ATTACK
OF
GOUT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
got
advancement
,
not
on
my
merit
,
but
because
my
*NL*
master
had
the
gout
.
--
_
Bertolotti
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
is
perhaps
surprised
by
this
free
and
almost
friendly
tone
.
*NL*
We
had
forgotten
to
say
that
the
marquis
had
been
confined
to
his
house
*NL*
for
six
weeks
by
the
gout
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
and
her
mother
were
at
Hyeres
near
the
*NL*
marquise
's
mother
.
The
comte
Norbert
only
saw
his
father
at
stray
*NL*
moments
.
They
got
on
very
well
,
but
had
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
.
*NL*
M.
de
la
Mole
,
reduced
to
Julien
's
society
,
was
astonished
to
find
that
*NL*
he
possessed
ideas
.
He
made
him
read
the
papers
to
him
.
Soon
the
young
*NL*
secretary
was
competent
to
pick
out
the
interesting
passages
.
There
was
*NL*
a
new
paper
which
the
marquis
abhorred
.
He
had
sworn
never
to
read
it
,
*NL*
and
spoke
about
it
every
day
.
Julien
laughed
.
In
his
irritation
against
*NL*
the
present
time
,
the
marquis
made
him
read
Livy
aloud
.
The
improvised
*NL*
translation
of
the
Latin
text
amused
him
.
The
marquis
said
one
day
*NL*
in
that
tone
of
excessive
politeness
which
frequently
tried
Julien
's
*NL*
patience
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
present
you
with
a
blue
suit
,
my
dear
Sorel
.
When
you
find
*NL*
it
convenient
to
wear
it
and
to
come
and
see
me
,
I
shall
look
upon
you
*NL*
as
the
younger
brother
of
the
comte
de
Chaulnes
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
*NL*
son
of
my
friend
the
old
Duke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
did
not
quite
gather
what
it
was
all
about
,
but
he
tried
a
visit
*NL*
in
the
blue
suit
that
very
evening
.
The
marquis
treated
him
like
an
*NL*
equal
.
Julien
had
a
spirit
capable
of
appreciating
true
politeness
,
but
*NL*
he
had
no
idea
of
nuances
.
Before
this
freak
of
the
marquis
's
he
would
*NL*
have
sworn
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
have
been
treated
with
*NL*
more
consideration
.
``
What
an
admirable
talent
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
*NL*
When
he
got
up
to
go
,
the
marquis
apologised
for
not
being
able
to
*NL*
accompany
him
by
reason
of
his
gout
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
preoccupied
by
this
strange
idea
.
``
Perhaps
he
is
making
fun
*NL*
of
me
,
''
he
thought
.
He
went
to
ask
advice
of
the
abbe
Pirard
,
who
being
*NL*
less
polite
than
the
marquis
,
made
no
other
answer
except
to
whistle
*NL*
and
change
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
presented
himself
to
the
marquis
the
next
morning
in
his
black
*NL*
suit
,
with
his
letter
case
and
his
letters
for
signature
.
He
was
*NL*
received
in
the
old
way
,
but
when
he
wore
the
blue
suit
that
evening
,
*NL*
the
marquis
's
tone
was
quite
different
,
and
absolutely
as
polite
as
on
*NL*
the
previous
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
are
not
exactly
bored
,
''
said
the
marquis
to
him
,
``
by
these
*NL*
visits
which
you
are
kind
enough
to
pay
to
a
poor
old
man
,
you
must
*NL*
tell
him
about
all
the
little
incidents
of
your
life
,
but
you
must
*NL*
be
frank
and
think
of
nothing
except
narrating
them
clearly
and
in
*NL*
an
amusing
way
.
For
one
must
amuse
oneself
,
''
continued
the
marquis
.
*NL*
``
That
's
the
only
reality
in
life
.
I
ca
n't
have
my
life
saved
in
a
*NL*
battle
every
day
,
or
get
a
present
of
a
million
francs
every
day
,
but
*NL*
if
I
had
Rivarol
here
by
my
sofa
he
would
rid
me
every
day
of
an
hour
*NL*
of
suffering
and
boredom
.
I
saw
a
lot
of
him
at
Hamburg
during
the
*NL*
emigration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
marquis
told
Julien
the
stories
of
Rivarol
and
the
inhabitants
*NL*
of
Hamburg
who
needed
the
combined
efforts
of
four
individuals
to
*NL*
understand
an
epigram
.
M.
de
la
Mole
,
being
reduced
to
the
society
of
*NL*
this
little
abbe
,
tried
to
teach
him
.
He
put
Julien
's
pride
on
its
*NL*
mettle
.
As
he
was
asked
to
speak
the
truth
,
Julien
resolved
to
tell
*NL*
everything
,
but
to
suppress
two
things
,
his
fanatical
admiration
for
*NL*
the
name
which
irritated
the
marquis
,
and
that
complete
scepticism
,
*NL*
which
was
not
particularly
appropriate
to
a
prospective
cure
.
His
*NL*
little
affair
with
the
chevalier
de
Beauvoisis
came
in
very
handy
.
The
*NL*
marquis
laughed
till
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
at
the
scene
in
the
*NL*
cafe
in
the
Rue
St.
Honore
with
the
coachman
who
had
loaded
him
with
*NL*
sordid
insults
.
The
occasion
was
marked
by
a
complete
frankness
between
*NL*
the
marquis
and
the
protege
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
la
Mole
became
interested
in
this
singular
character
.
At
the
*NL*
beginning
he
had
encouraged
Julian
's
droll
blunders
in
order
to
enjoy
*NL*
laughing
at
them
.
Soon
he
found
it
more
interesting
to
correct
very
*NL*
gently
this
young
man
's
false
outlook
on
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
other
provincials
who
come
to
Paris
admire
everything
,
''
*NL*
thought
the
marquis
.
``
This
one
hates
everything
.
They
have
too
much
*NL*
affectation
;
he
has
not
affectation
enough
;
and
fools
take
him
for
a
*NL*
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
attack
of
gout
was
protracted
by
the
great
winter
cold
and
lasted
*NL*
some
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
gets
quite
attached
to
a
fine
spaniel
,
''
thought
the
marquis
.
``
Why
*NL*
should
I
be
so
ashamed
of
being
attached
to
this
little
abbe
?
He
is
*NL*
original
.
I
treat
him
as
a
son
.
Well
,
where
's
the
bother
?
The
whim
,
if
*NL*
it
lasts
,
will
cost
me
a
diamond
and
five
hundred
louis
in
my
will
.
''
*NL*
Once
the
marquis
had
realised
his
protege
's
strength
of
character
,
he
*NL*
entrusted
him
with
some
new
business
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
noticed
with
alarm
that
this
great
lord
would
often
give
him
*NL*
inconsistent
orders
with
regard
to
the
same
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
might
compromise
him
seriously
.
Julien
now
made
a
point
whenever
*NL*
he
worked
with
him
,
of
bringing
a
register
with
him
in
which
he
wrote
*NL*
his
instructions
which
the
marquis
initialled
.
Julien
had
now
a
clerk
*NL*
who
would
transcribe
the
instructions
relating
to
each
matter
in
a
*NL*
separate
book
.
This
book
also
contained
a
copy
of
all
the
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
seemed
at
first
absolutely
boring
and
ridiculous
,
but
in
two
*NL*
months
the
marquis
appreciated
its
advantages
.
Julien
suggested
to
him
*NL*
that
he
should
take
a
clerk
out
of
a
banker
's
who
was
to
keep
proper
*NL*
book-keeping
accounts
of
all
the
receipts
and
of
all
the
expenses
of
*NL*
the
estates
which
Julien
had
been
charged
to
administer
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
measures
so
enlightened
the
marquis
as
to
his
own
affairs
that
*NL*
he
could
indulge
the
pleasure
of
undertaking
two
or
three
speculations
*NL*
without
the
help
of
his
nominee
who
always
robbed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
three
thousand
francs
for
yourself
,
''
he
said
one
day
to
his
young
*NL*
steward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
I
should
lay
myself
open
to
calumny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
then
?
''
retorted
the
marquis
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
make
out
a
statement
of
account
and
*NL*
enter
it
in
your
own
hand
in
the
book
.
That
order
will
give
me
a
sum
of
*NL*
3,000
francs
.
Besides
it
's
M.
the
abbe
Pirard
who
had
the
idea
of
all
*NL*
this
exactness
in
accounts
.
''
The
marquis
wrote
out
his
instructions
in
*NL*
the
register
with
the
bored
air
of
the
Marquis
de
Moncade
listening
to
*NL*
the
accounts
of
his
steward
M.
Poisson
.
*NL*
*NL*
Business
was
never
talked
when
Julien
appeared
in
the
evening
in
*NL*
his
blue
suit
.
The
kindness
of
the
marquis
was
so
flattering
to
the
*NL*
self-respect
of
our
hero
,
which
was
always
morbidly
sensitive
,
that
*NL*
in
spite
of
himself
,
he
soon
came
to
feel
a
kind
of
attachment
for
*NL*
this
nice
old
man
.
It
is
not
that
Julien
was
a
man
of
sensibility
*NL*
as
the
phrase
is
understood
at
Paris
,
but
he
was
not
a
monster
,
and
*NL*
no
one
since
the
death
of
the
old
major
had
talked
to
him
with
so
*NL*
much
kindness
.
He
observed
that
the
marquis
showed
a
politeness
and
*NL*
consideration
for
his
own
personal
feelings
which
he
had
never
found
in
*NL*
the
old
surgeon
.
He
now
realised
that
the
surgeon
was
much
prouder
of
*NL*
his
cross
than
was
the
marquis
of
his
blue
ribbon
.
The
marquis
's
father
*NL*
had
been
a
great
lord
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
at
the
end
of
a
morning
audience
for
the
transaction
of
*NL*
business
,
when
the
black
suit
was
worn
,
Julien
happened
to
amuse
the
*NL*
marquis
who
kept
him
for
a
couple
of
hours
,
and
insisted
on
giving
him
*NL*
some
banknotes
which
his
nominee
had
just
brought
from
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
M.
le
Marquis
,
that
I
am
not
deviating
from
the
profound
*NL*
respect
which
I
owe
you
,
if
I
beg
you
to
allow
me
to
say
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
my
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
le
Marquis
will
deign
to
allow
me
to
refuse
this
gift
.
It
is
not
*NL*
meant
for
the
man
in
the
black
suit
,
and
it
would
completely
spoil
*NL*
those
manners
which
you
have
kindly
put
up
with
in
the
man
in
the
blue
*NL*
suit
.
''
He
saluted
with
much
respect
and
went
out
without
looking
at
his
*NL*
employer
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
incident
amused
the
marquis
.
He
told
it
in
the
evening
to
the
abbe
*NL*
Pirard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
confess
one
thing
to
you
,
my
dear
abbe
.
I
know
Julien
's
birth
,
*NL*
and
I
authorise
you
not
to
regard
this
confidence
as
a
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
conduct
this
morning
is
noble
,
thought
the
marquis
,
so
I
will
*NL*
ennoble
him
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
afterwards
the
marquis
was
able
to
go
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
pass
a
couple
of
months
at
London
,
''
he
said
to
Julien
.
*NL*
``
Ordinary
and
special
couriers
will
bring
you
the
letters
I
have
*NL*
received
,
together
with
my
notes
.
You
will
write
out
the
answers
and
*NL*
send
them
back
to
me
,
putting
each
letter
inside
the
answer
.
I
have
*NL*
ascertained
that
the
delay
will
be
no
more
than
five
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
took
the
post
down
the
Calais
route
,
Julien
was
astonished
at
the
*NL*
triviality
of
the
alleged
business
on
which
he
had
been
sent
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
say
nothing
about
the
feeling
of
hate
and
almost
horror
with
*NL*
which
he
touched
English
soil
.
His
mad
passion
for
Bonaparte
is
already
*NL*
known
.
He
saw
in
every
officer
a
Sir
Hudson
Low
,
in
every
great
*NL*
noble
a
Lord
Bathurst
,
ordering
the
infamies
of
St.
Helena
and
being
*NL*
recompensed
by
six
years
of
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
London
he
really
got
to
know
the
meaning
of
sublime
fatuity
.
He
had
*NL*
struck
up
a
friendship
with
some
young
Russian
nobles
who
initiated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
future
is
assured
,
my
dear
Sorel
,
''
they
said
to
him
.
``
You
*NL*
naturally
have
that
cold
demeanour
,
_
a
thousand
leagues
away
from
the
*NL*
sensation
one
has
at
the
moment
_
,
that
we
have
been
making
such
efforts
*NL*
to
acquire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
understood
your
century
,
''
said
the
Prince
Korasoff
to
*NL*
him
.
``
Always
do
the
opposite
of
what
is
expected
of
you
.
On
my
honour
*NL*
there
you
have
the
sole
religion
of
the
period
.
Do
n't
be
foolish
or
*NL*
affected
,
for
then
follies
and
affectations
will
be
expected
of
you
,
*NL*
and
the
maxim
will
not
longer
prove
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
covered
himself
with
glory
one
day
in
the
Salon
of
the
Duke
*NL*
of
Fitz-Folke
who
had
invited
him
to
dinner
together
with
the
Prince
*NL*
Korasoff
.
They
waited
for
an
hour
.
The
way
in
which
Julien
conducted
*NL*
himself
in
the
middle
of
twenty
people
who
were
waiting
is
still
quoted
*NL*
as
a
precedent
among
the
young
secretaries
of
the
London
Embassy
.
His
*NL*
demeanour
was
unimpeachable
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
friends
,
the
dandies
,
he
made
a
point
of
seeing
the
*NL*
celebrated
Philip
Vane
,
the
one
philosopher
that
England
has
had
*NL*
since
Locke
.
He
found
him
finishing
his
seventh
year
in
prison
.
The
*NL*
aristocracy
does
n't
joke
in
this
country
,
thought
Julien
.
Moreover
Vane
*NL*
is
disgraced
,
calumniated
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
found
him
in
cheery
spirits
.
The
rage
of
the
aristocracy
*NL*
prevented
him
from
being
bored
.
``
There
's
the
only
merry
man
I
've
seen
*NL*
in
England
,
''
thought
Julien
to
himself
,
as
he
left
the
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
idea
which
tyrants
find
most
useful
is
the
idea
of
God
,
''
Vane
had
*NL*
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
suppress
the
rest
of
the
system
as
being
cynical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
amusing
notion
do
you
bring
me
from
England
?
''
said
M.
la
Mole
to
*NL*
him
on
his
return
.
He
was
silent
.
``
What
notion
do
you
bring
me
,
amusing
*NL*
or
otherwise
?
''
repeated
the
marquis
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
''
said
Julien
,
``
The
sanest
Englishman
is
mad
one
*NL*
hour
every
day
.
He
is
visited
by
the
Demon
of
Suicide
who
is
the
local
*NL*
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
second
place

intellect
and
genius
lose
twenty-five
per
cent

*NL*
of
their
value
when
they
disembark
in
England

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
third
place
,
nothing
in
the
world
is
so
beautiful
,
so
*NL*
admirable
,
so
touching
,
as
the
English
landscapes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
it
is
my
turn
,
''
said
the
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
why
do
you
go
and
say
at
the
ball
at
the
Russian
*NL*
Ambassador
's
that
there
were
three
hundred
thousand
young
men
of
twenty
*NL*
in
France
who
passionately
desire
war
?
Do
you
think
that
is
nice
for
*NL*
the
kings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
does
n't
know
what
to
do
when
talking
to
great
diplomats
,
''
said
*NL*
Julien
.
``
They
have
a
mania
for
starting
serious
discussions
.
If
one
*NL*
confines
oneself
to
the
commonplaces
of
the
papers
,
one
is
taken
for
a
*NL*
fool
.
If
one
indulges
in
some
original
truth
,
they
are
astonished
and
*NL*
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
,
and
get
you
informed
by
the
first
Secretary
*NL*
of
the
Embassy
at
seven
o'clock
next
day
that
your
conduct
has
been
*NL*
unbecoming

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
bad
,
''
said
the
marquis
laughing
.
``
Anyway
I
will
wager
Monsieur
*NL*
Deep-one
that
you
have
not
guessed
what
you
went
to
do
in
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
''
answered
Julien
.
``
I
went
there
to
dine
once
a
week
with
*NL*
the
king
's
ambassador
,
who
is
the
most
polite
of
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
went
to
fetch
this
cross
you
see
here
,
''
said
the
marquis
to
him
.
*NL*
``
I
do
not
want
to
make
you
leave
off
your
black
suit
,
and
I
have
got
*NL*
accustomed
to
the
more
amusing
tone
I
have
assumed
with
the
man
who
*NL*
wears
the
blue
suit
.
So
understand
this
until
further
orders
.
When
I
*NL*
see
this
cross
,
you
will
be
my
friend
,
the
Duke
of
Chaulne
's
younger
*NL*
son
,
who
has
been
employed
in
the
diplomatic
service
the
last
six
*NL*
months
without
having
any
idea
of
it
.
Observe
,
''
added
the
marquis
*NL*
very
seriously
,
cutting
short
all
manifestations
of
thanks
,
``
that
I
*NL*
do
not
want
you
to
forget
your
place
.
That
is
always
a
mistake
and
a
*NL*
misfortune
both
for
patron
and
for
dependent
.
When
my
lawsuits
bore
*NL*
you
,
or
when
you
no
longer
suit
me
,
I
will
ask
a
good
living
like
that
*NL*
of
our
good
friend
the
abbe
Pirard
's
for
you
,
and
nothing
more
,
''
added
*NL*
the
marquis
dryly
.
This
put
Julien
's
pride
at
its
ease
.
He
talked
much
*NL*
more
.
He
did
not
so
frequently
think
himself
insulted
and
aimed
at
by
*NL*
those
phrases
which
are
susceptible
of
some
interpretation
which
is
*NL*
scarcely
polite
,
and
which
anybody
may
give
utterance
to
in
the
course
*NL*
of
an
animated
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
cross
earned
him
a
singular
visit
.
It
was
that
of
the
baron
de
*NL*
Valenod
,
who
came
to
Paris
to
thank
the
Minister
for
his
barony
,
and
*NL*
arrive
at
an
understanding
with
him
.
He
was
going
to
be
nominated
mayor
*NL*
of
Verrieres
,
and
to
supersede
M.
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
did
not
fail
to
smile
to
himself
when
M.
Valenod
gave
him
to
*NL*
understand
that
they
had
just
found
out
that
M.
de
Renal
was
a
Jacobin
.
*NL*
The
fact
was
that
the
new
baron
was
the
ministerial
candidate
at
the
*NL*
election
for
which
they
were
all
getting
ready
,
and
that
it
was
M.
de
*NL*
Renal
who
was
the
Liberal
candidate
at
the
great
electoral
college
of
*NL*
the
department
,
which
was
,
in
fact
,
very
ultra
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
Julien
tried
to
learn
something
about
madame
de
*NL*
Renal
.
The
baron
seemed
to
remember
their
former
rivalry
,
and
was
*NL*
impenetrable
.
He
concluded
by
canvassing
Julien
for
his
father
's
vote
*NL*
at
the
election
which
was
going
to
take
place
.
Julien
promised
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
,
monsieur
le
Chevalier
,
to
present
me
to
M.
the
marquis
de
*NL*
la
Mole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
''
thought
Julien
.
``
But
a
rascal
like
*NL*
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
''
he
answered
,
``
I
am
too
small
a
personage
in
the
*NL*
Hotel
de
la
Mole
to
take
it
upon
myself
to
introduce
anyone
.
''
Julien
*NL*
told
the
marquis
everything
.
In
the
evening
he
described
Valenod
's
*NL*
pretensions
,
as
well
as
his
deeds
and
feats
since
1814
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
only
will
you
present
the
new
baron
to
me

''
replied
de
la
Mole
,
*NL*
very
seriously
,
``
but
I
will
invite
him
to
dinner
for
the
day
after
*NL*
to-morrow
.
He
will
be
one
of
our
new
prefects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
is
the
case
,
I
ask
for
my
father
the
post
of
director
of
the
*NL*
workhouse

''
answered
Julien
,
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
pleasure

answered
the
marquis
gaily
.
``
It
shall
be
granted

I
*NL*
was
expecting
a
lecture
.
You
are
getting
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Valenod
informed
Julien
that
the
manager
of
the
lottery
office
at
*NL*
Verrieres
had
just
died
.
Julien
thought
it
humorous
to
give
that
place
*NL*
to
M.
de
Cholin
,
the
old
dotard
whose
petition
he
had
once
picked
up
in
*NL*
de
la
Mole
's
room
.
The
marquis
laughed
heartily
at
the
petition
,
which
*NL*
Julien
recited
as
he
made
him
sign
the
letter
which
requested
that
*NL*
appointment
of
the
minister
of
finance
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Cholin
had
scarcely
been
nominated
,
when
Julien
learnt
that
that
*NL*
post
had
been
asked
by
the
department
for
the
celebrated
geometrician
,
*NL*
monsieur
Gros
.
That
generous
man
had
an
income
of
only
1400
francs
,
and
*NL*
every
year
had
lent
600
to
the
late
manager
who
had
just
died
,
to
help
*NL*
him
bring
up
his
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
astonished
at
what
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nothing
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
It
will
be
necessary
to
commit
*NL*
several
other
injustices
if
I
mean
to
get
on
,
and
also
to
conceal
them
*NL*
beneath
pretty
,
sentimental
speeches
.
Poor
monsieur
Gros
!
It
is
he
who
*NL*
deserves
the
cross
.
It
is
I
who
have
it
,
and
I
ought
to
conform
to
the
*NL*
spirit
of
the
Government
which
gives
it
me

WHAT
IS
THE
DECORATION

``

not

One
day
Julien
had
just
returned
from
the
charming
estate
of
Villequier
*NL*
on
the
banks
of
the
Seine
,
which
was
the
especial
subject
of
M.
de
la
*NL*
Mole
's
interest
because
it
was
the
only
one
of
all
his
properties
which
*NL*
had
belonged
to
the
celebrated
Boniface
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
the
marquise
and
her
daughter
,
who
had
just
come
back
from
*NL*
Hyeres
,
in
the
hotel
.
Julien
was
a
dandy
now
,
and
understood
the
art
of
*NL*
Paris
life
.
He
manifested
a
perfect
coldness
towards
mademoiselle
de
la
*NL*
Mole
.
He
seemed
to
have
retained
no
recollection
of
the
day
when
she
*NL*
had
asked
him
so
gaily
for
details
of
his
fall
from
his
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
thought
that
he
had
grown
taller
and
paler
.
*NL*
There
was
no
longer
anything
of
the
provincial
in
his
figure
or
his
*NL*
appearance
.
It
was
not
so
with
his
conversation
.
Too
much
of
the
*NL*
serious
and
too
much
of
the
positive
element
were
still
noticeable
.
In
*NL*
spite
of
these
sober
qualities
,
his
conversation
,
thanks
to
his
pride
,
*NL*
was
destitute
of
any
trace
of
the
subordinate
.
One
simply
felt
that
*NL*
there
were
still
too
many
things
which
he
took
seriously
.
But
one
saw
*NL*
that
he
was
the
kind
of
man
to
stick
to
his
guns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
lacks
lightness
of
touch
,
but
not
brains
,
''
said
mademoiselle
de
la
*NL*
Mole
to
her
father
,
as
she
rallied
him
on
the
cross
that
he
had
given
*NL*
Julien
.
``
My
brother
has
been
asking
you
for
it
for
sixteen
months
,
and
*NL*
he
is
a
La
Mole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
Julien
has
surprises
,
and
that
's
what
the
de
la
Mole
,
whom
*NL*
you
were
referring
to
,
has
never
been
guilty
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
the
duc
de
Retz
was
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
felt
herself
seized
by
an
irresistible
attack
of
yawning
.
She
*NL*
knew
so
well
the
old
gildings
and
the
old
habitues
of
her
father
's
*NL*
salon
.
She
conjured
up
an
absolutely
boring
picture
of
the
life
which
*NL*
she
was
going
to
take
up
at
Paris
,
and
yet
,
when
at
Hyeres
,
she
had
*NL*
regretted
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
am
nineteen
,
''
she
thought
.
``
That
's
the
age
of
happiness
,
say
*NL*
all
those
gilt-edged
ninnies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
eight
or
ten
new
volumes
of
poetry
which
had
accumulated
*NL*
on
the
table
in
the
salon
during
her
journey
in
Provence
.
She
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
to
have
more
brains
than
M.M.
de
Croisnois
,
de
Caylus
,
de
*NL*
Luz
,
and
her
other
friends
.
She
anticipated
all
that
they
were
going
to
*NL*
tell
her
about
the
fine
sky
of
Provence
,
poetry
,
the
South
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
fine
eyes
,
which
were
the
home
of
the
deepest
ennui
,
and
worse
*NL*
still
,
of
the
despair
of
ever
finding
pleasure
,
lingered
on
Julien
.
At
*NL*
any
rate
,
he
was
not
exactly
like
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Sorel
,
''
she
said
,
in
that
short
,
sharp
voice
,
destitute
of
*NL*
all
femininity
,
which
is
so
frequent
among
young
women
of
the
upper
*NL*
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Sorel
,
are
you
coming
to-night
to
M.
de
Retz
's
ball
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
,
I
have
not
had
the
honour
of
being
presented
to
M.
the
*NL*
duke
.
''
-LRB-
One
would
have
said
that
these
words
and
that
title
seared
the
*NL*
mouth
of
the
proud
provincial
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
asked
my
brother
to
take
you
there
,
and
if
you
go
,
you
could
*NL*
tell
me
some
details
about
the
Villequier
estate
.
We
are
thinking
of
*NL*
going
there
in
the
spring
,
and
I
would
like
to
know
if
the
chateau
is
*NL*
habitable
,
and
if
the
neighbouring
places
are
as
pretty
as
they
say
.
*NL*
There
are
so
many
unmerited
reputations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
the
ball
with
my
brother
,
''
she
added
,
very
dryly
.
Julien
bowed
*NL*
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
owe
my
due
to
the
members
of
the
family
,
even
in
the
middle
of
a
*NL*
ball
.
Am
I
not
paid
to
be
their
business
man
?
''
His
bad
temper
added
,
*NL*
``
God
knows
,
moreover
,
if
what
I
tell
the
daughter
will
not
put
out
the
*NL*
plans
of
the
father
,
brother
,
and
mother
.
It
is
just
like
the
court
of
*NL*
a
sovereign
prince
.
You
have
to
be
absolutely
negative
,
and
yet
give
no
*NL*
one
any
right
to
complain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
that
big
girl
displeases
me
!
''
he
thought
,
as
he
watched
the
walk
*NL*
of
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
whom
her
mother
had
called
to
present
to
*NL*
several
women
friends
of
hers
.
She
exaggerates
all
the
fashions
.
Her
*NL*
dress
almost
falls
down
to
her
shoulders
,
she
is
even
paler
than
before
*NL*
she
went
away
.
How
nondescript
her
hair
has
grown
as
the
result
of
*NL*
being
blonde
!
You
would
say
that
the
light
passed
through
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
haughty
way
of
bowing
and
of
looking
at
you
!
What
queenly
*NL*
gestures
!
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
had
just
called
her
brother
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
was
leaving
the
salon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
comte
de
Norbert
approached
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Sorel
,
''
he
said
to
him
.
``
Where
would
you
like
me
to
pick
you
*NL*
up
to-night
for
Monsieur
's
ball
.
He
expressly
asked
me
to
bring
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
well
whom
I
have
to
thank
for
so
much
kindness
,
''
answered
*NL*
Julien
bowing
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
bad
temper
,
being
unable
to
find
anything
to
lay
hold
of
in
the
*NL*
polite
and
almost
sympathetic
tone
in
which
Norbert
had
spoken
to
*NL*
him
,
set
itself
to
work
on
the
answer
he
had
made
to
that
courteous
*NL*
invitation
.
He
detected
in
it
a
trace
of
subservience
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
arrived
at
the
ball
in
the
evening
,
he
was
struck
with
the
*NL*
magnificence
of
the
Hotel
de
Retz
.
The
courtyard
at
the
entrance
was
*NL*
covered
with
an
immense
tent
of
crimson
with
golden
stars
.
Nothing
*NL*
could
have
been
more
elegant
.
Beyond
the
tent
,
the
court
had
been
*NL*
transformed
into
a
wood
of
orange
trees
and
of
pink
laurels
in
full
*NL*
flower
.
As
they
had
been
careful
to
bury
the
vases
sufficiently
deep
,
*NL*
the
laurel
trees
and
the
orange
trees
appeared
to
come
straight
out
of
*NL*
the
ground
.
The
road
which
the
carriages
traversed
was
sanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
seemed
extraordinary
to
our
provincial
.
He
had
never
had
any
*NL*
idea
of
such
magnificence
.
In
a
single
instant
his
thrilled
imagination
*NL*
had
left
his
bad
temper
a
thousand
leagues
behind
.
In
the
carriage
on
*NL*
their
way
to
the
ball
Norbert
had
been
happy
,
while
he
saw
everything
*NL*
in
black
colours
.
They
had
scarcely
entered
the
courtyard
before
the
*NL*
roles
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Norbert
was
only
struck
by
a
few
details
which
,
in
the
midst
of
all
*NL*
that
magnificence
,
had
not
been
able
to
be
attended
to
.
He
calculated
*NL*
the
expense
of
each
item
,
and
Julien
remarked
that
the
nearer
he
got
*NL*
to
a
sum
total
,
the
more
jealous
and
bad-tempered
he
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
himself
,
he
was
fascinated
and
full
of
admiration
when
he
*NL*
reached
the
first
of
the
salons
where
they
were
dancing
.
His
emotion
*NL*
was
so
great
that
it
almost
made
him
nervous
.
There
was
a
crush
at
the
*NL*
door
of
the
second
salon
,
and
the
crowd
was
so
great
that
he
found
it
*NL*
impossible
to
advance
.
The
decorations
of
the
second
salon
presented
*NL*
the
Alhambra
of
Grenada
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
queen
of
the
ball
one
must
admit
,
''
said
a
young
man
with
a
*NL*
moustache
whose
shoulder
stuck
into
Julien
's
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Formant
who
has
been
the
prettiest
all
the
winter
,
*NL*
realises
that
she
will
have
to
go
down
to
the
second
place
.
See
how
*NL*
strange
she
looks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
truth
she
is
straining
every
nerve
to
please
.
Just
look
at
that
*NL*
gracious
smile
now
that
she
is
doing
the
figure
in
that
quadrille
all
*NL*
alone
.
On
my
honour
it
is
unique
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
looks
as
if
she
controlled
the
pleasure
which
*NL*
she
derives
from
her
triumph
,
of
which
she
is
perfectly
conscious
.
One
*NL*
might
say
that
she
fears
to
please
anyone
who
talks
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
.
That
is
the
art
of
alluring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
vainly
endeavoured
to
catch
sight
of
the
alluring
woman
.
Seven
*NL*
or
eight
men
who
were
taller
than
he
prevented
him
from
seeing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
quite
a
lot
of
coquetry
in
that
noble
reserve
,
''
said
the
*NL*
young
man
with
a
moustache
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
those
big
blue
eyes
,
which
are
lowered
so
slowly
when
one
would
*NL*
think
they
were
on
the
point
of
betraying
themselves
,
''
answered
his
*NL*
neighbour
.
``
On
my
faith
,
nothing
could
be
cleverer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
the
pretty
Formant
looking
quite
common
next
to
her
,
''
said
the
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
air
of
reserve
means
how
much
sweetness
would
I
spend
on
you
if
*NL*
you
were
the
man
who
was
worthy
of
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
could
be
worthy
of
the
sublime
Mathilde

said
the
first
man
.
*NL*
``
Some

*NL*
``

sovereign

,
or
quite
simply
the
comte
de

Thaler
,
who
looks
like
a
dressed-up
peasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
was
free
,
and
Julien
could
go
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
these
puppets
consider
her
so
remarkable
,
it
is
worth
while
*NL*
for
me
to
study
her
,
''
he
thought
.
``
I
shall
then
understand
what
these
*NL*
people
regard
as
perfection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
his
eyes
were
trying
to
find
her
,
Mathilde
looked
at
him
.
``
My
duty
*NL*
calls
me
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
But
it
was
only
his
expression
which
*NL*
was
bad-humoured
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
curiosity
made
him
advance
with
a
pleasure
which
the
extremely
low
*NL*
cut
dress
on
Mathilde
's
shoulder
very
quickly
accentuated
,
in
a
manner
*NL*
which
was
scarcely
flattering
for
his
own
self-respect
.
``
Her
beauty
has
*NL*
youth
,
''
he
thought
.
Five
or
six
people
,
whom
Julien
recognised
as
those
*NL*
who
had
been
speaking
at
the
door
were
between
her
and
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Monsieur
,
you
have
been
here
all
the
winter
,
''
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
``
Is
it
not
true
that
this
is
the
finest
ball
of
the
season
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
quadrille
of
Coulon
's
strikes
me
as
admirable
,
and
those
ladies
*NL*
dance
it
perfectly
.
''
The
young
men
turned
round
to
see
who
was
the
*NL*
happy
man
,
an
answer
from
whom
was
positively
insisted
on
.
The
answer
*NL*
was
not
encouraging
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
be
able
to
be
a
good
judge

magnificence

ever
seen

The
young

with
moustaches
were
scandalised

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
wise
man

came
the
answer
with
a
more

marked
interest
.

like
a
philosopher
,
like
J.
J.
Rousseau

All
these
follies
astonish
*NL*
without
alluring
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
imagination
had
just
hit
upon
an
epigram
which
banished
all
*NL*
illusions
from
his
mind
.
His
mouth
assumed
the
expression
of
a
perhaps
*NL*
slightly
exaggerated
disdain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
J.
J.
Rousseau
,
''
he
answered
,
``
is
in
my
view
only
a
fool
when
he
takes
*NL*
it
upon
himself
to
criticise
society
.
He
did
not
understand
it
,
and
*NL*
he
went
into
it
with
the
spirit
of
a
lackey
who
has
risen
above
his
*NL*
station
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wrote
the
_
Contrat
Social
_
,
''
answered
Mathilde
reverently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
he
preaches
the
Republic
,
and
the
overthrow
of
monarchical
*NL*
dignities
,
the
parvenu
was
intoxicated
with
happiness
if
a
duke
would
*NL*
go
out
of
his
way
after
dinner
to
one
of
his
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
the
Duke
of
Luxembourg
at
Montmorency
,
used
to
accompany
a
*NL*
Coindet
from
the
neighbourhood
of
Paris
,
''
went
on
Mademoiselle
de
*NL*
la
Mole
,
with
all
the
pleasure
and
enthusiasm
of
her
first
flush
of
*NL*
pedantry
.
She
was
intoxicated
with
her
knowledge
,
almost
like
the
*NL*
academician
who
discovered
the
existence
of
King
Feretrius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
look
was
still
penetrating
and
severe
.
Mathilde
had
had
*NL*
a
moment
's
enthusiasm
.
Her
partner
's
coldness
disconcerted
her
*NL*
profoundly
.
She
was
all
the
more
astonished
,
as
it
was
she
who
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
produce
that
particular
effect
on
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
was
advancing
eagerly
towards
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
He
was
for
a
moment
three
yards
away
from
her
.
*NL*
He
was
unable
to
get
closer
because
of
the
crowd
.
He
smiled
at
the
*NL*
obstacle
.
The
young
marquise
de
Rouvray
was
near
her
.
She
was
a
cousin
*NL*
of
Mathilde
.
She
was
giving
her
arm
to
her
husband
who
had
only
married
*NL*
her
a
fortnight
ago
.
The
marquis
de
Rouvray
,
who
was
also
very
young
,
*NL*
had
all
the
love
which
seizes
a
man
who
,
having
contracted
a
marriage
*NL*
of
convenience
exclusively
arranged
by
the
notaries
,
finds
a
person
who
*NL*
is
ideally
pretty
.
M.
de
Rouvray
would
be
a
duke
on
the
death
of
a
very
*NL*
old
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
was
struggling
to
get
through
the
*NL*
crowd
,
and
smiling
at
Mathilde
she
fixed
her
big
divinely
blue
eyes
*NL*
on
him
and
his
neighbours
.
``
Could
anything
be
flatter
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
.
``
There
is
Croisenois
who
wants
to
marry
me
,
he
is
gentle
and
*NL*
polite
,
he
has
perfect
manners
like
M.
de
Rouvray
.
If
they
did
not
*NL*
bore
,
those
gentlemen
would
be
quite
charming
.
He
too
,
would
accompany
*NL*
me
to
the
ball
with
that
smug
limited
expression
.
One
year
after
the
*NL*
marriage
I
shall
have
my
carriage
,
my
horses
,
my
dresses
,
my
chateau
*NL*
twenty
leagues
from
Paris
.
All
this
would
be
as
nice
as
possible
,
and
*NL*
enough
to
make
a
Countess
de
Roiville
,
for
example
,
die
of
envy
and
*NL*
afterwards
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
bored
herself
in
anticipation
.
The
marquis
de
Croisenois
*NL*
managed
to
approach
her
and
spoke
to
her
,
but
she
was
dreaming
and
*NL*
did
not
listen
to
him
.
The
noise
of
his
words
began
to
get
mixed
*NL*
with
the
buzz
of
the
ball
.
Her
eye
mechanically
followed
Julien
who
*NL*
had
gone
away
,
with
an
air
which
,
though
respectful
,
was
yet
proud
*NL*
and
discontented
.
She
noticed
in
a
corner
far
from
the
moving
crowd
,
*NL*
the
comte
Altamira
who
had
been
condemned
to
death
in
his
own
country
*NL*
and
whom
the
reader
knows
already
.
One
of
his
relatives
had
married
a
*NL*
Prince
de
Conti
in
the
reign
of
Louis
XIV
.
This
historical
fact
was
*NL*
some
protection
against
the
police
of
the
congregation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
being
condemned
to
death
is
the
only
real
distinction
,
''
said
*NL*
Mathilde
.
``
It
is
the
only
thing
which
can
not
be
bought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
's
an
epigram
,
I
just
said
,
what
a
pity
it
did
not
come
at
a
*NL*
moment
when
I
could
have
reaped
all
the
credit
for
it
.
''
Mathilde
had
*NL*
too
much
taste
to
work
into
the
conversation
a
prepared
epigram
but
*NL*
at
the
same
time
she
was
too
vain
not
to
be
extremely
pleased
with
*NL*
herself
.
A
happy
expression
succeeded
the
palpable
boredom
of
her
face
.
*NL*
The
marquis
de
Croisenois
,
who
had
never
left
off
talking
,
saw
a
chance
*NL*
of
success
and
waxed
twice
as
eloquent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
objection
could
a
caviller
find
with
my
epigram
,
''
said
Mathilde
*NL*
to
herself
.
``
I
would
answer
my
critic
in
this
way
:
The
title
of
baron
*NL*
or
vicomte
is
to
be
bought
;
a
cross
,
why
it
is
a
gift
.
My
brother
*NL*
has
just
got
one
.
What
has
he
done
?
A
promotion
,
why
that
can
be
*NL*
obtained
by
being
ten
years
in
a
garrison
or
have
the
minister
of
war
*NL*
for
a
relative
,
and
you
'll
be
a
chief
of
a
squadron
like
Norbert
.
A
*NL*
great
fortune
!
That
's
rather
more
difficult
,
and
consequently
more
*NL*
meritorious
.
It
is
really
quite
funny
.
It
's
the
opposite
of
what
*NL*
the
books
say
.
Well
,
to
win
a
fortune
why
you
marry
M.
Rothschild
's
*NL*
daughter
.
Really
my
epigram
is
quite
deep
.
Being
condemned
to
death
is
*NL*
still
the
one
privilege
which
one
has
never
thought
of
canvassing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
the
comte
Altamira
,
''
she
said
to
M.
de
Croisenois
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
thoughts
seemed
to
have
been
so
far
away
,
and
this
question
had
*NL*
so
little
connection
with
all
that
the
poor
marquis
had
been
saying
*NL*
for
the
last
five
minutes
,
that
his
good
temper
was
ruffled
.
He
was
*NL*
nevertheless
a
man
of
wit
and
celebrated
for
being
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mathilde
is
eccentric
,
''
he
thought
,
``
that
's
a
nuisance
,
but
she
will
*NL*
give
her
husband
such
a
fine
social
position
.
I
do
n't
know
how
the
*NL*
marquis
de
la
Mole
manages
.
He
is
connected
with
all
that
is
best
in
*NL*
all
parties
.
He
is
a
man
who
is
bound
to
come
out
on
top
.
And
,
besides
,
*NL*
this
eccentricity
of
Mathilde
's
may
pass
for
genius
.
Genius
when
allied
*NL*
with
good
birth
and
a
large
fortune
,
so
far
from
being
ridiculous
,
is
*NL*
highly
distinguished
.
She
has
wit
,
moreover
,
when
she
wants
to
,
that
*NL*
mixture
in
fact
of
brains
,
character
,
and
ready
wit
which
constitute
*NL*
perfection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
is
difficult
to
do
two
things
at
the
same
time
,
the
marquis
*NL*
answered
Mathilde
with
a
vacant
expression
as
though
he
were
reciting
a
*NL*
lesson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
does
not
know
that
poor
Altamira
?
''
and
he
told
her
the
history
of
*NL*
his
conspiracy
,
abortive
,
ridiculous
and
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
absurd
,
''
said
Mathilde
as
if
she
were
talking
to
herself
,
``
but
he
*NL*
has
done
something
.
I
want
to
see
a
man
;
bring
him
to
me
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
the
scandalized
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Comte
Altamira
was
one
of
the
most
avowed
admirers
of
mademoiselle
de
*NL*
la
Mole
's
haughty
and
impertinent
manner
.
In
his
opinion
she
was
one
of
*NL*
the
most
beautiful
persons
in
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fine
she
would
be
on
a
throne
,
''
he
said
to
M.
de
Croisenois
;
and
*NL*
made
no
demur
at
being
taken
up
to
Mathilde
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
a
good
number
of
people
in
society
who
would
like
to
*NL*
establish
the
fact
that
nothing
is
in
such
bad
form
as
a
conspiracy
,
in
*NL*
the
nineteenth
century
;
it
smacks
of
Jacobinism
.
And
what
could
be
more
*NL*
sordid
than
unsuccessful
Jacobinism
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
's
expression
made
fun
a
little
of
Altamira
and
M.
de
*NL*
Croisenois
,
but
she
listened
to
him
with
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
conspirator
at
a
ball
,
what
a
pretty
contrast
,
''
she
thought
.
She
*NL*
thought
that
this
man
with
his
black
moustache
looked
like
a
lion
at
*NL*
rest
,
but
she
soon
perceived
that
his
mind
had
only
one
point
of
view
:
*NL*
_
utility
,
admiration
for
utility
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
comte
thought
nothing
worthy
his
attention
except
what
tended
*NL*
to
give
his
country
two
chamber
government
.
He
left
Mathilde
,
who
was
*NL*
the
prettiest
person
at
the
ball
,
with
alacrity
,
because
he
saw
a
*NL*
Peruvian
general
come
in
.
Desparing
of
Europe
such
as
M.
de
Metternich
*NL*
had
arranged
it
,
poor
Altamira
had
been
reduced
to
thinking
that
when
*NL*
the
States
of
South
America
had
become
strong
and
powerful
they
could
*NL*
restore
to
Europe
the
liberty
which
Mirabeau
has
given
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
crowd
of
moustachised
young
men
had
approached
Mathilde
.
She
realized
*NL*
that
Altamira
had
not
felt
allured
,
and
was
piqued
by
his
departure
.
*NL*
She
saw
his
black
eye
gleam
as
he
talked
to
the
Peruvian
general
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
looked
at
the
young
Frenchmen
with
that
*NL*
profound
seriousness
which
none
of
her
rivals
could
imitate
,
``
which
*NL*
of
them
,
''
she
thought
,
``
could
get
himself
condemned
to
death
,
even
*NL*
supposing
he
had
a
favourable
opportunity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
singular
look
flattered
those
who
were
not
very
intelligent
,
but
*NL*
disconcerted
the
others
.
They
feared
the
discharge
of
some
stinging
*NL*
epigram
that
would
be
difficult
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
birth
vouchsafes
a
hundred
qualities
whose
absence
would
offend
*NL*
me
.
I
see
as
much
in
the
case
of
Julien
,
''
thought
Mathilde
,
``
but
it
*NL*
withers
up
those
qualities
of
soul
which
make
a
man
get
condemned
to
*NL*
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
some
one
was
saying
near
her
:
``
Comte
Altamira
is
the
*NL*
second
son
of
the
Prince
of
San
Nazaro-Pimentel
;
it
was
a
Pimentel
who
*NL*
tried
to
save
Conradin
,
was
beheaded
in
1268
.
It
is
one
of
the
noblest
*NL*
families
in
Naples
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
said
Mathilde
to
herself
,
``
what
a
pretty
proof
this
is
of
my
*NL*
maxim
,
that
good
birth
deprives
a
man
of
that
force
of
character
*NL*
in
default
of
which
a
man
does
not
get
condemned
to
death
.
I
seem
*NL*
doomed
to
reason
falsely
to-night
.
Since
I
am
only
a
woman
like
any
*NL*
other
,
well
I
must
dance
.
''
She
yielded
to
the
solicitations
of
M.
de
*NL*
Croisenois
who
had
been
asking
for
a
gallop
for
the
last
hour
.
To
*NL*
distract
herself
from
her
failure
in
philosophy
,
Mathilde
made
a
point
*NL*
of
being
perfectly
fascinating
.
M.
de
Croisenois
was
enchanted
.
But
*NL*
neither
the
dance
nor
her
wish
to
please
one
of
the
handsomest
men
at
*NL*
court
,
nor
anything
at
all
,
succeeded
in
distracting
Mathilde
.
She
*NL*
could
not
possibly
have
been
more
of
a
success
.
She
was
the
queen
of
*NL*
the
ball
.
She
coldly
appreciated
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
blank
life
I
shall
pass
with
a
person
like
Croisenois
,
''
she
*NL*
said
to
herself
as
he
took
her
back
to
her
place
an
hour
afterwards
.
*NL*
``
What
pleasure
do
I
get
,
''
she
added
sadly
,
``
if
after
an
absence
of
*NL*
six
months
I
find
myself
at
a
ball
which
all
the
women
of
Paris
were
*NL*
mad
with
jealousy
to
go
to
?
And
what
is
more
I
am
surrounded
by
the
*NL*
homage
of
an
ideally
constituted
circle
of
society
.
The
only
bourgeois
*NL*
are
some
peers
and
perhaps
one
or
two
Juliens
.
And
yet
,
''
she
added
*NL*
with
increasing
sadness
,
``
what
advantages
has
not
fate
bestowed
upon
*NL*
me
!
Distinction
,
fortune
,
youth
,
everything
except
happiness
.
My
most
*NL*
dubious
advantages
are
the
very
ones
they
have
been
speaking
to
me
*NL*
about
all
the
evening
.
Wit
,
I
believe
I
have
it
,
because
I
obviously
*NL*
frighten
everyone
.
If
they
venture
to
tackle
a
serious
subject
,
they
*NL*
will
arrive
after
five
minutes
of
conversation
and
as
though
they
had
*NL*
made
a
great
discovery
at
a
conclusion
which
we
have
been
repeating
to
*NL*
them
for
the
last
hour
.
I
am
beautiful
,
I
have
that
advantage
for
which
*NL*
madame
de
Stael
would
have
sacrificed
everything
,
and
yet
I
'm
dying
of
*NL*
boredom
.
Shall
I
have
reason
to
be
less
bored
when
I
have
changed
my
*NL*
name
for
that
of
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
though
,
''
she
added
,
while
she
almost
felt
as
if
she
would
like
*NL*
to
cry
,
``
is
n't
he
really
quite
perfect
?
He
's
a
paragon
of
the
education
*NL*
of
the
age
;
you
ca
n't
look
at
him
without
his
finding
something
*NL*
charming
and
even
witty
to
say
to
you
;
he
is
brave
.
But
that
Sorel
is
*NL*
strange
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
and
the
expression
of
her
eyes
changed
*NL*
from
melancholy
to
anger
.
``
I
told
him
that
I
had
something
to
say
to
*NL*
him
and
he
has
n't
deigned
to
reappear

CHAPTER
XXXIX
*NL*
*NL*
THE
BALL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
luxurious
dresses
,
the
glitter
of
the
candles
;
all
*NL*
those
pretty
arms
and
fine
shoulders
;
the
bouquets
,
*NL*
the
intoxicating
strains
of
Rossini
,
the
paintings
of
*NL*
Ciceri
.
I

``
You
are
in
a
bad
temper
,
''
said
the
marquise
de
la
Mole
to
her
;
``
let
me
*NL*
caution
you
,
it
is
ungracious
at
a
ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
have
a
headache
,
''
answered
Mathilde
disdainfully
,
``
it
is
too
*NL*
hot
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
old
Baron
Tolly
became
ill
and
fell
down
,
as
though
*NL*
to
justify
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
remark
.
They
were
obliged
to
carry
*NL*
him
away
.
They
talked
about
apoplexy
.
It
was
a
disagreeable
incident
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
did
not
bother
much
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
a
point
of
never
looking
at
old
men
,
or
at
anyone
who
had
the
*NL*
reputation
of
being
bad
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
danced
in
order
to
escape
the
conversation
about
the
apoplexy
,
*NL*
which
was
not
apoplexy
inasmuch
as
the
baron
put
in
an
appearance
the
*NL*
following
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Sorel
does
not
come
,
''
she
said
to
herself
after
she
had
danced
.
*NL*
She
was
almost
looking
round
for
him
when
she
found
him
in
another
*NL*
salon
.
Astonishing
,
but
he
seemed
to
have
lost
that
impassive
coldness
*NL*
that
was
so
natural
to
him
;
he
no
longer
looked
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
talking
to
comte
Altamira
who
was
sentenced
to
death
,
''
said
*NL*
Mathilde
to
herself
.
``
His
eye
is
full
of
a
sombre
fire
;
he
looks
like
a
*NL*
prince
in
disguise
;
his
haughtiness
has
become
twice
as
pronounced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
came
back
to
where
she
was
,
still
talking
to
Altamira
.
She
*NL*
looked
at
Altamira
fixedly
,
studying
his
features
in
order
to
trace
*NL*
those
lofty
qualities
which
can
earn
a
man
the
honour
of
being
*NL*
condemned
to
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
was
saying
to
comte
Altamira
as
he
passed
by
her
,
``
Danton
was
*NL*
a
real
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heavens
can
he
be
a
Danton
?
''
said
Mathilde
to
herself
,
``
but
he
has
*NL*
so
noble
a
face
,
and
that
Danton
was
so
horribly
ugly
,
a
butcher
I
*NL*
believe
.
''
Julien
was
still
fairly
near
her
.
She
did
not
hesitate
to
*NL*
call
him
;
she
had
the
consciousness
and
the
pride
of
putting
a
question
*NL*
that
was
unusual
for
a
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
not
Danton
a
butcher
?
''
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
in
the
eyes
of
certain
persons
,
''
Julien
answered
her
with
the
*NL*
most
thinly
disguised
expression
of
contempt
.
His
eyes
were
still
*NL*
ardent
from
his
conversation
with
Altamira
,
``
but
unfortunately
for
*NL*
the
people
of
good
birth
he
was
an
advocate
at
Mery-sur-Seine
,
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
mademoiselle
,
''
he
added
maliciously
,
``
he
began
like
many
*NL*
peers
whom
I
see
here
.
It
was
true
that
Danton
laboured
under
a
great
*NL*
disadvantage
in
the
eyes
of
beauty
;
he
was
ugly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
last
few
words
were
spoken
rapidly
in
an
extraordinary
and
indeed
*NL*
very
discourteous
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
waited
for
a
moment
,
leaning
slightly
forward
and
with
an
air
of
*NL*
proud
humility
.
He
seemed
to
be
saying
,
``
I
am
paid
to
answer
you
and
I
*NL*
live
on
my
pay
.
''
He
did
not
deign
to
look
up
at
Mathilde
.
She
looked
*NL*
like
his
slave
with
her
fine
eyes
open
abnormally
wide
and
fixed
on
*NL*
him
.
Finally
as
the
silence
continued
he
looked
at
her
,
like
a
valet
*NL*
looking
at
his
master
to
receive
orders
.
Although
his
eyes
met
the
full
*NL*
gaze
of
Mathilde
which
were
fixed
on
him
all
the
time
with
a
strange
*NL*
expression
,
he
went
away
with
a
marked
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
of
a
man
who
is
as
handsome
as
he
is
,
''
said
Mathilde
to
*NL*
herself
as
she
emerged
from
her
reverie
,
``
praising
ugliness
in
such
a
*NL*
way
,
he
is
not
like
Caylus
or
Croisenois
.
This
Sorel
has
something
like
*NL*
my
father
's
look
when
he
goes
to
a
fancy
dress
ball
as
Napoleon
.
''
She
*NL*
had
completely
forgotten
Danton
.
``
Yes
,
I
am
decidedly
bored
to-night
.
''
*NL*
She
took
her
brother
's
arm
and
to
his
great
disgust
made
him
take
*NL*
her
round
the
ball-room
.
The
idea
occurred
to
her
of
following
the
*NL*
conversation
between
Julien
and
the
man
who
had
been
condemned
to
*NL*
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
was
enormous
.
She
managed
to
find
them
,
however
,
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
two
yards
in
front
of
her
Altamira
was
going
near
a
*NL*
dumb-waiter
to
take
an
ice
.
He
was
talking
to
Julien
with
his
body
half
*NL*
turned
round
.
He
saw
an
arm
in
an
embroidered
coat
which
was
taking
an
*NL*
ice
close
by
.
The
embroidery
seemed
to
attract
his
attention
.
He
turned
*NL*
round
to
look
at
the
person
to
whom
the
arm
belonged
.
His
noble
and
yet
*NL*
simple
eyes
immediately
assumed
a
slightly
disdainful
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
that
man
,
''
he
said
to
Julien
in
a
low
voice
;
``
that
is
the
*NL*
Prince
of
Araceli
Ambassador
of
--
.
He
asked
M.
de
Nerval
,
your
*NL*
Minister
for
Foreign
Affairs
,
for
my
extradition
this
morning
.
See
,
*NL*
there
he
is
over
there
playing
whist
.
Monsieur
de
Nerval
is
willing
*NL*
enough
to
give
me
up
,
for
we
gave
up
two
or
three
conspirators
to
you
*NL*
in
1816
.
If
I
am
given
up
to
my
king
I
shall
be
hanged
in
twenty-four
*NL*
hours
.
It
will
be
one
of
those
handsome
moustachioed
gentlemen
who
will
*NL*
arrest
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wretches
!
''
exclaimed
Julien
half
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
did
not
lose
a
syllable
of
their
conversation
.
Her
ennui
had
*NL*
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
not
scoundrels
,
''
replied
Count
Altamira
.
``
I
talk
to
you
about
*NL*
myself
in
order
to
give
you
a
vivid
impression
.
Look
at
the
Prince
of
*NL*
Araceli
.
He
casts
his
eyes
on
his
golden
fleece
every
five
minutes
;
he
*NL*
can
not
get
over
the
pleasure
of
seeing
that
decoration
on
his
breast
.
*NL*
In
reality
the
poor
man
is
really
an
anachronism
.
The
fleece
was
a
*NL*
signal
honour
a
hundred
years
ago
,
but
he
would
have
been
nowhere
*NL*
near
it
in
those
days
.
But
nowadays
,
so
far
as
people
of
birth
are
*NL*
concerned
,
you
have
to
be
an
Araceli
to
be
delighted
with
it
.
He
had
a
*NL*
whole
town
hanged
in
order
to
get
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
the
price
he
had
to
pay
?
''
said
Julien
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
exactly
,
''
answered
Altamira
coldly
,
``
he
probably
had
about
thirty
*NL*
rich
landed
proprietors
in
his
district
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
*NL*
Liberals
thrown
into
the
river
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
monster
!
''
pursued
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
who
was
leaning
her
head
forward
with
keenest
*NL*
interest
was
so
near
him
that
her
beautiful
hair
almost
touched
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
young
,
''
answered
Altamira
.
``
I
was
telling
you
that
I
had
*NL*
a
married
sister
in
Provence
.
She
is
still
pretty
,
good
and
gentle
;
she
*NL*
is
an
excellent
mother
,
performs
all
her
duties
faithfully
,
is
pious
*NL*
but
not
a
bigot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
he
driving
at
?
''
thought
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
happy
,
''
continued
the
comte
Altamira
;
``
she
was
so
in
1815
.
I
*NL*
was
then
in
hiding
at
her
house
on
her
estate
near
the
Antibes
.
Well
*NL*
the
moment
she
learnt
of
marshall
Ney
's
execution
she
began
to
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
?
''
said
Julien
,
thunderstruck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
party
spirit
,
''
replied
Altamira
.
``
There
are
no
longer
any
real
*NL*
passions
in
the
nineteenth
century
:
that
's
why
one
is
so
bored
in
*NL*
France
.
People
commit
acts
of
the
greatest
cruelty
,
but
without
any
*NL*
feeling
of
cruelty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
worse
,
''
said
Julien
,
``
when
one
does
commit
a
crime
one
*NL*
ought
at
least
to
take
pleasure
in
committing
it
;
that
's
the
only
good
*NL*
thing
they
have
about
them
and
that
's
the
only
way
in
which
they
have
*NL*
the
slightest
justification
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
had
entirely
forgotten
what
she
owed
to
herself
*NL*
and
placed
herself
completely
between
Altamira
and
Julien
.
Her
brother
,
*NL*
who
was
giving
her
his
arm
,
and
was
accustomed
to
obey
her
,
was
*NL*
looking
at
another
part
of
the
room
,
and
in
order
to
keep
himself
in
*NL*
countenance
was
pretending
to
be
stopped
by
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
Altamira
went
on
,
``
one
takes
pleasure
in
nothing
one
*NL*
does
,
and
one
does
not
remember
it
:
this
applies
even
to
crimes
.
I
can
*NL*
show
you
perhaps
ten
men
in
this
ballroom
who
have
been
convicted
of
*NL*
murder
.
They
have
forgotten
all
about
it
and
everybody
else
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
are
moved
to
the
point
of
tears
if
their
dog
breaks
a
paw
.
*NL*
When
you
throw
flowers
on
their
grave
at
Pere-la-Chaise
,
as
you
say
*NL*
so
humorously
in
Paris
,
we
learn
they
united
all
the
virtues
of
the
*NL*
knights
of
chivalry
,
and
we
speak
about
the
noble
feats
of
their
*NL*
great-grandfather
who
lived
in
the
reign
of
Henri
IV
.
If
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
good
offices
of
the
Prince
de
Araceli
,
I
escape
hanging
and
I
ever
*NL*
manage
to
enjoy
the
use
of
my
money
in
Paris
,
I
will
get
you
to
dine
*NL*
with
eight
or
ten
of
these
respected
and
callous
murderers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
that
dinner
you
and
I
will
be
the
only
ones
whose
blood
is
pure
,
*NL*
but
I
shall
be
despised
and
almost
hated
as
a
monster
,
while
you
will
*NL*
be
simply
despised
as
a
man
of
the
people
who
has
pushed
his
way
into
*NL*
good
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
could
be
truer
,
''
said
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Altamira
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
;
but
Julien
did
not
deign
to
*NL*
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Observe
that
the
revolution
,
at
whose
head
I
found
myself
,
''
continued
*NL*
the
comte
Altamira
,
``
only
failed
for
the
one
reason
that
I
would
not
*NL*
cut
off
three
heads
and
distribute
among
our
partisans
seven
or
eight
*NL*
millions
which
happened
to
be
in
a
box
of
which
I
happened
to
have
the
*NL*
key
.
My
king
,
who
is
burning
to
have
me
hanged
to-day
,
and
who
called
*NL*
me
by
my
christian
name
before
the
rebellion
,
would
have
given
me
the
*NL*
great
ribbon
of
his
order
if
I
had
had
those
three
heads
cut
off
and
*NL*
had
had
the
money
in
those
boxes
distributed
;
for
I
should
have
had
at
*NL*
least
a
semi-success
and
my
country
would
have
had
a
charta
like
--
.
*NL*
So
wags
the
world
;
it
's
a
game
of
chess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
that
time
,
''
answered
Julien
with
a
fiery
eye
,
``
you
did
not
know
the
*NL*
game
;
now
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
I
would
have
the
heads
cut
off
,
and
I
would
not
be
a
*NL*
Girondin
,
as
you
said
I
was
the
other
day
?
I
will
give
you
your
*NL*
answer
,
''
said
Altamira
sadly
,
``
when
you
have
killed
a
man
in
a
duel
--
a
*NL*
far
less
ugly
matter
than
having
him
put
to
death
by
an
executioner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
said
Julien
,
``
the
end
justifies
the
means
.
If
instead
*NL*
of
being
an
insignificant
man
I
had
some
power
I
would
have
three
men
*NL*
hanged
in
order
to
save
four
men
's
lives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
expressed
the
fire
of
his
own
conscience
;
they
met
the
eyes
of
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
who
was
close
by
him
,
and
their
contempt
,
so
*NL*
far
from
changing
into
politeness
seemed
to
redouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
deeply
shocked
;
but
she
found
herself
unable
to
forget
Julien
;
*NL*
she
dragged
her
brother
away
and
went
off
in
a
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
take
some
punch
and
dance
a
lot
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
I
will
*NL*
pick
out
the
best
partner
and
cut
some
figure
at
any
price
.
Good
,
there
*NL*
is
that
celebrated
cynic
,
the
comte
de
Fervaques
.
''
She
accepted
his
*NL*
invitation
;
they
danced
.
``
The
question
is
,
''
she
thought
,
``
which
of
us
*NL*
two
will
be
the
more
impertinent
,
but
in
order
to
make
absolute
fun
*NL*
of
him
,
I
must
get
him
to
talk
.
''
Soon
all
the
other
members
of
the
*NL*
quadrille
were
dancing
as
a
matter
of
formality
,
they
did
not
want
to
*NL*
lose
any
of
Mathilde
's
cutting
reparte
.
M.
de
Fervaques
felt
uneasy
and
*NL*
as
he
could
only
find
elegant
expressions
instead
of
ideas
,
began
to
*NL*
scowl
.
Mathilde
,
who
was
in
a
bad
temper
was
cruel
,
and
made
an
enemy
*NL*
of
him
.
She
danced
till
daylight
and
then
went
home
terribly
tired
.
*NL*
But
when
she
was
in
the
carriage
the
little
vitality
she
had
left
,
was
*NL*
still
employed
in
making
her
sad
and
unhappy
.
She
had
been
despised
by
*NL*
Julien
and
could
not
despise
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
at
the
zenith
of
his
happiness

He
was
enchanted
without
*NL*
his
knowing
it
by
the
music
,
the
flowers
,
the
pretty
women
,
the
*NL*
general
elegance
,
and
above
all
by
his
own
imagination
which
dreamt
of
*NL*
distinctions
for
himself
and
of
liberty
for
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fine
ball
,
''
he
said
to
the
comte
.
``
Nothing
is
lacking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thought
is
lacking
''
answered
Altamira
,
and
his
face
betrayed
that
*NL*
contempt
which
is
only
more
deadly
from
the
very
fact
that
a
manifest
*NL*
effort
is
being
made
to
hide
it
as
a
matter
of
politeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
monsieur
the
comte
,
there
is
n't
any
thought
at
all

let
*NL*
alone
enough
to
make
a
conspiracy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
here
because
of
my
name

but
thought
is
hated
in
your
salons

*NL*
Thought
must
not
soar
above
the
level
of
the
point
of
a
Vaudeville
*NL*
couplet
:
it
is
then
rewarded
.
But
as
for
your
man
who
thinks
,
if
he
*NL*
shows
energy
and
originality
we
call
him
a
cynic

Was
not
that
name
*NL*
given
by
one
of
your
judges
to
Courier

You
put
him
in
prison
as

hands
over
to
the

everyone

is

anything

*NL*

The
fact
is
your
effete

conventionalism

everything
else

You
will
never
get
beyond
military
bravery

You
will
*NL*
have
Murats
,
never
Washingtons

I
can
see
nothing
in
France
except
*NL*
vanity
.
A
man
who
goes
on
speaking
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
may
easily
*NL*
come
to
make
an
imprudent
witticism
and
the
master
of
the
house
thinks
*NL*
himself
insulted

*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
saying
this
,
the
carriage
in
which
the
comte
was
seeing
*NL*
Julien
home
stopped
before
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
.
Julien
was
in
love
*NL*
with
his
conspirator
.
Altamira
had
paid
him
this
great
compliment
which
*NL*
was
evidently
the
expression
of
a
sound
conviction
.
``
You
have
not
got
*NL*
the
French
flippancy
and
you
understand
the
principle
of
_
utility
_
.
''
*NL*
It
happened
that
Julien
had
seen
the
day
before
_
Marino
Faliero
_
,
a
*NL*
tragedy
,
by
Casmir
Delavigne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
not
Israel
Bertuccio
got
more
character
than
all
those
noble
*NL*
Venetians

''
said
our
rebellious
plebeian
to
himself
,
``
and
yet
those
*NL*
are
the
people
whose
nobility
goes
back
to
the
year
seven
hundred

a

century
before
Charlemagne
,
while
the
cream
of
the
nobility
at
M.
de
*NL*
Ritz
's
ball
to-night
only
goes
back
,
and
that
rather
lamely
,
to
the
*NL*
thirteenth
century
.
Well
,
in
spite
of
all
the
noble
Venetians
whose
*NL*
birth
makes
so
great
,
it
is
Israel
Bertuccio
whom
one
remembers
.

*NL*
``
A

There

man
takes
for
his
crest
the
rank
that
is
given
him
by
the
way
*NL*
in
which
he
faces
death
.
The
intellect
itself
loses
some
of
its
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
Danton
have
been
to-day
in
this
age
of
the
Valenods
and
the
*NL*
Renals
?
Not
even
a
deputy
for
the
Public
Prosecutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
saying
?
He
would
have
sold
himself
to

he

,
for
after
all
the

Danton
did
steal

*NL*
Mirabeau
also
sold

Napoleon

Ought
one
to

,
*NL*
ought
one
to
sell
oneself
?
''
thought
Julien
.
This
question
pulled
him
up
*NL*
short
.
He
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
in
reading
the
history
of
the
*NL*
revolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
wrote
his
letters
in
the
library
the
following
day
,
his
mind
*NL*
was
still
concentrated
on
his
conversation
with
count
Altamira
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
''
he
said
to
himself
after
a
long
reverie
,
``
If
the
*NL*
Spanish
Liberals
had
not
injured
their
nation
by
crimes
they
would
not
*NL*
have
been
cleared
out
as
easily
as
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
haughty
,
talkative
children
--
just
like
I
am
!
''
he
suddenly
*NL*
exclaimed
as
though
waking
up
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
difficulty
have
I
surmounted
that
entitles
me
to
judge
such
*NL*
devils
who

once
alive
,
dared
to
begin
to
act
.
I
am
like
a
man
who
*NL*
exclaims
at
the
close
of
a
meal
,
'
I
wo
n't
dine
to-morrow
;
but
that
*NL*
wo
n't
prevent
me
from
feeling
as
strong
and
merry
like
I
do
to-day
.
'
*NL*
Who
knows
what
one
feels
when
one
is
half-way
through
a
great
action
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
lofty
thoughts
were
disturbed
by
the
unexpected
arrival
in
*NL*
the
library
of
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
He
was
so
animated
by
his
*NL*
admiration
for
the
great
qualities
of
such
invincibles
as
Danton
,
*NL*
Mirabeau
,
and
Carnot
that
,
though
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
mademoiselle
de
*NL*
la
Mole
,
he
neither
gave
her
a
thought
nor
bowed
to
her
,
and
scarcely
*NL*
even
saw
her
.
When
finally
his
big
,
open
eyes
realized
her
presence
,
*NL*
their
expression
vanished
.
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
noticed
it
with
*NL*
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
she
asked
him
for
Vely
's
History
of
France
which
*NL*
was
on
the
highest
shelf
,
and
thus
necessitated
Julien
going
to
fetch
*NL*
the
longer
of
the
two
ladders
.
Julien
had
brought
the
ladder
and
had
*NL*
fetched
the
volume
and
given
it
to
her
,
but
had
not
yet
been
able
to
*NL*
give
her
a
single
thought
.
As
he
was
taking
the
ladder
back
he
hit
*NL*
in
his
hurry
one
of
the
glass
panes
in
the
library
with
his
elbow
;
*NL*
the
noise
of
the
glass
falling
on
the
floor
finally
brought
him
to
*NL*
himself
.
He
hastened
to
apologise
to
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
He
tried
*NL*
to
be
polite
and
was
certainly
nothing
more
.
Mathilde
saw
clearly
that
*NL*
she
had
disturbed
him
,
and
that
he
would
have
preferred
to
have
gone
*NL*
on
thinking
about
what
he
had
been
engrossed
in
before
her
arrival
,
*NL*
to
speaking
to
her
.
After
looking
at
him
for
some
time
she
went
*NL*
slowly
away
.
Julien
watched
her
walk
.
He
enjoyed
the
contrast
of
her
*NL*
present
dress
with
the
elegant
magnificence
of
the
previous
night
.
The
*NL*
difference
between
the
two
expressions
was
equally
striking
.
The
young
*NL*
girl
who
had
been
so
haughty
at
the
Duke
de
Retz
's
ball
,
had
,
at
the
*NL*
present
moment
,
an
almost
plaintive
expression
.
``
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
''
*NL*
said
Julien
to
himself
,
``
that
black
dress
makes
the
beauty
of
her
*NL*
figure
all
the
more
striking
.
She
has
a
queenly
carriage
;
but
why
is
*NL*
she
in
mourning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
ask
someone
the
reason
for
this
mourning
,
they
will
think
I
am
*NL*
putting
my
foot
in
it
again
.
''
Julien
had
now
quite
emerged
from
the
*NL*
depth
of
his
enthusiasm
.
``
I
must
read
over
again
all
the
letters
I
have
*NL*
written
this
morning
.
God
knows
how
many
missed
out
words
and
blunders
*NL*
I
shall
find
.
As
he
was
forcing
himself
to
concentrate
his
mind
on
the
*NL*
first
of
these
letters
he
heard
the
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
near
him
.
*NL*
He
suddenly
turned
round
,
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
was
two
yards
from
*NL*
his
table
,
she
was
smiling
.
This
second
interruption
put
Julien
into
a
*NL*
bad
temper
.
Mathilde
had
just
fully
realized
that
she
meant
nothing
to
*NL*
this
young
man
.
Her
smile
was
intended
to
hide
her
embarrassment
;
she
*NL*
succeeded
in
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
evidently
thinking
of
something
very
interesting
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Sorel
.
Is
it
not
some
curious
anecdote
about
that
conspiracy
which
*NL*
is
responsible
for
comte
Altamira
being
in
Paris
?
Tell
me
what
it
is
*NL*
about
,
I
am
burning
to
know
.
I
will
be
discreet
,
I
swear
it
.
''
She
was
*NL*
astonished
at
hearing
herself
utter
these
words
.
What
!
was
she
asking
a
*NL*
favour
of
an
inferior
!
Her
embarrassment
increased
,
and
she
added
with
*NL*
a
little
touch
of
flippancy
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
managed
to
turn
such
a
usually
cold
person
as
yourself
,
into
*NL*
an
inspired
being
,
a
kind
of
Michael
Angelo
prophet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
sharp
and
indiscreet
question
wounded
Julien
deeply
,
and
rendered
*NL*
him
madder
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
Danton
right
in
stealing
?
''
he
said
to
her
brusquely
in
a
manner
*NL*
that
grew
more
and
more
surly
.
``
Ought
the
revolutionaries
of
Piedmont
*NL*
and
of
Spain
to
have
injured
the
people
by
crimes
?
To
have
given
all
*NL*
the
places
in
the
army
and
all
the
orders
to
undeserving
persons
?
Would
*NL*
not
the
persons
who
wore
these
orders
have
feared
the
return
of
the
*NL*
king
?
Ought
they
to
have
allowed
the
treasure
of
Turin
to
be
looted
?
*NL*
In
a
word
,
mademoiselle
,
''
he
said
,
coming
near
her
with
a
terrifying
*NL*
expression
,
``
ought
the
man
who
wishes
to
chase
ignorance
and
crime
from
*NL*
the
world
to
pass
like
the
whirlwind
and
do
evil
indiscriminately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
felt
frightened
,
was
unable
to
stand
his
look
,
and
retreated
a
*NL*
couples
of
paces
.
She
looked
at
him
a
moment
,
and
then
ashamed
of
her
*NL*
own
fear
,
left
the
library
with
a
light
step
.

Julien
reread
his

``
How
ridiculous
I
must
have
appeared
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
that
Parisian
doll
,
''
he
said
to
himself
when
the
dinner-bell
*NL*
rang
.
``
How
foolish
to
have
really
told
her
what
I
was
thinking
!
Perhaps
*NL*
it
was
not
so
foolish
.
Telling
the
truth
on
that
occasion
was
worthy
of
*NL*
me
.
Why
did
she
come
to
question
me
on
personal
matters
?
That
question
*NL*
was
indiscreet
on
her
part
.
She
broke
the
convention
.
My
thoughts
about
*NL*
Danton
are
not
part
of
the
sacrifice
which
her
father
pays
me
to
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
into
the
dining-room
Julien
's
thoughts
were
distracted
*NL*
from
his
bad
temper
by
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
mourning
which
was
all
*NL*
the
more
striking
because
none
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
were
*NL*
in
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
he
felt
completely
rid
of
the
feeling
which
had
obsessed
*NL*
him
all
day
.
Fortunately
the
academician
who
knew
Latin
was
at
dinner
.
*NL*
``
That
's
the
man
who
will
make
the
least
fun
of
me
,
''
said
Julien
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
if
,
as
I
surmise
,
my
question
about
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
*NL*
mourning
is
in
bad
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
was
looking
at
him
with
a
singular
expression
.
``
So
this
is
the
*NL*
coquetry
of
the
women
of
this
part
of
the
country
,
just
as
madame
de
*NL*
Renal
described
it
to
me
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
``
I
was
not
nice
to
*NL*
her
this
morning
.
I
did
not
humour
her
caprice
of
talking
to
me
.
I
got
*NL*
up
in
value
in
her
eyes
.
The
Devil
doubtless
is
no
loser
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Later
on
her
haughty
disdain

manage
to
revenge
herself

I
defy
*NL*
her
to
do
her
worst
.
What
a
contrast
with
what
I
have
lost
!
What
*NL*
charming
naturalness
?
What
naivety
!
I
used
to
know
her
thoughts
before
*NL*
she
did
herself
.
I
used
to
see
them
come
into
existence
.
The
only
rival
*NL*
she
had
in
her
heart
was
the
fear
of
her
childrens
'
death
.
It
was
a
*NL*
reasonable
,
natural
feeling
to
me
,
and
even
though
I
suffered
from
it
I
*NL*
found
it
charming
.
I
have
been
a
fool
.
The
ideas
I
had
in
my
head
about
*NL*
Paris
prevented
me
from
appreciating
that
sublime
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
God
what
a
contrast
and
what
do
I
find
here

Arid

haughty

vanity

all
the
fine
shades
of
wounded
egotism
and
nothing
more

*NL*
*NL*
They
got
up
from
table
.
``
I
must
not
let
my
academician
get
snapped
up
,
''
*NL*
said
Julien
to
himself
.
He
went
up
to
him
as
they
were
passing
into
the
*NL*
garden
,
assumed
an
air
of
soft
submissiveness
and
shared
in
his
fury
*NL*
against
the
success
of
Hernani
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
only
we
were
still
in
the
days
of

_
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
would
not
have
dared
,
''
exclaimed
the
academician
with
a
*NL*
gesture
worthy
of
Talma
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
quoted
some
words
from
Virgil
's
Georgics
in
reference
to
a
*NL*
flower
and
expressed
the
opinion
that
nothing
was
equal
to
the
abbe
*NL*
Delille
's
verses
.
In
a
word
he
flattered
the
academician
in
every
*NL*
possible
way
.
He
then
said
to
him
with
the
utmost
indifference
,
``
I
*NL*
suppose
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
has
inherited
something
from
some
uncle
*NL*
for
whom
she
is
in
mourning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
belong
to
the
house
?
''
said
the
academician
stopping
short
,
*NL*
``
and
you
do
not
know
her
folly
?
As
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
strange
her

mother
should
allow
her
to
do
such
things
,
but
between
ourselves
,
they
*NL*
do
not
shine
in
this
household
exactly
by
their
force
of
character
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
's
share
has
to
do
for
all
of
them
,
and
governs
them
.
*NL*
To-day
is
the
thirtieth
of
April
!
''
and
the
academician
stopped
and
*NL*
looked
meaningly
at
Julien
.
Julien
smiled
with
the
most
knowing
*NL*
expression
he
could
master
.
``
What
connection
can
there
be
between
*NL*
ruling
a
household
,
wearing
a
black
dress
,
and
the
thirtieth
April
?
''
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
.
``
I
must
be
even
sillier
than
I
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
confess
...
''
he
said
to
the
academician
while
he
continued
to
*NL*
question
him
with
his
look
.
``
Let
us
take
a
turn
round
the
garden
,
''
*NL*
said
the
academician
delighted
at
seeing
an
opportunity
of
telling
a
*NL*
long
and
well-turned
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
is
it
really
possible
you
do
not
know
what
happened
on
the
30th
*NL*
April
,
1574
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
?
''
said
Julien
in
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
place
de
Greve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
extremely
astonished
that
these
words
did
not
supply
him
*NL*
with
the
key
.
His
curiosity
and
his
expectation
of
a
tragic
interest
*NL*
which
would
be
in
such
harmony
with
his
own
character
gave
his
eyes
*NL*
that
brilliance
which
the
teller
of
a
story
likes
to
see
so
much
in
*NL*
the
person
who
is
listening
to
him
.
The
academician
was
delighted
at
*NL*
finding
a
virgin
ear
,
and
narrated
at
length
to
Julien
how
Boniface
de
*NL*
la
Mole
,
the
handsomest
young
man
of
this
century
together
with
Annibal
*NL*
de
Coconasso
,
his
friend
,
a
gentleman
of
Piedmont
,
had
been
beheaded
on
*NL*
the
30th
April
,
1574
.
La
Mole
was
the
adored
lover
of
Queen
Marguerite
*NL*
of
Navarre
and
``
observe
,
''
continued
the
academician
,
``
that
mademoiselle
*NL*
de
La
Mole
's
full
name
is
Mathilde
Marguerite
.
La
Mole
was
at
the
same
*NL*
time
a
favourite
of
the
Duke
d'Alencon
and
the
intimate
friend
of
*NL*
his
mistress
's
husband
,
the
King
of
Navarre
,
subsequently
Henri
IV
.
*NL*
On
Shrove
Tuesday
of
that
year
1574
,
the
court
happened
to
be
at
St.
*NL*
Germain
with
the
poor
king
Charles
IX
.
who
was
dying
.
La
Mole
wished
*NL*
to
rescue
his
friends
the
princes
,
whom
Queen
Catherine
of
Medici
was
*NL*
keeping
prisoner
in
her
Court
.
He
advanced
two
hundred
cavalry
under
*NL*
the
walls
of
St.
Germain
;
the
Duke
d'Alencon
was
frightened
and
La
Mole
*NL*
was
thrown
to
the
executioner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
thing
which
affects
mademoiselle
Mathilde
,
and
what
she
has
*NL*
admitted
to
me
herself
seven
or
eight
years
ago
when
she
was
twelve
,
*NL*
is
a
head
!
a
head
!
--
and
the
academician
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
the
*NL*
heavens
.
What
struck
her
in
this
political
catastrophe
,
was
the
hiding
*NL*
of
Queen
Marguerite
de
Navarre
in
a
house
in
the
place
de
Greve
and
*NL*
her
then
asking
for
her
lover
's
head
.
At
midnight
on
the
following
day
*NL*
she
took
that
head
in
her
carriage
and
went
and
buried
it
herself
in
a
*NL*
chapel
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
at
Montmartre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
?
''
cried
Julien
really
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Mathilde
despises
her
brother
because
,
as
you
see
,
he
*NL*
does
not
bother
one
whit
about
this
ancient
history
,
and
never
wears
*NL*
mourning
on
the
thirtieth
of
April
.
It
is
since
the
time
of
this
*NL*
celebrated
execution
and
in
order
to
recall
the
intimate
friendship
*NL*
of
La
Mole
for
the
said
Coconasso
,
who
Italian
that
he
was
,
bore
*NL*
the
name
of
Annibal
that
all
the
men
of
that
family
bear
that
name
.
*NL*
And
,
''
added
the
academician
lowering
his
voice
,
``
this
Coconasso
was
,
*NL*
according
to
Charles
IX
.
himself
,
one
of
the
cruellest
assassins
of
the
*NL*
twenty-fourth
August
,
1572
.
But
how
is
it
possible
,
my
dear
Sorel
,
that
*NL*
you
should
be
ignorant
of
these
things
--
you
who
take
your
meals
with
*NL*
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
is
why
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
twice
called
her
brother
*NL*
Annibal
at
dinner
.
I
thought
I
had
heard
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
reproach
.
It
is
strange
that
the
marquise
should
allow
such
*NL*
follies
.
The
husband
of
that
great
girl
will
have
a
fine
time
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
remark
was
followed
by
five
or
six
satiric
phrases
.
Julien
was
*NL*
shocked
by
the
joy
which
shone
in
the
academician
's
eyes
.
``
We
are
just
*NL*
a
couple
of
servants
,
''
he
thought
,
``
engaged
in
talking
scandal
about
*NL*
our
masters
.
But
I
ought
not
to
be
astonished
at
anything
this
academy
*NL*
man
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
surprised
him
on
his
knees
one
day
before
the
marquise
de
*NL*
la
Mole
;
he
was
asking
her
for
a
tobacco
receivership
for
a
nephew
in
*NL*
the
provinces
.
In
the
evening
a
little
chambermaid
of
mademoiselle
de
*NL*
la
Mole
,
who
was
paying
court
to
Julien
,
just
as
Elisa
had
used
to
do
,
*NL*
gave
him
to
understand
that
her
mistress
's
mourning
was
very
far
from
*NL*
being
worn
simply
to
attract
attention
.
This
eccentricity
was
rooted
in
*NL*
her
character
.
She
really
loved
that
la
Mole
,
the
beloved
lover
of
the
*NL*
most
witty
queen
of
the
century
,
who
had
died
through
trying
to
set
his
*NL*
friends
at
liberty
--
and
what
friends
!
The
first
prince
of
the
blood
and
*NL*
Henri
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accustomed
as
he
had
been
to
the
perfect
naturalness
which
shone
*NL*
throughout
madame
de
Renal
's
whole
demeanour
,
Julien
could
not
help
*NL*
finding
all
the
women
of
Paris
affected
,
and
,
though
by
no
means
of
a
*NL*
morose
disposition
,
found
nothing
to
say
to
them
.
Mademoiselle
de
la
*NL*
Mole
was
an
exception
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
began
to
cease
taking
for
coldness
of
heart
that
kind
of
beauty
*NL*
which
attaches
importance
to
a
noble
bearing
.
He
had
long
conversations
*NL*
with
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
who
would
sometimes
walk
with
him
in
*NL*
the
garden
after
dinner
.
She
told
him
one
day
that
she
was
reading
*NL*
the
History
of
D'Aubigne
and
also
Brantome
.
``
Strange
books
to
read
,
''
*NL*
thought
Julien
;
``
and
the
marquis
does
not
allow
her
to
read
Walter
*NL*
Scott
's
novels
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
him
one
day
,
with
that
pleased
brilliancy
in
her
eyes
,
which
*NL*
is
the
real
test
of
genuine
admiration
,
about
a
characteristic
act
of
a
*NL*
young
woman
of
the
reign
of
Henry
III.
,
which
she
had
just
read
in
the
*NL*
memoirs
of
L'Etoile
.
Finding
her
husband
unfaithful
she
stabbed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
vanity
was
nattered
.
A
person
who
was
surrounded
by
so
much
*NL*
homage
,
and
who
governed
the
whole
house
,
according
to
the
academician
,
*NL*
deigned
to
talk
to
him
on
a
footing
almost
resembling
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
made
a
mistake
,
''
thought
Julien
soon
afterwards
.
``
This
is
not
*NL*
familiarity
,
I
am
simply
the
confidante
of
a
tragedy
,
she
needs
to
*NL*
speak
to
someone
.
I
pass
in
this
family
for
a
man
of
learning
.
I
will
*NL*
go
and
read
Brantome
,
D'Aubigne
,
L'Etoile
.
I
shall
then
be
able
to
*NL*
challenge
some
of
the
anecdotes
which
madame
de
la
Mole
speaks
to
me
*NL*
about
.
I
want
to
leave
off
this
role
of
the
passive
confidante
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
conversations
with
this
young
girl
,
whose
demeanour
was
so
*NL*
impressive
and
yet
so
easy
,
gradually
became
more
interesting
.
He
*NL*
forgot
his
grim
role
of
the
rebel
plebian
.
He
found
her
well-informed
*NL*
and
even
logical
.
Her
opinions
in
the
gardens
were
very
different
to
*NL*
those
which
she
owned
to
in
the
salon
.
Sometimes
she
exhibited
an
*NL*
enthusiasm
and
a
frankness
which
were
in
absolute
contrast
to
her
usual
*NL*
cold
haughtiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wars
of
the
League
were
the
heroic
days
of
France
,
''
she
said
*NL*
to
him
one
day
,
with
eyes
shining
with
enthusiasm
.
``
Then
everyone
*NL*
fought
to
gain
something
which
he
desired
,
for
the
sake
of
his
party
's
*NL*
triumph
,
and
not
just
in
order
to
win
a
cross
as
in
the
days
of
your
*NL*
emperor
.
Admit
that
there
was
then
less
egotism
and
less
pettiness
.
I
*NL*
love
that
century
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Boniface
de
la
Mole
was
the
hero
of
it
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
he
was
loved
in
a
way
that
it
is
perhaps
sweet
to
be
loved
.
*NL*
What
woman
alive
now
would
not
be
horrified
at
touching
the
head
of
her
*NL*
decapitated
lover
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
la
Mole
called
her
daughter
.
To
be
effective
hypocrisy
*NL*
ought
to
hide
itself
,
yet
Julien
had
half
confided
his
admiration
for
*NL*
Napoleon
to
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
remained
alone
in
the
garden
.
``
That
is
the
immense
advantage
*NL*
they
have
over
us
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Their
ancestors
lift
them
*NL*
above
vulgar
sentiments
,
and
they
have
not
got
always
to
be
thinking
*NL*
about
their
subsistence
!
What
misery
,
''
he
added
bitterly
.
``
I
am
not
*NL*
worthy
to
discuss
these
great
matters
.
My
life
is
nothing
more
than
a
*NL*
series
of
hypocrisies
because
I
have
not
got
a
thousand
francs
a
year
*NL*
with
which
to
buy
my
bread
and
butter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
came
running
back
.
``
What
are
you
dreaming
about
,
monsieur
?
''
*NL*
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
tired
of
despising
himself
.
Through
sheer
pride
he
frankly
*NL*
told
her
his
thoughts
.
He
blushed
a
great
deal
while
talking
to
such
*NL*
a
person
about
his
own
poverty
.
He
tried
to
make
it
as
plain
as
he
*NL*
could
that
he
was
not
asking
for
anything
.
Mathilde
never
thought
*NL*
him
so
handsome
;
she
detected
in
him
an
expression
of
frankness
and
*NL*
sensitiveness
which
he
often
lacked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
a
month
of
this
episode
Julien
was
pensively
walking
in
the
*NL*
garden
of
the
hotel
;
but
his
face
had
no
longer
the
hardness
and
*NL*
philosophic
superciliousness
which
the
chronic
consciousness
of
his
*NL*
inferior
position
had
used
to
write
upon
it
.
He
had
just
escorted
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
to
the
door
of
the
salon
.
She
said
she
had
hurt
*NL*
her
foot
while
running
with
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
leaned
on
my
arm
in
a
very
singular
way
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
*NL*
``
Am
I
a
coxcomb
,
or
is
it
true
that
she
has
taken
a
fancy
to
me
?
She
*NL*
listens
to
me
so
gently
,
even
when
I
confess
to
her
all
the
sufferings
*NL*
of
my
pride
!
She
too
,
who
is
so
haughty
to
everyone
!
They
would
be
*NL*
very
astonished
in
the
salon
if
they
saw
that
expression
of
hers
.
It
*NL*
is
quite
certain
that
she
does
not
show
anyone
else
such
sweetness
and
*NL*
goodness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
endeavoured
not
to
exaggerate
this
singular
friendship
.
He
*NL*
himself
compared
it
to
an
armed
truce
.
When
they
met
again
each
day
,
*NL*
they
almost
seemed
before
they
took
up
the
almost
intimate
tone
of
the
*NL*
previous
day
to
ask
themselves
``
are
we
going
to
be
friends
or
enemies
*NL*
to-day
?
''
Julien
had
realised
that
to
allow
himself
to
be
insulted
*NL*
with
impunity
even
once
by
this
haughty
girl
would
mean
the
loss
of
*NL*
everything
.
``
If
I
have
got
to
quarrel
would
it
not
be
better
that
it
*NL*
should
be
straight
away
in
defending
the
rights
of
my
own
pride
,
*NL*
than
in
parrying
the
expressions
of
contempt
which
would
follow
the
*NL*
slightest
abandonment
of
my
duty
to
my
own
self-respect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
many
occasions
,
on
days
when
she
was
in
a
bad
temper
Mathilde
,
tried
*NL*
to
play
the
great
lady
with
him
.
These
attempts
were
extremely
subtle
,
*NL*
but
Julien
rebuffed
them
roughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
brusquely
interrupted
her
.
``
Has
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
any
*NL*
orders
to
give
her
father
's
secretary
?
''
he
said
to
her
.
``
If
so
he
must
*NL*
listen
to
her
orders
,
and
execute
them
,
but
apart
from
that
he
has
not
*NL*
a
single
word
to
say
to
her
.
He
is
not
paid
to
tell
her
his
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
kind
of
life
,
together
with
the
singular
surmises
which
it
*NL*
occasioned
,
dissipated
the
boredom
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
*NL*
experience
in
that
magnificent
salon
,
where
everyone
was
afraid
,
and
*NL*
where
any
kind
of
jest
was
in
bad
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
humorous
if
she
loved
me
but
whether
she
loves
me
or
*NL*
not
,
''
went
on
Julien
,
``
I
have
for
my
confidential
friend
a
girl
of
*NL*
spirit
before
whom
I
see
the
whole
household
quake
,
while
the
marquis
*NL*
de
Croisenois
does
so
more
than
anyone
else
.
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
that
*NL*
same
young
man
who
is
so
polite
,
so
gentle
,
and
so
brave
,
and
who
has
*NL*
combined
all
those
advantages
of
birth
and
fortune
a
single
one
of
*NL*
which
would
put
my
heart
at
rest
--
he
is
madly
in
love
with
her
,
he
*NL*
ought
to
marry
her
.
How
many
letters
has
M.
de
la
Mole
made
me
write
*NL*
to
the
two
notaries
in
order
to
arrange
the
contract
?
And
I
,
though
I
*NL*
am
an
absolute
inferior
when
I
have
my
pen
in
my
hand
,
why
,
I
triumph
*NL*
over
that
young
man
two
hours
afterwards
in
this
very
garden
;
for
,
*NL*
after
all
,
her
preference
is
striking
and
direct
.
Perhaps
she
hates
*NL*
him
because
she
sees
in
him
a
future
husband
.
She
is
haughty
enough
*NL*
for
that
.
As
for
her
kindness
to
me
,
I
receive
it
in
my
capacity
of
*NL*
confidential
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
,
I
am
either
mad
or
she
is
making
advances
to
me
;
the
colder
*NL*
and
more
respectful
I
show
myself
to
her
,
the
more
she
runs
after
me
.
*NL*
It
may
be
a
deliberate
piece
of
affectation
;
but
I
see
her
eyes
become
*NL*
animated
when
I
appear
unexpectedly
.
Can
the
women
of
Paris
manage
to
*NL*
act
to
such
an
extent
.
What
does
it
matter
to
me
!
I
have
appearances
in
*NL*
my
favour
,
let
us
enjoy
appearances
.
Heavens
,
how
beautiful
she
is
!
*NL*
How
I
like
her
great
blue
eyes
when
I
see
them
at
close
quarters
,
and
*NL*
they
look
at
me
in
the
way
they
often
do
?
What
a
difference
between
*NL*
this
spring
and
that
of
last
year
,
when
I
lived
an
unhappy
life
among
*NL*
three
hundred
dirty
malicious
hypocrites
,
and
only
kept
myself
afloat
*NL*
through
sheer
force
of
character
,
I
was
almost
as
malicious
as
they
*NL*
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
young
girl
is
making
fun
of
me
,
''
Julien
would
think
in
his
*NL*
suspicious
days
.
``
She
is
acting
in
concert
with
her
brother
to
make
*NL*
a
fool
of
me
.
But
she
seems
to
have
an
absolute
contempt
for
her
*NL*
brother
's
lack
of
energy
.
He
is
brave
and
that
is
all
.
He
has
not
a
*NL*
thought
which
dares
to
deviate
from
the
conventional
.
It
is
always
*NL*
I
who
have
to
take
up
the
cudgels
in
his
defence
.
A
young
girl
of
*NL*
nineteen
!
Can
one
at
that
age
act
up
faithfully
every
second
of
the
*NL*
day
to
the
part
which
one
has
determined
to
play
.
On
the
other
hand
*NL*
whenever
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
fixes
her
eyes
on
me
with
a
singular
*NL*
expression
comte
Norbert
always
goes
away
.
I
think
that
suspicious
.
*NL*
Ought
he
not
to
be
indignant
at
his
sister
singling
out
a
servant
of
*NL*
her
household
?
For
that
is
how
I
heard
the
Duke
de
Chaulnes
speak
about
*NL*
me
.
This
recollection
caused
anger
to
supersede
every
other
emotion
.
It
*NL*
is
simply
a
fashion
for
old
fashioned
phraseology
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
eccentric
duke
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
is
pretty
!
''
continued
Julien
with
a
tigerish
expression
,
``
I
*NL*
will
have
her
,
I
will
then
go
away
,
and
woe
to
him
who
disturbs
me
in
*NL*
my
flight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
became
Julien
's
sole
preoccupation
.
He
could
not
think
of
*NL*
anything
else
.
His
days
passed
like
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
moment
when
he
tried
to
concentrate
on
some
important
matter
*NL*
his
mind
became
a
blank
,
and
he
would
wake
up
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
afterwards
with
a
beating
heart
and
an
anxious
mind
,
brooding
over
this
*NL*
idea
``
does
she
love
me
?

CHAPTER
XLI
*NL*
*NL*
A
YOUNG
GIRL
'S
DOMINION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
admire
her
beauty
but
I
fear
her
intellect
.
--
_
Merimee
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
Julien
had
employed
the
time
which
he
spent
in
exaggerating
*NL*
Matilde
's
beauty
or
in
working
himself
up
into
a
rage
against
that
*NL*
family
haughtiness
which
she
was
forgetting
for
his
sake
in
examining
*NL*
what
was
going
on
in
the
salon
,
he
would
have
understood
the
secret
of
*NL*
her
dominion
over
all
that
surrounded
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
anyone
displeased
mademoiselle
de
La
Mole
she
managed
to
punish
*NL*
the
offender
by
a
jest
which
was
so
guarded
,
so
well
chosen
,
so
polite
*NL*
and
so
neatly
timed
,
that
the
more
the
victim
thought
about
it
,
the
*NL*
sorer
grew
the
wound
.
She
gradually
became
positively
terrible
to
*NL*
wounded
vanity
.
As
she
attached
no
value
to
many
things
which
the
*NL*
rest
of
her
family
very
seriously
wanted
,
she
always
struck
them
as
*NL*
self-possessed
.
The
salons
of
the
aristocracy
are
nice
enough
to
brag
*NL*
about
when
you
leave
them
,
but
that
is
all
;
mere
politeness
alone
only
*NL*
counts
for
something
in
its
own
right
during
the
first
few
days
.
Julien
*NL*
experienced
this
after
the
first
fascination
and
the
first
astonishment
*NL*
had
passed
off
.
``
Politeness
,
''
he
said
to
himself
``
is
nothing
but
the
*NL*
absence
of
that
bad
temper
which
would
be
occasioned
by
bad
manners
.
''
*NL*
Mathilde
was
frequently
bored
;
perhaps
she
would
have
been
bored
*NL*
anywhere
.
She
then
found
a
real
distraction
and
real
pleasure
in
*NL*
sharpening
an
epigram
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
perhaps
in
order
to
have
more
amusing
victims
than
her
great
*NL*
relations
,
the
academician
and
the
five
or
six
other
men
of
inferior
*NL*
class
who
paid
her
court
,
that
she
had
given
encouragement
to
the
*NL*
marquis
de
Croisenois
,
the
comte
Caylus
and
two
or
three
other
young
*NL*
men
of
the
highest
rank
.
They
simply
represented
new
subjects
for
*NL*
epigrams
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
admit
with
reluctance
,
for
we
are
fond
of
Mathilde
,
that
she
*NL*
had
received
many
letters
from
several
of
them
and
had
sometimes
*NL*
answered
them
.
We
hasten
to
add
that
this
person
constitutes
an
*NL*
exception
to
the
manners
of
the
century
.
Lack
of
prudence
is
not
*NL*
generally
the
fault
with
which
the
pupils
of
the
noble
convent
of
the
*NL*
Sacred
Heart
can
be
reproached
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
returned
to
Mathilde
a
fairly
*NL*
compromising
letter
which
she
had
written
the
previous
night
.
He
*NL*
thought
that
he
was
thereby
advancing
his
cause
a
great
deal
by
taking
*NL*
this
highly
prudent
step
.
But
the
very
imprudence
of
her
correspondence
*NL*
was
the
very
element
in
it
Mathilde
liked
.
Her
pleasure
was
to
stake
*NL*
her
fate
.
She
did
not
speak
to
him
again
for
six
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
amused
herself
with
the
letters
of
these
young
men
,
but
in
her
view
*NL*
they
were
all
like
each
other
.
It
was
invariably
a
case
of
the
most
*NL*
profound
,
the
most
melancholy
,
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
all
represent
the
same
perfect
man
,
ready
to
leave
for
*NL*
Palestine
,
''
she
exclaimed
to
her
cousin
.
``
Can
you
conceive
of
anything
*NL*
more
insipid
?
So
these
are
the
letters
I
am
going
to
receive
all
my
*NL*
life
!
There
can
only
be
a
change
every
twenty
years
according
to
the
*NL*
kind
of
vogue
which
happens
to
be
fashionable
.
They
must
have
had
more
*NL*
colour
in
them
in
the
days
of
the
Empire
.
In
those
days
all
these
young
*NL*
society
men
had
seen
or
accomplished
feats
which
really
had
an
element
*NL*
of
greatness
.
The
Duke
of
N
--
my
uncle
was
at
Wagram
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
brains
do
you
need
to
deal
a
sabre
blow
?
And
when
they
have
had
*NL*
the
luck
to
do
that
they
talk
of
it
so
often
!
''
said
mademoiselle
de
*NL*
Sainte-Heredite
,
Mathilde
's
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
those
tales
give
me
pleasure
.
Being
in
a
real
battle
,
a
battle
*NL*
of
Napoleon
,
where
six
thousand
soldiers
were
killed
,
why
,
that
's
proof
*NL*
of
courage
.
Exposing
one
's
self
to
danger
elevates
the
soul
and
saves
*NL*
it
from
the
boredom
in
which
my
poor
admirers
seem
to
be
sunk
;
and
that
*NL*
boredom
is
contagious
.
Which
of
them
ever
thought
of
doing
anything
*NL*
extraordinary
?
They
are
trying
to
win
my
hand
,
a
pretty
business
to
*NL*
be
sure
!
I
am
rich
and
my
father
will
procure
advancement
for
his
*NL*
son-in-law
.
Well
!
I
hope
he
'll
manage
to
find
someone
who
is
a
little
*NL*
bit
amusing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
's
keen
,
sharp
and
picturesque
view
of
life
spoilt
her
language
*NL*
as
one
sees
.
An
expression
of
hers
would
often
constitute
a
blemish
*NL*
in
the
eyes
of
her
polished
friends
.
If
she
had
been
less
fashionable
*NL*
they
would
almost
have
owned
that
her
manner
of
speaking
was
,
from
the
*NL*
standpoint
of
feminine
delicacy
,
to
some
extent
unduly
coloured
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
on
her
side
,
was
very
unjust
towards
the
handsome
cavaliers
who
*NL*
fill
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
.
She
envisaged
the
future
not
with
terror
,
*NL*
that
would
have
been
a
vivid
emotion
,
but
with
a
disgust
which
was
very
*NL*
rare
at
her
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
she
desire
?
Fortune
,
good
birth
,
wit
,
beauty
,
according
to
*NL*
what
the
world
said
,
and
according
to
what
she
believed
,
all
these
*NL*
things
had
been
lavished
upon
her
by
the
hands
of
chance
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
this
was
the
state
of
mind
of
the
most
envied
heiress
of
the
*NL*
faubourg
Saint-Germain
when
she
began
to
find
pleasure
in
walking
with
*NL*
Julien
.
She
was
astonished
at
his
pride
;
she
admired
the
ability
of
the
*NL*
little
bourgeois
.
``
He
will
manage
to
get
made
a
bishop
like
the
abbe
*NL*
Mouray
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
the
sincere
and
unaffected
opposition
with
which
our
hero
received
*NL*
several
of
her
ideas
filled
her
mind
;
she
continued
to
think
about
*NL*
it
,
she
told
her
friend
the
slightest
details
of
the
conversation
,
*NL*
but
thought
that
she
would
never
succeed
in
fully
rendering
all
their
*NL*
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
idea
suddenly
flashed
across
her
;
``
I
have
the
happiness
of
loving
,
''
*NL*
she
said
to
herself
one
day
with
an
incredible
ecstasy
of
joy
.
``
I
am
in
*NL*
love
,
I
am
in
love
,
it
is
clear
!
Where
can
a
young
,
witty
and
beautiful
*NL*
girl
of
my
own
age
find
sensations
if
not
in
love
?
It
is
no
good
.
I
*NL*
shall
never
feel
any
love
for
Croisenois
,
Caylus
,
and
_
tutti
quanti
_
.
*NL*
They
are
unimpeachable
,
perhaps
too
unimpeachable
;
any
way
they
bore
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rehearsed
in
her
mind
all
the
descriptions
of
passion
which
she
*NL*
had
read
in
_
Manon
Lescaut
_
,
the
_
Nouvelle
Heloise
_
,
the
_
Letters
of
*NL*
a
Portuguese
Nun
_
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
It
was
only
a
question
of
course
of
the
*NL*
grand
passion
;
light
love
was
unworthy
of
a
girl
of
her
age
and
birth
.
*NL*
She
vouchsafed
the
name
of
love
to
that
heroic
sentiment
which
was
met
*NL*
with
in
France
in
the
time
of
Henri
III
.
and
Bassompierre
.
That
love
*NL*
did
not
basely
yield
to
obstacles
,
but
,
far
from
it
,
inspired
great
*NL*
deeds
.
``
How
unfortunate
for
me
that
there
is
not
a
real
court
like
that
*NL*
of
Catherine
de
'
Medici
or
of
Louis
XIII
.
I
feel
equal
to
the
boldest
*NL*
and
greatest
actions
.
What
would
I
not
make
of
a
king
who
was
a
man
of
*NL*
spirit
like
Louis
XIII
.
if
he
were
sighing
at
my
feet
!
I
would
take
*NL*
him
to
the
Vendee
,
as
the
Baron
de
Tolly
is
so
fond
of
saying
,
and
*NL*
from
that
base
he
would
re-conquer
his
kingdom
;
then
no
more
about
a
*NL*
charter
--
and
Julien
would
help
me
.
What
does
he
lack
?
name
and
fortune
.
*NL*
He
will
make
a
name
,
he
will
win
a
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Croisenois
lacks
nothing
,
and
he
will
never
be
anything
else
all
his
*NL*
life
but
a
duke
who
is
half
`
ultra
'
and
half
Liberal
,
an
undecided
*NL*
being
who
never
goes
to
extremes
and
consequently
always
plays
second
*NL*
fiddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
great
action
is
not
an
extreme
at
the
moment
when
it
is
*NL*
undertaken
?
It
is
only
after
accomplishment
that
it
seems
possible
to
*NL*
commonplace
individuals
.
Yes
,
it
is
love
with
all
its
miracles
which
*NL*
is
going
to
reign
over
my
heart
;
I
feel
as
much
from
the
fire
which
is
*NL*
thrilling
me
.
Heaven
owed
me
this
boon
.
It
will
not
then
have
lavished
*NL*
in
vain
all
its
bounties
on
one
single
person
.
My
happiness
will
be
*NL*
worthy
of
me
.
Each
day
will
no
longer
be
the
cold
replica
of
the
day
*NL*
before
.
There
is
grandeur
and
audacity
in
the
very
fact
of
daring
to
*NL*
love
a
man
,
placed
so
far
beneath
me
by
his
social
position
.
Let
us
see
*NL*
what
happens
,
will
he
continue
to
deserve
me
?
I
will
abandon
him
at
the
*NL*
first
sign
of
weakness
which
I
detect
.
A
girl
of
my
birth
and
of
that
*NL*
mediaeval
temperament
which
they
are
good
enough
to
ascribe
to
me
-LRB-
she
*NL*
was
quoting
from
her
father

not
behave
like
a
fool

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
should
I
not
be
behaving
like
a
fool
if
I
were
to
love
the
marquis
*NL*
de
Croisenois

I
should
simply
have
a
new
edition
over
again
of
that
*NL*
happiness
enjoyed
by
my
girl
cousins
which
I
so
utterly
despise
.
I
*NL*
already
know
everything
the
poor
marquis
would
say
to
me
and
every
*NL*
answer
I
should
make

What

the
good
of
a
love
which
makes
one

yawn

One
might

well
be
in

I
shall
have
a
celebration

of
the
signing
of
a
contract
just
like
my
younger

all
break
down

The

up

was

The

need
of
staking
something
was
the
key
to
the
character

her
quarrels

sixteen

Now

what
can
a

stake

The

*NL*
precious
thing
she
has
:
her
reputation

the
esteem
of

turn
pale

Mademoiselle

was
so
engrossed
in
these
pretty
arguments
that
*NL*
without
realising
what
she
was
doing
,
she
praised
Julien
to
the
marquis
*NL*
de
Croisenois
and
her
brother
on
the
following
day
.
Her
eloquence
went
*NL*
so
far
that
it
provoked
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

careful

She
was
careful
not
to
answer
,
but
hastened
to
rally
her
brother
and
*NL*
the
marquis
de

on
the
apprehension
which
energy
caused
them

*NL*
``
It

horrified
her

occasioned

much

the
day
afterwards
she
regarded
them

as
tantamount

These
last
words
made
her
pensive
;
they
recalled
painful
memories

*NL*
deprived
her
of
all

boldness

These
words
reminded
her
of
the
jests
*NL*
of
MM

de
Caylus
,
Croisenois
,
de

and
her
brother
;
these
gentlemen
*NL*
joined
in
censuring
Julien
for
his
priestly
demeanour
,
which
they
said
*NL*
was
humble
and
hypocritical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

she
went
on
suddenly
with
her
eyes
gleaming
with
joy

the
very
*NL*
bitterness

the
most
distinguished
man
whom
we
have
seen
this

the
things

they
make
fun
of

He
has
the
element
of
greatness
and
they
are
shocked
by
it
.
Yes

they
,
*NL*
the
very
men
who
are
so
good
and
so
charitable
in
other
matters

It
is
*NL*
a
fact
that
he
is
poor
and
that
he
has
studied
in
order
to
be
a
priest
;
*NL*
they
are
the
heads
of
a
squadron
and
never
had
any
need
of
studying
;

they
found
it
less
trouble

In

he
must
wear

if
he
is

his
merit

nothing
could
be
clearer

And
as
for

that
priest-like
expression

why
he
no
longer
has
it
after
we
have
been
*NL*
alone
for
some
moments
,
and
after
those
gentlemen
have
evolved
what
*NL*
they
imagine
to
be
a
subtle
and
impromptu
epigram
,
is
not
their
first
*NL*
look
towards
Julien

I
have
often
noticed
it

And
yet
they
know
well

that
he
never

to
them

he
is
questioned

I
am
the
only
one

He
thinks
I
have
a
lofty

only
answers
the

points
they
raise
sufficiently
to
be
polite

He
immediately
reverts
*NL*
into
respectfulness

But
with
me
he
will
discuss
things
for
whole
*NL*
hours
,
he
is
not
certain
of
his
ideas
so
long
as
I
find
the
slightest
*NL*
objection
to
them

There
has
not
been
a
single
rifle-shot
fired
all

this

words
have
been
the
only
means

attracting
attention

*NL*
The
Comte

Caylus
had
or
pretended
to
have
a
great
passion
for
*NL*
horses
;
he
passed
his
life
in
his
stables
and
often
breakfasted
there
.
*NL*
This
great
passion
,
together
with
his
habit
of
never
laughing
,
won
for
*NL*
him
much
respect
among
his
friends
:
he
was
the
eagle
of
the
little
*NL*
circle
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
had
reassembled
the
following
day
behind
madame
de

*NL*
Mole
's
armchair
,
M.
de
Caylus
,
supported
by
Croisenois
and
by
Norbert
,
*NL*
began
in
Julien
's
absence
to
attack
sharply
the
high
opinion
which
*NL*
Mathilde
entertained
for
Julien
.
He
did
this
without
any
provocation
,
*NL*
and
almost
the
very
minute
that
he
caught
sight
of
mademoiselle
de
la
*NL*
Mole
.
She
tumbled
to
the
subtlety
immediately
and
was
delighted
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
there
they
are
all
leagued
together

she
said
to
herself
,
``
against
*NL*

man
of
genius

has
not
ten

bless

with

can
not

them

in
so
far
as
he
is
questioned

are

coat
and
all

how
would
things
stand

*NL*
had
epaulettes

*NL*
She
had
never
been
more
brilliant
,
hardly
had
Caylus
and
his
allies
*NL*
opened
their
attack
than
she
riddled
them
with
sarcastic
jests
.
When
*NL*
the
fire
of
these
brilliant
officers
was
at
length
extinguished
she
*NL*
said
to
M.
de
Caylus
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
that
some
gentleman
in
the
Franche-Comte
mountains
finds
out
*NL*
to-morrow
that
Julien
is
his
natural
son
and
gives
him
a
name
and
*NL*
some
thousands
of
francs
,
why
in
six
months
he
will
be
an
officer
of
*NL*
hussars
like
you
,
gentlemen
,
in
six
weeks
he
will
have
moustaches
like
*NL*
you
gentlemen

And
then
his
greatness
of
character
will
no
longer
be
*NL*
an
object
of
ridicule
.
I
shall
then
see
you
reduced
,
monsieur
the
*NL*
future
duke
,
to
this
stale
and
bad
argument
,
the
superiority
of
the
*NL*
court
nobility
over
the
provincial
nobility
.
But
where
will
you
be
*NL*
if
I
choose
to
push
you
to
extremities
and
am
mischievous
enough
to
*NL*
make
Julien

father
a
Spanish
duke

who
was
a
prisoner
of
war
at

Besancon
in
the
time
of
Napoleon

and
who
out
of
conscientious
scruples

acknowledges
him
on
his
death
bed

MM
.
de
Caylus
,
and
de
Croisenois
*NL*
found
all
these
assumptions
of
illegitimacy
in
rather
bad
taste
.
That
*NL*
was
all
they
saw
in
Mathilde
's
reasoning
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
sister
's
words
were
so
clear
that
Norbert
,
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
submissiveness
,
assumed
a
solemn
air
,
which
one
must
admit
did
not
*NL*
harmonise
very
well
with
his
amiable
,
smiling
face
.
He
ventured
to
say
*NL*
a
few
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ill
?
my
dear
,
''
answered
Mathilde
with
a
little
air
of
*NL*
seriousness
.
``
You
must
be
very
bad
to
answer
jests
by
moralizing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moralizing
from
you
!
Are
you
soliciting
a
job
as
prefect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
soon
forgot
the
irritation
of
the
comte
de
Caylus
,
the
bad
*NL*
temper
of
Norbert
,
and
the
taciturn
despair
of
M.
de
Croisenois
.
She
*NL*
had
to
decide
one
way
or
the
other
a
fatal
question
which
had
just
*NL*
seized
upon
her
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Julien
is
sincere
enough
with
me
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
a
man
at
*NL*
his
age
,
in
a
inferior
position
,
and
rendered
unhappy
as
he
is
by
an
*NL*
extraordinary
ambition
,
must
have
need
of
a
woman
friend
.
I
am
perhaps
*NL*
that
friend
,
but
I
see
no
sign
of
love
in
him
.
Taking
into
account
the
*NL*
audacity
of
his
character
he
would
surely
have
spoken
to
me
about
his
*NL*
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
uncertainty
and
this
discussion
with
herself
which
henceforth
*NL*
monopolised
Mathilde
's
time
,
and
in
connection
with
which
she
found
new
*NL*
arguments
each
time
that
Julien
spoke
to
her
,
completely
routed
those
*NL*
fits
of
boredom
to
which
she
had
been
so
liable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daughter
as
she
was
of
a
man
of
intellect
who
might
become
a
minister
,
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
had
been
when
in
the
convent
of
the
Sacred
*NL*
Heart
,
the
object
of
the
most
excessive
flattery
.
This
misfortune
can
*NL*
never
be
compensated
for
.
She
had
been
persuaded
that
by
reason
of
all
*NL*
her
advantages
of
birth
,
fortune
,
etc.
,
she
ought
to
be
happier
than
*NL*
any
one
else
.
This
is
the
cause
of
the
boredom
of
princes
and
of
all
*NL*
their
follies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
had
not
escaped
the
deadly
influence
of
this
idea
.
However
*NL*
intelligent
one
may
be
,
one
can
not
at
the
age
of
ten
be
on
one
's
guard
*NL*
against
the
flatteries
of
a
whole
convent
,
which
are
apparently
so
well
*NL*
founded
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
that
she
had
decided
that
she
loved
Julien
,
she
*NL*
was
no
longer
bored
.
She
congratulated
herself
every
day
on
having
*NL*
deliberately
decided
to
indulge
in
a
grand
passion
.
``
This
amusement
*NL*
is
very
dangerous
,
''
she
thought
.
``
All
the
better
,
all
the
better
,
a
*NL*
thousand
times
.
Without
a
grand
passion
I
should
be
languishing
in
*NL*
boredom
during
the
finest
time
of
my
life
,
the
years
from
sixteen
*NL*
to
twenty
.
I
have
already
wasted
my
finest
years
:
all
my
pleasure
*NL*
consisted
in
being
obliged
to
listen
to
the
silly
arguments
of
my
*NL*
mother
's
friends
who
when
at
Coblentz
in
1792
were
not
quite
so
strict
,
*NL*
so
they
say
,
as
their
words
of
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
while
Mathilde
was
a
prey
to
these
great
fits
of
uncertainty
*NL*
that
Julien
was
baffled
by
those
long
looks
of
hers
which
lingered
upon
*NL*
him
.
He
noticed
,
no
doubt
,
an
increased
frigidity
in
the
manner
of
*NL*
comte
Norbert
,
and
a
fresh
touch
of
haughtiness
in
the
manner
of
MM
.
de
*NL*
Caylus
,
de
Luz
and
de
Croisenois
.
He
was
accustomed
to
that
.
He
would
*NL*
sometimes
be
their
victim
in
this
way
at
the
end
of
an
evening
when
,
in
*NL*
view
of
the
position
he
occupied
,
he
had
been
unduly
brilliant
.
Had
it
*NL*
not
been
for
the
especial
welcome
with
which
Mathilde
would
greet
him
,
*NL*
and
the
curiosity
with
which
all
this
society
inspired
him
,
he
would
*NL*
have
avoided
following
these
brilliant
moustachioed
young
men
into
the
*NL*
garden
,
when
they
accompanied
mademoiselle
de
La
Mole
there
,
in
the
*NL*
hour
after
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Julien
would
say
to
himself
,
``
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
deceive
*NL*
myself
,
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
looks
at
me
in
a
very
singular
way
.
*NL*
But
even
when
her
fine
blue
open
eyes
are
fixed
on
me
,
wide
open
with
*NL*
the
most
abandon
,
I
always
detect
behind
them
an
element
of
scrutiny
,
*NL*
self-possession
and
malice
.
Is
it
possible
that
this
may
be
love
?
But
*NL*
how
different
to
madame
de
Renal
's
looks
!

*NL*
One
evening
after
dinner
Julien
,
who
had
followed
M.
de
la
Mole
into
*NL*
his
study
,
was
rapidly
walking
back
to
the
garden
.
He
approached
*NL*
Mathilde
's
circle
without
any
warning
,
and
caught
some
words
pronounced
*NL*
in
a
very
loud
voice
.
She
was
teasing
her
brother
.
Julien
heard
his
*NL*
name
distinctly
pronounced
twice
.
He
appeared
.
There
was
immediately
*NL*
a
profound
silence
and
abortive
efforts
were
made
to
dissipate
it
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
and
her
brother
were
too
animated
to
find
*NL*
another
topic
of
conversation
.
MM

de
Caylus
,
de
Croisenois
,
de
Luz
,
*NL*
and
one
of
their
friends
,
manifested
an
icy
coldness
to
Julien
.
He
went
*NL*
away

CHAPTER
XLIII
*NL*
*NL*
A
PLOT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Disconnected
remarks
,
casual
meetings
,
become
*NL*
transformed
in
the
eyes
of
an
imaginative
man
into
*NL*
the
most
convincing
proofs
,
if
he
has
any
fire
in
his
*NL*
temperament
.
--
_
Schiller
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
day
he
again
caught
Norbert
and
his
sister
talking
about
*NL*
him
.
A
funereal
silence
was
established
on
his
arrival
as
on
the
*NL*
previous
day
.
His
suspicions
were
now
unbounded
.
``
Can
these
charming
*NL*
young
people
have
started
to
make
fun
of
me
?
I
must
own
this
is
much
*NL*
more
probable
,
much
more
natural
than
any
suggested
passion
on
the
part
*NL*
of
mademoiselle
de
La
Mole
for
a
poor
devil
of
a
secretary
.
In
the
*NL*
first
place
,
have
those
people
got
any
passions
at
all
?
Mystification
*NL*
is
their
strong
point
.
They
are
jealous
of
my
poor
little
superiority
*NL*
in
speaking
.
Being
jealous
again
is
one
of
their
weaknesses
.
On
that
*NL*
basis
everything
is
explicable
.
Mademoiselle
de
La
Mole
simply
wants
to
*NL*
persuade
me
that
she
is
marking
me
out
for
special
favour
in
order
to
*NL*
show
me
off
to
her
betrothed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
cruel
suspicion
completely
changed
Julien
's
psychological
*NL*
condition
.
The
idea
found
in
his
heart
a
budding
love
which
it
had
no
*NL*
difficulty
in
destroying
.
This
love
was
only
founded
on
Mathilde
's
rare
*NL*
beauty
,
or
rather
on
her
queenly
manners
and
her
admirable
dresses
.
*NL*
Julien
was
still
a
parvenu
in
this
respect
.
We
are
assured
that
there
*NL*
is
nothing
equal
to
a
pretty
society
women
for
dazzling
a
peasant
*NL*
who
is
at
the
same
time
a
man
of
intellect
,
when
he
is
admitted
to
*NL*
first
class
society
.
It
had
not
been
Mathilde
's
character
which
had
*NL*
given
Julien
food
for
dreams
in
the
days
that
had
just
passed
.
He
had
*NL*
sufficient
sense
to
realise
that
he
knew
nothing
about
her
character
.
*NL*
All
he
saw
of
it
might
be
merely
superficial
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
instance
,
Mathilde
would
not
have
missed
mass
on
Sunday
for
*NL*
anything
in
the
world
.
She
accompanied
her
mother
there
nearly
every
*NL*
time
.
If
when
in
the
salon
of
the
Hotel
de
La
Mole
some
indiscreet
man
*NL*
forgot
where
he
was
,
and
indulged
in
the
remotest
allusion
to
any
jest
*NL*
against
the
real
or
supposed
interests
of
Church
or
State
,
Mathilde
*NL*
immediately
assumed
an
icy
seriousness
.
Her
previously
arch
expression
*NL*
re-assumed
all
the
impassive
haughtiness
of
an
old
family
portrait
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Julien
had
assured
himself
that
she
always
had
one
or
two
of
*NL*
Voltaire
's
most
philosophic
volumes
in
her
room
.
He
himself
would
*NL*
often
steal
some
tomes
of
that
fine
edition
which
was
so
magnificently
*NL*
bound
.
By
moving
each
volume
a
little
distance
from
the
one
next
to
it
*NL*
he
managed
to
hide
the
absence
of
the
one
he
took
away
,
but
he
soon
*NL*
noticed
that
someone
else
was
reading
Voltaire
.
He
had
recourse
to
a
*NL*
trick
worthy
of
the
seminary
and
placed
some
pieces
of
hair
on
those
*NL*
volumes
which
he
thought
were
likely
to
interest
mademoiselle
de
La
*NL*
Mole
.
They
disappeared
for
whole
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
La
Mole
had
lost
patience
with
his
bookseller
,
who
always
sent
*NL*
him
all
the
spurious
memoirs
,
and
had
instructed
Julien
to
buy
all
the
*NL*
new
books
,
which
were
at
all
stimulating
.
But
in
order
to
prevent
the
*NL*
poison
spreading
over
the
household
,
the
secretary
was
ordered
to
place
*NL*
the
books
in
a
little
book-case
that
stood
in
the
marquis
's
own
room
.
*NL*
He
was
soon
quite
certain
that
although
the
new
books
were
hostile
to
*NL*
the
interests
of
both
State
and
Church
,
they
very
quickly
disappeared
.
*NL*
It
was
certainly
not
Norbert
who
read
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
attached
undue
importance
to
this
discovery
,
and
attributed
to
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
a
Machiavellian
role
.
This
seeming
depravity
*NL*
constituted
a
charm
in
his
eyes
,
the
one
moral
charm
,
in
fact
,
which
*NL*
she
possessed
.
He
was
led
into
this
extravagance
by
his
boredom
with
*NL*
hypocrisy
and
moral
platitudes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
more
a
case
of
his
exciting
his
own
imagination
than
of
his
*NL*
being
swept
away
by
his
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
after
he
had
abandoned
himself
to
reveries
about
the
*NL*
elegance
of
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
figure
,
the
excellent
taste
*NL*
of
he
dress
,
the
whiteness
of
her
hand
,
the
beauty
of
her
arm
,
the
*NL*
_
disinvoltura
_
of
all
her
movements
,
that
he
began
to
find
himself
in
*NL*
love
.
Then
in
order
to
complete
the
charm
he
thought
her
a
Catherine
*NL*
de
'
Medici
.
Nothing
was
too
deep
or
too
criminal
for
the
character
*NL*
which
he
ascribed
to
her
.
She
was
the
ideal
of
the
Maslons
,
the
*NL*
Frilairs
,
and
the
Castanedes
whom
he
had
admired
so
much
in
his
youth
.
*NL*
To
put
it
shortly
,
she
represented
in
his
eyes
the
Paris
ideal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Could
anything
possibly
be
more
humorous
than
believing
in
the
depth
or
*NL*
in
the
depravity
of
the
Parisian
character
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
that
this
_
trio
_
is
making
fun
of
me
thought
Julien
.
*NL*
The
reader
knows
little
of
his
character
if
he
has
not
begun
already
*NL*
to
imagine
his
cold
and
gloomy
expression
when
he
answered
Mathilde
's
*NL*
looks
.
A
bitter
irony
rebuffed
those
assurances
of
friendship
which
the
*NL*
astonished
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
ventured
to
hazard
on
two
or
three
*NL*
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Piqued
by
this
sudden
eccentricity
,
the
heart
of
this
young
girl
,
*NL*
though
naturally
cold
,
bored
and
intellectual
,
became
as
impassioned
as
*NL*
it
was
naturally
capable
of
being
.
But
there
was
also
a
large
element
*NL*
of
pride
in
Mathilde
's
character
,
and
the
birth
of
a
sentiment
which
*NL*
made
all
her
happiness
dependent
on
another
,
was
accompanied
by
a
*NL*
gloomy
melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
derived
sufficient
advantage
from
his
stay
in
Paris
to
*NL*
appreciate
that
this
was
not
the
frigid
melancholy
of
ennui
.
Instead
*NL*
of
being
keen
as
she
had
been
on
at
homes
,
theatres
,
and
all
kinds
of
*NL*
distractions
,
she
now
shunned
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Music
sung
by
Frenchmen
bored
Mathilde
to
death
,
yet
Julien
,
who
*NL*
always
made
a
point
of
being
present
when
the
audience
came
out
of
the
*NL*
Opera
,
noticed
that
she
made
a
point
of
getting
taken
there
as
often
*NL*
as
she
could
.
He
thought
he
noticed
that
she
had
lost
a
little
of
that
*NL*
brilliant
neatness
of
touch
which
used
to
be
manifest
in
everything
*NL*
she
did
.
She
would
sometimes
answer
her
friends
with
jests
rendered
*NL*
positively
outrageous
through
the
sheer
force
of
their
stinging
energy
.
*NL*
He
thought
that
she
made
a
special
butt
of
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
.
*NL*
That
young
man
must
be
desperately
in
love
with
money
not
to
give
the
*NL*
go-by
to
that
girl
,
however
rich
she
maybe
,
thought
Julien
.
And
as
for
*NL*
himself
,
indignant
at
these
outrages
on
masculine
self-respect
,
he
*NL*
redoubled
his
frigidity
towards
her
.
Sometimes
he
went
so
far
as
to
*NL*
answer
her
with
scant
courtesy
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
resolution
not
to
become
the
dupe
of
Mathilde
's
signs
*NL*
of
interest
,
these
manifestations
were
so
palpable
on
certain
days
,
and
*NL*
Julien
,
whose
eyes
were
beginning
to
be
opened
,
began
to
find
her
so
*NL*
pretty
,
that
he
was
sometimes
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
young
people
of
society
will
score
in
the
long
run
by
their
*NL*
skill
and
their
coolness
over
my
inexperience
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
I
*NL*
must
leave
and
put
an
end
to
all
this
.
''
The
marquis
had
just
entrusted
*NL*
him
with
the
administration
of
a
number
of
small
estates
and
houses
*NL*
which
he
possessed
in
Lower
Languedoc
.
A
journey
was
necessary
;
M.
de
*NL*
la
Mole
reluctantly
consented
.
Julien
had
become
his
other
self
,
except
*NL*
in
those
matters
which
concerned
his
political
career
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
when
we
come
to
balance
the
account
,
''
Julien
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
as
he
prepared
his
departure
,
``
they
have
not
caught
me
.
Whether
the
*NL*
jests
that
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
made
to
those
gentlemen
are
real
,
*NL*
or
whether
they
were
only
intended
to
inspire
me
with
confidence
,
they
*NL*
have
simply
amused
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
no
conspiracy
against
the
carpenter
's
son
,
mademoiselle
de
*NL*
la
Mole
is
an
enigma
,
but
at
any
rate
,
she
is
quite
as
much
an
enigma
*NL*
for
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
as
she
is
to
me
.
Yesterday
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
her
bad
temper
was
very
real
,
and
I
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
*NL*
snub
,
thanks
to
her
favour
for
me
,
a
young
man
who
is
as
noble
and
as
*NL*
rich
as
I
am
a
poor
scoundrel
of
a
plebeian
.
That
is
my
finest
triumph
;
*NL*
it
will
divert
me
in
my
post-chaise
as
I
traverse
the
Languedoc
plains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
kept
his
departure
a
secret
,
but
Mathilde
knew
,
even
better
than
*NL*
he
did
himself
,
that
he
was
going
to
leave
Paris
the
following
day
for
*NL*
a
long
time
.
She
developed
a
maddening
headache
,
which
was
rendered
*NL*
worse
by
the
stuffy
salon
.
She
walked
a
great
deal
in
the
garden
,
and
*NL*
persecuted
Norbert
,
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
,
Caylus
,
de
Luz
,
and
*NL*
some
other
young
men
who
had
dined
at
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
,
to
such
an
*NL*
extent
by
her
mordant
witticisms
,
that
she
drove
them
to
take
their
*NL*
leave
.
She
kept
looking
at
Julien
in
a
strange
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
that
look
is
a
pose
,
''
thought
Julien
,
``
but
how
about
that
*NL*
hurried
breathing
and
all
that
agitation
?
Bah
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
who
am
I
to
judge
of
such
things
?
We
are
dealing
with
the
cream
of
*NL*
Parisian
sublimity
and
subtlety
.
As
for
that
hurried
breathing
which
*NL*
was
on
the
point
of
affecting
me
,
she
no
doubt
studied
it
with
Leontine
*NL*
Fay
,
whom
she
likes
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
left
alone
;
the
conversation
was
obviously
languishing
.
``
No
,
*NL*
Julien
has
no
feeling
for
me
,
''
said
Mathilde
to
herself
,
in
a
state
of
*NL*
real
unhappiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
taking
leave
of
her
she
took
his
arm
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
receive
a
letter
from
me
this
evening
,
''
she
said
to
him
in
a
*NL*
voice
that
was
so
changed
that
its
tone
was
scarcely
recognisable
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
circumstance
affected
Julien
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
,
''
she
continued
,
``
has
a
proper
regard
for
the
services
you
*NL*
render
him
.
You
must
not
leave
to-morrow
;
find
an
excuse
.
''
And
she
ran
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
figure
was
charming
.
It
was
impossible
to
have
a
prettier
foot
.
She
*NL*
ran
with
a
grace
which
fascinated
Julien
,
but
will
the
reader
guess
*NL*
what
he
began
to
think
about
after
she
had
finally
left
him
?
He
felt
*NL*
wounded
by
the
imperious
tone
with
which
she
had
said
the
words
,
``
you
*NL*
must
.
''
Louis
XV
.
too
,
when
on
his
death-bed
,
had
been
keenly
irritated
*NL*
by
the
words
``
you
must
,
''
which
had
been
tactlessly
pronounced
by
his
*NL*
first
physician
,
and
yet
Louis
XV
.
was
not
a
parvenu
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
afterwards
a
footman
gave
Julien
a
letter
.
It
was
quite
simply
*NL*
a
declaration
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
style
is
too
affected
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
,
as
he
endeavoured
*NL*
to
control
by
his
literary
criticism
the
joy
which
was
spreading
over
*NL*
his
cheeks
and
forcing
him
to
smile
in
spite
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
his
passionate
exultation
was
too
strong
to
be
controlled
.
``
So
*NL*
I
,
''
he
suddenly
exclaimed
,
``
I
,
the
poor
peasant
,
get
a
declaration
of
*NL*
love
from
a
great
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
myself
,
I
have
n't
done
so
badly
,
''
he
added
,
restraining
his
*NL*
joy
as
much
as
he
could
.
``
I
have
managed
to
preserve
my
self-respect
.
*NL*
I
did
not
say
that
I
loved
her
.
''
He
began
to
study
the
formation
of
*NL*
the
letters
.
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
had
a
pretty
little
English
*NL*
handwriting
.
He
needed
some
concrete
occupation
to
distract
him
from
a
*NL*
joy
which
verged
on
delirium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
departure
forces
me
to
speak
...
I
could
not
bear
not
to
see
you
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
thought
had
just
struck
Julien
like
a
new
discovery
.
It
interrupted
*NL*
his
examination
of
Mathilde
's
letter
,
and
redoubled
his
joy
.
``
So
I
*NL*
score
over
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Yes
,
I
who
could
*NL*
only
talk
seriously
!
And
he
is
so
handsome
.
He
has
a
moustache
and
a
*NL*
charming
uniform
.
He
always
manages
to
say
something
witty
and
clever
*NL*
just
at
the
psychological
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
experienced
a
delightful
minute
.
He
was
wandering
at
random
in
*NL*
the
garden
,
mad
with
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afterwards
he
went
up
to
his
desk
,
and
had
himself
ushered
in
to
the
*NL*
marquis
de
la
Mole
,
who
was
fortunately
still
in
.
He
showed
him
several
*NL*
stamped
papers
which
had
come
from
Normandy
,
and
had
no
difficulty
*NL*
in
convincing
him
that
he
was
obliged
to
put
off
his
departure
for
*NL*
Languedoc
in
order
to
look
after
the
Normandy
lawsuits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
that
you
are
not
going
,
''
said
the
marquis
to
him
,
when
*NL*
they
had
finished
talking
business
.
``
I
like
seeing
you
.
''
Julien
went
*NL*
out
;
the
words
irritated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
--
I
am
going
to
seduce
his
daughter
!
and
perhaps
render
*NL*
impossible
that
marriage
with
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
to
which
the
*NL*
marquis
looks
forward
with
such
delight
.
If
he
does
not
get
made
a
*NL*
duke
,
at
any
rate
his
daughter
will
have
a
coronet
.
''
Julien
thought
of
*NL*
leaving
for
Languedoc
in
spite
of
Mathilde
's
letter
,
and
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
explanation
he
had
just
given
to
the
marquis
.
This
flash
of
virtue
*NL*
quickly
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
kind
it
is
of
me
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
me
...
a
plebeian
,
takes
*NL*
pity
on
a
family
of
this
rank
!
Yes
,
me
,
whom
the
duke
of
Chaulnes
*NL*
calls
a
servant
!
How
does
the
marquis
manage
to
increase
his
immense
*NL*
fortune
?
By
selling
stock
when
he
picks
up
information
at
the
castle
*NL*
that
there
will
be
a
panic
of
a
_
coup
d'etat
_
on
the
following
day
.
*NL*
And
shall
I
,
who
have
been
flung
down
into
the
lowest
class
by
a
cruel
*NL*
providence
--
I
,
whom
providence
has
given
a
noble
heart
but
not
an
*NL*
income
of
a
thousand
francs
,
that
is
to
say
,
not
enough
to
buy
bread
*NL*
with
,
literally
not
enough
to
buy
bread
with
--
shall
I
refuse
a
pleasure
*NL*
that
presents
itself
?
A
limpid
fountain
which
will
quench
my
thirst
in
*NL*
this
scorching
desert
of
mediocrity
which
I
am
traversing
with
such
*NL*
difficulty
!
Upon
my
word
,
I
am
not
such
a
fool
!
Each
man
for
himself
in
*NL*
that
desert
of
egoism
which
is
called
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
remembered
certain
disdainful
looks
which
madame
de
la
Mole
,
and
*NL*
especially
her
lady
friends
,
had
favoured
him
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pleasure
of
scoring
over
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
completed
the
*NL*
rout
of
this
echo
of
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
should
like
to
make
him
angry
,
''
said
Julien
.
``
With
what
*NL*
confidence
would
I
give
him
a
sword
thrust
now
!
''
And
he
went
through
*NL*
the
segoon
thrust
.
``
Up
till
now
I
have
been
a
mere
usher
,
who
exploited
*NL*
basely
the
little
courage
he
had
.
After
this
letter
I
am
his
equal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
slowly
said
to
himself
,
with
an
infinite
pleasure
,
``
the
*NL*
merits
of
the
marquis
and
myself
have
been
weighed
in
the
balance
,
and
*NL*
it
is
the
poor
carpenter
from
the
Jura
who
turns
the
scale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
this
is
how
I
shall
sign
my
answer
.
Do
n't
*NL*
imagine
,
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
that
I
am
forgetting
my
place
.
I
will
*NL*
make
you
realise
and
fully
appreciate
that
it
is
for
a
carpenter
's
son
*NL*
that
you
are
betraying
a
descendant
of
the
famous
Guy
de
Croisenois
who
*NL*
followed
St.
Louis
to
the
Crusade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
unable
to
control
his
joy
.
He
was
obliged
to
go
down
into
*NL*
the
garden
.
He
had
locked
himself
in
his
room
,
but
he
found
it
too
*NL*
narrow
to
breathe
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
of
it
being
me
,
the
poor
peasant
from
the
Jura
,
''
he
kept
*NL*
on
repeating
to
himself
,
``
to
think
of
it
being
me
who
am
eternally
*NL*
condemned
to
wear
this
gloomy
black
suit
!
Alas
twenty
years
ago
I
would
*NL*
have
worn
a
uniform
like
they
do
!
In
those
days
a
man
like
me
either
*NL*
got
killed
or
became
a
general
at
thirty-six
.
The
letter
which
he
held
*NL*
clenched
in
his
hand
gave
him
a
heroic
pose
and
stature
.
Nowadays
,
it
*NL*
is
true
,
if
one
sticks
to
this
black
suit
,
one
gets
at
forty
an
income
*NL*
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
and
the
blue
ribbon
like
my
lord
bishop
of
*NL*
Beauvais
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
to
himself
with
a
Mephistophelian
smile
,
``
I
have
more
*NL*
brains
than
they
.
I
am
shrewd
enough
to
choose
the
uniform
of
my
*NL*
century
.
And
he
felt
a
quickening
of
his
ambition
and
of
his
attachment
*NL*
to
his
ecclesiastical
dress
.
What
cardinals
of
even
lower
birth
than
*NL*
mine
have
not
succeeded
in
governing
!
My
compatriot
Granvelle
,
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
agitation
became
gradually
calmed
!
Prudence
emerged
to
the
*NL*
top
.
He
said
to
himself
like
his
master
Tartuffe
whose
part
he
knew
by
*NL*
heart
:

''
he
*NL*
added
pronouncing
his
words
slowly
with
an
intonation
of
deliberate
and
*NL*
restrained
ferocity
.
``
We
will
begin
by
quoting
the

*NL*
``

``

exclaimed
getting
up
impetuously
!
``

With
these
words
*NL*
his
gratitude
to
M.
de
la
Mole
,
which
had
been
in
spite
of
himself
*NL*
torturing
his
conscience
up
to
this
time
,
breathed
its
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Softly

Machiavellian

not
have
done
better

will
take

``
One

incorruptible

Yes

I
must
send

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
admit
that
Julien
's
expression
was
awful
,
his
countenance
*NL*
ghastly
;
it
breathed
unmitigated
criminality
.
It
represented
the
*NL*
unhappy
man
at
war
with
all
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
arms

''
exclaimed
Julien
.
And
he
bounded
up
the
flight
of
steps
*NL*
of
the
hotel
with
one
stride
.
He
entered
the
stall
of
the
street
*NL*
scrivener
;
he
frightened
him
.
``
Copy
this
,
''
he
said
,
giving
him
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
scrivener
was
working
,
he
himself
wrote
to
Fouque
.
He
asked
*NL*
him
to
take
care
of
a
valuable
deposit
.
``
But
he
said
to
himself
,
''
*NL*
breaking
in
upon
his
train
of
thought
,
``
the
secret
service
of
the
*NL*
post-office
will
open
my
letter

will
give
you

the
one

you
are
looking
for

not
quite

''
He
went
and
bought
an
*NL*
enormous
Bible
from
a
Protestant
bookseller
,
skillfully
hid
Mathilde
's
*NL*
letter
in
the
cover
,
and
packed
it
all
up
.
His
parcel
left
by
the
*NL*
diligence
addressed
to
one
of
Fouque
's
workmen
,
whose
name
was
known
to
*NL*
nobody
at
Paris

*NL*
*NL*
This
done
,
he
returned
to
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
,
joyous
and
buoyant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
's
our
turn
he
exclaimed
as
he
locked
himself
into
the
room
and
*NL*
threw
off
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

wrote
to
Mathilde

flattering

carpenter

make

And
he
copied
out
the
most
explicit
phrases
in
*NL*
the
letter
which
he
had
just
received

His
own

would
have
done

honour

the
diplomatic
prudence
of
M.
the
Chevalier
de

*NL*
It
was
still
only
ten
o'clock
when
Julien
entered
the
Italian
opera
,
*NL*
intoxicated
with
happiness
and
that
feeling
of
his
own
power
which
was
*NL*
so
novel
for
a
poor
devil
like
him

He
heard

A

What
perplexity
!
What
sleepless
nights
!
Great
God
.
Am
I
*NL*
going
to
make
myself
contemptible

He
will
despise

But
he
is

_
Alfred
de
Musset
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
had
not
written
without
a
struggle
.
Whatever
might
have
been
*NL*
the
beginning
of
her
interest
in
Julien
,
it
soon
dominated
that
pride
*NL*
which
had
reigned
unchallenged
in
her
heart
since
she
had
begun
to
know
*NL*
herself
.
This
cold
and
haughty
soul
was
swept
away
for
the
first
time
*NL*
by
a
sentiment
of
passion
,
but
if
this
passion
dominated
her
pride
,
*NL*
it
still
kept
faithfully
to
the
habits
of
that
pride
.
Two
months
of
*NL*
struggles
and
new
sensations
had
transformed
,
so
to
speak
her
whole
*NL*
moral
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
thought
she
was
in
sight
of
happiness
.
This
vista
,
*NL*
irresistible
as
it
is
for
those
who
combine
a
superior
intellect
with
*NL*
a
courageous
soul
,
had
to
struggle
for
a
long
time
against
her
self
*NL*
respect
and
all
her
vulgar
duties
.
One
day
she
went
into
her
mother
's
*NL*
room
at
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
asked
permission
to
take
*NL*
refuge
in
Villequier
.
The
marquise
did
not
even
deign
to
answer
her
,
*NL*
and
advised
her
to
go
back
to
bed
.
This
was
the
last
effort
of
vulgar
*NL*
prudence
and
respect
for
tradition
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fear
of
doing
wrong
and
of
offending
those
ideas
which
the
*NL*
Caylus
's
,
the
de
Luz
's
,
the
Croisenois
'
held
for
sacred
had
little
*NL*
power
over
her
soul
.
She
considered
such
creatures
incapable
of
*NL*
understanding
her
.
She
would
have
consulted
them
,
if
it
had
been
a
*NL*
matter
of
buying
a
carriage
or
an
estate
.
Her
real
fear
was
that
Julien
*NL*
was
displeased
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
,
too
,
has
only
the
appearance
of
a
superior
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
abhorred
lack
of
character
;
that
was
her
one
objection
to
the
*NL*
handsome
young
men
who
surrounded
her
.
The
more
they
made
elegant
*NL*
fun
of
everything
which
deviated
from
the
prevailing
mode
,
or
which
*NL*
conformed
to
it
but
indifferently
,
the
lower
they
fell
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
brave
and
that
was
all
.
``
And
after
all
in
what
way
were
they
*NL*
brave
?
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
In
duels
,
but
the
duel
is
nothing
more
*NL*
than
a
formality
.
The
whole
thing
is
mapped
out
beforehand
,
even
the
*NL*
correct
thing
to
say
when
you
fall

Stretched
on
the
turf
,
and
with
*NL*
your
hand
on
your
heart

you
must
vouchsafe
a
generous
forgiveness
to
*NL*
the
adversary

a
few
words
for
a
fair
lady
,
who
is
often
imaginary
,
*NL*
or
if
she
does
exist
,
will
go
to
a
ball
on
the
day
of
your
death
for
*NL*
fear
of
arousing
suspicion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
braves
danger
at
the
head
of
a
squadron
brilliant
with
steel
,
but
*NL*
how
about
that
danger
which
is
solitary
,
strange
,
unforeseen
and
really
*NL*
ugly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
said
Mathilde
to
herself
,
``
it
was
at
the
court
of
Henri
III
.
*NL*
that
men
who
were
great
both
by
character
and
by
birth
were
to
be
*NL*
found
!
Yes
!
If
Julien
had
served
at
Jarnac
or
Moncontour
,
I
should
no
*NL*
longer
doubt
.
In
those
days
of
strength
and
vigour
Frenchmen
were
not
*NL*
dolls
.
The
day
of
the
battle
was
almost
the
one
which
presented
the
*NL*
fewest
problems
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
life
was
not
imprisoned
,
like
an
Egyptian
mummy
in
a
covering
*NL*
which
was
common
to
all
,
and
always
the
same
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
added
,
``
there
*NL*
was
more
real
courage
in
going
home
alone
at
eleven
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
evening
when
one
came
out
of
the
Hotel
de
Soissons
where
Catherine
*NL*
de
'
Medici
lived
than
there
is
nowadays
in
running
over
to
Algiers
.
*NL*
A
man
's
life
was
then
a
series
of
hazards
.
Nowadays
civilisation
has
*NL*
banished
hazard
.
There
are
no
more
surprises
.
If
anything
new
appears
*NL*
in
any
idea
there
are
not
sufficient
epigrams
to
immortalise
it
,
but
if
*NL*
anything
new
appears
in
actual
life
,
our
panic
reaches
the
lowest
depth
*NL*
of
cowardice
.
Whatever
folly
panic
makes
us
commit
is
excused
.
What
a
*NL*
degenerate
and
boring
age
!
What
would
Boniface
de
la
Mole
have
said
*NL*
if
,
lifting
his
cut-off
head
out
of
the
tomb
,
he
had
seen
seventeen
of
*NL*
his
descendants
allow
themselves
to
be
caught
like
sheep
in
1793
in
*NL*
order
to
be
guillotined
two
days
afterwards
!
Death
was
certain
,
but
it
*NL*
would
have
been
bad
form
to
have
defended
themselves
and
to
have
killed
*NL*
at
least
one
or
two
Jacobins
.
Yes
!
in
the
heroic
days
of
France
,
in
*NL*
the
age
of
Boniface
de
la
Mole
,
Julien
would
have
been
the
chief
of
*NL*
a
squadron
,
while
my
brother
would
have
been
the
young
priest
with
*NL*
decorous
manners
,
with
wisdom
in
his
eyes
and
reason
on
his
lips
.
''
Some
*NL*
months
previously
Mathilde
had
given
up
all
hope
of
meeting
any
being
*NL*
who
was
a
little
different
from
the
common
pattern
.
She
had
found
some
*NL*
happiness
in
allowing
herself
to
write
to
some
young
society
men
.
This
*NL*
rash
procedure
,
which
was
so
unbecoming
and
so
imprudent
in
a
young
*NL*
girl
,
might
have
disgraced
her
in
the
eyes
of
M.
de
Croisenois
,
the
*NL*
Duke
de
Chaulnes
,
his
father
,
and
the
whole
Hotel
de
Chaulnes
,
who
on
*NL*
seeing
the
projected
marriage
broken
off
would
have
wanted
to
know
the
*NL*
reason
.
At
that
time
Mathilde
had
been
unable
to
sleep
on
those
days
*NL*
when
she
had
written
one
of
her
letters
.
But
those
letters
were
only
*NL*
answers
.
But
now
she
ventured
to
declare
her
own
love
.
She
wrote
first
*NL*
-LRB-
what
a
terrible
word
!
-RRB-
to
a
man
of
the
lowest
social
grade
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
circumstance
rendered
her
eternal
disgrace
quite
inevitable
in
the
*NL*
event
of
detection
.
Who
of
the
women
who
visited
her
mother
would
have
*NL*
dared
to
take
her
part
?
What
official
excuse
could
be
evolved
which
*NL*
could
successfully
cope
with
the
awful
contempt
of
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
speaking
was
awful
enough
,
but
writing
!
``
There
are
some
*NL*
things
which
are
not
written
!
''
Napoleon
had
exclaimed
on
learning
of
*NL*
the
capitulation
of
Baylen
.
And
it
was
Julien
who
had
told
her
that
*NL*
epigram
,
as
though
giving
her
a
lesson
that
was
to
come
in
useful
*NL*
subsequently
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
was
comparatively
unimportant
,
Mathilde
's
anguish
had
*NL*
other
causes
.
Forgetting
the
terrible
effect
it
would
produce
on
*NL*
society
,
and
the
ineffable
blot
on
her
scutcheon
that
would
follow
such
*NL*
an
outrage
on
her
own
caste
,
Mathilde
was
going
to
write
to
a
person
*NL*
of
a
very
different
character
to
the
Croisenois
'
,
the
de
Luz
's
,
the
*NL*
Caylus
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
have
been
frightened
at
the
depth
and
mystery
in
Julien
's
*NL*
character
,
even
if
she
had
merely
entered
into
a
conventional
*NL*
acquaintance
with
him
.
And
she
was
going
to
make
him
her
lover
,
perhaps
*NL*
her
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
his
pretensions
not
be
,
if
he
is
ever
in
a
position
to
do
*NL*
everything
with
me
?
Well
!
I
shall
say
,
like
Medea
:
_
Au
milieu
de
tant
*NL*
de
perils
il
me
reste
Moi
_
.
''
She
believed
that
Julien
had
no
respect
*NL*
for
nobility
of
blood
.
What
was
more
,
he
probably
did
not
love
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
these
last
moments
of
awful
doubt
her
feminine
pride
suggested
to
*NL*
her
certain
ideas
.
``
Everything
is
bound
to
be
extraordinary
in
the
life
*NL*
of
a
girl
like
me
,
''
exclaimed
Mathilde
impatiently
.
The
pride
,
which
*NL*
had
been
drilled
into
her
since
her
cradle
,
began
to
struggle
with
her
*NL*
virtue
.
It
was
at
this
moment
that
Julien
's
departure
precipitated
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Such
characters
are
luckily
very
rare
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Very
late
in
the
evening
,
Julien
was
malicious
enough
to
have
a
very
*NL*
heavy
trunk
taken
down
to
the
porter
's
lodge
.
He
called
the
valet
,
who
*NL*
was
courting
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
chambermaid
,
to
move
it
.
``
This
*NL*
manoeuvre
can
not
result
in
anything
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
but
if
it
*NL*
does
succeed
,
she
will
think
that
I
have
gone
.
''
Very
tickled
by
this
*NL*
humorous
thought
,
he
fell
asleep
.
Mathilde
did
not
sleep
a
wink
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
left
the
hotel
very
early
the
next
morning
without
being
seen
,
*NL*
but
he
came
back
before
eight
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
scarcely
entered
the
library
before
M.
de
la
Mole
appeared
*NL*
on
the
threshold
.
He
handed
her
his
answer
.
He
thought
that
it
was
*NL*
his
duty
to
speak
to
her
,
it
was
certainly
perfectly
feasible
,
but
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
would
not
listen
to
him
and
disappeared
.
Julien
*NL*
was
delighted
.
He
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
all
this
is
not
a
put
up
job
with
comte
Norbert
,
it
is
clear
that
*NL*
it
is
my
cold
looks
which
have
kindled
the
strange
love
which
this
*NL*
aristocratic
girl
chooses
to
entertain
for
me
.
I
should
be
really
*NL*
too
much
of
a
fool
if
I
ever
allowed
myself
to
take
a
fancy
to
that
*NL*
big
blonde
doll
.
''
This
train
of
reasoning
left
him
colder
and
more
*NL*
calculating
than
he
had
ever
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
battle
for
which
we
are
preparing
,
''
he
added
,
``
pride
of
birth
*NL*
will
be
like
a
high
hill
which
constitutes
a
military
position
between
*NL*
her
and
me
.
That
must
be
the
field
of
the
manoeuvres
.
I
made
a
great
*NL*
mistake
in
staying
in
Paris
;
this
postponing
of
my
departure
cheapens
*NL*
and
exposes
me
,
if
all
this
is
simply
a
trick
.
What
danger
was
there
in
*NL*
leaving
?
If
they
were
making
fun
of
me
,
I
was
making
fun
of
them
.
If
*NL*
her
interest
for
me
was
in
any
way
real
,
I
was
making
that
interest
a
*NL*
hundred
times
more
intense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
letter
had
given
Julien
's
vanity
so
keen
a
*NL*
pleasure
,
that
wreathed
as
he
was
in
smiles
at
his
good
fortune
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
to
think
seriously
about
the
propriety
of
leaving
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
the
fatal
elements
of
his
character
to
be
extremely
*NL*
sensitive
to
his
own
weaknesses
.
He
was
extremely
upset
by
this
one
,
*NL*
and
had
almost
forgotten
the
incredible
victory
which
had
preceded
this
*NL*
slight
check
,
when
about
nine
o'clock
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
appeared
*NL*
on
the
threshold
of
the
library
,
flung
him
a
letter
and
ran
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
this
is
going
to
be
the
romance
by
letters
,
''
he
said
as
he
picked
*NL*
it
up
.
``
The
enemy
makes
a
false
move
;
I
will
reply
by
coldness
and
*NL*
virtue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
asked
with
a
poignancy
which
merely
increased
his
inner
gaiety
*NL*
to
give
a
definite
answer
.
He
indulged
in
the
pleasure
of
mystifying
*NL*
those
persons
who
he
thought
wanted
to
make
fun
of
him
for
two
pages
,
*NL*
and
it
was
out
of
humour
again
that
he
announced
towards
the
end
of
his
*NL*
answer
his
definite
departure
on
the
following
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
garden
will
be
a
useful
place
to
hand
her
the
letter
,
''
he
thought
*NL*
after
he
had
finished
it
,
and
he
went
there
.
He
looked
at
the
window
of
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
first
storey
,
next
to
her
mother
's
apartment
,
but
there
*NL*
was
a
large
ground
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
latter
was
so
high
that
,
as
Julien
walked
under
the
avenue
*NL*
of
pines
with
his
letter
in
his
hands
,
he
could
not
be
seen
from
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
window
.
The
dome
formed
by
the
well
clipped
*NL*
pines
intercepted
the
view
.
``
What
!
''
said
Julien
to
himself
angrily
,
*NL*
``
another
indiscretion
!
If
they
have
really
begun
making
fun
of
me
,
*NL*
showing
myself
with
a
letter
is
playing
into
my
enemy
's
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Norbert
's
room
was
exactly
above
his
sister
's
and
if
Julien
came
out
*NL*
from
under
the
dome
formed
by
the
clipped
branches
of
the
pine
,
the
*NL*
comte
and
his
friend
could
follow
all
his
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
appeared
behind
her
window
;
he
half
showed
his
*NL*
letter
;
she
lowered
her
head
,
then
Julien
ran
up
to
his
own
room
and
*NL*
met
accidentally
on
the
main
staircase
the
fair
Mathilde
,
who
seized
*NL*
the
letter
with
complete
self-possession
and
smiling
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
passion
there
was
in
the
eyes
of
that
poor
madame
de
Renal
,
''
said
*NL*
Julien
to
himself
,
``
when
she
ventured
to
receive
a
letter
from
me
,
*NL*
even
after
six
months
of
intimate
relationship
!
I
do
n't
think
she
ever
*NL*
looked
at
me
with
smiling
eyes
in
her
whole
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
formulate
so
precisely
the
rest
of
his
answer
;
was
he
*NL*
perhaps
ashamed
of
the
triviality
of
the
motive
which
were
actuating
*NL*
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
different
too
,
''
he
went
on
to
think
,
``
are
her
elegant
morning
*NL*
dress
and
her
distinguished
appearance
!
A
man
of
taste
on
seeing
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
thirty
yards
off
would
infer
the
position
which
*NL*
she
occupies
in
society
.
That
is
what
can
be
called
a
specific
merit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
this
humorousness
,
Julien
was
not
yet
quite
honest
with
*NL*
himself
;
madame
de
Renal
had
no
marquis
de
Croisenois
to
sacrifice
to
*NL*
him
.
His
only
rival
was
that
grotesque
sub-prefect
,
M.
Charcot
,
who
*NL*
assumed
the
name
of
Maugiron
,
because
there
were
no
Maugirons
left
in
*NL*
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
five
o'clock
Julien
received
a
third
letter
.
It
was
thrown
to
him
*NL*
from
the
library
door
.
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
ran
away
again
.
``
What
*NL*
a
mania
for
writing
,
''
he
said
to
himself
with
a
laugh
,
``
when
one
can
*NL*
talk
so
easily
.
The
enemy
wants
my
letters
,
that
is
clear
,
and
many
of
*NL*
them
.
''
He
did
not
hurry
to
open
this
one
.
``
More
elegant
phrases
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
;
but
he
paled
as
he
read
it
.
There
were
only
eight
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
to
speak
to
you

speak

the
moment

one
o'clock
is
striking

Take
the

ladder
near
the
well

place
it
against

up
to

It
is

CHAPTER
XLV
*NL*
*NL*
IS
IT
A
PLOT
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
how
cruel
is
the
interval
between
the
conception
*NL*
and
the
execution
of
a
great
project
.
What
vain
fears
,
*NL*
what
fits
of
irresolution
!
It
is
a
matter
of
life
and

death

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
getting
serious

thought
Julien
,
``
and
a
little
too
clear
,
''
*NL*
he
added
after
thinking
a
little
.
``
Why
to
be
sure
!
This
fine
young
*NL*
lady
can
talk
to
me
in
the
library
with
a
freedom
which
,
thank
heaven
,
*NL*
is
absolutely
complete
;
the
marquis

frightened
as
he
is
that
I
show

never

M.
de

Norbert

the
only
persons
who
ever
come
here

are
absent
nearly
the
*NL*
whole
day
,
and
the
sublime
Mathilde
for
whom
a
sovereign
prince
*NL*
would
not
be
too
noble
a
suitor
,
wants
me
to
commit
an
abominable

*NL*
``
It
is
clear
they
want

First
they
wanted
to

to
be
*NL*
discreet
;
well
,
they
want
some
act
which
is
clearer
than
daylight
.
*NL*
These
handsome
little
gentlemen
think
I
am
too
silly
or
too
conceited
.
*NL*
The
devil
!
To
think
of
climbing
like
this
up
a
ladder
to
a
storey
*NL*
twenty-five
feet
high
in
the
finest
moonlight
.
They
would
have
time
to
*NL*
see
me
,
even
from
the
neighbouring
houses
.
I
shall
cut
a
pretty
figure
*NL*
to
be
sure
on
my
ladder
!
''
Julien
went
up
to
his
room
again
and
began
*NL*
to
pack
his
trunk
whistling
.
He
had
decided
to
leave
and
not
even
to
*NL*
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
wise
resolution
did
not
give
him
peace
of
mind
.
``
If
by
*NL*
chance
,
''
he
suddenly
said
to
himself
after
he
had
closed
his
trunk
,
*NL*
``
Mathilde
is
in
good
faith
,
why
then
I
cut
the
figure
of
an
arrant
*NL*
coward
in
her
eyes
.
I
have
no
birth
myself
,
so
I
need
great
qualities
*NL*
attested
straight
away
by
speaking
actions
--
money
down
--
no
charitable
*NL*
credit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spent
a
quarter-of-an-hour
in
reflecting
.
``
What
is
the
good
of
*NL*
denying
it
?
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
She
will
think
me
a
coward
.
I
shall
lose
*NL*
not
only
the
most
brilliant
person
in
high
society
,
as
they
all
said
at
*NL*
M.
the
duke
de
Retz
's
ball
,
but
also
the
heavenly
pleasure
of
seeing
*NL*
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
,
the
son
of
a
duke
,
who
will
be
one
day
a
*NL*
duke
himself
,
sacrificed
to
me
.
A
charming
young
man
who
has
all
the
*NL*
qualities
I
lack
.
A
happy
wit
,
birth
,
fortune
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
regret
will
haunt
me
all
my
life
,
not
on
her
account
,
`
there
are
*NL*
so
many
mistresses
!
...
but
there
is
only
one
honour
!
'
says
old
don
*NL*
Diego
.
And
here
am
I
clearly
and
palpably
shrinking
from
the
first
*NL*
danger
that
presents
itself
;
for
the
duel
with
M.
de
Beauvoisis
was
*NL*
simply
a
joke
.
This
is
quite
different
.
A
servant
may
fire
at
me
point
*NL*
blank
,
but
that
is
the
least
danger
;
I
may
be
disgraced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
getting
serious
,
my
boy
,
''
he
added
with
a
Gascon
gaiety
and
*NL*
accent
.
``
Honour
is
at
stake
.
A
poor
devil
flung
by
chance
into
as
low
a
*NL*
grade
as
I
am
will
never
find
such
an
opportunity
again
.
I
shall
have
*NL*
my
conquests
,
but
they
will
be
inferior
ones
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
reflected
for
a
long
time
,
he
walked
up
and
down
hurriedly
,
and
*NL*
then
from
time
to
time
would
suddenly
stop
.
A
magnificent
marble
bust
*NL*
of
cardinal
de
Richelieu
had
been
placed
in
his
room
.
It
attracted
his
*NL*
gaze
in
spite
of
himself
.
This
bust
seemed
to
look
at
him
severely
as
*NL*
though
reproaching
him
with
the
lack
of
that
audacity
which
ought
to
be
*NL*
so
natural
to
the
French
character
.
``
Would
I
have
hesitated
in
your
age
*NL*
great
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
worst
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
,
``
suppose
all
this
is
a
trap
,
*NL*
it
is
pretty
black
and
pretty
compromising
for
a
young
girl
.
They
know
*NL*
that
I
am
not
the
man
to
hold
my
tongue
.
They
will
therefore
have
to
*NL*
kill
me
.
That
was
right
enough
in
1574
in
the
days
of
Boniface
de
la
*NL*
Mole
,
but
nobody
today
would
ever
have
the
pluck
.
They
are
not
the
same
*NL*
men
.
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
is
the
object
of
so
much
jealousy
.
Four
*NL*
hundred
salons
would
ring
with
her
disgrace
to-morrow
,
and
how
pleased
*NL*
they
would
all
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
servants
gossip
among
themselves
about
marked
the
favours
of
*NL*
which
I
am
the
recipient
.
I
know
it
,
I
have
heard
them
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
other
hand
they
're
her
letters
.
They
may
think
that
I
have
*NL*
them
on
me
.
They
may
surprise
me
in
her
room
and
take
them
from
me
.
I
*NL*
shall
have
to
deal
with
two
,
three
,
or
four
men
.
How
can
I
tell
?
But
*NL*
where
are
they
going
to
find
these
men
?
Where
are
they
to
find
discreet
*NL*
subordinates
in
Paris
?
Justice
frightens
them
...
By
God
!
It
may
be
the
*NL*
Caylus
's
,
the
Croisenois
'
,
the
de
Luz
's
themselves
.
The
idea
of
the
*NL*
ludicrous
figure
I
should
cut
in
the
middle
of
them
at
the
particular
*NL*
minute
may
have
attracted
them
.
Look
out
for
the
fate
of
Abelard
,
M.
*NL*
the
secretary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
by
heaven
,
I
'll
mark
you

I
'll
strike
at
your
faces
like
Caesar
's
*NL*
soldiers
at
Pharsalia
.
As
for
the
letters
,
I
can
put
them
in
a
safe
*NL*
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
copied
out
the
two
last
,
hid
them
in
a
fine
volume
of
Voltaire
*NL*
in
the
library
and
himself
took
the
originals
to
the
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
folly
am
I
going
to
rush
into
,
''
he
said
to
himself
with
surprise
*NL*
and
terror
when
he
returned
.
He
had
been
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
*NL*
contemplating
what
he
was
to
do
on
this
coming
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
refuse
,
I
am
bound
to
despise
myself
afterwards
.
This
matter
*NL*
will
always
occasion
me
great
doubt
during
my
whole
life
,
and
to
a
man
*NL*
like
me
such
doubts
are
the
most
poignant
unhappiness
.
Did
I
not
feel
*NL*
like
that
for
Amanda
's
lover
!
I
think
I
would
find
it
easier
to
forgive
*NL*
myself
for
a
perfectly
clear
crime
;
once
admitted
,
I
could
leave
off
*NL*
thinking
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
I
shall
have
been
the
rival
of
a
man
who
bears
one
of
the
finest
*NL*
names
in
France
,
and
then
out
of
pure
light-heartedness
,
declared
*NL*
myself
his
inferior
!
After
all
,
it
is
cowardly
not
to
go
;
these
words
*NL*
clinch
everything
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
as
he
got
up
...
``
besides
she
is
*NL*
quite
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
is
not
a
piece
of
treachery
,
what
a
folly
is
she
not
*NL*
committing
for
my
sake

If
it
's
a
piece
of
mystification
,
by
heaven
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
it
only
depends
on
me
to
turn
the
jest
into
earnest
and
that
*NL*
I
will
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
supposing
they
tie
my
hands
together
at
the
moment
I
enter
the
*NL*
room
:
they
may
have
placed
some
ingenious
machine
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
like
a
duel
,
''
he
said
to
himself
with
a
laugh
.
``
Everyone
makes
*NL*
a
full
parade

says
my
_
maitre
d'armes
_
,
but
the
good
God

who
wishes
*NL*
the
thing
to
end
,
makes
one
of
them
forget
to
parry
.
Besides
,
here
's
*NL*
something
to
answer
them
with
.
''
He
drew
his
pistols
out
of
his
pocket
,
*NL*
and
although
the
priming
was
shining
,
he
renewed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
still
several
hours
to
wait
.
Julien
wrote
to
Fouque
in
order
*NL*
to
have
something
to
do
.
``
My
friend
,
do
not
open
the
enclosed
letter
*NL*
except
in
the
event
of
an
accident
,
if
you
hear
that
something
strange
*NL*
has
happened
to
me

In
that
case
blot
out
the
proper
names
in
the
*NL*
manuscript
which
I
am
sending
you

make
eight
copies
of
it

and
send
*NL*
it
to
the
papers

Marseilles
,
Bordeaux
,
Lyons

Brussels
,
etc.

Ten
*NL*
days
later
have
the
manuscript
printed

send
the
first
copy
to
M.
the
*NL*
marquis
de
la
Mole
,
and
a
fortnight
after
that
throw
the
other
copies
*NL*
at
night
into
the
streets
of
Verrieres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
made
this
little
memoir
in
defence
of
his
position
as
little
*NL*
compromising
as
possible
for
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
Fouque
was
only
*NL*
to
open
it
in
the
event
of
an
accident
.
It
was
put
in
the
form
of
a
*NL*
story
,
but
in
fact
it
exactly
described
his
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
just
fastened
his
packet
when
the
dinner
bell
rang
.
It
made
*NL*
his
heart
beat
.
His
imagination
was
distracted
by
the
story
which
he
*NL*
had
just
composed
,
and
fell
a
prey
to
tragic
presentiments
.
He
saw
*NL*
himself
seized
by
servants
,
trussed
,
and
taken
into
a
cellar
with
a
gag
*NL*
in
his
mouth
.
A
servant
was
stationed
there
,
who
never
let
him
out
of
*NL*
sight
,
and
if
the
family
honour
required
that
the
adventure
should
have
*NL*
a
tragic
end
,
it
was
easy
to
finish
everything
with
those
poisons
which
*NL*
leave
no
trace
.
They
could
then
say
that
he
had
died
of
an
illness
and
*NL*
would
carry
his
dead
body
back
into
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thrilled
like
a
dramatic
author
by
his
own
story
,
Julien
was
really
*NL*
afraid
when
he
entered
the
dining-room
.
He
looked
at
all
those
liveried
*NL*
servants
--
he
studied
their
faces
.
``
Which
ones
are
chosen
for
to-night
's
*NL*
expedition
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
The
memories
of
the
court
of
Henri
*NL*
III
.
are
so
vivid
in
this
family
,
and
so
often
recalled
,
that
if
they
*NL*
think
they
have
been
insulted
they
will
show
more
resolution
than
other
*NL*
persons
of
the
same
rank
.
''
He
looked
at
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
in
*NL*
order
to
read
the
family
plans
in
her
eyes
;
she
was
pale
and
looked
*NL*
quite
middle-aged
.
He
thought
that
she
had
never
looked
so
great
:
she
*NL*
was
really
handsome
and
imposing
;
he
almost
fell
in
love
with
her
.
*NL*
''
_
Pallida
morte
futura
_
,
''
he
said
to
himself
-LRB-
her
pallor
indicates
*NL*
her
great
plans
-RRB-
.
It
was
in
vain
that
after
dinner
he
made
a
point
of
*NL*
walking
for
a
long
time
in
the
garden
,
mademoiselle
did
not
appear
.
*NL*
Speaking
to
her
at
that
moment
would
have
lifted
a
great
weight
off
his
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
not
admit
it
?
he
was
afraid
.
As
he
had
resolved
to
act
,
he
was
not
*NL*
ashamed
to
abandon
himself
to
this
emotion
.
``
So
long
as
I
show
the
*NL*
necessary
courage
at
the
actual
moment
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
what
*NL*
does
it
matter
what
I
feel
at
this
particular
moment
?
''
He
went
to
*NL*
reconnoitre
the
situation
and
find
out
the
weight
of
the
ladder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
an
instrument
,
''
he
said
to
himself
with
a
smile
,
``
which
I
am
*NL*
fated
to
use
both
here
and
at
Verrieres
.
What
a
difference
!
In
those
*NL*
days
,
''
he
added
with
a
sigh
,
``
I
was
not
obliged
to
distrust
the
person
*NL*
for
whom
I
exposed
myself
to
danger
.
What
a
difference
also
in
the
*NL*
danger
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
would
have
been
no
dishonour
for
me
if
I
had
been
killed
in
M.
*NL*
de
Renal
's
gardens
.
It
would
have
been
easy
to
have
made
my
death
into
*NL*
a
mystery
.
But
here
all
kinds
of
abominable
scandal
will
be
talked
in
*NL*
the
salons
of
the
Hotel
de
Chaulnes
,
the
Hotel
de
Caylus
,
de
Retz
,
*NL*
etc.
,
everywhere
in
fact
.
I
shall
go
down
to
posterity
as
a
monster
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
two
or
three
years
,
''
he
went
on
with
a
laugh
,
making
fun
of
*NL*
himself
;
but
the
idea
paralysed
him
.
``
And
how
am
I
going
to
manage
to
*NL*
get
justified
?
Suppose
that
Fouque
does
print
my
posthumous
pamphlet
,
*NL*
it
will
only
be
taken
for
an
additional
infamy
.
Why
!
I
get
received
*NL*
into
a
house
,
and
I
reward
the
hospitality
which
I
have
received
,
*NL*
the
kindness
with
which
I
have
been
loaded
by
printing
a
pamphlet
*NL*
about
what
has
happened
and
attacking
the
honour
of
women
!
Nay
!
I
'd
a
*NL*
thousand
times
rather
be
duped

evening
was

CHAPTER
XLVI
*NL*
*NL*
ONE
O'CLOCK
IN
THE
MORNING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
garden
was
very
big
,
it
had
been
planned
a
*NL*
few
years
ago
in
perfect
taste
.
But
the
trees
were
*NL*
more
than
a
century
old
.
It
had
a
certain
rustic
*NL*
atmosphere
.
--
_
Massinger
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
going
to
write
a
countermanding
letter
to
Fouque
when
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
struck
.
He
noisily
turned
the
lock
of
the
door
of
his
room
as
*NL*
though
he
had
locked
himself
in
.
He
went
with
a
sleuth-like
step
to
*NL*
observe
what
was
happening
over
the
house
,
especially
on
the
fourth
*NL*
storey
where
the
servants
slept
.
There
was
nothing
unusual
.
One
of
*NL*
madame
de
la
Mole
's
chambermaids
was
giving
an
entertainment
,
the
*NL*
servants
were
taking
punch
with
much
gaiety
.
``
Those
who
laugh
like
*NL*
that
,
''
thought
Julien
,
``
can
not
be
participating
in
the
nocturnal
*NL*
expedition
;
if
they
were
,
they
would
be
more
serious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eventually
he
stationed
himself
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
garden
.
``
If
*NL*
their
plan
is
to
hide
themselves
from
the
servants
of
the
house
,
they
*NL*
will
despatch
the
persons
whom
they
have
told
off
to
surprise
me
over
*NL*
the
garden
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
M.
de
Croisenois
shows
any
sense
of
proportion
in
this
matter
,
he
*NL*
is
bound
to
find
it
less
compromising
for
the
young
person
,
whom
he
*NL*
wishes
to
make
his
wife
if
he
has
me
surprised
before
I
enter
her
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
military
and
extremely
detailed
reconnaissance
.
``
My
honour
is
*NL*
at
stake
,
''
he
thought
.
``
If
I
tumble
into
some
pitfall
it
will
not
be
an
*NL*
excuse
in
my
own
eyes
to
say
,
'
I
never
thought
of
it
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
weather
was
desperately
serene
.
About
eleven
o'clock
the
moon
rose
,
*NL*
at
half-past
twelve
it
completely
illuminated
the
facade
of
the
hotel
*NL*
looking
out
upon
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
mad
,
''
Julien
said
to
himself
.
As
one
o'clock
struck
there
*NL*
was
still
a
light
in
comte
Norbert
's
windows
.
Julien
had
never
been
*NL*
so
frightened
in
his
life
,
he
only
saw
the
dangers
of
the
enterprise
*NL*
and
had
no
enthusiasm
at
all
.
He
went
and
took
the
immense
ladder
,
*NL*
waited
five
minutes
to
give
her
time
to
tell
him
not
to
go
,
and
five
*NL*
minutes
after
one
placed
the
ladder
against
Mathilde
's
window
.
He
*NL*
mounted
softly
,
pistol
in
hand
,
astonished
at
not
being
attacked
.
As
he
*NL*
approached
the
window
it
opened
noiselessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
there
you
are
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Mathilde
to
him
with
considerable
*NL*
emotion
.
``
I
have
been
following
your
movements
for
the
last
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
very
much
embarrassed
.
He
did
not
know
how
to
conduct
*NL*
himself
.
He
did
not
feel
at
all
in
love
.
He
thought
in
his
*NL*
embarrassment
that
he
ought
to
be
venturesome
.
He
tried
to
kiss
*NL*
Mathilde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
shame
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
pushing
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Extremely
glad
at
being
rebuffed
,
he
hastened
to
look
round
him
.
The
*NL*
moon
was
so
brilliant
that
the
shadows
which
it
made
in
mademoiselle
de
*NL*
la
Mole
's
room
were
black
.
``
It
's
quite
possible
for
men
to
be
concealed
*NL*
without
my
seeing
them
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
got
in
your
pocket
at
the
side
of
your
coat
?
''
Mathilde
*NL*
said
to
him
,
delighted
at
finding
something
to
talk
about
.
She
was
*NL*
suffering
strangely
;
all
those
sentiments
of
reserve
and
timidity
which
*NL*
were
so
natural
to
a
girl
of
good
birth
,
had
reasserted
their
dominion
*NL*
and
were
torturing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
all
kinds
of
arms
and
pistols
,
''
answered
Julien
equally
glad
at
*NL*
having
something
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
take
the
ladder
away
,
''
said
Mathilde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
big
,
and
may
break
the
windows
of
the
salon
down
below
or
*NL*
the
room
on
the
ground
floor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
break
the
windows
,
''
replied
Mathilde
making
a
vain
effort
*NL*
to
assume
an
ordinary
conversational
tone
;
``
it
seems
to
me
you
can
*NL*
lower
the
ladder
by
tying
a
cord
to
the
first
rung
.
I
have
always
a
*NL*
supply
of
cords
at
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
this
is
a
woman
in
love
,
''
thought
Julien
.
``
She
actually
dares
to
*NL*
say
that
she
is
in
love
.
So
much
self-possession
and
such
shrewdness
in
*NL*
taking
precautions
are
sufficient
indications
that
I
am
not
triumphing
*NL*
over
M.
de
Croisenois
as
I
foolishly
believed
,
but
that
I
am
simply
*NL*
succeeding
him
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
what
does
it
matter
to
me
?
Do
I
*NL*
love
her
?
I
am
triumphing
over
the
marquis
in
so
far
as
he
would
be
*NL*
very
angry
at
having
a
successor
,
and
angrier
still
at
that
successor
*NL*
being
myself
.
How
haughtily
he
looked
at
me
this
evening
in
the
Cafe
*NL*
Tortoni
when
he
pretended
not
to
recognise
me
!
And
how
maliciously
he
*NL*
bowed
to
me
afterwards
,
when
he
could
not
get
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
tied
the
cord
to
the
last
rung
of
the
ladder
.
He
lowered
it
*NL*
softly
and
leant
far
out
of
the
balcony
in
order
to
avoid
its
touching
*NL*
the
window
pane
.
``
A
fine
opportunity
to
kill
me
,
''
he
thought
,
``
if
*NL*
anyone
is
hidden
in
Mathilde
's
room
;
''
but
a
profound
silence
continued
*NL*
to
reign
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladder
touched
the
ground
.
Julien
succeeded
in
laying
it
on
the
*NL*
border
of
the
exotic
flowers
along
side
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
my
mother
say
,
''
said
Mathilde
,
``
when
she
sees
her
beautiful
*NL*
plants
all
crushed
?
You
must
throw
down
the
cord
,
''
she
added
with
great
*NL*
self-possession
.
``
If
it
were
noticed
going
up
to
the
balcony
,
it
would
*NL*
be
a
difficult
circumstance
to
explain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
am
I
to
get
away
?
''
said
Julien
in
a
jesting
tone
affecting
the
*NL*
Creole
accent
.
-LRB-
One
of
the
chambermaids
of
the
household
had
been
born
*NL*
in
Saint-Domingo
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
Why
you
will
leave
by
the
door
,
''
said
Mathilde
,
delighted
at
the
*NL*
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
how
worthy
this
man
is
of
all
my
love
,
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
just
let
the
cord
fall
into
the
garden
;
Mathilde
grasped
*NL*
his
arm
.
He
thought
he
had
been
seized
by
an
enemy
and
turned
round
*NL*
sharply
,
drawing
a
dagger
.
She
had
thought
that
she
had
heard
a
window
*NL*
opening
.
They
remained
motionless
and
scarcely
breathed
.
The
moonlight
*NL*
lit
up
everything
.
The
noise
was
not
renewed
and
there
was
no
more
*NL*
cause
for
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
their
embarrassment
began
again
;
it
was
great
on
both
sides
.
*NL*
Julien
assured
himself
that
the
door
was
completely
locked
;
he
thought
*NL*
of
looking
under
the
bed
,
but
he
did
not
dare
;
``
they
might
have
*NL*
stationed
one
or
two
lackeys
there
.
''
Finally
he
feared
that
he
might
*NL*
reproach
himself
in
the
future
for
this
lack
of
prudence
,
and
did
*NL*
look
.
Mathilde
had
fallen
into
all
the
anguish
of
the
most
extreme
*NL*
timidity
.
She
was
horrified
at
her
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
with
my
letters
?
''
she
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
good
opportunity
to
upset
these
gentlemen
,
if
they
are
*NL*
eavesdropping
,
and
thus
avoiding
the
battle
,
''
thought
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
is
hid
in
a
big
Protestant
Bible
,
which
last
night
's
*NL*
diligence
is
taking
far
away
from
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
very
distinctly
as
he
went
into
these
details
,
so
as
to
be
*NL*
heard
by
any
persons
who
might
be
concealed
in
two
large
mahogany
*NL*
cupboards
which
he
had
not
dared
to
inspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
other
two
are
in
the
post
and
are
bound
for
the
same
destination
*NL*
as
the
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heavens
,
why
all
these
precautions
?
''
said
Mathilde
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
good
of
my
lying
?
''
thought
Julien
,
and
he
confessed
all
*NL*
his
suspicions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
the
cause
for
the
coldness
of
your
letters
,
dear
,
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Mathilde
in
a
tone
of
madness
rather
than
of
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
did
not
notice
that
nuance
.
The
endearment
made
him
lose
his
*NL*
head
,
or
at
any
rate
his
suspicions
vanished
.
He
dared
to
clasp
in
his
*NL*
arms
that
beautiful
girl
who
inspired
him
with
such
respect
.
He
was
*NL*
only
partially
rebuffed
.
He
fell
back
on
his
memory
as
he
had
once
at
*NL*
Besancon
with
Armanda
Binet
,
and
recited
by
heart
several
of
the
finest
*NL*
phrases
out
of
the
_
Nouvelle
Heloise
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
the
heart
of
a
man
,
''
was
the
answer
she
made
without
*NL*
listening
too
attentively
to
his
phrases
;
``
I
wanted
to
test
your
*NL*
courage
,
I
confess
it
.
Your
first
suspicions
and
your
resolutions
show
*NL*
you
even
more
intrepid
,
dear
,
than
I
had
believed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
had
to
make
an
effort
to
call
him
``
dear
,
''
and
was
evidently
*NL*
paying
more
attention
to
this
strange
method
of
speech
than
to
*NL*
the
substance
of
what
she
was
saying
.
Being
called
``
dear
''
without
*NL*
any
tenderness
in
the
tone
afforded
no
pleasure
to
Julien
;
he
was
*NL*
astonished
at
not
being
happy
,
and
eventually
fell
back
on
his
*NL*
reasoning
in
order
to
be
so
.
He
saw
that
he
was
respected
by
this
proud
*NL*
young
girl
who
never
gave
undeserved
praise
;
by
means
of
this
reasoning
*NL*
he
managed
to
enjoy
the
happiness
of
satisfied
vanity
.
It
was
not
,
*NL*
it
was
true
,
that
soulful
pleasure
which
he
had
sometimes
found
with
*NL*
madame
de
Renal
.
There
was
no
element
of
tenderness
in
the
feelings
*NL*
of
these
first
few
minutes
.
It
was
the
keen
happiness
of
a
gratified
*NL*
ambition
,
and
Julien
was
,
above
all
,
ambitious
.
He
talked
again
of
*NL*
the
people
whom
he
had
suspected
and
of
the
precautions
which
he
had
*NL*
devised
.
As
he
spoke
,
he
thought
of
the
best
means
of
exploiting
his
*NL*
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
was
still
very
embarrassed
and
seemed
paralysed
by
the
*NL*
steps
which
she
had
taken
.
She
appeared
delighted
to
find
a
topic
*NL*
of
conversation
.
They
talked
of
how
they
were
to
see
each
other
*NL*
again
.
Julien
extracted
a
delicious
joy
from
the
consciousness
of
*NL*
the
intelligence
and
the
courage
,
of
which
he
again
proved
himself
*NL*
possessed
during
this
discussion
.
They
had
to
reckon
with
extremely
*NL*
sharp
people
,
the
little
Tanbeau
was
certainly
a
spy
,
but
Mathilde
and
*NL*
himself
as
well
had
their
share
of
cleverness
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
easier
than
to
meet
in
the
library
,
and
there
make
all
*NL*
arrangements
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
appear
in
all
parts
of
the
hotel
,
''
added
Julien
,
``
without
*NL*
rousing
suspicion
almost
,
in
fact
,
in
madame
de
la
Mole
's
own
room
.
''
*NL*
It
was
absolutely
necessary
to
go
through
it
in
order
to
reach
her
*NL*
daughter
's
room
.
If
Mathilde
thought
it
preferable
for
him
always
to
*NL*
come
by
a
ladder
,
then
he
would
expose
himself
to
that
paltry
danger
*NL*
with
a
heart
intoxicated
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
listened
to
him
speaking
,
Mathilde
was
shocked
by
this
air
of
*NL*
triumph
.
``
So
he
is
my
master
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
she
was
already
a
*NL*
prey
to
remorse
.
Her
reason
was
horrified
at
the
signal
folly
which
she
*NL*
had
just
committed
.
If
she
had
had
the
power
she
would
have
annihilated
*NL*
both
herself
and
Julien
.
When
for
a
few
moments
she
managed
by
sheer
*NL*
will-power
to
silence
her
pangs
of
remorse
,
she
was
rendered
very
*NL*
unhappy
by
her
timidity
and
wounded
shame
.
She
had
quite
failed
to
*NL*
foresee
the
awful
plight
in
which
she
now
found
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
speak
to
him
,
however
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
``
That
is
the
proper
*NL*
thing
to
do
.
One
does
talk
to
one
's
lover
.
''
And
then
with
a
view
of
*NL*
accomplishing
a
duty
,
and
with
a
tenderness
which
was
manifested
rather
*NL*
in
the
words
which
she
employed
than
in
the
inflection
of
her
voice
,
*NL*
she
recounted
various
resolutions
which
she
had
made
concerning
him
*NL*
during
the
last
few
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
decided
that
if
he
should
dare
to
come
to
her
room
by
the
help
*NL*
of
the
gardener
's
ladder
according
to
his
instructions
,
she
would
be
*NL*
entirely
his
.
But
never
were
such
tender
passages
spoken
in
a
more
*NL*
polite
and
frigid
tone
.
Up
to
the
present
this
assignation
had
been
*NL*
icy
.
It
was
enough
to
make
one
hate
the
name
of
love
.
What
a
lesson
*NL*
in
morality
for
a
young
and
imprudent
girl
!
Is
it
worth
while
to
ruin
*NL*
one
's
future
for
moments
such
as
this
?
*NL*
*NL*
After
long
fits
of
hesitation
which
a
superficial
observer
might
have
*NL*
mistaken
for
the
result
of
the
most
emphatic
hate
-LRB-
so
great
is
the
*NL*
difficulty
which
a
woman
's
self-respect
finds
in
yielding
even
to
so
*NL*
firm
a
will
as
hers
-RRB-
Mathilde
became
eventually
a
charming
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
point
of
fact
,
these
ecstasies
were
a
little
artificial
.
Passionate
*NL*
love
was
still
more
the
model
which
they
imitated
than
a
real
actuality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
thought
she
was
fulfilling
a
duty
towards
*NL*
herself
and
towards
her
lover
.
``
The
poor
boy
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
*NL*
``
has
shewn
a
consummate
bravery
.
He
deserves
to
be
happy
or
it
is
*NL*
really
I
who
will
be
shewing
a
lack
of
character
.
''
But
she
would
have
*NL*
been
glad
to
have
redeemed
the
cruel
necessity
in
which
she
found
*NL*
herself
even
at
the
price
of
an
eternity
of
unhappiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
awful
violence
she
was
doing
to
herself
she
was
*NL*
completely
mistress
of
her
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
regret
and
no
reproach
spoiled
that
night
which
Julien
found
*NL*
extraordinary
rather
than
happy
.
Great
heavens
!
what
a
difference
to
*NL*
his
last
twenty-four
hours
'
stay
in
Verrieres
.
These
fine
Paris
manners
*NL*
manage
to
spoil
everything
,
even
love
,
he
said
to
himself
,
quite
*NL*
unjustly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
abandoned
himself
to
these
reflections
as
he
stood
upright
in
one
of
*NL*
the
great
mahogany
cupboards
into
which
he
had
been
put
at
the
sign
of
*NL*
the
first
sounds
of
movement
in
the
neighbouring
apartment
,
which
was
*NL*
madame
de
la
Mole
's
.
Mathilde
followed
her
mother
to
mass
,
the
servants
*NL*
soon
left
the
apartment
and
Julien
easily
escaped
before
they
came
back
*NL*
to
finish
their
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
mounted
a
horse
and
tried
to
find
the
most
solitary
spots
in
one
*NL*
of
the
forests
near
Paris
.
He
was
more
astonished
than
happy
.
The
*NL*
happiness
which
filled
his
soul
from
time
to
time
resembled
that
of
a
*NL*
young
sub-lieutenant
who
as
the
result
of
some
surprising
feat
has
just
*NL*
been
made
a
full-fledged
colonel
by
the
commander-in-chief
;
he
felt
*NL*
himself
lifted
up
to
an
immense
height
.
Everything
which
was
above
him
*NL*
the
day
before
was
now
on
a
level
with
him
or
even
below
him
.
Little
*NL*
by
little
Julien
's
happiness
increased
in
proportion
as
he
got
further
*NL*
away
from
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
there
was
no
tenderness
in
his
soul
,
the
reason
was
that
,
however
*NL*
strange
it
may
appear
to
say
so
,
Mathilde
had
in
everything
she
had
*NL*
done
,
simply
accomplished
a
duty
.
The
only
thing
she
had
not
foreseen
*NL*
in
all
the
events
of
that
night
,
was
the
shame
and
unhappiness
which
*NL*
she
had
experienced
instead
of
that
absolute
felicity
which
is
found
in
*NL*
novels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
have
made
a
mistake
,
and
not
be
in
love
with
him
?
''
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
.

CHAPTER
XLVII

*NL*
AN
OLD
SWORD
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
mean
to
be
serious
;
it
is
time
*NL*
Since
laughter
now-a-days
is
deemed
too
serious
.
*NL*
A
jest
at
vice
by
virtues
called
a
crime
.

She
did
not
appear
at
dinner
.
She
came
for
a
minute
into
the
salon
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
but
did
not
look
at
Julien
.
He
considered
this
behaviour
*NL*
strange
,
``
but
,
''
he
thought
,
``
I
do
not
know
their
usages
.
She
will
give
*NL*
me
some
good
reason
for
all
this
.
''
None
the
less
he
was
a
prey
to
*NL*
the
most
extreme
curiosity
;
he
studied
the
expression
of
Mathilde
's
*NL*
features
;
he
was
bound
to
own
to
himself
that
she
looked
cold
and
*NL*
malicious
.
It
was
evidently
not
the
same
woman
who
on
the
proceeding
*NL*
night
had
had
,
or
pretended
to
have
,
transports
of
happiness
which
were
*NL*
too
extravagant
to
be
genuine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
,
and
the
subsequent
day
she
showed
the
same
coldness
;
*NL*
she
did
not
look
at
him
,
she
did
not
notice
his
existence
.
Julien
was
*NL*
devoured
by
the
keenest
anxiety
and
was
a
thousand
leagues
removed
from
*NL*
that
feeling
of
triumph
which
had
been
his
only
emotion
on
the
first
*NL*
day
.
``
Can
it
be
by
chance
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
a
return
to
virtue
?
''
*NL*
But
this
was
a
very
bourgeois
word
to
apply
to
the
haughty
Mathilde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Placed
in
an
ordinary
position
in
life
she
would
disbelieve
in
*NL*
religion
,
''
thought
Julien
,
``
she
only
likes
it
in
so
far
as
it
is
very
*NL*
useful
to
the
interests
of
her
class
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
perhaps
she
may
as
a
mere
matter
of
delicacy
be
keenly
reproaching
*NL*
herself
for
the
mistake
which
she
has
committed
.
Julien
believed
that
*NL*
he
was
her
first
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
he
said
to
himself
at
other
moments
,
``
I
must
admit
that
there
is
*NL*
no
trace
of
naivety
,
simplicity
,
or
tenderness
in
her
own
demeanour
;
*NL*
I
have
never
seen
her
more
haughty
,
can
she
despise
me
?
It
would
be
*NL*
worthy
of
her
to
reproach
herself
simply
because
of
my
low
birth
,
for
*NL*
what
she
has
done
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Julien
,
full
of
those
preconceived
ideas
which
he
had
found
in
*NL*
books
and
in
his
memories
of
Verrieres
,
was
chasing
the
phantom
of
a
*NL*
tender
mistress
,
who
from
the
minute
when
she
has
made
her
lover
happy
*NL*
no
longer
thinks
of
her
own
existence
,
Mathilde
's
vanity
was
infuriated
*NL*
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
last
two
months
she
had
no
longer
been
bored
,
she
was
not
*NL*
frightened
of
boredom
;
consequently
,
without
being
able
to
have
the
*NL*
slightest
suspicion
of
it
,
Julien
had
lost
his
greatest
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
given
myself
a
master
,
''
said
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
to
*NL*
herself
,
a
prey
to
the
blackest
sorrow
.
``
Luckily
he
is
honour
itself
,
*NL*
but
if
I
offend
his
vanity
,
he
will
revenge
himself
by
making
known
*NL*
the
nature
of
our
relations
.
''
Mathilde
had
never
had
a
lover
,
and
*NL*
though
passing
through
a
stage
of
life
which
affords
some
tender
*NL*
illusions
even
to
the
coldest
souls
,
she
fell
a
prey
to
the
most
bitter
*NL*
reflections
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
an
immense
dominion
over
me
since
his
reign
is
one
of
terror
,
*NL*
and
he
is
capable
,
if
I
provoke
him
,
of
punishing
me
with
an
awful
*NL*
penalty
.
''
This
idea
alone
was
enough
to
induce
mademoiselle
de
la
*NL*
Mole
to
insult
him
.
Courage
was
the
primary
quality
in
her
character
.
*NL*
The
only
thing
which
could
give
her
any
thrill
and
cure
her
from
a
*NL*
fundamental
and
chronically
recurring
ennui
was
the
idea
that
she
was
*NL*
staking
her
entire
existence
on
a
single
throw
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
obstinately
refused
to
look
at
him
,
Julien
*NL*
on
the
third
day
in
spite
of
her
evident
objection
,
followed
her
into
*NL*
the
billiard-room
after
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
you
think
you
have
acquired
some
very
strong
rights
over
*NL*
me
?
''
she
said
to
him
with
scarcely
controlled
anger
,
``
since
you
venture
*NL*
to
speak
to
me
,
in
spite
of
my
very
clearly
manifested
wish
?
Do
you
*NL*
know
that
no
one
in
the
world
has
had
such
effrontery
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dialogue
of
these
two
lovers
was
incomparably
humourous
.
Without
*NL*
suspecting
it
,
they
were
animated
by
mutual
sentiments
of
the
most
*NL*
vivid
hate
.
As
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
had
a
meekly
patient
*NL*
character
,
while
they
were
both
disciples
of
good
form
,
they
soon
came
*NL*
to
informing
each
other
quite
clearly
that
they
would
break
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
eternal
secrecy
to
you
,
''
said
Julien
.
``
I
should
like
to
add
*NL*
that
I
would
never
address
a
single
word
to
you
,
were
it
not
that
a
*NL*
marked
change
might
perhaps
jeopardise
your
reputation
.
''
He
saluted
*NL*
respectfully
and
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
accomplished
easily
enough
what
he
believed
to
be
a
duty
;
he
was
*NL*
very
far
from
thinking
himself
much
in
love
with
mademoiselle
de
la
*NL*
Mole
.
He
had
certainly
not
loved
her
three
days
before
,
when
he
had
*NL*
been
hidden
in
the
big
mahogany
cupboard
.
But
the
moment
that
he
found
*NL*
himself
estranged
from
her
for
ever
his
mood
underwent
a
complete
and
*NL*
rapid
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
memory
tortured
him
by
going
over
the
least
details
in
that
night
,
*NL*
which
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
left
him
so
cold
.
In
the
very
night
that
*NL*
followed
this
announcement
of
a
final
rupture
,
Julien
almost
went
mad
*NL*
at
being
obliged
to
own
to
himself
that
he
loved
mademoiselle
de
la
*NL*
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
discovery
was
followed
by
awful
struggles
:
all
his
emotions
were
*NL*
overwhelmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
later
,
instead
of
being
haughty
towards
M.
de
Croisenois
,
he
*NL*
could
have
almost
burst
out
into
tears
and
embraced
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
habituation
to
unhappiness
gave
him
a
gleam
of
commonsense
,
he
*NL*
decided
to
leave
for
Languedoc
,
packed
his
trunk
and
went
to
the
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
he
would
faint
,
when
on
arriving
at
the
office
of
the
mails
,
he
*NL*
was
told
that
by
a
singular
chance
there
was
a
place
in
the
Toulouse
*NL*
mail
.
He
booked
it
and
returned
to
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
to
announce
his
*NL*
departure
to
the
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
la
Mole
had
gone
out
.
More
dead
than
alive
Julien
went
into
*NL*
the
library
to
wait
for
him
.
What
was
his
emotion
when
he
found
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
saw
him
come
,
she
assumed
a
malicious
expression
which
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
unhappiness
and
surprise
Julien
lost
his
head
and
was
weak
*NL*
enough
to
say
to
her
in
a
tone
of
the
most
heartfelt
tenderness
.
``
So
*NL*
you
love
me
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
horrified
at
having
given
myself
to
the
first
man
who
came
*NL*
along
,
''
said
Mathilde
crying
with
rage
against
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
man
who
came
along
,
''
cried
Julien
,
and
he
made
for
an
old
*NL*
mediaeval
sword
which
was
kept
in
the
library
as
a
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
grief
--
which
he
thought
was
at
its
maximum
at
the
moment
when
he
*NL*
had
spoken
to
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
--
had
been
rendered
a
hundred
*NL*
times
more
intense
by
the
tears
of
shame
which
he
saw
her
shedding
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
been
the
happiest
of
men
if
he
had
been
able
to
kill
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
on
the
point
of
drawing
the
sword
with
some
difficulty
from
*NL*
its
ancient
scabbard
,
Mathilde
,
rendered
happy
by
so
novel
a
sensation
,
*NL*
advanced
proudly
towards
him
,
her
tears
were
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
of
his
benefactor
--
the
marquis
de
la
Mole
--
presented
*NL*
itself
vividly
to
Julien
.
``
Shall
I
kill
his
daughter
?
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
how
horrible
.
''
He
made
a
movement
to
throw
down
the
sword
.
*NL*
``
She
will
certainly
,
''
he
thought
,
``
burst
out
laughing
at
the
sight
of
*NL*
such
a
melodramatic
pose
:
''
that
idea
was
responsible
for
his
regaining
*NL*
all
his
self-possession
.
He
looked
curiously
at
the
blade
of
the
old
*NL*
sword
as
though
he
had
been
looking
for
some
spot
of
rust
,
then
put
it
*NL*
back
in
the
scabbard
and
replaced
it
with
the
utmost
tranquillity
on
*NL*
the
gilt
bronze
nail
from
which
it
hung
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
manoeuvre
,
which
towards
the
end
was
very
slow
,
lasted
quite
*NL*
a
minute
;
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
.
``
So
*NL*
I
have
been
on
the
verge
of
being
killed
by
my
lover
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
transported
her
into
the
palmiest
days
of
the
age
of
Charles
*NL*
IX
.
and
of
Henri
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
motionless
before
Julien
,
who
had
just
replaced
the
sword
;
*NL*
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
whose
hatred
had
disappeared
.
It
must
be
*NL*
owned
that
she
was
very
fascinating
at
this
moment
,
certainly
no
woman
*NL*
looked
less
like
a
Parisian
doll
-LRB-
this
expression
symbolised
Julien
's
*NL*
great
objection
to
the
women
of
this
city
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
relapse
into
some
weakness
for
him
,
''
thought
Mathilde
;
``
it
*NL*
is
quite
likely
that
he
will
think
himself
my
lord
and
master
after
a
*NL*
relapse
like
that
at
the
very
moment
that
I
have
been
talking
to
him
so
*NL*
firmly
.
''
She
ran
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
heaven
,
she
is
pretty
said
Julien
as
he
watched
her
run
and
that
's
*NL*
the
creature
who
threw
herself
into
my
arms
with
so
much
passion
*NL*
scarcely
a
week
ago
...
and
to
think
that
those
moments
will
never
*NL*
come
back
?
And
that
it
's
my
fault
,
to
think
of
my
being
lacking
*NL*
in
appreciation
at
the
very
moment
when
I
was
doing
something
so
*NL*
extraordinarily
interesting
!
I
must
own
that
I
was
born
with
a
very
*NL*
dull
and
unfortunate
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
appeared
;
Julien
hastened
to
announce
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
to
?
''
said
M.
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Languedoc
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
if
you
please
,
you
are
reserved
for
higher
destinies
.
If
you
leave
*NL*
it
will
be
for
the
North
...
In
military
phraseology
I
actually
confine
*NL*
you
in
the
hotel
.
You
will
compel
me
to
be
never
more
than
two
or
three
*NL*
hours
away
.
I
may
have
need
of
you
at
any
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
bowed
and
retired
without
a
word
,
leaving
the
marquis
in
a
state
*NL*
of
great
astonishment
.
He
was
incapable
of
speaking
.
He
shut
himself
*NL*
up
in
his
room
.
He
was
there
free
to
exaggerate
to
himself
all
the
*NL*
awfulness
of
his
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
he
thought
,
``
I
can
not
even
get
away
.
God
knows
how
many
days
*NL*
the
marquis
will
keep
me
in
Paris
.
Great
God
,
what
will
become
of
me
,
*NL*
and
not
a
friend
whom
I
can
consult
?
The
abbe
Pirard
will
never
let
*NL*
me
finish
my
first
sentence
,
while
the
comte
Altamira
will
propose
*NL*
enlisting
me
in
some
conspiracy

And
yet
I
am
mad
;
I
feel
it
,
I
am
mad

Who
will
be

guide
me
,
what
will
become
of
me

And
she
confesses

to

goes
into
even

the
smallest
details
!
Her
beautiful
eyes
fixed
on

*NL*
The
delighted
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
thought
of
nothing
but
the
*NL*
happiness
of
having
been
nearly
killed
.
She
went
so
far
as
to
say
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
he
is
worthy
of
being
my
master
since
he
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
killing
me
.
How
many
handsome
young
society
men
would
have
to
be
melted
*NL*
together
before
they
were
capable
of
so
passionate
a
transport

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
admit
that
he
was
very
handsome
at
the
time
when
he
climbed
up
*NL*
on
the
chair
to
replace
the
sword
in
the
same
picturesque
position
in
*NL*
which
the
decorator
hung
it
!
After
all
it
was
not
so
foolish
of
me
to
*NL*
love
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
at
that
moment
some
honourable
means
of
reconciliation
had
presented
*NL*
itself
,
she
would
have
embraced
it
with
pleasure
.
Julien
locked
in
his
*NL*
room
was
a
prey
to
the
most
violent
despair
.
He
thought
in
his
madness
*NL*
of
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
.
If
instead
of
hiding
himself
in
an
out
*NL*
of
the
way
place
,
he
had
wandered
about
the
garden
of
the
hotel
so
as
*NL*
to
keep
within
reach
of
any
opportunity
,
he
would
perhaps
have
changed
*NL*
in
a
single
moment
his
awful
unhappiness
into
the
keenest
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
tact
for
whose
lack
we
are
now
reproaching
him
would
have
been
*NL*
incompatible
with
that
sublime
seizure
of
the
sword
,
which
at
the
*NL*
present
time
rendered
him
so
handsome
in
the
eyes
of
mademoiselle
de
*NL*
la
Mole
.
This
whim
in
Julien
's
favour
lasted
the
whole
day
;
Mathilde
*NL*
conjured
up
a
charming
image
of
the
short
moments
during
which
she
had
*NL*
loved
him
:
she
regretted
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
my
passion
for
this
poor
*NL*
boy
can
from
his
point
of
view
only
have
lasted
from
one
hour
after
*NL*
midnight
when
I
saw
him
arrive
by
his
ladder
with
all
his
pistols
in
*NL*
his
coat
pocket
,
till
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
It
was
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
after
that
as
I
listened
to
mass
at
Sainte-Valere
that
I
began
*NL*
to
think
that
he
might
very
well
try
to
terrify
me
into
obedience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
so
far
from
avoiding
Julien
,
*NL*
spoke
to
him
and
made
him
promise
to
follow
her
into
the
garden
.
He
*NL*
obeyed
.
It
was
a
new
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
suspecting
it
Mathilde
was
yielding
to
the
love
which
she
was
*NL*
now
feeling
for
him
again
.
She
found
an
extreme
pleasure
in
walking
by
*NL*
his
side
,
and
she
looked
curiously
at
those
hands
which
had
seized
the
*NL*
sword
to
kill
her
that
very
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
such
an
action
,
after
all
that
had
taken
place
,
some
of
the
*NL*
former
conversation
was
out
of
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
gradually
began
to
talk
confidentially
to
him
about
the
*NL*
state
of
her
heart
.
She
found
a
singular
pleasure
in
this
kind
of
*NL*
conversation
,
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
describe
to
him
the
fleeting
*NL*
moments
of
enthusiasm
which
she
had
experienced
for
M.
de
Croisenois
,
*NL*
for
M.
de
Caylus
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
M.
de
Caylus
as
well
!
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
and
all
the
jealousy
of
*NL*
a
discarded
lover
burst
out
in
those
words
,
Mathilde
thought
as
much
,
*NL*
but
did
not
feel
at
all
insulted
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
torturing
Julien
by
describing
her
former
sentiments
with
*NL*
the
most
picturesque
detail
and
the
accent
of
the
most
intimate
truth
.
*NL*
He
saw
that
she
was
portraying
what
she
had
in
her
mind
's
eye
.
He
had
*NL*
the
pain
of
noticing
that
as
she
spoke
she
made
new
discoveries
in
her
*NL*
own
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappiness
of
jealousy
could
not
be
carried
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
cruel
enough
to
suspect
that
a
rival
is
loved
,
but
there
is
no
*NL*
doubt
that
to
hear
the
woman
one
adores
confess
in
detail
the
love
*NL*
which
rivals
inspires
,
is
the
utmost
limit
of
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
how
great
a
punishment
was
there
now
for
those
impulses
of
pride
*NL*
which
had
induced
Julien
to
place
himself
as
superior
to
the
Caylus
*NL*
and
the
Croisenois
!
How
deeply
did
he
feel
his
own
unhappiness
as
he
*NL*
exaggerated
to
himself
their
most
petty
advantages
.
With
what
hearty
*NL*
good
faith
he
despised
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
struck
him
as
adorable
.
All
words
are
weak
to
express
his
*NL*
excessive
admiration
.
As
he
walked
beside
her
he
looked
surreptitiously
*NL*
at
her
hands
,
her
arms
,
her
queenly
bearing
.
He
was
so
completely
*NL*
overcome
by
love
and
unhappiness
as
to
be
on
the
point
of
falling
at
*NL*
her
feet
and
crying
``
pity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
that
person
who
is
so
beautiful
,
who
is
so
superior
to
*NL*
everything
and
who
loved
me
once
,
will
doubtless
soon
love
M.
de
*NL*
Caylus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
could
have
no
doubts
of
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
sincerity
,
*NL*
the
accent
of
truth
was
only
too
palpable
in
everything
she
said
.
In
*NL*
order
that
nothing
might
be
wanting
to
complete
his
unhappiness
there
*NL*
were
moments
when
,
as
a
result
of
thinking
about
the
sentiments
which
*NL*
she
had
once
experienced
for
M.
de
Caylus
,
Mathilde
came
to
talk
of
*NL*
him
,
as
though
she
loved
him
at
the
present
time
.
She
certainly
put
an
*NL*
inflection
of
love
into
her
voice
.
Julien
distinguished
it
clearly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
suffered
less
if
his
bosom
had
been
filled
inside
with
*NL*
molten
lead
.
Plunged
as
he
was
in
this
abyss
of
unhappiness
how
could
*NL*
the
poor
boy
have
guessed
that
it
was
simply
because
she
was
talking
to
*NL*
him
,
that
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
found
so
much
pleasure
in
recalling
*NL*
those
weaknesses
of
love
which
she
had
formerly
experienced
for
M.
de
*NL*
Caylus
or
M.
de
Luz
.
*NL*
*NL*
Words
fail
to
express
Julien
's
anguish
.
He
listened
to
these
detailed
*NL*
confidences
of
the
love
she
had
experienced
for
others
in
that
very
*NL*
avenue
of
pines
where
he
had
waited
so
few
days
ago
for
one
o'clock
*NL*
to
strike
that
he
might
invade
her
room
.
No
human
being
can
undergo
a
*NL*
greater
degree
of
unhappiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
kind
of
familiar
cruelty
lasted
for
eight
long
days
.
Mathilde
*NL*
sometimes
seemed
to
seek
opportunities
of
speaking
to
him
and
sometimes
*NL*
not
to
avoid
them
;
and
the
one
topic
of
conversation
to
which
they
both
*NL*
seemed
to
revert
with
a
kind
of
cruel
pleasure
,
was
the
description
of
*NL*
the
sentiments
she
had
felt
for
others
.
She
told
him
about
the
letters
*NL*
which
she
had
written
,
she
remembered
their
very
words
,
she
recited
*NL*
whole
sentences
by
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
during
these
last
days
to
be
envisaging
Julien
with
a
kind
*NL*
of
malicious
joy
.
She
found
a
keen
enjoyment
in
his
pangs
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
sees
that
Julien
had
no
experience
of
life
;
he
had
not
even
read
*NL*
any
novels
.
If
he
had
been
a
little
less
awkward
and
he
had
coolly
said
*NL*
to
the
young
girl
,
whom
he
adored
so
much
and
who
had
been
giving
him
*NL*
such
strange
confidences
:
``
admit
that
though
I
am
not
worth
as
much
as
*NL*
all
these
gentlemen
,
I
am
none
the
less
the
man
whom
you
loved
,
''
she
*NL*
would
perhaps
have
been
happy
at
being
at
thus
guessed
;
at
any
rate
*NL*
success
would
have
entirely
depended
on
the
grace
with
which
Julien
had
*NL*
expressed
the
idea
,
and
on
the
moment
which
he
had
chosen
to
do
so
.
In
*NL*
any
case
he
would
have
extricated
himself
well
and
advantageously
from
*NL*
a
situation
which
Mathilde
was
beginning
to
find
monotonous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
love
me
no
longer
,
me
,
who
adores
you
!
''
said
Julien
to
her
one
*NL*
day
,
overcome
by
love
and
unhappiness
.
This
piece
of
folly
was
perhaps
*NL*
the
greatest
which
he
could
have
committed
.
These
words
immediately
*NL*
destroyed
all
the
pleasure
which
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
found
in
*NL*
talking
to
him
about
the
state
of
her
heart
.
She
was
beginning
to
be
*NL*
surprised
that
he
did
not
,
after
what
had
happened
,
take
offence
at
*NL*
what
she
told
him
.
She
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
imagine
at
the
very
*NL*
moment
when
he
made
that
foolish
remark
that
perhaps
he
did
not
love
*NL*
her
any
more
.
``
His
pride
has
doubtless
extinguished
his
love
,
''
she
was
*NL*
saying
to
herself
.
``
He
is
not
the
man
to
sit
still
and
see
people
like
*NL*
Caylus
,
de
Luz
,
Croisenois
whom
he
admits
are
so
superior
,
preferred
to
*NL*
him
.
No
,
I
shall
never
see
him
at
my
feet
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
often
in
the
naivety
of
his
unhappiness
,
during
the
previous
*NL*
days
praised
sincerely
the
brilliant
qualities
of
these
gentlemen
;
he
*NL*
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
exaggerate
them
.
This
nuance
had
not
escaped
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
she
was
astonished
by
it
,
but
did
not
guess
*NL*
its
reason
.
Julien
's
frenzied
soul
,
in
praising
a
rival
whom
he
thought
*NL*
was
loved
,
was
sympathising
with
his
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
frank
but
stupid
words
changed
everything
in
a
single
moment
;
*NL*
confident
that
she
was
loved
,
Mathilde
despised
him
utterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
walking
with
him
when
he
made
his
ill-timed
remark
;
she
left
*NL*
him
,
and
her
parting
look
expressed
the
most
awful
contempt
.
She
*NL*
returned
to
the
salon
and
did
not
look
at
him
again
during
the
whole
*NL*
evening
.
This
contempt
monopolised
her
mind
the
following
day
.
The
*NL*
impulse
which
during
the
last
week
had
made
her
find
so
much
pleasure
*NL*
in
treating
Julien
as
her
most
intimate
friend
was
out
of
the
question
;
*NL*
the
very
sight
of
him
was
disagreeable
.
The
sensation
Mathilde
felt
*NL*
reached
the
point
of
disgust
;
nothing
can
express
the
extreme
contempt
*NL*
which
she
experienced
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
understood
nothing
of
the
history
of
Mathilde
's
heart
during
*NL*
the
last
week
,
but
he
distinguished
the
contempt
.
He
had
the
good
sense
*NL*
only
to
appear
before
her
on
the
rarest
possible
occasions
,
and
never
*NL*
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
without
a
mortal
anguish
that
he
,
as
it
were
,
deprived
*NL*
himself
of
her
presence
.
He
thought
he
felt
his
unhappiness
increasing
*NL*
still
further
.
``
The
courage
of
a
man
's
heart
can
not
be
carried
*NL*
further
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
He
passed
his
life
seated
at
a
little
*NL*
window
at
the
top
of
the
hotel
;
the
blind
was
carefully
closed
,
and
*NL*
from
here
at
any
rate
he
could
see
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
when
she
*NL*
appeared
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
were
his
emotions
when
he
saw
her
walking
after
dinner
with
M.
de
*NL*
Caylus
,
M.
de
Luz
,
or
some
other
for
whom
she
had
confessed
to
him
some
*NL*
former
amorous
weakness
!
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
no
idea
that
unhappiness
could
be
so
intense
;
he
was
on
*NL*
the
point
of
shouting
out
.
This
firm
soul
was
at
last
completely
*NL*
overwhelmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
about
anything
else
except
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
had
become
*NL*
odious
to
him
;
he
became
incapable
of
writing
the
simplest
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mad
,
''
the
marquis
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
frightened
that
his
secret
might
be
guessed
,
talked
*NL*
about
illness
and
succeeded
in
being
believed
.
Fortunately
for
him
*NL*
the
marquis
rallied
him
at
dinner
about
his
next
journey
;
Mathilde
*NL*
understood
that
it
might
be
a
very
long
one
.
It
was
now
several
days
*NL*
that
Julien
had
avoided
her
,
and
the
brilliant
young
men
who
had
all
*NL*
that
this
pale
sombre
being
she
had
once
loved
was
lacking
,
had
no
*NL*
longer
the
power
of
drawing
her
out
of
her
reverie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
ordinary
girl
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
would
have
sought
out
the
man
*NL*
she
preferred
among
those
young
people
who
are
the
cynosure
of
a
salon
;
*NL*
but
one
of
the
characteristics
of
genius
is
not
to
drive
its
thoughts
*NL*
over
the
rut
traced
by
the
vulgar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
if
I
were
the
companion
of
a
man
like
Julien
,
who
only
lacks
the
*NL*
fortune
that
I
possess
,
I
should
be
continually
exciting
attention
,
I
*NL*
should
not
pass
through
life
unnoticed
.
Far
from
incessantly
fearing
*NL*
a
revolution
like
my
cousins
who
are
so
frightened
of
the
people
that
*NL*
they
have
not
the
pluck
to
scold
a
postillion
who
drives
them
badly
,
I
*NL*
should
be
certain
of
playing
a
role
and
a
great
role
,
for
the
man
whom
*NL*
I
have
chosen
has
a
character
and
a
boundless
ambition
.
What
does
he
*NL*
lack
?
Friends
,
money
?
I
will
give
them
him
.
''
But
she
treated
Julien
in
*NL*
her
thought
as
an
inferior
being
whose
love
one
could
win
whenever
one
*NL*
wanted

*NL*
Engrossed
by
thoughts
of
her
future
and
the
singular
role
which
*NL*
she
hoped
to
play
,
Mathilde
soon
came
to
miss
the
dry
metaphysical
*NL*
conversations
which
she
had
often
had
with
Julien
.
Fatigued
by
*NL*
these
lofty
thoughts
she
would
sometimes
also
miss
those
moments
of
*NL*
happiness
which
she
had
found
by
his
side
;
these
last
memories
were
not

unattended
by
remorse

at
certain
times
even
overwhelmed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

she
said
to
herself
,
``
a

only
forget

real
merit

they
will
not
say
*NL*
that
it
is
his
pretty
moustache

his
skill

horsemanship
which
have

fascinated
me

and
his
ideas
on
the
analogy
between
the
events
which
are
going
to
*NL*
burst
upon
us
and
the
English
revolution
of
1688
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
seduced
,
''
she
answered
in
her
remorse
.
``
I
am
a
weak
*NL*
woman
,
but
at
least
I
have
not
been
led
astray
like
a
doll
by
exterior
*NL*
advantages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
a
revolution
why
should
not
Julien
Sorel
play
the
role
of
*NL*
Roland
and
I
the
role
of
Madame
Roland
?
I
prefer
that
part
to
Madame
de
*NL*
Stael
's
;
the
immorality
of
my
conduct
will
constitute
an
obstacle
in
*NL*
this
age
of
ours
.
I
will
certainly
not
let
them
reproach
me
with
an
act
*NL*
of
weakness
;
I
should
die
of
shame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
's
reveries
were
not
all
as
grave
,
one
must
admit
,
as
the
*NL*
thoughts
which
we
have
just
transcribed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
look
at
Julien
and
find
a
charming
grace
in
his
slightest
*NL*
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
doubtless
,
''
she
would
say
,
``
succeeded
in
destroying
in
him
the
*NL*
very
faintest
idea
he
had
of
any
one
else
's
rights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
air
of
unhappiness
and
deep
passion
with
which
the
poor
boy
*NL*
declared
his
love
to
me
eight
days
ago
proves
it
;
I
must
own
it
was
*NL*
very
extraordinary
of
me
to
manifest
anger
at
words
in
which
there
*NL*
shone
so
much
respect
and
so
much
of
passion
.
Am
I
not
his
real
wife
?
*NL*
Those
words
of
his
were
quite
natural
,
and
I
must
admit
,
were
really
*NL*
very
nice
.
Julien
still
continued
to
love
me
,
even
after
those
eternal
*NL*
conversations
in
which
I
had
only
spoken
to
him
-LRB-
cruelly
enough
I
*NL*
admit
-RRB-
,
about
those
weaknesses
of
love
which
the
boredom
of
the
life
*NL*
I
lead
had
inspired
me
for
those
young
society
men
of
whom
he
is
so
*NL*
jealous
.
Ah
,
if
he
only
knew
what
little
danger
I
have
to
fear
from
*NL*
them
;
how
withered
and
stereotyped
they
seem
to
me
in
comparison
with
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
indulging
in
these
reflections
Mathilde
made
a
random
pencil
*NL*
sketch
of
a
profile
on
a
page
of
her
album
.
One
of
the
profiles
she
*NL*
had
just
finished
surprised
and
delighted
her
.
It
had
a
striking
*NL*
resemblance
to
Julien
.
``
It
is
the
voice
of
heaven
.
That
's
one
of
the
*NL*
miracles
of
love
,
''
she
cried
ecstatically
;
``
Without
suspecting
it
,
I
*NL*
have
drawn
his
portrait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fled
to
her
room
,
shut
herself
up
in
it
,
and
with
much
application
*NL*
made
strenuous
endeavours
to
draw
Julien
's
portrait
,
but
she
was
unable
*NL*
to
succeed
;
the
profile
she
had
traced
at
random
still
remained
the
*NL*
most
like
him
.
Mathilde
was
delighted
with
it
.
She
saw
in
it
a
palpable
*NL*
proof
of
the
grand
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
only
left
her
album
very
late
when
the
marquise
had
her
called
to
*NL*
go
to
the
Italian
Opera
.
Her
one
idea
was
to
catch
sight
of
Julien
,
so
*NL*
that
she
might
get
her
mother
to
request
him
to
keep
them
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
appear
,
and
the
ladies
had
only
ordinary
vulgar
creatures
in
*NL*
their
box
.
During
the
first
act
of
the
opera
,
Mathilde
dreamt
of
the
*NL*
man
she
loved
with
all
the
ecstasies
of
the
most
vivid
passion
;
but
a
*NL*
love-maxim
in
the
second
act
sung
it
must
be
owned
to
a
melody
worthy
*NL*
of
Cimarosa
pierced
her
heart
.
The
heroine
of
the
opera
said
``
You
must
*NL*
punish
me
for
the
excessive
adoration
which
I
feel
for
him
.
I
love
him
*NL*
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
that
Mathilde
heard
this
sublime
song
everything
in
*NL*
the
world
ceased
to
exist
.
She
was
spoken
to
,
she
did
not
answer
;
her
*NL*
mother
reprimanded
her
,
she
could
scarcely
bring
herself
to
look
at
*NL*
her
.
Her
ecstasy
reached
a
state
of
exultation
and
passion
analogous
*NL*
to
the
most
violent
transports
which
Julien
had
felt
for
her
for
some
*NL*
days
.
The
divinely
graceful
melody
to
which
the
maxim
,
which
seemed
*NL*
to
have
such
a
striking
application
to
her
own
position
,
was
sung
,
*NL*
engrossed
all
the
minutes
when
she
was
not
actually
thinking
of
Julien
.
*NL*
Thanks
to
her
love
for
music
she
was
on
this
particular
evening
like
*NL*
madame
de
Renal
always
was
,
when
she
thought
of
Julien
.
Love
of
the
*NL*
head
has
doubtless
more
intelligence
than
true
love
,
but
it
only
has
*NL*
moments
of
enthusiasm
.
It
knows
itself
too
well
,
it
sits
in
judgment
on
*NL*
itself
incessantly
;
far
from
distracting
thought
it
is
made
by
sheer
*NL*
force
of
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
home
Mathilde
,
in
spite
of
madame
de
la
Mole
's
*NL*
remonstrances
,
pretended
to
have
a
fever
and
spent
a
part
of
the
night
*NL*
in
going
over
this
melody
on
her
piano
.
She
sang
the
words
of
the
*NL*
celebrated
air
which
had
so
fascinated
her
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Devo
punirmi
,
devo
punirmi
.
*NL*
Se
troppo
amai
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
result
of
this
night
of
madness
,
she
imagined
that
she
had
*NL*
succeeded
in
triumphing
over
her
love
.
This
page
will
be
prejudicial
*NL*
in
more
than
one
way
to
the
unfortunate
author
.
Frigid
souls
will
*NL*
accuse
him
of
indecency
.
But
the
young
ladies
who
shine
in
the
Paris
*NL*
salons
have
no
right
to
feel
insulted
at
the
supposition
that
one
of
*NL*
their
number
might
be
liable
to
those
transports
of
madness
which
have
*NL*
been
degrading
the
character
of
Mathilde
.
That
character
is
purely
*NL*
imaginary
,
and
is
even
drawn
quite
differently
from
that
social
code
*NL*
which
will
guarantee
so
distinguished
a
place
in
the
world
's
history
to
*NL*
nineteenth
century
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girls
who
have
adorned
this
winter
's
balls
are
certainly
not
*NL*
lacking
in
prudence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
think
either
that
they
can
be
accused
of
being
unduly
scornful
*NL*
of
a
brilliant
fortune
,
horses
,
fine
estates
and
all
the
guarantees
*NL*
of
a
pleasant
position
in
society
.
Far
from
finding
these
advantages
*NL*
simply
equivalent
to
boredom
,
they
usually
concentrate
on
them
their
*NL*
most
constant
desires
and
and
devote
to
them
such
passion
as
their
*NL*
hearts
possess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
again
is
it
love
which
is
the
dominant
principle
in
the
career
of
*NL*
young
men
who
,
like
Julien
,
are
gifted
with
some
talent
;
they
attach
*NL*
themselves
with
an
irresistible
grip
to
some
coterie
,
and
when
the
*NL*
coterie
succeeds
all
the
good
things
of
society
are
rained
upon
them
.
*NL*
Woe
to
the
studious
man
who
belongs
to
no
coterie
,
even
his
smallest
*NL*
and
most
doubtful
successes
will
constitute
a
grievance
,
and
lofty
*NL*
virtue
will
rob
him
and
triumph
.
Yes
,
monsieur
,
a
novel
is
a
mirror
*NL*
which
goes
out
on
a
highway
.
Sometimes
it
reflects
the
azure
of
the
*NL*
heavens
,
sometimes
the
mire
of
the
pools
of
mud
on
the
way
,
and
the
*NL*
man
who
carries
this
mirror
in
his
knapsack
is
forsooth
to
be
accused
*NL*
by
you
of
being
immoral
!
His
mirror
shows
the
mire
,
and
you
accuse
the
*NL*
mirror
!
Rather
accuse
the
main
road
where
the
mud
is
,
or
rather
the
*NL*
inspector
of
roads
who
allows
the
water
to
accumulate
and
the
mud
to
*NL*
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
it
is
quite
understood
that
Mathilde
's
character
is
impossible
*NL*
in
our
own
age
,
which
is
as
discreet
as
it
is
virtuous
,
I
am
less
*NL*
frightened
of
offence
by
continuing
the
history
of
the
follies
of
this
*NL*
charming
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
of
the
following
day
she
looked
out
for
opportunities
*NL*
of
convincing
herself
of
her
triumph
over
her
mad
passion
.
Her
great
*NL*
aim
was
to
displease
Julien
in
everything
;
but
not
one
of
his
movements
*NL*
escaped
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
too
unhappy
,
and
above
all
too
agitated
to
appreciate
so
*NL*
complicated
a
stratagem
of
passion
.
Still
less
was
he
capable
of
*NL*
seeing
how
favourable
it
really
was
to
him
.
He
was
duped
by
it
.
His
*NL*
unhappiness
had
perhaps
never
been
so
extreme
.
His
actions
were
so
*NL*
little
controlled
by
his
intellect
that
if
some
mournful
philosopher
*NL*
had
said
to
him
,
``
Think
how
to
exploit
as
quickly
as
you
can
those
*NL*
symptoms
which
promise
to
be
favourable
to
you
.
In
this
kind
of
*NL*
head-love
which
is
seen
at
Paris
,
the
same
mood
can
not
last
more
than
*NL*
two
days
,
''
he
would
not
have
understood
him
.
But
however
ecstatic
he
*NL*
might
feel
,
Julien
was
a
man
of
honour
.
Discretion
was
his
first
duty
.
*NL*
He
appreciated
it
.
Asking
advice
,
describing
his
agony
to
the
first
*NL*
man
who
came
along
would
have
constituted
a
happiness
analogous
to
*NL*
that
of
the
unhappy
man
who
,
when
traversing
a
burning
desert
receives
*NL*
from
heaven
a
drop
of
icy
water
.
He
realised
the
danger
,
was
frightened
*NL*
of
answering
an
indiscreet
question
by
a
torrent
of
tears
,
and
shut
*NL*
himself
up
in
his
own
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
Mathilde
walking
in
the
garden
for
a
long
time
.
When
she
at
last
*NL*
left
it
,
he
went
down
there
and
approached
the
rose
bush
from
which
she
*NL*
had
taken
a
flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
dark
and
he
could
abandon
himself
to
his
unhappiness
*NL*
without
fear
of
being
seen
.
It
was
obvious
to
him
that
mademoiselle
de
*NL*
la
Mole
loved
one
of
those
young
officers
with
whom
she
had
chatted
so
*NL*
gaily
.
She
had
loved
him
,
but
she
had
realised
his
little
merit
,
``
and
*NL*
as
a
matter
of
fact
I
had
very
little
,
''
Julien
said
to
himself
with
*NL*
full
conviction
.
``
Taking
me
all
round
I
am
a
very
dull
,
vulgar
person
,
*NL*
very
boring
to
others
and
quite
unbearable
to
myself
.
''
He
was
mortally
*NL*
disgusted
with
all
his
good
qualities
,
and
with
all
the
things
which
he
*NL*
had
once
loved
so
enthusiastically
;
and
it
was
when
his
imagination
was
*NL*
in
this
distorted
condition
that
he
undertook
to
judge
life
by
means
of
*NL*
its
aid
.
This
mistake
is
typical
of
a
superior
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
suicide
presented
itself
to
him
several
times
;
the
idea
was
*NL*
full
of
charm
,
and
like
a
delicious
rest
;
because
it
was
the
glass
of
*NL*
iced
water
offered
to
the
wretch
dying
of
thirst
and
heat
in
the
desert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
death
will
increase
the
contempt
she
has
for
me
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
``
What
a
memory
I
should
leave
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Courage
is
the
only
resource
of
a
human
being
who
has
fallen
into
this
*NL*
last
abyss
of
unhappiness
.
Julien
did
not
have
sufficient
genius
to
say
*NL*
to
himself
,
``
I
must
dare
,
''
but
as
he
looked
at
the
window
of
Mathilde
's
*NL*
room
he
saw
through
the
blinds
that
she
was
putting
out
her
light
.
He
*NL*
conjured
up
that
charming
room
which
he
had
seen
,
alas
!
once
in
his
*NL*
whole
life
.
His
imagination
did
not
go
any
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
o'clock
struck
.
Hearing
the
stroke
of
the
clock
and
saying
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
I
will
climb
up
the
ladder
,
''
scarcely
took
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
flash
of
genius
,
good
reasons
crowded
on
his
mind
.
``
May
I
be
*NL*
more
fortunate
than
before
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
He
ran
to
the
ladder
.
*NL*
The
gardener
had
chained
it
up
.
With
the
help
of
the
cock
of
one
of
*NL*
his
little
pistols
which
he
broke
,
Julien
,
who
for
the
time
being
was
*NL*
animated
by
a
superhuman
force
,
twisted
one
of
the
links
of
the
chain
*NL*
which
held
the
ladder
.
He
was
master
of
it
in
a
few
minutes
,
and
placed
*NL*
it
against
Mathilde
's
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
be
angry
and
riddle
me
with
scornful
words
!
What
does
it
*NL*
matter
?
I
will
give
her
a
kiss
,
one
last
kiss
.
I
will
go
up
to
my
room
*NL*
and
kill
myself
...
my
lips
will
touch
her
cheek
before
I
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
flew
up
the
ladder
and
knocked
at
the
blind
;
Mathilde
heard
him
*NL*
after
some
minutes
and
tried
to
open
the
blind
but
the
ladder
was
in
*NL*
the
way
.
Julien
hung
to
the
iron
hook
intending
to
keep
the
blind
open
,
*NL*
and
at
the
imminent
risk
of
falling
down
,
gave
the
ladder
a
violent
*NL*
shake
which
moved
it
a
little
.
Mathilde
was
able
to
open
the
blind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
himself
into
the
window
more
dead
than
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
you
,
dear
,
''
she
said
as
she
rushed
into
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
The
excess
of
Julien
's
happiness
was
indescribable
.
Mathilde
's
almost
*NL*
equalled
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
talked
against
herself
to
him
and
denounced
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Punish
me
for
my
awful
pride
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
clasping
him
in
her
*NL*
arms
so
tightly
as
almost
to
choke
him
.
``
You
are
my
master
,
dear
,
I
*NL*
am
your
slave
.
I
must
ask
your
pardon
on
my
knees
for
having
tried
to
*NL*
rebel
.
''
She
left
his
arms
to
fall
at
his
feet
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
*NL*
still
intoxicated
with
happiness
and
with
love
,
``
you
are
my
master
,
*NL*
reign
over
me
for
ever
.
When
your
slave
tries
to
revolt
,
punish
her
*NL*
severely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
moment
she
tore
herself
from
his
arms
,
and
lit
a
candle
,
*NL*
and
it
was
only
by
a
supreme
effort
that
Julien
could
prevent
her
from
*NL*
cutting
off
a
whole
tress
of
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
remind
myself
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
``
that
I
am
your
handmaid
.
*NL*
If
I
am
ever
led
astray
again
by
my
abominable
pride
,
show
me
this
hair
*NL*
and
say
,
`
It
is
not
a
question
of
the
emotion
which
your
soul
may
be
*NL*
feeling
at
present
,
you
have
sworn
to
obey
,
obey
on
your
honour
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
wiser
to
suppress
the
description
of
so
intense
a
transport
*NL*
of
delirious
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
unselfishness
was
equal
to
his
happiness
.
``
I
must
go
down
by
*NL*
the
ladder
,
''
he
said
to
Mathilde
,
when
he
saw
the
dawn
of
day
appear
*NL*
from
the
quarter
of
the
east
over
the
distant
chimneys
beyond
the
*NL*
garden
.
``
The
sacrifice
that
I
impose
on
myself
is
worthy
of
you
.
I
*NL*
deprive
myself
of
some
hours
of
the
most
astonishing
happiness
that
a
*NL*
human
soul
can
savour
,
but
it
is
a
sacrifice
I
make
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
your
reputation
.
If
you
know
my
heart
you
will
appreciate
how
violent
*NL*
is
the
strain
to
which
I
am
putting
myself
.
Will
you
always
be
to
me
*NL*
what
you
are
now
?
But
honour
speaks
,
it
suffices
.
Let
me
tell
you
that
*NL*
since
our
last
interview
,
thieves
have
not
been
the
only
object
of
*NL*
suspicion
.
M.
de
la
Mole
has
set
a
guard
in
the
garden
.
M.
Croisenois
*NL*
is
surrounded
by
spies
:
they
know
what
he
does
every
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
burst
out
laughing
at
this
idea
.
Her
mother
and
a
chamber-maid
*NL*
were
woken
up
,
they
suddenly
began
to
speak
to
her
through
the
door
.
*NL*
Julien
looked
at
her
,
she
grew
pale
as
she
scolded
the
chamber-maid
,
*NL*
and
she
did
not
deign
to
speak
to
her
mother
.
``
But
suppose
they
think
*NL*
of
opening
the
window
,
they
will
see
the
ladder
,
''
Julien
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
clasped
her
again
in
his
arms
,
rushed
on
to
the
ladder
,
and
slid
,
*NL*
rather
than
climbed
down
;
he
was
on
the
ground
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
seconds
after
the
ladder
was
in
the
avenue
of
pines
,
and
*NL*
Mathilde
's
honour
was
saved
.
Julien
returned
to
his
room
and
found
that
*NL*
he
was
bleeding
and
almost
naked
.
He
had
wounded
himself
in
sliding
*NL*
down
in
that
dare-devil
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Extreme
happiness
had
made
him
regain
all
the
energy
of
his
character
.
*NL*
If
twenty
men
had
presented
themselves
it
would
have
proved
at
this
*NL*
moment
only
an
additional
pleasure
to
have
attacked
them
unaided
.
*NL*
Happily
his
military
prowess
was
not
put
to
the
proof
.
He
laid
the
*NL*
ladder
in
its
usual
place
and
replaced
the
chain
which
held
it
.
He
did
*NL*
not
forget
to
efface
the
mark
which
the
ladder
had
left
on
the
bed
of
*NL*
exotic
flowers
under
Mathilde
's
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
moving
his
hand
over
the
soft
ground
in
the
darkness
and
*NL*
satisfying
himself
that
the
mark
had
entirely
disappeared
,
he
felt
*NL*
something
fall
down
on
his
hands
.
It
was
a
whole
tress
of
Mathilde
's
*NL*
hair
which
she
had
cut
off
and
thrown
down
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
at
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
your
servant
sends
you
,
''
she
said
to
him
in
a
fairly
loud
*NL*
voice
,
``
It
is
the
sign
of
eternal
gratitude
.
I
renounce
the
exercise
of
*NL*
my
reason
,
be
my
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
quite
overcome
and
was
on
the
point
of
going
to
fetch
the
*NL*
ladder
again
and
climbing
back
into
her
room
.
Finally
reason
prevailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Getting
back
into
the
hotel
from
the
garden
was
not
easy
.
He
succeeded
*NL*
in
forcing
the
door
of
a
cellar
.
Once
in
the
house
he
was
obliged
to
*NL*
break
through
the
door
of
his
room
as
silently
as
possible
.
In
his
*NL*
agitation
he
had
left
in
the
little
room
which
he
had
just
abandoned
so
*NL*
rapidly
,
the
key
which
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
.
``
I
only
hope
she
*NL*
thinks
of
hiding
that
fatal
trophy
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
fatigue
prevailed
over
happiness
,
and
as
the
sun
was
rising
he
*NL*
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
breakfast
bell
only
just
managed
to
wake
him
up
.
He
appeared
in
the
*NL*
dining-room
.
Shortly
afterwards
Mathilde
came
in
.
Julien
's
pride
felt
*NL*
deliciously
flattered
as
he
saw
the
love
which
shone
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
this
beautiful
creature
who
was
surrounded
by
so
much
homage
;
but
soon
*NL*
his
discretion
had
occasion
to
be
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Making
an
excuse
of
the
little
time
that
she
had
had
to
do
her
hair
,
*NL*
Mathilde
had
arranged
it
in
such
a
way
that
Julien
could
see
at
the
*NL*
first
glance
the
full
extent
of
the
sacrifice
that
she
had
made
for
his
*NL*
sake
,
by
cutting
off
her
hair
on
the
previous
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
been
possible
to
spoil
so
beautiful
a
face
by
anything
*NL*
whatsoever
,
Mathilde
would
have
succeeded
in
doing
it
.
A
whole
tress
*NL*
of
her
beautiful
blonde
hair
was
cut
off
to
within
half
an
inch
of
the
*NL*
scalp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
's
whole
manner
during
breakfast
was
in
keeping
with
this
*NL*
initial
imprudence
.
One
might
have
said
that
she
had
made
a
specific
*NL*
point
of
trying
to
inform
the
whole
world
of
her
mad
passion
for
*NL*
Julien
.
Happily
on
this
particular
day
M.
de
la
Mole
and
the
marquis
*NL*
were
very
much
concerned
about
an
approaching
bestowal
of
``
blue
*NL*
ribbons
''
which
was
going
to
take
place
,
and
in
which
M.
de
Chaulnes
was
*NL*
not
comprised
.
Towards
the
end
of
the
meal
,
Mathilde
,
who
was
talking
*NL*
to
Julien
,
happened
to
call
him
``
My
Master
.
''
He
blushed
up
to
the
*NL*
whites
of
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
was
not
left
alone
for
an
instant
that
day
,
whether
by
chance
*NL*
or
the
deliberate
policy
of
madame
de
la
Mole
.
In
the
evening
when
she
*NL*
passed
from
the
dining-room
into
the
salon
,
however
,
she
managed
to
say
*NL*
to
Julien
:
``
You
may
be
thinking
I
am
making
an
excuse
,
but
mamma
has
*NL*
just
decided
that
one
of
her
women
is
to
spend
the
night
in
my
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
day
passed
with
lightning
rapidity
.
Julien
was
at
the
zenith
of
*NL*
happiness
.
At
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
of
the
following
day
he
*NL*
installed
himself
in
the
library
.
He
hoped
the
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
*NL*
would
deign
to
appear
there
;
he
had
written
her
an
interminable
letter
.
*NL*
He
only
saw
her
several
hours
afterwards
at
breakfast
.
Her
hair
was
*NL*
done
to-day
with
the
very
greatest
care
;
a
marvellous
art
had
managed
*NL*
to
hide
the
place
where
the
hair
had
been
cut
.
She
looked
at
Julien
*NL*
once
or
twice
,
but
her
eyes
were
polite
and
calm
,
and
there
was
no
*NL*
question
of
calling
him
``
My
Master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
astonishment
prevented
him
from
breathing
--
Mathilde
was
*NL*
reproaching
herself
for
all
she
had
done
for
him
.
After
mature
*NL*
reflection
,
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
person
who
,
*NL*
though
not
absolutely
commonplace
,
was
yet
not
sufficiently
different
*NL*
from
the
common
ruck
to
deserve
all
the
strange
follies
that
she
*NL*
had
ventured
for
his
sake
.
To
sum
up
she
did
not
give
love
a
single
*NL*
thought
;
on
this
particular
day
she
was
tired
of
loving
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Julien
,
his
emotions
were
those
of
a
child
of
sixteen
.
He
was
a
*NL*
successive
prey
to
awful
doubt
,
astonishment
and
despair
during
this
*NL*
breakfast
which
he
thought
would
never
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
could
decently
get
up
from
the
table
,
he
flew
rather
than
*NL*
ran
to
the
stable
,
saddled
his
horse
himself
,
and
galloped
off
.
``
I
*NL*
must
kill
my
heart
through
sheer
force
of
physical
fatigue
,
''
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
as
he
galloped
through
the
Meudon
woods
.
``
What
have
I
done
,
*NL*
what
have
I
said
to
deserve
a
disgrace
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
do
nothing
and
say
nothing
to-day
,
''
he
thought
as
he
re-entered
*NL*
the
hotel
.
``
I
must
be
as
dead
physically
as
I
am
morally
.
''
Julien
saw
*NL*
nothing
any
more
,
it
was
only
his
corpse
which
kept
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
L
*NL*
*NL*
THE
JAPANESE
VASE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
does
not
first
realise
the
full
extremity
of
*NL*
his
unhappiness
:
he
is
more
troubled
than
moved
.
But
as
*NL*
reason
returns
he
feels
the
depth
of
his
misfortune
.
All
*NL*
the
pleasures
of
life
seem
to
have
been
destroyed
,
he
*NL*
can
only
feel
the
sharp
barbs
of
a
lacerating
despair
.
*NL*
But
what
is
the
use
of
talking
of
physical
pain
?
What
*NL*
pain
which
is
only
felt
by
the
body
can
be
compared
to
*NL*
this
pain
?

The
dinner
bell
rang
,
Julien
had
barely
time
to
dress
:
he
found
*NL*
Mathilde
in
the
salon
.
She
was
pressing
her
brother
and
M.
de
*NL*
Croisenois
to
promise
her
that
they
would
not
go
and
spend
the
evening
*NL*
at
Suresnes
with
madame
the
marechale
de
Fervaques
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
difficult
to
have
shown
herself
more
amiable
or
*NL*
fascinating
to
them
.
M.
de
Luz
,
de
Caylus
and
several
of
their
friends
*NL*
came
in
after
dinner
.
One
would
have
said
that
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
*NL*
had
commenced
again
to
cultivate
the
most
scrupulous
conventionality
*NL*
at
the
same
time
as
her
sisterly
affection
.
Although
the
weather
was
*NL*
delightful
this
evening
,
she
refused
to
go
out
into
the
garden
,
and
*NL*
insisted
on
their
all
staying
near
the
arm-chair
where
madame
de
la
*NL*
Mole
was
sitting
.
The
blue
sofa
was
the
centre
of
the
group
as
it
had
*NL*
been
in
the
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
was
out
of
temper
with
the
garden
,
or
at
any
rate
she
found
it
*NL*
absolutely
boring
:
it
was
bound
up
with
the
memory
of
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unhappiness
blunts
the
edge
of
the
intellect
.
Our
hero
had
the
bad
*NL*
taste
to
stop
by
that
little
straw
chair
which
had
formerly
witnessed
*NL*
his
most
brilliant
triumphs
.
To-day
none
spoke
to
him
,
his
presence
*NL*
seemed
to
be
unnoticed
,
and
worse
than
that
.
Those
of
mademoiselle
de
*NL*
la
Mole
's
friends
who
were
sitting
near
him
at
the
end
of
the
sofa
,
*NL*
made
a
point
of
somehow
or
other
turning
their
back
on
him
,
at
any
rate
*NL*
he
thought
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
court
disgrace
,
''
he
thought
.
He
tried
to
study
for
a
moment
*NL*
the
people
who
were
endeavouring
to
overwhelm
him
with
their
contempt
.
*NL*
M.
de
Luz
had
an
important
post
in
the
King
's
suite
,
the
result
of
*NL*
which
was
that
the
handsome
officer
began
every
conversation
with
*NL*
every
listener
who
came
along
by
telling
him
this
special
piece
of
*NL*
information
.
His
uncle
had
started
at
seven
o'clock
for
St.
Cloud
*NL*
and
reckoned
on
spending
the
night
there
.
This
detail
was
introduced
*NL*
with
all
the
appearance
of
good
nature
but
it
never
failed
to
be
*NL*
worked
in
.
As
Julien
scrutinized
M.
de
Croisenois
with
a
stern
gaze
of
*NL*
unhappiness
,
he
observed
that
this
good
amiable
young
man
attributed
*NL*
a
great
influence
to
occult
causes
.
He
even
went
so
far
as
to
become
*NL*
melancholy
and
out
of
temper
if
he
saw
an
event
of
the
slightest
*NL*
importance
ascribed
to
a
simple
and
perfectly
natural
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
an
element
of
madness
in
this
,
''
Julien
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
This
man
's
character
has
a
striking
analogy
with
that
of
the
Emperor
*NL*
Alexander
,
such
as
the
Prince
Korasoff
described
it
to
me
.
During
the
*NL*
first
year
of
his
stay
in
Paris
poor
Julien
,
fresh
from
the
seminary
*NL*
and
dazzled
by
the
graces
of
all
these
amiable
young
people
,
whom
he
*NL*
found
so
novel
,
had
felt
bound
to
admire
them
.
Their
true
character
was
*NL*
only
beginning
to
become
outlined
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
playing
an
undignified
role
here
,
''
he
suddenly
thought
.
The
*NL*
question
was
,
how
he
could
leave
the
little
straw
chair
without
undue
*NL*
awkwardness
.
He
wanted
to
invent
something
,
and
tried
to
extract
some
*NL*
novel
excuse
from
an
imagination
which
was
otherwise
engrossed
.
He
was
*NL*
compelled
to
fall
back
on
his
memory
,
which
was
,
it
must
be
owned
,
*NL*
somewhat
poor
in
resources
of
this
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
boy
was
still
very
much
out
of
his
element
,
and
could
not
have
*NL*
exhibited
a
more
complete
and
noticeable
awkwardness
when
he
got
up
to
*NL*
leave
the
salon
.
His
misery
was
only
too
palpable
in
his
whole
manner
.
*NL*
He
had
been
playing
,
for
the
last
three
quarters
of
an
hour
,
the
role
*NL*
of
an
officious
inferior
from
whom
one
does
not
take
the
trouble
to
*NL*
hide
what
one
really
thinks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
critical
observations
he
had
just
made
on
his
rivals
prevented
*NL*
him
,
however
,
from
taking
his
own
unhappiness
too
tragically
.
His
pride
*NL*
could
take
support
in
what
had
taken
place
the
previous
day
.
``
Whatever
*NL*
may
be
their
advantages
over
me
,
''
he
thought
,
as
he
went
into
the
*NL*
garden
alone
,
``
Mathilde
has
never
been
to
a
single
one
of
them
what
,
*NL*
twice
in
my
life
,
she
has
deigned
to
be
to
me
!
''
His
penetration
did
not
*NL*
go
further
.
He
absolutely
failed
to
appreciate
the
character
of
the
*NL*
extraordinary
person
whom
chance
had
just
made
the
supreme
mistress
of
*NL*
all
his
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
,
on
the
following
day
,
to
make
himself
and
his
horse
dead
*NL*
tired
with
fatigue
.
He
made
no
attempt
in
the
evening
to
go
near
the
*NL*
blue
sofa
to
which
Mathilde
remained
constant
.
He
noticed
that
comte
*NL*
Norbert
did
not
even
deign
to
look
at
him
when
he
met
him
about
the
*NL*
house
.
``
He
must
be
doing
something
very
much
against
the
grain
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
;
``
he
is
naturally
so
polite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sleep
would
have
been
a
happiness
to
Julien
.
In
spite
of
his
physical
*NL*
fatigue
,
memories
which
were
only
too
seductive
commenced
to
invade
his
*NL*
imagination
.
He
had
not
the
genius
to
see
that
,
inasmuch
as
his
long
*NL*
rides
on
horseback
over
forests
on
the
outskirts
of
Paris
only
affected
*NL*
him
,
and
had
no
affect
at
all
on
Mathilde
's
heart
or
mind
,
he
was
*NL*
consequently
leaving
his
eventual
destiny
to
the
caprice
of
chance
.
He
*NL*
thought
that
one
thing
would
give
his
pain
an
infinite
relief
:
it
would
*NL*
be
to
speak
to
Mathilde
.
Yet
what
would
he
venture
to
say
to
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
dreaming
deeply
about
this
at
seven
o'clock
one
morning
when
he
*NL*
suddenly
saw
her
enter
the
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
monsieur
,
that
you
are
anxious
to
speak
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
heavens
!
who
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
anyway
;
that
is
enough
.
If
you
are
dishonourable
,
you
can
*NL*
ruin
me
,
or
at
least
try
to
.
But
this
danger
,
which
I
do
not
believe
*NL*
to
be
real
,
will
certainly
not
prevent
me
from
being
sincere
.
I
do
*NL*
not
love
you
any
more
,
monsieur
,
I
have
been
led
astray
by
my
foolish
*NL*
imagination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Distracted
by
love
and
unhappiness
,
as
a
result
of
this
terrible
blow
,
*NL*
Julien
tried
to
justify
himself
.
Nothing
could
have
been
more
absurd
.
*NL*
Does
one
make
any
excuses
for
failure
to
please
?
But
reason
had
no
*NL*
longer
any
control
over
his
actions
.
A
blind
instinct
urged
him
to
get
*NL*
the
determination
of
his
fate
postponed
.
He
thought
that
,
so
long
as
*NL*
he
kept
on
speaking
,
all
could
not
be
over
.
Mathilde
had
not
listened
*NL*
to
his
words
;
their
sound
irritated
her
.
She
could
not
conceive
how
he
*NL*
could
have
the
audacity
to
interrupt
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
rendered
equally
unhappy
this
morning
by
remorseful
virtue
and
*NL*
remorseful
pride
.
She
felt
to
some
extent
pulverised
by
the
idea
of
*NL*
having
given
a
little
abbe
,
who
was
the
son
of
a
peasant
,
rights
over
*NL*
her
.
``
It
is
almost
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
in
those
moments
when
she
*NL*
exaggerated
her
own
misfortune
,
``
as
though
I
had
a
weakness
for
one
of
*NL*
my
footmen
to
reproach
myself
with
.
''
In
bold
,
proud
natures
there
is
*NL*
only
one
step
from
anger
against
themselves
to
wrath
against
others
.
In
*NL*
these
cases
the
very
transports
of
fury
constitute
a
vivid
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
single
minute
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
reached
the
point
of
loading
*NL*
Julien
with
the
signs
of
the
most
extreme
contempt
.
She
had
infinite
*NL*
wit
,
and
this
wit
was
always
triumphant
in
the
art
of
torturing
vanity
*NL*
and
wounding
it
cruelly
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
Julien
found
himself
subjected
to
*NL*
the
energy
of
a
superior
intellect
,
which
was
animated
against
him
*NL*
by
the
most
violent
hate
.
Far
from
having
at
present
the
slightest
*NL*
thought
of
defending
himself
,
he
came
to
despise
himself
.
Hearing
*NL*
himself
overwhelmed
with
such
marks
of
contempt
which
were
so
cleverly
*NL*
calculated
to
destroy
any
good
opinion
that
he
might
have
of
himself
,
*NL*
he
thought
that
Mathilde
was
right
,
and
that
she
did
not
say
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
her
,
she
found
it
deliciously
gratifying
to
her
pride
to
punish
*NL*
in
this
way
both
herself
and
him
for
the
adoration
that
she
had
felt
*NL*
some
days
previously
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
have
to
invent
and
improvise
the
cruel
remarks
which
she
*NL*
addressed
to
him
with
so
much
gusto
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
she
had
to
do
was
to
repeat
what
the
advocate
of
the
other
side
had
*NL*
been
saying
against
her
love
in
her
own
heart
for
the
last
eight
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
word
intensified
a
hundredfold
Julien
's
awful
unhappiness
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
run
away
,
but
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
took
hold
of
his
arm
*NL*
authoritatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
good
enough
to
remark
,
''
he
said
to
her
,
``
that
you
are
talking
very
*NL*
loud
.
You
will
be
heard
in
the
next
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
matter
?
''
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
answered
haughtily
.
``
Who
*NL*
will
dare
to
say
they
have
heard
me
?
I
want
to
cure
your
miserable
*NL*
vanity
once
and
for
all
of
any
ideas
you
may
have
indulged
in
on
my
*NL*
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Julien
was
allowed
to
leave
the
library
he
was
so
astonished
*NL*
that
he
was
less
sensitive
to
his
unhappiness
.
``
She
does
not
love
me
*NL*
any
more
,
''
he
repeated
to
himself
,
speaking
aloud
as
though
to
teach
*NL*
himself
how
he
stood
.
``
It
seems
that
she
has
loved
me
eight
or
ten
*NL*
days
,
but
I
shall
love
her
all
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
really
possible
she
was
nothing
to
me
,
nothing
to
my
heart
so
*NL*
few
days
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
's
heart
was
inundated
by
the
joy
of
satisfied
pride
.
So
she
*NL*
had
been
able
to
break
with
him
for
ever
!
So
complete
a
triumph
over
so
*NL*
strong
an
inclination
rendered
her
completely
happy
.
``
So
this
little
*NL*
gentleman
will
understand
,
once
and
for
all
,
that
he
has
not
,
and
will
*NL*
never
have
,
any
dominion
over
me
.
''
She
was
so
happy
that
in
reality
she
*NL*
ceased
to
love
at
this
particular
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
less
passionate
being
than
Julien
love
would
have
become
*NL*
impossible
after
a
scene
of
such
awful
humiliation
.
Without
deviating
*NL*
for
a
single
minute
from
the
requirements
of
her
own
self-respect
,
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
had
addressed
to
him
some
of
those
unpleasant
*NL*
remarks
which
are
so
well
thought
out
that
they
may
seem
true
,
even
*NL*
when
remembered
in
cold
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conclusion
which
Julien
drew
in
the
first
moment
of
so
surprising
a
*NL*
scene
,
was
that
Mathilde
was
infinitely
proud
.
He
firmly
believed
that
*NL*
all
was
over
between
them
for
ever
,
and
none
the
less
,
he
was
awkward
*NL*
and
nervous
towards
her
at
breakfast
on
the
following
day
.
This
was
a
*NL*
fault
from
which
up
to
now
he
had
been
exempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
in
small
things
as
in
big
it
was
his
habit
to
know
what
he
ought
*NL*
and
wanted
to
do
,
and
he
used
to
act
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
day
after
breakfast
madame
de
la
Mole
asked
him
for
a
fairly
*NL*
rare
,
seditious
pamphlet
which
her
cure
had
surreptitiously
brought
her
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
and
Julien
,
as
he
took
it
from
a
bracket
,
knocked
over
*NL*
a
blue
porcelain
vase
which
was
as
ugly
as
it
could
possibly
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
la
Mole
got
up
,
uttering
a
cry
of
distress
,
and
proceeded
to
*NL*
contemplate
at
close
quarters
the
ruins
of
her
beloved
vase
.
``
It
was
*NL*
old
Japanese
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
came
to
me
from
my
great
aunt
,
the
abbess
*NL*
of
Chelles
.
It
was
a
present
from
the
Dutch
to
the
Regent
,
the
Duke
of
*NL*
Orleans
,
who
had
given
it
to
his
daughter
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
had
followed
her
mother
's
movements
,
and
felt
delighted
at
*NL*
seeing
that
the
blue
vase
,
that
she
had
thought
horribly
ugly
,
was
*NL*
broken
.
Julien
was
taciturn
,
and
not
unduly
upset
.
He
saw
mademoiselle
*NL*
de
la
Mole
quite
near
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
vase
,
''
he
said
to
her
,
``
has
been
destroyed
for
ever
.
The
same
is
*NL*
the
case
with
the
sentiment
which
was
once
master
of
my
heart
.
I
would
*NL*
ask
you
to
accept
my
apologies
for
all
the
pieces
of
madness
which
it
*NL*
has
made
me
commit
.
''
And
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
would
really
say
,
''
said
madame
de
la
Mole
,
as
he
went
out
of
the
*NL*
room
,
``
that
this
M.
Sorel
is
quite
proud
of
what
he
has
just
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
went
right
home
to
Mathilde
's
heart
.
``
It
is
true
,
''
she
*NL*
said
to
herself
;
``
my
mother
has
guessed
right
.
That
is
the
sentiment
*NL*
which
animates
him
.
''
It
was
only
then
that
she
ceased
rejoicing
over
*NL*
yesterday
's
scene
.
``
Well
,
it
is
all
over
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
with
*NL*
an
apparent
calm
.
``
It
is
a
great
lesson
,
anyway
.
It
is
an
awful
and
*NL*
humiliating
mistake
!
It
is
enough
to
make
me
prudent
all
the
rest
of
my
*NL*
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
I
speak
the
truth
?
''
thought
Julien
.
``
Why
am
I
still
*NL*
tortured
by
the
love
which
I
once
had
for
that
mad
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Far
,
however
,
from
being
extinguished
as
he
had
hoped
it
would
be
,
his
*NL*
love
grew
more
and
more
rapidly
.
``
She
is
mad
,
it
is
true
,
''
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
.
``
Is
she
any
the
less
adorable
for
that
?
Is
it
possible
*NL*
for
anyone
to
be
prettier
?
Is
not
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
the
ideal
*NL*
quintessence
of
all
the
most
vivid
pleasures
of
the
most
elegant
*NL*
civilisation
?
''
These
memories
of
a
bygone
happiness
seized
hold
of
*NL*
Julien
's
mind
,
and
quickly
proceeded
to
destroy
all
the
work
of
his
*NL*
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
in
vain
that
reason
wrestles
with
memories
of
this
character
.
Its
*NL*
stern
struggles
only
increase
the
fascination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty-four
hours
after
the
breaking
of
the
Japanese
vase
,
Julien
was
*NL*
unquestionably
one
of
the
most
unhappy
men
in
the
world
.

THE

NOTE

*NL*
*NL*
I
have
seen
everything
I
relate
,
and
if
I
may
have
made
*NL*
a
mistake
when
I
saw
it
,
I
am
certainly
not
deceiving

_
Letter
to
the
author
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
summoned
him
;
M.
de
la
Mole
looked
rejuvenated
,
his
eye
was
*NL*
brilliant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
discuss
your
memory
a
little
,
''
he
said
to
Julien
,
``
it
is
said
*NL*
to
be
prodigious
.
Could
you
learn
four
pages
by
heart
and
go
and
say
*NL*
them
at
London
,
but
without
altering
a
single
word
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
was
irritably
fingering
,
the
day
's
_
Quotidienne
_
,
and
was
*NL*
trying
in
vain
to
hide
an
extreme
seriousness
which
Julien
had
never
*NL*
noticed
in
him
before
,
even
when
discussing
the
Frilair
lawsuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
already
learned
sufficient
manners
to
appreciate
that
he
*NL*
ought
to
appear
completely
taken
in
by
the
lightness
of
tone
which
was
*NL*
being
manifested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
number
of
the
_
Quotidienne
_
is
not
very
amusing
possibly
,
but
if
*NL*
M.
the
marquis
will
allow
me
,
I
shall
do
myself
the
honour
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
of
reciting
it
to
him
from
beginning
to
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
even
the
advertisements
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
accurately
and
without
leaving
out
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
give
me
your
word
?
''
replied
the
marquis
with
sudden
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
;
the
only
thing
which
could
upset
my
memory
is
the
fear
*NL*
of
breaking
my
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
I
forgot
to
put
this
question
to
you
yesterday
:
I
am
*NL*
not
going
to
ask
for
your
oath
never
to
repeat
what
you
are
going
to
*NL*
hear
.
I
know
you
too
well
to
insult
you
like
that
.
I
have
answered
for
*NL*
you
.
I
am
going
to
take
you
into
a
salon
where
a
dozen
persons
will
he
*NL*
assembled
.
You
will
make
a
note
of
what
each
one
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
uneasy
.
It
will
not
be
a
confused
conversation
by
any
means
.
*NL*
Each
one
will
speak
in
his
turn
,
though
not
necessarily
in
an
orderly
*NL*
manner
,
''
added
the
marquis
falling
back
into
that
light
,
subtle
manner
*NL*
which
was
so
natural
to
him
.
``
While
we
are
talking
,
you
will
write
out
*NL*
twenty
pages
and
will
come
back
here
with
me
,
and
we
will
get
those
*NL*
twenty
pages
down
to
four
,
and
those
are
the
four
pages
you
will
recite
*NL*
to
me
to-morrow
morning
instead
of
the
four
pages
of
the
_
Quotidienne
_
.
*NL*
You
will
leave
immediately
afterwards
.
You
must
post
about
like
a
*NL*
young
man
travelling
on
pleasure
.
Your
aim
will
be
to
avoid
attracting
*NL*
attention
.
You
will
arrive
at
the
house
of
a
great
personage
.
You
will
*NL*
there
need
more
skill
.
Your
business
will
then
be
to
take
in
all
his
*NL*
entourage
,
for
among
his
secretaries
and
his
servants
are
some
people
*NL*
who
have

agents
in
order
to
intercept
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
have
an
insignificant
letter
of
introduction

At
the

*NL*
his
Excellency
looks
at
you

take
out
this
watch

mine

I
will
lend
you
for

journey

it

done

give
me
yours

The
duke
himself
will
be
good
enough
to
write
at
your
dictation
the

four
pages
you

Having
done
this

not

you

tell
him
about
the
meeting

you
are

now
going

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
prevented
from
boring
yourself
on
the
journey
between
*NL*
Paris
and
the
minister
's
residence
by
the
thought
that
there
are
people
*NL*
who
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
fire
a
shot
at
M.
the
abbe
Sorel
.
*NL*
In
that
case
that
gentleman
's
mission
will
be
finished
,
and
I
see
a
*NL*
great
delay
,
for
how
are
we
to
know
of
your
death
,
my
dear
friend
?
Even
*NL*
your
zeal
can
not
go
to
the
length
of
informing
us
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
straight
away
and
buy
a
complete
suit
,
''
went
on
the
marquis
*NL*
seriously
.
``
Dress
in
the
fashion
of
two
years
ago
.
To-night
you
must
*NL*
look
somewhat
badly
groomed
.
When
you
travel
,
on
the
other
hand
,
you
*NL*
will
be
as
usual
.
Does
this
surprise
you
?
Does
your
suspiciousness
*NL*
guess
the
secret
?
Yes
,
my
friend
,
one
of
the
venerable
personages
you
*NL*
are
going
to
hear
deliver
his
opinion
,
is
perfectly
capable
of
giving
*NL*
information
as
the
result
of
which
you
stand
a
very
good
chance
of
*NL*
being
given
at
least
opium
some
fine
evening
in
some
good
inn
where
you
*NL*
will
have
asked
for
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
better
,
''
said
Julien
,
``
to
do
an
extra
thirty
leagues
and
not
*NL*
take
the
direct
road
.
It
is
a
case
of
Rome
,
I
suppose
...
''
The
marquis
*NL*
assumed
an
expression
of
extreme
haughtiness
and
dissatisfaction
which
*NL*
Julien
had
never
seen
him
wear
since
Bray-le-Haut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
you
will
know
,
monsieur
,
when
I
think
it
proper
to
tell
*NL*
you
.
I
do
not
like
questions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
not
one
,
''
answered
Julien
eagerly
.
``
I
swear
,
monsieur
,
I
was
*NL*
thinking
quite
aloud
.
My
mind
was
trying
to
find
out
the
safest
route
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
seems
your
mind
was
a
very
long
way
off
.
Remember
that
an
*NL*
emissary
,
and
particularly
one
of
your
age
should
not
appear
to
be
a
*NL*
man
who
forces
confidences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
very
mortified
;
he
was
in
the
wrong
.
His
vanity
tried
to
*NL*
find
an
excuse
and
did
not
find
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understand
,
''
added
monsieur
de
la
Mole
,
``
that
one
always
falls
*NL*
back
on
one
's
heart
when
one
has
committed
some
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
afterwards
Julien
was
in
the
marquis
's
ante-chamber
.
He
looked
*NL*
quite
like
a
servant
with
his
old
clothes
,
a
tie
of
a
dubious
white
,
*NL*
and
a
certain
touch
of
the
usher
in
his
whole
appearance
.
The
marquis
*NL*
burst
out
laughing
as
he
saw
him
,
and
it
was
only
then
that
Julien
's
*NL*
justification
was
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
young
man
betrays
me
,
''
said
M.
de
la
Mole
to
himself
,
``
whom
is
*NL*
one
to
trust
?
And
yet
,
when
one
acts
,
one
must
trust
someone
.
My
son
*NL*
and
his
brilliant
friends
of
the
same
calibre
have
as
much
courage
and
*NL*
loyalty
as
a
hundred
thousand
men
.
If
it
were
necessary
to
fight
,
they
*NL*
would
die
on
the
steps
of
the
throne
.
They
know
everything
--
except
*NL*
what
one
needs
in
emergency
.
Devil
take
me
if
I
can
find
a
single
one
*NL*
among
them
who
can
learn
four
pages
by
heart
and
do
a
hundred
leagues
*NL*
without
being
tracked
down
.
Norbert
would
know
how
to
sell
his
life
as
*NL*
dearly
as
his
grandfathers
did
.
But
any
conscript
could
do
as
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
fell
into
a
profound
reverie
.
``
As
for
selling
one
's
life
*NL*
too
,
''
he
said
with
a
sigh
,
``
perhaps
this
Sorel
would
manage
it
quite
as
*NL*
well
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
get
into
the
carriage
,
''
said
the
marquis
as
though
to
chase
*NL*
away
an
unwanted
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
Julien
,
``
while
they
were
getting
this
suit
ready
for
*NL*
me
,
I
learnt
the
first
page
of
to-days
_
Quotidienne
_
by
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
took
the
paper
.
Julien
recited
it
without
making
a
single
*NL*
mistake
.
``
Good
,
''
said
the
marquis
,
who
this
night
felt
very
diplomatic
.
*NL*
``
During
the
time
he
takes
over
this
our
young
man
will
not
notice
the
*NL*
streets
through
which
we
are
passing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
arrived
in
a
big
salon
that
looked
melancholy
enough
and
was
*NL*
partly
upholstered
in
green
velvet
.
In
the
middle
of
the
room
*NL*
a
scowling
lackey
had
just
placed
a
big
dining-table
which
he
*NL*
subsequently
changed
into
a
writing-table
by
means
of
an
immense
green
*NL*
inkstained
tablecloth
which
had
been
plundered
from
some
minister
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
of
the
house
was
an
enormous
man
whose
name
was
not
*NL*
pronounced
.
Julien
thought
he
had
the
appearance
and
eloquence
of
a
*NL*
man
who
ruminated
.
At
a
sign
from
the
marquis
,
Julien
had
remained
at
*NL*
the
lower
end
of
the
table
.
In
order
to
keep
himself
in
countenance
,
*NL*
he
began
to
cut
quills
.
He
counted
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
seven
*NL*
visitors
,
but
Julien
could
only
see
their
backs
.
Two
seemed
to
him
*NL*
to
be
speaking
to
M.
de
la
Mole
on
a
footing
of
equality
,
the
others
*NL*
seemed
more
or
less
respectful
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
new
person
entered
without
being
announced
.
``
This
is
strange
,
''
*NL*
thought
Julien
.
``
People
are
not
announced
in
this
salon
.
Is
this
*NL*
precaution
taken
in
my
honour
?
''
Everybody
got
up
to
welcome
the
new
*NL*
arrival
.
He
wore
the
same
extremely
distinguished
decoration
as
three
*NL*
of
the
other
persons
who
were
in
the
salon
.
They
talked
fairly
low
.
In
*NL*
endeavouring
to
form
an
opinion
of
the
new
comer
,
Julien
was
reduced
to
*NL*
seeing
what
he
could
learn
from
his
features
and
his
appearance
.
He
was
*NL*
short
and
thick-set
.
He
had
a
high
colour
and
a
brilliant
eye
and
an
*NL*
expression
that
looked
like
a
malignant
boar
,
and
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
attention
was
partly
distracted
by
the
almost
immediate
*NL*
arrival
of
a
very
different
kind
of
person
.
It
was
a
tall
very
thin
*NL*
man
who
wore
three
or
four
waistcoats
.
His
eye
was
caressing
,
his
*NL*
demeanour
polite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
looks
exactly
like
the
old
bishop
of
Besancon
,
''
thought
Julien
.
*NL*
This
man
evidently
belonged
to
the
church
,
was
apparently
not
more
than
*NL*
fifty
to
fifty-five
years
of
age
,
and
no
one
could
have
looked
more
*NL*
paternal
than
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
bishop
of
Agde
appeared
.
He
looked
very
astonished
when
,
*NL*
in
making
a
scrutiny
of
those
present
,
his
gaze
fell
upon
Julien
.
He
*NL*
had
not
spoken
to
him
since
the
ceremony
of
Bray-le-Haut
.
His
look
of
*NL*
surprise
embarrassed
and
irritated
Julien
.
``
What
!
''
he
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
will
knowing
a
man
always
turn
out
unfortunate
for
me
?
I
do
n't
feel
*NL*
the
least
bit
intimidated
by
all
those
great
lords
whom
I
have
never
*NL*
seen
,
but
the
look
of
that
young
bishop
freezes
me
.
I
must
admit
that
I
*NL*
am
a
very
strange
and
very
unhappy
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
extremely
swarthy
little
man
entered
noisily
soon
afterwards
and
*NL*
started
talking
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
door
.
He
had
a
yellow
*NL*
complexion
and
looked
a
little
mad
.
As
soon
as
this
ruthless
talker
*NL*
arrived
,
the
others
formed
themselves
into
knots
with
the
apparent
*NL*
object
of
avoiding
the
bother
of
listening
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
away
from
the
mantelpiece
they
came
near
the
lower
end
*NL*
of
the
table
where
Julien
was
placed
.
His
countenance
became
more
and
*NL*
more
embarrassed
,
for
whatever
efforts
he
made
,
he
could
not
avoid
*NL*
hearing
,
and
in
spite
of
all
his
lack
of
experience
he
appreciated
*NL*
all
the
moment
of
the
things
which
they
were
discussing
with
such
*NL*
complete
frankness
,
and
the
importance
which
the
high
personages
whom
*NL*
he
apparently
had
under
his
observation
must
attach
to
their
being
kept
*NL*
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
already
cut
twenty
quills
as
slowly
as
possible
;
this
*NL*
distraction
would
shortly
be
no
longer
available
.
He
looked
in
vain
at
*NL*
M.
de
la
Mole
's
eyes
for
an
order
;
the
marquis
had
forgotten
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
am
doing
is
ridiculous
,
''
he
said
to
himself
as
he
cut
his
*NL*
quills
,
``
but
persons
with
so
mediocre
an
appearance
and
who
are
*NL*
handling
such
great
interests
either
for
themselves
or
for
others
must
*NL*
be
extremely
liable
to
take
offence
.
My
unfortunate
look
has
a
certain
*NL*
questioning
and
scarcely
respectful
expression
,
which
will
doubtless
*NL*
irritate
them
.
But
if
I
palpably
lower
my
eyes
I
shall
look
as
if
I
*NL*
were
picking
up
every
word
they
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
embarrassment
was
extreme
,
he
was
listening
to
strange
things
.

CHAPTER
LII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
DISCUSSION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
republic
:
--
For
one
man
to
day
who
will
sacrifice
*NL*
everything
for
the
public
welfare
,
there
are
thousands
*NL*
and
millions
who
think
of
nothing
except
their
*NL*
enjoyments
and
their
vanity
.
One
is
requested
in
Paris
*NL*
by
reason
of
the
qualities
not
of
one
's
self
but
of
*NL*
one
's
carriage
.
*NL*
--
NAPOLEON
,
Memorial
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
footman
rushed
in
saying
``
Monsieur
the
duke
de
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
,
you
are
just
a
fool
,
''
said
the
duke
as
he
entered
.
*NL*
He
spoke
these
words
so
well
,
and
with
so
much
majesty
,
that
Julien
*NL*
could
not
help
thinking
this
great
person
's
accomplishments
were
*NL*
limited
to
the
science
of
snubbing
a
lackey
.
Julien
raised
his
*NL*
eyes
and
immediately
lowered
them
.
He
had
so
fully
appreciated
the
*NL*
significance
of
the
new
arrival
that
he
feared
that
his
look
might
be
*NL*
an
indiscretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
was
a
man
of
fifty
dressed
like
a
dandy
and
with
a
jerky
*NL*
walk
.
He
had
a
narrow
head
with
a
large
nose
and
a
face
that
jutted
*NL*
forward
;
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
have
looked
at
the
same
time
*NL*
more
insignificant
.
His
arrival
was
the
signal
for
the
opening
of
the
*NL*
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
sharply
interrupted
in
his
physiognomical
observations
by
*NL*
de
la
Mole
's
voice
.
``
I
present
to
you
M.
the
abbe
Sorel
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Marquis
.
``
He
is
gifted
with
an
astonishing
memory
;
it
is
scarcely
an
*NL*
hour
ago
since
I
spoke
to
him
of
the
mission
by
which
he
might
be
*NL*
honoured
,
and
he
has
learned
the
first
page
of
the
_
Quotidienne
_
by
*NL*
heart
in
order
to
give
proof
of
his
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
foreign
news
of
that
poor
N
--
''
said
the
master
of
the
house
.
He
*NL*
took
up
the
paper
eagerly
and
looked
at
Julien
in
a
manner
rendered
*NL*
humorous
by
its
own
self-importance
.
``
Speak
,
monsieur
,
''
he
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
was
profound
,
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
Julien
.
He
recited
*NL*
so
well
that
the
duke
said
at
the
end
of
twenty
lines
,
``
That
is
*NL*
enough
.
''
The
little
man
who
looked
like
a
boar
sat
down
.
He
was
the
*NL*
president
,
for
he
had
scarcely
taken
his
place
before
he
showed
Julien
*NL*
a
card-table
and
signed
to
him
to
bring
it
near
him
.
Julien
established
*NL*
himself
at
it
with
writing
materials
.
He
counted
twelve
persons
seated
*NL*
round
the
green
table
cloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Sorel
,
''
said
the
Duke
,
``
retire
into
next
room
,
you
will
be
called
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
of
the
house
began
to
look
very
anxious
.
``
The
shutters
*NL*
are
not
shut
,
''
he
said
to
his
neighbour
in
a
semi-whisper
.
``
It
is
no
*NL*
good
looking
out
of
the
window
,
''
he
stupidly
cried
to
Julien
--
``
so
*NL*
here
I
am
more
or
less
mixed
up
in
a
conspiracy
,
''
thought
the
latter
.
*NL*
``
Fortunately
it
is
not
one
of
those
which
lead
to
the
Place-de-Greve
.
*NL*
Even
though
there
were
danger
,
I
owe
this
and
even
more
to
the
marquis
,
*NL*
and
should
be
glad
to
be
given
the
chance
of
making
up
for
all
the
*NL*
sorrow
which
my
madness
may
one
day
occasion
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
thinking
of
his
own
madness
and
his
own
unhappiness
he
regarded
*NL*
the
place
where
he
was
,
in
such
a
way
as
to
imprint
it
upon
his
memory
*NL*
for
ever
.
He
then
remembered
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
never
heard
*NL*
the
lackey
tell
the
name
of
the
street
,
and
that
the
marquis
had
taken
*NL*
a
fiacre
which
he
never
did
in
the
ordinary
way
.
Julien
was
left
to
*NL*
his
own
reflections
for
a
long
time
.
He
was
in
a
salon
upholstered
in
*NL*
red
velvet
with
large
pieces
of
gold
lace
.
A
large
ivory
crucifix
was
*NL*
on
the
console-table
and
a
gilt-edged
,
magnificently
bound
copy
of
M.
*NL*
de
Maistre
's
book
_
The
Pope
_
was
on
the
mantelpiece
.
Julien
opened
it
*NL*
so
as
not
to
appear
to
be
eavesdropping
.
From
time
to
time
they
talked
*NL*
loudly
in
the
next
room
.
At
last
the
door
was
opened
and
he
was
called
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
gentlemen
,
''
the
president
was
saying
``
that
from
this
moment
*NL*
we
are
talking
in
the
presence
of
the
duke
of
--
.
This
gentleman
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
pointing
to
Julien
,
``
is
a
young
acolyte
devoted
to
our
sacred
*NL*
cause
who
by
the
aid
of
his
marvellous
memory
will
repeat
quite
easily
*NL*
our
very
slightest
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
your
turn
to
speak
,
Monsieur
,
''
he
said
pointing
to
the
paternal
*NL*
looking
personage
who
wore
three
or
four
waistcoats
.
Julien
thought
it
*NL*
would
have
been
more
natural
to
have
called
him
the
gentleman
in
the
*NL*
waistcoats
.
He
took
some
paper
and
wrote
a
great
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
At
this
juncture
the
author
would
have
liked
to
have
put
a
page
of
*NL*
dots
.
``
That
,
''
said
his
publisher
,
``
would
be
clumsy
and
in
the
case
of
*NL*
so
light
a
work
clumsiness
is
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Politics
,
''
replies
the
author
,
``
is
a
stone
tied
round
the
neck
of
*NL*
literature
which
submerges
it
in
less
than
six
months
.
Politics
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
imaginative
matter
is
like
a
pistol
shot
in
the
middle
of
a
*NL*
concert
.
The
noise
is
racking
without
being
energetic
.
It
does
not
*NL*
harmonise
with
the
sound
of
any
instrument
.
These
politics
will
give
*NL*
mortal
offence
to
one
half
of
the
readers
and
will
bore
the
other
half
,
*NL*
who
will
have
already
read
the
ideas
in
question
as
set
out
in
the
*NL*
morning
paper
in
its
own
drastic
manner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
characters
do
n't
talk
politics
,
''
replied
the
publisher
,
``
they
*NL*
cease
to
be
Frenchmen
of
1830
,
and
your
book
is
no
longer
a
mirror
as
*NL*
you
claim
?
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
record
ran
to
twenty-six
pages
.
Here
is
a
very
diluted
*NL*
extract
,
for
it
has
been
necessary
to
adopt
the
invariable
practice
of
*NL*
suppressing
those
ludicrous
passages
,
whose
violence
would
have
seemed
*NL*
either
offensive
or
intolerable
-LRB-
see
the
_
Gazette
des
Tribunaux
_
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
with
the
waistcoats
and
the
paternal
expression
-LRB-
he
was
perhaps
*NL*
a
bishop
-RRB-
often
smiled
and
then
his
eyes
,
which
were
surrounded
with
*NL*
a
floating
forest
of
eyebrows
,
assumed
a
singular
brilliance
and
an
*NL*
unusually
decided
expression
.
This
personage
whom
they
made
speak
first
*NL*
before
the
duke
-LRB-
``
but
what
duke
is
it
?
''
thought
Julien
to
himself
-RRB-
with
*NL*
the
apparent
object
of
expounding
various
points
of
view
and
fulfilling
*NL*
the
functions
of
an
advocate-general
,
appeared
to
Julien
to
fall
into
*NL*
the
uncertainty
and
lack
of
definiteness
with
which
those
officials
*NL*
are
so
often
taxed
.
During
the
course
of
the
discussion
the
duke
went
*NL*
so
far
as
to
reproach
him
on
this
score
.
After
several
sentences
of
*NL*
morality
and
indulgent
philosophy
the
man
in
the
waistcoats
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Noble
England
,
under
the
guiding
hand
of
a
great
man
,
the
immortal
*NL*
Pitt
,
has
spent
forty
milliards
of
francs
in
opposing
the
revolution
.
*NL*
If
this
meeting
will
allow
me
to
treat
so
melancholy
a
subject
with
*NL*
some
frankness
,
England
fails
to
realise
sufficiently
that
in
dealing
*NL*
with
a
man
like
Buonaparte
,
especially
when
they
have
nothing
to
*NL*
oppose
him
with
,
except
a
bundle
of
good
intentions
there
is
nothing
*NL*
decisive
except
personal
methods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
praising
assassination
again
!
''
said
the
master
of
the
house
*NL*
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spare
us
your
sentimental
sermons
,
''
cried
the
president
angrily
.
His
*NL*
boarlike
eye
shone
with
a
savage
brilliance
.
``
Go
on
,
''
he
said
to
the
*NL*
man
with
the
waistcoats
.
The
cheeks
and
the
forehead
of
the
president
*NL*
became
purple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Noble
England
,
''
replied
the
advocate-general
,
``
is
crushed
to-day
:
*NL*
for
each
Englishman
before
paying
for
his
own
bread
is
obliged
to
pay
*NL*
the
interest
on
forty
milliards
of
francs
which
were
used
against
the
*NL*
Jacobins
.
She
has
no
more
Pitt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
the
Duke
of
Wellington
,
''
said
a
military
personage
looking
*NL*
very
important
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
gentlemen
,
silence
,
''
exclaimed
the
president
.
``
If
we
are
still
*NL*
going
to
dispute
,
there
was
no
point
in
having
M.
Sorel
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
know
that
monsieur
has
many
ideas
,
''
said
the
duke
irritably
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
interrupter
who
was
an
old
Napoleonic
general
.
Julien
*NL*
saw
that
these
words
contained
some
personal
and
very
offensive
*NL*
allusion
.
Everybody
smiled
,
the
turncoat
general
appeared
beside
*NL*
himself
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
longer
a
Pitt
,
gentlemen
,
''
went
on
the
speaker
with
all
*NL*
the
despondency
of
a
man
who
has
given
up
all
hope
of
bringing
his
*NL*
listeners
to
reason
.
``
If
there
were
a
new
Pitt
in
England
,
you
would
*NL*
not
dupe
a
nation
twice
over
by
the
same
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
why
a
victorious
general
,
a
Buonaparte
,
will
be
henceforward
*NL*
impossible
in
France
,
''
exclaimed
the
military
interrupter
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
occasion
neither
the
president
nor
the
duke
ventured
to
get
*NL*
angry
,
though
Julien
thought
he
read
in
their
eyes
that
they
would
*NL*
very
much
like
to
have
done
so
.
They
lowered
their
eyes
,
and
the
duke
*NL*
contented
himself
with
sighing
in
quite
an
audible
manner
.
But
the
*NL*
speaker
was
put
upon
his
mettle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
audience
is
eager
for
me
to
finish
,
''
he
said
vigorously
,
completely
*NL*
discarding
that
smiling
politeness
and
that
balanced
diction
that
*NL*
Julien
thought
had
expressed
his
character
so
well
.
``
It
is
eager
for
*NL*
me
to
finish
,
it
is
not
grateful
to
me
for
the
efforts
I
am
making
to
*NL*
offend
nobody
's
ears
,
however
long
they
may
be
.
Well
,
gentlemen
,
I
will
*NL*
be
brief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
in
quite
common
words
:
England
has
not
got
a
sou
with
*NL*
which
to
help
the
good
cause
.
If
Pitt
himself
were
to
come
back
he
*NL*
would
never
succeed
with
all
his
genius
in
duping
the
small
English
*NL*
landowners
,
for
they
know
that
the
short
Waterloo
campaign
alone
cost
*NL*
them
a
milliard
of
francs
.
As
you
like
clear
phrases
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
speaker
,
becoming
more
and
more
animated
,
``
I
will
say
this
to
you
:
Help
*NL*
yourselves
,
for
England
has
not
got
a
guinea
left
to
help
you
with
,
*NL*
and
when
England
does
not
pay
,
Austria
,
Russia
and
Prussia
--
who
will
*NL*
only
have
courage
but
have
no
money
--
can
not
launch
more
than
one
or
two
*NL*
campaigns
against
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
may
hope
that
the
young
soldiers
who
will
be
recruited
by
the
*NL*
Jacobins
will
be
beaten
in
the
first
campaign
,
and
possibly
in
the
*NL*
second
;
but
,
even
though
I
seem
a
revolutionary
in
your
prejudiced
*NL*
eyes
,
in
the
third
campaign
--
in
the
third
campaign
I
say
--
you
will
have
*NL*
the
soldiers
of
1794
who
were
no
longer
the
soldiers
enlisted
in
1792
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
interruption
broke
out
simultaneously
from
three
or
four
*NL*
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
president
to
Julien
,
``
Go
and
make
a
precis
in
the
*NL*
next
room
of
the
beginning
of
the
report
which
you
have
written
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
went
out
to
his
great
regret
.
The
speaker
was
just
dealing
*NL*
with
the
question
of
probabilities
which
formed
the
usual
subject
*NL*
for
his
meditations
.
``
They
are
frightened
of
my
making
fun
of
them
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
.
When
he
was
called
back
,
M.
de
la
Mole
was
saying
with
a
*NL*
seriousness
which
seemed
quite
humorous
to
Julien
who
knew
him
so
well
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
gentlemen
,
one
finds
the
phrase
,
`
is
it
god
,
table
or
tub
?
'
*NL*
especially
applicable
to
this
unhappy
people
.
'
_
It
is
god
_
'
exclaims
*NL*
the
writer
of
fables
.
It
is
to
you
,
gentlemen
,
that
this
noble
and
*NL*
profound
phrase
seems
to
apply
.
Act
on
your
own
initiative
,
and
noble
*NL*
France
will
appear
again
,
almost
such
as
our
ancestors
made
her
,
and
as
*NL*
our
own
eyes
have
seen
her
before
the
death
of
Louis
XVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
England
execrates
disgraceful
Jacobinism
as
much
as
we
do
,
or
at
any
*NL*
rate
her
noble
lords
do
.
Without
English
gold
,
Austria
and
Prussia
*NL*
would
only
be
able
to
give
battle
two
or
three
times
.
Would
that
be
*NL*
sufficient
to
ensure
a
successful
occupation
like
the
one
which
M.
de
*NL*
Richelieu
so
foolishly
failed
to
exploit
in
1817
?
I
do
not
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
there
was
an
interruption
which
was
stifled
by
the
hushes
*NL*
of
the
whole
room
.
It
came
again
from
the
old
Imperial
general
who
*NL*
wanted
the
blue
ribbon
and
wished
to
figure
among
the
authors
of
the
*NL*
secret
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
so
,
''
replied
M.
de
la
Mole
,
after
the
uproar
had
*NL*
subsided
.
He
laid
stress
on
the
``
I
''
with
an
insolence
which
charmed
*NL*
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
pretty
piece
of
acting
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
as
he
made
his
*NL*
pen
almost
keep
pace
with
the
marquis
'
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
la
Mole
annihilated
the
twenty
campaigns
of
the
turncoat
with
a
*NL*
well
turned
phrase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
only
on
foreign
powers
,
''
continued
the
marquis
in
a
more
*NL*
even
tone
,
``
on
whom
we
shall
be
able
to
rely
for
a
new
military
*NL*
occupation

All
those
young
men
who
write
inflammatory
articles
*NL*
in
the
_
Globe

will
provide
you
with
three
or
four
thousand
young
*NL*
captains
among
whom
you
may
find
men
with
the
genius
,
but
not
the
good
*NL*
intentions
of
a
Kleber
,
a
Hoche
,
a
Jourdan
,
a
Pichegru

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did
not
know
how
to
glorify
him
,
''
said
the
president
.
``
He
should
*NL*
have
been
immortalized
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finally
,
it
is
necessary
for
France
to
have
two
parties
,
''
went
on
M.
*NL*
de
la
Mole
;
``
but
two
parties
not
merely
in

with
clear-cut

us
realise
what
has
got
to
be
crushed

On

the
one

the
journalists
and
the
electors
,
in
a
word

public
*NL*
opinion

all
that
admire
it

While
it
is
stupefying
itself
*NL*
with
the
noise
of
its

we
have
certain
advantages

administrating
the
expenditure

the
budget

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
there
was
another
interruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
you

said
M.
de
la
Mole
to
the
interrupter
,
with
an
*NL*
admirable
haughtiness
and
ease
of
manner
,
``

not
spend

You
have
nothing

three

do
for

you
what
Gustavus
did

*NL*
*NL*
The
first
law
of
every
being
,
is
to
preserve
itself

The
great
personage
continued
.
One
could
see
that
he
knew
his
subject
.
*NL*
He
proceeded
to
expound
the
following
great
truths
with
a
soft
and
*NL*
tempered
eloquence
with
which
Julien
was
inordinately
delighted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
1
.
England
has
not
a
guinea
to
help
us
with
;
economy
and
Hume
are
*NL*
the
fashion
there
.
Even
the
saints
will
not
give
us
any
money
,
and
M.
*NL*
Brougham
will
make
fun
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
2
.
The
impossibility
of
getting
the
kings
of
Europe
to
embark
on
more
*NL*
than
two
campaigns
without
English
gold
;
two
campaigns
will
not
be
*NL*
enough
to
dispose
of
the
middle
classes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
3
.
The
necessity
of
forming
an
armed
party
in
France
.
Without
this
,
*NL*
the
monarchical
principle
in
Europe
will
not
risk
even
two
campaigns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fourth
point
which
I
venture
to
suggest
to
you
,
as
self-evident
,
*NL*
is
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
impossibility
of
forming
an
armed
party

the
*NL*
clergy

I
am
bold
enough
to
tell
you
this
because
I
will
prove
it
to
*NL*
you

You
must
make
every
sacrifice
for
the
clergy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Firstly

because
as
it
is
occupied
with
its
mission
by
day
and
by

night
,
and
guided
by
highly
capable
men
established
far
from
these
*NL*
storms
at
three
hundred
leagues
from
your
frontiers

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Rome
,
Rome
!
''
exclaimed
the
master
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
Rome
,
''
replied
the
Cardinal
haughtily
.
``
Whatever
more
*NL*
or
less
ingenious
jokes
may
have
been
the
fashion
when
you
were
young
,
*NL*
I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
in
1830
it
is
only
the
clergy
,
*NL*
under
the
guidance
of
Rome
,
who
has
the
ear
of
the
lower
classes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty
thousand
priests
repeat
the
same
words
on
the
day
appointed
by
*NL*
their
chiefs
,
and
the
people

who
after
all
provide
soldiers
--
will
be
*NL*
more
touched
by
the
voices
of
its
priests
than
by
all
the
versifying
in
*NL*
the
whole
world

-LRB-
This
personality
provoked
some
murmurs
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
clergy
has
a
genius
superior
to
yours
,
''
went
on
the
cardinal
*NL*
raising
his
voice
.
``
All
the
progress
that
has
been
made
towards
this
*NL*
essential
point
of
having
an
armed
party
in
France
has
been
made
by
*NL*
us
.
''
At
this
juncture
facts
were
introduced
.
``
Who
used
eighty
thousand
*NL*
rifles
in
Vendee
?

etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
as
the
clergy
is
without
its
forests
it
is
helpless

At
*NL*
the
first
war
the
minister
of
finance
will
write
to
his
agents
that
*NL*
there
is
no
money
to
be
had
except
for
the
cure
.
At
bottom
France
*NL*
does
not
believe
,
and
she
loves
war
.
Whoever
gives
her
war
will
be
*NL*
doubly
popular
,
for
making
war
is
,
to
use
a
vulgar
phrase
,
the
same
as
*NL*
starving
the
Jesuits
;
making
war
means
delivering
those
monsters
of
*NL*
pride
--
the
men
of
France
--
from
the
menace
of
foreign
intervention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
had
a
favourable
hearing
.
``
M.
de
Nerval
,
''
he
said
,
``
will
*NL*
have
to
leave
the
ministry
,
his
name
irritates
and
to
no
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
everybody
got
up
and
talked
at
the
same
time
.
``
I
will
be
*NL*
sent
away
again
,
''
thought
Julien
,
but
the
sapient
president
himself
had
*NL*
forgotten
both
the
presence
and
existence
of
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
were
turned
upon
a
man
whom
Julien
recognised
.
It
was
M.
de
*NL*
Nerval
,
the
prime
minister
,
whom
he
had
seen
at
M.
the
duc
de
Retz
's
*NL*
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
disorder
was
at
its
height
,
as
the
papers
say
when
they
talk
of
the
*NL*
Chamber
.
At
the
end
of
a
long
quarter
of
an
hour
a
little
quiet
was
*NL*
established
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
M.
de
Nerval
got
up
and
said
in
an
apostolic
tone
and
a
singular
*NL*
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
I
do
not
set
great
store
on
being
*NL*
a
minister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
demonstrated
to
me
,
gentlemen
,
that
my
name
will
double
*NL*
the
forces
of
the
Jacobins
by
making
many
moderates
divide
against
*NL*
us
.
I
should
therefore
be
willing
to
retire
;
but
the
ways
of
the
Lord
*NL*
are
only
visible
to
a
small
number
;
but
,
''
he
added
,
looking
fixedly
*NL*
at
the
cardinal
,
``
I
have
a
mission
.
Heaven
has
said
:
`
You
will
either
*NL*
loose
your
head
on
the
scaffold
or
you
will
re-establish
the
monarchy
*NL*
of
France
and
reduce
the
Chambers
to
the
condition
of
the
parliament
of
*NL*
Louis
XV.

and
that

gentlemen
,
I
shall
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
finished
his
speech
,
sat
down
,
and
there
was
a
long
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
good
actor
,
''
thought
Julien
.
He
made
his
usual
mistake
of
*NL*
ascribing
too
much
intelligence
to
the
people
.
Excited
by
the
debates
*NL*
of
so
lively
an
evening
,
and
above
all
by
the
sincerity
of
the
*NL*
discussion
,
M.
de
Nerval
did
at
this
moment
believe
in
his
mission
.
*NL*
This
man
had
great
courage
,
but
at
the
same
time
no
sense
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
silence
that
followed
the
impressive
words
,
``
I
shall
do
it
,
''
*NL*
midnight
struck
.
Julien
thought
that
the
striking
of
the
clock
had
in
*NL*
it
a
certain
element
of
funereal
majesty
.
He
felt
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
discussion
was
soon
resumed
with
increasing
energy
,
and
above
all
*NL*
with
an
incredible
naivety
.
``
These
people
will
have
me
poisoned
,
''
*NL*
thought
Julien
at
times
.
``
How
can
they
say
such
things
before
a
*NL*
plebian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
still
talking
when
two
o'clock
struck
.
The
master
of
the
*NL*
house
had
been
sleeping
for
some
time
.
M.
de
la
Mole
was
obliged
to
*NL*
ring
for
new
candles
.
M.
de
Nerval
,
the
minister
,
had
left
at
the
*NL*
quarter
to
two
,
but
not
without
having
repeatedly
studied
Julien
's
face
*NL*
in
a
mirror
which
was
at
the
minister
's
side
.
His
departure
had
seemed
*NL*
to
put
everybody
at
their
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
bringing
new
candles
,
the
man
in
the
waistcoats
,
*NL*
whispered
to
his
neighbour
:
``
God
knows
what
that
man
will
say
to
the
*NL*
king
.
He
may
throw
ridicule
upon
us
and
spoil
our
future

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
must
own
that
he
must
possess
an
unusual
self-assurance
,
not
to
*NL*
say
impudence
,
to
put
in
an
appearance
here
There
were
signs
of
it
*NL*
before
he
became
a
minister
;
but
a
portfolio
changes
everything
and
*NL*
swamps
all
a
man
's
interests
;
he
must
have
felt
its
effect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
had
scarcely
left
before
the
general
of
Buonaparte
closed
*NL*
his
eyes
.
He
now
talked
of
his
health
and
his
wounds
,
consulted
his
*NL*
watch
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
wager
,
''
said
the
man
in
the
waistcoats
,
``
that
the
general
is
*NL*
running
after
the
minister
;
he
will
apologise
for
having
been
here
and
*NL*
pretend
that
he
is
our
leader
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
now
deliberate
,
gentlemen

said
the
president
,
after
the
*NL*
sleepy
servants
had
finished
bringing
and
lighting
new
candles
.
``
Let
us
*NL*
leave
off
trying
to
persuade
each
other

Let
us
think
of
the
contents

note
which
will
be
read
by
our
friends
outside
in
forty-eight
*NL*
hours
from
now

We
have
heard
ministers
spoken
of

Now
that
M.
de

Nerval
has
left
us

we
are
at
liberty
to
say
`
what
we
do
care

ministers

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
gave
a
subtle
smile
of
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
is
easier
it
seems
to
me
than
summing
up
our
position

said
*NL*
the
young
bishop
of
Agde
,
with
the
restrained
concentrated
fire
of
the
*NL*
most
exalted
fanaticism
.
He
had
kept
silent
up
to
this
time
;
his
eye
,
*NL*
which
Julien
had
noticed
as
being
soft
and
calm
at
the
beginning
,
had
*NL*
become
fiery
during
the
first
hour
of
the
discussion
.
His
soul
was
now
*NL*
bubbling
over
like
lava
from
Vesuvius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
England
only
made
one
mistake
from
1806
to
1814
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
that
*NL*
was
in
not
taking
direct
and
personal
measures
against
Napoleon

As
*NL*
soon
as

had
made
dukes

soon
as
he
had

re-established
the
throne

the
mission
that
God
had
entrusted
to
him

was
finished

The
only
thing
to
do
with
him
was
to
sacrifice
him

more
than

there
were
several
Latin

did
not
leave
with

Mole
before
three
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning

The
marquis
seemed
tired
and
ashamed
.
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
*NL*
in
conversation
with
Julien
,
his
tone
was
plaintive
.
He
asked
him
for
*NL*
his
word
never
to
reveal
the
excesses
of
zeal
,
that
was
his
expression
,
*NL*
of
which
chance
had
just
made
him
a
witness

,
''
said
the
marquis
,
``
as
is
quite
obvious
from
the
lack
*NL*
of
clearness
at
the
end
of
this
note
;
I
am
more
dissatisfied
with
it
*NL*
than
with
anything
I
ever
did
in
my
whole
life
.
Look
here
,
my
friend
,
''
*NL*
he
added
,
``
go
and
rest
for
some
hours
,
and
as
I
am
frightened
you
might
*NL*
be
kidnapped
,
I
shall
lock
you
up
in
your
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
took
Julien
on
the
following
day
to
a
lonely
chateau
at
a
*NL*
good
distance
from
Paris
.
There
were
strange
guests
there
whom
Julien
*NL*
thought
were
priests
.
He
was
given
a
passport
which
was
made
out
in
a
*NL*
fictitious
name
,
but
indicated
the
real
destination
of
his
journey
,
*NL*
which
he
had
always
pretended
not
to
know
.
He
got
into
a
carriage
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
had
no
anxiety
on
the
score
of
his
memory
.
Julien
*NL*
had
recited
the
secret
note
to
him
several
times
but
he
was
very
*NL*
apprehensive
of
his
being
intercepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Above
all
,
mind
you
look
like
a
coxcomb
who
is
simply
travelling
to
*NL*
kill
time
,
''
he
said
affectionately
to
him
when
he
was
leaving
the
*NL*
salon
.
``
Perhaps
there
was
more
than
one
treacherous
brother
in
this
*NL*
evening
's
meeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
journey
was
quick
and
very
melancholy
.
Julien
had
scarcely
got
*NL*
out
of
the
marquis
's
sight
before
he
forgot
his
secret
note
and
his
*NL*
mission
,
and
only
thought
about
Mathilde
's
disdain
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
village
some
leagues
beyond
Metz
,
the
postmaster
came
and
told
him
*NL*
that
there
were
no
horses
.
It
was
ten
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
Julien
*NL*
was
very
annoyed
and
asked
for
supper
.
He
walked
in
front
of
the
door
*NL*
and
gradually
without
being
noticed
passed
into
the
stable-yard
.
He
did
*NL*
not
see
any
horses
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
looked
strange
though
,
''
thought
Julien
to
himself
.
``
He
was
*NL*
scrutinizing
me
with
his
brutal
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
one
sees
he
was
beginning
to
be
slightly
sceptical
of
all
he
heard
.
*NL*
He
thought
of
escaping
after
supper
,
and
in
order
to
learn
at
any
rate
*NL*
something
about
the
surrounding
country
,
he
left
his
room
to
go
and
*NL*
warm
himself
at
the
kitchen
fire
.
He
was
overjoyed
to
find
there
the
*NL*
celebrated
singer
,
signor
Geronimo
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Neopolitan
was
ensconced
in
an
armchair
which
he
had
had
brought
*NL*
near
the
fire
.
He
was
groaning
aloud
,
and
was
speaking
more
to
himself
*NL*
than
to
the
twenty
dumbfounded
German
peasants
who
surrounded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
people
will
be
my
ruin
,
''
he
cried
to
Julien
,
``
I
have
promised
to
*NL*
sing
to-morrow
at
Mayence
.
Seven
sovereign
princes
have
gone
there
to
*NL*
hear
me
.
Let
us
go
and
take
the
air
,
''
he
added
,
meaningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
down
the
road
,
and
it
was
impossible
*NL*
to
be
overheard
,
he
said
to
Julien
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
the
real
truth
,
the
postmaster
is
a
scoundrel
.
When
I
went
*NL*
out
for
a
walk
I
gave
twenty
sous
to
a
little
ragamuffin
who
told
me
*NL*
everything
.
There
are
twelve
horses
in
the
stable
at
the
other
end
of
*NL*
the
village
.
They
want
to
stop
some
courier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
''
said
Julien
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Discovering
the
fraud
was
not
enough
;
the
thing
was
to
get
away
,
but
*NL*
Geronimo
and
his
friends
could
not
succeed
in
doing
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
wait
for
daybreak
,
''
said
the
singer
at
last
,
``
they
are
*NL*
mistrustful
of
us
.
It
is
perhaps
you
or
me
whom
they
suspect
.
We
will
*NL*
order
a
good
breakfast
to-morrow
morning
,
we
will
go
for
a
walk
while
*NL*
they
are
getting
it
ready
,
we
will
then
escape
,
we
will
hire
horses
,
*NL*
and
gain
the
next
station
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
about
your
luggage
?
''
said
Julien
,
who
thought
perhaps
Geronimo
*NL*
himself
might
have
been
sent
to
intercept
him
.
They
had
to
have
supper
*NL*
and
go
to
bed
.
Julien
was
still
in
his
first
sleep
when
he
was
woken
*NL*
up
with
a
start
by
the
voices
of
two
persons
who
were
speaking
in
his
*NL*
room
with
utmost
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
recognised
the
postmaster
armed
with
a
dark
lantern
.
The
light
was
*NL*
turned
on
the
carriage-seat
which
Julien
had
had
taken
up
into
his
*NL*
room
.
Beside
the
postmaster
was
a
man
who
was
calmly
searching
the
open
*NL*
seat
.
Julien
could
see
nothing
except
the
sleeves
of
his
coat
which
*NL*
were
black
and
very
tight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
cassock
,
''
he
said
to
himself
and
he
softly
seized
the
little
*NL*
pistol
which
he
had
placed
under
his
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
frightened
of
his
waking
up
,
cure
,
''
said
the
postmaster
,
``
the
*NL*
wine
that
has
been
served
him
was
the
stuff
prepared
by
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
find
any
trace
of
papers
,
''
answered
the
cure
.
``
A
lot
of
linen
*NL*
and
essences
,
pommades
,
and
vanities
.
It
's
a
young
man
of
the
world
*NL*
on
pleasure
bent
.
The
other
one
who
effects
an
Italian
accent
is
more
*NL*
likely
to
be
the
emissary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
approached
Julien
to
search
the
pockets
of
his
travelling
coat
.
*NL*
He
felt
very
tempted
to
kill
them
for
thieves
.
Nothing
could
be
safer
*NL*
in
its
consequences
.
He
was
very
desirous
of
doing
so
...
``
I
should
*NL*
only
be
a
fool
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
should
compromise
my
mission
.
''
*NL*
``
He
is
not
a
diplomatist
,
''
said
the
priest
after
searching
his
coat
.
He
*NL*
went
away
and
did
well
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
a
bad
business
for
him
,
''
Julien
was
saying
to
himself
,
``
if
*NL*
he
touches
me
in
my
bed
.
He
may
have
quite
well
come
to
stab
me
,
and
I
*NL*
wo
n't
put
up
with
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cure
turned
his
head
,
Julien
half
opened
his
eyes
.
He
was
*NL*
inordinately
astonished
,
he
was
the
abbe
Castanede
.
As
a
matter
of
*NL*
fact
,
although
these
two
persons
had
made
a
point
of
talking
in
a
*NL*
fairly
low
voice
,
he
had
thought
from
the
first
that
he
recognised
one
*NL*
of
the
voices
.
Julien
was
seized
with
an
inordinate
desire
to
purge
the
*NL*
earth
of
one
of
its
most
cowardly
villains
;
``
But
my
mission
,
''
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cure
and
his
acolyte
went
out
.
A
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
*NL*
Julien
pretended
to
have
just
woken
up
.
He
called
out
and
woke
up
the
*NL*
whole
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
poisoned
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
I
am
suffering
horribly
!
''
He
wanted
an
*NL*
excuse
to
go
to
Geronimo
's
help
.
He
found
him
half
suffocated
by
the
*NL*
laudanum
that
had
been
contained
in
the
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
been
apprehensive
of
some
trick
of
this
character
and
had
*NL*
supped
on
some
chocolate
which
he
had
brought
from
Paris
.
He
could
not
*NL*
wake
Geronimo
up
sufficiently
to
induce
him
to
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
were
to
give
me
the
whole
kingdom
of
Naples
,
''
said
the
singer
,
*NL*
``
I
would
not
now
give
up
the
pleasure
of
sleeping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
seven
sovereign
princes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
left
alone
,
and
arrived
at
the
house
of
the
great
personage
*NL*
without
other
incident
.
He
wasted
a
whole
morning
in
vainly
soliciting
*NL*
an
audience
.
Fortunately
about
four
o'clock
the
duke
wanted
to
take
*NL*
the
air
.
Julien
saw
him
go
out
on
foot
and
he
did
not
hesitate
*NL*
to
ask
him
for
alms
.
When
at
two
yards
'
distance
from
the
great
*NL*
personage
he
pulled
out
the
Marquis
de
la
Mole
's
watch
and
exhibited
*NL*
it
ostentatiously
.
''
_
Follow
me
at
a
distance
_
,
''
said
the
man
without
*NL*
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
quarter
of
a
league
's
distance
the
duke
suddenly
entered
a
little
*NL*
_
coffee-house
_
.
It
was
in
a
room
of
this
low
class
inn
that
Julien
had
*NL*
the
honour
of
reciting
his
four
pages
to
the
duke
.
When
he
had
finished
*NL*
he
was
told
to
''
_
start
again
and
go
more
slowly
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
took
notes
.
``
Reach
the
next
posting
station
on
foot
.
Leave
*NL*
your
luggage
and
your
carriage
here
.
Get
to
Strasbourg
as
best
you
can
*NL*
and
at
half-past
twelve
on
the
twenty-second
of
the
month
-LRB-
it
was
at
*NL*
present
the
tenth
-RRB-
come
to
this
same
coffee-house
.
Do
not
leave
for
*NL*
half-an-hour
.
Silence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
only
words
which
Julien
heard
.
They
sufficed
to
inspire
*NL*
him
with
the
highest
admiration
.
``
That
is
the
way
,
''
he
thought
,
``
that
*NL*
real
business
is
done
;
what
would
this
great
statesman
say
if
he
were
*NL*
to
listen
to
the
impassioned
ranters
heard
three
days
ago
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
took
two
days
to
reach
Strasbourg
.
He
thought
he
would
have
*NL*
nothing
to
do
there
.
He
made
a
great
detour
.
``
If
that
devil
of
an
abbe
*NL*
Castanede
has
recognised
me
he
is
not
the
kind
of
man
to
loose
track
*NL*
of
me
easily
...
And
how
he
would
revel
in
making
a
fool
of
me
,
and
*NL*
causing
my
mission
to
fail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
the
abbe
Castanede
,
who
was
chief
of
the
congregational
*NL*
police
on
all
the
northern
frontier
had
not
recognised
him
.
And
the
*NL*
Strasbourg
Jesuits
,
although
very
zealous
,
never
gave
a
thought
to
*NL*
observing
Julien
,
who
with
his
cross
and
his
blue
tail-coat
looked
*NL*
like
a
young
military
man
,
very
much
engrossed
in
his
own
personal
*NL*
appearance
.

all

With

--
_
Ode
of
Schiller
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
compelled
to
spend
eight
days
in
Strasbourg
and
tried
to
*NL*
distract
himself
by
thoughts
of
military
glory
and
patriotic
devotion
.
*NL*
Was
he
in
love
then
?
he
could
not
tell
,
he
only
felt
in
his
tortured
*NL*
soul
that
Mathilde
was
the
absolute
mistress
both
of
his
happiness
*NL*
and
of
his
imagination
.
He
needed
all
the
energy
of
his
character
*NL*
to
keep
himself
from
sinking
into
despair
.
It
was
out
of
his
power
*NL*
to
think
of
anything
unconnected
with
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
His
*NL*
ambition
and
his
simple
personal
successes
had
formerly
distracted
him
*NL*
from
the
sentiments
which
madame
de
Renal
had
inspired
.
Mathilde
was
*NL*
all-absorbing
;
she
loomed
large
over
his
whole
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
saw
failure
in
every
phase
of
that
future
.
This
same
individual
*NL*
whom
we
remember
to
have
been
so
presumptuous
and
haughty
at
Verrieres
,
*NL*
had
fallen
into
an
excess
of
grotesque
modesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
ago
he
would
only
have
been
too
pleased
to
have
killed
the
*NL*
abbe
Castanede
,
and
now
,
at
Strasbourg
,
if
a
child
had
picked
a
quarrel
*NL*
with
him
he
would
have
thought
the
child
was
in
the
right
.
In
thinking
*NL*
again
about
the
adversaries
and
enemies
whom
he
had
met
in
his
life
he
*NL*
always
thought
that
he
,
Julien
,
had
been
in
the
wrong
.
The
fact
was
*NL*
that
the
same
powerful
imagination
which
had
formerly
been
continuously
*NL*
employed
in
painting
a
successful
future
in
the
most
brilliant
colours
*NL*
had
now
been
transformed
into
his
implacable
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
absolute
solicitude
of
a
traveller
's
life
increased
the
ascendancy
*NL*
of
this
sinister
imagination
.
What
a
boon
a
friend
would
have
been
!
*NL*
But
Julien
said
to
himself
,
``
Is
there
a
single
heart
which
beats
with
*NL*
affection
for
me
?
And
even
if
I
did
have
a
friend
,
would
not
honour
*NL*
enjoin
me
to
eternal
silence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
riding
gloomily
in
the
outskirts
of
Kehl
;
it
is
a
market
town
*NL*
on
the
banks
of
the
Rhine
and
immortalised
by
Desaix
and
Gouvion
*NL*
Saint-Cyr
.
A
German
peasant
showed
him
the
little
brooks
,
roads
and
*NL*
islands
of
the
Rhine
,
which
have
acquired
a
name
through
the
courage
of
*NL*
these
great
generals
.
Julien
was
guiding
his
horse
with
his
left
hand
,
*NL*
while
he
held
unfolded
in
his
right
the
superb
map
which
adorns
the
*NL*
_
Memoirs
of
the
Marshal
Saint
Cyr
_
.
A
merry
exclamation
made
him
lift
*NL*
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
Prince
Korasoff
,
that
London
friend
of
his
,
who
had
*NL*
initiated
him
some
months
before
into
the
elementary
rules
of
high
*NL*
fatuity
.
Faithful
to
his
great
art
,
Korasoff
,
who
had
just
arrived
at
*NL*
Strasbourg
,
had
been
one
hour
in
Kehl
and
had
never
read
a
single
line
*NL*
in
his
whole
life
about
the
siege
of
1796
,
began
to
explain
it
all
to
*NL*
Julien
.
The
German
peasant
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
;
for
he
knew
*NL*
enough
French
to
appreciate
the
enormous
blunders
which
the
prince
was
*NL*
making
.
Julien
was
a
thousand
leagues
away
from
the
peasant
's
thoughts
.
*NL*
He
was
looking
in
astonishment
at
the
handsome
young
man
and
admiring
*NL*
his
grace
in
sitting
a
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
lucky
temperament
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
and
how
his
trousers
*NL*
suit
him
and
how
elegantly
his
hair
is
cut
!
Alas
,
if
I
had
been
like
*NL*
him
,
it
might
have
been
that
she
would
not
have
come
to
dislike
me
*NL*
after
loving
me
for
three
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
prince
had
finished
his
siege
of
Kehl
,
he
said
to
Julien
,
*NL*
``
You
look
like
a
Trappist
,
you
are
carrying
to
excess
that
principle
*NL*
of
gravity
which
I
enjoined
upon
you
in
London
.
A
melancholy
manner
*NL*
can
not
be
good
form
.
What
is
wanted
is
an
air
of
boredom
.
If
you
are
*NL*
melancholy
,
it
is
because
you
lack
something
,
because
you
have
failed
*NL*
in
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
means
showing
one
's
own
inferiority
;
if
,
on
the
other
hand
you
*NL*
are
bored
,
it
is
only
what
has
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
please
*NL*
you
,
which
is
inferior
.
So
realise
,
my
dear
friend
,
the
enormity
of
*NL*
your
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
tossed
a
crown
to
the
gaping
peasant
who
was
listening
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
the
prince
,
``
that
shows
grace
and
a
noble
disdain
,
very
*NL*
good
!
''
And
he
put
his
horse
to
the
gallop
.
Full
of
a
stupid
admiration
,
*NL*
Julien
followed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
if
I
have
been
like
that
,
she
would
not
have
preferred
Croisenois
*NL*
to
me
!
''
The
more
his
reason
was
offended
by
the
grotesque
affectations
*NL*
of
the
prince
the
more
he
despised
himself
for
not
having
them
.
It
was
*NL*
impossible
for
self-disgust
to
be
carried
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
still
finding
him
distinctly
melancholy
,
said
to
him
as
they
*NL*
re-entered
Strasbourg
,
``
Come
,
my
dear
fellow
,
have
you
lost
all
your
*NL*
money
,
or
perhaps
you
are
in
love
with
some
little
actress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Russians
copy
French
manners
,
but
always
at
an
interval
of
fifty
*NL*
years
.
They
have
now
reached
the
age
of
Louis
XV
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
jests
about
love
brought
the
tears
to
Julien
's
eyes
.
``
Why
should
*NL*
I
not
consult
this
charming
man
,
''
he
suddenly
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
he
said
to
the
prince
,
``
you
see
in
me
a
*NL*
man
who
is
very
much
in
love
and
jilted
into
the
bargain
.
A
charming
*NL*
woman
who
lives
in
a
neighbouring
town
has
left
me
stranded
here
after
*NL*
three
passionate
days
,
and
the
change
kills
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Using
fictitious
names
,
he
described
to
the
prince
Mathilde
's
conduct
*NL*
and
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
finish
,
''
said
Korasoff
.
``
In
order
to
give
you
confidence
*NL*
in
your
doctor
,
I
will
finish
the
story
you
have
confided
to
me
.
This
*NL*
young
woman
's
husband
enjoys
an
enormous
income
,
or
even
more
probably
,
*NL*
she
belongs
herself
to
the
high
nobility
of
the
district
.
She
must
be
*NL*
proud
about
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
nodded
his
head
,
he
had
no
longer
the
courage
to
speak
.
``
Very
*NL*
good
,
''
said
the
prince
,
``
here
are
three
fairly
bitter
pills
that
you
*NL*
will
take
without
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

See
madame

What
is
her
name

any
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Dubois
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
name
!
''
said
the
prince
bursting
into
laughter
.
``
But
forgive
me
,
*NL*
you
find
it
sublime
.
Your
tactics
must
be
to
see
Madame
de
Dubois
every
*NL*
day
;
above
all
do
not
appear
to
be
cold
and
piqued
.
Remember
the
great
*NL*
principle
of
your
century
:
be
the
opposite
of
what
is
expected
.
Be
*NL*
exactly
as
you
were
the
week
before
you
were
honoured
by
her
favours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
was
calm
enough
then
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
in
despair
,
``
I
thought
I
*NL*
was
taking
pity
on
her
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
moth
is
burning
itself
at
the
candle
,
''
continued
the
prince
using
*NL*
a
metaphor
as
old
as
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
1
.
You
will
see
her
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

.
You
will
pay
court
to
a
woman
in
her
own
set
,
but
without
*NL*
manifesting
a
passion
,
do
you
understand
?
I
do
not
disguise
from
*NL*
you
that
your
role
is
difficult
;
you
are
playing
a
part
,
and
if
she
*NL*
realises
you
are
playing
it
you
are
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
so
much
intelligence
and
I
have
so
little
,
I
shall
be
lost
,

*NL*
said
Julien
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
are
only
more
in
love
than
I
thought
.
Madame
de
Dubois
is
*NL*
preoccupied
with
herself
as
are
all
women
who
have
been
favoured
*NL*
by
heaven
either
with
too
much
pedigree
or
too
much
money
.
She
*NL*
contemplates
herself
instead
of
contemplating
you
,
consequently
she
*NL*
does
not
know
you
.
During
the
two
or
three
fits
of
love
into
which
she
*NL*
managed
to
work
herself
for
your
especial
benefit
,
she
saw
in
you
the
*NL*
hero
of
her
dreams
,
and
not
the
man
you
really
are
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
deuce
take
it
,
this
is
elementary

my
dear
Sorel

are
you
an
*NL*
absolute
novice
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oddslife

Let
us
go
into
this
shop

Look
at
that
charming
black
*NL*
cravat

one
would
say
it
was
made
by
John
Anderson
of
Burlington
*NL*
Street

Be
kind
enough

take
it

throw
far
away

awful
black

cord
which
you
are
wearing
round
your
neck

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
continued
the
prince
as
they
came
out
of
the
shop
of
the
*NL*
first
hosier
of
Strasbourg
,
``
what
is
the
society
in
which
madame
de
*NL*
Dubois
lives
?
Great
God

n't
be
angry
,
my
dear
Sorel

I
*NL*
ca

it

Now
,
whom
are
you
going
to
pay
court
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
an
absolute
prude
,
the
daughter
of
an
immensely
rich
*NL*
stocking-merchant
.
She
has
the
finest
eyes
in
the
world
and
they
please
*NL*
me
infinitely
;
she
doubtless
holds
the
highest
place
in
the
society
*NL*
of
the
district
,
but
in
the
midst
of
all
her
greatness
she
blushes
*NL*
and
becomes
positively
confused
if
anyone
starts
talking
about
trade
*NL*
or
shops
.
And
,
unfortunately
,
her
father
was
one
of
the
best
known
*NL*
merchants
in
Strasbourg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
said
the
prince
with
a
laugh
,
``
you
are
sure
that
when
one
talks
*NL*
about
trade
your
fair
lady
thinks
about
herself
and
not
about
you
.
This
*NL*
silly
weakness
is
divine
and
extremely
useful
,
it
will
prevent
you
*NL*
from
yielding
to
a
single
moment
's
folly
when
near
her
sparkling
eyes
.
*NL*
Success
is
assured
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
thinking
of
madame
the
marechale
de
Fervaques
who
often
*NL*
came
to
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
.
She
was
a
beautiful
foreigner
who
had
*NL*
married
the
marechal
a
year
before
his
death
.
The
one
object
of
her
*NL*
whole
life
seemed
to
be
to
make
people
forget
that
she
was
the
daughter
*NL*
of
a
manufacturer
.
In
order
to
cut
some
figure
in
Paris
she
had
placed
*NL*
herself
at
the
head
of
the
party
of
piety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
sincerely
admired
the
prince
;
what
would
he
not
have
given
to
*NL*
have
possessed
his
affectations
!
The
conversation
between
the
two
*NL*
friends
was
interminable
.
Korasoff
was
delighted
:
No
Frenchman
had
ever
*NL*
listened
to
him
for
so
long
.
``
So
I
have
succeeded
at
last
,
''
said
the
*NL*
prince
to
himself
complacently
,
``
in
getting
a
proper
hearing
and
that
*NL*
too
through
giving
lessons
to
my
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
are
quite
agreed
,
''
he
repeated
to
Julien
for
the
tenth
time
.
*NL*
``
When
you
talk
to
the
young
beauty
,
I
mean
the
daughter
of
the
*NL*
Strasbourg
stocking
merchant
in
the
presence
of
madame
de
Dubois
,
not
*NL*
a
trace
of
passion
.
But
on
the
other
hand
be
ardently
passionate
when
*NL*
you
write
.
Reading
a
well-written
love-letter
is
a
prude
's
supremest
*NL*
pleasure
.
It
is
a
moment
of
relaxation
.
She
leaves
off
posing
and
dares
*NL*
to
listen
to
her
own
heart
;
consequently
two
letters
a
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
never
,
''
said
Julien
despondently
,
``
I
would
rather
be
ground
in
*NL*
a
mortar
than
make
up
three
phrases

I
am
a
corpse

hope
nothing
from
me

me
die

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
talking

up
phrases

have
got
six
volumes

copied-out
love-letters
in
my
bag

I
have
letters
to
suit
every
*NL*
variation
of
feminine
character
,
including
the
most
highly
virtuous
.
*NL*
Did
not
Kalisky
pay
court
at
Richmond-on-the-Thames
at
three
leagues
*NL*
from
London
,
you
know
,
to
the
prettiest
Quakeress
in
the
whole
of
*NL*
England
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
less
unhappy
when
he
left
his
friend
at
two
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
summoned
a
copyist
on
the
following
day
,
and
two
days
*NL*
afterwards
Julien
was
the
possessor
of
fifty-three
carefully
numbered
*NL*
love-letters
intended
for
the
most
sublime
and
the
most
melancholy
*NL*
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
reason
why
there
is
not
fifty-four
,
''
said
the
prince
``
is
because
*NL*
Kalisky
allowed
himself
to
be
dismissed

But
what
does
it
matter
to
*NL*
you
,
if
you
are
badly
treated
by
the
stocking-merchant
's
daughter
since
*NL*
you
only
wish
to
produce
an
impression
upon
madame
de
Dubois
'
heart

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
riding
every
day
,
the
prince
was
mad
on
Julien
.
Not
*NL*
knowing
how
else
to
manifest
his
sudden
friendship
,
he
finished
up
by
*NL*
offering
him
the
hand
of
one
of
his
cousins
,
a
rich
Moscow
heiress
;
*NL*
``
and
once
married
,
''
he
added
,
``
my
influence
and
that
cross
of
yours
*NL*
will
get
you
made
a
Colonel
within
two
years
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that

was
not
given
me
by
Napoleon

far
from
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
matter

''
said
the
prince
,
``
did
n't
he
invent
it

It
is
*NL*
still
the
first
in
Europe
by
a
long
way

''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
on
the
point
of
accepting
;
but
his
duty
called
him
back
to
*NL*
the
great
personage
.
When
he
left
Korasoff
he
promised
to
write
.
He
*NL*
received
the
answer
to
the
secret
note
which
he
had
brought
,
and
posted
*NL*
towards
Paris
;
but
he
had
scarcely
been
alone
for
two
successive
days
*NL*
before
leaving
France
,
and
Mathilde
seemed
a
worse
punishment
than
*NL*
death
.
``
I
will
not
marry
the
millions
Korasoff
offers
me
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
and
I
will
follow
his

After
all

*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
our
hero
had
returned
to
Paris
and
had
come
out
of
the
*NL*
study
of
the
marquis
de
La
Mole
,
who
seemed
very
displeased
with
the
*NL*
despatches
that
were
given
him
,
he
rushed
off
for
the
comte
Altamira
.
*NL*
This
noble
foreigner
combined
with
the
advantage
of
having
once
been
*NL*
condemned
to
death
a
very
grave
demeanour
together
with
the
good
*NL*
fortune
of
a
devout
temperament
;
these
two
qualities
,
and
more
than
*NL*
anything
,
the
comte
's
high
birth
,
made
an
especial
appeal
to
madame
de
*NL*
Fervaques
who
saw
a
lot
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
solemnly
confessed
to
him
that
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
virtue
is
the
purest
and
the
highest
,
''
answered
Altamira
,
``
only
it
*NL*
is
a
little
Jesuitical
and
dogmatic

*NL*
``
There
are
days
when

though
I
understand
each
of
the
expressions

she
makes
use

understand
the
whole

She
often
*NL*
makes
me
think
that
I
do
not
know
French
as
well
as
I
am
said
to
.
But
*NL*
your
acquaintance
with
her
will
get
you
talked
about
;
it
will
give
you
*NL*
weight
in
the
world
.
But
let
us
go
to
Bustos
,
''
said
Count
Altamira
*NL*
who
had
a
methodical
turn
of
mind
;
``
he
once
paid
court
to
madame
la
*NL*
marechale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Diego
Bustos
had
the
matter
explained
to
him
at
length
,
while
he
*NL*
said
nothing
,
like
a
barrister
in
his
chambers
.
He
had
a
big
monk-like
*NL*
face
with
black
moustaches
and
an
inimitable
gravity
;
he
was
,
however
,
*NL*
a
good
carbonaro
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
he
said
to
Julien
at
last
.
``
Has
the
marechale
de
*NL*
Fervaques
had
lovers
,
or
has
she
not
?
Have
you
consequently
any
hope
*NL*
of
success
?
That
is
the
question
.
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
,
for
my
own
*NL*
part
,
that
I
have
failed
.
Now
that
I
am
no
more
piqued
I
reason
it
out
*NL*
to
myself
in
this
way
;
she
is
often
bad
tempered
,
and
as
I
will
tell
*NL*
you
in
a
minute
,
she
is
quite
vindictive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fail
to
detect
in
her
that
bilious
temperament
which
is
the
sign
of
*NL*
genius
,
and
shows
as
it
were
a
veneer
of
passion
over
all
its
actions
.
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
she
owes
her
rare
beauty
and
her
fresh
complexion
to
*NL*
the
phlegmatic
,
tranquil
character
of
the
Dutch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
began
to
lose
patience
with
the
phlegmatic
slowness
of
the
*NL*
imperturbable
Spaniard
;
he
could
not
help
giving
vent
to
some
*NL*
monosyllables
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
listen
to
me
?
''
Don
Diego
Bustos
gravely
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
the
_
furia
franchese
_
;
I
am
all
ears
,
''
said
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
marechale
de
Fervaques
then
is
a
great
hater
;
she
persecutes
*NL*
ruthlessly
people
she
has
never
seen
--
advocates
,
poor
devils
of
men
of
*NL*
letters
who
have
composed
songs
like
Colle
,
you
know
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
J'ai
la
marotte
*NL*
D'aimer
Marote
,
etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Julien
had
to
put
up
with
the
whole
quotation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spaniard
was
very
pleased
to
get
a
chance
of
singing
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
divine
song
was
never
listened
to
more
impatiently
.
When
it
was
*NL*
finished
Don
Diego
said
--
``
The
marechale
procured
the
dismissal
of
the
*NL*
author
of
the
song
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Un
jour
l'amour
au
cabaret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
shuddered
lest
he
should
want
to
sing
it
.
He
contented
himself
*NL*
with
analysing
it
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
it
was
blasphemous
and
somewhat
*NL*
indecent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
marechale
become
enraged
against
that
song
,
''
said
Don
Diego
,
*NL*
``
I
remarked
to
her
that
a
woman
of
her
rank
ought
not
to
read
all
the
*NL*
stupid
things
that
are
published
.
Whatever
progress
piety
and
gravity
*NL*
may
make
France
will
always
have
a
cabaret
literature
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Be
careful
,
'
I
said
to
madame
de
Fervaques
when
she
had
succeeded
*NL*
in
depriving
the
author
,
a
poor
devil
on
half-pay
,
of
a
place
worth
*NL*
eighteen
hundred
francs
a
year
,
`
you
have
attacked
this
rhymster
with
*NL*
your
own
arms
,
he
may
answer
you
with
his
rhymes
;
he
will
make
a
song
*NL*
about
virtue
.
The
gilded
salons
will
be
on
your
side
;
but
people
who
*NL*
like
to
laugh
will
repeat
his
epigrams
.
'
Do
you
know
,
monsieur
,
what
*NL*
the
marechale
answered
?
`
Let
all
Paris
come
and
see
me
walking
to
my
*NL*
martyrdom
for
the
sake
of
the
Lord
.
It
will
be
a
new
spectacle
for
*NL*
France
.
The
people
will
learn
to
respect
the
quality
.
It
will
be
the
*NL*
finest
day
of
my
life
.
'
Her
eyes
never
looked
finer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
has
superb
ones
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
that
you
are
in
love
.
Further
,
''
went
on
Don
Diego
Bustos
*NL*
gravely
,
``
she
has
not
the
bilious
constitution
which
causes
*NL*
vindictiveness
.
If
,
however
,
she
likes
to
do
harm
,
it
is
because
she
is
*NL*
unhappy
,
I
suspect
some
secret
misfortune
.
May
it
not
be
quite
well
a
*NL*
case
of
prude
tired
of
her
role
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spaniard
looked
at
him
in
silence
for
a
good
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
whole
point
,
''
he
added
gravely
,
``
and
that
's
what
may
give
*NL*
you
ground
for
some
hope
.
I
have
often
reflected
about
it
during
the
*NL*
two
years
that
I
was
her
very
humble
servant
.
All
your
future
,
my
*NL*
amorous
sir
,
depends
on
this
great
problem
.
Is
she
a
prude
tired
of
her
*NL*
role
and
only
malicious
because
she
is
unhappy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
,
''
said
Altamira
emerging
at
last
from
his
deep
silence
,
``
can
it
be
*NL*
as
I
have
said
twenty
times
before
,
simply
a
case
of
French
vanity
;
the
*NL*
memory
of
her
father
,
the
celebrated
cloth
merchant
,
constitutes
the
*NL*
unhappiness
of
this
frigid
melancholy
nature
.
The
only
happiness
she
*NL*
could
find
would
be
to
live
in
Toledo
and
to
be
tortured
by
a
confessor
*NL*
who
would
show
her
hell
wide
open
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Altamira
informs
me
you
are
one
of
us
,
''
said
Don
Diego
,
whose
*NL*
demeanour
was
growing
graver
and
graver
to
Julien
as
he
went
out
.
``
You
*NL*
will
help
us
one
day
in
re-winning
our
liberty
,
so
I
would
like
to
help
*NL*
you
in
this
little
amusement
.
It
is
right
that
you
should
know
the
*NL*
marechale
's
style
;
here
are
four
letters
in
her
hand-writing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
copy
them
out
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
``
and
bring
them
back
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
never
let
anyone
know
a
word
of
what
we
have
been
*NL*
saying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
on
my
honour
,
''
cried
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
God
help
you
,
''
added
the
Spaniard
,
and
he
silently
escorted
*NL*
Altamira
and
Julien
as
far
as
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
somewhat
amused
our
hero
;
he
was
on
the
point
of
smiling
.
``
So
*NL*
we
have
the
devout
Altamira
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
aiding
me
in
an
*NL*
adulterous
enterprise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
Don
Diego
's
solemn
conversation
Julien
had
been
attentive
to
the
*NL*
hours
struck
by
the
clock
of
the
Hotel
d'Aligre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
hour
was
drawing
near
,
he
was
going
to
see
Mathilde
again
.
*NL*
He
went
in
and
dressed
with
much
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mistake
No.
1
,
''
he
said
to
himself
as
he
descended
the
staircase
:
``
I
*NL*
must
follow
the
prince
's
instructions
to
the
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
up
to
his
room
again
and
put
on
a
travelling
suit
which
was
as
*NL*
simple
as
it
could
be
.
``
All
I
have
to
do
now
,
''
he
thought
,
``
is
to
keep
*NL*
control
of
my
expression
.
''
It
was
only
half-past
five
and
they
dined
at
*NL*
six
.
He
thought
of
going
down
to
the
salon
which
he
found
deserted
.
He
*NL*
was
moved
to
the
point
of
tears
at
the
sight
of
the
blue
sofa
.
``
I
must
*NL*
make
an
end
of
this
foolish
sensitiveness
,
''
he
said
angrily
,
``
it
will
*NL*
betray
me
.
''
He
took
up
a
paper
in
order
to
keep
himself
in
countenance
*NL*
and
passed
three
or
four
times
from
the
salon
into
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
when
he
was
well
concealed
by
a
large
oak
and
was
trembling
*NL*
all
over
,
that
he
ventured
to
raise
his
eyes
at
mademoiselle
de
la
*NL*
Mole
's
window
.
It
was
hermetically
sealed
;
he
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
fainting
and
remained
for
a
long
time
leaning
against
the
oak
;
then
*NL*
with
a
staggering
step
he
went
to
have
another
look
at
the
gardener
's
*NL*
ladder
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chain
which
he
had
once
forced
asunder
--
in
,
alas
,
such
different
*NL*
circumstances
--
had
not
yet
been
repaired
.
Carried
away
by
a
moment
of
*NL*
madness
,
Julien
pressed
it
to
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
having
wandered
about
for
a
long
time
between
the
salon
and
the
*NL*
garden
,
Julien
felt
horribly
tired
;
he
was
now
feeling
acutely
the
*NL*
effects
of
a
first
success
.
My
eyes
will
be
expressionless
and
will
not
*NL*
betray
me
!
The
guests
gradually
arrived
in
the
salon
;
the
door
never
*NL*
opened
without
instilling
anxiety
into
Julien
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
at
table
.
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
always
faithful
to
her
*NL*
habit
of
keeping
people
waiting
,
eventually
appeared
.
She
blushed
a
*NL*
great
deal
on
seeing
Julien
,
she
had
not
been
told
of
his
arrival
.
In
*NL*
accordance
with
Prince
Korasoff
's
recommendation
,
Julien
looked
at
his
*NL*
hands
.
They
were
trembling
.
Troubled
though
he
was
beyond
words
by
this
*NL*
discovery
,
he
was
sufficiently
happy
to
look
merely
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
la
Mole
sang
his
praises
.
The
marquise
spoke
to
him
a
minute
*NL*
afterwards
and
complimented
him
on
his
tired
appearance
.
Julien
said
to
*NL*
himself
at
every
minute
,
``
I
ought
not
to
look
too
much
at
mademoiselle
*NL*
de
la
Mole
,
I
ought
not
to
avoid
looking
at
her
too
much
either
.
I
must
*NL*
appear
as
I
was
eight
days
before
my
unhappiness
--
''
He
had
occasion
*NL*
to
be
satisfied
with
his
success
and
remained
in
the
salon
.
Paying
*NL*
attention
for
the
first
time
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
he
made
*NL*
every
effort
to
make
the
visitors
speak
and
to
keep
the
conversation
*NL*
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
politeness
was
rewarded
;
madame
la
marechale
de
Fervaques
was
*NL*
announced
about
eight
o'clock
.
Julien
retired
and
shortly
afterwards
*NL*
appeared
dressed
with
the
greatest
care
.
Madame
de
la
Mole
was
*NL*
infinitely
grateful
to
him
for
this
mark
of
respect
and
made
a
point
*NL*
of
manifesting
her
satisfaction
by
telling
madame
de
Fervaques
about
*NL*
his
journey
.
Julien
established
himself
near
the
marechale
in
such
a
*NL*
position
that
Mathilde
could
not
notice
his
eyes
.
In
this
position
he
*NL*
lavished
in
accordance
with
all
the
rules
in
the
art
of
love
,
the
most
*NL*
abject
admiration
on
madame
de
Fervaques
.
The
first
of
the
53
letters
*NL*
with
which
Prince
Korasoff
had
presented
him
commenced
with
a
tirade
on
*NL*
this
sentiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marechale
announced
that
she
was
going
to
the
Opera-Bouffe
.
Julien
*NL*
rushed
there
.
He
ran
across
the
Chevalier
de
Beauvoisis
who
took
him
*NL*
into
a
box
occupied
by
Messieurs
the
Gentlemen
of
the
Chamber
,
just
*NL*
next
to
madame
de
Fervaques
's
box
.
Julien
constantly
looked
at
her
.
``
I
*NL*
must
keep
a
siege-journal
,
''
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
back
to
the
*NL*
hotel
,
``
otherwise
I
shall
forget
my
attacks
.
''
He
wrote
two
or
three
*NL*
pages
on
this
boring
theme
,
and
in
this
way
achieved
the
admirable
*NL*
result
of
scarcely
thinking
at
all
about
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
had
almost
forgotten
him
during
his
journey
.
``
He
is
simply
*NL*
a
commonplace
person
after
all
,
''
she
thought
,
``
his
name
will
always
*NL*
recall
to
me
the
greatest
mistake
in
my
life
.
I
must
honestly
go
back
*NL*
to
all
my
ideas
about
prudence
and
honour
;
a
woman
who
forgets
them
has
*NL*
everything
to
lose
.
''
She
showed
herself
inclined
to
allow
the
contract
*NL*
with
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
,
which
had
been
prepared
so
long
ago
,
to
*NL*
be
at
last
concluded
.
He
was
mad
with
joy
;
he
would
have
been
very
much
*NL*
astonished
had
he
been
told
that
there
was
an
element
of
resignation
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
those
feelings
of
Mathilde
which
made
him
so
proud
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
ideas
changed
when
she
saw
Julien
.
``
As
a
*NL*
matter
of
fact
he
is
my
husband
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
If
I
am
sincere
*NL*
in
my
return
to
sensible
notions
,
he
is
clearly
the
man
I
ought
to
*NL*
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
expecting
importunities
and
airs
of
unhappiness
on
the
part
of
*NL*
Julien
;
she
commenced
rehearsing
her
answers
,
for
he
would
doubtless
*NL*
try
to
address
some
words
to
her
when
they
left
the
dinner
table
.
Far
*NL*
from
that
he
remained
stubbornly
in
the
salon
and
did
not
even
look
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
garden
,
though
God
knows
what
pain
that
caused
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
better
to
have
this
explanation
out
all
at
once
,
''
thought
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
;
she
went
into
the
garden
alone
,
Julien
did
not
*NL*
appear
.
Mathilde
went
and
walked
near
the
salon
window
.
She
found
him
*NL*
very
much
occupied
in
describing
to
madame
de
Fervaques
the
old
ruined
*NL*
chateau
which
crown
the
banks
along
the
Rhine
and
invest
them
with
so
*NL*
much
atmosphere
.
He
was
beginning
to
acquit
himself
with
some
credit
*NL*
in
that
sentimental
picturesque
jargon
which
is
called
wit
in
certain
*NL*
salons
.
Prince
Korasoff
would
have
been
very
proud
if
he
had
been
at
*NL*
Paris
.
This
evening
was
exactly
what
he
had
predicted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
approved
the
line
of
conduct
which
Julien
followed
on
the
*NL*
subsequent
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
intrigue
among
the
members
of
the
secret
government
was
going
to
*NL*
bestow
a
few
blue
ribbons
;
madame
marechale
de
Fervaques
was
insisting
*NL*
on
her
great
uncle
being
made
a
chevalier
of
the
order
.
The
marquis
de
*NL*
la
Mole
had
the
same
pretensions
for
his
father-in-law
;
they
joined
*NL*
forces
and
the
marechale
came
to
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
nearly
every
day
.
*NL*
It
was
from
her
that
Julien
learned
that
the
marquis
was
going
to
be
*NL*
a
minister
.
He
was
offering
to
the
_
Camarilla
_
a
very
ingenious
plan
*NL*
for
the
annihilation
of
the
charter
within
three
years
without
any
*NL*
disturbance
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
M.
de
la
Mole
became
a
minister
,
Julien
could
hope
for
a
bishopric
:
*NL*
but
all
these
important
interests
seemed
to
be
veiled
and
hazy
.
His
*NL*
imagination
only
perceived
them
very
vaguely
,
and
so
to
speak
,
in
*NL*
the
far
distance
.
The
awful
unhappiness
which
was
making
him
into
a
*NL*
madman
could
find
no
other
interest
in
life
except
the
character
of
his
*NL*
relations
with
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
He
calculated
that
after
five
*NL*
or
six
careful
years
he
would
manage
to
get
himself
loved
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
cold
brain
had
been
reduced
,
as
one
sees
,
to
a
state
of
complete
*NL*
disorder
.
Out
of
all
the
qualities
which
had
formerly
distinguished
*NL*
him
,
all
that
remained
was
a
little
firmness
.
He
was
literally
faithful
*NL*
to
the
line
of
conduct
which
prince
Korasoff
had
dictated
,
and
placed
*NL*
himself
every
evening
near
madame
Fervaques
'
armchair
,
but
he
found
it
*NL*
impossible
to
think
of
a
word
to
say
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strain
of
making
Mathilde
think
that
he
had
recovered
exhausted
his
*NL*
whole
moral
force
,
and
when
he
was
with
the
marechale
he
seemed
almost
*NL*
lifeless
;
even
his
eyes
had
lost
all
their
fire
,
as
in
cases
of
extreme
*NL*
physical
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
madame
de
la
Mole
's
views
were
invariably
a
counterpart
of
the
*NL*
opinions
of
that
husband
of
hers
who
could
make
her
into
a
Duchess
,
she
*NL*
had
been
singing
Julien
's
praises
for
some
days
.

That

Which
ne'er

the
equinoctial

Of
anything
which
Nature

Just
as

finds
nothing

At

his

suffers
not

anything

can
greatly
please

*NL*
``
There
is
an
element
of
madness
in
all
this
family
's
way
of
looking
at
*NL*
things
,
''
thought
the
marechale
;
``
they
are
infatuated
with
their
young
*NL*
abbe
,
whose
only
accomplishment
is
to
be
a
good
listener
,
though
his
*NL*
eyes
are
fine
enough
,
it
is
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
,
on
his
side
,
found
in
the
marechale
's
manners
an
almost
perfect
*NL*
instance
of
that
patrician
calm
which
exhales
a
scrupulous
politeness
;
*NL*
and
,
what
is
more
,
announces
at
the
same
time
the
impossibility
of
*NL*
any
violent
emotion
.
Madame
de
Fervaques
would
have
been
as
much
*NL*
scandalised
by
any
unexpected
movement
or
any
lack
of
self-control
,
as
*NL*
by
a
lack
of
dignity
towards
one
's
inferiors
.
She
would
have
regarded
*NL*
the
slightest
symptom
of
sensibility
as
a
kind
of
moral
drunkenness
*NL*
which
puts
one
to
the
blush
and
was
extremely
prejudicial
to
what
a
*NL*
person
of
high
rank
owed
to
herself
.
Her
great
happiness
was
to
talk
of
*NL*
the
king
's
last
hunt
;
her
favourite
book
,
was
the
Memoirs
of
the
Duke
*NL*
de
Saint
Simon
,
especially
the
genealogical
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
knew
the
place
where
the
arrangement
of
the
light
suited
madame
*NL*
de
Fervaques
'
particular
style
of
beauty
.
He
got
there
in
advance
,
but
*NL*
was
careful
to
turn
his
chair
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
see
Mathilde
.
*NL*
*NL*
Astonished
one
day
at
this
consistent
policy
of
hiding
himself
from
*NL*
her
,
she
left
the
blue
sofa
and
came
to
work
by
the
little
table
near
*NL*
the
marechale
's
armchair
.
Julien
had
a
fairly
close
view
of
her
over
*NL*
madame
de
Fervaques
'
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
eyes
,
which
were
the
arbiters
of
his
fate
,
frightened
him
,
and
*NL*
then
hurled
him
violently
out
of
his
habitual
apathy
.
He
talked
,
and
*NL*
talked
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
speaking
to
the
marechale
,
but
his
one
aim
was
to
produce
an
*NL*
impression
upon
Mathilde
's
soul
.
He
became
so
animated
that
eventually
*NL*
madame
de
Fervaques
did
not
manage
to
understand
a
word
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
prime
merit
.
If
it
had
occurred
to
Julien
to
follow
it
up
by
*NL*
some
phrases
of
German
mysticism
,
lofty
religion
,
and
Jesuitism
,
the
*NL*
marechale
would
have
immediately
given
him
a
rank
among
the
superior
*NL*
men
whose
mission
it
was
to
regenerate
the
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
he
has
bad
enough
taste
,
''
said
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
``
to
talk
*NL*
so
long
and
so
ardently
to
madame
de
Fervaques
,
I
shall
not
listen
to
*NL*
him
any
more
.
''
She
kept
her
resolution
during
the
whole
latter
part
of
*NL*
the
evening
,
although
she
had
difficulty
in
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
midnight
,
when
she
took
her
mother
's
candle
to
accompany
her
to
*NL*
her
room
,
madame
de
la
Mole
stopped
on
the
staircase
to
enter
into
an
*NL*
exhaustive
eulogy
of
Julien
.
Mathilde
ended
by
losing
her
temper
.
She
*NL*
could
not
get
to
sleep
.
She
felt
calmed
by
this
thought
:
``
the
very
*NL*
things
which
I
despise
in
a
man
may
none
the
less
constitute
a
great
*NL*
merit
in
the
eyes
of
the
marechale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Julien
,
he
had
done
something
,
he
was
less
unhappy
;
his
eyes
*NL*
chanced
to
fall
on
the
Russian
leather
portfolio
in
which
prince
*NL*
Korasoff
had
placed
the
fifty-three
love
letters
which
he
had
presented
*NL*
to
him
.
Julien
saw
a
note
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
letter
:
No.
1
is
*NL*
sent
eight
days
after
the
first
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
behind
hand
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
.
``
It
is
quite
a
long
time
since
I
*NL*
met
madame
de
Fervaques
.
''
He
immediately
began
to
copy
out
this
first
*NL*
love
letter
.
It
was
a
homily
packed
with
moral
platitudes
and
deadly
*NL*
dull
.
Julien
was
fortunate
enough
to
fall
asleep
at
the
second
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
hours
afterwards
he
was
surprised
to
see
the
broad
daylight
as
he
*NL*
lent
on
his
desk
.
The
most
painful
moments
in
his
life
were
those
when
*NL*
he
woke
up
every
morning
to
realise
his
unhappiness
.
On
this
particular
*NL*
day
he
finished
copying
out
his
letter
in
a
state
verging
on
laughter
.
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
that
there
ever
lived
a
young
*NL*
man
who
actually
wrote
like
that
.
''
He
counted
several
sentences
of
nine
*NL*
lines
each
.
At
the
bottom
of
the
original
he
noticed
a
pencilled
note
.
*NL*
``
These
letters
are
delivered
personally
,
on
horseback
,
black
cravat
,
*NL*
blue
tail-coat
.
You
give
the
letter
to
the
porter
with
a
contrite
air
;
*NL*
expression
of
profound
melancholy
.
If
you
notice
any
chambermaid
,
dry
*NL*
your
eyes
furtively
and
speak
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
duly
carried
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
taking
a
very
bold
course
!
''
thought
Julien
as
he
came
out
of
the
*NL*
Hotel
de
Fervaques
,
``
but
all
the
worse
for
Korasoff
.
To
think
of
daring
*NL*
to
write
to
so
virtuous
a
celebrity
.
I
shall
be
treated
with
the
utmost
*NL*
contempt
,
and
nothing
will
amuse
me
more
.
It
is
really
the
only
comedy
*NL*
that
I
can
in
any
way
appreciate
.
Yes
,
it
will
amuse
me
to
load
with
*NL*
ridicule
that
odious
creature
whom
I
call
myself
.
If
I
believed
in
*NL*
myself
,
I
would
commit
some
crime
to
distract
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
when
Julien
brought
his
horse
back
to
the
stable
was
the
*NL*
happiest
he
had
experienced
for
a
whole
month
.
Korasoff
had
expressly
*NL*
forbidden
him
to
look
at
the
mistress
who
had
left
him
,
on
any
pretext
*NL*
whatsoever
.
But
the
step
of
that
horse
,
which
she
knew
so
well
,
and
*NL*
Julien
's
way
of
knocking
on
the
stable
door
with
his
riding-whip
to
*NL*
call
a
man
,
sometimes
attracted
Mathilde
to
behind
the
window-curtain
.
*NL*
The
muslin
was
so
light
that
Julien
could
see
through
it
.
By
looking
*NL*
under
the
brim
of
his
hat
in
a
certain
way
,
he
could
get
a
view
of
*NL*
Mathilde
's
figure
without
seeing
her
eyes
.
``
Consequently
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
she
can
not
see
mine
,
and
that
is
not
really
looking
at
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
madame
de
Fervaques
behaved
towards
him
,
exactly
as
*NL*
though
she
had
never
received
the
philosophic
mystical
and
religious
*NL*
dissertation
which
he
had
given
to
her
porter
in
the
morning
with
so
*NL*
melancholy
an
air
.
Chance
had
shown
Julien
on
the
preceding
day
how
*NL*
to
be
eloquent
;
he
placed
himself
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
*NL*
see
Mathilde
's
eyes
.
She
,
on
her
side
,
left
the
blue
sofa
a
minute
*NL*
after
the
marechale
's
arrival
;
this
involved
abandoning
her
usual
*NL*
associates
.
M.
de
Croisenois
seemed
overwhelmed
by
this
new
caprice
:
*NL*
his
palpable
grief
alleviated
the
awfulness
of
Julien
's
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unexpected
turn
in
his
life
made
him
talk
like
an
angel
,
and
*NL*
inasmuch
as
a
certain
element
of
self-appreciation
will
insinuate
*NL*
itself
even
into
those
hearts
which
serve
as
a
temple
for
the
*NL*
most
august
virtue
,
the
marechale
said
to
herself
as
she
got
into
*NL*
her
carriage
,
``
Madame
de
la
Mole
is
right
,
this
young
priest
has
*NL*
distinction
.
My
presence
must
have
overawed
him
at
first
.
As
a
matter
*NL*
of
fact
,
the
whole
tone
of
this
house
is
very
frivolous
;
I
can
see
*NL*
nothing
but
instances
of
virtue
helped
by
oldness
,
and
standing
in
*NL*
great
need
of
the
chills
of
age
.
This
young
man
must
have
managed
to
*NL*
appreciate
the
difference
;
he
writes
well
,
but
I
fear
very
much
that
*NL*
this
request
of
his
in
his
letter
for
me
to
enlighten
him
with
my
*NL*
advice
,
is
really
nothing
less
than
an
,
as
yet
,
unconscious
sentiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
how
many
conversions
have
begun
like
that
!
What
makes
me
*NL*
consider
this
a
good
omen
is
the
difference
between
his
style
and
that
*NL*
of
the
young
people
whose
letters
I
have
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
.
*NL*
One
can
not
avoid
recognising
unction
,
profound
seriousness
,
and
much
*NL*
conviction
in
the
prose
of
this
young
acolyte
;
he
has
no
doubt
the
*NL*
sweet
virtue
of
a
Massillon
.

THE
FINEST
PLACES
IN

*NL*
Services
!
talents

merits
!
bah
!
belong
to

coterie
.
*NL*
_
Telemaque
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
a
bishopric
had
thus
become
associated
with
the
idea
of
*NL*
Julien
in
the
mind
of
a
woman
,
who
would
sooner
or
later
have
at
her
*NL*
disposal
the
finest
places
in
the
Church
of
France
.
This
idea
had
not
*NL*
struck
Julien
at
all
;
at
the
present
time
his
thoughts
were
strictly
*NL*
limited
to
his
actual
unhappiness
.
Everything
tended
to
intensify
*NL*
it
.
The
sight
of
his
room
,
for
instance
,
had
become
unbearable
.
When
*NL*
he
came
back
in
the
evening
with
his
candle
,
each
piece
of
furniture
*NL*
and
each
little
ornament
seemed
to
become
articulate
,
and
to
announce
*NL*
harshly
some
new
phase
of
his
unhappiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
hard
task
before
me
today
,
''
he
said
to
himself
as
he
came
in
*NL*
with
a
vivacity
which
he
had
not
experienced
for
a
long
time
;
``
let
us
*NL*
hope
that
the
second
letter
will
be
as
boring
as
the
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
more
so
.
What
he
was
copying
seemed
so
absurd
that
he
finished
*NL*
up
by
transcribing
it
line
for
line
without
thinking
of
the
sense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
even
more
bombastic
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
than
those
official
*NL*
documents
of
the
treaty
of
Munster
which
my
professor
of
diplomacy
made
*NL*
me
copy
out
at
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
then
that
he
remembered
madame
de
Fervaque
's
letters
which
*NL*
he
had
forgotten
to
give
back
to
the
grave
Spaniard
Don
Diego
Bustos
.
*NL*
He
found
them
.
They
were
really
almost
as
nonsensical
as
those
of
*NL*
the
young
Russian
nobleman
.
Their
vagueness
was
unlimited
.
It
meant
*NL*
everything
and
nothing
.
``
It
's
the
AEolian
harp
of
style
,
''
thought
*NL*
Julien
.
``
The
only
real
thing
I
see
in
the
middle
of
all
these
lofty
*NL*
thoughts
about
annihilation
,
death
,
infinity
,
etc.
,
is
an
abominable
*NL*
fear
of
ridicule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
monologue
which
we
have
just
condensed
was
repeated
for
fifteen
*NL*
days
on
end
.
Falling
off
to
sleep
as
he
copied
out
a
sort
of
commentary
*NL*
on
the
Apocalypse
,
going
with
a
melancholy
expression
to
deliver
it
*NL*
the
following
day
,
taking
his
horse
back
to
the
stable
in
the
hope
*NL*
of
catching
sight
of
Mathilde
's
dress
,
working
,
going
in
the
evening
*NL*
to
the
opera
on
those
evenings
when
madame
de
Fervaques
did
not
come
*NL*
to
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
,
such
were
the
monotonous
events
in
Julien
's
*NL*
life
.
His
life
had
more
interest
,
when
madame
la
Fervaques
visited
the
*NL*
marquise
;
he
could
then
catch
a
glimpse
of
Mathilde
's
eyes
underneath
*NL*
a
feather
of
the
marechale
's
hat
,
and
he
would
wax
eloquent
.
His
*NL*
picturesque
and
sentimental
phrases
began
to
assume
a
style
,
which
was
*NL*
both
more
striking
and
more
elegant
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
quite
realised
that
what
he
said
was
absurd
in
Mathilde
's
eyes
,
but
*NL*
he
wished
to
impress
her
by
the
elegance
of
his
diction
.
``
The
falser
my
*NL*
speeches
are
the
more
I
ought
to
please
,
''
thought
Julien
,
and
he
then
*NL*
had
the
abominable
audacity
to
exaggerate
certain
elements
in
his
own
*NL*
character
.
He
soon
appreciated
that
to
avoid
appearing
vulgar
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
marechale
it
was
necessary
to
eschew
simple
and
rational
*NL*
ideas
.
He
would
continue
on
these
lines
,
or
would
cut
short
his
grand
*NL*
eloquence
according
as
he
saw
appreciation
or
indifference
in
the
eyes
*NL*
of
the
two
great
ladies
whom
he
had
set
out
to
please
.
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
it
all
round
,
his
life
was
less
awful
than
when
his
days
were
*NL*
passed
in
inaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
he
said
to
himself
one
evening
,
``
here
I
am
copying
out
the
*NL*
fifteenth
of
these
abominable
dissertations
;
the
first
fourteen
have
*NL*
been
duly
delivered
to
the
marechale
's
porter
.
I
shall
have
the
honour
*NL*
of
filling
all
the
drawers
in
her
escritoire
.
And
yet
she
treats
me
*NL*
as
though
I
never
wrote
.
What
can
be
the
end
of
all
this
?
Will
my
*NL*
constancy
bore
her
as
much
as
it
does
me
?
I
must
admit
that
that
*NL*
Russian
friend
of
Korasoff
's
who
was
in
love
with
the
pretty
Quakeress
*NL*
of
Richmond
,
was
a
terrible
man
in
his
time
;
no
one
could
be
more
*NL*
overwhelming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Like
all
mediocre
individuals
,
who
chance
to
come
into
contact
with
the
*NL*
manoeuvres
of
a
great
general
,
Julien
understood
nothing
of
the
attack
*NL*
executed
by
the
young
Russian
on
the
heart
of
the
young
English
girl
.
*NL*
The
only
purpose
of
the
first
forty
letters
was
to
secure
forgiveness
*NL*
for
the
boldness
of
writing
at
all
.
The
sweet
person
,
who
perhaps
lived
*NL*
a
life
of
inordinate
boredom
,
had
to
be
induced
to
contract
the
habit
*NL*
of
receiving
letters
,
which
were
perhaps
a
little
less
insipid
than
her
*NL*
everyday
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
a
letter
was
delivered
to
Julien
.
He
recognised
the
arms
*NL*
of
madame
la
Fervaques
,
and
broke
the
seal
with
an
eagerness
which
*NL*
would
have
seemed
impossible
to
him
some
days
before
.
It
was
only
an
*NL*
invitation
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rushed
to
prince
Korasoffs
instructions
.
Unfortunately
the
young
*NL*
Russian
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
be
as
flippant
as
Dorat
,
just
*NL*
when
he
should
have
been
simple
and
intelligible
!
Julien
was
not
able
*NL*
to
form
any
idea
of
the
moral
position
which
he
ought
to
take
up
at
the
*NL*
marechale
's
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
salon
was
extremely
magnificent
and
decorated
like
the
gallery
de
*NL*
Diane
in
the
Tuileries
with
panelled
oil-paintings
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
light
spots
on
these
pictures
.
Julien
learnt
later
that
*NL*
the
mistress
of
the
house
had
thought
the
subject
somewhat
lacking
in
*NL*
decency
and
that
she
had
had
the
pictures
corrected
.
``
What
a
moral
*NL*
century
!
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
noticed
in
this
salon
three
of
the
persons
who
had
been
present
*NL*
at
the
drawing
up
of
the
secret
note
.
One
of
them
,
my
lord
bishop
of
*NL*
--
the
marechale
's
uncle
had
the
disposition
of
the
ecclesiastical
*NL*
patronage
,
and
could
,
it
was
said
,
refuse
his
niece
nothing
.
``
What
*NL*
immense
progress
I
have
made
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
with
a
melancholy
*NL*
smile
,
``
and
how
indifferent
I
am
to
it
.
Here
I
am
dining
with
the
*NL*
famous
bishop
of
--
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
mediocre
and
the
conversation
wearisome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
like
the
small
talk
in
a
bad
book
,
''
thought
Julien
.
``
All
the
*NL*
greatest
subjects
of
human
thought
are
proudly
tackled
.
After
listening
*NL*
for
three
minutes
one
asks
oneself
which
is
greater
--
the
speaker
's
*NL*
bombast
,
or
his
abominable
ignorance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
doubtless
forgotten
the
little
man
of
letters
named
*NL*
Tanbeau
,
who
was
the
nephew
of
the
Academician
,
and
intended
to
be
*NL*
professor
,
who
seemed
entrusted
with
the
task
of
poisoning
the
salon
of
*NL*
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
with
his
base
calumnies
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
little
man
who
gave
Julien
the
first
inkling
that
though
,
*NL*
madame
de
Fervaques
did
not
answer
,
she
might
quite
well
take
an
*NL*
indulgent
view
of
the
sentiment
which
dictated
them
.
M.
Tanbeau
's
*NL*
sinister
soul
was
lacerated
by
the
thought
of
Julien
's
success
;
``
but
*NL*
since
,
on
the
other
hand
,
a
man
of
merit
can
not
be
in
two
places
at
the
*NL*
same
time
any
more
than
a
fool
,
''
said
the
future
professor
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
if
Sorel
becomes
the
lover
of
the
sublime
marechale
,
she
will
obtain
*NL*
some
lucrative
position
for
him
in
the
church
,
and
I
shall
be
rid
of
*NL*
him
in
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
the
abbe
Pirard
addressed
long
sermons
to
Julien
concerning
his
*NL*
success
at
the
hotel
de
Fervaques
.
There
was
a
sectarian
jealousy
*NL*
between
the
austere
Jansenist
and
the
salon
of
the
virtuous
marechale
*NL*
which
was
Jesuitical
,
reactionary
,
and
monarchical
.

CHAPTER
LVIII
*NL*
*NL*
MANON
LESCAUT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
once
he
was
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
*NL*
asinine
stupidity
of
the
prior
,
he
would
usually
succeed
*NL*
well
enough
by
calling
white
black
,
and
black
white
.
*NL*
_
Lichtenberg
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russian
instructions
peremptorily
forbade
the
writer
from
ever
*NL*
contradicting
in
conversation
the
recipient
of
the
letters
.
No
pretext
*NL*
could
excuse
any
deviation
from
the
role
of
that
most
ecstatic
*NL*
admiration
.
The
letters
were
always
based
on
that
hypothesis
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
at
the
opera
,
when
in
madame
de
Fervaques
'
box
,
Julien
*NL*
spoke
of
the
ballet
of
_
Manon
Lescaut
_
in
the
most
enthusiastic
terms
.
*NL*
His
only
reason
for
talking
in
that
strain
was
the
fact
that
he
thought
*NL*
it
insignificant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marechale
said
that
the
ballet
was
very
inferior
to
the
abbe
*NL*
Prevost
's
novel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
idea
,
''
thought
Julien
,
both
surprised
and
amused
,
``
of
so
highly
*NL*
virtuous
a
person
praising
a
novel
!
Madame
de
Fervaques
used
to
profess
*NL*
two
or
three
times
a
week
the
most
absolute
contempt
for
those
writers
,
*NL*
who
,
by
means
of
their
insipid
works
,
try
to
corrupt
a
youth
which
is
,
*NL*
alas
!
only
too
inclined
to
the
errors
of
the
senses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Manon
Lescaut
_
''
continued
the
marechale
,
``
is
said
to
be
one
of
the
*NL*
best
of
this
immoral
and
dangerous
type
of
book
.
The
weaknesses
and
the
*NL*
deserved
anguish
of
a
criminal
heart
are
,
they
say
,
portrayed
with
a
*NL*
truth
which
is
not
lacking
in
depth
;
a
fact
which
does
not
prevent
your
*NL*
Bonaparte
from
stating
at
St.
Helena
that
it
is
simply
a
novel
written
*NL*
for
lackeys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
Bonaparte
restored
to
Julien
all
the
activity
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
``
They
have
tried
to
ruin
me
with
the
marechale
;
they
have
told
her
of
*NL*
my
enthusiasm
for
Napoleon
.
This
fact
has
sufficiently
piqued
her
to
*NL*
make
her
yield
to
the
temptation
to
make
me
feel
it
.
''
This
discovery
*NL*
amused
him
all
the
evening
,
and
rendered
him
amusing
.
As
he
took
leave
*NL*
of
the
marechale
in
the
vestibule
of
the
opera
,
she
said
to
him
,
*NL*
``
Remember
,
monsieur
,
one
must
not
like
Bonaparte
if
you
like
me
;
at
*NL*
the
best
he
can
only
be
accepted
as
a
necessity
imposed
by
Providence
.
*NL*
Besides
,
the
man
did
not
have
a
sufficiently
supple
soul
to
appreciate
*NL*
masterpieces
of
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
like
me
,
''
Julien
kept
on
repeating
to
himself
,
``
that
means
*NL*
nothing
or
means
everything
.
Here
we
have
mysteries
of
language
which
*NL*
are
beyond
us
poor
provincials
.
''
And
he
thought
a
great
deal
about
*NL*
madame
de
Renal
,
as
he
copied
out
an
immense
letter
destined
for
the
*NL*
marechale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
,
''
she
said
to
him
the
following
day
,
with
an
assumed
*NL*
indifference
which
he
thought
was
clumsily
assumed
,
``
that
you
talk
to
*NL*
me
about
London
and
Richmond
in
a
letter
which
you
wrote
last
night
,
I
*NL*
think
,
when
you
came
back
from
the
opera
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
very
embarrassed
.
He
had
copied
line
by
line
without
*NL*
thinking
about
what
he
was
writing
,
and
had
apparently
forgotten
to
*NL*
substitute
Paris
and
Saint
Cloud
for
the
words
London
and
Richmond
*NL*
which
occurred
in
the
original
.
He
commenced
two
or
three
sentences
,
*NL*
but
found
it
impossible
to
finish
them
.
He
felt
on
the
point
of
*NL*
succumbing
to
a
fit
of
idiotic
laughter
.
Finally
by
picking
his
words
*NL*
he
succeeded
in
formulating
this
inspiration
:
``
Exalted
as
I
was
by
the
*NL*
discussion
of
the
most
sublime
and
greatest
interests
of
the
human
*NL*
soul
,
my
own
soul
may
have
been
somewhat
absent
in
my
letter
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
making
an
impression
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
so
I
can
spare
myself
*NL*
the
boredom
of
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
''
He
left
the
Hotel
de
Fervaques
*NL*
at
a
run
.
In
the
evening
he
had
another
look
at
the
original
of
the
*NL*
letter
which
he
had
copied
out
on
the
previous
night
,
and
soon
came
to
*NL*
the
fatal
place
where
the
young
Russian
made
mention
of
London
and
of
*NL*
Richmond
.
Julien
was
very
astonished
to
find
this
letter
almost
tender
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
the
contrast
between
the
apparent
lightness
of
his
*NL*
conversation
,
and
the
sublime
and
almost
apocalyptic
profundity
of
*NL*
his
letters
which
had
marked
him
out
for
favour
.
The
marechale
was
*NL*
particularly
pleased
by
the
longness
of
the
sentences
;
this
was
very
*NL*
far
from
being
that
sprightly
style
which
that
immoral
man
Voltaire
*NL*
had
brought
into
fashion
.
Although
our
hero
made
every
possible
human
*NL*
effort
to
eliminate
from
his
conversation
any
symptom
of
good
sense
,
it
*NL*
still
preserved
a
certain
anti-monarchical
and
blasphemous
tinge
which
*NL*
did
not
escape
madame
de
Fervaques
.
Surrounded
as
she
was
by
persons
*NL*
who
,
though
eminently
moral
,
had
very
often
not
a
single
idea
during
a
*NL*
whole
evening
,
this
lady
was
profoundly
struck
by
anything
resembling
*NL*
a
novelty
,
but
at
the
same
time
she
thought
she
owed
it
to
herself
to
*NL*
be
offended
by
it
.
She
called
this
defect
:
Keeping
the
imprint
of
the
*NL*
lightness
of
the
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
such
salons
are
only
worth
observing
when
one
has
a
favour
to
*NL*
procure
.
The
reader
doubtless
shares
all
the
ennui
of
the
colourless
*NL*
life
which
Julien
was
leading
.
This
period
represents
the
steppes
of
*NL*
our
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
needed
to
exercise
her
self-control
to
avoid
*NL*
thinking
of
Julien
during
the
whole
period
filled
by
the
de
Fervaques
*NL*
episode
.
Her
soul
was
a
prey
to
violent
battles
;
sometimes
she
piqued
*NL*
herself
on
despising
that
melancholy
young
man
,
but
his
conversation
*NL*
captivated
her
in
spite
of
herself
.
She
was
particularly
astonished
by
*NL*
his
absolute
falseness
.
He
did
not
say
a
single
word
to
the
marechale
*NL*
which
was
not
a
lie
,
or
at
any
rate
,
an
abominable
travesty
of
his
own
*NL*
way
of
thinking
,
which
Mathilde
knew
so
perfectly
in
every
phase
.
This
*NL*
Machiavellianism
impressed
her
.
``
What
subtlety
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
*NL*
``
What
a
difference
between
the
bombastic
coxcombs
,
or
the
common
*NL*
rascals
like
Tanbeau
who
talk
in
the
same
strain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
Julien
went
through
awful
days
.
It
was
only
to
accomplish
*NL*
the
most
painful
of
duties
that
he
put
in
a
daily
appearance
in
the
*NL*
marechale
's
salon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strain
of
playing
a
part
ended
by
depriving
his
mind
of
all
its
*NL*
strength
.
As
he
crossed
each
night
the
immense
courtyard
of
the
Hotel
*NL*
de
Fervaques
,
it
was
only
through
sheer
force
in
character
and
logic
*NL*
that
he
succeeded
in
keeping
a
little
above
the
level
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
overcame
despair
at
the
seminary
,
''
he
said
,
``
yet
what
an
awful
*NL*
prospect
I
had
then
.
I
was
then
either
going
to
make
my
fortune
or
*NL*
come
to
grief
just
as
I
am
now
.
I
found
myself
obliged
to
pass
all
my
*NL*
life
in
intimate
association
with
the
most
contemptible
and
disgusting
*NL*
things
in
the
whole
world
.
The
following
spring
,
just
eleven
short
*NL*
months
later
,
I
was
perhaps
the
happiest
of
all
young
people
of
my
own
*NL*
age
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
very
often
all
this
fine
logic
proved
unavailing
against
the
awful
*NL*
reality
.
He
saw
Mathilde
every
day
at
breakfast
and
at
dinner
.
He
knew
*NL*
from
the
numerous
letters
which
de
la
Mole
dictated
to
him
that
she
was
*NL*
on
the
eve
of
marrying
de
Croisenois
.
This
charming
man
already
called
*NL*
twice
a
day
at
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
;
the
jealous
eye
of
a
jilted
lover
*NL*
was
alive
to
every
one
of
his
movements
.
When
he
thought
he
had
noticed
*NL*
that
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
was
beginning
to
encourage
her
intended
,
*NL*
Julien
could
not
help
looking
tenderly
at
his
pistols
as
he
went
up
to
*NL*
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
would
it
not
be
much
wiser
to
take
the
marks
*NL*
out
of
my
linen
and
to
go
into
some
solitary
forest
twenty
leagues
from
*NL*
Paris
to
put
an
end
to
this
atrocious
life
?
I
should
be
unknown
in
the
*NL*
district
,
my
death
would
remain
a
secret
for
a
fortnight
,
and
who
would
*NL*
bother
about
me
after
a
fortnight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
reasoning
was
very
logical
.
But
on
the
following
day
a
glimpse
of
*NL*
Mathilde
's
arm
between
the
sleeve
of
her
dress
and
her
glove
sufficed
*NL*
to
plunge
our
young
philosopher
into
memories
which
,
though
agonising
,
*NL*
none
the
less
gave
him
a
hold
on
life
.
``
Well
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
*NL*
will
follow
this
Russian
plan
to
the
end
.
How
will
it
all
finish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
as
the
marechale
is
concerned
,
after
I
have
copied
out
these
*NL*
fifty-three
letters
,
I
shall
not
write
any
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
Mathilde
,
these
six
weeks
of
painful
acting
will
either
leave
*NL*
her
anger
unchanged
,
or
will
win
me
a
moment
of
reconciliation
.
Great
*NL*
God
!
I
should
die
of
happiness
.
''
And
he
could
not
finish
his
train
of
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
long
reverie
he
succeeded
in
taking
up
the
thread
of
his
*NL*
argument
.
``
In
that
case
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
should
win
one
day
of
*NL*
happiness
,
and
after
that
her
cruelties
which
are
based
,
alas
,
on
my
*NL*
lack
of
ability
to
please
her
will
recommence
.
I
should
have
nothing
*NL*
left
to
do
,
I
should
be
ruined
and
lost
for
ever
.
With
such
a
character
*NL*
as
hers
what
guarantee
can
she
give
me
?
Alas
!
My
manners
are
no
doubt
*NL*
lacking
in
elegance
,
and
my
style
of
speech
is
heavy
and
monotonous

Great
God

why
am
I
myself

Sacrificing

let
it
pass
;
*NL*
but

to
passions

Oh

melancholy

*NL*
_
Girodet

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Fervaques
had
begun
reading
Julien
's
long
letters
without
any
*NL*
pleasure
,
but
she
now
began
to
think
about
them
;
one
thing
,
however
,
*NL*
grieved
her
.
``
What
a
pity
that
M.
Sorel
was
not
a
real
priest
!
He
could
*NL*
then
be
admitted
to
a
kind
of
intimacy
;
but
in
view
of
that
cross
,
*NL*
and
that
almost
lay
dress
,
one
is
exposed
to
cruel
questions
and
what
*NL*
is
one
to
answer
?
''
She
did
not
finish
the
train
of
thought
,
``
Some
*NL*
malicious
woman
friend
may
think
,
and
even
spread
it
about
that
he
is
*NL*
some
lower
middle-class
cousin
or
other
,
a
relative
of
my
father
,
some
*NL*
tradesman
who
has
been
decorated
by
the
National
Guard
.
''
Up
to
the
*NL*
time
which
she
had
seen
Julien
,
madame
de
Fervaque
's
greatest
pleasure
*NL*
had
been
writing
the
word
marechale
after
her
name
.
Consequently
a
*NL*
morbid
parvenu
vanity
,
which
was
ready
to
take
umbrage
at
everything
,
*NL*
combatted
the
awakening
of
her
interest
in
him
.
``
It
would
be
so
easy
*NL*
for
me
,
''
said
the
marechale
,
``
to
make
him
a
grand
vicar
in
some
diocese
*NL*
near
Paris
!
but
plain
M.
Sorel
,
and
what
is
more
,
a
man
who
is
the
*NL*
secretary
of
M.
de
la
Mole
!
It
is
heart-breaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
this
soul
,
which
was
afraid
of
*NL*
everything
,
was
moved
by
an
interest
which
was
alien
to
its
own
*NL*
pretensions
to
rank
and
superiority
.
Her
old
porter
noticed
that
*NL*
whenever
he
brought
a
letter
from
this
handsome
young
man
,
who
always
*NL*
looked
so
sad
,
he
was
certain
to
see
that
absent
,
discontented
*NL*
expression
,
which
the
marechale
always
made
a
point
of
assuming
on
the
*NL*
entry
of
any
of
her
servants
,
immediately
disappear
.
The
boredom
of
a
*NL*
mode
of
life
whose
ambitions
were
concentrated
on
impressing
the
public
*NL*
without
her
having
at
heart
any
real
faculty
of
enjoyment
for
that
kind
*NL*
of
success
,
had
become
so
intolerable
since
she
had
begun
to
think
of
*NL*
Julien
that
,
all
that
was
necessary
to
prevent
her
chambermaids
being
*NL*
bullied
for
a
whole
day
,
was
that
their
mistress
should
have
passed
*NL*
an
hour
in
the
society
of
this
strange
young
man
on
the
evening
of
*NL*
the
preceding
day
.
His
budding
credit
was
proof
against
very
cleverly
*NL*
written
anonymous
letters
.
It
was
in
vain
that
Tanbeau
supplied
M.
de
*NL*
Luz
,
de
Croisenois
,
de
Caylus
,
with
two
or
three
very
clever
calumnies
*NL*
which
these
gentlemen
were
only
too
glad
to
spread
,
without
making
*NL*
too
many
enquiries
of
the
actual
truth
of
the
charges
.
The
marechale
,
*NL*
whose
temperament
was
not
calculated
to
be
proof
against
these
vulgar
*NL*
expedients
related
her
doubts
to
Mathilde
,
and
was
always
consoled
by
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
madame
de
Fervaques
,
after
having
asked
three
times
if
there
*NL*
were
any
letters
for
her
,
suddenly
decided
to
answer
Julien
.
It
was
a
*NL*
case
of
the
triumph
of
ennui
.
On
reaching
the
second
letter
in
his
name
*NL*
the
marechale
almost
felt
herself
pulled
up
sharp
by
the
unbecomingness
*NL*
of
writing
with
her
own
hand
so
vulgar
an
address
as
to
M.
Sorel
,
care
*NL*
of
M.
le
Marquis
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
bring
me
envelopes
with
your
address
on
,
''
she
said
very
drily
*NL*
to
Julien
in
the
evening
.
``
Here
I
am
appointed
lover
and
valet
in
one
,
''
*NL*
thought
Julien
,
and
he
bowed
,
amused
himself
by
wrinkling
his
face
up
*NL*
like
Arsene
,
the
old
valet
of
the
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
brought
the
envelopes
that
very
evening
,
and
he
received
the
third
*NL*
letter
very
early
on
the
following
day
:
he
read
five
or
six
lines
at
*NL*
the
beginning
,
and
two
or
three
towards
the
end
.
There
were
four
pages
*NL*
of
a
small
and
very
close
writing
.
The
lady
gradually
developed
the
*NL*
sweet
habit
of
writing
nearly
every
day
.
Julien
answered
by
faithful
*NL*
copies
of
the
Russian
letters
;
and
such
is
the
advantage
of
the
*NL*
bombastic
style
that
madame
de
Fervaques
was
not
a
bit
astonished
by
*NL*
the
lack
of
connection
between
his
answers
and
her
letters
.
How
gravely
*NL*
irritated
would
her
pride
have
been
if
the
little
Tanbeau
who
had
*NL*
constituted
himself
a
voluntary
spy
on
all
Julien
's
movements
had
been
*NL*
able
to
have
informed
her
that
all
these
letters
were
left
unsealed
and
*NL*
thrown
haphazard
into
Julien
's
drawer
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
the
porter
was
bringing
into
the
library
a
letter
to
him
*NL*
from
the
marechale
.
Mathilde
met
the
man
,
saw
the
letter
together
with
*NL*
the
address
in
Julien
's
handwriting
.
She
entered
the
library
as
the
*NL*
porter
was
leaving
it
,
the
letter
was
still
on
the
edge
of
the
table
.
*NL*
Julien
was
very
busy
with
his
work
and
had
not
yet
put
it
in
his
drawer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
endure
this
,
''
exclaimed
Mathilde
,
as
she
took
possession
*NL*
of
the
letter
,
``
you
are
completely
forgetting
me
,
me
your
wife
,
your
*NL*
conduct
is
awful
,
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
her
pride
,
shocked
by
the
awful
unseemliness
of
her
*NL*
proceeding
,
prevented
her
from
speaking
.
She
burst
into
tears
,
and
soon
*NL*
seemed
to
Julien
scarcely
able
to
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
so
surprised
and
embarrassed
that
he
did
not
fully
*NL*
appreciate
how
ideally
fortunate
this
scene
was
for
himself
.
He
helped
*NL*
Mathilde
to
sit
down
;
she
almost
abandoned
herself
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
minute
in
which
he
noticed
this
movement
,
he
felt
an
extreme
*NL*
joy
.
Immediately
afterwards
,
he
thought
of
Korasoff
:
``
I
may
lose
*NL*
everything
by
a
single
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
strain
of
carrying
out
his
tactics
was
so
great
that
his
arms
*NL*
stiffened
.
``
I
dare
not
even
allow
myself
to
press
this
supple
,
charming
*NL*
frame
to
my
heart
,
or
she
will
despise
me
or
treat
me
badly
.
What
an
*NL*
awful
character
!
''
And
while
he
cursed
Mathilde
's
character
,
he
loved
*NL*
her
a
hundred
times
more
.
He
thought
he
had
a
queen
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
impassive
coldness
intensified
the
anguished
pride
which
was
*NL*
lacerating
the
soul
of
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
She
was
far
from
having
*NL*
the
necessary
self-possession
to
try
and
read
in
his
eyes
what
he
felt
*NL*
for
her
at
that
particular
moment
.
She
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
*NL*
look
at
him
.
She
trembled
lest
she
might
encounter
a
contemptuous
*NL*
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seated
motionless
on
the
library
divan
,
with
her
head
turned
in
the
*NL*
opposite
direction
to
Julien
,
she
was
a
prey
to
the
most
poignant
*NL*
anguish
that
pride
and
love
can
inflict
upon
a
human
soul
.
What
an
*NL*
awful
step
had
she
just
slipped
into
taking
!
``
It
has
been
reserved
*NL*
for
me
,
unhappy
woman
that
I
am
,
to
see
my
most
unbecoming
advances
*NL*
rebuffed
!
and
rebuffed
by
whom
?
''
added
her
maddened
and
wounded
pride
;
*NL*
``
rebuffed
by
a
servant
of
my
father
's
!
That
's
more
than
I
will
put
up
*NL*
with
,
''
she
said
aloud
,
and
rising
in
a
fury
,
she
opened
the
drawer
of
*NL*
Julien
's
table
,
which
was
two
yards
in
front
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
petrified
with
horror
when
she
saw
eight
or
ten
unopened
*NL*
letters
,
completely
like
the
one
the
porter
had
just
brought
up
.
She
*NL*
recognised
Julien
's
handwriting
,
though
more
or
less
disguised
,
on
all
*NL*
the
addresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
she
cried
,
quite
beside
herself
,
``
you
are
not
only
on
good
terms
*NL*
with
her
,
but
you
actually
despise
her
.
You
,
a
nobody
,
despise
madame
*NL*
la
marechale
de
Fervaques
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
forgive
me
,
my
dear
,
''
she
added
,
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
;
*NL*
``
despise
me
if
you
wish
,
but
love
me
.
I
can
not
live
without
your
love
.
''
*NL*
And
she
fell
down
in
a
dead
faint
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
our
proud
lady
is
lying
at
my
feet
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.

*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
these
great
transports
Julien
felt
more
surprised
than
*NL*
happy
.
Mathilde
's
abuse
proved
to
him
the
shrewdness
of
the
Russian
*NL*
tactics
.
''
`
Few
words
,
few
deeds
,
'
that
is
my
one
method
of
salvation
.
''
*NL*
He
picked
up
Mathilde
,
and
without
saying
a
word
,
put
her
back
on
the
*NL*
divan
.
She
was
gradually
being
overcome
by
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
keep
herself
in
countenance
,
she
took
madame
de
Fervaques
'
*NL*
letters
in
her
hands
,
and
slowly
broke
the
seals
.
She
gave
a
noticeable
*NL*
nervous
movement
when
she
recognised
the
marechale
's
handwriting
.
She
*NL*
turned
over
the
pages
of
these
letters
without
reading
them
.
Most
of
*NL*
them
were
six
pages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
answer
me
,
''
Mathilde
said
at
last
,
in
the
most
supplicatory
*NL*
tone
,
but
without
daring
to
look
at
Julien
:
``
You
know
how
proud
I
am
.
*NL*
It
is
the
misfortune
of
my
position
,
and
of
my
temperament
,
too
,
I
*NL*
confess
.
Has
madame
de
Fervaques
robbed
me
of
your
heart
?
Has
she
made
*NL*
the
sacrifices
to
which
my
fatal
love
swept
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
dismal
silence
was
all
Julien
's
answer
.
``
By
what
right
,
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
``
does
she
ask
me
to
commit
an
indiscretion
unworthy
of
an
honest
man
?
''
*NL*
Mathilde
tried
to
read
the
letters
;
her
eyes
were
so
wet
with
tears
*NL*
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
do
so
.
She
had
been
unhappy
for
a
*NL*
month
past
,
but
this
haughty
soul
had
been
very
far
from
owning
its
own
*NL*
feelings
even
to
itself
.
Chance
alone
had
brought
about
this
explosion
.
*NL*
For
one
instant
jealousy
and
love
had
won
a
victory
over
pride
.
She
*NL*
was
sitting
on
the
divan
,
and
very
near
him
.
He
saw
her
hair
and
her
*NL*
alabaster
neck
.
For
a
moment
he
forgot
all
he
owed
to
himself
.
He
*NL*
passed
his
arm
around
her
waist
,
and
clasped
her
almost
to
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slowly
turned
her
head
towards
him
.
He
was
astonished
by
the
*NL*
extreme
anguish
in
her
eyes
.
There
was
not
a
trace
of
their
usual
*NL*
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
felt
his
strength
desert
him
.
So
great
was
the
deadly
pain
of
*NL*
the
courageous
feat
which
he
was
imposing
on
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
eyes
will
soon
express
nothing
but
the
coldest
disdain
,
''
said
*NL*
Julien
to
himself
,
``
if
I
allow
myself
to
be
swept
away
by
the
happiness
*NL*
of
loving
her
.
''
She
,
however
,
kept
repeatedly
assuring
him
at
this
*NL*
moment
,
in
a
hushed
voice
,
and
in
words
which
she
had
scarcely
the
*NL*
strength
to
finish
,
of
all
her
remorse
for
those
steps
which
her
*NL*
inordinate
pride
had
dictated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
too
,
have
pride
,
''
said
Julien
to
her
,
in
a
scarcely
articulate
*NL*
voice
,
while
his
features
portrayed
the
lowest
depths
of
physical
*NL*
prostration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
turned
round
sharply
towards
him
.
Hearing
his
voice
was
a
*NL*
happiness
which
she
had
given
up
hoping
.
At
this
moment
her
only
*NL*
thought
of
her
haughtiness
was
to
curse
it
.
She
would
have
liked
to
*NL*
have
found
out
some
abnormal
and
incredible
actions
,
in
order
to
prove
*NL*
to
him
the
extent
to
which
she
adored
him
and
detested
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
pride
is
probably
the
reason
,
''
continued
Julien
,
``
why
you
singled
*NL*
me
out
for
a
moment
.
My
present
courageous
and
manly
firmness
is
*NL*
certainly
the
reason
why
you
respect
me
.
I
may
entertain
love
for
the
*NL*
marechale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
shuddered
;
a
strange
expression
came
into
her
eyes
.
She
was
*NL*
going
to
hear
her
sentence
pronounced
.
This
shudder
did
not
escape
*NL*
Julien
.
He
felt
his
courage
weaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
as
he
listened
to
the
sound
of
the
vain
words
*NL*
which
his
mouth
was
articulating
,
as
he
thought
it
were
some
strange
*NL*
sound
,
``
if
I
could
only
cover
those
pale
cheeks
with
kisses
without
*NL*
your
feeling
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
entertain
love
for
the
marechale
,
''
he
continued
,
while
his
voice
*NL*
became
weaker
and
weaker
,
``
but
I
certainly
have
no
definite
proof
of
*NL*
her
interest
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
looked
at
him
.
He
supported
that
look
.
He
hoped
,
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
that
his
expression
had
not
betrayed
him
.
He
felt
himself
bathed
in
a
*NL*
love
that
penetrated
even
into
the
most
secret
recesses
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
He
had
never
adored
her
so
much
;
he
was
almost
as
mad
as
Mathilde
.
If
*NL*
she
had
mustered
sufficient
self-possession
and
courage
to
manoeuvre
,
he
*NL*
would
have
abandoned
all
his
play-acting
,
and
fallen
at
her
feet
.
He
*NL*
had
sufficient
strength
to
manage
to
continue
speaking
:
``
Ah
,
Korasoff
,
''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
mentally
,
``
why
are
you
not
here
?
How
I
need
a
word
from
*NL*
you
to
guide
me
in
my
conduct
.
''
During
this
time
his
voice
was
saying
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
default
of
any
other
sentiment
,
gratitude
would
be
sufficient
to
*NL*
attach
me
to
the
marechale
.
She
has
been
indulgent
to
me
;
she
has
*NL*
consoled
me
when
I
have
been
despised
.
I
can
not
put
unlimited
faith
*NL*
in
certain
appearances
which
are
,
no
doubt
,
extremely
flattering
,
but
*NL*
possibly
very
fleeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
exclaimed
Mathilde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
guarantee
will
you
give
me
?
''
replied
Julien
with
a
sharp
,
*NL*
firm
intonation
,
which
seemed
to
abandon
for
a
moment
the
prudent
forms
*NL*
of
diplomacy
.
``
What
guarantee
,
what
god
will
warrant
that
the
position
*NL*
to
which
you
seem
inclined
to
restore
me
at
the
present
moment
will
*NL*
last
more
than
two
days
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
excess
of
my
love
,
and
my
unhappiness
if
you
do
not
love
me
,
''
she
*NL*
said
to
him
,
taking
his
hands
and
turning
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spasmodic
movement
which
she
had
just
made
had
slightly
displaced
*NL*
her
tippet
;
Julien
caught
a
view
of
her
charming
shoulders
.
Her
*NL*
slightly
dishevelled
hair
recalled
a
delicious
memory
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
on
the
point
of
succumbing
.
``
One
imprudent
word
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
and
I
have
to
start
all
over
again
that
long
series
of
days
*NL*
which
I
have
passed
in
despair
.
Madame
de
Renal
used
to
find
reasons
*NL*
for
doing
what
her
heart
dictated
.
This
young
girl
of
high
society
*NL*
never
allows
her
heart
to
be
moved
except
when
she
has
proved
to
*NL*
herself
by
sound
logic
that
it
ought
to
be
moved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
this
proof
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
and
in
the
twinkling
*NL*
of
an
eye
too
,
he
regained
his
courage
.
He
took
away
his
hands
which
*NL*
Mathilde
was
pressing
in
her
own
,
and
moved
a
little
away
from
her
with
*NL*
a
marked
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Human
courage
could
not
go
further
.
He
then
busied
himself
with
*NL*
putting
together
madame
de
Fervaque
's
letters
which
were
spread
out
on
*NL*
the
divan
,
and
it
was
with
all
the
appearance
of
extreme
politeness
*NL*
that
he
cruelly
exploited
the
psychological
moment
by
adding
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
will
allow
me
to
reflect
over
all
this
.
''
He
*NL*
went
rapidly
away
and
left
the
library
;
she
heard
him
shut
all
the
*NL*
doors
one
after
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
monster
is
not
the
least
bit
troubled
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
But
*NL*
what
am
I
saying
?
Monster
?
He
is
wise
,
prudent
,
good
.
It
is
I
myself
*NL*
who
have
committed
more
wrong
than
one
can
imagine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
point
of
view
lasted
.
Mathilde
was
almost
happy
today
,
for
she
*NL*
gave
herself
up
to
love
unreservedly
.
One
would
have
said
that
this
*NL*
soul
had
never
been
disturbed
by
pride
-LRB-
and
what
pride
!
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
She
shuddered
with
horror
when
a
lackey
announced
madame
le
Fervaques
*NL*
into
the
salon
in
the
evening
.
The
man
's
voice
struck
her
as
sinister
.
*NL*
She
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
the
marechale
,
and
stopped
suddenly
.
*NL*
Julien
who
had
felt
little
pride
over
his
painful
victory
,
had
feared
*NL*
to
face
her
,
and
had
not
dined
at
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
love
and
his
happiness
rapidly
increased
in
proportion
to
the
time
*NL*
that
elapsed
from
the
moment
of
the
battle
.
He
was
blaming
himself
*NL*
already
.
``
How
could
I
resist
her
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Suppose
she
*NL*
were
to
go
and
leave
off
loving
me
!
One
single
moment
may
change
that
*NL*
haughty
soul
,
and
I
must
admit
that
I
have
treated
her
awfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
he
felt
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
put
in
*NL*
an
appearance
at
the
Bouffes
in
madame
de
Fervaques
'
box
.
She
had
*NL*
expressly
invited
him
.
Mathilde
would
be
bound
to
know
of
his
presence
*NL*
or
his
discourteous
absence
.
In
spite
of
the
clearness
of
this
logic
,
*NL*
he
could
not
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
bring
himself
to
plunge
*NL*
into
society
.
By
speaking
he
would
lose
half
his
happiness
.
Ten
o'clock
*NL*
struck
and
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
show
himself
.
Luckily
he
*NL*
found
the
marechale
's
box
packed
with
women
,
and
was
relegated
to
a
*NL*
place
near
the
door
where
he
was
completely
hidden
by
the
hats
.
This
*NL*
position
saved
him
from
looking
ridiculous
;
Caroline
's
divine
notes
of
*NL*
despair
in
the
_
Matrimonio
Segreto
_
made
him
burst
into
tears
.
Madame
*NL*
de
Fervaques
saw
these
tears
.
They
represented
so
great
a
contrast
*NL*
with
the
masculine
firmness
of
his
usual
expression
that
the
soul
*NL*
of
the
old-fashioned
lady
,
saturated
as
it
had
been
for
many
years
*NL*
with
all
the
corroding
acid
of
parvenu
haughtiness
,
was
none
the
less
*NL*
touched
.
Such
remnants
of
a
woman
's
heart
as
she
still
possessed
*NL*
impelled
her
to
speak
:
she
wanted
to
enjoy
the
sound
of
his
voice
at
*NL*
this
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
the
de
la
Mole
ladies
?
''
she
said
to
him
.
``
They
are
*NL*
in
the
third
tier
.
''
Julien
immediately
craned
out
over
the
theatre
,
*NL*
leaning
politely
enough
on
the
front
of
the
box
.
He
saw
Mathilde
;
her
*NL*
eyes
were
shining
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
it
is
not
their
Opera
day
,
''
thought
Julien
;
``
how
eager
she
*NL*
must
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
had
prevailed
on
her
mother
to
come
to
the
Bouffes
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
inconveniently
high
tier
of
the
box
,
which
a
lady
friend
of
the
*NL*
family
had
hastened
to
offer
her
.
She
wanted
to
see
if
Julien
would
*NL*
pass
the
evening
with
the
marechale
.

FRIGHTEN
HER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
this
is
the
fine
miracle
of
your
civilisation
;
you
*NL*
have
turned
love
into
an
ordinary
business
.
--
_
Barnave
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
rushed
into
madame
de
la
Mole
's
box
.
His
eyes
first
met
the
*NL*
tearful
eyes
of
Mathilde
;
she
was
crying
without
reserve
.
There
were
*NL*
only
insignificant
personages
present
,
the
friend
who
had
leant
her
*NL*
box
,
and
some
men
whom
she
knew
.
Mathilde
placed
her
hand
on
Julien
's
;
*NL*
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
fear
of
her
mother
.
Almost
stifled
as
*NL*
she
was
by
her
tears
,
she
said
nothing
but
this
one
word
:
``
Guarantees
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
as
I
do
n't
speak
to
her
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
.
He
was
*NL*
himself
very
moved
,
and
concealed
his
eyes
with
his
hand
as
best
*NL*
he
could
under
the
pretext
of
avoiding
the
dazzling
light
of
the
*NL*
third
tier
of
boxes
.
``
If
I
speak
she
may
suspect
the
excess
of
my
*NL*
emotion
,
the
sound
of
my
voice
will
betray
me
.
All
may
yet
be
lost
.
''
*NL*
His
struggles
were
more
painful
than
they
had
been
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
his
soul
had
had
the
time
to
become
moved
.
He
had
been
frightened
at
*NL*
seeing
Mathilde
piqued
with
vanity
.
Intoxicated
as
he
was
with
love
and
*NL*
pleasure
he
resolved
not
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
view
this
is
one
of
the
finest
traits
in
his
character
,
an
*NL*
individual
capable
of
such
an
effort
of
self-control
may
go
far
si
*NL*
_
fata
sinant
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
insisted
on
taking
Julien
back
to
the
hotel
.
*NL*
Luckily
it
was
raining
a
great
deal
,
but
the
marquise
had
him
placed
*NL*
opposite
her
,
talked
to
him
incessantly
,
and
prevented
him
saying
a
*NL*
single
word
to
her
daughter
.
One
might
have
thought
that
the
marquise
*NL*
was
nursing
Julien
's
happiness
for
him
;
no
longer
fearing
to
lose
*NL*
everything
through
his
excessive
emotion
,
he
madly
abandoned
himself
to
*NL*
his
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shall
I
dare
to
say
that
when
he
went
back
to
his
room
Julien
fell
*NL*
on
his
knees
and
covered
with
kisses
the
love
letters
which
prince
*NL*
Korasoff
had
given
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
I
owe
you
,
great
man
,
''
he
exclaimed
in
his
madness
.
Little
*NL*
by
little
he
regained
his
self-possession
.
He
compared
himself
to
a
*NL*
general
who
had
just
won
a
great
battle
.
``
My
advantage
is
definite
and
*NL*
immense
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
but
what
will
happen
to-morrow
?
One
*NL*
instant
may
ruin
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
passionate
gesture
he
opened
the
_
Memoirs
_
which
Napoleon
had
*NL*
dictated
at
St.
Helena
and
for
two
long
hours
forced
himself
to
read
*NL*
them
.
Only
his
eyes
read
;
no
matter
,
he
made
himself
do
it
.
During
this
*NL*
singular
reading
his
head
and
his
heart
rose
to
the
most
exalted
level
*NL*
and
worked
unconsciously
.
``
Her
heart
is
very
different
from
madame
de
*NL*
Renal
's
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
but
he
did
not
go
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frighten
her
!
''
he
suddenly
exclaimed
,
hurling
away
the
book
.
``
The
*NL*
enemy
will
only
obey
me
in
so
far
as
I
frighten
him
,
but
then
he
will
*NL*
not
dare
to
show
contempt
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Intoxicated
with
joy
he
walked
up
and
down
his
little
room
.
In
point
of
*NL*
fact
his
happiness
was
based
rather
on
pride
than
on
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frighten
her
!
''
he
repeated
proudly
,
and
he
had
cause
to
be
proud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Renal
always
doubted
even
in
her
happiest
moments
if
my
*NL*
love
was
equal
to
her
own
.
In
this
case
I
have
to
subjugate
a
demon
,
*NL*
consequently
I
must
subjugate
her
.
''
He
knew
quite
well
that
Mathilde
*NL*
would
be
in
the
library
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
of
the
*NL*
following
day
.
He
did
not
appear
before
nine
o'clock
.
He
was
burning
*NL*
with
love
,
but
his
head
dominated
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
a
single
minute
passed
without
his
repeating
to
himself
.
``
Keep
*NL*
her
obsessed
by
this
great
doubt
.
Does
he
love
me
?
''
Her
own
brilliant
*NL*
position
,
together
with
the
flattery
of
all
who
speak
to
her
,
tend
a
*NL*
little
too
much
to
make
her
reassure
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
her
sitting
on
the
divan
pale
and
calm
,
but
apparently
*NL*
completely
incapable
of
making
a
single
movement
.
She
held
out
her
*NL*
hand
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
one
,
it
is
true
I
have
offended
you
,
perhaps
you
are
angry
with
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
not
been
expecting
this
simple
tone
.
He
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
betraying
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
guarantees
,
my
dear
,
she
added
after
a
silence
which
she
had
*NL*
hoped
would
be
broken
.
Take
me
away
,
let
us
leave
for
London
.
I
shall
*NL*
be
ruined
,
dishonoured
for
ever
.
''
She
had
the
courage
to
take
her
hand
*NL*
away
from
Julien
to
cover
her
eyes
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
her
feelings
of
reserve
and
feminine
virtue
had
come
back
into
her
*NL*
soul
.
``
Well
,
dishonour
me
,
''
she
said
at
last
with
a
sigh
,
``
that
will
be
*NL*
a
guarantee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
happy
yesterday
,
because
I
had
the
courage
to
be
severe
with
*NL*
myself
,
''
thought
Julien
.
After
a
short
silence
he
had
sufficient
*NL*
control
over
his
heart
to
say
in
an
icy
tone
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
we
are
on
the
road
to
London
,
once
you
are
dishonoured
,
to
employ
*NL*
your
own
expression
,
who
will
answer
that
you
will
still
love
me
?
that
*NL*
my
very
presence
in
the
post-chaise
will
not
seem
importunate
?
I
am
not
*NL*
a
monster
;
to
have
ruined
your
reputation
will
only
make
me
still
more
*NL*
unhappy
.
It
is
not
your
position
in
society
which
is
the
obstacle
,
it
*NL*
is
unfortunately
your
own
character
.
Can
you
yourself
guarantee
that
*NL*
you
will
love
me
for
eight
days
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
let
her
love
me
for
eight
days
,
just
eight
days
,
''
whispered
*NL*
Julien
to
himself
,
``
and
I
will
die
of
happiness
.
What
do
I
care
for
*NL*
the
future
,
what
do
I
care
for
life
?
And
yet
if
I
wish
that
divine
*NL*
happiness
can
commence
this
very
minute
,
it
only
depends
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
saw
that
he
was
pensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
am
completely
unworthy
of
you
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
taking
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
kissed
her
,
but
at
the
same
time
the
iron
hand
of
duty
gripped
*NL*
his
heart
.
If
she
sees
how
much
I
adore
her
I
shall
lose
her
.
And
*NL*
before
leaving
her
arms
,
he
had
reassumed
all
that
dignity
which
is
*NL*
proper
to
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
managed
on
this
and
the
following
days
to
conceal
his
inordinate
*NL*
happiness
.
There
were
moments
when
he
even
refused
himself
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
clasping
her
in
his
arms
.
At
other
times
the
delirium
of
happiness
*NL*
prevailed
over
all
the
counsels
of
prudence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
accustomed
to
station
himself
near
a
bower
of
honeysuckle
*NL*
in
the
garden
arranged
in
such
a
way
so
as
to
conceal
the
ladder
when
*NL*
he
had
looked
up
at
Mathilde
's
blind
in
the
distance
,
and
lamented
her
*NL*
inconstancy
.
A
very
big
oak
tree
was
quite
near
,
and
the
trunk
of
that
*NL*
tree
prevented
him
from
being
seen
by
the
indiscreet
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
passed
with
Mathilde
over
this
very
place
which
recalled
his
*NL*
excessive
unhappiness
so
vividly
,
the
contrast
between
his
former
*NL*
despair
and
his
present
happiness
proved
too
much
for
his
character
.
*NL*
Tears
inundated
his
eyes
,
and
he
carried
his
sweetheart
's
hand
to
his
*NL*
lips
:
``
It
was
here
I
used
to
live
in
my
thoughts
of
you
,
it
was
from
*NL*
here
that
I
used
to
look
at
that
blind
,
and
waited
whole
hours
for
the
*NL*
happy
moment
when
I
would
see
that
hand
open
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
weakness
was
unreserved
.
He
portrayed
the
extremity
of
his
former
*NL*
despair
in
genuine
colours
which
could
not
possibly
have
been
invented
.
*NL*
Short
interjections
testified
to
that
present
happiness
which
had
put
*NL*
an
end
to
that
awful
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
,
what
am
I
doing
?
''
thought
Julien
,
suddenly
recovering
himself
.
*NL*
``
I
am
ruining
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
excessive
alarm
he
thought
that
he
already
detected
a
diminution
*NL*
of
the
love
in
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
eyes
.
It
was
an
illusion
,
but
*NL*
Julien
's
face
suddenly
changed
its
expression
and
became
overspread
*NL*
by
a
mortal
pallor
.
His
eyes
lost
their
fire
,
and
an
expression
of
*NL*
haughtiness
touched
with
malice
soon
succeeded
to
his
look
of
the
most
*NL*
genuine
and
unreserved
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
the
matter
with
you
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mathilde
to
him
,
both
*NL*
tenderly
and
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
lying
,
''
said
Julien
irritably
,
``
and
I
am
lying
to
you
.
I
am
*NL*
reproaching
myself
for
it
,
and
yet
God
knows
that
I
respect
you
*NL*
sufficiently
not
to
lie
to
you
.
You
love
me
,
you
are
devoted
to
me
,
and
*NL*
I
have
no
need
of
praises
in
order
to
please
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
heavens
!
are
all
the
charming
things
you
have
been
telling
me
*NL*
for
the
last
two
minutes
mere
phrases
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
reproach
myself
for
it
keenly
,
dear
one
.
I
once
made
them
up
for
*NL*
a
woman
who
loved
me
,
and
bored
me
--
it
is
the
weakness
of
my
character
.
*NL*
I
denounce
myself
to
you
,
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bitter
tears
streamed
over
Mathilde
's
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
some
trifle
offends
me
and
throws
me
back
on
my
*NL*
meditation
,
''
continued
Julien
,
``
my
abominable
memory
,
which
I
curse
at
*NL*
this
very
minute
,
offers
me
a
resource
,
and
I
abuse
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
must
have
slipped
,
without
knowing
it
,
into
some
action
which
has
*NL*
displeased
you
,
''
said
Mathilde
with
a
charming
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
one
day
that
when
you
passed
near
this
honeysuckle
you
*NL*
picked
a
flower
,
M.
de
Luz
took
it
from
you
and
you
let
him
keep
it
.
I
*NL*
was
two
paces
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
de
Luz
?
It
is
impossible
,
''
replied
Mathilde
with
all
her
natural
*NL*
haughtiness
.
``
I
do
not
do
things
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
of
it
,
''
Julien
replied
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
it
is
true
,
''
said
Mathilde
,
as
she
sadly
lowered
her
*NL*
eyes
.
She
knew
positively
that
many
months
had
elapsed
since
she
had
*NL*
allowed
M.
de
Luz
to
do
such
a
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
looked
at
her
with
ineffable
tenderness
,
``
No
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
she
does
not
love
me
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
she
rallied
him
with
a
laugh
on
his
fancy
for
madame
de
*NL*
Fervaques
.
``
Think
of
a
bourgeois
loving
a
parvenu
,
those
are
perhaps
*NL*
the
only
type
of
hearts
that
my
Julien
can
not
make
mad
with
love
.
She
*NL*
has
made
you
into
a
real
dandy
,
''
she
said
playing
with
his
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
period
when
he
thought
himself
scorned
by
Mathilde
,
Julien
*NL*
had
become
one
of
the
best
dressed
men
in
Paris
.
He
had
,
moreover
,
*NL*
a
further
advantage
over
other
dandies
,
in
as
much
as
once
he
had
*NL*
finished
dressing
he
never
gave
a
further
thought
to
his
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
still
piqued
Mathilde
,
Julien
continued
to
copy
out
the
*NL*
Russian
letters
and
send
them
to
the
marechale
.

Alas

why
these
things
and
not
other
*NL*
things
?

_
Beaumarchais

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
An
English
traveller
tells
of
the
intimacy
in
which
he
lived
with
a
*NL*
tiger
.
He
had
trained
it
and
would
caress
it
,
but
he
always
kept
a
*NL*
cocked
pistol
on
his
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
only
abandoned
himself
to
the
fulness
of
his
happiness
in
those
*NL*
moments
when
Mathilde
could
not
read
the
expression
in
his
eyes
.
He
*NL*
scrupulously
performed
his
duty
of
addressing
some
harsh
word
to
her
*NL*
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mathilde
's
sweetness
,
which
he
noticed
with
some
surprise
,
*NL*
together
with
the
completeness
of
her
devotion
were
on
the
point
of
*NL*
depriving
him
of
all
self-control
,
he
was
courageous
enough
to
leave
*NL*
her
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
loved
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Life
had
previously
always
dragged
along
at
a
tortoise
pace
,
but
now
it
*NL*
flew
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
,
however
,
her
pride
required
to
find
a
vent
in
some
way
or
other
,
*NL*
she
wished
to
expose
herself
to
all
the
dangers
in
which
her
love
could
*NL*
involve
her
.
It
was
Julien
who
was
prudent
,
and
it
was
only
when
it
was
*NL*
a
question
of
danger
that
she
did
not
follow
her
own
inclination
;
but
*NL*
submissive
,
and
almost
humble
as
she
was
when
with
him
,
she
only
showed
*NL*
additional
haughtiness
to
everyone
in
the
house
who
came
near
her
,
*NL*
whether
relatives
or
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
she
would
call
Julien
to
her
in
the
salon
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
sixty
people
,
and
have
a
long
and
private
conversation
with
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
Tanbeau
installed
himself
one
day
close
to
them
.
She
*NL*
requested
him
to
go
and
fetch
from
the
library
the
volume
of
Smollet
*NL*
which
deals
with
the
revolution
of
1688
,
and
when
he
hesitated
,
added
*NL*
with
an
expression
of
insulting
haughtiness
,
which
was
a
veritable
balm
*NL*
to
Julien
's
soul
,
``
Do
n't
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
noticed
that
little
monster
's
expression
?
''
he
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
uncle
has
been
in
attendance
in
this
salon
for
ten
or
twelve
*NL*
years
,
otherwise
I
would
have
had
him
packed
off
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
behaviour
towards
MM
.
de
Croisenois
,
de
Luz
,
etc.
,
though
outwardly
*NL*
perfectly
polite
,
was
in
reality
scarcely
less
provocative
.
Mathilde
*NL*
keenly
reproached
herself
for
all
the
confidential
remarks
about
them
*NL*
which
she
had
formerly
made
to
Julien
,
and
all
the
more
so
since
she
*NL*
did
not
dare
to
confess
that
she
had
exaggerated
to
him
the
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
almost
absolutely
innocent
manifestations
of
interest
of
which
these
*NL*
gentlemen
had
been
the
objects
.
In
spite
of
her
best
resolutions
her
*NL*
womanly
pride
invariably
prevented
her
from
saying
to
Julien
,
``
It
was
*NL*
because
I
was
talking
to
you
that
I
found
a
pleasure
in
describing
my
*NL*
weakness
in
not
drawing
my
hand
away
,
when
M.
de
Croisenois
had
placed
*NL*
his
on
a
marble
table
and
had
just
touched
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
,
as
soon
as
one
of
these
gentlemen
had
been
speaking
to
her
for
*NL*
some
moments
,
she
found
she
had
a
question
to
put
to
Julien
,
and
she
*NL*
made
this
an
excuse
for
keeping
him
by
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
discovered
that
she
was
_
enceinte
_
and
joyfully
informed
Julien
of
*NL*
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
doubt
me
now
?
Is
it
not
a
guarantee
?
I
am
your
wife
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
announcement
struck
Julien
with
profound
astonishment
.
He
was
on
*NL*
the
point
of
forgetting
the
governing
principle
of
his
conduct
.
How
am
*NL*
I
to
be
deliberately
cold
and
insulting
towards
this
poor
young
girl
,
*NL*
who
is
ruining
herself
for
my
sake
.
And
if
she
looked
at
all
ill
,
*NL*
he
could
not
,
even
on
those
days
when
the
terrible
voice
of
wisdom
*NL*
made
itself
heard
,
find
the
courage
to
address
to
her
one
of
those
*NL*
harsh
remarks
which
his
experience
had
found
so
indispensable
to
the
*NL*
preservation
of
their
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
write
to
my
father
,
''
said
Mathilde
to
him
one
day
,
``
he
is
*NL*
more
than
a
father
to
me
,
he
is
a
friend
;
that
being
so
,
I
think
it
*NL*
unworthy
both
of
you
and
of
myself
to
try
and
deceive
him
,
even
for
a
*NL*
single
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
heavens
,
what
are
you
going
to
do
?
''
said
Julien
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
duty
,
''
she
answered
with
eyes
shining
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
she
was
showing
more
nobility
than
her
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
will
pack
me
off
in
disgrace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
his
right
to
do
so
,
we
must
respect
it
.
I
will
give
you
my
arm
,
*NL*
and
we
will
go
out
by
the
front
door
in
full
daylight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
thunderstruck
and
requested
her
to
put
it
off
for
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
,
''
she
answered
,
``
it
is
the
voice
of
honour
,
I
have
seen
my
*NL*
duty
,
I
must
follow
it
,
and
follow
it
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
order
you
to
put
it
off
,
''
said
Julien
at
last
.
``
Your
honour
*NL*
is
safe
for
the
present
.
I
am
your
husband
.
The
position
of
us
will
be
*NL*
changed
by
this
momentous
step
.
I
too
am
within
my
rights
.
To-day
is
*NL*
Tuesday
,
next
Tuesday
is
the
duke
de
Retz
's
at
home
;
when
M.
de
la
Mole
*NL*
comes
home
in
the
evening
the
porter
will
give
him
the
fatal
letter
.
*NL*
His
only
thought
is
to
make
you
a
duchess
,
I
am
sure
of
it
.
Think
of
*NL*
his
unhappiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
,
think
of
his
vengeance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
that
I
pity
my
benefactor
,
and
am
grieved
at
injuring
him
,
*NL*
but
I
do
not
fear
,
and
shall
never
fear
anyone

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
yielded
.
This
was
the
first
occasion
,
since
she
had
informed
*NL*
Julien
of
her
condition
,
that
he
had
spoken
to
her
authoritatively
.
*NL*
She
had
never
loved
him
so
much
.
The
tender
part
of
his
soul
had
*NL*
found
happiness
in
seizing
on
Mathilde
's
condition
as
an
excuse
*NL*
for
refraining
from
his
cruel
remarks
to
her
.
The
question
of
the
*NL*
confession
to
M.
de
la
Mole
deeply
moved
him
.
Was
he
going
to
be
*NL*
separated
from
Mathilde
?
And
,
however
grieved
she
would
be
to
see
him
*NL*
go
,
would
she
have
a
thought
for
him
after
his
departure
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
almost
equally
horrified
by
the
thought
of
the
justified
*NL*
reproaches
which
the
marquis
might
address
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
he
confessed
to
Mathilde
the
second
reason
for
his
*NL*
anxiety
,
and
then
led
away
by
his
love
,
confessed
the
first
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
changed
colour
.
``
Would
it
really
make
you
unhappy
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
him
,
``
to
pass
six
months
far
away
from
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Infinitely
so
.
It
is
the
only
thing
in
the
world
which
terrifies
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
was
very
happy
.
Julien
had
played
his
part
so
assiduously
that
*NL*
he
had
succeeded
in
making
her
think
that
she
was
the
one
of
the
two
*NL*
who
loved
the
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fatal
Tuesday
arrived
.
When
the
marquis
came
in
at
midnight
he
*NL*
found
a
letter
addressed
to
him
,
which
was
only
to
be
opened
himself
*NL*
when
no
one
was
there
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
social
ties
have
been
broken
between
us
,
only
those
*NL*
of
nature
remain
.
Next
to
my
husband
,
you
are
and
always
*NL*
will
be
the
being
I
shall
always
hold
most
dear
.
My
*NL*
eyes
are
full
of
tears
,
I
am
thinking
of
the
pain
that
*NL*
I
am
causing
you
,
but
if
my
shame
was
to
be
prevented
*NL*
from
becoming
public
,
and
you
were
to
be
given
time
to
*NL*
reflect
and
act
,
I
could
not
postpone
any
longer
the
*NL*
confession
that
I
owe
you
.
If
your
affection
for
me
,
*NL*
which
I
know
is
extremely
deep
,
is
good
enough
to
grant
*NL*
me
a
small
allowance
,
I
will
go
and
settle
with
my
*NL*
husband
anywhere
you
like
,
in
Switzerland
,
for
instance
.
*NL*
His
name
is
so
obscure
that
no
one
would
recognize
*NL*
in
Madame
Sorel
,
the
daughter-in-law
of
a
Verrieres
*NL*
carpenter
,
your
daughter
.
That
is
the
name
which
I
have
*NL*
so
much
difficulty
in
writing
.
I
fear
your
wrath
against
*NL*
Julien
,
it
seems
so
justified
.
I
shall
not
be
a
duchess
,
*NL*
my
father
;
but
I
knew
it
when
I
loved
him
;
for
I
was
*NL*
the
one
who
loved
him
first
,
it
was
I
who
seduced
him
.
*NL*
I
have
inherited
from
you
too
lofty
a
soul
to
fix
my
*NL*
attention
on
what
either
is
or
appears
to
be
vulgar
.
It
*NL*
is
in
vain
that
I
thought
of
M.
Croisenois
with
a
view
*NL*
to
pleasing
you
.
Why
did
you
place
real
merit
under
my
*NL*
eyes
?
You
told
me
yourself
on
my
return
from
Hyeres
,
*NL*
`
that
young
Sorel
is
the
one
person
who
amuses
me
,
'
the
*NL*
poor
boy
is
as
grieved
as
I
am
if
it
is
possible
,
at
the
*NL*
pain
this
letter
will
give
you
.
I
can
not
prevent
you
*NL*
being
irritated
as
a
father
,
but
love
me
as
a
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Julien
respected
me
.
If
he
sometimes
spoke
to
me
,
*NL*
it
was
only
by
reason
of
his
deep
gratitude
towards
*NL*
yourself
,
for
the
natural
dignity
of
his
character
*NL*
induces
him
to
keep
to
his
official
capacity
in
any
*NL*
answers
he
may
make
to
anyone
who
is
so
much
above
*NL*
him
.
He
has
a
keen
and
instinctive
appreciation
of
the
*NL*
difference
of
social
rank
.
It
was
I
-LRB-
I
confess
it
with
a
*NL*
blush
to
my
best
friend
,
and
I
shall
never
make
such
a
*NL*
confession
to
anyone
else
-RRB-
who
clasped
his
arm
one
day
*NL*
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
need
you
be
irritated
with
him
,
after
twenty-four
*NL*
hours
have
elapsed
?
My
own
lapse
is
irreparable
.
If
you
*NL*
insist
on
it
,
the
assurance
of
his
profound
respect
and
*NL*
of
his
desperate
grief
at
having
displeased
you
,
can
*NL*
be
conveyed
to
you
through
me
.
You
need
not
see
him
at
*NL*
all
,
but
I
shall
go
and
join
him
wherever
he
wishes
.
*NL*
It
is
his
right
and
it
is
my
duty
.
He
is
the
father
of
*NL*
my
child
.
If
your
kindness
will
go
so
far
as
to
grant
*NL*
us
six
thousand
francs
to
live
on
,
I
will
receive
it
*NL*
with
gratitude
;
if
not

Julien
reckons
on
establishing
*NL*
himself
at
Besancon
,
where
he
will
set
up
as
a
Latin
and
*NL*
literature
master
.
However
low
may
have
been
the
station
*NL*
from
which
he
springs
,
I
am
certain
he
will
raise
*NL*
himself
.
With
him
I
do
not
fear
obscurity
.
If
there
is
*NL*
a
revolution
,
I
am
sure
that
he
will
play
a
prime
part
.
*NL*
Can
you
say
as
much
for
any
of
those
who
have
asked
*NL*
for
my
hand
?
They
have
fine
estates
,
you
say
.
I
can
not
*NL*
consider
that
circumstance
a
reason
for
admiring
them
.
*NL*
My
Julien
would
attain
a
high
position
,
even
under
the
*NL*
present
regime
,
if
he
had
a
million
and
my
father
's
*NL*
protection
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
,
who
knew
that
the
marquis
was
a
man
who
always
abandoned
*NL*
himself
to
his
first
impulse
,
had
written
eight
pages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
do
?
''
said
Julien
to
himself
while
M.
de
la
Mole
was
*NL*
reading
this
letter
.
``
Where
is
-LRB-
first
-RRB-
my
duty
;
-LRB-
second
-RRB-
my
interest

*NL*
My
debt
to
him
is
immense
.
Without
him
I
should
have
been
a
menial
*NL*
scoundrel
,
and
not
even
enough
of
a
scoundrel
to
be
hated
and
*NL*
persecuted
by
the
others
.
He
has
made
me
a
man
of
the
world
.
The
*NL*
villainous
acts
which
I
now
have
to
do
are
-LRB-
first
-RRB-
less
frequent
;
*NL*
-LRB-
second
-RRB-
less
mean
.
That
is
more
than
as
if
he
had
given
me
a
million

*NL*
I
am
indebted
to
him
for
this
cross
and
the
reputation
of
having
*NL*
rendered
those
alleged
diplomatic
services
,
which
have
lifted
me
out
of
*NL*
the
ruck

If

himself

conduct

would

*NL*
Julien
was
sharply
interrupted
by
M.
de
la
Mole
's
old
valet
.
``
The
*NL*
marquis
wants
to
see
you
at
once

dressed

The
valet
*NL*
added
in
a
low
voice

as
he
walked
by
Julien

side
,
``
He
is
beside

CHAPTER
LXIII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
HELL
OF
WEAKNESS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
clumsy
lapidary
,
in
cutting
this
diamond
,
deprived
*NL*
it
of
some
of
its
most
brilliant
facets
.
In
the
middle
*NL*
ages
,
nay
,
even
under
Richelieu
,
the
Frenchman
had
*NL*
_
force
of
will
_
.
--
_
Mirabeau
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
found
the
marquis
furious
.
For
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
*NL*
life
this
nobleman
showed
bad
form
.
He
loaded
Julien
with
all
the
*NL*
insults
that
came
to
his
lips
.
Our
hero
was
astonished
,
and
his
*NL*
patience
was
tried
,
but
his
gratitude
remained
unshaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
poor
man
now
sees
the
annihilation
,
in
a
single
minute
,
of
all
*NL*
the
fine
plans
which
he
has
long
cherished
in
his
heart
.
But
I
owe
it
*NL*
to
him
to
answer
.
My
silence
tends
to
increase
his
anger
.
''
The
part
of
*NL*
Tartuffe
supplied
the
answer
;
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
an
angel
...
I
served
you
well
;
you
paid
me
generously
...
I
*NL*
was
grateful
,
but
I
am
twenty-two
...
Only
you
and
that
charming
person
*NL*
understood
my
thoughts
in
this
household
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monster
,
''
exclaimed
the
marquis
.
``
Charming
!
Charming
,
to
be
sure
!
The
*NL*
day
when
you
found
her
charming
you
ought
to
have
fled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tried
to
.
It
was
then
that
I
asked
permission
to
leave
for
*NL*
Languedoc
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tired
of
stampeding
about
and
overcome
by
his
grief
,
the
marquis
threw
*NL*
himself
into
an
arm-chair
.
Julien
heard
him
whispering
to
himself
,
``
No
,
*NL*
no
,
he
is
not
a
wicked
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
,
towards
you
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
falling
on
his
knees
.
*NL*
But
he
felt
extremely
ashamed
of
this
manifestation
,
and
very
quickly
*NL*
got
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
was
really
transported
.
When
he
saw
this
movement
,
he
*NL*
began
again
to
load
him
with
abominable
insults
,
which
were
worthy
of
*NL*
the
driver
of
a
fiacre
.
The
novelty
of
these
oaths
perhaps
acted
as
a
*NL*
distraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
is
my
daughter
to
go
by
the
name
of
madame
Sorel
?
What
!
is
my
*NL*
daughter
not
to
be
a
duchess
?
''
Each
time
that
these
two
ideas
presented
*NL*
themselves
in
all
their
clearness
M.
de
la
Mole
was
a
prey
to
torture
,
*NL*
and
lost
all
power
over
the
movements
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
afraid
of
being
beaten
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
lucid
intervals
,
when
he
was
beginning
to
get
accustomed
to
his
*NL*
unhappiness
,
the
marquis
addressed
to
Julien
reproaches
which
were
*NL*
reasonable
enough
.
``
You
should
have
fled
,
sir
,
''
he
said
to
him
.
``
Your
*NL*
duty
was
to
flee
.
You
are
the
lowest
of
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
approached
the
table
and
wrote
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
found
my
life
unbearable
for
a
long
time
;
I
am
*NL*
putting
an
end
to
it

request
monsieur
the
marquis
to
*NL*
accept
my
apologies

together
with
the
expression
of
my
*NL*
infinite
gratitude
-RRB-
for
any
embarrassment
that
may
be
*NL*
occasioned
by
my
death
in
his
hotel
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Kindly
run
your
eye
over
this
paper

the
marquis
,
''
said
Julien
.
*NL*
``
Kill
me
,
or
have
me
killed
by
your
valet

It
is
one
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning

I
will
go
and
walk
in
the
garden
in
the
direction
of
the
wall
*NL*
at
the
bottom

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

devil

cried
the
marquis
,
as
he
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand

thought
Julien
.
``
He
would
not
be
sorry

I
were
to

spare

trouble

killing

*NL*
``
Let
him
kill

But
,
by
heaven
,
I
love
life

I
owe
it
to

*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
,
which
had
not
previously
presented
itself
with
so
much
*NL*
definiteness
to
his
imagination
,
completely
engrossed
him
during
his
*NL*
walk
after
the
first
few
minutes
which
he
had
spent
thinking
about
his
*NL*
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
novel
interest
turned
him
into
a
prudent
man
.
``
I
need
advice
as
to
*NL*
how
to
behave
towards
this
infuriated
man
...
He
is
devoid
of
reason
;
*NL*
he
is
capable
of
everything
.
Fouque
is
too
far
away
;
besides
,
he
would
*NL*
not
understand
the
emotions
of
a
heart
like
the
marquis
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Altamira
...
am
I
certain
of
eternal
silence
?
My
request
*NL*
for
advice
must
not
be
a
fresh
step
which
will
raise
still
further
*NL*
complications
.
Alas
!
I
have
no
one
left
but
the
gloomy
abbe
Pirard
.
His
*NL*
mind
is
crabbed
by
Jansenism
...
A
damned
Jesuit
would
know
the
world
,
*NL*
and
would
be
more
in
my
line
.
M.
Pirard
is
capable
of
beating
me
at
the
*NL*
very
mention
of
my
crime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
genius
of
Tartuffe
came
to
Julien
's
help
.
``
Well
,
I
will
go
and
*NL*
confess
to
him
.
''
This
was
his
final
resolution
after
having
walked
*NL*
about
in
the
garden
for
two
good
hours
.
He
no
longer
thought
about
*NL*
being
surprised
by
a
gun
shot
.
He
was
feeling
sleepy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
early
the
next
day
,
Julien
was
several
leagues
away
from
Paris
*NL*
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
severe
Jansenist
.
He
found
to
his
great
*NL*
astonishment
that
he
was
not
unduly
surprised
at
his
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
perhaps
to
reproach
myself
,
''
said
the
abbe
,
who
seemed
more
*NL*
anxious
than
irritated
.
``
I
thought
I
guessed
that
love

My
affection
*NL*
for
you

my
unhappy
boy

prevented
me
from
warning
the
father

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
he
do

said
Julien
keenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
he
loved
the
abbe
,
and
would
have
found
a
scene
between
*NL*
them
very
painful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
three
alternatives

continued
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
de
la
Mole

have
me
put
to
death

and
he
mentioned
the
suicide
*NL*
letter
which
he
had
left
with
the
Marquis
;
-LRB-

-RRB-
``
He
can
get
Count

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

abbe
furiously
as
he
got
up

it
,
that
will
be
the
first
thought
of
that
*NL*
depraved
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
Paris
,
Mathilde
was
in
despair
.
She
had
seen
her
father
about
seven
*NL*
o'clock
.
He
had
shown
her
Julien
's
letter
.
She
feared
that
he
might
*NL*
have
considered
it
noble
to
put
an
end
to
his
life
;
``
and
without
my
*NL*
permission
?
''
she
said
to
herself
with
a
pain
due
solely
to
her
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
dies
I
shall
die
,
''
she
said
to
her
father
.
``
It
will
be
you
*NL*
who
will
be
the
cause
of
his
death
...
Perhaps
you
will
rejoice
at
*NL*
it
but
I
swear
by
his
shades
that
I
shall
at
once
go
into
mourning
,
*NL*
and
shall
publicly
appear
as
_
Madame
the
widow
Sorel
_
,
I
shall
send
*NL*
out
my
invitations
,
you
can
count
on
it
...
You
will
find
me
neither
*NL*
pusillanimous
nor
cowardly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
love
went
to
the
point
of
madness
.
M.
de
la
Mole
was
flabbergasted
*NL*
in
his
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
regard
what
had
happened
with
a
certain
amount
of
logic
.
*NL*
Mathilde
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
.
The
marquis
felt
an
immense
*NL*
weight
off
his
mind
,
and
was
particularly
flattered
when
he
noticed
*NL*
that
she
had
said
nothing
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
dismounting
from
his
horse
.
Mathilde
had
him
called
and
*NL*
threw
herself
into
his
arms
almost
beneath
the
very
eyes
of
her
*NL*
chambermaid
.
Julien
was
not
very
appreciative
of
this
transport
.
He
had
*NL*
come
away
from
his
long
consultation
with
the
abbe
Pirard
in
a
very
*NL*
diplomatic
and
calculating
mood
.
The
calculation
of
possibilities
had
*NL*
killed
his
imagination
.
Mathilde
told
him
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
that
*NL*
she
had
read
his
suicide
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
may
change
his
mind
;
do
me
the
favour
of
leaving
for
*NL*
Villequier
this
very
minute
.
Mount
your
horse
again
,
and
leave
the
*NL*
hotel
before
they
get
up
from
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Julien
's
coldness
and
astonishment
showed
no
sign
of
abatement
,
*NL*
she
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
manage
our
affairs
,
''
she
exclaimed
ecstatically
,
as
she
clasped
*NL*
him
in
her
arms
.
``
You
know
,
dear
,
it
is
not
of
my
own
free
will
that
*NL*
I
separate
from
you
.
Write
under
cover
to
my
maid
.
Address
it
in
a
*NL*
strange
hand-writing
,
I
will
write
volumes
to
you
.
Adieu
,
flee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
word
wounded
Julien
,
but
he
none
the
less
obeyed
.
``
It
will
*NL*
be
fatal
,
''
he
thought
``
if
,
in
their
most
gracious
moments
these
*NL*
aristocrats
manage
to
shock
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
firmly
opposed
all
her
father
's
prudent
plans
.
She
would
*NL*
not
open
negotiations
on
any
other
basis
except
this
.
She
was
to
be
*NL*
Madame
Sorel
,
and
was
either
to
live
with
her
husband
in
poverty
in
*NL*
Switzerland
,
or
with
her
father
in
Paris
.
She
rejected
absolutely
the
*NL*
suggestion
of
a
secret
accouchement
.
``
In
that
case
I
should
begin
to
*NL*
be
confronted
with
a
prospect
of
calumny
and
dishonour
.
I
shall
go
*NL*
travelling
with
my
husband
two
months
after
the
marriage
,
and
it
will
*NL*
be
easy
to
pretend
that
my
son
was
born
at
a
proper
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
firmness
though
at
first
received
with
violent
fits
of
anger
,
*NL*
eventually
made
the
marquis
hesitate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
he
said
to
his
daughter
in
a
moment
of
emotion
,
``
is
a
gift
of
*NL*
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
.
Send
it
to
your
Julien
,
and
let
him
quickly
*NL*
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
retract
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
obey
Mathilde
,
whose
imperious
temper
he
well
knew
,
Julien
*NL*
had
travelled
forty
useless
leagues
;
he
was
superintending
the
accounts
*NL*
of
the
farmers
at
Villequier
.
This
act
of
benevolence
on
the
part
of
*NL*
the
marquis
occasioned
his
return
.
He
went
and
asked
asylum
of
the
abbe
*NL*
Pirard
,
who
had
become
Mathilde
's
most
useful
ally
during
his
absence
.
*NL*
Every
time
that
he
was
questioned
by
the
marquis
,
he
would
prove
to
him
*NL*
that
any
other
course
except
public
marriage
would
be
a
crime
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
happily
,
''
added
the
abbe
,
``
worldly
wisdom
is
in
this
instance
in
*NL*
agreement
with
religion
.
Could
one
,
in
view
of
Mdlle
.
de
la
Mole
's
*NL*
passionate
character
,
rely
for
a
minute
on
her
keeping
any
secret
which
*NL*
she
did
not
herself
wish
to
preserve
?
If
one
does
not
reconcile
oneself
*NL*
to
the
frankness
of
a
public
marriage
,
society
will
concern
itself
much
*NL*
longer
with
this
strange
mesalliance
__
.
Everything
must
be
said
all
*NL*
at
once
without
either
the
appearance
or
the
reality
of
the
slightest
*NL*
mystery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
said
the
marquis
pensively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
or
three
friends
of
M.
de
la
Mole
were
of
the
same
opinion
as
the
*NL*
abbe
Pirard
.
The
great
obstacle
in
their
view
was
Mathilde
's
decided
*NL*
character
.
But
in
spite
of
all
these
fine
arguments
the
marquis
's
soul
*NL*
could
not
reconcile
itself
to
giving
up
all
hopes
of
a
coronet
for
his
*NL*
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ransacked
his
memory
and
his
imagination
for
all
the
variations
of
*NL*
knavery
and
duplicity
which
had
been
feasible
in
his
youth
.
Yielding
to
*NL*
necessity
and
having
fear
of
the
law
seemed
absurd
and
humiliating
for
*NL*
a
man
in
his
position
.
He
was
paying
dearly
now
for
the
luxury
of
those
*NL*
enchanting
dreams
concerning
the
future
of
his
cherished
daughter
in
*NL*
which
he
had
indulged
for
the
last
ten
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
could
have
anticipated
it
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
A
girl
of
so
*NL*
proud
a
character
,
of
so
lofty
a
disposition
,
who
is
even
prouder
than
*NL*
I
am
of
the
name
she
bears
?
A
girl
whose
hand
has
already
been
asked
*NL*
for
by
all
the
cream
of
the
nobility
of
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
give
up
all
faith
in
prudence
.
This
age
is
made
to
confound
*NL*
everything

We
are
marching
towards
chaos

CHAPTER
LXIV
*NL*
*NL*
A
MAN
OF
INTELLECT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
prefect
said
to
himself
as
he
rode
along
the
highway
*NL*
on
horseback
,
``
why
should
I
not
be
a
minister
,
a
*NL*
president
of
the
council
,
a
duke
?
This
is
how
I
should
*NL*
make
war
...
By
these
means
I
should
have
all
the
*NL*
reformers
put
in
irons
.
''
--
_
The
Globe
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
No
argument
will
succeed
in
destroying
the
paramount
influence
of
ten
*NL*
years
of
agreeable
dreaming
.
The
marquis
thought
it
illogical
to
be
*NL*
angry
,
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
forgive
.
``
If
only
this
Julien
*NL*
could
die
by
accident
,
''
he
sometimes
said
to
himself
.
It
was
in
this
*NL*
way
that
his
depressed
imagination
found
a
certain
relief
in
running
*NL*
after
the
most
absurd
chimaeras
.
They
paralysed
the
influence
of
the
*NL*
wise
arguments
of
the
abbe
Pirard
.
A
month
went
by
in
this
way
without
*NL*
negotiations
advancing
one
single
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
had
in
this
family
matter
,
just
as
he
had
in
politics
,
*NL*
brilliant
ideas
over
which
he
would
be
enthusiastic
for
two
or
three
*NL*
days
.
And
then
a
line
of
tactics
would
fail
to
please
him
because
it
*NL*
was
based
on
sound
arguments
,
while
arguments
only
found
favour
in
his
*NL*
eyes
in
so
far
as
they
were
based
on
his
favourite
plan
.
He
would
work
*NL*
for
three
days
with
all
the
ardour
and
enthusiasm
of
a
poet
on
bringing
*NL*
matters
to
a
certain
stage
;
on
the
following
day
he
would
not
give
it
a
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
at
first
disconcerted
by
the
slowness
of
the
marquis
;
*NL*
but
,
after
some
weeks
,
he
began
to
surmise
that
M.
de
La
Mole
had
no
*NL*
definite
plan
with
regard
to
this
matter
.
Madame
de
La
Mole
and
the
*NL*
whole
household
believed
that
Julien
was
travelling
in
the
provinces
*NL*
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
estates
;
he
was
in
hiding
*NL*
in
the
parsonage
of
the
abbe
Pirard
and
saw
Mathilde
every
day
;
*NL*
every
morning
she
would
spend
an
hour
with
her
father
,
but
they
would
*NL*
sometimes
go
for
weeks
on
end
without
talking
of
the
matter
which
*NL*
engrossed
all
their
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
know
where
the
man
is
,
''
said
the
marquis
to
her
one
*NL*
day
.
``
Send
him
this
letter
.
''
Mathilde
read
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Languedoc
estates
bring
in
20,600
francs
.
I
give
10,600
francs
to
*NL*
my
daughter
,
and
10,000
francs
to
M.
Julien
Sorel
.
It
is
understood
*NL*
that
I
give
the
actual
estates
.
Tell
the
notary
to
draw
up
two
separate
*NL*
deeds
of
gift
,
and
to
bring
them
to
me
to-morrow
,
after
this
there
are
*NL*
to
be
no
more
relations
between
us
.
Ah
,
Monsieur
,
could
I
have
expected
*NL*
all
this
?
The
marquis
de
La
Mole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
very
much
,
''
said
Mathilde
gaily
.
``
We
will
go
and
settle
in
*NL*
the
Chateau
d'Aiguillon
,
between
Agen
and
Marmande
.
The
country
is
said
*NL*
to
be
as
beautiful
as
Italy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
gift
was
an
extreme
surprise
to
Julien
.
He
was
no
longer
the
cold
,
*NL*
severe
man
whom
we
have
hitherto
known
.
His
thoughts
were
engrossed
in
*NL*
advance
by
his
son
's
destiny
.
This
unexpected
fortune
,
substantial
as
*NL*
it
was
for
a
man
as
poor
as
himself
,
made
him
ambitious
.
He
pictured
*NL*
a
time
when
both
his
wife
and
himself
would
have
an
income
of
36,000
*NL*
francs
.
As
for
Mathilde
,
all
her
emotions
were
concentrated
on
her
*NL*
adoration
for
her
husband
,
for
that
was
the
name
by
which
her
pride
*NL*
insisted
on
calling
Julien
.
Her
one
great
ambition
was
to
secure
the
*NL*
recognition
of
her
marriage
.
She
passed
her
time
in
exaggerating
to
*NL*
herself
the
consummate
prudence
which
she
had
manifested
in
linking
her
*NL*
fate
to
that
of
a
superior
man
.
The
idea
of
personal
merit
became
a
*NL*
positive
craze
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
almost
continuous
absence
,
coupled
with
the
complications
of
*NL*
business
matters
and
the
little
time
available
in
which
to
talk
love
,
*NL*
completed
the
good
effect
produced
by
the
wise
tactics
which
Julien
had
*NL*
previously
discovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
finished
by
losing
patience
at
seeing
so
little
of
the
man
*NL*
whom
she
had
come
really
to
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
of
irritation
she
wrote
to
her
father
and
commenced
her
*NL*
letter
like
Othello
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
very
choice
is
sufficient
proof
that
I
have
preferred
Julien
to
all
*NL*
the
advantages
which
society
offered
to
the
daughter
of
the
marquis
*NL*
de
la
Mole
.
Such
pleasures
,
based
as
they
are
on
prestige
and
petty
*NL*
vanity
mean
nothing
to
me
.
It
is
now
nearly
six
weeks
since
I
have
*NL*
lived
separated
from
my
husband
.
That
is
sufficient
to
manifest
my
*NL*
respect
for
yourself
.
Before
next
Thursday
I
shall
leave
the
paternal
*NL*
house
.
Your
acts
of
kindness
have
enriched
us
.
No
one
knows
my
secret
*NL*
except
the
venerable
abbe
Pirard
.
I
shall
go
to
him
:
he
will
marry
us
,
*NL*
and
an
hour
after
the
ceremony
we
shall
be
on
the
road
to
Languedoc
,
*NL*
and
we
will
never
appear
again
in
Paris
except
by
your
instructions
.
*NL*
But
what
cuts
me
to
the
quick
is
that
all
this
will
provide
the
subject
*NL*
matter
for
piquant
anecdotes
against
me
and
against
yourself
.
May
not
*NL*
the
epigrams
of
a
foolish
public
compel
our
excellent
Norbert
to
pick
a
*NL*
quarrel
with
Julien
,
under
such
circumstances
I
know
I
should
have
no
*NL*
control
over
him
.
We
should
discover
in
his
soul
the
mark
of
the
rebel
*NL*
plebian
.
Oh
father
,
I
entreat
you
on
my
knees
,
come
and
be
present
at
*NL*
my
marriage
in
M.
Pirard
's
church
next
Thursday
.
It
will
blunt
the
*NL*
sting
of
malignant
scandal
and
will
guarantee
the
life
's
happiness
of
*NL*
your
only
daughter
,
and
of
that
of
my
husband
,
etc.

etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
threw
the
marquis
's
soul
into
a
strange
embarrassment
.
*NL*
He
must
at
last
take
a
definite
line
.
All
his
little
habits
:
all
his
*NL*
vulgar
friends
had
lost
their
influence
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
these
strange
circumstances
the
great
lines
of
his
character
,
*NL*
which
had
been
formed
by
the
events
of
his
youth
,
reassumed
all
their
*NL*
original
force
.
The
misfortunes
of
the
emigration
had
made
him
into
*NL*
an
imaginative
man
.
After
having
enjoyed
for
two
years
an
immense
*NL*
fortune
and
all
the
distinctions
of
the
court
,
1790
had
flung
him
into
*NL*
the
awful
miseries
of
the
emigration
.
This
hard
schooling
had
changed
*NL*
the
character
of
a
spirit
of
twenty-two
.
In
essence
,
he
was
not
so
*NL*
much
dominated
by
his
present
riches
as
encamped
in
their
midst
.
But
*NL*
that
very
imagination
which
had
preserved
his
soul
from
the
taint
of
*NL*
avarice
,
had
made
him
a
victim
of
a
mad
passion
for
seeing
his
daughter
*NL*
decorated
by
a
fine
title
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
six
weeks
which
had
just
elapsed
,
the
marquis
had
felt
at
*NL*
times
impelled
by
a
caprice
for
making
Julien
rich
.
He
considered
*NL*
poverty
mean
,
humiliating
for
himself
,
M.
de
la
Mole
,
and
impossible
*NL*
in
his
daughter
's
husband
;
he
was
ready
to
lavish
money
.
On
the
next
*NL*
day
his
imagination
would
go
off
on
another
tack
,
and
he
would
think
*NL*
that
Julien
would
read
between
the
lines
of
this
financial
generosity
,
*NL*
change
his
name
,
exile
himself
to
America
,
and
write
to
Mathilde
that
*NL*
he
was
dead
for
her
.
M.
de
la
Mole
imagined
this
letter
written
,
and
*NL*
went
so
far
as
to
follow
its
effect
on
his
daughter
's
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
when
he
was
awakened
from
these
highly
youthful
dreams
by
*NL*
Mathilde
's
actual
letter
after
he
had
been
thinking
for
along
time
*NL*
of
killing
Julien
or
securing
his
disappearance
he
was
dreaming
of
*NL*
building
up
a
brilliant
position
for
him
.
He
would
make
him
take
the
*NL*
name
of
one
of
his
estates
,
and
why
should
he
not
make
him
inherit
a
*NL*
peerage
?
His
father-in-law
,
M.
the
duke
de
Chaulnes
,
had
,
since
the
*NL*
death
of
his
own
son
in
Spain
,
frequently
spoken
to
him
about
his
*NL*
desire
to
transmit
his
title
to
Norbert
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
can
not
help
owning
that
Julien
has
a
singular
aptitude
for
*NL*
affairs
,
had
boldness
,
and
is
possibly
even
brilliant
,
''
said
the
*NL*
marquis
to
himself
...
``
but
I
detect
at
the
root
of
his
character
a
*NL*
certain
element
which
alarms
me
.
He
produces
the
same
impression
upon
*NL*
everyone
,
consequently
there
must
be
something
real
in
it
,
''
and
the
*NL*
more
difficult
this
reality
was
to
seize
hold
of
,
the
more
it
alarmed
*NL*
the
imaginative
mind
of
the
old
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter
expressed
the
same
point
very
neatly
the
other
day
-LRB-
in
a
*NL*
suppressed
letter
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Julien
has
not
joined
any
salon
or
any
coterie
.
He
has
nothing
to
*NL*
support
himself
against
me
,
and
has
absolutely
no
resource
if
I
abandon
*NL*
him
.
Now
is
that
ignorance
of
the
actual
state
of
society
?
I
have
said
*NL*
to
him
two
or
three
times
,
the
only
real
and
profitable
candidature
is
*NL*
the
candidature
of
the
salons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
has
not
the
adroit
,
cunning
genius
of
an
attorney
who
never
*NL*
loses
a
minute
or
an
opportunity
.
He
is
very
far
from
being
a
character
*NL*
like
Louis
XL
.
On
the
other
hand
,
I
have
seen
him
quote
the
most
*NL*
ungenerous
maxims
...
it
is
beyond
me
.
Can
it
be
that
he
simply
repeats
*NL*
these
maxims
in
order
to
use
them
as
a
_
dam
_
against
his
passions
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
one
thing
comes
to
the
surface
;
he
can
not
bear
contempt
,
*NL*
that
's
my
hold
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
not
,
it
is
true
,
the
religious
reverence
for
high
birth
.
He
*NL*
does
not
instinctively
respect
us
...
That
is
wrong
;
but
after
all
,
*NL*
the
only
things
which
are
supposed
to
make
the
soul
of
a
seminary
*NL*
student
impatient
are
lack
of
enjoyment
and
lack
of
money
.
He
is
quite
*NL*
different
,
and
can
not
stand
contempt
at
any
price
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pressed
as
he
was
by
his
daughter
's
letter
,
M.
de
la
Mole
realised
the
*NL*
necessity
for
making
up
his
mind
.
``
After
all
,
the
great
question
is
*NL*
this
:
--
Did
Julien
's
audacity
go
to
the
point
of
setting
out
to
make
*NL*
advances
to
my
daughter
because
he
knows
I
love
her
more
than
anything
*NL*
else
in
the
world
,
and
because
I
have
an
income
of
a
hundred
thousand
*NL*
crowns
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
protests
to
the
contrary
...
``
No
,
monsieur
Julien
,
that
is
a
*NL*
point
on
which
I
am
not
going
to
be
under
any
illusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
really
a
case
of
spontaneous
and
authentic
love
?
or
is
it
just
*NL*
a
vulgar
desire
to
raise
himself
to
a
fine
position
?
Mathilde
is
*NL*
far-seeing
;
she
appreciated
from
the
first
that
this
suspicion
might
*NL*
ruin
him
with
me
--
hence
that
confession
of
hers
.
It
was
she
who
took
*NL*
upon
herself
to
love
him
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
idea
of
a
girl
of
so
proud
a
character
so
far
forgetting
herself
*NL*
as
to
make
physical
advances
!
To
think
of
pressing
his
arm
in
the
*NL*
garden
in
the
evening
!
How
horrible
!
As
though
there
were
not
a
hundred
*NL*
other
less
unseemly
ways
of
notifying
him
that
he
was
the
object
of
her

favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Qui
s
`
excuse
s
`
accuse
_
;
I
distrust
Mathilde
.
''
The
marquis
's
reasoning
*NL*
was
more
conclusive
to-day
than
it
was
usually
.
Nevertheless
,
force
*NL*
of
habit
prevailed
,
and
he
resolved
to
gain
time
by
writing
to
his
*NL*
daughter
,
for
a
correspondence
was
being
carried
on
between
one
wing
*NL*
of
the
hotel
and
the
other
.
M.
de
la
Mole
did
not
dare
to
discuss
*NL*
matters
with
Mathilde
and
to
see
her
face
to
face
.
He
was
frightened
of
*NL*
clinching
the
whole
matter
by
yielding
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
you
commit
no
new
acts
of
madness
;
here
is
*NL*
a
commission
of
lieutenant
of

the
*NL*
chevalier

Julien

You
see
what
I

am
doing
for
him

Do
not
irritate
me
.
Do
not
question
*NL*
me
.
Let
him
leave
within
twenty-four
hours
and
present
*NL*
himself
at
Strasbourg
where
his
regiment
is
.
Here
is
an
*NL*
order
on
my
banker
.
Obey
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
's
love
and
joy
were
unlimited
.
She
wished
to
profit
by
her
*NL*
victory
and
immediately
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
M.
de
la
Vernaye
knew
all
that
you
are
good
enough
*NL*
to
do
for
him
,
he
would
be
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
*NL*
and
be
at
your
feet
.
But
amidst
all
this
generosity
,
my
*NL*
father
has
forgotten
me
;
your
daughter
's
honour
is
in
*NL*
peril
.
An
indiscretion
may
produce
an
everlasting
blot
*NL*
which
an
income
of
twenty
thousand
crowns
could
not
*NL*
put
right
.
I
will
only
send
the
commission
to
M.
de
la
*NL*
Vernaye
if
you
give
me
your
word
that
my
marriage
will
*NL*
be
publicly
celebrated
at
Villequier
in
the
course
of
*NL*
next
month
.
Shortly
after
that
period
,
which
I
entreat
*NL*
you
not
to
prolong
,
your
daughter
will
only
be
able
to
*NL*
appear
in
public
under
the
name
of
Madame
de

Vernaye

*NL*
How
I
thank
you
,
dear
papa

for
having
saved
me
from
the
*NL*
name
of
Sorel
,

*NL*
*NL*
The
reply
was
unexpected
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Obey
or
I
retract
everything
.
Tremble
,
you
imprudent
*NL*
young
girl
.
I
do
not
yet
know
what
your
Julien
is
,
*NL*
and
you
yourself
know
less
than
I.
Let
him
leave
for
*NL*
Strasbourg
,
and
try
to
act
straightly
.
I
will
notify
him
*NL*
from
here
of
my
wishes
within
a
fortnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
was
astonished
by
this
firm
answer
.
_
I
do
not
know
Julien
_
.
*NL*
These
words
threw
her
into
a
reverie
which
soon
finished
in
the
most
*NL*
fascinating
suppositions
;
but
she
believed
in
their
truth
.
My
Julien
's
*NL*
intellect
is
not
clothed
in
the
petty
mean
uniform
of
the
salons
,
and
*NL*
my
father
refuses
to
believe
in
his
superiority
by
reason
of
the
very
*NL*
fact
which
proves
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
same
,
if
I
do
not
obey
this
whim
of
his
,
I
see
the
possibility
*NL*
of
a
public
scene
;
a
scandal
would
lower
my
position
in
society
,
and
*NL*
might
render
me
less
fascinating
in
Julien
's
eyes
.
After
the
scandal
*NL*
...
ten
years
of
poverty
;
and
the
only
thing
which
can
prevent
marrying
*NL*
for
merit
becoming
ridiculous
is
the
most
brilliant
wealth
.
If
I
live
*NL*
far
away
from
my
father
,
he
is
old
and
may
forget
me
...
Norbert
will
*NL*
marry
some
clever
,
charming
woman
;
old
Louis
XIV
.
was
seduced
by
the
*NL*
duchess
of
Burgundy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
decided
to
obey
,
but
refrained
from
communicating
her
father
's
*NL*
letter
to
Julien
.
It
might
perhaps
have
been
that
ferocious
character
*NL*
driven
to
some
act
of
madness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
joy
was
unlimited
when
she
informed
him
in
the
evening
that
*NL*
he
was
a
lieutenant
of
Hussars
.
Its
extent
can
be
imagined
from
the
*NL*
fact
that
this
had
constituted
the
ambition
of
his
whole
life
,
and
*NL*
also
from
the
passion
which
he
now
had
for
his
son
.
The
change
of
name
*NL*
struck
him
with
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
''
he
thought
,
``
I
have
got
to
the
end
of
my
romance
,
and
I
*NL*
deserve
all
the
credit
.
I
have
managed
to
win
the
love
of
that
monster
*NL*
of
pride
,
''
he
added
,
looking
at
Mathilde
.
``
Her
father
can
not
live
*NL*
without
her
,
nor
she
without
me

CHAPTER
LXV
*NL*
*NL*
A
STORM
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
God
,
give
me
mediocrity
.
--
_
Mirabeau
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
was
engrossed
;
he
only
half
answered
the
eager
tenderness
that
*NL*
she
showed
to
him
.
He
remained
gloomy
and
taciturn
.
He
had
never
seemed
*NL*
so
great
and
so
adorable
in
Mathilde
's
eyes
.
She
was
apprehensive
of
*NL*
some
subtle
twist
of
his
pride
which
would
spoil
the
whole
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
the
abbe
Pirard
come
to
the
hotel
nearly
every
morning
.
Might
*NL*
not
Julien
have
divined
something
of
her
father
's
intentions
through
*NL*
him
?
Might
not
the
marquis
himself
have
written
to
him
in
a
momentary
*NL*
caprice
.
What
was
the
explanation
of
Julien
's
stern
manner
following
on
*NL*
so
great
a
happiness
?
She
did
not
dare
to
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
_
dare
_
--
she
--
Mathilde
!
From
that
moment
her
feelings
for
*NL*
Julien
contained
a
certain
vague
and
unexpected
element
which
was
*NL*
almost
panic
.
This
arid
soul
experienced
all
the
passion
possible
in
*NL*
an
individual
who
has
been
brought
up
amid
that
excessive
civilisation
*NL*
which
Paris
so
much
admires
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
on
the
following
day
Julien
was
at
the
house
of
the
abbe
Pirard
.
*NL*
Some
post-horses
were
arriving
in
the
courtyard
with
a
dilapidated
*NL*
chaise
which
had
been
hired
at
a
neighbouring
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
vehicle
like
that
is
out
of
fashion
,
''
said
the
stern
abbe
to
him
*NL*
morosely
.
``
Here
are
twenty
thousand
francs
which
M.
de
la
Mole
makes
*NL*
you
a
gift
of
.
He
insists
on
your
spending
them
within
a
year
,
but
*NL*
at
the
same
time
wants
you
to
try
to
look
as
little
ridiculous
as
*NL*
possible
.
''
-LRB-
The
priest
regarded
flinging
away
so
substantial
a
sum
on
a
*NL*
young
man
as
simply
an
opportunity
for
sin
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
marquis
adds
this
:
'M
.
Julien
de
la
Vernaye
will
have
received
*NL*
this
money
from
his
father
,
whom
it
is
needless
to
call
by
any
other
*NL*
name
.
M.
de
la
Vernaye
will
perhaps
think
it
proper
to
give
a
present
*NL*
to
M.
Sorel
,
a
carpenter
of
Verrieres
,
who
cared
for
him
in
his
*NL*
childhood
...
'
I
can
undertake
that
commission
,
''
added
the
abbe
.
``
I
*NL*
have
at
last
prevailed
upon
M.
de
la
Mole
to
come
to
a
settlement
with
*NL*
that
Jesuit
,
the
abbe
de
Frilair
.
His
influence
is
unquestionably
too
*NL*
much
for
us
.
The
complete
recognition
of
your
high
birth
on
the
part
*NL*
of
this
man
,
who
is
in
fact
the
governor
of
B
--
will
be
one
of
the
*NL*
unwritten
terms
of
the
arrangement
.
''
Julien
could
no
longer
control
his
*NL*
ecstasy
.
He
embraced
the
abbe
.
He
saw
himself
recognised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
shame
,
''
said
M.
Pirard
,
pushing
him
away
.
``
What
is
the
meaning
of
*NL*
this
worldly
vanity
?
As
for
Sorel
and
his
sons
,
I
will
offer
them
in
my
*NL*
own
name
a
yearly
allowance
of
five
hundred
francs
,
which
will
be
paid
*NL*
to
each
of
them
as
long
as
I
am
satisfied
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
already
cold
and
haughty
.
He
expressed
his
thanks
,
but
in
*NL*
the
vaguest
terms
which
bound
him
to
nothing
.
``
Could
it
be
possible
,
''
*NL*
he
said
to
himself
,
``
that
I
am
the
natural
son
of
some
great
nobleman
*NL*
who
was
exiled
to
our
mountains
by
the
terrible
Napoleon
?
''
This
idea
*NL*
seemed
less
and
less
improbable
every
minute
...
``
My
hatred
of
my
*NL*
father
would
be
a
proof
of
this
...
In
that
case
,
I
should
not
be
an
*NL*
unnatural
monster
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
after
this
soliloquy
the
Fifteenth
Regiment
of
Hussars
,
*NL*
which
was
one
of
the
most
brilliant
in
the
army
,
was
being
reviewed
on
*NL*
the
parade
ground
of
Strasbourg
.
M.
the
chevalier
de
La
Vernaye
sat
*NL*
the
finest
horse
in
Alsace
,
which
had
cost
him
six
thousand
francs
.
He
*NL*
was
received
as
a
lieutenant
,
though
he
had
never
been
sub-lieutenant
*NL*
except
on
the
rolls
of
a
regiment
of
which
he
had
never
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
impassive
manner
,
his
stern
and
almost
malicious
eyes
,
his
pallor
,
*NL*
and
his
invariable
self-possession
,
founded
his
reputation
from
*NL*
the
very
first
day
.
Shortly
afterwards
his
perfect
and
calculated
*NL*
politeness
,
and
his
skill
at
shooting
and
fencing
,
of
which
,
though
*NL*
without
any
undue
ostentation
,
he
made
his
comrades
aware
,
did
away
*NL*
with
all
idea
of
making
fun
of
him
openly
.
After
hesitating
for
five
*NL*
or
six
days
,
the
public
opinion
of
the
regiment
declared
itself
in
his
*NL*
favour

``

Julien
wrote
from
Strasbourg
to
the
old
cure
of
Verrieres
,
M.
Chelan
,
*NL*
who
was
now
verging
on
extreme
old
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
have
learnt
,
with
a
joy
of
which
I
have
no
doubt
,
of
the
*NL*
events
which
have
induced
my
family
to
enrich
me
.
Here
are
five
hundred
*NL*
francs
which
I
request
you
to
distribute
quietly
,
and
without
any
*NL*
mention
of
my
name
,
among
those
unfortunate
ones
who
are
now
poor
as
I
*NL*
myself
was
once
,
and
whom
you
will
doubtless
help
as
you
once
helped
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
intoxicated
with
ambition
,
and
not
with
vanity
.
He
*NL*
nevertheless
devoted
a
great
part
of
his
time
to
attending
to
his
*NL*
external
appearance
.
His
horses
,
his
uniform
,
his
orderlies
'
liveries
,
*NL*
were
all
kept
with
a
correctness
which
would
have
done
credit
to
the
*NL*
punctiliousness
of
a
great
English
nobleman
.
He
had
scarcely
been
made
*NL*
a
lieutenant
as
a
matter
of
favour
-LRB-
and
that
only
two
days
ago
-RRB-
than
*NL*
he
began
to
calculate
that
if
he
was
to
become
commander-in-chief
*NL*
at
thirty
,
like
all
the
great
generals
,
then
he
must
be
more
than
a
*NL*
lieutenant
at
twenty-three
at
the
latest
.
He
thought
about
nothing
*NL*
except
fame
and
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
midst
of
the
ecstasies
of
the
most
reinless
ambition
that
*NL*
he
was
surprised
by
the
arrival
of
a
young
valet
from
the
Hotel
de
la
*NL*
Mole
,
who
had
come
with
a
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
lost
,
''
wrote
Mathilde
to
him
:
``
Rush
here
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
,
sacrifice
everything
,
desert
if
necessary
.
As
soon
as
you

have
arrived
,
wait
for
me
in
a
fiacre
near
the
little
garden
door
,
*NL*
near
No

--
of
the
street

I
will
come
and
speak
to
you
:
I
shall
*NL*
perhaps
be
able
to
introduce
you
into
the
garden
.
All
is
lost
,
and
I
am
*NL*
afraid
there
is
no
way
out
;
count
on
me
;
you
will
find
me
staunch
and
*NL*
firm
in
adversity
.
I
love
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
afterwards
,
Julien
obtained
a
furlough
from
the
colonel
,
*NL*
and
left
Strasbourg
at
full
gallop
.
But
the
awful
anxiety
which
*NL*
devoured
him
did
not
allow
him
to
continue
this
method
of
travel
beyond
*NL*
Metz
.
He
flung
himself
into
a
post-chaise
,
and
arrived
with
an
almost
*NL*
incredible
rapidity
at
the
indicated
spot
,
near
the
little
garden
door
*NL*
of
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
.
The
door
opened
,
and
Mathilde
,
oblivious
of
*NL*
all
human
conventions
,
rushed
into
his
arms
.
Fortunately
,
it
was
only
*NL*
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
the
street
was
still
deserted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
lost

My
father
,
fearing
my
tears

left
Thursday
night

where
for

But
here
is
his
letter
:
read
it

She
climbed
into
the
*NL*
fiacre
with
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
forgive
everything

the
plan
of
seducing
you
because
*NL*
you
are
rich

That

unhappy

,
is
the
awful
truth
.
I
give
you
my
*NL*
word
of
honour
that
I
will
never
consent
to
a
marriage
with
that
man
.
*NL*
I
will
guarantee
him
an
income
of
10,000
francs
if
he
will
live
far
*NL*
away
beyond
the
French
frontiers
,
or
better
still
,
in
America

Read
the
*NL*
letter
which
I
have
just
received
in
answer
to
the
enquiries
which
I
*NL*
have
made

The
impudent
scoundrel
had
himself
requested
me
to
write
to
*NL*
madame
de
Renal

I
will
never
read
a
single

I
feel
a
horror
for
both
Paris

yourself

I
urge
you

cover
what
is
bound

happen

utmost
secrecy

nothing

Julien
coldly

LETTER
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
duties
to
the
sacred
cause
of
religion
and
morality
,
*NL*
oblige
me
,
monsieur
,
to
take
the
painful
course
which
I
*NL*
have
just
done
with
regard
to
yourself
:
an
infallible
*NL*
principle
orders
me
to
do
harm
to
my
neighbour
at
the
*NL*
present
moment
,
but
only
in
order
to
avoid
an
even
*NL*
greater
scandal
.
My
sentiment
of
duty
must
overcome
*NL*
the
pain
which
I
experience
.
It
is
only
too
true
,
*NL*
monsieur
,
that
the
conduct
of
the
person
about
whom
you
*NL*
ask
me
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
may
seem
incredible
*NL*
or
even
honest
.
It
may
possibly
be
considered
proper
*NL*
to
hide
or
to
disguise
part
of
the
truth
:
that
would
*NL*
be
in
accordance
with
both
prudence
and
religion
.
But
*NL*
the
conduct
about
which
you
desire
information
has
*NL*
been
in
fact
reprehensible
to
the
last
degree
,
and
*NL*
more
than
I
can
say
.
Poor
and
greedy
as
the
man
is
,
it
*NL*
is
only
by
the
aid
of
the
most
consummate
hypocrisy
,
*NL*
and
by
seducing
a
weak
and
unhappy
woman
,
that
he
has
*NL*
endeavoured
to
make
a
career
for
himself
and
become
*NL*
someone
in
the
world
.
It
is
part
of
my
painful
duty
to
*NL*
add
that
I
am
obliged
to
believe
that
M.
Julien
has
no
*NL*
religious
principles
.
I
am
driven
conscientiously
to
*NL*
think
that
one
of
his
methods
of
obtaining
success
in
*NL*
any
household
is
to
try
to
seduce
the
woman
who
commands
*NL*
the
principal
influence
.
His
one
great
object
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
his
show
of
disinterestedness
,
and
his
stock-in-trade
*NL*
of
phrases
out
of
novels
,
is
to
succeed
in
doing
what
he
*NL*
likes
with
the
master
of
the
household
and
his
fortune
.
*NL*
He
leaves
behind
him
unhappiness
and
eternal
remorse
,
*NL*
etc.
,
etc.
,
etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
extremely
long
letter
,
which
was
almost
blotted
out
by
tears
,
was
*NL*
certainly
in
madame
de
Renal
's
handwriting
;
it
was
even
written
with
*NL*
more
than
ordinary
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
blame
M.

Julien
,
``
after

had
finished
it

prudent

What
father
would
give
his
beloved
daughter
to

such
a
man

''
Julien
jumped
out
of
the
fiacre
and
rushed
to
his
*NL*
post-chaise
,
which
had
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
street
.
Mathilde
,
whom
*NL*
he
had
apparently
forgotten
,
took
a
few
steps
as
though
to
follow
him
,
*NL*
but
the
looks
she
received
from
the
tradesmen
,
who
were
coming
out
on
*NL*
the
thresholds
of
their
shops
,
and
who
knew
who
she
was
,
forced
her
to
*NL*
return
precipitately
to
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
left
for
Verrieres
.
During
that
rapid
journey
he
was
unable
*NL*
to
write
to
Mathilde
as
he
had
intended
.
His
hand
could
only
form
*NL*
illegible
characters
on
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
arrived
at
Verrieres
on
a
Sunday
morning
.
He
entered
the
shop
of
the
*NL*
local
gunsmith
,
who
overwhelmed
him
with
congratulations
on
his
recent
*NL*
good
fortune
.
It
constituted
the
news
of
the
locality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
much
difficulty
in
making
him
understand
that
he
wanted
a
*NL*
pair
of
pistols
.
At
his
request
the
gunsmith
loaded
the
pistols
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
peals
sounded
;
it
is
a
well-known
signal
in
the
villages
of
*NL*
France
,
and
after
the
various
ringings
in
the
morning
announces
the
*NL*
immediate
commencement
of
Mass.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
entered
the
new
church
of
Verrieres
.
All
the
lofty
windows
of
*NL*
the
building
were
veiled
with
crimson
curtains
.
Julien
found
himself
*NL*
some
spaces
behind
the
pew
of
madame
de
Renal
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
she
was
praying
fervently
The
sight
of
the
woman
whom
he
had
loved
so
*NL*
much
made
Julien
's
arm
tremble
so
violently
that
he
was
at
first
unable
*NL*
to
execute
his
project
.
``
I
can
not
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
It
is
a
*NL*
physical
impossibility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
young
priest
,
who
was
officiating
at
the
Mass
,
rang
*NL*
the
bell
for
the
elevation
of
the
host
.
Madame
de
Renal
lowered
her
*NL*
head
,
which
,
for
a
moment
became
entirely
hidden
by
the
folds
of
her
*NL*
shawl
.
Julien
did
not
see
her
features
so
distinctly
:
he
aimed
a
pistol
*NL*
shot
at
her
,
and
missed
her
:
he
aimed
a
second
shot
,
she
fell
.

Julien
remained
motionless
.
He
saw
nothing
more
.
When
he
recovered
*NL*
himself
a
little
he
noticed
all
the
faithful
rushing
from
the
church
.
*NL*
The
priest
had
left
the
altar
.
Julien
started
fairly
slowly
to
follow
*NL*
some
women
who
were
going
away
with
loud
screams
.
A
woman
who
was
*NL*
trying
to
get
away
more
quickly
than
the
others
,
pushed
him
roughly
.
He
*NL*
fell
.
His
feet
got
entangled
with
a
chair
,
knocked
over
by
the
crowd
;
*NL*
when
he
got
up
,
he
felt
his
neck
gripped
.
A
gendarme
,
in
full
uniform
,
*NL*
was
arresting
him
.
Julien
tried
mechanically
to
have
recourse
to
his
*NL*
little
pistol
;
but
a
second
gendarme
pinioned
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
taken
to
the
prison
.
They
went
into
a
room
where
irons
were
put
*NL*
on
his
hands
.
He
was
left
alone
.
The
door
was
doubly
locked
on
him
.
All
*NL*
this
was
done
very
quickly
,
and
he
scarcely
appreciated
it
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
upon
my
word
,
all
is
over
,
''
he
said
aloud
as
he
recovered
*NL*
himself
.
``
Yes
,
the
guillotine
in
a
fortnight
...
or
killing
myself
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
reasoning
did
not
go
any
further
.
His
head
felt
as
though
it
had
*NL*
been
seized
in
some
violent
grip
.
He
looked
round
to
see
if
anyone
was
*NL*
holding
him
.
After
some
moments
he
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
not
mortally
wounded
.
The
first
bullet
had
pierced
*NL*
her
hat
.
The
second
had
been
fired
as
she
was
turning
round
.
The
*NL*
bullet
had
struck
her
on
the
shoulder
,
and
,
astonishing
to
relate
,
*NL*
had
ricocheted
from
off
the
shoulder
bone
-LRB-
which
it
had
,
however
,
*NL*
broken
-RRB-
against
a
gothic
pillar
,
from
which
it
had
loosened
an
enormous
*NL*
splinter
of
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
after
a
long
and
painful
bandaging
,
the
solemn
surgeon
said
to
*NL*
madame
de
Renal
,
``
I
answer
for
your
life
as
I
would
for
my
own
,
''
she
*NL*
was
profoundly
grieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
sincerely
desirous
of
death
for
a
long
time
.
The
letter
*NL*
which
she
had
written
to
M.
de
la
Mole
in
accordance
with
the
*NL*
injunctions
of
her
present
confessor
,
had
proved
the
final
blow
to
a
*NL*
creature
already
weakened
by
an
only
too
permanent
unhappiness
.
This
*NL*
unhappiness
was
caused
by
Julien
's
absence
;
but
she
,
for
her
own
part
,
*NL*
called
it
remorse
.
Her
director
,
a
young
ecclesiastic
,
who
was
both
*NL*
virtuous
and
enthusiastic
,
and
had
recently
come
to
Dijon
,
made
no
*NL*
mistake
as
to
its
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dying
in
this
way
,
though
not
by
my
own
hand
,
is
very
far
from
being
*NL*
a
sin
,
''
thought
madame
de
Renal
.
``
God
will
perhaps
forgive
me
for
*NL*
rejoicing
over
my
death
.
''
She
did
not
dare
to
add
,
``
and
dying
by
*NL*
Julien
's
hand
puts
the
last
touch
on
my
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
scarcely
been
rid
of
the
presence
of
the
surgeon
and
of
all
the
*NL*
crowd
of
friends
that
had
rushed
to
see
her
,
than
she
called
her
maid
,
*NL*
Elisa
.
``
The
gaoler
,
''
she
said
to
her
with
a
violent
blush
,
``
is
a
cruel
*NL*
man
.
He
will
doubtless
ill-treat
him
,
thinking
to
please
me
by
doing
*NL*
so
...
I
can
not
bear
that
idea
.
Could
you
not
go
,
as
though
on
your
own
*NL*
account
,
and
give
the
gaoler
this
little
packet
which
contains
some
*NL*
louis
.
You
will
tell
him
that
religion
forbids
him
to
treat
him
badly
,
*NL*
above
all
,
he
must
not
go
and
speak
about
the
sending
of
this
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
circumstance
,
which
we
have
just
mentioned
,
that
Julien
had
*NL*
to
thank
for
the
humanity
of
the
gaoler
of
Verrieres
.
It
was
still
the
*NL*
same
M.
Noiraud
,
that
ideal
official
,
whom
he
remembered
as
being
so
*NL*
finely
alarmed
by
M.
Appert
's
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
judge
appeared
in
the
prison
.
``
I
occasioned
death
by
premeditation
,
''
*NL*
said
Julien
to
him
.
``
I
bought
the
pistols
and
had
them
loaded
at
*NL*
so-and-so
's
,
a
gunsmith
.
Article
1342
of
the
penal
code
is
clear
.
I
*NL*
deserve
death
,
and
I
expect
it
.
''
Astonished
at
this
kind
of
answer
,
the
*NL*
judge
started
to
multiply
his
questions
,
with
a
view
of
the
accused
*NL*
contradicting
himself
in
his
answers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't

Julien

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

he
said
to
her

``
Unfortunately

I
shall
not

from

My
revenge
was
ghastly

pain
of
being
separated
from

From
this
moment
I
*NL*
forbid
myself
to

Never
*NL*
speak
of
me
even

silence
is
the
only
way

honouring

To

Allow
me
the
luxury
of
the

This

great
catastrophe
of
which
I
advise
you
not
to
say
a

single
word

that
romantic

You

Let

You

It
was
only
after
he
had
despatched
this
letter
and
had
recovered
*NL*
himself
a
little
,
that
Julien
felt
for
the
first
time
extremely
*NL*
unhappy
.
Those
momentous
words
,
I
shall
die
,
meant
the
successive
*NL*
tearing
out
of
his
heart
of
each
individual
hope
and
ambition
.
*NL*
Death
,
in
itself
,
was
not
horrible
in
his
eyes
.
His
whole
life
had
*NL*
been
nothing
but
a
long
preparation
for
unhappiness
,
and
he
had
*NL*
made
a
point
of
not
losing
sight
of
what
is
considered
the
greatest
*NL*
unhappiness
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
then
,
''
he
said
to
himself
;
``
if
I
had
to
fight
a
duel
in
a
couple
*NL*
of
months
,
with
an
expert
duellist

should
I
be
weak
enough
to
think
*NL*
about
it
incessantly
with
panic
in
my
soul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
more
than
an
hour
in
trying
to
analyze
himself
thoroughly
on
*NL*
this
score
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
saw
clear
in
his
own
soul
,
and
the
truth
appeared
before
his
*NL*
eyes
with
as
much
definiteness
as
one
of
the
pillars
of
his
prison
,
he
*NL*
thought
about
remorse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
have
any
?
I
have
been
atrociously
injured
;
I
have
*NL*
killed
--
I
deserve
death
,
but
that
is
all
.
I
die
after
having
squared
my
*NL*
account
with
humanity
.
I
do
not
leave
any
obligation
unfulfilled
.
I
owe
*NL*
nothing
to
anybody
;
there
is
nothing
shameful
about
my
death
,
except
*NL*
the
instrument
of
it
;
that
alone
,
it
is
true
,
is
simply
sufficient
to
*NL*
disgrace
me
in
the
eyes
of
the
bourgeois
of
Verrieres
;
but
from
the
*NL*
intellectual
standpoint
,
what
could
be
more
contemptible
than
they
?
I
*NL*
have
one
means
of
winning
their
consideration
;
by
flinging
pieces
of
*NL*
gold
to
the
people
as
I
go
to
the
scaffold
.
If
my
memory
is
linked
with
*NL*
the
idea
of
gold
,
they
will
always
look
upon
it
as
resplendent

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
chain
of
reasoning
,
which
after
a
minute
's
reflection
seemed
*NL*
to
him
self-evident
,
Julien
said
to
himself
,
``
I
have
nothing
left
to
do
*NL*
in
the
world
,
''
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
9
o'clock
in
the
evening
the
gaoler
woke
him
up
as
he
brought
in
*NL*
his
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
they
saying
in

*NL*
``

Courtyard

on
the
day
when
I
was
installed
in
my
place
,

me
to
*NL*
silence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
,
but
remained
.
Julien
was
amused
by
the
sight
of
this
*NL*
vulgar
hypocrisy
.
I
must
make
him
,
he
thought
,
wait
a
long
time
for
the
*NL*
five
francs
which
he
wants
to
sell
his
conscience
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
gaoler
saw
him
finish
his
meal
without
making
any
attempt
to
*NL*
corrupt
him
,
he
said
in
a
soft
and
perfidious
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
affection
which
I
have
for
you
,
M.

,
compels
me
to
speak

*NL*
Although
they
say
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
interests
of
justice
,
*NL*
because
it
may
assist
you
in
preparing
your
defence
.
M.
Julien
you
are
*NL*
a
good
fellow
at
heart
,
and
you
will
be
very
glad
to
learn
that
madame
*NL*
de
Renal
is
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
she
is
not
dead
?
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
beside
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
know
nothing
?
''
said
the
gaoler
,
with
a
stupid
air
which
soon
*NL*
turned
into
exultant
cupidity
.
``
It
would
be
very
proper
,
monsieur
,
for
*NL*
you
to
give
something
to
the
surgeon
,
who
,
so
far
as
law
and
justice
*NL*
go
,
ought
not
to
have
spoken
.
But
in
order
to
please
you
,
monsieur
,
I
*NL*
went
to
him
,
and
he
told
me
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyway
,
the
wound
is
not
mortal
,
''
said
Julien
to
him
impatiently
,
``
you
*NL*
answer
for
it
on
your
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gaoler
,
who
was
a
giant
six
feet
tall
,
was
frightened
and
retired
*NL*
towards
the
door
.
Julien
saw
that
he
was
adopting
bad
tactics
for
*NL*
getting
at
the
truth
.
He
sat
down
again
and
flung
a
napoleon
to
M.
*NL*
Noiraud
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
man
's
story
proved
to
Julien
more
and
more
conclusively
that
*NL*
madame
de
Renal
's
wound
was
not
mortal
,
he
felt
himself
overcome
by
*NL*
tears
.
``
Leave
me
,
''
he
said
brusquely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gaoler
obeyed
.
Scarcely
had
the
door
shut
,
than
Julien
exclaimed
:
*NL*
``
Great
God
,
she
is
not
dead
,
''
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
,
shedding
hot
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
supreme
moment
he
was
a
believer
.
What
mattered
the
hypocrisies
*NL*
of
the
priests
?
Could
they
abate
one
whit
of
the
truth
and
sublimity
of
*NL*
the
idea
of
God
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
then
that
Julien
began
to
repent
of
the
crime
that
he
had
*NL*
committed
.
By
a
coincidence
,
which
prevented
him
falling
into
despair
,
*NL*
it
was
only
at
the
present
moment
that
the
condition
of
physical
*NL*
irritation
and
semi-madness
,
in
which
he
had
been
plunged
since
his
*NL*
departure
from
Paris
for
Verrieres
came
to
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
tears
had
a
generous
source
.
He
had
no
doubt
about
the
condemnation
*NL*
which
awaited
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
will
live
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
She
will
live
to
forgive
me
*NL*
and
love
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Very
late
the
next
morning
the
gaoler
woke
him
up
and
said
,
``
You
must
*NL*
have
a
famous
spirit
,
M.
Julien
.
I
have
come
in
twice
,
but
I
did
not
*NL*
want
to
wake
you
up
.
Here
are
two
bottles
of
excellent
wine
which
our
*NL*
cure
,
M.
Maslon
,
has
sent
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
is
that
scoundrel
still
here
?
''
said
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
gaoler
,
lowering
his
voice
.
``
But
do
not
talk
*NL*
so
loud
,
it
may
do
you
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
laughed
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
stage
I
have
reached
,
my
friend
,
you
alone
can
do
me
harm
in
*NL*
the
event
of
your
ceasing
to
be
kind
and
tender
.
You
will
be
well
*NL*
paid
,
''
said
Julien
,
changing
his
tone
and
reverting
to
his
imperious
*NL*
manner
.
This
manner
was
immediately
justified
by
the
gift
of
a
piece
of
*NL*
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Noiraud
related
again
,
with
the
greatest
detail
,
everything
he
*NL*
had
learnt
about
madame
de
Renal
,
but
he
did
not
make
any
mention
of
*NL*
mademoiselle
Elisa
's
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
was
as
base
and
servile
as
it
was
possible
to
be
.
An
idea
*NL*
crossed
Julien
's
mind
.
``
This
kind
of
misshapen
giant
can
not
earn
more
*NL*
than
three
or
four
hundred
francs
,
for
his
prison
is
not
at
all
full
.
*NL*
I
can
guarantee
him
ten
thousand
francs
,
if
he
will
escape
with
me
*NL*
to
Switzerland
.
The
difficulty
will
be
in
persuading
him
of
my
good
*NL*
faith
.
''
The
idea
of
the
long
conversation
he
would
need
to
have
with
so
*NL*
vile
a
person
filled
Julien
with
disgust
.
He
thought
of
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
the
time
had
passed
.
A
post-chaise
had
come
to
pick
him
*NL*
up
at
midnight
.
He
was
very
pleased
with
his
travelling
companions
,
the
*NL*
gendarmes
.
When
he
arrived
at
the
prison
of
Besancon
in
the
morning
*NL*
they
were
kind
enough
to
place
him
in
the
upper
storey
of
a
Gothic
*NL*
turret
.
He
judged
the
architecture
to
be
of
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
fourteenth
century
.
He
admired
its
fascinating
grace
and
lightness
.
*NL*
Through
a
narrow
space
between
two
walls
,
beyond
the
deep
court
,
there
*NL*
opened
a
superb
vista
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
there
was
an
interrogation
,
after
which
he
was
*NL*
left
in
peace
for
several
days
.
His
soul
was
calm
.
He
found
his
affair
*NL*
a
perfectly
simple
one
.
``
I
meant
to
kill
.
I
deserve
to
be
killed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
thoughts
did
not
linger
any
further
over
this
line
of
reasoning
.
*NL*
As
for
the
sentence
,
the
disagreeableness
of
appearing
in
public
,
*NL*
the
defence
,
he
considered
all
this
as
slight
embarrassment
,
irksome
*NL*
formalities
,
which
it
would
be
time
enough
to
consider
on
the
actual
*NL*
day
.
The
actual
moment
of
death
did
not
seize
hold
of
his
mind
either
.
*NL*
``
I
will
think
about
it
after
the
sentence
.
''
Life
was
no
longer
boring
,
*NL*
he
was
envisaging
everything
from
a
new
point
of
view
,
he
had
no
longer
*NL*
any
ambition
.
He
rarely
thought
about
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
His
*NL*
passion
of
remorse
engrossed
him
a
great
deal
,
and
often
conjured
up
*NL*
the
image
of
madame
de
Renal
,
particularly
during
the
silence
of
the
*NL*
night
,
which
in
this
high
turret
was
only
disturbed
by
the
song
of
the
*NL*
osprey
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thanked
heaven
that
he
had
not
inflicted
a
mortal
wound
.
*NL*
``
Astonishing
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
thought
that
she
had
destroyed
my
*NL*
future
happiness
for
ever
by
her
letter
to
M.
de
la
Mole
,
and
here
am
*NL*
I
,
less
than
a
fortnight
after
the
date
of
that
letter
,
not
giving
a
*NL*
single
thought
to
all
the
things
that
engrossed
me
then
.
An
income
of
*NL*
two
or
three
thousand
francs
,
on
which
to
live
quietly
in
a
mountain
*NL*
district
,
like
Vergy
...
I
was
happy
then
...
I
did
not
realise
my
*NL*
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
other
moments
he
would
jump
up
from
his
chair
.
``
If
I
had
mortally
*NL*
wounded
madame
de
Renal
,
I
would
have
killed
myself
...
I
need
to
feel
*NL*
certain
of
that
so
as
not
to
horrify
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kill
myself
?
That
's
the
great
question
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
those
judges
,
those
fiends
of
red
tape
,
who
would
hang
their
best
*NL*
citizen
in
order
to
win
the
cross
...
At
any
rate
,
I
should
escape
from
*NL*
their
control
and
from
the
bad
French
of
their
insults
,
which
the
local
*NL*
paper
will
call
eloquence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
still
have
five
or
six
weeks
,
more
or
less
to
live
...
Kill
myself
.
*NL*
No
,
not
for
a
minute
,
''
he
said
to
himself
after
some
days
,
``
Napoleon
*NL*
went
on
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
I
find
life
pleasant
,
this
place
is
quiet
,
I
am
not
troubled
*NL*
with
bores
,
''
he
added
with
a
smile
,
and
he
began
to
make
out
a
list
of
*NL*
the
books
which
he
wanted
to
order
from
Paris

*NL*
*NL*
A
TURRET
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
tomb
of
a
friend
.
--
_
Sterne
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
a
loud
noise
in
the
corridor
.
It
was
not
the
time
when
the
*NL*
gaoler
usually
came
up
to
his
prison
.
The
osprey
flew
away
with
a
*NL*
shriek
.
The
door
opened
,
and
the
venerable
cure
Chelan
threw
himself
*NL*
into
his
arms
.
He
was
trembling
all
over
and
had
his
stick
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
God
!
Is
it
possible
,
my
child
--
I
ought
to
say
monster
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
old
man
could
not
add
a
single
word
.
Julien
was
afraid
he
*NL*
would
fall
down
.
He
was
obliged
to
lead
him
to
a
chair
.
The
hand
of
*NL*
time
lay
heavy
on
this
man
who
had
once
been
so
active
.
He
seemed
to
*NL*
Julien
the
mere
shadow
of
his
former
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
regained
his
breath
,
he
said
,
``
It
was
only
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
that
I
received
your
letter
from
Strasbourg
with
your
five
*NL*
hundred
francs
for
the
poor
of
Verrieres
.
They
brought
it
to
me
in
*NL*
the
mountains
at
Liveru
where
I
am
living
in
retirement
with
my
*NL*
nephew
Jean
.
Yesterday
I
learnt
of
the
catastrophe
...
Heavens
,
is
it
*NL*
possible
?
''
And
the
old
man
left
off
weeping
.
He
did
not
seem
to
have
*NL*
any
ideas
left
,
but
added
mechanically
,
``
You
will
have
need
of
your
*NL*
five
hundred
francs
,
I
will
bring
them
back
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
to
see
you
,
my
father
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
really
touched
.
``
I
*NL*
have
money
,
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
could
not
obtain
any
coherent
answer
.
From
time
to
time
,
M.
*NL*
Chelan
shed
some
tears
which
coursed
silently
down
his
cheeks
.
He
then
*NL*
looked
at
Julien
,
and
was
quite
dazed
when
he
saw
him
kiss
his
hands
*NL*
and
carry
them
to
his
lips
.
That
face
which
had
once
been
so
vivid
,
*NL*
and
which
had
once
portrayed
with
such
vigour
the
most
noble
emotions
*NL*
was
now
sunk
in
a
perpetual
apathy
.
A
kind
of
peasant
came
soon
to
*NL*
fetch
the
old
man
.
``
You
must
not
fatigue
him
,
''
he
said
to
Julien
,
who
*NL*
understood
that
he
was
the
nephew
.
This
visit
left
Julien
plunged
in
a
*NL*
cruel
unhappiness
which
found
no
vent
in
tears
.
Everything
seemed
to
*NL*
him
gloomy
and
disconsolate
.
He
felt
his
heart
frozen
in
his
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
moment
was
the
cruellest
which
he
had
experienced
since
the
*NL*
crime
.
He
had
just
seen
death
and
seen
it
in
all
its
ugliness
.
All
his
*NL*
illusions
about
greatness
of
soul
and
nobility
of
character
had
been
*NL*
dissipated
like
a
cloud
before
the
hurricane
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
awful
plight
lasted
several
hours
.
After
moral
poisoning
,
physical
*NL*
remedies
and
champagne
are
necessary
.
Julien
would
have
considered
*NL*
himself
a
coward
to
have
resorted
to
them
.
``
What
a
fool
I
am
,
''
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
towards
the
end
of
the
horrible
day
that
he
had
spent
*NL*
entirely
in
walking
up
and
down
his
narrow
turret
.
``
It
's
only
,
if
I
*NL*
had
been
going
to
die
like
anybody
else
,
that
the
sight
of
that
poor
*NL*
old
man
would
have
had
any
right
to
have
thrown
me
into
this
awful
fit
*NL*
of
sadness
:
but
a
rapid
death
in
the
flower
of
my
age
simply
puts
me
*NL*
beyond
the
reach
of
such
awful
senility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
his
argumentation
,
Julien
felt
as
touched
as
any
*NL*
weak-minded
person
would
have
been
,
and
consequently
felt
unhappy
*NL*
as
the
result
of
the
visit
.
He
no
longer
had
any
element
of
rugged
*NL*
greatness
,
or
any
Roman
virtue
.
Death
appeared
to
him
at
a
great
height
*NL*
and
seemed
a
less
easy
proposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
I
shall
take
for
my
thermometer
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
``
To-night
I
am
ten
degrees
below
the
courage
requisite
for
*NL*
guillotine-point
level
.
I
had
that
courage
this
morning
.
Anyway
,
what
*NL*
does
it
matter
so
long
as
it
comes
back
to
me
at
the
necessary
moment
?
''
*NL*
This
thermometer
idea
amused
him
and
finally
managed
to
distract
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
woke
up
the
next
day
he
was
ashamed
of
the
previous
day
.
``
My
*NL*
happiness
and
peace
of
mind
are
at
stake
.
''
He
almost
made
up
his
mind
*NL*
to
write
to
the
Procureur-General
to
request
that
no
one
should
be
*NL*
admitted
to
see
him
.
``
And
how
about
Fouque
,
''
he
thought
?
``
If
he
takes
*NL*
it
upon
himself
to
come
to
Besancon
,
his
grief
will
be
immense
.
''
*NL*
It
had
perhaps
been
two
months
since
he
had
given
Fouque
a
thought
.
*NL*
``
I
was
a
great
fool
at
Strasbourg
.
My
thoughts
did
not
go
beyond
my
*NL*
coat-collar
.
He
was
much
engrossed
by
the
memory
of
Fouque
,
which
*NL*
left
him
more
and
more
touched
.
He
walked
nervously
about
.
Here
I
*NL*
am
,
clearly
twenty
degrees
below
death
point
...
If
this
weakness
*NL*
increases
,
it
will
be
better
for
me
to
kill
myself
.
What
joy
for
the
*NL*
abbe
Maslon
,
and
the
Valenods
,
if
I
die
like
an
usher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fouque
arrived
.
The
good
,
simple
man
,
was
distracted
by
grief
.
His
one
*NL*
idea
,
so
far
as
he
had
any
at
all
,
was
to
sell
all
he
possessed
in
*NL*
order
to
bribe
the
gaoler
and
secure
Julien
's
escape
.
He
talked
to
him
*NL*
at
length
of
M.
de
Lavalette
's
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
pain
me
,
''
Julien
said
to
him
.
``
M.
de
Lavalette
was
innocent
--
I
*NL*
am
guilty
.
Though
you
did
not
mean
to
,
you
made
me
think
of
the
*NL*
difference
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
true
?
What
?
were
you
going
to
sell
all
you
possessed
?
''
said
*NL*
Julien
,
suddenly
becoming
mistrustful
and
observant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fouque
was
delighted
at
seeing
his
friend
answer
his
obsessing
idea
,
*NL*
and
detailed
at
length
,
and
within
a
hundred
francs
,
what
he
would
get
*NL*
for
each
of
his
properties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
sublime
effort
for
a
small
country
land-owner
,
''
thought
Julien
.
*NL*
``
He
is
ready
to
sacrifice
for
me
the
fruits
of
all
the
economies
,
and
*NL*
all
the
little
semi-swindling
tricks
which
I
used
to
be
ashamed
of
when
*NL*
I
saw
him
practice
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
of
the
handsome
young
people
whom
I
saw
in
the
Hotel
de
la
Mole
,
*NL*
and
who
read
Rene
,
would
have
any
of
his
ridiculous
weaknesses
:
but
,
*NL*
except
those
who
are
very
young
and
who
have
also
inherited
riches
*NL*
and
are
ignorant
of
the
value
of
money
,
which
of
all
those
handsome
*NL*
Parisians
would
be
capable
of
such
a
sacrifice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
Fouque
's
mistakes
in
French
and
all
his
common
gestures
seemed
to
*NL*
disappear
.
He
threw
himself
into
his
arms
.
Never
have
the
provinces
*NL*
in
comparison
with
Paris
received
so
fine
a
tribute
.
Fouque
was
so
*NL*
delighted
with
the
momentary
enthusiasm
which
he
read
in
his
friend
's
*NL*
eyes
that
he
took
it
for
consent
to
the
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
view
of
the
sublime
recalled
to
Julien
all
the
strength
that
the
*NL*
apparition
of
M.
Chelan
had
made
him
lose
.
He
was
still
very
young
;
*NL*
but
in
my
view
he
was
a
fine
specimen
.
Instead
of
his
character
passing
*NL*
from
tenderness
to
cunning
,
as
is
the
case
with
the
majority
of
men
,
*NL*
age
would
have
given
him
that
kindness
of
heart
which
is
easily
melted
*NL*
...
but
what
avail
these
vain
prophecies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interrogations
became
more
frequent
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
*NL*
of
Julien
,
who
always
endeavoured
by
his
answers
to
shorten
the
whole
*NL*
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
killed
,
or
at
any
rate
,
I
wished
to
occasion
death
,
and
I
did
so
*NL*
with
premeditation
,
''
he
would
repeat
every
day
.
But
the
judge
was
*NL*
a
pedant
above
everything
.
Julien
's
confessions
had
no
effect
in
*NL*
curtailing
the
interrogations
.
The
judge
's
conceit
was
wounded
.
Julien
*NL*
did
not
know
that
they
had
wanted
to
transfer
him
into
an
awful
cell
,
*NL*
and
that
it
was
only
,
thanks
to
Fouque
's
efforts
,
that
he
was
allowed
*NL*
to
keep
his
pretty
room
at
the
top
of
a
hundred
and
eighty
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
the
abbe
de
Frilair
was
one
of
the
important
customers
who
entrusted
*NL*
Fouque
with
the
purveying
of
their
firewood
.
The
good
tradesmen
managed
*NL*
to
reach
the
all
powerful
grand
vicar
.
M.
de
Frilair
informed
him
,
*NL*
to
his
unspeakable
delight
,
that
he
was
so
touched
by
Julien
's
good
*NL*
qualities
,
and
by
the
services
which
he
had
formerly
rendered
to
the
*NL*
seminary
,
that
he
intended
to
recommend
him
to
the
judges
.
Fouque
*NL*
thought
he
saw
a
hope
of
saving
his
friend
,
and
as
he
went
out
,
bowing
*NL*
down
to
the
ground
,
requested
M.
the
grand
vicar
,
to
distribute
a
sum
*NL*
of
ten
louis
in
masses
to
entreat
the
acquittal
of
the
accused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fouque
was
making
a
strange
mistake
.
M.
de
Frilair
was
very
far
from
*NL*
being
a
Valenod
.
He
refused
,
and
even
tried
to
make
the
good
peasant
*NL*
understand
that
he
would
do
better
to
keep
his
money
.
Seeing
that
it
*NL*
was
impossible
to
be
clear
without
being
indiscreet
,
he
advised
him
to
*NL*
give
that
sum
as
alms
for
the
use
of
the
poor
prisoners
,
who
,
in
point
*NL*
of
fact
,
were
destitute
of
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
Julien
is
a
singular
person
,
his
action
is
unintelligible
,
''
*NL*
thought
M.
de
Frilair
,
``
and
I
ought
to
find
nothing
unintelligible
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
will
be
possible
to
make
a
martyr
of
him
...
In
any
case
,
*NL*
I
shall
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
,
and
shall
perhaps
find
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
putting
fear
into
the
heart
of
that
madame
de
Renal
*NL*
who
has
no
respect
for
us
,
and
at
the
bottom
detests
me
...
Perhaps
*NL*
I
might
be
able
to
utilise
all
this
as
a
means
of
a
brilliant
*NL*
reconciliation
with
M.
de
la
Mole
,
who
has
a
weakness
for
the
little
*NL*
seminarist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
settlement
of
the
lawsuit
had
been
signed
some
weeks
previously
,
*NL*
and
the
abbe
Pirard
had
left
Besancon
after
having
duly
mentioned
*NL*
Julien
's
mysterious
birth
,
on
the
very
day
when
the
unhappy
man
tried
*NL*
to
assassinate
madame
de
Renal
in
the
church
of
Verrieres
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
only
one
disagreeable
event
between
himself
and
his
death
*NL*
which
Julien
anticipated
.
He
consulted
Fouque
concerning
his
idea
*NL*
of
writing
to
M.
the
Procureur-General
asking
to
be
exempt
from
all
*NL*
visits
.
This
horror
at
the
sight
of
a
father
,
above
all
at
a
moment
*NL*
like
this
,
deeply
shocked
the
honest
middle-class
heart
of
the
wood
*NL*
merchant
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
he
understood
why
so
many
people
had
a
passionate
hatred
for
*NL*
his
friend
.
He
concealed
his
feelings
out
of
respect
for
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
any
case
,
''
he
answered
coldly
,
``
such
an
order
for
privacy
would
not
*NL*
be
applied
to
your
father
.

CHAPTER
LXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
A
POWERFUL
MAN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
her
proceedings
are
so
mysterious
and
her
figure
is
*NL*
so
elegant
!
Who
can
she
be
?
--
_
Schiller
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
doors
of
the
turret
opened
very
early
on
the
following
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
good
God
,
''
he
thought
,
``
here
's
my
father
!
What
an
unpleasant
*NL*
scene
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
a
woman
dressed
like
a
peasant
rushed
into
his
arms
.
*NL*
He
had
difficulty
in
recognising
her
.
It
was
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wicked
man
!
Your
letter
only
told
me
where
you
were
.
As
for
what
*NL*
you
call
your
crime
,
but
which
is
really
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
*NL*
noble
vengeance
,
which
shews
me
all
the
loftiness
of
the
heart
which
*NL*
beats
within
your
bosom
,
I
only
got
to
know
of
it
at
Verrieres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
his
prejudices
against
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
*NL*
prejudices
moreover
which
he
had
not
owned
to
himself
quite
frankly
,
*NL*
Julien
found
her
extremely
pretty
.
It
was
impossible
not
to
recognise
*NL*
both
in
what
she
had
done
and
what
she
had
said
,
a
noble
disinterested
*NL*
feeling
far
above
the
level
of
anything
that
a
petty
vulgar
soul
would
*NL*
have
dared
to
do
?
He
thought
that
he
still
loved
a
queen
,
and
after
a
*NL*
few
moments
said
to
her
with
a
remarkable
nobility
both
of
thought
and
*NL*
of
elocution
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sketched
out
the
future
very
clearly
.
After
my
death
I
intended
to
*NL*
remarry
you
to
M.
de
Croisenois
,
who
will
officially
of
course
then
*NL*
marry
a
widow
.
The
noble
but
slightly
romantic
soul
of
this
charming
*NL*
widow
,
who
will
have
been
brought
back
to
the
cult
of
vulgar
prudence
*NL*
by
an
astonishing
and
singular
event
which
played
in
her
life
a
part
*NL*
as
great
as
it
was
tragic
,
will
deign
to
appreciate
the
very
real
*NL*
merit
of
the
young
marquis
.
You
will
resign
yourself
to
be
happy
with
*NL*
ordinary
worldly
happiness
,
prestige
,
riches
,
high
rank
.
But
,
dear
*NL*
Mathilde
,
if
your
arrival
at
Besancon
is
suspected
,
it
will
be
a
mortal
*NL*
blow
for
M.
de
la
Mole
,
and
that
is
what
I
shall
never
forgive
myself
.
*NL*
I
have
already
caused
him
so
much
sorrow
.
The
academician
will
say
that
*NL*
he
has
nursed
a
serpent
in
his
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
confess
that
I
little
expected
so
much
cold
reason
and
so
much
*NL*
solicitude
for
the
future
,
''
said
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
slightly
*NL*
annoyed
.
``
My
maid
who
is
almost
as
prudent
as
you
are
,
took
a
passport
*NL*
for
herself
,
and
I
posted
here
under
the
name
of
madam
Michelet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
madame
Michelet
find
it
so
easy
to
get
to
see
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
are
still
the
same
superior
man
whom
I
chose
to
favour
.
I
*NL*
started
by
offering
a
hundred
francs
to
one
of
the
judge
's
secretaries
,
*NL*
who
alleged
at
first
that
my
admission
into
this
turret
was
impossible
.
*NL*
But
once
he
had
got
the
money
the
worthy
man
kept
me
waiting
,
raised
*NL*
objections
,
and
I
thought
that
he
meant
to
rob
me
--
''
She
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
angry
,
my
little
Julien
,
''
she
said
,
kissing
him
.
``
I
was
*NL*
obliged
to
tell
my
name
to
the
secretary
,
who
took
me
for
a
young
*NL*
working
girl
from
Paris
in
love
with
handsome
Julien
.
As
a
matter
of
*NL*
fact
those
are
his
actual
expressions
.
I
swore
to
him
,
my
dear
,
that
I
*NL*
was
your
wife
,
and
I
shall
have
a
permit
to
see
you
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
could
be
madder
,
''
thought
Julien
,
``
but
I
could
not
help
it
.
*NL*
After
all
,
M.
de
la
Mole
is
so
great
a
nobleman
that
public
opinion
*NL*
will
manage
to
find
an
excuse
for
the
young
colonel
who
will
marry
*NL*
such
a
charming
widow
.
My
death
will
atone
for
everything
;
''
and
he
*NL*
abandoned
himself
with
delight
to
Mathilde
's
love
.
It
was
madness
,
it
*NL*
was
greatness
of
soul
,
it
was
the
most
remarkable
thing
possible
.
She
*NL*
seriously
suggested
that
she
should
kill
herself
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
these
first
transports
,
when
she
had
had
her
fill
of
the
*NL*
happiness
of
seeing
Julien
,
a
keen
curiosity
suddenly
invaded
her
soul
.
*NL*
She
began
to
scrutinize
her
lover
,
and
found
him
considerably
above
*NL*
the
plane
which
she
had
anticipated
.
Boniface
de
La
Mole
seemed
to
be
*NL*
brought
to
life
again
,
but
on
a
more
heroic
scale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
saw
the
first
advocates
of
the
locality
,
and
offended
them
by
*NL*
offering
gold
too
crudely
,
but
they
finished
by
accepting
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
promptly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
so
far
as
dubious
and
far
*NL*
reaching
intrigues
were
concerned
,
everything
depended
at
Besancon
on
*NL*
M.
the
abbe
de
Frilair
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
at
first
overwhelming
difficulties
in
obtaining
an
interview
*NL*
with
the
all-powerful
leader
of
the
congregation
under
the
obscure
name
*NL*
of
madame
Michelet
.
But
the
rumour
of
the
beauty
of
a
young
dressmaker
,
*NL*
who
was
madly
in
love
,
and
had
come
from
Paris
to
Besancon
to
console
*NL*
the
young
abbe
Julien
Sorel
,
spread
over
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
walked
about
the
Besancon
streets
alone
:
she
hoped
not
to
be
*NL*
recognised
.
In
any
case
,
she
thought
it
would
be
of
some
use
to
her
*NL*
cause
if
she
produced
a
great
impression
on
the
people
.
She
thought
,
in
*NL*
her
madness
,
of
making
them
rebel
in
order
to
save
Julien
as
he
walked
*NL*
to
his
death
.
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
thought
she
was
dressed
simply
*NL*
and
in
a
way
suitable
to
a
woman
in
mourning
,
she
was
dressed
in
fact
*NL*
in
such
a
way
as
to
attract
every
one
's
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
the
object
of
everyone
's
notice
at
Besancon
when
she
obtained
*NL*
an
audience
of
M.
de
Frilair
after
a
week
spent
in
soliciting
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
her
courage
,
the
idea
of
an
influential
leader
of
the
*NL*
congregation
,
and
the
idea
of
deep
and
calculating
criminality
,
were
so
*NL*
associated
with
each
other
in
her
mind
,
that
she
trembled
as
she
rang
*NL*
the
bell
at
the
door
of
the
bishop
's
palace
.
She
could
scarcely
walk
*NL*
when
she
had
to
go
up
the
staircase
,
which
led
to
the
apartment
of
the
*NL*
first
grand
Vicar
.
The
solitude
of
the
episcopal
palace
chilled
her
.
``
I
*NL*
might
sit
down
in
an
armchair
,
and
the
armchair
might
grip
my
arms
:
I
*NL*
should
then
disappear
.
Whom
could
my
maid
ask
for
?
The
captain
of
the
*NL*
gendarmerie
will
take
care
to
do
nothing
.
I
am
isolated
in
this
great
*NL*
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
her
first
look
at
the
apartment
,
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
felt
*NL*
reassured
.
In
the
first
place
,
the
lackey
who
had
opened
the
door
to
*NL*
her
had
on
a
very
elegant
livery
.
The
salon
in
which
she
was
asked
to
*NL*
wait
displayed
that
refined
and
delicate
luxury
which
differs
so
much
*NL*
from
crude
magnificence
,
and
which
is
only
found
in
the
best
houses
in
*NL*
Paris
.
As
soon
as
she
noticed
M.
de
Frilair
coming
towards
her
with
*NL*
quite
a
paternal
air
,
all
her
ideas
of
his
criminality
disappeared
.
She
*NL*
did
not
even
find
on
his
handsome
face
the
impress
of
that
drastic
and
*NL*
somewhat
savage
courage
which
is
so
anti-pathetic
to
Paris
society
.
*NL*
The
half-smile
which
animated
the
features
of
the
priest
,
who
was
*NL*
all-powerful
at
Besancon
,
betokened
the
well-bred
man
,
the
learned
*NL*
prelate
,
the
clever
administrator
.
Mathilde
felt
herself
at
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
for
M.
de
Frilair
to
induce
Mathilde
*NL*
to
confess
to
him
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
his
powerful
opponent
,
*NL*
the
marquis
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
I
am
not
Madame
Michelet
,
''
she
said
,
reassuming
*NL*
all
the
haughtiness
of
her
natural
demeanour
,
``
and
this
confession
*NL*
costs
me
but
little
since
I
have
come
to
consult
you
,
monsieur
,
on
the
*NL*
possibility
of
procuring
the
escape
of
M.
de
la
Vernaye
.
Moreover
,
he
*NL*
is
only
guilty
of
a
piece
of
folly
;
the
woman
whom
he
shot
at
is
well
;
*NL*
and
,
in
the
second
place
,
I
can
put
down
fifty-thousand
francs
straight
*NL*
away
for
the
purpose
of
bribing
the
officials
,
and
pledge
myself
for
*NL*
twice
that
sum
.
Finally
,
my
gratitude
and
the
gratitude
of
my
family
*NL*
will
be
ready
to
do
absolutely
anything
for
the
man
who
has
saved
M.
de
*NL*
la
Vernaye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Frilair
seemed
astonished
at
the
name
.
Mathilde
shewed
him
*NL*
several
letters
from
the
Minister
of
War
,
addressed
to
M.
Julien
Sorel
*NL*
de
la
Vernaye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
monsieur
,
that
my
father
took
upon
himself
the
responsibility
*NL*
of
his
career
.
I
married
him
secretly
,
my
father
was
desirous
that
he
*NL*
should
be
a
superior
officer
before
the
notification
of
this
marriage
,
*NL*
which
,
after
all
,
is
somewhat
singular
for
a
de
la
Mole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
noticed
that
M.
de
Frilair
's
expression
of
goodwill
and
mild
*NL*
cheerfulness
was
rapidly
vanishing
in
proportion
as
he
made
certain
*NL*
important
discoveries
.
His
face
exhibited
a
subtlety
tinged
with
deep
*NL*
perfidiousness
,
the
abbe
had
doubts
,
he
was
slowly
re-reading
the
*NL*
official
documents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
get
out
of
these
strange
confidences
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
suddenly
thrown
into
intimate
relations
with
a
friend
of
*NL*
the
celebrated
marechale
de
Fervaques
,
who
is
the
all-powerful
niece
*NL*
of
my
lord
,
bishop
of
--
who
can
make
one
a
bishop
of
France
.
What
*NL*
I
looked
upon
as
an
extremely
distant
possibility
presents
itself
*NL*
unexpectedly
.
This
may
lead
me
to
the
goal
of
all
my
hopes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
was
at
first
alarmed
by
the
sudden
change
in
the
expression
*NL*
of
this
powerful
man
,
with
whom
she
was
alone
in
a
secluded
room
.
``
But
*NL*
come
,
''
she
said
to
herself
soon
afterwards
.
``
Would
it
not
have
been
*NL*
more
unfortunate
if
I
had
made
no
impression
at
all
on
the
cold
egoism
*NL*
of
a
priest
who
was
already
sated
with
power
and
enjoyment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dazzled
at
the
sight
of
this
rapid
and
unexpected
path
of
reaching
the
*NL*
episcopate
which
now
disclosed
itself
to
him
,
and
astonished
as
he
was
*NL*
by
Mathilde
's
genius
,
M.
de
Frilair
ceased
for
a
moment
to
be
on
his
*NL*
guard
.
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
saw
him
almost
at
her
feet
,
tingling
*NL*
with
ambition
,
and
trembling
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
is
cleared
up
,
''
she
thought
.
``
Madame
de
Fervaques
'
friend
*NL*
will
find
nothing
impossible
in
this
town
.
''
In
spite
of
a
sentiment
*NL*
of
still
painful
jealousy
she
had
sufficient
courage
to
explain
that
*NL*
Julien
was
the
intimate
friend
of
the
marechale
,
and
met
my
lord
the
*NL*
bishop
of
--
nearly
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
to
draw
by
ballot
four
or
five
times
in
succession
a
*NL*
list
of
thirty-six
jurymen
from
out
the
principal
inhabitants
of
this
*NL*
department
,
''
said
the
grand
Vicar
,
emphasizing
his
words
,
and
with
a
*NL*
hard
,
ambitious
expression
in
his
eyes
,
``
I
should
not
feel
inclined
to
*NL*
congratulate
myself
,
if
I
could
not
reckon
on
eight
or
ten
friends
who
*NL*
would
be
the
most
intelligent
of
the
lot
in
each
list
.
I
can
always
*NL*
manage
in
nearly
every
case
to
get
more
than
a
sufficient
majority
to
*NL*
secure
a
condemnation
,
so
you
see
,
mademoiselle
,
how
easy
it
is
for
me
*NL*
to
secure
a
conviction
.
''
The
abbe
stopped
short
as
though
astonished
*NL*
by
the
sound
of
his
own
words
;
he
was
admitting
things
which
are
never
*NL*
said
to
the
profane
.
But
he
in
his
turn
dumbfounded
Mathilde
when
he
*NL*
informed
her
that
the
special
feature
in
Julien
's
strange
adventure
*NL*
which
astonished
and
interested
Besancon
society
,
was
that
he
had
*NL*
formerly
inspired
Madame
de
Renal
with
a
grand
passion
and
reciprocated
*NL*
it
for
a
long
time
.
M.
de
Frilair
had
no
difficulty
in
perceiving
the
*NL*
extreme
trouble
which
his
story
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
my
revenge
,
''
he
thought
.
``
After
all
it
's
a
way
of
managing
*NL*
this
decided
young
person
.
I
was
afraid
that
I
should
not
succeed
.
''
Her
*NL*
distinguished
and
intractable
appearance
intensified
in
his
eyes
the
*NL*
charm
of
the
rare
beauty
whom
he
now
saw
practically
entreating
him
.
He
*NL*
regained
all
his
self-possession
--
and
he
did
not
hesitate
to
move
the
*NL*
dagger
about
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
,
''
he
said
to
her
lightly
,
``
if
we
*NL*
were
to
learn
that
it
was
owing
to
jealousy
that
M.
Sorel
fired
two
*NL*
pistol
shots
at
the
woman
he
once
loved
so
much
.
Of
course
she
must
*NL*
have
consoled
herself
and
for
some
time
she
has
been
seeing
extremely
*NL*
frequently
a
certain
abbe
Marquinot
of
Dijon
,
a
kind
of
Jansenist
,
and
*NL*
as
immoral
as
all
Jansenists
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Frilair
experienced
the
voluptuous
pleasure
of
torturing
at
*NL*
his
leisure
the
heart
of
this
beautiful
girl
whose
weakness
he
had
*NL*
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
he
added
,
as
he
fixed
his
ardent
eyes
upon
Mathilde
,
``
should
*NL*
M.
Sorel
have
chosen
the
church
,
if
it
were
not
for
the
reason
that
*NL*
his
rival
was
celebrating
mass
in
it
at
that
very
moment
?
Everyone
*NL*
attributes
an
infinite
amount
of
intelligence
and
an
even
greater
*NL*
amount
of
prudence
to
the
fortunate
man
who
is
the
object
of
your
*NL*
interest
.
What
would
have
been
simpler
than
to
hide
himself
in
the
*NL*
garden
of
M.
de
Renal
which
he
knows
so
well
.
Once
there
he
could
put
*NL*
the
woman
of
whom
he
was
jealous
to
death
with
the
practical
certainty
*NL*
of
being
neither
seen
,
caught
,
nor
suspected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
apparently
sound
train
of
reasoning
eventually
made
Mathilde
*NL*
loose
all
self-possession
.
Her
haughty
soul
steeped
in
all
that
arid
*NL*
prudence
,
which
passes
in
high
society
for
the
true
psychology
of
the
*NL*
human
heart
,
was
not
of
the
type
to
be
at
all
quick
in
appreciating
*NL*
that
joy
of
scorning
all
prudence
,
which
an
ardent
soul
can
find
so
*NL*
keen
.
In
the
high
classes
of
Paris
society
in
which
Mathilde
had
lived
,
*NL*
it
is
only
rarely
that
passion
can
divest
itself
of
prudence
,
and
*NL*
people
always
make
a
point
of
throwing
themselves
out
of
windows
from
*NL*
the
fifth
storey
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
abbe
de
Frilair
was
sure
of
his
power
over
her
.
He
gave
*NL*
Mathilde
to
understand
-LRB-
and
he
was
doubtless
lying
-RRB-
that
he
could
do
*NL*
what
he
liked
with
the
public
official
who
was
entrusted
with
the
*NL*
conduct
of
Julien
's
prosecution
.
After
the
thirty-six
jurymen
for
the
*NL*
sessions
had
been
chosen
by
ballot
,
he
would
approach
at
least
thirty
*NL*
jurymen
directly
and
personally
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
M.
de
Frilair
had
not
thought
Mathilde
so
pretty
,
he
would
not
have
*NL*
spoken
so
clearly
before
the
fifth
or
sixth
interview
.

THE
INTRIGUE

*NL*
*NL*
Castres
1676
--
A
brother
has
just
murdered
his
sister
*NL*
in
the
house
next
to
mine
.
This
gentleman
had
already
*NL*
been
guilty
of
one
murder
.
His
father
saved
his
life
by
*NL*
causing
five-hundred
crowns
to
be
distributed
among
the
*NL*
councillors

When
she
left
the
bishop
's
palace
,
Mathilde
did
not
hesitate
to
*NL*
despatch
a
courier
to
madame
de
Fervaques
.
The
fear
of
compromising
*NL*
herself
did
not
stop
her
for
a
moment
.
She
entreated
her
rival
to
*NL*
obtain
for
M.
de
Frilair
an
autograph
letter
from
the
bishop
of
--
.
*NL*
She
went
as
far
as
to
entreat
her
to
come
herself
to
Besancon
with
all
*NL*
speed
.
This
was
an
heroic
act
on
the
part
of
a
proud
and
jealous
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Acting
on
Fouque
's
advice
,
she
had
had
the
discretion
to
refrain
from
*NL*
mentioning
the
steps
she
had
taken
for
Julien
.
Her
presence
troubled
*NL*
him
enough
without
that
.
A
better
man
when
face
to
face
with
death
than
*NL*
he
had
ever
been
during
his
life
,
he
had
remorse
not
only
towards
M.
de
*NL*
la
Mole
,
but
also
towards
Mathilde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
there
are
times
when
I
feel
absent-minded
*NL*
and
even
bored
by
her
society
.
She
is
ruining
herself
on
my
account
,
*NL*
and
this
is
how
I
reward
her
.
Am
I
really
a
scoundrel
?
''
This
question
*NL*
would
have
bothered
him
but
little
in
the
days
when
he
was
ambitious
.
*NL*
In
those
days
he
looked
upon
failure
as
the
only
disgrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
moral
discomfort
when
with
Mathilde
was
proportionately
emphasized
*NL*
by
the
fact
that
he
inspired
her
at
this
time
with
the
maddest
and
most
*NL*
extraordinary
passion
.
She
talked
of
nothing
but
the
strange
sacrifices
*NL*
that
she
was
ready
to
make
in
order
to
save
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Exalted
as
she
was
by
a
sentiment
on
which
she
plumed
herself
,
to
the
*NL*
complete
subordination
of
her
pride
,
she
would
have
liked
not
to
have
*NL*
let
a
single
minute
of
her
life
go
by
without
filling
it
with
some
*NL*
extraordinary
act
.
The
strangest
projects
,
and
ones
involving
her
in
*NL*
the
utmost
danger
,
supplied
the
topics
of
her
long
interviews
with
*NL*
Julien
.
The
well-paid
gaolers
allowed
her
to
reign
over
the
prison
.
*NL*
Mathilde
's
ideas
were
not
limited
by
the
sacrifice
of
her
reputation
.
*NL*
She
would
have
thought
nothing
of
making
her
condition
known
to
society
*NL*
at
large
.
Throwing
herself
on
her
knees
before
the
king
's
carriage
*NL*
as
it
galloped
along
,
in
order
to
ask
for
Julien
's
pardon
,
and
thus
*NL*
attracting
the
attention
of
the
prince
,
at
the
risk
of
being
crushed
*NL*
a
thousand
times
over
,
was
one
of
the
least
fantastic
dreams
in
which
*NL*
this
exalted
and
courageous
imagination
chose
to
indulge
.
She
was
*NL*
certain
of
being
admitted
into
the
reserved
portion
of
the
park
of
St.
*NL*
Cloud
,
through
those
friends
of
hers
who
were
employed
at
the
king
's
*NL*
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
thought
himself
somewhat
unworthy
of
so
much
devotion
.
As
a
*NL*
matter
of
fact
,
he
was
tired
of
heroism
.
A
simple
,
naive
,
and
almost
*NL*
timid
tenderness
was
what
would
have
appealed
to
him
,
while
Mathilde
's
*NL*
haughty
soul
,
on
the
other
hand
,
always
required
the
idea
of
a
public
*NL*
and
an
audience
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
all
her
anguish
and
all
her
fears
for
the
life
of
*NL*
that
lover
whom
she
was
unwilling
to
survive
,
she
felt
a
secret
need
*NL*
of
astonishing
the
public
by
the
extravagance
of
her
love
and
the
*NL*
sublimity
of
her
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
felt
irritated
at
not
finding
himself
touched
by
all
this
*NL*
heroism
.
What
would
he
have
felt
if
he
had
known
of
all
the
mad
ideas
*NL*
with
which
Mathilde
overwhelmed
the
devoted
but
eminently
logical
and
*NL*
limited
spirit
of
the
good
Fouque
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
what
to
find
fault
with
in
Mathilde
's
devotion
.
For
*NL*
he
,
too
,
would
have
sacrificed
all
his
fortune
,
and
have
exposed
his
*NL*
life
to
the
greatest
risks
in
order
to
save
Julien
.
He
was
dumbfounded
*NL*
by
the
quantity
of
gold
which
Mathilde
flung
away
.
During
the
first
*NL*
days
Fouque
,
who
had
all
the
provincial
's
respect
for
money
,
was
much
*NL*
impressed
by
the
sums
she
spent
in
this
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
at
last
discovered
that
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
's
projects
*NL*
frequently
varied
,
and
he
was
greatly
relieved
at
finding
a
word
with
*NL*
which
to
express
his
blame
for
a
character
whom
he
found
so
exhausting
.
*NL*
She
was
changeable
.
There
is
only
a
step
from
this
epithet
to
that
of
*NL*
wrong-headed
,
the
greatest
term
of
opprobrium
known
to
the
provinces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
singular
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
,
as
Mathilde
was
going
out
*NL*
of
his
prison
one
day
,
``
that
I
should
be
so
insensible
at
being
the
*NL*
object
of
so
keen
a
passion
!
And
two
months
ago
I
adored
her
!
I
have
,
*NL*
of
course
,
read
that
the
approach
of
death
makes
one
lose
interest
*NL*
in
everything
,
but
it
is
awful
to
feel
oneself
ungrateful
,
and
not
*NL*
to
be
able
to
change
.
Am
I
an
egoist
,
then
?
''
He
addressed
the
most
*NL*
humiliating
reproaches
to
himself
on
this
score
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ambition
was
dead
in
his
heart
;
another
passion
had
arisen
from
its
*NL*
ashes
.
He
called
it
remorse
at
having
assassinated
madame
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
he
loved
her
to
the
point
of
distraction
.
He
*NL*
experienced
a
singular
happiness
on
these
occasions
when
,
being
left
*NL*
absolutely
alone
,
and
without
being
afraid
of
being
interrupted
,
he
*NL*
could
surrender
himself
completely
to
the
memory
of
the
happy
days
*NL*
which
he
had
once
passed
at
Verrieres
,
or
at
Vergy
.
The
slightest
*NL*
incidents
of
these
days
,
which
had
fleeted
away
only
too
rapidly
,
*NL*
possessed
an
irresistible
freshness
and
charm
.
He
never
gave
a
thought
*NL*
to
his
Paris
successes
;
they
bored
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
moods
,
which
became
intensified
with
every
succeeding
day
,
were
*NL*
partly
guessed
by
the
jealous
Mathilde
.
She
realised
very
clearly
that
*NL*
she
had
to
struggle
against
his
love
of
solitude
.
Sometimes
,
with
*NL*
terror
in
her
heart
,
she
uttered
madame
de
Renal
's
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
Julien
quiver
.
Henceforth
her
passion
had
neither
bounds
nor
*NL*
limit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
dies
,
I
will
die
after
him
,
''
she
said
to
herself
in
all
good
*NL*
faith
.
``
What
will
the
Paris
salons
say
when
they
see
a
girl
of
my
own
*NL*
rank
carry
her
adoration
for
a
lover
who
is
condemned
to
death
to
such
*NL*
a
pitch
as
this
?
For
sentiments
like
these
you
must
go
back
to
the
age
*NL*
of
the
heroes
.
It
was
loves
of
this
kind
which
thrilled
the
hearts
of
*NL*
the
century
of
Charles
IX
.
and
Henri
III
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
her
keenest
transports
,
when
she
was
clasping
Julien
's
*NL*
head
against
her
heart
,
she
would
say
to
herself
with
horror
,
``
What
!
*NL*
is
this
charming
head
doomed
to
fall
?
Well
,
''
she
added
,
inflamed
by
*NL*
a
not
unhappy
heroism
,
``
these
lips
of
mine
,
which
are
now
pressing
*NL*
against
this
pretty
hair
,
will
be
icy
cold
less
than
twenty-four
hours
*NL*
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thoughts
of
the
awful
voluptuousness
of
such
heroic
moments
gripped
*NL*
her
in
a
compelling
embrace
.
The
idea
of
suicide
,
absorbing
enough
*NL*
in
itself
,
entered
that
haughty
soul
-LRB-
to
which
,
up
to
the
present
it
*NL*
had
been
so
utterly
alien
-RRB-
,
and
soon
reigned
over
it
with
an
absolute
*NL*
dominion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
the
blood
of
my
ancestors
has
not
grown
tepid
in
descending
to
*NL*
me
,
''
said
Mathilde
proudly
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
favour
to
ask
of
you
,
''
said
her
lover
to
her
one
day
.
``
Put
*NL*
your
child
out
to
nurse
at
Verrieres
.
Madame
de
Renal
will
look
after
*NL*
the
nurse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
words
of
yours
are
very
harsh
.
''
And
Mathilde
paled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
and
I
ask
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
*NL*
emerging
from
his
reverie
,
and
clasping
her
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
having
dried
his
tears
,
he
reverted
to
his
original
idea
,
but
*NL*
with
greater
tact
.
He
had
given
a
twist
of
melancholy
philosophy
to
the
*NL*
conversation
.
He
talked
of
that
future
of
his
which
was
so
soon
going
*NL*
to
close
.
``
One
must
admit
,
dear
one
,
that
passions
are
an
accident
in
*NL*
life
,
but
such
accidents
only
occur
in
superior
souls
...
My
son
's
*NL*
death
would
be
in
reality
a
happiness
for
your
own
proud
family
,
and
*NL*
all
the
servants
will
realize
as
much
.
Neglect
will
be
the
lot
of
that
*NL*
child
of
shame
and
unhappiness
.
I
hope
that
,
at
a
time
which
I
do
not
*NL*
wish
to
fix
,
but
which
nevertheless
I
am
courageous
enough
to
imagine
,
*NL*
you
will
obey
my
last
advice
:
you
will
marry
the
marquis
de
Croisenois
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Dishonoured
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dishonour
can
not
attach
to
a
name
such
as
yours
.
You
will
be
a
widow
,
*NL*
and
the
widow
of
a
madman
--
that
is
all
.
I
will
go
further
--
my
crime
*NL*
will
confer
no
dishonour
,
since
it
had
no
money
motive
.
Perhaps
when
*NL*
the
time
comes
for
your
marriage
,
some
philosophic
legislator
will
have
*NL*
so
far
prevailed
on
the
prejudice
of
his
contemporaries
as
to
have
*NL*
secured
the
suppression
of
the
death
penalty
.
Then
some
friendly
voice
*NL*
will
say
,
by
way
of
giving
an
instance
:
`
Why
,
madame
de
la
Mole
's
first
*NL*
husband
was
a
madman
,
but
not
a
wicked
man
or
a
criminal
.
It
was
absurd
*NL*
to
have
his
head
cut
off
.
'
So
my
memory
will
not
be
infamous
in
any
*NL*
way
--
at
least
,
after
a
certain
time
...
Your
position
in
society
,
your
*NL*
fortune
,
and
,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
,
your
genius
,
will
make
M.
*NL*
de
Croisenois
,
once
he
is
your
husband
,
play
a
part
which
he
would
have
*NL*
never
managed
to
secure
unaided
.
He
only
possesses
birth
and
bravery
,
*NL*
and
those
qualities
alone
,
though
they
constituted
an
accomplished
man
*NL*
in
1729
,
are
an
anachronism
a
century
later
on
,
and
only
give
rise
to
*NL*
unwarranted
pretensions
.
You
need
other
things
if
you
are
to
place
*NL*
yourself
at
the
head
of
the
youth
of
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
take
all
the
help
of
your
firm
and
enterprising
character
*NL*
to
the
political
party

make
your
husband
join

You
may
*NL*
be
able
to
be
a
successor

the
Fronde

then
,
dear
one

the
divine

animates
you

have
grown

tepid

Allow
me

tell
you

he
*NL*
added
,
``
after
many

that

look

piece
of

*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
suddenly
and
became
meditative
.
He
found
himself
again
*NL*
confronted
with
the
idea
which
shocked
Mathilde
so
much
:
``
In
fifteen

years

adore

*NL*
TRANQUILITY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
because
I
was
foolish
then
that
I
am
wise
to-day
.
*NL*
Oh
thou
philosopher
who
seest
nothing
except
the
actual
*NL*
instant
.
How
short-sighted
are
thy
views
!
Thine
eye

is
not

follow
the
subterranean
work

passions

M.
Goethe

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
was
interrupted
by
an
interrogation
followed
by
*NL*
a
conference
with
the
advocate
entrusted
with
the
defence
.
These
*NL*
moments
were
the
only
absolutely
unpleasant
ones
in
a
life
made
up
of
*NL*
nonchalance
and
tender
reveries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
murder
,
and
murder
with
premeditation

''
said
Julien
to
the
*NL*
judge
as
he
had
done
to
the
advocate
,
``
I
am
sorry
,
gentlemen
,
he
added
*NL*
with
a
smile
,
that
this
reduces
your
functions
to
a
very
small
compass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
,
when
he
had
managed
to
rid
*NL*
himself
of
those
two
persons
,
``
I
must
really
be
brave
,
and
apparently
*NL*
braver
than
those
two
men
.
They
regard
that
duel
with
an
unfortunate
*NL*
termination
,
which
I
can
only
seriously
bother
myself
about
on
the
*NL*
actual
day
,
as
the
greatest
of
evils
and
the
arch-terror
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
that
I
have
known
a
much
greater
unhappiness
,
''
continued
*NL*
Julien
,
as
he
went
on
philosophising
with
himself
.
``
I
suffered
far
*NL*
more
acutely
during
my
first
journey
to
Strasbourg
,
when
I
thought
I
*NL*
was
abandoned
by
Mathilde
--
and
to
think
that
I
desired
so
passionately
*NL*
that
same
perfect
intimacy
which
to-day
leaves
me
so
cold
--
as
a
matter
*NL*
of
fact
I
am
more
happy
alone
than
when
that
handsome
girl
shares
my
*NL*
solitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
advocate
,
who
was
a
red-tape
pedant
,
thought
him
mad
,
and
believed
,
*NL*
with
the
public
,
that
it
was
jealousy
which
had
lead
him
to
take
up
*NL*
the
pistol
.
He
ventured
one
day
to
give
Julien
to
understand
that
*NL*
this
contention
,
whether
true
or
false
,
would
be
an
excellent
way
of
*NL*
pleading
.
But
the
accused
man
became
in
a
single
minute
a
passionate
*NL*
and
drastic
individual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
value
your
life
,
monsieur
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
quite
beside
*NL*
himself
,
``
mind
you
never
put
forward
such
an
abominable
lie
.
''
The
*NL*
cautious
advocate
was
for
a
moment
afraid
of
being
assassinated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
preparing
his
case
because
the
decisive
moment
was
drawing
near
.
*NL*
The
only
topic
of
conversation
in
Besancon
,
and
all
the
department
,
was
*NL*
the
_
cause
celebre
_
.
Julien
did
not
know
of
this
circumstance
.
He
had
*NL*
requested
his
friends
never
to
talk
to
him
about
that
kind
of
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
particular
day
,
Fouque
and
Mathilde
had
tried
to
inform
him
*NL*
of
certain
rumours
which
in
their
view
were
calculated
to
give
hope
.
*NL*
Julien
had
stopped
them
at
the
very
first
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
my
ideal
life
.
Your
pettifogging
troubles
and
details
of
*NL*
practical
life
all
more
or
less
jar
on
me
and
bring
me
down
from
my
*NL*
heaven
.
One
dies
as
best
one
can
:
but
I
wish
to
chose
my
own
way
of
*NL*
thinking
about
death
.
What
do
I
care
for
other
people
?
My
relations
*NL*
with
other
people
will
be
sharply
cut
short
.
Be
kind
enough
not
to
talk
*NL*
to
me
any
more
about
those
people
.
Seeing
the
judge
and
the
advocate
is
*NL*
more
than
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
it
seems
that
I
am
fated
*NL*
to
die
dreaming
.
An
obscure
creature
like
myself
,
who
is
certain
to
be
*NL*
forgotten
within
a
fortnight
,
would
be
very
silly
,
one
must
admit
,
to
*NL*
go
and
play
a
part
.
It
is
nevertheless
singular
that
I
never
knew
so
*NL*
much
about
the
art
of
enjoying
life
,
as
since
I
have
seen
its
end
so
*NL*
near
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
his
last
day
in
promenading
upon
the
narrow
terrace
at
the
*NL*
top
of
the
turret
,
smoking
some
excellent
cigars
which
Mathilde
had
*NL*
had
fetched
from
Holland
by
a
courier
.
He
had
no
suspicion
that
his
*NL*
appearance
was
waited
for
each
day
by
all
the
telescopes
in
the
town
.
*NL*
His
thoughts
were
at
Vergy
.
He
never
spoke
to
Fouque
about
madame
de
*NL*
Renal
,
but
his
friend
told
him
two
or
three
times
that
she
was
rapidly
*NL*
recovering
,
and
these
words
reverberated
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Julien
's
soul
was
nearly
all
the
time
wholly
in
the
realm
*NL*
of
ideas
,
Mathilde
,
who
,
as
befits
an
aristocratic
spirit
,
had
*NL*
occupied
herself
with
concrete
things
,
had
managed
to
make
the
*NL*
direct
and
intimate
correspondence
between
madame
de
Fervaques
and
*NL*
M.
de
Frilair
progress
so
far
that
the
great
word
bishopric
had
been
*NL*
already
pronounced
.
The
venerable
prelate
,
who
was
entrusted
with
the
*NL*
distribution
of
the
benefices
,
added
in
a
postscript
to
one
of
his
*NL*
niece
's
letters
,
``
This
poor
Sorel
is
only
a
lunatic
.
I
hope
he
will
be
*NL*
restored
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sight
of
these
lines
,
M.
de
Frilair
felt
transported
.
He
had
no
*NL*
doubts
about
saving
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
this
Jacobin
law
which
has
ordered
the
formation
of
an
*NL*
unending
panel
of
jurymen
,
and
which
has
no
other
real
object
,
except
*NL*
to
deprive
well-born
people
of
all
their
influence
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
Mathilde
on
the
eve
of
the
balloting
for
the
thirty-six
jurymen
of
the
*NL*
session
,
``
I
would
have
answered
for
the
verdict
.
I
certainly
managed
to
*NL*
get
the
cure
N
--
acquitted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
names
were
selected
by
ballot
on
the
following
day
,
M.
de
*NL*
Frilair
experienced
a
genuine
pleasure
in
finding
that
they
contained
*NL*
five
members
of
the
Besancon
congregation
and
that
amongst
those
who
*NL*
were
strangers
to
the
town
were
the
names
of
MM
.
Valenod
,
de
Moirod
,
*NL*
de
Cholin
.
I
can
answer
for
these
eight
jurymen
he
said
to
Mathilde
.
*NL*
The
first
five
are
mere
machines
,
Valenod
is
my
agent
:
Moirod
owes
me
*NL*
everything
:
de
Cholin
is
an
imbecile
who
is
frightened
of
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
journal
published
the
names
of
the
jurymen
throughout
the
*NL*
department
,
and
to
her
husband
's
unspeakable
terror
,
madame
de
Renal
*NL*
wished
to
go
to
Besancon
.
All
that
M.
de
Renal
could
prevail
on
her
*NL*
to
promise
was
that
she
would
not
leave
her
bed
so
as
to
avoid
the
*NL*
unpleasantness
of
being
called
to
give
evidence
.
``
You
do
not
understand
*NL*
my
position
,
''
said
the
former
mayor
of
Verrieres
.
``
I
am
now
said
to
*NL*
be
disloyal
and
a
Liberal
.
No
doubt
that
scoundrel
Valenod
and
M.
de
*NL*
Frilair
will
get
the
procureur-general
and
the
judges
to
do
all
they
*NL*
can
to
cause
me
unpleasantness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
found
no
difficulty
in
yielding
to
her
husband
's
*NL*
orders
.
``
If
I
appear
at
the
assize
court
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
I
*NL*
should
seem
as
if
I
were
asking
for
vengeance
.
''
In
spite
of
all
the
*NL*
promises
she
had
made
to
the
director
of
her
conscience
and
to
her
*NL*
husband
that
she
would
be
discreet
,
she
had
scarcely
arrived
at
*NL*
Besancon
before
she
wrote
with
her
own
hand
to
each
of
the
thirty-six
*NL*
jurymen
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
appear
on
the
day
of
the
trial
,
monsieur
,
because
my
*NL*
presence
might
be
prejudicial
to
M.
Sorel
's
case
.
I
only
desire
one
*NL*
thing
in
the
world
,
and
that
I
desire
passionately
--
for
him
to
be
*NL*
saved
.
Have
no
doubt
about
it
,
the
awful
idea
that
I
am
the
cause
of
an
*NL*
innocent
man
being
led
to
his
death
would
poison
the
rest
of
my
life
*NL*
and
would
no
doubt
curtail
it
.
How
can
you
condemn
him
to
death
while
I
*NL*
continue
to
live
?
No
,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
,
society
has
no
right
*NL*
to
take
away
a
man
's
life
,
and
above
all
,
the
life
of
a
being
like
*NL*
Julien
Sorel
.
Everyone
at
Verrieres
knew
that
there
were
moments
when
*NL*
he
was
quite
distracted
.
This
poor
young
man
has
some
powerful
enemies
,
*NL*
but
even
among
his
enemies
,
-LRB-
and
how
many
has
he
not
got
?
-RRB-
who
is
there
*NL*
who
casts
any
doubt
on
his
admirable
talents
and
his
deep
knowledge
?
*NL*
The
man
whom
you
are
going
to
try
,
monsieur
,
is
not
an
ordinary
person
.
*NL*
For
a
period
of
nearly
eighteen
months
we
all
knew
him
as
a
devout
and
*NL*
well
behaved
student
.
Two
or
three
times
in
the
year
he
was
seized
by
*NL*
fits
of
melancholy
that
went
to
the
point
of
distraction
.
The
whole
*NL*
town
of
Verrieres
,
all
our
neighbours
at
Vergy
,
where
we
live
in
the
*NL*
fine
weather
,
my
whole
family
,
and
monsieur
the
sub-prefect
himself
*NL*
will
render
justice
to
his
exemplary
piety
.
He
knows
all
the
Holy
Bible
*NL*
by
heart
.
Would
a
blasphemer
have
spent
years
of
study
in
learning
the
*NL*
Sacred
Book
.
My
sons
will
have
the
honour
of
presenting
you
with
this
*NL*
letter
,
they
are
children
.
Be
good
enough
to
question
them
,
monsieur
,
*NL*
they
will
give
you
all
the
details
concerning
this
poor
young
man
which
*NL*
are
necessary
to
convince
you
of
how
barbarous
it
would
be
to
condemn
*NL*
him
.
Far
from
revenging
me
,
you
would
be
putting
me
to
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
his
enemies
argue
against
this
?
The
wound

which
was
the
*NL*
result
of
one
of
those
moments
of
madness
,
which
my
children
themselves
*NL*
used
to
remark
in
their
tutor

is
so
little
dangerous
than
in
less
*NL*
than
two
months
it
has
allowed
me
to
take
the
post
from
Verrieres
to
*NL*
Besancon

If
I

that
you
show
the

hesitation

releasing
so
innocent
a

the

at

in

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
THE
TRIAL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
country
will
remember
this
celebrated
case
for
*NL*
a
long
time
.
The
interest
in
the
accused
amounted
*NL*
to
an
agitation
.
The
reason
was
that
his
crime
was
*NL*
astonishing
,
and
yet
not
atrocious
.
Even
if
it
had
been
,
*NL*
this
young
man
was
so
handsome
.
His
brilliant
career
,
*NL*
that
came
to
an
end
so
early
in
his
life
,
intensified
*NL*
the
pathos
.
``
Will
they
condemn
him
?
''
the
women
asked
of
*NL*
the
men
of
their
acquaintance
,
and
they
could
be
seen
to
*NL*
grow
pale
as
they
waited
for
the
answer
.

Sainte
Beuve

*NL*
*NL*
The
day
that
madame
de
Renal
and
Mathilde
feared
so
much
arrived
at
*NL*
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
terror
was
intensified
by
the
strange
appearance
of
the
town
,
*NL*
which
had
its
emotional
effect
even
upon
Fouque
's
sturdy
soul
.
All
the
*NL*
province
had
rushed
to
Besancon
to
see
the
trial
of
this
romantic
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
no
room
left
in
the
inns
for
some
days
.
M.
the
president
*NL*
of
the
assizes
,
was
besieged
by
requests
for
tickets
;
all
the
ladies
*NL*
in
the
town
wanted
to
be
present
at
the
trial
.
Julien
's
portrait
was
*NL*
hawked
about
the
streets
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
was
keeping
in
reserve
for
this
supreme
moment
a
complete
*NL*
autograph
letter
from
my
lord
,
bishop
of
--
.
This
prelate
,
who
*NL*
governed
the
Church
of
France
and
created
its
bishops
,
was
good
enough
*NL*
to
ask
for
Julien
's
acquittal
.
On
the
eve
of
the
trial
,
Mathilde
took
*NL*
this
letter
to
the
all-powerful
grand
vicar
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
going
away
in
tears
at
the
end
of
the
interview
,
M.
*NL*
de
Frilair
at
last
emerged
from
his
diplomatic
reserve
and
almost
*NL*
shewed
some
emotion
himself
.
``
I
will
be
responsible
for
the
jury
's
*NL*
verdict
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
``
Out
of
the
twelve
persons
charged
with
the
*NL*
investigation
of
whether
your
friend
's
crime
is
made
out
,
and
above
*NL*
all
,
whether
there
was
premeditation
,
I
can
count
six
friends
who
are
*NL*
devoted
to
my
fortunes
,
and
I
have
given
them
to
understand
that
they
*NL*
have
it
in
their
power
to
promote
me
to
the
episcopate
.
Baron
Valenod
,
*NL*
whom
I
have
made
mayor
of
Verrieres
,
can
do
just
as
he
likes
with
two
*NL*
of
his
officials
,
MM
.
de
Moirod
,
and
de
Cholin
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
*NL*
fate
has
given
us
for
this
business
two
jurymen
of
extremely
loose
*NL*
views
;
but
,
although
ultra-Liberals
,
they
are
faithful
to
my
orders
on
*NL*
great
occasions
,
and
I
have
requested
them
to
vote
like
M.
Valenod
.
*NL*
I
have
learnt
that
a
sixth
juryman
,
a
manufacturer
,
who
is
immensely
*NL*
rich
,
and
a
garrulous
Liberal
into
the
bargain
,
has
secret
aspirations
*NL*
for
a
contract
with
the
War
Office
,
and
doubtless
he
would
not
like
to
*NL*
displease
me
.
I
have
had
him
told
that
M.
de
Valenod
knows
my
final
*NL*
injunctions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
this
M.
Valenod
?
''
said
Mathilde
,
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
knew
him
,
you
could
not
doubt
our
success
.
He
is
an
audacious
*NL*
speaker
,
coarse
,
impudent
,
with
a
natural
gift
for
managing
fools
.
1814
*NL*
saw
him
in
low
water
,
and
I
am
going
to
make
a
prefect
of
him
.
He
is
*NL*
capable
of
beating
the
other
jurymen
if
they
do
not
vote
his
way
.

*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
felt
a
little
reassured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
discussion
awaited
her
in
the
evening
.
To
avoid
the
*NL*
prolongation
of
an
unpleasant
scene
,
the
result
of
which
,
in
his
view
,
*NL*
was
absolutely
certain
,
Julien
had
resolved
not
to
make
a
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
advocate
will
speak
,
''
he
said
to
Mathilde
.
``
I
shall
figure
too
long
*NL*
anyway
as
a
laughing-stock
to
all
my
enemies
.
These
provincials
have
*NL*
been
shocked
by
the
rapidity
of
my
success
,
for
which
I
have
to
thank
*NL*
you
,
and
believe
me
,
there
is
not
one
of
them
who
does
not
desire
my
*NL*
conviction
,
though
he
would
be
quite
ready
to
cry
like
an
idiot
when
I
*NL*
am
taken
to
my
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
desire
to
see
you
humiliated
.
That
is
only
too
true
,
''
answered
*NL*
Mathilde
,
``
but
I
do
not
think
they
are
at
all
cruel
.
My
presence
at
*NL*
Besancon
,
and
the
sight
of
my
sufferings
have
interested
all
the
women
;
*NL*
your
handsome
face
will
do
the
rest

If
you
say
a
few
words
to
your
*NL*
judges
,
the
whole
audience
will
be
on
your
side

At
nine
o'clock
on
the
following
day
,
when
Julien
left
his
prison
*NL*
for
the
great
hall
of
the
Palais
de
Justice
,
the
gendarmes
had
much
*NL*
difficulty
in
driving
away
the
immense
crowd
that
was
packed
in
the
*NL*
courtyard
.
Julien
had
slept
well
.
He
was
very
calm
,
and
experienced
no
*NL*
other
sentiment
except
a
sense
of
philosophic
pity
towards
that
crowd
*NL*
of
jealous
creatures
who
were
going
to
applaud
his
death
sentence
,
*NL*
though
without
cruelty
.
He
was
very
surprised
when
,
having
been
*NL*
detained
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
*NL*
he
was
obliged
to
admit
that
his
presence
affected
the
public
with
*NL*
a
tender
pity
.
He
did
not
hear
a
single
unpleasant
remark
.
``
These
*NL*
provincials
are
less
evil
than
I
thought
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
entered
the
courtroom
,
he
was
struck
by
the
elegance
of
the
*NL*
architecture
.
It
was
real
Gothic
,
with
a
number
of
pretty
little
*NL*
columns
hewn
out
of
stone
with
the
utmost
care
.
He
thought
himself
in
*NL*
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
attention
was
soon
engrossed
by
twelve
or
fifteen
pretty
*NL*
women
,
who
sat
exactly
opposite
the
prisoner
's
seat
and
filled
the
*NL*
three
balconies
above
the
judges
and
the
jury
.
As
he
turned
round
*NL*
towards
the
public
,
he
saw
that
the
circular
gallery
that
dominated
the
*NL*
amphitheatre
was
filled
with
women
,
the
majority
were
young
and
seemed
*NL*
very
pretty
,
their
eyes
were
shining
and
full
of
interest
.
The
crowd
*NL*
was
enormous
throughout
the
rest
of
the
room
.
People
were
knocking
*NL*
against
the
door
,
and
the
janitors
could
not
obtain
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
all
the
eyes
that
were
looking
for
Julien
observed
where
he
was
,
*NL*
and
saw
him
occupying
the
slightly
raised
place
which
is
reserved
for
*NL*
the
prisoner
,
he
was
greeted
by
a
murmur
of
astonishment
and
tender
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
would
have
taken
him
for
under
twenty
on
this
day
.
He
was
dressed
*NL*
very
simply
,
but
with
a
perfect
grace
.
His
hair
and
his
forehead
were
*NL*
charming
.
Mathilde
had
insisted
on
officiating
personally
at
his
*NL*
toilette
.
Julien
's
pallor
was
extreme
.
Scarcely
was
he
seated
in
this
*NL*
place
than
he
heard
people
say
all
over
the
room
,
``
Great
heavens
!
how
*NL*
young
he
is
!
...
But
he
's
quite
a
child
!
...
He
is
much
better
than
his
*NL*
portrait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prisoner
,
''
said
the
gendarme
who
was
sitting
on
his
right
,
``
do
you
see
*NL*
those
six
ladies
in
that
balcony
?
''
The
gendarme
pointed
out
a
little
*NL*
gallery
that
jutted
out
over
the
amphitheatre
where
the
jury
were
*NL*
placed
.
``
That
's
madame
,
the
prefect
's
wife
,
''
continued
the
gendarme
.
*NL*
``
Next
to
her
,
madame
the
marquise
de
M
--
.
She
likes
you
well
:
I
have
*NL*
heard
her
speak
to
the
judge
of
first
instance
.
Next
to
her
is
madame
*NL*
Derville
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Derville
!
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
and
a
vivid
blush
spread
over
his
*NL*
forehead
.
``
When
she
leaves
here
,
''
he
thought
,
``
she
will
write
to
madame
*NL*
de
Renal
.
''
He
was
ignorant
of
madame
de
Renal
's
arrival
at
Besancon
.
*NL*
The
witnesses
were
quickly
heard
.
After
the
first
words
of
the
opening
*NL*
of
the
prosecution
by
the
advocate-general
,
two
of
the
ladies
in
the
*NL*
little
balcony
just
opposite
Julien
burst
into
tears
.
Julien
noticed
*NL*
that
madame
Derville
did
not
break
down
at
all
.
He
remarked
,
however
,
*NL*
that
she
was
very
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
advocate-general
was
indulging
in
melodrama
in
bad
French
over
the
*NL*
barbarity
of
the
crime
that
had
been
perpetrated
.
Julien
noticed
that
*NL*
madame
Derville
's
neighbours
seemed
to
manifest
a
keen
disapproval
.
*NL*
Several
jurors
,
who
were
apparently
acquainted
with
the
ladies
,
spoke
*NL*
to
them
and
seemed
to
reassure
them
.
``
So
far
as
it
goes
,
that
is
*NL*
certainly
a
good
omen
,
''
thought
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
the
present
,
he
had
felt
himself
steeped
in
an
unadulterated
*NL*
contempt
for
all
the
persons
who
were
present
at
the
trial
.
This
*NL*
sentiment
of
disgust
was
intensified
by
the
stale
eloquence
of
*NL*
the
advocate-general
.
But
the
coldness
of
Julien
's
soul
gradually
*NL*
disappeared
before
the
marks
of
interest
of
which
he
was
evidently
the
*NL*
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
satisfied
with
the
sturdy
demeanour
of
his
advocate
.
``
No
*NL*
phrases
,
''
he
said
to
him
in
a
whisper
,
as
he
was
about
to
commence
his
*NL*
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
bombast
which
our
opponent
has
stolen
from
Bossuet
and
*NL*
lavished
upon
you
,
''
said
the
advocate
,
``
has
done
you
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
he
had
scarcely
spoken
for
five
minutes
before
*NL*
practically
all
the
women
had
their
handkerchiefs
in
their
hands
.
The
*NL*
advocate
was
encouraged
,
and
addressed
some
extremely
strong
remarks
*NL*
to
the
jury
.
Julien
shuddered
.
He
felt
on
the
point
of
breaking
into
*NL*
tears
.
``
My
God
,
''
he
thought
,
``
what
would
my
enemies
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
on
the
point
of
succumbing
to
the
emotion
which
was
overcoming
*NL*
him
,
when
,
luckily
for
him
,
he
surprised
an
insolent
look
from
M.
the
*NL*
baron
de
Valenod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
rogue
's
eyes
are
gleaming
,
''
he
said
to
himself
``
What
a
triumph
*NL*
for
that
base
soul
!
If
my
crime
had
only
produced
this
one
result
,
it
*NL*
would
be
my
duty
to
curse
it
.
God
knows
what
he
will
say
about
it
to
*NL*
madame
de
Renal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
effaced
all
others
.
Shortly
afterwards
Julien
was
brought
*NL*
back
to
reality
by
the
public
's
manifestation
of
applause
.
The
advocate
*NL*
had
just
finished
his
speech
.
Julien
remembered
that
it
was
good
form
*NL*
to
shake
hands
with
him
.
The
time
had
passed
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
brought
in
refreshments
for
the
advocate
and
the
prisoner
.
It
was
*NL*
only
then
that
Julien
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
none
of
the
women
had
*NL*
left
the
audience
to
go
and
get
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
I
am
dying
of
hunger
,
''
said
the
advocate
.
``
And
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
too
,
''
answered
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
there
's
madame
,
the
prefect
's
wife
,
who
is
also
getting
her
*NL*
dinner
,
''
said
the
advocate
,
as
he
pointed
out
the
little
balcony
.
``
Keep
*NL*
up
your
courage
;
everything
is
going
all
right
.
''
The
court
sat
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Midnight
struck
as
the
president
was
summing
up
.
The
president
was
*NL*
obliged
to
pause
in
his
remarks
.
Amid
the
silence
and
the
anxiety
of
*NL*
all
present
,
the
reverberation
of
the
clock
filled
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
my
last
day
is
now
beginning
,
''
thought
Julien
.
He
soon
felt
*NL*
inflamed
by
the
idea
of
his
duty
.
Up
to
the
present
he
had
controlled
*NL*
his
emotion
and
had
kept
his
resolution
not
to
speak
.
When
the
*NL*
president
of
the
assizes
asked
him
if
he
had
anything
to
add
,
he
got
*NL*
up
.
He
saw
in
front
of
him
the
eyes
of
madame
Derville
,
which
seemed
*NL*
very
brilliant
in
the
artificial
light
.
``
Can
she
by
any
chance
be
*NL*
crying
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
induced
to
speak
by
my
fear
of
that
contempt
which
I
thought
,
*NL*
at
the
very
moment
of
my
death
,
I
should
be
able
to
defy
.
Gentlemen
,
*NL*
I
have
not
the
honour
of
belonging
to
your
class
.
You
behold
in
me
a
*NL*
peasant
who
has
rebelled
against
the
meanness
of
his
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
ask
you
for
any
pardon
,
''
continued
Julien
,
with
a
firmer
*NL*
note
in
his
voice
.
``
I
am
under
no
illusions
.
Death
awaits
me
;
it
*NL*
will
be
just
.
I
have
brought
myself
to
make
an
attempt
on
the
life
*NL*
of
the
woman
who
is
most
worthy
of
all
reverence
and
all
respect
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
a
mother
to
me
.
My
crime
was
atrocious
,
and
it
*NL*
was
premeditated
.
Consequently
,
I
have
deserved
death
,
gentlemen
of
*NL*
the
jury
.
But
even
if
I
were
not
so
guilty
,
I
see
among
you
men
who
,
*NL*
without
a
thought
for
any
pity
that
may
be
due
to
my
youth
,
would
like
*NL*
to
use
me
as
a
means
for
punishing
and
discouraging
for
ever
that
class
*NL*
of
young
man
who
,
though
born
in
an
inferior
class
,
and
to
some
extent
*NL*
oppressed
by
poverty
,
have
none
the
less
been
fortunate
enough
to
*NL*
obtain
a
good
education
,
and
bold
enough
to
mix
with
what
the
pride
of
*NL*
the
rich
calls
Society
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
crime
,
gentlemen
,
and
it
will
be
punished
with
even
more
*NL*
severity
,
inasmuch
as
,
in
fact
,
I
am
very
far
from
being
judged
by
my
*NL*
peers
.
I
do
not
see
on
the
jury
benches
any
peasant
who
has
made
money
,
*NL*
but
only
indignant
bourgeois
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
talked
in
this
strain
for
twenty
minutes
.
He
said
everything
*NL*
he
had
on
his
mind
.
The
advocate-general
,
who
aspired
to
the
favours
*NL*
of
the
aristocracy
,
writhed
in
his
seat
.
But
in
spite
of
the
somewhat
*NL*
abstract
turn
which
Julien
had
given
to
his
speech
,
all
the
women
*NL*
burst
out
into
tears
.
Even
madame
Derville
put
her
handkerchief
to
*NL*
her
eyes
.
Before
finishing
,
Julien
alluded
again
to
the
fact
of
his
*NL*
premeditation
,
to
his
repentance
,
and
to
the
respect
and
unbounded
*NL*
filial
admiration
which
,
in
happier
days
,
he
had
entertained
for
madame
*NL*
de
Renal
...
Madame
Derville
gave
a
cry
and
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
o'clock
was
striking
when
the
jury
retired
to
their
room
.
None
of
*NL*
the
women
had
left
their
places
;
several
men
had
tears
in
their
eyes
.
*NL*
The
conversations
were
at
first
very
animated
,
but
,
as
there
was
a
*NL*
delay
in
the
verdict
of
the
jury
,
their
general
fatigue
gradually
began
*NL*
to
invest
the
gathering
with
an
atmosphere
of
calm
.
It
was
a
solemn
*NL*
moment
;
the
lights
grew
less
brilliant
.
Julien
,
who
was
very
tired
,
*NL*
heard
people
around
him
debating
the
question
of
whether
this
delay
was
*NL*
a
good
or
a
bad
omen
.
He
was
pleased
to
see
that
all
the
wishes
were
*NL*
for
him
.
The
jury
did
not
come
back
,
and
yet
not
a
woman
left
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
two
o'clock
had
struck
,
a
great
movement
was
heard
.
The
little
*NL*
door
of
the
jury
room
opened
.
M.
the
baron
de
Valenod
advanced
with
*NL*
a
slow
and
melodramatic
step
.
He
was
followed
by
all
the
jurors
.
He
*NL*
coughed
,
and
then
declared
on
his
soul
and
conscience
that
the
jury
's
*NL*
unanimous
verdict
was
that
Julien
Sorel
was
guilty
of
murder
,
and
of
*NL*
murder
with
premeditation
.
This
verdict
involved
the
death
penalty
,
*NL*
which
was
pronounced
a
moment
afterwards
.
Julien
looked
at
his
watch
,
*NL*
and
remembered
M.
de
Lavalette
.
It
was
a
quarter
past
two
.
``
To-day
is
*NL*
Friday
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
this
day
is
lucky
for
the
Valenod
who
has
got
me
*NL*
convicted
...
I
am
watched
too
well
for
Mathilde
to
manage
to
save
me
*NL*
like
madame
de
Lavalette
saved
her
husband
...
So
in
three
days
'
time
,
*NL*
at
this
very
hour
,
I
shall
know
what
view
to
take
about
the
great
*NL*
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
he
heard
a
cry
and
was
called
back
to
the
things
of
this
*NL*
world
.
The
women
around
him
were
sobbing
:
he
saw
that
all
faces
were
*NL*
turned
towards
a
little
gallery
built
into
the
crowning
of
a
Gothic
*NL*
pilaster
.
He
knew
later
that
Mathilde
had
concealed
herself
there
.
As
*NL*
the
cry
was
not
repeated
,
everybody
began
to
look
at
Julien
again
,
as
*NL*
the
gendarmes
were
trying
to
get
him
through
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
try
not
to
give
that
villain
Valenod
any
chance
of
laughing
*NL*
at
me
,
''
thought
Julien
.
``
With
what
a
contrite
sycophantic
expression
*NL*
he
pronounced
the
verdict
which
entails
the
death
penalty
,
while
that
*NL*
poor
president
of
the
assizes
,
although
he
has
been
a
judge
for
years
*NL*
and
years
,
had
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
sentenced
me
.
What
a
joy
the
*NL*
Valenod
must
find
in
revenging
himself
for
our
former
rivalry
for
*NL*
madame
de
Renal
's
favors
!
...
So
I
shall
never
see
her
again
!
The
thing
*NL*
is
finished
...
A
last
good-bye
between
us
is
impossible
--
I
feel
it
...
*NL*
How
happy
I
should
have
been
to
have
told
her
all
the
horror
I
feel
for
*NL*
my
crime
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mere
words
.
I
consider
myself
justly
convicted
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
When
Julien
was
taken
back
to
prison
he
had
been
taken
into
a
room
*NL*
intended
for
those
who
were
condemned
to
death
.
Although
a
man
who
in
*NL*
the
usual
way
would
notice
the
most
petty
details
,
he
had
quite
failed
*NL*
to
observe
that
he
had
not
been
taken
up
to
his
turret
.
He
was
thinking
*NL*
of
what
he
would
say
to
madame
de
Renal
if
he
had
the
happiness
of
*NL*
seeing
her
before
the
final
moment
.
He
thought
that
she
would
break
*NL*
into
what
he
was
saying
and
was
anxious
to
be
able
to
express
his
*NL*
absolute
repentance
with
his
very
first
words
.
``
How
can
I
convince
her
*NL*
that
I
love
her
alone
after
committing
an
action
like
that
?
For
after
*NL*
all
,
it
was

*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
to
bed
,
he
came
across
sheets
of
a
rough
coarse
material
.
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
am
in

he
said
to
himself

*NL*
``

to
tell

his
loud
voice

went
on
Julien

Upon
my

*NL*
it
will
be
all
up
with
me
if
I
find
the
God
of
the
Christians
there
:
He
*NL*
is
a
tyrant
,
and
as
such
,
he
is
full
of
ideas
of
vengeance
:
his
Bible
*NL*
speaks
of
nothing
but
atrocious
punishment
.
I
never
liked
him
--
I
could
*NL*
never
get
myself
to
believe
that
anyone
really
liked
him

He
has
no

he
remembered
several
passages
in
the
Bible
-RRB-
he
will
punish
*NL*
me
atrociously

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
supposing
I
find
Fenelon

God

He
will
perhaps
say
to
me
:
`
Much

forgiveness

be
vouchsafed
to
thee

thou
hast
loved

Have
I
loved
much

Ah

I
loved
madame

my
conduct
has
*NL*
been
atrocious

In
that
,
as
in
other
cases
,
simple
modest
merit
was
*NL*
abandoned
for
the
sake
of
what
was
brilliant

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
still

I
should
soon
have
picked
up
politics

even
if
I

would
the
marquis

have
had
any
rivalry
*NL*
to
fear

All
my
stupidities
have
been
forgiven

rather

counted
*NL*
as
merits

A

of

then

living
in
the
grandest

``
Not

*NL*
Julien
laughed
heartily
at
this
sally
of
his
wit
.
``
As
a
matter
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

yes
,
my

guillotined

he
answered
the
*NL*
interruptor
.
``

''
The
*NL*
following
passage
from
Rotrou
's
``
Venceslas
''
suddenly
came
back
into
his
*NL*
mind
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
LADISLAS

...
...
...
.
.
Mon

*NL*
THE

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
repartee
''
he
thought
,
as
he
went
to
sleep
.
He
was
awakened
in
*NL*
the
morning
by
someone
catching
hold
of
him
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
already
,
''
said
Julien
,
opening
his
haggard
eyes
.
He
thought
he
*NL*
was
already
in
the
executioner
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Mathilde
.
``
Luckily
,
she
has
not
understood
me
.
''
This
reflection
*NL*
restored
all
his
self
possession
.
He
found
Mathilde
as
changed
as
*NL*
though
she
had
gone
through
a
six
months
'
illness
:
she
was
really
not
*NL*
recognisable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
infamous
Frilair
has
betrayed
me
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
wringing
her
*NL*
hands
.
Her
fury
prevented
her
from
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
not
fine
when
I
made
my
speech
yesterday
?
''
answered
Julien
.
``
I
*NL*
was
improvising
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
!
It
is
true
that
it
is
to
*NL*
be
feared
that
it
will
also
be
the
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
,
Julien
was
playing
on
Mathilde
's
character
with
all
*NL*
the
self-possession
of
a
clever
pianist
,
whose
fingers
are
on
the
*NL*
instrument
...
``
It
is
true
,
''
he
added
,
``
that
I
lack
the
advantage
of
a
*NL*
distinguished
birth
,
but
Mathilde
's
great
soul
has
lifted
her
lover
up
*NL*
to
her
own
level
.
Do
you
think
that
Boniface
de
la
Mole
would
have
cut
*NL*
a
better
figure
before
his
judges
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
particular
day
,
Mathilde
was
as
unaffectedly
tender
as
a
poor
*NL*
girl
living
in
a
fifth
storey
.
But
she
failed
to
extract
from
him
any
*NL*
simpler
remark
.
He
was
paying
her
back
without
knowing
it
for
all
the
*NL*
torture
she
had
frequently
inflicted
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sources
of
the
Nile
are
unknown
,
''
said
Julien
to
himself
:
``
it
has
*NL*
not
been
vouchsafed
to
the
human
eye
to
see
the
king
of
rivers
as
a
*NL*
simple
brook
:
similarly
,
no
human
eye
shall
see
Julien
weak
.
In
the
*NL*
first
place
because
he
is
not
so
.
But
I
have
a
heart
which
it
is
easy
*NL*
to
touch
.
The
most
commonplace
words
,
if
said
in
a
genuine
tone
,
can
*NL*
make
my
voice
broken
and
even
cause
me
to
shed
tears
.
How
often
have
*NL*
frigid
characters
not
despised
me
for
this
weakness
.
They
thought
that
*NL*
I
was
asking
a
favour
:
that
is
what
I
can
not
put
up
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
said
that
when
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
,
Danton
was
affected
*NL*
by
the
thought
of
his
wife
:
but
Danton
had
given
strength
to
a
nation
*NL*
of
coxcombs
and
prevented
the
enemy
from
reaching
Paris
...
I
alone
*NL*
know
what
I
should
have
been
able
to
do
...
I
represent
to
the
others

at
the
very
outside

simply
A
PERHAPS

*NL*
``
If
madame
de
Renal
had
been
here
in
my
cell
instead
of
Mathilde
,
*NL*
should
I
have
been
able
to
have
answered
for
myself
?
The
extremity
of
*NL*
my
despair
and
my
repentance
would
have
been
taken
for
a
craven
fear
of
*NL*
death
by
the
Valenods
and
all
the
patricians
of
the
locality
.
They
are
*NL*
so
proud

are
those
feeble
spirits

whom
their
pecuniary
position
puts

above
temptation

clever

qualities

Even
in

case

poor

is
crying
now

rather
,
who
can
not

he
said
to
himself
,
as
he
looked
at
her
red
eyes
...
And
he
*NL*
clasped
her
in
his
arms
:
the
sight
of
a
genuine
grief
made
him
forget
*NL*
the
sequence
of
his
logic
...
``
She
has
perhaps
cried
all
the
night

he
*NL*
said
to
himself
,
``
but
how
ashamed
she
will
be
of
this
memory
on
some

been
led
astray

kept
on
repeating
in

At

*NL*
*NL*
This
unexpected
opposition
awakened
all
the
haughtiness
of
Mathilde
's
*NL*
character
.
She
had
not
managed
to
see
the
abbe
de
Frilair
before
the
*NL*
time
when
visitors
were
admitted
to
the
cells
in
the
Besancon
prison
.
*NL*
Her
fury
vented
itself
on
Julien
.
She
adored
him
,
and
nevertheless
she
*NL*
exhibited
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
in
her
invective
against
his
,
*NL*
Julien
's
,
character
,
and
her
regret
at
having
ever
loved
him
,
the
*NL*
same
haughty
soul
which
had
formerly
overwhelmed
him
with
such
cutting
*NL*
insults
in
the
library
of
the
Hotel
de

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

he
thought
,

butt
for
all
the
infamous
humiliations

the
patrician
party
can
*NL*
devise
,
-LSB-

and
having
the
outburst
of
this
mad

for

only

consolation
...
Well

the
Mephistophelian

Well

Mathilde
continued
to
wax
*NL*
eloquent
-RRB-

``
No

he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
shall
not

*NL*
*NL*
Having
made
this
resolution

he
fell
into
meditation

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
courier
will
bring
the

six
o'clock

as

passes

at
eight
o'clock
,
after
M.
de
Renal
has
finished
reading
it
,
*NL*
Elisa
will
go
on
tiptoe
and
place
it
on
her
bed
.
Later
on
she
will
wake
*NL*
up
;
suddenly
,
as
she
reads
it
she
will
become
troubled
;
her
pretty
*NL*
hands
will
tremble
;
she
will
go
on
reading
down
to
these
words
:
_
At
*NL*
five
minutes
past
ten
he
had
ceased
to
exist
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
shed
hot
tears
,
I
know
her
;
it
will
matter
nothing
that
I
*NL*
tried
to
assassinate
her
--
all
will
be
forgotten
,
and
the
person
whose
*NL*
life
I
wished
to
take
will
be
the
only
one
who
will
sincerely
lament
my
*NL*
death

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
a
good
paradox

he
thought
,
and
he
thought
about
nothing
*NL*
except
madame
de
Renal
during
the
good
quarter
of
an
hour
which
the
*NL*
scene
Mathilde
was
making
still
lasted
.
In
spite
of
himself
,
and
though
*NL*
he
made
frequent
answers
to
what
Mathilde
was
saying
,
he
could
not
take
*NL*
his
mind
away
from
the
thought
of
the
bedroom
at
Verrieres
.
He
saw
the
*NL*
Besancon
Gazette
on
the
counterpane
of
orange
taffeta
;
he
saw
that
*NL*
white
hand
clutching
at
it
convulsively
.
He
saw
madame
de
Renal
cry
...
*NL*
He
followed
the
path
of
every
tear
over
her
charming
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
,
being
unable
to
get
anything
out
of
Julien
,
*NL*
asked
the
advocate
to
come
in
.
Fortunately
,
he
was
an
old
captain
of
*NL*
the
Italian
army
of
1796
,
where
he
had
been
a
comrade
of
Manuel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opposed
the
condemned
man
's
resolution
as
a
matter
of
form
.
Wishing
*NL*
to
treat
him
with
respect
,
Julien
explained
all
his
reasons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
I
can
understand
a
man
taking
the
view
you
do
,
''
said
*NL*
M.
Felix
Vaneau
-LRB-
that
was
the
advocate
's
name
-RRB-
to
him
at
last
.
``
But
*NL*
you
have
three
full
days
in
which
to
appeal
,
and
it
is
my
duty
to
come
*NL*
back
every
day
.
If
a
volcano
were
to
open
under
the
prison
between
now
*NL*
and
two
months
'
time
you
would
be
saved
.
You
might
die
of
illness

''
he
*NL*
said
,
looking
at
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
pressed
his
hand
--
``
I
thank
you
,
you
are
a
good
fellow

I
will
*NL*
think
it
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
Mathilde
eventually
left
with
the
advocate
,
he
felt
much
more
*NL*
affection
for
the
advocate
than
for

CHAPTER
LXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
deep
asleep
an
hour
afterwards
,
he
was
woken
up
by
feeling
*NL*
tears
flow
over
his
hand
.
``
Oh
,
it
is
Mathilde
again
,
''
he
thought
,
only
*NL*
half
awake
.
``
She
has
come
again
,
faithful
to
her
tactics
of
attacking
*NL*
my
resolution
by
her
sentimentalism
.
''
Bored
by
the
prospect
of
this
*NL*
new
scene
of
hackneyed
pathos
he
did
not
open
his
eyes
.
The
verses
of
*NL*
Belphgor
,
as
he
ran
away
from
his
wife
,
came
into
his
mind
.
He
heard
a
*NL*
strange
sigh
.
He
opened
his
eyes
.
It
was
madame
de
Renal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
so
I
see
you
again
before
I
die
,
or
is
it
an
illusion
,
''
he
*NL*
exclaimed
as
he
threw
himself
at
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
forgive
me
,
madame
,
you
must
look
upon
me
as
a
mere
murderer
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
immediately
,
as
he
recovered
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
I
have
come
to
entreat
you
to
appeal
;
I
know
you
do
not
want
*NL*
to
...
''
her
sobs
choked
her
;
she
was
unable
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deign
to
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
want
me
to
forgive
you
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
getting
up
and
*NL*
throwing
herself
into
his
arms
,
``
appeal
immediately
against
your
death
*NL*
sentence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
covered
her
with
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
come
and
see
me
every
day
during
those
two
months
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
it
--
every
day
,
unless
my
husband
forbids
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
sign
it
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
really
forgive
me
!
Is
it
possible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
clasped
her
in
his
arms
;
he
was
mad
.
She
gave
a
little
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
nothing
,
''
she
said
to
him
.
``
You
hurt
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
shoulder
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
bursting
into
tears
.
He
drew
back
*NL*
a
little
,
and
covered
her
hands
with
kisses
of
fire
.
``
Who
could
*NL*
have
prophesied
this
,
dear
,
the
last
time
I
saw
you
in
your
room
at
*NL*
Verrieres
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
could
have
prophesied
then
that
I
should
write
that
infamous
*NL*
letter
to
M.
de
la
Mole
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
that
I
have
always
loved
you
,
and
that
I
have
never
loved
anyone
*NL*
but
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
?
''
cried
Madame
de
Renal
,
who
was
delighted
in
her
turn
.
*NL*
She
leant
on
Julien
,
who
was
on
his
knees
,
and
they
cried
silently
for
*NL*
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
never
experienced
moments
like
this
at
any
period
of
his
*NL*
whole
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
about
that
young
madame
Michelet
?
''
said
Madame
de
Renal
,
a
*NL*
long
time
afterwards
when
they
were
able
to
speak
.
``
Or
rather
,
that
*NL*
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
?
for
I
am
really
beginning
to
believe
in
that
*NL*
strange
romance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
only
superficially
true
,
''
answered
Julien
.
``
She
is
my
wife
,
but
*NL*
she
is
not
my
mistress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
interrupting
each
other
a
hundred
times
over
,
they
managed
with
*NL*
great
difficulty
to
explain
to
each
other
what
they
did
not
know
.
The
*NL*
letter
written
to
M.
de
la
Mole
had
been
drafted
by
the
young
priest
*NL*
who
directed
Madame
de
Renal
's
conscience
,
and
had
been
subsequently
*NL*
copied
by
her
,
``
What
a
horrible
thing
religion
has
made
me
do
,
''
she
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
and
even
so
I
softened
the
most
awful
passages
in
the
*NL*
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
's
ecstatic
happiness
proved
the
fulness
of
her
forgiveness
.
He
*NL*
had
never
been
so
mad
with
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
regard
myself
as
devout
,
''
madame
de
Renal
went
on
to
say
to
*NL*
him
in
the
ensuing
conversation
.
``
I
believe
sincerely
in
God
!
I
equally
*NL*
believe
,
and
I
even
have
full
proof
of
it
,
that
the
crime
which
I
am
*NL*
committing
is
an
awful
one
,
and
yet
the
very
minute
I
see
you
,
even
*NL*
after
you
have
fired
two
pistol
shots
at
me
--
''
and
at
this
point
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
her
resistance
,
Julien
covered
her
with
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
alone
,
''
she
continued
,
``
I
want
to
argue
with
you
,
I
am
*NL*
frightened
lest
I
should
forget
...
The
very
minute
I
see
you
all
my
*NL*
duties
disappear
.
I
have
nothing
but
love
for
you
,
dear
,
or
rather
,
the
*NL*
word
love
is
too
weak
.
I
feel
for
you
what
I
ought
only
to
feel
for
*NL*
God
;
a
mixture
of
respect
,
love
,
obedience
...
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
you
inspire
me
with
...
If
you
were
to
tell
me
to
stab
*NL*
the
gaoler
with
a
knife
,
the
crime
would
be
committed
before
I
had
*NL*
given
it
a
thought
.
Explain
this
very
clearly
to
me
before
I
leave
you
.
*NL*
I
want
to
see
down
to
the
bottom
of
my
heart
;
for
we
shall
take
leave
*NL*
of
each
other
in
two
months
...
By
the
bye
,
shall
we
take
leave
of
each
*NL*
other
?
''
she
said
to
him
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
back
my
words
,
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
getting
up
,
``
I
shall
not
*NL*
appeal
from
my
death
sentence
,
if
you
try
,
either
by
poison
,
knife
,
*NL*
pistol
,
charcoal
,
or
any
other
means
whatsoever
,
to
put
an
end
to
your
*NL*
life
,
or
make
any
attempt
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
's
expression
suddenly
changed
.
The
most
lively
*NL*
tenderness
was
succeeded
by
a
mood
of
deep
meditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Supposing
we
were
to
die
at
once
,
''
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
knows
what
one
will
find
in
the
other
life
,
''
answered
Julien
,
*NL*
``
perhaps
torment
,
perhaps
nothing
at
all
.
Can
not
we
pass
two
delicious
*NL*
months
together
?
Two
months
means
a
good
many
days
.
I
shall
never
have
*NL*
been
so
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
never
have
been
so
happy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
repeated
Julien
ecstatically
,
``
and
I
am
talking
to
you
just
as
*NL*
I
should
talk
to
myself
.
May
God
save
me
from
exaggerating
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Words
like
that
are
a
command
,
''
she
said
with
a
timid
melancholy
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
will
swear
by
the
love
you
have
for
me
,
to
make
no
attempt
*NL*
either
direct
or
indirect
,
upon
your
life
...
remember
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
``
that
you
must
live
for
my
son
,
whom
Mathilde
will
hand
over
to
lackeys
*NL*
as
soon
as
she
is
marquise
de
Croisenois
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
,
''
she
answered
coldly
,
``
but
I
want
to
take
away
your
notice
*NL*
of
appeal
,
drawn
and
signed
by
yourself
.
I
will
go
myself
to
M.
the
*NL*
procureur-general
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
careful
,
you
will
compromise
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
having
taken
the
step
of
coming
to
see
you
in
your
prison
,
I
*NL*
shall
be
a
heroine
of
local
scandal
for
Besancon
,
and
the
whole
of
*NL*
Franche-Comte
,
''
she
said
very
dejectedly
.
``
I
have
crossed
the
bounds
of
*NL*
austere
modesty
...
I
am
a
woman
who
has
lost
her
honour
;
it
is
true
*NL*
that
it
is
for
your
sake
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
was
so
sad
that
Julien
embraced
her
with
a
happiness
which
was
*NL*
quite
novel
to
him
.
It
was
no
longer
the
intoxication
of
love
,
it
was
*NL*
extreme
gratitude
.
He
had
just
realised
for
the
first
time
the
full
*NL*
extent
of
the
sacrifice
which
she
had
made
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
charitable
soul
,
no
doubt
informed
M.
de
Renal
of
the
long
visits
*NL*
which
his
wife
paid
to
Julien
's
prison
;
for
at
the
end
of
three
days
*NL*
he
sent
her
his
carriage
with
the
express
order
to
return
to
Verrieres
*NL*
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
cruel
separation
had
been
a
bad
beginning
for
Julien
's
day
.
He
*NL*
was
informed
two
or
three
hours
later
that
a
certain
intriguing
priest
*NL*
-LRB-
who
had
,
however
,
never
managed
to
make
any
headway
among
the
Jesuits
*NL*
of
Besancon
-RRB-
had
,
since
the
morning
,
established
himself
in
the
street
*NL*
outside
the
prison
gates
.
It
was
raining
a
great
deal
,
and
the
man
out
*NL*
there
was
pretending
to
play
the
martyr
.
Julien
was
in
a
weak
mood
,
and
*NL*
this
piece
of
stupidity
annoyed
him
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
he
had
already
refused
this
priest
's
visit
,
but
the
man
*NL*
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
confess
Julien
,
and
to
win
a
name
for
*NL*
himself
among
the
young
women
of
Besancon
by
all
the
confidences
which
*NL*
he
would
pretend
to
have
received
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
declared
in
a
loud
voice
that
he
would
pass
the
day
and
the
night
by
*NL*
the
prison
gates
.
``
God
has
sent
me
to
touch
the
heart
of
this
apostate
*NL*
...
''
and
the
lower
classes
,
who
are
always
curious
to
see
a
scene
,
*NL*
began
to
make
a
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
brothers
,
''
he
said
to
them
,
``
I
will
pass
the
day
here
and
the
*NL*
night
,
as
well
as
all
the
days
and
all
the
nights
which
will
follow
.
*NL*
The
Holy
Ghost
has
spoken
to
me
.
I
am
commissioned
from
above
;
I
am
the
*NL*
man
who
must
save
the
soul
of
young
Sorel
.
Do
you
join
in
my
prayers
,
*NL*
etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
a
horror
of
scandal
,
and
of
anything
which
could
attract
*NL*
attention
to
him
.
He
thought
of
seizing
the
opportunity
of
escaping
*NL*
from
the
world
incognito
;
but
he
had
some
hope
of
seeing
madame
de
*NL*
Renal
again
,
and
he
was
desperately
in
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prison
gates
were
situated
in
one
of
the
most
populous
streets
.
His
*NL*
soul
was
tortured
by
the
idea
of
this
filthy
priest
attracting
a
crowd
*NL*
and
creating
a
scandal
--
``
and
doubtless
he
is
repeating
my
name
at
every
*NL*
single
minute
!
''
This
moment
was
more
painful
than
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
called
the
turnkey
who
was
devoted
to
him
,
and
sent
sent
him
two
or
*NL*
three
times
at
intervals
of
one
hour
to
see
if
the
priest
was
still
by
*NL*
the
prison
gates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
turnkey
to
him
on
each
occasion
,
``
he
is
on
both
*NL*
his
knees
in
the
mud
;
he
is
praying
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
and
saying
*NL*
litanies
for
your
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
impudent
fellow
,
''
thought
Julien
.
At
this
moment
he
actually
heard
*NL*
a
dull
buzz
.
It
was
the
responses
of
the
people
to
the
litanies
.
His
*NL*
patience
was
strained
to
the
utmost
when
he
saw
the
turnkey
himself
*NL*
move
his
lips
while
he
repeated
the
Latin
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
beginning
to
say
,
''
added
the
turnkey
,
``
that
you
must
have
a
*NL*
very
hardened
heart
to
refuse
the
help
of
this
holy
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
my
country
,
how
barbarous
you
still
are
!
''
exclaimed
Julien
,
beside
*NL*
himself
with
anger
.
And
he
continued
his
train
of
thought
aloud
,
*NL*
without
giving
a
thought
to
the
turn-key
's
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
wants
an
article
in
the
paper
about
him
,
and
that
's
a
way
in
*NL*
which
he
will
certainly
get
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
cursed
provincials
!
At
Paris
I
should
not
be
subjected
to
all
*NL*
these
annoyances
.
There
they
are
more
skilled
in
their
charlatanism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
in
the
holy
priest
,
''
he
said
at
last
to
the
turnkey
,
and
great
*NL*
streams
of
sweat
flowed
down
his
forehead
.
The
turnkey
made
the
sign
of
*NL*
the
cross
and
went
out
rejoicing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
holy
priest
turned
out
to
be
very
ugly
,
he
was
even
dirtier
than
he
*NL*
was
ugly
.
The
cold
rain
intensified
the
obscurity
and
dampness
of
the
*NL*
cell
.
The
priest
wanted
to
embrace
Julien
,
and
began
to
wax
pathetic
as
*NL*
he
spoke
to
him
.
The
basest
hypocrisy
was
only
too
palpable
;
Julien
had
*NL*
never
been
so
angry
in
his
whole
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
priest
had
come
in
Julien
felt
an
*NL*
absolute
coward
.
Death
appeared
horrible
to
him
for
the
first
time
.
He
*NL*
began
to
think
about
the
state
of
decomposition
which
his
body
would
be
*NL*
in
two
days
after
the
execution
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
on
the
point
of
betraying
himself
by
some
sign
of
weakness
or
*NL*
throwing
himself
on
the
priest
and
strangling
him
with
his
chain
,
when
*NL*
it
occurred
to
him
to
beg
the
holy
man
to
go
and
say
a
good
forty
franc
*NL*
mass
for
him
on
that
very
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
twelve
o'clock
,
so
the
priest
took
himself
off
.

*NL*
As
soon
as
he
had
gone
out
Julien
wept
desperately
and
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
He
gradually
admitted
to
himself
that
if
madame
de
Renal
had
been
at
*NL*
Besancon
he
would
have
confessed
his
weakness
to
her
.
The
moment
when
*NL*
he
was
regretting
the
absence
of
this
beloved
woman
he
heard
Mathilde
's
*NL*
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
worst
evil
of
being
in
prison
,
''
he
thought
``
is
one
's
inability
to
*NL*
close
one
's
door
.
''
All
Mathilde
said
only
irritated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
him
that
M.
de
Valenod
had
had
his
nomination
to
the
*NL*
prefectship
in
his
pocket
on
the
day
of
his
trial
,
and
had
consequently
*NL*
dared
to
defy
M.
de
Frilair
and
give
himself
the
pleasure
of
condemning
*NL*
him
to
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
your
friend
take
it
into
his
head
,
''
M.
de
Frilair
just
said
*NL*
to
me
,
``
to
awaken
and
attack
the
petty
vanity
of
that
bourgeois
*NL*
aristocracy
.
Why
talk
about
caste
?
He
pointed
out
to
them
what
they
*NL*
ought
to
do
in
their
own
political
interest
;
the
fools
had
not
been
*NL*
giving
it
a
thought
and
were
quite
ready
to
weep
.
That
caste
interest
*NL*
intervened
and
blinded
their
eyes
to
the
horror
of
condemning
a
man
to
*NL*
death
.
One
must
admit
that
M.
Sorel
is
very
inexperienced
.
If
we
do
not
*NL*
succeed
in
saving
him
by
a
petition
for
a
reprieve
,
his
death
will
be
a
*NL*
kind
of
suicide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
was
careful
not
to
tell
Julien
a
matter
concerning
which
she
*NL*
had
now
no
longer
any
doubts
;
it
was
that
the
abbe
de
Frilair
seeing
*NL*
that
Julien
was
ruined
,
had
thought
that
it
would
further
his
ambitious
*NL*
projects
to
try
and
become
his
successor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
listen
to
a
mass
for
me
,
''
he
said
to
Mathilde
,
almost
beside
*NL*
himself
with
vexation
and
impotent
rage
,
and
leave
me
a
moment
in
*NL*
peace
.
Mathilde
who
was
already
very
jealous
of
madame
de
Renal
's
*NL*
visits
and
who
had
just
learned
of
her
departure
realised
the
cause
of
*NL*
Julien
's
bad
temper
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
grief
was
real
;
Julien
saw
this
and
was
only
the
more
irritated
.
He
*NL*
had
a
crying
need
of
solitude
,
and
how
was
he
to
get
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Eventually
Mathilde
,
after
having
tried
to
melt
him
by
every
possible
*NL*
argument
,
left
him
alone
.
But
almost
at
the
same
moment
,
Fouque
*NL*
presented
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
to
be
alone
,
''
he
said
,
to
this
faithful
friend
,
and
as
he
saw
*NL*
him
hesitate
:
``
I
am
composing
a
memorial
for
my
petition
for
pardon
...
*NL*
one
thing
more
...
do
me
a
favour
,
and
never
speak
to
me
about
death
.
*NL*
If
I
have
need
of
any
especial
services
on
that
day
,
let
me
be
the
*NL*
first
to
speak
to
you
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Julien
had
eventually
procured
solitude
,
he
found
himself
more
*NL*
prostrate
and
more
cowardly
than
he
had
been
before
.
The
little
force
*NL*
which
this
enfeebled
soul
still
possessed
had
all
been
spent
in
*NL*
concealing
his
condition
from
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
evening
he
found
consolation
in
this
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
at
the
very
moment
this
morning
,
when
death
seemed
so
ugly
to
*NL*
me
,
I
had
been
given
notice
of
my
execution
,
the
public
eye
would
*NL*
have
acted
as
a
spur
to
glory
,
my
demeanour
would
perhaps
have
had
a
*NL*
certain
stiffness
about
it
,
like
a
nervous
fop
entering
a
salon
.
A
few
*NL*
penetrating
people
,
if
there
are
any
amongst
these
provincial
might
*NL*
have
managed
to
divine
my
weakness
...
But
no
one
would
have
seen
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
felt
relieved
of
part
of
his
unhappiness
.
``
I
am
a
coward
at
this
*NL*
very
moment
,
''
he
sang
to
himself
,
``
but
no
one
will
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
even
more
unpleasant
episode
awaited
him
on
the
following
day
.
His
*NL*
father
had
been
announcing
that
he
would
come
and
see
him
for
some
time
*NL*
past
:
the
old
white-haired
carpenter
appeared
in
Julien
's
cell
before
*NL*
he
woke
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
felt
weak
,
he
was
anticipating
the
most
unpleasant
reproaches
.
*NL*
His
painful
emotion
was
intensified
by
the
fact
that
on
this
particular
*NL*
morning
he
felt
a
keen
remorse
for
not
loving
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chance
placed
us
next
to
each
other
in
the
world
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
while
the
turnkey
was
putting
the
cell
a
little
in
order
,
``
and
we
have
*NL*
practically
done
each
other
all
the
harm
we
possibly
could
.
He
has
come
*NL*
to
administer
the
final
blow
at
the
moment
of
my
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
were
without
witnesses
,
the
old
man
commenced
his
stern
*NL*
reproaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
could
not
restrain
his
tears
.
``
What
an
unworthy
weakness
,
''
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
querulously
.
``
He
will
go
about
everywhere
exaggerating
*NL*
my
lack
of
courage
:
what
a
triumph
for
the
Valenod
,
and
for
all
the
*NL*
fatuous
hypocrites
who
rule
in
Verrieres
!
They
are
very
great
in
*NL*
France
,
they
combine
all
the
social
advantages
.
But
hitherto
,
I
could
*NL*
at
any
rate
say
to
myself
,
it
is
true
they
are
in
receipt
of
money
,
and
*NL*
that
all
the
honours
lavished
on
them
,
but
I
have
a
noble
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
here
is
a
witness
whom
everyone
will
believe
,
and
who
will
testify
*NL*
to
the
whole
of
Verrieres
that
I
shewed
weakness
when
confronted
with
*NL*
death
,
and
who
will
exaggerate
it
into
the
bargain
!
I
shall
be
taken
*NL*
for
a
coward
in
an
ordeal
which
comes
home
to
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
was
nearly
desperate
.
He
did
not
know
how
to
get
rid
of
his
*NL*
father
.
He
felt
it
absolutely
beyond
his
strength
to
invent
a
ruse
*NL*
capable
of
deceiving
so
shrewd
an
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
rapidly
reviewed
all
the
alternatives
.
``
I
have
saved
some
*NL*
money
,
''
he
suddenly
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
inspiration
produced
a
change
in
the
expression
of
the
old
man
and
*NL*
in
Julien
's
own
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
ought
I
to
dispose
of
it
?
''
continued
Julien
more
quietly
.
The
*NL*
result
had
freed
him
from
any
feeling
of
inferiority
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
carpenter
was
burning
not
to
let
the
money
slip
by
him
,
but
*NL*
it
seemed
that
Julien
wanted
to
leave
part
of
it
to
his
brothers
.
He
*NL*
talked
at
length
and
with
animation
.
Julien
felt
cynical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
Lord
has
given
me
a
message
with
regard
to
my
will
.
I
will
*NL*
give
a
thousand
francs
to
each
of
my
brothers
and
the
rest
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
``
The
rest
is
due
to
me
:
but
since
God
*NL*
has
been
gracious
enough
to
touch
your
heart
,
your
debts
ought
to
be
*NL*
paid
if
you
wish
to
die
like
a
good
Christian
.
There
are
,
moreover
,
the
*NL*
expenses
of
your
board
and
your
education
,
which
I
advanced
to
you
,
*NL*
but
which
you
are
not
thinking
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
is
paternal
love
,
''
repeated
Julien
to
himself
,
dejectedly
,
when
*NL*
he
was
at
last
alone
.
Soon
the
gaoler
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
I
always
bring
my
visitors
a
good
bottle
of
champagne
after
*NL*
near
relations
have
come
to
see
them
.
It
is
a
little
dear
,
six
francs
a
*NL*
bottle
,
but
it
rejoices
the
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
three
glasses
,
''
said
Julien
to
him
,
with
a
childish
eagerness
,
*NL*
``
and
bring
in
two
of
the
prisoners
whom
I
have
heard
walking
about
*NL*
in
the
corridor
.
''
The
gaoler
brought
two
men
into
him
who
had
once
*NL*
been
condemned
to
the
gallows
,
and
had
now
been
convicted
of
the
same
*NL*
offence
again
,
and
were
preparing
to
return
to
penal
servitude
.
They
*NL*
were
very
cheerful
scoundrels
,
and
really
very
remarkable
by
reason
of
*NL*
their
subtlety
,
their
courage
,
and
their
coolness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
give
me
twenty
francs
,
''
said
one
of
them
to
Julien
,
``
I
will
*NL*
tell
you
the
story
of
my
life
in
detail
.
It
's
rich
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
lie
,
''
said
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
me
,
''
he
answered
,
``
my
friend
there
,
who
is
jealous
of
my
twenty
*NL*
francs
will
give
me
away
if
I
say
anything
untrue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
history
was
atrocious
.
It
was
evidence
of
a
courageous
heart
which
*NL*
had
only
one
passion
--
that
of
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
their
departure
Julien
was
no
longer
the
same
man
.
All
his
anger
*NL*
with
himself
had
disappeared
.
The
awful
grief
which
had
been
poisoned
*NL*
and
rendered
more
acute
by
the
weakness
of
which
he
had
been
a
victim
*NL*
since
madame
de
Renal
's
departure
had
turned
to
melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
been
less
taken
in
by
appearances
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
*NL*
would
have
had
a
better
chance
of
seeing
that
the
Paris
salons
are
full
*NL*
of
honest
men
like
my
father
,
or
clever
scoundrels
like
those
felons
.
*NL*
They
are
right
.
The
men
in
the
salons
never
get
up
in
the
morning
with
*NL*
this
poignant
thought
in
their
minds
,
how
am
I
going
to
get
my
dinner
?
*NL*
They
boast
about
their
honesty
and
when
they
are
summoned
on
the
jury
,
*NL*
they
take
pride
in
convicting
the
man
who
has
stolen
a
silver
dish
*NL*
because
he
felt
starving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
there
is
a
court
,
and
it
's
a
question
of
losing
or
winning
a
*NL*
portfolio
,
my
worthy
salon
people
will
commit
crimes
exactly
similar
to
*NL*
those
,
which
the
need
of
getting
a
dinner
inspired
those
two
felons
to
*NL*
perpetrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
such
thing
as
natural
law
,
the
expression
is
nothing
*NL*
more
than
a
silly
anachronism
well
worthy
of
the
advocate-general
who
*NL*
harried
me
the
other
day
,
and
whose
grandfather
was
enriched
by
one
of
*NL*
the
confiscations
of
Louis
XIV
.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
right
,
except
*NL*
when
there
is
a
law
to
forbid
a
certain
thing
under
pain
of
punishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
law
existed
,
the
only
natural
thing
was
the
strength
of
the
*NL*
lion
,
or
the
need
of
a
creature
who
was
cold
or
hungry
,
to
put
it
*NL*
in
one
word
,
need
.
No
,
the
people
whom
the
world
honours
are
merely
*NL*
villains
who
have
had
the
good
fortune
not
to
have
been
caught
*NL*
red-handed
.
The
prosecutor
whom
society
put
on
my
track
was
enriched
by
*NL*
an
infamous
act
.
I
have
committed
a
murder
,
and
I
am
justly
condemned
,
*NL*
but
the
Valenod
who
has
condemned
me
,
is
by
reason
alone
of
that
very
*NL*
deed
,
a
hundred
times
more
harmful
to
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
added
Julien
sadly
but
not
angrily
,
``
in
spite
of
his
avarice
,
*NL*
my
father
is
worth
more
than
all
those
men
.
He
never
loved
me
.
*NL*
The
disgrace
I
bring
upon
him
by
an
infamous
death
has
proved
the
*NL*
last
straw
.
That
fear
of
lacking
money
,
that
distorted
view
of
the
*NL*
wickedness
of
mankind
,
which
is
called
avarice
,
make
him
find
a
*NL*
tremendous
consolation
and
sense
of
security
in
a
sum
of
three
or
four
*NL*
hundred
louis
,
which
I
have
been
able
to
leave
him
.
Some
Sunday
,
after
*NL*
dinner
,
he
will
shew
his
gold
to
all
the
envious
men
in
Verrieres
.
*NL*
`
Which
of
you
would
not
be
delighted
to
have
a
son
guillotined
at
a
*NL*
price
like
this

will
be
the
message
they
will
read
in
his
eyes

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
philosophy
might
be
true
,
but
it
was
of
such
a
character
as
to
*NL*
make
him
wish
for
death
.
In
this
way
five
long
days
went
by
.
He
was
*NL*
polite
and
gentle
to
Mathilde
,
whom
he
saw
was
exasperated
by
the
*NL*
most
violent
jealousy
.
One
evening
Julien
seriously
thought
of
taking
*NL*
his
own
life
.
His
soul
was
demoralised
by
the
deep
unhappiness
in
*NL*
which
madame
de
Renal
's
departure
had
thrown
him
.
He
could
no
longer
*NL*
find
pleasure
in
anything
,
either
in
real
life
or
in
the
sphere
of
*NL*
the
imagination
.
Lack
of
exercise
began
to
affect
his
health
,
and
*NL*
to
produce
in
him
all
the
weakness
and
exaltation
of
a
young
German
*NL*
student
.
He
began
to
lose
that
virile
disdain
which
repels
with
a
*NL*
drastic
oath
certain
undignified
ideas
which
besiege
the
soul
of
the
*NL*
unhappy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
loved
truth
...
Where
is
it
?
Hypocrisy
everywhere
or
at
any
rate
*NL*
charlatanism
.
Even
in
the
most
virtuous
,
even
in
the
greatest
,
''
and
his
*NL*
lips
assumed
an
expression
of
disgust
.
``
No

man
can
not
trust

*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame

when
she
was
making

poor

*NL*
used
to
tell
me

such
a
prince
had
just
given
ten
louis

a
*NL*
sheer
lie

But
what

I
talking
about

Napoleon

''
*NL*
*NL*
Fouque
was
impatiently
waiting
for
this
suggestion
.
Julien
acquitted
*NL*
himself
becomingly
of
all
the
duty
a
man
owes
to
provincial
opinion
.
*NL*
Thanks
to
M.
the
abbe
de
Frilair
,
and
in
spite
of
his
bad
choice
of
a
*NL*
confessor
,
Julien
enjoyed
in
his
cell
the
protection
of
the
priestly
*NL*
congregation
;
with
a
little
more
diplomacy
he
might
have
managed
to
*NL*
escape
.
But
the
bad
air
of
the
cell
produced
its
effect
,
and
his
*NL*
strength
of
mind
diminished
.
But
this
only
intensified
his
happiness
at
*NL*
madame
de
Renal
's
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
first
duty
is
towards
you

she
said
as
she
embraced
him
;
*NL*
``
I
have
run
away
from

*NL*
*NL*
Julien
felt
no
petty
vanity
in
his
relations
with
her
,
and
told
her
all
*NL*
his
weaknesses
.
She
was
good
and
charming
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
she
had
scarcely
left
the
prison
before
she
made
the
*NL*
priest
,
who
had
clung
on
to
Julien
like
a
veritable
prey
,
go
to
her
*NL*
aunt
's
:
as
his
only
object
was
to
win
prestige
among
the
young
women
*NL*
who
belonged
to
good
Besancon
society
,
madame
de
Renal
easily
prevailed
*NL*
upon
him
to
go
and
perform
a
novena
at
the
abbey
of
Bray-le-Haut
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
words
can
do
justice
to
the
madness
and
extravagance
of
Julien
's
*NL*
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
means
of
gold
,
and
by
using
and
abusing
the
influence
of
her
aunt
,
*NL*
who
was
devout
,
rich
and
well-known
,
madame
de
Renal
managed
to
see
him
*NL*
twice
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
news
,
Mathilde
's
jealousy
reached
a
pitch
of
positive
madness
.
*NL*
M.
de
Frilair
had
confessed
to
her
that
all
his
influence
did
not
go
*NL*
so
far
as
to
admit
of
flouting
the
conventions
by
allowing
her
to
*NL*
see
her
sweetheart
more
than
once
every
day
.
Mathilde
had
madame
de
*NL*
Renal
followed
so
as
to
know
the
smallest
thing
she
did
.
M.
de
Frilair
*NL*
exhausted
all
the
resources
of
an
extremely
clever
intellect
in
order
*NL*
to
prove
to
her
that
Julien
was
unworthy
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Plunged
though
she
was
in
all
these
torments
,
she
only
loved
him
the
*NL*
more
,
and
made
a
horrible
scene
nearly
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
wished
,
with
all
his
might
,
to
behave
to
the
very
end
like
an
*NL*
honourable
man
towards
this
poor
young
girl
whom
he
had
so
strangely
*NL*
compromised
,
but
the
reckless
love
which
he
felt
for
madame
de
Renal
*NL*
swept
him
away
at
every
single
minute
.
When
he
could
not
manage
to
*NL*
persuade
Mathilde
of
the
innocence
of
her
rival
's
visits
by
all
his
*NL*
thin
excuses
,
he
would
say
to
himself
:
``
at
any
rate
the
end
of
the
*NL*
drama
ought
to
be
quite
near
.
The
very
fact
of
not
being
able
to
lie
*NL*
better
will
be
an
excuse
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
La
Mole
learnt
of
the
death
of
the
marquis
de
*NL*
Croisenois
.
The
rich
M.
de
Thaler
had
indulged
in
some
unpleasant
*NL*
remarks
concerning
Mathilde
's
disappearance
:
M.
de
Croisenois
went
*NL*
and
asked
him
to
recant
them
:
M.
de
Thaler
showed
him
some
anonymous
*NL*
letters
which
had
been
sent
to
him
,
and
which
were
full
of
details
so
*NL*
artfully
put
together
that
the
poor
marquis
could
not
help
catching
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Thaler
indulged
in
some
jests
which
were
devoid
of
all
taste
.
*NL*
Maddened
by
anger
and
unhappiness
,
M.
de
Croisenois
demanded
such
*NL*
unqualified
satisfaction
,
that
the
millionaire
preferred
to
fight
a
*NL*
duel
.
Stupidity
triumphed
,
and
one
of
the
most
lovable
of
men
met
with
*NL*
his
death
before
he
was
twenty-four
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
death
produced
a
strange
and
morbid
impression
on
Julien
's
*NL*
demoralised
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Croisenois
,
''
he
said
to
Mathilde
,
``
really
behaved
very
reasonably
*NL*
and
very
honourably
towards
us
;
he
had
ample
ground
for
hating
me
and
*NL*
picking
a
quarrel
with
me
,
by
reason
of
your
indiscretion
in
your
*NL*
mother
's
salon
;
for
the
hatred
which
follows
on
contempt
is
usually
*NL*
frenzied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Croisenois
'
death
changed
all
Julien
's
ideas
concerning
*NL*
Mathilde
's
future
.
He
spent
several
days
in
proving
to
her
that
she
*NL*
ought
to
accept
the
hand
of
M.
de
Luz
.
``
He
is
a
nervous
man
,
not
too
*NL*
much
of
a
Jesuit
,
and
will
doubtless
be
a
candidate
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
*NL*
``
He
has
a
more
sinister
and
persevering
ambition
than
poor
Croisenois
,
*NL*
and
as
there
has
never
been
a
dukedom
in
his
family
,
he
will
be
only
*NL*
too
glad
to
marry
Julien
Sorel

widow

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
widow
,
though
,
who
scorns
the
grand
passions

''
answered
Mathilde
*NL*
coldly
,
``
for
she
has
lived
long
enough
to
see
her
lover
prefer
to
*NL*
her
after
six
months
another
woman

the
origin
of
all
their
*NL*
unhappiness

impotent

and
hopeless

even

was

-RRB-
,
coupled
with
her
shame
and
anguish
at
loving
this
unfaithful
*NL*
lover
more
than
ever
had
plunged
mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
into
a
gloomy
*NL*
silence
,
from
which
all
the
careful
assiduity
of
M.
de
Frilair
was
as
*NL*
little
able
to
draw
her
as
the
rugged
frankness
of
Fouque
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Julien
,
except
in
those
moments
which
were
taken
up
by
*NL*
Mathilde
's
presence
,
he
lived
on
love
with
scarcely
a
thought
for
the
*NL*
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
former
days
,
''
Julien
said
to
her
,
``
when
I
might
have
been
so
happy
,
*NL*
during
our
walks
in
the
wood
of
Vergy
,
a
frenzied
ambition
swept
my
*NL*
soul
into
the
realms
of
imagination
.
Instead
of
pressing
to
my
heart
*NL*
that
charming
arm
which
is
so
near
my
lips
,
the
thoughts
of
my
future
*NL*
took
me
away
from
you

I
was
engaged
in
countless
combats
which
I
*NL*
should
have
to
sustain
in
order
to
lay
the
foundations
of
a
colossal
*NL*
fortune

No

I
should
have
died
without
knowing
what
happiness
was
if
*NL*
you
had
not
come
to
see
me
in
this
prison

''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
episodes
ruffled
this
tranquil
life
.
Julien
's
confessor
,
Jansenist
*NL*
though
he
was
,
was
not
proof
against
an
intrigue
of
the
Jesuits
,
and
*NL*
became
their
tool
without
knowing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
to
tell
him
one
day
that
unless
he
meant
to
fall
into
the
awful
*NL*
sin
of
suicide
,
he
ought
to
take
every
possible
step
to
procure
his
*NL*
pardon
.
Consequently
,
as
the
clergy
have
a
great
deal
of
influence
with
*NL*
the
minister
of
Justice
at
Paris
,
an
easy
means
presented
itself
;
he
*NL*
ought
to
become
converted
with
all
publicity

Ha
!
I
have
caught
you
at
it
--
I
*NL*
have
caught
you
as
well
,
my
father
,
playing
a
part
like
any
missionary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
youth
,
''
replied
the
Jansenist
gravely
,
``
the
interesting
*NL*
appearance
which
Providence
has
given
you
,
the
still
unsolved
mystery
*NL*
of
the
motive
for
your
crime
,
the
heroic
steps
which
mademoiselle
de
*NL*
la
Mole
has
so
freely
taken
on
your
behalf
,
everything
,
up
to
the
*NL*
surprising
affection
which
your
victim
manifests
towards
you
,
has
*NL*
contributed
to
make
you
the
hero
of
the
young
women
of
Besancon
.
*NL*
They
have
forgotten
everything
,
even
politics
,
on
your
account
.
Your
*NL*
conversion
will
reverberate
in
their
hearts
and
will
leave
behind
it
a
*NL*
deep
impression
.
You
can
be
of
considerable
use
to
religion
,
and
I
was
*NL*
about
to
hesitate
for
the
trivial
reason
that
in
a
similar
circumstance
*NL*
the
Jesuits
would
follow
a
similar
course
.
But
if
I
did
,
even
in
the
*NL*
one
case
which
has
escaped
their
greedy
clutches
they
would
still
be
*NL*
exercising
their
mischief
.
The
tears
which
your
conversation
will
*NL*
cause
to
be
shed
will
annul
the
poisonous
effect
of
ten
editions
of
*NL*
Voltaire
's
works
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
will
be
left
for
me
,
''
answered
Julien
,
coldly
,
``
if
I
despise
*NL*
myself
?
I
have
been
ambitious
;
I
do
not
mean
to
blame
myself
in
any
*NL*
way
.
Further
,
I
have
acted
in
accordance
with
the
code
of
the
age
.
Now
*NL*
I
am
living
from
day
to
day
.
But
I
should
make
myself
very
unhappy
*NL*
if
I
were
to
yield
to
what
the
locality
would
regard
as
a
piece
of
*NL*
cowardice
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
was
responsible
for
the
other
episode
which
affected
*NL*
Julien
in
quite
another
way
.
Some
intriguing
woman
friend
or
other
had
*NL*
managed
to
persuade
this
naive
and
timid
soul
that
it
was
her
duty
*NL*
to
leave
for
St.
Cloud
,
and
go
and
throw
herself
at
the
feet
of
King
*NL*
Charles
X
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
made
the
sacrifice
of
separating
from
Julien
,
and
after
*NL*
a
strain
as
great
as
that
,
she
no
longer
thought
anything
of
the
*NL*
unpleasantness
of
making
an
exhibition
of
herself
,
though
in
former
*NL*
times
she
would
have
thought
that
worse
than
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
to
the
king
.
I
will
confess
freely
that
you
are
my
lover
.
*NL*
The
life
of
a
man
,
and
of
a
man
like
Julien
,
too
,
ought
to
prevail
over
*NL*
every
consideration
.
I
will
tell
him
that
it
was
because
of
jealousy
*NL*
that
you
made
an
attempt
upon
my
life
.
There
are
numerous
instances
of
*NL*
poor
young
people
who
have
been
saved
in
such
a
case
by
the
clemency
of
*NL*
the
jury
or
of
the
king
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
leave
off
seeing
you
;
I
will
shut
myself
up
in
my
prison
,
''
*NL*
exclaimed
Julien
,
``
and
you
can
be
quite
certain
that
if
you
do
not
*NL*
promise
me
to
take
no
step
which
will
make
a
public
exhibition
of
us
*NL*
both
,
I
will
kill
myself
in
despair
the
day
afterwards
.
This
idea
of
*NL*
going
to
Paris
is
not
your
own
.
Tell
me
the
name
of
the
intriguing
*NL*
woman
who
suggested
it
to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
be
happy
during
the
small
number
of
days
of
this
short
life
.
*NL*
Let
us
hide
our
existence
;
my
crime
was
only
too
self-evident
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
la
Mole
enjoys
all
possible
influence
at
Paris
.
Take
*NL*
it
from
me
that
she
has
done
all
that
is
humanly
possible
.
Here
in
*NL*
the
provinces
I
have
all
the
men
of
wealth
and
prestige
against
me
.
*NL*
Your
conduct
will
still
further
aggravate
those
rich
and
essentially
*NL*
moderate
people
to
whom
life
comes
so
easy
...
Let
us
not
give
the
*NL*
Maslons
,
the
Valenods
,
and
the
thousand
other
people
who
are
worth
more
*NL*
than
they
,
anything
to
laugh
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
came
to
find
the
bad
air
of
the
cell
unbearable
.
Fortunately
,
*NL*
nature
was
rejoicing
in
a
fine
sunshine
on
the
day
when
they
announced
*NL*
to
him
that
he
would
have
to
die
,
and
he
was
in
a
courageous
vein
.
*NL*
He
found
walking
in
the
open
air
as
delicious
a
sensation
as
the
*NL*
navigator
,
who
has
been
at
sea
for
a
long
time
,
finds
walking
on
the
*NL*
ground
.
``
Come
on
,
everything
is
going
all
right
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
``
I
am
not
lacking
in
courage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
had
never
looked
so
poetical
as
at
that
moment
when
it
was
on
*NL*
the
point
of
falling
.
The
sweet
minutes
which
he
had
formerly
spent
in
*NL*
the
woods
of
Vergy
crowded
back
upon
his
mind
with
extreme
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
went
off
simply
,
decorously
,
and
without
any
affectation
on
*NL*
his
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
before
he
had
said
to
Fouque
:
``
I
can
not
guarantee
not
to
*NL*
show
some
emotion
.
This
dense
,
squalid
cell
gives
me
fits
of
fever
in
*NL*
which
I
do
not
recognise
myself
,
but
fear
?
--
no
!
I
shall
not
be
seen
to
*NL*
flinch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
made
his
arrangements
in
advance
for
Fouque
to
take
Mathilde
and
*NL*
madame
de
Renal
away
on
the
morning
of
his
last
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drive
them
away
in
the
same
carriage
,
''
he
had
said
.
``
Do
you
see
that
*NL*
the
post-horses
do
not
leave
off
galloping
.
They
will
either
fall
into
*NL*
each
other
's
arms
,
or
manifest
towards
each
other
a
mortal
hatred
.
*NL*
In
either
case
the
poor
women
will
have
something
to
distract
them
a
*NL*
little
from
their
awful
grief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julien
had
made
madame
de
Renal
swear
that
she
would
live
to
look
after
*NL*
Mathilde
's
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
knows
?
Perhaps
we
have
still
some
sensations
after
our
death
,
''
he
*NL*
had
said
one
day
to
Fouque
.
``
I
should
like
to
rest
,
for
rest
is
the
*NL*
right
word
,
in
that
little
grotto
in
the
great
mountain
which
dominates
*NL*
Verrieres
.
Many
a
time
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
I
have
spent
the
night
*NL*
alone
in
that
grotto
,
and
as
my
gaze
would
plunge
far
and
wide
over
the
*NL*
richest
provinces
of
France
,
ambition
would
inflame
my
heart
.
In
those
*NL*
days
it
was
my
passion
...
Anyway
,
I
hold
that
grotto
dear
,
and
one
*NL*
can
not
dispute
that
its
situation
might
well
arouse
the
desires
of
the
*NL*
philosopher
's
soul
...
Well
,
you
know
!
those
good
priests
of
Besancon
*NL*
will
make
money
out
of
everything
.
If
you
know
how
to
manage
it
,
they
*NL*
will
sell
you
my
mortal
remains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fouque
succeeded
in
this
melancholy
business
.
He
was
passing
the
night
*NL*
alone
in
his
room
by
his
friend
's
body
when
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
he
*NL*
saw
Mathilde
come
in
.
A
few
hours
before
he
had
left
her
ten
leagues
*NL*
from
Besancon
.
Her
face
and
eyes
looked
distraught
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
him
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fouque
had
not
the
courage
either
to
speak
or
get
up
.
He
pointed
with
*NL*
his
finger
to
a
big
blue
cloak
on
the
floor
;
there
was
wrapped
in
it
*NL*
all
that
remained
of
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
threw
herself
on
her
knees
.
The
memory
of
Boniface
de
la
Mole
,
and
*NL*
of
Marguerite
of
Navarre
gave
her
,
no
doubt
,
a
superhuman
courage
.
Her
*NL*
trembling
hands
undid
the
cloak
.
Fouque
turned
away
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
Mathilde
walking
feverishly
about
the
room
.
She
lit
several
*NL*
candles
.
When
Fouque
could
bring
himself
to
look
at
her
,
she
had
placed
*NL*
Julien
's
head
on
a
little
marble
table
in
front
of
her
,
and
was
kissing
*NL*
it
on
the
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
followed
her
lover
to
the
tomb
which
he
had
chosen
.
A
great
*NL*
number
of
priests
convoyed
the
bier
,
and
,
alone
in
her
draped
carriage
,
*NL*
without
anyone
knowing
it
,
she
carried
on
her
knees
the
head
of
the
man
*NL*
whom
she
had
loved
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
arrived
in
this
way
at
the
most
elevated
peak
of
the
high
*NL*
mountains
of
the
Jura
,
twenty
priests
celebrated
the
service
of
the
*NL*
dead
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
this
little
grotto
,
which
was
*NL*
magnificently
illuminated
by
a
countless
number
of
wax
candles
.
*NL*
Attracted
by
this
strange
and
singular
ceremony
,
all
the
inhabitants
*NL*
of
the
little
mountain
villages
which
the
funeral
had
passed
through
,
*NL*
followed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
appeared
in
their
midst
in
long
mourning
garments
,
and
had
*NL*
several
thousands
of
five-franc
pieces
thrown
to
them
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
left
alone
with
Fouque
,
she
insisted
on
burying
her
*NL*
lover
's
head
with
her
own
hands
.
Fouque
nearly
went
mad
with
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mathilde
took
care
that
this
wild
grotto
should
be
decorated
with
*NL*
marble
monuments
that
had
been
sculpted
in
Italy
at
great
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Renal
kept
her
promise
.
She
did
not
try
to
make
any
attempt
*NL*
upon
her
life
;
but
she
died
embracing
her
children
,
three
days
after
*NL*
Julien
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
END
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
inconvenience
of
the
reign
of
public
opinion
is
that
though
,
of
*NL*
course
,
it
secures
liberty
,
it
meddles
with
what
it
has
nothing
to
do
*NL*
with
--
private
life
,
for
example
.
Hence
the
gloominess
of
America
and
*NL*
England
.
In
order
to
avoid
infringing
on
private
life
,
the
author
has
*NL*
invented
a
little
town
--
Verrieres
,
and
when
he
had
need
of
a
bishop
,
*NL*
a
jury
,
an
assize
court
,
he
placed
all
this
in
Besancon
,
where
he
has
*NL*
never
been
.
