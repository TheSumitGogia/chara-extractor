The
date
at
which
the
following
events
are
assumed
to
have
occurred
*NL*
may
be
set
down
as
between
1840
and
1850
,
when
the
old
watering-place
*NL*
herein
called
``
Budmouth
''
still
retained
sufficient
afterglow
from
its
*NL*
Georgian
gaiety
and
prestige
to
lend
it
an
absorbing
attractiveness
to
*NL*
the
romantic
and
imaginative
soul
of
a
lonely
dweller
inland
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
general
name
of
``
Egdon
Heath
,
''
which
has
been
given
to
the
*NL*
sombre
scene
of
the
story
,
are
united
or
typified
heaths
of
various
*NL*
real
names
,
to
the
number
of
at
least
a
dozen
;
these
being
virtually
*NL*
one
in
character
and
aspect
,
though
their
original
unity
,
or
partial
*NL*
unity
,
is
now
somewhat
disguised
by
intrusive
strips
and
slices
*NL*
brought
under
the
plough
with
varying
degrees
of
success
,
or
planted
*NL*
to
woodland
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
pleasant
to
dream
that
some
spot
in
the
extensive
tract
whose
*NL*
south-western
quarter
is
here
described
,
may
be
the
heath
of
that
*NL*
traditionary
King
of
Wessex

Lear

POSTSCRIPT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
prevent
disappointment
to
searchers
for
scenery
it
should
be
added
*NL*
that
though
the
action
of
the
narrative
is
supposed
to
proceed
in
the
*NL*
central
and
most
secluded
part
of
the
heaths
united
into
one
whole
,
*NL*
as
above
described
,
certain
topographical
features
resembling
those
*NL*
delineated
really
lie
on
the
margin
of
the
waste
,
several
miles
to
the
*NL*
westward
of
the
centre
.
In
some
other
respects
also
there
has
been
a
*NL*
bringing
together
of
scattered
characteristics
.

THE
THREE
WOMEN

*NL*
*NL*
A
Face
on
Which
Time
Makes
But
Little
Impression
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
Saturday
afternoon
in
November
was
approaching
the
time
of
twilight
,
*NL*
and
the
vast
tract
of
unenclosed
wild
known
as
Egdon
Heath
embrowned
*NL*
itself
moment
by
moment
.
Overhead
the
hollow
stretch
of
whitish
cloud
*NL*
shutting
out
the
sky
was
as
a
tent
which
had
the
whole
heath
for
its
*NL*
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heaven
being
spread
with
this
pallid
screen
and
the
earth
with
*NL*
the
darkest
vegetation
,
their
meeting-line
at
the
horizon
was
*NL*
clearly
marked
.
In
such
contrast
the
heath
wore
the
appearance
of
*NL*
an
instalment
of
night
which
had
taken
up
its
place
before
its
*NL*
astronomical
hour
was
come
:
darkness
had
to
a
great
extent
arrived
*NL*
hereon
,
while
day
stood
distinct
in
the
sky
.
Looking
upwards
,
a
*NL*
furze-cutter
would
have
been
inclined
to
continue
work
;
looking
down
,
*NL*
he
would
have
decided
to
finish
his
faggot
and
go
home
.
The
distant
*NL*
rims
of
the
world
and
of
the
firmament
seemed
to
be
a
division
in
time
*NL*
no
less
than
a
division
in
matter
.
The
face
of
the
heath
by
its
mere
*NL*
complexion
added
half
an
hour
to
evening
;
it
could
in
like
manner
*NL*
retard
the
dawn
,
sadden
noon
,
anticipate
the
frowning
of
storms
*NL*
scarcely
generated
,
and
intensify
the
opacity
of
a
moonless
midnight
*NL*
to
a
cause
of
shaking
and
dread
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
precisely
at
this
transitional
point
of
its
nightly
roll
into
*NL*
darkness
the
great
and
particular
glory
of
the
Egdon
waste
began
,
and
*NL*
nobody
could
be
said
to
understand
the
heath
who
had
not
been
there
at
*NL*
such
a
time
.
It
could
best
be
felt
when
it
could
not
clearly
be
seen
,
*NL*
its
complete
effect
and
explanation
lying
in
this
and
the
succeeding
*NL*
hours
before
the
next
dawn
;
then
,
and
only
then
,
did
it
tell
its
true
*NL*
tale
.
The
spot
was
,
indeed
,
a
near
relation
of
night
,
and
when
night
*NL*
showed
itself
an
apparent
tendency
to
gravitate
together
could
be
*NL*
perceived
in
its
shades
and
the
scene
.
The
sombre
stretch
of
rounds
*NL*
and
hollows
seemed
to
rise
and
meet
the
evening
gloom
in
pure
*NL*
sympathy
,
the
heath
exhaling
darkness
as
rapidly
as
the
heavens
*NL*
precipitated
it
.
And
so
the
obscurity
in
the
air
and
the
obscurity
in
*NL*
the
land
closed
together
in
a
black
fraternization
towards
which
each
*NL*
advanced
half-way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
became
full
of
a
watchful
intentness
now
;
for
when
other
*NL*
things
sank
brooding
to
sleep
the
heath
appeared
slowly
to
awake
and
*NL*
listen
.
Every
night
its
Titanic
form
seemed
to
await
something
;
but
*NL*
it
had
waited
thus
,
unmoved
,
during
so
many
centuries
,
through
the
*NL*
crises
of
so
many
things
,
that
it
could
only
be
imagined
to
await
one
*NL*
last
crisis
--
the
final
overthrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
spot
which
returned
upon
the
memory
of
those
who
loved
it
*NL*
with
an
aspect
of
peculiar
and
kindly
congruity
.
Smiling
champaigns
of
*NL*
flowers
and
fruit
hardly
do
this
,
for
they
are
permanently
harmonious
*NL*
only
with
an
existence
of
better
reputation
as
to
its
issues
than
the
*NL*
present
.
Twilight
combined
with
the
scenery
of
Egdon
Heath
to
evolve
*NL*
a
thing
majestic
without
severity
,
impressive
without
showiness
,
*NL*
emphatic
in
its
admonitions
,
grand
in
its
simplicity
.
The
*NL*
qualifications
which
frequently
invest
the
facade
of
a
prison
with
far
*NL*
more
dignity
than
is
found
in
the
facade
of
a
palace
double
its
size
*NL*
lent
to
this
heath
a
sublimity
in
which
spots
renowned
for
beauty
of
*NL*
the
accepted
kind
are
utterly
wanting
.
Fair
prospects
wed
happily
*NL*
with
fair
times
;
but
alas
,
if
times
be
not
fair
!
Men
have
oftener
*NL*
suffered
from
the
mockery
of
a
place
too
smiling
for
their
reason
*NL*
than
from
the
oppression
of
surroundings
oversadly
tinged
.
Haggard
*NL*
Egdon
appealed
to
a
subtler
and
scarcer
instinct
,
to
a
more
recently
*NL*
learnt
emotion
,
than
that
which
responds
to
the
sort
of
beauty
called
*NL*
charming
and
fair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
it
is
a
question
if
the
exclusive
reign
of
this
orthodox
*NL*
beauty
is
not
approaching
its
last
quarter
.
The
new
Vale
of
Tempe
*NL*
may
be
a
gaunt
waste
in
Thule
;
human
souls
may
find
themselves
in
*NL*
closer
and
closer
harmony
with
external
things
wearing
a
sombreness
*NL*
distasteful
to
our
race
when
it
was
young
.
The
time
seems
near
,
if
it
*NL*
has
not
actually
arrived
,
when
the
chastened
sublimity
of
a
moor
,
a
*NL*
sea
,
or
a
mountain
will
be
all
of
nature
that
is
absolutely
in
keeping
*NL*
with
the
moods
of
the
more
thinking
among
mankind
.
And
ultimately
,
*NL*
to
the
commonest
tourist
,
spots
like
Iceland
may
become
what
the
*NL*
vineyards
and
myrtle-gardens
of
South
Europe
are
to
him
now
;
and
*NL*
Heidelberg
and
Baden
be
passed
unheeded
as
he
hastens
from
the
Alps
to
*NL*
the
sand-dunes
of
Scheveningen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
thorough-going
ascetic
could
feel
that
he
had
a
natural
right
*NL*
to
wander
on
Egdon
:
he
was
keeping
within
the
line
of
legitimate
*NL*
indulgence
when
he
laid
himself
open
to
influences
such
as
these
.
*NL*
Colours
and
beauties
so
far
subdued
were
,
at
least
,
the
birthright
of
*NL*
all
.
Only
in
summer
days
of
highest
feather
did
its
mood
touch
the
*NL*
level
of
gaiety
.
Intensity
was
more
usually
reached
by
way
of
the
*NL*
solemn
than
by
way
of
the
brilliant
,
and
such
a
sort
of
intensity
was
*NL*
often
arrived
at
during
winter
darkness
,
tempests
,
and
mists
.
Then
*NL*
Egdon
was
aroused
to
reciprocity
;
for
the
storm
was
its
lover
,
and
*NL*
the
wind
its
friend
.
Then
it
became
the
home
of
strange
phantoms
;
and
*NL*
it
was
found
to
be
the
hitherto
unrecognized
original
of
those
wild
*NL*
regions
of
obscurity
which
are
vaguely
felt
to
be
compassing
us
about
*NL*
in
midnight
dreams
of
flight
and
disaster
,
and
are
never
thought
of
*NL*
after
the
dream
till
revived
by
scenes
like
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
present
a
place
perfectly
accordant
with
man
's
*NL*
nature
--
neither
ghastly
,
hateful
,
nor
ugly
;
neither
commonplace
,
*NL*
unmeaning
,
nor
tame
;
but
,
like
man
,
slighted
and
enduring
;
and
withal
*NL*
singularly
colossal
and
mysterious
in
its
swarthy
monotony
.
As
with
*NL*
some
persons
who
have
long
lived
apart
,
solitude
seemed
to
look
*NL*
out
of
its
countenance
.
It
had
a
lonely
face
,
suggesting
tragical
*NL*
possibilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
obscure
,
obsolete
,
superseded
country
figures
in
Domesday
.
*NL*
Its
condition
is
recorded
therein
as
that
of
heathy
,
furzy
,
briary
*NL*
wilderness
--
``
Bruaria
.
''
Then
follows
the
length
and
breadth
in
*NL*
leagues
;
and
,
though
some
uncertainty
exists
as
to
the
exact
extent
of
*NL*
this
ancient
lineal
measure
,
it
appears
from
the
figures
that
the
area
*NL*
of
Egdon
down
to
the
present
day
has
but
little
diminished
.
``
Turbaria
*NL*
Bruaria
''
--
the
right
of
cutting
heath-turf
--
occurs
in
charters
relating
*NL*
to
the
district
.
``
Overgrown
with
heth
and
mosse
,
''
says
Leland
of
the
*NL*
same
dark
sweep
of
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
at
least
were
intelligible
facts
regarding
*NL*
landscape
--
far-reaching
proofs
productive
of
genuine
satisfaction
.
*NL*
The
untameable
,
Ishmaelitish
thing
that
Egdon
now
was
it
always
had
*NL*
been
.
Civilization
was
its
enemy
;
and
ever
since
the
beginning
of
*NL*
vegetation
its
soil
had
worn
the
same
antique
brown
dress
,
the
natural
*NL*
and
invariable
garment
of
the
particular
formation
.
In
its
venerable
*NL*
one
coat
lay
a
certain
vein
of
satire
on
human
vanity
in
clothes
.
A
*NL*
person
on
a
heath
in
raiment
of
modern
cut
and
colours
has
more
or
*NL*
less
an
anomalous
look
.
We
seem
to
want
the
oldest
and
simplest
human
*NL*
clothing
where
the
clothing
of
the
earth
is
so
primitive
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
recline
on
a
stump
of
thorn
in
the
central
valley
of
Egdon
,
between
*NL*
afternoon
and
night
,
as
now
,
where
the
eye
could
reach
nothing
of
the
*NL*
world
outside
the
summits
and
shoulders
of
heathland
which
filled
the
*NL*
whole
circumference
of
its
glance
,
and
to
know
that
everything
around
*NL*
and
underneath
had
been
from
prehistoric
times
as
unaltered
as
the
*NL*
stars
overhead
,
gave
ballast
to
the
mind
adrift
on
change
,
and
*NL*
harassed
by
the
irrepressible
New
.
The
great
inviolate
place
had
*NL*
an
ancient
permanence
which
the
sea
can
not
claim
.
Who
can
say
of
a
*NL*
particular
sea
that
it
is
old
?
Distilled
by
the
sun
,
kneaded
by
the
*NL*
moon
,
it
is
renewed
in
a
year
,
in
a
day
,
or
in
an
hour
.
The
sea
*NL*
changed
,
the
fields
changed
,
the
rivers
,
the
villages
,
and
the
people
*NL*
changed
,
yet
Egdon
remained
.
Those
surfaces
were
neither
so
steep
as
*NL*
to
be
destructible
by
weather
,
nor
so
flat
as
to
be
the
victims
of
*NL*
floods
and
deposits
.
With
the
exception
of
an
aged
highway
,
and
a
*NL*
still
more
aged
barrow
presently
to
be
referred
to
--
themselves
almost
*NL*
crystallized
to
natural
products
by
long
continuance
--
even
the
*NL*
trifling
irregularities
were
not
caused
by
pickaxe
,
plough
,
or
spade
,
*NL*
but
remained
as
the
very
finger-touches
of
the
last
geological
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
above-mentioned
highway
traversed
the
lower
levels
of
the
heath
,
*NL*
from
one
horizon
to
another
.
In
many
portions
of
its
course
it
*NL*
overlaid
an
old
vicinal
way
,
which
branched
from
the
great
Western
*NL*
road
of
the
Romans
,
the
Via
Iceniana
,
or
Ikenild
Street
,
hard
by
.
*NL*
On
the
evening
under
consideration
it
would
have
been
noticed
that
,
*NL*
though
the
gloom
had
increased
sufficiently
to
confuse
the
minor
*NL*
features
of
the
heath
,
the
white
surface
of
the
road
remained
almost
*NL*
as
clear
as
ever
.

II
*NL*
*NL*
Humanity
Appears
upon
the
Scene
,
Hand
in
Hand
with
Trouble
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Along
the
road
walked
an
old
man
.
He
was
white-headed
as
a
mountain
,
*NL*
bowed
in
the
shoulders
,
and
faded
in
general
aspect
.
He
wore
a
*NL*
glazed
hat
,
an
ancient
boat-cloak
,
and
shoes
;
his
brass
buttons
*NL*
bearing
an
anchor
upon
their
face
.
In
his
hand
was
a
silver-headed
*NL*
walking-stick
,
which
he
used
as
a
veritable
third
leg
,
perseveringly
*NL*
dotting
the
ground
with
its
point
at
every
few
inches
'
interval
.
One
*NL*
would
have
said
that
he
had
been
,
in
his
day
,
a
naval
officer
of
some
*NL*
sort
or
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
him
stretched
the
long
,
laborious
road
,
dry
,
empty
,
and
white
.
*NL*
It
was
quite
open
to
the
heath
on
each
side
,
and
bisected
that
*NL*
vast
dark
surface
like
the
parting-line
on
a
head
of
black
hair
,
*NL*
diminishing
and
bending
away
on
the
furthest
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
frequently
stretched
his
eyes
ahead
to
gaze
over
the
tract
*NL*
that
he
had
yet
to
traverse
.
At
length
he
discerned
,
a
long
distance
*NL*
in
front
of
him
,
a
moving
spot
,
which
appeared
to
be
a
vehicle
,
and
*NL*
it
proved
to
be
going
the
same
way
as
that
in
which
he
himself
was
*NL*
journeying
.
It
was
the
single
atom
of
life
that
the
scene
contained
,
*NL*
and
it
only
served
to
render
the
general
loneliness
more
evident
.
Its
*NL*
rate
of
advance
was
slow
,
and
the
old
man
gained
upon
it
sensibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
drew
nearer
he
perceived
it
to
be
a
spring
van
,
ordinary
in
*NL*
shape
,
but
singular
in
colour
,
this
being
a
lurid
red
.
The
driver
*NL*
walked
beside
it
;
and
,
like
his
van
,
he
was
completely
red
.
One
dye
*NL*
of
that
tincture
covered
his
clothes
,
the
cap
upon
his
head
,
his
*NL*
boots
,
his
face
,
and
his
hands
.
He
was
not
temporarily
overlaid
with
*NL*
the
colour
;
it
permeated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
knew
the
meaning
of
this
.
The
traveller
with
the
cart
*NL*
was
a
reddleman
--
a
person
whose
vocation
it
was
to
supply
farmers
*NL*
with
redding
for
their
sheep
.
He
was
one
of
a
class
rapidly
becoming
*NL*
extinct
in
Wessex
,
filling
at
present
in
the
rural
world
the
place
*NL*
which
,
during
the
last
century
,
the
dodo
occupied
in
the
world
of
*NL*
animals
.
He
is
a
curious
,
interesting
,
and
nearly
perished
link
*NL*
between
obsolete
forms
of
life
and
those
which
generally
prevail
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
decayed
officer
,
by
degrees
,
came
up
alongside
his
*NL*
fellow-wayfarer
,
and
wished
him
good
evening
.
The
reddleman
turned
*NL*
his
head
,
and
replied
in
sad
and
occupied
tones
.
He
was
young
,
and
*NL*
his
face
,
if
not
exactly
handsome
,
approached
so
near
to
handsome
that
*NL*
nobody
would
have
contradicted
an
assertion
that
it
really
was
so
in
*NL*
its
natural
colour
.
His
eye
,
which
glared
so
strangely
through
his
*NL*
stain
,
was
in
itself
attractive
--
keen
as
that
of
a
bird
of
prey
,
and
*NL*
blue
as
autumn
mist
.
He
had
neither
whisker
nor
moustache
,
which
*NL*
allowed
the
soft
curves
of
the
lower
part
of
his
face
to
be
apparent
.
*NL*
His
lips
were
thin
,
and
though
,
as
it
seemed
,
compressed
by
thought
,
*NL*
there
was
a
pleasant
twitch
at
their
corners
now
and
then
.
He
was
*NL*
clothed
throughout
in
a
tight-fitting
suit
of
corduroy
,
excellent
in
*NL*
quality
,
not
much
worn
,
and
well-chosen
for
its
purpose
,
but
deprived
*NL*
of
its
original
colour
by
his
trade
.
It
showed
to
advantage
the
good
*NL*
shape
of
his
figure
.
A
certain
well-to-do
air
about
the
man
suggested
*NL*
that
he
was
not
poor
for
his
degree
.
The
natural
query
of
an
observer
*NL*
would
have
been
,
Why
should
such
a
promising
being
as
this
have
hidden
*NL*
his
prepossessing
exterior
by
adopting
that
singular
occupation
?
*NL*
*NL*
After
replying
to
the
old
man
's
greeting
he
showed
no
inclination
to
*NL*
continue
in
talk
,
although
they
still
walked
side
by
side
,
for
the
*NL*
elder
traveller
seemed
to
desire
company
.
There
were
no
sounds
but
*NL*
that
of
the
booming
wind
upon
the
stretch
of
tawny
herbage
around
*NL*
them
,
the
crackling
wheels
,
the
tread
of
the
men
,
and
the
footsteps
*NL*
of
the
two
shaggy
ponies
which
drew
the
van
.
They
were
small
,
hardy
*NL*
animals
,
of
a
breed
between
Galloway
and
Exmoor
,
and
were
known
as
*NL*
``
heath-croppers
''
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
they
thus
pursued
their
way
,
the
reddleman
occasionally
left
*NL*
his
companion
's
side
,
and
,
stepping
behind
the
van
,
looked
into
its
*NL*
interior
through
a
small
window
.
The
look
was
always
anxious
.
He
*NL*
would
then
return
to
the
old
man
,
who
made
another
remark
about
*NL*
the
state
of
the
country
and
so
on
,
to
which
the
reddleman
again
*NL*
abstractedly
replied
,
and
then
again
they
would
lapse
into
silence
.
*NL*
The
silence
conveyed
to
neither
any
sense
of
awkwardness
;
in
these
*NL*
lonely
places
wayfarers
,
after
a
first
greeting
,
frequently
plod
on
*NL*
for
miles
without
speech
;
contiguity
amounts
to
a
tacit
conversation
*NL*
where
,
otherwise
than
in
cities
,
such
contiguity
can
be
put
an
end
*NL*
to
on
the
merest
inclination
,
and
where
not
to
put
an
end
to
it
is
*NL*
intercourse
in
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Possibly
these
two
might
not
have
spoken
again
till
their
parting
,
had
*NL*
it
not
been
for
the
reddleman
's
visits
to
his
van
.
When
he
returned
*NL*
from
his
fifth
time
of
looking
in
the
old
man
said
,
``
You
have
*NL*
something
inside
there
besides
your
load
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody
who
wants
looking
after
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
this
a
faint
cry
sounded
from
the
interior
.
The
*NL*
reddleman
hastened
to
the
back
,
looked
in
,
and
came
away
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
child
there
,
my
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
I
have
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce
you
have
!
Why
did
she
cry
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
has
fallen
asleep
,
and
not
being
used
to
traveling
,
she
's
*NL*
uneasy
,
and
keeps
dreaming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
young
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
have
interested
me
forty
years
ago
.
Perhaps
she
's
your
*NL*
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wife
!
''
said
the
other
bitterly
.
``
She
's
above
mating
with
such
as
*NL*
I
.
But
there
's
no
reason
why
I
should
tell
you
about
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
.
And
there
's
no
reason
why
you
should
not
.
What
harm
*NL*
can
I
do
to
you
or
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
looked
in
the
old
man
's
face
.
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
he
said
at
*NL*
last
,
``
I
knew
her
before
today
,
though
perhaps
it
would
have
been
*NL*
better
if
I
had
not
.
But
she
's
nothing
to
me
,
and
I
am
nothing
to
*NL*
her
;
and
she
would
n't
have
been
in
my
van
if
any
better
carriage
had
*NL*
been
there
to
take
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
,
may
I
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Anglebury
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
the
town
well
.
What
was
she
doing
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
much
--
to
gossip
about
.
However
,
she
's
tired
to
death
now
,
*NL*
and
not
at
all
well
,
and
that
's
what
makes
her
so
restless
.
She
*NL*
dropped
off
into
a
nap
about
an
hour
ago
,
and
`
twill
do
her
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice-looking
girl
,
no
doubt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
traveller
turned
his
eyes
with
interest
towards
the
van
*NL*
window
,
and
,
without
withdrawing
them
,
said
,
``
I
presume
I
might
look
*NL*
in
upon
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
reddleman
abruptly
.
``
It
is
getting
too
dark
for
you
to
*NL*
see
much
of
her
;
and
,
more
than
that
,
I
have
no
right
to
allow
you
.
*NL*
Thank
God
she
sleeps
so
well
:
I
hope
she
wo
n't
wake
till
she
's
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
she
?
One
of
the
neighbourhood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
no
matter
who
,
excuse
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
that
girl
of
Blooms-End
,
who
has
been
talked
about
more
or
*NL*
less
lately
?
If
so
,
I
know
her
;
and
I
can
guess
what
has
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
no
matter
...
Now
,
sir
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
we
shall
soon
have
*NL*
to
part
company
.
My
ponies
are
tired
,
and
I
have
further
to
go
,
and
I
*NL*
am
going
to
rest
them
under
this
bank
for
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
traveller
nodded
his
head
indifferently
,
and
the
reddleman
*NL*
turned
his
horses
and
van
in
upon
the
turf
,
saying
,
``
Good
night
.
''
The
*NL*
old
man
replied
,
and
proceeded
on
his
way
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
watched
his
form
as
it
diminished
to
a
speck
on
the
road
*NL*
and
became
absorbed
in
the
thickening
films
of
night
.
He
then
took
*NL*
some
hay
from
a
truss
which
was
slung
up
under
the
van
,
and
,
throwing
*NL*
a
portion
of
it
in
front
of
the
horses
,
made
a
pad
of
the
rest
,
*NL*
which
he
laid
on
the
ground
beside
his
vehicle
.
Upon
this
he
sat
*NL*
down
,
leaning
his
back
against
the
wheel
.
From
the
interior
a
low
*NL*
soft
breathing
came
to
his
ear
.
It
appeared
to
satisfy
him
,
and
he
*NL*
musingly
surveyed
the
scene
,
as
if
considering
the
next
step
that
he
*NL*
should
take
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
do
things
musingly
,
and
by
small
degrees
,
seemed
,
indeed
,
to
be
*NL*
a
duty
in
the
Egdon
valleys
at
this
transitional
hour
,
for
there
*NL*
was
that
in
the
condition
of
the
heath
itself
which
resembled
*NL*
protracted
and
halting
dubiousness
.
It
was
the
quality
of
the
repose
*NL*
appertaining
to
the
scene
.
This
was
not
the
repose
of
actual
*NL*
stagnation
,
but
the
apparent
repose
of
incredible
slowness
.
A
*NL*
condition
of
healthy
life
so
nearly
resembling
the
torpor
of
death
*NL*
is
a
noticeable
thing
of
its
sort
;
to
exhibit
the
inertness
of
the
*NL*
desert
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
exercising
powers
akin
to
those
of
*NL*
the
meadow
,
and
even
of
the
forest
,
awakened
in
those
who
thought
of
*NL*
it
the
attentiveness
usually
engendered
by
understatement
and
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
before
the
reddleman
's
eyes
was
a
gradual
series
of
ascents
*NL*
from
the
level
of
the
road
backward
into
the
heart
of
the
heath
.
It
*NL*
embraced
hillocks
,
pits
,
ridges
,
acclivities
,
one
behind
the
other
,
*NL*
till
all
was
finished
by
a
high
hill
cutting
against
the
still
light
*NL*
sky
.
The
traveller
's
eye
hovered
about
these
things
for
a
time
,
and
*NL*
finally
settled
upon
one
noteworthy
object
up
there
.
It
was
a
barrow
.
*NL*
This
bossy
projection
of
earth
above
its
natural
level
occupied
the
*NL*
loftiest
ground
of
the
loneliest
height
that
the
heath
contained
.
*NL*
Although
from
the
vale
it
appeared
but
as
a
wart
on
an
Atlantean
*NL*
brow
,
its
actual
bulk
was
great
.
It
formed
the
pole
and
axis
of
this
*NL*
heathery
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
resting
man
looked
at
the
barrow
he
became
aware
that
its
*NL*
summit
,
hitherto
the
highest
object
in
the
whole
prospect
round
,
was
*NL*
surmounted
by
something
higher
.
It
rose
from
the
semi-globular
mound
*NL*
like
a
spike
from
a
helmet
.
The
first
instinct
of
an
imaginative
*NL*
stranger
might
have
been
to
suppose
it
the
person
of
one
of
the
Celts
*NL*
who
built
the
barrow
,
so
far
had
all
of
modern
date
withdrawn
from
the
*NL*
scene
.
It
seemed
a
sort
of
last
man
among
them
,
musing
for
a
moment
*NL*
before
dropping
into
eternal
night
with
the
rest
of
his
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
the
form
stood
,
motionless
as
the
hill
beneath
.
Above
the
plain
*NL*
rose
the
hill
,
above
the
hill
rose
the
barrow
,
and
above
the
barrow
*NL*
rose
the
figure
.
Above
the
figure
was
nothing
that
could
be
mapped
*NL*
elsewhere
than
on
a
celestial
globe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
perfect
,
delicate
,
and
necessary
finish
did
the
figure
give
*NL*
to
the
dark
pile
of
hills
that
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
obvious
*NL*
justification
of
their
outline
.
Without
it
,
there
was
the
dome
*NL*
without
the
lantern
;
with
it
the
architectural
demands
of
the
mass
*NL*
were
satisfied
.
The
scene
was
strangely
homogeneous
,
in
that
the
*NL*
vale
,
the
upland
,
the
barrow
,
and
the
figure
above
it
amounted
only
to
*NL*
unity
.
Looking
at
this
or
that
member
of
the
group
was
not
observing
*NL*
a
complete
thing
,
but
a
fraction
of
a
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
form
was
so
much
like
an
organic
part
of
the
entire
motionless
*NL*
structure
that
to
see
it
move
would
have
impressed
the
mind
as
a
*NL*
strange
phenomenon
.
Immobility
being
the
chief
characteristic
of
*NL*
that
whole
which
the
person
formed
portion
of
,
the
discontinuance
of
*NL*
immobility
in
any
quarter
suggested
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
that
is
what
happened
.
The
figure
perceptibly
gave
up
its
fixity
,
*NL*
shifted
a
step
or
two
,
and
turned
round
.
As
if
alarmed
,
it
descended
*NL*
on
the
right
side
of
the
barrow
,
with
the
glide
of
a
water-drop
down
a
*NL*
bud
,
and
then
vanished
.
The
movement
had
been
sufficient
to
show
more
*NL*
clearly
the
characteristics
of
the
figure
,
and
that
it
was
a
woman
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reason
of
her
sudden
displacement
now
appeared
.
With
her
dropping
*NL*
out
of
sight
on
the
right
side
,
a
new-comer
,
bearing
a
burden
,
*NL*
protruded
into
the
sky
on
the
left
side
,
ascended
the
tumulus
,
and
*NL*
deposited
the
burden
on
the
top
.
A
second
followed
,
then
a
third
,
a
*NL*
fourth
,
a
fifth
,
and
ultimately
the
whole
barrow
was
peopled
with
*NL*
burdened
figures
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
intelligible
meaning
in
this
sky-backed
pantomime
of
*NL*
silhouettes
was
that
the
woman
had
no
relation
to
the
forms
who
had
*NL*
taken
her
place
,
was
sedulously
avoiding
these
,
and
had
come
thither
*NL*
for
another
object
than
theirs
.
The
imagination
of
the
observer
clung
*NL*
by
preference
to
that
vanished
,
solitary
figure
,
as
to
something
more
*NL*
interesting
,
more
important
,
more
likely
to
have
a
history
worth
*NL*
knowing
than
these
new-comers
,
and
unconsciously
regarded
them
as
*NL*
intruders
.
But
they
remained
,
and
established
themselves
;
and
the
*NL*
lonely
person
who
hitherto
had
been
queen
of
the
solitude
did
not
at
*NL*
present
seem
likely
to
return
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
Custom
of
the
Country
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Had
a
looker-on
been
posted
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
barrow
,
*NL*
he
would
have
learned
that
these
persons
were
boys
and
men
of
the
*NL*
neighbouring
hamlets
.
Each
,
as
he
ascended
the
barrow
,
had
been
*NL*
heavily
laden
with
furze-faggots
,
carried
upon
the
shoulder
by
means
*NL*
of
a
long
stake
sharpened
at
each
end
for
impaling
them
easily
--
two
*NL*
in
front
and
two
behind
.
They
came
from
a
part
of
the
heath
a
quarter
*NL*
of
a
mile
to
the
rear
,
where
furze
almost
exclusively
prevailed
as
a
*NL*
product
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
individual
was
so
involved
in
furze
by
his
method
of
carrying
*NL*
the
faggots
that
he
appeared
like
a
bush
on
legs
till
he
had
thrown
*NL*
them
down
.
The
party
had
marched
in
trail
,
like
a
travelling
flock
of
*NL*
sheep
;
that
is
to
say
,
the
strongest
first
,
the
weak
and
young
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
loads
were
all
laid
together
,
and
a
pyramid
of
furze
thirty
feet
*NL*
in
circumference
now
occupied
the
crown
of
the
tumulus
,
which
was
*NL*
known
as
Rainbarrow
for
many
miles
round
.
Some
made
themselves
busy
*NL*
with
matches
,
and
in
selecting
the
driest
tufts
of
furze
,
others
in
*NL*
loosening
the
bramble
bonds
which
held
the
faggots
together
.
Others
,
*NL*
again
,
while
this
was
in
progress
,
lifted
their
eyes
and
swept
the
*NL*
vast
expanse
of
country
commanded
by
their
position
,
now
lying
nearly
*NL*
obliterated
by
shade
.
In
the
valleys
of
the
heath
nothing
save
its
*NL*
own
wild
face
was
visible
at
any
time
of
day
;
but
this
spot
commanded
*NL*
a
horizon
enclosing
a
tract
of
far
extent
,
and
in
many
cases
lying
*NL*
beyond
the
heath
country
.
None
of
its
features
could
be
seen
now
,
but
*NL*
the
whole
made
itself
felt
as
a
vague
stretch
of
remoteness
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
men
and
lads
were
building
the
pile
,
a
change
took
place
in
*NL*
the
mass
of
shade
which
denoted
the
distant
landscape
.
Red
suns
and
*NL*
tufts
of
fire
one
by
one
began
to
arise
,
flecking
the
whole
country
*NL*
round
.
They
were
the
bonfires
of
other
parishes
and
hamlets
that
were
*NL*
engaged
in
the
same
sort
of
commemoration
.
Some
were
distant
,
and
*NL*
stood
in
a
dense
atmosphere
,
so
that
bundles
of
pale
strawlike
beams
*NL*
radiated
around
them
in
the
shape
of
a
fan
.
Some
were
large
and
near
,
*NL*
glowing
scarlet-red
from
the
shade
,
like
wounds
in
a
black
hide
.
Some
*NL*
were
Maenades
,
with
winy
faces
and
blown
hair
.
These
tinctured
the
*NL*
silent
bosom
of
the
clouds
above
them
and
lit
up
their
ephemeral
*NL*
caves
,
which
seemed
thenceforth
to
become
scalding
caldrons
.
Perhaps
*NL*
as
many
as
thirty
bonfires
could
be
counted
within
the
whole
bounds
*NL*
of
the
district
;
and
as
the
hour
may
be
told
on
a
clock-face
when
*NL*
the
figures
themselves
are
invisible
,
so
did
the
men
recognize
the
*NL*
locality
of
each
fire
by
its
angle
and
direction
,
though
nothing
of
*NL*
the
scenery
could
be
viewed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
tall
flame
from
Rainbarrow
sprang
into
the
sky
,
attracting
*NL*
all
eyes
that
had
been
fixed
on
the
distant
conflagrations
back
to
*NL*
their
own
attempt
in
the
same
kind
.
The
cheerful
blaze
streaked
the
*NL*
inner
surface
of
the
human
circle
--
now
increased
by
other
stragglers
,
*NL*
male
and
female
--
with
its
own
gold
livery
,
and
even
overlaid
the
*NL*
dark
turf
around
with
a
lively
luminousness
,
which
softened
off
into
*NL*
obscurity
where
the
barrow
rounded
downwards
out
of
sight
.
It
showed
*NL*
the
barrow
to
be
the
segment
of
a
globe
,
as
perfect
as
on
the
day
when
*NL*
it
was
thrown
up
,
even
the
little
ditch
remaining
from
which
the
earth
*NL*
was
dug
.
Not
a
plough
had
ever
disturbed
a
grain
of
that
stubborn
*NL*
soil
.
In
the
heath
's
barrenness
to
the
farmer
lay
its
fertility
to
*NL*
the
historian
.
There
had
been
no
obliteration
,
because
there
had
been
*NL*
no
tending
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
if
the
bonfire-makers
were
standing
in
some
radiant
*NL*
upper
story
of
the
world
,
detached
from
and
independent
of
the
dark
*NL*
stretches
below
.
The
heath
down
there
was
now
a
vast
abyss
,
and
no
*NL*
longer
a
continuation
of
what
they
stood
on
;
for
their
eyes
,
adapted
*NL*
to
the
blaze
,
could
see
nothing
of
the
deeps
beyond
its
influence
.
*NL*
Occasionally
,
it
is
true
,
a
more
vigorous
flare
than
usual
from
their
*NL*
faggots
sent
darting
lights
like
aides-de-camp
down
the
inclines
to
*NL*
some
distant
bush
,
pool
,
or
patch
of
white
sand
,
kindling
these
to
*NL*
replies
of
the
same
colour
,
till
all
was
lost
in
darkness
again
.
Then
*NL*
the
whole
black
phenomenon
beneath
represented
Limbo
as
viewed
from
*NL*
the
brink
by
the
sublime
Florentine
in
his
vision
,
and
the
muttered
*NL*
articulations
of
the
wind
in
the
hollows
were
as
complaints
and
*NL*
petitions
from
the
``
souls
of
mighty
worth
''
suspended
therein
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
if
these
men
and
boys
had
suddenly
dived
into
past
ages
,
and
*NL*
fetched
therefrom
an
hour
and
deed
which
had
before
been
familiar
with
*NL*
this
spot
.
The
ashes
of
the
original
British
pyre
which
blazed
from
*NL*
that
summit
lay
fresh
and
undisturbed
in
the
barrow
beneath
their
*NL*
tread
.
The
flames
from
funeral
piles
long
ago
kindled
there
had
shone
*NL*
down
upon
the
lowlands
as
these
were
shining
now
.
Festival
fires
to
*NL*
Thor
and
Woden
had
followed
on
the
same
ground
and
duly
had
their
day
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
it
is
pretty
well
known
that
such
blazes
as
this
the
heathmen
*NL*
were
now
enjoying
are
rather
the
lineal
descendants
from
jumbled
*NL*
Druidical
rites
and
Saxon
ceremonies
than
the
invention
of
popular
*NL*
feeling
about
Gunpowder
Plot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
to
light
a
fire
is
the
instinctive
and
resistant
act
of
man
*NL*
when
,
at
the
winter
ingress
,
the
curfew
is
sounded
throughout
Nature
.
*NL*
It
indicates
a
spontaneous
,
Promethean
rebelliousness
against
that
*NL*
fiat
that
this
recurrent
season
shall
bring
foul
times
,
cold
darkness
,
*NL*
misery
and
death
.
Black
chaos
comes
,
and
the
fettered
gods
of
the
*NL*
earth
say
,
Let
there
be
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brilliant
lights
and
sooty
shades
which
struggled
upon
the
skin
*NL*
and
clothes
of
the
persons
standing
round
caused
their
lineaments
and
*NL*
general
contours
to
be
drawn
with
Dureresque
vigour
and
dash
.
Yet
the
*NL*
permanent
moral
expression
of
each
face
it
was
impossible
to
discover
,
*NL*
for
as
the
nimble
flames
towered
,
nodded
,
and
swooped
through
the
*NL*
surrounding
air
,
the
blots
of
shade
and
flakes
of
light
upon
the
*NL*
countenances
of
the
group
changed
shape
and
position
endlessly
.
All
*NL*
was
unstable
;
quivering
as
leaves
,
evanescent
as
lightning
.
Shadowy
*NL*
eye-sockets
,
deep
as
those
of
a
death
's
head
,
suddenly
turned
into
*NL*
pits
of
lustre
:
a
lantern-jaw
was
cavernous
,
then
it
was
shining
;
*NL*
wrinkles
were
emphasized
to
ravines
,
or
obliterated
entirely
by
a
*NL*
changed
ray
.
Nostrils
were
dark
wells
;
sinews
in
old
necks
were
gilt
*NL*
mouldings
;
things
with
no
particular
polish
on
them
were
glazed
;
*NL*
bright
objects
,
such
as
the
tip
of
a
furze-hook
one
of
the
men
*NL*
carried
,
were
as
glass
;
eyeballs
glowed
like
little
lanterns
.
Those
*NL*
whom
Nature
had
depicted
as
merely
quaint
became
grotesque
,
the
*NL*
grotesque
became
preternatural
;
for
all
was
in
extremity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
it
may
be
that
the
face
of
an
old
man
,
who
had
like
others
been
*NL*
called
to
the
heights
by
the
rising
flames
,
was
not
really
the
mere
*NL*
nose
and
chin
that
it
appeared
to
be
,
but
an
appreciable
quantity
of
*NL*
human
countenance
.
He
stood
complacently
sunning
himself
in
the
heat
.
*NL*
With
a
speaker
,
or
stake
,
he
tossed
the
outlying
scraps
of
fuel
into
*NL*
the
conflagration
,
looking
at
the
midst
of
the
pile
,
occasionally
*NL*
lifting
his
eyes
to
measure
the
height
of
the
flame
,
or
to
follow
the
*NL*
great
sparks
which
rose
with
it
and
sailed
away
into
darkness
.
The
*NL*
beaming
sight
,
and
the
penetrating
warmth
,
seemed
to
breed
in
him
a
*NL*
cumulative
cheerfulness
,
which
soon
amounted
to
delight
.
With
his
*NL*
stick
in
his
hand
he
began
to
jig
a
private
minuet
,
a
bunch
of
copper
*NL*
seals
shining
and
swinging
like
a
pendulum
from
under
his
waistcoat
:
*NL*
he
also
began
to
sing
,
in
the
voice
of
a
bee
up
a
flue
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Want
of
breath
prevented
a
continuance
of
the
song
;
and
the
breakdown
*NL*
attracted
the
attention
of
a
firm-standing
man
of
middle
age
,
who
*NL*
kept
each
corner
of
his
crescent-shaped
mouth
rigorously
drawn
back
*NL*
into
his
cheek
,
as
if
to
do
away
with
any
suspicion
of
mirthfulness
*NL*
which
might
erroneously
have
attached
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

closer

tighter

giving
out
the
bad

before

proved
how

not

had
to

with

all
at

The
audience
cleared
their
throats
and
tossed
a
few
stalks
into
the
*NL*
fire
,
not
because
these
deeds
were
urgent
,
but
to
give
themselves
time
*NL*
to
weigh
the
moral
of
the
story
.

*NL*

an
earnest
voice

that
of
Olly
Dowden
,
a
*NL*
woman
who
lived
by
making
heath
brooms

besoms

Her
nature
was
to

be
civil
to
enemies

grateful
to
all

alive

``

with
an
unheeding
air

to
show
that
his
words
were
no

appendage
to
Humphrey

,

the
result
of
independent
reflection

stooped

turned

Ah
,
Humph
,
well
I
can
mind
when
I
was
married
how
I
zid
thy
*NL*
father
's
mark
staring
me
in
the
face
as
I
went
to
put
down
my
name
.
*NL*
He
and
your
mother
were
the
couple
married
just
afore
we
were
and
*NL*
there
stood
they
father
's
cross
with
arms
stretched
out
like
a
great
*NL*
banging
scarecrow
.
What
a
terrible
black
cross
that
was
--
thy
father

*NL*
very
likeness

To
save
my
soul
I
could
n't
help
laughing
when
I
*NL*
zid
en
,
though
all
the

I
was
as
hot
as

with
the
*NL*
marrying

what
with
the

a-hanging
to
me

what
with
Jack

Changley
and
a

more
chaps
grinning
at
me
through
church
window
.
*NL*
But
the
next
moment
a
strawmote
would
have
knocked
me
down
,
for
I
*NL*
called
to
mind
that
if
thy
father
and
mother
had
had
high
words
once
,
*NL*
they
'd
been
at
it
twenty
times
since
they
'd
been
man
and
wife
,
and
I
*NL*
zid
myself
as
the
next
poor
stunpoll
to
get
into
the

*NL*
mess

a

The

who
had
newly

*NL*
carried
across

in

*NL*
Thus
requested

a

with
reedy
hair

no

a
*NL*
great
quantity
of
wrist

beyond

advanced
a

two
by
his

was
pushed
by
the

of

half
a

more
;
Grandfer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
't
is
very
odd
,
but
I
never
feel
lonely
--
no
,
not
at
all
,
''
said
*NL*
Grandfer
Cantle
.
``
I
am
as
brave
in
the
night-time
as

*NL*
*NL*
The
bonfire
was
by
this
time
beginning
to
sink
low
,
for
the
fuel
had
*NL*
not
been
of
that
substantial
sort
which
can
support
a
blaze
long
.
*NL*
Most
of
the
other
fires
within
the
wide
horizon
were
also
dwindling
*NL*
weak
.
Attentive
observation
of
their
brightness
,
colour
,
and
length
*NL*
of
existence
would
have
revealed
the
quality
of
the
material
burnt
,
*NL*
and
through
that
,
to
some
extent
the
natural
produce
of
the
district
*NL*
in
which
each
bonfire
was
situate
.
The
clear
,
kingly
effulgence
that
*NL*
had
characterized
the
majority
expressed
a
heath
and
furze
country
*NL*
like
their
own
,
which
in
one
direction
extended
an
unlimited
number
of
*NL*
miles
;
the
rapid
flares
and
extinctions
at
other
points
of
the
compass
*NL*
showed
the
lightest
of
fuel
--
straw
,
beanstalks
,
and
the
usual
waste
*NL*
from
arable
land
.
The
most
enduring
of
all
--
steady
unaltering
eyes
*NL*
like
Planets
--
signified
wood
,
such
as
hazel-branches
,
thorn-faggots
,
*NL*
and
stout
billets
.
Fires
of
the
last-mentioned
materials
were
rare
,
*NL*
and
though
comparatively
small
in
magnitude
beside
the
transient
*NL*
blazes
,
now
began
to
get
the
best
of
them
by
mere
long
continuance
.
*NL*
The
great
ones
had
perished
,
but
these
remained
.
They
occupied
the
*NL*
remotest
visible
positions
--
sky-backed
summits
rising
out
of
rich
*NL*
coppice
and
plantation
districts
to
the
north
,
where
the
soil
was
*NL*
different
,
and
heath
foreign
and
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
Save
one
;
and
this
was
the
nearest
of
any
,
the
moon
of
the
whole
*NL*
shining
throng
.
It
lay
in
a
direction
precisely
opposite
to
that
of
*NL*
the
little
window
in
the
vale
below
.
Its
nearness
was
such
that
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
its
actual
smallness
,
its
glow
infinitely
transcended
*NL*
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
quiet
eye
had
attracted
attention
from
time
to
time
;
and
when
*NL*
their
own
fire
had
become
sunken
and
dim
it
attracted
more
;
some
even
*NL*
of
the
wood
fires
more
recently
lighted
had
reached
their
decline
,
but
*NL*
no
change
was
perceptible
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
how
near
that
fire
is
!
''
said
Fairway
.
``
Seemingly
.
I
can
*NL*
see
a
fellow
of
some
sort
walking
round
it

Little
and
good
must
be
*NL*
said
of
that
fire
,
surely

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
throw
a
stone
there

the
boy
.

*NL*

*NL*

the

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
addressed
to
Susan
Nunsuch
;
and
the
next
circumstance
of
*NL*
which
the
beholders
were
conscious
was
a
vision
of
the
matron
's
broad
*NL*
form
whisking
off
towards
the
space
whereon
the
fire
had
been
kindled
.
*NL*
She
was
lifted
bodily
by
Mr.
Fairway
's
arm
,
which
had
been
flung
round
*NL*
her
waist
before
she
had
become
aware
of
his
intention
.
The
site
of
*NL*
the
fire
was
now
merely
a
circle
of
ashes
flecked
with
red
embers
*NL*
and
sparks
,
the
furze
having
burnt
completely
away
.
Once
within
the
*NL*
circle
he
whirled
her
round
and
round
in
a
dance
.
She
was
a
woman
*NL*
noisily
constructed
;
in
addition
to
her
enclosing
framework
of
*NL*
whalebone
and
lath
,
she
wore
pattens
summer
and
winter
,
in
wet
weather
*NL*
and
in
dry
,
to
preserve
her
boots
from
wear
;
and
when
Fairway
began
to
*NL*
jump
about
with
her
,
the
clicking
of
the
pattens
,
the
creaking
of
the
*NL*
stays
,
and
her
screams
of
surprise
,
formed
a
very
audible
concert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
crack
thy
numskull
for
thee
,
you
mandy
chap
!
''
said
Mrs.
Nunsuch
,
*NL*
as
she
helplessly
danced
round
with
him
,
her
feet
playing
like
*NL*
drumsticks
among
the
sparks
.
``
My
ankles
were
all
in
a
fever
before
,
*NL*
from
walking
through
that
prickly
furze
,
and
now
you
must
make
'em
*NL*
worse
with
these
vlankers

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
vagary
of
Timothy
Fairway
was
infectious
.
The
turf-cutter
seized
*NL*
old
Olly
Dowden
,
and
,
somewhat
more
gently
,
poussetted
with
her
*NL*
likewise
.
The
young
men
were
not
slow
to
imitate
the
example
of
their
*NL*
elders
,
and
seized
the
maids
;
Grandfer
Cantle
and
his
stick
jigged
in
*NL*
the
form
of
a
three-legged
object
among
the
rest
;
and
in
half
a
minute
*NL*
all
that
could
be
seen
on
Rainbarrow
was
a
whirling
of
dark
shapes
*NL*
amid
a
boiling
confusion
of
sparks
,
which
leapt
around
the
dancers
*NL*
as
high
as
their
waists
.
The
chief
noises
were
women
's
shrill
*NL*
cries
,
men
's
laughter
,
Susan
's
stays
and
pattens
,
Olly
Dowden
's
*NL*
``
heu-heu-heu
!
''
and
the
strumming
of
the
wind
upon
the
furze-bushes
,
*NL*
which
formed
a
kind
of
tune
to
the
demoniac
measure
they
trod
.
*NL*
Christian
alone
stood
aloof
,
uneasily
rocking
himself
as
he
murmured
,
*NL*
``
They
ought
not
to
do
it

*NL*
*NL*

said
one
of
the
lads
,
stopping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

where

''
said
Christian
,
hastily
closing
up
to
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dancers
all
lessened
their
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
behind

heard
it

down
there

*NL*
*NL*
``

a

from
the
darkness
.

Fairway

came
to
them
in
the
same
voice
,
as
a
long

slim
*NL*
indistinct
figure
approached
the
barrow
.
*NL*

When

arose
it
revealed

withdrew
from
their

down
the
barrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
I
've
seen

Humphrey

``
But

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
had
not
been
gone
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
another
*NL*
person
approached
the
partially
revived
bonfire
.
It
proved
to
be
a
*NL*
well-known
and
respected
widow
of
the
neighbourhood
,
of
a
standing
*NL*
which
can
only
be
expressed
by
the
word
genteel
.
Her
face
,
*NL*
encompassed
by
the
blackness
of
the
receding
heath
,
showed
whitely
,
*NL*
and
without
half-lights
,
like
a
cameo
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
woman
of
middle-age
,
with
well-formed
features
of
the
type
*NL*
usually
found
where
perspicacity
is
the
chief
quality
enthroned
*NL*
within
.
At
moments
she
seemed
to
be
regarding
issues
from
a
Nebo
*NL*
denied
to
others
around
.
She
had
something
of
an
estranged
mien
;
the
*NL*
solitude
exhaled
from
the
heath
was
concentrated
in
this
face
that
*NL*
had
risen
from
it
.
The
air
with
which
she
looked
at
the
heathmen
*NL*
betokened
a
certain
unconcern
at
their
presence
,
or
at
what
might
be
*NL*
their
opinions
of
her
for
walking
in
that
lonely
spot
at
such
an
hour
,
*NL*
this
indirectly
implying
that
in
some
respect
or
other
they
were
not
*NL*
up
to
her
level
.
The
explanation
lay
in
the
fact
that
though
her
*NL*
husband
had
been
a
small
farmer
she
herself
was
a
curate
's
daughter
,
*NL*
who
had
once
dreamt
of
doing
better
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Persons
with
any
weight
of
character
carry
,
like
planets
,
their
*NL*
atmospheres
along
with
them
in
their
orbits
;
and
the
matron
who
*NL*
entered
now
upon
the
scene
could
,
and
usually
did
,
bring
her
own
*NL*
tone
into
a
company
.
Her
normal
manner
among
the
heathfolk
had
*NL*
that
reticence
which
results
from
the
consciousness
of
superior
*NL*
communicative
power
.
But
the
effect
of

looking

towards
the

where
Grandfer

with
some
want
of

was
dancing
by

seeing

came
up

here
to
learn
what
was
going

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

sure

ma'am

I

*NL*
``
Why

be
safe

said
*NL*
Fairway
.
``
He

only
gone

coming
straight
home
as
soon
as

were

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we

take

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

It

keep

*NL*
*NL*
She
indicated
the
faint
light
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
which
*NL*
Fairway
had
pointed
out
;
and
the
two
women
descended
the
tumulus
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
The
Halt
on
the
Turnpike
Road
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Down
,
downward
they
went
,
and
yet
further
down
--
their
descent
at
each
*NL*
step
seeming
to
outmeasure
their
advance
.
Their
skirts
were
scratched
*NL*
noisily
by
the
furze
,
their
shoulders
brushed
by
the
ferns
,
which
,
*NL*
though
dead
and
dry
,
stood
erect
as
when
alive
,
no
sufficient
winter
*NL*
weather
having
as
yet
arrived
to
beat
them
down
.
Their
Tartarean
*NL*
situation
might
by
some
have
been
called
an
imprudent
one
for
two
*NL*
unattended
women
.
But
these
shaggy
recesses
were
at
all
seasons
a
*NL*
familiar
surrounding
to
Olly
and
Mrs.
Yeobright
;
and
the
addition
of
*NL*
darkness
lends
no
frightfulness
to
the
face
of
a
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
Tamsin
has
married
him
at
last
,
''
said
Olly
,
when
the
incline
*NL*
had
become
so
much
less
steep
that
their
footsteps
no
longer
required
*NL*
undivided
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
answered
slowly
,
``
Yes
:
at
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you
will
miss
her

living
with

always
*NL*
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
miss
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
Olly
,
though
without
the
tact
to
perceive
when
remarks
were
untimely
,
*NL*
was
saved
by
her
very
simplicity
from
rendering
them
offensive
.
*NL*
Questions
that
would
have
been
resented
in
others
she
could
ask
with
*NL*
impunity
.
This
accounted
for
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
acquiescence
in
the
*NL*
revival
of
an
evidently
sore
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
quite
strook
to
hear
you
'd
agreed
to
it
,
ma'am

that
I
was

*NL*
continued
the
besom-maker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
not
more
struck
by
it
than
I
should
have
been
last

There
are
a
good
many
sides
to
that
wedding

I
could
not

even
if

tried

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
myself

what
is
it

come
down
by

too
outwardly
given

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw

*NL*
``

may
call

what
they
will

several

acres

heth-ground
broke
up
here

public
house

heth-croppers

manners

quite
like

And
what
's
*NL*
done
can
not
be
undone

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
``
See
,
here
's
the
waggon-track
at
*NL*
last
.
Now
we
shall
get
along
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wedding
subject
was
no
further
dwelt
upon
;
and
soon
a
faint
*NL*
diverging
path
was
reached
,
where
they
parted
company
,
Olly
first
*NL*
begging
her
companion
to
remind
Mr.
Wildeve
that
he
had
not
sent
*NL*
her
sick
husband
the
bottle
of
wine
promised
on
the
occasion
of
his
*NL*
marriage
.
The
besom-maker
turned
to
the
left
towards
her
own
house
,
*NL*
behind
a
spur
of
the
hill
,
and
Mrs.
Yeobright
followed
the
straight
*NL*
track
,
which
further
on
joined
the
highway
by
the
Quiet
Woman
Inn
,
*NL*
whither
she
supposed
her
niece
to
have
returned
with
Wildeve
from
*NL*
their
wedding
at
Anglebury
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
first
reached
Wildeve
's
Patch
,
as
it
was
called
,
a
plot
of
land
*NL*
redeemed
from
the
heath
,
and
after
long
and
laborious
years
brought
*NL*
into
cultivation
.
The
man
who
had
discovered
that
it
could
be
tilled
*NL*
died
of
the
labour
;
the
man
who
succeeded
him
in
possession
ruined
*NL*
himself
in
fertilizing
it
.
Wildeve
came
like
Amerigo
Vespucci
,
and
*NL*
received
the
honours
due
to
those
who
had
gone
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Yeobright
had
drawn
near
to
the
inn
,
and
was
about
to
enter
,
*NL*
she
saw
a
horse
and
vehicle
some
two
hundred
yards
beyond
it
,
coming
*NL*
towards
her
,
a
man
walking
alongside
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
.
It
*NL*
was
soon
evident
that
this
was
the
reddleman
who
had
inquired
for
her
.
*NL*
Instead
of
entering
the
inn
at
once
,
she
walked
by
it
and
towards
the
*NL*
van
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conveyance
came
close
,
and
the
man
was
about
to
pass
her
with
*NL*
little
notice
,
when
she
turned
to
him
and
said
,
``
I
think
you
have
been
*NL*
inquiring
for
me
?
I
am
Mrs.
Yeobright
of
Blooms-End
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
started
,
and
held
up
his
finger
.
He
stopped
the
horses
,
*NL*
and
beckoned
to
her
to
withdraw
with
him
a
few
yards
aside
,
which
she
*NL*
did
,
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
me
,
ma'am
,
I
suppose
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
,
''
said
she
.
``
Why
,
yes
,
I
do
!
You
are
young

--

*NL*
father
was
a
dairyman
somewhere
here
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

and
I
knew

Miss
Tamsin

tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
About

has
just
come
home
,
I
believe
,
with
her

*NL*
They
arranged
to
return
this
afternoon
--
to
the
inn
beyond
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
's
here

She
's
in
my
van
,
''
he
added
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
new
trouble
has
come
?
''
murmured
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
putting
her
hand
*NL*
over
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
explain
much
,
ma'am
.
All
I
know
is
that
,
as
I
was
going
*NL*
along
the
road
this
morning
,
about
a
mile
out
of
Anglebury
,
I
heard
*NL*
something
trotting
after
me
like
a
doe
,
and
looking
round
there
she
*NL*
was
,
white
as
death
itself
.
`
Oh
,
Diggory
Venn
!
'
she
said
,
'
I
thought
*NL*
't
was
you
:
will
you
help
me
?
I
am
in
trouble
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
she
know
your
Christian
name
?
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
*NL*
doubtingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
met
her
as
a
lad
before
I
went
away
in
this
trade
.
She
asked
*NL*
then
if
she
might
ride
,
and
then
down
she
fell
in
a
faint
.
I
picked
*NL*
her
up
and
put
her
in
,
and
there
she
has
been
ever
since
.
She
has
*NL*
cried
a
good
deal
,
but
she
has
hardly
spoke
;
all
she
has
told
me
being
*NL*
that
she
was
to
have
been
married
this
morning
.
I
tried
to
get
her
to
*NL*
eat
something
,
but
she
could
n't
;
and
at
last
she
fell
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
her
at
once
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
hastening
towards
the
*NL*
van
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
followed
with
the
lantern
,
and
,
stepping
up
first
,
*NL*
assisted
Mrs.
Yeobright
to
mount
beside
him
.
On
the
door
being
*NL*
opened
she
perceived
at
the
end
of
the
van
an
extemporized
couch
,
*NL*
around
which
was
hung
apparently
all
the
drapery
that
the
reddleman
*NL*
possessed
,
to
keep
the
occupant
of
the
little
couch
from
contact
with
*NL*
the
red
materials
of
his
trade
.
A
young
girl
lay
thereon
,
covered
*NL*
with
a
cloak
.
She
was
asleep
,
and
the
light
of
the
lantern
fell
upon
*NL*
her
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fair
,
sweet
,
and
honest
country
face
was
revealed
,
reposing
in
a
*NL*
nest
of
wavy
chestnut
hair
.
It
was
between
pretty
and
beautiful
.
*NL*
Though
her
eyes
were
closed
,
one
could
easily
imagine
the
light
*NL*
necessarily
shining
in
them
as
the
culmination
of
the
luminous
*NL*
workmanship
around
.
The
groundwork
of
the
face
was
hopefulness
;
but
*NL*
over
it
now
lay
like
a
foreign
substance
a
film
of
anxiety
and
grief
.
*NL*
The
grief
had
been
there
so
shortly
as
to
have
abstracted
nothing
*NL*
of
the
bloom
,
and
had
as
yet
but
given
a
dignity
to
what
it
might
*NL*
eventually
undermine
.
The
scarlet
of
her
lips
had
not
had
time
to
*NL*
abate
,
and
just
now
it
appeared
still
more
intense
by
the
absence
of
*NL*
the
neighbouring
and
more
transient
colour
of
her
cheek
.
The
lips
*NL*
frequently
parted
,
with
a
murmur
of
words
.
She
seemed
to
belong
*NL*
rightly
to
a
madrigal
--
to
require
viewing
through
rhyme
and
harmony
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
at
least
was
obvious
:
she
was
not
made
to
be
looked
at
thus
.
*NL*
The
reddleman
had
appeared
conscious
of
as
much
,
and
,
while
Mrs.
*NL*
Yeobright
looked
in
upon
her
,
he
cast
his
eyes
aside
with
a
delicacy
*NL*
which
well
became
him
.
The
sleeper
apparently
thought
so
too
,
for
the
*NL*
next
moment
she
opened
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lips
then
parted
with
something
of
anticipation
,
something
more
*NL*
of
doubt
;
and
her
several
thoughts
and
fractions
of
thoughts
,
as
*NL*
signalled
by
the
changes
on
her
face
,
were
exhibited
by
the
light
to
*NL*
the
utmost
nicety
.
An
ingenuous
,
transparent
life
was
disclosed
,
as
*NL*
if
the
flow
of
her
existence
could
be
seen
passing
within
her
.
She
*NL*
understood
the
scene
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
it
is
I
,
aunt
,
''
she
cried
.
``
I
know
how
frightened
you
are
,
*NL*
and
how
you
can
not
believe
it
;
but
all
the
same
,
it
is
I
who
have
come
*NL*
home
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tamsin
,
Tamsin
!
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
stooping
over
the
young
woman
*NL*
and
kissing
her
.
``
O
my
dear
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
was
now
on
the
verge
of
a
sob
,
but
by
an
unexpected
*NL*
self-command
she
uttered
no
sound
.
With
a
gentle
panting
breath
she
*NL*
sat
upright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
expect
to
see
you
in
this
state
,
any
more
than
you
me
,
''
she
*NL*
went
on
quickly
.
``
Where
am
I
,
aunt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
home
,
my
dear
.
In
Egdon
Bottom
.
What
dreadful
thing
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
in
a
moment
.
So
near
,
are
we
?
Then
I
will
get
out
and
*NL*
walk
.
I
want
to
go
home
by
the
path
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
kind
man
who
has
done
so
much
will
,
I
am
sure
,
take
you
*NL*
right
on
to
my
house
?
''
said
the
aunt
,
turning
to
the
reddleman
,
who
*NL*
had
withdrawn
from
the
front
of
the
van
on
the
awakening
of
the
girl
,
*NL*
and
stood
in
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
think
it
necessary
to
ask
me
?
I
will
,
of
course
,
''
*NL*
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
indeed
kind
,
''
murmured
Thomasin
.
``
I
was
once
acquainted
with
*NL*
him
,
aunt
,
and
when
I
saw
him
today
I
thought
I
should
prefer
his
van
*NL*
to
any
conveyance
of
a
stranger
.
But
I
'll
walk
now
.
Reddleman
,
stop
*NL*
the
horses
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
regarded
her
with
tender
reluctance
,
but
stopped
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
and
niece
then
descended
from
the
van
,
Mrs.
Yeobright
saying
to
*NL*
its
owner
,
``
I
quite
recognize
you
now
.
What
made
you
change
from
the
*NL*
nice
business
your
father
left
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
,
''
he
said
,
and
looked
at
Thomasin
,
who
blushed
a
little
.
*NL*
``
Then
you
'll
not
be
wanting
me
any
more
to-night
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
glanced
around
at
the
dark
sky
,
at
the
hills
,
at
the
*NL*
perishing
bonfires
,
and
at
the
lighted
window
of
the
inn
they
had
*NL*
neared
.
``
I
think
not
,
''
she
said
,
``
since
Thomasin
wishes
to
walk
.
We
*NL*
can
soon
run
up
the
path
and
reach
home
:
we
know
it
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
a
few
further
words
they
parted
,
the
reddleman
moving
*NL*
onwards
with
his
van
,
and
the
two
women
remaining
standing
in
the
*NL*
road
.
As
soon
as
the
vehicle
and
its
driver
had
withdrawn
so
far
as
*NL*
to
be
beyond
all
possible
reach
of
her
voice
,
Mrs.
Yeobright
turned
*NL*
to
her
niece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Thomasin
,
''
she
said
sternly
,
``
what
's
the
meaning
of
this
*NL*
disgraceful
performance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
Perplexity
among
Honest
People
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
looked
as
if
quite
overcome
by
her
aunt
's
change
of
manner
.
*NL*
``
It
means
just
what
it
seems
to
mean
:
I
am
--
not
married
,
''
she
replied
*NL*
faintly
.
``
Excuse
me
--
for
humiliating
you
,
aunt
,
by
this
mishap
:
I
am
*NL*
sorry
for
it
.
But
I
can
not
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
Think
of
yourself
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
nobody
's
fault
.
When
we
got
there
the
parson
would
n't
marry
*NL*
us
because
of
some
trifling
irregularity
in
the
license
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
irregularity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Mr.
Wildeve
can
explain
.
I
did
not
think
when
I
went
*NL*
away
this
morning
that
I
should
come
back
like
this
.
''
It
being
dark
,
*NL*
Thomasin
allowed
her
emotion
to
escape
her
by
the
silent
way
of
tears
,
*NL*
which
could
roll
down
her
cheek
unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
almost
say
that
it
serves
you
right
--
if
I
did
not
feel
that
*NL*
you
do
n't
deserve
it
,
''
continued
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
who
,
possessing
two
*NL*
distinct
moods
in
close
contiguity
,
a
gentle
mood
and
an
angry
,
flew
*NL*
from
one
to
the
other
without
the
least
warning
.
``
Remember
,
Thomasin
,
*NL*
this
business
was
none
of
my
seeking
;
from
the
very
first
,
when
you
*NL*
began
to
feel
foolish
about
that
man
,
I
warned
you
he
would
not
make
*NL*
you
happy
.
I
felt
it
so
strongly
that
I
did
what
I
would
never
have
*NL*
believed
myself
capable
of
doing
--
stood
up
in
the
church
,
and
made
*NL*
myself
the
public
talk
for
weeks
.
But
having
once
consented
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
submit
to
these
fancies
without
good
reason
.
Marry
him
you
must
after
*NL*
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
I
wish
to
do
otherwise
for
one
moment
?
''
said
Thomasin
,
*NL*
with
a
heavy
sigh
.
``
I
know
how
wrong
it
was
of
me
to
love
him
,
but
*NL*
do
n't
pain
me
by
talking
like
that
,
aunt
!
You
would
not
have
had
me
*NL*
stay
there
with
him
,
would
you
?
--
and
your
house
is
the
only
home
I
*NL*
have
to
return
to
.
He
says
we
can
be
married
in
a
day
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
he
had
never
seen
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
then
I
will
be
the
miserablest
woman
in
the
world
,
and
not
*NL*
let
him
see
me
again
.
No
,
I
wo
n't
have
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
late
to
speak
so
.
Come
with
me
.
I
am
going
to
the
inn
to
*NL*
see
if
he
has
returned
.
Of
course
I
shall
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
*NL*
story
at
once
.
Mr.
Wildeve
must
not
suppose
he
can
play
tricks
upon
*NL*
me
,
or
any
belonging
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
that
.
The
license
was
wrong
,
and
he
could
n't
get
another
*NL*
the
same
day
.
He
will
tell
you
in
a
moment
how
it
was
,
if
he
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
he
bring
you
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
me
!

again
sobbed
Thomasin
.
``
When
I
found
we
could
not
be
*NL*
married
I
did
n't
like
to
come
back
with
him
,
and
I
was
very
ill
.
Then
*NL*
I
saw
Diggory
Venn
,
and
was
glad
to
get
him
to
take
me
home
.
I
can
not
*NL*
explain
it
any
better
,
and
you
must
be
angry
with
me
if
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
see
about
that
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
;
and
they
turned
towards
*NL*
the
inn
,
known
in
the
neighbourhood
as
the
Quiet
Woman
,
the
sign
of
*NL*
which
represented
the
figure
of
a
matron
carrying
her
head
under
her
*NL*
arm
,
beneath
which
gruesome
design
was
written
the
couplet
so
well
*NL*
known
to
frequenters
of
the
inn
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SINCE
THE
WOMAN
'S
QUIET
*NL*
LET
NO
MAN
BREED
A
RIOT
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
front
of
the
house
was
towards
the
heath
and
Rainbarrow
,
whose
*NL*
dark
shape
seemed
to
threaten
it
from
the
sky
.
Upon
the
door
was
*NL*
a
neglected
brass
plate
,
bearing
the
unexpected
inscription
,
``
Mr.
*NL*
Wildeve
,
Engineer
''
--
a
useless
yet
cherished
relic
from
the
time
when
*NL*
he
had
been
started
in
that
profession
in
an
office
at
Budmouth
by
*NL*
those
who
had
hoped
much
from
him
,
and
had
been
disappointed
.
The
*NL*
garden
was
at
the
back
,
and
behind
this
ran
a
still
deep
stream
,
*NL*
forming
the
margin
of
the
heath
in
that
direction
,
meadow-land
*NL*
appearing
beyond
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
thick
obscurity
permitted
only
skylines
to
be
visible
of
*NL*
any
scene
at
present
.
The
water
at
the
back
of
the
house
could
be
*NL*
heard
,
idly
spinning
whirpools
in
its
creep
between
the
rows
of
dry
*NL*
feather-headed
reeds
which
formed
a
stockade
along
each
bank
.
Their
*NL*
presence
was
denoted
by
sounds
as
of
a
congregation
praying
humbly
,
*NL*
produced
by
their
rubbing
against
each
other
in
the
slow
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
window
,
whence
the
candlelight
had
shone
up
the
vale
to
the
eyes
*NL*
of
the
bonfire
group
,
was
uncurtained
,
but
the
sill
lay
too
high
for
*NL*
a
pedestrian
on
the
outside
to
look
over
it
into
the
room
.
A
vast
*NL*
shadow
,
in
which
could
be
dimly
traced
portions
of
a
masculine
*NL*
contour
,
blotted
half
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
seems
to
be
at
home
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
I
come
in
,
too
,
aunt
?
''
asked
Thomasin
faintly
.
``
I
suppose
not
;
*NL*
it
would
be
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
come
,
certainly
--
to
confront
him
,
so
that
he
may
make
no
*NL*
false
representations
to
me
.
We
shall
not
be
five
minutes
in
the
*NL*
house
,
and
then
we
'll
walk
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Entering
the
open
passage
she
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
private
*NL*
parlour
,
unfastened
it
,
and
looked
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
back
and
shoulders
of
a
man
came
between
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
eyes
and
*NL*
the
fire
.
Wildeve
,
whose
form
it
was
,
immediately
turned
,
arose
,
and
*NL*
advanced
to
meet
his
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
quite
a
young
man
,
and
of
the
two
properties
,
form
and
motion
,
*NL*
the
latter
first
attracted
the
eye
in
him
.
The
grace
of
his
movement
*NL*
was
singular
:
it
was
the
pantomimic
expression
of
a
lady-killing
*NL*
career
.
Next
came
into
notice
the
more
material
qualities
,
among
*NL*
which
was
a
profuse
crop
of
hair
impending
over
the
top
of
his
face
,
*NL*
lending
to
his
forehead
the
high-cornered
outline
of
an
early
Gothic
*NL*
shield
;
and
a
neck
which
was
smooth
and
round
as
a
cylinder
.
The
lower
*NL*
half
of
his
figure
was
of
light
build
.
Altogether
he
was
one
in
whom
*NL*
no
man
would
have
seen
anything
to
admire
,
and
in
whom
no
woman
would
*NL*
have
seen
anything
to
dislike
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
discerned
the
young
girl
's
form
in
the
passage
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Thomasin
,
then
,
has
reached
home
.
How
could
you
leave
me
in
that
*NL*
way
,
darling
?
''
And
turning
to
Mrs.
Yeobright
:
``
It
was
useless
to
argue
*NL*
with
her
.
She
would
go
,
and
go
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
's
the
meaning
of
it
all
?
''
demanded
Mrs.
Yeobright
haughtily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
seat
,
''
said
Wildeve
,
placing
chairs
for
the
two
women
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
it
was
a
very
stupid
mistake
,
but
such
mistakes
will
happen
.
The
*NL*
license
was
useless
at
Anglebury
.
It
was
made
out
for
Budmouth
,
but
*NL*
as
I
did
n't
read
it
I
was
n't
aware
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
had
been
staying
at
Anglebury
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
had
been
at
Budmouth
--
till
two
days
ago
--
and
that
was
where
I
*NL*
had
intended
to
take
her
;
but
when
I
came
to
fetch
her
we
decided
upon
*NL*
Anglebury
,
forgetting
that
a
new
license
would
be
necessary
.
There
was
*NL*
not
time
to
get
to
Budmouth
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
very
much
to
blame
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
quite
my
fault
we
chose
Anglebury
,
''
Thomasin
pleaded
.
``
I
*NL*
proposed
it
because
I
was
not
known
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
so
well
that
I
am
to
blame
that
you
need
not
remind
me
of
it
,
''
*NL*
replied
Wildeve
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
things
do
n't
happen
for
nothing
,
''
said
the
aunt
.
``
It
is
a
great
*NL*
slight
to
me
and
my
family
;
and
when
it
gets
known
there
will
be
a
*NL*
very
unpleasant
time
for
us
.
How
can
she
look
her
friends
in
the
face
*NL*
tomorrow
?
It
is
a
very
great
injury
,
and
one
I
can
not

*NL*
It
may
even
reflect
on
her
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
's
large
eyes
had
flown
from
the
face
of
one
to
the
face
of
*NL*
the
other
during
this
discussion
,
and
she
now
said
anxiously
,
``
Will
*NL*
you
allow
me
,
aunt
,
to
talk
it
over
alone
with
Damon
for
five
minutes
?
*NL*
Will
you
,
Damon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
dear
,
''
said
Wildeve
,
``
if
your
aunt
will
excuse
us

''
He
led
*NL*
her
into
an
adjoining
room
,
leaving
Mrs.
Yeobright
by
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
were
alone
,
and
the
door
closed
,
Thomasin
said
,
*NL*
turning
up
her
pale
,
tearful
face
to
him
,
``
It
is
killing
me
,
this
,
*NL*
Damon
!
I
did
not
mean
to
part
from
you
in
anger
at
Anglebury
this
*NL*
morning
;
but
I
was
frightened
,
and
hardly
knew
what
I
said
.
I
've
not
*NL*
let
aunt
know
how
much
I
have
suffered
to-day
;
and
it
is
so
hard
to
*NL*
command
my
face
and
voice
,
and
to
smile
as
if
it
were
a
slight
thing
*NL*
to
me
;
but
I
try
to
do
so
,
that
she
may
not
be
still
more
indignant
*NL*
with
you
.
I
know
you
could
not
help
it
,
dear
,
whatever
aunt
may
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
unpleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Thomasin
murmured
,
``
and
I
suppose
I
seem
so
now

Damon

what

you
mean
to
do
about

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
about
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Those
who
do
n't
like
you
whisper
things
which
at
moments
make
me
*NL*
doubt
you

We
mean
to
marry

I
suppose
,
do
n't
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
we
do

We
have
only
to
go
to
Budmouth
on
Monday
,
and
we
*NL*
marry
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
let
us
go
!
--
O
Damon
,
what
you
make
me
say
!
''
She
hid
her
*NL*
face
in
her
handkerchief
.
``
Here
am
I
asking
you
to
marry
me
,
when
*NL*
by
rights
you
ought
to
be
on
your
knees
imploring
me
,
your
cruel
*NL*
mistress
,
not
to
refuse
you
,
and
saying
it
would
break
your
heart
if
I
*NL*
did
.
I
used
to
think
it
would
be
pretty
and
sweet
like
that
;
but
how
*NL*
different
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
real
life
is
never
at
all
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
care
personally
if
it
never
takes
place
,
''
she
added
with
*NL*
a
little
dignity
;
``
no
,
I
can
live
without
you
.
It
is
aunt
I
think
of
.
*NL*
She
is
so
proud
,
and
thinks
so
much
of
her
family
respectability
,
*NL*
that
she
will
be
cut
down
with
mortification
if
this
story
should
*NL*
get
abroad
before
--
it
is
done
.
My
cousin
Clym
,
too
,
will
be
much
*NL*
wounded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
will
be
very
unreasonable
.
In
fact
,
you
are
all
rather
*NL*
unreasonable

*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
coloured
a
little
,
and
not
with
love
.
But
whatever
the
*NL*
momentary
feeling
which
caused
that
flush
in
her
,
it
went
as
it
came
,
*NL*
and
she
humbly
said
,
``
I
never
mean
to
be
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
I
merely
*NL*
feel
that
you
have
my
aunt
to
some
extent
in
your
power
at
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
matter
of
justice
it
is
almost
due
to
me
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
``
Think
*NL*
what
I
have
gone
through
to
win
her
consent
;
the
insult
that
it
is
*NL*
to
any
man
to
have
the
banns
forbidden
:
the
double
insult
to
a
man
*NL*
unlucky
enough
to
be
cursed
with
sensitiveness
,
and
blue
demons
,
*NL*
and
Heaven
knows
what
,
as
I
am
.
I
can
never
forget
those
banns
.
A
*NL*
harsher
man
would
rejoice
now
in
the
power
I
have
of
turning
upon
your
*NL*
aunt
by
going
no
further
in
the
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
wistfully
at
him
with
her
sorrowful
eyes
as
he
said
those
*NL*
words
,
and
her
aspect
showed
that
more
than
one
person
in
the
room
*NL*
could
deplore
the
possession
of
sensitiveness
.
Seeing
that
she
was
*NL*
really
suffering
he
seemed
disturbed
and
added
,
``
This
is
merely
a
*NL*
reflection
you
know
.
I
have
not
the
least
intention
to
refuse
to
*NL*
complete
the
marriage
,
Tamsie
mine
--
I
could
not
bear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
not
,
I
know
!
''
said
the
fair
girl
,
brightening
.
``
You
,
who
*NL*
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
pain
in
even
an
insect
,
or
any
disagreeable
*NL*
sound
,
or
unpleasant
smell
even
,
will
not
long
cause
pain
to
me
and
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
hand
upon
it
,
Damon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
carelessly
gave
her
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
by
my
crown
,
what
's
that
?
''
he
said
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
fell
upon
their
ears
the
sound
of
numerous
voices
singing
in
*NL*
front
of
the
house
.
Among
these
,
two
made
themselves
prominent
by
*NL*
their
peculiarity
:
one
was
a
very
strong
bass
,
the
other
a
wheezy
thin
*NL*
piping
.
Thomasin
recognized
them
as
belonging
to
Timothy
Fairway
and
*NL*
Grandfer
Cantle
respectively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
mean
--
it
is
not
skimmity-riding
,
I
hope
?
''
she
said
,
with
*NL*
a
frightened
gaze
at
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
;
no
,
it
is
that
the
heath-folk
have
come
to
sing
to
*NL*
us
a
welcome
.
This
is
intolerable
!
''
He
began
pacing
about
,
the
men
*NL*
outside
singing
cheerily
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
told
'
her
that
she

was
the
joy

of
his
life

*NL*
And
if

she
'd
con-sent

he
would
make
her
his

;
*NL*
She
could
'
not
refuse

him
;
to
church

so
they
went
'
,
*NL*
Young
Will
was
forgot

,
and
young
Sue

was
content

;
*NL*
And
then

was
she
kiss
'd
'
and
set
down
'
on
his
knee
'
,
*NL*
No

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
burst
in
from
the
outer
room
.
``
Thomasin
,
Thomasin
!
''
*NL*
she
said
,
looking
indignantly
at
Wildeve
;
``
here
's
a
pretty
exposure
!
*NL*
Let
us
escape
at
once
.
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
however
,
too
late
to
get
away
by
the
passage
.
A
rugged
*NL*
knocking
had
begun
upon
the
door
of
the
front
room
.
Wildeve
,
who
had
*NL*
gone
to
the
window
,
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
he
said
imperiously
,
putting
his
hand
upon
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
*NL*
arm
.
``
We
are
regularly
besieged
.
There
are
fifty
of
them
out
there
*NL*
if
there
's
one
.
You
stay
in
this
room
with
Thomasin
;
I
'll
go
out
and
*NL*
face
them
.
You
must
stay
now
,
for
my
sake
,
till
they
are
gone
,
so
*NL*
that
it
may
seem
as
if
all
was
right
.
Come
,
Tamsie
dear
,
do
n't
go
*NL*
making
a
scene
--
we
must
marry
after
this
;
that
you
can
see
as
well
as
*NL*
I.
Sit
still
,
that
's
all
--
and
do
n't
speak
much
.
I
'll
manage
them
.
*NL*
Blundering
fools
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
the
agitated
girl
into
a
seat
,
returned
to
the
outer
room
*NL*
and
opened
the
door
.
Immediately
outside
,
in
the
passage
,
appeared
*NL*
Grandfer
Cantle
singing
in
concert
with
those
still
standing
in
*NL*
front
of
the
house
.
He
came
into
the
room
and
nodded
abstractedly
*NL*
to
Wildeve
,
his
lips
still
parted
,
and
his
features
excruciatingly
*NL*
strained
in
the
emission
of
the
chorus
.
This
being
ended
,
he
said
*NL*
heartily
,
``
Here
's
welcome
to
the
newmade
couple
,
and
God
bless
'em
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Wildeve
,
with
dry
resentment
,
his
face
as
gloomy
as
*NL*
a
thunderstorm
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Grandfer
's
heels
now
came
the
rest
of
the
group
,
which
included
*NL*
Fairway
,
Christian
,
Sam
the
turf-cutter
,
Humphrey
,
and
a
dozen
others
.
*NL*
All
smiled
upon
Wildeve
,
and
upon
his
tables
and
chairs
likewise
,
*NL*
from
a
general
sense
of
friendliness
towards
the
articles
as
well
as
*NL*
towards
their
owner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
be
not
here
afore
Mrs.
Yeobright
after
all
,
''
said
Fairway
,
*NL*
recognizing
the
matron
's
bonnet
through
the
glass
partition
which
*NL*
divided
the
public
apartment
they
had
entered
from
the
room
where
the
*NL*
women
sat
.
``
We
struck
down
across
,
d'ye
see
,
Mr.
Wildeve
,
and
she
*NL*
went
round
by
the
path
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
see
the
young
bride
's
little
head
!
''
said
Grandfer
,
peeping
in
*NL*
the
same
direction
,
and
discerning
Thomasin
,
who
was
waiting
beside
*NL*
her
aunt
in
a
miserable
and
awkward
way
.
``
Not
quite
settled
in
*NL*
yet
--
well
,
well
,
there
's
plenty
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
made
no
reply
;
and
probably
feeling
that
the
sooner
he
treated
*NL*
them
the
sooner
they
would
go
,
he
produced
a
stone
jar
,
which
threw
a
*NL*
warm
halo
over
matters
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
drop
of
the
right
sort
,
I
can
see
,
''
said
Grandfer
Cantle
,
*NL*
with
the
air
of
a
man
too
well-mannered
to
show
any
hurry
to
taste
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Wildeve
,
''
't
is
some
old
mead
.
I
hope
you
will
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
ay
!
''
replied
the
guests
,
in
the
hearty
tones
natural
when
the
words
*NL*
demanded
by
politeness
coincide
with
those
of
deepest
feeling
.
``
There
*NL*
is
n't
a
prettier
drink
under
the
sun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
take
my
oath

added
Grandfer
Cantle
.
``
All
that
can
*NL*
be
said
against
mead
is
that

is
rather
heady

apt
to
lie
about
a
*NL*
man
a
good
while

But
tomorrow
's
Sunday

thank
God

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel

for
all
the

bold

had
had
*NL*
some
once

said
Christian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
feel

again

Wildeve
,
with
condescension

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Jown

Grandfer
Cantle

``
Right

said
Sam
;
and
the
mead
then
circulated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Timothy
Fairway
,
feeling
demands
upon
his
praise
in
some
*NL*
form
or
other
,

't
is
a
worthy
thing
to
be

a
dimant

I.
Yes

he
continued
,
to
*NL*
Grandfer
Cantle
,
raising
his
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
through
the
*NL*
partition
,
``
her
father
-LRB-
inclining
his
head
towards
the
inner
room
-RRB-
was
*NL*
as
good
a
feller

ever
lived

He
always
had
his
great
indignation
*NL*
ready
against
anything
underhand

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
very
dangerous
?

said
Christian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
were
few
in
these
parts
that

Sam

Whenever
a

walked
he

anything

then

he

throw
down

mount

away

*NL*
``
I
can

opening
a

Wildeve
breathed
the
breath

intolerably
bored

glanced

through

partition
at

said
Grandfer
Cantle
,
the
other
listeners
*NL*
expressing
the
same
accord
by
the
shorter
way
of
nodding
their
heads
.

*NL*
``
No
sooner
was
Andrey
asleep
and
the
first
whiff
of
neighbour
*NL*
Yeobright
's
wind
had
got
inside
Andrey
's
clarinet
than
everyone
in
*NL*
church
feeled
in
a
moment
there
was
a
great
soul
among
'em
.
All
heads
*NL*
would
turn
,
and
they
'd
say
,
`
Ah
,
I
thought
't
was
he
!
'
One
Sunday
I
can
*NL*
well
mind
--
a
bass-viol
day
that
time
,
and
Yeobright
had
brought
his
*NL*
own
.
'T
was
the
Hundred-and-thirty-third
to
`
Lydia
'
;
and
when
they
'd
*NL*
come
to

Ran
down
his
beard
and
o'er
his
robes
its
costly
moisture
*NL*
shed

neighbour
Yeobright
,
who
had
just
warmed
to
his
work

drove
his
*NL*
bow
into
them
strings
that
glorious
grand
that
he
e
`
en
a
`
most
sawed
*NL*
the
bass-viol
into
two
pieces
.
Every
winder
in
church
rattled
as
if
*NL*
`
twere
a
thunderstorm
.
Old
Pa
`
son
Williams
lifted
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
great
holy
surplice
as
natural
as
if
he
'd
been
in
common
clothes
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
say
to
hisself
,
'
O
for
such
a
man
in
our
parish
!
'
But
not
a
*NL*
soul
in
Kingsbere
could
hold
a
candle
to
Yeobright

*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
quite
safe
when
the
winder
shook
?
''
Christian
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
received
no
answer
,
all
for
the
moment
sitting
rapt
in
admiration
*NL*
of
the
performance
described
.
As
with
Farinelli
's
singing
before
the
*NL*
princesses
,
Sheridan
's
renowned
Begum
Speech
,
and
other
such
examples
,
*NL*
the
fortunate
condition
of
its
being
for
ever
lost
to
the
world
*NL*
invested
the
deceased
Mr.
Yeobright
's
_
tour
de
force
_
on
that
*NL*
memorable
afternoon
with
a
cumulative
glory
which
comparative
*NL*
criticism
,
had
that
been
possible
,
might
considerably
have
shorn
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
the
last
you
'd
have
expected
to
drop
off
in
the
prime
of
*NL*
life
,
''
said
Humphrey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
:
he
was
looking
for
the
earth
some
months
afore
he
went
.
At
*NL*
that
time
women
used
to
run
for
smocks
and
gown-pieces
at
Greenhill
*NL*
Fair
,
and
my
wife
that
is
now
,
being
a
long-legged
slittering
maid
,
*NL*
hardly
husband-high

went
with
the
rest
of
the
maidens
,
for

a
was
*NL*
a
good
runner
afore
she
got
so
heavy
.
When
she
came
home
I
said
--
we
*NL*
were
then
just
beginning
to
walk
together

`
What
have
ye
got
,
my
*NL*
honey

I
've
won

a
gown-piece

says
she
,
her
*NL*
colours
coming
up
in
a
moment

'T
is
a
smock
for
a
crown

I
thought
;

and
so
it
turned
out
.
Ay
,
when
I
think
what
she
'll
say
to
me
now
*NL*
without
a
mossel
of
red
in
her
face
,
it
do
seem
strange
that
'
a
*NL*
would
n't
say
such
a
little
thing
then
...
However
,
then
she
went
on
,
*NL*
and
that
's
what
made
me
bring
up
the
story
.
`
Well
,
whatever
clothes
*NL*
I
've
won

white

figured

for

could
do
a

stroke
of
modesty
in
those
days
-RRB-
,

I
'd
sooner
*NL*
have
lost
it
than
have
seen
what
I
have

Poor
Mr.
Yeobright
was
took
*NL*
bad
directly
he
reached
the
fair
ground
,
and
was
forced
to
go
home
*NL*
again

That
was
the
last
time
he
ever
went
out
of
the
parish

A
faltered
on
from
one
day
to
another

then
we
heard
he
was

gone

*NL*
*NL*
``
D'ye
think
he
had
great
pain
when

died

said
Christian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
:
quite
different

Nor
any

He

lucky

*NL*

``
And

*NL*

``
That
depends
on
whether

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Christian
strenuously

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
solemn
silence
,
and
looking
from
the
window
,
which
was
*NL*
unshuttered
and
unblinded
,
Timothy
said
,
``
Well

bonfire

out

burning
just
the

*NL*
now
as
ever

*NL*
*NL*
All
glances
went
through
the
window
,
and
nobody
noticed
that
Wildeve
*NL*
disguised
a
brief
,
telltale
look
.
Far
away
up
the
sombre
valley
of
*NL*
heath
,
and
to
the
right
of
Rainbarrow
,
could
indeed
be
seen
the
light
,
*NL*
small
,
but
steady
and
persistent
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
lighted
before
ours
was
,

Fairway
continued
;
``
and
yet
every
*NL*
one
in
the
country
round
is
out
afore

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
there
's
meaning
in
it
!

murmured
Christian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
meaning
?
''
said
Wildeve
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Christian
was
too
scattered
to
reply
,
and
Timothy
helped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
means

that
the
lonesome
dark-eyed
creature
up
there

ever
I

call

fine
young
woman

always
up
to
some
odd
conceit

other
;

so
perhaps

is
*NL*
she
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

be

glad

the
risk
of
her
wild
dark
eyes
ill-wishing
me

said
Grandfer
Cantle
*NL*
staunchly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ye
say
it

father
!
''
implored
Christian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
said
Fairway
in
a
liquid
tone
,
placing
*NL*
down
the
cup
of
mead
at
the
end
of
a
good
pull
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
partner
as
deep
as

North
Star

said
Sam
,
taking
up
the
cup
*NL*
and
finishing
the
little
that
remained
.
``
Well
,
really
,
now
I
think
we
*NL*
must
be
moving

said
Humphrey
,
observing
the
emptiness
of
the
vessel
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
'll
gie
'em
another
song
?

said
Grandfer
Cantle
.
``

as
full
*NL*
of
notes
as
a
bird
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Grandfer
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
``
But
we
will
not
trouble
you
*NL*
now
.
Some
other
day
must
do
for
that
--
when
I
have
a
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
jown
'd
if
I
do
n't
learn
ten
new
songs
for
`

or
I
wo
n't
learn
a
*NL*
line
!

said
Grandfer
Cantle
.
``
And
you
may
be
sure
I
wo
n't
disappoint
*NL*
ye
by
biding
away
,
Mr.
Wildeve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
believe
you
,
''
said
that
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
then
took
their
leave
,
wishing
their
entertainer
long
life
and
*NL*
happiness
as
a
married
man
,
with
recapitulations
which
occupied
some
*NL*
time
.
Wildeve
attended
them
to
the
door
,
beyond
which
the
deep-dyed
*NL*
upward
stretch
of
heath
stood
awaiting
them
,
an
amplitude
of
darkness
*NL*
reigning
from
their
feet
almost
to
the
zenith
,
where
a
definite
form
*NL*
first
became
visible
in
the
lowering
forehead
of
Rainbarrow
.
Diving
*NL*
into
the
dense
obscurity
in
a
line
headed
by
Sam
the
turf-cutter
,
they
*NL*
pursued
their
trackless
way
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
scratching
of
the
furze
against
their
leggings
had
fainted
*NL*
upon
the
ear
,
Wildeve
returned
to
the
room
where
he
had
left
Thomasin
*NL*
and
her
aunt
.
The
women
were
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
could
only
have
left
the
house
in
one
way
,
by
the
back
window
;
*NL*
and
this
was
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
laughed
to
himself
,
remained
a
moment
thinking
,
and
idly
*NL*
returned
to
the
front
room
.
Here
his
glance
fell
upon
a
bottle
of
*NL*
wine
which
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
.
``
Ah
--
old
Dowden
!
''
he
murmured
;
*NL*
and
going
to
the
kitchen
door
shouted
,
``
Is
anybody
here
who
can
take
*NL*
something
to
old
Dowden
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reply
.
The
room
was
empty
,
the
lad
who
acted
as
his
*NL*
factotum
having
gone
to
bed
.
Wildeve
came
back
put
on
his
hat
,
took
*NL*
the
bottle
,
and
left
the
house
,
turning
the
key
in
the
door
,
for
there
*NL*
was
no
guest
at
the
inn
tonight
.
As
soon
as
he
was
on
the
road
the
*NL*
little
bonfire
on
Mistover
Knap
again
met
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
waiting
,
are
you
,
my
lady
?
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
did
not
proceed
that
way
just
then
;
but
leaving
the
hill
*NL*
to
the
left
of
him
,
he
stumbled
over
a
rutted
road
that
brought
him
to
*NL*
a
cottage
which
,
like
all
other
habitations
on
the
heath
at
this
hour
,
*NL*
was
only
saved
from
being
visible
by
a
faint
shine
from
its
bedroom
*NL*
window
.
This
house
was
the
home
of
Olly
Dowden
,
the
besom-maker
,
and
*NL*
he
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lower
room
was
in
darkness
;
but
by
feeling
his
way
he
found
a
*NL*
table
,
whereon
he
placed
the
bottle
,
and
a
minute
later
emerged
again
*NL*
upon
the
heath
.
He
stood
and
looked
north-east
at
the
undying
little
*NL*
fire
--
high
up
above
him
,
though
not
so
high
as
Rainbarrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
been
told
what
happens
when
a
woman
deliberates
;
and
the
*NL*
epigram
is
not
always
terminable
with
woman
,
provided
that
one
be
in
*NL*
the
case
,
and
that
a
fair
one
.
Wildeve
stood
,
and
stood
longer
,
and
*NL*
breathed
perplexedly
,
and
then
said
to
himself
with
resignation
,
*NL*
``
Yes
--
by
Heaven
,
I
must
go
to
her
,
I
suppose
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
turning
in
the
direction
of
home
he
pressed
on
rapidly
by
a
*NL*
path
under
Rainbarrow
towards
what
was
evidently
a
signal
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
The
Figure
against
the
Sky
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
whole
Egdon
concourse
had
left
the
site
of
the
bonfire
to
its
*NL*
accustomed
loneliness
,
a
closely
wrapped
female
figure
approached
the
*NL*
barrow
from
that
quarter
of
the
heath
in
which
the
little
fire
lay
.
*NL*
Had
the
reddleman
been
watching
he
might
have
recognized
her
as
the
*NL*
woman
who
had
first
stood
there
so
singularly
,
and
vanished
at
the
*NL*
approach
of
strangers
.
She
ascended
to
her
old
position
at
the
top
,
*NL*
where
the
red
coals
of
the
perishing
fire
greeted
her
like
living
eyes
*NL*
in
the
corpse
of
day
.
There
she
stood
still
,
around
her
stretching
the
*NL*
vast
night
atmosphere
,
whose
incomplete
darkness
in
comparison
with
*NL*
the
total
darkness
of
the
heath
below
it
might
have
represented
a
*NL*
venial
beside
a
mortal
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
she
was
tall
and
straight
in
build
,
that
she
was
lady-like
in
*NL*
her
movements
,
was
all
that
could
be
learnt
of
her
just
now
,
her
form
*NL*
being
wrapped
in
a
shawl
folded
in
the
old
cornerwise
fashion
,
and
*NL*
her
head
in
a
large
kerchief
,
a
protection
not
superfluous
at
this
*NL*
hour
and
place
.
Her
back
was
towards
the
wind
,
which
blew
from
the
*NL*
north-west
;
but
whether
she
had
avoided
that
aspect
because
of
the
*NL*
chilly
gusts
which
played
about
her
exceptional
position
,
or
because
*NL*
her
interest
lay
in
the
south-east
,
did
not
at
first
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
reason
for
standing
so
dead
still
as
the
pivot
of
this
circle
*NL*
of
heath-country
was
just
as
obscure
.
Her
extraordinary
fixity
,
her
*NL*
conspicuous
loneliness
,
her
heedlessness
of
night
,
betokened
among
*NL*
other
things
an
utter
absence
of
fear
.
A
tract
of
country
unaltered
*NL*
from
that
sinister
condition
which
made
Caesar
anxious
every
year
*NL*
to
get
clear
of
its
glooms
before
the
autumnal
equinox
,
a
kind
of
*NL*
landscape
and
weather
which
leads
travellers
from
the
South
to
*NL*
describe
our
island
as
Homer
's
Cimmerian
land
,
was
not
,
on
the
face
*NL*
of
it
,
friendly
to
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
reasonably
have
been
supposed
that
she
was
listening
to
the
*NL*
wind
,
which
rose
somewhat
as
the
night
advanced
,
and
laid
hold
of
the
*NL*
attention
.
The
wind
,
indeed
,
seemed
made
for
the
scene
,
as
the
scene
*NL*
seemed
made
for
the
hour
.
Part
of
its
tone
was
quite
special
;
what
*NL*
was
heard
there
could
be
heard
nowhere
else
.
Gusts
in
innumerable
*NL*
series
followed
each
other
from
the
north-west
,
and
when
each
one
*NL*
of
them
raced
past
the
sound
of
its
progress
resolved
into
three
.
*NL*
Treble
,
tenor
,
and
bass
notes
were
to
be
found
therein
.
The
general
*NL*
ricochet
of
the
whole
over
pits
and
prominences
had
the
gravest
pitch
*NL*
of
the
chime
.
Next
there
could
be
heard
the
baritone
buzz
of
a
holly
*NL*
tree
.
Below
these
in
force
,
above
them
in
pitch
,
a
dwindled
voice
*NL*
strove
hard
at
a
husky
tune
,
which
was
the
peculiar
local
sound
*NL*
alluded
to
.
Thinner
and
less
immediately
traceable
than
the
other
*NL*
two
,
it
was
far
more
impressive
than
either
.
In
it
lay
what
may
be
*NL*
called
the
linguistic
peculiarity
of
the
heath
;
and
being
audible
*NL*
nowhere
on
earth
off
a
heath
,
it
afforded
a
shadow
of
reason
for
the
*NL*
woman
's
tenseness
,
which
continued
as
unbroken
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
the
blowing
of
these
plaintive
November
winds
that
note
*NL*
bore
a
great
resemblance
to
the
ruins
of
human
song
which
remain
*NL*
to
the
throat
of
fourscore
and
ten
.
It
was
a
worn
whisper
,
dry
and
*NL*
papery
,
and
it
brushed
so
distinctly
across
the
ear
that
,
by
the
*NL*
accustomed
,
the
material
minutiae
in
which
it
originated
could
be
*NL*
realized
as
by
touch
.
It
was
the
united
products
of
infinitesimal
*NL*
vegetable
causes
,
and
these
were
neither
stems
,
leaves
,
fruit
,
blades
,
*NL*
prickles
,
lichen
,
nor
moss
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
the
mummied
heath-bells
of
the
past
summer
,
originally
*NL*
tender
and
purple
,
now
washed
colourless
by
Michaelmas
rains
,
and
*NL*
dried
to
dead
skins
by
October
suns
.
So
low
was
an
individual
sound
*NL*
from
these
that
a
combination
of
hundreds
only
just
emerged
from
*NL*
silence
,
and
the
myriads
of
the
whole
declivity
reached
the
woman
's
*NL*
ear
but
as
a
shrivelled
and
intermittent
recitative
.
Yet
scarcely
a
*NL*
single
accent
among
the
many
afloat
to-night
could
have
such
power
to
*NL*
impress
a
listener
with
thoughts
of
its
origin
.
One
inwardly
saw
the
*NL*
infinity
of
those
combined
multitudes
;
and
perceived
that
each
of
the
*NL*
tiny
trumpets
was
seized
on
,
entered
,
scoured
and
emerged
from
by
the
*NL*
wind
as
thoroughly
as
if
it
were
as
vast
as
a
crater
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
spirit
moved
them
.
''
A
meaning
of
the
phrase
forced
itself
upon
*NL*
the
attention
;
and
an
emotional
listener
's
fetichistic
mood
might
have
*NL*
ended
in
one
of
more
advanced
quality
.
It
was
not
,
after
all
,
that
*NL*
the
left-hand
expanse
of
old
blooms
spoke
,
or
the
right-hand
,
or
those
*NL*
of
the
slope
in
front
;
but
it
was
the
single
person
of
something
else
*NL*
speaking
through
each
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
on
the
barrow
,
there
mingled
with
all
this
wild
rhetoric
*NL*
of
night
a
sound
which
modulated
so
naturally
into
the
rest
that
its
*NL*
beginning
and
ending
were
hardly
to
be
distinguished
.
The
bluffs
,
and
*NL*
the
bushes
,
and
the
heather-bells
had
broken
silence
;
at
last
,
so
did
*NL*
the
woman
;
and
her
articulation
was
but
as
another
phrase
of
the
same
*NL*
discourse
as
theirs
.
Thrown
out
on
the
winds
it
became
twined
in
with
*NL*
them
,
and
with
them
it
flew
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
she
uttered
was
a
lengthened
sighing
,
apparently
at
something
in
*NL*
her
mind
which
had
led
to
her
presence
here
.
There
was
a
spasmodic
*NL*
abandonment
about
it
as
if
,
in
allowing
herself
to
utter
the
sound
.
*NL*
the
woman
's
brain
had
authorized
what
it
could
not
regulate
.
One
*NL*
point
was
evident
in
this
;
that
she
had
been
existing
in
a
suppressed
*NL*
state
,
and
not
in
one
of
languor
,
or
stagnation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Far
away
down
the
valley
the
faint
shine
from
the
window
of
the
inn
*NL*
still
lasted
on
;
and
a
few
additional
moments
proved
that
the
window
,
*NL*
or
what
was
within
it
,
had
more
to
do
with
the
woman
's
sigh
than
had
*NL*
either
her
own
actions
or
the
scene
immediately
around
.
She
lifted
*NL*
her
left
hand
,
which
held
a
closed
telescope
.
This
she
rapidly
*NL*
extended
,
as
if
she
were
well
accustomed
to
the
operation
,
and
raising
*NL*
it
to
her
eye
directed
it
towards
the
light
beaming
from
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
handkerchief
which
had
hooded
her
head
was
now
a
little
thrown
*NL*
back
,
her
face
being
somewhat
elevated
.
A
profile
was
visible
against
*NL*
the
dull
monochrome
of
cloud
around
her
;
and
it
was
as
though
side
*NL*
shadows
from
the
features
of
Sappho
and
Mrs.
Siddons
had
converged
*NL*
upwards
from
the
tomb
to
form
an
image
like
neither
but
suggesting
*NL*
both
.
This
,
however
,
was
mere
superficiality
.
In
respect
of
*NL*
character
a
face
may
make
certain
admissions
by
its
outline
;
but
*NL*
it
fully
confesses
only
in
its
changes
.
So
much
is
this
the
case
*NL*
that
what
is
called
the
play
of
the
features
often
helps
more
in
*NL*
understanding
a
man
or
woman
than
the
earnest
labours
of
all
the
other
*NL*
members
together
.
Thus
the
night
revealed
little
of
her
whose
form
it
*NL*
was
embracing
,
for
the
mobile
parts
of
her
countenance
could
not
be
*NL*
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
she
gave
up
her
spying
attitude
,
closed
the
telescope
,
and
*NL*
turned
to
the
decaying
embers
.
From
these
no
appreciable
beams
now
*NL*
radiated
,
except
when
a
more
than
usually
smart
gust
brushed
over
*NL*
their
faces
and
raised
a
fitful
glow
which
came
and
went
like
the
*NL*
blush
of
a
girl
.
She
stooped
over
the
silent
circle
,
and
selecting
*NL*
from
the
brands
a
piece
of
stick
which
bore
the
largest
live
coal
at
*NL*
its
end
,
brought
it
to
where
she
had
been
standing
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
the
brand
to
the
ground
,
blowing
the
red
coal
with
her
mouth
*NL*
at
the
same
time
;
till
it
faintly
illuminated
the
sod
,
and
revealed
*NL*
a
small
object
,
which
turned
out
to
be
an
hourglass
,
though
she
wore
*NL*
a
watch
.
She
blew
long
enough
to
show
that
the
sand
had
all
slipped
*NL*
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
said
,
as
if
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
raised
by
her
breath
had
been
very
fitful
,
and
a
momentary
*NL*
irradiation
of
flesh
was
all
that
it
had
disclosed
of
her
face
.
That
*NL*
consisted
of
two
matchless
lips
and
a
cheek
only
,
her
head
being
still
*NL*
enveloped
.
She
threw
away
the
stick
,
took
the
glass
in
her
hand
,
the
*NL*
telescope
under
her
arm
,
and
moved
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Along
the
ridge
ran
a
faint
foot-track
,
which
the
lady
followed
.
*NL*
Those
who
knew
it
well
called
it
a
path
;
and
,
while
a
mere
visitor
*NL*
would
have
passed
it
unnoticed
even
by
day
,
the
regular
haunters
of
*NL*
the
heath
were
at
no
loss
for
it
at
midnight
.
The
whole
secret
of
*NL*
following
these
incipient
paths
,
when
there
was
not
light
enough
in
*NL*
the
atmosphere
to
show
a
turnpike-road
,
lay
in
the
development
of
the
*NL*
sense
of
touch
in
the
feet
,
which
comes
with
years
of
night-rambling
*NL*
in
little-trodden
spots
.
To
a
walker
practised
in
such
places
a
*NL*
difference
between
impact
on
maiden
herbage
,
and
on
the
crippled
*NL*
stalks
of
a
slight
footway
,
is
perceptible
through
the
thickest
boot
*NL*
or
shoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
solitary
figure
who
walked
this
beat
took
no
notice
of
the
windy
*NL*
tune
still
played
on
the
dead
heath-bells
.
She
did
not
turn
her
head
*NL*
to
look
at
a
group
of
dark
creatures
further
on
,
who
fled
from
her
*NL*
presence
as
she
skirted
a
ravine
where
they
fed
.
They
were
about
a
*NL*
score
of
the
small
wild
ponies
known
as
heath-croppers
.
They
roamed
at
*NL*
large
on
the
undulations
of
Egdon
,
but
in
numbers
too
few
to
detract
*NL*
much
from
the
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pedestrian
noticed
nothing
just
now
,
and
a
clue
to
her
abstraction
*NL*
was
afforded
by
a
trivial
incident
.
A
bramble
caught
hold
of
her
*NL*
skirt
,
and
checked
her
progress
.
Instead
of
putting
it
off
and
*NL*
hastening
along
,
she
yielded
herself
up
to
the
pull
,
and
stood
*NL*
passively
still
.
When
she
began
to
extricate
herself
it
was
by
*NL*
turning
round
and
round
,
and
so
unwinding
the
prickly
switch
.
She
was
*NL*
in
a
desponding
reverie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
course
was
in
the
direction
of
the
small
undying
fire
which
had
*NL*
drawn
the
attention
of
the
men
on
Rainbarrow
and
of
Wildeve
in
the
*NL*
valley
below
.
A
faint
illumination
from
its
rays
began
to
glow
upon
*NL*
her
face
,
and
the
fire
soon
revealed
itself
to
be
lit
,
not
on
the
*NL*
level
ground
,
but
on
a
salient
corner
or
redan
of
earth
,
at
the
*NL*
junction
of
two
converging
bank
fences
.
Outside
was
a
ditch
,
dry
*NL*
except
immediately
under
the
fire
,
where
there
was
a
large
pool
,
*NL*
bearded
all
round
by
heather
and
rushes
.
In
the
smooth
water
of
the
*NL*
pool
the
fire
appeared
upside
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
banks
meeting
behind
were
bare
of
a
hedge
,
save
such
as
was
formed
*NL*
by
disconnected
tufts
of
furze
,
standing
upon
stems
along
the
top
,
*NL*
like
impaled
heads
above
a
city
wall
.
A
white
mast
,
fitted
up
with
*NL*
spars
and
other
nautical
tackle
,
could
be
seen
rising
against
the
*NL*
dark
clouds
whenever
the
flames
played
brightly
enough
to
reach
it
.
*NL*
Altogether
the
scene
had
much
the
appearance
of
a
fortification
upon
*NL*
which
had
been
kindled
a
beacon
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
was
visible
;
but
ever
and
anon
a
whitish
something
moved
above
*NL*
the
bank
from
behind
,
and
vanished
again
.
This
was
a
small
human
*NL*
hand
,
in
the
act
of
lifting
pieces
of
fuel
into
the
fire
;
but
for
all
*NL*
that
could
be
seen
the
hand
,
like
that
which
troubled
Belshazzar
,
was
*NL*
there
alone
.
Occasionally
an
ember
rolled
off
the
bank
,
and
dropped
*NL*
with
a
hiss
into
the
pool
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
side
of
the
pool
rough
steps
built
of
clods
enabled
any
one
*NL*
who
wished
to
do
so
to
mount
the
bank
;
which
the
woman
did
.
Within
*NL*
was
a
paddock
in
an
uncultivated
state
,
though
bearing
evidence
of
*NL*
having
once
been
tilled
;
but
the
heath
and
fern
had
insidiously
crept
*NL*
in
,
and
were
reasserting
their
old
supremacy
.
Further
ahead
were
*NL*
dimly
visible
an
irregular
dwelling-house
,
garden
,
and
outbuildings
,
*NL*
backed
by
a
clump
of
firs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
--
for
youth
had
revealed
its
presence
in
her
buoyant
*NL*
bound
up
the
bank
--
walked
along
the
top
instead
of
descending
inside
,
*NL*
and
came
to
the
corner
where
the
fire
was
burning
.
One
reason
for
the
*NL*
permanence
of
the
blaze
was
now
manifest
:
the
fuel
consisted
of
hard
*NL*
pieces
of
wood
,
cleft
and
sawn
--
the
knotty
boles
of
old
thorn
trees
*NL*
which
grew
in
twos
and
threes
about
the
hillsides
.
A
yet
unconsumed
*NL*
pile
of
these
lay
in
the
inner
angle
of
the
bank
;
and
from
this
corner
*NL*
the
upturned
face
of
a
little
boy
greeted
her
eves
.
He
was
dilatorily
*NL*
throwing
up
a
piece
of
wood
into
the
fire
every
now
and
then
,
a
*NL*
business
which
seemed
to
have
engaged
him
a
considerable
part
of
the
*NL*
evening
,
for
his
face
was
somewhat
weary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
have
come
,
Miss
Eustacia
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
sigh
of
*NL*
relief
.
``
I
do
n't
like
biding
by
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
.
I
have
only
been
a
little
way
for
a
walk
.
I
have
been
gone
*NL*
only
twenty
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seemed
long
,
''
murmured
the
sad
boy
.
``
And
you
have
been
so
many
*NL*
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
thought
you
would
be
pleased
to
have
a
bonfire
.
Are
you
not
*NL*
much
obliged
to
me
for
making
you
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
there
's
nobody
here
to
play
wi
'
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
nobody
has
come
while
I
've
been
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
except
your
grandfather
:
he
looked
out
of
doors
once
for

ee

*NL*
I
told
him
you
were
walking
round
upon
the
hill
to
look
at
the
other
*NL*
bonfires

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
hear
him
coming
again
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
man
came
into
the
remoter
light
of
the
fire
from
the
direction
*NL*
of
the
homestead
.
He
was
the
same
who
had
overtaken
the
reddleman
on
*NL*
the
road
that
afternoon
.
He
looked
wistfully
to
the
top
of
the
bank
at
*NL*
the
woman
who
stood
there
,
and
his
teeth
,
which
were
quite
unimpaired
,
*NL*
showed
like
parian
from
his
parted
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
are
you
coming
indoors
,
Eustacia
?
''
he
asked
.
''
'T
is
almost
*NL*
bedtime
.
I
've
been
home
these
two
hours
,
and
am
tired
out

Surely
*NL*
't
is
somewhat
childish
of
you
to
stay
out
playing
at
bonfires
so
long
,
*NL*
and
wasting
such
fuel
.
My
precious
thorn
roots
,
the
rarest
of
all
*NL*
firing
,
that
I
laid
by
on
purpose
for
Christmas
--
you
have
burnt
'em
*NL*
nearly
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promised
Johnny
a
bonfire
,
and
it
pleases
him
not
to
let
it
go
out
*NL*
just
yet

''
said
Eustacia
,
in
a
way
which
told
at
once
that
she
was
*NL*
absolute
queen
here
.
``
Grandfather
,
you
go
in
to
bed
.
I
shall
follow
*NL*
you
soon
.
You
like
the
fire
,

n't
you
,
Johnny
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
looked
up
doubtfully
at
her
and
murmured
,
``
I
do
n't
think
I
*NL*
want
it
any
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
grandfather
had
turned
back
again
,
and
did
not
hear
the
boy
's
*NL*
reply
.
As
soon
as
the
white-haired
man
had
vanished
she
said
in
a
*NL*
tone
of
pique
to
the
child
,
``
Ungrateful
little
boy
,
how
can
you
*NL*
contradict
me
?
Never
shall
you
have
a
bonfire
again
unless
you
keep
*NL*
it
up
now
.
Come
,
tell
me
you
like
to
do
things
for
me
,
and
do
n't
deny
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
repressed
child
said
,
``
Yes
,
I
do
,
miss
,
''
and
continued
to
stir
the
*NL*
fire
perfunctorily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
a
little
longer
and
I
will
give
you
a
crooked
six-pence
,
''
said
*NL*
Eustacia
,
more
gently
.
``
Put
in
one
piece
of
wood
every
two
or
three
*NL*
minutes
,
but
not
too
much
at
once
.
I
am
going
to
walk
along
the
ridge
*NL*
a
little
longer
,
but
I
shall
keep
on
coming
to
you
.
And
if
you
hear
a
*NL*
frog
jump
into
the
pond
with
a
flounce
like
a
stone
thrown
in
,
be
sure
*NL*
you
run
and
tell
me
,
because
it
is
a
sign
of
rain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Eustacia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Vye
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Vy
--
stacia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
.
Now
put
in
one
stick
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
slave
went
on
feeding
the
fire
as
before
.
He
seemed
a
*NL*
mere
automaton
,
galvanized
into
moving
and
speaking
by
the
wayward
*NL*
Eustacia
's
will
.
He
might
have
been
the
brass
statue
which
Albertus
*NL*
Magnus
is
said
to
have
animated
just
so
far
as
to
make
it
chatter
,
*NL*
and
move
,
and
be
his
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
going
on
her
walk
again
the
young
girl
stood
still
on
the
*NL*
bank
for
a
few
instants
and
listened
.
It
was
to
the
full
as
lonely
a
*NL*
place
as
Rainbarrow
,
though
at
rather
a
lower
level
;
and
it
was
more
*NL*
sheltered
from
wind
and
weather
on
account
of
the
few
firs
to
the
*NL*
north
.
The
bank
which
enclosed
the
homestead
,
and
protected
it
from
*NL*
the
lawless
state
of
the
world
without
,
was
formed
of
thick
square
*NL*
clods
,
dug
from
the
ditch
on
the
outside
,
and
built
up
with
a
slight
*NL*
batter
or
incline
,
which
forms
no
slight
defense
where
hedges
will
not
*NL*
grow
because
of
the
wind
and
the
wilderness
,
and
where
wall
materials
*NL*
are
unattainable
.
Otherwise
the
situation
was
quite
open
,
commanding
*NL*
the
whole
length
of
the
valley
which
reached
to
the
river
behind
*NL*
Wildeve
's
house
.
High
above
this
to
the
right
,
and
much
nearer
*NL*
thitherward
than
the
Quiet
Woman
Inn
,
the
blurred
contour
of
*NL*
Rainbarrow
obstructed
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
her
attentive
survey
of
the
wild
slopes
and
hollow
ravines
a
*NL*
gesture
of
impatience
escaped
Eustacia
.
She
vented
petulant
words
*NL*
every
now
and
then
,
but
there
were
sighs
between
her
words
,
and
sudden
*NL*
listenings
between
her
sighs
.
Descending
from
her
perch
she
again
*NL*
sauntered
off
towards
Rainbarrow
,
though
this
time
she
did
not
go
the
*NL*
whole
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twice
she
reappeared
at
intervals
of
a
few
minutes
and
each
time
she
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
any
flounce
into
the
pond
yet
,
little
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Miss
Eustacia
,
''
the
child
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
``
I
shall
soon
be
going
in
,
and
then
I
will
*NL*
give
you
the
crooked
sixpence
,
and
let
you
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
`
ee
,
Miss
Eustacia
,
''
said
the
tired
stoker
,
breathing
more
*NL*
easily
.
And
Eustacia
again
strolled
away
from
the
fire
,
but
this
time
*NL*
not
towards
Rainbarrow
.
She
skirted
the
bank
and
went
round
to
the
*NL*
wicket
before
the
house
,
where
she
stood
motionless
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fifty
yards
off
rose
the
corner
of
the
two
converging
banks
,
with
the
*NL*
fire
upon
it
;
within
the
bank
,
lifting
up
to
the
fire
one
stick
at
*NL*
a
time
,
just
as
before
,
the
figure
of
the
little
child
.
She
idly
*NL*
watched
him
as
he
occasionally
climbed
up
in
the
nook
of
the
bank
and
*NL*
stood
beside
the
brands
.
The
wind
blew
the
smoke
,
and
the
child
's
*NL*
hair
,
and
the
corner
of
his
pinafore
,
all
in
the
same
direction
;
the
*NL*
breeze
died
,
and
the
pinafore
and
hair
lay
still
,
and
the
smoke
went
*NL*
up
straight
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Eustacia
looked
on
from
this
distance
the
boy
's
form
visibly
*NL*
started
:
he
slid
down
the
bank
and
ran
across
towards
the
white
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hop-frog
have
jumped
into
the
pond
.
Yes
,
I
heard
`
en
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
going
to
rain
,
and
you
had
better
go
home
.
You
will
not
*NL*
be
afraid
?
''
She
spoke
hurriedly
,
as
if
her
heart
had
leapt
into
her
*NL*
throat
at
the
boy
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
because
I
shall
hae
the
crooked
sixpence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
here
it
is
.
Now
run
as
fast
as
you
can
--
not
that
way
--
through
*NL*
the
garden
here
.
No
other
boy
in
the
heath
has
had
such
a
bonfire
as
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
,
who
clearly
had
had
too
much
of
a
good
thing
,
marched
away
*NL*
into
the
shadows
with
alacrity
.
When
he
was
gone
Eustacia
,
leaving
*NL*
her
telescope
and
hour-glass
by
the
gate
,
brushed
forward
from
the
*NL*
wicket
towards
the
angle
of
the
bank
,
under
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
screened
by
the
outwork
,
she
waited
.
In
a
few
moments
a
splash
*NL*
was
audible
from
the
pond
outside
.
Had
the
child
been
there
he
would
*NL*
have
said
that
a
second
frog
had
jumped
in
;
but
by
most
people
the
*NL*
sound
would
have
been
likened
to
the
fall
of
a
stone
into
the
water
.
*NL*
Eustacia
stepped
upon
the
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
she
said
,
and
held
her
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
the
contour
of
a
man
became
dimly
visible
against
the
*NL*
low-reaching
sky
over
the
valley
,
beyond
the
outer
margin
of
the
pool
.
*NL*
He
came
round
it
and
leapt
upon
the
bank
beside
her
.
A
low
laugh
*NL*
escaped
her
--
the
third
utterance
which
the
girl
had
indulged
in
*NL*
tonight
.
The
first
,
when
she
stood
upon
Rainbarrow
,
had
expressed
*NL*
anxiety
;
the
second
,
on
the
ridge
,
had
expressed
impatience
;
the
*NL*
present
was
one
of
triumphant
pleasure
.
She
let
her
joyous
eyes
rest
*NL*
upon
him
without
speaking
,
as
upon
some
wondrous
thing
she
had
created
*NL*
out
of
chaos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
,
''
said
the
man
,
who
was
Wildeve
.
``
You
give
me
no
peace
.
*NL*
Why
do
you
not
leave
me
alone
?
I
have
seen
your
bonfire
all
the
*NL*
evening
.
''
The
words
were
not
without
emotion
,
and
retained
their
*NL*
level
tone
as
if
by
a
careful
equipoise
between
imminent
extremes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
unexpectedly
repressing
manner
in
her
lover
the
girl
seemed
to
*NL*
repress
herself
also
.
``
Of
course
you
have
seen
my
fire
,
''
she
answered
*NL*
with
languid
calmness
,
artificially
maintained
.
``
Why
should
n't
I
have
*NL*
a
bonfire
on
the
Fifth
of
November
,
like
other
denizens
of
the
heath
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
was
meant
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
know
it
?
I
have
had
no
word
with
you
since
you
--
you
*NL*
chose
her
,
and
walked
about
with
her
,
and
deserted
me
entirely
,
as
if
*NL*
I
had
never
been
yours
life
and
soul
so
irretrievably
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eustacia
!
could
I
forget
that
last
autumn
at
this
same
day
of
the
*NL*
month
and
at
this
same
place
you
lighted
exactly
such
a
fire
as
a
*NL*
signal
for
me
to
come
and
see
you
?
Why
should
there
have
been
a
*NL*
bonfire
again
by
Captain
Vye
's
house
if
not
for
the
same
purpose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
--
I
own
it
,
''
she
cried
under
her
breath
,
with
a
drowsy
*NL*
fervour
of
manner
and
tone
which
was
quite
peculiar
to
her
.
``
Do
n't
*NL*
begin
speaking
to
me
as
you
did
,
Damon
;
you
will
drive
me
to
say
words
*NL*
I
would
not
wish
to
say
to
you
.
I
had
given
you
up
,
and
resolved
not
*NL*
to
think
of
you
any
more
;
and
then
I
heard
the
news
,
and
I
came
out
*NL*
and
got
the
fire
ready
because
I
thought
that
you
had
been
faithful
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
heard
to
make
you
think
that
?
''
said
Wildeve
,
*NL*
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
did
not
marry
her
!
''
she
murmured
exultingly
.
``
And
I
knew
it
*NL*
was
because
you
loved
me
best

and
could
n't
do
it

Damon
,
you
have
*NL*
been
cruel
to
me
to
go
away
,
and
I
have
said
I
would
never
forgive
*NL*
you

I
do
not
think
I
can
forgive
you
entirely
,
even
now
--
it
is
too
*NL*
much
for
a
woman
of
any
spirit
to
quite
overlook

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
known
you
wished
to
call
me
up
here
only
to
reproach
me

I

would

have
come

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do

it

now

*NL*
``
Who
told

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

He
took
a
long
walk
today

as
he
was
coming
home
*NL*
he
overtook
some
person
who
told
him
of
a
broken-off
wedding

he
*NL*
thought

*NL*
``
Does

*NL*
*NL*
``

Now
Damon

do
you

why
I
lit
my

fire
?

did
not
think
I
would
have
lit
it
if
I
had
imagined
you
to
have
become
*NL*
the
husband
of
this
woman
.
It
is
insulting
my
pride
to
suppose
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
was
silent
;
it
was
evident
that
he
had
supposed
as
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
indeed
think
I
believed
you
were
married

she
again
demanded
*NL*
earnestly
.
``
Then
you
wronged
me

upon
my
life

heart
I
can

hardly
bear
to
recognize

such
ill
thoughts

me
!
Damon
,
*NL*
you
are
not
worthy

me

I
see
it

yet
I
love
you

Never
mind

let
it
go

I
must
bear
your
mean
opinion
as
best
I
may
...
It
is
true

*NL*
is
it
not

she
added
with
ill-concealed
anxiety
,
on
his
making
no
*NL*
demonstration
,
``
that
you
could
not
bring
yourself
to
give
me
up

are
still
going
to
love
me
best
of
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
or
why
should
I
have
come
?
''
he
said
touchily
.
``
Not
that
*NL*
fidelity
will
be
any
great
merit
in
me
after
your
kind
speech
*NL*
about
my
unworthiness

which
should
have
been
said
by
myself
if
by
*NL*
anybody
,
and
comes
with
an
ill
grace
from
you
.
However
,
the
curse
*NL*
of
inflammability
is
upon
me
,
and
I
must
live
under
it
,
and
take
*NL*
any
snub
from
a
woman

It
has
brought
me
down
from
engineering
to
*NL*
innkeeping
:
what
lower
stage
it
has
in
store
for
me
I
have
yet
to
*NL*
learn

''
He
continued
to
look
upon
her
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seized
the
moment
,
and
throwing
back
the
shawl
so
that
the
*NL*
firelight
shone
full
upon
her
face
and
throat
,
said
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
anything
better
than
that
in
your
travels

*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
was
not
one
to
commit
herself
to
such
a
position
without
good
*NL*
ground
.
He
said
quietly
,
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
even
on
the
shoulders
of
Thomasin

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

nothing
to

she
cried
with
quick
passionateness
.
*NL*
``
We
will
leave
her
out
;
there
are
only
you
and
me
now
to
think
of

*NL*
After
a
long
look
at
him
she
resumed
with
the
old
quiescent
warmth
:
*NL*
``
Must
I
go
on
weakly
confessing
to
you
things
a
woman
ought
to
*NL*
conceal
;
and
own
that
no
words
can
express
how
gloomy
I
have
been
*NL*
because
of
that
dreadful
belief
I
held
till
two
hours
ago

that
you

had
quite
deserted
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry

*NL*
``
But
perhaps
it
is
not
wholly
because

you

I
get
gloomy

she
*NL*
archly
added
.
``
It
is
in
my
nature

feel
like

*NL*
``
Hypochondriasis

yet
I
declare
that

here
tonight

one
good-bye

you
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
thank
you
for
that
,
''
she
said
,
turning
away
,
while
*NL*
indignation
spread
through
her
like
subterranean
heat
.
``
You
may
come
*NL*
again
to
Rainbarrow

you
like

you

I
shall
not
listen

and
you
may
tempt
me
,

I
wo
n't
give
*NL*
myself
to
you
any
more

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
said
as
much
before
,
sweet
;
but
such
natures
as
yours
do
n't
*NL*
so
easily
adhere
to
their
words
.
Neither
,
for
the
matter
of
that

do
*NL*
such
natures
as
mine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
pleasure
I
have
won
by
my
trouble
,
''
she
whispered
*NL*
bitterly
.
``
Why
did
I
try
to
recall
you
?
Damon
,
a
strange
warring
*NL*
takes
place
in
my
mind
occasionally

I
think
when
I
become
calm
after

your
woundings

`
Do
I
embrace
a

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
absently
towards
Rainbarrow
while
one
might
have
counted
*NL*
twenty
,
and
said
,
as
if
he
did
not
much
mind
all
this
,
``
Yes
,
I
will
go
*NL*
home
.
Do
you
mean
to
see
me
again
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
own
to
me
that
the

is
broken
off

you
love
me
*NL*
best

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
good
policy
,
''
said
Wildeve
,
smiling
.
``
You
*NL*
would
get
to
know
the
extent
of
your
power

clearly

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
she
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

I
prefer
not

her
;
I

come
in
obedience
to
your
call

That
is
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
merely
lit
that
fire
because
I
was
dull
,
and
thought
I
would
get
*NL*
a
little
excitement
by
calling
you
up
and
triumphing
over
you
as
the
*NL*
Witch
of
Endor
called
up
Samuel

I
determined
you
should
come
;

you

come

have
shown
my
power

A
mile
and
half
hither
,
and
a
mile
*NL*
and
half
back
again
to
your
home

three
miles
in
the
dark
for
me
.
*NL*
Have
I
not
shown
my
power

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
at
her
.
``
I
know
you
too
well
,
my
Eustacia
;
I
know
*NL*
you
too
well

There
is
n't
a
note
in
you
which
I
do

and
that
*NL*
hot
little
bosom
could
n't
play
such
a
coldblooded
trick
to
save
its
*NL*
life
.
I
saw
a
woman
on
Rainbarrow
at
dusk
looking
down
towards
my
*NL*
house
.
I
think
I
drew
out
you
before
you
drew
out
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
revived
embers
of
an
old
passion
glowed
clearly
in
Wildeve
now
;
*NL*
and
he
leant
forward
as
if
about
to
put
his
face
towards
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
''
she
said
,
intractably
moving
to
the
other
side
of
the
decayed
*NL*
fire
.
``
What
did
you
mean
by
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
may
kiss
your
hand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
may
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
may
shake
your
hand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
wish
you
good
night
without
caring
for
either
.
Good-bye
,
*NL*
good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
no
answer
,
and
with
the
bow
of
a
dancing-master
he
*NL*
vanished
on
the
other
side
of
the
pool
as
he
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
sighed
:
it
was
no
fragile
maiden
sigh
,
but
a
sigh
which
*NL*
shook
her
like
a
shiver
.
Whenever
a
flash
of
reason
darted
like
an
*NL*
electric
light
upon
her
lover
--
as
it
sometimes
would
--
and
showed
his
*NL*
imperfections
,
she
shivered
thus
.
But
it
was
over
in
a
second
,
and
*NL*
she
loved
on
.
She
knew
that
he
trifled
with
her
;
but
she
loved
on
.
*NL*
She
scattered
the
half-burnt
brands
,
went
indoors
immediately
,
and
up
*NL*
to
her
bedroom
without
a
light
.
Amid
the
rustles
which
denoted
her
to
*NL*
be
undressing
in
the
darkness
other
heavy
breaths
frequently
came
;
and
*NL*
the
same
kind
of
shudder
occasionally
moved
through
her
when
,
ten
*NL*
minutes
later
,
she
lay
on
her
bed
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Queen
of
Night
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
Vye
was
the
raw
material
of
a
divinity
.
On
Olympus
she
would
*NL*
have
done
well
with
a
little
preparation
.
She
had
the
passions
and
*NL*
instincts
which
make
a
model
goddess
,
that
is
,
those
which
make
not
*NL*
quite
a
model
woman
.
Had
it
been
possible
for
the
earth
and
mankind
*NL*
to
be
entirely
in
her
grasp
for
a
while
,
had
she
handled
the
distaff
,
*NL*
the
spindle
,
and
the
shears
at
her
own
free
will
,
few
in
the
world
*NL*
would
have
noticed
the
change
of
government
.
There
would
have
been
*NL*
the
same
inequality
of
lot
,
the
same
heaping
up
of
favours
here
,
*NL*
of
contumely
there
,
the
same
generosity
before
justice
,
the
same
*NL*
perpetual
dilemmas
,
the
same
captious
alteration
of
caresses
and
blows
*NL*
that
we
endure
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
person
full-limbed
and
somewhat
heavy
;
without
ruddiness
,
*NL*
as
without
pallor
;
and
soft
to
the
touch
as
a
cloud
.
To
see
her
hair
*NL*
was
to
fancy
that
a
whole
winter
did
not
contain
darkness
enough
*NL*
to
form
its
shadow
:
it
closed
over
her
forehead
like
nightfall
*NL*
extinguishing
the
western
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
nerves
extended
into
those
tresses
,
and
her
temper
could
always
*NL*
be
softened
by
stroking
them
down
.
When
her
hair
was
brushed
she
*NL*
would
instantly
sink
into
stillness
and
look
like
the
Sphinx
.
If
,
in
*NL*
passing
under
one
of
the
Egdon
banks
,
any
of
its
thick
skeins
were
*NL*
caught
,
as
they
sometimes
were
,
by
a
prickly
tuft
of
the
large
_
Ulex
*NL*
Europaeus
_
--
which
will
act
as
a
sort
of
hairbrush
--
she
would
go
back
*NL*
a
few
steps
,
and
pass
against
it
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
pagan
eyes
,
full
of
nocturnal
mysteries
,
and
their
light
,
as
*NL*
it
came
and
went
,
and
came
again
,
was
partially
hampered
by
their
*NL*
oppressive
lids
and
lashes
;
and
of
these
the
under
lid
was
much
fuller
*NL*
than
it
usually
is
with
English
women
.
This
enabled
her
to
indulge
in
*NL*
reverie
without
seeming
to
do
so
:
she
might
have
been
believed
capable
*NL*
of
sleeping
without
closing
them
up
.
Assuming
that
the
souls
of
*NL*
men
and
women
were
visible
essences
,
you
could
fancy
the
colour
of
*NL*
Eustacia
's
soul
to
be
flame-like
.
The
sparks
from
it
that
rose
into
*NL*
her
dark
pupils
gave
the
same
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mouth
seemed
formed
less
to
speak
than
to
quiver
,
less
to
quiver
*NL*
than
to
kiss
.
Some
might
have
added
,
less
to
kiss
than
to
curl
.
*NL*
Viewed
sideways
,
the
closing-line
of
her
lips
formed
,
with
almost
*NL*
geometric
precision
,
the
curve
so
well
known
in
the
arts
of
design
as
*NL*
the
cima-recta
,
or
ogee
.
The
sight
of
such
a
flexible
bend
as
that
*NL*
on
grim
Egdon
was
quite
an
apparition
.
It
was
felt
at
once
that
the
*NL*
mouth
did
not
come
over
from
Sleswig
with
a
band
of
Saxon
pirates
*NL*
whose
lips
met
like
the
two
halves
of
a
muffin
.
One
had
fancied
that
*NL*
such
lip-curves
were
mostly
lurking
underground
in
the
South
as
*NL*
fragments
of
forgotten
marbles
.
So
fine
were
the
lines
of
her
lips
*NL*
that
,
though
full
,
each
corner
of
her
mouth
was
as
clearly
cut
as
the
*NL*
point
of
a
spear
.
This
keenness
of
corner
was
only
blunted
when
she
*NL*
was
given
over
to
sudden
fits
of
gloom
,
one
of
the
phases
of
the
*NL*
night-side
of
sentiment
which
she
knew
too
well
for
her
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
presence
brought
memories
of
such
things
as
Bourbon
roses
,
rubies
,
*NL*
and
tropical
midnights
;
her
moods
recalled
lotus-eaters
and
the
march
*NL*
in
``
Athalie
''
;
her
motions
,
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
sea
;
her
voice
,
the
*NL*
viola
.
In
a
dim
light
,
and
with
a
slight
rearrangement
of
her
hair
,
*NL*
her
general
figure
might
have
stood
for
that
of
either
of
the
higher
*NL*
female
deities
.
The
new
moon
behind
her
head
,
an
old
helmet
upon
*NL*
it
,
a
diadem
of
accidental
dewdrops
round
her
brow
,
would
have
been
*NL*
adjuncts
sufficient
to
strike
the
note
of
Artemis
,
Athena
,
or
Hera
*NL*
respectively
,
with
as
close
an
approximation
to
the
antique
as
that
*NL*
which
passes
muster
on
many
respected
canvases
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
celestial
imperiousness
,
love
,
wrath
,
and
fervour
had
proved
to
be
*NL*
somewhat
thrown
away
on
netherward
Egdon
.
Her
power
was
limited
,
and
*NL*
the
consciousness
of
this
limitation
had
biassed
her
development
.
*NL*
Egdon
was
her
Hades
,
and
since
coming
there
she
had
imbibed
much
of
*NL*
what
was
dark
in
its
tone
,
though
inwardly
and
eternally
unreconciled
*NL*
thereto
.
Her
appearance
accorded
well
with
this
smouldering
*NL*
rebelliousness
,
and
the
shady
splendour
of
her
beauty
was
the
real
*NL*
surface
of
the
sad
and
stifled
warmth
within
her
.
A
true
Tartarean
*NL*
dignity
sat
upon
her
brow
,
and
not
factitiously
or
with
marks
of
*NL*
constraint
,
for
it
had
grown
in
her
with
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Across
the
upper
part
of
her
head
she
wore
a
thin
fillet
of
black
*NL*
velvet
,
restraining
the
luxuriance
of
her
shady
hair
,
in
a
way
which
*NL*
added
much
to
this
class
of
majesty
by
irregularly
clouding
her
*NL*
forehead
.
``
Nothing
can
embellish
a
beautiful
face
more
than
a
narrow
*NL*
band
drawn
over
the
brow
,
''
says
Richter
.
Some
of
the
neighbouring
*NL*
girls
wore
coloured
ribbon
for
the
same
purpose
,
and
sported
metallic
*NL*
ornaments
elsewhere
;
but
if
anyone
suggested
coloured
ribbon
and
*NL*
metallic
ornaments
to
Eustacia
Vye
she
laughed
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
a
woman
of
this
sort
live
on
Egdon
Heath
?
Budmouth
was
her
*NL*
native
place
,
a
fashionable
seaside
resort
at
that
date
.
She
was
the
*NL*
daughter
of
the
bandmaster
of
a
regiment
which
had
been
quartered
*NL*
there
--
a
Corfiote
by
birth
,
and
a
fine
musician
--
who
met
his
future
*NL*
wife
during
her
trip
thither
with
her
father
the
captain
,
a
man
of
*NL*
good
family
.
The
marriage
was
scarcely
in
accord
with
the
old
man
's
*NL*
wishes
,
for
the
bandmaster
's
pockets
were
as
light
as
his
occupation
.
*NL*
But
the
musician
did
his
best
;
adopted
his
wife
's
name
,
made
England
*NL*
permanently
his
home
,
took
great
trouble
with
his
child
's
education
,
*NL*
the
expenses
of
which
were
defrayed
by
the
grandfather
,
and
throve
as
*NL*
the
chief
local
musician
till
her
mother
's
death
,
when
he
left
off
*NL*
thriving
,
drank
,
and
died
also
.
The
girl
was
left
to
the
care
of
*NL*
her
grandfather
,
who
,
since
three
of
his
ribs
became
broken
in
a
*NL*
shipwreck
,
had
lived
in
this
airy
perch
on
Egdon
,
a
spot
which
had
*NL*
taken
his
fancy
because
the
house
was
to
be
had
for
next
to
nothing
,
*NL*
and
because
a
remote
blue
tinge
on
the
horizon
between
the
hills
,
*NL*
visible
from
the
cottage
door
,
was
traditionally
believed
to
be
the
*NL*
English
Channel
.
She
hated
the
change
;
she
felt
like
one
banished
;
*NL*
but
here
she
was
forced
to
abide
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
happened
that
in
Eustacia
's
brain
were
juxtaposed
the
*NL*
strangest
assortment
of
ideas
,
from
old
time
and
from
new
.
There
was
*NL*
no
middle
distance
in
her
perspective
:
romantic
recollections
of
*NL*
sunny
afternoons
on
an
esplanade
,
with
military
bands
,
officers
,
and
*NL*
gallants
around
,
stood
like
gilded
letters
upon
the
dark
tablet
of
*NL*
surrounding
Egdon
.
Every
bizarre
effect
that
could
result
from
the
*NL*
random
intertwining
of
watering-place
glitter
with
the
grand
solemnity
*NL*
of
a
heath
,
was
to
be
found
in
her
.
Seeing
nothing
of
human
life
now
,
*NL*
she
imagined
all
the
more
of
what
she
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
did
her
dignity
come
from
?
By
a
latent
vein
from
Alcinous
'
*NL*
line
,
her
father
hailing
from
Phaeacia
's
isle
?
--
or
from
Fitzalan
and
*NL*
De
Vere
,
her
maternal
grandfather
having
had
a
cousin
in
the
peerage
?
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
the
gift
of
Heaven
--
a
happy
convergence
of
natural
*NL*
laws
.
Among
other
things
opportunity
had
of
late
years
been
denied
*NL*
her
of
learning
to
be
undignified
,
for
she
lived
lonely
.
Isolation
on
*NL*
a
heath
renders
vulgarity
well-nigh
impossible
.
It
would
have
been
as
*NL*
easy
for
the
heath-ponies
,
bats
,
and
snakes
to
be
vulgar
as
for
her
.
*NL*
A
narrow
life
in
Budmouth
might
have
completely
demeaned
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
way
to
look
queenly
without
realms
or
hearts
to
queen
it
*NL*
over
is
to
look
as
if
you
had
lost
them
;
and
Eustacia
did
that
to
a
*NL*
triumph
.
In
the
captain
's
cottage
she
could
suggest
mansions
she
had
*NL*
never
seen
.
Perhaps
that
was
because
she
frequented
a
vaster
mansion
*NL*
than
any
of
them
,
the
open
hills
.
Like
the
summer
condition
of
the
*NL*
place
around
her
,
she
was
an
embodiment
of
the
phrase
``
a
populous
*NL*
solitude
''
--
apparently
so
listless
,
void
,
and
quiet
,
she
was
really
*NL*
busy
and
full
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
loved
to
madness
--
such
was
her
great
desire
.
Love
was
to
her
the
*NL*
one
cordial
which
could
drive
away
the
eating
loneliness
of
her
days
.
*NL*
And
she
seemed
to
long
for
the
abstraction
called
passionate
love
more
*NL*
than
for
any
particular
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
show
a
most
reproachful
look
at
times
,
but
it
was
directed
*NL*
less
against
human
beings
than
against
certain
creatures
of
her
mind
,
*NL*
the
chief
of
these
being
Destiny
,
through
whose
interference
she
*NL*
dimly
fancied
it
arose
that
love
alighted
only
on
gliding
youth
--
that
*NL*
any
love
she
might
win
would
sink
simultaneously
with
the
sand
in
*NL*
the
glass
.
She
thought
of
it
with
an
ever-growing
consciousness
of
*NL*
cruelty
,
which
tended
to
breed
actions
of
reckless
unconventionality
,
*NL*
framed
to
snatch
a
year
's
,
a
week
's
,
even
an
hour
's
passion
from
*NL*
anywhere
while
it
could
be
won
.
Through
want
of
it
she
had
sung
*NL*
without
being
merry
,
possessed
without
enjoying
,
outshone
without
*NL*
triumphing
.
Her
loneliness
deepened
her
desire
.
On
Egdon
,
coldest
*NL*
and
meanest
kisses
were
at
famine
prices
;
and
where
was
a
mouth
*NL*
matching
hers
to
be
found
?
*NL*
*NL*
Fidelity
in
love
for
fidelity
's
sake
had
less
attraction
for
her
than
*NL*
for
most
women
:
fidelity
because
of
love
's
grip
had
much
.
A
blaze
of
*NL*
love
,
and
extinction
,
was
better
than
a
lantern
glimmer
of
the
same
*NL*
which
should
last
long
years
.
On
this
head
she
knew
by
prevision
what
*NL*
most
women
learn
only
by
experience
:
she
had
mentally
walked
round
*NL*
love
,
told
the
towers
thereof
,
considered
its
palaces
,
and
concluded
*NL*
that
love
was
but
a
doleful
joy
.
Yet
she
desired
it
,
as
one
in
a
*NL*
desert
would
be
thankful
for
brackish
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
often
repeated
her
prayers
;
not
at
particular
times
,
but
,
like
the
*NL*
unaffectedly
devout
,
when
she
desired
to
pray
.
Her
prayer
was
always
*NL*
spontaneous
,
and
often
ran
thus
,
``
O
deliver
my
heart
from
this
fearful
*NL*
gloom
and
loneliness
;
send
me
great
love
from
somewhere
,
else
I
shall
*NL*
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
high
gods
were
William
the
Conqueror
,
Strafford
,
and
Napoleon
*NL*
Buonaparte
,
as
they
had
appeared
in
the
Lady
's
History
used
at
the
*NL*
establishment
in
which
she
was
educated
.
Had
she
been
a
mother
she
*NL*
would
have
christened
her
boys
such
names
as
Saul
or
Sisera
in
*NL*
preference
to
Jacob
or
David
,
neither
of
whom
she
admired
.
At
school
*NL*
she
had
used
to
side
with
the
Philistines
in
several
battles
,
and
had
*NL*
wondered
if
Pontius
Pilate
were
as
handsome
as
he
was
frank
and
fair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
she
was
a
girl
of
some
forwardness
of
mind
,
indeed
,
weighed
in
*NL*
relation
to
her
situation
among
the
very
rearward
of
thinkers
,
very
*NL*
original
.
Her
instincts
towards
social
non-comformity
were
at
the
*NL*
root
of
this
.
In
the
matter
of
holidays
,
her
mood
was
that
of
horses
*NL*
who
,
when
turned
out
to
grass
,
enjoy
looking
upon
their
kind
at
work
*NL*
on
the
highway
.
She
only
valued
rest
to
herself
when
it
came
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
other
people
's
labour
.
Hence
she
hated
Sundays
when
all
was
*NL*
at
rest
,
and
often
said
they
would
be
the
death
of
her
.
To
see
the
*NL*
heathmen
in
their
Sunday
condition
,
that
is
,
with
their
hands
in
their
*NL*
pockets
,
their
boots
newly
oiled
,
and
not
laced
up
-LRB-
a
particularly
*NL*
Sunday
sign
-RRB-
,
walking
leisurely
among
the
turves
and
furze-faggots
*NL*
they
had
cut
during
the
week
,
and
kicking
them
critically
as
if
*NL*
their
use
were
unknown
,
was
a
fearful
heaviness
to
her
.
To
relieve
*NL*
the
tedium
of
this
untimely
day
she
would
overhaul
the
cupboards
*NL*
containing
her
grandfather
's
old
charts
and
other
rubbish
,
humming
*NL*
Saturday-night
ballads
of
the
country
people
the
while
.
But
on
*NL*
Saturday
nights
she
would
frequently
sing
a
psalm
,
and
it
was
always
*NL*
on
a
week-day
that
she
read
the
Bible
,
that
she
might
be
unoppressed
*NL*
with
a
sense
of
doing
her
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
views
of
life
were
to
some
extent
the
natural
begettings
of
her
*NL*
situation
upon
her
nature
.
To
dwell
on
a
heath
without
studying
its
*NL*
meanings
was
like
wedding
a
foreigner
without
learning
his
tongue
.
*NL*
The
subtle
beauties
of
the
heath
were
lost
to
Eustacia
;
she
only
*NL*
caught
its
vapours
.
An
environment
which
would
have
made
a
contented
*NL*
woman
a
poet
,
a
suffering
woman
a
devotee
,
a
pious
woman
a
psalmist
,
*NL*
even
a
giddy
woman
thoughtful
,
made
a
rebellious
woman
saturnine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
had
got
beyond
the
vision
of
some
marriage
of
inexpressible
*NL*
glory
;
yet
,
though
her
emotions
were
in
full
vigour
,
she
cared
for
*NL*
no
meaner
union
.
Thus
we
see
her
in
a
strange
state
of
isolation
.
To
*NL*
have
lost
the
godlike
conceit
that
we
may
do
what
we
will
,
and
not
to
*NL*
have
acquired
a
homely
zest
for
doing
what
we
can
,
shows
a
grandeur
*NL*
of
temper
which
can
not
be
objected
to
in
the
abstract
,
for
it
*NL*
denotes
a
mind
that
,
though
disappointed
,
forswears
compromise
.
*NL*
But
,
if
congenial
to
philosophy
,
it
is
apt
to
be
dangerous
to
*NL*
the
commonwealth
.
In
a
world
where
doing
means
marrying
,
and
the
*NL*
commonwealth
is
one
of
hearts
and
hands
,
the
same
peril
attends
the
*NL*
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
we
see
our
Eustacia
--
for
at
times
she
was
not
altogether
*NL*
unlovable
--
arriving
at
that
stage
of
enlightenment
which
feels
*NL*
that
nothing
is
worth
while
,
and
filling
up
the
spare
hours
of
her
*NL*
existence
by
idealizing
Wildeve
for
want
of
a
better
object
.
This
was
*NL*
the
sole
reason
of
his
ascendency
:
she
knew
it
herself
.
At
moments
*NL*
her
pride
rebelled
against
her
passion
for
him
,
and
she
even
had
*NL*
longed
to
be
free
.
But
there
was
only
one
circumstance
which
could
*NL*
dislodge
him
,
and
that
was
the
advent
of
a
greater
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
rest
,
she
suffered
much
from
depression
of
spirits
,
and
took
*NL*
slow
walks
to
recover
them
,
in
which
she
carried
her
grandfather
's
*NL*
telescope
and
her
grandmother
's
hourglass
--
the
latter
because
of
a
*NL*
peculiar
pleasure
she
derived
from
watching
a
material
representation
*NL*
of
time
's
gradual
glide
away
.
She
seldom
schemed
,
but
when
she
did
*NL*
scheme
,
her
plans
showed
rather
the
comprehensive
strategy
of
a
*NL*
general
than
the
small
arts
called
womanish
,
though
she
could
utter
*NL*
oracles
of
Delphian
ambiguity
when
she
did
not
choose
to
be
direct
.
*NL*
In
heaven
she
will
probably
sit
between
the
Heloises
and
the
*NL*
Cleopatras
.

Those
Who
Are
Found
Where
There
Is
Said
to
Be
Nobody
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
sad
little
boy
had
withdrawn
from
the
fire
he
clasped
*NL*
the
money
tight
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
as
if
thereby
to
fortify
his
*NL*
courage
,
and
began
to
run
.
There
was
really
little
danger
in
allowing
*NL*
a
child
to
go
home
alone
on
this
part
of
Egdon
Heath
.
The
distance
*NL*
to
the
boy
's
house
was
not
more
than
three-eighths
of
a
mile
,
his
*NL*
father
's
cottage
,
and
one
other
a
few
yards
further
on
,
forming
part
*NL*
of
the
small
hamlet
of
Mistover
Knap
:
the
third
and
only
remaining
*NL*
house
was
that
of
Captain
Vye
and
Eustacia
,
which
stood
quite
away
*NL*
from
the
small
cottages
,
and
was
the
loneliest
of
lonely
houses
on
*NL*
these
thinly
populated
slopes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
until
he
was
out
of
breath
,
and
then
,
becoming
more
courageous
,
*NL*
walked
leisurely
along
,
singing
in
an
old
voice
a
little
song
about
a
*NL*
sailor-boy
and
a
fair
one
,
and
bright
gold
in
store
.
In
the
middle
of
*NL*
this
the
child
stopped
:
from
a
pit
under
the
hill
ahead
of
him
shone
a
*NL*
light
,
whence
proceeded
a
cloud
of
floating
dust
and
a
smacking
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
unusual
sights
and
sounds
frightened
the
boy
.
The
shrivelled
*NL*
voice
of
the
heath
did
not
alarm
him
,
for
that
was
familiar
.
The
*NL*
thorn-bushes
which
arose
in
his
path
from
time
to
time
were
less
*NL*
satisfactory
,
for
they
whistled
gloomily
,
and
had
a
ghastly
habit
*NL*
after
dark
of
putting
on
the
shapes
of
jumping
madmen
,
sprawling
*NL*
giants
,
and
hideous
cripples
.
Lights
were
not
uncommon
this
evening
,
*NL*
but
the
nature
of
all
of
them
was
different
from
this
.
Discretion
*NL*
rather
than
terror
prompted
the
boy
to
turn
back
instead
of
passing
*NL*
the
light
,
with
a
view
of
asking
Miss
Eustacia
Vye
to
let
her
servant
*NL*
accompany
him
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
boy
had
reascended
to
the
top
of
the
valley
he
found
the
fire
*NL*
to
be
still
burning
on
the
bank
,
though
lower
than
before
.
Beside
it
,
*NL*
instead
of
Eustacia
's
solitary
form
,
he
saw
two
persons
,
the
second
*NL*
being
a
man
.
The
boy
crept
along
under
the
bank
to
ascertain
from
*NL*
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
if
it
would
be
prudent
to
interrupt
so
*NL*
splendid
a
creature
as
Miss
Eustacia
on
his
poor
trivial
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
listening
under
the
bank
for
some
minutes
to
the
talk
he
turned
*NL*
in
a
perplexed
and
doubting
manner
and
began
to
withdraw
as
silently
*NL*
as
he
had
come
.
That
he
did
not
,
upon
the
whole
,
think
it
advisable
*NL*
to
interrupt
her
conversation
with
Wildeve
,
without
being
prepared
to
*NL*
bear
the
whole
weight
of
her
displeasure
,
was
obvious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
Scyllaeo-Charybdean
position
for
a
poor
boy
.
Pausing
*NL*
when
again
safe
from
discovery
,
he
finally
decided
to
face
the
pit
*NL*
phenomenon
as
the
lesser
evil
.
With
a
heavy
sigh
he
retraced
the
*NL*
slope
,
and
followed
the
path
he
had
followed
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
had
gone
,
the
rising
dust
had
disappeared
--
he
hoped
for
*NL*
ever
.
He
marched
resolutely
along
,
and
found
nothing
to
alarm
him
*NL*
till
,
coming
within
a
few
yards
of
the
sandpit
,
he
heard
a
slight
*NL*
noise
in
front
,
which
led
him
to
halt
.
The
halt
was
but
momentary
,
*NL*
for
the
noise
resolved
itself
into
the
steady
bites
of
two
animals
*NL*
grazing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
he
`
th-croppers
down
here
,
''
he
said
aloud
.
``
I
have
never
known
*NL*
'em
come
down
so
far
afore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
animals
were
in
the
direct
line
of
his
path
,
but
that
the
child
*NL*
thought
little
of
;
he
had
played
round
the
fetlocks
of
horses
from
his
*NL*
infancy
.
On
coming
nearer
,
however
,
the
boy
was
somewhat
surprised
to
*NL*
find
that
the
little
creatures
did
not
run
off
,
and
that
each
wore
a
*NL*
clog
,
to
prevent
his
going
astray
;
this
signified
that
they
had
been
*NL*
broken
in
.
He
could
now
see
the
interior
of
the
pit
,
which
,
being
in
*NL*
the
side
of
the
hill
,
had
a
level
entrance
.
In
the
innermost
corner
*NL*
the
square
outline
of
a
van
appeared
,
with
its
back
towards
him
.
A
*NL*
light
came
from
the
interior
,
and
threw
a
moving
shadow
upon
the
*NL*
vertical
face
of
gravel
at
the
further
side
of
the
pit
into
which
the
*NL*
vehicle
faced
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
assumed
that
this
was
the
cart
of
a
gipsy
,
and
his
dread
*NL*
of
those
wanderers
reached
but
to
that
mild
pitch
which
titillates
*NL*
rather
than
pains
.
Only
a
few
inches
of
mud
wall
kept
him
and
his
*NL*
family
from
being
gipsies
themselves
.
He
skirted
the
gravel-pit
at
*NL*
a
respectful
distance
,
ascended
the
slope
,
and
came
forward
upon
*NL*
the
brow
,
in
order
to
look
into
the
open
door
of
the
van
and
see
the
*NL*
original
of
the
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
picture
alarmed
the
boy
.
By
a
little
stove
inside
the
van
sat
*NL*
a
figure
red
from
head
to
heels
--
the
man
who
had
been
Thomasin
's
*NL*
friend
.
He
was
darning
a
stocking
,
which
was
red
like
the
rest
of
him
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
as
he
darned
he
smoked
a
pipe
,
the
stem
and
bowl
of
which
*NL*
were
red
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
one
of
the
heath-croppers
feeding
in
the
outer
shadows
*NL*
was
audibly
shaking
off
the
clog
attached
to
its
foot
.
Aroused
by
the
*NL*
sound
the
reddleman
laid
down
his
stocking
,
lit
a
lantern
which
hung
*NL*
beside
him
,
and
came
out
from
the
van
.
In
sticking
up
the
candle
he
*NL*
lifted
the
lantern
to
his
face
,
and
the
light
shone
into
the
whites
*NL*
of
his
eyes
and
upon
his
ivory
teeth
,
which
,
in
contrast
with
the
*NL*
red
surrounding
,
lent
him
a
startling
aspect
enough
to
the
gaze
of
a
*NL*
juvenile
.
The
boy
knew
too
well
for
his
peace
of
mind
upon
whose
lair
*NL*
he
had
lighted
.
Uglier
persons
than
gipsies
were
known
to
cross
Egdon
*NL*
at
times
,
and
a
reddleman
was
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
wish
't
was
only
a
gipsy
!
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
was
by
this
time
coming
back
from
the
horses
.
In
his
fear
of
*NL*
being
seen
the
boy
rendered
detection
certain
by
nervous
motion
.
The
*NL*
heather
and
peat
stratum
overhung
the

of
the
pit
in

,
hiding
*NL*
the
actual
verge
.
The
boy
had
stepped
beyond
the
solid
ground
;
the
*NL*
heather
now
gave
way
,
and
down
he
rolled
over
the
scarp
of
grey
sand
*NL*
to
the
very
foot
of
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
red
man
opened
the
lantern
and
turned
it
upon
the
figure
of
the
*NL*
prostrate
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
be
ye
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Johnny
Nunsuch

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
doing
up
there

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Watching
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
watch
me
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

was
coming
home
from
Miss
Vye
's
bonfire

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beest
hurt

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
you
be
:
your
hand
is
bleeding

Come
under
my
tilt
and
let
*NL*
me
tie
it
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
let
me
look
for
my
sixpence

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
come
by
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Vye
gied
it
to
me
for
keeping
up
her
bonfire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sixpence
was
found
,
and
the
man
went
to
the
van
,
the
boy
behind
,
*NL*
almost
holding
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
took
a
piece
of
rag
from
a
satchel
containing
sewing
*NL*
materials
,
tore
off
a
strip
,
which
,
like
everything
else
,
was
tinged
*NL*
red
,
and
proceeded
to
bind
up
the
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
eyes
have
got
foggy-like
--
please
may
I
sit
down
,
master
?
''
said
the
*NL*
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
poor
chap
.
'T
is
enough
to
make
you
feel
fainty
.
Sit
on
*NL*
that
bundle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
finished
tying
up
the
gash
,
and
the
boy
said
,
``
I
think
I
'll
go
*NL*
home
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
rather
afraid
of
me
.
Do
you
know
what
I
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
surveyed
his
vermilion
figure
up
and
down
with
much
*NL*
misgiving
and
finally
said
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
reddleman

he
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

's
what
I

*NL*

The

suddenly
ceased

talk
idly

he
inquired

*NL*
``

``

the

slapping
his

against

his

so
that

shook
under

jumped
clean
from

*NL*

said
the

suddenly

He
conducted
the
boy
out
of
the
gravel-pit
and
into
the
path
leading
*NL*
to
his
mother
's
cottage

When
the
little
figure
had
vanished
in
the

darkness
the

returned

resumed
his

proceeded
to

again

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Reddlemen
of
the
old
school
are
now
but
seldom
seen
.
Since
the
*NL*
introduction
of
railways
Wessex
farmers
have
managed
to
do
without
*NL*
these
Mephistophelian
visitants
,
and
the
bright
pigment
so
largely
*NL*
used
by
shepherds
in
preparing
sheep
for
the
fair
is
obtained
by
other
*NL*
routes
.
Even
those
who
yet
survive
are
losing
the
poetry
of
existence
*NL*
which
characterized
them
when
the
pursuit
of
the
trade
meant
*NL*
periodical
journeys
to
the
pit
whence
the
material
was
dug
,
a
regular
*NL*
camping
out
from
month
to
month
,
except
in
the
depth
of
winter
,
a
*NL*
peregrination
among
farms
which
could
be
counted
by
the
hundred
,
*NL*
and
in
spite
of
this
Arab
existence
the
preservation
of
that
*NL*
respectability
which
is
insured
by
the
never-failing
production
of
a
*NL*
well-lined
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reddle
spreads
its
lively
hues
over
everything
it
lights
on
,
and
*NL*
stamps
unmistakably
,
as
with
the
mark
of
Cain
,
any
person
who
has
*NL*
handled
it
half
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
child
's
first
sight
of
a
reddleman
was
an
epoch
in
his
life
.
That
*NL*
blood-coloured
figure
was
a
sublimation
of
all
the
horrid
dreams
*NL*
which
had
afflicted
the
juvenile
spirit
since
imagination
began
.
``
The
*NL*
reddleman
is
coming
for
you
!
''
had
been
the
formulated
threat
of
Wessex
*NL*
mothers
for
many
generations
.
He
was
successfully
supplanted
for
a
*NL*
while
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
,
by
Buonaparte
;
but
as
*NL*
process
of
time
rendered
the
latter
personage
stale
and
ineffective
*NL*
the
older
phrase
resumed
its
early
prominence
.
And
now
the
reddleman
*NL*
has
in
his
turn
followed
Buonaparte
to
the
land
of
worn-out
bogeys
,
*NL*
and
his
place
is
filled
by
modern
inventions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
lived
like
a
gipsy
;
but
gipsies
he
scorned
.
He
was
*NL*
about
as
thriving
as
travelling
basket
and
mat
makers
;
but
he
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
them
.
He
was
more
decently
born
and
brought
up
*NL*
than
the
cattle-drovers
who
passed
and
repassed
him
in
his
wanderings
;
*NL*
but
they
merely
nodded
to
him
.
His
stock
was
more
valuable
than
that
*NL*
of
pedlars
;
but
they
did
not
think
so
,
and
passed
his
cart
with
eyes
*NL*
straight
ahead
.
He
was
such
an
unnatural
colour
to
look
at
that
the
*NL*
men
of
round-abouts
and
wax-work
shows
seemed
gentlemen
beside
him
;
*NL*
but
he
considered
them
low
company
,
and
remained
aloof
.
Among
all
*NL*
these
squatters
and
folks
of
the
road
the
reddleman
continually
found
*NL*
himself
;
yet
he
was
not
of
them
.
His
occupation
tended
to
isolate
*NL*
him
,
and
isolated
he
was
mostly
seen
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
sometimes
suggested
that
reddlemen
were
criminals
for
whose
*NL*
misdeeds
other
men
had
wrongfully
suffered
:
that
in
escaping
the
law
*NL*
they
had
not
escaped
their
own
consciences
,
and
had
taken
to
the
trade
*NL*
as
a
lifelong
penance
.
Else
why
should
they
have
chosen
it
?
In
the
*NL*
present
case
such
a
question
would
have
been
particularly
apposite
.
*NL*
The
reddleman
who
had
entered
Egdon
that
afternoon
was
an
instance
of
*NL*
the
pleasing
being
wasted
to
form
the
ground-work
of
the
singular
,
*NL*
when
an
ugly
foundation
would
have
done
just
as
well
for
that
purpose
.
*NL*
The
one
point
that
was
forbidding
about
this
reddleman
was
his
colour
.
*NL*
Freed
from
that
he
would
have
been
as
agreeable
a
specimen
of
rustic
*NL*
manhood
as
one
would
often
see
.
A
keen
observer
might
have
been
*NL*
inclined
to
think
--
which
was
,
indeed
,
partly
the
truth
--
that
he
had
*NL*
relinquished
his
proper
station
in
life
for
want
of
interest
in
it
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
after
looking
at
him
one
would
have
hazarded
the
guess
*NL*
that
good-nature
,
and
an
acuteness
as
extreme
as
it
could
be
without
*NL*
verging
on
craft
,
formed
the
frame-work
of
his
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
darned
the
stocking
his
face
became
rigid
with
thought
.
*NL*
Softer
expressions
followed
this
,
and
then
again
recurred
the
tender
*NL*
sadness
which
had
sat
upon
him
during
his
drive
along
the
highway
that
*NL*
afternoon
.
Presently
his
needle
stopped
.
He
laid
down
the
stocking
,
*NL*
arose
from
his
seat
,
and
took
a
leather
pouch
from
a
hook
in
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
van
.
This
contained
among
other
articles
a
brown-paper
*NL*
packet
,
which
,
to
judge
from
the
hinge-like
character
of
its
worn
*NL*
folds
,
seemed
to
have
been
carefully
opened
and
closed
a
good
many
*NL*
times
.
He
sat
down
on
a
three-legged
milking
stool
that
formed
the
*NL*
only
seat
in
the
van
,
and
,
examining
his
packet
by
the
light
of
a
*NL*
candle
,
took
thence
an
old
letter
and
spread
it
open
.
The
writing
had
*NL*
originally
been
traced
on
white
paper
,
but
the
letter
had
now
assumed
*NL*
a
pale
red
tinge
from
the
accident
of
its
situation
;
and
the
black
*NL*
strokes
of
writing
thereon
looked
like
the
twigs
of
a
winter
hedge
*NL*
against
a
vermilion
sunset
.
The
letter
bore
a
date
some
two
years
*NL*
previous
to
that
time
,
and
was
signed
``
Thomasin
Yeobright
.
''
It
ran
as
*NL*
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
DEAR
DIGGORY
VENN
,
--
The
question
you
put
when
you
overtook
*NL*
me
coming
home
from
Pond-close
gave
me
such
a
surprise
that
*NL*
I
am
afraid
I
did
not
make
you
exactly
understand
what
I
*NL*
meant
.
Of
course
,
if
my
aunt
had
not
met
me
I
could
have
*NL*
explained
all
then
at
once
,
but
as
it
was
there
was
no
*NL*
chance
.
I
have
been
quite
uneasy
since
,
as
you
know
I
do
*NL*
not
wish
to
pain
you
,
yet
I
fear
I
shall
be
doing
so
now
in
*NL*
contradicting
what
I
seemed
to
say
then
.
I
can
not
,
Diggory
,
*NL*
marry
you
,
or
think
of
letting
you
call
me
your
sweetheart
.
*NL*
I
could
not
,
indeed
,
Diggory
.
I
hope
you
will
not
much
mind
*NL*
my
saying
this
,
and
feel
in
a
great
pain
.
It
makes
me
very
*NL*
sad
when
I
think
it
may
,
for
I
like
you
very
much
,
and
I
*NL*
always
put
you
next
to
my
cousin
Clym
in
my
mind
.
There
are
*NL*
so
many
reasons
why
we
can
not
be
married
that
I
can
hardly
*NL*
name
them
all
in
a
letter
.
I
did
not
in
the
least
expect
*NL*
that
you
were
going
to
speak
on
such
a
thing
when
you
*NL*
followed
me
,
because
I
had
never
thought
of
you
in
the
*NL*
sense
of
a
lover
at
all
.
You
must
not
becall
me
for
laughing
*NL*
when
you
spoke
;
you
mistook
when
you
thought
I
laughed
at
*NL*
you
as
a
foolish
man
.
I
laughed
because
the
idea
was
so
odd
,
*NL*
and
not
at
you
at
all
.
The
great
reason
with
my
own
personal
*NL*
self
for
not
letting
you
court
me
is
,
that
I
do
not
feel
the
*NL*
things
a
woman
ought
to
feel
who
consents
to
walk
with
you
*NL*
with
the
meaning
of
being
your
wife
.
It
is
not
as
you
think
,
*NL*
that
I
have
another
in
my
mind
,
for
I
do
not
encourage
*NL*
anybody
,
and
never
have
in
my
life
.
Another
reason
is
my
*NL*
aunt
.
She
would
not
,
I
know
,
agree
to
it
,
even
if
I
wished
*NL*
to
have
you
.
She
likes
you
very
well
,
but
she
will
want
me
*NL*
to
look
a
little
higher
than
a
small
dairy-farmer
,
and
marry
*NL*
a
professional
man
.
I
hope
you
will
not
set
your
heart
*NL*
against
me
for
writing
plainly
,
but
I
felt
you
might
try
to
*NL*
see
me
again
,
and
it
is
better
that
we
should
not
meet
.
I
*NL*
shall
always
think
of
you
as
a
good
man
,
and
be
anxious
for
*NL*
your
well-doing
.
I
send
this
by
Jane
Orchard
's
little
maid
,
*NL*
--
And
remain
Diggory
,
your
faithful
friend

THOMASIN
YEOBRIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
To
MR.
VENN
,
Dairy-farmer
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
arrival
of
that
letter
,
on
a
certain
autumn
morning
long
*NL*
ago
,
the
reddleman
and
Thomasin
had
not
met
till
today
.
During
the
*NL*
interval
he
had
shifted
his
position
even
further
from
hers
than
it
*NL*
had
originally
been
,
by
adopting
the
reddle
trade
;
though
he
was
*NL*
really
in
very
good
circumstances
still
.
Indeed
,
seeing
that
his
*NL*
expenditure
was
only
one-fourth
of
his
income
,
he
might
have
been
*NL*
called
a
prosperous
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rejected
suitors
take
to
roaming
as
naturally
as
unhived
bees
;
and
*NL*
the
business
to
which
he
had
cynically
devoted
himself
was
in
many
*NL*
ways
congenial
to
Venn
.
But
his
wanderings
,
by
mere
stress
of
old
*NL*
emotions
,
had
frequently
taken
an
Egdon
direction
,
though
he
never
*NL*
intruded
upon
her
who
attracted
him
thither
.
To
be
in
Thomasin
's
*NL*
heath
,
and
near
her
,
yet
unseen
,
was
the
one
ewe-lamb
of
pleasure
*NL*
left
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
incident
of
that
day
,
and
the
reddleman
,
still
loving
*NL*
her
well
,
was
excited
by
this
accidental
service
to
her
at
a
critical
*NL*
juncture
to
vow
an
active
devotion
to
her
cause
,
instead
of
,
as
*NL*
hitherto
,
sighing
and
holding
aloof
.
After
what
had
happened
,
it
*NL*
was
impossible
that
he
should
not
doubt
the
honesty
of
Wildeve
's
*NL*
intentions
.
But
her
hope
was
apparently
centred
upon
him
;
and
*NL*
dismissing
his
regrets
Venn
determined
to
aid
her
to
be
happy
in
*NL*
her
own
chosen
way
.
That
this
way
was
,
of
all
others
,
the
most
*NL*
distressing
to
himself
,
was
awkward
enough
;
but
the
reddleman
's
love
*NL*
was
generous
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
active
step
in
watching
over
Thomasin
's
interests
was
taken
*NL*
about
seven
o'clock
the
next
evening
,
and
was
dictated
by
the
news
*NL*
which
he
had
learnt
from
the
sad
boy
.
That
Eustacia
was
somehow
the
*NL*
cause
of
Wildeve
's
carelessness
in
relation
to
the
marriage
had
at
*NL*
once
been
Venn
's
conclusion
on
hearing
of
the
secret
meeting
between
*NL*
them
.
It
did
not
occur
to
his
mind
that
Eustacia
's
love-signal
*NL*
to
Wildeve
was
the
tender
effect
upon
the
deserted
beauty
of
the
*NL*
intelligence
which
her
grandfather
had
brought
home
.
His
instinct
was
*NL*
to
regard
her
as
a
conspirator
against
rather
than
as
an
antecedent
*NL*
obstacle
to
Thomasin
's
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
day
he
had
been
exceedingly
anxious
to
learn
the
condition
*NL*
of
Thomasin
;
but
he
did
not
venture
to
intrude
upon
a
threshold
to
*NL*
which
he
was
a
stranger
,
particularly
at
such
an
unpleasant
moment
as
*NL*
this
.
He
had
occupied
his
time
in
moving
with
his
ponies
and
load
to
*NL*
a
new
point
in
the
heath
,
eastward
to
his
previous
station
;
and
here
*NL*
he
selected
a
nook
with
a
careful
eye
to
shelter
from
wind
and
rain
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
mean
that
his
stay
there
was
to
be
a
comparatively
*NL*
extended
one
.
After
this
he
returned
on
foot
some
part
of
the
way
*NL*
that
he
had
come
;
and
,
it
being
now
dark
,
he
diverged
to
the
left
till
*NL*
he
stood
behind
a
holly-bush
on
the
edge
of
a
pit
not
twenty
yards
*NL*
from
Rainbarrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
for
a
meeting
there
,
but
he
watched
in
vain
.
Nobody
except
*NL*
himself
came
near
the
spot
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
loss
of
his
labour
produced
little
effect
upon
the
reddleman
.
*NL*
He
had
stood
in
the
shoes
of
Tantalus
,
and
seemed
to
look
upon
*NL*
a
certain
mass
of
disappointment
as
the
natural
preface
to
all
*NL*
realizations
,
without
which
preface
they
would
give
cause
for
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
hour
the
next
evening
found
him
again
at
the
same
place
;
but
*NL*
Eustacia
and
Wildeve
,
the
expected
trysters
,
did
not
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pursued
precisely
the
same
course
yet
four
nights
longer
,
and
*NL*
without
success
.
But
on
the
next
,
being
the
day-week
of
their
*NL*
previous
meeting
,
he
saw
a
female
shape
floating
along
the
ridge
and
*NL*
the
outline
of
a
young
man
ascending
from
the
valley
.
They
met
in
the
*NL*
little
ditch
encircling
the
tumulus
--
the
original
excavation
from
*NL*
which
it
had
been
thrown
up
by
the
ancient
British
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
,
stung
with
suspicion
of
wrong
to
Thomasin
,
was
aroused
*NL*
to
strategy
in
a
moment
.
He
instantly
left
the
bush
and
crept
forward
*NL*
on
his
hands
and
knees
.
When
he
had
got
as
close
as
he
might
safely
*NL*
venture
without
discovery
he
found
that
,
owing
to
a
cross-wind
,
the
*NL*
conversation
of
the
trysting
pair
could
not
be
overheard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
him
,
as
in
divers
places
about
the
heath
,
were
areas
strewn
with
*NL*
large
turves
,
which
lay
edgeways
and
upside
down
awaiting
removal
by
*NL*
Timothy
Fairway
,
previous
to
the
winter
weather
.
He
took
two
of
these
*NL*
as
he
lay
,
and
dragged
them
over
him
till
one
covered
his
head
and
*NL*
shoulders
,
the
other
his
back
and
legs
.
The
reddleman
would
now
have
*NL*
been
quite
invisible
,
even
by
daylight
;
the
turves
,
standing
upon
him
*NL*
with
the
heather
upwards
,
looked
precisely
as
if
they
were
growing
.
*NL*
He
crept
along
again
,
and
the
turves
upon
his
back
crept
with
him
.
*NL*
Had
he
approached
without
any
covering
the
chances
are
that
he
would
*NL*
not
have
been
perceived
in
the
dusk
;
approaching
thus
,
it
was
as
*NL*
though
he
burrowed
underground
.
In
this
manner
he
came
quite
close
to
*NL*
where
the
two
were
standing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wish
to
consult
me
on
the
matter
?
''
reached
his
ears
in
the
rich
,
*NL*
impetuous
accents
of
Eustacia
Vye
.
``
Consult
me
?
It
is
an
indignity
*NL*
to
me
to
talk
so
:
I
wo
n't
bear
it
any
longer
!
''
She
began
weeping
.
*NL*
``
I
have
loved
you
,
and
have
shown
you
that
I
loved
you
,
much
to
my
*NL*
regret
;
and
yet
you
can
come
and
say
in
that
frigid
way
that
you
wish
*NL*
to
consult
with
me
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
marry
Thomasin
.
*NL*
Better
--
of
course
it
would
be
.
Marry
her
:
she
is
nearer
to
your
own
*NL*
position
in
life
than
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
that
's
very
well
,
''
said
Wildeve
peremptorily
.
``
But
we
*NL*
must
look
at
things
as
they
are
.
Whatever
blame
may
attach
to
me
for
*NL*
having
brought
it
about
,
Thomasin
's
position
is
at
present
much
worse
*NL*
than
yours
.
I
simply
tell
you
that
I
am
in
a
strait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
shall
not
tell
me
!
You
must
see
that
it
is
only
harassing
me
.
*NL*
Damon
,
you
have
not
acted
well
;
you
have
sunk
in
my
opinion
.
You
have
*NL*
not
valued
my
courtesy
--
the
courtesy
of
a
lady
in
loving
you
--
who
used
*NL*
to
think
of
far
more
ambitious
things
.
But
it
was
Thomasin
's
fault
.
*NL*
She
won
you
away
from
me
,
and
she
deserves
to
suffer
for
it
.
Where
*NL*
is
she
staying
now
?
Not
that
I
care
,
nor
where
I
am
myself
.
Ah
,
if
I
*NL*
were
dead
and
gone
how
glad
she
would
be
!
Where
is
she
,
I
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomasin
is
now
staying
at
her
aunt
's
shut
up
in
a
bedroom
,
and
*NL*
keeping
out
of
everybody
's
sight

''
he
said
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
you
care
much
about
her
even
now
,
''
said
Eustacia
with
*NL*
sudden
joyousness
:
``
for
if
you
did
you
would
n't
talk
so
coolly
about
*NL*
her

Do
you
talk
so
coolly
to
her
about
me
?
Ah
,
I
expect
you
do
!
Why
*NL*
did
you
originally
go
away
from
me
?
I
do
n't
think
I
can
ever
forgive
*NL*
you
,
except
on
one
condition
,
that
whenever
you
desert
me
,
you
come
*NL*
back
again
,
sorry
that
you
served
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
wish
to
desert
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
thank
you
for
that
.
I
should
hate
it
to
be
all
smooth
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
think
I
like
you
to
desert
me
a
little
once
now
and
then
.
*NL*
Love
is
the
dismallest
thing
where
the
lover
is
quite
honest
.
O
,
it
*NL*
is
a
shame
to
say
so
;
but
it
is
true
!
''
She
indulged
in
a
little
laugh
.
*NL*
``
My
low
spirits
begin
at
the
very
idea
.
Do
n't
you
offer
me
tame
love
,
*NL*
or
away
you
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
Tamsie
were
not
such
a
confoundedly
good
little
woman
,
''
said
*NL*
Wildeve
,
``
so
that
I
could
be
faithful
to
you
without
injuring
a
worthy
*NL*
person
.
It
is
I
who
am
the
sinner
after
all
;
I
am
not
worth
the
*NL*
little
finger
of
either
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
not
sacrifice
yourself
to
her
from
any
sense
of
*NL*
justice
,
''
replied
Eustacia
quickly
.
``
If
you
do
not
love
her
it
is
the
*NL*
most
merciful
thing
in
the
long
run
to
leave
her
as
she
is
.
That
's
*NL*
always
the
best
way
.
There
,
now
I
have
been
unwomanly
,
I
suppose
.
*NL*
When
you
have
left
me
I
am
always
angry
with
myself
for
things
that
I
*NL*
have
said
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
walked
a
pace
or
two
among
the
heather
without
replying
.
The
*NL*
pause
was
filled
up
by
the
intonation
of
a
pollard
thorn
a
little
way
*NL*
to
windward
,
the
breezes
filtering
through
its
unyielding
twigs
as
*NL*
through
a
strainer
.
It
was
as
if
the
night
sang
dirges
with
clenched
*NL*
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
,
half
sorrowfully
,
``
Since
meeting
you
last
,
it
has
*NL*
occurred
to
me
once
or
twice
that
perhaps
it
was
not
for
love
of
me
*NL*
you
did
not
marry
her
.
Tell
me
,
Damon
:
I
'll
try
to
bear
it

Had
I
*NL*
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
matter

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
press
me
to
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
see
I
have
been
too
ready
to
believe
in
my
own
*NL*
power

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
immediate
reason
was
that
the
license
would
not
do
for
the
*NL*
place
,
and
before
I
could
get
another
she
ran
away
.
Up
to
that
point
*NL*
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
Since
then
her
aunt
has
spoken
to
me
*NL*
in
a
tone
which
I
do
n't
at
all
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

am
nothing

only
trifle

with
me

Heaven
,
what
can
I

Eustacia
Vye

be
made
of

so

much
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

not

so
passionate

Eustacia

how
we
roved
among

these
bushes
last
year

when
the
hot
days
had
got
cool
,
and
the
shades
*NL*
of
the
hills
kept
us
almost
invisible
in
the
hollows
!

*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
in
moody
silence
till
she
said
,
``
Yes

how
I
used
to
*NL*
laugh
at
you
for
daring
to
look
up

have
well
made

``
Yes

*NL*
``
Sometimes

nicely

turn
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do

you
really
care
whether

meet
you

whether
I
do

she
*NL*
said
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
care
a
little
,
but
not
enough
to
break
my
rest

replied
the
young
*NL*
man
languidly
.
``
No

all
that
's
past

two

three

*NL*
She
interrupted
with
a
suppressed
fire
of
which
either
love
or
anger
*NL*
seemed
an
equally
possible
issue
,
``
Do
you
love
me
now
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
can
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
;
I
will
know
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

and
I
do
not

''
said
he
mischievously
.
``
That
is
,
I
have
my
*NL*
times
and
my
seasons
.
One
moment
you
are
too
tall
,
another
moment
you
*NL*
are
too
do-nothing
,
another
too
melancholy
,
another
too
dark
,
another
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
,
except
--
that
you
are
not
the
whole
world
to
me
that
*NL*
you
used
to
be
,
my
dear
.
But
you
are
a
pleasant
lady
to
know
,
and
nice
*NL*
to
meet
,
and
I
dare
say
as
sweet
as
ever

almost

''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
was
silent
,
and
she
turned
from
him
,
till
she
said
,
in
a
*NL*
voice
of
suspended
mightiness
,
``
I
am
for
a
walk
,
and
this
is
my
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
can
do
worse
than
follow
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
you
ca
n't
do
otherwise
,
for
all
your
moods
and
changes
!
''
*NL*
she
answered
defiantly
.
``
Say
what
you
will
;
try
as
you
may
;
keep
away
*NL*
from
me
all
that
you
can
--
you
will
never
forget
me
.
You
will
love
me
*NL*
all
your
life
long
.
You
would
jump
to
marry
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
would
!
''
said
Wildeve
.
``
Such
strange
thoughts
as
I
've
had
from
*NL*
time
to
time
,
Eustacia
;
and
they
come
to
me
this
moment
.
You
hate
the
*NL*
heath
as
much
as
ever
;
that
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
she
murmured
deeply
.
''
'T
is
my
cross
,
my
shame
,
and
will
be
my
*NL*
death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
abhor
it
too
,
''
said
he
.
``
How
mournfully
the
wind
blows
round
us
*NL*
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
Its
tone
was
indeed
solemn
and
pervasive
.
*NL*
Compound
utterances
addressed
themselves
to
their
senses
,
and
it
was
*NL*
possible
to
view
by
ear
the
features
of
the
neighbourhood
.
Acoustic
*NL*
pictures
were
returned
from
the
darkened
scenery
;
they
could
hear
*NL*
where
the
tracts
of
heather
began
and
ended
;
where
the
furze
was
*NL*
growing
stalky
and
tall
;
where
it
had
been
recently
cut
;
in
what
*NL*
direction
the
fir-clump
lay
,
and
how
near
was
the
pit
in
which
the
*NL*
hollies
grew
;
for
these
differing
features
had
their
voices
no
less
*NL*
than
their
shapes
and
colours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
,
how
lonely
it
is
!
''
resumed
Wildeve
.
``
What
are
picturesque
*NL*
ravines
and
mists
to
us
who
see
nothing
else
?
Why
should
we
stay
*NL*
here
?
Will
you
go
with
me
to
America
?
I
have
kindred
in
Wisconsin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
wants
consideration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
impossible
to
do
well
here
,
unless
one
were
a
wild
bird
or
a
*NL*
landscape-painter
.
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
time
,
''
she
softly
said
,
taking
his
hand
.
``
America
is
so
far
*NL*
away
.
Are
you
going
to
walk
with
me
a
little
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Eustacia
uttered
the
latter
words
she
retired
from
the
base
of
the
*NL*
barrow
,
and
Wildeve
followed
her
,
so
that
the
reddleman
could
hear
no
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
the
turves
and
arose
.
Their
black
figures
sank
and
*NL*
disappeared
from
against
the
sky
.
They
were
as
two
horns
which
the
*NL*
sluggish
heath
had
put
forth
from
its
crown
,
like
a
mollusc
,
and
had
*NL*
now
again
drawn
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
's
walk
across
the
vale
,
and
over
into
the
next
where
his
*NL*
cart
lay
,
was
not
sprightly
for
a
slim
young
fellow
of
twenty-four
.
*NL*
His
spirit
was
perturbed
to
aching
.
The
breezes
that
blew
around
his
*NL*
mouth
in
that
walk
carried
off
upon
them
the
accents
of
a
commination
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
the
van
,
where
there
was
a
fire
in
a
stove
.
Without
*NL*
lighting
his
candle
he
sat
down
at
once
on
the
three-legged
stool
,
and
*NL*
pondered
on
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
touching
that
still
loved-one
*NL*
of
his
.
He
uttered
a
sound
which
was
neither
sigh
nor
sob
,
but
was
*NL*
even
more
indicative
than
either
of
a
troubled
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Tamsie
,
''
he
whispered
heavily
.
``
What
can
be
done
?
Yes
,
I
will
see
*NL*
that
Eustacia
Vye

X

*NL*
A
Desperate
Attempt
at
Persuasion
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
at
the
time
when
the
height
of
the
sun
appeared
very
*NL*
insignificant
from
any
part
of
the
heath
as
compared
with
the
altitude
*NL*
of
Rainbarrow
,
and
when
all
the
little
hills
in
the
lower
levels
were
*NL*
like
an
archipelago
in
a
fog-formed
Aegean
,
the
reddleman
came
from
*NL*
the
brambled
nook
which
he
had
adopted
as
his
quarters
and
ascended
*NL*
the
slopes
of
Mistover
Knap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
these
shaggy
hills
were
apparently
so
solitary
,
several
keen
*NL*
round
eyes
were
always
ready
on
such
a
wintry
morning
as
this
to
*NL*
converge
upon
a
passer-by
.
Feathered
species
sojourned
here
in
hiding
*NL*
which
would
have
created
wonder
if
found
elsewhere
.
A
bustard
haunted
*NL*
the
spot
,
and
not
many
years
before
this
five
and
twenty
might
have
*NL*
been
seen
in
Egdon
at
one
time
.
Marsh-harriers
looked
up
from
the
*NL*
valley
by
Wildeve
's
.
A
cream-coloured
courser
had
used
to
visit
this
*NL*
hill
,
a
bird
so
rare
that
not
more
than
a
dozen
have
ever
been
seen
*NL*
in
England
;
but
a
barbarian
rested
neither
night
nor
day
till
he
had
*NL*
shot
the
African
truant
,
and
after
that
event
cream-coloured
coursers
*NL*
thought
fit
to
enter
Egdon
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
traveller
who
should
walk
and
observe
any
of
these
visitants
as
Venn
*NL*
observed
them
now
could
feel
himself
to
be
in
direct
communication
*NL*
with
regions
unknown
to
man
.
Here
in
front
of
him
was
a
wild
*NL*
mallard
--
just
arrived
from
the
home
of
the
north
wind
.
The
creature
*NL*
brought
within
him
an
amplitude
of
Northern
knowledge
.
Glacial
*NL*
catastrophes
,
snowstorm
episodes
,
glittering
auroral
effects
,
Polaris
*NL*
in
the
zenith
,
Franklin
underfoot
,
--
the
category
of
his
commonplaces
*NL*
was
wonderful
.
But
the
bird
,
like
many
other
philosophers
,
seemed
*NL*
as
he
looked
at
the
reddleman
to
think
that
a
present
moment
of
*NL*
comfortable
reality
was
worth
a
decade
of
memories
.
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
passed
on
through
these
towards
the
house
of
the
isolated
beauty
*NL*
who
lived
up
among
them
and
despised
them
.
The
day
was
Sunday
;
but
*NL*
as
going
to
church
,
except
to
be
married
or
buried
,
was
exceptional
*NL*
at
Egdon
,
this
made
little
difference
.
He
had
determined
upon
the
*NL*
bold
stroke
of
asking
for
an
interview
with
Miss
Vye
--
to
attack
*NL*
her
position
as
Thomasin
's
rival
either
by
art
or
by
storm
,
*NL*
showing
therein
,
somewhat
too
conspicuously
,
the
want
of
gallantry
*NL*
characteristic
of
a
certain
astute
sort
of
men
,
from
clowns
to
kings
.
*NL*
The
great
Frederick
making
war
on
the
beautiful
Archduchess
,
Napoleon
*NL*
refusing
terms
to
the
beautiful
Queen
of
Prussia
,
were
not
more
dead
*NL*
to
difference
of
sex
than
the
reddleman
was
,
in
his
peculiar
way
,
in
*NL*
planning
the
displacement
of
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
call
at
the
captain
's
cottage
was
always
more
or
less
an
*NL*
undertaking
for
the
inferior
inhabitants
.
Though
occasionally
chatty
,
*NL*
his
moods
were
erratic
,
and
nobody
could
be
certain
how
he
would
*NL*
behave
at
any
particular
moment
.
Eustacia
was
reserved
,
and
lived
*NL*
very
much
to
herself
.
Except
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
cotters
,
who
*NL*
was
their
servant
,
and
a
lad
who
worked
in
the
garden
and
stable
,
*NL*
scarcely
anyone
but
themselves
ever
entered
the
house
.
They
were
the
*NL*
only
genteel
people
of
the
district
except
the
Yeobrights
,
and
though
*NL*
far
from
rich
,
they
did
not
feel
that
necessity
for
preserving
a
*NL*
friendly
face
towards
every
man
,
bird
,
and
beast
which
influenced
*NL*
their
poorer
neighbours
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
reddleman
entered
the
garden
the
old
man
was
looking
through
*NL*
his
glass
at
the
stain
of
blue
sea
in
the
distant
landscape
,
the
*NL*
little
anchors
on
his
buttons
twinkling
in
the
sun
.
He
recognized
*NL*
Venn
as
his
companion
on
the
highway
,
but
made
no
remark
on
that
*NL*
circumstance
,
merely
saying
,
``
Ah
,
reddleman
--
you
here
?
Have
a
glass
*NL*
of
grog
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
declined
,
on
the
plea
of
it
being
too
early
,
and
stated
that
*NL*
his
business
was
with
Miss
Vye
.
The
captain
surveyed
him
from
cap
*NL*
to
waistcoat
and
from
waistcoat
to
leggings
for
a
few
moments
,
and
*NL*
finally
asked
him
to
go
indoors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Vye
was
not
to
be
seen
by
anybody
just
then
;
and
the
reddleman
*NL*
waited
in
the
window-bench
of
the
kitchen
,
his
hands
hanging
across
*NL*
his
divergent
knees
,
and
his
cap
hanging
from
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
the
young
lady
is
not
up
yet
?
''
he
presently
said
to
the
*NL*
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
yet
.
Folks
never
call
upon
ladies
at
this
time
of
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
step
outside
,
''
said
Venn
.
``
If
she
is
willing
to
see
me
,
*NL*
will
she
please
send
out
word
,
and
I
'll
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
left
the
house
and
loitered
on
the
hill
adjoining
.
*NL*
A
considerable
time
elapsed
,
and
no
request
for
his
presence
was
*NL*
brought
.
He
was
beginning
to
think
that
his
scheme
had
failed
,
when
*NL*
he
beheld
the
form
of
Eustacia
herself
coming
leisurely
towards
him
.
*NL*
A
sense
of
novelty
in
giving
audience
to
that
singular
figure
had
been
*NL*
sufficient
to
draw
her
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
feel
,
after
a
bare
look
at
Diggory
Venn
,
that
the
man
*NL*
had
come
on
a
strange
errand
,
and
that
he
was
not
so
mean
as
she
*NL*
had
thought
him
;
for
her
close
approach
did
not
cause
him
to
writhe
*NL*
uneasily
,
or
shift
his
feet
,
or
show
any
of
those
little
signs
which
*NL*
escape
an
ingenuous
rustic
at
the
advent
of
the
uncommon
in
womankind
.
*NL*
On
his
inquiring
if
he
might
have
a
conversation
with
her
she
replied
,
*NL*
``
Yes
,
walk
beside
me
,
''
and
continued
to
move
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
they
had
gone
far
it
occurred
to
the
perspicacious
*NL*
reddleman
that
he
would
have
acted
more
wisely
by
appearing
less
*NL*
unimpressionable
,
and
he
resolved
to
correct
the
error
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
could
find
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
made
so
bold
,
miss
,
as
to
step
across
and
tell
you
some
*NL*
strange
news
which
has
come
to
my
ears
about
that
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
what
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
jerked
his
elbow
to
the
south-east
--
the
direction
of
the
Quiet
*NL*
Woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
turned
quickly
to
him
.
``
Do
you
mean
Mr.
Wildeve
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
is
trouble
in
a
household
on
account
of
him
,
and
I
have
*NL*
come
to
let
you
know
of
it
,
because
I
believe
you
might
have
power
to
*NL*
drive
it
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
What
is
the
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
a
secret
.
It
is
that
he
may
refuse
to
marry
Thomasin
*NL*
Yeobright
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
,
though
set
inwardly
pulsing
by
his
words
,
was
equal
to
her
*NL*
part
in
such
a
drama
as
this
.
She
replied
coldly
,
``
I
do
not
wish
to
*NL*
listen
to
this
,
and
you
must
not
expect
me
to
interfere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
miss
,
you
will
hear
one
word
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
.
I
am
not
interested
in
the
marriage
,
and
even
if
I
were
I
*NL*
could
not
compel
Mr.
Wildeve
to
do
my
bidding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
the
only
lady
on
the
heath
I
think
you
might
,
''
said
Venn
with
*NL*
subtle
indirectness
.
``
This
is
how
the
case
stands
.
Mr.
Wildeve
would
*NL*
marry
Thomasin
at
once
,
and
make
all
matters
smooth
,
if
so
be
there
*NL*
were
not
another
woman
in
the
case
.
This
other
woman
is
some
person
*NL*
he
has
picked
up
with
,
and
meets
on
the
heath
occasionally
,
I
believe
.
*NL*
He
will
never
marry
her
,
and
yet
through
her
he
may
never
marry
the
*NL*
woman
who
loves
him
dearly
.
Now
,
if
you
,
miss
,
who
have
so
much
sway
*NL*
over
us
men-folk
,
were
to
insist
that
he
should
treat
your
young
*NL*
neighbour
Tamsin
with
honourable
kindness
and
give
up
the
other
woman
,
*NL*
he
would
perhaps
do
it
,
and
save
her
a
good
deal
of
misery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
life
!
''
said
Eustacia
,
with
a
laugh
which
unclosed
her
lips
*NL*
so
that
the
sun
shone
into
her
mouth
as
into
a
tulip
,
and
lent
it
*NL*
a
similar
scarlet
fire
.
``
You
think
too
much
of
my
influence
over
*NL*
men-folk
indeed
,
reddleman
.
If
I
had
such
a
power
as
you
imagine
I
*NL*
would
go
straight
and
use
it
for
the
good
of
anybody
who
has
been
*NL*
kind
to
me

which
Thomasin
Yeobright
has
not
particularly

my

knowledge

*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
that
you
really
do
n't
know
of
it
--
how
much
she
had
always
*NL*
thought
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
heard
a
word
of
it
.
Although
we
live
only
two
miles
*NL*
apart
I
have
never
been
inside
her
aunt
's
house
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
superciliousness
that
lurked
in
her
manner
told
Venn
that
thus
far
*NL*
he
had
utterly
failed
.
He
inwardly
sighed
and
felt
it
necessary
to
*NL*
unmask
his
second
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
leaving
that
out
of
the
question
,
't
is
in
your
power
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
Miss
Vye
,
to
do
a
great
deal
of
good
to
another
woman

*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
comeliness
is
law
with
Mr.
Wildeve
.
It
is
law
with
all
men
who
*NL*
see

They
say
,
`
This
well-favoured
lady
coming
--
what
's
her
name
?
*NL*
How
handsome
!
'
Handsomer
than
Thomasin
Yeobright
,
''
the
reddleman
*NL*
persisted
,
saying
to
himself
,
``
God
forgive
a
rascal
for
lying
!
''
And
*NL*
she
was
handsomer
,
but
the
reddleman
was
far
from
thinking
so
.
There
*NL*
was
a
certain
obscurity
in
Eustacia
's
beauty
,
and
Venn
's
eye
was
not
*NL*
trained
.
In
her
winter
dress
,
as
now
,
she
was
like
the
tiger-beetle
,
*NL*
which
,
when
observed
in
dull
situations
,
seems
to
be
of
the
quietest
*NL*
neutral
colour
,
but
under
a
full
illumination
blazes
with
dazzling
*NL*
splendour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
could
not
help
replying
,
though
conscious
that
she
endangered
*NL*
her
dignity
thereby
.
``
Many
women
are
lovelier
than
Thomasin
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
``
so
not
much
attaches
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
suffered
the
wound
and
went
on
:
``
He
is
a
man
who
*NL*
notices
the
looks
of
women
,
and
you
could
twist
him
to
your
will
like
*NL*
withywind
,
if
you
only
had
the
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
what
she
can
not
do
who
has
been
so
much
with
him
I
can
not
do
*NL*
living
up
here
away
from
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
wheeled
and
looked
her
in
the
face
.
``
Miss
Vye
!
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
that
--
as
if
you
doubted
me
?
''
She
spoke
faintly
,
and
*NL*
her
breathing
was
quick
.
``
The
idea
of
your
speaking
in
that
tone
to
*NL*
me
!
''
she
added
,
with
a
forced
smile
of
hauteur
.
``
What
could
have
been
*NL*
in
your
mind
to
lead
you
to
speak
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Vye
,
why
should
you
make
believe
that
you
do
n't
know
this
*NL*
man
?
--
I
know
why
,
certainly
.
He
is
beneath
you
,
and
you
are
ashamed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
.
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
had
decided
to
play
the
card
of
truth
.
``
I
was
at
the
*NL*
meeting
by
Rainbarrow
last
night
and
heard
every
word
,
''
he
said
.
``
The
*NL*
woman
that
stands
between
Wildeve
and
Thomasin
is
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
disconcerting
lift
of
the
curtain
,
and
the
mortification
of
*NL*
Candaules
'
wife
glowed
in
her
.
The
moment
had
arrived
when
her
lip
*NL*
would
tremble
in
spite
of
herself
,
and
when
the
gasp
could
no
longer
*NL*
be
kept
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
unwell
,
''
she
said
hurriedly
.
``
No
--
it
is
not
that
--
I
am
not
in
a
*NL*
humour
to
hear
you
further
.
Leave
me
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
speak
,
Miss
Vye
,
in
spite
of
paining
you
.
What
I
would
put
*NL*
before
you
is
this
.
However
it
may
come
about
--
whether
she
is
to
*NL*
blame
,
or
you
--
her
case
is
without
doubt
worse
than
yours
.
Your
*NL*
giving
up
Mr.
Wildeve
will
be
a
real
advantage
to
you
,
for
how
could
*NL*
you
marry
him
?
Now
she
can
not
get
off
so
easily
--
everybody
will
blame
*NL*
her
if
she
loses
him
.
Then
I
ask
you
--
not
because
her
right
is
best
,
*NL*
but
because
her
situation
is
worst
--
to
give
him
up
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
wo
n't
,
I
wo
n't
!
''
she
said
impetuously
,
quite
forgetful
of
her
*NL*
previous
manner
towards
the
reddleman
as
an
underling
.
``
Nobody
has
*NL*
ever
been
served
so
!
It
was
going
on
well
--
I
will
not
be
beaten
*NL*
down
--
by
an
inferior
woman
like
her
.
It
is
very
well
for
you
to
come
*NL*
and
plead
for
her
,
but
is
she
not
herself
the
cause
of
all
her
own
*NL*
trouble
?
Am
I
not
to
show
favour
to
any
person
I
may
choose
without
*NL*
asking
permission
of
a
parcel
of
cottagers
?
She
has
come
between
me
*NL*
and
my
inclination
,
and
now
that
she
finds
herself
rightly
punished
*NL*
she
gets
you
to
plead
for
her
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

said
Venn
earnestly
,
``
she
knows
nothing
whatever
about
it

only
I
who
ask

up

will
be
better
for
her

you
both

will
say
bad
things
if
they
find
out
that
a

*NL*
secretly
meets
a
man
who
has
ill-used
another
woman

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
NOT
injured
her

was
mine
before

was
hers

He
came
*NL*
back

because

because
he
liked
me
best

she
said
wildly
.
``
But
I
*NL*
lose
all
self-respect
in
talking
to
you
.
What
am
I
giving
way
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
keep
secrets
,
''
said
Venn
gently
.
``
You
need
not
fear
.
I
am
the
*NL*
only
man
who
knows
of
your
meetings
with
him

There
is
but
one
thing
*NL*
more
to
speak
of
,
and
then
I
will
be
gone
.
I
heard
you
say
to
him
*NL*
that
you
hated
living
here
--
that
Egdon
Heath
was
a
jail
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
say
so

There
is
a
sort
of
beauty
in
the
scenery

I
know

*NL*
it
is
a
jail
to
me
.
The
man
you
mention
does
not
save
me
from
that
*NL*
feeling
,
though
he
lives
here

I
should
have
cared
nothing
for
him
*NL*

there
been
a
better

near

*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
looked
hopeful
;
after
these
words
from
her
his
third
*NL*
attempt
seemed
promising
.
``
As
we
have
now
opened
our
minds
a
bit
,
*NL*
miss

he
said
,
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
have
got
to

Since
I
*NL*
have
taken
to
the

I
travel
a
good
deal
,
as
you
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
inclined
her
head
,
and
swept
round
so
that
her
eyes
rested
in
the
*NL*
misty
vale
beneath
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
my
travels
I
go
near
Budmouth
.
Now
Budmouth
is
a
wonderful
*NL*
place
--
wonderful
--
a
great
salt
sheening
sea
bending
into
the
land
*NL*
like
a
bow
--
thousands
of
gentlepeople
walking
up
and
down
--
bands
of
*NL*
music
playing
--
officers
by
sea
and
officers
by
land
walking
among
the
*NL*
rest

out
of
every
ten
folks
you
meet
nine
of
'em
in
love

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
''
she
said
disdainfully
.
``
I
know
Budmouth
better
than
you

*NL*
I
was
born
there
.
My
father
came
to
be
a
military
musician
there
from
*NL*
abroad

Ah
,
my
soul
,
Budmouth
!
I
wish
I
was
there
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
was
surprised
to
see
how
a
slow
fire
could
blaze
on
*NL*
occasion
.
``
If
you
were
,
miss
,
''
he
replied
,
``
in
a
week
's
time
you
*NL*
would
think
no
more
of
Wildeve

of
one
of
those
he
`
th-croppers
*NL*
that
we
see
yond
.
Now
,
I
could
get
you
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
said
Eustacia
,
with
intense
curiosity
in
her
heavy
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
uncle

been
for
five
and
twenty
years
the
trusty
man
of
a
rich
*NL*
widow-lady
who

beautiful
house
facing
the
sea
.
This
lady
has
*NL*
become
old
and
lame

and
she
wants
a
young
company-keeper
to
read
and
*NL*
sing

tried
half
a
dozen

jump
to
get

would
make
it
all
easy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
to

perhaps

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

not

You

not
be
wanted

New
Year

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
meant
work

''
she
said
,
drooping
to
languor
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
there
would
be
a
trifle
to
do
in
the
way
of
amusing
her

though
idle
people
might
call
it
work

working

``
Help

proudly

*NL*
or
do
n't
you
want

find

for
your
goods
,
that
you
stay
idling
*NL*
here
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
spoke
not
another
word
.
With
his
hands
behind
him
he
turned
*NL*
away
,
that
she
might
not
see
the
hopeless
disappointment
in
his
face
.
*NL*
The
mental
clearness
and
power
he
had
found
in
this
lonely
girl
had
*NL*
indeed
filled
his
manner
with
misgiving
even
from
the
first
few
*NL*
minutes
of
close
quarters
with
her
.
Her
youth
and
situation
had
led
*NL*
him
to
expect
a
simplicity
quite
at
the
beck
of
his
method
.
But
a
*NL*
system
of
inducement
which
might
have
carried
weaker
country
lasses
*NL*
along
with
it
had
merely
repelled
Eustacia
.
As
a
rule
,
the
word
*NL*
Budmouth
meant
fascination
on
Egdon
.
That
Royal
port
and
watering
*NL*
place
,
if
truly
mirrored
in
the
minds
of
the
heath-folk
,
must
have
*NL*
combined
,
in
a
charming
and
indescribable
manner
,
a
Carthaginian
*NL*
bustle
of
building
with
Tarentine
luxuriousness
and
Baian
health
and
*NL*
beauty
.
Eustacia
felt
little
less
extravagantly
about
the
place
;
but
*NL*
she
would
not
sink
her
independence
to
get
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Diggory
Venn
had
gone
quite
away
,
Eustacia
walked
to
the
bank
and
*NL*
looked
down
the
wild
and
picturesque
vale
towards
the
sun
,
which
was
*NL*
also
in
the
direction
of
Wildeve
's
.
The
mist
had
now
so
far
collapsed
*NL*
that
the
tips
of
the
trees
and
bushes
around
his
house
could
just
be
*NL*
discerned
,
as
if
boring
upwards
through
a
vast
white
cobweb
which
*NL*
cloaked
them
from
the
day
.
There
was
no
doubt
that
her
mind
was
*NL*
inclined
thitherward
;
indefinitely
,
fancifully
--
twining
and
untwining
*NL*
about
him
as
the
single
object
within
her
horizon
on
which
dreams
*NL*
might
crystallize
.
The
man
who
had
begun
by
being
merely
her
*NL*
amusement
,
and
would
never
have
been
more
than
her
hobby
but
for
his
*NL*
skill
in
deserting
her
at
the
right
moments
,
was
now
again
her
desire
.
*NL*
Cessation
in
his
love-making
had
revivified
her
love
.
Such
feeling
*NL*
as
Eustacia
had
idly
given
to
Wildeve
was
dammed
into
a
flood
by
*NL*
Thomasin
.
She
had
used
to
tease
Wildeve
,
but
that
was
before
another
*NL*
had
favoured
him
.
Often
a
drop
of
irony
into
an
indifferent
situation
*NL*
renders
the
whole
piquant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
never
give
him
up
--
never
!
''
she
said
impetuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
's
hint
that
rumour
might
show
her
to
disadvantage
had
*NL*
no
permanent
terror
for
Eustacia
.
She
was
as
unconcerned
at
that
*NL*
contingency
as
a
goddess
at
a
lack
of
linen
.
This
did
not
originate
*NL*
in
inherent
shamelessness
,
but
in
her
living
too
far
from
the
world
to
*NL*
feel
the
impact
of
public
opinion
.
Zenobia
in
the
desert
could
hardly
*NL*
have
cared
what
was
said
about
her
at
Rome
.
As
far
as
social
ethics
*NL*
were
concerned
Eustacia
approached
the
savage
state
,
though
in
emotion
*NL*
she
was
all
the
while
an
epicure
.
She
had
advanced
to
the
secret
*NL*
recesses
of
sensuousness
,
yet
had
hardly
crossed
the
threshold
of
*NL*
conventionality
.

The
Dishonesty
of
an
Honest
Woman
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
had
left
Eustacia
's
presence
with
desponding
views
on
*NL*
Thomasin
's
future
happiness
;
but
he
was
awakened
to
the
fact
that
one
*NL*
other
channel
remained
untried
by
seeing
,
as
he
followed
the
way
to
*NL*
his
van
,
the
form
of
Mrs.
Yeobright
slowly
walking
towards
the
Quiet
*NL*
Woman
.
He
went
across
to
her
;
and
could
almost
perceive
in
her
anxious
*NL*
face
that
this
journey
of
hers
to
Wildeve
was
undertaken
with
the
same
*NL*
object
as
his
own
to
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
conceal
the
fact
.
``
Then
,
''
said
the
reddleman
,
``
you
may
as
*NL*
well
leave
it
alone
,
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
half
think
so
myself
,
''
she
said
.
``
But
nothing
else
remains
to
be
*NL*
done
besides
pressing
the
question
upon
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
say
a
word
first
,
''
said
Venn
firmly
.
``
Mr.
Wildeve
*NL*
is
not
the
only
man
who
has
asked
Thomasin
to
marry
him
;
and
why
*NL*
should
not
another
have
a
chance
?
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
I
should
be
glad
*NL*
to
marry
your
niece
,
and
would
have
done
it
any
time
these
last
two
*NL*
years
.
There
,
now
it
is
out
,
and
I
have
never
told
anybody
before
but
*NL*
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
was
not
demonstrative
,
but
her
eyes
involuntarily
*NL*
glanced
towards
his
singular
though
shapely
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looks
are
not
everything
,
''
said
the
reddleman
,
noticing
the
glance
.
*NL*
``
There
's
many
a
calling
that
do
n't
bring
in
so
much
as
mine
,
if
it
*NL*
comes
to
money
;
and
perhaps
I
am
not
so
much
worse
off
than
Wildeve
.
*NL*
There
is
nobody
so
poor
as
these
professional
fellows
who
have
failed
;
*NL*
and
if
you
should
n't
like
my
redness
--
well
,
I
am
not
red
by
birth
,
you
*NL*
know
;
I
only
took
to
this
business
for
a
freak
;
and
I
might
turn
my
*NL*
hand
to
something
else
in
good
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
interest
in
my
niece
;
but
I
fear
*NL*
there
would
be
objections
.
More
than
that
,
she
is
devoted
to
this
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
;
or
I
should
n't
have
done
what
I
have
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Otherwise
there
would
be
no
pain
in
the
case
,
and
you
would
not
see
*NL*
me
going
to
his
house
now
.
What
was
Thomasin
's
answer
when
you
told
*NL*
her
of
your
feelings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wrote
that
you
would
object
to
me
;
and
other
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
in
a
measure
right
.
You
must
not
take
this
unkindly
:
I
*NL*
merely
state
it
as
a
truth
.
You
have
been
good
to
her
,
and
we
do
not
*NL*
forget
it
.
But
as
she
was
unwilling
on
her
own
account
to
be
your
*NL*
wife
,
that
settles
the
point
without
my
wishes
being
concerned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
there
is
a
difference
between
then
and
now
,
ma'am
.
She
is
*NL*
distressed
now
,
and
I
have
thought
that
if
you
were
to
talk
to
her
*NL*
about
me
,
and
think
favourably
of
me
yourself
,
there
might
be
a
chance
*NL*
of
winning
her
round
,
and
getting
her
quite
independent
of
this
*NL*
Wildeve
's
backward
and
forward
play
,
and
his
not
knowing
whether
he
'll
*NL*
have
her
or
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
shook
her
head
.
``
Thomasin
thinks
,
and
I
think
with
*NL*
her
,
that
she
ought
to
be
Wildeve
's
wife
,
if
she
means
to
appear
*NL*
before
the
world
without
a
slur
upon
her
name
.
If
they
marry
soon
,
*NL*
everybody
will
believe
that
an
accident
did
really
prevent
the
*NL*
wedding
.
If
not
,
it
may
cast
a
shade
upon
her
character
--
at
any
rate
*NL*
make
her
ridiculous
.
In
short
,
if
it
is
anyhow
possible
they
must
*NL*
marry
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
that
till
half
an
hour
ago

But
,
after
all
,
why
should
*NL*
her
going
off
with
him
to
Anglebury
for
a
few
hours
do
her
any
harm
?
*NL*
Anybody
who
knows
how
pure
she
is
will
feel
any
such
thought
to
*NL*
be
quite
unjust
.
I
have
been
trying
this
morning
to
help
on
this
*NL*
marriage
with
Wildeve
--
yes
,
I
,
ma'am
--
in
the
belief
that
I
ought
to
*NL*
do
it
,
because
she
was
so
wrapped
up
in
him
.
But
I
much
question
if
*NL*
I
was
right
,
after
all
.
However
,
nothing
came
of
it
.
And
now
I
offer
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
appeared
disinclined
to
enter
further
into
the
*NL*
question
.
``
I
fear
I
must
go
on
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
do
not
see
that
*NL*
anything
else
can
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
went
on
.
But
though
this
conversation
did
not
divert
*NL*
Thomasin
's
aunt
from
her
purposed
interview
with
Wildeve
,
it
made
a
*NL*
considerable
difference
in
her
mode
of
conducting
that
interview
.
She
*NL*
thanked
God
for
the
weapon
which
the
reddleman
had
put
into
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
was
at
home
when
she
reached
the
inn
.
He
showed
her
silently
*NL*
into
the
parlour
,
and
closed
the
door
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
began
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
call
today
.
A
new
proposal
has
been
*NL*
made
to
me
,
which
has
rather
astonished
me
.
It
will
affect
Thomasin
*NL*
greatly
;
and
I
have
decided
that
it
should
at
least
be
mentioned
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
What
is
it
?
''
he
said
civilly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
of
course
,
in
reference
to
her
future
.
You
may
not
be
aware
*NL*
that
another
man
has
shown
himself
anxious
to
marry
Thomasin
.
Now
,
*NL*
though
I
have
not
encouraged
him
yet
,
I
can
not
conscientiously
refuse
*NL*
him
a
chance
any
longer
.
I
do
n't
wish
to
be
short
with
you
;
but
I
*NL*
must
be
fair
to
him
and
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
the
man
?
''
said
Wildeve
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
who
has
been
in
love
with
her
longer
than
she
has
with
you
.
He
*NL*
proposed
to
her
two
years
ago
.
At
that
time
she
refused
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
seen
her
lately
,
and
has
asked
me
for
permission
to
pay
his
*NL*
addresses
to
her
.
She
may
not
refuse
him
twice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
declined
to
say
.
``
He
is
a
man
Thomasin
likes
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
``
and
one
whose
constancy
she
respects
at
least
.
It
seems
to
me
*NL*
that
what
she
refused
then
she
would
be
glad
to
get
now
.
She
is
much
*NL*
annoyed
at
her
awkward
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
once
told
me
of
this
old
lover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentlest
women
are
not
such
fools
as
to
show
EVERY
card
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
she
wants
him
I
suppose
she
must
have
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
easy
enough
to
say
that
;
but
you
do
n't
see
the
difficulty
.
He
*NL*
wants
her
much
more
than
she
wants
him
;
and
before
I
can
encourage
*NL*
anything
of
the
sort
I
must
have
a
clear
understanding
from
you
that
*NL*
you
will
not
interfere
to
injure
an
arrangement
which
I
promote
in
the
*NL*
belief
that
it
is
for
the
best
.
Suppose
,
when
they
are
engaged
,
and
*NL*
everything
is
smoothly
arranged
for
their
marriage
,
that
you
should
*NL*
step
between
them
and
renew
your
suit
?
You
might
not
win
her
back
,
*NL*
but
you
might
cause
much
unhappiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
should
do
no
such
thing
,
''
said
Wildeve
``
But
they
are
not
*NL*
engaged
yet
.
How
do
you
know
that
Thomasin
would
accept
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
question
I
have
carefully
put
to
myself
;
and
upon
the
whole
*NL*
the
probabilities
are
in
favour
of
her
accepting
him
in
time
.
I
*NL*
flatter
myself
that
I
have
some
influence
over
her
.
She
is
pliable
,
*NL*
and
I
can
be
strong
in
my
recommendations
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
your
disparagement
of
me
at
the
same
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
may
depend
upon
my
not
praising
you
,
''
she
said
drily
.
``
And
*NL*
if
this
seems
like
manoeuvring
,
you
must
remember
that
her
position
is
*NL*
peculiar
,
and
that
she
has
been
hardly
used
.
I
shall
also
be
helped
*NL*
in
making
the
match
by
her
own
desire
to
escape
from
the
humiliation
*NL*
of
her
present
state
;
and
a
woman
's
pride
in
these
cases
will
lead
*NL*
her
a
very
great
way
.
A
little
managing
may
be
required
to
bring
her
*NL*
round
;
but
I
am
equal
to
that
,
provided
that
you
agree
to
the
one
*NL*
thing
indispensable
;
that
is
,
to
make
a
distinct
declaration
that
she
*NL*
is
to
think
no
more
of
you
as
a
possible
husband
.
That
will
pique
her
*NL*
into
accepting
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
hardly
say
that
just
now
,
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
It
is
so
sudden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
my
whole
plan
is
interfered
with
!
It
is
very
inconvenient
*NL*
that
you
refuse
to
help
my
family
even
to
the
small
extent
of
saying
*NL*
distinctly
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
reflected
uncomfortably
.
``
I
confess
I
was
not
prepared
for
*NL*
this
,
''
he
said
.
``
Of
course
I
'll
give
her
up
if
you
wish
,
if
it
is
*NL*
necessary
.
But
I
thought
I
might
be
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
heard
that
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
do
n't
let
us
disagree
.
Give
me
a
fair
time
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
stand
in
the
way
of
any
better
chance
she
may
have
;
only
*NL*
I
wish
you
had
let
me
know
earlier
.
I
will
write
to
you
or
call
in
a
*NL*
day
or
two
.
Will
that
suffice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
replied
,
``
provided
you
promise
not
to
communicate
with
*NL*
Thomasin
without
my
knowledge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
that
,
''
he
said
.
And
the
interview
then
terminated
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Yeobright
returning
homeward
as
she
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
far
the
greatest
effect
of
her
simple
strategy
on
that
day
was
,
as
*NL*
often
happens
,
in
a
quarter
quite
outside
her
view
when
arranging
it
.
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
her
visit
sent
Wildeve
the
same
evening
after
dark
*NL*
to
Eustacia
's
house
at
Mistover
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
hour
the
lonely
dwelling
was
closely
blinded
and
shuttered
*NL*
from
the
chill
and
darkness
without
.
Wildeve
's
clandestine
plan
with
*NL*
her
was
to
take
a
little
gravel
in
his
hand
and
hold
it
to
the
crevice
*NL*
at
the
top
of
the
window
shutter
,
which
was
on
the
outside
,
so
that
it
*NL*
should
fall
with
a
gentle
rustle
,
resembling
that
of
a
mouse
,
between
*NL*
shutter
and
glass
.
This
precaution
in
attracting
her
attention
was
to
*NL*
avoid
arousing
the
suspicions
of
her
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soft
words
,
``
I
hear
;
wait
for
me
,
''
in
Eustacia
's
voice
from
within
*NL*
told
him
that
she
was
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
in
his
customary
manner
by
walking
round
the
enclosure
and
*NL*
idling
by
the
pool
,
for
Wildeve
was
never
asked
into
the
house
by
his
*NL*
proud
though
condescending
mistress
.
She
showed
no
sign
of
coming
*NL*
out
in
a
hurry
.
The
time
wore
on
,
and
he
began
to
grow
impatient
.
In
*NL*
the
course
of
twenty
minutes
she
appeared
from
round
the
corner
,
and
*NL*
advanced
as
if
merely
taking
an
airing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
not
have
kept
me
so
long
had
you
known
what
I
come
about
,
''
*NL*
he
said
with
bitterness
.
``
Still
,
you
are
worth
waiting
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
?
''
said
Eustacia
.
``
I
did
not
know
you
were
in
*NL*
trouble
.
I
too
am
gloomy
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
in
trouble
,
''
said
he
.
``
It
is
merely
that
affairs
have
come
*NL*
to
a
head
,
and
I
must
take
a
clear
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
course
is
that
?
''
she
asked
with
attentive
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
can
you
forget
so
soon
what
I
proposed
to
you
the
other
night
?
*NL*
Why
,
take
you
from
this
place
,
and
carry
you
away
with
me
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
forgotten
.
But
why
have
you
come
so
unexpectedly
to
*NL*
repeat
the
question
,
when
you
only
promised
to
come
next
Saturday
?
I
*NL*
thought
I
was
to
have
plenty
of
time
to
consider
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
the
situation
is
different
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
explain
,
for
I
may
pain
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
know
the
reason
of
this
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
simply
my
ardour
,
dear
Eustacia
.
Everything
is
smooth
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
are
you
so
ruffled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
aware
of
it

All
is
as
it
should
be

Mrs.
Yeobright

is
nothing
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

I
knew

something

do

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

she
has
nothing

only

give
up

because
another
man
is
anxious
to
marry
her

The
woman
,
now
she
no
*NL*
longer
needs
me
,
actually
shows
off
!
''
Wildeve
's
vexation
had
escaped
*NL*
him
in
spite
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
was
silent
a
long
while
.
``
You
are
in
the
awkward
position
of
*NL*
an
official
who
is
no
longer
wanted
,
''
she
said
in
a
changed
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
so
.
But
I
have
not
yet
seen
Thomasin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
irritates
you
.
Do
n't
deny
it
,
Damon
.
You
are
actually
*NL*
nettled
by
this
slight
from
an
unexpected
quarter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
come
to
get
me
because
you
can
not
get
her
.
This
is
certainly
*NL*
a
new
position
altogether
.
I
am
to
be
a
stop-gap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
remember
that
I
proposed
the
same
thing
the
other
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
again
remained
in
a
sort
of
stupefied
silence
.
What
curious
*NL*
feeling
was
this
coming
over
her
?
Was
it
really
possible
that
her
*NL*
interest
in
Wildeve
had
been
so
entirely
the
result
of
antagonism
that
*NL*
the
glory
and
the
dream
departed
from
the
man
with
the
first
sound
*NL*
that
he
was
no
longer
coveted
by
her
rival
?
She
was
,
then
,
secure
*NL*
of
him
at
last
.
Thomasin
no
longer
required
him
.
What
a
humiliating
*NL*
victory
!
He
loved
her
best
,
she
thought
;
and
yet
--
dared
she
to
murmur
*NL*
such
treacherous
criticism
ever
so
softly
?
--
what
was
the
man
worth
*NL*
whom
a
woman
inferior
to
herself
did
not
value
?
The
sentiment
which
*NL*
lurks
more
or
less
in
all
animate
nature
--
that
of
not
desiring
the
*NL*
undesired
of
others
--
was
lively
as
a
passion
in
the
super-subtle
,
*NL*
epicurean
heart
of
Eustacia
.
Her
social
superiority
over
him
,
which
*NL*
hitherto
had
scarcely
ever
impressed
her
,
became
unpleasantly
*NL*
insistent
,
and
for
the
first
time
she
felt
that
she
had
stooped
in
*NL*
loving
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
darling
,
you
agree
?
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
could
be
London
,
or
even
Budmouth
,
instead
of
America
,
''
she
*NL*
murmured
languidly
.
``
Well
,
I
will
think
.
It
is
too
great
a
thing
for
*NL*
me
to
decide
offhand

I
wish
I
hated
the
heath
less
--
or
loved
you
*NL*
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
be
painfully
frank

loved
me
a

warmly
enough
*NL*
to
go
anywhere

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
loved
Thomasin

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
perhaps
that
was
where
the
reason
lay
,

he
returned
,
with
almost
*NL*
a
sneer
.
``
I
do
n't
hate
her
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly

The
only
thing
is
that
you

no

get

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

no

*NL*
``

only
have
come

I
am

Yes
,
yes

it
is
true

There
was
a
time
when
I
should

have

been
quite
wild

*NL*
``
I
want
to
get
away
from

at

said
with

weariness

``
A

consider

many

anxious

not

here
precisely
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
be

she

is

near

be
walking
out

have
made
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
watched
his
shadowy
form
till
it
had
disappeared
.
She
placed
*NL*
her
hand
to
her
forehead
and
breathed
heavily
;
and
then
her
rich
,
*NL*
romantic
lips
parted
under
that
homely
impulse
--
a
yawn
.
She
was
*NL*
immediately
angry
at
having
betrayed
even
to
herself
the
possible
*NL*
evanescence
of
her
passion
for
him
.
She
could
not
admit
at
once
that
*NL*
she
might
have
overestimated
Wildeve
,
for
to
perceive
his
mediocrity
*NL*
now
was
to
admit
her
own
great
folly
heretofore
.
And
the
discovery
*NL*
that
she
was
the
owner
of
a
disposition
so
purely
that
of
the
dog
in
*NL*
the
manger
had
something
in
it
which
at
first
made
her
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fruit
of
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
diplomacy
was
indeed
remarkable
,
though
*NL*
not
as
yet
of
the
kind
she
had
anticipated
.
It
had
appreciably
*NL*
influenced
Wildeve
,
but
it
was
influencing
Eustacia
far
more
.
Her
*NL*
lover
was
no
longer
to
her
an
exciting
man
whom
many
women
strove
*NL*
for
,
and
herself
could
only
retain
by
striving
with
them
.
He
was
a
*NL*
superfluity
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
indoors
in
that
peculiar
state
of
misery
which
is
not
exactly
*NL*
grief
,
and
which
especially
attends
the
dawnings
of
reason
in
the
*NL*
latter
days
of
an
ill-judged
,
transient
love
.
To
be
conscious
that
*NL*
the
end
of
the
dream
is
approaching
,
and
yet
has
not
absolutely
come
,
*NL*
is
one
of
the
most
wearisome
as
well
as
the
most
curious
stages
along
*NL*
the
course
between
the
beginning
of
a
passion
and
its
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
grandfather
had
returned
,
and
was
busily
engaged
in
pouring
some
*NL*
gallons
of
newly
arrived
rum
into
the
square
bottles
of
his
square
*NL*
cellaret
.
Whenever
these
home
supplies
were
exhausted
he
would
go
to
*NL*
the
Quiet
Woman
,
and
,
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
grog
in
*NL*
hand
,
tell
remarkable
stories
of
how
he
had
lived
seven
years
under
*NL*
the
water-line
of
his
ship
,
and
other
naval
wonders
,
to
the
natives
,
*NL*
who
hoped
too
earnestly
for
a
treat
of
ale
from
the
teller
to
exhibit
*NL*
any
doubts
of
his
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
there
this
evening
.
``
I
suppose
you
have
heard
the
Egdon
*NL*
news

?

he
said
,
without
looking
up
from
the
bottles
.
``
The
*NL*
men
have
been
talking
about
it
at
the
Woman
as
if
it
were
of
national
*NL*
importance

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said

BOOK
SECOND
*NL*
THE
ARRIVAL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
Tidings
of
the
Comer
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
fine
days
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
and
earlier
,
certain
ephemeral
*NL*
operations
were
apt
to
disturb
,
in
their
trifling
way
,
the
majestic
*NL*
calm
of
Egdon
Heath
.
They
were
activities
which
,
beside
those
of
a
*NL*
town
,
a
village
,
or
even
a
farm
,
would
have
appeared
as
the
ferment
of
*NL*
stagnation
merely
,
a
creeping
of
the
flesh
of
somnolence
.
But
here
,
*NL*
away
from
comparisons
,
shut
in
by
the
stable
hills
,
among
which
mere
*NL*
walking
had
the
novelty
of
pageantry
,
and
where
any
man
could
imagine
*NL*
himself
to
be
Adam
without
the
least
difficulty
,
they
attracted
the
*NL*
attention
of
every
bird
within
eyeshot
,
every
reptile
not
yet
asleep
,
*NL*
and
set
the
surrounding
rabbits
curiously
watching
from
hillocks
at
a
*NL*
safe
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
performance
was
that
of
bringing
together
and
building
into
a
*NL*
stack
the
furze-faggots
which
Humphrey
had
been
cutting
for
the
*NL*
captain
's
use
during
the
foregoing
fine
days
.
The
stack
was
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
dwelling
,
and
the
men
engaged
in
building
it
were
Humphrey
*NL*
and
Sam
,
the
old
man
looking
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
fine
and
quiet
afternoon
,
about
three
o'clock
;
but
the
winter
*NL*
solstice
having
stealthily
come
on
,
the
lowness
of
the
sun
caused
*NL*
the
hour
to
seem
later
than
it
actually
was
,
there
being
little
here
*NL*
to
remind
an
inhabitant
that
he
must
unlearn
his
summer
experience
*NL*
of
the
sky
as
a
dial
.
In
the
course
of
many
days
and
weeks
sunrise
*NL*
had
advanced
its
quarters
from
north-east
to
south-east
,
sunset
had
*NL*
receded
from
north-west
to
south-west
;
but
Egdon
had
hardly
heeded
the
*NL*
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
was
indoors
in
the
dining-room
,
which
was
really
more
like
a
*NL*
kitchen
,
having
a
stone
floor
and
a
gaping
chimney-corner
.
The
air
was
*NL*
still
,
and
while
she
lingered
a
moment
here
alone
sounds
of
voices
in
*NL*
conversation
came
to
her
ears
directly
down
the
chimney
.
She
entered
*NL*
the
recess
,
and
,
listening
,
looked
up
the
old
irregular
shaft
,
with
*NL*
its
cavernous
hollows
,
where
the
smoke
blundered
about
on
its
way
*NL*
to
the
square
bit
of
sky
at
the
top
,
from
which
the
daylight
struck
*NL*
down
with
a
pallid
glare
upon
the
tatters
of
soot
draping
the
flue
as
*NL*
seaweed
drapes
a
rocky
fissure
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remembered
:
the
furze-stack
was
not
far
from
the
chimney
,
and
the
*NL*
voices
were
those
of
the
workers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
grandfather
joined
in
the
conversation
.
``
That
lad
ought
never
to
*NL*
have
left
home
.
His
father
's
occupation
would
have
suited
him
best
,
*NL*
and
the
boy
should
have
followed
on
.
I
do
n't
believe
in
these
new
*NL*
moves
in
families
.
My
father
was
a
sailor
,
so
was
I
,
and
so
should
my
*NL*
son
have
been
if
I
had
had
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
place
he
's
been
living
at
is
Paris

said
Humphrey
,
``
and
they
*NL*
tell
me
't
is
where
the
king
's
head
was
cut
off
years
ago

My
poor
*NL*
mother
used
to
tell
me
about
that
business

used

ironing

one
afternoon
the
parson
came
in
and
said

chuckling

men
brought

down
to

cockpit
with
their
legs

arms
blown
to
Jericho

so

young

settled

go

can
well

Sam

a
good
thing

Humphrey

sight
of
times
*NL*
better
to
be
selling
diments

nobbling
about
here

a
place

replied
the
captain
.
``
Yes

away

neither

*NL*
``
They

real
perusing
man

with

notions
about

There

would
be

her

the
captain
shortly
;
after
which

*NL*
walked
away

Humphrey
when

*NL*

Yes

I
hear
,
for
she
will
bide
entirely
indoors

We
*NL*
never
see
her
out
now
,
scampering
over
the
furze
with
a
face
as
red
*NL*
as

as
she
used

*NL*
*NL*
While
the
furze-gatherers
had
desultorily
conversed
thus
Eustacia
's
*NL*
face
gradually
bent
to
the
hearth
in
a
profound
reverie
,
her
toe
*NL*
unconsciously
tapping
the
dry
turf
which
lay
burning
at
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
of
their
discourse
had
been
keenly
interesting
to
her
.
A
*NL*
young
and
clever
man
was
coming
into
that
lonely
heath
from
,
of
all
*NL*
contrasting
places
in
the
world
,
Paris
.
It
was
like
a
man
coming
from
*NL*
heaven
.
More
singular
still
,
the
heathmen
had
instinctively
coupled
*NL*
her
and
this
man
together
in
their
minds
as
a
pair
born
for
each
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
five
minutes
of
overhearing
furnished
Eustacia
with
visions
*NL*
enough
to
fill
the
whole
blank
afternoon
.
Such
sudden
alternations
*NL*
from
mental
vacuity
do
sometimes
occur
thus
quietly
.
She
could
never
*NL*
have
believed
in
the
morning
that
her
colourless
inner
world
would
*NL*
before
night
become
as
animated
as
water
under
a
microscope
,
and
*NL*
that
without
the
arrival
of
a
single
visitor
.
The
words
of
Sam
and
*NL*
Humphrey
on
the
harmony
between
the
unknown
and
herself
had
on
her
*NL*
mind
the
effect
of
the
invading
Bard
's
prelude
in
the
``
Castle
of
*NL*
Indolence
,
''
at
which
myriads
of
imprisoned
shapes
arose
where
had
*NL*
previously
appeared
the
stillness
of
a
void
.
*NL*
*NL*
Involved
in
these
imaginings
she
knew
nothing
of
time
.
When
she
became
*NL*
conscious
of
externals
it
was
dusk
.
The
furze-rick
was
finished
;
the
*NL*
men
had
gone
home
.
Eustacia
went
upstairs
,
thinking
that
she
would
*NL*
take
a
walk
at
this
her
usual
time
;
and
she
determined
that
her
walk
*NL*
should
be
in
the
direction
of
Blooms-End
,
the
birthplace
of
young
*NL*
Yeobright
and
the
present
home
of
his
mother
.
She
had
no
reason
for
*NL*
walking
elsewhere
,
and
why
should
she
not
go
that
way
?
The
scene
of
a
*NL*
day-dream
is
sufficient
for
a
pilgrimage
at
nineteen
.
To
look
at
the
*NL*
palings
before
the
Yeobrights
'
house
had
the
dignity
of
a
necessary
*NL*
performance
.
Strange
that
such
a
piece
of
idling
should
have
seemed
*NL*
an
important
errand
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
,
leaving
the
house
,
descended
the
hill
on
*NL*
the
side
towards
Blooms-End
,
where
she
walked
slowly
along
the
valley
*NL*
for
a
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
.
This
brought
her
to
a
spot
in
*NL*
which
the
green
bottom
of
the
dale
began
to
widen
,
the
furze
bushes
*NL*
to
recede
yet
further
from
the
path
on
each
side
,
till
they
were
*NL*
diminished
to
an
isolated
one
here
and
there
by
the
increasing
*NL*
fertility
of
the
soil
.
Beyond
the
irregular
carpet
of
grass
was
a
*NL*
row
of
white
palings
,
which
marked
the
verge
of
the
heath
in
this
*NL*
latitude
.
They
showed
upon
the
dusky
scene
that
they
bordered
as
*NL*
distinctly
as
white
lace
on
velvet
.
Behind
the
white
palings
was
a
*NL*
little
garden
;
behind
the
garden
an
old
,
irregular
,
thatched
house
,
*NL*
facing
the
heath
,
and
commanding
a
full
view
of
the
valley
.
This
was
*NL*
the
obscure
,
removed
spot
to
which
was
about
to
return
a
man
whose
*NL*
latter
life
had
been
passed
in
the
French
capital
--
the
centre
and
*NL*
vortex
of
the
fashionable
world
.

The
People
at
Blooms-End
Make
Ready
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
afternoon
the
expected
arrival
of
the
subject
of
Eustacia
's
*NL*
ruminations
created
a
bustle
of
preparation
at
Blooms-End
.
Thomasin
*NL*
had
been
persuaded
by
her
aunt
,
and
by
an
instinctive
impulse
of
*NL*
loyalty
towards
her
cousin
Clym
,
to
bestir
herself
on
his
account
*NL*
with
an
alacrity
unusual
in
her
during
these
most
sorrowful
days
of
*NL*
her
life
.
At
the
time
that
Eustacia
was
listening
to
the
rickmakers
'
*NL*
conversation
on
Clym
's
return
,
Thomasin
was
climbing
into
a
loft
over
*NL*
her
aunt
's
fuel-house
,
where
the
store-apples
were
kept
,
to
search
out
*NL*
the
best
and
largest
of
them
for
the
coming
holiday-time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
loft
was
lighted
by
a
semicircular
hole
,
through
which
the
pigeons
*NL*
crept
to
their
lodgings
in
the
same
high
quarters
of
the
premises
;
and
*NL*
from
this
hole
the
sun
shone
in
a
bright
yellow
patch
upon
the
figure
*NL*
of
the
maiden
as
she
knelt
and
plunged
her
naked
arms
into
the
soft
*NL*
brown
fern
,
which
,
from
its
abundance
,
was
used
on
Egdon
in
packing
*NL*
away
stores
of
all
kinds
.
The
pigeons
were
flying
about
her
head
with
*NL*
the
greatest
unconcern
,
and
the
face
of
her
aunt
was
just
visible
*NL*
above
the
floor
of
the
loft
,
lit
by
a
few
stray
motes
of
light
,
as
she
*NL*
stood
half-way
up
the
ladder
,
looking
at
a
spot
into
which
she
was
not
*NL*
climber
enough
to
venture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
a
few
russets
,
Tamsin
.
He
used
to
like
them
almost
as
well
as
*NL*
ribstones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
turned
and
rolled
aside
the
fern
from
another
nook
,
where
*NL*
more
mellow
fruit
greeted
her
with
its
ripe
smell
.
Before
picking
*NL*
them
out
she
stopped
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Clym
,
I
wonder
how
your
face
looks
now
?
''
she
said
,
gazing
*NL*
abstractedly
at
the
pigeon-hole
,
which
admitted
the
sunlight
so
*NL*
directly
upon
her
brown
hair
and
transparent
tissues
that
it
almost
*NL*
seemed
to
shine
through
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
could
have
been
dear
to
you
in
another
way
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Yeobright
from
the
ladder
,
``
this
might
have
been
a
happy
meeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
use
in
saying
what
can
do
no
good
,
aunt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
her
aunt
,
with
some
warmth
.
``
To
thoroughly
fill
the
air
*NL*
with
the
past
misfortune
,
so
that
other
girls
may
take
warning
and
*NL*
keep
clear
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
lowered
her
face
to
the
apples
again
.
``
I
am
a
warning
to
*NL*
others
,
just
as
thieves
and
drunkards
and
gamblers
are
,
''
she
said
in
*NL*
a
low
voice
.
``
What
a
class
to
belong
to
!
Do
I
really
belong
to
them
?
*NL*
'T
is
absurd
!
Yet
why
,
aunt
,
does
everybody
keep
on
making
me
think
*NL*
that
I
do
,
by
the
way
they
behave
towards
me
?
Why
do
n't
people
judge
*NL*
me
by
my
acts
?
Now
,
look
at
me
as
I
kneel
here
,
picking
up
these
*NL*
apples
--
do
I
look
like
a
lost
woman
?
...
I
wish
all
good
women
were
as
*NL*
good
as
I
!
''
she
added
vehemently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strangers
do
n't
see
you
as
I
do
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
;
``
they
judge
*NL*
from
false
report
.
Well
,
it
is
a
silly
job
,
and
I
am
partly
to
*NL*
blame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
quickly
a
rash
thing
can
be
done
!
''
replied
the
girl
.
Her
lips
*NL*
were
quivering
,
and
tears
so
crowded
themselves
into
her
eyes
that
*NL*
she
could
hardly
distinguish
apples
from
fern
as
she
continued
*NL*
industriously
searching
to
hide
her
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
you
have
finished
getting
the
apples
,
''
her
aunt
said
,
*NL*
descending
the
ladder
,
``
come
down
,
and
we
'll
go
for
the
holly
.
There
*NL*
is
nobody
on
the
heath
this
afternoon
,
and
you
need
not
fear
being
*NL*
stared
at
.
We
must
get
some
berries
,
or
Clym
will
never
believe
in
*NL*
our
preparations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
came
down
when
the
apples
were
collected
,
and
together
they
*NL*
went
through
the
white
palings
to
the
heath
beyond
.
The
open
hills
*NL*
were
airy
and
clear
,
and
the
remote
atmosphere
appeared
,
as
it
often
*NL*
appears
on
a
fine
winter
day
,
in
distinct
planes
of
illumination
*NL*
independently
toned
,
the
rays
which
lit
the
nearer
tracts
of
landscape
*NL*
streaming
visibly
across
those
further
off
;
a
stratum
of
ensaffroned
*NL*
light
was
imposed
on
a
stratum
of
deep
blue
,
and
behind
these
lay
*NL*
still
remoter
scenes
wrapped
in
frigid
grey
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
the
place
where
the
hollies
grew
,
which
was
in
a
conical
*NL*
pit
,
so
that
the
tops
of
the
trees
were
not
much
above
the
general
*NL*
level
of
the
ground
.
Thomasin
stepped
up
into
a
fork
of
one
of
the
*NL*
bushes
,
as
she
had
done
under
happier
circumstances
on
many
similar
*NL*
occasions
,
and
with
a
small
chopper
that
they
had
brought
she
began
to
*NL*
lop
off
the
heavily-berried
boughs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
scratch
your
face
,
''
said
her
aunt
,
who
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
pit
,
regarding
the
girl
as
she
held
on
amid
the
glistening
green
and
*NL*
scarlet
masses
of
the
tree
.
``
Will
you
walk
with
me
to
meet
him
this
*NL*
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
.
Else
it
would
seem
as
if
I
had
forgotten
him
,
''
*NL*
said
Thomasin
,
tossing
out
a
bough
.
``
Not
that
that
would
matter
much
;
*NL*
I
belong
to
one
man
;
nothing
can
alter
that
.
And
that
man
I
must
*NL*
marry
,
for
my
pride
's
sake

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid

began
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
think

`
That
weak
girl

how
is
she
going
to
get
a
man

her
when
she
chooses
?

But
let
me
tell
you
one
thing

aunt

Wildeve

not
a
profligate
man

any
more

I
am

improper
woman

He
has
an
unfortunate
manner
,
and
does
n't
try
to
make
people
like
him
*NL*
if
they
do
n't
wish
to
do
it
of
their
own
accord

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomasin

said
Mrs.
Yeobright
quietly
,
fixing
her
eye
upon
her
*NL*
niece

present
moment
agree
to
be
*NL*
his
wife
if
that
had
not
happened
to
entangle
you
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
looked
into
the
tree
and
appeared
much
disturbed
.
``
Aunt
,
''
she
*NL*
said
presently
,
``
I
have
,
I
think
,
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
that
*NL*
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
think
what
you
choose
.
I
have
never
implied
to
you
by
word
*NL*
or
deed
that
I
have
grown
to
think
otherwise
of
him
,
and
I
never
will
.
*NL*
And
I
shall
marry
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
wait
till
he
repeats
his
offer
.
I
think
he
may
do
it
,
now
that
*NL*
he
knows
--
something
I
told
him
.
I
do
n't
for
a
moment
dispute
that
*NL*
it
is
the
most
proper
thing
for
you
to
marry
him
.
Much
as
I
have
*NL*
objected
to
him
in
bygone
days
,
I
agree
with
you
now
,
you
may
be
sure
.
*NL*
It
is
the
only
way
out
of
a
false
position
,
and
a
very
galling
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
tell
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
was
standing
in
the
way
of
another
lover
of
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
,
''
said
Thomasin
,
with
round
eyes
,
``
what
DO
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
alarmed
;
it
was
my
duty
.
I
can
say
no
more
about
it
now
,
*NL*
but
when
it
is
over
I
will
tell
you
exactly
what
I
said
,
and
why
I
*NL*
said
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
was
perforce
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
keep
the
secret
of
my
would-be
marriage
from
Clym
for
*NL*
the
present
?
''
she
next
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
given
my
word
to
.
But
what
is
the
use
of
it
?
He
must
soon
*NL*
know
what
has
happened
.
A
mere
look
at
your
face
will
show
him
that
*NL*
something
is
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
turned
and
regarded
her
aunt
from
the
tree
.
``
Now
,
hearken
to
*NL*
me
,
''
she
said
,
her
delicate
voice
expanding
into
firmness
by
a
force
*NL*
which
was
other
than
physical
.
``
Tell
him
nothing
.
If
he
finds
out
*NL*
that
I
am
not
worthy
to
be
his
cousin
,
let
him
.
But
,
since
he
loved
*NL*
me
once
,
we
will
not
pain
him
by
telling
him
my
trouble
too
soon
.
The
*NL*
air
is
full
of
the
story
,
I
know
;
but
gossips
will
not
dare
to
speak
*NL*
of
it
to
him
for
the
first
few
days
.
His
closeness
to
me
is
the
very
*NL*
thing
that
will
hinder
the
tale
from
reaching
him
early
.
If
I
am
not
*NL*
made
safe
from
sneers
in
a
week
or
two
I
will
tell
him
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
earnestness
with
which
Thomasin
spoke
prevented
further
*NL*
objections
.
Her
aunt
simply
said
,
``
Very
well
.
He
should
by
rights
*NL*
have
been
told
at
the
time
that
the
wedding
was
going
to
be
.
He
will
*NL*
never
forgive
you
for
your
secrecy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
will
,
when
he
knows
it
was
because
I
wished
to
spare
him
,
and
*NL*
that
I
did
not
expect
him
home
so
soon
.
And
you
must
not
let
me
stand
*NL*
in
the
way
of
your
Christmas
party
.
Putting
it
off
would
only
make
*NL*
matters
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
shall
not
.
I
do
not
wish
to
show
myself
beaten
before
*NL*
all
Egdon
,
and
the
sport
of
a
man
like
Wildeve
.
We
have
enough
*NL*
berries
now
,
I
think
,
and
we
had
better
take
them
home
.
By
the
time
*NL*
we
have
decked
the
house
with
this
and
hung
up
the
mistletoe
,
we
must
*NL*
think
of
starting
to
meet
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
came
out
of
the
tree
,
shook
from
her
hair
and
dress
the
loose
*NL*
berries
which
had
fallen
thereon
,
and
went
down
the
hill
with
her
*NL*
aunt
,
each
woman
bearing
half
the
gathered
boughs
.
It
was
now
nearly
*NL*
four
o'clock
,
and
the
sunlight
was
leaving
the
vales
.
When
the
west
*NL*
grew
red
the
two
relatives
came
again
from
the
house
and
plunged
into
*NL*
the
heath
in
a
different
direction
from
the
first
,
towards
a
point
in
*NL*
the
distant
highway
along
which
the
expected
man
was
to
return
.

III
*NL*
*NL*
How
a
Little
Sound
Produced
a
Great
Dream
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
stood
just
within
the
heath
,
straining
her
eyes
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
house
and
premises
.
No
light
,
sound
,
or
*NL*
movement
was
perceptible
there
.
The
evening
was
chilly
;
the
spot
was
*NL*
dark
and
lonely
.
She
inferred
that
the
guest
had
not
yet
come
;
and
*NL*
after
lingering
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
she
turned
again
towards
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
far
retraced
her
steps
when
sounds
in
front
of
her
*NL*
betokened
the
approach
of
persons
in
conversation
along
the
same
path
.
*NL*
Soon
their
heads
became
visible
against
the
sky
.
They
were
walking
*NL*
slowly
;
and
though
it
was
too
dark
for
much
discovery
of
character
*NL*
from
aspect
,
the
gait
of
them
showed
that
they
were
not
workers
on
the
*NL*
heath
.
Eustacia
stepped
a
little
out
of
the
foot-track
to
let
them
*NL*
pass
.
They
were
two
women
and
a
man
;
and
the
voices
of
the
women
were
*NL*
those
of
Mrs.
Yeobright
and
Thomasin
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
by
her
,
and
at
the
moment
of
passing
appeared
to
discern
her
*NL*
dusky
form
.
There
came
to
her
ears
in
a
masculine
voice
,
``
Good
*NL*
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
murmured
a
reply
,
glided
by
them
,
and
turned
round
.
She
could
*NL*
not
,
for
a
moment
,
believe
that
chance
,
unrequested
,
had
brought
into
*NL*
her
presence
the
soul
of
the
house
she
had
gone
to
inspect
,
the
man
*NL*
without
whom
her
inspection
would
not
have
been
thought
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
strained
her
eyes
to
see
them
,
but
was
unable
.
Such
was
her
*NL*
intentness
,
however
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
her
ears
were
performing
*NL*
the
functions
of
seeing
as
well
as
hearing
.
This
extension
of
power
*NL*
can
almost
be
believed
in
at
such
moments
.
The
deaf
Dr.
Kitto
was
*NL*
probably
under
the
influence
of
a
parallel
fancy
when
he
described
his
*NL*
body
as
having
become
,
by
long
endeavour
,
so
sensitive
to
vibrations
*NL*
that
he
had
gained
the
power
of
perceiving
by
it
as
by
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
follow
every
word
that
the
ramblers
uttered
.
They
were
*NL*
talking
no
secrets
.
They
were
merely
indulging
in
the
ordinary
*NL*
vivacious
chat
of
relatives
who
have
long
been
parted
in
person
though
*NL*
not
in
soul
.
But
it
was
not
to
the
words
that
Eustacia
listened
;
she
*NL*
could
not
even
have
recalled
,
a
few
minutes
later
,
what
the
words
*NL*
were
.
It
was
to
the
alternating
voice
that
gave
out
about
one-tenth
of
*NL*
them
--
the
voice
that
had
wished
her
good
night
.
Sometimes
this
throat
*NL*
uttered
Yes
,
sometimes
it
uttered
No
;
sometimes
it
made
inquiries
*NL*
about
a
timeworn
denizen
of
the
place
.
Once
it
surprised
her
notions
*NL*
by
remarking
upon
the
friendliness
and
geniality
written
in
the
faces
*NL*
of
the
hills
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
voices
passed
on
,
and
decayed
and
died
out
upon
her
ear
.
*NL*
Thus
much
had
been
granted
her
;
and
all
besides
withheld
.
No
event
*NL*
could
have
been
more
exciting
.
During
the
greater
part
of
the
*NL*
afternoon
she
had
been
entrancing
herself
by
imagining
the
fascination
*NL*
which
must
attend
a
man
come
direct
from
beautiful
Paris
--
laden
with
*NL*
its
atmosphere
,
familiar
with
its
charms
.
And
this
man
had
greeted
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
departure
of
the
figures
the
profuse
articulations
of
the
*NL*
women
wasted
away
from
her
memory
;
but
the
accents
of
the
other
stayed
*NL*
on
.
Was
there
anything
in
the
voice
of
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
son
--
for
Clym
*NL*
it
was
--
startling
as
a
sound
?
No
;
it
was
simply
comprehensive
.
All
*NL*
emotional
things
were
possible
to
the
speaker
of
that
``
good
night
.
''
*NL*
Eustacia
's
imagination
supplied
the
rest
--
except
the
solution
to
one
*NL*
riddle
.
What
COULD
the
tastes
of
that
man
be
who
saw
friendliness
and
*NL*
geniality
in
these
shaggy
hills
?
*NL*
*NL*
On
such
occasions
as
this
a
thousand
ideas
pass
through
a
highly
*NL*
charged
woman
's
head
;
and
they
indicate
themselves
on
her
face
;
but
*NL*
the
changes
,
though
actual
,
are
minute
.
Eustacia
's
features
went
*NL*
through
a
rhythmical
succession
of
them
.
She
glowed
;
remembering
the
*NL*
mendacity
of
the
imagination
,
she
flagged
;
then
she
freshened
;
then
*NL*
she
fired
;
then
she
cooled
again
.
It
was
a
cycle
of
aspects
,
produced
*NL*
by
a
cycle
of
visions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
entered
her
own
house
;
she
was
excited
.
Her
grandfather
was
*NL*
enjoying
himself
over
the
fire
,
raking
about
the
ashes
and
exposing
*NL*
the
red-hot
surface
of
the
turves
,
so
that
their
lurid
glare
*NL*
irradiated
the
chimney-corner
with
the
hues
of
a
furnace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
that
we
are
never
friendly
with
the
Yeobrights
?
''
she
said
,
*NL*
coming
forward
and
stretching
her
soft
hands
over
the
warmth
.
``
I
wish
*NL*
we
were
.
They
seem
to
be
very
nice
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
hanged
if
I
know
why
,
''
said
the
captain
.
``
I
liked
the
old
man
*NL*
well
enough
,
though
he
was
as
rough
as
a
hedge
.
But
you
would
never
*NL*
have
cared
to
go
there
,
even
if
you
might
have
,
I
am
well
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
town
tastes
would
find
them
far
too
countrified
.
They
sit
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
,
drink
mead
and
elderwine
,
and
sand
the
floor
to
keep
it
*NL*
clean
.
A
sensible
way
of
life
;
but
would
you
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
Mrs.
Yeobright
was
a
ladylike
woman
?
A
curate
's
daughter
,
*NL*
was
she
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
she
was
obliged
to
live
as
her
husband
did
;
and
I
suppose
*NL*
she
has
taken
kindly
to
it
by
this
time
.
Ah
,
I
recollect
that
I
once
*NL*
accidentally
offended
her
,
and
I
have
never
seen
her
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
was
an
eventful
one
to
Eustacia
's
brain
,
and
one
which
she
*NL*
hardly
ever
forgot
.
She
dreamt
a
dream
;
and
few
human
beings
,
from
*NL*
Nebuchadnezzar
to
the
Swaffham
tinker
,
ever
dreamt
a
more
remarkable
*NL*
one
.
Such
an
elaborately
developed
,
perplexing
,
exciting
dream
was
*NL*
certainly
never
dreamed
by
a
girl
in
Eustacia
's
situation
before
.
*NL*
It
had
as
many
ramifications
as
the
Cretan
labyrinth
,
as
many
*NL*
fluctuations
as
the
Northern
Lights
,
as
much
colour
as
a
parterre
*NL*
in
June
,
and
was
as
crowded
with
figures
as
a
coronation
.
To
Queen
*NL*
Scheherazade
the
dream
might
have
seemed
not
far
removed
from
*NL*
commonplace
;
and
to
a
girl
just
returned
from
all
the
courts
of
*NL*
Europe
it
might
have
seemed
not
more
than
interesting
.
But
amid
the
*NL*
circumstances
of
Eustacia
's
life
it
was
as
wonderful
as
a
dream
could
*NL*
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
however
,
gradually
evolved
from
its
transformation
scenes
a
*NL*
less
extravagant
episode
,
in
which
the
heath
dimly
appeared
behind
the
*NL*
general
brilliancy
of
the
action
.
She
was
dancing
to
wondrous
music
,
*NL*
and
her
partner
was
the
man
in
silver
armour
who
had
accompanied
her
*NL*
through
the
previous
fantastic
changes
,
the
visor
of
his
helmet
being
*NL*
closed
.
The
mazes
of
the
dance
were
ecstatic
.
Soft
whispering
came
*NL*
into
her
ear
from
under
the
radiant
helmet
,
and
she
felt
like
a
woman
*NL*
in
Paradise
.
Suddenly
these
two
wheeled
out
from
the
mass
of
dancers
,
*NL*
dived
into
one
of
the
pools
of
the
heath
,
and
came
out
somewhere
*NL*
beneath
into
an
iridescent
hollow
,
arched
with
rainbows
.
``
It
must
*NL*
be
here
,
''
said
the
voice
by
her
side
,
and
blushingly
looking
up
she
*NL*
saw
him
removing
his
casque
to
kiss
her
.
At
that
moment
there
was
a
*NL*
cracking
noise
,
and
his
figure
fell
into
fragments
like
a
pack
of
*NL*
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
cried
aloud
.
``
O
that
I
had
seen
his
face
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
awoke
.
The
cracking
had
been
that
of
the
window
shutter
*NL*
downstairs
,
which
the
maid-servant
was
opening
to
let
in
the
day
,
now
*NL*
slowly
increasing
to
Nature
's
meagre
allowance
at
this
sickly
time
of
*NL*
the
year
.
``
O
that
I
had
seen
his
face
!
''
she
said
again
.
''
'T
was
meant
*NL*
for
Mr.
Yeobright
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
became
cooler
she
perceived
that
many
of
the
phases
of
the
*NL*
dream
had
naturally
arisen
out
of
the
images
and
fancies
of
the
day
*NL*
before
.
But
this
detracted
little
from
its
interest
,
which
lay
in
the
*NL*
excellent
fuel
it
provided
for
newly
kindled
fervour
.
She
was
at
the
*NL*
modulating
point
between
indifference
and
love
,
at
the
stage
called
*NL*
``
having
a
fancy
for
.
''
It
occurs
once
in
the
history
of
the
most
*NL*
gigantic
passions
,
and
it
is
a
period
when
they
are
in
the
hands
of
*NL*
the
weakest
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
perfervid
woman
was
by
this
time
half
in
love
with
a
vision
.
The
*NL*
fantastic
nature
of
her
passion
,
which
lowered
her
as
an
intellect
,
*NL*
raised
her
as
a
soul
.
If
she
had
had
a
little
more
self-control
she
*NL*
would
have
attenuated
the
emotion
to
nothing
by
sheer
reasoning
,
and
*NL*
so
have
killed
it
off
.
If
she
had
had
a
little
less
pride
she
might
*NL*
have
gone
and
circumambulated
the
Yeobrights
'
premises
at
Blooms-End
*NL*
at
any
maidenly
sacrifice
until
she
had
seen
him
.
But
Eustacia
did
*NL*
neither
of
these
things
.
She
acted
as
the
most
exemplary
might
have
*NL*
acted
,
being
so
influenced
;
she
took
an
airing
twice
or
thrice
a
day
*NL*
upon
the
Egdon
hills
,
and
kept
her
eyes
employed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
occasion
passed
,
and
he
did
not
come
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
promenaded
a
second
time
,
and
was
again
the
sole
wanderer
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
time
there
was
a
dense
fog
;
she
looked
around
,
but
without
*NL*
much
hope
.
Even
if
he
had
been
walking
within
twenty
yards
of
her
she
*NL*
could
not
have
seen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
fourth
attempt
to
encounter
him
it
began
to
rain
in
torrents
,
*NL*
and
she
turned
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fifth
sally
was
in
the
afternoon
:
it
was
fine
,
and
she
remained
*NL*
out
long
,
walking
to
the
very
top
of
the
valley
in
which
Blooms-End
*NL*
lay
.
She
saw
the
white
paling
about
half
a
mile
off
;
but
he
did
not
*NL*
appear
.
It
was
almost
with
heart-sickness
that
she
came
home
and
with
*NL*
a
sense
of
shame
at
her
weakness
.
She
resolved
to
look
for
the
man
*NL*
from
Paris
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Providence
is
nothing
if
not
coquettish
;
and
no
sooner
had
*NL*
Eustacia
formed
this
resolve
than
the
opportunity
came
which
,
while
*NL*
sought
,
had
been
entirely
withholden
.
*NL*

IV
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
Is
Led
On
to
an
Adventure
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
of
this
last
day
of
expectation
,
which
was
the
*NL*
twenty-third
of
December
,
Eustacia
was
at
home
alone
.
She
had
*NL*
passed
the
recent
hour
in
lamenting
over
a
rumour
newly
come
to
*NL*
her
ears
--
that
Yeobright
's
visit
to
his
mother
was
to
be
of
short
*NL*
duration
,
and
would
end
some
time
the
next
week
.
``
Naturally
,
''
she
*NL*
said
to
herself
.
A
man
in
the
full
swing
of
his
activities
in
a
gay
*NL*
city
could
not
afford
to
linger
long
on
Egdon
Heath
.
That
she
would
*NL*
behold
face
to
face
the
owner
of
the
awakening
voice
within
the
limits
*NL*
of
such
a
holiday
was
most
unlikely
,
unless
she
were
to
haunt
the
*NL*
environs
of
his
mother
's
house
like
a
robin
,
to
do
which
was
difficult
*NL*
and
unseemly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
customary
expedient
of
provincial
girls
and
men
in
such
*NL*
circumstances
is
churchgoing
.
In
an
ordinary
village
or
country
town
*NL*
one
can
safely
calculate
that
,
either
on
Christmas-day
or
the
Sunday
*NL*
contiguous
,
any
native
home
for
the
holidays
,
who
has
not
through
age
*NL*
or
_
ennui
_
lost
the
appetite
for
seeing
and
being
seen
,
will
turn
*NL*
up
in
some
pew
or
other
,
shining
with
hope
,
self-consciousness
,
and
*NL*
new
clothes
.
Thus
the
congregation
on
Christmas
morning
is
mostly
*NL*
a
Tussaud
collection
of
celebrities
who
have
been
born
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
.
Hither
the
mistress
,
left
neglected
at
home
all
the
*NL*
year
,
can
steal
and
observe
the
development
of
the
returned
lover
who
*NL*
has
forgotten
her
,
and
think
as
she
watches
him
over
her
prayer-book
*NL*
that
he
may
throb
with
a
renewed
fidelity
when
novelties
have
lost
*NL*
their
charm
.
And
hither
a
comparatively
recent
settler
like
Eustacia
*NL*
may
betake
herself
to
scrutinize
the
person
of
a
native
son
who
left
*NL*
home
before
her
advent
upon
the
scene
,
and
consider
if
the
friendship
*NL*
of
his
parents
be
worth
cultivating
during
his
next
absence
in
order
*NL*
to
secure
a
knowledge
of
him
on
his
next
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
tender
schemes
were
not
feasible
among
the
scattered
*NL*
inhabitants
of
Egdon
Heath
.
In
name
they
were
parishioners
,
but
*NL*
virtually
they
belonged
to
no
parish
at
all
.
People
who
came
to
these
*NL*
few
isolated
houses
to
keep
Christmas
with
their
friends
remained
in
*NL*
their
friends
'
chimney-corners
drinking
mead
and
other
comforting
*NL*
liquors
till
they
left
again
for
good
and
all
.
Rain
,
snow
,
ice
,
mud
*NL*
everywhere
around
,
they
did
not
care
to
trudge
two
or
three
miles
to
*NL*
sit
wet-footed
and
splashed
to
the
nape
of
their
necks
among
those
*NL*
who
,
though
in
some
measure
neighbours
,
lived
close
to
the
church
,
and
*NL*
entered
it
clean
and
dry
.
Eustacia
knew
it
was
ten
to
one
that
Clym
*NL*
Yeobright
would
go
to
no
church
at
all
during
his
few
days
of
leave
,
*NL*
and
that
it
would
be
a
waste
of
labour
for
her
to
go
driving
the
pony
*NL*
and
gig
over
a
bad
road
in
hope
to
see
him
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dusk
,
and
she
was
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
dining-room
or
*NL*
hall
,
which
they
occupied
at
this
time
of
the
year
in
preference
to
*NL*
the
parlour
,
because
of
its
large
hearth
,
constructed
for
turf-fires
,
*NL*
a
fuel
the
captain
was
partial
to
in
the
winter
season
.
The
only
*NL*
visible
articles
in
the
room
were
those
on
the
window-sill
,
which
*NL*
showed
their
shapes
against
the
low
sky
:
the
middle
article
being
the
*NL*
old
hourglass
,
and
the
other
two
a
pair
of
ancient
British
urns
which
*NL*
had
been
dug
from
a
barrow
near
,
and
were
used
as
flower-pots
for
two
*NL*
razor-leaved
cactuses
.
Somebody
knocked
at
the
door
.
The
servant
was
*NL*
out
;
so
was
her
grandfather
.
The
person
,
after
waiting
a
minute
,
came
*NL*
in
and
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
there
?
''
said
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
Cap'n
Vye
,
will
you
let
us
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
arose
and
went
to
the
door
.
``
I
can
not
allow
you
to
come
in
*NL*
so
boldly
.
You
should
have
waited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cap'n
said
I
might
come
in
without
any
fuss
,
''
was
answered
in
a
*NL*
lad
's
pleasant
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
did
he
?
''
said
Eustacia
more
gently
.
``
What
do
you
want
,
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
will
your
grandfather
lend
us
his
fuel-house
to
try
over
our
*NL*
parts
in
,
tonight
at
seven
o'clock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
are
you
one
of
the
Egdon
mummers
for
this
year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
miss
.
The
cap'n
used
to
let
the
old
mummers
practise
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
.
Yes
,
you
may
use
the
fuel-house
if
you
like
,
''
said
*NL*
Eustacia
languidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
choice
of
Captain
Vye
's
fuel-house
as
the
scene
of
rehearsal
was
*NL*
dictated
by
the
fact
that
his
dwelling
was
nearly
in
the
centre
of
the
*NL*
heath
.
The
fuel-house
was
as
roomy
as
a
barn
,
and
was
a
most
desirable
*NL*
place
for
such
a
purpose
.
The
lads
who
formed
the
company
of
players
*NL*
lived
at
different
scattered
points
around
,
and
by
meeting
in
this
*NL*
spot
the
distances
to
be
traversed
by
all
the
comers
would
be
about
*NL*
equally
proportioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
mummers
and
mumming
Eustacia
had
the
greatest
contempt
.
The
*NL*
mummers
themselves
were
not
afflicted
with
any
such
feeling
for
*NL*
their
art
,
though
at
the
same
time
they
were
not
enthusiastic
.
A
*NL*
traditional
pastime
is
to
be
distinguished
from
a
mere
revival
in
no
*NL*
more
striking
feature
than
in
this
,
that
while
in
the
revival
all
is
*NL*
excitement
and
fervour
,
the
survival
is
carried
on
with
a
stolidity
*NL*
and
absence
of
stir
which
sets
one
wondering
why
a
thing
that
is
done
*NL*
so
perfunctorily
should
be
kept
up
at
all
.
Like
Balaam
and
other
*NL*
unwilling
prophets
,
the
agents
seem
moved
by
an
inner
compulsion
*NL*
to
say
and
do
their
allotted
parts
whether
they
will
or
no
.
This
*NL*
unweeting
manner
of
performance
is
the
true
ring
by
which
,
in
this
*NL*
refurbishing
age
,
a
fossilized
survival
may
be
known
from
a
spurious
*NL*
reproduction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
piece
was
the
well-known
play
of
``
Saint
George
,
''
and
all
who
were
*NL*
behind
the
scenes
assisted
in
the
preparations
,
including
the
women
*NL*
of
each
household
.
Without
the
cooperation
of
sisters
and
sweethearts
*NL*
the
dresses
were
likely
to
be
a
failure
;
but
on
the
other
hand
,
this
*NL*
class
of
assistance
was
not
without
its
drawbacks
.
The
girls
could
*NL*
never
be
brought
to
respect
tradition
in
designing
and
decorating
the
*NL*
armour
;
they
insisted
on
attaching
loops
and
bows
of
silk
and
velvet
*NL*
in
any
situation
pleasing
to
their
taste
.
Gorget
,
gusset
,
basinet
,
*NL*
cuirass
,
gauntlet
,
sleeve
,
all
alike
in
the
view
of
these
feminine
*NL*
eyes
were
practicable
spaces
whereon
to
sew
scraps
of
fluttering
*NL*
colour
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
that
Joe
,
who
fought
on
the
side
of
Christendom
,
had
a
*NL*
sweetheart
,
and
that
Jim
,
who
fought
on
the
side
of
the
Moslem
,
had
*NL*
one
likewise
.
During
the
making
of
the
costumes
it
would
come
to
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
Joe
's
sweetheart
that
Jim
's
was
putting
brilliant
silk
*NL*
scallops
at
the
bottom
of
her
lover
's
surcoat
,
in
addition
to
the
*NL*
ribbons
of
the
visor
,
the
bars
of
which
,
being
invariably
formed
of
*NL*
coloured
strips
about
half
an
inch
wide
hanging
before
the
face
,
*NL*
were
mostly
of
that
material
.
Joe
's
sweetheart
straightway
placed
*NL*
brilliant
silk
on
the
scallops
of
the
hem
in
question
,
and
,
going
a
*NL*
little
further
,
added
ribbon
tufts
to
the
shoulder
pieces
.
Jim
's
,
not
*NL*
to
be
outdone
,
would
affix
bows
and
rosettes
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
was
that
in
the
end
the
Valiant
Soldier
,
of
the
Christian
*NL*
army
,
was
distinguished
by
no
peculiarity
of
accoutrement
from
the
*NL*
Turkish
Knight
;
and
what
was
worse
,
on
a
casual
view
Saint
George
*NL*
himself
might
be
mistaken
for
his
deadly
enemy
,
the
Saracen
.
The
*NL*
guisers
themselves
,
though
inwardly
regretting
this
confusion
of
*NL*
persons
,
could
not
afford
to
offend
those
by
whose
assistance
they
*NL*
so
largely
profited
,
and
the
innovations
were
allowed
to
stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
it
is
true
,
a
limit
to
this
tendency
to
uniformity
.
*NL*
The
Leech
or
Doctor
preserved
his
character
intact
:
his
darker
*NL*
habiliments
,
peculiar
hat
,
and
the
bottle
of
physic
slung
under
his
*NL*
arm
,
could
never
be
mistaken
.
And
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
*NL*
conventional
figure
of
Father
Christmas
,
with
his
gigantic
club
,
an
*NL*
older
man
,
who
accompanied
the
band
as
general
protector
in
long
night
*NL*
journeys
from
parish
to
parish
,
and
was
bearer
of
the
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
o'clock
,
the
hour
of
the
rehearsal
,
came
round
,
and
in
a
short
*NL*
time
Eustacia
could
hear
voices
in
the
fuel-house
.
To
dissipate
in
*NL*
some
trifling
measure
her
abiding
sense
of
the
murkiness
of
human
life
*NL*
she
went
to
the
``
linhay
''
or
lean-to-shed
,
which
formed
the
root-store
*NL*
of
their
dwelling
and
abutted
on
the
fuel-house
.
Here
was
a
small
*NL*
rough
hole
in
the
mud
wall
,
originally
made
for
pigeons
,
through
which
*NL*
the
interior
of
the
next
shed
could
be
viewed
.
A
light
came
from
it
*NL*
now
;
and
Eustacia
stepped
upon
a
stool
to
look
in
upon
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
ledge
in
the
fuel-house
stood
three
tall
rush-lights
and
by
the
*NL*
light
of
them
seven
or
eight
lads
were
marching
about
,
haranguing
,
and
*NL*
confusing
each
other
,
in
endeavours
to
perfect
themselves
in
the
play
.
*NL*
Humphrey
and
Sam
,
the
furze
and
turf
cutters
,
were
there
looking
on
,
*NL*
so
also
was
Timothy
Fairway
,
who
leant
against
the
wall
and
prompted
*NL*
the
boys
from
memory
,
interspersing
among
the
set
words
remarks
and
*NL*
anecdotes
of
the
superior
days
when
he
and
others
were
the
Egdon
*NL*
mummers-elect
that
these
lads
were
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
ye
be
as
well
up
to
it
as
ever
ye
will
be
,
''
he
said
.
``
Not
that
*NL*
such
mumming
would
have
passed
in
our
time
.
Harry
as
the
Saracen
*NL*
should
strut
a
bit
more
,
and
John
need
n't
holler
his
inside
out
.
*NL*
Beyond
that
perhaps
you
'll
do
.
Have
you
got
all
your
clothes
ready
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
by
Monday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
first
outing
will
be
Monday
night

I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Yeobright

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mrs.
Yeobright

.
What
makes
her
want
to
see

I
should
think
*NL*
a
middle-aged
woman
was
tired
of
mumming

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
got
up
a
bit
of
a
party

't
is
the
first
Christmas

Clym
has
been
home
for
a
long
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure

be
sure

I
am
going
myself

I
almost
*NL*
forgot

,
upon
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
's
face
flagged
.
There
was
to
be
a
party
at
the
Yeobrights
'
;
*NL*
she
,
naturally
,
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
She
was
a
stranger
to
*NL*
all
such
local
gatherings
,
and
had
always
held
them
as
scarcely
*NL*
appertaining
to
her
sphere
.
But
had
she
been
going
,
what
an
*NL*
opportunity
would
have
been
afforded
her
of
seeing
the
man
whose
*NL*
influence
was
penetrating
her
like
summer
sun
!
To
increase
that
*NL*
influence
was
coveted
excitement
;
to
cast
it
off
might
be
to
regain
*NL*
serenity
;
to
leave
it
as
it
stood
was
tantalizing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lads
and
men
prepared
to
leave
the
premises
,
and
Eustacia
returned
*NL*
to
her
fireside
.
She
was
immersed
in
thought
,
but
not
for
long
.
In
a
*NL*
few
minutes
the
lad
Charley
,
who
had
come
to
ask
permission
to
use
the
*NL*
place
,
returned
with
the
key
to
the
kitchen
.
Eustacia
heard
him
,
and
*NL*
opening
the
door
into
the
passage
said
,
``
Charley
,
come
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
was
surprised
.
He
entered
the
front
room
not
without
*NL*
blushing
;
for
he
,
like
many
,
had
felt
the
power
of
this
girl
's
face
*NL*
and
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
to
a
seat
by
the
fire
,
and
entered
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
chimney-corner
herself
.
It
could
be
seen
in
her
face
that
whatever
*NL*
motive
she
might
have
had
in
asking
the
youth
indoors
would
soon
*NL*
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
part
do
you
play
,
Charley
--
the
Turkish
Knight
,
do
you
not
?
''
*NL*
inquired
the
beauty
,
looking
across
the
smoke
of
the
fire
to
him
on
*NL*
the
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
miss
,
the
Turkish
Knight
,
''
he
replied
diffidently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
yours
a
long
part
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nine
speeches
,
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
repeat
them
to
me
?
If
so
I
should
like
to
hear
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
smiled
into
the
glowing
turf
and
began
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
come
I
,
a
Turkish
Knight
,
*NL*
Who
learnt
in
Turkish
land
to
fight
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
continuing
the
discourse
throughout
the
scenes
to
the
concluding
*NL*
catastrophe
of
his
fall
by
the
hand
of
Saint
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
had
occasionally
heard
the
part
recited
before
.
When
the
lad
*NL*
ended
she
began
,
precisely
in
the
same
words
,
and
ranted
on
without
*NL*
hitch
or
divergence
till
she
too
reached
the
end
.
It
was
the
same
*NL*
thing
,
yet
how
different
.
Like
in
form
,
it
had
the
added
softness
*NL*
and
finish
of
a
Raffaelle
after
Perugino
,
which
,
while
faithfully
*NL*
reproducing
the
original
subject
,
entirely
distances
the
original
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
's
eyes
rounded
with
surprise
.
``
Well
,
you
be
a
clever
lady
!
''
*NL*
he
said
,
in
admiration
.
``
I
've
been
three
weeks
learning
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
it
before
,
''
she
quietly
observed
.
``
Now
,
would
you
do
*NL*
anything
to
please
me
,
Charley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
do
a
good
deal
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
let
me
play
your
part
for
one
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
miss
!
But
your
woman
's
gown
--
you
could
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
get
boy
's
clothes
--
at
least
all
that
would
be
wanted
besides
*NL*
the
mumming
dress
.
What
should
I
have
to
give
you
to
lend
me
your
*NL*
things
,
to
let
me
take
your
place
for
an
hour
or
two
on
Monday
night
,
*NL*
and
on
no
account
to
say
a
word
about
who
or
what
I
am
?
You
would
,
of
*NL*
course
,
have
to
excuse
yourself
from
playing
that
night
,
and
to
say
*NL*
that
somebody
--
a
cousin
of
Miss
Vye
's
--
would
act
for
you
.
The
other
*NL*
mummers
have
never
spoken
to
me
in
their
lives
,
so
that
it
would
be
*NL*
safe
enough
;
and
if
it
were
not
,
I
should
not
mind
.
Now
,
what
must
I
*NL*
give
you
to
agree
to
this
?
Half
a
crown
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
shook
his
head
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
shillings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
again
.
``
Money
wo
n't
do
it
,
''
he
said
,
brushing
the
*NL*
iron
head
of
the
fire-dog
with
the
hollow
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
,
then
,
Charley
?
''
said
Eustacia
in
a
disappointed
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
you
forbade
me
at
the
Maypoling
,
miss
,
''
murmured
the
*NL*
lad
,
without
looking
at
her
,
and
still
stroking
the
firedog
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Eustacia
,
with
a
little
more
hauteur
.
``
You
wanted
to
join
*NL*
hands
with
me
in
the
ring
,
if
I
recollect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
an
hour
of
that
,
and
I
'll
agree
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
regarded
the
youth
steadfastly
.
He
was
three
years
younger
*NL*
than
herself
,
but
apparently
not
backward
for
his
age
.
``
Half
an
hour
*NL*
of
what
?
''
she
said
,
though
she
guessed
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holding
your
hand
in
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
.
``
Make
it
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
Eustacia
--
I
will
,
if
I
may
kiss
it
too
.
A
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
.
And
I
'll
swear
to
do
the
best
I
can
to
let
you
take
my
place
*NL*
without
anybody
knowing
.
Do
n't
you
think
somebody
might
know
your
*NL*
tongue
,
miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
possible
.
But
I
will
put
a
pebble
in
my
mouth
to
make
is
less
*NL*
likely

Very
well
;
you
shall
be
allowed
to
have
my
hand
as
soon
as
*NL*
you
bring
the
dress
and
your
sword
and
staff
.
I
do
n't
want
you
any
*NL*
longer
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
departed
,
and
Eustacia
felt
more
and
more
interest
in
life
.
*NL*
Here
was
something
to
do
:
here
was
some
one
to
see
,
and
a
charmingly
*NL*
adventurous
way
to
see
him
.
``
Ah
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
want
of
an
*NL*
object
to
live
for
--
that
's
all
is
the
matter
with
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
's
manner
was
as
a
rule
of
a
slumberous
sort
,
her
passions
*NL*
being
of
the
massive
rather
than
the
vivacious
kind
.
But
when
aroused
*NL*
she
would
make
a
dash
which
,
just
for
the
time
,
was
not
unlike
the
*NL*
move
of
a
naturally
lively
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
question
of
recognition
she
was
somewhat
indifferent
.
By
*NL*
the
acting
lads
themselves
she
was
not
likely
to
be
known
.
With
the
*NL*
guests
who
might
be
assembled
she
was
hardly
so
secure
.
Yet
detection
,
*NL*
after
all
,
would
be
no
such
dreadful
thing
.
The
fact
only
could
be
*NL*
detected
,
her
true
motive
never
.
It
would
be
instantly
set
down
as
the
*NL*
passing
freak
of
a
girl
whose
ways
were
already
considered
singular
.
*NL*
That
she
was
doing
for
an
earnest
reason
what
would
most
naturally
be
*NL*
done
in
jest
was
at
any
rate
a
safe
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
evening
Eustacia
stood
punctually
at
the
fuel-house
door
,
*NL*
waiting
for
the
dusk
which
was
to
bring
Charley
with
the
trappings
.
*NL*
Her
grandfather
was
at
home
tonight
,
and
she
would
be
unable
to
ask
*NL*
her
confederate
indoors
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
appeared
on
the
dark
ridge
of
heathland
,
like
a
fly
on
a
negro
,
*NL*
bearing
the
articles
with
him
,
and
came
up
breathless
with
his
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
the
things
,
''
he
whispered
,
placing
them
upon
the
threshold
.
*NL*
``
And
now
,
Miss
Eustacia
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
payment
.
It
is
quite
ready
.
I
am
as
good
as
my
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
leant
against
the
door-post
,
and
gave
him
her
hand
.
Charley
took
*NL*
it
in
both
his
own
with
a
tenderness
beyond
description
,
unless
it
was
*NL*
like
that
of
a
child
holding
a
captured
sparrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
's
a
glove
on
it
!
''
he
said
in
a
deprecating
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
walking
,
''
she
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
miss
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
it
is
hardly
fair
.
''
She
pulled
off
the
glove
,
and
gave
him
her
*NL*
bare
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
together
minute
after
minute
,
without
further
speech
,
each
*NL*
looking
at
the
blackening
scene
,
and
each
thinking
his
and
her
own
*NL*
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
wo
n't
use
it
all
up
tonight
,
''
said
Charley
devotedly
,
when
*NL*
six
or
eight
minutes
had
been
passed
by
him
caressing
her
hand
.
``
May
*NL*
I
have
the
other
few
minutes
another
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like
,
''
said
she
without
the
least
emotion
.
``
But
it
must
be
*NL*
over
in
a
week
.
Now
,
there
is
only
one
thing
I
want
you
to
do
:
to
wait
*NL*
while
I
put
on
the
dress
,
and
then
to
see
if
I
do
my
part
properly
.
*NL*
But
let
me
look
first
indoors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
vanished
for
a
minute
or
two
,
and
went
in
.
Her
grandfather
was
*NL*
safely
asleep
in
his
chair
.
``
Now
,
then
,
''
she
said
,
on
returning
,
*NL*
``
walk
down
the
garden
a
little
way
,
and
when
I
am
ready
I
'll
call
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
walked
and
waited
,
and
presently
heard
a
soft
whistle
.
He
*NL*
returned
to
the
fuel-house
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
whistle
,
Miss
Vye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
come
in
,
''
reached
him
in
Eustacia
's
voice
from
a
back
quarter
.
*NL*
``
I
must
not
strike
a
light
till
the
door
is
shut
,
or
it
may
be
seen
*NL*
shining
.
Push
your
hat
into
the
hole
through
to
the
wash-house
,
if
*NL*
you
can
feel
your
way
across
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
did
as
commanded
,
and
she
struck
the
light
,
revealing
herself
*NL*
to
be
changed
in
sex
,
brilliant
in
colours
,
and
armed
from
top
to
*NL*
toe
.
Perhaps
she
quailed
a
little
under
Charley
's
vigorous
gaze
,
but
*NL*
whether
any
shyness
at
her
male
attire
appeared
upon
her
countenance
*NL*
could
not
be
seen
by
reason
of
the
strips
of
ribbon
which
used
to
*NL*
cover
the
face
in
mumming
costumes
,
representing
the
barred
visor
of
*NL*
the
mediaeval
helmet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
fits
pretty
well
,
''
she
said
,
looking
down
at
the
white
overalls
,
*NL*
``
except
that
the
tunic
,
or
whatever
you
call
it
,
is
long
in
the
*NL*
sleeve
.
The
bottom
of
the
overalls
I
can
turn
up
inside
.
Now
pay
*NL*
attention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
then
proceeded
in
her
delivery
,
striking
the
sword
against
*NL*
the
staff
or
lance
at
the
minatory
phrases
,
in
the
orthodox
mumming
*NL*
manner
,
and
strutting
up
and
down
.
Charley
seasoned
his
admiration
*NL*
with
criticism
of
the
gentlest
kind
,
for
the
touch
of
Eustacia
's
hand
*NL*
yet
remained
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
for
your
excuse
to
the
others
,
''
she
said
.
``
Where
do
you
meet
*NL*
before
you
go
to
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought
of
meeting
here
,
miss

if
you
have
nothing
to
say
against
*NL*
it

At
eight
o'clock
,
so
as
to
get
there
by
nine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Well
,
you
of
course
must
not
appear
.
I
will
march
in
about
five
*NL*
minutes
late
,
ready-dressed
,
and
tell
them
that
you
ca
n't
come
.
I
*NL*
have
decided
that
the
best
plan
will
be
for
you
to
be
sent
somewhere
*NL*
by
me
,
to
make
a
real
thing
of
the
excuse
.
Our
two
heath-croppers
are
*NL*
in
the
habit
of
straying
into
the
meads
,
and
tomorrow
evening
you
can
*NL*
go
and
see
if
they
are
gone
there
.
I
'll
manage
the
rest
.
Now
you
may
*NL*
leave
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

But
I
think
I
'll
have
one
minute
more
of
what
I
am
owed

if
you
do
n't
mind

*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
gave
him
her
hand
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
minute
,
''
she
said
,
and
counted
on
till
she
reached
seven
or
eight
*NL*
minutes
.
Hand
and
person
she
then
withdrew
to
a
distance
of
several
*NL*
feet
,
and
recovered
some
of
her
old
dignity
.
The
contract
completed
,
*NL*
she
raised
between
them
a
barrier
impenetrable
as
a
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
't
is
all
gone
;
and
I
did
n't
mean
quite
all

he
said
,
with
a
*NL*
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
good
measure

said
she
,
turning
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Well

't
is
over

now
I
'll
get
home-along

Through

Moonlight

The
next
evening
the
mummers
were
assembled
in
the
same
spot
,
awaiting
*NL*
the
entrance
of
the
Turkish
Knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

On
Egdon
there
was
no
absolute
hour
of
the
day
.
The
time
at
any
*NL*
moment
was
a
number
of
varying
doctrines
professed
by
the
different
*NL*
hamlets
,
some
of
them
having
originally
grown
up
from
a
common
root

and
then
become
divided
by
secession

some
having
been
alien
from

believed
in
Blooms-End
time
,
East
Egdon
in
the
*NL*
time
of
the
Quiet
Woman
Inn
.
Grandfer
Cantle
's
watch
had
numbered
*NL*
many
followers
in
years
gone
by
,
but
since
he
had
grown
older
faiths
*NL*
were
shaken
.
Thus
,
the
mummers
having
gathered
hither
from
scattered
*NL*
points
each
came
with
his
own
tenets
on
early
and
late
;
and
they
*NL*
waited
a
little
longer
as
a
compromise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
had
watched
the
assemblage
through
the
hole
;
and
seeing
that
*NL*
now
was
the
proper
moment
to
enter
,
she
went
from
the
``
linhay
''
and
*NL*
boldly
pulled
the
bobbin
of
the
fuel-house
door
.
Her
grandfather
was
*NL*
safe
at
the
Quiet
Woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
Charley
at
last
!
How
late
you
be
,
Charley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
not
Charley
,
''
said
the
Turkish
Knight
from
within
his
visor
.
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
cousin
of
Miss
Vye
's
,
come
to
take
Charley
's
place
from
*NL*
curiosity
.
He
was
obliged
to
go
and
look
for
the
heath-croppers
that
*NL*
have
got
into
the
meads
,
and
I
agreed
to
take
his
place
,
as
he
knew
he
*NL*
could
n't
come
back
here
again
tonight
.
I
know
the
part
as
well
as
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
graceful
gait
,
elegant
figure
,
and
dignified
manner
in
general
won
*NL*
the
mummers
to
the
opinion
that
they
had
gained
by
the
exchange
,
if
*NL*
the
newcomer
were
perfect
in
his
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
do
n't
matter
--
if
you
be
not
too
young
,
''
said
Saint
George
.
*NL*
Eustacia
's
voice
had
sounded
somewhat
more
juvenile
and
fluty
than
*NL*
Charley
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
every
word
of
it
,
I
tell
you
,
''
said
Eustacia
decisively
.
Dash
*NL*
being
all
that
was
required
to
carry
her
triumphantly
through
,
she
*NL*
adopted
as
much
as
was
necessary
.
``
Go
ahead
,
lads
,
with
the
try-over
.
*NL*
I
'll
challenge
any
of
you
to
find
a
mistake
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
play
was
hastily
rehearsed
,
whereupon
the
other
mummers
were
*NL*
delighted
with
the
new
knight
.
They
extinguished
the
candles
at
*NL*
half-past
eight
,
and
set
out
upon
the
heath
in
the
direction
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Yeobright
's
house
at
Bloom
's
-
End
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
slight
hoar-frost
that
night
,
and
the
moon
,
though
not
*NL*
more
than
half
full
,
threw
a
spirited
and
enticing
brightness
upon
*NL*
the
fantastic
figures
of
the
mumming
band
,
whose
plumes
and
ribbons
*NL*
rustled
in
their
walk
like
autumn
leaves
.
Their
path
was
not
over
*NL*
Rainbarrow
now
,
but
down
a
valley
which
left
that
ancient
elevation
*NL*
a
little
to
the
east
.
The
bottom
of
the
vale
was
green
to
a
width
of
*NL*
ten
yards
or
thereabouts
,
and
the
shining
facets
of
frost
upon
the
*NL*
blades
of
grass
seemed
to
move
on
with
the
shadows
of
those
they
*NL*
surrounded
.
The
masses
of
furze
and
heath
to
the
right
and
left
were
*NL*
dark
as
ever
;
a
mere
half-moon
was
powerless
to
silver
such
sable
*NL*
features
as
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half-an-hour
of
walking
and
talking
brought
them
to
the
spot
in
the
*NL*
valley
where
the
grass
riband
widened
and
led
down
to
the
front
of
*NL*
the
house
.
At
sight
of
the
place
Eustacia
,
who
had
felt
a
few
passing
*NL*
doubts
during
her
walk
with
the
youths
,
again
was
glad
that
the
*NL*
adventure
had
been
undertaken
.
She
had
come
out
to
see
a
man
who
*NL*
might
possibly
have
the
power
to
deliver
her
soul
from
a
most
deadly
*NL*
oppression
.
What
was
Wildeve
?
Interesting
,
but
inadequate
.
Perhaps
*NL*
she
would
see
a
sufficient
hero
tonight
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
drew
nearer
to
the
front
of
the
house
the
mummers
became
aware
*NL*
that
music
and
dancing
were
briskly
flourishing
within
.
Every
now
*NL*
and
then
a
long
low
note
from
the
serpent
,
which
was
the
chief
wind
*NL*
instrument
played
at
these
times
,
advanced
further
into
the
heath
than
*NL*
the
thin
treble
part
,
and
reached
their
ears
alone
;
and
next
a
more
*NL*
than
usually
loud
tread
from
a
dancer
would
come
the
same
way
.
With
*NL*
nearer
approach
these
fragmentary
sounds
became
pieced
together
,
*NL*
and
were
found
to
be
the
salient
points
of
the
tune
called
``
Nancy
's
*NL*
Fancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
there
,
of
course
.
Who
was
she
that
he
danced
with
?
Perhaps
*NL*
some
unknown
woman
,
far
beneath
herself
in
culture
,
was
by
that
most
*NL*
subtle
of
lures
sealing
his
fate
this
very
instant
.
To
dance
with
a
*NL*
man
is
to
concentrate
a
twelve-month
's
regulation
fire
upon
him
in
the
*NL*
fragment
of
an
hour
.
To
pass
to
courtship
without
acquaintance
,
to
*NL*
pass
to
marriage
without
courtship
,
is
a
skipping
of
terms
reserved
*NL*
for
those
alone
who
tread
this
royal
road
.
She
would
see
how
his
heart
*NL*
lay
by
keen
observation
of
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
enterprising
lady
followed
the
mumming
company
through
the
gate
*NL*
in
the
white
paling
,
and
stood
before
the
open
porch
.
The
house
was
*NL*
encrusted
with
heavy
thatchings
,
which
dropped
between
the
upper
*NL*
windows
;
the
front
,
upon
which
the
moonbeams
directly
played
,
had
*NL*
originally
been
white
;
but
a
huge
pyracanth
now
darkened
the
greater
*NL*
portion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
became
at
once
evident
that
the
dance
was
proceeding
immediately
*NL*
within
the
surface
of
the
door
,
no
apartment
intervening
.
The
brushing
*NL*
of
skirts
and
elbows
,
sometimes
the
bumping
of
shoulders
,
could
be
*NL*
heard
against
the
very
panels
.
Eustacia
,
though
living
within
two
*NL*
miles
of
the
place
,
had
never
seen
the
interior
of
this
quaint
old
*NL*
habitation
.
Between
Captain
Vye
and
the
Yeobrights
there
had
never
*NL*
existed
much
acquaintance
,
the
former
having
come
as
a
stranger
and
*NL*
purchased
the
long-empty
house
at
Mistover
Knap
not
long
before
*NL*
the
death
of
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
husband
;
and
with
that
event
and
the
*NL*
departure
of
her
son
such
friendship
as
had
grown
up
became
quite
*NL*
broken
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
no
passage
inside
the
door
,
then
?
''
asked
Eustacia
as
they
*NL*
stood
within
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
lad
who
played
the
Saracen
.
``
The
door
opens
right
upon
*NL*
the
front
sitting-room
,
where
the
spree
's
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
we
can
not
open
the
door
without
stopping
the
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
.
Here
we
must
bide
till
they
have
done
,
for
they
always
*NL*
bolt
the
back
door
after
dark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
be
much
longer
,
''
said
Father
Christmas
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
assertion
,
however
,
was
hardly
borne
out
by
the
event
.
Again
the
*NL*
instruments
ended
the
tune
;
again
they
recommenced
with
as
much
fire
*NL*
and
pathos
as
if
it
were
the
first
strain
.
The
air
was
now
that
one
*NL*
without
any
particular
beginning
,
middle
,
or
end
,
which
perhaps
,
among
*NL*
all
the
dances
which
throng
an
inspired
fiddler
's
fancy
,
best
conveys
*NL*
the
idea
of
the
interminable
--
the
celebrated
``
Devil
's
Dream
.
''
The
*NL*
fury
of
personal
movement
that
was
kindled
by
the
fury
of
the
notes
*NL*
could
be
approximately
imagined
by
these
outsiders
under
the
moon
,
*NL*
from
the
occasional
kicks
of
toes
and
heels
against
the
door
,
whenever
*NL*
the
whirl
round
had
been
of
more
than
customary
velocity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
five
minutes
of
listening
was
interesting
enough
to
the
*NL*
mummers
.
The
five
minutes
extended
to
ten
minutes
,
and
these
to
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
;
but
no
signs
of
ceasing
were
audible
in
the
lively
*NL*
Dream
.
The
bumping
against
the
door
,
the
laughter
,
the
stamping
,
were
*NL*
all
as
vigorous
as
ever
,
and
the
pleasure
in
being
outside
lessened
*NL*
considerably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
Mrs.
Yeobright
give
parties
of
this
sort
?
''
Eustacia
asked
,
*NL*
a
little
surprised
to
hear
merriment
so
pronounced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
one
of
her
bettermost
parlour-parties
.
She
's
asked
the
*NL*
plain
neighbours
and
workpeople
without
drawing
any
lines
,
just
to
*NL*
give
'em
a
good
supper
and
such
like
.
Her
son
and
she
wait
upon
the
*NL*
folks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
the
last
strain
,
I
think
,
''
said
Saint
George
,
with
his
ear
to
*NL*
the
panel
.
``
A
young
man
and
woman
have
just
swung
into
this
corner
,
*NL*
and
he
's
saying
to
her
,
`
Ah
,
the
pity
;
't
is
over
for
us
this
time
,
my
*NL*
own
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
''
said
the
Turkish
Knight
,
stamping
,
and
taking
from
the
*NL*
wall
the
conventional
lance
that
each
of
the
mummers
carried
.
Her
*NL*
boots
being
thinner
than
those
of
the
young
men
,
the
hoar
had
damped
*NL*
her
feet
and
made
them
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
song
't
is
another
ten
minutes
for
us
,
''
said
the
Valiant
*NL*
Soldier
,
looking
through
the
keyhole
as
the
tune
modulated
into
*NL*
another
without
stopping
.
``
Grandfer
Cantle
is
standing
in
this
*NL*
corner
,
waiting
his
turn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Two
n't
be
long
;
't
is
a
six-handed
reel
,
''
said
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
go
in
,
dancing
or
no
?
They
sent
for
us
,
''
said
the
Saracen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
''
said
Eustacia
authoritatively
,
as
she
paced
smartly
*NL*
up
and
down
from
door
to
gate
to
warm
herself
.
``
We
should
burst
into
*NL*
the
middle
of
them
and
stop
the
dance
,
and
that
would
be
unmannerly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks
himself
somebody
because
he
has
had
a
bit
more
schooling
*NL*
than
we
,
''
said
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
go
to
the
deuce
!
''
said
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
whispered
conversation
between
three
or
four
of
them
,
and
*NL*
one
turned
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
tell
us
one
thing
?
''
he
said
,
not
without
gentleness
.
``
Be
*NL*
you
Miss
Vye
?
We
think
you
must
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
think
what
you
like
,
''
said
Eustacia
slowly
.
``
But
honourable
*NL*
lads
will
not
tell
tales
upon
a
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
say
nothing
,
miss
.
That
's
upon
our
honour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
fiddles
finished
off
with
a
screech
,
and
the
*NL*
serpent
emitted
a
last
note
that
nearly
lifted
the
roof
.
When
,
from
*NL*
the
comparative
quiet
within
,
the
mummers
judged
that
the
dancers
had
*NL*
taken
their
seats
,
Father
Christmas
advanced
,
lifted
the
latch
,
and
*NL*
put
his
head
inside
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
mummers
,
the
mummers
!
''
cried
several
guests
at
once
.
``
Clear
*NL*
a
space
for
the
mummers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hump-backed
Father
Christmas
then
made
a
complete
entry
,
swinging
his
*NL*
huge
club
,
and
in
a
general
way
clearing
the
stage
for
the
actors
*NL*
proper
,
while
he
informed
the
company
in
smart
verse
that
he
was
come
,
*NL*
welcome
or
welcome
not
;
concluding
his
speech
with
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
room
,
make
room
,
my
gallant
boys
,
*NL*
And
give
us
space
to
rhyme
;
*NL*
We
've
come
to
show
Saint
George
's
play
,
*NL*
Upon
this
Christmas
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
were
now
arranging
themselves
at
one
end
of
the
room
,
the
*NL*
fiddler
was
mending
a
string
,
the
serpent-player
was
emptying
his
*NL*
mouthpiece
,
and
the
play
began
.
First
of
those
outside
the
Valiant
*NL*
Soldier
entered
,
in
the
interest
of
Saint
George
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
come
I
,
the
Valiant
Soldier
;
*NL*
Slasher
is
my
name
;
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
and
so
on
.
This
speech
concluded
with
a
challenge
to
the
infidel
,
*NL*
at
the
end
of
which
it
was
Eustacia
's
duty
to
enter
as
the
Turkish
*NL*
Knight
.
She
,
with
the
rest
who
were
not
yet
on
,
had
hitherto
remained
*NL*
in
the
moonlight
which
streamed
under
the
porch
.
With
no
apparent
*NL*
effort
or
backwardness
she
came
in
,
beginning
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
come
I
,
a
Turkish
Knight
,
*NL*
Who
learnt
in
Turkish
land
to
fight
;
*NL*
I
'll
fight
this
man
with
courage
bold
:
*NL*
If
his
blood
's
hot
I
'll
make
it
cold
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
During
her
declamation
Eustacia
held
her
head
erect
,
and
spoke
as
*NL*
roughly
as
she
could
,
feeling
pretty
secure
from
observation
.
But
*NL*
the
concentration
upon
her
part
necessary
to
prevent
discovery
,
the
*NL*
newness
of
the
scene
,
the
shine
of
the
candles
,
and
the
confusing
*NL*
effect
upon
her
vision
of
the
ribboned
visor
which
hid
her
features
,
*NL*
left
her
absolutely
unable
to
perceive
who
were
present
as
spectators
.
*NL*
On
the
further
side
of
a
table
bearing
candles
she
could
faintly
*NL*
discern
faces
,
and
that
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Jim
Starks
as
the
Valiant
Soldier
had
come
forward
,
and
,
*NL*
with
a
glare
upon
the
Turk
,
replied
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
,
then
,
thou
art
that
Turkish
Knight
,
*NL*
Draw
out
thy
sword
,
and
let
us
fight
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
fight
they
did
;
the
issue
of
the
combat
being
that
the
Valiant
*NL*
Soldier
was
slain
by
a
preternaturally
inadequate
thrust
from
*NL*
Eustacia
,
Jim
,
in
his
ardour
for
genuine
histrionic
art
,
coming
down
*NL*
like
a
log
upon
the
stone
floor
with
force
enough
to
dislocate
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
Then
,
after
more
words
from
the
Turkish
Knight
,
rather
too
*NL*
faintly
delivered
,
and
statements
that
he
'd
fight
Saint
George
and
*NL*
all
his
crew
,
Saint
George
himself
magnificently
entered
with
the
*NL*
well-known
flourish
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
come
I
,
Saint
George
,
the
valiant
man
,
*NL*
With
naked
sword
and
spear
in
hand
,
*NL*
Who
fought
the
dragon
and
brought
him
to
the
slaughter
,
*NL*
And
by
this
won
fair
Sabra
,
the
King
of
Egypt
's
daughter
;
*NL*
What
mortal
man
would
dare
to
stand
*NL*
Before
me
with
my
sword
in
hand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
lad
who
had
first
recognized
Eustacia
;
and
when
she
now
,
*NL*
as
the
Turk
,
replied
with
suitable
defiance
,
and
at
once
began
the
*NL*
combat
,
the
young
fellow
took
especial
care
to
use
his
sword
as
gently
*NL*
as
possible
.
Being
wounded
,
the
Knight
fell
upon
one
knee
,
according
*NL*
to
the
direction
.
The
Doctor
now
entered
,
restored
the
Knight
by
*NL*
giving
him
a
draught
from
the
bottle
which
he
carried
,
and
the
*NL*
fight
was
again
resumed
,
the
Turk
sinking
by
degrees
until
quite
*NL*
overcome
--
dying
as
hard
in
this
venerable
drama
as
he
is
said
to
do
at
*NL*
the
present
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gradual
sinking
to
the
earth
was
,
in
fact
,
one
reason
why
*NL*
Eustacia
had
thought
that
the
part
of
the
Turkish
Knight
,
though
not
*NL*
the
shortest
,
would
suit
her
best
.
A
direct
fall
from
upright
to
*NL*
horizontal
,
which
was
the
end
of
the
other
fighting
characters
,
was
*NL*
not
an
elegant
or
decorous
part
for
a
girl
.
But
it
was
easy
to
die
*NL*
like
a
Turk
,
by
a
dogged
decline
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
was
now
among
the
number
of
the
slain
,
though
not
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
for
she
had
managed
to
sink
into
a
sloping
position
against
the
*NL*
clock-case
,
so
that
her
head
was
well
elevated
.
The
play
proceeded
*NL*
between
Saint
George
,
the
Saracen
,
the
Doctor
,
and
Father
Christmas
;
*NL*
and
Eustacia
,
having
no
more
to
do
,
for
the
first
time
found
leisure
*NL*
to
observe
the
scene
round
,
and
to
search
for
the
form
that
had
drawn
*NL*
her
hither
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
The
Two
Stand
Face
to
Face
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
had
been
arranged
with
a
view
to
the
dancing
,
the
large
*NL*
oak
table
having
been
moved
back
till
it
stood
as
a
breastwork
to
*NL*
the
fireplace
.
At
each
end
,
behind
,
and
in
the
chimney-corner
were
*NL*
grouped
the
guests
,
many
of
them
being
warm-faced
and
panting
,
among
*NL*
whom
Eustacia
cursorily
recognized
some
well-to-do
persons
from
*NL*
beyond
the
heath
.
Thomasin
,
as
she
had
expected
,
was
not
visible
,
and
*NL*
Eustacia
recollected
that
a
light
had
shone
from
an
upper
window
when
*NL*
they
were
outside
--
the
window
,
probably
,
of
Thomasin
's
room
.
A
nose
,
*NL*
chin
,
hands
,
knees
,
and
toes
projected
from
the
seat
within
the
*NL*
chimney
opening
,
which
members
she
found
to
unite
in
the
person
of
*NL*
Grandfer
Cantle
,
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
occasional
assistant
in
the
garden
,
*NL*
and
therefore
one
of
the
invited
.
The
smoke
went
up
from
an
Etna
of
*NL*
peat
in
front
of
him
,
played
round
the
notches
of
the
chimney-crook
,
*NL*
struck
against
the
saltbox
,
and
got
lost
among
the
flitches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
part
of
the
room
soon
riveted
her
gaze
.
At
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
chimney
stood
the
settle
,
which
is
the
necessary
supplement
to
a
*NL*
fire
so
open
that
nothing
less
than
a
strong
breeze
will
carry
up
the
*NL*
smoke
.
It
is
,
to
the
hearths
of
old-fashioned
cavernous
fireplaces
,
*NL*
what
the
east
belt
of
trees
is
to
the
exposed
country
estate
,
or
the
*NL*
north
wall
to
the
garden
.
Outside
the
settle
candles
gutter
,
locks
*NL*
of
hair
wave
,
young
women
shiver
,
and
old
men
sneeze
.
Inside
is
*NL*
Paradise
.
Not
a
symptom
of
a
draught
disturbs
the
air
;
the
sitters
'
*NL*
backs
are
as
warm
as
their
faces
,
and
songs
and
old
tales
are
drawn
*NL*
from
the
occupants
by
the
comfortable
heat
,
like
fruit
from
melon
*NL*
plants
in
a
frame
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
however
,
not
with
those
who
sat
in
the
settle
that
Eustacia
*NL*
was
concerned
.
A
face
showed
itself
with
marked
distinctness
against
*NL*
the
dark-tanned
wood
of
the
upper
part
.
The
owner
,
who
was
leaning
*NL*
against
the
settle
's
outer
end
,
was
Clement
Yeobright
,
or
Clym
,
as
*NL*
he
was
called
here
;
she
knew
it
could
be
nobody
else
.
The
spectacle
*NL*
constituted
an
area
of
two
feet
in
Rembrandt
's
intensest
manner
.
A
*NL*
strange
power
in
the
lounger
's
appearance
lay
in
the
fact
that
,
though
*NL*
his
whole
figure
was
visible
,
the
observer
's
eye
was
only
aware
of
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
one
of
middle
age
the
countenance
was
that
of
a
young
man
,
though
a
*NL*
youth
might
hardly
have
seen
any
necessity
for
the
term
of
immaturity
.
*NL*
But
it
was
really
one
of
those
faces
which
convey
less
the
idea
of
so
*NL*
many
years
as
its
age
than
of
so
much
experience
as
its
store
.
The
*NL*
number
of
their
years
may
have
adequately
summed
up
Jared
,
Mahalaleel
,
*NL*
and
the
rest
of
the
antediluvians
,
but
the
age
of
a
modern
man
is
to
*NL*
be
measured
by
the
intensity
of
his
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
was
well
shaped
,
even
excellently
.
But
the
mind
within
was
*NL*
beginning
to
use
it
as
a
mere
waste
tablet
whereon
to
trace
its
*NL*
idiosyncrasies
as
they
developed
themselves
.
The
beauty
here
visible
*NL*
would
in
no
long
time
be
ruthlessly
over-run
by
its
parasite
,
thought
,
*NL*
which
might
just
as
well
have
fed
upon
a
plainer
exterior
where
there
*NL*
was
nothing
it
could
harm
.
Had
Heaven
preserved
Yeobright
from
a
*NL*
wearing
habit
of
meditation
,
people
would
have
said
,
``
A
handsome
man
.
''
*NL*
Had
his
brain
unfolded
under
sharper
contours
they
would
have
said
,
``
A
*NL*
thoughtful
man
.
''
But
an
inner
strenuousness
was
preying
upon
an
outer
*NL*
symmetry
,
and
they
rated
his
look
as
singular
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
people
who
began
by
beholding
him
ended
by
perusing
him
.
*NL*
His
countenance
was
overlaid
with
legible
meanings
.
Without
being
*NL*
thought-worn
he
yet
had
certain
marks
derived
from
a
perception
of
his
*NL*
surroundings
,
such
as
are
not
unfrequently
found
on
men
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
four
or
five
years
of
endeavour
which
follow
the
close
of
placid
*NL*
pupilage
.
He
already
showed
that
thought
is
a
disease
of
flesh
,
and
*NL*
indirectly
bore
evidence
that
ideal
physical
beauty
is
incompatible
*NL*
with
emotional
development
and
a
full
recognition
of
the
coil
of
*NL*
things
.
Mental
luminousness
must
be
fed
with
the
oil
of
life
,
even
*NL*
though
there
is
already
a
physical
need
for
it
;
and
the
pitiful
sight
*NL*
of
two
demands
on
one
supply
was
just
showing
itself
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
standing
before
certain
men
the
philosopher
regrets
that
thinkers
*NL*
are
but
perishable
tissue
,
the
artist
that
perishable
tissue
has
to
*NL*
think
.
Thus
to
deplore
,
each
from
his
point
of
view
,
the
mutually
*NL*
destructive
interdependence
of
spirit
and
flesh
would
have
been
*NL*
instinctive
with
these
in
critically
observing
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
his
look
,
it
was
a
natural
cheerfulness
striving
against
*NL*
depression
from
without
,
and
not
quite
succeeding
.
The
look
suggested
*NL*
isolation
,
but
it
revealed
something
more
.
As
is
usual
with
bright
*NL*
natures
,
the
deity
that
lies
ignominiously
chained
within
an
ephemeral
*NL*
human
carcase
shone
out
of
him
like
a
ray
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
upon
Eustacia
was
palpable
.
The
extraordinary
pitch
of
*NL*
excitement
that
she
had
reached
beforehand
would
,
indeed
,
have
caused
*NL*
her
to
be
influenced
by
the
most
commonplace
man
.
She
was
troubled
at
*NL*
Yeobright
's
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
remainder
of
the
play
ended
:
the
Saracen
's
head
was
cut
off
,
and
*NL*
Saint
George
stood
as
victor
.
Nobody
commented
,
any
more
than
they
*NL*
would
have
commented
on
the
fact
of
mushrooms
coming
in
autumn
or
*NL*
snowdrops
in
spring
.
They
took
the
piece
as
phlegmatically
as
did
the
*NL*
actors
themselves
.
It
was
a
phase
of
cheerfulness
which
was
,
as
a
*NL*
matter
of
course
,
to
be
passed
through
every
Christmas
;
and
there
was
*NL*
no
more
to
be
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sang
the
plaintive
chant
which
follows
the
play
,
during
which
all
*NL*
the
dead
men
rise
to
their
feet
in
a
silent
and
awful
manner
,
like
*NL*
the
ghosts
of
Napoleon
's
soldiers
in
the
Midnight
Review
.
Afterwards
*NL*
the
door
opened
,
and
Fairway
appeared
on
the
threshold
,
accompanied
*NL*
by
Christian
and
another
.
They
had
been
waiting
outside
for
the
*NL*
conclusion
of
the
play
,
as
the
players
had
waited
for
the
conclusion
*NL*
of
the
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
come
in
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
;
and
Clym
went
forward
to
*NL*
welcome
them
.
``
How
is
it
you
are
so
late
?
Grandfer
Cantle
has
been
*NL*
here
ever
so
long
,
and
we
thought
you
'd
have
come
with
him
,
as
you
*NL*
live
so
near
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
should
have
come
earlier
,
''
Mr.
Fairway
said
,
and
paused
to
*NL*
look
along
the
beam
of
the
ceiling
for
a
nail
to
hang
his
hat
on
;
but
,
*NL*
finding
his
accustomed
one
to
be
occupied
by
the
mistletoe
,
and
all
*NL*
the
nails
in
the
walls
to
be
burdened
with
bunches
of
holly
,
he
at
*NL*
last
relieved
himself
of
the
hat
by
ticklishly
balancing
it
between
*NL*
the
candlebox
and
the
head
of
the
clock-case
.
``
I
should
have
come
*NL*
earlier
,
ma'am
,
''
he
resumed
,
with
a
more
composed
air
,
``
but
I
know
*NL*
what
parties
be
,
and
how
there
's
none
too
much
room
in
folks
'
houses
*NL*
at
such
times
,
so
I
thought
I
would
n't
come
till
you
'd
got
settled
a
*NL*
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
thought
so
too
,
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
''
said
Christian
earnestly
,
``
but
*NL*
father
there
was
so
eager
that
he
had
no
manners
at
all
,
and
left
home
*NL*
almost
afore
't
was
dark
.
I
told
him
't
was
barely
decent
in
a
'
old
man
*NL*
to
come
so
oversoon
;
but
words
be
wind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Klk
!
I
was
n't
going
to
bide
waiting
about
,
till
half
the
game
was
*NL*
over
!
I
'm
as
light
as
a
kite
when
anything
's
going
on
!
''
crowed
*NL*
Grandfer
Cantle
from
the
chimney-seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fairway
had
meanwhile
concluded
a
critical
gaze
at
Yeobright
.
``
Now
,
*NL*
you
may
not
believe
it
,
''
he
said
to
the
rest
of
the
room
,
``
but
I
*NL*
should
never
have
knowed
this
gentleman
if
I
had
met
him
anywhere
off
*NL*
his
own
he
`
th
--
he
's
altered
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
too
have
altered
,
and
for
the
better
,
I
think
Timothy
,
''
said
*NL*
Yeobright
,
surveying
the
firm
figure
of
Fairway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Yeobright
,
look
me
over
too
.
I
have
altered
for
the
better
,
*NL*
have
n't
I
,
hey
?
''
said
Grandfer
Cantle
,
rising
and
placing
himself
*NL*
something
above
half
a
foot
from
Clym
's
eye
,
to
induce
the
most
*NL*
searching
criticism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
we
will
,
''
said
Fairway
,
taking
the
candle
and
moving
it
*NL*
over
the
surface
of
the
Grandfer
's
countenance
,
the
subject
of
his
*NL*
scrutiny
irradiating
himself
with
light
and
pleasant
smiles
,
and
*NL*
giving
himself
jerks
of
juvenility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
changed
much
,
''
said
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
's
any
difference
,
Grandfer
is
younger
,
''
appended
Fairway
*NL*
decisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
not
my
own
doing
,
and
I
feel
no
pride
in
it
,
''
said
the
*NL*
pleased
ancient
.
``
But
I
ca
n't
be
cured
of
my
vagaries
;
them
I
plead
*NL*
guilty
to
.
Yes
,
Master
Cantle
always
was
that
,
as
we
know
.
But
I
am
*NL*
nothing
by
the
side
of
you
,
Mister
Clym
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
any
o
'
us
,
''
said
Humphrey
,
in
a
low
rich
tone
of
admiration
,
not
*NL*
intended
to
reach
anybody
's
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
there
would
have
been
nobody
here
who
could
have
stood
as
*NL*
decent
second
to
him
,
or
even
third
,
if
I
had
n't
been
a
soldier
in
the
*NL*
Bang-up
Locals
-LRB-
as
we
was
called
for
our
smartness
-RRB-
,
''
said
Grandfer
*NL*
Cantle
.
``
And
even
as
't
is
we
all
look
a
little
scammish
beside
him
.
*NL*
But
in
the
year
four
't
was
said
there
was
n't
a
finer
figure
in
*NL*
the
whole
South
Wessex
than
I
,
as
I
looked
when
dashing
past
the
*NL*
shop-winders
with
the
rest
of
our
company
on
the
day
we
ran
out
o
'
*NL*
Budmouth
because
it
was
thoughted
that
Boney
had
landed
round
the
*NL*
point
.
There
was
I
,
straight
as
a
young
poplar
,
wi
'
my
firelock
,
and
*NL*
my
bag-net
,
and
my
spatter-dashes
,
and
my
stock
sawing
my

off
,
*NL*
and
my
accoutrements
sheening
like
the
seven
stars
!
Yes
,
neighbours
,
*NL*
I
was
a
pretty
sight
in
my
soldiering
days
.
You
ought
to
have
seen
me
*NL*
in
four
!

*NL*

'T
is
his
mother
's
side
where
Master
Clym
's
figure
comes
from

ye

''
said
Timothy
.
``
I
know
'd
her
brothers
well
.
Longer
coffins
were
*NL*
never
made
in
the
whole
country
of
South
Wessex
,
and
't
is
said
that
*NL*
poor
George

knees
were
crumpled
up
a
little
e

en
as
't
was

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coffins
,
where
?
''
inquired
Christian
,
drawing
nearer
.
``
Have
the
ghost
*NL*
of
one
appeared
to
anybody
,
Master
Fairway
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no

Do
n't
let
your
mind
so
mislead
your
ears

Christian
;
and
be
*NL*
a
man
,
''
said
Timothy
reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
.
''
said
Christian
.
``
But
now
I
think
o
'
t
my
shadder
last
night
*NL*
seemed
just
the
shape
of
a
coffin
.
What
is
it
a
sign
of
when
your
*NL*
shade
's
like
a
coffin
,
neighbours
?
It
ca
n't
be
nothing
to
be
afeared
*NL*
of
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afeared
,
no
!
''
said
the
Grandfer
.
``
Faith
,
I
was
never
afeard
of
*NL*
nothing

Boney

I
should
n't
ha

been
the
soldier
I
was

Yes
,
*NL*
't
is
a
thousand
pities
you
did
n't
see
me
in
four
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
mummers
were
preparing
to
leave
;
but
Mrs.
Yeobright
*NL*
stopped
them
by
asking
them
to
sit
down
and
have
a
little
supper
.
To
*NL*
this
invitation
Father
Christmas
,
in
the
name
of
them
all
,
readily
*NL*
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
was
happy
in
the
opportunity
of
staying
a
little
longer
.
*NL*
The
cold
and
frosty
night
without
was
doubly
frigid
to
her
.
But
the
*NL*
lingering
was
not
without
its
difficulties
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
for
want
*NL*
of
room
in
the
larger
apartment
,
placed
a
bench
for
the
mummers
*NL*
half-way
through
the
pantry
door
,
which
opened
from
the
sitting-room
.
*NL*
Here
they
seated
themselves
in
a
row
,
the
door
being
left
open
:
thus
*NL*
they
were
still
virtually
in
the
same
apartment
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
*NL*
now
murmured
a
few
words
to
her
son
,
who
crossed
the
room
to
the
*NL*
pantry-door
,
striking
his
head
against
the
mistletoe
as
he
passed
,
and
*NL*
brought
the
mummers
beef
and
bread
,
cake
pastry
,
mead
,
and
elder-wine
,
*NL*
the
waiting
being
done
by
him
and
his
mother
,
that
the
little
*NL*
maid-servant
might
sit
as
guest
.
The
mummers
doffed
their
helmets
,
*NL*
and
began
to
eat
and
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
surely
have
some
?
''
said
Clym
to
the
Turkish
Knight
,
*NL*
as
he
stood
before
that
warrior
,
tray
in
hand
.
She
had
refused
,
and
*NL*
still
sat
covered
,
only
the
sparkle
of
her
eyes
being
visible
between
*NL*
the
ribbons
which
covered
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
,
thank
you
,
''
replied
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
quite
a
youngster
,
''
said
the
Saracen
apologetically
,
``
and
you
*NL*
must
excuse
him
.
He
's
not
one
of
the
old
set
,
but
have
jined
us
*NL*
because
t
`
other
could
n't
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
will
take
something
?
''
persisted
Yeobright
.
``
Try
a
glass
of
*NL*
mead
or
elder-wine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
had
better
try
that
,
''
said
the
Saracen
.
``
It
will
keep
the
*NL*
cold
out
going
home-along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Eustacia
could
not
eat
without
uncovering
her
face
she
*NL*
could
drink
easily
enough
beneath
her
disguise
.
The
elder-wine
was
*NL*
accordingly
accepted
,
and
the
glass
vanished
inside
the
ribbons
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
moments
during
this
performance
Eustacia
was
half
in
doubt
about
*NL*
the
security
of
her
position
;
yet
it
had
a
fearful
joy
.
A
series
of
*NL*
attentions
paid
to
her
,
and
yet
not
to
her
but
to
some
imaginary
*NL*
person
,
by
the
first
man
she
had
ever
been
inclined
to
adore
,
*NL*
complicated
her
emotions
indescribably
.
She
had
loved
him
partly
*NL*
because
he
was
exceptional
in
this
scene
,
partly
because
she
had
*NL*
determined
to
love
him
,
chiefly
because
she
was
in
desperate
need
of
*NL*
loving
somebody
after
wearying
of
Wildeve
.
Believing
that
she
must
*NL*
love
him
in
spite
of
herself
,
she
had
been
influenced
after
the
*NL*
fashion
of
the
second
Lord
Lyttleton
and
other
persons
,
who
have
*NL*
dreamed
that
they
were
to
die
on
a
certain
day
,
and
by
stress
of
a
*NL*
morbid
imagination
have
actually
brought
about
that
event
.
Once
let
*NL*
a
maiden
admit
the
possibility
of
her
being
stricken
with
love
for
*NL*
some
one
at
a
certain
hour
and
place
,
and
the
thing
is
as
good
as
*NL*
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
anything
at
this
moment
suggest
to
Yeobright
the
sex
of
the
*NL*
creature
whom
that
fantastic
guise
inclosed
,
how
extended
was
her
*NL*
scope
both
in
feeling
and
in
making
others
feel
,
and
how
far
her
*NL*
compass
transcended
that
of
her
companions
in
the
band
?
When
the
*NL*
disguised
Queen
of
Love
appeared
before
Aeneas
a
preternatural
*NL*
perfume
accompanied
her
presence
and
betrayed
her
quality
.
If
such
a
*NL*
mysterious
emanation
ever
was
projected
by
the
emotions
of
an
earthly
*NL*
woman
upon
their
object
,
it
must
have
signified
Eustacia
's
presence
to
*NL*
Yeobright
now
.
He
looked
at
her
wistfully
,
then
seemed
to
fall
into
*NL*
a
reverie
,
as
if
he
were
forgetting
what
he
observed
.
The
momentary
*NL*
situation
ended
,
he
passed
on
,
and
Eustacia
sipped
her
wine
without
*NL*
knowing
what
she
drank
.
The
man
for
whom
she
had
predetermined
to
*NL*
nourish
a
passion
went
into
the
small
room
,
and
across
it
to
the
*NL*
further
extremity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mummers
,
as
has
been
stated
,
were
seated
on
a
bench
,
one
end
of
*NL*
which
extended
into
the
small
apartment
,
or
pantry
,
for
want
of
space
*NL*
in
the
outer
room
.
Eustacia
,
partly
from
shyness
,
had
chosen
the
*NL*
midmost
seat
,
which
thus
commanded
a
view
of
the
interior
of
the
*NL*
pantry
as
well
as
the
room
containing
the
guests
.
When
Clym
passed
*NL*
down
the
pantry
her
eyes
followed
him
in
the
gloom
which
prevailed
*NL*
there
.
At
the
remote
end
was
a
door
which
,
just
as
he
was
about
to
*NL*
open
it
for
himself
,
was
opened
by
somebody
within
;
and
light
streamed
*NL*
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
person
was
Thomasin
,
with
a
candle
,
looking
anxious
,
pale
,
and
*NL*
interesting
.
Yeobright
appeared
glad
to
see
her
,
and
pressed
her
*NL*
hand
.
``
That
's
right
,
Tamsie
,
''
he
said
heartily
,
as
though
recalled
*NL*
to
himself
by
the
sight
of
her
,
``
you
have
decided
to
come
down
.
I
am
*NL*
glad
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
--
no
,
no
,
''
she
said
quickly
.
``
I
only
came
to
speak
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
not
join
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
.
At
least
I
would
rather
not
.
I
am
not
well
enough
,
and
we
*NL*
shall
have
plenty
of
time
together
now
you
are
going
to
be
home
a
good
*NL*
long
holiday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
nearly
so
pleasant
without
you
.
Are
you
really
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
little
,
my
old
cousin
--
here
,
''
she
said
,
playfully
sweeping
her
*NL*
hand
across
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
mother
should
have
asked
somebody
else
to
be
present
tonight
,
*NL*
perhaps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
indeed
.
I
merely
stepped
down
,
Clym
,
to
ask
you
--
''
Here
he
*NL*
followed
her
through
the
doorway
into
the
private
room
beyond
,
and
,
*NL*
the
door
closing
,
Eustacia
and
the
mummer
who
sat
next
to
her
,
the
*NL*
only
other
witness
of
the
performance
,
saw
and
heard
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heat
flew
to
Eustacia
's
head
and
cheeks
.
She
instantly
guessed
*NL*
that
Clym
,
having
been
home
only
these
two
or
three
days
,
had
not
as
*NL*
yet
been
made
acquainted
with
Thomasin
's
painful
situation
with
regard
*NL*
to
Wildeve
;
and
seeing
her
living
there
just
as
she
had
been
living
*NL*
before
he
left
home
,
he
naturally
suspected
nothing
.
Eustacia
felt
*NL*
a
wild
jealousy
of
Thomasin
on
the
instant
.
Though
Thomasin
might
*NL*
possibly
have
tender
sentiments
towards
another
man
as
yet
,
how
long
*NL*
could
they
be
expected
to
last
when
she
was
shut
up
here
with
this
*NL*
interesting
and
travelled
cousin
of
hers
?
There
was
no
knowing
what
*NL*
affection
might
not
soon
break
out
between
the
two
,
so
constantly
*NL*
in
each
other
's
society
,
and
not
a
distracting
object
near
.
Clym
's
*NL*
boyish
love
for
her
might
have
languished
,
but
it
might
easily
be
*NL*
revived
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
was
nettled
by
her
own
contrivances
.
What
a
sheer
waste
of
*NL*
herself
to
be
dressed
thus
while
another
was
shining
to
advantage
!
Had
*NL*
she
known
the
full
effect
of
the
encounter
she
would
have
moved
heaven
*NL*
and
earth
to
get
here
in
a
natural
manner
.
The
power
of
her
face
all
*NL*
lost
,
the
charm
of
her
emotions
all
disguised
,
the
fascinations
of
her
*NL*
coquetry
denied
existence
,
nothing
but
a
voice
left
to
her
;
she
had
a
*NL*
sense
of
the
doom
of
Echo
.
``
Nobody
here
respects
me
,
''
she
said
.
She
*NL*
had
overlooked
the
fact
that
,
in
coming
as
a
boy
among
other
boys
,
she
*NL*
would
be
treated
as
a
boy
.
The
slight
,
though
of
her
own
causing
,
and
*NL*
self-explanatory
,
she
was
unable
to
dismiss
as
unwittingly
shown
,
so
*NL*
sensitive
had
the
situation
made
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Women
have
done
much
for
themselves
in
histrionic
dress
.
To
look
far
*NL*
below
those
who
,
like
a
certain
fair
personator
of
Polly
Peachum
early
*NL*
in
the
last
century
,
and
another
of
Lydia
Languish
early
in
this
,
have
*NL*
won
not
only
love
but
ducal
coronets
into
the
bargain
,
whole
shoals
of
*NL*
them
have
reached
to
the
initial
satisfaction
of
getting
love
almost
*NL*
whence
they
would
.
But
the
Turkish
Knight
was
denied
even
the
chance
*NL*
of
achieving
this
by
the
fluttering
ribbons
which
she
dared
not
brush
*NL*
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
returned
to
the
room
without
his
cousin
.
When
within
two
or
*NL*
three
feet
of
Eustacia
he
stopped
,
as
if
again
arrested
by
a
thought
.
*NL*
He
was
gazing
at
her
.
She
looked
another
way
,
disconcerted
,
and
*NL*
wondered
how
long
this
purgatory
was
to
last
.
After
lingering
a
few
*NL*
seconds
he
passed
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
court
their
own
discomfiture
by
love
is
a
common
instinct
with
*NL*
certain
perfervid
women
.
Conflicting
sensations
of
love
,
fear
,
and
*NL*
shame
reduced
Eustacia
to
a
state
of
the
utmost
uneasiness
.
To
escape
*NL*
was
her
great
and
immediate
desire
.
The
other
mummers
appeared
to
be
*NL*
in
no
hurry
to
leave
;
and
murmuring
to
the
lad
who
sat
next
to
her
*NL*
that
she
preferred
waiting
for
them
outside
the
house
,
she
moved
to
*NL*
the
door
as
imperceptibly
as
possible
,
opened
it
,
and
slipped
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
calm
,
lone
scene
reassured
her
.
She
went
forward
to
the
palings
*NL*
and
leant
over
them
,
looking
at
the
moon
.
She
had
stood
thus
but
a
*NL*
little
time
when
the
door
again
opened
.
Expecting
to
see
the
remainder
*NL*
of
the
band
Eustacia
turned
;
but
no
--
Clym
Yeobright
came
out
as
softly
*NL*
as
she
had
done
,
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
advanced
and
stood
beside
her
.
``
I
have
an
odd
opinion
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
and
should
like
to
ask
you
a
question
.
Are
you
a
woman
--
or
am
I
*NL*
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
lingered
on
her
with
great
interest
.
``
Do
girls
often
play
as
*NL*
mummers
now
?
They
never
used
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
get
excitement
and
shake
off
depression
,
''
she
said
in
low
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
depressed
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
cause
of
depression
a
good
many
have
to
put
up
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
silence
.
``
And
do
you
find
excitement
?
''
asked
Clym
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
moment
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
vexed
at
being
discovered
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
though
I
thought
I
might
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
gladly
have
asked
you
to
our
party
had
I
known
you
wished
to
*NL*
come
.
Have
I
ever
been
acquainted
with
you
in
my
youth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
in
again
,
and
stay
as
long
as
you
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
wish
not
to
be
further
recognized
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
are
safe
with
me
.
''
After
remaining
in
thought
a
minute
he
*NL*
added
gently
,
``
I
will
not
intrude
upon
you
longer
.
It
is
a
strange
*NL*
way
of
meeting
,
and
I
will
not
ask
why
I
find
a
cultivated
woman
*NL*
playing
such
a
part
as
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
volunteer
the
reason
which
he
seemed
to
hope
for
,
and
*NL*
he
wished
her
good
night
,
going
thence
round
to
the
back
of
the
*NL*
house
,
where
he
walked
up
and
down
by
himself
for
some
time
before
*NL*
re-entering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
,
warmed
with
an
inner
fire
,
could
not
wait
for
her
companions
*NL*
after
this
.
She
flung
back
the
ribbons
from
her
face
,
opened
the
*NL*
gate
,
and
at
once
struck
into
the
heath
.
She
did
not
hasten
along
.
*NL*
Her
grandfather
was
in
bed
at
this
hour
,
for
she
so
frequently
walked
*NL*
upon
the
hills
on
moonlight
nights
that
he
took
no
notice
of
her
*NL*
comings
and
goings
,
and
,
enjoying
himself
in
his
own
way
,
left
her
to
*NL*
do
likewise
.
A
more
important
subject
than
that
of
getting
indoors
*NL*
now
engrossed
her
.
Yeobright
,
if
he
had
the
least
curiosity
,
would
*NL*
infallibly
discover
her
name
.
What
then
?
She
first
felt
a
sort
of
*NL*
exultation
at
the
way
in
which
the
adventure
had
terminated
,
even
*NL*
though
at
moments
between
her
exultations
she
was
abashed
and
*NL*
blushful
.
Then
this
consideration
recurred
to
chill
her
:
What
was
*NL*
the
use
of
her
exploit
?
She
was
at
present
a
total
stranger
to
the
*NL*
Yeobright
family
.
The
unreasonable
nimbus
of
romance
with
which
she
*NL*
had
encircled
that
man
might
be
her
misery
.
How
could
she
allow
*NL*
herself
to
become
so
infatuated
with
a
stranger
?
And
to
fill
the
*NL*
cup
of
her
sorrow
there
would
be
Thomasin
,
living
day
after
day
in
*NL*
inflammable
proximity
to
him
;
for
she
had
just
learnt
that
,
contrary
*NL*
to
her
first
belief
,
he
was
going
to
stay
at
home
some
considerable
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
reached
the
wicket
at
Mistover
Knap
,
but
before
opening
it
she
*NL*
turned
and
faced
the
heath
once
more
.
The
form
of
Rainbarrow
stood
*NL*
above
the
hills
,
and
the
moon
stood
above
Rainbarrow
.
The
air
was
*NL*
charged
with
silence
and
frost
.
The
scene
reminded
Eustacia
of
a
*NL*
circumstance
which
till
that
moment
she
had
totally
forgotten
.
She
*NL*
had
promised
to
meet
Wildeve
by
the
Barrow
this
very
night
at
eight
,
*NL*
to
give
a
final
answer
to
his
pleading
for
an
elopement
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
herself
had
fixed
the
evening
and
the
hour
.
He
had
probably
come
*NL*
to
the
spot
,
waited
there
in
the
cold
,
and
been
greatly
disappointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
so
much
the
better
:
it
did
not
hurt
him
,
''
she
said
serenely
.
*NL*
Wildeve
had
at
present
the
rayless
outline
of
the
sun
through
smoked
*NL*
glass
,
and
she
could
say
such
things
as
that
with
the
greatest
*NL*
facility
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
deeply
pondering
;
and
Thomasin
's
winning
manner
towards
*NL*
her
cousin
arose
again
upon
Eustacia
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
that
she
had
been
married
to
Damon
before
this
!
''
she
said
.
``
And
*NL*
she
would
if
it
had
n't
been
for
me
!
If
I
had
only
known
--
if
I
had
only
*NL*
known
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
once
more
lifted
her
deep
stormy
eyes
to
the
moonlight
,
and
,
*NL*
sighing
that
tragic
sigh
of
hers
which
was
so
much
like
a
shudder
,
*NL*
entered
the
shadow
of
the
roof
.
She
threw
off
her
trappings
in
the
*NL*
out-house
,
rolled
them
up
,
and
went
indoors
to
her
chamber
.

A

and
Oddness
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
captain
's
prevailing
indifference
to
his
granddaughter
's
*NL*
movements
left
her
free
as
a
bird
to
follow
her
own
courses
;
but
it
so
*NL*
happened
that
he
did
take
upon
himself
the
next
morning
to
ask
her
why
*NL*
she
had
walked
out
so
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
in
search
of
events
,
grandfather
,
''
she
said
,
looking
out
of
the
*NL*
window
with
that
drowsy
latency
of
manner
which
discovered
so
much
*NL*
force
behind
it
whenever
the
trigger
was
pressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Search
of
events
--
one
would
think
you
were
one
of
the
bucks
I
knew
at
*NL*
one-and-twenty

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
lonely
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
.
If
I
were
living
in
a
town
my
whole

would
*NL*
be
taken
up

looking
after
you

I
fully
expected
you
would
have
*NL*
been
home
when
I
returned
from
the
Woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
conceal
what
I
did

I
wanted
an
adventure

and
I
went

Knight

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

did

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
first
performance
,
and
it
certainly
will
be
my
last

Now
I
*NL*
have
told
you

and
remember
it
is
a
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course

*NL*
have
pleased

forty
years
ago

But
remember

no
more

my
girl
.
*NL*
You
may
walk
on
the
heath
night
or
day
,
as
you

so
that
you
*NL*
do
n't
bother
me
;
but
no
figuring
in
breeches
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
have
no
fear
for
me
,
grandpapa

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
conversation
ceased
,
Eustacia
's
moral
training
never
*NL*
exceeding
in
severity
a
dialogue
of
this
sort
,
which
,
if
it
ever
*NL*
became
profitable
to
good
works
,
would
be
a
result
not
dear
at
the
*NL*
price
.
But
her
thoughts
soon
strayed
far
from
her
own
personality
;
*NL*
and
,
full
of
a
passionate
and
indescribable
solicitude
for
one
to
whom
*NL*
she
was
not
even
a
name
,
she
went
forth
into
the
amplitude
of
tanned
*NL*
wild
around
her
,
restless
as
Ahasuerus
the
Jew
.
She
was
about
half
a
*NL*
mile
from
her
residence
when
she
beheld
a
sinister
redness
arising
*NL*
from
a
ravine
a
little
way
in
advance
--
dull
and
lurid
like
a
flame
in
*NL*
sunlight
and
she
guessed
it
to
signify
Diggory
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
farmers
who
had
wished
to
buy
in
a
new
stock
of
reddle
*NL*
during
the
last
month
had
inquired
where
Venn
was
to
be
found
,
people
*NL*
replied
,
``
On
Egdon
Heath
.
''
Day
after
day
the
answer
was
the
same
.
*NL*
Now
,
since
Egdon
was
populated
with
heath-croppers
and
furze-cutters
*NL*
rather
than
with
sheep
and
shepherds
,
and
the
downs
where
most
of
the
*NL*
latter
were
to
be
found
lay
some
to
the
north
,
some
to
the
west
of
*NL*
Egdon
,
his
reason
for
camping
about
there
like
Israel
in
Zin
was
not
*NL*
apparent
.
The
position
was
central
and
occasionally
desirable
.
But
*NL*
the
sale
of
reddle
was
not
Diggory
's
primary
object
in
remaining
on
*NL*
the
heath
,
particularly
at
so
late
a
period
of
the
year
,
when
most
*NL*
travellers
of
his
class
had
gone
into
winter
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
looked
at
the
lonely
man
.
Wildeve
had
told
her
at
their
last
*NL*
meeting
that
Venn
had
been
thrust
forward
by
Mrs.
Yeobright
as
one
*NL*
ready
and
anxious
to
take
his
place
as
Thomasin
's
betrothed
.
His
*NL*
figure
was
perfect
,
his
face
young
and
well
outlined
,
his
eyes
bright
,
*NL*
his
intelligence
keen
,
and
his
position
one
which
he
could
readily
*NL*
better
if
he
chose
.
But
in
spite
of
possibilities
it
was
not
likely
*NL*
that
Thomasin
would
accept
this
Ishmaelitish
creature
while
she
had
a
*NL*
cousin
like
Yeobright
at
her
elbow
,
and
Wildeve
at
the
same
time
not
*NL*
absolutely
indifferent
.
Eustacia
was
not
long
in
guessing
that
poor
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
in
her
anxiety
for
her
niece
's
future
,
had
mentioned
*NL*
this
lover
to
stimulate
the
zeal
of
the
other
.
Eustacia
was
on
the
*NL*
side
of
the
Yeobrights
now
,
and
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
aunt
's
*NL*
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
miss
,
''
said
the
reddleman
,
taking
off
his
cap
of
*NL*
hareskin
,
and
apparently
bearing
her
no
ill-will
from
recollection
of
*NL*
their
last
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
reddleman
,
''
she
said
,
hardly
troubling
to
lift
her
*NL*
heavily
shaded
eyes
to
his
.
``
I
did
not
know
you
were
so
near
.
Is
*NL*
your
van
here
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
moved
his
elbow
towards
a
hollow
in
which
a
dense
brake
of
*NL*
purple-stemmed
brambles
had
grown
to
such
vast
dimensions
as
almost
*NL*
to
form
a
dell
.
Brambles
,
though
churlish
when
handled
,
are
kindly
*NL*
shelter
in
early
winter
,
being
the
latest
of
the
deciduous
bushes
*NL*
to
lose
their
leaves
.
The
roof
and
chimney
of
Venn
's
caravan
showed
*NL*
behind
the
tracery
and
tangles
of
the
brake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remain
near
this
part
?
''
she
asked
with
more
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
business
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
altogether
the
selling
of
reddle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
to
do
with
Miss
Yeobright
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
seemed
to
ask
for
an
armed
peace
,
and
he
therefore
said
*NL*
frankly
,
``
Yes
,
miss
;
it
is
on
account
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
account
of
your
approaching
marriage
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
flushed
through
his
stain
.
``
Do
n't
make
sport
of
me
,
Miss
Vye
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
thus
convinced
that
the
reddleman
was
a
mere
_
pis
aller
_
in
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
mind
;
one
,
moreover
,
who
had
not
even
been
informed
*NL*
of
his
promotion
to
that
lowly
standing
.
``
It
was
a
mere
notion
of
*NL*
mine
,
''
she
said
quietly
;
and
was
about
to
pass
by
without
further
*NL*
speech
,
when
,
looking
round
to
the
right
,
she
saw
a
painfully
*NL*
well-known
figure
serpentining
upwards
by
one
of
the
little
paths
*NL*
which
led
to
the
top
where
she
stood
.
Owing
to
the
necessary
windings
*NL*
of
his
course
his
back
was
at
present
towards
them
.
She
glanced
*NL*
quickly
round
;
to
escape
that
man
there
was
only
one
way
.
Turning
to
*NL*
Venn
,
she
said
,
``
Would
you
allow
me
to
rest
a
few
minutes
in
your
van
?
*NL*
The
banks
are
damp
for
sitting
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
miss
;
I
'll
make
a
place
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
him
behind
the
dell
of
brambles
to
his
wheeled
dwelling
,
*NL*
into
which
Venn
mounted
,
placing
the
three-legged
stool
just
within
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
best
I
can
do
for
you
,
''
he
said
,
stepping
down
and
*NL*
retiring
to
the
path
,
where
he
resumed
the
smoking
of
his
pipe
as
he
*NL*
walked
up
and
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
bounded
into
the
vehicle
and
sat
on
the
stool
,
ensconced
from
*NL*
view
on
the
side
towards
the
trackway
.
Soon
she
heard
the
brushing
*NL*
of
other
feet
than
the
reddleman
's
,
a
not
very
friendly
``
Good
day
''
*NL*
uttered
by
two
men
in
passing
each
other
,
and
then
the
dwindling
*NL*
of
the
footfall
of
one
of
them
in
a
direction
onwards
.
Eustacia
*NL*
stretched
her
neck
forward
till
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
receding
*NL*
back
and
shoulders
;
and
she
felt
a
wretched
twinge
of
misery
,
she
knew
*NL*
not
why
.
It
was
the
sickening
feeling
which
,
if
the
changed
heart
has
*NL*
any
generosity
at
all
in
its
composition
,
accompanies
the
sudden
sight
*NL*
of
a
once-loved
one
who
is
beloved
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Eustacia
descended
to
proceed
on
her
way
the
reddleman
came
near
.
*NL*
``
That
was
Mr.
Wildeve
who
passed
,
miss
,
''
he
said
slowly
,
and
expressed
*NL*
by
his
face
that
he
expected
her
to
feel
vexed
at
having
been
sitting
*NL*
unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
saw
him
coming
up
the
hill
,
''
replied
Eustacia
.
``
Why
should
you
*NL*
tell
me
that
?
''
It
was
a
bold
question
,
considering
the
reddleman
's
*NL*
knowledge
of
her
past
love
;
but
her
undemonstrative
manner
had
power
*NL*
to
repress
the
opinions
of
those
she
treated
as
remote
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
can
ask
it
,
''
said
the
reddleman
bluntly
.
*NL*
``
And
,
now
I
think
of
it
,
it
agrees
with
what
I
saw
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
what
was
that
?
''
Eustacia
wished
to
leave
him
,
but
wished
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wildeve
stayed
at
Rainbarrow
a
long
time
waiting
for
a
lady
who
*NL*
did
n't
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
waited
too
,
it
seems
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
always
do
.
I
was
glad
to
see
him
disappointed
.
He
will
be
*NL*
there
again
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
again
disappointed
.
The
truth
is
,
reddleman
,
that
that
lady
,
*NL*
so
far
from
wishing
to
stand
in
the
way
of
Thomasin
's
marriage
with
*NL*
Mr.
Wildeve
,
would
be
very
glad
to
promote
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
felt
much
astonishment
at
this
avowal
,
though
he
did
not
show
it
*NL*
clearly
;
that
exhibition
may
greet
remarks
which
are
one
remove
from
*NL*
expectation
,
but
it
is
usually
withheld
in
complicated
cases
of
two
*NL*
removes
and
upwards
.
``
Indeed
,
miss
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
that
Mr.
Wildeve
will
come
to
Rainbarrow
again
*NL*
tonight
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
him
say
to
himself
that
he
would
.
He
's
in
a
regular
temper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
looked
for
a
moment
what
she
felt
,
and
she
murmured
,
lifting
*NL*
her
deep
dark
eyes
anxiously
to
his
,
``
I
wish
I
knew
what
to
do
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
be
uncivil
to
him
;
but
I
do
n't
wish
to
see
him
again
;
*NL*
and
I
have
some
few
little
things
to
return
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
choose
to
send
'em
by
me
,
miss
,
and
a
note
to
tell
him
that
*NL*
you
wish
to
say
no
more
to
him
,
I
'll
take
it
for
you
quite
privately
.
*NL*
That
would
be
the
most
straightforward
way
of
letting
him
know
your
*NL*
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Eustacia
.
``
Come
towards
my
house
,
and
I
will
bring
*NL*
it
out
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
,
and
as
the
path
was
an
infinitely
small
parting
in
the
*NL*
shaggy
locks
of
the
heath
,
the
reddleman
followed
exactly
in
her
*NL*
trail
.
She
saw
from
a
distance
that
the
captain
was
on
the
bank
*NL*
sweeping
the
horizon
with
his
telescope
;
and
bidding
Venn
to
wait
*NL*
where
he
stood
she
entered
the
house
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
ten
minutes
she
returned
with
a
parcel
and
a
note
,
and
said
,
in
*NL*
placing
them
in
his
hand
,
``
Why
are
you
so
ready
to
take
these
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
ask
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
think
to
serve
Thomasin
in
some
way
by
it
.
Are
you
as
*NL*
anxious
as
ever
to
help
on
her
marriage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
was
a
little
moved
.
``
I
would
sooner
have
married
her
myself
,
''
he
*NL*
said
in
a
low
voice
.
``
But
what
I
feel
is
that
if
she
can
not
be
happy
*NL*
without
him
I
will
do
my
duty
in
helping
her
to
get
him
,
as
a
man
*NL*
ought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
looked
curiously
at
the
singular
man
who
spoke
thus
.
What
*NL*
a
strange
sort
of
love
,
to
be
entirely
free
from
that
quality
of
*NL*
selfishness
which
is
frequently
the
chief
constituent
of
the
passion
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
its
only
one
!
The
reddleman
's
disinterestedness
was
so
*NL*
well
deserving
of
respect
that
it
overshot
respect
by
being
barely
*NL*
comprehended
;
and
she
almost
thought
it
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
are
both
of
one
mind
at
last
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Venn
gloomily
.
``
But
if
you
would
tell
me
,
miss
,
why
*NL*
you
take
such
an
interest
in
her
,
I
should
be
easier
.
It
is
so
sudden
*NL*
and
strange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
appeared
at
a
loss
.
``
I
can
not
tell
you
that
,
reddleman
,
''
she
*NL*
said
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
said
no
more
.
He
pocketed
the
letter
,
and
,
bowing
to
Eustacia
,
*NL*
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rainbarrow
had
again
become
blended
with
night
when
Wildeve
ascended
*NL*
the
long
acclivity
at
its
base
.
On
his
reaching
the
top
a
shape
grew
*NL*
up
from
the
earth
immediately
behind
him
.
It
was
that
of
Eustacia
's
*NL*
emissary
.
He
slapped
Wildeve
on
the
shoulder
.
The
feverish
young
*NL*
innkeeper
and
ex-engineer
started
like
Satan
at
the
touch
of
*NL*
Ithuriel
's
spear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
meeting
is
always
at
eight
o'clock
,
at
this
place
,
''
said
Venn
,
*NL*
``
and
here
we
are
--
we
three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
three
?
''
said
Wildeve
,
looking
quickly
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
you
,
and
I
,
and
she
.
This
is
she
.
''
He
held
up
the
letter
and
*NL*
parcel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
took
them
wonderingly
.
``
I
do
n't
quite
see
what
this
means
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
How
do
you
come
here
?
There
must
be
some
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
cleared
from
your
mind
when
you
have
read
the
letter
.
*NL*
Lanterns
for
one
.
''
The
reddleman
struck
a
light
,
kindled
an
inch
of
*NL*
tallow-candle
which
he
had
brought
,
and
sheltered
it
with
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
said
Wildeve
,
discerning
by
the
candlelight
an
*NL*
obscure
rubicundity
of
person
in
his
companion
.
``
You
are
the
*NL*
reddleman
I
saw
on
the
hill
this
morning
--
why
,
you
are
the
man
*NL*
who
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
read
the
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
come
from
the
other
one
I
should
n't
have
been
surprised
,
''
*NL*
murmured
Wildeve
as
he
opened
the
letter
and
read
.
His
face
grew
*NL*
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
TO
MR.
WILDEVE
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
thought
I
have
decided
once
and
for
all
that
we
*NL*
must
hold
no
further
communication
.
The
more
I
consider
the
*NL*
matter
the
more
I
am
convinced
that
there
must
be
an
end
*NL*
to
our
acquaintance
.
Had
you
been
uniformly
faithful
to
me
*NL*
throughout
these
two
years
you
might
now
have
some
ground
*NL*
for
accusing
me
of
heartlessness
;
but
if
you
calmly
consider
*NL*
what
I
bore
during
the
period
of
your
desertion
,
and
how
I
*NL*
passively
put
up
with
your
courtship
of
another
without
once
*NL*
interfering
,
you
will
,
I
think
,
own
that
I
have
a
right
to
*NL*
consult
my
own
feelings
when
you
come
back
to
me
again
.
That
*NL*
these
are
not
what
they
were
towards
you
may
,
perhaps
,
be
a
*NL*
fault
in
me
,
but
it
is
one
which
you
can
scarcely
reproach
*NL*
me
for
when
you
remember
how
you
left
me
for
Thomasin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
articles
you
gave
me
in
the
early
part
of
our
*NL*
friendship
are
returned
by
the
bearer
of
this
letter
.
They
*NL*
should
rightly
have
been
sent
back
when
I
first
heard
of
*NL*
your
engagement
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
EUSTACIA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
that
Wildeve
reached
her
name
the
blankness
with
which
he
*NL*
had
read
the
first
half
of
the
letter
intensified
to
mortification
.
*NL*
``
I
am
made
a
great
fool
of
,
one
way
and
another
,
''
he
said
pettishly
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
is
in
this
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
hummed
a
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
answer
me
?
''
asked
Wildeve
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ru-um-tum-tum
,
''
sang
the
reddleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
stood
looking
on
the
ground
beside
Venn
's
feet
,
till
he
*NL*
allowed
his
eyes
to
travel
upwards
over
Diggory
's
form
,
as
illuminated
*NL*
by
the
candle
,
to
his
head
and
face
.
``
Ha-ha
!
Well
,
I
suppose
I
*NL*
deserve
it
,
considering
how
I
have
played
with
them
both
,
''
he
said
at
*NL*
last
,
as
much
to
himself
as
to
Venn
.
``
But
of
all
the
odd
things
that
*NL*
ever
I
knew
,
the
oddest
is
that
you
should
so
run
counter
to
your
own
*NL*
interests
as
to
bring
this
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
interests
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
'T
was
your
interest
not
to
do
anything
which
would
send
me
*NL*
courting
Thomasin
again
,
now
she
has
accepted
you
--
or
something
like
*NL*
it
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
says
you
are
to
marry
her
.
'T
is
n't
true
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
I
heard
of
this
before
,
but
did
n't
believe
it
.
When
did
*NL*
she
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
began
humming
as
the
reddleman
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
now
,
''
cried
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ru-um-tum-tum
,
''
sang
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lord
--
how
we
can
imitate
!
''
said
Venn
contemptuously
.
``
I
'll
have
*NL*
this
out
.
I
'll
go
straight
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diggory
withdrew
with
an
emphatic
step
,
Wildeve
's
eye
passing
*NL*
over
his
form
in
withering
derision
,
as
if
he
were
no
more
than
a
*NL*
heath-cropper
.
When
the
reddleman
's
figure
could
no
longer
be
seen
,
*NL*
Wildeve
himself
descended
and
plunged
into
the
rayless
hollow
of
the
*NL*
vale
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
lose
the
two
women
--
he
who
had
been
the
well-beloved
of
both
--
was
*NL*
too
ironical
an
issue
to
be
endured
.
He
could
only
decently
save
*NL*
himself
by
Thomasin
;
and
once
he
became
her
husband
,
Eustacia
's
*NL*
repentance
,
he
thought
,
would
set
in
for
a
long
and
bitter
term
.
It
*NL*
was
no
wonder
that
Wildeve
,
ignorant
of
the
new
man
at
the
back
of
the
*NL*
scene
,
should
have
supposed
Eustacia
to
be
playing
a
part
.
To
believe
*NL*
that
the
letter
was
not
the
result
of
some
momentary
pique
,
to
infer
*NL*
that
she
really
gave
him
up
to
Thomasin
,
would
have
required
previous
*NL*
knowledge
of
her
transfiguration
by
that
man
's
influence
.
Who
was
to
*NL*
know
that
she
had
grown
generous
in
the
greediness
of
a
new
passion
,
*NL*
that
in
coveting
one
cousin
she
was
dealing
liberally
with
another
,
*NL*
that
in
her
eagerness
to
appropriate
she
gave
way
?
*NL*
*NL*
Full
of
this
resolve
to
marry
in
haste
,
and
wring
the
heart
of
the
*NL*
proud
girl
,
Wildeve
went
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Diggory
Venn
had
returned
to
his
van
,
where
he
stood
looking
*NL*
thoughtfully
into
the
stove
.
A
new
vista
was
opened
up
to
him
.
*NL*
But
,
however
promising
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
views
of
him
might
be
as
a
*NL*
candidate
for
her
niece
's
hand
,
one
condition
was
indispensable
to
the
*NL*
favour
of
Thomasin
herself
,
and
that
was
a
renunciation
of
his
present
*NL*
wild
mode
of
life
.
In
this
he
saw
little
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
afford
to
wait
till
the
next
day
before
seeing
Thomasin
*NL*
and
detailing
his
plan
.
He
speedily
plunged
himself
into
toilet
*NL*
operations
,
pulled
a
suit
of
cloth
clothes
from
a
box
,
and
in
about
*NL*
twenty
minutes
stood
before
the
van-lantern
as
a
reddleman
in
nothing
*NL*
but
his
face
,
the
vermilion
shades
of
which
were
not
to
be
removed
in
*NL*
a
day
.
Closing
the
door
and
fastening
it
with
a
padlock
,
Venn
set
off
*NL*
towards
Blooms-End
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
reached
the
white
palings
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
gate
when
*NL*
the
door
of
the
house
opened
,
and
quickly
closed
again
.
A
female
*NL*
form
had
glided
in
.
At
the
same
time
a
man
,
who
had
seemingly
been
*NL*
standing
with
the
woman
in
the
porch
,
came
forward
from
the
house
till
*NL*
he
was
face
to
face
with
Venn
.
It
was
Wildeve
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
alive
,
you
've
been
quick
at
it
,
''
said
Diggory
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
slow
,
as
you
will
find
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
``
And
,
''
lowering
his
*NL*
voice
,
``
you
may
as
well
go
back
again
now
.
I
've
claimed
her
,
and
got
*NL*
her
.
Good
night
,
reddleman
!
''
Thereupon
Wildeve
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
's
heart
sank
within
him
,
though
it
had
not
risen
unduly
high
.
*NL*
He
stood
leaning
over
the
palings
in
an
indecisive
mood
for
nearly
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
Then
he
went
up
the
garden
path
,
knocked
,
and
*NL*
asked
for
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
requesting
him
to
enter
she
came
to
the
porch
.
A
discourse
*NL*
was
carried
on
between
them
in
low
measured
tones
for
the
space
of
*NL*
ten
minutes
or
more
.
At
the
end
of
the
time
Mrs.
Yeobright
went
in
,
*NL*
and
Venn
sadly
retraced
his
steps
into
the
heath
.
When
he
had
again
*NL*
regained
his
van
he
lit
the
lantern
,
and
with
an
apathetic
face
at
*NL*
once
began
to
pull
off
his
best
clothes
,
till
in
the
course
of
a
few
*NL*
minutes
he
reappeared
as
the
confirmed
and
irretrievable
reddleman
*NL*
that
he
had
seemed
before
.

Firmness
Is
Discovered
in
a
Gentle
Heart
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
evening
the
interior
of
Blooms-End
,
though
cosy
and
*NL*
comfortable
,
had
been
rather
silent
.
Clym
Yeobright
was
not
at
home
.
*NL*
Since
the
Christmas
party
he
had
gone
on
a
few
days
'
visit
to
a
friend
*NL*
about
ten
miles
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shadowy
form
seen
by
Venn
to
part
from
Wildeve
in
the
porch
,
and
*NL*
quickly
withdraw
into
the
house
,
was
Thomasin
's
.
On
entering
she
threw
*NL*
down
a
cloak
which
had
been
carelessly
wrapped
round
her
,
and
came
*NL*
forward
to
the
light
,
where
Mrs.
Yeobright
sat
at
her
work-table
,
*NL*
drawn
up
within
the
settle
,
so
that
part
of
it
projected
into
the
*NL*
chimney-corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
your
going
out
after
dark
alone
,
Tamsin
,
''
said
her
aunt
*NL*
quietly
,
without
looking
up
from
her
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
been
just
outside
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
inquired
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
struck
by
a
change
in
the
tone
of
*NL*
Thomasin
's
voice
,
and
observing
her
.
Thomasin
's
cheek
was
flushed
to
*NL*
a
pitch
far
beyond
that
which
it
had
reached
before
her
troubles
,
and
*NL*
her
eyes
glittered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
HE
who
knocked
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
as
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wishes
the
marriage
to
be
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
What
--
is
he
anxious
?
''
Mrs.
Yeobright
directed
a
searching
*NL*
look
upon
her
niece
.
``
Why
did
not
Mr.
Wildeve
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
wish
to
.
You
are
not
friends
with
him
,
he
says
.
He
would
*NL*
like
the
wedding
to
be
the
day
after
tomorrow
,
quite
privately
;
at
the
*NL*
church
of
his
parish
--
not
at
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
And
what
did
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agreed
to
it
,
''
Thomasin
answered
firmly
.
``
I
am
a
practical
woman
*NL*
now
.
I
do
n't
believe
in
hearts
at
all
.
I
would
marry
him
under
any
*NL*
circumstances
since
--
since
Clym
's
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
letter
was
lying
on
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
work-basket
,
and
at
Thomasin
's
*NL*
word
her
aunt
reopened
it
,
and
silently
read
for
the
tenth
time
that
*NL*
day
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
silly
story
that
people
are
*NL*
circulating
about
Thomasin
and
Mr.
Wildeve
?
I
should
call
*NL*
such
a
scandal
humiliating
if
there
was
the
least
chance
*NL*
of
its
being
true
.
How
could
such
a
gross
falsehood
have
*NL*
arisen
?
It
is
said
that
one
should
go
abroad
to
hear
*NL*
news
of
home
,
and
I
appear
to
have
done
it
.
Of
course
I
*NL*
contradict
the
tale
everywhere
;
but
it
is
very
vexing
,
*NL*
and
I
wonder
how
it
could
have
originated
.
It
is
too
*NL*
ridiculous
that
such
a
girl
as
Thomasin
could
so
mortify
*NL*
us
as
to
get
jilted
on
the
wedding-day
.
What
has
she
done
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Mrs.
Yeobright
said
sadly
,
putting
down
the
letter
.
``
If
you
*NL*
think
you
can
marry
him
,
do
so
.
And
since
Mr.
Wildeve
wishes
it
to
*NL*
be
unceremonious
,
let
it
be
that
too
.
I
can
do
nothing
.
It
is
all
in
*NL*
your
own
hands
now
.
My
power
over
your
welfare
came
to
an
end
when
you
*NL*
left
this
house
to
go
with
him
to
Anglebury
.
''
She
continued
,
half
in
*NL*
bitterness
,
``
I
may
almost
ask
,
why
do
you
consult
me
in
the
matter
at
*NL*
all
?
If
you
had
gone
and
married
him
without
saying
a
word
to
me
,
I
*NL*
could
hardly
have
been
angry
--
simply
because
,
poor
girl
,
you
ca
n't
do
*NL*
a
better
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
that
and
dishearten
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
:
I
will
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
plead
for
him
,
aunt
.
Human
nature
is
weak
,
and
I
am
not
a
*NL*
blind
woman
to
insist
that
he
is
perfect
.
I
did
think
so
,
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
now
.
But
I
know
my
course
,
and
you
know
that
I
know
it
.
I
hope
for
*NL*
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
do
I
,
and
we
will
both
continue
to
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
*NL*
rising
and
kissing
her
.
``
Then
the
wedding
,
if
it
comes
off
,
will
be
*NL*
on
the
morning
of
the
very
day
Clym
comes
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
decided
that
it
ought
to
be
over
before
he
came
.
After
that
*NL*
you
can
look
him
in
the
face
,
and
so
can
I
.
Our
concealments
will
*NL*
matter
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
moved
her
head
in
thoughtful
assent
,
and
presently
*NL*
said
,
``
Do
you
wish
me
to
give
you
away
?
I
am
willing
to
undertake
*NL*
that
,
you
know
,
if
you
wish
,
as
I
was
last
time
.
After
once
*NL*
forbidding
the
banns
I
think
I
can
do
no
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
will
ask
you
to
come
,
''
said
Thomasin
reluctantly
,
but
*NL*
with
decision
.
``
It
would
be
unpleasant
,
I
am
almost
sure
.
Better
let
*NL*
there
be
only
strangers
present
,
and
none
of
my
relations
at
all
.
I
*NL*
would
rather
have
it
so
.
I
do
not
wish
to
do
anything
which
may
touch
*NL*
your
credit
,
and
I
feel
that
I
should
be
uncomfortable
if
you
were
*NL*
there
,
after
what
has
passed
.
I
am
only
your
niece
,
and
there
is
no
*NL*
necessity
why
you
should
concern
yourself
more
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
has
beaten
us
,
''
her
aunt
said
.
``
It
really
seems
as
if
he
*NL*
had
been
playing
with
you
in
this
way
in
revenge
for
my
humbling
him
*NL*
as
I
did
by
standing
up
against
him
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
aunt
,
''
murmured
Thomasin
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
said
no
more
on
the
subject
then
.
Diggory
Venn
's
knock
came
soon
*NL*
after
;
and
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
on
returning
from
her
interview
with
him
*NL*
in
the
porch
,
carelessly
observed
,
``
Another
lover
has
come
to
ask
for
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
queer
young
man
Venn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Asks
to
pay
his
addresses
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
I
told
him
he
was
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
looked
silently
into
the
candle-flame
.
``
Poor
Diggory
!
''
she
*NL*
said
,
and
then
aroused
herself
to
other
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
passed
in
mere
mechanical
deeds
of
preparation
,
both
*NL*
the
women
being
anxious
to
immerse
themselves
in
these
to
escape
the
*NL*
emotional
aspect
of
the
situation
.
Some
wearing
apparel
and
other
*NL*
articles
were
collected
anew
for
Thomasin
,
and
remarks
on
domestic
*NL*
details
were
frequently
made
,
so
as
to
obscure
any
inner
misgivings
*NL*
about
her
future
as
Wildeve
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
appointed
morning
came
.
The
arrangement
with
Wildeve
was
that
*NL*
he
should
meet
her
at
the
church
to
guard
against
any
unpleasant
*NL*
curiosity
which
might
have
affected
them
had
they
been
seen
walking
*NL*
off
together
in
the
usual
country
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
and
niece
stood
together
in
the
bedroom
where
the
bride
was
*NL*
dressing
.
The
sun
,
where
it
could
catch
it
,
made
a
mirror
of
*NL*
Thomasin
's
hair
,
which
she
always
wore
braided
.
It
was
braided
*NL*
according
to
a
calendric
system
:
the
more
important
the
day
the
more
*NL*
numerous
the
strands
in
the
braid
.
On
ordinary
working-days
she
*NL*
braided
it
in
threes
;
on
ordinary
Sundays
in
fours
;
at
May-polings
,
*NL*
gipsyings
,
and
the
like
,
she
braided
it
in
fives
.
Years
ago
she
had
*NL*
said
that
when
she
married
she
would
braid
it
in
sevens
.
She
had
*NL*
braided
it
in
sevens
today
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
that
I
will
wear
my
blue
silk
after
all
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
It
IS
my
wedding
day
,
even
though
there
may
be
something
*NL*
sad
about
the
time
.
I
mean
,
''
she
added
,
anxious
to
correct
any
*NL*
wrong
impression
,
``
not
sad
in
itself
,
but
in
its
having
had
great
*NL*
disappointment
and
trouble
before
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
breathed
in
a
way
which
might
have
been
called
a
sigh
.
*NL*
``
I
almost
wish
Clym
had
been
at
home
,
''
she
said
.
``
Of
course
you
chose
*NL*
the
time
because
of
his
absence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Partly
.
I
have
felt
that
I
acted
unfairly
to
him
in
not
telling
him
*NL*
all
;
but
,
as
it
was
done
not
to
grieve
him
,
I
thought
I
would
carry
*NL*
out
the
plan
to
its
end
,
and
tell
the
whole
story
when
the
sky
was
*NL*
clear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
practical
little
woman
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
smiling
.
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
and
he
--
no
,
I
do
n't
wish
anything
.
There
,
it
is
nine
*NL*
o'clock
,
''
she
interrupted
,
hearing
a
whizz
and
a
dinging
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
Damon
I
would
leave
at
nine
,
''
said
Thomasin
,
hastening
out
of
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
aunt
followed
.
When
Thomasin
was
going
up
the
little
walk
from
*NL*
the
door
to
the
wicket-gate
,
Mrs.
Yeobright
looked
reluctantly
at
her
,
*NL*
and
said
,
``
It
is
a
shame
to
let
you
go
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
necessary
,
''
said
Thomasin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
''
added
her
aunt
with
forced
cheerfulness
,
``
I
shall
call
*NL*
upon
you
this
afternoon
,
and
bring
the
cake
with
me
.
If
Clym
has
*NL*
returned
by
that
time
he
will
perhaps
come
too
.
I
wish
to
show
Mr.
*NL*
Wildeve
that
I
bear
him
no
ill-will
.
Let
the
past
be
forgotten
.
Well
,
*NL*
God
bless
you
!
There
,
I
do
n't
believe
in
old
superstitions
,
but
I
'll
*NL*
do
it
.
''
She
threw
a
slipper
at
the
retreating
figure
of
the
girl
,
who
*NL*
turned
,
smiled
,
and
went
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
steps
further
,
and
she
looked
back
.
``
Did
you
call
me
,
aunt
?
''
*NL*
she
tremulously
inquired
.
``
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Moved
by
an
uncontrollable
feeling
as
she
looked
upon
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
*NL*
worn
,
wet
face
,
she
ran
back
,
when
her
aunt
came
forward
,
and
they
met
*NL*
again
.
``
O
--
Tamsie
,
''
said
the
elder
,
weeping
,
``
I
do
n't
like
to
let
you
*NL*
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
--
am
--
''
Thomasin
began
,
giving
way
likewise
.
But
,
quelling
her
*NL*
grief
,
she
said
``
Good-bye
!
''
again
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mrs.
Yeobright
saw
a
little
figure
wending
its
way
between
*NL*
the
scratching
furze-bushes
,
and
diminishing
far
up
the
valley
--
a
*NL*
pale-blue
spot
in
a
vast
field
of
neutral
brown
,
solitary
and
*NL*
undefended
except
by
the
power
of
her
own
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
worst
feature
in
the
case
was
one
which
did
not
appear
in
the
*NL*
landscape
;
it
was
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
chosen
for
the
ceremony
by
Thomasin
and
Wildeve
had
been
so
*NL*
timed
as
to
enable
her
to
escape
the
awkwardness
of
meeting
her
cousin
*NL*
Clym
,
who
was
returning
the
same
morning
.
To
own
to
the
partial
truth
*NL*
of
what
he
had
heard
would
be
distressing
as
long
as
the
humiliating
*NL*
position
resulting
from
the
event
was
unimproved
.
It
was
only
after
a
*NL*
second
and
successful
journey
to
the
altar
that
she
could
lift
up
her
*NL*
head
and
prove
the
failure
of
the
first
attempt
a
pure
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
been
gone
from
Blooms-End
more
than
half
an
hour
when
*NL*
Yeobright
came
by
the
meads
from
the
other
direction
and
entered
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
an
early
breakfast
,
''
he
said
to
his
mother
after
greeting
her
.
*NL*
``
Now
I
could
eat
a
little
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
to
the
repeated
meal
,
and
he
went
on
in
a
low
,
anxious
*NL*
voice
,
apparently
imagining
that
Thomasin
had
not
yet
come
downstairs
,
*NL*
``
What
's
this
I
have
heard
about
Thomasin
and
Mr.
Wildeve
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
in
many
points
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
quietly
;
``
but
it
is
*NL*
all
right
now
,
I
hope
.
''
She
looked
at
the
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomasin
is
gone
to
him
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
pushed
away
his
breakfast
.
``
Then
there
is
a
scandal
of
some
*NL*
sort
,
and
that
's
what
's
the
matter
with
Thomasin
.
Was
it
this
that
*NL*
made
her
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Not
a
scandal
:
a
misfortune
.
I
will
tell
you
all
about
it
,
*NL*
Clym
.
You
must
not
be
angry
,
but
you
must
listen
,
and
you
'll
find
*NL*
that
what
we
have
done
has
been
done
for
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
told
him
the
circumstances
.
All
that
he
had
known
of
the
*NL*
affair
before
he
returned
from
Paris
was
that
there
had
existed
an
*NL*
attachment
between
Thomasin
and
Wildeve
,
which
his
mother
had
at
first
*NL*
discountenanced
,
but
had
since
,
owing
to
the
arguments
of
Thomasin
,
*NL*
looked
upon
in
a
little
more
favourable
light
.
When
she
,
therefore
,
*NL*
proceeded
to
explain
all
he
was
greatly
surprised
and
troubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
determined
that
the
wedding
should
be
over
before
you
came
*NL*
back
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
``
that
there
might
be
no
chance
of
her
*NL*
meeting
you
,
and
having
a
very
painful
time
of
it
.
That
's
why
she
has
*NL*
gone
to
him
;
they
have
arranged
to
be
married
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ca
n't
understand
it
,
''
said
Yeobright
,
rising
.
''
'T
is
so
unlike
*NL*
her
.
I
can
see
why
you
did
not
write
to
me
after
her
unfortunate
*NL*
return
home
.
But
why
did
n't
you
let
me
know
when
the
wedding
was
*NL*
going
to
be
--
the
first
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
felt
vexed
with
her
just
then
.
She
seemed
to
me
to
be
*NL*
obstinate
;
and
when
I
found
that
you
were
nothing
in
her
mind
I
vowed
*NL*
that
she
should
be
nothing
in
yours
.
I
felt
that
she
was

my
*NL*
niece

;
I
told
her
she
might
marry
,
but
that
I
should
take
no

interest
in
it
,
and
should
not
bother
you
about
it
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
n't
have
been
bothering
me

Mother

you
did
wrong

*NL*
*NL*

I
thought
it

disturb
you

throw
up
your
situation

injure
your
prospects
in
some
way
because
*NL*
of
it

so
I
said
nothing

Of
course
,
if
they
had
married
at
that
time
*NL*
in
a
proper
manner
,
I
should
have
told
you
at
once

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Yes

's
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
believe
it

Was
it
right
to
let
her
go

Suppose

really
a
bad
fellow
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he

she
'll
come
home
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
looked
more
into
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
useless
to
say
that
,
''
his
mother
answered
with
an
impatient
*NL*
look
of
sorrow
.
``
You
do
n't
know
how
bad
it
has
been
here
with
us
all
*NL*
these
weeks
,
Clym
.
You
do
n't
know
what
a
mortification
anything
of
*NL*
that
sort
is
to
a
woman
.
You
do
n't
know
the
sleepless
nights
we
've
*NL*
had
in
this
house
,
and
the
almost
bitter
words
that
have
passed
*NL*
between
us
since
that
Fifth
of
November
.
I
hope
never
to
pass
seven
*NL*
such
weeks
again
.
Tamsin
has
not
gone
outside
the
door
,
and
I
have
*NL*
been
ashamed
to
look
anybody
in
the
face
;
and
now
you
blame
me
for
*NL*
letting
her
do
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
to
set
that
trouble
*NL*
straight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
slowly
.
``
Upon
the
whole
I
do
n't
blame
you
.
But
just
*NL*
consider
how
sudden
it
seems
to
me
.
Here
was
I
,
knowing
nothing
;
and
*NL*
then
I
am
told
all
at
once
that
Tamsie
is
gone
to
be
married
.
Well
,
*NL*
I
suppose
there
was
nothing
better
to
do
.
Do
you
know
,
mother
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
after
a
moment
or
two
,
looking
suddenly
interested
in
his
*NL*
own
past
history
,
``
I
once
thought
of
Tamsin
as
a
sweetheart
?
Yes
,
I
*NL*
did
.
How
odd
boys
are
!
And
when
I
came
home
and
saw
her
this
time
she
*NL*
seemed
so
much
more
affectionate
than
usual
,
that
I
was
quite
reminded
*NL*
of
those
days
,
particularly
on
the
night
of
the
party
,
when
she
was
*NL*
unwell
.
We
had
the
party
just
the
same
--
was
not
that
rather
cruel
to
*NL*
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
made
no
difference
.
I
had
arranged
to
give
one
,
and
it
was
not
*NL*
worth
while
to
make
more
gloom
than
necessary
.
To
begin
by
shutting
*NL*
ourselves
up
and
telling
you
of
Tamsin
's
misfortunes
would
have
been
*NL*
a
poor
sort
of
welcome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
remained
thinking
.
``
I
almost
wish
you
had
not
had
that
party
,
''
*NL*
he
said
;
``
and
for
other
reasons
.
But
I
will
tell
you
in
a
day
or
two
.
*NL*
We
must
think
of
Tamsin
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
lapsed
into
silence
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
''
said
Yeobright
again
,
*NL*
in
a
tone
which
showed
some
slumbering
feeling
still
.
``
I
do
n't
think
*NL*
it
kind
to
Tamsin
to
let
her
be
married
like
this
,
and
neither
of
*NL*
us
there
to
keep
up
her
spirits
or
care
a
bit
about
her
.
She
has
n't
*NL*
disgraced
herself
,
or
done
anything
to
deserve
that
.
It
is
bad
enough
*NL*
that
the
wedding
should
be
so
hurried
and
unceremonious
,
without
our
*NL*
keeping
away
from
it
in
addition
.
Upon
my
soul
,
't
is
almost
a
shame
.
*NL*
I
'll
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
over
by
this
time
,
''
said
his
mother
with
a
sigh
;
``
unless
they
*NL*
were
late
,
or
he
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
shall
be
soon
enough
to
see
them
come
out
.
I
do
n't
quite
like
*NL*
your
keeping
me
in
ignorance
,
mother
,
after
all
.
Really
,
I
half
hope
*NL*
he
has
failed
to
meet
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
ruined
her
character
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
:
that
would
n't
ruin
Thomasin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
up
his
hat
and
hastily
left
the
house
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
looked
*NL*
rather
unhappy
,
and
sat
still
,
deep
in
thought
.
But
she
was
not
long
*NL*
left
alone
.
A
few
minutes
later
Clym
came
back
again
,
and
in
his
*NL*
company
came
Diggory
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
find
there
is
n't
time
for
me
to
get
there
,
''
said
Clym
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
married
?
''
Mrs.
Yeobright
inquired
,
turning
to
the
reddleman
*NL*
a
face
in
which
a
strange
strife
of
wishes
,
for
and
against
,
was
*NL*
apparent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
bowed
.
``
She
is
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
it
sounds
,
''
murmured
Clym
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
did
n't
disappoint
her
this
time
?
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
.
And
there
is
now
no
slight
on
her
name
.
I
was
hastening
*NL*
ath
`
art
to
tell
you
at
once
,
as
I
saw
you
were
not
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
came
you
to
be
there
?
How
did
you
know
it
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
in
that
neighbourhood
for
some
time
,
and
I
saw
them
go
*NL*
in
,
''
said
the
reddleman
.
``
Wildeve
came
up
to
the
door
,
punctual
as
*NL*
the
clock
.
I
did
n't
expect
it
of
him
.
''
He
did
not
add
,
as
he
might
*NL*
have
added
,
that
how
he
came
to
be
in
that
neighbourhood
was
not
by
*NL*
accident
;
that
,
since
Wildeve
's
resumption
of
his
right
to
Thomasin
,
*NL*
Venn
,
with
the
thoroughness
which
was
part
of
his
character
,
had
*NL*
determined
to
see
the
end
of
the
episode
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
there
?
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
hardly
.
I
stood
right
out
of
the
way
,
and
she
did
not
see
*NL*
me
.
''
The
reddleman
spoke
huskily
,
and
looked
into
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
gave
her
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Vye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
remarkable
!
Miss
Vye
!
It
is
to
be
considered
an
honour
,
*NL*
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
Miss
Vye
?
''
said
Clym
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Vye
's
granddaughter
,
of
Mistover
Knap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
proud
girl
from
Budmouth
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
``
One
not
much
to
*NL*
my
liking
.
People
say
she
's
a
witch
,
but
of
course
that
's
absurd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
kept
to
himself
his
acquaintance
with
that
fair
*NL*
personage
,
and
also
that
Eustacia
was
there
because
he
went
to
fetch
*NL*
her
,
in
accordance
with
a
promise
he
had
given
as
soon
as
he
learnt
*NL*
that
the
marriage
was
to
take
place
.
He
merely
said
,
in
continuation
*NL*
of
the
story
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sitting
on
the
churchyard
wall
when
they
came
up
,
one
from
one
*NL*
way
,
the
other
from
the
other
;
and
Miss
Vye
was
walking
thereabouts
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
head-stones
.
As
soon
as
they
had
gone
in
I
went
to
*NL*
the
door
,
feeling
I
should
like
to
see
it
,
as
I
knew
her
so
well
.
I
*NL*
pulled
off
my
boots
because
they
were
so
noisy
,
and
went
up
into
the
*NL*
gallery
.
I
saw
then
that
the
parson
and
clerk
were
already
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
came
Miss
Vye
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
,
if
she
was
only
on
*NL*
a
walk
that
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
there
was
nobody
else
.
She
had
gone
into
the
church
just
*NL*
before
me
,
not
into
the
gallery
.
The
parson
looked
round
before
*NL*
beginning
,
and
as
she
was
the
only
one
near
he
beckoned
to
her
,
and
*NL*
she
went
up
to
the
rails
.
After
that
,
when
it
came
to
signing
the
*NL*
book
,
she
pushed
up
her
veil
and
signed
;
and
Tamsin
seemed
to
thank
*NL*
her
for
her
kindness
.
''
The
reddleman
told
the
tale
thoughtfully
,
*NL*
for
there
lingered
upon
his
vision
the
changing
colour
of
Wildeve
,
*NL*
when
Eustacia
lifted
the
thick
veil
which
had
concealed
her
from
*NL*
recognition
and
looked
calmly
into
his
face
.
``
And
then
,
''
said
Diggory
*NL*
sadly
,
``
I
came
away
,
for
her
history
as
Tamsin
Yeobright
was
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
offered
to
go
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
regretfully
.
``
But
she
said
it
*NL*
was
not
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
no
matter
,
''
said
the
reddleman
.
``
The
thing
is
done
at
*NL*
last
as
it
was
meant
to
be
at
first
,
and
God
send
her
happiness
.
Now
*NL*
I
'll
wish
you
good
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
placed
his
cap
on
his
head
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
instant
of
leaving
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
door
,
the
reddleman
was
*NL*
seen
no
more
in
or
about
Egdon
Heath
for
a
space
of
many
months
.
He
*NL*
vanished
entirely
.
The
nook
among
the
brambles
where
his
van
had
been
*NL*
standing
was
as
vacant
as
ever
the
next
morning
,
and
scarcely
a
sign
*NL*
remained
to
show
that
he
had
been
there
,
excepting
a
few
straws
,
and
a
*NL*
little
redness
on
the
turf
,
which
was
washed
away
by
the
next
storm
of
*NL*
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
report
that
Diggory
had
brought
of
the
wedding
,
correct
as
far
*NL*
as
it
went
,
was
deficient
in
one
significant
particular
,
which
had
*NL*
escaped
him
through
his
being
at
some
distance
back
in
the
church
.
*NL*
When
Thomasin
was
tremblingly
engaged
in
signing
her
name
Wildeve
had
*NL*
flung
towards
Eustacia
a
glance
that
said
plainly
,
``
I
have
punished
*NL*
you
now
.
''
She
had
replied
in
a
low
tone
--
and
he
little
thought
how
*NL*
truly
--
``
You
mistake
;
it
gives
me
sincerest
pleasure
to
see
her
your
*NL*
wife
today

*NL*
In
Clym
Yeobright
's
face
could
be
dimly
seen
the
typical
countenance
*NL*
of
the
future
.
Should
there
be
a
classic
period
to
art
hereafter
,
its
*NL*
Pheidias
may
produce
such
faces
.
The
view
of
life
as
a
thing
to
be
*NL*
put
up
with
,
replacing
that
zest
for
existence
which
was
so
intense
*NL*
in
early
civilizations
,
must
ultimately
enter
so
thoroughly
into
the
*NL*
constitution
of
the
advanced
races
that
its
facial
expression
will
*NL*
become
accepted
as
a
new
artistic
departure
.
People
already
feel
that
*NL*
a
man
who
lives
without
disturbing
a
curve
of
feature
,
or
setting
*NL*
a
mark
of
mental
concern
anywhere
upon
himself
,
is
too
far
removed
*NL*
from
modern
perceptiveness
to
be
a
modern
type
.
Physically
beautiful
*NL*
men
--
the
glory
of
the
race
when
it
was
young
--
are
almost
an
*NL*
anachronism
now
;
and
we
may
wonder
whether
,
at
some
time
or
other
,
*NL*
physically
beautiful
women
may
not
be
an
anachronism
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
seems
to
be
that
a
long
line
of
disillusive
centuries
has
*NL*
permanently
displaced
the
Hellenic
idea
of
life
,
or
whatever
it
may
*NL*
be
called
.
What
the
Greeks
only
suspected
we
know
well
;
what
their
*NL*
Aeschylus
imagined
our
nursery
children
feel
.
That
old-fashioned
*NL*
revelling
in
the
general
situation
grows
less
and
less
possible
as
we
*NL*
uncover
the
defects
of
natural
laws
,
and
see
the
quandary
that
man
is
*NL*
in
by
their
operation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lineaments
which
will
get
embodied
in
ideals
based
upon
this
*NL*
new
recognition
will
probably
be
akin
to
those
of
Yeobright
.
The
*NL*
observer
's
eye
was
arrested
,
not
by
his
face
as
a
picture
,
but
by
*NL*
his
face
as
a
page
;
not
by
what
it
was
,
but
by
what
it
recorded
.
*NL*
His
features
were
attractive
in
the
light
of
symbols
,
as
sounds
*NL*
intrinsically
common
become
attractive
in
language
,
and
as
shapes
*NL*
intrinsically
simple
become
interesting
in
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
a
lad
of
whom
something
was
expected
.
Beyond
this
all
had
*NL*
been
chaos
.
That
he
would
be
successful
in
an
original
way
,
or
that
*NL*
he
would
go
to
the
dogs
in
an
original
way
,
seemed
equally
probable
.
*NL*
The
only
absolute
certainty
about
him
was
that
he
would
not
stand
*NL*
still
in
the
circumstances
amid
which
he
was
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
,
when
his
name
was
casually
mentioned
by
neighbouring
yeomen
,
*NL*
the
listener
said
,
``
Ah
,
Clym
Yeobright
:
what
is
he
doing
now
?
''
When
*NL*
the
instinctive
question
about
a
person
is
,
What
is
he
doing
?
it
is
*NL*
felt
that
he
will
be
found
to
be
,
like
most
of
us
,
doing
nothing
in
*NL*
particular
.
There
is
an
indefinite
sense
that
he
must
be
invading
*NL*
some
region
of
singularity
,
good
or
bad
.
The
devout
hope
is
that
he
*NL*
is
doing
well
.
The
secret
faith
is
that
he
is
making
a
mess
of
it
.
*NL*
Half
a
dozen
comfortable
marketmen
,
who
were
habitual
callers
at
the
*NL*
Quiet
Woman
as
they
passed
by
in
their
carts
,
were
partial
to
the
*NL*
topic
.
In
fact
,
though
they
were
not
Egdon
men
,
they
could
hardly
*NL*
avoid
it
while
they
sucked
their
long
clay
tubes
and
regarded
the
*NL*
heath
through
the
window
.
Clym
had
been
so
inwoven
with
the
heath
in
*NL*
his
boyhood
that
hardly
anybody
could
look
upon
it
without
thinking
of
*NL*
him
.
So
the
subject
recurred
:
if
he
were
making
a
fortune
and
a
name
,
*NL*
so
much
the
better
for
him
;
if
he
were
making
a
tragical
figure
in
the
*NL*
world
,
so
much
the
better
for
a
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
that
Yeobright
's
fame
had
spread
to
an
awkward
extent
*NL*
before
he
left
home
.
``
It
is
bad
when
your
fame
outruns
your
means
,
''
*NL*
said
the
Spanish
Jesuit
Gracian
.
At
the
age
of
six
he
had
asked
a
*NL*
Scripture
riddle
:
``
Who
was
the
first
man
known
to
wear
breeches
?
''
*NL*
and
applause
had
resounded
from
the
very
verge
of
the
heath
.
At
*NL*
seven
he
painted
the
Battle
of
Waterloo
with
tiger-lily
pollen
and
*NL*
black-currant
juice
,
in
the
absence
of
water-colours
.
By
the
time
*NL*
he
reached
twelve
he
had
in
this
manner
been
heard
of
as
artist
*NL*
and
scholar
for
at
least
two
miles
round
.
An
individual
whose
fame
*NL*
spreads
three
or
four
thousand
yards
in
the
time
taken
by
the
fame
*NL*
of
others
similarly
situated
to
travel
six
or
eight
hundred
,
must
of
*NL*
necessity
have
something
in
him
.
Possibly
Clym
's
fame
,
like
Homer
's
,
*NL*
owed
something
to
the
accidents
of
his
situation
;
nevertheless
famous
*NL*
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
grew
up
and
was
helped
out
in
life
.
That
waggery
of
fate
which
*NL*
started
Clive
as
a
writing
clerk
,
Gay
as
a
linen-draper
,
Keats
as
a
*NL*
surgeon
,
and
a
thousand
others
in
a
thousand
other
odd
ways
,
banished
*NL*
the
wild
and
ascetic
heath
lad
to
a
trade
whose
sole
concern
was
with
*NL*
the
especial
symbols
of
self-indulgence
and
vainglory
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
details
of
this
choice
of
a
business
for
him
it
is
not
necessary
*NL*
to
give
.
At
the
death
of
his
father
a
neighbouring
gentleman
had
*NL*
kindly
undertaken
to
give
the
boy
a
start
,
and
this
assumed
the
form
*NL*
of
sending
him
to
Budmouth
.
Yeobright
did
not
wish
to
go
there
,
but
*NL*
it
was
the
only
feasible
opening
.
Thence
he
went
to
London
;
and
*NL*
thence
,
shortly
after
,
to
Paris
,
where
he
had
remained
till
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
being
expected
of
him
,
he
had
not
been
at
home
many
days
*NL*
before
a
great
curiosity
as
to
why
he
stayed
on
so
long
began
to
*NL*
arise
in
the
heath
.
The
natural
term
of
a
holiday
had
passed
,
yet
*NL*
he
still
remained
.
On
the
Sunday
morning
following
the
week
of
*NL*
Thomasin
's
marriage
a
discussion
on
this
subject
was
in
progress
at
*NL*
a
hair-cutting
before
Fairway
's
house
.
Here
the
local
barbering
was
*NL*
always
done
at
this
hour
on
this
day
,
to
be
followed
by
the
great
*NL*
Sunday
wash
of
the
inhabitants
at
noon
,
which
in
its
turn
was
followed
*NL*
by
the
great
Sunday
dressing
an
hour
later
.
On
Egdon
Heath
Sunday
*NL*
proper
did
not
begin
till
dinner-time
,
and
even
then
it
was
a
somewhat
*NL*
battered
specimen
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
Sunday-morning
hair-cuttings
were
performed
by
Fairway
;
the
*NL*
victim
sitting
on
a
chopping-block
in
front
of
the
house
,
without
a
*NL*
coat
,
and
the
neighbours
gossiping
around
,
idly
observing
the
locks
*NL*
of
hair
as
they
rose
upon
the
wind
after
the
snip
,
and
flew
away
out
*NL*
of
sight
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
heavens
.
Summer
and
winter
the
*NL*
scene
was
the
same
,
unless
the
wind
were
more
than
usually
blusterous
,
*NL*
when
the
stool
was
shifted
a
few
feet
round
the
corner
.
To
complain
*NL*
of
cold
in
sitting
out
of
doors
,
hatless
and
coatless
,
while
Fairway
*NL*
told
true
stories
between
the
cuts
of
the
scissors
,
would
have
been
*NL*
to
pronounce
yourself
no
man
at
once
.
To
flinch
,
exclaim
,
or
move
a
*NL*
muscle
of
the
face
at
the
small
stabs
under
the
ear
received
from
*NL*
those
instruments
,
or
at
scarifications
of
the
neck
by
the
comb
,
would
*NL*
have
been
thought
a
gross
breach
of
good
manners
,
considering
that
*NL*
Fairway
did
it
all
for
nothing
.
A
bleeding
about
the
poll
on
Sunday
*NL*
afternoons
was
amply
accounted
for
by
the
explanation
.
``
I
have
had
my
*NL*
hair
cut
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
on
Yeobright
had
been
started
by
a
distant
view
of
*NL*
the
young
man
rambling
leisurely
across
the
heath
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
who
is
doing
well
elsewhere
would
n't
bide
here
two
or
three
*NL*
weeks
for
nothing
,
''
said
Fairway
.
``
He
's
got
some
project
in
's
*NL*
head
--
depend
upon
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
'
a
ca
n't
keep
a
diment
shop
here
,
''
said
Sam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
why
he
should
have
had
them
two
heavy
boxes
home
if
he
*NL*
had
not
been
going
to
bide
;
and
what
there
is
for
him
to
do
here
the
*NL*
Lord
in
heaven
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
many
more
surmises
could
be
indulged
in
Yeobright
had
come
*NL*
near
;
and
seeing
the
hair-cutting
group
he
turned
aside
to
join
them
.
*NL*
Marching
up
,
and
looking
critically
at
their
faces
for
a
moment
,
he
*NL*
said
,
without
introduction
,
``
Now
,
folks
,
let
me
guess
what
you
have
*NL*
been
talking
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
sure
,
if
you
will
,
''
said
Sam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
it
is
a
thing
I
should
n't
have
dreamed
of
doing
,
otherwise
,
''
*NL*
said
Fairway
in
a
tone
of
integrity
;
``
but
since
you
have
named
it
,
*NL*
Master
Yeobright
,
I
'll
own
that
we
was
talking
about
`
ee
.
We
were
*NL*
wondering
what
could
keep
you
home
here
mollyhorning
about
when
you
*NL*
have
made
such
a
world-wide
name
for
yourself
in
the
nick-nack
*NL*
trade
--
now
,
that
's
the
truth
o
`
t.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
''
said
Yeobright
,
with
unexpected
earnestness
.
``
I
am
*NL*
not
sorry
to
have
the
opportunity
.
I
've
come
home
because
,
all
things
*NL*
considered
,
I
can
be
a
trifle
less
useless
here
than
anywhere
else
.
*NL*
But
I
have
only
lately
found
this
out
.
When
I
first
got
away
from
*NL*
home
I
thought
this
place
was
not
worth
troubling
about
.
I
thought
*NL*
our
life
here
was
contemptible
.
To
oil
your
boots
instead
of
blacking
*NL*
them
,
to
dust
your
coat
with
a
switch
instead
of
a
brush
:
was
there
*NL*
ever
anything
more
ridiculous
?
I
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
't
is
;
so
't
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
--
you
are
wrong
;
it
is
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beg
your
pardon
,
we
thought
that
was
your
maning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
my
views
changed
my
course
became
very
depressing
.
I
found
*NL*
that
I
was
trying
to
be
like
people
who
had
hardly
anything
in
common
*NL*
with
myself
.
I
was
endeavouring
to
put
off
one
sort
of
life
for
*NL*
another
sort
of
life
,
which
was
not
better
than
the
life
I
had
known
*NL*
before
.
It
was
simply
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
;
a
sight
different
,
''
said
Fairway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Paris
must
be
a
taking
place
,
''
said
Humphrey
.
``
Grand
*NL*
shop-winders
,
trumpets
,
and
drums
;
and
here
be
we
out
of
doors
in
all
*NL*
winds
and
weathers
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
mistake
me
,
''
pleaded
Clym
.
``
All
this
was
very
depressing
.
*NL*
But
not
so
depressing
as
something
I
next
perceived
--
that
my
business
*NL*
was
the
idlest
,
vainest
,
most
effeminate
business
that
ever
a
man
*NL*
could
be
put
to
.
That
decided
me
:
I
would
give
it
up
and
try
to
*NL*
follow
some
rational
occupation
among
the
people
I
knew
best
,
and
*NL*
to
whom
I
could
be
of
most
use
.
I
have
come
home
;
and
this
is
how
I
*NL*
mean
to
carry
out
my
plan
.
I
shall
keep
a
school
as
near
to
Egdon
as
*NL*
possible
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
walk
over
here
and
have
a
night-school
*NL*
in
my
mother
's
house
.
But
I
must
study
a
little
at
first
,
to
get
*NL*
properly
qualified
.
Now
,
neighbours
,
I
must
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Clym
resumed
his
walk
across
the
heath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
never
carry
it
out
in
the
world
,
''
said
Fairway
.
``
In
a
few
weeks
*NL*
he
'll
learn
to
see
things
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
good-hearted
of
the
young
man
,
''
said
another
.
``
But
,
for
my
*NL*
part
,
I
think
he
had
better
mind
his
business
.

*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
The
New
Course
Causes
Disappointment
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
loved
his
kind
.
He
had
a
conviction
that
the
want
of
most
*NL*
men
was
knowledge
of
a
sort
which
brings
wisdom
rather
than
affluence
.
*NL*
He
wished
to
raise
the
class
at
the
expense
of
individuals
rather
than
*NL*
individuals
at
the
expense
of
the
class
.
What
was
more
,
he
was
ready
*NL*
at
once
to
be
the
first
unit
sacrificed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
passing
from
the
bucolic
to
the
intellectual
life
the
intermediate
*NL*
stages
are
usually
two
at
least
,
frequently
many
more
;
and
one
of
*NL*
those
stages
is
almost
sure
to
be
worldly
advance
.
We
can
hardly
*NL*
imagine
bucolic
placidity
quickening
to
intellectual
aims
without
*NL*
imagining
social
aims
as
the
transitional
phase
.
Yeobright
's
local
*NL*
peculiarity
was
that
in
striving
at
high
thinking
he
still
cleaved
*NL*
to
plain
living
--
nay
,
wild
and
meagre
living
in
many
respects
,
and
*NL*
brotherliness
with
clowns
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
John
the
Baptist
who
took
ennoblement
rather
than
repentance
*NL*
for
his
text
.
Mentally
he
was
in
a
provincial
future
,
that
is
,
he
was
*NL*
in
many
points
abreast
with
the
central
town
thinkers
of
his
date
.
*NL*
Much
of
this
development
he
may
have
owed
to
his
studious
life
in
*NL*
Paris
,
where
he
had
become
acquainted
with
ethical
systems
popular
at
*NL*
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
consequence
of
this
relatively
advanced
position
,
Yeobright
might
*NL*
have
been
called
unfortunate
.
The
rural
world
was
not
ripe
for
him
.
*NL*
A
man
should
be
only
partially
before
his
time
:
to
be
completely
to
*NL*
the
vanward
in
aspirations
is
fatal
to
fame
.
Had
Philip
's
warlike
son
*NL*
been
intellectually
so
far
ahead
as
to
have
attempted
civilization
*NL*
without
bloodshed
,
he
would
have
been
twice
the
godlike
hero
that
he
*NL*
seemed
,
but
nobody
would
have
heard
of
an
Alexander
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
interests
of
renown
the
forwardness
should
lie
chiefly
in
the
*NL*
capacity
to
handle
things
.
Successful
propagandists
have
succeeded
*NL*
because
the
doctrine
they
bring
into
form
is
that
which
their
*NL*
listeners
have
for
some
time
felt
without
being
able
to
shape
.
A
man
*NL*
who
advocates
aesthetic
effort
and
deprecates
social
effort
is
only
*NL*
likely
to
be
understood
by
a
class
to
which
social
effort
has
become
a
*NL*
stale
matter
.
To
argue
upon
the
possibility
of
culture
before
luxury
*NL*
to
the
bucolic
world
may
be
to
argue
truly
,
but
it
is
an
attempt
*NL*
to
disturb
a
sequence
to
which
humanity
has
been
long
accustomed
.
*NL*
Yeobright
preaching
to
the
Egdon
eremites
that
they
might
rise
to
*NL*
a
serene
comprehensiveness
without
going
through
the
process
of
*NL*
enriching
themselves
,
was
not
unlike
arguing
to
ancient
Chaldeans
that
*NL*
in
ascending
from
earth
to
the
pure
empyrean
it
was
not
necessary
to
*NL*
pass
first
into
the
intervening
heaven
of
ether
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
Yeobright
's
mind
well-proportioned
?
No
.
A
well-proportioned
mind
*NL*
is
one
which
shows
no
particular
bias
;
one
of
which
we
may
safely
*NL*
say
that
it
will
never
cause
its
owner
to
be
confined
as
a
madman
,
*NL*
tortured
as
a
heretic
,
or
crucified
as
a
blasphemer
.
Also
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
that
it
will
never
cause
him
to
be
applauded
as
a
prophet
,
*NL*
revered
as
a
priest
,
or
exalted
as
a
king
.
Its
usual
blessings
are
*NL*
happiness
and
mediocrity
.
It
produces
the
poetry
of
Rogers
,
the
*NL*
paintings
of
West
,
the
statecraft
of
North
,
the
spiritual
guidance
*NL*
of
Tomline
;
enabling
its
possessors
to
find
their
way
to
wealth
,
to
*NL*
wind
up
well
,
to
step
with
dignity
off
the
stage
,
to
die
comfortably
*NL*
in
their
beds
,
and
to
get
the
decent
monument
which
,
in
many
*NL*
cases
,
they
deserve
.
It
never
would
have
allowed
Yeobright
to
do
*NL*
such
a
ridiculous
thing
as
throw
up
his
business
to
benefit
his
*NL*
fellow-creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
along
towards
home
without
attending
to
paths
.
If
anyone
*NL*
knew
the
heath
well
it
was
Clym
.
He
was
permeated
with
its
scenes
,
*NL*
with
its
substance
,
and
with
its
odours
.
He
might
be
said
to
be
its
*NL*
product
.
His
eyes
had
first
opened
thereon
;
with
its
appearance
all
*NL*
the
first
images
of
his
memory
were
mingled
;
his
estimate
of
life
*NL*
had
been
coloured
by
it
:
his
toys
had
been
the
flint
knives
and
*NL*
arrow-heads
which
he
found
there
,
wondering
why
stones
should
``
grow
''
*NL*
to
such
odd
shapes
;
his
flowers
,
the
purple
bells
and
yellow
furze
;
*NL*
his
animal
kingdom
,
the
snakes
and
croppers
;
his
society
,
its
human
*NL*
haunters
.
Take
all
the
varying
hates
felt
by
Eustacia
Vye
towards
the
*NL*
heath
,
and
translate
them
into
loves
,
and
you
have
the
heart
of
Clym
.
*NL*
He
gazed
upon
the
wide
prospect
as
he
walked
,
and
was
glad
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
many
persons
this
Egdon
was
a
place
which
had
slipped
out
of
its
*NL*
century
generations
ago
,
to
intrude
as
an
uncouth
object
into
this
.
*NL*
It
was
an
obsolete
thing
,
and
few
cared
to
study
it
.
How
could
this
*NL*
be
otherwise
in
the
days
of
square
fields
,
plashed
hedges
,
and
meadows
*NL*
watered
on
a
plan
so
rectangular
that
on
a
fine
day
they
looked
*NL*
like
silver
gridirons
?
The
farmer
,
in
his
ride
,
who
could
smile
at
*NL*
artificial
grasses
,
look
with
solicitude
at
the
coming
corn
,
and
sigh
*NL*
with
sadness
at
the
fly-eaten
turnips
,
bestowed
upon
the
distant
*NL*
upland
of
heath
nothing
better
than
a
frown
.
But
as
for
Yeobright
,
*NL*
when
he
looked
from
the
heights
on
his
way
he
could
not
help
indulging
*NL*
in
a
barbarous
satisfaction
at
observing
that
,
in
some
of
the
attempts
*NL*
at
reclamation
from
the
waste
,
tillage
,
after
holding
on
for
a
year
*NL*
or
two
,
had
receded
again
in
despair
,
the
ferns
and
furze-tufts
*NL*
stubbornly
reasserting
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
descended
into
the
valley
,
and
soon
reached
his
home
at
Blooms-End
.
*NL*
His
mother
was
snipping
dead
leaves
from
the
window-plants
.
She
looked
*NL*
up
at
him
as
if
she
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
his
long
stay
*NL*
with
her
;
her
face
had
worn
that
look
for
several
days
.
He
could
*NL*
perceive
that
the
curiosity
which
had
been
shown
by
the
hair-cutting
*NL*
group
amounted
in
his
mother
to
concern
.
But
she
had
asked
no
question
*NL*
with
her
lips
,
even
when
the
arrival
of
his
trunk
suggested
that
he
*NL*
was
not
going
to
leave
her
soon
.
Her
silence
besought
an
explanation
*NL*
of
him
more
loudly
than
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
going
back
to
Paris
again
,
mother
,
''
he
said
.
``
At
least
,
in
*NL*
my
old
capacity
.
I
have
given
up
the
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
turned
in
pained
surprise
.
``
I
thought
something
was
*NL*
amiss
,
because
of
the
boxes
.
I
wonder
you
did
not
tell
me
sooner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
have
done
it
.
But
I
have
been
in
doubt
whether
you
would
*NL*
be
pleased
with
my
plan
.
I
was
not
quite
clear
on
a
few
points
*NL*
myself
.
I
am
going
to
take
an
entirely
new
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
astonished
,
Clym
.
How
can
you
want
to
do
better
than
you
've
*NL*
been
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
easily
.
But
I
shall
not
do
better
in
the
way
you
mean
;
I
*NL*
suppose
it
will
be
called
doing
worse
.
But
I
hate
that
business
of
*NL*
mine
,
and
I
want
to
do
some
worthy
thing
before
I
die
.
As
a
*NL*
schoolmaster
I
think
to
do
it
--
a
school-master
to
the
poor
and
*NL*
ignorant
,
to
teach
them
what
nobody
else
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
the
trouble
that
has
been
taken
to
give
you
a
start
,
and
*NL*
when
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
straight
on
towards
affluence
,
*NL*
you
say
you
will
be
a
poor
man
's
schoolmaster
.
Your
fancies
will
be
*NL*
your
ruin
,
Clym
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
spoke
calmly
,
but
the
force
of
feeling
behind
the
words
*NL*
was
but
too
apparent
to
one
who
knew
her
as
well
as
her
son
did
.
He
*NL*
did
not
answer
.
There
was
in
his
face
that
hopelessness
of
being
*NL*
understood
which
comes
when
the
objector
is
constitutionally
beyond
*NL*
the
reach
of
a
logic
that
,
even
under
favouring
conditions
,
is
almost
*NL*
too
coarse
a
vehicle
for
the
subtlety
of
the
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
more
was
said
on
the
subject
till
the
end
of
dinner
.
His
mother
*NL*
then
began
,
as
if
there
had
been
no
interval
since
the
morning
.
``
It
*NL*
disturbs
me
,
Clym
,
to
find
that
you
have
come
home
with
such
thoughts
*NL*
as
those
.
I
had
n't
the
least
idea
that
you
meant
to
go
backward
in
*NL*
the
world
by
your
own
free
choice
.
Of
course
,
I
have
always
supposed
*NL*
you
were
going
to
push
straight
on
,
as
other
men
do
--
all
who
deserve
*NL*
the
name
--
when
they
have
been
put
in
a
good
way
of
doing
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
help
it
,
''
said
Clym
,
in
a
troubled
tone
.
``
Mother
,
I
hate
*NL*
the
flashy
business
.
Talk
about
men
who
deserve
the
name
,
can
any
man
*NL*
deserving
the
name
waste
his
time
in
that
effeminate
way
,
when
he
sees
*NL*
half
the
world
going
to
ruin
for
want
of
somebody
to
buckle
to
and
*NL*
teach
them
how
to
breast
the
misery
they
are
born
to
?
I
get
up
every
*NL*
morning
and
see
the
whole
creation
groaning
and
travailing
in
pain
,
*NL*
as
St.
Paul
says
,
and
yet
there
am
I
,
trafficking
in
glittering
*NL*
splendours
with
wealthy
women
and
titled
libertines
,
and
pandering
*NL*
to
the
meanest
vanities
--
I
,
who
have
health
and
strength
enough
for
*NL*
anything
.
I
have
been
troubled
in
my
mind
about
it
all
the
year
,
and
*NL*
the
end
is
that
I
can
not
do
it
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ca
n't
you
do
it
as
well
as
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
except
that
there
are
many
things
other
people
care
*NL*
for
which
I
do
n't
;
and
that
's
partly
why
I
think
I
ought
to
do
this
.
*NL*
For
one
thing
,
my
body
does
not
require
much
of
me
.
I
can
not
enjoy
*NL*
delicacies
;
good
things
are
wasted
upon
me
.
Well
,
I
ought
to
turn
*NL*
that
defect
to
advantage
,
and
by
being
able
to
do
without
what
other
*NL*
people
require
I
can
spend
what
such
things
cost
upon
anybody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Yeobright
,
having
inherited
some
of
these
very
instincts
from
*NL*
the
woman
before
him
,
could
not
fail
to
awaken
a
reciprocity
in
her
*NL*
through
her
feelings
,
if
not
by
arguments
,
disguise
it
as
she
might
*NL*
for
his
good
.
She
spoke
with
less
assurance
.
``
And
yet
you
might
have
*NL*
been
a
wealthy
man
if
you
had
only
persevered
.
Manager
to
that
large
*NL*
diamond
establishment
--
what
better
can
a
man
wish
for
?
What
a
post
of
*NL*
trust
and
respect
!
I
suppose
you
will
be
like
your
father
;
like
him
,
*NL*
you
are
getting
weary
of
doing
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
her
son
,
``
I
am
not
weary
of
that
,
though
I
am
weary
of
what
*NL*
you
mean
by
it

Mother
,
what
is
doing
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
was
far
too
thoughtful
a
woman
to
be
content
with
ready
*NL*
definitions
,
and
,
like
the
``
What
is
wisdom
?
''
of
Plato
's
Socrates
,
and
*NL*
the
``
What
is
truth
?
''
of
Pontius
Pilate
,
Yeobright
's
burning
question
*NL*
received
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
was
broken
by
the
clash
of
the
garden
gate
,
a
tap
at
the
*NL*
door
,
and
its
opening
.
Christian
Cantle
appeared
in
the
room
in
his
*NL*
Sunday
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
custom
on
Egdon
to
begin
the
preface
to
a
story
before
*NL*
absolutely
entering
the
house
,
so
as
to
be
well
in
for
the
body
of
*NL*
the
narrative
by
the
time
visitor
and
visited
stood
face
to
face
.
*NL*
Christian
had
been
saying
to
them
while
the
door
was
leaving
its
*NL*
latch
,
``
To
think
that
I
,
who
go
from
home
but
once
in
a
while
,
and
*NL*
hardly
then

should
have
been
there
this
morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
news
you
have
brought
us
,
then
,
Christian
?

said
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

sure
,
about
a
witch

and
ye
must
overlook
my
time
o

day

for

*NL*
says
I
,

I
must
go
and
tell
'em
,
though
they
wo
n't
have
half
done
*NL*
dinner
.
'
I
assure
ye
it
made
me
shake
like
a
driven
leaf
.
Do
ye
think
*NL*
any
harm
will
come
o
`

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
morning
at
church
we
was
all
standing
up
,
and
the
pa
`
son
said
,
*NL*
`
Let
us
pray
.
'
`
Well
,
'
thinks
I
,
`
one
may
as
well
kneel
as
stand
'
;
*NL*
so
down
I
went
;
and
,
more
than
that
,
all
the
rest
were
as
willing
to
*NL*
oblige
the
man
as
I
.
We
had
n't
been
hard
at
it
for
more
than
a
minute
*NL*
when
a
most
terrible
screech
sounded
through
church
,
as
if
somebody
*NL*
had
just
gied
up
their
heart
's
blood
.
All
the
folk
jumped
up
and
*NL*
then
we
found
that
Susan
Nunsuch
had
pricked
Miss
Vye
with
a
long
*NL*
stocking-needle
,
as
she
had
threatened
to
do
as
soon
as
ever
she
could
*NL*
get
the
young
lady
to
church
,
where
she
do
n't
come
very
often
.
She
've
*NL*
waited
for
this
chance
for
weeks
,
so
as
to
draw
her
blood
and
put
an
*NL*
end
to
the
bewitching
of
Susan
's
children
that
has
been
carried
on
so
*NL*
long
.
Sue
followed
her
into
church
,
sat
next
to
her
,
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
could
find
a
chance
in
went
the
stocking-needle
into
my
lady
's
*NL*
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heaven
,
how
horrid
!
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sue
pricked
her
that
deep
that
the
maid
fainted
away
;
and
as
I
was
*NL*
afeard
there
might
be
some
tumult
among
us
,
I
got
behind
the
bass-viol
*NL*
and
did
n't
see
no
more
.
But
they
carried
her
out
into
the
air
,
't
is
*NL*
said
;
but
when
they
looked
round
for
Sue
she
was
gone
.
What
a
scream
*NL*
that
girl
gied
,
poor
thing
!
There
were
the
pa
`
son
in
his
surplice
*NL*
holding
up
his

saying
,
`
Sit
down

sit
down

But
the
deuce
a
bit
would
they
sit
down

O

and
what
d'ye
think
I
*NL*
found
out

Mrs.
Yeobright

pa

wears
a
suit

could
see
his
black
sleeves

held
up

'T
is
a
cruel

said
Yeobright

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
his
mother

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

``
Here

Humphrey

*NL*
In
came
Humphrey

``
Well

whenever
one
of
Egdon
folk
goes
to

church
some
rum
job
or
other
is
sure
to
be
doing

The
last
time
one
*NL*
of
us
was
there
was
when

Fairway
went
in
the
fall

and
that
*NL*

the
day

forbad

*NL*
*NL*
``
Has

cruelly

walk
home

Clym

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
she
got
better

Humphrey

When
they
were
gone
into
the
heath
again
Yeobright
said
quietly
to
his
*NL*
mother
,
``
Do
you
think
I
have
turned
teacher
too
soon

*NL*
``

she
replied
.

right

you
out

richer

Later
in
the
day
Sam

the
turf-cutter

entered

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
mopes
about
by
herself
,
and
do
n't
mix
in
with
the
people

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
a
young
lady
inclined
for
adventures
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
my
knowledge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
join
in
with
the
lads
in
their
games
,
to
get
some
sort
of
*NL*
excitement
in
this
lonely
place
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mumming
,
for
instance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Her
notions
be
different
.
I
should
rather
say
her
thoughts
were
*NL*
far
away
from
here
,
with
lords
and
ladies
she
'll
never
know
,
and
*NL*
mansions
she
'll
never
see
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Observing
that
Clym
appeared
singularly
interested
Mrs.
Yeobright
said
*NL*
rather
uneasily
to
Sam
,
``
You
see
more
in
her
than
most
of
us
do
.
Miss
*NL*
Vye
is
to
my
mind
too
idle
to
be
charming
.
I
have
never
heard
that
*NL*
she
is
of
any
use
to
herself
or
to
other
people
.
Good
girls
do
n't
get
*NL*
treated
as
witches
even
on
Egdon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
--
that
proves
nothing
either
way
,
''
said
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
of
course
I
do
n't
understand
such
niceties
,
''
said
Sam
,
*NL*
withdrawing
from
a
possibly
unpleasant
argument
;
``
and
what
she
is
we
*NL*
must
wait
for
time
to
tell
us
.
The
business
that
I
have
really
called
*NL*
about
is
this
,
to
borrow
the
longest
and
strongest
rope
you
have
.
The
*NL*
captain
's
bucket
has
dropped
into
the
well
,
and
they
are
in
want
of
*NL*
water
;
and
as
all
the
chaps
are
at
home
today
we
think
we
can
get
it
*NL*
out
for
him
.
We
have
three
cart-ropes
already
,
but
they
wo
n't
reach
*NL*
to
the
bottom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
told
him
that
he
might
have
whatever
ropes
he
could
*NL*
find
in
the
outhouse
,
and
Sam
went
out
to
search
.
When
he
passed
by
*NL*
the
door
Clym
joined
him
,
and
accompanied
him
to
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
young
witch-lady
going
to
stay
long
at
Mistover
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
cruel
shame
to
ill-use
her
,
She
must
have
suffered
*NL*
greatly

more
in
mind
than
in
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
a
graceless
trick

such
a
handsome
girl

too
.
You
ought
to
see
*NL*
her
,
Mr.
Yeobright
,
being
a
young
man
come
from
far
,
and
with
a
little
*NL*
more
to
show
for
your
years
than
most
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
she
would
like
to
teach
children
?
''
said
Clym
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sam
shook
his
head
.
``
Quite
a
different
sort
of
body
from
that
,
I
*NL*
reckon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
it
was
merely
something
which
occurred
to
me
.
It
would
of
course
*NL*
be
necessary
to
see
her
and
talk
it
over
--
not
an
easy
thing
,
by
the
*NL*
way
,
for
my
family
and
hers
are
not
very
friendly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
how
you
mid
see
her
,
Mr.
Yeobright
,
''
said
Sam
.
``
We
are
*NL*
going
to
grapple
for
the
bucket
at
six
o'clock
tonight
at
her
house
,
*NL*
and
you
could
lend
a
hand
.
There
's
five
or
six
coming
,
but
the
well
is
*NL*
deep
,
and
another
might
be
useful
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
appearing
in
that
*NL*
shape

She
's
sure
to
be
walking
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
think
of
it
,
''
said
Yeobright
;
and
they
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
it
a
good
deal
;
but
nothing
more
was
said
about
Eustacia
*NL*
inside
the
house
at
that
time
.
Whether
this
romantic
martyr
to
*NL*
superstition
and
the
melancholy
mummer
he
had
conversed
with
under
the
*NL*
full
moon
were
one
and
the
same
person
remained
as
yet
a
problem

III
*NL*
*NL*
The
First
Act
in
a
Timeworn
Drama
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
was
fine
,
and
Yeobright
walked
on
the
heath
for
an
hour
*NL*
with
his
mother
.
When
they
reached
the
lofty
ridge
which
divided
the
*NL*
valley
of
Blooms-End
from
the
adjoining
valley
they
stood
still
and
*NL*
looked
round
.
The
Quiet
Woman
Inn
was
visible
on
the
low
margin
of
the
*NL*
heath
in
one
direction
,
and
afar
on
the
other
hand
rose
Mistover
Knap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
to
call
on
Thomasin
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
you
need
not
come
this
time
,
''
said
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
I
'll
branch
off
here
,
mother
.
I
am
going
to
Mistover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
turned
to
him
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
help
them
get
the
bucket
out
of
the
captain
's
well
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
.
``
As
it
is
so
very
deep
I
may
be
useful
.
And
I
should
like
*NL*
to
see
this
Miss
Vye
--
not
so
much
for
her
good
looks
as
for
another
*NL*
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
you
go
?
''
his
mother
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
parted
.
``
There
is
no
help
for
it
,
''
murmured
Clym
's
mother
*NL*
gloomily
as
he
withdrew
.
``
They
are
sure
to
see
each
other
.
I
wish
*NL*
Sam
would
carry
his
news
to
other
houses
than
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
's
retreating
figure
got
smaller
and
smaller
as
it
rose
and
fell
*NL*
over
the
hillocks
on
his
way
.
``
He
is
tender-hearted
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Yeobright
to
herself
while
she
watched
him
;
``
otherwise
it
would
matter
*NL*
little
.
How
he
's
going
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
indeed
,
walking
with
a
will
over
the
furze
,
as
straight
as
a
*NL*
line
,
as
if
his
life
depended
upon
it
.
His
mother
drew
a
long
breath
,
*NL*
and
,
abandoning
the
visit
to
Thomasin
,
turned
back
.
The
evening
films
*NL*
began
to
make
nebulous
pictures
of
the
valleys
,
but
the
high
lands
*NL*
still
were
raked
by
the
declining
rays
of
the
winter
sun
,
which
*NL*
glanced
on
Clym
as
he
walked
forward
,
eyed
by
every
rabbit
and
*NL*
fieldfare
around
,
a
long
shadow
advancing
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
drawing
near
to
the
furze-covered
bank
and
ditch
which
fortified
*NL*
the
captain
's
dwelling
he
could
hear
voices
within
,
signifying
that
*NL*
operations
had
been
already
begun
.
At
the
side-entrance
gate
he
*NL*
stopped
and
looked
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
a
dozen
able-bodied
men
were
standing
in
a
line
from
the
*NL*
well-mouth
,
holding
a
rope
which
passed
over
the
well-roller
into
the
*NL*
depths
below
.
Fairway
,
with
a
piece
of
smaller
rope
round
his
body
,
*NL*
made
fast
to
one
of
the
standards
,
to
guard
against
accidents
,
was
*NL*
leaning
over
the
opening
,
his
right
hand
clasping
the
vertical
rope
*NL*
that
descended
into
the
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
silence
,
folks
,
''
said
Fairway
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
talking
ceased
,
and
Fairway
gave
a
circular
motion
to
the
rope
,
as
*NL*
if
he
were
stirring
batter
.
At
the
end
of
a
minute
a
dull
splashing
*NL*
reverberated
from
the
bottom
of
the
well
;
the
helical
twist
he
had
*NL*
imparted
to
the
rope
had
reached
the
grapnel
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Haul
!
''
said
Fairway
;
and
the
men
who
held
the
rope
began
to
gather
it
*NL*
over
the
wheel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
we
've
got
sommat
,
''
said
one
of
the
haulers-in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
pull
steady
,
''
said
Fairway
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
gathered
up
more
and
more
,
till
a
regular
dripping
into
the
well
*NL*
could
be
heard
below
.
It
grew
smarter
with
the
increasing
height
of
*NL*
the
bucket
,
and
presently
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
of
rope
had
been
*NL*
pulled
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fairway
then
lit
a
lantern
,
tied
it
to
another
cord
,
and
began
*NL*
lowering
it
into
the
well
beside
the
first
.
Clym
came
forward
and
*NL*
looked
down
.
Strange
humid
leaves
,
which
knew
nothing
of
the
seasons
*NL*
of
the
year
,
and
quaint-natured
mosses
were
revealed
on
the
wellside
*NL*
as
the
lantern
descended
;
till
its
rays
fell
upon
a
confused
mass
of
*NL*
rope
and
bucket
dangling
in
the
dank
,
dark
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
only
got
en
by
the
edge
of
the
hoop
--
steady
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
*NL*
said
Fairway
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
pulled
with
the
greatest
gentleness
,
till
the
wet
bucket
appeared
*NL*
about
two
yards
below
them
,
like
a
dead
friend
come
to
earth
again
.
*NL*
Three
or
four
hands
were
stretched
out
,
then
jerk
went
the
rope
,
whizz
*NL*
went
the
wheel
,
the
two
foremost
haulers
fell
backward
,
the
beating
of
*NL*
a
falling
body
was
heard
,
receding
down
the
sides
of
the
well
,
and
a
*NL*
thunderous
uproar
arose
at
the
bottom
.
The
bucket
was
gone
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
the
bucket
!
''
said
Fairway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lower
again
,
''
said
Sam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
as
stiff
as
a
ram
's
horn
stooping
so
long
,
''
said
Fairway
,
*NL*
standing
up
and
stretching
himself
till
his
joints
creaked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rest
a
few
minutes
,
Timothy
,
''
said
Yeobright
.
``
I
'll
take
your
*NL*
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grapnel
was
again
lowered
.
Its
smart
impact
upon
the
distant
*NL*
water
reached
their
ears
like
a
kiss
,
whereupon
Yeobright
knelt
down
,
*NL*
and
leaning
over
the
well
began
dragging
the
grapnel
round
and
round
*NL*
as
Fairway
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tie
a
rope
round
him
--
it
is
dangerous
!
''
cried
a
soft
and
anxious
*NL*
voice
somewhere
above
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
turned
.
The
speaker
was
a
woman
,
gazing
down
upon
the
group
*NL*
from
an
upper
window
,
whose
panes
blazed
in
the
ruddy
glare
from
the
*NL*
west
.
Her
lips
were
parted
and
she
appeared
for
the
moment
to
forget
*NL*
where
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rope
was
accordingly
tied
round
his
waist
,
and
the
work
proceeded
.
*NL*
At
the
next
haul
the
weight
was
not
heavy
,
and
it
was
discovered
that
*NL*
they
had
only
secured
a
coil
of
the
rope
detached
from
the
bucket
.
*NL*
The
tangled
mass
was
thrown
into
the
background
.
Humphrey
took
*NL*
Yeobright
's
place
,
and
the
grapnel
was
lowered
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
retired
to
the
heap
of
recovered
rope
in
a
meditative
mood
.
*NL*
Of
the
identity
between
the
lady
's
voice
and
that
of
the
melancholy
*NL*
mummer
he
had
not
a
moment
's
doubt
.
``
How
thoughtful
of
her
!
''
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
,
who
had
reddened
when
she
perceived
the
effect
of
her
*NL*
exclamation
upon
the
group
below
,
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
at
the
*NL*
window
,
though
Yeobright
scanned
it
wistfully
.
While
he
stood
there
*NL*
the
men
at
the
well
succeeded
in
getting
up
the
bucket
without
a
*NL*
mishap
.
One
of
them
went
to
inquire
for
the
captain
,
to
learn
what
*NL*
orders
he
wished
to
give
for
mending
the
well-tackle
.
The
captain
*NL*
proved
to
be
away
from
home
,
and
Eustacia
appeared
at
the
door
and
*NL*
came
out
.
She
had
lapsed
into
an
easy
and
dignified
calm
,
far
removed
*NL*
from
the
intensity
of
life
in
her
words
of
solicitude
for
Clym
's
*NL*
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
it
be
possible
to
draw
water
here
tonight
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
miss
;
the
bottom
of
the
bucket
is
clean
knocked
out
.
And
as
we
*NL*
can
do
no
more
now
we
'll
leave
off
,
and
come
again
tomorrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
water
,
''
she
murmured
,
turning
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
send
you
up
some
from
Blooms-End
,
''
said
Clym
,
coming
forward
*NL*
and
raising
his
hat
as
the
men
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
and
Eustacia
looked
at
each
other
for
one
instant
,
as
if
*NL*
each
had
in
mind
those
few
moments
during
which
a
certain
moonlight
*NL*
scene
was
common
to
both
.
With
the
glance
the
calm
fixity
of
her
*NL*
features
sublimed
itself
to
an
expression
of
refinement
and
warmth
:
*NL*
it
was
like
garish
noon
rising
to
the
dignity
of
sunset
in
a
couple
*NL*
of
seconds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
it
will
hardly
be
necessary
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
have
no
water
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
what
I
call
no
water
,
''
she
said
,
blushing
,
and
lifting
*NL*
her
long-lashed
eyelids
as
if
to
lift
them
were
a
work
requiring
*NL*
consideration
.
``
But
my
grandfather
calls
it
water
enough
.
I
'll
show
*NL*
you
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
moved
away
a
few
yards
,
and
Clym
followed
.
When
she
reached
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
enclosure
,
where
the
steps
were
formed
for
mounting
the
*NL*
boundary
bank
,
she
sprang
up
with
a
lightness
which
seemed
strange
*NL*
after
her
listless
movement
towards
the
well
.
It
incidentally
showed
*NL*
that
her
apparent
languor
did
not
arise
from
lack
of
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
ascended
behind
her
,
and
noticed
a
circular
burnt
patch
at
the
*NL*
top
of
the
bank
.
``
Ashes
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Eustacia
.
``
We
had
a
little
bonfire
here

Fifth

*NL*
November
,
and
those
are
the
marks
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
spot
had
stood
the
fire
she
had
kindled
to
attract
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
only
kind
of
water
we
have
,
''
she
continued
,
tossing
a
*NL*
stone
into
the
pool
,
which
lay
on
the
outside
of
the
bank
like
the
*NL*
white
of
an
eye
without
its
pupil
.
The
stone
fell
with
a
flounce
,
*NL*
but
no
Wildeve
appeared
on
the
other
side
,
as
on
a
previous
occasion
*NL*
there
.
``
My
grandfather
says
he
lived
for
more
than
twenty
years
at
*NL*
sea
on
water
twice
as
bad
as
that
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
and
considers
it
*NL*
quite
good
enough
for
us
here
on
an
emergency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
no
impurities
in
the
water
of
*NL*
these
pools
at
this
time
of
the
year
.
It
has
only
just
rained
into
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
``
I
am
managing
to
exist
in
a
wilderness
,
but
I
*NL*
can
not
drink
from
a
pond
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
looked
towards
the
well
,
which
was
now
deserted
,
the
men
having
*NL*
gone
home
.
``
It
is
a
long
way
to
send
for
spring-water
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
after
a
silence
.
``
But
since
you
do
n't
like
this
in
the
pond
,
I
'll
try
*NL*
to
get
you
some
myself
.
''
He
went
back
to
the
well
.
``
Yes
,
I
think
I
*NL*
could
do
it
by
tying
on
this
pail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
since
I
would
not
trouble
the
men
to
get
it
,
I
can
not
in
*NL*
conscience
let
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
the
trouble
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
fast
the
pail
to
the
long
coil
of
rope
,
put
it
over
the
wheel
,
*NL*
and
allowed
it
to
descend
by
letting
the
rope
slip
through
his
hands
.
*NL*
Before
it
had
gone
far
,
however
,
he
checked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
make
fast
the
end
first
,
or
we
may
lose
the
whole
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
Eustacia
,
who
had
drawn
near
.
``
Could
you
hold
this
a
moment
,
while
I
*NL*
do
it
--
or
shall
I
call
your
servant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
hold
it
,
''
said
Eustacia
;
and
he
placed
the
rope
in
her
hands
,
*NL*
going
then
to
search
for
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
may
let
it
slip
down
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
advise
you
not
to
let
it
go
far
,
''
said
Clym
.
``
It
will
get
*NL*
much
heavier
,
you
will
find
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
Eustacia
had
begun
to
pay
out
.
While
he
was
tying
she
cried
,
*NL*
``
I
can
not
stop
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
ran
to
her
side
,
and
found
he
could
only
check
the
rope
by
*NL*
twisting
the
loose
part
round
the
upright
post
,
when
it
stopped
with
a
*NL*
jerk
.
``
Has
it
hurt
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
think
not
.
''
She
opened
her
hands
.
One
of
them
was
bleeding
;
*NL*
the
rope
had
dragged
off
the
skin
.
Eustacia
wrapped
it
in
her
*NL*
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
let
go
,
''
said
Yeobright
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
I
was
to
hold
on
...
This
is
the
second
time
I
have
been
*NL*
wounded
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
;
I
have
heard
of
it
.
I
blush
for
my
native
Egdon
.
Was
it
a
*NL*
serious
injury
you
received
in
church
,
Miss
Vye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
such
an
abundance
of
sympathy
in
Clym
's
tone
that
Eustacia
*NL*
slowly
drew
up
her
sleeve
and
disclosed
her
round
white
arm
.
A
bright
*NL*
red
spot
appeared
on
its
smooth
surface
,
like
a
ruby
on
Parian
marble
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
is
,
''
she
said
,
putting
her
finger
against
the
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
dastardly
of
the
woman
,
''
said
Clym
.
``
Will
not
Captain
Vye
get
*NL*
her
punished
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
gone
from
home
on
that
very
business
.
I
did
not
know
that
I
*NL*
had
such
a
magic
reputation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
fainted
?
''
said
Clym
,
looking
at
the
scarlet
little
puncture
*NL*
as
if
he
would
like
to
kiss
it
and
make
it
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
frightened
me
.
I
had
not
been
to
church
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
And
now
I
shall
not
go
again
for
ever
so
long
--
perhaps
never
.
I
*NL*
can
not
face
their
eyes
after
this
.
Do
n't
you
think
it
dreadfully
*NL*
humiliating
?
I
wished
I
was
dead
for
hours
after
,
but
I
do
n't
mind
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
to
clean
away
these
cobwebs
,
''
said
Yeobright
.
``
Would
you
*NL*
like
to
help
me
--
by
high-class
teaching
?
We
might
benefit
them
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
feel
anxious
to
.
I
have
not
much
love
for
my
*NL*
fellow-creatures
.
Sometimes
I
quite
hate
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
I
think
that
if
you
were
to
hear
my
scheme
you
might
take
an
*NL*
interest
in
it
.
There
is
no
use
in
hating
people
--
if
you
hate
*NL*
anything
,
you
should
hate
what
produced
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
Nature
?
I
hate
her
already
.
But
I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
*NL*
your
scheme
at
any
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
had
now
worked
itself
out
,
and
the
next
natural
thing
*NL*
was
for
them
to
part
.
Clym
knew
this
well
enough
,
and
Eustacia
made
a
*NL*
move
of
conclusion
;
yet
he
looked
at
her
as
if
he
had
one
word
more
*NL*
to
say
.
Perhaps
if
he
had
not
lived
in
Paris
it
would
never
have
been
*NL*
uttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
met
before
,
''
he
said
,
regarding
her
with
rather
more
interest
*NL*
than
was
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
own
it
,
''
said
Eustacia
,
with
a
repressed
,
still
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
may
think
what
I
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
lonely
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
endure
the
heath
,
except
in
its
purple
season
.
The
heath
is
*NL*
a
cruel
taskmaster
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
say
so
?
''
he
asked
.
``
To
my
mind
it
is
most
exhilarating
,
and
*NL*
strengthening
,
and
soothing
.
I
would
rather
live
on
these
hills
than
*NL*
anywhere
else
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
enough
for
artists
;
but
I
never
would
learn
to
draw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
is
a
very
curious
Druidical
stone
just
out
there
.
''
He
threw
*NL*
a
pebble
in
the
direction
signified
.
``
Do
you
often
go
to
see
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
even
aware
there
existed
any
such
curious
Druidical
stone
.
*NL*
I
am
aware
that
there
are
boulevards
in
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
looked
thoughtfully
on
the
ground
.
``
That
means
much
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
indeed
,
''
said
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
when
I
had
the
same
longing
for
town
bustle
.
Five
years
*NL*
of
a
great
city
would
be
a
perfect
cure
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
send
me
such
a
cure
!
Now
,
Mr.
Yeobright
,
I
will
go
indoors
and
*NL*
plaster
my
wounded
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
separated
,
and
Eustacia
vanished
in
the
increasing
shade
.
She
*NL*
seemed
full
of
many
things
.
Her
past
was
a
blank
,
her
life
had
begun
.
*NL*
The
effect
upon
Clym
of
this
meeting
he
did
not
fully
discover
till
*NL*
some
time
after
.
During
his
walk
home
his
most
intelligible
sensation
*NL*
was
that
his
scheme
had
somehow
become
glorified
.
A
beautiful
woman
*NL*
had
been
intertwined
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
house
he
went
up
to
the
room
which
was
to
be
made
his
*NL*
study
,
and
occupied
himself
during
the
evening
in
unpacking
his
books
*NL*
from
the
boxes
and
arranging
them
on
shelves
.
From
another
box
he
*NL*
drew
a
lamp
and
a
can
of
oil
.
He
trimmed
the
lamp
,
arranged
his
*NL*
table
,
and
said
,
``
Now
,
I
am
ready
to
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
early
the
next
morning
,
read
two
hours
before
breakfast
by
the
*NL*
light
of
his
lamp
--
read
all
the
morning
,
all
the
afternoon
.
Just
when
*NL*
the
sun
was
going
down
his
eyes
felt
weary
,
and
he
leant
back
in
his
*NL*
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
room
overlooked
the
front
of
the
premises
and
the
valley
of
the
*NL*
heath
beyond
.
The
lowest
beams
of
the
winter
sun
threw
the
shadow
of
*NL*
the
house
over
the
palings
,
across
the
grass
margin
of
the
heath
,
*NL*
and
far
up
the
vale
,
where
the
chimney
outlines
and
those
of
the
*NL*
surrounding
treetops
stretched
forth
in
long
dark
prongs
.
Having
*NL*
been
seated
at
work
all
day
,
he
decided
to
take
a
turn
upon
the
hills
*NL*
before
it
got
dark
;
and
,
going
out
forthwith
,
he
struck
across
the
*NL*
heath
towards
Mistover
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
hour
and
a
half
later
when
he
again
appeared
at
the
garden
*NL*
gate
.
The
shutters
of
the
house
were
closed
,
and
Christian
Cantle
,
*NL*
who
had
been
wheeling
manure
about
the
garden
all
day
,
had
gone
home
.
*NL*
On
entering
he
found
that
his
mother
,
after
waiting
a
long
time
for
*NL*
him
,
had
finished
her
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
been
,
Clym
?
''
she
immediately
said
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
*NL*
tell
me
that
you
were
going
away
at
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
on
the
heath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
meet
Eustacia
Vye
if
you
go
up
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
paused
a
minute
.
``
Yes
,
I
met
her
this
evening
,
''
he
said
,
as
*NL*
though
it
were
spoken
under
the
sheer
necessity
of
preserving
honesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wondered
if
you
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
no
appointment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
such
meetings
never
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
not
angry
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
hardly
say
that
I
am
not
.
Angry
?
No
.
But
when
I
consider
the
*NL*
usual
nature
of
the
drag
which
causes
men
of
promise
to
disappoint
the
*NL*
world
I
feel
uneasy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
deserve
credit
for
the
feeling
,
mother
.
But
I
can
assure
you
*NL*
that
you
need
not
be
disturbed
by
it
on
my
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
think
of
you
and
your
new
crotchets
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
*NL*
with
some
emphasis
,
``
I
naturally
do
n't
feel
so
comfortable
as
I
did
a
*NL*
twelvemonth
ago
.
It
is
incredible
to
me
that
a
man
accustomed
to
the
*NL*
attractive
women
of
Paris
and
elsewhere
should
be
so
easily
worked
*NL*
upon
by
a
girl
in
a
heath
.
You
could
just
as
well
have
walked
another
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
been
studying
all
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
''
she
added
more
hopefully
,
``
I
have
been
thinking
that
you
*NL*
might
get
on
as
a
schoolmaster
,
and
rise
that
way
,
since
you
really
*NL*
are
determined
to
hate
the
course
you
were
pursuing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
was
unwilling
to
disturb
this
idea
,
though
his
scheme
was
*NL*
far
enough
removed
from
one
wherein
the
education
of
youth
should
be
*NL*
made
a
mere
channel
of
social
ascent
.
He
had
no
desires
of
that
sort
.
*NL*
He
had
reached
the
stage
in
a
young
man
's
life
when
the
grimness
of
*NL*
the
general
human
situation
first
becomes
clear
;
and
the
realization
*NL*
of
this
causes
ambition
to
halt
awhile
.
In
France
it
is
not
*NL*
uncustomary
to
commit
suicide
at
this
stage
;
in
England
we
do
much
*NL*
better
,
or
much
worse
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
love
between
the
young
man
and
his
mother
was
strangely
invisible
*NL*
now
.
Of
love
it
may
be
said
,
the
less
earthly
the
less
demonstrative
.
*NL*
In
its
absolutely
indestructible
form
it
reaches
a
profundity
in
*NL*
which
all
exhibition
of
itself
is
painful
.
It
was
so
with
these
.
Had
*NL*
conversations
between
them
been
overheard
,
people
would
have
said
,
*NL*
``
How
cold
they
are
to
each
other
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
theory
and
his
wishes
about
devoting
his
future
to
teaching
*NL*
had
made
an
impression
on
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
Indeed
,
how
could
it
be
*NL*
otherwise
when
he
was
a
part
of
her
--
when
their
discourses
were
as
if
*NL*
carried
on
between
the
right
and
the
left
hands
of
the
same
body
?
He
*NL*
had
despaired
of
reaching
her
by
argument
;
and
it
was
almost
as
a
*NL*
discovery
to
him
that
he
could
reach
her
by
a
magnetism
which
was
as
*NL*
superior
to
words
as
words
are
to
yells
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strangely
enough
he
began
to
feel
now
that
it
would
not
be
so
hard
*NL*
to
persuade
her
who
was
his
best
friend
that
comparative
poverty
was
*NL*
essentially
the
higher
course
for
him
,
as
to
reconcile
to
his
feelings
*NL*
the
act
of
persuading
her
.
From
every
provident
point
of
view
his
*NL*
mother
was
so
undoubtedly
right
,
that
he
was
not
without
a
sickness
of
*NL*
heart
in
finding
he
could
shake
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
singular
insight
into
life
,
considering
that
she
had
never
*NL*
mixed
with
it
.
There
are
instances
of
persons
who
,
without
clear
*NL*
ideas
of
the
things
they
criticize
,
have
yet
had
clear
ideas
of
the
*NL*
relations
of
those
things
.
Blacklock
,
a
poet
blind
from
his
birth
,
*NL*
could
describe
visual
objects
with
accuracy
;
Professor
Sanderson
,
who
*NL*
was
also
blind
,
gave
excellent
lectures
on
colour
,
and
taught
others
*NL*
the
theory
of
ideas
which
they
had
and
he
had
not
.
In
the
social
*NL*
sphere
these
gifted
ones
are
mostly
women
;
they
can
watch
a
world
*NL*
which
they
never
saw
,
and
estimate
forces
of
which
they
have
only
*NL*
heard
.
We
call
it
intuition
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
the
great
world
to
Mrs.
Yeobright
?
A
multitude
whose
*NL*
tendencies
could
be
perceived
,
though
not
its
essences
.
Communities
*NL*
were
seen
by
her
as
from
a
distance
;
she
saw
them
as
we
see
the
*NL*
throngs
which
cover
the
canvases
of
Sallaert
,
Van
Alsloot
,
and
*NL*
others
of
that
school
--
vast
masses
of
beings
,
jostling
,
zigzagging
,
*NL*
and
processioning
in
definite
directions
,
but
whose
features
are
*NL*
indistinguishable
by
the
very
comprehensiveness
of
the
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
could
see
that
,
as
far
as
it
had
gone
,
her
life
was
very
complete
*NL*
on
its
reflective
side
.
The
philosophy
of
her
nature
,
and
its
*NL*
limitation
by
circumstances
,
was
almost
written
in
her
movements
.
*NL*
They
had
a
majestic
foundation
,
though
they
were
far
from
being
*NL*
majestic
;
and
they
had
a
groundwork
of
assurance
,
but
they
were
not
*NL*
assured
.
As
her
once
elastic
walk
had
become
deadened
by
time
,
so
had
*NL*
her
natural
pride
of
life
been
hindered
in
its
blooming
by
her
*NL*
necessities
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
slight
touch
in
the
shaping
of
Clym
's
destiny
occurred
a
few
*NL*
days
after
.
A
barrow
was
opened
on
the
heath
,
and
Yeobright
attended
*NL*
the
operation
,
remaining
away
from
his
study
during
several
hours
.
In
*NL*
the
afternoon
Christian
returned
from
a
journey
in
the
same
direction
,
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Yeobright
questioned
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
dug
a
hole
,
and
they
have
found
things
like
flowerpots
*NL*
upside
down
,
Mis
`
ess
Yeobright
;
and
inside
these
be
real
charnel
*NL*
bones
.
They
have
carried
'em
off
to
men
's
houses
;
but
I
should
n't
*NL*
like
to
sleep
where
they
will
bide
.
Dead
folks
have
been
known
to
come
*NL*
and
claim
their
own
.
Mr.
Yeobright
had
got
one
pot
of
the
bones
,
and
*NL*
was
going
to
bring
'em
home
--
real
skellington
bones
--
but
't
was
ordered
*NL*
otherwise
.
You
'll
be
relieved
to
hear
that
he
gave
away
his
pot
*NL*
and
all
,
on
second
thoughts
;
and
a
blessed
thing
for
ye
,
Mis
`
ess
*NL*
Yeobright
,
considering
the
wind
o
'
nights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gave
it
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
To
Miss
Vye
.
She
has
a
cannibal
taste
for
such
churchyard
*NL*
furniture
seemingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Vye
was
there
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
'
a
b
`
lieve
she
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Clym
came
home
,
which
was
shortly
after
,
his
mother
said
,
in
a
*NL*
curious
tone
,
``
The
urn
you
had
meant
for
me
you
gave
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
made
no
reply
;
the
current
of
her
feeling
was
too
pronounced
*NL*
to
admit
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
early
weeks
of
the
year
passed
on
.
Yeobright
certainly
studied
at
*NL*
home
,
but
he
also
walked
much
abroad
,
and
the
direction
of
his
walk
*NL*
was
always
towards
some
point
of
a
line
between
Mistover
and
*NL*
Rainbarrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
month
of
March
arrived
,
and
the
heath
showed
its
first
signs
of
*NL*
awakening
from
winter
trance
.
The
awakening
was
almost
feline
in
its
*NL*
stealthiness
.
The
pool
outside
the
bank
by
Eustacia
's
dwelling
,
which
*NL*
seemed
as
dead
and
desolate
as
ever
to
an
observer
who
moved
and
made
*NL*
noises
in
his
observation
,
would
gradually
disclose
a
state
of
great
*NL*
animation
when
silently
watched
awhile
.
A
timid
animal
world
had
come
*NL*
to
life
for
the
season
.
Little
tadpoles
and
efts
began
to
bubble
up
*NL*
through
the
water
,
and
to
race
along
beneath
it
;
toads
made
noises
*NL*
like
very
young
ducks
,
and
advanced
to
the
margin
in
twos
and
threes
;
*NL*
overhead
,
bumble-bees
flew
hither
and
thither
in
the
thickening
light
,
*NL*
their
drone
coming
and
going
like
the
sound
of
a
gong
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
an
evening
such
as
this
Yeobright
descended
into
the
Blooms-End
*NL*
valley
from
beside
that
very
pool
,
where
he
had
been
standing
with
*NL*
another
person
quite
silently
and
quite
long
enough
to
hear
all
this
*NL*
puny
stir
of
resurrection
in
nature
;
yet
he
had
not
heard
it
.
His
*NL*
walk
was
rapid
as
he
came
down
,
and
he
went
with
a
springy
tread
.
*NL*
Before
entering
upon
his
mother
's
premises
he
stopped
and
breathed
.
*NL*
The
light
which
shone
forth
on
him
from
the
window
revealed
that
*NL*
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
eye
bright
.
What
it
did
not
show
was
*NL*
something
which
lingered
upon
his
lips
like
a
seal
set
there
.
The
*NL*
abiding
presence
of
this
impress
was
so
real
that
he
hardly
dared
to
*NL*
enter
the
house
,
for
it
seemed
as
if
his
mother
might
say
,
``
What
red
*NL*
spot
is
that
glowing
upon
your
mouth
so
vividly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
entered
soon
after
.
The
tea
was
ready
,
and
he
sat
down
*NL*
opposite
his
mother
.
She
did
not
speak
many
words
;
and
as
for
him
,
*NL*
something
had
been
just
done
and
some
words
had
been
just
said
on
*NL*
the
hill
which
prevented
him
from
beginning
a
desultory
chat
.
His
*NL*
mother
's
taciturnity
was
not
without
ominousness
,
but
he
appeared
not
*NL*
to
care
.
He
knew
why
she
said
so
little
,
but
he
could
not
remove
the
*NL*
cause
of
her
bearing
towards
him
.
These
half-silent
sittings
were
far
*NL*
from
uncommon
with
them
now
.
At
last
Yeobright
made
a
beginning
of
*NL*
what
was
intended
to
strike
at
the
whole
root
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
days
have
we
sat
like
this
at
meals
with
scarcely
a
word
.
*NL*
What
's
the
use
of
it
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
,
''
said
she
,
in
a
heart-swollen
tone
.
``
But
there
is
only
too
*NL*
good
a
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
when
you
know
all
.
I
have
been
wanting
to
speak
about
this
,
and
*NL*
I
am
glad
the
subject
is
begun
.
The
reason
,
of
course
,
is
Eustacia
*NL*
Vye
.
Well
,
I
confess
I
have
seen
her
lately
,
and
have
seen
her
a
good
*NL*
many
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
and
I
know
what
that
amounts
to
.
It
troubles
me
,
Clym
.
*NL*
You
are
wasting
your
life
here
;
and
it
is
solely
on
account
of
her
.
*NL*
If
it
had
not
been
for
that
woman
you
would
never
have
entertained
*NL*
this
teaching
scheme
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
looked
hard
at
his
mother
.
``
You
know
that
is
not
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
know
you
had
decided
to
attempt
it
before
you
saw
her
;
but
*NL*
that
would
have
ended
in
intentions
.
It
was
very
well
to
talk
of
,
but
*NL*
ridiculous
to
put
in
practice
.
I
fully
expected
that
in
the
course
of
*NL*
a
month
or
two
you
would
have
seen
the
folly
of
such
self-sacrifice
,
*NL*
and
would
have
been
by
this
time
back
again
to
Paris
in
some
business
*NL*
or
other
.
I
can
understand
objections
to
the
diamond
trade
--
I
really
*NL*
was
thinking
that
it
might
be
inadequate
to
the
life
of
a
man
like
you
*NL*
even
though
it
might
have
made
you
a
millionaire
.
But
now
I
see
how
*NL*
mistaken
you
are
about
this
girl
I
doubt
if
you
could
be
correct
about
*NL*
other
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
am
I
mistaken
in
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
lazy
and
dissatisfied
.
But
that
is
not
all
of
it
.
Supposing
*NL*
her
to
be
as
good
a
woman
as
any
you
can
find
,
which
she
certainly
is
*NL*
not
,
why
do
you
wish
to
connect
yourself
with
anybody
at
present
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
are
practical
reasons
,
''
Clym
began
,
and
then
almost
broke
*NL*
off
under
an
overpowering
sense
of
the
weight
of
argument
which
could
*NL*
be
brought
against
his
statement
.
``
If
I
take
a
school
an
educated
*NL*
woman
would
be
invaluable
as
a
help
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
really
mean
to
marry
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
premature
to
state
that
plainly
.
But
consider
what
*NL*
obvious
advantages
there
would
be
in
doing
it
.
She
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
suppose
she
has
any
money
.
She
has
n't
a
farthing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
excellently
educated
,
and
would
make
a
good
matron
in
a
*NL*
boarding-school
.
I
candidly
own
that
I
have
modified
my
views
a
*NL*
little
,
in
deference
to
you
;
and
it
should
satisfy
you
.
I
no
longer
*NL*
adhere
to
my
intention
of
giving
with
my
own
mouth
rudimentary
*NL*
education
to
the
lowest
class
.
I
can
do
better
.
I
can
establish
a
*NL*
good
private
school
for
farmers
'
sons
,
and
without
stopping
the
*NL*
school
I
can
manage
to
pass
examinations
.
By
this
means
,
and
by
the
*NL*
assistance
of
a
wife
like
her
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Clym
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
ultimately
,
I
hope
,
be
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
best
schools
*NL*
in
the
county
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
had
enunciated
the
word
``
her
''
with
a
fervour
which
,
in
*NL*
conversation
with
a
mother
,
was
absurdly
indiscreet
.
Hardly
a
*NL*
maternal
heart
within
the
four
seas
could
,
in
such
circumstances
,
have
*NL*
helped
being
irritated
at
that
ill-timed
betrayal
of
feeling
for
a
new
*NL*
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
blinded
,
Clym
,
''
she
said
warmly
.
``
It
was
a
bad
day
for
you
*NL*
when
you
first
set
eyes
on
her
.
And
your
scheme
is
merely
a
castle
in
*NL*
the
air
built
on
purpose
to
justify
this
folly
which
has
seized
you
,
*NL*
and
to
salve
your
conscience
on
the
irrational
situation
you
are
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
that
's
not
true
,
''
he
firmly
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
maintain
that
I
sit
and
tell
untruths
,
when
all
I
wish
to
do
*NL*
is
to
save
you
from
sorrow
?
For
shame
,
Clym
!
But
it
is
all
through
*NL*
that
woman
--
a
hussy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
reddened
like
fire
and
rose
.
He
placed
his
hand
upon
his
*NL*
mother
's
shoulder
and
said
,
in
a
tone
which
hung
strangely
between
*NL*
entreaty
and
command
,
``
I
wo
n't
hear
it
.
I
may
be
led
to
answer
you
in
*NL*
a
way
which
we
shall
both
regret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
parted
her
lips
to
begin
some
other
vehement
truth
,
but
on
*NL*
looking
at
him
she
saw
that
in
his
face
which
led
her
to
leave
the
*NL*
words
unsaid
.
Yeobright
walked
once
or
twice
across
the
room
,
and
*NL*
then
suddenly
went
out
of
the
house
.
It
was
eleven
o'clock
when
he
*NL*
came
in
,
though
he
had
not
been
further
than
the
precincts
of
the
*NL*
garden
.
His
mother
was
gone
to
bed
.
A
light
was
left
burning
on
the
*NL*
table
,
and
supper
was
spread
.
Without
stopping
for
any
food
he
*NL*
secured
the
doors
and
went
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
An
Hour
of
Bliss
and
Many
Hours
of
Sadness
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
gloomy
enough
at
Blooms-End
.
Yeobright
remained
in
*NL*
his
study
,
sitting
over
the
open
books
;
but
the
work
of
those
hours
*NL*
was
miserably
scant
.
Determined
that
there
should
be
nothing
in
his
*NL*
conduct
towards
his
mother
resembling
sullenness
,
he
had
occasionally
*NL*
spoken
to
her
on
passing
matters
,
and
would
take
no
notice
of
the
*NL*
brevity
of
her
replies
.
With
the
same
resolve
to
keep
up
a
show
of
*NL*
conversation
he
said
,
about
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
``
There
's
an
*NL*
eclipse
of
the
moon
tonight
.
I
am
going
out
to
see
it
.
''
And
,
putting
*NL*
on
his
overcoat
,
he
left
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
low
moon
was
not
as
yet
visible
from
the
front
of
the
house
,
and
*NL*
Yeobright
climbed
out
of
the
valley
until
he
stood
in
the
full
flood
*NL*
of
her
light
.
But
even
now
he
walked
on
,
and
his
steps
were
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
Rainbarrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
half
an
hour
he
stood
at
the
top
.
The
sky
was
clear
from
verge
to
*NL*
verge
,
and
the
moon
flung
her
rays
over
the
whole
heath
,
but
without
*NL*
sensibly
lighting
it
,
except
where
paths
and
water-courses
had
laid
*NL*
bare
the
white
flints
and
glistening
quartz
sand
,
which
made
streaks
*NL*
upon
the
general
shade
.
After
standing
awhile
he
stooped
and
felt
the
*NL*
heather
.
It
was
dry
,
and
he
flung
himself
down
upon
the
barrow
,
his
*NL*
face
towards
the
moon
,
which
depicted
a
small
image
of
herself
in
each
*NL*
of
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
often
come
up
here
without
stating
his
purpose
to
his
mother
;
*NL*
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
ostensibly
frank
as
to
*NL*
his
purpose
while
really
concealing
it
.
It
was
a
moral
situation
*NL*
which
,
three
months
earlier
,
he
could
hardly
have
credited
of
himself
.
*NL*
In
returning
to
labour
in
this
sequestered
spot
he
had
anticipated
*NL*
an
escape
from
the
chafing
of
social
necessities
;
yet
behold
they
*NL*
were
here
also
.
More
than
ever
he
longed
to
be
in
some
world
where
*NL*
personal
ambition
was
not
the
only
recognized
form
of
progress
--
such
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
as
might
have
been
the
case
at
some
time
or
other
in
the
*NL*
silvery
globe
then
shining
upon
him
.
His
eye
travelled
over
the
*NL*
length
and
breadth
of
that
distant
country
--
over
the
Bay
of
Rainbows
,
*NL*
the
sombre
Sea
of
Crises
,
the
Ocean
of
Storms
,
the
Lake
of
Dreams
,
the
*NL*
vast
Walled
Plains
,
and
the
wondrous
Ring
Mountains
--
till
he
almost
*NL*
felt
himself
to
be
voyaging
bodily
through
its
wild
scenes
,
standing
*NL*
on
its
hollow
hills
,
traversing
its
deserts
,
descending
its
vales
and
*NL*
old
sea
bottoms
,
or
mounting
to
the
edges
of
its
craters
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
watched
the
far-removed
landscape
a
tawny
stain
grew
into
*NL*
being
on
the
lower
verge
:
the
eclipse
had
begun
.
This
marked
a
*NL*
preconcerted
moment
:
for
the
remote
celestial
phenomenon
had
been
*NL*
pressed
into
sublunary
service
as
a
lover
's
signal
.
Yeobright
's
mind
*NL*
flew
back
to
earth
at
the
sight
;
he
arose
,
shook
himself
and
listened
.
*NL*
Minute
after
minute
passed
by
,
perhaps
ten
minutes
passed
,
and
the
*NL*
shadow
on
the
moon
perceptibly
widened
.
He
heard
a
rustling
on
his
*NL*
left
hand
,
a
cloaked
figure
with
an
upturned
face
appeared
at
the
base
*NL*
of
the
Barrow
,
and
Clym
descended
.
In
a
moment
the
figure
was
in
his
*NL*
arms
,
and
his
lips
upon
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Eustacia
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clym
,
dearest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
situation
had
less
than
three
months
brought
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
remained
long
without
a
single
utterance
,
for
no
language
could
*NL*
reach
the
level
of
their
condition
:
words
were
as
the
rusty
implements
*NL*
of
a
by-gone
barbarous
epoch
,
and
only
to
be
occasionally
tolerated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
began
to
wonder
why
you
did
not
come
,
''
said
Yeobright
,
when
she
had
*NL*
withdrawn
a
little
from
his
embrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
ten
minutes
after
the
first
mark
of
shade
on
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
moon
,
and
that
's
what
it
is
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
us
only
think
that
here
we
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
holding
each
other
's
hand
,
they
were
again
silent
,
and
the
*NL*
shadow
on
the
moon
's
disc
grew
a
little
larger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
it
seemed
long
since
you
last
saw
me
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
seemed
sad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
long
?
That
's
because
you
occupy
yourself
,
and
so
blind
*NL*
yourself
to
my
absence
.
To
me
,
who
can
do
nothing
,
it
has
been
like
*NL*
living
under
stagnant
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
bear
tediousness
,
dear
,
than
have
time
made
short
by
*NL*
such
means
as

shortened
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
is
that
?
You
have
been
thinking
you
wished
you
did
not
*NL*
love
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
a
man
wish
that

and
yet
love
on

No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
can

women
can
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

whatever
I
may
have
thought

one
thing
is
certain

I

do
love

I
love
you

oppressiveness

never

more

passing
fancy

any

I
have
ever
seen

Let
me
look
right
into
*NL*
your
moonlit
face

dwell
on
every
line

curve
in
it

Only
a
*NL*
few
hair-breadths
make
the
difference
between
this
face

faces
I

have
seen
many
times
before
I
knew
you

yet
what
a
difference
--
the
*NL*
difference
between
everything
and
nothing
at
all
.
One
touch
on
that
*NL*
mouth
again
!
there

there
,

there

Your
eyes
seem
heavy

*NL*
Eustacia

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

it
is
my
general
way

looking

it
arises
from
my

feeling
sometimes
an
agonizing
pity
for
myself
that
I
ever
was
born

*NL*
``
You

now

*NL*
``
No

Yet
I
know
that

always

Nothing

ensure
the
continuance

love

It
will
evaporate
like
a
spirit

so
I
feel
full

fears

*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

more

end
in
this
way

started

then
endeavoured

the

Eustacia

At

``
Yes

*NL*
``
Now

she
continued

evasively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
talking
of
Paris

Well
,
I
remember
one
sunny
room
in
the
*NL*
Louvre
which
would
make
a
fitting
place
for
you
to
live
in
--
the
*NL*
Galerie
d'Apollon
.
Its
windows
are
mainly
east
;
and
in
the
early
*NL*
morning
,
when
the
sun
is
bright
,
the
whole
apartment
is
in
a
perfect
*NL*
blaze
of
splendour
.
The
rays
bristle
and
dart
from
the
encrustations
*NL*
of
gilding
to
the
magnificent
inlaid
coffers
,
from
the
coffers
to
*NL*
the
gold
and
silver
plate
,
from
the
plate
to
the
jewels
and
precious
*NL*
stones
,
from
these
to
the
enamels
,
till
there
is
a
perfect
network
of
*NL*
light
which
quite
dazzles
the
eye
.
But
now
,
about
our
marriage
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Versailles

the
King
's
Gallery

some
such
gorgeous
room

it
*NL*
not
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

But
what
's
the
use
of
talking
of
gorgeous
rooms
?
By
the
way
,
the
*NL*
Little
Trianon
would
suit
us
beautifully
to
live
in
,
and
you
might
*NL*
walk
in
the
gardens
in
the
moonlight
and
think
you
were
in
some
*NL*
English
shrubbery
;
it
is
laid
out
in
English
fashion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
hate
to
think
that
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
could
keep
to
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
Grand
Palace

All
about

you
would
doubtless
feel
in
a
world

historical
*NL*
romance

*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
,
since
it
was
all
new
to
her

described
Fontainebleau

St.
Cloud

the
Bois

many
other
familiar
haunts

I

*NL*
Clym
brought
her
face
towards
his
by

gentle
pressure

kissed
her

Well

it
go

see
how

slipping

slipping

She
pointed
towards
the
half
eclipsed
moon

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
mournful

*NL*
``
No

Clym

the
eclipsed

moonlight
shines
upon
your
face
with
a
strange
foreign
colour

*NL*
shows
its
shape
as
if
it
were
cut
out
in
gold

That
means
that

be
doing
better
things

*NL*

ambitious

yet

*NL*
far
from

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
that
in
his
tone
which
implied
distrust
of
his
position
as
a

solicitous
lover

a
doubt
if
he
were
acting
fairly
towards
one
whose

tastes
touched
his

only

rare

infrequent

his

whispered

full

eager
assurance

Do
n't
go
yet
!
Stop
till
the
hour
has
run
itself
out
;
then
I
will
not
*NL*
press
you
any
more
.
You
will
go
home
and
sleep
well
;
I
keep
sighing
*NL*
in
my
sleep
!
Do
you
ever
dream
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
recollect
a
clear
dream
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
your
face
in
every
scene
of
my
dreams
,
and
hear
your
voice
in
*NL*
every
sound
.
I
wish
I
did
not
.
It
is
too
much
what
I
feel
.
They
say
*NL*
such
love
never
lasts
.
But
it
must
!
And
yet
once
,
I
remember
,
I
saw
*NL*
an
officer
of
the
Hussars
ride
down
the
street
at
Budmouth
,
and
though
*NL*
he
was
a
total
stranger
and
never
spoke
to
me
,
I
loved
him
till
I
*NL*
thought
I
should
really
die
of
love
--
but
I
did
n't
die
,
and
at
last
I
*NL*
left
off
caring
for
him
.
How
terrible
it
would
be
if
a
time
should
*NL*
come
when
I
could
not
love
you
,
my
Clym
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
say
such
reckless
things
.
When
we
see
such
a
time
at
*NL*
hand
we
will
say
,
'
I
have
outlived
my
faith
and
purpose
,
'
and
die
.
*NL*
There
,
the
hour
has
expired
:
now
let
us
walk
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hand
in
hand
they
went
along
the
path
towards
Mistover
.
When
they
*NL*
were
near
the
house
he
said
,
``
It
is
too
late
for
me
to
see
your
*NL*
grandfather
tonight
.
Do
you
think
he
will
object
to
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
speak
to
him
.
I
am
so
accustomed
to
be
my
own
mistress
that
*NL*
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
we
should
have
to
ask
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
lingeringly
separated
,
and
Clym
descended
towards
*NL*
Blooms-End
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
walked
further
and
further
from
the
charmed
atmosphere
of
*NL*
his
Olympian
girl
his
face
grew
sad
with
a
new
sort
of
sadness
.
A
*NL*
perception
of
the
dilemma
in
which
his
love
had
placed
him
came
back
*NL*
in
full
force
.
In
spite
of
Eustacia
's
apparent
willingness
to
wait
*NL*
through
the
period
of
an
unpromising
engagement
,
till
he
should
be
*NL*
established
in
his
new
pursuit
,
he
could
not
but
perceive
at
moments
*NL*
that
she
loved
him
rather
as
a
visitant
from
a
gay
world
to
which
she
*NL*
rightly
belonged
than
as
a
man
with
a
purpose
opposed
to
that
recent
*NL*
past
of
his
which
so
interested
her
.
Often
at
their
meetings
a
word
or
*NL*
a
sigh
escaped
her
.
It
meant
that
,
though
she
made
no
conditions
as
to
*NL*
his
return
to
the
French
capital
,
this
was
what
she
secretly
longed
*NL*
for
in
the
event
of
marriage
;
and
it
robbed
him
of
many
an
otherwise
*NL*
pleasant
hour
.
Along
with
that
came
the
widening
breach
between
*NL*
himself
and
his
mother
.
Whenever
any
little
occurrence
had
brought
*NL*
into
more
prominence
than
usual
the
disappointment
that
he
was
causing
*NL*
her
it
had
sent
him
on
lone
and
moody
walks
;
or
he
was
kept
awake
*NL*
a
great
part
of
the
night
by
the
turmoil
of
spirit
which
such
a
*NL*
recognition
created
.
If
Mrs.
Yeobright
could
only
have
been
led
to
see
*NL*
what
a
sound
and
worthy
purpose
this
purpose
of
his
was
and
how
little
*NL*
it
was
being
affected
by
his
devotions
to
Eustacia
,
how
differently
*NL*
would
she
regard
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
as
his
sight
grew
accustomed
to
the
first
blinding
halo
*NL*
kindled
about
him
by
love
and
beauty
,
Yeobright
began
to
perceive
*NL*
what
a
strait
he
was
in
.
Sometimes
he
wished
that
he
had
never
*NL*
known
Eustacia
,
immediately
to
retract
the
wish
as
brutal
.
Three
*NL*
antagonistic
growths
had
to
be
kept
alive
:
his
mother
's
trust
in
him
,
*NL*
his
plan
for
becoming
a
teacher
,
and
Eustacia
's
happiness
.
His
fervid
*NL*
nature
could
not
afford
to
relinquish
one
of
these
,
though
two
of
the
*NL*
three
were
as
many
as
he
could
hope
to
preserve
.
Though
his
love
was
*NL*
as
chaste
as
that
of
Petrarch
for
his
Laura
,
it
had
made
fetters
of
*NL*
what
previously
was
only
a
difficulty
.
A
position
which
was
not
*NL*
too
simple
when
he
stood
wholehearted
had
become
indescribably
*NL*
complicated
by
the
addition
of
Eustacia
.
Just
when
his
mother
was
*NL*
beginning
to
tolerate
one
scheme
he
had
introduced
another
still
*NL*
bitterer
than
the
first
,
and
the
combination
was
more
than
she
could
*NL*
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
Sharp
Words
Are
Spoken
,
and
a
Crisis
Ensues
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Yeobright
was
not
with
Eustacia
he
was
sitting
slavishly
over
*NL*
his
books
;
when
he
was
not
reading
he
was
meeting
her
.
These
meetings
*NL*
were
carried
on
with
the
greatest
secrecy
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
his
mother
came
home
from
a
morning
visit
to
Thomasin
.
*NL*
He
could
see
from
a
disturbance
in
the
lines
of
her
face
that
*NL*
something
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
told
an
incomprehensible
thing
,
''
she
said
mournfully
.
*NL*
``
The
captain
has
let
out
at
the
Woman
that
you
and
Eustacia
Vye
are
*NL*
engaged
to
be
married

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are

said
Yeobright
.
``
But
it
may
not
be

a
very
long
*NL*
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

should
hardly
think

a
very
long

You
will
*NL*
take
her
to
Paris
,
I
suppose
?
''
She
spoke
with
weary
hopelessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
going
back
to
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
you
do
with
a
wife

then

I

told

*NL*
*NL*
``

's
incredible

place
is
overrun
with
schoolmasters

no
special
qualifications

possible
chance
is
there
for
such
as

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
chance

getting
rich

with

true

do
a

turned
to

Mrs.

remained
for

shaken

And
he
went
out
with
*NL*
tears
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
sunny
afternoon
at
the
beginning
of
summer
,
and
the
moist
*NL*
hollows
of
the
heath
had
passed
from
their
brown
to
their
green
stage
.
*NL*
Yeobright
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
basin
which
extended
down
from
*NL*
Mistover
and
Rainbarrow
.
By
this
time
he
was
calm
,
and
he
looked
*NL*
over
the
landscape
.
In
the
minor
valleys
,
between
the
hillocks
which
*NL*
diversified
the
contour
of
the
vale
,
the
fresh
young
ferns
were
*NL*
luxuriantly
growing
up
,
ultimately
to
reach
a
height
of
five
or
six
*NL*
feet
.
He
descended
a
little
way
,
flung
himself
down
in
a
spot
where
a
*NL*
path
emerged
from
one
of
the
small
hollows
,
and
waited
.
Hither
it
was
*NL*
that
he
had
promised
Eustacia
to
bring
his
mother
this
afternoon
,
that
*NL*
they
might
meet
and
be
friends
.
His
attempt
had
utterly
failed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
a
nest
of
vivid
green
.
The
ferny
vegetation
round
him
,
*NL*
though
so
abundant
,
was
quite
uniform
:
it
was
a
grove
of
machine-made
*NL*
foliage
,
a
world
of
green
triangles
with
saw-edges
,
and
not
a
single
*NL*
flower
.
The
air
was
warm
with
a
vaporous
warmth
,
and
the
stillness
*NL*
was
unbroken
.
Lizards
,
grasshoppers
,
and
ants
were
the
only
living
*NL*
things
to
be
beheld
.
The
scene
seemed
to
belong
to
the
ancient
world
*NL*
of
the
carboniferous
period
,
when
the
forms
of
plants
were
few
,
and
of
*NL*
the
fern
kind
;
when
there
was
neither
bud
nor
blossom
,
nothing
but
a
*NL*
monotonous
extent
of
leafage
,
amid
which
no
bird
sang
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
reclined
for
some
considerable
time
,
gloomily
pondering
,
*NL*
he
discerned
above
the
ferns
a
drawn
bonnet
of
white
silk
approaching
*NL*
from
the
left
,
and
Yeobright
knew
directly
that
it
covered
the
head
of
*NL*
her
he
loved
.
His
heart
awoke
from
its
apathy
to
a
warm
excitement
,
*NL*
and
,
jumping
to
his
feet
,
he
said
aloud
,
``
I
knew
she
was
sure
to
*NL*
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
vanished
in
a
hollow
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
her
whole
form
*NL*
unfolded
itself
from
the
brake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
you
here
?
''
she
exclaimed
,
with
a
disappointed
air
,
whose
*NL*
hollowness
was
proved
by
her
rising
redness
and
her
half-guilty
low
*NL*
laugh
.
``
Where
is
Mrs.
Yeobright
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
not
come
,
''
he
replied
in
a
subdued
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
had
known
that
you
would
be
here
alone
,
''
she
said
seriously
,
*NL*
``
and
that
we
were
going
to
have
such
an
idle
,
pleasant
time
as
this
.
*NL*
Pleasure
not
known
beforehand
is
half
wasted
;
to
anticipate
it
is
to
*NL*
double
it
.
I
have
not
thought
once
today
of
having
you
all
to
myself
*NL*
this
afternoon
,
and
the
actual
moment
of
a
thing
is
so
soon
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Clym
!
''
she
continued
,
looking
tenderly
into
his
face
.
``
You
are
*NL*
sad
.
Something
has
happened
at
your
home
.
Never
mind
what
is
--
let
us
*NL*
only
look
at
what
seems
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
darling
,
what
shall
we
do
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
go
on
as
we
do
now
--
just
live
on
from
meeting
to
meeting
,
*NL*
never
minding
about
another
day
.
You
,
I
know
,
are
always
thinking
of
*NL*
that
--
I
can
see
you
are
.
But
you
must
not
--
will
you
,
dear
Clym
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
just
like
all
women
.
They
are
ever
content
to
build
their
*NL*
lives
on
any
incidental
position
that
offers
itself
;
whilst
men
would
*NL*
fain
make
a
globe
to
suit
them
.
Listen
to
this
,
Eustacia
.
There
is
a
*NL*
subject
I
have
determined
to
put
off
no
longer
.
Your
sentiment
on
the
*NL*
wisdom
of
_
Carpe
diem
_
does
not
impress
me
today
.
Our
present
mode
of
*NL*
life
must
shortly
be
brought
to
an
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
your
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
.
I
love
you
none
the
less
in
telling
you
;
it
is
only
right
you
*NL*
should
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
feared
my
bliss
,
''
she
said
,
with
the
merest
motion
of
her
*NL*
lips
.
``
It
has
been
too
intense
and
consuming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
hope
yet
.
There
are
forty
years
of
work
in
me
yet
,
and
why
*NL*
should
you
despair
?
I
am
only
at
an
awkward
turning
.
I
wish
people
*NL*
would
n't
be
so
ready
to
think
that
there
is
no
progress
without
*NL*
uniformity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
your
mind
runs
off
to
the
philosophical
side
of
it
.
Well
,
these
*NL*
sad
and
hopeless
obstacles
are
welcome
in
one
sense
,
for
they
enable
*NL*
us
to
look
with
indifference
upon
the
cruel
satires
that
Fate
loves
*NL*
to
indulge
in
.
I
have
heard
of
people
,
who
,
upon
coming
suddenly
into
*NL*
happiness
,
have
died
from
anxiety
lest
they
should
not
live
to
enjoy
*NL*
it
.
I
felt
myself
in
that
whimsical
state
of
uneasiness
lately
;
but
I
*NL*
shall
be
spared
it
now
.
Let
us
walk
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
took
the
hand
which
was
already
bared
for
him
--
it
was
a
favourite
*NL*
way
with
them
to
walk
bare
hand
in
bare
hand
--
and
led
her
through
the
*NL*
ferns
.
They
formed
a
very
comely
picture
of
love
at
full
flush
,
as
*NL*
they
walked
along
the
valley
that
late
afternoon
,
the
sun
sloping
down
*NL*
on
their
right
,
and
throwing
their
thin
spectral
shadows
,
tall
as
*NL*
poplar
trees
,
far
out
across
the
furze
and
fern
.
Eustacia
went
with
*NL*
her
head
thrown
back
fancifully
,
a
certain
glad
and
voluptuous
air
of
*NL*
triumph
pervading
her
eyes
at
having
won
by
her
own
unaided
self
a
man
*NL*
who
was
her
perfect
complement
in
attainment
,
appearance
,
and
age
.
On
*NL*
the
young
man
's
part
,
the
paleness
of
face
which
he
had
brought
with
*NL*
him
from
Paris
,
and
the
incipient
marks
of
time
and
thought
,
were
*NL*
less
perceptible
than
when
he
returned
,
the
healthful
and
energetic
*NL*
sturdiness
which
was
his
by
nature
having
partially
recovered
its
*NL*
original
proportions
.
They
wandered
onward
till
they
reached
the
*NL*
nether
margin
of
the
heath
,
where
it
became
marshy
and
merged
in
*NL*
moorland
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
part
from
you
here
,
Clym
,
''
said
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
still
and
prepared
to
bid
each
other
farewell
.
Everything
*NL*
before
them
was
on
a
perfect
level
.
The
sun
,
resting
on
the
horizon
*NL*
line
,
streamed
across
the
ground
from
between
copper-coloured
and
*NL*
lilac
clouds
,
stretched
out
in
flats
beneath
a
sky
of
pale
soft
green
.
*NL*
All
dark
objects
on
the
earth
that
lay
towards
the
sun
were
overspread
*NL*
by
a
purple
haze
,
against
which
groups
of
wailing
gnats
shone
out
,
*NL*
rising
upwards
and
dancing
about
like
sparks
of
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
this
leaving
you
is
too
hard
to
bear
!
''
exclaimed
Eustacia
in
a
*NL*
sudden
whisper
of
anguish
.
``
Your
mother
will
influence
you
too
much
;
*NL*
I
shall
not
be
judged
fairly
,
it
will
get
afloat
that
I
am
not
a
good
*NL*
girl
,
and
the
witch
story
will
be
added
to
make
me
blacker
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
can
not
.
Nobody
dares
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
you
or
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
how
I
wish
I
was
sure
of
never
losing
you
--
that
you
could
not
be
*NL*
able
to
desert
me
anyhow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
stood
silent
a
moment
.
His
feelings
were
high
,
the
moment
was
*NL*
passionate
,
and
he
cut
the
knot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
be
sure
of
me
,
darling
,
''
he
said
,
folding
her
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
``
We
will
be
married
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Clym
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
agree
to
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
--
if
we
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
certainly
can
,
both
being
of
full
age
.
And
I
have
not
followed
my
*NL*
occupation
all
these
years
without
having
accumulated
money
;
and
if
*NL*
you
will
agree
to
live
in
a
tiny
cottage
somewhere
on
the
heath
,
until
*NL*
I
take
a
house
in
Budmouth
for
the
school
,
we
can
do
it
at
a
very
*NL*
little
expense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
shall
we
have
to
live
in
the
tiny
cottage
,
Clym
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
six
months
.
At
the
end
of
that
time
I
shall
have
finished
my
*NL*
reading
--
yes
,
we
will
do
it
,
and
this
heartaching
will
be
over
.
We
*NL*
shall
,
of
course
,
live
in
absolute
seclusion
,
and
our
married
life
*NL*
will
only
begin
to
outward
view
when
we
take
the
house
in
Budmouth
,
*NL*
where
I
have
already
addressed
a
letter
on
the
matter
.
Would
your
*NL*
grandfather
allow
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
would
--
on
the
understanding
that
it
should
not
last
longer
*NL*
than
six
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
guarantee
that
,
if
no
misfortune
happens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
no
misfortune
happens
,
''
she
repeated
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
is
not
likely
.
Dearest
,
fix
the
exact
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
they
consulted
on
the
question
,
and
the
day
was
chosen
.
It
*NL*
was
to
be
a
fortnight
from
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
end
of
their
talk
,
and
Eustacia
left
him
.
Clym
watched
*NL*
her
as
she
retired
towards
the
sun
.
The
luminous
rays
wrapped
her
up
*NL*
with
her
increasing
distance
,
and
the
rustle
of
her
dress
over
the
*NL*
sprouting
sedge
and
grass
died
away
.
As
he
watched
,
the
dead
flat
*NL*
of
the
scenery
overpowered
him
,
though
he
was
fully
alive
to
the
*NL*
beauty
of
that
untarnished
early
summer
green
which
was
worn
for
the
*NL*
nonce
by
the
poorest
blade
.
There
was
something
in
its
oppressive
*NL*
horizontality
which
too
much
reminded
him
of
the
arena
of
life
;
it
*NL*
gave
him
a
sense
of
bare
equality
with
,
and
no
superiority
to
,
a
*NL*
single
living
thing
under
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
was
now
no
longer
the
goddess
but
the
woman
to
him
,
a
being
*NL*
to
fight
for
,
support
,
help
,
be
maligned
for
.
Now
that
he
had
reached
*NL*
a
cooler
moment
he
would
have
preferred
a
less
hasty
marriage
;
but
*NL*
the
card
was
laid
,
and
he
determined
to
abide
by
the
game
.
Whether
*NL*
Eustacia
was
to
add
one
other
to
the
list
of
those
who
love
too
hotly
*NL*
to
love
long
and
well
,
the
forthcoming
event
was
certainly
a
ready
way
*NL*
of
proving
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
Goes
,
and
the
Breach
Is
Complete
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
evening
smart
sounds
denoting
an
active
packing
up
came
from
*NL*
Yeobright
's
room
to
the
ears
of
his
mother
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
he
departed
from
the
house
and
again
proceeded
across
the
*NL*
heath
.
A
long
day
's
march
was
before
him
,
his
object
being
to
secure
*NL*
a
dwelling
to
which
he
might
take
Eustacia
when
she
became
his
wife
.
*NL*
Such
a
house
,
small
,
secluded
,
and
with
its
windows
boarded
up
,
he
had
*NL*
casually
observed
a
month
earlier
,
about
two
miles
beyond
the
village
*NL*
of
East
Egdon
,
and
six
miles
distant
altogether
;
and
thither
he
*NL*
directed
his
steps
today
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
weather
was
far
different
from
that
of
the
evening
before
.
The
*NL*
yellow
and
vapoury
sunset
which
had
wrapped
up
Eustacia
from
his
*NL*
parting
gaze
had
presaged
change
.
It
was
one
of
those
not
infrequent
*NL*
days
of
an
English
June
which
are
as
wet
and
boisterous
as
November
.
*NL*
The
cold
clouds
hastened
on
in
a
body
,
as
if
painted
on
a
moving
*NL*
slide
.
Vapours
from
other
continents
arrived
upon
the
wind
,
which
*NL*
curled
and
parted
round
him
as
he
walked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Clym
reached
the
margin
of
a
fir
and
beech
plantation
that
*NL*
had
been
enclosed
from
heath
land
in
the
year
of
his
birth
.
Here
*NL*
the
trees
,
laden
heavily
with
their
new
and
humid
leaves
,
were
now
*NL*
suffering
more
damage
than
during
the
highest
winds
of
winter
,
*NL*
when
the
boughs
are
especially
disencumbered
to
do
battle
with
the
*NL*
storm
.
The
wet
young
beeches
were
undergoing
amputations
,
bruises
,
*NL*
cripplings
,
and
harsh
lacerations
,
from
which
the
wasting
sap
would
*NL*
bleed
for
many
a
day
to
come
,
and
which
would
leave
scars
visible
till
*NL*
the
day
of
their
burning
.
Each
stem
was
wrenched
at
the
root
,
where
*NL*
it
moved
like
a
bone
in
its
socket
,
and
at
every
onset
of
the
gale
*NL*
convulsive
sounds
came
from
the
branches
,
as
if
pain
were
felt
.
In
a
*NL*
neighbouring
brake
a
finch
was
trying
to
sing
;
but
the
wind
blew
under
*NL*
his
feathers
till
they
stood
on
end
,
twisted
round
his
little
tail
,
*NL*
and
made
him
give
up
his
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
a
few
yards
to
Yeobright
's
left
,
on
the
open
heath
,
how
*NL*
ineffectively
gnashed
the
storm
!
Those
gusts
which
tore
the
trees
*NL*
merely
waved
the
furze
and
heather
in
a
light
caress
.
Egdon
was
made
*NL*
for
such
times
as
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
reached
the
empty
house
about
mid-day
.
It
was
almost
as
*NL*
lonely
as
that
of
Eustacia
's
grandfather
,
but
the
fact
that
it
stood
*NL*
near
a
heath
was
disguised
by
a
belt
of
firs
which
almost
enclosed
*NL*
the
premises
.
He
journeyed
on
about
a
mile
further
to
the
village
*NL*
in
which
the
owner
lived
,
and
,
returning
with
him
to
the
house
,
*NL*
arrangements
were
completed
,
and
the
man
undertook
that
one
room
at
*NL*
least
should
be
ready
for
occupation
the
next
day
.
Clym
's
intention
*NL*
was
to
live
there
alone
until
Eustacia
should
join
him
on
their
*NL*
wedding
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turned
to
pursue
his
way
homeward
through
the
drizzle
that
had
*NL*
so
greatly
transformed
the
scene
.
The
ferns
,
among
which
he
had
lain
*NL*
in
comfort
yesterday
,
were
dripping
moisture
from
every
frond
,
wetting
*NL*
his
legs
through
as
he
brushed
past
;
and
the
fur
of
the
rabbits
*NL*
leaping
before
him
was
clotted
into
dark
locks
by
the
same
watery
*NL*
surrounding
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
home
damp
and
weary
enough
after
his
ten-mile
walk
.
It
*NL*
had
hardly
been
a
propitious
beginning
,
but
he
had
chosen
his
course
,
*NL*
and
would
show
no
swerving
.
The
evening
and
the
following
morning
*NL*
were
spent
in
concluding
arrangements
for
his
departure
.
To
stay
at
*NL*
home
a
minute
longer
than
necessary
after
having
once
come
to
his
*NL*
determination
would
be
,
he
felt
,
only
to
give
new
pain
to
his
mother
*NL*
by
some
word
,
look
,
or
deed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hired
a
conveyance
and
sent
off
his
goods
by
two
o'clock
that
*NL*
day
.
The
next
step
was
to
get
some
furniture
,
which
,
after
serving
*NL*
for
temporary
use
in
the
cottage
,
would
be
available
for
the
house
*NL*
at
Budmouth
when
increased
by
goods
of
a
better
description
.
A
mart
*NL*
extensive
enough
for
the
purpose
existed
at
Anglebury
,
some
miles
*NL*
beyond
the
spot
chosen
for
his
residence
,
and
there
he
resolved
to
*NL*
pass
the
coming
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
now
only
remained
to
wish
his
mother
good-bye
.
She
was
sitting
by
*NL*
the
window
as
usual
when
he
came
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
I
am
going
to
leave
you
,
''
he
said
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
,
by
your
packing
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Yeobright
in
a
*NL*
voice
from
which
every
particle
of
emotion
was
painfully
excluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
part
friends
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
Clym
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
be
married
on
the
twenty-fifth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
going
to
be
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
--
and
then
you
must
come
and
see
us
.
You
will
understand
me
*NL*
better
after
that
,
and
our
situation
will
not
be
so
wretched
as
it
is
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
it
likely
I
shall
come
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
will
not
be
my
fault
or
Eustacia
's
,
mother
.
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
cheek
,
and
departed
in
great
misery
,
which
was
several
*NL*
hours
in
lessening
itself
to
a
controllable
level
.
The
position
had
*NL*
been
such
that
nothing
more
could
be
said
without
,
in
the
first
place
,
*NL*
breaking
down
a
barrier
;
and
that
was
not
to
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
had
Yeobright
gone
from
his
mother
's
house
than
her
face
*NL*
changed
its
rigid
aspect
for
one
of
blank
despair
.
After
a
while
she
*NL*
wept
,
and
her
tears
brought
some
relief
.
During
the
rest
of
the
day
*NL*
she
did
nothing
but
walk
up
and
down
the
garden
path
in
a
state
*NL*
bordering
on
stupefaction
.
Night
came
,
and
with
it
but
little
rest
.
*NL*
The
next
day
,
with
an
instinct
to
do
something
which
should
reduce
*NL*
prostration
to
mournfulness
,
she
went
to
her
son
's
room
,
and
with
her
*NL*
own
hands
arranged
it
in
order
,
for
an
imaginary
time
when
he
should
*NL*
return
again
.
She
gave
some
attention
to
her
flowers
,
but
it
was
*NL*
perfunctorily
bestowed
,
for
they
no
longer
charmed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
relief
when
,
early
in
the
afternoon
,
Thomasin
paid
*NL*
her
an
unexpected
visit
.
This
was
not
the
first
meeting
between
the
*NL*
relatives
since
Thomasin
's
marriage
;
and
past
blunders
having
been
*NL*
in
a
rough
way
rectified
,
they
could
always
greet
each
other
with
*NL*
pleasure
and
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
oblique
band
of
sunlight
which
followed
her
through
the
door
*NL*
became
the
young
wife
well
.
It
illuminated
her
as
her
presence
*NL*
illuminated
the
heath
.
In
her
movements
,
in
her
gaze
,
she
reminded
*NL*
the
beholder
of
the
feathered
creatures
who
lived
around
her
home
.
*NL*
All
similes
and
allegories
concerning
her
began
and
ended
with
birds
.
*NL*
There
was
as
much
variety
in
her
motions
as
in
their
flight
.
When
she
*NL*
was
musing
she
was
a
kestrel
,
which
hangs
in
the
air
by
an
invisible
*NL*
motion
of
its
wings
.
When
she
was
in
a
high
wind
her
light
body
was
*NL*
blown
against
trees
and
banks
like
a
heron
's
.
When
she
was
frightened
*NL*
she
darted
noiselessly
like
a
kingfisher
.
When
she
was
serene
she
*NL*
skimmed
like
a
swallow
,
and
that
is
how
she
was
moving
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
looking
very
blithe
,
upon
my
word
,
Tamsie
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Yeobright
,
with
a
sad
smile
.
``
How
is
Damon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
kind
to
you
,
Thomasin
?
''
And
Mrs.
Yeobright
observed
her
*NL*
narrowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
fairly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
honestly
said
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
aunt
.
I
would
tell
you
if
he
were
unkind
.
''
She
added
,
blushing
,
*NL*
and
with
hesitation
,
``
He
--
I
do
n't
know
if
I
ought
to
complain
to
you
*NL*
about
this
,
but
I
am
not
quite
sure
what
to
do
.
I
want
some
money
,
*NL*
you
know
,
aunt
--
some
to
buy
little
things
for
myself
--
and
he
does
n't
*NL*
give
me
any
.
I
do
n't
like
to
ask
him
;
and
yet
,
perhaps
,
he
does
n't
*NL*
give
it
me
because
he
does
n't
know
.
Ought
I
to
mention
it
to
him
,
*NL*
aunt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
ought
.
Have
you
never
said
a
word
on
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
had
some
of
my
own
,
''
said
Thomasin
evasively
,
``
and
I
have
*NL*
not
wanted
any
of
his
until
lately
.
I
did
just
say
something
about
it
*NL*
last
week
;
but
he
seems
--
not
to
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
be
made
to
remember
.
You
are
aware
that
I
have
a
little
box
*NL*
full
of
spade-guineas
,
which
your
uncle
put
into
my
hands
to
divide
*NL*
between
yourself
and
Clym
whenever
I
chose
.
Perhaps
the
time
has
come
*NL*
when
it
should
be
done
.
They
can
be
turned
into
sovereigns
at
any
*NL*
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
should
like
to
have
my
share

that
is
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall

if
necessary

But
it
is
only
proper
that
you
should
first
*NL*
tell
your
husband
distinctly
that
you
are
without
any
,
and
see
what
he
*NL*
will
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

I
will

Aunt

I
have
heard
about
Clym

I
know
you
are
*NL*
in
trouble
about
him
,
and
that
's
why
I
have
come

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
turned
away
,
and
her
features
worked
in
her
attempt
to
*NL*
conceal
her
feelings
.
Then
she
ceased
to
make
any
attempt
,
and
said
,
*NL*
weeping
,
``
O
Thomasin
,
do
you
think
he
hates
me
?
How
can
he
bear
to
*NL*
grieve
me
so
,
when
I
have
lived
only
for
him
through
all
these
years
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hate
you
--
no
,
''
said
Thomasin
soothingly
.
``
It
is
only
that
he
loves

her
too
well

Look
at
it
quietly

do

It

not
so
very
bad
of
him

*NL*
Do
you
know

I
thought
it
not
the
worst
match
he
could
have
made

Miss
Vye

family
is
a
good
one
on
her
mother
's
side
;
and
her
father
*NL*
was
a
romantic
wanderer
--
a
sort
of
Greek
Ulysses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
no

Thomasin

it
is
no
use

Your

good

*NL*
I
will
not
trouble
you
to
argue
.
I
have
gone
through
the
whole
that
*NL*
can
be
said
on
either
side
times
,
and
many
times
.
Clym
and
I
have
*NL*
not
parted
in
anger
;
we
have
parted
in
a
worse
way

It
is
not
a
*NL*
passionate
quarrel
that
would
have
broken
my
heart

it
is
the
steady
*NL*
opposition

persistence
in
going
wrong
that
he
has
shown

tender

kind

up

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are

many
better

that

the
agony

it

It
was

Thomasin
,
and
she
only
,
who
led
your
husband
to
act
as
he
did
:
I
would
*NL*
swear
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
Thomasin
eagerly
.
``
It
was
before
he
knew
me
that
he

it
was
nothing
but
a
mere
flirtation

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

we
will
let
it
be
so

There
is
little
use

unravelling

that
now

Sons
must
be
blind

they
will

Why
is
it
that
a

from

distance

can
not

close

Clym
must
do
as

he
will

he
is
nothing
more
to
me

And
this
is
maternity

to
give
*NL*
one
's
best
years
and
best
love
to
ensure
the
fate
of
being
despised

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
unyielding

Think
how
many
mothers
there
are
whose
sons

have
brought
them
to
public
shame
by
real
crimes
before
you
feel
so
*NL*
deeply
a
case

this

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomasin
,
do
n't
lecture
me

ca
n't
have
it

It
is
the
excess
above
*NL*
what
we
expect
that
makes
the
force
of
the
blow
,
and
that
may
not
*NL*
be
greater
in
their
case
than
in
mine
:
they
may
have
foreseen
the

worst

I
am
wrongly

she
added

with
a
mournful

smile

``
Some
widows
can
guard
against
the
wounds
their
children
give
*NL*
them
by
turning
their
hearts

beginning
life
*NL*
again

But
I
always
was
a
poor

weak
,
one-idea
'd
creature
--
I
had
not
*NL*
the
compass
of
heart
nor
the
enterprise
for
that

Just
as
forlorn
and
*NL*
stupefied
as
I
was
when
my
husband
's
spirit
flew
away
I
have
sat
ever
*NL*
since
--
never
attempting
to
mend
matters
at
all

I
was
comparatively
a
*NL*
young
woman
then
,
and
I
might
have
had
another
family
by
this
time
,
*NL*

have
been
comforted
by

for
the
failure
of
this
one

come

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
for
one
week
Thomasin
literally
fulfilled
her
word
.
She
*NL*
endeavoured
to
make
light
of
the
wedding
;
and
brought
news
of
the
*NL*
preparations
,
and
that
she
was
invited
to
be
present
.
The
next
week
*NL*
she
was
rather
unwell
,
and
did
not
appear
.
Nothing
had
as
yet
been
*NL*
done
about
the
guineas
,
for
Thomasin
feared
to
address
her
husband
*NL*
again
on
the
subject
,
and
Mrs.
Yeobright
had
insisted
upon
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
just
before
this
time
Wildeve
was
standing
at
the
door
of
*NL*
the
Quiet
Woman
.
In
addition
to
the
upward
path
through
the
heath
to
*NL*
Rainbarrow
and
Mistover
,
there
was
a
road
which
branched
from
the
*NL*
highway
a
short
distance
below
the
inn
,
and
ascended
to
Mistover
by
a
*NL*
circuitous
and
easy
incline
.
This
was
the
only
route
on
that
side
for
*NL*
vehicles
to
the
captain
's
retreat
.
A
light
cart
from
the
nearest
town
*NL*
descended
the
road
,
and
the
lad
who
was
driving
pulled
up
in
front
of
*NL*
the
inn
for
something
to
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
from
Mistover
?
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
They
are
taking
in
good
things
up
there
.
Going
to
be
a
*NL*
wedding
.
''
And
the
driver
buried
his
face
in
his
mug
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
had
not
received
an
inkling
of
the
fact
before
,
and
a
sudden
*NL*
expression
of
pain
overspread
his
face
.
He
turned
for
a
moment
into
*NL*
the
passage
to
hide
it
.
Then
he
came
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
Miss
Vye
?
''
he
said
.
``
How
is
it
--
that
she
can
be
married
*NL*
so
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
will
of
God
and
a
ready
young
man
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
Mr.
Yeobright
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

He
has
been
creeping
about
with
her
all
the
spring

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
--
she
was
immensely
taken
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
crazy
about
him
,
so
their
general
servant
of
all
work
tells
*NL*
me
.
And
that
lad
Charley
that
looks
after
the
horse
is
all
in
a
daze
*NL*
about
it
.
The
stun-poll
has
got
fondlike
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
lively
--
is
she
glad

Going
to
be
married
so
soon
--
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
so
very
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
not
so
very
soon

''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
went
indoors
to
the
empty
room
,
a
curious
heartache
within
*NL*
him
.
He
rested
his
elbow
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
his
face
upon
his
*NL*
hand
.
When
Thomasin
entered
the
room
he
did
not
tell
her
of
what
*NL*
he
had
heard
.
The
old
longing
for
Eustacia
had
reappeared
in
his
*NL*
soul
;
and
it
was
mainly
because
he
had
discovered
that
it
was
another
*NL*
man
's
intention
to
possess
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
yearning
for
the
difficult
,
to
be
weary
of
that
offered
;
to
care
*NL*
for
the
remote
,
to
dislike
the
near
;
it
was
Wildeve
's
nature
always
.
*NL*
This
is
the
true
mark
of
the
man
of
sentiment
.
Though
Wildeve
's
*NL*
fevered
feeling
had
not
been
elaborated
to
real
poetical
compass
,
it
*NL*
was
of
the
standard
sort
.
He
might
have
been
called
the
Rousseau
of
*NL*
Egdon
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
Morning
and
the
Evening
of
a
Day
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
wedding
morning
came
.
Nobody
would
have
imagined
from
appearances
*NL*
that
Blooms-End
had
any
interest
in
Mistover
that
day
.
A
solemn
*NL*
stillness
prevailed
around
the
house
of
Clym
's
mother
,
and
there
*NL*
was
no
more
animation
indoors
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
who
had
declined
to
*NL*
attend
the
ceremony
,
sat
by
the
breakfast
table
in
the
old
room
which
*NL*
communicated
immediately
with
the
porch
,
her
eyes
listlessly
directed
*NL*
towards
the
open
door
.
It
was
the
room
in
which
,
six
months
earlier
,
*NL*
the
merry
Christmas
party
had
met
,
to
which
Eustacia
came
secretly
and
*NL*
as
a
stranger
.
The
only
living
thing
that
entered
now
was
a
sparrow
;
*NL*
and
seeing
no
movements
to
cause
alarm
,
he
hopped
boldly
round
the
*NL*
room
,
endeavoured
to
go
out
by
the
window
,
and
fluttered
among
the
*NL*
pot-flowers
.
This
roused
the
lonely
sitter
,
who
got
up
,
released
*NL*
the
bird
,
and
went
to
the
door
.
She
was
expecting
Thomasin
,
who
had
*NL*
written
the
night
before
to
state
that
the
time
had
come
when
she
*NL*
would
wish
to
have
the
money
,
and
that
she
would
if
possible
call
this
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Thomasin
occupied
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
thoughts
but
slightly
as
she
*NL*
looked
up
the
valley
of
the
heath
,
alive
with
butterflies
,
and
with
*NL*
grasshoppers
whose
husky
noises
on
every
side
formed
a
whispered
*NL*
chorus
.
A
domestic
drama
,
for
which
the
preparations
were
now
being
*NL*
made
a
mile
or
two
off
,
was
but
little
less
vividly
present
to
her
*NL*
eyes
than
if
enacted
before
her
.
She
tried
to
dismiss
the
vision
,
and
*NL*
walked
about
the
garden
plot
;
but
her
eyes
ever
and
anon
sought
out
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
parish
church
to
which
Mistover
belonged
,
and
*NL*
her
excited
fancy
clove
the
hills
which
divided
the
building
from
*NL*
her
eyes
.
The
morning
wore
away
.
Eleven
o'clock
struck
:
could
it
*NL*
be
that
the
wedding
was
then
in
progress
?
It
must
be
so
.
She
went
*NL*
on
imagining
the
scene
at
the
church
,
which
he
had
by
this
time
*NL*
approached
with
his
bride
.
She
pictured
the
little
group
of
children
*NL*
by
the
gate
as
the
pony-carriage
drove
up
in
which
,
as
Thomasin
had
*NL*
learnt
,
they
were
going
to
perform
the
short
journey
.
Then
she
saw
*NL*
them
enter
and
proceed
to
the
chancel
and
kneel
;
and
the
service
*NL*
seemed
to
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
.
``
O
,
it
is
a
mistake
!
''
she
*NL*
groaned
.
``
And
he
will
rue
it
some
day
,
and
think
of
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
remained
thus
,
overcome
by
her
forebodings
,
the
old
clock
*NL*
indoors
whizzed
forth
twelve
strokes
.
Soon
after
,
faint
sounds
floated
*NL*
to
her
ear
from
afar
over
the
hills
.
The
breeze
came
from
that
*NL*
quarter
,
and
it
had
brought
with
it
the
notes
of
distant
bells
,
gaily
*NL*
starting
off
in
a
peal
:
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
.
The
ringers
at
*NL*
East
Egdon
were
announcing
the
nuptials
of
Eustacia
and
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
over
,
''
she
murmured
.
``
Well
,
well
!
and
life
too
will
be
*NL*
over
soon
.
And
why
should
I
go
on
scalding
my
face
like
this
?
Cry
*NL*
about
one
thing
in
life
,
cry
about
all
;
one
thread
runs
through
the
*NL*
whole
piece
.
And
yet
we
say
,
'
a
time
to
laugh
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
evening
Wildeve
came
.
Since
Thomasin
's
marriage
Mrs.
Yeobright
*NL*
had
shown
towards
him
that
grim
friendliness
which
at
last
arises
in
*NL*
all
such
cases
of
undesired
affinity
.
The
vision
of
what
ought
to
*NL*
have
been
is
thrown
aside
in
sheer
weariness
,
and
browbeaten
human
*NL*
endeavour
listlessly
makes
the
best
of
the
fact
that
is
.
Wildeve
,
to
*NL*
do
him
justice
,
had
behaved
very
courteously
to
his
wife
's
aunt
;
and
*NL*
it
was
with
no
surprise
that
she
saw
him
enter
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomasin
has
not
been
able
to
come
,
as
she
promised
to
do
,
''
he
*NL*
replied
to
her
inquiry
,
which
had
been
anxious
,
for
she
knew
that
*NL*
her
niece
was
badly
in
want
of
money
.
``
The
captain
came
down
last
*NL*
night
and
personally
pressed
her
to
join
them
today
.
So
,
not
to
be
*NL*
unpleasant
,
she
determined
to
go
.
They
fetched
her
in
the
pony-chaise
,
*NL*
and
are
going
to
bring
her
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
done
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
``
Have
they
gone
to
their
new
*NL*
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
have
had
no
news
from
Mistover
since
Thomasin
left
*NL*
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
not
go
with
her
?
''
said
she
,
as
if
there
might
be
good
reasons
*NL*
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
,
''
said
Wildeve
,
reddening
slightly
.
``
We
could
not
both
*NL*
leave
the
house
;
it
was
rather
a
busy
morning
,
on
account
of
Anglebury
*NL*
Great
Market
.
I
believe
you
have
something
to
give
to
Thomasin
?
If
*NL*
you
like
,
I
will
take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
hesitated
,
and
wondered
if
Wildeve
knew
what
the
*NL*
something
was
.
``
Did
she
tell
you
of
this
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
particularly
.
She
casually
dropped
a
remark
about
having
*NL*
arranged
to
fetch
some
article
or
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
hardly
necessary
to
send
it
.
She
can
have
it
whenever
she
*NL*
chooses
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
wo
n't
be
yet
.
In
the
present
state
of
her
health
she
must
not
*NL*
go
on
walking
so
much
as
she
has
done
.
''
He
added
,
with
a
faint
twang
*NL*
of
sarcasm
,
``
What
wonderful
thing
is
it
that
I
can
not
be
trusted
to
*NL*
take
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
worth
troubling
you
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
would
think
you
doubted
my
honesty
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
laugh
,
*NL*
though
his
colour
rose
in
a
quick
resentfulness
frequent
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
think
no
such
thing
,
''
said
she
drily
.
``
It
is
simply
that
*NL*
I
,
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
world
,
feel
that
there
are
certain
*NL*
things
which
had
better
be
done
by
certain
people
than
by
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like
,
as
you
like
,
''
said
Wildeve
laconically
.
``
It
is
not
*NL*
worth
arguing
about
.
Well
,
I
think
I
must
turn
homeward
again
,
as
the
*NL*
inn
must
not
be
left
long
in
charge
of
the
lad
and
the
maid
only
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
his
way
,
his
farewell
being
scarcely
so
courteous
as
his
*NL*
greeting
.
But
Mrs.
Yeobright
knew
him
thoroughly
by
this
time
,
and
*NL*
took
little
notice
of
his
manner
,
good
or
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Wildeve
was
gone
Mrs.
Yeobright
stood
and
considered
what
would
*NL*
be
the
best
course
to
adopt
with
regard
to
the
guineas
,
which
she
had
*NL*
not
liked
to
entrust
to
Wildeve
.
It
was
hardly
credible
that
Thomasin
*NL*
had
told
him
to
ask
for
them
,
when
the
necessity
for
them
had
arisen
*NL*
from
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
money
at
his
hands
.
At
the
same
time
*NL*
Thomasin
really
wanted
them
,
and
might
be
unable
to
come
to
Blooms-End
*NL*
for
another
week
at
least
.
To
take
or
send
the
money
to
her
at
the
*NL*
inn
would
be
impolite
,
since
Wildeve
would
pretty
surely
be
present
,
*NL*
or
would
discover
the
transaction
;
and
if
,
as
her
aunt
suspected
,
he
*NL*
treated
her
less
kindly
than
she
deserved
to
be
treated
,
he
might
then
*NL*
get
the
whole
sum
out
of
her
gentle
hands
.
But
on
this
particular
*NL*
evening
Thomasin
was
at
Mistover
,
and
anything
might
be
conveyed
to
*NL*
her
there
without
the
knowledge
of
her
husband
.
Upon
the
whole
the
*NL*
opportunity
was
worth
taking
advantage
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
son
,
too
,
was
there
,
and
was
now
married
.
There
could
be
no
more
*NL*
proper
moment
to
render
him
his
share
of
the
money
than
the
present
.
*NL*
And
the
chance
that
would
be
afforded
her
,
by
sending
him
this
gift
,
*NL*
of
showing
how
far
she
was
from
bearing
him
ill-will
,
cheered
the
sad
*NL*
mother
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
upstairs
and
took
from
a
locked
drawer
a
little
box
,
out
of
*NL*
which
she
poured
a
hoard
of
broad
unworn
guineas
that
had
lain
there
*NL*
many
a
year
.
There
were
a
hundred
in
all
,
and
she
divided
them
into
*NL*
two
heaps
,
fifty
in
each
.
Tying
up
these
in
small
canvas
bags
,
she
*NL*
went
down
to
the
garden
and
called
to
Christian
Cantle
,
who
was
*NL*
loitering
about
in
hope
of
a
supper
which
was
not
really
owed
him
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
gave
him
the
moneybags
,
charged
him
to
go
to
Mistover
,
*NL*
and
on
no
account
to
deliver
them
into
any
one
's
hands
save
her
son
's
*NL*
and
Thomasin
's
.
On
further
thought
she
deemed
it
advisable
to
tell
*NL*
Christian
precisely
what
the
two
bags
contained
,
that
he
might
*NL*
be
fully
impressed
with
their
importance
.
Christian
pocketed
the
*NL*
money-bags
,
promised
the
greatest
carefulness
,
and
set
out
on
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
hurry
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
``
It
will
be
better
not
to
*NL*
get
there
till
after
dusk
,
and
then
nobody
will
notice
you
.
Come
back
*NL*
here
to
supper
,
if
it
is
not
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
nine
o'clock
when
he
began
to
ascend
the
vale
towards
*NL*
Mistover
;
but
the
long
days
of
summer
being
at
their
climax
,
the
first
*NL*
obscurity
of
evening
had
only
just
begun
to
tan
the
landscape
.
At
*NL*
this
point
of
his
journey
Christian
heard
voices
,
and
found
that
they
*NL*
proceeded
from
a
company
of
men
and
women
who
were
traversing
a
hollow
*NL*
ahead
of
him
,
the
tops
only
of
their
heads
being
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
and
thought
of
the
money
he
carried
.
It
was
almost
too
*NL*
early
even
for
Christian
seriously
to
fear
robbery
;
nevertheless
he
*NL*
took
a
precaution
which
ever
since
his
boyhood
he
had
adopted
whenever
*NL*
he
carried
more
than
two
or
three
shillings
upon
his
person
--
a
*NL*
precaution
somewhat
like
that
of
the
owner
of
the
Pitt
Diamond
when
*NL*
filled
with
similar
misgivings
.
He
took
off
his
boots
,
untied
the
*NL*
guineas
,
and
emptied
the
contents
of
one
little
bag
into
the
right
*NL*
boot
,
and
of
the
other
into
the
left
,
spreading
them
as
flatly
as
*NL*
possible
over
the
bottom
of
each
,
which
was
really
a
spacious
coffer
*NL*
by
no
means
limited
to
the
size
of
the
foot
.
Pulling
them
on
again
*NL*
and
lacing
them
to
the
very
top
,
he
proceeded
on
his
way
,
more
easy
*NL*
in
his
head
than
under
his
soles
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
path
converged
towards
that
of
the
noisy
company
,
and
on
coming
*NL*
nearer
he
found
to
his
relief
that
they
were
several
Egdon
people
whom
*NL*
he
knew
very
well
,
while
with
them
walked
Fairway
,
of
Blooms-End
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Christian
going
too
?
''
said
Fairway
as
soon
as
he
recognized
the
*NL*
newcomer
.
``
You
've
got
no
young
woman
nor
wife
to
your
name
to
gie
a
*NL*
gown-piece
to

I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
d'ye
mean
?
''
said
Christian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
raffle
.
The
one
we
go
to
every
year
.
Going
to
the
raffle
*NL*
as
well
as
ourselves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
knew
a
word

Is
it

cudgel-playing
or
other
sportful

forms

I
do
n't
want
to
go
,
thank
you
,
Mister
Fairway
,
*NL*
and
no

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
a
buxom
woman
.
``
There
's
no
danger
at
all

Christian

*NL*
Every
man
puts
in
a
shilling
apiece
,

wins
a
gown-piece
for

his

if

got
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

as
that
's
not
my
fortune
there
's
no
meaning
in
it
to

But
I

should
like
to
see
the
fun
,
if
there
's
nothing
of
the
black
art
in
it

*NL*
and
if
a
man
may
look
on
without
cost
or
getting
into
any
dangerous
*NL*
wrangle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
will
be
no
uproar
at
all
,

said
Timothy
.
``
Sure
,
Christian
,
if
*NL*
you
'd
like
to
come
we
'll
see
there
's
no

*NL*
*NL*
``

if
so

it
*NL*
would
be
setting

a
bad
example

is
so
light
moral

But
*NL*
a
gown-piece
for
a
shilling

no

't
is
worth
looking
*NL*
in

half
an
hour

Yes
,
I
'll
come
,
*NL*
if
you
'll
step
a
little
way
towards
Mistover
with
me
afterwards
,
*NL*
supposing

should
have
closed
in
,
and
nobody
else
is
going
that
*NL*
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
or
two
promised
;
and
Christian
,
diverging
from
his
direct
path
,
*NL*
turned
round
to
the
right
with
his
companions
towards
the
Quiet
Woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
entered
the
large
common
room
of
the
inn
they
found
*NL*
assembled
there
about
ten
men
from
among
the
neighbouring
population
,
*NL*
and
the
group
was
increased
by
the
new
contingent
to
double
that
*NL*
number
.
Most
of
them
were
sitting
round
the
room
in
seats
divided
by
*NL*
wooden
elbows
like
those
of
crude
cathedral
stalls
,
which
were
carved
*NL*
with
the
initials
of
many
an
illustrious
drunkard
of
former
times
who
*NL*
had
passed
his
days
and
his
nights
between
them
,
and
now
lay
as
an
*NL*
alcoholic
cinder
in
the
nearest
churchyard
.
Among
the
cups
on
the
*NL*
long
table
before
the
sitters
lay
an
open
parcel
of
light
drapery
--
the
*NL*
gown-piece
,
as
it
was
called
--
which
was
to
be
raffled
for
.
Wildeve
*NL*
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
smoking
a
cigar
;
and
the
*NL*
promoter
of
the
raffle
,
a
packman
from
a
distant
town
,
was
expatiating
*NL*
upon
the
value
of
the
fabric
as
material
for
a
summer
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
gentlemen
,
''
he
continued
,
as
the
newcomers
drew
up
to
the
table
,
*NL*
``
there
's
five
have
entered
,
and
we
want
four
more
to
make
up
the
*NL*
number
.
I
think
,
by
the
faces
of
those
gentlemen
who
have
just
come
*NL*
in
,
that
they
are
shrewd
enough
to
take
advantage
of
this
rare
*NL*
opportunity
of
beautifying
their
ladies
at
a
very
trifling
expense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fairway
,
Sam
,
and
another
placed
their
shillings
on
the
table
,
and
the
*NL*
man
turned
to
Christian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
Christian
,
drawing
back
,
with
a
quick
gaze
of
*NL*
misgiving
.
``
I
am
only
a
poor
chap
come
to
look
on
,
an
it
please
ye
,
*NL*
sir
.
I
do
n't
so
much
as
know
how
you
do
it
.
If
so
be
I
was
sure
of
*NL*
getting
it
I
would
put
down
the
shilling
;
but
I
could
n't
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
might
almost
be
sure
,
''
said
the
pedlar
.
``
In
fact
,
now
I
*NL*
look
into
your
face
,
even
if
I
ca
n't
say
you
are
sure
to
win
,
I
can
*NL*
say
that
I
never
saw
anything
look
more
like
winning
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
anyhow
have
the
same
chance
as
the
rest
of
us
,
''
said
Sam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
extra
luck
of
being
the
last
comer
,
''
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
was
born
wi
'
a
caul
,
and
perhaps
can
be
no
more
ruined
than
*NL*
drowned
?
''
Christian
added
,
beginning
to
give
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ultimately
Christian
laid
down
his
shilling
,
the
raffle
began
,
and
*NL*
the
dice
went
round
.
When
it
came
to
Christian
's
turn
he
took
the
box
*NL*
with
a
trembling
hand
,
shook
it
fearfully
,
and
threw
a
pair-royal
.
*NL*
Three
of
the
others
had
thrown
common
low
pairs
,
and
all
the
rest
mere
*NL*
points
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentleman
looked
like
winning
,
as
I
said
,
''
observed
the
chapman
*NL*
blandly
.
``
Take
it
,
sir
;
the
article
is
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Haw-haw-haw
!
''
said
Fairway
.
``
I
'm
damned
if
this
is
n't
the
quarest
*NL*
start
that
ever
I
knowed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
?
''
asked
Christian
,
with
a
vacant
stare
from
his
target
eyes
.
*NL*
``
I
--
I
have
n't
got
neither
maid
,
wife
,
nor
widder
belonging
to
me
at
*NL*
all

and
I
'm
afeard
it
will
make
me
laughed
at
to
ha'e
it
,
Master
*NL*
Traveller
.
What
with
being
curious
to
join
in
I
never
thought
of
that
!
*NL*
What
shall
I
do
wi

a
woman
's
clothes
in
my
bedroom
,
and
not
lose
my
*NL*
decency
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
'em
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Fairway
,
``
if
it
is
only
for
luck

*NL*
Perhaps
`
twill
tempt
some
woman
that
thy
poor
carcase
had
no
power
*NL*
over
when
standing
empty-handed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
it
,
certainly
,
''
said
Wildeve
,
who
had
idly
watched
the
scene
*NL*
from
a
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
table
was
then
cleared
of
the
articles
,
and
the
men
began
to
*NL*
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
be
sure
!
''
said
Christian
,
half
to
himself
.
``
To
think
I
*NL*
should
have
been
born
so
lucky
as
this
,
and
not
have
found
it
out
*NL*
until
now
!
What
curious
creatures
these
dice
be
--
powerful
rulers
of
*NL*
us
all
,
and
yet
at
my
command
!
I
am
sure
I
never
need
be
afeared
of
*NL*
anything
after
this
.
''
He
handled
the
dice
fondly
one
by
one
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
he
said
in
a
confidential
whisper
to
Wildeve
,
who
was
near
his
*NL*
left
hand
,
``
if
I
could
only
use
this
power
that
's
in
me
of
multiplying
*NL*
money
I
might
do
some
good
to
a
near
relation
of
yours
,
seeing
what
*NL*
I
've
got
about
me
of
hers
--
eh
?
''
He
tapped
one
of
his
money-laden
boots
*NL*
upon
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
secret
.
Well
,
I
must
be
going
now
.
''
He
looked
anxiously
*NL*
towards
Fairway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
Wildeve
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Mistover
Knap
.
I
have
to
see
Mrs.
Thomasin
there
--
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
there
,
too
,
to
fetch
Mrs.
Wildeve
.
We
can
walk
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
became
lost
in
thought
,
and
a
look
of
inward
illumination
came
*NL*
into
his
eyes
.
It
was
money
for
his
wife
that
Mrs.
Yeobright
could
*NL*
not
trust
him
with
.
``
Yet
she
could
trust
this
fellow
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
.
``
Why
does
n't
that
which
belongs
to
the
wife
belong
to
the
*NL*
husband
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
called
to
the
pot-boy
to
bring
him
his
hat
,
and
said
,
``
Now
,
*NL*
Christian
,
I
am
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wildeve
,
''
said
Christian
timidly
,
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
,
*NL*
``
would
you
mind
lending
me
them
wonderful
little
things
that
carry
my
*NL*
luck
inside
'em
,
that
I
might
practise
a
bit
by
myself
,
you
know
?
''
He
*NL*
looked
wistfully
at
the
dice
and
box
lying
on
the
mantlepiece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Wildeve
carelessly
.
``
They
were
only
cut
out
by
some
*NL*
lad
with
his
knife
,
and
are
worth
nothing
.
''
And
Christian
went
back
*NL*
and
privately
pocketed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
.
The
night
was
warm
and
*NL*
cloudy
.
``
By
Gad
!
't
is
dark
,
''
he
continued
.
``
But
I
suppose
we
shall
*NL*
find
our
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
should
lose
the
path
it
might
be
awkward
,
''
said
Christian
.
``
A
*NL*
lantern
is
the
only
shield
that
will
make
it
safe
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
have
a
lantern
by
all
means
.
''
The
stable
lantern
was
fetched
*NL*
and
lighted
.
Christian
took
up
his
gownpiece
,
and
the
two
set
out
to
*NL*
ascend
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
the
room
the
men
fell
into
chat
till
their
attention
was
for
a
*NL*
moment
drawn
to
the
chimney-corner
.
This
was
large
,
and
,
in
addition
*NL*
to
its
proper
recess
,
contained
within
its
jambs
,
like
many
on
*NL*
Egdon
,
a
receding
seat
,
so
that
a
person
might
sit
there
absolutely
*NL*
unobserved
,
provided
there
was
no
fire
to
light
him
up
,
as
was
the
*NL*
case
now
and
throughout
the
summer
.
From
the
niche
a
single
object
*NL*
protruded
into
the
light
from
the
candles
on
the
table
.
It
was
a
clay
*NL*
pipe
,
and
its
colour
was
reddish
.
The
men
had
been
attracted
to
this
*NL*
object
by
a
voice
behind
the
pipe
asking
for
a
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
life
,
it
fairly
startled
me
when
the
man
spoke
!
''
said
*NL*
Fairway
,
handing
a
candle
.
``
Oh
--
't
is
the
reddleman
!
You
've
kept
a
*NL*
quiet
tongue
,
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
had
nothing
to
say
,
''
observed
Venn
.
In
a
few
minutes
he
arose
*NL*
and
wished
the
company
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Wildeve
and
Christian
had
plunged
into
the
heath
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
stagnant
,
warm
,
and
misty
night
,
full
of
all
the
heavy
*NL*
perfumes
of
new
vegetation
not
yet
dried
by
hot
sun
,
and
among
*NL*
these
particularly
the
scent
of
the
fern
.
The
lantern
,
dangling
*NL*
from
Christian
's
hand
,
brushed
the
feathery
fronds
in
passing
by
,
*NL*
disturbing
moths
and
other
winged
insects
,
which
flew
out
and
alighted
*NL*
upon
its
horny
panes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
have
money
to
carry
to
Mrs.
Wildeve
?
''
said
Christian
's
*NL*
companion
,
after
a
silence
.
``
Do
n't
you
think
it
very
odd
that
it
*NL*
should
n't
be
given
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
man
and
wife
be
one
flesh
,
`
twould
have
been
all
the
same
,
I
*NL*
should
think
,
''
said
Christian
.
``
But
my
strict
documents
was
,
to
give
*NL*
the
money
into
Mrs.
Wildeve
's
hand
--
and
't
is
well
to
do
things
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
Any
person
who
had
known
the
circumstances
*NL*
might
have
perceived
that
Wildeve
was
mortified
by
the
discovery
that
*NL*
the
matter
in
transit
was
money
,
and
not
,
as
he
had
supposed
when
at
*NL*
Blooms-End
,
some
fancy
nick-nack
which
only
interested
the
two
women
*NL*
themselves
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
refusal
implied
that
his
honour
was
not
*NL*
considered
to
be
of
sufficiently
good
quality
to
make
him
a
safer
*NL*
bearer
of
his
wife
's
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
warm
it
is
tonight
,
Christian
!
''
he
said
,
panting
,
when
they
*NL*
were
nearly
under
Rainbarrow
.
``
Let
us
sit
down
for
a
few
minutes
,
for
*NL*
Heaven
's
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
flung
himself
down
on
the
soft
ferns
;
and
Christian
,
placing
*NL*
the
lantern
and
parcel
on
the
ground
,
perched
himself
in
a
cramped
*NL*
position
hard
by
,
his
knees
almost
touching
his
chin
.
He
presently
*NL*
thrust
one
hand
into
his
coat-pocket
and
began
shaking
it
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
rattling
in
there
?
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
the
dice
,
sir
,
''
said
Christian
,
quickly
withdrawing
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
What
magical
machines
these
little
things
be
,
Mr.
Wildeve
!
'T
is
a
*NL*
game
I
should
never
get
tired
of
.
Would
you
mind
my
taking
'em
out
*NL*
and
looking
at
'em
for
a
minute
,
to
see
how
they
are
made
?
I
did
n't
*NL*
like
to
look
close
before
the
other
men
,
for
fear
they
should
think
it
*NL*
bad
manners
in
me
.
''
Christian
took
them
out
and
examined
them
in
the
*NL*
hollow
of
his
hand
by
the
lantern
light
.
``
That
these
little
things
*NL*
should
carry
such
luck

such
charm

such
a
spell

such
*NL*
power
in
'em

passes
all
I
ever
heard

zeed

''
he
went
on
,
with
a
*NL*
fascinated
gaze
at
the
dice
,
which
,
as
is
frequently
the
case
in
*NL*
country
places
,
were
made
of
wood
,
the
points
being
burnt
upon
each
*NL*
face
with
the
end
of
a
wire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
a
great
deal

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

then

Now
is
your

Christian

and
I
would
*NL*
recommend
you
not
to
let
it
slip

Some
men
are
born
to

I
belong

the
latter
class

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
know
anybody
who
was
born
to
it
besides
myself
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes

I
once
heard
of
an
Italian
,
who
sat
down
at
a
gaming
table
*NL*
with
only
a
louis
-LRB-
that
's
a
foreign
sovereign
-RRB-
in
his
pocket
.
He
*NL*
played
on
for
twenty-four
hours
,
and
won
ten
thousand
pounds
,
*NL*
stripping
the
bank
he
had
played
against
.
Then
there
was
another
man
*NL*
who
had
lost
a
thousand
pounds
,
and
went
to
the
broker
's
next
day
to
*NL*
sell
stock
,
that
he
might
pay
the
debt
.
The
man
to
whom
he
owed
the
*NL*
money
went
with
him
in
a
hackney-coach
;
and
to
pass
the
time
they
*NL*
tossed
who
should
pay
the
fare
.
The
ruined
man
won
,
and
the
other
was
*NL*
tempted
to
continue
the
game
,
and
they
played
all
the
way
.
When
the
*NL*
coachman
stopped
he
was
told
to
drive
home
again
:
the
whole
thousand
*NL*
pounds
had
been
won
back
by
the
man
who
was
going
to
sell
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha

splendid
!

exclaimed
Christian

``
Go
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
was
a
man
of
London
,
who
was
only
a
waiter
at
White
's
*NL*
clubhouse
.
He
began
playing
first
half-crown
stakes
,
and
then
higher
*NL*
and
higher
,
till
he
became
very
rich
,
got
an
appointment
in
India
,

and
rose
to

His

married

the

stood

had
*NL*
lost
his
last
dollar
.
He
staked
his
watch
and
chain
,
and
lost
as
*NL*
before
;
staked
his
umbrella
,
lost
again
;
staked
his
hat
,
lost
again
;
*NL*
staked
his
coat
and
stood
in
his
shirt-sleeve
;
lost
again
.
Began
*NL*
taking
off
his
breeches
,
and
then
a
looker-on
gave
him
a
trifle
for
*NL*
his
pluck
.
With
this
he
won
.
Won
back
his
coat
,
won
back
his
hat
,
*NL*
won
back
his
umbrella
,
his
watch
,
his
money
,
and
went
out
of
the
door
*NL*
a
rich
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
't
is
too
good
--
it
takes
away
my
breath
!
Mr.
Wildeve
,
I
think
*NL*
I
will
try
another
shilling
with
you
,
as
I
am
one
of
that
sort
;
no
*NL*
danger
can
come
o
`
t
,
and
you
can
afford
to
lose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Wildeve
,
rising
.
Searching
about
with
the
lantern
,
*NL*
he
found
a
large
flat
stone
,
which
he
placed
between
himself
and
*NL*
Christian
,
and
sat
down
again
.
The
lantern
was
opened
to
give
more
*NL*
light
,
and
it
's
rays
directed
upon
the
stone
.
Christian
put
down
*NL*
a
shilling
,
Wildeve
another
,
and
each
threw
.
Christian
won
.
They
*NL*
played
for
two
,
Christian
won
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
try
four
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
They
played
for
four
.
This
time
the
*NL*
stakes
were
won
by
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
those
little
accidents
will
,
of
course
,
sometimes
happen
,
to
the
*NL*
luckiest
man
,
''
he
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
I
have
no
more
money
!
''
explained
Christian
excitedly
.
``
And
*NL*
yet
,
if
I
could
go
on
,
I
should
get
it
back
again
,
and
more
.
I
wish
*NL*
this
was
mine
.
''
He
struck
his
boot
upon
the
ground
,
so
that
the
*NL*
guineas
chinked
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
have
not
put
Mrs.
Wildeve
's
money
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
'T
is
for
safety
.
Is
it
any
harm
to
raffle
with
a
married
lady
's
*NL*
money
when
,
if
I
win
,
I
shall
only
keep
my
winnings
,
and
give
her
her
*NL*
own
all
the
same
;
and
if
t
`
other
man
wins
,
her
money
will
go
to
the
*NL*
lawful
owner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
had
been
brooding
ever
since
they
started
on
the
mean
*NL*
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
by
his
wife
's
friends
;
and
it
cut
his
*NL*
heart
severely
.
As
the
minutes
passed
he
had
gradually
drifted
into
a
*NL*
revengeful
intention
without
knowing
the
precise
moment
of
forming
it
.
*NL*
This
was
to
teach
Mrs.
Yeobright
a
lesson
,
as
he
considered
it
to
be
;
*NL*
in
other
words
,
to
show
her
if
he
could
,
that
her
niece
's
husband
was
*NL*
the
proper
guardian
of
her
niece
's
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
goes
!
''
said
Christian
,
beginning
to
unlace
one
boot
.
``
I
*NL*
shall
dream
of
it
nights
and
nights
,
I
suppose
;
but
I
shall
always
*NL*
swear
my
flesh
do
n't
crawl
when
I
think
o
`
t
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thrust
his
hand
into
the
boot
and
withdrew
one
of
poor
Thomasin
's
*NL*
precious
guineas
,
piping
hot
.
Wildeve
had
already
placed
a
sovereign
*NL*
on
the
stone
.
The
game
was
then
resumed
.
Wildeve
won
first
,
and
*NL*
Christian
ventured
another
,
winning
himself
this
time
.
The
game
*NL*
fluctuated
,
but
the
average
was
in
Wildeve
's
favour
.
Both
men
became
*NL*
so
absorbed
in
the
game
that
they
took
no
heed
of
anything
but
the
*NL*
pigmy
objects
immediately
beneath
their
eyes
,
the
flat
stone
,
the
open
*NL*
lantern
,
the
dice
,
and
the
few
illuminated
fern-leaves
which
lay
under
*NL*
the
light
,
were
the
whole
world
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Christian
lost
rapidly
;
and
presently
,
to
his
horror
,
the
*NL*
whole
fifty
guineas
belonging
to
Thomasin
had
been
handed
over
to
his
*NL*
adversary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
--
I
do
n't
care
!
''
he
moaned
,
and
desperately
set
about
*NL*
untying
his
left
boot
to
get
at
the
other
fifty
.
``
The
devil
will
toss
*NL*
me
into
the
flames
on
his
three-pronged
fork
for
this
night
's
work
,
*NL*
I
know
!
But
perhaps
I
shall
win
yet
,
and
then
I
'll
get
a
wife
to
sit
*NL*
up
with
me
o
'
nights
,
and
I
wo
n't
be
afeard
,
I
wo
n't
!
Here
's
another
*NL*
for
`
ee
,
my
man
!
''
He
slapped
another
guinea
down
upon
the
stone
,
and
*NL*
the
dice-box
was
rattled
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
passed
on
.
Wildeve
began
to
be
as
excited
as
Christian
himself
.
*NL*
When
commencing
the
game
his
intention
had
been
nothing
further
than
*NL*
a
bitter
practical
joke
on
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
To
win
the
money
,
fairly
*NL*
or
otherwise
,
and
to
hand
it
contemptuously
to
Thomasin
in
her
aunt
's
*NL*
presence
,
had
been
the
dim
outline
of
his
purpose
.
But
men
are
drawn
*NL*
from
their
intentions
even
in
the
course
of
carrying
them
out
,
and
*NL*
it
was
extremely
doubtful
,
by
the
time
the
twentieth
guinea
had
been
*NL*
reached
,
whether
Wildeve
was
conscious
of
any
other
intention
than
*NL*
that
of
winning
for
his
own
personal
benefit
.
Moreover
,
he
was
now
no
*NL*
longer
gambling
for
his
wife
's
money
,
but
for
Yeobright
's
;
though
of
*NL*
this
fact
Christian
,
in
his
apprehensiveness
,
did
not
inform
him
till
*NL*
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
eleven
o'clock
,
when
,
with
almost
a
shriek
,
Christian
*NL*
placed
Yeobright
's
last
gleaming
guinea
upon
the
stone
.
In
thirty
*NL*
seconds
it
had
gone
the
way
of
its
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Christian
turned
and
flung
himself
on
the
ferns
in
a
convulsion
of
*NL*
remorse
,
``
O
,
what
shall
I
do
with
my
wretched
self
?
''
he
groaned
.
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
do
?
Will
any
good
Heaven
hae
mercy
upon
my
wicked
*NL*
soul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
?
Live
on
just
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
live
on
just
the
same
!
I
'll
die
!
I
say
you
are
a

a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
sharper
than
my
neighbour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
man
sharper
than
my
neighbour
;
a
regular
sharper
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
chips-in-porridge
,
you
are
very
unmannerly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
that
!
And
I
say
you
be
unmannerly
!
You
've
got
*NL*
money
that
is
n't
your
own
.
Half
the
guineas
are
poor
Mr.
Clym
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
had
to
gie
fifty
of
'em
to
him
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
said
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
?
...
Well
,
`
twould
have
been
more
graceful
of
her
to
have
given
*NL*
them
to
his
wife
Eustacia
.
But
they
are
in
my
hands
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Christian
pulled
on
his
boots
,
and
with
heavy
breathings
,
which
could
*NL*
be
heard
to
some
distance
,
dragged
his
limbs
together
,
arose
,
and
*NL*
tottered
away
out
of
sight
.
Wildeve
set
about
shutting
the
lantern
to
*NL*
return
to
the
house
,
for
he
deemed
it
too
late
to
go
to
Mistover
to
*NL*
meet
his
wife
,
who
was
to
be
driven
home
in
the
captain
's
four-wheel
.
*NL*
While
he
was
closing
the
little
horn
door
a
figure
rose
from
behind
a
*NL*
neighbouring
bush
and
came
forward
into
the
lantern
light
.
It
was
the
*NL*
reddleman
approaching
.

*NL*
*NL*
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
A
New
Force
Disturbs
the
Current
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
stared
.
Venn
looked
coolly
towards
Wildeve
,
and
,
without
a
*NL*
word
being
spoken
,
he
deliberately
sat
himself
down
where
Christian
*NL*
had
been
seated
,
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
drew
out
a
*NL*
sovereign
,
and
laid
it
on
the
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
watching
us
from
behind
that
bush
?
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
nodded
.
``
Down
with
your
stake
,
''
he
said
.
``
Or
have
n't
*NL*
you
pluck
enough
to
go
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
gambling
is
a
species
of
amusement
which
is
much
more
easily
*NL*
begun
with
full
pockets
than
left
off
with
the
same
;
and
though
*NL*
Wildeve
in
a
cooler
temper
might
have
prudently
declined
this
*NL*
invitation
,
the
excitement
of
his
recent
success
carried
him
*NL*
completely
away
.
He
placed
one
of
the
guineas
on
a
slab
beside
the
*NL*
reddleman
's
sovereign
.
``
Mine
is
a
guinea
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
guinea
that
's
not
your
own
,
''
said
Venn
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
own
,
''
answered
Wildeve
haughtily
.
``
It
is
my
wife
's
,
and
*NL*
what
is
hers
is
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
let
's
make
a
beginning
.
''
He
shook
the
box
,
and
threw
*NL*
eight
,
ten
,
and
nine
;
the
three
casts
amounted
to
twenty-seven
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
encouraged
Wildeve
.
He
took
the
box
;
and
his
three
casts
*NL*
amounted
to
forty-five
.
*NL*
*NL*
Down
went
another
of
the
reddleman
's
sovereigns
against
his
first
one
*NL*
which
Wildeve
laid
.
This
time
Wildeve
threw
fifty-one
points
,
but
no
*NL*
pair
.
The
reddleman
looked
grim
,
threw
a
raffle
of
aces
,
and
pocketed
*NL*
the
stakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
again
,
''
said
Wildeve
contemptuously
.
``
Double
the
*NL*
stakes
.
''
He
laid
two
of
Thomasin
's
guineas
,
and
the
reddleman
his
two
*NL*
pounds
.
Venn
won
again
.
New
stakes
were
laid
on
the
stone
,
and
the
*NL*
gamblers
proceeded
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
was
a
nervous
and
excitable
man
,
and
the
game
was
beginning
*NL*
to
tell
upon
his
temper
.
He
writhed
,
fumed
,
shifted
his
seat
;
and
*NL*
the
beating
of
his
heart
was
almost
audible
.
Venn
sat
with
lips
*NL*
impassively
closed
and
eyes
reduced
to
a
pair
of
unimportant
twinkles
;
*NL*
he
scarcely
appeared
to
breathe
.
He
might
have
been
an
Arab
,
or
an
*NL*
automaton
;
he
would
have
been
like
a
red
sandstone
statue
but
for
the
*NL*
motion
of
his
arm
with
the
dice-box
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
game
fluctuated
,
now
in
favour
of
one
,
now
in
favour
of
the
other
,
*NL*
without
any
great
advantage
on
the
side
of
either
.
Nearly
twenty
*NL*
minutes
were
passed
thus
.
The
light
of
the
candle
had
by
this
time
*NL*
attracted
heathflies
,
moths
,
and
other
winged
creatures
of
night
,
*NL*
which
floated
round
the
lantern
,
flew
into
the
flame
,
or
beat
about
*NL*
the
faces
of
the
two
players
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
neither
of
the
men
paid
much
attention
to
these
things
,
their
eyes
*NL*
being
concentrated
upon
the
little
flat
stone
,
which
to
them
was
an
*NL*
arena
vast
and
important
as
a
battlefield
.
By
this
time
a
change
had
*NL*
come
over
the
game
;
the
reddleman
won
continually
.
At
length
sixty
*NL*
guineas
--
Thomasin
's
fifty
,
and
ten
of
Clym
's
--
had
passed
into
his
*NL*
hands
.
Wildeve
was
reckless
,
frantic
,
exasperated
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Won
back
his
coat
,
'
''
said
Venn
slily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
throw
,
and
the
money
went
the
same
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Won
back
his
hat
,
'
''
continued
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
oh
!
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Won
back
his
watch
,
won
back
his
money
,
and
went
out
of
the
door
*NL*
a
rich
man
,
'
''
added
Venn
sentence
by
sentence
,
as
stake
after
stake
*NL*
passed
over
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
more
!
''
shouted
Wildeve
,
dashing
down
the
money
.
``
And
three
*NL*
casts
be
hanged
--
one
shall
decide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
red
automaton
opposite
lapsed
into
silence
,
nodded
,
and
followed
*NL*
his
example
.
Wildeve
rattled
the
box
,
and
threw
a
pair
of
sixes
and
*NL*
five
points
.
He
clapped
his
hands
;
``
I
have
done
it
this
*NL*
time
--
hurrah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
two
playing
,
and
only
one
has
thrown
,
''
said
the
reddleman
,
*NL*
quietly
bringing
down
the
box
.
The
eyes
of
each
were
then
so
intently
*NL*
converged
upon
the
stone
that
one
could
fancy
their
beams
were
*NL*
visible
,
like
rays
in
a
fog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
lifted
the
box
,
and
behold
a
triplet
of
sixes
was
disclosed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
was
full
of
fury
.
While
the
reddleman
was
grasping
the
stakes
*NL*
Wildeve
seized
the
dice
and
hurled
them
,
box
and
all
,
into
the
*NL*
darkness
,
uttering
a
fearful
imprecation
.
Then
he
arose
and
began
*NL*
stamping
up
and
down
like
a
madman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
over
,
then
?
''
said
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
cried
Wildeve
.
``
I
mean
to
have
another
chance
yet
.
I
*NL*
must
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
good
man
,
what
have
you
done
with
the
dice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
threw
them
away
--
it
was
a
momentary
irritation
.
What
a
fool
I
am
!
*NL*
Here
--
come
and
help
me
to
look
for
them
--
we
must
find
them
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
snatched
up
the
lantern
and
began
anxiously
prowling
among
the
*NL*
furze
and
fern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
likely
to
find
them
there
,
''
said
Venn
,
following
.
``
What
*NL*
did
you
do
such
a
crazy
thing
as
that
for
?
Here
's
the
box
.
The
dice
*NL*
ca
n't
be
far
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
turned
the
light
eagerly
upon
the
spot
where
Venn
had
found
*NL*
the
box
,
and
mauled
the
herbage
right
and
left
.
In
the
course
of
a
few
*NL*
minutes
one
of
the
dice
was
found
.
They
searched
on
for
some
time
,
*NL*
but
no
other
was
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
said
Wildeve
;
``
let
's
play
with
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agreed
,
''
said
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Down
they
sat
again
,
and
recommenced
with
single
guinea
stakes
;
and
*NL*
the
play
went
on
smartly
.
But
Fortune
had
unmistakably
fallen
in
love
*NL*
with
the
reddleman
tonight
.
He
won
steadily
,
till
he
was
the
owner
of
*NL*
fourteen
more
of
the
gold
pieces
.
Seventy-nine
of
the
hundred
guineas
*NL*
were
his
,
Wildeve
possessing
only
twenty-one
.
The
aspect
of
the
two
*NL*
opponents
was
now
singular
.
Apart
from
motions
,
a
complete
diorama
*NL*
of
the
fluctuations
of
the
game
went
on
in
their
eyes
.
A
diminutive
*NL*
candle-flame
was
mirrored
in
each
pupil
,
and
it
would
have
been
*NL*
possible
to
distinguish
therein
between
the
moods
of
hope
and
the
*NL*
moods
of
abandonment
,
even
as
regards
the
reddleman
,
though
his
facial
*NL*
muscles
betrayed
nothing
at
all
.
Wildeve
played
on
with
the
*NL*
recklessness
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
he
suddenly
exclaimed
,
hearing
a
rustle
;
and
they
both
*NL*
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
surrounded
by
dusky
forms
between
four
and
five
feet
high
,
*NL*
standing
a
few
paces
beyond
the
rays
of
the
lantern
.
A
moment
's
*NL*
inspection
revealed
that
the
encircling
figures
were
heath-croppers
,
*NL*
their
heads
being
all
towards
the
players
,
at
whom
they
gazed
*NL*
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoosh
!
''
said
Wildeve
,
and
the
whole
forty
or
fifty
animals
at
once
*NL*
turned
and
galloped
away
.
Play
was
again
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
minutes
passed
away
.
Then
a
large
death
's
head
moth
advanced
from
*NL*
the
obscure
outer
air
,
wheeled
twice
round
the
lantern
,
flew
straight
*NL*
at
the
candle
,
and
extinguished
it
by
the
force
of
the
blow
.
Wildeve
*NL*
had
just
thrown
,
but
had
not
lifted
the
box
to
see
what
he
had
cast
;
*NL*
and
now
it
was
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
infernal
!
''
he
shrieked
.
``
Now
,
what
shall
we
do
?
Perhaps
I
*NL*
have
thrown
six
--
have
you
any
matches
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
,
''
said
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christian
had
some
--
I
wonder
where
he
is
.
Christian
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
reply
to
Wildeve
's
shout
,
save
a
mournful
whining
*NL*
from
the
herons
which
were
nesting
lower
down
the
vale
.
Both
men
*NL*
looked
blankly
round
without
rising
.
As
their
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
*NL*
the
darkness
they
perceived
faint
greenish
points
of
light
among
the
*NL*
grass
and
fern
.
These
lights
dotted
the
hillside
like
stars
of
a
low
*NL*
magnitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
glowworms
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
``
Wait
a
minute
.
We
can
continue
the
*NL*
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
sat
still
,
and
his
companion
went
hither
and
thither
till
he
had
*NL*
gathered
thirteen
glowworms
--
as
many
as
he
could
find
in
a
space
of
*NL*
four
or
five
minutes
--
upon
a
foxglove
leaf
which
he
pulled
for
the
*NL*
purpose
.
The
reddleman
vented
a
low
humorous
laugh
when
he
saw
his
*NL*
adversary
return
with
these
.
``
Determined
to
go
on
,
then
?
''
he
said
*NL*
drily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
am
!
''
said
Wildeve
angrily
.
And
shaking
the
glowworms
from
*NL*
the
leaf
he
ranged
them
with
a
trembling
hand
in
a
circle
on
the
*NL*
stone
,
leaving
a
space
in
the
middle
for
the
descent
of
the
dice-box
,
*NL*
over
which
the
thirteen
tiny
lamps
threw
a
pale
phosphoric
shine
.
The
*NL*
game
was
again
renewed
.
It
happened
to
be
that
season
of
the
year
at
*NL*
which
glowworms
put
forth
their
greatest
brilliancy
,
and
the
light
*NL*
they
yielded
was
more
than
ample
for
the
purpose
,
since
it
is
possible
*NL*
on
such
nights
to
read
the
handwriting
of
a
letter
by
the
light
of
two
*NL*
or
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
incongruity
between
the
men
's
deeds
and
their
environment
was
*NL*
great
.
Amid
the
soft
juicy
vegetation
of
the
hollow
in
which
they
*NL*
sat
,
the
motionless
and
the
uninhabited
solitude
,
intruded
the
chink
*NL*
of
guineas
,
the
rattle
of
dice
,
the
exclamations
of
the
reckless
*NL*
players
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
had
lifted
the
box
as
soon
as
the
lights
were
obtained
,
and
*NL*
the
solitary
die
proclaimed
that
the
game
was
still
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
play
any
more
--
you
've
been
tampering
with
the
dice
,
''
he
*NL*
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
--
when
they
were
your
own
?
''
said
the
reddleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
change
the
game
:
the
lowest
point
shall
win
the
stake
--
it
may
*NL*
cut
off
my
ill
luck
.
Do
you
refuse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
go
on
,
''
said
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
there
they
are
again
--
damn
them
!
''
cried
Wildeve
,
looking
up
.
The
*NL*
heath-croppers
had
returned
noiselessly
,
and
were
looking
on
with
*NL*
erect
heads
just
as
before
,
their
timid
eyes
fixed
upon
the
scene
,
as
*NL*
if
they
were
wondering
what
mankind
and
candle-light
could
have
to
do
*NL*
in
these
haunts
at
this
untoward
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
plague
those
creatures
are
--
staring
at
me
so
!
''
he
said
,
and
*NL*
flung
a
stone
,
which
scattered
them
;
when
the
game
was
continued
as
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
had
now
ten
guineas
left
;
and
each
laid
five
.
Wildeve
threw
*NL*
three
points
;
Venn
two
,
and
raked
in
the
coins
.
The
other
seized
the
*NL*
die
,
and
clenched
his
teeth
upon
it
in
sheer
rage
,
as
if
he
would
*NL*
bite
it
in
pieces
.
``
Never
give
in
--
here
are
my
last
five
!
''
he
cried
,
*NL*
throwing
them
down
.
``
Hang
the
glowworms
--
they
are
going
out
.
Why
*NL*
do
n't
you
burn
,
you
little
fools
?
Stir
them
up
with
a
thorn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
probed
the
glowworms
with
a
bit
of
stick
,
and
rolled
them
over
,
*NL*
till
the
bright
side
of
their
tails
was
upwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
light
enough
.
Throw
on
,
''
said
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
brought
down
the
box
within
the
shining
circle
and
looked
*NL*
eagerly
.
He
had
thrown
ace
.
``
Well
done
!
--
I
said
it
would
turn
,
and
*NL*
it
has
turned
.
''
Venn
said
nothing
;
but
his
hand
shook
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
ace
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
''
said
Wildeve
.
``
Curse
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
die
smacked
the
stone
a
second
time
.
It
was
ace
again
.
Venn
*NL*
looked
gloomy
,
threw
:
the
die
was
seen
to
be
lying
in
two
pieces
,
*NL*
the
cleft
sides
uppermost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
thrown
nothing
at
all
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Serves
me
right
--
I
split
the
die
with
my
teeth
.
Here
--
take
your
*NL*
money
.
Blank
is
less
than
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wish
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
,
I
say
--
you
've
won
it
!
''
And
Wildeve
threw
the
stakes
against
*NL*
the
reddleman
's
chest
.
Venn
gathered
them
up
,
arose
,
and
withdrew
*NL*
from
the
hollow
,
Wildeve
sitting
stupefied
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
come
to
himself
he
also
arose
,
and
,
with
the
extinguished
*NL*
lantern
in
his
hand
,
went
towards
the
high-road
.
On
reaching
it
he
*NL*
stood
still
.
The
silence
of
night
pervaded
the
whole
heath
except
in
*NL*
one
direction
;
and
that
was
towards
Mistover
.
There
he
could
hear
the
*NL*
noise
of
light
wheels
,
and
presently
saw
two
carriage-lamps
descending
*NL*
the
hill
.
Wildeve
screened
himself
under
a
bush
and
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vehicle
came
on
and
passed
before
him
.
It
was
a
hired
carriage
,
*NL*
and
behind
the
coachman
were
two
persons
whom
he
knew
well
.
There
sat
*NL*
Eustacia
and
Yeobright
,
the
arm
of
the
latter
being
round
her
waist
.
*NL*
They
turned
the
sharp
corner
at
the
bottom
towards
the
temporary
home
*NL*
which
Clym
had
hired
and
furnished
,
about
five
miles
to
the
eastward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
forgot
the
loss
of
the
money
at
the
sight
of
his
lost
*NL*
love
,
whose
preciousness
in
his
eyes
was
increasing
in
geometrical
*NL*
progression
with
each
new
incident
that
reminded
him
of
their
hopeless
*NL*
division
.
Brimming
with
the
subtilized
misery
that
he
was
capable
of
*NL*
feeling
,
he
followed
the
opposite
way
towards
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
same
moment
that
Wildeve
stepped
into
the
highway
Venn
also
*NL*
had
reached
it
at
a
point
a
hundred
yards
further
on
;
and
he
,
hearing
*NL*
the
same
wheels
,
likewise
waited
till
the
carriage
should
come
up
.
*NL*
When
he
saw
who
sat
therein
he
seemed
to
be
disappointed
.
Reflecting
*NL*
a
minute
or
two
,
during
which
interval
the
carriage
rolled
on
,
he
*NL*
crossed
the
road
,
and
took
a
short
cut
through
the
furze
and
heath
to
*NL*
a
point
where
the
turnpike-road
bent
round
in
ascending
a
hill
.
He
*NL*
was
now
again
in
front
of
the
carriage
,
which
presently
came
up
at
a
*NL*
walking
pace
.
Venn
stepped
forward
and
showed
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
started
when
the
lamp
shone
upon
him
,
and
Clym
's
arm
was
*NL*
involuntarily
withdrawn
from
her
waist
.
He
said
,
``
What
,
Diggory
?
You
*NL*
are
having
a
lonely
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
beg
your
pardon
for
stopping
you
,
''
said
Venn
.
``
But
I
am
*NL*
waiting
about
for
Mrs.
Wildeve
:
I
have
something
to
give
her
from
Mrs.
*NL*
Yeobright
.
Can
you
tell
me
if
she
's
gone
home
from
the
party
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
But
she
will
be
leaving
soon
.
You
may
possibly
meet
her
at
the
*NL*
corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
made
a
farewell
obeisance
,
and
walked
back
to
his
former
*NL*
position
,
where
the
by-road
from
Mistover
joined
the
highway
.
Here
*NL*
he
remained
fixed
for
nearly
half
an
hour
,
and
then
another
pair
*NL*
of
lights
came
down
the
hill
.
It
was
the
old-fashioned
wheeled
*NL*
nondescript
belonging
to
the
captain
,
and
Thomasin
sat
in
it
alone
,
*NL*
driven
by
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddleman
came
up
as
they
slowly
turned
the
corner
.
``
I
beg
pardon
*NL*
for
stopping
you
,
Mrs.
Wildeve
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
I
have
something
to
*NL*
give
you
privately
from
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
''
He
handed
a
small
parcel
;
it
*NL*
consisted
of
the
hundred
guineas
he
had
just
won
,
roughly
twisted
up
*NL*
in
a
piece
of
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
recovered
from
her
surprise
,
and
took
the
packet
.
``
That
's
*NL*
all
,
ma'am
--
I
wish
you
good
night
,
''
he
said
,
and
vanished
from
her
*NL*
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Venn
,
in
his
anxiety
to
rectify
matters
,
had
placed
in
Thomasin
's
*NL*
hands
not
only
the
fifty
guineas
which
rightly
belonged
to
her
,
but
*NL*
also
the
fifty
intended
for
her
cousin
Clym
.
His
mistake
had
been
*NL*
based
upon
Wildeve
's
words
at
the
opening
of
the
game
,
when
he
*NL*
indignantly
denied
that
the
guinea
was
not
his
own
.
It
had
not
been
*NL*
comprehended
by
the
reddleman
that
at
half-way
through
the
performance
*NL*
the
game
was
continued
with
the
money
of
another
person
;
and
it
was
an
*NL*
error
which
afterwards
helped
to
cause
more
misfortune
than
treble
the
*NL*
loss
in
money
value
could
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
now
somewhat
advanced
;
and
Venn
plunged
deeper
into
the
*NL*
heath
,
till
he
came
to
a
ravine
where
his
van
was
standing
--
a
spot
not
*NL*
more
than
two
hundred
yards
from
the
site
of
the
gambling
bout
.
He
*NL*
entered
this
movable
home
of
his
,
lit
his
lantern
,
and
,
before
closing
*NL*
his
door
for
the
night
,
stood
reflecting
on
the
circumstances
of
*NL*
the
preceding
hours
.
While
he
stood
the
dawn
grew
visible
in
the
*NL*
north-east
quarter
of
the
heavens
,
which
,
the
clouds
having
cleared
*NL*
off
,
was
bright
with
a
soft
sheen
at
this
midsummer
time
,
though
it
*NL*
was
only
between
one
and
two
o'clock
.
Venn
,
thoroughly
weary
,
then
*NL*
shut
his
door
and
flung
himself
down
to
sleep
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
July
sun
shone
over
Egdon
and
fired
its
crimson
heather
to
*NL*
scarlet
.
It
was
the
one
season
of
the
year
,
and
the
one
weather
of
*NL*
the
season
,
in
which
the
heath
was
gorgeous
.
This
flowering
period
*NL*
represented
the
second
or
noontide
division
in
the
cycle
of
those
*NL*
superficial
changes
which
alone
were
possible
here
;
it
followed
the
*NL*
green
or
young-fern
period
,
representing
the
morn
,
and
preceded
the
*NL*
brown
period
,
when
the
heathbells
and
ferns
would
wear
the
russet
*NL*
tinges
of
evening
;
to
be
in
turn
displaced
by
the
dark
hue
of
the
*NL*
winter
period
,
representing
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
and
Eustacia
,
in
their
little
house
at
Alderworth
,
beyond
East
*NL*
Egdon
,
were
living
on
with
a
monotony
which
was
delightful
to
them
.
*NL*
The
heath
and
changes
of
weather
were
quite
blotted
out
from
their
*NL*
eyes
for
the
present
.
They
were
enclosed
in
a
sort
of
luminous
mist
,
*NL*
which
hid
from
them
surroundings
of
any
inharmonious
colour
,
and
*NL*
gave
to
all
things
the
character
of
light
.
When
it
rained
they
were
*NL*
charmed
,
because
they
could
remain
indoors
together
all
day
with
such
*NL*
a
show
of
reason
;
when
it
was
fine
they
were
charmed
,
because
they
*NL*
could
sit
together
on
the
hills
.
They
were
like
those
double
stars
*NL*
which
revolve
round
and
round
each
other
,
and
from
a
distance
appear
*NL*
to
be
one
.
The
absolute
solitude
in
which
they
lived
intensified
*NL*
their
reciprocal
thoughts
;
yet
some
might
have
said
that
it
had
the
*NL*
disadvantage
of
consuming
their
mutual
affections
at
a
fearfully
*NL*
prodigal
rate
.
Yeobright
did
not
fear
for
his
own
part
;
but
*NL*
recollection
of
Eustacia
's
old
speech
about
the
evanescence
of
love
,
*NL*
now
apparently
forgotten
by
her
,
sometimes
caused
him
to
ask
himself
*NL*
a
question
;
and
he
recoiled
at
the
thought
that
the
quality
of
*NL*
finiteness
was
not
foreign
to
Eden
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
three
or
four
weeks
had
been
passed
thus
,
Yeobright
resumed
*NL*
his
reading
in
earnest
.
To
make
up
for
lost
time
he
studied
*NL*
indefatigably
,
for
he
wished
to
enter
his
new
profession
with
the
*NL*
least
possible
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Eustacia
's
dream
had
always
been
that
,
once
married
to
Clym
,
*NL*
she
would
have
the
power
of
inducing
him
to
return
to
Paris
.
He
had
*NL*
carefully
withheld
all
promise
to
do
so
;
but
would
he
be
proof
against
*NL*
her
coaxing
and
argument
?
She
had
calculated
to
such
a
degree
on
*NL*
the
probability
of
success
that
she
had
represented
Paris
,
and
not
*NL*
Budmouth
,
to
her
grandfather
as
in
all
likelihood
their
future
home
.
*NL*
Her
hopes
were
bound
up
in
this
dream
.
In
the
quiet
days
since
their
*NL*
marriage
,
when
Yeobright
had
been
poring
over
her
lips
,
her
eyes
,
and
*NL*
the
lines
of
her
face
,
she
had
mused
and
mused
on
the
subject
,
even
*NL*
while
in
the
act
of
returning
his
gaze
;
and
now
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
books
,
indicating
a
future
which
was
antagonistic
to
her
dream
,
struck
*NL*
her
with
a
positively
painful
jar
.
She
was
hoping
for
the
time
when
,
*NL*
as
the
mistress
of
some
pretty
establishment
,
however
small
,
near
a
*NL*
Parisian
Boulevard
,
she
would
be
passing
her
days
on
the
skirts
at
*NL*
least
of
the
gay
world
,
and
catching
stray
wafts
from
those
town
*NL*
pleasures
she
was
so
well
fitted
to
enjoy
.
Yet
Yeobright
was
as
firm
*NL*
in
the
contrary
intention
as
if
the
tendency
of
marriage
were
rather
*NL*
to
develop
the
fantasies
of
young
philanthropy
than
to
sweep
them
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
anxiety
reached
a
high
pitch
;
but
there
was
something
in
Clym
's
*NL*
undeviating
manner
which
made
her
hesitate
before
sounding
him
on
*NL*
the
subject
.
At
this
point
in
their
experience
,
however
,
an
incident
*NL*
helped
her
.
It
occurred
one
evening
about
six
weeks
after
their
*NL*
union
,
and
arose
entirely
out
of
the
unconscious
misapplication
of
*NL*
Venn
of
the
fifty
guineas
intended
for
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
day
or
two
after
the
receipt
of
the
money
Thomasin
had
sent
a
note
*NL*
to
her
aunt
to
thank
her
.
She
had
been
surprised
at
the
largeness
of
*NL*
the
amount
;
but
as
no
sum
had
ever
been
mentioned
she
set
that
down
*NL*
to
her
late
uncle
's
generosity
.
She
had
been
strictly
charged
by
her
*NL*
aunt
to
say
nothing
to
her
husband
of
this
gift
;
and
Wildeve
,
as
was
*NL*
natural
enough
,
had
not
brought
himself
to
mention
to
his
wife
a
*NL*
single
particular
of
the
midnight
scene
in
the
heath
.
Christian
's
*NL*
terror
,
in
like
manner
,
had
tied
his
tongue
on
the
share
he
took
in
*NL*
that
proceeding
;
and
hoping
that
by
some
means
or
other
the
money
had
*NL*
gone
to
its
proper
destination
,
he
simply
asserted
as
much
,
without
*NL*
giving
details
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
,
when
a
week
or
two
had
passed
away
,
Mrs.
Yeobright
began
*NL*
to
wonder
why
she
never
heard
from
her
son
of
the
receipt
of
the
*NL*
present
;
and
to
add
gloom
to
her
perplexity
came
the
possibility
*NL*
that
resentment
might
be
the
cause
of
his
silence
.
She
could
hardly
*NL*
believe
as
much
,
but
why
did
he
not
write
?
She
questioned
Christian
,
*NL*
and
the
confusion
in
his
answers
would
at
once
have
led
her
to
*NL*
believe
that
something
was
wrong
,
had
not
one-half
of
his
story
been
*NL*
corroborated
by
Thomasin
's
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
was
in
this
state
of
uncertainty
when
she
was
informed
*NL*
one
morning
that
her
son
's
wife
was
visiting
her
grandfather
at
*NL*
Mistover
.
She
determined
to
walk
up
the
hill
,
see
Eustacia
,
and
*NL*
ascertain
from
her
daughter-in-law
's
lips
whether
the
family
guineas
,
*NL*
which
were
to
Mrs.
Yeobright
what
family
jewels
are
to
wealthier
*NL*
dowagers
,
had
miscarried
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Christian
learnt
where
she
was
going
his
concern
reached
its
*NL*
height
.
At
the
moment
of
her
departure
he
could
prevaricate
no
*NL*
longer
,
and
,
confessing
to
the
gambling
,
told
her
the
truth
as
far
*NL*
as
he
knew
it
--
that
the
guineas
had
been
won
by
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
is
he
going
to
keep
them
?
''
Mrs.
Yeobright
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
and
trust
not
!
''
moaned
Christian
.
``
He
's
a
good
man
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
will
do
right
things
.
He
said
you
ought
to
have
gied
Mr.
*NL*
Clym
's
share
to
Eustacia
,
and
that
's
perhaps
what
he
'll
do
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
as
soon
as
she
could
calmly
reflect
,
there
was
much
*NL*
likelihood
in
this
,
for
she
could
hardly
believe
that
Wildeve
would
*NL*
really
appropriate
money
belonging
to
her
son
.
The
intermediate
*NL*
course
of
giving
it
to
Eustacia
was
the
sort
of
thing
to
please
*NL*
Wildeve
's
fancy
.
But
it
filled
the
mother
with
anger
none
the
less
.
*NL*
That
Wildeve
should
have
got
command
of
the
guineas
after
all
,
and
*NL*
should
rearrange
the
disposal
of
them
,
placing
Clym
's
share
in
Clym
's
*NL*
wife
's
hands
,
because
she
had
been
his
own
sweetheart
,
and
might
be
so
*NL*
still
,
was
as
irritating
a
pain
as
any
that
Mrs.
Yeobright
had
ever
*NL*
borne
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
instantly
dismissed
the
wretched
Christian
from
her
employ
for
his
*NL*
conduct
in
the
affair
;
but
,
feeling
quite
helpless
and
unable
to
do
*NL*
without
him
,
told
him
afterwards
that
he
might
stay
a
little
longer
*NL*
if
he
chose
.
Then
she
hastened
off
to
Eustacia
,
moved
by
a
much
less
*NL*
promising
emotion
towards
her
daughter-in-law
than
she
had
felt
half
*NL*
an
hour
earlier
,
when
planning
her
journey
.
At
that
time
it
was
to
*NL*
inquire
in
a
friendly
spirit
if
there
had
been
any
accidental
loss
;
*NL*
now
it
was
to
ask
plainly
if
Wildeve
had
privately
given
her
money
*NL*
which
had
been
intended
as
a
sacred
gift
to
Clym
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
at
two
o'clock
,
and
her
meeting
with
Eustacia
was
hastened
*NL*
by
the
appearance
of
the
young
lady
beside
the
pool
and
bank
which
*NL*
bordered
her
grandfather
's
premises
,
where
she
stood
surveying
*NL*
the
scene
,
and
perhaps
thinking
of
the
romantic
enactments
it
had
*NL*
witnessed
in
past
days
.
When
Mrs.
Yeobright
approached
,
Eustacia
*NL*
surveyed
her
with
the
calm
stare
of
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother-in-law
was
the
first
to
speak
.
``
I
was
coming
to
see
you
,
''
*NL*
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
said
Eustacia
with
surprise
,
for
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
much
to
the
*NL*
girl
's
mortification
,
had
refused
to
be
present
at
the
wedding
.
``
I
*NL*
did
not
at
all
expect
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
coming
on
business
only
,
''
said
the
visitor
,
more
coldly
than
at
*NL*
first
.
``
Will
you
excuse
my
asking
this
--
Have
you
received
a
gift
from
*NL*
Thomasin
's
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
gift
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
money
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
I
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
meant
yourself
,
privately
--
though
I
was
not
going
to
put
it
*NL*
in
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Money
from
Mr.
Wildeve
?
No
--
never
!
Madam
,
what
do
you
mean
by
that
?
''
*NL*
Eustacia
fired
up
all
too
quickly
,
for
her
own
consciousness
of
the
*NL*
old
attachment
between
herself
and
Wildeve
led
her
to
jump
to
the
*NL*
conclusion
that
Mrs.
Yeobright
also
knew
of
it
,
and
might
have
come
*NL*
to
accuse
her
of
receiving
dishonourable
presents
from
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
simply
ask
the
question
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
``
I
have
been
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
have
better
opinions
of
me
--
I
feared
you
were
against
*NL*
me
from
the
first
!
''
exclaimed
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
was
simply
for
Clym
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
with
too
much
*NL*
emphasis
in
her
earnestness
.
``
It
is
the
instinct
of
everyone
to
look
*NL*
after
their
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
imply
that
he
required
guarding
against
me
?
''
cried
*NL*
Eustacia
,
passionate
tears
in
her
eyes
.
``
I
have
not
injured
him
by
*NL*
marrying
him
!
What
sin
have
I
done
that
you
should
think
so
ill
of
me
?
*NL*
You
had
no
right
to
speak
against
me
to
him
when
I
have
never
wronged
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
did
what
was
fair
under
the
circumstances
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Yeobright
more
softly
.
``
I
would
rather
not
have
gone
into
this
*NL*
question
at
present
,
but
you
compel
me
.
I
am
not
ashamed
to
tell
you
*NL*
the
honest
truth
.
I
was
firmly
convinced
that
he
ought
not
to
marry
*NL*
you
--
therefore
I
tried
to
dissuade
him
by
all
the
means
in
my
power
.
*NL*
But
it
is
done
now
,
and
I
have
no
idea
of
complaining
any
more
.
I
am
*NL*
ready
to
welcome
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
it
is
very
well
to
see
things
in
that
business
point
of
*NL*
view
,
''
murmured
Eustacia
with
a
smothered
fire
of
feeling
.
``
But
why
*NL*
should
you
think
there
is
anything
between
me
and
Mr.
Wildeve
?
I
have
*NL*
a
spirit
as
well
as
you
.
I
am
indignant
;
and
so
would
any
woman
be
.
*NL*
It
was
a
condescension
in
me
to
be
Clym
's
wife
,
and
not
a
manoeuvre
,
*NL*
let
me
remind
you
;
and
therefore
I
will
not
be
treated
as
a
schemer
*NL*
whom
it
becomes
necessary
to
bear
with
because
she
has
crept
into
the
*NL*
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
vainly
endeavouring
to
control
her
anger
.
*NL*
``
I
have
never
heard
anything
to
show
that
my
son
's
lineage
is
not
as
*NL*
good
as
the
Vyes
'
--
perhaps
better
.
It
is
amusing
to
hear
you
talk
of
*NL*
condescension
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
condescension
,
nevertheless
,
''
said
Eustacia
vehemently
.
``
And
*NL*
if
I
had
known
then
what
I
know
now
,
that
I
should
be
living
in
this
*NL*
wild
heath
a
month
after
my
marriage
,
I
--
I
should
have
thought
twice
*NL*
before
agreeing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
better
not
to
say
that
;
it
might
not
sound
truthful
.
I
*NL*
am
not
aware
that
any
deception
was
used
on
his
part
--
I
know
there
was
*NL*
not
--
whatever
might
have
been
the
case
on
the
other
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
too
exasperating
!
''
answered
the
younger
woman
huskily
,
her
*NL*
face
crimsoning
,
and
her
eyes
darting
light
.
``
How
can
you
dare
to
*NL*
speak
to
me
like
that
?
I
insist
upon
repeating
to
you
that

known
that
my
life
would
from
my
marriage
up

this
time

NO

complain

I
have
never
uttered

a
sound
of
such
a
thing
to
him
;
but
it
is
true
.
I
hope
therefore
that
*NL*
in
the
future
you
will
be
silent
on
my
eagerness
.
If
you
injure
me
*NL*
now
you
injure
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Injure
you

Do
you
think

am
an
evil-disposed
person

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
injured
me
before
my
marriage

money

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
help
what
I
thought

But
I
have
never
spoken

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

it

you

``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
you
,

said
Eustacia
,
breathless
with
emotion
.
``
You

capable

Who
can
be
worse
than
a
wife
*NL*
who
encourages
a
lover
,
and
poisons
her
husband
's
mind
against
his
*NL*
relative
?
Yet
that
is
now
the
character
given
to
me
.
Will
you
not
*NL*
come
and
drag
him
out
of
my
hands
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
gave
back
heat
for
heat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
rage
at
me
,
madam
!
It
ill
becomes
your
beauty
,
and
I
am
not
*NL*
worth
the
injury
you
may
do
it
on
my
account
,
I
assure
you
.
I
am
only
*NL*
a
poor
old
woman
who
has
lost
a
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
treated
me
honourably
you
would
have
had
him
still
.
''
*NL*
Eustacia
said
,
while
scalding
tears
trickled
from
her
eyes
.
``
You
have
*NL*
brought
yourself
to
folly
;
you
have
caused
a
division
which
can
never
*NL*
be
healed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
done
nothing

This
audacity
from
a
young
woman
is
more
than
I
*NL*
can
bear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
asked
for
;
you
have
suspected
me
,
and
you
have
made
me
speak
*NL*
of
my
husband
in
a
way
I
would
not
have
done
.
You
will
let
him
know
*NL*
that
I
have
spoken
thus
,
and
it
will
cause
misery
between
us
.
Will
*NL*
you
go
away
from
me
?
You
are
no
friend
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
when
I
have
spoken
a
word
.
If
anyone
says
I
have
come
*NL*
here
to
question
you
without
good
grounds
for
it
,
that
person
speaks
*NL*
untruly
.
If
anyone
says
that
I
attempted
to
stop
your
marriage
by
any
*NL*
but
honest
means
,
that
person
,
too
,
does
not
speak
the
truth
.
I
have
*NL*
fallen
on
an
evil
time
;
God
has
been
unjust
to
me
in
letting
you
*NL*
insult
me
!
Probably
my
son
's
happiness
does
not
lie
on
this
side
of
*NL*
the
grave
,
for
he
is
a
foolish
man
who
neglects
the
advice
of
his
*NL*
parent
.
You
,
Eustacia
,
stand
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
without
*NL*
knowing
it
.
Only
show
my
son
one-half
the
temper
you
have
shown
me
*NL*
today
--
and
you
may
before
long
--
and
you
will
find
that
though
he
is
*NL*
as
gentle
as
a
child
with
you
now
,
he
can
be
as
hard
as
steel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
excited
mother
then
withdrew
,
and
Eustacia
,
panting
,
stood
looking
*NL*
into
the
pool
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
result
of
that
unpropitious
interview
was
that
Eustacia
,
instead
*NL*
of
passing
the
afternoon
with
her
grandfather
,
hastily
returned
home
*NL*
to
Clym
,
where
she
arrived
three
hours
earlier
than
she
had
been
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
indoors
with
her
face
flushed
,
and
her
eyes
still
showing
*NL*
traces
of
her
recent
excitement
.
Yeobright
looked
up
astonished
;
he
*NL*
had
never
seen
her
in
any
way
approaching
to
that
state
before
.
She
*NL*
passed
him
by
,
and
would
have
gone
upstairs
unnoticed
,
but
Clym
was
*NL*
so
concerned
that
he
immediately
followed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
,
Eustacia
?
''
he
said
.
She
was
standing
on
the
*NL*
hearthrug
in
the
bedroom
,
looking
upon
the
floor
,
her
hands
clasped
*NL*
in
front
of
her
,
her
bonnet
yet
unremoved
.
For
a
moment
she
did
not
*NL*
answer
;
and
then
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
your
mother
;
and
I
will
never
see
her
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
weight
fell
like
a
stone
upon
Clym
.
That
same
morning
,
when
Eustacia
*NL*
had
arranged
to
go
and
see
her
grandfather
,
Clym
had
expressed
a
*NL*
wish
that
she
would
drive
down
to
Blooms-End
and
inquire
for
her
*NL*
mother-in-law
,
or
adopt
any
other
means
she
might
think
fit
to
bring
*NL*
about
a
reconciliation
.
She
had
set
out
gaily
;
and
he
had
hoped
for
*NL*
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
this
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
tell
--
I
can
not
remember
.
I
met
your
mother
.
And
I
will
*NL*
never
meet
her
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
know
about
Mr.
Wildeve
now
?
I
wo
n't
have
wicked
opinions
*NL*
passed
on
me
by
anybody
.
O
!
it
was
too
humiliating
to
be
asked
if
I
*NL*
had
received
any
money
from
him
,
or
encouraged
him
,
or
something
of
*NL*
the
sort
--
I
do
n't
exactly
know
what
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
she
have
asked
you
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
must
have
been
some
meaning
in
it
.
What
did
my
mother
say
*NL*
besides
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
she
said
,
except
in
so
far
as
this
,
that
we
both
*NL*
said
words
which
can
never
be
forgiven
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
must
be
some
misapprehension
.
Whose
fault
was
it
that
her
*NL*
meaning
was
not
made
clear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
not
say
.
It
may
have
been
the
fault
of
the
*NL*
circumstances
,
which
were
awkward
at
the
very
least
.
O
Clym
--
I
can
not
*NL*
help
expressing
it
--
this
is
an
unpleasant
position
that
you
have
*NL*
placed
me
in
.
But
you
must
improve
it
--
yes
,
say
you
will
--
for
I
hate
*NL*
it
all
now
!
Yes
,
take
me
to
Paris
,
and
go
on
with
your
old
occupation
,
*NL*
Clym
!
I
do
n't
mind
how
humbly
we
live
there
at
first
,
if
it
can
only
*NL*
be
Paris
,
and
not
Egdon
Heath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
quite
given
up
that
idea
,
''
said
Yeobright
,
with
surprise
.
*NL*
``
Surely
I
never
led
you
to
expect
such
a
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
own
it
.
Yet
there
are
thoughts
which
can
not
be
kept
out
of
mind
,
*NL*
and
that
one
was
mine
.
Must
I
not
have
a
voice
in
the
matter
,
now
I
*NL*
am
your
wife
and
the
sharer
of
your
doom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
are
things
which
are
placed
beyond
the
pale
of
*NL*
discussion
;
and
I
thought
this
was
specially
so
,
and
by
mutual
*NL*
agreement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clym
,
I
am
unhappy
at
what
I
hear
,
''
she
said
in
a
low
voice
;
and
her
*NL*
eyes
drooped
,
and
she
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
indication
of
an
unexpected
mine
of
hope
in
Eustacia
's
bosom
*NL*
disconcerted
her
husband
.
It
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
*NL*
confronted
the
fact
of
the
indirectness
of
a
woman
's
movement
towards
*NL*
her
desire
.
But
his
intention
was
unshaken
,
though
he
loved
Eustacia
*NL*
well
.
All
the
effect
that
her
remark
had
upon
him
was
a
resolve
to
*NL*
chain
himself
more
closely
than
ever
to
his
books
,
so
as
to
be
the
*NL*
sooner
enabled
to
appeal
to
substantial
results
from
another
course
*NL*
in
arguing
against
her
whim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
mystery
of
the
guineas
was
explained
.
Thomasin
paid
them
*NL*
a
hurried
visit
,
and
Clym
's
share
was
delivered
up
to
him
by
her
own
*NL*
hands
.
Eustacia
was
not
present
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
this
is
what
my
mother
meant
,
''
exclaimed
Clym
.
``
Thomasin
,
do
*NL*
you
know
that
they
have
had
a
bitter
quarrel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
more
reticence
now
than
formerly
in
Thomasin
's
*NL*
manner
towards
her
cousin
.
It
is
the
effect
of
marriage
to
engender
*NL*
in
several
directions
some
of
the
reserve
it
annihilates
in
one
.
*NL*
``
Your
mother
told
me
,
''
she
said
quietly
.
``
She
came
back
to
my
house
*NL*
after
seeing
Eustacia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
worst
thing
I
dreaded
has
come
to
pass
.
Was
mother
much
*NL*
disturbed
when
she
came
to
you
,
Thomasin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
indeed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
leant
his
elbow
upon
the
post
of
the
garden
gate
,
and
covered
his
*NL*
eyes
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
trouble
about
it
,
Clym
.
They
may
get
to
be
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
.
``
Not
two
people
with
inflammable
natures
like
*NL*
theirs
.
Well
,
what
must
be
will
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
is
cheerful
in
it
--
the
guineas
are
not
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
have
lost
them
twice
over
than
have
had
this
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
these
jarring
events
Yeobright
felt
one
thing
to
be
*NL*
indispensable
--
that
he
should
speedily
make
some
show
of
progress
in
*NL*
his
scholastic
plans
.
With
this
view
he
read
far
into
the
small
hours
*NL*
during
many
nights
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
after
a
severer
strain
than
usual
,
he
awoke
with
a
*NL*
strange
sensation
in
his
eyes
.
The
sun
was
shining
directly
upon
the
*NL*
window-blind
,
and
at
his
first
glance
thitherward
a
sharp
pain
obliged
*NL*
him
to
close
his
eyelids
quickly
.
At
every
new
attempt
to
look
*NL*
about
him
the
same
morbid
sensibility
to
light
was
manifested
,
and
*NL*
excoriating
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
.
He
was
obliged
to
tie
a
*NL*
bandage
over
his
brow
while
dressing
;
and
during
the
day
it
could
not
*NL*
be
abandoned
.
Eustacia
was
thoroughly
alarmed
.
On
finding
that
the
*NL*
case
was
no
better
the
next
morning
they
decided
to
send
to
Anglebury
*NL*
for
a
surgeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
evening
he
arrived
,
and
pronounced
the
disease
to
be
acute
*NL*
inflammation
induced
by
Clym
's
night
studies
,
continued
in
spite
of
a
*NL*
cold
previously
caught
,
which
had
weakened
his
eyes
for
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fretting
with
impatience
at
this
interruption
to
a
task
he
was
so
*NL*
anxious
to
hasten
,
Clym
was
transformed
into
an
invalid
.
He
was
shut
*NL*
up
in
a
room
from
which
all
light
was
excluded
,
and
his
condition
*NL*
would
have
been
one
of
absolute
misery
had
not
Eustacia
read
to
him
by
*NL*
the
glimmer
of
a
shaded
lamp
.
He
hoped
that
the
worst
would
soon
be
*NL*
over
;
but
at
the
surgeon
's
third
visit
he
learnt
to
his
dismay
that
*NL*
although
he
might
venture
out
of
doors
with
shaded
eyes
in
the
course
*NL*
of
a
month
,
all
thought
of
pursuing
his
work
,
or
of
reading
print
of
*NL*
any
description
,
would
have
to
be
given
up
for
a
long
time
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
week
and
another
week
wore
on
,
and
nothing
seemed
to
lighten
the
*NL*
gloom
of
the
young
couple
.
Dreadful
imaginings
occurred
to
Eustacia
,
*NL*
but
she
carefully
refrained
from
uttering
them
to
her
husband
.
Suppose
*NL*
he
should
become
blind
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
never
recover
sufficient
*NL*
strength
of
sight
to
engage
in
an
occupation
which
would
be
congenial
*NL*
to
her
feelings
,
and
conduce
to
her
removal
from
this
lonely
dwelling
*NL*
among
the
hills
?
That
dream
of
beautiful
Paris
was
not
likely
to
*NL*
cohere
into
substance
in
the
presence
of
this
misfortune
.
As
day
after
*NL*
day
passed
by
,
and
he
got
no
better
,
her
mind
ran
more
and
more
in
*NL*
this
mournful
groove
,
and
she
would
go
away
from
him
into
the
garden
*NL*
and
weep
despairing
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
thought
he
would
send
for
his
mother
;
and
then
he
thought
*NL*
he
would
not
.
Knowledge
of
his
state
could
only
make
her
the
more
*NL*
unhappy
;
and
the
seclusion
of
their
life
was
such
that
she
would
*NL*
hardly
be
likely
to
learn
the
news
except
through
a
special
messenger
.
*NL*
Endeavouring
to
take
the
trouble
as
philosophically
as
possible
,
he
*NL*
waited
on
till
the
third
week
had
arrived
,
when
he
went
into
the
open
*NL*
air
for
the
first
time
since
the
attack
.
The
surgeon
visited
him
*NL*
again
at
this
stage
,
and
Clym
urged
him
to
express
a
distinct
opinion
.
*NL*
The
young
man
learnt
with
added
surprise
that
the
date
at
which
he
*NL*
might
expect
to
resume
his
labours
was
as
uncertain
as
ever
,
his
eyes
*NL*
being
in
that
peculiar
state
which
,
though
affording
him
sight
enough
*NL*
for
walking
about
,
would
not
admit
of
their
being
strained
upon
any
*NL*
definite
object
without
incurring
the
risk
of
reproducing
ophthalmia
*NL*
in
its
acute
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
was
very
grave
at
the
intelligence
,
but
not
despairing
.
A
quiet
*NL*
firmness
,
and
even
cheerfulness
,
took
possession
of
him
.
He
was
*NL*
not
to
be
blind
;
that
was
enough
.
To
be
doomed
to
behold
the
world
*NL*
through
smoked
glass
for
an
indefinite
period
was
bad
enough
,
and
*NL*
fatal
to
any
kind
of
advance
;
but
Yeobright
was
an
absolute
stoic
in
*NL*
the
face
of
mishaps
which
only
affected
his
social
standing
;
and
,
*NL*
apart
from
Eustacia
,
the
humblest
walk
of
life
would
satisfy
him
if
*NL*
it
could
be
made
to
work
in
with
some
form
of
his
culture
scheme
.
To
*NL*
keep
a
cottage
night-school
was
one
such
form
;
and
his
affliction
did
*NL*
not
master
his
spirit
as
it
might
otherwise
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
through
the
warm
sun
westward
into
those
tracts
of
Egdon
*NL*
with
which
he
was
best
acquainted
,
being
those
lying
nearer
to
his
old
*NL*
home
.
He
saw
before
him
in
one
of
the
valleys
the
gleaming
of
whetted
*NL*
iron
,
and
advancing
,
dimly
perceived
that
the
shine
came
from
the
*NL*
tool
of
a
man
who
was
cutting
furze
.
The
worker
recognized
Clym
,
and
*NL*
Yeobright
learnt
from
the
voice
that
the
speaker
was
Humphrey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Humphrey
expressed
his
sorrow
at
Clym
's
condition
,
and
added
;
``
Now
,
if
*NL*
yours
was
low-class
work
like
mine
,
you
could
go
on
with
it
just
the
*NL*
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
could
,
''
said
Yeobright
musingly
.
``
How
much
do
you
get
for
*NL*
cutting
these
faggots
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half-a-crown
a
hundred
,
and
in
these
long
days
I
can
live
very
well
*NL*
on
the
wages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
of
Yeobright
's
walk
home
to
Alderworth
he
was
lost
*NL*
in
reflections
which
were
not
of
an
unpleasant
kind
.
On
his
coming
up
*NL*
to
the
house
Eustacia
spoke
to
him
from
the
open
window
,
and
he
went
*NL*
across
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darling
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
am
much
happier
.
And
if
my
mother
were
*NL*
reconciled
to
me
and
to
you
I
should
,
I
think
,
be
happy
quite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
that
will
never
be
,
''
she
said
,
looking
afar
with
her
beautiful
*NL*
stormy
eyes
.
``
How
CAN
you
say
'
I
am
happier
,
'
and
nothing
changed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
arises
from
my
having
at
last
discovered
something
I
can
do
,
and
*NL*
get
a
living
at
,
in
this
time
of
misfortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
be
a
furze
and
turf-cutter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Clym
!
''
she
said
,
the
slight
hopefulness
previously
apparent
in
*NL*
her
face
going
off
again
,
and
leaving
her
worse
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
I
shall
.
Is
it
not
very
unwise
in
us
to
go
on
spending
the
*NL*
little
money
we
've
got
when
I
can
keep
down
expenditure
by
an
honest
*NL*
occupation
?
The
outdoor
exercise
will
do
me
good
,
and
who
knows
but
*NL*
that
in
a
few
months
I
shall
be
able
to
go
on
with
my
reading
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
grandfather
offers
to
assist
us
,
if
we
require
assistance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
require
it
.
If
I
go
furze-cutting
we
shall
be
fairly
well
*NL*
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
comparison
with
slaves
,
and
the
Israelites
in
Egypt
,
and
such
*NL*
people
!
''
A
bitter
tear
rolled
down
Eustacia
's
face
,
which
he
did
not
*NL*
see
.
There
had
been
_
nonchalance
_
in
his
tone
,
showing
her
that
he
*NL*
felt
no
absolute
grief
at
a
consummation
which
to
her
was
a
positive
*NL*
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
next
day
Yeobright
went
to
Humphrey
's
cottage
,
and
borrowed
*NL*
of
him
leggings
,
gloves
,
a
whet-stone
,
and
a
hook
,
to
use
till
he
*NL*
should
be
able
to
purchase
some
for
himself
.
Then
he
sallied
forth
*NL*
with
his
new
fellow-labourer
and
old
acquaintance
,
and
selecting
a
*NL*
spot
where
the
furze
grew
thickest
he
struck
the
first
blow
in
his
*NL*
adopted
calling
.
His
sight
,
like
the
wings
in
``
Rasselas
,
''
though
*NL*
useless
to
him
for
his
grand
purpose
,
sufficed
for
this
strait
,
and
*NL*
he
found
that
when
a
little
practice
should
have
hardened
his
palms
*NL*
against
blistering
he
would
be
able
to
work
with
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
after
day
he
rose
with
the
sun
,
buckled
on
his
leggings
,
and
went
*NL*
off
to
the
rendezvous
with
Humphrey
.
His
custom
was
to
work
from
four
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
till
noon
;
then
,
when
the
heat
of
the
day
was
*NL*
at
its
highest
,
to
go
home
and
sleep
for
an
hour
or
two
;
afterwards
*NL*
coming
out
again
and
working
till
dusk
at
nine
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
from
Paris
was
now
so
disguised
by
his
leather
accoutrements
,
*NL*
and
by
the
goggles
he
was
obliged
to
wear
over
his
eyes
,
that
his
*NL*
closest
friend
might
have
passed
by
without
recognizing
him
.
He
was
*NL*
a
brown
spot
in
the
midst
of
an
expanse
of
olive-green
gorse
,
and
*NL*
nothing
more
.
Though
frequently
depressed
in
spirit
when
not
actually
*NL*
at
work
,
owing
to
thoughts
of
Eustacia
's
position
and
his
mother
's
*NL*
estrangement
,
when
in
the
full
swing
of
labour
he
was
cheerfully
*NL*
disposed
and
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
daily
life
was
of
a
curious
microscopic
sort
,
his
whole
world
*NL*
being
limited
to
a
circuit
of
a
few
feet
from
his
person
.
His
*NL*
familiars
were
creeping
and
winged
things
,
and
they
seemed
to
enroll
*NL*
him
in
their
band
.
Bees
hummed
around
his
ears
with
an
intimate
*NL*
air
,
and
tugged
at
the
heath
and
furze-flowers
at
his
side
in
such
*NL*
numbers
as
to
weigh
them
down
to
the
sod
.
The
strange
amber-coloured
*NL*
butterflies
which
Egdon
produced
,
and
which
were
never
seen
elsewhere
,
*NL*
quivered
in
the
breath
of
his
lips
,
alighted
upon
his
bowed
back
,
and
*NL*
sported
with
the
glittering
point
of
his
hook
as
he
flourished
it
up
*NL*
and
down
.
Tribes
of
emerald-green
grasshoppers
leaped
over
his
feet
,
*NL*
falling
awkwardly
on
their
backs
,
heads
,
or
hips
,
like
unskilful
*NL*
acrobats
,
as
chance
might
rule
;
or
engaged
themselves
in
noisy
*NL*
flirtations
under
the
fern-fronds
with
silent
ones
of
homely
hue
.
Huge
*NL*
flies
,
ignorant
of
larders
and
wire-netting
,
and
quite
in
a
savage
*NL*
state
,
buzzed
about
him
without
knowing
that
he
was
a
man
.
In
and
*NL*
out
of
the
fern-dells
snakes
glided
in
their
most
brilliant
blue
and
*NL*
yellow
guise
,
it
being
the
season
immediately
following
the
shedding
*NL*
of
their
old
skins
,
when
their
colours
are
brightest
.
Litters
of
young
*NL*
rabbits
came
out
from
their
forms
to
sun
themselves
upon
hillocks
,
the
*NL*
hot
beams
blazing
through
the
delicate
tissue
of
each
thin-fleshed
*NL*
ear
,
and
firing
it
to
a
blood-red
transparency
in
which
the
veins
*NL*
could
be
seen
.
None
of
them
feared
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
monotony
of
his
occupation
soothed
him
,
and
was
in
itself
a
*NL*
pleasure
.
A
forced
limitation
of
effort
offered
a
justification
of
*NL*
homely
courses
to
an
unambitious
man
,
whose
conscience
would
hardly
*NL*
have
allowed
him
to
remain
in
such
obscurity
while
his
powers
were
*NL*
unimpeded
.
Hence
Yeobright
sometimes
sang
to
himself
,
and
when
obliged
*NL*
to
accompany
Humphrey
in
search
of
brambles
for
faggot-bonds
he
would
*NL*
amuse
his
companion
with
sketches
of
Parisian
life
and
character
,
and
*NL*
so
while
away
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
these
warm
afternoons
Eustacia
walked
out
alone
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
Yeobright
's
place
of
work
.
He
was
busily
chopping
away
*NL*
at
the
furze
,
a
long
row
of
faggots
which
stretched
downward
from
his
*NL*
position
representing
the
labour
of
the
day
.
He
did
not
observe
her
*NL*
approach
,
and
she
stood
close
to
him
,
and
heard
his
undercurrent
of
*NL*
song
.
It
shocked
her
.
To
see
him
there
,
a
poor
afflicted
man
,
earning
*NL*
money
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
,
had
at
first
moved
her
to
tears
;
but
*NL*
to
hear
him
sing
and
not
at
all
rebel
against
an
occupation
which
,
*NL*
however
satisfactory
to
himself
,
was
degrading
to
her
,
as
an
educated
*NL*
lady-wife
,
wounded
her
through
.
Unconscious
of
her
presence
,
he
still
*NL*
went
on
singing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
point

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
bitterly
plain
to
Eustacia
that
he
did
not
care
much
about
*NL*
social
failure
;
and
the
proud
fair
woman
bowed
her
head
and
wept
in
*NL*
sick
despair
at
thought
of
the
blasting
effect
upon
her
own
life
of
*NL*
that
mood
and
condition
in
him
.
Then
she
came
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
starve
rather
than
do
it
!
''
she
exclaimed
vehemently
.
``
And
*NL*
you
can
sing
!
I
will
go
and
live
with
my
grandfather
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eustacia
!
I
did
not
see
you
,
though
I
noticed
something
moving
,
''
he
*NL*
said
gently
.
He
came
forward
,
pulled
off
his
huge
leather
glove
,
and
*NL*
took
her
hand
.
``
Why
do
you
speak
in
such
a
strange
way
?
It
is
only
a
*NL*
little
old
song
which
struck
my
fancy
when
I
was
in
Paris
,
and
now
*NL*
just
applies
to
my
life
with
you
.
Has
your
love
for
me
all
died
,
*NL*
then

because
my
appearance
is
no
longer
that
of
a
fine
gentleman

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest

must
not

me
unpleasantly

``
Do

doing
that

in

shameful

so
contrarily
to
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tone

nothing

So
I
sing
to
pass
the
time
.
*NL*
Have
you
indeed
lost
all
tenderness
for
me
,
that
you
begrudge
me
a
*NL*
few
cheerful
moments
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
still
some
tenderness
left
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
words
have
no
longer
their
old
flavour
.
And
so
love
dies
with
*NL*
good
fortune
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
listen
to
this
,
Clym
--
it
will
end
bitterly
,
''
she
said
in
a
*NL*
broken
voice
.
``
I
will
go
home

III
*NL*
*NL*
She
Goes
Out
to
Battle
against
Depression
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
later
,
before
the
month
of
August
had
expired
,
Eustacia
*NL*
and
Yeobright
sat
together
at
their
early
dinner
.
Eustacia
's
manner
*NL*
had
become
of
late
almost
apathetic
.
There
was
a
forlorn
look
about
*NL*
her
beautiful
eyes
which
,
whether
she
deserved
it
or
not
,
would
have
*NL*
excited
pity
in
the
breast
of
anyone
who
had
known
her
during
the
full
*NL*
flush
of
her
love
for
Clym
.
The
feelings
of
husband
and
wife
varied
,
*NL*
in
some
measure
,
inversely
with
their
positions
.
Clym
,
the
afflicted
*NL*
man
,
was
cheerful
;
and
he
even
tried
to
comfort
her
,
who
had
never
*NL*
felt
a
moment
of
physical
suffering
in
her
whole
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
brighten
up
,
dearest
;
we
shall
be
all
right
again
.
Some
day
*NL*
perhaps
I
shall
see
as
well
as
ever
.
And
I
solemnly
promise
that
I
'll
*NL*
leave
off
cutting
furze
as
soon
as
I
have
the
power
to
do
anything
*NL*
better
.
You
can
not
seriously
wish
me
to
stay
idling
at
home
all
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
so
dreadful
--
a
furze-cutter
!
and
you
a
man
who
have
lived
*NL*
about
the
world
,
and
speak
French
,
and
German
,
and
who
are
fit
for
*NL*
what
is
so
much
better
than
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
when
you
first
saw
me
and
heard
about
me
I
was
wrapped
in
*NL*
a
sort
of
golden
halo
to
your
eyes
--
a
man
who
knew
glorious
things
,
*NL*
and
had
mixed
in
brilliant
scenes
--
in
short
,
an
adorable
,
delightful
,
*NL*
distracting
hero
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
I
am
a
poor
fellow
in
brown
leather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
taunt
me
.
But
enough
of
this
.
I
will
not
be
depressed
any
*NL*
more
.
I
am
going
from
home
this
afternoon
,
unless
you
greatly
object
.
*NL*
There
is
to
be
a
village
picnic
--
a
gipsying
,
they
call
it
--
at
East
*NL*
Egdon
,
and
I
shall
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
dance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
You
can
sing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
as
you
will
.
Must
I
come
to
fetch
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
return
soon
enough
from
your
work

But
do
not
inconvenience
*NL*
yourself
about
it

I
know
the
way
home
,
and
the
heath
has
no
terror
*NL*
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
can
you
cling
to
gaiety
so
eagerly
as
to
walk
all
the
way
to
a

village
festival

search
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
you
do
n't
like
my
going
alone

Clym
,

not

*NL*
``
No

But
I
would
come
with
you
if
it
could
give
you
any
pleasure
;
*NL*
though
,
as
things
stand
,
perhaps
you
have
too
much
of
me
already
.
*NL*
Still
,
I
somehow
wish
that
you
did
not
want
to
go
.
Yes
,
perhaps
I
*NL*
am
jealous
;
and
who
could
be
jealous
with
more
reason
than
I
,
a
*NL*
half-blind
man
,
over
such
a
woman
as
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
like
it
.
Let
me
go
,
and
do
n't
take
all
my
spirits
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
lose
all
my
own
,
my
sweet
wife
.
Go
and
do
whatever
*NL*
you
like
.
Who
can
forbid
your
indulgence
in
any
whim
?
You
have
all
*NL*
my
heart
yet
,
I
believe
;
and
because
you
bear
with
me
,
who
am
in
truth
*NL*
a
drag
upon
you
,
I
owe
you
thanks

Yes
,
go
alone
and
shine
.
As
for
*NL*
me
,
I
will
stick
to
my
doom
.
At
that
kind
of
meeting
people
would
*NL*
shun
me
.
My
hook
and
gloves
are
like
the
St.
Lazarus
rattle
of
the
*NL*
leper
,
warning
the
world
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
a
sight
that
would
*NL*
sadden
them
.
''
He
kissed
her
,
put
on
his
leggings
,
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
gone
she
rested
her
head
upon
her
hands
and
said
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
Two
wasted
lives
--
his
and
mine
.
And
I
am
come
to
this
!
Will
*NL*
it
drive
me
out
of
my
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
cast
about
for
any
possible
course
which
offered
the
least
*NL*
improvement
on
the
existing
state
of
things
,
and
could
find
none
.
She
*NL*
imagined
how
all
those
Budmouth
ones
who
should
learn
what
had
become
*NL*
of
her
would
say
,
``
Look
at
the
girl
for
whom
nobody
was
good
enough
!
''
*NL*
To
Eustacia
the
situation
seemed
such
a
mockery
of
her
hopes
that
*NL*
death
appeared
the
only
door
of
relief
if
the
satire
of
Heaven
should
*NL*
go
much
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
aroused
herself
and
exclaimed
,
``
But
I
'll
shake
it
off
.
*NL*
Yes
,
I
WILL
shake
it
off
!
No
one
shall
know
my
suffering
.
I
'll
be
*NL*
bitterly
merry
,
and
ironically
gay
,
and
I
'll
laugh
in
derision
.
And
*NL*
I
'll
begin
by
going
to
this
dance
on
the
green
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
ascended
to
her
bedroom
and
dressed
herself
with
scrupulous
*NL*
care
.
To
an
onlooker
her
beauty
would
have
made
her
feelings
almost
*NL*
seem
reasonable
.
The
gloomy
corner
into
which
accident
as
much
as
*NL*
indiscretion
had
brought
this
woman
might
have
led
even
a
moderate
*NL*
partisan
to
feel
that
she
had
cogent
reasons
for
asking
the
Supreme
*NL*
Power
by
what
right
a
being
of
such
exquisite
finish
had
been
placed
*NL*
in
circumstances
calculated
to
make
of
her
charms
a
curse
rather
than
*NL*
a
blessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
five
in
the
afternoon
when
she
came
out
from
the
house
ready
*NL*
for
her
walk
.
There
was
material
enough
in
the
picture
for
twenty
new
*NL*
conquests
.
The
rebellious
sadness
that
was
rather
too
apparent
when
*NL*
she
sat
indoors
without
a
bonnet
was
cloaked
and
softened
by
her
*NL*
outdoor
attire
,
which
always
had
a
sort
of
nebulousness
about
it
,
*NL*
devoid
of
harsh
edges
anywhere
;
so
that
her
face
looked
from
its
*NL*
environment
as
from
a
cloud
,
with
no
noticeable
lines
of
demarcation
*NL*
between
flesh
and
clothes
.
The
heat
of
the
day
had
scarcely
declined
*NL*
as
yet
,
and
she
went
along
the
sunny
hills
at
a
leisurely
pace
,
there
*NL*
being
ample
time
for
her
idle
expedition
.
Tall
ferns
buried
her
in
*NL*
their
leafage
whenever
her
path
lay
through
them
,
which
now
formed
*NL*
miniature
forests
,
though
not
one
stem
of
them
would
remain
to
bud
*NL*
the
next
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
site
chosen
for
the
village
festivity
was
one
of
the
lawn-like
*NL*
oases
which
were
occasionally
,
yet
not
often
,
met
with
on
the
plateaux
*NL*
of
the
heath
district
.
The
brakes
of
furze
and
fern
terminated
*NL*
abruptly
round
the
margin
,
and
the
grass
was
unbroken
.
A
green
*NL*
cattle-track
skirted
the
spot
,
without
,
however
,
emerging
from
*NL*
the
screen
of
fern
,
and
this
path
Eustacia
followed
,
in
order
to
*NL*
reconnoitre
the
group
before
joining
it
.
The
lusty
notes
of
the
*NL*
East
Egdon
band
had
directed
her
unerringly
,
and
she
now
beheld
*NL*
the
musicians
themselves
,
sitting
in
a
blue
waggon
with
red
wheels
*NL*
scrubbed
as
bright
as
new
,
and
arched
with
sticks
,
to
which
boughs
*NL*
and
flowers
were
tied
.
In
front
of
this
was
the
grand
central
dance
*NL*
of
fifteen
or
twenty
couples
,
flanked
by
minor
dances
of
inferior
*NL*
individuals
whose
gyrations
were
not
always
in
strict
keeping
with
*NL*
the
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
men
wore
blue
and
white
rosettes
,
and
with
a
flush
on
*NL*
their
faces
footed
it
to
the
girls
,
who
,
with
the
excitement
and
the
*NL*
exercise
,
blushed
deeper
than
the
pink
of
their
numerous
ribbons
.
*NL*
Fair
ones
with
long
curls
,
fair
ones
with
short
curls
,
fair
ones
*NL*
with
love-locks
,
fair
ones
with
braids
,
flew
round
and
round
;
and
*NL*
a
beholder
might
well
have
wondered
how
such
a
prepossessing
set
*NL*
of
young
women
of
like
size
,
age
,
and
disposition
,
could
have
been
*NL*
collected
together
where
there
were
only
one
or
two
villages
to
choose
*NL*
from
.
In
the
background
was
one
happy
man
dancing
by
himself
,
with
*NL*
closed
eyes
,
totally
oblivious
of
all
the
rest
.
A
fire
was
burning
*NL*
under
a
pollard
thorn
a
few
paces
off
,
over
which
three
kettles
hung
*NL*
in
a
row
.
Hard
by
was
a
table
where
elderly
dames
prepared
tea
,
but
*NL*
Eustacia
looked
among
them
in
vain
for
the
cattle-dealer
's
wife
who
*NL*
had
suggested
that
she
should
come
,
and
had
promised
to
obtain
a
*NL*
courteous
welcome
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unexpected
absence
of
the
only
local
resident
whom
Eustacia
knew
*NL*
considerably
damaged
her
scheme
for
an
afternoon
of
reckless
gaiety
.
*NL*
Joining
in
became
a
matter
of
difficulty
,
notwithstanding
that
,
were
*NL*
she
to
advance
,
cheerful
dames
would
come
forward
with
cups
of
tea
*NL*
and
make
much
of
her
as
a
stranger
of
superior
grace
and
knowledge
*NL*
to
themselves
.
Having
watched
the
company
through
the
figures
of
two
*NL*
dances
,
she
decided
to
walk
a
little
further
,
to
a
cottage
where
she
*NL*
might
get
some
refreshment
,
and
then
return
homeward
in
the
shady
time
*NL*
of
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
she
did
;
and
by
the
time
that
she
retraced
her
steps
towards
the
*NL*
scene
of
the
gipsying
,
which
it
was
necessary
to
repass
on
her
way
*NL*
to
Alderworth
,
the
sun
was
going
down
.
The
air
was
now
so
still
that
*NL*
she
could
hear
the
band
afar
off
,
and
it
seemed
to
be
playing
with
*NL*
more
spirit
,
if
that
were
possible
,
than
when
she
had
come
away
.
On
*NL*
reaching
the
hill
the
sun
had
quite
disappeared
;
but
this
made
little
*NL*
difference
either
to
Eustacia
or
to
the
revellers
,
for
a
round
yellow
*NL*
moon
was
rising
before
her
,
though
its
rays
had
not
yet
outmastered
*NL*
those
from
the
west
.
The
dance
was
going
on
just
the
same
,
but
*NL*
strangers
had
arrived
and
formed
a
ring
around
the
figure
,
so
that
*NL*
Eustacia
could
stand
among
these
without
a
chance
of
being
recognized
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
whole
village-full
of
sensuous
emotion
,
scattered
abroad
all
the
*NL*
year
long
,
surged
here
in
a
focus
for
an
hour
.
The
forty
hearts
of
*NL*
those
waving
couples
were
beating
as
they
had
not
done
since
,
twelve
*NL*
months
before
,
they
had
come
together
in
similar
jollity
.
For
the
*NL*
time
paganism
was
revived
in
their
hearts
,
the
pride
of
life
was
all
*NL*
in
all
,
and
they
adored
none
other
than
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
many
of
those
impassioned
but
temporary
embraces
were
destined
to
*NL*
become
perpetual
was
possibly
the
wonder
of
some
of
those
who
indulged
*NL*
in
them
,
as
well
as
of
Eustacia
who
looked
on
.
She
began
to
envy
*NL*
those
pirouetters
,
to
hunger
for
the
hope
and
happiness
which
the
*NL*
fascination
of
the
dance
seemed
to
engender
within
them
.
Desperately
*NL*
fond
of
dancing
herself
,
one
of
Eustacia
's
expectations
of
Paris
*NL*
had
been
the
opportunity
it
might
afford
her
of
indulgence
in
this
*NL*
favourite
pastime
.
Unhappily
,
that
expectation
was
now
extinct
within
*NL*
her
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
she
abstractedly
watched
them
spinning
and
fluctuating
in
the
*NL*
increasing
moonlight
she
suddenly
heard
her
name
whispered
by
a
voice
*NL*
over
her
shoulder
.
Turning
in
surprise
,
she
beheld
at
her
elbow
one
*NL*
whose
presence
instantly
caused
her
to
flush
to
the
temples
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Wildeve
.
Till
this
moment
he
had
not
met
her
eye
since
the
*NL*
morning
of
his
marriage
,
when
she
had
been
loitering
in
the
church
,
*NL*
and
had
startled
him
by
lifting
her
veil
and
coming
forward
to
*NL*
sign
the
register
as
witness
.
Yet
why
the
sight
of
him
should
have
*NL*
instigated
that
sudden
rush
of
blood
she
could
not
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
she
could
speak
he
whispered
,
``
Do
you
like
dancing
as
much
as
*NL*
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
do
,
''
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
dance
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
great
change
for
me
;
but
will
it
not
seem
strange
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
strangeness
can
there
be
in
relations
dancing
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
yes
,
relations
.
Perhaps
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
if
you
do
n't
like
to
be
seen
,
pull
down
your
veil
;
though
*NL*
there
is
not
much
risk
of
being
known
by
this
light
.
Lots
of
*NL*
strangers
are
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
as
he
suggested
;
and
the
act
was
a
tacit
acknowledgment
that
*NL*
she
accepted
his
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
gave
her
his
arm
and
took
her
down
on
the
outside
of
the
ring
*NL*
to
the
bottom
of
the
dance
,
which
they
entered
.
In
two
minutes
more
*NL*
they
were
involved
in
the
figure
and
began
working
their
way
upwards
*NL*
to
the
top
.
Till
they
had
advanced
halfway
thither
Eustacia
wished
*NL*
more
than
once
that
she
had
not
yielded
to
his
request
;
from
the
*NL*
middle
to
the
top
she
felt
that
,
since
she
had
come
out
to
seek
*NL*
pleasure
,
she
was
only
doing
a
natural
thing
to
obtain
it
.
Fairly
*NL*
launched
into
the
ceaseless
glides
and
whirls
which
their
new
position
*NL*
as
top
couple
opened
up
to
them
,
Eustacia
's
pulses
began
to
move
too
*NL*
quickly
for
long
rumination
of
any
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
length
of
five-and-twenty
couples
they
threaded
their
*NL*
giddy
way
,
and
a
new
vitality
entered
her
form
.
The
pale
ray
of
*NL*
evening
lent
a
fascination
to
the
experience
.
There
is
a
certain
*NL*
degree
and
tone
of
light
which
tends
to
disturb
the
equilibrium
of
*NL*
the
senses
,
and
to
promote
dangerously
the
tenderer
moods
;
added
to
*NL*
movement
,
it
drives
the
emotions
to
rankness
,
the
reason
becoming
*NL*
sleepy
and
unperceiving
in
inverse
proportion
;
and
this
light
fell
now
*NL*
upon
these
two
from
the
disc
of
the
moon
.
All
the
dancing
girls
felt
*NL*
the
symptoms
,
but
Eustacia
most
of
all
.
The
grass
under
their
feet
*NL*
became
trodden
away
,
and
the
hard
beaten
surface
of
the
sod
,
when
*NL*
viewed
aslant
towards
the
moonlight
,
shone
like
a
polished
table
.
*NL*
The
air
became
quite
still
,
the
flag
above
the
waggon
which
held
the
*NL*
musicians
clung
to
the
pole
,
and
the
players
appeared
only
in
outline
*NL*
against
the
sky
;
except
when
the
circular
mouths
of
the
trombone
,
*NL*
ophicleide
,
and
French
horn
gleamed
out
like
huge
eyes
from
the
shade
*NL*
of
their
figures
.
The
pretty
dresses
of
the
maids
lost
their
subtler
*NL*
day
colours
and
showed
more
or
less
of
a
misty
white
.
Eustacia
floated
*NL*
round
and
round
on
Wildeve
's
arm
,
her
face
rapt
and
statuesque
;
her
*NL*
soul
had
passed
away
from
and
forgotten
her
features
,
which
were
left
*NL*
empty
and
quiescent
,
as
they
always
are
when
feeling
goes
beyond
their
*NL*
register
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
near
she
was
to
Wildeve
!
it
was
terrible
to
think
of
.
She
could
*NL*
feel
his
breathing
,
and
he
,
of
course
,
could
feel
hers
.
How
badly
*NL*
she
had
treated
him
!
yet
,
here
they
were
treading
one
measure
.
The
*NL*
enchantment
of
the
dance
surprised
her
.
A
clear
line
of
difference
*NL*
divided
like
a
tangible
fence
her
experience
within
this
maze
of
*NL*
motion
from
her
experience
without
it
.
Her
beginning
to
dance
had
*NL*
been
like
a
change
of
atmosphere
;
outside
,
she
had
been
steeped
in
*NL*
arctic
frigidity
by
comparison
with
the
tropical
sensations
here
.
She
*NL*
had
entered
the
dance
from
the
troubled
hours
of
her
late
life
as
one
*NL*
might
enter
a
brilliant
chamber
after
a
night
walk
in
a
wood
.
Wildeve
*NL*
by
himself
would
have
been
merely
an
agitation
;
Wildeve
added
to
the
*NL*
dance
,
and
the
moonlight
,
and
the
secrecy
,
began
to
be
a
delight
.
*NL*
Whether
his
personality
supplied
the
greater
part
of
this
sweetly
*NL*
compounded
feeling
,
or
whether
the
dance
and
the
scene
weighed
*NL*
the
more
therein
,
was
a
nice
point
upon
which
Eustacia
herself
was
*NL*
entirely
in
a
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
began
to
say
``
Who
are
they
?
''
but
no
invidious
inquiries
were
*NL*
made
.
Had
Eustacia
mingled
with
the
other
girls
in
their
ordinary
*NL*
daily
walks
the
case
would
have
been
different
:
here
she
was
not
*NL*
inconvenienced
by
excessive
inspection
,
for
all
were
wrought
to
their
*NL*
brightest
grace
by
the
occasion
.
Like
the
planet
Mercury
surrounded
*NL*
by
the
lustre
of
sunset
,
her
permanent
brilliancy
passed
without
much
*NL*
notice
in
the
temporary
glory
of
the
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Wildeve
,
his
feelings
are
easy
to
guess
.
Obstacles
were
a
*NL*
ripening
sun
to
his
love
,
and
he
was
at
this
moment
in
a
delirium
of
*NL*
exquisite
misery
.
To
clasp
as
his
for
five
minutes
what
was
another
*NL*
man
's
through
all
the
rest
of
the
year
was
a
kind
of
thing
he
of
*NL*
all
men
could
appreciate
.
He
had
long
since
begun
to
sigh
again
*NL*
for
Eustacia
;
indeed
,
it
may
be
asserted
that
signing
the
marriage
*NL*
register
with
Thomasin
was
the
natural
signal
to
his
heart
to
return
*NL*
to
its
first
quarters
,
and
that
the
extra
complication
of
Eustacia
's
*NL*
marriage
was
the
one
addition
required
to
make
that
return
compulsory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
for
different
reasons
,
what
was
to
the
rest
an
exhilarating
*NL*
movement
was
to
these
two
a
riding
upon
the
whirlwind
.
The
dance
had
*NL*
come
like
an
irresistible
attack
upon
whatever
sense
of
social
order
*NL*
there
was
in
their
minds
,
to
drive
them
back
into
old
paths
which
were
*NL*
now
doubly
irregular
.
Through
three
dances
in
succession
they
spun
*NL*
their
way
;
and
then
,
fatigued
with
the
incessant
motion
,
Eustacia
*NL*
turned
to
quit
the
circle
in
which
she
had
already
remained
too
long
.
*NL*
Wildeve
led
her
to
a
grassy
mound
a
few
yards
distant
,
where
she
*NL*
sat
down
,
her
partner
standing
beside
her
.
From
the
time
that
he
*NL*
addressed
her
at
the
beginning
of
the
dance
till
now
they
had
not
*NL*
exchanged
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dance
and
the
walking
have
tired
you
?
''
he
said
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
not
greatly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
strange
that
we
should
have
met
here
of
all
places
,
after
*NL*
missing
each
other
so
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
missed
because
we
tried
to
miss
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
you
began
that
proceeding
--
by
breaking
a
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
scarcely
worth
while
to
talk
of
that
now
.
We
have
formed
other
*NL*
ties
since
then
--
you
no
less
than
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
hear
that
your
husband
is
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
ill
--
only
incapacitated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
that
is
what
I
mean
.
I
sincerely
sympathize
with
you
in
your
*NL*
trouble
.
Fate
has
treated
you
cruelly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
awhile
.
``
Have
you
heard
that
he
has
chosen
to
work
as
*NL*
a
furze-cutter
?
''
she
said
in
a
low
,
mournful
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
mentioned
to
me
,
''
answered
Wildeve
hesitatingly
.
``
But
I
*NL*
hardly
believed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
.
What
do
you
think
of
me
as
a
furze-cutter
's
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
the
same
as
ever
of
you
,
Eustacia
.
Nothing
of
that
sort
can
*NL*
degrade
you
:
you
ennoble
the
occupation
of
your
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
feel
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
chance
of
Mr.
Yeobright
getting
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks
so
.
I
doubt
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
quite
surprised
to
hear
that
he
had
taken
a
cottage
.
I
*NL*
thought
,
in
common
with
other
people
,
that
he
would
have
taken
you
*NL*
off
to
a
home
in
Paris
immediately
after
you
had
married
him
.
`
What
*NL*
a
gay
,
bright
future
she
has
before
her
!
'
I
thought
.
He
will
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
return
there
with
you
,
if
his
sight
gets
strong
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Observing
that
she
did
not
reply
he
regarded
her
more
closely
.
She
*NL*
was
almost
weeping
.
Images
of
a
future
never
to
be
enjoyed
,
the
*NL*
revived
sense
of
her
bitter
disappointment
,
the
picture
of
the
*NL*
neighbours
'
suspended
ridicule
which
was
raised
by
Wildeve
's
words
,
*NL*
had
been
too
much
for
proud
Eustacia
's
equanimity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
could
hardly
control
his
own
too
forward
feelings
when
he
saw
*NL*
her
silent
perturbation
.
But
he
affected
not
to
notice
this
,
and
she
*NL*
soon
recovered
her
calmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
intend
to
walk
home
by
yourself
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
''
said
Eustacia
.
``
What
could
hurt
me
on
this
heath
,
who
have
*NL*
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
diverging
a
little
I
can
make
my
way
home
the
same
as
yours
.
I
*NL*
shall
be
glad
to
keep
you
company
as
far
as
Throope
Corner
.
''
Seeing
*NL*
that
Eustacia
sat
on
in
hesitation
he
added
,
``
Perhaps
you
think
it
*NL*
unwise
to
be
seen
in
the
same
road
with
me
after
the
events
of
last
*NL*
summer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
think
no
such
thing
,
''
she
said
haughtily
.
``
I
shall
accept
*NL*
whose
company
I
choose
,
for
all
that
may
be
said
by
the
miserable
*NL*
inhabitants
of
Egdon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
us
walk
on
--
if
you
are
ready
.
Our
nearest
way
is
towards
*NL*
that
holly-bush
with
the
dark
shadow
that
you
see
down
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
arose
,
and
walked
beside
him
in
the
direction
signified
,
*NL*
brushing
her
way
over
the
damping
heath
and
fern
,
and
followed
by
the
*NL*
strains
of
the
merrymakers
,
who
still
kept
up
the
dance
.
The
moon
had
*NL*
now
waxed
bright
and
silvery
,
but
the
heath
was
proof
against
such
*NL*
illumination
,
and
there
was
to
be
observed
the
striking
scene
of
a
*NL*
dark
,
rayless
tract
of
country
under
an
atmosphere
charged
from
its
*NL*
zenith
to
its
extremities
with
whitest
light
.
To
an
eye
above
them
*NL*
their
two
faces
would
have
appeared
amid
the
expanse
like
two
pearls
*NL*
on
a
table
of
ebony
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
account
the
irregularities
of
the
path
were
not
visible
,
and
*NL*
Wildeve
occasionally
stumbled
;
whilst
Eustacia
found
it
necessary
*NL*
to
perform
some
graceful
feats
of
balancing
whenever
a
small
tuft
*NL*
of
heather
or
root
of
furze
protruded
itself
through
the
grass
of
*NL*
the
narrow
track
and
entangled
her
feet
.
At
these
junctures
in
her
*NL*
progress
a
hand
was
invariably
stretched
forward
to
steady
her
,
*NL*
holding
her
firmly
until
smooth
ground
was
again
reached
,
when
the
*NL*
hand
was
again
withdrawn
to
a
respectful
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
performed
the
journey
for
the
most
part
in
silence
,
and
drew
*NL*
near
to
Throope
Corner
,
a
few
hundred
yards
from
which
a
short
path
*NL*
branched
away
to
Eustacia
's
house
.
By
degrees
they
discerned
coming
*NL*
towards
them
a
pair
of
human
figures
,
apparently
of
the
male
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
came
a
little
nearer
Eustacia
broke
the
silence
by
saying
,
*NL*
``
One
of
those
men
is
my
husband
.
He
promised
to
come
to
meet
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
other
is
my
greatest
enemy
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
like
Diggory
Venn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
an
awkward
meeting
,
''
said
she
;
``
but
such
is
my
fortune
.
He
*NL*
knows
too
much
about
me
,
unless
he
could
know
more
,
and
so
prove
*NL*
to
himself
that
what
he
now
knows
counts
for
nothing
.
Well
,
let
it
*NL*
be
:
you
must
deliver
me
up
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
think
twice
before
you
direct
me
to
do
that
.
Here
is
a
man
*NL*
who
has
not
forgotten
an
item
in
our
meetings
at
Rainbarrow
:
he
is
in
*NL*
company
with
your
husband
.
Which
of
them
,
seeing
us
together
here
,
*NL*
will
believe
that
our
meeting
and
dancing
at
the
gipsy-party
was
by
*NL*
chance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
she
whispered
gloomily
.
``
Leave
me
before
they
come
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
bade
her
a
tender
farewell
,
and
plunged
across
the
fern
and
*NL*
furze
,
Eustacia
slowly
walking
on
.
In
two
or
three
minutes
she
met
*NL*
her
husband
and
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
journey
ends
here
for
tonight
,
reddleman
,
''
said
Yeobright
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
perceived
her
.
``
I
turn
back
with
this
lady
.
Good
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
,
Mr.
Yeobright
,
''
said
Venn
.
``
I
hope
to
see
you
better
*NL*
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
moonlight
shone
directly
upon
Venn
's
face
as
he
spoke
,
and
*NL*
revealed
all
its
lines
to
Eustacia
.
He
was
looking
suspiciously
at
*NL*
her
.
That
Venn
's
keen
eye
had
discerned
what
Yeobright
's
feeble
*NL*
vision
had
not
--
a
man
in
the
act
of
withdrawing
from
Eustacia
's
*NL*
side
--
was
within
the
limits
of
the
probable
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Eustacia
had
been
able
to
follow
the
reddleman
she
would
soon
have
*NL*
found
striking
confirmation
of
her
thought
.
No
sooner
had
Clym
given
*NL*
her
his
arm
and
led
her
off
the
scene
than
the
reddleman
turned
*NL*
back
from
the
beaten
track
towards
East
Egdon
,
whither
he
had
been
*NL*
strolling
merely
to
accompany
Clym
in
his
walk
,
Diggory
's
van
being
*NL*
again
in
the
neighbourhood
.
Stretching
out
his
long
legs
,
he
crossed
*NL*
the
pathless
portion
of
the
heath
somewhat
in
the
direction
which
*NL*
Wildeve
had
taken
.
Only
a
man
accustomed
to
nocturnal
rambles
could
*NL*
at
this
hour
have
descended
those
shaggy
slopes
with
Venn
's
velocity
*NL*
without
falling
headlong
into
a
pit
,
or
snapping
off
his
leg
by
*NL*
jamming
his
foot
into
some
rabbit
burrow
.
But
Venn
went
on
without
*NL*
much
inconvenience
to
himself
,
and
the
course
of
his
scamper
was
*NL*
towards
the
Quiet
Woman
Inn
.
This
place
he
reached
in
about
half
an
*NL*
hour
,
and
he
was
well
aware
that
no
person
who
had
been
near
Throope
*NL*
Corner
when
he
started
could
have
got
down
here
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lonely
inn
was
not
yet
closed
,
though
scarcely
an
individual
was
*NL*
there
,
the
business
done
being
chiefly
with
travellers
who
passed
the
*NL*
inn
on
long
journeys
,
and
these
had
now
gone
on
their
way
.
Venn
went
*NL*
to
the
public
room
,
called
for
a
mug
of
ale
,
and
inquired
of
the
maid
*NL*
in
an
indifferent
tone
if
Mr.
Wildeve
was
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
sat
in
an
inner
room
and
heard
Venn
's
voice
.
When
customers
*NL*
were
present
she
seldom
showed
herself
,
owing
to
her
inherent
dislike
*NL*
for
the
business
;
but
perceiving
that
no
one
else
was
there
tonight
*NL*
she
came
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
at
home
yet
,
Diggory
,
''
she
said
pleasantly
.
``
But
I
*NL*
expected
him
sooner
.
He
has
been
to
East
Egdon
to
buy
a
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
wear
a
light
wideawake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
saw
him
at
Throope
Corner
,
leading
one
home
,
''
said
Venn
drily
.
*NL*
``
A
beauty
,
with
a
white
face
and
a
mane
as
black
as
night
.
He
will
*NL*
soon
be
here
,
no
doubt
.
''
Rising
and
looking
for
a
moment
at
the
pure
,
*NL*
sweet
face
of
Thomasin
,
over
which
a
shadow
of
sadness
had
passed
*NL*
since
the
time
when
he
had
last
seen
her
,
he
ventured
to
add
,
``
Mr.
*NL*
Wildeve
seems
to
be
often
away
at
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
''
cried
Thomasin
in
what
was
intended
to
be
a
tone
of
gaiety
.
*NL*
``
Husbands
will
play
the
truant
,
you
know
.
I
wish
you
could
tell
me
of
*NL*
some
secret
plan
that
would
help
me
to
keep
him
home
at
my
will
in
*NL*
the
evenings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
consider
if
I
know
of
one
,
''
replied
Venn
in
that
same
light
*NL*
tone
which
meant
no
lightness
.
And
then
he
bowed
in
a
manner
of
his
*NL*
own
invention
and
moved
to
go
.
Thomasin
offered
him
her
hand
;
and
*NL*
without
a
sigh
,
though
with
food
for
many
,
the
reddleman
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Wildeve
returned
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
,
Thomasin
said
*NL*
simply
,
and
in
the
abashed
manner
usual
with
her
now
,
``
Where
is
the
*NL*
horse
,
Damon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
I
have
not
bought
it
,
after
all
.
The
man
asks
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
somebody
saw
you
at
Throope
Corner
leading
it
home
--
a
beauty
,
*NL*
with
a
white
face
and
a
mane
as
black
as
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Wildeve
,
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
;
``
who
told
you
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Venn
the
reddleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
expression
of
Wildeve
's
face
became
curiously
condensed
.
``
That
*NL*
is
a
mistake
--
it
must
have
been
some
one
else
,
''
he
said
slowly
and
*NL*
testily
,
for
he
perceived
that
Venn
's
countermoves
had
begun
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Rough
Coercion
Is
Employed
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Those
words
of
Thomasin
,
which
seemed
so
little
,
but
meant
so
much
,
*NL*
remained
in
the
ears
of
Diggory
Venn
:
``
Help
me
to
keep
him
home
in
the
*NL*
evenings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
occasion
Venn
had
arrived
on
Egdon
Heath
only
to
cross
to
the
*NL*
other
side
:
he
had
no
further
connection
with
the
interests
of
the
*NL*
Yeobright
family
,
and
he
had
a
business
of
his
own
to
attend
to
.
Yet
*NL*
he
suddenly
began
to
feel
himself
drifting
into
the
old
track
of
*NL*
manoeuvring
on
Thomasin
's
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
in
his
van
and
considered
.
From
Thomasin
's
words
and
manner
*NL*
he
had
plainly
gathered
that
Wildeve
neglected
her
.
For
whom
could
*NL*
he
neglect
her
if
not
for
Eustacia
?
Yet
it
was
scarcely
credible
*NL*
that
things
had
come
to
such
a
head
as
to
indicate
that
Eustacia
*NL*
systematically
encouraged
him
.
Venn
resolved
to
reconnoitre
somewhat
*NL*
carefully
the
lonely
road
which
led
along
the
vale
from
Wildeve
's
*NL*
dwelling
to
Clym
's
house
at
Alderworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
,
as
had
been
seen
,
Wildeve
was
quite
innocent
of
any
*NL*
predetermined
act
of
intrigue
,
and
except
at
the
dance
on
the
green
*NL*
he
had
not
once
met
Eustacia
since
her
marriage
.
But
that
the
spirit
*NL*
of
intrigue
was
in
him
had
been
shown
by
a
recent
romantic
habit
of
*NL*
his
:
a
habit
of
going
out
after
dark
and
strolling
towards
Alderworth
,
*NL*
there
looking
at
the
moon
and
stars
,
looking
at
Eustacia
's
house
,
and
*NL*
walking
back
at
leisure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
when
watching
on
the
night
after
the
festival
,
the
*NL*
reddleman
saw
him
ascend
by
the
little
path
,
lean
over
the
front
gate
*NL*
of
Clym
's
garden
,
sigh
,
and
turn
to
go
back
again
.
It
was
plain
that
*NL*
Wildeve
's
intrigue
was
rather
ideal
than
real
.
Venn
retreated
before
*NL*
him
down
the
hill
to
a
place
where
the
path
was
merely
a
deep
groove
*NL*
between
the
heather
;
here
he
mysteriously
bent
over
the
ground
for
a
*NL*
few
minutes
,
and
retired
.
When
Wildeve
came
on
to
that
spot
his
ankle
*NL*
was
caught
by
something
,
and
he
fell
headlong
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
had
recovered
the
power
of
respiration
he
sat
up
and
*NL*
listened
.
There
was
not
a
sound
in
the
gloom
beyond
the
spiritless
*NL*
stir
of
the
summer
wind
.
Feeling
about
for
the
obstacle
which
had
*NL*
flung
him
down
,
he
discovered
that
two
tufts
of
heath
had
been
tied
*NL*
together
across
the
path
,
forming
a
loop
,
which
to
a
traveller
was
*NL*
certain
overthrow
.
Wildeve
pulled
off
the
string
that
bound
them
,
and
*NL*
went
on
with
tolerable
quickness
.
On
reaching
home
he
found
the
cord
*NL*
to
be
of
a
reddish
colour
.
It
was
just
what
he
had
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
his
weaknesses
were
not
specially
those
akin
to
physical
*NL*
fear
,
the
species
of
_
coup-de-Jarnac
_
from
one
he
knew
too
well
*NL*
troubled
the
mind
of
Wildeve
.
But
his
movements
were
unaltered
*NL*
thereby
.
A
night
or
two
later
he
again
went
along
the
vale
to
*NL*
Alderworth
,
taking
the
precaution
of
keeping
out
of
any
path
.
The
*NL*
sense
that
he
was
watched
,
that
craft
was
employed
to
circumvent
his
*NL*
errant
tastes
,
added
piquancy
to
a
journey
so
entirely
sentimental
,
*NL*
so
long
as
the
danger
was
of
no
fearful
sort
.
He
imagined
that
Venn
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Yeobright
were
in
league
,
and
felt
that
there
was
a
certain
*NL*
legitimacy
in
combating
such
a
coalition
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heath
tonight
appeared
to
be
totally
deserted
:
and
Wildeve
,
after
*NL*
looking
over
Eustacia
's
garden
gate
for
some
little
time
,
with
a
cigar
*NL*
in
his
mouth
,
was
tempted
by
the
fascination
that
emotional
smuggling
*NL*
had
for
his
nature
to
advance
towards
the
window
,
which
was
not
quite
*NL*
closed
,
the
blind
being
only
partly
drawn
down
.
He
could
see
into
*NL*
the
room
,
and
Eustacia
was
sitting
there
alone
.
Wildeve
contemplated
*NL*
her
for
a
minute
,
and
then
retreating
into
the
heath
beat
the
ferns
*NL*
lightly
,
whereupon
moths
flew
out
alarmed
.
Securing
one
,
he
returned
*NL*
to
the
window
,
and
holding
the
moth
to
the
chink
,
opened
his
hand
.
*NL*
The
moth
made
towards
the
candle
upon
Eustacia
's
table
,
hovered
round
*NL*
it
two
or
three
times
,
and
flew
into
the
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
started
up
.
This
had
been
a
well-known
signal
in
old
times
*NL*
when
Wildeve
had
used
to
come
secretly
wooing
to
Mistover
.
She
at
*NL*
once
knew
that
Wildeve
was
outside
,
but
before
she
could
consider
*NL*
what
to
do
her
husband
came
in
from
upstairs
.
Eustacia
's
face
burnt
*NL*
crimson
at
the
unexpected
collision
of
incidents
,
and
filled
it
with
*NL*
an
animation
that
it
too
frequently
lacked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
very
high
colour
,
dearest
,
''
said
Yeobright
,
when
he
came
*NL*
close
enough
to
see
it
.
``
Your
appearance
would
be
no
worse
if
it
were
*NL*
always
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
warm
,
''
said
Eustacia
.
``
I
think
I
will
go
into
the
air
for
a
few
*NL*
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
go
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
.
I
am
only
going
to
the
gate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
arose
,
but
before
she
had
time
to
get
out
of
the
room
a
loud
*NL*
rapping
began
upon
the
front
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
--
I
'll
go
,
''
said
Eustacia
in
an
unusually
quick
tone
for
her
;
*NL*
and
she
glanced
eagerly
towards
the
window
whence
the
moth
had
flown
;
*NL*
but
nothing
appeared
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
not
at
this
time
of
the
evening
,
''
he
said
.
Clym
*NL*
stepped
before
her
into
the
passage
,
and
Eustacia
waited
,
her
*NL*
somnolent
manner
covering
her
inner
heat
and
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
listened
,
and
Clym
opened
the
door
.
No
words
were
uttered
*NL*
outside
,
and
presently
he
closed
it
and
came
back
,
saying
,
``
Nobody
*NL*
was
there
.
I
wonder
what
that
could
have
meant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
left
to
wonder
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
for
no
*NL*
explanation
offered
itself
,
and
Eustacia
said
nothing
,
the
additional
*NL*
fact
that
she
knew
of
only
adding
more
mystery
to
the
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
a
little
drama
had
been
acted
outside
which
saved
Eustacia
*NL*
from
all
possibility
of
compromising
herself
that
evening
at
least
.
*NL*
While
Wildeve
had
been
preparing
his
moth-signal
another
person
had
*NL*
come
behind
him
up
to
the
gate
.
This
man
,
who
carried
a
gun
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
looked
on
for
a
moment
at
the
other
's
operation
by
the
window
,
*NL*
walked
up
to
the
house
,
knocked
at
the
door
,
and
then
vanished
round
*NL*
the
corner
and
over
the
hedge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
him
!
''
said
Wildeve
.
``
He
has
been
watching
me
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
his
signal
had
been
rendered
futile
by
this
uproarious
rapping
*NL*
Wildeve
withdrew
,
passed
out
at
the
gate
,
and
walked
quickly
down
*NL*
the
path
without
thinking
of
anything
except
getting
away
unnoticed
.
*NL*
Half-way
down
the
hill
the
path
ran
near
a
knot
of
stunted
hollies
,
*NL*
which
in
the
general
darkness
of
the
scene
stood
as
the
pupil
in
a
*NL*
black
eye
.
When
Wildeve
reached
this
point
a
report
startled
his
ear
,
*NL*
and
a
few
spent
gunshots
fell
among
the
leaves
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
doubt
that
he
himself
was
the
cause
of
that
gun
's
*NL*
discharge
;
and
he
rushed
into
the
clump
of
hollies
,
beating
the
bushes
*NL*
furiously
with
his
stick
;
but
nobody
was
there
.
This
attack
was
a
*NL*
more
serious
matter
than
the
last
,
and
it
was
some
time
before
Wildeve
*NL*
recovered
his
equanimity
.
A
new
and
most
unpleasant
system
of
menace
*NL*
had
begun
,
and
the
intent
appeared
to
be
to
do
him
grievous
bodily
*NL*
harm
.
Wildeve
had
looked
upon
Venn
's
first
attempt
as
a
species
of
*NL*
horse-play
,
which
the
reddleman
had
indulged
in
for
want
of
knowing
*NL*
better
;
but
now
the
boundary
line
was
passed
which
divides
the
*NL*
annoying
from
the
perilous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Wildeve
known
how
thoroughly
in
earnest
Venn
had
become
he
*NL*
might
have
been
still
more
alarmed
.
The
reddleman
had
been
almost
*NL*
exasperated
by
the
sight
of
Wildeve
outside
Clym
's
house
,
and
he
was
*NL*
prepared
to
go
to
any
lengths
short
of
absolutely
shooting
him
,
to
*NL*
terrify
the
young
innkeeper
out
of
his
recalcitrant
impulses
.
The
*NL*
doubtful
legitimacy
of
such
rough
coercion
did
not
disturb
the
mind
*NL*
of
Venn
.
It
troubles
few
such
minds
in
such
cases
,
and
sometimes
this
*NL*
is
not
to
be
regretted
.
From
the
impeachment
of
Strafford
to
Farmer
*NL*
Lynch
's
short
way
with
the
scamps
of
Virginia
there
have
been
many
*NL*
triumphs
of
justice
which
are
mockeries
of
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
half
a
mile
below
Clym
's
secluded
dwelling
lay
a
hamlet
where
*NL*
lived
one
of
the
two
constables
who
preserved
the
peace
in
the
parish
*NL*
of
Alderworth
,
and
Wildeve
went
straight
to
the
constable
's
cottage
.
*NL*
Almost
the
first
thing
that
he
saw
on
opening
the
door
was
the
*NL*
constable
's
truncheon
hanging
to
a
nail
,
as
if
to
assure
him
that
*NL*
here
were
the
means
to
his
purpose
.
On
inquiry
,
however
,
of
the
*NL*
constable
's
wife
he
learnt
that
the
constable
was
not
at
home
.
*NL*
Wildeve
said
he
would
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minutes
ticked
on
,
and
the
constable
did
not
arrive
.
Wildeve
*NL*
cooled
down
from
his
state
of
high
indignation
to
a
restless
*NL*
dissatisfaction
with
himself
,
the
scene
,
the
constable
's
wife
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
set
of
circumstances
.
He
arose
and
left
the
house
.
Altogether
,
*NL*
the
experience
of
that
evening
had
had
a
cooling
,
not
to
say
a
*NL*
chilling
,
effect
on
misdirected
tenderness
,
and
Wildeve
was
in
no
*NL*
mood
to
ramble
again
to
Alderworth
after
nightfall
in
hope
of
a
stray
*NL*
glance
from
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
far
the
reddleman
had
been
tolerably
successful
in
his
rude
*NL*
contrivances
for
keeping
down
Wildeve
's
inclination
to
rove
in
the
*NL*
evening
.
He
had
nipped
in
the
bud
the
possible
meeting
between
*NL*
Eustacia
and
her
old
lover
this
very
night
.
But
he
had
not
*NL*
anticipated
that
the
tendency
of
his
action
would
be
to
divert
*NL*
Wildeve
's
movement
rather
than
to
stop
it
.
The
gambling
with
the
*NL*
guineas
had
not
conduced
to
make
him
a
welcome
guest
to
Clym
;
but
to
*NL*
call
upon
his
wife
's
relative
was
natural
,
and
he
was
determined
to
*NL*
see
Eustacia
.
It
was
necessary
to
choose
some
less
untoward
hour
than
*NL*
ten
o'clock
at
night
.
``
Since
it
is
unsafe
to
go
in
the
evening
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
I
'll
go
by
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Venn
had
left
the
heath
and
gone
to
call
upon
Mrs.
*NL*
Yeobright
,
with
whom
he
had
been
on
friendly
terms
since
she
had
*NL*
learnt
what
a
providential
countermove
he
had
made
towards
the
*NL*
restitution
of
the
family
guineas
.
She
wondered
at
the
lateness
of
*NL*
his
call
,
but
had
no
objection
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
a
full
account
of
Clym
's
affliction
,
and
of
the
state
in
*NL*
which
he
was
living
;
then
,
referring
to
Thomasin
,
touched
gently
upon
*NL*
the
apparent
sadness
of
her
days
.
``
Now
,
ma'am
,
depend
upon
it
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
you
could
n't
do
a
better
thing
for
either
of
'em
than
to
make
*NL*
yourself
at
home
in
their
houses
,
even
if
there
should
be
a
little
*NL*
rebuff
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
she
and
my
son
disobeyed
me
in
marrying
;
therefore
I
have
*NL*
no
interest
in
their
households
.
Their
troubles
are
of
their
own
*NL*
making
.
''
Mrs.
Yeobright
tried
to
speak
severely
;
but
the
account
of
*NL*
her
son
's
state
had
moved
her
more
than
she
cared
to
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
visits
would
make
Wildeve
walk
straighter
than
he
is
inclined
*NL*
to
do
,
and
might
prevent
unhappiness
down
the
heath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
something
tonight
out
there
which
I
did
n't
like
at
all
.
I
wish
*NL*
your
son
's
house
and
Mr.
Wildeve
's
were
a
hundred
miles
apart
instead
*NL*
of
four
or
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
WAS
an
understanding
between
him
and
Clym
's
wife
when
he
*NL*
made
a
fool
of
Thomasin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
hope
there
's
no
understanding
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
our
hope
will
probably
be
very
vain

O
Clym
!
O
Thomasin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
harm
done
yet
.
In
fact
,
I
've
persuaded
Wildeve
to
mind
*NL*
his
own
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
not
by
talking

by
a
plan
of
mine
called
the
silent
system

I
hope
you
'll
succeed

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
if
you
help
me
by
calling
and
making
friends
with
your
son

*NL*
You
'll
have
a
chance
then
of
using
your
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
since
it
has
come
to
this
,
''
said
Mrs.
Yeobright
sadly
,
``
I
will
*NL*
own
to
you
,
reddleman
,
that
I
thought
of
going
.
I
should
be
much
*NL*
happier
if
we
were
reconciled
.
The
marriage
is
unalterable
,
my
life
*NL*
may
be
cut
short
,
and
I
should
wish
to
die
in
peace
.
He
is
my
only
*NL*
son
;
and
since
sons
are
made
of
such
stuff
I
am
not
sorry
I
have
no
*NL*
other
.
As
for
Thomasin
,
I
never
expected
much
from
her
;
and
she
has
*NL*
not
disappointed
me
.
But
I
forgave
her
long
ago
;
and
I
forgive
him
*NL*
now
.
I
'll
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
very
time
of
the
reddleman
's
conversation
with
Mrs.
Yeobright
*NL*
at
Blooms-End
another
conversation
on
the
same
subject
was
languidly
*NL*
proceeding
at
Alderworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
day
Clym
had
borne
himself
as
if
his
mind
were
too
full
of
its
*NL*
own
matter
to
allow
him
to
care
about
outward
things
,
and
his
words
*NL*
now
showed
what
had
occupied
his
thoughts
.
It
was
just
after
the
*NL*
mysterious
knocking
that
he
began
the
theme
.
``
Since
I
have
been
away
*NL*
today
,
Eustacia
,
I
have
considered
that
something
must
be
done
to
heal
*NL*
up
this
ghastly
breach
between
my
dear
mother
and
myself
.
It
troubles
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
propose
to
do
?
''
said
Eustacia
abstractedly
,
for
she
could
*NL*
not
clear
away
from
her
the
excitement
caused
by
Wildeve
's
recent
*NL*
manoeuvre
for
an
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
take
a
very
mild
interest
in
what
I
propose
,
little
or
*NL*
much
,
''
said
Clym
,
with
tolerable
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mistake
me
,
''
she
answered
,
reviving
at
his
reproach
.
``
I
am
only
*NL*
thinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Partly
of
that
moth
whose
skeleton
is
getting
burnt
up
in
the
wick
of
*NL*
the
candle
,
''
she
said
slowly
.
``
But
you
know
I
always
take
an
interest
*NL*
in
what
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
dear
.
Then
I
think
I
must
go
and
call
upon
her
.
''
...
He
*NL*
went
on
with
tender
feeling
:
``
It
is
a
thing
I
am
not
at
all
too
proud
*NL*
to
do
,
and
only
a
fear
that
I
might
irritate
her
has
kept
me
away
so
*NL*
long
.
But
I
must
do
something
.
It
is
wrong
in
me
to
allow
this
sort
*NL*
of
thing
to
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
to
blame
yourself
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
getting
old
,
and
her
life
is
lonely
,
and
I
am
her
only
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
Thomasin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomasin
is
not
her
daughter
;
and
if
she
were
that
would
not
excuse
*NL*
me
.
But
this
is
beside
the
point
.
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
*NL*
her
,
and
all
I
wish
to
ask
you
is
whether
you
will
do
your
best
to
*NL*
help
me
--
that
is
,
forget
the
past
;
and
if
she
shows
her
willingness
to
*NL*
be
reconciled
,
meet
her
half-way
by
welcoming
her
to
our
house
,
or
by
*NL*
accepting
a
welcome
to
hers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Eustacia
closed
her
lips
as
if
she
would
rather
do
anything
*NL*
on
the
whole
globe
than
what
he
suggested
.
But
the
lines
of
her
mouth
*NL*
softened
with
thought
,
though
not
so
far
as
they
might
have
softened
;
*NL*
and
she
said
,
``
I
will
put
nothing
in
your
way
;
but
after
what
has
*NL*
passed
it
is
asking
too
much
that
I
go
and
make
advances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
distinctly
told
me
what
did
pass
between
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
do
it
then
,
nor
can
I
now
.
Sometimes
more
bitterness
is
*NL*
sown
in
five
minutes
than
can
be
got
rid
of
in
a
whole
life
;
and
that
*NL*
may
be
the
case
here
.
''
She
paused
a
few
moments
,
and
added
,
``
If
you
*NL*
had
never
returned
to
your
native
place
,
Clym
,
what
a
blessing
it
*NL*
would
have
been
for
you

altered
the
destinies
of

people

Eustacia
thought
;

she
kept
that
in

The
Journey
across
the
Heath
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Thursday
,
the
thirty-first
of
August
,
was
one
of
a
series
of
days
*NL*
during
which
snug
houses
were
stifling
,
and
when
cool
draughts
were
*NL*
treats
;
when
cracks
appeared
in
clayey
gardens
,
and
were
called
*NL*
``
earthquakes
''
by
apprehensive
children
;
when
loose
spokes
were
*NL*
discovered
in
the
wheels
of
carts
and
carriages
;
and
when
stinging
*NL*
insects
haunted
the
air
,
the
earth
,
and
every
drop
of
water
that
was
*NL*
to
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
garden
large-leaved
plants
of
a
tender
kind
*NL*
flagged
by
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
rhubarb
bent
downward
at
*NL*
eleven
;
and
even
stiff
cabbages
were
limp
by
noon
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
eleven
o'clock
on
this
day
that
Mrs.
Yeobright
started
*NL*
across
the
heath
towards
her
son
's
house
,
to
do
her
best
in
getting
*NL*
reconciled
with
him
and
Eustacia
,
in
conformity
with
her
words
to
the
*NL*
reddleman
.
She
had
hoped
to
be
well
advanced
in
her
walk
before
the
*NL*
heat
of
the
day
was
at
its
highest
,
but
after
setting
out
she
found
*NL*
that
this
was
not
to
be
done
.
The
sun
had
branded
the
whole
heath
*NL*
with
his
mark
,
even
the
purple
heath-flowers
having
put
on
a
brownness
*NL*
under
the
dry
blazes
of
the
few
preceding
days
.
Every
valley
was
*NL*
filled
with
air
like
that
of
a
kiln
,
and
the
clean
quartz
sand
of
*NL*
the
winter
water-courses
,
which
formed
summer
paths
,
had
undergone
*NL*
a
species
of
incineration
since
the
drought
had
set
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
cool
,
fresh
weather
Mrs.
Yeobright
would
have
found
no
*NL*
inconvenience
in
walking
to
Alderworth
,
but
the
present
torrid
attack
*NL*
made
the
journey
a
heavy
undertaking
for
a
woman
past
middle
age
;
and
*NL*
at
the
end
of
the
third
mile
she
wished
that
she
had
hired
Fairway
to
*NL*
drive
her
a
portion
at
least
of
the
distance
.
But
from
the
point
at
*NL*
which
she
had
arrived
it
was
as
easy
to
reach
Clym
's
house
as
to
get
*NL*
home
again
.
So
she
went
on
,
the
air
around
her
pulsating
silently
,
*NL*
and
oppressing
the
earth
with
lassitude
.
She
looked
at
the
sky
*NL*
overhead
,
and
saw
that
the
sapphirine
hue
of
the
zenith
in
spring
and
*NL*
early
summer
had
been
replaced
by
a
metallic
violet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
she
came
to
a
spot
where
independent
worlds
of
ephemerons
*NL*
were
passing
their
time
in
mad
carousal
,
some
in
the
air
,
some
on
the
*NL*
hot
ground
and
vegetation
,
some
in
the
tepid
and
stringy
water
of
a
*NL*
nearly
dried
pool
.
All
the
shallower
ponds
had
decreased
to
a
vaporous
*NL*
mud
amid
which
the
maggoty
shapes
of
innumerable
obscure
creatures
*NL*
could
be
indistinctly
seen
,
heaving
and
wallowing
with
enjoyment
.
*NL*
Being
a
woman
not
disinclined
to
philosophize
she
sometimes
sat
down
*NL*
under
her
umbrella
to
rest
and
to
watch
their
happiness
,
for
a
certain
*NL*
hopefulness
as
to
the
result
of
her
visit
gave
ease
to
her
mind
,
and
*NL*
between
important
thoughts
left
it
free
to
dwell
on
any
infinitesimal
*NL*
matter
which
caught
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
had
never
before
been
to
her
son
's
house
,
and
its
*NL*
exact
position
was
unknown
to
her
.
She
tried
one
ascending
path
and
*NL*
another
,
and
found
that
they
led
her
astray
.
Retracing
her
steps
,
she
*NL*
came
again
to
an
open
level
,
where
she
perceived
at
a
distance
a
man
*NL*
at
work
.
She
went
towards
him
and
inquired
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
labourer
pointed
out
the
direction
,
and
added
,
``
Do
you
see
that
*NL*
furze-cutter
,
ma'am
,
going
up
that
footpath
yond
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
strained
her
eyes
,
and
at
last
said
that
she
did
*NL*
perceive
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
follow
him
you
can
make
no
mistake
.
He
's
going
to
the
*NL*
same
place
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
the
figure
indicated
.
He
appeared
of
a
russet
hue
,
*NL*
not
more
distinguishable
from
the
scene
around
him
than
the
green
*NL*
caterpillar
from
the
leaf
it
feeds
on
.
His
progress
when
actually
*NL*
walking
was
more
rapid
than
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
;
but
she
was
enabled
to
*NL*
keep
at
an
equable
distance
from
him
by
his
habit
of
stopping
whenever
*NL*
he
came
to
a
brake
of
brambles
,
where
he
paused
awhile
.
On
coming
*NL*
in
her
turn
to
each
of
these
spots
she
found
half
a
dozen
long
limp
*NL*
brambles
which
he
had
cut
from
the
bush
during
his
halt
and
laid
*NL*
out
straight
beside
the
path
.
They
were
evidently
intended
for
*NL*
furze-faggot
bonds
which
he
meant
to
collect
on
his
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silent
being
who
thus
occupied
himself
seemed
to
be
of
no
more
*NL*
account
in
life
than
an
insect
.
He
appeared
as
a
mere
parasite
of
the
*NL*
heath
,
fretting
its
surface
in
his
daily
labour
as
a
moth
frets
a
*NL*
garment
,
entirely
engrossed
with
its
products
,
having
no
knowledge
of
*NL*
anything
in
the
world
but
fern
,
furze
,
heath
,
lichens
,
and
moss
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
furze-cutter
was
so
absorbed
in
the
business
of
his
journey
that
*NL*
he
never
turned
his
head
;
and
his
leather-legged
and
gauntleted
form
*NL*
at
length
became
to
her
as
nothing
more
than
a
moving
handpost
to
*NL*
show
her
the
way
.
Suddenly
she
was
attracted
to
his
individuality
*NL*
by
observing
peculiarities
in
his
walk
.
It
was
a
gait
she
had
seen
*NL*
somewhere
before
;
and
the
gait
revealed
the
man
to
her
,
as
the
gait
*NL*
of
Ahimaaz
in
the
distant
plain
made
him
known
to
the
watchman
of
the
*NL*
king
.
``
His
walk
is
exactly
as
my
husband
's
used
to
be
,
''
she
said
;
and
*NL*
then
the
thought
burst
upon
her
that
the
furze-cutter
was
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
scarcely
able
to
familiarize
herself
with
this
strange
*NL*
reality
.
She
had
been
told
that
Clym
was
in
the
habit
of
cutting
*NL*
furze
,
but
she
had
supposed
that
he
occupied
himself
with
the
labour
*NL*
only
at
odd
times
,
by
way
of
useful
pastime
;
yet
she
now
beheld
him
as
*NL*
a
furze-cutter
and
nothing
more
--
wearing
the
regulation
dress
of
the
*NL*
craft
,
and
thinking
the
regulation
thoughts
,
to
judge
by
his
motions
.
*NL*
Planning
a
dozen
hasty
schemes
for
at
once
preserving
him
and
Eustacia
*NL*
from
this
mode
of
life
she
throbbingly
followed
the
way
,
and
saw
him
*NL*
enter
his
own
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
side
of
Clym
's
house
was
a
knoll
,
and
on
the
top
of
the
knoll
a
*NL*
clump
of
fir
trees
so
highly
thrust
up
into
the
sky
that
their
foliage
*NL*
from
a
distance
appeared
as
a
black
spot
in
the
air
above
the
crown
*NL*
of
the
hill
.
On
reaching
this
place
Mrs.
Yeobright
felt
distressingly
*NL*
agitated
,
weary
,
and
unwell
.
She
ascended
,
and
sat
down
under
their
*NL*
shade
to
recover
herself
,
and
to
consider
how
best
to
break
the
ground
*NL*
with
Eustacia
,
so
as
not
to
irritate
a
woman
underneath
whose
apparent
*NL*
indolence
lurked
passions
even
stronger
and
more
active
than
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trees
beneath
which
she
sat
were
singularly
battered
,
rude
,
and
*NL*
wild
,
and
for
a
few
minutes
Mrs.
Yeobright
dismissed
thoughts
of
her
*NL*
own
storm-broken
and
exhausted
state
to
contemplate
theirs
.
Not
a
*NL*
bough
in
the
nine
trees
which
composed
the
group
but
was
splintered
,
*NL*
lopped
,
and
distorted
by
the
fierce
weather
that
there
held
them
at
*NL*
its
mercy
whenever
it
prevailed
.
Some
were
blasted
and
split
as
if
by
*NL*
lightning
,
black
stains
as
from
fire
marking
their
sides
,
while
the
*NL*
ground
at
their
feet
was
strewn
with
dead
fir-needles
and
heaps
of
*NL*
cones
blown
down
in
the
gales
of
past
years
.
The
place
was
called
the
*NL*
Devil
's
Bellows
,
and
it
was
only
necessary
to
come
there
on
a
March
or
*NL*
November
night
to
discover
the
forcible
reasons
for
that
name
.
On
the
*NL*
present
heated
afternoon
,
when
no
perceptible
wind
was
blowing
,
the
*NL*
trees
kept
up
a
perpetual
moan
which
one
could
hardly
believe
to
be
*NL*
caused
by
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
sat
for
twenty
minutes
or
more
ere
she
could
summon
*NL*
resolution
to
go
down
to
the
door
,
her
courage
being
lowered
to
zero
*NL*
by
her
physical
lassitude
.
To
any
other
person
than
a
mother
it
might
*NL*
have
seemed
a
little
humiliating
that
she
,
the
elder
of
the
two
women
,
*NL*
should
be
the
first
to
make
advances
.
But
Mrs.
Yeobright
had
well
*NL*
considered
all
that
,
and
she
only
thought
how
best
to
make
her
visit
*NL*
appear
to
Eustacia
not
abject
but
wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
her
elevated
position
the
exhausted
woman
could
perceive
the
roof
*NL*
of
the
house
below
,
and
the
garden
and
the
whole
enclosure
of
the
*NL*
little
domicile
.
And
now
,
at
the
moment
of
rising
,
she
saw
a
second
*NL*
man
approaching
the
gate
.
His
manner
was
peculiar
,
hesitating
,
and
*NL*
not
that
of
a
person
come
on
business
or
by
invitation
.
He
surveyed
*NL*
the
house
with
interest
,
and
then
walked
round
and
scanned
the
outer
*NL*
boundary
of
the
garden
,
as
one
might
have
done
had
it
been
the
*NL*
birthplace
of
Shakespeare
,
the
prison
of
Mary
Stuart
,
or
the
Chateau
*NL*
of
Hougomont
.
After
passing
round
and
again
reaching
the
gate
he
went
*NL*
in
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
was
vexed
at
this
,
having
reckoned
on
finding
her
*NL*
son
and
his
wife
by
themselves
;
but
a
moment
's
thought
showed
her
that
*NL*
the
presence
of
an
acquaintance
would
take
off
the
awkwardness
of
*NL*
her
first
appearance
in
the
house
,
by
confining
the
talk
to
general
*NL*
matters
until
she
had
begun
to
feel
comfortable
with
them
.
She
came
*NL*
down
the
hill
to
the
gate
,
and
looked
into
the
hot
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
lay
the
cat
asleep
on
the
bare
gravel
of
the
path
,
as
if
beds
,
*NL*
rugs
,
and
carpets
were
unendurable
.
The
leaves
of
the
hollyhocks
hung
*NL*
like
half-closed
umbrellas
,
the
sap
almost
simmered
in
the
stems
,
and
*NL*
foliage
with
a
smooth
surface
glared
like
metallic
mirrors
.
A
small
*NL*
apple
tree
,
of
the
sort
called
Ratheripe
,
grew
just
inside
the
gate
,
*NL*
the
only
one
which
throve
in
the
garden
,
by
reason
of
the
lightness
of
*NL*
the
soil
;
and
among
the
fallen
apples
on
the
ground
beneath
were
wasps
*NL*
rolling
drunk
with
the
juice
,
or
creeping
about
the
little
caves
in
*NL*
each
fruit
which
they
had
eaten
out
before
stupefied
by
its
sweetness
.
*NL*
By
the
door
lay
Clym
's
furze-hook
and
the
last
handful
of
faggot-bonds
*NL*
she
had
seen
him
gather
;
they
had
plainly
been
thrown
down
there
as
he
*NL*
entered
the
house
.

*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
A
Conjuncture
,
and
Its
Result
upon
the
Pedestrian
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
,
as
has
been
stated
,
was
determined
to
visit
Eustacia
boldly
,
*NL*
by
day
,
and
on
the
easy
terms
of
a
relation
,
since
the
reddleman
*NL*
had
spied
out
and
spoilt
his
walks
to
her
by
night
.
The
spell
that
*NL*
she
had
thrown
over
him
in
the
moonlight
dance
made
it
impossible
*NL*
for
a
man
having
no
strong
puritanic
force
within
him
to
keep
away
*NL*
altogether
.
He
merely
calculated
on
meeting
her
and
her
husband
in
an
*NL*
ordinary
manner
,
chatting
a
little
while
,
and
leaving
again
.
Every
*NL*
outward
sign
was
to
be
conventional
;
but
the
one
great
fact
would
be
*NL*
there
to
satisfy
him
:
he
would
see
her
.
He
did
not
even
desire
Clym
's
*NL*
absence
,
since
it
was
just
possible
that
Eustacia
might
resent
any
*NL*
situation
which
could
compromise
her
dignity
as
a
wife
,
whatever
the
*NL*
state
of
her
heart
towards
him
.
Women
were
often
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
accordingly
;
and
it
happened
that
the
time
of
his
arrival
*NL*
coincided
with
that
of
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
pause
on
the
hill
near
the
*NL*
house
.
When
he
had
looked
round
the
premises
in
the
manner
she
had
*NL*
noticed
he
went
and
knocked
at
the
door
.
There
was
a
few
minutes
'
*NL*
interval
,
and
then
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
,
the
door
opened
,
and
*NL*
Eustacia
herself
confronted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
could
have
imagined
from
her
bearing
now
that
here
stood
the
*NL*
woman
who
had
joined
with
him
in
the
impassioned
dance
of
the
week
*NL*
before
,
unless
indeed
he
could
have
penetrated
below
the
surface
and
*NL*
gauged
the
real
depth
of
that
still
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
reached
home
safely
?
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
''
she
carelessly
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
were
you
not
tired
the
next
day
?
I
feared
you
might
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
rather
.
You
need
not
speak
low
--
nobody
will
overhear
us
.
My
*NL*
small
servant
is
gone
on
an
errand
to
the
village
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
Clym
is
not
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
I
thought
that
perhaps
you
had
locked
the
door
because
you
were
*NL*
alone
and
were
afraid
of
tramps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
here
is
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
been
standing
in
the
entry
.
Closing
the
front
door
and
*NL*
turning
the
key
,
as
before
,
she
threw
open
the
door
of
the
adjoining
*NL*
room
and
asked
him
to
walk
in
.
Wildeve
entered
,
the
room
appearing
to
*NL*
be
empty
;
but
as
soon
as
he
had
advanced
a
few
steps
he
started
.
On
*NL*
the
hearth
rug
lay
Clym
asleep
.
Beside
him
were
the
leggings
,
thick
*NL*
boots
,
leather
gloves
,
and
sleeve-waistcoat
in
which
he
worked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
go
in
;
you
will
not
disturb
him
,
''
she
said
,
following
behind
.
*NL*
``
My
reason
for
fastening
the
door
is
that
he
may
not
be
intruded
upon
*NL*
by
any
chance
comer
while
lying
here
,
if
I
should
be
in
the
garden
or
*NL*
upstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
he
sleeping
there
?
''
said
Wildeve
in
low
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
weary
.
He
went
out
at
half-past
four
this
morning
,
and
*NL*
has
been
working
ever
since
.
He
cuts
furze
because
it
is
the
only
*NL*
thing
he
can
do
that
does
not
put
any
strain
upon
his
poor
eyes
.
''
The
*NL*
contrast
between
the
sleeper
's
appearance
and
Wildeve
's
at
this
moment
*NL*
was
painfully
apparent
to
Eustacia
,
Wildeve
being
elegantly
dressed
*NL*
in
a
new
summer
suit
and
light
hat
;
and
she
continued
:
``
Ah
!
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
differently
he
appeared
when
I
first
met
him
,
though
it
is
*NL*
such
a
little
while
ago
.
His
hands
were
as
white
and
soft
as
mine
;
*NL*
and
look
at
them
now
,
how
rough
and
brown
they
are
!
His
complexion
is
*NL*
by
nature
fair
,
and
that
rusty
look
he
has
now
,
all
of
a
colour
with
*NL*
his
leather
clothes
,
is
caused
by
the
burning
of
the
sun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
he
go
out
at
all
?
''
Wildeve
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
hates
to
be
idle
;
though
what
he
earns
does
n't
add
much
*NL*
to
our
exchequer
.
However
,
he
says
that
when
people
are
living
upon
*NL*
their
capital
they
must
keep
down
current
expenses
by
turning
a
penny
*NL*
where
they
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fates
have
not
been
kind
to
you
,
Eustacia
Yeobright
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nothing
to
thank
them
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
has
he
--
except
for
their
one
great
gift
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
looked
her
in
the
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
blushed
for
the
first
time
that
day
.
``
Well
,
I
am
a
*NL*
questionable
gift
,
''
she
said
quietly
.
``
I
thought
you
meant
the
gift
*NL*
of
content
--
which
he
has
,
and
I
have
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
understand
content
in
such
a
case
--
though
how
the
outward
*NL*
situation
can
attract
him
puzzles
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
because
you
do
n't
know
him
.
He
's
an
enthusiast
about
ideas
,
*NL*
and
careless
about
outward
things
.
He
often
reminds
me
of
the
Apostle
*NL*
Paul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
hear
that
he
's
so
grand
in
character
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
the
worst
of
it
is
that
though
Paul
was
excellent
as
a
man
*NL*
in
the
Bible
he
would
hardly
have
done
in
real
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
voices
had
instinctively
dropped
lower
,
though
at
first
they
*NL*
had
taken
no
particular
care
to
avoid
awakening
Clym
.
``
Well
,
if
that
*NL*
means
that
your
marriage
is
a
misfortune
to
you
,
you
know
who
is
to
*NL*
blame
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
marriage
is
no
misfortune
in
itself
,
''
she
retorted
with
some
*NL*
little
petulance
.
``
It
is
simply
the
accident
which
has
happened
since
*NL*
that
has
been
the
cause
of
my
ruin
.
I
have
certainly
got
thistles
for
*NL*
figs
in
a
worldly
sense
,
but
how
could
I
tell
what
time
would
bring
*NL*
forth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
,
Eustacia
,
I
think
it
is
a
judgment
upon
you
.
You
rightly
*NL*
belonged
to
me
,
you
know
;
and
I
had
no
idea
of
losing
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
was
not
my
fault
!
Two
could
not
belong
to
you
;
and
remember
*NL*
that
,
before
I
was
aware
,
you
turned
aside
to
another
woman
.
It
was
*NL*
cruel
levity
in
you
to
do
that
.
I
never
dreamt
of
playing
such
a
game
*NL*
on
my
side
till
you
began
it
on
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
nothing
by
it
,
''
replied
Wildeve
.
``
It
was
a
mere
interlude
.
*NL*
Men
are
given
to
the
trick
of
having
a
passing
fancy
for
somebody
else
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
a
permanent
love
,
which
reasserts
itself
afterwards
*NL*
just
as
before
.
On
account
of
your
rebellious
manner
to
me
I
was
*NL*
tempted
to
go
further
than
I
should
have
done
;
and
when
you
still
*NL*
would
keep
playing
the
same
tantalizing
part
I
went
further
still
,
*NL*
and
married
her
.
''
Turning
and
looking
again
at
the
unconscious
form
*NL*
of
Clym
,
he
murmured
,
``
I
am
afraid
that
you
do
n't
value
your
prize
,
*NL*
Clym
...
He
ought
to
be
happier
than
I
in
one
thing
at
least
.
He
may
*NL*
know
what
it
is
to
come
down
in
the
world
,
and
to
be
afflicted
with
a
*NL*
great
personal
calamity
;
but
he
probably
does
n't
know
what
it
is
to
*NL*
lose
the
woman
he
loved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
ungrateful
for
winning
her
,
''
whispered
Eustacia
,
``
and
in
*NL*
that
respect
he
is
a
good
man
.
Many
women
would
go
far
for
such
a
*NL*
husband
.
But
do
I
desire
unreasonably
much
in
wanting
what
is
called
*NL*
life
--
music
,
poetry
,
passion
,
war
,
and
all
the
beating
and
pulsing
*NL*
that
are
going
on
in
the
great
arteries
of
the
world
?
That
was
the
*NL*
shape
of
my
youthful
dream
;
but
I
did
not
get
it
.
Yet
I
thought
I
saw
*NL*
the
way
to
it
in
my
Clym
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
only
married
him
on
that
account
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
mistake
me
.
I
married
him
because
I
loved
him
,
but
I
wo
n't
*NL*
say
that
I
did
n't
love
him
partly
because
I
thought
I
saw
a
promise
of
*NL*
that
life
in
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
dropped
into
your
old
mournful
key

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
not

''
she
cried
perversely
.
``
I
began
*NL*
a
new
system
by
going
to
that
dance
,
and
I
mean
to
stick
to
it
.
Clym
*NL*
can
sing
merrily
;
why
should
not
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
looked
thoughtfully
at
her
.
``
It
is
easier
to
say
you
will
*NL*
sing
than
to
do
it
;
though
if
I
could
I
would
encourage
you
in
your
*NL*
attempt
.
But
as
life
means
nothing
to
me
,
without
one
thing
which
is
*NL*
now
impossible
,
you
will
forgive
me
for
not
being
able
to
encourage
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damon
,
what
is
the
matter
with
you
,
that
you
speak
like
that
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
,
raising
her
deep
shady
eyes
to
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
thing
I
shall
never
tell
plainly
;
and
perhaps
if
I
try
to
*NL*
tell
you
in
riddles
you
will
not
care
to
guess
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
remained
silent
for
a
minute
,
and
she
said
,
``
We
are
in
a
*NL*
strange
relationship
today
.
You
mince
matters
to
an
uncommon
nicety
.
*NL*
You
mean
,
Damon
,
that
you
still
love
me
.
Well
,
that
gives
me
sorrow
,
*NL*
for
I
am
not
made
so
entirely
happy
by
my
marriage
that
I
am
willing
*NL*
to
spurn
you
for
the
information
,
as
I
ought
to
do
.
But
we
have
said
*NL*
too
much
about
this
.
Do
you
mean
to
wait
until
my
husband
is
awake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
to
speak
to
him
;
but
it
is
unnecessary
.
Eustacia
,
if
I
*NL*
offend
you
by
not
forgetting
you
,
you
are
right
to
mention
it
;
but
do
*NL*
not
talk
of
spurning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
reply
,
and
they
stood
looking
musingly
at
Clym
as
he
slept
*NL*
on
in
that
profound
sleep
which
is
the
result
of
physical
labour
*NL*
carried
on
in
circumstances
that
wake
no
nervous
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
,
how
I
envy
him
that
sweet
sleep
!
''
said
Wildeve
.
``
I
have
not
*NL*
slept
like
that
since
I
was
a
boy
--
years
and
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
thus
watched
him
a
click
at
the
gate
was
audible
,
and
a
*NL*
knock
came
to
the
door
.
Eustacia
went
to
a
window
and
looked
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
countenance
changed
.
First
she
became
crimson
,
and
then
the
red
*NL*
subsided
till
it
even
partially
left
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
go
away
?
''
said
Wildeve
,
standing
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
O
,
what
she
said
to
me
that
day
!
I
can
not
understand
*NL*
this
visit
--
what
does
she
mean
?
And
she
suspects
that
past
time
of
*NL*
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
your
hands
.
If
you
think
she
had
better
not
see
me
here
I
'll
*NL*
go
into
the
next
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
:
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
at
once
withdrew
;
but
before
he
had
been
half
a
minute
in
the
*NL*
adjoining
apartment
Eustacia
came
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
``
we
wo
n't
have
any
of
this
.
If
she
comes
in
she
must
*NL*
see
you
--
and
think
if
she
likes
there
's
something
wrong
!
But
how
can
I
*NL*
open
the
door
to
her
,
when
she
dislikes
me
--
wishes
to
see
not
me
,
but
*NL*
her
son
?
I
wo
n't
open
the
door
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
knocked
again
more
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
knocking
will
,
in
all
likelihood
,
awaken
him
,
''
continued
*NL*
Eustacia
,
``
and
then
he
will
let
her
in
himself
.
Ah
--
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
could
hear
Clym
moving
in
the
other
room
,
as
if
disturbed
by
the
*NL*
knocking
,
and
he
uttered
the
word
``
Mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
he
is
awake
--
he
will
go
to
the
door
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
breath
of
*NL*
relief
.
``
Come
this
way
.
I
have
a
bad
name
with
her
,
and
you
must
not
*NL*
be
seen
.
Thus
I
am
obliged
to
act
by
stealth
,
not
because
I
do
ill
,
*NL*
but
because
others
are
pleased
to
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
she
had
taken
him
to
the
back
door
,
which
was
open
,
*NL*
disclosing
a
path
leading
down
the
garden
.
``
Now
,
one
word
,
Damon
,
''
*NL*
she
remarked
as
he
stepped
forth
.
``
This
is
your
first
visit
here
;
let
*NL*
it
be
your
last
.
We
have
been
hot
lovers
in
our
time
,
but
it
wo
n't
do
*NL*
now
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
``
I
have
had
all
I
came
for
,
and
I
am
*NL*
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sight
of
you
.
Upon
my
eternal
honour
I
came
for
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
kissed
his
hand
to
the
beautiful
girl
he
addressed
,
and
passed
*NL*
into
the
garden
,
where
she
watched
him
down
the
path
,
over
the
stile
*NL*
at
the
end
,
and
into
the
ferns
outside
,
which
brushed
his
hips
as
he
*NL*
went
along
till
he
became
lost
in
their
thickets
.
When
he
had
quite
*NL*
gone
she
slowly
turned
,
and
directed
her
attention
to
the
interior
of
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
possible
that
her
presence
might
not
be
desired
by
Clym
*NL*
and
his
mother
at
this
moment
of
their
first
meeting
,
or
that
it
*NL*
would
be
superfluous
.
At
all
events
,
she
was
in
no
hurry
to
meet
Mrs.
*NL*
Yeobright
.
She
resolved
to
wait
till
Clym
came
to
look
for
her
,
and
*NL*
glided
back
into
the
garden
.
Here
she
idly
occupied
herself
for
a
few
*NL*
minutes
,
till
finding
no
notice
was
taken
of
her
she
retraced
her
*NL*
steps
through
the
house
to
the
front
,
where
she
listened
for
voices
*NL*
in
the
parlour
.
But
hearing
none
she
opened
the
door
and
went
in
.
To
*NL*
her
astonishment
Clym
lay
precisely
as
Wildeve
and
herself
had
left
*NL*
him
,
his
sleep
apparently
unbroken
.
He
had
been
disturbed
and
made
to
*NL*
dream
and
murmur
by
the
knocking
,
but
he
had
not
awakened
.
Eustacia
*NL*
hastened
to
the
door
,
and
in
spite
of
her
reluctance
to
open
it
to
a
*NL*
woman
who
had
spoken
of
her
so
bitterly
,
she
unfastened
it
and
looked
*NL*
out
.
Nobody
was
to
be
seen
.
There
,
by
the
scraper
,
lay
Clym
's
hook
*NL*
and
the
handful
of
faggot-bonds
he
had
brought
home
;
in
front
of
her
*NL*
were
the
empty
path
,
the
garden
gate
standing
slightly
ajar
;
and
,
*NL*
beyond
,
the
great
valley
of
purple
heath
thrilling
silently
in
the
*NL*
sun
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
's
mother
was
at
this
time
following
a
path
which
lay
hidden
from
*NL*
Eustacia
by
a
shoulder
of
the
hill
.
Her
walk
thither
from
the
garden
*NL*
gate
had
been
hasty
and
determined
,
as
of
a
woman
who
was
now
no
less
*NL*
anxious
to
escape
from
the
scene
than
she
had
previously
been
to
enter
*NL*
it
.
Her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
;
within
her
two
sights
were
*NL*
graven
--
that
of
Clym
's
hook
and
brambles
at
the
door
,
and
that
of
a
*NL*
woman
's
face
at
a
window
.
Her
lips
trembled
,
becoming
unnaturally
*NL*
thin
as
she
murmured
,
''
'T
is
too
much
--
Clym
,
how
can
he
bear
to
do
it
!
*NL*
He
is
at
home
;
and
yet
he
lets
her
shut
the
door
against
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
anxiety
to
get
out
of
the
direct
view
of
the
house
she
had
*NL*
diverged
from
the
straightest
path
homeward
,
and
while
looking
about
*NL*
to
regain
it
she
came
upon
a
little
boy
gathering
whortleberries
in
*NL*
a
hollow
.
The
boy
was
Johnny
Nunsuch
,
who
had
been
Eustacia
's
stoker
*NL*
at
the
bonfire
,
and
,
with
the
tendency
of
a
minute
body
to
gravitate
*NL*
towards
a
greater
,
he
began
hovering
round
Mrs.
Yeobright
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
appeared
,
and
trotted
on
beside
her
without
perceptible
*NL*
consciousness
of
his
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
spoke
to
him
as
one
in
a
mesmeric
sleep
.
''
'T
is
a
long
*NL*
way
home
,
my
child
,
and
we
shall
not
get
there
till
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
,
''
said
her
small
companion
.
``
I
am
going
to
play
marnels
*NL*
afore
supper
,
and
we
go
to
supper
at
six
o'clock
,
because
father
comes
*NL*
home
.
Does
your
father
come
home
at
six
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
never
comes
;
nor
my
son
either
,
nor
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
made
you
so
down
?
Have
you
seen
a
ooser
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
what
's
worse
--
a
woman
's
face
looking
at
me
through
a
*NL*
window-pane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
a
bad
sight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
It
is
always
a
bad
sight
to
see
a
woman
looking
out
at
a
weary
*NL*
wayfarer
and
not
letting
her
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
when
I
went
to
Throope
Great
Pond
to
catch
effets
I
seed
myself
*NL*
looking
up
at
myself
,
and
I
was
frightened
and
jumped
back
like
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
...
``
If
they
had
only
shown
signs
of
meeting
my
advances
half-way
how
*NL*
well
it
might
have
been
done
!
But
there
is
no
chance
.
Shut
out
!
She
*NL*
must
have
set
him
against
me
.
Can
there
be
beautiful
bodies
without
*NL*
hearts
inside
?
I
think
so
.
I
would
not
have
done
it
against
a
*NL*
neighbour
's
cat
on
such
a
fiery
day
as
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
again
--
never
!
Not
even
if
they
send
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
a
very
curious
woman
to
talk
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
not
at
all
,
''
she
said
,
returning
to
the
boy
's
prattle
.
``
Most
*NL*
people
who
grow
up
and
have
children
talk
as
I
do
.
When
you
grow
up
*NL*
your
mother
will
talk
as
I
do
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
she
wo
n't

because
't
is
very
bad
to
talk
nonsense
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
child
;
it
is
nonsense

I
suppose

Are
you
not
nearly
spent
with
*NL*
the
heat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

But
not
so
much
as
you
be

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
face
is
white
and
wet

and
your
head
is
hanging-down-like

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
am
exhausted
from
inside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
,
every
time
you
take
a
step
,
go
like
this
?
''
The
child
in
*NL*
speaking
gave
to
his
motion
the
jerk
and
limp
of
an
invalid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
have
a
burden
which
is
more
than
I
can
bear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
boy
remained
silently
pondering
,
and
they
tottered
on
side
*NL*
by
side
until
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
elapsed
,
when
Mrs.
*NL*
Yeobright
,
whose
weakness
plainly
increased
,
said
to
him
,
``
I
must
sit
*NL*
down
here
to
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
seated
herself
he
looked
long
in
her
face
and
said
,
``
How
*NL*
funny
you
draw
your
breath
--
like
a
lamb
when
you
drive
him
till
he
's
*NL*
nearly
done
for
.
Do
you
always
draw
your
breath
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
always
.
''
Her
voice
was
now
so
low
as
to
be
scarcely
above
a
*NL*
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
go
to
sleep
there
,
I
suppose

wo
n't
you

You
have
shut
your
*NL*
eyes
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
shall
not
sleep
much
till
--
another
day
,
and
then
I
hope
to
have
*NL*
a
long
,
long
one
--
very
long
.
Now
can
you
tell
me
if
Rimsmoor
Pond
is
*NL*
dry
this
summer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rimsmoor
Pond
is
,
but
Oker
's
Pool
is
n't
,
because
he
is
deep

never
dry

't
is
just
over
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
water
clear

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

middling

except
where
the
heath-croppers
walk
into
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
take
this
,
and
go
as
fast
as
you
can

and
dip
me
up
the
*NL*
clearest
you
can
find
.
I
am
very
faint

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
from
the
small
willow
reticule
that
she
carried
in
her
hand
*NL*
an
old-fashioned
china
teacup
without
a
handle
;
it
was
one
of
half
a
*NL*
dozen
of
the
same
sort
lying
in
the
reticule
,
which
she
had
preserved
*NL*
ever
since
her
childhood
,
and
had
brought
with
her
today
as
a
small
*NL*
present
for
Clym
and
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
started
on
his
errand
,
and
soon
came
back
with
the
water
,
*NL*
such
as
it
was
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
attempted
to
drink
,
but
it
was
so
warm
*NL*
as
to
give
her
nausea
,
and
she
threw
it
away
.
Afterwards
she
still
*NL*
remained
sitting
,
with
her
eyes
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
waited
,
played
near
her
,
caught
several
of
the
little
brown
*NL*
butterflies
which
abounded
,
and
then
said
as
he
waited
again
,
``
I
like
*NL*
going
on
better
than
biding
still
.
Will
you
soon
start
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
might
go
on
by
myself
,
''
he
resumed
,
fearing
,
apparently
,
*NL*
that
he
was
to
be
pressed
into
some
unpleasant
service
.
``
Do
you
want
*NL*
me
any
more
,
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
tell
mother
?
''
the
boy
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
her
you
have
seen
a
broken-hearted
woman
cast
off
by
her
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
quite
leaving
her
he
threw
upon
her
face
a
wistful
glance
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
misgivings
on
the
generosity
of
forsaking
her
thus
.
He
*NL*
gazed
into
her
face
in
a
vague
,
wondering
manner
,
like
that
of
one
*NL*
examining
some
strange
old
manuscript
the
key
to
whose
characters
*NL*
is
undiscoverable
.
He
was
not
so
young
as
to
be
absolutely
without
*NL*
a
sense
that
sympathy
was
demanded
,
he
was
not
old
enough
to
be
*NL*
free
from
the
terror
felt
in
childhood
at
beholding
misery
in
adult
*NL*
quarters
hitherto
deemed
impregnable
;
and
whether
she
were
in
a
*NL*
position
to
cause
trouble
or
to
suffer
from
it
,
whether
she
and
her
*NL*
affliction
were
something
to
pity
or
something
to
fear
,
it
was
beyond
*NL*
him
to
decide
.
He
lowered
his
eyes
and
went
on
without
another
word
.
*NL*
Before
he
had
gone
half
a
mile
he
had
forgotten
all
about
her
,
except
*NL*
that
she
was
a
woman
who
had
sat
down
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Yeobright
's
exertions
,
physical
and
emotional
,
had
well-nigh
*NL*
prostrated
her
;
but
she
continued
to
creep
along
in
short
stages
with
*NL*
long
breaks
between
.
The
sun
had
now
got
far
to
the
west
of
south
and
*NL*
stood
directly
in
her
face
,
like
some
merciless
incendiary
,
brand
*NL*
in
hand
,
waiting
to
consume
her
.
With
the
departure
of
the
boy
*NL*
all
visible
animation
disappeared
from
the
landscape
,
though
the
*NL*
intermittent
husky
notes
of
the
male
grasshoppers
from
every
tuft
of
*NL*
furze
were
enough
to
show
that
amid
the
prostration
of
the
larger
*NL*
animal
species
an
unseen
insect
world
was
busy
in
all
the
fullness
of
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
two
hours
she
reached
a
slope
about
three-fourths
the
whole
*NL*
distance
from
Alderworth
to
her
own
home
,
where
a
little
patch
of
*NL*
shepherd
's
-
thyme
intruded
upon
the
path
;
and
she
sat
down
upon
the
*NL*
perfumed
mat
it
formed
there
.
In
front
of
her
a
colony
of
ants
had
*NL*
established
a
thoroughfare
across
the
way
,
where
they
toiled
a
*NL*
never-ending
and
heavy-laden
throng
.
To
look
down
upon
them
was
like
*NL*
observing
a
city
street
from
the
top
of
a
tower
.
She
remembered
*NL*
that
this
bustle
of
ants
had
been
in
progress
for
years
at
the
same
*NL*
spot
--
doubtless
those
of
the
old
times
were
the
ancestors
of
these
*NL*
which
walked
there
now
.
She
leant
back
to
obtain
more
thorough
rest
,
*NL*
and
the
soft
eastern
portion
of
the
sky
was
as
great
a
relief
to
her
*NL*
eyes
as
the
thyme
was
to
her
head
.
While
she
looked
a
heron
arose
on
*NL*
that
side
of
the
sky
and
flew
on
with
his
face
towards
the
sun
.
He
*NL*
had
come
dripping
wet
from
some
pool
in
the
valleys
,
and
as
he
flew
*NL*
the
edges
and
lining
of
his
wings
,
his
thighs
,
and
his
breast
were
*NL*
so
caught
by
the
bright
sunbeams
that
he
appeared
as
if
formed
of
*NL*
burnished
silver
.
Up
in
the
zenith
where
he
was
seemed
a
free
and
*NL*
happy
place
,
away
from
all
contact
with
the
earthly
ball
to
which
she
*NL*
was
pinioned
;
and
she
wished
that
she
could
arise
uncrushed
from
its
*NL*
surface
and
fly
as
he
flew
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
being
a
mother
,
it
was
inevitable
that
she
should
soon
cease
to
*NL*
ruminate
upon
her
own
condition
.
Had
the
track
of
her
next
thought
*NL*
been
marked
by
a
streak
in
the
air
,
like
the
path
of
a
meteor
,
*NL*
it
would
have
shown
a
direction
contrary
to
the
heron
's
,
and
have
*NL*
descended
to
the
eastward
upon
the
roof
of
Clym
's
house
.

VII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Tragic
Meeting
of
Two
Old
Friends
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
in
the
meantime
had
aroused
himself
from
sleep
,
sat
up
,
and
looked
*NL*
around
.
Eustacia
was
sitting
in
a
chair
hard
by
him
,
and
though
she
*NL*
held
a
book
in
her
hand
she
had
not
looked
into
it
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
indeed
!
''
said
Clym
,
brushing
his
eyes
with
his
hands
.
``
How
*NL*
soundly
I
have
slept
!
I
have
had
such
a
tremendous
dream
,
too
:
one
I
*NL*
shall
never
forget
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
had
been
dreaming
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
It
was
about
my
mother
.
I
dreamt
that
I
took
you
to
her
house
*NL*
to
make
up
differences
,
and
when
we
got
there
we
could
n't
get
in
,
*NL*
though
she
kept
on
crying
to
us
for
help
.
However
,
dreams
are
dreams
.
*NL*
What
o'clock
is
it
,
Eustacia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half-past
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
late
,
is
it
?
I
did
n't
mean
to
stay
so
long
.
By
the
time
I
have
*NL*
had
something
to
eat
it
will
be
after
three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ann
is
not
come
back
from
the
village
,
and
I
thought
I
would
let
you
*NL*
sleep
on
till
she
returned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
.
Presently
he
said
,
musingly
,
*NL*
``
Week
after
week
passes
,
and
yet
mother
does
not
come
.
I
thought
I
*NL*
should
have
heard
something
from
her
long
before
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Misgiving
,
regret
,
fear
,
resolution
,
ran
their
swift
course
of
*NL*
expression
in
Eustacia
's
dark
eyes
.
She
was
face
to
face
with
a
*NL*
monstrous
difficulty
,
and
she
resolved
to
get
free
of
it
by
*NL*
postponement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
certainly
go
to
Blooms-End
soon
,
''
he
continued
,
``
and
I
think
*NL*
I
had
better
go
alone
.
''
He
picked
up
his
leggings
and
gloves
,
threw
*NL*
them
down
again
,
and
added
,
``
As
dinner
will
be
so
late
today
I
will
*NL*
not
go
back
to
the
heath
,
but
work
in
the
garden
till
the
evening
,
and
*NL*
then
,
when
it
will
be
cooler
,
I
will
walk
to
Blooms-End
.
I
am
quite
*NL*
sure
that
if
I
make
a
little
advance
mother
will
be
willing
to
forget
*NL*
all
.
It
will
be
rather
late
before
I
can
get
home
,
as
I
shall
not
be
*NL*
able
to
do
the
distance
either
way
in
less
than
an
hour
and
a
half
.
*NL*
But
you
will
not
mind
for
one
evening
,
dear
?
What
are
you
thinking
of
*NL*
to
make
you
look
so
abstracted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
tell
you
,
''
she
said
heavily
.
``
I
wish
we
did
n't
live
here
,
*NL*
Clym
.
The
world
seems
all
wrong
in
this
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
if
we
make
it
so
.
I
wonder
if
Thomasin
has
been
to
Blooms-End
*NL*
lately
.
I
hope
so
.
But
probably
not
,
as
she
is
,
I
believe
,
expecting
*NL*
to
be
confined
in
a
month
or
so
.
I
wish
I
had
thought
of
that
before
.
*NL*
Poor
mother
must
indeed
be
very
lonely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
you
going
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
tonight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
may
be
said
which
will
terribly
injure
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
is
not
vindictive
,
''
said
Clym
,
his
colour
faintly
rising
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
wish
you
would
not
go
,
''
Eustacia
repeated
in
a
low
tone
.
``
If
*NL*
you
agree
not
to
go
tonight
I
promise
to
go
by
myself
to
her
house
*NL*
tomorrow
,
and
make
it
up
with
her
,
and
wait
till
you
fetch
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
want
to
do
that
at
this
particular
time
,
when
at
every
*NL*
previous
time
that
I
have
proposed
it
you
have
refused
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
explain
further
than
that
I
should
like
to
see
her
alone
*NL*
before
you
go
,
''
she
answered
,
with
an
impatient
move
of
her
head
,
and
*NL*
looking
at
him
with
an
anxiety
more
frequently
seen
upon
those
of
a
*NL*
sanguine
temperament
than
upon
such
as
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
very
odd
that
just
when
I
had
decided
to
go
myself
you
*NL*
should
want
to
do
what
I
proposed
long
ago
.
If
I
wait
for
you
to
go
*NL*
tomorrow
another
day
will
be
lost
;
and
I
know
I
shall
be
unable
to
*NL*
rest
another
night
without
having
been
.
I
want
to
get
this
settled
,
*NL*
and
will
.
You
must
visit
her
afterwards
:
it
will
be
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
even
go
with
you
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
scarcely
walk
there
and
back
without
a
longer
rest
than
I
*NL*
shall
take
.
No
,
not
tonight
,
Eustacia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
be
as
you
say
,
then
,
''
she
replied
in
the
quiet
way
of
one
who
,
*NL*
though
willing
to
ward
off
evil
consequences
by
a
mild
effort
,
would
*NL*
let
events
fall
out
as
they
might
sooner
than
wrestle
hard
to
direct
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
then
went
into
the
garden
;
and
a
thoughtful
languor
stole
over
*NL*
Eustacia
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
,
which
her
husband
*NL*
attributed
to
the
heat
of
the
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
he
set
out
on
the
journey
.
Although
the
heat
of
summer
*NL*
was
yet
intense
the
days
had
considerably
shortened
,
and
before
he
had
*NL*
advanced
a
mile
on
his
way
all
the
heath
purples
,
browns
,
and
greens
*NL*
had
merged
in
a
uniform
dress
without
airiness
or
graduation
,
and
*NL*
broken
only
by
touches
of
white
where
the
little
heaps
of
clean
quartz
*NL*
sand
showed
the
entrance
to
a
rabbit-burrow
,
or
where
the
white
flints
*NL*
of
a
footpath
lay
like
a
thread
over
the
slopes
.
In
almost
every
*NL*
one
of
the
isolated
and
stunted
thorns
which
grew
here
and
there
a
*NL*
night-hawk
revealed
his
presence
by
whirring
like
the
clack
of
a
mill
*NL*
as
long
as
he
could
hold
his
breath
,
then
stopping
,
flapping
his
*NL*
wings
,
wheeling
round
the
bush
,
alighting
,
and
after
a
silent
interval
*NL*
of
listening
beginning
to
whirr
again
.
At
each
brushing
of
Clym
's
*NL*
feet
white
miller-moths
flew
into
the
air
just
high
enough
to
catch
*NL*
upon
their
dusty
wings
the
mellowed
light
from
the
west
,
which
now
*NL*
shone
across
the
depressions
and
levels
of
the
ground
without
falling
*NL*
thereon
to
light
them
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
walked
on
amid
this
quiet
scene
with
a
hope
that
all
would
*NL*
soon
be
well
.
Three
miles
on
he
came
to
a
spot
where
a
soft
perfume
*NL*
was
wafted
across
his
path
,
and
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
to
*NL*
inhale
the
familiar
scent
.
It
was
the
place
at
which
,
four
hours
*NL*
earlier
,
his
mother
had
sat
down
exhausted
on
the
knoll
covered
with
*NL*
shepherd
's
-
thyme
.
While
he
stood
a
sound
between
a
breathing
and
a
*NL*
moan
suddenly
reached
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
to
where
the
sound
came
from
;
but
nothing
appeared
there
*NL*
save
the
verge
of
the
hillock
stretching
against
the
sky
in
an
*NL*
unbroken
line
.
He
moved
a
few
steps
in
that
direction
,
and
now
he
*NL*
perceived
a
recumbent
figure
almost
close
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
different
possibilities
as
to
the
person
's
individuality
*NL*
there
did
not
for
a
moment
occur
to
Yeobright
that
it
might
be
one
of
*NL*
his
own
family
.
Sometimes
furze-cutters
had
been
known
to
sleep
out
of
*NL*
doors
at
these
times
,
to
save
a
long
journey
homeward
and
back
again
;
*NL*
but
Clym
remembered
the
moan
and
looked
closer
,
and
saw
that
the
form
*NL*
was
feminine
;
and
a
distress
came
over
him
like
cold
air
from
a
cave
.
*NL*
But
he
was
not
absolutely
certain
that
the
woman
was
his
mother
till
*NL*
he
stooped
and
beheld
her
face
,
pallid
,
and
with
closed
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
breath
went
,
as
it
were
,
out
of
his
body
and
the
cry
of
anguish
*NL*
which
would
have
escaped
him
died
upon
his
lips
.
During
the
momentary
*NL*
interval
that
elapsed
before
he
became
conscious
that
something
must
*NL*
be
done
all
sense
of
time
and
place
left
him
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
*NL*
he
and
his
mother
were
as
when
he
was
a
child
with
her
many
years
*NL*
ago
on
this
heath
at
hours
similar
to
the
present
.
Then
he
awoke
to
*NL*
activity
;
and
bending
yet
lower
he
found
that
she
still
breathed
,
and
*NL*
that
her
breath
though
feeble
was
regular
,
except
when
disturbed
by
an
*NL*
occasional
gasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
what
is
it
!
Mother
,
are
you
very
ill
--
you
are
not
dying
?
''
he
*NL*
cried
,
pressing
his
lips
to
her
face
.
``
I
am
your
Clym
.
How
did
you
*NL*
come
here
?
What
does
it
all
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
chasm
in
their
lives
which
his
love
for
Eustacia
*NL*
had
caused
was
not
remembered
by
Yeobright
,
and
to
him
the
present
*NL*
joined
continuously
with
that
friendly
past
that
had
been
their
*NL*
experience
before
the
division
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
moved
her
lips
,
appeared
to
know
him
,
but
could
not
speak
;
and
*NL*
then
Clym
strove
to
consider
how
best
to
move
her
,
as
it
would
be
*NL*
necessary
to
get
her
away
from
the
spot
before
the
dews
were
intense
.
*NL*
He
was
able-bodied
,
and
his
mother
was
thin
.
He
clasped
his
arms
*NL*
round
her
,
lifted
her
a
little
,
and
said
,
``
Does
that
hurt
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
,
and
he
lifted
her
up
;
then
,
at
a
slow
pace
,
went
*NL*
onward
with
his
load
.
The
air
was
now
completely
cool
;
but
whenever
*NL*
he
passed
over
a
sandy
patch
of
ground
uncarpeted
with
vegetation
*NL*
there
was
reflected
from
its
surface
into
his
face
the
heat
which
it
*NL*
had
imbibed
during
the
day
.
At
the
beginning
of
his
undertaking
he
*NL*
had
thought
but
little
of
the
distance
which
yet
would
have
to
be
*NL*
traversed
before
Blooms-End
could
be
reached
;
but
though
he
had
slept
*NL*
that
afternoon
he
soon
began
to
feel
the
weight
of
his
burden
.
Thus
*NL*
he
proceeded
,
like
Aeneas
with
his
father
;
the
bats
circling
round
his
*NL*
head
,
nightjars
flapping
their
wings
within
a
yard
of
his
face
,
and
*NL*
not
a
human
being
within
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
yet
nearly
a
mile
from
the
house
his
mother
exhibited
*NL*
signs
of
restlessness
under
the
constraint
of
being
borne
along
,
as
*NL*
if
his
arms
were
irksome
to
her
.
He
lowered
her
upon
his
knees
and
*NL*
looked
around
.
The
point
they
had
now
reached
,
though
far
from
any
*NL*
road
,
was
not
more
than
a
mile
from
the
Blooms-End
cottages
occupied
*NL*
by
Fairway
,
Sam
,
Humphrey
,
and
the
Cantles
.
Moreover
,
fifty
yards
off
*NL*
stood
a
hut
,
built
of
clods
and
covered
with
thin
turves
,
but
now
*NL*
entirely
disused
.
The
simple
outline
of
the
lonely
shed
was
visible
,
*NL*
and
thither
he
determined
to
direct
his
steps
.
As
soon
as
he
arrived
*NL*
he
laid
her
down
carefully
by
the
entrance
,
and
then
ran
and
cut
with
*NL*
his
pocketknife
an
armful
of
the
dryest
fern
.
Spreading
this
within
*NL*
the
shed
,
which
was
entirely
open
on
one
side
,
he
placed
his
mother
*NL*
thereon
;
then
he
ran
with
all
his
might
towards
the
dwelling
of
*NL*
Fairway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
,
disturbed
only
by
the
broken
*NL*
breathing
of
the
sufferer
,
when
moving
figures
began
to
animate
the
*NL*
line
between
heath
and
sky
.
In
a
few
moments
Clym
arrived
with
*NL*
Fairway
,
Humphrey
,
and
Susan
Nunsuch
;
Olly
Dowden
,
who
had
chanced
*NL*
to
be
at
Fairway
's
,
Christian
and
Grandfer
Cantle
following
*NL*
helter-skelter
behind
.
They
had
brought
a
lantern
and
matches
,
water
,
*NL*
a
pillow
,
and
a
few
other
articles
which
had
occurred
to
their
minds
*NL*
in
the
hurry
of
the
moment
.
Sam
had
been
despatched
back
again
for
*NL*
brandy
,
and
a
boy
brought
Fairway
's
pony
,
upon
which
he
rode
off
to
*NL*
the
nearest
medical
man
,
with
directions
to
call
at
Wildeve
's
on
his
*NL*
way
,
and
inform
Thomasin
that
her
aunt
was
unwell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sam
and
the
brandy
soon
arrived
,
and
it
was
administered
by
the
light
*NL*
of
the
lantern
;
after
which
she
became
sufficiently
conscious
to
*NL*
signify
by
signs
that
something
was
wrong
with
her
foot
.
Olly
Dowden
*NL*
at
length
understood
her
meaning
,
and
examined
the
foot
indicated
.
It
*NL*
was
swollen
and
red
.
Even
as
they
watched
the
red
began
to
assume
a
*NL*
more
livid
colour
,
in
the
midst
of
which
appeared
a
scarlet
speck
,
*NL*
smaller
than
a
pea
,
and
it
was
found
to
consist
of
a
drop
of
blood
,
*NL*
which
rose
above
the
smooth
flesh
of
her
ankle
in
a
hemisphere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
it
is
,
''
cried
Sam
.
``
She
has
been
stung
by
an
adder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Clym
instantly
.
``
I
remember
when
I
was
a
child
seeing
*NL*
just
such
a
bite
.
O
,
my
poor
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
father
who
was
bit
,
''
said
Sam
.
``
And
there
's
only
one
way
*NL*
to
cure
it
.
You
must
rub
the
place
with
the
fat
of
other
adders
,
and
*NL*
the
only
way
to
get
that
is
by
frying
them
.
That
's
what
they
did
for
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
an
old
remedy
,
''
said
Clym
distrustfully
,
``
and
I
have
doubts
*NL*
about
it
.
But
we
can
do
nothing
else
till
the
doctor
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
sure
cure
,
''
said
Olly
Dowden
,
with
emphasis
.
``
I
've
used
it
*NL*
when
I
used
to
go
out
nursing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
must
pray
for
daylight
,
to
catch
them
,
''
said
Clym
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
see
what
I
can
do
,
''
said
Sam
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
green
hazel
which
he
had
used
as
a
walking-stick
,
split
it
*NL*
at
the
end
,
inserted
a
small
pebble
,
and
with
the
lantern
in
his
hand
*NL*
went
out
into
the
heath
.
Clym
had
by
this
time
lit
a
small
fire
,
and
*NL*
despatched
Susan
Nunsuch
for
a
frying-pan
.
Before
she
had
returned
*NL*
Sam
came
in
with
three
adders
,
one
briskly
coiling
and
uncoiling
in
*NL*
the
cleft
of
the
stick
,
and
the
other
two
hanging
dead
across
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
been
able
to
get
one
alive
and
fresh
as
he
ought
to
be
,
''
*NL*
said
Sam
.
``
These
limp
ones
are
two
I
killed
today
at
work
;
but
as
*NL*
they
do
n't
die
till
the
sun
goes
down
they
ca
n't
be
very
stale
meat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
live
adder
regarded
the
assembled
group
with
a
sinister
look
in
*NL*
its
small
black
eye
,
and
the
beautiful
brown
and
jet
pattern
on
its
*NL*
back
seemed
to
intensify
with
indignation
.
Mrs.
Yeobright
saw
the
*NL*
creature
,
and
the
creature
saw
her
:
she
quivered
throughout
,
and
*NL*
averted
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
that
,
''
murmured
Christian
Cantle
.
``
Neighbours
,
how
do
we
*NL*
know
but
that
something
of
the
old
serpent
in
God

gied
*NL*
the
apple
to
the
young
woman
with
no
clothes
,
lives
on
in
adders
and
*NL*
snakes
still

Look
at
his
eye

for
all
the
world
like
a
villainous
*NL*
sort
of
black
currant

'T
is
to

There

another

Well

is
right

be
afeard
of
things

Grandfer
Cantle

I
fancy
I
heard
something
outside
the
shed

Christian
.
``
I
wish
*NL*
troubles
would
come
in
the
daytime

hardly
beg
for
mercy

the
most
broomstick
old
woman

*NL*
should
see

was
a
brave

able
to
run
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
such
an
ignorant
fellow
as
I
should
know

Sam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

calamities

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said
Grandfer
Cantle
.

Such
is
my
spirit
when

perhaps
't
is
natural
in

trained
for
war

*NL*
Yes

I
've
gone
through
a
good
deal
;
but
nothing
ever
came
amiss
to
me
*NL*
after
I
joined

Locals
in
four

''
He
shook
his
head
and
smiled
at
a
*NL*
mental
picture
of
himself
in
uniform
.
``
I
was
always
first
in
the
most
*NL*
galliantest
scrapes
in
my
younger
days

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
was
because
they
always
used
to
put

biggest
fool

afore

said
Fairway
from
the
fire
,
beside
which
he
knelt
,
blowing
it
*NL*
with
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'ye
think
so
,
Timothy
?
''
said
Grandfer
Cantle
,
coming
forward
to
*NL*
Fairway
's
side
with
sudden
depression
in
his
face
.
``
Then
a
man
may
*NL*
feel
for
years
that
he
is
good
solid
company

be
wrong
about

himself
after
all
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
that
question
,
Grandfer
.
Stir
your
stumps

get
some
*NL*
more
sticks

'T
is
very
nonsense
of
an
old
man
to
prattle
so
when
life
*NL*
and
death
's
in
mangling

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

said
Grandfer
Cantle
,
with
melancholy
conviction
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
this
is
a
bad
night
altogether
for
them
that
have
done
well
in
their
*NL*
time

and
if
I
were
ever
such
a
dab
at
the
hautboy

tenor-viol
,
I
*NL*
should

have
the
heart

*NL*
*NL*
Susan
now
arrived
with
the
frying-pan
,
when
the
live
adder
was
killed
*NL*
and
the
heads
of
the
three
taken
off
.
The
remainders
,
being
cut
into
*NL*
lengths
and
split
open
,
were
tossed
into
the
pan
,
which
began
hissing
*NL*
and
crackling
over
the
fire
.
Soon
a
rill
of
clear
oil
trickled
from
*NL*
the
carcases
,
whereupon
Clym
dipped
the
corner
of
his
handkerchief
*NL*
into
the
liquid
and
anointed
the
wound

*NL*
Eustacia
Hears
of
Good
Fortune
,
and
Beholds
Evil
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
Eustacia
,
left
alone
in
her
cottage
at
Alderworth
,
*NL*
had
become
considerably
depressed
by
the
posture
of
affairs
.
The
*NL*
consequences
which
might
result
from
Clym
's
discovery
that
his
mother
*NL*
had
been
turned
from
his
door
that
day
were
likely
to
be
disagreeable
,
*NL*
and
this
was
a
quality
in
events
which
she
hated
as
much
as
the
*NL*
dreadful
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
left
to
pass
the
evening
by
herself
was
irksome
to
her
at
any
*NL*
time
,
and
this
evening
it
was
more
irksome
than
usual
by
reason
of
the
*NL*
excitements
of
the
past
hours
.
The
two
visits
had
stirred
her
into
*NL*
restlessness
.
She
was
not
wrought
to
any
great
pitch
of
uneasiness
*NL*
by
the
probability
of
appearing
in
an
ill
light
in
the
discussion
*NL*
between
Clym
and
his
mother
,
but
she
was
wrought
to
vexation
;
and
her
*NL*
slumbering
activities
were
quickened
to
the
extent
of
wishing
that
she
*NL*
had
opened
the
door
.
She
had
certainly
believed
that
Clym
was
awake
,
*NL*
and
the
excuse
would
be
an
honest
one
as
far
as
it
went
;
but
nothing
*NL*
could
save
her
from
censure
in
refusing
to
answer
at
the
first
knock
.
*NL*
Yet
,
instead
of
blaming
herself
for
the
issue
she
laid
the
fault
upon
*NL*
the
shoulders
of
some
indistinct
,
colossal
Prince
of
the
World
,
who
*NL*
had
framed
her
situation
and
ruled
her
lot
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
of
the
year
it
was
pleasanter
to
walk
by
night
than
by
*NL*
day
,
and
when
Clym
had
been
absent
about
an
hour
she
suddenly
resolved
*NL*
to
go
out
in
the
direction
of
Blooms-End
,
on
the
chance
of
meeting
*NL*
him
on
his
return
.
When
she
reached
the
garden
gate
she
heard
wheels
*NL*
approaching
,
and
looking
round
beheld
her
grandfather
coming
up
in
his
*NL*
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stay
a
minute
,
thank
ye
,
''
he
answered
to
her
greeting
.
``
I
*NL*
am
driving
to
East
Egdon
;
but
I
came
round
here
just
to
tell
you
the
*NL*
news
.
Perhaps
you
have
heard
--
about
Mr.
Wildeve
's
fortune
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Eustacia
blankly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
has
come
into
a
fortune
of
eleven
thousand
pounds
--
uncle
*NL*
died
in
Canada
,
just
after
hearing
that
all
his
family
,
whom
he
was
*NL*
sending
home
,
had
gone
to
the
bottom
in
the
_
Cassiopeia
_
;
so
Wildeve
*NL*
has
come
into
everything
,
without
in
the
least
expecting
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
stood
motionless
awhile
.
``
How
long
has
he
known
of
this
?
''
*NL*
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
known
to
him
this
morning
early
,
for
I
knew
it
at
ten
*NL*
o'clock
,
when
Charley
came
back
.
Now
,
he
is
what
I
call
a
lucky
man
.
*NL*
What
a
fool
you
were
,
Eustacia
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
?
''
she
said
,
lifting
her
eyes
in
apparent
calmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
in
not
sticking
to
him
when
you
had
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
him
,
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
there
had
ever
been
anything
between
you
till
lately
;
*NL*
and
,
faith
,
I
should
have
been
hot
and
strong
against
it
if
I
had
*NL*
known
;
but
since
it
seems
that
there
was
some
sniffing
between
ye
,
why
*NL*
the
deuce
did
n't
you
stick
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
made
no
reply
,
but
she
looked
as
if
she
could
say
as
much
*NL*
upon
that
subject
as
he
if
she
chose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
is
your
poor
purblind
husband
?
''
continued
the
old
man
.
``
Not
*NL*
a
bad
fellow
either
,
as
far
as
he
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
quite
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
good
thing
for
his
cousin
what-d'ye-call-her
?
By
George
,
you
*NL*
ought
to
have
been
in
that
galley
,
my
girl
!
Now
I
must
drive
on
.
Do
*NL*
you
want
any
assistance
?
What
's
mine
is
yours
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
grandfather
,
we
are
not
in
want
at
present
,
''
she
said
*NL*
coldly
.
``
Clym
cuts
furze
,
but
he
does
it
mostly
as
a
useful
pastime
,
*NL*
because
he
can
do
nothing
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
paid
for
his
pastime
,
is
n't
he
?
Three
shillings
a
hundred
,
I
*NL*
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clym
has
money
,
''
she
said
,
colouring
,
``
but
he
likes
to
earn
a
*NL*
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
good
night
.
''
And
the
captain
drove
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
grandfather
was
gone
Eustacia
went
on
her
way
mechanically
;
*NL*
but
her
thoughts
were
no
longer
concerning
her
mother-in-law
and
Clym
.
*NL*
Wildeve
,
notwithstanding
his
complaints
against
his
fate
,
had
been
*NL*
seized
upon
by
destiny
and
placed
in
the
sunshine
once
more
.
Eleven
*NL*
thousand
pounds
!
From
every
Egdon
point
of
view
he
was
a
rich
man
.
In
*NL*
Eustacia
's
eyes
,
too
,
it
was
an
ample
sum
--
one
sufficient
to
supply
*NL*
those
wants
of
hers
which
had
been
stigmatized
by
Clym
in
his
more
*NL*
austere
moods
as
vain
and
luxurious
.
Though
she
was
no
lover
of
*NL*
money
she
loved
what
money
could
bring
;
and
the
new
accessories
she
*NL*
imagined
around
him
clothed
Wildeve
with
a
great
deal
of
interest
.
She
*NL*
recollected
now
how
quietly
well-dressed
he
had
been
that
morning
:
he
*NL*
had
probably
put
on
his
newest
suit
,
regardless
of
damage
by
briars
*NL*
and
thorns
.
And
then
she
thought
of
his
manner
towards
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
I
see
it
,
I
see
it
,
''
she
said
.
``
How
much
he
wishes
he
had
me
now
,
*NL*
that
he
might
give
me
all
I
desire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
recalling
the
details
of
his
glances
and
words
--
at
the
time
*NL*
scarcely
regarded
--
it
became
plain
to
her
how
greatly
they
had
been
*NL*
dictated
by
his
knowledge
of
this
new
event
.
``
Had
he
been
a
man
to
*NL*
bear
a
jilt
ill-will
he
would
have
told
me
of
his
good
fortune
in
*NL*
crowing
tones
;
instead
of
doing
that
he
mentioned
not
a
word
,
in
*NL*
deference
to
my
misfortunes
,
and
merely
implied
that
he
loved
me
*NL*
still
,
as
one
superior
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
's
silence
that
day
on
what
had
happened
to
him
was
just
the
*NL*
kind
of
behaviour
calculated
to
make
an
impression
on
such
a
woman
.
*NL*
Those
delicate
touches
of
good
taste
were
,
in
fact
,
one
of
the
strong
*NL*
points
in
his
demeanour
towards
the
other
sex
.
The
peculiarity
of
*NL*
Wildeve
was
that
,
while
at
one
time
passionate
,
upbraiding
,
and
*NL*
resentful
towards
a
woman
,
at
another
he
would
treat
her
with
*NL*
such
unparalleled
grace
as
to
make
previous
neglect
appear
as
*NL*
no
discourtesy
,
injury
as
no
insult
,
interference
as
a
delicate
*NL*
attention
,
and
the
ruin
of
her
honour
as
excess
of
chivalry
.
This
*NL*
man
,
whose
admiration
today
Eustacia
had
disregarded
,
whose
good
*NL*
wishes
she
had
scarcely
taken
the
trouble
to
accept
,
whom
she
had
*NL*
shown
out
of
the
house
by
the
back
door
,
was
the
possessor
of
eleven
*NL*
thousand
pounds
--
a
man
of
fair
professional
education
,
and
one
who
*NL*
had
served
his
articles
with
a
civil
engineer
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
intent
was
Eustacia
upon
Wildeve
's
fortunes
that
she
forgot
how
*NL*
much
closer
to
her
own
course
were
those
of
Clym
;
and
instead
of
*NL*
walking
on
to
meet
him
at
once
she
sat
down
upon
a
stone
.
She
was
*NL*
disturbed
in
her
reverie
by
a
voice
behind
,
and
turning
her
head
*NL*
beheld
the
old
lover
and
fortunate
inheritor
of
wealth
immediately
*NL*
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
sitting
,
though
the
fluctuation
in
her
look
might
have
*NL*
told
any
man
who
knew
her
so
well
as
Wildeve
that
she
was
thinking
of
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
come
here
?
''
she
said
in
her
clear
low
tone
.
``
I
thought
*NL*
you
were
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
on
to
the
village
after
leaving
your
garden
;
and
now
I
have
*NL*
come
back
again
:
that
's
all
.
Which
way
are
you
walking
,
may
I
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
waved
her
hand
in
the
direction
of
Blooms-End
.
``
I
am
going
to
meet
*NL*
my
husband
.
I
think
I
may
possibly
have
got
into
trouble
whilst
you
*NL*
were
with
me
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
that
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
not
letting
in
Mrs.
Yeobright
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
that
visit
of
mine
did
you
no
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
.
It
was
not
your
fault
,
''
she
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
she
had
risen
;
and
they
involuntarily
sauntered
on
*NL*
together
,
without
speaking
,
for
two
or
three
minutes
;
when
Eustacia
*NL*
broke
silence
by
saying
,
``
I
assume
I
must
congratulate
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
what
?
O
yes
;
on
my
eleven
thousand
pounds
,
you
mean
.
Well
,
since
*NL*
I
did
n't
get
something
else
,
I
must
be
content
with
getting
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
very
indifferent
about
it
.
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
today
*NL*
when
you
came
?
''
she
said
in
the
tone
of
a
neglected
person
.
``
I
heard
*NL*
of
it
quite
by
accident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
mean
to
tell
you
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
``
But
I
--
well
,
I
will
speak
*NL*
frankly
--
I
did
not
like
to
mention
it
when
I
saw
,
Eustacia
,
that
your
*NL*
star
was
not
high
.
The
sight
of
a
man
lying
wearied
out
with
hard
*NL*
work
,
as
your
husband
lay
,
made
me
feel
that
to
brag
of
my
own
fortune
*NL*
to
you
would
be
greatly
out
of
place
.
Yet
,
as
you
stood
there
beside
*NL*
him
,
I
could
not
help
feeling
too
that
in
many
respects
he
was
a
*NL*
richer
man
than
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Eustacia
said
,
with
slumbering
mischievousness
,
``
What
,
would
*NL*
you
exchange
with
him
--
your
fortune
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
would
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
we
are
imagining
what
is
impossible
and
absurd
,
suppose
we
change
*NL*
the
subject
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
and
I
will
tell
you
of
my
plans
for
the
future
,
if
you
*NL*
care
to
hear
them
.
I
shall
permanently
invest
nine
thousand
pounds
,
*NL*
keep
one
thousand
as
ready
money
,
and
with
the
remaining
thousand
*NL*
travel
for
a
year
or
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Travel
?
What
a
bright
idea
!
Where
will
you
go
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
here
to
Paris
,
where
I
shall
pass
the
winter
and
spring
.
Then
*NL*
I
shall
go
to
Italy
,
Greece
,
Egypt
,
and
Palestine
,
before
the
hot
*NL*
weather
comes
on
.
In
the
summer
I
shall
go
to
America
;
and
then
,
by
a
*NL*
plan
not
yet
settled
,
I
shall
go
to
Australia
and
round
to
India
.
By
*NL*
that
time
I
shall
have
begun
to
have
had
enough
of
it
.
Then
I
shall
*NL*
probably
come
back
to
Paris
again
,
and
there
I
shall
stay
as
long
as
*NL*
I
can
afford
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Back
to
Paris
again
,
''
she
murmured
in
a
voice
that
was
nearly
a
sigh
.
*NL*
She
had
never
once
told
Wildeve
of
the
Parisian
desires
which
Clym
's
*NL*
description
had
sown
in
her
;
yet
here
was
he
involuntarily
in
a
*NL*
position
to
gratify
them
.
``
You
think
a
good
deal
of
Paris
?
''
she
*NL*
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
In
my
opinion
it
is
the
central
beauty-spot
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
mine
!
And
Thomasin
will
go
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
she
cares
to
.
She
may
prefer
to
stay
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
will
be
going
about
,
and
I
shall
be
staying
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
will
.
But
we
know
whose
fault
that
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
blaming
you
,
''
she
said
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
thought
you
were
.
If
ever
you
SHOULD
be
inclined
to
blame
me
,
*NL*
think
of
a
certain
evening
by
Rainbarrow
,
when
you
promised
to
meet
*NL*
me
and
did
not
.
You
sent
me
a
letter
;
and
my
heart
ached
to
read
that
*NL*
as
I
hope
yours
never
will
.
That
was
one
point
of
divergence
.
I
then
*NL*
did
something
in
haste
...
But
she
is
a
good
woman
,
and
I
will
say
no
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
the
blame
was
on
my
side
that
time
,
''
said
Eustacia
.
``
But
*NL*
it
had
not
always
been
so
.
However
,
it
is
my
misfortune
to
be
too
*NL*
sudden
in
feeling
.
O
,
Damon
,
do
n't
reproach
me
any
more
--
I
ca
n't
bear
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
on
silently
for
a
distance
of
two
or
three
miles
,
when
*NL*
Eustacia
said
suddenly
,
``
Have
n't
you
come
out
of
your
way
,
Mr.
*NL*
Wildeve
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
way
is
anywhere
tonight
.
I
will
go
with
you
as
far
as
the
hill
*NL*
on
which
we
can
see
Blooms-End
,
as
it
is
getting
late
for
you
to
be
*NL*
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
trouble
.
I
am
not
obliged
to
be
out
at
all
.
I
think
I
would
*NL*
rather
you
did
not
accompany
me
further
.
This
sort
of
thing
would
*NL*
have
an
odd
look
if
known
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
I
will
leave
you
.
''
He
took
her
hand
unexpectedly
,
and
*NL*
kissed
it
--
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
.
``
What
light
is
that
*NL*
on
the
hill
?
''
he
added
,
as
it
were
to
hide
the
caress
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
,
and
saw
a
flickering
firelight
proceeding
from
the
open
*NL*
side
of
a
hovel
a
little
way
before
them
.
The
hovel
,
which
she
had
*NL*
hitherto
always
found
empty
,
seemed
to
be
inhabited
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
you
have
come
so
far
,
''
said
Eustacia
,
``
will
you
see
me
safely
*NL*
past
that
hut
?
I
thought
I
should
have
met
Clym
somewhere
about
here
,
*NL*
but
as
he
does
n't
appear
I
will
hasten
on
and
get
to
Blooms-End
before
*NL*
he
leaves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
advanced
to
the
turf-shed
,
and
when
they
got
near
it
the
*NL*
firelight
and
the
lantern
inside
showed
distinctly
enough
the
form
of
*NL*
a
woman
reclining
on
a
bed
of
fern
,
a
group
of
heath
men
and
women
*NL*
standing
around
her
.
Eustacia
did
not
recognize
Mrs.
Yeobright
in
the
*NL*
reclining
figure
,
nor
Clym
as
one
of
the
standers-by
till
she
came
*NL*
close
.
Then
she
quickly
pressed
her
hand
upon
Wildeve
's
arm
and
*NL*
signified
to
him
to
come
back
from
the
open
side
of
the
shed
into
the
*NL*
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
husband
and
his
mother
,
''
she
whispered
in
an
agitated
voice
.
*NL*
``
What
can
it
mean
?
Will
you
step
forward
and
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
left
her
side
and
went
to
the
back
wall
of
the
hut
.
Presently
*NL*
Eustacia
perceived
that
he
was
beckoning
to
her
,
and
she
advanced
and
*NL*
joined
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
serious
case
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
their
position
they
could
hear
what
was
proceeding
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
think
where
she
could
have
been
going
,
''
said
Clym
to
*NL*
some
one
.
``
She
had
evidently
walked
a
long
way
,
but
even
when
she
*NL*
was
able
to
speak
just
now
she
would
not
tell
me
where
.
What
do
you
*NL*
really
think
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
great
deal
to
fear
,
''
was
gravely
answered
,
in
a
voice
*NL*
which
Eustacia
recognized
as
that
of
the
only
surgeon
in
the
district
.
*NL*
``
She
has
suffered
somewhat
from
the
bite
of
the
adder
;
but
it
is
*NL*
exhaustion
which
has
overpowered
her
.
My
impression
is
that
her
walk
*NL*
must
have
been
exceptionally
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
tell
her
not
to
overwalk
herself
this
weather
,
''
said
Clym
,
*NL*
with
distress
.
``
Do
you
think
we
did
well
in
using
the
adder
's
fat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
a
very
ancient
remedy
--
the
old
remedy
of
the
*NL*
viper-catchers
,
I
believe
,
''
replied
the
doctor
.
``
It
is
mentioned
as
an
*NL*
infallible
ointment
by
Hoffman
,
Mead
,
and
I
think
the
Abbe
Fontana
.
*NL*
Undoubtedly
it
was
as
good
a
thing
as
you
could
do
;
though
I
question
*NL*
if
some
other
oils
would
not
have
been

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
come
here
!
''
was
then
rapidly
said
in
anxious
female
tones
;
*NL*
and
Clym
and
the
doctor
could
be
heard
rushing
forward
from
the
back
*NL*
part
of
the
shed
to
where
Mrs.
Yeobright
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
is
it
?
''
whispered
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
Thomasin
who
spoke
,
''
said
Wildeve
.
``
Then
they
have
fetched
*NL*
her
.
I
wonder
if
I
had
better
go
in
--
yet
it
might
do
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
there
was
utter
silence
among
the
group
within
;
and
it
*NL*
was
broken
at
last
by
Clym
saying
,
in
an
agonized
voice
,
``
O
Doctor
,
*NL*
what
does
it
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
did
not
reply
at
once
;
ultimately
he
said
,
``
She
is
sinking
*NL*
fast
.
Her
heart
was
previously
affected
,
and
physical
exhaustion
has
*NL*
dealt
the
finishing
blow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
a
weeping
of
women
,
then
waiting
,
then
hushed
*NL*
exclamations
,
then
a
strange
gasping
sound
,
then
a
painful
stillness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
over
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Further
back
in
the
hut
the
cotters
whispered
,
``
Mrs.
Yeobright
is
*NL*
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
at
the
same
moment
the
two
watchers
observed
the
form
of
a
*NL*
small
old-fashioned
child
entering
at
the
open
side
of
the
shed
.
*NL*
Susan
Nunsuch
,
whose
boy
it
was
,
went
forward
to
the
opening
and
*NL*
silently
beckoned
to
him
to
go
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
something
to
tell
`
ee
,
mother
,
''
he
cried
in
a
shrill
tone
.
*NL*
``
That
woman
asleep
there
walked
along
with
me
today
;
and
she
said
I
*NL*
was
to
say
that
I
had
seed
her
,
and
she
was
a
broken-hearted
woman
and
*NL*
cast
off
by
her
son
,
and
then
I
came
on
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
confused
sob
as
from
a
man
was
heard
within
,
upon
which
Eustacia
*NL*
gasped
faintly
,
``
That
's
Clym
--
I
must
go
to
him
--
yet
dare
I
do
it
?
*NL*
No
:
come
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
withdrawn
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
shed
she
said
*NL*
huskily
,
``
I
am
to
blame
for
this
.
There
is
evil
in
store
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
she
not
admitted
to
your
house
after
all
?
''
Wildeve
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
and
that
's
where
it
all
lies
!
Oh
,
what
shall
I
do
!
I
shall
not
*NL*
intrude
upon
them
:
I
shall
go
straight
home
.
Damon
,
good-bye
!
I
*NL*
can
not
speak
to
you
any
more
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
parted
company
;
and
when
Eustacia
had
reached
the
next
hill
she
*NL*
looked
back
.
A
melancholy
procession
was
wending
its
way
by
the
light
*NL*
of
the
lantern
from
the
hut
towards
Blooms-End
.
Wildeve
was
nowhere
to
*NL*
be
seen

One
evening
,
about
three
weeks
after
the
funeral
of
Mrs.
Yeobright
,
*NL*
when
the
silver
face
of
the
moon
sent
a
bundle
of
beams
directly
upon
*NL*
the
floor
of
Clym
's
house
at
Alderworth
,
a
woman
came
forth
from
*NL*
within
.
She
reclined
over
the
garden
gate
as
if
to
refresh
herself
*NL*
awhile
.
The
pale
lunar
touches
which
make
beauties
of
hags
lent
*NL*
divinity
to
this
face
,
already
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
long
been
there
when
a
man
came
up
the
road
and
with
some
*NL*
hesitation
said
to
her
,
``
How
is
he
tonight
,
ma'am
,
if
you
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
better
,
though
still
very
unwell

''
replied
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
light-headed
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
He
is
quite
sensible
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
he
rave
about
his

just
the

''
continued
*NL*
Humphrey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
much
,
though
not
quite
so
wildly
,
''
she
said
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
very
unfortunate
,
ma'am
,
that
the
boy
Johnny
should
ever
ha
'
*NL*
told
him
his
mother
's
dying
words
,
about
her
being
broken-hearted
and
*NL*
cast
off
by
her
son
.
'T
was
enough
to
upset
any
man
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
made
no
reply
beyond
that
of
a
slight
catch
in
her
breath
,
as
*NL*
of
one
who
fain
would
speak
but
could
not
;
and
Humphrey
,
declining
her
*NL*
invitation
to
come
in
,
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
turned
,
entered
the
house
,
and
ascended
to
the
front
bedroom
,
*NL*
where
a
shaded
light
was
burning
.
In
the
bed
lay
Clym
,
pale
,
haggard
,
*NL*
wide
awake
,
tossing
to
one
side
and
to
the
other
,
his
eyes
lit
by
*NL*
a
hot
light
,
as
if
the
fire
in
their
pupils
were
burning
up
their
*NL*
substance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
you
,
Eustacia
?
''
he
said
as
she
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Clym
.
I
have
been
down
to
the
gate
.
The
moon
is
shining
*NL*
beautifully
,
and
there
is
not
a
leaf
stirring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shining
,
is
it
?
What
's
the
moon
to
a
man
like
me
?
Let
it
shine
--
let
*NL*
anything
be
,
so
that
I
never
see
another
day
!
...
Eustacia
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
where
to
look
:
my
thoughts
go
through
me
like
swords
.
O
,
if
*NL*
any
man
wants
to
make
himself
immortal
by
painting
a
picture
of
*NL*
wretchedness
,
let
him
come
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
help
feeling
that
I
did
my
best
to
kill
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Clym
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
so
;
it
is
useless
to
excuse
me
!
My
conduct
to
her
was
*NL*
too
hideous
--
I
made
no
advances
;
and
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
*NL*
forgive
me
.
Now
she
is
dead
!
If
I
had
only
shown
myself
willing
to
*NL*
make
it
up
with
her
sooner
,
and
we
had
been
friends
,
and
then
she
*NL*
had
died
,
it
would
n't
be
so
hard
to
bear
.
But
I
never
went
near
her
*NL*
house
,
so
she
never
came
near
mine
,
and
did
n't
know
how
welcome
she
*NL*
would
have
been
--
that
's
what
troubles
me
.
She
did
not
know
I
was
*NL*
going
to
her
house
that
very
night
,
for
she
was
too
insensible
to
*NL*
understand
me
.
If
she
had
only
come
to
see
me
!
I
longed
that
she
*NL*
would
.
But
it
was
not
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
escaped
from
Eustacia
one
of
those
shivering
sighs
which
used
*NL*
to
shake
her
like
a
pestilent
blast
.
She
had
not
yet
told
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Yeobright
was
too
deeply
absorbed
in
the
ramblings
incidental
to
*NL*
his
remorseful
state
to
notice
her
.
During
his
illness
he
had
been
*NL*
continually
talking
thus
.
Despair
had
been
added
to
his
original
*NL*
grief
by
the
unfortunate
disclosure
of
the
boy
who
had
received
the
*NL*
last
words
of
Mrs.
Yeobright
--
words
too
bitterly
uttered
in
an
hour
of
*NL*
misapprehension
.
Then
his
distress
had
overwhelmed
him
,
and
he
longed
*NL*
for
death
as
a
field
labourer
longs
for
the
shade
.
It
was
the
pitiful
*NL*
sight
of
a
man
standing
in
the
very
focus
of
sorrow
.
He
continually
*NL*
bewailed
his
tardy
journey
to
his
mother
's
house
,
because
it
was
an
*NL*
error
which
could
never
be
rectified
,
and
insisted
that
he
must
have
*NL*
been
horribly
perverted
by
some
fiend
not
to
have
thought
before
that
*NL*
it
was
his
duty
to
go
to
her
,
since
she
did
not
come
to
him
.
He
would
*NL*
ask
Eustacia
to
agree
with
him
in
his
self-condemnation
;
and
when
she
,
*NL*
seared
inwardly
by
a
secret
she
dared
not
tell
,
declared
that
she
*NL*
could
not
give
an
opinion
,
he
would
say
,
``
That
's
because
you
did
n't
*NL*
know
my
mother
's
nature
.
She
was
always
ready
to
forgive
if
asked
to
*NL*
do
so
;
but
I
seemed
to
her
to
be
as
an
obstinate
child
,
and
that
made
*NL*
her
unyielding
.
Yet
not
unyielding
:
she
was
proud
and
reserved
,
no
*NL*
more
...
Yes
,
I
can
understand
why
she
held
out
against
me
so
long
.
*NL*
She
was
waiting
for
me
.
I
dare
say
she
said
a
hundred
times
in
her
*NL*
sorrow
,
`
What
a
return
he
makes
for
all
the
sacrifices
I
have
made
*NL*
for
him
!
'
I
never
went
to
her
!
When
I
set
out
to
visit
her
it
was
too
*NL*
late
.
To
think
of
that
is
nearly
intolerable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
his
condition
had
been
one
of
utter
remorse
,
unsoftened
by
*NL*
a
single
tear
of
pure
sorrow
:
and
then
he
writhed
as
he
lay
,
fevered
*NL*
far
more
by
thought
than
by
physical
ills
.
``
If
I
could
only
get
one
*NL*
assurance
that
she
did
not
die
in
a
belief
that
I
was
resentful
,
''
he
*NL*
said
one
day
when
in
this
mood
,
``
it
would
be
better
to
think
of
than
*NL*
a
hope
of
heaven
.
But
that
I
can
not
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
give
yourself
up
too
much
to
this
wearying
despair

''
said
*NL*
Eustacia
.
``
Other
men
's
mothers
have
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
does
n't
make
the
loss
of
mine
less
.
Yet
it
is
less
the
loss
*NL*
than
the
circumstances
of
the
loss
.
I
sinned
against
her
,
and
on
that
*NL*
account
there
is
no
light
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
sinned
against
you
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
did
not
.
I
committed
the
guilt
;
and
may
the
whole
burden
be
*NL*
upon
my
head
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
might
consider
twice
before
you
say
that
,
''
Eustacia
*NL*
replied
.
``
Single
men
have
,
no
doubt
,
a
right
to
curse
themselves
as
*NL*
much
as
they
please
;
but
men
with
wives
involve
two
in
the
doom
they
*NL*
pray
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
too
sorry
a
state
to
understand
what
you
are
refining
on
,
''
*NL*
said
the
wretched
man
.
``
Day
and
night
shout
at
me
,
`
You
have
helped
*NL*
to
kill
her
.
'
But
in
loathing
myself
I
may
,
I
own
,
be
unjust
to
you
,
*NL*
my
poor
wife
.
Forgive
me
for
it
,
Eustacia
,
for
I
scarcely
know
what
*NL*
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
was
always
anxious
to
avoid
the
sight
of
her
husband
in
such
*NL*
a
state
as
this
,
which
had
become
as
dreadful
to
her
as
the
trial
*NL*
scene
was
to
Judas
Iscariot
.
It
brought
before
her
eyes
the
spectre
*NL*
of
a
worn-out
woman
knocking
at
a
door
which
she
would
not
open
;
and
*NL*
she
shrank
from
contemplating
it
.
Yet
it
was
better
for
Yeobright
*NL*
himself
when
he
spoke
openly
of
his
sharp
regret
,
for
in
silence
he
*NL*
endured
infinitely
more
,
and
would
sometimes
remain
so
long
in
a
*NL*
tense
,
brooding
mood
,
consuming
himself
by
the
gnawing
of
his
thought
,
*NL*
that
it
was
imperatively
necessary
to
make
him
talk
aloud
,
that
his
*NL*
grief
might
in
some
degree
expend
itself
in
the
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
had
not
been
long
indoors
after
her
look
at
the
moonlight
*NL*
when
a
soft
footstep
came
up
to
the
house
,
and
Thomasin
was
announced
*NL*
by
the
woman
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Thomasin
!
Thank
you
for
coming
tonight
,
''
said
Clym
when
she
*NL*
entered
the
room
.
``
Here
am
I
,
you
see
.
Such
a
wretched
spectacle
am
*NL*
I
,
that
I
shrink
from
being
seen
by
a
single
friend
,
and
almost
from
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
shrink
from
me
,
dear
Clym
,
''
said
Thomasin
earnestly
,
in
*NL*
that
sweet
voice
of
hers
which
came
to
a
sufferer
like
fresh
air
into
*NL*
a
Black
Hole
.
``
Nothing
in
you
can
ever
shock
me
or
drive
me
away
.
I
*NL*
have
been
here
before
,
but
you
do
n't
remember
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
;
I
am
not
delirious
,
Thomasin
,
nor
have
I
been
so
at
all
.
*NL*
Do
n't
you
believe
that
if
they
say
so
.
I
am
only
in
great
misery
at
*NL*
what
I
have
done
:
and
that
,
with
the
weakness
,
makes
me
seem
mad
.
But
*NL*
it
has
not
upset
my
reason
.
Do
you
think
I
should
remember
all
about
*NL*
my
mother
's
death
if
I
were
out
of
my
mind
?
No
such
good
luck
.
Two
*NL*
months
and
a
half
,
Thomasin
,
the
last
of
her
life
,
did
my
poor
mother
*NL*
live
alone
,
distracted
and
mourning
because
of
me
;
yet
she
was
*NL*
unvisited
by
me
,
though
I
was
living
only
six
miles
off
.
Two
months
*NL*
and
a
half
--
seventy-five
days
did
the
sun
rise
and
set
upon
her
in
*NL*
that
deserted
state
which
a
dog
did
n't
deserve
!
Poor
people
who
had
*NL*
nothing
in
common
with
her
would
have
cared
for
her
,
and
visited
her
*NL*
had
they
known
her
sickness
and
loneliness
;
but
I
,
who
should
have
*NL*
been
all
to
her
,
stayed
away
like
a
cur
.
If
there
is
any
justice
in
*NL*
God
let
Him
kill
me
now
.
He

implored
Thomasin

*NL*
affrighted
into
sobs

tears
;
while
Eustacia
,
at
the

side
of

the
room
,
though
her
pale
face
remained
calm

writhed
in

chair

Clym
went
on

heeding

*NL*

The
pallid
Eustacia
said
nothing

If

I

*NL*
``
You

more

said
Eustacia
faintly
*NL*
from
the
other
part
of
the
room

for
the
scene
was
growing
intolerable

to
her

*NL*
``

soothingly

``
Consider
what

you

When
she
said
that
to
the
little

you

taken
her
into

it

It
was
rather
like

in
haste

She
sometimes
used
to
speak
so
to
me

Though
she
did
*NL*
not
come
I
am
convinced
that
she
thought

coming

*NL*
you
suppose
a

could
live
two

three

forgave

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
they
soon
after
heard
the
noise

Wildeve

waiting
outside

went
down

Wildeve
had
alighted

was
standing
before
the

horse

head
when
Eustacia
opened
the
door

He
did
not
turn
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
thinking
the
comer
Thomasin
.
Then
he
looked
,
started
ever
*NL*
so
little
,
and
said
one
word
:
``
Well
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
yet
told

she
replied
in
a
whisper

*NL*
``
Then

bursting
into

*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor

said
Wildeve

visibly
affected
at
her
distress
,
and
at
*NL*
last
led
on
so
far
as
to
take
her
hand

*NL*
``
But

hour
*NL*
after
hour
,
and
hear
him
reproach
himself
as
being
the
cause
of
her
*NL*
death
,
and
to
know
that
I
am
the
sinner
,
if
any
human
being
is
at
all

*NL*
drives
me
into
cold
despair

I
do

know
what
to

Should
I
tell

him
or
should
I
not

I
always

myself
that

want

tell
him

yet
I
am
afraid

he
find

surely
kill

be
in

him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

is
better

when
you

only
tell
part

for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
part
should
I
keep
back

*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
paused
.
``
That

was
in

he
said
in
a
*NL*
low
tone

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

it
must
be
concealed

*NL*

``
If

Wildeve
murmured

*NL*

I
hated
him

Now
I
am
going
up
to
him
again

bade
me
tell
you

would
be
down
in
a
few
minutes

Good-bye

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
,
and
Thomasin
soon
appeared
.
When
she
was
seated
in
the
*NL*
gig
with
her
husband
,
and
the
horse
was
turning
to
go
off
,
Wildeve
*NL*
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
bedroom
windows
.
Looking
from
one
of
them
he
*NL*
could
discern
a
pale
,
tragic
face
watching
him
drive
away
.
It
was

Eustacia

In
upon

Darkened
Understanding
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
's
grief
became
mitigated
by
wearing
itself
out
.
His
strength
*NL*
returned
,
and
a
month
after
the
visit
of
Thomasin
he
might
have
been
*NL*
seen
walking
about
the
garden
.
Endurance
and
despair
,
equanimity
and
*NL*
gloom
,
the
tints
of
health
and
the
pallor
of
death
,
mingled
weirdly
*NL*
in
his
face
.
He
was
now
unnaturally
silent
upon
all
of
the
past
that
*NL*
related
to
his
mother
;
and
though
Eustacia
knew
that
he
was
thinking
*NL*
of
it
none
the
less
,
she
was
only
too
glad
to
escape
the
topic
ever
to
*NL*
bring
it
up
anew
.
When
his
mind
had
been
weaker
his
heart
had
led
him
*NL*
to
speak
out
;
but
reason
having
now
somewhat
recovered
itself
he
sank
*NL*
into
taciturnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
when
he
was
thus
standing
in
the
garden
,
abstractedly
*NL*
spudding
up
a
weed
with
his
stick
,
a
bony
figure
turned
the
corner
of
*NL*
the
house
and
came
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christian
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
Clym
.
``
I
am
glad
you
have
found
me
out

*NL*
I
shall
soon
want
you
to
go
to
Blooms-End
and
assist
me
in
putting
*NL*
the
house
in
order

I
suppose
it
is
all
locked
up
as
I
left
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Mister
Clym

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

But
I
was
coming
to
tell

*NL*
of
something
else
which
is
quite
different
from
what
we
have
lately

had
in

I
am
sent
by

rich

call

to
tell

that
Mrs.

is
doing
*NL*
well
of
a
girl
,
which
was
born
punctually
at
one
o'clock
at
noon
,
*NL*
or
a
few
minutes
more
or
less
;
and
't
is
said
that
expecting
of
this
*NL*
increase
is
what
have
kept
'em
there
since
they
came
into
their
*NL*
money

*NL*
*NL*
``

on

``

Yeobright

expressed
disappointment

look
lighted
up

said

*NL*
``
Yes

Yeobright
regarded

with
intense
surprise

``
Why
did

never

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
been
wondering
why
she

have
walked

the
heath

hot
day

did
she

what
she
was
coming
for

thing

Christian

I
am
very
anxious
to
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Mister
Clym

She
did

it
to
me

though
I

she
did
to

one
here

there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you

*NL*
*NL*

There

I
hope
you

him

as
I
have
seen
him
in
strange
places
,
particular
in
dreams

*NL*
One
night
last
summer
he
glared
at
me
like
Famine
and
Sword
,
and
it
*NL*
made
me
feel
so
low
that
I
did
n't
comb
out
my
few
hairs
for
two
days
.
*NL*
He
was
standing
,
as
it
might
be
,
Mister
Yeobright
,
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
path
to
Mistover
,

up

looking
as
pale

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

when
was
that

*NL*
``
Last

*NL*
``
Pooh

Who
's
the
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Diggory
,
the
reddleman

He
called
upon
her
and
sat
with
her
the
*NL*
evening
before
she
set
out
to
see
you
.
I
had
n't
gone
home
from
work
*NL*
when
he
came
up
to
the
gate
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
see
Venn

I
wish
I
had
known

Clym
anxiously
.
*NL*
``
I
wonder
why
he
has
not
come
to
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
went
out

Heath

*NL*
*NL*
``
Christian

said
Clym
,
``

looking

dubiously
round
at
the
declining
light
;
``

*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Christian
then
departed
.
The
morrow
came
,
but
no
Venn
.
In
the
*NL*
evening
Christian
arrived
,
looking
very
weary
.
He
had
been
searching
*NL*
all
day
,
and
had
heard
nothing
of
the
reddleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inquire
as
much
as
you
can
tomorrow
without
neglecting
your
work
,
''
*NL*
said
Yeobright
.
``
Do
n't
come
again
till
you
have
found
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Yeobright
set
out
for
the
old
house
at
Blooms-End
,
which
,
*NL*
with
the
garden
,
was
now
his
own
.
His
severe
illness
had
hindered
all
*NL*
preparations
for
his
removal
thither
;
but
it
had
become
necessary
*NL*
that
he
should
go
and
overlook
its
contents
,
as
administrator
to
his
*NL*
mother
's
little
property
;
for
which
purpose
he
decided
to
pass
the
*NL*
next
night
on
the
premises
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
journeyed
onward
,
not
quickly
or
decisively
,
but
in
the
slow
walk
*NL*
of
one
who
has
been
awakened
from
a
stupefying
sleep
.
It
was
early
*NL*
afternoon
when
he
reached
the
valley
.
The
expression
of
the
place
,
*NL*
the
tone
of
the
hour
,
were
precisely
those
of
many
such
occasions
in
*NL*
days
gone
by
;
and
these
antecedent
similarities
fostered
the
illusion
*NL*
that
she
,
who
was
there
no
longer
,
would
come
out
to
welcome
him
.
*NL*
The
garden
gate
was
locked
and
the
shutters
were
closed
,
just
as
he
*NL*
himself
had
left
them
on
the
evening
after
the
funeral
.
He
unlocked
*NL*
the
gate
,
and
found
that
a
spider
had
already
constructed
a
large
web
,
*NL*
tying
the
door
to
the
lintel
,
on
the
supposition
that
it
was
never
*NL*
to
be
opened
again
.
When
he
had
entered
the
house
and
flung
back
*NL*
the
shutters
he
set
about
his
task
of
overhauling
the
cupboards
and
*NL*
closets
,
burning
papers
,
and
considering
how
best
to
arrange
the
place
*NL*
for
Eustacia
's
reception
,
until
such
time
as
he
might
be
in
a
position
*NL*
to
carry
out
his
long-delayed
scheme
,
should
that
time
ever
arrive
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
surveyed
the
rooms
he
felt
strongly
disinclined
for
the
*NL*
alterations
which
would
have
to
be
made
in
the
time-honoured
*NL*
furnishing
of
his
parents
and
grandparents
,
to
suit
Eustacia
's
modern
*NL*
ideas
.
The
gaunt
oak-cased
clock
,
with
the
picture
of
the
Ascension
*NL*
on
the
door-panel
and
the
Miraculous
Draught
of
Fishes
on
the
base
;
*NL*
his
grandmother
's
corner
cupboard
with
the
glass
door
,
through
which
*NL*
the
spotted
china
was
visible
;
the
dumb-waiter
;
the
wooden
tea-trays
;
*NL*
the
hanging
fountain
with
the
brass
tap
--
whither
would
these
venerable
*NL*
articles
have
to
be
banished
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
noticed
that
the
flowers
in
the
window
had
died
for
want
of
water
,
*NL*
and
he
placed
them
out
upon
the
ledge
,
that
they
might
be
taken
away
.
*NL*
While
thus
engaged
he
heard
footsteps
on
the
gravel
without
,
and
*NL*
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
opened
it
,
and
Venn
was
standing
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
''
said
the
reddleman
.
``
Is
Mrs.
Yeobright
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
looked
upon
the
ground
.
``
Then
you
have
not
seen
Christian
*NL*
or
any
of
the
Egdon
folks
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
have
only
just
returned
after
a
long
stay
away
.
I
called
here
*NL*
the
day
before
I
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
heard
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
is
--
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
!
''
said
Venn
mechanically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
home
now
is
where
I
should
n't
mind
having
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
regarded
him
,
and
then
said
,
``
If
I
did
n't
see
your
face
I
could
*NL*
never
believe
your
words
.
Have
you
been
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
an
illness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
change
!
When
I
parted
from
her
a
month
ago
everything
*NL*
seemed
to
say
that
she
was
going
to
begin
a
new
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
seemed
came
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
right
,
no
doubt
.
Trouble
has
taught
you
a
deeper
vein
of
*NL*
talk
than
mine
.
All
I
meant
was
regarding
her
life
here
.
She
has
*NL*
died
too
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
through
my
living
too
long
.
I
have
had
a
bitter
experience
*NL*
on
that
score
this
last
month
,
Diggory
.
But
come
in
;
I
have
been
*NL*
wanting
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
conducted
the
reddleman
into
the
large
room
where
the
dancing
had
*NL*
taken
place
the
previous
Christmas
;
and
they
sat
down
in
the
settle
*NL*
together
.
``
There
's
the
cold
fireplace
,
you
see
,
''
said
Clym
.
``
When
*NL*
that
half-burnt
log
and
those
cinders
were
alight
she
was
alive
!
*NL*
Little
has
been
changed
here
yet
.
I
can
do
nothing
.
My
life
creeps
*NL*
like
a
snail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
came
she
to
die
?
''
said
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
gave
him
some
particulars
of
her
illness
and
death
,
and
*NL*
continued
:
``
After
this
no
kind
of
pain
will
ever
seem
more
than
*NL*
an
indisposition
to
me
.
--
I
began
saying
that
I
wanted
to
ask
you
*NL*
something
,
but
I
stray
from
subjects
like
a
drunken
man
.
I
am
anxious
*NL*
to
know
what
my
mother
said
to
you
when
she
last
saw
you
.
You
talked
*NL*
with
her
a
long
time
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
talked
with
her
more
than
half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
And
it
must
have
been
on
account
of
what
we
said
that
she
was
*NL*
on
the
heath
.
Without
question
she
was
coming
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
she
come
to
see
me
if
she
felt
so
bitterly
against
*NL*
me
?
There
's
the
mystery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
know
she
quite
forgave
`
ee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Diggory
--
would
a
woman
,
who
had
quite
forgiven
her
son
,
say
,
*NL*
when
she
felt
herself
ill
on
the
way
to
his
house
,
that
she
was
*NL*
broken-hearted
because
of
his
ill-usage
?
Never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
know
is
that
she
did
n't
blame
you
at
all
.
She
blamed
herself
*NL*
for
what
had
happened
,
only
herself
.
I
had
it
from
her
own
lips
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
it
from
her
lips
that
I
had
NOT
ill-treated
her
;
and
at
the
*NL*
same
time
another
had
it
from
her
lips
that
I
HAD
ill-treated
her
?
*NL*
My
mother
was
no
impulsive
woman
who
changed
her
opinion
every
hour
*NL*
without
reason
.
How
can
it
be
,
Venn
,
that
she
should
have
told
such
*NL*
different
stories
in
close
succession
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
say
.
It
is
certainly
odd
,
when
she
had
forgiven
you
,
and
*NL*
had
forgiven
your
wife
,
and
was
going
to
see
ye
on
purpose
to
make
*NL*
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
was
one
thing
wanting
to
bewilder
me
it
was
this
*NL*
incomprehensible
thing
!
...
Diggory
,
if
we
,
who
remain
alive
,
were
only
*NL*
allowed
to
hold
conversation
with
the
dead
--
just
once
,
a
bare
minute
,
*NL*
even
through
a
screen
of
iron
bars
,
as
with
persons
in
prison
--
what
we
*NL*
might
learn
!
How
many
who
now
ride
smiling
would
hide
their
heads
!
And
*NL*
this
mystery
--
I
should
then
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
at
once
.
But
the
*NL*
grave
has
for
ever
shut
her
in
;
and
how
shall
it
be
found
out
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
reply
was
returned
by
his
companion
,
since
none
could
be
given
;
and
*NL*
when
Venn
left
,
a
few
minutes
later
,
Clym
had
passed
from
the
dullness
*NL*
of
sorrow
to
the
fluctuation
of
carking
incertitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
in
the
same
state
all
the
afternoon
.
A
bed
was
made
up
*NL*
for
him
in
the
same
house
by
a
neighbour
,
that
he
might
not
have
to
*NL*
return
again
the
next
day
;
and
when
he
retired
to
rest
in
the
deserted
*NL*
place
it
was
only
to
remain
awake
hour
after
hour
thinking
the
same
*NL*
thoughts
.
How
to
discover
a
solution
to
this
riddle
of
death
seemed
a
*NL*
query
of
more
importance
than
highest
problems
of
the
living
.
There
*NL*
was
housed
in
his
memory
a
vivid
picture
of
the
face
of
a
little
boy
*NL*
as
he
entered
the
hovel
where
Clym
's
mother
lay
.
The
round
eyes
,
*NL*
eager
gaze
,
the
piping
voice
which
enunciated
the
words
,
had
operated
*NL*
like
stilettos
on
his
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
visit
to
the
boy
suggested
itself
as
a
means
of
gleaning
new
*NL*
particulars
;
though
it
might
be
quite
unproductive
.
To
probe
a
*NL*
child
's
mind
after
the
lapse
of
six
weeks
,
not
for
facts
which
the
*NL*
child
had
seen
and
understood
,
but
to
get
at
those
which
were
in
*NL*
their
nature
beyond
him
,
did
not
promise
much
;
yet
when
every
obvious
*NL*
channel
is
blocked
we
grope
towards
the
small
and
obscure
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
else
left
to
do
;
after
that
he
would
allow
the
enigma
to
drop
*NL*
into
the
abyss
of
undiscoverable
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
daybreak
when
he
had
reached
this
decision
,
and
he
*NL*
at
once
arose
.
He
locked
up
the
house
and
went
out
into
the
green
*NL*
patch
which
merged
in
heather
further
on
.
In
front
of
the
white
*NL*
garden-palings
the
path
branched
into
three
like
a
broad-arrow
.
The
*NL*
road
to
the
right
led
to
the
Quiet
Woman
and
its
neighbourhood
;
the
*NL*
middle
track
led
to
Mistover
Knap
;
the
left-hand
track
led
over
*NL*
the
hill
to
another
part
of
Mistover
,
where
the
child
lived
.
On
*NL*
inclining
into
the
latter
path
Yeobright
felt
a
creeping
chilliness
,
*NL*
familiar
enough
to
most
people
,
and
probably
caused
by
the
unsunned
*NL*
morning
air
.
In
after
days
he
thought
of
it
as
a
thing
of
singular
*NL*
significance
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Yeobright
reached
the
cottage
of
Susan
Nunsuch
,
the
mother
of
the
*NL*
boy
he
sought
,
he
found
that
the
inmates
were
not
yet
astir
.
But
in
*NL*
upland
hamlets
the
transition
from
a-bed
to
abroad
is
surprisingly
*NL*
swift
and
easy
.
There
no
dense
partition
of
yawns
and
toilets
divides
*NL*
humanity
by
night
from
humanity
by
day
.
Yeobright
tapped
at
the
upper
*NL*
window-sill
,
which
he
could
reach
with
his
walking-stick
;
and
in
three
*NL*
or
four
minutes
the
woman
came
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
this
moment
that
Clym
recollected
her
to
be
the
person
*NL*
who
had
behaved
so
barbarously
to
Eustacia
.
It
partly
explained
the
*NL*
insuavity
with
which
the
woman
greeted
him
.
Moreover
,
the
boy
had
*NL*
been
ailing
again
;
and
Susan
now
,
as
ever
since
the
night
when
he
had
*NL*
been
pressed
into
Eustacia
's
service
at
the
bonfire
,
attributed
his
*NL*
indispositions
to
Eustacia
's
influence
as
a
witch
.
It
was
one
of
*NL*
those
sentiments
which
lurk
like
moles
underneath
the
visible
surface
*NL*
of
manners
,
and
may
have
been
kept
alive
by
Eustacia
's
entreaty
to
the
*NL*
captain
,
at
the
time
that
he
had
intended
to
prosecute
Susan
for
the
*NL*
pricking
in
church
,
to
let
the
matter
drop
;
which
he
accordingly
had
*NL*
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
overcame
his
repugnance
,
for
Susan
had
at
least
borne
his
*NL*
mother
no
ill-will
.
He
asked
kindly
for
the
boy
;
but
her
manner
did
*NL*
not
improve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
see
him
,
''
continued
Yeobright
,
with
some
hesitation
;
``
to
*NL*
ask
him
if
he
remembers
anything
more
of
his
walk
with
my
mother
than
*NL*
what
he
has
previously
told
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
regarded
him
in
a
peculiar
and
criticizing
manner
.
To
anybody
but
*NL*
a
half-blind
man
it
would
have
said
,
``
You
want
another
of
the
knocks
*NL*
which
have
already
laid
you
so
low
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
called
the
boy
downstairs
,
asked
Clym
to
sit
down
on
a
stool
,
and
*NL*
continued
,
``
Now
,
Johnny
,
tell
Mr.
Yeobright
anything
you
can
call
to
*NL*
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
forgotten
how
you
walked
with
the
poor
lady
on
that
hot
*NL*
day
?
''
said
Clym
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
she
said
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
repeated
the
exact
words
he
had
used
on
entering
the
hut
.
*NL*
Yeobright
rested
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
shaded
his
face
with
his
*NL*
hand
;
and
the
mother
looked
as
if
she
wondered
how
a
man
could
want
*NL*
more
of
what
had
stung
him
so
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
going
to
Alderworth
when
you
first
met
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
she
was
coming
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
ca
n't
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
she
walked
along
with
me
.
I
was
coming
away
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
where
did
you
first
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
your
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Attend
,
and
speak
the
truth
!
''
said
Clym
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
at
your
house
was
where
I
seed
her
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
started
up
,
and
Susan
smiled
in
an
expectant
way
which
did
not
*NL*
embellish
her
face
;
it
seemed
to
mean
,
``
Something
sinister
is
coming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
she
do
at
my
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
went
and
sat
under
the
trees
at
the
Devil
's
Bellows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
this
is
all
news
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
told
me
this
before
?
''
said
Susan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
mother
;
because
I
did
n't
like
to
tell
`

I
had
been
so
far
.
I
*NL*
was
picking
black-hearts
,
and
went
further
than
I
meant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
she
do
then
?
''
said
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looked
at
a
man
who
came
up
and
went
into
your
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
myself
--
a
furze-cutter
,
with
brambles
in
his
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
't
was
not
you

'T
was
a
gentleman

You
had
gone
in
afore

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
he
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
tell
me
what
happened
next

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
poor
lady
went
and
knocked
at
your
door
,
and
the
lady
with
black
*NL*
hair
looked
out
of
the
side
window
at
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
's
mother
turned
to
Clym
and
said
,
``
This
is
something
you
*NL*
did
n't
expect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
took
no
more
notice
of
her
than
if
he
had
been
of
stone
.
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
go
on
,
''
he
said
hoarsely
to
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
she
saw
the
young
lady
look
out
of
the
window
the
old
lady
*NL*
knocked
again
;
and
when
nobody
came
she
took
up
the
furze-hook
and
*NL*
looked
at
it
,
and
put
it
down
again
,
and
then
she
looked
at
the
*NL*
faggot-bonds
;
and
then
she
went
away
,
and
walked
across
to
me
,
and
*NL*
blowed
her
breath
very
hard
,
like
this
.
We
walked
on
together
,
she
*NL*
and
I
,
and
I
talked
to
her
and
she
talked
to
me
a
bit
,
but
not
much
,
*NL*
because
she
could
n't
blow
her
breath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
''
murmured
Clym
,
in
a
low
tone
,
and
bowed
his
head
.
``
Let
's
have
*NL*
more
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
could
n't
talk
much
,
and
she
could
n't
walk
;
and
her
face
was
,
O
*NL*
so
queer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
her
face
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
yours
is
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
looked
at
Yeobright
,
and
beheld
him
colourless
,
in
a
cold
*NL*
sweat
.
``
Is
n't
there
meaning
in
it
?
''
she
said
stealthily
.
``
What
do
*NL*
you
think
of
her
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
said
Clym
fiercely
.
And
,
turning
to
the
boy
,
``
And
then
you
*NL*
left
her
to
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
woman
,
quickly
and
angrily
.
``
He
did
not
leave
her
to
*NL*
die
!
She
sent
him
away
.
Whoever
says
he
forsook
her
says
what
's
not
*NL*
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trouble
no
more
about
that
,
''
answered
Clym
,
with
a
quivering
mouth
.
*NL*
``
What
he
did
is
a
trifle
in
comparison
with
what
he
saw
.
Door
kept
*NL*
shut
,
did
you
say
?
Kept
shut
,
she
looking
out
of
window
?
Good
heart
*NL*
of
God
!
--
what
does
it
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
shrank
away
from
the
gaze
of
his
questioner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
so
,
''
answered
the
mother
,
``
and
Johnny
's
a
God-fearing
boy
*NL*
and
tells
no
lies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Cast
off
by
my
son
!
'
No
,
by
my
best
life
,
dear
mother
,
it
is
not
so
!
*NL*
But
by
your
son
's
,
your
son
's
--
May
all
murderesses
get
the
torment
*NL*
they
deserve
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
Yeobright
went
forth
from
the
little
dwelling
.
The
*NL*
pupils
of
his
eyes
,
fixed
steadfastly
on
blankness
,
were
vaguely
*NL*
lit
with
an
icy
shine
;
his
mouth
had
passed
into
the
phase
more
or
*NL*
less
imaginatively
rendered
in
studies
of
Oedipus
.
The
strangest
*NL*
deeds
were
possible
to
his
mood
.
But
they
were
not
possible
to
*NL*
his
situation
.
Instead
of
there
being
before
him
the
pale
face
*NL*
of
Eustacia
,
and
a
masculine
shape
unknown
,
there
was
only
the
*NL*
imperturbable
countenance
of
the
heath
,
which
,
having
defied
the
*NL*
cataclysmal
onsets
of
centuries
,
reduced
to
insignificance
by
its
*NL*
seamed
and
antique
features
the
wildest
turmoil
of
a
single
man
.

Dresses
Herself
on
a
Black
Morning
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
consciousness
of
a
vast
impassivity
in
all
which
lay
around
him
took
*NL*
possession
even
of
Yeobright
in
his
wild
walk
towards
Alderworth
.
He
*NL*
had
once
before
felt
in
his
own
person
this
overpowering
of
the
fervid
*NL*
by
the
inanimate
;
but
then
it
had
tended
to
enervate
a
passion
far
*NL*
sweeter
than
that
which
at
present
pervaded
him
.
It
was
once
when
he
*NL*
stood
parting
from
Eustacia
in
the
moist
still
levels
beyond
the
*NL*
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
dismissing
all
this
he
went
onward
home
,
and
came
to
the
front
of
*NL*
his
house
.
The
blinds
of
Eustacia
's
bedroom
were
still
closely
drawn
,
*NL*
for
she
was
no
early
riser
.
All
the
life
visible
was
in
the
shape
of
*NL*
a
solitary
thrush
cracking
a
small
snail
upon
the
door-stone
for
his
*NL*
breakfast
,
and
his
tapping
seemed
a
loud
noise
in
the
general
silence
*NL*
which
prevailed
;
but
on
going
to
the
door
Clym
found
it
unfastened
,
*NL*
the
young
girl
who
attended
upon
Eustacia
being
astir
in
the
back
part
*NL*
of
the
premises
.
Yeobright
entered
and
went
straight
to
his
wife
's
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
of
his
arrival
must
have
aroused
her
,
for
when
he
opened
the
*NL*
door
she
was
standing
before
the
looking-glass
in
her
night-dress
,
the
*NL*
ends
of
her
hair
gathered
into
one
hand
,
with
which
she
was
coiling
*NL*
the
whole
mass
round
her
head
,
previous
to
beginning
toilette
*NL*
operations
.
She
was
not
a
woman
given
to
speaking
first
at
a
meeting
,
*NL*
and
she
allowed
Clym
to
walk
across
in
silence
,
without
turning
her
*NL*
head
.
He
came
behind
her
,
and
she
saw
his
face
in
the
glass
.
It
was
*NL*
ashy
,
haggard
,
and
terrible
.
Instead
of
starting
towards
him
in
*NL*
sorrowful
surprise
,
as
even
Eustacia
,
undemonstrative
wife
as
she
was
,
*NL*
would
have
done
in
days
before
she
burdened
herself
with
a
secret
,
*NL*
she
remained
motionless
,
looking
at
him
in
the
glass
.
And
while
*NL*
she
looked
the
carmine
flush
with
which
warmth
and
sound
sleep
had
*NL*
suffused
her
cheeks
and
neck
dissolved
from
view
,
and
the
deathlike
*NL*
pallor
in
his
face
flew
across
into
hers
.
He
was
close
enough
to
see
*NL*
this
,
and
the
sight
instigated
his
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
is
the
matter
,
''
he
said
huskily
.
``
I
see
it
in
your
*NL*
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
hand
relinquished
the
rope
of
hair
and
dropped
to
her
side
,
and
*NL*
the
pile
of
tresses
,
no
longer
supported
,
fell
from
the
crown
of
her
*NL*
head
about
her
shoulders
and
over
the
white
night-gown
.
She
made
no
*NL*
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
to
me
,
''
said
Yeobright
peremptorily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blanching
process
did
not
cease
in
her
,
and
her
lips
now
became
as
*NL*
white
as
her
face
.
She
turned
to
him
and
said
,
``
Yes
,
Clym
,
I
'll
speak
*NL*
to
you
.
Why
do
you
return
so
early
?
Can
I
do
anything
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
can
listen
to
me
.
It
seems
that
my
wife
is
not
very
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
face
,
my
dear
;
your
face
.
Or
perhaps
it
is
the
pale
morning
*NL*
light
which
takes
your
colour
away
?
Now
I
am
going
to
reveal
a
secret
*NL*
to
you
.
Ha-ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
that
is
ghastly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
laugh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
reason
for
ghastliness
.
Eustacia
,
you
have
held
my
happiness
*NL*
in
the
hollow
of
your
hand
,
and
like
a
devil
you
have
dashed
it
down
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
back
from
the
dressing-table
,
retreated
a
few
steps
from
*NL*
him
,
and
looked
him
in
the
face
.
``
Ah
!
you
think
to
frighten
me
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
with
a
slight
laugh
.
``
Is
it
worth
while
?
I
am
undefended
,
and
*NL*
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
extraordinary
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
there
is
ample
time
I
will
tell
you
,
though
you
know
well
enough
.
*NL*
I
mean
that
it
is
extraordinary
that
you
should
be
alone
in
my
*NL*
absence
.
Tell
me
,
now
,
where
is
he
who
was
with
you
on
the
afternoon
*NL*
of
the
thirty-first
of
August
?
Under
the
bed
?
Up
the
chimney
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
shudder
overcame
her
and
shook
the
light
fabric
of
her
night-dress
*NL*
throughout
.
``
I
do
not
remember
dates
so
exactly
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
*NL*
can
not
recollect
that
anybody
was
with
me
besides
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
I
mean
,
''
said
Yeobright
,
his
voice
growing
louder
and
*NL*
harsher
,
``
was
the
day
you
shut
the
door
against
my
mother
and
killed
*NL*
her
.
O
,
it
is
too
much
--
too
bad
!
''
He
leant
over
the
footpiece
of
the
*NL*
bedstead
for
a
few
moments
,
with
his
back
towards
her
;
then
rising
*NL*
again
:
``
Tell
me
,
tell
me
!
tell
me
--
do
you
hear
?
''
he
cried
,
rushing
up
*NL*
to
her
and
seizing
her
by
the
loose
folds
of
her
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
superstratum
of
timidity
which
often
overlies
those
who
are
daring
*NL*
and
defiant
at
heart
had
been
passed
through
,
and
the
mettlesome
*NL*
substance
of
the
woman
was
reached
.
The
red
blood
inundated
her
face
,
*NL*
previously
so
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
''
she
said
in
a
low
voice
,
regarding
him
*NL*
with
a
proud
smile
.
``
You
will
not
alarm
me
by
holding
on
so
;
but
it
*NL*
would
be
a
pity
to
tear
my
sleeve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
letting
go
he
drew
her
closer
to
him
.
``
Tell
me
the
*NL*
particulars
of
--
my
mother
's
death
,
''
he
said
in
a
hard
,
panting
*NL*
whisper
;
``
or
--
I
'll
--
I
'll
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clym
,
''
she
answered
slowly
,
``
do
you
think
you
dare
do
anything
to
*NL*
me
that
I
dare
not
bear
?
But
before
you
strike
me
listen
.
You
will
*NL*
get
nothing
from
me
by
a
blow
,

all

sudden
change

making

His

had
fallen
upon
a
small
desk
*NL*
that
stood
near
,
on
which
she
was
accustomed
to
write
her
letters

*NL*
He
went
to

locked

You

Without
another

he
seized
the
desk
and
dashed
it
to
the
floor
.
*NL*
The
hinge
burst
open
,
and
a
number
of
letters
tumbled
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
!
''
said
Eustacia
,
stepping
before
him
with
more
excitement
than
*NL*
she
had
hitherto
shown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come

stand
away

I

see
them

*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
the
letters
as
they
lay
,
checked
her
feeling
,
and
moved
*NL*
indifferently
aside
;
when
he
gathered
them
up
,
and
examined
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
no
stretch
of
meaning
could
any
but
a
harmless
construction
be
*NL*
placed
upon
a
single
one
of
the
letters
themselves

The
solitary
*NL*
exception
was
an
empty
envelope
directed
to
her
,
and
the
handwriting
*NL*
was
Wildeve
's
.
Yeobright
held
it
up

Eustacia
was
doggedly
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
read

Look
at

Doubtless
we
shall
find

more
soon

what
was
inside
them

I
shall
no

be
gratified
by

learning

a
well-finished

full-blown

*NL*
``

He
searched
further

found
nothing
more

What
was

said

*NL*

Call
her
to

think
of
her

what
goodness
there
was
in

it

showed
in
every
line
of
her
face
!
Most
women
,
even
when

slightly
*NL*
annoyed
,
show
a
flicker
of
evil
in
some
curl
of
the
mouth
or
some
*NL*
corner
of
the
cheek
;
but
as
for
her
,
never
in
her
angriest
moments
was
*NL*
there
anything
malicious
in
her
look
.
She
was
angered
quickly
,
but
*NL*
she
forgave
just
as
readily
,
and
underneath
her
pride
there
was
the
*NL*
meekness
of
a
child

What
came
of
it

what
cared
you

You
hated
her
*NL*
just
as

you
see
what
was

best
for

must
bring
a
curse
upon
me

agony

death
*NL*
upon
her

by
doing
that
cruel
deed

What
was
the
fellow

name
who
*NL*
was
keeping
you
company
and
causing
you
to
add
cruelty
to
her
to
your
*NL*
wrong
to
me
?
Was
it
Wildeve
?
Was
it
poor
Thomasin
's
husband

Heaven
,
*NL*
what
wickedness
!
Lost
your
voice
,
have
you
?
It
is
natural
after
*NL*
detection
of
that
most
noble
trick

Eustacia
,
did
n't
any
tender
*NL*
thought
of
your
own
mother
lead
you
to
think
of
being
gentle
to
mine
*NL*
at
such
a
time
of
weariness

Did
not
one
grain
of

enter
your

she
turned
away

Think
what
a
vast
opportunity
was
then
lost

beginning
a
forgiving

honest
course

Why
did
not
you
kick
him
*NL*
out
,

let
her
in
,
and
say
I
'll
be
an
honest

a
noble

*NL*
from
this
hour

Had
I
told
you
to
go

quench
eternally
our
last
*NL*
flickering
chance
of
happiness
here
you
could
have
done
no

asleep
now

you
a

gallants

you
can
insult
her
any
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
exaggerate
fearfully

she
said
in
a
faint

weary
voice
;
``

I
*NL*

not
enter

been
scared
*NL*
away
from
me

I
sank
into
the
mire
of

this
your

cherishing

to
put
me
into
a
hut
like
this

and
keep
me
like
the
wife
*NL*
of
a

You
deceived
me

not
by
words

by
appearances

are
less
seen

any

words

smothered
in

her
head
drooped
down

hastily
dressed
herself

Yeobright
moodily
walking
up

down

the
room
the

At

all
her
things

on

Her

little
hands
quivered
so
violently

she
held
them
to
her
chin
to
*NL*
fasten
her
bonnet
that
she
could
not
tie
the
strings

after
a
few

moments
she
relinquished

forward

assented

her

was
totally

he
was
not

turned

aside

turned

She
flung

The
Ministrations
of
a
Half-forgotten
One

*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
's
journey
was
at
first
as
vague
in
direction
as
that
of
*NL*
thistledown
on
the
wind
.
She
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
She
wished
it
*NL*
had
been
night
instead
of
morning
,
that
she
might
at
least
have
borne
*NL*
her
misery
without
the
possibility
of
being
seen
.
Tracing
mile
after
*NL*
mile
along
between
the
dying
ferns
and
the
wet
white
spiders
'
webs
,
*NL*
she
at
length
turned
her
steps
towards
her
grandfather
's
house
.
She
*NL*
found
the
front
door
closed
and
locked
.
Mechanically
she
went
round
*NL*
to
the
end
where
the
stable
was
,
and
on
looking
in
at
the
stable-door
*NL*
she
saw
Charley
standing
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Vye
is
not
at
home
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
,
''
said
the
lad
in
a
flutter
of
feeling
;
``
he
's
gone
to
*NL*
Weatherbury
,
and
wo
n't
be
home
till
night
.
And
the
servant
is
gone
*NL*
home
for
a
holiday
.
So
the
house
is
locked
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
's
face
was
not
visible
to
Charley
as
she
stood
at
the
*NL*
doorway
,
her
back
being
to
the
sky
,
and
the
stable
but
indifferently
*NL*
lighted
;
but
the
wildness
of
her
manner
arrested
his
attention
.
She
*NL*
turned
and
walked
away
across
the
enclosure
to
the
gate
,
and
was
*NL*
hidden
by
the
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
disappeared
Charley
,
with
misgiving
in
his
eyes
,
slowly
*NL*
came
from
the
stable
door
,
and
going
to
another
point
in
the
bank
he
*NL*
looked
over
.
Eustacia
was
leaning
against
it
on
the
outside
,
her
face
*NL*
covered
with
her
hands
,
and
her
head
pressing
the
dewy
heather
which
*NL*
bearded
the
bank
's
outer
side
.
She
appeared
to
be
utterly
indifferent
*NL*
to
the
circumstance
that
her
bonnet
,
hair
,
and
garments
were
becoming
*NL*
wet
and
disarranged
by
the
moisture
of
her
cold
,
harsh
pillow
.
*NL*
Clearly
something
was
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
had
always
regarded
Eustacia
as
Eustacia
had
regarded
Clym
*NL*
when
she
first
beheld
him
--
as
a
romantic
and
sweet
vision
,
scarcely
*NL*
incarnate
.
He
had
been
so
shut
off
from
her
by
the
dignity
of
her
*NL*
look
and
the
pride
of
her
speech
,
except
at
that
one
blissful
interval
*NL*
when
he
was
allowed
to
hold
her
hand
,
that
he
had
hardly
deemed
her
*NL*
a
woman
,
wingless
and
earthly
,
subject
to
household
conditions
and
*NL*
domestic
jars
.
The
inner
details
of
her
life
he
had
only
conjectured
.
*NL*
She
had
been
a
lovely
wonder
,
predestined
to
an
orbit
in
which
the
*NL*
whole
of
his
own
was
but
a
point
;
and
this
sight
of
her
leaning
like
a
*NL*
helpless
,
despairing
creature
against
a
wild
wet
bank
filled
him
with
*NL*
an
amazed
horror
.
He
could
no
longer
remain
where
he
was
.
Leaping
*NL*
over
,
he
came
up
,
touched
her
with
his
finger
,
and
said
tenderly
,
``
You
*NL*
are
poorly
,
ma'am
.
What
can
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
started
up
,
and
said
,
``
Ah
,
Charley
--
you
have
followed
me
.
*NL*
You
did
not
think
when
I
left
home
in
the
summer
that
I
should
come
*NL*
back
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
,
dear
ma'am
.
Can
I
help
you
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
not
.
I
wish
I
could
get
into
the
house
.
I
feel
*NL*
giddy
--
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lean
on
my
arm
,
ma'am
,
till
we
get
to
the
porch
,
and
I
will
try
to
*NL*
open
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
supported
her
to
the
porch
,
and
there
depositing
her
on
a
seat
*NL*
hastened
to
the
back
,
climbed
to
a
window
by
the
help
of
a
ladder
,
*NL*
and
descending
inside
opened
the
door
.
Next
he
assisted
her
into
the
*NL*
room
,
where
there
was
an
old-fashioned
horsehair
settee
as
large
as
a
*NL*
donkey-waggon
.
She
lay
down
here
,
and
Charley
covered
her
with
a
cloak
*NL*
he
found
in
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
get
you
something
to
eat
and
drink
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
Charley
.
But
I
suppose
there
is
no
fire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
light
it
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
vanished
,
and
she
heard
a
splitting
of
wood
and
a
blowing
of
*NL*
bellows
;
and
presently
he
returned
,
saying
,
``
I
have
lighted
a
fire
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
,
and
now
I
'll
light
one
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lit
the
fire
,
Eustacia
dreamily
observing
him
from
her
couch
.
When
*NL*
it
was
blazing
up
he
said
,
``
Shall
I
wheel
you
round
in
front
of
it
,
*NL*
ma'am
,
as
the
morning
is
chilly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
go
and
bring
the
victuals
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
do
,
''
she
murmured
languidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
gone
,
and
the
dull
sounds
occasionally
reached
her
ears
*NL*
of
his
movements
in
the
kitchen
,
she
forgot
where
she
was
,
and
had
*NL*
for
a
moment
to
consider
by
an
effort
what
the
sounds
meant
.
After
an
*NL*
interval
which
seemed
short
to
her
whose
thoughts
were
elsewhere
,
he
*NL*
came
in
with
a
tray
on
which
steamed
tea
and
toast
,
though
it
was
*NL*
nearly
lunch-time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Place
it
on
the
table
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
shall
be
ready
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
so
,
and
retired
to
the
door
;
when
,
however
,
he
perceived
that
*NL*
she
did
not
move
he
came
back
a
few
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
hold
it
to
you
,
if
you
do
n't
wish
to
get
up
,
''
said
Charley
.
*NL*
He
brought
the
tray
to
the
front
of
the
couch
,
where
he
knelt
down
,
*NL*
adding
,
``
I
will
hold
it
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
sat
up
and
poured
out
a
cup
of
tea
.
``
You
are
very
kind
to
*NL*
me
,
Charley
,
''
she
murmured
as
she
sipped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
ought
to
be
,
''
said
he
diffidently
,
taking
great
trouble
*NL*
not
to
rest
his
eyes
upon
her
,
though
this
was
their
only
natural
*NL*
position
,
Eustacia
being
immediately
before
him
.
``
You
have
been
kind
*NL*
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
have
I
?
''
said
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
let
me
hold
your
hand
when
you
were
a
maiden
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
so
I
did
.
Why
did
I
do
that
?
My
mind
is
lost
--
it
had
to
do
with
*NL*
the
mumming
,
had
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
wanted
to
go
in
my
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
.
I
do
indeed
remember
--
too
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
again
became
utterly
downcast
;
and
Charley
,
seeing
that
she
was
*NL*
not
going
to
eat
or
drink
any
more
,
took
away
the
tray
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afterwards
he
occasionally
came
in
to
see
if
the
fire
was
burning
,
to
*NL*
ask
her
if
she
wanted
anything
,
to
tell
her
that
the
wind
had
shifted
*NL*
from
south
to
west
,
to
ask
her
if
she
would
like
him
to
gather
her
*NL*
some
blackberries
;
to
all
which
inquiries
she
replied
in
the
negative
*NL*
or
with
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
on
the
settee
some
time
longer
,
when
she
aroused
herself
*NL*
and
went
upstairs
.
The
room
in
which
she
had
formerly
slept
still
*NL*
remained
much
as
she
had
left
it
,
and
the
recollection
that
this
*NL*
forced
upon
her
of
her
own
greatly
changed
and
infinitely
worsened
*NL*
situation
again
set
on
her
face
the
undetermined
and
formless
*NL*
misery
which
it
had
worn
on
her
first
arrival
.
She
peeped
into
her
*NL*
grandfather
's
room
,
through
which
the
fresh
autumn
air
was
blowing
*NL*
from
the
open
window
.
Her
eye
was
arrested
by
what
was
a
familiar
*NL*
sight
enough
,
though
it
broke
upon
her
now
with
a
new
significance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
brace
of
pistols
,
hanging
near
the
head
of
her
grandfather
's
*NL*
bed
,
which
he
always
kept
there
loaded
,
as
a
precaution
against
*NL*
possible
burglars
,
the
house
being
very
lonely
.
Eustacia
regarded
*NL*
them
long
,
as
if
they
were
the
page
of
a
book
in
which
she
read
a
*NL*
new
and
a
strange
matter
.
Quickly
,
like
one
afraid
of
herself
,
she
*NL*
returned
downstairs
and
stood
in
deep
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
only
do
it
!
''
she
said
.
``
It
would
be
doing
much
good
to
*NL*
myself
and
all
connected
with
me
,
and
no
harm
to
a
single
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
seemed
to
gather
force
within
her
,
and
she
remained
in
*NL*
a
fixed
attitude
nearly
ten
minutes
,
when
a
certain
finality
was
*NL*
expressed
in
her
gaze
,
and
no
longer
the
blankness
of
indecision
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
and
went
up
the
second
time
--
softly
and
stealthily
now
--
and
*NL*
entered
her
grandfather
's
room
,
her
eyes
at
once
seeking
the
head
of
*NL*
the
bed
.
The
pistols
were
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
quashing
of
her
purpose
by
their
absence
affected
her
*NL*
brain
as
a
sudden
vacuum
affects
the
body
:
she
nearly
fainted
.
Who
*NL*
had
done
this
?
There
was
only
one
person
on
the
premises
besides
*NL*
herself
.
Eustacia
involuntarily
turned
to
the
open
window
which
*NL*
overlooked
the
garden
as
far
as
the
bank
that
bounded
it
.
On
the
*NL*
summit
of
the
latter
stood
Charley
,
sufficiently
elevated
by
its
*NL*
height
to
see
into
the
room
.
His
gaze
was
directed
eagerly
and
*NL*
solicitously
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
downstairs
to
the
door
and
beckoned
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
taken
them
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
looking
at
them
too
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
that
to
do
with
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
heart-broken
all
the
morning
,
as
if
you
did
not
want
*NL*
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
could
not
bear
to
leave
them
in
your
way
.
There
was
meaning
*NL*
in
your
look
at
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
they
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Locked
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
stable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
them
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
refuse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
.
I
care
too
much
for
you
to
give
'em
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
aside
,
her
face
for
the
first
time
softening
from
the
stony
*NL*
immobility
of
the
earlier
day
,
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
resuming
*NL*
something
of
that
delicacy
of
cut
which
was
always
lost
in
her
moments
*NL*
of
despair
.
At
last
she
confronted
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
not
die
if
I
wish
?
''
she
said
tremulously
.
``
I
have
made
*NL*
a
bad
bargain
with
life
,
and
I
am
weary
of
it
--
weary
.
And
now
you
have
*NL*
hindered
my
escape
.
O
,
why
did
you
,
Charley
!
What
makes
death
painful
*NL*
except
the
thought
of
others
'
grief
?
--
and
that
is
absent
in
my
case
,
*NL*
for
not
a
sigh
would
follow
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
is
trouble
that
has
done
this
!
I
wish
in
my
very
soul
that
he
*NL*
who
brought
it
about
might
die
and
rot
,
even
if
't
is
transportation
to
*NL*
say
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charley
,
no
more
of
that
.
What
do
you
mean
to
do
about
this
you
have
*NL*
seen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
it
close
as
night
,
if
you
promise
not
to
think
of
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
fear
.
The
moment
has
passed
.
I
promise
.
''
She
then
went
*NL*
away
,
entered
the
house
,
and
lay
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
in
the
afternoon
her
grandfather
returned
.
He
was
about
to
*NL*
question
her
categorically
;
but
on
looking
at
her
he
withheld
his
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
too
bad
to
talk
of
,
''
she
slowly
returned
in
answer
to
his
*NL*
glance
.
``
Can
my
old
room
be
got
ready
for
me
tonight
,
grandfather
?
I
*NL*
shall
want
to
occupy
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
ask
what
it
all
meant
,
or
why
she
had
left
her
husband
,
but
*NL*
ordered
the
room
to
be
prepared
.

An
Old
Move
Inadvertently
Repeated
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
's
attentions
to
his
former
mistress
were
unbounded
.
The
only
*NL*
solace
to
his
own
trouble
lay
in
his
attempts
to
relieve
hers
.
Hour
*NL*
after
hour
he
considered
her
wants
:
he
thought
of
her
presence
there
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
gratitude
,
and
,
while
uttering
imprecations
on
the
*NL*
cause
of
her
unhappiness
,
in
some
measure
blessed
the
result
.
Perhaps
*NL*
she
would
always
remain
there
,
he
thought
,
and
then
he
would
be
as
*NL*
happy
as
he
had
been
before
.
His
dread
was
lest
she
should
think
fit
*NL*
to
return
to
Alderworth
,
and
in
that
dread
his
eyes
,
with
all
the
*NL*
inquisitiveness
of
affection
,
frequently
sought
her
face
when
she
was
*NL*
not
observing
him
,
as
he
would
have
watched
the
head
of
a
stockdove
*NL*
to
learn
if
it
contemplated
flight
.
Having
once
really
succoured
her
,
*NL*
and
possibly
preserved
her
from
the
rashest
of
acts
,
he
mentally
*NL*
assumed
in
addition
a
guardian
's
responsibility
for
her
welfare
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
reason
he
busily
endeavoured
to
provide
her
with
pleasant
*NL*
distractions
,
bringing
home
curious
objects
which
he
found
in
the
*NL*
heath
,
such
as
white
trumpet-shaped
mosses
,
red-headed
lichens
,
stone
*NL*
arrow-heads
used
by
the
old
tribes
on
Egdon
,
and
faceted
crystals
from
*NL*
the
hollows
of
flints
.
These
he
deposited
on
the
premises
in
such
*NL*
positions
that
she
should
see
them
as
if
by
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
passed
,
Eustacia
never
going
out
of
the
house
.
Then
she
walked
*NL*
into
the
enclosed
plot
and
looked
through
her
grandfather
's
spy-glass
,
*NL*
as
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
before
her
marriage
.
One
day
*NL*
she
saw
,
at
a
place
where
the
high-road
crossed
the
distant
valley
,
*NL*
a
heavily
laden
waggon
passing
along
.
It
was
piled
with
household
*NL*
furniture
.
She
looked
again
and
again
,
and
recognized
it
to
be
her
*NL*
own
.
In
the
evening
her
grandfather
came
indoors
with
a
rumour
that
*NL*
Yeobright
had
removed
that
day
from
Alderworth
to
the
old
house
at
*NL*
Blooms-End
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
occasion
when
reconnoitring
thus
she
beheld
two
female
*NL*
figures
walking
in
the
vale
.
The
day
was
fine
and
clear
;
and
the
*NL*
persons
not
being
more
than
half
a
mile
off
she
could
see
their
every
*NL*
detail
with
the
telescope
.
The
woman
walking
in
front
carried
a
white
*NL*
bundle
in
her
arms
,
from
one
end
of
which
hung
a
long
appendage
of
*NL*
drapery
;
and
when
the
walkers
turned
,
so
that
the
sun
fell
more
*NL*
directly
upon
them
,
Eustacia
could
see
that
the
object
was
a
baby
.
*NL*
She
called
Charley
,
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
who
they
were
,
though
*NL*
she
well
guessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Wildeve
and
the
nurse-girl
,
''
said
Charley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
nurse
is
carrying
the
baby
?
''
said
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
't
is
Mrs.
Wildeve
carrying
that
,
''
he
answered
,
``
and
the
nurse
*NL*
walks
behind
carrying
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
was
in
good
spirits
that
day
,
for
the
Fifth
of
November
had
*NL*
again
come
round
,
and
he
was
planning
yet
another
scheme
to
divert
*NL*
her
from
her
too
absorbing
thoughts
.
For
two
successive
years
his
*NL*
mistress
had
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
lighting
a
bonfire
on
the
*NL*
bank
overlooking
the
valley
;
but
this
year
she
had
apparently
quite
*NL*
forgotten
the
day
and
the
customary
deed
.
He
was
careful
not
to
*NL*
remind
her
,
and
went
on
with
his
secret
preparations
for
a
cheerful
*NL*
surprise
,
the
more
zealously
that
he
had
been
absent
last
time
and
*NL*
unable
to
assist
.
At
every
vacant
minute
he
hastened
to
gather
*NL*
furze-stumps
,
thorn-tree
roots
,
and
other
solid
materials
from
the
*NL*
adjacent
slopes
,
hiding
them
from
cursory
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
came
,
and
Eustacia
was
still
seemingly
unconscious
of
the
*NL*
anniversary
.
She
had
gone
indoors
after
her
survey
through
the
glass
,
*NL*
and
had
not
been
visible
since
.
As
soon
as
it
was
quite
dark
Charley
*NL*
began
to
build
the
bonfire
,
choosing
precisely
that
spot
on
the
bank
*NL*
which
Eustacia
had
chosen
at
previous
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
all
the
surrounding
bonfires
had
burst
into
existence
Charley
*NL*
kindled
his
,
and
arranged
its
fuel
so
that
it
should
not
require
*NL*
tending
for
some
time
.
He
then
went
back
to
the
house
,
and
lingered
*NL*
round
the
door
and
windows
till
she
should
by
some
means
or
other
*NL*
learn
of
his
achievement
and
come
out
to
witness
it
.
But
the
shutters
*NL*
were
closed
,
the
door
remained
shut
,
and
no
heed
whatever
seemed
to
*NL*
be
taken
of
his
performance
.
Not
liking
to
call
her
he
went
back
and
*NL*
replenished
the
fire
,
continuing
to
do
this
for
more
than
half
an
*NL*
hour
.
It
was
not
till
his
stock
of
fuel
had
greatly
diminished
that
*NL*
he
went
to
the
back
door
and
sent
in
to
beg
that
Mrs.
Yeobright
would
*NL*
open
the
window-shutters
and
see
the
sight
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
,
who
had
been
sitting
listlessly
in
the
parlour
,
started
up
*NL*
at
the
intelligence
and
flung
open
the
shutters
.
Facing
her
on
the
*NL*
bank
blazed
the
fire
,
which
at
once
sent
a
ruddy
glare
into
the
room
*NL*
where
she
was
,
and
overpowered
the
candles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
,
Charley
!
''
said
Captain
Vye
from
the
chimney-corner
.
``
But
*NL*
I
hope
it
is
not
my
wood
that
he
's
burning
...
Ah
,
it
was
this
time
*NL*
last
year
that
I
met
with
that
man
Venn
,
bringing
home
Thomasin
*NL*
Yeobright
--
to
be
sure
it
was
!
Well
,
who
would
have
thought
that
girl
's
*NL*
troubles
would
have
ended
so
well
?
What
a
snipe
you
were
in
that
*NL*
matter
,
Eustacia
!
Has
your
husband
written
to
you
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Eustacia
,
looking
vaguely
through
the
window
at
the
fire
,
*NL*
which
just
then
so
much
engaged
her
mind
that
she
did
not
resent
her
*NL*
grandfather
's
blunt
opinion
.
She
could
see
Charley
's
form
on
the
*NL*
bank
,
shovelling
and
stirring
the
fire
;
and
there
flashed
upon
her
*NL*
imagination
some
other
form
which
that
fire
might
call
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
left
the
room
,
put
on
her
garden-bonnet
and
cloak
,
and
went
*NL*
out
.
Reaching
the
bank
,
she
looked
over
with
a
wild
curiosity
and
*NL*
misgiving
,
when
Charley
said
to
her
,
with
a
pleased
sense
of
himself
,
*NL*
``
I
made
it
o
'
purpose
for
you
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
she
said
hastily
.
``
But
I
wish
you
to
put
it
out
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
soon
burn
down
,
''
said
Charley
,
rather
disappointed
.
``
Is
it
*NL*
not
a
pity
to
knock
it
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
musingly
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
in
silence
,
broken
only
by
the
crackling
of
the
flames
,
*NL*
till
Charley
,
perceiving
that
she
did
not
want
to
talk
to
him
,
moved
*NL*
reluctantly
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
remained
within
the
bank
looking
at
the
fire
,
intending
to
*NL*
go
indoors
,
yet
lingering
still
.
Had
she
not
by
her
situation
been
*NL*
inclined
to
hold
in
indifference
all
things
honoured
of
the
gods
*NL*
and
of
men
she
would
probably
have
come
away
.
But
her
state
was
so
*NL*
hopeless
that
she
could
play
with
it
.
To
have
lost
is
less
disturbing
*NL*
than
to
wonder
if
we
may
possibly
have
won
:
and
Eustacia
could
now
,
*NL*
like
other
people
at
such
a
stage
,
take
a
standing-point
outside
*NL*
herself
,
observe
herself
as
a
disinterested
spectator
,
and
think
what
*NL*
a
sport
for
Heaven
this
woman
Eustacia
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
stood
she
heard
a
sound
.
It
was
the
splash
of
a
stone
in
*NL*
the
pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Eustacia
received
the
stone
full
in
the
bosom
her
heart
could
not
*NL*
have
given
a
more
decided
thump
.
She
had
thought
of
the
possibility
*NL*
of
such
a
signal
in
answer
to
that
which
had
been
unwittingly
given
by
*NL*
Charley
;
but
she
had
not
expected
it
yet
.
How
prompt
Wildeve
was
!
Yet
*NL*
how
could
he
think
her
capable
of
deliberately
wishing
to
renew
their
*NL*
assignations
now
?
An
impulse
to
leave
the
spot
,
a
desire
to
stay
,
*NL*
struggled
within
her
;
and
the
desire
held
its
own
.
More
than
that
it
*NL*
did
not
do
,
for
she
refrained
even
from
ascending
the
bank
and
looking
*NL*
over
.
She
remained
motionless
,
not
disturbing
a
muscle
of
her
face
or
*NL*
raising
her
eyes
;
for
were
she
to
turn
up
her
face
the
fire
on
the
*NL*
bank
would
shine
upon
it
,
and
Wildeve
might
be
looking
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
second
splash
into
the
pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
he
stay
so
long
without
advancing
and
looking
over
?
Curiosity
*NL*
had
its
way
:
she
ascended
one
or
two
of
the
earth-steps
in
the
bank
*NL*
and
glanced
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
was
before
her
.
He
had
come
forward
after
throwing
the
last
*NL*
pebble
,
and
the
fire
now
shone
into
each
of
their
faces
from
the
bank
*NL*
stretching
breast-high
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
light
it
!
''
cried
Eustacia
quickly
.
``
It
was
lit
without
my
*NL*
knowledge
.
Do
n't
,
do
n't
come
over
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
been
living
here
all
these
days
without
telling
me
?
You
*NL*
have
left
your
home
.
I
fear
I
am
something
to
blame
for
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
let
in
his
mother
;
that
's
how
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
deserve
what
you
have
got
,
Eustacia
;
you
are
in
great
*NL*
misery
;
I
see
it
in
your
eyes
,
your
mouth
,
and
all
over
you
.
My
poor
,
*NL*
poor
girl
!
''
He
stepped
over
the
bank
.
``
You
are
beyond
everything
*NL*
unhappy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
not
exactly
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
pushed
too
far
--
it
is
killing
you
:
I
do
think
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
usually
quiet
breathing
had
grown
quicker
with
his
words
.
*NL*
``
I
--
I
--
''
she
began
,
and
then
burst
into
quivering
sobs
,
shaken
to
*NL*
the
very
heart
by
the
unexpected
voice
of
pity
--
a
sentiment
whose
*NL*
existence
in
relation
to
herself
she
had
almost
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
outbreak
of
weeping
took
Eustacia
herself
so
much
by
surprise
*NL*
that
she
could
not
leave
off
,
and
she
turned
aside
from
him
in
some
*NL*
shame
,
though
turning
hid
nothing
from
him
.
She
sobbed
on
desperately
;
*NL*
then
the
outpour
lessened
,
and
she
became
quieter
.
Wildeve
had
*NL*
resisted
the
impulse
to
clasp
her
,
and
stood
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
not
ashamed
of
me
,
who
used
never
to
be
a
crying
animal
?
''
*NL*
she
asked
in
a
weak
whisper
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
go
*NL*
away
?
I
wish
you
had
not
seen
quite
all
that
;
it
reveals
too
much
by
*NL*
half
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
have
wished
it
,
because
it
makes
me
as
sad
as
you
,
''
he
said
*NL*
with
emotion
and
deference
.
``
As
for
revealing
--
the
word
is
impossible
*NL*
between
us
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
send
for
you
--
do
n't
forget
it
,
Damon
;
I
am
in
pain
,
but
I
*NL*
did
not
send
for
you

As
a
wife

at

,
I
've
been
straight

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind

I
came

O

Eustacia

forgive
me
for
the
harm
I
have
done
*NL*
you
in
these
two
past
years

I
see
more
and
more
that
I
have
been
your
*NL*
ruin

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

This
place
I
live

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
your
generosity
may
naturally
make
you
say
that

But
I
am
the
*NL*
culprit

I
should
either
have
done
more
or
nothing
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
never
to
have
hunted
you
out
,
or
,
having
done
it
,
I
ought
*NL*
to
have
persisted
in
retaining
you
.
But
of
course
I
have
no
right
to
*NL*
talk
of
that
now
.
I
will
only
ask
this
:
can
I
do
anything
for
you
?
*NL*
Is
there
anything
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
a
man
can
do
to
make
*NL*
you
happier
than
you
are
at
present

If
there
is

I
will
do
it

You
*NL*
may
command
me
,
Eustacia

to
the
limit
of
my
influence

and
do
n't
*NL*
forget
that
I
am
richer
now
.
Surely
something
can
be
done
to
save
*NL*
you
from
this
!
Such
a
rare
plant
in
such
a
wild
place
it
grieves
me
*NL*
to
see

Do
you
want
anything
bought
?
Do
you
want
to
go
anywhere
?
Do
*NL*
you
want
to
escape
the
place
altogether
?
Only
say
it
,
and
I
'll
do
*NL*
anything
to
put
an
end
to
those
tears

which
but
for
me
would
never
*NL*

been
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
We

she
said
faintly
;

she
pleaded
*NL*
earnestly
,

me
to
get
to
Budmouth
harbour

``
Will
it
be

leave

``
Yes

*NL*
She
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
yes
,
sweet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
me
know
when
you
wish
to
go
.
We
shall
be
at
our
present

house
till
December
;
after
that
we
remove
to
Casterbridge

Command
me
*NL*
in
anything
till
that
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
think
of
this
,

she
said
hurriedly
.
``
Whether
I
can
honestly
*NL*
make
use
of
you
as
a
friend
,
or
must
close
with
you
as

that
*NL*
is
what
I
must
ask
myself
.
If
I
wish
to
go
and
decide
to
accept
your
*NL*
company
I
will
signal
to
you
some
evening
at
eight
o'clock
punctually

this

you
are

''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
slowly
went
up
the
steps
and
descended
into
the
darkness
*NL*
on
the
other
side
;
and
as
he
walked
he
glanced
back
,
till
the
bank
*NL*
blotted
out
her
form
from
his
further
view

*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
Argues
with
Her
Cousin
,
and
He
Writes
a
Letter
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
was
at
this
time
at
Blooms-End
,
hoping
that
Eustacia
would
*NL*
return
to
him
.
The
removal
of
furniture
had
been
accomplished
only
*NL*
that
day
,
though
Clym
had
lived
in
the
old
house
for
more
than
a
week
.
*NL*
He
had
spent
the
time
in
working
about
the
premises
,
sweeping
leaves
*NL*
from
the
garden-paths
,
cutting
dead
stalks
from
the
flower-beds
,
and
*NL*
nailing
up
creepers
which
had
been
displaced
by
the
autumn
winds
.
He
*NL*
took
no
particular
pleasure
in
these
deeds
,
but
they
formed
a
screen
*NL*
between
himself
and
despair
.
Moreover
,
it
had
become
a
religion
with
*NL*
him
to
preserve
in
good
condition
all
that
had
lapsed
from
his
*NL*
mother
's
hands
to
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
these
operations
he
was
constantly
on
the
watch
for
Eustacia
.
*NL*
That
there
should
be
no
mistake
about
her
knowing
where
to
find
him
*NL*
he
had
ordered
a
notice
board
to
be
affixed
to
the
garden
gate
at
*NL*
Alderworth
,
signifying
in
white
letters
whither
he
had
removed
.
When
a
*NL*
leaf
floated
to
the
earth
he
turned
his
head
,
thinking
it
might
be
her
*NL*
footfall
.
A
bird
searching
for
worms
in
the
mould
of
the
flower-beds
*NL*
sounded
like
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
gate
;
and
at
dusk
,
when
*NL*
soft
,
strange
ventriloquisms
came
from
holes
in
the
ground
,
hollow
*NL*
stalks
,
curled
dead
leaves
,
and
other
crannies
wherein
breezes
,
worms
,
*NL*
and
insects
can
work
their
will
,
he
fancied
that
they
were
Eustacia
,
*NL*
standing
without
and
breathing
wishes
of
reconciliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
this
hour
he
had
persevered
in
his
resolve
not
to
invite
her
*NL*
back
.
At
the
same
time
the
severity
with
which
he
had
treated
her
*NL*
lulled
the
sharpness
of
his
regret
for
his
mother
,
and
awoke
some
*NL*
of
his
old
solicitude
for
his
mother
's
supplanter
.
Harsh
feelings
*NL*
produce
harsh
usage
,
and
this
by
reaction
quenches
the
sentiments
that
*NL*
gave
it
birth
.
The
more
he
reflected
the
more
he
softened
.
But
to
*NL*
look
upon
his
wife
as
innocence
in
distress
was
impossible
,
though
he
*NL*
could
ask
himself
whether
he
had
given
her
quite
time
enough
--
if
he
*NL*
had
not
come
a
little
too
suddenly
upon
her
on
that
sombre
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
the
first
flush
of
his
anger
had
paled
he
was
disinclined
to
*NL*
ascribe
to
her
more
than
an
indiscreet
friendship
with
Wildeve
,
for
*NL*
there
had
not
appeared
in
her
manner
the
signs
of
dishonour
.
And
this
*NL*
once
admitted
,
an
absolutely
dark
interpretation
of
her
act
towards
*NL*
his
mother
was
no
longer
forced
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
fifth
November
his
thoughts
of
Eustacia
were
*NL*
intense
.
Echoes
from
those
past
times
when
they
had
exchanged
tender
*NL*
words
all
the
day
long
came
like
the
diffused
murmur
of
a
seashore
*NL*
left
miles
behind
.
``
Surely
,
''
he
said
,
``
she
might
have
brought
herself
*NL*
to
communicate
with
me
before
now
,
and
confess
honestly
what
Wildeve
*NL*
was
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
remaining
at
home
that
night
he
determined
to
go
and
see
*NL*
Thomasin
and
her
husband
.
If
he
found
opportunity
he
would
allude
to
*NL*
the
cause
of
the
separation
between
Eustacia
and
himself
,
keeping
*NL*
silence
,
however
,
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
third
person
in
his
*NL*
house
when
his
mother
was
turned
away
.
If
it
proved
that
Wildeve
was
*NL*
innocently
there
he
would
doubtless
openly
mention
it
.
If
he
were
*NL*
there
with
unjust
intentions
Wildeve
,
being
a
man
of
quick
feeling
,
*NL*
might
possibly
say
something
to
reveal
the
extent
to
which
Eustacia
*NL*
was
compromised
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
reaching
his
cousin
's
house
he
found
that
only
Thomasin
was
*NL*
at
home
,
Wildeve
being
at
that
time
on
his
way
towards
the
bonfire
*NL*
innocently
lit
by
Charley
at
Mistover
.
Thomasin
then
,
as
always
,
was
*NL*
glad
to
see
Clym
,
and
took
him
to
inspect
the
sleeping
baby
,
carefully
*NL*
screening
the
candlelight
from
the
infant
's
eyes
with
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tamsin
,
have
you
heard
that
Eustacia
is
not
with
me
now
?
''
he
said
*NL*
when
they
had
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Thomasin
,
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
that
I
have
left
Alderworth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
never
hear
tidings
from
Alderworth
unless
you
bring
them
.
What
*NL*
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
in
a
disturbed
voice
related
to
her
his
visit
to
Susan
Nunsuch
's
*NL*
boy
,
the
revelation
he
had
made
,
and
what
had
resulted
from
his
*NL*
charging
Eustacia
with
having
wilfully
and
heartlessly
done
the
deed
.
*NL*
He
suppressed
all
mention
of
Wildeve
's
presence
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
,
and
I
not
knowing
it
!
''
murmured
Thomasin
in
an
awestruck
*NL*
tone
.
``
Terrible
!
What
could
have
made
her
--
O
,
Eustacia
!
And
when
you
*NL*
found
it
out
you
went
in
hot
haste
to
her
?
Were
you
too
cruel
?
--
or
is
*NL*
she
really
so
wicked
as
she
seems
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
a
man
be
too
cruel
to
his
mother
's
enemy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
fancy
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
--
I
'll
admit
that
he
can
.
But
now
what
is
to
be
*NL*
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
it
up
again
--
if
a
quarrel
so
deadly
can
ever
be
made
up
.
I
*NL*
almost
wish
you
had
not
told
me
.
But
do
try
to
be
reconciled
.
There
*NL*
are
ways
,
after
all
,
if
you
both
wish
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
we
do
both
wish
to
make
it
up
,
''
said
Clym
.
``
If
she
*NL*
had
wished
it
,
would
she
not
have
sent
to
me
by
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
wish
to
,
and
yet
you
have
not
sent
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
;
but
I
have
been
tossed
to
and
fro
in
doubt
if
I
ought
,
after
*NL*
such
strong
provocation
.
To
see
me
now
,
Thomasin
,
gives
you
no
idea
*NL*
of
what
I
have
been
;
of
what
depths
I
have
descended
to
in
these
few
*NL*
last
days
.
O
,
it
was
a
bitter
shame
to
shut
out
my
mother
like
that
!
*NL*
Can
I
ever
forget
it
,
or
even
agree
to
see
her
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
might
not
have
known
that
anything
serious
would
come
of
it
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
she
did
not
mean
to
keep
aunt
out
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
says
herself
that
she
did
not
.
But
the
fact
remains
that
keep
*NL*
her
out
she
did

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
her
sorry
,
and
send
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
if
she
will
not
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
prove
her
guilty
,
by
showing
that
it
is
her
habit
to
nourish
*NL*
enmity
.
But
I
do
not
think
that
for
a
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
this
.
I
will
wait
for
a
day
or
two
longer

not
longer
*NL*
than
two
days
certainly
;
and
if
she
does
not
send
to

in
that
time
I
*NL*
will
indeed
send

I
thought
to
have
seen
Wildeve
here
tonight
.
*NL*
Is
he
from
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
blushed
a
little
.
``
No
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
is
merely
gone
out
*NL*
for
a
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
he
take
you
with
him
?
The
evening
is
fine

want
fresh
*NL*
air
as
well
as
he
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
care
for
going
anywhere
;
besides
,
there
is
baby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
Well
,
I
have
been
thinking
whether
I
should
not
consult
*NL*
your
husband
about
this
as
well
as
you
,
''
said
Clym
steadily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
I
would
not
,
''
she
quickly
answered
.
``
It
can
do
no
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
cousin
looked
her
in
the
face
.
No
doubt
Thomasin
was
ignorant
*NL*
that
her
husband
had
any
share
in
the
events
of
that
tragic
afternoon
;
*NL*
but
her
countenance
seemed
to
signify
that
she
concealed
some
*NL*
suspicion
or
thought
of
the
reputed
tender
relations
between
Wildeve
*NL*
and
Eustacia
in
days
gone
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
,
however
,
could
make
nothing
of
it
,
and
he
rose
to
depart
,
more
*NL*
in
doubt
than
when
he
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
write
to
her
in
a
day
or
two
?
''
said
the
young
woman
*NL*
earnestly
.
``
I
do
so
hope
the
wretched
separation
may
come
to
an
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Clym
;
``
I
do
n't
rejoice
in
my
present
state
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
left
her
and
climbed
over
the
hill
to
Blooms-End
.
Before
going
*NL*
to
bed
he
sat
down
and
wrote
the
following
letter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MY
DEAR
EUSTACIA
,
--
I
must
obey
my
heart
without
consulting
*NL*
my
reason
too
closely
.
Will
you
come
back
to
me
?
Do
so
,
and
*NL*
the
past
shall
never
be
mentioned
.
I
was
too
severe
;
but
O
,
*NL*
Eustacia
,
the
provocation
!
You
do
n't
know
,
you
never
will
*NL*
know
,
what
those
words
of
anger
cost
me
which
you
drew
down
*NL*
upon
yourself
.
All
that
an
honest
man
can
promise
you
I
*NL*
promise
now
,
which
is
that
from
me
you
shall
never
suffer
*NL*
anything
on
this
score
again
.
After
all
the
vows
we
have
*NL*
made
,
Eustacia
,
I
think
we
had
better
pass
the
remainder
of
*NL*
our
lives
in
trying
to
keep
them
.
Come
to
me
,
then
,
even
*NL*
if
you
reproach
me
.
I
have
thought
of
your
sufferings
*NL*
that
morning
on
which
I
parted
from
you
;
I
know
they
were
*NL*
genuine
,
and
they
are
as
much
as
you
ought
to
bear
.
Our
*NL*
love
must
still
continue
.
Such
hearts
as
ours
would
never
*NL*
have
been
given
us
but
to
be
concerned
with
each
other
.
I
*NL*
could
not
ask
you
back
at
first
,
Eustacia
,
for
I
was
unable
*NL*
to
persuade
myself
that
he
who
was
with
you
was
not
there
*NL*
as
a
lover
.
But
if
you
will
come
and
explain
distracting
*NL*
appearances
I
do
not
question
that
you
can
show
your
*NL*
honesty
to
me
.
Why
have
you
not
come
before
?
Do
you
think
*NL*
I
will
not
listen
to
you
?
Surely
not
,
when
you
remember
the
*NL*
kisses
and
vows
we
exchanged
under
the
summer
moon
.
Return
*NL*
then
,
and
you
shall
be
warmly
welcomed
.
I
can
no
longer
*NL*
think
of
you
to
your
prejudice
--
I
am
but
too
much
absorbed
*NL*
in
justifying
you
.
--
Your
husband
as
ever
,
*NL*
*NL*
CLYM
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
laid
it
in
his
desk
,
``
that
's
a
good
thing
*NL*
done
.
If
she
does
not
come
before
tomorrow
night
I
will
send
it
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
at
the
house
he
had
just
left
Thomasin
sat
sighing
*NL*
uneasily
.
Fidelity
to
her
husband
had
that
evening
induced
her
to
*NL*
conceal
all
suspicion
that
Wildeve
's
interest
in
Eustacia
had
not
*NL*
ended
with
his
marriage
.
But
she
knew
nothing
positive
;
and
though
*NL*
Clym
was
her
well-beloved
cousin
there
was
one
nearer
to
her
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
a
little
later
,
Wildeve
returned
from
his
walk
to
Mistover
,
*NL*
Thomasin
said
,
``
Damon
,
where
have
you
been
?
I
was
getting
quite
*NL*
frightened
,
and
thought
you
had
fallen
into
the
river
.
I
dislike
*NL*
being
in
the
house
by
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frightened
?
''
he
said
,
touching
her
cheek
as
if
she
were
some
domestic
*NL*
animal
.
``
Why
,
I
thought
nothing
could
frighten
you
.
It
is
that
you
*NL*
are
getting
proud
,
I
am
sure
,
and
do
n't
like
living
here
since
we
have
*NL*
risen
above
our
business
.
Well
,
it
is
a
tedious
matter
,
this
getting
*NL*
a
new
house
;
but
I
could
n't
have
set
about
it
sooner
,
unless
our
*NL*
ten
thousand
pounds
had
been
a
hundred
thousand
,
when
we
could
have
*NL*
afforded
to
despise
caution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
do
n't
mind
waiting
--
I
would
rather
stay
here
twelve
months
*NL*
longer
than
run
any
risk
with
baby
.
But
I
do
n't
like
your
vanishing
*NL*
so
in
the
evenings
.
There
's
something
on
your
mind
--
I
know
there
is
,
*NL*
Damon
.
You
go
about
so
gloomily
,
and
look
at
the
heath
as
if
it
were
*NL*
somebody
's
gaol
instead
of
a
nice
wild
place
to
walk
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
towards
her
with
pitying
surprise
.
``
What
,
do
you
like
Egdon
*NL*
Heath
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
what
I
was
born
near
to
;
I
admire
its
grim
old
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
,
my
dear
.
You
do
n't
know
what
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
do
.
There
's
only
one
thing
unpleasant
about
Egdon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
take
me
with
you
when
you
walk
there
.
Why
do
you
wander
so
*NL*
much
in
it
yourself
if
you
so
dislike
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
inquiry
,
though
a
simple
one
,
was
plainly
disconcerting
,
and
he
*NL*
sat
down
before
replying
.
``
I
do
n't
think
you
often
see
me
there
.
*NL*
Give
an
instance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
she
answered
triumphantly
.
``
When
you
went
out
this
evening
*NL*
I
thought
that
as
baby
was
asleep
I
would
see
where
you
were
going
to
*NL*
so
mysteriously
without
telling
me
.
So
I
ran
out
and
followed
behind
*NL*
you
.
You
stopped
at
the
place
where
the
road
forks
,
looked
round
at
*NL*
the
bonfires
,
and
then
said
,
`
Damn
it
,
I
'll
go
!
'
And
you
went
quickly
*NL*
up
the
left-hand
road
.
Then
I
stood
and
watched
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
frowned
,
afterwards
saying
,
with
a
forced
smile
,
``
Well
,
what
*NL*
wonderful
discovery
did
you
make
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
now
you
are
angry
,
and
we
wo
n't
talk
of
this
any
more
.
''
She
*NL*
went
across
to
him
,
sat
on
a
footstool
,
and
looked
up
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
he
said
,
``
that
's
how
you
always
back
out
.
We
will
go
on
*NL*
with
it
now
we
have
begun
.
What
did
you
next
see
?
I
particularly
*NL*
want
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
like
that
,
Damon
!
''
she
murmured
.
``
I
did
n't
see
anything
.
*NL*
You
vanished
out
of
sight
,
and
then
I
looked
round
at
the
bonfires
and
*NL*
came
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
this
is
not
the
only
time
you
have
dogged
my
steps
.
Are
you
*NL*
trying
to
find
out
something
bad
about
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
!
I
have
never
done
such
a
thing
before
,
and
I
should
n't
*NL*
have
done
it
now
if
words
had
not
sometimes
been
dropped
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
DO
you
mean
?
''
he
impatiently
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
--
they
say
you
used
to
go
to
Alderworth
in
the
evenings
,
and
*NL*
it
puts
into
my
mind
what
I
have
heard
about
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
turned
angrily
and
stood
up
in
front
of
her
.
``
Now
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
flourishing
his
hand
in
the
air
,
``
just
out
with
it
,
madam
!
I
demand
to
*NL*
know
what
remarks
you
have
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
heard
that
you
used
to
be
very
fond
of
Eustacia
--
nothing
more
*NL*
than
that
,
though
dropped
in
a
bit-by-bit
way
.
You
ought
not
to
be
*NL*
angry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
observed
that
her
eyes
were
brimming
with
tears
.
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
there
is
nothing
new
in
that
,
and
of
course
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
rough
*NL*
towards
you
,
so
you
need
not
cry
.
Now
,
do
n't
let
us
speak
of
the
*NL*
subject
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
no
more
was
said
,
Thomasin
being
glad
enough
of
a
reason
for
not
*NL*
mentioning
Clym
's
visit
to
her
that
evening
,
and
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Night
of
the
Sixth
of
November
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Having
resolved
on
flight
Eustacia
at
times
seemed
anxious
that
*NL*
something
should
happen
to
thwart
her
own
intention
.
The
only
event
*NL*
that
could
really
change
her
position
was
the
appearance
of
Clym
.
The
*NL*
glory
which
had
encircled
him
as
her
lover
was
departed
now
;
yet
some
*NL*
good
simple
quality
of
his
would
occasionally
return
to
her
memory
and
*NL*
stir
a
momentary
throb
of
hope
that
he
would
again
present
himself
*NL*
before
her
.
But
calmly
considered
it
was
not
likely
that
such
a
*NL*
severance
as
now
existed
would
ever
close
up
:
she
would
have
to
live
*NL*
on
as
a
painful
object
,
isolated
,
and
out
of
place
.
She
had
used
to
*NL*
think
of
the
heath
alone
as
an
uncongenial
spot
to
be
in
;
she
felt
it
*NL*
now
of
the
whole
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
evening
on
the
sixth
her
determination
to
go
away
again
*NL*
revived
.
About
four
o'clock
she
packed
up
anew
the
few
small
articles
*NL*
she
had
brought
in
her
flight
from
Alderworth
,
and
also
some
belonging
*NL*
to
her
which
had
been
left
here
:
the
whole
formed
a
bundle
not
too
*NL*
large
to
be
carried
in
her
hand
for
a
distance
of
a
mile
or
two
.
The
*NL*
scene
without
grew
darker
;
mud-coloured
clouds
bellied
downwards
from
*NL*
the
sky
like
vast
hammocks
slung
across
it
,
and
with
the
increase
of
*NL*
night
a
stormy
wind
arose
;
but
as
yet
there
was
no
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
could
not
rest
indoors
,
having
nothing
more
to
do
,
and
she
*NL*
wandered
to
and
fro
on
the
hill
,
not
far
from
the
house
she
was
soon
*NL*
to
leave
.
In
these
desultory
ramblings
she
passed
the
cottage
of
*NL*
Susan
Nunsuch
,
a
little
lower
down
than
her
grandfather
's
.
The
door
*NL*
was
ajar
,
and
a
riband
of
bright
firelight
fell
over
the
ground
*NL*
without
.
As
Eustacia
crossed
the
firebeams
she
appeared
for
an
*NL*
instant
as
distinct
as
a
figure
in
a
phantasmagoria
--
a
creature
of
*NL*
light
surrounded
by
an
area
of
darkness
:
the
moment
passed
,
and
she
*NL*
was
absorbed
in
night
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
who
was
sitting
inside
the
cottage
had
seen
and
recognized
*NL*
her
in
that
momentary
irradiation
.
This
was
Susan
herself
,
occupied
*NL*
in
preparing
a
posset
for
her
little
boy
,
who
,
often
ailing
,
was
now
*NL*
seriously
unwell
.
Susan
dropped
the
spoon
,
shook
her
fist
at
the
*NL*
vanished
figure
,
and
then
proceeded
with
her
work
in
a
musing
,
absent
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eight
o'clock
,
the
hour
at
which
Eustacia
had
promised
to
signal
*NL*
Wildeve
if
ever
she
signalled
at
all
,
she
looked
around
the
premises
*NL*
to
learn
if
the
coast
was
clear
,
went
to
the
furze-rick
,
and
pulled
*NL*
thence
a
long-stemmed
bough
of
that
fuel
.
This
she
carried
to
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
bank
,
and
,
glancing
behind
to
see
if
the
shutters
were
*NL*
all
closed
,
she
struck
a
light
,
and
kindled
the
furze
.
When
it
was
*NL*
thoroughly
ablaze
Eustacia
took
it
by
the
stem
and
waved
it
in
the
*NL*
air
above
her
head
till
it
had
burned
itself
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
gratified
,
if
gratification
were
possible
to
such
a
mood
,
by
*NL*
seeing
a
similar
light
in
the
vicinity
of
Wildeve
's
residence
a
minute
*NL*
or
two
later
.
Having
agreed
to
keep
watch
at
this
hour
every
night
,
*NL*
in
case
she
should
require
assistance
,
this
promptness
proved
how
*NL*
strictly
he
had
held
to
his
word
.
Four
hours
after
the
present
time
,
*NL*
that
is
,
at
midnight
,
he
was
to
be
ready
to
drive
her
to
Budmouth
,
as
*NL*
prearranged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
returned
to
the
house
.
Supper
having
been
got
over
she
*NL*
retired
early
,
and
sat
in
her
bedroom
waiting
for
the
time
to
go
by
.
*NL*
The
night
being
dark
and
threatening
,
Captain
Vye
had
not
strolled
out
*NL*
to
gossip
in
any
cottage
or
to
call
at
the
inn
,
as
was
sometimes
his
*NL*
custom
on
these
long
autumn
nights
;
and
he
sat
sipping
grog
alone
*NL*
downstairs
.
About
ten
o'clock
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
.
When
*NL*
the
servant
opened
it
the
rays
of
the
candle
fell
upon
the
form
of
*NL*
Fairway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
a-forced
to
go
to
Lower
Mistover
tonight
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
Mr.
*NL*
Yeobright
asked
me
to
leave
this
here
on
my
way
;
but
,
faith
,
I
put
it
*NL*
in
the
lining
of
my
hat
,
and
thought
no
more
about
it
till
I
got
back
*NL*
and
was
hasping
my
gate
before
going
to
bed
.
So
I
have
run
back
with
*NL*
it
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
in
a
letter
and
went
his
way
.
The
girl
brought
it
to
the
*NL*
captain
,
who
found
that
it
was
directed
to
Eustacia
.
He
turned
it
*NL*
over
and
over
,
and
fancied
that
the
writing
was
her
husband
's
,
though
*NL*
he
could
not
be
sure
.
However
,
he
decided
to
let
her
have
it
at
once
*NL*
if
possible
,
and
took
it
upstairs
for
that
purpose
;
but
on
reaching
*NL*
the
door
of
her
room
and
looking
in
at
the
keyhole
he
found
there
was
*NL*
no
light
within
,
the
fact
being
that
Eustacia
,
without
undressing
,
had
*NL*
flung
herself
upon
the
bed
,
to
rest
and
gather
a
little
strength
for
*NL*
her
coming
journey
.
Her
grandfather
concluded
from
what
he
saw
that
*NL*
he
ought
not
to
disturb
her
;
and
descending
again
to
the
parlour
he
*NL*
placed
the
letter
on
the
mantelpiece
to
give
it
to
her
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eleven
o'clock
he
went
to
bed
himself
,
smoked
for
some
time
in
his
*NL*
bedroom
,
put
out
his
light
at
half-past
eleven
,
and
then
,
as
was
his
*NL*
invariable
custom
,
pulled
up
the
blind
before
getting
into
bed
,
that
*NL*
he
might
see
which
way
the
wind
blew
on
opening
his
eyes
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
his
bedroom
window
commanding
a
view
of
the
flagstaff
and
*NL*
vane
.
Just
as
he
had
lain
down
he
was
surprised
to
observe
the
white
*NL*
pole
of
the
staff
flash
into
existence
like
a
streak
of
phosphorus
*NL*
drawn
downwards
across
the
shade
of
night
without
.
Only
one
*NL*
explanation
met
this
--
a
light
had
been
suddenly
thrown
upon
the
pole
*NL*
from
the
direction
of
the
house
.
As
everybody
had
retired
to
rest
the
*NL*
old
man
felt
it
necessary
to
get
out
of
bed
,
open
the
window
softly
,
*NL*
and
look
to
the
right
and
left
.
Eustacia
's
bedroom
was
lighted
up
,
*NL*
and
it
was
the
shine
from
her
window
which
had
lighted
the
pole
.
*NL*
Wondering
what
had
aroused
her
,
he
remained
undecided
at
the
window
,
*NL*
and
was
thinking
of
fetching
the
letter
to
slip
it
under
her
door
,
*NL*
when
he
heard
a
slight
brushing
of
garments
on
the
partition
dividing
*NL*
his
room
from
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
concluded
that
Eustacia
,
feeling
wakeful
,
had
gone
for
a
*NL*
book
,
and
would
have
dismissed
the
matter
as
unimportant
if
he
had
not
*NL*
also
heard
her
distinctly
weeping
as
she
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
thinking
of
that
husband
of
hers
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Ah
,
*NL*
the
silly
goose
!
she
had
no
business
to
marry
him
.
I
wonder
if
that
*NL*
letter
is
really
his
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
arose
,
threw
his
boat-cloak
round
him
,
opened
the
door
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Eustacia
!
''
There
was
no
answer
.
``
Eustacia
!
''
he
repeated
louder
,
*NL*
``
there
is
a
letter
on
the
mantelpiece
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
response
was
made
to
this
statement
save
an
imaginary
one
from
*NL*
the
wind
,
which
seemed
to
gnaw
at
the
corners
of
the
house
,
and
the
*NL*
stroke
of
a
few
drops
of
rain
upon
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
to
the
landing
,
and
stood
waiting
nearly
five
minutes
.
*NL*
Still
she
did
not
return
.
He
went
back
for
a
light
,
and
prepared
*NL*
to
follow
her
;
but
first
he
looked
into
her
bedroom
.
There
,
on
the
*NL*
outside
of
the
quilt
,
was
the
impression
of
her
form
,
showing
that
the
*NL*
bed
had
not
been
opened
;
and
,
what
was
more
significant
,
she
had
not
*NL*
taken
her
candlestick
downstairs
.
He
was
now
thoroughly
alarmed
;
and
*NL*
hastily
putting
on
his
clothes
he
descended
to
the
front
door
,
which
*NL*
he
himself
had
bolted
and
locked
.
It
was
now
unfastened
.
There
was
no
*NL*
longer
any
doubt
that
Eustacia
had
left
the
house
at
this
midnight
*NL*
hour
;
and
whither
could
she
have
gone
?
To
follow
her
was
almost
*NL*
impossible
.
Had
the
dwelling
stood
in
an
ordinary
road
,
two
persons
*NL*
setting
out
,
one
in
each
direction
,
might
have
made
sure
of
overtaking
*NL*
her
;
but
it
was
a
hopeless
task
to
seek
for
anybody
on
a
heath
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
the
practicable
directions
for
flight
across
it
from
any
point
*NL*
being
as
numerous
as
the
meridians
radiating
from
the
pole
.
Perplexed
*NL*
what
to
do
,
he
looked
into
the
parlour
,
and
was
vexed
to
find
that
the
*NL*
letter
still
lay
there
untouched
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
eleven
,
finding
that
the
house
was
silent
,
Eustacia
had
*NL*
lighted
her
candle
,
put
on
some
warm
outer
wrappings
,
taken
her
bag
in
*NL*
her
hand
,
and
,
extinguishing
the
light
again
,
descended
the
staircase
.
*NL*
When
she
got
into
the
outer
air
she
found
that
it
had
begun
to
rain
,
*NL*
and
as
she
stood
pausing
at
the
door
it
increased
,
threatening
to
come
*NL*
on
heavily
.
But
having
committed
herself
to
this
line
of
action
there
*NL*
was
no
retreating
for
bad
weather
.
Even
the
receipt
of
Clym
's
letter
*NL*
would
not
have
stopped
her
now
.
The
gloom
of
the
night
was
funereal
;
*NL*
all
nature
seemed
clothed
in
crape
.
The
spiky
points
of
the
fir
trees
*NL*
behind
the
house
rose
into
the
sky
like
the
turrets
and
pinnacles
of
*NL*
an
abbey
.
Nothing
below
the
horizon
was
visible
save
a
light
which
*NL*
was
still
burning
in
the
cottage
of
Susan
Nunsuch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
opened
her
umbrella
and
went
out
from
the
enclosure
by
*NL*
the
steps
over
the
bank
,
after
which
she
was
beyond
all
danger
of
*NL*
being
perceived
.
Skirting
the
pool
,
she
followed
the
path
towards
*NL*
Rainbarrow
,
occasionally
stumbling
over
twisted
furze-roots
,
tufts
*NL*
of
rushes
,
or
oozing
lumps
of
fleshy
fungi
,
which
at
this
season
lay
*NL*
scattered
about
the
heath
like
the
rotten
liver
and
lungs
of
some
*NL*
colossal
animal
.
The
moon
and
stars
were
closed
up
by
cloud
and
rain
*NL*
to
the
degree
of
extinction
.
It
was
a
night
which
led
the
traveller
's
*NL*
thoughts
instinctively
to
dwell
on
nocturnal
scenes
of
disaster
in
the
*NL*
chronicles
of
the
world
,
on
all
that
is
terrible
and
dark
in
history
*NL*
and
legend
--
the
last
plague
of
Egypt
,
the
destruction
of
Sennacherib
's
*NL*
host
,
the
agony
in
Gethsemane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eustacia
at
length
reached
Rainbarrow
,
and
stood
still
there
to
think
.
*NL*
Never
was
harmony
more
perfect
than
that
between
the
chaos
of
her
mind
*NL*
and
the
chaos
of
the
world
without
.
A
sudden
recollection
had
flashed
*NL*
on
her
this
moment
:
she
had
not
money
enough
for
undertaking
a
long
*NL*
journey
.
Amid
the
fluctuating
sentiments
of
the
day
her
unpractical
*NL*
mind
had
not
dwelt
on
the
necessity
of
being
well-provided
,
and
now
*NL*
that
she
thoroughly
realized
the
condition
she
sighed
bitterly
and
*NL*
ceased
to
stand
erect
,
gradually
crouching
down
under
the
umbrella
as
*NL*
if
she
were
drawn
into
the
Barrow
by
a
hand
from
beneath
.
Could
it
*NL*
be
that
she
was
to
remain
a
captive
still
?
Money
:
she
had
never
felt
*NL*
its
value
before
.
Even
to
efface
herself
from
the
country
means
were
*NL*
required
.
To
ask
Wildeve
for
pecuniary
aid
without
allowing
him
to
*NL*
accompany
her
was
impossible
to
a
woman
with
a
shadow
of
pride
left
in
*NL*
her
;
to
fly
as
his
mistress
--
and
she
knew
that
he
loved
her
--
was
of
*NL*
the
nature
of
humiliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anyone
who
had
stood
by
now
would
have
pitied
her
,
not
so
much
on
*NL*
account
of
her
exposure
to
weather
,
and
isolation
from
all
of
humanity
*NL*
except
the
mouldered
remains
inside
the
tumulus
;
but
for
that
other
*NL*
form
of
misery
which
was
denoted
by
the
slightly
rocking
movement
*NL*
that
her
feelings
imparted
to
her
person
.
Extreme
unhappiness
weighed
*NL*
visibly
upon
her
.
Between
the
drippings
of
the
rain
from
her
umbrella
*NL*
to
her
mantle
,
from
her
mantle
to
the
heather
,
from
the
heather
to
*NL*
the
earth
,
very
similar
sounds
could
be
heard
coming
from
her
lips
;
*NL*
and
the
tearfulness
of
the
outer
scene
was
repeated
upon
her
face
.
*NL*
The
wings
of
her
soul
were
broken
by
the
cruel
obstructiveness
of
all
*NL*
about
her
;
and
even
had
she
seen
herself
in
a
promising
way
of
getting
*NL*
to
Budmouth
,
entering
a
steamer
,
and
sailing
to
some
opposite
port
,
*NL*
she
would
have
been
but
little
more
buoyant
,
so
fearfully
malignant
*NL*
were
other
things
.
She
uttered
words
aloud
.
When
a
woman
in
such
*NL*
a
situation
,
neither
old
,
deaf
,
crazed
,
nor
whimsical
,
takes
upon
*NL*
herself
to
sob
and
soliloquize
aloud
there
is
something
grievous
the
*NL*
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
go
,
can
I
go
?
''
she
moaned
.
``
He
's
not
GREAT
enough
for
me
to
*NL*
give
myself
to
--
he
does
not
suffice
for
my
desire
!
...
If
he
had
been
*NL*
a
Saul
or
a
Buonaparte
--
ah
!
But
to
break
my
marriage
vow
for
him
--
it
*NL*
is
too
poor
a
luxury
!
...
And
I
have
no
money
to
go
alone
!
And
if
*NL*
I
could
,
what
comfort
to
me
?
I
must
drag
on
next
year
,
as
I
have
*NL*
dragged
on
this
year
,
and
the
year
after
that
as
before
.
How
I
have
*NL*
tried
and
tried
to
be
a
splendid
woman
,
and
how
destiny
has
been
*NL*
against
me
!
...
I
do
not
deserve
my
lot
!
''
she
cried
in
a
frenzy
of
*NL*
bitter
revolt
.
``
O
,
the
cruelty
of
putting
me
into
this
ill-conceived
*NL*
world
!
I
was
capable
of
much
;
but
I
have
been
injured
and
blighted
*NL*
and
crushed
by
things
beyond
my
control
!
O
,
how
hard
it
is
of
Heaven
*NL*
to
devise
such
tortures
for
me
,
who
have
done
no
harm
to
Heaven
at
*NL*
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
distant
light
which
Eustacia
had
cursorily
observed
in
leaving
*NL*
the
house
came
,
as
she
had
divined
,
from
the
cottage
window
of
Susan
*NL*
Nunsuch
.
What
Eustacia
did
not
divine
was
the
occupation
of
the
woman
*NL*
within
at
that
moment
.
Susan
's
sight
of
her
passing
figure
earlier
*NL*
in
the
evening
,
not
five
minutes
after
the
sick
boy
's
exclamation
,
*NL*
``
Mother
,
I
do
feel
so
bad
!
''
persuaded
the
matron
that
an
evil
*NL*
influence
was
certainly
exercised
by
Eustacia
's
propinquity
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
account
Susan
did
not
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
the
evening
's
work
*NL*
was
over
,
as
she
would
have
done
at
ordinary
times
.
To
counteract
*NL*
the
malign
spell
which
she
imagined
poor
Eustacia
to
be
working
,
the
*NL*
boy
's
mother
busied
herself
with
a
ghastly
invention
of
superstition
,
*NL*
calculated
to
bring
powerlessness
,
atrophy
,
and
annihilation
on
any
*NL*
human
being
against
whom
it
was
directed
.
It
was
a
practice
well
*NL*
known
on
Egdon
at
that
date
,
and
one
that
is
not
quite
extinct
at
the
*NL*
present
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
with
her
candle
into
an
inner
room
,
where
,
among
other
*NL*
utensils
,
were
two
large
brown
pans
,
containing
together
perhaps
a
*NL*
hundredweight
of
liquid
honey
,
the
produce
of
the
bees
during
the
*NL*
foregoing
summer
.
On
a
shelf
over
the
pans
was
a
smooth
and
solid
*NL*
yellow
mass
of
a
hemispherical
form
,
consisting
of
beeswax
from
the
*NL*
same
take
of
honey
.
Susan
took
down
the
lump
,
and
cutting
off
several
*NL*
thin
slices
,
heaped
them
in
an
iron
ladle
,
with
which
she
returned
*NL*
to
the
living-room
,
and
placed
the
vessel
in
the
hot
ashes
of
the
*NL*
fireplace
.
As
soon
as
the
wax
had
softened
to
the
plasticity
of
dough
*NL*
she
kneaded
the
pieces
together
.
And
now
her
face
became
more
intent
.
*NL*
She
began
moulding
the
wax
;
and
it
was
evident
from
her
manner
of
*NL*
manipulation
that
she
was
endeavouring
to
give
it
some
preconceived
*NL*
form
.
The
form
was
human
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
warming
and
kneading
,
cutting
and
twisting
,
dismembering
and
*NL*
re-joining
the
incipient
image
she
had
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
produced
a
shape
which
tolerably
well
resembled
a
woman
,
and
was
*NL*
about
six
inches
high
.
She
laid
it
on
the
table
to
get
cold
and
hard
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
she
took
the
candle
and
went
upstairs
to
where
the
little
*NL*
boy
was
lying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
notice
,
my
dear
,
what
Mrs.
Eustacia
wore
this
afternoon
*NL*
besides
the
dark
dress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
red
ribbon
round
her
neck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
except
sandal-shoes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
red
ribbon
and
sandal-shoes
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Nunsuch
went
and
searched
till
she
found
a
fragment
of
the
*NL*
narrowest
red
ribbon
,
which
she
took
downstairs
and
tied
round
the
*NL*
neck
of
the
image
.
Then
fetching
ink
and
a
quill
from
the
rickety
*NL*
bureau
by
the
window
,
she
blackened
the
feet
of
the
image
to
the
*NL*
extent
presumably
covered
by
shoes
;
and
on
the
instep
of
each
foot
*NL*
marked
cross-lines
in
the
shape
taken
by
the
sandal-strings
of
those
*NL*
days
.
Finally
she
tied
a
bit
of
black
thread
round
the
upper
part
of
*NL*
the
head
,
in
faint
resemblance
to
a
snood
worn
for
confining
the
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
held
the
object
at
arm
's
length
and
contemplated
it
with
a
*NL*
satisfaction
in
which
there
was
no
smile
.
To
anybody
acquainted
with
*NL*
the
inhabitants
of
Egdon
Heath
the
image
would
have
suggested
Eustacia
*NL*
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
her
work-basket
in
the
window-seat
the
woman
took
a
paper
of
*NL*
pins
,
of
the
old
long
and
yellow
sort
whose
heads
were
disposed
*NL*
to
come
off
at
their
first
usage
.
These
she
began
to
thrust
into
*NL*
the
image
in
all
directions
,
with
apparently
excruciating
energy
.
*NL*
Probably
as
many
as
fifty
were
thus
inserted
,
some
into
the
head
of
*NL*
the
wax
model
,
some
into
the
shoulders
,
some
into
the
trunk
,
some
*NL*
upwards
through
the
soles
of
the
feet
,
till
the
figure
was
completely
*NL*
permeated
with
pins
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
the
fire
.
It
had
been
of
turf
;
and
though
the
high
heap
*NL*
of
ashes
which
turf
fires
produce
was
somewhat
dark
and
dead
on
the
*NL*
outside
,
upon
raking
it
abroad
with
the
shovel
the
inside
of
the
mass
*NL*
showed
a
glow
of
red
heat
.
She
took
a
few
pieces
of
fresh
turf
from
*NL*
the
chimney-corner
and
built
them
together
over
the
glow
,
upon
which
*NL*
the
fire
brightened
.
Seizing
with
the
tongs
the
image
that
she
had
*NL*
made
of
Eustacia
,
she
held
it
in
the
heat
,
and
watched
it
as
it
began
*NL*
to
waste
slowly
away
.
And
while
she
stood
thus
engaged
there
came
*NL*
from
between
her
lips
a
murmur
of
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
strange
jargon
--
the
Lord
's
Prayer
repeated
backwards
--
the
*NL*
incantation
usual
in
proceedings
for
obtaining
unhallowed
assistance
*NL*
against
an
enemy
.
Susan
uttered
the
lugubrious
discourse
three
*NL*
times
slowly
,
and
when
it
was
completed
the
image
had
considerably
*NL*
diminished
.
As
the
wax
dropped
into
the
fire
a
long
flame
arose
from
*NL*
the
spot
,
and
curling
its
tongue
round
the
figure
ate
still
further
*NL*
into
its
substance
.
A
pin
occasionally
dropped
with
the
wax
,
and
the
*NL*
embers
heated
it
red
as
it
lay
.
*NL*

VIII
*NL*
*NL*
Rain
,
Darkness
,
and
Anxious
Wanderers
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
effigy
of
Eustacia
was
melting
to
nothing
,
and
the
fair
*NL*
woman
herself
was
standing
on
Rainbarrow
,
her
soul
in
an
abyss
of
*NL*
desolation
seldom
plumbed
by
one
so
young
,
Yeobright
sat
lonely
at
*NL*
Blooms-End
.
He
had
fulfilled
his
word
to
Thomasin
by
sending
off
*NL*
Fairway
with
the
letter
to
his
wife
,
and
now
waited
with
increased
*NL*
impatience
for
some
sound
or
signal
of
her
return
.
Were
Eustacia
*NL*
still
at
Mistover
the
very
least
he
expected
was
that
she
would
send
*NL*
him
back
a
reply
tonight
by
the
same
hand
;
though
,
to
leave
all
to
her
*NL*
inclination
,
he
had
cautioned
Fairway
not
to
ask
for
an
answer
.
If
*NL*
one
were
handed
to
him
he
was
to
bring
it
immediately
;
if
not
,
he
was
*NL*
to
go
straight
home
without
troubling
to
come
round
to
Blooms-End
*NL*
again
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
secretly
Clym
had
a
more
pleasing
hope
.
Eustacia
might
possibly
*NL*
decline
to
use
her
pen
--
it
was
rather
her
way
to
work
silently
--
and
*NL*
surprise
him
by
appearing
at
his
door
.
How
fully
her
mind
was
made
up
*NL*
to
do
otherwise
he
did
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Clym
's
regret
it
began
to
rain
and
blow
hard
as
the
evening
*NL*
advanced
.
The
wind
rasped
and
scraped
at
the
corners
of
the
house
,
*NL*
and
filliped
the
eavesdroppings
like
peas
against
the
panes
.
He
*NL*
walked
restlessly
about
the
untenanted
rooms
,
stopping
strange
noises
*NL*
in
windows
and
doors
by
jamming
splinters
of
wood
into
the
casements
*NL*
and
crevices
,
and
pressing
together
the
lead-work
of
the
quarries
*NL*
where
it
had
become
loosened
from
the
glass
.
It
was
one
of
those
*NL*
nights
when
cracks
in
the
walls
of
old
churches
widen
,
when
ancient
*NL*
stains
on
the
ceilings
of
decayed
manor
houses
are
renewed
and
*NL*
enlarged
from
the
size
of
a
man
's
hand
to
an
area
of
many
feet
.
The
*NL*
little
gate
in
the
palings
before
his
dwelling
continually
opened
and
*NL*
clicked
together
again
,
but
when
he
looked
out
eagerly
nobody
was
*NL*
there
;
it
was
as
if
invisible
shapes
of
the
dead
were
passing
in
on
*NL*
their
way
to
visit
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
ten
and
eleven
o'clock
,
finding
that
neither
Fairway
nor
*NL*
anybody
else
came
to
him
,
he
retired
to
rest
,
and
despite
his
*NL*
anxieties
soon
fell
asleep
.
His
sleep
,
however
,
was
not
very
sound
,
*NL*
by
reason
of
the
expectancy
he
had
given
way
to
,
and
he
was
easily
*NL*
awakened
by
a
knocking
which
began
at
the
door
about
an
hour
after
.
*NL*
Clym
arose
and
looked
out
of
the
window
.
Rain
was
still
falling
*NL*
heavily
,
the
whole
expanse
of
heath
before
him
emitting
a
subdued
*NL*
hiss
under
the
downpour
.
It
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
there
?
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Light
footsteps
shifted
their
position
in
the
porch
,
and
he
could
just
*NL*
distinguish
in
a
plaintive
female
voice
the
words
,
``
O
Clym
,
come
down
*NL*
and
let
me
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
flushed
hot
with
agitation
.
``
Surely
it
is
Eustacia
!
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
If
so
,
she
had
indeed
come
to
him
unawares
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hastily
got
a
light
,
dressed
himself
,
and
went
down
.
On
his
*NL*
flinging
open
the
door
the
rays
of
the
candle
fell
upon
a
woman
*NL*
closely
wrapped
up
,
who
at
once
came
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomasin
!
''
he
exclaimed
in
an
indescribable
tone
of
disappointment
.
*NL*
``
It
is
Thomasin
,
and
on
such
a
night
as
this
!
O
,
where
is
Eustacia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
it
was
,
wet
,
frightened
,
and
panting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eustacia
?
I
do
n't
know
,
Clym
;
but
I
can
think
,
''
she
said
with
much
*NL*
perturbation
.
``
Let
me
come
in
and
rest
--
I
will
explain
this
.
There
*NL*
is
a
great
trouble
brewing
--
my
husband
and
Eustacia
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
my
husband
is
going
to
leave
me
or
do
something
dreadful
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
--
Clym
,
will
you
go
and
see
?
I
have
nobody
to
help
me
*NL*
but
you
!
Eustacia
has
not
yet
come
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
breathlessly
:
``
Then
they
are
going
to
run
off
together
!
He
*NL*
came
indoors
tonight
about
eight
o'clock
and
said
in
an
off-hand
way
,
*NL*
`
Tamsie
,
I
have
just
found
that
I
must
go
a
journey
.
'
`
When
?
'
I
said
.
*NL*
`
Tonight
,
'
he
said
.
`
Where
?
'
I
asked
him
.
'
I
can
not
tell
you
at
*NL*
present
,
'
he
said
;
'
I
shall
be
back
again
tomorrow
.
'
He
then
went
and
*NL*
busied
himself
in
looking
up
his
things
,
and
took
no
notice
of
me
at
*NL*
all
.
I
expected
to
see
him
start
,
but
he
did
not
,
and
then
it
came
to
*NL*
be
ten
o'clock
,
when
he
said
,
`
You
had
better
go
to
bed
.
'
I
did
n't
*NL*
know
what
to
do
,
and
I
went
to
bed
.
I
believe
he
thought
I
fell
*NL*
asleep
,
for
half
an
hour
after
that
he
came
up
and
unlocked
the
oak
*NL*
chest
we
keep
money
in
when
we
have
much
in
the
house
and
took
out
a
*NL*
roll
of
something
which
I
believe
was
bank-notes
,
though
I
was
not
*NL*
aware
that
he
had
'em
there
.
These
he
must
have
got
from
the
bank
*NL*
when
he
went
there
the
other
day
.
What
does
he
want
bank-notes
for
,
*NL*
if
he
is
only
going
off
for
a
day
?
When
he
had
gone
down
I
thought
of
*NL*
Eustacia
,
and
how
he
had
met
her
the
night
before
--
I
know
he
did
meet
*NL*
her
,
Clym
,
for
I
followed
him
part
of
the
way
;
but
I
did
not
like
to
*NL*
tell
you
when
you
called
,
and
so
make
you
think
ill
of
him
,
as
I
did
*NL*
not
think
it
was
so
serious
.
Then
I
could
not
stay
in
bed
;
I
got
up
*NL*
and
dressed
myself
,
and
when
I
heard
him
out
in
the
stable
I
thought
*NL*
I
would
come
and
tell
you
.
So
I
came
downstairs
without
any
noise
and
*NL*
slipped
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
was
not
absolutely
gone
when
you
left
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Will
you
,
dear
Cousin
Clym
,
go
and
try
to
persuade
him
not
to
go
?
*NL*
He
takes
no
notice
of
what
I
say
,
and
puts
me
off
with
the
story
of
*NL*
his
going
on
a
journey
,
and
will
be
home
tomorrow
,
and
all
that
;
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
it
.
I
think
you
could
influence
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
,
''
said
Clym
.
``
O
,
Eustacia
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
carried
in
her
arms
a
large
bundle
;
and
having
by
this
time
*NL*
seated
herself
she
began
to
unroll
it
,
when
a
baby
appeared
as
the
*NL*
kernel
to
the
husks
--
dry
,
warm
,
and
unconscious
of
travel
or
rough
*NL*
weather
.
Thomasin
briefly
kissed
the
baby
,
and
then
found
time
to
*NL*
begin
crying
as
she
said
,
``
I
brought
baby
,
for
I
was
afraid
what
might
*NL*
happen
to
her
.
I
suppose
it
will
be
her
death
,
but
I
could
n't
leave
*NL*
her
with
Rachel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
hastily
put
together
the
logs
on
the
hearth
,
raked
abroad
the
*NL*
embers
,
which
were
scarcely
yet
extinct
,
and
blew
up
a
flame
with
the
*NL*
bellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dry
yourself
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
go
and
get
some
more
wood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
--
do
n't
stay
for
that
.
I
'll
make
up
the
fire
.
Will
you
go
at
*NL*
once
--
please
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
ran
upstairs
to
finish
dressing
himself
.
While
he
was
gone
*NL*
another
rapping
came
to
the
door
.
This
time
there
was
no
delusion
*NL*
that
it
might
be
Eustacia
's
:
the
footsteps
just
preceding
it
had
been
*NL*
heavy
and
slow
.
Yeobright
thinking
it
might
possibly
be
Fairway
with
*NL*
a
note
in
answer
,
descended
again
and
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Vye
?
''
he
said
to
a
dripping
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
my
granddaughter
here
?
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
where
is
she
?
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ought
to
know
--
you
are
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
in
name
apparently
,
''
said
Clym
with
rising
excitement
.
``
I
*NL*
believe
she
means
to
elope
tonight
with
Wildeve
.
I
am
just
going
to
*NL*
look
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
has
left
my
house
;
she
left
about
half
an
hour
ago
.
Who
's
*NL*
sitting
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cousin
Thomasin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
bowed
in
a
preoccupied
way
to
her
.
``
I
only
hope
it
is
no
*NL*
worse
than
an
elopement
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worse
?
What
's
worse
than
the
worst
a
wife
can
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
been
told
a
strange
tale
.
Before
starting
in
search
of
*NL*
her
I
called
up
Charley
,
my
stable
lad
.
I
missed
my
pistols
the
other
*NL*
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pistols
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
at
the
time
that
he
took
them
down
to
clean
.
He
has
now
*NL*
owned
that
he
took
them
because
he
saw
Eustacia
looking
curiously
at
*NL*
them
;
and
she
afterwards
owned
to
him
that
she
was
thinking
of
taking
*NL*
her
life
,
but
bound
him
to
secrecy
,
and
promised
never
to
think
of
*NL*
such
a
thing
again
.
I
hardly
suppose
she
will
ever
have
bravado
*NL*
enough
to
use
one
of
them
;
but
it
shows
what
has
been
lurking
in
her
*NL*
mind
;
and
people
who
think
of
that
sort
of
thing
once
think
of
it
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
the
pistols
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Safely
locked
up
.
O
no
,
she
wo
n't
touch
them
again
.
But
there
are
*NL*
more
ways
of
letting
out
life
than
through
a
bullet-hole
.
What
did
*NL*
you
quarrel
about
so
bitterly
with
her
to
drive
her
to
all
this
?
You
*NL*
must
have
treated
her
badly
indeed
.
Well
,
I
was
always
against
the
*NL*
marriage
,
and
I
was
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
with
me
?
''
said
Yeobright
,
paying
no
attention
to
the
*NL*
captain
's
latter
remark
.
``
If
so
I
can
tell
you
what
we
quarrelled
*NL*
about
as
we
walk
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Wildeve
's
--
that
was
her
destination
,
depend
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
here
broke
in
,
still
weeping
:
``
He
said
he
was
only
going
on
*NL*
a
sudden
short
journey
;
but
if
so
why
did
he
want
so
much
money
?
O
,
*NL*
Clym
,
what
do
you
think
will
happen
?
I
am
afraid
that
you
,
my
poor
*NL*
baby
,
will
soon
have
no
father
left
to
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
off
now
,
''
said
Yeobright
,
stepping
into
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
fain
go
with
`
ee
,
''
said
the
old
man
doubtfully
.
``
But
I
begin
*NL*
to
be
afraid
that
my
legs
will
hardly
carry
me
there
such
a
night
as
*NL*
this
.
I
am
not
so
young
as
I
was
.
If
they
are
interrupted
in
their
*NL*
flight
she
will
be
sure
to
come
back
to
me
,
and
I
ought
to
be
at
the
*NL*
house
to
receive
her
.
But
be
it
as
`
twill
I
ca
n't
walk
to
the
Quiet
*NL*
Woman
,
and
that
's
an
end
o
n't
.
I
'll
go
straight
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
perhaps
be
best
,
''
said
Clym
.
``
Thomasin
,
dry
yourself
,
and
be
*NL*
as
comfortable
as
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
he
closed
the
door
upon
her
,
and
left
the
house
in
company
*NL*
with
Captain
Vye
,
who
parted
from
him
outside
the
gate
,
taking
the
*NL*
middle
path
,
which
led
to
Mistover
.
Clym
crossed
by
the
right-hand
*NL*
track
towards
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
,
being
left
alone
,
took
off
some
of
her
wet
garments
,
*NL*
carried
the
baby
upstairs
to
Clym
's
bed
,
and
then
came
down
to
the
*NL*
sitting-room
again
,
where
she
made
a
larger
fire
,
and
began
drying
*NL*
herself
.
The
fire
soon
flared
up
the
chimney
,
giving
the
room
an
*NL*
appearance
of
comfort
that
was
doubled
by
contrast
with
the
drumming
*NL*
of
the
storm
without
,
which
snapped
at
the
window-panes
and
breathed
*NL*
into
the
chimney
strange
low
utterances
that
seemed
to
be
the
prologue
*NL*
to
some
tragedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
least
part
of
Thomasin
was
in
the
house
,
for
her
heart
being
*NL*
at
ease
about
the
little
girl
upstairs
she
was
mentally
following
Clym
*NL*
on
his
journey
.
Having
indulged
in
this
imaginary
peregrination
for
*NL*
some
considerable
interval
,
she
became
impressed
with
a
sense
of
the
*NL*
intolerable
slowness
of
time
.
But
she
sat
on
.
The
moment
then
came
*NL*
when
she
could
scarcely
sit
longer
;
and
it
was
like
a
satire
on
her
*NL*
patience
to
remember
that
Clym
could
hardly
have
reached
the
inn
as
*NL*
yet
.
At
last
she
went
to
the
baby
's
bedside
.
The
child
was
sleeping
*NL*
soundly
;
but
her
imagination
of
possibly
disastrous
events
at
her
*NL*
home
,
the
predominance
within
her
of
the
unseen
over
the
seen
,
*NL*
agitated
her
beyond
endurance
.
She
could
not
refrain
from
going
down
*NL*
and
opening
the
door
.
The
rain
still
continued
,
the
candlelight
*NL*
falling
upon
the
nearest
drops
and
making
glistening
darts
of
them
as
*NL*
they
descended
across
the
throng
of
invisible
ones
behind
.
To
plunge
*NL*
into
that
medium
was
to
plunge
into
water
slightly
diluted
with
air
.
*NL*
But
the
difficulty
of
returning
to
her
house
at
this
moment
made
her
*NL*
all
the
more
desirous
of
doing
so
:
anything
was
better
than
suspense
.
*NL*
``
I
have
come
here
well
enough
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
why
should
n't
I
go
back
*NL*
again
?
It
is
a
mistake
for
me
to
be
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hastily
fetched
the
infant
,
wrapped
it
up
,
cloaked
herself
as
*NL*
before
,
and
shoveling
the
ashes
over
the
fire
,
to
prevent
accidents
,
*NL*
went
into
the
open
air
.
Pausing
first
to
put
the
door
key
in
its
*NL*
old
place
behind
the
shutter
,
she
resolutely
turned
her
face
to
the
*NL*
confronting
pile
of
firmamental
darkness
beyond
the
palings
,
and
*NL*
stepped
into
its
midst
.
But
Thomasin
's
imagination
being
so
actively
*NL*
engaged
elsewhere
,
the
night
and
the
weather
had
for
her
no
terror
*NL*
beyond
that
of
their
actual
discomfort
and
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
soon
ascending
Blooms-End
valley
and
traversing
the
*NL*
undulations
on
the
side
of
the
hill
.
The
noise
of
the
wind
over
the
*NL*
heath
was
shrill
,
and
as
if
it
whistled
for
joy
at
finding
a
night
*NL*
so
congenial
as
this
.
Sometimes
the
path
led
her
to
hollows
between
*NL*
thickets
of
tall
and
dripping
bracken
,
dead
,
though
not
yet
prostrate
,
*NL*
which
enclosed
her
like
a
pool
.
When
they
were
more
than
usually
tall
*NL*
she
lifted
the
baby
to
the
top
of
her
head
,
that
it
might
be
out
of
*NL*
the
reach
of
their
drenching
fronds
.
On
higher
ground
,
where
the
wind
*NL*
was
brisk
and
sustained
,
the
rain
flew
in
a
level
flight
without
*NL*
sensible
descent
,
so
that
it
was
beyond
all
power
to
imagine
the
*NL*
remoteness
of
the
point
at
which
it
left
the
bosoms
of
the
clouds
.
*NL*
Here
self-defence
was
impossible
,
and
individual
drops
stuck
into
*NL*
her
like
the
arrows
into
Saint
Sebastian
.
She
was
enabled
to
avoid
*NL*
puddles
by
the
nebulous
paleness
which
signified
their
presence
,
*NL*
though
beside
anything
less
dark
than
the
heath
they
themselves
would
*NL*
have
appeared
as
blackness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
in
spite
of
all
this
Thomasin
was
not
sorry
that
she
had
started
.
*NL*
To
her
there
were
not
,
as
to
Eustacia
,
demons
in
the
air
,
and
malice
*NL*
in
every
bush
and
bough
.
The
drops
which
lashed
her
face
were
not
*NL*
scorpions
,
but
prosy
rain
;
Egdon
in
the
mass
was
no
monster
whatever
,
*NL*
but
impersonal
open
ground
.
Her
fears
of
the
place
were
rational
,
*NL*
her
dislikes
of
its
worst
moods
reasonable
.
At
this
time
it
was
in
*NL*
her
view
a
windy
,
wet
place
,
in
which
a
person
might
experience
much
*NL*
discomfort
,
lose
the
path
without
care
,
and
possibly
catch
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
path
is
well
known
the
difficulty
at
such
times
of
keeping
*NL*
therein
is
not
altogether
great
,
from
its
familiar
feel
to
the
feet
;
*NL*
but
once
lost
it
is
irrecoverable
.
Owing
to
her
baby
,
who
somewhat
*NL*
impeded
Thomasin
's
view
forward
and
distracted
her
mind
,
she
did
at
*NL*
last
lose
the
track
.
This
mishap
occurred
when
she
was
descending
an
*NL*
open
slope
about
two-thirds
home
.
Instead
of
attempting
,
by
wandering
*NL*
hither
and
thither
,
the
hopeless
task
of
finding
such
a
mere
thread
,
*NL*
she
went
straight
on
,
trusting
for
guidance
to
her
general
knowledge
*NL*
of
the
contours
,
which
was
scarcely
surpassed
by
Clym
's
or
by
that
of
*NL*
the
heath-croppers
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Thomasin
reached
a
hollow
and
began
to
discern
through
the
*NL*
rain
a
faint
blotted
radiance
,
which
presently
assumed
the
oblong
form
*NL*
of
an
open
door
.
She
knew
that
no
house
stood
hereabouts
,
and
was
*NL*
soon
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
door
by
its
height
above
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
is
Diggory
Venn
's
van
,
surely
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
secluded
spot
near
Rainbarrow
was
,
she
knew
,
often
Venn
's
*NL*
chosen
centre
when
staying
in
this
neighbourhood
;
and
she
guessed
at
*NL*
once
that
she
had
stumbled
upon
this
mysterious
retreat
.
The
question
*NL*
arose
in
her
mind
whether
or
not
she
should
ask
him
to
guide
her
into
*NL*
the
path
.
In
her
anxiety
to
reach
home
she
decided
that
she
would
*NL*
appeal
to
him
,
notwithstanding
the
strangeness
of
appearing
before
*NL*
his
eyes
at
this
place
and
season
.
But
when
,
in
pursuance
of
this
*NL*
resolve
,
Thomasin
reached
the
van
and
looked
in
she
found
it
to
be
*NL*
untenanted
;
though
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
reddleman
's
.
*NL*
The
fire
was
burning
in
the
stove
,
the
lantern
hung
from
the
nail
.
*NL*
Round
the
doorway
the
floor
was
merely
sprinkled
with
rain
,
and
not
*NL*
saturated
,
which
told
her
that
the
door
had
not
long
been
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
stood
uncertainly
looking
in
Thomasin
heard
a
footstep
*NL*
advancing
from
the
darkness
behind
her
,
and
turning
,
beheld
the
*NL*
well-known
form
in
corduroy
,
lurid
from
head
to
foot
,
the
lantern
*NL*
beams
falling
upon
him
through
an
intervening
gauze
of
raindrops
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
went
down
the
slope
,
''
he
said
,
without
noticing
her
*NL*
face
.
``
How
do
you
come
back
here
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Diggory
?
''
said
Thomasin
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
said
Venn
,
still
unperceiving
.
``
And
why
were
you
*NL*
crying
so
just
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
Diggory
!
do
n't
you
know
me
?
''
said
she
.
``
But
of
course
you
do
n't
,
*NL*
wrapped
up
like
this
.
What
do
you
mean
?
I
have
not
been
crying
here
,
*NL*
and
I
have
not
been
here
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
then
came
nearer
till
he
could
see
the
illuminated
side
of
her
*NL*
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Wildeve
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
starting
.
``
What
a
time
for
us
to
meet
!
*NL*
And
the
baby
too
!
What
dreadful
thing
can
have
brought
you
out
on
such
*NL*
a
night
as
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
immediately
answer
;
and
without
asking
her
permission
he
*NL*
hopped
into
his
van
,
took
her
by
the
arm
,
and
drew
her
up
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
continued
when
they
stood
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
lost
my
way
coming
from
Blooms-End
,
and
I
am
in
a
great
hurry
*NL*
to
get
home
.
Please
show
me
as
quickly
as
you
can
!
It
is
so
silly
of
*NL*
me
not
to
know
Egdon
better
,
and
I
can
not
think
how
I
came
to
lose
the
*NL*
path
.
Show
me
quickly
,
Diggory
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
.
I
will
go
with
`
ee
.
But
you
came
to
me
before
this
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Wildeve
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
came
this
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
strange
.
I
was
lying
down
here
asleep
about
five
minutes
ago
,
*NL*
with
the
door
shut
to
keep
out
the
weather
,
when
the
brushing
of
a
*NL*
woman
's
clothes
over
the
heath-bushes
just
outside
woke
me
up
-LRB-
for
I
*NL*
do
n't
sleep
heavy
-RRB-
,
and
at
the
same
time
I
heard
a
sobbing
or
crying
*NL*
from
the
same
woman
.
I
opened
my
door
and
held
out
my
lantern
,
and
*NL*
just
as
far
as
the
light
would
reach
I
saw
a
woman
:
she
turned
her
*NL*
head
when
the
light
sheened
on
her
,
and
then
hurried
on
downhill
.
I
*NL*
hung
up
the
lantern
,
and
was
curious
enough
to
pull
on
my
things
and
*NL*
dog
her
a
few
steps
,
but
I
could
see
nothing
of
her
any
more
.
That
*NL*
was
where
I
had
been
when
you
came
up
;
and
when
I
saw
you
I
thought
*NL*
you
were
the
same
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
was
one
of
the
heath-folk
going
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
could
n't
be
.
'T
is
too
late
.
The
noise
of
her
gown
over
the
*NL*
he
`
th
was
of
a
whistling
sort
that
nothing
but
silk
will
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
I
,
then
.
My
dress
is
not
silk

you
see
...
Are
we
anywhere
*NL*
in
a
line
between
Mistover
and
the
inn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
;
not
far
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
wonder
if
it
was
she
!
Diggory
,
I
must
go
at
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
jumped
down
from
the
van
before
he
was
aware
,
when
Venn
unhooked
*NL*
the
lantern
and
leaped
down
after
her
.
``
I
'll
take
the
baby
,
ma'am
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
You
must
be
tired
out
by
the
weight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
delivered
the
baby
into
Venn
's
*NL*
hands
.
``
Do
n't
squeeze
her
,
Diggory
,
''
she
said
,
``
or
hurt
her
little
*NL*
arm
;
and
keep
the
cloak
close
over
her
like
this
,
so
that
the
rain
may
*NL*
not
drop
in
her
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Venn
earnestly
.
``
As
if
I
could
hurt
anything
belonging
*NL*
to
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
meant
accidentally
,
''
said
Thomasin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
baby
is
dry
enough
,
but
you
are
pretty
wet
,
''
said
the
reddleman
*NL*
when
,
in
closing
the
door
of
his
cart
to
padlock
it
,
he
noticed
on
the
*NL*
floor
a
ring
of
water
drops
where
her
cloak
had
hung
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
followed
him
as
he
wound
right
and
left
to
avoid
the
larger
*NL*
bushes
,
stopping
occasionally
and
covering
the
lantern
,
while
he
*NL*
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
gain
some
idea
of
the
position
of
*NL*
Rainbarrow
above
them
,
which
it
was
necessary
to
keep
directly
behind
*NL*
their
backs
to
preserve
a
proper
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
the
rain
does
not
fall
upon
baby
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
sure
.
May
I
ask
how
old
he
is
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
!
''
said
Thomasin
reproachfully
.
``
Anybody
can
see
better
than
that
*NL*
in
a
moment
.
She
is
nearly
two
months
old
.
How
far
is
it
now
to
the
*NL*
inn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
over
a

of
a
mile

*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
walk
a
little
faster
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
you
could
not
keep
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
anxious
to
get
there
.
Ah
,
there
is
a
light
from
the
*NL*
window
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
not
from
the
window
.
That
's
a
gig-lamp
,
to
the
best
of
my
*NL*
belief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
''
said
Thomasin
in
despair
.
``
I
wish
I
had
been
there
sooner
--
give
*NL*
me
the
baby
,
Diggory
--
you
can
go
back
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
all
the
way
,
''
said
Venn
.
``
There
is
a
quag
between
us
and
*NL*
that
light
,
and
you
will
walk
into
it
up
to
your
neck
unless
I
take
*NL*
you
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
light
is
at
the
inn
,
and
there
is
no
quag
in
front
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
the
light
is
below
the
inn
some
two
or
three
hundred
yards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
said
Thomasin
hurriedly
.
``
Go
towards
the
light
,
and
not
*NL*
towards
the
inn

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Venn
,
swerving
round
in
obedience
;
and
,
after
a
pause
,
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
this
great
trouble
is

I
think
you

have
proved

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
some
things
that
can
not
be

can
not
be
told
to

And
then
*NL*
her
heart
rose
into
her
throat
,
and
she
could
say
no
more

*NL*
*NL*
Having
seen
Eustacia
's
signal
from
the
hill
at
eight
o'clock
,
Wildeve
*NL*
immediately
prepared
to
assist
her
in
her
flight
,
and
,
as
he
hoped
,
*NL*
accompany
her
.
He
was
somewhat
perturbed
,
and
his
manner
of
informing
*NL*
Thomasin
that
he
was
going
on
a
journey
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
*NL*
rouse
her
suspicions
.
When
she
had
gone
to
bed
he
collected
the
few
*NL*
articles
he
would
require
,
and
went
upstairs
to
the
money-chest
,
*NL*
whence
he
took
a
tolerably
bountiful
sum
in
notes
,
which
had
been
*NL*
advanced
to
him
on
the
property
he
was
so
soon
to
have
in
possession
,
*NL*
to
defray
expenses
incidental
to
the
removal
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
went
to
the
stable
and
coach-house
to
assure
himself
that
the
*NL*
horse
,
gig
,
and
harness
were
in
a
fit
condition
for
a
long
drive
.
*NL*
Nearly
half
an
hour
was
spent
thus
,
and
on
returning
to
the
house
*NL*
Wildeve
had
no
thought
of
Thomasin
being
anywhere
but
in
bed
.
He
had
*NL*
told
the
stable-lad
not
to
stay
up
,
leading
the
boy
to
understand
that
*NL*
his
departure
would
be
at
three
or
four
in
the
morning
;
for
this
,
*NL*
though
an
exceptional
hour
,
was
less
strange
than
midnight
,
the
time
*NL*
actually
agreed
on
,
the
packet
from
Budmouth
sailing
between
one
and
*NL*
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
all
was
quiet
,
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
.
By
no
*NL*
effort
could
he
shake
off
the
oppression
of
spirits
which
he
had
*NL*
experienced
ever
since
his
last
meeting
with
Eustacia
,
but
he
hoped
*NL*
there
was
that
in
his
situation
which
money
could
cure
.
He
had
*NL*
persuaded
himself
that
to
act
not
ungenerously
towards
his
gentle
*NL*
wife
by
settling
on
her
the
half
of
his
property
,
and
with
chivalrous
*NL*
devotion
towards
another
and
greater
woman
by
sharing
her
fate
,
was
*NL*
possible
.
And
though
he
meant
to
adhere
to
Eustacia
's
instructions
to
*NL*
the
letter
,
to
deposit
her
where
she
wished
and
to
leave
her
,
should
*NL*
that
be
her
will
,
the
spell
that
she
had
cast
over
him
intensified
,
*NL*
and
his
heart
was
beating
fast
in
the
anticipated
futility
of
such
*NL*
commands
in
the
face
of
a
mutual
wish
that
they
should
throw
in
their
*NL*
lot
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
not
allow
himself
to
dwell
long
upon
these
conjectures
,
*NL*
maxims
,
and
hopes
,
and
at
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
he
again
went
*NL*
softly
to
the
stable
,
harnessed
the
horse
,
and
lit
the
lamps
;
whence
,
*NL*
taking
the
horse
by
the
head
,
he
led
him
with
the
covered
car
out
of
*NL*
the
yard
to
a
spot
by
the
roadside
some
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
*NL*
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Wildeve
waited
,
slightly
sheltered
from
the
driving
rain
by
a
*NL*
high
bank
that
had
been
cast
up
at
this
place
.
Along
the
surface
of
*NL*
the
road
where
lit
by
the
lamps
the
loosened
gravel
and
small
stones
*NL*
scudded
and
clicked
together
before
the
wind
,
which
,
leaving
them
*NL*
in
heaps
,
plunged
into
the
heath
and
boomed
across
the
bushes
into
*NL*
darkness
.
Only
one
sound
rose
above
this
din
of
weather
,
and
that
was
*NL*
the
roaring
of
a
ten-hatch
weir
to
the
southward
,
from
a
river
in
the
*NL*
meads
which
formed
the
boundary
of
the
heath
in
this
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lingered
on
in
perfect
stillness
till
he
began
to
fancy
that
the
*NL*
midnight
hour
must
have
struck
.
A
very
strong
doubt
had
arisen
in
his
*NL*
mind
if
Eustacia
would
venture
down
the
hill
in
such
weather
;
yet
*NL*
knowing
her
nature
he
felt
that
she
might
.
``
Poor
thing
!
't
is
like
her
*NL*
ill-luck
,
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
turned
to
the
lamp
and
looked
at
his
watch
.
To
his
*NL*
surprise
it
was
nearly
a
quarter
past
midnight
.
He
now
wished
that
he
*NL*
had
driven
up
the
circuitous
road
to
Mistover
,
a
plan
not
adopted
*NL*
because
of
the
enormous
length
of
the
route
in
proportion
to
that
*NL*
of
the
pedestrian
's
path
down
the
open
hillside
,
and
the
consequent
*NL*
increase
of
labour
for
the
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
a
footstep
approached
;
but
the
light
of
the
lamps
being
*NL*
in
a
different
direction
the
comer
was
not
visible
.
The
step
paused
,
*NL*
then
came
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eustacia
?
''
said
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
person
came
forward
,
and
the
light
fell
upon
the
form
of
Clym
,
*NL*
glistening
with
wet
,
whom
Wildeve
immediately
recognized
;
but
Wildeve
,
*NL*
who
stood
behind
the
lamp
,
was
not
at
once
recognized
by
Yeobright
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
as
if
in
doubt
whether
this
waiting
vehicle
could
have
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
the
flight
of
his
wife
or
not
.
The
sight
of
*NL*
Yeobright
at
once
banished
Wildeve
's
sober
feelings
,
who
saw
him
again
*NL*
as
the
deadly
rival
from
whom
Eustacia
was
to
be
kept
at
all
hazards
.
*NL*
Hence
Wildeve
did
not
speak
,
in
the
hope
that
Clym
would
pass
by
*NL*
without
particular
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
both
hung
thus
in
hesitation
a
dull
sound
became
audible
*NL*
above
the
storm
and
wind
.
Its
origin
was
unmistakable
--
it
was
the
*NL*
fall
of
a
body
into
the
stream
in
the
adjoining
mead
,
apparently
at
*NL*
a
point
near
the
weir
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
started
.
``
Good
God
!
can
it
be
she
?
''
said
Clym
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
it
be
she
?
''
said
Wildeve
,
in
his
alarm
forgetting
that
he
*NL*
had
hitherto
screened
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
--
that
's
you
,
you
traitor
,
is
it
?
''
cried
Yeobright
.
``
Why
should
*NL*
it
be
she
?
Because
last
week
she
would
have
put
an
end
to
her
life
if
*NL*
she
had
been
able
.
She
ought
to
have
been
watched
!
Take
one
of
the
*NL*
lamps
and
come
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
seized
the
one
on
his
side
and
hastened
on
;
Wildeve
did
*NL*
not
wait
to
unfasten
the
other
,
but
followed
at
once
along
the
*NL*
meadow-track
to
the
weir
,
a
little
in
the
rear
of
Clym
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shadwater
Weir
had
at
its
foot
a
large
circular
pool
,
fifty
feet
in
*NL*
diameter
,
into
which
the
water
flowed
through
ten
huge
hatches
,
raised
*NL*
and
lowered
by
a
winch
and
cogs
in
the
ordinary
manner
.
The
sides
of
*NL*
the
pool
were
of
masonry
,
to
prevent
the
water
from
washing
away
the
*NL*
bank
;
but
the
force
of
the
stream
in
winter
was
sometimes
such
as
*NL*
to
undermine
the
retaining
wall
and
precipitate
it
into
the
hole
.
*NL*
Clym
reached
the
hatches
,
the
framework
of
which
was
shaken
to
its
*NL*
foundations
by
the
velocity
of
the
current
.
Nothing
but
the
froth
of
*NL*
the
waves
could
be
discerned
in
the
pool
below
.
He
got
upon
the
plank
*NL*
bridge
over
the
race
,
and
holding
to
the
rail
,
that
the
wind
might
not
*NL*
blow
him
off
,
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
.
There
he
leant
*NL*
over
the
wall
and
lowered
the
lamp
,
only
to
behold
the
vortex
formed
*NL*
at
the
curl
of
the
returning
current
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wildeve
meanwhile
had
arrived
on
the
former
side
,
and
the
light
from
*NL*
Yeobright
's
lamp
shed
a
flecked
and
agitated
radiance
across
the
*NL*
weir
pool
,
revealing
to
the
ex-engineer
the
tumbling
courses
of
the
*NL*
currents
from
the
hatches
above
.
Across
this
gashed
and
puckered
*NL*
mirror
a
dark
body
was
slowly
borne
by
one
of
the
backward
currents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
my
darling
!
''
exclaimed
Wildeve
in
an
agonized
voice
;
and
,
without
*NL*
showing
sufficient
presence
of
mind
even
to
throw
off
his
greatcoat
,
*NL*
he
leaped
into
the
boiling
caldron
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
could
now
also
discern
the
floating
body
,
though
but
*NL*
indistinctly
;
and
imagining
from
Wildeve
's
plunge
that
there
was
life
*NL*
to
be
saved
he
was
about
to
leap
after
.
Bethinking
himself
of
a
wiser
*NL*
plan
he
placed
the
lamp
against
a
post
to
make
it
stand
upright
,
and
*NL*
running
round
to
the
lower
part
of
the
pool
,
where
there
was
no
wall
,
*NL*
he
sprang
in
and
boldly
waded
upwards
towards
the
deeper
portion
.
*NL*
Here
he
was
taken
off
his
legs
,
and
in
swimming
was
carried
round
into
*NL*
the
centre
of
the
basin
,
where
he
perceived
Wildeve
struggling
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
hasty
actions
were
in
progress
here
,
Venn
and
Thomasin
had
*NL*
been
toiling
through
the
lower
corner
of
the
heath
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
the
light
.
They
had
not
been
near
enough
to
the
river
to
hear
the
*NL*
plunge
,
but
they
saw
the
removal
of
the
carriage-lamp
,
and
watched
its
*NL*
motion
into
the
mead
.
As
soon
as
they
reached
the
car
and
horse
Venn
*NL*
guessed
that
something
new
was
amiss
,
and
hastened
to
follow
in
the
*NL*
course
of
the
moving
light
.
Venn
walked
faster
than
Thomasin
,
and
*NL*
came
to
the
weir
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lamp
placed
against
the
post
by
Clym
still
shone
across
the
water
,
*NL*
and
the
reddleman
observed
something
floating
motionless
.
Being
*NL*
encumbered
with
the
infant
,
he
ran
back
to
meet
Thomasin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
the
baby
,
please
,
Mrs.
Wildeve
,
''
he
said
hastily
.
``
Run
home
*NL*
with
her
,
call
the
stable-lad
,
and
make
him
send
down
to
me
any
men
*NL*
who
may
be
living
near
.
Somebody
has
fallen
into
the
weir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
took
the
child
and
ran
.
When
she
came
to
the
covered
car
the
*NL*
horse
,
though
fresh
from
the
stable
,
was
standing
perfectly
still
,
as
*NL*
if
conscious
of
misfortune
.
She
saw
for
the
first
time
whose
it
was
.
*NL*
She
nearly
fainted
,
and
would
have
been
unable
to
proceed
another
step
*NL*
but
that
the
necessity
of
preserving
the
little
girl
from
harm
nerved
*NL*
her
to
an
amazing
self-control
.
In
this
agony
of
suspense
she
entered
*NL*
the
house
,
put
the
baby
in
a
place
of
safety
,
woke
the
lad
and
the
*NL*
female
domestic
,
and
ran
out
to
give
the
alarm
at
the
nearest
cottage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Diggory
,
having
returned
to
the
brink
of
the
pool
,
observed
that
the
*NL*
small
upper
hatches
or
floats
were
withdrawn
.
He
found
one
of
these
*NL*
lying
upon
the
grass
,
and
taking
it
under
one
arm
,
and
with
his
*NL*
lantern
in
his
hand
,
entered
at
the
bottom
of
the
pool
as
Clym
had
*NL*
done
.
As
soon
as
he
began
to
be
in
deep
water
he
flung
himself
across
*NL*
the
hatch
;
thus
supported
he
was
able
to
keep
afloat
as
long
as
he
*NL*
chose
,
holding
the
lantern
aloft
with
his
disengaged
hand
.
Propelled
*NL*
by
his
feet
he
steered
round
and
round
the
pool
,
ascending
each
*NL*
time
by
one
of
the
back
streams
and
descending
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
current
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
could
see
nothing
.
Then
amidst
the
glistening
of
the
*NL*
whirlpools
and
the
white
clots
of
foam
he
distinguished
a
woman
's
*NL*
bonnet
floating
alone
.
His
search
was
now
under
the
left
wall
,
when
*NL*
something
came
to
the
surface
almost
close
beside
him
.
It
was
not
,
as
*NL*
he
had
expected
,
a
woman
,
but
a
man
.
The
reddleman
put
the
ring
of
*NL*
the
lantern
between
his
teeth
,
seized
the
floating
man
by
the
collar
,
*NL*
and
,
holding
on
to
the
hatch
with
his
remaining
arm
,
struck
out
into
*NL*
the
strongest
race
,
by
which
the
unconscious
man
,
the
hatch
,
and
*NL*
himself
were
carried
down
the
stream
.
As
soon
as
Venn
found
his
feet
*NL*
dragging
over
the
pebbles
of
the
shallower
part
below
he
secured
his
*NL*
footing
and
waded
towards
the
brink
.
There
,
where
the
water
stood
at
*NL*
about
the
height
of
his
waist
,
he
flung
away
the
hatch
,
and
attempted
*NL*
to
drag
forth
the
man
.
This
was
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
,
and
he
*NL*
found
as
the
reason
that
the
legs
of
the
unfortunate
stranger
were
*NL*
tightly
embraced
by
the
arms
of
another
man
,
who
had
hitherto
been
*NL*
entirely
beneath
the
surface
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
his
heart
bounded
to
hear
footsteps
running
towards
*NL*
him
,
and
two
men
,
roused
by
Thomasin
,
appeared
at
the
brink
above
.
*NL*
They
ran
to
where
Venn
was
,
and
helped
him
in
lifting
out
the
*NL*
apparently
drowned
persons
,
separating
them
,
and
laying
them
out
upon
*NL*
the
grass
.
Venn
turned
the
light
upon
their
faces
.
The
one
who
had
*NL*
been
uppermost
was
Yeobright
;
he
who
had
been
completely
submerged
was
*NL*
Wildeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
must
search
the
hole
again
,
''
said
Venn
.
``
A
woman
is
in
there
*NL*
somewhere
.
Get
a
pole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
men
went
to
the
foot-bridge
and
tore
off
the
handrail
.
The
*NL*
reddleman
and
the
two
others
then
entered
the
water
together
from
*NL*
below
as
before
,
and
with
their
united
force
probed
the
pool
forwards
*NL*
to
where
it
sloped
down
to
its
central
depth
.
Venn
was
not
mistaken
*NL*
in
supposing
that
any
person
who
had
sunk
for
the
last
time
would
*NL*
be
washed
down
to
this
point
,
for
when
they
had
examined
to
about
*NL*
half-way
across
something
impeded
their
thrust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pull
it
forward
,
''
said
Venn
,
and
they
raked
it
in
with
the
pole
till
*NL*
it
was
close
to
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
vanished
under
the
stream
,
and
came
up
with
an
armful
of
wet
*NL*
drapery
enclosing
a
woman
's
cold
form
,
which
was
all
that
remained
of
*NL*
the
desperate
Eustacia
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
bank
there
stood
Thomasin
,
in
a
stress
of
grief
,
*NL*
bending
over
the
two
unconscious
ones
who
already
lay
there
.
The
*NL*
horse
and
cart
were
brought
to
the
nearest
point
in
the
road
,
and
it
*NL*
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
only
to
place
the
three
in
the
vehicle
.
*NL*
Venn
led
on
the
horse
,
supporting
Thomasin
upon
his
arm
,
and
the
two
*NL*
men
followed
,
till
they
reached
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
who
had
been
shaken
out
of
her
sleep
by
Thomasin
had
hastily
*NL*
dressed
herself
and
lighted
a
fire
,
the
other
servant
being
left
to
*NL*
snore
on
in
peace
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
The
insensible
forms
of
*NL*
Eustacia
,
Clym
,
and
Wildeve
were
then
brought
in
and
laid
on
the
*NL*
carpet
,
with
their
feet
to
the
fire
,
when
such
restorative
processes
*NL*
as
could
be
thought
of
were
adopted
at
once
,
the
stableman
being
in
*NL*
the
meantime
sent
for
a
doctor
.
But
there
seemed
to
be
not
a
whiff
*NL*
of
life
left
in
either
of
the
bodies
.
Then
Thomasin
,
whose
stupor
of
*NL*
grief
had
been
thrust
off
awhile
by
frantic
action
,
applied
a
bottle
*NL*
of
hartshorn
to
Clym
's
nostrils
,
having
tried
it
in
vain
upon
the
*NL*
othertwo
.
He
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clym
's
alive
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
soon
breathed
distinctly
,
and
again
and
again
did
she
attempt
to
*NL*
revive
her
husband
by
the
same
means
;
but
Wildeve
gave
no
sign
.
There
*NL*
was
too
much
reason
to
think
that
he
and
Eustacia
both
were
for
ever
*NL*
beyond
the
reach
of
stimulating
perfumes
.
Their
exertions
did
not
*NL*
relax
till
the
doctor
arrived
,
when
one
by
one
,
the
senseless
three
*NL*
were
taken
upstairs
and
put
into
warm
beds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
soon
felt
himself
relieved
from
further
attendance
,
and
went
*NL*
to
the
door
,
scarcely
able
yet
to
realize
the
strange
catastrophe
*NL*
that
had
befallen
the
family
in
which
he
took
so
great
an
interest
.
*NL*
Thomasin
surely
would
be
broken
down
by
the
sudden
and
overwhelming
*NL*
nature
of
this
event
.
No
firm
and
sensible
Mrs.
Yeobright
lived
now
*NL*
to
support
the
gentle
girl
through
the
ordeal
;
and
,
whatever
an
*NL*
unimpassioned
spectator
might
think
of
her
loss
of
such
a
husband
*NL*
as
Wildeve
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
for
the
moment
she
was
*NL*
distracted
and
horrified
by
the
blow
.
As
for
himself
,
not
being
*NL*
privileged
to
go
to
her
and
comfort
her
,
he
saw
no
reason
for
waiting
*NL*
longer
in
a
house
where
he
remained
only
as
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
across
the
heath
to
his
van
.
The
fire
was
not
yet
out
,
*NL*
and
everything
remained
as
he
had
left
it
.
Venn
now
bethought
himself
*NL*
of
his
clothes
,
which
were
saturated
with
water
to
the
weight
of
lead
.
*NL*
He
changed
them
,
spread
them
before
the
fire
,
and
lay
down
to
sleep
.
*NL*
But
it
was
more
than
he
could
do
to
rest
here
while
excited
by
a
vivid
*NL*
imagination
of
the
turmoil
they
were
in
at
the
house
he
had
quitted
,
*NL*
and
,
blaming
himself
for
coming
away
,
he
dressed
in
another
suit
,
*NL*
locked
up
the
door
,
and
again
hastened
across
to
the
inn
.
Rain
was
*NL*
still
falling
heavily
when
he
entered
the
kitchen
.
A
bright
fire
was
*NL*
shining
from
the
hearth
,
and
two
women
were
bustling
about
,
one
of
*NL*
whom
was
Olly
Dowden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
is
it
going
on
now
?
''
said
Venn
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Yeobright
is
better
;
but
Mrs.
Yeobright
and
Mr.
Wildeve
are
dead
*NL*
and
cold
.
The
doctor
says
they
were
quite
gone
before
they
were
out
*NL*
of
the
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
thought
as
much
when
I
hauled
'em
up
.
And
Mrs.
Wildeve
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
as
well
as
can
be
expected
.
The
doctor
had
her
put
between
*NL*
blankets
,
for
she
was
almost
as
wet
as
they
that
had
been
in
the
*NL*
river
,
poor
young
thing
.
You
do
n't
seem
very
dry
,
reddleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
't
is
not
much
.
I
have
changed
my
things
.
This
is
only
a
little
*NL*
dampness
I
've
got
coming
through
the
rain
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
by
the
fire
.
Mis
`
ess
says
you
be
to
have
whatever
you
want
,
*NL*
and
she
was
sorry
when
she
was
told
that
you
'd
gone
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
drew
near
to
the
fireplace
,
and
looked
into
the
flames
in
an
*NL*
absent
mood
.
The
steam
came
from
his
leggings
and
ascended
the
*NL*
chimney
with
the
smoke
,
while
he
thought
of
those
who
were
upstairs
.
*NL*
Two
were
corpses
,
one
had
barely
escaped
the
jaws
of
death
,
another
*NL*
was
sick
and
a
widow
.
The
last
occasion
on
which
he
had
lingered
by
*NL*
that
fireplace
was
when
the
raffle
was
in
progress
;
when
Wildeve
*NL*
was
alive
and
well
;
Thomasin
active
and
smiling
in
the
next
room
;
*NL*
Yeobright
and
Eustacia
just
made
husband
and
wife
,
and
Mrs.
Yeobright
*NL*
living
at
Blooms-End
.
It
had
seemed
at
that
time
that
the
then
*NL*
position
of
affairs
was
good
for
at
least
twenty
years
to
come
.
Yet
,
*NL*
of
all
the
circle
,
he
himself
was
the
only
one
whose
situation
had
not
*NL*
materially
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
ruminated
a
footstep
descended
the
stairs
.
It
was
the
nurse
,
*NL*
who
brought
in
her
hand
a
rolled
mass
of
wet
paper
.
The
woman
was
*NL*
so
engrossed
with
her
occupation
that
she
hardly
saw
Venn
.
She
took
*NL*
from
a
cupboard
some
pieces
of
twine
,
which
she
strained
across
the
*NL*
fireplace
,
tying
the
end
of
each
piece
to
the
firedog
,
previously
*NL*
pulled
forward
for
the
purpose
,
and
,
unrolling
the
wet
papers
,
she
*NL*
began
pinning
them
one
by
one
to
the
strings
in
a
manner
of
clothes
*NL*
on
a
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
be
they
?
''
said
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
master
's
bank-notes
,
''
she
answered
.
``
They
were
found
in
his
*NL*
pocket
when
they
undressed
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
was
not
coming
back
again
for
some
time
?
''
said
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
we
shall
never
know
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
was
loth
to
depart
,
for
all
on
earth
that
interested
him
lay
*NL*
under
this
roof
.
As
nobody
in
the
house
had
any
more
sleep
that
*NL*
night
,
except
the
two
who
slept
for
ever
,
there
was
no
reason
why
*NL*
he
should
not
remain
.
So
he
retired
into
the
niche
of
the
fireplace
*NL*
where
he
had
used
to
sit
,
and
there
he
continued
,
watching
the
steam
*NL*
from
the
double
row
of
bank-notes
as
they
waved
backwards
and
forwards
*NL*
in
the
draught
of
the
chimney
till
their
flaccidity
was
changed
to
*NL*
dry
crispness
throughout
.
Then
the
woman
came
and
unpinned
them
,
and
,
*NL*
folding
them
together
,
carried
the
handful
upstairs
.
Presently
the
*NL*
doctor
appeared
from
above
with
the
look
of
a
man
who
could
do
no
*NL*
more
,
and
,
pulling
on
his
gloves
,
went
out
of
the
house
,
the
trotting
*NL*
of
his
horse
soon
dying
away
upon
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
four
o'clock
there
was
a
gentle
knock
at
the
door
.
It
was
from
*NL*
Charley
,
who
had
been
sent
by
Captain
Vye
to
inquire
if
anything
had
*NL*
been
heard
of
Eustacia
.
The
girl
who
admitted
him
looked
in
his
face
*NL*
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
answer
to
return
,
and
showed
him
in
to
*NL*
where
Venn
was
seated
,
saying
to
the
reddleman
,
``
Will
you
tell
him
,
*NL*
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
told
.
Charley
's
only
utterance
was
a
feeble
,
indistinct
sound
.
*NL*
He
stood
quite
still
;
then
he
burst
out
spasmodically
,
``
I
shall
see
*NL*
her
once
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
you
may
see
her
,
''
said
Diggory
gravely
.
``
But
had
n't
you
*NL*
better
run
and
tell
Captain
Vye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
Only
I
do
hope
I
shall
see
her
just
once
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
,
''
said
a
low
voice
behind
;
and
starting
round
they
beheld
*NL*
by
the
dim
light
a
thin
,
pallid
,
almost
spectral
form
,
wrapped
in
a
*NL*
blanket
,
and
looking
like
Lazarus
coming
from
the
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Yeobright
.
Neither
Venn
nor
Charley
spoke
,
and
Clym
continued
,
*NL*
``
You
shall
see
her
.
There
will
be
time
enough
to
tell
the
captain
*NL*
when
it
gets
daylight
.
You
would
like
to
see
her
too
--
would
you
not
,
*NL*
Diggory
?
She
looks
very
beautiful
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
assented
by
rising
to
his
feet
,
and
with
Charley
he
followed
Clym
*NL*
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
,
where
he
took
off
his
boots
;
Charley
*NL*
did
the
same
.
They
followed
Yeobright
upstairs
to
the
landing
,
where
*NL*
there
was
a
candle
burning
,
which
Yeobright
took
in
his
hand
,
and
with
*NL*
it
led
the
way
into
an
adjoining
room
.
Here
he
went
to
the
bedside
*NL*
and
folded
back
the
sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
silently
looking
upon
Eustacia
,
who
,
as
she
lay
there
still
*NL*
in
death
,
eclipsed
all
her
living
phases
.
Pallor
did
not
include
all
*NL*
the
quality
of
her
complexion
,
which
seemed
more
than
whiteness
;
*NL*
it
was
almost
light
.
The
expression
of
her
finely
carved
mouth
was
*NL*
pleasant
,
as
if
a
sense
of
dignity
had
just
compelled
her
to
leave
*NL*
off
speaking
.
Eternal
rigidity
had
seized
upon
it
in
a
momentary
*NL*
transition
between
fervour
and
resignation
.
Her
black
hair
was
looser
*NL*
now
than
either
of
them
had
ever
seen
it
before
,
and
surrounded
her
*NL*
brow
like
a
forest
.
The
stateliness
of
look
which
had
been
almost
*NL*
too
marked
for
a
dweller
in
a
country
domicile
had
at
last
found
an
*NL*
artistically
happy
background
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
spoke
,
till
at
length
Clym
covered
her
and
turned
aside
.
``
Now
*NL*
come
here
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
to
a
recess
in
the
same
room
,
and
there
,
on
a
smaller
bed
,
*NL*
lay
another
figure
--
Wildeve
.
Less
repose
was
visible
in
his
face
than
*NL*
in
Eustacia
's
,
but
the
same
luminous
youthfulness
overspread
it
,
and
*NL*
the
least
sympathetic
observer
would
have
felt
at
sight
of
him
now
*NL*
that
he
was
born
for
a
higher
destiny
than
this
.
The
only
sign
upon
*NL*
him
of
his
recent
struggle
for
life
was
in
his
finger-tips
,
which
were
*NL*
worn
and
sacrificed
in
his
dying
endeavours
to
obtain
a
hold
on
the
*NL*
face
of
the
weir-wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
's
manner
had
been
so
quiet
,
he
had
uttered
so
few
syllables
*NL*
since
his
reappearance
,
that
Venn
imagined
him
resigned
.
It
was
only
*NL*
when
they
had
left
the
room
and
stood
upon
the
landing
that
the
true
*NL*
state
of
his
mind
was
apparent
.
Here
he
said
,
with
a
wild
smile
,
*NL*
inclining
his
head
towards
the
chamber
in
which
Eustacia
lay
,
``
She
is
*NL*
the
second
woman
I
have
killed
this
year
.
I
was
a
great
cause
of
my
*NL*
mother
's
death
,
and
I
am
the
chief
cause
of
hers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
said
Venn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
spoke
cruel
words
to
her
,
and
she
left
my
house
.
I
did
not
invite
*NL*
her
back
till
it
was
too
late
.
It
is
I
who
ought
to
have
drowned
*NL*
myself
.
It
would
have
been
a
charity
to
the
living
had
the
river
*NL*
overwhelmed
me
and
borne
her
up
.
But
I
can
not
die
.
Those
who
ought
*NL*
to
have
lived
lie
dead
;
and
here
am
I
alive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ca
n't
charge
yourself
with
crimes
in
that
way
,
''
said
Venn
.
*NL*
``
You
may
as
well
say
that
the
parents
be
the
cause
of
a
murder
by
the
*NL*
child
,
for
without
the
parents
the
child
would
never
have
been
begot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Venn
,
that
is
very
true
;
but
you
do
n't
know
all
the
*NL*
circumstances
.
If
it
had
pleased
God
to
put
an
end
to
me
it
would
*NL*
have
been
a
good
thing
for
all
.
But
I
am
getting
used
to
the
horror
*NL*
of
my
existence
.
They
say
that
a
time
comes
when
men
laugh
at
misery
*NL*
through
long
acquaintance
with
it
.
Surely
that
time
will
soon
come
*NL*
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
aim
has
always
been
good
,
''
said
Venn
.
``
Why
should
you
say
such
*NL*
desperate
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
are
not
desperate
.
They
are
only
hopeless
;
and
my
great
*NL*
regret
is
that
for
what
I
have
done
no
man
or
law
can
punish
me
!

The
Inevitable
Movement
Onward
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
of
the
deaths
of
Eustacia
and
Wildeve
was
told
throughout
*NL*
Egdon
,
and
far
beyond
,
for
many
weeks
and
months
.
All
the
known
*NL*
incidents
of
their
love
were
enlarged
,
distorted
,
touched
up
,
and
*NL*
modified
,
till
the
original
reality
bore
but
a
slight
resemblance
to
*NL*
the
counterfeit
presentation
by
surrounding
tongues
.
Yet
,
upon
the
*NL*
whole
,
neither
the
man
nor
the
woman
lost
dignity
by
sudden
death
.
*NL*
Misfortune
had
struck
them
gracefully
,
cutting
off
their
erratic
*NL*
histories
with
a
catastrophic
dash
,
instead
of
,
as
with
many
,
*NL*
attenuating
each
life
to
an
uninteresting
meagreness
,
through
long
*NL*
years
of
wrinkles
,
neglect
,
and
decay
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
those
most
nearly
concerned
the
effect
was
somewhat
different
.
*NL*
Strangers
who
had
heard
of
many
such
cases
now
merely
heard
of
one
*NL*
more
;
but
immediately
where
a
blow
falls
no
previous
imaginings
*NL*
amount
to
appreciable
preparation
for
it
.
The
very
suddenness
of
*NL*
her
bereavement
dulled
,
to
some
extent
,
Thomasin
's
feelings
;
yet
,
*NL*
irrationally
enough
,
a
consciousness
that
the
husband
she
had
lost
*NL*
ought
to
have
been
a
better
man
did
not
lessen
her
mourning
at
all
.
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
this
fact
seemed
at
first
to
set
off
the
dead
husband
*NL*
in
his
young
wife
's
eyes
,
and
to
be
the
necessary
cloud
to
the
*NL*
rainbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
horrors
of
the
unknown
had
passed
.
Vague
misgivings
about
her
*NL*
future
as
a
deserted
wife
were
at
an
end
.
The
worst
had
once
been
*NL*
matter
of
trembling
conjecture
;
it
was
now
matter
of
reason
only
,
*NL*
a
limited
badness
.
Her
chief
interest
,
the
little
Eustacia
,
still
*NL*
remained
.
There
was
humility
in
her
grief
,
no
defiance
in
her
*NL*
attitude
;
and
when
this
is
the
case
a
shaken
spirit
is
apt
to
be
*NL*
stilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Could
Thomasin
's
mournfulness
now
and
Eustacia
's
serenity
during
life
*NL*
have
been
reduced
to
common
measure
,
they
would
have
touched
the
same
*NL*
mark
nearly
.
But
Thomasin
's
former
brightness
made
shadow
of
that
*NL*
which
in
a
sombre
atmosphere
was
light
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spring
came
and
calmed
her
;
the
summer
came
and
soothed
her
;
the
*NL*
autumn
arrived
,
and
she
began
to
be
comforted
,
for
her
little
girl
was
*NL*
strong
and
happy
,
growing
in
size
and
knowledge
every
day
.
Outward
*NL*
events
flattered
Thomasin
not
a
little
.
Wildeve
had
died
intestate
,
*NL*
and
she
and
the
child
were
his
only
relatives
.
When
administration
*NL*
had
been
granted
,
all
the
debts
paid
,
and
the
residue
of
her
husband
's
*NL*
uncle
's
property
had
come
into
her
hands
,
it
was
found
that
the
sum
*NL*
waiting
to
be
invested
for
her
own
and
the
child
's
benefit
was
little
*NL*
less
than
ten
thousand
pounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
should
she
live
?
The
obvious
place
was
Blooms-End
.
The
old
*NL*
rooms
,
it
is
true
,
were
not
much
higher
than
the
between-decks
of
a
*NL*
frigate
,
necessitating
a
sinking
in
the
floor
under
the
new
clock-case
*NL*
she
brought
from
the
inn
,
and
the
removal
of
the
handsome
brass
knobs
*NL*
on
its
head
,
before
there
was
height
for
it
to
stand
;
but
,
such
as
the
*NL*
rooms
were
,
there
were
plenty
of
them
,
and
the
place
was
endeared
to
*NL*
her
by
every
early
recollection
.
Clym
very
gladly
admitted
her
as
a
*NL*
tenant
,
confining
his
own
existence
to
two
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
*NL*
back
staircase
,
where
he
lived
on
quietly
,
shut
off
from
Thomasin
and
*NL*
the
three
servants
she
had
thought
fit
to
indulge
in
now
that
she
*NL*
was
a
mistress
of
money
,
going
his
own
ways
,
and
thinking
his
own
*NL*
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
sorrows
had
made
some
change
in
his
outward
appearance
;
and
yet
*NL*
the
alteration
was
chiefly
within
.
It
might
have
been
said
that
he
*NL*
had
a
wrinkled
mind
.
He
had
no
enemies
,
and
he
could
get
nobody
to
*NL*
reproach
him
,
which
was
why
he
so
bitterly
reproached
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
sometimes
think
he
had
been
ill-used
by
fortune
,
so
far
as
*NL*
to
say
that
to
be
born
is
a
palpable
dilemma
,
and
that
instead
of
*NL*
men
aiming
to
advance
in
life
with
glory
they
should
calculate
how
*NL*
to
retreat
out
of
it
without
shame
.
But
that
he
and
his
had
been
*NL*
sarcastically
and
pitilessly
handled
in
having
such
irons
thrust
into
*NL*
their
souls
he
did
not
maintain
long
.
It
is
usually
so
,
except
with
*NL*
the
sternest
of
men
.
Human
beings
,
in
their
generous
endeavour
to
*NL*
construct
a
hypothesis
that
shall
not
degrade
a
First
Cause
,
have
*NL*
always
hesitated
to
conceive
a
dominant
power
of
lower
moral
quality
*NL*
than
their
own
;
and
,
even
while
they
sit
down
and
weep
by
the
waters
*NL*
of
Babylon
,
invent
excuses
for
the
oppression
which
prompts
their
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
though
words
of
solace
were
vainly
uttered
in
his
presence
,
he
*NL*
found
relief
in
a
direction
of
his
own
choosing
when
left
to
himself
.
*NL*
For
a
man
of
his
habits
the
house
and
the
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
*NL*
year
which
he
had
inherited
from
his
mother
were
enough
to
supply
all
*NL*
worldly
needs
.
Resources
do
not
depend
upon
gross
amounts
,
but
upon
*NL*
the
proportion
of
spendings
to
takings
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
frequently
walked
the
heath
alone
,
when
the
past
seized
upon
*NL*
him
with
its
shadowy
hand
,
and
held
him
there
to
listen
to
its
*NL*
tale
.
His
imagination
would
then
people
the
spot
with
its
ancient
*NL*
inhabitants
:
forgotten
Celtic
tribes
trod
their
tracks
about
him
,
*NL*
and
he
could
almost
live
among
them
,
look
in
their
faces
,
and
see
*NL*
them
standing
beside
the
barrows
which
swelled
around
,
untouched
*NL*
and
perfect
as
at
the
time
of
their
erection
.
Those
of
the
dyed
*NL*
barbarians
who
had
chosen
the
cultivable
tracts
were
,
in
comparison
*NL*
with
those
who
had
left
their
marks
here
,
as
writers
on
paper
beside
*NL*
writers
on
parchment
.
Their
records
had
perished
long
ago
by
the
*NL*
plough
,
while
the
works
of
these
remained
.
Yet
they
all
had
lived
*NL*
and
died
unconscious
of
the
different
fates
awaiting
their
relics
.
*NL*
It
reminded
him
that
unforeseen
factors
operate
in
the
evolution
of
*NL*
immortality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winter
again
came
round
,
with
its
winds
,
frosts
,
tame
robins
,
and
*NL*
sparkling
starlight
.
The
year
previous
Thomasin
had
hardly
been
*NL*
conscious
of
the
season
's
advance
;
this
year
she
laid
her
heart
open
*NL*
to
external
influences
of
every
kind
.
The
life
of
this
sweet
cousin
,
*NL*
her
baby
,
and
her
servants
,
came
to
Clym
's
senses
only
in
the
form
of
*NL*
sounds
through
a
wood
partition
as
he
sat
over
books
of
exceptionally
*NL*
large
type
;
but
his
ear
became
at
last
so
accustomed
to
these
slight
*NL*
noises
from
the
other
part
of
the
house
that
he
almost
could
witness
*NL*
the
scenes
they
signified
.
A
faint
beat
of
half-seconds
conjured
up
*NL*
Thomasin
rocking
the
cradle
,
a
wavering
hum
meant
that
she
was
singing
*NL*
the
baby
to
sleep
,
a
crunching
of
sand
as
between
millstones
raised
*NL*
the
picture
of
Humphrey
's
,
Fairway
's
,
or
Sam
's
heavy
feet
crossing
the
*NL*
stone
floor
of
the
kitchen
;
a
light
boyish
step
,
and
a
gay
tune
in
a
*NL*
high
key
,
betokened
a
visit
from
Grandfer
Cantle
;
a
sudden
break-off
*NL*
in
the
Grandfer
's
utterances
implied
the
application
to
his
lips
of
a
*NL*
mug
of
small
beer
,
a
bustling
and
slamming
of
doors
meant
starting
to
*NL*
go
to
market
;
for
Thomasin
,
in
spite
of
her
added
scope
of
gentility
,
*NL*
led
a
ludicrously
narrow
life
,
to
the
end
that
she
might
save
every
*NL*
possible
pound
for
her
little
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
summer
day
Clym
was
in
the
garden
,
immediately
outside
the
parlour
*NL*
window
,
which
was
as
usual
open
.
He
was
looking
at
the
pot-flowers
on
*NL*
the
sill
;
they
had
been
revived
and
restored
by
Thomasin
to
the
state
*NL*
in
which
his
mother
had
left
them
.
He
heard
a
slight
scream
from
*NL*
Thomasin
,
who
was
sitting
inside
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
how
you
frightened
me
!
''
she
said
to
some
one
who
had
entered
.
``
I
*NL*
thought
you
were
the
ghost
of
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
was
curious
enough
to
advance
a
little
further
and
look
in
at
the
*NL*
window
.
To
his
astonishment
there
stood
within
the
room
Diggory
Venn
,
*NL*
no
longer
a
reddleman
,
but
exhibiting
the
strangely
altered
hues
of
*NL*
an
ordinary
Christian
countenance
,
white
shirt-front
,
light
flowered
*NL*
waistcoat
,
blue-spotted
neckerchief
,
and
bottle-green
coat
.
Nothing
*NL*
in
this
appearance
was
at
all
singular
but
the
fact
of
its
great
*NL*
difference
from
what
he
had
formerly
been
.
Red
,
and
all
approach
to
*NL*
red
,
was
carefully
excluded
from
every
article
of
clothes
upon
him
;
*NL*
for
what
is
there
that
persons
just
out
of
harness
dread
so
much
as
*NL*
reminders
of
the
trade
which
has
enriched
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
went
round
to
the
door
and
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
so
alarmed
!
''
said
Thomasin
,
smiling
from
one
to
the
other
.
``
I
*NL*
could
n't
believe
that
he
had
got
white
of
his
own
accord
!
It
seemed
*NL*
supernatural
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
up
dealing
in
reddle
last
Christmas
,
''
said
Venn
.
``
It
was
a
*NL*
profitable
trade
,
and
I
found
that
by
that
time
I
had
made
enough
to
*NL*
take
the
dairy
of
fifty
cows
that
my
father
had
in
his
lifetime
.
I
*NL*
always
thought
of
getting
to
that
place
again
if
I
changed
at
all
,
and
*NL*
now
I
am
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
manage
to
become
white
,
Diggory
?
''
Thomasin
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
turned
so
by
degrees
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
much
better
than
ever
you
did
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
appeared
confused
;
and
Thomasin
,
seeing
how
inadvertently
she
*NL*
had
spoken
to
a
man
who
might
possibly
have
tender
feelings
for
*NL*
her
still
,
blushed
a
little
.
Clym
saw
nothing
of
this
,
and
added
*NL*
good-humouredly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
have
to
frighten
Thomasin
's
baby
with
,
now
you
have
*NL*
become
a
human
being
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
Diggory
,
''
said
Thomasin
,
``
and
stay
to
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
moved
as
if
he
would
retire
to
the
kitchen
,
when
Thomasin
said
*NL*
with
pleasant
pertness
as
she
went
on
with
some
sewing
,
``
Of
course
*NL*
you
must
sit
down
here
.
And
where
does
your
fifty-cow
dairy
lie
,
Mr.
*NL*
Venn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Stickleford
--
about
two
miles
to
the
right
of
Alderworth
,
ma'am
,
*NL*
where
the
meads
begin
.
I
have
thought
that
if
Mr.
Yeobright
would
*NL*
like
to
pay
me
a
visit
sometimes
he
should
n't
stay
away
for
want
of
*NL*
asking
.
I
'll
not
bide
to
tea
this
afternoon
,
thank
`
ee
,
for
I
've
got
*NL*
something
on
hand
that
must
be
settled
.
'T
is
Maypole-day
tomorrow
,
*NL*
and
the
Shadwater
folk
have
clubbed
with
a
few
of
your
neighbours
here
*NL*
to
have
a
pole
just
outside
your
palings
in
the
heath
,
as
it
is
a
nice
*NL*
green
place
.
''
Venn
waved
his
elbow
towards
the
patch
in
front
of
the
*NL*
house
.
``
I
have
been
talking
to
Fairway
about
it
,
''
he
continued
,
``
and
*NL*
I
said
to
him
that
before
we
put
up
the
pole
it
would
be
as
well
to
*NL*
ask
Mrs.
Wildeve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
say
nothing
against
it
,
''
she
answered
.
``
Our
property
does
not
*NL*
reach
an
inch
further
than
the
white
palings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
might
not
like
to
see
a
lot
of
folk
going
crazy
round
a
*NL*
stick
,
under
your
very
nose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
no
objection
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
soon
after
went
away
,
and
in
the
evening
Yeobright
strolled
as
*NL*
far
as
Fairway
's
cottage
.
It
was
a
lovely
May
sunset
,
and
the
birch
*NL*
trees
which
grew
on
this
margin
of
the
vast
Egdon
wilderness
had
put
*NL*
on
their
new
leaves
,
delicate
as
butterflies
'
wings
,
and
diaphanous
as
*NL*
amber
.
Beside
Fairway
's
dwelling
was
an
open
space
recessed
from
the
*NL*
road
,
and
here
were
now
collected
all
the
young
people
from
within
a
*NL*
radius
of
a
couple
of
miles
.
The
pole
lay
with
one
end
supported
on
a
*NL*
trestle
,
and
women
were
engaged
in
wreathing
it
from
the
top
downwards
*NL*
with
wildflowers
.
The
instincts
of
merry
England
lingered
on
here
*NL*
with
exceptional
vitality
,
and
the
symbolic
customs
which
tradition
*NL*
has
attached
to
each
season
of
the
year
were
yet
a
reality
on
Egdon
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
the
impulses
of
all
such
outlandish
hamlets
are
pagan
*NL*
still
:
in
these
spots
homage
to
nature
,
self-adoration
,
frantic
*NL*
gaieties
,
fragments
of
Teutonic
rites
to
divinities
whose
names
are
*NL*
forgotten
,
seem
in
some
way
or
other
to
have
survived
mediaeval
*NL*
doctrine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
did
not
interrupt
the
preparations
,
and
went
home
again
.
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
when
Thomasin
withdrew
the
curtains
of
her
bedroom
*NL*
window
,
there
stood
the
Maypole
in
the
middle
of
the
green
,
its
top
*NL*
cutting
into
the
sky
.
It
had
sprung
up
in
the
night
,
or
rather
early
*NL*
morning
,
like
Jack
's
bean-stalk
.
She
opened
the
casement
to
get
a
*NL*
better
view
of
the
garlands
and
posies
that
adorned
it
.
The
sweet
*NL*
perfume
of
the
flowers
had
already
spread
into
the
surrounding
air
,
*NL*
which
,
being
free
from
every
taint
,
conducted
to
her
lips
a
full
*NL*
measure
of
the
fragrance
received
from
the
spire
of
blossom
in
its
*NL*
midst
.
At
the
top
of
the
pole
were
crossed
hoops
decked
with
small
*NL*
flowers
;
beneath
these
came
a
milk-white
zone
of
Maybloom
;
then
a
zone
*NL*
of
bluebells
,
then
of
cowslips
,
then
of
lilacs
,
then
of
ragged-robins
,
*NL*
daffodils
,
and
so
on
,
till
the
lowest
stage
was
reached
.
Thomasin
*NL*
noticed
all
these
,
and
was
delighted
that
the
May
revel
was
to
be
so
*NL*
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
afternoon
came
people
began
to
gather
on
the
green
,
and
Yeobright
*NL*
was
interested
enough
to
look
out
upon
them
from
the
open
window
*NL*
of
his
room
.
Soon
after
this
Thomasin
walked
out
from
the
door
*NL*
immediately
below
and
turned
her
eyes
up
to
her
cousin
's
face
.
She
*NL*
was
dressed
more
gaily
than
Yeobright
had
ever
seen
her
dressed
since
*NL*
the
time
of
Wildeve
's
death
,
eighteen
months
before
;
since
the
day
of
*NL*
her
marriage
even
she
had
not
exhibited
herself
to
such
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
pretty
you
look
today
,
Thomasin
!
''
he
said
.
``
Is
it
because
of
the
*NL*
Maypole
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
altogether
.
''
And
then
she
blushed
and
dropped
her
eyes
,
which
*NL*
he
did
not
specially
observe
,
though
her
manner
seemed
to
him
to
be
*NL*
rather
peculiar
,
considering
that
she
was
only
addressing
himself
.
*NL*
Could
it
be
possible
that
she
had
put
on
her
summer
clothes
to
please
*NL*
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
recalled
her
conduct
towards
him
throughout
the
last
few
weeks
,
*NL*
when
they
had
often
been
working
together
in
the
garden
,
just
as
they
*NL*
had
formerly
done
when
they
were
boy
and
girl
under
his
mother
's
eye
.
*NL*
What
if
her
interest
in
him
were
not
so
entirely
that
of
a
relative
as
*NL*
it
had
formerly
been
?
To
Yeobright
any
possibility
of
this
sort
was
*NL*
a
serious
matter
;
and
he
almost
felt
troubled
at
the
thought
of
it
.
*NL*
Every
pulse
of
loverlike
feeling
which
had
not
been
stilled
during
*NL*
Eustacia
's
lifetime
had
gone
into
the
grave
with
her
.
His
passion
for
*NL*
her
had
occurred
too
far
on
in
his
manhood
to
leave
fuel
enough
on
*NL*
hand
for
another
fire
of
that
sort
,
as
may
happen
with
more
boyish
*NL*
loves
.
Even
supposing
him
capable
of
loving
again
,
that
love
would
be
*NL*
a
plant
of
slow
and
laboured
growth
,
and
in
the
end
only
small
and
*NL*
sickly
,
like
an
autumn-hatched
bird
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
distressed
by
this
new
complexity
that
when
the
enthusiastic
*NL*
brass
band
arrived
and
struck
up
,
which
it
did
about
five
o'clock
,
*NL*
with
apparently
wind
enough
among
its
members
to
blow
down
his
house
,
*NL*
he
withdrew
from
his
rooms
by
the
back
door
,
went
down
the
garden
,
*NL*
through
the
gate
in
the
hedge
,
and
away
out
of
sight
.
He
could
not
*NL*
bear
to
remain
in
the
presence
of
enjoyment
today
,
though
he
had
tried
*NL*
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
was
seen
of
him
for
four
hours
.
When
he
came
back
by
the
same
*NL*
path
it
was
dusk
,
and
the
dews
were
coating
every
green
thing
.
The
*NL*
boisterous
music
had
ceased
;
but
,
entering
the
premises
as
he
did
from
*NL*
behind
,
he
could
not
see
if
the
May
party
had
all
gone
till
he
had
*NL*
passed
through
Thomasin
's
division
of
the
house
to
the
front
door
.
*NL*
Thomasin
was
standing
within
the
porch
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
reproachfully
.
``
You
went
away
just
when
it
began
,
*NL*
Clym
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
felt
I
could
not
join
in
.
You
went
out
with
them
,
of
course
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
appeared
to
be
dressed
on
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
could
not
go
out
alone
;
so
many
people
were
there
.
One
is
*NL*
there
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
strained
his
eyes
across
the
dark-green
patch
beyond
the
*NL*
paling
,
and
near
the
black
form
of
the
Maypole
he
discerned
a
shadowy
*NL*
figure
,
sauntering
idly
up
and
down
.
``
Who
is
it
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Venn
,
''
said
Thomasin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
have
asked
him
to
come
in
,
I
think
,
Tamsie
.
He
has
been
*NL*
very
kind
to
you
first
and
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
now
,
''
she
said
;
and
,
acting
on
the
impulse
,
went
through
the
*NL*
wicket
to
where
Venn
stood
under
the
Maypole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Mr.
Venn
,
I
think
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
started
as
if
he
had
not
seen
her
--
artful
man
that
he
was
--
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
that
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
you
dancing
this
evening
,
and
you
had
the
very
best
of
*NL*
the
girls
for
your
partners
.
Is
it
that
you
wo
n't
come
in
because
you
*NL*
wish
to
stand
here
,
and
think
over
the
past
hours
of
enjoyment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
partly
it
,
''
said
Mr.
Venn
,
with
ostentatious
sentiment
.
*NL*
``
But
the
main
reason
why
I
am
biding
here
like
this
is
that
I
want
to
*NL*
wait
till
the
moon
rises
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
how
pretty
the
Maypole
looks
in
the
moonlight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
To
look
for
a
glove
that
was
dropped
by
one
of
the
maidens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
was
speechless
with
surprise
.
That
a
man
who
had
to
walk
*NL*
some
four
or
five
miles
to
his
home
should
wait
here
for
such
a
reason
*NL*
pointed
to
only
one
conclusion
:
the
man
must
be
amazingly
interested
*NL*
in
that
glove
's
owner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
dancing
with
her
,
Diggory
?
''
she
asked
,
in
a
voice
which
*NL*
revealed
that
he
had
made
himself
considerably
more
interesting
to
her
*NL*
by
this
disclosure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
not
come
in
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
tonight
,
thank
you
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
lend
you
a
lantern
to
look
for
the
young
person
's
glove
,
Mr.
*NL*
Venn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
;
it
is
not
necessary
,
Mrs.
Wildeve
,
thank
you
.
The
moon
will
*NL*
rise
in
a
few
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
went
back
to
the
porch
.
``
Is
he
coming
in
?
''
said
Clym
,
who
*NL*
had
been
waiting
where
she
had
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
rather
not
tonight
,
''
she
said
,
and
then
passed
by
him
into
*NL*
the
house
;
whereupon
Clym
too
retired
to
his
own
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Clym
was
gone
Thomasin
crept
upstairs
in
the
dark
,
and
,
just
*NL*
listening
by
the
cot
,
to
assure
herself
that
the
child
was
asleep
,
she
*NL*
went
to
the
window
,
gently
lifted
the
corner
of
the
white
curtain
,
*NL*
and
looked
out
.
Venn
was
still
there
.
She
watched
the
growth
of
*NL*
the
faint
radiance
appearing
in
the
sky
by
the
eastern
hill
,
till
*NL*
presently
the
edge
of
the
moon
burst
upwards
and
flooded
the
valley
*NL*
with
light
.
Diggory
's
form
was
now
distinct
on
the
green
;
he
was
*NL*
moving
about
in
a
bowed
attitude
,
evidently
scanning
the
grass
for
the
*NL*
precious
missing
article
,
walking
in
zigzags
right
and
left
till
he
*NL*
should
have
passed
over
every
foot
of
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
ridiculous
!
''
Thomasin
murmured
to
herself
,
in
a
tone
which
*NL*
was
intended
to
be
satirical
.
``
To
think
that
a
man
should
be
so
silly
*NL*
as
to
go
mooning
about
like
that
for
a
girl
's
glove
!
A
respectable
*NL*
dairyman
,
too
,
and
a
man
of
money
as
he
is
now
.
What
a
pity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Venn
appeared
to
find
it
;
whereupon
he
stood
up
and
raised
*NL*
it
to
his
lips
.
Then
placing
it
in
his
breast-pocket
--
the
nearest
*NL*
receptacle
to
a
man
's
heart
permitted
by
modern
raiment
--
he
ascended
*NL*
the
valley
in
a
mathematically
direct
line
towards
his
distant
home
in
*NL*
the
meadows
.

*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
Walks
in
a
Green
Place
by
the
Roman
Road
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
saw
little
of
Thomasin
for
several
days
after
this
;
and
when
they
*NL*
met
she
was
more
silent
than
usual
.
At
length
he
asked
her
what
she
*NL*
was
thinking
of
so
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thoroughly
perplexed
,
''
she
said
candidly
.
``
I
can
not
for
my
life
*NL*
think
who
it
is
that
Diggory
Venn
is
so
much
in
love
with
.
None
of
*NL*
the
girls
at
the
Maypole
were
good
enough
for
him
,
and
yet
she
must
*NL*
have
been
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
tried
to
imagine
Venn
's
choice
for
a
moment
;
but
ceasing
to
be
*NL*
interested
in
the
question
he
went
on
again
with
his
gardening
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
clearing
up
of
the
mystery
was
granted
her
for
some
time
.
But
one
*NL*
afternoon
Thomasin
was
upstairs
getting
ready
for
a
walk
,
when
she
had
*NL*
occasion
to
come
to
the
landing
and
call
``
Rachel
.
''
Rachel
was
a
girl
*NL*
about
thirteen
,
who
carried
the
baby
out
for
airings
;
and
she
came
*NL*
upstairs
at
the
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
one
of
my
last
new
gloves
about
the
house
,
Rachel
?
''
*NL*
inquired
Thomasin
.
``
It
is
the
fellow
to
this
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rachel
did
not
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
answer
?
''
said
her
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
is
lost
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lost
?
Who
lost
it
?
I
have
never
worn
them
but
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rachel
appeared
as
one
dreadfully
troubled
,
and
at
last
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
``
Please
,
ma'am
,
on
the
day
of
the
Maypole
I
had
none
to
wear
,
and
I
*NL*
seed
yours
on
the
table
,
and
I
thought
I
would
borrow
'em
.
I
did
not
*NL*
mean
to
hurt
'em
at
all
,
but
one
of
them
got
lost
.
Somebody
gave
me
*NL*
some
money
to
buy
another
pair
for
you
,
but
I
have
not
been
able
to
*NL*
go
anywhere
to
get
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
somebody
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Venn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
know
it
was
my
glove
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
told
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
was
so
surprised
by
the
explanation
that
she
quite
forgot
*NL*
to
lecture
the
girl
,
who
glided
silently
away
.
Thomasin
did
not
move
*NL*
further
than
to
turn
her
eyes
upon
the
grass-plat
where
the
Maypole
*NL*
had
stood
.
She
remained
thinking
,
then
said
to
herself
that
she
*NL*
would
not
go
out
that
afternoon
,
but
would
work
hard
at
the
baby
's
*NL*
unfinished
lovely
plaid
frock
,
cut
on
the
cross
in
the
newest
fashion
.
*NL*
How
she
managed
to
work
hard
,
and
yet
do
no
more
than
she
had
done
at
*NL*
the
end
of
two
hours
,
would
have
been
a
mystery
to
anyone
not
aware
*NL*
that
the
recent
incident
was
of
a
kind
likely
to
divert
her
industry
*NL*
from
a
manual
to
a
mental
channel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
she
went
her
ways
as
usual
,
and
continued
her
custom
of
*NL*
walking
in
the
heath
with
no
other
companion
than
little
Eustacia
,
now
*NL*
of
the
age
when
it
is
a
matter
of
doubt
with
such
characters
whether
*NL*
they
are
intended
to
walk
through
the
world
on
their
hands
or
on
their
*NL*
feet
;
so
that
they
get
into
painful
complications
by
trying
both
.
It
*NL*
was
very
pleasant
to
Thomasin
,
when
she
had
carried
the
child
to
some
*NL*
lonely
place
,
to
give
her
a
little
private
practice
on
the
green
turf
*NL*
and
shepherd
's
-
thyme
,
which
formed
a
soft
mat
to
fall
headlong
upon
*NL*
when
equilibrium
was
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
,
when
engaged
in
this
system
of
training
,
and
stooping
to
remove
*NL*
bits
of
stick
,
fern-stalks
,
and
other
such
fragments
from
the
child
's
*NL*
path
,
that
the
journey
might
not
be
brought
to
an
untimely
end
by
some
*NL*
insuperable
barrier
a
quarter
of
an
inch
high
,
she
was
alarmed
by
*NL*
discovering
that
a
man
on
horseback
was
almost
close
beside
her
,
the
*NL*
soft
natural
carpet
having
muffled
the
horse
's
tread
.
The
rider
,
who
*NL*
was
Venn
,
waved
his
hat
in
the
air
and
bowed
gallantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Diggory
,
give
me
my
glove
,
''
said
Thomasin
,
whose
manner
it
was
under
*NL*
any
circumstances
to
plunge
into
the
midst
of
a
subject
which
*NL*
engrossed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Venn
immediately
dismounted
,
put
his
hand
in
his
breastpocket
,
and
*NL*
handed
the
glove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
It
was
very
good
of
you
to
take
care
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
.
I
was
quite
glad
to
find
you
had
it
.
Everybody
gets
so
*NL*
indifferent
that
I
was
surprised
to
know
you
thought
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
remembered
what
I
was
once
you
would
n't
have
been
*NL*
surprised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
no
,
''
she
said
quickly
.
``
But
men
of
your
character
are
mostly
so
*NL*
independent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
my
character
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
exactly
know
,
''
said
Thomasin
simply
,
``
except
it
is
to
cover
*NL*
up
your
feelings
under
a
practical
manner
,
and
only
to
show
them
when
*NL*
you
are
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
do
you
know
that
?
''
said
Venn
strategically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
said
she
,
stopping
to
put
the
little
girl
,
who
had
managed
*NL*
to
get
herself
upside
down
,
right
end
up
again
,
``
because
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
judge
by
folks
in
general
,
''
said
Venn
.
``
Still
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
much
what
feelings
are
now-a-days
.
I
have
got
so
mixed
up
with
*NL*
business
of
one
sort
and
t
`
other
that
my
soft
sentiments
are
gone
off
*NL*
in
vapour
like
.
Yes
,
I
am
given
up
body
and
soul
to
the
making
of
*NL*
money
.
Money
is
all
my
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Diggory
,
how
wicked
!
''
said
Thomasin
reproachfully
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
him
in
exact
balance
between
taking
his
words
seriously
and
judging
*NL*
them
as
said
to
tease
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
't
is
rather
a
rum
course
,
''
said
Venn
,
in
the
bland
tone
of
one
*NL*
comfortably
resigned
to
sins
he
could
no
longer
overcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
who
used
to
be
so
nice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
an
argument
I
rather
like
,
because
what
a
man
has
once
*NL*
been
he
may
be
again
.
''
Thomasin
blushed
.
``
Except
that
it
is
rather
*NL*
harder
now
,
''
Venn
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
be
richer
than
you
were
at
that
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
--
not
much
.
I
have
made
it
nearly
all
over
to
the
baby
,
as
it
*NL*
was
my
duty
to
do
,
except
just
enough
to
live
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
rather
glad
of
that
,
''
said
Venn
softly
,
and
regarding
her
from
*NL*
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
``
for
it
makes
it
easier
for
us
to
be
friendly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
blushed
again
,
and
,
when
a
few
more
words
had
been
said
of
a
*NL*
not
unpleasing
kind
,
Venn
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
had
passed
in
a
hollow
of
the
heath
near
the
old
*NL*
Roman
road
,
a
place
much
frequented
by
Thomasin
.
And
it
might
have
*NL*
been
observed
that
she
did
not
in
future
walk
that
way
less
often
from
*NL*
having
met
Venn
there
now
.
Whether
or
not
Venn
abstained
from
riding
*NL*
thither
because
he
had
met
Thomasin
in
the
same
place
might
easily
*NL*
have
been
guessed
from
her
proceedings
about
two
months
later
in
the
*NL*
same
year
.

The
Serious
Discourse
of
Clym
with
His
Cousin
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
this
period
Yeobright
had
more
or
less
pondered
on
his
duty
*NL*
to
his
cousin
Thomasin
.
He
could
not
help
feeling
that
it
would
be
a
*NL*
pitiful
waste
of
sweet
material
if
the
tender-natured
thing
should
be
*NL*
doomed
from
this
early
stage
of
her
life
onwards
to
dribble
away
her
*NL*
winsome
qualities
on
lonely
gorse
and
fern
.
But
he
felt
this
as
an
*NL*
economist
merely
,
and
not
as
a
lover
.
His
passion
for
Eustacia
had
*NL*
been
a
sort
of
conserve
of
his
whole
life
,
and
he
had
nothing
more
of
*NL*
that
supreme
quality
left
to
bestow
.
So
far
the
obvious
thing
was
not
*NL*
to
entertain
any
idea
of
marriage
with
Thomasin
,
even
to
oblige
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
not
all
.
Years
ago
there
had
been
in
his
mother
's
mind
*NL*
a
great
fancy
about
Thomasin
and
himself
.
It
had
not
positively
*NL*
amounted
to
a
desire
,
but
it
had
always
been
a
favourite
dream
.
That
*NL*
they
should
be
man
and
wife
in
good
time
,
if
the
happiness
of
neither
*NL*
were
endangered
thereby
,
was
the
fancy
in
question
.
So
that
what
*NL*
course
save
one
was
there
now
left
for
any
son
who
reverenced
his
*NL*
mother
's
memory
as
Yeobright
did
?
It
is
an
unfortunate
fact
that
any
*NL*
particular
whim
of
parents
,
which
might
have
been
dispersed
by
half
*NL*
an
hour
's
conversation
during
their
lives
,
becomes
sublimated
by
*NL*
their
deaths
into
a
fiat
the
most
absolute
,
with
such
results
to
*NL*
conscientious
children
as
those
parents
,
had
they
lived
,
would
have
*NL*
been
the
first
to
decry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
only
Yeobright
's
own
future
been
involved
he
would
have
proposed
*NL*
to
Thomasin
with
a
ready
heart
.
He
had
nothing
to
lose
by
carrying
*NL*
out
a
dead
mother
's
hope
.
But
he
dreaded
to
contemplate
Thomasin
*NL*
wedded
to
the
mere
corpse
of
a
lover
that
he
now
felt
himself
to
be
.
*NL*
He
had
but
three
activities
alive
in
him
.
One
was
his
almost
daily
*NL*
walk
to
the
little
graveyard
wherein
his
mother
lay
;
another
,
his
*NL*
just
as
frequent
visits
by
night
to
the
more
distant
enclosure
,
which
*NL*
numbered
his
Eustacia
among
its
dead
;
the
third
was
self-preparation
*NL*
for
a
vocation
which
alone
seemed
likely
to
satisfy
his
cravings
--
that
*NL*
of
an
itinerant
preacher
of
the
eleventh
commandment
.
It
was
*NL*
difficult
to
believe
that
Thomasin
would
be
cheered
by
a
husband
with
*NL*
such
tendencies
as
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
resolved
to
ask
her
,
and
let
her
decide
for
herself
.
It
was
*NL*
even
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
doing
his
duty
that
he
went
downstairs
*NL*
to
her
one
evening
for
this
purpose
,
when
the
sun
was
printing
on
the
*NL*
valley
the
same
long
shadow
of
the
housetop
that
he
had
seen
lying
*NL*
there
times
out
of
number
while
his
mother
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thomasin
was
not
in
her
room
,
and
he
found
her
in
the
front
garden
.
*NL*
``
I
have
long
been
wanting
,
Thomasin
,
''
he
began
,
``
to
say
something
*NL*
about
a
matter
that
concerns
both
our
futures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
going
to
say
it
now
?
''
she
remarked
quickly
,
colouring
as
*NL*
she
met
his
gaze
.
``
Do
stop
a
minute
,
Clym
,
and
let
me
speak
first
,
*NL*
for
oddly
enough
,
I
have
been
wanting
to
say
something
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
say
on
,
Tamsie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
nobody
can
overhear
us
?
''
she
went
on
,
casting
her
eyes
*NL*
around
and
lowering
her
voice
.
``
Well
,
first
you
will
promise
me
*NL*
this
--
that
you
wo
n't
be
angry
and
call
me
anything
harsh
if
you
*NL*
disagree
with
what
I
propose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
promised
,
and
she
continued
:
``
What
I
want
is
your
advice
,
*NL*
for
you
are
my
relation
--
I
mean
,
a
sort
of
guardian
to
me
--
are
n't
you
,
*NL*
Clym
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
I
suppose
I
am
;
a
sort
of
guardian
.
In
fact
,
I
am
,
of
*NL*
course
,
''
he
said
,
altogether
perplexed
as
to
her
drift
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thinking
of
marrying
,
''
she
then
observed
blandly
.
``
But
I
shall
*NL*
not
marry
unless
you
assure
me
that
you
approve
of
such
a
step
.
Why
*NL*
do
n't
you
speak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
taken
rather
by
surprise
.
But
,
nevertheless
,
I
am
very
glad
*NL*
to
hear
such
news
.
I
shall
approve
,
of
course
,
dear
Tamsie
.
Who
can
*NL*
it
be
?
I
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
guess
.
No
I
am
not
--
't
is
the
old
*NL*
doctor
!
--
not
that
I
mean
to
call
him
old
,
for
he
is
not
very
old
after
*NL*
all
.
Ah
--
I
noticed
when
he
attended
you
last
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
she
said
hastily
.
''
'T
is
Mr.
Venn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
's
face
suddenly
became
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
now
,
you
do
n't
like
him
,
and
I
wish
I
had
n't
mentioned
him
!
''
*NL*
she
exclaimed
almost
petulantly
.
``
And
I
should
n't
have
done
it
,
*NL*
either
,
only
he
keeps
on
bothering
me
so
till
I
do
n't
know
what
to
*NL*
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
looked
at
the
heath
.
``
I
like
Venn
well
enough
,
''
he
answered
at
*NL*
last
.
``
He
is
a
very
honest
and
at
the
same
time
astute
man
.
He
is
*NL*
clever
too
,
as
is
proved
by
his
having
got
you
to
favour
him
.
But
*NL*
really
,
Thomasin
,
he
is
not
quite
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentleman
enough
for
me
?
That
is
just
what
I
feel
.
I
am
sorry
now
*NL*
that
I
asked
you
,
and
I
wo
n't
think
any
more
of
him
.
At
the
same
time
*NL*
I
must
marry
him
if
I
marry
anybody
--
that
I
WILL
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
that
,
''
said
Clym
,
carefully
concealing
every
clue
to
his
*NL*
own
interrupted
intention
,
which
she
plainly
had
not
guessed
.
``
You
*NL*
might
marry
a
professional
man
,
or
somebody
of
that
sort
,
by
going
*NL*
into
the
town
to
live
and
forming
acquaintances
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
fit
for
town
life
--
so
very
rural
and
silly
as
I
always
have
*NL*
been
.
Do
not
you
yourself
notice
my
countrified
ways
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
I
came
home
from
Paris
I
did
,
a
little
;
but
I
do
n't
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
because
you
have
got
countrified
too
.
O
,
I
could
n't
live
in
a
*NL*
street
for
the
world
!
Egdon
is
a
ridiculous
old
place
;
but
I
have
got
*NL*
used
to
it
,
and
I
could
n't
be
happy
anywhere
else
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
could
I
,
''
said
Clym
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
could
you
say
that
I
should
marry
some
town
man
?
I
am
sure
,
*NL*
say
what
you
will
,
that
I
must
marry
Diggory
,
if
I
marry
at
all
.
He
*NL*
has
been
kinder
to
me
than
anybody
else
,
and
has
helped
me
in
many
*NL*
ways
that
I
do
n't
know
of
!
''
Thomasin
almost
pouted
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
has
,
''
said
Clym
in
a
neutral
tone
.
``
Well
,
I
wish
with
all
my
*NL*
heart
that
I
could
say
,
marry
him
.
But
I
can
not
forget
what
my
mother
*NL*
thought
on
that
matter
,
and
it
goes
rather
against
me
not
to
respect
*NL*
her
opinion
.
There
is
too
much
reason
why
we
should
do
the
little
we
*NL*
can
to
respect
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
''
sighed
Thomasin
.
``
I
will
say
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
not
bound
to
obey
my
wishes
.
I
merely
say
what
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
--
I
do
n't
want
to
be
rebellious
in
that
way
,
''
she
said
sadly
.
``
I
*NL*
had
no
business
to
think
of
him
--
I
ought
to
have
thought
of
my
family
.
*NL*
What
dreadfully
bad
impulses
there
are
in
me
!
''
Her
lips
trembled
,
and
*NL*
she
turned
away
to
hide
a
tear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
,
though
vexed
at
what
seemed
her
unaccountable
taste
,
was
in
a
*NL*
measure
relieved
to
find
that
at
any
rate
the
marriage
question
in
*NL*
relation
to
himself
was
shelved
.
Through
several
succeeding
days
*NL*
he
saw
her
at
different
times
from
the
window
of
his
room
moping
*NL*
disconsolately
about
the
garden
.
He
was
half
angry
with
her
for
*NL*
choosing
Venn
;
then
he
was
grieved
at
having
put
himself
in
the
way
*NL*
of
Venn
's
happiness
,
who
was
,
after
all
,
as
honest
and
persevering
a
*NL*
young
fellow
as
any
on
Egdon
,
since
he
had
turned
over
a
new
leaf
.
*NL*
In
short
,
Clym
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
next
they
met
she
said
abruptly
,
``
He
is
much
more
respectable
*NL*
now
than
he
was
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
O
yes
--
Diggory
Venn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
only
objected
because
he
was
a
reddleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Thomasin
,
perhaps
I
do
n't
know
all
the
particulars
of
my
*NL*
mother
's
wish
.
So
you
had
better
use
your
own
discretion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
always
feel
that
I
slighted
your
mother
's
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
will
not
.
I
shall
think
you
are
convinced
that
,
had
she
seen
*NL*
Diggory
in
his
present
position
,
she
would
have
considered
him
a
*NL*
fitting
husband
for
you
.
Now
,
that
's
my
real
feeling
.
Do
n't
consult
*NL*
me
any
more
,
but
do
as
you
like
,
Thomasin
.
I
shall
be
content
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
to
be
supposed
that
Thomasin
was
convinced
;
for
a
few
days
after
*NL*
this
,
when
Clym
strayed
into
a
part
of
the
heath
that
he
had
not
*NL*
lately
visited
,
Humphrey
,
who
was
at
work
there
,
said
to
him
,
``
I
am
*NL*
glad
to
see
that
Mrs.
Wildeve
and
Venn
have
made
it
up
again
,
*NL*
seemingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
they
?
''
said
Clym
abstractedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

and
he
do
contrive
to
stumble
upon
her
whenever
she
walks
out

on
fine
days
with

chiel
.
But
,
Mr.
Yeobright
,
I
ca
n't
help
feeling
*NL*
that
your
cousin
ought
to
have
married
you
.
'T
is
a
pity
to
make
two
*NL*
chimley-corners
where
there
need
be
only
one

You
could
get
her
away
*NL*
from
him
now

is
my
belief

you
were
only
to
set
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
have
the
conscience

marry
after
having
driven
two
*NL*
women
to
their
deaths

Do
n't
think
such
a
thing

Humphrey
.
After
my
*NL*
experience
I
should
consider
it
too
much
of
a
burlesque
to
go
to
*NL*
church
and
take
a

In

Job

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Yeobright

As
Clym
descended
into
the
valley
Thomasin
came
down
by
the
other

path

and
met
him
at
the
gate

``
What

looking

She
scrutinized
his

Cheerfulness
Again
Asserts
Itself
at
Blooms-End
,
*NL*
and
Clym
Finds
His
Vocation
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anybody
who
had
passed
through
Blooms-End
about
eleven
o'clock
on
the
*NL*
morning
fixed
for
the
wedding
would
have
found
that
,
while
Yeobright
's
*NL*
house
was
comparatively
quiet
,
sounds
denoting
great
activity
came
*NL*
from
the
dwelling
of
his
nearest
neighbour
,
Timothy
Fairway
.
It
was
*NL*
chiefly
a
noise
of
feet
,
briskly
crunching
hither
and
thither
over
*NL*
the
sanded
floor
within
.
One
man
only
was
visible
outside
,
and
he
*NL*
seemed
to
be
later
at
an
appointment
than
he
had
intended
to
be
,
for
*NL*
he
hastened
up
to
the
door
,
lifted
the
latch
,
and
walked
in
without
*NL*
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
within
was
not
quite
the
customary
one
.
Standing
about
the
*NL*
room
was
the
little
knot
of
men
who
formed
the
chief
part
of
the
*NL*
Egdon
coterie
,
there
being
present
Fairway
himself
,
Grandfer
Cantle
,
*NL*
Humphrey
,
Christian
,
and
one
or
two
turf-cutters
.
It
was
a
warm
day
,
*NL*
and
the
men
were
as
a
matter
of
course
in
their
shirtsleeves
,
except
*NL*
Christian
,
who
had
always
a
nervous
fear
of
parting
with
a
scrap
of
*NL*
his
clothing
when
in
anybody
's
house
but
his
own
.
Across
the
stout
oak
*NL*
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
thrown
a
mass
of
striped
linen
,
*NL*
which
Grandfer
Cantle
held
down
on
one
side
,
and
Humphrey
on
the
*NL*
other
,
while
Fairway
rubbed
its
surface
with
a
yellow
lump
,
his
face
*NL*
being
damp
and
creased
with
the
effort
of
the
labour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waxing
a
bed-tick
,
souls
?
''
said
the
newcomer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Sam
,
''
said
Grandfer
Cantle
,
as
a
man
too
busy
to
waste
words
.
*NL*
``
Shall
I
stretch
this
corner
a
shade
tighter
,
Timothy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fairway
replied
,
and
the
waxing
went
on
with
unabated
vigour
.
''
'T
is
*NL*
going
to
be
a
good
bed
,
by
the
look
o
`
t
,
''
continued
Sam
,
after
an
*NL*
interval
of
silence
.
``
Who
may
it
be
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
present
for
the
new
folks
that
's
going
to
set
up
*NL*
housekeeping
,
''
said
Christian
,
who
stood
helpless
and
overcome
by
the
*NL*
majesty
of
the
proceedings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
to
be
sure
;
and
a
valuable
one
,
'
a
b
`
lieve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beds
be
dear
to
fokes
that
do
n't
keep
geese
,
bai
n't
they
,
Mister
*NL*
Fairway
?
''
said
Christian
,
as
to
an
omniscient
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
furze-dealer
,
standing
up
,
giving
his
forehead
a
*NL*
thorough
mopping
,
and
handing
the
beeswax
to
Humphrey
,
who
succeeded
*NL*
at
the
rubbing
forthwith
.
``
Not
that
this
couple
be
in
want
of
one
,
but
*NL*
't
was
well
to
show
'em
a
bit
of
friendliness
at
this
great
racketing
*NL*
vagary
of
their
lives
.
I
set
up
both
my
own
daughters
in
one
when
*NL*
they
was
married
,
and
there
have
been
feathers
enough
for
another
in
*NL*
the
house
the
last
twelve
months
.
Now
then
,
neighbours
,
I
think
we
*NL*
have
laid
on
enough
wax
.
Grandfer
Cantle
,
you
turn
the
tick
the
right
*NL*
way
outwards
,
and
then
I
'll
begin
to
shake
in
the
feathers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
bed
was
in
proper
trim
Fairway
and
Christian
brought
forward
*NL*
vast
paper
bags
,
stuffed
to
the
full
,
but
light
as
balloons
,
and
began
*NL*
to
turn
the
contents
of
each
into
the
receptacle
just
prepared
.
As
*NL*
bag
after
bag
was
emptied
,
airy
tufts
of
down
and
feathers
floated
*NL*
about
the
room
in
increasing
quantity
till
,
through
a
mishap
of
*NL*
Christian
's
,
who
shook
the
contents
of
one
bag
outside
the
tick
,
*NL*
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
became
dense
with
gigantic
flakes
,
which
*NL*
descended
upon
the
workers
like
a
windless
snowstorm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
such
a
clumsy
chap
as
you
,
Christian
,
''
said
Grandfer
*NL*
Cantle
severely
.
``
You
might
have
been
the
son
of
a
man
that
's
never
*NL*
been
outside
Blooms-End
in
his
life
for
all
the
wit
you
have
.
Really
*NL*
all
the
soldiering
and
smartness
in
the
world
in
the
father
seems
to
*NL*
count
for
nothing
in
forming
the
nater
of
the
son
.
As
far
as
that
*NL*
chiel
Christian
is
concerned
I
might
as
well
have
stayed
at
home
and
*NL*
seed
nothing
,
like
all
the
rest
of
ye
here
.
Though
,
as
far
as
myself
*NL*
is
concerned

a
dashing
spirit
has
counted

to
be
sure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ye
let
me
down
so

I
feel
no
bigger

*NL*
``
Come

''
said
Fairway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
should
try
more
,
''
echoed
the
Grandfer
with
insistence
,
as
if
*NL*
he
had
been
the
first
to
make
the
suggestion
.
``
In
common
conscience
*NL*
every
man
ought
either
to
marry

go
for
a
soldier

'T
is
a
scandal
*NL*
to
the
nation
to
do
neither
one
nor
t

other
.
I
did
both
,
thank
God
!
*NL*
Neither
to
raise
men
nor
to
lay
'em
low

that
shows
a
poor
do-nothing

spirit
indeed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
had
the
nerve
to
stand
fire
,
''
faltered
Christian
.
``
But
as
to
*NL*
marrying

I
own
I
've
asked
here
and
there
,
though
without
much
fruit
*NL*
from
it
.
Yes
,
there
's
some
house
or
other
that
might
have
had
a
*NL*
man
for
a
master
--
such
as
he
is
--
that
's
now
ruled
by
a
woman
alone

*NL*
Still
it
might
have
been
awkward
if
I
had
found
her
;
for
,
d'ye
see
,
*NL*
neighbours
,
there
'd
have
been
nobody
left
at
home
to
keep
down
*NL*
father
's
spirits
to
the
decent
pitch
that
becomes
a
old
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
've
your
work
cut
out
to
do
that
,
my
son

''
said
Grandfer
*NL*
Cantle
smartly
.
``
I
wish
that
the
dread

strong

I

tomorrow

But
seventy-one

And
the
old
man
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
be
mournful

Grandfer

said
Fairway
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Begad

said
Granfer
*NL*
Cantle
in
an
encouraged
voice
,
and
starting
round
briskly
.
``
I
'll
go
*NL*
to
'em
tonight

'T
is

they

*NL*
*NL*

`
Twould

Really

I
come

I
have

turned
my
tongue
in

the
shape
of
a
real

song
since
Old
Midsummer
night
,
when
we
had
the
`
Barley
Mow

at
the
*NL*
Woman
;
and
't
is
a
pity
to
neglect
your
strong
point
where
there
's
few
*NL*
that
have
the
compass
for
such
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
't
is
,
so
't
is
,
''
said
Fairway
.
``
Now
gie
the
bed
a
shake
down
.
*NL*
We
've
put
in
seventy
pound
of
best
feathers
,
and
I
think
that
's
as
*NL*
many
as
the
tick
will
fairly
hold
.
A
bit
and
a
drap
would
n't
be
amiss
*NL*
now
,
I
reckon

maul
down
the
victuals

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
to
a
lunch
in
the
midst
of
their
work
,
feathers
around
,
*NL*
above
,
and
below
them
;
the
original
owners
of
which
occasionally
came
*NL*
to
the
open
door
and
cackled
begrudgingly
at
sight
of
such
a
quantity
*NL*
of
their
old
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul
I
shall
be
chokt
,
''
said
Fairway
when
,
having
extracted
a
*NL*
feather
from
his
mouth
,
he
found
several
others
floating
on
the
mug
as
*NL*
it
was
handed
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
swallered
several
;
and
one
had
a
tolerable
quill
,
''
said
Sam
*NL*
placidly
from
the
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
--
what
's
that
--
wheels
I
hear
coming
?
''
Grandfer
Cantle
exclaimed
,
*NL*
jumping
up
and
hastening
to
the
door
.
``
Why
,
't
is
they
back
again
:
I
*NL*
did
n't
expect
'em
yet
this
half-hour
.
To
be
sure
,
how
quick
marrying
*NL*
can
be
done
when
you
are
in
the
mind
for
`
t
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
it
can
soon
be
DONE
,
''
said
Fairway
,
as
if
something
should
be
*NL*
added
to
make
the
statement
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
arose
and
followed
the
Grandfer
,
and
the
rest
also
went
to
the
*NL*
door
.
In
a
moment
an
open
fly
was
driven
past
,
in
which
sat
Venn
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Venn
,
Yeobright
,
and
a
grand
relative
of
Venn
's
who
had
come
*NL*
from
Budmouth
for
the
occasion
.
The
fly
had
been
hired
at
the
nearest
*NL*
town
,
regardless
of
distance
and
cost
,
there
being
nothing
on
Egdon
*NL*
Heath
,
in
Venn
's
opinion
,
dignified
enough
for
such
an
event
when
such
*NL*
a
woman
as
Thomasin
was
the
bride
;
and
the
church
was
too
remote
for
a
*NL*
walking
bridal-party
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
fly
passed
the
group
which
had
run
out
from
the
homestead
they
*NL*
shouted
``
Hurrah
!
''
and
waved
their
hands
;
feathers
and
down
floating
*NL*
from
their
hair
,
their
sleeves
,
and
the
folds
of
their
garments
at
*NL*
every
motion
,
and
Grandfer
Cantle
's
seals
dancing
merrily
in
the
*NL*
sunlight
as
he
twirled
himself
about
.
The
driver
of
the
fly
turned
*NL*
a
supercilious
gaze
upon
them
;
he
even
treated
the
wedded
pair
*NL*
themselves
with
something
like
condescension
;
for
in
what
other
*NL*
state
than
heathen
could
people
,
rich
or
poor
,
exist
who
were
doomed
*NL*
to
abide
in
such
a
world
's
end
as
Egdon
?
Thomasin
showed
no
such
*NL*
superiority
to
the
group
at
the
door
,
fluttering
her
hand
as
quickly
*NL*
as
a
bird
's
wing
towards
them
,
and
asking
Diggory
,
with
tears
in
her
*NL*
eyes
,
if
they
ought
not
to
alight
and
speak
to
these
kind
neighbours
.
*NL*
Venn
,
however
,
suggested
that
,
as
they
were
all
coming
to
the
house
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
this
was
hardly
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
excitement
the
saluting
party
returned
to
their
occupation
,
*NL*
and
the
stuffing
and
sewing
were
soon
afterwards
finished
,
when
*NL*
Fairway
harnessed
a
horse
,
wrapped
up
the
cumbrous
present
,
and
drove
*NL*
off
with
it
in
the
cart
to
Venn
's
house
at
Stickleford
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
,
having
filled
the
office
at
the
wedding
service
which
*NL*
naturally
fell
to
his
hands
,
and
afterwards
returned
to
the
house
with
*NL*
the
husband
and
wife
,
was
indisposed
to
take
part
in
the
feasting
and
*NL*
dancing
that
wound
up
the
evening
.
Thomasin
was
disappointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
be
there
without
dashing
your
spirits
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
*NL*
I
might
be
too
much
like
the
skull
at
the
banquet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
dear
,
apart
from
that
,
if
you
would
excuse
me
,
I
should
be
*NL*
glad

know
it
seems
unkind
;
but
,
dear
Thomasin
,
I
fear
I
should
not
*NL*
be
happy
in
the
company
--
there
,
that
's
the
truth
of
it
.
I
shall
*NL*
always
be
coming
to
see
you
at
your
new
home
,
you
know
,
so
that
my
*NL*
absence
now
will
not
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
give
in
.
Do
whatever
will
be
most
comfortable
to
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clym
retired
to
his
lodging
at
the
housetop
much
relieved
,
and
*NL*
occupied
himself
during
the
afternoon
in
noting
down
the
heads
of
a
*NL*
sermon
,
with
which
he
intended
to
initiate
all
that
really
seemed
*NL*
practicable
of
the
scheme
that
had
originally
brought
him
hither
,
and
*NL*
that
he
had
so
long
kept
in
view
under
various
modifications
,
and
*NL*
through
evil
and
good
report
.
He
had
tested
and
weighed
his
*NL*
convictions
again
and
again
,
and
saw
no
reason
to
alter
them
,
though
*NL*
he
had
considerably
lessened
his
plan
.
His
eyesight
,
by
long
*NL*
humouring
in
his
native
air
,
had
grown
stronger
,
but
not
sufficiently
*NL*
strong
to
warrant
his
attempting
his
extensive
educational
project
.
*NL*
Yet
he
did
not
repine
:
there
was
still
more
than
enough
of
an
*NL*
unambitious
sort
to
tax
all
his
energies
and
occupy
all
his
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
drew
on
,
and
sounds
of
life
and
movement
in
the
lower
part
of
*NL*
the
domicile
became
more
pronounced
,
the
gate
in
the
palings
clicking
*NL*
incessantly
.
The
party
was
to
be
an
early
one
,
and
all
the
guests
*NL*
were
assembled
long
before
it
was
dark
.
Yeobright
went
down
the
back
*NL*
staircase
and
into
the
heath
by
another
path
than
that
in
front
,
*NL*
intending
to
walk
in
the
open
air
till
the
party
was
over
,
when
he
*NL*
would
return
to
wish
Thomasin
and
her
husband
good-bye
as
they
*NL*
departed
.
His
steps
were
insensibly
bent
towards
Mistover
by
the
path
*NL*
that
he
had
followed
on
that
terrible
morning
when
he
learnt
the
*NL*
strange
news
from
Susan
's
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
turn
aside
to
the
cottage
,
but
pushed
on
to
an
eminence
,
*NL*
whence
he
could
see
over
the
whole
quarter
that
had
once
been
*NL*
Eustacia
's
home
.
While
he
stood
observing
the
darkening
scene
*NL*
somebody
came
up
.
Clym
,
seeing
him
but
dimly
,
would
have
let
him
pass
*NL*
silently
,
had
not
the
pedestrian
,
who
was
Charley
,
recognized
the
*NL*
young
man
and
spoken
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charley
,
I
have
not
seen
you
for
a
length
of
time
,
''
said
Yeobright
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
often
walk
this
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
the
lad
replied
.
``
I
do
n't
often
come
outside
the
bank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
not
at
the
Maypole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Charley
,
in
the
same
listless
tone
.
``
I
do
n't
care
for
that
*NL*
sort
of
thing
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
rather
liked
Miss
Eustacia
,
did
n't
you
?
''
Yeobright
gently
asked
.
*NL*
Eustacia
had
frequently
told
him
of
Charley
's
romantic
attachment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
much
.
Ah
,
I
wish
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
Mr.
Yeobright
,
you
could
give
me
something
to
keep
that
once
*NL*
belonged
to
her
--
if
you
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
.
It
will
give
me
very
great
pleasure
,
*NL*
Charley
.
Let
me
think
what
I
have
of
hers
that
you
would
like
.
But
*NL*
come
with
me
to
the
house
,
and
I
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
towards
Blooms-End
together
.
When
they
reached
the
front
*NL*
it
was
dark
,
and
the
shutters
were
closed
,
so
that
nothing
of
the
*NL*
interior
could
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
round
this
way
,
''
said
Clym
.
``
My
entrance
is
at
the
back
for
the
*NL*
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
went
round
and
ascended
the
crooked
stair
in
darkness
till
*NL*
Clym
's
sitting-room
on
the
upper
floor
was
reached
,
where
he
lit
a
*NL*
candle
,
Charley
entering
gently
behind
.
Yeobright
searched
his
desk
,
*NL*
and
taking
out
a
sheet
of
tissue-paper
unfolded
from
it
two
or
three
*NL*
undulating
locks
of
raven
hair
,
which
fell
over
the
paper
like
black
*NL*
streams
.
From
these
he
selected
one
,
wrapped
it
up
,
and
gave
it
to
*NL*
the
lad
,
whose
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
.
He
kissed
the
packet
,
put
*NL*
it
in
his
pocket
,
and
said
in
a
voice
of
emotion
,
``
O
,
Mr.
Clym
,
how
*NL*
good
you
are
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
a
little
way
with
you
,
''
said
Clym
.
And
amid
the
noise
of
*NL*
merriment
from
below
they
descended
.
Their
path
to
the
front
led
them
*NL*
close
to
a
little
side-window
,
whence
the
rays
of
candles
streamed
*NL*
across
the
shrubs
.
The
window
,
being
screened
from
general
*NL*
observation
by
the
bushes
,
had
been
left
unblinded
,
so
that
a
person
*NL*
in
this
private
nook
could
see
all
that
was
going
on
within
the
room
*NL*
which
contained
the
wedding-guests
,
except
in
so
far
as
vision
was
*NL*
hindered
by
the
green
antiquity
of
the
panes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charley
,
what
are
they
doing
?
''
said
Clym
.
``
My
sight
is
weaker
again
*NL*
tonight
,
and
the
glass
of
this
window
is
not
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charley
wiped
his
own
eyes
,
which
were
rather
blurred
with
moisture
,
*NL*
and
stepped
closer
to
the
casement
.
``
Mr.
Venn
is
asking
Christian
*NL*
Cantle
to
sing
,
''
he
replied
,
``
and
Christian
is
moving
about
in
his
*NL*
chair
as
if
he
were
much
frightened
at
the
question
,
and
his
father
*NL*
has
struck
up
a
stave
instead
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
can
hear
the
old
man
's
voice
,
''
said
Clym
.
``
So
there
's
to
be
*NL*
no
dancing
,
I
suppose
.
And
is
Thomasin
in
the
room
?
I
see
something
*NL*
moving
in
front
of
the
candles
that
resembles
her
shape
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
She
do
seem
happy
.
She
is
red
in
the
face
,
and
laughing
at
*NL*
something
Fairway
has
said
to
her
.
O
my
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
noise
was
that
?
''
said
Clym
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Venn
is
so
tall
that
he
knocked
his
head
against
the
beam
in
*NL*
gieing
a
skip
as
he
passed
under
.
Mrs.
Venn
has
run
up
quite
*NL*
frightened
and
now
she
's
put
her
hand
to
his
head
to
feel
if
there
's
a
*NL*
lump
.
And
now
they
be
all
laughing
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
any
of
them
seem
to
care
about
my
not
being
there
?
''
Clym
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
a
bit
in
the
world
.
Now
they
are
all
holding
up
their
*NL*
glasses
and
drinking
somebody
's
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
it
is
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
't
is
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Venn
's
,
because
he
is
making
a
hearty
sort
of
*NL*
speech
.
There
--
now
Mrs.
Venn
has
got
up
,
and
is
going
away
to
put
on
*NL*
her
things
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
have
n't
concerned
themselves
about
me
,
and
it
is
quite
*NL*
right
they
should
not
.
It
is
all
as
it
should
be
,
and
Thomasin
at
*NL*
least
is
happy
.
We
will
not
stay
any
longer
now
,
as
they
will
soon
be
*NL*
coming
out
to
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
accompanied
the
lad
into
the
heath
on
his
way
home
,
and
,
returning
*NL*
alone
to
the
house
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
,
found
Venn
and
Thomasin
*NL*
ready
to
start
,
all
the
guests
having
departed
in
his
absence
.
The
*NL*
wedded
pair
took
their
seats
in
the
four-wheeled
dogcart
which
Venn
's
*NL*
head
milker
and
handy
man
had
driven
from
Stickleford
to
fetch
them
*NL*
in
;
little
Eustacia
and
the
nurse
were
packed
securely
upon
the
open
*NL*
flap
behind
;
and
the
milker
,
on
an
ancient
overstepping
pony
,
whose
*NL*
shoes
clashed
like
cymbals
at
every
tread
,
rode
in
the
rear
,
in
the
*NL*
manner
of
a
body-servant
of
the
last
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
leave
you
in
absolute
possession
of
your
own
house
again
,
''
*NL*
said
Thomasin
as
she
bent
down
to
wish
her
cousin
good
night
.
``
It
*NL*
will
be
rather
lonely
for
you
,
Clym
,
after
the
hubbub
we
have
been
*NL*
making
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
that
's
no
inconvenience
,
''
said
Clym
,
smiling
rather
sadly
.
And
*NL*
then
the
party
drove
off
and
vanished
in
the
night
shades
,
and
*NL*
Yeobright
entered
the
house
.
The
ticking
of
the
clock
was
the
only
*NL*
sound
that
greeted
him
,
for
not
a
soul
remained
;
Christian
,
who
acted
*NL*
as
cook
,
valet
,
and
gardener
to
Clym
,
sleeping
at
his
father
's
house
.
*NL*
Yeobright
sat
down
in
one
of
the
vacant
chairs
,
and
remained
in
*NL*
thought
a
long
time
.
His
mother
's
old
chair
was
opposite
;
it
had
been
*NL*
sat
in
that
evening
by
those
who
had
scarcely
remembered
that
it
ever
*NL*
was
hers
.
But
to
Clym
she
was
almost
a
presence
there
,
now
as
always
.
*NL*
Whatever
she
was
in
other
people
's
memories
,
in
his
she
was
the
*NL*
sublime
saint
whose
radiance
even
his
tenderness
for
Eustacia
could
*NL*
not
obscure
.
But
his
heart
was
heavy
;
that
mother
had
NOT
crowned
him
*NL*
in
the
day
of
his
espousals
and
in
the
day
of
the
gladness
of
his
*NL*
heart
.
And
events
had
borne
out
the
accuracy
of
her
judgment
,
and
*NL*
proved
the
devotedness
of
her
care
.
He
should
have
heeded
her
for
*NL*
Eustacia
's
sake
even
more
than
for
his
own
.
``
It
was
all
my
fault
,
''
he
*NL*
whispered
.
``
O
,
my
mother
,
my
mother
!
would
to
God
that
I
could
live
*NL*
my
life
again
,
and
endure
for
you
what
you
endured
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Sunday
after
this
wedding
an
unusual
sight
was
to
be
seen
on
*NL*
Rainbarrow
.
From
a
distance
there
simply
appeared
to
be
a
motionless
*NL*
figure
standing
on
the
top
of
the
tumulus
,
just
as
Eustacia
had
stood
*NL*
on
that
lonely
summit
some
two
years
and
a
half
before
.
But
now
it
*NL*
was
fine
warm
weather
,
with
only
a
summer
breeze
blowing
,
and
early
*NL*
afternoon
instead
of
dull
twilight
.
Those
who
ascended
to
the
*NL*
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
Barrow
perceived
that
the
erect
form
in
*NL*
the
centre
,
piercing
the
sky
,
was
not
really
alone
.
Round
him
upon
*NL*
the
slopes
of
the
Barrow
a
number
of
heathmen
and
women
were
reclining
*NL*
or
sitting
at
their
ease
.
They
listened
to
the
words
of
the
man
in
*NL*
their
midst
,
who
was
preaching
,
while
they
abstractedly
pulled
*NL*
heather
,
stripped
ferns
,
or
tossed
pebbles
down
the
slope
.
This
was
*NL*
the
first
of
a
series
of
moral
lectures
or
Sermons
on
the
Mount
,
which
*NL*
were
to
be
delivered
from
the
same
place
every
Sunday
afternoon
as
*NL*
long
as
the
fine
weather
lasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commanding
elevation
of
Rainbarrow
had
been
chosen
for
two
*NL*
reasons
:
first
,
that
it
occupied
a
central
position
among
the
remote
*NL*
cottages
around
;
secondly
,
that
the
preacher
thereon
could
be
seen
*NL*
from
all
adjacent
points
as
soon
as
he
arrived
at
his
post
,
the
view
*NL*
of
him
being
thus
a
convenient
signal
to
those
stragglers
who
wished
*NL*
to
draw
near
.
The
speaker
was
bareheaded
,
and
the
breeze
at
each
waft
*NL*
gently
lifted
and
lowered
his
hair
,
somewhat
too
thin
for
a
man
of
his
*NL*
years
,
these
still
numbering
less
than
thirty-three
.
He
wore
a
shade
*NL*
over
his
eyes
,
and
his
face
was
pensive
and
lined
;
but
,
though
these
*NL*
bodily
features
were
marked
with
decay
there
was
no
defect
in
the
*NL*
tones
of
his
voice
,
which
were
rich
,
musical
,
and
stirring
.
He
stated
*NL*
that
his
discourses
to
people
were
to
be
sometimes
secular
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
religious
,
but
never
dogmatic
;
and
that
his
texts
would
be
*NL*
taken
from
all
kinds
of
books
.
This
afternoon
the
words
were
as
*NL*
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
And
the
king
rose
up
to
meet
her
,
and
bowed
himself
unto
*NL*
her
,
and
sat
down
on
his
throne
,
and
caused
a
seat
to
be
set
*NL*
for
the
king
's
mother
;
and
she
sat
on
his
right
hand
.
Then
*NL*
she
said
,
I
desire
one
small
petition
of
thee
;
I
pray
thee
*NL*
say
me
not
nay
.
And
the
king
said
unto
her
,
Ask
,
on
,
my
*NL*
mother
:
for
I
will
not
say
thee
nay
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yeobright
had
,
in
fact
,
found
his
vocation
in
the
career
of
an
*NL*
itinerant
open-air
preacher
and
lecturer
on
morally
unimpeachable
*NL*
subjects
;
and
from
this
day
he
laboured
incessantly
in
that
office
,
*NL*
speaking
not
only
in
simple
language
on
Rainbarrow
and
in
the
hamlets
*NL*
round
,
but
in
a
more
cultivated
strain
elsewhere
--
from
the
steps
and
*NL*
porticoes
of
town-halls
,
from
market-crosses
,
from
conduits
,
on
*NL*
esplanades
and
on
wharves
,
from
the
parapets
of
bridges
,
in
barns
and
*NL*
outhouses
,
and
all
other
such
places
in
the
neighbouring
Wessex
towns
*NL*
and
villages
.
He
left
alone
creeds
and
systems
of
philosophy
,
finding
*NL*
enough
and
more
than
enough
to
occupy
his
tongue
in
the
opinions
and
*NL*
actions
common
to
all
good
men
.
Some
believed
him
,
and
some
believed
*NL*
not
;
some
said
that
his
words
were
commonplace
,
others
complained
of
*NL*
his
want
of
theological
doctrine
;
while
others
again
remarked
that
it
*NL*
was
well
enough
for
a
man
to
take
to
preaching
who
could
not
see
to
do
*NL*
anything
else
.
But
everywhere
he
was
kindly
received
,
for
the
story
*NL*
of
his
life
had
become
generally
known
.
