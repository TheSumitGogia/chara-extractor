The
Bertolini

*NL*
``
The
Signora
had
no
business
to
do
it
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
``
no
business
*NL*
at
all
.
She
promised
us
south
rooms
with
a
view
close
together
,
instead
*NL*
of
which
here
are
north
rooms
,
looking
into
a
courtyard
,
and
a
long
way
*NL*
apart
.
Oh
,
Lucy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
Cockney
,
besides
!
''
said
Lucy
,
who
had
been
further
saddened
by
*NL*
the
Signora
's
unexpected
accent
.
``
It
might
be
London
.
''
She
looked
at
the
*NL*
two
rows
of
English
people
who
were
sitting
at
the
table
;
at
the
row
*NL*
of
white
bottles
of
water
and
red
bottles
of
wine
that
ran
between
the
*NL*
English
people
;
at
the
portraits
of
the
late
Queen
and
the
late
Poet
*NL*
Laureate
that
hung
behind
the
English
people
,
heavily
framed
;
at
the
*NL*
notice
of
the
English
church
-LRB-
Rev.
Cuthbert
Eager
,
M.
A.
Oxon
.
-RRB-
,
that
*NL*
was
the
only
other
decoration
of
the
wall
.
``
Charlotte
,
do
n't
you
feel
,
*NL*
too
,
that
we
might
be
in
London
?
I
can
hardly
believe
that
all
kinds
of
*NL*
other
things
are
just
outside
.
I
suppose
it
is
one
's
being
so
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
meat
has
surely
been
used
for
soup
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
laying
*NL*
down
her
fork
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
so
to
see
the
Arno
.
The
rooms
the
Signora
promised
us
in
her
*NL*
letter
would
have
looked
over
the
Arno
.
The
Signora
had
no
business
to
*NL*
do
it
at
all
.
Oh
,
it
is
a
shame
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
nook
does
for
me
,
''
Miss
Bartlett
continued
;
``
but
it
does
seem
hard
*NL*
that
you
should
n't
have
a
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
felt
that
she
had
been
selfish
.
``
Charlotte
,
you
must
n't
spoil
me
:
*NL*
of
course
,
you
must
look
over
the
Arno
,
too
.
I
meant
that
.
The
first
*NL*
vacant
room
in
the
front
--
''
``
You
must
have
it
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
part
*NL*
of
whose
travelling
expenses
were
paid
by
Lucy
's
mother
--
a
piece
of
*NL*
generosity
to
which
she
made
many
a
tactful
allusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
You
must
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
insist
on
it
.
Your
mother
would
never
forgive
me
,
Lucy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
never
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
'
voices
grew
animated
,
and
--
if
the
sad
truth
be
owned
--
a
*NL*
little
peevish
.
They
were
tired
,
and
under
the
guise
of
unselfishness
*NL*
they
wrangled
.
Some
of
their
neighbours
interchanged
glances
,
and
one
*NL*
of
them
--
one
of
the
ill-bred
people
whom
one
does
meet
abroad
--
leant
*NL*
forward
over
the
table
and
actually
intruded
into
their
argument
.
He
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
view
,
I
have
a
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
was
startled
.
Generally
at
a
pension
people
looked
them
*NL*
over
for
a
day
or
two
before
speaking
,
and
often
did
not
find
out
that
*NL*
they
would
``
do
''
till
they
had
gone
.
She
knew
that
the
intruder
was
*NL*
ill-bred
,
even
before
she
glanced
at
him
.
He
was
an
old
man
,
of
heavy
*NL*
build
,
with
a
fair
,
shaven
face
and
large
eyes
.
There
was
something
*NL*
childish
in
those
eyes
,
though
it
was
not
the
childishness
of
senility
.
*NL*
What
exactly
it
was
Miss
Bartlett
did
not
stop
to
consider
,
for
her
*NL*
glance
passed
on
to
his
clothes
.
These
did
not
attract
her
.
He
was
*NL*
probably
trying
to
become
acquainted
with
them
before
they
got
into
the
*NL*
swim
.
So
she
assumed
a
dazed
expression
when
he
spoke
to
her
,
and
then
*NL*
said
:
``
A
view
?
Oh
,
a
view
!
How
delightful
a
view
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
son
,
''
said
the
old
man
;
``
his
name
's
George
.
He
has
a
view
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
repressing
Lucy
,
who
was
about
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
mean
,
''
he
continued
,
``
is
that
you
can
have
our
rooms
,
and
we
'll
*NL*
have
yours
.
We
'll
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
better
class
of
tourist
was
shocked
at
this
,
and
sympathized
with
*NL*
the
new-comers
.
Miss
Bartlett
,
in
reply
,
opened
her
mouth
as
little
*NL*
as
possible
,
and
said
``
Thank
you
very
much
indeed
;
that
is
out
of
the
*NL*
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
said
the
old
man
,
with
both
fists
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
,
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
we
do
n't
like
to
take
--
''
began
Lucy
.
Her
cousin
again
*NL*
repressed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
''
he
persisted
.
``
Women
like
looking
at
a
view
;
men
do
n't
.
''
And
*NL*
he
thumped
with
his
fists
like
a
naughty
child
,
and
turned
to
his
son
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
George
,
persuade
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
obvious
they
should
have
the
rooms
,
''
said
the
son
.
``
There
's
*NL*
nothing
else
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
look
at
the
ladies
as
he
spoke
,
but
his
voice
was
perplexed
*NL*
and
sorrowful
.
Lucy
,
too
,
was
perplexed
;
but
she
saw
that
they
were
in
*NL*
for
what
is
known
as
``
quite
a
scene
,
''
and
she
had
an
odd
feeling
that
*NL*
whenever
these
ill-bred
tourists
spoke
the
contest
widened
and
deepened
*NL*
till
it
dealt
,
not
with
rooms
and
views
,
but
with
--
well
,
with
something
*NL*
quite
different
,
whose
existence
she
had
not
realized
before
.
Now
the
*NL*
old
man
attacked
Miss
Bartlett
almost
violently
:
Why
should
she
not
*NL*
change
?
What
possible
objection
had
she
?
They
would
clear
out
in
half
an
*NL*
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
,
though
skilled
in
the
delicacies
of
conversation
,
was
*NL*
powerless
in
the
presence
of
brutality
.
It
was
impossible
to
snub
any
*NL*
one
so
gross
.
Her
face
reddened
with
displeasure
.
She
looked
around
as
*NL*
much
as
to
say
,
``
Are
you
all
like
this
?
''
And
two
little
old
ladies
,
who
*NL*
were
sitting
further
up
the
table
,
with
shawls
hanging
over
the
backs
*NL*
of
the
chairs
,
looked
back
,
clearly
indicating
``
We
are
not
;
we
are
*NL*
genteel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eat
your
dinner
,
dear
,
''
she
said
to
Lucy
,
and
began
to
toy
again
with
*NL*
the
meat
that
she
had
once
censured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
mumbled
that
those
seemed
very
odd
people
opposite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eat
your
dinner
,
dear
.
This
pension
is
a
failure
.
To-morrow
we
will
*NL*
make
a
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
she
announced
this
fell
decision
when
she
reversed
it
.
The
*NL*
curtains
at
the
end
of
the
room
parted
,
and
revealed
a
clergyman
,
stout
*NL*
but
attractive
,
who
hurried
forward
to
take
his
place
at
the
table
,
*NL*
cheerfully
apologizing
for
his
lateness
.
Lucy
,
who
had
not
yet
acquired
*NL*
decency
,
at
once
rose
to
her
feet
,
exclaiming
:
``
Oh
,
oh
!
Why
,
it
's
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
!
Oh
,
how
perfectly
lovely
!
Oh
,
Charlotte
,
we
must
stop
now
,
*NL*
however
bad
the
rooms
are
.
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
said
,
with
more
restraint
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Beebe
?
I
expect
that
you
have
forgotten
us
:
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
and
Miss
Honeychurch
,
who
were
at
Tunbridge
Wells
when
you
*NL*
helped
the
Vicar
of
St.
Peter
's
that
very
cold
Easter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clergyman
,
who
had
the
air
of
one
on
a
holiday
,
did
not
remember
*NL*
the
ladies
quite
as
clearly
as
they
remembered
him
.
But
he
came
forward
*NL*
pleasantly
enough
and
accepted
the
chair
into
which
he
was
beckoned
by
*NL*
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
AM
so
glad
to
see
you
,
''
said
the
girl
,
who
was
in
a
state
of
*NL*
spiritual
starvation
,
and
would
have
been
glad
to
see
the
waiter
if
*NL*
her
cousin
had
permitted
it
.
``
Just
fancy
how
small
the
world
is
.
Summer
*NL*
Street
,
too
,
makes
it
so
specially
funny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Honeychurch
lives
in
the
parish
of
Summer
Street
,
''
said
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
,
filling
up
the
gap
,
``
and
she
happened
to
tell
me
in
the
course
*NL*
of
conversation
that
you
have
just
accepted
the
living
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
heard
from
mother
so
last
week
.
She
did
n't
know
that
I
knew
you
*NL*
at
Tunbridge
Wells
;
but
I
wrote
back
at
once
,
and
I
said
:
`
Mr.
Beebe
*NL*
is
--
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
,
''
said
the
clergyman
.
``
I
move
into
the
Rectory
at
Summer
*NL*
Street
next
June
.
I
am
lucky
to
be
appointed
to
such
a
charming
*NL*
neighbourhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
glad
I
am
!
The
name
of
our
house
is
Windy
Corner
.
''
Mr.
Beebe
*NL*
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
mother
and
me
generally
,
and
my
brother
,
though
it
's
not
often
*NL*
we
get
him
to
ch
--
The
church
is
rather
far
off
,
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
,
dearest
,
let
Mr.
Beebe
eat
his
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
eating
it
,
thank
you
,
and
enjoying
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
preferred
to
talk
to
Lucy
,
whose
playing
he
remembered
,
rather
than
*NL*
to
Miss
Bartlett
,
who
probably
remembered
his
sermons
.
He
asked
the
girl
*NL*
whether
she
knew
Florence
well
,
and
was
informed
at
some
length
that
she
*NL*
had
never
been
there
before
.
It
is
delightful
to
advise
a
newcomer
,
and
*NL*
he
was
first
in
the
field
.
``
Do
n't
neglect
the
country
round
,
''
his
advice
*NL*
concluded
.
``
The
first
fine
afternoon
drive
up
to
Fiesole
,
and
round
by
*NL*
Settignano
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
cried
a
voice
from
the
top
of
the
table
.
``
Mr.
Beebe
,
you
are
*NL*
wrong
.
The
first
fine
afternoon
your
ladies
must
go
to
Prato
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
lady
looks
so
clever
,
''
whispered
Miss
Bartlett
to
her
cousin
.
``
We
*NL*
are
in
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
a
perfect
torrent
of
information
burst
on
them
.
People
told
*NL*
them
what
to
see
,
when
to
see
it
,
how
to
stop
the
electric
trams
,
how
to
*NL*
get
rid
of
the
beggars
,
how
much
to
give
for
a
vellum
blotter
,
how
*NL*
much
the
place
would
grow
upon
them
.
The
Pension
Bertolini
had
decided
,
*NL*
almost
enthusiastically
,
that
they
would
do
.
Whichever
way
they
looked
,
*NL*
kind
ladies
smiled
and
shouted
at
them
.
And
above
all
rose
the
voice
of
*NL*
the
clever
lady
,
crying
:
``
Prato
!
They
must
go
to
Prato
.
That
place
is
*NL*
too
sweetly
squalid
for
words
.
I
love
it
;
I
revel
in
shaking
off
the
*NL*
trammels
of
respectability
,
as
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
named
George
glanced
at
the
clever
lady
,
and
then
returned
*NL*
moodily
to
his
plate
.
Obviously
he
and
his
father
did
not
do
.
Lucy
,
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
her
success
,
found
time
to
wish
they
did
.
It
gave
her
no
*NL*
extra
pleasure
that
any
one
should
be
left
in
the
cold
;
and
when
she
*NL*
rose
to
go
,
she
turned
back
and
gave
the
two
outsiders
a
nervous
little
*NL*
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
did
not
see
it
;
the
son
acknowledged
it
,
not
by
another
bow
,
*NL*
but
by
raising
his
eyebrows
and
smiling
;
he
seemed
to
be
smiling
across
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hastened
after
her
cousin
,
who
had
already
disappeared
through
the
*NL*
curtains
--
curtains
which
smote
one
in
the
face
,
and
seemed
heavy
with
*NL*
more
than
cloth
.
Beyond
them
stood
the
unreliable
Signora
,
bowing
*NL*
good-evening
to
her
guests
,
and
supported
by
`
Enery
,
her
little
boy
,
and
*NL*
Victorier
,
her
daughter
.
It
made
a
curious
little
scene
,
this
attempt
*NL*
of
the
Cockney
to
convey
the
grace
and
geniality
of
the
South
.
And
even
*NL*
more
curious
was
the
drawing-room
,
which
attempted
to
rival
the
solid
*NL*
comfort
of
a
Bloomsbury
boarding-house
.
Was
this
really
Italy
?
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
was
already
seated
on
a
tightly
stuffed
arm-chair
,
which
*NL*
had
the
colour
and
the
contours
of
a
tomato
.
She
was
talking
to
Mr.
*NL*
Beebe
,
and
as
she
spoke
,
her
long
narrow
head
drove
backwards
and
*NL*
forwards
,
slowly
,
regularly
,
as
though
she
were
demolishing
some
*NL*
invisible
obstacle
.
``
We
are
most
grateful
to
you
,
''
she
was
saying
.
*NL*
``
The
first
evening
means
so
much
.
When
you
arrived
we
were
in
for
a
*NL*
peculiarly
mauvais
quart
d'heure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
expressed
his
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
,
by
any
chance
,
know
the
name
of
an
old
man
who
sat
opposite
us
*NL*
at
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emerson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
a
friend
of
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
friendly
--
as
one
is
in
pensions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
will
say
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
her
very
slightly
,
and
she
said
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
as
it
were
,
''
she
concluded
,
``
the
chaperon
of
my
young
cousin
,
*NL*
Lucy
,
and
it
would
be
a
serious
thing
if
I
put
her
under
an
obligation
*NL*
to
people
of
whom
we
know
nothing
.
His
manner
was
somewhat
unfortunate
.
*NL*
I
hope
I
acted
for
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
acted
very
naturally
,
''
said
he
.
He
seemed
thoughtful
,
and
after
*NL*
a
few
moments
added
:
``
All
the
same
,
I
do
n't
think
much
harm
would
have
*NL*
come
of
accepting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
harm
,
of
course
.
But
we
could
not
be
under
an
obligation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
rather
a
peculiar
man
.
''
Again
he
hesitated
,
and
then
said
gently
:
*NL*
``
I
think
he
would
not
take
advantage
of
your
acceptance
,
nor
expect
you
*NL*
to
show
gratitude
.
He
has
the
merit
--
if
it
is
one
--
of
saying
exactly
*NL*
what
he
means
.
He
has
rooms
he
does
not
value
,
and
he
thinks
you
would
*NL*
value
them
.
He
no
more
thought
of
putting
you
under
an
obligation
than
*NL*
he
thought
of
being
polite
.
It
is
so
difficult
--
at
least
,
I
find
it
*NL*
difficult
--
to
understand
people
who
speak
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
pleased
,
and
said
:
``
I
was
hoping
that
he
was
nice
;
I
do
so
*NL*
always
hope
that
people
will
be
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
is
;
nice
and
tiresome
.
I
differ
from
him
on
almost
every
*NL*
point
of
any
importance
,
and
so
,
I
expect
--
I
may
say
I
hope
--
you
will
*NL*
differ
.
But
his
is
a
type
one
disagrees
with
rather
than
deplores
.
When
*NL*
he
first
came
here
he
not
unnaturally
put
people
's
backs
up
.
He
has
no
*NL*
tact
and
no
manners
--
I
do
n't
mean
by
that
that
he
has
bad
manners
--
and
*NL*
he
will
not
keep
his
opinions
to
himself
.
We
nearly
complained
about
*NL*
him
to
our
depressing
Signora
,
but
I
am
glad
to
say
we
thought
better
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
conclude
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
``
that
he
is
a
Socialist
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
accepted
the
convenient
word
,
not
without
a
slight
twitching
*NL*
of
the
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
presumably
he
has
brought
up
his
son
to
be
a
Socialist
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
know
George
,
for
he
has
n't
learnt
to
talk
yet
.
He
seems
a
nice
*NL*
creature
,
and
I
think
he
has
brains
.
Of
course
,
he
has
all
his
father
's
*NL*
mannerisms
,
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
,
too
,
may
be
a
Socialist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
relieve
me
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
.
``
So
you
think
I
ought
to
*NL*
have
accepted
their
offer
?
You
feel
I
have
been
narrow-minded
and
*NL*
suspicious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
he
answered
;
``
I
never
suggested
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
ought
I
not
to
apologize
,
at
all
events
,
for
my
apparent
rudeness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
,
with
some
irritation
,
that
it
would
be
quite
unnecessary
,
*NL*
and
got
up
from
his
seat
to
go
to
the
smoking-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
a
bore
?
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
as
soon
as
he
had
disappeared
.
``
Why
*NL*
did
n't
you
talk

Lucy

He
prefers
young
people
,
I
'm
sure
.
I
do
hope
I
*NL*
have
n't
monopolized
him
.
I
hoped
you
would
have
him
all
the
evening
,
as
*NL*
well
as
all
dinner-time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
nice
,
''
exclaimed
Lucy
.
``
Just
what
I
remember
.
He
seems
to
see
*NL*
good
in
everyone

No

would
take
him
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Lucia

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
what
I

And
you

how
clergymen
generally
laugh

Mr.

laughs
just
like
an
ordinary
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Funny
girl
!
How
you
do
remind
me
of
your

I
wonder

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
she
will
;
and
so
will
Freddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
everyone
at
Windy
Corner
will
approve

it
is
the
fashionable
*NL*
world
.
I
am
used
to
Tunbridge
Wells
,
where
we
are
all
hopelessly
behind
*NL*
the
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lucy
despondently
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
haze
of
disapproval
in
the
air
,
but
whether
the
disapproval
*NL*
was
of
herself
,
or
of
Mr.
Beebe
,
or
of
the
fashionable
world
at
Windy
*NL*
Corner
,
or
of
the
narrow
world
at
Tunbridge
Wells
,
she
could
not
*NL*
determine
.
She
tried
to
locate
it
,
but
as
usual
she
blundered
.
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
sedulously
denied
disapproving
of
any
one
,
and
added
``
I
am
*NL*
afraid
you
are
finding
me
a
very
depressing
companion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
girl
again
thought
:
``
I
must
have
been
selfish
or
unkind
;
I
must
*NL*
be
more
careful
.
It
is
so
dreadful
for
Charlotte
,
being
poor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
one
of
the
little
old
ladies
,
who
for
some
time
had
been
*NL*
smiling
very
benignly
,
now
approached
and
asked
if
she
might
be
allowed
*NL*
to
sit
where
Mr.
Beebe
had
sat
.
Permission
granted
,
she
began
to
chatter
*NL*
gently
about
Italy
,
the
plunge
it
had
been
to
come
there
,
the
gratifying
*NL*
success
of
the
plunge
,
the
improvement
in
her
sister
's
health
,
the
*NL*
necessity
of
closing
the
bed-room
windows
at
night
,
and
of
thoroughly
*NL*
emptying
the
water-bottles
in
the
morning
.
She
handled
her
subjects
*NL*
agreeably
,
and
they
were
,
perhaps
,
more
worthy
of
attention
than
*NL*
the
high
discourse
upon
Guelfs
and
Ghibellines
which
was
proceeding
*NL*
tempestuously
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
It
was
a
real
catastrophe
,
*NL*
not
a
mere
episode
,
that
evening
of
hers
at
Venice
,
when
she
had
found
*NL*
in
her
bedroom
something
that
is
one
worse
than
a
flea
,
though
one
*NL*
better
than
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
here
you
are
as
safe
as
in
England

Signora
Bertolini
is
so
*NL*
English

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
our
rooms
smell

said
poor
Lucy
.
``
We
dread
going
to
bed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
you
look
into
the
court
.
''
She
sighed
.
``
If
only
Mr.
Emerson
was
*NL*
more
tactful
!
We
were
so
sorry
for
you
at
dinner
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
was
meaning
to
be
kind

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
he
was

said
Miss
Bartlett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

has
just
been
scolding
me
for
my
suspicious
nature

I
was
holding
back
on
my
cousin

account

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course

said
the
little
old
lady
;
and
they
murmured
that
one
could
*NL*
not
be
too
careful
with
a
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
tried
to
look
demure
,
but
could
not
help
feeling
a
great
fool
.
No
*NL*
one
was
careful
with
her
at
home
;
or
,
at
all
events
,
she
had
not
noticed
*NL*
it

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
hardly
know

you
ever
noticed
that
there
are
people
who
do
things

are
most

indelicate

yet
at
the

time

beautiful

*NL*
*NL*
``
Beautiful
?

said
Miss
Bartlett
,
puzzled
at
the
word
.
``
Are
not
beauty
*NL*
and
delicacy
the
same

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
one
would
have
thought

said
the
other
helplessly
.
``
But
things
are
*NL*
so
difficult

I
sometimes
think

*NL*
*NL*
She
proceeded
no
further
into
things
,
for
Mr.
Beebe
reappeared
,
looking
*NL*
extremely
pleasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Bartlett

he
cried
,
``
it
's
all
right
about

I

so
glad

*NL*
Mr.
Emerson
was
talking
about
it
in
the
smoking-room
,
and
knowing
what
*NL*
I
did
,
I
encouraged
him
to
make
the
offer
again
.
He
has
let
me
come
and
*NL*
ask
you

He
would
be
so
pleased

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Charlotte

cried
Lucy
to
her
cousin
,
``
we
must
have
the
rooms
now

The
old
man
is
just
as
nice

kind
as

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear

''
said
Mr.
Beebe
,
after
a
pause
,
``

have
been
officious

I
*NL*
must
apologize
for
my
interference

*NL*
*NL*
Gravely
displeased
,
he
turned
to
go
.
Not
till
then
did
Miss
Bartlett
*NL*
reply
:
``
My
own
wishes
,
dearest
Lucy

are
unimportant
in
comparison

be
hard

I
stopped
you
doing

Florence

Would
you
then
,
*NL*
Mr.

kindly
tell
Mr.

that
I
accept
his
kind
offer

conduct
him

in
order

I
may
thank
him
personally

*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
voice
as
she
spoke
;
it
was
heard
all
over
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
and
silenced
the
Guelfs
and
the
Ghibellines
.
The
*NL*
clergyman
,
inwardly
cursing
the
female
sex
,
bowed
,
and
departed
with
her
*NL*
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,

Grant
me
that

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
was
back
,
saying
rather
nervously
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Emerson
is
engaged
,
but
here
is
his
son
instead

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
gazed
down
on
the
three
ladies
,
who
felt
seated
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
so
low
were
their
chairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
,
''
he
said
,
``
is
in
his
bath
,
so
you
can
not
thank
him
*NL*
personally

But
any
message
given
by
you

me
will
be
given
by
me
to
*NL*
him
as
soon
as
he
comes
out

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
was
unequal
to
the
bath
.
All
her
barbed
civilities
came
*NL*
forth
wrong
end
first
.
Young
Mr.
Emerson
scored
a
notable
triumph
to
the
*NL*
delight
of
Mr.
Beebe
and
to
the
secret
delight
of
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
young
man
!
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
angry
he
is
with
his
father
about
the
rooms

It
is
all
he
can
do
to
*NL*
keep
polite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
half
an
hour
or
so
your
rooms
will
be
ready
,
''
said
Mr.
Beebe
.
Then
*NL*
looking
rather
thoughtfully
at
the
two
cousins
,
he
retired
to
his
own
*NL*
rooms
,
to
write
up
his
philosophic
diary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
''
breathed
the
little
old
lady
,
and
shuddered
as
if
all
the
*NL*
winds
of
heaven
had
entered
the
apartment
.
``
Gentlemen
sometimes
do
not
*NL*
realize
--
''
Her
voice
faded
away
,
but
Miss
Bartlett
seemed
to
understand
*NL*
and
a
conversation
developed
,
in
which
gentlemen
who
did
not
thoroughly
*NL*
realize
played
a
principal
part
.
Lucy
,
not
realizing
either
,
was
reduced
*NL*
to
literature
.
Taking
up
Baedeker
's
Handbook
to
Northern
Italy
,
she
*NL*
committed
to
memory
the
most
important
dates
of
Florentine
History
.
For
*NL*
she
was
determined
to
enjoy
herself
on
the
morrow
.
Thus
the
half-hour
*NL*
crept
profitably
away
,
and
at
last
Miss
Bartlett
rose
with
a
sigh
,
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
one
might
venture
now

No

not
stir

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you

do
everything
,
''
said
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally
,
dear
.
It
is
my
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
would
like
to
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear

''
*NL*
*NL*
Charlotte
's
energy
!
And
her
unselfishness
!
She
had
been
thus
all
her
*NL*
life
,
but
really
,
on
this
Italian
tour
,
she
was
surpassing
herself
.
So
*NL*
Lucy
felt
,
or
strove
to
feel
.
And
yet
--
there
was
a
rebellious
spirit
*NL*
in
her
which
wondered
whether
the
acceptance
might
not
have
been
less
*NL*
delicate
and
more
beautiful
.
At
all
events
,
she
entered
her
own
room
*NL*
without
any
feeling
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
explain
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
``
why
it
is
that
I
have
taken
*NL*
the
largest
room
.
Naturally
,
of
course
,
I
should
have
given
it
to
you
;
*NL*
but
I
happen
to
know
that
it
belongs
to
the
young
man
,
and
I
was
sure
*NL*
your
mother
would
not
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
to
accept
a
favour
it
is
more
suitable
you
should
be
under
*NL*
an
obligation
to
his
father
than
to
him
.
I
am
a
woman
of
the
world
,
in
*NL*
my
small
way
,
and
I
know
where
things
lead
to
.
However
,
Mr.
Beebe
is
a
*NL*
guarantee
of
a
sort
that
they
will
not
presume
on
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
would
n't
mind
I
'm
sure
,
''
said
Lucy
,
but
again
had
the
sense
of
*NL*
larger
and
unsuspected
issues
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
only
sighed
,
and
enveloped
her
in
a
protecting
embrace
as
*NL*
she
wished
her
good-night
.
It
gave
Lucy
the
sensation
of
a
fog
,
and
when
*NL*
she
reached
her
own
room
she
opened
the
window
and
breathed
the
clean
*NL*
night
air
,
thinking
of
the
kind
old
man
who
had
enabled
her
to
see
the
*NL*
lights
dancing
in
the
Arno
and
the
cypresses
of
San
Miniato
,
and
the
*NL*
foot-hills
of
the
Apennines
,
black
against
the
rising
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
,
in
her
room
,
fastened
the
window-shutters
and
locked
the
*NL*
door
,
and
then
made
a
tour
of
the
apartment
to
see
where
the
cupboards
*NL*
led
,
and
whether
there
were
any
oubliettes
or
secret
entrances
.
It
was
*NL*
then
that
she
saw
,
pinned
up
over
the
washstand
,
a
sheet
of
paper
on
*NL*
which
was
scrawled
an
enormous
note
of
interrogation
.
Nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
mean
?
''
she
thought
,
and
she
examined
it
carefully
by
the
*NL*
light
of
a
candle
.
Meaningless
at
first
,
it
gradually
became
menacing
,
*NL*
obnoxious
,
portentous
with
evil
.
She
was
seized
with
an
impulse
to
*NL*
destroy
it
,
but
fortunately
remembered
that
she
had
no
right
to
do
so
,
*NL*
since
it
must
be
the
property
of
young
Mr.
Emerson
.
So
she
unpinned
it
*NL*
carefully
,
and
put
it
between
two
pieces
of
blotting-paper
to
keep
it
*NL*
clean
for
him
.
Then
she
completed
her
inspection
of
the
room
,
sighed
*NL*
heavily
according
to
her
habit
,
and
went
to
bed
.

Chapter
II
:
In
Santa
Croce
with
No
Baedeker
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
pleasant
to
wake
up
in
Florence
,
to
open
the
eyes
upon
a
bright
*NL*
bare
room
,
with
a
floor
of
red
tiles
which
look
clean
though
they
are
*NL*
not
;
with
a
painted
ceiling
whereon
pink
griffins
and
blue
amorini
sport
*NL*
in
a
forest
of
yellow
violins
and
bassoons
.
It
was
pleasant
,
too
,
to
*NL*
fling
wide
the
windows
,
pinching
the
fingers
in
unfamiliar
fastenings
,
*NL*
to
lean
out
into
sunshine
with
beautiful
hills
and
trees
and
marble
*NL*
churches
opposite
,
and
close
below
,
the
Arno
,
gurgling
against
the
*NL*
embankment
of
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
the
river
men
were
at
work
with
spades
and
sieves
on
the
sandy
*NL*
foreshore
,
and
on
the
river
was
a
boat
,
also
diligently
employed
for
*NL*
some
mysterious
end
.
An
electric
tram
came
rushing
underneath
the
*NL*
window
.
No
one
was
inside
it
,
except
one
tourist
;
but
its
platforms
were
*NL*
overflowing
with
Italians
,
who
preferred
to
stand
.
Children
tried
to
*NL*
hang
on
behind
,
and
the
conductor
,
with
no
malice
,
spat
in
their
faces
*NL*
to
make
them
let
go
.
Then
soldiers
appeared
--
good-looking
,
undersized
*NL*
men
--
wearing
each
a
knapsack
covered
with
mangy
fur
,
and
a
great-coat
*NL*
which
had
been
cut
for
some
larger
soldier
.
Beside
them
walked
officers
,
*NL*
looking
foolish
and
fierce
,
and
before
them
went
little
boys
,
turning
*NL*
somersaults
in
time
with
the
band
.
The
tramcar
became
entangled
in
their
*NL*
ranks
,
and
moved
on
painfully
,
like
a
caterpillar
in
a
swarm
of
ants
.
*NL*
One
of
the
little
boys
fell
down
,
and
some
white
bullocks
came
out
of
*NL*
an
archway
.
Indeed
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
good
advice
of
an
old
man
*NL*
who
was
selling
button-hooks
,
the
road
might
never
have
got
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
such
trivialities
as
these
many
a
valuable
hour
may
slip
away
,
*NL*
and
the
traveller
who
has
gone
to
Italy
to
study
the
tactile
values
of
*NL*
Giotto
,
or
the
corruption
of
the
Papacy
,
may
return
remembering
nothing
*NL*
but
the
blue
sky
and
the
men
and
women
who
live
under
it
.
So
it
was
as
*NL*
well
that
Miss
Bartlett
should
tap
and
come
in
,
and
having
commented
on
*NL*
Lucy
's
leaving
the
door
unlocked
,
and
on
her
leaning
out
of
the
window
*NL*
before
she
was
fully
dressed
,
should
urge
her
to
hasten
herself
,
or
the
*NL*
best
of
the
day
would
be
gone
.
By
the
time
Lucy
was
ready
her
cousin
*NL*
had
done
her
breakfast
,
and
was
listening
to
the
clever
lady
among
the
*NL*
crumbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
conversation
then
ensued
,
on
not
unfamiliar
lines
.
Miss
Bartlett
*NL*
was
,
after
all
,
a
wee
bit
tired
,
and
thought
they
had
better
spend
the
*NL*
morning
settling
in
;
unless
Lucy
would
at
all
like
to
go
out
?
Lucy
would
*NL*
rather
like
to
go
out
,
as
it
was
her
first
day
in
Florence
,
but
,
of
*NL*
course
,
she
could
go
alone
.
Miss
Bartlett
could
not
allow
this
.
Of
*NL*
course
she
would
accompany
Lucy
everywhere
.
Oh
,
certainly
not
;
Lucy
*NL*
would
stop
with
her
cousin
.
Oh
,
no
!
that
would
never
do
.
Oh
,
yes
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
the
clever
lady
broke
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
Mrs.
Grundy
who
is
troubling
you
,
I
do
assure
you
that
you
*NL*
can
neglect
the
good
person
.
Being
English
,
Miss
Honeychurch
will
be
*NL*
perfectly
safe
.
Italians
understand
.
A
dear
friend
of
mine
,
Contessa
*NL*
Baroncelli
,
has
two
daughters
,
and
when
she
can
not
send
a
maid
to
school
*NL*
with
them
,
she
lets
them
go
in
sailor-hats
instead
.
Every
one
takes
*NL*
them
for
English
,
you
see
,
especially
if
their
hair
is
strained
tightly
*NL*
behind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
was
unconvinced
by
the
safety
of
Contessa
Baroncelli
's
*NL*
daughters
.
She
was
determined
to
take
Lucy
herself
,
her
head
not
being
*NL*
so
very
bad
.
The
clever
lady
then
said
that
she
was
going
to
spend
a
*NL*
long
morning
in
Santa
Croce
,
and
if
Lucy
would
come
too
,
she
would
be
*NL*
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
you
by
a
dear
dirty
back
way
,
Miss
Honeychurch
,
and
if
you
*NL*
bring
me
luck
,
we
shall
have
an
adventure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
said
that
this
was
most
kind
,
and
at
once
opened
the
Baedeker
,
to
*NL*
see
where
Santa
Croce
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
,
tut
!
Miss
Lucy
!
I
hope
we
shall
soon
emancipate
you
from
Baedeker
.
*NL*
He
does
but
touch
the
surface
of
things
.
As
to
the
true
Italy
--
he
does
*NL*
not
even
dream
of
it
.
The
true
Italy
is
only
to
be
found
by
patient
*NL*
observation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
sounded
very
interesting
,
and
Lucy
hurried
over
her
breakfast
,
and
*NL*
started
with
her
new
friend
in
high
spirits
.
Italy
was
coming
at
last
.
*NL*
The
Cockney
Signora
and
her
works
had
vanished
like
a
bad
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
--
for
that
was
the
clever
lady
's
name
--
turned
to
the
right
*NL*
along
the
sunny
Lung
'
Arno
.
How
delightfully
warm
!
But
a
wind
down
*NL*
the
side
streets
cut
like
a
knife
,
did
n't
it
?
Ponte
alle
*NL*
Grazie
--
particularly
interesting
,
mentioned
by
Dante
.
San
*NL*
Miniato
--
beautiful
as
well
as
interesting
;
the
crucifix
that
kissed
*NL*
a
murderer
--
Miss
Honeychurch
would
remember
the
story
.
The
men
on
the
*NL*
river
were
fishing
.
-LRB-
Untrue
;
but
then
,
so
is
most
information
.
-RRB-
Then
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
darted
under
the
archway
of
the
white
bullocks
,
and
she
*NL*
stopped
,
and
she
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
smell
!
a
true
Florentine
smell
!
Every
city
,
let
me
teach
you
,
has
its
*NL*
own
smell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
very
nice
smell
?
''
said
Lucy
,
who
had
inherited
from
her
mother
*NL*
a
distaste
to
dirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
does
n't
come
to
Italy
for
niceness
,
''
was
the
retort
;
``
one
comes
for
*NL*
life
.
Buon
giorno
!
Buon
giorno
!
''
bowing
right
and
left
.
``
Look
at
that
*NL*
adorable
wine-cart
!
How
the
driver
stares
at
us
,
dear
,
simple
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Miss
Lavish
proceeded
through
the
streets
of
the
city
of
Florence
,
*NL*
short
,
fidgety
,
and
playful
as
a
kitten
,
though
without
a
kitten
's
*NL*
grace
.
It
was
a
treat
for
the
girl
to
be
with
any
one
so
clever
and
so
*NL*
cheerful
;
and
a
blue
military
cloak
,
such
as
an
Italian
officer
wears
,
*NL*
only
increased
the
sense
of
festivity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Buon
giorno
!
Take
the
word
of
an
old
woman
,
Miss
Lucy
:
you
will
*NL*
never
repent
of
a
little
civility
to
your
inferiors
.
That
is
the
*NL*
true
democracy
.
Though
I
am
a
real
Radical
as
well
.
There
,
now
you
're
*NL*
shocked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
'm
not
!
''
exclaimed
Lucy
.
``
We
are
Radicals
,
too
,
out
and
out
.
*NL*
My
father
always
voted
for
Mr.
Gladstone

until
he
was
so
dreadful
about
*NL*
Ireland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see

I

And
now
you
have
gone
over

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

please

If
my
father
was
alive
,
I
am
sure
he
would
vote
Radical
*NL*
again
now
that
Ireland
is
all
right

And
as
it
is
,
the
glass
over
our
*NL*
front
door
was
broken
last
election
,
and
Freddy
is
sure
it
was
the
*NL*
Tories
;
but
mother
says
nonsense

a
tramp

*NL*
*NL*
``
Shameful

manufacturing
district

I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

in
the
Surrey
hills
.
About
five
miles
from
Dorking
,
looking
over
*NL*
the
Weald
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
seemed
interested
,
and
slackened
her
trot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
delightful
part
;
I
know
it
so
well
.
It
is
full
of
the
very
*NL*
nicest
people

Do
you
know
Sir
Harry
Otway
--
a
Radical
if
ever
there
*NL*
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
indeed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
old
Mrs.
Butterworth
the
philanthropist
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
she
rents
a
field
of
us
!
How
funny
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
looked
at
the
narrow
ribbon
of
sky
,
and
murmured
:
``
Oh
,
you
*NL*
have
property
in
Surrey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hardly
any
,
''
said
Lucy
,
fearful
of
being
thought
a
snob
.
``
Only
thirty
*NL*
acres
--
just
the
garden
,
all
downhill
,
and
some
fields
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
was
not
disgusted
,
and
said
it
was
just
the
size
of
her
*NL*
aunt
's
Suffolk
estate
.
Italy
receded
.
They
tried
to
remember
the
last
*NL*
name
of
Lady
Louisa
someone
,
who
had
taken
a
house
near
Summer
Street
*NL*
the
other
year
,
but
she
had
not
liked
it
,
which
was
odd
of
her
.
And
just
*NL*
as
Miss
Lavish
had
got
the
name
,
she
broke
off
and
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
us
!
Bless
us
and
save
us
!
We
've
lost
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
they
had
seemed
a
long
time
in
reaching
Santa
Croce
,
the
tower
*NL*
of
which
had
been
plainly
visible
from
the
landing
window
.
But
Miss
*NL*
Lavish
had
said
so
much
about
knowing
her
Florence
by
heart
,
that
Lucy
*NL*
had
followed
her
with
no
misgivings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lost
!
lost
!
My
dear
Miss
Lucy
,
during
our
political
diatribes
we
have
*NL*
taken
a
wrong
turning
.
How
those
horrid
Conservatives
would
jeer
at
us
!
*NL*
What
are
we
to
do
?
Two
lone
females
in
an
unknown
town
.
Now
,
this
is
*NL*
what
I
call
an
adventure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
,
who
wanted
to
see
Santa
Croce
,
suggested
,
as
a
possible
solution
,
*NL*
that
they
should
ask
the
way
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
that
is
the
word
of
a
craven
!
And
no
,
you
are
not
,
not
,
NOT
to
*NL*
look
at
your
Baedeker
.
Give
it
to
me
;
I
sha
n't
let
you
carry
it
.
We
will
*NL*
simply
drift
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
they
drifted
through
a
series
of
those
grey-brown
streets
,
*NL*
neither
commodious
nor
picturesque
,
in
which
the
eastern
quarter
of
the
*NL*
city
abounds
.
Lucy
soon
lost
interest
in
the
discontent
of
Lady
*NL*
Louisa
,
and
became
discontented
herself
.
For
one
ravishing
moment
Italy
*NL*
appeared
.
She
stood
in
the
Square
of
the
Annunziata
and
saw
in
the
*NL*
living
terra-cotta
those
divine
babies
whom
no
cheap
reproduction
can
*NL*
ever
stale
.
There
they
stood
,
with
their
shining
limbs
bursting
from
*NL*
the
garments
of
charity
,
and
their
strong
white
arms
extended
against
*NL*
circlets
of
heaven
.
Lucy
thought
she
had
never
seen
anything
more
*NL*
beautiful
;
but
Miss
Lavish
,
with
a
shriek
of
dismay
,
dragged
her
*NL*
forward
,
declaring
that
they
were
out
of
their
path
now
by
at
least
a
*NL*
mile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
was
approaching
at
which
the
continental
breakfast
begins
,
or
*NL*
rather
ceases
,
to
tell
,
and
the
ladies
bought
some
hot
chestnut
paste
*NL*
out
of
a
little
shop
,
because
it
looked
so
typical
.
It
tasted
partly
*NL*
of
the
paper
in
which
it
was
wrapped
,
partly
of
hair
oil
,
partly
of
the
*NL*
great
unknown
.
But
it
gave
them
strength
to
drift
into
another
Piazza
,
*NL*
large
and
dusty
,
on
the
farther
side
of
which
rose
a
black-and-white
*NL*
facade
of
surpassing
ugliness
.
Miss
Lavish
spoke
to
it
dramatically
.
It
*NL*
was
Santa
Croce
.
The
adventure
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
minute
;
let
those
two
people
go
on
,
or
I
shall
have
to
speak
to
*NL*
them
.
I
do
detest
conventional
intercourse
.
Nasty
!
they
are
going
into
*NL*
the
church
,
too
.
Oh
,
the
Britisher
abroad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
sat
opposite
them
at
dinner
last
night
.
They
have
given
us
their
*NL*
rooms
.
They
were
so
very
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
their
figures
!
''
laughed
Miss
Lavish
.
``
They
walk
through
my
*NL*
Italy
like
a
pair
of
cows
.
It
's
very
naughty
of
me
,
but
I
would
like
*NL*
to
set
an
examination
paper
at
Dover
,
and
turn
back
every
tourist
who
*NL*
could
n't
pass
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
ask
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
laid
her
hand
pleasantly
on
Lucy
's
arm
,
as
if
to
suggest
*NL*
that
she
,
at
all
events
,
would
get
full
marks
.
In
this
exalted
mood
they
*NL*
reached
the
steps
of
the
great
church
,
and
were
about
to
enter
it
when
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
stopped
,
squeaked
,
flung
up
her
arms
,
and
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
goes
my
local-colour
box
!
I
must
have
a
word
with
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
a
moment
she
was
away
over
the
Piazza
,
her
military
cloak
*NL*
flapping
in
the
wind
;
nor
did
she
slacken
speed
till
she
caught
up
an
*NL*
old
man
with
white
whiskers
,
and
nipped
him
playfully
upon
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
waited
for
nearly
ten
minutes
.
Then
she
began
to
get
tired
.
The
*NL*
beggars
worried
her
,
the
dust
blew
in
her
eyes
,
and
she
remembered
that
*NL*
a
young
girl
ought
not
to
loiter
in
public
places
.
She
descended
slowly
*NL*
into
the
Piazza
with
the
intention
of
rejoining
Miss
Lavish
,
who
was
*NL*
really
almost
too
original
.
But
at
that
moment
Miss
Lavish
and
her
*NL*
local-colour
box
moved
also
,
and
disappeared
down
a
side
street
,
both
*NL*
gesticulating
largely
.
Tears
of
indignation
came
to
Lucy
's
eyes
partly
*NL*
because
Miss
Lavish
had
jilted
her
,
partly
because
she
had
taken
her
*NL*
Baedeker
.
How
could
she
find
her
way
home
?
How
could
she
find
her
way
*NL*
about
in
Santa
Croce
?
Her
first
morning
was
ruined
,
and
she
might
never
*NL*
be
in
Florence
again
.
A
few
minutes
ago
she
had
been
all
high
spirits
,
*NL*
talking
as
a
woman
of
culture
,
and
half
persuading
herself
that
she
*NL*
was
full
of
originality
.
Now
she
entered
the
church
depressed
and
*NL*
humiliated
,
not
even
able
to
remember
whether
it
was
built
by
the
*NL*
Franciscans
or
the
Dominicans
.
Of
course
,
it
must
be
a
wonderful
*NL*
building
.
But
how
like
a
barn
!
And
how
very
cold
!
Of
course
,
it
*NL*
contained
frescoes
by
Giotto
,
in
the
presence
of
whose
tactile
values
*NL*
she
was
capable
of
feeling
what
was
proper
.
But
who
was
to
tell
*NL*
her
which
they
were
?
She
walked
about
disdainfully
,
unwilling
to
be
*NL*
enthusiastic
over
monuments
of
uncertain
authorship
or
date
.
There
was
*NL*
no
one
even
to
tell
her
which
,
of
all
the
sepulchral
slabs
that
paved
*NL*
the
nave
and
transepts
,
was
the
one
that
was
really
beautiful
,
the
one
*NL*
that
had
been
most
praised
by
Mr.
Ruskin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
pernicious
charm
of
Italy
worked
on
her
,
and
,
instead
of
*NL*
acquiring
information
,
she
began
to
be
happy
.
She
puzzled
out
the
*NL*
Italian
notices
--
the
notices
that
forbade
people
to
introduce
dogs
into
*NL*
the
church
--
the
notice
that
prayed
people
,
in
the
interest
of
health
and
*NL*
out
of
respect
to
the
sacred
edifice
in
which
they
found
themselves
,
*NL*
not
to
spit
.
She
watched
the
tourists
;
their
noses
were
as
red
as
their
*NL*
Baedekers
,
so
cold
was
Santa
Croce
.
She
beheld
the
horrible
fate
that
*NL*
overtook
three
Papists
--
two
he-babies
and
a
she-baby
--
who
began
their
*NL*
career
by
sousing
each
other
with
the
Holy
Water
,
and
then
proceeded
to
*NL*
the
Machiavelli
memorial
,
dripping
but
hallowed
.
Advancing
towards
it
*NL*
very
slowly
and
from
immense
distances
,
they
touched
the
stone
with
*NL*
their
fingers
,
with
their
handkerchiefs
,
with
their
heads
,
and
then
*NL*
retreated
.
What
could
this
mean
?
They
did
it
again
and
again
.
Then
Lucy
*NL*
realized
that
they
had
mistaken
Machiavelli
for
some
saint
,
hoping
*NL*
to
acquire
virtue
.
Punishment
followed
quickly
.
The
smallest
he-baby
*NL*
stumbled
over
one
of
the
sepulchral
slabs
so
much
admired
by
Mr.
Ruskin
,
*NL*
and
entangled
his
feet
in
the
features
of
a
recumbent
bishop
.
Protestant
*NL*
as
she
was
,
Lucy
darted
forward
.
She
was
too
late
.
He
fell
heavily
upon
*NL*
the
prelate
's
upturned
toes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hateful
bishop
!
''
exclaimed
the
voice
of
old
Mr.
Emerson
,
who
had
darted
*NL*
forward
also
.
``
Hard
in
life
,
hard
in
death
.
Go
out
into
the
sunshine
,
*NL*
little
boy
,
and
kiss
your
hand
to
the
sun
,
for
that
is
where
you
ought
*NL*
to
be
.
Intolerable
bishop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
screamed
frantically
at
these
words
,
and
at
these
dreadful
*NL*
people
who
picked
him
up
,
dusted
him
,
rubbed
his
bruises
,
and
told
him
*NL*
not
to
be
superstitious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
him
!
''
said
Mr.
Emerson
to
Lucy
.
``
Here
's
a
mess
:
a
baby
hurt
,
*NL*
cold
,
and
frightened
!
But
what
else
can
you
expect
from
a
church
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
's
legs
had
become
as
melting
wax
.
Each
time
that
old
Mr.
*NL*
Emerson
and
Lucy
set
it
erect
it
collapsed
with
a
roar
.
Fortunately
an
*NL*
Italian
lady
,
who
ought
to
have
been
saying
her
prayers
,
came
to
the
*NL*
rescue
.
By
some
mysterious
virtue
,
which
mothers
alone
possess
,
she
*NL*
stiffened
the
little
boy
's
back-bone
and
imparted
strength
to
his
knees
.
*NL*
He
stood
.
Still
gibbering
with
agitation
,
he
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
clever
woman
,
''
said
Mr.
Emerson
.
``
You
have
done
more
than
*NL*
all
the
relics
in
the
world
.
I
am
not
of
your
creed
,
but
I
do
believe
in
*NL*
those
who
make
their
fellow-creatures
happy
.
There
is
no
scheme
of
the
*NL*
universe
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
for
a
phrase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Niente
,
''
said
the
Italian
lady
,
and
returned
to
her
prayers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
she
understands
English
,
''
suggested
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
chastened
mood
she
no
longer
despised
the
Emersons
.
She
was
*NL*
determined
to
be
gracious
to
them
,
beautiful
rather
than
delicate
,
*NL*
and
,
if
possible
,
to
erase
Miss
Bartlett
's
civility
by
some
gracious
*NL*
reference
to
the
pleasant
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
woman
understands
everything
,
''
was
Mr.
Emerson
's
reply
.
``
But
what
*NL*
are
you
doing
here
?
Are
you
doing
the
church
?
Are
you
through
with
the
*NL*
church
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
cried
Lucy
,
remembering
her
grievance
.
``
I
came
here
with
Miss
*NL*
Lavish
,
who
was
to
explain
everything
;
and
just
by
the
door
--
it
is
too
*NL*
bad
!
--
she
simply
ran
away
,
and
after
waiting
quite
a
time
,
I
had
to
come
*NL*
in
by
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
you
?
''
said
Mr.
Emerson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
why
should
n't
you
come
by
yourself
?
''
said
the
son
,
addressing
the
*NL*
young
lady
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Miss
Lavish
has
even
taken
away
Baedeker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baedeker
?
''
said
Mr.
Emerson
.
``
I
'm
glad
it
's
THAT
you
minded
.
It
's
worth
*NL*
minding
,
the
loss
of
a
Baedeker
.
THAT
'S
worth
minding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
puzzled
.
She
was
again
conscious
of
some
new
idea
,
and
was
not
*NL*
sure
whither
it
would
lead
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
've
no
Baedeker
,
''
said
the
son
,
``
you
'd
better
join
us
.
''
Was
this
*NL*
where
the
idea
would
lead
?
She
took
refuge
in
her
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
very
much
,
but
I
could
not
think
of
that
.
I
hope
you
do
not
*NL*
suppose
that
I
came
to
join
on
to
you
.
I
really
came
to
help
with
the
*NL*
child
,
and
to
thank
you
for
so
kindly
giving
us
your
rooms
last
night
.
I
*NL*
hope
that
you
have
not
been
put
to
any
great
inconvenience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
the
old
man
gently
,
``
I
think
that
you
are
repeating
what
*NL*
you
have
heard
older
people
say
.
You
are
pretending
to
be
touchy
;
but
*NL*
you
are
not
really
.
Stop
being
so
tiresome
,
and
tell
me
instead
what
*NL*
part
of
the
church
you
want
to
see
.
To
take
you
to
it
will
be
a
real
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
this
was
abominably
impertinent
,
and
she
ought
to
have
been
*NL*
furious
.
But
it
is
sometimes
as
difficult
to
lose
one
's
temper
as
it
*NL*
is
difficult
at
other
times
to
keep
it
.
Lucy
could
not
get
cross
.
Mr.
*NL*
Emerson
was
an
old
man
,
and
surely
a
girl
might
humour
him
.
On
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
his
son
was
a
young
man
,
and
she
felt
that
a
girl
ought
to
be
*NL*
offended
with
him
,
or
at
all
events
be
offended
before
him
.
It
was
at
*NL*
him
that
she
gazed
before
replying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
touchy
,
I
hope
.
It
is
the
Giottos
that
I
want
to
see
,
if
you
*NL*
will
kindly
tell
me
which
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
son
nodded
.
With
a
look
of
sombre
satisfaction
,
he
led
the
way
to
*NL*
the
Peruzzi
Chapel
.
There
was
a
hint
of
the
teacher
about
him
.
She
felt
*NL*
like
a
child
in
school
who
had
answered
a
question
rightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chapel
was
already
filled
with
an
earnest
congregation
,
and
out
of
*NL*
them
rose
the
voice
of
a
lecturer
,
directing
them
how
to
worship
Giotto
,
*NL*
not
by
tactful
valuations
,
but
by
the
standards
of
the
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
''
he
was
saying
,
``
the
facts
about
this
church
of
Santa
Croce
;
*NL*
how
it
was
built
by
faith
in
the
full
fervour
of
medievalism
,
before
*NL*
any
taint
of
the
Renaissance
had
appeared
.
Observe
how
Giotto
in
these
*NL*
frescoes
--
now
,
unhappily
,
ruined
by
restoration
--
is
untroubled
by
the
*NL*
snares
of
anatomy
and
perspective
.
Could
anything
be
more
majestic
,
more
*NL*
pathetic
,
beautiful
,
true
?
How
little
,
we
feel
,
avails
knowledge
and
*NL*
technical
cleverness
against
a
man
who
truly
feels
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Emerson
,
in
much
too
loud
a
voice
for
church
.
*NL*
``
Remember
nothing
of
the
sort
!
Built
by
faith
indeed
!
That
simply
means
*NL*
the
workmen
were
n't
paid
properly
.
And
as
for
the
frescoes
,
I
see
no
*NL*
truth
in
them
.
Look
at
that
fat
man
in
blue
!
He
must
weigh
as
much
as
I
*NL*
do
,
and
he
is
shooting
into
the
sky
like
an
air
balloon

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
referring
to
the
fresco
of
the
``
Ascension
of
St.
John
.
''
Inside
,
*NL*
the
lecturer
's
voice
faltered
,
as
well
it
might
.
The
audience
shifted
*NL*
uneasily
,
and
so
did
Lucy
.
She
was
sure
that
she
ought
not
to
be
with
*NL*
these
men
;
but
they
had
cast
a
spell
over
her
.
They
were
so
serious
and
*NL*
so
strange
that
she
could
not
remember
how
to
behave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
did
this
happen
,
or
did
n't
it
?
Yes
or
no

*NL*
*NL*
George
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
happened
like
this

if
it
happened
at
all

I
would
rather
go
up

heaven

myself
than
be
pushed
by
cherubs

if
I
got
there
I
should

like
my

lean
out
of
it

just
as
they
do
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

said
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon

said
a
frigid

The

The
lecturer
was
a
clergyman
,
and
his
audience
must
be
also
his
flock
,
*NL*
for
they
held
prayer-books
as
well
as
guide-books
in
their
hands
.
They
*NL*
filed
out
of
the
chapel
in
silence
.
Amongst
them
were
the
two
little
old
*NL*
ladies
of
the
Pension
Bertolini
--
Miss
Teresa
and
Miss
Catherine
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop

cried
Mr.
Emerson

``
There
's
plenty
of
room
for
us
all

Stop

*NL*
*NL*
The
procession
disappeared
without
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
the
lecturer
could
be
heard
in
the
next
chapel
,
describing
the
life
*NL*
of
St.
Francis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
I
do
believe
that
clergyman
is
the
Brixton

*NL*
*NL*
George
went
into
the
next
chapel
and
returned
,
saying
``
Perhaps
he
is

I
*NL*
do
n't
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
had
better
speak

remind

who
I
am

It
's
that
Mr.

Eager
.
Why
did
he
go
?
Did
we
talk
too
loud
?
How
vexatious

I
shall
go
*NL*
and
say
we
are
sorry

Had
n't
I
better

Then
perhaps
he
will
come
back

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
not
come
back
,
''
said
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Emerson
,
contrite
and
unhappy
,
hurried
away
to
apologize
to
the
*NL*
Rev.
Cuthbert
Eager
.
Lucy
,
apparently
absorbed
in
a
lunette
,
could
hear
*NL*
the
lecture
again
interrupted
,
the
anxious
,
aggressive
voice
of
the
old
*NL*
man
,
the
curt
,
injured
replies
of
his
opponent
.
The
son
,
who
took
every
*NL*
little
contretemps
as
if
it
were
a
tragedy
,
was
listening
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
has
that
effect
on
nearly
everyone
,
''
he
informed
her
.
``
He
*NL*
will
try
to
be
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
we
all
try
,
''
said
she
,
smiling
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
we
think
it
improves
our
characters
.
But
he
is
kind
to
people
*NL*
because
he
loves
them
;
and
they
find
him
out
,
and
are
offended
,
or
*NL*
frightened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
silly
of
them
!
''
said
Lucy
,
though
in
her
heart
she
sympathized
;
``
I
*NL*
think
that
a
kind
action
done
tactfully
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tact
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
up
his
head
in
disdain
.
Apparently
she
had
given
the
wrong
*NL*
answer
.
She
watched
the
singular
creature
pace
up
and
down
the
chapel
.
*NL*
For
a
young
man
his
face
was
rugged
,
and
--
until
the
shadows
fell
upon
*NL*
it
--
hard
.
Enshadowed
,
it
sprang
into
tenderness
.
She
saw
him
once
again
*NL*
at
Rome
,
on
the
ceiling
of
the
Sistine
Chapel
,
carrying
a
burden
of
*NL*
acorns
.
Healthy
and
muscular
,
he
yet
gave
her
the
feeling
of
greyness
,
*NL*
of
tragedy
that
might
only
find
solution
in
the
night
.
The
feeling
soon
*NL*
passed
;
it
was
unlike
her
to
have
entertained
anything
so
subtle
.
Born
*NL*
of
silence
and
of
unknown
emotion
,
it
passed
when
Mr.
Emerson
returned
,
*NL*
and
she
could
re-enter
the
world
of
rapid
talk
,
which
was
alone
familiar
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
snubbed
?
''
asked
his
son
tranquilly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
have
spoilt
the
pleasure
of
I
do
n't
know
how
many
people
.
They
*NL*
wo
n't
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
full
of
innate
sympathy
...
quickness
to
perceive
good
in
*NL*
others
...
vision
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
...
''
Scraps
of
the
lecture
on
*NL*
St.
Francis
came
floating
round
the
partition
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
us
spoil
yours
,
''
he
continued
to
Lucy
.
``
Have
you
looked
at
*NL*
those
saints
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lucy
.
``
They
are
lovely
.
Do
you
know
which
is
the
tombstone
*NL*
that
is
praised
in
Ruskin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
,
and
suggested
that
they
should
try
to
guess
it
.
George
,
*NL*
rather
to
her
relief
,
refused
to
move
,
and
she
and
the
old
man
wandered
*NL*
not
unpleasantly
about
Santa
Croce
,
which
,
though
it
is
like
a
barn
,
*NL*
has
harvested
many
beautiful
things
inside
its
walls
.
There
were
also
*NL*
beggars
to
avoid
and
guides
to
dodge
round
the
pillars
,
and
an
old
lady
*NL*
with
her
dog
,
and
here
and
there
a
priest
modestly
edging
to
his
*NL*
Mass
through
the
groups
of
tourists
.
But
Mr.
Emerson
was
only
half
*NL*
interested
.
He
watched
the
lecturer
,
whose
success
he
believed
he
had
*NL*
impaired
,
and
then
he
anxiously
watched
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
will
he
look
at
that
fresco
?
''
he
said
uneasily
.
``
I
saw
nothing
in
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
Giotto
,
''
she
replied
.
``
It
is
so
wonderful
what
they
say
about
*NL*
his
tactile
values
.
Though
I
like
things
like
the
Della
Robbia
babies
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
ought
.
A
baby
is
worth
a
dozen
saints
.
And
my
baby
's
worth
the
*NL*
whole
of
Paradise
,
and
as
far
as
I
can
see
he
lives
in
Hell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
again
felt
that
this
did
not
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Hell
,
''
he
repeated
.
``
He
's
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
''
said
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
he
be
unhappy
when
he
is
strong
and
alive
?
What
more
is
one
*NL*
to
give
him
?
And
think
how
he
has
been
brought
up
--
free
from
all
the
*NL*
superstition
and
ignorance
that
lead
men
to
hate
one
another
in
the
name
*NL*
of
God
.
With
such
an
education
as
that
,
I
thought
he
was
bound
to
grow
*NL*
up
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
no
theologian
,
but
she
felt
that
here
was
a
very
foolish
old
*NL*
man
,
as
well
as
a
very
irreligious
one
.
She
also
felt
that
her
mother
*NL*
might
not
like
her
talking
to
that
kind
of
person
,
and
that
Charlotte
*NL*
would
object
most
strongly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
we
to
do
with
him
?
''
he
asked
.
``
He
comes
out
for
his
holiday
to
*NL*
Italy
,
and
behaves
--
like
that
;
like
the
little
child
who
ought
to
have
*NL*
been
playing
,
and
who
hurt
himself
upon
the
tombstone
.
Eh
?
What
did
you
*NL*
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
had
made
no
suggestion
.
Suddenly
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
do
n't
be
stupid
over
this
.
I
do
n't
require
you
to
fall
in
love
with
*NL*
my
boy
,
but
I
do
think
you
might
try
and
understand
him
.
You
are
nearer
*NL*
his
age
,
and
if
you
let
yourself
go
I
am
sure
you
are
sensible
.
You
*NL*
might
help
me
.
He
has
known
so
few
women
,
and
you
have
the
time
.
*NL*
You
stop
here
several
weeks
,
I
suppose
?
But
let
yourself
go
.
You
are
*NL*
inclined
to
get
muddled
,
if
I
may
judge
from
last
night
.
Let
yourself
*NL*
go
.
Pull
out
from
the
depths
those
thoughts
that
you
do
not
understand
,
*NL*
and
spread
them
out
in
the
sunlight
and
know
the
meaning
of
them
.
By
*NL*
understanding
George
you
may
learn
to
understand
yourself
.
It
will
be
*NL*
good
for
both
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
extraordinary
speech
Lucy
found
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
know
what
it
is
that
's
wrong
with
him
;
not
why
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
it
?
''
asked
Lucy
fearfully
,
expecting
some
harrowing
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
trouble
;
things
wo
n't
fit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
things
of
the
universe
.
It
is
quite
true
.
They
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Emerson
,
whatever
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
ordinary
voice
,
so
that
she
scarcely
realized
he
was
quoting
*NL*
poetry
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
From
far
,
from
eve
and
morning
,
*NL*
And
yon
twelve-winded
sky
,
*NL*
The
stuff
of
life
to
knit
me
*NL*
Blew
hither
:
here
am
I
'
*NL*
*NL*
George
and
I
both
know
this
,
but
why
does
it
distress
him
?
We
know
that
*NL*
we
come
from
the
winds
,
and
that
we
shall
return
to
them
;
that
all
life
*NL*
is
perhaps
a
knot
,
a
tangle
,
a
blemish
in
the
eternal
smoothness
.
But
*NL*
why
should
this
make
us
unhappy
?
Let
us
rather
love
one
another
,
and
*NL*
work
and
rejoice
.
I
do
n't
believe
in
this
world
sorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Honeychurch
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
make
my
boy
think
like
us
.
Make
him
realize
that
by
the
side
of
*NL*
the
everlasting
Why
there
is
a
Yes
--
a
transitory
Yes
if
you
like
,
but
a
*NL*
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
laughed
;
surely
one
ought
to
laugh
.
A
young
man
melancholy
*NL*
because
the
universe
would
n't
fit
,
because
life
was
a
tangle
or
a
wind
,
*NL*
or
a
Yes
,
or
something
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
sorry
,
''
she
cried
.
``
You
'll
think
me
unfeeling
,
but
--
but
--
''
*NL*
Then
she
became
matronly
.
``
Oh
,
but
your
son
wants
employment
.
Has
he
no
*NL*
particular
hobby
?
Why
,
I
myself
have
worries
,
but
I
can
generally
forget
*NL*
them
at
the
piano
;
and
collecting
stamps
did
no
end
of
good
for
my
*NL*
brother
.
Perhaps
Italy
bores
him
;
you
ought
to
try
the
Alps
or
the
*NL*
Lakes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
's
face
saddened
,
and
he
touched
her
gently
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
This
did
not
alarm
her
;
she
thought
that
her
advice
had
impressed
him
*NL*
and
that
he
was
thanking
her
for
it
.
Indeed
,
he
no
longer
alarmed
her
*NL*
at
all
;
she
regarded
him
as
a
kind
thing
,
but
quite
silly
.
Her
feelings
*NL*
were
as
inflated
spiritually
as
they
had
been
an
hour
ago
esthetically
,
*NL*
before
she
lost
Baedeker
.
The
dear
George
,
now
striding
towards
them
*NL*
over
the
tombstones
,
seemed
both
pitiable
and
absurd
.
He
approached
,
his
*NL*
face
in
the
shadow
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Bartlett
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
good
gracious
me
!
''
said
Lucy
,
suddenly
collapsing
and
again
seeing
*NL*
the
whole
of
life
in
a
new
perspective
.
``
Where
?
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
nave

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see

Those
gossiping
little
Miss
Alans

She
checked
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
girl
!
''
exploded
Mr.
Emerson
.
``
Poor
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
let
this
pass
,
for
it
was
just
what
she
was
feeling
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
girl
?
I
fail
to
understand
the
point
of
that
remark

I
think
*NL*
myself

fortunate

I
assure
you

I
'm
thoroughly
happy

There
's

enough
sorrow

without
trying
to
invent
it

*NL*
Good-bye

Thank
you
both
so
much
for
all
your
kindness

Ah
,
yes

Chapter

:
Music
,
Violets
,
and
the
Letter
``

*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
Lucy
,
who
found
daily
life
rather
chaotic
,
entered
*NL*
a
more
solid
world
when
she
opened
the
piano
.
She
was
then
no
longer
*NL*
either
deferential
or
patronizing
;
no
longer
either
a
rebel
or
a
slave
.
*NL*
The
kingdom
of
music
is
not
the
kingdom
of
this
world
;
it
will
accept
*NL*
those
whom
breeding
and
intellect
and
culture
have
alike
rejected
.
The
*NL*
commonplace
person
begins
to
play
,
and
shoots
into
the
empyrean
without
*NL*
effort
,
whilst
we
look
up
,
marvelling
how
he
has
escaped
us
,
and
*NL*
thinking
how
we
could
worship
him
and
love
him
,
would
he
but
translate
*NL*
his
visions
into
human
words
,
and
his
experiences
into
human
actions
.
*NL*
Perhaps
he
can
not
;
certainly
he
does
not
,
or
does
so
very
seldom
.
Lucy
*NL*
had
done
so
never
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
no
dazzling
executante
;
her
runs
were
not
at
all
like
strings
of
*NL*
pearls
,
and
she
struck
no
more
right
notes
than
was
suitable
for
one
*NL*
of
her
age
and
situation
.
Nor
was
she
the
passionate
young
lady
,
who
*NL*
performs
so
tragically
on
a
summer
's
evening
with
the
window
open
.
*NL*
Passion
was
there
,
but
it
could
not
be
easily
labelled
;
it
slipped
*NL*
between
love
and
hatred
and
jealousy
,
and
all
the
furniture
of
the
*NL*
pictorial
style
.
And
she
was
tragical
only
in
the
sense
that
she
was
*NL*
great
,
for
she
loved
to
play
on
the
side
of
Victory
.
Victory
of
what
and
*NL*
over
what
--
that
is
more
than
the
words
of
daily
life
can
tell
us
.
But
*NL*
that
some
sonatas
of
Beethoven
are
written
tragic
no
one
can
gainsay
;
*NL*
yet
they
can
triumph
or
despair
as
the
player
decides
,
and
Lucy
had
*NL*
decided
that
they
should
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
wet
afternoon
at
the
Bertolini
permitted
her
to
do
the
thing
she
*NL*
really
liked
,
and
after
lunch
she
opened
the
little
draped
piano
.
A
few
*NL*
people
lingered
round
and
praised
her
playing
,
but
finding
that
she
*NL*
made
no
reply
,
dispersed
to
their
rooms
to
write
up
their
diaries
or
*NL*
to
sleep
.
She
took
no
notice
of
Mr.
Emerson
looking
for
his
son
,
nor
of
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
looking
for
Miss
Lavish
,
nor
of
Miss
Lavish
looking
for
*NL*
her
cigarette-case
.
Like
every
true
performer
,
she
was
intoxicated
by
*NL*
the
mere
feel
of
the
notes
:
they
were
fingers
caressing
her
own
;
and
by
*NL*
touch
,
not
by
sound
alone
,
did
she
come
to
her
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
,
sitting
unnoticed
in
the
window
,
pondered
this
illogical
*NL*
element
in
Miss
Honeychurch
,
and
recalled
the
occasion
at
Tunbridge
*NL*
Wells
when
he
had
discovered
it
.
It
was
at
one
of
those
entertainments
*NL*
where
the
upper
classes
entertain
the
lower
.
The
seats
were
filled
with
*NL*
a
respectful
audience
,
and
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
parish
,
under
*NL*
the
auspices
of
their
vicar
,
sang
,
or
recited
,
or
imitated
the
drawing
*NL*
of
a
champagne
cork
.
Among
the
promised
items
was
``
Miss
Honeychurch
.
*NL*
Piano
.
Beethoven
,
''
and
Mr.
Beebe
was
wondering
whether
it
would
be
*NL*
Adelaida
,
or
the
march
of
The
Ruins
of
Athens
,
when
his
composure
*NL*
was
disturbed
by
the
opening
bars
of
Opus
III
.
He
was
in
suspense
all
*NL*
through
the
introduction
,
for
not
until
the
pace
quickens
does
one
know
*NL*
what
the
performer
intends
.
With
the
roar
of
the
opening
theme
he
knew
*NL*
that
things
were
going
extraordinarily
;
in
the
chords
that
herald
the
*NL*
conclusion
he
heard
the
hammer
strokes
of
victory
.
He
was
glad
that
she
*NL*
only
played
the
first
movement
,
for
he
could
have
paid
no
attention
to
*NL*
the
winding
intricacies
of
the
measures
of
nine-sixteen
.
The
audience
*NL*
clapped
,
no
less
respectful
.
It
was
Mr.
Beebe
who
started
the
stamping
;
*NL*
it
was
all
that
one
could
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
she
?
''
he
asked
the
vicar
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cousin
of
one
of
my
parishioners
.
I
do
not
consider
her
choice
of
a
*NL*
piece
happy
.
Beethoven
is
so
usually
simple
and
direct
in
his
appeal
*NL*
that
it
is
sheer
perversity
to
choose
a
thing
like
that
,
which
,
if
*NL*
anything
,
disturbs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Introduce
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
be
delighted
.
She
and
Miss
Bartlett
are
full
of
the
praises
of
*NL*
your
sermon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sermon
?
''
cried
Mr.
Beebe
.
``
Why
ever
did
she
listen
to
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
introduced
he
understood
why
,
for
Miss
Honeychurch
,
*NL*
disjoined
from
her
music
stool
,
was
only
a
young
lady
with
a
quantity
of
*NL*
dark
hair
and
a
very
pretty
,
pale
,
undeveloped
face
.
She
loved
going
to
*NL*
concerts
,
she
loved
stopping
with
her
cousin
,
she
loved
iced
coffee
and
*NL*
meringues
.
He
did
not
doubt
that
she
loved
his
sermon
also
.
But
before
*NL*
he
left
Tunbridge
Wells
he
made
a
remark
to
the
vicar
,
which
he
now
*NL*
made
to
Lucy
herself
when
she
closed
the
little
piano
and
moved
dreamily
*NL*
towards
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Miss
Honeychurch
ever
takes
to
live
as
she
plays
,
it
will
be
very
*NL*
exciting
both
for
us
and
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
at
once
re-entered
daily
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
funny
thing
!
Some
one
said
just
the
same
to
mother
,
and
she
*NL*
said
she
trusted
I
should
never
live
a
duet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
Mrs.
Honeychurch
like
music
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
mind
it
.
But
she
does
n't
like
one
to
get
excited
over
*NL*
anything
;
she
thinks
I
am
silly
about
it
.
She
thinks
--
I
ca
n't
make
*NL*
out
.
Once
,
you
know
,
I
said
that
I
liked
my
own
playing
better
than
any
*NL*
one
's
.
She
has
never
got
over
it
.
Of
course
,
I
did
n't
mean
that
I
played
*NL*
well
;
I
only
meant
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
he
,
wondering
why
she
bothered
to
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Music
--
''
said
Lucy
,
as
if
attempting
some
generality
.
She
could
not
*NL*
complete
it
,
and
looked
out
absently
upon
Italy
in
the
wet
.
The
whole
*NL*
life
of
the
South
was
disorganized
,
and
the
most
graceful
nation
in
*NL*
Europe
had
turned
into
formless
lumps
of
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
street
and
the
river
were
dirty
yellow
,
the
bridge
was
dirty
grey
,
*NL*
and
the
hills
were
dirty
purple
.
Somewhere
in
their
folds
were
concealed
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
and
Miss
Bartlett
,
who
had
chosen
this
afternoon
to
visit
*NL*
the
Torre
del
Gallo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
music
?
''
said
Mr.
Beebe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Charlotte
will
be
sopped
,
''
was
Lucy
's
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
expedition
was
typical
of
Miss
Bartlett
,
who
would
return
cold
,
*NL*
tired
,
hungry
,
and
angelic
,
with
a
ruined
skirt
,
a
pulpy
Baedeker
,
and
*NL*
a
tickling
cough
in
her
throat
.
On
another
day
,
when
the
whole
world
was
*NL*
singing
and
the
air
ran
into
the
mouth
,
like
wine
,
she
would
refuse
to
*NL*
stir
from
the
drawing-room
,
saying
that
she
was
an
old
thing
,
and
no
fit
*NL*
companion
for
a
hearty
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Lavish
has
led
your
cousin
astray
.
She
hopes
to
find
the
true
*NL*
Italy
in
the
wet
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Lavish
is
so
original
,
''
murmured
Lucy
.
This
was
a
stock
remark
,
*NL*
the
supreme
achievement
of
the
Pension
Bertolini
in
the
way
of
*NL*
definition
.
Miss
Lavish
was
so
original
.
Mr.
Beebe
had
his
doubts
,
but
*NL*
they
would
have
been
put
down
to
clerical
narrowness
.
For
that
,
and
for
*NL*
other
reasons
,
he
held
his
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
true
,
''
continued
Lucy
in
awe-struck
tone
,
``
that
Miss
Lavish
is
*NL*
writing
a
book
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
a
novel
,
''
replied
Mr.
Beebe
,
``
dealing
with
modern
Italy
.
*NL*
Let
me
refer
you
for
an
account
to
Miss
Catharine
Alan
,
who
uses
words
*NL*
herself
more
admirably
than
any
one
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
Miss
Lavish
would
tell
me
herself
.
We
started
such
friends
.
But
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
she
ought
to
have
run
away
with
Baedeker
that
morning
in
*NL*
Santa
Croce
.
Charlotte
was
most
annoyed
at
finding
me
practically
alone
,
*NL*
and
so
I
could
n't
help
being
a
little
annoyed
with
Miss
Lavish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
two
ladies
,
at
all
events
,
have
made
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
interested
in
the
sudden
friendship
between
women
so
apparently
*NL*
dissimilar
as
Miss
Bartlett
and
Miss
Lavish
.
They
were
always
in
each
*NL*
other
's
company
,
with
Lucy
a
slighted
third
.
Miss
Lavish
he
believed
*NL*
he
understood
,
but
Miss
Bartlett
might
reveal
unknown
depths
of
*NL*
strangeness
,
though
not
perhaps
,
of
meaning
.
Was
Italy
deflecting
*NL*
her
from
the
path
of
prim
chaperon
,
which
he
had
assigned
to
her
at
*NL*
Tunbridge
Wells
?
All
his
life
he
had
loved
to
study
maiden
ladies
;
*NL*
they
were
his
specialty
,
and
his
profession
had
provided
him
with
ample
*NL*
opportunities
for
the
work
.
Girls
like
Lucy
were
charming
to
look
at
,
*NL*
but
Mr.
Beebe
was
,
from
rather
profound
reasons
,
somewhat
chilly
in
his
*NL*
attitude
towards
the
other
sex
,
and
preferred
to
be
interested
rather
*NL*
than
enthralled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
,
for
the
third
time
,
said
that
poor
Charlotte
would
be
sopped
.
The
*NL*
Arno
was
rising
in
flood
,
washing
away
the
traces
of
the
little
carts
*NL*
upon
the
foreshore
.
But
in
the
south-west
there
had
appeared
a
dull
haze
*NL*
of
yellow
,
which
might
mean
better
weather
if
it
did
not
mean
worse
.
She
*NL*
opened
the
window
to
inspect
,
and
a
cold
blast
entered
the
room
,
drawing
*NL*
a
plaintive
cry
from
Miss
Catharine
Alan
,
who
entered
at
the
same
moment
*NL*
by
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
Miss
Honeychurch
,
you
will
catch
a
chill
!
And
Mr.
Beebe
here
*NL*
besides
.
Who
would
suppose
this
is
Italy
?
There
is
my
sister
actually
*NL*
nursing
the
hot-water
can
;
no
comforts
or
proper
provisions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sidled
towards
them
and
sat
down
,
self-conscious
as
she
always
was
*NL*
on
entering
a
room
which
contained
one
man
,
or
a
man
and
one
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
hear
your
beautiful
playing
,
Miss
Honeychurch
,
though
I
was
in
*NL*
my
room
with
the
door
shut
.
Doors
shut
;
indeed
,
most
necessary
.
No
one
*NL*
has
the
least
idea
of
privacy
in
this
country
.
And
one
person
catches
it
*NL*
from
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
answered
suitably
.
Mr.
Beebe
was
not
able
to
tell
the
ladies
of
*NL*
his
adventure
at
Modena
,
where
the
chambermaid
burst
in
upon
him
in
his
*NL*
bath
,
exclaiming
cheerfully
,
``
Fa
niente
,
sono
vecchia
.
''
He
contented
*NL*
himself
with
saying
:
``
I
quite
agree
with
you
,
Miss
Alan
.
The
Italians
*NL*
are
a
most
unpleasant
people
.
They
pry
everywhere
,
they
see
everything
,
*NL*
and
they
know
what
we
want
before
we
know
it
ourselves
.
We
are
at
their
*NL*
mercy
.
They
read
our
thoughts
,
they
foretell
our
desires
.
From
the
*NL*
cab-driver
down
to
--
to
Giotto
,
they
turn
us
inside
out
,
and
I
resent
*NL*
it
.
Yet
in
their
heart
of
hearts
they
are
--
how
superficial
!
They
have
no
*NL*
conception
of
the
intellectual
life
.
How
right
is
Signora
Bertolini
,
who
*NL*
exclaimed
to
me
the
other
day
:
`
Ho
,
Mr.
Beebe
,
if
you
knew
what
I
suffer
*NL*
over
the
children
's
edjucaishion
.
HI
wo
n't
`
ave
my
little
Victorier
*NL*
taught
by
a
hignorant
Italian
what
ca
n't
explain
nothink
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Alan
did
not
follow
,
but
gathered
that
she
was
being
mocked
in
an
*NL*
agreeable
way
.
Her
sister
was
a
little
disappointed
in
Mr.
Beebe
,
having
*NL*
expected
better
things
from
a
clergyman
whose
head
was
bald
and
who
*NL*
wore
a
pair
of
russet
whiskers
.
Indeed
,
who
would
have
supposed
that
*NL*
tolerance
,
sympathy
,
and
a
sense
of
humour
would
inhabit
that
militant
*NL*
form
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
her
satisfaction
she
continued
to
sidle
,
and
at
last
*NL*
the
cause
was
disclosed
.
From
the
chair
beneath
her
she
extracted
*NL*
a
gun-metal
cigarette-case
,
on
which
were
powdered
in
turquoise
the
*NL*
initials
``
E.
L.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
belongs
to
Lavish
.
''
said
the
clergyman
.
``
A
good
fellow
,
Lavish
,
*NL*
but
I
wish
she
'd
start
a
pipe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Beebe
,
''
said
Miss
Alan
,
divided
between
awe
and
mirth
.
``
Indeed
,
*NL*
though
it
is
dreadful
for
her
to
smoke
,
it
is
not
quite
as
dreadful
as
*NL*
you
suppose
.
She
took
to
it
,
practically
in
despair
,
after
her
*NL*
life
's
work
was
carried
away
in
a
landslip
.
Surely
that
makes
it
more
*NL*
excusable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
that
?
''
asked
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
sat
back
complacently
,
and
Miss
Alan
began
as
follows
:
``
It
was
*NL*
a
novel
--
and
I
am
afraid
,
from
what
I
can
gather
,
not
a
very
nice
novel
.
*NL*
It
is
so
sad
when
people
who
have
abilities
misuse
them
,
and
I
must
say
*NL*
they
nearly
always
do
.
Anyhow
,
she
left
it
almost
finished
in
the
Grotto
*NL*
of
the
Calvary
at
the
Capuccini
Hotel
at
Amalfi
while
she
went
for
a
*NL*
little
ink
.
She
said
:
`
Can
I
have
a
little
ink
,
please
?
'
But
you
know
*NL*
what
Italians
are
,
and
meanwhile
the
Grotto
fell
roaring
on
to
the
*NL*
beach
,
and
the
saddest
thing
of
all
is
that
she
can
not
remember
what
she
*NL*
has
written
.
The
poor
thing
was
very
ill
after
it
,
and
so
got
tempted
*NL*
into
cigarettes
.
It
is
a
great
secret
,
but
I
am
glad
to
say
that
she
is
*NL*
writing
another
novel
.
She
told
Teresa
and
Miss
Pole
the
other
day
that
*NL*
she
had
got
up
all
the
local
colour
--
this
novel
is
to
be
about
modern
*NL*
Italy
;
the
other
was
historical
--
but
that
she
could
not
start
till
she
*NL*
had
an
idea
.
First
she
tried
Perugia
for
an
inspiration
,
then
she
came
*NL*
here
--
this
must
on
no
account
get
round
.
And
so
cheerful
through
it
all
!
*NL*
I
can
not
help
thinking
that
there
is
something
to
admire
in
everyone
,
*NL*
even
if
you
do
not
approve
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Alan
was
always
thus
being
charitable
against
her
better
judgement
.
*NL*
A
delicate
pathos
perfumed
her
disconnected
remarks
,
giving
them
*NL*
unexpected
beauty
,
just
as
in
the
decaying
autumn
woods
there
sometimes
*NL*
rise
odours
reminiscent
of
spring
.
She
felt
she
had
made
almost
too
many
*NL*
allowances
,
and
apologized
hurriedly
for
her
toleration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
,
she
is
a
little
too
--
I
hardly
like
to
say
unwomanly
,
but
*NL*
she
behaved
most
strangely
when
the
Emersons
arrived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
smiled
as
Miss
Alan
plunged
into
an
anecdote
which
he
knew
she
*NL*
would
be
unable
to
finish
in
the
presence
of
a
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
Miss
Honeychurch
,
if
you
have
noticed
that
Miss
Pole
,
the
*NL*
lady
who
has
so
much
yellow
hair
,
takes
lemonade
.
That
old
Mr.
Emerson
,
*NL*
who
puts
things
very
strangely
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
jaw
dropped
.
She
was
silent
.
Mr.
Beebe
,
whose
social
resources
were
*NL*
endless
,
went
out
to
order
some
tea
,
and
she
continued
to
Lucy
in
a
*NL*
hasty
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stomach
.
He
warned
Miss
Pole
of
her
stomach-acidity
,
he
called
it
--
and
*NL*
he
may
have
meant
to
be
kind
.
I
must
say
I
forgot
myself
and
laughed
;
it
*NL*
was
so
sudden
.
As
Teresa
truly
said
,
it
was
no
laughing
matter
.
But
the
*NL*
point
is
that
Miss
Lavish
was
positively
ATTRACTED
by
his
mentioning
*NL*
S.
,
and
said
she
liked
plain
speaking
,
and
meeting
different
grades
of
*NL*
thought
.
She
thought
they
were
commercial
travellers
--
`
drummers
'
was
the
*NL*
word
she
used
--
and
all
through
dinner
she
tried
to
prove
that
England
,
*NL*
our
great
and
beloved
country
,
rests
on
nothing
but
commerce
.
Teresa
was
*NL*
very
much
annoyed
,
and
left
the
table
before
the
cheese
,
saying
as
she
*NL*
did
so
:
`
There
,
Miss
Lavish
,
is
one
who
can
confute
you
better
than
I
,
'
*NL*
and
pointed
to
that
beautiful
picture
of
Lord
Tennyson
.
Then
Miss
*NL*
Lavish
said
:
`
Tut
!
The
early
Victorians
.
'
Just
imagine
!
`
Tut
!
The
early
*NL*
Victorians
.
'
My
sister
had
gone
,
and
I
felt
bound
to
speak
.
I
said
:
*NL*
`
Miss
Lavish
,
I
am
an
early
Victorian
;
at
least
,
that
is
to
say
,
I
*NL*
will
hear
no
breath
of
censure
against
our
dear
Queen
.
'
It
was
horrible
*NL*
speaking
.
I
reminded
her
how
the
Queen
had
been
to
Ireland
when
she
did
*NL*
not
want
to
go
,
and
I
must
say
she
was
dumbfounded
,
and
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
But
,
unluckily
,
Mr.
Emerson
overheard
this
part
,
and
called
in
his
deep
*NL*
voice
:
`
Quite
so
,
quite
so
!
I
honour
the
woman
for
her
Irish
visit
.
'
The
*NL*
woman
!
I
tell
things
so
badly
;
but
you
see
what
a
tangle
we
were
in
*NL*
by
this
time
,
all
on
account
of
S.
having
been
mentioned
in
the
first
*NL*
place
.
But
that
was
not
all
.
After
dinner
Miss
Lavish
actually
came
up
*NL*
and
said
:
`
Miss
Alan
,
I
am
going
into
the
smoking-room
to
talk
to
those
*NL*
two
nice
men
.
Come
,
too
.
'
Needless
to
say
,
I
refused
such
an
unsuitable
*NL*
invitation
,
and
she
had
the
impertinence
to
tell
me
that
it
would
*NL*
broaden
my
ideas
,
and
said
that
she
had
four
brothers
,
all
University
*NL*
men
,
except
one
who
was
in
the
army
,
who
always
made
a
point
of
talking
*NL*
to
commercial
travellers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
finish
the
story
,
''
said
Mr.
Beebe
,
who
had
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Lavish
tried
Miss
Pole
,
myself
,
everyone
,
and
finally
said
:
*NL*
'
I
shall
go
alone
.
'
She
went
.
At
the
end
of
five
minutes
she
returned
*NL*
unobtrusively
with
a
green
baize
board
,
and
began
playing
patience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
happened
?
''
cried
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
knows
.
No
one
will
ever
know
.
Miss
Lavish
will
never
dare
to
*NL*
tell
,
and
Mr.
Emerson
does
not
think
it
worth
telling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Beebe
--
old
Mr.
Emerson
,
is
he
nice
or
not
nice
?
I
do
so
want
to
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
laughed
and
suggested
that
she
should
settle
the
question
for
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
it
is
so
difficult
.
Sometimes
he
is
so
silly
,
and
then
I
do
not
*NL*
mind
him
.
Miss
Alan
,
what
do
you
think
?
Is
he
nice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
old
lady
shook
her
head
,
and
sighed
disapprovingly
.
Mr.
*NL*
Beebe
,
whom
the
conversation
amused
,
stirred
her
up
by
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consider
that
you
are
bound
to
class
him
as
nice
,
Miss
Alan
,
after
*NL*
that
business
of
the
violets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Violets
?
Oh
,
dear
!
Who
told
you
about
the
violets
?
How
do
things
get
*NL*
round
?
A
pension
is
a
bad
place
for
gossips
.
No
,
I
can
not
forget
how
*NL*
they
behaved
at
Mr.
Eager
's
lecture
at
Santa
Croce
.
Oh
,
poor
Miss
*NL*
Honeychurch
!
It
really
was
too
bad
.
No
,
I
have
quite
changed
.
I
do
NOT
*NL*
like
the
Emersons
.
They
are
not
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
smiled
nonchalantly
.
He
had
made
a
gentle
effort
to
introduce
*NL*
the
Emersons
into
Bertolini
society
,
and
the
effort
had
failed
.
He
was
*NL*
almost
the
only
person
who
remained
friendly
to
them
.
Miss
Lavish
,
who
*NL*
represented
intellect
,
was
avowedly
hostile
,
and
now
the
Miss
Alans
,
*NL*
who
stood
for
good
breeding
,
were
following
her
.
Miss
Bartlett
,
smarting
*NL*
under
an
obligation
,
would
scarcely
be
civil
.
The
case
of
Lucy
was
*NL*
different
.
She
had
given
him
a
hazy
account
of
her
adventures
in
Santa
*NL*
Croce
,
and
he
gathered
that
the
two
men
had
made
a
curious
and
possibly
*NL*
concerted
attempt
to
annex
her
,
to
show
her
the
world
from
their
own
*NL*
strange
standpoint
,
to
interest
her
in
their
private
sorrows
and
joys
.
*NL*
This
was
impertinent
;
he
did
not
wish
their
cause
to
be
championed
by
a
*NL*
young
girl
:
he
would
rather
it
should
fail
.
After
all
,
he
knew
nothing
*NL*
about
them
,
and
pension
joys
,
pension
sorrows
,
are
flimsy
things
;
*NL*
whereas
Lucy
would
be
his
parishioner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
,
with
one
eye
upon
the
weather
,
finally
said
that
she
thought
the
*NL*
Emersons
were
nice
;
not
that
she
saw
anything
of
them
now
.
Even
their
*NL*
seats
at
dinner
had
been
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
are
n't
they
always
waylaying
you
to
go
out
with
them
,
dear
?
''
said
*NL*
the
little
lady
inquisitively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
once
.
Charlotte
did
n't
like
it
,
and
said
something
--
quite
*NL*
politely
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
right
of
her
.
They
do
n't
understand
our
ways
.
They
must
find
their
*NL*
level
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
rather
felt
that
they
had
gone
under
.
They
had
given
up
their
*NL*
attempt
--
if
it
was
one
--
to
conquer
society
,
and
now
the
father
was
*NL*
almost
as
silent
as
the
son
.
He
wondered
whether
he
would
not
plan
a
*NL*
pleasant
day
for
these
folk
before
they
left
--
some
expedition
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
with
Lucy
well
chaperoned
to
be
nice
to
them
.
It
was
one
of
Mr.
Beebe
's
*NL*
chief
pleasures
to
provide
people
with
happy
memories
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
approached
while
they
chatted
;
the
air
became
brighter
;
the
*NL*
colours
on
the
trees
and
hills
were
purified
,
and
the
Arno
lost
its
*NL*
muddy
solidity
and
began
to
twinkle
.
There
were
a
few
streaks
of
*NL*
bluish-green
among
the
clouds
,
a
few
patches
of
watery
light
upon
the
*NL*
earth
,
and
then
the
dripping
facade
of
San
Miniato
shone
brilliantly
in
*NL*
the
declining
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
late
to
go
out
,
''
said
Miss
Alan
in
a
voice
of
relief
.
``
All
the
*NL*
galleries
are
shut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
shall
go
out
,
''
said
Lucy
.
``
I
want
to
go
round
the
town
in
the
*NL*
circular
tram
--
on
the
platform
by
the
driver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
two
companions
looked
grave
.
Mr.
Beebe
,
who
felt
responsible
for
her
*NL*
in
the
absence
of
Miss
Bartlett
,
ventured
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
we
could
.
Unluckily
I
have
letters
.
If
you
do
want
to
go
out
*NL*
alone
,
wo
n't
you
be
better
on
your
feet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Italians
,
dear
,
you
know
,
''
said
Miss
Alan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
shall
meet
someone
who
reads
me
through
and
through
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
still
looked
disapproval
,
and
she
so
far
conceded
to
Mr.
Beebe
*NL*
as
to
say
that
she
would
only
go
for
a
little
walk
,
and
keep
to
the
*NL*
street
frequented
by
tourists
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ought
n't
really
to
go
at
all
,
''
said
Mr.
Beebe
,
as
they
watched
*NL*
her
from
the
window
,
``
and
she
knows
it
.
I
put
it
down
to
too
much
*NL*
Beethoven
.
''
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
IV
:
Fourth
Chapter
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
was
right
.
Lucy
never
knew
her
desires
so
clearly
as
after
*NL*
music
.
She
had
not
really
appreciated
the
clergyman
's
wit
,
nor
the
*NL*
suggestive
twitterings
of
Miss
Alan
.
Conversation
was
tedious
;
she
*NL*
wanted
something
big
,
and
she
believed
that
it
would
have
come
to
her
on
*NL*
the
wind-swept
platform
of
an
electric
tram
.
This
she
might
not
attempt
.
*NL*
It
was
unladylike
.
Why
?
Why
were
most
big
things
unladylike
?
Charlotte
*NL*
had
once
explained
to
her
why
.
It
was
not
that
ladies
were
inferior
*NL*
to
men
;
it
was
that
they
were
different
.
Their
mission
was
to
inspire
*NL*
others
to
achievement
rather
than
to
achieve
themselves
.
Indirectly
,
by
*NL*
means
of
tact
and
a
spotless
name
,
a
lady
could
accomplish
much
.
But
*NL*
if
she
rushed
into
the
fray
herself
she
would
be
first
censured
,
then
*NL*
despised
,
and
finally
ignored
.
Poems
had
been
written
to
illustrate
this
*NL*
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
much
that
is
immortal
in
this
medieval
lady
.
The
dragons
have
*NL*
gone
,
and
so
have
the
knights
,
but
still
she
lingers
in
our
midst
.
She
*NL*
reigned
in
many
an
early
Victorian
castle
,
and
was
Queen
of
much
early
*NL*
Victorian
song
.
It
is
sweet
to
protect
her
in
the
intervals
of
business
,
*NL*
sweet
to
pay
her
honour
when
she
has
cooked
our
dinner
well
.
But
alas
!
*NL*
the
creature
grows
degenerate
.
In
her
heart
also
there
are
springing
*NL*
up
strange
desires
.
She
too
is
enamoured
of
heavy
winds
,
and
vast
*NL*
panoramas
,
and
green
expanses
of
the
sea
.
She
has
marked
the
kingdom
*NL*
of
this
world
,
how
full
it
is
of
wealth
,
and
beauty
,
and
war
--
a
radiant
*NL*
crust
,
built
around
the
central
fires
,
spinning
towards
the
receding
*NL*
heavens
.
Men
,
declaring
that
she
inspires
them
to
it
,
move
joyfully
over
*NL*
the
surface
,
having
the
most
delightful
meetings
with
other
men
,
happy
,
*NL*
not
because
they
are
masculine
,
but
because
they
are
alive
.
Before
the
*NL*
show
breaks
up
she
would
like
to
drop
the
august
title
of
the
Eternal
*NL*
Woman
,
and
go
there
as
her
transitory
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
does
not
stand
for
the
medieval
lady
,
who
was
rather
an
ideal
to
*NL*
which
she
was
bidden
to
lift
her
eyes
when
feeling
serious
.
Nor
has
*NL*
she
any
system
of
revolt
.
Here
and
there
a
restriction
annoyed
her
*NL*
particularly
,
and
she
would
transgress
it
,
and
perhaps
be
sorry
that
she
*NL*
had
done
so
.
This
afternoon
she
was
peculiarly
restive
.
She
would
really
*NL*
like
to
do
something
of
which
her
well-wishers
disapproved
.
As
she
might
*NL*
not
go
on
the
electric
tram
,
she
went
to
Alinari
's
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
she
bought
a
photograph
of
Botticelli
's
``
Birth
of
Venus
.
''
Venus
,
*NL*
being
a
pity
,
spoilt
the
picture
,
otherwise
so
charming
,
and
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
had
persuaded
her
to
do
without
it
.
-LRB-
A
pity
in
art
of
course
*NL*
signified
the
nude
.
-RRB-
Giorgione
's
``
Tempesta
,
''
the
``
Idolino
,
''
some
of
*NL*
the
Sistine
frescoes
and
the
Apoxyomenos
,
were
added
to
it
.
She
felt
*NL*
a
little
calmer
then
,
and
bought
Fra
Angelico
's
``
Coronation
,
''
Giotto
's
*NL*
``
Ascension
of
St.
John
,
''
some
Della
Robbia
babies
,
and
some
Guido
*NL*
Reni
Madonnas
.
For
her
taste
was
catholic
,
and
she
extended
uncritical
*NL*
approval
to
every
well-known
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
she
spent
nearly
seven
lire
,
the
gates
of
liberty
seemed
*NL*
still
unopened
.
She
was
conscious
of
her
discontent
;
it
was
new
to
her
*NL*
to
be
conscious
of
it
.
``
The
world
,
''
she
thought
,
``
is
certainly
full
*NL*
of
beautiful
things
,
if
only
I
could
come
across
them
.
''
It
was
not
*NL*
surprising
that
Mrs.
Honeychurch
disapproved
of
music
,
declaring
that
it
*NL*
always
left
her
daughter
peevish
,
unpractical
,
and
touchy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
ever
happens
to
me
,
''
she
reflected
,
as
she
entered
the
Piazza
*NL*
Signoria
and
looked
nonchalantly
at
its
marvels
,
now
fairly
familiar
to
*NL*
her
.
The
great
square
was
in
shadow
;
the
sunshine
had
come
too
late
to
*NL*
strike
it
.
Neptune
was
already
unsubstantial
in
the
twilight
,
half
god
,
*NL*
half
ghost
,
and
his
fountain
plashed
dreamily
to
the
men
and
satyrs
who
*NL*
idled
together
on
its
marge
.
The
Loggia
showed
as
the
triple
entrance
of
*NL*
a
cave
,
wherein
many
a
deity
,
shadowy
,
but
immortal
,
looking
forth
*NL*
upon
the
arrivals
and
departures
of
mankind
.
It
was
the
hour
of
*NL*
unreality
--
the
hour
,
that
is
,
when
unfamiliar
things
are
real
.
An
older
*NL*
person
at
such
an
hour
and
in
such
a
place
might
think
that
sufficient
*NL*
was
happening
to
him
,
and
rest
content
.
Lucy
desired
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fixed
her
eyes
wistfully
on
the
tower
of
the
palace
,
which
rose
*NL*
out
of
the
lower
darkness
like
a
pillar
of
roughened
gold
.
It
seemed
*NL*
no
longer
a
tower
,
no
longer
supported
by
earth
,
but
some
unattainable
*NL*
treasure
throbbing
in
the
tranquil
sky
.
Its
brightness
mesmerized
her
,
*NL*
still
dancing
before
her
eyes
when
she
bent
them
to
the
ground
and
*NL*
started
towards
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
something
did
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
Italians
by
the
Loggia
had
been
bickering
about
a
debt
.
``
Cinque
*NL*
lire
,
''
they
had
cried
,
``
cinque
lire
!
''
They
sparred
at
each
other
,
and
*NL*
one
of
them
was
hit
lightly
upon
the
chest
.
He
frowned
;
he
bent
towards
*NL*
Lucy
with
a
look
of
interest
,
as
if
he
had
an
important
message
for
her
.
*NL*
He
opened
his
lips
to
deliver
it
,
and
a
stream
of
red
came
out
between
*NL*
them
and
trickled
down
his
unshaven
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
all
.
A
crowd
rose
out
of
the
dusk
.
It
hid
this
extraordinary
*NL*
man
from
her
,
and
bore
him
away
to
the
fountain
.
Mr.
George
Emerson
*NL*
happened
to
be
a
few
paces
away
,
looking
at
her
across
the
spot
where
*NL*
the
man
had
been
.
How
very
odd
!
Across
something
.
Even
as
she
caught
*NL*
sight
of
him
he
grew
dim
;
the
palace
itself
grew
dim
,
swayed
above
her
,
*NL*
fell
on
to
her
softly
,
slowly
,
noiselessly
,
and
the
sky
fell
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
:
``
Oh
,
what
have
I
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
have
I
done
?
''
she
murmured
,
and
opened
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Emerson
still
looked
at
her
,
but
not
across
anything
.
She
had
*NL*
complained
of
dullness
,
and
lo
!
one
man
was
stabbed
,
and
another
held
*NL*
her
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
sitting
on
some
steps
in
the
Uffizi
Arcade
.
He
must
have
*NL*
carried
her
.
He
rose
when
she
spoke
,
and
began
to
dust
his
knees
.
She
*NL*
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
have
I
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
fainted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
am
very
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
well
--
absolutely
well
.
''
And
she
began
to
nod
and
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
us
come
home
.
There
's
no
point
in
our
stopping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
out
his
hand
to
pull
her
up
.
She
pretended
not
to
see
it
.
The
*NL*
cries
from
the
fountain
--
they
had
never
ceased
--
rang
emptily
.
The
whole
*NL*
world
seemed
pale
and
void
of
its
original
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
kind
you
have
been
!
I
might
have
hurt
myself
falling
.
But
now
*NL*
I
am
well
.
I
can
go
alone
,
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
was
still
extended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
photographs
!
''
she
exclaimed
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
photographs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bought
some
photographs
at
Alinari
's
.
I
must
have
dropped
them
out
*NL*
there
in
the
square
.
''
She
looked
at
him
cautiously
.
``
Would
you
add
to
*NL*
your
kindness
by
fetching
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
added
to
his
kindness
.
As
soon
as
he
had
turned
his
back
,
Lucy
arose
*NL*
with
the
running
of
a
maniac
and
stole
down
the
arcade
towards
the
Arno
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Honeychurch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
with
her
hand
on
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sit
still
;
you
are
n't
fit
to
go
home
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
,
thank
you
so
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
are
n't
.
You
'd
go
openly
if
you
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
had
rather
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
do
n't
fetch
your
photographs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
rather
be
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
imperiously
:
``
The
man
is
dead
--
the
man
is
probably
dead
;
sit
*NL*
down
till
you
are
rested
.
''
She
was
bewildered
,
and
obeyed
him
.
``
And
*NL*
do
n't
move
till
I
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
distance
she
saw
creatures
with
black
hoods
,
such
as
appear
in
*NL*
dreams
.
The
palace
tower
had
lost
the
reflection
of
the
declining
day
,
*NL*
and
joined
itself
to
earth
.
How
should
she
talk
to
Mr.
Emerson
when
he
*NL*
returned
from
the
shadowy
square
?
Again
the
thought
occurred
to
her
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
have
I
done
?
''
--
the
thought
that
she
,
as
well
as
the
dying
man
,
*NL*
had
crossed
some
spiritual
boundary
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
,
and
she
talked
of
the
murder
.
Oddly
enough
,
it
was
an
easy
*NL*
topic
.
She
spoke
of
the
Italian
character
;
she
became
almost
garrulous
*NL*
over
the
incident
that
had
made
her
faint
five
minutes
before
.
Being
*NL*
strong
physically
,
she
soon
overcame
the
horror
of
blood
.
She
rose
*NL*
without
his
assistance
,
and
though
wings
seemed
to
flutter
inside
her
,
*NL*
she
walked
firmly
enough
towards
the
Arno
.
There
a
cabman
signalled
to
*NL*
them
;
they
refused
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
murderer
tried
to
kiss
him
,
you
say
--
how
very
odd
Italians
*NL*
are
!
--
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
police
!
Mr.
Beebe
was
saying
that
*NL*
Italians
know
everything
,
but
I
think
they
are
rather
childish
.
When
my
*NL*
cousin
and
I
were
at
the
Pitti
yesterday
--
What
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
thrown
something
into
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
throw
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
I
did
n't
want
,
''
he
said
crossly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Emerson
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
the
photographs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
was
my
photographs
that
you
threw
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
what
to
do
with
them
,
''
he
cried
,
and
his
voice
was
that
*NL*
of
an
anxious
boy
.
Her
heart
warmed
towards
him
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
``
They
were
covered
with
blood
.
There
!
I
'm
glad
I
've
told
you
;
and
all
*NL*
the
time
we
were
making
conversation
I
was
wondering
what
to
do
with
*NL*
them
.
''
He
pointed
down-stream
.
``
They
've
gone
.
''
The
river
swirled
under
*NL*
the
bridge
,
``
I
did
mind
them
so
,
and
one
is
so
foolish
,
it
seemed
better
*NL*
that
they
should
go
out
to
the
sea
--
I
do
n't
know
;
I
may
just
mean
that
*NL*
they
frightened
me
.
''
Then
the
boy
verged
into
a
man
.
``
For
something
*NL*
tremendous
has
happened
;
I
must
face
it
without
getting
muddled
.
It
*NL*
is
n't
exactly
that
a
man
has
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
warned
Lucy
that
she
must
stop
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
happened
,
''
he
repeated
,
``
and
I
mean
to
find
out
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Emerson
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
towards
her
frowning
,
as
if
she
had
disturbed
him
in
some
*NL*
abstract
quest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
ask
you
something
before
we
go
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
close
to
their
pension
.
She
stopped
and
leant
her
elbows
*NL*
against
the
parapet
of
the
embankment
.
He
did
likewise
.
There
is
at
*NL*
times
a
magic
in
identity
of
position
;
it
is
one
of
the
things
that
have
*NL*
suggested
to
us
eternal
comradeship
.
She
moved
her
elbows
before
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
behaved
ridiculously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
following
his
own
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
never
so
much
ashamed
of
myself
in
my
life
;
I
can
not
think
what
*NL*
came
over
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
nearly
fainted
myself
,
''
he
said
;
but
she
felt
that
her
attitude
*NL*
repelled
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
owe
you
a
thousand
apologies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
--
this
is
the
real
point
--
you
know
how
silly
people
are
*NL*
gossiping
--
ladies
especially
,
I
am
afraid
--
you
understand
what
I
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
would
you
not
mention
it
to
any
one
,
my
foolish
behaviour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
behaviour
?
Oh
,
yes
,
all
right
--
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
so
much
.
And
would
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
carry
her
request
any
further
.
The
river
was
rushing
below
*NL*
them
,
almost
black
in
the
advancing
night
.
He
had
thrown
her
photographs
*NL*
into
it
,
and
then
he
had
told
her
the
reason
.
It
struck
her
that
it
was
*NL*
hopeless
to
look
for
chivalry
in
such
a
man
.
He
would
do
her
no
harm
by
*NL*
idle
gossip
;
he
was
trustworthy
,
intelligent
,
and
even
kind
;
he
might
*NL*
even
have
a
high
opinion
of
her
.
But
he
lacked
chivalry
;
his
thoughts
,
*NL*
like
his
behaviour
,
would
not
be
modified
by
awe
.
It
was
useless
to
say
*NL*
to
him
,
``
And
would
you
--
''
and
hope
that
he
would
complete
the
sentence
*NL*
for
himself
,
averting
his
eyes
from
her
nakedness
like
the
knight
in
*NL*
that
beautiful
picture
.
She
had
been
in
his
arms
,
and
he
remembered
it
,
*NL*
just
as
he
remembered
the
blood
on
the
photographs
that
she
had
bought
*NL*
in
Alinari
's
shop
.
It
was
not
exactly
that
a
man
had
died
;
something
*NL*
had
happened
to
the
living
:
they
had
come
to
a
situation
where
character
*NL*
tells
,
and
where
childhood
enters
upon
the
branching
paths
of
Youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
thank
you
so
much
,
''
she
repeated
,
``
How
quickly
these
accidents
do
*NL*
happen
,
and
then
one
returns
to
the
old
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anxiety
moved
her
to
question
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
answer
was
puzzling
:
``
I
shall
probably
want
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
,
Mr.
Emerson
?
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
want
to
live
,
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leaning
her
elbows
on
the
parapet
,
she
contemplated
the
River
Arno
,
*NL*
whose
roar
was
suggesting
some
unexpected
melody
to
her
ears
.

Chapter

Possibilities
of
a
Pleasant
Outing
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
family
saying
that
``
you
never
knew
which
way
Charlotte
Bartlett
*NL*
would
turn
.
''
She
was
perfectly
pleasant
and
sensible
over
Lucy
's
*NL*
adventure
,
found
the
abridged
account
of
it
quite
adequate
,
and
paid
*NL*
suitable
tribute
to
the
courtesy
of
Mr.
George
Emerson
.
She
and
Miss
*NL*
Lavish
had
had
an
adventure
also
.
They
had
been
stopped
at
the
Dazio
*NL*
coming
back
,
and
the
young
officials
there
,
who
seemed
impudent
and
*NL*
desoeuvre
,
had
tried
to
search
their
reticules
for
provisions
.
It
might
*NL*
have
been
most
unpleasant
.
Fortunately
Miss
Lavish
was
a
match
for
any
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
good
or
for
evil
,
Lucy
was
left
to
face
her
problem
alone
.
None
*NL*
of
her
friends
had
seen
her
,
either
in
the
Piazza
or
,
later
on
,
by
*NL*
the
embankment
.
Mr.
Beebe
,
indeed
,
noticing
her
startled
eyes
at
*NL*
dinner-time
,
had
again
passed
to
himself
the
remark
of
``
Too
much
*NL*
Beethoven
.
''
But
he
only
supposed
that
she
was
ready
for
an
adventure
,
*NL*
not
that
she
had
encountered
it
.
This
solitude
oppressed
her
;
she
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
have
her
thoughts
confirmed
by
others
or
,
at
all
events
,
*NL*
contradicted
;
it
was
too
dreadful
not
to
know
whether
she
was
thinking
*NL*
right
or
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
breakfast
next
morning
she
took
decisive
action
.
There
were
two
plans
*NL*
between
which
she
had
to
choose
.
Mr.
Beebe
was
walking
up
to
the
*NL*
Torre
del
Gallo
with
the
Emersons
and
some
American
ladies
.
Would
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
and
Miss
Honeychurch
join
the
party
?
Charlotte
declined
for
*NL*
herself
;
she
had
been
there
in
the
rain
the
previous
afternoon
.
But
*NL*
she
thought
it
an
admirable
idea
for
Lucy
,
who
hated
shopping
,
changing
*NL*
money
,
fetching
letters
,
and
other
irksome
duties
--
all
of
which
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
must
accomplish
this
morning
and
could
easily
accomplish
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Charlotte
!
''
cried
the
girl
,
with
real
warmth
.
``
It
's
very
kind
of
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
,
but
I
am
certainly
coming
with
you
.
I
had
much
rather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
dear
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
with
a
faint
flush
of
pleasure
*NL*
that
called
forth
a
deep
flush
of
shame
on
the
cheeks
of
Lucy
.
How
*NL*
abominably
she
behaved
to
Charlotte
,
now
as
always
!
But
now
she
should
*NL*
alter
.
All
morning
she
would
be
really
nice
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slipped
her
arm
into
her
cousin
's
,
and
they
started
off
along
the
*NL*
Lung
'
Arno
.
The
river
was
a
lion
that
morning
in
strength
,
voice
,
and
*NL*
colour
.
Miss
Bartlett
insisted
on
leaning
over
the
parapet
to
look
at
*NL*
it
.
She
then
made
her
usual
remark
,
which
was
``
How
I
do
wish
Freddy
and
*NL*
your
mother
could
see
this
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
fidgeted
;
it
was
tiresome
of
Charlotte
to
have
stopped
exactly
*NL*
where
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
Lucia
!
Oh
,
you
are
watching
for
the
Torre
del
Gallo
party
.
I
*NL*
feared
you
would
repent
you
of
your
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Serious
as
the
choice
had
been
,
Lucy
did
not
repent
.
Yesterday
had
been
*NL*
a
muddle
--
queer
and
odd
,
the
kind
of
thing
one
could
not
write
down
*NL*
easily
on
paper
--
but
she
had
a
feeling
that
Charlotte
and
her
shopping
*NL*
were
preferable
to
George
Emerson
and
the
summit
of
the
Torre
del
*NL*
Gallo
.
Since
she
could
not
unravel
the
tangle
,
she
must
take
care
not
*NL*
to
re-enter
it
.
She
could
protest
sincerely
against
Miss
Bartlett
's
*NL*
insinuations
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
she
had
avoided
the
chief
actor
,
the
scenery
unfortunately
*NL*
remained
.
Charlotte
,
with
the
complacency
of
fate
,
led
her
from
the
*NL*
river
to
the
Piazza
Signoria
.
She
could
not
have
believed
that
stones
,
a
*NL*
Loggia
,
a
fountain
,
a
palace
tower
,
would
have
such
significance
.
For
a
*NL*
moment
she
understood
the
nature
of
ghosts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
exact
site
of
the
murder
was
occupied
,
not
by
a
ghost
,
but
by
Miss
*NL*
Lavish
,
who
had
the
morning
newspaper
in
her
hand
.
She
hailed
them
*NL*
briskly
.
The
dreadful
catastrophe
of
the
previous
day
had
given
her
an
*NL*
idea
which
she
thought
would
work
up
into
a
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
me
congratulate
you
!
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
.
``
After
your
despair
*NL*
of
yesterday
!
What
a
fortunate
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
!
Miss
Honeychurch
,
come
you
here
I
am
in
luck
.
Now
,
you
are
to
tell
*NL*
me
absolutely
everything
that
you
saw
from
the
beginning
.
''
Lucy
poked
at
*NL*
the
ground
with
her
parasol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
you
would
rather
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
--
if
you
could
manage
without
it
,
I
think
I
would
rather
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
ladies
exchanged
glances
,
not
of
disapproval
;
it
is
suitable
*NL*
that
a
girl
should
feel
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
who
am
sorry
,
''
said
Miss
Lavish
``
literary
hacks
are
shameless
*NL*
creatures
.
I
believe
there
's
no
secret
of
the
human
heart
into
which
we
*NL*
would
n't
pry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
marched
cheerfully
to
the
fountain
and
back
,
and
did
a
few
*NL*
calculations
in
realism
.
Then
she
said
that
she
had
been
in
the
*NL*
Piazza
since
eight
o'clock
collecting
material
.
A
good
deal
of
it
was
*NL*
unsuitable
,
but
of
course
one
always
had
to
adapt
.
The
two
men
had
*NL*
quarrelled
over
a
five-franc
note
.
For
the
five-franc
note
she
should
*NL*
substitute
a
young
lady
,
which
would
raise
the
tone
of
the
tragedy
,
and
*NL*
at
the
same
time
furnish
an
excellent
plot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
heroine
's
name
?
''
asked
Miss
Bartlett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leonora
,
''
said
Miss
Lavish
;
her
own
name
was
Eleanor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
hope
she
's
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
desideratum
would
not
be
omitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
the
plot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Love
,
murder
,
abduction
,
revenge
,
was
the
plot
.
But
it
all
came
while
*NL*
the
fountain
plashed
to
the
satyrs
in
the
morning
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
will
excuse
me
for
boring
on
like
this
,
''
Miss
Lavish
*NL*
concluded
.
``
It
is
so
tempting
to
talk
to
really
sympathetic
people
.
*NL*
Of
course
,
this
is
the
barest
outline
.
There
will
be
a
deal
of
local
*NL*
colouring
,
descriptions
of
Florence
and
the
neighbourhood
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
also
introduce
some
humorous
characters
.
And
let
me
give
you
all
fair
*NL*
warning
:
I
intend
to
be
unmerciful
to
the
British
tourist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
wicked
woman
,
''
cried
Miss
Bartlett
.
``
I
am
sure
you
are
thinking
*NL*
of
the
Emersons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
gave
a
Machiavellian
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
that
in
Italy
my
sympathies
are
not
with
my
own
countrymen
.
*NL*
It
is
the
neglected
Italians
who
attract
me
,
and
whose
lives
I
am
going
*NL*
to
paint
so
far
as
I
can
.
For
I
repeat
and
I
insist
,
and
I
have
always
*NL*
held
most
strongly
,
that
a
tragedy
such
as
yesterday
's
is
not
the
less
*NL*
tragic
because
it
happened
in
humble
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
fitting
silence
when
Miss
Lavish
had
concluded
.
Then
the
*NL*
cousins
wished
success
to
her
labours
,
and
walked
slowly
away
across
the
*NL*
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
my
idea
of
a
really
clever
woman
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
.
``
That
*NL*
last
remark
struck
me
as
so
particularly
true
.
It
should
be
a
most
*NL*
pathetic
novel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
assented
.
At
present
her
great
aim
was
not
to
get
put
into
it
.
Her
*NL*
perceptions
this
morning
were
curiously
keen
,
and
she
believed
that
Miss
*NL*
Lavish
had
her
on
trial
for
an
ingenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
emancipated
,
but
only
in
the
very
best
sense
of
the
word
,
''
*NL*
continued
Miss
Bartlett
slowly
.
``
None
but
the
superficial
would
be
*NL*
shocked
at
her
.
We
had
a
long
talk
yesterday
.
She
believes
in
justice
*NL*
and
truth
and
human
interest
.
She
told
me
also
that
she
has
a
high
*NL*
opinion
of
the
destiny
of
woman
--
Mr.
Eager
!
Why
,
how
nice
!
What
a
*NL*
pleasant
surprise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
not
for
me
,
''
said
the
chaplain
blandly
,
``
for
I
have
been
watching
*NL*
you
and
Miss
Honeychurch
for
quite
a
little
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
chatting
to
Miss
Lavish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
brow
contracted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
saw
.
Were
you
indeed
?
Andate
via
!
sono
occupato
!
''
The
last
remark
*NL*
was
made
to
a
vender
of
panoramic
photographs
who
was
approaching
with
a
*NL*
courteous
smile
.
``
I
am
about
to
venture
a
suggestion
.
Would
you
and
*NL*
Miss
Honeychurch
be
disposed
to
join
me
in
a
drive
some
day
this
week
--
a
*NL*
drive
in
the
hills
?
We
might
go
up
by
Fiesole
and
back
by
Settignano
.
*NL*
There
is
a
point
on
that
road
where
we
could
get
down
and
have
an
*NL*
hour
's
ramble
on
the
hillside
.
The
view
thence
of
Florence
is
most
*NL*
beautiful
--
far
better
than
the
hackneyed
view
of
Fiesole
.
It
is
the
view
*NL*
that
Alessio
Baldovinetti
is
fond
of
introducing
into
his
pictures
.
That
*NL*
man
had
a
decided
feeling
for
landscape
.
Decidedly
.
But
who
looks
at
it
*NL*
to-day
?
Ah
,
the
world
is
too
much
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
had
not
heard
of
Alessio
Baldovinetti
,
but
she
knew
*NL*
that
Mr.
Eager
was
no
commonplace
chaplain
.
He
was
a
member
of
the
*NL*
residential
colony
who
had
made
Florence
their
home
.
He
knew
the
people
*NL*
who
never
walked
about
with
Baedekers
,
who
had
learnt
to
take
a
siesta
*NL*
after
lunch
,
who
took
drives
the
pension
tourists
had
never
heard
of
,
*NL*
and
saw
by
private
influence
galleries
which
were
closed
to
them
.
Living
*NL*
in
delicate
seclusion
,
some
in
furnished
flats
,
others
in
Renaissance
*NL*
villas
on
Fiesole
's
slope
,
they
read
,
wrote
,
studied
,
and
exchanged
*NL*
ideas
,
thus
attaining
to
that
intimate
knowledge
,
or
rather
perception
,
*NL*
of
Florence
which
is
denied
to
all
who
carry
in
their
pockets
the
*NL*
coupons
of
Cook
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
an
invitation
from
the
chaplain
was
something
to
be
proud
of
.
*NL*
Between
the
two
sections
of
his
flock
he
was
often
the
only
link
,
and
it
*NL*
was
his
avowed
custom
to
select
those
of
his
migratory
sheep
who
seemed
*NL*
worthy
,
and
give
them
a
few
hours
in
the
pastures
of
the
permanent
.
Tea
*NL*
at
a
Renaissance
villa
?
Nothing
had
been
said
about
it
yet
.
But
if
it
*NL*
did
come
to
that
--
how
Lucy
would
enjoy
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
ago
and
Lucy
would
have
felt
the
same
.
But
the
joys
of
life
*NL*
were
grouping
themselves
anew
.
A
drive
in
the
hills
with
Mr.
Eager
and
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
--
even
if
culminating
in
a
residential
tea-party
--
was
*NL*
no
longer
the
greatest
of
them
.
She
echoed
the
raptures
of
Charlotte
*NL*
somewhat
faintly
.
Only
when
she
heard
that
Mr.
Beebe
was
also
coming
did
*NL*
her
thanks
become
more
sincere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
shall
be
a
partie
carree
,
''
said
the
chaplain
.
``
In
these
days
of
*NL*
toil
and
tumult
one
has
great
needs
of
the
country
and
its
message
of
*NL*
purity
.
Andate
via
!
andate
presto
,
presto
!
Ah
,
the
town
!
Beautiful
as
it
*NL*
is
,
it
is
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
very
square
--
so
I
am
told
--
witnessed
yesterday
the
most
sordid
of
*NL*
tragedies
.
To
one
who
loves
the
Florence
of
Dante
and
Savonarola
*NL*
there
is
something
portentous
in
such
desecration
--
portentous
and
*NL*
humiliating
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humiliating
indeed
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
.
``
Miss
Honeychurch
happened
to
*NL*
be
passing
through
as
it
happened
.
She
can
hardly
bear
to
speak
of
it
.
''
*NL*
She
glanced
at
Lucy
proudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
came
we
to
have
you
here
?
''
asked
the
chaplain
paternally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
's
recent
liberalism
oozed
away
at
the
question
.
``
Do
*NL*
not
blame
her
,
please
,
Mr.
Eager
.
The
fault
is
mine
:
I
left
her
*NL*
unchaperoned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
were
here
alone
,
Miss
Honeychurch
?
''
His
voice
suggested
*NL*
sympathetic
reproof
but
at
the
same
time
indicated
that
a
few
harrowing
*NL*
details
would
not
be
unacceptable
.
His
dark
,
handsome
face
drooped
*NL*
mournfully
towards
her
to
catch
her
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Practically
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
our
pension
acquaintances
kindly
brought
her
home
,
''
said
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
,
adroitly
concealing
the
sex
of
the
preserver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
her
also
it
must
have
been
a
terrible
experience
.
I
trust
that
*NL*
neither
of
you
was
at
all
--
that
it
was
not
in
your
immediate
proximity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
many
things
Lucy
was
noticing
to-day
,
not
the
least
remarkable
*NL*
was
this
:
the
ghoulish
fashion
in
which
respectable
people
will
nibble
*NL*
after
blood
.
George
Emerson
had
kept
the
subject
strangely
pure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
died
by
the
fountain
,
I
believe
,
''
was
her
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
and
your
friend
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
over
at
the
Loggia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
have
saved
you
much
.
You
have
not
,
of
course
,
seen
the
*NL*
disgraceful
illustrations
which
the
gutter
Press
--
This
man
is
a
public
*NL*
nuisance
;
he
knows
that
I
am
a
resident
perfectly
well
,
and
yet
he
goes
*NL*
on
worrying
me
to
buy
his
vulgar
views
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Surely
the
vendor
of
photographs
was
in
league
with
Lucy
--
in
the
eternal
*NL*
league
of
Italy
with
youth
.
He
had
suddenly
extended
his
book
before
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
and
Mr.
Eager
,
binding
their
hands
together
by
a
long
*NL*
glossy
ribbon
of
churches
,
pictures
,
and
views
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
too
much
!
''
cried
the
chaplain
,
striking
petulantly
at
one
of
*NL*
Fra
Angelico
's
angels
.
She
tore
.
A
shrill
cry
rose
from
the
vendor
.
The
*NL*
book
it
seemed
,
was
more
valuable
than
one
would
have
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Willingly
would
I
purchase
--
''
began
Miss
Bartlett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ignore
him
,
''
said
Mr.
Eager
sharply
,
and
they
all
walked
rapidly
away
*NL*
from
the
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
an
Italian
can
never
be
ignored
,
least
of
all
when
he
has
a
*NL*
grievance
.
His
mysterious
persecution
of
Mr.
Eager
became
relentless
;
*NL*
the
air
rang
with
his
threats
and
lamentations
.
He
appealed
to
Lucy
;
*NL*
would
not
she
intercede
?
He
was
poor
--
he
sheltered
a
family
--
the
tax
on
*NL*
bread
.
He
waited
,
he
gibbered
,
he
was
recompensed
,
he
was
dissatisfied
,
*NL*
he
did
not
leave
them
until
he
had
swept
their
minds
clean
of
all
*NL*
thoughts
whether
pleasant
or
unpleasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shopping
was
the
topic
that
now
ensued
.
Under
the
chaplain
's
guidance
*NL*
they
selected
many
hideous
presents
and
mementoes
--
florid
little
*NL*
picture-frames
that
seemed
fashioned
in
gilded
pastry
;
other
little
*NL*
frames
,
more
severe
,
that
stood
on
little
easels
,
and
were
carven
out
*NL*
of
oak
;
a
blotting
book
of
vellum
;
a
Dante
of
the
same
material
;
cheap
*NL*
mosaic
brooches
,
which
the
maids
,
next
Christmas
,
would
never
tell
from
*NL*
real
;
pins
,
pots
,
heraldic
saucers
,
brown
art-photographs
;
Eros
and
*NL*
Psyche
in
alabaster
;
St.
Peter
to
match
--
all
of
which
would
have
cost
*NL*
less
in
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
successful
morning
left
no
pleasant
impressions
on
Lucy
.
She
had
*NL*
been
a
little
frightened
,
both
by
Miss
Lavish
and
by
Mr.
Eager
,
she
knew
*NL*
not
why
.
And
as
they
frightened
her
,
she
had
,
strangely
enough
,
ceased
*NL*
to
respect
them
.
She
doubted
that
Miss
Lavish
was
a
great
artist
.
She
*NL*
doubted
that
Mr.
Eager
was
as

of
spirituality
and
culture

she
*NL*
had
been
led
to
suppose

They
were
tried
by
some
new
test
,
and
they
were
*NL*
found
wanting

As
for
Charlotte
--
as
for
Charlotte
she
was
exactly
the
*NL*
same
.
It
might
be
possible
to
be
nice
to
her
;
it
was
impossible
to
love
*NL*
her

*NL*
``
The
son
of
a
labourer
;
I
happen
to
know
it
for
a
fact
.
A
mechanic
of
*NL*
some
sort
himself
when
he
was
young
;
then
he
took
to
writing
for
the
*NL*
Socialistic
Press
.
I
came
across
him
at
Brixton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
talking
about
the
Emersons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
wonderfully
people
rise
in
these
days
!
''
sighed
Miss
Bartlett
,
*NL*
fingering
a
model
of
the
leaning
Tower
of
Pisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Generally
,
''
replied
Mr.
Eager
,
``
one
has
only
sympathy
for
their
*NL*
success
.
The
desire
for
education
and
for
social
advance
--
in
these
*NL*
things
there
is
something
not
wholly
vile
.
There
are
some
working
men
*NL*
whom
one
would
be
very
willing
to
see
out
here
in
Florence
--
little
as
*NL*
they
would
make
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
a
journalist
now
?
''
Miss
Bartlett
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
;
he
made
an
advantageous
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
uttered
this
remark
with
a
voice
full
of
meaning
,
and
ended
with
a
*NL*
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
so
he
has
a
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
,
Miss
Bartlett

dead

I
wonder

yes
I
wonder
how
he
has
the
*NL*
effrontery
to
look
me
in
the
face
,
to
dare
to
claim
acquaintance
with
*NL*
me
.
He
was
in
my
London
parish
long
ago
.
The
other
day
in
Santa
Croce
,
*NL*
when
he
was
with
Miss
Honeychurch
,
I
snubbed
him
.
Let
him
beware
that
he
*NL*
does
not
get
more
than
a
snub
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
cried
Lucy
,
flushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exposure
!
''
hissed
Mr.
Eager
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
change
the
subject
;
but
in
scoring
a
dramatic
point
he
had
*NL*
interested
his
audience
more
than
he
had
intended
.
Miss
Bartlett
was
*NL*
full
of
very
natural
curiosity
.
Lucy
,
though
she
wished
never
to
see
the
*NL*
Emersons
again
,
was
not
disposed
to
condemn
them
on
a
single
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
,
''
she
asked
,
``
that
he
is
an
irreligious
man
?
We
know
that
*NL*
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
,
dear
--
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
gently
reproving
her
cousin
's
*NL*
penetration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
astonished
if
you
knew
all
.
The
boy
--
an
innocent
child
at
*NL*
the
time

I
will
exclude
.
God
knows
what
his
education
and
his
inherited
*NL*
qualities
may
have
made
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
``
it
is
something
that
we
had
better
not
*NL*
hear

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
speak
plainly

''
said
Mr.
Eager
,
``
it
is
.
I
will
say
no
more

''
For
the
*NL*
first
time
Lucy
's
rebellious
thoughts
swept
out
in
words
--
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
said
very
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
intention
to
say
very
little
,
''
was
his
frigid
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gazed
indignantly
at
the
girl
,
who
met
him
with
equal
indignation
.
*NL*
She
turned
towards
him
from
the
shop
counter
;
her
breast
heaved
quickly
.
*NL*
He
observed
her
brow
,
and
the
sudden
strength
of
her
lips
.
It
was
*NL*
intolerable
that
she
should
disbelieve
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Murder
,
if
you
want
to
know
,
''
he
cried
angrily
.
``
That
man
murdered
his
*NL*
wife
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
she
retorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
all
intents
and
purposes
he
murdered
her

That
day

Croce

anything

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

Mr.

not
a
single

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
thought
they
had
been
libelling
me
to
you
.
But
I
suppose
it
is
*NL*
only
their
personal
charms
that
makes
you
defend
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
defending
them
,
''
said
Lucy
,
losing
her
courage
,
and
relapsing
*NL*
into
the
old
chaotic
methods
.
``
They
're
nothing
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
you
think
she
was
defending
them
?
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
much
*NL*
discomfited
by
the
unpleasant
scene
.
The
shopman
was
possibly
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
find
it
difficult
.
For
that
man
has
murdered
his
wife
in
the
*NL*
sight
of
God

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
addition
of
God
was
striking
.
But
the
chaplain
was
really
trying
*NL*
to
qualify
a
rash
remark
.
A
silence
followed
which
might
have
been
*NL*
impressive
,
but
was
merely
awkward
.
Then
Miss
Bartlett
hastily
purchased
*NL*
the
Leaning
Tower
,
and
led
the
way
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
be
going
,
''
said
he
,
shutting
his
eyes
and
taking
out
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
,
and
spoke
with
enthusiasm
of
*NL*
the
approaching
drive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drive
?
Oh
,
is
our
drive
to
come
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
recalled
to
her
manners
,
and
after
a
little
exertion
the
*NL*
complacency
of
Mr.
Eager
was
restored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bother
the
drive
!
''
exclaimed
the
girl
,
as
soon
as
he
had
departed
.
``
It
*NL*
is
just
the
drive
we
had
arranged
with
Mr.
Beebe
without
any
fuss
at
*NL*
all
.
Why
should
he
invite
us
in
that
absurd
manner
?
We
might
as
well
*NL*
invite
him
.
We
are
each
paying
for
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
,
who
had
intended
to
lament
over
the
Emersons
,
was
*NL*
launched
by
this
remark
into
unexpected
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
is
so
,
dear
--
if
the
drive
we
and
Mr.
Beebe
are
going
with
Mr.
*NL*
Eager
is
really
the
same
as
the
one
we
are
going
with
Mr.
Beebe
,
then
I
*NL*
foresee
a
sad
kettle
of
fish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
Mr.
Beebe
has
asked
Eleanor
Lavish
to
come
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
mean
another
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Far
worse
.
Mr.
Eager
does
not
like
Eleanor
.
She
knows
it
herself
.
The
*NL*
truth
must
be
told
;
she
is
too
unconventional
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
now
in
the
newspaper-room
at
the
English
bank
.
Lucy
stood
by
*NL*
the
central
table
,
heedless
of
Punch
and
the
Graphic
,
trying
to
answer
,
*NL*
or
at
all
events
to
formulate
the
questions
rioting
in
her
brain
.
The
*NL*
well-known
world
had
broken
up
,
and
there
emerged
Florence
,
a
magic
*NL*
city
where
people
thought
and
did
the
most
extraordinary
things
.
Murder
,
*NL*
accusations
of
murder
,
a
lady
clinging
to
one
man
and
being
rude
to
*NL*
another
--
were
these
the
daily
incidents
of
her
streets
?
Was
there
more
*NL*
in
her
frank
beauty
than
met
the
eye
--
the
power
,
perhaps
,
to
evoke
*NL*
passions
,
good
and
bad
,
and
to
bring
them
speedily
to
a
fulfillment
?
*NL*
*NL*
Happy
Charlotte
,
who
,
though
greatly
troubled
over
things
that
did
not
*NL*
matter
,
seemed
oblivious
to
things
that
did
;
who
could
conjecture
with
*NL*
admirable
delicacy
``
where
things
might
lead
to
,
''
but
apparently
lost
*NL*
sight
of
the
goal
as
she
approached
it
.
Now
she
was
crouching
in
the
*NL*
corner
trying
to
extract
a
circular
note
from
a
kind
of
linen
nose-bag
*NL*
which
hung
in
chaste
concealment
round
her
neck
.
She
had
been
told
that
*NL*
this
was
the
only
safe
way
to
carry
money
in
Italy
;
it
must
only
*NL*
be
broached
within
the
walls
of
the
English
bank
.
As
she
groped
she
*NL*
murmured
:
``
Whether
it
is
Mr.
Beebe
who
forgot
to
tell
Mr.
Eager
,
or
Mr.
*NL*
Eager
who
forgot
when
he
told
us
,
or
whether
they
have
decided
to
leave
*NL*
Eleanor
out
altogether
--
which
they
could
scarcely
do
--
but
in
any
case
*NL*
we
must
be
prepared
.
It
is
you
they
really
want
;
I
am
only
asked
for
*NL*
appearances
.
You
shall
go
with
the
two
gentlemen
,
and
I
and
Eleanor
will
*NL*
follow
behind
.
A
one-horse
carriage
would
do
for
us
.
Yet
how
difficult
*NL*
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
indeed
,
''
replied
the
girl
,
with
a
gravity
that
sounded
*NL*
sympathetic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
about
it
?
''
asked
Miss
Bartlett
,
flushed
from
the
*NL*
struggle
,
and
buttoning
up
her
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
think
,
nor
what
I
want

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
Lucy
!
I
do
hope
Florence
is
n't
boring
you
.
Speak
the
word
,
*NL*
and
,
as
you
know
,
I
would
take
you
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Charlotte
,
''
said
Lucy
,
and
pondered
over
the
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
letters
for
her
at
the
bureau
--
one
from
her
brother
,
full
*NL*
of
athletics
and
biology
;
one
from
her
mother
,
delightful
as
only
her
*NL*
mother
's
letters
could
be
.
She
had
read
in
it
of
the
crocuses
which
had
*NL*
been
bought
for
yellow
and
were
coming
up
puce
,
of
the
new
parlour-maid
,
*NL*
who
had
watered
the
ferns
with
essence
of
lemonade
,
of
the
semi-detached
*NL*
cottages
which
were
ruining
Summer
Street
,
and
breaking
the
heart
of
Sir
*NL*
Harry
Otway
.
She
recalled
the
free
,
pleasant
life
of
her
home
,
where
she
*NL*
was
allowed
to
do
everything
,
and
where
nothing
ever
happened
to
her
.
*NL*
The
road
up
through
the
pine-woods
,
the
clean
drawing-room
,
the
view
*NL*
over
the
Sussex
Weald
--
all
hung
before
her
bright
and
distinct
,
but
*NL*
pathetic
as
the
pictures
in
a
gallery
to
which
,
after
much
experience
,
a
*NL*
traveller
returns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
news
?
''
asked
Miss
Bartlett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Vyse
and
her
son
have
gone
to
Rome
,
''
said
Lucy
,
giving
the
news
*NL*
that
interested
her
least
.
``
Do
you
know
the
Vyses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
that
way
back

We
can
never

too
much

Piazza
*NL*
Signoria

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
nice
people

So
clever

my
idea

really
*NL*
clever

Do

you
long
to
be
in
Rome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
die
for
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Piazza
Signoria
is
too
stony
to
be
brilliant
.
It
has
no
grass
,
*NL*
no
flowers
,
no
frescoes
,
no
glittering
walls
of
marble
or
comforting
*NL*
patches
of
ruddy
brick
.
By
an
odd
chance
--
unless
we
believe
in
a
*NL*
presiding
genius
of
places
--
the
statues
that
relieve
its
severity
*NL*
suggest
,
not
the
innocence
of
childhood
,
nor
the
glorious
bewilderment
*NL*
of
youth
,
but
the
conscious
achievements
of
maturity
.
Perseus
and
*NL*
Judith
,
Hercules
and
Thusnelda
,
they
have
done
or
suffered
something
,
*NL*
and
though
they
are
immortal
,
immortality
has
come
to
them
after
*NL*
experience
,
not
before
.
Here
,
not
only
in
the
solitude
of
Nature
,
might
*NL*
a
hero
meet
a
goddess
,
or
a
heroine
a
god
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charlotte
!
''
cried
the
girl
suddenly
.
``
Here
's
an
idea

What
if
we
popped
*NL*
off
to

to-morrow

straight

hotel

For
I
do
know
what

No

Do

*NL*
Miss

,
with
equal
vivacity

replied
:

*NL*
``
Oh

droll
person

Pray

what
would
become

your
drive
in

hills

*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
together
through
the
gaunt
beauty
of
the
square
,
laughing

over
the
unpractical
suggestion

Chapter
VI
:
The
Reverend
Arthur
Beebe
,
the
Reverend
Cuthbert
Eager
,
*NL*
Mr.
Emerson
,
Mr.
George
Emerson
,
Miss
Eleanor
Lavish
,
Miss
Charlotte
*NL*
Bartlett
,
and
Miss
Lucy
Honeychurch
Drive
Out
in
Carriages
to
See
a
*NL*
View
;
Italians
Drive
Them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Phaethon
who
drove
them
to
Fiesole
that
memorable
day
,
a
youth
*NL*
all
irresponsibility
and
fire
,
recklessly
urging
his
master
's
horses
up
*NL*
the
stony
hill
.
Mr.
Beebe
recognized
him
at
once
.
Neither
the
Ages
of
*NL*
Faith
nor
the
Age
of
Doubt
had
touched
him
;
he
was
Phaethon
in
Tuscany
*NL*
driving
a
cab
.
And
it
was
Persephone
whom
he
asked
leave
to
pick
up
on
*NL*
the
way
,
saying
that
she
was
his
sister
--
Persephone
,
tall
and
slender
*NL*
and
pale
,
returning
with
the
Spring
to
her
mother
's
cottage
,
and
still
*NL*
shading
her
eyes
from
the
unaccustomed
light
.
To
her
Mr.
Eager
objected
,
*NL*
saying
that
here
was
the
thin
edge
of
the
wedge
,
and
one
must
guard
*NL*
against
imposition
.
But
the
ladies
interceded
,
and
when
it
had
been
made
*NL*
clear
that
it
was
a
very
great
favour
,
the
goddess
was
allowed
to
mount
*NL*
beside
the
god
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phaethon
at
once
slipped
the
left
rein
over
her
head
,
thus
enabling
*NL*
himself
to
drive
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
She
did
not
mind
.
*NL*
Mr.
Eager
,
who
sat
with
his
back
to
the
horses
,
saw
nothing
of
the
*NL*
indecorous
proceeding
,
and
continued
his
conversation
with
Lucy
.
The
*NL*
other
two
occupants
of
the
carriage
were
old
Mr.
Emerson
and
Miss
*NL*
Lavish
.
For
a
dreadful
thing
had
happened
:
Mr.
Beebe
,
without
consulting
*NL*
Mr.
Eager
,
had
doubled
the
size
of
the
party
.
And
though
Miss
Bartlett
*NL*
and
Miss
Lavish
had
planned
all
the
morning
how
the
people
were
to
sit
,
*NL*
at
the
critical
moment
when
the
carriages
came
round
they
lost
their
*NL*
heads
,
and
Miss
Lavish
got
in
with
Lucy
,
while
Miss
Bartlett
,
with
*NL*
George
Emerson
and
Mr.
Beebe
,
followed
on
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
hard
on
the
poor
chaplain
to
have
his
partie
carree
thus
*NL*
transformed
.
Tea
at
a
Renaissance
villa
,
if
he
had
ever
meditated
it
,
*NL*
was
now
impossible
.
Lucy
and
Miss
Bartlett
had
a
certain
style
about
*NL*
them
,
and
Mr.
Beebe
,
though
unreliable
,
was
a
man
of
parts
.
But
a
shoddy
*NL*
lady
writer
and
a
journalist
who
had
murdered
his
wife
in
the
sight
of
*NL*
God
--
they
should
enter
no
villa
at
his
introduction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
,
elegantly
dressed
in
white
,
sat
erect
and
nervous
amid
these
*NL*
explosive
ingredients
,
attentive
to
Mr.
Eager
,
repressive
towards
Miss
*NL*
Lavish
,
watchful
of
old
Mr.
Emerson
,
hitherto
fortunately
asleep
,
thanks
*NL*
to
a
heavy
lunch
and
the
drowsy
atmosphere
of
Spring
.
She
looked
on
the
*NL*
expedition
as
the
work
of
Fate
.
But
for
it
she
would
have
avoided
George
*NL*
Emerson
successfully
.
In
an
open
manner
he
had
shown
that
he
wished
to
*NL*
continue
their
intimacy
.
She
had
refused
,
not
because
she
disliked
him
,
*NL*
but
because
she
did
not
know
what
had
happened
,
and
suspected
that
he
*NL*
did
know
.
And
this
frightened
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
real
event
--
whatever
it
was
--
had
taken
place
,
not
in
the
Loggia
,
*NL*
but
by
the
river
.
To
behave
wildly
at
the
sight
of
death
is
pardonable
.
*NL*
But
to
discuss
it
afterwards
,
to
pass
from
discussion
into
silence
,
*NL*
and
through
silence
into
sympathy
,
that
is
an
error
,
not
of
a
startled
*NL*
emotion
,
but
of
the
whole
fabric
.
There
was
really
something
blameworthy
*NL*
-LRB-
she
thought
-RRB-
in
their
joint
contemplation
of
the
shadowy
stream
,
in
the
*NL*
common
impulse
which
had
turned
them
to
the
house
without
the
passing
of
*NL*
a
look
or
word
.
This
sense
of
wickedness
had
been
slight
at
first
.
She
*NL*
had
nearly
joined
the
party
to
the
Torre
del
Gallo
.
But
each
time
that
*NL*
she
avoided
George
it
became
more
imperative
that
she
should
avoid
*NL*
him
again
.
And
now
celestial
irony
,
working
through
her
cousin
and
two
*NL*
clergymen
,
did
not
suffer
her
to
leave
Florence
till
she
had
made
this
*NL*
expedition
with
him
through
the
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Mr.
Eager
held
her
in
civil
converse
;
their
little
tiff
was
*NL*
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
Miss
Honeychurch
,
you
are
travelling
?
As
a
student
of
art
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
,
no
--
oh
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
as
a
student
of
human
nature
,
''
interposed
Miss
Lavish
,
``
like
*NL*
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
.
I
am
here
as
a
tourist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
,
''
said
Mr.
Eager
.
``
Are
you
indeed
?
If
you
will
not
think
me
*NL*
rude
,
we
residents
sometimes
pity
you
poor
tourists
not
a
little
--
handed
*NL*
about
like
a
parcel
of
goods
from
Venice
to
Florence
,
from
Florence
to
*NL*
Rome
,
living
herded
together
in
pensions
or
hotels
,
quite
unconscious
*NL*
of
anything
that
is
outside
Baedeker
,
their
one
anxiety
to
get
`
done
'
*NL*
or
`
through
'
and
go
on
somewhere
else
.
The
result
is
,
they
mix
up
towns
,
*NL*
rivers
,
palaces
in
one
inextricable
whirl
.
You
know
the
American
girl
*NL*
in
Punch
who
says
:
`
Say
,
poppa
,
what
did
we
see
at
Rome
?
'
And
the
father
*NL*
replies
:
`
Why
,
guess
Rome
was
the
place
where
we
saw
the
yaller
dog
.
'
*NL*
There
's
travelling
for
you
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
agree
,
''
said
Miss
Lavish
,
who
had
several
times
tried
to
*NL*
interrupt
his
mordant
wit
.
``
The
narrowness
and
superficiality
of
the
*NL*
Anglo-Saxon
tourist
is
nothing
less
than
a
menace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
.
Now
,
the
English
colony
at
Florence
,
Miss
Honeychurch
--
and
it
*NL*
is
of
considerable
size
,
though
,
of
course
,
not
all
equally
--
a
few
are
*NL*
here
for
trade
,
for
example
.
But
the
greater
part
are
students
.
Lady
*NL*
Helen
Laverstock
is
at
present
busy
over
Fra
Angelico
.
I
mention
her
*NL*
name
because
we
are
passing
her
villa
on
the
left
.
No
,
you
can
only
see
*NL*
it
if
you
stand
--
no
,
do
not
stand
;
you
will
fall
.
She
is
very
proud
of
*NL*
that
thick
hedge
.
Inside
,
perfect
seclusion
.
One
might
have
gone
back
*NL*
six
hundred
years
.
Some
critics
believe
that
her
garden
was
the
scene
of
*NL*
The
Decameron
,
which
lends
it
an
additional
interest
,
does
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
indeed
!
''
cried
Miss
Lavish
.
``
Tell
me
,
where
do
they
place
the
*NL*
scene
of
that
wonderful
seventh
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Eager
proceeded
to
tell
Miss
Honeychurch
that
on
the
right
lived
*NL*
Mr.
Someone
Something
,
an
American
of
the
best
type
--
so
rare
!
--
and
that
*NL*
the
Somebody
Elses
were
farther
down
the
hill
.
``
Doubtless
you
know
*NL*
her
monographs
in
the
series
of
`
Mediaeval
Byways
'
?
He
is
working
at
*NL*
Gemistus
Pletho
.
Sometimes
as
I
take
tea
in
their
beautiful
grounds
I
*NL*
hear
,
over
the
wall
,
the
electric
tram
squealing
up
the
new
road
with
*NL*
its
loads
of
hot
,
dusty
,
unintelligent
tourists
who
are
going
to
`
do
'
*NL*
Fiesole
in
an
hour
in
order
that
they
may
say
they
have
been
there
,
and
*NL*
I
think
--
think
--
I
think
how
little
they
think
what
lies
so
near
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
speech
the
two
figures
on
the
box
were
sporting
with
each
*NL*
other
disgracefully
.
Lucy
had
a
spasm
of
envy
.
Granted
that
they
wished
*NL*
to
misbehave
,
it
was
pleasant
for
them
to
be
able
to
do
so
.
They
were
*NL*
probably
the
only
people
enjoying
the
expedition
.
The
carriage
swept
*NL*
with
agonizing
jolts
up
through
the
Piazza
of
Fiesole
and
into
the
*NL*
Settignano
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Piano
!
piano
!
''
said
Mr.
Eager
,
elegantly
waving
his
hand
over
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Va
bene
,
signore
,
va
bene
,
va
bene
,
''
crooned
the
driver
,
and
whipped
*NL*
his
horses
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Mr.
Eager
and
Miss
Lavish
began
to
talk
against
each
other
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
Alessio
Baldovinetti
.
Was
he
a
cause
of
the
Renaissance
,
or
*NL*
was
he
one
of
its
manifestations
?
The
other
carriage
was
left
behind
.
As
*NL*
the
pace
increased
to
a
gallop
the
large
,
slumbering
form
of
Mr.
Emerson
*NL*
was
thrown
against
the
chaplain
with
the
regularity
of
a
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Piano
!
piano
!
''
said
he
,
with
a
martyred
look
at
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
extra
lurch
made
him
turn
angrily
in
his
seat
.
Phaethon
,
who
for
some
*NL*
time
had
been
endeavouring
to
kiss
Persephone
,
had
just
succeeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
scene
ensued
,
which
,
as
Miss
Bartlett
said
afterwards
,
was
*NL*
most
unpleasant
.
The
horses
were
stopped
,
the
lovers
were
ordered
to
*NL*
disentangle
themselves
,
the
boy
was
to
lose
his
pourboire
,
the
girl
was
*NL*
immediately
to
get
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
my
sister
,
''
said
he
,
turning
round
on
them
with
piteous
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Eager
took
the
trouble
to
tell
him
that
he
was
a
liar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phaethon
hung
down
his
head
,
not
at
the
matter
of
the
accusation
,
but
*NL*
at
its
manner
.
At
this
point
Mr.
Emerson
,
whom
the
shock
of
stopping
*NL*
had
awoke
,
declared
that
the
lovers
must
on
no
account
be
separated
,
and
*NL*
patted
them
on
the
back
to
signify
his
approval
.
And
Miss
Lavish
,
though
*NL*
unwilling
to
ally
him
,
felt
bound
to
support
the
cause
of
Bohemianism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
certainly
I
would
let
them
be
,
''
she
cried
.
``
But
I
dare
say
I
*NL*
shall
receive
scant
support
.
I
have
always
flown
in
the
face
of
the
*NL*
conventions
all
my
life
.
This
is
what
I
call
an
adventure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
not
submit
,
''
said
Mr.
Eager
.
``
I
knew
he
was
trying
it
on
.
He
is
*NL*
treating
us
as
if
we
were
a
party
of
Cook
's
tourists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
no
!
''
said
Miss
Lavish
,
her
ardour
visibly
decreasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
carriage
had
drawn
up
behind
,
and
sensible
Mr.
Beebe
*NL*
called
out
that
after
this
warning
the
couple
would
be
sure
to
behave
*NL*
themselves
properly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
them
alone
,
''
Mr.
Emerson
begged
the
chaplain
,
of
whom
he
stood
*NL*
in
no
awe
.
``
Do
we
find
happiness
so
often
that
we
should
turn
it
off
the
*NL*
box
when
it
happens
to
sit
there
?
To
be
driven
by
lovers
--
A
king
might
*NL*
envy
us
,
and
if
we
part
them
it
's
more
like
sacrilege
than
anything
I
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
voice
of
Miss
Bartlett
was
heard
saying
that
a
crowd
had
begun
*NL*
to
collect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Eager
,
who
suffered
from
an
over-fluent
tongue
rather
than
a
*NL*
resolute
will
,
was
determined
to
make
himself
heard
.
He
addressed
the
*NL*
driver
again
.
Italian
in
the
mouth
of
Italians
is
a
deep-voiced
stream
,
*NL*
with
unexpected
cataracts
and
boulders
to
preserve
it
from
monotony
.
*NL*
In
Mr.
Eager
's
mouth
it
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
an
acid
whistling
*NL*
fountain
which
played
ever
higher
and
higher
,
and
quicker
and
quicker
,
*NL*
and
more
and
more
shrilly
,
till
abruptly
it
was
turned
off
with
a
click
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Signorina
!
''
said
the
man
to
Lucy
,
when
the
display
had
ceased
.
Why
*NL*
should
he
appeal
to
Lucy
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Signorina
!
''
echoed
Persephone
in
her
glorious
contralto
.
She
pointed
at
*NL*
the
other
carriage
.
Why
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
the
two
girls
looked
at
each
other
.
Then
Persephone
got
*NL*
down
from
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Victory
at
last
!
''
said
Mr.
Eager
,
smiting
his
hands
together
as
the
*NL*
carriages
started
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
victory
,
''
said
Mr.
Emerson
.
``
It
is
defeat
.
You
have
parted
*NL*
two
people
who
were
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Eager
shut
his
eyes
.
He
was
obliged
to
sit
next
to
Mr.
Emerson
,
but
*NL*
he
would
not
speak
to
him
.
The
old
man
was
refreshed
by
sleep
,
and
took
*NL*
up
the
matter
warmly
.
He
commanded
Lucy
to
agree
with
him
;
he
shouted
*NL*
for
support
to
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
tried
to
buy
what
can
not
be
bought
with
money
.
He
has
bargained
*NL*
to
drive
us
,
and
he
is
doing
it
.
We
have
no
rights
over
his
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
frowned
.
It
is
hard
when
a
person
you
have
classed
as
*NL*
typically
British
speaks
out
of
his
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
not
driving
us
well
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
jolted
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
deny
.
It
was
as
restful
as
sleeping
.
Aha
!
he
is
jolting
us
now
.
*NL*
Can
you
wonder
?
He
would
like
to
throw
us
out
,
and
most
certainly
he
is
*NL*
justified
.
And
if
I
were
superstitious
I
'd
be
frightened
of
the
girl
,
*NL*
too
.
It
does
n't
do
to
injure
young
people
.
Have
you
ever
heard
of
*NL*
Lorenzo
de
Medici
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
bristled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
certainly
I
have
.
Do
you
refer
to
Lorenzo
il
Magnifico
,
or
to
*NL*
Lorenzo
,
Duke
of
Urbino
,
or
to
Lorenzo
surnamed
Lorenzino
on
account
of
*NL*
his
diminutive
stature
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lord
knows
.
Possibly
he
does
know
,
for
I
refer
to
Lorenzo
the
poet
.
*NL*
He
wrote
a
line
--
so
I
heard
yesterday
--
which
runs
like
this
:
`
Do
n't
go
*NL*
fighting
against
the
Spring
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Eager
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
for
erudition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Non
fate
guerra
al
Maggio
,
''
he
murmured
.
''
`
War
not
with
the
May
'
would
*NL*
render
a
correct
meaning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
point
is
,
we
have
warred
with
it
.
Look
.
''
He
pointed
to
the
Val
*NL*
d'Arno
,
which
was
visible
far
below
them
,
through
the
budding
trees
.
*NL*
``
Fifty
miles
of
Spring
,
and
we
've
come
up
to
admire
them
.
Do
you
suppose
*NL*
there
's
any
difference
between
Spring
in
nature
and
Spring
in
man
?
But
*NL*
there
we
go
,
praising
the
one
and
condemning
the
other
as
improper
,
*NL*
ashamed
that
the
same
laws
work
eternally
through
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
encouraged
him
to
talk
.
Presently
Mr.
Eager
gave
a
signal
for
the
*NL*
carriages
to
stop
and
marshalled
the
party
for
their
ramble
on
the
hill
.
*NL*
A
hollow
like
a
great
amphitheatre
,
full
of
terraced
steps
and
misty
*NL*
olives
,
now
lay
between
them
and
the
heights
of
Fiesole
,
and
the
road
,
*NL*
still
following
its
curve
,
was
about
to
sweep
on
to
a
promontory
which
*NL*
stood
out
in
the
plain
.
It
was
this
promontory
,
uncultivated
,
wet
,
*NL*
covered
with
bushes
and
occasional
trees
,
which
had
caught
the
fancy
of
*NL*
Alessio
Baldovinetti
nearly
five
hundred
years
before
.
He
had
ascended
*NL*
it
,
that
diligent
and
rather
obscure
master
,
possibly
with
an
eye
to
*NL*
business
,
possibly
for
the
joy
of
ascending
.
Standing
there
,
he
had
seen
*NL*
that
view
of
the
Val
d'Arno
and
distant
Florence
,
which
he
afterwards
*NL*
had
introduced
not
very
effectively
into
his
work
.
But
where
exactly
had
*NL*
he
stood
?
That
was
the
question
which
Mr.
Eager
hoped
to
solve
now
.
And
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
,
whose
nature
was
attracted
by
anything
problematical
,
had
*NL*
become
equally
enthusiastic
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
not
easy
to
carry
the
pictures
of
Alessio
Baldovinetti
in
your
*NL*
head
,
even
if
you
have
remembered
to
look
at
them
before
starting
.
And
*NL*
the
haze
in
the
valley
increased
the
difficulty
of
the
quest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
sprang
about
from
tuft
to
tuft
of
grass
,
their
anxiety
to
keep
*NL*
together
being
only
equalled
by
their
desire
to
go
different
directions
.
*NL*
Finally
they
split
into
groups
.
Lucy
clung
to
Miss
Bartlett
and
Miss
*NL*
Lavish
;
the
Emersons
returned
to
hold
laborious
converse
with
the
*NL*
drivers
;
while
the
two
clergymen
,
who
were
expected
to
have
topics
in
*NL*
common
,
were
left
to
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
elder
ladies
soon
threw
off
the
mask
.
In
the
audible
whisper
*NL*
that
was
now
so
familiar
to
Lucy
they
began
to
discuss
,
not
Alessio
*NL*
Baldovinetti
,
but
the
drive
.
Miss
Bartlett
had
asked
Mr.
George
Emerson
*NL*
what
his
profession
was
,
and
he
had
answered
``
the
railway
.
''
She
was
very
*NL*
sorry
that
she
had
asked
him
.
She
had
no
idea
that
it
would
be
such
a
*NL*
dreadful
answer
,
or
she
would
not
have
asked
him
.
Mr.
Beebe
had
turned
*NL*
the
conversation
so
cleverly
,
and
she
hoped
that
the
young
man
was
not
*NL*
very
much
hurt
at
her
asking
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
railway
!
''
gasped
Miss
Lavish
.
``
Oh
,
but
I
shall
die
!
Of
course
it
*NL*
was
the
railway
!
''
She
could
not
control
her
mirth
.
``
He
is
the
image
of
a
*NL*
porter
--
on
,
on
the
South-Eastern
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eleanor
,
be
quiet
,
''
plucking
at
her
vivacious
companion
.
``
Hush
!
They
'll
*NL*
hear
--
the
Emersons
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stop
.
Let
me
go
my
wicked
way
.
A
porter
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eleanor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
it
's
all
right
,
''
put
in
Lucy
.
``
The
Emersons
wo
n't
hear
,
and
*NL*
they
would
n't
mind
if
they
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
did
not
seem
pleased
at
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Honeychurch
listening
!
''
she
said
rather
crossly
.
``
Pouf
!
Wouf
!
You
*NL*
naughty
girl
!
Go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lucy
,
you
ought
to
be
with
Mr.
Eager
,
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
find
them
now
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Eager
will
be
offended
.
It
is
your
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
I
'd
rather
stop
here
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
agree
,
''
said
Miss
Lavish
.
``
It
's
like
a
school
feast
;
the
boys
*NL*
have
got
separated
from
the
girls
.
Miss
Lucy
,
you
are
to
go
.
We
wish
to
*NL*
converse
on
high
topics
unsuited
for
your
ear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
was
stubborn
.
As
her
time
at
Florence
drew
to
its
close
she
was
*NL*
only
at
ease
amongst
those
to
whom
she
felt
indifferent
.
Such
a
one
was
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
,
and
such
for
the
moment
was
Charlotte
.
She
wished
she
had
*NL*
not
called
attention
to
herself
;
they
were
both
annoyed
at
her
remark
*NL*
and
seemed
determined
to
get
rid
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
tired
one
gets
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
.
``
Oh
,
I
do
wish
Freddy
and
your
*NL*
mother
could
be
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Unselfishness
with
Miss
Bartlett
had
entirely
usurped
the
functions
of
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
Lucy
did
not
look
at
the
view
either
.
She
would
not
enjoy
*NL*
anything
till
she
was
safe
at
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
sit
you
down
,
''
said
Miss
Lavish
.
``
Observe
my
foresight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
many
a
smile
she
produced
two
of
those
mackintosh
squares
that
*NL*
protect
the
frame
of
the
tourist
from
damp
grass
or
cold
marble
steps
.
*NL*
She
sat
on
one
;
who
was
to
sit
on
the
other
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
;
without
a
moment
's
doubt
,
Lucy
.
The
ground
will
do
for
me
.
Really
*NL*
I
have
not
had
rheumatism
for
years
.
If
I
do
feel
it
coming
on
I
shall
*NL*
stand
.
Imagine
your
mother
's
feelings
if
I
let
you
sit
in
the
wet
*NL*
in
your
white
linen
.
''
She
sat
down
heavily
where
the
ground
looked
*NL*
particularly
moist
.
``
Here
we
are
,
all
settled
delightfully
.
Even
if
my
*NL*
dress
is
thinner
it
will
not
show
so
much
,
being
brown
.
Sit
down
,
dear
;
*NL*
you
are
too
unselfish
;
you
do
n't
assert
yourself
enough
.
''
She
cleared
*NL*
her
throat
.
``
Now
do
n't
be
alarmed
;
this
is
n't
a
cold
.
It
's
the
tiniest
*NL*
cough
,
and
I
have
had
it
three
days
.
It
's
nothing
to
do
with
sitting
*NL*
here
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
only
one
way
of
treating
the
situation
.
At
the
end
of
five
*NL*
minutes
Lucy
departed
in
search
of
Mr.
Beebe
and
Mr.
Eager
,
vanquished
*NL*
by
the
mackintosh
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
addressed
herself
to
the
drivers
,
who
were
sprawling
in
the
*NL*
carriages
,
perfuming
the
cushions
with
cigars
.
The
miscreant
,
a
bony
*NL*
young
man
scorched
black
by
the
sun
,
rose
to
greet
her
with
the
courtesy
*NL*
of
a
host
and
the
assurance
of
a
relative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dove
?
''
said
Lucy
,
after
much
anxious
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
lit
up
.
Of
course
he
knew
where
.
Not
so
far
either
.
His
arm
*NL*
swept
three-fourths
of
the
horizon
.
He
should
just
think
he
did
know
*NL*
where
.
He
pressed
his
finger-tips
to
his
forehead
and
then
pushed
them
*NL*
towards
her
,
as
if
oozing
with
visible
extract
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
seemed
necessary
.
What
was
the
Italian
for
``
clergyman
''
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dove
buoni
uomini
?
''
said
she
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Good
?
Scarcely
the
adjective
for
those
noble
beings
!
He
showed
her
his
*NL*
cigar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uno
--
piu
--
piccolo
,
''
was
her
next
remark
,
implying
``
Has
the
cigar
been
*NL*
given
to
you
by
Mr.
Beebe
,
the
smaller
of
the
two
good
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
correct
as
usual
.
He
tied
the
horse
to
a
tree
,
kicked
it
to
make
*NL*
it
stay
quiet
,
dusted
the
carriage
,
arranged
his
hair
,
remoulded
his
*NL*
hat
,
encouraged
his
moustache
,
and
in
rather
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
minute
was
ready
to
conduct
her
.
Italians
are
born
knowing
the
way
.
It
*NL*
would
seem
that
the
whole
earth
lay
before
them
,
not
as
a
map
,
but
as
a
*NL*
chess-board
,
whereon
they
continually
behold
the
changing
pieces
as
well
*NL*
as
the
squares
.
Any
one
can
find
places
,
but
the
finding
of
people
is
a
*NL*
gift
from
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
stopped
once
,
to
pick
her
some
great
blue
violets
.
She
thanked
*NL*
him
with
real
pleasure
.
In
the
company
of
this
common
man
the
world
*NL*
was
beautiful
and
direct
.
For
the
first
time
she
felt
the
influence
*NL*
of
Spring
.
His
arm
swept
the
horizon
gracefully
;
violets
,
like
other
*NL*
things
,
existed
in
great
profusion
there
;
``
would
she
like
to
see
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
buoni
uomini
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
.
Certainly
.
Good
men
first
,
violets
afterwards
.
They
proceeded
*NL*
briskly
through
the
undergrowth
,
which
became
thicker
and
thicker
.
They
*NL*
were
nearing
the
edge
of
the
promontory
,
and
the
view
was
stealing
round
*NL*
them
,
but
the
brown
network
of
the
bushes
shattered
it
into
countless
*NL*
pieces
.
He
was
occupied
in
his
cigar
,
and
in
holding
back
the
pliant
*NL*
boughs
.
She
was
rejoicing
in
her
escape
from
dullness
.
Not
a
step
,
not
a
*NL*
twig
,
was
unimportant
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
voice
in
the
wood
,
in
the
distance
behind
them
.
The
voice
*NL*
of
Mr.
Eager
?
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
An
Italian
's
ignorance
is
*NL*
sometimes
more
remarkable
than
his
knowledge
.
She
could
not
make
him
*NL*
understand
that
perhaps
they
had
missed
the
clergymen
.
The
view
was
*NL*
forming
at
last
;
she
could
discern
the
river
,
the
golden
plain
,
other
*NL*
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eccolo
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
the
ground
gave
way
,
and
with
a
cry
she
fell
out
of
*NL*
the
wood
.
Light
and
beauty
enveloped
her
.
She
had
fallen
on
to
a
little
*NL*
open
terrace
,
which
was
covered
with
violets
from
end
to
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Courage
!
''
cried
her
companion
,
now
standing
some
six
feet
above
.
*NL*
``
Courage
and
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
From
her
feet
the
ground
sloped
sharply
into
view
,
*NL*
and
violets
ran
down
in
rivulets
and
streams
and
cataracts
,
irrigating
*NL*
the
hillside
with
blue
,
eddying
round
the
tree
stems
collecting
into
*NL*
pools
in
the
hollows
,
covering
the
grass
with
spots
of
azure
foam
.
But
*NL*
never
again
were
they
in
such
profusion
;
this
terrace
was
the
well-head
,
*NL*
the
primal
source
whence
beauty
gushed
out
to
water
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Standing
at
its
brink
,
like
a
swimmer
who
prepares
,
was
the
good
man
.
*NL*
But
he
was
not
the
good
man
that
she
had
expected
,
and
he
was
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
had
turned
at
the
sound
of
her
arrival
.
For
a
moment
he
*NL*
contemplated
her
,
as
one
who
had
fallen
out
of
heaven
.
He
saw
radiant
*NL*
joy
in
her
face
,
he
saw
the
flowers
beat
against
her
dress
in
blue
*NL*
waves
.
The
bushes
above
them
closed
.
He
stepped
quickly
forward
and
*NL*
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
she
could
speak
,
almost
before
she
could
feel
,
a
voice
called
,
*NL*
``
Lucy
!
Lucy
!
Lucy
!
''
The
silence
of
life
had
been
broken
by
Miss
Bartlett
*NL*
who
stood
brown
against
the
view
.

Chapter
VII
:
They
Return
*NL*
*NL*
Some
complicated
game
had
been
playing
up
and
down
the
hillside
all
the
*NL*
afternoon
.
What
it
was
and
exactly
how
the
players
had
sided
,
Lucy
*NL*
was
slow
to
discover
.
Mr.
Eager
had
met
them
with
a
questioning
eye
.
*NL*
Charlotte
had
repulsed
him
with
much
small
talk
.
Mr.
Emerson
,
seeking
*NL*
his
son
,
was
told
whereabouts
to
find
him
.
Mr.
Beebe
,
who
wore
the
*NL*
heated
aspect
of
a
neutral
,
was
bidden
to
collect
the
factions
for
the
*NL*
return
home
.
There
was
a
general
sense
of
groping
and
bewilderment
.
Pan
*NL*
had
been
amongst
them
--
not
the
great
god
Pan
,
who
has
been
buried
these
*NL*
two
thousand
years
,
but
the
little
god
Pan
,
who
presides
over
social
*NL*
contretemps
and
unsuccessful
picnics
.
Mr.
Beebe
had
lost
everyone
,
and
*NL*
had
consumed
in
solitude
the
tea-basket
which
he
had
brought
up
as
a
*NL*
pleasant
surprise
.
Miss
Lavish
had
lost
Miss
Bartlett
.
Lucy
had
lost
Mr.
*NL*
Eager
.
Mr.
Emerson
had
lost
George
.
Miss
Bartlett
had
lost
a
mackintosh
*NL*
square
.
Phaethon
had
lost
the
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
last
fact
was
undeniable
.
He
climbed
on
to
the
box
shivering
,
with
*NL*
his
collar
up
,
prophesying
the
swift
approach
of
bad
weather
.
``
Let
us
go
*NL*
immediately
,
''
he
told
them
.
``
The
signorino
will
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
way
?
He
will
be
hours
,
''
said
Mr.
Beebe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apparently
.
I
told
him
it
was
unwise
.
''
He
would
look
no
one
in
the
*NL*
face
;
perhaps
defeat
was
particularly
mortifying
for
him
.
He
alone
had
*NL*
played
skilfully
,
using
the
whole
of
his
instinct
,
while
the
others
*NL*
had
used
scraps
of
their
intelligence
.
He
alone
had
divined
what
things
*NL*
were
,
and
what
he
wished
them
to
be
.
He
alone
had
interpreted
the
*NL*
message
that
Lucy
had
received
five
days
before
from
the
lips
of
a
*NL*
dying
man
.
Persephone
,
who
spends
half
her
life
in
the
grave
--
she
could
*NL*
interpret
it
also
.
Not
so
these
English
.
They
gain
knowledge
slowly
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thoughts
of
a
cab-driver
,
however
just
,
seldom
affect
the
lives
of
*NL*
his
employers
.
He
was
the
most
competent
of
Miss
Bartlett
's
opponents
,
*NL*
but
infinitely
the
least
dangerous
.
Once
back
in
the
town
,
he
and
his
*NL*
insight
and
his
knowledge
would
trouble
English
ladies
no
more
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
it
was
most
unpleasant
;
she
had
seen
his
black
head
in
the
*NL*
bushes
;
he
might
make
a
tavern
story
out
of
it
.
But
after
all
,
what
have
*NL*
we
to
do
with
taverns
?
Real
menace
belongs
to
the
drawing-room
.
It
*NL*
was
of
drawing-room
people
that
Miss
Bartlett
thought
as
she
journeyed
*NL*
downwards
towards
the
fading
sun
.
Lucy
sat
beside
her
;
Mr.
Eager
sat
*NL*
opposite
,
trying
to
catch
her
eye
;
he
was
vaguely
suspicious
.
They
spoke
*NL*
of
Alessio
Baldovinetti
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rain
and
darkness
came
on
together
.
The
two
ladies
huddled
together
*NL*
under
an
inadequate
parasol
.
There
was
a
lightning
flash
,
and
Miss
*NL*
Lavish
who
was
nervous
,
screamed
from
the
carriage
in
front
.
At
the
next
*NL*
flash
,
Lucy
screamed
also
.
Mr.
Eager
addressed
her
professionally
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Courage
,
Miss
Honeychurch
,
courage
and
faith
.
If
I
might
say
so
,
there
*NL*
is
something
almost
blasphemous
in
this
horror
of
the
elements
.
Are
we
*NL*
seriously
to
suppose
that
all
these
clouds
,
all
this
immense
electrical
*NL*
display
,
is
simply
called
into
existence
to
extinguish
you
or
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
of
course
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
from
the
scientific
standpoint
the
chances
against
our
being
*NL*
struck
are
enormous
.
The
steel
knives
,
the
only
articles
which
might
*NL*
attract
the
current
,
are
in
the
other
carriage
.
And
,
in
any
case
,
we
are
*NL*
infinitely
safer
than
if
we
were
walking
.
Courage
--
courage
and
faith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
rug
,
Lucy
felt
the
kindly
pressure
of
her
cousin
's
hand
.
At
*NL*
times
our
need
for
a
sympathetic
gesture
is
so
great
that
we
care
*NL*
not
what
exactly
it
signifies
or
how
much
we
may
have
to
pay
for
it
*NL*
afterwards
.
Miss
Bartlett
,
by
this
timely
exercise
of
her
muscles
,
*NL*
gained
more
than
she
would
have
got
in
hours
of
preaching
or
cross
*NL*
examination
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
renewed
it
when
the
two
carriages
stopped
,
half
into
Florence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Eager
!
''
called
Mr.
Beebe
.
``
We
want
your
assistance
.
Will
you
*NL*
interpret
for
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
!
''
cried
Mr.
Emerson
.
``
Ask
your
driver
which
way
George
went
.
The
*NL*
boy
may
lose
his
way
.
He
may
be
killed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
Mr.
Eager
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
``
do
n't
ask
our
driver
;
our
driver
is
*NL*
no
help
.
Go
and
support
poor
Mr.
Beebe
--
,
he
is
nearly
demented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
may
be
killed
!
''
cried
the
old
man
.
``
He
may
be
killed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Typical
behaviour
,
''
said
the
chaplain
,
as
he
quitted
the
carriage
.
``
In
*NL*
the
presence
of
reality
that
kind
of
person
invariably
breaks
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
he
know
?
''
whispered
Lucy
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
.
*NL*
``
Charlotte
,
how
much
does
Mr.
Eager
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
dearest
;
he
knows
nothing
.
But
--
''
she
pointed
at
the
*NL*
driver
-
``
HE
knows
everything
.
Dearest
,
had
we
better
?
Shall
I
?
''
She
took
*NL*
out
her
purse
.
``
It
is
dreadful
to
be
entangled
with
low-class
people
.
*NL*
He
saw
it
all
.
''
Tapping
Phaethon
's
back
with
her
guide-book
,
she
said
,
*NL*
``
Silenzio
!
''
and
offered
him
a
franc
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Va
bene
,
''
he
replied
,
and
accepted
it
.
As
well
this
ending
to
his
day
*NL*
as
any
.
But
Lucy
,
a
mortal
maid
,
was
disappointed
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
explosion
up
the
road
.
The
storm
had
struck
the
overhead
*NL*
wire
of
the
tramline
,
and
one
of
the
great
supports
had
fallen
.
If
they
*NL*
had
not
stopped
perhaps
they
might
have
been
hurt
.
They
chose
to
regard
*NL*
it
as
a
miraculous
preservation
,
and
the
floods
of
love
and
sincerity
,
*NL*
which
fructify
every
hour
of
life
,
burst
forth
in
tumult
.
They
descended
*NL*
from
the
carriages
;
they
embraced
each
other
.
It
was
as
joyful
to
be
*NL*
forgiven
past
unworthinesses
as
to
forgive
them
.
For
a
moment
they
*NL*
realized
vast
possibilities
of
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
older
people
recovered
quickly
.
In
the
very
height
of
their
emotion
*NL*
they
knew
it
to
be
unmanly
or
unladylike
.
Miss
Lavish
calculated
that
,
*NL*
even
if
they
had
continued
,
they
would
not
have
been
caught
in
the
*NL*
accident
.
Mr.
Eager
mumbled
a
temperate
prayer
.
But
the
drivers
,
through
*NL*
miles
of
dark
squalid
road
,
poured
out
their
souls
to
the
dryads
and
the
*NL*
saints
,
and
Lucy
poured
out
hers
to
her
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charlotte
,
dear
Charlotte
,
kiss
me
.
Kiss
me
again
.
Only
you
can
*NL*
understand
me
.
You
warned
me
to
be
careful
.
And
I
--
I
thought
I
was
*NL*
developing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
cry
,
dearest
.
Take
your
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
obstinate
and
silly
--
worse
than
you
know
,
far
worse
.
Once
*NL*
by
the
river
--
Oh
,
but
he
is
n't
killed
--
he
would
n't
be
killed
,
would
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
disturbed
her
repentance
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
the
storm
was
*NL*
worst
along
the
road
;
but
she
had
been
near
danger
,
and
so
she
thought
*NL*
it
must
be
near
to
everyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
not
.
One
would
always
pray
against
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
really
--
I
think
he
was
taken
by
surprise
,
just
as
I
was
before
.
*NL*
But
this
time
I
'm
not
to
blame
;
I
want
you
to
believe
that
.
I
simply
*NL*
slipped
into
those
violets
.
No
,
I
want
to
be
really
truthful
.
I
am
a
*NL*
little
to
blame
.
I
had
silly
thoughts
.
The
sky
,
you
know
,
was
gold
,
*NL*
and
the
ground
all
blue
,
and
for
a
moment
he
looked
like
someone
in
a
*NL*
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
book
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heroes
--
gods
--
the
nonsense
of
schoolgirls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Charlotte
,
you
know
what
happened
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
was
silent
.
Indeed
,
she
had
little
more
to
learn
.
With
a
*NL*
certain
amount
of
insight
she
drew
her
young
cousin
affectionately
*NL*
to
her
.
All
the
way
back
Lucy
's
body
was
shaken
by
deep
sighs
,
which
*NL*
nothing
could
repress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
be
truthful
,
''
she
whispered
.
``
It
is
so
hard
to
be
absolutely
*NL*
truthful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
troubled
,
dearest
.
Wait
till
you
are
calmer
.
We
will
talk
it
*NL*
over
before
bed-time
in
my
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
re-entered
the
city
with
hands
clasped
.
It
was
a
shock
to
the
*NL*
girl
to
find
how
far
emotion
had
ebbed
in
others
.
The
storm
had
ceased
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
Emerson
was
easier
about
his
son
.
Mr.
Beebe
had
regained
good
*NL*
humour
,
and
Mr.
Eager
was
already
snubbing
Miss
Lavish
.
Charlotte
alone
*NL*
she
was
sure
of
--
Charlotte
,
whose
exterior
concealed
so
much
insight
and
*NL*
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
luxury
of
self-exposure
kept
her
almost
happy
through
the
long
*NL*
evening
.
She
thought
not
so
much
of
what
had
happened
as
of
how
she
*NL*
should
describe
it
.
All
her
sensations
,
her
spasms
of
courage
,
her
*NL*
moments
of
unreasonable
joy
,
her
mysterious
discontent
,
should
be
*NL*
carefully
laid
before
her
cousin
.
And
together
in
divine
confidence
they
*NL*
would
disentangle
and
interpret
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
,
''
thought
she
,
``
I
shall
understand
myself
.
I
sha
n't
again
*NL*
be
troubled
by
things
that
come
out
of
nothing
,
and
mean
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Alan
asked
her
to
play
.
She
refused
vehemently
.
Music
seemed
to
*NL*
her
the
employment
of
a
child
.
She
sat
close
to
her
cousin
,
who
,
with
*NL*
commendable
patience
,
was
listening
to
a
long
story
about
lost
luggage
.
*NL*
When
it
was
over
she
capped
it
by
a
story
of
her
own
.
Lucy
became
rather
*NL*
hysterical
with
the
delay
.
In
vain
she
tried
to
check
,
or
at
all
events
*NL*
to
accelerate
,
the
tale
.
It
was
not
till
a
late
hour
that
Miss
Bartlett
*NL*
had
recovered
her
luggage
and
could
say
in
her
usual
tone
of
gentle
*NL*
reproach
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
dear
,
I
at
all
events
am
ready
for
Bedfordshire
.
Come
into
my
*NL*
room
,
and
I
will
give
a
good
brush
to
your
hair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
some
solemnity
the
door
was
shut
,
and
a
cane
chair
placed
for
the
*NL*
girl
.
Then
Miss
Bartlett
said
``
So
what
is
to
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
unprepared
for
the
question
.
It
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
she
*NL*
would
have
to
do
anything
.
A
detailed
exhibition
of
her
emotions
was
all
*NL*
that
she
had
counted
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
be
done
?
A
point
,
dearest
,
which
you
alone
can
settle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
was
streaming
down
the
black
windows
,
and
the
great
room
felt
*NL*
damp
and
chilly
,
One
candle
burnt
trembling
on
the
chest
of
drawers
*NL*
close
to
Miss
Bartlett
's
toque
,
which
cast
monstrous
and
fantastic
*NL*
shadows
on
the
bolted
door
.
A
tram
roared
by
in
the
dark
,
and
Lucy
felt
*NL*
unaccountably
sad
,
though
she
had
long
since
dried
her
eyes
.
She
lifted
*NL*
them
to
the
ceiling
,
where
the
griffins
and
bassoons
were
colourless
and
*NL*
vague
,
the
very
ghosts
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
raining
for
nearly
four
hours
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
ignored
the
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
propose
to
silence
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
driver
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
girl
,
no

Mr.
George
Emerson

*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
understood
very
well
,
but
she
no
longer
wished
to
be
absolutely
*NL*
truthful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
going
to
stop
him
talking
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
feeling
that
talk
is
a
thing
he
will
never
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
too
,
intend
to
judge
him
charitably
.
But
unfortunately
I
have
met
*NL*
the
type
before
.
They
seldom
keep
their
exploits
to
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exploits
?
''
cried
Lucy
,
wincing
under
the
horrible
plural
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
dear
,
did
you
suppose
that
this
was
his
first
?
Come
here
*NL*
and
listen
to
me
.
I
am
only
gathering
it
from
his
own
remarks
.
Do
you
*NL*
remember
that
day
at
lunch
when
he
argued
with
Miss
Alan
that
liking
one
*NL*
person
is
an
extra
reason
for
liking
another
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lucy
,
whom
at
the
time
the
argument
had
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
no
prude
.
There
is
no
need
to
call
him
a
wicked
young
man
,
*NL*
but
obviously
he
is
thoroughly
unrefined
.
Let
us
put
it
down
to
his
*NL*
deplorable
antecedents
and
education
,
if
you
wish
.
But
we
are
no
farther
*NL*
on
with
our
question
.
What
do
you
propose
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
idea
rushed
across
Lucy
's
brain
,
which
,
had
she
thought
of
it
sooner
*NL*
and
made
it
part
of
her
,
might
have
proved
victorious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
propose
to
speak
to
him

said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
uttered
a
cry
of
genuine
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see

your
kindness

I
shall
never

it

it
is
my
affair

Mine

*NL*
``
And
you
are
going

to
BEG
him
to
keep
silence

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not

There
would
be
no
difficulty

Whatever
you
ask
him

*NL*
answers

yes

then
it
is
over

I
have
been
frightened

now
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

take
a
brutal
pleasure

not

rally
round

This
afternoon
,
for
example

not
arrived

what
would
have
happened

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca

said
Lucy
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
her
voice
made
Miss
Bartlett
repeat
her
question
,
intoning
*NL*
it
more
vigorously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

She
checked
herself
,
and
broke
the
sentence
off
.
She
*NL*
went
up
to
the
dripping
window
and
strained
her
eyes
into
the
darkness
.
*NL*
She
could
not
think
what
she
would
have
done

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
said
Miss
Bartlett
.
``
You
will
be
seen
*NL*
from
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
obeyed
.
She
was
in
her
cousin
's
power
.
She
could
not
modulate
out
*NL*
the
key
of
self-abasement
in
which
she
had
started
.
Neither
of
them
*NL*
referred
again
to
her
suggestion
that
she
should
speak
to
George
and
*NL*
settle
the
matter
,
whatever
it
was
,
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
became
plaintive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
for
a
real
man
!
We
are
only
two
women
,
you
and
I
.
Mr.
Beebe
is
*NL*
hopeless
.
There
is
Mr.
Eager
,
but
you
do
not
trust
him
.
Oh
,
for
your
*NL*
brother
!
He
is
young
,
but
I
know
that
his
sister
's
insult
would
rouse
*NL*
in
him
a
very
lion
.
Thank
God
,
chivalry
is
not
yet
dead
.
There
are
still
*NL*
left
some
men
who
can
reverence
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
,
she
pulled
off
her
rings
,
of
which
she
wore
several
,
and
*NL*
ranged
them
upon
the
pin
cushion
.
Then
she
blew
into
her
gloves
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
a
push
to
catch
the
morning
train
,
but
we
must
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
train
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
train
to
Rome
.
''
She
looked
at
her
gloves
critically
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
received
the
announcement
as
easily
as
it
had
been
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
does
the
train
to
Rome
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
eight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Signora
Bertolini
would
be
upset
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
face
that
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
not
liking
to
say
that
she
had
*NL*
given
notice
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
make
us
pay
for
a
whole
week
's
pension
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
she
will
.
However
,
we
shall
be
much
more
comfortable
at
the
*NL*
Vyses
'
hotel
.
Is
n't
afternoon
tea
given
there
for
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
they
pay
extra
for
wine
.
''
After
this
remark
she
remained
*NL*
motionless
and
silent
.
To
her
tired
eyes
Charlotte
throbbed
and
swelled
*NL*
like
a
ghostly
figure
in
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
to
sort
their
clothes
for
packing
,
for
there
was
no
time
to
*NL*
lose
,
if
they
were
to
catch
the
train
to
Rome
.
Lucy
,
when
admonished
,
*NL*
began
to
move
to
and
fro
between
the
rooms
,
more
conscious
of
the
*NL*
discomforts
of
packing
by
candlelight
than
of
a
subtler
ill
.
Charlotte
,
*NL*
who
was
practical
without
ability
,
knelt
by
the
side
of
an
empty
trunk
,
*NL*
vainly
endeavouring
to
pave
it
with
books
of
varying
thickness
and
size
.
*NL*
She
gave
two
or
three
sighs
,
for
the
stooping
posture
hurt
her
back
,
*NL*
and
,
for
all
her
diplomacy
,
she
felt
that
she
was
growing
old
.
The
girl
*NL*
heard
her
as
she
entered
the
room
,
and
was
seized
with
one
of
those
*NL*
emotional
impulses
to
which
she
could
never
attribute
a
cause
.
She
only
*NL*
felt
that
the
candle
would
burn
better
,
the
packing
go
easier
,
the
world
*NL*
be
happier
,
if
she
could
give
and
receive
some
human
love
.
The
impulse
*NL*
had
come
before
to-day
,
but
never
so
strongly
.
She
knelt
down
by
her
*NL*
cousin
's
side
and
took
her
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
returned
the
embrace
with
tenderness
and
warmth
.
But
she
*NL*
was
not
a
stupid
woman
,
and
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
Lucy
did
not
*NL*
love
her
,
but
needed
her
to
love
.
For
it
was
in
ominous
tones
that
she
*NL*
said
,
after
a
long
pause
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
Lucy
,
how
will
you
ever
forgive
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
on
her
guard
at
once
,
knowing
by
bitter
experience
what
*NL*
forgiving
Miss
Bartlett
meant
.
Her
emotion
relaxed
,
she
modified
her
*NL*
embrace
a
little
,
and
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charlotte
dear
,
what
do
you
mean
?
As
if
I
have
anything
to
forgive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
great
deal
,
and
I
have
a
very
great
deal
to
forgive
myself
,
*NL*
too
.
I
know
well
how
much
I
vex
you
at
every
turn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
assumed
her
favourite
role
,
that
of
the
prematurely
aged
*NL*
martyr
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
yes
!
I
feel
that
our
tour
together
is
hardly
the
success
I
had
*NL*
hoped
.
I
might
have
known
it
would
not
do
.
You
want
someone
younger
*NL*
and
stronger
and
more
in
sympathy
with
you
.
I
am
too
uninteresting
and
*NL*
old-fashioned
--
only
fit
to
pack
and
unpack
your
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
only
consolation
was
that
you
found
people
more
to
your
taste
,
and
*NL*
were
often
able
to
leave
me
at
home
.
I
had
my
own
poor
ideas
of
what
a
*NL*
lady
ought
to
do
,
but
I
hope
I
did
not
inflict
them
on
you
more
than
was
*NL*
necessary
.
You
had
your
own
way
about
these
rooms
,
at
all
events
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
say
these
things
,
''
said
Lucy
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
still
clung
to
the
hope
that
she
and
Charlotte
loved
each
other
,
*NL*
heart
and
soul
.
They
continued
to
pack
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
a
failure
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
as
she
struggled
with
the
*NL*
straps
of
Lucy
's
trunk
instead
of
strapping
her
own
.
``
Failed
to
make
you
*NL*
happy
;
failed
in
my
duty
to
your
mother
.
She
has
been
so
generous
to
me
;
*NL*
I
shall
never
face
her
again
after
this
disaster
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
mother
will
understand
.
It
is
not
your
fault
,
this
trouble
,
and
it
*NL*
is
n't
a
disaster
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
fault
,
it
is
a
disaster
.
She
will
never
forgive
me
,
and
*NL*
rightly
.
For
instance
,
what
right
had
I
to
make
friends
with
Miss
*NL*
Lavish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
was
here
for
your
sake
?
If
I
have
vexed
you
it
is
equally
true
*NL*
that
I
have
neglected
you
.
Your
mother
will
see
this
as
clearly
as
I
do
,
*NL*
when
you
tell
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
,
from
a
cowardly
wish
to
improve
the
situation
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
need
mother
hear
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
tell
her
everything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
do
generally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
not
break
your
confidence
.
There
is
something
sacred
in
it
.
*NL*
Unless
you
feel
that
it
is
a
thing
you
could
not
tell
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
would
not
be
degraded
to
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally
I
should
have
told
her
.
But
in
case
she
should
blame
you
in
*NL*
any
way
,
I
promise
I
will
not
,
I
am
very
willing
not
to
.
I
will
never
*NL*
speak
of
it
either
to
her
or
to
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
promise
brought
the
long-drawn
interview
to
a
sudden
close
.
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
pecked
her
smartly
on
both
cheeks
,
wished
her
good-night
,
and
*NL*
sent
her
to
her
own
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
the
original
trouble
was
in
the
background
.
George
would
*NL*
seem
to
have
behaved
like
a
cad
throughout
;
perhaps
that
was
the
view
*NL*
which
one
would
take
eventually
.
At
present
she
neither
acquitted
nor
*NL*
condemned
him
;
she
did
not
pass
judgement
.
At
the
moment
when
she
was
*NL*
about
to
judge
him
her
cousin
's
voice
had
intervened
,
and
,
ever
since
,
*NL*
it
was
Miss
Bartlett
who
had
dominated
;
Miss
Bartlett
who
,
even
*NL*
now
,
could
be
heard
sighing
into
a
crack
in
the
partition
wall
;
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
,
who
had
really
been
neither
pliable
nor
humble
nor
*NL*
inconsistent
.
She
had
worked
like
a
great
artist
;
for
a
time
--
indeed
,
*NL*
for
years
--
she
had
been
meaningless
,
but
at
the
end
there
was
presented
*NL*
to
the
girl
the
complete
picture
of
a
cheerless
,
loveless
world
in
which
*NL*
the
young
rush
to
destruction
until
they
learn
better
--
a
shamefaced
*NL*
world
of
precautions
and
barriers
which
may
avert
evil
,
but
which
do
not
*NL*
seem
to
bring
good
,
if
we
may
judge
from
those
who
have
used
them
most
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
suffering
from
the
most
grievous
wrong
which
this
world
has
yet
*NL*
discovered
:
diplomatic
advantage
had
been
taken
of
her
sincerity
,
of
*NL*
her
craving
for
sympathy
and
love
.
Such
a
wrong
is
not
easily
forgotten
.
*NL*
Never
again
did
she
expose
herself
without
due
consideration
and
*NL*
precaution
against
rebuff
.
And
such
a
wrong
may
react
disastrously
upon
*NL*
the
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door-bell
rang
,
and
she
started
to
the
shutters
.
Before
she
reached
*NL*
them
she
hesitated
,
turned
,
and
blew
out
the
candle
.
Thus
it
was
that
,
*NL*
though
she
saw
someone
standing
in
the
wet
below
,
he
,
though
he
looked
*NL*
up
,
did
not
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
reach
his
room
he
had
to
go
by
hers
.
She
was
still
dressed
.
It
struck
*NL*
her
that
she
might
slip
into
the
passage
and
just
say
that
she
would
*NL*
be
gone
before
he
was
up
,
and
that
their
extraordinary
intercourse
was
*NL*
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
she
would
have
dared
to
do
this
was
never
proved
.
At
the
*NL*
critical
moment
Miss
Bartlett
opened
her
own
door
,
and
her
voice
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
one
word
with
you
in
the
drawing-room
,
Mr.
Emerson
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
their
footsteps
returned
,
and
Miss
Bartlett
said
:
``
Good-night
,
Mr.
*NL*
Emerson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
heavy
,
tired
breathing
was
the
only
reply
;
the
chaperon
had
done
her
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
cried
aloud
:
``
It
is
n't
true
.
It
ca
n't
all
be
true
.
I
want
not
to
be
*NL*
muddled
.
I
want
to
grow
older
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
tapped
on
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
bed
at
once
,
dear
.
You
need
all
the
rest
you
can
get
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
they
left
for
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Part
Two
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
VIII
:
Medieval
*NL*
*NL*
The
drawing-room
curtains
at
Windy
Corner
had
been
pulled
to
meet
,
for
*NL*
the
carpet
was
new
and
deserved
protection
from
the
August
sun
.
They
*NL*
were
heavy
curtains
,
reaching
almost
to
the
ground
,
and
the
light
*NL*
that
filtered
through
them
was
subdued
and
varied
.
A
poet
--
none
was
*NL*
present
--
might
have
quoted
,
``
Life
like
a
dome
of
many
coloured
glass
,
''
*NL*
or
might
have
compared
the
curtains
to
sluice-gates
,
lowered
against
*NL*
the
intolerable
tides
of
heaven
.
Without
was
poured
a
sea
of
radiance
;
*NL*
within
,
the
glory
,
though
visible
,
was
tempered
to
the
capacities
of
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
pleasant
people
sat
in
the
room
.
One
--
a
boy
of
nineteen
--
was
*NL*
studying
a
small
manual
of
anatomy
,
and
peering
occasionally
at
a
bone
*NL*
which
lay
upon
the
piano
.
From
time
to
time
he
bounced
in
his
chair
and
*NL*
puffed
and
groaned
,
for
the
day
was
hot
and
the
print
small
,
and
the
*NL*
human
frame
fearfully
made
;
and
his
mother
,
who
was
writing
a
letter
,
*NL*
did
continually
read
out
to
him
what
she
had
written
.
And
continually
*NL*
did
she
rise
from
her
seat
and
part
the
curtains
so
that
a
rivulet
of
*NL*
light
fell
across
the
carpet
,
and
make
the
remark
that
they
were
still
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
n't
they
?
''
said
the
boy
,
who
was
Freddy
,
Lucy
's
brother
.
``
I
*NL*
tell
you
I
'm
getting
fairly
sick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
goodness
'
sake
go
out
of
my
drawing-room
,
then
?
''
cried
Mrs.
*NL*
Honeychurch
,
who
hoped
to
cure
her
children
of
slang
by
taking
it
*NL*
literally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Freddy
did
not
move
or
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
things
are
coming
to
a
head
,
''
she
observed
,
rather
wanting
*NL*
her
son
's
opinion
on
the
situation
if
she
could
obtain
it
without
undue
*NL*
supplication
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Time
they
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
that
Cecil
is
asking
her
this
once
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
his
third
go
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Freddy
I
do
call
the
way
you
talk
unkind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mean
to
be
unkind
.
''
Then
he
added
:
``
But
I
do
think
Lucy
might
*NL*
have
got
this
off
her
chest
in
Italy
.
I
do
n't
know
how
girls
manage
*NL*
things
,
but
she
ca
n't
have
said
`
No
'
properly
before
,
or
she
would
n't
*NL*
have
to
say
it
again
now
.
Over
the
whole
thing
--
I
ca
n't
explain
--
I
do
*NL*
feel
so
uncomfortable

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
indeed
,
dear
?
How
interesting
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel

never

*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
listen
to
what
I
have
written
to
Mrs.
Vyse

:

*NL*
*NL*
``

told

I
said

,
and
I
should
be
delighted
,
if
Lucy
wishes
it
.
But
--
'
''
She
stopped
*NL*
reading
,
``
I
was
rather
amused
at
Cecil
asking
my
permission
at
all
.
He
*NL*
has
always
gone
in
for
unconventionality
,
and
parents
nowhere
,
and
so
*NL*
forth
.
When
it
comes
to
the
point
,
he
ca
n't
get
on
without
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Freddy
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
asked
me
for
my
permission
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
exclaimed
:
``
How
very
odd
of
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
asked
the
son
and
heir
.
``
Why
should
n't
my
permission
be
*NL*
asked
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
know
about
Lucy
or
girls
or
anything
?
What
ever
did
you
*NL*
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
to
Cecil
,
`
Take
her
or
leave
her
;
it
's
no
business
of
mine
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
helpful
answer
!
''
But
her
own
answer
,
though
more
normal
in
its
*NL*
wording
,
had
been
to
the
same
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bother
is
this
,
''
began
Freddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
took
up
his
work
again
,
too
shy
to
say
what
the
bother
was
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Honeychurch
went
back
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Freddy
,
you
must
come
.
There
they
still
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
you
ought
to
go
peeping
like
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peeping
like
that
!
Ca
n't
I
look
out
of
my
own
window
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
returned
to
the
writing-table
,
observing
,
as
she
passed
her
*NL*
son
,
``
Still
page
322
?
''
Freddy
snorted
,
and
turned
over
two
leaves
.
For
a
*NL*
brief
space
they
were
silent
.
Close
by
,
beyond
the
curtains
,
the
gentle
*NL*
murmur
of
a
long
conversation
had
never
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bother
is
this
:
I
have
put
my
foot
in
it
with
Cecil
most
awfully
.
''
*NL*
He
gave
a
nervous
gulp
.
``
Not
content
with
`
permission
'
,
which
I
did
*NL*
give
--
that
is
to
say
,
I
said
,
'
I
do
n't
mind

--
well
,
not
content
with
*NL*
that
,
he
wanted
to
know
whether
I
was
n't
off
my
head
with
joy
.
He
*NL*
practically
put
it
like
this
:
Was
n't
it
a
splendid
thing
for
Lucy
and
*NL*
for
Windy
Corner
generally
if
he
married
her
?
And
he
would
have
an
*NL*
answer
--
he
said
it
would
strengthen
his
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
gave
a
careful
answer
,
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
answered
`
No

''
said
the
boy
,
grinding
his
teeth
.
``
There
!
Fly
into
a
*NL*
stew
!
I
ca
n't
help
it

had
to

it

I
had
to

no

He
ought
never
to
*NL*
have
asked
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ridiculous
child

cried
his
mother
.
``
You
think
you
're
so
holy
and
*NL*
truthful

really
it
's
only
abominable
conceit

Do

suppose
that
*NL*
a
man
like
Cecil
would
take
the
slightest
notice
of
anything
you
say

I
*NL*
hope
he
boxed
your

How
dare
you

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
had

no

I
*NL*
tried
to
laugh
as

I
did

mean
what
I
said
,
and
,
as
Cecil
laughed
*NL*
too
,
and
went
away

it
may
be
all
right

But
I
feel
my
foot
's
in
it
.
Oh

*NL*
do
keep
quiet

though
,
and
let
a
man
do
some
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
considered
the
*NL*
subject
,
``
I
shall
not
keep
quiet

You
know
all
that
has
passed
between
*NL*
them
in
Rome

he
is
down
here

yet
you
deliberately
*NL*
insult
him
,
and
try
to
turn
him
out
of
my
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
!
''
he
pleaded
.
``
I
only
let
out
I
did
n't
like
him

I
do
n't
hate
*NL*
him

I
do
n't
like
him
.
What
I
mind
is
that
he
'll
tell
Lucy

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
the
curtains
dismally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
like
him
,
''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
.
``
I
know
his

Oh
,
you

kick

the

well
connected

I
'll
say
it
again

you
like

She
paused
,
as
if
rehearsing
her
eulogy
,
but
her
face
*NL*
remained
dissatisfied
.
She
added
:
``
And
he
has
beautiful
manners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
liked
him
till
just
now
.
I
suppose
it
's
having
him
spoiling
Lucy
's
*NL*
first
week
at
home
;
and
it
's
also
something
that
Mr.
Beebe
said
,
not
*NL*
knowing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Beebe
?
''
said
his
mother
,
trying
to
conceal
her
interest
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
see
how
Mr.

comes
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
Mr.
Beebe
's
funny
way
,
when
you
never
quite
know
what
he
*NL*
means

He
said
:
`
Mr.
Vyse
is
an
ideal
bachelor
.
'
I
was
very
cute
,
I
*NL*
asked
him
what
he
meant
.
He
said
`
Oh
,
he
's
like
me
--
better
detached
.
'
I
*NL*
could
n't
make
him
say
any
more
,
but
it
set
me
thinking
.
Since
Cecil
has
*NL*
come
after
Lucy
he
has
n't
been
so
pleasant
,
at
least
--
I
ca
n't
explain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
can
,
dear
.
But
I
can
.
You
are
jealous
of
Cecil
because
he
may
*NL*
stop
Lucy
knitting
you
silk
ties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
explanation
seemed
plausible
,
and
Freddy
tried
to
accept
it
.
But
at
*NL*
the
back
of
his
brain
there
lurked
a
dim
mistrust
.
Cecil
praised
one
too
*NL*
much
for
being
athletic
.
Was
that
it
?
Cecil
made
one
talk
in
one
's
own
*NL*
way
.
This
tired
one
.
Was
that
it
?
And
Cecil
was
the
kind
of
fellow
who
*NL*
would
never
wear
another
fellow
's
cap
.
Unaware
of
his
own
profundity
,
*NL*
Freddy
checked
himself
.
He
must
be
jealous
,
or
he
would
not
dislike
a
*NL*
man
for
such
foolish
reasons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
this
do
?
''
called
his
mother
.
''
`
Dear
Mrs.
Vyse
,
--
Cecil
has
just
*NL*
asked
my
permission
about
it
,
and
I
should
be
delighted

Then
I
put
in
at
the
top
,
`

I
have
told
Lucy
so
.
'
I
must
write
*NL*
the
letter
out
again

I
have
told
Lucy
so

But
Lucy
seems
very
*NL*
uncertain
,
and
in
these
days
young
people
must
decide
for
themselves
.
'
I
*NL*
said
that
because
I
did
n't
want
Mrs.
Vyse
to
think
us
old-fashioned
.
She
*NL*
goes
in
for
lectures
and
improving
her
mind
,
and
all
the
time
a
thick
*NL*
layer
of
flue
under
the
beds
,
and
the
maid
's
dirty
thumb-marks
where
you
*NL*
turn
on
the
electric
light
.
She
keeps
that
flat
abominably
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
Lucy
marries
Cecil
,
would
she
live
in
a
flat

in
the
*NL*
country

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
interrupt
so
foolishly

Where

I

Oh
yes
--

Young
people

I
know
that

likes

because
she

and
she
wrote
to

from
Rome
when

asked
her
*NL*
first
.
'
No
,
I
'll
cross
that
last
bit
out
--
it
looks
patronizing
.
I
'll
*NL*
stop
at
`
because
she
tells
me
everything

'
Or
shall
I
cross
that
out
,
*NL*
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cross
it
out
,
too
,
''
said
Freddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Honeychurch
left
it
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
whole
thing
runs
:
`
Dear
Mrs.
Vyse

--
Cecil
has
just
asked
my

permission
about
it

I
should

But
Lucy
seems
very
uncertain
,
and
in

people
must
decide
for

I
know
that

likes
your
*NL*

tells
me
everything

But
I
do
not
know
--
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out
!
''
cried
Freddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curtains
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
's
first
movement
was
one
of
irritation
.
He
could
n't
bear
the
*NL*
Honeychurch
habit
of
sitting
in
the
dark
to
save
the
furniture
.
*NL*
Instinctively
he
give
the
curtains
a
twitch
,
and
sent
them
swinging
down
*NL*
their
poles
.
Light
entered
.
There
was
revealed
a
terrace
,
such
as
is
*NL*
owned
by
many
villas
with
trees
each
side
of
it
,
and
on
it
a
little
*NL*
rustic
seat
,
and
two
flower-beds
.
But
it
was
transfigured
by
the
view
*NL*
beyond
,
for
Windy
Corner
was
built
on
the
range
that
overlooks
the
*NL*
Sussex
Weald
.
Lucy
,
who
was
in
the
little
seat
,
seemed
on
the
edge
of
a
*NL*
green
magic
carpet
which
hovered
in
the
air
above
the
tremulous
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Appearing
thus
late
in
the
story
,
Cecil
must
be
at
once
described
.
He
*NL*
was
medieval
.
Like
a
Gothic
statue
.
Tall
and
refined
,
with
shoulders
*NL*
that
seemed
braced
square
by
an
effort
of
the
will
,
and
a
head
that
*NL*
was
tilted
a
little
higher
than
the
usual
level
of
vision
,
he
resembled
*NL*
those
fastidious
saints
who
guard
the
portals
of
a
French
cathedral
.
*NL*
Well
educated
,
well
endowed
,
and
not
deficient
physically
,
he
*NL*
remained
in
the
grip
of
a
certain
devil
whom
the
modern
world
knows
*NL*
as
self-consciousness
,
and
whom
the
medieval
,
with
dimmer
vision
,
*NL*
worshipped
as
asceticism
.
A
Gothic
statue
implies
celibacy
,
just
as
*NL*
a
Greek
statue
implies
fruition
,
and
perhaps
this
was
what
Mr.
Beebe
*NL*
meant
.
And
Freddy
,
who
ignored
history
and
art
,
perhaps
meant
the
same
*NL*
when
he
failed
to
imagine
Cecil
wearing
another
fellow
's
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Honeychurch
left
her
letter
on
the
writing
table
and
moved
towards
*NL*
her
young
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Cecil
!
''
she
exclaimed
--
``
oh
,
Cecil
,
do
tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promessi
sposi
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stared
at
him
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
accepted
me
,
''
he
said
,
and
the
sound
of
the
thing
in
English
*NL*
made
him
flush
and
smile
with
pleasure
,
and
look
more
human
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
,
''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
while
Freddy
proffered
a
hand
*NL*
that
was
yellow
with
chemicals
.
They
wished
that
they
also
knew
Italian
,
*NL*
for
our
phrases
of
approval
and
of
amazement
are
so
connected
with
*NL*
little
occasions
that
we
fear
to
use
them
on
great
ones
.
We
are
obliged
*NL*
to
become
vaguely
poetic
,
or
to
take
refuge
in
Scriptural
reminiscences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Welcome
as
one
of
the
family
!
''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
waving
her
hand
*NL*
at
the
furniture
.
``
This
is
indeed
a
joyous
day
!
I
feel
sure
that
you
*NL*
will
make
our
dear
Lucy
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
shifting
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
mothers
--
''
simpered
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
and
then
realized
that
she
*NL*
was
affected
,
sentimental
,
bombastic
--
all
the
things
she
hated
most
.
*NL*
Why
could
she
not
be
Freddy
,
who
stood
stiff
in
the
middle
of
the
room
;
*NL*
looking
very
cross
and
almost
handsome
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Lucy
!
''
called
Cecil
,
for
conversation
seemed
to
flag
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
rose
from
the
seat
.
She
moved
across
the
lawn
and
smiled
in
at
*NL*
them
,
just
as
if
she
was
going
to
ask
them
to
play
tennis
.
Then
she
saw
*NL*
her
brother
's
face
.
Her
lips
parted
,
and
she
took
him
in
her
arms
.
He
*NL*
said
,
``
Steady
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
kiss
for
me
?
''
asked
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
kissed
her
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
take
them
into
the
garden
and
tell
Mrs.
Honeychurch
all
about
*NL*
it
?
''
Cecil
suggested
.
``
And
I
'd
stop
here
and
tell
my
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
go
with
Lucy
?
''
said
Freddy
,
as
if
taking
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
go
with
Lucy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
into
the
sunlight
.
Cecil
watched
them
cross
the
terrace
,
*NL*
and
descend
out
of
sight
by
the
steps
.
They
would
descend
--
he
knew
their
*NL*
ways
--
past
the
shrubbery
,
and
past
the
tennis-lawn
and
the
dahlia-bed
,
*NL*
until
they
reached
the
kitchen
garden
,
and
there
,
in
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
potatoes
and
the
peas
,
the
great
event
would
be
discussed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smiling
indulgently
,
he
lit
a
cigarette
,
and
rehearsed
the
events
that
*NL*
had
led
to
such
a
happy
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
known
Lucy
for
several
years
,
but
only
as
a
commonplace
girl
*NL*
who
happened
to
be
musical
.
He
could
still
remember
his
depression
that
*NL*
afternoon
at
Rome
,
when
she
and
her
terrible
cousin
fell
on
him
out
*NL*
of
the
blue
,
and
demanded
to
be
taken
to
St.
Peter
's
.
That
day
she
had
*NL*
seemed
a
typical
tourist
--
shrill
,
crude
,
and
gaunt
with
travel
.
But
*NL*
Italy
worked
some
marvel
in
her
.
It
gave
her
light
,
and
--
which
he
held
*NL*
more
precious
--
it
gave
her
shadow
.
Soon
he
detected
in
her
a
wonderful
*NL*
reticence
.
She
was
like
a
woman
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci
's
,
whom
we
love
*NL*
not
so
much
for
herself
as
for
the
things
that
she
will
not
tell
us
.
The
*NL*
things
are
assuredly
not
of
this
life
;
no
woman
of
Leonardo
's
could
have
*NL*
anything
so
vulgar
as
a
``
story
.
''
She
did
develop
most
wonderfully
day
by
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
happened
that
from
patronizing
civility
he
had
slowly
passed
if
*NL*
not
to
passion
,
at
least
to
a
profound
uneasiness
.
Already
at
Rome
he
*NL*
had
hinted
to
her
that
they
might
be
suitable
for
each
other
.
It
had
*NL*
touched
him
greatly
that
she
had
not
broken
away
at
the
suggestion
.
*NL*
Her
refusal
had
been
clear
and
gentle
;
after
it
--
as
the
horrid
phrase
*NL*
went
--
she
had
been
exactly
the
same
to
him
as
before
.
Three
months
*NL*
later
,
on
the
margin
of
Italy
,
among
the
flower-clad
Alps
,
he
had
asked
*NL*
her
again
in
bald
,
traditional
language
.
She
reminded
him
of
a
Leonardo
*NL*
more
than
ever
;
her
sunburnt
features
were
shadowed
by
fantastic
rock
;
*NL*
at
his
words
she
had
turned
and
stood
between
him
and
the
light
with
*NL*
immeasurable
plains
behind
her
.
He
walked
home
with
her
unashamed
,
*NL*
feeling
not
at
all
like
a
rejected
suitor
.
The
things
that
really
*NL*
mattered
were
unshaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
now
he
had
asked
her
once
more
,
and
,
clear
and
gentle
as
ever
,
she
*NL*
had
accepted
him
,
giving
no
coy
reasons
for
her
delay
,
but
simply
saying
*NL*
that
she
loved
him
and
would
do
her
best
to
make
him
happy
.
His
mother
,
*NL*
too
,
would
be
pleased
;
she
had
counselled
the
step
;
he
must
write
her
a
*NL*
long
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
Glancing
at
his
hand
,
in
case
any
of
Freddy
's
chemicals
had
come
off
*NL*
on
it
,
he
moved
to
the
writing
table
.
There
he
saw
``
Dear
Mrs.
Vyse
,
''
*NL*
followed
by
many
erasures
.
He
recoiled
without
reading
any
more
,
and
*NL*
after
a
little
hesitation
sat
down
elsewhere
,
and
pencilled
a
note
on
*NL*
his
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
lit
another
cigarette
,
which
did
not
seem
quite
as
divine
as
*NL*
the
first
,
and
considered
what
might
be
done
to
make
Windy
Corner
*NL*
drawing-room
more
distinctive
.
With
that
outlook
it
should
have
been
a
*NL*
successful
room
,
but
the
trail
of
Tottenham
Court
Road
was
upon
it
;
he
*NL*
could
almost
visualize
the
motor-vans
of
Messrs.
Shoolbred
and
Messrs.
*NL*
Maple
arriving
at
the
door
and
depositing
this
chair
,
those
varnished
*NL*
book-cases
,
that
writing-table
.
The
table
recalled
Mrs.
Honeychurch
's
*NL*
letter
.
He
did
not
want
to
read
that
letter
--
his
temptations
never
lay
*NL*
in
that
direction
;
but
he
worried
about
it
none
the
less
.
It
was
his
*NL*
own
fault
that
she
was
discussing
him
with
his
mother
;
he
had
wanted
her
*NL*
support
in
his
third
attempt
to
win
Lucy
;
he
wanted
to
feel
that
others
,
*NL*
no
matter
who
they
were
,
agreed
with
him
,
and
so
he
had
asked
their
*NL*
permission
.
Mrs.
Honeychurch
had
been
civil
,
but
obtuse
in
essentials
,
*NL*
while
as
for
Freddy
--
``
He
is
only
a
boy
,
''
he
reflected
.
``
I
represent
all
*NL*
that
he
despises
.
Why
should
he
want
me
for
a
brother-in-law
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Honeychurches
were
a
worthy
family
,
but
he
began
to
realize
*NL*
that
Lucy
was
of
another
clay
;
and
perhaps
--
he
did
not
put
it
very
*NL*
definitely
--
he
ought
to
introduce
her
into
more
congenial
circles
as
*NL*
soon
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Beebe
!
''
said
the
maid
,
and
the
new
rector
of
Summer
Street
was
*NL*
shown
in
;
he
had
at
once
started
on
friendly
relations
,
owing
to
Lucy
's
*NL*
praise
of
him
in
her
letters
from
Florence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
greeted
him
rather
critically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
for
tea
,
Mr.
Vyse
.
Do
you
suppose
that
I
shall
get
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
so
.
Food
is
the
thing
one
does
get
here
--
Do
n't
sit
in
that
*NL*
chair
;
young
Honeychurch
has
left
a
bone
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pfui
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
said
Cecil
.
``
I
know
.
I
ca
n't
think
why
Mrs.
Honeychurch
allows
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
Cecil
considered
the
bone
and
the
Maples
'
furniture
separately
;
he
*NL*
did
not
realize
that
,
taken
together
,
they
kindled
the
room
into
the
*NL*
life
that
he
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
for
tea
and
for
gossip
.
Is
n't
this
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
News
?
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
''
said
Cecil
.
``
News
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
,
whose
news
was
of
a
very
different
nature
,
prattled
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
Sir
Harry
Otway
as
I
came
up
;
I
have
every
reason
to
hope
that
I
*NL*
am
first
in
the
field
.
He
has
bought
Cissie
and
Albert
from
Mr.
Flack
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
indeed
?
''
said
Cecil
,
trying
to
recover
himself
.
Into
what
a
*NL*
grotesque
mistake
had
he
fallen
!
Was
it
likely
that
a
clergyman
and
a
*NL*
gentleman
would
refer
to
his
engagement
in
a
manner
so
flippant
?
But
his
*NL*
stiffness
remained
,
and
,
though
he
asked
who
Cissie
and
Albert
might
be
,
*NL*
he
still
thought
Mr.
Beebe
rather
a
bounder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unpardonable
question
!
To
have
stopped
a
week
at
Windy
Corner
and
not
*NL*
to
have
met
Cissie
and
Albert
,
the
semi-detached
villas
that
have
been
*NL*
run
up
opposite
the
church
!
I
'll
set
Mrs.
Honeychurch
after
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
shockingly
stupid
over
local
affairs
,
''
said
the
young
man
*NL*
languidly
.
``
I
ca
n't
even
remember
the
difference
between
a
Parish
*NL*
Council
and
a
Local
Government
Board
.
Perhaps
there
is
no
difference
,
or
*NL*
perhaps
those
are
n't
the
right
names
.
I
only
go
into
the
country
to
see
*NL*
my
friends
and
to
enjoy
the
scenery
.
It
is
very
remiss
of
me
.
Italy
and
*NL*
London
are
the
only
places
where
I
do
n't
feel
to
exist
on
sufferance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
,
distressed
at
this
heavy
reception
of
Cissie
and
Albert
,
*NL*
determined
to
shift
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
,
Mr.
Vyse
--
I
forget
--
what
is
your
profession
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
profession
,
''
said
Cecil
.
``
It
is
another
example
of
my
*NL*
decadence
.
My
attitude
--
quite
an
indefensible
one
--
is
that
so
long
as
I
*NL*
am
no
trouble
to
any
one
I
have
a
right
to
do
as
I
like
.
I
know
I
ought
*NL*
to
be
getting
money
out
of
people
,
or
devoting
myself
to
things
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
a
straw
about
,
but
somehow
,
I
've
not
been
able
to
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
fortunate
,
''
said
Mr.
Beebe
.
``
It
is
a
wonderful
*NL*
opportunity
,
the
possession
of
leisure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
was
rather
parochial
,
but
he
did
not
quite
see
his
way
to
*NL*
answering
naturally
.
He
felt
,
as
all
who
have
regular
occupation
must
*NL*
feel
,
that
others
should
have
it
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
that
you
approve
.
I
dare
n't
face
the
healthy
person
--
for
*NL*
example
,
Freddy
Honeychurch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Freddy
's
a
good
sort
,
is
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admirable
.
The
sort
who
has
made
England
what
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
wondered
at
himself
.
Why
,
on
this
day
of
all
others
,
was
he
so
*NL*
hopelessly
contrary
?
He
tried
to
get
right
by
inquiring
effusively
after
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
's
mother
,
an
old
lady
for
whom
he
had
no
particular
regard
.
*NL*
Then
he
flattered
the
clergyman
,
praised
his
liberal-mindedness
,
his
*NL*
enlightened
attitude
towards
philosophy
and
science
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
the
others
?
''
said
Mr.
Beebe
at
last
,
``
I
insist
on
extracting
*NL*
tea
before
evening
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
Anne
never
told
them
you
were
here
.
In
this
house
one
is
so
*NL*
coached
in
the
servants
the
day
one
arrives
.
The
fault
of
Anne
is
*NL*
that
she
begs
your
pardon
when
she
hears
you
perfectly
,
and
kicks
the
*NL*
chair-legs
with
her
feet
.
The
faults
of
Mary
--
I
forget
the
faults
of
*NL*
Mary
,
but
they
are
very
grave
.
Shall
we
look
in
the
garden
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
the
faults
of
Mary
.
She
leaves
the
dust-pans
standing
on
the
*NL*
stairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fault
of
Euphemia
is
that
she
will
not

simply

not

chop
the
*NL*
suet

small

*NL*
*NL*
They
both
laughed
,
and
things
began
to
go
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
faults
of
Freddy

Cecil
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

he
has
too
many

No
one

can
remember
the
faults

the
faults
of
Miss
Honeychurch
;
they
are
not
innumerable

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
none

said
the
young
man
,
with
grave
sincerity

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
agree

At

*NL*
``
At

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
cynical

I
'm
only
thinking

my
pet
theory

Honeychurch

Does
it
seem
reasonable
that
she
should
play
so
*NL*
wonderfully
,
and
live
so
quietly
?
I
suspect
that
one
day
she
will
be
*NL*
wonderful
in
both
.
The
water-tight
compartments
in
her
will
break
down
,
*NL*
and
music
and
life
will
mingle
.
Then
we
shall
have
her
heroically
good

*NL*
heroically
bad

too
heroic
,
perhaps
,
to
be
good

bad

*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
found
his
companion
interesting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
at

you
think
her
not
wonderful
as
far
as
life
goes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
say
I
've
only
seen
her
at
Tunbridge
Wells

where
she
was
*NL*
not
wonderful
,
and
at
Florence
.
Since
I
came
to
Summer
Street
she
has
*NL*
been
away
.
You
saw
her
,
did
n't
you
,
at
Rome
and
in
the
Alps
.
Oh
,
I
*NL*
forgot
;
of
course
,
you
knew
her
before
.
No
,
she
was
n't
wonderful
in
*NL*
Florence
either
,
but
I
kept
on
expecting
that
she
would
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Conversation
had
become
agreeable
to
them
,
and
they
were
pacing
up
and
*NL*
down
the
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
as
easily
tell
you
what
tune
she
'll
play
next

There
was
simply
*NL*
the
sense
that
she
had
found
wings
,
and
meant
to
use
them
.
I
can
show
*NL*
you
a
beautiful
picture
in
my
Italian
diary
:
Miss
Honeychurch
as
a
*NL*
kite
,
Miss
Bartlett
holding
the
string
.
Picture
number
two
:
the
string
*NL*
breaks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sketch
was
in
his
diary
,
but
it
had
been
made
afterwards
,
when
he
*NL*
viewed
things
artistically
.
At
the
time
he
had
given
surreptitious
tugs
*NL*
to
the
string
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
string
never
broke
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
might
n't
have
seen
Miss
Honeychurch
rise

but
I
should
certainly
*NL*
have
heard
Miss
Bartlett
fall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
broken
now
,
''
said
the
young
man
in
low
,
vibrating
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
he
realized
that
of
all
the
conceited
,
ludicrous
,
*NL*
contemptible
ways
of
announcing
an
engagement
this
was
the
worst
.
He
*NL*
cursed
his
love
of
metaphor
;
had
he
suggested
that
he
was
a
star
and
*NL*
that
Lucy
was
soaring
up
to
reach
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Broken
?
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
,
''
said
Cecil
stiffly
,
``
that
she
is
going
to
marry
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clergyman
was
conscious
of
some
bitter
disappointment
which
he
could
*NL*
not
keep
out
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
;
I
must
apologize
.
I
had
no
idea
you
were
intimate
with
her
,
*NL*
or
I
should
never
have
talked
in
this
flippant
,
superficial
way
.
Mr.
*NL*
Vyse
,
you
ought
to
have
stopped
me
.
''
And
down
the
garden
he
saw
Lucy
*NL*
herself
;
yes
,
he
was
disappointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
,
who
naturally
preferred
congratulations
to
apologies
,
drew
down
*NL*
his
mouth
at
the
corners
.
Was
this
the
reception
his
action
would
get
*NL*
from
the
world
?
Of
course
,
he
despised
the
world
as
a
whole
;
every
*NL*
thoughtful
man
should
;
it
is
almost
a
test
of
refinement
.
But
he
was
*NL*
sensitive
to
the
successive
particles
of
it
which
he
encountered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
he
could
be
quite
crude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
I
have
given
you
a
shock
,
''
he
said
dryly
.
``
I
fear
that
*NL*
Lucy
's
choice
does
not
meet
with
your
approval
.

Not

you

I

a

Perhaps
I

*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
pulled
himself
together
.
Really
,
Mr.
Vyse
had
the
art
of
*NL*
placing
one
in
the
most
tiresome
positions
.
He
was
driven
to
use
the
*NL*
prerogatives
of
his
profession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
said
nothing
indiscreet
.
I
foresaw
at
Florence
that
her
*NL*
quiet
,
uneventful
childhood
must
end
,
and
it
has
ended
.
I
realized
dimly
*NL*
enough
that
she
might
take
some
momentous
step
.
She
has
taken
it
.
She
*NL*
has
learnt
--
you
will
let
me
talk
freely
,
as
I
have
begun
freely
--
she
has
*NL*
learnt
what
it
is
to
love
:
the
greatest
lesson

some
people
will
tell
*NL*
you
,
that
our
earthly
life
provides

''
It
was
now
time
for
him
to
wave
*NL*
his
hat
at
the
approaching
trio
.
He
did
not
omit
to
do
so
.
``
She
has
*NL*
learnt
through
you
,
''
and
if
his
voice
was
still
clerical
,
it
was
now
*NL*
also
sincere
;
``
let
it
be
your
care
that
her
knowledge
is
profitable
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grazie

''
said
Cecil
,
who
did
not
like
parsons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
?
''
shouted
Mrs.
Honeychurch
as
she
toiled
up
the
sloping
*NL*
garden
.
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Beebe
,
have
you
heard
the
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Freddy
,
now
full
of
geniality
,
whistled
the
wedding
march
.
Youth
seldom
*NL*
criticizes
the
accomplished
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
have
!
''
he
cried
.
He
looked
at
Lucy
.
In
her
presence
he
could
*NL*
not
act
the
parson
any
longer
--
at
all
events
not
without
apology
.
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
I
'm
going
to
do
what
I
am
always
supposed
to
do
,
but
*NL*
generally
I
'm
too
shy
.
I
want
to
invoke
every
kind
of
blessing
on
*NL*
them
,
grave
and
gay
,
great
and
small
.
I
want
them
all
their
lives
to
be
*NL*
supremely
good
and
supremely
happy
as
husband
and
wife
,
as
father
and
*NL*
mother
.
And
now
I
want
my
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
only
asked
for
it
just
in
time
,
''
the
lady
retorted
.
``
How
dare
you
*NL*
be
serious
at
Windy
Corner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
tone
from
her
.
There
was
no
more
heavy
beneficence
,
no
more
*NL*
attempts
to
dignify
the
situation
with
poetry
or
the
Scriptures
.
None
of
*NL*
them
dared
or
was
able
to
be
serious
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
engagement
is
so
potent
a
thing
that
sooner
or
later
it
reduces
all
*NL*
who
speak
of
it
to
this
state
of
cheerful
awe
.
Away
from
it
,
in
the
*NL*
solitude
of
their
rooms
,
Mr.
Beebe
,
and
even
Freddy
,
might
again
be
*NL*
critical
.
But
in
its
presence
and
in
the
presence
of
each
other
they
*NL*
were
sincerely
hilarious
.
It
has
a
strange
power
,
for
it
compels
not
*NL*
only
the
lips
,
but
the
very
heart
.
The
chief
parallel
to
compare
one
*NL*
great
thing
with
another
--
is
the
power
over
us
of
a
temple
of
some
alien
*NL*
creed
.
Standing
outside
,
we
deride
or
oppose
it
,
or
at
the
most
feel
*NL*
sentimental
.
Inside
,
though
the
saints
and
gods
are
not
ours
,
we
become
*NL*
true
believers
,
in
case
any
true
believer
should
be
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
was
that
after
the
gropings
and
the
misgivings
of
the
afternoon
*NL*
they
pulled
themselves
together
and
settled
down
to
a
very
pleasant
*NL*
tea-party
.
If
they
were
hypocrites
they
did
not
know
it
,
and
their
*NL*
hypocrisy
had
every
chance
of
setting
and
of
becoming
true
.
Anne
,
*NL*
putting
down
each
plate
as
if
it
were
a
wedding
present
,
stimulated
them
*NL*
greatly
.
They
could
not
lag
behind
that
smile
of
hers
which
she
gave
*NL*
them
ere
she
kicked
the
drawing-room
door
.
Mr.
Beebe
chirruped
.
Freddy
*NL*
was
at
his
wittiest
,
referring
to
Cecil
as
the
``
Fiasco
''
--
family
honoured
*NL*
pun
on
fiance
.
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
amusing
and
portly
,
promised
well
as
*NL*
a
mother-in-law
.
As
for
Lucy
and
Cecil
,
for
whom
the
temple
had
been
*NL*
built
,
they
also
joined
in
the
merry
ritual
,
but
waited
,
as
earnest
*NL*
worshippers
should
,
for
the
disclosure
of
some
holier
shrine
of
joy
.

Chapter
IX
:
Lucy
As
a
Work
of
Art
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
after
the
engagement
was
announced
Mrs.
Honeychurch
made
Lucy
*NL*
and
her
Fiasco
come
to
a
little
garden-party
in
the
neighbourhood
,
for
*NL*
naturally
she
wanted
to
show
people
that
her
daughter
was
marrying
a
*NL*
presentable
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
was
more
than
presentable
;
he
looked
distinguished
,
and
it
was
*NL*
very
pleasant
to
see
his
slim
figure
keeping
step
with
Lucy
,
and
his
*NL*
long
,
fair
face
responding
when
Lucy
spoke
to
him
.
People
congratulated
*NL*
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
which
is
,
I
believe
,
a
social
blunder
,
but
it
pleased
*NL*
her
,
and
she
introduced
Cecil
rather
indiscriminately
to
some
stuffy
*NL*
dowagers
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
tea
a
misfortune
took
place
:
a
cup
of
coffee
was
upset
over
Lucy
's
*NL*
figured
silk
,
and
though
Lucy
feigned
indifference
,
her
mother
feigned
*NL*
nothing
of
the
sort
but
dragged
her
indoors
to
have
the
frock
treated
*NL*
by
a
sympathetic
maid
.
They
were
gone
some
time
,
and
Cecil
was
left
with
*NL*
the
dowagers
.
When
they
returned
he
was
not
as
pleasant
as
he
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
go
to
much
of
this
sort
of
thing
?
''
he
asked
when
they
were
*NL*
driving
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
now
and
then
,
''
said
Lucy
,
who
had
rather
enjoyed
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
typical
of
country
society
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
.
Mother
,
would
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Plenty
of
society
,
''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
who
was
trying
to
remember
*NL*
the
hang
of
one
of
the
dresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere
,
Cecil
bent
towards
Lucy
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
me
it
seemed
perfectly
appalling
,
disastrous
,
portentous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
sorry
that
you
were
stranded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
,
but
the
congratulations
.
It
is
so
disgusting
,
the
way
an
*NL*
engagement
is
regarded
as
public
property
--
a
kind
of
waste
place
where
*NL*
every
outsider
may
shoot
his
vulgar
sentiment
.
All
those
old
women
*NL*
smirking
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
has
to
go
through
it
,
I
suppose
.
They
wo
n't
notice
us
so
much
next
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
point
is
that
their
whole
attitude
is
wrong
.
An
*NL*
engagement
--
horrid
word
in
the
first
place
--
is
a
private
matter
,
and
*NL*
should
be
treated
as
such
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
the
smirking
old
women
,
however
wrong
individually
,
were
racially
*NL*
correct
.
The
spirit
of
the
generations
had
smiled
through
them
,
*NL*
rejoicing
in
the
engagement
of
Cecil
and
Lucy
because
it
promised
the
*NL*
continuance
of
life
on
earth
.
To
Cecil
and
Lucy
it
promised
something
*NL*
quite
different
--
personal
love
.
Hence
Cecil
's
irritation
and
Lucy
's
*NL*
belief
that
his
irritation
was
just
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
tiresome
!
''
she
said
.
``
Could
n't
you
have
escaped
to
tennis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
play
tennis
--
at
least
,
not
in
public
.
The
neighbourhood
is
*NL*
deprived
of
the
romance
of
me
being
athletic
.
Such
romance
as
I
have
is
*NL*
that
of
the
Inglese
Italianato
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inglese
Italianato
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
E
un
diavolo
incarnato
!
You
know
the
proverb
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
.
Nor
did
it
seem
applicable
to
a
young
man
who
had
spent
a
*NL*
quiet
winter
in
Rome
with
his
mother
.
But
Cecil
,
since
his
engagement
,
*NL*
had
taken
to
affect
a
cosmopolitan
naughtiness
which
he
was
far
from
*NL*
possessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
can
not
help
it
if
they
do
disapprove
of
me
.
There
*NL*
are
certain
irremovable
barriers
between
myself
and
them
,
and
I
must
*NL*
accept
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
all
have
our
limitations
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
wise
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
they
are
forced
on
us
,
though
,
''
said
Cecil
,
who
saw
from
her
*NL*
remark
that
she
did
not
quite
understand
his
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
makes
a
difference
does
n't
it
,
whether
we
fully
fence
ourselves
in
,
*NL*
or
whether
we
are
fenced
out
by
the
barriers
of
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
a
moment
,
and
agreed
that
it
did
make
a
difference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Difference
?
''
cried
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
suddenly
alert
.
``
I
do
n't
see
any
*NL*
difference

Fences
are
fences
,
especially
when
they
are
in
the
same
*NL*
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
speaking
of
motives
,
''
said
Cecil
,
on
whom
the
interruption
*NL*
jarred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Cecil
,
look
here
.
''
She
spread
out
her
knees
and
perched
her
*NL*
card-case
on
her
lap
.
``
This
is
me
.
That
's
Windy
Corner
.
The
rest
of
the
*NL*
pattern
is
the
other
people

Motives
are
all
very
well
,
but
the
fence
*NL*
comes
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
n't
talking
of
real
fences
,
''
said
Lucy
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
see
,
dear
--
poetry

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
leant
placidly
back
.
Cecil
wondered
why
Lucy
had
been
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
who
has
no
`
fences
,
'
as
you
call
them
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
*NL*
that
's
Mr.
Beebe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

fenceless
would
mean
a
parson
defenceless

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
slow
to
follow
what
people
said
,
but
quick
enough
to
detect
*NL*
what
they
meant
.
She
missed
Cecil
's
epigram
,
but
grasped
the
feeling
*NL*
that
prompted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
like
Mr.
Beebe
?
''
she
asked
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
said
so
!
''
he
cried
.
``
I
consider
him
far
above
the
average
.
I
*NL*
only
denied
--
''
And
he
swept
off
on
the
subject
of
fences
again
,
and
was
*NL*
brilliant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
a
clergyman
that
I
do
hate

''
said
she
wanting
to
say
something
*NL*
sympathetic
,
``
a
clergyman
that
does
have
fences
,
and
the
most
dreadful
*NL*
ones
,
is
Mr.
Eager
,
the
English
chaplain
at
Florence
.
He
was
truly
*NL*
insincere
--
not
merely
the
manner
unfortunate
.
He
was
a
snob
,
and
so
*NL*
conceited
,
and
he
did
say
such
unkind
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
things

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
an
old

Bertolini

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps

*NL*

``

Cecil
laughed
at
her
feminine
inconsequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
try
to
sift
the
thing

Mr.
Eager
would
never
come
to
the

point

He
prefers
it
vague
--
said
the
old
man
had
`
practically

murdered

his

--
had
murdered
her
in

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
absently

*NL*
*NL*
``

is
n't
it
intolerable
that

spreading
slander
?
It
was
,
I
believe
,
chiefly
owing
to
*NL*
him
that
the
old
man
was
dropped
.
People
pretended
he
was
vulgar
,
but
he
*NL*
certainly
was
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor

was

glibly

``
Let

said
her
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
nodded
intelligently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
Mr.
Eager
a
parson
of
the
cultured
type

he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

nature

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
goodness
gracious
me

said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
.
``
You
'll
blow
*NL*
my
head
off

Whatever
is
there
to
shout
over
?
I
forbid
you
and
Cecil
to
*NL*
hate
any
more
clergymen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
.
There
was
indeed
something
rather
incongruous
in
Lucy
's
moral
*NL*
outburst
over
Mr.
Eager
.
It
was
as
if
one
should
see
the
Leonardo
on
the
*NL*
ceiling
of
the
Sistine
.
He
longed
to
hint
to
her
that
not
here
lay
*NL*
her
vocation
;
that
a
woman
's
power
and
charm
reside
in
mystery
,
not
*NL*
in
muscular
rant
.
But
possibly
rant
is
a
sign
of
vitality
:
it
mars
the
*NL*
beautiful
creature
,
but
shows
that
she
is
alive
.
After
a
moment
,
he
*NL*
contemplated
her
flushed
face
and
excited
gestures
with
a
certain
*NL*
approval
.
He
forebore
to
repress
the
sources
of
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nature
--
simplest
of
topics
,
he
thought
--
lay
around
them
.
He
praised
the
*NL*
pine-woods
,
the
deep
lasts
of
bracken
,
the
crimson
leaves
that
spotted
*NL*
the
hurt-bushes
,
the
serviceable
beauty
of
the
turnpike
road
.
The
*NL*
outdoor
world
was
not
very
familiar
to
him
,
and
occasionally
he
went
*NL*
wrong
in
a
question
of
fact
.
Mrs.
Honeychurch
's
mouth
twitched
when
he
*NL*
spoke
of
the
perpetual
green
of
the
larch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
count
myself
a
lucky
person
,
''
he
concluded
,
``
When
I
'm
in
London
I
*NL*
feel
I
could
never
live
out
of
it
.
When
I
'm
in
the
country
I
feel
the
*NL*
same
about
the
country
.
After
all
,
I
do
believe
that
birds
and
trees
and
*NL*
the
sky
are
the
most
wonderful
things
in
life
,
and
that
the
people
who
*NL*
live
amongst
them
must
be
the
best
.
It
's
true
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
*NL*
ten
they
do
n't
seem
to
notice
anything
.
The
country
gentleman
and
*NL*
the
country
labourer
are
each
in
their
way
the
most
depressing
of
*NL*
companions
.
Yet
they
may
have
a
tacit
sympathy
with
the
workings
*NL*
of
Nature
which
is
denied
to
us
of
the
town
.
Do
you
feel
that
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Honeychurch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Honeychurch
started
and
smiled
.
She
had
not
been
attending
.
*NL*
Cecil
,
who
was
rather
crushed
on
the
front
seat
of
the
victoria
,
felt
*NL*
irritable
,
and
determined
not
to
say
anything
interesting
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
had
not
attended
either
.
Her
brow
was
wrinkled
,
and
she
still
*NL*
looked
furiously
cross
--
the
result
,
he
concluded
,
of
too
much
moral
*NL*
gymnastics
.
It
was
sad
to
see
her
thus
blind
to
the
beauties
of
an
*NL*
August
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Come
down
,
O
maid
,
from
yonder
mountain
height
,
'
''
he
quoted
,
and
*NL*
touched
her
knee
with
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
again
and
said
:
``
What
height
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Come
down
,
O
maid
,
from
yonder
mountain
height
,
What
pleasure
lives
*NL*
in
height
-LRB-
the
shepherd
sang
-RRB-
.
In
height
and
in
the
splendour
of
the
*NL*
hills
?
'
Let
us
take
Mrs.
Honeychurch
's
advice
and
hate
clergymen
no
*NL*
more
.
What
's
this
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Summer
Street
,
of
course
,
''
said
Lucy
,
and
roused
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woods
had
opened
to
leave
space
for
a
sloping
triangular
meadow
.
*NL*
Pretty
cottages
lined
it
on
two
sides
,
and
the
upper
and
third
side
was
*NL*
occupied
by
a
new
stone
church
,
expensively
simple
,
a
charming
shingled
*NL*
spire
.
Mr.
Beebe
's
house
was
near
the
church
.
In
height
it
scarcely
*NL*
exceeded
the
cottages
.
Some
great
mansions
were
at
hand
,
but
they
were
*NL*
hidden
in
the
trees
.
The
scene
suggested
a
Swiss
Alp
rather
than
the
*NL*
shrine
and
centre
of
a
leisured
world
,
and
was
marred
only
by
two
ugly
*NL*
little
villas
--
the
villas
that
had
competed
with
Cecil
's
engagement
,
*NL*
having
been
acquired
by
Sir
Harry
Otway
the
very
afternoon
that
Lucy
had
*NL*
been
acquired
by
Cecil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cissie
''
was
the
name
of
one
of
these
villas
,
``
Albert
''
of
the
other
.
*NL*
These
titles
were
not
only
picked
out
in
shaded
Gothic
on
the
garden
*NL*
gates
,
but
appeared
a
second
time
on
the
porches
,
where
they
followed
*NL*
the
semicircular
curve
of
the
entrance
arch
in
block
capitals
.
``
Albert
''
*NL*
was
inhabited
.
His
tortured
garden
was
bright
with
geraniums
and
*NL*
lobelias
and
polished
shells
.
His
little
windows
were
chastely
swathed
*NL*
in
Nottingham
lace
.
``
Cissie
''
was
to
let
.
Three
notice-boards
,
belonging
*NL*
to
Dorking
agents
,
lolled
on
her
fence
and
announced
the
not
surprising
*NL*
fact
.
Her
paths
were
already
weedy
;
her
pocket-handkerchief
of
a
lawn
*NL*
was
yellow
with
dandelions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
place
is
ruined
!
''
said
the
ladies
mechanically
.
``
Summer
Street
will
*NL*
never
be
the
same
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
carriage
passed
,
``
Cissie
's
''
door
opened
,
and
a
gentleman
came
out
*NL*
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
touching
the
coachman
with
her
parasol
.
*NL*
``
Here
's
Sir
Harry
.
Now
we
shall
know
.
Sir
Harry
,
pull
those
things
down
*NL*
at
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Harry
Otway
--
who
need
not
be
described
--
came
to
the
carriage
and
*NL*
said
``
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
I
meant
to
.
I
ca
n't
,
I
really
ca
n't
turn
out
*NL*
Miss
Flack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
not
always
right
?
She
ought
to
have
gone
before
the
contract
was
*NL*
signed
.
Does
she
still
live
rent
free
,
as
she
did
in
her
nephew
's
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
can
I
do
?
''
He
lowered
his
voice
.
``
An
old
lady
,
so
very
vulgar
,
*NL*
and
almost
bedridden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Turn
her
out
,
''
said
Cecil
bravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Harry
sighed
,
and
looked
at
the
villas
mournfully
.
He
had
had
full
*NL*
warning
of
Mr.
Flack
's
intentions
,
and
might
have
bought
the
plot
before
*NL*
building
commenced
:
but
he
was
apathetic
and
dilatory
.
He
had
known
*NL*
Summer
Street
for
so
many
years
that
he
could
not
imagine
it
being
*NL*
spoilt
.
Not
till
Mrs.
Flack
had
laid
the
foundation
stone
,
and
the
*NL*
apparition
of
red
and
cream
brick
began
to
rise
did
he
take
alarm
.
*NL*
He
called
on
Mr.
Flack
,
the
local
builder
,
--
a
most
reasonable
and
*NL*
respectful
man
--
who
agreed
that
tiles
would
have
made
more
artistic
*NL*
roof
,
but
pointed
out
that
slates
were
cheaper
.
He
ventured
to
differ
,
*NL*
however
,
about
the
Corinthian
columns
which
were
to
cling
like
leeches
*NL*
to
the
frames
of
the
bow
windows
,
saying
that
,
for
his
part
,
he
liked
*NL*
to
relieve
the
facade
by
a
bit
of
decoration
.
Sir
Harry
hinted
that
a
*NL*
column
,
if
possible
,
should
be
structural
as
well
as
decorative
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Flack
replied
that
all
the
columns
had
been
ordered
,
adding
,
``
and
*NL*
all
the
capitals
different
--
one
with
dragons
in
the
foliage
,
another
*NL*
approaching
to
the
Ionian
style
,
another
introducing
Mrs.
Flack
's
*NL*
initials
--
everyone
different
.
''
For
he
had
read
his
Ruskin
.
He
built
*NL*
his
villas
according
to
his
desire
;
and
not
until
he
had
inserted
an
*NL*
immovable
aunt
into
one
of
them
did
Sir
Harry
buy
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
futile
and
unprofitable
transaction
filled
the
knight
with
sadness
*NL*
as
he
leant
on
Mrs.
Honeychurch
's
carriage
.
He
had
failed
in
his
duties
*NL*
to
the
country-side
,
and
the
country-side
was
laughing
at
him
as
well
.
*NL*
He
had
spent
money
,
and
yet
Summer
Street
was
spoilt
as
much
as
ever
.
*NL*
All
he
could
do
now
was
to
find
a
desirable
tenant
for
``
Cissie
''
--
some
*NL*
one
really
desirable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rent
is
absurdly
low
,
''
he
told
them
,
``
and
perhaps
I
am
an
easy
*NL*
landlord
.
But
it
is
such
an
awkward
size
.
It
is
too
large
for
the
*NL*
peasant
class
and
too
small
for
any
one
the
least
like
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
had
been
hesitating
whether
he
should
despise
the
villas
or
*NL*
despise
Sir
Harry
for
despising
them
.
The
latter
impulse
seemed
the
more
*NL*
fruitful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
find
a
tenant
at
once
,
''
he
said
maliciously
.
``
It
would
be
*NL*
a
perfect
paradise
for
a
bank
clerk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
!
''
said
Sir
Harry
excitedly
.
``
That
is
exactly
what
I
fear
,
Mr.
*NL*
Vyse
.
It
will
attract
the
wrong
type
of
people
.
The
train
service
has
*NL*
improved
--
a
fatal
improvement
,
to
my
mind
.
And
what
are
five
miles
from
*NL*
a
station
in
these
days
of
bicycles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
a
strenuous
clerk
it
would
be
,
''
said
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
,
who
had
his
full
share
of
mediaeval
mischievousness
,
replied
*NL*
that
the
physique
of
the
lower
middle
classes
was
improving
at
a
*NL*
most
appalling
rate
.
She
saw
that
he
was
laughing
at
their
harmless
*NL*
neighbour
,
and
roused
herself
to
stop
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Harry
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
I
have
an
idea
.
How
would
you
like
*NL*
spinsters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Lucy
,
it
would
be
splendid
.
Do
you
know
any
such
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
met
them
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlewomen
?
''
he
asked
tentatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
and
at
the
present
moment
homeless
.
I
heard
from
them
last
*NL*
week
--
Miss
Teresa
and
Miss
Catharine
Alan
.
I
'm
really
not
joking
.
They
*NL*
are
quite
the
right
people
.
Mr.
Beebe
knows
them
,
too
.
May
I
tell
them
*NL*
to
write
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
may
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Here
we
are
with
the
difficulty
solved
*NL*
already

How
delightful
it
is
!
Extra
facilities
--
please
tell
them
they
*NL*
shall
have
extra
facilities
,
for
I
shall
have
no
agents

fees
.
Oh
,
*NL*
the
agents
!
The
appalling
people
they
have
sent
me
!
One
woman
,
when
*NL*
I
wrote
--
a
tactful
letter
,
you
know
--
asking
her
to
explain
her
social
*NL*
position
to
me
,
replied
that
she
would
pay
the
rent
in
advance
.
As
*NL*
if
one
cares
about
that
!
And
several
references
I
took
up
were
most
*NL*
unsatisfactory
--
people
swindlers
,
or
not
respectable
.
And
oh
,
the
*NL*
deceit
!
I
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
seamy
side
this
last
week
.
The
*NL*
deceit
of
the
most
promising
people
.
My
dear
Lucy
,
the
deceit
!

*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
advice
,
''
put
in
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
``
is
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
Lucy
and
her
decayed
gentlewomen
at
all
.
I
know
the
type
.
Preserve
me
*NL*
from
people
who
have
seen
better
days
,
and
bring
heirlooms
with
them
*NL*
that
make
the
house
smell
stuffy
.
It
's
a
sad
thing
,
but
I
'd
far
rather
*NL*
let
to
someone
who
is
going
up
in
the
world
than
to
someone
who
has
*NL*
come
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
follow
you
,
''
said
Sir
Harry
;
``
but
it
is
,
as
you
say
,
a
very
*NL*
sad
thing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Misses
Alan
are
n't
that
!
''
cried
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
are
,
''
said
Cecil
.
``
I
have
n't
met
them
but
I
should
say
they

were
a
highly
unsuitable
addition
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
listen

Sir
Harry
--
he
's
tiresome

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

he
replied
.
``
I
ought
n't
to
come
with
my
*NL*
troubles
to
young
people

But
really
I
am
so
worried
,
and
Lady
Otway
*NL*
will
only
say
that
I
can
not
be
too
careful
,
which
is
quite
true
,
but
no

real
help

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
may
I
write
to
my
Misses
Alan

*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
!

*NL*
*NL*
But
his
eye
wavered
when
Mrs.
Honeychurch
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beware
!
They
are
certain
to
have
canaries
.
Sir
Harry
,
beware
of
*NL*
canaries

they
spit
the
seed
out
through
the
bars
of
the
cages
and
then
*NL*
the
mice
come
.
Beware
of
women
altogether
.
Only
let
to
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
--
''
he
murmured
gallantly
,
though
he
saw
the
wisdom
of
her
*NL*
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
do
n't
gossip
over
tea-cups

If
they
get
drunk
,
there
's
an
end
of
*NL*
them
--
they
lie
down
comfortably
and
sleep
it
off
.
If
they
're
vulgar
,
*NL*
they
somehow
keep
it
to
themselves
.
It
does
n't
spread
so
.
Give
me
a
*NL*
man

of
course
,
provided
he
's
clean

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Harry
blushed
.
Neither
he
nor
Cecil
enjoyed
these
open
compliments
*NL*
to
their
sex
.
Even
the
exclusion
of
the
dirty
did
not
leave
them
much
*NL*
distinction
.
He
suggested
that
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
if
she
had
time
,
should
*NL*
descend
from
the
carriage
and
inspect
``
Cissie
''
for
herself
.
She
was
*NL*
delighted
.
Nature
had
intended
her
to
be
poor
and
to
live
in
such
a
*NL*
house
.
Domestic
arrangements
always
attracted
her
,
especially
when
they
*NL*
were
on
a
small
scale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
pulled
Lucy
back
as
she
followed
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
''
he
said
,
``
what
if
we
two
walk
home
and
leave
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
!
''
was
her
cordial
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Harry
likewise
seemed
almost
too
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
.
He
beamed
*NL*
at
them
knowingly
,
said
,
``
Aha
!
young
people
,
young
people
!
''
and
then
*NL*
hastened
to
unlock
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hopeless
vulgarian
!
''
exclaimed
Cecil
,
almost
before
they
were
out
of
*NL*
earshot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Cecil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
It
would
be
wrong
not
to
loathe
that
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

all
that
is
bad
in
country
life
.
In
London
he
*NL*
would
keep
his
place
.
He
would
belong
to
a
brainless
club
,
and
his
wife
*NL*
would
give
brainless
dinner
parties
.
But
down
here
he
acts
the
little
*NL*
god
with
his
gentility
,
and
his
patronage
,
and
his
sham
aesthetics
,
and
*NL*
everyone
--
even
your
mother
--
is
taken
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
you
say
is
quite
true
,
''
said
Lucy
,
though
she
felt
*NL*
discouraged
.
``
I
wonder
whether
--
whether
it
matters
so
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
matters
supremely
.
Sir
Harry
is
the
essence
of
that
garden-party
.
*NL*
Oh
,
goodness
,
how
cross
I
feel
!
How
I
do
hope
he
'll
get
some
vulgar
*NL*
tenant
in
that
villa
--
some
woman
so
really
vulgar
that
he
'll
notice
*NL*
it
.
GENTLEFOLKS
!
Ugh
!
with
his
bald
head
and
retreating
chin
!
But
let
's
*NL*
forget
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
Lucy
was
glad
enough
to
do
.
If
Cecil
disliked
Sir
Harry
Otway
and
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
,
what
guarantee
was
there
that
the
people
who
really
mattered
*NL*
to
her
would
escape
?
For
instance
,
Freddy
.
Freddy
was
neither
clever
,
*NL*
nor
subtle
,
nor
beautiful
,
and
what
prevented
Cecil
from
saying
,
any
*NL*
minute
,
``
It
would
be
wrong
not
to
loathe
Freddy
''
?
And
what
would
she
*NL*
reply
?
Further
than
Freddy
she
did
not
go
,
but
he
gave
her
anxiety
*NL*
enough
.
She
could
only
assure
herself
that
Cecil
had
known
Freddy
some
*NL*
time
,
and
that
they
had
always
got
on
pleasantly
,
except
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
during
the
last
few
days
,
which
was
an
accident
,
perhaps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
way
shall
we
go
?
''
she
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nature
--
simplest
of
topics
,
she
thought
--
was
around
them
.
Summer
Street
*NL*
lay
deep
in
the
woods
,
and
she
had
stopped
where
a
footpath
diverged
*NL*
from
the
highroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
two
ways
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
the
road
is
more
sensible
,
as
we
're
got
up
smart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
go
through
the
wood
,
''
said
Cecil
,
With
that
subdued
*NL*
irritation
that
she
had
noticed
in
him
all
the
afternoon
.
``
Why
is
it
,
*NL*
Lucy
,
that
you
always
say
the
road
?
Do
you
know
that
you
have
never
once
*NL*
been
with
me
in
the
fields
or
the
wood
since
we
were
engaged
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
I
?
The
wood
,
then
,
''
said
Lucy
,
startled
at
his
queerness
,
but
*NL*
pretty
sure
that
he
would
explain
later
;
it
was
not
his
habit
to
leave
*NL*
her
in
doubt
as
to
his
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
led
the
way
into
the
whispering
pines
,
and
sure
enough
he
did
*NL*
explain
before
they
had
gone
a
dozen
yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
got
an
idea
--
I
dare
say
wrongly
--
that
you
feel
more
at
home
with
*NL*
me
in
a
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
room
?
''
she
echoed
,
hopelessly
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Or
,
at
the
most
,
in
a
garden
,
or
on
a
road
.
Never
in
the
real
*NL*
country
like
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Cecil
,
whatever
do
you
mean
?
I
have
never
felt
anything
of
the
*NL*
sort
.
You
talk
as
if
I
was
a
kind
of
poetess
sort
of
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
you
are
n't
.
I
connect
you
with
a
view
--
a
certain
type
*NL*
of
view
.
Why
should
n't
you
connect
me
with
a
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
reflected
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
laughing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
that
you
're
right
?
I
do
.
I
must
be
a
poetess
after
all
.
*NL*
When
I
think
of
you
it
's
always
as
in
a
room
.
How
funny
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
her
surprise
,
he
seemed
annoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
drawing-room
,
pray
?
With
no
view
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
with
no
view
,
I
fancy
.
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
,
''
he
said
reproachfully
,
``
that
you
connected
me
with
the
open
*NL*
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
again
,
``
Oh
,
Cecil
,
whatever
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
no
explanation
was
forthcoming
,
she
shook
off
the
subject
as
too
*NL*
difficult
for
a
girl
,
and
led
him
further
into
the
wood
,
pausing
every
*NL*
now
and
then
at
some
particularly
beautiful
or
familiar
combination
of
*NL*
the
trees
.
She
had
known
the
wood
between
Summer
Street
and
Windy
Corner
*NL*
ever
since
she
could
walk
alone
;
she
had
played
at
losing
Freddy
in
it
,
*NL*
when
Freddy
was
a
purple-faced
baby
;
and
though
she
had
been
to
Italy
,
*NL*
it
had
lost
none
of
its
charm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
they
came
to
a
little
clearing
among
the
pines
--
another
tiny
*NL*
green
alp
,
solitary
this
time
,
and
holding
in
its
bosom
a
shallow
pool
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
exclaimed
,
``
The
Sacred
Lake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
call
it
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
remember
why
.
I
suppose
it
comes
out
of
some
book
.
It
's
only
a
*NL*
puddle
now
,
but
you
see
that
stream
going
through
it
?
Well
,
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
water
comes
down
after
heavy
rains
,
and
ca
n't
get
away
at
once
,
and
*NL*
the
pool
becomes
quite
large
and
beautiful
.
Then
Freddy
used
to
bathe
*NL*
there
.
He
is
very
fond
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
meant
,
``
Are
you
fond
of
it
?
''
But
she
answered
dreamily
,
``
I
bathed
*NL*
here
,
too
,
till
I
was
found
out
.
Then
there
was
a
row
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
another
time
he
might
have
been
shocked
,
for
he
had
depths
of
*NL*
prudishness
within
him
.
But
now
?
with
his
momentary
cult
of
the
fresh
*NL*
air
,
he
was
delighted
at
her
admirable
simplicity
.
He
looked
at
her
as
*NL*
she
stood
by
the
pool
's
edge
.
She
was
got
up
smart
,
as
she
phrased
it
,
*NL*
and
she
reminded
him
of
some
brilliant
flower
that
has
no
leaves
of
its
*NL*
own
,
but
blooms
abruptly
out
of
a
world
of
green
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
found
you
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charlotte
,
''
she
murmured
.
``
She
was
stopping
with
us
.
*NL*
Charlotte
--
Charlotte
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
gravely
.
A
certain
scheme
,
from
which
hitherto
he
had
shrunk
,
*NL*
now
appeared
practical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
suppose
we
ought
to
be
going
,
''
was
her
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
,
I
want
to
ask
something
of
you
that
I
have
never
asked
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
serious
note
in
his
voice
she
stepped
frankly
and
kindly
towards
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Cecil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hitherto
never
--
not
even
that
day
on
the
lawn
when
you
agreed
to
marry
*NL*
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
self-conscious
and
kept
glancing
round
to
see
if
they
were
*NL*
observed
.
His
courage
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
to
now
I
have
never
kissed
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
as
scarlet
as
if
he
had
put
the
thing
most
indelicately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
more
you
have
,
''
she
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
ask
you
--
may
I
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
you
may
,
Cecil
.
You
might
before
.
I
ca
n't
run
at
you
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
supreme
moment
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
absurdities
.
Her
*NL*
reply
was
inadequate
.
She
gave
such
a
business-like
lift
to
her
veil
.
*NL*
As
he
approached
her
he
found
time
to
wish
that
he
could
recoil
.
As
*NL*
he
touched
her
,
his
gold
pince-nez
became
dislodged
and
was
flattened
*NL*
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
embrace
.
He
considered
,
with
truth
,
that
it
had
been
a
*NL*
failure
.
Passion
should
believe
itself
irresistible
.
It
should
forget
*NL*
civility
and
consideration
and
all
the
other
curses
of
a
refined
nature
.
*NL*
Above
all
,
it
should
never
ask
for
leave
where
there
is
a
right
of
way
.
*NL*
Why
could
he
not
do
as
any
labourer
or
navvy
--
nay
,
as
any
young
man
*NL*
behind
the
counter
would
have
done
?
He
recast
the
scene
.
Lucy
was
*NL*
standing
flowerlike
by
the
water
,
he
rushed
up
and
took
her
in
his
*NL*
arms
;
she
rebuked
him
,
permitted
him
and
revered
him
ever
after
for
his
*NL*
manliness
.
For
he
believed
that
women
revere
men
for
their
manliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
left
the
pool
in
silence
,
after
this
one
salutation
.
He
waited
for
*NL*
her
to
make
some
remark
which
should
show
him
her
inmost
thoughts
.
At
*NL*
last
she
spoke
,
and
with
fitting
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emerson
was
the
name
,
not
Harris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
man
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
old
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
old
man
I
told
you
about
.
The
one
Mr.
Eager
was
so
unkind
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
know
that
this
was
the
most
intimate
conversation
they
had
*NL*
ever
had
.

*NL*
Chapter
X
:
Cecil
as
a
Humourist
*NL*
*NL*
The
society
out
of
which
Cecil
proposed
to
rescue
Lucy
was
perhaps
no
*NL*
very
splendid
affair
,
yet
it
was
more
splendid
than
her
antecedents
*NL*
entitled
her
to
.
Her
father
,
a
prosperous
local
solicitor
,
had
built
*NL*
Windy
Corner
,
as
a
speculation
at
the
time
the
district
was
opening
up
,
*NL*
and
,
falling
in
love
with
his
own
creation
,
had
ended
by
living
there
*NL*
himself
.
Soon
after
his
marriage
the
social
atmosphere
began
to
alter
.
*NL*
Other
houses
were
built
on
the
brow
of
that
steep
southern
slope
and
*NL*
others
,
again
,
among
the
pine-trees
behind
,
and
northward
on
the
chalk
*NL*
barrier
of
the
downs
.
Most
of
these
houses
were
larger
than
Windy
*NL*
Corner
,
and
were
filled
by
people
who
came
,
not
from
the
district
,
but
*NL*
from
London
,
and
who
mistook
the
Honeychurches
for
the
remnants
of
an
*NL*
indigenous
aristocracy
.
He
was
inclined
to
be
frightened
,
but
his
wife
*NL*
accepted
the
situation
without
either
pride
or
humility
.
``
I
can
not
think
*NL*
what
people
are
doing
,
''
she
would
say
,
``
but
it
is
extremely
fortunate
*NL*
for
the
children
.
''
She
called
everywhere
;
her
calls
were
returned
with
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
and
by
the
time
people
found
out
that
she
was
not
exactly
*NL*
of
their
milieu
,
they
liked
her
,
and
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
.
When
Mr.
*NL*
Honeychurch
died
,
he
had
the
satisfaction
--
which
few
honest
solicitors
*NL*
despise
--
of
leaving
his
family
rooted
in
the
best
society
obtainable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
best
obtainable
.
Certainly
many
of
the
immigrants
were
rather
*NL*
dull
,
and
Lucy
realized
this
more
vividly
since
her
return
from
Italy
.
*NL*
Hitherto
she
had
accepted
their
ideals
without
questioning
--
their
kindly
*NL*
affluence
,
their
inexplosive
religion
,
their
dislike
of
paper-bags
,
*NL*
orange-peel
,
and
broken
bottles
.
A
Radical
out
and
out
,
she
learnt
to
*NL*
speak
with
horror
of
Suburbia
.
Life
,
so
far
as
she
troubled
to
conceive
*NL*
it
,
was
a
circle
of
rich
,
pleasant
people
,
with
identical
interests
and
*NL*
identical
foes
.
In
this
circle
,
one
thought
,
married
,
and
died
.
Outside
*NL*
it
were
poverty
and
vulgarity
for
ever
trying
to
enter
,
just
as
the
*NL*
London
fog
tries
to
enter
the
pine-woods
pouring
through
the
gaps
in
*NL*
the
northern
hills
.
But
,
in
Italy
,
where
any
one
who
chooses
may
warm
*NL*
himself
in
equality
,
as
in
the
sun
,
this
conception
of
life
vanished
.
*NL*
Her
senses
expanded
;
she
felt
that
there
was
no
one
whom
she
might
not
*NL*
get
to
like
,
that
social
barriers
were
irremovable
,
doubtless
,
but
not
*NL*
particularly
high
.
You
jump
over
them
just
as
you
jump
into
a
peasant
's
*NL*
olive-yard
in
the
Apennines
,
and
he
is
glad
to
see
you
.
She
returned
*NL*
with
new
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
did
Cecil
;
but
Italy
had
quickened
Cecil
,
not
to
tolerance
,
but
to
*NL*
irritation
.
He
saw
that
the
local
society
was
narrow
,
but
,
instead
*NL*
of
saying
,
``
Does
that
very
much
matter
?
''
he
rebelled
,
and
tried
to
*NL*
substitute
for
it
the
society
he
called
broad
.
He
did
not
realize
that
*NL*
Lucy
had
consecrated
her
environment
by
the
thousand
little
civilities
*NL*
that
create
a
tenderness
in
time
,
and
that
though
her
eyes
saw
its
*NL*
defects
,
her
heart
refused
to
despise
it
entirely
.
Nor
did
he
realize
*NL*
a
more
important
point
--
that
if
she
was
too
great
for
this
society
,
she
*NL*
was
too
great
for
all
society
,
and
had
reached
the
stage
where
personal
*NL*
intercourse
would
alone
satisfy
her
.
A
rebel
she
was
,
but
not
of
the
*NL*
kind
he
understood
--
a
rebel
who
desired
,
not
a
wider
dwelling-room
,
but
*NL*
equality
beside
the
man
she
loved
.
For
Italy
was
offering
her
the
most
*NL*
priceless
of
all
possessions
--
her
own
soul
.

--
an
ancient
and
most
honourable
game
,
which
consists
in
*NL*
striking
tennis-balls
high
into
the
air
,
so
that
they
fall
over
the
net
*NL*
and
immoderately
bounce
;
some
hit
Mrs.
Honeychurch
;
others
are
lost
.
The
*NL*
sentence
is
confused
,
but
the
better
illustrates
Lucy
's
state
of
mind
,
*NL*
for
she
was
trying
to
talk
to
Mr.
Beebe
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
has
been
such
a
nuisance
--
first
he
,
then
they
--
no
one
knowing
*NL*
what
they
wanted
,
and
everyone
so
tiresome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
really
are
coming
now
,
''
said
Mr.
Beebe
.
``
I
wrote
to
Miss
*NL*
Teresa
a
few
days
ago
--
she
was
wondering
how
often
the
butcher
called
,
*NL*
and
my
reply
of
once
a
month
must
have
impressed
her
favourably
.
They
*NL*
are
coming
.
I
heard
from
them
this
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
hate
those
Miss
Alans
!
''
Mrs.
Honeychurch
cried
.
``
Just
because
*NL*
they
're
old
and
silly
one
's
expected
to
say
`
How
sweet
!
'
I
hate
*NL*
their
`
if
'
-
ing
and
`
but
'
-
ing
and
`
and
'
-
ing
.
And
poor
Lucy
--
serve
her
*NL*
right
--
worn
to
a
shadow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
watched
the
shadow
springing
and
shouting
over
the
*NL*
tennis-court
.
Cecil
was
absent
--
one
did
not
play
bumble-puppy
when
he
*NL*
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
they
are
coming
--
No
,
Minnie
,
not
Saturn
.
''
Saturn
was
a
*NL*
tennis-ball
whose
skin
was
partially
unsewn
.
When
in
motion
his
orb
was
*NL*
encircled
by
a
ring
.
``
If
they
are
coming
,
Sir
Harry
will
let
them
move
*NL*
in
before
the
twenty-ninth
,
and
he
will
cross
out
the
clause
about
*NL*
whitewashing
the
ceilings
,
because
it
made
them
nervous
,
and
put
in
the
*NL*
fair
wear
and
tear
one
.
--
That
does
n't
count
.
I
told
you
not
Saturn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saturn
's
all
right
for
bumble-puppy
,
''
cried
Freddy
,
joining
them
.
*NL*
``
Minnie
,
do
n't
you
listen
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saturn
does
n't
bounce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saturn
bounces
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
does
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
;
he
bounces
better
than
the
Beautiful
White
Devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
look
at
Lucy
--
complaining
of
Saturn
,
and
all
the
time
's
got
the
*NL*
Beautiful
White
Devil
in
her
hand
,
ready
to
plug
it
in
.
That
's
right
,
*NL*
Minnie
,
go
for
her
--
get
her
over
the
shins
with
the
racquet
--
get
her
*NL*
over
the
shins
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
fell
,
the
Beautiful
White
Devil
rolled
from
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
picked
it
up
,
and
said
:
``
The
name
of
this
ball
is
Vittoria
*NL*
Corombona
,
please
.
''
But
his
correction
passed
unheeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Freddy
possessed
to
a
high
degree
the
power
of
lashing
little
girls
*NL*
to
fury
,
and
in
half
a
minute
he
had
transformed
Minnie
from
a
*NL*
well-mannered
child
into
a
howling
wilderness
.
Up
in
the
house
Cecil
*NL*
heard
them
,
and
,
though
he
was
full
of
entertaining
news
,
he
did
not
*NL*
come
down
to
impart
it
,
in
case
he
got
hurt
.
He
was
not
a
coward
and
*NL*
bore
necessary
pain
as
well
as
any
man
.
But
he
hated
the
physical
*NL*
violence
of
the
young
.
How
right
it
was
!
Sure
enough
it
ended
in
a
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
the
Miss
Alans
could
see
this
,
''
observed
Mr.
Beebe
,
just
as
*NL*
Lucy
,
who
was
nursing
the
injured
Minnie
,
was
in
turn
lifted
off
her
*NL*
feet
by
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
the
Miss
Alans
?
''
Freddy
panted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
taken
Cissie
Villa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
n't
the
name

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
his
foot
slipped
,
and
they
all
fell
most
agreeably
on
to
the
grass
.
*NL*
An
interval
elapses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
what
name
?
''
asked
Lucy
,
with
her
brother
's
head
in
her
lap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alan
was
n't
the
name

the
people

Harry
's

to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

Freddy
!
You
know
nothing
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
yourself

've
this
minute
seen
him

He
said
to
me
:

''
--
Freddy
was
an
indifferent
mimic
--
''
`
ahem

I
have
at
*NL*
last
procured
really
dee-sire-rebel
tenants

old
boy

*NL*
and
slapped
him
on
the
back

*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly

The
Miss

*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
not

More
like
Anderson

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

good
gracious

there
is
n't
going
to
be
another
muddle

Mrs.
*NL*
Honeychurch
exclaimed
.
``
Do
you
notice
,
Lucy

I
'm
always
right

I
said
*NL*

n't
interfere
with

Villa
.
I
'm
always

I
'm
quite
uneasy
at

being
always
right
so
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
another
muddle
of
Freddy
's
.
Freddy
does
n't
even
know
the
name
*NL*
of
the
people
he
pretends
have
taken
it
instead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do

I
've
got
it

Emerson

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emerson

I
'll
bet
you
anything
you
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
weathercock
Sir
Harry
is

''
said
Lucy
quietly
.
``
I
wish
I
had
*NL*
never
bothered
over
it
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
lay
on
her
back
and
gazed
at
the
cloudless
sky
.
Mr.
Beebe
,
*NL*
whose
opinion
of
her
rose
daily
,
whispered
to
his
niece
that
THAT
was
*NL*
the
proper
way
to
behave
if
any
little
thing
went
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
name
of
the
new
tenants
had
diverted
Mrs.
Honeychurch
from
*NL*
the
contemplation
of
her
own
abilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emerson
,
Freddy
?
Do
you
know
what
Emersons
they
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
they
're
any
Emersons
,
''
retorted
Freddy
,
who
was
*NL*
democratic
.
Like
his
sister
and
like
most
young
people
,
he
was
naturally
*NL*
attracted
by
the
idea
of
equality
,
and
the
undeniable
fact
that
there
*NL*
are
different
kinds
of
Emersons
annoyed
him
beyond
measure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
they
are
the
right
sort
of
person
.
All
right
,
Lucy
''
--
she
was
*NL*
sitting
up
again
--
``
I
see
you
looking
down
your
nose
and
thinking
your
*NL*
mother
's
a
snob
.
But
there
is
a
right
sort
and
a
wrong
sort
,
and
it
's
*NL*
affectation
to
pretend
there
is
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emerson
's
a
common
enough
name
,
''
Lucy
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
gazing
sideways
.
Seated
on
a
promontory
herself
,
she
could
see
*NL*
the
pine-clad
promontories
descending
one
beyond
another
into
the
Weald
.
*NL*
The
further
one
descended
the
garden
,
the
more
glorious
was
this
lateral
*NL*
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
merely
going
to
remark
,
Freddy
,
that
I
trusted
they
were
no
*NL*
relations
of
Emerson
the
philosopher
,
a
most
trying
man
.
Pray
,
does
that
*NL*
satisfy
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
he
grumbled
.
``
And
you
will
be
satisfied
,
too
,
for
they
're
*NL*
friends
of
Cecil
;
so
''
--
elaborate
irony
--
``
you
and
the
other
country
*NL*
families
will
be
able
to
call
in
perfect
safety

*NL*
*NL*
``
CECIL
?
''
exclaimed
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
rude
,
dear

''
said
his
mother
placidly
.
``
Lucy
,
do
n't
screech

*NL*
It
's
a
new
bad
habit
you
're
getting
into

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

Cecil
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friends
of
Cecil
's
,
''
he
repeated
,
''
`
and
so
really
dee-sire-rebel
.
Ahem
!
*NL*
Honeychurch
,
I
have
just
telegraphed
to
them
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
up
from
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
hard
on
Lucy
.
Mr.
Beebe
sympathized
with
her
very
much
.
While
she
*NL*
believed
that
her
snub
about
the
Miss
Alans
came
from
Sir
Harry
Otway
,
*NL*
she
had
borne
it
like
a
good
girl
.
She
might
well
``
screech
''
when
*NL*
she
heard
that
it
came
partly
from
her
lover
.
Mr.
Vyse
was
a
*NL*
tease
--
something
worse
than
a
tease
:
he
took
a
malicious
pleasure
*NL*
in
thwarting
people
.
The
clergyman
,
knowing
this
,
looked
at
Miss
*NL*
Honeychurch
with
more
than
his
usual
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
exclaimed
,
``
But
Cecil
's
Emersons
--
they
ca
n't
possibly
be
the
*NL*
same
ones
--
there
is
that
--
''
he
did
not
consider
that
the
exclamation
*NL*
was
strange
,
but
saw
in
it
an
opportunity
of
diverting
the
conversation
*NL*
while
she
recovered
her
composure
.
He
diverted
it
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emersons
who
were
at
Florence
,
do
you
mean
?
No
,
I
do
n't
suppose
it
*NL*
will
prove
to
be
them
.
It
is
probably
a
long
cry
from
them
to
friends
*NL*
of
Mr.
Vyse
's
.
Oh
,
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
the
oddest
people
!
The
queerest
*NL*
people
!
For
our
part
we
liked
them
,
did
n't
we
?
''
He
appealed
to
Lucy
.
*NL*
``
There
was
a
great
scene
over
some
violets
.
They
picked
violets
and
*NL*
filled
all
the
vases
in
the
room
of
these
very
Miss
Alans
who
have
*NL*
failed
to
come
to
Cissie
Villa
.
Poor
little
ladies
!
So
shocked
and
so
*NL*
pleased
.
It
used
to
be
one
of
Miss
Catharine
's
great
stories
.
`
My
dear
*NL*
sister
loves
flowers
,
'
it
began
.
They
found
the
whole
room
a
mass
of
*NL*
blue
--
vases
and
jugs
--
and
the
story
ends
with
`
So
ungentlemanly
and
yet
*NL*
so
beautiful
.
'
It
is
all
very
difficult
.
Yes
,
I
always
connect
those
*NL*
Florentine
Emersons
with
violets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fiasco
's
done
you
this
time
,
''
remarked
Freddy
,
not
seeing
that
his
*NL*
sister
's
face
was
very
red
.
She
could
not
recover
herself
.
Mr.
Beebe
saw
*NL*
it
,
and
continued
to
divert
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
particular
Emersons
consisted
of
a
father
and
a
son

the
son
*NL*
a
goodly
,
if
not
a
good
young
man
;
not
a
fool
,
I
fancy
,
but
very
*NL*
immature
--
pessimism
,
et
cetera
.
Our
special
joy
was
the
father
--
such
a
*NL*
sentimental
darling
,
and
people
declared
he
had
murdered
his
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
normal
state
Mr.
Beebe
would
never
have
repeated
such
gossip
,
*NL*
but
he
was
trying
to
shelter
Lucy
in
her
little
trouble
.
He
repeated
any
*NL*
rubbish
that
came
into
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Murdered
his
wife
?
''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
.
``
Lucy
,
do
n't
desert
us
--
go
*NL*
on
playing
bumble-puppy
.
Really
,
the
Pension
Bertolini
must
have
been
*NL*
the
oddest
place
.
That
's
the
second
murderer
I
've
heard
of
as
being
*NL*
there
.
Whatever
was
Charlotte
doing
to
stop
?
By-the-by
,
we
really
must
*NL*
ask
Charlotte
here
some
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
could
recall
no
second
murderer
.
He
suggested
that
his
hostess
*NL*
was
mistaken
.
At
the
hint
of
opposition
she
warmed
.
She
was
perfectly
*NL*
sure
that
there
had
been
a
second
tourist
of
whom
the
same
story
had
*NL*
been
told
.
The
name
escaped
her
.
What
was
the
name
?
Oh
,
what
was
the
*NL*
name
?
She
clasped
her
knees
for
the
name
.
Something
in
Thackeray
.
She
*NL*
struck
her
matronly
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
asked
her
brother
whether
Cecil
was
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
go
!
''
he
cried
,
and
tried
to
catch
her
by
the
ankles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
,
''
she
said
gravely
.
``
Do
n't
be
silly
.
You
always
overdo
it
*NL*
when
you
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
left
them
her
mother
's
shout
of
``
Harris
!
''
shivered
the
tranquil
*NL*
air
,
and
reminded
her
that
she
had
told
a
lie
and
had
never
put
it
*NL*
right
.
Such
a
senseless
lie
,
too
,
yet
it
shattered
her
nerves
and
*NL*
made
her
connect
these
Emersons
,
friends
of
Cecil
's
,
with
a
pair
of
*NL*
nondescript
tourists
.
Hitherto
truth
had
come
to
her
naturally
.
She
*NL*
saw
that
for
the
future
she
must
be
more
vigilant
,
and
be
--
absolutely
*NL*
truthful
?
Well
,
at
all
events
,
she
must
not
tell
lies
.
She
hurried
up
*NL*
the
garden
,
still
flushed
with
shame
.
A
word
from
Cecil
would
soothe
*NL*
her
,
she
was
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cecil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
!
''
he
called
,
and
leant
out
of
the
smoking-room
window
.
He
*NL*
seemed
in
high
spirits
.
``
I
was
hoping
you
'd
come

I
heard
you
all
*NL*
bear-gardening
,
but
there
's
better
fun
up
here
.
I
,
even
I
,
have
won
a
*NL*
great
victory
for
the
Comic
Muse
.
George
Meredith
's
right
--
the
cause
of
*NL*
Comedy
and
the
cause
of
Truth
are
really
the
same
;
and
I
,
even
I

have
*NL*
found
tenants
for
the
distressful
Cissie
Villa

it
all

*NL*
He
looked
very
attractive
when
his
face
was
bright
,
and
he
dispelled
her
*NL*
ridiculous
forebodings
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard

''
she
said
.
``
Freddy
has
told
us

Naughty
Cecil
!
I
suppose

I
must
forgive
you

Just
think
of
all
the
trouble
I
took
for
nothing
!
*NL*
Certainly
the
Miss
Alans
are
a
little
tiresome
,
and
I
'd
rather
have
nice
*NL*
friends
of
yours

But
you
ought
n't
to
tease
one
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Friends

he
laughed
.
``
But
,
Lucy
,
the
whole
joke
is
to
come
!
*NL*
Come
here

''
But
she
remained
standing
where
she
was
.
``
Do
you
know
where
*NL*
I
met
these
desirable
tenants

In
the
National
Gallery
,
when
I
was
up
to
*NL*
see
my
mother
last
week

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
odd
place
to
meet
people

she
said
nervously
.
``
I
do
n't
quite
*NL*
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
Umbrian
Room

Absolute
strangers

They
were
admiring
Luca
*NL*
Signorelli
--
of
course
,
quite
stupidly
.
However
,
we
got
talking
,
and
they
*NL*
refreshed
me
not
a
little
.
They
had
been
to
Italy

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Cecil

''
proceeded
hilariously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
course
of
conversation
they
said
that
they
wanted
a
country

cottage

the
father
to
live
there

the
son
to
run
down
for
week-ends
.
*NL*
I
thought
,
`
What
a
chance
of
scoring
off
Sir
Harry
!
'
and
I
took
*NL*
their
address
and
a
London
reference
,
found
they
were
n't
actual
*NL*
blackguards
--
it
was
great
sport

wrote
to
him

making
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Cecil
!
No

it
's
not
fair

I
've
probably
met
them
before

*NL*
*NL*
He
bore
her
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
fair

Anything
is
fair
that
punishes
a

That
old

Sir

is
too
disgusting

with
his
`

I
meant
to
read
him
a
lesson
some
time

*NL*
No
,
Lucy
,
the
classes
ought
to
mix
,
and
before
long
you
'll
agree
with
*NL*
me

There
ought
to
be
intermarriage

all

*NL*
*NL*
``

she
snapped
.
``
You
do

know
what
the

*NL*
*NL*
He
stared
at
her
,
and
felt
again
that
she
had
failed
to
be
Leonardesque
.
*NL*
``
No
,
you
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
was
inartistic

that
of
a
peevish
virago

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

fair

*NL*
had
no
business
to
undo
my
work
about
the
Miss
Alans
,
and
make
me
look
*NL*
ridiculous
.
You
call
it
scoring
off
Sir
Harry
,
but
do
you
realize
that
*NL*
it
is
all
at
my
expense
?
I
consider
it
most
disloyal
of
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Temper
!
''
he
thought
,
raising
his
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
it
was
worse
than
temper
--
snobbishness
.
As
long
as
Lucy
thought
*NL*
that
his
own
smart
friends
were
supplanting
the
Miss
Alans
,
she
had
*NL*
not
minded
.
He
perceived
that
these
new
tenants
might
be
of
value
*NL*
educationally
.
He
would
tolerate
the
father
and
draw
out
the
son
,
who
*NL*
was
silent
.
In
the
interests
of
the
Comic

he

*NL*
Chapter
XI
:
In
Mrs.
Vyse
's
Well-Appointed
Flat
*NL*
*NL*
The
Comic
Muse
,
though
able
to
look
after
her
own
interests
,
did
not
*NL*
disdain
the
assistance
of
Mr.
Vyse
.
His
idea
of
bringing
the
Emersons
to
*NL*
Windy
Corner
struck
her
as
decidedly
good
,
and
she
carried
through
the
*NL*
negotiations
without
a
hitch
.
Sir
Harry
Otway
signed
the
agreement
,
*NL*
met
Mr.
Emerson
,
who
was
duly
disillusioned
.
The
Miss
Alans
were
*NL*
duly
offended
,
and
wrote
a
dignified
letter
to
Lucy
,
whom
they
held
*NL*
responsible
for
the
failure
.
Mr.
Beebe
planned
pleasant
moments
for
the
*NL*
new-comers
,
and
told
Mrs.
Honeychurch
that
Freddy
must
call
on
them
as
*NL*
soon
as
they
arrived
.
Indeed
,
so
ample
was
the
Muse
's
equipment
that
she
*NL*
permitted
Mr.
Harris
,
never
a
very
robust
criminal
,
to
droop
his
head
,
*NL*
to
be
forgotten
,
and
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
--
to
descend
from
bright
heaven
to
earth
,
whereon
there
are
shadows
*NL*
because
there
are
hills
--
Lucy
was
at
first
plunged
into
despair
,
but
*NL*
settled
after
a
little
thought
that
it
did
not
matter
the
very
least
.
*NL*
Now
that
she
was
engaged
,
the
Emersons
would
scarcely
insult
her
and
*NL*
were
welcome
into
the
neighbourhood
.
And
Cecil
was
welcome
to
bring
whom
*NL*
he
would
into
the
neighbourhood
.
Therefore
Cecil
was
welcome
to
bring
*NL*
the
Emersons
into
the
neighbourhood
.
But
,
as
I
say
,
this
took
a
little
*NL*
thinking
,
and
--
so
illogical
are
girls
--
the
event
remained
rather
greater
*NL*
and
rather
more
dreadful
than
it
should
have
done
.
She
was
glad
that
*NL*
a
visit
to
Mrs.
Vyse
now
fell
due
;
the
tenants
moved
into
Cissie
Villa
*NL*
while
she
was
safe
in
the
London
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cecil
--
Cecil
darling
,
''
she
whispered
the
evening
she
arrived
,
and
crept
*NL*
into
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
,
too
,
became
demonstrative
.
He
saw
that
the
needful
fire
had
been
*NL*
kindled
in
Lucy
.
At
last
she
longed
for
attention
,
as
a
woman
should
,
*NL*
and
looked
up
to
him
because
he
was
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
do
love
me
,
little
thing
?
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Cecil
,
I
do
,
I
do
!
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
do
without
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
days
passed
.
Then
she
had
a
letter
from
Miss
Bartlett
.
A
*NL*
coolness
had
sprung
up
between
the
two
cousins
,
and
they
had
not
*NL*
corresponded
since
they
parted
in
August
.
The
coolness
dated
from
what
*NL*
Charlotte
would
call
``
the
flight
to
Rome
,
''
and
in
Rome
it
had
increased
*NL*
amazingly
.
For
the
companion
who
is
merely
uncongenial
in
the
mediaeval
*NL*
world
becomes
exasperating
in
the
classical
.
Charlotte
,
unselfish
in
the
*NL*
Forum
,
would
have
tried
a
sweeter
temper
than
Lucy
's
,
and
once
,
in
the
*NL*
Baths
of
Caracalla
,
they
had
doubted
whether
they
could
continue
*NL*
their
tour
.
Lucy
had
said
she
would
join
the
Vyses
--
Mrs.
Vyse
was
an
*NL*
acquaintance
of
her
mother
,
so
there
was
no
impropriety
in
the
plan
and
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
had
replied
that
she
was
quite
used
to
being
abandoned
*NL*
suddenly
.
Finally
nothing
happened
;
but
the
coolness
remained
,
and
,
for
*NL*
Lucy
,
was
even
increased
when
she
opened
the
letter
and
read
as
follows
.
*NL*
It
had
been
forwarded
from
Windy
Corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tunbridge
Wells

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
have
news
of
you
at
last
!
Miss
Lavish
has
been
bicycling
in
your
*NL*
parts
,
but
was
not
sure
whether
a
call
would
be
welcome
.
Puncturing
*NL*
her
tire
near
Summer
Street
,
and
it
being
mended
while
she
sat
very
*NL*
woebegone
in
that
pretty
churchyard
,
she
saw
to
her
astonishment
,
a
door
*NL*
open
opposite
and
the
younger
Emerson
man
come
out
.
He
said
his
father
*NL*
had
just
taken
the
house
.
He
SAID
he
did
not
know
that
you
lived
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
-LRB-
?
-RRB-
.
He
never
suggested
giving
Eleanor
a
cup
of
tea
.
Dear
*NL*
Lucy
,
I
am
much
worried
,
and
I
advise
you
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
his
*NL*
past
behaviour
to
your
mother
,
Freddy
,
and
Mr.
Vyse
,
who
will
forbid
him
*NL*
to
enter
the
house
,
etc.
.
That
was
a
great
misfortune
,
and
I
dare
say
you
*NL*
have
told
them
already
.
Mr.
Vyse
is
so
sensitive
.
I
remember
how
I
used
*NL*
to
get
on
his
nerves
at
Rome
.
I
am
very
sorry
about
it
all
,
and
should
*NL*
not
feel
easy
unless
I
warned
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
anxious
and
loving
cousin
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charlotte

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
much
annoyed
,
and
replied
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beauchamp
Mansions
,
S.W.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Charlotte
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
thanks
for
your
warning
.
When
Mr.
Emerson
forgot
himself
on
the
*NL*
mountain
,
you
made
me
promise
not
to
tell
mother
,
because
you
said
she
*NL*
would
blame
you
for
not
being
always
with
me
.
I
have
kept
that
promise
,
*NL*
and
can
not
possibly
tell
her
now
.
I
have
said
both
to
her
and
Cecil
*NL*
that
I
met
the
Emersons
at
Florence
,
and
that
they
are
respectable
*NL*
people
--
which
I
do
think
--
and
the
reason
that
he
offered
Miss
Lavish
no
*NL*
tea
was
probably
that
he
had
none
himself
.
She
should
have
tried
at
the
*NL*
Rectory
.
I
can
not
begin
making
a
fuss
at
this
stage
.
You
must
see
that
*NL*
it
would
be
too
absurd
.
If
the
Emersons
heard
I
had
complained
of
them
,
*NL*
they
would
think
themselves
of
importance
,
which
is
exactly
what
they
*NL*
are
not
.
I
like
the
old
father
,
and
look
forward
to
seeing
him
again
.
*NL*
As
for
the
son
,
I
am
sorry
for
him
when
we
meet
,
rather
than
for
myself
.
*NL*
They
are
known
to
Cecil
,
who
is
very
well
and
spoke
of
you
the
other
*NL*
day
.
We
expect
to
be
married
in
January
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Lavish
can
not
have
told
you
much
about

I
am
not

Corner

all
,
but
here
.
Please
do
not
put
`

outside
your

*NL*
*NL*
Secrecy
has
this
disadvantage
:
we
lose
the
sense
of
proportion
;
we
*NL*
can
not
tell
whether
our
secret
is
important
or
not
.
Were
Lucy
and
her
*NL*
cousin
closeted
with
a
great
thing
which
would
destroy
Cecil
's
life
if
*NL*
he
discovered
it
,
or
with
a
little
thing
which
he
would
laugh
at
?
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
suggested
the
former
.
Perhaps
she
was
right
.
It
had
become
a
*NL*
great
thing
now
.
Left
to
herself
,
Lucy
would
have
told
her
mother
*NL*
and
her
lover
ingenuously
,
and
it
would
have
remained
a
little
thing
.
*NL*
``
Emerson
,
not
Harris
''
;
it
was
only
that
a
few
weeks
ago
.
She
tried
to
*NL*
tell
Cecil
even
now
when
they
were
laughing
about
some
beautiful
*NL*
lady
who
had
smitten
his
heart
at
school
.
But
her
body
behaved
so
*NL*
ridiculously
that
she
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
and
her
secret
stayed
ten
days
longer
in
the
deserted
Metropolis
*NL*
visiting
the
scenes
they
were
to
know
so
well
later
on
.
It
did
her
no
*NL*
harm
,
Cecil
thought
,
to
learn
the
framework
of
society
,
while
society
*NL*
itself
was
absent
on
the
golf-links
or
the
moors
.
The
weather
was
cool
,
*NL*
and
it
did
her
no
harm
.
In
spite
of
the
season
,
Mrs.
Vyse
managed
to
*NL*
scrape
together
a
dinner-party
consisting
entirely
of
the
grandchildren
*NL*
of
famous
people
.
The
food
was
poor
,
but
the
talk
had
a
witty
weariness
*NL*
that
impressed
the
girl
.
One
was
tired
of
everything
,
it
seemed
.
One
*NL*
launched
into
enthusiasms
only
to
collapse
gracefully
,
and
pick
oneself
*NL*
up
amid
sympathetic
laughter
.
In
this
atmosphere
the
Pension
Bertolini
*NL*
and
Windy
Corner
appeared
equally
crude
,
and
Lucy
saw
that
her
London
*NL*
career
would
estrange
her
a
little
from
all
that
she
had
loved
in
the
*NL*
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grandchildren
asked
her
to
play
the
piano
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
played
Schumann
.
``
Now
some
Beethoven
''
called
Cecil
,
when
the
*NL*
querulous
beauty
of
the
music
had
died
.
She
shook
her
head
and
played
*NL*
Schumann
again
.
The
melody
rose
,
unprofitably
magical
.
It
broke
;
it
*NL*
was
resumed
broken
,
not
marching
once
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
.
The
*NL*
sadness
of
the
incomplete
--
the
sadness
that
is
often
Life
,
but
should
*NL*
never
be
Art
--
throbbed
in
its
disjected
phrases
,
and
made
the
nerves
of
*NL*
the
audience
throb
.
Not
thus
had
she
played
on
the
little
draped
piano
*NL*
at
the
Bertolini
,
and
``
Too
much
Schumann
''
was
not
the
remark
that
Mr.
*NL*
Beebe
had
passed
to
himself
when
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
guests
were
gone
,
and
Lucy
had
gone
to
bed
,
Mrs.
Vyse
paced
*NL*
up
and
down
the
drawing-room
,
discussing
her
little
party
with
her
son
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Vyse
was
a
nice
woman
,
but
her
personality
,
like
many
another
's
,
*NL*
had
been
swamped
by
London
,
for
it
needs
a
strong
head
to
live
among
*NL*
many
people
.
The
too
vast
orb
of
her
fate
had
crushed
her
;
and
she
had
*NL*
seen
too
many
seasons
,
too
many
cities
,
too
many
men
,
for
her
abilities
,
*NL*
and
even
with
Cecil
she
was
mechanical
,
and
behaved
as
if
he
was
not
one
*NL*
son
,
but
,
so
to
speak
,
a
filial
crowd
.

straining

He
broke
off

remembering

had

concluded

As
she
was
dozing
off
,
a
cry
--
the
cry
of
nightmare
--
rang
from
Lucy
's
*NL*
room
.
Lucy
could
ring
for
the
maid
if
she
liked
but
Mrs.
Vyse
thought
it
*NL*
kind
to
go
herself

She
found
the
girl
sitting
upright
with
her
hand
on

her
cheek

*NL*
*NL*
``

The

smiled
and
kissed
her
,
saying
very
distinctly
:

Twelfth
Chapter
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
Saturday
afternoon
,
gay
and
brilliant
after
abundant
rains
,
and
*NL*
the
spirit
of
youth
dwelt
in
it
,
though
the
season
was
now
autumn
.
All
*NL*
that
was
gracious
triumphed
.
As
the
motorcars
passed
through
Summer
*NL*
Street
they
raised
only
a
little
dust
,
and
their
stench
was
soon
*NL*
dispersed
by
the
wind
and
replaced
by
the
scent
of
the
wet
birches
or
*NL*
of
the
pines
.
Mr.
Beebe
,
at
leisure
for
life
's
amenities
,
leant
over
his
*NL*
Rectory
gate
.
Freddy
leant
by
him
,
smoking
a
pendant
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Freddy
,
whom
his
fellow-creatures
never
amused
,
suggested
that
the
new
*NL*
people
might
be
feeling
a
bit
busy
,
and
so
on
,
since
they
had
only
just
*NL*
moved
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suggested
we
should
hinder
them

''
said
Mr.
Beebe
.
``
They
are

''
Unlatching
the
gate
,
he
sauntered
over
the
triangular
green
to
*NL*
Cissie
Villa
.
``
Hullo
!
''
he
cried
,
shouting
in
at
the
open
door
,
through
*NL*
which
much
squalor
was
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
grave
voice
replied
,
``
Hullo

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
brought
someone

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll

*NL*
The
passage
was
blocked
by
a
wardrobe
,
which
the
removal
men
had
failed
*NL*
to
carry
up
the
stairs
.
Mr.
Beebe
edged
round
it
with
difficulty
.
The
*NL*
sitting-room
itself
was
blocked
with
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
these

great

Freddy
whispered
.
``
Are

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

look

said
Freddy
in
awestruck
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
cornice
of
the
wardrobe
,
the
hand
of
an
amateur
had
painted
this
*NL*
inscription
:
``
Mistrust
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

``

*NL*
*NL*
``

But
Freddy
was
his

son
and
felt
that
one
ought
not
to
go
on
*NL*
spoiling
the
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

the
clergyman
continued
,
scrambling
about

George
ran
down-stairs

pushed
them
into
the
room
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

introduce

*NL*
Then
Freddy
hurled
one
of
the
thunderbolts
of
youth
.
Perhaps
he
was
shy
,
*NL*
perhaps
he
was
friendly
,
or
perhaps
he
thought
that
George
's
face
wanted
*NL*
washing

At
all
events
he
greeted
him
with
,
``

led
the
way
out

of

into
the
pine-woods

For
a
little

time
the
voice

pursued

dispensing
good

philosophy

It
ceased

they
only
heard
the
fair
wind
blowing
the

bracken
and
the
trees

Mr.
Beebe
,
who
could
be
silent
,
but
who
could
not

bear
silence

was
compelled
to
chatter

since
the
expedition
looked
like

a
failure

and
neither

utter
a

spoke

attended
gravely

assenting

dissenting
with
slight

but
determined
gestures

inexplicable

tree-tops

ten

cross-question

first
meet

``
Looking

seek
out
things
Italian

so
do
we

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is

persisted
George
.
``
But

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
slid
away
from
such
heavy
treatment
of
the
subject
.
But
he
was
*NL*
infinitely
tolerant
of
the
young

and
had
no
desire
to
snub
George

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wishing
to
round
off
the
episode
,
he
added
;
``
We
are
all
so
glad
that
you
*NL*
have
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
are
!
''
called
Freddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
good
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Beebe
,
mopping
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
there
's
the
pond
.
I
wish
it
was
bigger
,
''
he
added
apologetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
climbed
down
a
slippery
bank
of
pine-needles
.
There
lay
the
pond
,
*NL*
set
in
its
little
alp
of
green
--
only
a
pond
,
but
large
enough
to
contain
*NL*
the
human
body
,
and
pure
enough
to
reflect
the
sky
.
On
account
of
the
*NL*
rains
,
the
waters
had
flooded
the
surrounding
grass
,
which
showed
like
a
*NL*
beautiful
emerald
path
,
tempting
these
feet
towards
the
central
pool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
distinctly
successful
,
as

said
Mr.

.
``
No

necessary

*NL*
*NL*
George
sat
down
where
the
ground
was
dry
,
and
drearily
unlaced
his
*NL*
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
those

*NL*
No

knew

seemed
to
care

*NL*
``

this

all
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

called
Freddy
,
as
he
stripped
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

thought
he
was
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Water
's
wonderful
!
''
cried
Freddy
,
prancing
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Water
's
water
,
''
murmured
George
.
Wetting
his
hair
first
--
a
sure
sign
of
*NL*
apathy
--
he
followed
Freddy
into
the
divine
,
as
indifferent
as
if
he
were
*NL*
a
statue
and
the
pond
a
pail
of
soapsuds
.
It
was
necessary
to
use
his
*NL*
muscles
.
It
was
necessary
to
keep
clean
.
Mr.
Beebe
watched
them
,
and
*NL*
watched
the
seeds
of
the
willow-herb
dance
chorically
above
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apooshoo
,
apooshoo
,
apooshoo
,
''
went
Freddy
,
swimming
for
two
strokes
in
*NL*
either
direction
,
and
then
becoming
involved
in
reeds
or
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
worth
it
?
''
asked
the
other
,
Michelangelesque
on
the
flooded
*NL*
margin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bank
broke
away
,
and
he
fell
into
the
pool
before
he
had
weighed
the
*NL*
question
properly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hee-poof
--
I
've
swallowed
a
pollywog

Mr.

*NL*
water
's
simply
ripping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Water
's
not
so
bad
,
''
said
George
,
reappearing
from
his
plunge
,
and
*NL*
sputtering
at
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Water
's
wonderful

Mr.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apooshoo

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
,
who
was
hot
,
and
who
always
acquiesced
where
possible
,
looked
*NL*
around
him
.
He
could
detect
no
parishioners
except
the
pine-trees
,
*NL*
rising
up
steeply
on
all
sides
,
and
gesturing
to
each
other
against
*NL*
the
blue
.
How
glorious
it
was
!
The
world
of
motor-cars
and
rural
Deans
*NL*
receded
inimitably
.
Water
,
sky
,
evergreens
,
a
wind
--
these
things
not
*NL*
even
the
seasons
can
touch
,
and
surely
they
lie
beyond
the
intrusion
of
*NL*
man
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
as
well
wash
too
''
;
and
soon
his
garments
made
a
third
little
pile
*NL*
on
the
sward
,
and
he
too
asserted
the
wonder
of
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
ordinary
water
,
nor
was
there
very
much
of
it
,
and
,
as
Freddy
*NL*
said
,
it
reminded
one
of
swimming
in
a
salad
.
The
three
gentlemen
*NL*
rotated
in
the
pool
breast
high
,
after
the
fashion
of
the
nymphs
in
*NL*
Gotterdammerung
.
But
either
because
the
rains
had
given
a
freshness
or
*NL*
because
the
sun
was
shedding
a
most
glorious
heat
,
or
because
two
of
the
*NL*
gentlemen
were
young
in
years
and
the
third
young
in
spirit
--
for
some
*NL*
reason
or
other
a
change
came
over
them
,
and
they
forgot
Italy
and
*NL*
Botany
and
Fate
.
They
began
to
play
.
Mr.
Beebe
and
Freddy
splashed
each
*NL*
other
.
A
little
deferentially
,
they
splashed
George
.
He
was
quiet
:
they
*NL*
feared
they
had
offended
him
.
Then
all
the
forces
of
youth
burst
out
.
He
*NL*
smiled
,
flung
himself
at
them
,
splashed
them
,
ducked
them
,
kicked
them
,
*NL*
muddied
them
,
and
drove
them
out
of
the
pool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Race
you
round
it
,
then
,
''
cried
Freddy
,
and
they
raced
in
the
sunshine
,
*NL*
and
George
took
a
short
cut
and
dirtied
his
shins
,
and
had
to
bathe
a
*NL*
second
time
.
Then
Mr.
Beebe
consented
to
run
--
a
memorable
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
ran
to
get
dry
,
they
bathed
to
get
cool
,
they
played
at
being
*NL*
Indians
in
the
willow-herbs
and
in
the
bracken
,
they
bathed
to
get
*NL*
clean
.
And
all
the
time
three
little
bundles
lay
discreetly
on
the
*NL*
sward
,
proclaiming
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
We
are
what
matters
.
Without
us
shall
no
enterprise
begin
.
To
us
*NL*
shall
all
flesh
turn
in
the
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
try
!
A
try
!
''
yelled
Freddy
,
snatching
up
George
's
bundle
and
placing
*NL*
it
beside
an
imaginary
goal-post
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Socker
rules
,
''
George
retorted
,
scattering
Freddy
's
bundle
with
a
kick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pass

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care

cried
Mr.
Beebe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clothes
flew
in
all
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
my
hat
!
No
,
that
's
enough

Freddy
.
Dress
now
.
No
,
I
say

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
two
young
men
were
delirious
.
Away
they
twinkled
into
the
trees
,
*NL*
Freddy
with
a
clerical
waistcoat
under
his
arm
,
George
with
a
wide-awake
*NL*
hat
on
his
dripping
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
'll
do
!
''
shouted
Mr.
Beebe
,
remembering
that
after
all
he
was
in
*NL*
his
own
parish
.
Then
his
voice
changed
as
if
every
pine-tree
was
a
Rural
*NL*
Dean
.
``
Hi
!
Steady
on
!
I
see
people
coming
you
fellows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yells
,
and
widening
circles
over
the
dappled
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi
!
hi
!
LADIES
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
George
nor
Freddy
was
truly
refined
.
Still
,
they
did
not
hear
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
's
last
warning
or
they
would
have
avoided
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
*NL*
Cecil
,
and
Lucy
,
who
were
walking
down
to
call
on
old
Mrs.
Butterworth
.
*NL*
Freddy
dropped
the
waistcoat
at
their
feet
,
and
dashed
into
some
*NL*
bracken
.
George
whooped
in
their
faces
,
turned
and
scudded
away
down
the
*NL*
path
to
the
pond
,
still
clad
in
Mr.
Beebe
's
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
alive
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Honeychurch
.
``
Whoever
were
those
*NL*
unfortunate
people
?
Oh
,
dears
,
look
away

And
poor
Mr.

!
*NL*
Whatever
has
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
this
way
immediately

''
commanded
Cecil
,
who
always
felt
that
he
*NL*
must
lead
women
,
though
he
knew
not
whither
,
and
protect
them
,
though
he
*NL*
knew
not
against
what
.
He
led
them
now
towards
the
bracken
where
Freddy
*NL*
sat
concealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
poor
Mr.
Beebe
!
Was
that
his
waistcoat
we
left
in
the
path

Cecil
,
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
's
waistcoat
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
business
of
ours

said
Cecil
,
glancing
at
Lucy
,
who
was
all
parasol
*NL*
and
evidently
`
minded
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
Mr.
Beebe
jumped
back
into
the
pond

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way

Mrs.
Honeychurch

this
way

*NL*
*NL*
They
followed
him
up
the
bank
attempting
the
tense
yet
nonchalant
*NL*
expression
that
is
suitable
for
ladies
on
such
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
ca
n't
help
it

said
a
voice
close
ahead
,
and
Freddy
reared
a
*NL*
freckled
face
and
a
pair
of
snowy
shoulders
out
of
the
fronds
.
``
I
ca
n't

trodden
on

*NL*
*NL*
``

They
turned
.
``
Oh

do

Oh

poor

How
unfortunate
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
For
Mr.
Beebe
was
just
crawling
out
of
the
pond
,
on
whose
surface
*NL*
garments
of
an
intimate
nature
did
float
;
while
George
,
the
world-weary
*NL*
George
,
shouted
to
Freddy
that
he
had
hooked
a
fish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
me
,
I
've
swallowed
one

answered
he
of
the
bracken
.
``

``

said
Mrs.

who
found
it
impossible
to
remain

shocked

``

``

Lucy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo

''
cried
George
,
so
that
again
the
ladies
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
regarded
himself
as
dressed
.
Barefoot
,
bare-chested
,
radiant
and
*NL*
personable
against
the
shadowy
woods
,
he
called
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Honeychurch
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
and
all
that
night
the
water
ran
away
.
On
the
morrow
the
*NL*
pool
had
shrunk
to
its
old
size
and
lost
its
glory
.
It
had
been
a
*NL*
call
to
the
blood
and
to
the
relaxed
will
,
a
passing
benediction
whose
*NL*
influence
did
not
pass
,
a
holiness
,
a
spell
,
a
momentary
chalice
for
*NL*

Chapter
XIII
:
How
Miss
Bartlett
's
Boiler
Was
So
Tiresome
*NL*
*NL*
How
often
had
Lucy
rehearsed
this
bow
,
this
interview
!
But
she
had
*NL*
always
rehearsed
them
indoors
,
and
with
certain
accessories
,
which
*NL*
surely
we
have
a
right
to
assume
.
Who
could
foretell
that
she
and
George
*NL*
would
meet
in
the
rout
of
a
civilization
,
amidst
an
army
of
coats
*NL*
and
collars
and
boots
that
lay
wounded
over
the
sunlit
earth
?
She
had
*NL*
imagined
a
young
Mr.
Emerson
,
who
might
be
shy
or
morbid
or
indifferent
*NL*
or
furtively
impudent
.
She
was
prepared
for
all
of
these
.
But
she
had
*NL*
never
imagined
one
who
would
be
happy
and
greet
her
with
the
shout
of
*NL*
the
morning
star
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indoors
herself
,
partaking
of
tea
with
old
Mrs.
Butterworth
,
she
*NL*
reflected
that
it
is
impossible
to
foretell
the
future
with
any
degree
*NL*
of
accuracy
,
that
it
is
impossible
to
rehearse
life
.
A
fault
in
the
*NL*
scenery
,
a
face
in
the
audience
,
an
irruption
of
the
audience
on
to
the
*NL*
stage
,
and
all
our
carefully
planned
gestures
mean
nothing
,
or
mean
too
*NL*
much
.
``
I
will
bow
,
''
she
had
thought
.
``
I
will
not
shake
hands
with
him
.
*NL*
That
will
be
just
the
proper
thing
.
''
She
had
bowed
--
but
to
whom
?
To
*NL*
gods
,
to
heroes
,
to
the
nonsense
of
school-girls
!
She
had
bowed
across
*NL*
the
rubbish
that
cumbers
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
ran
her
thoughts
,
while
her
faculties
were
busy
with
Cecil
.
It
was
*NL*
another
of
those
dreadful
engagement
calls
.
Mrs.
Butterworth
had
wanted
*NL*
to
see
him
,
and
he
did
not
want
to
be
seen
.
He
did
not
want
to
hear
*NL*
about
hydrangeas
,
why
they
change
their
colour
at
the
seaside
.
He
did
*NL*
not
want
to
join
the
C.
O.
S
.
When
cross
he
was
always
elaborate
,
and
*NL*
made
long
,
clever
answers
where
``
Yes
''
or
``
No
''
would
have
done
.
Lucy
*NL*
soothed
him
and
tinkered
at
the
conversation
in
a
way
that
promised
well
*NL*
for
their
married
peace
.
No
one
is
perfect
,
and
surely
it
is
wiser
to
*NL*
discover
the
imperfections
before
wedlock
.
Miss
Bartlett
,
indeed
,
though
*NL*
not
in
word
,
had
taught
the
girl
that
this
our
life
contains
nothing
*NL*
satisfactory
.
Lucy
,
though
she
disliked
the
teacher
,
regarded
the
*NL*
teaching
as
profound
,
and
applied
it
to
her
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
,
''
said
her
mother
,
when
they
got
home
,
``
is
anything
the
matter
*NL*
with
Cecil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
was
ominous
;
up
till
now
Mrs.
Honeychurch
had
behaved
with
*NL*
charity
and
restraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
think
so
,
mother
;
Cecil
's
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
's
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
compromised
:
perhaps
Cecil
was
a
little
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
otherwise
''
--
she
pulled
out
her
bonnet-pins
with
gathering
*NL*
displeasure
--
``
because
otherwise
I
can
not
account
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
think
Mrs.
Butterworth
is
rather
tiresome
,
if
you
mean
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cecil
has
told
you
to
think
so
.
You
were
devoted
to
her
as
a
little
*NL*
girl
,
and
nothing
will
describe
her
goodness
to
you
through
the
typhoid
*NL*
fever
.
No
--
it
is
just
the
same
thing
everywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
just
put
your
bonnet
away
,
may
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
he
could
answer
her
civilly
for
one
half-hour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cecil
has
a
very
high
standard
for
people
,
''
faltered
Lucy
,
seeing
*NL*
trouble
ahead
.
``
It
's
part
of
his
ideals
--
it
is
really
that
that
makes
*NL*
him
sometimes
seem
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
rubbish
!
If
high
ideals
make
a
young
man
rude
,
the
sooner
he
gets
*NL*
rid
of
them
the
better
,
''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
handing
her
the
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
mother
!
I
've
seen
you
cross
with
Mrs.
Butterworth
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
that
way
.
At
times
I
could
wring
her
neck
.
But
not
in
that
way
.
*NL*
No
.
It
is
the
same
with
Cecil
all
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By-the-by
--
I
never
told
you
.
I
had
a
letter
from
Charlotte
while
I
was
*NL*
away
in
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
attempt
to
divert
the
conversation
was
too
puerile
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Honeychurch
resented
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
Cecil
came
back
from
London
,
nothing
appears
to
please
him
.
*NL*
Whenever
I
speak
he
winces
;
--
I
see
him
,
Lucy
;
it
is
useless
to
*NL*
contradict
me
.
No
doubt
I
am
neither
artistic
nor
literary
nor
*NL*
intellectual
nor
musical
,
but
I
can
not
help
the
drawing-room
furniture
;
*NL*
your
father
bought
it
and
we
must
put
up
with
it
,
will
Cecil
kindly
*NL*
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
see
what
you
mean
,
and
certainly
Cecil
ought
n't
to
.
But
he
does
*NL*
not
mean
to
be
uncivil
--
he
once
explained
--
it
is
the
things
that
upset
*NL*
him
--
he
is
easily
upset
by
ugly
things
--
he
is
not
uncivil
to
PEOPLE
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
thing
or
a
person
when
Freddy
sings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
expect
a
really
musical
person
to
enjoy
comic
songs
as
we
*NL*
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
n't
he
leave
the
room
?
Why
sit
wriggling
and
sneering
and
*NL*
spoiling
everyone
's
pleasure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
n't
be
unjust
to
people
,
''
faltered
Lucy
.
Something
had
enfeebled
*NL*
her
,
and
the
case
for
Cecil
,
which
she
had
mastered
so
perfectly
in
*NL*
London
,
would
not
come
forth
in
an
effective
form
.
The
two
civilizations
*NL*
had
clashed
--
Cecil
hinted
that
they
might
--
and
she
was
dazzled
and
*NL*
bewildered
,
as
though
the
radiance
that
lies
behind
all
civilization
*NL*
had
blinded
her
eyes
.
Good
taste
and
bad
taste
were
only
catchwords
,
*NL*
garments
of
diverse
cut
;
and
music
itself
dissolved
to
a
whisper
through
*NL*
pine-trees
,
where
the
song
is
not
distinguishable
from
the
comic
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
in
much
embarrassment
,
while
Mrs.
Honeychurch
changed
*NL*
her
frock
for
dinner
;
and
every
now
and
then
she
said
a
word
,
and
made
*NL*
things
no
better
.
There
was
no
concealing
the
fact
,
Cecil
had
meant
*NL*
to
be
supercilious
,
and
he
had
succeeded
.
And
Lucy
--
she
knew
not
*NL*
why
--
wished
that
the
trouble
could
have
come
at
any
other
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
dress
,
dear
;
you
'll
be
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
mother
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
`
All
right
'
and
stop
.
Go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
obeyed
,
but
loitered
disconsolately
at
the
landing
window
.
It
faced
*NL*
north
,
so
there
was
little
view
,
and
no
view
of
the
sky
.
Now
,
as
in
the
*NL*
winter
,
the
pine-trees
hung
close
to
her
eyes
.
One
connected
the
landing
*NL*
window
with
depression
.
No
definite
problem
menaced
her
,
but
she
sighed
*NL*
to
herself
,
``
Oh
,
dear
,
what
shall
I
do
,
what
shall
I
do
?
''
It
seemed
to
*NL*
her
that
everyone
else
was
behaving
very
badly
.
And
she
ought
not
to
*NL*
have
mentioned
Miss
Bartlett
's
letter
.
She
must
be
more
careful
;
her
*NL*
mother
was
rather
inquisitive
,
and
might
have
asked
what
it
was
about
.
*NL*
Oh
,
dear
,
what
should
she
do
?
--
and
then
Freddy
came
bounding
upstairs
,
and
*NL*
joined
the
ranks
of
the
ill-behaved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
those
are
topping
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
baby
,
how
tiresome
you

been

no

the
Sacred
Lake

it
's
much
too
public

It
was
all
right
for
*NL*
you
but
most
awkward
for
everyone
else
.
Do
be
more
careful

You
forget
*NL*
the
place
is
growing
half
suburban
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
is
anything
on
to-morrow
week
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
I
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
want
to
ask
the
Emersons
up
to
Sunday
tennis

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
would
n't
do
that

Freddy

that

muddle

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
wrong

the
court

They
wo
n't

a
bump

two

and
I

ordered
new
balls

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant

's
better

I
really
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
her
by
the
elbows
and
humorously
danced
her
up
and
down
the
*NL*
passage
.
She
pretended
not
to
mind
,
but
she
could
have
screamed
with
*NL*
temper
.
Cecil
glanced
at
them
as
he
proceeded
to
his
toilet
and
they
*NL*
impeded
Mary
with
her
brood
of
hot-water
cans
.
Then
Mrs.
Honeychurch
*NL*
opened
her
door
and
said
:
``
Lucy
,
what
a
noise
you
're
making
!
I
*NL*
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
Did
you
say
you
had
had
a
letter
from
*NL*
Charlotte
?
''
and
Freddy
ran
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
really
ca
n't
stop
.
I
must
dress
too

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
Charlotte
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unfortunate
girl
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
a
bad
habit
of
hurrying
away
in
the
middle
of
one
's
sentences

mention
her
boiler
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
WHAT
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
remember
that
her
boiler
was
to
be
had
out
in
October
,

*NL*
her
bath
cistern
cleaned
out
,
and
all
kinds
of
terrible
to-doings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
remember
all
Charlotte

worries

said
Lucy
bitterly
.
``
I
shall
*NL*
have
enough
of
my
own
,
now
that
you
are
not
pleased
with
Cecil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Honeychurch
might
have
flamed
out
.
She
did
not
.
She
said
:
``
Come
*NL*
here
,
old
lady
--
thank
you
for
putting
away
my
bonnet
--
kiss
me
.
''
And
,
*NL*
though
nothing
is
perfect
,
Lucy
felt
for
the
moment
that
her
mother
and
*NL*
Windy
Corner
and
the
Weald
in
the
declining
sun
were
perfect
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
grittiness
went
out
of
life
.
It
generally
did
at
Windy
Corner
.
*NL*
At
the
last
minute
,
when
the
social
machine
was
clogged
hopelessly
,
one
*NL*
member
or
other
of
the
family
poured
in
a
drop
of
oil
.
Cecil
despised
*NL*
their
methods
--
perhaps
rightly
.
At
all
events
,
they
were
not
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
was
at
half-past
seven
.
Freddy
gabbled
the
grace
,
and
they
drew
*NL*
up
their
heavy
chairs
and
fell
to
.
Fortunately
,
the
men
were
hungry
.
*NL*
Nothing
untoward
occurred
until
the
pudding
.
Then
Freddy
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
,
what
's
Emerson
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
him
in
Florence
,
''
said
Lucy
,
hoping
that
this
would
pass
for
a
*NL*
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
the
clever
sort
,
or
is
he
a
decent
chap
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
Cecil
;
it
is
Cecil
who
brought
him
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
the
clever
sort
,
like
myself
,
''
said
Cecil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Freddy
looked
at
him
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
well
did
you
know
them
at
the
Bertolini
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Honeychurch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
slightly
.
I
mean
,
Charlotte
knew
them
even
less
than
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
reminds
me
--
you
never
told
me
what
Charlotte
said
in
her
*NL*
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
and
another
,
''
said
Lucy
,
wondering
whether
she
would
get
*NL*
through
the
meal
without
a
lie
.
``
Among
other
things
,
that
an
awful
*NL*
friend
of
hers
had
been
bicycling
through
Summer
Street
,
wondered
if
*NL*
she
'd
come
up
and
see
us
,
and
mercifully
did
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
,
I
do
call
the
way
you
talk
unkind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
a
novelist
,
''
said
Lucy
craftily
.
The
remark
was
a
happy
one
,
*NL*
for
nothing
roused
Mrs.
Honeychurch
so
much
as
literature
in
the
hands
*NL*
of
females
.
She
would
abandon
every
topic
to
inveigh
against
those
women
*NL*
who
-LRB-
instead
of
minding
their
houses
and
their
children
-RRB-
seek
notoriety
*NL*
by
print
.
Her
attitude
was
:
``
If
books
must
be
written
,
let
them
be
*NL*
written
by
men
''
;
and
she
developed
it
at
great
length
,
while
Cecil
*NL*
yawned
and
Freddy
played
at
``
This
year
,
next
year
,
now
,
never
,
''
with
his
*NL*
plum-stones
,
and
Lucy
artfully
fed
the
flames
of
her
mother
's
wrath
.
But
*NL*
soon
the
conflagration
died
down
,
and
the
ghosts
began
to
gather
in
the
*NL*
darkness
.
There
were
too
many
ghosts
about
.
The
original
ghost
--
that
*NL*
touch
of
lips
on
her
cheek
--
had
surely
been
laid
long
ago
;
it
could
be
*NL*
nothing
to
her
that
a
man
had
kissed
her
on
a
mountain
once
.
But
it
*NL*
had
begotten
a
spectral
family
--
Mr.
Harris
,
Miss
Bartlett
's
letter
,
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
's
memories
of
violets
--
and
one
or
other
of
these
was
bound
to
*NL*
haunt
her
before
Cecil
's
very
eyes
.
It
was
Miss
Bartlett
who
returned
*NL*
now
,
and
with
appalling
vividness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
,
Lucy
,
of
that
letter
of
Charlotte
's

How
is
she
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tore
the
thing
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't

how
she
was

How
does
she
sound

Cheerful

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes
I
suppose
so

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

upon
it

boiler

I
know
myself
how
water
preys
*NL*
upon

's
mind

I
would
rather
anything
else

even
a
misfortune
with

the
meat

*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
laid
his
hand
over
his
eyes

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
would

asserted
Freddy
,
backing
his
mother
up

backing
up
the

spirit
of
her
remark
rather
than
the
substance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
been
thinking

she
added
rather
nervously
,
``
surely

could

squeeze
Charlotte
in
here
next
week

a
nice
holiday

at
Tunbridge
Wells
finish

not
seen
poor
Charlotte
for
*NL*
so
long

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
more
than
her
nerves
could
stand
.
And
she
could
not
protest
*NL*
violently
after
her
mother
's
goodness
to
her
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother

no

she
pleaded
.
``
It

impossible

again

laying
his

over

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

repeated
Lucy
.
``
I
do
n't
want

it
really

*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

Cecil

She
gets
on

have

seen
her
lately
,
and
do
n't
realize
how
tiresome
she
can
be
,
*NL*
though
so
good

So
please

do

worry
us
this
last

spoil
us
by
not
asking
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
,
hear
!
''
said
Cecil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
with
more
gravity
than
usual
,
and
with
more
feeling
*NL*
than
she
usually
permitted
herself
,
replied
:
``
This
is
n't
very
kind
of
*NL*
you
two
.
You
have
each
other
and
all
these
woods
to
walk
in
,
so
full
of
*NL*
beautiful
things
;
and
poor
Charlotte
has
only
the
water
turned
off
and
*NL*
plumbers
.
You
are
young

dears
,
and
however
clever
young
people
are

and
*NL*
however
many
books
they
read

they
will
never
guess
what
it
feels
like
*NL*
to
grow
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
crumbled
his
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
Cousin
Charlotte
was
very
kind
to
me
that
year
I
called
on
*NL*
my
bike
,
''
put
in
Freddy
.
``
She
thanked
me
for
coming
till
I
felt
like
*NL*
such
a
fool
,
and
fussed
round
no
end
to
get
an
egg
boiled
for
my
tea
*NL*
just
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
dear
.
She
is
kind
to
everyone
,
and
yet
Lucy
makes
this
*NL*
difficulty
when
we
try
to
give
her
some
little
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Lucy
hardened
her
heart
.
It
was
no
good
being
kind
to
Miss
Bartlett
.
*NL*
She
had
tried
herself
too
often
and
too
recently
.
One
might
lay
up
*NL*
treasure
in
heaven
by
the
attempt
,
but
one
enriched
neither
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
nor
any
one
else
upon
earth
.
She
was
reduced
to
saying
:
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
help
it
,
mother
.
I
do
n't
like
Charlotte
.
I
admit
it
's
horrid
of
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
your
own
account
,
you
told
her
as
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
would
leave
Florence
so
stupidly
.
She
flurried
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ghosts
were
returning
;
they
filled
Italy
,
they
were
even
usurping
*NL*
the
places
she
had
known
as
a
child
.
The
Sacred
Lake
would
never
be
the
*NL*
same
again
,
and
,
on
Sunday
week
,
something
would
even
happen
to
Windy
*NL*
Corner
.
How
would
she
fight
against
ghosts
?
For
a
moment
the
visible
*NL*
world
faded
away
,
and
memories
and
emotions
alone
seemed
real
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
Miss
Bartlett
must
come
,
since
she
boils
eggs
so
well
,
''
*NL*
said
Cecil
,
who
was
in
rather
a
happier
frame
of
mind
,
thanks
to
the
*NL*
admirable
cooking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mean
the
egg
was
WELL
boiled
,
''
corrected
Freddy
,
``
because
in
*NL*
point
of
fact
she
forgot
to
take
it
off
,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
for
eggs
.
I
only
meant
how
jolly
kind
she
seemed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
frowned
again
.
Oh
,
these
Honeychurches
!
Eggs
,
boilers
,
hydrangeas
,
*NL*
maids
--
of
such
were
their
lives
compact
.
``
May
me
and
Lucy
get
down
from
*NL*
our
chairs
?
''
he
asked
,
with
scarcely
veiled
insolence
.
``
We
do
n't
want
no

Chapter
XIV
:
How
Lucy
Faced
the
External
Situation
Bravely
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
Miss
Bartlett
accepted
.
And
,
equally
of
course
,
she
felt
sure
*NL*
that
she
would
prove
a
nuisance
,
and
begged
to
be
given
an
inferior
*NL*
spare
room
--
something
with
no
view
,
anything
.
Her
love
to
Lucy
.
And
,
*NL*
equally
of
course
,
George
Emerson
could
come
to
tennis
on
the
Sunday
*NL*
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
faced
the
situation
bravely
,
though
,
like
most
of
us
,
she
only
*NL*
faced
the
situation
that
encompassed
her
.
She
never
gazed
inwards
.
If
at
*NL*
times
strange
images
rose
from
the
depths
,
she
put
them
down
to
nerves
.
*NL*
When
Cecil
brought
the
Emersons
to
Summer
Street
,
it
had
upset
her
*NL*
nerves
.
Charlotte
would
burnish
up
past
foolishness
,
and
this
might
*NL*
upset
her
nerves
.
She
was
nervous
at
night
.
When
she
talked
to
*NL*
George
--
they
met
again
almost
immediately
at
the
Rectory
--
his
voice
*NL*
moved
her
deeply
,
and
she
wished
to
remain
near
him
.
How
dreadful
if
she
*NL*
really
wished
to
remain
near
him
!
Of
course
,
the
wish
was
due
to
nerves
,
*NL*
which
love
to
play
such
perverse
tricks
upon
us
.
Once
she
had
suffered
*NL*
from
``
things
that
came
out
of
nothing
and
meant
she
did
n't
know
what
.
''
*NL*
Now
Cecil
had
explained
psychology
to
her
one
wet
afternoon
,
and
all
the
*NL*
troubles
of
youth
in
an
unknown
world
could
be
dismissed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
obvious
enough
for
the
reader
to
conclude
,
``
She
loves
young
*NL*
Emerson
.
''
A
reader
in
Lucy
's
place
would
not
find
it
obvious
.
Life
is
*NL*
easy
to
chronicle
,
but
bewildering
to
practice
,
and
we
welcome
``
nerves
''
*NL*
or
any
other
shibboleth
that
will
cloak
our
personal
desire
.
She
loved
*NL*
Cecil
;
George
made
her
nervous
;
will
the
reader
explain
to
her
that
the
*NL*
phrases
should
have
been
reversed
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
external
situation
--
she
will
face
that
bravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meeting
at
the
Rectory
had
passed
off
well
enough
.
Standing
between
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
and
Cecil
,
she
had
made
a
few
temperate
allusions
to
Italy
,
*NL*
and
George
had
replied
.
She
was
anxious
to
show
that
she
was
not
shy
,
*NL*
and
was
glad
that
he
did
not
seem
shy
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice
fellow
,
''
said
Mr.
Beebe
afterwards
``
He
will
work
off
his
*NL*
crudities
in
time
.
I
rather
mistrust
young
men
who
slip
into
life
*NL*
gracefully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
said
,
``
He
seems
in
better
spirits
.
He
laughs
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
clergyman
.
``
He
is
waking
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
all
.
But
,
as
the
week
wore
on
,
more
of
her
defences
fell
,
*NL*
and
she
entertained
an
image
that
had
physical
beauty
.
In
spite
of
the
*NL*
clearest
directions
,
Miss
Bartlett
contrived
to
bungle
her
arrival
.
*NL*
She
was
due
at
the
South-Eastern
station
at
Dorking
,
whither
Mrs.
*NL*
Honeychurch
drove
to
meet
her
.
She
arrived
at
the
London
and
Brighton
*NL*
station
,
and
had
to
hire
a
cab
up
.
No
one
was
at
home
except
Freddy
*NL*
and
his
friend
,
who
had
to
stop
their
tennis
and
to
entertain
her
for
*NL*
a
solid
hour
.
Cecil
and
Lucy
turned
up
at
four
o'clock
,
and
these
,
with
*NL*
little
Minnie
Beebe
,
made
a
somewhat
lugubrious
sextette
upon
the
upper
*NL*
lawn
for
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
forgive
myself
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
who
kept
on
rising
*NL*
from
her
seat
,
and
had
to
be
begged
by
the
united
company
to
remain
.
*NL*
``
I
have
upset
everything
.
Bursting
in
on
young
people
!
But
I
insist
on
*NL*
paying
for
my
cab
up
.
Grant
that
,
at
any
rate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
visitors
never
do
such
dreadful
things
,
''
said
Lucy
,
while
her
*NL*
brother
,
in
whose
memory
the
boiled
egg
had
already
grown
unsubstantial
,
*NL*
exclaimed
in
irritable
tones
:
``
Just
what
I
've
been
trying
to
convince
*NL*
Cousin
Charlotte
of
,
Lucy
,
for
the
last
half
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
feel
myself
an
ordinary
visitor
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
her
frayed
glove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
if
you
'd
really
rather
.
Five
shillings
,
and
I
gave
a
bob
to
*NL*
the
driver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
looked
in
her
purse
.
Only
sovereigns
and
pennies
.
Could
*NL*
any
one
give
her
change
?
Freddy
had
half
a
quid
and
his
friend
had
four
*NL*
half-crowns
.
Miss
Bartlett
accepted
their
moneys
and
then
said
:
``
But
who
*NL*
am
I
to
give
the
sovereign
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
leave
it
all
till
mother
comes
back
,
''
suggested
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
;
your
mother
may
take
quite
a
long
drive
now
that
she
is
not
*NL*
hampered
with
me
.
We
all
have
our
little
foibles
,
and
mine
is
the
prompt
*NL*
settling
of
accounts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Freddy
's
friend
,
Mr.
Floyd
,
made
the
one
remark
of
his
that
need
be
*NL*
quoted
:
he
offered
to
toss
Freddy
for
Miss
Bartlett
's
quid
.
A
solution
*NL*
seemed
in
sight
,
and
even
Cecil
,
who
had
been
ostentatiously
drinking
*NL*
his
tea
at
the
view
,
felt
the
eternal
attraction
of
Chance
,
and
turned
*NL*
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
did
not
do
,
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
--
please
--
I
know
I
am
a
sad
spoil-sport
,
but
it
would
make
me
*NL*
wretched
.
I
should
practically
be
robbing
the
one
who
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Freddy
owes
me
fifteen
shillings
,
''
interposed
Cecil
.
``
So
it
will
work
*NL*
out
right
if
you
give
the
pound
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
shillings
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
dubiously
.
``
How
is
that
,
Mr.
*NL*
Vyse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
do
n't
you
see
,
Freddy
paid
your
cab
.
Give
me
the
pound
,
and
we
*NL*
shall
avoid
this
deplorable
gambling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
,
who
was
poor
at
figures
,
became
bewildered
and
rendered
*NL*
up
the
sovereign
,
amidst
the
suppressed
gurgles
of
the
other
youths
.
For
*NL*
a
moment
Cecil
was
happy
.
He
was
playing
at
nonsense
among
his
peers
.
*NL*
Then
he
glanced
at
Lucy
,
in
whose
face
petty
anxieties
had
marred
the
*NL*
smiles
.
In
January
he
would
rescue
his
Leonardo
from
this
stupefying
*NL*
twaddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
see
that
!
''
exclaimed
Minnie
Beebe
who
had
narrowly
watched
*NL*
the
iniquitous
transaction
.
``
I
do
n't
see
why
Mr.
Vyse
is
to
have
the
*NL*
quid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
of
the
fifteen
shillings
and
the
five

they
said
solemnly
.
*NL*
``
Fifteen

five
shillings

one
pound

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't

*NL*
*NL*
They
tried
to
stifle
her
with
cake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

you
.
I
'm
done

*NL*
``

had

Miss
Bartlett

reddening
.
``

reminding

a
crown

'll

young

rising
with
decision

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
--
Lucy
--
what
a
nuisance
I
am

''
protested
Miss
Bartlett
,
and
*NL*
followed
her
across
the
lawn
.
Lucy
tripped
ahead
,
simulating
hilarity
.
*NL*
When
they
were
out
of
earshot
Miss
Bartlett
stopped
her
wails
and
said
*NL*
quite
briskly
:
``
Have
you
told
him
about
him
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't

''
replied
Lucy
,
and
then
could
have
bitten
her
tongue
*NL*
for
understanding
so
quickly
what
her
cousin
meant
.
``
Let
me
see
--
a
*NL*
sovereign
's
worth
of
silver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
escaped
into
the
kitchen
.
Miss
Bartlett
's
sudden
transitions
were
*NL*
too
uncanny
.
It
sometimes
seemed
as
if
she
planned
every
word
she
spoke
*NL*
or
caused
to
be
spoken
;
as
if
all
this
worry
about
cabs
and
change
had
*NL*
been
a
ruse
to
surprise
the
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't
told
Cecil
or
any
one

she
remarked
,
when
she
returned
.
*NL*
``

Miss
Bartlett
was
in
the
drawing-room
,
gazing
at
the
photograph
of
St.
*NL*
John
ascending
,
which
had
been
framed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dreadful
!
''
she
murmured
,
``
how
more
than
dreadful
,
if
Mr.
Vyse
*NL*
should
come
to
hear
of
it
from
some
other
source

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no

Charlotte

said
the
girl
,
entering
the
battle
.
``
George
Emerson
*NL*
is
all
right
,
and
what
other
source
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
considered
.
``
For
instance
,
the
driver

I
saw
him
looking
*NL*
through
the
bushes
at
you
,
remember
he
had
a
violet
between
his
teeth

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
shuddered
a
little
.
``
We
shall
get
the
silly
affair
on
our
nerves
*NL*
if
we
are
n't
careful

How
could
a
Florentine
cab-driver
ever
get
hold
of
*NL*
Cecil
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
think
of
every
possibility

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
perhaps
old
Mr.

he
is
certain
to
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care

I
was
grateful
to
you
for
your

but
*NL*
even
if
the
news
does
get
round
,
I
think
I
can
trust
Cecil

laugh
at
*NL*
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
contradict
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

to
laugh
at
it

But
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
she
could
not
trust
*NL*
him
,
for
he
desired
her
untouched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

dear

you

Perhaps
gentlemen
are
different

what
*NL*
they
were

young

Ladies
are
certainly
different

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

She
struck
at
her
playfully
.
``
You
kind

do

First
you

you

`
Tell

Which
is
it

Quick

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
sighed
``
I
am
no
match
for
you
in
conversation

I
*NL*
blush
when
I
think
how
I
interfered
at
Florence
,
and
you
so
well
able
*NL*
to
look
after
yourself
,
and
so
much
cleverer
in
all
ways
than
I
am

You

will
never
forgive
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
out

They

*NL*
*NL*
For
the
air
rang
with
the
shrieks
of
Minnie
,
who
was
being
scalped
with
*NL*
a
teaspoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
one
moment
--
we
may
not
have
this
chance
for

young
one
yet
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I

*NL*
``
What
happened

*NL*
*NL*

We
met

Rectory

*NL*

taking
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

He
talked
about
Italy

like
any
other
person

It
is
really
all
*NL*
right

What
advantage
would
he
get
from
being
a
cad
,
to
put
it
bluntly
?
*NL*
I
do
wish
I
could
make
you
see
it
my

any

*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
a

always
a
cad

That
is
my
poor
opinion

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
paused
.
``
Cecil
said
one
day
--
and
I
thought
it
so
profound
--
that
*NL*
there
are
two
kinds
of
cads
--
the
conscious
and
the
subconscious
.
''
She
*NL*
paused
again
,
to
be
sure
of
doing
justice
to
Cecil
's
profundity
.
Through
*NL*
the
window
she
saw
Cecil
himself
,
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
novel
.
It
*NL*
was
a
new
one
from
Smith
's
library
.
Her
mother
must
have
returned
from
*NL*
the
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
a
cad
,
always
a
cad
,
''
droned
Miss
Bartlett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
mean
by
subconscious
is
that
Emerson
lost
his
head
.
I
fell
into
*NL*
all
those
violets
,
and
he
was
silly
and
surprised
.
I
do
n't
think
we
*NL*
ought
to
blame
him
very
much
.
It
makes
such
a
difference
when
you
see
a
*NL*
person
with
beautiful
things
behind
him
unexpectedly
.
It
really
does
;
*NL*
it
makes
an
enormous
difference
,
and
he
lost
his
head
:
he
does
n't
admire
*NL*
me
,
or
any
of
that
nonsense
,
one
straw
.
Freddy
rather
likes
him
,
and
*NL*
has
asked
him
up
here
on
Sunday
,
so
you
can
judge
for
yourself
.
He
has
*NL*
improved
;
he
does
n't
always
look
as
if
he
's
going
to
burst
into
*NL*
tears
.
He
is
a
clerk
in
the
General
Manager
's
office
at
one
of
the
big
*NL*
railways
--
not
a
porter
!
and
runs
down
to
his
father
for
week-ends
.
Papa
*NL*
was
to
do
with
journalism
,
but
is
rheumatic
and
has
retired
.
There
!
*NL*
Now
for
the
garden
.
''
She
took
hold
of
her
guest
by
the
arm
.
``
Suppose
we
*NL*
do
n't
talk
about
this
silly
Italian
business
any
more
.
We
want
you
to
*NL*
have
a
nice
restful
visit
at
Windy
Corner
,
with
no
worriting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
thought
this
rather
a
good
speech
.
The
reader
may
have
detected
*NL*
an
unfortunate
slip
in
it
.
Whether
Miss
Bartlett
detected
the
slip
one
*NL*
can
not
say
,
for
it
is
impossible
to
penetrate
into
the
minds
of
elderly
*NL*
people
.
She
might
have
spoken
further
,
but
they
were
interrupted
by
the
*NL*
entrance
of
her
hostess
.
Explanations
took
place
,
and
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
them
Lucy
escaped
,
the
images
throbbing
a
little
more
vividly
in
her
*NL*
brain
.

Chapter
XV
:
The
Disaster
Within
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sunday
after
Miss
Bartlett
's
arrival
was
a
glorious
day
,
like
most
*NL*
of
the
days
of
that
year
.
In
the
Weald
,
autumn
approached
,
breaking
up
*NL*
the
green
monotony
of
summer
,
touching
the
parks
with
the
grey
bloom
of
*NL*
mist
,
the
beech-trees
with
russet
,
the
oak-trees
with
gold
.
Up
on
the
*NL*
heights
,
battalions
of
black
pines
witnessed
the
change
,
themselves
*NL*
unchangeable
.
Either
country
was
spanned
by
a
cloudless
sky
,
and
in
*NL*
either
arose
the
tinkle
of
church
bells
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
garden
of
Windy
Corners
was
deserted
except
for
a
red
book
,
which
*NL*
lay
sunning
itself
upon
the
gravel
path
.
From
the
house
came
incoherent
*NL*
sounds
,
as
of
females
preparing
for
worship
.
``
The
men
say
they
wo
n't
*NL*
go
''
--
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
blame
them
''
--
Minnie
says
,
``
need
she
go
?
''
--
``
Tell
*NL*
her
,
no
nonsense
''
--
``
Anne
!
Mary
!
Hook
me
behind
!
''
--
``
Dearest
Lucia
,
may
I
*NL*
trespass
upon
you
for
a
pin
?
''
For
Miss
Bartlett
had
announced
that
she
*NL*
at
all
events
was
one
for
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
rose
higher
on
its
journey
,
guided
,
not
by
Phaethon
,
but
by
*NL*
Apollo
,
competent
,
unswerving
,
divine
.
Its
rays
fell
on
the
ladies
*NL*
whenever
they
advanced
towards
the
bedroom
windows
;
on
Mr.
Beebe
down
*NL*
at
Summer
Street
as
he
smiled
over
a
letter
from
Miss
Catharine
Alan
;
on
*NL*
George
Emerson
cleaning
his
father
's
boots
;
and
lastly
,
to
complete
the
*NL*
catalogue
of
memorable
things
,
on
the
red
book
mentioned
previously
.
The
*NL*
ladies
move
,
Mr.
Beebe
moves
,
George
moves
,
and
movement
may
engender
*NL*
shadow
.
But
this
book
lies
motionless
,
to
be
caressed
all
the
morning
*NL*
by
the
sun
and
to
raise
its
covers
slightly
,
as
though
acknowledging
the
*NL*
caress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Lucy
steps
out
of
the
drawing-room
window
.
Her
new
cerise
*NL*
dress
has
been
a
failure
,
and
makes
her
look
tawdry
and
wan
.
At
her
*NL*
throat
is
a
garnet
brooch
,
on
her
finger
a
ring
set
with
rubies
--
an
*NL*
engagement
ring
.
Her
eyes
are
bent
to
the
Weald
.
She
frowns
a
*NL*
little
--
not
in
anger
,
but
as
a
brave
child
frowns
when
he
is
trying
not
*NL*
to
cry
.
In
all
that
expanse
no
human
eye
is
looking
at
her
,
and
she
may
*NL*
frown
unrebuked
and
measure
the
spaces
that
yet
survive
between
Apollo
*NL*
and
the
western
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
!
Lucy
!
What
's
that
book
?
Who
's
been
taking
a
book
out
of
the
shelf
*NL*
and
leaving
it
about
to
spoil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
the
library
book

Cecil
's
been

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
pick
it
up
,
and
do
n't
stand
idling
there
like

flamingo

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
picked
up
the
book
and
glanced
at
the
title
listlessly
,
Under
a
*NL*
Loggia
.
She
no
longer
read
novels
herself
,
devoting
all
her
spare
time
*NL*
to
solid
literature
in
the
hope
of
catching
Cecil
up
.
It
was
dreadful
*NL*
how
little
she
knew
,
and
even
when
she
thought
she
knew
a
thing
,
like
*NL*
the
Italian
painters
,
she
found
she
had
forgotten
it
.
Only
this
morning
*NL*
she
had
confused
Francesco
Francia
with
Piero
della
Francesca
,
and
Cecil
*NL*
had
said
,
``
What
!
you
are
n't
forgetting
your
Italy
already
?
''
And
this
too
*NL*
had
lent
anxiety
to
her
eyes
when
she
saluted
the
dear
view
and
the
*NL*
dear
garden
in
the
foreground
,
and
above
them
,
scarcely
conceivable
*NL*
elsewhere
,
the
dear
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
--
have
you
a
sixpence
for
Minnie
and
a
shilling
for
yourself

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hastened
in
to
her
mother
,
who
was
rapidly
working
herself
into
a
*NL*
Sunday
fluster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

*NL*
*NL*
Paganism
is
infectious
--
more
infectious
than
diphtheria
or
piety
--
and
*NL*
the
Rector
's
niece
was
taken
to
church
protesting
.
As
usual
,
she
did
n't
*NL*
see
why
.
Why
should
n't
she
sit
in
the
sun
with
the
young
men
?
The
*NL*
young
men
,
who
had
now
appeared
,
mocked
her
with
ungenerous
words
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Honeychurch
defended
orthodoxy
,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
,
dressed
in
the
very
height
of
the
fashion
,
came
strolling
down
*NL*
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Marian
,
I
am
very
sorry
,
but
I
have
no
small

sovereigns

crowns

*NL*
``
Yes

easily

Jump
in

Gracious

how
smart

What
a

You
put
us
all
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
did
not
wear
my
best
rags
and
tatters
now
,
when
should
I
wear
*NL*
them

said
Miss
Bartlett
reproachfully
.
She
got
into
the
victoria
and
*NL*
placed
herself
with
her
back
to
the
horse
.
The
necessary
roar
ensued
,
*NL*
and
then
they
drove
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
!
Be
good
!
''
called
out
Cecil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
bit
her
lip
,
for
the
tone
was
sneering
.
On
the
subject
of
``
church
*NL*
and
so
on
''
they
had
had
rather
an
unsatisfactory
conversation
.
He
had
*NL*
said
that
people
ought
to
overhaul
themselves
,
and
she
did
not
want
to
*NL*
overhaul
herself
;
she
did
not
know
it
was
done
.
Honest
orthodoxy
*NL*
Cecil
respected
,
but
he
always
assumed
that
honesty
is
the
result
of
a
*NL*
spiritual
crisis
;
he
could
not
imagine
it
as
a
natural
birthright
,
that
*NL*
might
grow
heavenward
like
flowers
.
All
that
he
said
on
this
subject
*NL*
pained
her
,
though
he
exuded
tolerance
from
every
pore
;
somehow
the
*NL*
Emersons
were
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
the
Emersons
after
church
.
There
was
a
line
of
carriages
down
*NL*
the
road
,
and
the
Honeychurch
vehicle
happened
to
be
opposite
Cissie
*NL*
Villa
.
To
save
time
,
they
walked
over
the
green
to
it
,
and
found
father
*NL*
and
son
smoking
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Introduce
me
,
''
said
her
mother
.
``
Unless
the
young
man
considers
that
he
*NL*
knows
me
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
probably
did
;
but
Lucy
ignored
the
Sacred
Lake
and
introduced
them
*NL*
formally
.
Old
Mr.
Emerson
claimed
her
with
much
warmth
,
and
said
how
*NL*
glad
he
was
that
she
was
going
to
be
married
.
She
said
yes
,
she
was
glad
*NL*
too
;
and
then
,
as
Miss
Bartlett
and
Minnie
were
lingering
behind
with
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
,
she
turned
the
conversation
to
a
less
disturbing
topic
,
and
*NL*
asked
him
how
he
liked
his
new
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
,
''
he
replied
,
but
there
was
a
note
of
offence
in
his
voice
;
*NL*
she
had
never
known
him
offended
before
.
He
added
:
``
We
find
,
though

*NL*
that
the
Miss
Alans
were
coming
,
and
that
we
have
turned
them
out
.
Women
*NL*
mind
such
a
thing
.
I
am
very
much
upset
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
that
there
was
some
misunderstanding
,
''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
*NL*
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
landlord
was
told
that
we
should
be
a
different
type
of
person
,
''
*NL*
said
George
,
who
seemed
disposed
to
carry
the
matter
further
.
``
He
*NL*
thought
we
should
be
artistic
.
He
is
disappointed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
wonder
whether
we
ought
to
write
to
the
Miss
Alans
and
offer
to
*NL*
give
it
up
.
What
do
you
think
?
''
He
appealed
to
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
stop
now
you
have
come
,
''
said
Lucy
lightly
.
She
must
avoid
*NL*
censuring
Cecil
.
For
it
was
on
Cecil
that
the
little
episode
turned
,
*NL*
though
his
name
was
never
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
George
says
.
He
says
that
the
Miss
Alans
must
go
to
the
wall
.
Yet
it
*NL*
does
seem
so
unkind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
only
a
certain
amount
of
kindness
in
the
world
,
''
said
George
,
*NL*
watching
the
sunlight
flash
on
the
panels
of
the
passing
carriages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Honeychurch
.
``
That
's
exactly
what
I
say
.
Why
all
*NL*
this
twiddling
and
twaddling
over
two
Miss
Alans
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
certain
amount
of
kindness
,
just
as
there
is
a
certain
*NL*
amount
of
light
,
''
he
continued
in
measured
tones
.
``
We
cast
a
shadow
*NL*
on
something
wherever
we
stand
,
and
it
is
no
good
moving
from
place
to
*NL*
place
to
save
things
;
because
the
shadow
always
follows
.
Choose
a
place
*NL*
where
you
wo
n't
do
harm
--
yes
,
choose
a
place
where
you
wo
n't
do
very
*NL*
much
harm
,
and
stand
in
it
for
all
you
are
worth
,
facing
the
sunshine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Emerson
,
I
see
you
're
clever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
're
going
to
be
clever
.
I
hope
you
did
n't
go
behaving
like
*NL*
that
to
poor
Freddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
's
eyes
laughed
,
and
Lucy
suspected
that
he
and
her
mother
would
*NL*
get
on
rather
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
behaved
that
way
to
me
.
It
is
his
*NL*
philosophy
.
Only
he
starts
life
with
it
;
and
I
have
tried
the
Note
of
*NL*
Interrogation
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
DO
you
mean
?
No
,
never
mind
what
you
mean
.
Do
n't
explain
.
He
looks
*NL*
forward
to
seeing
you
this
afternoon
.
Do
you
play
tennis
?
Do
you
mind
*NL*
tennis
on
Sunday
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
mind
tennis
on
Sunday
!
George
,
after
his
education
,
distinguish
*NL*
between
Sunday
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
George
does
n't
mind
tennis
on
Sunday
.
No
more
do
I.
That
's
*NL*
settled
.
Mr.
Emerson
,
if
you
could
come
with
your
son
we
should
be
so
*NL*
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thanked
her
,
but
the
walk
sounded
rather
far
;
he
could
only
potter
*NL*
about
in
these
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
George
:
``
And
then
he
wants
to
give
up
his
house
to
the
*NL*
Miss
Alans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
said
George
,
and
put
his
arm
round
his
father
's
neck
.
The
*NL*
kindness
that
Mr.
Beebe
and
Lucy
had
always
known
to
exist
in
him
came
*NL*
out
suddenly
,
like
sunlight
touching
a
vast
landscape
--
a
touch
of
the
*NL*
morning
sun
?
She
remembered
that
in
all
his
perversities
he
had
never
*NL*
spoken
against
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
our
cousin
,
Miss
Bartlett
,
''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
pleasantly
.
*NL*
``
You
met
her
with
my
daughter
in
Florence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
!
''
said
the
old
man
,
and
made
as
if
he
would
come
out
of
the
*NL*
garden
to
meet
the
lady
.
Miss
Bartlett
promptly
got
into
the
victoria
.
*NL*
Thus
entrenched
,
she
emitted
a
formal
bow
.
It
was
the
pension
Bertolini
*NL*
again
,
the
dining-table
with
the
decanters
of
water
and
wine
.
It
was
the
*NL*
old
,
old
battle
of
the
room
with
the
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
did
not
respond
to
the
bow
.
Like
any
boy
,
he
blushed
and
was
*NL*
ashamed
;
he
knew
that
the
chaperon
remembered
.
He
said
:
``
I
--
I
'll
come
up
*NL*
to
tennis
if
I
can
manage
it
,
''
and
went
into
the
house
.
Perhaps
anything
*NL*
that
he
did
would
have
pleased
Lucy
,
but
his
awkwardness
went
straight
*NL*
to
her
heart
;
men
were
not
gods
after
all
,
but
as
human
and
as
clumsy
as
*NL*
girls
;
even
men
might
suffer
from
unexplained
desires
,
and
need
help
.
To
*NL*
one
of
her
upbringing
,
and
of
her
destination
,
the
weakness
of
men
was
a
*NL*
truth
unfamiliar
,
but
she
had
surmised
it
at
Florence
,
when
George
threw
*NL*
her
photographs
into
the
River
Arno
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
do
n't
go
,
''
cried
his
father
,
who
thought
it
a
great
treat
for
*NL*
people
if
his
son
would
talk
to
them
.
``
George
has
been
in
such
good
*NL*
spirits
today
,
and
I
am
sure
he
will
end
by
coming
up
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
caught
her
cousin
's
eye
.
Something
in
its
mute
appeal
made
her
*NL*
reckless
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
raising
her
voice
,
``
I
do
hope
he
will
.
''
Then
*NL*
she
went
to
the
carriage
and
murmured
,
``
The
old
man
has
n't
been
told
;
*NL*
I
knew
it
was
all
right
.
''
Mrs.
Honeychurch
followed
her
,
and
they
drove
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Satisfactory
that
Mr.
Emerson
had
not
been
told
of
the
Florence
*NL*
escapade
;
yet
Lucy
's
spirits
should
not
have
leapt
up
as
if
she
had
*NL*
sighted
the
ramparts
of
heaven
.
Satisfactory
;
yet
surely
she
greeted
*NL*
it
with
disproportionate
joy
.
All
the
way
home
the
horses
'
hoofs
sang
a
*NL*
tune
to
her
:
``
He
has
not
told
,
he
has
not
told
.
''
Her
brain
expanded
the
*NL*
melody
:
``
He
has
not
told
his
father
--
to
whom
he
tells
all
things
.
It
was
*NL*
not
an
exploit
.
He
did
not
laugh
at
me
when
I
had
gone
.
''
She
raised
her
*NL*
hand
to
her
cheek
.
``
He
does
not
love
me
.
No
.
How
terrible
if
he
did
!
But
*NL*
he
has
not
told
.
He
will
not
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
longed
to
shout
the
words
:
``
It
is
all
right
.
It
's
a
secret
between
*NL*
us
two
for
ever
.
Cecil
will
never
hear
.
''
She
was
even
glad
that
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
had
made
her
promise
secrecy
,
that
last
dark
evening
at
*NL*
Florence
,
when
they
had
knelt
packing
in
his
room
.
The
secret
,
big
or
*NL*
little
,
was
guarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
three
English
people
knew
of
it
in
the
world
.
Thus
she
interpreted
*NL*
her
joy
.
She
greeted
Cecil
with
unusual
radiance
,
because
she
felt
so
*NL*
safe
.
As
he
helped
her
out
of
the
carriage
,
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emersons
have
been
so
nice
.
George
Emerson
has
improved
*NL*
enormously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
my
proteges
?
''
asked
Cecil
,
who
took
no
real
interest
in
them
,
*NL*
and
had
long
since
forgotten
his
resolution
to
bring
them
to
Windy
*NL*
Corner
for
educational
purposes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proteges
!
''
she
exclaimed
with
some
warmth
.
For
the
only
relationship
*NL*
which
Cecil
conceived
was
feudal
:
that
of
protector
and
protected
.
He
*NL*
had
no
glimpse
of
the
comradeship
after
which
the
girl
's
soul
yearned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
see
for
yourself
how
your
proteges
are
.
George
Emerson
is
*NL*
coming
up
this
afternoon
.
He
is
a
most
interesting
man
to
talk
to
.
Only
*NL*
do
n't
--
''
She
nearly
said
,
``
Do
n't
protect
him
.
''
But
the
bell
was
ringing
*NL*
for
lunch
,
and
,
as
often
happened
,
Cecil
had
paid
no
great
attention
to
*NL*
her
remarks
.
Charm
,
not
argument
,
was
to
be
her
forte
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lunch
was
a
cheerful
meal
.
Generally
Lucy
was
depressed
at
meals
.
Some
*NL*
one
had
to
be
soothed
--
either
Cecil
or
Miss
Bartlett
or
a
Being
not
*NL*
visible
to
the
mortal
eye
--
a
Being
who
whispered
to
her
soul
:
``
It
*NL*
will
not
last
,
this
cheerfulness
.
In
January
you
must
go
to
London
to
*NL*
entertain
the
grandchildren
of
celebrated
men
.
''
But
to-day
she
felt
she
*NL*
had
received
a
guarantee
.
Her
mother
would
always
sit
there
,
her
brother
*NL*
here
.
The
sun
,
though
it
had
moved
a
little
since
the
morning
,
would
*NL*
never
be
hidden
behind
the
western
hills
.
After
luncheon
they
asked
her
*NL*
to
play
.
She
had
seen
Gluck
's
Armide
that
year
,
and
played
from
memory
*NL*
the
music
of
the
enchanted
garden
--
the
music
to
which
Renaud
approaches
,
*NL*
beneath
the
light
of
an
eternal
dawn
,
the
music
that
never
gains
,
never
*NL*
wanes
,
but
ripples
for
ever
like
the
tideless
seas
of
fairyland
.
Such
*NL*
music
is
not
for
the
piano
,
and
her
audience
began
to
get
restive
,
*NL*
and
Cecil
,
sharing
the
discontent
,
called
out
:
``
Now
play
us
the
other
*NL*
garden
--
the
one
in
Parsifal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
closed
the
instrument
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
dutiful
,
''
said
her
mother
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fearing
that
she
had
offended
Cecil
,
she
turned
quickly
round
.
There
*NL*
George
was
.
He
had
crept
in
without
interrupting
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
had
no
idea
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
getting
very
red
;
and
then
,
without
*NL*
a
word
of
greeting
,
she
reopened
the
piano
.
Cecil
should
have
the
*NL*
Parsifal
,
and
anything
else
that
he
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
performer
has
changed
her
mind
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
perhaps
*NL*
implying
,
she
will
play
the
music
to
Mr.
Emerson
.
Lucy
did
not
know
*NL*
what
to
do
nor
even
what
she
wanted
to
do
.
She
played
a
few
bars
of
the
*NL*
Flower
Maidens
'
song
very
badly
and
then
she
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
vote
tennis
,
''
said
Freddy
,
disgusted
at
the
scrappy
entertainment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
so
do
I.
''
Once
more
she
closed
the
unfortunate
piano
.
``
I
vote
you
*NL*
have
a
men
's
four
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
me
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Cecil
.
``
I
will
not
spoil
the
set
.
''
He
*NL*
never
realized
that
it
may
be
an
act
of
kindness
in
a
bad
player
to
make
*NL*
up
a
fourth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
along
Cecil
.
I
'm
bad
,
Floyd
's
rotten
,
and
so
I
dare
say
's
*NL*
Emerson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
corrected
him
:
``
I
am
not
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
looked
down
one
's
nose
at
this
.
``
Then
certainly
I
wo
n't
play
,
''
said
*NL*
Cecil
,
while
Miss
Bartlett
,
under
the
impression
that
she
was
snubbing
*NL*
George
,
added
:
``
I
agree
with
you
,
Mr.
Vyse
.
You
had
much
better
not
*NL*
play
.
Much
better
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
,
rushing
in
where
Cecil
feared
to
tread
,
announced
that
she
would
*NL*
play
.
``
I
shall
miss
every
ball
anyway
,
so
what
does
it
matter
?
''
But
*NL*
Sunday
intervened
and
stamped
heavily
upon
the
kindly
suggestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
will
have
to
be
Lucy
,
''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
;
``
you
must
fall
*NL*
back
on
Lucy
.
There
is
no
other
way
out
of
it
.
Lucy
,
go
and
change
your
*NL*
frock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
's
Sabbath
was
generally
of
this
amphibious
nature
.
She
kept
it
*NL*
without
hypocrisy
in
the
morning
,
and
broke
it
without
reluctance
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
.
As
she
changed
her
frock
,
she
wondered
whether
Cecil
was
*NL*
sneering
at
her
;
really
she
must
overhaul
herself
and
settle
everything
*NL*
up
before
she
married
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Floyd
was
her
partner
.
She
liked
music
,
but
how
much
better
tennis
*NL*
seemed
.
How
much
better
to
run
about
in
comfortable
clothes
than
to
sit
*NL*
at
the
piano
and
feel
girt
under
the
arms
.
Once
more
music
appeared
to
*NL*
her
the
employment
of
a
child
.
George
served
,
and
surprised
her
by
his
*NL*
anxiety
to
win
.
She
remembered
how
he
had
sighed
among
the
tombs
at
*NL*
Santa
Croce
because
things
would
n't
fit
;
how
after
the
death
of
that
*NL*
obscure
Italian
he
had
leant
over
the
parapet
by
the
Arno
and
said
to
*NL*
her
:
``
I
shall
want
to
live
,
I
tell
you
.
''
He
wanted
to
live
now
,
to
win
*NL*
at
tennis
,
to
stand
for
all
he
was
worth
in
the
sun
--
the
sun
which
had
*NL*
begun
to
decline
and
was
shining
in
her
eyes
;
and
he
did
win
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
how
beautiful
the
Weald
looked
!
The
hills
stood
out
above
its
*NL*
radiance
,
as
Fiesole
stands
above
the
Tuscan
Plain
,
and
the
South
Downs
,
*NL*
if
one
chose
,
were
the
mountains
of
Carrara
.
She
might
be
forgetting
her
*NL*
Italy
,
but
she
was
noticing
more
things
in
her
England
.
One
could
play
*NL*
a

game
with
the
view
,
and
try
to
find
in
its
innumerable
folds
some
*NL*
town
or
village
that
would
do
for
Florence
.
Ah
,
how
beautiful
the
Weald
*NL*
looked
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
Cecil
claimed
her
.
He
chanced
to
be
in
a
lucid
critical
mood
,
*NL*
and
would
not
sympathize
with
exaltation
.
He
had
been
rather
a
nuisance
*NL*
all
through
the
tennis
,
for
the
novel
that
he
was
reading
was
so
bad
*NL*
that
he
was
obliged
to
read
it
aloud
to
others
.
He
would
stroll
round
*NL*
the
precincts
of
the
court
and
call
out
:
``
I
say
,
listen
to
this
,
Lucy
.
*NL*
Three
split
infinitives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dreadful
!
''
said
Lucy
,
and
missed
her
stroke
.
When
they
had
finished
*NL*
their
set
,
he
still
went
on
reading
;
there
was
some
murder
scene
,
and
*NL*
really
everyone
must
listen
to
it
.
Freddy
and
Mr.
Floyd
were
obliged
to
*NL*
hunt
for
a
lost
ball
in
the
laurels
,
but
the
other
two
acquiesced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
scene
is
laid
in
Florence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
fun
,
Cecil
!
Read
away
.
Come
,
Mr.
Emerson
,
sit
down
after
all
your
*NL*
energy
.
''
She
had
``
forgiven
''
George
,
as
she
put
it
,
and
she
made
a
point
*NL*
of
being
pleasant
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
over
the
net
and
sat
down
at
her
feet
asking
:
``
You
--
and
are
*NL*
you
tired
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
'm
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mind
being
beaten
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
going
to
answer
,
``
No
,
''
when
it
struck
her
that
she
did
mind
,
*NL*
so
she
answered
,
``
Yes
.
''
She
added
merrily
,
``
I
do
n't
see
you
're
such
*NL*
a
splendid

The
light
was
behind

it

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*

Cecil
,
with
an
upward
note

recollected
herself

interrupted

Lucy
burst
into
laughter
.
''

It

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
Excited
by
her
pleasant
afternoon
,
she
clapped
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
looked
up
.
``
Of
course
I
do
.
I
saw
her
the
day
I
arrived
at
Summer

Street

It
was
she
who
told
me
that
you
lived
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
n't
you
pleased

''
She
meant
``
to
see
Miss

''
but
when
he
bent
*NL*
down
to
the
grass
without
replying
,
it
struck
her
that
she
could
mean
*NL*
something
else
.
She
watched
his
head
,
which
was
almost
resting
against
*NL*
her
knee
,
and
she
thought
that
the
ears
were
reddening
.
``
No
wonder
the
*NL*
novel
's
bad
,
''
she
added
.
``
I
never
liked
Miss
Lavish
.
But
I
suppose
one
*NL*
ought
to
read
it

one

met
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
modern
books
are
bad

''
said
Cecil
,
who
was
annoyed
at
her
*NL*
inattention
,
and
vented
his
annoyance
on
literature
.
``
Every
one
writes
*NL*
for
money
in
these
days

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Cecil

!

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

so

I
will
inflict
Joseph
Emery
Prank
on

no

''
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
,
this
afternoon
seemed
such
a
twittering
sparrow
.
The
ups
and
*NL*
downs
in
his
voice
were
noticeable
,
but
they
did
not
affect
her
.
She
had
*NL*
dwelt
amongst
melody
and
movement
,
and
her
nerves
refused
to
answer
to
*NL*
the
clang
of
his
.
Leaving
him
to
be
annoyed
,
she
gazed
at
the
black
head
*NL*
again
.
She
did
not
want
to
stroke
it
,
but
she
saw
herself
wanting
to
*NL*
stroke
it
;
the
sensation
was
curious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
like
this
view
of
ours
,
Mr.
Emerson

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
notice
much
difference

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
they
're
all
alike

Because
all
that
matters
in
them
is
distance
*NL*
and
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
said
Cecil
,
uncertain
whether
the
remark
was
striking
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
''
--
he
looked
up
at
her
-LRB-
and
he
was
a
little
flushed
-RRB-
--
``
says
*NL*
that
there
is
only
one
perfect
view

the
view
of
the
sky
straight
over
*NL*
our
heads
,
and
that
all
these
views
on
earth
are
but
bungled
copies
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
your
father
has
been
reading
Dante
,
''
said
Cecil
,
fingering
the
*NL*
novel
,
which
alone
permitted
him
to
lead
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
told
us
another
day
that

are
really
crowds

crowds
of
trees
*NL*
and
houses

hills

and
are
bound
to
resemble
each
other
,
like
human
*NL*
crowds

that
the
power
they
have
over
us
is
sometimes
supernatural

for
the

reason

*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
's
lips
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
a
crowd
is
more
than
the
people

make
it
up

Something

added

one
knows
how

just
as
something
has
got
added

*NL*
*NL*
He
pointed
with
his
racquet
to
the
South
Downs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
splendid
idea
!

she
murmured
.

I
shall
enjoy
hearing
your

talk
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
an
absurd
account

said
Cecil
.
``
Also
*NL*
that
men
fall
into
two
classes

even
in
small
rooms

*NL*
*NL*
``

None

*NL*
Cecil
closed
the
novel
with
a
bang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Cecil

how
you
made
me
jump
!

just
remember

all
three
going
into

.
It
is
the
first
thing
that
I
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
got
up
;
the
man
was
ill-bred
--
he
had
n't
put
on
his
coat
after
*NL*
tennis
--
he
did
n't
do
.
He
would
have
strolled
away
if
Lucy
had
not
*NL*
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cecil
,
do
read
the
thing
about
the
view

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
while

is
here
to
entertain
us

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

read
away

I
think
nothing
's
funnier

to
hear

out
loud

If
Mr.

thinks
us
frivolous
,
he
can
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
struck
Cecil
as
subtle
,
and
pleased
him
.
It
put
their
visitor
in
*NL*
the
position
of
a
prig
.
Somewhat
mollified
,
he
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Emerson
,
go
and
find
tennis
balls
.
''
She
opened
the
book
.
Cecil
*NL*
must
have
his
reading
and
anything
else
that
he
liked
.
But
her
attention
*NL*
wandered
to
George
's
mother
,
who
--
according
to
Mr.
Eager
--
had
been
*NL*
murdered
in
the
sight
of
God
and
--
according
to
her
son
--
had
seen
as
far
as
*NL*
Hindhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
really
to
go

asked
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
of

not
really

she
answered

*NL*
*NL*
``
Chapter
two

said
Cecil
,
yawning
.
``
Find
me

it
is

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
two
was
found
,
and
she
glanced
at
its
opening
sentences
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
she
had
gone
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here

hand
me
the
book

*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
her
voice
saying
:

worth

's
too
silly

took
the

her
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Leonora
,

he
read

`
sat
pensive
and
alone
.
Before
her
lay
the
rich
*NL*
champaign
of
Tuscany
,
dotted
over
with
many
a
smiling
village
.
The
*NL*
season
was
spring
.

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Lavish
knew

somehow

had
printed

draggled
prose

for
Cecil
to
read
and
for
George
to
hear

A
golden
haze

he
read

He
read
:

Afar
off
the
towers

*NL*
while
the
bank
on
which
she
sat
was
carpeted
with
violets
.
All
*NL*
unobserved
Antonio
stole
up
behind
her
--

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lest
Cecil
should
see
her
face
she
turned
to
George
and
saw
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
:
''
`
There
came
from
his
lips
no
wordy
protestation
such
as
formal
*NL*
lovers
use
.
No
eloquence
was
his
,
nor
did
he
suffer
from
the
lack
of
it
.
*NL*
He
simply
enfolded
her
in
his
manly
arms
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
n't
the
passage
I
wanted
,
''
he
informed
them
,
``
there
is
another
*NL*
much
funnier
,
further
on
.
''
He
turned
over
the
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
we
go
in
to
tea
?
''
said
Lucy
,
whose
voice
remained
steady
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
led
the
way
up
the
garden
,
Cecil
following
her
,
George
last
.
She
*NL*
thought
a
disaster
was
averted
.
But
when
they
entered
the
shrubbery
*NL*
it
came
.
The
book
,
as
if
it
had
not
worked
mischief
enough
,
had
*NL*
been
forgotten
,
and
Cecil
must
go
back
for
it
;
and
George
,
who
loved
*NL*
passionately
,
must
blunder
against
her
in
the
narrow
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
''
she
gasped
,
and
,
for
the
second
time
,
was
kissed
by
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
no
more
was
possible
,
he
slipped
back
;
Cecil
rejoined
her
;
they
*NL*
reached
the
upper
lawn
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XVI
:
Lying
to
George
*NL*
*NL*
But
Lucy
had
developed
since
the
spring
.
That
is
to
say
,
she
was
now
*NL*
better
able
to
stifle
the
emotions
of
which
the
conventions
and
the
*NL*
world
disapprove
.
Though
the
danger
was
greater
,
she
was
not
shaken
by
*NL*
deep
sobs
.
She
said
to
Cecil
,
``
I
am
not
coming
in
to
tea
--
tell
mother
--
I
*NL*
must
write
some
letters
,
''
and
went
up
to
her
room
.
Then
she
prepared
*NL*
for
action
.
Love
felt
and
returned
,
love
which
our
bodies
exact
and
*NL*
our
hearts
have
transfigured
,
love
which
is
the
most
real
thing
that
*NL*
we
shall
ever
meet
,
reappeared
now
as
the
world
's
enemy
,
and
she
must
*NL*
stifle
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sent
for
Miss
Bartlett
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
contest
lay
not
between
love
and
duty
.
Perhaps
there
never
is
such
a
*NL*
contest
.
It
lay
between
the
real
and
the
pretended
,
and
Lucy
's
first
aim
*NL*
was
to
defeat
herself
.
As
her
brain
clouded
over
,
as
the
memory
of
the
*NL*
views
grew
dim
and
the
words
of
the
book
died
away
,
she
returned
to
her
*NL*
old
shibboleth
of
nerves
.
She
``
conquered
her
breakdown
.
''
Tampering
with
*NL*
the
truth
,
she
forgot
that
the
truth
had
ever
been
.
Remembering
that
she
*NL*
was
engaged
to
Cecil
,
she
compelled
herself
to
confused
remembrances
*NL*
of
George
;
he
was
nothing
to
her
;
he
never
had
been
anything
;
he
*NL*
had
behaved
abominably
;
she
had
never
encouraged
him
.
The
armour
of
*NL*
falsehood
is
subtly
wrought
out
of
darkness
,
and
hides
a
man
not
only
*NL*
from
others
,
but
from
his
own
soul
.
In
a
few
moments
Lucy
was
equipped
*NL*
for
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
too
awful
has
happened
,
''
she
began
,
as
soon
as
her
cousin
*NL*
arrived
.
``
Do
you
know
anything
about
Miss
Lavish
's
novel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
looked
surprised
,
and
said
that
she
had
not
read
the
book
,
*NL*
nor
known
that
it
was
published
;
Eleanor
was
a
reticent
woman
at
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a

Do

she
repeated

Charlotte

Charlotte
,
how
could
you
have
told
her
?
I
have
thought
before
speaking
;
*NL*
it
must
be
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Told
her
what
?
''
she
asked
,
with
growing
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
that
dreadful
afternoon
in
February
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
was
genuinely
moved
.
``
Oh
,
Lucy
,
dearest
girl
--
she
has
n't
*NL*
put
that
in
her
book
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
that
one
could
recognize
it

Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
never
--
never
--
never
more
shall
Eleanor
Lavish
be
a
friend
of

mine

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
did
tell

*NL*
*NL*

I
did
just
happen

tea
with

at
Rome

in

course
of

conversation

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Charlotte
--
what
about
the
promise
you
gave
me
when
we
were
packing

*NL*
Why
did
you
tell
Miss
Lavish
,
when
you
would

even
let
me
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
never

She
has
betrayed

*NL*
``
Why
did
you
tell
her

This
is
a
most
serious
thing

''
*NL*
*NL*
Why
does
any
one
tell
anything
?
The
question
is
eternal
,
and
it
was
not
*NL*
surprising
that
Miss
Bartlett
should
only
sigh
faintly
in
response
.
She
*NL*
had
done
wrong
--
she
admitted
it
,
she
only
hoped
that
she
had
not
done
*NL*
harm

she
had
told
Eleanor
in

strictest
confidence

*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
stamped
with
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cecil
happened
to
read
out

passage
aloud

upset

he
insulted
me
again

Ugh

Is
it
possible

such
brutes

Behind

were

walking
up
the
garden

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
burst
into
self-accusations
and
regrets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
be
done

Can
you
tell

your

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Lucy
,
wincing
at
the
word

``
I
see
now
why

You
knew

told

that
she
was
not
reliable

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Miss
Bartlett
's
turn
to
wince
.
``
However

said
the
girl
,
*NL*
despising
her
cousin
's
shiftiness
,
``
What
's
done
's
done

You
have
put
me

in
a

awkward
position

How
am
I
to
get
out
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
could
not
think
.
The
days
of
her
energy
were
over
.
She
was
*NL*
a
visitor
,
not
a
chaperon
,
and
a
discredited
visitor
at
that
.
She
stood
*NL*
with
clasped
hands
while
the
girl
worked
herself
into
the
necessary
*NL*
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must

that

have
such
a

That

why
I

sent
for
you

*NL*
What
's
wanted
is
a
man
with
a
whip

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
agreed
:
one
wanted
a
man
with
a
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

but
it
's
no
good
agreeing

What
's
to
be
DONE

We
women
go

maundering
on
.
What
DOES
a
girl
do
when
she
comes
across
a
cad
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
said
he
was
a
cad

Give
me
credit

that

From
the

bath

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

bother
the
credit

who
's
been
right

wrong

We

both
made
a

muddle
of
it

George
Emerson
is
still
down
the
garden
there
,
and
is
he
*NL*
to
be
left
unpunished
,
or
is
n't
he
?
I
want
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
was
absolutely
helpless
.
Her
own
exposure
had
unnerved
*NL*
her
,
and
thoughts
were
colliding
painfully
in
her
brain
.
She
moved
*NL*
feebly
to
the
window
,
and
tried
to
detect
the
cad
's
white
flannels
among
*NL*
the
laurels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
ready
enough
at
the
Bertolini
when
you
rushed
me
off
to
Rome

you
speak
again
to
him
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Willingly

I
move
heaven

earth

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
something
more

said
Lucy
contemptuously
.
``
Will
you
*NL*
speak

It

you

happened
because
you
broke
your
word

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
again

Eleanor
Lavish
be
a
friend

mine

''
*NL*
*NL*
Really
,
Charlotte
was
outdoing
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
or
no
,
please
;
yes

no

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
kind
of
thing

only
a
gentleman
can
settle

''
George
*NL*
Emerson
was
coming
up
the
garden
with
a
tennis
ball
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Lucy
,
with
an
angry
gesture
.
``
No
one
will
help
me
.
I
*NL*
will
speak
to
him
myself
.
''
And
immediately
she
realized
that
this
was
*NL*
what
her
cousin
had
intended
all
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
,
Emerson
!
''
called
Freddy
from
below
.
``
Found
the
lost
ball
?
Good
*NL*
man
!
Want
any
tea
?
''
And
there
was
an
irruption
from
the
house
on
to
the
*NL*
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lucy
,
but
that
is
brave
of
you
!
I
admire
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
gathered
round
George
,
who
beckoned
,
she
felt
,
over
the
*NL*
rubbish
,
the
sloppy
thoughts
,
the
furtive
yearnings
that
were
beginning
*NL*
to
cumber
her
soul
.
Her
anger
faded
at
the
sight
of
him
.
Ah
!
The
*NL*
Emersons
were
fine
people
in
their
way
.
She
had
to
subdue
a
rush
in
her
*NL*
blood
before
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Freddy
has
taken
him
into
the
dining-room
.
The
others
are
going
down
*NL*
the
garden

Come

Let
us
get
this
over
quickly

Come

I
want
you
in
the
*NL*
room

of
course

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
,
do
you
mind
doing
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
ask
such
a
ridiculous
question

*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Lucy
--
''
She
stretched
out
her
hand
.
``
I
seem
to
bring
nothing
*NL*
but
misfortune
wherever
I
go
.
''
Lucy
nodded
.
She
remembered
their
*NL*
last
evening
at
Florence
--
the
packing
,
the
candle
,
the
shadow
of
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
's
toque
on
the
door
.
She
was
not
to
be
trapped
by
pathos
a
*NL*
second
time
.
Eluding
her
cousin
's
caress
,
she
led
the
way
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
the
jam
,
''
Freddy
was
saying
.
``
The
jam
's
jolly
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
,
looking
big
and
dishevelled
,
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
*NL*
dining-room
.
As
she
entered
he
stopped
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
nothing
to
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
down
to
the
others
,
''
said
Lucy
;
``
Charlotte
and
I
will
give
Mr.
*NL*
Emerson
all
he
wants
.
Where
's
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
started
on
her
Sunday
writing

She
's
in
the
drawing-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
.
You
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
off
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
sat
down
at
the
table
.
Miss
Bartlett
,
who
was
thoroughly
*NL*
frightened
,
took
up
a
book
and
pretended
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
not
be
drawn
into
an
elaborate
speech
.
She
just
said
:
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
have
it
,
Mr.
Emerson
.
I
can
not
even
talk
to
you
.
Go
out
of
this
house
,
*NL*
and
never
come
into
it
again
as
long
as
I
live
here
--
''
flushing
as
she
*NL*
spoke
and
pointing
to
the
door
.
``
I
hate
a
row
.
Go
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
discussion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ca
n't
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
``
Go
,
please
.
I
do
not
want
to
call
in
Mr.
Vyse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
,
''
he
said
,
absolutely
ignoring
Miss
Bartlett
--
``
you
do
n't
*NL*
mean
that
you
are
going
to
marry
that
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
line
was
unexpected
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shrugged
her
shoulders
,
as
if
his
vulgarity
wearied
her
.
``
You
are
*NL*
merely
ridiculous
,
''
she
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
words
rose
gravely
over
hers
:
``
You
can
not
live
with
Vyse
.
He
's
*NL*
only
for
an
acquaintance
.
He
is
for
society
and
cultivated
talk
.
He
*NL*
should
know
no
one
intimately
,
least
of
all
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
new
light
on
Cecil
's
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
talked
to
Vyse
without
feeling
tired
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
scarcely
discuss
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
have
you
ever
?
He
is
the
sort
who
are
all
right
so
long
as
*NL*
they
keep
to
things
--
books
,
pictures
--
but
kill
when
they
come
to
*NL*
people
.
That
's
why
I
'll
speak
out
through
all
this
muddle
even
now
.
It
's
*NL*
shocking
enough
to
lose
you
in
any
case
,
but
generally
a
man
must
*NL*
deny
himself
joy
,
and
I
would
have
held
back
if
your
Cecil
had
been
a
*NL*
different
person
.
I
would
never
have
let
myself
go
.
But
I
saw
him
first
*NL*
in
the
National
Gallery
,
when
he
winced
because
my
father
mispronounced
*NL*
the
names
of
great
painters
.
Then
he
brings
us
here
,
and
we
find
it
*NL*
is
to
play
some
silly
trick
on
a
kind
neighbour
.
That
is
the
man
all
*NL*
over
--
playing
tricks
on
people
,
on
the
most
sacred
form
of
life
that
*NL*
he
can
find
.
Next
,
I
meet
you
together
,
and
find
him
protecting
and
*NL*
teaching
you
and
your
mother
to
be
shocked
,
when
it
was
for
YOU
to
*NL*
settle
whether
you
were
shocked
or
no
.
Cecil
all
over
again
.
He
dare
n't
*NL*
let
a
woman
decide
.
He
's
the
type
who
's
kept
Europe
back
for
a
thousand
*NL*
years
.
Every
moment
of
his
life
he
's
forming
you
,
telling
you
what
's
*NL*
charming
or
amusing
or
ladylike
,
telling
you
what
a
man
thinks
womanly
;
*NL*
and
you
,
you
of
all
women
,
listen
to
his
voice
instead
of
to
your
own
.
*NL*
So
it
was
at
the
Rectory
,
when
I
met
you
both
again
;
so
it
has
been
*NL*
the
whole
of
this
afternoon
.
Therefore
--
not
`
therefore
I
kissed
you
,
'
*NL*
because
the
book
made
me
do
that
,
and
I
wish
to
goodness
I
had
more
*NL*
self-control
.
I
'm
not
ashamed
.
I
do
n't
apologize
.
But
it
has
frightened
*NL*
you
,
and
you
may
not
have
noticed
that
I
love
you
.
Or
would
you
have
*NL*
told
me
to
go
,
and
dealt
with
a
tremendous
thing
so
lightly
?
But
*NL*
therefore
--
therefore
I
settled
to
fight
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
thought
of
a
very
good
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
Mr.
Vyse
wants
me
to
listen
to
him
,
Mr.
Emerson
.
Pardon
me
for
*NL*
suggesting
that
you
have
caught
the
habit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
took
the
shoddy
reproof
and
touched
it
into
immortality
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
,
''
and
sank
down
as
if
suddenly
weary
.
``
I
'm
the
same
kind
of
*NL*
brute
at
bottom
.
This
desire
to
govern
a
woman
--
it
lies
very
deep
,
and
*NL*
men
and
women
must
fight
it
together
before
they
shall
enter
the
garden
.
*NL*
But
I
do
love
you
surely
in
a
better
way
than
he
does
.
''
He
thought
.
*NL*
``
Yes
--
really
in
a
better
way
.
I
want
you
to
have
your
own
thoughts
even
*NL*
when
I
hold
you
in
my
arms
.
''
He
stretched
them
towards
her
.
``
Lucy
,
be
*NL*
quick
--
there
's
no
time
for
us
to
talk
now
--
come
to
me
as
you
came
in
the
*NL*
spring
,
and
afterwards
I
will
be
gentle
and
explain
.
I
have
cared
*NL*
for
you
since
that
man
died
.
I
can
not
live
without
you
,
`
No
good
,
'
I
*NL*
thought
;
`
she
is
marrying
someone
else
'
;
but
I
meet
you
again
when
all
*NL*
the
world
is
glorious
water
and
sun
.
As
you
came
through
the
wood
I
*NL*
saw
that
nothing
else
mattered
.
I
called
.
I
wanted
to
live
and
have
my
*NL*
chance
of
joy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mr.
Vyse
?
''
said
Lucy
,
who
kept
commendably
calm
.
``
Does
he
not
*NL*
matter
?
That
I
love
Cecil
and
shall
be
his
wife
shortly
?
A
detail
of
no
*NL*
importance
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
stretched
his
arms
over
the
table
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
what
you
intend
to
gain
by
this
exhibition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
:
``
It
is
our
last
chance
.
I
shall
do
all
that
I
can
.
''
And
as
*NL*
if
he
had
done
all
else
,
he
turned
to
Miss
Bartlett
,
who
sat
like
some
*NL*
portent
against
the
skies
of
the
evening
.
``
You
would
n't
stop
us
this
*NL*
second
time
if
you
understood
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
have
been
into
the
dark
,
and
*NL*
I
am
going
back
into
it
,
unless
you
will
try
to
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
long
,
narrow
head
drove
backwards
and
forwards
,
as
though
*NL*
demolishing
some
invisible
obstacle
.
She
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
being
young
,
''
he
said
quietly
,
picking
up
his
racquet
from
the
*NL*
floor
and
preparing
to
go
.
``
It
is
being
certain
that
Lucy
cares
for
me
*NL*
really
.
It
is
that
love
and
youth
matter
intellectually
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
silence
the
two
women
watched
him
.
His
last
remark
,
they
knew
,
was
*NL*
nonsense
,
but
was
he
going
after
it
or
not
?
Would
not
he
,
the
cad
,
*NL*
the
charlatan
,
attempt
a
more
dramatic
finish
?
No
.
He
was
apparently
*NL*
content
.
He
left
them
,
carefully
closing
the
front
door
;
and
when
they
*NL*
looked
through
the
hall
window
,
they
saw
him
go
up
the
drive
and
begin
*NL*
to
climb
the
slopes
of
withered
fern
behind
the
house
.
Their
tongues
*NL*
were
loosed
,
and
they
burst
into
stealthy
rejoicings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lucia
--
come
back
here
--
oh
,
what
an
awful
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
had
no
reaction
--
at
least
,
not
yet
.
``
Well
,
he
amuses
me
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
Either
I
'm
mad
,
or
else
he
is
,
and
I
'm
inclined
to
think
it
's
the
*NL*
latter
.
One
more
fuss
through
with
you
,
Charlotte
.
Many
thanks
.
I
think
,
*NL*
though
,
that
this
is
the
last
.
My
admirer
will
hardly
trouble
me
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Miss
Bartlett
,
too
,
essayed
the
roguish
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
n't
everyone
who
could
boast
such
a
conquest
,
dearest
,
is
*NL*
it
?
Oh
,
one
ought
n't
to
laugh
,
really
.
It
might
have
been
very
serious
.
*NL*
But
you
were
so
sensible
and
brave
--
so
unlike
the
girls
of
my
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
down
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
once
in
the
open
air
,
she
paused
.
Some
emotion
--
pity
,
terror
,
love
,
*NL*
but
the
emotion
was
strong
--
seized
her
,
and
she
was
aware
of
autumn
.
*NL*
Summer
was
ending
,
and
the
evening
brought
her
odours
of
decay
,
the
*NL*
more
pathetic
because
they
were
reminiscent
of
spring
.
That
something
or
*NL*
other
mattered
intellectually
?
A
leaf
,
violently
agitated
,
danced
past
*NL*
her
,
while
other
leaves
lay
motionless
.
That
the
earth
was
hastening
to
*NL*
re-enter
darkness
,
and
the
shadows
of
those
trees
over
Windy
Corner
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
,
Lucy
!
There
's
still
light
enough
for
another
set
,
if
you
two
'll
*NL*
hurry

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Emerson
has
had
to
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
nuisance
!
That
spoils
the
four

I

play

do

*NL*
there
's
a
good
chap

It
's
Floyd
's
last
day

Do
play
tennis
with
us

just
*NL*
this
once

''
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
's
voice
came
:
``
My
dear
Freddy
,
I
am
no
athlete
.
As
you
well
*NL*
remarked
this
very
morning
,
`
There
are
some
chaps
who
are
no
good
for
*NL*
anything
but
books

;
I
plead
guilty
to
being
such
a
chap

will
not
*NL*
inflict
myself
on
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scales
fell
from
Lucy
's
eyes
.
How
had
she
stood
Cecil
for
a
moment
?
*NL*
He
was
absolutely
intolerable
,
and
the
same
evening
she
broke
off
her
*NL*
engagement
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XVII
:
Lying
to
Cecil
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
bewildered
.
He
had
nothing
to
say
.
He
was
not
even
angry
,
but
*NL*
stood
,
with
a
glass
of
whiskey
between
his
hands
,
trying
to
think
what
*NL*
had
led
her
to
such
a
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
chosen
the
moment
before
bed
,
when
,
in
accordance
with
their
*NL*
bourgeois
habit
,
she
always
dispensed
drinks
to
the
men
.
Freddy
and
Mr.
*NL*
Floyd
were
sure
to
retire
with
their
glasses
,
while
Cecil
invariably
*NL*
lingered
,
sipping
at
his
while
she
locked
up
the
sideboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
about
it
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
have
carefully
thought
things
*NL*
over
.
We
are
too
different
.
I
must
ask
you
to
release
me
,
and
try
to
*NL*
forget
that
there
ever
was
such
a
foolish
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
suitable
speech
,
but
she
was
more
angry
than
sorry
,
and
her
*NL*
voice
showed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Different
--
how
--
how
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
had
a
really
good
education
,
for
one
thing
,
''
she
continued
,
*NL*
still
on
her
knees
by
the
sideboard
.
``
My
Italian
trip
came
too
late
,
and
*NL*
I
am
forgetting
all
that
I
learnt
there
.
I
shall
never
be
able
to
talk

to
your

behave
as

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

're
tired

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tired

she
retorted
,
kindling
at
once
.
``
That
is
exactly
like
you

You

always

*NL*

Well

*NL*
*NL*
``

It

saying
so
some
day

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
that
bad
headache
yesterday

All
right

for
she
had
exclaimed
*NL*
indignantly
:
``
I
see
it
's
much
more
than
headaches
.
But
give
me
a
*NL*
moment

time

He
closed
his
eyes
.
``
You
must
excuse
me
if
I
say
stupid
*NL*
things

but
my
brain
has
gone
to
pieces
.
Part
of
it
lives
three
minutes
*NL*
back
,
when
I
was
sure
that
you
loved
me
,
and
the
other
part
--
I
find
it
*NL*
difficult
--
I
am
likely
to
say
the
wrong
thing

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
struck
her
that
he
was
not
behaving
so
badly
,
and
her
irritation
*NL*
increased
.
She
again
desired
a
struggle
,
not
a
discussion
.
To
bring
on
*NL*
the
crisis
,
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
days
when
one
sees
clearly
,
and
this
is
one
of
them
.
Things
*NL*
must
come
to
a
breaking-point
some
time
,
and
it
happens
to
be
to-day
.
If
*NL*
you
want
to
know
,
quite
a
little
thing
decided
me
to
speak
to
you
--
when
*NL*
you
would
n't
play
tennis
with
Freddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
do
play
tennis
,
''
said
Cecil
,
painfully
bewildered
;
``
I
never
*NL*
could
play
.
I
do
n't
understand
a
word
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
play
well
enough
to
make
up
a
four
.
I
thought
it
abominably
*NL*
selfish
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
--
well
,
never
mind
the
tennis
.
Why
could
n't
you
--
could
n't
*NL*
you
have
warned
me
if
you
felt
anything
wrong
?
You
talked
of
our
wedding
*NL*
at
lunch
--
at
least
,
you
let
me
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
would
n't
understand
,
''
said
Lucy
quite
crossly
.
``
I
might
have
*NL*
known
there
would
have
been
these
dreadful
explanations
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
it
is
n't
the
tennis
--
that
was
only
the
last
straw
to
all
I
have
been
*NL*
feeling
for
weeks
.
Surely
it
was
better
not
to
speak
until
I
felt
*NL*
certain
.
''
She
developed
this
position
.
``
Often
before
I
have
wondered
if
*NL*
I
was
fitted
for
your
wife
--
for
instance
,
in
London
;
and
are
you
fitted
*NL*
to
be
my
husband
?
I
do
n't
think
so
.
You
do
n't
like
Freddy
,
nor
my
*NL*
mother
.
There
was
always
a
lot
against
our
engagement
,
Cecil
,
but
all
*NL*
our
relations
seemed
pleased
,
and
we
met
so
often
,
and
it
was
no
good
*NL*
mentioning
it
until
--
well
,
until
all
things
came
to
a
point
.
They
have
*NL*
to-day
.
I
see
clearly
.
I
must
speak
.
That
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
think
you
were
right
,
''
said
Cecil
gently
.
``
I
can
not
tell
*NL*
why
,
but
though
all
that
you
say
sounds
true
,
I
feel
that
you
are
not
*NL*
treating
me
fairly
.
It
's
all
too
horrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
good
of
a
scene
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
good
.
But
surely
I
have
a
right
to
hear
a
little
more
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
put
down
his
glass
and
opened
the
window
.
From
where
she
knelt
,
*NL*
jangling
her
keys
,
she
could
see
a
slit
of
darkness
,
and
,
peering
into
*NL*
it
,
as
if
it
would
tell
him
that
``
little
more
,
''
his
long
,
thoughtful
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
open
the
window
;
and
you
'd
better
draw
the
curtain
,
too
;
Freddy
*NL*
or
any
one
might
be
outside
.
''
He
obeyed
.
``
I
really
think
we
had
better
*NL*
go
to
bed
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
.
I
shall
only
say
things
that
will
make
me
*NL*
unhappy
afterwards
.
As
you
say
it
is
all
too
horrible
,
and
it
is
no
good
*NL*
talking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
Cecil
,
now
that
he
was
about
to
lose
her
,
she
seemed
each
moment
*NL*
more
desirable
.
He
looked
at
her
,
instead
of
through
her
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
since
they
were
engaged
.
From
a
Leonardo
she
had
become
a
living
*NL*
woman
,
with
mysteries
and
forces
of
her
own
,
with
qualities
that
even
*NL*
eluded
art
.
His
brain
recovered
from
the
shock
,
and
,
in
a
burst
of
*NL*
genuine
devotion
,
he
cried
:
``
But
I
love
you
,
and
I
did
think
you
loved
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
thought
I
did
at
first
.
I
am
sorry
,
and
ought
*NL*
to
have
refused
you
this
last
time
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
,
and
she
grew
more
and
more
vexed
*NL*
at
his
dignified
behaviour
.
She
had
counted
on
his
being
petty
.
It
would
*NL*
have
made
things
easier
for
her
.
By
a
cruel
irony
she
was
drawing
out
*NL*
all
that
was
finest
in
his
disposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
love
me
,
evidently
.
I
dare
say
you
are
right
not
to
.
But
it
*NL*
would
hurt
a
little
less
if
I
knew
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
''
--
a
phrase
came
to
her
,
and
she
accepted
it
--
``
you
're
the
sort
*NL*
who
ca
n't
know
any
one
intimately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
horrified
look
came
into
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
exactly
that
.
But
you
will
question
me
,
though
I
beg
you
*NL*
not
to
,
and
I
must
say
something
.
It
is
that
,
more
or
less
.
When
we
*NL*
were
only
acquaintances
,
you
let
me
be
myself
,
but
now
you
're
always
*NL*
protecting
me

''
Her
voice
swelled
.
``
I
wo
n't
be
protected
.
I
will
choose
*NL*
for
myself
what
is
ladylike
and
right

To
shield
me
is
an
insult
.
Ca
n't
*NL*
I
be
trusted
to
face
the
truth
but
I
must
get
it
second-hand
through
*NL*
you
?
A
woman
's
place
!
You
despise
my
mother
--
I
know
you
do
--
because
*NL*
she
's
conventional
and
bothers
over
puddings
;
but
,
oh
goodness
!
''
--
she
*NL*
rose
to
her
feet
--
``
conventional
,
Cecil
,
you
're
that
,
for
you
may
*NL*
understand
beautiful
things
,
but
you
do
n't
know
how
to
use
them
;
and
you
*NL*
wrap
yourself
up
in
art
and
books
and
music
,
and
would
try
to
wrap
up
*NL*
me
.
I
wo
n't
be
stifled
,
not
by
the
most
glorious
music
,
for
people
are
*NL*
more
glorious
,
and
you
hide
them
from
me
.
That
's
why
I
break
off
my
*NL*
engagement
.
You
were
all
right
as
long
as
you
kept
to
things
,
but
when
*NL*
you
came
to
people
--
''
She
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
.
Then
Cecil
said
with
great
emotion
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
on
the
whole

she
corrected
,
full
of
some
vague
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
every
word
.
It
is
a
revelation
.
It
is
--
I.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyhow
,
those
are
my
reasons
for
not
being
your
wife

*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
:
''
`
The
sort
that
can
know
no
one
intimately
.
'
It
is
true
.
I
*NL*
fell
to
pieces
the
very
first
day
we
were
engaged
.
I
behaved
like
a
cad
*NL*
to
Beebe
and
to
your
brother
.
You
are
even
greater
than
I
thought
.
''
She
*NL*
withdrew
a
step
.
``
I
'm
not
going
to
worry
you
.
You
are
far
too
good
to
*NL*
me
.
I
shall
never
forget
your
insight
;
and
,
dear
,
I
only
blame
you
for
*NL*
this
:
you
might
have
warned
me
in
the
early
stages
,
before
you
felt
*NL*
you
would
n't
marry
me
,
and
so
have
given
me
a
chance
to
improve
.
I
have
*NL*
never
known
you
till
this
evening
.
I
have
just
used
you
as
a
peg
for
*NL*
my
silly
notions
of
what
a
woman
should
be
.
But
this
evening
you
are
a
*NL*
different
person
:
new
thoughts
--
even
a
new
voice
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
a
new
voice
?
''
she
asked
,
seized
with
incontrollable
*NL*
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
a
new
person
seems
speaking
through
you
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
lost
her
balance
.
She
cried
:
``
If
you
think
I
am
in
love
with
*NL*
someone
else
,
you
are
very
much
mistaken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
n't
think
that
.
You
are
not
that
kind
,
Lucy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
you
do
think
it
.
It
's
your
old
idea
,
the
idea
that
has
kept
*NL*
Europe
back
--
I
mean
the
idea
that
women
are
always
thinking
of
men
.
If
*NL*
a
girl
breaks
off
her
engagement
,
everyone
says
:
`
Oh
,
she
had
some
*NL*
one
else
in
her
mind
;
she
hopes
to
get
someone
else
.
'
It
's
disgusting
,
*NL*
brutal
!
As
if
a
girl
ca
n't
break
it
off
for
the
sake
of
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
reverently
:
``
I
may
have
said
that
in
the
past
.
I
shall
never
*NL*
say
it
again
.
You
have
taught
me
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
redden
,
and
pretended
to
examine
the
windows
again
.
``
Of
*NL*
course
,
there
is
no
question
of
`
someone
else
'
in
this
,
no
`
jilting
'
or
*NL*
any
such
nauseous
stupidity
.
I
beg
your
pardon
most
humbly
if
my
words
*NL*
suggested
that
there
was
.
I
only
meant
that
there
was
a
force
in
you
*NL*
that
I
had
n't
known
of
up
till
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
Cecil
,
that
will
do
.
Do
n't
apologize
to
me
.
It
was
my
*NL*
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
question
between
ideals
,
yours
and
mine
--
pure
abstract
ideals
,
*NL*
and
yours
are
the
nobler
.
I
was
bound
up
in
the
old
vicious
notions
,
*NL*
and
all
the
time
you
were
splendid
and
new
.
''
His
voice
broke
.
``
I
must
*NL*
actually
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
--
for
showing
me
what
I
really
*NL*
am
.
Solemnly
,
I
thank
you
for
showing
me
a
true
woman
.
Will
you
shake
*NL*
hands
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
will
,
''
said
Lucy
,
twisting
up
her
other
hand
in
the
*NL*
curtains
.
``
Good-night
,
Cecil
.
Good-bye
.
That
's
all
right
.
I
'm
sorry
*NL*
about
it
.
Thank
you
very
much
for
your
gentleness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
light
your
candle
,
shall
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
into
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
Good-night
again
.
God
bless
you
,
Lucy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Cecil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
watched
him
steal
up-stairs
,
while
the
shadows
from
three
banisters
*NL*
passed
over
her
face
like
the
beat
of
wings
.
On
the
landing
he
paused
*NL*
strong
in
his
renunciation
,
and
gave
her
a
look
of
memorable
beauty
.
For
*NL*
all
his
culture
,
Cecil
was
an
ascetic
at
heart
,
and
nothing
in
his
love
*NL*
became
him
like
the
leaving
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
never
marry
.
In
the
tumult
of
her
soul
,
that
stood
firm
.
Cecil
*NL*
believed
in
her
;
she
must
some
day
believe
in
herself
.
She
must
be
one
*NL*
of
the
women
whom
she
had
praised
so
eloquently
,
who
care
for
liberty
*NL*
and
not
for
men
;
she
must
forget
that
George
loved
her
,
that
George
had
*NL*
been
thinking
through
her
and
gained
her
this
honourable
release
,
that
*NL*
George
had
gone
away
into
--
what
was
it
?
--
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
out
the
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
do
to
think
,
nor
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
to
feel
.
She
gave
up
*NL*
trying
to
understand
herself
,
and
joined
the
vast
armies
of
the
benighted
,
who
*NL*
follow
neither
the
heart
nor
the
brain
,
and
march
to
their
destiny
by
*NL*
catch-words
.
The
armies
are
full
of
pleasant
and
pious
folk
.
But
they
*NL*
have
yielded
to
the
only
enemy
that
matters
--
the
enemy
within
.
They
have
*NL*
sinned
against
passion
and
truth
,
and
vain
will
be
their
strife
after
*NL*
virtue
.
As
the
years
pass
,
they
are
censured
.
Their
pleasantry
and
*NL*
their
piety
show
cracks
,
their
wit
becomes
cynicism
,
their
unselfishness
*NL*
hypocrisy
;
they
feel
and
produce
discomfort
wherever
they
go
.
They
have
*NL*
sinned
against
Eros
and
against
Pallas
Athene
,
and
not
by
any
heavenly
*NL*
intervention
,
but
by
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
,
those
allied
deities
*NL*
will
be
avenged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
entered
this
army
when
she
pretended
to
George
that
she
did
not
*NL*
love
him
,
and
pretended
to
Cecil
that
she
loved
no
one
.
The
night
*NL*
received
her
,
as
it
had
received
Miss
Bartlett
thirty
years
before

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XVIII
:
Lying
to
Mr.
Beebe
,
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
Freddy
,
and
The
*NL*
Servants
*NL*
*NL*
Windy
Corner
lay
,
not
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
,
but
a
few
hundred
feet
*NL*
down
the
southern
slope
,
at
the
springing
of
one
of
the
great
buttresses
*NL*
that
supported
the
hill
.
On
either
side
of
it
was
a
shallow
ravine
,
*NL*
filled
with
ferns
and
pine-trees
,
and
down
the
ravine
on
the
left
ran
*NL*
the
highway
into
the
Weald
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
Mr.
Beebe
crossed
the
ridge
and
caught
sight
of
these
noble
*NL*
dispositions
of
the
earth
,
and
,
poised
in
the
middle
of
them
,
Windy
*NL*
Corner
,
--
he
laughed
.
The
situation
was
so
glorious
,
the
house
so
*NL*
commonplace
,
not
to
say
impertinent
.
The
late
Mr.
Honeychurch
had
*NL*
affected
the
cube
,
because
it
gave
him
the
most
accommodation
for
his
*NL*
money
,
and
the
only
addition
made
by
his
widow
had
been
a
small
turret
,
*NL*
shaped
like
a
rhinoceros
'
horn
,
where
she
could
sit
in
wet
weather
and
*NL*
watch
the
carts
going
up
and
down
the
road
.
So
impertinent
--
and
yet
the
*NL*
house
``
did
,
''
for
it
was
the
home
of
people
who
loved
their
surroundings
*NL*
honestly
.
Other
houses
in
the
neighborhood
had
been
built
by
expensive
*NL*
architects
,
over
others
their
inmates
had
fidgeted
sedulously
,
yet
all
*NL*
these
suggested
the
accidental
,
the
temporary
;
while
Windy
Corner
seemed
*NL*
as
inevitable
as
an
ugliness
of
Nature
's
own
creation
.
One
might
laugh
*NL*
at
the
house
,
but
one
never
shuddered
.
Mr.
Beebe
was
bicycling
over
*NL*
this
Monday
afternoon
with
a
piece
of
gossip
.
He
had
heard
from
the
Miss
*NL*
Alans
.
These
admirable
ladies
,
since
they
could
not
go
to
Cissie
Villa
,
*NL*
had
changed
their
plans
.
They
were
going
to
Greece
instead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
Florence
did
my
poor
sister
so
much
good
,
''
wrote
Miss
Catharine
,
*NL*
``
we
do
not
see
why
we
should
not
try
Athens
this
winter
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
Athens
is
a
plunge
,
and
the
doctor
has
ordered
her
special
digestive
*NL*
bread
;
but
,
after
all
,
we
can
take
that
with
us
,
and
it
is
only
getting
*NL*
first
into
a
steamer
and
then
into
a
train
.
But
is
there
an
English
*NL*
Church
?
''
And
the
letter
went
on
to
say
:
``
I
do
not
expect
we
shall
go
any
*NL*
further
than
Athens
,
but
if
you
knew
of
a
really
comfortable
pension
at
*NL*
Constantinople
,
we
should
be
so
grateful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
would
enjoy
this
letter
,
and
the
smile
with
which
Mr.
Beebe
greeted
*NL*
Windy
Corner
was
partly
for
her
.
She
would
see
the
fun
of
it
,
and
some
*NL*
of
its
beauty
,
for
she
must
see
some
beauty
.
Though
she
was
hopeless
*NL*
about
pictures
,
and
though
she
dressed
so
unevenly
--
oh
,
that
cerise
*NL*
frock
yesterday
at
church
!
--
she
must
see
some
beauty
in
life
,
or
she
*NL*
could
not
play
the
piano
as
she
did
.
He
had
a
theory
that
musicians
are
*NL*
incredibly
complex
,
and
know
far
less
than
other
artists
what
they
want
*NL*
and
what
they
are
;
that
they
puzzle
themselves
as
well
as
their
friends
;
*NL*
that
their
psychology
is
a
modern
development
,
and
has
not
yet
been
*NL*
understood
.
This
theory
,
had
he
known
it
,
had
possibly
just
been
*NL*
illustrated
by
facts
.
Ignorant
of
the
events
of
yesterday
he
was
only
*NL*
riding
over
to
get
some
tea
,
to
see
his
niece
,
and
to
observe
whether
*NL*
Miss
Honeychurch
saw
anything
beautiful
in
the
desire
of
two
old
ladies
*NL*
to
visit
Athens
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
carriage
was
drawn
up
outside
Windy
Corner
,
and
just
as
he
caught
*NL*
sight
of
the
house
it
started
,
bowled
up
the
drive
,
and
stopped
abruptly
*NL*
when
it
reached
the
main
road
.
Therefore
it
must
be
the
horse
,
who
*NL*
always
expected
people
to
walk
up
the
hill
in
case
they
tired
him
.
The
*NL*
door
opened
obediently
,
and
two
men
emerged
,
whom
Mr.
Beebe
recognized
*NL*
as
Cecil
and
Freddy
.
They
were
an
odd
couple
to
go
driving
;
but
he
saw
*NL*
a
trunk
beside
the
coachman
's
legs
.
Cecil
,
who
wore
a
bowler
,
must
be
*NL*
going
away
,
while
Freddy
-LRB-
a
cap
-RRB-
--
was
seeing
him
to
the
station
.
They
*NL*
walked
rapidly
,
taking
the
short
cuts
,
and
reached
the
summit
while
the
*NL*
carriage
was
still
pursuing
the
windings
of
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
shook
hands
with
the
clergyman
,
but
did
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
're
off
for
a
minute
,
Mr.
Vyse
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
said
,
``
Yes
,
''
while
Freddy
edged
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
coming
to
show
you
this
delightful
letter
from
those
friends
*NL*
of
Miss
Honeychurch
.
''
He
quoted
from
it
.
``
Is
n't
it
wonderful
?
Is
n't
it
*NL*
romance
?
Most
certainly
they
will
go
to
Constantinople
.
They
are
taken
*NL*
in
a
snare
that
can
not
fail
.
They
will
end
by
going
round
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cecil
listened
civilly
,
and
said
he
was
sure
that
Lucy
would
be
amused
*NL*
and
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
Romance
capricious
!
I
never
notice
it
in
you
young
people
;
you
*NL*
do
nothing
but
play
lawn
tennis
,
and
say
that
romance
is
dead
,
while
the
*NL*
Miss
Alans
are
struggling
with
all
the
weapons
of
propriety
against
the
*NL*
terrible
thing
.
'
A
really
comfortable
pension
at
Constantinople
!
'
So
*NL*
they
call
it
out
of
decency
,
but
in
their
hearts
they
want
a
pension
*NL*
with
magic
windows
opening
on
the
foam
of
perilous
seas
in
fairyland
*NL*
forlorn
!
No
ordinary
view
will
content
the
Miss
Alans
.
They
want
the
*NL*
Pension
Keats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
awfully
sorry
to
interrupt
,
Mr.
Beebe
,
''
said
Freddy
,
``
but
have
you
*NL*
any
matches
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
''
said
Cecil
,
and
it
did
not
escape
Mr.
Beebe
's
notice
that
he
*NL*
spoke
to
the
boy
more
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
never
met
these
Miss
Alans
,
have
you
,
Mr.
Vyse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
n't
see
the
wonder
of
this
Greek
visit
.
I
have
n't
been
*NL*
to
Greece
myself
,
and
do
n't
mean
to
go
,
and
I
ca
n't
imagine
any
of
my
*NL*
friends
going
.
It
is
altogether
too
big
for
our
little
lot
.
Do
n't
you
*NL*
think
so
?
Italy
is
just
about
as
much
as
we
can
manage
.
Italy
is
heroic
,
*NL*
but
Greece
is
godlike
or
devilish
--
I
am
not
sure
which
,
and
in
either
*NL*
case
absolutely
out
of
our
suburban
focus
.
All
right
,
Freddy
--
I
am
*NL*
not
being
clever
,
upon
my
word
I
am
not
--
I
took
the
idea
from
another
*NL*
fellow
;
and
give
me
those
matches
when
you
've
done
with
them
.
''
He
lit
a
*NL*
cigarette
,
and
went
on
talking
to
the
two
young
men
.
``
I
was
saying
,
if
*NL*
our
poor
little
Cockney
lives
must
have
a
background
,
let
it
be
Italian
.
*NL*
Big
enough
in
all
conscience
.
The
ceiling
of
the
Sistine
Chapel
for
*NL*
me
.
There
the
contrast
is
just
as
much
as
I
can
realize
.
But
not
the
*NL*
Parthenon
,
not
the
frieze
of
Phidias
at
any
price
;
and
here
comes
the
*NL*
victoria
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
quite
right
,
''
said
Cecil
.
``
Greece
is
not
for
our
little
lot
''
;
*NL*
and
he
got
in
.
Freddy
followed
,
nodding
to
the
clergyman
,
whom
he
*NL*
trusted
not
to
be
pulling
one
's
leg
,
really
.
And
before
they
had
gone
a
*NL*
dozen
yards
he
jumped
out
,
and
came
running
back
for
Vyse
's
match-box
,
*NL*
which
had
not
been
returned
.
As
he
took
it
,
he
said
:
``
I
'm
so
glad
you
*NL*
only
talked
about
books
.
Cecil
's
hard
hit
.
Lucy
wo
n't
marry
him
.
If
*NL*
you
'd
gone
on
about
her
,
as
you
did
about
them
,
he
might
have
broken
*NL*
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Late
last
night
.
I
must
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
they
wo
n't
want
me
down
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
go
on
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
goodness
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Beebe
to
himself
,
and
struck
the
saddle
*NL*
of
his
bicycle
approvingly
,
``
It
was
the
one
foolish
thing
she
ever
*NL*
did
.
Oh
,
what
a
glorious
riddance
!
''
And
,
after
a
little
thought
,
he
*NL*
negotiated
the
slope
into
Windy
Corner
,
light
of
heart
.
The
house
was
*NL*
again
as
it
ought
to
be
--
cut
off
forever
from
Cecil
's
pretentious
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
find
Miss
Minnie
down
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
drawing-room
Lucy
was
tinkling
at
a
Mozart
Sonata
.
He
hesitated
a
*NL*
moment
,
but
went
down
the
garden
as
requested
.
There
he
found
a
mournful
*NL*
company
.
It
was
a
blustering
day
,
and
the
wind
had
taken
and
broken
the
*NL*
dahlias
.
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
who
looked
cross
,
was
tying
them
up
,
*NL*
while
Miss
Bartlett
,
unsuitably
dressed
,
impeded
her
with
offers
of
*NL*
assistance
.
At
a
little
distance
stood
Minnie
and
the
``
garden-child
,
''
a
*NL*
minute
importation
,
each
holding
either
end
of
a
long
piece
of
bass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Beebe
?
Gracious
what
a
mess
everything
is
!
Look
*NL*
at
my
scarlet
pompoms
,
and
the
wind
blowing
your
skirts
about
,
and
the
*NL*
ground
so
hard
that
not
a
prop
will
stick
in
,
and
then
the
carriage
*NL*
having
to
go
out
,
when
I
had
counted
on
having
Powell
,
who
--
give
every
*NL*
one
their
due
--
does
tie
up
dahlias
properly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evidently
Mrs.
Honeychurch
was
shattered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
?
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
,
with
a
meaning
glance
,
as
though
*NL*
conveying
that
more
than
dahlias
had
been
broken
off
by
the
autumn
*NL*
gales
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Lennie
,
the
bass
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Honeychurch
.
The
garden-child
,
who
*NL*
did
not
know
what
bass
was
,
stood
rooted
to
the
path
with
horror
.
Minnie
*NL*
slipped
to
her
uncle
and
whispered
that
everyone
was
very
disagreeable
*NL*
to-day
,
and
that
it
was
not
her
fault
if
dahlia-strings
would
tear
*NL*
longways
instead
of
across
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
for
a
walk
with
me
,
''
he
told
her
.
``
You
have
worried
them
as
much
*NL*
as
they
can
stand
.
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
I
only
called
in
aimlessly
.
I
shall
*NL*
take
her
up
to
tea
at
the
Beehive
Tavern
,
if
I
may
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
must
you
?
Yes
do
.
--
Not
the
scissors
,
thank
you
,
Charlotte
,
when
*NL*
both
my
hands
are
full
already
--
I
'm
perfectly
certain
that
the
orange
*NL*
cactus
will
go
before
I
can
get
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
,
who
was
an
adept
at
relieving
situations
,
invited
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
to
accompany
them
to
this
mild
festivity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Charlotte
,
I
do
n't
want
you
--
do
go
;
there
's
nothing
to
stop
about
*NL*
for
,
either
in
the
house
or
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
said
that
her
duty
lay
in
the
dahlia
bed
,
but
when
she
had
*NL*
exasperated
everyone
,
except
Minnie
,
by
a
refusal
,
she
turned
round
and
*NL*
exasperated
Minnie
by
an
acceptance
.
As
they
walked
up
the
garden
,
the
*NL*
orange
cactus
fell
,
and
Mr.
Beebe
's
last
vision
was
of
the
garden-child
*NL*
clasping
it
like
a
lover
,
his
dark
head
buried
in
a
wealth
of
blossom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
terrible
,
this
havoc
among
the
flowers
,
''
he
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
always
terrible
when
the
promise
of
months
is
destroyed
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
''
enunciated
Miss
Bartlett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
we
ought
to
send
Miss
Honeychurch
down
to
her
mother
.
Or
will
*NL*
she
come
with
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
we
had
better
leave
Lucy
to
herself
,
and
to
her
own
pursuits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
angry
with
Miss
Honeychurch
because
she
was
late
for
*NL*
breakfast
,
''
whispered
Minnie
,
``
and
Floyd
has
gone
,
and
Mr.
Vyse
has
*NL*
gone
,
and
Freddy
wo
n't
play
with
me
.
In
fact
,
Uncle
Arthur
,
the
house
is
*NL*
not
AT
ALL
what
it
was
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
a
prig
,
''
said
her
Uncle
Arthur
.
``
Go
and
put
on
your
boots
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
into
the
drawing-room
,
where
Lucy
was
still
attentively
*NL*
pursuing
the
Sonatas
of
Mozart
.
She
stopped
when
he
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
?
Miss
Bartlett
and
Minnie
are
coming
with
me
to
tea
at
*NL*
the
Beehive
.
Would
you
come
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
will
,
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
suppose
you
would
care
to
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
turned
to
the
piano
and
struck
a
few
chords
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
delicate
those
Sonatas
are
!
''
said
Mr.
Beebe
,
though
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
his
heart
,
he
thought
them
silly
little
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
passed
into
Schumann
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Honeychurch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
them
on
the
hill
.
Your
brother
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
he
did
?
''
She
sounded
annoyed
.
Mr.
Beebe
felt
hurt
,
for
he
had
*NL*
thought
that
she
would
like
him
to
be
told
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
n't
say
that
it
will
go
no
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
Charlotte
,
Cecil
,
Freddy
,
you
,
''
said
Lucy
,
playing
a
note
for
*NL*
each
person
who
knew
,
and
then
playing
a
sixth
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'll
let
me
say
so
,
I
am
very
glad
,
and
I
am
certain
that
you
have
*NL*
done
the
right
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
hoped
other
people
would
think
,
but
they
do
n't
seem
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
see
that
Miss
Bartlett
thought
it
unwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
does
mother
.
Mother
minds
dreadfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
for
that
,
''
said
Mr.
Beebe
with
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
who
hated
all
changes
,
did
mind
,
but
not
nearly
as
*NL*
much
as
her
daughter
pretended
,
and
only
for
the
minute
.
It
was
really
*NL*
a
ruse
of
Lucy
's
to
justify
her
despondency
--
a
ruse
of
which
she
was
not
*NL*
herself
conscious
,
for
she
was
marching
in
the
armies
of
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Freddy
minds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
Freddy
never
hit
it
off
with
Vyse
much
,
did
he
?
I
gathered
that
*NL*
he
disliked
the
engagement
,
and
felt
it
might
separate
him
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boys
are
so
odd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
could
be
heard
arguing
with
Miss
Bartlett
through
the
floor
.
Tea
*NL*
at
the
Beehive
apparently
involved
a
complete
change
of
apparel
.
Mr.
*NL*
Beebe
saw
that
Lucy
--
very
properly
--
did
not
wish
to
discuss
her
action
,
*NL*
so
after
a
sincere
expression
of
sympathy
,
he
said
,
``
I
have
had
an
*NL*
absurd
letter
from
Miss
Alan
.
That
was
really
what
brought
me
over
.
I
*NL*
thought
it
might
amuse
you
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
delightful
!
''
said
Lucy
,
in
a
dull
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
sake
of
something
to
do
,
he
began
to
read
her
the
letter
.
After
*NL*
a
few
words
her
eyes
grew
alert
,
and
soon
she
interrupted
him
with
*NL*
``
Going
abroad
?
When
do
they
start
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
week
,
I
gather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Freddy
say
whether
he
was
driving
straight
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
did
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
hope
he
wo
n't
go
gossiping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
did
want
to
talk
about
her
broken
engagement
.
Always
complaisant
,
*NL*
he
put
the
letter
away
.
But
she
,
at
once
exclaimed
in
a
high
voice
,
``
Oh
,
*NL*
do
tell
me
more
about
the
Miss
Alans
!
How
perfectly
splendid
of
them
to
*NL*
go
abroad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
them
to
start
from
Venice
,
and
go
in
a
cargo
steamer
down
the
*NL*
Illyrian
coast
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
heartily
.
``
Oh
,
delightful
!
I
wish
they
'd
take
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Italy
filled
you
with
the
fever
of
travel
?
Perhaps
George
Emerson
*NL*
is
right
.
He
says
that
`
Italy
is
only
an
euphuism
for
Fate
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
Italy
,
but
Constantinople
.
I
have
always
longed
to
go
to
*NL*
Constantinople
.
Constantinople
is
practically
Asia
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
reminded
her
that
Constantinople
was
still
unlikely
,
and
that
*NL*
the
Miss
Alans
only
aimed
at
Athens
,
``
with
Delphi
,
perhaps
,
if
the
roads
*NL*
are
safe
.
''
But
this
made
no
difference
to
her
enthusiasm
.
She
had
always
*NL*
longed
to
go
to
Greece
even
more
,
it
seemed
.
He
saw
,
to
his
surprise
,
*NL*
that
she
was
apparently
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
realize
that
you
and
the
Miss
Alans
were
still
such
friends
,
*NL*
after
Cissie
Villa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
nothing
;
I
assure
you
Cissie
Villa
's
nothing
to
me
;
I
would
*NL*
give
anything
to
go
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
your
mother
spare
you
again
so
soon
?
You
have
scarcely
been
home
*NL*
three
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
MUST
spare
me
!
''
cried
Lucy
,
in
growing
excitement
.
``
I
simply
MUST
*NL*
go
away
.
I
have
to
.
''
She
ran
her
fingers
hysterically
through
her
hair
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
see
that
I
HAVE
to
go
away
?
I
did
n't
realize
at
the
time
--
and
*NL*
of
course
I
want
to
see
Constantinople
so
particularly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
since
you
have
broken
off
your
engagement
you
feel
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
I
knew
you
'd
understand

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
did
not
quite
understand
.
Why
could
not
Miss
Honeychurch
*NL*
repose
in
the
bosom
of
her
family
?
Cecil
had
evidently
taken
up
the
*NL*
dignified
line
,
and
was
not
going
to
annoy
her
.
Then
it
struck
him
that
*NL*
her
family
itself
might
be
annoying
.
He
hinted
this
to
her
,
and
she
*NL*
accepted
the
hint
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
;
to
go
to
Constantinople
until
they
are
used
to
the
idea
*NL*
and
everything
has
calmed
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
it
has
been
a
bothersome
business
,
''
he
said
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
at
all

Cecil
was
very
kind
indeed
;
only
--
I
had
better
tell
*NL*
you
the
whole
truth
,
since
you
have
heard
a
little
--
it
was
that
he
is
*NL*
so
masterful
.
I
found
that
he
would
n't
let
me
go
my
own
way
.
He
would
*NL*
improve
me
in
places
where
I
ca
n't
be
improved
.
Cecil
wo
n't
let
a
woman
*NL*
decide
for
herself
--
in
fact
,
he
dare
n't
.
What
nonsense
I
do
talk
!
But
*NL*
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
what
I
gathered
from
my
own
observation
of
Mr.
Vyse
;
it
is
what
I
*NL*
gather
from
all
that
I
have
known
of
you
.
I
do
sympathize
and
agree
*NL*
most
profoundly
.
I
agree
so
much
that
you
must
let
me
make
one
little
*NL*
criticism
:
Is
it
worth
while
rushing
off
to
Greece
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
go
somewhere
!

she
cried
.
``
I
have
been
worrying
all
the
*NL*
morning
,
and
here
comes
the
very
thing
.
''
She
struck
her
knees
with
*NL*
clenched
fists
,
and
repeated
:
``
I
must
!
And
the
time
I
shall
have
with
*NL*
mother
,
and
all
the
money
she
spent
on
me
last
spring
.
You
all
think
*NL*
much
too
highly
of
me

I
wish
you
were
n't
so
kind

''
At
this
moment
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
entered
,
and
her
nervousness
increased
.
``
I
must
get
away
,
ever
*NL*
so
far

I
must
know
my
own
mind

where
I
want
to
go

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along

tea
,
tea
,
tea

said
Mr.
Beebe
,
and
bustled
his
guests
out
*NL*
of
the
front-door
.
He
hustled
them
so
quickly
that
he
forgot
his
hat
.
*NL*
When
he
returned
for
it
he
heard
,
to
his
relief
and
surprise
,
the
*NL*
tinkling
of
a
Mozart
Sonata
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
playing
again

''
he
said
to
Miss
Bartlett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
can
always
play

was
the
acid
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
is
very
thankful

she
ought
to
be
.
I
know
all
about
it
.
The
*NL*
marriage
was
so
near
that
it
must
have
been
a
hard
struggle
before
she
*NL*
could
wind
herself
up
to
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
gave
a
kind
of
wriggle
,
and
he
prepared
for
a
discussion
.
*NL*
He
had
never
fathomed
Miss
Bartlett
.
As
he
had
put
it
to
himself
*NL*
at
Florence
,
``
she
might
yet
reveal
depths
of
strangeness
,
if
not
of
*NL*
meaning
.
''
But
she
was
so
unsympathetic
that
she
must
be
reliable
.
He
*NL*
assumed
that
much
,
and
he
had
no
hesitation
in
discussing
Lucy
with
her
.
*NL*
Minnie
was
fortunately
collecting
ferns
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
the
discussion
with
:
``
We
had
much
better
let
the
matter
*NL*
drop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
of
the
highest
importance
that
there
should
be
no
gossip
in
*NL*
Summer
Street
.
It
would
be
DEATH
to
gossip
about
Mr.
Vyse
's
dismissal
at
*NL*
the
present
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
raised
his
eyebrows
.
Death
is
a
strong
word
--
surely
too
*NL*
strong
.
There
was
no
question
of
tragedy
.
He
said
:
``
Of
course
,
Miss
*NL*
Honeychurch
will
make
the
fact
public
in
her
own
way
,
and
when
she
*NL*
chooses
.
Freddy
only
told
me
because
he
knew
she
would
not
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
said
Miss
Bartlett
civilly
.
``
Yet
Freddy
ought
not
to
have
told
*NL*
even
you
.
One
can
not
be
too
careful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
implore
absolute
secrecy
.
A
chance
word
to
a
chattering
friend
,
*NL*
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
''
He
was
used
to
these
nervous
old
maids
and
to
the
exaggerated
*NL*
importance
that
they
attach
to
words
.
A
rector
lives
in
a
web
of
petty
*NL*
secrets
,
and
confidences
and
warnings
,
and
the
wiser
he
is
the
less
he
*NL*
will
regard
them
.
He
will
change
the
subject
,
as
did
Mr.
Beebe
,
saying
*NL*
cheerfully
:
``
Have
you
heard
from
any
Bertolini
people
lately
?
I
believe
*NL*
you
keep
up
with
Miss
Lavish
.
It
is
odd
how
we
of
that
pension
,
*NL*
who
seemed
such
a
fortuitous
collection
,
have
been
working
into
one
*NL*
another
's
lives
.
Two
,
three
,
four
,
six
of
us
--
no
,
eight
;
I
had
forgotten
*NL*
the
Emersons
--
have
kept
more
or
less
in
touch
.
We
must
really
give
the
*NL*
Signora
a
testimonial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
Miss
Bartlett
not
favouring
the
scheme
,
they
walked
up
the
hill
in
*NL*
a
silence
which
was
only
broken
by
the
rector
naming
some
fern
.
On
the
*NL*
summit
they
paused
.
The
sky
had
grown
wilder
since
he
stood
there
last
*NL*
hour
,
giving
to
the
land
a
tragic
greatness
that
is
rare
in
Surrey
.
*NL*
Grey
clouds
were
charging
across
tissues
of
white
,
which
stretched
and
*NL*
shredded
and
tore
slowly
,
until
through
their
final
layers
there
gleamed
*NL*
a
hint
of
the
disappearing
blue
.
Summer
was
retreating
.
The
wind
roared
,
*NL*
the
trees
groaned
,
yet
the
noise
seemed
insufficient
for
those
vast
*NL*
operations
in
heaven
.
The
weather
was
breaking
up
,
breaking
,
broken
,
*NL*
and
it
is
a
sense
of
the
fit
rather
than
of
the
supernatural
that
equips
*NL*
such
crises
with
the
salvos
of
angelic
artillery
.
Mr.
Beebe
's
eyes
*NL*
rested
on
Windy
Corner
,
where
Lucy
sat
,
practising
Mozart
.
No
smile
came
*NL*
to
his
lips
,
and
,
changing
the
subject
again
,
he
said
:
``
We
sha
n't
have
*NL*
rain
,
but
we
shall
have
darkness
,
so
let
us
hurry
on
.
The
darkness
last
*NL*
night
was
appalling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
the
Beehive
Tavern
at
about
five
o'clock
.
That
amiable
*NL*
hostelry
possesses
a
verandah
,
in
which
the
young
and
the
unwise
do
*NL*
dearly
love
to
sit
,
while
guests
of
more
mature
years
seek
a
pleasant
*NL*
sanded
room
,
and
have
tea
at
a
table
comfortably
.
Mr.
Beebe
saw
that
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
would
be
cold
if
she
sat
out
,
and
that
Minnie
would
be
*NL*
dull
if
she
sat
in
,
so
he
proposed
a
division
of
forces
.
They
would
hand
*NL*
the
child
her
food
through
the
window
.
Thus
he
was
incidentally
enabled
*NL*
to
discuss
the
fortunes
of
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
,
Miss
Bartlett
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
,
unless
you
*NL*
very
much
object
,
I
would
like
to
reopen
that
discussion
.
''
She
bowed
.
*NL*
``
Nothing
about
the
past
.
I
know
little
and
care
less
about
that
;
I
am
*NL*
absolutely
certain
that
it
is
to
your
cousin
's
credit
.
She
has
acted
*NL*
loftily
and
rightly
,
and
it
is
like
her
gentle
modesty
to
say
that
we
*NL*
think
too
highly
of
her
.
But
the
future
.
Seriously
,
what
do
you
think
of
*NL*
this
Greek
plan
?
''
He
pulled
out
the
letter
again
.
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
*NL*
you
overheard
,
but
she
wants
to
join
the
Miss
Alans
in
their
mad
career
.
*NL*
It
's
all
--
I
ca
n't
explain
--
it
's
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
read
the
letter
in
silence
,
laid
it
down
,
seemed
to
*NL*
hesitate
,
and
then
read
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
see
the
point
of
it
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
his
astonishment
,
she
replied
:
``
There
I
can
not
agree
with
you
.
In
it
*NL*
I
spy
Lucy
's
salvation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
.
Now
,
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wanted
to
leave
Windy
Corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
--
but
it
seems
so
odd
,
so
unlike
her
,
so
--
I
was
going
to
*NL*
say
--
selfish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
natural
,
surely
--
after
such
painful
scenes
--
that
she
should
*NL*
desire
a
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
apparently
,
was
one
of
those
points
that
the
male
intellect
*NL*
misses
.
Mr.
Beebe
exclaimed
:
``
So
she
says
herself
,
and
since
another
*NL*
lady
agrees
with
her
,
I
must
own
that
I
am
partially
convinced
.
Perhaps
*NL*
she
must
have
a
change
.
I
have
no
sisters
or
--
and
I
do
n't
understand
*NL*
these
things
.
But
why
need
she
go
as
far
as
Greece
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
well
ask
that
,
''
replied
Miss
Bartlett
,
who
was
evidently
*NL*
interested
,
and
had
almost
dropped
her
evasive
manner
.
``
Why
Greece
?
*NL*
-LRB-
What
is
it
,
Minnie
dear
--
jam
?
-RRB-
Why
not
Tunbridge
Wells
?
Oh
,
Mr.
Beebe
!
*NL*
I
had
a
long
and
most
unsatisfactory
interview
with
dear
Lucy
this
*NL*
morning
.
I
can
not
help
her
.
I
will
say
no
more
.
Perhaps
I
have
already
*NL*
said
too
much
.
I
am
not
to
talk
.
I
wanted
her
to
spend
six
months
with
*NL*
me
at
Tunbridge
Wells
,
and
she
refused
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
poked
at
a
crumb
with
his
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
feelings
are
of
no
importance
.
I
know
too
well
that
I
get
on
*NL*
Lucy
's
nerves
.
Our
tour
was
a
failure
.
She
wanted
to
leave
Florence
,
and
*NL*
when
we
got
to
Rome
she
did
not
want
to
be
in
Rome
,
and
all
the
time
I
*NL*
felt
that
I
was
spending
her
mother
's
money
--
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
keep
to
the
future
,
though
,
''
interrupted
Mr.
Beebe
.
``
I
want
your
*NL*
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Charlotte
,
with
a
choky
abruptness
that
was
new
to
*NL*
him
,
though
familiar
to
Lucy
.
``
I
for
one
will
help
her
to
go
to
Greece
.
*NL*
Will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
absolutely
necessary
,
''
she
continued
,
lowering
her
veil
and
*NL*
whispering
through
it
with
a
passion
,
an
intensity
,
that
surprised
him
.
*NL*
``
I
know
--
I
know
.
''
The
darkness
was
coming
on
,
and
he
felt
that
this
odd
*NL*
woman
really
did
know
.
``
She
must
not
stop
here
a
moment
,
and
we
must
*NL*
keep
quiet
till
she
goes
.
I
trust
that
the
servants
know
nothing
.
*NL*
Afterwards
--
but
I
may
have
said
too
much
already
.
Only
,
Lucy
and
I
are
*NL*
helpless
against
Mrs.
Honeychurch
alone
.
If
you
help
we
may
succeed
.
*NL*
Otherwise
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Otherwise
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Otherwise
,
''
she
repeated
as
if
the
word
held
finality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
help
her
,
''
said
the
clergyman
,
setting
his
jaw
firm
.
``
Come
,
*NL*
let
us
go
back
now
,
and
settle
the
whole
thing
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
burst
into
florid
gratitude
.
The
tavern
sign
--
a
beehive
*NL*
trimmed
evenly
with
bees
--
creaked
in
the
wind
outside
as
she
thanked
*NL*
him
.
Mr.
Beebe
did
not
quite
understand
the
situation
;
but
then
,
he
did
*NL*
not
desire
to
understand
it
,
nor
to
jump
to
the
conclusion
of
``
another
*NL*
man
''
that
would
have
attracted
a
grosser
mind
.
He
only
felt
that
Miss
*NL*
Bartlett
knew
of
some
vague
influence
from
which
the
girl
desired
to
be
*NL*
delivered
,
and
which
might
well
be
clothed
in
the
fleshly
form
.
Its
very
*NL*
vagueness
spurred
him
into
knight-errantry
.
His
belief
in
celibacy
,
so
*NL*
reticent
,
so
carefully
concealed
beneath
his
tolerance
and
culture
,
now
*NL*
came
to
the
surface
and
expanded
like
some
delicate
flower
.
``
They
that
*NL*
marry
do
well
,
but
they
that
refrain
do
better
.
''
So
ran
his
belief
,
*NL*
and
he
never
heard
that
an
engagement
was
broken
off
but
with
a
slight
*NL*
feeling
of
pleasure
.
In
the
case
of
Lucy
,
the
feeling
was
intensified
*NL*
through
dislike
of
Cecil
;
and
he
was
willing
to
go
further
--
to
place
her
*NL*
out
of
danger
until
she
could
confirm
her
resolution
of
virginity
.
The
*NL*
feeling
was
very
subtle
and
quite
undogmatic
,
and
he
never
imparted
it
*NL*
to
any
other
of
the
characters
in
this
entanglement
.
Yet
it
existed
,
*NL*
and
it
alone
explains
his
action
subsequently
,
and
his
influence
on
the
*NL*
action
of
others
.
The
compact
that
he
made
with
Miss
Bartlett
in
the
*NL*
tavern
,
was
to
help
not
only
Lucy
,
but
religion
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
hurried
home
through
a
world
of
black
and
grey
.
He
conversed
on
*NL*
indifferent
topics
:
the
Emersons
'
need
of
a
housekeeper
;
servants
;
*NL*
Italian
servants
;
novels
about
Italy
;
novels
with
a
purpose
;
could
*NL*
literature
influence
life
?
Windy
Corner
glimmered
.
In
the
garden
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Honeychurch
,
now
helped
by
Freddy
,
still
wrestled
with
the
lives
of
her
*NL*
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
gets
too
dark
,
''
she
said
hopelessly
.
``
This
comes
of
putting
off
.
We
*NL*
might
have
known
the
weather
would
break
up
soon
;
and
now
Lucy
wants
to
*NL*
go
to
Greece
.
I
do
n't
know
what
the
world
's
coming
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
''
he
said
,
``
go
to
Greece
she
must
.
Come
up
to
the
*NL*
house
and
let
's
talk
it
over
.
Do
you
,
in
the
first
place
,
mind
her
*NL*
breaking
with
Vyse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Beebe
,
I
'm
thankful
--
simply
thankful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I
,
''
said
Freddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
.
Now
come
up
to
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
conferred
in
the
dining-room
for
half
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
would
never
have
carried
the
Greek
scheme
alone
.
It
was
expensive
*NL*
and
dramatic
--
both
qualities
that
her
mother
loathed
.
Nor
would
*NL*
Charlotte
have
succeeded
.
The
honours
of
the
day
rested
with
Mr.
Beebe
.
*NL*
By
his
tact
and
common
sense
,
and
by
his
influence
as
a
clergyman
--
for
*NL*
a
clergyman
who
was
not
a
fool
influenced
Mrs.
Honeychurch
greatly
--
he
*NL*
bent
her
to
their
purpose
,
``
I
do
n't
see
why
Greece
is
necessary
,
''
she
*NL*
said
;
``
but
as
you
do
,
I
suppose
it
is
all
right
.
It
must
be
something
I
*NL*
ca
n't
understand
.
Lucy
!
Let
's
tell
her
.
Lucy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
playing
the
piano
,
''
Mr.
Beebe
said
.
He
opened
the
door
,
and
*NL*
heard
the
words
of
a
song
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
not
thou
on
beauty
's
charming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
that
Miss
Honeychurch
sang
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
thou
still
when
kings
are
arming
,
*NL*
Taste
not
when
the
wine-cup
glistens
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
song
that
Cecil
gave
her
.
How
odd
girls
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
called
Lucy
,
stopping
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Honeychurch
kindly
.
She
went
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
and
Mr.
Beebe
heard
her
kiss
Lucy
and
say
:
``
I
am
sorry
I
*NL*
was
so
cross
about
Greece
,
but
it
came
on
the
top
of
the
dahlias
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rather
a
hard
voice
said
:
``
Thank
you
,
mother
;
that
does
n't
matter
a
*NL*
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you

have
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
splendid
!
Oh
,
thank
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
followed
.
Lucy
still
sat
at
the
piano
with
her
hands
over
the
*NL*
keys
.
She
was
glad
,
but
he
had
expected
greater
gladness
.
Her
mother
*NL*
bent
over
her
.
Freddy
,
to
whom
she
had
been
singing
,
reclined
on
the
*NL*
floor
with
his
head
against
her
,
and
an
unlit
pipe
between
his
lips
.
*NL*
Oddly
enough
,
the
group
was
beautiful
.
Mr.
Beebe
,
who
loved
the
art
of
*NL*
the
past
,
was
reminded
of
a
favourite
theme
,
the
Santa
Conversazione
,
*NL*
in
which
people
who
care
for
one
another
are
painted
chatting
together
*NL*
about
noble
things
--
a
theme
neither
sensual
nor
sensational
,
and
*NL*
therefore
ignored
by
the
art
of
to-day
.
Why
should
Lucy
want
either
to
*NL*
marry
or
to
travel
when
she
had
such
friends
at
home
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Taste
not
when
the
wine-cup
glistens
,
*NL*
Speak
not
when
the
people
listens
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
she
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
Mr.
Beebe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Beebe
knows
my
rude
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
beautiful
song
and
a
wise
one
,
''
said
he
.
``
Go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
very
good
,
''
she
said
listlessly
.
``
I
forget
why
--
harmony
or
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspected
it
was
unscholarly
.
It
's
so
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tune
's
right
enough
,
''
said
Freddy
,
``
but
the
words
are
rotten
.
Why
*NL*
throw
up
the
sponge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
stupidly
you
talk
!
''
said
his
sister
.
The
Santa
Conversazione
was
*NL*
broken
up
.
After
all
,
there
was
no
reason
that
Lucy
should
talk
about
*NL*
Greece
or
thank
him
for
persuading
her
mother
,
so
he
said
good-bye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Freddy
lit
his
bicycle
lamp
for
him
in
the
porch
,
and
with
his
usual
*NL*
felicity
of
phrase
,
said
:
``
This
has
been
a
day
and
a
half
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
thine
ear
against
the
singer
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
minute
;
she
is
finishing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
red
gold
keep
thy
finger
;
*NL*
Vacant
heart
and
hand
and
eye
*NL*
Easy
live
and
quiet
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
weather
like
this
,
''
said
Freddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beebe
passed
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
main
facts
were
clear
.
She
had
behaved
splendidly
,
and
he
had
*NL*
helped
her
.
He
could
not
expect
to
master
the
details
of
so
big
a
change
*NL*
in
a
girl
's
life
.
If
here
and
there
he
was
dissatisfied
or
puzzled
,
he
*NL*
must
acquiesce
;
she
was
choosing
the
better
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vacant
heart
and
hand
and
eye
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
song
stated
``
the
better
part
''
rather
too
strongly
.
He
half
*NL*
fancied
that
the
soaring
accompaniment
--
which
he
did
not
lose
in
the
*NL*
shout
of
the
gale
--
really
agreed
with
Freddy
,
and
was
gently
criticizing
*NL*
the
words
that
it
adorned
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vacant
heart
and
hand
and
eye
*NL*
Easy
live
and
quiet
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
for
the
fourth
time
Windy
Corner
lay
poised
below
him
--
now
as
a
*NL*
beacon
in
the
roaring
tides
of
darkness
.

Chapter
XIX
:
Lying
to
Mr.
Emerson
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Alans
were
found
in
their
beloved
temperance
hotel
near
*NL*
Bloomsbury
--
a
clean
,
airless
establishment
much
patronized
by
provincial
*NL*
England
.
They
always
perched
there
before
crossing
the
great
seas
,
*NL*
and
for
a
week
or
two
would
fidget
gently
over
clothes
,
guide-books
,
*NL*
mackintosh
squares
,
digestive
bread
,
and
other
Continental
necessaries
.
*NL*
That
there
are
shops
abroad
,
even
in
Athens
,
never
occurred
to
them
,
for
*NL*
they
regarded
travel
as
a
species
of
warfare
,
only
to
be
undertaken
*NL*
by
those
who
have
been
fully
armed
at
the
Haymarket
Stores
.
Miss
*NL*
Honeychurch
,
they
trusted
,
would
take
care
to
equip
herself
duly
.
*NL*
Quinine
could
now
be
obtained
in
tabloids
;
paper
soap
was
a
great
help
*NL*
towards
freshening
up
one
's
face
in
the
train
.
Lucy
promised
,
a
little
*NL*
depressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
of
course
,
you
know
all
about
these
things
,
and
you
have
Mr.
Vyse
*NL*
to
help
you
.
A
gentleman
is
such
a
stand-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
who
had
come
up
to
town
with
her
daughter
,
began
to
*NL*
drum
nervously
upon
her
card-case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
think
it
so
good
of
Mr.
Vyse
to
spare
you
,
''
Miss
Catharine
*NL*
continued
.
``
It
is
not
every
young
man
who
would
be
so
unselfish
.
But
*NL*
perhaps
he
will
come
out
and
join
you
later
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
does
his
work
keep
him
in
London
?
''
said
Miss
Teresa
,
the
more
acute
*NL*
and
less
kindly
of
the
two
sisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
we
shall
see
him
when
he
sees
you
off
.
I
do
so
long
to
see
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
will
see
Lucy
off
,
''
interposed
Mrs.
Honeychurch
.
``
She
does
n't
*NL*
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
hate
seeings-off
,
''
said
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
How
funny
!
I
should
have
thought
that
in
this
case
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
you
are
n't
going
?
It
is
such
a
pleasure
to
have
*NL*
met
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
escaped
,
and
Lucy
said
with
relief
:
``
That
's
all
right
.
We
just
got
*NL*
through
that
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
her
mother
was
annoyed
.
``
I
should
be
told
,
dear
,
that
I
am
*NL*
unsympathetic
.
But
I
can
not
see
why
you
did
n't
tell
your
friends
about
*NL*
Cecil
and
be
done
with
it
.
There
all
the
time
we
had
to
sit
fencing
,
and
*NL*
almost
telling
lies
,
and
be
seen
through
,
too
,
I
dare
say
,
which
is
most
*NL*
unpleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
had
plenty
to
say
in
reply
.
She
described
the
Miss
Alans
'
*NL*
character
:
they
were
such
gossips
,
and
if
one
told
them
,
the
news
would
*NL*
be
everywhere
in
no
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
n't
it
be
everywhere
in
no
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
settled
with
Cecil
not
to
announce
it
until
I
left
England
.
I
*NL*
shall
tell
them
then
.
It
's
much
pleasanter
.
How
wet
it
is
!
Let
's
turn
in
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
''
was
the
British
Museum
.
Mrs.
Honeychurch
refused
.
If
they
must
*NL*
take
shelter
,
let
it
be
in
a
shop
.
Lucy
felt
contemptuous
,
for
she
was
*NL*
on
the
tack
of
caring
for
Greek
sculpture
,
and
had
already
borrowed
a
*NL*
mythical
dictionary
from
Mr.
Beebe
to
get
up
the
names
of
the
goddesses
*NL*
and
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
let
it
be
shop
,
then
.
Let
's
go
to
Mudie
's
.
I
'll
buy
a
*NL*
guide-book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Lucy
,
you
and
Charlotte
and
Mr.
Beebe
all
tell
me
I
'm
*NL*
so
stupid
,
so
I
suppose
I
am
,
but
I
shall
never
understand
this
*NL*
hole-and-corner
work
.
You
've
got
rid
of
Cecil
--
well
and
good
,
and
I
'm
*NL*
thankful
he
's
gone
,
though
I
did
feel
angry
for
the
minute
.
But
why
not
*NL*
announce
it
?
Why
this
hushing
up
and
tip-toeing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
for
a
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
silent
.
She
was
drifting
away
from
her
mother
.
It
was
quite
*NL*
easy
to
say
,
``
Because
George
Emerson
has
been
bothering
me
,
and
if
he
*NL*
hears
I
've
given
up
Cecil
may
begin
again
''
--
quite
easy
,
and
it
had
*NL*
the
incidental
advantage
of
being
true
.
But
she
could
not
say
it
.
She
*NL*
disliked
confidences
,
for
they
might
lead
to
self-knowledge
and
to
that
*NL*
king
of
terrors
--
Light
.
Ever
since
that
last
evening
at
Florence
she
had
*NL*
deemed
it
unwise
to
reveal
her
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Honeychurch
,
too
,
was
silent
.
She
was
thinking
,
``
My
daughter
wo
n't
*NL*
answer
me
;
she
would
rather
be
with
those
inquisitive
old
maids
than
*NL*
with
Freddy
and
me
.
Any
rag
,
tag
,
and
bobtail
apparently
does
if
she
*NL*
can
leave
her
home
.
''
And
as
in
her
case
thoughts
never
remained
unspoken
*NL*
long
,
she
burst
out
with
:
``
You
're
tired
of
Windy
Corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
perfectly
true
.
Lucy
had
hoped
to
return
to
Windy
Corner
when
*NL*
she
escaped
from
Cecil
,
but
she
discovered
that
her
home
existed
no
*NL*
longer
.
It
might
exist
for
Freddy
,
who
still
lived
and
thought
straight
,
*NL*
but
not
for
one
who
had
deliberately
warped
the
brain
.
She
did
not
*NL*
acknowledge
that
her
brain
was
warped
,
for
the
brain
itself
must
assist
*NL*
in
that
acknowledgment
,
and
she
was
disordering
the
very
instruments
of
*NL*
life
.
She
only
felt
,
``
I
do
not
love
George
;
I
broke
off
my
engagement
*NL*
because
I
did
not
love
George
;
I
must
go
to
Greece
because
I
do
not
*NL*
love
George
;
it
is
more
important
that
I
should
look
up
gods
in
the
*NL*
dictionary
than
that
I
should
help
my
mother
;
everyone
else
is
behaving
*NL*
very
badly
.
''
She
only
felt
irritable
and
petulant
,
and
anxious
to
do
*NL*
what
she
was
not
expected
to
do
,
and
in
this
spirit
she
proceeded
with
*NL*
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mother
,
what
rubbish
you
talk
!
Of
course
I
'm
not
tired
of
Windy
*NL*
Corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
not
say
so
at
once
,
instead
of
considering
half
an
hour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
faintly
,
``
Half
a
minute
would
be
nearer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
would
like
to
stay
away
from
your
home
altogether
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
mother
!
People
will
hear
you
''
;
for
they
had
entered
Mudie
's
.
She
*NL*
bought
Baedeker
,
and
then
continued
:
``
Of
course
I
want
to
live
at
home
;
*NL*
but
as
we
are
talking
about
it
,
I
may
as
well
say
that
I
shall
want
to
*NL*
be
away
in
the
future
more
than
I
have
been
.
You
see
,
I
come
into
my
*NL*
money
next
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
came
into
her
mother
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Driven
by
nameless
bewilderment
,
by
what
is
in
older
people
termed
*NL*
``
eccentricity
,
''
Lucy
determined
to
make
this
point
clear
.
``
I
've
seen
the
*NL*
world
so
little
--
I
felt
so
out
of
things
in
Italy
.
I
have
seen
so
little
*NL*
of
life
;
one
ought
to
come
up
to
London
more
--
not
a
cheap
ticket
like
*NL*
to-day
,
but
to
stop
.
I
might
even
share
a
flat
for
a
little
with
some
*NL*
other
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
mess
with
typewriters
and
latch-keys
,
''
exploded
Mrs.
Honeychurch
.
*NL*
``
And
agitate
and
scream
,
and
be
carried
off
kicking
by
the
police
.
And
*NL*
call
it
a
Mission
--
when
no
one
wants
you
!
And
call
it
Duty
--
when
*NL*
it
means
that
you
ca
n't
stand
your
own
home
!
And
call
it
Work
--
when
*NL*
thousands
of
men
are
starving
with
the
competition
as
it
is
!
And
then
*NL*
to
prepare
yourself
,
find
two
doddering
old
ladies
,
and
go
abroad
with
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
more
independence
,
''
said
Lucy
lamely
;
she
knew
that
she
wanted
*NL*
something
,
and
independence
is
a
useful
cry
;
we
can
always
say
that
we
*NL*
have
not
got
it
.
She
tried
to
remember
her
emotions
in
Florence
:
those
*NL*
had
been
sincere
and
passionate
,
and
had
suggested
beauty
rather
than
*NL*
short
skirts
and
latch-keys
.
But
independence
was
certainly
her
cue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
Take
your
independence
and
be
gone
.
Rush
up
and
down
and
*NL*
round
the
world
,
and
come
back
as
thin
as
a
lath
with
the
bad
food
.
*NL*
Despise
the
house
that
your
father
built
and
the
garden
that
he
planted
,
*NL*
and
our
dear
view
--
and
then
share
a
flat
with
another
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
screwed
up
her
mouth
and
said
:
``
Perhaps
I
spoke
hastily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
goodness
!
''
her
mother
flashed
.
``
How
you
do
remind
me
of
Charlotte
*NL*
Bartlett

*NL*
*NL*
``
Charlotte

flashed
Lucy
in
her
turn
,
pierced
at
last
by
a
vivid
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
every
moment

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Charlotte
trying

divide
two
apples

clenched
her
teeth
.
``
My
point
is
that
you
ought
n't
to
have
*NL*
asked
Charlotte
to
stop
.
I
wish
you
would
keep
to
the
point
.
''
And
the
*NL*
conversation
died
off
into
a
wrangle
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
and
her
mother
shopped
in
silence
,
spoke
little
in
the
train
,
little
*NL*
again
in
the
carriage
,
which
met
them
at
Dorking
Station
.
It
had
poured
*NL*
all
day
and
as
they
ascended
through
the
deep
Surrey
lanes
showers
of
*NL*
water
fell
from
the
over-hanging
beech-trees
and
rattled
on
the
hood
.
*NL*
Lucy
complained
that
the
hood
was
stuffy
.
Leaning
forward
,
she
looked
*NL*
out
into
the
steaming
dusk
,
and
watched
the
carriage-lamp
pass
like
a
*NL*
search-light
over
mud
and
leaves
,
and
reveal
nothing
beautiful
.
``
The
*NL*
crush
when
Charlotte
gets
in
will
be
abominable
,
''
she
remarked
.
For
*NL*
they
were
to
pick
up
Miss
Bartlett
at
Summer
Street
,
where
she
had
been
*NL*
dropped
as
the
carriage
went
down
,
to
pay
a
call
on
Mr.
Beebe
's
old
*NL*
mother
.
``
We
shall
have
to
sit
three
a
side
,
because
the
trees
drop
,
and
*NL*
yet
it
is
n't
raining
.
Oh
,
for
a
little
air
!
''
Then
she
listened
to
the
*NL*
horse
's
hoofs
--
``
He
has
not
told
--
he
has
not
told
.
''
That
melody
was
*NL*
blurred
by
the
soft
road
.
``
CA
N'T
we
have
the
hood
down
?
''
she
demanded
,
*NL*
and
her
mother
,
with
sudden
tenderness
,
said
:
``
Very
well
,
old
lady
,
stop
*NL*
the
horse
.
''
And
the
horse
was
stopped
,
and
Lucy
and
Powell
wrestled
with
*NL*
the
hood
,
and
squirted
water
down
Mrs.
Honeychurch
's
neck
.
But
now
*NL*
that
the
hood
was
down
,
she
did
see
something
that
she
would
have
*NL*
missed
--
there
were
no
lights
in
the
windows
of
Cissie
Villa
,
and
round
*NL*
the
garden
gate
she
fancied
she
saw
a
padlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
house
to
let
again
,
Powell
?
''
she
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
miss
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
they
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
far
out
of
town
for
the
young
gentleman
,
and
his
father
's
*NL*
rheumatism
has
come
on
,
so
he
ca
n't
stop
on
alone
,
so
they
are
trying
to
*NL*
let
furnished
,
''
was
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
gone
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
miss
,
they
have
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
sank
back
.
The
carriage
stopped
at
the
Rectory
.
She
got
out
to
call
*NL*
for
Miss
Bartlett
.
So
the
Emersons
had
gone
,
and
all
this
bother
about
*NL*
Greece
had
been
unnecessary
.
Waste
!
That
word
seemed
to
sum
up
the
whole
*NL*
of
life
.
Wasted
plans
,
wasted
money
,
wasted
love
,
and
she
had
wounded
*NL*
her
mother
.
Was
it
possible
that
she
had
muddled
things
away
?
Quite
*NL*
possible
.
Other
people
had
.
When
the
maid
opened
the
door
,
she
was
*NL*
unable
to
speak
,
and
stared
stupidly
into
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bartlett
at
once
came
forward
,
and
after
a
long
preamble
asked
*NL*
a
great
favour
:
might
she
go
to
church
?
Mr.
Beebe
and
his
mother
had
*NL*
already
gone
,
but
she
had
refused
to
start
until
she
obtained
her
*NL*
hostess
's
full
sanction
,
for
it
would
mean
keeping
the
horse
waiting
a
*NL*
good
ten
minutes
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
the
hostess
wearily
.
``
I
forgot
it
was
Friday
.
Let
's
*NL*
all
go
.
Powell
can
go
round
to
the
stables
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
dearest
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
church
for
me
,
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sigh
,
and
they
departed
.
The
church
was
invisible
,
but
up
in
the
*NL*
darkness
to
the
left
there
was
a
hint
of
colour
.
This
was
a
stained
*NL*
window
,
through
which
some
feeble
light
was
shining
,
and
when
the
door
*NL*
opened
Lucy
heard
Mr.
Beebe
's
voice
running
through
the
litany
to
a
*NL*
minute
congregation
.
Even
their
church
,
built
upon
the
slope
of
the
hill
*NL*
so
artfully
,
with
its
beautiful
raised
transept
and
its
spire
of
silvery
*NL*
shingle
--
even
their
church
had
lost
its
charm
;
and
the
thing
one
never
*NL*
talked
about
--
religion
--
was
fading
like
all
the
other
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
the
maid
into
the
Rectory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Would
she
object
to
sitting
in
Mr.
Beebe
's
study
?
There
was
only
that
*NL*
one
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
not
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
was
there
already
,
for
Lucy
heard
the
words
:
``
A
lady
to
wait
,
*NL*
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Mr.
Emerson
was
sitting
by
the
fire
,
with
his
foot
upon
a
*NL*
gout-stool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Miss
Honeychurch
,
that
you
should
come
!
''
he
quavered
;
and
Lucy
saw
*NL*
an
alteration
in
him
since
last
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
word
would
come
to
her
lips
.
George
she
had
faced
,
and
could
have
*NL*
faced
again
,
but
she
had
forgotten
how
to
treat
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Honeychurch
,
dear
,
we
are
so
sorry
!
George
is
so
sorry
!
He
thought
*NL*
he
had
a
right
to
try
.
I
can
not
blame
my
boy
,
and
yet
I
wish
he
had
told
*NL*
me
first
.
He
ought
not
to
have
tried
.
I
knew
nothing
about
it
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
only
she
could
remember
how
to
behave
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
up
his
hand
.
``
But
you
must
not
scold
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
turned
her
back
,
and
began
to
look
at
Mr.
Beebe
's
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
taught
him
,
''
he
quavered
,
``
to
trust
in
love
.
I
said
:
`
When
love
*NL*
comes
,
that
is
reality
.
'
I
said
:
`
Passion
does
not
blind
.
No
.
Passion
*NL*
is
sanity
,
and
the
woman
you
love
,
she
is
the
only
person
you
will
ever
*NL*
really
understand
.
'
''
He
sighed
:
``
True
,
everlastingly
true
,
though
my
day
*NL*
is
over
,
and
though
there
is
the
result
.
Poor
boy
!
He
is
so
sorry
!
*NL*
He
said
he
knew
it
was
madness
when
you
brought
your
cousin
in
;
that
*NL*
whatever
you
felt
you
did
not
mean
.
Yet
''
--
his
voice
gathered
strength
:
*NL*
he
spoke
out
to
make
certain
--
``
Miss
Honeychurch
,
do
you
remember
Italy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
selected
a
book
--
a
volume
of
Old
Testament
commentaries
.
Holding
*NL*
it
up
to
her
eyes
,
she
said
:
``
I
have
no
wish
to
discuss
Italy
or
any
*NL*
subject
connected
with
your
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
remember
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
misbehaved
himself
from
the
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
was
told
that
he
loved
you
last
Sunday
.
I
never
could
judge
*NL*
behaviour
.
I
--
I
--
suppose
he
has
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
a
little
steadier
,
she
put
the
book
back
and
turned
round
to
*NL*
him
.
His
face
was
drooping
and
swollen
,
but
his
eyes
,
though
they
were
*NL*
sunken
deep
,
gleamed
with
a
child
's
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
has
behaved
abominably
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
am
glad
he
is
sorry
.
Do
*NL*
you
know
what
he
did
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
`
abominably
,
'
''
was
the
gentle
correction
.
``
He
only
tried
when
he
*NL*
should
not
have
tried
.
You
have
all
you
want
,
Miss
Honeychurch
:
you
are
*NL*
going
to
marry
the
man
you
love
.
Do
not
go
out
of
George
's
life
saying
*NL*
he
is
abominable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
of
course
,
''
said
Lucy
,
ashamed
at
the
reference
to
Cecil
.
*NL*
''
`
Abominable
'
is
much
too
strong
.
I
am
sorry
I
used
it
about
your
son
.
I
*NL*
think
I
will
go
to
church
,
after
all
.
My
mother
and
my
cousin
have
gone
.
*NL*
I
shall
not
be
so
very
late
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Especially
as
he
has
gone
under
,
''
he
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
under
naturally
.
''
He
beat
his
palms
together
in
silence
;
his
head
*NL*
fell
on
his
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
his
mother
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Mr.
Emerson
--
MR.
EMERSON

what
are
you
talking
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
would
n't
have
George
baptized
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
agreed
that
baptism
was
nothing
,
but
he
caught
that
fever
*NL*
when
he
was
twelve
and
she
turned
round
.
She
thought
it
a
judgement
.
''
He
*NL*
shuddered
.
``
Oh
,
horrible
,
when
we
had
given
up
that
sort
of
thing
and
*NL*
broken
away
from
her
parents

Oh
,
horrible
--
worst
of
all
--
worse
than
*NL*
death
,
when
you
have
made
a
little
clearing
in
the
wilderness
,
planted
*NL*
your
little
garden
,
let
in
your
sunlight
,
and
then
the
weeds
creep
in
*NL*
again
!
A
judgement
!
And
our
boy
had
typhoid
because
no
clergyman
had
*NL*
dropped
water
on
him
in
church
!
Is
it
possible
,
Miss
Honeychurch
?
Shall
*NL*
we
slip
back
into
the
darkness
for
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
gasped
Lucy
.
``
I
do
n't
understand
this
sort
of
thing

I
*NL*
was
not
meant
to
understand
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mr.
Eager

he
came
when

was
out

acted
according

principles

do
n't
blame
him
or
any
one
...
but
by
the
time
George
*NL*
was
well
she
was
ill
.
He
made
her
think
about
sin
,
and
she
went
under
*NL*
thinking
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thus
that
Mr.
Emerson
had
murdered
his
wife
in
the
sight
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
terrible
!

said
Lucy
,
forgetting
her
own
affairs
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
not
baptized

said
the
old
man
.
``
I
did
hold
firm

And
he
*NL*
looked
with
unwavering
eyes
at
the
rows
of
books
,
as
if

at
what
*NL*
cost

he
had
won
a
victory
over
them
.
``
My
boy
shall
go
back
to
the
*NL*
earth
untouched

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
whether
young
Mr.
Emerson
was
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
last
Sunday
.
''
He
started
into
the
present
.
``
George
last
Sunday
--
no
,
*NL*
not
ill

just
gone
under

He
is
never
ill

But
he
is
his
mother
's
son

*NL*
Her
eyes
were
his

and
she
had
that
forehead
that
I
think
so
beautiful

*NL*

he

not

it
worth

It

always
touch

go

He
will
live

he
will
not

it
worth
while
to

He
will
*NL*
never
think
anything
worth

You
remember
that
church
at
Florence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
did
remember
,
and
how
she
had
suggested
that
George
should
collect
*NL*
postage
stamps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
you
left
Florence

horrible

Then
we
took
the
house
here

he
*NL*
goes
bathing
with
your
brother

became
better

You
saw
him
bathing

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
sorry

it
is
no

I

deeply

sorry

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
came
something

George

down
to-morrow

up

*NL*
She
looked
at
the
books
again

black
,
brown
,
and
that
acrid
theological
*NL*
blue
.
They
surrounded
the
visitors
on
every
side
;
they
were
piled
on
the
*NL*
tables
,
they
pressed
against
the
very
ceiling
.
To
Lucy
who
could
not
see
*NL*
that
Mr.
Emerson
was
profoundly
religious
,
and
differed
from
Mr.
Beebe
*NL*
chiefly
by
his
acknowledgment
of
passion
--
it
seemed
dreadful
that
the
*NL*
old
man
should
crawl
into
such
a
sanctum
,
when
he
was
unhappy
,
and
be
*NL*
dependent
on
the
bounty
of
a
clergyman
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
certain
than
ever
that
she
was
tired
,
he
offered
her
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

please
sit
still

I
think
I
will
sit
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Honeychurch

do
sound
tired

*NL*
*NL*
``

Lucy
,
with
trembling
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
,
and
there
's
a
look
of
George
about
you

And
what
were
you
*NL*
saying
about
going
abroad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Greece
''
--
and
she
saw
that
he
was
thinking
the
word
over
--
``
Greece

*NL*
you
were
to
be
married
this

I
thought

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
till

said
Lucy
,
clasping
her
hands
.
Would
she
*NL*
tell
an
actual
lie
when
it
came
to
the
point
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
Mr.

is
going
with

I
hope

it
is

spoke

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Mr.
Beebe
came
back
from
church
.
His
cassock
was
covered
*NL*
with
rain
.
``
That
's
all
right

he
said
kindly
.
``
I
counted
on

And
he
hurried
off
to
the
*NL*
stables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
going

she
said
hoarsely
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
Somehow
it
was
impossible
to
cheat
this
old
man
.
To
George
,
to
Cecil
,
*NL*
she
would
have
lied
again
;
but
he
seemed
so
near
the
end
of
things
,
so
*NL*
dignified
in
his
approach
to
the
gulf
,
of
which
he
gave
one
account
,
and
*NL*
the
books
that
surrounded
him
another
,
so
mild
to
the
rough
paths
that
*NL*
he
had
traversed
,
that
the
true
chivalry
--
not
the
worn-out
chivalry
*NL*
of
sex
,
but
the
true
chivalry
that
all
the
young
may
show
to
all
the
*NL*
old
--
awoke
in
her
,
and
,
at
whatever
risk
,
she
told
him
that
Cecil
was
*NL*
not
her
companion
to
Greece
.
And
she
spoke
so
seriously
that
the
risk
*NL*
became
a
certainty
,
and
he
,
lifting
his
eyes
,
said
:
``
You
are
leaving
*NL*
him
?
You
are
leaving
the
man

love

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

why

''
*NL*
*NL*
Terror
came
over
her
,
and
she
lied
again
.
She
made
the
long
,
convincing
*NL*
speech
that
she
had
made
to
Mr.
Beebe
,
and
intended
to
make
to
the
world
*NL*
when
she
announced
that
her
engagement
was
no
more
.
He
heard
her
in
*NL*
silence
,
and
then
said
:
``
My
dear
,
I
am
worried
about
you
.
It
seems
to
*NL*
me

--
dreamily
;
she
was
not
alarmed

you

*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.

Take
an
old

word

there
's
nothing
worse

It
is
easy
to
face
Death

Fate
,

the
things
that
sound
*NL*
so
dreadful

It
is
on
my
muddles
that
I
look
back
with
horror

on
the
*NL*
things
that
I
might
have
avoided

We
can
help
one
another

little

I
*NL*
used
to
think
I
could
teach
young
people
the
whole
of
life
,
but
I
know
*NL*
better
now
,
and
all
my
teaching
of
George
has
come
down
to
this
:
beware
*NL*
of
muddle

Do
you
remember
in
that
church
,
when
you
pretended
to
be
*NL*
annoyed
with
me

were
n't

Do
you
remember
before
,
when
you
refused
*NL*
the
room
with
the
view

Those
were
muddles

little
,

ominous

I
*NL*
am
fearing
that
you
are
in
one

She
was
silent

She

And

against

Lucy

her

Into

gave
her
a
sense

reconciled

a
feeling
that
,
in
gaining

the

she
loved

she
would
gain
something

Throughout
the
squalor
of
her
homeward
drive
--
she
spoke
at
once

his

salutation
remained

He
had
robbed
the

of
its
taint

the

taunts
of

in
after

*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Alans
did
go
to
Greece
,
but
they
went
by
themselves
.
They
alone
*NL*
of
this
little
company
will
double
Malea
and
plough
the
waters
of
the
*NL*
Saronic
gulf
.
They
alone
will
visit
Athens
and
Delphi
,
and
either
shrine
*NL*
of
intellectual
song
--
that
upon
the
Acropolis
,
encircled
by
blue
seas
;
*NL*
that
under
Parnassus
,
where
the
eagles
build
and
the
bronze
charioteer
*NL*
drives
undismayed
towards
infinity
.
Trembling
,
anxious
,
cumbered
with
*NL*
much
digestive
bread
,
they
did
proceed
to
Constantinople
,
they
did
go
*NL*
round
the
world
.
The
rest
of
us
must
be
contented
with
a
fair
,
but
a
*NL*
less
arduous

goal

Bertolini

*NL*
George
said
it
was
his
old
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
n't

''
said
Lucy
;
``
because
it
is
the
room
I
had

and
I
had
your

I

Charlotte
made
me
,
for
some
reason

*NL*
*NL*
He
knelt
on
the
tiled
floor
,
and
laid
his
face
in
her
lap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
you

get
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
I
be

''
murmured
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unable
to
answer
this
question
,
she
put
down
his
sock
,
which
she
was
*NL*
trying
to
mend
,
and
gazed
out
through
the
window
.
It
was
evening
and
*NL*
again
the
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
bother
Charlotte
,
''
she
said
thoughtfully
.
``
What
can
such
people
be
*NL*
made
of
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Same
stuff
as

are
made

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right

It

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
get
up
off

cold
floor

you
'll
be
starting
rheumatism

next

you
stop
laughing

being
so
silly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
I
laugh
?
''
he
asked
,
pinning
her
with
his
elbows
,
and
*NL*
advancing
his
face
to
hers
.
``
What
's
there
to
cry
at
?
Kiss
me
here
.
''
He
*NL*
indicated
the
spot
where
a
kiss
would
be
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
boy
after
all
.
When
it
came
to
the
point
,
it
was
she
who
*NL*
remembered
the
past
,
she
into
whose
soul
the
iron
had
entered
,
she
*NL*
who
knew
whose
room
this
had
been
last
year
.
It
endeared
him
to
her
*NL*
strangely
that
he
should
be
sometimes
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
letters
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
line
from
Freddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
kiss
me
here
;
then
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
threatened
again
with
rheumatism
,
he
strolled
to
the
window
,
*NL*
opened
it
-LRB-
as
the
English
will
-RRB-
,
and
leant
out
.
There
was
the
parapet
,
*NL*
there
the
river
,
there
to
the
left
the
beginnings
of
the
hills
.
The
*NL*
cab-driver
,
who
at
once
saluted
him
with
the
hiss
of
a
serpent
,
might
*NL*
be
that
very
Phaethon
who
had
set
this
happiness
in
motion
twelve
*NL*
months
ago
.
A
passion
of
gratitude
--
all
feelings
grow
to
passions
in
the
*NL*
South
--
came
over
the
husband
,
and
he
blessed
the
people
and
the
things
*NL*
who
had
taken
so
much
trouble
about
a
young
fool
.
He
had
helped
himself
,
*NL*
it
is
true
,
but
how
stupidly
!
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
fighting
that
mattered
had
been
done
by
others
--
by
Italy
,
by
his
*NL*
father
,
by
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy

you
come

still
shows

*NL*
``

called
the
cabman
,
with
engaging
*NL*
certainty
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
told
him
that
he
was
mistaken
;
they
had
no
money
to
throw
away
on
*NL*
driving
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
people
who
had
not
meant
to
help
--
the
Miss
Lavishes
,
the
Cecils
,
*NL*
the
Miss
Bartletts
!
Ever
prone
to
magnify
Fate
,
George
counted
up
the
*NL*
forces
that
had
swept
him
into
this
contentment

*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
His
own
content
was
absolute
,
but
hers
held
bitterness
:
the
*NL*
Honeychurches
had
not
forgiven
them
;
they
were
disgusted
at
her
past
*NL*
hypocrisy
;
she
had
alienated
Windy
Corner
,
perhaps
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
he
say

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silly
boy

He
thinks

He
knew
we

go
off
in

the

--
he
has
known
it
for
six
months
--
that
if
mother
would
n't
give
*NL*
her
consent
we
should
take
the
thing
into

They
had
fair

now

I

that

not
turned
so

cynical
about

for
the

quite
altered

that
he
did
not
influence
them
so
much
at
Windy
Corner

I

wish

if
we
act
the
truth

the
people

are
sure
to
come
back
to
us
in
the
long
run

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps

Then
he
said
more
gently
:
``
Well

I
acted
the
truth

the
*NL*
only
thing
I
did
do

and
you
came
back

So
possibly
you
know

He
*NL*
turned
back
into
the
room
.
``
Nonsense
with
that
sock

''
He
carried
her
*NL*
to
the
window
,
so
that
she
,
too
,
saw
all
the
view
.
They
sank
upon
their
*NL*
knees
,
invisible
from
the
road
,
they
hoped
,
and
began
to
whisper
one
*NL*
another
's
names
.
Ah
!
it
was
worth
while
;
it
was
the
great
joy
that
they
*NL*
had
expected
,
and
countless
little
joys
of
which
they
had
never
dreamt
.
*NL*
They
were
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Signorino
,

faremo

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

But
Lucy
remembered
the
vendor
of
photographs
and
said
,
``
No
,
do
n't
be
*NL*
rude
to
him
.
''
Then
with
a
catching
of
her
breath
,
she
murmured
:
``
Mr.
*NL*
Eager

think
that
evening

she
kissed

him

``
I
remember
on
how
little
it

known

``

remember

then
went
straight

so

George
was
obstinate
again

was
dozing
by

fire

he
opened
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
there
was
Miss
Bartlett
.
A
few
minutes
before
you
came
in
.
She
was
*NL*
turning
to
go
as
he
woke
up

He
did
n't
speak
to
her

*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
spoke
of
other
things
--
the
desultory
talk
of
those
who
have
*NL*
been
fighting
to
reach
one
another
,
and
whose
reward
is
to
rest
quietly
*NL*
in
each
other
's
arms
.
It
was
long
ere
they
returned
to
Miss
Bartlett
,
*NL*
but
when
they
did
her
behaviour
seemed
more
interesting
.
George
,
who
*NL*
disliked
any
darkness
,
said
:
``
It
's
clear
that
she
knew

Then
,
why
*NL*
did
she
risk
the
meeting
?
She
knew
he
was
there
,
and
yet
she
went
to
*NL*
church

*NL*
*NL*
They
tried
to
piece
the
thing
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
talked
,
an
incredible
solution
came
into
Lucy
's
mind
.
She
*NL*
rejected
it
,
and
said
:
``
How
like
Charlotte
to
undo
her
work
by
a
feeble
*NL*
muddle
at
the
last
moment

''
But
something
in
the
dying
evening
,
in
the
*NL*
roar
of
the
river
,
in
their
very
embrace
warned
them
that
her
words
fell
*NL*
short
of
life
,
and
George
whispered
:
``
Or
did
she
mean
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mean
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

Lucy
bent
forward

said
with
gentleness

*NL*
*NL*
``
Scusi

replied
in

whipped
up
his

horse

*NL*
``

``

The
cabman
drove
away
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mean
what

George
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
whispered
:
``
Is
it
this

Is
this
possible
?
I
'll
put
a
marvel
to
you
.
*NL*
That
your
cousin
has
always
hoped
.
That
from
the
very
first
moment
we
*NL*
met
,
she
hoped
,
far
down
in
her
mind
,
that
we
should
be
like
this
--
of
*NL*
course
,
very
far
down
.
That
she
fought
us
on
the
surface
,
and
yet
she
*NL*
hoped
.
I
ca
n't
explain
her
any
other
way
.
Can
you
?
Look
how
she
kept
me
*NL*
alive
in
you
all
the
summer
;
how
she
gave
you
no
peace
;
how
month
after
*NL*
month
she
became
more
eccentric
and
unreliable
.
The
sight
of
us
haunted
*NL*
her
--
or
she
could
n't
have
described
us
as
she
did
to
her
friend
.
There
*NL*
are
details
--
it
burnt
.
I
read
the
book
afterwards
.
She
is
not
frozen
,
*NL*
Lucy
,
she
is
not
withered
up
all
through
.
She
tore
us
apart
twice
,
but
*NL*
in
the
rectory
that
evening
she
was
given
one
more
chance
to
make
us
*NL*
happy
.
We
can
never
make
friends
with
her
or
thank
her
.
But
I
do
believe
*NL*
that
,
far
down
in
her
heart
,
far
below
all
speech
and
behaviour
,
she
is
*NL*
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
,
''
murmured
Lucy
,
and
then
,
remembering
the
experiences
*NL*
of
her
own
heart
,
she
said
:
``
No
--
it
is
just
possible
.

*NL*
*NL*
Youth
enwrapped
them
;
the
song
of
Phaethon
announced
passion
requited
,
*NL*
love
attained
.
But
they
were
conscious
of
a
love
more
mysterious
than
*NL*
this
.
The
song
died
away
;
they
heard
the
river
,
bearing
down
the
snows
*NL*
of
winter
into
the
Mediterranean
