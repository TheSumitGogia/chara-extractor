THE
SCARLET
LETTER
*NL*
*NL*
by
Nathaniel
Hawthorne
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
EDITOR
'S
NOTE
*NL*
*NL*
Nathaniel
Hawthorne
was
already
a
man
of
forty-six
,
and
a
tale
*NL*
writer
of
some
twenty-four
years
'
standing
,
when
``
The
Scarlet
*NL*
Letter
''
appeared
.
He
was
born
at
Salem
,
Mass.
,
on
July
4th
,
1804
,
*NL*
son
of
a
sea-captain
.
He
led
there
a
shy
and
rather
sombre
life
;
*NL*
of
few
artistic
encouragements
,
yet
not
wholly
uncongenial
,
his
*NL*
moody
,
intensely
meditative
temperament
being
considered
.
Its
*NL*
colours
and
shadows
are
marvelously
reflected
in
his
``
Twice-Told
*NL*
Tales
''
and
other
short
stories
,
the
product
of
his
first
literary
*NL*
period
.
Even
his
college
days
at
Bowdoin
did
not
quite
break
*NL*
through
his
acquired
and
inherited
reserve
;
but
beneath
it
all
,
*NL*
his
faculty
of
divining
men
and
women
was
exercised
with
almost
*NL*
uncanny
prescience
and
subtlety
.
``
The
Scarlet
Letter
,
''
which
*NL*
explains
as
much
of
this
unique
imaginative
art
,
as
is
to
be
*NL*
gathered
from
reading
his
highest
single
achievement
,
yet
needs
*NL*
to
be
ranged
with
his
other
writings
,
early
and
late
,
to
have
its
*NL*
last
effect
.
In
the
year
that
saw
it
published
,
he
began
``
The
*NL*
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
''
a
later
romance
or
prose-tragedy
of
*NL*
the
Puritan-American
community
as
he
had
himself
known
it
--
*NL*
defrauded
of
art
and
the
joy
of
life
,
``
starving
for
symbols
''
as
*NL*
Emerson
has
it
.
Nathaniel
Hawthorne
died
at
Plymouth
,
New
*NL*
Hampshire
,
on
May
18th
,
1864
.

THE

*NL*
*NL*
INTRODUCTORY
TO
``
THE
SCARLET
LETTER
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
little
remarkable
,
that
--
though
disinclined
to
talk
*NL*
overmuch
of
myself
and
my
affairs
at
the
fireside
,
and
to
my
*NL*
personal
friends
--
an
autobiographical
impulse
should
twice
in
my
*NL*
life
have
taken
possession
of
me
,
in
addressing
the
public
.
The
*NL*
first
time
was
three
or
four
years
since
,
when
I
favoured
the
*NL*
reader
--
inexcusably
,
and
for
no
earthly
reason
that
either
the
*NL*
indulgent
reader
or
the
intrusive
author
could
imagine
--
with
a
*NL*
description
of
my
way
of
life
in
the
deep
quietude
of
an
Old
*NL*
Manse
.
And
now
--
because
,
beyond
my
deserts
,
I
was
happy
enough
*NL*
to
find
a
listener
or
two
on
the
former
occasion
--
I
again
seize
*NL*
the
public
by
the
button
,
and
talk
of
my
three
years
'
experience
*NL*
in
a
Custom-House
.
The
example
of
the
famous
``
P.
P.
,
Clerk
of
*NL*
this
Parish
,
''
was
never
more
faithfully
followed
.
The
truth
*NL*
seems
to
be
,
however
,
that
when
he
casts
his
leaves
forth
upon
*NL*
the
wind
,
the
author
addresses
,
not
the
many
who
will
fling
*NL*
aside
his
volume
,
or
never
take
it
up
,
but
the
few
who
will
*NL*
understand
him
better
than
most
of
his
schoolmates
or
lifemates
.
*NL*
Some
authors
,
indeed
,
do
far
more
than
this
,
and
indulge
*NL*
themselves
in
such
confidential
depths
of
revelation
as
could
*NL*
fittingly
be
addressed
only
and
exclusively
to
the
one
heart
and
*NL*
mind
of
perfect
sympathy
;
as
if
the
printed
book
,
thrown
at
*NL*
large
on
the
wide
world
,
were
certain
to
find
out
the
divided
*NL*
segment
of
the
writer
's
own
nature
,
and
complete
his
circle
of
*NL*
existence
by
bringing
him
into
communion
with
it
.
It
is
scarcely
*NL*
decorous
,
however
,
to
speak
all
,
even
where
we
speak
*NL*
impersonally
.
But
,
as
thoughts
are
frozen
and
utterance
*NL*
benumbed
,
unless
the
speaker
stand
in
some
true
relation
with
*NL*
his
audience
,
it
may
be
pardonable
to
imagine
that
a
friend
,
a
*NL*
kind
and
apprehensive
,
though
not
the
closest
friend
,
is
*NL*
listening
to
our
talk
;
and
then
,
a
native
reserve
being
thawed
*NL*
by
this
genial
consciousness
,
we
may
prate
of
the
circumstances
*NL*
that
lie
around
us
,
and
even
of
ourself
,
but
still
keep
the
*NL*
inmost
Me
behind
its
veil
.
To
this
extent
,
and
within
these
*NL*
limits
,
an
author
,
methinks
,
may
be
autobiographical
,
without
*NL*
violating
either
the
reader
's
rights
or
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
seen
,
likewise
,
that
this
Custom-House
sketch
has
a
*NL*
certain
propriety
,
of
a
kind
always
recognised
in
literature
,
as
*NL*
explaining
how
a
large
portion
of
the
following
pages
came
into
*NL*
my
possession
,
and
as
offering
proofs
of
the
authenticity
of
a
*NL*
narrative
therein
contained
.
This
,
in
fact
--
a
desire
to
put
*NL*
myself
in
my
true
position
as
editor
,
or
very
little
more
,
of
*NL*
the
most
prolix
among
the
tales
that
make
up
my
volume
--
this
,
*NL*
and
no
other
,
is
my
true
reason
for
assuming
a
personal
relation
*NL*
with
the
public
.
In
accomplishing
the
main
purpose
,
it
has
*NL*
appeared
allowable
,
by
a
few
extra
touches
,
to
give
a
faint
*NL*
representation
of
a
mode
of
life
not
heretofore
described
,
*NL*
together
with
some
of
the
characters
that
move
in
it
,
among
whom
*NL*
the
author
happened
to
make
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
native
town
of
Salem
,
at
the
head
of
what
,
half
a
century
*NL*
ago
,
in
the
days
of
old
King
Derby
,
was
a
bustling
wharf
--
but
*NL*
which
is
now
burdened
with
decayed
wooden
warehouses
,
and
*NL*
exhibits
few
or
no
symptoms
of
commercial
life
;
except
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
a
bark
or
brig
,
half-way
down
its
melancholy
length
,
discharging
*NL*
hides
;
or
,
nearer
at
hand
,
a
Nova
Scotia
schooner
,
pitching
out
*NL*
her
cargo
of
firewood
--
at
the
head
,
I
say
,
of
this
dilapidated
*NL*
wharf
,
which
the
tide
often
overflows
,
and
along
which
,
at
the
*NL*
base
and
in
the
rear
of
the
row
of
buildings
,
the
track
of
many
*NL*
languid
years
is
seen
in
a
border
of
unthrifty
grass
--
here
,
with
*NL*
a
view
from
its
front
windows
adown
this
not
very
enlivening
*NL*
prospect
,
and
thence
across
the
harbour
,
stands
a
spacious
*NL*
edifice
of
brick
.
From
the
loftiest
point
of
its
roof
,
during
*NL*
precisely
three
and
a
half
hours
of
each
forenoon
,
floats
or
*NL*
droops
,
in
breeze
or
calm
,
the
banner
of
the
republic
;
but
with
*NL*
the
thirteen
stripes
turned
vertically
,
instead
of
horizontally
,
*NL*
and
thus
indicating
that
a
civil
,
and
not
a
military
,
post
of
*NL*
Uncle
Sam
's
government
is
here
established
.
Its
front
is
*NL*
ornamented
with
a
portico
of
half-a-dozen
wooden
pillars
,
*NL*
supporting
a
balcony
,
beneath
which
a
flight
of
wide
granite
*NL*
steps
descends
towards
the
street
.
Over
the
entrance
hovers
an
*NL*
enormous
specimen
of
the
American
eagle
,
with
outspread
wings
,
a
*NL*
shield
before
her
breast
,
and
,
if
I
recollect
aright
,
a
bunch
of
*NL*
intermingled
thunderbolts
and
barbed
arrows
in
each
claw
.
With
*NL*
the
customary
infirmity
of
temper
that
characterizes
this
*NL*
unhappy
fowl
,
she
appears
by
the
fierceness
of
her
beak
and
eye
,
*NL*
and
the
general
truculency
of
her
attitude
,
to
threaten
mischief
*NL*
to
the
inoffensive
community
;
and
especially
to
warn
all
*NL*
citizens
careful
of
their
safety
against
intruding
on
the
*NL*
premises
which
she
overshadows
with
her
wings
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
vixenly
as
she
looks
,
many
people
are
seeking
at
this
very
*NL*
moment
to
shelter
themselves
under
the
wing
of
the
federal
*NL*
eagle
;
imagining
,
I
presume
,
that
her
bosom
has
all
the
softness
*NL*
and
snugness
of
an
eiderdown
pillow
.
But
she
has
no
great
*NL*
tenderness
even
in
her
best
of
moods
,
and
,
sooner
or
*NL*
later
--
oftener
soon
than
late
--
is
apt
to
fling
off
her
nestlings
*NL*
with
a
scratch
of
her
claw
,
a
dab
of
her
beak
,
or
a
rankling
*NL*
wound
from
her
barbed
arrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pavement
round
about
the
above-described
edifice
--
which
we
*NL*
may
as
well
name
at
once
as
the
Custom-House
of
the
port
--
has
*NL*
grass
enough
growing
in
its
chinks
to
show
that
it
has
not
,
of
*NL*
late
days
,
been
worn
by
any
multitudinous
resort
of
business
.
In
*NL*
some
months
of
the
year
,
however
,
there
often
chances
a
forenoon
*NL*
when
affairs
move
onward
with
a
livelier
tread
.
Such
occasions
*NL*
might
remind
the
elderly
citizen
of
that
period
,
before
the
last
*NL*
war
with
England
,
when
Salem
was
a
port
by
itself
;
not
scorned
,
*NL*
as
she
is
now
,
by
her
own
merchants
and
ship-owners
,
who
permit
*NL*
her
wharves
to
crumble
to
ruin
while
their
ventures
go
to
swell
,
*NL*
needlessly
and
imperceptibly
,
the
mighty
flood
of
commerce
at
*NL*
New
York
or
Boston
.
On
some
such
morning
,
when
three
or
four
*NL*
vessels
happen
to
have
arrived
at
once
usually
from
Africa
or
*NL*
South
America
--
or
to
be
on
the
verge
of
their
departure
*NL*
thitherward
,
there
is
a
sound
of
frequent
feet
passing
briskly
*NL*
up
and
down
the
granite
steps
.
Here
,
before
his
own
wife
has
*NL*
greeted
him
,
you
may
greet
the
sea-flushed
ship-master
,
just
in
*NL*
port
,
with
his
vessel
's
papers
under
his
arm
in
a
tarnished
tin
*NL*
box
.
Here
,
too
,
comes
his
owner
,
cheerful
,
sombre
,
gracious
or
*NL*
in
the
sulks
,
accordingly
as
his
scheme
of
the
now
accomplished
*NL*
voyage
has
been
realized
in
merchandise
that
will
readily
be
*NL*
turned
to
gold
,
or
has
buried
him
under
a
bulk
of
incommodities
*NL*
such
as
nobody
will
care
to
rid
him
of
.
Here
,
likewise
--
the
germ
*NL*
of
the
wrinkle-browed
,
grizzly-bearded
,
careworn
merchant
--
we
*NL*
have
the
smart
young
clerk
,
who
gets
the
taste
of
traffic
as
a
*NL*
wolf-cub
does
of
blood
,
and
already
sends
adventures
in
his
*NL*
master
's
ships
,
when
he
had
better
be
sailing
mimic
boats
upon
a
*NL*
mill-pond
.
Another
figure
in
the
scene
is
the
outward-bound
*NL*
sailor
,
in
quest
of
a
protection
;
or
the
recently
arrived
one
,
*NL*
pale
and
feeble
,
seeking
a
passport
to
the
hospital
.
Nor
must
we
*NL*
forget
the
captains
of
the
rusty
little
schooners
that
bring
*NL*
firewood
from
the
British
provinces
;
a
rough-looking
set
of
*NL*
tarpaulins
,
without
the
alertness
of
the
Yankee
aspect
,
but
*NL*
contributing
an
item
of
no
slight
importance
to
our
decaying
*NL*
trade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cluster
all
these
individuals
together
,
as
they
sometimes
were
,
*NL*
with
other
miscellaneous
ones
to
diversify
the
group
,
and
,
for
*NL*
the
time
being
,
it
made
the
Custom-House
a
stirring
scene
.
More
*NL*
frequently
,
however
,
on
ascending
the
steps
,
you
would
discern
--
*NL*
in
the
entry
if
it
were
summer
time
,
or
in
their
appropriate
*NL*
rooms
if
wintry
or
inclement
weathers
--
a
row
of
venerable
*NL*
figures
,
sitting
in
old-fashioned
chairs
,
which
were
tipped
on
*NL*
their
hind
legs
back
against
the
wall
.
Oftentimes
they
were
*NL*
asleep
,
but
occasionally
might
be
heard
talking
together
,
in
*NL*
voices
between
a
speech
and
a
snore
,
and
with
that
lack
of
*NL*
energy
that
distinguishes
the
occupants
of
alms-houses
,
and
all
*NL*
other
human
beings
who
depend
for
subsistence
on
charity
,
on
*NL*
monopolized
labour
,
or
anything
else
but
their
own
independent
*NL*
exertions
.
These
old
gentlemen
--
seated
,
like
Matthew
at
the
*NL*
receipt
of
custom
,
but
not
very
liable
to
be
summoned
thence
,
*NL*
like
him
,
for
apostolic
errands
--
were
Custom-House
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Furthermore
,
on
the
left
hand
as
you
enter
the
front
door
,
is
a
*NL*
certain
room
or
office
,
about
fifteen
feet
square
,
and
of
a
*NL*
lofty
height
,
with
two
of
its
arched
windows
commanding
a
view
*NL*
of
the
aforesaid
dilapidated
wharf
,
and
the
third
looking
across
*NL*
a
narrow
lane
,
and
along
a
portion
of
Derby
Street
.
All
three
*NL*
give
glimpses
of
the
shops
of
grocers
,
block-makers
,
*NL*
slop-sellers
,
and
ship-chandlers
,
around
the
doors
of
which
are
*NL*
generally
to
be
seen
,
laughing
and
gossiping
,
clusters
of
old
*NL*
salts
,
and
such
other
wharf-rats
as
haunt
the
Wapping
of
a
*NL*
seaport
.
The
room
itself
is
cobwebbed
,
and
dingy
with
old
paint
;
*NL*
its
floor
is
strewn
with
grey
sand
,
in
a
fashion
that
has
*NL*
elsewhere
fallen
into
long
disuse
;
and
it
is
easy
to
conclude
,
*NL*
from
the
general
slovenliness
of
the
place
,
that
this
is
a
*NL*
sanctuary
into
which
womankind
,
with
her
tools
of
magic
,
the
*NL*
broom
and
mop
,
has
very
infrequent
access
.
In
the
way
of
*NL*
furniture
,
there
is
a
stove
with
a
voluminous
funnel
;
an
old
*NL*
pine
desk
with
a
three-legged
stool
beside
it
;
two
or
three
*NL*
wooden-bottom
chairs
,
exceedingly
decrepit
and
infirm
;
and
--
not
*NL*
to
forget
the
library
--
on
some
shelves
,
a
score
or
two
of
*NL*
volumes
of
the
Acts
of
Congress
,
and
a
bulky
Digest
of
the
*NL*
Revenue
laws
.
A
tin
pipe
ascends
through
the
ceiling
,
and
forms
*NL*
a
medium
of
vocal
communication
with
other
parts
of
the
edifice
.
*NL*
And
here
,
some
six
months
ago
--
pacing
from
corner
to
corner
,
or
*NL*
lounging
on
the
long-legged
stool
,
with
his
elbow
on
the
desk
,
*NL*
and
his
eyes
wandering
up
and
down
the
columns
of
the
morning
*NL*
newspaper
--
you
might
have
recognised
,
honoured
reader
,
the
same
*NL*
individual
who
welcomed
you
into
his
cheery
little
study
,
where
*NL*
the
sunshine
glimmered
so
pleasantly
through
the
willow
branches
*NL*
on
the
western
side
of
the
Old
Manse
.
But
now
,
should
you
go
*NL*
thither
to
seek
him
,
you
would
inquire
in
vain
for
the
Locofoco
*NL*
Surveyor
.
The
besom
of
reform
hath
swept
him
out
of
office
,
and
*NL*
a
worthier
successor
wears
his
dignity
and
pockets
his
*NL*
emoluments
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
old
town
of
Salem
--
my
native
place
,
though
I
have
dwelt
*NL*
much
away
from
it
both
in
boyhood
and
maturer
years
--
possesses
,
*NL*
or
did
possess
,
a
hold
on
my
affection
,
the
force
of
which
I
*NL*
have
never
realized
during
my
seasons
of
actual
residence
here
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
so
far
as
its
physical
aspect
is
concerned
,
with
its
*NL*
flat
,
unvaried
surface
,
covered
chiefly
with
wooden
houses
,
few
*NL*
or
none
of
which
pretend
to
architectural
beauty
--
its
*NL*
irregularity
,
which
is
neither
picturesque
nor
quaint
,
but
only
*NL*
tame
--
its
long
and
lazy
street
,
lounging
wearisomely
through
the
*NL*
whole
extent
of
the
peninsula
,
with
Gallows
Hill
and
New
Guinea
*NL*
at
one
end
,
and
a
view
of
the
alms-house
at
the
other
--
such
*NL*
being
the
features
of
my
native
town
,
it
would
be
quite
as
*NL*
reasonable
to
form
a
sentimental
attachment
to
a
disarranged
*NL*
checker-board
.
And
yet
,
though
invariably
happiest
elsewhere
,
*NL*
there
is
within
me
a
feeling
for
Old
Salem
,
which
,
in
lack
of
a
*NL*
better
phrase
,
I
must
be
content
to
call
affection
.
The
*NL*
sentiment
is
probably
assignable
to
the
deep
and
aged
roots
*NL*
which
my
family
has
stuck
into
the
soil
.
It
is
now
nearly
two
*NL*
centuries
and
a
quarter
since
the
original
Briton
,
the
earliest
*NL*
emigrant
of
my
name
,
made
his
appearance
in
the
wild
and
*NL*
forest-bordered
settlement
which
has
since
become
a
city
.
And
*NL*
here
his
descendants
have
been
born
and
died
,
and
have
mingled
*NL*
their
earthly
substance
with
the
soil
,
until
no
small
portion
of
*NL*
it
must
necessarily
be
akin
to
the
mortal
frame
wherewith
,
for
a
*NL*
little
while
,
I
walk
the
streets
.
In
part
,
therefore
,
the
*NL*
attachment
which
I
speak
of
is
the
mere
sensuous
sympathy
of
*NL*
dust
for
dust
.
Few
of
my
countrymen
can
know
what
it
is
;
nor
,
as
*NL*
frequent
transplantation
is
perhaps
better
for
the
stock
,
need
*NL*
they
consider
it
desirable
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
sentiment
has
likewise
its
moral
quality
.
The
figure
of
*NL*
that
first
ancestor
,
invested
by
family
tradition
with
a
dim
and
*NL*
dusky
grandeur
,
was
present
to
my
boyish
imagination
as
far
back
*NL*
as
I
can
remember
.
It
still
haunts
me
,
and
induces
a
sort
of
*NL*
home-feeling
with
the
past
,
which
I
scarcely
claim
in
reference
*NL*
to
the
present
phase
of
the
town
.
I
seem
to
have
a
stronger
*NL*
claim
to
a
residence
here
on
account
of
this
grave
,
bearded
,
*NL*
sable-cloaked
,
and
steeple-crowned
progenitor
--
who
came
so
*NL*
early
,
with
his
Bible
and
his
sword
,
and
trode
the
unworn
street
*NL*
with
such
a
stately
port
,
and
made
so
large
a
figure
,
as
a
man
*NL*
of
war
and
peace
--
a
stronger
claim
than
for
myself
,
whose
name
*NL*
is
seldom
heard
and
my
face
hardly
known
.
He
was
a
soldier
,
*NL*
legislator
,
judge
;
he
was
a
ruler
in
the
Church
;
he
had
all
the
*NL*
Puritanic
traits
,
both
good
and
evil
.
He
was
likewise
a
bitter
*NL*
persecutor
;
as
witness
the
Quakers
,
who
have
remembered
him
in
*NL*
their
histories
,
and
relate
an
incident
of
his
hard
severity
*NL*
towards
a
woman
of
their
sect
,
which
will
last
longer
,
it
is
to
*NL*
be
feared
,
than
any
record
of
his
better
deeds
,
although
these
*NL*
were
many
.
His
son
,
too
,
inherited
the
persecuting
spirit
,
and
*NL*
made
himself
so
conspicuous
in
the
martyrdom
of
the
witches
,
*NL*
that
their
blood
may
fairly
be
said
to
have
left
a
stain
upon
*NL*
him
.
So
deep
a
stain
,
indeed
,
that
his
dry
old
bones
,
in
the
*NL*
Charter-street
burial-ground
,
must
still
retain
it
,
if
they
have
*NL*
not
crumbled
utterly
to
dust
!
I
know
not
whether
these
ancestors
*NL*
of
mine
bethought
themselves
to
repent
,
and
ask
pardon
of
Heaven
*NL*
for
their
cruelties
;
or
whether
they
are
now
groaning
under
the
*NL*
heavy
consequences
of
them
in
another
state
of
being
.
At
all
*NL*
events
,
I
,
the
present
writer
,
as
their
representative
,
hereby
*NL*
take
shame
upon
myself
for
their
sakes
,
and
pray
that
any
curse
*NL*
incurred
by
them
--
as
I
have
heard
,
and
as
the
dreary
and
*NL*
unprosperous
condition
of
the
race
,
for
many
a
long
year
back
,
*NL*
would
argue
to
exist
--
may
be
now
and
henceforth
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doubtless
,
however
,
either
of
these
stern
and
black-browed
*NL*
Puritans
would
have
thought
it
quite
a
sufficient
retribution
*NL*
for
his
sins
that
,
after
so
long
a
lapse
of
years
,
the
old
trunk
*NL*
of
the
family
tree
,
with
so
much
venerable
moss
upon
it
,
should
*NL*
have
borne
,
as
its
topmost
bough
,
an
idler
like
myself
.
No
aim
*NL*
that
I
have
ever
cherished
would
they
recognise
as
laudable
;
no
*NL*
success
of
mine
--
if
my
life
,
beyond
its
domestic
scope
,
had
ever
*NL*
been
brightened
by
success
--
would
they
deem
otherwise
than
*NL*
worthless
,
if
not
positively
disgraceful
.
``
What
is
he
?
''
murmurs
*NL*
one
grey
shadow
of
my
forefathers
to
the
other
.
``
A
writer
of
*NL*
story
books
!
What
kind
of
business
in
life
--
what
mode
of
*NL*
glorifying
God
,
or
being
serviceable
to
mankind
in
his
day
and
*NL*
generation
--
may
that
be
?
Why
,
the
degenerate
fellow
might
as
*NL*
well
have
been
a
fiddler
!
''
Such
are
the
compliments
bandied
*NL*
between
my
great
grandsires
and
myself
,
across
the
gulf
of
time
!
*NL*
And
yet
,
let
them
scorn
me
as
they
will
,
strong
traits
of
their
*NL*
nature
have
intertwined
themselves
with
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planted
deep
,
in
the
town
's
earliest
infancy
and
childhood
,
by
*NL*
these
two
earnest
and
energetic
men
,
the
race
has
ever
since
*NL*
subsisted
here
;
always
,
too
,
in
respectability
;
never
,
so
far
as
*NL*
I
have
known
,
disgraced
by
a
single
unworthy
member
;
but
seldom
*NL*
or
never
,
on
the
other
hand
,
after
the
first
two
generations
,
*NL*
performing
any
memorable
deed
,
or
so
much
as
putting
forward
a
*NL*
claim
to
public
notice
.
Gradually
,
they
have
sunk
almost
out
of
*NL*
sight
;
as
old
houses
,
here
and
there
about
the
streets
,
get
*NL*
covered
half-way
to
the
eaves
by
the
accumulation
of
new
soil
.
*NL*
From
father
to
son
,
for
above
a
hundred
years
,
they
followed
the
*NL*
sea
;
a
grey-headed
shipmaster
,
in
each
generation
,
retiring
from
*NL*
the
quarter-deck
to
the
homestead
,
while
a
boy
of
fourteen
took
*NL*
the
hereditary
place
before
the
mast
,
confronting
the
salt
spray
*NL*
and
the
gale
which
had
blustered
against
his
sire
and
grandsire
.
*NL*
The
boy
,
also
in
due
time
,
passed
from
the
forecastle
to
the
*NL*
cabin
,
spent
a
tempestuous
manhood
,
and
returned
from
his
*NL*
world-wanderings
,
to
grow
old
,
and
die
,
and
mingle
his
dust
with
*NL*
the
natal
earth
.
This
long
connexion
of
a
family
with
one
spot
,
*NL*
as
its
place
of
birth
and
burial
,
creates
a
kindred
between
the
*NL*
human
being
and
the
locality
,
quite
independent
of
any
charm
in
*NL*
the
scenery
or
moral
circumstances
that
surround
him
.
It
is
not
*NL*
love
but
instinct
.
The
new
inhabitant
--
who
came
himself
from
a
*NL*
foreign
land
,
or
whose
father
or
grandfather
came
--
has
little
*NL*
claim
to
be
called
a
Salemite
;
he
has
no
conception
of
the
*NL*
oyster-like
tenacity
with
which
an
old
settler
,
over
whom
his
*NL*
third
century
is
creeping
,
clings
to
the
spot
where
his
*NL*
successive
generations
have
been
embedded
.
It
is
no
matter
that
*NL*
the
place
is
joyless
for
him
;
that
he
is
weary
of
the
old
wooden
*NL*
houses
,
the
mud
and
dust
,
the
dead
level
of
site
and
sentiment
,
*NL*
the
chill
east
wind
,
and
the
chillest
of
social
*NL*
atmospheres
;
--
all
these
,
and
whatever
faults
besides
he
may
see
*NL*
or
imagine
,
are
nothing
to
the
purpose
.
The
spell
survives
,
and
*NL*
just
as
powerfully
as
if
the
natal
spot
were
an
earthly
*NL*
paradise
.
So
has
it
been
in
my
case
.
I
felt
it
almost
as
a
*NL*
destiny
to
make
Salem
my
home
;
so
that
the
mould
of
features
and
*NL*
cast
of
character
which
had
all
along
been
familiar
here
--
ever
,
*NL*
as
one
representative
of
the
race
lay
down
in
the
grave
,
another
*NL*
assuming
,
as
it
were
,
his
sentry-march
along
the
main
*NL*
street
--
might
still
in
my
little
day
be
seen
and
recognised
in
*NL*
the
old
town
.
Nevertheless
,
this
very
sentiment
is
an
evidence
*NL*
that
the
connexion
,
which
has
become
an
unhealthy
one
,
should
at
*NL*
last
be
severed
.
Human
nature
will
not
flourish
,
any
more
than
*NL*
a
potato
,
if
it
be
planted
and
re-planted
,
for
too
long
a
series
*NL*
of
generations
,
in
the
same
worn-out
soil
.
My
children
have
had
*NL*
other
birth-places
,
and
,
so
far
as
their
fortunes
may
be
within
*NL*
my
control
,
shall
strike
their
roots
into
unaccustomed
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
emerging
from
the
Old
Manse
,
it
was
chiefly
this
strange
,
*NL*
indolent
,
unjoyous
attachment
for
my
native
town
that
brought
me
*NL*
to
fill
a
place
in
Uncle
Sam
's
brick
edifice
,
when
I
might
as
*NL*
well
,
or
better
,
have
gone
somewhere
else
.
My
doom
was
on
me
.
It
*NL*
was
not
the
first
time
,
nor
the
second
,
that
I
had
gone
away
--
as
*NL*
it
seemed
,
permanently
--
but
yet
returned
,
like
the
bad
*NL*
halfpenny
,
or
as
if
Salem
were
for
me
the
inevitable
centre
of
*NL*
the
universe
.
So
,
one
fine
morning
I
ascended
the
flight
of
*NL*
granite
steps
,
with
the
President
's
commission
in
my
pocket
,
and
*NL*
was
introduced
to
the
corps
of
gentlemen
who
were
to
aid
me
in
*NL*
my
weighty
responsibility
as
chief
executive
officer
of
the
*NL*
Custom-House
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
doubt
greatly
--
or
,
rather
,
I
do
not
doubt
at
all
--
whether
any
*NL*
public
functionary
of
the
United
States
,
either
in
the
civil
or
*NL*
military
line
,
has
ever
had
such
a
patriarchal
body
of
veterans
*NL*
under
his
orders
as
myself
.
The
whereabouts
of
the
Oldest
*NL*
Inhabitant
was
at
once
settled
when
I
looked
at
them
.
For
*NL*
upwards
of
twenty
years
before
this
epoch
,
the
independent
*NL*
position
of
the
Collector
had
kept
the
Salem
Custom-House
out
of
*NL*
the
whirlpool
of
political
vicissitude
,
which
makes
the
tenure
*NL*
of
office
generally
so
fragile
.
A
soldier
--
New
England
's
most
*NL*
distinguished
soldier
--
he
stood
firmly
on
the
pedestal
of
his
*NL*
gallant
services
;
and
,
himself
secure
in
the
wise
liberality
of
*NL*
the
successive
administrations
through
which
he
had
held
office
,
*NL*
he
had
been
the
safety
of
his
subordinates
in
many
an
hour
of
*NL*
danger
and
heart-quake
.
General
Miller
was
radically
*NL*
conservative
;
a
man
over
whose
kindly
nature
habit
had
no
slight
*NL*
influence
;
attaching
himself
strongly
to
familiar
faces
,
and
*NL*
with
difficulty
moved
to
change
,
even
when
change
might
have
*NL*
brought
unquestionable
improvement
.
Thus
,
on
taking
charge
of
my
*NL*
department
,
I
found
few
but
aged
men
.
They
were
ancient
*NL*
sea-captains
,
for
the
most
part
,
who
,
after
being
tossed
on
*NL*
every
sea
,
and
standing
up
sturdily
against
life
's
tempestuous
*NL*
blast
,
had
finally
drifted
into
this
quiet
nook
,
where
,
with
*NL*
little
to
disturb
them
,
except
the
periodical
terrors
of
a
*NL*
Presidential
election
,
they
one
and
all
acquired
a
new
lease
of
*NL*
existence
.
Though
by
no
means
less
liable
than
their
fellow-men
*NL*
to
age
and
infirmity
,
they
had
evidently
some
talisman
or
other
*NL*
that
kept
death
at
bay
.
Two
or
three
of
their
number
,
as
I
was
*NL*
assured
,
being
gouty
and
rheumatic
,
or
perhaps
bed-ridden
,
never
*NL*
dreamed
of
making
their
appearance
at
the
Custom-House
during
a
*NL*
large
part
of
the
year
;
but
,
after
a
torpid
winter
,
would
creep
*NL*
out
into
the
warm
sunshine
of
May
or
June
,
go
lazily
about
what
*NL*
they
termed
duty
,
and
,
at
their
own
leisure
and
convenience
,
*NL*
betake
themselves
to
bed
again
.
I
must
plead
guilty
to
the
*NL*
charge
of
abbreviating
the
official
breath
of
more
than
one
of
*NL*
these
venerable
servants
of
the
republic
.
They
were
allowed
,
on
*NL*
my
representation
,
to
rest
from
their
arduous
labours
,
and
soon
*NL*
afterwards
--
as
if
their
sole
principle
of
life
had
been
zeal
for
*NL*
their
country
's
service
--
as
I
verily
believe
it
was
--
withdrew
to
*NL*
a
better
world
.
It
is
a
pious
consolation
to
me
that
,
through
my
*NL*
interference
,
a
sufficient
space
was
allowed
them
for
repentance
*NL*
of
the
evil
and
corrupt
practices
into
which
,
as
a
matter
of
*NL*
course
,
every
Custom-House
officer
must
be
supposed
to
fall
.
*NL*
Neither
the
front
nor
the
back
entrance
of
the
Custom-House
*NL*
opens
on
the
road
to
Paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
greater
part
of
my
officers
were
Whigs
.
It
was
well
for
*NL*
their
venerable
brotherhood
that
the
new
Surveyor
was
not
a
*NL*
politician
,
and
though
a
faithful
Democrat
in
principle
,
neither
*NL*
received
nor
held
his
office
with
any
reference
to
political
*NL*
services
.
Had
it
been
otherwise
--
had
an
active
politician
been
*NL*
put
into
this
influential
post
,
to
assume
the
easy
task
of
*NL*
making
head
against
a
Whig
Collector
,
whose
infirmities
withheld
*NL*
him
from
the
personal
administration
of
his
office
--
hardly
a
man
*NL*
of
the
old
corps
would
have
drawn
the
breath
of
official
life
*NL*
within
a
month
after
the
exterminating
angel
had
come
up
the
*NL*
Custom-House
steps
.
According
to
the
received
code
in
such
*NL*
matters
,
it
would
have
been
nothing
short
of
duty
,
in
a
*NL*
politician
,
to
bring
every
one
of
those
white
heads
under
the
*NL*
axe
of
the
guillotine
.
It
was
plain
enough
to
discern
that
the
*NL*
old
fellows
dreaded
some
such
discourtesy
at
my
hands
.
It
*NL*
pained
,
and
at
the
same
time
amused
me
,
to
behold
the
terrors
*NL*
that
attended
my
advent
,
to
see
a
furrowed
cheek
,
weather-beaten
*NL*
by
half
a
century
of
storm
,
turn
ashy
pale
at
the
glance
of
so
*NL*
harmless
an
individual
as
myself
;
to
detect
,
as
one
or
another
*NL*
addressed
me
,
the
tremor
of
a
voice
which
,
in
long-past
days
,
*NL*
had
been
wont
to
bellow
through
a
speaking-trumpet
,
hoarsely
*NL*
enough
to
frighten
Boreas
himself
to
silence
.
They
knew
,
these
*NL*
excellent
old
persons
,
that
,
by
all
established
rule
--
and
,
as
*NL*
regarded
some
of
them
,
weighed
by
their
own
lack
of
efficiency
*NL*
for
business
--
they
ought
to
have
given
place
to
younger
men
,
*NL*
more
orthodox
in
politics
,
and
altogether
fitter
than
themselves
*NL*
to
serve
our
common
Uncle
.
I
knew
it
,
too
,
but
could
never
quite
*NL*
find
in
my
heart
to
act
upon
the
knowledge
.
Much
and
deservedly
*NL*
to
my
own
discredit
,
therefore
,
and
considerably
to
the
*NL*
detriment
of
my
official
conscience
,
they
continued
,
during
my
*NL*
incumbency
,
to
creep
about
the
wharves
,
and
loiter
up
and
down
*NL*
the
Custom-House
steps
.
They
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
,
also
,
*NL*
asleep
in
their
accustomed
corners
,
with
their
chairs
tilted
*NL*
back
against
the
walls
;
awaking
,
however
,
once
or
twice
in
the
*NL*
forenoon
,
to
bore
one
another
with
the
several
thousandth
*NL*
repetition
of
old
sea-stories
and
mouldy
jokes
,
that
had
grown
*NL*
to
be
passwords
and
countersigns
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
discovery
was
soon
made
,
I
imagine
,
that
the
new
Surveyor
*NL*
had
no
great
harm
in
him
.
So
,
with
lightsome
hearts
and
the
*NL*
happy
consciousness
of
being
usefully
employed
--
in
their
own
*NL*
behalf
at
least
,
if
not
for
our
beloved
country
--
these
good
old
*NL*
gentlemen
went
through
the
various
formalities
of
office
.
*NL*
Sagaciously
under
their
spectacles
,
did
they
peep
into
the
holds
*NL*
of
vessels
.
Mighty
was
their
fuss
about
little
matters
,
and
*NL*
marvellous
,
sometimes
,
the
obtuseness
that
allowed
greater
ones
*NL*
to
slip
between
their
fingers
Whenever
such
a
mischance
*NL*
occurred
--
when
a
waggon-load
of
valuable
merchandise
had
been
*NL*
smuggled
ashore
,
at
noonday
,
perhaps
,
and
directly
beneath
their
*NL*
unsuspicious
noses
--
nothing
could
exceed
the
vigilance
and
*NL*
alacrity
with
which
they
proceeded
to
lock
,
and
double-lock
,
and
*NL*
secure
with
tape
and
sealing-wax
,
all
the
avenues
of
the
*NL*
delinquent
vessel
.
Instead
of
a
reprimand
for
their
previous
*NL*
negligence
,
the
case
seemed
rather
to
require
an
eulogium
on
*NL*
their
praiseworthy
caution
after
the
mischief
had
happened
;
a
*NL*
grateful
recognition
of
the
promptitude
of
their
zeal
the
moment
*NL*
that
there
was
no
longer
any
remedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unless
people
are
more
than
commonly
disagreeable
,
it
is
my
*NL*
foolish
habit
to
contract
a
kindness
for
them
.
The
better
part
*NL*
of
my
companion
's
character
,
if
it
have
a
better
part
,
is
that
*NL*
which
usually
comes
uppermost
in
my
regard
,
and
forms
the
type
*NL*
whereby
I
recognise
the
man
.
As
most
of
these
old
Custom-House
*NL*
officers
had
good
traits
,
and
as
my
position
in
reference
to
*NL*
them
,
being
paternal
and
protective
,
was
favourable
to
the
*NL*
growth
of
friendly
sentiments
,
I
soon
grew
to
like
them
all
.
It
*NL*
was
pleasant
in
the
summer
forenoons
--
when
the
fervent
heat
,
*NL*
that
almost
liquefied
the
rest
of
the
human
family
,
merely
*NL*
communicated
a
genial
warmth
to
their
half
torpid
systems
--
it
*NL*
was
pleasant
to
hear
them
chatting
in
the
back
entry
,
a
row
of
*NL*
them
all
tipped
against
the
wall
,
as
usual
;
while
the
frozen
*NL*
witticisms
of
past
generations
were
thawed
out
,
and
came
*NL*
bubbling
with
laughter
from
their
lips
.
Externally
,
the
jollity
*NL*
of
aged
men
has
much
in
common
with
the
mirth
of
children
;
the
*NL*
intellect
,
any
more
than
a
deep
sense
of
humour
,
has
little
to
*NL*
do
with
the
matter
;
it
is
,
with
both
,
a
gleam
that
plays
upon
*NL*
the
surface
,
and
imparts
a
sunny
and
cheery
aspect
alike
to
the
*NL*
green
branch
and
grey
,
mouldering
trunk
.
In
one
case
,
however
,
*NL*
it
is
real
sunshine
;
in
the
other
,
it
more
resembles
the
*NL*
phosphorescent
glow
of
decaying
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
sad
injustice
,
the
reader
must
understand
,
to
*NL*
represent
all
my
excellent
old
friends
as
in
their
dotage
.
In
*NL*
the
first
place
,
my
coadjutors
were
not
invariably
old
;
there
*NL*
were
men
among
them
in
their
strength
and
prime
,
of
marked
*NL*
ability
and
energy
,
and
altogether
superior
to
the
sluggish
and
*NL*
dependent
mode
of
life
on
which
their
evil
stars
had
cast
them
.
*NL*
Then
,
moreover
,
the
white
locks
of
age
were
sometimes
found
to
*NL*
be
the
thatch
of
an
intellectual
tenement
in
good
repair
.
But
,
*NL*
as
respects
the
majority
of
my
corps
of
veterans
,
there
will
be
*NL*
no
wrong
done
if
I
characterize
them
generally
as
a
set
of
*NL*
wearisome
old
souls
,
who
had
gathered
nothing
worth
preservation
*NL*
from
their
varied
experience
of
life
.
They
seemed
to
have
flung
*NL*
away
all
the
golden
grain
of
practical
wisdom
,
which
they
had
*NL*
enjoyed
so
many
opportunities
of
harvesting
,
and
most
carefully
*NL*
to
have
stored
their
memory
with
the
husks
.
They
spoke
with
far
*NL*
more
interest
and
unction
of
their
morning
's
breakfast
,
or
*NL*
yesterday
's
,
to-day
's
,
or
tomorrow
's
dinner
,
than
of
the
*NL*
shipwreck
of
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
,
and
all
the
world
's
*NL*
wonders
which
they
had
witnessed
with
their
youthful
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
of
the
Custom-House
--
the
patriarch
,
not
only
of
this
*NL*
little
squad
of
officials
,
but
,
I
am
bold
to
say
,
of
the
*NL*
respectable
body
of
tide-waiters
all
over
the
United
States
--
was
*NL*
a
certain
permanent
Inspector
.
He
might
truly
be
termed
a
*NL*
legitimate
son
of
the
revenue
system
,
dyed
in
the
wool
,
or
*NL*
rather
born
in
the
purple
;
since
his
sire
,
a
Revolutionary
*NL*
colonel
,
and
formerly
collector
of
the
port
,
had
created
an
*NL*
office
for
him
,
and
appointed
him
to
fill
it
,
at
a
period
of
the
*NL*
early
ages
which
few
living
men
can
now
remember
.
This
*NL*
Inspector
,
when
I
first
knew
him
,
was
a
man
of
fourscore
years
,
*NL*
or
thereabouts
,
and
certainly
one
of
the
most
wonderful
*NL*
specimens
of
winter-green
that
you
would
be
likely
to
discover
*NL*
in
a
lifetime
's
search
.
With
his
florid
cheek
,
his
compact
*NL*
figure
smartly
arrayed
in
a
bright-buttoned
blue
coat
,
his
brisk
*NL*
and
vigorous
step
,
and
his
hale
and
hearty
aspect
,
altogether
he
*NL*
seemed
--
not
young
,
indeed
--
but
a
kind
of
new
contrivance
of
*NL*
Mother
Nature
in
the
shape
of
man
,
whom
age
and
infirmity
had
no
*NL*
business
to
touch
.
His
voice
and
laugh
,
which
perpetually
*NL*
re-echoed
through
the
Custom-House
,
had
nothing
of
the
tremulous
*NL*
quaver
and
cackle
of
an
old
man
's
utterance
;
they
came
strutting
*NL*
out
of
his
lungs
,
like
the
crow
of
a
cock
,
or
the
blast
of
a
*NL*
clarion
.
Looking
at
him
merely
as
an
animal
--
and
there
was
very
*NL*
little
else
to
look
at
--
he
was
a
most
satisfactory
object
,
from
*NL*
the
thorough
healthfulness
and
wholesomeness
of
his
system
,
and
*NL*
his
capacity
,
at
that
extreme
age
,
to
enjoy
all
,
or
nearly
all
,
*NL*
the
delights
which
he
had
ever
aimed
at
or
conceived
of
.
The
*NL*
careless
security
of
his
life
in
the
Custom-House
,
on
a
regular
*NL*
income
,
and
with
but
slight
and
infrequent
apprehensions
of
*NL*
removal
,
had
no
doubt
contributed
to
make
time
pass
lightly
over
*NL*
him
.
The
original
and
more
potent
causes
,
however
,
lay
in
the
*NL*
rare
perfection
of
his
animal
nature
,
the
moderate
proportion
of
*NL*
intellect
,
and
the
very
trifling
admixture
of
moral
and
*NL*
spiritual
ingredients
;
these
latter
qualities
,
indeed
,
being
in
*NL*
barely
enough
measure
to
keep
the
old
gentleman
from
walking
on
*NL*
all-fours
.
He
possessed
no
power
of
thought
,
no
depth
of
*NL*
feeling
,
no
troublesome
sensibilities
:
nothing
,
in
short
,
but
a
*NL*
few
commonplace
instincts
,
which
,
aided
by
the
cheerful
temper
*NL*
which
grew
inevitably
out
of
his
physical
well-being
,
did
duty
*NL*
very
respectably
,
and
to
general
acceptance
,
in
lieu
of
a
heart
.
*NL*
He
had
been
the
husband
of
three
wives
,
all
long
since
dead
;
the
*NL*
father
of
twenty
children
,
most
of
whom
,
at
every
age
of
*NL*
childhood
or
maturity
,
had
likewise
returned
to
dust
.
Here
,
one
*NL*
would
suppose
,
might
have
been
sorrow
enough
to
imbue
the
*NL*
sunniest
disposition
through
and
through
with
a
sable
tinge
.
Not
*NL*
so
with
our
old
Inspector
.
One
brief
sigh
sufficed
to
carry
off
*NL*
the
entire
burden
of
these
dismal
reminiscences
.
The
next
moment
*NL*
he
was
as
ready
for
sport
as
any
unbreeched
infant
:
far
readier
*NL*
than
the
Collector
's
junior
clerk
,
who
at
nineteen
years
was
*NL*
much
the
elder
and
graver
man
of
the
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
used
to
watch
and
study
this
patriarchal
personage
with
,
I
*NL*
think
,
livelier
curiosity
than
any
other
form
of
humanity
there
*NL*
presented
to
my
notice
.
He
was
,
in
truth
,
a
rare
phenomenon
;
so
*NL*
perfect
,
in
one
point
of
view
;
so
shallow
,
so
delusive
,
so
*NL*
impalpable
such
an
absolute
nonentity
,
in
every
other
.
My
*NL*
conclusion
was
that
he
had
no
soul
,
no
heart
,
no
mind
;
nothing
,
*NL*
as
I
have
already
said
,
but
instincts
;
and
yet
,
withal
,
so
*NL*
cunningly
had
the
few
materials
of
his
character
been
put
*NL*
together
that
there
was
no
painful
perception
of
deficiency
,
*NL*
but
,
on
my
part
,
an
entire
contentment
with
what
I
found
in
him
.
*NL*
It
might
be
difficult
--
and
it
was
so
--
to
conceive
how
he
should
*NL*
exist
hereafter
,
so
earthly
and
sensuous
did
he
seem
;
but
surely
*NL*
his
existence
here
,
admitting
that
it
was
to
terminate
with
his
*NL*
last
breath
,
had
been
not
unkindly
given
;
with
no
higher
moral
*NL*
responsibilities
than
the
beasts
of
the
field
,
but
with
a
larger
*NL*
scope
of
enjoyment
than
theirs
,
and
with
all
their
blessed
*NL*
immunity
from
the
dreariness
and
duskiness
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
point
in
which
he
had
vastly
the
advantage
over
his
*NL*
four-footed
brethren
was
his
ability
to
recollect
the
good
*NL*
dinners
which
it
had
made
no
small
portion
of
the
happiness
of
*NL*
his
life
to
eat
.
His
gourmandism
was
a
highly
agreeable
trait
;
*NL*
and
to
hear
him
talk
of
roast
meat
was
as
appetizing
as
a
pickle
*NL*
or
an
oyster
.
As
he
possessed
no
higher
attribute
,
and
neither
*NL*
sacrificed
nor
vitiated
any
spiritual
endowment
by
devoting
all
*NL*
his
energies
and
ingenuities
to
subserve
the
delight
and
profit
*NL*
of
his
maw
,
it
always
pleased
and
satisfied
me
to
hear
him
*NL*
expatiate
on
fish
,
poultry
,
and
butcher
's
meat
,
and
the
most
*NL*
eligible
methods
of
preparing
them
for
the
table
.
His
*NL*
reminiscences
of
good
cheer
,
however
ancient
the
date
of
the
*NL*
actual
banquet
,
seemed
to
bring
the
savour
of
pig
or
turkey
*NL*
under
one
's
very
nostrils
.
There
were
flavours
on
his
palate
*NL*
that
had
lingered
there
not
less
than
sixty
or
seventy
years
,
*NL*
and
were
still
apparently
as
fresh
as
that
of
the
mutton
chop
*NL*
which
he
had
just
devoured
for
his
breakfast
.
I
have
heard
him
*NL*
smack
his
lips
over
dinners
,
every
guest
at
which
,
except
*NL*
himself
,
had
long
been
food
for
worms
.
It
was
marvellous
to
*NL*
observe
how
the
ghosts
of
bygone
meals
were
continually
rising
*NL*
up
before
him
--
not
in
anger
or
retribution
,
but
as
if
grateful
*NL*
for
his
former
appreciation
,
and
seeking
to
reduplicate
an
*NL*
endless
series
of
enjoyment
,
at
once
shadowy
and
sensual
:
a
*NL*
tenderloin
of
beef
,
a
hind-quarter
of
veal
,
a
spare-rib
of
*NL*
pork
,
a
particular
chicken
,
or
a
remarkably
praiseworthy
turkey
,
*NL*
which
had
perhaps
adorned
his
board
in
the
days
of
the
elder
*NL*
Adams
,
would
be
remembered
;
while
all
the
subsequent
experience
*NL*
of
our
race
,
and
all
the
events
that
brightened
or
darkened
his
*NL*
individual
career
,
had
gone
over
him
with
as
little
permanent
*NL*
effect
as
the
passing
breeze
.
The
chief
tragic
event
of
the
old
*NL*
man
's
life
,
so
far
as
I
could
judge
,
was
his
mishap
with
a
*NL*
certain
goose
,
which
lived
and
died
some
twenty
or
forty
years
*NL*
ago
:
a
goose
of
most
promising
figure
,
but
which
,
at
table
,
*NL*
proved
so
inveterately
tough
,
that
the
carving-knife
would
make
*NL*
no
impression
on
its
carcase
,
and
it
could
only
be
divided
with
*NL*
an
axe
and
handsaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
time
to
quit
this
sketch
;
on
which
,
however
,
I
should
*NL*
be
glad
to
dwell
at
considerably
more
length
,
because
of
all
men
*NL*
whom
I
have
ever
known
,
this
individual
was
fittest
to
be
a
*NL*
Custom-House
officer
.
Most
persons
,
owing
to
causes
which
I
may
*NL*
not
have
space
to
hint
at
,
suffer
moral
detriment
from
this
*NL*
peculiar
mode
of
life
.
The
old
Inspector
was
incapable
of
it
;
*NL*
and
,
were
he
to
continue
in
office
to
the
end
of
time
,
would
be
*NL*
just
as
good
as
he
was
then
,
and
sit
down
to
dinner
with
just
as
*NL*
good
an
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
one
likeness
,
without
which
my
gallery
of
Custom-House
*NL*
portraits
would
be
strangely
incomplete
,
but
which
my
*NL*
comparatively
few
opportunities
for
observation
enable
me
to
*NL*
sketch
only
in
the
merest
outline
.
It
is
that
of
the
Collector
,
*NL*
our
gallant
old
General
,
who
,
after
his
brilliant
military
*NL*
service
,
subsequently
to
which
he
had
ruled
over
a
wild
Western
*NL*
territory
,
had
come
hither
,
twenty
years
before
,
to
spend
the
*NL*
decline
of
his
varied
and
honourable
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brave
soldier
had
already
numbered
,
nearly
or
quite
,
his
*NL*
three-score
years
and
ten
,
and
was
pursuing
the
remainder
of
his
*NL*
earthly
march
,
burdened
with
infirmities
which
even
the
martial
*NL*
music
of
his
own
spirit-stirring
recollections
could
do
little
*NL*
towards
lightening
.
The
step
was
palsied
now
,
that
had
been
*NL*
foremost
in
the
charge
.
It
was
only
with
the
assistance
of
a
*NL*
servant
,
and
by
leaning
his
hand
heavily
on
the
iron
balustrade
,
*NL*
that
he
could
slowly
and
painfully
ascend
the
Custom-House
*NL*
steps
,
and
,
with
a
toilsome
progress
across
the
floor
,
attain
*NL*
his
customary
chair
beside
the
fireplace
.
There
he
used
to
sit
,
*NL*
gazing
with
a
somewhat
dim
serenity
of
aspect
at
the
figures
*NL*
that
came
and
went
,
amid
the
rustle
of
papers
,
the
administering
*NL*
of
oaths
,
the
discussion
of
business
,
and
the
casual
talk
of
the
*NL*
office
;
all
which
sounds
and
circumstances
seemed
but
*NL*
indistinctly
to
impress
his
senses
,
and
hardly
to
make
their
way
*NL*
into
his
inner
sphere
of
contemplation
.
His
countenance
,
in
this
*NL*
repose
,
was
mild
and
kindly
.
If
his
notice
was
sought
,
an
*NL*
expression
of
courtesy
and
interest
gleamed
out
upon
his
*NL*
features
,
proving
that
there
was
light
within
him
,
and
that
it
*NL*
was
only
the
outward
medium
of
the
intellectual
lamp
that
*NL*
obstructed
the
rays
in
their
passage
.
The
closer
you
penetrated
*NL*
to
the
substance
of
his
mind
,
the
sounder
it
appeared
.
When
no
*NL*
longer
called
upon
to
speak
or
listen
--
either
of
which
*NL*
operations
cost
him
an
evident
effort
--
his
face
would
briefly
*NL*
subside
into
its
former
not
uncheerful
quietude
.
It
was
not
*NL*
painful
to
behold
this
look
;
for
,
though
dim
,
it
had
not
the
*NL*
imbecility
of
decaying
age
.
The
framework
of
his
nature
,
*NL*
originally
strong
and
massive
,
was
not
yet
crumpled
into
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
observe
and
define
his
character
,
however
,
under
such
*NL*
disadvantages
,
was
as
difficult
a
task
as
to
trace
out
and
build
*NL*
up
anew
,
in
imagination
,
an
old
fortress
,
like
Ticonderoga
,
from
*NL*
a
view
of
its
grey
and
broken
ruins
.
Here
and
there
,
perchance
,
*NL*
the
walls
may
remain
almost
complete
;
but
elsewhere
may
be
only
*NL*
a
shapeless
mound
,
cumbrous
with
its
very
strength
,
and
*NL*
overgrown
,
through
long
years
of
peace
and
neglect
,
with
grass
*NL*
and
alien
weeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
looking
at
the
old
warrior
with
affection
--
for
,
*NL*
slight
as
was
the
communication
between
us
,
my
feeling
towards
*NL*
him
,
like
that
of
all
bipeds
and
quadrupeds
who
knew
him
,
might
*NL*
not
improperly
be
termed
so
,
--
I
could
discern
the
main
points
of
*NL*
his
portrait
.
It
was
marked
with
the
noble
and
heroic
qualities
*NL*
which
showed
it
to
be
not
a
mere
accident
,
but
of
good
right
,
*NL*
that
he
had
won
a
distinguished
name
.
His
spirit
could
never
,
I
*NL*
conceive
,
have
been
characterized
by
an
uneasy
activity
;
it
*NL*
must
,
at
any
period
of
his
life
,
have
required
an
impulse
to
set
*NL*
him
in
motion
;
but
once
stirred
up
,
with
obstacles
to
overcome
,
*NL*
and
an
adequate
object
to
be
attained
,
it
was
not
in
the
man
to
*NL*
give
out
or
fail
.
The
heat
that
had
formerly
pervaded
his
*NL*
nature
,
and
which
was
not
yet
extinct
,
was
never
of
the
kind
*NL*
that
flashes
and
flickers
in
a
blaze
;
but
rather
a
deep
red
*NL*
glow
,
as
of
iron
in
a
furnace
.
Weight
,
solidity
,
firmness
--
this
*NL*
was
the
expression
of
his
repose
,
even
in
such
decay
as
had
*NL*
crept
untimely
over
him
at
the
period
of
which
I
speak
.
But
I
*NL*
could
imagine
,
even
then
,
that
,
under
some
excitement
which
*NL*
should
go
deeply
into
his
consciousness
--
roused
by
a
trumpet
's
*NL*
peal
,
loud
enough
to
awaken
all
of
his
energies
that
were
not
*NL*
dead
,
but
only
slumbering
--
he
was
yet
capable
of
flinging
off
*NL*
his
infirmities
like
a
sick
man
's
gown
,
dropping
the
staff
of
*NL*
age
to
seize
a
battle-sword
,
and
starting
up
once
more
a
*NL*
warrior
.
And
,
in
so
intense
a
moment
his
demeanour
would
have
*NL*
still
been
calm
.
Such
an
exhibition
,
however
,
was
but
to
be
*NL*
pictured
in
fancy
;
not
to
be
anticipated
,
nor
desired
.
What
I
*NL*
saw
in
him
--
as
evidently
as
the
indestructible
ramparts
of
Old
*NL*
Ticonderoga
,
already
cited
as
the
most
appropriate
simile
--
was
*NL*
the
features
of
stubborn
and
ponderous
endurance
,
which
might
*NL*
well
have
amounted
to
obstinacy
in
his
earlier
days
;
of
*NL*
integrity
,
that
,
like
most
of
his
other
endowments
,
lay
in
a
*NL*
somewhat
heavy
mass
,
and
was
just
as
unmalleable
or
unmanageable
*NL*
as
a
ton
of
iron
ore
;
and
of
benevolence
which
,
fiercely
as
he
*NL*
led
the
bayonets
on
at
Chippewa
or
Fort
Erie
,
I
take
to
be
of
*NL*
quite
as
genuine
a
stamp
as
what
actuates
any
or
all
the
*NL*
polemical
philanthropists
of
the
age
.
He
had
slain
men
with
his
*NL*
own
hand
,
for
aught
I
know
--
certainly
,
they
had
fallen
like
*NL*
blades
of
grass
at
the
sweep
of
the
scythe
before
the
charge
to
*NL*
which
his
spirit
imparted
its
triumphant
energy
--
but
,
be
that
as
*NL*
it
might
,
there
was
never
in
his
heart
so
much
cruelty
as
would
*NL*
have
brushed
the
down
off
a
butterfly
's
wing
.
I
have
not
known
*NL*
the
man
to
whose
innate
kindliness
I
would
more
confidently
make
*NL*
an
appeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
characteristics
--
and
those
,
too
,
which
contribute
not
the
*NL*
least
forcibly
to
impart
resemblance
in
a
sketch
--
must
have
*NL*
vanished
,
or
been
obscured
,
before
I
met
the
General
.
All
merely
*NL*
graceful
attributes
are
usually
the
most
evanescent
;
nor
does
*NL*
nature
adorn
the
human
ruin
with
blossoms
of
new
beauty
,
that
*NL*
have
their
roots
and
proper
nutriment
only
in
the
chinks
and
*NL*
crevices
of
decay
,
as
she
sows
wall-flowers
over
the
ruined
*NL*
fortress
of
Ticonderoga
.
Still
,
even
in
respect
of
grace
and
*NL*
beauty
,
there
were
points
well
worth
noting
.
A
ray
of
humour
,
*NL*
now
and
then
,
would
make
its
way
through
the
veil
of
dim
*NL*
obstruction
,
and
glimmer
pleasantly
upon
our
faces
.
A
trait
of
*NL*
native
elegance
,
seldom
seen
in
the
masculine
character
after
*NL*
childhood
or
early
youth
,
was
shown
in
the
General
's
fondness
*NL*
for
the
sight
and
fragrance
of
flowers
.
An
old
soldier
might
be
*NL*
supposed
to
prize
only
the
bloody
laurel
on
his
brow
;
but
here
*NL*
was
one
who
seemed
to
have
a
young
girl
's
appreciation
of
the
*NL*
floral
tribe
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
beside
the
fireplace
,
the
brave
old
General
used
to
sit
;
*NL*
while
the
Surveyor
--
though
seldom
,
when
it
could
be
avoided
,
*NL*
taking
upon
himself
the
difficult
task
of
engaging
him
in
*NL*
conversation
--
was
fond
of
standing
at
a
distance
,
and
watching
*NL*
his
quiet
and
almost
slumberous
countenance
.
He
seemed
away
from
*NL*
us
,
although
we
saw
him
but
a
few
yards
off
;
remote
,
though
we
*NL*
passed
close
beside
his
chair
;
unattainable
,
though
we
might
*NL*
have
stretched
forth
our
hands
and
touched
his
own
.
It
might
be
*NL*
that
he
lived
a
more
real
life
within
his
thoughts
than
amid
the
*NL*
unappropriate
environment
of
the
Collector
's
office
.
The
*NL*
evolutions
of
the
parade
;
the
tumult
of
the
battle
;
the
flourish
*NL*
of
old
heroic
music
,
heard
thirty
years
before
--
such
scenes
and
*NL*
sounds
,
perhaps
,
were
all
alive
before
his
intellectual
sense
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
merchants
and
ship-masters
,
the
spruce
clerks
and
*NL*
uncouth
sailors
,
entered
and
departed
;
the
bustle
of
his
*NL*
commercial
and
Custom-House
life
kept
up
its
little
murmur
round
*NL*
about
him
;
and
neither
with
the
men
nor
their
affairs
did
the
*NL*
General
appear
to
sustain
the
most
distant
relation
.
He
was
as
*NL*
much
out
of
place
as
an
old
sword
--
now
rusty
,
but
which
had
*NL*
flashed
once
in
the
battle
's
front
,
and
showed
still
a
bright
*NL*
gleam
along
its
blade
--
would
have
been
among
the
inkstands
,
*NL*
paper-folders
,
and
mahogany
rulers
on
the
Deputy
Collector
's
*NL*
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
thing
that
much
aided
me
in
renewing
and
*NL*
re-creating
the
stalwart
soldier
of
the
Niagara
frontier
--
the
*NL*
man
of
true
and
simple
energy
.
It
was
the
recollection
of
those
*NL*
memorable
words
of
his
--
``
I
'll
try
,
Sir
''
--
spoken
on
the
very
*NL*
verge
of
a
desperate
and
heroic
enterprise
,
and
breathing
the
*NL*
soul
and
spirit
of
New
England
hardihood
,
comprehending
all
*NL*
perils
,
and
encountering
all
.
If
,
in
our
country
,
valour
were
*NL*
rewarded
by
heraldic
honour
,
this
phrase
--
which
it
seems
so
easy
*NL*
to
speak
,
but
which
only
he
,
with
such
a
task
of
danger
and
*NL*
glory
before
him
,
has
ever
spoken
--
would
be
the
best
and
fittest
*NL*
of
all
mottoes
for
the
General
's
shield
of
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
contributes
greatly
towards
a
man
's
moral
and
intellectual
*NL*
health
to
be
brought
into
habits
of
companionship
with
*NL*
individuals
unlike
himself
,
who
care
little
for
his
pursuits
,
*NL*
and
whose
sphere
and
abilities
he
must
go
out
of
himself
to
*NL*
appreciate
.
The
accidents
of
my
life
have
often
afforded
me
this
*NL*
advantage
,
but
never
with
more
fulness
and
variety
than
during
*NL*
my
continuance
in
office
.
There
was
one
man
,
especially
,
the
*NL*
observation
of
whose
character
gave
me
a
new
idea
of
talent
.
His
*NL*
gifts
were
emphatically
those
of
a
man
of
business
;
prompt
,
*NL*
acute
,
clear-minded
;
with
an
eye
that
saw
through
all
*NL*
perplexities
,
and
a
faculty
of
arrangement
that
made
them
vanish
*NL*
as
by
the
waving
of
an
enchanter
's
wand
.
Bred
up
from
boyhood
in
*NL*
the
Custom-House
,
it
was
his
proper
field
of
activity
;
and
the
*NL*
many
intricacies
of
business
,
so
harassing
to
the
interloper
,
*NL*
presented
themselves
before
him
with
the
regularity
of
a
*NL*
perfectly
comprehended
system
.
In
my
contemplation
,
he
stood
as
*NL*
the
ideal
of
his
class
.
He
was
,
indeed
,
the
Custom-House
in
*NL*
himself
;
or
,
at
all
events
,
the
mainspring
that
kept
its
*NL*
variously
revolving
wheels
in
motion
;
for
,
in
an
institution
*NL*
like
this
,
where
its
officers
are
appointed
to
subserve
their
*NL*
own
profit
and
convenience
,
and
seldom
with
a
leading
reference
*NL*
to
their
fitness
for
the
duty
to
be
performed
,
they
must
*NL*
perforce
seek
elsewhere
the
dexterity
which
is
not
in
them
.
*NL*
Thus
,
by
an
inevitable
necessity
,
as
a
magnet
attracts
*NL*
steel-filings
,
so
did
our
man
of
business
draw
to
himself
the
*NL*
difficulties
which
everybody
met
with
.
With
an
easy
*NL*
condescension
,
and
kind
forbearance
towards
our
*NL*
stupidity
--
which
,
to
his
order
of
mind
,
must
have
seemed
little
*NL*
short
of
crime
--
would
he
forth-with
,
by
the
merest
touch
of
his
*NL*
finger
,
make
the
incomprehensible
as
clear
as
daylight
.
The
*NL*
merchants
valued
him
not
less
than
we
,
his
esoteric
friends
.
His
*NL*
integrity
was
perfect
;
it
was
a
law
of
nature
with
him
,
rather
*NL*
than
a
choice
or
a
principle
;
nor
can
it
be
otherwise
than
the
*NL*
main
condition
of
an
intellect
so
remarkably
clear
and
accurate
*NL*
as
his
to
be
honest
and
regular
in
the
administration
of
*NL*
affairs
.
A
stain
on
his
conscience
,
as
to
anything
that
came
*NL*
within
the
range
of
his
vocation
,
would
trouble
such
a
man
very
*NL*
much
in
the
same
way
,
though
to
a
far
greater
degree
,
than
an
*NL*
error
in
the
balance
of
an
account
,
or
an
ink-blot
on
the
fair
*NL*
page
of
a
book
of
record
.
Here
,
in
a
word
--
and
it
is
a
rare
*NL*
instance
in
my
life
--
I
had
met
with
a
person
thoroughly
adapted
*NL*
to
the
situation
which
he
held
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
some
of
the
people
with
whom
I
now
found
myself
*NL*
connected
.
I
took
it
in
good
part
,
at
the
hands
of
Providence
,
*NL*
that
I
was
thrown
into
a
position
so
little
akin
to
my
past
*NL*
habits
;
and
set
myself
seriously
to
gather
from
it
whatever
*NL*
profit
was
to
be
had
.
After
my
fellowship
of
toil
and
*NL*
impracticable
schemes
with
the
dreamy
brethren
of
Brook
Farm
;
*NL*
after
living
for
three
years
within
the
subtle
influence
of
an
*NL*
intellect
like
Emerson
's
;
after
those
wild
,
free
days
on
the
*NL*
Assabeth
,
indulging
fantastic
speculations
,
beside
our
fire
of
*NL*
fallen
boughs
,
with
Ellery
Channing
;
after
talking
with
Thoreau
*NL*
about
pine-trees
and
Indian
relics
in
his
hermitage
at
Walden
;
*NL*
after
growing
fastidious
by
sympathy
with
the
classic
refinement
*NL*
of
Hillard
's
culture
;
after
becoming
imbued
with
poetic
*NL*
sentiment
at
Longfellow
's
hearthstone
--
it
was
time
,
at
length
,
*NL*
that
I
should
exercise
other
faculties
of
my
nature
,
and
nourish
*NL*
myself
with
food
for
which
I
had
hitherto
had
little
appetite
.
*NL*
Even
the
old
Inspector
was
desirable
,
as
a
change
of
diet
,
to
a
*NL*
man
who
had
known
Alcott
.
I
looked
upon
it
as
an
evidence
,
in
*NL*
some
measure
,
of
a
system
naturally
well
balanced
,
and
lacking
*NL*
no
essential
part
of
a
thorough
organization
,
that
,
with
such
*NL*
associates
to
remember
,
I
could
mingle
at
once
with
men
of
*NL*
altogether
different
qualities
,
and
never
murmur
at
the
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
Literature
,
its
exertions
and
objects
,
were
now
of
little
moment
*NL*
in
my
regard
.
I
cared
not
at
this
period
for
books
;
they
were
*NL*
apart
from
me
.
Nature
--
except
it
were
human
nature
--
the
nature
*NL*
that
is
developed
in
earth
and
sky
,
was
,
in
one
sense
,
hidden
*NL*
from
me
;
and
all
the
imaginative
delight
wherewith
it
had
been
*NL*
spiritualized
passed
away
out
of
my
mind
.
A
gift
,
a
faculty
,
if
*NL*
it
had
not
been
departed
,
was
suspended
and
inanimate
within
me
.
*NL*
There
would
have
been
something
sad
,
unutterably
dreary
,
in
all
*NL*
this
,
had
I
not
been
conscious
that
it
lay
at
my
own
option
to
*NL*
recall
whatever
was
valuable
in
the
past
.
It
might
be
true
,
*NL*
indeed
,
that
this
was
a
life
which
could
not
,
with
impunity
,
be
*NL*
lived
too
long
;
else
,
it
might
make
me
permanently
other
than
I
*NL*
had
been
,
without
transforming
me
into
any
shape
which
it
would
*NL*
be
worth
my
while
to
take
.
But
I
never
considered
it
as
other
*NL*
than
a
transitory
life
.
There
was
always
a
prophetic
instinct
,
a
*NL*
low
whisper
in
my
ear
,
that
within
no
long
period
,
and
whenever
*NL*
a
new
change
of
custom
should
be
essential
to
my
good
,
change
*NL*
would
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
there
I
was
,
a
Surveyor
of
the
Revenue
and
,
so
far
as
*NL*
I
have
been
able
to
understand
,
as
good
a
Surveyor
as
need
be
.
A
*NL*
man
of
thought
,
fancy
,
and
sensibility
-LRB-
had
he
ten
times
the
*NL*
Surveyor
's
proportion
of
those
qualities
-RRB-
,
may
,
at
any
time
,
be
*NL*
a
man
of
affairs
,
if
he
will
only
choose
to
give
himself
the
*NL*
trouble
.
My
fellow-officers
,
and
the
merchants
and
sea-captains
*NL*
with
whom
my
official
duties
brought
me
into
any
manner
of
*NL*
connection
,
viewed
me
in
no
other
light
,
and
probably
knew
me
in
*NL*
no
other
character
.
None
of
them
,
I
presume
,
had
ever
read
a
*NL*
page
of
my
inditing
,
or
would
have
cared
a
fig
the
more
for
me
*NL*
if
they
had
read
them
all
;
nor
would
it
have
mended
the
matter
,
*NL*
in
the
least
,
had
those
same
unprofitable
pages
been
written
*NL*
with
a
pen
like
that
of
Burns
or
of
Chaucer
,
each
of
whom
was
a
*NL*
Custom-House
officer
in
his
day
,
as
well
as
I
.
It
is
a
good
*NL*
lesson
--
though
it
may
often
be
a
hard
one
--
for
a
man
who
has
*NL*
dreamed
of
literary
fame
,
and
of
making
for
himself
a
rank
among
*NL*
the
world
's
dignitaries
by
such
means
,
to
step
aside
out
of
the
*NL*
narrow
circle
in
which
his
claims
are
recognized
and
to
find
how
*NL*
utterly
devoid
of
significance
,
beyond
that
circle
,
is
all
that
*NL*
he
achieves
,
and
all
he
aims
at
.
I
know
not
that
I
especially
*NL*
needed
the
lesson
,
either
in
the
way
of
warning
or
rebuke
;
but
*NL*
at
any
rate
,
I
learned
it
thoroughly
:
nor
,
it
gives
me
pleasure
*NL*
to
reflect
,
did
the
truth
,
as
it
came
home
to
my
perception
,
*NL*
ever
cost
me
a
pang
,
or
require
to
be
thrown
off
in
a
sigh
.
In
*NL*
the
way
of
literary
talk
,
it
is
true
,
the
Naval
Officer
--
an
*NL*
excellent
fellow
,
who
came
into
the
office
with
me
,
and
went
out
*NL*
only
a
little
later
--
would
often
engage
me
in
a
discussion
about
*NL*
one
or
the
other
of
his
favourite
topics
,
Napoleon
or
*NL*
Shakespeare
.
The
Collector
's
junior
clerk
,
too
a
young
gentleman
*NL*
who
,
it
was
whispered
occasionally
covered
a
sheet
of
Uncle
*NL*
Sam
's
letter
paper
with
what
-LRB-
at
the
distance
of
a
few
yards
-RRB-
*NL*
looked
very
much
like
poetry
--
used
now
and
then
to
speak
to
me
*NL*
of
books
,
as
matters
with
which
I
might
possibly
be
conversant
.
*NL*
This
was
my
all
of
lettered
intercourse
;
and
it
was
quite
*NL*
sufficient
for
my
necessities
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
longer
seeking
nor
caring
that
my
name
should
be
blasoned
*NL*
abroad
on
title-pages
,
I
smiled
to
think
that
it
had
now
another
*NL*
kind
of
vogue
.
The
Custom-House
marker
imprinted
it
,
with
a
*NL*
stencil
and
black
paint
,
on
pepper-bags
,
and
baskets
of
anatto
,
*NL*
and
cigar-boxes
,
and
bales
of
all
kinds
of
dutiable
merchandise
,
*NL*
in
testimony
that
these
commodities
had
paid
the
impost
,
and
*NL*
gone
regularly
through
the
office
.
Borne
on
such
queer
vehicle
*NL*
of
fame
,
a
knowledge
of
my
existence
,
so
far
as
a
name
conveys
*NL*
it
,
was
carried
where
it
had
never
been
before
,
and
,
I
hope
,
*NL*
will
never
go
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
past
was
not
dead
.
Once
in
a
great
while
,
the
thoughts
*NL*
that
had
seemed
so
vital
and
so
active
,
yet
had
been
put
to
rest
*NL*
so
quietly
,
revived
again
.
One
of
the
most
remarkable
occasions
,
*NL*
when
the
habit
of
bygone
days
awoke
in
me
,
was
that
which
brings
*NL*
it
within
the
law
of
literary
propriety
to
offer
the
public
the
*NL*
sketch
which
I
am
now
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
storey
of
the
Custom-House
there
is
a
large
room
,
*NL*
in
which
the
brick-work
and
naked
rafters
have
never
been
*NL*
covered
with
panelling
and
plaster
.
The
edifice
--
originally
*NL*
projected
on
a
scale
adapted
to
the
old
commercial
enterprise
of
*NL*
the
port
,
and
with
an
idea
of
subsequent
prosperity
destined
*NL*
never
to
be
realized
--
contains
far
more
space
than
its
occupants
*NL*
know
what
to
do
with
.
This
airy
hall
,
therefore
,
over
the
*NL*
Collector
's
apartments
,
remains
unfinished
to
this
day
,
and
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
aged
cobwebs
that
festoon
its
dusky
beams
,
appears
*NL*
still
to
await
the
labour
of
the
carpenter
and
mason
.
At
one
end
*NL*
of
the
room
,
in
a
recess
,
were
a
number
of
barrels
piled
one
*NL*
upon
another
,
containing
bundles
of
official
documents
.
Large
*NL*
quantities
of
similar
rubbish
lay
lumbering
the
floor
.
It
was
*NL*
sorrowful
to
think
how
many
days
,
and
weeks
,
and
months
,
and
*NL*
years
of
toil
had
been
wasted
on
these
musty
papers
,
which
were
*NL*
now
only
an
encumbrance
on
earth
,
and
were
hidden
away
in
this
*NL*
forgotten
corner
,
never
more
to
be
glanced
at
by
human
eyes
.
But
*NL*
then
,
what
reams
of
other
manuscripts
--
filled
,
not
with
the
*NL*
dulness
of
official
formalities
,
but
with
the
thought
of
*NL*
inventive
brains
and
the
rich
effusion
of
deep
hearts
--
had
gone
*NL*
equally
to
oblivion
;
and
that
,
moreover
,
without
serving
a
*NL*
purpose
in
their
day
,
as
these
heaped-up
papers
had
,
*NL*
and
--
saddest
of
all
--
without
purchasing
for
their
writers
the
*NL*
comfortable
livelihood
which
the
clerks
of
the
Custom-House
had
*NL*
gained
by
these
worthless
scratchings
of
the
pen
.
Yet
not
*NL*
altogether
worthless
,
perhaps
,
as
materials
of
local
history
.
*NL*
Here
,
no
doubt
,
statistics
of
the
former
commerce
of
Salem
might
*NL*
be
discovered
,
and
memorials
of
her
princely
merchants
--
old
King
*NL*
Derby
--
old
Billy
Gray
--
old
Simon
Forrester
--
and
many
another
*NL*
magnate
in
his
day
,
whose
powdered
head
,
however
,
was
scarcely
*NL*
in
the
tomb
before
his
mountain
pile
of
wealth
began
to
dwindle
.
*NL*
The
founders
of
the
greater
part
of
the
families
which
now
*NL*
compose
the
aristocracy
of
Salem
might
here
be
traced
,
from
the
*NL*
petty
and
obscure
beginnings
of
their
traffic
,
at
periods
*NL*
generally
much
posterior
to
the
Revolution
,
upward
to
what
their
*NL*
children
look
upon
as
long-established
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prior
to
the
Revolution
there
is
a
dearth
of
records
;
the
*NL*
earlier
documents
and
archives
of
the
Custom-House
having
,
*NL*
probably
,
been
carried
off
to
Halifax
,
when
all
the
king
's
*NL*
officials
accompanied
the
British
army
in
its
flight
from
*NL*
Boston
.
It
has
often
been
a
matter
of
regret
with
me
;
for
,
going
*NL*
back
,
perhaps
,
to
the
days
of
the
Protectorate
,
those
papers
*NL*
must
have
contained
many
references
to
forgotten
or
remembered
*NL*
men
,
and
to
antique
customs
,
which
would
have
affected
me
with
*NL*
the
same
pleasure
as
when
I
used
to
pick
up
Indian
arrow-heads
*NL*
in
the
field
near
the
Old
Manse
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
one
idle
and
rainy
day
,
it
was
my
fortune
to
make
a
*NL*
discovery
of
some
little
interest
.
Poking
and
burrowing
into
the
*NL*
heaped-up
rubbish
in
the
corner
,
unfolding
one
and
another
*NL*
document
,
and
reading
the
names
of
vessels
that
had
long
ago
*NL*
foundered
at
sea
or
rotted
at
the
wharves
,
and
those
of
*NL*
merchants
never
heard
of
now
on
`
Change
,
nor
very
readily
*NL*
decipherable
on
their
mossy
tombstones
;
glancing
at
such
matters
*NL*
with
the
saddened
,
weary
,
half-reluctant
interest
which
we
*NL*
bestow
on
the
corpse
of
dead
activity
--
and
exerting
my
fancy
,
*NL*
sluggish
with
little
use
,
to
raise
up
from
these
dry
bones
an
*NL*
image
of
the
old
town
's
brighter
aspect
,
when
India
was
a
new
*NL*
region
,
and
only
Salem
knew
the
way
thither
--
I
chanced
to
lay
my
*NL*
hand
on
a
small
package
,
carefully
done
up
in
a
piece
of
ancient
*NL*
yellow
parchment
.
This
envelope
had
the
air
of
an
official
*NL*
record
of
some
period
long
past
,
when
clerks
engrossed
their
*NL*
stiff
and
formal
chirography
on
more
substantial
materials
than
*NL*
at
present
.
There
was
something
about
it
that
quickened
an
*NL*
instinctive
curiosity
,
and
made
me
undo
the
faded
red
tape
that
*NL*
tied
up
the
package
,
with
the
sense
that
a
treasure
would
here
*NL*
be
brought
to
light
.
Unbending
the
rigid
folds
of
the
parchment
*NL*
cover
,
I
found
it
to
be
a
commission
,
under
the
hand
and
seal
of
*NL*
Governor
Shirley
,
in
favour
of
one
Jonathan
Pue
,
as
Surveyor
of
*NL*
His
Majesty
's
Customs
for
the
Port
of
Salem
,
in
the
Province
of
*NL*
Massachusetts
Bay
.
I
remembered
to
have
read
-LRB-
probably
in
Felt
's
*NL*
``
Annals
''
-RRB-
a
notice
of
the
decease
of
Mr.
Surveyor
Pue
,
about
*NL*
fourscore
years
ago
;
and
likewise
,
in
a
newspaper
of
recent
*NL*
times
,
an
account
of
the
digging
up
of
his
remains
in
the
little
*NL*
graveyard
of
St.
Peter
's
Church
,
during
the
renewal
of
that
*NL*
edifice
.
Nothing
,
if
I
rightly
call
to
mind
,
was
left
of
my
*NL*
respected
predecessor
,
save
an
imperfect
skeleton
,
and
some
*NL*
fragments
of
apparel
,
and
a
wig
of
majestic
frizzle
,
which
,
*NL*
unlike
the
head
that
it
once
adorned
,
was
in
very
satisfactory
*NL*
preservation
.
But
,
on
examining
the
papers
which
the
parchment
*NL*
commission
served
to
envelop
,
I
found
more
traces
of
Mr.
Pue
's
*NL*
mental
part
,
and
the
internal
operations
of
his
head
,
than
the
*NL*
frizzled
wig
had
contained
of
the
venerable
skull
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
documents
,
in
short
,
not
official
,
but
of
a
private
*NL*
nature
,
or
,
at
least
,
written
in
his
private
capacity
,
and
*NL*
apparently
with
his
own
hand
.
I
could
account
for
their
being
*NL*
included
in
the
heap
of
Custom-House
lumber
only
by
the
fact
*NL*
that
Mr.
Pue
's
death
had
happened
suddenly
,
and
that
these
*NL*
papers
,
which
he
probably
kept
in
his
official
desk
,
had
never
*NL*
come
to
the
knowledge
of
his
heirs
,
or
were
supposed
to
relate
*NL*
to
the
business
of
the
revenue
.
On
the
transfer
of
the
archives
*NL*
to
Halifax
,
this
package
,
proving
to
be
of
no
public
concern
,
*NL*
was
left
behind
,
and
had
remained
ever
since
unopened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ancient
Surveyor
--
being
little
molested
,
I
suppose
,
at
that
*NL*
early
day
with
business
pertaining
to
his
office
--
seems
to
have
*NL*
devoted
some
of
his
many
leisure
hours
to
researches
as
a
local
*NL*
antiquarian
,
and
other
inquisitions
of
a
similar
nature
.
These
*NL*
supplied
material
for
petty
activity
to
a
mind
that
would
*NL*
otherwise
have
been
eaten
up
with
rust
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
portion
of
his
facts
,
by-the-by
,
did
me
good
service
in
the
*NL*
preparation
of
the
article
entitled
``
MAIN
STREET
,
''
included
in
*NL*
the
present
volume
.
The
remainder
may
perhaps
be
applied
to
*NL*
purposes
equally
valuable
hereafter
,
or
not
impossibly
may
be
*NL*
worked
up
,
so
far
as
they
go
,
into
a
regular
history
of
Salem
,
*NL*
should
my
veneration
for
the
natal
soil
ever
impel
me
to
so
*NL*
pious
a
task
.
Meanwhile
,
they
shall
be
at
the
command
of
any
*NL*
gentleman
,
inclined
and
competent
,
to
take
the
unprofitable
*NL*
labour
off
my
hands
.
As
a
final
disposition
I
contemplate
*NL*
depositing
them
with
the
Essex
Historical
Society
.
But
the
*NL*
object
that
most
drew
my
attention
to
the
mysterious
package
was
*NL*
a
certain
affair
of
fine
red
cloth
,
much
worn
and
faded
,
There
*NL*
were
traces
about
it
of
gold
embroidery
,
which
,
however
,
was
*NL*
greatly
frayed
and
defaced
,
so
that
none
,
or
very
little
,
of
the
*NL*
glitter
was
left
.
It
had
been
wrought
,
as
was
easy
to
perceive
,
*NL*
with
wonderful
skill
of
needlework
;
and
the
stitch
-LRB-
as
I
am
*NL*
assured
by
ladies
conversant
with
such
mysteries
-RRB-
gives
evidence
*NL*
of
a
now
forgotten
art
,
not
to
be
discovered
even
by
the
process
*NL*
of
picking
out
the
threads
.
This
rag
of
scarlet
cloth
--
for
time
,
*NL*
and
wear
,
and
a
sacrilegious
moth
had
reduced
it
to
little
other
*NL*
than
a
rag
--
on
careful
examination
,
assumed
the
shape
of
a
*NL*
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
capital
letter
A.
By
an
accurate
measurement
,
each
*NL*
limb
proved
to
be
precisely
three
inches
and
a
quarter
in
*NL*
length
.
It
had
been
intended
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
,
as
an
*NL*
ornamental
article
of
dress
;
but
how
it
was
to
be
worn
,
or
what
*NL*
rank
,
honour
,
and
dignity
,
in
by-past
times
,
were
signified
by
*NL*
it
,
was
a
riddle
which
-LRB-
so
evanescent
are
the
fashions
of
the
*NL*
world
in
these
particulars
-RRB-
I
saw
little
hope
of
solving
.
And
*NL*
yet
it
strangely
interested
me
.
My
eyes
fastened
themselves
upon
*NL*
the
old
scarlet
letter
,
and
would
not
be
turned
aside
.
Certainly
*NL*
there
was
some
deep
meaning
in
it
most
worthy
of
interpretation
,
*NL*
and
which
,
as
it
were
,
streamed
forth
from
the
mystic
symbol
,
*NL*
subtly
communicating
itself
to
my
sensibilities
,
but
evading
the
*NL*
analysis
of
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
thus
perplexed
--
and
cogitating
,
among
other
hypotheses
,
*NL*
whether
the
letter
might
not
have
been
one
of
those
decorations
*NL*
which
the
white
men
used
to
contrive
in
order
to
take
the
eyes
*NL*
of
Indians
--
I
happened
to
place
it
on
my
breast
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
me
--
the
reader
may
smile
,
but
must
not
doubt
my
word
--
it
seemed
*NL*
to
me
,
then
,
that
I
experienced
a
sensation
not
altogether
*NL*
physical
,
yet
almost
so
,
as
of
burning
heat
,
and
as
if
the
*NL*
letter
were
not
of
red
cloth
,
but
red-hot
iron
.
I
shuddered
,
*NL*
and
involuntarily
let
it
fall
upon
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
absorbing
contemplation
of
the
scarlet
letter
,
I
had
*NL*
hitherto
neglected
to
examine
a
small
roll
of
dingy
paper
,
*NL*
around
which
it
had
been
twisted
.
This
I
now
opened
,
and
had
the
*NL*
satisfaction
to
find
recorded
by
the
old
Surveyor
's
pen
,
a
*NL*
reasonably
complete
explanation
of
the
whole
affair
.
There
were
*NL*
several
foolscap
sheets
,
containing
many
particulars
respecting
*NL*
the
life
and
conversation
of
one
Hester
Prynne
,
who
appeared
to
*NL*
have
been
rather
a
noteworthy
personage
in
the
view
of
our
*NL*
ancestors
.
She
had
flourished
during
the
period
between
the
*NL*
early
days
of
Massachusetts
and
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
*NL*
century
.
Aged
persons
,
alive
in
the
time
of
Mr.
Surveyor
Pue
,
*NL*
and
from
whose
oral
testimony
he
had
made
up
his
narrative
,
*NL*
remembered
her
,
in
their
youth
,
as
a
very
old
,
but
not
decrepit
*NL*
woman
,
of
a
stately
and
solemn
aspect
.
It
had
been
her
habit
,
*NL*
from
an
almost
immemorial
date
,
to
go
about
the
country
as
a
*NL*
kind
of
voluntary
nurse
,
and
doing
whatever
miscellaneous
good
*NL*
she
might
;
taking
upon
herself
,
likewise
,
to
give
advice
in
all
*NL*
matters
,
especially
those
of
the
heart
,
by
which
means
--
as
a
*NL*
person
of
such
propensities
inevitably
must
--
she
gained
from
*NL*
many
people
the
reverence
due
to
an
angel
,
but
,
I
should
*NL*
imagine
,
was
looked
upon
by
others
as
an
intruder
and
a
*NL*
nuisance
.
Prying
further
into
the
manuscript
,
I
found
the
record
*NL*
of
other
doings
and
sufferings
of
this
singular
woman
,
for
most
*NL*
of
which
the
reader
is
referred
to
the
story
entitled
``
THE
*NL*
SCARLET
LETTER
''
;
and
it
should
be
borne
carefully
in
mind
that
*NL*
the
main
facts
of
that
story
are
authorized
and
authenticated
by
*NL*
the
document
of
Mr.
Surveyor
Pue
.
The
original
papers
,
together
*NL*
with
the
scarlet
letter
itself
--
a
most
curious
relic
--
are
still
*NL*
in
my
possession
,
and
shall
be
freely
exhibited
to
whomsoever
,
*NL*
induced
by
the
great
interest
of
the
narrative
,
may
desire
a
*NL*
sight
of
them
.
I
must
not
be
understood
affirming
that
,
in
the
*NL*
dressing
up
of
the
tale
,
and
imagining
the
motives
and
modes
of
*NL*
passion
that
influenced
the
characters
who
figure
in
it
,
I
have
*NL*
invariably
confined
myself
within
the
limits
of
the
old
*NL*
Surveyor
's
half-a-dozen
sheets
of
foolscap
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
*NL*
have
allowed
myself
,
as
to
such
points
,
nearly
,
or
altogether
,
*NL*
as
much
license
as
if
the
facts
had
been
entirely
of
my
own
*NL*
invention
.
What
I
contend
for
is
the
authenticity
of
the
*NL*
outline
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
incident
recalled
my
mind
,
in
some
degree
,
to
its
old
*NL*
track
.
There
seemed
to
be
here
the
groundwork
of
a
tale
.
It
*NL*
impressed
me
as
if
the
ancient
Surveyor
,
in
his
garb
of
a
*NL*
hundred
years
gone
by
,
and
wearing
his
immortal
wig
--
which
was
*NL*
buried
with
him
,
but
did
not
perish
in
the
grave
--
had
met
me
in
*NL*
the
deserted
chamber
of
the
Custom-House
.
In
his
port
was
the
*NL*
dignity
of
one
who
had
borne
His
Majesty
's
commission
,
and
who
*NL*
was
therefore
illuminated
by
a
ray
of
the
splendour
that
shone
*NL*
so
dazzlingly
about
the
throne
.
How
unlike
alas
the
hangdog
look
*NL*
of
a
republican
official
,
who
,
as
the
servant
of
the
people
,
*NL*
feels
himself
less
than
the
least
,
and
below
the
lowest
of
his
*NL*
masters
.
With
his
own
ghostly
hand
,
the
obscurely
seen
,
but
*NL*
majestic
,
figure
had
imparted
to
me
the
scarlet
symbol
and
the
*NL*
little
roll
of
explanatory
manuscript
.
With
his
own
ghostly
*NL*
voice
he
had
exhorted
me
,
on
the
sacred
consideration
of
my
*NL*
filial
duty
and
reverence
towards
him
--
who
might
reasonably
*NL*
regard
himself
as
my
official
ancestor
--
to
bring
his
mouldy
and
*NL*
moth-eaten
lucubrations
before
the
public
.
``
Do
this
,
''
said
the
*NL*
ghost
of
Mr.
Surveyor
Pue
,
emphatically
nodding
the
head
that
*NL*
looked
so
imposing
within
its
memorable
wig
;
``
do
this
,
and
the
*NL*
profit
shall
be
all
your
own
.
You
will
shortly
need
it
;
for
it
*NL*
is
not
in
your
days
as
it
was
in
mine
,
when
a
man
's
office
was
a
*NL*
life-lease
,
and
oftentimes
an
heirloom
.
But
I
charge
you
,
in
*NL*
this
matter
of
old
Mistress
Prynne
,
give
to
your
predecessor
's
*NL*
memory
the
credit
which
will
be
rightfully
due
''
And
I
said
to
*NL*
the
ghost
of
Mr.
Surveyor
Pue
--
``
I
will
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Hester
Prynne
's
story
,
therefore
,
I
bestowed
much
thought
.
*NL*
It
was
the
subject
of
my
meditations
for
many
an
hour
,
while
*NL*
pacing
to
and
fro
across
my
room
,
or
traversing
,
with
a
*NL*
hundredfold
repetition
,
the
long
extent
from
the
front
door
of
*NL*
the
Custom-House
to
the
side
entrance
,
and
back
again
.
Great
*NL*
were
the
weariness
and
annoyance
of
the
old
Inspector
and
the
*NL*
Weighers
and
Gaugers
,
whose
slumbers
were
disturbed
by
the
*NL*
unmercifully
lengthened
tramp
of
my
passing
and
returning
*NL*
footsteps
.
Remembering
their
own
former
habits
,
they
used
to
say
*NL*
that
the
Surveyor
was
walking
the
quarter-deck
.
They
probably
*NL*
fancied
that
my
sole
object
--
and
,
indeed
,
the
sole
object
for
*NL*
which
a
sane
man
could
ever
put
himself
into
voluntary
*NL*
motion
--
was
to
get
an
appetite
for
dinner
.
And
,
to
say
the
*NL*
truth
,
an
appetite
,
sharpened
by
the
east
wind
that
generally
*NL*
blew
along
the
passage
,
was
the
only
valuable
result
of
so
much
*NL*
indefatigable
exercise
.
So
little
adapted
is
the
atmosphere
of
a
*NL*
Custom-house
to
the
delicate
harvest
of
fancy
and
sensibility
,
*NL*
that
,
had
I
remained
there
through
ten
Presidencies
yet
to
come
,
*NL*
I
doubt
whether
the
tale
of
``
The
Scarlet
Letter
''
would
ever
have
*NL*
been
brought
before
the
public
eye
.
My
imagination
was
a
*NL*
tarnished
mirror
.
It
would
not
reflect
,
or
only
with
miserable
*NL*
dimness
,
the
figures
with
which
I
did
my
best
to
people
it
.
The
*NL*
characters
of
the
narrative
would
not
be
warmed
and
rendered
*NL*
malleable
by
any
heat
that
I
could
kindle
at
my
intellectual
*NL*
forge
.
They
would
take
neither
the
glow
of
passion
nor
the
*NL*
tenderness
of
sentiment
,
but
retained
all
the
rigidity
of
dead
*NL*
corpses
,
and
stared
me
in
the
face
with
a
fixed
and
ghastly
grin
*NL*
of
contemptuous
defiance
.
``
What
have
you
to
do
with
us
?
''
that
*NL*
expression
seemed
to
say
.
``
The
little
power
you
might
have
once
*NL*
possessed
over
the
tribe
of
unrealities
is
gone
!
You
have
*NL*
bartered
it
for
a
pittance
of
the
public
gold
.
Go
then
,
and
earn
*NL*
your
wages
!
''
In
short
,
the
almost
torpid
creatures
of
my
own
*NL*
fancy
twitted
me
with
imbecility
,
and
not
without
fair
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
merely
during
the
three
hours
and
a
half
which
Uncle
*NL*
Sam
claimed
as
his
share
of
my
daily
life
that
this
wretched
*NL*
numbness
held
possession
of
me
.
It
went
with
me
on
my
sea-shore
*NL*
walks
and
rambles
into
the
country
,
whenever
--
which
was
seldom
*NL*
and
reluctantly
--
I
bestirred
myself
to
seek
that
invigorating
*NL*
charm
of
Nature
which
used
to
give
me
such
freshness
and
*NL*
activity
of
thought
,
the
moment
that
I
stepped
across
the
*NL*
threshold
of
the
Old
Manse
.
The
same
torpor
,
as
regarded
the
*NL*
capacity
for
intellectual
effort
,
accompanied
me
home
,
and
*NL*
weighed
upon
me
in
the
chamber
which
I
most
absurdly
termed
my
*NL*
study
.
Nor
did
it
quit
me
when
,
late
at
night
,
I
sat
in
the
*NL*
deserted
parlour
,
lighted
only
by
the
glimmering
coal-fire
and
*NL*
the
moon
,
striving
to
picture
forth
imaginary
scenes
,
which
,
the
*NL*
next
day
,
might
flow
out
on
the
brightening
page
in
many-hued
*NL*
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
imaginative
faculty
refused
to
act
at
such
an
hour
,
it
*NL*
might
well
be
deemed
a
hopeless
case
.
Moonlight
,
in
a
familiar
*NL*
room
,
falling
so
white
upon
the
carpet
,
and
showing
all
its
*NL*
figures
so
distinctly
--
making
every
object
so
minutely
visible
,
*NL*
yet
so
unlike
a
morning
or
noontide
visibility
--
is
a
medium
the
*NL*
most
suitable
for
a
romance-writer
to
get
acquainted
with
his
*NL*
illusive
guests
.
There
is
the
little
domestic
scenery
of
the
*NL*
well-known
apartment
;
the
chairs
,
with
each
its
separate
*NL*
individuality
;
the
centre-table
,
sustaining
a
work-basket
,
a
*NL*
volume
or
two
,
and
an
extinguished
lamp
;
the
sofa
;
the
*NL*
book-case
;
the
picture
on
the
wall
--
all
these
details
,
so
*NL*
completely
seen
,
are
so
spiritualised
by
the
unusual
light
,
that
*NL*
they
seem
to
lose
their
actual
substance
,
and
become
things
of
*NL*
intellect
.
Nothing
is
too
small
or
too
trifling
to
undergo
this
*NL*
change
,
and
acquire
dignity
thereby
.
A
child
's
shoe
;
the
doll
,
*NL*
seated
in
her
little
wicker
carriage
;
the
hobby-horse
--
whatever
,
*NL*
in
a
word
,
has
been
used
or
played
with
during
the
day
is
now
*NL*
invested
with
a
quality
of
strangeness
and
remoteness
,
though
*NL*
still
almost
as
vividly
present
as
by
daylight
.
Thus
,
therefore
,
*NL*
the
floor
of
our
familiar
room
has
become
a
neutral
territory
,
*NL*
somewhere
between
the
real
world
and
fairy-land
,
where
the
*NL*
Actual
and
the
Imaginary
may
meet
,
and
each
imbue
itself
with
*NL*
the
nature
of
the
other
.
Ghosts
might
enter
here
without
*NL*
affrighting
us
.
It
would
be
too
much
in
keeping
with
the
scene
*NL*
to
excite
surprise
,
were
we
to
look
about
us
and
discover
a
*NL*
form
,
beloved
,
but
gone
hence
,
now
sitting
quietly
in
a
streak
*NL*
of
this
magic
moonshine
,
with
an
aspect
that
would
make
us
doubt
*NL*
whether
it
had
returned
from
afar
,
or
had
never
once
stirred
*NL*
from
our
fireside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
somewhat
dim
coal
fire
has
an
essential
Influence
in
*NL*
producing
the
effect
which
I
would
describe
.
It
throws
its
*NL*
unobtrusive
tinge
throughout
the
room
,
with
a
faint
ruddiness
*NL*
upon
the
walls
and
ceiling
,
and
a
reflected
gleam
upon
the
*NL*
polish
of
the
furniture
.
This
warmer
light
mingles
itself
with
*NL*
the
cold
spirituality
of
the
moon-beams
,
and
communicates
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
a
heart
and
sensibilities
of
human
tenderness
to
the
forms
*NL*
which
fancy
summons
up
.
It
converts
them
from
snow-images
into
*NL*
men
and
women
.
Glancing
at
the
looking-glass
,
we
behold
--
deep
*NL*
within
its
haunted
verge
--
the
smouldering
glow
of
the
*NL*
half-extinguished
anthracite
,
the
white
moon-beams
on
the
floor
,
*NL*
and
a
repetition
of
all
the
gleam
and
shadow
of
the
picture
,
*NL*
with
one
remove
further
from
the
actual
,
and
nearer
to
the
*NL*
imaginative
.
Then
,
at
such
an
hour
,
and
with
this
scene
before
*NL*
him
,
if
a
man
,
sitting
all
alone
,
can
not
dream
strange
things
,
*NL*
and
make
them
look
like
truth
,
he
need
never
try
to
write
*NL*
romances
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
for
myself
,
during
the
whole
of
my
Custom-House
experience
,
*NL*
moonlight
and
sunshine
,
and
the
glow
of
firelight
,
were
just
*NL*
alike
in
my
regard
;
and
neither
of
them
was
of
one
whit
more
*NL*
avail
than
the
twinkle
of
a
tallow-candle
.
An
entire
class
of
*NL*
susceptibilities
,
and
a
gift
connected
with
them
--
of
no
great
*NL*
richness
or
value
,
but
the
best
I
had
--
was
gone
from
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
my
belief
,
however
,
that
had
I
attempted
a
different
order
*NL*
of
composition
,
my
faculties
would
not
have
been
found
so
*NL*
pointless
and
inefficacious
.
I
might
,
for
instance
,
have
*NL*
contented
myself
with
writing
out
the
narratives
of
a
veteran
*NL*
shipmaster
,
one
of
the
Inspectors
,
whom
I
should
be
most
*NL*
ungrateful
not
to
mention
,
since
scarcely
a
day
passed
that
he
*NL*
did
not
stir
me
to
laughter
and
admiration
by
his
marvelous
*NL*
gifts
as
a
story-teller
.
Could
I
have
preserved
the
picturesque
*NL*
force
of
his
style
,
and
the
humourous
colouring
which
nature
*NL*
taught
him
how
to
throw
over
his
descriptions
,
the
result
,
I
*NL*
honestly
believe
,
would
have
been
something
new
in
literature
.
*NL*
Or
I
might
readily
have
found
a
more
serious
task
.
It
was
a
*NL*
folly
,
with
the
materiality
of
this
daily
life
pressing
so
*NL*
intrusively
upon
me
,
to
attempt
to
fling
myself
back
into
*NL*
another
age
,
or
to
insist
on
creating
the
semblance
of
a
world
*NL*
out
of
airy
matter
,
when
,
at
every
moment
,
the
impalpable
beauty
*NL*
of
my
soap-bubble
was
broken
by
the
rude
contact
of
some
actual
*NL*
circumstance
.
The
wiser
effort
would
have
been
to
diffuse
*NL*
thought
and
imagination
through
the
opaque
substance
of
to-day
,
*NL*
and
thus
to
make
it
a
bright
transparency
;
to
spiritualise
the
*NL*
burden
that
began
to
weigh
so
heavily
;
to
seek
,
resolutely
,
the
*NL*
true
and
indestructible
value
that
lay
hidden
in
the
petty
and
*NL*
wearisome
incidents
,
and
ordinary
characters
with
which
I
was
*NL*
now
conversant
.
The
fault
was
mine
.
The
page
of
life
that
was
*NL*
spread
out
before
me
seemed
dull
and
commonplace
only
because
I
*NL*
had
not
fathomed
its
deeper
import
.
A
better
book
than
I
shall
*NL*
ever
write
was
there
;
leaf
after
leaf
presenting
itself
to
me
,
*NL*
just
as
it
was
written
out
by
the
reality
of
the
flitting
hour
,
*NL*
and
vanishing
as
fast
as
written
,
only
because
my
brain
wanted
*NL*
the
insight
,
and
my
hand
the
cunning
,
to
transcribe
it
.
At
some
*NL*
future
day
,
it
may
be
,
I
shall
remember
a
few
scattered
*NL*
fragments
and
broken
paragraphs
,
and
write
them
down
,
and
find
*NL*
the
letters
turn
to
gold
upon
the
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
perceptions
had
come
too
late
.
At
the
Instant
,
I
was
only
*NL*
conscious
that
what
would
have
been
a
pleasure
once
was
now
a
*NL*
hopeless
toil
.
There
was
no
occasion
to
make
much
moan
about
*NL*
this
state
of
affairs
.
I
had
ceased
to
be
a
writer
of
tolerably
*NL*
poor
tales
and
essays
,
and
had
become
a
tolerably
good
Surveyor
*NL*
of
the
Customs
.
That
was
all
.
But
,
nevertheless
,
it
is
anything
*NL*
but
agreeable
to
be
haunted
by
a
suspicion
that
one
's
intellect
*NL*
is
dwindling
away
,
or
exhaling
,
without
your
consciousness
,
like
*NL*
ether
out
of
a
phial
;
so
that
,
at
every
glance
,
you
find
a
*NL*
smaller
and
less
volatile
residuum
.
Of
the
fact
there
could
be
*NL*
no
doubt
and
,
examining
myself
and
others
,
I
was
led
to
*NL*
conclusions
,
in
reference
to
the
effect
of
public
office
on
the
*NL*
character
,
not
very
favourable
to
the
mode
of
life
in
question
.
*NL*
In
some
other
form
,
perhaps
,
I
may
hereafter
develop
these
*NL*
effects
.
Suffice
it
here
to
say
that
a
Custom-House
officer
of
*NL*
long
continuance
can
hardly
be
a
very
praiseworthy
or
*NL*
respectable
personage
,
for
many
reasons
;
one
of
them
,
the
tenure
*NL*
by
which
he
holds
his
situation
,
and
another
,
the
very
nature
of
*NL*
his
business
,
which
--
though
,
I
trust
,
an
honest
one
--
is
of
such
*NL*
a
sort
that
he
does
not
share
in
the
united
effort
of
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
effect
--
which
I
believe
to
be
observable
,
more
or
less
,
in
*NL*
every
individual
who
has
occupied
the
position
--
is
,
that
while
*NL*
he
leans
on
the
mighty
arm
of
the
Republic
,
his
own
proper
*NL*
strength
departs
from
him
.
He
loses
,
in
an
extent
proportioned
*NL*
to
the
weakness
or
force
of
his
original
nature
,
the
capability
*NL*
of
self-support
.
If
he
possesses
an
unusual
share
of
native
*NL*
energy
,
or
the
enervating
magic
of
place
do
not
operate
too
long
*NL*
upon
him
,
his
forfeited
powers
may
be
redeemable
.
The
ejected
*NL*
officer
--
fortunate
in
the
unkindly
shove
that
sends
him
forth
*NL*
betimes
,
to
struggle
amid
a
struggling
world
--
may
return
to
*NL*
himself
,
and
become
all
that
he
has
ever
been
.
But
this
seldom
*NL*
happens
.
He
usually
keeps
his
ground
just
long
enough
for
his
*NL*
own
ruin
,
and
is
then
thrust
out
,
with
sinews
all
unstrung
,
to
*NL*
totter
along
the
difficult
footpath
of
life
as
he
best
may
.
*NL*
Conscious
of
his
own
infirmity
--
that
his
tempered
steel
and
*NL*
elasticity
are
lost
--
he
for
ever
afterwards
looks
wistfully
*NL*
about
him
in
quest
of
support
external
to
himself
.
His
pervading
*NL*
and
continual
hope
--
a
hallucination
,
which
,
in
the
face
of
all
*NL*
discouragement
,
and
making
light
of
impossibilities
,
haunts
him
*NL*
while
he
lives
,
and
,
I
fancy
,
like
the
convulsive
throes
of
the
*NL*
cholera
,
torments
him
for
a
brief
space
after
death
--
is
,
that
*NL*
finally
,
and
in
no
long
time
,
by
some
happy
coincidence
of
*NL*
circumstances
,
he
shall
be
restored
to
office
.
This
faith
,
more
*NL*
than
anything
else
,
steals
the
pith
and
availability
out
of
*NL*
whatever
enterprise
he
may
dream
of
undertaking
.
Why
should
he
*NL*
toil
and
moil
,
and
be
at
so
much
trouble
to
pick
himself
up
out
*NL*
of
the
mud
,
when
,
in
a
little
while
hence
,
the
strong
arm
of
his
*NL*
Uncle
will
raise
and
support
him
?
Why
should
he
work
for
his
*NL*
living
here
,
or
go
to
dig
gold
in
California
,
when
he
is
so
soon
*NL*
to
be
made
happy
,
at
monthly
intervals
,
with
a
little
pile
of
*NL*
glittering
coin
out
of
his
Uncle
's
pocket
?
It
is
sadly
curious
*NL*
to
observe
how
slight
a
taste
of
office
suffices
to
infect
a
*NL*
poor
fellow
with
this
singular
disease
.
Uncle
Sam
's
*NL*
gold
--
meaning
no
disrespect
to
the
worthy
old
gentleman
--
has
,
in
*NL*
this
respect
,
a
quality
of
enchantment
like
that
of
the
devil
's
*NL*
wages
.
Whoever
touches
it
should
look
well
to
himself
,
or
he
may
*NL*
find
the
bargain
to
go
hard
against
him
,
involving
,
if
not
his
*NL*
soul
,
yet
many
of
its
better
attributes
;
its
sturdy
force
,
its
*NL*
courage
and
constancy
,
its
truth
,
its
self-reliance
,
and
all
*NL*
that
gives
the
emphasis
to
manly
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
fine
prospect
in
the
distance
.
Not
that
the
Surveyor
*NL*
brought
the
lesson
home
to
himself
,
or
admitted
that
he
could
be
*NL*
so
utterly
undone
,
either
by
continuance
in
office
or
ejectment
.
*NL*
Yet
my
reflections
were
not
the
most
comfortable
.
I
began
to
*NL*
grow
melancholy
and
restless
;
continually
prying
into
my
mind
,
*NL*
to
discover
which
of
its
poor
properties
were
gone
,
and
what
*NL*
degree
of
detriment
had
already
accrued
to
the
remainder
.
I
*NL*
endeavoured
to
calculate
how
much
longer
I
could
stay
in
the
*NL*
Custom-House
,
and
yet
go
forth
a
man
.
To
confess
the
truth
,
it
*NL*
was
my
greatest
apprehension
--
as
it
would
never
be
a
measure
of
*NL*
policy
to
turn
out
so
quiet
an
individual
as
myself
;
and
it
*NL*
being
hardly
in
the
nature
of
a
public
officer
to
resign
--
it
was
*NL*
my
chief
trouble
,
therefore
,
that
I
was
likely
to
grow
grey
and
*NL*
decrepit
in
the
Surveyorship
,
and
become
much
such
another
*NL*
animal
as
the
old
Inspector
.
Might
it
not
,
in
the
tedious
lapse
*NL*
of
official
life
that
lay
before
me
,
finally
be
with
me
as
it
*NL*
was
with
this
venerable
friend
--
to
make
the
dinner-hour
the
*NL*
nucleus
of
the
day
,
and
to
spend
the
rest
of
it
,
as
an
old
dog
*NL*
spends
it
,
asleep
in
the
sunshine
or
in
the
shade
?
A
dreary
*NL*
look-forward
,
this
,
for
a
man
who
felt
it
to
be
the
best
*NL*
definition
of
happiness
to
live
throughout
the
whole
range
of
*NL*
his
faculties
and
sensibilities
.
But
,
all
this
while
,
I
was
*NL*
giving
myself
very
unnecessary
alarm
.
Providence
had
meditated
*NL*
better
things
for
me
than
I
could
possibly
imagine
for
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
remarkable
event
of
the
third
year
of
my
Surveyorship
--
to
*NL*
adopt
the
tone
of
``
P.
P.
''
--
was
the
election
of
General
Taylor
*NL*
to
the
Presidency
.
It
is
essential
,
in
order
to
form
a
complete
*NL*
estimate
of
the
advantages
of
official
life
,
to
view
the
*NL*
incumbent
at
the
in-coming
of
a
hostile
administration
.
His
*NL*
position
is
then
one
of
the
most
singularly
irksome
,
and
,
in
*NL*
every
contingency
,
disagreeable
,
that
a
wretched
mortal
can
*NL*
possibly
occupy
;
with
seldom
an
alternative
of
good
on
either
*NL*
hand
,
although
what
presents
itself
to
him
as
the
worst
event
*NL*
may
very
probably
be
the
best
.
But
it
is
a
strange
experience
,
*NL*
to
a
man
of
pride
and
sensibility
,
to
know
that
his
interests
*NL*
are
within
the
control
of
individuals
who
neither
love
nor
*NL*
understand
him
,
and
by
whom
,
since
one
or
the
other
must
needs
*NL*
happen
,
he
would
rather
be
injured
than
obliged
.
Strange
,
too
,
*NL*
for
one
who
has
kept
his
calmness
throughout
the
contest
,
to
*NL*
observe
the
bloodthirstiness
that
is
developed
in
the
hour
of
*NL*
triumph
,
and
to
be
conscious
that
he
is
himself
among
its
*NL*
objects
!
There
are
few
uglier
traits
of
human
nature
than
this
*NL*
tendency
--
which
I
now
witnessed
in
men
no
worse
than
their
*NL*
neighbours
--
to
grow
cruel
,
merely
because
they
possessed
the
*NL*
power
of
inflicting
harm
.
If
the
guillotine
,
as
applied
to
*NL*
office-holders
,
were
a
literal
fact
,
instead
of
one
of
the
most
*NL*
apt
of
metaphors
,
it
is
my
sincere
belief
that
the
active
*NL*
members
of
the
victorious
party
were
sufficiently
excited
to
*NL*
have
chopped
off
all
our
heads
,
and
have
thanked
Heaven
for
the
*NL*
opportunity
!
It
appears
to
me
--
who
have
been
a
calm
and
curious
*NL*
observer
,
as
well
in
victory
as
defeat
--
that
this
fierce
and
*NL*
bitter
spirit
of
malice
and
revenge
has
never
distinguished
the
*NL*
many
triumphs
of
my
own
party
as
it
now
did
that
of
the
Whigs
.
*NL*
The
Democrats
take
the
offices
,
as
a
general
rule
,
because
they
*NL*
need
them
,
and
because
the
practice
of
many
years
has
made
it
*NL*
the
law
of
political
warfare
,
which
unless
a
different
system
be
*NL*
proclaimed
,
it
was
weakness
and
cowardice
to
murmur
at
.
But
the
*NL*
long
habit
of
victory
has
made
them
generous
.
They
know
how
to
*NL*
spare
when
they
see
occasion
;
and
when
they
strike
,
the
axe
may
*NL*
be
sharp
indeed
,
but
its
edge
is
seldom
poisoned
with
ill-will
;
*NL*
nor
is
it
their
custom
ignominiously
to
kick
the
head
which
they
*NL*
have
just
struck
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
unpleasant
as
was
my
predicament
,
at
best
,
I
saw
much
*NL*
reason
to
congratulate
myself
that
I
was
on
the
losing
side
*NL*
rather
than
the
triumphant
one
.
If
,
heretofore
,
I
had
been
none
*NL*
of
the
warmest
of
partisans
I
began
now
,
at
this
season
of
peril
*NL*
and
adversity
,
to
be
pretty
acutely
sensible
with
which
party
my
*NL*
predilections
lay
;
nor
was
it
without
something
like
regret
and
*NL*
shame
that
,
according
to
a
reasonable
calculation
of
chances
,
I
*NL*
saw
my
own
prospect
of
retaining
office
to
be
better
than
those
*NL*
of
my
democratic
brethren
.
But
who
can
see
an
inch
into
futurity
*NL*
beyond
his
nose
?
My
own
head
was
the
first
that
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
when
a
man
's
head
drops
off
is
seldom
or
never
,
I
am
*NL*
inclined
to
think
,
precisely
the
most
agreeable
of
his
life
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
like
the
greater
part
of
our
misfortunes
,
even
so
*NL*
serious
a
contingency
brings
its
remedy
and
consolation
with
it
,
*NL*
if
the
sufferer
will
but
make
the
best
rather
than
the
worst
,
of
*NL*
the
accident
which
has
befallen
him
.
In
my
particular
case
the
*NL*
consolatory
topics
were
close
at
hand
,
and
,
indeed
,
had
*NL*
suggested
themselves
to
my
meditations
a
considerable
time
*NL*
before
it
was
requisite
to
use
them
.
In
view
of
my
previous
*NL*
weariness
of
office
,
and
vague
thoughts
of
resignation
,
my
*NL*
fortune
somewhat
resembled
that
of
a
person
who
should
entertain
*NL*
an
idea
of
committing
suicide
,
and
although
beyond
his
hopes
,
*NL*
meet
with
the
good
hap
to
be
murdered
.
In
the
Custom-House
,
as
*NL*
before
in
the
Old
Manse
,
I
had
spent
three
years
--
a
term
long
*NL*
enough
to
rest
a
weary
brain
:
long
enough
to
break
off
old
*NL*
intellectual
habits
,
and
make
room
for
new
ones
:
long
enough
,
*NL*
and
too
long
,
to
have
lived
in
an
unnatural
state
,
doing
what
*NL*
was
really
of
no
advantage
nor
delight
to
any
human
being
,
and
*NL*
withholding
myself
from
toil
that
would
,
at
least
,
have
stilled
*NL*
an
unquiet
impulse
in
me
.
Then
,
moreover
,
as
regarded
his
*NL*
unceremonious
ejectment
,
the
late
Surveyor
was
not
altogether
*NL*
ill-pleased
to
be
recognised
by
the
Whigs
as
an
enemy
;
since
his
*NL*
inactivity
in
political
affairs
--
his
tendency
to
roam
,
at
will
,
*NL*
in
that
broad
and
quiet
field
where
all
mankind
may
meet
,
rather
*NL*
than
confine
himself
to
those
narrow
paths
where
brethren
of
the
*NL*
same
household
must
diverge
from
one
another
--
had
sometimes
made
*NL*
it
questionable
with
his
brother
Democrats
whether
he
was
a
*NL*
friend
.
Now
,
after
he
had
won
the
crown
of
martyrdom
-LRB-
though
*NL*
with
no
longer
a
head
to
wear
it
on
-RRB-
,
the
point
might
be
looked
*NL*
upon
as
settled
.
Finally
,
little
heroic
as
he
was
,
it
seemed
*NL*
more
decorous
to
be
overthrown
in
the
downfall
of
the
party
with
*NL*
which
he
had
been
content
to
stand
than
to
remain
a
forlorn
*NL*
survivor
,
when
so
many
worthier
men
were
falling
:
and
at
last
,
*NL*
after
subsisting
for
four
years
on
the
mercy
of
a
hostile
*NL*
administration
,
to
be
compelled
then
to
define
his
position
*NL*
anew
,
and
claim
the
yet
more
humiliating
mercy
of
a
friendly
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
press
had
taken
up
my
affair
,
and
kept
me
for
a
*NL*
week
or
two
careering
through
the
public
prints
,
in
my
*NL*
decapitated
state
,
like
Irving
's
Headless
Horseman
,
ghastly
and
*NL*
grim
,
and
longing
to
be
buried
,
as
a
political
dead
man
ought
.
*NL*
So
much
for
my
figurative
self
.
The
real
human
being
all
this
*NL*
time
,
with
his
head
safely
on
his
shoulders
,
had
brought
himself
*NL*
to
the
comfortable
conclusion
that
everything
was
for
the
best
;
*NL*
and
making
an
investment
in
ink
,
paper
,
and
steel
pens
,
had
*NL*
opened
his
long-disused
writing
desk
,
and
was
again
a
literary
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
was
that
the
lucubrations
of
my
ancient
predecessor
,
Mr.
*NL*
Surveyor
Pue
,
came
into
play
.
Rusty
through
long
idleness
,
some
*NL*
little
space
was
requisite
before
my
intellectual
machinery
*NL*
could
be
brought
to
work
upon
the
tale
with
an
effect
in
any
*NL*
degree
satisfactory
.
Even
yet
,
though
my
thoughts
were
*NL*
ultimately
much
absorbed
in
the
task
,
it
wears
,
to
my
eye
,
a
*NL*
stern
and
sombre
aspect
:
too
much
ungladdened
by
genial
*NL*
sunshine
;
too
little
relieved
by
the
tender
and
familiar
*NL*
influences
which
soften
almost
every
scene
of
nature
and
real
*NL*
life
,
and
undoubtedly
should
soften
every
picture
of
them
.
This
*NL*
uncaptivating
effect
is
perhaps
due
to
the
period
of
hardly
*NL*
accomplished
revolution
,
and
still
seething
turmoil
,
in
which
*NL*
the
story
shaped
itself
.
It
is
no
indication
,
however
,
of
a
lack
*NL*
of
cheerfulness
in
the
writer
's
mind
:
for
he
was
happier
while
*NL*
straying
through
the
gloom
of
these
sunless
fantasies
than
at
*NL*
any
time
since
he
had
quitted
the
Old
Manse
.
Some
of
the
briefer
*NL*
articles
,
which
contribute
to
make
up
the
volume
,
have
likewise
*NL*
been
written
since
my
involuntary
withdrawal
from
the
toils
and
*NL*
honours
of
public
life
,
and
the
remainder
are
gleaned
from
*NL*
annuals
and
magazines
,
of
such
antique
date
,
that
they
have
gone
*NL*
round
the
circle
,
and
come
back
to
novelty
again
.
Keeping
up
the
*NL*
metaphor
of
the
political
guillotine
,
the
whole
may
be
*NL*
considered
as
the
POSTHUMOUS
PAPERS
OF
A
DECAPITATED
SURVEYOR
:
*NL*
and
the
sketch
which
I
am
now
bringing
to
a
close
,
if
too
*NL*
autobiographical
for
a
modest
person
to
publish
in
his
lifetime
,
*NL*
will
readily
be
excused
in
a
gentleman
who
writes
from
beyond
*NL*
the
grave
.
Peace
be
with
all
the
world
!
My
blessing
on
my
*NL*
friends
!
My
forgiveness
to
my
enemies
!
For
I
am
in
the
realm
of
*NL*
quiet
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
life
of
the
Custom-House
lies
like
a
dream
behind
me
.
The
*NL*
old
Inspector
--
who
,
by-the-bye
,
I
regret
to
say
,
was
overthrown
*NL*
and
killed
by
a
horse
some
time
ago
,
else
he
would
certainly
*NL*
have
lived
for
ever
--
he
,
and
all
those
other
venerable
*NL*
personages
who
sat
with
him
at
the
receipt
of
custom
,
are
but
*NL*
shadows
in
my
view
:
white-headed
and
wrinkled
images
,
which
my
*NL*
fancy
used
to
sport
with
,
and
has
now
flung
aside
for
ever
.
The
*NL*
merchants
--
Pingree
,
Phillips
,
Shepard
,
Upton
,
Kimball
,
Bertram
,
*NL*
Hunt
--
these
and
many
other
names
,
which
had
such
classic
*NL*
familiarity
for
my
ear
six
months
ago
,
--
these
men
of
traffic
,
*NL*
who
seemed
to
occupy
so
important
a
position
in
the
world
--
how
*NL*
little
time
has
it
required
to
disconnect
me
from
them
all
,
not
*NL*
merely
in
act
,
but
recollection
!
It
is
with
an
effort
that
I
*NL*
recall
the
figures
and
appellations
of
these
few
.
Soon
,
*NL*
likewise
,
my
old
native
town
will
loom
upon
me
through
the
haze
*NL*
of
memory
,
a
mist
brooding
over
and
around
it
;
as
if
it
were
no
*NL*
portion
of
the
real
earth
,
but
an
overgrown
village
in
*NL*
cloud-land
,
with
only
imaginary
inhabitants
to
people
its
wooden
*NL*
houses
and
walk
its
homely
lanes
,
and
the
unpicturesque
*NL*
prolixity
of
its
main
street
.
Henceforth
it
ceases
to
be
a
*NL*
reality
of
my
life
;
I
am
a
citizen
of
somewhere
else
.
My
good
*NL*
townspeople
will
not
much
regret
me
,
for
--
though
it
has
been
as
*NL*
dear
an
object
as
any
,
in
my
literary
efforts
,
to
be
of
some
*NL*
importance
in
their
eyes
,
and
to
win
myself
a
pleasant
memory
in
*NL*
this
abode
and
burial-place
of
so
many
of
my
forefathers
--
there
*NL*
has
never
been
,
for
me
,
the
genial
atmosphere
which
a
literary
*NL*
man
requires
in
order
to
ripen
the
best
harvest
of
his
mind
.
I
*NL*
shall
do
better
amongst
other
faces
;
and
these
familiar
ones
,
it
*NL*
need
hardly
be
said
,
will
do
just
as
well
without
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
,
however
--
oh
,
transporting
and
triumphant
*NL*
thought
--
that
the
great-grandchildren
of
the
present
race
may
*NL*
sometimes
think
kindly
of
the
scribbler
of
bygone
days
,
when
the
*NL*
antiquary
of
days
to
come
,
among
the
sites
memorable
in
the
*NL*
town
's
history
,
shall
point
out
the
locality
of
THE
TOWN
PUMP
.

THE
SCARLET
LETTER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
.
THE
PRISON
DOOR
*NL*
*NL*
A
throng
of
bearded
men
,
in
sad-coloured
garments
and
grey
*NL*
steeple-crowned
hats
,
inter-mixed
with
women
,
some
wearing
*NL*
hoods
,
and
others
bareheaded
,
was
assembled
in
front
of
a
wooden
*NL*
edifice
,
the
door
of
which
was
heavily
timbered
with
oak
,
and
*NL*
studded
with
iron
spikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
founders
of
a
new
colony
,
whatever
Utopia
of
human
virtue
*NL*
and
happiness
they
might
originally
project
,
have
invariably
*NL*
recognised
it
among
their
earliest
practical
necessities
to
*NL*
allot
a
portion
of
the
virgin
soil
as
a
cemetery
,
and
another
*NL*
portion
as
the
site
of
a
prison
.
In
accordance
with
this
rule
it
*NL*
may
safely
be
assumed
that
the
forefathers
of
Boston
had
built
*NL*
the
first
prison-house
somewhere
in
the
Vicinity
of
Cornhill
,
*NL*
almost
as
seasonably
as
they
marked
out
the
first
burial-ground
,
*NL*
on
Isaac
Johnson
's
lot
,
and
round
about
his
grave
,
which
*NL*
subsequently
became
the
nucleus
of
all
the
congregated
*NL*
sepulchres
in
the
old
churchyard
of
King
's
Chapel
.
Certain
it
is
*NL*
that
,
some
fifteen
or
twenty
years
after
the
settlement
of
the
*NL*
town
,
the
wooden
jail
was
already
marked
with
weather-stains
and
*NL*
other
indications
of
age
,
which
gave
a
yet
darker
aspect
to
its
*NL*
beetle-browed
and
gloomy
front
.
The
rust
on
the
ponderous
*NL*
iron-work
of
its
oaken
door
looked
more
antique
than
anything
*NL*
else
in
the
New
World
.
Like
all
that
pertains
to
crime
,
it
*NL*
seemed
never
to
have
known
a
youthful
era
.
Before
this
ugly
*NL*
edifice
,
and
between
it
and
the
wheel-track
of
the
street
,
was
a
*NL*
grass-plot
,
much
overgrown
with
burdock
,
pig-weed
,
apple-pern
,
*NL*
and
such
unsightly
vegetation
,
which
evidently
found
something
*NL*
congenial
in
the
soil
that
had
so
early
borne
the
black
flower
*NL*
of
civilised
society
,
a
prison
.
But
on
one
side
of
the
portal
,
*NL*
and
rooted
almost
at
the
threshold
,
was
a
wild
rose-bush
,
*NL*
covered
,
in
this
month
of
June
,
with
its
delicate
gems
,
which
*NL*
might
be
imagined
to
offer
their
fragrance
and
fragile
beauty
to
*NL*
the
prisoner
as
he
went
in
,
and
to
the
condemned
criminal
as
he
*NL*
came
forth
to
his
doom
,
in
token
that
the
deep
heart
of
Nature
*NL*
could
pity
and
be
kind
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
rose-bush
,
by
a
strange
chance
,
has
been
kept
alive
in
*NL*
history
;
but
whether
it
had
merely
survived
out
of
the
stern
old
*NL*
wilderness
,
so
long
after
the
fall
of
the
gigantic
pines
and
*NL*
oaks
that
originally
overshadowed
it
,
or
whether
,
as
there
is
*NL*
fair
authority
for
believing
,
it
had
sprung
up
under
the
*NL*
footsteps
of
the
sainted
Ann
Hutchinson
as
she
entered
the
*NL*
prison-door
,
we
shall
not
take
upon
us
to
determine
.
Finding
it
*NL*
so
directly
on
the
threshold
of
our
narrative
,
which
is
now
*NL*
about
to
issue
from
that
inauspicious
portal
,
we
could
hardly
do
*NL*
otherwise
than
pluck
one
of
its
flowers
,
and
present
it
to
the
*NL*
reader
.
It
may
serve
,
let
us
hope
,
to
symbolise
some
sweet
moral
*NL*
blossom
that
may
be
found
along
the
track
,
or
relieve
the
*NL*
darkening
close
of
a
tale
of
human
frailty
and
sorrow
.

II
.
THE
MARKET-PLACE
*NL*
*NL*
The
grass-plot
before
the
jail
,
in
Prison
Lane
,
on
a
certain
*NL*
summer
morning
,
not
less
than
two
centuries
ago
,
was
occupied
by
*NL*
a
pretty
large
number
of
the
inhabitants
of
Boston
,
all
with
*NL*
their
eyes
intently
fastened
on
the
iron-clamped
oaken
door
.
*NL*
Amongst
any
other
population
,
or
at
a
later
period
in
the
*NL*
history
of
New
England
,
the
grim
rigidity
that
petrified
the
*NL*
bearded
physiognomies
of
these
good
people
would
have
augured
*NL*
some
awful
business
in
hand
.
It
could
have
betokened
nothing
*NL*
short
of
the
anticipated
execution
of
some
noted
culprit
,
on
*NL*
whom
the
sentence
of
a
legal
tribunal
had
but
confirmed
the
*NL*
verdict
of
public
sentiment
.
But
,
in
that
early
severity
of
the
*NL*
Puritan
character
,
an
inference
of
this
kind
could
not
so
*NL*
indubitably
be
drawn
.
It
might
be
that
a
sluggish
bond-servant
,
*NL*
or
an
undutiful
child
,
whom
his
parents
had
given
over
to
the
*NL*
civil
authority
,
was
to
be
corrected
at
the
whipping-post
.
It
*NL*
might
be
that
an
Antinomian
,
a
Quaker
,
or
other
heterodox
*NL*
religionist
,
was
to
be
scourged
out
of
the
town
,
or
an
idle
or
*NL*
vagrant
Indian
,
whom
the
white
man
's
firewater
had
made
riotous
*NL*
about
the
streets
,
was
to
be
driven
with
stripes
into
the
shadow
*NL*
of
the
forest
.
It
might
be
,
too
,
that
a
witch
,
like
old
Mistress
*NL*
Hibbins
,
the
bitter-tempered
widow
of
the
magistrate
,
was
to
die
*NL*
upon
the
gallows
.
In
either
case
,
there
was
very
much
the
same
*NL*
solemnity
of
demeanour
on
the
part
of
the
spectators
,
as
*NL*
befitted
a
people
among
whom
religion
and
law
were
almost
*NL*
identical
,
and
in
whose
character
both
were
so
thoroughly
*NL*
interfused
,
that
the
mildest
and
severest
acts
of
public
*NL*
discipline
were
alike
made
venerable
and
awful
.
Meagre
,
indeed
,
*NL*
and
cold
,
was
the
sympathy
that
a
transgressor
might
look
for
,
*NL*
from
such
bystanders
,
at
the
scaffold
.
On
the
other
hand
,
a
*NL*
penalty
which
,
in
our
days
,
would
infer
a
degree
of
mocking
*NL*
infamy
and
ridicule
,
might
then
be
invested
with
almost
as
stern
*NL*
a
dignity
as
the
punishment
of
death
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
circumstance
to
be
noted
on
the
summer
morning
when
our
*NL*
story
begins
its
course
,
that
the
women
,
of
whom
there
were
*NL*
several
in
the
crowd
,
appeared
to
take
a
peculiar
interest
in
*NL*
whatever
penal
infliction
might
be
expected
to
ensue
.
The
age
*NL*
had
not
so
much
refinement
,
that
any
sense
of
impropriety
*NL*
restrained
the
wearers
of
petticoat
and
farthingale
from
*NL*
stepping
forth
into
the
public
ways
,
and
wedging
their
not
*NL*
unsubstantial
persons
,
if
occasion
were
,
into
the
throng
nearest
*NL*
to
the
scaffold
at
an
execution
.
Morally
,
as
well
as
materially
,
*NL*
there
was
a
coarser
fibre
in
those
wives
and
maidens
of
old
*NL*
English
birth
and
breeding
than
in
their
fair
descendants
,
*NL*
separated
from
them
by
a
series
of
six
or
seven
generations
;
*NL*
for
,
throughout
that
chain
of
ancestry
,
every
successive
mother
*NL*
had
transmitted
to
her
child
a
fainter
bloom
,
a
more
delicate
*NL*
and
briefer
beauty
,
and
a
slighter
physical
frame
,
if
not
*NL*
character
of
less
force
and
solidity
than
her
own
.
The
women
who
*NL*
were
now
standing
about
the
prison-door
stood
within
less
than
*NL*
half
a
century
of
the
period
when
the
man-like
Elizabeth
had
*NL*
been
the
not
altogether
unsuitable
representative
of
the
sex
.
*NL*
They
were
her
countrywomen
:
and
the
beef
and
ale
of
their
native
*NL*
land
,
with
a
moral
diet
not
a
whit
more
refined
,
entered
largely
*NL*
into
their
composition
.
The
bright
morning
sun
,
therefore
,
shone
*NL*
on
broad
shoulders
and
well-developed
busts
,
and
on
round
and
*NL*
ruddy
cheeks
,
that
had
ripened
in
the
far-off
island
,
and
had
*NL*
hardly
yet
grown
paler
or
thinner
in
the
atmosphere
of
New
*NL*
England
.
There
was
,
moreover
,
a
boldness
and
rotundity
of
speech
*NL*
among
these
matrons
,
as
most
of
them
seemed
to
be
,
that
would
*NL*
startle
us
at
the
present
day
,
whether
in
respect
to
its
purport
*NL*
or
its
volume
of
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodwives
,
''
said
a
hard-featured
dame
of
fifty
,
``
I
'll
tell
ye
a
*NL*
piece
of
my
mind
.
It
would
be
greatly
for
the
public
behoof
if
*NL*
we
women
,
being
of
mature
age
and
church-members
in
good
repute
,
*NL*
should
have
the
handling
of
such
malefactresses
as
this
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
.
What
think
ye
,
gossips
?
If
the
hussy
stood
up
for
*NL*
judgment
before
us
five
,
that
are
now
here
in
a
knot
together
,
*NL*
would
she
come
off
with
such
a
sentence
as
the
worshipful
*NL*
magistrates
have
awarded
?
Marry
,
I
trow
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
say
,
''
said
another
,
``
that
the
Reverend
Master
*NL*
Dimmesdale
,
her
godly
pastor
,
takes
it
very
grievously
to
heart
*NL*
that
such
a
scandal
should
have
come
upon
his
congregation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
magistrates
are
God-fearing
gentlemen
,
but
merciful
*NL*
overmuch
--
that
is
a
truth
,
''
added
a
third
autumnal
matron
.
``
At
*NL*
the
very
least
,
they
should
have
put
the
brand
of
a
hot
iron
on
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
's
forehead
.
Madame
Hester
would
have
winced
at
*NL*
that
,
I
warrant
me
.
But
she
--
the
naughty
baggage
--
little
will
*NL*
she
care
what
they
put
upon
the
bodice
of
her
gown
!
Why
,
look
*NL*
you
,
she
may
cover
it
with
a
brooch
,
or
such
like
heathenish
*NL*
adornment
,
and
so
walk
the
streets
as
brave
as
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
,
''
interposed
,
more
softly
,
a
young
wife
,
holding
a
*NL*
child
by
the
hand
,
``
let
her
cover
the
mark
as
she
will
,
the
pang
*NL*
of
it
will
be
always
in
her
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
we
talk
of
marks
and
brands
,
whether
on
the
bodice
of
*NL*
her
gown
or
the
flesh
of
her
forehead
?
''
cried
another
female
,
*NL*
the
ugliest
as
well
as
the
most
pitiless
of
these
*NL*
self-constituted
judges
.
``
This
woman
has
brought
shame
upon
us
*NL*
all
,
and
ought
to
die
;
is
there
not
law
for
it
?
Truly
there
is
,
*NL*
both
in
the
Scripture
and
the
statute-book
.
Then
let
the
*NL*
magistrates
,
who
have
made
it
of
no
effect
,
thank
themselves
if
*NL*
their
own
wives
and
daughters
go
astray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
us
,
goodwife
!
''
exclaimed
a
man
in
the
crowd
,
``
is
there
*NL*
no
virtue
in
woman
,
save
what
springs
from
a
wholesome
fear
of
*NL*
the
gallows
?
That
is
the
hardest
word
yet
!
Hush
now
,
gossips
for
*NL*
the
lock
is
turning
in
the
prison-door
,
and
here
comes
Mistress
*NL*
Prynne
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
jail
being
flung
open
from
within
there
*NL*
appeared
,
in
the
first
place
,
like
a
black
shadow
emerging
into
*NL*
sunshine
,
the
grim
and
grisly
presence
of
the
town-beadle
,
with
*NL*
a
sword
by
his
side
,
and
his
staff
of
office
in
his
hand
.
This
*NL*
personage
prefigured
and
represented
in
his
aspect
the
whole
*NL*
dismal
severity
of
the
Puritanic
code
of
law
,
which
it
was
his
*NL*
business
to
administer
in
its
final
and
closest
application
to
*NL*
the
offender
.
Stretching
forth
the
official
staff
in
his
left
*NL*
hand
,
he
laid
his
right
upon
the
shoulder
of
a
young
woman
,
whom
*NL*
he
thus
drew
forward
,
until
,
on
the
threshold
of
the
*NL*
prison-door
,
she
repelled
him
,
by
an
action
marked
with
natural
*NL*
dignity
and
force
of
character
,
and
stepped
into
the
open
air
as
*NL*
if
by
her
own
free
will
.
She
bore
in
her
arms
a
child
,
a
baby
of
*NL*
some
three
months
old
,
who
winked
and
turned
aside
its
little
*NL*
face
from
the
too
vivid
light
of
day
;
because
its
existence
,
*NL*
heretofore
,
had
brought
it
acquaintance
only
with
the
grey
*NL*
twilight
of
a
dungeon
,
or
other
darksome
apartment
of
the
*NL*
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
young
woman
--
the
mother
of
this
child
--
stood
fully
*NL*
revealed
before
the
crowd
,
it
seemed
to
be
her
first
impulse
to
*NL*
clasp
the
infant
closely
to
her
bosom
;
not
so
much
by
an
impulse
*NL*
of
motherly
affection
,
as
that
she
might
thereby
conceal
a
*NL*
certain
token
,
which
was
wrought
or
fastened
into
her
dress
.
In
*NL*
a
moment
,
however
,
wisely
judging
that
one
token
of
her
shame
*NL*
would
but
poorly
serve
to
hide
another
,
she
took
the
baby
on
her
*NL*
arm
,
and
with
a
burning
blush
,
and
yet
a
haughty
smile
,
and
a
*NL*
glance
that
would
not
be
abashed
,
looked
around
at
her
*NL*
townspeople
and
neighbours
.
On
the
breast
of
her
gown
,
in
fine
*NL*
red
cloth
,
surrounded
with
an
elaborate
embroidery
and
fantastic
*NL*
flourishes
of
gold
thread
,
appeared
the
letter
A
.
It
was
so
*NL*
artistically
done
,
and
with
so
much
fertility
and
gorgeous
*NL*
luxuriance
of
fancy
,
that
it
had
all
the
effect
of
a
last
and
*NL*
fitting
decoration
to
the
apparel
which
she
wore
,
and
which
was
*NL*
of
a
splendour
in
accordance
with
the
taste
of
the
age
,
but
*NL*
greatly
beyond
what
was
allowed
by
the
sumptuary
regulations
of
*NL*
the
colony
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
woman
was
tall
,
with
a
figure
of
perfect
elegance
on
a
*NL*
large
scale
.
She
had
dark
and
abundant
hair
,
so
glossy
that
it
*NL*
threw
off
the
sunshine
with
a
gleam
;
and
a
face
which
,
besides
*NL*
being
beautiful
from
regularity
of
feature
and
richness
of
*NL*
complexion
,
had
the
impressiveness
belonging
to
a
marked
brow
*NL*
and
deep
black
eyes
.
She
was
ladylike
,
too
,
after
the
manner
of
*NL*
the
feminine
gentility
of
those
days
;
characterised
by
a
certain
*NL*
state
and
dignity
,
rather
than
by
the
delicate
,
evanescent
,
and
*NL*
indescribable
grace
which
is
now
recognised
as
its
indication
.
*NL*
And
never
had
Hester
Prynne
appeared
more
ladylike
,
in
the
*NL*
antique
interpretation
of
the
term
,
than
as
she
issued
from
the
*NL*
prison
.
Those
who
had
before
known
her
,
and
had
expected
to
*NL*
behold
her
dimmed
and
obscured
by
a
disastrous
cloud
,
were
*NL*
astonished
,
and
even
startled
,
to
perceive
how
her
beauty
shone
*NL*
out
,
and
made
a
halo
of
the
misfortune
and
ignominy
in
which
she
*NL*
was
enveloped
.
It
may
be
true
that
,
to
a
sensitive
observer
,
*NL*
there
was
some
thing
exquisitely
painful
in
it
.
Her
attire
,
*NL*
which
indeed
,
she
had
wrought
for
the
occasion
in
prison
,
and
*NL*
had
modelled
much
after
her
own
fancy
,
seemed
to
express
the
*NL*
attitude
of
her
spirit
,
the
desperate
recklessness
of
her
mood
,
*NL*
by
its
wild
and
picturesque
peculiarity
.
But
the
point
which
*NL*
drew
all
eyes
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
transfigured
the
wearer
--
so
that
*NL*
both
men
and
women
who
had
been
familiarly
acquainted
with
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
were
now
impressed
as
if
they
beheld
her
for
the
*NL*
first
time
--
was
that
SCARLET
LETTER
,
so
fantastically
*NL*
embroidered
and
illuminated
upon
her
bosom
.
It
had
the
effect
of
*NL*
a
spell
,
taking
her
out
of
the
ordinary
relations
with
humanity
,
*NL*
and
enclosing
her
in
a
sphere
by
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
hath
good
skill
at
her
needle
,
that
's
certain
,
''
remarked
*NL*
one
of
her
female
spectators
;
``
but
did
ever
a
woman
,
before
this
*NL*
brazen
hussy
,
contrive
such
a
way
of
showing
it
?
Why
,
gossips
,
*NL*
what
is
it
but
to
laugh
in
the
faces
of
our
godly
magistrates
,
*NL*
and
make
a
pride
out
of
what
they
,
worthy
gentlemen
,
meant
for
a
*NL*
punishment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
were
well
,
''
muttered
the
most
iron-visaged
of
the
old
dames
,
*NL*
``
if
we
stripped
Madame
Hester
's
rich
gown
off
her
dainty
*NL*
shoulders
;
and
as
for
the
red
letter
which
she
hath
stitched
so
*NL*
curiously
,
I
'll
bestow
a
rag
of
mine
own
rheumatic
flannel
to
*NL*
make
a
fitter
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
peace
,
neighbours
--
peace
!
''
whispered
their
youngest
*NL*
companion
;
``
do
not
let
her
hear
you
!
Not
a
stitch
in
that
*NL*
embroidered
letter
but
she
has
felt
it
in
her
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grim
beadle
now
made
a
gesture
with
his
staff
.
``
Make
way
,
*NL*
good
people
--
make
way
,
in
the
King
's
name
!
''
cried
he
.
``
Open
a
*NL*
passage
;
and
I
promise
ye
,
Mistress
Prynne
shall
be
set
where
*NL*
man
,
woman
,
and
child
may
have
a
fair
sight
of
her
brave
apparel
*NL*
from
this
time
till
an
hour
past
meridian
.
A
blessing
on
the
*NL*
righteous
colony
of
the
Massachusetts
,
where
iniquity
is
dragged
*NL*
out
into
the
sunshine
!
Come
along
,
Madame
Hester
,
and
show
your
*NL*
scarlet
letter
in
the
market-place
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
lane
was
forthwith
opened
through
the
crowd
of
spectators
.
*NL*
Preceded
by
the
beadle
,
and
attended
by
an
irregular
procession
*NL*
of
stern-browed
men
and
unkindly
visaged
women
,
Hester
Prynne
*NL*
set
forth
towards
the
place
appointed
for
her
punishment
.
A
*NL*
crowd
of
eager
and
curious
schoolboys
,
understanding
little
of
*NL*
the
matter
in
hand
,
except
that
it
gave
them
a
half-holiday
,
ran
*NL*
before
her
progress
,
turning
their
heads
continually
to
stare
*NL*
into
her
face
and
at
the
winking
baby
in
her
arms
,
and
at
the
*NL*
ignominious
letter
on
her
breast
.
It
was
no
great
distance
,
in
*NL*
those
days
,
from
the
prison
door
to
the
market-place
.
Measured
*NL*
by
the
prisoner
's
experience
,
however
,
it
might
be
reckoned
a
*NL*
journey
of
some
length
;
for
haughty
as
her
demeanour
was
,
she
*NL*
perchance
underwent
an
agony
from
every
footstep
of
those
that
*NL*
thronged
to
see
her
,
as
if
her
heart
had
been
flung
into
the
*NL*
street
for
them
all
to
spurn
and
trample
upon
.
In
our
nature
,
*NL*
however
,
there
is
a
provision
,
alike
marvellous
and
merciful
,
*NL*
that
the
sufferer
should
never
know
the
intensity
of
what
he
*NL*
endures
by
its
present
torture
,
but
chiefly
by
the
pang
that
*NL*
rankles
after
it
.
With
almost
a
serene
deportment
,
therefore
,
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
passed
through
this
portion
of
her
ordeal
,
and
*NL*
came
to
a
sort
of
scaffold
,
at
the
western
extremity
of
the
*NL*
market-place
.
It
stood
nearly
beneath
the
eaves
of
Boston
's
*NL*
earliest
church
,
and
appeared
to
be
a
fixture
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
this
scaffold
constituted
a
portion
of
a
penal
machine
,
*NL*
which
now
,
for
two
or
three
generations
past
,
has
been
merely
*NL*
historical
and
traditionary
among
us
,
but
was
held
,
in
the
old
*NL*
time
,
to
be
as
effectual
an
agent
,
in
the
promotion
of
good
*NL*
citizenship
,
as
ever
was
the
guillotine
among
the
terrorists
of
*NL*
France
.
It
was
,
in
short
,
the
platform
of
the
pillory
;
and
above
*NL*
it
rose
the
framework
of
that
instrument
of
discipline
,
so
*NL*
fashioned
as
to
confine
the
human
head
in
its
tight
grasp
,
and
*NL*
thus
hold
it
up
to
the
public
gaze
.
The
very
ideal
of
ignominy
*NL*
was
embodied
and
made
manifest
in
this
contrivance
of
wood
and
*NL*
iron
.
There
can
be
no
outrage
,
methinks
,
against
our
common
*NL*
nature
--
whatever
be
the
delinquencies
of
the
individual
--
no
*NL*
outrage
more
flagrant
than
to
forbid
the
culprit
to
hide
his
*NL*
face
for
shame
;
as
it
was
the
essence
of
this
punishment
to
do
.
*NL*
In
Hester
Prynne
's
instance
,
however
,
as
not
unfrequently
in
*NL*
other
cases
,
her
sentence
bore
that
she
should
stand
a
certain
*NL*
time
upon
the
platform
,
but
without
undergoing
that
gripe
about
*NL*
the
neck
and
confinement
of
the
head
,
the
proneness
to
which
was
*NL*
the
most
devilish
characteristic
of
this
ugly
engine
.
Knowing
*NL*
well
her
part
,
she
ascended
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
,
and
was
*NL*
thus
displayed
to
the
surrounding
multitude
,
at
about
the
height
*NL*
of
a
man
's
shoulders
above
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
there
been
a
Papist
among
the
crowd
of
Puritans
,
he
might
*NL*
have
seen
in
this
beautiful
woman
,
so
picturesque
in
her
attire
*NL*
and
mien
,
and
with
the
infant
at
her
bosom
,
an
object
to
remind
*NL*
him
of
the
image
of
Divine
Maternity
,
which
so
many
illustrious
*NL*
painters
have
vied
with
one
another
to
represent
;
something
*NL*
which
should
remind
him
,
indeed
,
but
only
by
contrast
,
of
that
*NL*
sacred
image
of
sinless
motherhood
,
whose
infant
was
to
redeem
*NL*
the
world
.
Here
,
there
was
the
taint
of
deepest
sin
in
the
most
*NL*
sacred
quality
of
human
life
,
working
such
effect
,
that
the
*NL*
world
was
only
the
darker
for
this
woman
's
beauty
,
and
the
more
*NL*
lost
for
the
infant
that
she
had
borne
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
was
not
without
a
mixture
of
awe
,
such
as
must
always
*NL*
invest
the
spectacle
of
guilt
and
shame
in
a
fellow-creature
,
*NL*
before
society
shall
have
grown
corrupt
enough
to
smile
,
instead
*NL*
of
shuddering
at
it
.
The
witnesses
of
Hester
Prynne
's
disgrace
*NL*
had
not
yet
passed
beyond
their
simplicity
.
They
were
stern
*NL*
enough
to
look
upon
her
death
,
had
that
been
the
sentence
,
*NL*
without
a
murmur
at
its
severity
,
but
had
none
of
the
*NL*
heartlessness
of
another
social
state
,
which
would
find
only
a
*NL*
theme
for
jest
in
an
exhibition
like
the
present
.
Even
had
there
*NL*
been
a
disposition
to
turn
the
matter
into
ridicule
,
it
must
*NL*
have
been
repressed
and
overpowered
by
the
solemn
presence
of
*NL*
men
no
less
dignified
than
the
governor
,
and
several
of
his
*NL*
counsellors
,
a
judge
,
a
general
,
and
the
ministers
of
the
town
,
*NL*
all
of
whom
sat
or
stood
in
a
balcony
of
the
meeting-house
,
*NL*
looking
down
upon
the
platform
.
When
such
personages
could
*NL*
constitute
a
part
of
the
spectacle
,
without
risking
the
majesty
,
*NL*
or
reverence
of
rank
and
office
,
it
was
safely
to
be
inferred
*NL*
that
the
infliction
of
a
legal
sentence
would
have
an
earnest
*NL*
and
effectual
meaning
.
Accordingly
,
the
crowd
was
sombre
and
*NL*
grave
.
The
unhappy
culprit
sustained
herself
as
best
a
woman
*NL*
might
,
under
the
heavy
weight
of
a
thousand
unrelenting
eyes
,
*NL*
all
fastened
upon
her
,
and
concentrated
at
her
bosom
.
It
was
*NL*
almost
intolerable
to
be
borne
.
Of
an
impulsive
and
passionate
*NL*
nature
,
she
had
fortified
herself
to
encounter
the
stings
and
*NL*
venomous
stabs
of
public
contumely
,
wreaking
itself
in
every
*NL*
variety
of
insult
;
but
there
was
a
quality
so
much
more
terrible
*NL*
in
the
solemn
mood
of
the
popular
mind
,
that
she
longed
rather
*NL*
to
behold
all
those
rigid
countenances
contorted
with
scornful
*NL*
merriment
,
and
herself
the
object
.
Had
a
roar
of
laughter
burst
*NL*
from
the
multitude
--
each
man
,
each
woman
,
each
little
*NL*
shrill-voiced
child
,
contributing
their
individual
parts
--
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
might
have
repaid
them
all
with
a
bitter
and
disdainful
*NL*
smile
.
But
,
under
the
leaden
infliction
which
it
was
her
doom
to
*NL*
endure
,
she
felt
,
at
moments
,
as
if
she
must
needs
shriek
out
*NL*
with
the
full
power
of
her
lungs
,
and
cast
herself
from
the
*NL*
scaffold
down
upon
the
ground
,
or
else
go
mad
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
there
were
intervals
when
the
whole
scene
,
in
which
she
was
*NL*
the
most
conspicuous
object
,
seemed
to
vanish
from
her
eyes
,
or
,
*NL*
at
least
,
glimmered
indistinctly
before
them
,
like
a
mass
of
*NL*
imperfectly
shaped
and
spectral
images
.
Her
mind
,
and
especially
*NL*
her
memory
,
was
preternaturally
active
,
and
kept
bringing
up
*NL*
other
scenes
than
this
roughly
hewn
street
of
a
little
town
,
on
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
western
wilderness
:
other
faces
than
were
*NL*
lowering
upon
her
from
beneath
the
brims
of
those
*NL*
steeple-crowned
hats
.
Reminiscences
,
the
most
trifling
and
*NL*
immaterial
,
passages
of
infancy
and
school-days
,
sports
,
*NL*
childish
quarrels
,
and
the
little
domestic
traits
of
her
maiden
*NL*
years
,
came
swarming
back
upon
her
,
intermingled
with
*NL*
recollections
of
whatever
was
gravest
in
her
subsequent
life
;
*NL*
one
picture
precisely
as
vivid
as
another
;
as
if
all
were
of
*NL*
similar
importance
,
or
all
alike
a
play
.
Possibly
,
it
was
an
*NL*
instinctive
device
of
her
spirit
to
relieve
itself
by
the
*NL*
exhibition
of
these
phantasmagoric
forms
,
from
the
cruel
weight
*NL*
and
hardness
of
the
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Be
that
as
it
might
,
the
scaffold
of
the
pillory
was
a
point
of
*NL*
view
that
revealed
to
Hester
Prynne
the
entire
track
along
which
*NL*
she
had
been
treading
,
since
her
happy
infancy
.
Standing
on
that
*NL*
miserable
eminence
,
she
saw
again
her
native
village
,
in
Old
*NL*
England
,
and
her
paternal
home
:
a
decayed
house
of
grey
stone
,
*NL*
with
a
poverty-stricken
aspect
,
but
retaining
a
half
obliterated
*NL*
shield
of
arms
over
the
portal
,
in
token
of
antique
gentility
.
*NL*
She
saw
her
father
's
face
,
with
its
bold
brow
,
and
reverend
*NL*
white
beard
that
flowed
over
the
old-fashioned
Elizabethan
ruff
;
*NL*
her
mother
's
,
too
,
with
the
look
of
heedful
and
anxious
love
*NL*
which
it
always
wore
in
her
remembrance
,
and
which
,
even
since
*NL*
her
death
,
had
so
often
laid
the
impediment
of
a
gentle
*NL*
remonstrance
in
her
daughter
's
pathway
.
She
saw
her
own
face
,
*NL*
glowing
with
girlish
beauty
,
and
illuminating
all
the
interior
*NL*
of
the
dusky
mirror
in
which
she
had
been
wont
to
gaze
at
it
.
*NL*
There
she
beheld
another
countenance
,
of
a
man
well
stricken
in
*NL*
years
,
a
pale
,
thin
,
scholar-like
visage
,
with
eyes
dim
and
*NL*
bleared
by
the
lamp-light
that
had
served
them
to
pore
over
many
*NL*
ponderous
books
.
Yet
those
same
bleared
optics
had
a
strange
,
*NL*
penetrating
power
,
when
it
was
their
owner
's
purpose
to
read
the
*NL*
human
soul
.
This
figure
of
the
study
and
the
cloister
,
as
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
's
womanly
fancy
failed
not
to
recall
,
was
slightly
*NL*
deformed
,
with
the
left
shoulder
a
trifle
higher
than
the
right
.
*NL*
Next
rose
before
her
in
memory
's
picture-gallery
,
the
intricate
*NL*
and
narrow
thoroughfares
,
the
tall
,
grey
houses
,
the
huge
*NL*
cathedrals
,
and
the
public
edifices
,
ancient
in
date
and
quaint
*NL*
in
architecture
,
of
a
continental
city
;
where
new
life
had
*NL*
awaited
her
,
still
in
connexion
with
the
misshapen
scholar
:
a
*NL*
new
life
,
but
feeding
itself
on
time-worn
materials
,
like
a
tuft
*NL*
of
green
moss
on
a
crumbling
wall
.
Lastly
,
in
lieu
of
these
*NL*
shifting
scenes
,
came
back
the
rude
market-place
of
the
Puritan
,
*NL*
settlement
,
with
all
the
townspeople
assembled
,
and
levelling
*NL*
their
stern
regards
at
Hester
Prynne
--
yes
,
at
herself
--
who
stood
*NL*
on
the
scaffold
of
the
pillory
,
an
infant
on
her
arm
,
and
the
*NL*
letter
A
,
in
scarlet
,
fantastically
embroidered
with
gold
*NL*
thread
,
upon
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Could
it
be
true
?
She
clutched
the
child
so
fiercely
to
her
*NL*
breast
that
it
sent
forth
a
cry
;
she
turned
her
eyes
downward
at
*NL*
the
scarlet
letter
,
and
even
touched
it
with
her
finger
,
to
*NL*
assure
herself
that
the
infant
and
the
shame
were
real
.
Yes
*NL*
these
were
her
realities
--
all
else
had
vanished
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
.
THE
RECOGNITION
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
intense
consciousness
of
being
the
object
of
severe
*NL*
and
universal
observation
,
the
wearer
of
the
scarlet
letter
was
*NL*
at
length
relieved
,
by
discerning
,
on
the
outskirts
of
the
*NL*
crowd
,
a
figure
which
irresistibly
took
possession
of
her
*NL*
thoughts
.
An
Indian
in
his
native
garb
was
standing
there
;
but
*NL*
the
red
men
were
not
so
infrequent
visitors
of
the
English
*NL*
settlements
that
one
of
them
would
have
attracted
any
notice
*NL*
from
Hester
Prynne
at
such
a
time
;
much
less
would
he
have
*NL*
excluded
all
other
objects
and
ideas
from
her
mind
.
By
the
*NL*
Indian
's
side
,
and
evidently
sustaining
a
companionship
with
*NL*
him
,
stood
a
white
man
,
clad
in
a
strange
disarray
of
civilized
*NL*
and
savage
costume
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
small
in
stature
,
with
a
furrowed
visage
,
which
as
yet
*NL*
could
hardly
be
termed
aged
.
There
was
a
remarkable
intelligence
*NL*
in
his
features
,
as
of
a
person
who
had
so
cultivated
his
mental
*NL*
part
that
it
could
not
fail
to
mould
the
physical
to
itself
and
*NL*
become
manifest
by
unmistakable
tokens
.
Although
,
by
a
seemingly
*NL*
careless
arrangement
of
his
heterogeneous
garb
,
he
had
*NL*
endeavoured
to
conceal
or
abate
the
peculiarity
,
it
was
*NL*
sufficiently
evident
to
Hester
Prynne
that
one
of
this
man
's
*NL*
shoulders
rose
higher
than
the
other
.
Again
,
at
the
first
*NL*
instant
of
perceiving
that
thin
visage
,
and
the
slight
deformity
*NL*
of
the
figure
,
she
pressed
her
infant
to
her
bosom
with
so
*NL*
convulsive
a
force
that
the
poor
babe
uttered
another
cry
of
*NL*
pain
.
But
the
mother
did
not
seem
to
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
arrival
in
the
market-place
,
and
some
time
before
she
saw
*NL*
him
,
the
stranger
had
bent
his
eyes
on
Hester
Prynne
.
It
was
*NL*
carelessly
at
first
,
like
a
man
chiefly
accustomed
to
look
*NL*
inward
,
and
to
whom
external
matters
are
of
little
value
and
*NL*
import
,
unless
they
bear
relation
to
something
within
his
mind
.
*NL*
Very
soon
,
however
,
his
look
became
keen
and
penetrative
.
A
*NL*
writhing
horror
twisted
itself
across
his
features
,
like
a
snake
*NL*
gliding
swiftly
over
them
,
and
making
one
little
pause
,
with
all
*NL*
its
wreathed
intervolutions
in
open
sight
.
His
face
darkened
*NL*
with
some
powerful
emotion
,
which
,
nevertheless
,
he
so
*NL*
instantaneously
controlled
by
an
effort
of
his
will
,
that
,
save
*NL*
at
a
single
moment
,
its
expression
might
have
passed
for
*NL*
calmness
.
After
a
brief
space
,
the
convulsion
grew
almost
*NL*
imperceptible
,
and
finally
subsided
into
the
depths
of
his
*NL*
nature
.
When
he
found
the
eyes
of
Hester
Prynne
fastened
on
his
*NL*
own
,
and
saw
that
she
appeared
to
recognize
him
,
he
slowly
and
*NL*
calmly
raised
his
finger
,
made
a
gesture
with
it
in
the
air
,
and
*NL*
laid
it
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
touching
the
shoulder
of
a
townsman
who
stood
near
to
him
,
*NL*
he
addressed
him
in
a
formal
and
courteous
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pray
you
,
good
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
who
is
this
woman
?
--
and
*NL*
wherefore
is
she
here
set
up
to
public
shame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
needs
be
a
stranger
in
this
region
,
friend
,
''
answered
*NL*
the
townsman
,
looking
curiously
at
the
questioner
and
his
savage
*NL*
companion
,
``
else
you
would
surely
have
heard
of
Mistress
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
and
her
evil
doings
.
She
hath
raised
a
great
scandal
,
I
*NL*
promise
you
,
in
godly
Master
Dimmesdale
's
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
truly
,
''
replied
the
other
;
``
I
am
a
stranger
,
and
have
*NL*
been
a
wanderer
,
sorely
against
my
will
.
I
have
met
with
*NL*
grievous
mishaps
by
sea
and
land
,
and
have
been
long
held
in
*NL*
bonds
among
the
heathen-folk
to
the
southward
;
and
am
now
*NL*
brought
hither
by
this
Indian
to
be
redeemed
out
of
my
*NL*
captivity
.
Will
it
please
you
,
therefore
,
to
tell
me
of
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
's
--
have
I
her
name
rightly
?
--
of
this
woman
's
offences
,
*NL*
and
what
has
brought
her
to
yonder
scaffold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
friend
;
and
methinks
it
must
gladden
your
heart
,
after
*NL*
your
troubles
and
sojourn
in
the
wilderness
,
''
said
the
townsman
,
*NL*
``
to
find
yourself
at
length
in
a
land
where
iniquity
is
searched
*NL*
out
and
punished
in
the
sight
of
rulers
and
people
,
as
here
in
*NL*
our
godly
New
England
.
Yonder
woman
,
Sir
,
you
must
know
,
was
the
*NL*
wife
of
a
certain
learned
man
,
English
by
birth
,
but
who
had
*NL*
long
ago
dwelt
in
Amsterdam
,
whence
some
good
time
agone
he
was
*NL*
minded
to
cross
over
and
cast
in
his
lot
with
us
of
the
*NL*
Massachusetts
.
To
this
purpose
he
sent
his
wife
before
him
,
*NL*
remaining
himself
to
look
after
some
necessary
affairs
.
Marry
,
*NL*
good
Sir
,
in
some
two
years
,
or
less
,
that
the
woman
has
been
a
*NL*
dweller
here
in
Boston

come

this
learned

Master
Prynne

his
young
wife
,
look
you

being
*NL*
left
to
her
own
misguidance
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
--
aha
!
--
I
conceive
you
,
''
said
the
stranger
with
a
bitter
*NL*
smile
.
``
So
learned
a
man
as
you
speak
of
should
have
learned
*NL*
this

in
his
books

And
who

by
your
favour
,
Sir
,
may
be
the
*NL*
father
of
yonder
babe
--
it
is
some
three
or
four
months
old
,
I
*NL*
should
judge

which
Mistress
Prynne
is
holding
in
her
arms
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
a
truth
,
friend
,
that
matter
remaineth
a
riddle
;
and
the
*NL*
Daniel
who
shall
expound
it
is
yet
a-wanting
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
townsman
.
``
Madame
Hester
absolutely
refuseth
to
speak
,
and
the
*NL*
magistrates
have
laid
their
heads
together
in
vain
.
Peradventure
*NL*
the
guilty
one
stands
looking
on
at
this
sad
spectacle
,
unknown
*NL*
of
man
,
and
forgetting
that
God
sees
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
learned
man
,
''
observed
the
stranger
with
another
smile
,
*NL*
``
should
come
himself
to
look
into
the
mystery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
behoves
him
well
if
he
be
still
in
life
,
''
responded
the
*NL*
townsman
.
``
Now
,
good
Sir
,
our
Massachusetts
magistracy
,
*NL*
bethinking
themselves
that
this
woman
is
youthful
and
fair
,
and
*NL*
doubtless
was
strongly
tempted
to
her
fall
,
and
that
,
moreover
,
*NL*
as
is
most
likely
,
her
husband
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
*NL*
they
have
not
been
bold
to
put
in
force
the
extremity
of
our
*NL*
righteous
law
against
her
.
The
penalty
thereof
is
death
.
But
in
*NL*
their
great
mercy
and
tenderness
of
heart
they
have
doomed
*NL*
Mistress
Prynne
to
stand
only
a
space
of
three
hours
on
the
*NL*
platform
of
the
pillory
,
and
then
and
thereafter
,
for
the
*NL*
remainder
of
her
natural
life
to
wear
a
mark
of
shame
upon
her
*NL*
bosom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
wise
sentence
,
''
remarked
the
stranger
,
gravely
,
bowing
his
*NL*
head
.
``
Thus
she
will
be
a
living
sermon
against
sin
,
until
the
*NL*
ignominious
letter
be
engraved
upon
her
tombstone
.
It
irks
me
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
that
the
partner
of
her
iniquity
should
not
at
*NL*
least
,
stand
on
the
scaffold
by
her
side
.
But
he
will
be
*NL*
known
--
he
will
be
known
!
--
he
will
be
known
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
courteously
to
the
communicative
townsman
,
and
*NL*
whispering
a
few
words
to
his
Indian
attendant
,
they
both
made
*NL*
their
way
through
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
passed
,
Hester
Prynne
had
been
standing
on
her
*NL*
pedestal
,
still
with
a
fixed
gaze
towards
the
stranger
--
so
fixed
*NL*
a
gaze
that
,
at
moments
of
intense
absorption
,
all
other
objects
*NL*
in
the
visible
world
seemed
to
vanish
,
leaving
only
him
and
her
.
*NL*
Such
an
interview
,
perhaps
,
would
have
been
more
terrible
than
*NL*
even
to
meet
him
as
she
now
did
,
with
the
hot
mid-day
sun
*NL*
burning
down
upon
her
face
,
and
lighting
up
its
shame
;
with
the
*NL*
scarlet
token
of
infamy
on
her
breast
;
with
the
sin-born
infant
*NL*
in
her
arms
;
with
a
whole
people
,
drawn
forth
as
to
a
festival
,
*NL*
staring
at
the
features
that
should
have
been
seen
only
in
the
*NL*
quiet
gleam
of
the
fireside
,
in
the
happy
shadow
of
a
home
,
or
*NL*
beneath
a
matronly
veil
at
church
.
Dreadful
as
it
was
,
she
was
*NL*
conscious
of
a
shelter
in
the
presence
of
these
thousand
*NL*
witnesses
.
It
was
better
to
stand
thus
,
with
so
many
betwixt
him
*NL*
and
her
,
than
to
greet
him
face
to
face
--
they
two
alone
.
She
*NL*
fled
for
refuge
,
as
it
were
,
to
the
public
exposure
,
and
dreaded
*NL*
the
moment
when
its
protection
should
be
withdrawn
from
her
.
*NL*
Involved
in
these
thoughts
,
she
scarcely
heard
a
voice
behind
*NL*
her
until
it
had
repeated
her
name
more
than
once
,
in
a
loud
and
*NL*
solemn
tone
,
audible
to
the
whole
multitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hearken
unto
me
,
Hester
Prynne
!
''
said
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
already
been
noticed
that
directly
over
the
platform
on
*NL*
which
Hester
Prynne
stood
was
a
kind
of
balcony
,
or
open
*NL*
gallery
,
appended
to
the
meeting-house
.
It
was
the
place
whence
*NL*
proclamations
were
wont
to
be
made
,
amidst
an
assemblage
of
the
*NL*
magistracy
,
with
all
the
ceremonial
that
attended
such
public
*NL*
observances
in
those
days
.
Here
,
to
witness
the
scene
which
we
*NL*
are
describing
,
sat
Governor
Bellingham
himself
with
four
*NL*
sergeants
about
his
chair
,
bearing
halberds
,
as
a
guard
of
*NL*
honour
.
He
wore
a
dark
feather
in
his
hat
,
a
border
of
*NL*
embroidery
on
his
cloak
,
and
a
black
velvet
tunic
beneath
--
a
*NL*
gentleman
advanced
in
years
,
with
a
hard
experience
written
in
*NL*
his
wrinkles
.
He
was
not
ill-fitted
to
be
the
head
and
*NL*
representative
of
a
community
which
owed
its
origin
and
*NL*
progress
,
and
its
present
state
of
development
,
not
to
the
*NL*
impulses
of
youth
,
but
to
the
stern
and
tempered
energies
of
*NL*
manhood
and
the
sombre
sagacity
of
age
;
accomplishing
so
much
,
*NL*
precisely
because
it
imagined
and
hoped
so
little
.
The
other
*NL*
eminent
characters
by
whom
the
chief
ruler
was
surrounded
were
*NL*
distinguished
by
a
dignity
of
mien
,
belonging
to
a
period
when
*NL*
the
forms
of
authority
were
felt
to
possess
the
sacredness
of
*NL*
Divine
institutions
.
They
were
,
doubtless
,
good
men
,
just
and
*NL*
sage
.
But
,
out
of
the
whole
human
family
,
it
would
not
have
been
*NL*
easy
to
select
the
same
number
of
wise
and
virtuous
persons
,
who
*NL*
should
be
less
capable
of
sitting
in
judgment
on
an
erring
*NL*
woman
's
heart
,
and
disentangling
its
mesh
of
good
and
evil
,
than
*NL*
the
sages
of
rigid
aspect
towards
whom
Hester
Prynne
now
turned
*NL*
her
face
.
She
seemed
conscious
,
indeed
,
that
whatever
sympathy
*NL*
she
might
expect
lay
in
the
larger
and
warmer
heart
of
the
*NL*
multitude
;
for
,
as
she
lifted
her
eyes
towards
the
balcony
,
the
*NL*
unhappy
woman
grew
pale
,
and
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
which
had
called
her
attention
was
that
of
the
*NL*
reverend
and
famous
John
Wilson
,
the
eldest
clergyman
of
Boston
,
*NL*
a
great
scholar
,
like
most
of
his
contemporaries
in
the
*NL*
profession
,
and
withal
a
man
of
kind
and
genial
spirit
.
This
*NL*
last
attribute
,
however
,
had
been
less
carefully
developed
than
*NL*
his
intellectual
gifts
,
and
was
,
in
truth
,
rather
a
matter
of
*NL*
shame
than
self-congratulation
with
him
.
There
he
stood
,
with
a
*NL*
border
of
grizzled
locks
beneath
his
skull-cap
,
while
his
grey
*NL*
eyes
,
accustomed
to
the
shaded
light
of
his
study
,
were
winking
,
*NL*
like
those
of
Hester
's
infant
,
in
the
unadulterated
sunshine
.
He
*NL*
looked
like
the
darkly
engraved
portraits
which
we
see
prefixed
*NL*
to
old
volumes
of
sermons
,
and
had
no
more
right
than
one
of
*NL*
those
portraits
would
have
to
step
forth
,
as
he
now
did
,
and
*NL*
meddle
with
a
question
of
human
guilt
,
passion
,
and
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hester
Prynne
,
''
said
the
clergyman
,
``
I
have
striven
with
my
*NL*
young
brother
here
,
under
whose
preaching
of
the
Word
you
have
*NL*
been
privileged
to
sit
''
--
here
Mr.
Wilson
laid
his
hand
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
of
a
pale
young
man
beside
him
--
``
I
have
sought
,
I
say
,
*NL*
to
persuade
this
godly
youth
,
that
he
should
deal
with
you
,
here
*NL*
in
the
face
of
Heaven
,
and
before
these
wise
and
upright
rulers
,
*NL*
and
in
hearing
of
all
the
people
,
as
touching
the
vileness
and
*NL*
blackness
of
your
sin
.
Knowing
your
natural
temper
better
than
*NL*
I
,
he
could
the
better
judge
what
arguments
to
use
,
whether
of
*NL*
tenderness
or
terror
,
such
as
might
prevail
over
your
hardness
*NL*
and
obstinacy
,
insomuch
that
you
should
no
longer
hide
the
name
*NL*
of
him
who
tempted
you
to
this
grievous
fall
.
But
he
opposes
to
*NL*
me
--
with
a
young
man
's
over-softness
,
albeit
wise
beyond
his
*NL*
years
--
that
it
were
wronging
the
very
nature
of
woman
to
force
*NL*
her
to
lay
open
her
heart
's
secrets
in
such
broad
daylight
,
and
*NL*
in
presence
of
so
great
a
multitude
.
Truly
,
as
I
sought
to
*NL*
convince
him
,
the
shame
lay
in
the
commission
of
the
sin
,
and
*NL*
not
in
the
showing
of
it
forth
.
What
say
you
to
it
,
once
again
,
*NL*
brother
Dimmesdale
?
Must
it
be
thou
,
or
I
,
that
shall
deal
with
*NL*
this
poor
sinner
's
soul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
murmur
among
the
dignified
and
reverend
occupants
of
*NL*
the
balcony
;
and
Governor
Bellingham
gave
expression
to
its
*NL*
purport
,
speaking
in
an
authoritative
voice
,
although
tempered
*NL*
with
respect
towards
the
youthful
clergyman
whom
he
addressed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Master
Dimmesdale
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
responsibility
of
this
*NL*
woman
's
soul
lies
greatly
with
you
.
It
behoves
you
;
therefore
,
*NL*
to
exhort
her
to
repentance
and
to
confession
,
as
a
proof
and
*NL*
consequence
thereof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
directness
of
this
appeal
drew
the
eyes
of
the
whole
crowd
*NL*
upon
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
--
young
clergyman
,
who
had
come
*NL*
from
one
of
the
great
English
universities
,
bringing
all
the
*NL*
learning
of
the
age
into
our
wild
forest
land
.
His
eloquence
and
*NL*
religious
fervour
had
already
given
the
earnest
of
high
eminence
*NL*
in
his
profession
.
He
was
a
person
of
very
striking
aspect
,
with
*NL*
a
white
,
lofty
,
and
impending
brow
;
large
,
brown
,
melancholy
*NL*
eyes
,
and
a
mouth
which
,
unless
when
he
forcibly
compressed
it
,
*NL*
was
apt
to
be
tremulous
,
expressing
both
nervous
sensibility
and
*NL*
a
vast
power
of
self
restraint
.
Notwithstanding
his
high
native
*NL*
gifts
and
scholar-like
attainments
,
there
was
an
air
about
this
*NL*
young
minister
--
an
apprehensive
,
a
startled
,
a
half-frightened
*NL*
look
--
as
of
a
being
who
felt
himself
quite
astray
,
and
at
a
loss
*NL*
in
the
pathway
of
human
existence
,
and
could
only
be
at
ease
in
*NL*
some
seclusion
of
his
own
.
Therefore
,
so
far
as
his
duties
would
*NL*
permit
,
he
trod
in
the
shadowy
by-paths
,
and
thus
kept
himself
*NL*
simple
and
childlike
,
coming
forth
,
when
occasion
was
,
with
a
*NL*
freshness
,
and
fragrance
,
and
dewy
purity
of
thought
,
which
,
as
*NL*
many
people
said
,
affected
them
like
the
speech
of
an
angel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
young
man
whom
the
Reverend
Mr.
Wilson
and
the
*NL*
Governor
had
introduced
so
openly
to
the
public
notice
,
bidding
*NL*
him
speak
,
in
the
hearing
of
all
men
,
to
that
mystery
of
a
*NL*
woman
's
soul
,
so
sacred
even
in
its
pollution
.
The
trying
nature
*NL*
of
his
position
drove
the
blood
from
his
cheek
,
and
made
his
*NL*
lips
tremulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
to
the
woman
,
my
brother
,
''
said
Mr.
Wilson
.
``
It
is
of
*NL*
moment
to
her
soul
,
and
,
therefore
,
as
the
worshipful
Governor
*NL*
says
,
momentous
to
thine
own
,
in
whose
charge
hers
is
.
Exhort
*NL*
her
to
confess
the
truth
!
''

The
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
bent
his
head
,
in
silent
prayer
,
*NL*
as
it
seemed
,
and
then
came
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hester
Prynne
,
''
said
he
,
leaning
over
the
balcony
and
looking
*NL*
down
steadfastly
into
her
eyes
,
``
thou
hearest
what
this
good
man
*NL*
says
,
and
seest
the
accountability
under
which
I
labour
.
If
thou
*NL*
feelest
it
to
be
for
thy
soul
's
peace
,
and
that
thy
earthly
*NL*
punishment
will
thereby
be
made
more
effectual
to
salvation
,
I
*NL*
charge
thee
to
speak
out
the
name
of
thy
fellow-sinner
and
*NL*
fellow-sufferer
!
Be
not
silent
from
any
mistaken
pity
and
*NL*
tenderness
for
him
;
for
,
believe
me
,
Hester
,
though
he
were
to
*NL*
step
down
from
a
high
place
,
and
stand
there
beside
thee
,
on
thy
*NL*
pedestal
of
shame
,
yet
better
were
it
so
than
to
hide
a
guilty
*NL*
heart
through
life
.
What
can
thy
silence
do
for
him
,
except
it
*NL*
tempt
him
--
yea
,
compel
him
,
as
it
were
--
to
add
hypocrisy
to
sin
?
*NL*
Heaven
hath
granted
thee
an
open
ignominy
,
that
thereby
thou
*NL*
mayest
work
out
an
open
triumph
over
the
evil
within
thee
and
*NL*
the
sorrow
without
.
Take
heed
how
thou
deniest
to
him
--
who
,
*NL*
perchance
,
hath
not
the
courage
to
grasp
it
for
himself
--
the
*NL*
bitter
,
but
wholesome
,
cup
that
is
now
presented
to
thy
lips
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
pastor
's
voice
was
tremulously
sweet
,
rich
,
deep
,
and
*NL*
broken
.
The
feeling
that
it
so
evidently
manifested
,
rather
than
*NL*
the
direct
purport
of
the
words
,
caused
it
to
vibrate
within
all
*NL*
hearts
,
and
brought
the
listeners
into
one
accord
of
sympathy
.
*NL*
Even
the
poor
baby
at
Hester
's
bosom
was
affected
by
the
same
*NL*
influence
,
for
it
directed
its
hitherto
vacant
gaze
towards
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
,
and
held
up
its
little
arms
with
a
half-pleased
,
*NL*
half-plaintive
murmur
.
So
powerful
seemed
the
minister
's
appeal
*NL*
that
the
people
could
not
believe
but
that
Hester
Prynne
would
*NL*
speak
out
the
guilty
name
,
or
else
that
the
guilty
one
himself
*NL*
in
whatever
high
or
lowly
place
he
stood
,
would
be
drawn
forth
*NL*
by
an
inward
and
inevitable
necessity
,
and
compelled
to
ascend
*NL*
the
scaffold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woman
,
transgress
not
beyond
the
limits
of
Heaven
's
mercy
!
''
*NL*
cried
the
Reverend
Mr.
Wilson
,
more
harshly
than
before
.
``
That
*NL*
little
babe
hath
been
gifted
with
a
voice
,
to
second
and
confirm
*NL*
the
counsel
which
thou
hast
heard
.
Speak
out
the
name
!
That
,
and
*NL*
thy
repentance
,
may
avail
to
take
the
scarlet
letter
off
thy
*NL*
breast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
replied
Hester
Prynne
,
looking
,
not
at
Mr.
Wilson
,
but
*NL*
into
the
deep
and
troubled
eyes
of
the
younger
clergyman
.
``
It
is
*NL*
too
deeply
branded
.
Ye
can
not
take
it
off
.
And
would
that
I
*NL*
might
endure
his
agony
as
well
as
mine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
woman
!
''
said
another
voice
,
coldly
and
sternly
,
*NL*
proceeding
from
the
crowd
about
the
scaffold
,
``
Speak
;
and
give
*NL*
your
child
a
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
speak
!
''
answered
Hester
,
turning
pale
as
death
,
but
*NL*
responding
to
this
voice
,
which
she
too
surely
recognised
.
``
And
*NL*
my
child
must
seek
a
heavenly
father
;
she
shall
never
know
an
*NL*
earthly
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
not
speak
!
''
murmured
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
who
,
leaning
over
*NL*
the
balcony
,
with
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
had
awaited
the
*NL*
result
of
his
appeal
.
He
now
drew
back
with
a
long
respiration
.
*NL*
``
Wondrous
strength
and
generosity
of
a
woman
's
heart
!
She
will
*NL*
not
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Discerning
the
impracticable
state
of
the
poor
culprit
's
mind
,
*NL*
the
elder
clergyman
,
who
had
carefully
prepared
himself
for
the
*NL*
occasion
,
addressed
to
the
multitude
a
discourse
on
sin
,
in
all
*NL*
its
branches
,
but
with
continual
reference
to
the
ignominious
*NL*
letter
.
So
forcibly
did
he
dwell
upon
this
symbol
,
for
the
hour
*NL*
or
more
during
which
his
periods
were
rolling
over
the
people
's
*NL*
heads
,
that
it
assumed
new
terrors
in
their
imagination
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
derive
its
scarlet
hue
from
the
flames
of
the
infernal
*NL*
pit
.
Hester
Prynne
,
meanwhile
,
kept
her
place
upon
the
pedestal
*NL*
of
shame
,
with
glazed
eyes
,
and
an
air
of
weary
indifference
.
*NL*
She
had
borne
that
morning
all
that
nature
could
endure
;
and
as
*NL*
her
temperament
was
not
of
the
order
that
escapes
from
too
*NL*
intense
suffering
by
a
swoon
,
her
spirit
could
only
shelter
*NL*
itself
beneath
a
stony
crust
of
insensibility
,
while
the
*NL*
faculties
of
animal
life
remained
entire
.
In
this
state
,
the
*NL*
voice
of
the
preacher
thundered
remorselessly
,
but
unavailingly
,
*NL*
upon
her
ears
.
The
infant
,
during
the
latter
portion
of
her
*NL*
ordeal
,
pierced
the
air
with
its
wailings
and
screams
;
she
*NL*
strove
to
hush
it
mechanically
,
but
seemed
scarcely
to
*NL*
sympathise
with
its
trouble
.
With
the
same
hard
demeanour
,
she
*NL*
was
led
back
to
prison
,
and
vanished
from
the
public
gaze
within
*NL*
its
iron-clamped
portal
.
It
was
whispered
by
those
who
peered
*NL*
after
her
that
the
scarlet
letter
threw
a
lurid
gleam
along
the
*NL*
dark
passage-way
of
the
interior
.

THE
INTERVIEW
*NL*
*NL*
After
her
return
to
the
prison
,
Hester
Prynne
was
found
to
be
in
*NL*
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
,
that
demanded
constant
*NL*
watchfulness
,
lest
she
should
perpetrate
violence
on
herself
,
or
*NL*
do
some
half-frenzied
mischief
to
the
poor
babe
.
As
night
*NL*
approached
,
it
proving
impossible
to
quell
her
insubordination
*NL*
by
rebuke
or
threats
of
punishment
,
Master
Brackett
,
the
jailer
,
*NL*
thought
fit
to
introduce
a
physician
.
He
described
him
as
a
man
*NL*
of
skill
in
all
Christian
modes
of
physical
science
,
and
*NL*
likewise
familiar
with
whatever
the
savage
people
could
teach
in
*NL*
respect
to
medicinal
herbs
and
roots
that
grew
in
the
forest
.
To
*NL*
say
the
truth
,
there
was
much
need
of
professional
assistance
,
*NL*
not
merely
for
Hester
herself
,
but
still
more
urgently
for
the
*NL*
child
--
who
,
drawing
its
sustenance
from
the
maternal
bosom
,
*NL*
seemed
to
have
drank
in
with
it
all
the
turmoil
,
the
anguish
and
*NL*
despair
,
which
pervaded
the
mother
's
system
.
It
now
writhed
in
*NL*
convulsions
of
pain
,
and
was
a
forcible
type
,
in
its
little
*NL*
frame
,
of
the
moral
agony
which
Hester
Prynne
had
borne
*NL*
throughout
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Closely
following
the
jailer
into
the
dismal
apartment
,
appeared
*NL*
that
individual
,
of
singular
aspect
whose
presence
in
the
crowd
*NL*
had
been
of
such
deep
interest
to
the
wearer
of
the
scarlet
*NL*
letter
.
He
was
lodged
in
the
prison
,
not
as
suspected
of
any
*NL*
offence
,
but
as
the
most
convenient
and
suitable
mode
of
*NL*
disposing
of
him
,
until
the
magistrates
should
have
conferred
*NL*
with
the
Indian
sagamores
respecting
his
ransom
.
His
name
was
*NL*
announced
as
Roger
Chillingworth
.
The
jailer
,
after
ushering
him
*NL*
into
the
room
,
remained
a
moment
,
marvelling
at
the
comparative
*NL*
quiet
that
followed
his
entrance
;
for
Hester
Prynne
had
*NL*
immediately
become
as
still
as
death
,
although
the
child
*NL*
continued
to
moan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prithee
,
friend
,
leave
me
alone
with
my
patient
,
''
said
the
*NL*
practitioner
.
``
Trust
me
,
good
jailer
,
you
shall
briefly
have
*NL*
peace
in
your
house
;
and
,
I
promise
you
,
Mistress
Prynne
shall
*NL*
hereafter
be
more
amenable
to
just
authority
than
you
may
have
*NL*
found
her
heretofore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
if
your
worship
can
accomplish
that
,
''
answered
Master
*NL*
Brackett
,
``
I
shall
own
you
for
a
man
of
skill
,
indeed
!
Verily
,
*NL*
the
woman
hath
been
like
a
possessed
one
;
and
there
lacks
little
*NL*
that
I
should
take
in
hand
,
to
drive
Satan
out
of
her
with
*NL*
stripes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
had
entered
the
room
with
the
characteristic
*NL*
quietude
of
the
profession
to
which
he
announced
himself
as
*NL*
belonging
.
Nor
did
his
demeanour
change
when
the
withdrawal
of
*NL*
the
prison
keeper
left
him
face
to
face
with
the
woman
,
whose
*NL*
absorbed
notice
of
him
,
in
the
crowd
,
had
intimated
so
close
a
*NL*
relation
between
himself
and
her
.
His
first
care
was
given
to
*NL*
the
child
,
whose
cries
,
indeed
,
as
she
lay
writhing
on
the
*NL*
trundle-bed
,
made
it
of
peremptory
necessity
to
postpone
all
*NL*
other
business
to
the
task
of
soothing
her
.
He
examined
the
*NL*
infant
carefully
,
and
then
proceeded
to
unclasp
a
leathern
case
,
*NL*
which
he
took
from
beneath
his
dress
.
It
appeared
to
contain
*NL*
medical
preparations
,
one
of
which
he
mingled
with
a
cup
of
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
old
studies
in
alchemy
,
''
observed
he
,
``
and
my
sojourn
,
for
*NL*
above
a
year
past
,
among
a
people
well
versed
in
the
kindly
*NL*
properties
of
simples
,
have
made
a
better
physician
of
me
than
*NL*
many
that
claim
the
medical
degree
.
Here
,
woman
!
The
child
is
*NL*
yours
--
she
is
none
of
mine
--
neither
will
she
recognise
my
voice
*NL*
or
aspect
as
a
father
's
.
Administer
this
draught
,
therefore
,
*NL*
with
thine
own
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
repelled
the
offered
medicine
,
at
the
same
time
gazing
*NL*
with
strongly
marked
apprehension
into
his
face
.
``
Wouldst
thou
*NL*
avenge
thyself
on
the
innocent
babe
?
''
whispered
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Foolish
woman
!
''
responded
the
physician
,
half
coldly
,
half
*NL*
soothingly
.
``
What
should
ail
me
to
harm
this
misbegotten
and
*NL*
miserable
babe
?
The
medicine
is
potent
for
good
,
and
were
it
my
*NL*
child
--
yea
,
mine
own
,
as
well
as
thine
!
I
could
do
no
better
for
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
still
hesitated
,
being
,
in
fact
,
in
no
reasonable
state
*NL*
of
mind
,
he
took
the
infant
in
his
arms
,
and
himself
*NL*
administered
the
draught
.
It
soon
proved
its
efficacy
,
and
*NL*
redeemed
the
leech
's
pledge
.
The
moans
of
the
little
patient
*NL*
subsided
;
its
convulsive
tossings
gradually
ceased
;
and
in
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
as
is
the
custom
of
young
children
after
relief
from
*NL*
pain
,
it
sank
into
a
profound
and
dewy
slumber
.
The
physician
,
*NL*
as
he
had
a
fair
right
to
be
termed
,
next
bestowed
his
attention
*NL*
on
the
mother
.
With
calm
and
intent
scrutiny
,
he
felt
her
pulse
,
*NL*
looked
into
her
eyes
--
a
gaze
that
made
her
heart
shrink
and
*NL*
shudder
,
because
so
familiar
,
and
yet
so
strange
and
cold
--
and
,
*NL*
finally
,
satisfied
with
his
investigation
,
proceeded
to
mingle
*NL*
another
draught
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
Lethe
nor
Nepenthe
,
''
remarked
he
;
``
but
I
have
*NL*
learned
many
new
secrets
in
the
wilderness
,
and
here
is
one
of
*NL*
them
--
a
recipe
that
an
Indian
taught
me
,
in
requital
of
some
*NL*
lessons
of
my
own
,
that
were
as
old
as
Paracelsus
.
Drink
it
!
It
*NL*
may
be
less
soothing
than
a
sinless
conscience
.
That
I
can
not
*NL*
give
thee
.
But
it
will
calm
the
swell
and
heaving
of
thy
*NL*
passion
,
like
oil
thrown
on
the
waves
of
a
tempestuous
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
presented
the
cup
to
Hester
,
who
received
it
with
a
slow
,
*NL*
earnest
look
into
his
face
;
not
precisely
a
look
of
fear
,
yet
*NL*
full
of
doubt
and
questioning
as
to
what
his
purposes
might
be
.
*NL*
She
looked
also
at
her
slumbering
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
thought
of
death
,
''
said
she
--
``
have
wished
for
it
--
would
*NL*
even
have
prayed
for
it
,
were
it
fit
that
such
as
I
should
pray
*NL*
for
anything
.
Yet
,
if
death
be
in
this
cup
,
I
bid
thee
think
*NL*
again
,
ere
thou
beholdest
me
quaff
it
.
See
!
it
is
even
now
at
my
*NL*
lips
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
,
then
,
''
replied
he
,
still
with
the
same
cold
composure
.
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
know
me
so
little
,
Hester
Prynne
?
Are
my
purposes
*NL*
wont
to
be
so
shallow
?
Even
if
I
imagine
a
scheme
of
vengeance
,
*NL*
what
could
I
do
better
for
my
object
than
to
let
thee
live
--
than
*NL*
to
give
thee
medicines
against
all
harm
and
peril
of
life
--
so
*NL*
that
this
burning
shame
may
still
blaze
upon
thy
bosom
?
''
As
he
*NL*
spoke
,
he
laid
his
long
fore-finger
on
the
scarlet
letter
,
which
*NL*
forthwith
seemed
to
scorch
into
Hester
's
breast
,
as
if
it
had
*NL*
been
red
hot
.
He
noticed
her
involuntary
gesture
,
and
smiled
.
*NL*
``
Live
,
therefore
,
and
bear
about
thy
doom
with
thee
,
in
the
eyes
*NL*
of
men
and
women
--
in
the
eyes
of
him
whom
thou
didst
call
thy
*NL*
husband
--
in
the
eyes
of
yonder
child
!
And
,
that
thou
mayest
*NL*
live
,
take
off
this
draught
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
further
expostulation
or
delay
,
Hester
Prynne
drained
*NL*
the
cup
,
and
,
at
the
motion
of
the
man
of
skill
,
seated
herself
*NL*
on
the
bed
,
where
the
child
was
sleeping
;
while
he
drew
the
only
*NL*
chair
which
the
room
afforded
,
and
took
his
own
seat
beside
her
.
*NL*
She
could
not
but
tremble
at
these
preparations
;
for
she
felt
*NL*
that
--
having
now
done
all
that
humanity
,
or
principle
,
or
,
if
so
*NL*
it
were
,
a
refined
cruelty
,
impelled
him
to
do
for
the
relief
of
*NL*
physical
suffering
--
he
was
next
to
treat
with
her
as
the
man
*NL*
whom
she
had
most
deeply
and
irreparably
injured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hester
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
ask
not
wherefore
,
nor
how
thou
hast
*NL*
fallen
into
the
pit
,
or
say
,
rather
,
thou
hast
ascended
to
the
*NL*
pedestal
of
infamy
on
which
I
found
thee
.
The
reason
is
not
far
*NL*
to
seek
.
It
was
my
folly
,
and
thy
weakness
.
I
--
a
man
of
*NL*
thought
--
the
book-worm
of
great
libraries
--
a
man
already
in
*NL*
decay
,
having
given
my
best
years
to
feed
the
hungry
dream
of
*NL*
knowledge
--
what
had
I
to
do
with
youth
and
beauty
like
thine
*NL*
own
?
Misshapen
from
my
birth-hour
,
how
could
I
delude
myself
*NL*
with
the
idea
that
intellectual
gifts
might
veil
physical
*NL*
deformity
in
a
young
girl
's
fantasy
?
Men
call
me
wise
.
If
sages
*NL*
were
ever
wise
in
their
own
behoof
,
I
might
have
foreseen
all
*NL*
this
.
I
might
have
known
that
,
as
I
came
out
of
the
vast
and
*NL*
dismal
forest
,
and
entered
this
settlement
of
Christian
men
,
the
*NL*
very
first
object
to
meet
my
eyes
would
be
thyself
,
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
,
standing
up
,
a
statue
of
ignominy
,
before
the
people
.
*NL*
Nay
,
from
the
moment
when
we
came
down
the
old
church-steps
*NL*
together
,
a
married
pair
,
I
might
have
beheld
the
bale-fire
of
*NL*
that
scarlet
letter
blazing
at
the
end
of
our
path
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
knowest
,
''
said
Hester
--
for
,
depressed
as
she
was
,
she
*NL*
could
not
endure
this
last
quiet
stab
at
the
token
of
her
*NL*
shame
--
``
thou
knowest
that
I
was
frank
with
thee
.
I
felt
no
love
,
*NL*
nor
feigned
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
replied
he
.
``
It
was
my
folly
!
I
have
said
it
.
But
,
up
*NL*
to
that
epoch
of
my
life
,
I
had
lived
in
vain
.
The
world
had
*NL*
been
so
cheerless
!
My
heart
was
a
habitation
large
enough
for
*NL*
many
guests
,
but
lonely
and
chill
,
and
without
a
household
fire
.
*NL*
I
longed
to
kindle
one
!
It
seemed
not
so
wild
a
dream
--
old
as
I
*NL*
was
,
and
sombre
as
I
was
,
and
misshapen
as
I
was
--
that
the
*NL*
simple
bliss
,
which
is
scattered
far
and
wide
,
for
all
mankind
*NL*
to
gather
up
,
might
yet
be
mine
.
And
so
,
Hester
,
I
drew
thee
*NL*
into
my
heart
,
into
its
innermost
chamber
,
and
sought
to
warm
*NL*
thee
by
the
warmth
which
thy
presence
made
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
greatly
wronged
thee
,
''
murmured
Hester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
wronged
each
other
,
''
answered
he
.
``
Mine
was
the
first
*NL*
wrong
,
when
I
betrayed
thy
budding
youth
into
a
false
and
*NL*
unnatural
relation
with
my
decay
.
Therefore
,
as
a
man
who
has
*NL*
not
thought
and
philosophised
in
vain
,
I
seek
no
vengeance
,
plot
*NL*
no
evil
against
thee
.
Between
thee
and
me
,
the
scale
hangs
*NL*
fairly
balanced
.
But
,
Hester
,
the
man
lives
who
has
wronged
us
*NL*
both
!
Who
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
me
not
!
''
replied
Hester
Prynne
,
looking
firmly
into
his
*NL*
face
.
``
That
thou
shalt
never
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
sayest
thou
?
''
rejoined
he
,
with
a
smile
of
dark
and
*NL*
self-relying
intelligence
.
``
Never
know
him
!
Believe
me
,
Hester
,
*NL*
there
are
few
things
whether
in
the
outward
world
,
or
,
to
a
*NL*
certain
depth
,
in
the
invisible
sphere
of
thought
--
few
things
*NL*
hidden
from
the
man
who
devotes
himself
earnestly
and
*NL*
unreservedly
to
the
solution
of
a
mystery
.
Thou
mayest
cover
up
*NL*
thy
secret
from
the
prying
multitude
.
Thou
mayest
conceal
it
,
*NL*
too
,
from
the
ministers
and
magistrates
,
even
as
thou
didst
this
*NL*
day
,
when
they
sought
to
wrench
the
name
out
of
thy
heart
,
and
*NL*
give
thee
a
partner
on
thy
pedestal
.
But
,
as
for
me
,
I
come
to
*NL*
the
inquest
with
other
senses
than
they
possess
.
I
shall
seek
*NL*
this
man
,
as
I
have
sought
truth
in
books
:
as
I
have
sought
gold
*NL*
in
alchemy
.
There
is
a
sympathy
that
will
make
me
conscious
of
*NL*
him
.
I
shall
see
him
tremble
.
I
shall
feel
myself
shudder
,
*NL*
suddenly
and
unawares
.
Sooner
or
later
,
he
must
needs
be
mine

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
the
wrinkled
scholar
glowed
so
intensely
upon
her
,
*NL*
that
Hester
Prynne
clasped
her
hand
over
her
heart
,
dreading
*NL*
lest
he
should
read
the
secret
there
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
wilt
not
reveal
his
name
?
Not
the
less
he
is
mine

*NL*
resumed
he
,
with
a
look
of
confidence
,
as
if
destiny
were
at
one
*NL*
with
him
.
``
He
bears
no
letter
of
infamy
wrought
into
his

garment

as
thou
dost

but
I
shall
read
it
on
his
heart

Yet
*NL*
fear
not

Think
not

I
shall
interfere
with
Heaven
's

own
method
of
retribution

,
to
my
own
loss

betray
him
to
the
*NL*
gripe

human
law

Neither
do
thou
imagine
that
I

contrive
aught
against
his
life

no
,
nor
against
his
fame

as
*NL*
I
judge
,
he
be
a
man

fair
repute

himself

*NL*
``
Thy
acts
are
like
mercy

said
Hester
,
bewildered
and
appalled
;
*NL*
``

thy
words
interpret
thee
as
a
terror

``
One

the
scholar

shrinking

she

hardly
knew
why

from
this
secret
bond

Why
not

thyself
openly

cast
me
off
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may

he
replied

because

dishonour

may
be

V.
HESTER
AT
HER
NEEDLE
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
's
term
of
confinement
was
now
at
an
end
.
Her
*NL*
prison-door
was
thrown
open
,
and
she
came
forth
into
the
*NL*
sunshine
,
which
,
falling
on
all
alike
,
seemed
,
to
her
sick
and
*NL*
morbid
heart
,
as
if
meant
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
reveal
*NL*
the
scarlet
letter
on
her
breast
.
Perhaps
there
was
a
more
real
*NL*
torture
in
her
first
unattended
footsteps
from
the
threshold
of
*NL*
the
prison
than
even
in
the
procession
and
spectacle
that
have
*NL*
been
described
,
where
she
was
made
the
common
infamy
,
at
which
*NL*
all
mankind
was
summoned
to
point
its
finger
.
Then
,
she
was
*NL*
supported
by
an
unnatural
tension
of
the
nerves
,
and
by
all
the
*NL*
combative
energy
of
her
character
,
which
enabled
her
to
convert
*NL*
the
scene
into
a
kind
of
lurid
triumph
.
It
was
,
moreover
,
a
*NL*
separate
and
insulated
event
,
to
occur
but
once
in
her
lifetime
,
*NL*
and
to
meet
which
,
therefore
,
reckless
of
economy
,
she
might
*NL*
call
up
the
vital
strength
that
would
have
sufficed
for
many
*NL*
quiet
years
.
The
very
law
that
condemned
her
--
a
giant
of
stern
*NL*
features
but
with
vigour
to
support
,
as
well
as
to
annihilate
,
*NL*
in
his
iron
arm
--
had
held
her
up
through
the
terrible
ordeal
of
*NL*
her
ignominy
.
But
now
,
with
this
unattended
walk
from
her
prison
*NL*
door
,
began
the
daily
custom
;
and
she
must
either
sustain
and
*NL*
carry
it
forward
by
the
ordinary
resources
of
her
nature
,
or
*NL*
sink
beneath
it
.
She
could
no
longer
borrow
from
the
future
to
*NL*
help
her
through
the
present
grief
.
Tomorrow
would
bring
its
own
*NL*
trial
with
it
;
so
would
the
next
day
,
and
so
would
the
next
:
*NL*
each
its
own
trial
,
and
yet
the
very
same
that
was
now
so
*NL*
unutterably
grievous
to
be
borne
.
The
days
of
the
far-off
future
*NL*
would
toil
onward
,
still
with
the
same
burden
for
her
to
take
*NL*
up
,
and
bear
along
with
her
,
but
never
to
fling
down
;
for
the
*NL*
accumulating
days
and
added
years
would
pile
up
their
misery
*NL*
upon
the
heap
of
shame
.
Throughout
them
all
,
giving
up
her
*NL*
individuality
,
she
would
become
the
general
symbol
at
which
the
*NL*
preacher
and
moralist
might
point
,
and
in
which
they
might
*NL*
vivify
and
embody
their
images
of
woman
's
frailty
and
sinful
*NL*
passion
.
Thus
the
young
and
pure
would
be
taught
to
look
at
her
,
*NL*
with
the
scarlet
letter
flaming
on
her
breast
--
at
her
,
the
child
*NL*
of
honourable
parents
--
at
her
,
the
mother
of
a
babe
that
would
*NL*
hereafter
be
a
woman
--
at
her
,
who
had
once
been
innocent
--
as
the
*NL*
figure
,
the
body
,
the
reality
of
sin
.
And
over
her
grave
,
the
*NL*
infamy
that
she
must
carry
thither
would
be
her
only
monument
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
seem
marvellous
that
,
with
the
world
before
her
--
kept
by
*NL*
no
restrictive
clause
of
her
condemnation
within
the
limits
of
*NL*
the
Puritan
settlement
,
so
remote
and
so
obscure
--
free
to
return
*NL*
to
her
birth-place
,
or
to
any
other
European
land
,
and
there
*NL*
hide
her
character
and
identity
under
a
new
exterior
,
as
*NL*
completely
as
if
emerging
into
another
state
of
being
--
and
*NL*
having
also
the
passes
of
the
dark
,
inscrutable
forest
open
to
*NL*
her
,
where
the
wildness
of
her
nature
might
assimilate
itself
*NL*
with
a
people
whose
customs
and
life
were
alien
from
the
law
*NL*
that
had
condemned
her
--
it
may
seem
marvellous
that
this
woman
*NL*
should
still
call
that
place
her
home
,
where
,
and
where
only
,
*NL*
she
must
needs
be
the
type
of
shame
.
But
there
is
a
fatality
,
a
*NL*
feeling
so
irresistible
and
inevitable
that
it
has
the
force
of
*NL*
doom
,
which
almost
invariably
compels
human
beings
to
linger
*NL*
around
and
haunt
,
ghost-like
,
the
spot
where
some
great
and
*NL*
marked
event
has
given
the
colour
to
their
lifetime
;
and
,
still
*NL*
the
more
irresistibly
,
the
darker
the
tinge
that
saddens
it
.
Her
*NL*
sin
,
her
ignominy
,
were
the
roots
which
she
had
struck
into
the
*NL*
soil
.
It
was
as
if
a
new
birth
,
with
stronger
assimilations
than
*NL*
the
first
,
had
converted
the
forest-land
,
still
so
uncongenial
*NL*
to
every
other
pilgrim
and
wanderer
,
into
Hester
Prynne
's
wild
*NL*
and
dreary
,
but
life-long
home
.
All
other
scenes
of
earth
--
even
*NL*
that
village
of
rural
England
,
where
happy
infancy
and
stainless
*NL*
maidenhood
seemed
yet
to
be
in
her
mother
's
keeping
,
like
*NL*
garments
put
off
long
ago
--
were
foreign
to
her
,
in
comparison
.
*NL*
The
chain
that
bound
her
here
was
of
iron
links
,
and
galling
to
*NL*
her
inmost
soul
,
but
could
never
be
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
,
too
--
doubtless
it
was
so
,
although
she
hid
the
*NL*
secret
from
herself
,
and
grew
pale
whenever
it
struggled
out
of
*NL*
her
heart
,
like
a
serpent
from
its
hole
--
it
might
be
that
*NL*
another
feeling
kept
her
within
the
scene
and
pathway
that
had
*NL*
been
so
fatal
.
There
dwelt
,
there
trode
,
the
feet
of
one
with
*NL*
whom
she
deemed
herself
connected
in
a
union
that
,
unrecognised
*NL*
on
earth
,
would
bring
them
together
before
the
bar
of
final
*NL*
judgment
,
and
make
that
their
marriage-altar
,
for
a
joint
*NL*
futurity
of
endless
retribution
.
Over
and
over
again
,
the
*NL*
tempter
of
souls
had
thrust
this
idea
upon
Hester
's
*NL*
contemplation
,
and
laughed
at
the
passionate
and
desperate
joy
*NL*
with
which
she
seized
,
and
then
strove
to
cast
it
from
her
.
She
*NL*
barely
looked
the
idea
in
the
face
,
and
hastened
to
bar
it
in
*NL*
its
dungeon
.
What
she
compelled
herself
to
believe
--
what
,
*NL*
finally
,
she
reasoned
upon
as
her
motive
for
continuing
a
*NL*
resident
of
New
England
--
was
half
a
truth
,
and
half
a
*NL*
self-delusion
.
Here
,
she
said
to
herself
had
been
the
scene
of
*NL*
her
guilt
,
and
here
should
be
the
scene
of
her
earthly
*NL*
punishment
;
and
so
,
perchance
,
the
torture
of
her
daily
shame
*NL*
would
at
length
purge
her
soul
,
and
work
out
another
purity
than
*NL*
that
which
she
had
lost
:
more
saint-like
,
because
the
result
of
*NL*
martyrdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
,
therefore
,
did
not
flee
.
On
the
outskirts
of
the
*NL*
town
,
within
the
verge
of
the
peninsula
,
but
not
in
close
*NL*
vicinity
to
any
other
habitation
,
there
was
a
small
thatched
*NL*
cottage
.
It
had
been
built
by
an
earlier
settler
,
and
abandoned
,
*NL*
because
the
soil
about
it
was
too
sterile
for
cultivation
,
while
*NL*
its
comparative
remoteness
put
it
out
of
the
sphere
of
that
*NL*
social
activity
which
already
marked
the
habits
of
the
*NL*
emigrants
.
It
stood
on
the
shore
,
looking
across
a
basin
of
the
*NL*
sea
at
the
forest-covered
hills
,
towards
the
west
.
A
clump
of
*NL*
scrubby
trees
,
such
as
alone
grew
on
the
peninsula
,
did
not
so
*NL*
much
conceal
the
cottage
from
view
,
as
seem
to
denote
that
here
*NL*
was
some
object
which
would
fain
have
been
,
or
at
least
ought
to
*NL*
be
,
concealed
.
In
this
little
lonesome
dwelling
,
with
some
*NL*
slender
means
that
she
possessed
,
and
by
the
licence
of
the
*NL*
magistrates
,
who
still
kept
an
inquisitorial
watch
over
her
,
*NL*
Hester
established
herself
,
with
her
infant
child
.
A
mystic
*NL*
shadow
of
suspicion
immediately
attached
itself
to
the
spot
.
*NL*
Children
,
too
young
to
comprehend
wherefore
this
woman
should
be
*NL*
shut
out
from
the
sphere
of
human
charities
,
would
creep
nigh
*NL*
enough
to
behold
her
plying
her
needle
at
the
cottage-window
,
or
*NL*
standing
in
the
doorway
,
or
labouring
in
her
little
garden
,
or
*NL*
coming
forth
along
the
pathway
that
led
townward
,
and
,
*NL*
discerning
the
scarlet
letter
on
her
breast
,
would
scamper
off
*NL*
with
a
strange
contagious
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lonely
as
was
Hester
's
situation
,
and
without
a
friend
on
earth
*NL*
who
dared
to
show
himself
,
she
,
however
,
incurred
no
risk
of
*NL*
want
.
She
possessed
an
art
that
sufficed
,
even
in
a
land
that
*NL*
afforded
comparatively
little
scope
for
its
exercise
,
to
supply
*NL*
food
for
her
thriving
infant
and
herself
.
It
was
the
art
,
then
,
*NL*
as
now
,
almost
the
only
one
within
a
woman
's
grasp
--
of
*NL*
needle-work
.
She
bore
on
her
breast
,
in
the
curiously
*NL*
embroidered
letter
,
a
specimen
of
her
delicate
and
imaginative
*NL*
skill
,
of
which
the
dames
of
a
court
might
gladly
have
availed
*NL*
themselves
,
to
add
the
richer
and
more
spiritual
adornment
of
*NL*
human
ingenuity
to
their
fabrics
of
silk
and
gold
.
Here
,
indeed
,
*NL*
in
the
sable
simplicity
that
generally
characterised
the
*NL*
Puritanic
modes
of
dress
,
there
might
be
an
infrequent
call
for
*NL*
the
finer
productions
of
her
handiwork
.
Yet
the
taste
of
the
*NL*
age
,
demanding
whatever
was
elaborate
in
compositions
of
this
*NL*
kind
,
did
not
fail
to
extend
its
influence
over
our
stern
*NL*
progenitors
,
who
had
cast
behind
them
so
many
fashions
which
it
*NL*
might
seem
harder
to
dispense
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Public
ceremonies
,
such
as
ordinations
,
the
installation
of
*NL*
magistrates
,
and
all
that
could
give
majesty
to
the
forms
in
*NL*
which
a
new
government
manifested
itself
to
the
people
,
were
,
as
*NL*
a
matter
of
policy
,
marked
by
a
stately
and
well-conducted
*NL*
ceremonial
,
and
a
sombre
,
but
yet
a
studied
magnificence
.
Deep
*NL*
ruffs
,
painfully
wrought
bands
,
and
gorgeously
embroidered
*NL*
gloves
,
were
all
deemed
necessary
to
the
official
state
of
men
*NL*
assuming
the
reins
of
power
,
and
were
readily
allowed
to
*NL*
individuals
dignified
by
rank
or
wealth
,
even
while
sumptuary
*NL*
laws
forbade
these
and
similar
extravagances
to
the
plebeian
*NL*
order
.
In
the
array
of
funerals
,
too
--
whether
for
the
apparel
of
*NL*
the
dead
body
,
or
to
typify
,
by
manifold
emblematic
devices
of
*NL*
sable
cloth
and
snowy
lawn
,
the
sorrow
of
the
survivors
--
there
*NL*
was
a
frequent
and
characteristic
demand
for
such
labour
as
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
could
supply
.
Baby-linen
--
for
babies
then
wore
*NL*
robes
of
state
--
afforded
still
another
possibility
of
toil
and
*NL*
emolument
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
,
not
very
slowly
,
her
handiwork
became
what
would
now
*NL*
be
termed
the
fashion
.
Whether
from
commiseration
for
a
woman
of
*NL*
so
miserable
a
destiny
;
or
from
the
morbid
curiosity
that
gives
*NL*
a
fictitious
value
even
to
common
or
worthless
things
;
or
by
*NL*
whatever
other
intangible
circumstance
was
then
,
as
now
,
*NL*
sufficient
to
bestow
,
on
some
persons
,
what
others
might
seek
in
*NL*
vain
;
or
because
Hester
really
filled
a
gap
which
must
otherwise
*NL*
have
remained
vacant
;
it
is
certain
that
she
had
ready
and
*NL*
fairly
requited
employment
for
as
many
hours
as
she
saw
fit
to
*NL*
occupy
with
her
needle
.
Vanity
,
it
may
be
,
chose
to
mortify
*NL*
itself
,
by
putting
on
,
for
ceremonials
of
pomp
and
state
,
the
*NL*
garments
that
had
been
wrought
by
her
sinful
hands
.
Her
*NL*
needle-work
was
seen
on
the
ruff
of
the
Governor
;
military
men
*NL*
wore
it
on
their
scarfs
,
and
the
minister
on
his
band
;
it
decked
*NL*
the
baby
's
little
cap
;
it
was
shut
up
,
to
be
mildewed
and
*NL*
moulder
away
,
in
the
coffins
of
the
dead
.
But
it
is
not
recorded
*NL*
that
,
in
a
single
instance
,
her
skill
was
called
in
to
embroider
*NL*
the
white
veil
which
was
to
cover
the
pure
blushes
of
a
bride
.
*NL*
The
exception
indicated
the
ever
relentless
vigour
with
which
*NL*
society
frowned
upon
her
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
sought
not
to
acquire
anything
beyond
a
subsistence
,
of
*NL*
the
plainest
and
most
ascetic
description
,
for
herself
,
and
a
*NL*
simple
abundance
for
her
child
.
Her
own
dress
was
of
the
*NL*
coarsest
materials
and
the
most
sombre
hue
,
with
only
that
one
*NL*
ornament
--
the
scarlet
letter
--
which
it
was
her
doom
to
wear
.
The
*NL*
child
's
attire
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
distinguished
by
a
*NL*
fanciful
,
or
,
we
may
rather
say
,
a
fantastic
ingenuity
,
which
*NL*
served
,
indeed
,
to
heighten
the
airy
charm
that
early
began
to
*NL*
develop
itself
in
the
little
girl
,
but
which
appeared
to
have
*NL*
also
a
deeper
meaning
.
We
may
speak
further
of
it
hereafter
.
*NL*
Except
for
that
small
expenditure
in
the
decoration
of
her
*NL*
infant
,
Hester
bestowed
all
her
superfluous
means
in
charity
,
on
*NL*
wretches
less
miserable
than
herself
,
and
who
not
unfrequently
*NL*
insulted
the
hand
that
fed
them
.
Much
of
the
time
,
which
she
*NL*
might
readily
have
applied
to
the
better
efforts
of
her
art
,
she
*NL*
employed
in
making
coarse
garments
for
the
poor
.
It
is
probable
*NL*
that
there
was
an
idea
of
penance
in
this
mode
of
occupation
,
*NL*
and
that
she
offered
up
a
real
sacrifice
of
enjoyment
in
*NL*
devoting
so
many
hours
to
such
rude
handiwork
.
She
had
in
her
*NL*
nature
a
rich
,
voluptuous
,
Oriental
characteristic
--
a
taste
for
*NL*
the
gorgeously
beautiful
,
which
,
save
in
the
exquisite
*NL*
productions
of
her
needle
,
found
nothing
else
,
in
all
the
*NL*
possibilities
of
her
life
,
to
exercise
itself
upon
.
Women
derive
*NL*
a
pleasure
,
incomprehensible
to
the
other
sex
,
from
the
delicate
*NL*
toil
of
the
needle
.
To
Hester
Prynne
it
might
have
been
a
mode
*NL*
of
expressing
,
and
therefore
soothing
,
the
passion
of
her
life
.
*NL*
Like
all
other
joys
,
she
rejected
it
as
sin
.
This
morbid
*NL*
meddling
of
conscience
with
an
immaterial
matter
betokened
,
it
*NL*
is
to
be
feared
,
no
genuine
and
steadfast
penitence
,
but
*NL*
something
doubtful
,
something
that
might
be
deeply
wrong
*NL*
beneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
,
Hester
Prynne
came
to
have
a
part
to
perform
in
*NL*
the
world
.
With
her
native
energy
of
character
and
rare
*NL*
capacity
,
it
could
not
entirely
cast
her
off
,
although
it
had
*NL*
set
a
mark
upon
her
,
more
intolerable
to
a
woman
's
heart
than
*NL*
that
which
branded
the
brow
of
Cain
.
In
all
her
intercourse
with
*NL*
society
,
however
,
there
was
nothing
that
made
her
feel
as
if
she
*NL*
belonged
to
it
.
Every
gesture
,
every
word
,
and
even
the
silence
*NL*
of
those
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
,
implied
,
and
often
*NL*
expressed
,
that
she
was
banished
,
and
as
much
alone
as
if
she
*NL*
inhabited
another
sphere
,
or
communicated
with
the
common
nature
*NL*
by
other
organs
and
senses
than
the
rest
of
human
kind
.
She
*NL*
stood
apart
from
mortal
interests
,
yet
close
beside
them
,
like
a
*NL*
ghost
that
revisits
the
familiar
fireside
,
and
can
no
longer
*NL*
make
itself
seen
or
felt
;
no
more
smile
with
the
household
joy
,
*NL*
nor
mourn
with
the
kindred
sorrow
;
or
,
should
it
succeed
in
*NL*
manifesting
its
forbidden
sympathy
,
awakening
only
terror
and
*NL*
horrible
repugnance
.
These
emotions
,
in
fact
,
and
its
bitterest
*NL*
scorn
besides
,
seemed
to
be
the
sole
portion
that
she
retained
*NL*
in
the
universal
heart
.
It
was
not
an
age
of
delicacy
;
and
her
*NL*
position
,
although
she
understood
it
well
,
and
was
in
little
*NL*
danger
of
forgetting
it
,
was
often
brought
before
her
vivid
*NL*
self-perception
,
like
a
new
anguish
,
by
the
rudest
touch
upon
*NL*
the
tenderest
spot
.
The
poor
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
whom
she
*NL*
sought
out
to
be
the
objects
of
her
bounty
,
often
reviled
the
*NL*
hand
that
was
stretched
forth
to
succour
them
.
Dames
of
elevated
*NL*
rank
,
likewise
,
whose
doors
she
entered
in
the
way
of
her
*NL*
occupation
,
were
accustomed
to
distil
drops
of
bitterness
into
*NL*
her
heart
;
sometimes
through
that
alchemy
of
quiet
malice
,
by
*NL*
which
women
can
concoct
a
subtle
poison
from
ordinary
trifles
;
*NL*
and
sometimes
,
also
,
by
a
coarser
expression
,
that
fell
upon
the
*NL*
sufferer
's
defenceless
breast
like
a
rough
blow
upon
an
*NL*
ulcerated
wound
.
Hester
had
schooled
herself
long
and
well
;
and
*NL*
she
never
responded
to
these
attacks
,
save
by
a
flush
of
crimson
*NL*
that
rose
irrepressibly
over
her
pale
cheek
,
and
again
subsided
*NL*
into
the
depths
of
her
bosom
.
She
was
patient
--
a
martyr
,
indeed
*NL*
but
she
forebore
to
pray
for
enemies
,
lest
,
in
spite
of
her
*NL*
forgiving
aspirations
,
the
words
of
the
blessing
should
*NL*
stubbornly
twist
themselves
into
a
curse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Continually
,
and
in
a
thousand
other
ways
,
did
she
feel
the
*NL*
innumerable
throbs
of
anguish
that
had
been
so
cunningly
*NL*
contrived
for
her
by
the
undying
,
the
ever-active
sentence
of
*NL*
the
Puritan
tribunal
.
Clergymen
paused
in
the
streets
,
to
*NL*
address
words
of
exhortation
,
that
brought
a
crowd
,
with
its
*NL*
mingled
grin
and
frown
,
around
the
poor
,
sinful
woman
.
If
she
*NL*
entered
a
church
,
trusting
to
share
the
Sabbath
smile
of
the
*NL*
Universal
Father
,
it
was
often
her
mishap
to
find
herself
the
*NL*
text
of
the
discourse
.
She
grew
to
have
a
dread
of
children
;
for
*NL*
they
had
imbibed
from
their
parents
a
vague
idea
of
something
*NL*
horrible
in
this
dreary
woman
gliding
silently
through
the
town
,
*NL*
with
never
any
companion
but
one
only
child
.
Therefore
,
first
*NL*
allowing
her
to
pass
,
they
pursued
her
at
a
distance
with
shrill
*NL*
cries
,
and
the
utterances
of
a
word
that
had
no
distinct
purport
*NL*
to
their
own
minds
,
but
was
none
the
less
terrible
to
her
,
as
*NL*
proceeding
from
lips
that
babbled
it
unconsciously
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
argue
so
wide
a
diffusion
of
her
shame
,
that
all
nature
knew
of
*NL*
it
;
it
could
have
caused
her
no
deeper
pang
had
the
leaves
of
*NL*
the
trees
whispered
the
dark
story
among
themselves
--
had
the
*NL*
summer
breeze
murmured
about
it
--
had
the
wintry
blast
shrieked
*NL*
it
aloud
!
Another
peculiar
torture
was
felt
in
the
gaze
of
a
new
*NL*
eye
.
When
strangers
looked
curiously
at
the
scarlet
letter
and
*NL*
none
ever
failed
to
do
so
--
they
branded
it
afresh
in
Hester
's
*NL*
soul
;
so
that
,
oftentimes
,
she
could
scarcely
refrain
,
yet
*NL*
always
did
refrain
,
from
covering
the
symbol
with
her
hand
.
But
*NL*
then
,
again
,
an
accustomed
eye
had
likewise
its
own
anguish
to
*NL*
inflict
.
Its
cool
stare
of
familiarity
was
intolerable
.
From
*NL*
first
to
last
,
in
short
,
Hester
Prynne
had
always
this
dreadful
*NL*
agony
in
feeling
a
human
eye
upon
the
token
;
the
spot
never
grew
*NL*
callous
;
it
seemed
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
grow
more
sensitive
with
*NL*
daily
torture
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
sometimes
,
once
in
many
days
,
or
perchance
in
many
months
,
*NL*
she
felt
an
eye
--
a
human
eye
--
upon
the
ignominious
brand
,
that
*NL*
seemed
to
give
a
momentary
relief
,
as
if
half
of
her
agony
were
*NL*
shared
.
The
next
instant
,
back
it
all
rushed
again
,
with
still
a
*NL*
deeper
throb
of
pain
;
for
,
in
that
brief
interval
,
she
had
*NL*
sinned
anew
.
-LRB-
Had
Hester
sinned
alone
?
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Her
imagination
was
somewhat
affected
,
and
,
had
she
been
of
a
*NL*
softer
moral
and
intellectual
fibre
would
have
been
still
more
*NL*
so
,
by
the
strange
and
solitary
anguish
of
her
life
.
Walking
to
*NL*
and
fro
,
with
those
lonely
footsteps
,
in
the
little
world
with
*NL*
which
she
was
outwardly
connected
,
it
now
and
then
appeared
to
*NL*
Hester
--
if
altogether
fancy
,
it
was
nevertheless
too
potent
to
*NL*
be
resisted
--
she
felt
or
fancied
,
then
,
that
the
scarlet
letter
*NL*
had
endowed
her
with
a
new
sense
.
She
shuddered
to
believe
,
yet
*NL*
could
not
help
believing
,
that
it
gave
her
a
sympathetic
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
hidden
sin
in
other
hearts
.
She
was
*NL*
terror-stricken
by
the
revelations
that
were
thus
made
.
What
were
*NL*
they
?
Could
they
be
other
than
the
insidious
whispers
of
the
bad
*NL*
angel
,
who
would
fain
have
persuaded
the
struggling
woman
,
as
*NL*
yet
only
half
his
victim
,
that
the
outward
guise
of
purity
was
*NL*
but
a
lie
,
and
that
,
if
truth
were
everywhere
to
be
shown
,
a
*NL*
scarlet
letter
would
blaze
forth
on
many
a
bosom
besides
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
's
?
Or
,
must
she
receive
those
intimations
--
so
obscure
,
*NL*
yet
so
distinct
--
as
truth
?
In
all
her
miserable
experience
,
*NL*
there
was
nothing
else
so
awful
and
so
loathsome
as
this
sense
.
*NL*
It
perplexed
,
as
well
as
shocked
her
,
by
the
irreverent
*NL*
inopportuneness
of
the
occasions
that
brought
it
into
vivid
*NL*
action
.
Sometimes
the
red
infamy
upon
her
breast
would
give
a
*NL*
sympathetic
throb
,
as
she
passed
near
a
venerable
minister
or
*NL*
magistrate
,
the
model
of
piety
and
justice
,
to
whom
that
age
of
*NL*
antique
reverence
looked
up
,
as
to
a
mortal
man
in
fellowship
*NL*
with
angels
.
``
What
evil
thing
is
at
hand
?
''
would
Hester
say
to
*NL*
herself
.
Lifting
her
reluctant
eyes
,
there
would
be
nothing
*NL*
human
within
the
scope
of
view
,
save
the
form
of
this
earthly
*NL*
saint
!
Again
a
mystic
sisterhood
would
contumaciously
assert
*NL*
itself
,
as
she
met
the
sanctified
frown
of
some
matron
,
who
,
*NL*
according
to
the
rumour
of
all
tongues
,
had
kept
cold
snow
*NL*
within
her
bosom
throughout
life
.
That
unsunned
snow
in
the
*NL*
matron
's
bosom
,
and
the
burning
shame
on
Hester
Prynne
's
--
what
*NL*
had
the
two
in
common
?
Or
,
once
more
,
the
electric
thrill
would
*NL*
give
her
warning
--
``
Behold
Hester
,
here
is
a
companion
!
''
and
,
*NL*
looking
up
,
she
would
detect
the
eyes
of
a
young
maiden
glancing
*NL*
at
the
scarlet
letter
,
shyly
and
aside
,
and
quickly
averted
,
*NL*
with
a
faint
,
chill
crimson
in
her
cheeks
as
if
her
purity
were
*NL*
somewhat
sullied
by
that
momentary
glance
.
O
Fiend
,
whose
*NL*
talisman
was
that
fatal
symbol
,
wouldst
thou
leave
nothing
,
*NL*
whether
in
youth
or
age
,
for
this
poor
sinner
to
revere
?
--
such
*NL*
loss
of
faith
is
ever
one
of
the
saddest
results
of
sin
.
Be
it
*NL*
accepted
as
a
proof
that
all
was
not
corrupt
in
this
poor
victim
*NL*
of
her
own
frailty
,
and
man
's
hard
law
,
that
Hester
Prynne
yet
*NL*
struggled
to
believe
that
no
fellow-mortal
was
guilty
like
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vulgar
,
who
,
in
those
dreary
old
times
,
were
always
*NL*
contributing
a
grotesque
horror
to
what
interested
their
*NL*
imaginations
,
had
a
story
about
the
scarlet
letter
which
we
*NL*
might
readily
work
up
into
a
terrific
legend
.
They
averred
that
*NL*
the
symbol
was
not
mere
scarlet
cloth
,
tinged
in
an
earthly
*NL*
dye-pot
,
but
was
red-hot
with
infernal
fire
,
and
could
be
seen
*NL*
glowing
all
alight
whenever
Hester
Prynne
walked
abroad
in
the
*NL*
night-time
.
And
we
must
needs
say
it
seared
Hester
's
bosom
so
*NL*
deeply
,
that
perhaps
there
was
more
truth
in
the
rumour
than
our
*NL*
modern
incredulity
may
be
inclined
to
admit
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
.
PEARL
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
as
yet
hardly
spoken
of
the
infant
;
that
little
*NL*
creature
,
whose
innocent
life
had
sprung
,
by
the
inscrutable
*NL*
decree
of
Providence
,
a
lovely
and
immortal
flower
,
out
of
the
*NL*
rank
luxuriance
of
a
guilty
passion
.
How
strange
it
seemed
to
*NL*
the
sad
woman
,
as
she
watched
the
growth
,
and
the
beauty
that
*NL*
became
every
day
more
brilliant
,
and
the
intelligence
that
threw
*NL*
its
quivering
sunshine
over
the
tiny
features
of
this
child
!
Her
*NL*
Pearl
--
for
so
had
Hester
called
her
;
not
as
a
name
expressive
of
*NL*
her
aspect
,
which
had
nothing
of
the
calm
,
white
,
unimpassioned
*NL*
lustre
that
would
be
indicated
by
the
comparison
.
But
she
named
*NL*
the
infant
``
Pearl
,
''
as
being
of
great
price
--
purchased
with
all
*NL*
she
had
--
her
mother
's
only
treasure
!
How
strange
,
indeed
!
Man
*NL*
had
marked
this
woman
's
sin
by
a
scarlet
letter
,
which
had
such
*NL*
potent
and
disastrous
efficacy
that
no
human
sympathy
could
*NL*
reach
her
,
save
it
were
sinful
like
herself
.
God
,
as
a
direct
*NL*
consequence
of
the
sin
which
man
thus
punished
,
had
given
her
a
*NL*
lovely
child
,
whose
place
was
on
that
same
dishonoured
bosom
,
to
*NL*
connect
her
parent
for
ever
with
the
race
and
descent
of
*NL*
mortals
,
and
to
be
finally
a
blessed
soul
in
heaven
!
Yet
these
*NL*
thoughts
affected
Hester
Prynne
less
with
hope
than
*NL*
apprehension
.
She
knew
that
her
deed
had
been
evil
;
she
could
*NL*
have
no
faith
,
therefore
,
that
its
result
would
be
good
.
Day
*NL*
after
day
she
looked
fearfully
into
the
child
's
expanding
*NL*
nature
,
ever
dreading
to
detect
some
dark
and
wild
peculiarity
*NL*
that
should
correspond
with
the
guiltiness
to
which
she
owed
her
*NL*
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
there
was
no
physical
defect
.
By
its
perfect
shape
,
*NL*
its
vigour
,
and
its
natural
dexterity
in
the
use
of
all
its
*NL*
untried
limbs
,
the
infant
was
worthy
to
have
been
brought
forth
*NL*
in
Eden
:
worthy
to
have
been
left
there
to
be
the
plaything
of
*NL*
the
angels
after
the
world
's
first
parents
were
driven
out
.
The
*NL*
child
had
a
native
grace
which
does
not
invariably
co-exist
with
*NL*
faultless
beauty
;
its
attire
,
however
simple
,
always
impressed
*NL*
the
beholder
as
if
it
were
the
very
garb
that
precisely
became
*NL*
it
best
.
But
little
Pearl
was
not
clad
in
rustic
weeds
.
Her
*NL*
mother
,
with
a
morbid
purpose
that
may
be
better
understood
*NL*
hereafter
,
had
bought
the
richest
tissues
that
could
be
*NL*
procured
,
and
allowed
her
imaginative
faculty
its
full
play
in
*NL*
the
arrangement
and
decoration
of
the
dresses
which
the
child
*NL*
wore
before
the
public
eye
.
So
magnificent
was
the
small
figure
*NL*
when
thus
arrayed
,
and
such
was
the
splendour
of
Pearl
's
own
*NL*
proper
beauty
,
shining
through
the
gorgeous
robes
which
might
*NL*
have
extinguished
a
paler
loveliness
,
that
there
was
an
absolute
*NL*
circle
of
radiance
around
her
on
the
darksome
cottage
floor
.
And
*NL*
yet
a
russet
gown
,
torn
and
soiled
with
the
child
's
rude
play
,
*NL*
made
a
picture
of
her
just
as
perfect
.
Pearl
's
aspect
was
imbued
*NL*
with
a
spell
of
infinite
variety
;
in
this
one
child
there
were
*NL*
many
children
,
comprehending
the
full
scope
between
the
*NL*
wild-flower
prettiness
of
a
peasant-baby
,
and
the
pomp
,
in
*NL*
little
,
of
an
infant
princess
.
Throughout
all
,
however
,
there
*NL*
was
a
trait
of
passion
,
a
certain
depth
of
hue
,
which
she
never
*NL*
lost
;
and
if
in
any
of
her
changes
,
she
had
grown
fainter
or
*NL*
paler
,
she
would
have
ceased
to
be
herself
--
it
would
have
been
*NL*
no
longer
Pearl
!
*NL*
*NL*
This
outward
mutability
indicated
,
and
did
not
more
than
fairly
*NL*
express
,
the
various
properties
of
her
inner
life
.
Her
nature
*NL*
appeared
to
possess
depth
,
too
,
as
well
as
variety
;
but
--
or
else
*NL*
Hester
's
fears
deceived
her
--
it
lacked
reference
and
adaptation
*NL*
to
the
world
into
which
she
was
born
.
The
child
could
not
be
*NL*
made
amenable
to
rules
.
In
giving
her
existence
a
great
law
had
*NL*
been
broken
;
and
the
result
was
a
being
whose
elements
were
*NL*
perhaps
beautiful
and
brilliant
,
but
all
in
disorder
,
or
with
an
*NL*
order
peculiar
to
themselves
,
amidst
which
the
point
of
variety
*NL*
and
arrangement
was
difficult
or
impossible
to
be
discovered
.
*NL*
Hester
could
only
account
for
the
child
's
character
--
and
even
*NL*
then
most
vaguely
and
imperfectly
--
by
recalling
what
she
herself
*NL*
had
been
during
that
momentous
period
while
Pearl
was
imbibing
*NL*
her
soul
from
the
spiritual
world
,
and
her
bodily
frame
from
its
*NL*
material
of
earth
.
The
mother
's
impassioned
state
had
been
the
*NL*
medium
through
which
were
transmitted
to
the
unborn
infant
the
*NL*
rays
of
its
moral
life
;
and
,
however
white
and
clear
originally
,
*NL*
they
had
taken
the
deep
stains
of
crimson
and
gold
,
the
fiery
*NL*
lustre
,
the
black
shadow
,
and
the
untempered
light
of
the
*NL*
intervening
substance
.
Above
all
,
the
warfare
of
Hester
's
spirit
*NL*
at
that
epoch
was
perpetuated
in
Pearl
.
She
could
recognize
her
*NL*
wild
,
desperate
,
defiant
mood
,
the
flightiness
of
her
temper
,
*NL*
and
even
some
of
the
very
cloud-shapes
of
gloom
and
despondency
*NL*
that
had
brooded
in
her
heart
.
They
were
now
illuminated
by
the
*NL*
morning
radiance
of
a
young
child
's
disposition
,
but
,
later
in
*NL*
the
day
of
earthly
existence
,
might
be
prolific
of
the
storm
and
*NL*
whirlwind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
discipline
of
the
family
in
those
days
was
of
a
far
more
*NL*
rigid
kind
than
now
.
The
frown
,
the
harsh
rebuke
,
the
frequent
*NL*
application
of
the
rod
,
enjoined
by
Scriptural
authority
,
were
*NL*
used
,
not
merely
in
the
way
of
punishment
for
actual
offences
,
*NL*
but
as
a
wholesome
regimen
for
the
growth
and
promotion
of
all
*NL*
childish
virtues
.
Hester
Prynne
,
nevertheless
,
the
loving
mother
*NL*
of
this
one
child
,
ran
little
risk
of
erring
on
the
side
of
*NL*
undue
severity
.
Mindful
,
however
,
of
her
own
errors
and
*NL*
misfortunes
,
she
early
sought
to
impose
a
tender
but
strict
*NL*
control
over
the
infant
immortality
that
was
committed
to
her
*NL*
charge
.
But
the
task
was
beyond
her
skill
.
After
testing
both
*NL*
smiles
and
frowns
,
and
proving
that
neither
mode
of
treatment
*NL*
possessed
any
calculable
influence
,
Hester
was
ultimately
*NL*
compelled
to
stand
aside
and
permit
the
child
to
be
swayed
by
*NL*
her
own
impulses
.
Physical
compulsion
or
restraint
was
*NL*
effectual
,
of
course
,
while
it
lasted
.
As
to
any
other
kind
of
*NL*
discipline
,
whether
addressed
to
her
mind
or
heart
,
little
Pearl
*NL*
might
or
might
not
be
within
its
reach
,
in
accordance
with
the
*NL*
caprice
that
ruled
the
moment
.
Her
mother
,
while
Pearl
was
yet
*NL*
an
infant
,
grew
acquainted
with
a
certain
peculiar
look
,
that
*NL*
warned
her
when
it
would
be
labour
thrown
away
to
insist
,
*NL*
persuade
or
plead
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
look
so
intelligent
,
yet
inexplicable
,
perverse
,
*NL*
sometimes
so
malicious
,
but
generally
accompanied
by
a
wild
flow
*NL*
of
spirits
,
that
Hester
could
not
help
questioning
at
such
*NL*
moments
whether
Pearl
was
a
human
child
.
She
seemed
rather
an
*NL*
airy
sprite
,
which
,
after
playing
its
fantastic
sports
for
a
*NL*
little
while
upon
the
cottage
floor
,
would
flit
away
with
a
*NL*
mocking
smile
.
Whenever
that
look
appeared
in
her
wild
,
bright
,
*NL*
deeply
black
eyes
,
it
invested
her
with
a
strange
remoteness
and
*NL*
intangibility
:
it
was
as
if
she
were
hovering
in
the
air
,
and
*NL*
might
vanish
,
like
a
glimmering
light
that
comes
we
know
not
*NL*
whence
and
goes
we
know
not
whither
.
Beholding
it
,
Hester
was
*NL*
constrained
to
rush
towards
the
child
--
to
pursue
the
little
elf
*NL*
in
the
flight
which
she
invariably
began
--
to
snatch
her
to
her
*NL*
bosom
with
a
close
pressure
and
earnest
kisses
--
not
so
much
from
*NL*
overflowing
love
as
to
assure
herself
that
Pearl
was
flesh
and
*NL*
blood
,
and
not
utterly
delusive
.
But
Pearl
's
laugh
,
when
she
was
*NL*
caught
,
though
full
of
merriment
and
music
,
made
her
mother
more
*NL*
doubtful
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heart-smitten
at
this
bewildering
and
baffling
spell
,
that
so
*NL*
often
came
between
herself
and
her
sole
treasure
,
whom
she
had
*NL*
bought
so
dear
,
and
who
was
all
her
world
,
Hester
sometimes
*NL*
burst
into
passionate
tears
.
Then
,
perhaps
--
for
there
was
no
*NL*
foreseeing
how
it
might
affect
her
--
Pearl
would
frown
,
and
*NL*
clench
her
little
fist
,
and
harden
her
small
features
into
a
*NL*
stern
,
unsympathising
look
of
discontent
.
Not
seldom
she
would
*NL*
laugh
anew
,
and
louder
than
before
,
like
a
thing
incapable
and
*NL*
unintelligent
of
human
sorrow
.
Or
--
but
this
more
rarely
*NL*
happened
--
she
would
be
convulsed
with
rage
of
grief
and
sob
out
*NL*
her
love
for
her
mother
in
broken
words
,
and
seem
intent
on
*NL*
proving
that
she
had
a
heart
by
breaking
it
.
Yet
Hester
was
*NL*
hardly
safe
in
confiding
herself
to
that
gusty
tenderness
:
it
*NL*
passed
as
suddenly
as
it
came
.
Brooding
over
all
these
matters
,
*NL*
the
mother
felt
like
one
who
has
evoked
a
spirit
,
but
,
by
some
*NL*
irregularity
in
the
process
of
conjuration
,
has
failed
to
win
*NL*
the
master-word
that
should
control
this
new
and
*NL*
incomprehensible
intelligence
.
Her
only
real
comfort
was
when
*NL*
the
child
lay
in
the
placidity
of
sleep
.
Then
she
was
sure
of
*NL*
her
,
and
tasted
hours
of
quiet
,
sad
,
delicious
happiness
;
*NL*
until
--
perhaps
with
that
perverse
expression
glimmering
from
*NL*
beneath
her
opening
lids
--
little
Pearl
awoke
!
*NL*
*NL*
How
soon
--
with
what
strange
rapidity
,
indeed
did
Pearl
arrive
at
*NL*
an
age
that
was
capable
of
social
intercourse
beyond
the
*NL*
mother
's
ever-ready
smile
and
nonsense-words
!
And
then
what
a
*NL*
happiness
would
it
have
been
could
Hester
Prynne
have
heard
her
*NL*
clear
,
bird-like
voice
mingling
with
the
uproar
of
other
*NL*
childish
voices
,
and
have
distinguished
and
unravelled
her
own
*NL*
darling
's
tones
,
amid
all
the
entangled
outcry
of
a
group
of
*NL*
sportive
children
.
But
this
could
never
be
.
Pearl
was
a
born
*NL*
outcast
of
the
infantile
world
.
An
imp
of
evil
,
emblem
and
*NL*
product
of
sin
,
she
had
no
right
among
christened
infants
.
*NL*
Nothing
was
more
remarkable
than
the
instinct
,
as
it
seemed
,
*NL*
with
which
the
child
comprehended
her
loneliness
:
the
destiny
*NL*
that
had
drawn
an
inviolable
circle
round
about
her
:
the
whole
*NL*
peculiarity
,
in
short
,
of
her
position
in
respect
to
other
*NL*
children
.
Never
since
her
release
from
prison
had
Hester
met
the
*NL*
public
gaze
without
her
.
In
all
her
walks
about
the
town
,
Pearl
,
*NL*
too
,
was
there
:
first
as
the
babe
in
arms
,
and
afterwards
as
the
*NL*
little
girl
,
small
companion
of
her
mother
,
holding
a
forefinger
*NL*
with
her
whole
grasp
,
and
tripping
along
at
the
rate
of
three
or
*NL*
four
footsteps
to
one
of
Hester
's
.
She
saw
the
children
of
the
*NL*
settlement
on
the
grassy
margin
of
the
street
,
or
at
the
*NL*
domestic
thresholds
,
disporting
themselves
in
such
grim
fashions
*NL*
as
the
Puritanic
nurture
would
permit
;
playing
at
going
to
*NL*
church
,
perchance
,
or
at
scourging
Quakers
;
or
taking
scalps
in
*NL*
a
sham
fight
with
the
Indians
,
or
scaring
one
another
with
*NL*
freaks
of
imitative
witchcraft
.
Pearl
saw
,
and
gazed
intently
,
*NL*
but
never
sought
to
make
acquaintance
.
If
spoken
to
,
she
would
*NL*
not
speak
again
.
If
the
children
gathered
about
her
,
as
they
*NL*
sometimes
did
,
Pearl
would
grow
positively
terrible
in
her
puny
*NL*
wrath
,
snatching
up
stones
to
fling
at
them
,
with
shrill
,
*NL*
incoherent
exclamations
,
that
made
her
mother
tremble
,
because
*NL*
they
had
so
much
the
sound
of
a
witch
's
anathemas
in
some
*NL*
unknown
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
was
,
that
the
little
Puritans
,
being
of
the
most
*NL*
intolerant
brood
that
ever
lived
,
had
got
a
vague
idea
of
*NL*
something
outlandish
,
unearthly
,
or
at
variance
with
ordinary
*NL*
fashions
,
in
the
mother
and
child
,
and
therefore
scorned
them
in
*NL*
their
hearts
,
and
not
unfrequently
reviled
them
with
their
*NL*
tongues
.
Pearl
felt
the
sentiment
,
and
requited
it
with
the
*NL*
bitterest
hatred
that
can
be
supposed
to
rankle
in
a
childish
*NL*
bosom
.
These
outbreaks
of
a
fierce
temper
had
a
kind
of
value
,
*NL*
and
even
comfort
for
the
mother
;
because
there
was
at
least
an
*NL*
intelligible
earnestness
in
the
mood
,
instead
of
the
fitful
*NL*
caprice
that
so
often
thwarted
her
in
the
child
's
*NL*
manifestations
.
It
appalled
her
,
nevertheless
,
to
discern
here
,
*NL*
again
,
a
shadowy
reflection
of
the
evil
that
had
existed
in
*NL*
herself
.
All
this
enmity
and
passion
had
Pearl
inherited
,
by
*NL*
inalienable
right
,
out
of
Hester
's
heart
.
Mother
and
daughter
*NL*
stood
together
in
the
same
circle
of
seclusion
from
human
*NL*
society
;
and
in
the
nature
of
the
child
seemed
to
be
perpetuated
*NL*
those
unquiet
elements
that
had
distracted
Hester
Prynne
before
*NL*
Pearl
's
birth
,
but
had
since
begun
to
be
soothed
away
by
the
*NL*
softening
influences
of
maternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
home
,
within
and
around
her
mother
's
cottage
,
Pearl
wanted
*NL*
not
a
wide
and
various
circle
of
acquaintance
.
The
spell
of
life
*NL*
went
forth
from
her
ever-creative
spirit
,
and
communicated
*NL*
itself
to
a
thousand
objects
,
as
a
torch
kindles
a
flame
*NL*
wherever
it
may
be
applied
.
The
unlikeliest
materials
--
a
stick
,
*NL*
a
bunch
of
rags
,
a
flower
--
were
the
puppets
of
Pearl
's
*NL*
witchcraft
,
and
,
without
undergoing
any
outward
change
,
became
*NL*
spiritually
adapted
to
whatever
drama
occupied
the
stage
of
her
*NL*
inner
world
.
Her
one
baby-voice
served
a
multitude
of
imaginary
*NL*
personages
,
old
and
young
,
to
talk
withal
.
The
pine-trees
,
aged
,
*NL*
black
,
and
solemn
,
and
flinging
groans
and
other
melancholy
*NL*
utterances
on
the
breeze
,
needed
little
transformation
to
figure
*NL*
as
Puritan
elders
;
the
ugliest
weeds
of
the
garden
were
their
*NL*
children
,
whom
Pearl
smote
down
and
uprooted
most
unmercifully
.
*NL*
It
was
wonderful
,
the
vast
variety
of
forms
into
which
she
threw
*NL*
her
intellect
,
with
no
continuity
,
indeed
,
but
darting
up
and
*NL*
dancing
,
always
in
a
state
of
preternatural
activity
--
soon
*NL*
sinking
down
,
as
if
exhausted
by
so
rapid
and
feverish
a
tide
of
*NL*
life
--
and
succeeded
by
other
shapes
of
a
similar
wild
energy
.
It
*NL*
was
like
nothing
so
much
as
the
phantasmagoric
play
of
the
*NL*
northern
lights
.
In
the
mere
exercise
of
the
fancy
,
however
,
and
*NL*
the
sportiveness
of
a
growing
mind
,
there
might
be
a
little
more
*NL*
than
was
observable
in
other
children
of
bright
faculties
;
*NL*
except
as
Pearl
,
in
the
dearth
of
human
playmates
,
was
thrown
*NL*
more
upon
the
visionary
throng
which
she
created
.
The
*NL*
singularity
lay
in
the
hostile
feelings
with
which
the
child
*NL*
regarded
all
these
offsprings
of
her
own
heart
and
mind
.
She
*NL*
never
created
a
friend
,
but
seemed
always
to
be
sowing
broadcast
*NL*
the
dragon
's
teeth
,
whence
sprung
a
harvest
of
armed
enemies
,
*NL*
against
whom
she
rushed
to
battle
.
It
was
inexpressibly
*NL*
sad
--
then
what
depth
of
sorrow
to
a
mother
,
who
felt
in
her
own
*NL*
heart
the
cause
--
to
observe
,
in
one
so
young
,
this
constant
*NL*
recognition
of
an
adverse
world
,
and
so
fierce
a
training
of
the
*NL*
energies
that
were
to
make
good
her
cause
in
the
contest
that
*NL*
must
ensue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gazing
at
Pearl
,
Hester
Prynne
often
dropped
her
work
upon
her
*NL*
knees
,
and
cried
out
with
an
agony
which
she
would
fain
have
*NL*
hidden
,
but
which
made
utterance
for
itself
betwixt
speech
and
a
*NL*
groan
--
``
O
Father
in
Heaven
--
if
Thou
art
still
my
Father
--
what
is
*NL*
this
being
which
I
have
brought
into
the
world
?
''
And
Pearl
,
*NL*
overhearing
the
ejaculation
,
or
aware
through
some
more
subtile
*NL*
channel
,
of
those
throbs
of
anguish
,
would
turn
her
vivid
and
*NL*
beautiful
little
face
upon
her
mother
,
smile
with
sprite-like
*NL*
intelligence
,
and
resume
her
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
peculiarity
of
the
child
's
deportment
remains
yet
to
be
*NL*
told
.
The
very
first
thing
which
she
had
noticed
in
her
life
,
*NL*
was
--
what
?
--
not
the
mother
's
smile
,
responding
to
it
,
as
other
*NL*
babies
do
,
by
that
faint
,
embryo
smile
of
the
little
mouth
,
*NL*
remembered
so
doubtfully
afterwards
,
and
with
such
fond
*NL*
discussion
whether
it
were
indeed
a
smile
.
By
no
means
!
But
that
*NL*
first
object
of
which
Pearl
seemed
to
become
aware
was
--
shall
we
*NL*
say
it
?
--
the
scarlet
letter
on
Hester
's
bosom
!
One
day
,
as
her
*NL*
mother
stooped
over
the
cradle
,
the
infant
's
eyes
had
been
*NL*
caught
by
the
glimmering
of
the
gold
embroidery
about
the
*NL*
letter
;
and
putting
up
her
little
hand
she
grasped
at
it
,
*NL*
smiling
,
not
doubtfully
,
but
with
a
decided
gleam
,
that
gave
her
*NL*
face
the
look
of
a
much
older
child
.
Then
,
gasping
for
breath
,
*NL*
did
Hester
Prynne
clutch
the
fatal
token
,
instinctively
*NL*
endeavouring
to
tear
it
away
,
so
infinite
was
the
torture
*NL*
inflicted
by
the
intelligent
touch
of
Pearl
's
baby-hand
.
Again
,
*NL*
as
if
her
mother
's
agonised
gesture
were
meant
only
to
make
*NL*
sport
for
her
,
did
little
Pearl
look
into
her
eyes
,
and
smile
.
*NL*
From
that
epoch
,
except
when
the
child
was
asleep
,
Hester
had
*NL*
never
felt
a
moment
's
safety
:
not
a
moment
's
calm
enjoyment
of
*NL*
her
.
Weeks
,
it
is
true
,
would
sometimes
elapse
,
during
which
*NL*
Pearl
's
gaze
might
never
once
be
fixed
upon
the
scarlet
letter
;
*NL*
but
then
,
again
,
it
would
come
at
unawares
,
like
the
stroke
of
*NL*
sudden
death
,
and
always
with
that
peculiar
smile
and
odd
*NL*
expression
of
the
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
this
freakish
,
elvish
cast
came
into
the
child
's
eyes
while
*NL*
Hester
was
looking
at
her
own
image
in
them
,
as
mothers
are
fond
*NL*
of
doing
;
and
suddenly
for
women
in
solitude
,
and
with
troubled
*NL*
hearts
,
are
pestered
with
unaccountable
delusions
she
fancied
*NL*
that
she
beheld
,
not
her
own
miniature
portrait
,
but
another
*NL*
face
in
the
small
black
mirror
of
Pearl
's
eye
.
It
was
a
face
,
*NL*
fiend-like
,
full
of
smiling
malice
,
yet
bearing
the
semblance
of
*NL*
features
that
she
had
known
full
well
,
though
seldom
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
and
never
with
malice
in
them
.
It
was
as
if
an
evil
*NL*
spirit
possessed
the
child
,
and
had
just
then
peeped
forth
in
*NL*
mockery
.
Many
a
time
afterwards
had
Hester
been
tortured
,
though
*NL*
less
vividly
,
by
the
same
illusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
of
a
certain
summer
's
day
,
after
Pearl
grew
big
*NL*
enough
to
run
about
,
she
amused
herself
with
gathering
handfuls
*NL*
of
wild
flowers
,
and
flinging
them
,
one
by
one
,
at
her
mother
's
*NL*
bosom
;
dancing
up
and
down
like
a
little
elf
whenever
she
hit
*NL*
the
scarlet
letter
.
Hester
's
first
motion
had
been
to
cover
her
*NL*
bosom
with
her
clasped
hands
.
But
whether
from
pride
or
*NL*
resignation
,
or
a
feeling
that
her
penance
might
best
be
wrought
*NL*
out
by
this
unutterable
pain
,
she
resisted
the
impulse
,
and
sat
*NL*
erect
,
pale
as
death
,
looking
sadly
into
little
Pearl
's
wild
*NL*
eyes
.
Still
came
the
battery
of
flowers
,
almost
invariably
*NL*
hitting
the
mark
,
and
covering
the
mother
's
breast
with
hurts
*NL*
for
which
she
could
find
no
balm
in
this
world
,
nor
knew
how
to
*NL*
seek
it
in
another
.
At
last
,
her
shot
being
all
expended
,
the
*NL*
child
stood
still
and
gazed
at
Hester
,
with
that
little
laughing
*NL*
image
of
a
fiend
peeping
out
--
or
,
whether
it
peeped
or
no
,
her
*NL*
mother
so
imagined
it
--
from
the
unsearchable
abyss
of
her
black
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
,
what
art
thou
?
''
cried
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
your
little
Pearl
!
''
answered
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
she
said
it
,
Pearl
laughed
,
and
began
to
dance
up
and
*NL*
down
with
the
humoursome
gesticulation
of
a
little
imp
,
whose
*NL*
next
freak
might
be
to
fly
up
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Art
thou
my
child
,
in
very
truth
?
''
asked
Hester
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
she
put
the
question
altogether
idly
,
but
,
for
the
*NL*
moment
,
with
a
portion
of
genuine
earnestness
;
for
,
such
was
*NL*
Pearl
's
wonderful
intelligence
,
that
her
mother
half
doubted
*NL*
whether
she
were
not
acquainted
with
the
secret
spell
of
her
*NL*
existence
,
and
might
not
now
reveal
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
am
little
Pearl
!
''
repeated
the
child
,
continuing
her
*NL*
antics
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
not
my
child
!
Thou
art
no
Pearl
of
mine
!
''
said
the
*NL*
mother
half
playfully
;
for
it
was
often
the
case
that
a
sportive
*NL*
impulse
came
over
her
in
the
midst
of
her
deepest
suffering
.
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
then
,
what
thou
art
,
and
who
sent
thee
hither
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
mother
!
''
said
the
child
,
seriously
,
coming
up
to
*NL*
Hester
,
and
pressing
herself
close
to
her
knees
.
``
Do
thou
tell
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy
Heavenly
Father
sent
thee
!
''
answered
Hester
Prynne
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
said
it
with
a
hesitation
that
did
not
escape
the
*NL*
acuteness
of
the
child
.
Whether
moved
only
by
her
ordinary
*NL*
freakishness
,
or
because
an
evil
spirit
prompted
her
,
she
put
up
*NL*
her
small
forefinger
and
touched
the
scarlet
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
send
me
!
''
cried
she
,
positively
.
``
I
have
no
*NL*
Heavenly
Father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
Pearl
,
hush
!
Thou
must
not
talk
so
!
''
answered
the
*NL*
mother
,
suppressing
a
groan
.
``
He
sent
us
all
into
the
world
.
He
*NL*
sent
even
me
,
thy
mother
.
Then
,
much
more
thee
!
Or
,
if
not
,
thou
*NL*
strange
and
elfish
child
,
whence
didst
thou
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
!
Tell
me
!
''
repeated
Pearl
,
no
longer
seriously
,
but
*NL*
laughing
and
capering
about
the
floor
.
``
It
is
thou
that
must
*NL*
tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Hester
could
not
resolve
the
query
,
being
herself
in
a
*NL*
dismal
labyrinth
of
doubt
.
She
remembered
--
betwixt
a
smile
and
a
*NL*
shudder
--
the
talk
of
the
neighbouring
townspeople
,
who
,
seeking
*NL*
vainly
elsewhere
for
the
child
's
paternity
,
and
observing
some
*NL*
of
her
odd
attributes
,
had
given
out
that
poor
little
Pearl
was
*NL*
a
demon
offspring
:
such
as
,
ever
since
old
Catholic
times
,
had
*NL*
occasionally
been
seen
on
earth
,
through
the
agency
of
their
*NL*
mother
's
sin
,
and
to
promote
some
foul
and
wicked
purpose
.
*NL*
Luther
,
according
to
the
scandal
of
his
monkish
enemies
,
was
a
*NL*
brat
of
that
hellish
breed
;
nor
was
Pearl
the
only
child
to
whom
*NL*
this
inauspicious
origin
was
assigned
among
the
New
England
*NL*
Puritans
.

THE
GOVERNOR
'S
HALL
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
went
one
day
to
the
mansion
of
Governor
*NL*
Bellingham
,
with
a
pair
of
gloves
which
she
had
fringed
and
*NL*
embroidered
to
his
order
,
and
which
were
to
be
worn
on
some
*NL*
great
occasion
of
state
;
for
,
though
the
chances
of
a
popular
*NL*
election
had
caused
this
former
ruler
to
descend
a
step
or
two
*NL*
from
the
highest
rank
,
he
still
held
an
honourable
and
*NL*
influential
place
among
the
colonial
magistracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
and
far
more
important
reason
than
the
delivery
of
a
*NL*
pair
of
embroidered
gloves
,
impelled
Hester
,
at
this
time
,
to
*NL*
seek
an
interview
with
a
personage
of
so
much
power
and
activity
*NL*
in
the
affairs
of
the
settlement
.
It
had
reached
her
ears
that
*NL*
there
was
a
design
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
leading
*NL*
inhabitants
,
cherishing
the
more
rigid
order
of
principles
in
*NL*
religion
and
government
,
to
deprive
her
of
her
child
.
On
the
*NL*
supposition
that
Pearl
,
as
already
hinted
,
was
of
demon
origin
,
*NL*
these
good
people
not
unreasonably
argued
that
a
Christian
*NL*
interest
in
the
mother
's
soul
required
them
to
remove
such
a
*NL*
stumbling-block
from
her
path
.
If
the
child
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
were
really
capable
of
moral
and
religious
growth
,
and
possessed
*NL*
the
elements
of
ultimate
salvation
,
then
,
surely
,
it
would
enjoy
*NL*
all
the
fairer
prospect
of
these
advantages
by
being
transferred
*NL*
to
wiser
and
better
guardianship
than
Hester
Prynne
's
.
Among
*NL*
those
who
promoted
the
design
,
Governor
Bellingham
was
said
to
*NL*
be
one
of
the
most
busy
.
It
may
appear
singular
,
and
,
indeed
,
*NL*
not
a
little
ludicrous
,
that
an
affair
of
this
kind
,
which
in
*NL*
later
days
would
have
been
referred
to
no
higher
jurisdiction
*NL*
than
that
of
the
select
men
of
the
town
,
should
then
have
been
a
*NL*
question
publicly
discussed
,
and
on
which
statesmen
of
eminence
*NL*
took
sides
.
At
that
epoch
of
pristine
simplicity
,
however
,
*NL*
matters
of
even
slighter
public
interest
,
and
of
far
less
*NL*
intrinsic
weight
than
the
welfare
of
Hester
and
her
child
,
were
*NL*
strangely
mixed
up
with
the
deliberations
of
legislators
and
*NL*
acts
of
state
.
The
period
was
hardly
,
if
at
all
,
earlier
than
*NL*
that
of
our
story
,
when
a
dispute
concerning
the
right
of
*NL*
property
in
a
pig
not
only
caused
a
fierce
and
bitter
contest
in
*NL*
the
legislative
body
of
the
colony
,
but
resulted
in
an
important
*NL*
modification
of
the
framework
itself
of
the
legislature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Full
of
concern
,
therefore
--
but
so
conscious
of
her
own
right
*NL*
that
it
seemed
scarcely
an
unequal
match
between
the
public
on
*NL*
the
one
side
,
and
a
lonely
woman
,
backed
by
the
sympathies
of
*NL*
nature
,
on
the
other
--
Hester
Prynne
set
forth
from
her
solitary
*NL*
cottage
.
Little
Pearl
,
of
course
,
was
her
companion
.
She
was
now
*NL*
of
an
age
to
run
lightly
along
by
her
mother
's
side
,
and
,
*NL*
constantly
in
motion
from
morn
till
sunset
,
could
have
*NL*
accomplished
a
much
longer
journey
than
that
before
her
.
Often
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
more
from
caprice
than
necessity
,
she
demanded
to
*NL*
be
taken
up
in
arms
;
but
was
soon
as
imperious
to
be
let
down
*NL*
again
,
and
frisked
onward
before
Hester
on
the
grassy
pathway
,
*NL*
with
many
a
harmless
trip
and
tumble
.
We
have
spoken
of
Pearl
's
*NL*
rich
and
luxuriant
beauty
--
a
beauty
that
shone
with
deep
and
*NL*
vivid
tints
,
a
bright
complexion
,
eyes
possessing
intensity
both
*NL*
of
depth
and
glow
,
and
hair
already
of
a
deep
,
glossy
brown
,
and
*NL*
which
,
in
after
years
,
would
be
nearly
akin
to
black
.
There
was
*NL*
fire
in
her
and
throughout
her
:
she
seemed
the
unpremeditated
*NL*
offshoot
of
a
passionate
moment
.
Her
mother
,
in
contriving
the
*NL*
child
's
garb
,
had
allowed
the
gorgeous
tendencies
of
her
*NL*
imagination
their
full
play
,
arraying
her
in
a
crimson
velvet
*NL*
tunic
of
a
peculiar
cut
,
abundantly
embroidered
in
fantasies
and
*NL*
flourishes
of
gold
thread
.
So
much
strength
of
colouring
,
which
*NL*
must
have
given
a
wan
and
pallid
aspect
to
cheeks
of
a
fainter
*NL*
bloom
,
was
admirably
adapted
to
Pearl
's
beauty
,
and
made
her
the
*NL*
very
brightest
little
jet
of
flame
that
ever
danced
upon
the
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
a
remarkable
attribute
of
this
garb
,
and
indeed
,
of
*NL*
the
child
's
whole
appearance
,
that
it
irresistibly
and
*NL*
inevitably
reminded
the
beholder
of
the
token
which
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
was
doomed
to
wear
upon
her
bosom
.
It
was
the
scarlet
*NL*
letter
in
another
form
:
the
scarlet
letter
endowed
with
life
!
*NL*
The
mother
herself
--
as
if
the
red
ignominy
were
so
deeply
*NL*
scorched
into
her
brain
that
all
her
conceptions
assumed
its
*NL*
form
--
had
carefully
wrought
out
the
similitude
,
lavishing
many
*NL*
hours
of
morbid
ingenuity
to
create
an
analogy
between
the
*NL*
object
of
her
affection
and
the
emblem
of
her
guilt
and
torture
.
*NL*
But
,
in
truth
,
Pearl
was
the
one
as
well
as
the
other
;
and
only
*NL*
in
consequence
of
that
identity
had
Hester
contrived
so
*NL*
perfectly
to
represent
the
scarlet
letter
in
her
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
two
wayfarers
came
within
the
precincts
of
the
town
,
the
*NL*
children
of
the
Puritans
looked
up
from
their
play
,
--
or
what
*NL*
passed
for
play
with
those
sombre
little
urchins
--
and
spoke
*NL*
gravely
one
to
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behold
,
verily
,
there
is
the
woman
of
the
scarlet
letter
:
and
*NL*
of
a
truth
,
moreover
,
there
is
the
likeness
of
the
scarlet
*NL*
letter
running
along
by
her
side
!
Come
,
therefore
,
and
let
us
*NL*
fling
mud
at
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Pearl
,
who
was
a
dauntless
child
,
after
frowning
,
stamping
*NL*
her
foot
,
and
shaking
her
little
hand
with
a
variety
of
*NL*
threatening
gestures
,
suddenly
made
a
rush
at
the
knot
of
her
*NL*
enemies
,
and
put
them
all
to
flight
.
She
resembled
,
in
her
*NL*
fierce
pursuit
of
them
,
an
infant
pestilence
--
the
scarlet
fever
,
*NL*
or
some
such
half-fledged
angel
of
judgment
--
whose
mission
was
*NL*
to
punish
the
sins
of
the
rising
generation
.
She
screamed
and
*NL*
shouted
,
too
,
with
a
terrific
volume
of
sound
,
which
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
caused
the
hearts
of
the
fugitives
to
quake
within
them
.
The
*NL*
victory
accomplished
,
Pearl
returned
quietly
to
her
mother
,
and
*NL*
looked
up
,
smiling
,
into
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
further
adventure
,
they
reached
the
dwelling
of
Governor
*NL*
Bellingham
.
This
was
a
large
wooden
house
,
built
in
a
fashion
of
*NL*
which
there
are
specimens
still
extant
in
the
streets
of
our
*NL*
older
towns
now
moss-grown
,
crumbling
to
decay
,
and
melancholy
*NL*
at
heart
with
the
many
sorrowful
or
joyful
occurrences
,
*NL*
remembered
or
forgotten
,
that
have
happened
and
passed
away
*NL*
within
their
dusky
chambers
.
Then
,
however
,
there
was
the
*NL*
freshness
of
the
passing
year
on
its
exterior
,
and
the
*NL*
cheerfulness
,
gleaming
forth
from
the
sunny
windows
,
of
a
human
*NL*
habitation
,
into
which
death
had
never
entered
.
It
had
,
indeed
,
*NL*
a
very
cheery
aspect
,
the
walls
being
overspread
with
a
kind
of
*NL*
stucco
,
in
which
fragments
of
broken
glass
were
plentifully
*NL*
intermixed
;
so
that
,
when
the
sunshine
fell
aslant-wise
over
the
*NL*
front
of
the
edifice
,
it
glittered
and
sparkled
as
if
diamonds
*NL*
had
been
flung
against
it
by
the
double
handful
.
The
brilliancy
*NL*
might
have
be
fitted
Aladdin
's
palace
rather
than
the
mansion
of
*NL*
a
grave
old
Puritan
ruler
.
It
was
further
decorated
with
strange
*NL*
and
seemingly
cabalistic
figures
and
diagrams
,
suitable
to
the
*NL*
quaint
taste
of
the
age
which
had
been
drawn
in
the
stucco
,
when
*NL*
newly
laid
on
,
and
had
now
grown
hard
and
durable
,
for
the
*NL*
admiration
of
after
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
,
looking
at
this
bright
wonder
of
a
house
began
to
caper
*NL*
and
dance
,
and
imperatively
required
that
the
whole
breadth
of
*NL*
sunshine
should
be
stripped
off
its
front
,
and
given
her
to
play
*NL*
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
little
Pearl
!
''
said
her
mother
;
``
thou
must
gather
thine
*NL*
own
sunshine
.
I
have
none
to
give
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
approached
the
door
,
which
was
of
an
arched
form
,
and
*NL*
flanked
on
each
side
by
a
narrow
tower
or
projection
of
the
*NL*
edifice
,
in
both
of
which
were
lattice-windows
,
the
wooden
*NL*
shutters
to
close
over
them
at
need
.
Lifting
the
iron
hammer
*NL*
that
hung
at
the
portal
,
Hester
Prynne
gave
a
summons
,
which
was
*NL*
answered
by
one
of
the
Governor
's
bond
servant
--
a
free-born
*NL*
Englishman
,
but
now
a
seven
years
'
slave
.
During
that
term
he
*NL*
was
to
be
the
property
of
his
master
,
and
as
much
a
commodity
of
*NL*
bargain
and
sale
as
an
ox
,
or
a
joint-stool
.
The
serf
wore
the
*NL*
customary
garb
of
serving-men
at
that
period
,
and
long
before
,
*NL*
in
the
old
hereditary
halls
of
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
worshipful
Governor
Bellingham
within
?
''
inquired
Hester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yea
,
forsooth
,
''
replied
the
bond-servant
,
staring
with
*NL*
wide-open
eyes
at
the
scarlet
letter
,
which
,
being
a
new-comer
*NL*
in
the
country
,
he
had
never
before
seen
.
``
Yea
,
his
honourable
*NL*
worship
is
within
.
But
he
hath
a
godly
minister
or
two
with
him
,
*NL*
and
likewise
a
leech
.
Ye
may
not
see
his
worship
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
I
will
enter
,
''
answered
Hester
Prynne
;
and
the
*NL*
bond-servant
,
perhaps
judging
from
the
decision
of
her
air
,
and
*NL*
the
glittering
symbol
in
her
bosom
,
that
she
was
a
great
lady
in
*NL*
the
land
,
offered
no
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
mother
and
little
Pearl
were
admitted
into
the
hall
of
*NL*
entrance
.
With
many
variations
,
suggested
by
the
nature
of
his
*NL*
building
materials
,
diversity
of
climate
,
and
a
different
mode
*NL*
of
social
life
,
Governor
Bellingham
had
planned
his
new
*NL*
habitation
after
the
residences
of
gentlemen
of
fair
estate
in
*NL*
his
native
land
.
Here
,
then
,
was
a
wide
and
reasonably
lofty
*NL*
hall
,
extending
through
the
whole
depth
of
the
house
,
and
*NL*
forming
a
medium
of
general
communication
,
more
or
less
*NL*
directly
,
with
all
the
other
apartments
.
At
one
extremity
,
this
*NL*
spacious
room
was
lighted
by
the
windows
of
the
two
towers
,
*NL*
which
formed
a
small
recess
on
either
side
of
the
portal
.
At
the
*NL*
other
end
,
though
partly
muffled
by
a
curtain
,
it
was
more
*NL*
powerfully
illuminated
by
one
of
those
embowed
hall
windows
*NL*
which
we
read
of
in
old
books
,
and
which
was
provided
with
a
*NL*
deep
and
cushioned
seat
.
Here
,
on
the
cushion
,
lay
a
folio
tome
,
*NL*
probably
of
the
Chronicles
of
England
,
or
other
such
substantial
*NL*
literature
;
even
as
,
in
our
own
days
,
we
scatter
gilded
volumes
*NL*
on
the
centre
table
,
to
be
turned
over
by
the
casual
guest
.
The
*NL*
furniture
of
the
hall
consisted
of
some
ponderous
chairs
,
the
*NL*
backs
of
which
were
elaborately
carved
with
wreaths
of
oaken
*NL*
flowers
;
and
likewise
a
table
in
the
same
taste
,
the
whole
being
*NL*
of
the
Elizabethan
age
,
or
perhaps
earlier
,
and
heirlooms
,
*NL*
transferred
hither
from
the
Governor
's
paternal
home
.
On
the
*NL*
table
--
in
token
that
the
sentiment
of
old
English
hospitality
*NL*
had
not
been
left
behind
--
stood
a
large
pewter
tankard
,
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
which
,
had
Hester
or
Pearl
peeped
into
it
,
they
might
*NL*
have
seen
the
frothy
remnant
of
a
recent
draught
of
ale
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
wall
hung
a
row
of
portraits
,
representing
the
*NL*
forefathers
of
the
Bellingham
lineage
,
some
with
armour
on
their
*NL*
breasts
,
and
others
with
stately
ruffs
and
robes
of
peace
.
All
*NL*
were
characterised
by
the
sternness
and
severity
which
old
*NL*
portraits
so
invariably
put
on
,
as
if
they
were
the
ghosts
,
*NL*
rather
than
the
pictures
,
of
departed
worthies
,
and
were
gazing
*NL*
with
harsh
and
intolerant
criticism
at
the
pursuits
and
*NL*
enjoyments
of
living
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
the
centre
of
the
oaken
panels
that
lined
the
hall
was
*NL*
suspended
a
suit
of
mail
,
not
,
like
the
pictures
,
an
ancestral
*NL*
relic
,
but
of
the
most
modern
date
;
for
it
had
been
manufactured
*NL*
by
a
skilful
armourer
in
London
,
the
same
year
in
which
Governor
*NL*
Bellingham
came
over
to
New
England
.
There
was
a
steel
*NL*
head-piece
,
a
cuirass
,
a
gorget
and
greaves
,
with
a
pair
of
*NL*
gauntlets
and
a
sword
hanging
beneath
;
all
,
and
especially
the
*NL*
helmet
and
breastplate
,
so
highly
burnished
as
to
glow
with
*NL*
white
radiance
,
and
scatter
an
illumination
everywhere
about
*NL*
upon
the
floor
.
This
bright
panoply
was
not
meant
for
mere
idle
*NL*
show
,
but
had
been
worn
by
the
Governor
on
many
a
solemn
muster
*NL*
and
training
field
,
and
had
glittered
,
moreover
,
at
the
head
of
*NL*
a
regiment
in
the
Pequod
war
.
For
,
though
bred
a
lawyer
,
and
*NL*
accustomed
to
speak
of
Bacon
,
Coke
,
Noye
,
and
Finch
,
as
his
*NL*
professional
associates
,
the
exigencies
of
this
new
country
had
*NL*
transformed
Governor
Bellingham
into
a
soldier
,
as
well
as
a
*NL*
statesman
and
ruler
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Pearl
,
who
was
as
greatly
pleased
with
the
gleaming
*NL*
armour
as
she
had
been
with
the
glittering
frontispiece
of
the
*NL*
house
,
spent
some
time
looking
into
the
polished
mirror
of
the
*NL*
breastplate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
cried
she
,
``
I
see
you
here
.
Look
!
Look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
looked
by
way
of
humouring
the
child
;
and
she
saw
that
,
*NL*
owing
to
the
peculiar
effect
of
this
convex
mirror
,
the
scarlet
*NL*
letter
was
represented
in
exaggerated
and
gigantic
proportions
,
*NL*
so
as
to
be
greatly
the
most
prominent
feature
of
her
*NL*
appearance
.
In
truth
,
she
seemed
absolutely
hidden
behind
it
.
*NL*
Pearl
pointed
upwards
also
,
at
a
similar
picture
in
the
*NL*
head-piece
;
smiling
at
her
mother
,
with
the
elfish
intelligence
*NL*
that
was
so
familiar
an
expression
on
her
small
physiognomy
.
*NL*
That
look
of
naughty
merriment
was
likewise
reflected
in
the
*NL*
mirror
,
with
so
much
breadth
and
intensity
of
effect
,
that
it
*NL*
made
Hester
Prynne
feel
as
if
it
could
not
be
the
image
of
her
*NL*
own
child
,
but
of
an
imp
who
was
seeking
to
mould
itself
into
*NL*
Pearl
's
shape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
Pearl
,
''
said
she
,
drawing
her
away
,
``
Come
and
look
*NL*
into
this
fair
garden
.
It
may
be
we
shall
see
flowers
there
;
*NL*
more
beautiful
ones
than
we
find
in
the
woods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
accordingly
ran
to
the
bow-window
,
at
the
further
end
of
*NL*
the
hall
,
and
looked
along
the
vista
of
a
garden
walk
,
carpeted
*NL*
with
closely-shaven
grass
,
and
bordered
with
some
rude
and
*NL*
immature
attempt
at
shrubbery
.
But
the
proprietor
appeared
*NL*
already
to
have
relinquished
as
hopeless
,
the
effort
to
*NL*
perpetuate
on
this
side
of
the
Atlantic
,
in
a
hard
soil
,
and
*NL*
amid
the
close
struggle
for
subsistence
,
the
native
English
*NL*
taste
for
ornamental
gardening
.
Cabbages
grew
in
plain
sight
;
*NL*
and
a
pumpkin-vine
,
rooted
at
some
distance
,
had
run
across
the
*NL*
intervening
space
,
and
deposited
one
of
its
gigantic
products
*NL*
directly
beneath
the
hall
window
,
as
if
to
warn
the
Governor
*NL*
that
this
great
lump
of
vegetable
gold
was
as
rich
an
ornament
*NL*
as
New
England
earth
would
offer
him
.
There
were
a
few
*NL*
rose-bushes
,
however
,
and
a
number
of
apple-trees
,
probably
the
*NL*
descendants
of
those
planted
by
the
Reverend
Mr.
Blackstone
,
the
*NL*
first
settler
of
the
peninsula
;
that
half
mythological
personage
*NL*
who
rides
through
our
early
annals
,
seated
on
the
back
of
a
*NL*
bull
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
,
seeing
the
rose-bushes
,
began
to
cry
for
a
red
rose
,
and
*NL*
would
not
be
pacified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
child
--
hush
!
''
said
her
mother
,
earnestly
.
``
Do
not
cry
,
*NL*
dear
little
Pearl
!
I
hear
voices
in
the
garden
.
The
Governor
is
*NL*
coming
,
and
gentlemen
along
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
adown
the
vista
of
the
garden
avenue
,
a
number
of
*NL*
persons
were
seen
approaching
towards
the
house
.
Pearl
,
in
utter
*NL*
scorn
of
her
mother
's
attempt
to
quiet
her
,
gave
an
eldritch
*NL*
scream
,
and
then
became
silent
,
not
from
any
notion
of
*NL*
obedience
,
but
because
the
quick
and
mobile
curiosity
of
her
*NL*
disposition
was
excited
by
the
appearance
of
those
new
*NL*
personages
.
*NL*

VIII
.
THE
ELF-CHILD
AND
THE
MINISTER
*NL*
*NL*
Governor
Bellingham
,
in
a
loose
gown
and
easy
cap
--
such
as
*NL*
elderly
gentlemen
loved
to
endue
themselves
with
,
in
their
*NL*
domestic
privacy
--
walked
foremost
,
and
appeared
to
be
showing
*NL*
off
his
estate
,
and
expatiating
on
his
projected
improvements
.
*NL*
The
wide
circumference
of
an
elaborate
ruff
,
beneath
his
grey
*NL*
beard
,
in
the
antiquated
fashion
of
King
James
's
reign
,
caused
*NL*
his
head
to
look
not
a
little
like
that
of
John
the
Baptist
in
a
*NL*
charger
.
The
impression
made
by
his
aspect
,
so
rigid
and
severe
,
*NL*
and
frost-bitten
with
more
than
autumnal
age
,
was
hardly
in
*NL*
keeping
with
the
appliances
of
worldly
enjoyment
wherewith
he
*NL*
had
evidently
done
his
utmost
to
surround
himself
.
But
it
is
an
*NL*
error
to
suppose
that
our
great
forefathers
--
though
accustomed
*NL*
to
speak
and
think
of
human
existence
as
a
state
merely
of
trial
*NL*
and
warfare
,
and
though
unfeignedly
prepared
to
sacrifice
goods
*NL*
and
life
at
the
behest
of
duty
--
made
it
a
matter
of
conscience
*NL*
to
reject
such
means
of
comfort
,
or
even
luxury
,
as
lay
fairly
*NL*
within
their
grasp
.
This
creed
was
never
taught
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
by
the
venerable
pastor
,
John
Wilson
,
whose
beard
,
white
as
a
*NL*
snow-drift
,
was
seen
over
Governor
Bellingham
's
shoulders
,
while
*NL*
its
wearer
suggested
that
pears
and
peaches
might
yet
be
*NL*
naturalised
in
the
New
England
climate
,
and
that
purple
grapes
*NL*
might
possibly
be
compelled
to
flourish
against
the
sunny
*NL*
garden-wall
.
The
old
clergyman
,
nurtured
at
the
rich
bosom
of
*NL*
the
English
Church
,
had
a
long
established
and
legitimate
taste
*NL*
for
all
good
and
comfortable
things
,
and
however
stern
he
might
*NL*
show
himself
in
the
pulpit
,
or
in
his
public
reproof
of
such
*NL*
transgressions
as
that
of
Hester
Prynne
,
still
,
the
genial
*NL*
benevolence
of
his
private
life
had
won
him
warmer
affection
*NL*
than
was
accorded
to
any
of
his
professional
contemporaries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
the
Governor
and
Mr.
Wilson
came
two
other
guests
--
one
,
*NL*
the
Reverend
Arthur
Dimmesdale
,
whom
the
reader
may
remember
as
*NL*
having
taken
a
brief
and
reluctant
part
in
the
scene
of
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
's
disgrace
;
and
,
in
close
companionship
with
him
,
old
*NL*
Roger
Chillingworth
,
a
person
of
great
skill
in
physic
,
who
for
*NL*
two
or
three
years
past
had
been
settled
in
the
town
.
It
was
*NL*
understood
that
this
learned
man
was
the
physician
as
well
as
*NL*
friend
of
the
young
minister
,
whose
health
had
severely
suffered
*NL*
of
late
by
his
too
unreserved
self-sacrifice
to
the
labours
and
*NL*
duties
of
the
pastoral
relation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Governor
,
in
advance
of
his
visitors
,
ascended
one
or
two
*NL*
steps
,
and
,
throwing
open
the
leaves
of
the
great
hall
window
,
*NL*
found
himself
close
to
little
Pearl
.
The
shadow
of
the
curtain
*NL*
fell
on
Hester
Prynne
,
and
partially
concealed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
we
here
?
''
said
Governor
Bellingham
,
looking
with
*NL*
surprise
at
the
scarlet
little
figure
before
him
.
``
I
profess
,
I
*NL*
have
never
seen
the
like
since
my
days
of
vanity
,
in
old
King
*NL*
James
's
time
,
when
I
was
wont
to
esteem
it
a
high
favour
to
be
*NL*
admitted
to
a
court
mask
!
There
used
to
be
a
swarm
of
these
*NL*
small
apparitions
in
holiday
time
,
and
we
called
them
children
*NL*
of
the
Lord
of
Misrule
.
But
how
gat
such
a
guest
into
my
hall
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
indeed
!
''
cried
good
old
Mr.
Wilson
.
``
What
little
bird
of
*NL*
scarlet
plumage
may
this
be
?
Methinks
I
have
seen
just
such
*NL*
figures
when
the
sun
has
been
shining
through
a
richly
painted
*NL*
window
,
and
tracing
out
the
golden
and
crimson
images
across
the
*NL*
floor
.
But
that
was
in
the
old
land
.
Prithee
,
young
one
,
who
art
*NL*
thou
,
and
what
has
ailed
thy
mother
to
bedizen
thee
in
this
*NL*
strange
fashion
?
Art
thou
a
Christian
child
--
ha
?
Dost
know
thy
*NL*
catechism
?
Or
art
thou
one
of
those
naughty
elfs
or
fairies
whom
*NL*
we
thought
to
have
left
behind
us
,
with
other
relics
of
*NL*
Papistry
,
in
merry
old
England
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
mother
's
child
,
''
answered
the
scarlet
vision
,
``
and
my
name
*NL*
is
Pearl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pearl
?
--
Ruby
,
rather
--
or
Coral
!
--
or
Red
Rose
,
at
the
very
*NL*
least
,
judging
from
thy
hue
!
''
responded
the
old
minister
,
*NL*
putting
forth
his
hand
in
a
vain
attempt
to
pat
little
Pearl
on
*NL*
the
cheek
.
``
But
where
is
this
mother
of
thine
?
Ah
!
I
see
,
''
he
*NL*
added
;
and
,
turning
to
Governor
Bellingham
,
whispered
,
``
This
is
*NL*
the
selfsame
child
of
whom
we
have
held
speech
together
;
and
*NL*
behold
here
the
unhappy
woman
,
Hester
Prynne
,
her
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sayest
thou
so
?
''
cried
the
Governor
.
``
Nay
,
we
might
have
*NL*
judged
that
such
a
child
's
mother
must
needs
be
a
scarlet
woman
,
*NL*
and
a
worthy
type
of
her
of
Babylon
!
But
she
comes
at
a
good
*NL*
time
,
and
we
will
look
into
this
matter
forthwith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Governor
Bellingham
stepped
through
the
window
into
the
hall
,
*NL*
followed
by
his
three
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hester
Prynne
,
''
said
he
,
fixing
his
naturally
stern
regard
on
*NL*
the
wearer
of
the
scarlet
letter
,
``
there
hath
been
much
question
*NL*
concerning
thee
of
late
.
The
point
hath
been
weightily
*NL*
discussed
,
whether
we
,
that
are
of
authority
and
influence
,
do
*NL*
well
discharge
our
consciences
by
trusting
an
immortal
soul
,
*NL*
such
as
there
is
in
yonder
child
,
to
the
guidance
of
one
who
*NL*
hath
stumbled
and
fallen
amid
the
pitfalls
of
this
world
.
Speak
*NL*
thou
,
the
child
's
own
mother
!
Were
it
not
,
thinkest
thou
,
for
*NL*
thy
little
one
's
temporal
and
eternal
welfare
that
she
be
taken
*NL*
out
of
thy
charge
,
and
clad
soberly
,
and
disciplined
strictly
,
*NL*
and
instructed
in
the
truths
of
heaven
and
earth
?
What
canst
*NL*
thou
do
for
the
child
in
this
kind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
teach
my
little
Pearl
what
I
have
learned
from
this
!
''
*NL*
answered
Hester
Prynne
,
laying
her
finger
on
the
red
token
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woman
,
it
is
thy
badge
of
shame
!
''
replied
the
stern
magistrate
.
*NL*
``
It
is
because
of
the
stain
which
that
letter
indicates
that
we
*NL*
would
transfer
thy
child
to
other
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
''
said
the
mother
,
calmly
,
though
growing
more
*NL*
pale
,
``
this
badge
hath
taught
me
--
it
daily
teaches
me
--
it
is
*NL*
teaching
me
at
this
moment
--
lessons
whereof
my
child
may
be
the
*NL*
wiser
and
better
,
albeit
they
can
profit
nothing
to
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
judge
warily
,
''
said
Bellingham
,
``
and
look
well
what
we
*NL*
are
about
to
do
.
Good
Master
Wilson
,
I
pray
you
,
examine
this
*NL*
Pearl
--
since
that
is
her
name
--
and
see
whether
she
hath
had
such
*NL*
Christian
nurture
as
befits
a
child
of
her
age
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
minister
seated
himself
in
an
arm-chair
and
made
an
*NL*
effort
to
draw
Pearl
betwixt
his
knees
.
But
the
child
,
*NL*
unaccustomed
to
the
touch
or
familiarity
of
any
but
her
mother
,
*NL*
escaped
through
the
open
window
,
and
stood
on
the
upper
step
,
*NL*
looking
like
a
wild
tropical
bird
of
rich
plumage
,
ready
to
take
*NL*
flight
into
the
upper
air
.
Mr.
Wilson
,
not
a
little
astonished
*NL*
at
this
outbreak
--
for
he
was
a
grandfatherly
sort
of
personage
,
*NL*
and
usually
a
vast
favourite
with
children
--
essayed
,
however
,
to
*NL*
proceed
with
the
examination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pearl
,
''
said
he
,
with
great
solemnity
,
``
thou
must
take
heed
to
*NL*
instruction
,
that
so
,
in
due
season
,
thou
mayest
wear
in
thy
*NL*
bosom
the
pearl
of
great
price
.
Canst
thou
tell
me
,
my
child
,
*NL*
who
made
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Pearl
knew
well
enough
who
made
her
,
for
Hester
Prynne
,
the
*NL*
daughter
of
a
pious
home
,
very
soon
after
her
talk
with
the
*NL*
child
about
her
Heavenly
Father
,
had
begun
to
inform
her
of
*NL*
those
truths
which
the
human
spirit
,
at
whatever
stage
of
*NL*
immaturity
,
imbibes
with
such
eager
interest
.
Pearl
,
*NL*
therefore
--
so
large
were
the
attainments
of
her
three
years
'
*NL*
lifetime
--
could
have
borne
a
fair
examination
in
the
New
England
*NL*
Primer
,
or
the
first
column
of
the
Westminster
Catechisms
,
*NL*
although
unacquainted
with
the
outward
form
of
either
of
those
*NL*
celebrated
works
.
But
that
perversity
,
which
all
children
have
*NL*
more
or
less
of
,
and
of
which
little
Pearl
had
a
tenfold
*NL*
portion
,
now
,
at
the
most
inopportune
moment
,
took
thorough
*NL*
possession
of
her
,
and
closed
her
lips
,
or
impelled
her
to
speak
*NL*
words
amiss
.
After
putting
her
finger
in
her
mouth
,
with
many
*NL*
ungracious
refusals
to
answer
good
Mr.
Wilson
's
question
,
the
*NL*
child
finally
announced
that
she
had
not
been
made
at
all
,
but
*NL*
had
been
plucked
by
her
mother
off
the
bush
of
wild
roses
that
*NL*
grew
by
the
prison-door
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
phantasy
was
probably
suggested
by
the
near
proximity
of
*NL*
the
Governor
's
red
roses
,
as
Pearl
stood
outside
of
the
window
,
*NL*
together
with
her
recollection
of
the
prison
rose-bush
,
which
*NL*
she
had
passed
in
coming
hither
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Roger
Chillingworth
,
with
a
smile
on
his
face
,
whispered
*NL*
something
in
the
young
clergyman
's
ear
.
Hester
Prynne
looked
at
*NL*
the
man
of
skill
,
and
even
then
,
with
her
fate
hanging
in
the
*NL*
balance
,
was
startled
to
perceive
what
a
change
had
come
over
*NL*
his
features
--
how
much
uglier
they
were
,
how
his
dark
complexion
*NL*
seemed
to
have
grown
duskier
,
and
his
figure
more
*NL*
misshapen
--
since
the
days
when
she
had
familiarly
known
him
.
She
*NL*
met
his
eyes
for
an
instant
,
but
was
immediately
constrained
to
*NL*
give
all
her
attention
to
the
scene
now
going
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
awful
!
''
cried
the
Governor
,
slowly
recovering
from
the
*NL*
astonishment
into
which
Pearl
's
response
had
thrown
him
.
``
Here
*NL*
is
a
child
of
three
years
old
,
and
she
can
not
tell
who
made
her
!
*NL*
Without
question
,
she
is
equally
in
the
dark
as
to
her
soul
,
its
*NL*
present
depravity
,
and
future
destiny
!
Methinks
,
gentlemen
,
we
*NL*
need
inquire
no
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
caught
hold
of
Pearl
,
and
drew
her
forcibly
into
her
*NL*
arms
,
confronting
the
old
Puritan
magistrate
with
almost
a
*NL*
fierce
expression
.
Alone
in
the
world
,
cast
off
by
it
,
and
with
*NL*
this
sole
treasure
to
keep
her
heart
alive
,
she
felt
that
she
*NL*
possessed
indefeasible
rights
against
the
world
,
and
was
ready
*NL*
to
defend
them
to
the
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
gave
me
the
child
!
''
cried
she
.
``
He
gave
her
in
requital
of
*NL*
all
things
else
which
ye
had
taken
from
me
.
She
is
my
*NL*
happiness
--
she
is
my
torture
,
none
the
less
!
Pearl
keeps
me
here
*NL*
in
life
!
Pearl
punishes
me
,
too
!
See
ye
not
,
she
is
the
scarlet
*NL*
letter
,
only
capable
of
being
loved
,
and
so
endowed
with
a
*NL*
millionfold
the
power
of
retribution
for
my
sin
?
Ye
shall
not
*NL*
take
her
!
I
will
die
first
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
woman
,
''
said
the
not
unkind
old
minister
,
``
the
child
*NL*
shall
be
well
cared
for
--
far
better
than
thou
canst
do
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
gave
her
into
my
keeping
!
''
repeated
Hester
Prynne
,
raising
*NL*
her
voice
almost
to
a
shriek
.
``
I
will
not
give
her
up
!
''
And
here
*NL*
by
a
sudden
impulse
,
she
turned
to
the
young
clergyman
,
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
,
at
whom
,
up
to
this
moment
,
she
had
seemed
hardly
so
*NL*
much
as
once
to
direct
her
eyes
.
``
Speak
thou
for
me
!
''
cried
she
.
*NL*
``
Thou
wast
my
pastor
,
and
hadst
charge
of
my
soul
,
and
knowest
*NL*
me
better
than
these
men
can
.
I
will
not
lose
the
child
!
Speak
*NL*
for
me
!
Thou
knowest
--
for
thou
hast
sympathies
which
these
men
*NL*
lack
--
thou
knowest
what
is
in
my
heart
,
and
what
are
a
mother
's
*NL*
rights
,
and
how
much
the
stronger
they
are
when
that
mother
has
*NL*
but
her
child
and
the
scarlet
letter
!
Look
thou
to
it
!
I
will
*NL*
not
lose
the
child
!
Look
to
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
wild
and
singular
appeal
,
which
indicated
that
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
's
situation
had
provoked
her
to
little
less
than
madness
,
*NL*
the
young
minister
at
once
came
forward
,
pale
,
and
holding
his
*NL*
hand
over
his
heart
,
as
was
his
custom
whenever
his
peculiarly
*NL*
nervous
temperament
was
thrown
into
agitation
.
He
looked
now
*NL*
more
careworn
and
emaciated
than
as
we
described
him
at
the
*NL*
scene
of
Hester
's
public
ignominy
;
and
whether
it
were
his
*NL*
failing
health
,
or
whatever
the
cause
might
be
,
his
large
dark
*NL*
eyes
had
a
world
of
pain
in
their
troubled
and
melancholy
depth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
truth
in
what
she
says
,
''
began
the
minister
,
with
a
*NL*
voice
sweet
,
tremulous
,
but
powerful
,
insomuch
that
the
hall
*NL*
re-echoed
and
the
hollow
armour
rang
with
it
--
``
truth
in
what
*NL*
Hester
says
,
and
in
the
feeling
which
inspires
her
!
God
gave
her
*NL*
the
child
,
and
gave
her
,
too
,
an
instinctive
knowledge
of
its
*NL*
nature
and
requirements
--
both
seemingly
so
peculiar
--
which
no
*NL*
other
mortal
being
can
possess
.
And
,
moreover
,
is
there
not
a
*NL*
quality
of
awful
sacredness
in
the
relation
between
this
mother
*NL*
and
this
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
--
how
is
that
,
good
Master
Dimmesdale
?
''
interrupted
the
*NL*
Governor
.
``
Make
that
plain
,
I
pray
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
even
so
,
''
resumed
the
minister
.
``
For
,
if
we
deem
it
*NL*
otherwise
,
do
we
not
thereby
say
that
the
Heavenly
Father
,
the
*NL*
creator
of
all
flesh
,
hath
lightly
recognised
a
deed
of
sin
,
and
*NL*
made
of
no
account
the
distinction
between
unhallowed
lust
and
*NL*
holy
love
?
This
child
of
its
father
's
guilt
and
its
mother
's
*NL*
shame
has
come
from
the
hand
of
God
,
to
work
in
many
ways
upon
*NL*
her
heart
,
who
pleads
so
earnestly
and
with
such
bitterness
of
*NL*
spirit
the
right
to
keep
her
.
It
was
meant
for
a
blessing
--
for
*NL*
the
one
blessing
of
her
life
!
It
was
meant
,
doubtless
,
the
*NL*
mother
herself
hath
told
us
,
for
a
retribution
,
too
;
a
torture
*NL*
to
be
felt
at
many
an
unthought-of
moment
;
a
pang
,
a
sting
,
an
*NL*
ever-recurring
agony
,
in
the
midst
of
a
troubled
joy
!
Hath
she
*NL*
not
expressed
this
thought
in
the
garb
of
the
poor
child
,
so
*NL*
forcibly
reminding
us
of
that
red
symbol
which
sears
her
bosom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
said
again
!
''
cried
good
Mr.
Wilson
.
``
I
feared
the
woman
*NL*
had
no
better
thought
than
to
make
a
mountebank
of
her
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
so
!
--
not
so
!
''
continued
Mr.
Dimmesdale
.
``
She
*NL*
recognises
,
believe
me
,
the
solemn
miracle
which
God
hath
*NL*
wrought
in
the
existence
of
that
child
.
And
may
she
feel
,
*NL*
too
--
what
,
methinks
,
is
the
very
truth
--
that
this
boon
was
*NL*
meant
,
above
all
things
else
,
to
keep
the
mother
's
soul
alive
,
*NL*
and
to
preserve
her
from
blacker
depths
of
sin
into
which
Satan
*NL*
might
else
have
sought
to
plunge
her
!
Therefore
it
is
good
for
*NL*
this
poor
,
sinful
woman
,
that
she
hath
an
infant
immortality
,
a
*NL*
being
capable
of
eternal
joy
or
sorrow
,
confided
to
her
care
--
to
*NL*
be
trained
up
by
her
to
righteousness
,
to
remind
her
,
at
every
*NL*
moment
,
of
her
fall
,
but
yet
to
teach
her
,
as
if
it
were
by
the
*NL*
Creator
's
sacred
pledge
,
that
,
if
she
bring
the
child
to
heaven
,
*NL*
the
child
also
will
bring
its
parents
thither
!
Herein
is
the
*NL*
sinful
mother
happier
than
the
sinful
father
.
For
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
's
sake
,
then
,
and
no
less
for
the
poor
child
's
sake
,
let
*NL*
us
leave
them
as
Providence
hath
seen
fit
to
place
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
,
my
friend
,
with
a
strange
earnestness
,
''
said
old
*NL*
Roger
Chillingworth
,
smiling
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
is
a
weighty
import
in
what
my
young
brother
hath
*NL*
spoken

added
the
Rev.
Mr.
Wilson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
say
you
,
worshipful
Master
Bellingham
?
Hath
he
not
*NL*
pleaded
well
for
the
poor
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
hath
he
,
''
answered
the
magistrate
;
``
and
hath
adduced
*NL*
such
arguments
,
that
we
will
even
leave
the
matter
as
it
now

stands
;
so
long
,
at

,
as
there
shall
be
no
further
scandal
*NL*
in

Care
must

put
the

to
*NL*
due
and
stated
examination
in
the
catechism
,
at
thy
hands

*NL*
Master
Dimmesdale
's
.
Moreover
,
at
a
proper
season
,
the
*NL*
tithing-men
must
take
heed
that
she
go
both
to
school
and
to
*NL*
meeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
minister
,
on
ceasing
to
speak
had
withdrawn
a
few
*NL*
steps
from
the
group
,
and
stood
with
his
face
partially
*NL*
concealed
in
the
heavy
folds
of
the
window-curtain
;
while
the
*NL*
shadow
of
his
figure
,
which
the
sunlight
cast
upon
the
floor
,
*NL*
was
tremulous
with
the
vehemence
of
his
appeal
.
Pearl
,
that
wild
*NL*
and
flighty
little
elf
stole
softly
towards
him
,
and
taking
his
*NL*
hand
in
the
grasp
of
both
her
own
,
laid
her
cheek
against
it
;
a
*NL*
caress
so
tender
,
and
withal
so
unobtrusive
,
that
her
mother
,
*NL*
who
was
looking
on
,
asked
herself
--
``
Is
that
my
Pearl
?
''
Yet
she
*NL*
knew
that
there
was
love
in
the
child
's
heart
,
although
it
*NL*
mostly
revealed
itself
in
passion
,
and
hardly
twice
in
her
*NL*
lifetime
had
been
softened
by
such
gentleness
as
now
.
The
*NL*
minister
--
for
,
save
the
long-sought
regards
of
woman
,
nothing
is
*NL*
sweeter
than
these
marks
of
childish
preference
,
accorded
*NL*
spontaneously
by
a
spiritual
instinct
,
and
therefore
seeming
to
*NL*
imply
in
us
something
truly
worthy
to
be
loved
--
the
minister
*NL*
looked
round
,
laid
his
hand
on
the
child
's
head
,
hesitated
an
*NL*
instant
,
and
then
kissed
her
brow
.
Little
Pearl
's
unwonted
mood
*NL*
of
sentiment
lasted
no
longer
;
she
laughed
,
and
went
capering
*NL*
down
the
hall
so
airily
,
that
old
Mr.
Wilson
raised
a
question
*NL*
whether
even
her
tiptoes
touched
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
baggage
hath
witchcraft
in
her
,
I
profess
,
''
said
he
*NL*
to
Mr.
Dimmesdale
.
``
She
needs
no
old
woman
's
broomstick
to
fly
*NL*
withal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
strange
child
!
''
remarked
old
Roger
Chillingworth
.
``
It
is
*NL*
easy
to
see
the

part
in
her

Would
it
be
beyond
a

philosopher
's
research
,
think
ye
,
gentlemen
,
to
analyse
that
*NL*
child
's
nature
,
and
,
from
it
make
a
mould
,
to
give
a
shrewd
*NL*
guess
at
the
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
;
it
would
be
sinful
,
in
such
a
question
,
to
follow
the
clue
*NL*
of
profane
philosophy

said
Mr.
Wilson
.
``
Better
to
fast
and
*NL*
pray
upon
it
;
and
still
better
,
it
may
be
,
to
leave
the
mystery
*NL*
as
we
find
it
,
unless
Providence
reveal
it
of
its
own
accord

*NL*
Thereby
,
every
good
Christian
man
hath
a
title
to
show
a
*NL*
father
's
kindness
towards
the
poor
,
deserted
babe

*NL*
*NL*
The
affair
being
so
satisfactorily
concluded
,
Hester
Prynne
,
*NL*
with
Pearl
,
departed
from
the
house
.
As
they
descended
the
*NL*
steps
,
it
is
averred
that
the
lattice
of
a
chamber-window
was
*NL*
thrown
open
,
and
forth
into
the
sunny
day
was
thrust
the
face
of
*NL*
Mistress
Hibbins
,
Governor
Bellingham
's
bitter-tempered
sister
,
*NL*
and
the
same
who
,
a
few
years
later
,
was
executed
as
a
witch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hist
,
hist
!
''
said
she
,
while
her
ill-omened
physiognomy
seemed
*NL*
to
cast
a
shadow
over
the
cheerful
newness
of
the
house
.
``
Wilt
*NL*
thou
go
with
us
to-night
?
There
will
be
a
merry
company
in
the
*NL*
forest

I
well-nigh
promised
the
Black
Man
that
comely

Hester
Prynne
should
make
one
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
my
excuse

answered
Hester
,
with
a
*NL*
triumphant
smile
.
``
I
must
tarry
at

gone
with
thee
into
the
forest
,
and
signed
my
name
in
the
Black
*NL*
Man
's
book
too
,
and
that
with
mine
own
blood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
have
thee
there
anon
!
''
said
the
witch-lady
,
frowning
,
*NL*
as
she
drew
back
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
--
if
we
suppose
this
interview
betwixt
Mistress
Hibbins
*NL*
and
Hester
Prynne
to
be
authentic
,
and
not
a
parable
--
was
*NL*
already
an
illustration
of
the
young
minister
's
argument
against
*NL*
sundering
the
relation
of
a
fallen
mother
to
the
offspring
of
*NL*
her
frailty
.
Even
thus
early
had
the
child
saved
her
from
*NL*
Satan
's
snare
.

IX

THE
LEECH
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
appellation
of
Roger
Chillingworth
,
the
reader
will
*NL*
remember
,
was
hidden
another
name
,
which
its
former
wearer
had
*NL*
resolved
should
never
more
be
spoken
.
It
has
been
related
,
how
,
*NL*
in
the
crowd
that
witnessed
Hester
Prynne
's
ignominious
*NL*
exposure
,
stood
a
man
,
elderly
,
travel-worn
,
who
,
just
emerging
*NL*
from
the
perilous
wilderness
,
beheld
the
woman
,
in
whom
he
hoped
*NL*
to
find
embodied
the
warmth
and
cheerfulness
of
home
,
set
up
as
*NL*
a
type
of
sin
before
the
people
.
Her
matronly
fame
was
trodden
*NL*
under
all
men
's
feet
.
Infamy
was
babbling
around
her
in
the
*NL*
public
market-place
.
For
her
kindred
,
should
the
tidings
ever
*NL*
reach
them
,
and
for
the
companions
of
her
unspotted
life
,
there
*NL*
remained
nothing
but
the
contagion
of
her
dishonour
;
which
would
*NL*
not
fail
to
be
distributed
in
strict
accordance
and
proportion
*NL*
with
the
intimacy
and
sacredness
of
their
previous
relationship
.
*NL*
Then
why
--
since
the
choice
was
with
himself
--
should
the
*NL*
individual
,
whose
connexion
with
the
fallen
woman
had
been
the
*NL*
most
intimate
and
sacred
of
them
all
,
come
forward
to
vindicate
*NL*
his
claim
to
an
inheritance
so
little
desirable
?
He
resolved
not
*NL*
to
be
pilloried
beside
her
on
her
pedestal
of
shame
.
Unknown
to
*NL*
all
but
Hester
Prynne
,
and
possessing
the
lock
and
key
of
her
*NL*
silence
,
he
chose
to
withdraw
his
name
from
the
roll
of
mankind
,
*NL*
and
,
as
regarded
his
former
ties
and
interest
,
to
vanish
out
of
*NL*
life
as
completely
as
if
he
indeed
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
ocean
,
whither
rumour
had
long
ago
consigned
him
.
This
purpose
*NL*
once
effected
,
new
interests
would
immediately
spring
up
,
and
*NL*
likewise
a
new
purpose
;
dark
,
it
is
true
,
if
not
guilty
,
but
of
*NL*
force
enough
to
engage
the
full
strength
of
his
faculties
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
pursuance
of
this
resolve
,
he
took
up
his
residence
in
the
*NL*
Puritan
town
as
Roger
Chillingworth
,
without
other
introduction
*NL*
than
the
learning
and
intelligence
of
which
he
possessed
more
*NL*
than
a
common
measure
.
As
his
studies
,
at
a
previous
period
of
*NL*
his
life
,
had
made
him
extensively
acquainted
with
the
medical
*NL*
science
of
the
day
,
it
was
as
a
physician
that
he
presented
*NL*
himself
and
as
such
was
cordially
received
.
Skilful
men
,
of
the
*NL*
medical
and
chirurgical
profession
,
were
of
rare
occurrence
in
*NL*
the
colony
.
They
seldom
,
it
would
appear
,
partook
of
the
*NL*
religious
zeal
that
brought
other
emigrants
across
the
Atlantic
.
*NL*
In
their
researches
into
the
human
frame
,
it
may
be
that
the
*NL*
higher
and
more
subtle
faculties
of
such
men
were
materialised
,
*NL*
and
that
they
lost
the
spiritual
view
of
existence
amid
the
*NL*
intricacies
of
that
wondrous
mechanism
,
which
seemed
to
involve
*NL*
art
enough
to
comprise
all
of
life
within
itself
.
At
all
events
,
*NL*
the
health
of
the
good
town
of
Boston
,
so
far
as
medicine
had
*NL*
aught
to
do
with
it
,
had
hitherto
lain
in
the
guardianship
of
an
*NL*
aged
deacon
and
apothecary
,
whose
piety
and
godly
deportment
*NL*
were
stronger
testimonials
in
his
favour
than
any
that
he
could
*NL*
have
produced
in
the
shape
of
a
diploma
.
The
only
surgeon
was
*NL*
one
who
combined
the
occasional
exercise
of
that
noble
art
with
*NL*
the
daily
and
habitual
flourish
of
a
razor
.
To
such
a
*NL*
professional
body
Roger
Chillingworth
was
a
brilliant
*NL*
acquisition
.
He
soon
manifested
his
familiarity
with
the
*NL*
ponderous
and
imposing
machinery
of
antique
physic
;
in
which
*NL*
every
remedy
contained
a
multitude
of
far-fetched
and
*NL*
heterogeneous
ingredients
,
as
elaborately
compounded
as
if
the
*NL*
proposed
result
had
been
the
Elixir
of
Life
.
In
his
Indian
*NL*
captivity
,
moreover
,
he
had
gained
much
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
properties
of
native
herbs
and
roots
;
nor
did
he
conceal
from
*NL*
his
patients
that
these
simple
medicines
,
Nature
's
boon
to
the
*NL*
untutored
savage
,
had
quite
as
large
a
share
of
his
own
*NL*
confidence
as
the
European
Pharmacopoeia
,
which
so
many
learned
*NL*
doctors
had
spent
centuries
in
elaborating
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
learned
stranger
was
exemplary
as
regarded
at
least
the
*NL*
outward
forms
of
a
religious
life
;
and
early
after
his
arrival
,
*NL*
had
chosen
for
his
spiritual
guide
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
.
*NL*
The
young
divine
,
whose
scholar-like
renown
still
lived
in
*NL*
Oxford
,
was
considered
by
his
more
fervent
admirers
as
little
*NL*
less
than
a
heavenly
ordained
apostle
,
destined
,
should
he
live
*NL*
and
labour
for
the
ordinary
term
of
life
,
to
do
as
great
deeds
,
*NL*
for
the
now
feeble
New
England
Church
,
as
the
early
Fathers
had
*NL*
achieved
for
the
infancy
of
the
Christian
faith
.
About
this
*NL*
period
,
however
,
the
health
of
Mr.
Dimmesdale
had
evidently
*NL*
begun
to
fail
.
By
those
best
acquainted
with
his
habits
,
the
*NL*
paleness
of
the
young
minister
's
cheek
was
accounted
for
by
his
*NL*
too
earnest
devotion
to
study
,
his
scrupulous
fulfilment
of
*NL*
parochial
duty
,
and
more
than
all
,
to
the
fasts
and
vigils
of
*NL*
which
he
made
a
frequent
practice
,
in
order
to
keep
the
*NL*
grossness
of
this
earthly
state
from
clogging
and
obscuring
his
*NL*
spiritual
lamp
.
Some
declared
,
that
if
Mr.
Dimmesdale
were
*NL*
really
going
to
die
,
it
was
cause
enough
that
the
world
was
not
*NL*
worthy
to
be
any
longer
trodden
by
his
feet
.
He
himself
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
with
characteristic
humility
,
avowed
his
belief
that
*NL*
if
Providence
should
see
fit
to
remove
him
,
it
would
be
because
*NL*
of
his
own
unworthiness
to
perform
its
humblest
mission
here
on
*NL*
earth
.
With
all
this
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
cause
of
*NL*
his
decline
,
there
could
be
no
question
of
the
fact
.
His
form
*NL*
grew
emaciated
;
his
voice
,
though
still
rich
and
sweet
,
had
a
*NL*
certain
melancholy
prophecy
of
decay
in
it
;
he
was
often
*NL*
observed
,
on
any
slight
alarm
or
other
sudden
accident
,
to
put
*NL*
his
hand
over
his
heart
with
first
a
flush
and
then
a
paleness
,
*NL*
indicative
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
young
clergyman
's
condition
,
and
so
imminent
the
*NL*
prospect
that
his
dawning
light
would
be
extinguished
,
all
*NL*
untimely
,
when
Roger
Chillingworth
made
his
advent
to
the
town
.
*NL*
His
first
entry
on
the
scene
,
few
people
could
tell
whence
,
*NL*
dropping
down
as
it
were
out
of
the
sky
or
starting
from
the
*NL*
nether
earth
,
had
an
aspect
of
mystery
,
which
was
easily
*NL*
heightened
to
the
miraculous
.
He
was
now
known
to
be
a
man
of
*NL*
skill
;
it
was
observed
that
he
gathered
herbs
and
the
blossoms
*NL*
of
wild-flowers
,
and
dug
up
roots
and
plucked
off
twigs
from
the
*NL*
forest-trees
like
one
acquainted
with
hidden
virtues
in
what
was
*NL*
valueless
to
common
eyes
.
He
was
heard
to
speak
of
Sir
Kenelm
*NL*
Digby
and
other
famous
men
--
whose
scientific
attainments
were
*NL*
esteemed
hardly
less
than
supernatural
--
as
having
been
his
*NL*
correspondents
or
associates
.
Why
,
with
such
rank
in
the
learned
*NL*
world
,
had
he
come
hither
?
What
,
could
he
,
whose
sphere
was
in
*NL*
great
cities
,
be
seeking
in
the
wilderness
?
In
answer
to
this
*NL*
query
,
a
rumour
gained
ground
--
and
however
absurd
,
was
*NL*
entertained
by
some
very
sensible
people
--
that
Heaven
had
*NL*
wrought
an
absolute
miracle
,
by
transporting
an
eminent
Doctor
*NL*
of
Physic
from
a
German
university
bodily
through
the
air
and
*NL*
setting
him
down
at
the
door
of
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
study
!
*NL*
Individuals
of
wiser
faith
,
indeed
,
who
knew
that
Heaven
*NL*
promotes
its
purposes
without
aiming
at
the
stage-effect
of
what
*NL*
is
called
miraculous
interposition
,
were
inclined
to
see
a
*NL*
providential
hand
in
Roger
Chillingworth
's
so
opportune
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
was
countenanced
by
the
strong
interest
which
the
*NL*
physician
ever
manifested
in
the
young
clergyman
;
he
attached
*NL*
himself
to
him
as
a
parishioner
,
and
sought
to
win
a
friendly
*NL*
regard
and
confidence
from
his
naturally
reserved
sensibility
.
*NL*
He
expressed
great
alarm
at
his
pastor
's
state
of
health
,
but
*NL*
was
anxious
to
attempt
the
cure
,
and
,
if
early
undertaken
,
*NL*
seemed
not
despondent
of
a
favourable
result
.
The
elders
,
the
*NL*
deacons
,
the
motherly
dames
,
and
the
young
and
fair
maidens
of
*NL*
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
flock
,
were
alike
importunate
that
he
should
*NL*
make
trial
of
the
physician
's
frankly
offered
skill
.
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
gently
repelled
their
entreaties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
no
medicine
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
could
the
young
minister
say
so
,
when
,
with
every
*NL*
successive
Sabbath
,
his
cheek
was
paler
and
thinner
,
and
his
*NL*
voice
more
tremulous
than
before
--
when
it
had
now
become
a
*NL*
constant
habit
,
rather
than
a
casual
gesture
,
to
press
his
hand
*NL*
over
his
heart
?
Was
he
weary
of
his
labours
?
Did
he
wish
to
die
?
*NL*
These
questions
were
solemnly
propounded
to
Mr.
Dimmesdale
by
*NL*
the
elder
ministers
of
Boston
,
and
the
deacons
of
his
church
,
*NL*
who
,
to
use
their
own
phrase
,
``
dealt
with
him
,
''
on
the
sin
of
*NL*
rejecting
the
aid
which
Providence
so
manifestly
held
out
.
He
*NL*
listened
in
silence
,
and
finally
promised
to
confer
with
the
*NL*
physician
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
it
God
's
will
,
''
said
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
when
,
in
*NL*
fulfilment
of
this
pledge
,
he
requested
old
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
's
professional
advice
,
``
I
could
be
well
content
*NL*
that
my
labours
,
and
my
sorrows
,
and
my
sins
,
and
my
pains
,
*NL*
should
shortly
end
with
me
,
and
what
is
earthly
of
them
be
*NL*
buried
in
my
grave
,
and
the
spiritual
go
with
me
to
my
eternal
*NL*
state
,
rather
than
that
you
should
put
your
skill
to
the
proof
*NL*
in
my
behalf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
replied
Roger
Chillingworth
,
with
that
quietness
,
which
,
*NL*
whether
imposed
or
natural
,
marked
all
his
deportment
,
``
it
is
*NL*
thus
that
a
young
clergyman
is
apt
to
speak
.
Youthful
men
,
not
*NL*
having
taken
a
deep
root
,
give
up
their
hold
of
life
so
easily
!
*NL*
And
saintly
men
,
who
walk
with
God
on
earth
,
would
fain
be
away
,
*NL*
to
walk
with
him
on
the
golden
pavements
of
the
New
Jerusalem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
rejoined
the
young
minister
,
putting
his
hand
to
his
*NL*
heart
,
with
a
flush
of
pain
flitting
over
his
brow
,
``
were
I
*NL*
worthier
to
walk
there
,
I
could
be
better
content
to
toil
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
men
ever
interpret
themselves
too
meanly
,
''
said
the
*NL*
physician
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
,
the
mysterious
old
Roger
Chillingworth
became
*NL*
the
medical
adviser
of
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
.
As
not
only
*NL*
the
disease
interested
the
physician
,
but
he
was
strongly
moved
*NL*
to
look
into
the
character
and
qualities
of
the
patient
,
these
*NL*
two
men
,
so
different
in
age
,
came
gradually
to
spend
much
time
*NL*
together
.
For
the
sake
of
the
minister
's
health
,
and
to
enable
*NL*
the
leech
to
gather
plants
with
healing
balm
in
them
,
they
took
*NL*
long
walks
on
the
sea-shore
,
or
in
the
forest
;
mingling
various
*NL*
walks
with
the
splash
and
murmur
of
the
waves
,
and
the
solemn
*NL*
wind-anthem
among
the
tree-tops
.
Often
,
likewise
,
one
was
the
*NL*
guest
of
the
other
in
his
place
of
study
and
retirement
.
There
*NL*
was
a
fascination
for
the
minister
in
the
company
of
the
man
of
*NL*
science
,
in
whom
he
recognised
an
intellectual
cultivation
of
no
*NL*
moderate
depth
or
scope
;
together
with
a
range
and
freedom
of
*NL*
ideas
,
that
he
would
have
vainly
looked
for
among
the
members
of
*NL*
his
own
profession
.
In
truth
,
he
was
startled
,
if
not
shocked
,
*NL*
to
find
this
attribute
in
the
physician
.
Mr.
Dimmesdale
was
a
*NL*
true
priest
,
a
true
religionist
,
with
the
reverential
sentiment
*NL*
largely
developed
,
and
an
order
of
mind
that
impelled
itself
*NL*
powerfully
along
the
track
of
a
creed
,
and
wore
its
passage
*NL*
continually
deeper
with
the
lapse
of
time
.
In
no
state
of
*NL*
society
would
he
have
been
what
is
called
a
man
of
liberal
*NL*
views
;
it
would
always
be
essential
to
his
peace
to
feel
the
*NL*
pressure
of
a
faith
about
him
,
supporting
,
while
it
confined
him
*NL*
within
its
iron
framework
.
Not
the
less
,
however
,
though
with
a
*NL*
tremulous
enjoyment
,
did
he
feel
the
occasional
relief
of
*NL*
looking
at
the
universe
through
the
medium
of
another
kind
of
*NL*
intellect
than
those
with
which
he
habitually
held
converse
.
It
*NL*
was
as
if
a
window
were
thrown
open
,
admitting
a
freer
*NL*
atmosphere
into
the
close
and
stifled
study
,
where
his
life
was
*NL*
wasting
itself
away
,
amid
lamp-light
,
or
obstructed
day-beams
,
*NL*
and
the
musty
fragrance
,
be
it
sensual
or
moral
,
that
exhales
*NL*
from
books
.
But
the
air
was
too
fresh
and
chill
to
be
long
*NL*
breathed
with
comfort
.
So
the
minister
,
and
the
physician
with
*NL*
him
,
withdrew
again
within
the
limits
of
what
their
Church
*NL*
defined
as
orthodox
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Roger
Chillingworth
scrutinised
his
patient
carefully
,
both
*NL*
as
he
saw
him
in
his
ordinary
life
,
keeping
an
accustomed
*NL*
pathway
in
the
range
of
thoughts
familiar
to
him
,
and
as
he
*NL*
appeared
when
thrown
amidst
other
moral
scenery
,
the
novelty
of
*NL*
which
might
call
out
something
new
to
the
surface
of
his
*NL*
character
.
He
deemed
it
essential
,
it
would
seem
,
to
know
the
*NL*
man
,
before
attempting
to
do
him
good
.
Wherever
there
is
a
heart
*NL*
and
an
intellect
,
the
diseases
of
the
physical
frame
are
tinged
*NL*
with
the
peculiarities
of
these
.
In
Arthur
Dimmesdale
,
thought
*NL*
and
imagination
were
so
active
,
and
sensibility
so
intense
,
that
*NL*
the
bodily
infirmity
would
be
likely
to
have
its
groundwork
*NL*
there
.
So
Roger
Chillingworth
--
the
man
of
skill
,
the
kind
and
*NL*
friendly
physician
--
strove
to
go
deep
into
his
patient
's
bosom
,
*NL*
delving
among
his
principles
,
prying
into
his
recollections
,
and
*NL*
probing
everything
with
a
cautious
touch
,
like
a
treasure-seeker
*NL*
in
a
dark
cavern
.
Few
secrets
can
escape
an
investigator
,
who
*NL*
has
opportunity
and
licence
to
undertake
such
a
quest
,
and
skill
*NL*
to
follow
it
up
.
A
man
burdened
with
a
secret
should
especially
*NL*
avoid
the
intimacy
of
his
physician
.
If
the
latter
possess
*NL*
native
sagacity
,
and
a
nameless
something
more
,
--
let
us
call
it
*NL*
intuition
;
if
he
show
no
intrusive
egotism
,
nor
disagreeable
*NL*
prominent
characteristics
of
his
own
;
if
he
have
the
power
,
*NL*
which
must
be
born
with
him
,
to
bring
his
mind
into
such
*NL*
affinity
with
his
patient
's
,
that
this
last
shall
unawares
have
*NL*
spoken
what
he
imagines
himself
only
to
have
thought
;
if
such
*NL*
revelations
be
received
without
tumult
,
and
acknowledged
not
so
*NL*
often
by
an
uttered
sympathy
as
by
silence
,
an
inarticulate
*NL*
breath
,
and
here
and
there
a
word
to
indicate
that
all
is
*NL*
understood
;
if
to
these
qualifications
of
a
confidant
be
joined
*NL*
the
advantages
afforded
by
his
recognised
character
as
a
*NL*
physician
;
--
then
,
at
some
inevitable
moment
,
will
the
soul
of
*NL*
the
sufferer
be
dissolved
,
and
flow
forth
in
a
dark
but
*NL*
transparent
stream
,
bringing
all
its
mysteries
into
the
*NL*
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Roger
Chillingworth
possessed
all
,
or
most
,
of
the
attributes
*NL*
above
enumerated
.
Nevertheless
,
time
went
on
;
a
kind
of
*NL*
intimacy
,
as
we
have
said
,
grew
up
between
these
two
cultivated
*NL*
minds
,
which
had
as
wide
a
field
as
the
whole
sphere
of
human
*NL*
thought
and
study
to
meet
upon
;
they
discussed
every
topic
of
*NL*
ethics
and
religion
,
of
public
affairs
,
and
private
character
;
*NL*
they
talked
much
,
on
both
sides
,
of
matters
that
seemed
personal
*NL*
to
themselves
;
and
yet
no
secret
,
such
as
the
physician
fancied
*NL*
must
exist
there
,
ever
stole
out
of
the
minister
's
consciousness
*NL*
into
his
companion
's
ear
.
The
latter
had
his
suspicions
,
indeed
,
*NL*
that
even
the
nature
of
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
bodily
disease
had
*NL*
never
fairly
been
revealed
to
him
.
It
was
a
strange
reserve
!
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
,
at
a
hint
from
Roger
Chillingworth
,
the
friends
of
*NL*
Mr.
Dimmesdale
effected
an
arrangement
by
which
the
two
were
*NL*
lodged
in
the
same
house
;
so
that
every
ebb
and
flow
of
the
*NL*
minister
's
life-tide
might
pass
under
the
eye
of
his
anxious
and
*NL*
attached
physician
.
There
was
much
joy
throughout
the
town
when
*NL*
this
greatly
desirable
object
was
attained
.
It
was
held
to
be
*NL*
the
best
possible
measure
for
the
young
clergyman
's
welfare
;
*NL*
unless
,
indeed
,
as
often
urged
by
such
as
felt
authorised
to
do
*NL*
so
,
he
had
selected
some
one
of
the
many
blooming
damsels
,
*NL*
spiritually
devoted
to
him
,
to
become
his
devoted
wife
.
This
*NL*
latter
step
,
however
,
there
was
no
present
prospect
that
Arthur
*NL*
Dimmesdale
would
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
;
he
rejected
all
*NL*
suggestions
of
the
kind
,
as
if
priestly
celibacy
were
one
of
his
*NL*
articles
of
Church
discipline
.
Doomed
by
his
own
choice
,
*NL*
therefore
,
as
Mr.
Dimmesdale
so
evidently
was
,
to
eat
his
*NL*
unsavoury
morsel
always
at
another
's
board
,
and
endure
the
*NL*
life-long
chill
which
must
be
his
lot
who
seeks
to
warm
himself
*NL*
only
at
another
's
fireside
,
it
truly
seemed
that
this
sagacious
,
*NL*
experienced
,
benevolent
old
physician
,
with
his
concord
of
*NL*
paternal
and
reverential
love
for
the
young
pastor
,
was
the
very
*NL*
man
,
of
all
mankind
,
to
be
constantly
within
reach
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
abode
of
the
two
friends
was
with
a
pious
widow
,
of
good
*NL*
social
rank
,
who
dwelt
in
a
house
covering
pretty
nearly
the
*NL*
site
on
which
the
venerable
structure
of
King
's
Chapel
has
since
*NL*
been
built
.
It
had
the
graveyard
,
originally
Isaac
Johnson
's
*NL*
home-field
,
on
one
side
,
and
so
was
well
adapted
to
call
up
*NL*
serious
reflections
,
suited
to
their
respective
employments
,
in
*NL*
both
minister
and
man
of
physic
.
The
motherly
care
of
the
good
*NL*
widow
assigned
to
Mr.
Dimmesdale
a
front
apartment
,
with
a
sunny
*NL*
exposure
,
and
heavy
window-curtains
,
to
create
a
noontide
shadow
*NL*
when
desirable
.
The
walls
were
hung
round
with
tapestry
,
said
to
*NL*
be
from
the
Gobelin
looms
,
and
,
at
all
events
,
representing
the
*NL*
Scriptural
story
of
David
and
Bathsheba
,
and
Nathan
the
Prophet
,
*NL*
in
colours
still
unfaded
,
but
which
made
the
fair
woman
of
the
*NL*
scene
almost
as
grimly
picturesque
as
the
woe-denouncing
seer
.
*NL*
Here
the
pale
clergyman
piled
up
his
library
,
rich
with
*NL*
parchment-bound
folios
of
the
Fathers
,
and
the
lore
of
Rabbis
,
*NL*
and
monkish
erudition
,
of
which
the
Protestant
divines
,
even
*NL*
while
they
vilified
and
decried
that
class
of
writers
,
were
yet
*NL*
constrained
often
to
avail
themselves
.
On
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
house
,
old
Roger
Chillingworth
arranged
his
study
and
*NL*
laboratory
:
not
such
as
a
modern
man
of
science
would
reckon
*NL*
even
tolerably
complete
,
but
provided
with
a
distilling
*NL*
apparatus
and
the
means
of
compounding
drugs
and
chemicals
,
*NL*
which
the
practised
alchemist
knew
well
how
to
turn
to
purpose
.
*NL*
With
such
commodiousness
of
situation
,
these
two
learned
persons
*NL*
sat
themselves
down
,
each
in
his
own
domain
,
yet
familiarly
*NL*
passing
from
one
apartment
to
the
other
,
and
bestowing
a
mutual
*NL*
and
not
incurious
inspection
into
one
another
's
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
Reverend
Arthur
Dimmesdale
's
best
discerning
friends
,
as
*NL*
we
have
intimated
,
very
reasonably
imagined
that
the
hand
of
*NL*
Providence
had
done
all
this
for
the
purpose
--
besought
in
so
*NL*
many
public
and
domestic
and
secret
prayers
--
of
restoring
the
*NL*
young
minister
to
health
.
But
,
it
must
now
be
said
,
another
*NL*
portion
of
the
community
had
latterly
begun
to
take
its
own
view
*NL*
of
the
relation
betwixt
Mr.
Dimmesdale
and
the
mysterious
old
*NL*
physician
.
When
an
uninstructed
multitude
attempts
to
see
with
*NL*
its
eyes
,
it
is
exceedingly
apt
to
be
deceived
.
When
,
however
,
*NL*
it
forms
its
judgment
,
as
it
usually
does
,
on
the
intuitions
of
*NL*
its
great
and
warm
heart
,
the
conclusions
thus
attained
are
*NL*
often
so
profound
and
so
unerring
as
to
possess
the
character
of
*NL*
truth
supernaturally
revealed
.
The
people
,
in
the
case
of
which
*NL*
we
speak
,
could
justify
its
prejudice
against
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
by
no
fact
or
argument
worthy
of
serious
*NL*
refutation
.
There
was
an
aged
handicraftsman
,
it
is
true
,
who
*NL*
had
been
a
citizen
of
London
at
the
period
of
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
Overbury
's
murder
,
now
some
thirty
years
agone
;
he
testified
to
*NL*
having
seen
the
physician
,
under
some
other
name
,
which
the
*NL*
narrator
of
the
story
had
now
forgotten
,
in
company
with
Dr.
*NL*
Forman
,
the
famous
old
conjurer
,
who
was
implicated
in
the
*NL*
affair
of
Overbury
.
Two
or
three
individuals
hinted
that
the
man
*NL*
of
skill
,
during
his
Indian
captivity
,
had
enlarged
his
medical
*NL*
attainments
by
joining
in
the
incantations
of
the
savage
*NL*
priests
,
who
were
universally
acknowledged
to
be
powerful
*NL*
enchanters
,
often
performing
seemingly
miraculous
cures
by
their
*NL*
skill
in
the
black
art
.
A
large
number
--
and
many
of
these
were
*NL*
persons
of
such
sober
sense
and
practical
observation
that
their
*NL*
opinions
would
have
been
valuable
in
other
matters
--
affirmed
*NL*
that
Roger
Chillingworth
's
aspect
had
undergone
a
remarkable
*NL*
change
while
he
had
dwelt
in
town
,
and
especially
since
his
*NL*
abode
with
Mr.
Dimmesdale
.
At
first
,
his
expression
had
been
*NL*
calm
,
meditative
,
scholar-like
.
Now
there
was
something
ugly
and
*NL*
evil
in
his
face
,
which
they
had
not
previously
noticed
,
and
*NL*
which
grew
still
the
more
obvious
to
sight
the
oftener
they
*NL*
looked
upon
him
.
According
to
the
vulgar
idea
,
the
fire
in
his
*NL*
laboratory
had
been
brought
from
the
lower
regions
,
and
was
fed
*NL*
with
infernal
fuel
;
and
so
,
as
might
be
expected
,
his
visage
was
*NL*
getting
sooty
with
the
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
sum
up
the
matter
,
it
grew
to
be
a
widely
diffused
opinion
*NL*
that
the
Rev.
Arthur
Dimmesdale
,
like
many
other
personages
of
*NL*
special
sanctity
,
in
all
ages
of
the
Christian
world
,
was
*NL*
haunted
either
by
Satan
himself
or
Satan
's
emissary
,
in
the
*NL*
guise
of
old
Roger
Chillingworth
.
This
diabolical
agent
had
the
*NL*
Divine
permission
,
for
a
season
,
to
burrow
into
the
clergyman
's
*NL*
intimacy
,
and
plot
against
his
soul
.
No
sensible
man
,
it
was
*NL*
confessed
,
could
doubt
on
which
side
the
victory
would
turn
.
The
*NL*
people
looked
,
with
an
unshaken
hope
,
to
see
the
minister
come
*NL*
forth
out
of
the
conflict
transfigured
with
the
glory
which
he
*NL*
would
unquestionably
win
.
Meanwhile
,
nevertheless
,
it
was
sad
to
*NL*
think
of
the
perchance
mortal
agony
through
which
he
must
*NL*
struggle
towards
his
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
to
judge
from
the
gloom
and
terror
in
the
depth
of
the
*NL*
poor
minister
's
eyes
,
the
battle
was
a
sore
one
,
and
the
victory
*NL*
anything
but
secure
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
X
.
THE
LEECH
AND
HIS
PATIENT
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Roger
Chillingworth
,
throughout
life
,
had
been
calm
in
*NL*
temperament
,
kindly
,
though
not
of
warm
affections
,
but
ever
,
*NL*
and
in
all
his
relations
with
the
world
,
a
pure
and
upright
man
.
*NL*
He
had
begun
an
investigation
,
as
he
imagined
,
with
the
severe
*NL*
and
equal
integrity
of
a
judge
,
desirous
only
of
truth
,
even
as
*NL*
if
the
question
involved
no
more
than
the
air-drawn
lines
and
*NL*
figures
of
a
geometrical
problem
,
instead
of
human
passions
,
and
*NL*
wrongs
inflicted
on
himself
.
But
,
as
he
proceeded
,
a
terrible
*NL*
fascination
,
a
kind
of
fierce
,
though
still
calm
,
necessity
,
*NL*
seized
the
old
man
within
its
gripe
,
and
never
set
him
free
*NL*
again
until
he
had
done
all
its
bidding
.
He
now
dug
into
the
*NL*
poor
clergyman
's
heart
,
like
a
miner
searching
for
gold
;
or
,
*NL*
rather
,
like
a
sexton
delving
into
a
grave
,
possibly
in
quest
of
*NL*
a
jewel
that
had
been
buried
on
the
dead
man
's
bosom
,
but
likely
*NL*
to
find
nothing
save
mortality
and
corruption
.
Alas
,
for
his
own
*NL*
soul
,
if
these
were
what
he
sought
!
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
a
light
glimmered
out
of
the
physician
's
eyes
,
burning
*NL*
blue
and
ominous
,
like
the
reflection
of
a
furnace
,
or
,
let
us
*NL*
say
,
like
one
of
those
gleams
of
ghastly
fire
that
darted
from
*NL*
Bunyan
's
awful
doorway
in
the
hillside
,
and
quivered
on
the
*NL*
pilgrim
's
face
.
The
soil
where
this
dark
miner
was
working
had
*NL*
perchance
shown
indications
that
encouraged
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
man
,
''
said
he
,
at
one
such
moment
,
to
himself
,
``
pure
as
*NL*
they
deem
him
--
all
spiritual
as
he
seems
--
hath
inherited
a
*NL*
strong
animal
nature
from
his
father
or
his
mother
.
Let
us
dig
a
*NL*
little
further
in
the
direction
of
this
vein
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
after
long
search
into
the
minister
's
dim
interior
,
and
*NL*
turning
over
many
precious
materials
,
in
the
shape
of
high
*NL*
aspirations
for
the
welfare
of
his
race
,
warm
love
of
souls
,
*NL*
pure
sentiments
,
natural
piety
,
strengthened
by
thought
and
*NL*
study
,
and
illuminated
by
revelation
--
all
of
which
invaluable
*NL*
gold
was
perhaps
no
better
than
rubbish
to
the
seeker
--
he
would
*NL*
turn
back
,
discouraged
,
and
begin
his
quest
towards
another
*NL*
point
.
He
groped
along
as
stealthily
,
with
as
cautious
a
tread
,
*NL*
and
as
wary
an
outlook
,
as
a
thief
entering
a
chamber
where
a
*NL*
man
lies
only
half
asleep
--
or
,
it
may
be
,
broad
awake
--
with
*NL*
purpose
to
steal
the
very
treasure
which
this
man
guards
as
the
*NL*
apple
of
his
eye
.
In
spite
of
his
premeditated
carefulness
,
the
*NL*
floor
would
now
and
then
creak
;
his
garments
would
rustle
;
the
*NL*
shadow
of
his
presence
,
in
a
forbidden
proximity
,
would
be
*NL*
thrown
across
his
victim
.
In
other
words
,
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
whose
*NL*
sensibility
of
nerve
often
produced
the
effect
of
spiritual
*NL*
intuition
,
would
become
vaguely
aware
that
something
inimical
to
*NL*
his
peace
had
thrust
itself
into
relation
with
him
.
But
Old
*NL*
Roger
Chillingworth
,
too
,
had
perceptions
that
were
almost
*NL*
intuitive
;
and
when
the
minister
threw
his
startled
eyes
towards
*NL*
him
,
there
the
physician
sat
;
his
kind
,
watchful
,
sympathising
,
*NL*
but
never
intrusive
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Mr.
Dimmesdale
would
perhaps
have
seen
this
individual
's
*NL*
character
more
perfectly
,
if
a
certain
morbidness
,
to
which
sick
*NL*
hearts
are
liable
,
had
not
rendered
him
suspicious
of
all
*NL*
mankind
.
Trusting
no
man
as
his
friend
,
he
could
not
recognize
*NL*
his
enemy
when
the
latter
actually
appeared
.
He
therefore
still
*NL*
kept
up
a
familiar
intercourse
with
him
,
daily
receiving
the
old
*NL*
physician
in
his
study
,
or
visiting
the
laboratory
,
and
,
for
*NL*
recreation
's
sake
,
watching
the
processes
by
which
weeds
were
*NL*
converted
into
drugs
of
potency
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
leaning
his
forehead
on
his
hand
,
and
his
elbow
on
the
*NL*
sill
of
the
open
window
,
that
looked
towards
the
grave-yard
,
he
*NL*
talked
with
Roger
Chillingworth
,
while
the
old
man
was
examining
*NL*
a
bundle
of
unsightly
plants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
,
''
asked
he
,
with
a
look
askance
at
them
--
for
it
was
the
*NL*
clergyman
's
peculiarity
that
he
seldom
,
now-a-days
,
looked
*NL*
straight
forth
at
any
object
,
whether
human
or
inanimate
,
*NL*
``
where
,
my
kind
doctor
,
did
you
gather
those
herbs
,
with
such
a
*NL*
dark
,
flabby
leaf
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
in
the
graveyard
here
at
hand
,
''
answered
the
physician
,
*NL*
continuing
his
employment
.
``
They
are
new
to
me
.
I
found
them
*NL*
growing
on
a
grave
,
which
bore
no
tombstone
,
no
other
memorial
*NL*
of
the
dead
man
,
save
these
ugly
weeds
,
that
have
taken
upon
*NL*
themselves
to
keep
him
in
remembrance
.
They
grew
out
of
his
*NL*
heart
,
and
typify
,
it
may
be
,
some
hideous
secret
that
was
*NL*
buried
with
him
,
and
which
he
had
done
better
to
confess
during
*NL*
his
lifetime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perchance
,
''
said
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
``
he
earnestly
desired
it
,
but
*NL*
could
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
wherefore
?
''
rejoined
the
physician
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wherefore
not
;
since
all
the
powers
of
nature
call
so
earnestly
*NL*
for
the
confession
of
sin
,
that
these
black
weeds
have
sprung
up
*NL*
out
of
a
buried
heart
,
to
make
manifest
,
an
outspoken
crime
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
good
sir
,
is
but
a
phantasy
of
yours
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
minister
.
``
There
can
be
,
if
I
forbode
aright
,
no
power
,
short
of
*NL*
the
Divine
mercy
,
to
disclose
,
whether
by
uttered
words
,
or
by
*NL*
type
or
emblem
,
the
secrets
that
may
be
buried
in
the
human
*NL*
heart
.
The
heart
,
making
itself
guilty
of
such
secrets
,
must
*NL*
perforce
hold
them
,
until
the
day
when
all
hidden
things
shall
*NL*
be
revealed
.
Nor
have
I
so
read
or
interpreted
Holy
Writ
,
as
to
*NL*
understand
that
the
disclosure
of
human
thoughts
and
deeds
,
then
*NL*
to
be
made
,
is
intended
as
a
part
of
the
retribution
.
That
,
*NL*
surely
,
were
a
shallow
view
of
it
.
No
;
these
revelations
,
unless
*NL*
I
greatly
err
,
are
meant
merely
to
promote
the
intellectual
*NL*
satisfaction
of
all
intelligent
beings
,
who
will
stand
waiting
,
*NL*
on
that
day
,
to
see
the
dark
problem
of
this
life
made
plain
.
A
*NL*
knowledge
of
men
's
hearts
will
be
needful
to
the
completest
*NL*
solution
of
that
problem
.
And
,
I
conceive
moreover
,
that
the
*NL*
hearts
holding
such
miserable
secrets
as
you
speak
of
,
will
*NL*
yield
them
up
,
at
that
last
day
,
not
with
reluctance
,
but
with
a
*NL*
joy
unutterable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
not
reveal
it
here
?
''
asked
Roger
Chillingworth
,
*NL*
glancing
quietly
aside
at
the
minister
.
``
Why
should
not
the
*NL*
guilty
ones
sooner
avail
themselves
of
this
unutterable
solace
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
mostly
do
,
''
said
the
clergyman
,
griping
hard
at
his
*NL*
breast
,
as
if
afflicted
with
an
importunate
throb
of
pain
.
*NL*
``
Many
,
many
a
poor
soul
hath
given
its
confidence
to
me
,
not
*NL*
only
on
the
death-bed
,
but
while
strong
in
life
,
and
fair
in
*NL*
reputation
.
And
ever
,
after
such
an
outpouring
,
oh
,
what
a
*NL*
relief
have
I
witnessed
in
those
sinful
brethren
!
even
as
in
one
*NL*
who
at
last
draws
free
air
,
after
a
long
stifling
with
his
own
*NL*
polluted
breath
.
How
can
it
be
otherwise
?
Why
should
a
wretched
*NL*
man
--
guilty
,
we
will
say
,
of
murder
--
prefer
to
keep
the
dead
*NL*
corpse
buried
in
his
own
heart
,
rather
than
fling
it
forth
at
*NL*
once
,
and
let
the
universe
take
care
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
some
men
bury
their
secrets
thus
,
''
observed
the
calm
*NL*
physician
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
;
there
are
such
men
,
''
answered
Mr.
Dimmesdale
.
``
But
not
*NL*
to
suggest
more
obvious
reasons
,
it
may
be
that
they
are
kept
*NL*
silent
by
the
very
constitution
of
their
nature
.
Or
--
can
we
not
*NL*
suppose
it
?
--
guilty
as
they
may
be
,
retaining
,
nevertheless
,
a
*NL*
zeal
for
God
's
glory
and
man
's
welfare
,
they
shrink
from
*NL*
displaying
themselves
black
and
filthy
in
the
view
of
men
;
*NL*
because
,
thenceforward
,
no
good
can
be
achieved
by
them
;
no
evil
*NL*
of
the
past
be
redeemed
by
better
service
.
So
,
to
their
own
*NL*
unutterable
torment
,
they
go
about
among
their
fellow-creatures
,
*NL*
looking
pure
as
new-fallen
snow
,
while
their
hearts
are
all
*NL*
speckled
and
spotted
with
iniquity
of
which
they
can
not
rid
*NL*
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
men
deceive
themselves
,
''
said
Roger
Chillingworth
,
with
*NL*
somewhat
more
emphasis
than
usual
,
and
making
a
slight
gesture
*NL*
with
his
forefinger
.
``
They
fear
to
take
up
the
shame
that
*NL*
rightfully
belongs
to
them
.
Their
love
for
man
,
their
zeal
for
*NL*
God
's
service
--
these
holy
impulses
may
or
may
not
coexist
in
*NL*
their
hearts
with
the
evil
inmates
to
which
their
guilt
has
*NL*
unbarred
the
door
,
and
which
must
needs
propagate
a
hellish
*NL*
breed
within
them
.
But
,
if
they
seek
to
glorify
God
,
let
them
*NL*
not
lift
heavenward
their
unclean
hands
!
If
they
would
serve
*NL*
their
fellowmen
,
let
them
do
it
by
making
manifest
the
power
and
*NL*
reality
of
conscience
,
in
constraining
them
to
penitential
*NL*
self-abasement
!
Would
thou
have
me
to
believe
,
O
wise
and
pious
*NL*
friend
,
that
a
false
show
can
be
better
--
can
be
more
for
God
's
*NL*
glory
,
or
man
'
welfare
--
than
God
's
own
truth
?
Trust
me
,
such
men
*NL*
deceive
themselves
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
so
,
''
said
the
young
clergyman
,
indifferently
,
as
*NL*
waiving
a
discussion
that
he
considered
irrelevant
or
*NL*
unseasonable
.
He
had
a
ready
faculty
,
indeed
,
of
escaping
from
*NL*
any
topic
that
agitated
his
too
sensitive
and
nervous
*NL*
temperament
.
--
``
But
,
now
,
I
would
ask
of
my
well-skilled
*NL*
physician
,
whether
,
in
good
sooth
,
he
deems
me
to
have
profited
*NL*
by
his
kindly
care
of
this
weak
frame
of
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Roger
Chillingworth
could
answer
,
they
heard
the
clear
,
*NL*
wild
laughter
of
a
young
child
's
voice
,
proceeding
from
the
*NL*
adjacent
burial-ground
.
Looking
instinctively
from
the
open
*NL*
window
--
for
it
was
summer-time
--
the
minister
beheld
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
and
little
Pearl
passing
along
the
footpath
that
*NL*
traversed
the
enclosure
.
Pearl
looked
as
beautiful
as
the
day
,
*NL*
but
was
in
one
of
those
moods
of
perverse
merriment
which
,
*NL*
whenever
they
occurred
,
seemed
to
remove
her
entirely
out
of
the
*NL*
sphere
of
sympathy
or
human
contact
.
She
now
skipped
*NL*
irreverently
from
one
grave
to
another
;
until
coming
to
the
*NL*
broad
,
flat
,
armorial
tombstone
of
a
departed
worthy
--
perhaps
of
*NL*
Isaac
Johnson
himself
--
she
began
to
dance
upon
it
.
In
reply
to
*NL*
her
mother
's
command
and
entreaty
that
she
would
behave
more
*NL*
decorously
,
little
Pearl
paused
to
gather
the
prickly
burrs
from
*NL*
a
tall
burdock
which
grew
beside
the
tomb
.
Taking
a
handful
of
*NL*
these
,
she
arranged
them
along
the
lines
of
the
scarlet
letter
*NL*
that
decorated
the
maternal
bosom
,
to
which
the
burrs
,
as
their
*NL*
nature
was
,
tenaciously
adhered
.
Hester
did
not
pluck
them
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Roger
Chillingworth
had
by
this
time
approached
the
window
and
*NL*
smiled
grimly
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
law
,
nor
reverence
for
authority
,
no
regard
for
*NL*
human
ordinances
or
opinions
,
right
or
wrong
,
mixed
up
with
that
*NL*
child
's
composition
,
''
remarked
he
,
as
much
to
himself
as
to
his
*NL*
companion
.
``
I
saw
her
,
the
other
day
,
bespatter
the
Governor
*NL*
himself
with
water
at
the
cattle-trough
in
Spring
Lane
.
What
,
in
*NL*
heaven
's
name
,
is
she
?
Is
the
imp
altogether
evil
?
Hath
she
*NL*
affections
?
Hath
she
any
discoverable
principle
of
being
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
,
save
the
freedom
of
a
broken
law
,
''
answered
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
,
in
a
quiet
way
,
as
if
he
had
been
discussing
the
*NL*
point
within
himself
,
``
Whether
capable
of
good
,
I
know
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
probably
overheard
their
voices
,
for
,
looking
up
to
*NL*
the
window
with
a
bright
,
but
naughty
smile
of
mirth
and
*NL*
intelligence
,
she
threw
one
of
the
prickly
burrs
at
the
Rev.
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
.
The
sensitive
clergyman
shrank
,
with
nervous
dread
,
*NL*
from
the
light
missile
.
Detecting
his
emotion
,
Pearl
clapped
her
*NL*
little
hands
in
the
most
extravagant
ecstacy
.
Hester
Prynne
,
*NL*
likewise
,
had
involuntarily
looked
up
,
and
all
these
four
*NL*
persons
,
old
and
young
,
regarded
one
another
in
silence
,
till
*NL*
the
child
laughed
aloud
,
and
shouted
--
``
Come
away
,
mother
!
Come
*NL*
away
,
or
yonder
old
black
man
will
catch
you
!
He
hath
got
hold
*NL*
of
the
minister
already
.
Come
away
,
mother
or
he
will
catch
you
!
*NL*
But
he
can
not
catch
little
Pearl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
drew
her
mother
away
,
skipping
,
dancing
,
and
frisking
*NL*
fantastically
among
the
hillocks
of
the
dead
people
,
like
a
*NL*
creature
that
had
nothing
in
common
with
a
bygone
and
buried
*NL*
generation
,
nor
owned
herself
akin
to
it
.
It
was
as
if
she
had
*NL*
been
made
afresh
out
of
new
elements
,
and
must
perforce
be
*NL*
permitted
to
live
her
own
life
,
and
be
a
law
unto
herself
*NL*
without
her
eccentricities
being
reckoned
to
her
for
a
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
goes
a
woman
,
''
resumed
Roger
Chillingworth
,
after
a
*NL*
pause
,
``
who
,
be
her
demerits
what
they
may
,
hath
none
of
that
*NL*
mystery
of
hidden
sinfulness
which
you
deem
so
grievous
to
be
*NL*
borne
.
Is
Hester
Prynne
the
less
miserable
,
think
you
,
for
that
*NL*
scarlet
letter
on
her
breast
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
verily
believe
it
,
''
answered
the
clergyman
.
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
I
can
not
answer
for
her
.
There
was
a
look
of
pain
*NL*
in
her
face
which
I
would
gladly
have
been
spared
the
sight
of
.
*NL*
But
still
,
methinks
,
it
must
needs
be
better
for
the
sufferer
to
*NL*
be
free
to
show
his
pain
,
as
this
poor
woman
Hester
is
,
than
to
*NL*
cover
it
up
in
his
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
pause
,
and
the
physician
began
anew
to
examine
*NL*
and
arrange
the
plants
which
he
had
gathered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
inquired
of
me
,
a
little
time
agone
,
''
said
he
,
at
length
,
*NL*
``
my
judgment
as
touching
your
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
,
''
answered
the
clergyman
,
``
and
would
gladly
learn
it
.
*NL*
Speak
frankly
,
I
pray
you
,
be
it
for
life
or
death

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Freely
then
,
and
plainly
,
''
said
the
physician
,
still
busy
with
*NL*
his
plants
,
but
keeping
a
wary
eye
on
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
``
the
*NL*
disorder
is
a
strange
one
;
not
so
much
in
itself
nor
as
*NL*
outwardly
manifested
,
--
in
so
far
,
at
least
as
the
symptoms
have
*NL*
been
laid
open
to
my
observation
.
Looking
daily
at
you
,
my
good
*NL*
sir
,
and
watching
the
tokens
of
your
aspect
now
for
months
gone
*NL*
by
,
I
should
deem
you
a
man
sore
sick
,
it
may
be
,
yet
not
so
*NL*
sick
but
that
an
instructed
and
watchful
physician
might
well
*NL*
hope
to
cure
you
.
But
I
know
not
what
to
say
,
the
disease
is
*NL*
what
I
seem
to
know
,
yet
know
it
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
in
riddles
,
learned
sir

''
said
the
pale
minister
,
*NL*
glancing
aside
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
to
speak
more
plainly
,
''
continued
the
physician
,
``
and
I
*NL*
crave
pardon
,
sir
,
should
it
seem
to
require
pardon
,
for
this
*NL*
needful
plainness
of
my
speech
.
Let
me
ask
as
your
friend
,
as
*NL*
one
having
charge
,
under
Providence
,
of
your
life
and
physical
*NL*
well
being
,
hath
all
the
operations
of
this
disorder
been
fairly
*NL*
laid
open
and
recounted
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
question
it
?
''
asked
the
minister
.
``
Surely
it
were
*NL*
child
's
play
to
call
in
a
physician
and
then
hide
the
sore
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
tell
me
,
then
,
that
I
know
all
?
''
said
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
,
deliberately
,
and
fixing
an
eye
,
bright
with
*NL*
intense
and
concentrated
intelligence
,
on
the
minister
's
face
.
*NL*
``
Be
it
so
!
But
again
!
He
to
whom
only
the
outward
and
physical
*NL*
evil
is
laid
open
,
knoweth
,
oftentimes
,
but
half
the
evil
which
*NL*
he
is
called
upon
to
cure
.
A
bodily
disease
,
which
we
look
upon
*NL*
as
whole
and
entire
within
itself
,
may
,
after
all
,
be
but
a
*NL*
symptom
of
some
ailment
in
the
spiritual
part
.
Your
pardon
once
*NL*
again
,
good
sir
,
if
my
speech
give
the
shadow
of
offence
.
You
,
*NL*
sir
,
of
all
men
whom
I
have
known
,
are
he
whose
body
is
the
*NL*
closest
conjoined
,
and
imbued
,
and
identified
,
so
to
speak
,
with
*NL*
the
spirit
whereof
it
is
the
instrument
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
need
ask
no
further
,
''
said
the
clergyman
,
somewhat
*NL*
hastily
rising
from
his
chair
.
``
You
deal
not
,
I
take
it
,
in
*NL*
medicine
for
the
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
,
a
sickness
,
''
continued
Roger
Chillingworth
,
going
on
,
in
*NL*
an
unaltered
tone
,
without
heeding
the
interruption
,
but
*NL*
standing
up
and
confronting
the
emaciated
and
white-cheeked
*NL*
minister
,
with
his
low
,
dark
,
and
misshapen
figure
,
--
``
a
*NL*
sickness
,
a
sore
place
,
if
we
may
so
call
it
,
in
your
spirit
*NL*
hath
immediately
its
appropriate
manifestation
in
your
bodily
*NL*
frame
.
Would
you
,
therefore
,
that
your
physician
heal
the
bodily
*NL*
evil
?
How
may
this
be
unless
you
first
lay
open
to
him
the
wound
*NL*
or
trouble
in
your
soul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
to
thee
!
not
to
an
earthly
physician
!
''
cried
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
,
passionately
,
and
turning
his
eyes
,
full
and
bright
,
*NL*
and
with
a
kind
of
fierceness
,
on
old
Roger
Chillingworth
.
``
Not
*NL*
to
thee
!
But
,
if
it
be
the
soul
's
disease
,
then
do
I
commit
*NL*
myself
to
the
one
Physician
of
the
soul
!
He
,
if
it
stand
with
*NL*
His
good
pleasure
,
can
cure
,
or
he
can
kill
.
Let
Him
do
with
me
*NL*
as
,
in
His
justice
and
wisdom
,
He
shall
see
good
.
But
who
art
*NL*
thou
,
that
meddlest
in
this
matter
?
that
dares
thrust
himself
*NL*
between
the
sufferer
and
his
God
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
frantic
gesture
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
as
well
to
have
made
this
step
,
''
said
Roger
Chillingworth
*NL*
to
himself
,
looking
after
the
minister
,
with
a
grave
smile
.
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
lost
.
We
shall
be
friends
again
anon
.
But
see
,
*NL*
now
,
how
passion
takes
hold
upon
this
man
,
and
hurrieth
him
out
*NL*
of
himself
!
As
with
one
passion
so
with
another
.
He
hath
done
a
*NL*
wild
thing
ere
now
,
this
pious
Master
Dimmesdale
,
in
the
hot
*NL*
passion
of
his
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
proved
not
difficult
to
re-establish
the
intimacy
of
the
two
*NL*
companions
,
on
the
same
footing
and
in
the
same
degree
as
*NL*
heretofore
.
The
young
clergyman
,
after
a
few
hours
of
privacy
,
*NL*
was
sensible
that
the
disorder
of
his
nerves
had
hurried
him
*NL*
into
an
unseemly
outbreak
of
temper
,
which
there
had
been
*NL*
nothing
in
the
physician
's
words
to
excuse
or
palliate
.
He
*NL*
marvelled
,
indeed
,
at
the
violence
with
which
he
had
thrust
back
*NL*
the
kind
old
man
,
when
merely
proffering
the
advice
which
it
was
*NL*
his
duty
to
bestow
,
and
which
the
minister
himself
had
expressly
*NL*
sought
.
With
these
remorseful
feelings
,
he
lost
no
time
in
*NL*
making
the
amplest
apologies
,
and
besought
his
friend
still
to
*NL*
continue
the
care
which
,
if
not
successful
in
restoring
him
to
*NL*
health
,
had
,
in
all
probability
,
been
the
means
of
prolonging
*NL*
his
feeble
existence
to
that
hour
.
Roger
Chillingworth
readily
*NL*
assented
,
and
went
on
with
his
medical
supervision
of
the
*NL*
minister
;
doing
his
best
for
him
,
in
all
good
faith
,
but
always
*NL*
quitting
the
patient
's
apartment
,
at
the
close
of
the
*NL*
professional
interview
,
with
a
mysterious
and
puzzled
smile
upon
*NL*
his
lips
.
This
expression
was
invisible
in
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
*NL*
presence
,
but
grew
strongly
evident
as
the
physician
crossed
the
*NL*
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
rare
case
,
''
he
muttered
.
``
I
must
needs
look
deeper
into
it
.
*NL*
A
strange
sympathy
betwixt
soul
and
body
!
Were
it
only
for
the
*NL*
art
's
sake
,
I
must
search
this
matter
to
the
bottom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
to
pass
,
not
long
after
the
scene
above
recorded
,
that
*NL*
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
noon-day
,
and
entirely
unawares
,
*NL*
fell
into
a
deep
,
deep
slumber
,
sitting
in
his
chair
,
with
a
*NL*
large
black-letter
volume
open
before
him
on
the
table
.
It
must
*NL*
have
been
a
work
of
vast
ability
in
the
somniferous
school
of
*NL*
literature
.
The
profound
depth
of
the
minister
's
repose
was
the
*NL*
more
remarkable
,
inasmuch
as
he
was
one
of
those
persons
whose
*NL*
sleep
ordinarily
is
as
light
as
fitful
,
and
as
easily
scared
*NL*
away
,
as
a
small
bird
hopping
on
a
twig
.
To
such
an
unwonted
*NL*
remoteness
,
however
,
had
his
spirit
now
withdrawn
into
itself
*NL*
that
he
stirred
not
in
his
chair
when
old
Roger
Chillingworth
,
*NL*
without
any
extraordinary
precaution
,
came
into
the
room
.
The
*NL*
physician
advanced
directly
in
front
of
his
patient
,
laid
his
*NL*
hand
upon
his
bosom
,
and
thrust
aside
the
vestment
,
that
*NL*
hitherto
had
always
covered
it
even
from
the
professional
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Dimmesdale
shuddered
,
and
slightly
stirred
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
brief
pause
,
the
physician
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
with
what
a
wild
look
of
wonder
,
joy
,
and
horror
!
With
what
*NL*
a
ghastly
rapture
,
as
it
were
,
too
mighty
to
be
expressed
only
*NL*
by
the
eye
and
features
,
and
therefore
bursting
forth
through
*NL*
the
whole
ugliness
of
his
figure
,
and
making
itself
even
*NL*
riotously
manifest
by
the
extravagant
gestures
with
which
he
*NL*
threw
up
his
arms
towards
the
ceiling
,
and
stamped
his
foot
upon
*NL*
the
floor
!
Had
a
man
seen
old
Roger
Chillingworth
,
at
that
*NL*
moment
of
his
ecstasy
,
he
would
have
had
no
need
to
ask
how
*NL*
Satan
comports
himself
when
a
precious
human
soul
is
lost
to
*NL*
heaven
,
and
won
into
his
kingdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
distinguished
the
physician
's
ecstasy
from
Satan
's
was
*NL*
the
trait
of
wonder
in
it
!
*NL*

XI
.
THE
INTERIOR
OF
A
HEART
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
incident
last
described
,
the
intercourse
between
the
*NL*
clergyman
and
the
physician
,
though
externally
the
same
,
was
*NL*
really
of
another
character
than
it
had
previously
been
.
The
*NL*
intellect
of
Roger
Chillingworth
had
now
a
sufficiently
plain
*NL*
path
before
it
.
It
was
not
,
indeed
,
precisely
that
which
he
had
*NL*
laid
out
for
himself
to
tread
.
Calm
,
gentle
,
passionless
,
as
he
*NL*
appeared
,
there
was
yet
,
we
fear
,
a
quiet
depth
of
malice
,
*NL*
hitherto
latent
,
but
active
now
,
in
this
unfortunate
old
man
,
*NL*
which
led
him
to
imagine
a
more
intimate
revenge
than
any
mortal
*NL*
had
ever
wreaked
upon
an
enemy
.
To
make
himself
the
one
trusted
*NL*
friend
,
to
whom
should
be
confided
all
the
fear
,
the
remorse
,
*NL*
the
agony
,
the
ineffectual
repentance
,
the
backward
rush
of
*NL*
sinful
thoughts
,
expelled
in
vain
!
All
that
guilty
sorrow
,
*NL*
hidden
from
the
world
,
whose
great
heart
would
have
pitied
and
*NL*
forgiven
,
to
be
revealed
to
him
,
the
Pitiless
--
to
him
,
the
*NL*
Unforgiving
!
All
that
dark
treasure
to
be
lavished
on
the
very
*NL*
man
,
to
whom
nothing
else
could
so
adequately
pay
the
debt
of
*NL*
vengeance
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
clergyman
's
shy
and
sensitive
reserve
had
balked
this
*NL*
scheme
.
Roger
Chillingworth
,
however
,
was
inclined
to
be
hardly
,
*NL*
if
at
all
,
less
satisfied
with
the
aspect
of
affairs
,
which
*NL*
Providence
--
using
the
avenger
and
his
victim
for
its
own
*NL*
purposes
,
and
,
perchance
,
pardoning
,
where
it
seemed
most
to
*NL*
punish
--
had
substituted
for
his
black
devices
.
A
revelation
,
he
*NL*
could
almost
say
,
had
been
granted
to
him
.
It
mattered
little
*NL*
for
his
object
,
whether
celestial
or
from
what
other
region
.
By
*NL*
its
aid
,
in
all
the
subsequent
relations
betwixt
him
and
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
,
not
merely
the
external
presence
,
but
the
very
*NL*
inmost
soul
of
the
latter
,
seemed
to
be
brought
out
before
his
*NL*
eyes
,
so
that
he
could
see
and
comprehend
its
every
movement
.
He
*NL*
became
,
thenceforth
,
not
a
spectator
only
,
but
a
chief
actor
in
*NL*
the
poor
minister
's
interior
world
.
He
could
play
upon
him
as
he
*NL*
chose
.
Would
he
arouse
him
with
a
throb
of
agony
?
The
victim
was
*NL*
for
ever
on
the
rack
;
it
needed
only
to
know
the
spring
that
*NL*
controlled
the
engine
:
and
the
physician
knew
it
well
.
Would
he
*NL*
startle
him
with
sudden
fear
?
As
at
the
waving
of
a
magician
's
*NL*
wand
,
up
rose
a
grisly
phantom
--
up
rose
a
thousand
phantoms
--
in
*NL*
many
shapes
,
of
death
,
or
more
awful
shame
,
all
flocking
round
*NL*
about
the
clergyman
,
and
pointing
with
their
fingers
at
his
*NL*
breast
!
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
accomplished
with
a
subtlety
so
perfect
,
that
the
*NL*
minister
,
though
he
had
constantly
a
dim
perception
of
some
evil
*NL*
influence
watching
over
him
,
could
never
gain
a
knowledge
of
its
*NL*
actual
nature
.
True
,
he
looked
doubtfully
,
fearfully
--
even
,
at
*NL*
times
,
with
horror
and
the
bitterness
of
hatred
--
at
the
deformed
*NL*
figure
of
the
old
physician
.
His
gestures
,
his
gait
,
his
*NL*
grizzled
beard
,
his
slightest
and
most
indifferent
acts
,
the
*NL*
very
fashion
of
his
garments
,
were
odious
in
the
clergyman
's
*NL*
sight
;
a
token
implicitly
to
be
relied
on
of
a
deeper
antipathy
*NL*
in
the
breast
of
the
latter
than
he
was
willing
to
acknowledge
*NL*
to
himself
.
For
,
as
it
was
impossible
to
assign
a
reason
for
*NL*
such
distrust
and
abhorrence
,
so
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
conscious
that
*NL*
the
poison
of
one
morbid
spot
was
infecting
his
heart
's
entire
*NL*
substance
,
attributed
all
his
presentiments
to
no
other
cause
.
*NL*
He
took
himself
to
task
for
his
bad
sympathies
in
reference
to
*NL*
Roger
Chillingworth
,
disregarded
the
lesson
that
he
should
have
*NL*
drawn
from
them
,
and
did
his
best
to
root
them
out
.
Unable
to
*NL*
accomplish
this
,
he
nevertheless
,
as
a
matter
of
principle
,
*NL*
continued
his
habits
of
social
familiarity
with
the
old
man
,
and
*NL*
thus
gave
him
constant
opportunities
for
perfecting
the
purpose
*NL*
to
which
--
poor
forlorn
creature
that
he
was
,
and
more
wretched
*NL*
than
his
victim
--
the
avenger
had
devoted
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
thus
suffering
under
bodily
disease
,
and
gnawed
and
*NL*
tortured
by
some
black
trouble
of
the
soul
,
and
given
over
to
*NL*
the
machinations
of
his
deadliest
enemy
,
the
Reverend
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
had
achieved
a
brilliant
popularity
in
his
sacred
*NL*
office
.
He
won
it
indeed
,
in
great
part
,
by
his
sorrows
.
His
*NL*
intellectual
gifts
,
his
moral
perceptions
,
his
power
of
*NL*
experiencing
and
communicating
emotion
,
were
kept
in
a
state
of
*NL*
preternatural
activity
by
the
prick
and
anguish
of
his
daily
*NL*
life
.
His
fame
,
though
still
on
its
upward
slope
,
already
*NL*
overshadowed
the
soberer
reputations
of
his
fellow-clergymen
,
*NL*
eminent
as
several
of
them
were
.
There
are
scholars
among
them
,
*NL*
who
had
spent
more
years
in
acquiring
abstruse
lore
,
connected
*NL*
with
the
divine
profession
,
than
Mr.
Dimmesdale
had
lived
;
and
*NL*
who
might
well
,
therefore
,
be
more
profoundly
versed
in
such
*NL*
solid
and
valuable
attainments
than
their
youthful
brother
.
*NL*
There
were
men
,
too
,
of
a
sturdier
texture
of
mind
than
his
,
and
*NL*
endowed
with
a
far
greater
share
of
shrewd
,
hard
iron
,
or
*NL*
granite
understanding
;
which
,
duly
mingled
with
a
fair
*NL*
proportion
of
doctrinal
ingredient
,
constitutes
a
highly
*NL*
respectable
,
efficacious
,
and
unamiable
variety
of
the
clerical
*NL*
species
.
There
were
others
again
,
true
saintly
fathers
,
whose
*NL*
faculties
had
been
elaborated
by
weary
toil
among
their
books
,
*NL*
and
by
patient
thought
,
and
etherealised
,
moreover
,
by
spiritual
*NL*
communications
with
the
better
world
,
into
which
their
purity
of
*NL*
life
had
almost
introduced
these
holy
personages
,
with
their
*NL*
garments
of
mortality
still
clinging
to
them
.
All
that
they
*NL*
lacked
was
,
the
gift
that
descended
upon
the
chosen
disciples
at
*NL*
Pentecost
,
in
tongues
of
flame
;
symbolising
,
it
would
seem
,
not
*NL*
the
power
of
speech
in
foreign
and
unknown
languages
,
but
that
*NL*
of
addressing
the
whole
human
brotherhood
in
the
heart
's
native
*NL*
language
.
These
fathers
,
otherwise
so
apostolic
,
lacked
Heaven
's
*NL*
last
and
rarest
attestation
of
their
office
,
the
Tongue
of
*NL*
Flame
.
They
would
have
vainly
sought
--
had
they
ever
dreamed
of
*NL*
seeking
--
to
express
the
highest
truths
through
the
humblest
*NL*
medium
of
familiar
words
and
images
.
Their
voices
came
down
,
*NL*
afar
and
indistinctly
,
from
the
upper
heights
where
they
*NL*
habitually
dwelt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
improbably
,
it
was
to
this
latter
class
of
men
that
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
,
by
many
of
his
traits
of
character
,
naturally
*NL*
belonged
.
To
the
high
mountain
peaks
of
faith
and
sanctity
he
*NL*
would
have
climbed
,
had
not
the
tendency
been
thwarted
by
the
*NL*
burden
,
whatever
it
might
be
,
of
crime
or
anguish
,
beneath
which
*NL*
it
was
his
doom
to
totter
.
It
kept
him
down
on
a
level
with
the
*NL*
lowest
;
him
,
the
man
of
ethereal
attributes
,
whose
voice
the
*NL*
angels
might
else
have
listened
to
and
answered
!
But
this
very
*NL*
burden
it
was
that
gave
him
sympathies
so
intimate
with
the
*NL*
sinful
brotherhood
of
mankind
;
so
that
his
heart
vibrated
in
*NL*
unison
with
theirs
,
and
received
their
pain
into
itself
and
sent
*NL*
its
own
throb
of
pain
through
a
thousand
other
hearts
,
in
gushes
*NL*
of
sad
,
persuasive
eloquence
.
Oftenest
persuasive
,
but
sometimes
*NL*
terrible
!
The
people
knew
not
the
power
that
moved
them
thus
.
*NL*
They
deemed
the
young
clergyman
a
miracle
of
holiness
.
They
*NL*
fancied
him
the
mouth-piece
of
Heaven
's
messages
of
wisdom
,
and
*NL*
rebuke
,
and
love
.
In
their
eyes
,
the
very
ground
on
which
he
*NL*
trod
was
sanctified
.
The
virgins
of
his
church
grew
pale
around
*NL*
him
,
victims
of
a
passion
so
imbued
with
religious
sentiment
,
*NL*
that
they
imagined
it
to
be
all
religion
,
and
brought
it
openly
,
*NL*
in
their
white
bosoms
,
as
their
most
acceptable
sacrifice
before
*NL*
the
altar
.
The
aged
members
of
his
flock
,
beholding
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
's
frame
so
feeble
,
while
they
were
themselves
so
*NL*
rugged
in
their
infirmity
,
believed
that
he
would
go
heavenward
*NL*
before
them
,
and
enjoined
it
upon
their
children
that
their
old
*NL*
bones
should
be
buried
close
to
their
young
pastor
's
holy
grave
.
*NL*
And
all
this
time
,
perchance
,
when
poor
Mr.
Dimmesdale
was
*NL*
thinking
of
his
grave
,
he
questioned
with
himself
whether
the
*NL*
grass
would
ever
grow
on
it
,
because
an
accursed
thing
must
*NL*
there
be
buried
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
inconceivable
,
the
agony
with
which
this
public
veneration
*NL*
tortured
him
.
It
was
his
genuine
impulse
to
adore
the
truth
,
and
*NL*
to
reckon
all
things
shadow-like
,
and
utterly
devoid
of
weight
*NL*
or
value
,
that
had
not
its
divine
essence
as
the
life
within
*NL*
their
life
.
Then
what
was
he
?
--
a
substance
?
--
or
the
dimmest
of
*NL*
all
shadows
?
He
longed
to
speak
out
from
his
own
pulpit
at
the
*NL*
full
height
of
his
voice
,
and
tell
the
people
what
he
was
.
``
I
,
*NL*
whom
you
behold
in
these
black
garments
of
the
priesthood
--
I
,
*NL*
who
ascend
the
sacred
desk
,
and
turn
my
pale
face
heavenward
,
*NL*
taking
upon
myself
to
hold
communion
in
your
behalf
with
the
*NL*
Most
High
Omniscience
--
I
,
in
whose
daily
life
you
discern
the
*NL*
sanctity
of
Enoch
--
I
,
whose
footsteps
,
as
you
suppose
,
leave
a
*NL*
gleam
along
my
earthly
track
,
whereby
the
Pilgrims
that
shall
*NL*
come
after
me
may
be
guided
to
the
regions
of
the
blest
--
I
,
who
*NL*
have
laid
the
hand
of
baptism
upon
your
children
--
I
,
who
have
*NL*
breathed
the
parting
prayer
over
your
dying
friends
,
to
whom
the
*NL*
Amen
sounded
faintly
from
a
world
which
they
had
quitted
--
I
,
*NL*
your
pastor
,
whom
you
so
reverence
and
trust
,
am
utterly
a
*NL*
pollution
and
a
lie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
once
,
Mr.
Dimmesdale
had
gone
into
the
pulpit
,
with
a
*NL*
purpose
never
to
come
down
its
steps
until
he
should
have
spoken
*NL*
words
like
the
above
.
More
than
once
he
had
cleared
his
throat
,
*NL*
and
drawn
in
the
long
,
deep
,
and
tremulous
breath
,
which
,
when
*NL*
sent
forth
again
,
would
come
burdened
with
the
black
secret
of
*NL*
his
soul
.
More
than
once
--
nay
,
more
than
a
hundred
times
--
he
had
*NL*
actually
spoken
!
Spoken
!
But
how
?
He
had
told
his
hearers
that
*NL*
he
was
altogether
vile
,
a
viler
companion
of
the
vilest
,
the
*NL*
worst
of
sinners
,
an
abomination
,
a
thing
of
unimaginable
*NL*
iniquity
,
and
that
the
only
wonder
was
that
they
did
not
see
his
*NL*
wretched
body
shrivelled
up
before
their
eyes
by
the
burning
*NL*
wrath
of
the
Almighty
!
Could
there
be
plainer
speech
than
this
?
*NL*
Would
not
the
people
start
up
in
their
seats
,
by
a
simultaneous
*NL*
impulse
,
and
tear
him
down
out
of
the
pulpit
which
he
defiled
?
*NL*
Not
so
,
indeed
!
They
heard
it
all
,
and
did
but
reverence
him
the
*NL*
more
.
They
little
guessed
what
deadly
purport
lurked
in
those
*NL*
self-condemning
words
.
``
The
godly
youth
!
''
said
they
among
*NL*
themselves
.
``
The
saint
on
earth
!
Alas
!
if
he
discern
such
*NL*
sinfulness
in
his
own
white
soul
,
what
horrid
spectacle
would
he
*NL*
behold
in
thine
or
mine
!
''
The
minister
well
knew
--
subtle
,
but
*NL*
remorseful
hypocrite
that
he
was
!
--
the
light
in
which
his
vague
*NL*
confession
would
be
viewed
.
He
had
striven
to
put
a
cheat
upon
*NL*
himself
by
making
the
avowal
of
a
guilty
conscience
,
but
had
*NL*
gained
only
one
other
sin
,
and
a
self-acknowledged
shame
,
*NL*
without
the
momentary
relief
of
being
self-deceived
.
He
had
*NL*
spoken
the
very
truth
,
and
transformed
it
into
the
veriest
*NL*
falsehood
.
And
yet
,
by
the
constitution
of
his
nature
,
he
loved
*NL*
the
truth
,
and
loathed
the
lie
,
as
few
men
ever
did
.
Therefore
,
*NL*
above
all
things
else
,
he
loathed
his
miserable
self
!
*NL*
*NL*
His
inward
trouble
drove
him
to
practices
more
in
accordance
*NL*
with
the
old
,
corrupted
faith
of
Rome
than
with
the
better
light
*NL*
of
the
church
in
which
he
had
been
born
and
bred
.
In
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
's
secret
closet
,
under
lock
and
key
,
there
was
a
*NL*
bloody
scourge
.
Oftentimes
,
this
Protestant
and
Puritan
divine
*NL*
had
plied
it
on
his
own
shoulders
,
laughing
bitterly
at
himself
*NL*
the
while
,
and
smiting
so
much
the
more
pitilessly
because
of
*NL*
that
bitter
laugh
.
It
was
his
custom
,
too
,
as
it
has
been
that
*NL*
of
many
other
pious
Puritans
,
to
fast
--
not
however
,
like
them
,
*NL*
in
order
to
purify
the
body
,
and
render
it
the
fitter
medium
of
*NL*
celestial
illumination
--
but
rigorously
,
and
until
his
knees
*NL*
trembled
beneath
him
,
as
an
act
of
penance
.
He
kept
vigils
,
*NL*
likewise
,
night
after
night
,
sometimes
in
utter
darkness
,
*NL*
sometimes
with
a
glimmering
lamp
,
and
sometimes
,
viewing
his
own
*NL*
face
in
a
looking-glass
,
by
the
most
powerful
light
which
he
*NL*
could
throw
upon
it
.
He
thus
typified
the
constant
introspection
*NL*
wherewith
he
tortured
,
but
could
not
purify
himself
.
In
these
*NL*
lengthened
vigils
,
his
brain
often
reeled
,
and
visions
seemed
to
*NL*
flit
before
him
;
perhaps
seen
doubtfully
,
and
by
a
faint
light
*NL*
of
their
own
,
in
the
remote
dimness
of
the
chamber
,
or
more
*NL*
vividly
and
close
beside
him
,
within
the
looking-glass
.
Now
it
*NL*
was
a
herd
of
diabolic
shapes
,
that
grinned
and
mocked
at
the
*NL*
pale
minister
,
and
beckoned
him
away
with
them
;
now
a
group
of
*NL*
shining
angels
,
who
flew
upward
heavily
,
as
sorrow-laden
,
but
*NL*
grew
more
ethereal
as
they
rose
.
Now
came
the
dead
friends
of
*NL*
his
youth
,
and
his
white-bearded
father
,
with
a
saint-like
*NL*
frown
,
and
his
mother
turning
her
face
away
as
she
passed
by
.
*NL*
Ghost
of
a
mother
--
thinnest
fantasy
of
a
mother
--
methinks
she
*NL*
might
yet
have
thrown
a
pitying
glance
towards
her
son
!
And
now
,
*NL*
through
the
chamber
which
these
spectral
thoughts
had
made
so
*NL*
ghastly
,
glided
Hester
Prynne
leading
along
little
Pearl
,
in
her
*NL*
scarlet
garb
,
and
pointing
her
forefinger
,
first
at
the
scarlet
*NL*
letter
on
her
bosom
,
and
then
at
the
clergyman
's
own
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
these
visions
ever
quite
deluded
him
.
At
any
moment
,
by
*NL*
an
effort
of
his
will
,
he
could
discern
substances
through
their
*NL*
misty
lack
of
substance
,
and
convince
himself
that
they
were
not
*NL*
solid
in
their
nature
,
like
yonder
table
of
carved
oak
,
or
that
*NL*
big
,
square
,
leather-bound
and
brazen-clasped
volume
of
*NL*
divinity
.
But
,
for
all
that
,
they
were
,
in
one
sense
,
the
truest
*NL*
and
most
substantial
things
which
the
poor
minister
now
dealt
*NL*
with
.
It
is
the
unspeakable
misery
of
a
life
so
false
as
his
,
*NL*
that
it
steals
the
pith
and
substance
out
of
whatever
realities
*NL*
there
are
around
us
,
and
which
were
meant
by
Heaven
to
be
the
*NL*
spirit
's
joy
and
nutriment
.
To
the
untrue
man
,
the
whole
*NL*
universe
is
false
--
it
is
impalpable
--
it
shrinks
to
nothing
*NL*
within
his
grasp
.
And
he
himself
in
so
far
as
he
shows
himself
*NL*
in
a
false
light
,
becomes
a
shadow
,
or
,
indeed
,
ceases
to
exist
.
*NL*
The
only
truth
that
continued
to
give
Mr.
Dimmesdale
a
real
*NL*
existence
on
this
earth
was
the
anguish
in
his
inmost
soul
,
and
*NL*
the
undissembled
expression
of
it
in
his
aspect
.
Had
he
once
*NL*
found
power
to
smile
,
and
wear
a
face
of
gaiety
,
there
would
*NL*
have
been
no
such
man
!
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
those
ugly
nights
,
which
we
have
faintly
hinted
at
,
*NL*
but
forborne
to
picture
forth
,
the
minister
started
from
his
*NL*
chair
.
A
new
thought
had
struck
him
.
There
might
be
a
moment
's
*NL*
peace
in
it
.
Attiring
himself
with
as
much
care
as
if
it
had
*NL*
been
for
public
worship
,
and
precisely
in
the
same
manner
,
he
*NL*
stole
softly
down
the
staircase
,
undid
the
door
,
and
issued
*NL*
forth
.

THE
MINISTER
'S
VIGIL
*NL*
*NL*
Walking
in
the
shadow
of
a
dream
,
as
it
were
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
actually
under
the
influence
of
a
species
of
somnambulism
,
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
reached
the
spot
where
,
now
so
long
since
,
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
had
lived
through
her
first
hours
of
public
ignominy
.
The
*NL*
same
platform
or
scaffold
,
black
and
weather-stained
with
the
*NL*
storm
or
sunshine
of
seven
long
years
,
and
foot-worn
,
too
,
with
*NL*
the
tread
of
many
culprits
who
had
since
ascended
it
,
remained
*NL*
standing
beneath
the
balcony
of
the
meeting-house
.
The
minister
*NL*
went
up
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
obscure
night
in
early
May
.
An
unvaried
pall
of
*NL*
cloud
muffled
the
whole
expanse
of
sky
from
zenith
to
horizon
.
*NL*
If
the
same
multitude
which
had
stood
as
eye-witnesses
while
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
sustained
her
punishment
could
now
have
been
*NL*
summoned
forth
,
they
would
have
discerned
no
face
above
the
*NL*
platform
nor
hardly
the
outline
of
a
human
shape
,
in
the
dark
*NL*
grey
of
the
midnight
.
But
the
town
was
all
asleep
.
There
was
no
*NL*
peril
of
discovery
.
The
minister
might
stand
there
,
if
it
so
*NL*
pleased
him
,
until
morning
should
redden
in
the
east
,
without
*NL*
other
risk
than
that
the
dank
and
chill
night
air
would
creep
*NL*
into
his
frame
,
and
stiffen
his
joints
with
rheumatism
,
and
clog
*NL*
his
throat
with
catarrh
and
cough
;
thereby
defrauding
the
*NL*
expectant
audience
of
to-morrow
's
prayer
and
sermon
.
No
eye
*NL*
could
see
him
,
save
that
ever-wakeful
one
which
had
seen
him
in
*NL*
his
closet
,
wielding
the
bloody
scourge
.
Why
,
then
,
had
he
come
*NL*
hither
?
Was
it
but
the
mockery
of
penitence
?
A
mockery
,
indeed
,
*NL*
but
in
which
his
soul
trifled
with
itself
!
A
mockery
at
which
*NL*
angels
blushed
and
wept
,
while
fiends
rejoiced
with
jeering
*NL*
laughter
!
He
had
been
driven
hither
by
the
impulse
of
that
*NL*
Remorse
which
dogged
him
everywhere
,
and
whose
own
sister
and
*NL*
closely
linked
companion
was
that
Cowardice
which
invariably
*NL*
drew
him
back
,
with
her
tremulous
gripe
,
just
when
the
other
*NL*
impulse
had
hurried
him
to
the
verge
of
a
disclosure
.
Poor
,
*NL*
miserable
man
!
what
right
had
infirmity
like
his
to
burden
*NL*
itself
with
crime
?
Crime
is
for
the
iron-nerved
,
who
have
their
*NL*
choice
either
to
endure
it
,
or
,
if
it
press
too
hard
,
to
exert
*NL*
their
fierce
and
savage
strength
for
a
good
purpose
,
and
fling
*NL*
it
off
at
once
!
This
feeble
and
most
sensitive
of
spirits
could
*NL*
do
neither
,
yet
continually
did
one
thing
or
another
,
which
*NL*
intertwined
,
in
the
same
inextricable
knot
,
the
agony
of
*NL*
heaven-defying
guilt
and
vain
repentance
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
thus
,
while
standing
on
the
scaffold
,
in
this
vain
show
of
*NL*
expiation
,
Mr.
Dimmesdale
was
overcome
with
a
great
horror
of
*NL*
mind
,
as
if
the
universe
were
gazing
at
a
scarlet
token
on
his
*NL*
naked
breast
,
right
over
his
heart
.
On
that
spot
,
in
very
truth
,
*NL*
there
was
,
and
there
had
long
been
,
the
gnawing
and
poisonous
*NL*
tooth
of
bodily
pain
.
Without
any
effort
of
his
will
,
or
power
*NL*
to
restrain
himself
,
he
shrieked
aloud
:
an
outcry
that
went
*NL*
pealing
through
the
night
,
and
was
beaten
back
from
one
house
to
*NL*
another
,
and
reverberated
from
the
hills
in
the
background
;
as
*NL*
if
a
company
of
devils
,
detecting
so
much
misery
and
terror
in
*NL*
it
,
had
made
a
plaything
of
the
sound
,
and
were
bandying
it
to
*NL*
and
fro
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
done
!
''
muttered
the
minister
,
covering
his
face
with
his
*NL*
hands
.
``
The
whole
town
will
awake
and
hurry
forth
,
and
find
me
*NL*
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
so
.
The
shriek
had
perhaps
sounded
with
a
far
*NL*
greater
power
,
to
his
own
startled
ears
,
than
it
actually
*NL*
possessed
.
The
town
did
not
awake
;
or
,
if
it
did
,
the
drowsy
*NL*
slumberers
mistook
the
cry
either
for
something
frightful
in
a
*NL*
dream
,
or
for
the
noise
of
witches
,
whose
voices
,
at
that
*NL*
period
,
were
often
heard
to
pass
over
the
settlements
or
lonely
*NL*
cottages
,
as
they
rode
with
Satan
through
the
air
.
The
*NL*
clergyman
,
therefore
,
hearing
no
symptoms
of
disturbance
,
*NL*
uncovered
his
eyes
and
looked
about
him
.
At
one
of
the
*NL*
chamber-windows
of
Governor
Bellingham
's
mansion
,
which
stood
at
*NL*
some
distance
,
on
the
line
of
another
street
,
he
beheld
the
*NL*
appearance
of
the
old
magistrate
himself
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
*NL*
a
white
night-cap
on
his
head
,
and
a
long
white
gown
enveloping
*NL*
his
figure
.
He
looked
like
a
ghost
evoked
unseasonably
from
the
*NL*
grave
.
The
cry
had
evidently
startled
him
.
At
another
window
of
*NL*
the
same
house
,
moreover
appeared
old
Mistress
Hibbins
,
the
*NL*
Governor
's
sister
,
also
with
a
lamp
,
which
even
thus
far
off
*NL*
revealed
the
expression
of
her
sour
and
discontented
face
.
She
*NL*
thrust
forth
her
head
from
the
lattice
,
and
looked
anxiously
*NL*
upward
.
Beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
,
this
venerable
witch-lady
*NL*
had
heard
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
outcry
,
and
interpreted
it
,
with
its
*NL*
multitudinous
echoes
and
reverberations
,
as
the
clamour
of
the
*NL*
fiends
and
night-hags
,
with
whom
she
was
well
known
to
make
*NL*
excursions
in
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Detecting
the
gleam
of
Governor
Bellingham
's
lamp
,
the
old
lady
*NL*
quickly
extinguished
her
own
,
and
vanished
.
Possibly
,
she
went
*NL*
up
among
the
clouds
.
The
minister
saw
nothing
further
of
her
*NL*
motions
.
The
magistrate
,
after
a
wary
observation
of
the
*NL*
darkness
--
into
which
,
nevertheless
,
he
could
see
but
little
*NL*
further
than
he
might
into
a
mill-stone
--
retired
from
the
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
grew
comparatively
calm
.
His
eyes
,
however
,
were
*NL*
soon
greeted
by
a
little
glimmering
light
,
which
,
at
first
a
*NL*
long
way
off
was
approaching
up
the
street
.
It
threw
a
gleam
of
*NL*
recognition
,
on
here
a
post
,
and
there
a
garden
fence
,
and
here
*NL*
a
latticed
window-pane
,
and
there
a
pump
,
with
its
full
trough
*NL*
of
water
,
and
here
again
an
arched
door
of
oak
,
with
an
iron
*NL*
knocker
,
and
a
rough
log
for
the
door-step
.
The
Reverend
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
noted
all
these
minute
particulars
,
even
while
firmly
*NL*
convinced
that
the
doom
of
his
existence
was
stealing
onward
,
in
*NL*
the
footsteps
which
he
now
heard
;
and
that
the
gleam
of
the
*NL*
lantern
would
fall
upon
him
in
a
few
moments
more
,
and
reveal
*NL*
his
long-hidden
secret
.
As
the
light
drew
nearer
,
he
beheld
,
*NL*
within
its
illuminated
circle
,
his
brother
clergyman
--
or
,
to
*NL*
speak
more
accurately
,
his
professional
father
,
as
well
as
*NL*
highly
valued
friend
--
the
Reverend
Mr.
Wilson
,
who
,
as
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
now
conjectured
,
had
been
praying
at
the
bedside
of
*NL*
some
dying
man
.
And
so
he
had
.
The
good
old
minister
came
*NL*
freshly
from
the
death-chamber
of
Governor
Winthrop
,
who
had
*NL*
passed
from
earth
to
heaven
within
that
very
hour
.
And
now
*NL*
surrounded
,
like
the
saint-like
personage
of
olden
times
,
with
a
*NL*
radiant
halo
,
that
glorified
him
amid
this
gloomy
night
of
*NL*
sin
--
as
if
the
departed
Governor
had
left
him
an
inheritance
of
*NL*
his
glory
,
or
as
if
he
had
caught
upon
himself
the
distant
shine
*NL*
of
the
celestial
city
,
while
looking
thitherward
to
see
the
*NL*
triumphant
pilgrim
pass
within
its
gates
--
now
,
in
short
,
good
*NL*
Father
Wilson
was
moving
homeward
,
aiding
his
footsteps
with
a
*NL*
lighted
lantern
!
The
glimmer
of
this
luminary
suggested
the
*NL*
above
conceits
to
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
who
smiled
--
nay
,
almost
*NL*
laughed
at
them
--
and
then
wondered
if
he
was
going
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Reverend
Mr.
Wilson
passed
beside
the
scaffold
,
closely
*NL*
muffling
his
Geneva
cloak
about
him
with
one
arm
,
and
holding
*NL*
the
lantern
before
his
breast
with
the
other
,
the
minister
could
*NL*
hardly
restrain
himself
from
speaking
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
evening
to
you
,
venerable
Father
Wilson
.
Come
up
*NL*
hither
,
I
pray
you
,
and
pass
a
pleasant
hour
with
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Good
Heavens
!
Had
Mr.
Dimmesdale
actually
spoken
?
For
one
*NL*
instant
he
believed
that
these
words
had
passed
his
lips
.
But
*NL*
they
were
uttered
only
within
his
imagination
.
The
venerable
*NL*
Father
Wilson
continued
to
step
slowly
onward
,
looking
carefully
*NL*
at
the
muddy
pathway
before
his
feet
,
and
never
once
turning
his
*NL*
head
towards
the
guilty
platform
.
When
the
light
of
the
*NL*
glimmering
lantern
had
faded
quite
away
,
the
minister
*NL*
discovered
,
by
the
faintness
which
came
over
him
,
that
the
last
*NL*
few
moments
had
been
a
crisis
of
terrible
anxiety
,
although
his
*NL*
mind
had
made
an
involuntary
effort
to
relieve
itself
by
a
kind
*NL*
of
lurid
playfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
afterwards
,
the
like
grisly
sense
of
the
humorous
again
*NL*
stole
in
among
the
solemn
phantoms
of
his
thought
.
He
felt
his
*NL*
limbs
growing
stiff
with
the
unaccustomed
chilliness
of
the
*NL*
night
,
and
doubted
whether
he
should
be
able
to
descend
the
*NL*
steps
of
the
scaffold
.
Morning
would
break
and
find
him
there
.
*NL*
The
neighbourhood
would
begin
to
rouse
itself
.
The
earliest
*NL*
riser
,
coming
forth
in
the
dim
twilight
,
would
perceive
a
*NL*
vaguely-defined
figure
aloft
on
the
place
of
shame
;
and
*NL*
half-crazed
betwixt
alarm
and
curiosity
,
would
go
knocking
from
*NL*
door
to
door
,
summoning
all
the
people
to
behold
the
ghost
--
as
*NL*
he
needs
must
think
it
--
of
some
defunct
transgressor
.
A
dusky
*NL*
tumult
would
flap
its
wings
from
one
house
to
another
.
Then
--
the
*NL*
morning
light
still
waxing
stronger
--
old
patriarchs
would
rise
*NL*
up
in
great
haste
,
each
in
his
flannel
gown
,
and
matronly
dames
,
*NL*
without
pausing
to
put
off
their
night-gear
.
The
whole
tribe
of
*NL*
decorous
personages
,
who
had
never
heretofore
been
seen
with
a
*NL*
single
hair
of
their
heads
awry
,
would
start
into
public
view
*NL*
with
the
disorder
of
a
nightmare
in
their
aspects
.
Old
Governor
*NL*
Bellingham
would
come
grimly
forth
,
with
his
King
James
'
ruff
*NL*
fastened
askew
,
and
Mistress
Hibbins
,
with
some
twigs
of
the
*NL*
forest
clinging
to
her
skirts
,
and
looking
sourer
than
ever
,
as
*NL*
having
hardly
got
a
wink
of
sleep
after
her
night
ride
;
and
good
*NL*
Father
Wilson
too
,
after
spending
half
the
night
at
a
death-bed
,
*NL*
and
liking
ill
to
be
disturbed
,
thus
early
,
out
of
his
dreams
*NL*
about
the
glorified
saints
.
Hither
,
likewise
,
would
come
the
*NL*
elders
and
deacons
of
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
church
,
and
the
young
*NL*
virgins
who
so
idolized
their
minister
,
and
had
made
a
shrine
*NL*
for
him
in
their
white
bosoms
,
which
now
,
by-the-bye
,
in
their
*NL*
hurry
and
confusion
,
they
would
scantly
have
given
themselves
*NL*
time
to
cover
with
their
kerchiefs
.
All
people
,
in
a
word
,
would
*NL*
come
stumbling
over
their
thresholds
,
and
turning
up
their
*NL*
amazed
and
horror-stricken
visages
around
the
scaffold
.
Whom
*NL*
would
they
discern
there
,
with
the
red
eastern
light
upon
his
*NL*
brow
?
Whom
,
but
the
Reverend
Arthur
Dimmesdale
,
half-frozen
to
*NL*
death
,
overwhelmed
with
shame
,
and
standing
where
Hester
Prynne
*NL*
had
stood
!
*NL*
*NL*
Carried
away
by
the
grotesque
horror
of
this
picture
,
the
*NL*
minister
,
unawares
,
and
to
his
own
infinite
alarm
,
burst
into
a
*NL*
great
peal
of
laughter
.
It
was
immediately
responded
to
by
a
*NL*
light
,
airy
,
childish
laugh
,
in
which
,
with
a
thrill
of
the
*NL*
heart
--
but
he
knew
not
whether
of
exquisite
pain
,
or
pleasure
as
*NL*
acute
--
he
recognised
the
tones
of
little
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pearl
!
Little
Pearl
!
''
cried
he
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
;
then
,
*NL*
suppressing
his
voice
--
``
Hester
!
Hester
Prynne
!
Are
you
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
is
Hester
Prynne
!
''
she
replied
,
in
a
tone
of
surprise
;
*NL*
and
the
minister
heard
her
footsteps
approaching
from
the
*NL*
side-walk
,
along
which
she
had
been
passing
.
``
It
is
I
,
and
my
*NL*
little
Pearl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whence
come
you
,
Hester
?
''
asked
the
minister
.
``
What
sent
you
*NL*
hither
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
watching
at
a
death-bed
,
''
answered
Hester
Prynne
*NL*
``
at
Governor
Winthrop
's
death-bed
,
and
have
taken
his
measure
*NL*
for
a
robe
,
and
am
now
going
homeward
to
my
dwelling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
up
hither
,
Hester
,
thou
and
little
Pearl
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
.
``
Ye
have
both
been
here
before
,
but
I
*NL*
was
not
with
you
.
Come
up
hither
once
again
,
and
we
will
stand
*NL*
all
three
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
silently
ascended
the
steps
,
and
stood
on
the
platform
,
*NL*
holding
little
Pearl
by
the
hand
.
The
minister
felt
for
the
*NL*
child
's
other
hand
,
and
took
it
.
The
moment
that
he
did
so
,
*NL*
there
came
what
seemed
a
tumultuous
rush
of
new
life
,
other
life
*NL*
than
his
own
pouring
like
a
torrent
into
his
heart
,
and
hurrying
*NL*
through
all
his
veins
,
as
if
the
mother
and
the
child
were
*NL*
communicating
their
vital
warmth
to
his
half-torpid
system
.
The
*NL*
three
formed
an
electric
chain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Minister
!
''
whispered
little
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
wouldst
thou
say
,
child
?
''
asked
Mr.
Dimmesdale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wilt
thou
stand
here
with
mother
and
me
,
to-morrow
noontide
?
''
*NL*
inquired
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
;
not
so
,
my
little
Pearl
,
''
answered
the
minister
;
for
,
with
*NL*
the
new
energy
of
the
moment
,
all
the
dread
of
public
exposure
,
*NL*
that
had
so
long
been
the
anguish
of
his
life
,
had
returned
upon
*NL*
him
;
and
he
was
already
trembling
at
the
conjunction
in
*NL*
which
--
with
a
strange
joy
,
nevertheless
--
he
now
found
*NL*
himself
--
``
not
so
,
my
child
.
I
shall
,
indeed
,
stand
with
thy
*NL*
mother
and
thee
one
other
day
,
but
not
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
laughed
,
and
attempted
to
pull
away
her
hand
.
But
the
*NL*
minister
held
it
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
moment
longer
,
my
child
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
wilt
thou
promise
,
''
asked
Pearl
,
``
to
take
my
hand
,
and
*NL*
mother
's
hand
,
to-morrow
noontide
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
then
,
Pearl
,
''
said
the
minister
;
``
but
another
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
other
time
?
''
persisted
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
great
judgment
day
,
''
whispered
the
minister
;
and
,
*NL*
strangely
enough
,
the
sense
that
he
was
a
professional
teacher
*NL*
of
the
truth
impelled
him
to
answer
the
child
so
.
``
Then
,
and
*NL*
there
,
before
the
judgment-seat
,
thy
mother
,
and
thou
,
and
I
*NL*
must
stand
together
.
But
the
daylight
of
this
world
shall
not
*NL*
see
our
meeting
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
Mr.
Dimmesdale
had
done
speaking
,
a
light
gleamed
far
*NL*
and
wide
over
all
the
muffled
sky
.
It
was
doubtless
caused
by
*NL*
one
of
those
meteors
,
which
the
night-watcher
may
so
often
*NL*
observe
burning
out
to
waste
,
in
the
vacant
regions
of
the
*NL*
atmosphere
.
So
powerful
was
its
radiance
,
that
it
thoroughly
*NL*
illuminated
the
dense
medium
of
cloud
betwixt
the
sky
and
earth
.
*NL*
The
great
vault
brightened
,
like
the
dome
of
an
immense
lamp
.
It
*NL*
showed
the
familiar
scene
of
the
street
with
the
distinctness
of
*NL*
mid-day
,
but
also
with
the
awfulness
that
is
always
imparted
to
*NL*
familiar
objects
by
an
unaccustomed
light
.
The
wooden
houses
,
*NL*
with
their
jutting
storeys
and
quaint
gable-peaks
;
the
doorsteps
*NL*
and
thresholds
with
the
early
grass
springing
up
about
them
;
the
*NL*
garden-plots
,
black
with
freshly-turned
earth
;
the
wheel-track
,
*NL*
little
worn
,
and
even
in
the
market-place
margined
with
green
on
*NL*
either
side
--
all
were
visible
,
but
with
a
singularity
of
aspect
*NL*
that
seemed
to
give
another
moral
interpretation
to
the
things
*NL*
of
this
world
than
they
had
ever
borne
before
.
And
there
stood
*NL*
the
minister
,
with
his
hand
over
his
heart
;
and
Hester
Prynne
,
*NL*
with
the
embroidered
letter
glimmering
on
her
bosom
;
and
little
*NL*
Pearl
,
herself
a
symbol
,
and
the
connecting
link
between
those
*NL*
two
.
They
stood
in
the
noon
of
that
strange
and
solemn
*NL*
splendour
,
as
if
it
were
the
light
that
is
to
reveal
all
*NL*
secrets
,
and
the
daybreak
that
shall
unite
all
who
belong
to
one
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
witchcraft
in
little
Pearl
's
eyes
;
and
her
face
,
as
*NL*
she
glanced
upward
at
the
minister
,
wore
that
naughty
smile
*NL*
which
made
its
expression
frequently
so
elvish
.
She
withdrew
her
*NL*
hand
from
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
,
and
pointed
across
the
street
.
But
*NL*
he
clasped
both
his
hands
over
his
breast
,
and
cast
his
eyes
*NL*
towards
the
zenith
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
was
more
common
,
in
those
days
,
than
to
interpret
all
*NL*
meteoric
appearances
,
and
other
natural
phenomena
that
occurred
*NL*
with
less
regularity
than
the
rise
and
set
of
sun
and
moon
,
as
*NL*
so
many
revelations
from
a
supernatural
source
.
Thus
,
a
blazing
*NL*
spear
,
a
sword
of
flame
,
a
bow
,
or
a
sheaf
of
arrows
seen
in
the
*NL*
midnight
sky
,
prefigured
Indian
warfare
.
Pestilence
was
known
to
*NL*
have
been
foreboded
by
a
shower
of
crimson
light
.
We
doubt
*NL*
whether
any
marked
event
,
for
good
or
evil
,
ever
befell
New
*NL*
England
,
from
its
settlement
down
to
revolutionary
times
,
of
*NL*
which
the
inhabitants
had
not
been
previously
warned
by
some
*NL*
spectacle
of
its
nature
.
Not
seldom
,
it
had
been
seen
by
*NL*
multitudes
.
Oftener
,
however
,
its
credibility
rested
on
the
*NL*
faith
of
some
lonely
eye-witness
,
who
beheld
the
wonder
through
*NL*
the
coloured
,
magnifying
,
and
distorted
medium
of
his
*NL*
imagination
,
and
shaped
it
more
distinctly
in
his
after-thought
.
*NL*
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
majestic
idea
that
the
destiny
of
nations
*NL*
should
be
revealed
,
in
these
awful
hieroglyphics
,
on
the
cope
of
*NL*
heaven
.
A
scroll
so
wide
might
not
be
deemed
too
expensive
for
*NL*
Providence
to
write
a
people
's
doom
upon
.
The
belief
was
a
*NL*
favourite
one
with
our
forefathers
,
as
betokening
that
their
*NL*
infant
commonwealth
was
under
a
celestial
guardianship
of
*NL*
peculiar
intimacy
and
strictness
.
But
what
shall
we
say
,
when
an
*NL*
individual
discovers
a
revelation
addressed
to
himself
alone
,
on
*NL*
the
same
vast
sheet
of
record
.
In
such
a
case
,
it
could
only
be
*NL*
the
symptom
of
a
highly
disordered
mental
state
,
when
a
man
,
*NL*
rendered
morbidly
self-contemplative
by
long
,
intense
,
and
*NL*
secret
pain
,
had
extended
his
egotism
over
the
whole
expanse
of
*NL*
nature
,
until
the
firmament
itself
should
appear
no
more
than
a
*NL*
fitting
page
for
his
soul
's
history
and
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
impute
it
,
therefore
,
solely
to
the
disease
in
his
own
eye
*NL*
and
heart
that
the
minister
,
looking
upward
to
the
zenith
,
*NL*
beheld
there
the
appearance
of
an
immense
letter
--
the
letter
*NL*
A
--
marked
out
in
lines
of
dull
red
light
.
Not
but
the
meteor
may
*NL*
have
shown
itself
at
that
point
,
burning
duskily
through
a
veil
*NL*
of
cloud
,
but
with
no
such
shape
as
his
guilty
imagination
gave
*NL*
it
,
or
,
at
least
,
with
so
little
definiteness
,
that
another
's
*NL*
guilt
might
have
seen
another
symbol
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
singular
circumstance
that
characterised
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
's
psychological
state
at
this
moment
.
All
the
time
*NL*
that
he
gazed
upward
to
the
zenith
,
he
was
,
nevertheless
,
*NL*
perfectly
aware
that
little
Pearl
was
pointing
her
finger
towards
*NL*
old
Roger
Chillingworth
,
who
stood
at
no
great
distance
from
the
*NL*
scaffold
.
The
minister
appeared
to
see
him
,
with
the
same
glance
*NL*
that
discerned
the
miraculous
letter
.
To
his
feature
as
to
all
*NL*
other
objects
,
the
meteoric
light
imparted
a
new
expression
;
or
*NL*
it
might
well
be
that
the
physician
was
not
careful
then
,
as
at
*NL*
all
other
times
,
to
hide
the
malevolence
with
which
he
looked
*NL*
upon
his
victim
.
Certainly
,
if
the
meteor
kindled
up
the
sky
,
*NL*
and
disclosed
the
earth
,
with
an
awfulness
that
admonished
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
and
the
clergyman
of
the
day
of
judgment
,
then
*NL*
might
Roger
Chillingworth
have
passed
with
them
for
the
*NL*
arch-fiend
,
standing
there
with
a
smile
and
scowl
,
to
claim
his
*NL*
own
.
So
vivid
was
the
expression
,
or
so
intense
the
minister
's
*NL*
perception
of
it
,
that
it
seemed
still
to
remain
painted
on
the
*NL*
darkness
after
the
meteor
had
vanished
,
with
an
effect
as
if
the
*NL*
street
and
all
things
else
were
at
once
annihilated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
man
,
Hester
?
''
gasped
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
overcome
with
*NL*
terror
.
``
I
shiver
at
him
!
Dost
thou
know
the
man
?
I
hate
him
,
*NL*
Hester
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
remembered
her
oath
,
and
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
thee
,
my
soul
shivers
at
him
!
''
muttered
the
minister
*NL*
again
.
``
Who
is
he
?
Who
is
he
?
Canst
thou
do
nothing
for
me
?
I
*NL*
have
a
nameless
horror
of
the
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Minister
,
''
said
little
Pearl
,
``
I
can
tell
thee
who
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quickly
,
then
,
child
!
''
said
the
minister
,
bending
his
ear
close
*NL*
to
her
lips
.
``
Quickly
,
and
as
low
as
thou
canst
whisper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
mumbled
something
into
his
ear
that
sounded
,
indeed
,
like
*NL*
human
language
,
but
was
only
such
gibberish
as
children
may
be
*NL*
heard
amusing
themselves
with
by
the
hour
together
.
At
all
*NL*
events
,
if
it
involved
any
secret
information
in
regard
to
old
*NL*
Roger
Chillingworth
,
it
was
in
a
tongue
unknown
to
the
erudite
*NL*
clergyman
,
and
did
but
increase
the
bewilderment
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
The
elvish
child
then
laughed
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
mock
me
now
?
''
said
the
minister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
wast
not
bold
!
--
thou
wast
not
true
!
''
answered
the
child
.
*NL*
``
Thou
wouldst
not
promise
to
take
my
hand
,
and
mother
's
hand
,
*NL*
to-morrow
noon-tide
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worthy
sir
,
''
answered
the
physician
,
who
had
now
advanced
to
*NL*
the
foot
of
the
platform
--
``
pious
Master
Dimmesdale
!
can
this
be
*NL*
you
?
Well
,
well
,
indeed
!
We
men
of
study
,
whose
heads
are
in
our
*NL*
books
,
have
need
to
be
straitly
looked
after
!
We
dream
in
our
*NL*
waking
moments
,
and
walk
in
our
sleep
.
Come
,
good
sir
,
and
my
*NL*
dear
friend
,
I
pray
you
let
me
lead
you
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
knewest
thou
that
I
was
here
?
''
asked
the
minister
,
*NL*
fearfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Verily
,
and
in
good
faith
,
''
answered
Roger
Chillingworth
,
``
I
*NL*
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
.
I
had
spent
the
better
part
of
the
*NL*
night
at
the
bedside
of
the
worshipful
Governor
Winthrop
,
doing
*NL*
what
my
poor
skill
might
to
give
him
ease
.
He
,
going
home
to
a
*NL*
better
world
,
I
,
likewise
,
was
on
my
way
homeward
,
when
this
*NL*
light
shone
out
.
Come
with
me
,
I
beseech
you
,
Reverend
sir
,
else
*NL*
you
will
be
poorly
able
to
do
Sabbath
duty
to-morrow
.
Aha
!
see
*NL*
now
how
they
trouble
the
brain
--
these
books
!
--
these
books
!
You
*NL*
should
study
less
,
good
sir
,
and
take
a
little
pastime
,
or
these
*NL*
night
whimsies
will
grow
upon
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
home
with
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Dimmesdale
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
chill
despondency
,
like
one
awakening
,
all
nerveless
,
*NL*
from
an
ugly
dream
,
he
yielded
himself
to
the
physician
,
and
was
*NL*
led
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
however
,
being
the
Sabbath
,
he
preached
a
*NL*
discourse
which
was
held
to
be
the
richest
and
most
powerful
,
*NL*
and
the
most
replete
with
heavenly
influences
,
that
had
ever
*NL*
proceeded
from
his
lips
.
Souls
,
it
is
said
,
more
souls
than
one
,
*NL*
were
brought
to
the
truth
by
the
efficacy
of
that
sermon
,
and
*NL*
vowed
within
themselves
to
cherish
a
holy
gratitude
towards
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
throughout
the
long
hereafter
.
But
as
he
came
down
*NL*
the
pulpit
steps
,
the
grey-bearded
sexton
met
him
,
holding
up
a
*NL*
black
glove
,
which
the
minister
recognised
as
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
found
,
''
said
the
Sexton
,
``
this
morning
on
the
scaffold
*NL*
where
evil-doers
are
set
up
to
public
shame
.
Satan
dropped
it
*NL*
there
,
I
take
it
,
intending
a
scurrilous
jest
against
your
*NL*
reverence
.
But
,
indeed
,
he
was
blind
and
foolish
,
as
he
ever
and
*NL*
always
is
.
A
pure
hand
needs
no
glove
to
cover
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
my
good
friend
,
''
said
the
minister
,
gravely
,
but
*NL*
startled
at
heart
;
for
so
confused
was
his
remembrance
,
that
he
*NL*
had
almost
brought
himself
to
look
at
the
events
of
the
past
*NL*
night
as
visionary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
seems
to
be
my
glove
,
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
since
Satan
saw
fit
to
steal
it
,
your
reverence
must
needs
*NL*
handle
him
without
gloves
henceforward
,
''
remarked
the
old
*NL*
sexton
,
grimly
smiling
.
``
But
did
your
reverence
hear
of
the
*NL*
portent
that
was
seen
last
night
?
a
great
red
letter
in
the
*NL*
sky
--
the
letter
A
,
which
we
interpret
to
stand
for
Angel
.
For
,
*NL*
as
our
good
Governor
Winthrop
was
made
an
angel
this
past
night
,
*NL*
it
was
doubtless
held
fit
that
there
should
be
some
notice
*NL*
thereof
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
the
minister
;
``
I
had
not
heard
of
it

ANOTHER
VIEW
OF
HESTER
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
late
singular
interview
with
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
was
shocked
at
the
condition
to
which
she
found
the
*NL*
clergyman
reduced
.
His
nerve
seemed
absolutely
destroyed
.
His
*NL*
moral
force
was
abased
into
more
than
childish
weakness
.
It
*NL*
grovelled
helpless
on
the
ground
,
even
while
his
intellectual
*NL*
faculties
retained
their
pristine
strength
,
or
had
perhaps
*NL*
acquired
a
morbid
energy
,
which
disease
only
could
have
given
*NL*
them
.
With
her
knowledge
of
a
train
of
circumstances
hidden
from
*NL*
all
others
,
she
could
readily
infer
that
,
besides
the
legitimate
*NL*
action
of
his
own
conscience
,
a
terrible
machinery
had
been
*NL*
brought
to
bear
,
and
was
still
operating
,
on
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
*NL*
well-being
and
repose
.
Knowing
what
this
poor
fallen
man
had
*NL*
once
been
,
her
whole
soul
was
moved
by
the
shuddering
terror
*NL*
with
which
he
had
appealed
to
her
--
the
outcast
woman
--
for
*NL*
support
against
his
instinctively
discovered
enemy
.
She
decided
,
*NL*
moreover
,
that
he
had
a
right
to
her
utmost
aid
.
Little
*NL*
accustomed
,
in
her
long
seclusion
from
society
,
to
measure
her
*NL*
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
by
any
standard
external
to
herself
,
*NL*
Hester
saw
--
or
seemed
to
see
--
that
there
lay
a
responsibility
*NL*
upon
her
in
reference
to
the
clergyman
,
which
she
owned
to
no
*NL*
other
,
nor
to
the
whole
world
besides
.
The
links
that
united
her
*NL*
to
the
rest
of
humankind
--
links
of
flowers
,
or
silk
,
or
gold
,
or
*NL*
whatever
the
material
--
had
all
been
broken
.
Here
was
the
iron
*NL*
link
of
mutual
crime
,
which
neither
he
nor
she
could
break
.
Like
*NL*
all
other
ties
,
it
brought
along
with
it
its
obligations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
did
not
now
occupy
precisely
the
same
position
in
*NL*
which
we
beheld
her
during
the
earlier
periods
of
her
ignominy
.
*NL*
Years
had
come
and
gone
.
Pearl
was
now
seven
years
old
.
Her
*NL*
mother
,
with
the
scarlet
letter
on
her
breast
,
glittering
in
its
*NL*
fantastic
embroidery
,
had
long
been
a
familiar
object
to
the
*NL*
townspeople
.
As
is
apt
to
be
the
case
when
a
person
stands
out
*NL*
in
any
prominence
before
the
community
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
interferes
neither
with
public
nor
individual
interests
and
*NL*
convenience
,
a
species
of
general
regard
had
ultimately
grown
up
*NL*
in
reference
to
Hester
Prynne
.
It
is
to
the
credit
of
human
*NL*
nature
that
,
except
where
its
selfishness
is
brought
into
play
,
*NL*
it
loves
more
readily
than
it
hates
.
Hatred
,
by
a
gradual
and
*NL*
quiet
process
,
will
even
be
transformed
to
love
,
unless
the
*NL*
change
be
impeded
by
a
continually
new
irritation
of
the
*NL*
original
feeling
of
hostility
.
In
this
matter
of
Hester
Prynne
*NL*
there
was
neither
irritation
nor
irksomeness
.
She
never
battled
*NL*
with
the
public
,
but
submitted
uncomplainingly
to
its
worst
*NL*
usage
;
she
made
no
claim
upon
it
in
requital
for
what
she
*NL*
suffered
;
she
did
not
weigh
upon
its
sympathies
.
Then
,
also
,
the
*NL*
blameless
purity
of
her
life
during
all
these
years
in
which
she
*NL*
had
been
set
apart
to
infamy
was
reckoned
largely
in
her
favour
.
*NL*
With
nothing
now
to
lose
,
in
the
sight
of
mankind
,
and
with
no
*NL*
hope
,
and
seemingly
no
wish
,
of
gaining
anything
,
it
could
only
*NL*
be
a
genuine
regard
for
virtue
that
had
brought
back
the
poor
*NL*
wanderer
to
its
paths
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
perceived
,
too
,
that
while
Hester
never
put
forward
even
*NL*
the
humblest
title
to
share
in
the
world
's
privileges
--
further
*NL*
than
to
breathe
the
common
air
and
earn
daily
bread
for
little
*NL*
Pearl
and
herself
by
the
faithful
labour
of
her
hands
--
she
was
*NL*
quick
to
acknowledge
her
sisterhood
with
the
race
of
man
*NL*
whenever
benefits
were
to
be
conferred
.
None
so
ready
as
she
to
*NL*
give
of
her
little
substance
to
every
demand
of
poverty
,
even
*NL*
though
the
bitter-hearted
pauper
threw
back
a
gibe
in
requital
*NL*
of
the
food
brought
regularly
to
his
door
,
or
the
garments
*NL*
wrought
for
him
by
the
fingers
that
could
have
embroidered
a
*NL*
monarch
's
robe
.
None
so
self-devoted
as
Hester
when
pestilence
*NL*
stalked
through
the
town
.
In
all
seasons
of
calamity
,
indeed
,
*NL*
whether
general
or
of
individuals
,
the
outcast
of
society
at
*NL*
once
found
her
place
.
She
came
,
not
as
a
guest
,
but
as
a
*NL*
rightful
inmate
,
into
the
household
that
was
darkened
by
*NL*
trouble
,
as
if
its
gloomy
twilight
were
a
medium
in
which
she
*NL*
was
entitled
to
hold
intercourse
with
her
fellow-creature
.
There
*NL*
glimmered
the
embroidered
letter
,
with
comfort
in
its
unearthly
*NL*
ray
.
Elsewhere
the
token
of
sin
,
it
was
the
taper
of
the
sick
*NL*
chamber
.
It
had
even
thrown
its
gleam
,
in
the
sufferer
's
bard
*NL*
extremity
,
across
the
verge
of
time
.
It
had
shown
him
where
to
*NL*
set
his
foot
,
while
the
light
of
earth
was
fast
becoming
dim
,
*NL*
and
ere
the
light
of
futurity
could
reach
him
.
In
such
*NL*
emergencies
Hester
's
nature
showed
itself
warm
and
rich
--
a
*NL*
well-spring
of
human
tenderness
,
unfailing
to
every
real
demand
,
*NL*
and
inexhaustible
by
the
largest
.
Her
breast
,
with
its
badge
of
*NL*
shame
,
was
but
the
softer
pillow
for
the
head
that
needed
one
.
*NL*
She
was
self-ordained
a
Sister
of
Mercy
,
or
,
we
may
rather
say
,
*NL*
the
world
's
heavy
hand
had
so
ordained
her
,
when
neither
the
*NL*
world
nor
she
looked
forward
to
this
result
.
The
letter
was
the
*NL*
symbol
of
her
calling
.
Such
helpfulness
was
found
in
her
--
so
*NL*
much
power
to
do
,
and
power
to
sympathise
--
that
many
people
*NL*
refused
to
interpret
the
scarlet
A
by
its
original
*NL*
signification
.
They
said
that
it
meant
Abel
,
so
strong
was
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
,
with
a
woman
's
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
the
darkened
house
that
could
contain
her
.
When
*NL*
sunshine
came
again
,
she
was
not
there
.
Her
shadow
had
faded
*NL*
across
the
threshold
.
The
helpful
inmate
had
departed
,
without
*NL*
one
backward
glance
to
gather
up
the
meed
of
gratitude
,
if
any
*NL*
were
in
the
hearts
of
those
whom
she
had
served
so
zealously
.
*NL*
Meeting
them
in
the
street
,
she
never
raised
her
head
to
receive
*NL*
their
greeting
.
If
they
were
resolute
to
accost
her
,
she
laid
*NL*
her
finger
on
the
scarlet
letter
,
and
passed
on
.
This
might
be
*NL*
pride
,
but
was
so
like
humility
,
that
it
produced
all
the
*NL*
softening
influence
of
the
latter
quality
on
the
public
mind
.
*NL*
The
public
is
despotic
in
its
temper
;
it
is
capable
of
denying
*NL*
common
justice
when
too
strenuously
demanded
as
a
right
;
but
*NL*
quite
as
frequently
it
awards
more
than
justice
,
when
the
appeal
*NL*
is
made
,
as
despots
love
to
have
it
made
,
entirely
to
its
*NL*
generosity
.
Interpreting
Hester
Prynne
's
deportment
as
an
appeal
*NL*
of
this
nature
,
society
was
inclined
to
show
its
former
victim
a
*NL*
more
benign
countenance
than
she
cared
to
be
favoured
with
,
or
,
*NL*
perchance
,
than
she
deserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rulers
,
and
the
wise
and
learned
men
of
the
community
,
were
*NL*
longer
in
acknowledging
the
influence
of
Hester
's
good
qualities
*NL*
than
the
people
.
The
prejudices
which
they
shared
in
common
with
*NL*
the
latter
were
fortified
in
themselves
by
an
iron
frame-work
of
*NL*
reasoning
,
that
made
it
a
far
tougher
labour
to
expel
them
.
Day
*NL*
by
day
,
nevertheless
,
their
sour
and
rigid
wrinkles
were
*NL*
relaxing
into
something
which
,
in
the
due
course
of
years
,
might
*NL*
grow
to
be
an
expression
of
almost
benevolence
.
Thus
it
was
with
*NL*
the
men
of
rank
,
on
whom
their
eminent
position
imposed
the
*NL*
guardianship
of
the
public
morals
.
Individuals
in
private
life
,
*NL*
meanwhile
,
had
quite
forgiven
Hester
Prynne
for
her
frailty
;
*NL*
nay
,
more
,
they
had
begun
to
look
upon
the
scarlet
letter
as
the
*NL*
token
,
not
of
that
one
sin
for
which
she
had
borne
so
long
and
*NL*
dreary
a
penance
,
but
of
her
many
good
deeds
since
.
``
Do
you
see
*NL*
that
woman
with
the
embroidered
badge
?
''
they
would
say
to
*NL*
strangers
.
``
It
is
our
Hester
--
the
town
's
own
Hester
--
who
is
so
*NL*
kind
to
the
poor
,
so
helpful
to
the
sick
,
so
comfortable
to
the
*NL*
afflicted
!
''
Then
,
it
is
true
,
the
propensity
of
human
nature
to
*NL*
tell
the
very
worst
of
itself
,
when
embodied
in
the
person
of
*NL*
another
,
would
constrain
them
to
whisper
the
black
scandal
of
*NL*
bygone
years
.
It
was
none
the
less
a
fact
,
however
,
that
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
very
men
who
spoke
thus
,
the
scarlet
letter
had
the
*NL*
effect
of
the
cross
on
a
nun
's
bosom
.
It
imparted
to
the
wearer
*NL*
a
kind
of
sacredness
,
which
enabled
her
to
walk
securely
amid
*NL*
all
peril
.
Had
she
fallen
among
thieves
,
it
would
have
kept
her
*NL*
safe
.
It
was
reported
,
and
believed
by
many
,
that
an
Indian
had
*NL*
drawn
his
arrow
against
the
badge
,
and
that
the
missile
struck
*NL*
it
,
and
fell
harmless
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
the
symbol
--
or
rather
,
of
the
position
in
respect
*NL*
to
society
that
was
indicated
by
it
--
on
the
mind
of
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
herself
was
powerful
and
peculiar
.
All
the
light
and
*NL*
graceful
foliage
of
her
character
had
been
withered
up
by
this
*NL*
red-hot
brand
,
and
had
long
ago
fallen
away
,
leaving
a
bare
and
*NL*
harsh
outline
,
which
might
have
been
repulsive
had
she
possessed
*NL*
friends
or
companions
to
be
repelled
by
it
.
Even
the
*NL*
attractiveness
of
her
person
had
undergone
a
similar
change
.
It
*NL*
might
be
partly
owing
to
the
studied
austerity
of
her
dress
,
and
*NL*
partly
to
the
lack
of
demonstration
in
her
manners
.
It
was
a
sad
*NL*
transformation
,
too
,
that
her
rich
and
luxuriant
hair
had
either
*NL*
been
cut
off
,
or
was
so
completely
hidden
by
a
cap
,
that
not
a
*NL*
shining
lock
of
it
ever
once
gushed
into
the
sunshine
.
It
was
*NL*
due
in
part
to
all
these
causes
,
but
still
more
to
something
*NL*
else
,
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
longer
anything
in
Hester
's
*NL*
face
for
Love
to
dwell
upon
;
nothing
in
Hester
's
form
,
though
*NL*
majestic
and
statue
like
,
that
Passion
would
ever
dream
of
*NL*
clasping
in
its
embrace
;
nothing
in
Hester
's
bosom
to
make
it
*NL*
ever
again
the
pillow
of
Affection
.
Some
attribute
had
departed
*NL*
from
her
,
the
permanence
of
which
had
been
essential
to
keep
her
*NL*
a
woman
.
Such
is
frequently
the
fate
,
and
such
the
stern
*NL*
development
,
of
the
feminine
character
and
person
,
when
the
*NL*
woman
has
encountered
,
and
lived
through
,
an
experience
of
*NL*
peculiar
severity
.
If
she
be
all
tenderness
,
she
will
die
.
If
*NL*
she
survive
,
the
tenderness
will
either
be
crushed
out
of
her
,
*NL*
or
--
and
the
outward
semblance
is
the
same
--
crushed
so
deeply
*NL*
into
her
heart
that
it
can
never
show
itself
more
.
The
latter
is
*NL*
perhaps
the
truest
theory
.
She
who
has
once
been
a
woman
,
and
*NL*
ceased
to
be
so
,
might
at
any
moment
become
a
woman
again
,
if
*NL*
there
were
only
the
magic
touch
to
effect
the
transformation
.
We
*NL*
shall
see
whether
Hester
Prynne
were
ever
afterwards
so
touched
*NL*
and
so
transfigured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
of
the
marble
coldness
of
Hester
's
impression
was
to
be
*NL*
attributed
to
the
circumstance
that
her
life
had
turned
,
in
a
*NL*
great
measure
,
from
passion
and
feeling
to
thought
.
Standing
*NL*
alone
in
the
world
--
alone
,
as
to
any
dependence
on
society
,
and
*NL*
with
little
Pearl
to
be
guided
and
protected
--
alone
,
and
*NL*
hopeless
of
retrieving
her
position
,
even
had
she
not
scorned
to
*NL*
consider
it
desirable
--
she
cast
away
the
fragment
of
a
broken
*NL*
chain
.
The
world
's
law
was
no
law
for
her
mind
.
It
was
an
age
in
*NL*
which
the
human
intellect
,
newly
emancipated
,
had
taken
a
more
*NL*
active
and
a
wider
range
than
for
many
centuries
before
.
Men
of
*NL*
the
sword
had
overthrown
nobles
and
kings
.
Men
bolder
than
these
*NL*
had
overthrown
and
rearranged
--
not
actually
,
but
within
the
*NL*
sphere
of
theory
,
which
was
their
most
real
abode
--
the
whole
*NL*
system
of
ancient
prejudice
,
wherewith
was
linked
much
of
*NL*
ancient
principle
.
Hester
Prynne
imbibed
this
spirit
.
She
*NL*
assumed
a
freedom
of
speculation
,
then
common
enough
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
Atlantic
,
but
which
our
forefathers
,
had
they
*NL*
known
it
,
would
have
held
to
be
a
deadlier
crime
than
that
*NL*
stigmatised
by
the
scarlet
letter
.
In
her
lonesome
cottage
,
by
*NL*
the
seashore
,
thoughts
visited
her
such
as
dared
to
enter
no
*NL*
other
dwelling
in
New
England
;
shadowy
guests
,
that
would
have
*NL*
been
as
perilous
as
demons
to
their
entertainer
,
could
they
have
*NL*
been
seen
so
much
as
knocking
at
her
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
remarkable
that
persons
who
speculate
the
most
boldly
*NL*
often
conform
with
the
most
perfect
quietude
to
the
external
*NL*
regulations
of
society
.
The
thought
suffices
them
,
without
*NL*
investing
itself
in
the
flesh
and
blood
of
action
.
So
it
seemed
*NL*
to
be
with
Hester
.
Yet
,
had
little
Pearl
never
come
to
her
from
*NL*
the
spiritual
world
,
it
might
have
been
far
otherwise
.
Then
she
*NL*
might
have
come
down
to
us
in
history
,
hand
in
hand
with
Ann
*NL*
Hutchinson
,
as
the
foundress
of
a
religious
sect
.
She
might
,
in
*NL*
one
of
her
phases
,
have
been
a
prophetess
.
She
might
,
and
not
*NL*
improbably
would
,
have
suffered
death
from
the
stern
tribunals
*NL*
of
the
period
,
for
attempting
to
undermine
the
foundations
of
*NL*
the
Puritan
establishment
.
But
,
in
the
education
of
her
child
,
*NL*
the
mother
's
enthusiasm
of
thought
had
something
to
wreak
itself
*NL*
upon
.
Providence
,
in
the
person
of
this
little
girl
,
had
*NL*
assigned
to
Hester
's
charge
,
the
germ
and
blossom
of
womanhood
,
*NL*
to
be
cherished
and
developed
amid
a
host
of
difficulties
.
*NL*
Everything
was
against
her
.
The
world
was
hostile
.
The
child
's
*NL*
own
nature
had
something
wrong
in
it
which
continually
betokened
*NL*
that
she
had
been
born
amiss
--
the
effluence
of
her
mother
's
*NL*
lawless
passion
--
and
often
impelled
Hester
to
ask
,
in
bitterness
*NL*
of
heart
,
whether
it
were
for
ill
or
good
that
the
poor
little
*NL*
creature
had
been
born
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
the
same
dark
question
often
rose
into
her
mind
with
*NL*
reference
to
the
whole
race
of
womanhood
.
Was
existence
worth
*NL*
accepting
even
to
the
happiest
among
them
?
As
concerned
her
own
*NL*
individual
existence
,
she
had
long
ago
decided
in
the
negative
,
*NL*
and
dismissed
the
point
as
settled
.
A
tendency
to
speculation
,
*NL*
though
it
may
keep
women
quiet
,
as
it
does
man
,
yet
makes
her
*NL*
sad
.
She
discerns
,
it
may
be
,
such
a
hopeless
task
before
her
.
*NL*
As
a
first
step
,
the
whole
system
of
society
is
to
be
torn
down
*NL*
and
built
up
anew
.
Then
the
very
nature
of
the
opposite
sex
,
or
*NL*
its
long
hereditary
habit
,
which
has
become
like
nature
,
is
to
*NL*
be
essentially
modified
before
woman
can
be
allowed
to
assume
*NL*
what
seems
a
fair
and
suitable
position
.
Finally
,
all
other
*NL*
difficulties
being
obviated
,
woman
can
not
take
advantage
of
*NL*
these
preliminary
reforms
until
she
herself
shall
have
undergone
*NL*
a
still
mightier
change
,
in
which
,
perhaps
,
the
ethereal
*NL*
essence
,
wherein
she
has
her
truest
life
,
will
be
found
to
have
*NL*
evaporated
.
A
woman
never
overcomes
these
problems
by
any
*NL*
exercise
of
thought
.
They
are
not
to
be
solved
,
or
only
in
one
*NL*
way
.
If
her
heart
chance
to
come
uppermost
,
they
vanish
.
Thus
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
,
whose
heart
had
lost
its
regular
and
healthy
*NL*
throb
,
wandered
without
a
clue
in
the
dark
labyrinth
of
mind
;
*NL*
now
turned
aside
by
an
insurmountable
precipice
;
now
starting
*NL*
back
from
a
deep
chasm
.
There
was
wild
and
ghastly
scenery
all
*NL*
around
her
,
and
a
home
and
comfort
nowhere
.
At
times
a
fearful
*NL*
doubt
strove
to
possess
her
soul
,
whether
it
were
not
better
to
*NL*
send
Pearl
at
once
to
Heaven
,
and
go
herself
to
such
futurity
as
*NL*
Eternal
Justice
should
provide
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scarlet
letter
had
not
done
its
office
.
Now
,
however
,
her
*NL*
interview
with
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
on
the
night
of
his
*NL*
vigil
,
had
given
her
a
new
theme
of
reflection
,
and
held
up
to
*NL*
her
an
object
that
appeared
worthy
of
any
exertion
and
sacrifice
*NL*
for
its
attainment
.
She
had
witnessed
the
intense
misery
beneath
*NL*
which
the
minister
struggled
,
or
,
to
speak
more
accurately
,
had
*NL*
ceased
to
struggle
.
She
saw
that
he
stood
on
the
verge
of
*NL*
lunacy
,
if
he
had
not
already
stepped
across
it
.
It
was
*NL*
impossible
to
doubt
that
,
whatever
painful
efficacy
there
might
*NL*
be
in
the
secret
sting
of
remorse
,
a
deadlier
venom
had
been
*NL*
infused
into
it
by
the
hand
that
proffered
relief
.
A
secret
*NL*
enemy
had
been
continually
by
his
side
,
under
the
semblance
of
a
*NL*
friend
and
helper
,
and
had
availed
himself
of
the
opportunities
*NL*
thus
afforded
for
tampering
with
the
delicate
springs
of
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
's
nature
.
Hester
could
not
but
ask
herself
whether
*NL*
there
had
not
originally
been
a
defect
of
truth
,
courage
,
and
*NL*
loyalty
on
her
own
part
,
in
allowing
the
minister
to
be
thrown
*NL*
into
a
position
where
so
much
evil
was
to
be
foreboded
and
nothing
*NL*
auspicious
to
be
hoped
.
Her
only
justification
lay
in
the
fact
*NL*
that
she
had
been
able
to
discern
no
method
of
rescuing
him
from
*NL*
a
blacker
ruin
than
had
overwhelmed
herself
except
by
*NL*
acquiescing
in
Roger
Chillingworth
's
scheme
of
disguise
.
Under
*NL*
that
impulse
she
had
made
her
choice
,
and
had
chosen
,
as
it
now
*NL*
appeared
,
the
more
wretched
alternative
of
the
two
.
She
*NL*
determined
to
redeem
her
error
so
far
as
it
might
yet
be
*NL*
possible
.
Strengthened
by
years
of
hard
and
solemn
trial
,
she
*NL*
felt
herself
no
longer
so
inadequate
to
cope
with
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
as
on
that
night
,
abased
by
sin
and
half-maddened
*NL*
by
the
ignominy
that
was
still
new
,
when
they
had
talked
*NL*
together
in
the
prison-chamber
.
She
had
climbed
her
way
since
*NL*
then
to
a
higher
point
.
The
old
man
,
on
the
other
hand
,
had
*NL*
brought
himself
nearer
to
her
level
,
or
,
perhaps
,
below
it
,
by
*NL*
the
revenge
which
he
had
stooped
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fine
,
Hester
Prynne
resolved
to
meet
her
former
husband
,
and
*NL*
do
what
might
be
in
her
power
for
the
rescue
of
the
victim
on
*NL*
whom
he
had
so
evidently
set
his
gripe
.
The
occasion
was
not
*NL*
long
to
seek
.
One
afternoon
,
walking
with
Pearl
in
a
retired
*NL*
part
of
the
peninsula
,
she
beheld
the
old
physician
with
a
*NL*
basket
on
one
arm
and
a
staff
in
the
other
hand
,
stooping
along
*NL*
the
ground
in
quest
of
roots
and
herbs
to
concoct
his
medicine
*NL*
withal
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XIV
.
HESTER
AND
THE
PHYSICIAN
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
bade
little
Pearl
run
down
to
the
margin
of
the
water
,
*NL*
and
play
with
the
shells
and
tangled
sea-weed
,
until
she
should
*NL*
have
talked
awhile
with
yonder
gatherer
of
herbs
.
So
the
child
*NL*
flew
away
like
a
bird
,
and
,
making
bare
her
small
white
feet
*NL*
went
pattering
along
the
moist
margin
of
the
sea
.
Here
and
there
*NL*
she
came
to
a
full
stop
,
and
peeped
curiously
into
a
pool
,
left
*NL*
by
the
retiring
tide
as
a
mirror
for
Pearl
to
see
her
face
in
.
*NL*
Forth
peeped
at
her
,
out
of
the
pool
,
with
dark
,
glistening
*NL*
curls
around
her
head
,
and
an
elf-smile
in
her
eyes
,
the
image
*NL*
of
a
little
maid
whom
Pearl
,
having
no
other
playmate
,
invited
*NL*
to
take
her
hand
and
run
a
race
with
her
.
But
the
visionary
*NL*
little
maid
on
her
part
,
beckoned
likewise
,
as
if
to
say
--
``
This
*NL*
is
a
better
place
;
come
thou
into
the
pool
.
''
And
Pearl
,
stepping
*NL*
in
mid-leg
deep
,
beheld
her
own
white
feet
at
the
bottom
;
while
,
*NL*
out
of
a
still
lower
depth
,
came
the
gleam
of
a
kind
of
*NL*
fragmentary
smile
,
floating
to
and
fro
in
the
agitated
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
her
mother
had
accosted
the
physician
.
``
I
would
speak
*NL*
a
word
with
you
,
''
said
she
--
``
a
word
that
concerns
us
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
!
and
is
it
Mistress
Hester
that
has
a
word
for
old
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
?
''
answered
he
,
raising
himself
from
his
stooping
*NL*
posture
.
``
With
all
my
heart
!
Why
,
mistress
,
I
hear
good
tidings
*NL*
of
you
on
all
hands
!
No
longer
ago
than
yester-eve
,
a
*NL*
magistrate
,
a
wise
and
godly
man
,
was
discoursing
of
your
*NL*
affairs
,
Mistress
Hester
,
and
whispered
me
that
there
had
been
*NL*
question
concerning
you
in
the
council
.
It
was
debated
whether
*NL*
or
no
,
with
safety
to
the
commonweal
,
yonder
scarlet
letter
*NL*
might
be
taken
off
your
bosom
.
On
my
life
,
Hester
,
I
made
my
*NL*
intreaty
to
the
worshipful
magistrate
that
it
might
be
done
*NL*
forthwith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
lies
not
in
the
pleasure
of
the
magistrates
to
take
off
the
*NL*
badge
,
''
calmly
replied
Hester
.
``
Were
I
worthy
to
be
quit
of
it
,
*NL*
it
would
fall
away
of
its
own
nature
,
or
be
transformed
into
*NL*
something
that
should
speak
a
different
purport
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
then
,
wear
it
,
if
it
suit
you
better
,
''
rejoined
he
,
``
A
*NL*
woman
must
needs
follow
her
own
fancy
touching
the
adornment
of
*NL*
her
person
.
The
letter
is
gaily
embroidered
,
and
shows
right
*NL*
bravely
on
your
bosom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
Hester
had
been
looking
steadily
at
the
old
man
,
*NL*
and
was
shocked
,
as
well
as
wonder-smitten
,
to
discern
what
a
*NL*
change
had
been
wrought
upon
him
within
the
past
seven
years
.
It
*NL*
was
not
so
much
that
he
had
grown
older
;
for
though
the
traces
*NL*
of
advancing
life
were
visible
he
bore
his
age
well
,
and
seemed
*NL*
to
retain
a
wiry
vigour
and
alertness
.
But
the
former
aspect
of
*NL*
an
intellectual
and
studious
man
,
calm
and
quiet
,
which
was
what
*NL*
she
best
remembered
in
him
,
had
altogether
vanished
,
and
been
*NL*
succeeded
by
an
eager
,
searching
,
almost
fierce
,
yet
carefully
*NL*
guarded
look
.
It
seemed
to
be
his
wish
and
purpose
to
mask
this
*NL*
expression
with
a
smile
,
but
the
latter
played
him
false
,
and
*NL*
flickered
over
his
visage
so
derisively
that
the
spectator
could
*NL*
see
his
blackness
all
the
better
for
it
.
Ever
and
anon
,
too
,
*NL*
there
came
a
glare
of
red
light
out
of
his
eyes
,
as
if
the
old
*NL*
man
's
soul
were
on
fire
and
kept
on
smouldering
duskily
within
*NL*
his
breast
,
until
by
some
casual
puff
of
passion
it
was
blown
*NL*
into
a
momentary
flame
.
This
he
repressed
as
speedily
as
*NL*
possible
,
and
strove
to
look
as
if
nothing
of
the
kind
had
*NL*
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
old
Roger
Chillingworth
was
a
striking
evidence
of
*NL*
man
's
faculty
of
transforming
himself
into
a
devil
,
if
he
will
*NL*
only
,
for
a
reasonable
space
of
time
,
undertake
a
devil
's
*NL*
office
.
This
unhappy
person
had
effected
such
a
transformation
*NL*
by
devoting
himself
for
seven
years
to
the
constant
analysis
of
*NL*
a
heart
full
of
torture
,
and
deriving
his
enjoyment
thence
,
and
*NL*
adding
fuel
to
those
fiery
tortures
which
he
analysed
and
*NL*
gloated
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scarlet
letter
burned
on
Hester
Prynne
's
bosom
.
Here
was
*NL*
another
ruin
,
the
responsibility
of
which
came
partly
home
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
see
you
in
my
face
,
''
asked
the
physician
,
``
that
you
look
*NL*
at
it
so
earnestly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
that
would
make
me
weep
,
if
there
were
any
tears
*NL*
bitter
enough
for
it
,
''
answered
she
.
``
But
let
it
pass
!
It
is
of
*NL*
yonder
miserable
man
that
I
would
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
of
him
?
''
cried
Roger
Chillingworth
,
eagerly
,
as
if
he
*NL*
loved
the
topic
,
and
were
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
discuss
it
*NL*
with
the
only
person
of
whom
he
could
make
a
confidant
.
``
Not
to
*NL*
hide
the
truth
,
Mistress
Hester
,
my
thoughts
happen
just
now
to
*NL*
be
busy
with
the
gentleman
.
So
speak
freely
and
I
will
make
*NL*
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
last
spake
together
,
''
said
Hester
,
``
now
seven
years
*NL*
ago
,
it
was
your
pleasure
to
extort
a
promise
of
secrecy
as
*NL*
touching
the
former
relation
betwixt
yourself
and
me
.
As
the
*NL*
life
and
good
fame
of
yonder
man
were
in
your
hands
there
seemed
*NL*
no
choice
to
me
,
save
to
be
silent
in
accordance
with
your
*NL*
behest
.
Yet
it
was
not
without
heavy
misgivings
that
I
thus
*NL*
bound
myself
,
for
,
having
cast
off
all
duty
towards
other
human
*NL*
beings
,
there
remained
a
duty
towards
him
,
and
something
*NL*
whispered
me
that
I
was
betraying
it
in
pledging
myself
to
keep
*NL*
your
counsel
.
Since
that
day
no
man
is
so
near
to
him
as
you
.
*NL*
You
tread
behind
his
every
footstep
.
You
are
beside
him
,
*NL*
sleeping
and
waking
.
You
search
his
thoughts
.
You
burrow
and
*NL*
rankle
in
his
heart
!
Your
clutch
is
on
his
life
,
and
you
cause
*NL*
him
to
die
daily
a
living
death
,
and
still
he
knows
you
not
.
In
*NL*
permitting
this
I
have
surely
acted
a
false
part
by
the
only
man
*NL*
to
whom
the
power
was
left
me
to
be
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
choice
had
you
?
''
asked
Roger
Chillingworth
.
``
My
finger
,
*NL*
pointed
at
this
man
,
would
have
hurled
him
from
his
pulpit
into
*NL*
a
dungeon
,
thence
,
peradventure
,
to
the
gallows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
had
been
better
so
!
''
said
Hester
Prynne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
evil
have
I
done
the
man
?
''
asked
Roger
Chillingworth
*NL*
again
.
``
I
tell
thee
,
Hester
Prynne
,
the
richest
fee
that
ever
*NL*
physician
earned
from
monarch
could
not
have
bought
such
care
as
*NL*
I
have
wasted
on
this
miserable
priest
!
But
for
my
aid
his
life
*NL*
would
have
burned
away
in
torments
within
the
first
two
years
*NL*
after
the
perpetration
of
his
crime
and
thine
.
For
,
Hester
,
his
*NL*
spirit
lacked
the
strength
that
could
have
borne
up
,
as
thine
*NL*
has
,
beneath
a
burden
like
thy
scarlet
letter
.
Oh
,
I
could
*NL*
reveal
a
goodly
secret
!
But
enough
.
What
art
can
do
,
I
have
*NL*
exhausted
on
him
.
That
he
now
breathes
and
creeps
about
on
earth
*NL*
is
owing
all
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
he
had
died
at
once
!
''
said
Hester
Prynne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yea
,
woman
,
thou
sayest
truly
!
''
cried
old
Roger
Chillingworth
,
*NL*
letting
the
lurid
fire
of
his
heart
blaze
out
before
her
eyes
.
*NL*
``
Better
had
he
died
at
once
!
Never
did
mortal
suffer
what
this
*NL*
man
has
suffered
.
And
all
,
all
,
in
the
sight
of
his
worst
enemy
!
*NL*
He
has
been
conscious
of
me
.
He
has
felt
an
influence
dwelling
*NL*
always
upon
him
like
a
curse
.
He
knew
,
by
some
spiritual
*NL*
sense
--
for
the
Creator
never
made
another
being
so
sensitive
as
*NL*
this
--
he
knew
that
no
friendly
hand
was
pulling
at
his
*NL*
heartstrings
,
and
that
an
eye
was
looking
curiously
into
him
,
*NL*
which
sought
only
evil
,
and
found
it
.
But
he
knew
not
that
the
*NL*
eye
and
hand
were
mine
!
With
the
superstition
common
to
his
*NL*
brotherhood
,
he
fancied
himself
given
over
to
a
fiend
,
to
be
*NL*
tortured
with
frightful
dreams
and
desperate
thoughts
,
the
sting
*NL*
of
remorse
and
despair
of
pardon
,
as
a
foretaste
of
what
awaits
*NL*
him
beyond
the
grave
.
But
it
was
the
constant
shadow
of
my
*NL*
presence
,
the
closest
propinquity
of
the
man
whom
he
had
most
*NL*
vilely
wronged
,
and
who
had
grown
to
exist
only
by
this
*NL*
perpetual
poison
of
the
direst
revenge
!
Yea
,
indeed
,
he
did
not
*NL*
err
,
there
was
a
fiend
at
his
elbow
!
A
mortal
man
,
with
once
a
*NL*
human
heart
,
has
become
a
fiend
for
his
especial
torment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unfortunate
physician
,
while
uttering
these
words
,
lifted
*NL*
his
hands
with
a
look
of
horror
,
as
if
he
had
beheld
some
*NL*
frightful
shape
,
which
he
could
not
recognise
,
usurping
the
*NL*
place
of
his
own
image
in
a
glass
.
It
was
one
of
those
*NL*
moments
--
which
sometimes
occur
only
at
the
interval
of
*NL*
years
--
when
a
man
's
moral
aspect
is
faithfully
revealed
to
his
*NL*
mind
's
eye
.
Not
improbably
he
had
never
before
viewed
himself
as
*NL*
he
did
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hast
thou
not
tortured
him
enough
?
''
said
Hester
,
noticing
the
*NL*
old
man
's
look
.
``
Has
he
not
paid
thee
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
He
has
but
increased
the
debt
!
''
answered
the
*NL*
physician
,
and
as
he
proceeded
,
his
manner
lost
its
fiercer
*NL*
characteristics
,
and
subsided
into
gloom
.
``
Dost
thou
remember
*NL*
me
,
Hester
,
as
I
was
nine
years
agone
?
Even
then
I
was
in
the
*NL*
autumn
of
my
days
,
nor
was
it
the
early
autumn
.
But
all
my
life
*NL*
had
been
made
up
of
earnest
,
studious
,
thoughtful
,
quiet
years
,
*NL*
bestowed
faithfully
for
the
increase
of
mine
own
knowledge
,
and
*NL*
faithfully
,
too
,
though
this
latter
object
was
but
casual
to
the
*NL*
other
--
faithfully
for
the
advancement
of
human
welfare
.
No
life
*NL*
had
been
more
peaceful
and
innocent
than
mine
;
few
lives
so
rich
*NL*
with
benefits
conferred
.
Dost
thou
remember
me
?
Was
I
not
,
*NL*
though
you
might
deem
me
cold
,
nevertheless
a
man
thoughtful
for
*NL*
others
,
craving
little
for
himself
--
kind
,
true
,
just
and
of
*NL*
constant
,
if
not
warm
affections
?
Was
I
not
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
,
and
more
,
''
said
Hester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
am
I
now
?
''
demanded
he
,
looking
into
her
face
,
and
*NL*
permitting
the
whole
evil
within
him
to
be
written
on
his
*NL*
features
.
``
I
have
already
told
thee
what
I
am
--
a
fiend
!
Who
made
*NL*
me
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
myself
,
''
cried
Hester
,
shuddering
.
``
It
was
I
,
not
less
*NL*
than
he
.
Why
hast
thou
not
avenged
thyself
on
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
left
thee
to
the
scarlet
letter
,
''
replied
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
.
``
If
that
has
not
avenged
me
,
I
can
do
no
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
his
finger
on
it
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
avenged
thee
,
''
answered
Hester
Prynne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
judged
no
less
,
''
said
the
physician
.
``
And
now
what
wouldst
*NL*
thou
with
me
touching
this
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
reveal
the
secret
,
''
answered
Hester
,
firmly
.
``
He
must
*NL*
discern
thee
in
thy
true
character
.
What
may
be
the
result
I
*NL*
know
not
.
But
this
long
debt
of
confidence
,
due
from
me
to
him
,
*NL*
whose
bane
and
ruin
I
have
been
,
shall
at
length
be
paid
.
So
far
*NL*
as
concerns
the
overthrow
or
preservation
of
his
fair
fame
and
*NL*
his
earthly
state
,
and
perchance
his
life
,
he
is
in
my
hands
.
*NL*
Nor
do
I
--
whom
the
scarlet
letter
has
disciplined
to
truth
,
*NL*
though
it
be
the
truth
of
red-hot
iron
entering
into
the
*NL*
soul
--
nor
do
I
perceive
such
advantage
in
his
living
any
longer
*NL*
a
life
of
ghastly
emptiness
,
that
I
shall
stoop
to
implore
thy
*NL*
mercy

Do
with
him
as
thou
wilt
!
There
is
no
good
for
him
,
no
*NL*
good
for
me
,
no
good
for
thee
.
There
is
no
good
for
little
*NL*
Pearl
.
There
is
no
path
to
guide
us
out
of
this
dismal
maze
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woman
,
I
could
well-nigh
pity
thee
,
''
said
Roger
Chillingworth
,
*NL*
unable
to
restrain
a
thrill
of
admiration
too
,
for
there
was
a
*NL*
quality
almost
majestic
in
the
despair
which
she
expressed
.
*NL*
``
Thou
hadst
great
elements
.
Peradventure
,
hadst
thou
met
earlier
*NL*
with
a
better
love
than
mine
,
this
evil
had
not
been
.
I
pity
*NL*
thee
,
for
the
good
that
has
been
wasted
in
thy
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
thee
,
''
answered
Hester
Prynne
,
``
for
the
hatred
that
has
*NL*
transformed
a
wise
and
just
man
to
a
fiend
!
Wilt
thou
yet
purge
*NL*
it
out
of
thee
,
and
be
once
more
human
?
If
not
for
his
sake
,
*NL*
then
doubly
for
thine
own
!
Forgive
,
and
leave
his
further
*NL*
retribution
to
the
Power
that
claims
it
!
I
said
,
but
now
,
that
*NL*
there
could
be
no
good
event
for
him
,
or
thee
,
or
me
,
who
are
*NL*
here
wandering
together
in
this
gloomy
maze
of
evil
,
and
*NL*
stumbling
at
every
step
over
the
guilt
wherewith
we
have
strewn
*NL*
our
path
.
It
is
not
so
!
There
might
be
good
for
thee
,
and
thee
*NL*
alone
,
since
thou
hast
been
deeply
wronged
and
hast
it
at
thy
*NL*
will
to
pardon
.
Wilt
thou
give
up
that
only
privilege
?
Wilt
thou
*NL*
reject
that
priceless
benefit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
,
Hester
--
peace
!
''
replied
the
old
man
,
with
gloomy
*NL*
sternness
--
``
it
is
not
granted
me
to
pardon
.
I
have
no
such
power
*NL*
as
thou
tellest
me
of
.
My
old
faith
,
long
forgotten
,
comes
back
*NL*
to
me
,
and
explains
all
that
we
do
,
and
all
we
suffer
.
By
thy
*NL*
first
step
awry
,
thou
didst
plant
the
germ
of
evil
;
but
since
*NL*
that
moment
it
has
all
been
a
dark
necessity
.
Ye
that
have
*NL*
wronged
me
are
not
sinful
,
save
in
a
kind
of
typical
illusion
;
*NL*
neither
am
I
fiend-like
,
who
have
snatched
a
fiend
's
office
from
*NL*
his
hands
.
It
is
our
fate
.
Let
the
black
flower
blossom
as
it
*NL*
may
!
Now
,
go
thy
ways
,
and
deal
as
thou
wilt
with
yonder
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waved
his
hand
,
and
betook
himself
again
to
his
employment
of
*NL*
gathering
herbs
.

HESTER
AND
PEARL
*NL*
*NL*
So
Roger
Chillingworth
--
a
deformed
old
figure
with
a
face
that
*NL*
haunted
men
's
memories
longer
than
they
liked
--
took
leave
of
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
,
and
went
stooping
away
along
the
earth
.
He
*NL*
gathered
here
and
there
a
herb
,
or
grubbed
up
a
root
and
put
it
*NL*
into
the
basket
on
his
arm
.
His
gray
beard
almost
touched
the
*NL*
ground
as
he
crept
onward
.
Hester
gazed
after
him
a
little
*NL*
while
,
looking
with
a
half
fantastic
curiosity
to
see
whether
*NL*
the
tender
grass
of
early
spring
would
not
be
blighted
beneath
*NL*
him
and
show
the
wavering
track
of
his
footsteps
,
sere
and
*NL*
brown
,
across
its
cheerful
verdure
.
She
wondered
what
sort
of
*NL*
herbs
they
were
which
the
old
man
was
so
sedulous
to
gather
.
*NL*
Would
not
the
earth
,
quickened
to
an
evil
purpose
by
the
*NL*
sympathy
of
his
eye
,
greet
him
with
poisonous
shrubs
of
species
*NL*
hitherto
unknown
,
that
would
start
up
under
his
fingers
?
Or
*NL*
might
it
suffice
him
that
every
wholesome
growth
should
be
*NL*
converted
into
something
deleterious
and
malignant
at
his
touch
?
*NL*
Did
the
sun
,
which
shone
so
brightly
everywhere
else
,
really
*NL*
fall
upon
him
?
Or
was
there
,
as
it
rather
seemed
,
a
circle
of
*NL*
ominous
shadow
moving
along
with
his
deformity
whichever
way
he
*NL*
turned
himself
?
And
whither
was
he
now
going
?
Would
he
not
*NL*
suddenly
sink
into
the
earth
,
leaving
a
barren
and
blasted
spot
,
*NL*
where
,
in
due
course
of
time
,
would
be
seen
deadly
nightshade
,
*NL*
dogwood
,
henbane
,
and
whatever
else
of
vegetable
wickedness
the
*NL*
climate
could
produce
,
all
flourishing
with
hideous
luxuriance
?
*NL*
Or
would
he
spread
bat
's
wings
and
flee
away
,
looking
so
much
*NL*
the
uglier
the
higher
he
rose
towards
heaven
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
it
sin
or
no
,
''
said
Hester
Prynne
,
bitterly
,
as
still
she
*NL*
gazed
after
him
,
``
I
hate
the
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
upbraided
herself
for
the
sentiment
,
but
could
not
overcome
*NL*
or
lessen
it
.
Attempting
to
do
so
,
she
thought
of
those
*NL*
long-past
days
in
a
distant
land
,
when
he
used
to
emerge
at
*NL*
eventide
from
the
seclusion
of
his
study
and
sit
down
in
the
*NL*
firelight
of
their
home
,
and
in
the
light
of
her
nuptial
smile
.
*NL*
He
needed
to
bask
himself
in
that
smile
,
he
said
,
in
order
that
*NL*
the
chill
of
so
many
lonely
hours
among
his
books
might
be
taken
*NL*
off
the
scholar
's
heart
.
Such
scenes
had
once
appeared
not
*NL*
otherwise
than
happy
,
but
now
,
as
viewed
through
the
dismal
*NL*
medium
of
her
subsequent
life
,
they
classed
themselves
among
her
*NL*
ugliest
remembrances
.
She
marvelled
how
such
scenes
could
have
*NL*
been
!
She
marvelled
how
she
could
ever
have
been
wrought
upon
to
*NL*
marry
him
!
She
deemed
it
her
crime
most
to
be
repented
of
,
that
*NL*
she
had
ever
endured
and
reciprocated
the
lukewarm
grasp
of
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
had
suffered
the
smile
of
her
lips
and
eyes
to
mingle
*NL*
and
melt
into
his
own
.
And
it
seemed
a
fouler
offence
committed
*NL*
by
Roger
Chillingworth
than
any
which
had
since
been
done
him
,
*NL*
that
,
in
the
time
when
her
heart
knew
no
better
,
he
had
*NL*
persuaded
her
to
fancy
herself
happy
by
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
hate
him
!
''
repeated
Hester
more
bitterly
than
before
.
*NL*
``
He
betrayed
me
!
He
has
done
me
worse
wrong
than
I
did
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Let
men
tremble
to
win
the
hand
of
woman
,
unless
they
win
along
*NL*
with
it
the
utmost
passion
of
her
heart
!
Else
it
may
be
their
*NL*
miserable
fortune
,
as
it
was
Roger
Chillingworth
's
,
when
some
*NL*
mightier
touch
than
their
own
may
have
awakened
all
her
*NL*
sensibilities
,
to
be
reproached
even
for
the
calm
content
,
the
*NL*
marble
image
of
happiness
,
which
they
will
have
imposed
upon
her
*NL*
as
the
warm
reality
.
But
Hester
ought
long
ago
to
have
done
with
*NL*
this
injustice
.
What
did
it
betoken
?
Had
seven
long
years
,
under
*NL*
the
torture
of
the
scarlet
letter
,
inflicted
so
much
of
misery
*NL*
and
wrought
out
no
repentance
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
emotion
of
that
brief
space
,
while
she
stood
gazing
after
*NL*
the
crooked
figure
of
old
Roger
Chillingworth
,
threw
a
dark
*NL*
light
on
Hester
's
state
of
mind
,
revealing
much
that
she
might
*NL*
not
otherwise
have
acknowledged
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
being
gone
,
she
summoned
back
her
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pearl
!
Little
Pearl
!
Where
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
,
whose
activity
of
spirit
never
flagged
,
had
been
at
no
*NL*
loss
for
amusement
while
her
mother
talked
with
the
old
gatherer
*NL*
of
herbs
.
At
first
,
as
already
told
,
she
had
flirted
fancifully
*NL*
with
her
own
image
in
a
pool
of
water
,
beckoning
the
phantom
*NL*
forth
,
and
--
as
it
declined
to
venture
--
seeking
a
passage
for
*NL*
herself
into
its
sphere
of
impalpable
earth
and
unattainable
*NL*
sky
.
Soon
finding
,
however
,
that
either
she
or
the
image
was
*NL*
unreal
,
she
turned
elsewhere
for
better
pastime
.
She
made
little
*NL*
boats
out
of
birch-bark
,
and
freighted
them
with
snailshells
,
*NL*
and
sent
out
more
ventures
on
the
mighty
deep
than
any
merchant
*NL*
in
New
England
;
but
the
larger
part
of
them
foundered
near
the
*NL*
shore
.
She
seized
a
live
horse-shoe
by
the
tail
,
and
made
prize
*NL*
of
several
five-fingers
,
and
laid
out
a
jelly-fish
to
melt
in
*NL*
the
warm
sun
.
Then
she
took
up
the
white
foam
that
streaked
the
*NL*
line
of
the
advancing
tide
,
and
threw
it
upon
the
breeze
,
*NL*
scampering
after
it
with
winged
footsteps
to
catch
the
great
*NL*
snowflakes
ere
they
fell
.
Perceiving
a
flock
of
beach-birds
that
*NL*
fed
and
fluttered
along
the
shore
,
the
naughty
child
picked
up
*NL*
her
apron
full
of
pebbles
,
and
,
creeping
from
rock
to
rock
after
*NL*
these
small
sea-fowl
,
displayed
remarkable
dexterity
in
pelting
*NL*
them
.
One
little
gray
bird
,
with
a
white
breast
,
Pearl
was
*NL*
almost
sure
had
been
hit
by
a
pebble
,
and
fluttered
away
with
a
*NL*
broken
wing
.
But
then
the
elf-child
sighed
,
and
gave
up
her
*NL*
sport
,
because
it
grieved
her
to
have
done
harm
to
a
little
*NL*
being
that
was
as
wild
as
the
sea-breeze
,
or
as
wild
as
Pearl
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
final
employment
was
to
gather
seaweed
of
various
kinds
,
and
*NL*
make
herself
a
scarf
or
mantle
,
and
a
head-dress
,
and
thus
*NL*
assume
the
aspect
of
a
little
mermaid
.
She
inherited
her
*NL*
mother
's
gift
for
devising
drapery
and
costume
.
As
the
last
*NL*
touch
to
her
mermaid
's
garb
,
Pearl
took
some
eel-grass
and
*NL*
imitated
,
as
best
she
could
,
on
her
own
bosom
the
decoration
*NL*
with
which
she
was
so
familiar
on
her
mother
's
.
A
letter
--
the
*NL*
letter
A
--
but
freshly
green
instead
of
scarlet
.
The
child
bent
*NL*
her
chin
upon
her
breast
,
and
contemplated
this
device
with
*NL*
strange
interest
,
even
as
if
the
one
only
thing
for
which
she
*NL*
had
been
sent
into
the
world
was
to
make
out
its
hidden
import
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
mother
will
ask
me
what
it
means
?
''
thought
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
she
heard
her
mother
's
voice
,
and
,
flitting
along
as
*NL*
lightly
as
one
of
the
little
sea-birds
,
appeared
before
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
dancing
,
laughing
,
and
pointing
her
finger
to
the
*NL*
ornament
upon
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
Pearl
,
''
said
Hester
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
``
the
*NL*
green
letter
,
and
on
thy
childish
bosom
,
has
no
purport
.
But
*NL*
dost
thou
know
,
my
child
,
what
this
letter
means
which
thy
*NL*
mother
is
doomed
to
wear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
mother
,
''
said
the
child
.
``
It
is
the
great
letter
A.
Thou
*NL*
hast
taught
me
in
the
horn-book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
looked
steadily
into
her
little
face
;
but
though
there
*NL*
was
that
singular
expression
which
she
had
so
often
remarked
in
*NL*
her
black
eyes
,
she
could
not
satisfy
herself
whether
Pearl
*NL*
really
attached
any
meaning
to
the
symbol
.
She
felt
a
morbid
*NL*
desire
to
ascertain
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
know
,
child
,
wherefore
thy
mother
wears
this
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
do
I
!
''
answered
Pearl
,
looking
brightly
into
her
mother
's
*NL*
face
.
``
It
is
for
the
same
reason
that
the
minister
keeps
his
*NL*
hand
over
his
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
reason
is
that
?
''
asked
Hester
,
half
smiling
at
the
*NL*
absurd
incongruity
of
the
child
's
observation
;
but
on
second
*NL*
thoughts
turning
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
the
letter
to
do
with
any
heart
save
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
mother
,
I
have
told
all
I
know
,
''
said
Pearl
,
more
*NL*
seriously
than
she
was
wont
to
speak
.
``
Ask
yonder
old
man
whom
*NL*
thou
hast
been
talking
with
,
--
it
may
be
he
can
tell
.
But
in
good
*NL*
earnest
now
,
mother
dear
,
what
does
this
scarlet
letter
*NL*
mean
?
--
and
why
dost
thou
wear
it
on
thy
bosom
?
--
and
why
does
the
*NL*
minister
keep
his
hand
over
his
heart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
her
mother
's
hand
in
both
her
own
,
and
gazed
into
her
*NL*
eyes
with
an
earnestness
that
was
seldom
seen
in
her
wild
and
*NL*
capricious
character
.
The
thought
occurred
to
Hester
,
that
the
*NL*
child
might
really
be
seeking
to
approach
her
with
childlike
*NL*
confidence
,
and
doing
what
she
could
,
and
as
intelligently
as
*NL*
she
knew
how
,
to
establish
a
meeting-point
of
sympathy
.
It
*NL*
showed
Pearl
in
an
unwonted
aspect
.
Heretofore
,
the
mother
,
*NL*
while
loving
her
child
with
the
intensity
of
a
sole
affection
,
*NL*
had
schooled
herself
to
hope
for
little
other
return
than
the
*NL*
waywardness
of
an
April
breeze
,
which
spends
its
time
in
airy
*NL*
sport
,
and
has
its
gusts
of
inexplicable
passion
,
and
is
*NL*
petulant
in
its
best
of
moods
,
and
chills
oftener
than
caresses
*NL*
you
,
when
you
take
it
to
your
bosom
;
in
requital
of
which
*NL*
misdemeanours
it
will
sometimes
,
of
its
own
vague
purpose
,
kiss
*NL*
your
cheek
with
a
kind
of
doubtful
tenderness
,
and
play
gently
*NL*
with
your
hair
,
and
then
be
gone
about
its
other
idle
business
,
*NL*
leaving
a
dreamy
pleasure
at
your
heart
.
And
this
,
moreover
,
was
*NL*
a
mother
's
estimate
of
the
child
's
disposition
.
Any
other
*NL*
observer
might
have
seen
few
but
unamiable
traits
,
and
have
*NL*
given
them
a
far
darker
colouring
.
But
now
the
idea
came
*NL*
strongly
into
Hester
's
mind
,
that
Pearl
,
with
her
remarkable
*NL*
precocity
and
acuteness
,
might
already
have
approached
the
age
*NL*
when
she
could
have
been
made
a
friend
,
and
intrusted
with
as
*NL*
much
of
her
mother
's
sorrows
as
could
be
imparted
,
without
*NL*
irreverence
either
to
the
parent
or
the
child
.
In
the
little
*NL*
chaos
of
Pearl
's
character
there
might
be
seen
emerging
and
*NL*
could
have
been
from
the
very
first
--
the
steadfast
principles
of
*NL*
an
unflinching
courage
--
an
uncontrollable
will
--
sturdy
pride
,
*NL*
which
might
be
disciplined
into
self-respect
--
and
a
bitter
scorn
*NL*
of
many
things
which
,
when
examined
,
might
be
found
to
have
the
*NL*
taint
of
falsehood
in
them
.
She
possessed
affections
,
too
,
*NL*
though
hitherto
acrid
and
disagreeable
,
as
are
the
richest
*NL*
flavours
of
unripe
fruit
.
With
all
these
sterling
attributes
,
*NL*
thought
Hester
,
the
evil
which
she
inherited
from
her
mother
*NL*
must
be
great
indeed
,
if
a
noble
woman
do
not
grow
out
of
this
*NL*
elfish
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
's
inevitable
tendency
to
hover
about
the
enigma
of
the
*NL*
scarlet
letter
seemed
an
innate
quality
of
her
being
.
From
the
*NL*
earliest
epoch
of
her
conscious
life
,
she
had
entered
upon
this
*NL*
as
her
appointed
mission
.
Hester
had
often
fancied
that
*NL*
Providence
had
a
design
of
justice
and
retribution
,
in
endowing
*NL*
the
child
with
this
marked
propensity
;
but
never
,
until
now
,
had
*NL*
she
bethought
herself
to
ask
,
whether
,
linked
with
that
design
,
*NL*
there
might
not
likewise
be
a
purpose
of
mercy
and
beneficence
.
*NL*
If
little
Pearl
were
entertained
with
faith
and
trust
,
as
a
*NL*
spirit
messenger
no
less
than
an
earthly
child
,
might
it
not
be
*NL*
her
errand
to
soothe
away
the
sorrow
that
lay
cold
in
her
*NL*
mother
's
heart
,
and
converted
it
into
a
tomb
?
--
and
to
help
her
*NL*
to
overcome
the
passion
,
once
so
wild
,
and
even
yet
neither
dead
*NL*
nor
asleep
,
but
only
imprisoned
within
the
same
tomb-like
heart
?
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
some
of
the
thoughts
that
now
stirred
in
Hester
's
*NL*
mind
,
with
as
much
vivacity
of
impression
as
if
they
had
*NL*
actually
been
whispered
into
her
ear
.
And
there
was
little
*NL*
Pearl
,
all
this
while
,
holding
her
mother
's
hand
in
both
her
*NL*
own
,
and
turning
her
face
upward
,
while
she
put
these
searching
*NL*
questions
,
once
and
again
,
and
still
a
third
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
the
letter
mean
,
mother
?
and
why
dost
thou
wear
it
?
*NL*
and
why
does
the
minister
keep
his
hand
over
his
heart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
say
?
''
thought
Hester
to
herself
.
``
No
!
if
this
be
*NL*
the
price
of
the
child
's
sympathy
,
I
can
not
pay
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
spoke
aloud
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silly
Pearl
,
''
said
she
,
``
what
questions
are
these
?
There
are
*NL*
many
things
in
this
world
that
a
child
must
not
ask
about
.
What
*NL*
know
I
of
the
minister
's
heart
?
And
as
for
the
scarlet
letter
,
I
*NL*
wear
it
for
the
sake
of
its
gold
thread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
the
seven
bygone
years
,
Hester
Prynne
had
never
before
*NL*
been
false
to
the
symbol
on
her
bosom
.
It
may
be
that
it
was
the
*NL*
talisman
of
a
stern
and
severe
,
but
yet
a
guardian
spirit
,
who
*NL*
now
forsook
her
;
as
recognising
that
,
in
spite
of
his
strict
*NL*
watch
over
her
heart
,
some
new
evil
had
crept
into
it
,
or
some
*NL*
old
one
had
never
been
expelled
.
As
for
little
Pearl
,
the
*NL*
earnestness
soon
passed
out
of
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
child
did
not
see
fit
to
let
the
matter
drop
.
Two
or
*NL*
three
times
,
as
her
mother
and
she
went
homeward
,
and
as
often
*NL*
at
supper-time
,
and
while
Hester
was
putting
her
to
bed
,
and
*NL*
once
after
she
seemed
to
be
fairly
asleep
,
Pearl
looked
up
,
with
*NL*
mischief
gleaming
in
her
black
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
said
she
,
``
what
does
the
scarlet
letter
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
next
morning
,
the
first
indication
the
child
gave
of
*NL*
being
awake
was
by
popping
up
her
head
from
the
pillow
,
and
*NL*
making
that
other
enquiry
,
which
she
had
so
unaccountably
*NL*
connected
with
her
investigations
about
the
scarlet
letter
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
--
Mother
!
--
Why
does
the
minister
keep
his
hand
over
his
*NL*
heart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
thy
tongue
,
naughty
child
!
''
answered
her
mother
,
with
an
*NL*
asperity
that
she
had
never
permitted
to
herself
before
.
``
Do
not
*NL*
tease
me
;
else
I
shall
put
thee
into
the
dark
closet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XVI
.
A
FOREST
WALK
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
remained
constant
in
her
resolve
to
make
known
to
*NL*
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
at
whatever
risk
of
present
pain
or
ulterior
*NL*
consequences
,
the
true
character
of
the
man
who
had
crept
into
*NL*
his
intimacy
.
For
several
days
,
however
,
she
vainly
sought
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
addressing
him
in
some
of
the
meditative
walks
*NL*
which
she
knew
him
to
be
in
the
habit
of
taking
along
the
shores
*NL*
of
the
Peninsula
,
or
on
the
wooded
hills
of
the
neighbouring
*NL*
country
.
There
would
have
been
no
scandal
,
indeed
,
nor
peril
to
*NL*
the
holy
whiteness
of
the
clergyman
's
good
fame
,
had
she
visited
*NL*
him
in
his
own
study
,
where
many
a
penitent
,
ere
now
,
had
*NL*
confessed
sins
of
perhaps
as
deep
a
dye
as
the
one
betokened
by
*NL*
the
scarlet
letter
.
But
,
partly
that
she
dreaded
the
secret
or
*NL*
undisguised
interference
of
old
Roger
Chillingworth
,
and
partly
*NL*
that
her
conscious
heart
imparted
suspicion
where
none
could
*NL*
have
been
felt
,
and
partly
that
both
the
minister
and
she
would
*NL*
need
the
whole
wide
world
to
breathe
in
,
while
they
talked
*NL*
together
--
for
all
these
reasons
Hester
never
thought
of
meeting
*NL*
him
in
any
narrower
privacy
than
beneath
the
open
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
while
attending
a
sick
chamber
,
whither
the
Rev.
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
had
been
summoned
to
make
a
prayer
,
she
learnt
that
*NL*
he
had
gone
,
the
day
before
,
to
visit
the
Apostle
Eliot
,
among
*NL*
his
Indian
converts
.
He
would
probably
return
by
a
certain
hour
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
of
the
morrow
.
Betimes
,
therefore
,
the
next
*NL*
day
,
Hester
took
little
Pearl
--
who
was
necessarily
the
companion
*NL*
of
all
her
mother
's
expeditions
,
however
inconvenient
her
*NL*
presence
--
and
set
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
road
,
after
the
two
wayfarers
had
crossed
from
the
Peninsula
*NL*
to
the
mainland
,
was
no
other
than
a
foot-path
.
It
straggled
*NL*
onward
into
the
mystery
of
the
primeval
forest
.
This
hemmed
it
*NL*
in
so
narrowly
,
and
stood
so
black
and
dense
on
either
side
,
and
*NL*
disclosed
such
imperfect
glimpses
of
the
sky
above
,
that
,
to
*NL*
Hester
's
mind
,
it
imaged
not
amiss
the
moral
wilderness
in
which
*NL*
she
had
so
long
been
wandering
.
The
day
was
chill
and
sombre
.
*NL*
Overhead
was
a
gray
expanse
of
cloud
,
slightly
stirred
,
however
,
*NL*
by
a
breeze
;
so
that
a
gleam
of
flickering
sunshine
might
now
*NL*
and
then
be
seen
at
its
solitary
play
along
the
path
.
This
*NL*
flitting
cheerfulness
was
always
at
the
further
extremity
of
*NL*
some
long
vista
through
the
forest
.
The
sportive
*NL*
sunlight
--
feebly
sportive
,
at
best
,
in
the
predominant
*NL*
pensiveness
of
the
day
and
scene
--
withdrew
itself
as
they
came
*NL*
nigh
,
and
left
the
spots
where
it
had
danced
the
drearier
,
*NL*
because
they
had
hoped
to
find
them
bright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
said
little
Pearl
,
``
the
sunshine
does
not
love
you
.
*NL*
It
runs
away
and
hides
itself
,
because
it
is
afraid
of
something
*NL*
on
your
bosom
.
Now
,
see
!
There
it
is
,
playing
a
good
way
off
.
*NL*
Stand
you
here
,
and
let
me
run
and
catch
it
.
I
am
but
a
child
.
*NL*
It
will
not
flee
from
me
--
for
I
wear
nothing
on
my
bosom
yet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
ever
will
,
my
child
,
I
hope
,
''
said
Hester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
,
mother
?
''
asked
Pearl
,
stopping
short
,
just
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
her
race
.
``
Will
not
it
come
of
its
own
accord
when
*NL*
I
am
a
woman
grown
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
away
,
child
,
''
answered
her
mother
,
``
and
catch
the
sunshine
.
*NL*
It
will
soon
be
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
set
forth
at
a
great
pace
,
and
as
Hester
smiled
to
*NL*
perceive
,
did
actually
catch
the
sunshine
,
and
stood
laughing
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
it
,
all
brightened
by
its
splendour
,
and
*NL*
scintillating
with
the
vivacity
excited
by
rapid
motion
.
The
*NL*
light
lingered
about
the
lonely
child
,
as
if
glad
of
such
a
*NL*
playmate
,
until
her
mother
had
drawn
almost
nigh
enough
to
step
*NL*
into
the
magic
circle
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
go
now
,
''
said
Pearl
,
shaking
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
!
''
answered
Hester
,
smiling
;
``
now
I
can
stretch
out
my
hand
*NL*
and
grasp
some
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
attempted
to
do
so
,
the
sunshine
vanished
;
or
,
to
judge
*NL*
from
the
bright
expression
that
was
dancing
on
Pearl
's
features
,
*NL*
her
mother
could
have
fancied
that
the
child
had
absorbed
it
*NL*
into
herself
,
and
would
give
it
forth
again
,
with
a
gleam
about
*NL*
her
path
,
as
they
should
plunge
into
some
gloomier
shade
.
There
*NL*
was
no
other
attribute
that
so
much
impressed
her
with
a
sense
*NL*
of
new
and
untransmitted
vigour
in
Pearl
's
nature
,
as
this
never
*NL*
failing
vivacity
of
spirits
:
she
had
not
the
disease
of
sadness
,
*NL*
which
almost
all
children
,
in
these
latter
days
,
inherit
,
with
*NL*
the
scrofula
,
from
the
troubles
of
their
ancestors
.
Perhaps
*NL*
this
,
too
,
was
a
disease
,
and
but
the
reflex
of
the
wild
energy
*NL*
with
which
Hester
had
fought
against
her
sorrows
before
Pearl
's
*NL*
birth
.
It
was
certainly
a
doubtful
charm
,
imparting
a
hard
,
*NL*
metallic
lustre
to
the
child
's
character
.
She
wanted
--
what
some
*NL*
people
want
throughout
life
--
a
grief
that
should
deeply
touch
*NL*
her
,
and
thus
humanise
and
make
her
capable
of
sympathy
.
But
*NL*
there
was
time
enough
yet
for
little
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
child
!
''
said
Hester
,
looking
about
her
from
the
spot
*NL*
where
Pearl
had
stood
still
in
the
sunshine
--
``
we
will
sit
down
a
*NL*
little
way
within
the
wood
,
and
rest
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
aweary
,
mother
,
''
replied
the
little
girl
.
``
But
you
*NL*
may
sit
down
,
if
you
will
tell
me
a
story
meanwhile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
story
,
child
!
''
said
Hester
.
``
And
about
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
a
story
about
the
Black
Man
,
''
answered
Pearl
,
taking
hold
*NL*
of
her
mother
's
gown
,
and
looking
up
,
half
earnestly
,
half
*NL*
mischievously
,
into
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
he
haunts
this
forest
,
and
carries
a
book
with
him
a
big
,
*NL*
heavy
book
,
with
iron
clasps
;
and
how
this
ugly
Black
Man
offers
*NL*
his
book
and
an
iron
pen
to
everybody
that
meets
him
here
among
*NL*
the
trees
;
and
they
are
to
write
their
names
with
their
own
*NL*
blood
;
and
then
he
sets
his
mark
on
their
bosoms
.
Didst
thou
*NL*
ever
meet
the
Black
Man
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
told
you
this
story
,
Pearl
,
''
asked
her
mother
,
*NL*
recognising
a
common
superstition
of
the
period
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
old
dame
in
the
chimney
corner
,
at
the
house
where
*NL*
you
watched
last
night
,
''
said
the
child
.
``
But
she
fancied
me
*NL*
asleep
while
she
was
talking
of
it
.
She
said
that
a
thousand
and
*NL*
a
thousand
people
had
met
him
here
,
and
had
written
in
his
book
,
*NL*
and
have
his
mark
on
them
.
And
that
ugly
tempered
lady
,
old
*NL*
Mistress
Hibbins
,
was
one
.
And
,
mother
,
the
old
dame
said
that
*NL*
this
scarlet
letter
was
the
Black
Man
's
mark
on
thee
,
and
that
*NL*
it
glows
like
a
red
flame
when
thou
meetest
him
at
midnight
,
*NL*
here
in
the
dark
wood
.
Is
it
true
,
mother
?
And
dost
thou
go
to
*NL*
meet
him
in
the
nighttime
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Didst
thou
ever
awake
and
find
thy
mother
gone
?
''
asked
Hester
.
*NL*
``
Not
that
I
remember
,
''
said
the
child
.
``
If
thou
fearest
to
leave
*NL*
me
in
our
cottage
,
thou
mightest
take
me
along
with
thee
.
I
*NL*
would
very
gladly
go
!
But
,
mother
,
tell
me
now
!
Is
there
such
a
*NL*
Black
Man
?
And
didst
thou
ever
meet
him
?
And
is
this
his
mark
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wilt
thou
let
me
be
at
peace
,
if
I
once
tell
thee
?
''
asked
her
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
thou
tellest
me
all
,
''
answered
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
in
my
life
I
met
the
Black
Man
!
''
said
her
mother
.
``
This
*NL*
scarlet
letter
is
his
mark
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
conversing
,
they
entered
sufficiently
deep
into
the
wood
to
*NL*
secure
themselves
from
the
observation
of
any
casual
passenger
*NL*
along
the
forest
track
.
Here
they
sat
down
on
a
luxuriant
heap
*NL*
of
moss
;
which
at
some
epoch
of
the
preceding
century
,
had
been
*NL*
a
gigantic
pine
,
with
its
roots
and
trunk
in
the
darksome
shade
,
*NL*
and
its
head
aloft
in
the
upper
atmosphere
.
It
was
a
little
dell
*NL*
where
they
had
seated
themselves
,
with
a
leaf-strewn
bank
rising
*NL*
gently
on
either
side
,
and
a
brook
flowing
through
the
midst
,
*NL*
over
a
bed
of
fallen
and
drowned
leaves
.
The
trees
impending
*NL*
over
it
had
flung
down
great
branches
from
time
to
time
,
which
*NL*
choked
up
the
current
,
and
compelled
it
to
form
eddies
and
black
*NL*
depths
at
some
points
;
while
,
in
its
swifter
and
livelier
*NL*
passages
there
appeared
a
channel-way
of
pebbles
,
and
brown
,
*NL*
sparkling
sand
.
Letting
the
eyes
follow
along
the
course
of
the
*NL*
stream
,
they
could
catch
the
reflected
light
from
its
water
,
at
*NL*
some
short
distance
within
the
forest
,
but
soon
lost
all
traces
*NL*
of
it
amid
the
bewilderment
of
tree-trunks
and
underbrush
,
and
*NL*
here
and
there
a
huge
rock
covered
over
with
gray
lichens
.
All
*NL*
these
giant
trees
and
boulders
of
granite
seemed
intent
on
*NL*
making
a
mystery
of
the
course
of
this
small
brook
;
fearing
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
that
,
with
its
never-ceasing
loquacity
,
it
should
*NL*
whisper
tales
out
of
the
heart
of
the
old
forest
whence
it
*NL*
flowed
,
or
mirror
its
revelations
on
the
smooth
surface
of
a
*NL*
pool
.
Continually
,
indeed
,
as
it
stole
onward
,
the
streamlet
*NL*
kept
up
a
babble
,
kind
,
quiet
,
soothing
,
but
melancholy
,
like
*NL*
the
voice
of
a
young
child
that
was
spending
its
infancy
without
*NL*
playfulness
,
and
knew
not
how
to
be
merry
among
sad
acquaintance
*NL*
and
events
of
sombre
hue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
brook
!
Oh
,
foolish
and
tiresome
little
brook
!
''
cried
*NL*
Pearl
,
after
listening
awhile
to
its
talk
,
``
Why
art
thou
so
sad
?
*NL*
Pluck
up
a
spirit
,
and
do
not
be
all
the
time
sighing
and
*NL*
murmuring
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
brook
,
in
the
course
of
its
little
lifetime
among
the
*NL*
forest
trees
,
had
gone
through
so
solemn
an
experience
that
it
*NL*
could
not
help
talking
about
it
,
and
seemed
to
have
nothing
else
*NL*
to
say
.
Pearl
resembled
the
brook
,
inasmuch
as
the
current
of
*NL*
her
life
gushed
from
a
well-spring
as
mysterious
,
and
had
flowed
*NL*
through
scenes
shadowed
as
heavily
with
gloom
.
But
,
unlike
the
*NL*
little
stream
,
she
danced
and
sparkled
,
and
prattled
airily
*NL*
along
her
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
sad
little
brook
say
,
mother
?
''
inquired
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
thou
hadst
a
sorrow
of
thine
own
,
the
brook
might
tell
thee
*NL*
of
it
,
''
answered
her
mother
,
``
even
as
it
is
telling
me
of
mine
.
*NL*
But
now
,
Pearl
,
I
hear
a
footstep
along
the
path
,
and
the
noise
*NL*
of
one
putting
aside
the
branches
.
I
would
have
thee
betake
*NL*
thyself
to
play
,
and
leave
me
to
speak
with
him
that
comes
*NL*
yonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
the
Black
Man
?
''
asked
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wilt
thou
go
and
play
,
child
?
''
repeated
her
mother
,
``
But
do
not
*NL*
stray
far
into
the
wood
.
And
take
heed
that
thou
come
at
my
*NL*
first
call
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
mother
,
''
answered
Pearl
,
``
But
if
it
be
the
Black
Man
,
wilt
*NL*
thou
not
let
me
stay
a
moment
,
and
look
at
him
,
with
his
big
*NL*
book
under
his
arm
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
silly
child
!
''
said
her
mother
impatiently
.
``
It
is
no
Black
*NL*
Man
!
Thou
canst
see
him
now
,
through
the
trees
.
It
is
the
*NL*
minister
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
it
is
!
''
said
the
child
.
``
And
,
mother
,
he
has
his
hand
*NL*
over
his
heart
!
Is
it
because
,
when
the
minister
wrote
his
name
*NL*
in
the
book
,
the
Black
Man
set
his
mark
in
that
place
?
But
why
*NL*
does
he
not
wear
it
outside
his
bosom
,
as
thou
dost
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
now
,
child
,
and
thou
shalt
tease
me
as
thou
wilt
another
*NL*
time
,
''
cried
Hester
Prynne
.
``
But
do
not
stray
far
.
Keep
where
*NL*
thou
canst
hear
the
babble
of
the
brook
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
went
singing
away
,
following
up
the
current
of
the
*NL*
brook
,
and
striving
to
mingle
a
more
lightsome
cadence
with
its
*NL*
melancholy
voice
.
But
the
little
stream
would
not
be
comforted
,
*NL*
and
still
kept
telling
its
unintelligible
secret
of
some
very
*NL*
mournful
mystery
that
had
happened
--
or
making
a
prophetic
*NL*
lamentation
about
something
that
was
yet
to
happen
--
within
the
*NL*
verge
of
the
dismal
forest
.
So
Pearl
,
who
had
enough
of
shadow
*NL*
in
her
own
little
life
,
chose
to
break
off
all
acquaintance
with
*NL*
this
repining
brook
.
She
set
herself
,
therefore
,
to
gathering
*NL*
violets
and
wood-anemones
,
and
some
scarlet
columbines
that
she
*NL*
found
growing
in
the
crevice
of
a
high
rock
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
elf-child
had
departed
,
Hester
Prynne
made
a
step
or
*NL*
two
towards
the
track
that
led
through
the
forest
,
but
still
*NL*
remained
under
the
deep
shadow
of
the
trees
.
She
beheld
the
*NL*
minister
advancing
along
the
path
entirely
alone
,
and
leaning
on
*NL*
a
staff
which
he
had
cut
by
the
wayside
.
He
looked
haggard
and
*NL*
feeble
,
and
betrayed
a
nerveless
despondency
in
his
air
,
which
*NL*
had
never
so
remarkably
characterised
him
in
his
walks
about
the
*NL*
settlement
,
nor
in
any
other
situation
where
he
deemed
himself
*NL*
liable
to
notice
.
Here
it
was
wofully
visible
,
in
this
intense
*NL*
seclusion
of
the
forest
,
which
of
itself
would
have
been
a
heavy
*NL*
trial
to
the
spirits
.
There
was
a
listlessness
in
his
gait
,
as
*NL*
if
he
saw
no
reason
for
taking
one
step
further
,
nor
felt
any
*NL*
desire
to
do
so
,
but
would
have
been
glad
,
could
he
be
glad
of
*NL*
anything
,
to
fling
himself
down
at
the
root
of
the
nearest
tree
,
*NL*
and
lie
there
passive
for
evermore
.
The
leaves
might
bestrew
*NL*
him
,
and
the
soil
gradually
accumulate
and
form
a
little
hillock
*NL*
over
his
frame
,
no
matter
whether
there
were
life
in
it
or
no
.
*NL*
Death
was
too
definite
an
object
to
be
wished
for
or
avoided
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Hester
's
eye
,
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
exhibited
no
*NL*
symptom
of
positive
and
vivacious
suffering
,
except
that
,
as
*NL*
little
Pearl
had
remarked
,
he
kept
his
hand
over
his
heart
.

THE
PASTOR
AND
HIS
PARISHIONER
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
as
the
minister
walked
,
he
had
almost
gone
by
before
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
could
gather
voice
enough
to
attract
his
*NL*
observation
.
At
length
she
succeeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arthur
Dimmesdale
!
''
she
said
,
faintly
at
first
,
then
louder
,
*NL*
but
hoarsely
--
``
Arthur
Dimmesdale
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
speaks
?
''
answered
the
minister
.
Gathering
himself
quickly
*NL*
up
,
he
stood
more
erect
,
like
a
man
taken
by
surprise
in
a
mood
*NL*
to
which
he
was
reluctant
to
have
witnesses
.
Throwing
his
eyes
*NL*
anxiously
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
,
he
indistinctly
beheld
*NL*
a
form
under
the
trees
,
clad
in
garments
so
sombre
,
and
so
*NL*
little
relieved
from
the
gray
twilight
into
which
the
clouded
*NL*
sky
and
the
heavy
foliage
had
darkened
the
noontide
,
that
he
*NL*
knew
not
whether
it
were
a
woman
or
a
shadow
.
It
may
be
that
his
*NL*
pathway
through
life
was
haunted
thus
by
a
spectre
that
had
*NL*
stolen
out
from
among
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
step
nigher
,
and
discovered
the
scarlet
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hester
!
Hester
Prynne
!
''
,
said
he
;
``
is
it
thou
?
Art
thou
in
*NL*
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
.
''
she
answered
.
``
In
such
life
as
has
been
mine
these
*NL*
seven
years
past
!
And
thou
,
Arthur
Dimmesdale
,
dost
thou
yet
*NL*
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
wonder
that
they
thus
questioned
one
another
's
actual
*NL*
and
bodily
existence
,
and
even
doubted
of
their
own
.
So
*NL*
strangely
did
they
meet
in
the
dim
wood
that
it
was
like
the
*NL*
first
encounter
in
the
world
beyond
the
grave
of
two
spirits
who
*NL*
had
been
intimately
connected
in
their
former
life
,
but
now
*NL*
stood
coldly
shuddering
in
mutual
dread
,
as
not
yet
familiar
*NL*
with
their
state
,
nor
wonted
to
the
companionship
of
disembodied
*NL*
beings
.
Each
a
ghost
,
and
awe-stricken
at
the
other
ghost
.
They
*NL*
were
awe-stricken
likewise
at
themselves
,
because
the
crisis
*NL*
flung
back
to
them
their
consciousness
,
and
revealed
to
each
*NL*
heart
its
history
and
experience
,
as
life
never
does
,
except
at
*NL*
such
breathless
epochs
.
The
soul
beheld
its
features
in
the
*NL*
mirror
of
the
passing
moment
.
It
was
with
fear
,
and
tremulously
,
*NL*
and
,
as
it
were
,
by
a
slow
,
reluctant
necessity
,
that
Arthur
*NL*
Dimmesdale
put
forth
his
hand
,
chill
as
death
,
and
touched
the
*NL*
chill
hand
of
Hester
Prynne
.
The
grasp
,
cold
as
it
was
,
took
*NL*
away
what
was
dreariest
in
the
interview
.
They
now
felt
*NL*
themselves
,
at
least
,
inhabitants
of
the
same
sphere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
a
word
more
spoken
--
neither
he
nor
she
assuming
the
*NL*
guidance
,
but
with
an
unexpressed
consent
--
they
glided
back
into
*NL*
the
shadow
of
the
woods
whence
Hester
had
emerged
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
on
the
heap
of
moss
where
she
and
Pearl
had
before
been
sitting
.
*NL*
When
they
found
voice
to
speak
,
it
was
at
first
only
to
utter
*NL*
remarks
and
inquiries
such
as
any
two
acquaintances
might
have
*NL*
made
,
about
the
gloomy
sky
,
the
threatening
storm
,
and
,
next
,
*NL*
the
health
of
each
.
Thus
they
went
onward
,
not
boldly
,
but
step
*NL*
by
step
,
into
the
themes
that
were
brooding
deepest
in
their
*NL*
hearts
.
So
long
estranged
by
fate
and
circumstances
,
they
needed
*NL*
something
slight
and
casual
to
run
before
and
throw
open
the
*NL*
doors
of
intercourse
,
so
that
their
real
thoughts
might
be
led
*NL*
across
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
awhile
,
the
minister
fixed
his
eyes
on
Hester
Prynne
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hester
,
''
said
he
,
``
hast
thou
found
peace
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
drearily
,
looking
down
upon
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hast
thou
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
--
nothing
but
despair
!
''
he
answered
.
``
What
else
could
I
*NL*
look
for
,
being
what
I
am
,
and
leading
such
a
life
as
mine
?
Were
*NL*
I
an
atheist
--
a
man
devoid
of
conscience
--
a
wretch
with
coarse
*NL*
and
brutal
instincts
--
I
might
have
found
peace
long
ere
now
.
*NL*
Nay
,
I
never
should
have
lost
it
.
But
,
as
matters
stand
with
my
*NL*
soul
,
whatever
of
good
capacity
there
originally
was
in
me
,
all
*NL*
of
God
's
gifts
that
were
the
choicest
have
become
the
ministers
*NL*
of
spiritual
torment
.
Hester
,
I
am
most
miserable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
people
reverence
thee
,
''
said
Hester
.
``
And
surely
thou
*NL*
workest
good
among
them
!
Doth
this
bring
thee
no
comfort
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
misery
,
Hester
!
--
Only
the
more
misery
!
''
answered
the
*NL*
clergyman
with
a
bitter
smile
.
``
As
concerns
the
good
which
I
may
*NL*
appear
to
do
,
I
have
no
faith
in
it
.
It
must
needs
be
a
*NL*
delusion
.
What
can
a
ruined
soul
like
mine
effect
towards
the
*NL*
redemption
of
other
souls
?
--
or
a
polluted
soul
towards
their
*NL*
purification
?
And
as
for
the
people
's
reverence
,
would
that
it
*NL*
were
turned
to
scorn
and
hatred
!
Canst
thou
deem
it
,
Hester
,
a
*NL*
consolation
that
I
must
stand
up
in
my
pulpit
,
and
meet
so
many
*NL*
eyes
turned
upward
to
my
face
,
as
if
the
light
of
heaven
were
*NL*
beaming
from
it
!
--
must
see
my
flock
hungry
for
the
truth
,
and
*NL*
listening
to
my
words
as
if
a
tongue
of
Pentecost
were
*NL*
speaking
!
--
and
then
look
inward
,
and
discern
the
black
reality
*NL*
of
what
they
idolise
?
I
have
laughed
,
in
bitterness
and
agony
of
*NL*
heart
,
at
the
contrast
between
what
I
seem
and
what
I
am
!
And
*NL*
Satan
laughs
at
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wrong
yourself
in
this
,
''
said
Hester
gently
.
``
You
have
*NL*
deeply
and
sorely
repented
.
Your
sin
is
left
behind
you
in
the
*NL*
days
long
past
.
Your
present
life
is
not
less
holy
,
in
very
*NL*
truth
,
than
it
seems
in
people
's
eyes
.
Is
there
no
reality
in
*NL*
the
penitence
thus
sealed
and
witnessed
by
good
works
?
And
*NL*
wherefore
should
it
not
bring
you
peace
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Hester
--
no
!
''
replied
the
clergyman
.
``
There
is
no
substance
*NL*
in
it
!
It
is
cold
and
dead
,
and
can
do
nothing
for
me
!
Of
*NL*
penance
,
I
have
had
enough
!
Of
penitence
,
there
has
been
none
!
*NL*
Else
,
I
should
long
ago
have
thrown
off
these
garments
of
mock
*NL*
holiness
,
and
have
shown
myself
to
mankind
as
they
will
see
me
*NL*
at
the
judgment-seat
.
Happy
are
you
,
Hester
,
that
wear
the
*NL*
scarlet
letter
openly
upon
your
bosom
!
Mine
burns
in
secret
!
*NL*
Thou
little
knowest
what
a
relief
it
is
,
after
the
torment
of
a
*NL*
seven
years
'
cheat
,
to
look
into
an
eye
that
recognises
me
for
*NL*
what
I
am
!
Had
I
one
friend
--
or
were
it
my
worst
enemy
!
--
to
*NL*
whom
,
when
sickened
with
the
praises
of
all
other
men
,
I
could
*NL*
daily
betake
myself
,
and
be
known
as
the
vilest
of
all
sinners
,
*NL*
methinks
my
soul
might
keep
itself
alive
thereby
.
Even
thus
much
*NL*
of
truth
would
save
me
!
But
now
,
it
is
all
falsehood
!
--
all
*NL*
emptiness
!
--
all
death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
looked
into
his
face
,
but
hesitated
to
speak
.
*NL*
Yet
,
uttering
his
long-restrained
emotions
so
vehemently
as
he
*NL*
did
,
his
words
here
offered
her
the
very
point
of
circumstances
*NL*
in
which
to
interpose
what
she
came
to
say
.
She
conquered
her
*NL*
fears
,
and
spoke
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
friend
as
thou
hast
even
now
wished
for
,
''
said
she
,
*NL*
``
with
whom
to
weep
over
thy
sin
,
thou
hast
in
me
,
the
partner
of
*NL*
it
!
''
Again
she
hesitated
,
but
brought
out
the
words
with
an
*NL*
effort
.
--
``
Thou
hast
long
had
such
an
enemy
,
and
dwellest
with
*NL*
him
,
under
the
same
roof
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
started
to
his
feet
,
gasping
for
breath
,
and
*NL*
clutching
at
his
heart
,
as
if
he
would
have
torn
it
out
of
his
*NL*
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
What
sayest
thou
?
''
cried
he
.
``
An
enemy
!
And
under
mine
*NL*
own
roof
!
What
mean
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
was
now
fully
sensible
of
the
deep
injury
for
*NL*
which
she
was
responsible
to
this
unhappy
man
,
in
permitting
him
*NL*
to
lie
for
so
many
years
,
or
,
indeed
,
for
a
single
moment
,
at
*NL*
the
mercy
of
one
whose
purposes
could
not
be
other
than
*NL*
malevolent
.
The
very
contiguity
of
his
enemy
,
beneath
whatever
*NL*
mask
the
latter
might
conceal
himself
,
was
enough
to
disturb
the
*NL*
magnetic
sphere
of
a
being
so
sensitive
as
Arthur
Dimmesdale
.
*NL*
There
had
been
a
period
when
Hester
was
less
alive
to
this
*NL*
consideration
;
or
,
perhaps
,
in
the
misanthropy
of
her
own
*NL*
trouble
,
she
left
the
minister
to
bear
what
she
might
picture
to
*NL*
herself
as
a
more
tolerable
doom
.
But
of
late
,
since
the
night
*NL*
of
his
vigil
,
all
her
sympathies
towards
him
had
been
both
*NL*
softened
and
invigorated
.
She
now
read
his
heart
more
*NL*
accurately
.
She
doubted
not
that
the
continual
presence
of
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
--
the
secret
poison
of
his
malignity
,
infecting
all
*NL*
the
air
about
him
--
and
his
authorised
interference
,
as
a
*NL*
physician
,
with
the
minister
's
physical
and
spiritual
*NL*
infirmities
--
that
these
bad
opportunities
had
been
turned
to
a
*NL*
cruel
purpose
.
By
means
of
them
,
the
sufferer
's
conscience
had
*NL*
been
kept
in
an
irritated
state
,
the
tendency
of
which
was
,
not
*NL*
to
cure
by
wholesome
pain
,
but
to
disorganize
and
corrupt
his
*NL*
spiritual
being
.
Its
result
,
on
earth
,
could
hardly
fail
to
be
*NL*
insanity
,
and
hereafter
,
that
eternal
alienation
from
the
Good
*NL*
and
True
,
of
which
madness
is
perhaps
the
earthly
type
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
ruin
to
which
she
had
brought
the
man
,
once
--
nay
,
*NL*
why
should
we
not
speak
it
?
--
still
so
passionately
loved
!
Hester
*NL*
felt
that
the
sacrifice
of
the
clergyman
's
good
name
,
and
death
*NL*
itself
,
as
she
had
already
told
Roger
Chillingworth
,
would
have
*NL*
been
infinitely
preferable
to
the
alternative
which
she
had
*NL*
taken
upon
herself
to
choose
.
And
now
,
rather
than
have
had
this
*NL*
grievous
wrong
to
confess
,
she
would
gladly
have
laid
down
on
*NL*
the
forest
leaves
,
and
died
there
,
at
Arthur
Dimmesdale
's
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Arthur
!
''
cried
she
,
``
forgive
me
!
In
all
things
else
,
I
*NL*
have
striven
to
be
true
!
Truth
was
the
one
virtue
which
I
might
*NL*
have
held
fast
,
and
did
hold
fast
,
through
all
extremity
;
save
*NL*
when
thy
good
--
thy
life
--
thy
fame
--
were
put
in
question
!
Then
I
*NL*
consented
to
a
deception
.
But
a
lie
is
never
good
,
even
though
*NL*
death
threaten
on
the
other
side
!
Dost
thou
not
see
what
I
would
*NL*
say
?
That
old
man
!
--
the
physician
!
--
he
whom
they
call
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
!
--
he
was
my
husband
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
,
with
all
that
*NL*
violence
of
passion
,
which
--
intermixed
in
more
shapes
than
one
*NL*
with
his
higher
,
purer
,
softer
qualities
--
was
,
in
fact
,
the
*NL*
portion
of
him
which
the
devil
claimed
,
and
through
which
he
*NL*
sought
to
win
the
rest
.
Never
was
there
a
blacker
or
a
fiercer
*NL*
frown
than
Hester
now
encountered
.
For
the
brief
space
that
it
*NL*
lasted
,
it
was
a
dark
transfiguration
.
But
his
character
had
*NL*
been
so
much
enfeebled
by
suffering
,
that
even
its
lower
*NL*
energies
were
incapable
of
more
than
a
temporary
struggle
.
He
*NL*
sank
down
on
the
ground
,
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
have
known
it
,
''
murmured
he
--
``
I
did
know
it
!
Was
not
*NL*
the
secret
told
me
,
in
the
natural
recoil
of
my
heart
at
the
*NL*
first
sight
of
him
,
and
as
often
as
I
have
seen
him
since
?
Why
*NL*
did
I
not
understand
?
Oh
,
Hester
Prynne
,
thou
little
,
little
*NL*
knowest
all
the
horror
of
this
thing
!
And
the
shame
!
--
the
*NL*
indelicacy
!
--
the
horrible
ugliness
of
this
exposure
of
a
sick
*NL*
and
guilty
heart
to
the
very
eye
that
would
gloat
over
it
!
*NL*
Woman
,
woman
,
thou
art
accountable
for
this
!
--
I
can
not
forgive
*NL*
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
shalt
forgive
me
!
''
cried
Hester
,
flinging
herself
on
the
*NL*
fallen
leaves
beside
him
.
``
Let
God
punish
!
Thou
shalt
forgive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
sudden
and
desperate
tenderness
she
threw
her
arms
around
*NL*
him
,
and
pressed
his
head
against
her
bosom
,
little
caring
*NL*
though
his
cheek
rested
on
the
scarlet
letter
.
He
would
have
*NL*
released
himself
,
but
strove
in
vain
to
do
so
.
Hester
would
not
*NL*
set
him
free
,
lest
he
should
look
her
sternly
in
the
face
.
All
*NL*
the
world
had
frowned
on
her
--
for
seven
long
years
had
it
*NL*
frowned
upon
this
lonely
woman
--
and
still
she
bore
it
all
,
nor
*NL*
ever
once
turned
away
her
firm
,
sad
eyes
.
Heaven
,
likewise
,
had
*NL*
frowned
upon
her
,
and
she
had
not
died
.
But
the
frown
of
this
*NL*
pale
,
weak
,
sinful
,
and
sorrow-stricken
man
was
what
Hester
*NL*
could
not
bear
,
and
live
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wilt
thou
yet
forgive
me
?
''
she
repeated
,
over
and
over
again
.
*NL*
``
Wilt
thou
not
frown
?
Wilt
thou
forgive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
forgive
you
,
Hester
,
''
replied
the
minister
at
length
,
with
*NL*
a
deep
utterance
,
out
of
an
abyss
of
sadness
,
but
no
anger
.
``
I
*NL*
freely
forgive
you
now
.
May
God
forgive
us
both
.
We
are
not
,
*NL*
Hester
,
the
worst
sinners
in
the
world
.
There
is
one
worse
than
*NL*
even
the
polluted
priest
!
That
old
man
's
revenge
has
been
*NL*
blacker
than
my
sin
.
He
has
violated
,
in
cold
blood
,
the
*NL*
sanctity
of
a
human
heart
.
Thou
and
I
,
Hester
,
never
did
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
never
!
''
whispered
she
.
``
What
we
did
had
a
consecration
*NL*
of
its
own
.
We
felt
it
so
!
We
said
so
to
each
other
.
Hast
thou
*NL*
forgotten
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
Hester
!
''
said
Arthur
Dimmesdale
,
rising
from
the
ground
.
*NL*
``
No
;
I
have
not
forgotten
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
again
,
side
by
side
,
and
hand
clasped
in
hand
,
on
*NL*
the
mossy
trunk
of
the
fallen
tree
.
Life
had
never
brought
them
*NL*
a
gloomier
hour
;
it
was
the
point
whither
their
pathway
had
so
*NL*
long
been
tending
,
and
darkening
ever
,
as
it
stole
along
--
and
*NL*
yet
it
unclosed
a
charm
that
made
them
linger
upon
it
,
and
claim
*NL*
another
,
and
another
,
and
,
after
all
,
another
moment
.
The
forest
*NL*
was
obscure
around
them
,
and
creaked
with
a
blast
that
was
*NL*
passing
through
it
.
The
boughs
were
tossing
heavily
above
their
*NL*
heads
;
while
one
solemn
old
tree
groaned
dolefully
to
another
,
*NL*
as
if
telling
the
sad
story
of
the
pair
that
sat
beneath
,
or
*NL*
constrained
to
forbode
evil
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
they
lingered
.
How
dreary
looked
the
forest-track
that
*NL*
led
backward
to
the
settlement
,
where
Hester
Prynne
must
take
up
*NL*
again
the
burden
of
her
ignominy
and
the
minister
the
hollow
*NL*
mockery
of
his
good
name
!
So
they
lingered
an
instant
longer
.
No
*NL*
golden
light
had
ever
been
so
precious
as
the
gloom
of
this
dark
*NL*
forest
.
Here
seen
only
by
his
eyes
,
the
scarlet
letter
need
not
*NL*
burn
into
the
bosom
of
the
fallen
woman
!
Here
seen
only
by
her
*NL*
eyes
,
Arthur
Dimmesdale
,
false
to
God
and
man
,
might
be
,
for
one
*NL*
moment
true
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
at
a
thought
that
suddenly
occurred
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hester
!
''
cried
he
,
``
here
is
a
new
horror
!
Roger
Chillingworth
*NL*
knows
your
purpose
to
reveal
his
true
character
.
Will
he
*NL*
continue
,
then
,
to
keep
our
secret
?
What
will
now
be
the
course
*NL*
of
his
revenge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
strange
secrecy
in
his
nature
,
''
replied
Hester
,
*NL*
thoughtfully
;
``
and
it
has
grown
upon
him
by
the
hidden
practices
*NL*
of
his
revenge
.
I
deem
it
not
likely
that
he
will
betray
the
*NL*
secret
.
He
will
doubtless
seek
other
means
of
satiating
his
dark
*NL*
passion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
!
--
how
am
I
to
live
longer
,
breathing
the
same
air
with
*NL*
this
deadly
enemy
?
''
exclaimed
Arthur
Dimmesdale
,
shrinking
*NL*
within
himself
,
and
pressing
his
hand
nervously
against
his
*NL*
heart
--
a
gesture
that
had
grown
involuntary
with
him
.
``
Think
for
*NL*
me
,
Hester
!
Thou
art
strong
.
Resolve
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
must
dwell
no
longer
with
this
man
,
''
said
Hester
,
slowly
*NL*
and
firmly
.
``
Thy
heart
must
be
no
longer
under
his
evil
eye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
were
far
worse
than
death
!
''
replied
the
minister
.
``
But
how
*NL*
to
avoid
it
?
What
choice
remains
to
me
?
Shall
I
lie
down
again
*NL*
on
these
withered
leaves
,
where
I
cast
myself
when
thou
didst
*NL*
tell
me
what
he
was
?
Must
I
sink
down
there
,
and
die
at
once

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
what
a
ruin
has
befallen
thee
!
''
said
Hester
,
with
the
*NL*
tears
gushing
into
her
eyes
.
``
Wilt
thou
die
for
very
weakness
?
*NL*
There
is
no
other
cause
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
judgment
of
God
is
on
me
,
''
answered
the
conscience-stricken
*NL*
priest
.
``
It
is
too
mighty
for
me
to
struggle
with
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
would
show
mercy
,
''
rejoined
Hester
,
``
hadst
thou
but
the
*NL*
strength
to
take
advantage
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
thou
strong
for
me
!
''
answered
he
.
``
Advise
me
what
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
world
,
then
,
so
narrow
?
''
exclaimed
Hester
Prynne
,
fixing
*NL*
her
deep
eyes
on
the
minister
's
,
and
instinctively
exercising
a
*NL*
magnetic
power
over
a
spirit
so
shattered
and
subdued
that
it
*NL*
could
hardly
hold
itself
erect
.
``
Doth
the
universe
lie
within
*NL*
the
compass
of
yonder
town
,
which
only
a
little
time
ago
was
but
*NL*
a
leaf-strewn
desert
,
as
lonely
as
this
around
us
?
Whither
leads
*NL*
yonder
forest-track
?
Backward
to
the
settlement
,
thou
sayest
!
*NL*
Yes
;
but
,
onward
,
too
!
Deeper
it
goes
,
and
deeper
into
the
*NL*
wilderness
,
less
plainly
to
be
seen
at
every
step
;
until
some
*NL*
few
miles
hence
the
yellow
leaves
will
show
no
vestige
of
the
*NL*
white
man
's
tread
.
There
thou
art
free
!
So
brief
a
journey
would
*NL*
bring
thee
from
a
world
where
thou
hast
been
most
wretched
,
to
*NL*
one
where
thou
mayest
still
be
happy
!
Is
there
not
shade
enough
*NL*
in
all
this
boundless
forest
to
hide
thy
heart
from
the
gaze
of
*NL*
Roger
Chillingworth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Hester
;
but
only
under
the
fallen
leaves
!
''
replied
the
*NL*
minister
,
with
a
sad
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
is
the
broad
pathway
of
the
sea
!
''
continued
Hester
.
*NL*
``
It
brought
thee
hither
.
If
thou
so
choose
,
it
will
bear
thee
*NL*
back
again

In

native
land
,
whether
in
some
remote
rural

village
,
or
in
vast
London
--
or
,
surely
,
in
Germany
,
in
France
,
*NL*
in
pleasant
Italy
--
thou
wouldst
be
beyond
his
power

*NL*
knowledge

And
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
all
these
iron
men
,
and
*NL*
their
opinions
?
They
have
kept
thy
better
part
in
bondage

*NL*
long
already

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be

''
answered
the
minister
,
listening
as
if
he
were
*NL*
called
upon
to
realise
a
dream
.
``
I
am
powerless
to
go

Wretched

sinful
as
I
am

than
to
drag
on
*NL*
my
earthly
existence
in
the
sphere
where
Providence
hath
placed
*NL*
me

Lost
as
my
own
soul
is
,
I
would
still
do
what
I
may
for
*NL*
other
human
souls
!
I
dare
not
quit
my
post
,
though
an
unfaithful
*NL*
sentinel
,
whose
sure
reward
is
death
and
dishonour
,
when
his
*NL*
dreary
watch
shall
come
to
an
end
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
crushed
under
this
seven
years

weight
of
misery
,
''
*NL*
replied
Hester
,
fervently
resolved
to
buoy
him
up
with
her
own
*NL*
energy
.
``
But
thou
shalt
leave
it
all
behind
thee
!
It
shall
not
*NL*
cumber
thy
steps
,
as
thou
treadest
along
the
forest-path
:
*NL*
neither
shalt
thou
freight
the
ship
with
it
,
if
thou
prefer
to
*NL*
cross
the
sea
.
Leave
this
wreck
and
ruin
here
where
it
hath
*NL*
happened
.
Meddle
no
more
with
it
!
Begin
all
anew
!
Hast
thou
*NL*
exhausted
possibility
in
the
failure
of
this
one
trial
?
Not
so
!
*NL*
The
future
is
yet
full
of
trial
and
success
.
There
is
happiness
*NL*
to
be
enjoyed
!
There
is
good
to
be
done
!
Exchange
this
false
*NL*
life
of
thine
for
a
true
one

Be

if
thy

summon
thee

such
a

the
teacher

the
red
men

more
thy
nature

be
a
scholar

a
sage
among
the
wisest

*NL*
the
most
renowned
of
the
cultivated
world

Preach
!
Write
!
Act

*NL*
Do
anything
,
save
to
lie
down
and
die
!
Give
up
this
name
of
*NL*
Arthur
Dimmesdale
,
and
make
thyself
another
,
and
a
high
one
,
*NL*
such
as
thou
canst
wear
without
fear
or
shame

Why
shouldst
thou
*NL*
tarry
so
much
as
one
other
day
in
the
torments
that
have
so
*NL*
gnawed
into
thy
life

that

feeble
to

that

powerless

Up

away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Hester
!

cried
Arthur
Dimmesdale
,
in
whose
eyes
a
fitful
*NL*
light
,
kindled
by
her
enthusiasm
,
flashed
up
and
died
away
,
*NL*
``
thou
tellest
of
running
a
race
to
a
man

There
is
not
the

strength
or
courage
left
me
to
venture
into
the
wide
,
strange
,
*NL*
difficult
world
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
last
expression
of
the
despondency
of
a
broken
*NL*
spirit
.
He
lacked
energy
to
grasp
the
better
fortune
that
seemed
*NL*
within
his
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
the
word
--
``
Alone
,
Hester
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
shall
not
go
alone
!
''
answered
she
,
in
a
deep
whisper
.
*NL*
Then
,
all
was
spoken
!

XVIII
.
A
FLOOD
OF
SUNSHINE
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
Dimmesdale
gazed
into
Hester
's
face
with
a
look
in
which
*NL*
hope
and
joy
shone
out
,
indeed
,
but
with
fear
betwixt
them
,
and
*NL*
a
kind
of
horror
at
her
boldness
,
who
had
spoken
what
he
vaguely
*NL*
hinted
at
,
but
dared
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Hester
Prynne
,
with
a
mind
of
native
courage
and
activity
,
*NL*
and
for
so
long
a
period
not
merely
estranged
,
but
outlawed
from
*NL*
society
,
had
habituated
herself
to
such
latitude
of
speculation
*NL*
as
was
altogether
foreign
to
the
clergyman
.
She
had
wandered
,
*NL*
without
rule
or
guidance
,
in
a
moral
wilderness
,
as
vast
,
as
*NL*
intricate
,
and
shadowy
as
the
untamed
forest
,
amid
the
gloom
of
*NL*
which
they
were
now
holding
a
colloquy
that
was
to
decide
their
*NL*
fate
.
Her
intellect
and
heart
had
their
home
,
as
it
were
,
in
*NL*
desert
places
,
where
she
roamed
as
freely
as
the
wild
Indian
in
*NL*
his
woods
.
For
years
past
she
had
looked
from
this
estranged
*NL*
point
of
view
at
human
institutions
,
and
whatever
priests
or
*NL*
legislators
had
established
;
criticising
all
with
hardly
more
*NL*
reverence
than
the
Indian
would
feel
for
the
clerical
band
,
the
*NL*
judicial
robe
,
the
pillory
,
the
gallows
,
the
fireside
,
or
the
*NL*
church
.
The
tendency
of
her
fate
and
fortunes
had
been
to
set
*NL*
her
free
.
The
scarlet
letter
was
her
passport
into
regions
where
*NL*
other
women
dared
not
tread
.
Shame
,
Despair
,
Solitude
!
These
had
*NL*
been
her
teachers
--
stern
and
wild
ones
--
and
they
had
made
her
*NL*
strong
,
but
taught
her
much
amiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
,
on
the
other
hand
,
had
never
gone
through
an
*NL*
experience
calculated
to
lead
him
beyond
the
scope
of
generally
*NL*
received
laws
;
although
,
in
a
single
instance
,
he
had
so
*NL*
fearfully
transgressed
one
of
the
most
sacred
of
them
.
But
this
*NL*
had
been
a
sin
of
passion
,
not
of
principle
,
nor
even
purpose
.
*NL*
Since
that
wretched
epoch
,
he
had
watched
with
morbid
zeal
and
*NL*
minuteness
,
not
his
acts
--
for
those
it
was
easy
to
arrange
--
but
*NL*
each
breath
of
emotion
,
and
his
every
thought
.
At
the
head
of
*NL*
the
social
system
,
as
the
clergymen
of
that
day
stood
,
he
was
*NL*
only
the
more
trammelled
by
its
regulations
,
its
principles
,
and
*NL*
even
its
prejudices
.
As
a
priest
,
the
framework
of
his
order
*NL*
inevitably
hemmed
him
in
.
As
a
man
who
had
once
sinned
,
but
who
*NL*
kept
his
conscience
all
alive
and
painfully
sensitive
by
the
*NL*
fretting
of
an
unhealed
wound
,
he
might
have
been
supposed
safer
*NL*
within
the
line
of
virtue
than
if
he
had
never
sinned
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
we
seem
to
see
that
,
as
regarded
Hester
Prynne
,
the
whole
*NL*
seven
years
of
outlaw
and
ignominy
had
been
little
other
than
a
*NL*
preparation
for
this
very
hour
.
But
Arthur
Dimmesdale
!
Were
such
*NL*
a
man
once
more
to
fall
,
what
plea
could
be
urged
in
extenuation
*NL*
of
his
crime
?
None
;
unless
it
avail
him
somewhat
that
he
was
*NL*
broken
down
by
long
and
exquisite
suffering
;
that
his
mind
was
*NL*
darkened
and
confused
by
the
very
remorse
which
harrowed
it
;
*NL*
that
,
between
fleeing
as
an
avowed
criminal
,
and
remaining
as
a
*NL*
hypocrite
,
conscience
might
find
it
hard
to
strike
the
balance
;
*NL*
that
it
was
human
to
avoid
the
peril
of
death
and
infamy
,
and
*NL*
the
inscrutable
machinations
of
an
enemy
;
that
,
finally
,
to
this
*NL*
poor
pilgrim
,
on
his
dreary
and
desert
path
,
faint
,
sick
,
*NL*
miserable
,
there
appeared
a
glimpse
of
human
affection
and
*NL*
sympathy
,
a
new
life
,
and
a
true
one
,
in
exchange
for
the
heavy
*NL*
doom
which
he
was
now
expiating
.
And
be
the
stern
and
sad
truth
*NL*
spoken
,
that
the
breach
which
guilt
has
once
made
into
the
human
*NL*
soul
is
never
,
in
this
mortal
state
,
repaired
.
It
may
be
watched
*NL*
and
guarded
,
so
that
the
enemy
shall
not
force
his
way
again
*NL*
into
the
citadel
,
and
might
even
in
his
subsequent
assaults
,
*NL*
select
some
other
avenue
,
in
preference
to
that
where
he
had
*NL*
formerly
succeeded
.
But
there
is
still
the
ruined
wall
,
and
near
*NL*
it
the
stealthy
tread
of
the
foe
that
would
win
over
again
his
*NL*
unforgotten
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
struggle
,
if
there
were
one
,
need
not
be
described
.
Let
it
*NL*
suffice
that
the
clergyman
resolved
to
flee
,
and
not
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
in
all
these
past
seven
years
,
''
thought
he
,
``
I
could
recall
*NL*
one
instant
of
peace
or
hope
,
I
would
yet
endure
,
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
that
earnest
of
Heaven
's
mercy
.
But
now
--
since
I
am
*NL*
irrevocably
doomed
--
wherefore
should
I
not
snatch
the
solace
*NL*
allowed
to
the
condemned
culprit
before
his
execution
?
Or
,
if
*NL*
this
be
the
path
to
a
better
life
,
as
Hester
would
persuade
me
,
*NL*
I
surely
give
up
no
fairer
prospect
by
pursuing
it
!
Neither
can
*NL*
I
any
longer
live
without
her
companionship
;
so
powerful
is
she
*NL*
to
sustain
--
so
tender
to
soothe
!
O
Thou
to
whom
I
dare
not
lift
*NL*
mine
eyes
,
wilt
Thou
yet
pardon
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
wilt
go
!
''
said
Hester
calmly
,
as
he
met
her
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
decision
once
made
,
a
glow
of
strange
enjoyment
threw
its
*NL*
flickering
brightness
over
the
trouble
of
his
breast
.
It
was
the
*NL*
exhilarating
effect
--
upon
a
prisoner
just
escaped
from
the
*NL*
dungeon
of
his
own
heart
--
of
breathing
the
wild
,
free
atmosphere
*NL*
of
an
unredeemed
,
unchristianised
,
lawless
region
.
His
spirit
*NL*
rose
,
as
it
were
,
with
a
bound
,
and
attained
a
nearer
prospect
*NL*
of
the
sky
,
than
throughout
all
the
misery
which
had
kept
him
*NL*
grovelling
on
the
earth
.
Of
a
deeply
religious
temperament
,
*NL*
there
was
inevitably
a
tinge
of
the
devotional
in
his
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
feel
joy
again
?
''
cried
he
,
wondering
at
himself
.
*NL*
``
Methought
the
germ
of
it
was
dead
in
me
!
Oh
,
Hester
,
thou
art
*NL*
my
better
angel
!
I
seem
to
have
flung
myself
--
sick
,
sin-stained
,
*NL*
and
sorrow-blackened
--
down
upon
these
forest
leaves
,
and
to
have
*NL*
risen
up
all
made
anew
,
and
with
new
powers
to
glorify
Him
that
*NL*
hath
been
merciful
!
This
is
already
the
better
life
!
Why
did
we
*NL*
not
find
it
sooner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
not
look
back
,
''
answered
Hester
Prynne
.
``
The
past
is
*NL*
gone
!
Wherefore
should
we
linger
upon
it
now
?
See
!
With
this
*NL*
symbol
I
undo
it
all
,
and
make
it
as
if
it
had
never
been
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
speaking
,
she
undid
the
clasp
that
fastened
the
scarlet
*NL*
letter
,
and
,
taking
it
from
her
bosom
,
threw
it
to
a
distance
*NL*
among
the
withered
leaves
.
The
mystic
token
alighted
on
the
*NL*
hither
verge
of
the
stream
.
With
a
hand
's
-
breadth
further
*NL*
flight
,
it
would
have
fallen
into
the
water
,
and
have
given
the
*NL*
little
brook
another
woe
to
carry
onward
,
besides
the
*NL*
unintelligible
tale
which
it
still
kept
murmuring
about
.
But
*NL*
there
lay
the
embroidered
letter
,
glittering
like
a
lost
jewel
,
*NL*
which
some
ill-fated
wanderer
might
pick
up
,
and
thenceforth
be
*NL*
haunted
by
strange
phantoms
of
guilt
,
sinkings
of
the
heart
,
and
*NL*
unaccountable
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stigma
gone
,
Hester
heaved
a
long
,
deep
sigh
,
in
which
the
*NL*
burden
of
shame
and
anguish
departed
from
her
spirit
.
O
*NL*
exquisite
relief
!
She
had
not
known
the
weight
until
she
felt
*NL*
the
freedom
!
By
another
impulse
,
she
took
off
the
formal
cap
*NL*
that
confined
her
hair
,
and
down
it
fell
upon
her
shoulders
,
*NL*
dark
and
rich
,
with
at
once
a
shadow
and
a
light
in
its
*NL*
abundance
,
and
imparting
the
charm
of
softness
to
her
features
.
*NL*
There
played
around
her
mouth
,
and
beamed
out
of
her
eyes
,
a
*NL*
radiant
and
tender
smile
,
that
seemed
gushing
from
the
very
*NL*
heart
of
womanhood
.
A
crimson
flush
was
glowing
on
her
cheek
,
*NL*
that
had
been
long
so
pale
.
Her
sex
,
her
youth
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
richness
of
her
beauty
,
came
back
from
what
men
call
the
*NL*
irrevocable
past
,
and
clustered
themselves
with
her
maiden
hope
,
*NL*
and
a
happiness
before
unknown
,
within
the
magic
circle
of
this
*NL*
hour
.
And
,
as
if
the
gloom
of
the
earth
and
sky
had
been
but
the
*NL*
effluence
of
these
two
mortal
hearts
,
it
vanished
with
their
*NL*
sorrow
.
All
at
once
,
as
with
a
sudden
smile
of
heaven
,
forth
*NL*
burst
the
sunshine
,
pouring
a
very
flood
into
the
obscure
*NL*
forest
,
gladdening
each
green
leaf
,
transmuting
the
yellow
*NL*
fallen
ones
to
gold
,
and
gleaming
adown
the
gray
trunks
of
the
*NL*
solemn
trees
.
The
objects
that
had
made
a
shadow
hitherto
,
*NL*
embodied
the
brightness
now
.
The
course
of
the
little
brook
*NL*
might
be
traced
by
its
merry
gleam
afar
into
the
wood
's
heart
of
*NL*
mystery
,
which
had
become
a
mystery
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
sympathy
of
Nature
--
that
wild
,
heathen
Nature
of
*NL*
the
forest
,
never
subjugated
by
human
law
,
nor
illumined
by
*NL*
higher
truth
--
with
the
bliss
of
these
two
spirits
!
Love
,
whether
*NL*
newly-born
,
or
aroused
from
a
death-like
slumber
,
must
always
*NL*
create
a
sunshine
,
filling
the
heart
so
full
of
radiance
,
that
*NL*
it
overflows
upon
the
outward
world
.
Had
the
forest
still
kept
*NL*
its
gloom
,
it
would
have
been
bright
in
Hester
's
eyes
,
and
*NL*
bright
in
Arthur
Dimmesdale
's
!
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
looked
at
him
with
a
thrill
of
another
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
must
know
Pearl
!
''
said
she
.
``
Our
little
Pearl
!
Thou
hast
*NL*
seen
her
--
yes
,
I
know
it
!
--
but
thou
wilt
see
her
now
with
other
*NL*
eyes
.
She
is
a
strange
child
!
I
hardly
comprehend
her
!
But
thou
*NL*
wilt
love
her
dearly
,
as
I
do
,
and
wilt
advise
me
how
to
deal
*NL*
with
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
think
the
child
will
be
glad
to
know
me
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
minister
,
somewhat
uneasily
.
``
I
have
long
shrunk
from
children
,
*NL*
because
they
often
show
a
distrust
--
a
backwardness
to
be
*NL*
familiar
with
me
.
I
have
even
been
afraid
of
little
Pearl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
was
sad
!
''
answered
the
mother
.
``
But
she
will
love
*NL*
thee
dearly
,
and
thou
her
.
She
is
not
far
off
.
I
will
call
her
.
*NL*
Pearl
!
Pearl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
the
child
,
''
observed
the
minister
.
``
Yonder
she
is
,
*NL*
standing
in
a
streak
of
sunshine
,
a
good
way
off
,
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
brook
.
So
thou
thinkest
the
child
will
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
smiled
,
and
again
called
to
Pearl
,
who
was
visible
at
*NL*
some
distance
,
as
the
minister
had
described
her
,
like
a
*NL*
bright-apparelled
vision
in
a
sunbeam
,
which
fell
down
upon
her
*NL*
through
an
arch
of
boughs
.
The
ray
quivered
to
and
fro
,
making
*NL*
her
figure
dim
or
distinct
--
now
like
a
real
child
,
now
like
a
*NL*
child
's
spirit
--
as
the
splendour
went
and
came
again
.
She
heard
*NL*
her
mother
's
voice
,
and
approached
slowly
through
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
had
not
found
the
hour
pass
wearisomely
while
her
mother
*NL*
sat
talking
with
the
clergyman
.
The
great
black
forest
--
stern
as
*NL*
it
showed
itself
to
those
who
brought
the
guilt
and
troubles
of
*NL*
the
world
into
its
bosom
--
became
the
playmate
of
the
lonely
*NL*
infant
,
as
well
as
it
knew
how
.
Sombre
as
it
was
,
it
put
on
the
*NL*
kindest
of
its
moods
to
welcome
her
.
It
offered
her
the
*NL*
partridge-berries
,
the
growth
of
the
preceding
autumn
,
but
*NL*
ripening
only
in
the
spring
,
and
now
red
as
drops
of
blood
upon
*NL*
the
withered
leaves
.
These
Pearl
gathered
,
and
was
pleased
with
*NL*
their
wild
flavour
.
The
small
denizens
of
the
wilderness
hardly
*NL*
took
pains
to
move
out
of
her
path
.
A
partridge
,
indeed
,
with
a
*NL*
brood
of
ten
behind
her
,
ran
forward
threateningly
,
but
soon
*NL*
repented
of
her
fierceness
,
and
clucked
to
her
young
ones
not
to
*NL*
be
afraid
.
A
pigeon
,
alone
on
a
low
branch
,
allowed
Pearl
to
*NL*
come
beneath
,
and
uttered
a
sound
as
much
of
greeting
as
alarm
.
*NL*
A
squirrel
,
from
the
lofty
depths
of
his
domestic
tree
,
*NL*
chattered
either
in
anger
or
merriment
--
for
the
squirrel
is
such
*NL*
a
choleric
and
humorous
little
personage
,
that
it
is
hard
to
*NL*
distinguish
between
his
moods
--
so
he
chattered
at
the
child
,
and
*NL*
flung
down
a
nut
upon
her
head
.
It
was
a
last
year
's
nut
,
and
*NL*
already
gnawed
by
his
sharp
tooth
.
A
fox
,
startled
from
his
*NL*
sleep
by
her
light
footstep
on
the
leaves
,
looked
inquisitively
*NL*
at
Pearl
,
as
doubting
whether
it
were
better
to
steal
off
,
or
*NL*
renew
his
nap
on
the
same
spot
.
A
wolf
,
it
is
said
--
but
here
the
*NL*
tale
has
surely
lapsed
into
the
improbable
--
came
up
and
smelt
of
*NL*
Pearl
's
robe
,
and
offered
his
savage
head
to
be
patted
by
her
*NL*
hand
.
The
truth
seems
to
be
,
however
,
that
the
mother-forest
,
*NL*
and
these
wild
things
which
it
nourished
,
all
recognised
a
*NL*
kindred
wilderness
in
the
human
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
was
gentler
here
than
in
the
grassy-margined
streets
of
*NL*
the
settlement
,
or
in
her
mother
's
cottage
.
The
Bowers
appeared
*NL*
to
know
it
,
and
one
and
another
whispered
as
she
passed
,
``
Adorn
*NL*
thyself
with
me
,
thou
beautiful
child
,
adorn
thyself
with
*NL*
me
!
''
--
and
,
to
please
them
,
Pearl
gathered
the
violets
,
and
*NL*
anemones
,
and
columbines
,
and
some
twigs
of
the
freshest
green
,
*NL*
which
the
old
trees
held
down
before
her
eyes
.
With
these
she
*NL*
decorated
her
hair
and
her
young
waist
,
and
became
a
nymph
*NL*
child
,
or
an
infant
dryad
,
or
whatever
else
was
in
closest
*NL*
sympathy
with
the
antique
wood
.
In
such
guise
had
Pearl
adorned
*NL*
herself
,
when
she
heard
her
mother
's
voice
,
and
came
slowly
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
--
for
she
saw
the
clergyman
!

THE
CHILD
AT
THE
BROOKSIDE
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
wilt
love
her
dearly
,
''
repeated
Hester
Prynne
,
as
she
and
*NL*
the
minister
sat
watching
little
Pearl
.
``
Dost
thou
not
think
her
*NL*
beautiful
?
And
see
with
what
natural
skill
she
has
made
those
*NL*
simple
flowers
adorn
her
!
Had
she
gathered
pearls
,
and
diamonds
,
*NL*
and
rubies
in
the
wood
,
they
could
not
have
become
her
better
!
*NL*
She
is
a
splendid
child
!
But
I
know
whose
brow
she
has
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
know
,
Hester
,
''
said
Arthur
Dimmesdale
,
with
an
*NL*
unquiet
smile
,
``
that
this
dear
child
,
tripping
about
always
at
*NL*
thy
side
,
hath
caused
me
many
an
alarm
?
Methought
--
oh
,
Hester
,
*NL*
what
a
thought
is
that
,
and
how
terrible
to
dread
it
!
--
that
my
*NL*
own
features
were
partly
repeated
in
her
face
,
and
so
strikingly
*NL*
that
the
world
might
see
them
!
But
she
is
mostly
thine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
Not
mostly
!
''
answered
the
mother
,
with
a
tender
smile
.
*NL*
``
A
little
longer
,
and
thou
needest
not
to
be
afraid
to
trace
*NL*
whose
child
she
is
.
But
how
strangely
beautiful
she
looks
with
*NL*
those
wild
flowers
in
her
hair
!
It
is
as
if
one
of
the
fairies
,
*NL*
whom
we
left
in
dear
old
England
,
had
decked
her
out
to
meet
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
a
feeling
which
neither
of
them
had
ever
before
*NL*
experienced
,
that
they
sat
and
watched
Pearl
's
slow
advance
.
In
*NL*
her
was
visible
the
tie
that
united
them
.
She
had
been
offered
*NL*
to
the
world
,
these
seven
past
years
,
as
the
living
*NL*
hieroglyphic
,
in
which
was
revealed
the
secret
they
so
darkly
*NL*
sought
to
hide
--
all
written
in
this
symbol
--
all
plainly
*NL*
manifest
--
had
there
been
a
prophet
or
magician
skilled
to
read
*NL*
the
character
of
flame
!
And
Pearl
was
the
oneness
of
their
*NL*
being
.
Be
the
foregone
evil
what
it
might
,
how
could
they
doubt
*NL*
that
their
earthly
lives
and
future
destinies
were
conjoined
*NL*
when
they
beheld
at
once
the
material
union
,
and
the
spiritual
*NL*
idea
,
in
whom
they
met
,
and
were
to
dwell
immortally
together
;
*NL*
thoughts
like
these
--
and
perhaps
other
thoughts
,
which
they
did
*NL*
not
acknowledge
or
define
--
threw
an
awe
about
the
child
as
she
*NL*
came
onward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
see
nothing
strange
--
no
passion
or
eagerness
--
in
thy
*NL*
way
of
accosting
her
,
''
whispered
Hester
.
``
Our
Pearl
is
a
fitful
*NL*
and
fantastic
little
elf
sometimes
.
Especially
she
is
generally
*NL*
intolerant
of
emotion
,
when
she
does
not
fully
comprehend
the
*NL*
why
and
wherefore
.
But
the
child
hath
strong
affections
!
She
*NL*
loves
me
,
and
will
love
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
canst
not
think
,
''
said
the
minister
,
glancing
aside
at
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
,
``
how
my
heart
dreads
this
interview
,
and
yearns
*NL*
for
it
!
But
,
in
truth
,
as
I
already
told
thee
,
children
are
not
*NL*
readily
won
to
be
familiar
with
me
.
They
will
not
climb
my
knee
,
*NL*
nor
prattle
in
my
ear
,
nor
answer
to
my
smile
,
but
stand
apart
,
*NL*
and
eye
me
strangely
.
Even
little
babes
,
when
I
take
them
in
my
*NL*
arms
,
weep
bitterly
.
Yet
Pearl
,
twice
in
her
little
lifetime
,
*NL*
hath
been
kind
to
me
!
The
first
time
--
thou
knowest
it
well
!
The
*NL*
last
was
when
thou
ledst
her
with
thee
to
the
house
of
yonder
*NL*
stern
old
Governor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
thou
didst
plead
so
bravely
in
her
behalf
and
mine
!
''
*NL*
answered
the
mother
.
``
I
remember
it
;
and
so
shall
little
Pearl
.
*NL*
Fear
nothing
.
She
may
be
strange
and
shy
at
first
,
but
will
soon
*NL*
learn
to
love
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Pearl
had
reached
the
margin
of
the
brook
,
and
*NL*
stood
on
the
further
side
,
gazing
silently
at
Hester
and
the
*NL*
clergyman
,
who
still
sat
together
on
the
mossy
tree-trunk
*NL*
waiting
to
receive
her
.
Just
where
she
had
paused
,
the
brook
*NL*
chanced
to
form
a
pool
so
smooth
and
quiet
that
it
reflected
a
*NL*
perfect
image
of
her
little
figure
,
with
all
the
brilliant
*NL*
picturesqueness
of
her
beauty
,
in
its
adornment
of
flowers
and
*NL*
wreathed
foliage
,
but
more
refined
and
spiritualized
than
the
*NL*
reality
.
This
image
,
so
nearly
identical
with
the
living
Pearl
,
*NL*
seemed
to
communicate
somewhat
of
its
own
shadowy
and
intangible
*NL*
quality
to
the
child
herself
.
It
was
strange
,
the
way
in
which
*NL*
Pearl
stood
,
looking
so
steadfastly
at
them
through
the
dim
*NL*
medium
of
the
forest
gloom
,
herself
,
meanwhile
,
all
glorified
*NL*
with
a
ray
of
sunshine
,
that
was
attracted
thitherward
as
by
a
*NL*
certain
sympathy
.
In
the
brook
beneath
stood
another
*NL*
child
--
another
and
the
same
--
with
likewise
its
ray
of
golden
*NL*
light
.
Hester
felt
herself
,
in
some
indistinct
and
tantalizing
*NL*
manner
,
estranged
from
Pearl
,
as
if
the
child
,
in
her
lonely
*NL*
ramble
through
the
forest
,
had
strayed
out
of
the
sphere
in
*NL*
which
she
and
her
mother
dwelt
together
,
and
was
now
vainly
*NL*
seeking
to
return
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
both
truth
and
error
in
the
impression
;
the
child
and
*NL*
mother
were
estranged
,
but
through
Hester
's
fault
,
not
Pearl
's
.
*NL*
Since
the
latter
rambled
from
her
side
,
another
inmate
had
been
*NL*
admitted
within
the
circle
of
the
mother
's
feelings
,
and
so
*NL*
modified
the
aspect
of
them
all
,
that
Pearl
,
the
returning
*NL*
wanderer
,
could
not
find
her
wonted
place
,
and
hardly
knew
where
*NL*
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
strange
fancy
,
''
observed
the
sensitive
minister
,
``
that
*NL*
this
brook
is
the
boundary
between
two
worlds
,
and
that
thou
*NL*
canst
never
meet
thy
Pearl
again
.
Or
is
she
an
elfish
spirit
,
*NL*
who
,
as
the
legends
of
our
childhood
taught
us
,
is
forbidden
to
*NL*
cross
a
running
stream
?
Pray
hasten
her
,
for
this
delay
has
*NL*
already
imparted
a
tremor
to
my
nerves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
dearest
child
!
''
said
Hester
encouragingly
,
and
stretching
*NL*
out
both
her
arms
.
``
How
slow
thou
art
!
When
hast
thou
been
so
*NL*
sluggish
before
now
?
Here
is
a
friend
of
mine
,
who
must
be
thy
*NL*
friend
also
.
Thou
wilt
have
twice
as
much
love
henceforward
as
*NL*
thy
mother
alone
could
give
thee
!
Leap
across
the
brook
and
come
*NL*
to
us
.
Thou
canst
leap
like
a
young
deer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
,
without
responding
in
any
manner
to
these
honey-sweet
*NL*
expressions
,
remained
on
the
other
side
of
the
brook
.
Now
she
*NL*
fixed
her
bright
wild
eyes
on
her
mother
,
now
on
the
minister
,
*NL*
and
now
included
them
both
in
the
same
glance
,
as
if
to
detect
*NL*
and
explain
to
herself
the
relation
which
they
bore
to
one
*NL*
another
.
For
some
unaccountable
reason
,
as
Arthur
Dimmesdale
*NL*
felt
the
child
's
eyes
upon
himself
,
his
hand
--
with
that
gesture
*NL*
so
habitual
as
to
have
become
involuntary
--
stole
over
his
heart
.
*NL*
At
length
,
assuming
a
singular
air
of
authority
,
Pearl
stretched
*NL*
out
her
hand
,
with
the
small
forefinger
extended
,
and
pointing
*NL*
evidently
towards
her
mother
's
breast
.
And
beneath
,
in
the
*NL*
mirror
of
the
brook
,
there
was
the
flower-girdled
and
sunny
*NL*
image
of
little
Pearl
,
pointing
her
small
forefinger
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
strange
child
!
why
dost
thou
not
come
to
me
?
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Hester
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
still
pointed
with
her
forefinger
,
and
a
frown
gathered
on
*NL*
her
brow
--
the
more
impressive
from
the
childish
,
the
almost
*NL*
baby-like
aspect
of
the
features
that
conveyed
it
.
As
her
mother
*NL*
still
kept
beckoning
to
her
,
and
arraying
her
face
in
a
holiday
*NL*
suit
of
unaccustomed
smiles
,
the
child
stamped
her
foot
with
a
*NL*
yet
more
imperious
look
and
gesture
.
In
the
brook
,
again
,
was
*NL*
the
fantastic
beauty
of
the
image
,
with
its
reflected
frown
,
its
*NL*
pointed
finger
,
and
imperious
gesture
,
giving
emphasis
to
the
*NL*
aspect
of
little
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hasten
,
Pearl
,
or
I
shall
be
angry
with
thee
!
''
cried
Hester
*NL*
Prynne
,
who
,
however
,
inured
to
such
behaviour
on
the
*NL*
elf-child
's
part
at
other
seasons
,
was
naturally
anxious
for
a
*NL*
more
seemly
deportment
now
.
``
Leap
across
the
brook
,
naughty
*NL*
child
,
and
run
hither
!
Else
I
must
come
to
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Pearl
,
not
a
whit
startled
at
her
mother
's
threats
any
more
*NL*
than
mollified
by
her
entreaties
,
now
suddenly
burst
into
a
fit
*NL*
of
passion
,
gesticulating
violently
,
and
throwing
her
small
*NL*
figure
into
the
most
extravagant
contortions
.
She
accompanied
*NL*
this
wild
outbreak
with
piercing
shrieks
,
which
the
woods
*NL*
reverberated
on
all
sides
,
so
that
,
alone
as
she
was
in
her
*NL*
childish
and
unreasonable
wrath
,
it
seemed
as
if
a
hidden
*NL*
multitude
were
lending
her
their
sympathy
and
encouragement
.
*NL*
Seen
in
the
brook
once
more
was
the
shadowy
wrath
of
Pearl
's
*NL*
image
,
crowned
and
girdled
with
flowers
,
but
stamping
its
foot
,
*NL*
wildly
gesticulating
,
and
,
in
the
midst
of
all
,
still
pointing
*NL*
its
small
forefinger
at
Hester
's
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
what
ails
the
child
,
''
whispered
Hester
to
the
clergyman
,
*NL*
and
turning
pale
in
spite
of
a
strong
effort
to
conceal
her
*NL*
trouble
and
annoyance
,
``
Children
will
not
abide
any
,
the
*NL*
slightest
,
change
in
the
accustomed
aspect
of
things
that
are
*NL*
daily
before
their
eyes
.
Pearl
misses
something
that
she
has
*NL*
always
seen
me
wear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pray
you
,
''
answered
the
minister
,
``
if
thou
hast
any
means
of
*NL*
pacifying
the
child
,
do
it
forthwith
!
Save
it
were
the
cankered
*NL*
wrath
of
an
old
witch
like
Mistress
Hibbins
,
''
added
he
,
*NL*
attempting
to
smile
,
``
I
know
nothing
that
I
would
not
sooner
*NL*
encounter
than
this
passion
in
a
child
.
In
Pearl
's
young
beauty
,
*NL*
as
in
the
wrinkled
witch
,
it
has
a
preternatural
effect
.
Pacify
*NL*
her
if
thou
lovest
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
turned
again
towards
Pearl
with
a
crimson
blush
upon
her
*NL*
cheek
,
a
conscious
glance
aside
clergyman
,
and
then
a
heavy
*NL*
sigh
,
while
,
even
before
she
had
time
to
speak
,
the
blush
*NL*
yielded
to
a
deadly
pallor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pearl
,
''
said
she
sadly
,
``
look
down
at
thy
feet
!
There
!
--
before
*NL*
thee
!
--
on
the
hither
side
of
the
brook
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
turned
her
eyes
to
the
point
indicated
,
and
there
lay
*NL*
the
scarlet
letter
so
close
upon
the
margin
of
the
stream
that
*NL*
the
gold
embroidery
was
reflected
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
it
hither
!
''
said
Hester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
thou
and
take
it
up
!
''
answered
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
ever
such
a
child
!
''
observed
Hester
aside
to
the
minister
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
have
much
to
tell
thee
about
her
!
But
,
in
very
truth
,
she
*NL*
is
right
as
regards
this
hateful
token
.
I
must
bear
its
torture
*NL*
yet
a
little
longer
--
only
a
few
days
longer
--
until
we
shall
have
*NL*
left
this
region
,
and
look
back
hither
as
to
a
land
which
we
*NL*
have
dreamed
of
.
The
forest
can
not
hide
it
!
The
mid-ocean
shall
*NL*
take
it
from
my
hand
,
and
swallow
it
up
for
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
she
advanced
to
the
margin
of
the
brook
,
took
*NL*
up
the
scarlet
letter
,
and
fastened
it
again
into
her
bosom
.
*NL*
Hopefully
,
but
a
moment
ago
,
as
Hester
had
spoken
of
drowning
it
*NL*
in
the
deep
sea
,
there
was
a
sense
of
inevitable
doom
upon
her
*NL*
as
she
thus
received
back
this
deadly
symbol
from
the
hand
of
*NL*
fate
.
She
had
flung
it
into
infinite
space
!
she
had
drawn
an
*NL*
hour
's
free
breath
!
and
here
again
was
the
scarlet
misery
*NL*
glittering
on
the
old
spot
!
So
it
ever
is
,
whether
thus
typified
*NL*
or
no
,
that
an
evil
deed
invests
itself
with
the
character
of
*NL*
doom
.
Hester
next
gathered
up
the
heavy
tresses
of
her
hair
and
*NL*
confined
them
beneath
her
cap
.
As
if
there
were
a
withering
*NL*
spell
in
the
sad
letter
,
her
beauty
,
the
warmth
and
richness
of
*NL*
her
womanhood
,
departed
like
fading
sunshine
,
and
a
gray
shadow
*NL*
seemed
to
fall
across
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
dreary
change
was
wrought
,
she
extended
her
hand
to
*NL*
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
know
thy
mother
now
,
child
?
''
,
asked
she
,
*NL*
reproachfully
,
but
with
a
subdued
tone
.
``
Wilt
thou
come
across
*NL*
the
brook
,
and
own
thy
mother
,
now
that
she
has
her
shame
upon
*NL*
her
--
now
that
she
is
sad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
now
I
will
!
''
answered
the
child
,
bounding
across
the
*NL*
brook
,
and
clasping
Hester
in
her
arms
``
Now
thou
art
my
mother
*NL*
indeed
!
and
I
am
thy
little
Pearl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
mood
of
tenderness
that
was
not
usual
with
her
,
she
drew
*NL*
down
her
mother
's
head
,
and
kissed
her
brow
and
both
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
But
then
--
by
a
kind
of
necessity
that
always
impelled
this
child
*NL*
to
alloy
whatever
comfort
she
might
chance
to
give
with
a
throb
*NL*
of
anguish
--
Pearl
put
up
her
mouth
and
kissed
the
scarlet
*NL*
letter
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
not
kind
!
''
said
Hester
.
``
When
thou
hast
shown
me
a
*NL*
little
love
,
thou
mockest
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
doth
the
minister
sit
yonder
?
''
asked
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
waits
to
welcome
thee
,
''
replied
her
mother
.
``
Come
thou
,
and
*NL*
entreat
his
blessing
!
He
loves
thee
,
my
little
Pearl
,
and
loves
*NL*
thy
mother
,
too
.
Wilt
thou
not
love
him
?
Come
he
longs
to
greet
*NL*
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doth
he
love
us
?
''
said
Pearl
,
looking
up
with
acute
*NL*
intelligence
into
her
mother
's
face
.
``
Will
he
go
back
with
us
,
*NL*
hand
in
hand
,
we
three
together
,
into
the
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
now
,
my
child
,
''
answered
Hester
.
``
But
in
days
to
come
he
*NL*
will
walk
hand
in
hand
with
us
.
We
will
have
a
home
and
fireside
*NL*
of
our
own
;
and
thou
shalt
sit
upon
his
knee
;
and
he
will
teach
*NL*
thee
many
things
,
and
love
thee
dearly
.
Thou
wilt
love
him
--
wilt
*NL*
thou
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
he
always
keep
his
hand
over
his
heart
?
''
inquired
*NL*
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Foolish
child
,
what
a
question
is
that
!
''
exclaimed
her
mother
.
*NL*
``
Come
,
and
ask
his
blessing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
whether
influenced
by
the
jealousy
that
seems
instinctive
*NL*
with
every
petted
child
towards
a
dangerous
rival
,
or
from
*NL*
whatever
caprice
of
her
freakish
nature
,
Pearl
would
show
no
*NL*
favour
to
the
clergyman
.
It
was
only
by
an
exertion
of
force
*NL*
that
her
mother
brought
her
up
to
him
,
hanging
back
,
and
*NL*
manifesting
her
reluctance
by
odd
grimaces
;
of
which
,
ever
since
*NL*
her
babyhood
,
she
had
possessed
a
singular
variety
,
and
could
*NL*
transform
her
mobile
physiognomy
into
a
series
of
different
*NL*
aspects
,
with
a
new
mischief
in
them
,
each
and
all
.
The
*NL*
minister
--
painfully
embarrassed
,
but
hoping
that
a
kiss
might
*NL*
prove
a
talisman
to
admit
him
into
the
child
's
kindlier
*NL*
regards
--
bent
forward
,
and
impressed
one
on
her
brow
.
Hereupon
,
*NL*
Pearl
broke
away
from
her
mother
,
and
,
running
to
the
brook
,
*NL*
stooped
over
it
,
and
bathed
her
forehead
,
until
the
unwelcome
*NL*
kiss
was
quite
washed
off
and
diffused
through
a
long
lapse
of
*NL*
the
gliding
water
.
She
then
remained
apart
,
silently
watching
*NL*
Hester
and
the
clergyman
;
while
they
talked
together
and
made
*NL*
such
arrangements
as
were
suggested
by
their
new
position
and
*NL*
the
purposes
soon
to
be
fulfilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
this
fateful
interview
had
come
to
a
close
.
The
dell
*NL*
was
to
be
left
in
solitude
among
its
dark
,
old
trees
,
which
,
*NL*
with
their
multitudinous
tongues
,
would
whisper
long
of
what
had
*NL*
passed
there
,
and
no
mortal
be
the
wiser
.
And
the
melancholy
*NL*
brook
would
add
this
other
tale
to
the
mystery
with
which
its
*NL*
little
heart
was
already
overburdened
,
and
whereof
it
still
kept
*NL*
up
a
murmuring
babble
,
with
not
a
whit
more
cheerfulness
of
tone
*NL*
than
for
ages
heretofore
.

THE
MINISTER
IN
A
MAZE
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
minister
departed
,
in
advance
of
Hester
Prynne
and
little
*NL*
Pearl
,
he
threw
a
backward
glance
,
half
expecting
that
he
should
*NL*
discover
only
some
faintly
traced
features
or
outline
of
the
*NL*
mother
and
the
child
,
slowly
fading
into
the
twilight
of
the
*NL*
woods
.
So
great
a
vicissitude
in
his
life
could
not
at
once
be
*NL*
received
as
real
.
But
there
was
Hester
,
clad
in
her
gray
robe
,
*NL*
still
standing
beside
the
tree-trunk
,
which
some
blast
had
*NL*
overthrown
a
long
antiquity
ago
,
and
which
time
had
ever
since
*NL*
been
covering
with
moss
,
so
that
these
two
fated
ones
,
with
*NL*
earth
's
heaviest
burden
on
them
,
might
there
sit
down
together
,
*NL*
and
find
a
single
hour
's
rest
and
solace
.
And
there
was
Pearl
,
*NL*
too
,
lightly
dancing
from
the
margin
of
the
brook
--
now
that
the
*NL*
intrusive
third
person
was
gone
--
and
taking
her
old
place
by
her
*NL*
mother
's
side
.
So
the
minister
had
not
fallen
asleep
and
*NL*
dreamed
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
free
his
mind
from
this
indistinctness
and
duplicity
*NL*
of
impression
,
which
vexed
it
with
a
strange
disquietude
,
he
*NL*
recalled
and
more
thoroughly
defined
the
plans
which
Hester
and
*NL*
himself
had
sketched
for
their
departure
.
It
had
been
determined
*NL*
between
them
that
the
Old
World
,
with
its
crowds
and
cities
,
*NL*
offered
them
a
more
eligible
shelter
and
concealment
than
the
*NL*
wilds
of
New
England
or
all
America
,
with
its
alternatives
of
an
*NL*
Indian
wigwam
,
or
the
few
settlements
of
Europeans
scattered
*NL*
thinly
along
the
sea-board
.
Not
to
speak
of
the
clergyman
's
*NL*
health
,
so
inadequate
to
sustain
the
hardships
of
a
forest
life
,
*NL*
his
native
gifts
,
his
culture
,
and
his
entire
development
would
*NL*
secure
him
a
home
only
in
the
midst
of
civilization
and
*NL*
refinement
;
the
higher
the
state
the
more
delicately
adapted
to
*NL*
it
the
man
.
In
furtherance
of
this
choice
,
it
so
happened
that
a
*NL*
ship
lay
in
the
harbour
;
one
of
those
unquestionable
cruisers
,
*NL*
frequent
at
that
day
,
which
,
without
being
absolutely
outlaws
of
*NL*
the
deep
,
yet
roamed
over
its
surface
with
a
remarkable
*NL*
irresponsibility
of
character
.
This
vessel
had
recently
arrived
*NL*
from
the
Spanish
Main
,
and
within
three
days
'
time
would
sail
*NL*
for
Bristol
.
Hester
Prynne
--
whose
vocation
,
as
a
self-enlisted
*NL*
Sister
of
Charity
,
had
brought
her
acquainted
with
the
captain
*NL*
and
crew
--
could
take
upon
herself
to
secure
the
passage
of
two
*NL*
individuals
and
a
child
with
all
the
secrecy
which
circumstances
*NL*
rendered
more
than
desirable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
had
inquired
of
Hester
,
with
no
little
interest
,
*NL*
the
precise
time
at
which
the
vessel
might
be
expected
to
*NL*
depart
.
It
would
probably
be
on
the
fourth
day
from
the
present
.
*NL*
``
This
is
most
fortunate
!
''
he
had
then
said
to
himself
.
Now
,
why
*NL*
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
considered
it
so
very
fortunate
we
*NL*
hesitate
to
reveal
.
Nevertheless
--
to
hold
nothing
back
from
the
*NL*
reader
--
it
was
because
,
on
the
third
day
from
the
present
,
he
*NL*
was
to
preach
the
Election
Sermon
;
and
,
as
such
an
occasion
*NL*
formed
an
honourable
epoch
in
the
life
of
a
New
England
*NL*
Clergyman
,
he
could
not
have
chanced
upon
a
more
suitable
mode
*NL*
and
time
of
terminating
his
professional
career
.
``
At
least
,
they
*NL*
shall
say
of
me
,
''
thought
this
exemplary
man
,
``
that
I
leave
no
*NL*
public
duty
unperformed
or
ill-performed
!
''
Sad
,
indeed
,
that
an
*NL*
introspection
so
profound
and
acute
as
this
poor
minister
's
*NL*
should
be
so
miserably
deceived
!
We
have
had
,
and
may
still
*NL*
have
,
worse
things
to
tell
of
him
;
but
none
,
we
apprehend
,
so
*NL*
pitiably
weak
;
no
evidence
,
at
once
so
slight
and
irrefragable
,
*NL*
of
a
subtle
disease
that
had
long
since
begun
to
eat
into
the
*NL*
real
substance
of
his
character
.
No
man
,
for
any
considerable
*NL*
period
,
can
wear
one
face
to
himself
and
another
to
the
*NL*
multitude
,
without
finally
getting
bewildered
as
to
which
may
be
*NL*
the
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
excitement
of
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
feelings
as
he
returned
from
*NL*
his
interview
with
Hester
,
lent
him
unaccustomed
physical
*NL*
energy
,
and
hurried
him
townward
at
a
rapid
pace
.
The
pathway
*NL*
among
the
woods
seemed
wilder
,
more
uncouth
with
its
rude
*NL*
natural
obstacles
,
and
less
trodden
by
the
foot
of
man
,
than
he
*NL*
remembered
it
on
his
outward
journey
.
But
he
leaped
across
the
*NL*
plashy
places
,
thrust
himself
through
the
clinging
underbrush
,
*NL*
climbed
the
ascent
,
plunged
into
the
hollow
,
and
overcame
,
in
*NL*
short
,
all
the
difficulties
of
the
track
,
with
an
unweariable
*NL*
activity
that
astonished
him
.
He
could
not
but
recall
how
*NL*
feebly
,
and
with
what
frequent
pauses
for
breath
he
had
toiled
*NL*
over
the
same
ground
,
only
two
days
before
.
As
he
drew
near
the
*NL*
town
,
he
took
an
impression
of
change
from
the
series
of
*NL*
familiar
objects
that
presented
themselves
.
It
seemed
not
*NL*
yesterday
,
not
one
,
not
two
,
but
many
days
,
or
even
years
ago
,
*NL*
since
he
had
quitted
them
.
There
,
indeed
,
was
each
former
trace
*NL*
of
the
street
,
as
he
remembered
it
,
and
all
the
peculiarities
of
*NL*
the
houses
,
with
the
due
multitude
of
gable-peaks
,
and
a
*NL*
weather-cock
at
every
point
where
his
memory
suggested
one
.
Not
*NL*
the
less
,
however
,
came
this
importunately
obtrusive
sense
of
*NL*
change
.
The
same
was
true
as
regarded
the
acquaintances
whom
he
*NL*
met
,
and
all
the
well-known
shapes
of
human
life
,
about
the
*NL*
little
town
.
They
looked
neither
older
nor
younger
now
;
the
*NL*
beards
of
the
aged
were
no
whiter
,
nor
could
the
creeping
babe
*NL*
of
yesterday
walk
on
his
feet
to-day
;
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
describe
in
what
respect
they
differed
from
the
individuals
on
*NL*
whom
he
had
so
recently
bestowed
a
parting
glance
;
and
yet
the
*NL*
minister
's
deepest
sense
seemed
to
inform
him
of
their
*NL*
mutability
.
A
similar
impression
struck
him
most
remarkably
as
*NL*
he
passed
under
the
walls
of
his
own
church
.
The
edifice
had
so
*NL*
very
strange
,
and
yet
so
familiar
an
aspect
,
that
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
's
mind
vibrated
between
two
ideas
;
either
that
he
had
*NL*
seen
it
only
in
a
dream
hitherto
,
or
that
he
was
merely
dreaming
*NL*
about
it
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
phenomenon
,
in
the
various
shapes
which
it
assumed
,
*NL*
indicated
no
external
change
,
but
so
sudden
and
important
a
*NL*
change
in
the
spectator
of
the
familiar
scene
,
that
the
*NL*
intervening
space
of
a
single
day
had
operated
on
his
*NL*
consciousness
like
the
lapse
of
years
.
The
minister
's
own
will
,
*NL*
and
Hester
's
will
,
and
the
fate
that
grew
between
them
,
had
*NL*
wrought
this
transformation
.
It
was
the
same
town
as
heretofore
,
*NL*
but
the
same
minister
returned
not
from
the
forest
.
He
might
*NL*
have
said
to
the
friends
who
greeted
him
--
``
I
am
not
the
man
for
*NL*
whom
you
take
me
!
I
left
him
yonder
in
the
forest
,
withdrawn
*NL*
into
a
secret
dell
,
by
a
mossy
tree
trunk
,
and
near
a
melancholy
*NL*
brook
!
Go
,
seek
your
minister
,
and
see
if
his
emaciated
figure
,
*NL*
his
thin
cheek
,
his
white
,
heavy
,
pain-wrinkled
brow
,
be
not
*NL*
flung
down
there
,
like
a
cast-off
garment
!
''
His
friends
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
would
still
have
insisted
with
him
--
``
Thou
art
thyself
the
*NL*
man
!
''
but
the
error
would
have
been
their
own
,
not
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Mr.
Dimmesdale
reached
home
,
his
inner
man
gave
him
other
*NL*
evidences
of
a
revolution
in
the
sphere
of
thought
and
feeling
.
*NL*
In
truth
,
nothing
short
of
a
total
change
of
dynasty
and
moral
*NL*
code
,
in
that
interior
kingdom
,
was
adequate
to
account
for
the
*NL*
impulses
now
communicated
to
the
unfortunate
and
startled
*NL*
minister
.
At
every
step
he
was
incited
to
do
some
strange
,
wild
,
*NL*
wicked
thing
or
other
,
with
a
sense
that
it
would
be
at
once
*NL*
involuntary
and
intentional
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
yet
growing
*NL*
out
of
a
profounder
self
than
that
which
opposed
the
impulse
.
*NL*
For
instance
,
he
met
one
of
his
own
deacons
.
The
good
old
man
*NL*
addressed
him
with
the
paternal
affection
and
patriarchal
*NL*
privilege
which
his
venerable
age
,
his
upright
and
holy
*NL*
character
,
and
his
station
in
the
church
,
entitled
him
to
use
*NL*
and
,
conjoined
with
this
,
the
deep
,
almost
worshipping
respect
,
*NL*
which
the
minister
's
professional
and
private
claims
alike
*NL*
demanded
.
Never
was
there
a
more
beautiful
example
of
how
the
*NL*
majesty
of
age
and
wisdom
may
comport
with
the
obeisance
and
*NL*
respect
enjoined
upon
it
,
as
from
a
lower
social
rank
,
and
*NL*
inferior
order
of
endowment
,
towards
a
higher
.
Now
,
during
a
*NL*
conversation
of
some
two
or
three
moments
between
the
Reverend
*NL*
Mr.
Dimmesdale
and
this
excellent
and
hoary-bearded
deacon
,
it
*NL*
was
only
by
the
most
careful
self-control
that
the
former
could
*NL*
refrain
from
uttering
certain
blasphemous
suggestions
that
rose
*NL*
into
his
mind
,
respecting
the
communion-supper
.
He
absolutely
*NL*
trembled
and
turned
pale
as
ashes
,
lest
his
tongue
should
wag
*NL*
itself
in
utterance
of
these
horrible
matters
,
and
plead
his
own
*NL*
consent
for
so
doing
,
without
his
having
fairly
given
it
.
And
,
*NL*
even
with
this
terror
in
his
heart
,
he
could
hardly
avoid
*NL*
laughing
,
to
imagine
how
the
sanctified
old
patriarchal
deacon
*NL*
would
have
been
petrified
by
his
minister
's
impiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
another
incident
of
the
same
nature
.
Hurrying
along
the
*NL*
street
,
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
encountered
the
eldest
*NL*
female
member
of
his
church
,
a
most
pious
and
exemplary
old
*NL*
dame
,
poor
,
widowed
,
lonely
,
and
with
a
heart
as
full
of
*NL*
reminiscences
about
her
dead
husband
and
children
,
and
her
dead
*NL*
friends
of
long
ago
,
as
a
burial-ground
is
full
of
storied
*NL*
gravestones
.
Yet
all
this
,
which
would
else
have
been
such
heavy
*NL*
sorrow
,
was
made
almost
a
solemn
joy
to
her
devout
old
soul
,
by
*NL*
religious
consolations
and
the
truths
of
Scripture
,
wherewith
*NL*
she
had
fed
herself
continually
for
more
than
thirty
years
.
And
*NL*
since
Mr.
Dimmesdale
had
taken
her
in
charge
,
the
good
grandam
's
*NL*
chief
earthly
comfort
--
which
,
unless
it
had
been
likewise
a
*NL*
heavenly
comfort
,
could
have
been
none
at
all
--
was
to
meet
her
*NL*
pastor
,
whether
casually
,
or
of
set
purpose
,
and
be
refreshed
*NL*
with
a
word
of
warm
,
fragrant
,
heaven-breathing
Gospel
truth
,
*NL*
from
his
beloved
lips
,
into
her
dulled
,
but
rapturously
*NL*
attentive
ear
.
But
,
on
this
occasion
,
up
to
the
moment
of
*NL*
putting
his
lips
to
the
old
woman
's
ear
,
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
as
the
*NL*
great
enemy
of
souls
would
have
it
,
could
recall
no
text
of
*NL*
Scripture
,
nor
aught
else
,
except
a
brief
,
pithy
,
and
,
as
it
*NL*
then
appeared
to
him
,
unanswerable
argument
against
the
*NL*
immortality
of
the
human
soul
.
The
instilment
thereof
into
her
*NL*
mind
would
probably
have
caused
this
aged
sister
to
drop
down
*NL*
dead
,
at
once
,
as
by
the
effect
of
an
intensely
poisonous
*NL*
infusion
.
What
he
really
did
whisper
,
the
minister
could
never
*NL*
afterwards
recollect
.
There
was
,
perhaps
,
a
fortunate
disorder
*NL*
in
his
utterance
,
which
failed
to
impart
any
distinct
idea
to
*NL*
the
good
widows
comprehension
,
or
which
Providence
interpreted
*NL*
after
a
method
of
its
own
.
Assuredly
,
as
the
minister
looked
*NL*
back
,
he
beheld
an
expression
of
divine
gratitude
and
ecstasy
*NL*
that
seemed
like
the
shine
of
the
celestial
city
on
her
face
,
so
*NL*
wrinkled
and
ashy
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
a
third
instance
.
After
parting
from
the
old
church
*NL*
member
,
he
met
the
youngest
sister
of
them
all
.
It
was
a
maiden
*NL*
newly-won
--
and
won
by
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
own
sermon
,
*NL*
on
the
Sabbath
after
his
vigil
--
to
barter
the
transitory
*NL*
pleasures
of
the
world
for
the
heavenly
hope
that
was
to
assume
*NL*
brighter
substance
as
life
grew
dark
around
her
,
and
which
would
*NL*
gild
the
utter
gloom
with
final
glory
.
She
was
fair
and
pure
as
*NL*
a
lily
that
had
bloomed
in
Paradise
.
The
minister
knew
well
that
*NL*
he
was
himself
enshrined
within
the
stainless
sanctity
of
her
*NL*
heart
,
which
hung
its
snowy
curtains
about
his
image
,
imparting
*NL*
to
religion
the
warmth
of
love
,
and
to
love
a
religious
purity
.
*NL*
Satan
,
that
afternoon
,
had
surely
led
the
poor
young
girl
away
*NL*
from
her
mother
's
side
,
and
thrown
her
into
the
pathway
of
this
*NL*
sorely
tempted
,
or
--
shall
we
not
rather
say
?
--
this
lost
and
*NL*
desperate
man
.
As
she
drew
nigh
,
the
arch-fiend
whispered
him
to
*NL*
condense
into
small
compass
,
and
drop
into
her
tender
bosom
a
*NL*
germ
of
evil
that
would
be
sure
to
blossom
darkly
soon
,
and
bear
*NL*
black
fruit
betimes
.
Such
was
his
sense
of
power
over
this
*NL*
virgin
soul
,
trusting
him
as
she
did
,
that
the
minister
felt
*NL*
potent
to
blight
all
the
field
of
innocence
with
but
one
wicked
*NL*
look
,
and
develop
all
its
opposite
with
but
a
word
.
So
--
with
a
*NL*
mightier
struggle
than
he
had
yet
sustained
--
he
held
his
Geneva
*NL*
cloak
before
his
face
,
and
hurried
onward
,
making
no
sign
of
*NL*
recognition
,
and
leaving
the
young
sister
to
digest
his
rudeness
*NL*
as
she
might
.
She
ransacked
her
conscience
--
which
was
full
of
*NL*
harmless
little
matters
,
like
her
pocket
or
her
work-bag
--
and
*NL*
took
herself
to
task
,
poor
thing
!
for
a
thousand
imaginary
*NL*
faults
,
and
went
about
her
household
duties
with
swollen
eyelids
*NL*
the
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
minister
had
time
to
celebrate
his
victory
over
this
*NL*
last
temptation
,
he
was
conscious
of
another
impulse
,
more
*NL*
ludicrous
,
and
almost
as
horrible
.
It
was
--
we
blush
to
tell
*NL*
it
--
it
was
to
stop
short
in
the
road
,
and
teach
some
very
wicked
*NL*
words
to
a
knot
of
little
Puritan
children
who
were
playing
*NL*
there
,
and
had
but
just
begun
to
talk
.
Denying
himself
this
*NL*
freak
,
as
unworthy
of
his
cloth
,
he
met
a
drunken
seaman
,
one
of
*NL*
the
ship
's
crew
from
the
Spanish
Main
.
And
here
,
since
he
had
so
*NL*
valiantly
forborne
all
other
wickedness
,
poor
Mr.
Dimmesdale
*NL*
longed
at
least
to
shake
hands
with
the
tarry
black-guard
,
and
*NL*
recreate
himself
with
a
few
improper
jests
,
such
as
dissolute
*NL*
sailors
so
abound
with
,
and
a
volley
of
good
,
round
,
solid
,
*NL*
satisfactory
,
and
heaven-defying
oaths
!
It
was
not
so
much
a
*NL*
better
principle
,
as
partly
his
natural
good
taste
,
and
still
*NL*
more
his
buckramed
habit
of
clerical
decorum
,
that
carried
him
*NL*
safely
through
the
latter
crisis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
that
haunts
and
tempts
me
thus
?
''
cried
the
minister
*NL*
to
himself
,
at
length
,
pausing
in
the
street
,
and
striking
his
*NL*
hand
against
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
mad
?
or
am
I
given
over
utterly
to
the
fiend
?
Did
I
make
*NL*
a
contract
with
him
in
the
forest
,
and
sign
it
with
my
blood
?
*NL*
And
does
he
now
summon
me
to
its
fulfilment
,
by
suggesting
the
*NL*
performance
of
every
wickedness
which
his
most
foul
imagination
*NL*
can
conceive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
thus
communed
*NL*
with
himself
,
and
struck
his
forehead
with
his
hand
,
old
*NL*
Mistress
Hibbins
,
the
reputed
witch-lady
,
is
said
to
have
been
*NL*
passing
by
.
She
made
a
very
grand
appearance
,
having
on
a
high
*NL*
head-dress
,
a
rich
gown
of
velvet
,
and
a
ruff
done
up
with
the
*NL*
famous
yellow
starch
,
of
which
Anne
Turner
,
her
especial
friend
,
*NL*
had
taught
her
the
secret
,
before
this
last
good
lady
had
been
*NL*
hanged
for
Sir
Thomas
Overbury
's
murder
.
Whether
the
witch
had
*NL*
read
the
minister
's
thoughts
or
no
,
she
came
to
a
full
stop
,
*NL*
looked
shrewdly
into
his
face
,
smiled
craftily
,
and
--
though
*NL*
little
given
to
converse
with
clergymen
--
began
a
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
reverend
sir
,
you
have
made
a
visit
into
the
forest
,
''
*NL*
observed
the
witch-lady
,
nodding
her
high
head-dress
at
him
.
*NL*
``
The
next
time
I
pray
you
to
allow
me
only
a
fair
warning
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
be
proud
to
bear
you
company
.
Without
taking
overmuch
upon
*NL*
myself
my
good
word
will
go
far
towards
gaining
any
strange
*NL*
gentleman
a
fair
reception
from
yonder
potentate
you
wot
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
profess
,
madam
,
''
answered
the
clergyman
,
with
a
grave
*NL*
obeisance
,
such
as
the
lady
's
rank
demanded
,
and
his
own
good
*NL*
breeding
made
imperative
--
``
I
profess
,
on
my
conscience
and
*NL*
character
,
that
I
am
utterly
bewildered
as
touching
the
purport
*NL*
of
your
words
!
I
went
not
into
the
forest
to
seek
a
potentate
,
*NL*
neither
do
I
,
at
any
future
time
,
design
a
visit
thither
,
with
a
*NL*
view
to
gaining
the
favour
of
such
personage
.
My
one
sufficient
*NL*
object
was
to
greet
that
pious
friend
of
mine
,
the
Apostle
*NL*
Eliot
,
and
rejoice
with
him
over
the
many
precious
souls
he
hath
*NL*
won
from
heathendom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
cackled
the
old
witch-lady
,
still
nodding
her
high
*NL*
head-dress
at
the
minister
.
``
Well
,
well
!
we
must
needs
talk
thus
*NL*
in
the
daytime
!
You
carry
it
off
like
an
old
hand
!
But
at
*NL*
midnight
,
and
in
the
forest
,
we
shall
have
other
talk
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
on
with
her
aged
stateliness
,
but
often
turning
back
*NL*
her
head
and
smiling
at
him
,
like
one
willing
to
recognise
a
*NL*
secret
intimacy
of
connexion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
then
sold
myself
,
''
thought
the
minister
,
``
to
the
fiend
*NL*
whom
,
if
men
say
true
,
this
yellow-starched
and
velveted
old
hag
*NL*
has
chosen
for
her
prince
and
master
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wretched
minister
!
He
had
made
a
bargain
very
like
it
!
*NL*
Tempted
by
a
dream
of
happiness
,
he
had
yielded
himself
with
*NL*
deliberate
choice
,
as
he
had
never
done
before
,
to
what
he
knew
*NL*
was
deadly
sin
.
And
the
infectious
poison
of
that
sin
had
been
*NL*
thus
rapidly
diffused
throughout
his
moral
system
.
It
had
*NL*
stupefied
all
blessed
impulses
,
and
awakened
into
vivid
life
the
*NL*
whole
brotherhood
of
bad
ones
.
Scorn
,
bitterness
,
unprovoked
*NL*
malignity
,
gratuitous
desire
of
ill
,
ridicule
of
whatever
was
*NL*
good
and
holy
,
all
awoke
to
tempt
,
even
while
they
frightened
*NL*
him
.
And
his
encounter
with
old
Mistress
Hibbins
,
if
it
were
a
*NL*
real
incident
,
did
but
show
its
sympathy
and
fellowship
with
*NL*
wicked
mortals
,
and
the
world
of
perverted
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
by
this
time
reached
his
dwelling
on
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
burial
ground
,
and
,
hastening
up
the
stairs
,
took
refuge
in
his
*NL*
study
.
The
minister
was
glad
to
have
reached
this
shelter
,
*NL*
without
first
betraying
himself
to
the
world
by
any
of
those
*NL*
strange
and
wicked
eccentricities
to
which
he
had
been
*NL*
continually
impelled
while
passing
through
the
streets
.
He
*NL*
entered
the
accustomed
room
,
and
looked
around
him
on
its
books
,
*NL*
its
windows
,
its
fireplace
,
and
the
tapestried
comfort
of
the
*NL*
walls
,
with
the
same
perception
of
strangeness
that
had
haunted
*NL*
him
throughout
his
walk
from
the
forest
dell
into
the
town
and
*NL*
thitherward
.
Here
he
had
studied
and
written
;
here
gone
through
*NL*
fast
and
vigil
,
and
come
forth
half
alive
;
here
striven
to
pray
;
*NL*
here
borne
a
hundred
thousand
agonies
!
There
was
the
Bible
,
in
*NL*
its
rich
old
Hebrew
,
with
Moses
and
the
Prophets
speaking
to
*NL*
him
,
and
God
's
voice
through
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
on
the
table
,
with
the
inky
pen
beside
it
,
was
an
*NL*
unfinished
sermon
,
with
a
sentence
broken
in
the
midst
,
where
*NL*
his
thoughts
had
ceased
to
gush
out
upon
the
page
two
days
*NL*
before
.
He
knew
that
it
was
himself
,
the
thin
and
white-cheeked
*NL*
minister
,
who
had
done
and
suffered
these
things
,
and
written
*NL*
thus
far
into
the
Election
Sermon
!
But
he
seemed
to
stand
apart
,
*NL*
and
eye
this
former
self
with
scornful
pitying
,
but
half-envious
*NL*
curiosity
.
That
self
was
gone
.
Another
man
had
returned
out
of
*NL*
the
forest
--
a
wiser
one
--
with
a
knowledge
of
hidden
mysteries
*NL*
which
the
simplicity
of
the
former
never
could
have
reached
.
A
*NL*
bitter
kind
of
knowledge
that
!
*NL*
*NL*
While
occupied
with
these
reflections
,
a
knock
came
at
the
door
*NL*
of
the
study
,
and
the
minister
said
,
``
Come
in
!
''
--
not
wholly
*NL*
devoid
of
an
idea
that
he
might
behold
an
evil
spirit
.
And
so
he
*NL*
did
!
It
was
old
Roger
Chillingworth
that
entered
.
The
minister
*NL*
stood
white
and
speechless
,
with
one
hand
on
the
Hebrew
*NL*
Scriptures
,
and
the
other
spread
upon
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Welcome
home
,
reverend
sir
,
''
said
the
physician
``
And
how
found
*NL*
you
that
godly
man
,
the
Apostle
Eliot
?
But
methinks
,
dear
sir
,
*NL*
you
look
pale
,
as
if
the
travel
through
the
wilderness
had
been
*NL*
too
sore
for
you
.
Will
not
my
aid
be
requisite
to
put
you
in
*NL*
heart
and
strength
to
preach
your
Election
Sermon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
I
think
not
so
,
''
rejoined
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
.
``
My
*NL*
journey
,
and
the
sight
of
the
holy
Apostle
yonder
,
and
the
free
*NL*
air
which
I
have
breathed
have
done
me
good
,
after
so
long
*NL*
confinement
in
my
study
.
I
think
to
need
no
more
of
your
drugs
,
*NL*
my
kind
physician
,
good
though
they
be
,
and
administered
by
a
*NL*
friendly
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
Roger
Chillingworth
was
looking
at
the
minister
*NL*
with
the
grave
and
intent
regard
of
a
physician
towards
his
*NL*
patient
.
But
,
in
spite
of
this
outward
show
,
the
latter
was
*NL*
almost
convinced
of
the
old
man
's
knowledge
,
or
,
at
least
,
his
*NL*
confident
suspicion
,
with
respect
to
his
own
interview
with
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
.
The
physician
knew
then
that
in
the
minister
's
*NL*
regard
he
was
no
longer
a
trusted
friend
,
but
his
bitterest
*NL*
enemy
.
So
much
being
known
,
it
would
appear
natural
that
a
part
*NL*
of
it
should
be
expressed
.
It
is
singular
,
however
,
how
long
a
*NL*
time
often
passes
before
words
embody
things
;
and
with
what
*NL*
security
two
persons
,
who
choose
to
avoid
a
certain
subject
,
may
*NL*
approach
its
very
verge
,
and
retire
without
disturbing
it
.
Thus
*NL*
the
minister
felt
no
apprehension
that
Roger
Chillingworth
would
*NL*
touch
,
in
express
words
,
upon
the
real
position
which
they
*NL*
sustained
towards
one
another
.
Yet
did
the
physician
,
in
his
*NL*
dark
way
,
creep
frightfully
near
the
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
it
not
better
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
you
use
my
poor
skill
*NL*
tonight
?
Verily
,
dear
sir
,
we
must
take
pains
to
make
you
strong
*NL*
and
vigorous
for
this
occasion
of
the
Election
discourse
.
The
*NL*
people
look
for
great
things
from
you
,
apprehending
that
another
*NL*
year
may
come
about
and
find
their
pastor
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
another
world
,
''
replied
the
minister
with
pious
*NL*
resignation
.
``
Heaven
grant
it
be
a
better
one
;
for
,
in
good
*NL*
sooth
,
I
hardly
think
to
tarry
with
my
flock
through
the
*NL*
flitting
seasons
of
another
year
!
But
touching
your
medicine
,
*NL*
kind
sir
,
in
my
present
frame
of
body
I
need
it
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
joy
to
hear
it
,
''
answered
the
physician
.
``
It
may
be
that
my
*NL*
remedies
,
so
long
administered
in
vain
,
begin
now
to
take
due
*NL*
effect
.
Happy
man
were
I
,
and
well
deserving
of
New
England
's
*NL*
gratitude
,
could
I
achieve
this
cure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
from
my
heart
,
most
watchful
friend
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
with
a
solemn
smile
.
``
I
thank
you
,
and
*NL*
can
but
requite
your
good
deeds
with
my
prayers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
man
's
prayers
are
golden
recompense
!
''
rejoined
old
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
,
as
he
took
his
leave
.
``
Yea
,
they
are
the
current
*NL*
gold
coin
of
the
New
Jerusalem
,
with
the
King
's
own
mint
mark
on
*NL*
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
,
the
minister
summoned
a
servant
of
the
house
,
and
*NL*
requested
food
,
which
,
being
set
before
him
,
he
ate
with
*NL*
ravenous
appetite
.
Then
flinging
the
already
written
pages
of
*NL*
the
Election
Sermon
into
the
fire
,
he
forthwith
began
another
,
*NL*
which
he
wrote
with
such
an
impulsive
flow
of
thought
and
*NL*
emotion
,
that
he
fancied
himself
inspired
;
and
only
wondered
*NL*
that
Heaven
should
see
fit
to
transmit
the
grand
and
solemn
*NL*
music
of
its
oracles
through
so
foul
an
organ
pipe
as
he
.
*NL*
However
,
leaving
that
mystery
to
solve
itself
,
or
go
unsolved
*NL*
for
ever
,
he
drove
his
task
onward
with
earnest
haste
and
*NL*
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
night
fled
away
,
as
if
it
were
a
winged
steed
,
and
he
*NL*
careering
on
it
;
morning
came
,
and
peeped
,
blushing
,
through
the
*NL*
curtains
;
and
at
last
sunrise
threw
a
golden
beam
into
the
*NL*
study
,
and
laid
it
right
across
the
minister
's
bedazzled
eyes
.
*NL*
There
he
was
,
with
the
pen
still
between
his
fingers
,
and
a
*NL*
vast
,
immeasurable
tract
of
written
space
behind
him
!
*NL*

XXI
.
THE
NEW
ENGLAND
HOLIDAY
*NL*
*NL*
Betimes
in
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
the
new
Governor
was
*NL*
to
receive
his
office
at
the
hands
of
the
people
,
Hester
Prynne
*NL*
and
little
Pearl
came
into
the
market-place
.
It
was
already
*NL*
thronged
with
the
craftsmen
and
other
plebeian
inhabitants
of
*NL*
the
town
,
in
considerable
numbers
,
among
whom
,
likewise
,
were
*NL*
many
rough
figures
,
whose
attire
of
deer-skins
marked
them
as
*NL*
belonging
to
some
of
the
forest
settlements
,
which
surrounded
*NL*
the
little
metropolis
of
the
colony
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
public
holiday
,
as
on
all
other
occasions
for
seven
*NL*
years
past
,
Hester
was
clad
in
a
garment
of
coarse
gray
cloth
.
*NL*
Not
more
by
its
hue
than
by
some
indescribable
peculiarity
in
*NL*
its
fashion
,
it
had
the
effect
of
making
her
fade
personally
out
*NL*
of
sight
and
outline
;
while
again
the
scarlet
letter
brought
her
*NL*
back
from
this
twilight
indistinctness
,
and
revealed
her
under
*NL*
the
moral
aspect
of
its
own
illumination
.
Her
face
,
so
long
*NL*
familiar
to
the
townspeople
,
showed
the
marble
quietude
which
*NL*
they
were
accustomed
to
behold
there
.
It
was
like
a
mask
;
or
,
*NL*
rather
like
the
frozen
calmness
of
a
dead
woman
's
features
;
*NL*
owing
this
dreary
resemblance
to
the
fact
that
Hester
was
*NL*
actually
dead
,
in
respect
to
any
claim
of
sympathy
,
and
had
*NL*
departed
out
of
the
world
with
which
she
still
seemed
to
mingle
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
,
on
this
one
day
,
that
there
was
an
expression
*NL*
unseen
before
,
nor
,
indeed
,
vivid
enough
to
be
detected
now
;
*NL*
unless
some
preternaturally
gifted
observer
should
have
first
*NL*
read
the
heart
,
and
have
afterwards
sought
a
corresponding
*NL*
development
in
the
countenance
and
mien
.
Such
a
spiritual
seer
*NL*
might
have
conceived
,
that
,
after
sustaining
the
gaze
of
the
*NL*
multitude
through
several
miserable
years
as
a
necessity
,
a
*NL*
penance
,
and
something
which
it
was
a
stern
religion
to
endure
,
*NL*
she
now
,
for
one
last
time
more
,
encountered
it
freely
and
*NL*
voluntarily
,
in
order
to
convert
what
had
so
long
been
agony
*NL*
into
a
kind
of
triumph
.
``
Look
your
last
on
the
scarlet
letter
*NL*
and
its
wearer
!
''
--
the
people
's
victim
and
lifelong
bond-slave
,
*NL*
as
they
fancied
her
,
might
say
to
them
.
``
Yet
a
little
while
,
and
*NL*
she
will
be
beyond
your
reach
!
A
few
hours
longer
and
the
deep
,
*NL*
mysterious
ocean
will
quench
and
hide
for
ever
the
symbol
which
*NL*
ye
have
caused
to
burn
on
her
bosom
!
''
Nor
were
it
an
*NL*
inconsistency
too
improbable
to
be
assigned
to
human
nature
,
*NL*
should
we
suppose
a
feeling
of
regret
in
Hester
's
mind
,
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
she
was
about
to
win
her
freedom
from
the
pain
which
*NL*
had
been
thus
deeply
incorporated
with
her
being
.
Might
there
*NL*
not
be
an
irresistible
desire
to
quaff
a
last
,
long
,
breathless
*NL*
draught
of
the
cup
of
wormwood
and
aloes
,
with
which
nearly
all
*NL*
her
years
of
womanhood
had
been
perpetually
flavoured
.
The
wine
*NL*
of
life
,
henceforth
to
be
presented
to
her
lips
,
must
be
indeed
*NL*
rich
,
delicious
,
and
exhilarating
,
in
its
chased
and
golden
*NL*
beaker
,
or
else
leave
an
inevitable
and
weary
languor
,
after
the
*NL*
lees
of
bitterness
wherewith
she
had
been
drugged
,
as
with
a
*NL*
cordial
of
intensest
potency
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
was
decked
out
with
airy
gaiety
.
It
would
have
been
*NL*
impossible
to
guess
that
this
bright
and
sunny
apparition
owed
*NL*
its
existence
to
the
shape
of
gloomy
gray
;
or
that
a
fancy
,
at
*NL*
once
so
gorgeous
and
so
delicate
as
must
have
been
requisite
to
*NL*
contrive
the
child
's
apparel
,
was
the
same
that
had
achieved
a
*NL*
task
perhaps
more
difficult
,
in
imparting
so
distinct
a
*NL*
peculiarity
to
Hester
's
simple
robe
.
The
dress
,
so
proper
was
it
*NL*
to
little
Pearl
,
seemed
an
effluence
,
or
inevitable
development
*NL*
and
outward
manifestation
of
her
character
,
no
more
to
be
*NL*
separated
from
her
than
the
many-hued
brilliancy
from
a
*NL*
butterfly
's
wing
,
or
the
painted
glory
from
the
leaf
of
a
bright
*NL*
flower
.
As
with
these
,
so
with
the
child
;
her
garb
was
all
of
*NL*
one
idea
with
her
nature
.
On
this
eventful
day
,
moreover
,
there
*NL*
was
a
certain
singular
inquietude
and
excitement
in
her
mood
,
*NL*
resembling
nothing
so
much
as
the
shimmer
of
a
diamond
,
that
*NL*
sparkles
and
flashes
with
the
varied
throbbings
of
the
breast
on
*NL*
which
it
is
displayed
.
Children
have
always
a
sympathy
in
the
*NL*
agitations
of
those
connected
with
them
:
always
,
especially
,
a
*NL*
sense
of
any
trouble
or
impending
revolution
,
of
whatever
kind
,
*NL*
in
domestic
circumstances
;
and
therefore
Pearl
,
who
was
the
gem
*NL*
on
her
mother
's
unquiet
bosom
,
betrayed
,
by
the
very
dance
of
*NL*
her
spirits
,
the
emotions
which
none
could
detect
in
the
marble
*NL*
passiveness
of
Hester
's
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
effervescence
made
her
flit
with
a
bird-like
movement
,
*NL*
rather
than
walk
by
her
mother
's
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
broke
continually
into
shouts
of
a
wild
,
inarticulate
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
piercing
music
.
When
they
reached
the
market-place
,
*NL*
she
became
still
more
restless
,
on
perceiving
the
stir
and
*NL*
bustle
that
enlivened
the
spot
;
for
it
was
usually
more
like
the
*NL*
broad
and
lonesome
green
before
a
village
meeting-house
,
than
*NL*
the
centre
of
a
town
's
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
is
this
,
mother
?
''
cried
she
.
``
Wherefore
have
all
the
*NL*
people
left
their
work
to-day
?
Is
it
a
play-day
for
the
whole
*NL*
world
?
See
,
there
is
the
blacksmith
!
He
has
washed
his
sooty
*NL*
face
,
and
put
on
his
Sabbath-day
clothes
,
and
looks
as
if
he
*NL*
would
gladly
be
merry
,
if
any
kind
body
would
only
teach
him
*NL*
how
!
And
there
is
Master
Brackett
,
the
old
jailer
,
nodding
and
*NL*
smiling
at
me
.
Why
does
he
do
so
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
remembers
thee
a
little
babe
,
my
child
,
''
answered
Hester
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
should
not
nod
and
smile
at
me
,
for
all
that
--
the
black
,
*NL*
grim
,
ugly-eyed
old
man
!
''
said
Pearl
.
``
He
may
nod
at
thee
,
if
he
*NL*
will
;
for
thou
art
clad
in
gray
,
and
wearest
the
scarlet
letter
.
*NL*
But
see
,
mother
,
how
many
faces
of
strange
people
,
and
Indians
*NL*
among
them
,
and
sailors
!
What
have
they
all
come
to
do
,
here
in
*NL*
the
market-place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wait
to
see
the
procession
pass
,
''
said
Hester
.
``
For
the
*NL*
Governor
and
the
magistrates
are
to
go
by
,
and
the
ministers
,
*NL*
and
all
the
great
people
and
good
people
,
with
the
music
and
the
*NL*
soldiers
marching
before
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
the
minister
be
there
?
''
asked
Pearl
.
``
And
will
he
*NL*
hold
out
both
his
hands
to
me
,
as
when
thou
ledst
me
to
him
*NL*
from
the
brook-side
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
be
there
,
child
,
''
answered
her
mother
,
``
but
he
will
not
*NL*
greet
thee
to-day
,
nor
must
thou
greet
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
strange
,
sad
man
is
he
!
''
said
the
child
,
as
if
speaking
*NL*
partly
to
herself
.
``
In
the
dark
nighttime
he
calls
us
to
him
,
*NL*
and
holds
thy
hand
and
mine
,
as
when
we
stood
with
him
on
the
*NL*
scaffold
yonder
!
And
in
the
deep
forest
,
where
only
the
old
*NL*
trees
can
hear
,
and
the
strip
of
sky
see
it
,
he
talks
with
thee
,
*NL*
sitting
on
a
heap
of
moss
!
And
he
kisses
my
forehead
,
too
,
so
*NL*
that
the
little
brook
would
hardly
wash
it
off
!
But
,
here
,
in
*NL*
the
sunny
day
,
and
among
all
the
people
,
he
knows
us
not
;
nor
*NL*
must
we
know
him
!
A
strange
,
sad
man
is
he
,
with
his
hand
always
*NL*
over
his
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
,
Pearl
--
thou
understandest
not
these
things
,
''
said
her
*NL*
mother
.
``
Think
not
now
of
the
minister
,
but
look
about
thee
,
and
*NL*
see
how
cheery
is
everybody
's
face
to-day
.
The
children
have
*NL*
come
from
their
schools
,
and
the
grown
people
from
their
*NL*
workshops
and
their
fields
,
on
purpose
to
be
happy
,
for
,
to-day
,
*NL*
a
new
man
is
beginning
to
rule
over
them
;
and
so
--
as
has
been
*NL*
the
custom
of
mankind
ever
since
a
nation
was
first
*NL*
gathered
--
they
make
merry
and
rejoice
:
as
if
a
good
and
golden
*NL*
year
were
at
length
to
pass
over
the
poor
old
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
Hester
said
,
in
regard
to
the
unwonted
jollity
that
*NL*
brightened
the
faces
of
the
people
.
Into
this
festal
season
of
*NL*
the
year
--
as
it
already
was
,
and
continued
to
be
during
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
two
centuries
--
the
Puritans
compressed
whatever
*NL*
mirth
and
public
joy
they
deemed
allowable
to
human
infirmity
;
*NL*
thereby
so
far
dispelling
the
customary
cloud
,
that
,
for
the
*NL*
space
of
a
single
holiday
,
they
appeared
scarcely
more
grave
*NL*
than
most
other
communities
at
a
period
of
general
affliction
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
perhaps
exaggerate
the
gray
or
sable
tinge
,
which
*NL*
undoubtedly
characterized
the
mood
and
manners
of
the
age
.
The
*NL*
persons
now
in
the
market-place
of
Boston
had
not
been
born
to
*NL*
an
inheritance
of
Puritanic
gloom
.
They
were
native
Englishmen
,
*NL*
whose
fathers
had
lived
in
the
sunny
richness
of
the
Elizabethan
*NL*
epoch
;
a
time
when
the
life
of
England
,
viewed
as
one
great
*NL*
mass
,
would
appear
to
have
been
as
stately
,
magnificent
,
and
*NL*
joyous
,
as
the
world
has
ever
witnessed
.
Had
they
followed
their
*NL*
hereditary
taste
,
the
New
England
settlers
would
have
*NL*
illustrated
all
events
of
public
importance
by
bonfires
,
*NL*
banquets
,
pageantries
,
and
processions
.
Nor
would
it
have
been
*NL*
impracticable
,
in
the
observance
of
majestic
ceremonies
,
to
*NL*
combine
mirthful
recreation
with
solemnity
,
and
give
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
a
grotesque
and
brilliant
embroidery
to
the
great
robe
of
*NL*
state
,
which
a
nation
,
at
such
festivals
,
puts
on
.
There
was
*NL*
some
shadow
of
an
attempt
of
this
kind
in
the
mode
of
*NL*
celebrating
the
day
on
which
the
political
year
of
the
colony
*NL*
commenced
.
The
dim
reflection
of
a
remembered
splendour
,
a
*NL*
colourless
and
manifold
diluted
repetition
of
what
they
had
*NL*
beheld
in
proud
old
London
--
we
will
not
say
at
a
royal
*NL*
coronation
,
but
at
a
Lord
Mayor
's
show
--
might
be
traced
in
the
*NL*
customs
which
our
forefathers
instituted
,
with
reference
to
the
*NL*
annual
installation
of
magistrates
.
The
fathers
and
founders
of
*NL*
the
commonwealth
--
the
statesman
,
the
priest
,
and
the
*NL*
soldier
--
seemed
it
a
duty
then
to
assume
the
outward
state
and
*NL*
majesty
,
which
,
in
accordance
with
antique
style
,
was
looked
*NL*
upon
as
the
proper
garb
of
public
and
social
eminence
.
All
came
*NL*
forth
to
move
in
procession
before
the
people
's
eye
,
and
thus
*NL*
impart
a
needed
dignity
to
the
simple
framework
of
a
government
*NL*
so
newly
constructed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
too
,
the
people
were
countenanced
,
if
not
encouraged
,
in
*NL*
relaxing
the
severe
and
close
application
to
their
various
modes
*NL*
of
rugged
industry
,
which
at
all
other
times
,
seemed
of
the
same
*NL*
piece
and
material
with
their
religion
.
Here
,
it
is
true
,
were
*NL*
none
of
the
appliances
which
popular
merriment
would
so
readily
*NL*
have
found
in
the
England
of
Elizabeth
's
time
,
or
that
of
*NL*
James
--
no
rude
shows
of
a
theatrical
kind
;
no
minstrel
,
with
his
*NL*
harp
and
legendary
ballad
,
nor
gleeman
with
an
ape
dancing
to
*NL*
his
music
;
no
juggler
,
with
his
tricks
of
mimic
witchcraft
;
no
*NL*
Merry
Andrew
,
to
stir
up
the
multitude
with
jests
,
perhaps
a
*NL*
hundred
years
old
,
but
still
effective
,
by
their
appeals
to
the
*NL*
very
broadest
sources
of
mirthful
sympathy
.
All
such
professors
*NL*
of
the
several
branches
of
jocularity
would
have
been
sternly
*NL*
repressed
,
not
only
by
the
rigid
discipline
of
law
,
but
by
the
*NL*
general
sentiment
which
give
law
its
vitality
.
Not
the
less
,
*NL*
however
,
the
great
,
honest
face
of
the
people
smiled
--
grimly
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
but
widely
too
.
Nor
were
sports
wanting
,
such
as
the
*NL*
colonists
had
witnessed
,
and
shared
in
,
long
ago
,
at
the
country
*NL*
fairs
and
on
the
village-greens
of
England
;
and
which
it
was
*NL*
thought
well
to
keep
alive
on
this
new
soil
,
for
the
sake
of
the
*NL*
courage
and
manliness
that
were
essential
in
them
.
Wrestling
*NL*
matches
,
in
the
different
fashions
of
Cornwall
and
Devonshire
,
*NL*
were
seen
here
and
there
about
the
market-place
;
in
one
corner
,
*NL*
there
was
a
friendly
bout
at
quarterstaff
;
and
--
what
attracted
*NL*
most
interest
of
all
--
on
the
platform
of
the
pillory
,
already
so
*NL*
noted
in
our
pages
,
two
masters
of
defence
were
commencing
an
*NL*
exhibition
with
the
buckler
and
broadsword
.
But
,
much
to
the
*NL*
disappointment
of
the
crowd
,
this
latter
business
was
broken
off
*NL*
by
the
interposition
of
the
town
beadle
,
who
had
no
idea
of
*NL*
permitting
the
majesty
of
the
law
to
be
violated
by
such
an
*NL*
abuse
of
one
of
its
consecrated
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
not
be
too
much
to
affirm
,
on
the
whole
,
-LRB-
the
people
*NL*
being
then
in
the
first
stages
of
joyless
deportment
,
and
the
*NL*
offspring
of
sires
who
had
known
how
to
be
merry
,
in
their
day
-RRB-
,
*NL*
that
they
would
compare
favourably
,
in
point
of
holiday
keeping
,
*NL*
with
their
descendants
,
even
at
so
long
an
interval
as
*NL*
ourselves
.
Their
immediate
posterity
,
the
generation
next
to
the
*NL*
early
emigrants
,
wore
the
blackest
shade
of
Puritanism
,
and
so
*NL*
darkened
the
national
visage
with
it
,
that
all
the
subsequent
*NL*
years
have
not
sufficed
to
clear
it
up
.
We
have
yet
to
learn
*NL*
again
the
forgotten
art
of
gaiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
picture
of
human
life
in
the
market-place
,
though
its
*NL*
general
tint
was
the
sad
gray
,
brown
,
or
black
of
the
English
*NL*
emigrants
,
was
yet
enlivened
by
some
diversity
of
hue
.
A
party
*NL*
of
Indians
--
in
their
savage
finery
of
curiously
embroidered
*NL*
deerskin
robes
,
wampum-belts
,
red
and
yellow
ochre
,
and
*NL*
feathers
,
and
armed
with
the
bow
and
arrow
and
stone-headed
*NL*
spear
--
stood
apart
with
countenances
of
inflexible
gravity
,
*NL*
beyond
what
even
the
Puritan
aspect
could
attain
.
Nor
,
wild
as
*NL*
were
these
painted
barbarians
,
were
they
the
wildest
feature
of
*NL*
the
scene
.
This
distinction
could
more
justly
be
claimed
by
some
*NL*
mariners
--
a
part
of
the
crew
of
the
vessel
from
the
Spanish
*NL*
Main
--
who
had
come
ashore
to
see
the
humours
of
Election
Day
.
*NL*
They
were
rough-looking
desperadoes
,
with
sun-blackened
faces
,
*NL*
and
an
immensity
of
beard
;
their
wide
short
trousers
were
*NL*
confined
about
the
waist
by
belts
,
often
clasped
with
a
rough
*NL*
plate
of
gold
,
and
sustaining
always
a
long
knife
,
and
in
some
*NL*
instances
,
a
sword
.
From
beneath
their
broad-brimmed
hats
of
*NL*
palm-leaf
,
gleamed
eyes
which
,
even
in
good-nature
and
*NL*
merriment
,
had
a
kind
of
animal
ferocity
.
They
transgressed
*NL*
without
fear
or
scruple
,
the
rules
of
behaviour
that
were
*NL*
binding
on
all
others
:
smoking
tobacco
under
the
beadle
's
very
*NL*
nose
,
although
each
whiff
would
have
cost
a
townsman
a
shilling
;
*NL*
and
quaffing
at
their
pleasure
,
draughts
of
wine
or
aqua-vitae
*NL*
from
pocket
flasks
,
which
they
freely
tendered
to
the
gaping
*NL*
crowd
around
them
.
It
remarkably
characterised
the
incomplete
*NL*
morality
of
the
age
,
rigid
as
we
call
it
,
that
a
licence
was
*NL*
allowed
the
seafaring
class
,
not
merely
for
their
freaks
on
*NL*
shore
,
but
for
far
more
desperate
deeds
on
their
proper
element
.
*NL*
The
sailor
of
that
day
would
go
near
to
be
arraigned
as
a
pirate
*NL*
in
our
own
.
There
could
be
little
doubt
,
for
instance
,
that
this
*NL*
very
ship
's
crew
,
though
no
unfavourable
specimens
of
the
*NL*
nautical
brotherhood
,
had
been
guilty
,
as
we
should
phrase
it
,
*NL*
of
depredations
on
the
Spanish
commerce
,
such
as
would
have
*NL*
perilled
all
their
necks
in
a
modern
court
of
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
sea
in
those
old
times
heaved
,
swelled
,
and
foamed
very
*NL*
much
at
its
own
will
,
or
subject
only
to
the
tempestuous
wind
,
*NL*
with
hardly
any
attempts
at
regulation
by
human
law
.
The
*NL*
buccaneer
on
the
wave
might
relinquish
his
calling
and
become
at
*NL*
once
if
he
chose
,
a
man
of
probity
and
piety
on
land
;
nor
,
even
*NL*
in
the
full
career
of
his
reckless
life
,
was
he
regarded
as
a
*NL*
personage
with
whom
it
was
disreputable
to
traffic
or
casually
*NL*
associate
.
Thus
the
Puritan
elders
in
their
black
cloaks
,
*NL*
starched
bands
,
and
steeple-crowned
hats
,
smiled
not
*NL*
unbenignantly
at
the
clamour
and
rude
deportment
of
these
jolly
*NL*
seafaring
men
;
and
it
excited
neither
surprise
nor
animadversion
*NL*
when
so
reputable
a
citizen
as
old
Roger
Chillingworth
,
the
*NL*
physician
,
was
seen
to
enter
the
market-place
in
close
and
*NL*
familiar
talk
with
the
commander
of
the
questionable
vessel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
was
by
far
the
most
showy
and
gallant
figure
,
so
far
*NL*
as
apparel
went
,
anywhere
to
be
seen
among
the
multitude
.
He
*NL*
wore
a
profusion
of
ribbons
on
his
garment
,
and
gold
lace
on
his
*NL*
hat
,
which
was
also
encircled
by
a
gold
chain
,
and
surmounted
*NL*
with
a
feather
.
There
was
a
sword
at
his
side
and
a
sword-cut
on
*NL*
his
forehead
,
which
,
by
the
arrangement
of
his
hair
,
he
seemed
*NL*
anxious
rather
to
display
than
hide
.
A
landsman
could
hardly
*NL*
have
worn
this
garb
and
shown
this
face
,
and
worn
and
shown
them
*NL*
both
with
such
a
galliard
air
,
without
undergoing
stern
question
*NL*
before
a
magistrate
,
and
probably
incurring
a
fine
or
*NL*
imprisonment
,
or
perhaps
an
exhibition
in
the
stocks
.
As
*NL*
regarded
the
shipmaster
,
however
,
all
was
looked
upon
as
*NL*
pertaining
to
the
character
,
as
to
a
fish
his
glistening
scales
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
parting
from
the
physician
,
the
commander
of
the
Bristol
*NL*
ship
strolled
idly
through
the
market-place
;
until
happening
to
*NL*
approach
the
spot
where
Hester
Prynne
was
standing
,
he
appeared
*NL*
to
recognise
,
and
did
not
hesitate
to
address
her
.
As
was
*NL*
usually
the
case
wherever
Hester
stood
,
a
small
vacant
area
--
a
*NL*
sort
of
magic
circle
--
had
formed
itself
about
her
,
into
which
,
*NL*
though
the
people
were
elbowing
one
another
at
a
little
*NL*
distance
,
none
ventured
or
felt
disposed
to
intrude
.
It
was
a
*NL*
forcible
type
of
the
moral
solitude
in
which
the
scarlet
letter
*NL*
enveloped
its
fated
wearer
;
partly
by
her
own
reserve
,
and
*NL*
partly
by
the
instinctive
,
though
no
longer
so
unkindly
,
*NL*
withdrawal
of
her
fellow-creatures
.
Now
,
if
never
before
,
it
*NL*
answered
a
good
purpose
by
enabling
Hester
and
the
seaman
to
*NL*
speak
together
without
risk
of
being
overheard
;
and
so
changed
*NL*
was
Hester
Prynne
's
repute
before
the
public
,
that
the
matron
in
*NL*
town
,
most
eminent
for
rigid
morality
,
could
not
have
held
such
*NL*
intercourse
with
less
result
of
scandal
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
mistress
,
''
said
the
mariner
,
``
I
must
bid
the
steward
make
*NL*
ready
one
more
berth
than
you
bargained
for
!
No
fear
of
scurvy
*NL*
or
ship
fever
this
voyage
.
What
with
the
ship
's
surgeon
and
this
*NL*
other
doctor
,
our
only
danger
will
be
from
drug
or
pill
;
more
by
*NL*
token
,
as
there
is
a
lot
of
apothecary
's
stuff
aboard
,
which
I
*NL*
traded
for
with
a
Spanish
vessel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
mean
you
?
''
inquired
Hester
,
startled
more
than
she
*NL*
permitted
to
appear
.
``
Have
you
another
passenger
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
know
you
not
,
''
cried
the
shipmaster
,
``
that
this
physician
*NL*
here
--
Chillingworth
he
calls
himself
--
is
minded
to
try
my
*NL*
cabin-fare
with
you
?
Ay
,
ay
,
you
must
have
known
it
;
for
he
*NL*
tells
me
he
is
of
your
party
,
and
a
close
friend
to
the
*NL*
gentleman
you
spoke
of
--
he
that
is
in
peril
from
these
sour
old
*NL*
Puritan
rulers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
know
each
other
well
,
indeed
,
''
replied
Hester
,
with
a
mien
*NL*
of
calmness
,
though
in
the
utmost
consternation
.
``
They
have
long
*NL*
dwelt
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
further
passed
between
the
mariner
and
Hester
Prynne
.
*NL*
But
at
that
instant
she
beheld
old
Roger
Chillingworth
himself
,
*NL*
standing
in
the
remotest
corner
of
the
market-place
and
smiling
*NL*
on
her
;
a
smile
which
--
across
the
wide
and
bustling
square
,
and
*NL*
through
all
the
talk
and
laughter
,
and
various
thoughts
,
moods
,
*NL*
and
interests
of
the
crowd
--
conveyed
secret
and
fearful
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXII
.
THE
PROCESSION
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Hester
Prynne
could
call
together
her
thoughts
,
and
*NL*
consider
what
was
practicable
to
be
done
in
this
new
and
*NL*
startling
aspect
of
affairs
,
the
sound
of
military
music
was
*NL*
heard
approaching
along
a
contiguous
street
.
It
denoted
the
*NL*
advance
of
the
procession
of
magistrates
and
citizens
on
its
way
*NL*
towards
the
meeting-house
:
where
,
in
compliance
with
a
custom
*NL*
thus
early
established
,
and
ever
since
observed
,
the
Reverend
*NL*
Mr.
Dimmesdale
was
to
deliver
an
Election
Sermon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
the
head
of
the
procession
showed
itself
,
with
a
slow
and
*NL*
stately
march
,
turning
a
corner
,
and
making
its
way
across
the
*NL*
market-place
.
First
came
the
music
.
It
comprised
a
variety
of
*NL*
instruments
,
perhaps
imperfectly
adapted
to
one
another
,
and
*NL*
played
with
no
great
skill
;
but
yet
attaining
the
great
object
*NL*
for
which
the
harmony
of
drum
and
clarion
addresses
itself
to
*NL*
the
multitude
--
that
of
imparting
a
higher
and
more
heroic
air
to
*NL*
the
scene
of
life
that
passes
before
the
eye
.
Little
Pearl
at
*NL*
first
clapped
her
hands
,
but
then
lost
for
an
instant
the
*NL*
restless
agitation
that
had
kept
her
in
a
continual
*NL*
effervescence
throughout
the
morning
;
she
gazed
silently
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
be
borne
upward
like
a
floating
sea-bird
on
the
long
*NL*
heaves
and
swells
of
sound
.
But
she
was
brought
back
to
her
*NL*
former
mood
by
the
shimmer
of
the
sunshine
on
the
weapons
and
*NL*
bright
armour
of
the
military
company
,
which
followed
after
the
*NL*
music
,
and
formed
the
honorary
escort
of
the
procession
.
This
*NL*
body
of
soldiery
--
which
still
sustains
a
corporate
existence
,
*NL*
and
marches
down
from
past
ages
with
an
ancient
and
honourable
*NL*
fame
--
was
composed
of
no
mercenary
materials
.
Its
ranks
were
*NL*
filled
with
gentlemen
who
felt
the
stirrings
of
martial
impulse
,
*NL*
and
sought
to
establish
a
kind
of
College
of
Arms
,
where
,
as
in
*NL*
an
association
of
Knights
Templars
,
they
might
learn
the
*NL*
science
,
and
,
so
far
as
peaceful
exercise
would
teach
them
,
the
*NL*
practices
of
war
.
The
high
estimation
then
placed
upon
the
*NL*
military
character
might
be
seen
in
the
lofty
port
of
each
*NL*
individual
member
of
the
company
.
Some
of
them
,
indeed
,
by
their
*NL*
services
in
the
Low
Countries
and
on
other
fields
of
European
*NL*
warfare
,
had
fairly
won
their
title
to
assume
the
name
and
pomp
*NL*
of
soldiership
.
The
entire
array
,
moreover
,
clad
in
burnished
*NL*
steel
,
and
with
plumage
nodding
over
their
bright
morions
,
had
a
*NL*
brilliancy
of
effect
which
no
modern
display
can
aspire
to
*NL*
equal
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
the
men
of
civil
eminence
,
who
came
immediately
behind
*NL*
the
military
escort
,
were
better
worth
a
thoughtful
observer
's
*NL*
eye
.
Even
in
outward
demeanour
they
showed
a
stamp
of
majesty
*NL*
that
made
the
warrior
's
haughty
stride
look
vulgar
,
if
not
*NL*
absurd
.
It
was
an
age
when
what
we
call
talent
had
far
less
*NL*
consideration
than
now
,
but
the
massive
materials
which
produce
*NL*
stability
and
dignity
of
character
a
great
deal
more
.
The
people
*NL*
possessed
by
hereditary
right
the
quality
of
reverence
,
which
,
*NL*
in
their
descendants
,
if
it
survive
at
all
,
exists
in
smaller
*NL*
proportion
,
and
with
a
vastly
diminished
force
in
the
selection
*NL*
and
estimate
of
public
men
.
The
change
may
be
for
good
or
ill
,
*NL*
and
is
partly
,
perhaps
,
for
both
.
In
that
old
day
the
English
*NL*
settler
on
these
rude
shores
--
having
left
king
,
nobles
,
and
all
*NL*
degrees
of
awful
rank
behind
,
while
still
the
faculty
and
*NL*
necessity
of
reverence
was
strong
in
him
--
bestowed
it
on
the
*NL*
white
hair
and
venerable
brow
of
age
--
on
long-tried
*NL*
integrity
--
on
solid
wisdom
and
sad-coloured
experience
--
on
*NL*
endowments
of
that
grave
and
weighty
order
which
gave
the
idea
*NL*
of
permanence
,
and
comes
under
the
general
definition
of
*NL*
respectability
.
These
primitive
statesmen
,
*NL*
therefore
--
Bradstreet
,
Endicott
,
Dudley
,
Bellingham
,
and
their
*NL*
compeers
--
who
were
elevated
to
power
by
the
early
choice
of
the
*NL*
people
,
seem
to
have
been
not
often
brilliant
,
but
distinguished
*NL*
by
a
ponderous
sobriety
,
rather
than
activity
of
intellect
.
They
*NL*
had
fortitude
and
self-reliance
,
and
in
time
of
difficulty
or
*NL*
peril
stood
up
for
the
welfare
of
the
state
like
a
line
of
*NL*
cliffs
against
a
tempestuous
tide
.
The
traits
of
character
here
*NL*
indicated
were
well
represented
in
the
square
cast
of
*NL*
countenance
and
large
physical
development
of
the
new
colonial
*NL*
magistrates
.
So
far
as
a
demeanour
of
natural
authority
was
*NL*
concerned
,
the
mother
country
need
not
have
been
ashamed
to
see
*NL*
these
foremost
men
of
an
actual
democracy
adopted
into
the
House
*NL*
of
Peers
,
or
make
the
Privy
Council
of
the
Sovereign
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
in
order
to
the
magistrates
came
the
young
and
eminently
*NL*
distinguished
divine
,
from
whose
lips
the
religious
discourse
of
*NL*
the
anniversary
was
expected
.
His
was
the
profession
at
that
era
*NL*
in
which
intellectual
ability
displayed
itself
far
more
than
in
*NL*
political
life
;
for
--
leaving
a
higher
motive
out
of
the
question
*NL*
it
offered
inducements
powerful
enough
in
the
almost
worshipping
*NL*
respect
of
the
community
,
to
win
the
most
aspiring
ambition
into
*NL*
its
service
.
Even
political
power
--
as
in
the
case
of
Increase
*NL*
Mather
--
was
within
the
grasp
of
a
successful
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
observation
of
those
who
beheld
him
now
,
that
never
,
*NL*
since
Mr.
Dimmesdale
first
set
his
foot
on
the
New
England
*NL*
shore
,
had
he
exhibited
such
energy
as
was
seen
in
the
gait
and
*NL*
air
with
which
he
kept
his
pace
in
the
procession
.
There
was
no
*NL*
feebleness
of
step
as
at
other
times
;
his
frame
was
not
bent
,
*NL*
nor
did
his
hand
rest
ominously
upon
his
heart
.
Yet
,
if
the
*NL*
clergyman
were
rightly
viewed
,
his
strength
seemed
not
of
the
*NL*
body
.
It
might
be
spiritual
and
imparted
to
him
by
angelical
*NL*
ministrations
.
It
might
be
the
exhilaration
of
that
potent
*NL*
cordial
which
is
distilled
only
in
the
furnace-glow
of
earnest
*NL*
and
long-continued
thought
.
Or
perchance
his
sensitive
*NL*
temperament
was
invigorated
by
the
loud
and
piercing
music
that
*NL*
swelled
heaven-ward
,
and
uplifted
him
on
its
ascending
wave
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
so
abstracted
was
his
look
,
it
might
be
questioned
*NL*
whether
Mr.
Dimmesdale
even
heard
the
music
.
There
was
his
body
,
*NL*
moving
onward
,
and
with
an
unaccustomed
force
.
But
where
was
his
*NL*
mind
?
Far
and
deep
in
its
own
region
,
busying
itself
,
with
*NL*
preternatural
activity
,
to
marshal
a
procession
of
stately
*NL*
thoughts
that
were
soon
to
issue
thence
;
and
so
he
saw
nothing
,
*NL*
heard
nothing
,
knew
nothing
of
what
was
around
him
;
but
the
*NL*
spiritual
element
took
up
the
feeble
frame
and
carried
it
along
,
*NL*
unconscious
of
the
burden
,
and
converting
it
to
spirit
like
*NL*
itself
.
Men
of
uncommon
intellect
,
who
have
grown
morbid
,
*NL*
possess
this
occasional
power
of
mighty
effort
,
into
which
they
*NL*
throw
the
life
of
many
days
and
then
are
lifeless
for
as
many
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
,
gazing
steadfastly
at
the
clergyman
,
felt
a
*NL*
dreary
influence
come
over
her
,
but
wherefore
or
whence
she
knew
*NL*
not
,
unless
that
he
seemed
so
remote
from
her
own
sphere
,
and
*NL*
utterly
beyond
her
reach
.
One
glance
of
recognition
she
had
*NL*
imagined
must
needs
pass
between
them
.
She
thought
of
the
dim
*NL*
forest
,
with
its
little
dell
of
solitude
,
and
love
,
and
anguish
,
*NL*
and
the
mossy
tree-trunk
,
where
,
sitting
hand-in-hand
,
they
had
*NL*
mingled
their
sad
and
passionate
talk
with
the
melancholy
murmur
*NL*
of
the
brook
.
How
deeply
had
they
known
each
other
then
!
And
was
*NL*
this
the
man
?
She
hardly
knew
him
now
!
He
,
moving
proudly
past
,
*NL*
enveloped
as
it
were
,
in
the
rich
music
,
with
the
procession
of
*NL*
majestic
and
venerable
fathers
;
he
,
so
unattainable
in
his
*NL*
worldly
position
,
and
still
more
so
in
that
far
vista
of
his
*NL*
unsympathizing
thoughts
,
through
which
she
now
beheld
him
!
Her
*NL*
spirit
sank
with
the
idea
that
all
must
have
been
a
delusion
,
*NL*
and
that
,
vividly
as
she
had
dreamed
it
,
there
could
be
no
real
*NL*
bond
betwixt
the
clergyman
and
herself
.
And
thus
much
of
woman
*NL*
was
there
in
Hester
,
that
she
could
scarcely
forgive
him
--
least
*NL*
of
all
now
,
when
the
heavy
footstep
of
their
approaching
Fate
*NL*
might
be
heard
,
nearer
,
nearer
,
nearer
!
--
for
being
able
so
*NL*
completely
to
withdraw
himself
from
their
mutual
world
--
while
*NL*
she
groped
darkly
,
and
stretched
forth
her
cold
hands
,
and
found
*NL*
him
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
either
saw
and
responded
to
her
mother
's
feelings
,
or
*NL*
herself
felt
the
remoteness
and
intangibility
that
had
fallen
*NL*
around
the
minister
.
While
the
procession
passed
,
the
child
was
*NL*
uneasy
,
fluttering
up
and
down
,
like
a
bird
on
the
point
of
*NL*
taking
flight
.
When
the
whole
had
gone
by
,
she
looked
up
into
*NL*
Hester
's
face
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
said
she
,
``
was
that
the
same
minister
that
kissed
me
*NL*
by
the
brook
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
thy
peace
,
dear
little
Pearl
!
''
whispered
her
mother
.
``
We
*NL*
must
not
always
talk
in
the
marketplace
of
what
happens
to
us
in
*NL*
the
forest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
be
sure
that
it
was
he
--
so
strange
he
looked
,
''
*NL*
continued
the
child
.
``
Else
I
would
have
run
to
him
,
and
bid
him
*NL*
kiss
me
now
,
before
all
the
people
,
even
as
he
did
yonder
among
*NL*
the
dark
old
trees
.
What
would
the
minister
have
said
,
mother
?
*NL*
Would
he
have
clapped
his
hand
over
his
heart
,
and
scowled
on
*NL*
me
,
and
bid
me
begone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
he
say
,
Pearl
,
''
answered
Hester
,
``
save
that
it
was
*NL*
no
time
to
kiss
,
and
that
kisses
are
not
to
be
given
in
the
*NL*
market-place
?
Well
for
thee
,
foolish
child
,
that
thou
didst
not
*NL*
speak
to
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
shade
of
the
same
sentiment
,
in
reference
to
Mr.
*NL*
Dimmesdale
,
was
expressed
by
a
person
whose
*NL*
eccentricities
--
insanity
,
as
we
should
term
it
--
led
her
to
do
*NL*
what
few
of
the
townspeople
would
have
ventured
on
--
to
begin
a
*NL*
conversation
with
the
wearer
of
the
scarlet
letter
in
public
.
It
*NL*
was
Mistress
Hibbins
,
who
,
arrayed
in
great
magnificence
,
with
a
*NL*
triple
ruff
,
a
broidered
stomacher
,
a
gown
of
rich
velvet
,
and
a
*NL*
gold-headed
cane
,
had
come
forth
to
see
the
procession
.
As
this
*NL*
ancient
lady
had
the
renown
-LRB-
which
subsequently
cost
her
no
less
*NL*
a
price
than
her
life
-RRB-
of
being
a
principal
actor
in
all
the
*NL*
works
of
necromancy
that
were
continually
going
forward
,
the
*NL*
crowd
gave
way
before
her
,
and
seemed
to
fear
the
touch
of
her
*NL*
garment
,
as
if
it
carried
the
plague
among
its
gorgeous
folds
.
*NL*
Seen
in
conjunction
with
Hester
Prynne
--
kindly
as
so
many
now
*NL*
felt
towards
the
latter
--
the
dread
inspired
by
Mistress
Hibbins
*NL*
had
doubled
,
and
caused
a
general
movement
from
that
part
of
the
*NL*
market-place
in
which
the
two
women
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
what
mortal
imagination
could
conceive
it
?
''
whispered
the
*NL*
old
lady
confidentially
to
Hester
.
``
Yonder
divine
man
!
That
*NL*
saint
on
earth
,
as
the
people
uphold
him
to
be
,
and
as
--
I
must
*NL*
needs
say
--
he
really
looks
!
Who
,
now
,
that
saw
him
pass
in
the
*NL*
procession
,
would
think
how
little
while
it
is
since
he
went
*NL*
forth
out
of
his
study
--
chewing
a
Hebrew
text
of
Scripture
in
*NL*
his
mouth
,
I
warrant
--
to
take
an
airing
in
the
forest
!
Aha
!
we
*NL*
know
what
that
means
,
Hester
Prynne
!
But
truly
,
forsooth
,
I
find
*NL*
it
hard
to
believe
him
the
same
man
.
Many
a
church
member
saw
I
,
*NL*
walking
behind
the
music
,
that
has
danced
in
the
same
measure
*NL*
with
me
,
when
Somebody
was
fiddler
,
and
,
it
might
be
,
an
Indian
*NL*
powwow
or
a
Lapland
wizard
changing
hands
with
us
!
That
is
but
a
*NL*
trifle
,
when
a
woman
knows
the
world
.
But
this
minister
.
Couldst
*NL*
thou
surely
tell
,
Hester
,
whether
he
was
the
same
man
that
*NL*
encountered
thee
on
the
forest
path
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
I
know
not
of
what
you
speak
,
''
answered
Hester
Prynne
,
*NL*
feeling
Mistress
Hibbins
to
be
of
infirm
mind
;
yet
strangely
*NL*
startled
and
awe-stricken
by
the
confidence
with
which
she
*NL*
affirmed
a
personal
connexion
between
so
many
persons
-LRB-
herself
*NL*
among
them
-RRB-
and
the
Evil
One
.
``
It
is
not
for
me
to
talk
lightly
*NL*
of
a
learned
and
pious
minister
of
the
Word
,
like
the
Reverend
*NL*
Mr.
Dimmesdale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fie
,
woman
--
fie
!
''
cried
the
old
lady
,
shaking
her
finger
at
*NL*
Hester
.
``
Dost
thou
think
I
have
been
to
the
forest
so
many
*NL*
times
,
and
have
yet
no
skill
to
judge
who
else
has
been
there
?
*NL*
Yea
,
though
no
leaf
of
the
wild
garlands
which
they
wore
while
*NL*
they
danced
be
left
in
their
hair
!
I
know
thee
,
Hester
,
for
I
*NL*
behold
the
token
.
We
may
all
see
it
in
the
sunshine
!
and
it
*NL*
glows
like
a
red
flame
in
the
dark
.
Thou
wearest
it
openly
,
so
*NL*
there
need
be
no
question
about
that
.
But
this
minister
!
Let
me
*NL*
tell
thee
in
thine
ear
!
When
the
Black
Man
sees
one
of
his
own
*NL*
servants
,
signed
and
sealed
,
so
shy
of
owning
to
the
bond
as
is
*NL*
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
he
hath
a
way
of
ordering
matters
*NL*
so
that
the
mark
shall
be
disclosed
,
in
open
daylight
,
to
the
*NL*
eyes
of
all
the
world
!
What
is
that
the
minister
seeks
to
hide
,
*NL*
with
his
hand
always
over
his
heart
?
Ha
,
Hester
Prynne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
good
Mistress
Hibbins
?
''
eagerly
asked
little
Pearl
.
*NL*
``
Hast
thou
seen
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
,
darling
!
''
responded
Mistress
Hibbins
,
making
Pearl
a
*NL*
profound
reverence
.
``
Thou
thyself
wilt
see
it
,
one
time
or
*NL*
another
.
They
say
,
child
,
thou
art
of
the
lineage
of
the
Prince
*NL*
of
Air
!
Wilt
thou
ride
with
me
some
fine
night
to
see
thy
*NL*
father
?
Then
thou
shalt
know
wherefore
the
minister
keeps
his
*NL*
hand
over
his
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laughing
so
shrilly
that
all
the
market-place
could
hear
her
,
*NL*
the
weird
old
gentlewoman
took
her
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
preliminary
prayer
had
been
offered
in
the
*NL*
meeting-house
,
and
the
accents
of
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
*NL*
were
heard
commencing
his
discourse
.
An
irresistible
feeling
*NL*
kept
Hester
near
the
spot
.
As
the
sacred
edifice
was
too
much
*NL*
thronged
to
admit
another
auditor
,
she
took
up
her
position
*NL*
close
beside
the
scaffold
of
the
pillory
.
It
was
in
sufficient
*NL*
proximity
to
bring
the
whole
sermon
to
her
ears
,
in
the
shape
of
*NL*
an
indistinct
but
varied
murmur
and
flow
of
the
minister
's
very
*NL*
peculiar
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
vocal
organ
was
in
itself
a
rich
endowment
,
insomuch
that
a
*NL*
listener
,
comprehending
nothing
of
the
language
in
which
the
*NL*
preacher
spoke
,
might
still
have
been
swayed
to
and
fro
by
the
*NL*
mere
tone
and
cadence
.
Like
all
other
music
,
it
breathed
passion
*NL*
and
pathos
,
and
emotions
high
or
tender
,
in
a
tongue
native
to
*NL*
the
human
heart
,
wherever
educated
.
Muffled
as
the
sound
was
by
*NL*
its
passage
through
the
church
walls
,
Hester
Prynne
listened
*NL*
with
such
intenseness
,
and
sympathized
so
intimately
,
that
the
*NL*
sermon
had
throughout
a
meaning
for
her
,
entirely
apart
from
its
*NL*
indistinguishable
words
.
These
,
perhaps
,
if
more
distinctly
*NL*
heard
,
might
have
been
only
a
grosser
medium
,
and
have
clogged
*NL*
the
spiritual
sense
.
Now
she
caught
the
low
undertone
,
as
of
the
*NL*
wind
sinking
down
to
repose
itself
;
then
ascended
with
it
,
as
it
*NL*
rose
through
progressive
gradations
of
sweetness
and
power
,
*NL*
until
its
volume
seemed
to
envelop
her
with
an
atmosphere
of
awe
*NL*
and
solemn
grandeur
.
And
yet
,
majestic
as
the
voice
sometimes
*NL*
became
,
there
was
for
ever
in
it
an
essential
character
of
*NL*
plaintiveness
.
A
loud
or
low
expression
of
anguish
--
the
whisper
,
*NL*
or
the
shriek
,
as
it
might
be
conceived
,
of
suffering
humanity
,
*NL*
that
touched
a
sensibility
in
every
bosom
!
At
times
this
deep
*NL*
strain
of
pathos
was
all
that
could
be
heard
,
and
scarcely
heard
*NL*
sighing
amid
a
desolate
silence
.
But
even
when
the
minister
's
*NL*
voice
grew
high
and
commanding
--
when
it
gushed
irrepressibly
*NL*
upward
--
when
it
assumed
its
utmost
breadth
and
power
,
so
*NL*
overfilling
the
church
as
to
burst
its
way
through
the
solid
*NL*
walls
,
and
diffuse
itself
in
the
open
air
--
still
,
if
the
auditor
*NL*
listened
intently
,
and
for
the
purpose
,
he
could
detect
the
same
*NL*
cry
of
pain
.
What
was
it
?
The
complaint
of
a
human
heart
,
*NL*
sorrow-laden
,
perchance
guilty
,
telling
its
secret
,
whether
of
*NL*
guilt
or
sorrow
,
to
the
great
heart
of
mankind
;
beseeching
its
*NL*
sympathy
or
forgiveness
,
--
at
every
moment
,
--
in
each
accent
,
--
and
*NL*
never
in
vain
!
It
was
this
profound
and
continual
undertone
that
*NL*
gave
the
clergyman
his
most
appropriate
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
all
this
time
,
Hester
stood
,
statue-like
,
at
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
scaffold
.
If
the
minister
's
voice
had
not
kept
her
there
,
*NL*
there
would
,
nevertheless
,
have
been
an
inevitable
magnetism
in
*NL*
that
spot
,
whence
she
dated
the
first
hour
of
her
life
of
*NL*
ignominy
.
There
was
a
sense
within
her
--
too
ill-defined
to
be
*NL*
made
a
thought
,
but
weighing
heavily
on
her
mind
--
that
her
whole
*NL*
orb
of
life
,
both
before
and
after
,
was
connected
with
this
*NL*
spot
,
as
with
the
one
point
that
gave
it
unity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Pearl
,
meanwhile
,
had
quitted
her
mother
's
side
,
and
was
*NL*
playing
at
her
own
will
about
the
market-place
.
She
made
the
*NL*
sombre
crowd
cheerful
by
her
erratic
and
glistening
ray
,
even
as
*NL*
a
bird
of
bright
plumage
illuminates
a
whole
tree
of
dusky
*NL*
foliage
by
darting
to
and
fro
,
half
seen
and
half
concealed
amid
*NL*
the
twilight
of
the
clustering
leaves
.
She
had
an
undulating
,
*NL*
but
oftentimes
a
sharp
and
irregular
movement
.
It
indicated
the
*NL*
restless
vivacity
of
her
spirit
,
which
to-day
was
doubly
*NL*
indefatigable
in
its
tip-toe
dance
,
because
it
was
played
upon
*NL*
and
vibrated
with
her
mother
's
disquietude
.
Whenever
Pearl
saw
*NL*
anything
to
excite
her
ever
active
and
wandering
curiosity
,
she
*NL*
flew
thitherward
,
and
,
as
we
might
say
,
seized
upon
that
man
or
*NL*
thing
as
her
own
property
,
so
far
as
she
desired
it
,
but
without
*NL*
yielding
the
minutest
degree
of
control
over
her
motions
in
*NL*
requital
.
The
Puritans
looked
on
,
and
,
if
they
smiled
,
were
none
*NL*
the
less
inclined
to
pronounce
the
child
a
demon
offspring
,
from
*NL*
the
indescribable
charm
of
beauty
and
eccentricity
that
shone
*NL*
through
her
little
figure
,
and
sparkled
with
its
activity
.
She
*NL*
ran
and
looked
the
wild
Indian
in
the
face
,
and
he
grew
*NL*
conscious
of
a
nature
wilder
than
his
own
.
Thence
,
with
native
*NL*
audacity
,
but
still
with
a
reserve
as
characteristic
,
she
flew
*NL*
into
the
midst
of
a
group
of
mariners
,
the
swarthy-cheeked
wild
*NL*
men
of
the
ocean
,
as
the
Indians
were
of
the
land
;
and
they
*NL*
gazed
wonderingly
and
admiringly
at
Pearl
,
as
if
a
flake
of
the
*NL*
sea-foam
had
taken
the
shape
of
a
little
maid
,
and
were
gifted
*NL*
with
a
soul
of
the
sea-fire
,
that
flashes
beneath
the
prow
in
*NL*
the
night-time
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
seafaring
men
the
shipmaster
,
indeed
,
who
had
*NL*
spoken
to
Hester
Prynne
was
so
smitten
with
Pearl
's
aspect
,
that
*NL*
he
attempted
to
lay
hands
upon
her
,
with
purpose
to
snatch
a
*NL*
kiss
.
Finding
it
as
impossible
to
touch
her
as
to
catch
a
*NL*
humming-bird
in
the
air
,
he
took
from
his
hat
the
gold
chain
*NL*
that
was
twisted
about
it
,
and
threw
it
to
the
child
.
Pearl
*NL*
immediately
twined
it
around
her
neck
and
waist
with
such
happy
*NL*
skill
,
that
,
once
seen
there
,
it
became
a
part
of
her
,
and
it
*NL*
was
difficult
to
imagine
her
without
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy
mother
is
yonder
woman
with
the
scarlet
letter
,
''
said
the
*NL*
seaman
,
``
Wilt
thou
carry
her
a
message
from
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
message
pleases
me
,
I
will
,
''
answered
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
tell
her
,
''
rejoined
he
,
``
that
I
spake
again
with
the
*NL*
black-a-visaged
,
hump
shouldered
old
doctor
,
and
he
engages
to
*NL*
bring
his
friend
,
the
gentleman
she
wots
of
,
aboard
with
him
.
So
*NL*
let
thy
mother
take
no
thought
,
save
for
herself
and
thee
.
Wilt
*NL*
thou
tell
her
this
,
thou
witch-baby
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mistress
Hibbins
says
my
father
is
the
Prince
of
the
Air
!
''
*NL*
cried
Pearl
,
with
a
naughty
smile
.
``
If
thou
callest
me
that
*NL*
ill-name
,
I
shall
tell
him
of
thee
,
and
he
will
chase
thy
ship
*NL*
with
a
tempest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pursuing
a
zigzag
course
across
the
marketplace
,
the
child
*NL*
returned
to
her
mother
,
and
communicated
what
the
mariner
had
*NL*
said
.
Hester
's
strong
,
calm
steadfastly-enduring
spirit
almost
*NL*
sank
,
at
last
,
on
beholding
this
dark
and
grim
countenance
of
an
*NL*
inevitable
doom
,
which
at
the
moment
when
a
passage
seemed
to
*NL*
open
for
the
minister
and
herself
out
of
their
labyrinth
of
*NL*
misery
--
showed
itself
with
an
unrelenting
smile
,
right
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
their
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
mind
harassed
by
the
terrible
perplexity
in
which
the
*NL*
shipmaster
's
intelligence
involved
her
,
she
was
also
subjected
*NL*
to
another
trial
.
There
were
many
people
present
from
the
*NL*
country
round
about
,
who
had
often
heard
of
the
scarlet
letter
,
*NL*
and
to
whom
it
had
been
made
terrific
by
a
hundred
false
or
*NL*
exaggerated
rumours
,
but
who
had
never
beheld
it
with
their
own
*NL*
bodily
eyes
.
These
,
after
exhausting
other
modes
of
amusement
,
*NL*
now
thronged
about
Hester
Prynne
with
rude
and
boorish
*NL*
intrusiveness
.
Unscrupulous
as
it
was
,
however
,
it
could
not
*NL*
bring
them
nearer
than
a
circuit
of
several
yards
.
At
that
*NL*
distance
they
accordingly
stood
,
fixed
there
by
the
centrifugal
*NL*
force
of
the
repugnance
which
the
mystic
symbol
inspired
.
The
*NL*
whole
gang
of
sailors
,
likewise
,
observing
the
press
of
*NL*
spectators
,
and
learning
the
purport
of
the
scarlet
letter
,
came
*NL*
and
thrust
their
sunburnt
and
desperado-looking
faces
into
the
*NL*
ring
.
Even
the
Indians
were
affected
by
a
sort
of
cold
shadow
of
*NL*
the
white
man
's
curiosity
and
,
gliding
through
the
crowd
,
*NL*
fastened
their
snake-like
black
eyes
on
Hester
's
bosom
,
*NL*
conceiving
,
perhaps
,
that
the
wearer
of
this
brilliantly
*NL*
embroidered
badge
must
needs
be
a
personage
of
high
dignity
*NL*
among
her
people
.
Lastly
,
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
-LRB-
their
own
*NL*
interest
in
this
worn-out
subject
languidly
reviving
itself
,
by
*NL*
sympathy
with
what
they
saw
others
feel
-RRB-
lounged
idly
to
the
*NL*
same
quarter
,
and
tormented
Hester
Prynne
,
perhaps
more
than
all
*NL*
the
rest
,
with
their
cool
,
well-acquainted
gaze
at
her
familiar
*NL*
shame
.
Hester
saw
and
recognized
the
selfsame
faces
of
that
*NL*
group
of
matrons
,
who
had
awaited
her
forthcoming
from
the
*NL*
prison-door
seven
years
ago
;
all
save
one
,
the
youngest
and
only
*NL*
compassionate
among
them
,
whose
burial-robe
she
had
since
made
.
*NL*
At
the
final
hour
,
when
she
was
so
soon
to
fling
aside
the
*NL*
burning
letter
,
it
had
strangely
become
the
centre
of
more
*NL*
remark
and
excitement
,
and
was
thus
made
to
sear
her
breast
more
*NL*
painfully
,
than
at
any
time
since
the
first
day
she
put
it
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Hester
stood
in
that
magic
circle
of
ignominy
,
where
the
*NL*
cunning
cruelty
of
her
sentence
seemed
to
have
fixed
her
for
*NL*
ever
,
the
admirable
preacher
was
looking
down
from
the
sacred
*NL*
pulpit
upon
an
audience
whose
very
inmost
spirits
had
yielded
to
*NL*
his
control
.
The
sainted
minister
in
the
church
!
The
woman
of
*NL*
the
scarlet
letter
in
the
marketplace
!
What
imagination
would
*NL*
have
been
irreverent
enough
to
surmise
that
the
same
scorching
*NL*
stigma
was
on
them
both
!

THE
REVELATION
OF
THE
SCARLET
LETTER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
eloquent
voice
,
on
which
the
souls
of
the
listening
audience
*NL*
had
been
borne
aloft
as
on
the
swelling
waves
of
the
sea
,
at
*NL*
length
came
to
a
pause
.
There
was
a
momentary
silence
,
profound
*NL*
as
what
should
follow
the
utterance
of
oracles
.
Then
ensued
a
*NL*
murmur
and
half-hushed
tumult
,
as
if
the
auditors
,
released
from
*NL*
the
high
spell
that
had
transported
them
into
the
region
of
*NL*
another
's
mind
,
were
returning
into
themselves
,
with
all
their
*NL*
awe
and
wonder
still
heavy
on
them
.
In
a
moment
more
the
crowd
*NL*
began
to
gush
forth
from
the
doors
of
the
church
.
Now
that
there
*NL*
was
an
end
,
they
needed
more
breath
,
more
fit
to
support
the
*NL*
gross
and
earthly
life
into
which
they
relapsed
,
than
that
*NL*
atmosphere
which
the
preacher
had
converted
into
words
of
flame
,
*NL*
and
had
burdened
with
the
rich
fragrance
of
his
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
open
air
their
rapture
broke
into
speech
.
The
street
and
*NL*
the
market-place
absolutely
babbled
,
from
side
to
side
,
with
*NL*
applauses
of
the
minister
.
His
hearers
could
not
rest
until
they
*NL*
had
told
one
another
of
what
each
knew
better
than
he
could
tell
*NL*
or
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
their
united
testimony
,
never
had
man
spoken
in
so
*NL*
wise
,
so
high
,
and
so
holy
a
spirit
,
as
he
that
spake
this
day
;
*NL*
nor
had
inspiration
ever
breathed
through
mortal
lips
more
*NL*
evidently
than
it
did
through
his
.
Its
influence
could
be
seen
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
descending
upon
him
,
and
possessing
him
,
and
*NL*
continually
lifting
him
out
of
the
written
discourse
that
lay
*NL*
before
him
,
and
filling
him
with
ideas
that
must
have
been
as
*NL*
marvellous
to
himself
as
to
his
audience
.
His
subject
,
it
*NL*
appeared
,
had
been
the
relation
between
the
Deity
and
the
*NL*
communities
of
mankind
,
with
a
special
reference
to
the
New
*NL*
England
which
they
were
here
planting
in
the
wilderness
.
And
,
as
*NL*
he
drew
towards
the
close
,
a
spirit
as
of
prophecy
had
come
upon
*NL*
him
,
constraining
him
to
its
purpose
as
mightily
as
the
old
*NL*
prophets
of
Israel
were
constrained
,
only
with
this
difference
,
*NL*
that
,
whereas
the
Jewish
seers
had
denounced
judgments
and
ruin
*NL*
on
their
country
,
it
was
his
mission
to
foretell
a
high
and
*NL*
glorious
destiny
for
the
newly
gathered
people
of
the
Lord
.
But
,
*NL*
throughout
it
all
,
and
through
the
whole
discourse
,
there
had
*NL*
been
a
certain
deep
,
sad
undertone
of
pathos
,
which
could
not
be
*NL*
interpreted
otherwise
than
as
the
natural
regret
of
one
soon
to
*NL*
pass
away
.
Yes
;
their
minister
whom
they
so
loved
--
and
who
so
*NL*
loved
them
all
,
that
he
could
not
depart
heavenward
without
a
*NL*
sigh
--
had
the
foreboding
of
untimely
death
upon
him
,
and
would
*NL*
soon
leave
them
in
their
tears
.
This
idea
of
his
transitory
stay
*NL*
on
earth
gave
the
last
emphasis
to
the
effect
which
the
preacher
*NL*
had
produced
;
it
was
as
if
an
angel
,
in
his
passage
to
the
skies
,
*NL*
had
shaken
his
bright
wings
over
the
people
for
an
instant
--
at
*NL*
once
a
shadow
and
a
splendour
--
and
had
shed
down
a
shower
of
*NL*
golden
truths
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
there
had
come
to
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
--
as
to
most
*NL*
men
,
in
their
various
spheres
,
though
seldom
recognised
until
*NL*
they
see
it
far
behind
them
--
an
epoch
of
life
more
brilliant
and
*NL*
full
of
triumph
than
any
previous
one
,
or
than
any
which
could
*NL*
hereafter
be
.
He
stood
,
at
this
moment
,
on
the
very
proudest
*NL*
eminence
of
superiority
,
to
which
the
gifts
or
intellect
,
rich
*NL*
lore
,
prevailing
eloquence
,
and
a
reputation
of
whitest
*NL*
sanctity
,
could
exalt
a
clergyman
in
New
England
's
earliest
*NL*
days
,
when
the
professional
character
was
of
itself
a
lofty
*NL*
pedestal
.
Such
was
the
position
which
the
minister
occupied
,
as
*NL*
he
bowed
his
head
forward
on
the
cushions
of
the
pulpit
at
the
*NL*
close
of
his
Election
Sermon
.
Meanwhile
Hester
Prynne
was
*NL*
standing
beside
the
scaffold
of
the
pillory
,
with
the
scarlet
*NL*
letter
still
burning
on
her
breast
!
*NL*
*NL*
Now
was
heard
again
the
clamour
of
the
music
,
and
the
measured
*NL*
tramp
of
the
military
escort
issuing
from
the
church
door
.
The
*NL*
procession
was
to
be
marshalled
thence
to
the
town
hall
,
where
a
*NL*
solemn
banquet
would
complete
the
ceremonies
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
,
therefore
,
the
train
of
venerable
and
majestic
*NL*
fathers
were
seen
moving
through
a
broad
pathway
of
the
people
,
*NL*
who
drew
back
reverently
,
on
either
side
,
as
the
Governor
and
*NL*
magistrates
,
the
old
and
wise
men
,
the
holy
ministers
,
and
all
*NL*
that
were
eminent
and
renowned
,
advanced
into
the
midst
of
them
.
*NL*
When
they
were
fairly
in
the
marketplace
,
their
presence
was
*NL*
greeted
by
a
shout
.
This
--
though
doubtless
it
might
acquire
*NL*
additional
force
and
volume
from
the
child-like
loyalty
which
*NL*
the
age
awarded
to
its
rulers
--
was
felt
to
be
an
irrepressible
*NL*
outburst
of
enthusiasm
kindled
in
the
auditors
by
that
high
*NL*
strain
of
eloquence
which
was
yet
reverberating
in
their
ears
.
*NL*
Each
felt
the
impulse
in
himself
,
and
in
the
same
breath
,
caught
*NL*
it
from
his
neighbour
.
Within
the
church
,
it
had
hardly
been
*NL*
kept
down
;
beneath
the
sky
it
pealed
upward
to
the
zenith
.
There
*NL*
were
human
beings
enough
,
and
enough
of
highly
wrought
and
*NL*
symphonious
feeling
to
produce
that
more
impressive
sound
than
*NL*
the
organ
tones
of
the
blast
,
or
the
thunder
,
or
the
roar
of
the
*NL*
sea
;
even
that
mighty
swell
of
many
voices
,
blended
into
one
*NL*
great
voice
by
the
universal
impulse
which
makes
likewise
one
*NL*
vast
heart
out
of
the
many
.
Never
,
from
the
soil
of
New
England
*NL*
had
gone
up
such
a
shout
!
Never
,
on
New
England
soil
had
stood
*NL*
the
man
so
honoured
by
his
mortal
brethren
as
the
preacher
!
*NL*
*NL*
How
fared
it
with
him
,
then
?
Were
there
not
the
brilliant
*NL*
particles
of
a
halo
in
the
air
about
his
head
?
So
etherealised
*NL*
by
spirit
as
he
was
,
and
so
apotheosised
by
worshipping
*NL*
admirers
,
did
his
footsteps
,
in
the
procession
,
really
tread
*NL*
upon
the
dust
of
earth
?
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
ranks
of
military
men
and
civil
fathers
moved
onward
,
all
*NL*
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
point
where
the
minister
was
seen
*NL*
to
approach
among
them
.
The
shout
died
into
a
murmur
,
as
one
*NL*
portion
of
the
crowd
after
another
obtained
a
glimpse
of
him
.
*NL*
How
feeble
and
pale
he
looked
,
amid
all
his
triumph
!
The
*NL*
energy
--
or
say
,
rather
,
the
inspiration
which
had
held
him
up
,
*NL*
until
he
should
have
delivered
the
sacred
message
that
had
*NL*
brought
its
own
strength
along
with
it
from
heaven
--
was
*NL*
withdrawn
,
now
that
it
had
so
faithfully
performed
its
office
.
*NL*
The
glow
,
which
they
had
just
before
beheld
burning
on
his
*NL*
cheek
,
was
extinguished
,
like
a
flame
that
sinks
down
hopelessly
*NL*
among
the
late
decaying
embers
.
It
seemed
hardly
the
face
of
a
*NL*
man
alive
,
with
such
a
death-like
hue
:
it
was
hardly
a
man
with
*NL*
life
in
him
,
that
tottered
on
his
path
so
nervously
,
yet
*NL*
tottered
,
and
did
not
fall
!
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
his
clerical
brethren
--
it
was
the
venerable
John
*NL*
Wilson
--
observing
the
state
in
which
Mr.
Dimmesdale
was
left
by
*NL*
the
retiring
wave
of
intellect
and
sensibility
,
stepped
forward
*NL*
hastily
to
offer
his
support
.
The
minister
tremulously
,
but
*NL*
decidedly
,
repelled
the
old
man
's
arm
.
He
still
walked
onward
,
*NL*
if
that
movement
could
be
so
described
,
which
rather
resembled
*NL*
the
wavering
effort
of
an
infant
,
with
its
mother
's
arms
in
*NL*
view
,
outstretched
to
tempt
him
forward
.
And
now
,
almost
*NL*
imperceptible
as
were
the
latter
steps
of
his
progress
,
he
had
*NL*
come
opposite
the
well-remembered
and
weather-darkened
scaffold
,
*NL*
where
,
long
since
,
with
all
that
dreary
lapse
of
time
between
,
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
had
encountered
the
world
's
ignominious
stare
.
*NL*
There
stood
Hester
,
holding
little
Pearl
by
the
hand
!
And
there
*NL*
was
the
scarlet
letter
on
her
breast
!
The
minister
here
made
a
*NL*
pause
;
although
the
music
still
played
the
stately
and
rejoicing
*NL*
march
to
which
the
procession
moved
.
It
summoned
him
*NL*
onward
--
inward
to
the
festival
!
--
but
here
he
made
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bellingham
,
for
the
last
few
moments
,
had
kept
an
anxious
eye
*NL*
upon
him
.
He
now
left
his
own
place
in
the
procession
,
and
*NL*
advanced
to
give
assistance
judging
,
from
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
*NL*
aspect
that
he
must
otherwise
inevitably
fall
.
But
there
was
*NL*
something
in
the
latter
's
expression
that
warned
back
the
*NL*
magistrate
,
although
a
man
not
readily
obeying
the
vague
*NL*
intimations
that
pass
from
one
spirit
to
another
.
The
crowd
,
*NL*
meanwhile
,
looked
on
with
awe
and
wonder
.
This
earthly
*NL*
faintness
,
was
,
in
their
view
,
only
another
phase
of
the
*NL*
minister
's
celestial
strength
;
nor
would
it
have
seemed
a
*NL*
miracle
too
high
to
be
wrought
for
one
so
holy
,
had
he
ascended
*NL*
before
their
eyes
,
waxing
dimmer
and
brighter
,
and
fading
at
*NL*
last
into
the
light
of
heaven
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
towards
the
scaffold
,
and
stretched
forth
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hester
,
''
said
he
,
``
come
hither
!
Come
,
my
little
Pearl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
ghastly
look
with
which
he
regarded
them
;
but
there
was
*NL*
something
at
once
tender
and
strangely
triumphant
in
it
.
The
*NL*
child
,
with
the
bird-like
motion
,
which
was
one
of
her
*NL*
characteristics
,
flew
to
him
,
and
clasped
her
arms
about
his
*NL*
knees
.
Hester
Prynne
--
slowly
,
as
if
impelled
by
inevitable
fate
,
*NL*
and
against
her
strongest
will
--
likewise
drew
near
,
but
paused
*NL*
before
she
reached
him
.
At
this
instant
old
Roger
Chillingworth
*NL*
thrust
himself
through
the
crowd
--
or
,
perhaps
,
so
dark
,
*NL*
disturbed
,
and
evil
was
his
look
,
he
rose
up
out
of
some
nether
*NL*
region
--
to
snatch
back
his
victim
from
what
he
sought
to
do
!
Be
*NL*
that
as
it
might
,
the
old
man
rushed
forward
,
and
caught
the
*NL*
minister
by
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madman
,
hold
!
what
is
your
purpose
?
''
whispered
he
.
``
Wave
back
*NL*
that
woman
!
Cast
off
this
child
!
All
shall
be
well
!
Do
not
*NL*
blacken
your
fame
,
and
perish
in
dishonour
!
I
can
yet
save
you
!
*NL*
Would
you
bring
infamy
on
your
sacred
profession
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
tempter
!
Methinks
thou
art
too
late
!
''
answered
the
*NL*
minister
,
encountering
his
eye
,
fearfully
,
but
firmly
.
``
Thy
*NL*
power
is
not
what
it
was
!
With
God
's
help
,
I
shall
escape
thee
*NL*
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
again
extended
his
hand
to
the
woman
of
the
scarlet
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hester
Prynne
,
''
cried
he
,
with
a
piercing
earnestness
,
``
in
the
*NL*
name
of
Him
,
so
terrible
and
so
merciful
,
who
gives
me
grace
,
at
*NL*
this
last
moment
,
to
do
what
--
for
my
own
heavy
sin
and
miserable
*NL*
agony
--
I
withheld
myself
from
doing
seven
years
ago
,
come
hither
*NL*
now
,
and
twine
thy
strength
about
me
!
Thy
strength
,
Hester
;
but
*NL*
let
it
be
guided
by
the
will
which
God
hath
granted
me
!
This
*NL*
wretched
and
wronged
old
man
is
opposing
it
with
all
his
*NL*
might
!
--
with
all
his
own
might
,
and
the
fiend
's
!
Come
,
*NL*
Hester
--
come
!
Support
me
up
yonder
scaffold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
was
in
a
tumult
.
The
men
of
rank
and
dignity
,
who
*NL*
stood
more
immediately
around
the
clergyman
,
were
so
taken
by
*NL*
surprise
,
and
so
perplexed
as
to
the
purport
of
what
they
*NL*
saw
--
unable
to
receive
the
explanation
which
most
readily
*NL*
presented
itself
,
or
to
imagine
any
other
--
that
they
remained
*NL*
silent
and
inactive
spectators
of
the
judgement
which
Providence
*NL*
seemed
about
to
work
.
They
beheld
the
minister
,
leaning
on
*NL*
Hester
's
shoulder
,
and
supported
by
her
arm
around
him
,
approach
*NL*
the
scaffold
,
and
ascend
its
steps
;
while
still
the
little
hand
*NL*
of
the
sin-born
child
was
clasped
in
his
.
Old
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
followed
,
as
one
intimately
connected
with
the
*NL*
drama
of
guilt
and
sorrow
in
which
they
had
all
been
actors
,
and
*NL*
well
entitled
,
therefore
to
be
present
at
its
closing
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hadst
thou
sought
the
whole
earth
over
,
''
said
he
looking
darkly
*NL*
at
the
clergyman
,
``
there
was
no
one
place
so
secret
--
no
high
*NL*
place
nor
lowly
place
,
where
thou
couldst
have
escaped
me
--
save
*NL*
on
this
very
scaffold
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
be
to
Him
who
hath
led
me
hither
!
''
answered
the
*NL*
minister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
trembled
,
and
turned
to
Hester
,
with
an
expression
of
*NL*
doubt
and
anxiety
in
his
eyes
,
not
the
less
evidently
betrayed
,
*NL*
that
there
was
a
feeble
smile
upon
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
this
better
,
''
murmured
he
,
``
than
what
we
dreamed
of
in
*NL*
the
forest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
!
I
know
not
!
''
she
hurriedly
replied
.
``
Better
?
Yea
;
*NL*
so
we
may
both
die
,
and
little
Pearl
die
with
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
thee
and
Pearl
,
be
it
as
God
shall
order
,
''
said
the
*NL*
minister
;
``
and
God
is
merciful
!
Let
me
now
do
the
will
which
He
*NL*
hath
made
plain
before
my
sight
.
For
,
Hester
,
I
am
a
dying
man
.
*NL*
So
let
me
make
haste
to
take
my
shame
upon
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Partly
supported
by
Hester
Prynne
,
and
holding
one
hand
of
*NL*
little
Pearl
's
,
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
turned
to
the
*NL*
dignified
and
venerable
rulers
;
to
the
holy
ministers
,
who
were
*NL*
his
brethren
;
to
the
people
,
whose
great
heart
was
thoroughly
*NL*
appalled
yet
overflowing
with
tearful
sympathy
,
as
knowing
that
*NL*
some
deep
life-matter
--
which
,
if
full
of
sin
,
was
full
of
*NL*
anguish
and
repentance
likewise
--
was
now
to
be
laid
open
to
*NL*
them
.
The
sun
,
but
little
past
its
meridian
,
shone
down
upon
the
*NL*
clergyman
,
and
gave
a
distinctness
to
his
figure
,
as
he
stood
*NL*
out
from
all
the
earth
,
to
put
in
his
plea
of
guilty
at
the
bar
*NL*
of
Eternal
Justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
of
New
England
!
''
cried
he
,
with
a
voice
that
rose
over
*NL*
them
,
high
,
solemn
,
and
majestic
--
yet
had
always
a
tremor
*NL*
through
it
,
and
sometimes
a
shriek
,
struggling
up
out
of
a
*NL*
fathomless
depth
of
remorse
and
woe
--
``
ye
,
that
have
loved
*NL*
me
!
--
ye
,
that
have
deemed
me
holy
!
--
behold
me
here
,
the
one
*NL*
sinner
of
the
world
!
At
last
--
at
last
!
--
I
stand
upon
the
spot
*NL*
where
,
seven
years
since
,
I
should
have
stood
,
here
,
with
this
*NL*
woman
,
whose
arm
,
more
than
the
little
strength
wherewith
I
have
*NL*
crept
hitherward
,
sustains
me
at
this
dreadful
moment
,
from
*NL*
grovelling
down
upon
my
face
!
Lo
,
the
scarlet
letter
which
*NL*
Hester
wears
!
Ye
have
all
shuddered
at
it
!
Wherever
her
walk
*NL*
hath
been
--
wherever
,
so
miserably
burdened
,
she
may
have
hoped
*NL*
to
find
repose
--
it
hath
cast
a
lurid
gleam
of
awe
and
horrible
*NL*
repugnance
round
about
her
.
But
there
stood
one
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
you
,
at
whose
brand
of
sin
and
infamy
ye
have
not
shuddered
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
,
at
this
point
,
as
if
the
minister
must
leave
the
*NL*
remainder
of
his
secret
undisclosed
.
But
he
fought
back
the
*NL*
bodily
weakness
--
and
,
still
more
,
the
faintness
of
heart
--
that
*NL*
was
striving
for
the
mastery
with
him
.
He
threw
off
all
*NL*
assistance
,
and
stepped
passionately
forward
a
pace
before
the
*NL*
woman
and
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
on
him
!
''
he
continued
,
with
a
kind
of
fierceness
;
so
*NL*
determined
was
he
to
speak
out
the
whole
.
``
God
's
eye
beheld
it
!
*NL*
The
angels
were
for
ever
pointing
at
it
!
-LRB-
The
Devil
knew
it
*NL*
well
,
and
fretted
it
continually
with
the
touch
of
his
burning
*NL*
finger
!
-RRB-
But
he
hid
it
cunningly
from
men
,
and
walked
among
you
*NL*
with
the
mien
of
a
spirit
,
mournful
,
because
so
pure
in
a
sinful
*NL*
world
!
--
and
sad
,
because
he
missed
his
heavenly
kindred
!
Now
,
at
*NL*
the
death-hour
,
he
stands
up
before
you
!
He
bids
you
look
again
*NL*
at
Hester
's
scarlet
letter
!
He
tells
you
,
that
,
with
all
its
*NL*
mysterious
horror
,
it
is
but
the
shadow
of
what
he
bears
on
his
*NL*
own
breast
,
and
that
even
this
,
his
own
red
stigma
,
is
no
more
*NL*
than
the
type
of
what
has
seared
his
inmost
heart
!
Stand
any
*NL*
here
that
question
God
's
judgment
on
a
sinner
!
Behold
!
Behold
,
*NL*
a
dreadful
witness
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
convulsive
motion
,
he
tore
away
the
ministerial
band
from
*NL*
before
his
breast
.
It
was
revealed
!
But
it
were
irreverent
to
*NL*
describe
that
revelation
.
For
an
instant
,
the
gaze
of
the
*NL*
horror-stricken
multitude
was
concentrated
on
the
ghastly
*NL*
miracle
;
while
the
minister
stood
,
with
a
flush
of
triumph
in
*NL*
his
face
,
as
one
who
,
in
the
crisis
of
acutest
pain
,
had
won
a
*NL*
victory
.
Then
,
down
he
sank
upon
the
scaffold
!
Hester
partly
*NL*
raised
him
,
and
supported
his
head
against
her
bosom
.
Old
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
knelt
down
beside
him
,
with
a
blank
,
dull
*NL*
countenance
,
out
of
which
the
life
seemed
to
have
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hast
escaped
me
!
''
he
repeated
more
than
once
.
``
Thou
hast
*NL*
escaped
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
God
forgive
thee
!
''
said
the
minister
.
``
Thou
,
too
,
hast
*NL*
deeply
sinned
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
withdrew
his
dying
eyes
from
the
old
man
,
and
fixed
them
on
*NL*
the
woman
and
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
Pearl
,
''
said
he
,
feebly
and
there
was
a
sweet
and
*NL*
gentle
smile
over
his
face
,
as
of
a
spirit
sinking
into
deep
*NL*
repose
;
nay
,
now
that
the
burden
was
removed
,
it
seemed
almost
*NL*
as
if
he
would
be
sportive
with
the
child
--
``
dear
little
Pearl
,
*NL*
wilt
thou
kiss
me
now
?
Thou
wouldst
not
,
yonder
,
in
the
forest
!
*NL*
But
now
thou
wilt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pearl
kissed
his
lips
.
A
spell
was
broken
.
The
great
scene
of
*NL*
grief
,
in
which
the
wild
infant
bore
a
part
had
developed
all
*NL*
her
sympathies
;
and
as
her
tears
fell
upon
her
father
's
cheek
,
*NL*
they
were
the
pledge
that
she
would
grow
up
amid
human
joy
and
*NL*
sorrow
,
nor
forever
do
battle
with
the
world
,
but
be
a
woman
in
*NL*
it
.
Towards
her
mother
,
too
,
Pearl
's
errand
as
a
messenger
of
*NL*
anguish
was
fulfilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hester
,
''
said
the
clergyman
,
``
farewell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
not
meet
again
?
''
whispered
she
,
bending
her
face
down
*NL*
close
to
his
.
``
Shall
we
not
spend
our
immortal
life
together
?
*NL*
Surely
,
surely
,
we
have
ransomed
one
another
,
with
all
this
woe
!
*NL*
Thou
lookest
far
into
eternity
,
with
those
bright
dying
eyes
!
*NL*
Then
tell
me
what
thou
seest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
Hester
--
hush
!
''
said
he
,
with
tremulous
solemnity
.
``
The
*NL*
law
we
broke
!
--
the
sin
here
awfully
revealed
!
--
let
these
alone
*NL*
be
in
thy
thoughts
!
I
fear
!
I
fear
!
It
may
be
,
that
,
when
we
*NL*
forgot
our
God
--
when
we
violated
our
reverence
each
for
the
*NL*
other
's
soul
--
it
was
thenceforth
vain
to
hope
that
we
could
meet
*NL*
hereafter
,
in
an
everlasting
and
pure
reunion
.
God
knows
;
and
He
*NL*
is
merciful
!
He
hath
proved
his
mercy
,
most
of
all
,
in
my
*NL*
afflictions
.
By
giving
me
this
burning
torture
to
bear
upon
my
*NL*
breast
!
By
sending
yonder
dark
and
terrible
old
man
,
to
keep
the
*NL*
torture
always
at
red-heat
!
By
bringing
me
hither
,
to
die
this
*NL*
death
of
triumphant
ignominy
before
the
people
!
Had
either
of
*NL*
these
agonies
been
wanting
,
I
had
been
lost
for
ever
!
Praised
be
*NL*
His
name
!
His
will
be
done
!
Farewell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
final
word
came
forth
with
the
minister
's
expiring
breath
.
*NL*
The
multitude
,
silent
till
then
,
broke
out
in
a
strange
,
deep
*NL*
voice
of
awe
and
wonder
,
which
could
not
as
yet
find
utterance
,
*NL*
save
in
this
murmur
that
rolled
so
heavily
after
the
departed
*NL*
spirit
.

CONCLUSION
*NL*
*NL*
After
many
days
,
when
time
sufficed
for
the
people
to
arrange
*NL*
their
thoughts
in
reference
to
the
foregoing
scene
,
there
was
*NL*
more
than
one
account
of
what
had
been
witnessed
on
the
*NL*
scaffold
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
spectators
testified
to
having
seen
,
on
the
breast
*NL*
of
the
unhappy
minister
,
a
SCARLET
LETTER
--
the
very
semblance
of
*NL*
that
worn
by
Hester
Prynne
--
imprinted
in
the
flesh
.
As
regarded
*NL*
its
origin
there
were
various
explanations
,
all
of
which
must
*NL*
necessarily
have
been
conjectural
.
Some
affirmed
that
the
*NL*
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
on
the
very
day
when
Hester
Prynne
*NL*
first
wore
her
ignominious
badge
,
had
begun
a
course
of
*NL*
penance
--
which
he
afterwards
,
in
so
many
futile
methods
,
*NL*
followed
out
--
by
inflicting
a
hideous
torture
on
himself
.
Others
*NL*
contended
that
the
stigma
had
not
been
produced
until
a
long
*NL*
time
subsequent
,
when
old
Roger
Chillingworth
,
being
a
potent
*NL*
necromancer
,
had
caused
it
to
appear
,
through
the
agency
of
*NL*
magic
and
poisonous
drugs
.
Others
,
again
and
those
best
able
to
*NL*
appreciate
the
minister
's
peculiar
sensibility
,
and
the
*NL*
wonderful
operation
of
his
spirit
upon
the
body
--
whispered
their
*NL*
belief
,
that
the
awful
symbol
was
the
effect
of
the
ever-active
*NL*
tooth
of
remorse
,
gnawing
from
the
inmost
heart
outwardly
,
and
*NL*
at
last
manifesting
Heaven
's
dreadful
judgment
by
the
visible
*NL*
presence
of
the
letter
.
The
reader
may
choose
among
these
*NL*
theories
.
We
have
thrown
all
the
light
we
could
acquire
upon
the
*NL*
portent
,
and
would
gladly
,
now
that
it
has
done
its
office
,
*NL*
erase
its
deep
print
out
of
our
own
brain
,
where
long
meditation
*NL*
has
fixed
it
in
very
undesirable
distinctness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
singular
,
nevertheless
,
that
certain
persons
,
who
were
*NL*
spectators
of
the
whole
scene
,
and
professed
never
once
to
have
*NL*
removed
their
eyes
from
the
Reverend
Mr.
Dimmesdale
,
denied
that
*NL*
there
was
any
mark
whatever
on
his
breast
,
more
than
on
a
*NL*
new-born
infant
's
.
Neither
,
by
their
report
,
had
his
dying
words
*NL*
acknowledged
,
nor
even
remotely
implied
,
any
--
the
*NL*
slightest
--
connexion
on
his
part
,
with
the
guilt
for
which
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
had
so
long
worn
the
scarlet
letter
.
According
to
*NL*
these
highly-respectable
witnesses
,
the
minister
,
conscious
that
*NL*
he
was
dying
--
conscious
,
also
,
that
the
reverence
of
the
*NL*
multitude
placed
him
already
among
saints
and
angels
--
had
*NL*
desired
,
by
yielding
up
his
breath
in
the
arms
of
that
fallen
*NL*
woman
,
to
express
to
the
world
how
utterly
nugatory
is
the
*NL*
choicest
of
man
's
own
righteousness
.
After
exhausting
life
in
*NL*
his
efforts
for
mankind
's
spiritual
good
,
he
had
made
the
manner
*NL*
of
his
death
a
parable
,
in
order
to
impress
on
his
admirers
the
*NL*
mighty
and
mournful
lesson
,
that
,
in
the
view
of
Infinite
*NL*
Purity
,
we
are
sinners
all
alike
.
It
was
to
teach
them
,
that
the
*NL*
holiest
amongst
us
has
but
attained
so
far
above
his
fellows
as
*NL*
to
discern
more
clearly
the
Mercy
which
looks
down
,
and
*NL*
repudiate
more
utterly
the
phantom
of
human
merit
,
which
would
*NL*
look
aspiringly
upward
.
Without
disputing
a
truth
so
momentous
,
*NL*
we
must
be
allowed
to
consider
this
version
of
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
*NL*
story
as
only
an
instance
of
that
stubborn
fidelity
with
which
a
*NL*
man
's
friends
--
and
especially
a
clergyman
's
--
will
sometimes
*NL*
uphold
his
character
,
when
proofs
,
clear
as
the
mid-day
sunshine
*NL*
on
the
scarlet
letter
,
establish
him
a
false
and
sin-stained
*NL*
creature
of
the
dust
.

The
authority
which
we
have
chiefly
followed
--
a
manuscript
of
*NL*
old
date
,
drawn
up
from
the
verbal
testimony
of
individuals
,
*NL*
some
of
whom
had
known
Hester
Prynne
,
while
others
had
heard
the
*NL*
tale
from
contemporary
witnesses
fully
confirms
the
view
taken
*NL*
in
the
foregoing
pages
.
Among
many
morals
which
press
upon
us
*NL*
from
the
poor
minister
's
miserable
experience
,
we
put
only
this
*NL*
into
a
sentence
:
--
``
Be
true
!
Be
true
!
Be
true
!
Show
freely
to
the
*NL*
world
,
if
not
your
worst
,
yet
some
trait
whereby
the
worst
may
*NL*
be
inferred
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
was
more
remarkable
than
the
change
which
took
place
,
*NL*
almost
immediately
after
Mr.
Dimmesdale
's
death
,
in
the
*NL*
appearance
and
demeanour
of
the
old
man
known
as
Roger
*NL*
Chillingworth
.
All
his
strength
and
energy
--
all
his
vital
and
*NL*
intellectual
force
--
seemed
at
once
to
desert
him
,
insomuch
that
*NL*
he
positively
withered
up
,
shrivelled
away
and
almost
vanished
*NL*
from
mortal
sight
,
like
an
uprooted
weed
that
lies
wilting
in
*NL*
the
sun
.
This
unhappy
man
had
made
the
very
principle
of
his
*NL*
life
to
consist
in
the
pursuit
and
systematic
exercise
of
*NL*
revenge
;
and
when
,
by
its
completest
triumph
consummation
that
*NL*
evil
principle
was
left
with
no
further
material
to
support
*NL*
it
--
when
,
in
short
,
there
was
no
more
Devil
's
work
on
earth
for
*NL*
him
to
do
,
it
only
remained
for
the
unhumanised
mortal
to
betake
*NL*
himself
whither
his
master
would
find
him
tasks
enough
,
and
pay
*NL*
him
his
wages
duly
.
But
,
to
all
these
shadowy
beings
,
so
long
*NL*
our
near
acquaintances
--
as
well
Roger
Chillingworth
as
his
*NL*
companions
we
would
fain
be
merciful
.
It
is
a
curious
subject
of
*NL*
observation
and
inquiry
,
whether
hatred
and
love
be
not
the
same
*NL*
thing
at
bottom
.
Each
,
in
its
utmost
development
,
supposes
a
*NL*
high
degree
of
intimacy
and
heart-knowledge
;
each
renders
one
*NL*
individual
dependent
for
the
food
of
his
affections
and
*NL*
spiritual
fife
upon
another
:
each
leaves
the
passionate
lover
,
*NL*
or
the
no
less
passionate
hater
,
forlorn
and
desolate
by
the
*NL*
withdrawal
of
his
subject
.
Philosophically
considered
,
*NL*
therefore
,
the
two
passions
seem
essentially
the
same
,
except
*NL*
that
one
happens
to
be
seen
in
a
celestial
radiance
,
and
the
*NL*
other
in
a
dusky
and
lurid
glow
.
In
the
spiritual
world
,
the
old
*NL*
physician
and
the
minister
--
mutual
victims
as
they
have
*NL*
been
--
may
,
unawares
,
have
found
their
earthly
stock
of
hatred
*NL*
and
antipathy
transmuted
into
golden
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
this
discussion
apart
,
we
have
a
matter
of
business
to
*NL*
communicate
to
the
reader
.
At
old
Roger
Chillingworth
's
decease
,
*NL*
-LRB-
which
took
place
within
the
year
-RRB-
,
and
by
his
last
will
and
*NL*
testament
,
of
which
Governor
Bellingham
and
the
Reverend
Mr.
*NL*
Wilson
were
executors
,
he
bequeathed
a
very
considerable
amount
*NL*
of
property
,
both
here
and
in
England
to
little
Pearl
,
the
*NL*
daughter
of
Hester
Prynne
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Pearl
--
the
elf
child
--
the
demon
offspring
,
as
some
people
up
*NL*
to
that
epoch
persisted
in
considering
her
--
became
the
richest
*NL*
heiress
of
her
day
in
the
New
World
.
Not
improbably
this
*NL*
circumstance
wrought
a
very
material
change
in
the
public
*NL*
estimation
;
and
had
the
mother
and
child
remained
here
,
little
*NL*
Pearl
at
a
marriageable
period
of
life
might
have
mingled
her
*NL*
wild
blood
with
the
lineage
of
the
devoutest
Puritan
among
them
*NL*
all
.
But
,
in
no
long
time
after
the
physician
's
death
,
the
*NL*
wearer
of
the
scarlet
letter
disappeared
,
and
Pearl
along
with
*NL*
her
.
For
many
years
,
though
a
vague
report
would
now
and
then
*NL*
find
its
way
across
the
sea
--
like
a
shapeless
piece
of
driftwood
*NL*
tossed
ashore
with
the
initials
of
a
name
upon
it
--
yet
no
*NL*
tidings
of
them
unquestionably
authentic
were
received
.
The
*NL*
story
of
the
scarlet
letter
grew
into
a
legend
.
Its
spell
,
*NL*
however
,
was
still
potent
,
and
kept
the
scaffold
awful
where
the
*NL*
poor
minister
had
died
,
and
likewise
the
cottage
by
the
*NL*
sea-shore
where
Hester
Prynne
had
dwelt
.
Near
this
latter
spot
,
*NL*
one
afternoon
some
children
were
at
play
,
when
they
beheld
a
*NL*
tall
woman
in
a
gray
robe
approach
the
cottage-door
.
In
all
*NL*
those
years
it
had
never
once
been
opened
;
but
either
she
*NL*
unlocked
it
or
the
decaying
wood
and
iron
yielded
to
her
hand
,
*NL*
or
she
glided
shadow-like
through
these
impediments
--
and
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
threshold
she
paused
--
turned
partly
round
--
for
perchance
*NL*
the
idea
of
entering
alone
and
all
so
changed
,
the
home
of
so
*NL*
intense
a
former
life
,
was
more
dreary
and
desolate
than
even
*NL*
she
could
bear
.
But
her
hesitation
was
only
for
an
instant
,
*NL*
though
long
enough
to
display
a
scarlet
letter
on
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Hester
Prynne
had
returned
,
and
taken
up
her
long-forsaken
*NL*
shame
!
But
where
was
little
Pearl
?
If
still
alive
she
must
now
*NL*
have
been
in
the
flush
and
bloom
of
early
womanhood
.
None
*NL*
knew
--
nor
ever
learned
with
the
fulness
of
perfect
*NL*
certainty
--
whether
the
elf-child
had
gone
thus
untimely
to
a
*NL*
maiden
grave
;
or
whether
her
wild
,
rich
nature
had
been
softened
*NL*
and
subdued
and
made
capable
of
a
woman
's
gentle
happiness
.
But
*NL*
through
the
remainder
of
Hester
's
life
there
were
indications
*NL*
that
the
recluse
of
the
scarlet
letter
was
the
object
of
love
*NL*
and
interest
with
some
inhabitant
of
another
land
.
Letters
came
,
*NL*
with
armorial
seals
upon
them
,
though
of
bearings
unknown
to
*NL*
English
heraldry
.
In
the
cottage
there
were
articles
of
comfort
*NL*
and
luxury
such
as
Hester
never
cared
to
use
,
but
which
only
*NL*
wealth
could
have
purchased
and
affection
have
imagined
for
her
.
*NL*
There
were
trifles
too
,
little
ornaments
,
beautiful
tokens
of
a
*NL*
continual
remembrance
,
that
must
have
been
wrought
by
delicate
*NL*
fingers
at
the
impulse
of
a
fond
heart
.
And
once
Hester
was
seen
*NL*
embroidering
a
baby-garment
with
such
a
lavish
richness
of
*NL*
golden
fancy
as
would
have
raised
a
public
tumult
had
any
infant
*NL*
thus
apparelled
,
been
shown
to
our
sober-hued
community
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fine
,
the
gossips
of
that
day
believed
--
and
Mr.
Surveyor
Pue
,
*NL*
who
made
investigations
a
century
later
,
believed
--
and
one
of
*NL*
his
recent
successors
in
office
,
moreover
,
faithfully
*NL*
believes
--
that
Pearl
was
not
only
alive
,
but
married
,
and
happy
,
*NL*
and
mindful
of
her
mother
;
and
that
she
would
most
joyfully
have
*NL*
entertained
that
sad
and
lonely
mother
at
her
fireside
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
a
more
real
life
for
Hester
Prynne
,
here
,
in
New
*NL*
England
,
than
in
that
unknown
region
where
Pearl
had
found
a
*NL*
home
.
Here
had
been
her
sin
;
here
,
her
sorrow
;
and
here
was
yet
*NL*
to
be
her
penitence
.
She
had
returned
,
therefore
,
and
resumed
--
of
*NL*
her
own
free
will
,
for
not
the
sternest
magistrate
of
that
iron
*NL*
period
would
have
imposed
it
--
resumed
the
symbol
of
which
we
*NL*
have
related
so
dark
a
tale
.
Never
afterwards
did
it
quit
her
*NL*
bosom
.
But
,
in
the
lapse
of
the
toilsome
,
thoughtful
,
and
*NL*
self-devoted
years
that
made
up
Hester
's
life
,
the
scarlet
*NL*
letter
ceased
to
be
a
stigma
which
attracted
the
world
's
scorn
*NL*
and
bitterness
,
and
became
a
type
of
something
to
be
sorrowed
*NL*
over
,
and
looked
upon
with
awe
,
yet
with
reverence
too
.
And
,
as
*NL*
Hester
Prynne
had
no
selfish
ends
,
nor
lived
in
any
measure
for
*NL*
her
own
profit
and
enjoyment
,
people
brought
all
their
sorrows
*NL*
and
perplexities
,
and
besought
her
counsel
,
as
one
who
had
*NL*
herself
gone
through
a
mighty
trouble
.
Women
,
more
*NL*
especially
--
in
the
continually
recurring
trials
of
wounded
,
*NL*
wasted
,
wronged
,
misplaced
,
or
erring
and
sinful
passion
--
or
*NL*
with
the
dreary
burden
of
a
heart
unyielded
,
because
unvalued
*NL*
and
unsought
came
to
Hester
's
cottage
,
demanding
why
they
were
*NL*
so
wretched
,
and
what
the
remedy
!
Hester
comforted
and
*NL*
counselled
them
,
as
best
she
might
.
She
assured
them
,
too
,
of
*NL*
her
firm
belief
that
,
at
some
brighter
period
,
when
the
world
*NL*
should
have
grown
ripe
for
it
,
in
Heaven
's
own
time
,
a
new
truth
*NL*
would
be
revealed
,
in
order
to
establish
the
whole
relation
*NL*
between
man
and
woman
on
a
surer
ground
of
mutual
happiness
.
*NL*
Earlier
in
life
,
Hester
had
vainly
imagined
that
she
herself
*NL*
might
be
the
destined
prophetess
,
but
had
long
since
recognised
*NL*
the
impossibility
that
any
mission
of
divine
and
mysterious
*NL*
truth
should
be
confided
to
a
woman
stained
with
sin
,
bowed
down
*NL*
with
shame
,
or
even
burdened
with
a
life-long
sorrow
.
The
angel
*NL*
and
apostle
of
the
coming
revelation
must
be
a
woman
,
indeed
,
*NL*
but
lofty
,
pure
,
and
beautiful
,
and
wise
;
moreover
,
not
through
*NL*
dusky
grief
,
but
the
ethereal
medium
of
joy
;
and
showing
how
*NL*
sacred
love
should
make
us
happy
,
by
the
truest
test
of
a
life
*NL*
successful
to
such
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
said
Hester
Prynne
,
and
glanced
her
sad
eyes
downward
at
the
*NL*
scarlet
letter
.
And
,
after
many
,
many
years
,
a
new
grave
was
*NL*
delved
,
near
an
old
and
sunken
one
,
in
that
burial-ground
beside
*NL*
which
King
's
Chapel
has
since
been
built
.
It
was
near
that
old
*NL*
and
sunken
grave
,
yet
with
a
space
between
,
as
if
the
dust
of
*NL*
the
two
sleepers
had
no
right
to
mingle
.
Yet
one
tomb-stone
*NL*
served
for
both
.
All
around
,
there
were
monuments
carved
with
*NL*
armorial
bearings
;
and
on
this
simple
slab
of
slate
--
as
the
*NL*
curious
investigator
may
still
discern
,
and
perplex
himself
with
*NL*
the
purport
--
there
appeared
the
semblance
of
an
engraved
*NL*
escutcheon
.
It
bore
a
device
,
a
herald
's
wording
of
which
may
*NL*
serve
for
a
motto
and
brief
description
of
our
now
concluded
*NL*
legend
;
so
sombre
is
it
,
and
relieved
only
by
one
ever-glowing
*NL*
point
of
light
gloomier
than
the
shadow
:
