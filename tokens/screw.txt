THE
TURN
OF
THE
SCREW
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
had
held
us
,
round
the
fire
,
sufficiently
breathless
,
but
*NL*
except
the
obvious
remark
that
it
was
gruesome
,
as
,
on
Christmas
Eve
*NL*
in
an
old
house
,
a
strange
tale
should
essentially
be
,
I
remember
no
*NL*
comment
uttered
till
somebody
happened
to
say
that
it
was
the
only
case
*NL*
he
had
met
in
which
such
a
visitation
had
fallen
on
a
child
.
The
case
,
I
*NL*
may
mention
,
was
that
of
an
apparition
in
just
such
an
old
house
as
had
*NL*
gathered
us
for
the
occasion
--
an
appearance
,
of
a
dreadful
kind
,
to
a
*NL*
little
boy
sleeping
in
the
room
with
his
mother
and
waking
her
up
in
the
*NL*
terror
of
it
;
waking
her
not
to
dissipate
his
dread
and
soothe
him
to
*NL*
sleep
again
,
but
to
encounter
also
,
herself
,
before
she
had
succeeded
*NL*
in
doing
so
,
the
same
sight
that
had
shaken
him
.
It
was
this
observation
*NL*
that
drew
from
Douglas
--
not
immediately
,
but
later
in
the
evening
--
a
*NL*
reply
that
had
the
interesting
consequence
to
which
I
call
attention
.
*NL*
Someone
else
told
a
story
not
particularly
effective
,
which
I
saw
he
was
*NL*
not
following
.
This
I
took
for
a
sign
that
he
had
himself
something
to
*NL*
produce
and
that
we
should
only
have
to
wait
.
We
waited
in
fact
till
two
*NL*
nights
later
;
but
that
same
evening
,
before
we
scattered
,
he
brought
out
*NL*
what
was
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
agree
--
in
regard
to
Griffin
's
ghost
,
or
whatever
it
was
--
that
*NL*
its
appearing
first
to
the
little
boy
,
at
so
tender
an
age
,
adds
a
*NL*
particular
touch
.
But
it
's
not
the
first
occurrence
of
its
charming
*NL*
kind
that
I
know
to
have
involved
a
child
.
If
the
child
gives
the
effect
*NL*
another
turn
of
the
screw
,
what
do
you
say
to
TWO
children
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
say
,
of
course
,
''
somebody
exclaimed
,
``
that
they
give
two
turns
!
Also
*NL*
that
we
want
to
hear
about
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
see
Douglas
there
before
the
fire
,
to
which
he
had
got
up
to
*NL*
present
his
back
,
looking
down
at
his
interlocutor
with
his
hands
in
*NL*
his
pockets
.
``
Nobody
but
me
,
till
now
,
has
ever
heard
.
It
's
quite
too
*NL*
horrible
.
''
This
,
naturally
,
was
declared
by
several
voices
to
give
the
*NL*
thing
the
utmost
price
,
and
our
friend
,
with
quiet
art
,
prepared
his
*NL*
triumph
by
turning
his
eyes
over
the
rest
of
us
and
going
on
:
``
It
's
*NL*
beyond
everything
.
Nothing
at
all
that
I
know
touches
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
sheer
terror
?
''
I
remember
asking
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
say
it
was
not
so
simple
as
that
;
to
be
really
at
a
loss
*NL*
how
to
qualify
it
.
He
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
,
made
a
little
*NL*
wincing
grimace
.
``
For
dreadful
--
dreadfulness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
delicious
!
''
cried
one
of
the
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
no
notice
of
her
;
he
looked
at
me
,
but
as
if
,
instead
of
me
,
*NL*
he
saw
what
he
spoke
of
.
``
For
general
uncanny
ugliness
and
horror
and
*NL*
pain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
I
said
,
``
just
sit
right
down
and
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
round
to
the
fire
,
gave
a
kick
to
a
log
,
watched
it
an
*NL*
instant
.
Then
as
he
faced
us
again
:
``
I
ca
n't
begin
.
I
shall
have
to
send
*NL*
to
town
.
''
There
was
a
unanimous
groan
at
this
,
and
much
reproach
;
after
*NL*
which
,
in
his
preoccupied
way
,
he
explained
.
``
The
story
's
written
.
It
's
*NL*
in
a
locked
drawer
--
it
has
not
been
out
for
years
.
I
could
write
to
my
*NL*
man
and
enclose
the
key
;
he
could
send
down
the
packet
as
he
finds
it
.
''
*NL*
It
was
to
me
in
particular
that
he
appeared
to
propound
this
--
appeared
*NL*
almost
to
appeal
for
aid
not
to
hesitate
.
He
had
broken
a
thickness
*NL*
of
ice
,
the
formation
of
many
a
winter
;
had
had
his
reasons
for
a
long
*NL*
silence
.
The
others
resented
postponement
,
but
it
was
just
his
scruples
*NL*
that
charmed
me
.
I
adjured
him
to
write
by
the
first
post
and
to
agree
*NL*
with
us
for
an
early
hearing
;
then
I
asked
him
if
the
experience
in
*NL*
question
had
been
his
own
.
To
this
his
answer
was
prompt
.
``
Oh
,
thank
*NL*
God
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
the
record
yours
?
You
took
the
thing
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
but
the
impression
.
I
took
that
HERE
''
--
he
tapped
his
heart
.
*NL*
``
I
've
never
lost
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
your
manuscript
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
in
old
,
faded
ink
,
and
in
the
most
beautiful
hand
.
''
He
hung
fire
*NL*
again
.
``
A
woman
's
.
She
has
been
dead
these
twenty
years
.
She
sent
me
the
*NL*
pages
in
question
before
she
died
.
''
They
were
all
listening
now
,
and
*NL*
of
course
there
was
somebody
to
be
arch
,
or
at
any
rate
to
draw
the
*NL*
inference
.
But
if
he
put
the
inference
by
without
a
smile
it
was
also
*NL*
without
irritation
.
``
She
was
a
most
charming
person
,
but
she
was
ten
*NL*
years
older
than
I
.
She
was
my
sister
's
governess
,
''
he
quietly
said
.
*NL*
``
She
was
the
most
agreeable
woman
I
've
ever
known
in
her
position
;
*NL*
she
would
have
been
worthy
of
any
whatever
.
It
was
long
ago
,
and
this
*NL*
episode
was
long
before
.
I
was
at
Trinity
,
and
I
found
her
at
home
on
*NL*
my
coming
down
the
second
summer
.
I
was
much
there
that
year
--
it
was
a
*NL*
beautiful
one
;
and
we
had
,
in
her
off-hours
,
some
strolls
and
talks
in
*NL*
the
garden
--
talks
in
which
she
struck
me
as
awfully
clever
and
nice
.
Oh
*NL*
yes
;
do
n't
grin
:
I
liked
her
extremely
and
am
glad
to
this
day
to
think
*NL*
she
liked
me
,
too
.
If
she
had
n't
she
would
n't
have
told
me
.
She
had
*NL*
never
told
anyone
.
It
was
n't
simply
that
she
said
so
,
but
that
I
knew
*NL*
she
had
n't
.
I
was
sure
;
I
could
see
.
You
'll
easily
judge
why
when
you
*NL*
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
the
thing
had
been
such
a
scare
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
fix
me
.
``
You
'll
easily
judge
,
''
he
repeated
:
``
YOU
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
fixed
him
,
too
.
``
I
see
.
She
was
in
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
for
the
first
time
.
``
You
ARE
acute
.
Yes
,
she
was
in
love
.
*NL*
That
is
,
she
had
been
.
That
came
out
--
she
could
n't
tell
her
story
*NL*
without
its
coming
out
.
I
saw
it
,
and
she
saw
I
saw
it
;
but
neither
of
*NL*
us
spoke
of
it
.
I
remember
the
time
and
the
place
--
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
lawn
,
the
shade
of
the
great
beeches
and
the
long
,
hot
summer
afternoon
.
*NL*
It
was
n't
a
scene
for
a
shudder
;
but
oh
--
!
''
He
quitted
the
fire
and
*NL*
dropped
back
into
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
receive
the
packet
Thursday
morning
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
not
till
the
second
post
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
;
after
dinner
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
all
meet
me
here
?
''
He
looked
us
round
again
.
``
Is
n't
anybody
*NL*
going
?
''
It
was
almost
the
tone
of
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
will
stay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
will
''
--
and
''
_
I
_
will
!
''
cried
the
ladies
whose
departure
had
been
*NL*
fixed
.
Mrs.
Griffin
,
however
,
expressed
the
need
for
a
little
more
*NL*
light
.
``
Who
was
it
she
was
in
love
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
story
will
tell
,
''
I
took
upon
myself
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
wait
for
the
story
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
story
WO
N'T
tell
,
''
said
Douglas
;
``
not
in
any
literal
,
vulgar
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
's
the
pity
,
then
.
That
's
the
only
way
I
ever
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
YOU
tell
,
Douglas
?
''
somebody
else
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sprang
to
his
feet
again
.
``
Yes
--
tomorrow
.
Now
I
must
go
to
bed
.
*NL*
Good
night
.
''
And
quickly
catching
up
a
candlestick
,
he
left
us
slightly
*NL*
bewildered
.
From
our
end
of
the
great
brown
hall
we
heard
his
step
on
*NL*
the
stair
;
whereupon
Mrs.
Griffin
spoke
.
``
Well
,
if
I
do
n't
know
who
she
*NL*
was
in
love
with
,
I
know
who
HE
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
ten
years
older
,
''
said
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Raison
de
plus
--
at
that
age
!
But
it
's
rather
nice
,
his
long
reticence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forty
years
!
''
Griffin
put
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
this
outbreak
at
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
outbreak
,
''
I
returned
,
``
will
make
a
tremendous
occasion
of
Thursday
*NL*
night
;
''
and
everyone
so
agreed
with
me
that
,
in
the
light
of
it
,
we
lost
*NL*
all
attention
for
everything
else
.
The
last
story
,
however
incomplete
*NL*
and
like
the
mere
opening
of
a
serial
,
had
been
told
;
we
handshook
and
*NL*
``
candlestuck
,
''
as
somebody
said
,
and
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
the
next
day
that
a
letter
containing
the
key
had
,
by
the
first
*NL*
post
,
gone
off
to
his
London
apartments
;
but
in
spite
of
--
or
perhaps
*NL*
just
on
account
of
--
the
eventual
diffusion
of
this
knowledge
we
quite
*NL*
let
him
alone
till
after
dinner
,
till
such
an
hour
of
the
evening
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
as
might
best
accord
with
the
kind
of
emotion
on
which
our
hopes
*NL*
were
fixed
.
Then
he
became
as
communicative
as
we
could
desire
and
*NL*
indeed
gave
us
his
best
reason
for
being
so
.
We
had
it
from
him
again
*NL*
before
the
fire
in
the
hall
,
as
we
had
had
our
mild
wonders
of
the
*NL*
previous
night
.
It
appeared
that
the
narrative
he
had
promised
to
read
*NL*
us
really
required
for
a
proper
intelligence
a
few
words
of
prologue
.
*NL*
Let
me
say
here
distinctly
,
to
have
done
with
it
,
that
this
narrative
,
*NL*
from
an
exact
transcript
of
my
own
made
much
later
,
is
what
I
shall
*NL*
presently
give
.
Poor
Douglas
,
before
his
death
--
when
it
was
in
*NL*
sight
--
committed
to
me
the
manuscript
that
reached
him
on
the
third
of
*NL*
these
days
and
that
,
on
the
same
spot
,
with
immense
effect
,
he
began
*NL*
to
read
to
our
hushed
little
circle
on
the
night
of
the
fourth
.
The
*NL*
departing
ladies
who
had
said
they
would
stay
did
n't
,
of
course
,
thank
*NL*
heaven
,
stay
:
they
departed
,
in
consequence
of
arrangements
made
,
in
a
*NL*
rage
of
curiosity
,
as
they
professed
,
produced
by
the
touches
with
*NL*
which
he
had
already
worked
us
up
.
But
that
only
made
his
little
final
*NL*
auditory
more
compact
and
select
,
kept
it
,
round
the
hearth
,
subject
to
*NL*
a
common
thrill
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
of
these
touches
conveyed
that
the
written
statement
took
up
*NL*
the
tale
at
a
point
after
it
had
,
in
a
manner
,
begun
.
The
fact
to
be
in
*NL*
possession
of
was
therefore
that
his
old
friend
,
the
youngest
of
several
*NL*
daughters
of
a
poor
country
parson
,
had
,
at
the
age
of
twenty
,
on
taking
*NL*
service
for
the
first
time
in
the
schoolroom
,
come
up
to
London
,
in
*NL*
trepidation
,
to
answer
in
person
an
advertisement
that
had
already
*NL*
placed
her
in
brief
correspondence
with
the
advertiser
.
This
person
*NL*
proved
,
on
her
presenting
herself
,
for
judgment
,
at
a
house
in
Harley
*NL*
Street
,
that
impressed
her
as
vast
and
imposing
--
this
prospective
patron
*NL*
proved
a
gentleman
,
a
bachelor
in
the
prime
of
life
,
such
a
figure
as
*NL*
had
never
risen
,
save
in
a
dream
or
an
old
novel
,
before
a
fluttered
,
*NL*
anxious
girl
out
of
a
Hampshire
vicarage
.
One
could
easily
fix
his
type
;
*NL*
it
never
,
happily
,
dies
out
.
He
was
handsome
and
bold
and
pleasant
,
*NL*
offhand
and
gay
and
kind
.
He
struck
her
,
inevitably
,
as
gallant
and
*NL*
splendid
,
but
what
took
her
most
of
all
and
gave
her
the
courage
she
*NL*
afterward
showed
was
that
he
put
the
whole
thing
to
her
as
a
kind
of
*NL*
favor
,
an
obligation
he
should
gratefully
incur
.
She
conceived
him
*NL*
as
rich
,
but
as
fearfully
extravagant
--
saw
him
all
in
a
glow
of
high
*NL*
fashion
,
of
good
looks
,
of
expensive
habits
,
of
charming
ways
with
*NL*
women
.
He
had
for
his
own
town
residence
a
big
house
filled
with
the
*NL*
spoils
of
travel
and
the
trophies
of
the
chase
;
but
it
was
to
his
*NL*
country
home
,
an
old
family
place
in
Essex
,
that
he
wished
her
*NL*
immediately
to
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
left
,
by
the
death
of
their
parents
in
India
,
guardian
to
*NL*
a
small
nephew
and
a
small
niece
,
children
of
a
younger
,
a
military
*NL*
brother
,
whom
he
had
lost
two
years
before
.
These
children
were
,
by
the
*NL*
strangest
of
chances
for
a
man
in
his
position
--
a
lone
man
without
the
*NL*
right
sort
of
experience
or
a
grain
of
patience
--
very
heavily
on
his
*NL*
hands
.
It
had
all
been
a
great
worry
and
,
on
his
own
part
doubtless
,
a
*NL*
series
of
blunders
,
but
he
immensely
pitied
the
poor
chicks
and
had
done
*NL*
all
he
could
;
had
in
particular
sent
them
down
to
his
other
house
,
the
*NL*
proper
place
for
them
being
of
course
the
country
,
and
kept
them
there
,
*NL*
from
the
first
,
with
the
best
people
he
could
find
to
look
after
them
,
*NL*
parting
even
with
his
own
servants
to
wait
on
them
and
going
down
*NL*
himself
,
whenever
he
might
,
to
see
how
they
were
doing
.
The
awkward
*NL*
thing
was
that
they
had
practically
no
other
relations
and
that
his
*NL*
own
affairs
took
up
all
his
time
.
He
had
put
them
in
possession
of
Bly
,
*NL*
which
was
healthy
and
secure
,
and
had
placed
at
the
head
of
their
little
*NL*
establishment
--
but
below
stairs
only
--
an
excellent
woman
,
Mrs.
Grose
,
*NL*
whom
he
was
sure
his
visitor
would
like
and
who
had
formerly
been
maid
*NL*
to
his
mother
.
She
was
now
housekeeper
and
was
also
acting
for
the
time
*NL*
as
superintendent
to
the
little
girl
,
of
whom
,
without
children
of
her
*NL*
own
,
she
was
,
by
good
luck
,
extremely
fond
.
There
were
plenty
of
people
*NL*
to
help
,
but
of
course
the
young
lady
who
should
go
down
as
governess
*NL*
would
be
in
supreme
authority
.
She
would
also
have
,
in
holidays
,
to
look
*NL*
after
the
small
boy
,
who
had
been
for
a
term
at
school
--
young
as
he
was
*NL*
to
be
sent
,
but
what
else
could
be
done
?
--
and
who
,
as
the
holidays
were
*NL*
about
to
begin
,
would
be
back
from
one
day
to
the
other
.
There
had
*NL*
been
for
the
two
children
at
first
a
young
lady
whom
they
had
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
to
lose
.
She
had
done
for
them
quite
beautifully
--
she
was
a
*NL*
most
respectable
person
--
till
her
death
,
the
great
awkwardness
of
which
*NL*
had
,
precisely
,
left
no
alternative
but
the
school
for
little
Miles
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
,
since
then
,
in
the
way
of
manners
and
things
,
had
done
as
*NL*
she
could
for
Flora
;
and
there
were
,
further
,
a
cook
,
a
housemaid
,
a
*NL*
dairywoman
,
an
old
pony
,
an
old
groom
,
and
an
old
gardener
,
all
likewise
*NL*
thoroughly
respectable
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
had
Douglas
presented
his
picture
when
someone
put
a
question
.
*NL*
``
And
what
did
the
former
governess
die
of
?
--
of
so
much
respectability
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
's
answer
was
prompt
.
``
That
will
come
out
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
anticipate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
--
I
thought
that
was
just
what
you
ARE
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
her
successor
's
place
,
''
I
suggested
,
``
I
should
have
wished
to
learn
*NL*
if
the
office
brought
with
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Necessary
danger
to
life
?
''
Douglas
completed
my
thought
.
``
She
did
wish
*NL*
to
learn
,
and
she
did
learn
.
You
shall
hear
tomorrow
what
she
learned
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
of
course
,
the
prospect
struck
her
as
slightly
grim
.
She
was
*NL*
young
,
untried
,
nervous
:
it
was
a
vision
of
serious
duties
and
little
*NL*
company
,
of
really
great
loneliness
.
She
hesitated
--
took
a
couple
of
*NL*
days
to
consult
and
consider
.
But
the
salary
offered
much
exceeded
*NL*
her
modest
measure
,
and
on
a
second
interview
she
faced
the
music
,
she
*NL*
engaged
.
''
And
Douglas
,
with
this
,
made
a
pause
that
,
for
the
benefit
of
*NL*
the
company
,
moved
me
to
throw
in
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
moral
of
which
was
of
course
the
seduction
exercised
by
the
*NL*
splendid
young
man
.
She
succumbed
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
,
as
he
had
done
the
night
before
,
went
to
the
fire
,
gave
*NL*
a
stir
to
a
log
with
his
foot
,
then
stood
a
moment
with
his
back
to
us
.
*NL*
``
She
saw
him
only
twice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
that
's
just
the
beauty
of
her
passion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
to
my
surprise
,
on
this
,
Douglas
turned
round
to
me
.
``
It
WAS
*NL*
the
beauty
of
it
.
There
were
others
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
who
had
n't
succumbed
.
*NL*
He
told
her
frankly
all
his
difficulty
--
that
for
several
applicants
the
*NL*
conditions
had
been
prohibitive
.
They
were
,
somehow
,
simply
afraid
.
It
*NL*
sounded
dull
--
it
sounded
strange
;
and
all
the
more
so
because
of
his
*NL*
main
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
was
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
she
should
never
trouble
him
--
but
never
,
never
:
neither
appeal
*NL*
nor
complain
nor
write
about
anything
;
only
meet
all
questions
herself
,
*NL*
receive
all
moneys
from
his
solicitor
,
take
the
whole
thing
over
and
let
*NL*
him
alone
.
She
promised
to
do
this
,
and
she
mentioned
to
me
that
when
,
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
disburdened
,
delighted
,
he
held
her
hand
,
thanking
her
for
*NL*
the
sacrifice
,
she
already
felt
rewarded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
was
that
all
her
reward
?
''
one
of
the
ladies
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
saw
him
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
the
lady
;
which
,
as
our
friend
immediately
left
us
again
,
was
*NL*
the
only
other
word
of
importance
contributed
to
the
subject
till
,
the
*NL*
next
night
,
by
the
corner
of
the
hearth
,
in
the
best
chair
,
he
opened
*NL*
the
faded
red
cover
of
a
thin
old-fashioned
gilt-edged
album
.
The
whole
*NL*
thing
took
indeed
more
nights
than
one
,
but
on
the
first
occasion
the
*NL*
same
lady
put
another
question
.
``
What
is
your
title
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
I
_
have
!
''
I
said
.
But
Douglas
,
without
heeding
me
,
had
begun
to
*NL*
read
with
a
fine
clearness
that
was
like
a
rendering
to
the
ear
of
the
*NL*
beauty
of
his
author
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
the
whole
beginning
as
a
succession
of
flights
and
drops
,
a
*NL*
little
seesaw
of
the
right
throbs
and
the
wrong
.
After
rising
,
in
town
,
*NL*
to
meet
his
appeal
,
I
had
at
all
events
a
couple
of
very
bad
days
--
found
*NL*
myself
doubtful
again
,
felt
indeed
sure
I
had
made
a
mistake
.
In
this
*NL*
state
of
mind
I
spent
the
long
hours
of
bumping
,
swinging
coach
that
*NL*
carried
me
to
the
stopping
place
at
which
I
was
to
be
met
by
a
vehicle
*NL*
from
the
house
.
This
convenience
,
I
was
told
,
had
been
ordered
,
and
*NL*
I
found
,
toward
the
close
of
the
June
afternoon
,
a
commodious
fly
in
*NL*
waiting
for
me
.
Driving
at
that
hour
,
on
a
lovely
day
,
through
a
country
*NL*
to
which
the
summer
sweetness
seemed
to
offer
me
a
friendly
welcome
,
my
*NL*
fortitude
mounted
afresh
and
,
as
we
turned
into
the
avenue
,
encountered
*NL*
a
reprieve
that
was
probably
but
a
proof
of
the
point
to
which
it
had
*NL*
sunk
.
I
suppose
I
had
expected
,
or
had
dreaded
,
something
so
melancholy
*NL*
that
what
greeted
me
was
a
good
surprise
.
I
remember
as
a
most
pleasant
*NL*
impression
the
broad
,
clear
front
,
its
open
windows
and
fresh
curtains
*NL*
and
the
pair
of
maids
looking
out
;
I
remember
the
lawn
and
the
bright
*NL*
flowers
and
the
crunch
of
my
wheels
on
the
gravel
and
the
clustered
*NL*
treetops
over
which
the
rooks
circled
and
cawed
in
the
golden
sky
.
The
*NL*
scene
had
a
greatness
that
made
it
a
different
affair
from
my
own
scant
*NL*
home
,
and
there
immediately
appeared
at
the
door
,
with
a
little
girl
in
*NL*
her
hand
,
a
civil
person
who
dropped
me
as
decent
a
curtsy
as
if
I
had
*NL*
been
the
mistress
or
a
distinguished
visitor
.
I
had
received
in
Harley
*NL*
Street
a
narrower
notion
of
the
place
,
and
that
,
as
I
recalled
it
,
made
*NL*
me
think
the
proprietor
still
more
of
a
gentleman
,
suggested
that
what
I
*NL*
was
to
enjoy
might
be
something
beyond
his
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
drop
again
till
the
next
day
,
for
I
was
carried
triumphantly
*NL*
through
the
following
hours
by
my
introduction
to
the
younger
of
my
*NL*
pupils
.
The
little
girl
who
accompanied
Mrs.
Grose
appeared
to
me
on
the
*NL*
spot
a
creature
so
charming
as
to
make
it
a
great
fortune
to
have
to
*NL*
do
with
her
.
She
was
the
most
beautiful
child
I
had
ever
seen
,
and
I
*NL*
afterward
wondered
that
my
employer
had
not
told
me
more
of
her
.
I
slept
*NL*
little
that
night
--
I
was
too
much
excited
;
and
this
astonished
me
,
too
,
*NL*
I
recollect
,
remained
with
me
,
adding
to
my
sense
of
the
liberality
with
*NL*
which
I
was
treated
.
The
large
,
impressive
room
,
one
of
the
best
in
*NL*
the
house
,
the
great
state
bed
,
as
I
almost
felt
it
,
the
full
,
figured
*NL*
draperies
,
the
long
glasses
in
which
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
could
see
*NL*
myself
from
head
to
foot
,
all
struck
me
--
like
the
extraordinary
charm
of
*NL*
my
small
charge
--
as
so
many
things
thrown
in
.
It
was
thrown
in
as
*NL*
well
,
from
the
first
moment
,
that
I
should
get
on
with
Mrs.
Grose
in
*NL*
a
relation
over
which
,
on
my
way
,
in
the
coach
,
I
fear
I
had
rather
*NL*
brooded
.
The
only
thing
indeed
that
in
this
early
outlook
might
have
*NL*
made
me
shrink
again
was
the
clear
circumstance
of
her
being
so
glad
*NL*
to
see
me
.
I
perceived
within
half
an
hour
that
she
was
so
glad
--
stout
,
*NL*
simple
,
plain
,
clean
,
wholesome
woman
--
as
to
be
positively
on
her
guard
*NL*
against
showing
it
too
much
.
I
wondered
even
then
a
little
why
she
*NL*
should
wish
not
to
show
it
,
and
that
,
with
reflection
,
with
suspicion
,
*NL*
might
of
course
have
made
me
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
a
comfort
that
there
could
be
no
uneasiness
in
a
connection
*NL*
with
anything
so
beatific
as
the
radiant
image
of
my
little
girl
,
the
*NL*
vision
of
whose
angelic
beauty
had
probably
more
than
anything
else
to
*NL*
do
with
the
restlessness
that
,
before
morning
,
made
me
several
times
*NL*
rise
and
wander
about
my
room
to
take
in
the
whole
picture
and
prospect
;
*NL*
to
watch
,
from
my
open
window
,
the
faint
summer
dawn
,
to
look
at
such
*NL*
portions
of
the
rest
of
the
house
as
I
could
catch
,
and
to
listen
,
*NL*
while
,
in
the
fading
dusk
,
the
first
birds
began
to
twitter
,
for
the
*NL*
possible
recurrence
of
a
sound
or
two
,
less
natural
and
not
without
,
*NL*
but
within
,
that
I
had
fancied
I
heard
.
There
had
been
a
moment
when
I
*NL*
believed
I
recognized
,
faint
and
far
,
the
cry
of
a
child
;
there
had
been
*NL*
another
when
I
found
myself
just
consciously
starting
as
at
the
passage
,
*NL*
before
my
door
,
of
a
light
footstep
.
But
these
fancies
were
not
marked
*NL*
enough
not
to
be
thrown
off
,
and
it
is
only
in
the
light
,
or
the
gloom
,
*NL*
I
should
rather
say
,
of
other
and
subsequent
matters
that
they
now
come
*NL*
back
to
me
.
To
watch
,
teach
,
``
form
''
little
Flora
would
too
evidently
*NL*
be
the
making
of
a
happy
and
useful
life
.
It
had
been
agreed
between
us
*NL*
downstairs
that
after
this
first
occasion
I
should
have
her
as
a
matter
*NL*
of
course
at
night
,
her
small
white
bed
being
already
arranged
,
to
that
*NL*
end
,
in
my
room
.
What
I
had
undertaken
was
the
whole
care
of
her
,
and
*NL*
she
had
remained
,
just
this
last
time
,
with
Mrs.
Grose
only
as
an
effect
*NL*
of
our
consideration
for
my
inevitable
strangeness
and
her
natural
*NL*
timidity
.
In
spite
of
this
timidity
--
which
the
child
herself
,
in
the
*NL*
oddest
way
in
the
world
,
had
been
perfectly
frank
and
brave
about
,
*NL*
allowing
it
,
without
a
sign
of
uncomfortable
consciousness
,
with
the
*NL*
deep
,
sweet
serenity
indeed
of
one
of
Raphael
's
holy
infants
,
to
be
*NL*
discussed
,
to
be
imputed
to
her
,
and
to
determine
us
--
I
feel
quite
sure
*NL*
she
would
presently
like
me
.
It
was
part
of
what
I
already
liked
Mrs.
*NL*
Grose
herself
for
,
the
pleasure
I
could
see
her
feel
in
my
admiration
*NL*
and
wonder
as
I
sat
at
supper
with
four
tall
candles
and
with
my
pupil
,
*NL*
in
a
high
chair
and
a
bib
,
brightly
facing
me
,
between
them
,
over
bread
*NL*
and
milk
.
There
were
naturally
things
that
in
Flora
's
presence
could
*NL*
pass
between
us
only
as
prodigious
and
gratified
looks
,
obscure
and
*NL*
roundabout
allusions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
little
boy
--
does
he
look
like
her
?
Is
he
too
so
very
*NL*
remarkable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
n't
flatter
a
child
.
``
Oh
,
miss
,
MOST
remarkable
.
If
you
think
*NL*
well
of
this
one
!
''
--
and
she
stood
there
with
a
plate
in
her
hand
,
*NL*
beaming
at
our
companion
,
who
looked
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
with
*NL*
placid
heavenly
eyes
that
contained
nothing
to
check
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
if
I
do
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
WILL
be
carried
away
by
the
little
gentleman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
,
I
think
,
is
what
I
came
for
--
to
be
carried
away
.
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
,
however
,
''
I
remember
feeling
the
impulse
to
add
,
``
I
'm
rather
*NL*
easily
carried
away
.
I
was
carried
away
in
London
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
still
see
Mrs.
Grose
's
broad
face
as
she
took
this
in
.
``
In
Harley
*NL*
Street
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Harley
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
miss
,
you
're
not
the
first

and
you
wo
n't
be
the
last

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
no

I
could
laugh
,
``
to
being
the
only
one

other
pupil

at
any
rate

as
I
understand
,
comes
back
tomorrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
tomorrow

Friday

miss
.
He
arrives
,
as
you
did
,
by
the
coach
,
under
*NL*
care
of
the
guard
,
and
is
to
be
met
by
the
same
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
forthwith
expressed
that
the
proper
as
well
as
the
pleasant
and
*NL*
friendly
thing
would
be
therefore
that
on
the
arrival
of
the
public
*NL*
conveyance
I
should
be
in
waiting
for
him
with
his
little
sister
;
an
*NL*
idea
in
which
Mrs.
Grose
concurred
so
heartily
that
I
somehow
took
*NL*
her
manner
as
a
kind
of
comforting
pledge
--
never
falsified
,
thank
*NL*
heaven
!
--
that
we
should
on
every
question
be
quite
at
one
.
Oh
,
she
was
*NL*
glad
I
was
there
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
felt
the
next
day
was
,
I
suppose
,
nothing
that
could
be
fairly
*NL*
called
a
reaction
from
the
cheer
of
my
arrival
;
it
was
probably
at
the
*NL*
most
only
a
slight
oppression
produced
by
a
fuller
measure
of
the
*NL*
scale
,
as
I
walked
round
them
,
gazed
up
at
them
,
took
them
in
,
of
my
new
*NL*
circumstances
.
They
had
,
as
it
were
,
an
extent
and
mass
for
which
I
had
*NL*
not
been
prepared
and
in
the
presence
of
which
I
found
myself
,
freshly
,
*NL*
a
little
scared
as
well
as
a
little
proud
.
Lessons
,
in
this
agitation
,
*NL*
certainly
suffered
some
delay
;
I
reflected
that
my
first
duty
was
,
by
*NL*
the
gentlest
arts
I
could
contrive
,
to
win
the
child
into
the
sense
of
*NL*
knowing
me
.
I
spent
the
day
with
her
out-of-doors
;
I
arranged
with
her
,
*NL*
to
her
great
satisfaction
,
that
it
should
be
she
,
she
only
,
who
might
*NL*
show
me
the
place
.
She
showed
it
step
by
step
and
room
by
room
and
*NL*
secret
by
secret
,
with
droll
,
delightful
,
childish
talk
about
it
and
*NL*
with
the
result
,
in
half
an
hour
,
of
our
becoming
immense
friends
.
*NL*
Young
as
she
was
,
I
was
struck
,
throughout
our
little
tour
,
with
*NL*
her
confidence
and
courage
with
the
way
,
in
empty
chambers
and
dull
*NL*
corridors
,
on
crooked
staircases
that
made
me
pause
and
even
on
the
*NL*
summit
of
an
old
machicolated
square
tower
that
made
me
dizzy
,
her
*NL*
morning
music
,
her
disposition
to
tell
me
so
many
more
things
than
she
*NL*
asked
,
rang
out
and
led
me
on
.
I
have
not
seen
Bly
since
the
day
I
left
*NL*
it
,
and
I
daresay
that
to
my
older
and
more
informed
eyes
it
would
now
*NL*
appear
sufficiently
contracted
.
But
as
my
little
conductress
,
with
her
*NL*
hair
of
gold
and
her
frock
of
blue
,
danced
before
me
round
corners
and
*NL*
pattered
down
passages
,
I
had
the
view
of
a
castle
of
romance
inhabited
*NL*
by
a
rosy
sprite
,
such
a
place
as
would
somehow
,
for
diversion
of
the
*NL*
young
idea
,
take
all
color
out
of
storybooks
and
fairytales
.
Was
n't
it
*NL*
just
a
storybook
over
which
I
had
fallen
adoze
and
adream
?
No
;
it
was
a
*NL*
big
,
ugly
,
antique
,
but
convenient
house
,
embodying
a
few
features
of
*NL*
a
building
still
older
,
half-replaced
and
half-utilized
,
in
which
I
had
*NL*
the
fancy
of
our
being
almost
as
lost
as
a
handful
of
passengers
in
a
*NL*
great
drifting
ship
.
Well
,
I
was
,
strangely
,
at
the
helm
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
came
home
to
me
when
,
two
days
later
,
I
drove
over
with
Flora
to
*NL*
meet
,
as
Mrs.
Grose
said
,
the
little
gentleman
;
and
all
the
more
for
*NL*
an
incident
that
,
presenting
itself
the
second
evening
,
had
deeply
*NL*
disconcerted
me
.
The
first
day
had
been
,
on
the
whole
,
as
I
have
*NL*
expressed
,
reassuring
;
but
I
was
to
see
it
wind
up
in
keen
apprehension
.
*NL*
The
postbag
,
that
evening
--
it
came
late
--
contained
a
letter
for
me
,
*NL*
which
,
however
,
in
the
hand
of
my
employer
,
I
found
to
be
composed
but
*NL*
of
a
few
words
enclosing
another
,
addressed
to
himself
,
with
a
seal
*NL*
still
unbroken
.
``
This
,
I
recognize
,
is
from
the
headmaster
,
and
the
*NL*
headmaster
's
an
awful
bore
.
Read
him
,
please
;
deal
with
him
;
but
mind
*NL*
you
do
n't
report
.
Not
a
word
.
I
'm
off
!
''
I
broke
the
seal
with
a
great
*NL*
effort
--
so
great
a
one
that
I
was
a
long
time
coming
to
it
;
took
the
*NL*
unopened
missive
at
last
up
to
my
room
and
only
attacked
it
just
before
*NL*
going
to
bed
.
I
had
better
have
let
it
wait
till
morning
,
for
it
gave
me
*NL*
a
second
sleepless
night
.
With
no
counsel
to
take
,
the
next
day
,
I
*NL*
was
full
of
distress
;
and
it
finally
got
so
the
better
of
me
that
I
*NL*
determined
to
open
myself
at
least
to
Mrs.
Grose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
mean
?
The
child
's
dismissed
his
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
me
a
look
that
I
remarked
at
the
moment
;
then
,
visibly
,
with
a
*NL*
quick
blankness
,
seemed
to
try
to
take
it
back
.
``
But
are
n't
they
all
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sent
home
--
yes
.
But
only
for
the
holidays
.
Miles
may
never
go
back
at
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Consciously
,
under
my
attention
,
she
reddened
.
``
They
wo
n't
take
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
absolutely
decline
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
she
raised
her
eyes
,
which
she
had
turned
from
me
;
I
saw
them
*NL*
fill
with
good
tears
.
``
What
has
he
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
hesitated
;
then
I
judged
best
simply
to
hand
her
my
letter
--
which
,
*NL*
however
,
had
the
effect
of
making
her
,
without
taking
it
,
simply
put
her
*NL*
hands
behind
her
.
She
shook
her
head
sadly
.
``
Such
things
are
not
for
me
,
*NL*
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
counselor
could
n't
read
!
I
winced
at
my
mistake
,
which
I
attenuated
*NL*
as
I
could
,
and
opened
my
letter
again
to
repeat
it
to
her
;
then
,
*NL*
faltering
in
the
act
and
folding
it
up
once
more
,
I
put
it
back
in
my
*NL*
pocket
.
``
Is
he
really
BAD
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
were
still
in
her
eyes
.
``
Do
the
gentlemen
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
go
into
no
particulars
.
They
simply
express
their
regret
that
it
*NL*
should
be
impossible
to
keep
him
.
That
can
have
only
one
meaning
.
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
listened
with
dumb
emotion
;
she
forbore
to
ask
me
what
*NL*
this
meaning
might
be
;
so
that
,
presently
,
to
put
the
thing
with
some
*NL*
coherence
and
with
the
mere
aid
of
her
presence
to
my
own
mind
,
I
went
*NL*
on
:
``
That
he
's
an
injury
to
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
,
with
one
of
the
quick
turns
of
simple
folk
,
she
suddenly
flamed
*NL*
up
.
``
Master
Miles
!
HIM
an
injury
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
such
a
flood
of
good
faith
in
it
that
,
though
I
had
not
yet
*NL*
seen
the
child
,
my
very
fears
made
me
jump
to
the
absurdity
of
the
idea
.
*NL*
I
found
myself
,
to
meet
my
friend
the
better
,
offering
it
,
on
the
spot
,
*NL*
sarcastically
.
``
To
his
poor
little
innocent
mates
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
dreadful
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Grose
,
``
to
say
such
cruel
things
!
Why
,
*NL*
he
's
scarce
ten
years
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
it
would
be
incredible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
evidently
grateful
for
such
a
profession
.
``
See
him
,
miss
,
first
.
*NL*
THEN
believe
it
!
''
I
felt
forthwith
a
new
impatience
to
see
him
;
it
was
*NL*
the
beginning
of
a
curiosity
that
,
for
all
the
next
hours
,
was
to
deepen
*NL*
almost
to
pain
.
Mrs.
Grose
was
aware
,
I
could
judge
,
of
what
she
had
*NL*
produced
in
me
,
and
she
followed
it
up
with
assurance
.
``
You
might
as
*NL*
well
believe
it
of
the
little
lady
.
Bless
her
,
''
she
added
the
next
*NL*
moment
--
``
LOOK
at
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
and
saw
that
Flora
,
whom
,
ten
minutes
before
,
I
had
established
*NL*
in
the
schoolroom
with
a
sheet
of
white
paper
,
a
pencil
,
and
a
copy
of
*NL*
nice
``
round
o
's
,
''
now
presented
herself
to
view
at
the
open
door
.
*NL*
She
expressed
in
her
little
way
an
extraordinary
detachment
from
*NL*
disagreeable
duties
,
looking
to
me
,
however
,
with
a
great
childish
*NL*
light
that
seemed
to
offer
it
as
a
mere
result
of
the
affection
she
had
*NL*
conceived
for
my
person
,
which
had
rendered
necessary
that
she
should
*NL*
follow
me
.
I
needed
nothing
more
than
this
to
feel
the
full
force
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
's
comparison
,
and
,
catching
my
pupil
in
my
arms
,
covered
her
*NL*
with
kisses
in
which
there
was
a
sob
of
atonement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nonetheless
,
the
rest
of
the
day
I
watched
for
further
occasion
to
*NL*
approach
my
colleague
,
especially
as
,
toward
evening
,
I
began
to
fancy
*NL*
she
rather
sought
to
avoid
me
.
I
overtook
her
,
I
remember
,
on
the
*NL*
staircase
;
we
went
down
together
,
and
at
the
bottom
I
detained
her
,
*NL*
holding
her
there
with
a
hand
on
her
arm
.
``
I
take
what
you
said
to
me
at
*NL*
noon
as
a
declaration
that
YOU
'VE
never
known
him
to
be
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
threw
back
her
head
;
she
had
clearly
,
by
this
time
,
and
very
*NL*
honestly
,
adopted
an
attitude
.
``
Oh
,
never
known
him
--
I
do
n't
pretend
*NL*
THAT
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
upset
again
.
``
Then
you
HAVE
known
him
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
indeed
,
miss
,
thank
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
reflection
I
accepted
this
.
``
You
mean
that
a
boy
who
never
is
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
no
boy
for
ME
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
held
her
tighter
.
``
You
like
them
with
the
spirit
to
be
naughty
?
''
Then
,
*NL*
keeping
pace
with
her
answer
,
``
So
do
I
!
''
I
eagerly
brought
out
.
``
But
not
*NL*
to
the
degree
to
contaminate
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
contaminate
?
''
--
my
big
word
left
her
at
a
loss
.
I
explained
it
.
``
To
*NL*
corrupt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stared
,
taking
my
meaning
in
;
but
it
produced
in
her
an
odd
laugh
.
*NL*
``
Are
you
afraid
he
'll
corrupt
YOU
?
''
She
put
the
question
with
such
a
*NL*
fine
bold
humor
that
,
with
a
laugh
,
a
little
silly
doubtless
,
to
match
*NL*
her
own
,
I
gave
way
for
the
time
to
the
apprehension
of
ridicule
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
next
day
,
as
the
hour
for
my
drive
approached
,
I
cropped
up
in
*NL*
another
place
.
``
What
was
the
lady
who
was
here
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
governess
?
She
was
also
young
and
pretty
--
almost
as
young
and
*NL*
almost
as
pretty
,
miss
,
even
as
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
,
I
hope
her
youth
and
her
beauty
helped
her
!
''
I
recollect
*NL*
throwing
off
.
``
He
seems
to
like
us
young
and
pretty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
DID
,
''
Mrs.
Grose
assented
:
``
it
was
the
way
he
liked
everyone
!
''
*NL*
She
had
no
sooner
spoken
indeed
than
she
caught
herself
up
.
``
I
mean
*NL*
that
's
HIS
way
--
the
master
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
struck
.
``
But
of
whom
did
you
speak
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
blank
,
but
she
colored
.
``
Why
,
of
HIM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
the
master
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
who
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
so
obviously
no
one
else
that
the
next
moment
I
had
lost
my
*NL*
impression
of
her
having
accidentally
said
more
than
she
meant
;
and
I
*NL*
merely
asked
what
I
wanted
to
know
.
``
Did
SHE
see
anything
in
the
boy
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
n't
right
?
She
never
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
scruple
,
but
I
overcame
it
.
``
Was
she
careful
--
particular
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
appeared
to
try
to
be
conscientious
.
``
About
some
*NL*
things
--
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
about
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
considered
.
``
Well
,
miss
--
she
's
gone
.
I
wo
n't
tell
tales
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
understand
your
feeling
,
''
I
hastened
to
reply
;
but
I
thought
*NL*
it
,
after
an
instant
,
not
opposed
to
this
concession
to
pursue
:
``
Did
she
*NL*
die
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
she
went
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
there
was
in
this
brevity
of
Mrs.
Grose
's
that
struck
*NL*
me
as
ambiguous
.
``
Went
off
to
die
?
''
Mrs.
Grose
looked
straight
out
of
*NL*
the
window
,
but
I
felt
that
,
hypothetically
,
I
had
a
right
to
know
what
*NL*
young
persons
engaged
for
Bly
were
expected
to
do
.
``
She
was
taken
ill
,
*NL*
you
mean
,
and
went
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
not
taken
ill
,
so
far
as
appeared
,
in
this
house
.
She
left
it
,
*NL*
at
the
end
of
the
year
,
to
go
home
,
as
she
said
,
for
a
short
holiday
,
*NL*
to
which
the
time
she
had
put
in
had
certainly
given
her
a
right
.
We
*NL*
had
then
a
young
woman
--
a
nursemaid
who
had
stayed
on
and
who
was
a
good
*NL*
girl
and
clever
;
and
SHE
took
the
children
altogether
for
the
interval
.
*NL*
But
our
young
lady
never
came
back
,
and
at
the
very
moment
I
was
*NL*
expecting
her
I
heard
from
the
master
that
she
was
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
this
over
.
``
But
of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
told
me
!
But
please
,
miss
,
''
said
Mrs.
Grose
,
``
I
must
get
to
my
*NL*
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Her
thus
turning
her
back
on
me
was
fortunately
not
,
for
my
just
*NL*
preoccupations
,
a
snub
that
could
check
the
growth
of
our
mutual
esteem
.
*NL*
We
met
,
after
I
had
brought
home
little
Miles
,
more
intimately
than
ever
*NL*
on
the
ground
of
my
stupefaction
,
my
general
emotion
:
so
monstrous
was
I
*NL*
then
ready
to
pronounce
it
that
such
a
child
as
had
now
been
revealed
to
*NL*
me
should
be
under
an
interdict
.
I
was
a
little
late
on
the
scene
,
and
*NL*
I
felt
,
as
he
stood
wistfully
looking
out
for
me
before
the
door
of
the
*NL*
inn
at
which
the
coach
had
put
him
down
,
that
I
had
seen
him
,
on
the
*NL*
instant
,
without
and
within
,
in
the
great
glow
of
freshness
,
the
same
*NL*
positive
fragrance
of
purity
,
in
which
I
had
,
from
the
first
moment
,
*NL*
seen
his
little
sister
.
He
was
incredibly
beautiful
,
and
Mrs.
Grose
had
*NL*
put
her
finger
on
it
:
everything
but
a
sort
of
passion
of
tenderness
for
*NL*
him
was
swept
away
by
his
presence
.
What
I
then
and
there
took
him
to
*NL*
my
heart
for
was
something
divine
that
I
have
never
found
to
the
same
*NL*
degree
in
any
child
--
his
indescribable
little
air
of
knowing
nothing
in
*NL*
the
world
but
love
.
It
would
have
been
impossible
to
carry
a
bad
name
*NL*
with
a
greater
sweetness
of
innocence
,
and
by
the
time
I
had
got
back
to
*NL*
Bly
with
him
I
remained
merely
bewildered
--
so
far
,
that
is
,
as
I
was
not
*NL*
outraged
--
by
the
sense
of
the
horrible
letter
locked
up
in
my
room
,
in
*NL*
a
drawer
.
As
soon
as
I
could
compass
a
private
word
with
Mrs.
Grose
I
*NL*
declared
to
her
that
it
was
grotesque
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
promptly
understood
me
.
``
You
mean
the
cruel
charge
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
live
an
instant
.
My
dear
woman
,
LOOK
at
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
at
my
pretention
to
have
discovered
his
charm
.
``
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
miss
,
I
do
nothing
else
!
What
will
you
say
,
then
?
''
she
immediately
*NL*
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
answer
to
the
letter
?
''
I
had
made
up
my
mind
.
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
his
uncle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
incisive
.
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
the
boy
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
wonderful
.
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
with
her
apron
a
great
wipe
to
her
mouth
.
``
Then
I
'll
stand
by
*NL*
you
.
We
'll
see
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
see
it
out
!
''
I
ardently
echoed
,
giving
her
my
hand
to
make
it
a
*NL*
vow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
me
there
a
moment
,
then
whisked
up
her
apron
again
with
her
*NL*
detached
hand
.
``
Would
you
mind
,
miss
,
if
I
used
the
freedom
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
kiss
me
?
No
!
''
I
took
the
good
creature
in
my
arms
and
,
after
we
had
*NL*
embraced
like
sisters
,
felt
still
more
fortified
and
indignant
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
at
all
events
,
was
for
the
time
:
a
time
so
full
that
,
as
I
recall
*NL*
the
way
it
went
,
it
reminds
me
of
all
the
art
I
now
need
to
make
it
a
*NL*
little
distinct
.
What
I
look
back
at
with
amazement
is
the
situation
I
*NL*
accepted
.
I
had
undertaken
,
with
my
companion
,
to
see
it
out
,
and
I
was
*NL*
under
a
charm
,
apparently
,
that
could
smooth
away
the
extent
and
the
*NL*
far
and
difficult
connections
of
such
an
effort
.
I
was
lifted
aloft
on
a
*NL*
great
wave
of
infatuation
and
pity
.
I
found
it
simple
,
in
my
ignorance
,
*NL*
my
confusion
,
and
perhaps
my
conceit
,
to
assume
that
I
could
deal
with
*NL*
a
boy
whose
education
for
the
world
was
all
on
the
point
of
beginning
.
*NL*
I
am
unable
even
to
remember
at
this
day
what
proposal
I
framed
for
the
*NL*
end
of
his
holidays
and
the
resumption
of
his
studies
.
Lessons
with
me
,
*NL*
indeed
,
that
charming
summer
,
we
all
had
a
theory
that
he
was
to
have
;
*NL*
but
I
now
feel
that
,
for
weeks
,
the
lessons
must
have
been
rather
my
*NL*
own
.
I
learned
something
--
at
first
,
certainly
--
that
had
not
been
one
*NL*
of
the
teachings
of
my
small
,
smothered
life
;
learned
to
be
amused
,
and
*NL*
even
amusing
,
and
not
to
think
for
the
morrow
.
It
was
the
first
time
,
in
*NL*
a
manner
,
that
I
had
known
space
and
air
and
freedom
,
all
the
music
*NL*
of
summer
and
all
the
mystery
of
nature
.
And
then
there
was
*NL*
consideration
--
and
consideration
was
sweet
.
Oh
,
it
was
a
trap
--
not
*NL*
designed
,
but
deep
--
to
my
imagination
,
to
my
delicacy
,
perhaps
to
my
*NL*
vanity
;
to
whatever
,
in
me
,
was
most
excitable
.
The
best
way
to
picture
*NL*
it
all
is
to
say
that
I
was
off
my
guard
.
They
gave
me
so
little
*NL*
trouble
--
they
were
of
a
gentleness
so
extraordinary
.
I
used
to
*NL*
speculate
--
but
even
this
with
a
dim
disconnectedness
--
as
to
how
the
*NL*
rough
future
-LRB-
for
all
futures
are
rough
!
-RRB-
would
handle
them
and
might
*NL*
bruise
them
.
They
had
the
bloom
of
health
and
happiness
;
and
yet
,
as
*NL*
if
I
had
been
in
charge
of
a
pair
of
little
grandees
,
of
princes
of
the
*NL*
blood
,
for
whom
everything
,
to
be
right
,
would
have
to
be
enclosed
and
*NL*
protected
,
the
only
form
that
,
in
my
fancy
,
the
afteryears
could
take
*NL*
for
them
was
that
of
a
romantic
,
a
really
royal
extension
of
the
garden
*NL*
and
the
park
.
It
may
be
,
of
course
,
above
all
,
that
what
suddenly
broke
*NL*
into
this
gives
the
previous
time
a
charm
of
stillness
--
that
hush
in
*NL*
which
something
gathers
or
crouches
.
The
change
was
actually
like
the
*NL*
spring
of
a
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
weeks
the
days
were
long
;
they
often
,
at
their
finest
,
*NL*
gave
me
what
I
used
to
call
my
own
hour
,
the
hour
when
,
for
my
pupils
,
*NL*
teatime
and
bedtime
having
come
and
gone
,
I
had
,
before
my
final
*NL*
retirement
,
a
small
interval
alone
.
Much
as
I
liked
my
companions
,
this
*NL*
hour
was
the
thing
in
the
day
I
liked
most
;
and
I
liked
it
best
of
all
*NL*
when
,
as
the
light
faded
--
or
rather
,
I
should
say
,
the
day
lingered
and
*NL*
the
last
calls
of
the
last
birds
sounded
,
in
a
flushed
sky
,
from
the
*NL*
old
trees
--
I
could
take
a
turn
into
the
grounds
and
enjoy
,
almost
with
*NL*
a
sense
of
property
that
amused
and
flattered
me
,
the
beauty
and
dignity
*NL*
of
the
place
.
It
was
a
pleasure
at
these
moments
to
feel
myself
*NL*
tranquil
and
justified
;
doubtless
,
perhaps
,
also
to
reflect
that
by
my
*NL*
discretion
,
my
quiet
good
sense
and
general
high
propriety
,
I
was
giving
*NL*
pleasure
--
if
he
ever
thought
of
it
!
--
to
the
person
to
whose
pressure
*NL*
I
had
responded
.
What
I
was
doing
was
what
he
had
earnestly
hoped
and
*NL*
directly
asked
of
me
,
and
that
I
COULD
,
after
all
,
do
it
proved
even
a
*NL*
greater
joy
than
I
had
expected
.
I
daresay
I
fancied
myself
,
in
short
,
*NL*
a
remarkable
young
woman
and
took
comfort
in
the
faith
that
this
would
*NL*
more
publicly
appear
.
Well
,
I
needed
to
be
remarkable
to
offer
a
front
*NL*
to
the
remarkable
things
that
presently
gave
their
first
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
plump
,
one
afternoon
,
in
the
middle
of
my
very
hour
:
the
children
*NL*
were
tucked
away
,
and
I
had
come
out
for
my
stroll
.
One
of
the
thoughts
*NL*
that
,
as
I
do
n't
in
the
least
shrink
now
from
noting
,
used
to
be
with
me
*NL*
in
these
wanderings
was
that
it
would
be
as
charming
as
a
charming
story
*NL*
suddenly
to
meet
someone
.
Someone
would
appear
there
at
the
turn
of
a
*NL*
path
and
would
stand
before
me
and
smile
and
approve
.
I
did
n't
ask
more
*NL*
than
that
--
I
only
asked
that
he
should
KNOW
;
and
the
only
way
to
be
sure
*NL*
he
knew
would
be
to
see
it
,
and
the
kind
light
of
it
,
in
his
handsome
*NL*
face
.
That
was
exactly
present
to
me
--
by
which
I
mean
the
face
*NL*
was
--
when
,
on
the
first
of
these
occasions
,
at
the
end
of
a
long
June
*NL*
day
,
I
stopped
short
on
emerging
from
one
of
the
plantations
and
coming
*NL*
into
view
of
the
house
.
What
arrested
me
on
the
spot
--
and
with
a
shock
*NL*
much
greater
than
any
vision
had
allowed
for
--
was
the
sense
that
my
*NL*
imagination
had
,
in
a
flash
,
turned
real
.
He
did
stand
there
!
--
but
high
*NL*
up
,
beyond
the
lawn
and
at
the
very
top
of
the
tower
to
which
,
on
that
*NL*
first
morning
,
little
Flora
had
conducted
me
.
This
tower
was
one
of
*NL*
a
pair
--
square
,
incongruous
,
crenelated
structures
--
that
were
*NL*
distinguished
,
for
some
reason
,
though
I
could
see
little
difference
,
*NL*
as
the
new
and
the
old
.
They
flanked
opposite
ends
of
the
house
and
were
*NL*
probably
architectural
absurdities
,
redeemed
in
a
measure
indeed
by
*NL*
not
being
wholly
disengaged
nor
of
a
height
too
pretentious
,
dating
,
in
*NL*
their
gingerbread
antiquity
,
from
a
romantic
revival
that
was
already
a
*NL*
respectable
past
.
I
admired
them
,
had
fancies
about
them
,
for
we
could
*NL*
all
profit
in
a
degree
,
especially
when
they
loomed
through
the
dusk
,
*NL*
by
the
grandeur
of
their
actual
battlements
;
yet
it
was
not
at
such
an
*NL*
elevation
that
the
figure
I
had
so
often
invoked
seemed
most
in
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
produced
in
me
,
this
figure
,
in
the
clear
twilight
,
I
remember
,
two
*NL*
distinct
gasps
of
emotion
,
which
were
,
sharply
,
the
shock
of
my
first
*NL*
and
that
of
my
second
surprise
.
My
second
was
a
violent
perception
of
*NL*
the
mistake
of
my
first
:
the
man
who
met
my
eyes
was
not
the
person
*NL*
I
had
precipitately
supposed
.
There
came
to
me
thus
a
bewilderment
of
*NL*
vision
of
which
,
after
these
years
,
there
is
no
living
view
that
I
can
*NL*
hope
to
give
.
An
unknown
man
in
a
lonely
place
is
a
permitted
object
*NL*
of
fear
to
a
young
woman
privately
bred
;
and
the
figure
that
faced
me
*NL*
was
--
a
few
more
seconds
assured
me
--
as
little
anyone
else
I
knew
as
*NL*
it
was
the
image
that
had
been
in
my
mind
.
I
had
not
seen
it
in
*NL*
Harley
Street
--
I
had
not
seen
it
anywhere
.
The
place
,
moreover
,
in
the
*NL*
strangest
way
in
the
world
,
had
,
on
the
instant
,
and
by
the
very
fact
of
*NL*
its
appearance
,
become
a
solitude
.
To
me
at
least
,
making
my
statement
*NL*
here
with
a
deliberation
with
which
I
have
never
made
it
,
the
whole
*NL*
feeling
of
the
moment
returns
.
It
was
as
if
,
while
I
took
in
--
what
I
did
*NL*
take
in
--
all
the
rest
of
the
scene
had
been
stricken
with
death
.
I
can
*NL*
hear
again
,
as
I
write
,
the
intense
hush
in
which
the
sounds
of
evening
*NL*
dropped
.
The
rooks
stopped
cawing
in
the
golden
sky
,
and
the
friendly
*NL*
hour
lost
,
for
the
minute
,
all
its
voice
.
But
there
was
no
other
change
*NL*
in
nature
,
unless
indeed
it
were
a
change
that
I
saw
with
a
stranger
*NL*
sharpness
.
The
gold
was
still
in
the
sky
,
the
clearness
in
the
air
,
*NL*
and
the
man
who
looked
at
me
over
the
battlements
was
as
definite
as
a
*NL*
picture
in
a
frame
.
That
's
how
I
thought
,
with
extraordinary
quickness
,
*NL*
of
each
person
that
he
might
have
been
and
that
he
was
not
.
We
were
*NL*
confronted
across
our
distance
quite
long
enough
for
me
to
ask
myself
*NL*
with
intensity
who
then
he
was
and
to
feel
,
as
an
effect
of
my
inability
*NL*
to
say
,
a
wonder
that
in
a
few
instants
more
became
intense
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
question
,
or
one
of
these
,
is
,
afterward
,
I
know
,
with
regard
*NL*
to
certain
matters
,
the
question
of
how
long
they
have
lasted
.
Well
,
*NL*
this
matter
of
mine
,
think
what
you
will
of
it
,
lasted
while
I
caught
at
*NL*
a
dozen
possibilities
,
none
of
which
made
a
difference
for
the
better
,
*NL*
that
I
could
see
,
in
there
having
been
in
the
house
--
and
for
how
long
,
*NL*
above
all
?
--
a
person
of
whom
I
was
in
ignorance
.
It
lasted
while
I
*NL*
just
bridled
a
little
with
the
sense
that
my
office
demanded
that
there
*NL*
should
be
no
such
ignorance
and
no
such
person
.
It
lasted
while
this
*NL*
visitant
,
at
all
events
--
and
there
was
a
touch
of
the
strange
freedom
,
*NL*
as
I
remember
,
in
the
sign
of
familiarity
of
his
wearing
no
hat
--
seemed
*NL*
to
fix
me
,
from
his
position
,
with
just
the
question
,
just
the
scrutiny
*NL*
through
the
fading
light
,
that
his
own
presence
provoked
.
We
were
too
*NL*
far
apart
to
call
to
each
other
,
but
there
was
a
moment
at
which
,
at
*NL*
shorter
range
,
some
challenge
between
us
,
breaking
the
hush
,
would
have
*NL*
been
the
right
result
of
our
straight
mutual
stare
.
He
was
in
one
of
the
*NL*
angles
,
the
one
away
from
the
house
,
very
erect
,
as
it
struck
me
,
and
*NL*
with
both
hands
on
the
ledge
.
So
I
saw
him
as
I
see
the
letters
I
*NL*
form
on
this
page
;
then
,
exactly
,
after
a
minute
,
as
if
to
add
to
the
*NL*
spectacle
,
he
slowly
changed
his
place
--
passed
,
looking
at
me
hard
*NL*
all
the
while
,
to
the
opposite
corner
of
the
platform
.
Yes
,
I
had
the
*NL*
sharpest
sense
that
during
this
transit
he
never
took
his
eyes
from
me
,
*NL*
and
I
can
see
at
this
moment
the
way
his
hand
,
as
he
went
,
passed
from
*NL*
one
of
the
crenelations
to
the
next
.
He
stopped
at
the
other
corner
,
but
*NL*
less
long
,
and
even
as
he
turned
away
still
markedly
fixed
me
.
He
turned
*NL*
away
;
that
was
all
I
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
It
was
not
that
I
did
n't
wait
,
on
this
occasion
,
for
more
,
for
I
was
*NL*
rooted
as
deeply
as
I
was
shaken
.
Was
there
a
``
secret
''
at
Bly
--
a
mystery
*NL*
of
Udolpho
or
an
insane
,
an
unmentionable
relative
kept
in
unsuspected
*NL*
confinement
?
I
ca
n't
say
how
long
I
turned
it
over
,
or
how
long
,
in
*NL*
a
confusion
of
curiosity
and
dread
,
I
remained
where
I
had
had
my
*NL*
collision
;
I
only
recall
that
when
I
re-entered
the
house
darkness
had
*NL*
quite
closed
in
.
Agitation
,
in
the
interval
,
certainly
had
held
me
and
*NL*
driven
me
,
for
I
must
,
in
circling
about
the
place
,
have
walked
three
*NL*
miles
;
but
I
was
to
be
,
later
on
,
so
much
more
overwhelmed
that
this
*NL*
mere
dawn
of
alarm
was
a
comparatively
human
chill
.
The
most
singular
*NL*
part
of
it
,
in
fact
--
singular
as
the
rest
had
been
--
was
the
part
I
*NL*
became
,
in
the
hall
,
aware
of
in
meeting
Mrs.
Grose
.
This
picture
comes
*NL*
back
to
me
in
the
general
train
--
the
impression
,
as
I
received
it
on
my
*NL*
return
,
of
the
wide
white
panelled
space
,
bright
in
the
lamplight
and
*NL*
with
its
portraits
and
red
carpet
,
and
of
the
good
surprised
look
of
*NL*
my
friend
,
which
immediately
told
me
she
had
missed
me
.
It
came
to
*NL*
me
straightway
,
under
her
contact
,
that
,
with
plain
heartiness
,
mere
*NL*
relieved
anxiety
at
my
appearance
,
she
knew
nothing
whatever
that
could
*NL*
bear
upon
the
incident
I
had
there
ready
for
her
.
I
had
not
suspected
*NL*
in
advance
that
her
comfortable
face
would
pull
me
up
,
and
I
somehow
*NL*
measured
the
importance
of
what
I
had
seen
by
my
thus
finding
myself
*NL*
hesitate
to
mention
it
.
Scarce
anything
in
the
whole
history
seems
to
*NL*
me
so
odd
as
this
fact
that
my
real
beginning
of
fear
was
one
,
as
I
*NL*
may
say
,
with
the
instinct
of
sparing
my
companion
.
On
the
spot
,
*NL*
accordingly
,
in
the
pleasant
hall
and
with
her
eyes
on
me
,
I
,
for
*NL*
a
reason
that
I
could
n't
then
have
phrased
,
achieved
an
inward
*NL*
resolution
--
offered
a
vague
pretext
for
my
lateness
and
,
with
the
plea
*NL*
of
the
beauty
of
the
night
and
of
the
heavy
dew
and
wet
feet
,
went
as
*NL*
soon
as
possible
to
my
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
it
was
another
affair
;
here
,
for
many
days
after
,
it
was
a
queer
*NL*
affair
enough
.
There
were
hours
,
from
day
to
day
--
or
at
least
there
were
*NL*
moments
,
snatched
even
from
clear
duties
--
when
I
had
to
shut
myself
up
*NL*
to
think
.
It
was
not
so
much
yet
that
I
was
more
nervous
than
I
could
*NL*
bear
to
be
as
that
I
was
remarkably
afraid
of
becoming
so
;
for
the
truth
*NL*
I
had
now
to
turn
over
was
,
simply
and
clearly
,
the
truth
that
I
could
*NL*
arrive
at
no
account
whatever
of
the
visitor
with
whom
I
had
been
so
*NL*
inexplicably
and
yet
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
so
intimately
concerned
.
It
*NL*
took
little
time
to
see
that
I
could
sound
without
forms
of
inquiry
*NL*
and
without
exciting
remark
any
domestic
complications
.
The
shock
I
had
*NL*
suffered
must
have
sharpened
all
my
senses
;
I
felt
sure
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
three
days
and
as
the
result
of
mere
closer
attention
,
that
I
had
not
*NL*
been
practiced
upon
by
the
servants
nor
made
the
object
of
any
``
game
.
''
*NL*
Of
whatever
it
was
that
I
knew
,
nothing
was
known
around
me
.
There
was
*NL*
but
one
sane
inference
:
someone
had
taken
a
liberty
rather
gross
.
That
*NL*
was
what
,
repeatedly
,
I
dipped
into
my
room
and
locked
the
door
to
say
*NL*
to
myself
.
We
had
been
,
collectively
,
subject
to
an
intrusion
;
some
*NL*
unscrupulous
traveler
,
curious
in
old
houses
,
had
made
his
way
in
*NL*
unobserved
,
enjoyed
the
prospect
from
the
best
point
of
view
,
and
then
*NL*
stolen
out
as
he
came
.
If
he
had
given
me
such
a
bold
hard
stare
,
that
*NL*
was
but
a
part
of
his
indiscretion
.
The
good
thing
,
after
all
,
was
that
*NL*
we
should
surely
see
no
more
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
so
good
a
thing
,
I
admit
,
as
not
to
leave
me
to
judge
that
*NL*
what
,
essentially
,
made
nothing
else
much
signify
was
simply
my
charming
*NL*
work
.
My
charming
work
was
just
my
life
with
Miles
and
Flora
,
and
*NL*
through
nothing
could
I
so
like
it
as
through
feeling
that
I
could
throw
*NL*
myself
into
it
in
trouble
.
The
attraction
of
my
small
charges
was
a
*NL*
constant
joy
,
leading
me
to
wonder
afresh
at
the
vanity
of
my
original
*NL*
fears
,
the
distaste
I
had
begun
by
entertaining
for
the
probable
gray
*NL*
prose
of
my
office
.
There
was
to
be
no
gray
prose
,
it
appeared
,
and
no
*NL*
long
grind
;
so
how
could
work
not
be
charming
that
presented
itself
as
*NL*
daily
beauty
?
It
was
all
the
romance
of
the
nursery
and
the
poetry
of
*NL*
the
schoolroom
.
I
do
n't
mean
by
this
,
of
course
,
that
we
studied
*NL*
only
fiction
and
verse
;
I
mean
I
can
express
no
otherwise
the
sort
*NL*
of
interest
my
companions
inspired
.
How
can
I
describe
that
except
by
*NL*
saying
that
instead
of
growing
used
to
them
--
and
it
's
a
marvel
for
a
*NL*
governess
:
I
call
the
sisterhood
to
witness
!
--
I
made
constant
fresh
*NL*
discoveries
.
There
was
one
direction
,
assuredly
,
in
which
these
*NL*
discoveries
stopped
:
deep
obscurity
continued
to
cover
the
region
of
the
*NL*
boy
's
conduct
at
school
.
It
had
been
promptly
given
me
,
I
have
noted
,
*NL*
to
face
that
mystery
without
a
pang
.
Perhaps
even
it
would
be
nearer
the
*NL*
truth
to
say
that
--
without
a
word
--
he
himself
had
cleared
it
up
.
He
had
*NL*
made
the
whole
charge
absurd
.
My
conclusion
bloomed
there
with
the
*NL*
real
rose
flush
of
his
innocence
:
he
was
only
too
fine
and
fair
for
the
*NL*
little
horrid
,
unclean
school
world
,
and
he
had
paid
a
price
for
it
.
I
*NL*
reflected
acutely
that
the
sense
of
such
differences
,
such
superiorities
*NL*
of
quality
,
always
,
on
the
part
of
the
majority
--
which
could
include
*NL*
even
stupid
,
sordid
headmasters
--
turn
infallibly
to
the
vindictive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
children
had
a
gentleness
-LRB-
it
was
their
only
fault
,
and
it
*NL*
never
made
Miles
a
muff
-RRB-
that
kept
them
--
how
shall
I
express
it
?
--
almost
*NL*
impersonal
and
certainly
quite
unpunishable
.
They
were
like
the
cherubs
*NL*
of
the
anecdote
,
who
had
--
morally
,
at
any
rate
--
nothing
to
whack
!
I
*NL*
remember
feeling
with
Miles
in
especial
as
if
he
had
had
,
as
it
were
,
no
*NL*
history
.
We
expect
of
a
small
child
a
scant
one
,
but
there
was
in
*NL*
this
beautiful
little
boy
something
extraordinarily
sensitive
,
yet
*NL*
extraordinarily
happy
,
that
,
more
than
in
any
creature
of
his
age
I
have
*NL*
seen
,
struck
me
as
beginning
anew
each
day
.
He
had
never
for
a
second
*NL*
suffered
.
I
took
this
as
a
direct
disproof
of
his
having
really
been
*NL*
chastised
.
If
he
had
been
wicked
he
would
have
``
caught
''
it
,
and
I
should
*NL*
have
caught
it
by
the
rebound
--
I
should
have
found
the
trace
.
I
found
*NL*
nothing
at
all
,
and
he
was
therefore
an
angel
.
He
never
spoke
of
his
*NL*
school
,
never
mentioned
a
comrade
or
a
master
;
and
I
,
for
my
part
,
was
*NL*
quite
too
much
disgusted
to
allude
to
them
.
Of
course
I
was
under
the
*NL*
spell
,
and
the
wonderful
part
is
that
,
even
at
the
time
,
I
perfectly
*NL*
knew
I
was
.
But
I
gave
myself
up
to
it
;
it
was
an
antidote
to
any
*NL*
pain
,
and
I
had
more
pains
than
one
.
I
was
in
receipt
in
these
days
of
*NL*
disturbing
letters
from
home
,
where
things
were
not
going
well
.
But
with
*NL*
my
children
,
what
things
in
the
world
mattered
?
That
was
the
question
*NL*
I
used
to
put
to
my
scrappy
retirements
.
I
was
dazzled
by
their
*NL*
loveliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
Sunday
--
to
get
on
--
when
it
rained
with
such
force
and
for
so
*NL*
many
hours
that
there
could
be
no
procession
to
church
;
in
consequence
*NL*
of
which
,
as
the
day
declined
,
I
had
arranged
with
Mrs.
Grose
that
,
*NL*
should
the
evening
show
improvement
,
we
would
attend
together
the
late
*NL*
service
.
The
rain
happily
stopped
,
and
I
prepared
for
our
walk
,
which
,
*NL*
through
the
park
and
by
the
good
road
to
the
village
,
would
be
a
matter
*NL*
of
twenty
minutes
.
Coming
downstairs
to
meet
my
colleague
in
the
hall
,
*NL*
I
remembered
a
pair
of
gloves
that
had
required
three
stitches
and
that
*NL*
had
received
them
--
with
a
publicity
perhaps
not
edifying
--
while
I
sat
*NL*
with
the
children
at
their
tea
,
served
on
Sundays
,
by
exception
,
in
that
*NL*
cold
,
clean
temple
of
mahogany
and
brass
,
the
``
grown-up
''
dining
room
.
*NL*
The
gloves
had
been
dropped
there
,
and
I
turned
in
to
recover
them
.
*NL*
The
day
was
gray
enough
,
but
the
afternoon
light
still
lingered
,
and
it
*NL*
enabled
me
,
on
crossing
the
threshold
,
not
only
to
recognize
,
on
a
chair
*NL*
near
the
wide
window
,
then
closed
,
the
articles
I
wanted
,
but
to
become
*NL*
aware
of
a
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
window
and
looking
straight
*NL*
in
.
One
step
into
the
room
had
sufficed
;
my
vision
was
instantaneous
;
*NL*
it
was
all
there
.
The
person
looking
straight
in
was
the
person
who
had
*NL*
already
appeared
to
me
.
He
appeared
thus
again
with
I
wo
n't
say
*NL*
greater
distinctness
,
for
that
was
impossible
,
but
with
a
nearness
that
*NL*
represented
a
forward
stride
in
our
intercourse
and
made
me
,
as
I
met
*NL*
him
,
catch
my
breath
and
turn
cold
.
He
was
the
same
--
he
was
the
same
,
*NL*
and
seen
,
this
time
,
as
he
had
been
seen
before
,
from
the
waist
up
,
the
*NL*
window
,
though
the
dining
room
was
on
the
ground
floor
,
not
going
down
*NL*
to
the
terrace
on
which
he
stood
.
His
face
was
close
to
the
glass
,
*NL*
yet
the
effect
of
this
better
view
was
,
strangely
,
only
to
show
me
how
*NL*
intense
the
former
had
been
.
He
remained
but
a
few
seconds
--
long
enough
*NL*
to
convince
me
he
also
saw
and
recognized
;
but
it
was
as
if
I
had
been
*NL*
looking
at
him
for
years
and
had
known
him
always
.
Something
,
however
,
*NL*
happened
this
time
that
had
not
happened
before
;
his
stare
into
my
face
,
*NL*
through
the
glass
and
across
the
room
,
was
as
deep
and
hard
as
then
,
but
*NL*
it
quitted
me
for
a
moment
during
which
I
could
still
watch
it
,
see
it
*NL*
fix
successively
several
other
things
.
On
the
spot
there
came
to
me
the
*NL*
added
shock
of
a
certitude
that
it
was
not
for
me
he
had
come
there
.
He
*NL*
had
come
for
someone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flash
of
this
knowledge
--
for
it
was
knowledge
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
dread
--
produced
in
me
the
most
extraordinary
effect
,
started
as
I
stood
*NL*
there
,
a
sudden
vibration
of
duty
and
courage
.
I
say
courage
because
*NL*
I
was
beyond
all
doubt
already
far
gone
.
I
bounded
straight
out
of
the
*NL*
door
again
,
reached
that
of
the
house
,
got
,
in
an
instant
,
upon
the
*NL*
drive
,
and
,
passing
along
the
terrace
as
fast
as
I
could
rush
,
turned
*NL*
a
corner
and
came
full
in
sight
.
But
it
was
in
sight
of
nothing
now
--
my
*NL*
visitor
had
vanished
.
I
stopped
,
I
almost
dropped
,
with
the
real
relief
*NL*
of
this
;
but
I
took
in
the
whole
scene
--
I
gave
him
time
to
reappear
.
I
*NL*
call
it
time
,
but
how
long
was
it
?
I
ca
n't
speak
to
the
purpose
today
*NL*
of
the
duration
of
these
things
.
That
kind
of
measure
must
have
left
me
:
*NL*
they
could
n't
have
lasted
as
they
actually
appeared
to
me
to
last
.
The
*NL*
terrace
and
the
whole
place
,
the
lawn
and
the
garden
beyond
it
,
all
I
*NL*
could
see
of
the
park
,
were
empty
with
a
great
emptiness
.
There
were
*NL*
shrubberies
and
big
trees
,
but
I
remember
the
clear
assurance
I
felt
*NL*
that
none
of
them
concealed
him
.
He
was
there
or
was
not
there
:
not
*NL*
there
if
I
did
n't
see
him
.
I
got
hold
of
this
;
then
,
instinctively
,
*NL*
instead
of
returning
as
I
had
come
,
went
to
the
window
.
It
was
*NL*
confusedly
present
to
me
that
I
ought
to
place
myself
where
he
had
*NL*
stood
.
I
did
so
;
I
applied
my
face
to
the
pane
and
looked
,
as
he
had
*NL*
looked
,
into
the
room
.
As
if
,
at
this
moment
,
to
show
me
exactly
what
*NL*
his
range
had
been
,
Mrs.
Grose
,
as
I
had
done
for
himself
just
before
,
*NL*
came
in
from
the
hall
.
With
this
I
had
the
full
image
of
a
repetition
of
*NL*
what
had
already
occurred
.
She
saw
me
as
I
had
seen
my
own
visitant
;
she
*NL*
pulled
up
short
as
I
had
done
;
I
gave
her
something
of
the
shock
that
*NL*
I
had
received
.
She
turned
white
,
and
this
made
me
ask
myself
if
I
had
*NL*
blanched
as
much
.
She
stared
,
in
short
,
and
retreated
on
just
MY
lines
,
*NL*
and
I
knew
she
had
then
passed
out
and
come
round
to
me
and
that
I
*NL*
should
presently
meet
her
.
I
remained
where
I
was
,
and
while
I
waited
*NL*
I
thought
of
more
things
than
one
.
But
there
's
only
one
I
take
space
to
*NL*
mention
.
I
wondered
why
SHE
should
be
scared
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
she
let
me
know
as
soon
as
,
round
the
corner
of
the
house
,
she
*NL*
loomed
again
into
view
.
``
What
in
the
name
of
goodness
is
the
matter
--
?
''
*NL*
She
was
now
flushed
and
out
of
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
nothing
till
she
came
quite
near
.
``
With
me
?
''
I
must
have
made
a
*NL*
wonderful
face
.
``
Do
I
show
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
as
white
as
a
sheet
.
You
look
awful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
considered
;
I
could
meet
on
this
,
without
scruple
,
any
innocence
.
My
*NL*
need
to
respect
the
bloom
of
Mrs.
Grose
's
had
dropped
,
without
a
rustle
,
*NL*
from
my
shoulders
,
and
if
I
wavered
for
the
instant
it
was
not
with
what
*NL*
I
kept
back
.
I
put
out
my
hand
to
her
and
she
took
it
;
I
held
her
hard
*NL*
a
little
,
liking
to
feel
her
close
to
me
.
There
was
a
kind
of
support
in
*NL*
the
shy
heave
of
her
surprise
.
``
You
came
for
me
for
church
,
of
course
,
*NL*
but
I
ca
n't
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
anything
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
You
must
know
now
.
Did
I
look
very
queer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Through
this
window
?
Dreadful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
've
been
frightened
.
''
Mrs.
Grose
's
eyes
expressed
*NL*
plainly
that
SHE
had
no
wish
to
be
,
yet
also
that
she
knew
too
well
her
*NL*
place
not
to
be
ready
to
share
with
me
any
marked
inconvenience
.
Oh
,
*NL*
it
was
quite
settled
that
she
MUST
share
!
``
Just
what
you
saw
from
the
*NL*
dining
room
a
minute
ago
was
the
effect
of
that
.
What
_
I
_
saw
--
just
*NL*
before
--
was
much
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
hand
tightened
.
``
What
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
extraordinary
man
.
Looking
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
extraordinary
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
gazed
round
us
in
vain
.
``
Then
where
is
he
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
still
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
him
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
once
.
On
the
old
tower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
only
look
at
me
harder
.
``
Do
you
mean
he
's
a
stranger
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
did
n't
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
for
reasons
.
But
now
that
you
've
guessed
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
's
round
eyes
encountered
this
charge
.
``
Ah
,
I
have
n't
*NL*
guessed
!
''
she
said
very
simply
.
``
How
can
I
if
YOU
do
n't
imagine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
in
the
very
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
seen
him
nowhere
but
on
the
tower
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
on
this
spot
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
looked
round
again
.
``
What
was
he
doing
on
the
tower
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
standing
there
and
looking
down
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
a
minute
.
``
Was
he
a
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
I
had
no
need
to
think
.
``
No
.
''
She
gazed
in
deeper
wonder
.
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
nobody
about
the
place
?
Nobody
from
the
village
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
--
nobody
.
I
did
n't
tell
you
,
but
I
made
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
breathed
a
vague
relief
:
this
was
,
oddly
,
so
much
to
the
good
.
It
*NL*
only
went
indeed
a
little
way
.
``
But
if
he
is
n't
a
gentleman
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
IS
he
?
He
's
a
horror
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
horror
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
--
God
help
me
if
I
know
WHAT
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
looked
round
once
more
;
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
duskier
*NL*
distance
,
then
,
pulling
herself
together
,
turned
to
me
with
abrupt
*NL*
inconsequence
.
``
It
's
time
we
should
be
at
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
fit
for
church
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
it
do
you
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
do
THEM
--
!
I
nodded
at
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
leave
them
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
afraid
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
spoke
boldly
.
``
I
'm
afraid
of
HIM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
's
large
face
showed
me
,
at
this
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
*NL*
faraway
faint
glimmer
of
a
consciousness
more
acute
:
I
somehow
made
out
*NL*
in
it
the
delayed
dawn
of
an
idea
I
myself
had
not
given
her
and
that
*NL*
was
as
yet
quite
obscure
to
me
.
It
comes
back
to
me
that
I
thought
*NL*
instantly
of
this
as
something
I
could
get
from
her
;
and
I
felt
it
to
be
*NL*
connected
with
the
desire
she
presently
showed
to
know
more
.
``
When
was
*NL*
it
--
on
the
tower
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
the
middle
of
the
month
.
At
this
same
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Almost
at
dark
,
''
said
Mrs.
Grose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
not
nearly
.
I
saw
him
as
I
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
did
he
get
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
he
get
out
?
''
I
laughed
.
``
I
had
no
opportunity
to
ask
him
!
*NL*
This
evening
,
you
see
,
''
I
pursued
,
``
he
has
not
been
able
to
get
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
only
peeps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
will
be
confined
to
that
!
''
She
had
now
let
go
my
hand
;
she
*NL*
turned
away
a
little
.
I
waited
an
instant
;
then
I
brought
out
:
``
Go
to
*NL*
church
.
Goodbye
.
I
must
watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
she
faced
me
again
.
``
Do
you
fear
for
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
met
in
another
long
look
.
``
Do
n't
YOU
?
''
Instead
of
answering
she
came
*NL*
nearer
to
the
window
and
,
for
a
minute
,
applied
her
face
to
the
glass
.
*NL*
``
You
see
how
he
could
see
,
''
I
meanwhile
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
n't
move
.
``
How
long
was
he
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
I
came
out
.
I
came
to
meet
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
at
last
turned
round
,
and
there
was
still
more
in
her
face
.
*NL*
''
_
I
_
could
n't
have
come
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
could
I
!
''
I
laughed
again
.
``
But
I
did
come
.
I
have
my
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
have
I
mine
,
''
she
replied
;
after
which
she
added
:
``
What
is
he
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
dying
to
tell
you
.
But
he
's
like
nobody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
?
''
she
echoed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
no
hat
.
''
Then
seeing
in
her
face
that
she
already
,
in
this
,
with
*NL*
a
deeper
dismay
,
found
a
touch
of
picture
,
I
quickly
added
stroke
to
*NL*
stroke
.
``
He
has
red
hair
,
very
red
,
close-curling
,
and
a
pale
face
,
long
*NL*
in
shape
,
with
straight
,
good
features
and
little
,
rather
queer
whiskers
*NL*
that
are
as
red
as
his
hair
.
His
eyebrows
are
,
somehow
,
darker
;
they
*NL*
look
particularly
arched
and
as
if
they
might
move
a
good
deal
.
His
eyes
*NL*
are
sharp
,
strange
--
awfully
;
but
I
only
know
clearly
that
they
're
rather
*NL*
small
and
very
fixed
.
His
mouth
's
wide
,
and
his
lips
are
thin
,
and
*NL*
except
for
his
little
whiskers
he
's
quite
clean-shaven
.
He
gives
me
a
*NL*
sort
of
sense
of
looking
like
an
actor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
actor
!
''
It
was
impossible
to
resemble
one
less
,
at
least
,
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Grose
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
seen
one
,
but
so
I
suppose
them
.
He
's
tall
,
active
,
erect
,
''
*NL*
I
continued
,
``
but
never
--
no
,
never
!
--
a
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
companion
's
face
had
blanched
as
I
went
on
;
her
round
eyes
started
*NL*
and
her
mild
mouth
gaped
.
``
A
gentleman
?
''
she
gasped
,
confounded
,
*NL*
stupefied
:
``
a
gentleman
HE
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
him
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
visibly
tried
to
hold
herself
.
``
But
he
IS
handsome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
the
way
to
help
her
.
``
Remarkably
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
dressed
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
somebody
's
clothes
.
''
``
They
're
smart
,
but
they
're
not
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
broke
into
a
breathless
affirmative
groan
:
``
They
're
the
master
's
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
caught
it
up
.
``
You
DO
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
faltered
but
a
second
.
``
Quint
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quint
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peter
Quint
--
his
own
man
,
his
valet
,
when
he
was
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
master
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gaping
still
,
but
meeting
me
,
she
pieced
it
all
together
.
``
He
never
wore
*NL*
his
hat
,
but
he
did
wear
--
well
,
there
were
waistcoats
missed
.
They
were
*NL*
both
here
--
last
year
.
Then
the
master
went
,
and
Quint
was
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
followed
,
but
halting
a
little
.
``
Alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
with
US
.
''
Then
,
as
from
a
deeper
depth
,
``
In
charge
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
became
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hung
fire
so
long
that
I
was
still
more
mystified
.
``
He
went
,
too
,
''
*NL*
she
brought
out
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Went
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
expression
,
at
this
,
became
extraordinary
.
``
God
knows
where
!
He
*NL*
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Died
?
''
I
almost
shrieked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
fairly
to
square
herself
,
plant
herself
more
firmly
to
utter
*NL*
the
wonder
of
it
.
``
Yes
.
Mr.
Quint
is
dead
.
''
*NL*

VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
of
course
more
than
that
particular
passage
to
place
us
together
*NL*
in
presence
of
what
we
had
now
to
live
with
as
we
could
--
my
dreadful
*NL*
liability
to
impressions
of
the
order
so
vividly
exemplified
,
and
my
*NL*
companion
's
knowledge
,
henceforth
--
a
knowledge
half
consternation
and
*NL*
half
compassion
--
of
that
liability
.
There
had
been
,
this
evening
,
after
*NL*
the
revelation
left
me
,
for
an
hour
,
so
prostrate
--
there
had
been
,
for
*NL*
either
of
us
,
no
attendance
on
any
service
but
a
little
service
of
tears
*NL*
and
vows
,
of
prayers
and
promises
,
a
climax
to
the
series
of
mutual
*NL*
challenges
and
pledges
that
had
straightway
ensued
on
our
retreating
*NL*
together
to
the
schoolroom
and
shutting
ourselves
up
there
to
have
*NL*
everything
out
.
The
result
of
our
having
everything
out
was
simply
to
*NL*
reduce
our
situation
to
the
last
rigor
of
its
elements
.
She
herself
had
*NL*
seen
nothing
,
not
the
shadow
of
a
shadow
,
and
nobody
in
the
house
but
*NL*
the
governess
was
in
the
governess
's
plight
;
yet
she
accepted
without
*NL*
directly
impugning
my
sanity
the
truth
as
I
gave
it
to
her
,
and
ended
by
*NL*
showing
me
,
on
this
ground
,
an
awestricken
tenderness
,
an
expression
*NL*
of
the
sense
of
my
more
than
questionable
privilege
,
of
which
the
very
*NL*
breath
has
remained
with
me
as
that
of
the
sweetest
of
human
charities
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
settled
between
us
,
accordingly
,
that
night
,
was
that
we
*NL*
thought
we
might
bear
things
together
;
and
I
was
not
even
sure
that
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
her
exemption
,
it
was
she
who
had
the
best
of
the
burden
.
I
*NL*
knew
at
this
hour
,
I
think
,
as
well
as
I
knew
later
,
what
I
was
capable
*NL*
of
meeting
to
shelter
my
pupils
;
but
it
took
me
some
time
to
be
wholly
*NL*
sure
of
what
my
honest
ally
was
prepared
for
to
keep
terms
with
so
*NL*
compromising
a
contract
.
I
was
queer
company
enough
--
quite
as
queer
as
*NL*
the
company
I
received
;
but
as
I
trace
over
what
we
went
through
I
see
*NL*
how
much
common
ground
we
must
have
found
in
the
one
idea
that
,
by
good
*NL*
fortune
,
COULD
steady
us
.
It
was
the
idea
,
the
second
movement
,
that
led
*NL*
me
straight
out
,
as
I
may
say
,
of
the
inner
chamber
of
my
dread
.
I
could
*NL*
take
the
air
in
the
court
,
at
least
,
and
there
Mrs.
Grose
could
join
me
.
*NL*
Perfectly
can
I
recall
now
the
particular
way
strength
came
to
me
before
*NL*
we
separated
for
the
night
.
We
had
gone
over
and
over
every
feature
of
*NL*
what
I
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
looking
for
someone
else
,
you
say
--
someone
who
was
not
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
looking
for
little
Miles
.
''
A
portentous
clearness
now
possessed
*NL*
me
.
``
THAT
'S
whom
he
was
looking
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
I
know
,
I
know
!
''
My
exaltation
grew
.
``
And
YOU
know
,
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
n't
deny
this
,
but
I
required
,
I
felt
,
not
even
so
much
telling
*NL*
as
that
.
She
resumed
in
a
moment
,
at
any
rate
:
``
What
if
HE
should
see
*NL*
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
Miles
?
That
's
what
he
wants
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
immensely
scared
again
.
``
The
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forbid
!
The
man
.
He
wants
to
appear
to
THEM
.
''
That
he
might
was
*NL*
an
awful
conception
,
and
yet
,
somehow
,
I
could
keep
it
at
bay
;
which
,
*NL*
moreover
,
as
we
lingered
there
,
was
what
I
succeeded
in
practically
*NL*
proving
.
I
had
an
absolute
certainty
that
I
should
see
again
what
I
*NL*
had
already
seen
,
but
something
within
me
said
that
by
offering
myself
*NL*
bravely
as
the
sole
subject
of
such
experience
,
by
accepting
,
by
*NL*
inviting
,
by
surmounting
it
all
,
I
should
serve
as
an
expiatory
victim
*NL*
and
guard
the
tranquility
of
my
companions
.
The
children
,
in
especial
,
*NL*
I
should
thus
fence
about
and
absolutely
save
.
I
recall
one
of
the
last
*NL*
things
I
said
that
night
to
Mrs.
Grose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
strike
me
that
my
pupils
have
never
mentioned
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
me
hard
as
I
musingly
pulled
up
.
``
His
having
been
here
and
*NL*
the
time
they
were
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
they
were
with
him
,
and
his
name
,
his
presence
,
his
history
,
*NL*
in
any
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
little
lady
does
n't
remember
.
She
never
heard
or
knew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
circumstances
of
his
death
?
''
I
thought
with
some
intensity
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
.
But
Miles
would
remember
--
Miles
would
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
do
n't
try
him
!
''
broke
from
Mrs.
Grose
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
her
the
look
she
had
given
me
.
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
''
I
continued
*NL*
to
think
.
``
It
IS
rather
odd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
has
never
spoken
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
by
the
least
allusion
.
And
you
tell
me
they
were
`
great
*NL*
friends
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
was
n't
HIM
!
''
Mrs.
Grose
with
emphasis
declared
.
``
It
was
Quint
's
*NL*
own
fancy
.
To
play
with
him
,
I
mean
--
to
spoil
him
.
''
She
paused
a
moment
;
*NL*
then
she
added
:
``
Quint
was
much
too
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
gave
me
,
straight
from
my
vision
of
his
face
--
SUCH
a
face
!
--
a
*NL*
sudden
sickness
of
disgust
.
``
Too
free
with
MY
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
free
with
everyone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
forbore
,
for
the
moment
,
to
analyze
this
description
further
than
by
*NL*
the
reflection
that
a
part
of
it
applied
to
several
of
the
members
of
*NL*
the
household
,
of
the
half-dozen
maids
and
men
who
were
still
of
our
*NL*
small
colony
.
But
there
was
everything
,
for
our
apprehension
,
in
the
*NL*
lucky
fact
that
no
discomfortable
legend
,
no
perturbation
of
scullions
,
*NL*
had
ever
,
within
anyone
's
memory
attached
to
the
kind
old
place
.
It
had
*NL*
neither
bad
name
nor
ill
fame
,
and
Mrs.
Grose
,
most
apparently
,
only
*NL*
desired
to
cling
to
me
and
to
quake
in
silence
.
I
even
put
her
,
the
very
*NL*
last
thing
of
all
,
to
the
test
.
It
was
when
,
at
midnight
,
she
had
her
*NL*
hand
on
the
schoolroom
door
to
take
leave
.
``
I
have
it
from
you
then
--
for
*NL*
it
's
of
great
importance
--
that
he
was
definitely
and
admittedly
bad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
admittedly
.
_
I
_
knew
it
--
but
the
master
did
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
never
told
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
did
n't
like
tale-bearing
--
he
hated
complaints
.
He
was
terribly
*NL*
short
with
anything
of
that
kind
,
and
if
people
were
all
right
to
HIM
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
be
bothered
with
more
?
''
This
squared
well
enough
with
my
*NL*
impressions
of
him
:
he
was
not
a
trouble-loving
gentleman
,
nor
so
very
*NL*
particular
perhaps
about
some
of
the
company
HE
kept
.
All
the
same
,
I
*NL*
pressed
my
interlocutress
.
``
I
promise
you
_
I
_
would
have
told
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
my
discrimination
.
``
I
daresay
I
was
wrong
.
But
,
really
,
I
was
*NL*
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
things
that
man
could
do
.
Quint
was
so
clever
--
he
was
so
deep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
this
in
still
more
than
,
probably
,
I
showed
.
``
You
were
n't
afraid
*NL*
of
anything
else
?
Not
of
his
effect
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
effect
?
''
she
repeated
with
a
face
of
anguish
and
waiting
while
I
*NL*
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
innocent
little
precious
lives
.
They
were
in
your
charge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
were
not
in
mine
!
''
she
roundly
and
distressfully
returned
.
*NL*
``
The
master
believed
in
him
and
placed
him
here
because
he
was
supposed
*NL*
not
to
be
well
and
the
country
air
so
good
for
him
.
So
he
had
everything
*NL*
to
say
.
Yes
''
--
she
let
me
have
it
--
``
even
about
THEM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Them
--
that
creature
?
''
I
had
to
smother
a
kind
of
howl
.
``
And
you
could
*NL*
bear
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
could
n't
--
and
I
ca
n't
now
!
''
And
the
poor
woman
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
rigid
control
,
from
the
next
day
,
was
,
as
I
have
said
,
to
follow
them
;
*NL*
yet
how
often
and
how
passionately
,
for
a
week
,
we
came
back
together
*NL*
to
the
subject
!
Much
as
we
had
discussed
it
that
Sunday
night
,
I
was
,
in
*NL*
the
immediate
later
hours
in
especial
--
for
it
may
be
imagined
whether
I
*NL*
slept
--
still
haunted
with
the
shadow
of
something
she
had
not
told
me
.
*NL*
I
myself
had
kept
back
nothing
,
but
there
was
a
word
Mrs.
Grose
had
kept
*NL*
back
.
I
was
sure
,
moreover
,
by
morning
,
that
this
was
not
from
a
failure
*NL*
of
frankness
,
but
because
on
every
side
there
were
fears
.
It
seems
to
me
*NL*
indeed
,
in
retrospect
,
that
by
the
time
the
morrow
's
sun
was
high
I
had
*NL*
restlessly
read
into
the
fact
before
us
almost
all
the
meaning
they
were
*NL*
to
receive
from
subsequent
and
more
cruel
occurrences
.
What
they
gave
me
*NL*
above
all
was
just
the
sinister
figure
of
the
living
man
--
the
dead
one
*NL*
would
keep
awhile
!
--
and
of
the
months
he
had
continuously
passed
at
Bly
,
*NL*
which
,
added
up
,
made
a
formidable
stretch
.
The
limit
of
this
evil
time
*NL*
had
arrived
only
when
,
on
the
dawn
of
a
winter
's
morning
,
Peter
Quint
*NL*
was
found
,
by
a
laborer
going
to
early
work
,
stone
dead
on
the
road
*NL*
from
the
village
:
a
catastrophe
explained
--
superficially
at
least
--
by
a
*NL*
visible
wound
to
his
head
;
such
a
wound
as
might
have
been
produced
--
and
*NL*
as
,
on
the
final
evidence
,
HAD
been
--
by
a
fatal
slip
,
in
the
dark
and
*NL*
after
leaving
the
public
house
,
on
the
steepish
icy
slope
,
a
wrong
*NL*
path
altogether
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
he
lay
.
The
icy
slope
,
the
turn
*NL*
mistaken
at
night
and
in
liquor
,
accounted
for
much
--
practically
,
in
*NL*
the
end
and
after
the
inquest
and
boundless
chatter
,
for
everything
;
but
*NL*
there
had
been
matters
in
his
life
--
strange
passages
and
perils
,
secret
*NL*
disorders
,
vices
more
than
suspected
--
that
would
have
accounted
for
a
*NL*
good
deal
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
scarce
know
how
to
put
my
story
into
words
that
shall
be
a
credible
*NL*
picture
of
my
state
of
mind
;
but
I
was
in
these
days
literally
able
to
*NL*
find
a
joy
in
the
extraordinary
flight
of
heroism
the
occasion
demanded
*NL*
of
me
.
I
now
saw
that
I
had
been
asked
for
a
service
admirable
and
*NL*
difficult
;
and
there
would
be
a
greatness
in
letting
it
be
seen
--
oh
,
in
*NL*
the
right
quarter
!
--
that
I
could
succeed
where
many
another
girl
might
*NL*
have
failed
.
It
was
an
immense
help
to
me
--
I
confess
I
rather
applaud
*NL*
myself
as
I
look
back
!
--
that
I
saw
my
service
so
strongly
and
so
simply
.
*NL*
I
was
there
to
protect
and
defend
the
little
creatures
in
the
world
the
*NL*
most
bereaved
and
the
most
lovable
,
the
appeal
of
whose
helplessness
had
*NL*
suddenly
become
only
too
explicit
,
a
deep
,
constant
ache
of
one
's
own
*NL*
committed
heart
.
We
were
cut
off
,
really
,
together
;
we
were
united
in
*NL*
our
danger
.
They
had
nothing
but
me
,
and
I
--
well
,
I
had
THEM
.
It
was
*NL*
in
short
a
magnificent
chance
.
This
chance
presented
itself
to
me
in
an
*NL*
image
richly
material
.
I
was
a
screen
--
I
was
to
stand
before
them
.
The
*NL*
more
I
saw
,
the
less
they
would
.
I
began
to
watch
them
in
a
stifled
*NL*
suspense
,
a
disguised
excitement
that
might
well
,
had
it
continued
too
*NL*
long
,
have
turned
to
something
like
madness
.
What
saved
me
,
as
I
now
*NL*
see
,
was
that
it
turned
to
something
else
altogether
.
It
did
n't
last
as
*NL*
suspense
--
it
was
superseded
by
horrible
proofs
.
Proofs
,
I
say
,
yes
--
from
*NL*
the
moment
I
really
took
hold
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
moment
dated
from
an
afternoon
hour
that
I
happened
to
spend
in
the
*NL*
grounds
with
the
younger
of
my
pupils
alone
.
We
had
left
Miles
indoors
,
*NL*
on
the
red
cushion
of
a
deep
window
seat
;
he
had
wished
to
finish
a
*NL*
book
,
and
I
had
been
glad
to
encourage
a
purpose
so
laudable
in
a
young
*NL*
man
whose
only
defect
was
an
occasional
excess
of
the
restless
.
His
*NL*
sister
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
been
alert
to
come
out
,
and
I
strolled
with
*NL*
her
half
an
hour
,
seeking
the
shade
,
for
the
sun
was
still
high
and
the
*NL*
day
exceptionally
warm
.
I
was
aware
afresh
,
with
her
,
as
we
went
,
of
*NL*
how
,
like
her
brother
,
she
contrived
--
it
was
the
charming
thing
in
both
*NL*
children
--
to
let
me
alone
without
appearing
to
drop
me
and
to
accompany
*NL*
me
without
appearing
to
surround
.
They
were
never
importunate
and
yet
*NL*
never
listless
.
My
attention
to
them
all
really
went
to
seeing
them
*NL*
amuse
themselves
immensely
without
me
:
this
was
a
spectacle
they
seemed
*NL*
actively
to
prepare
and
that
engaged
me
as
an
active
admirer
.
I
walked
*NL*
in
a
world
of
their
invention
--
they
had
no
occasion
whatever
to
draw
*NL*
upon
mine
;
so
that
my
time
was
taken
only
with
being
,
for
them
,
some
*NL*
remarkable
person
or
thing
that
the
game
of
the
moment
required
and
that
*NL*
was
merely
,
thanks
to
my
superior
,
my
exalted
stamp
,
a
happy
and
highly
*NL*
distinguished
sinecure
.
I
forget
what
I
was
on
the
present
occasion
;
*NL*
I
only
remember
that
I
was
something
very
important
and
very
quiet
and
*NL*
that
Flora
was
playing
very
hard
.
We
were
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
,
and
,
*NL*
as
we
had
lately
begun
geography
,
the
lake
was
the
Sea
of
Azof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
in
these
circumstances
,
I
became
aware
that
,
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
Sea
of
Azof
,
we
had
an
interested
spectator
.
The
way
this
*NL*
knowledge
gathered
in
me
was
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
--
the
*NL*
strangest
,
that
is
,
except
the
very
much
stranger
in
which
it
quickly
*NL*
merged
itself
.
I
had
sat
down
with
a
piece
of
work
--
for
I
was
something
*NL*
or
other
that
could
sit
--
on
the
old
stone
bench
which
overlooked
the
*NL*
pond
;
and
in
this
position
I
began
to
take
in
with
certitude
,
and
yet
*NL*
without
direct
vision
,
the
presence
,
at
a
distance
,
of
a
third
person
.
*NL*
The
old
trees
,
the
thick
shrubbery
,
made
a
great
and
pleasant
shade
,
but
*NL*
it
was
all
suffused
with
the
brightness
of
the
hot
,
still
hour
.
There
*NL*
was
no
ambiguity
in
anything
;
none
whatever
,
at
least
,
in
the
conviction
*NL*
I
from
one
moment
to
another
found
myself
forming
as
to
what
I
should
*NL*
see
straight
before
me
and
across
the
lake
as
a
consequence
of
raising
*NL*
my
eyes
.
They
were
attached
at
this
juncture
to
the
stitching
in
which
I
*NL*
was
engaged
,
and
I
can
feel
once
more
the
spasm
of
my
effort
not
to
move
*NL*
them
till
I
should
so
have
steadied
myself
as
to
be
able
to
make
up
my
*NL*
mind
what
to
do
.
There
was
an
alien
object
in
view
--
a
figure
whose
right
*NL*
of
presence
I
instantly
,
passionately
questioned
.
I
recollect
counting
*NL*
over
perfectly
the
possibilities
,
reminding
myself
that
nothing
was
more
*NL*
natural
,
for
instance
,
then
the
appearance
of
one
of
the
men
about
the
*NL*
place
,
or
even
of
a
messenger
,
a
postman
,
or
a
tradesman
's
boy
,
from
the
*NL*
village
.
That
reminder
had
as
little
effect
on
my
practical
certitude
*NL*
as
I
was
conscious
--
still
even
without
looking
--
of
its
having
upon
the
*NL*
character
and
attitude
of
our
visitor
.
Nothing
was
more
natural
than
*NL*
that
these
things
should
be
the
other
things
that
they
absolutely
were
*NL*
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
positive
identity
of
the
apparition
I
would
assure
myself
as
*NL*
soon
as
the
small
clock
of
my
courage
should
have
ticked
out
the
right
*NL*
second
;
meanwhile
,
with
an
effort
that
was
already
sharp
enough
,
I
*NL*
transferred
my
eyes
straight
to
little
Flora
,
who
,
at
the
moment
,
was
*NL*
about
ten
yards
away
.
My
heart
had
stood
still
for
an
instant
with
the
*NL*
wonder
and
terror
of
the
question
whether
she
too
would
see
;
and
I
*NL*
held
my
breath
while
I
waited
for
what
a
cry
from
her
,
what
some
sudden
*NL*
innocent
sign
either
of
interest
or
of
alarm
,
would
tell
me
.
I
waited
,
*NL*
but
nothing
came
;
then
,
in
the
first
place
--
and
there
is
something
*NL*
more
dire
in
this
,
I
feel
,
than
in
anything
I
have
to
relate
--
I
was
*NL*
determined
by
a
sense
that
,
within
a
minute
,
all
sounds
from
her
had
*NL*
previously
dropped
;
and
,
in
the
second
,
by
the
circumstance
that
,
also
*NL*
within
the
minute
,
she
had
,
in
her
play
,
turned
her
back
to
the
water
.
*NL*
This
was
her
attitude
when
I
at
last
looked
at
her
--
looked
with
the
*NL*
confirmed
conviction
that
we
were
still
,
together
,
under
direct
personal
*NL*
notice
.
She
had
picked
up
a
small
flat
piece
of
wood
,
which
happened
to
*NL*
have
in
it
a
little
hole
that
had
evidently
suggested
to
her
the
idea
*NL*
of
sticking
in
another
fragment
that
might
figure
as
a
mast
and
make
*NL*
the
thing
a
boat
.
This
second
morsel
,
as
I
watched
her
,
she
was
*NL*
very
markedly
and
intently
attempting
to
tighten
in
its
place
.
My
*NL*
apprehension
of
what
she
was
doing
sustained
me
so
that
after
some
*NL*
seconds
I
felt
I
was
ready
for
more
.
Then
I
again
shifted
my
eyes
--
I
*NL*
faced
what
I
had
to
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
hold
of
Mrs.
Grose
as
soon
after
this
as
I
could
;
and
I
can
give
*NL*
no
intelligible
account
of
how
I
fought
out
the
interval
.
Yet
I
still
*NL*
hear
myself
cry
as
I
fairly
threw
myself
into
her
arms
:
``
They
KNOW
--
it
's
*NL*
too
monstrous
:
they
know
,
they
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
on
earth
--
?
''
I
felt
her
incredulity
as
she
held
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
all
that
WE
know
--
and
heaven
knows
what
else
besides
!
''
Then
,
as
*NL*
she
released
me
,
I
made
it
out
to
her
,
made
it
out
perhaps
only
now
with
*NL*
full
coherency
even
to
myself
.
``
Two
hours
ago
,
in
the
garden
''
--
I
could
*NL*
scarce
articulate
--
``
Flora
SAW
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
took
it
as
she
might
have
taken
a
blow
in
the
stomach
.
``
She
*NL*
has
told
you
?
''
she
panted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
word
--
that
's
the
horror
.
She
kept
it
to
herself
!
The
child
of
*NL*
eight
,
THAT
child
!
''
Unutterable
still
,
for
me
,
was
the
stupefaction
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
,
of
course
,
could
only
gape
the
wider
.
``
Then
how
do
you
*NL*
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
there
--
I
saw
with
my
eyes
:
saw
that
she
was
perfectly
aware
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
aware
of
HIM
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
of
HER
.
''
I
was
conscious
as
I
spoke
that
I
looked
prodigious
*NL*
things
,
for
I
got
the
slow
reflection
of
them
in
my
companion
's
face
.
*NL*
``
Another
person
--
this
time
;
but
a
figure
of
quite
as
unmistakable
horror
*NL*
and
evil
:
a
woman
in
black
,
pale
and
dreadful
--
with
such
an
air
also
,
*NL*
and
such
a
face
!
--
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
.
I
was
there
with
the
*NL*
child
--
quiet
for
the
hour
;
and
in
the
midst
of
it
she
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Came
how
--
from
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
where
they
come
from
!
She
just
appeared
and
stood
there
--
but
not
*NL*
so
near
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
without
coming
nearer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
for
the
effect
and
the
feeling
,
she
might
have
been
as
close
as
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
friend
,
with
an
odd
impulse
,
fell
back
a
step
.
``
Was
she
someone
*NL*
you
've
never
seen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
someone
the
child
has
.
Someone
YOU
have
.
''
Then
,
to
show
how
I
*NL*
had
thought
it
all
out
:
``
My
predecessor
--
the
one
who
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Jessel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Jessel
.
You
do
n't
believe
me
?
''
I
pressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
right
and
left
in
her
distress
.
``
How
can
you
be
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
drew
from
me
,
in
the
state
of
my
nerves
,
a
flash
of
impatience
.
*NL*
``
Then
ask
Flora
--
SHE
'S
sure
!
''
But
I
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
I
caught
*NL*
myself
up
.
``
No
,
for
God
's
sake
,
DO
N'T
!
She
'll
say
she
is
n't
--
she
'll
*NL*
lie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
was
not
too
bewildered
instinctively
to
protest
.
``
Ah
,
how
CAN
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
'm
clear
.
Flora
does
n't
want
me
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
then
to
spare
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
--
there
are
depths
,
depths
!
The
more
I
go
over
it
,
the
more
I
see
*NL*
in
it
,
and
the
more
I
see
in
it
,
the
more
I
fear
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
*NL*
DO
N'T
see
--
what
I
DO
N'T
fear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
tried
to
keep
up
with
me
.
``
You
mean
you
're
afraid
of
seeing
*NL*
her
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
that
's
nothing
--
now
!
''
Then
I
explained
.
``
It
's
of
NOT
seeing
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
companion
only
looked
wan
.
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
that
the
child
may
keep
it
up
--
and
that
the
child
assuredly
*NL*
WILL
--
without
my
knowing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
image
of
this
possibility
Mrs.
Grose
for
a
moment
collapsed
,
yet
*NL*
presently
to
pull
herself
together
again
,
as
if
from
the
positive
force
*NL*
of
the
sense
of
what
,
should
we
yield
an
inch
,
there
would
really
be
to
*NL*
give
way
to
.
``
Dear
,
dear
--
we
must
keep
our
heads
!
And
after
all
,
if
she
*NL*
does
n't
mind
it
--
!
''
She
even
tried
a
grim
joke
.
``
Perhaps
she
likes
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Likes
SUCH
things
--
a
scrap
of
an
infant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
just
a
proof
of
her
blessed
innocence
?
''
my
friend
bravely
*NL*
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
brought
me
,
for
the
instant
,
almost
round
.
``
Oh
,
we
must
clutch
at
*NL*
THAT
--
we
must
cling
to
it
!
If
it
is
n't
a
proof
of
what
you
say
,
it
's
a
*NL*
proof
of
--
God
knows
what
!
For
the
woman
's
a
horror
of
horrors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
,
at
this
,
fixed
her
eyes
a
minute
on
the
ground
;
then
at
last
*NL*
raising
them
,
``
Tell
me
how
you
know
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
admit
it
's
what
she
was
?
''
I
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
how
you
know
,
''
my
friend
simply
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
?
By
seeing
her
!
By
the
way
she
looked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
you
,
do
you
mean

so
wickedly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
no
--
I
could
have
borne
that
.
She
gave
me
never
a
glance
.
She
*NL*
only
fixed
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
tried
to
see
it
.
``
Fixed
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
with
such
awful
eyes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stared
at
mine
as
if
they
might
really
have
resembled
them
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
mean
of
dislike
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
help
us
,
no
.
Of
something
much
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worse
than
dislike
?
--
this
left
her
indeed
at
a
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
a
determination
--
indescribable
.
With
a
kind
of
fury
of
intention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
her
turn
pale
.
``
Intention
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
get
hold
of
her
.
''
Mrs.
Grose
--
her
eyes
just
lingering
on
mine
--
gave
*NL*
a
shudder
and
walked
to
the
window
;
and
while
she
stood
there
looking
*NL*
out
I
completed
my
statement
.
``
THAT
'S
what
Flora
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
she
turned
round
.
``
The
person
was
in
black
,
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
mourning
--
rather
poor
,
almost
shabby
.
But
--
yes
--
with
extraordinary
*NL*
beauty
.
''
I
now
recognized
to
what
I
had
at
last
,
stroke
by
stroke
,
*NL*
brought
the
victim
of
my
confidence
,
for
she
quite
visibly
weighed
*NL*
this
.
``
Oh
,
handsome
--
very
,
very
,
''
I
insisted
;
``
wonderfully
handsome
.
But
*NL*
infamous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
slowly
came
back
to
me
.
``
Miss
Jessel
--
WAS
infamous
.
''
She
once
more
*NL*
took
my
hand
in
both
her
own
,
holding
it
as
tight
as
if
to
fortify
me
*NL*
against
the
increase
of
alarm
I
might
draw
from
this
disclosure
.
``
They
*NL*
were
both
infamous

''
she
finally
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
for
a
little
,
we
faced
it
once
more
together
;
and
I
found
absolutely
*NL*
a
degree
of
help
in
seeing
it
now
so
straight
.
``
I
appreciate
,
''
I
said
,
*NL*
``
the
great
decency
of
your
not
having
hitherto
spoken
;
but
the
time
has
*NL*
certainly
come
to
give
me
the
whole
thing
.
''
She
appeared
to
assent
to
*NL*
this
,
but
still
only
in
silence
;
seeing
which
I
went
on
:
``
I
must
have
it
*NL*
now
.
Of
what
did
she
die
?
Come
,
there
was
something
between
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
spite
of
the
difference
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
their
rank
,
their
condition
''
--
she
brought
it
woefully
out
.
``
SHE
*NL*
was
a
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
it
over
;
I
again
saw
.
``
Yes
--
she
was
a
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
so
dreadfully
below
,
''
said
Mrs.
Grose
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
that
I
doubtless
need
n't
press
too
hard
,
in
such
company
,
on
the
*NL*
place
of
a
servant
in
the
scale
;
but
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
an
*NL*
acceptance
of
my
companion
's
own
measure
of
my
predecessor
's
abasement
.
*NL*
There
was
a
way
to
deal
with
that
,
and
I
dealt
;
the
more
readily
for
*NL*
my
full
vision
--
on
the
evidence
--
of
our
employer
's
late
clever
,
*NL*
good-looking
``
own
''
man
;
impudent
,
assured
,
spoiled
,
depraved
.
``
The
*NL*
fellow
was
a
hound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
considered
as
if
it
were
perhaps
a
little
a
case
for
a
sense
*NL*
of
shades
.
``
I
've
never
seen
one
like
him
.
He
did
what
he
wished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
HER
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
them
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
if
now
in
my
friend
's
own
eyes
Miss
Jessel
had
again
appeared
.
*NL*
I
seemed
at
any
rate
,
for
an
instant
,
to
see
their
evocation
of
her
*NL*
as
distinctly
as
I
had
seen
her
by
the
pond
;
and
I
brought
out
with
*NL*
decision
:
``
It
must
have
been
also
what
SHE
wished
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
's
face
signified
that
it
had
been
indeed
,
but
she
said
at
the
*NL*
same
time
:
``
Poor
woman
--
she
paid
for
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
know
what
she
died
of
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
know
nothing
.
I
wanted
not
to
know
;
I
was
glad
enough
I
did
n't
;
*NL*
and
I
thanked
heaven
she
was
well
out
of
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
had
,
then
,
your
idea
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
her
real
reason
for
leaving
?
Oh
,
yes
--
as
to
that
.
She
could
n't
have
*NL*
stayed
.
Fancy
it
here
--
for
a
governess
!
And
afterward
I
imagined
--
and
I
*NL*
still
imagine
.
And
what
I
imagine
is
dreadful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
dreadful
as
what
_
I
_
do
,
''
I
replied
;
on
which
I
must
have
shown
*NL*
her
--
as
I
was
indeed
but
too
conscious
--
a
front
of
miserable
defeat
.
It
*NL*
brought
out
again
all
her
compassion
for
me
,
and
at
the
renewed
touch
of
*NL*
her
kindness
my
power
to
resist
broke
down
.
I
burst
,
as
I
had
,
the
other
*NL*
time
,
made
her
burst
,
into
tears
;
she
took
me
to
her
motherly
breast
,
*NL*
and
my
lamentation
overflowed
.
``
I
do
n't
do
it
!
''
I
sobbed
in
despair
;
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
save
or
shield
them
!
It
's
far
worse
than
I
dreamed
--
they
're
lost
!

VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
had
said
to
Mrs.
Grose
was
true
enough
:
there
were
in
the
matter
*NL*
I
had
put
before
her
depths
and
possibilities
that
I
lacked
resolution
*NL*
to
sound
;
so
that
when
we
met
once
more
in
the
wonder
of
it
we
were
of
a
*NL*
common
mind
about
the
duty
of
resistance
to
extravagant
fancies
.
We
were
*NL*
to
keep
our
heads
if
we
should
keep
nothing
else
--
difficult
indeed
as
*NL*
that
might
be
in
the
face
of
what
,
in
our
prodigious
experience
,
was
*NL*
least
to
be
questioned
.
Late
that
night
,
while
the
house
slept
,
we
had
*NL*
another
talk
in
my
room
,
when
she
went
all
the
way
with
me
as
to
its
*NL*
being
beyond
doubt
that
I
had
seen
exactly
what
I
had
seen
.
To
hold
her
*NL*
perfectly
in
the
pinch
of
that
,
I
found
I
had
only
to
ask
her
how
,
if
*NL*
I
had
``
made
it
up
,
''
I
came
to
be
able
to
give
,
of
each
of
the
persons
*NL*
appearing
to
me
,
a
picture
disclosing
,
to
the
last
detail
,
their
*NL*
special
marks
--
a
portrait
on
the
exhibition
of
which
she
had
instantly
*NL*
recognized
and
named
them
.
She
wished
of
course
--
small
blame
to
her
!
--
to
*NL*
sink
the
whole
subject
;
and
I
was
quick
to
assure
her
that
my
own
*NL*
interest
in
it
had
now
violently
taken
the
form
of
a
search
for
the
way
*NL*
to
escape
from
it
.
I
encountered
her
on
the
ground
of
a
probability
that
*NL*
with
recurrence
--
for
recurrence
we
took
for
granted
--
I
should
get
*NL*
used
to
my
danger
,
distinctly
professing
that
my
personal
exposure
had
*NL*
suddenly
become
the
least
of
my
discomforts
.
It
was
my
new
suspicion
*NL*
that
was
intolerable
;
and
yet
even
to
this
complication
the
later
hours
*NL*
of
the
day
had
brought
a
little
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
leaving
her
,
after
my
first
outbreak
,
I
had
of
course
returned
to
my
*NL*
pupils
,
associating
the
right
remedy
for
my
dismay
with
that
sense
of
*NL*
their
charm
which
I
had
already
found
to
be
a
thing
I
could
positively
*NL*
cultivate
and
which
had
never
failed
me
yet
.
I
had
simply
,
in
other
*NL*
words
,
plunged
afresh
into
Flora
's
special
society
and
there
become
*NL*
aware
--
it
was
almost
a
luxury
!
--
that
she
could
put
her
little
conscious
*NL*
hand
straight
upon
the
spot
that
ached
.
She
had
looked
at
me
in
sweet
*NL*
speculation
and
then
had
accused
me
to
my
face
of
having
``
cried
.
''
I
had
*NL*
supposed
I
had
brushed
away
the
ugly
signs
:
but
I
could
literally
--
for
*NL*
the
time
,
at
all
events
--
rejoice
,
under
this
fathomless
charity
,
that
*NL*
they
had
not
entirely
disappeared
.
To
gaze
into
the
depths
of
blue
of
*NL*
the
child
's
eyes
and
pronounce
their
loveliness
a
trick
of
premature
*NL*
cunning
was
to
be
guilty
of
a
cynicism
in
preference
to
which
I
*NL*
naturally
preferred
to
abjure
my
judgment
and
,
so
far
as
might
be
,
my
*NL*
agitation
.
I
could
n't
abjure
for
merely
wanting
to
,
but
I
could
repeat
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Grose
--
as
I
did
there
,
over
and
over
,
in
the
small
hours
--
that
*NL*
with
their
voices
in
the
air
,
their
pressure
on
one
's
heart
,
and
their
*NL*
fragrant
faces
against
one
's
cheek
,
everything
fell
to
the
ground
but
*NL*
their
incapacity
and
their
beauty
.
It
was
a
pity
that
,
somehow
,
to
*NL*
settle
this
once
for
all
,
I
had
equally
to
re-enumerate
the
signs
of
*NL*
subtlety
that
,
in
the
afternoon
,
by
the
lake
had
made
a
miracle
of
my
*NL*
show
of
self-possession
.
It
was
a
pity
to
be
obliged
to
reinvestigate
*NL*
the
certitude
of
the
moment
itself
and
repeat
how
it
had
come
to
me
as
*NL*
a
revelation
that
the
inconceivable
communion
I
then
surprised
was
a
*NL*
matter
,
for
either
party
,
of
habit
.
It
was
a
pity
that
I
should
have
had
*NL*
to
quaver
out
again
the
reasons
for
my
not
having
,
in
my
delusion
,
*NL*
so
much
as
questioned
that
the
little
girl
saw
our
visitant
even
as
I
*NL*
actually
saw
Mrs.
Grose
herself
,
and
that
she
wanted
,
by
just
so
much
as
*NL*
she
did
thus
see
,
to
make
me
suppose
she
did
n't
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
without
showing
anything
,
arrive
at
a
guess
as
to
whether
I
myself
did
!
*NL*
It
was
a
pity
that
I
needed
once
more
to
describe
the
portentous
little
*NL*
activity
by
which
she
sought
to
divert
my
attention
--
the
perceptible
*NL*
increase
of
movement
,
the
greater
intensity
of
play
,
the
singing
,
the
*NL*
gabbling
of
nonsense
,
and
the
invitation
to
romp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
if
I
had
not
indulged
,
to
prove
there
was
nothing
in
it
,
in
this
*NL*
review
,
I
should
have
missed
the
two
or
three
dim
elements
of
comfort
*NL*
that
still
remained
to
me
.
I
should
not
for
instance
have
been
able
to
*NL*
asseverate
to
my
friend
that
I
was
certain
--
which
was
so
much
to
the
*NL*
good
--
that
_
I
_
at
least
had
not
betrayed
myself
.
I
should
not
have
been
*NL*
prompted
,
by
stress
of
need
,
by
desperation
of
mind
--
I
scarce
know
what
*NL*
to
call
it
--
to
invoke
such
further
aid
to
intelligence
as
might
spring
*NL*
from
pushing
my
colleague
fairly
to
the
wall
.
She
had
told
me
,
bit
by
*NL*
bit
,
under
pressure
,
a
great
deal
;
but
a
small
shifty
spot
on
the
wrong
*NL*
side
of
it
all
still
sometimes
brushed
my
brow
like
the
wing
of
a
bat
;
*NL*
and
I
remember
how
on
this
occasion
--
for
the
sleeping
house
and
the
*NL*
concentration
alike
of
our
danger
and
our
watch
seemed
to
help
--
I
felt
*NL*
the
importance
of
giving
the
last
jerk
to
the
curtain
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
anything
so
horrible
,
''
I
recollect
saying
;
``
no
,
let
us
put
it
*NL*
definitely
,
my
dear
,
that
I
do
n't
.
But
if
I
did
,
you
know
,
there
's
*NL*
a
thing
I
should
require
now
,
just
without
sparing
you
the
least
bit
*NL*
more
--
oh
,
not
a
scrap
,
come
!
--
to
get
out
of
you
.
What
was
it
you
had
in
*NL*
mind
when
,
in
our
distress
,
before
Miles
came
back
,
over
the
letter
from
*NL*
his
school
,
you
said
,
under
my
insistence
,
that
you
did
n't
pretend
for
*NL*
him
that
he
had
not
literally
EVER
been
`
bad
'
?
He
has
NOT
literally
*NL*
`
ever
,
'
in
these
weeks
that
I
myself
have
lived
with
him
and
so
closely
*NL*
watched
him
;
he
has
been
an
imperturbable
little
prodigy
of
delightful
,
*NL*
lovable
goodness
.
Therefore
you
might
perfectly
have
made
the
claim
for
*NL*
him
if
you
had
not
,
as
it
happened
,
seen
an
exception
to
take
.
What
was
*NL*
your
exception
,
and
to
what
passage
in
your
personal
observation
of
him
*NL*
did
you
refer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
dreadfully
austere
inquiry
,
but
levity
was
not
our
note
,
and
,
*NL*
at
any
rate
,
before
the
gray
dawn
admonished
us
to
separate
I
had
got
*NL*
my
answer
.
What
my
friend
had
had
in
mind
proved
to
be
immensely
to
the
*NL*
purpose
.
It
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
circumstance
that
for
*NL*
a
period
of
several
months
Quint
and
the
boy
had
been
perpetually
*NL*
together
.
It
was
in
fact
the
very
appropriate
truth
that
she
had
*NL*
ventured
to
criticize
the
propriety
,
to
hint
at
the
incongruity
,
of
*NL*
so
close
an
alliance
,
and
even
to
go
so
far
on
the
subject
as
a
frank
*NL*
overture
to
Miss
Jessel
.
Miss
Jessel
had
,
with
a
most
strange
manner
,
*NL*
requested
her
to
mind
her
business
,
and
the
good
woman
had
,
on
this
,
*NL*
directly
approached
little
Miles
.
What
she
had
said
to
him
,
since
I
*NL*
pressed
,
was
that
SHE
liked
to
see
young
gentlemen
not
forget
their
*NL*
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
pressed
again
,
of
course
,
at
this
.
``
You
reminded
him
that
Quint
was
*NL*
only
a
base
menial
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
might
say
!
And
it
was
his
answer
,
for
one
thing
,
that
was
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
for
another
thing
?
''
I
waited
.
``
He
repeated
your
words
to
Quint
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
that
.
It
's
just
what
he
WOULD
N'T
!
''
she
could
still
impress
upon
*NL*
me
.
``
I
was
sure
,
at
any
rate
,
''
she
added
,
``
that
he
did
n't
.
But
he
denied
*NL*
certain
occasions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
occasions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
they
had
been
about
together
quite
as
if
Quint
were
his
tutor
--
and
*NL*
a
very
grand
one
--
and
Miss
Jessel
only
for
the
little
lady
.
When
he
had
*NL*
gone
off
with
the
fellow
,
I
mean
,
and
spent
hours
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
then
prevaricated
about
it
--
he
said
he
had
n't
?
''
Her
assent
was
clear
*NL*
enough
to
cause
me
to
add
in
a
moment
:
``
I
see
.
He
lied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
Mrs.
Grose
mumbled
.
This
was
a
suggestion
that
it
did
n't
matter
;
*NL*
which
indeed
she
backed
up
by
a
further
remark
.
``
You
see
,
after
all
,
*NL*
Miss
Jessel
did
n't
mind
.
She
did
n't
forbid
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
considered
.
``
Did
he
put
that
to
you
as
a
justification
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
she
dropped
again
.
``
No
,
he
never
spoke
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mentioned
her
in
connection
with
Quint
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
,
visibly
flushing
,
where
I
was
coming
out
.
``
Well
,
he
did
n't
show
*NL*
anything
.
He
denied
,
''
she
repeated
;
``
he
denied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
,
how
I
pressed
her
now
!
``
So
that
you
could
see
he
knew
what
was
*NL*
between
the
two
wretches
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
I
do
n't
know
!
''
the
poor
woman
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
know
,
you
dear
thing
,
''
I
replied
;
``
only
you
have
n't
my
dreadful
*NL*
boldness
of
mind
,
and
you
keep
back
,
out
of
timidity
and
modesty
and
*NL*
delicacy
,
even
the
impression
that
,
in
the
past
,
when
you
had
,
without
*NL*
my
aid
,
to
flounder
about
in
silence
,
most
of
all
made
you
miserable
.
*NL*
But
I
shall
get
it
out
of
you
yet
!
There
was
something
in
the
boy
that
*NL*
suggested
to
you
,
''
I
continued
,
``
that
he
covered
and
concealed
their
*NL*
relation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
could
n't
prevent
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
learning
the
truth
?
I
daresay
!
But
,
heavens
,
''
I
fell
,
with
*NL*
vehemence
,
athinking
,
``
what
it
shows
that
they
must
,
to
that
extent
,
*NL*
have
succeeded
in
making
of
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
nothing
that
's
not
nice
NOW
!
''
Mrs.
Grose
lugubriously
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wonder
you
looked
queer
,
''
I
persisted
,
``
when
I
mentioned
to
you
*NL*
the
letter
from
his
school
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubt
if
I
looked
as
queer
as
you
!
''
she
retorted
with
homely
force
.
*NL*
``
And
if
he
was
so
bad
then
as
that
comes
to
,
how
is
he
such
an
angel
*NL*
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
--
and
if
he
was
a
fiend
at
school
!
How
,
how
,
how
?
Well
,
''
*NL*
I
said
in
my
torment
,
``
you
must
put
it
to
me
again
,
but
I
shall
not
be
*NL*
able
to
tell
you
for
some
days
.
Only
,
put
it
to
me
again
!
''
I
cried
in
a
*NL*
way
that
made
my
friend
stare
.
``
There
are
directions
in
which
I
must
*NL*
not
for
the
present
let
myself
go
.
''
Meanwhile
I
returned
to
her
first
*NL*
example
--
the
one
to
which
she
had
just
previously
referred
--
of
the
boy
's
*NL*
happy
capacity
for
an
occasional
slip
.
``
If
Quint
--
on
your
remonstrance
*NL*
at
the
time
you
speak
of
--
was
a
base
menial
,
one
of
the
things
Miles
*NL*
said
to
you
,
I
find
myself
guessing
,
was
that
you
were
another
.
''
Again
*NL*
her
admission
was
so
adequate
that
I
continued
:
``
And
you
forgave
him
*NL*
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
YOU
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
And
we
exchanged
there
,
in
the
stillness
,
a
sound
of
the
*NL*
oddest
amusement
.
Then
I
went
on
:
``
At
all
events
,
while
he
was
with
the
*NL*
man
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Flora
was
with
the
woman
.
It
suited
them
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
suited
me
,
too
,
I
felt
,
only
too
well
;
by
which
I
mean
that
it
suited
*NL*
exactly
the
particularly
deadly
view
I
was
in
the
very
act
of
forbidding
*NL*
myself
to
entertain
.
But
I
so
far
succeeded
in
checking
the
expression
*NL*
of
this
view
that
I
will
throw
,
just
here
,
no
further
light
on
it
than
*NL*
may
be
offered
by
the
mention
of
my
final
observation
to
Mrs.
Grose
.
*NL*
``
His
having
lied
and
been
impudent
are
,
I
confess
,
less
engaging
*NL*
specimens
than
I
had
hoped
to
have
from
you
of
the
outbreak
in
him
of
*NL*
the
little
natural
man
.
Still
,
''
I
mused
,
``
They
must
do
,
for
they
make
me
*NL*
feel
more
than
ever
that
I
must
watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
me
blush
,
the
next
minute
,
to
see
in
my
friend
's
face
how
much
*NL*
more
unreservedly
she
had
forgiven
him
than
her
anecdote
struck
me
as
*NL*
presenting
to
my
own
tenderness
an
occasion
for
doing
.
This
came
out
*NL*
when
,
at
the
schoolroom
door
,
she
quitted
me
.
``
Surely
you
do
n't
accuse
*NL*
HIM
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
carrying
on
an
intercourse
that
he
conceals
from
me
?
Ah
,
remember
*NL*
that
,
until
further
evidence
,
I
now
accuse
nobody
.
''
Then
,
before
*NL*
shutting
her
out
to
go
,
by
another
passage
,
to
her
own
place
,
``
I
must
*NL*
just
wait
,
''
I
wound
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
waited
and
waited
,
and
the
days
,
as
they
elapsed
,
took
something
from
*NL*
my
consternation
.
A
very
few
of
them
,
in
fact
,
passing
,
in
constant
*NL*
sight
of
my
pupils
,
without
a
fresh
incident
,
sufficed
to
give
to
*NL*
grievous
fancies
and
even
to
odious
memories
a
kind
of
brush
of
the
*NL*
sponge
.
I
have
spoken
of
the
surrender
to
their
extraordinary
childish
*NL*
grace
as
a
thing
I
could
actively
cultivate
,
and
it
may
be
imagined
if
*NL*
I
neglected
now
to
address
myself
to
this
source
for
whatever
it
*NL*
would
yield
.
Stranger
than
I
can
express
,
certainly
,
was
the
effort
to
*NL*
struggle
against
my
new
lights
;
it
would
doubtless
have
been
,
however
,
*NL*
a
greater
tension
still
had
it
not
been
so
frequently
successful
.
I
*NL*
used
to
wonder
how
my
little
charges
could
help
guessing
that
I
thought
*NL*
strange
things
about
them
;
and
the
circumstances
that
these
things
only
*NL*
made
them
more
interesting
was
not
by
itself
a
direct
aid
to
keeping
*NL*
them
in
the
dark
.
I
trembled
lest
they
should
see
that
they
WERE
so
*NL*
immensely
more
interesting
.
Putting
things
at
the
worst
,
at
all
events
,
*NL*
as
in
meditation
I
so
often
did
,
any
clouding
of
their
innocence
could
*NL*
only
be
--
blameless
and
foredoomed
as
they
were
--
a
reason
the
more
for
*NL*
taking
risks
.
There
were
moments
when
,
by
an
irresistible
impulse
,
I
*NL*
found
myself
catching
them
up
and
pressing
them
to
my
heart
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
I
had
done
so
I
used
to
say
to
myself
:
``
What
will
they
think
of
that
?
*NL*
Does
n't
it
betray
too
much
?
''
It
would
have
been
easy
to
get
into
a
sad
,
*NL*
wild
tangle
about
how
much
I
might
betray
;
but
the
real
account
,
I
feel
,
*NL*
of
the
hours
of
peace
that
I
could
still
enjoy
was
that
the
immediate
*NL*
charm
of
my
companions
was
a
beguilement
still
effective
even
under
the
*NL*
shadow
of
the
possibility
that
it
was
studied
.
For
if
it
occurred
to
me
*NL*
that
I
might
occasionally
excite
suspicion
by
the
little
outbreaks
of
my
*NL*
sharper
passion
for
them
,
so
too
I
remember
wondering
if
I
might
n't
see
*NL*
a
queerness
in
the
traceable
increase
of
their
own
demonstrations
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
at
this
period
extravagantly
and
preternaturally
fond
of
me
;
*NL*
which
,
after
all
,
I
could
reflect
,
was
no
more
than
a
graceful
response
*NL*
in
children
perpetually
bowed
over
and
hugged
.
The
homage
of
which
they
*NL*
were
so
lavish
succeeded
,
in
truth
,
for
my
nerves
,
quite
as
well
as
if
*NL*
I
never
appeared
to
myself
,
as
I
may
say
,
literally
to
catch
them
at
a
*NL*
purpose
in
it
.
They
had
never
,
I
think
,
wanted
to
do
so
many
things
for
*NL*
their
poor
protectress
;
I
mean
--
though
they
got
their
lessons
better
and
*NL*
better
,
which
was
naturally
what
would
please
her
most
--
in
the
way
of
*NL*
diverting
,
entertaining
,
surprising
her
;
reading
her
passages
,
telling
*NL*
her
stories
,
acting
her
charades
,
pouncing
out
at
her
,
in
disguises
,
as
*NL*
animals
and
historical
characters
,
and
above
all
astonishing
her
by
the
*NL*
``
pieces
''
they
had
secretly
got
by
heart
and
could
interminably
recite
.
I
*NL*
should
never
get
to
the
bottom
--
were
I
to
let
myself
go
even
now
--
of
the
*NL*
prodigious
private
commentary
,
all
under
still
more
private
correction
,
*NL*
with
which
,
in
these
days
,
I
overscored
their
full
hours
.
They
had
shown
*NL*
me
from
the
first
a
facility
for
everything
,
a
general
faculty
which
,
*NL*
taking
a
fresh
start
,
achieved
remarkable
flights
.
They
got
their
little
*NL*
tasks
as
if
they
loved
them
,
and
indulged
,
from
the
mere
exuberance
of
*NL*
the
gift
,
in
the
most
unimposed
little
miracles
of
memory
.
They
not
*NL*
only
popped
out
at
me
as
tigers
and
as
Romans
,
but
as
Shakespeareans
,
*NL*
astronomers
,
and
navigators
.
This
was
so
singularly
the
case
that
it
had
*NL*
presumably
much
to
do
with
the
fact
as
to
which
,
at
the
present
day
,
*NL*
I
am
at
a
loss
for
a
different
explanation
:
I
allude
to
my
unnatural
*NL*
composure
on
the
subject
of
another
school
for
Miles
.
What
I
remember
*NL*
is
that
I
was
content
not
,
for
the
time
,
to
open
the
question
,
and
that
*NL*
contentment
must
have
sprung
from
the
sense
of
his
perpetually
striking
*NL*
show
of
cleverness
.
He
was
too
clever
for
a
bad
governess
,
for
a
*NL*
parson
's
daughter
,
to
spoil
;
and
the
strangest
if
not
the
brightest
*NL*
thread
in
the
pensive
embroidery
I
just
spoke
of
was
the
impression
I
*NL*
might
have
got
,
if
I
had
dared
to
work
it
out
,
that
he
was
under
some
*NL*
influence
operating
in
his
small
intellectual
life
as
a
tremendous
*NL*
incitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
was
easy
to
reflect
,
however
,
that
such
a
boy
could
postpone
*NL*
school
,
it
was
at
least
as
marked
that
for
such
a
boy
to
have
been
*NL*
``
kicked
out
''
by
a
schoolmaster
was
a
mystification
without
end
.
Let
me
*NL*
add
that
in
their
company
now
--
and
I
was
careful
almost
never
to
be
out
*NL*
of
it
--
I
could
follow
no
scent
very
far
.
We
lived
in
a
cloud
of
music
*NL*
and
love
and
success
and
private
theatricals
.
The
musical
sense
in
each
*NL*
of
the
children
was
of
the
quickest
,
but
the
elder
in
especial
had
a
*NL*
marvelous
knack
of
catching
and
repeating
.
The
schoolroom
piano
*NL*
broke
into
all
gruesome
fancies
;
and
when
that
failed
there
were
*NL*
confabulations
in
corners
,
with
a
sequel
of
one
of
them
going
out
in
*NL*
the
highest
spirits
in
order
to
``
come
in
''
as
something
new
.
I
had
had
*NL*
brothers
myself
,
and
it
was
no
revelation
to
me
that
little
girls
could
*NL*
be
slavish
idolaters
of
little
boys
.
What
surpassed
everything
was
that
*NL*
there
was
a
little
boy
in
the
world
who
could
have
for
the
inferior
age
,
*NL*
sex
,
and
intelligence
so
fine
a
consideration
.
They
were
extraordinarily
*NL*
at
one
,
and
to
say
that
they
never
either
quarreled
or
complained
is
*NL*
to
make
the
note
of
praise
coarse
for
their
quality
of
sweetness
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
when
I
dropped
into
coarseness
,
I
perhaps
came
across
*NL*
traces
of
little
understandings
between
them
by
which
one
of
them
should
*NL*
keep
me
occupied
while
the
other
slipped
away
.
There
is
a
naive
side
,
*NL*
I
suppose
,
in
all
diplomacy
;
but
if
my
pupils
practiced
upon
me
,
it
was
*NL*
surely
with
the
minimum
of
grossness
.
It
was
all
in
the
other
quarter
*NL*
that
,
after
a
lull
,
the
grossness
broke
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
find
that
I
really
hang
back
;
but
I
must
take
my
plunge
.
In
going
on
*NL*
with
the
record
of
what
was
hideous
at
Bly
,
I
not
only
challenge
the
*NL*
most
liberal
faith
--
for
which
I
little
care
;
but
--
and
this
is
another
*NL*
matter
--
I
renew
what
I
myself
suffered
,
I
again
push
my
way
through
it
*NL*
to
the
end
.
There
came
suddenly
an
hour
after
which
,
as
I
look
back
,
the
*NL*
affair
seems
to
me
to
have
been
all
pure
suffering
;
but
I
have
at
least
*NL*
reached
the
heart
of
it
,
and
the
straightest
road
out
is
doubtless
to
*NL*
advance
.
One
evening
--
with
nothing
to
lead
up
or
to
prepare
it
--
I
felt
*NL*
the
cold
touch
of
the
impression
that
had
breathed
on
me
the
night
of
*NL*
my
arrival
and
which
,
much
lighter
then
,
as
I
have
mentioned
,
I
should
*NL*
probably
have
made
little
of
in
memory
had
my
subsequent
sojourn
been
*NL*
less
agitated
.
I
had
not
gone
to
bed
;
I
sat
reading
by
a
couple
of
*NL*
candles
.
There
was
a
roomful
of
old
books
at
Bly
--
last-century
fiction
,
*NL*
some
of
it
,
which
,
to
the
extent
of
a
distinctly
deprecated
renown
,
*NL*
but
never
to
so
much
as
that
of
a
stray
specimen
,
had
reached
the
*NL*
sequestered
home
and
appealed
to
the
unavowed
curiosity
of
my
youth
.
I
*NL*
remember
that
the
book
I
had
in
my
hand
was
Fielding
's
Amelia
;
also
that
*NL*
I
was
wholly
awake
.
I
recall
further
both
a
general
conviction
that
it
*NL*
was
horribly
late
and
a
particular
objection
to
looking
at
my
watch
.
I
*NL*
figure
,
finally
,
that
the
white
curtain
draping
,
in
the
fashion
of
those
*NL*
days
,
the
head
of
Flora
's
little
bed
,
shrouded
,
as
I
had
assured
myself
*NL*
long
before
,
the
perfection
of
childish
rest
.
I
recollect
in
short
that
,
*NL*
though
I
was
deeply
interested
in
my
author
,
I
found
myself
,
at
the
turn
*NL*
of
a
page
and
with
his
spell
all
scattered
,
looking
straight
up
from
*NL*
him
and
hard
at
the
door
of
my
room
.
There
was
a
moment
during
which
*NL*
I
listened
,
reminded
of
the
faint
sense
I
had
had
,
the
first
night
,
of
*NL*
there
being
something
undefinably
astir
in
the
house
,
and
noted
the
soft
*NL*
breath
of
the
open
casement
just
move
the
half-drawn
blind
.
Then
,
with
*NL*
all
the
marks
of
a
deliberation
that
must
have
seemed
magnificent
had
*NL*
there
been
anyone
to
admire
it
,
I
laid
down
my
book
,
rose
to
my
feet
,
*NL*
and
,
taking
a
candle
,
went
straight
out
of
the
room
and
,
from
the
*NL*
passage
,
on
which
my
light
made
little
impression
,
noiselessly
closed
*NL*
and
locked
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
say
now
neither
what
determined
nor
what
guided
me
,
but
I
went
*NL*
straight
along
the
lobby
,
holding
my
candle
high
,
till
I
came
within
*NL*
sight
of
the
tall
window
that
presided
over
the
great
turn
of
the
*NL*
staircase
.
At
this
point
I
precipitately
found
myself
aware
of
three
*NL*
things
.
They
were
practically
simultaneous
,
yet
they
had
flashes
of
*NL*
succession
.
My
candle
,
under
a
bold
flourish
,
went
out
,
and
I
perceived
,
*NL*
by
the
uncovered
window
,
that
the
yielding
dusk
of
earliest
morning
*NL*
rendered
it
unnecessary
.
Without
it
,
the
next
instant
,
I
saw
that
there
*NL*
was
someone
on
the
stair
.
I
speak
of
sequences
,
but
I
required
no
lapse
*NL*
of
seconds
to
stiffen
myself
for
a
third
encounter
with
Quint
.
The
*NL*
apparition
had
reached
the
landing
halfway
up
and
was
therefore
on
the
*NL*
spot
nearest
the
window
,
where
at
sight
of
me
,
it
stopped
short
and
*NL*
fixed
me
exactly
as
it
had
fixed
me
from
the
tower
and
from
the
garden
.
*NL*
He
knew
me
as
well
as
I
knew
him
;
and
so
,
in
the
cold
,
faint
twilight
,
*NL*
with
a
glimmer
in
the
high
glass
and
another
on
the
polish
of
the
*NL*
oak
stair
below
,
we
faced
each
other
in
our
common
intensity
.
He
was
*NL*
absolutely
,
on
this
occasion
,
a
living
,
detestable
,
dangerous
presence
.
*NL*
But
that
was
not
the
wonder
of
wonders
;
I
reserve
this
distinction
for
*NL*
quite
another
circumstance
:
the
circumstance
that
dread
had
unmistakably
*NL*
quitted
me
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
me
there
that
did
n't
meet
and
*NL*
measure
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
plenty
of
anguish
after
that
extraordinary
moment
,
but
I
had
,
*NL*
thank
God
,
no
terror
.
And
he
knew
I
had
not
--
I
found
myself
at
the
end
*NL*
of
an
instant
magnificently
aware
of
this
.
I
felt
,
in
a
fierce
rigor
of
*NL*
confidence
,
that
if
I
stood
my
ground
a
minute
I
should
cease
--
for
*NL*
the
time
,
at
least
--
to
have
him
to
reckon
with
;
and
during
the
minute
,
*NL*
accordingly
,
the
thing
was
as
human
and
hideous
as
a
real
interview
:
*NL*
hideous
just
because
it
WAS
human
,
as
human
as
to
have
met
alone
,
in
*NL*
the
small
hours
,
in
a
sleeping
house
,
some
enemy
,
some
adventurer
,
*NL*
some
criminal
.
It
was
the
dead
silence
of
our
long
gaze
at
such
close
*NL*
quarters
that
gave
the
whole
horror
,
huge
as
it
was
,
its
only
note
of
*NL*
the
unnatural
.
If
I
had
met
a
murderer
in
such
a
place
and
at
such
an
*NL*
hour
,
we
still
at
least
would
have
spoken
.
Something
would
have
passed
,
*NL*
in
life
,
between
us
;
if
nothing
had
passed
,
one
of
us
would
have
moved
.
*NL*
The
moment
was
so
prolonged
that
it
would
have
taken
but
little
more
to
*NL*
make
me
doubt
if
even
_
I
_
were
in
life
.
I
ca
n't
express
what
followed
it
*NL*
save
by
saying
that
the
silence
itself
--
which
was
indeed
in
a
manner
*NL*
an
attestation
of
my
strength
--
became
the
element
into
which
I
saw
the
*NL*
figure
disappear
;
in
which
I
definitely
saw
it
turn
as
I
might
have
*NL*
seen
the
low
wretch
to
which
it
had
once
belonged
turn
on
receipt
of
an
*NL*
order
,
and
pass
,
with
my
eyes
on
the
villainous
back
that
no
hunch
could
*NL*
have
more
disfigured
,
straight
down
the
staircase
and
into
the
darkness
*NL*
in
which
the
next
bend
was
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
X
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
remained
awhile
at
the
top
of
the
stair
,
but
with
the
effect
presently
*NL*
of
understanding
that
when
my
visitor
had
gone
,
he
had
gone
:
then
I
*NL*
returned
to
my
room
.
The
foremost
thing
I
saw
there
by
the
light
of
the
*NL*
candle
I
had
left
burning
was
that
Flora
's
little
bed
was
empty
;
and
on
*NL*
this
I
caught
my
breath
with
all
the
terror
that
,
five
minutes
before
,
*NL*
I
had
been
able
to
resist
.
I
dashed
at
the
place
in
which
I
had
left
her
*NL*
lying
and
over
which
-LRB-
for
the
small
silk
counterpane
and
the
sheets
were
*NL*
disarranged
-RRB-
the
white
curtains
had
been
deceivingly
pulled
forward
;
*NL*
then
my
step
,
to
my
unutterable
relief
,
produced
an
answering
sound
:
I
*NL*
perceived
an
agitation
of
the
window
blind
,
and
the
child
,
ducking
down
,
*NL*
emerged
rosily
from
the
other
side
of
it
.
She
stood
there
in
so
much
of
*NL*
her
candor
and
so
little
of
her
nightgown
,
with
her
pink
bare
feet
and
*NL*
the
golden
glow
of
her
curls
.
She
looked
intensely
grave
,
and
I
had
*NL*
never
had
such
a
sense
of
losing
an
advantage
acquired
-LRB-
the
thrill
*NL*
of
which
had
just
been
so
prodigious
-RRB-
as
on
my
consciousness
that
*NL*
she
addressed
me
with
a
reproach
.
``
You
naughty
:
where
HAVE
you
*NL*
been
?
''
--
instead
of
challenging
her
own
irregularity
I
found
myself
*NL*
arraigned
and
explaining
.
She
herself
explained
,
for
that
matter
,
with
*NL*
the
loveliest
,
eagerest
simplicity
.
She
had
known
suddenly
,
as
she
lay
*NL*
there
,
that
I
was
out
of
the
room
,
and
had
jumped
up
to
see
what
had
*NL*
become
of
me
.
I
had
dropped
,
with
the
joy
of
her
reappearance
,
back
*NL*
into
my
chair
--
feeling
then
,
and
then
only
,
a
little
faint
;
and
she
had
*NL*
pattered
straight
over
to
me
,
thrown
herself
upon
my
knee
,
given
herself
*NL*
to
be
held
with
the
flame
of
the
candle
full
in
the
wonderful
little
*NL*
face
that
was
still
flushed
with
sleep
.
I
remember
closing
my
eyes
an
*NL*
instant
,
yieldingly
,
consciously
,
as
before
the
excess
of
something
*NL*
beautiful
that
shone
out
of
the
blue
of
her
own
.
``
You
were
looking
for
*NL*
me
out
of
the
window
?
''
I
said
.
``
You
thought
I
might
be
walking
in
the
*NL*
grounds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
I
thought
someone
was
''
--
she
never
blanched
as
she
*NL*
smiled
out
that
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
how
I
looked
at
her
now
!
``
And
did
you
see
anyone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
NO
!
''
she
returned
,
almost
with
the
full
privilege
of
childish
*NL*
inconsequence
,
resentfully
,
though
with
a
long
sweetness
in
her
little
*NL*
drawl
of
the
negative
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
in
the
state
of
my
nerves
,
I
absolutely
believed
she
*NL*
lied
;
and
if
I
once
more
closed
my
eyes
it
was
before
the
dazzle
of
the
*NL*
three
or
four
possible
ways
in
which
I
might
take
this
up
.
One
of
these
,
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
tempted
me
with
such
singular
intensity
that
,
to
withstand
*NL*
it
,
I
must
have
gripped
my
little
girl
with
a
spasm
that
,
wonderfully
,
*NL*
she
submitted
to
without
a
cry
or
a
sign
of
fright
.
Why
not
break
out
*NL*
at
her
on
the
spot
and
have
it
all
over
?
--
give
it
to
her
straight
in
her
*NL*
lovely
little
lighted
face
?
``
You
see
,
you
see
,
you
KNOW
that
you
do
and
*NL*
that
you
already
quite
suspect
I
believe
it
;
therefore
,
why
not
frankly
*NL*
confess
it
to
me
,
so
that
we
may
at
least
live
with
it
together
and
*NL*
learn
perhaps
,
in
the
strangeness
of
our
fate
,
where
we
are
and
what
*NL*
it
means
?
''
This
solicitation
dropped
,
alas
,
as
it
came
:
if
I
could
*NL*
immediately
have
succumbed
to
it
I
might
have
spared
myself
--
well
,
*NL*
you
'll
see
what
.
Instead
of
succumbing
I
sprang
again
to
my
feet
,
*NL*
looked
at
her
bed
,
and
took
a
helpless
middle
way
.
``
Why
did
you
pull
the
*NL*
curtain
over
the
place
to
make
me
think
you
were
still
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Flora
luminously
considered
;
after
which
,
with
her
little
divine
smile
:
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
n't
like
to
frighten
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
had
,
by
your
idea
,
gone
out
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
absolutely
declined
to
be
puzzled
;
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
flame
*NL*
of
the
candle
as
if
the
question
were
as
irrelevant
,
or
at
any
rate
as
*NL*
impersonal
,
as
Mrs.
Marcet
or
nine-times-nine
.
``
Oh
,
but
you
know
,
''
she
*NL*
quite
adequately
answered
,
``
that
you
might
come
back
,
you
dear
,
and
that
*NL*
you
HAVE
!
''
And
after
a
little
,
when
she
had
got
into
bed
,
I
had
,
for
a
*NL*
long
time
,
by
almost
sitting
on
her
to
hold
her
hand
,
to
prove
that
I
*NL*
recognized
the
pertinence
of
my
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
imagine
the
general
complexion
,
from
that
moment
,
of
my
nights
.
*NL*
I
repeatedly
sat
up
till
I
did
n't
know
when
;
I
selected
moments
when
my
*NL*
roommate
unmistakably
slept
,
and
,
stealing
out
,
took
noiseless
turns
in
*NL*
the
passage
and
even
pushed
as
far
as
to
where
I
had
last
met
Quint
.
But
*NL*
I
never
met
him
there
again
;
and
I
may
as
well
say
at
once
that
I
on
no
*NL*
other
occasion
saw
him
in
the
house
.
I
just
missed
,
on
the
staircase
,
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
,
a
different
adventure
.
Looking
down
it
from
the
top
I
*NL*
once
recognized
the
presence
of
a
woman
seated
on
one
of
the
lower
steps
*NL*
with
her
back
presented
to
me
,
her
body
half-bowed
and
her
head
,
in
an
*NL*
attitude
of
woe
,
in
her
hands
.
I
had
been
there
but
an
instant
,
however
,
*NL*
when
she
vanished
without
looking
round
at
me
.
I
knew
,
nonetheless
,
*NL*
exactly
what
dreadful
face
she
had
to
show
;
and
I
wondered
whether
,
if
*NL*
instead
of
being
above
I
had
been
below
,
I
should
have
had
,
for
going
*NL*
up
,
the
same
nerve
I
had
lately
shown
Quint
.
Well
,
there
continued
to
*NL*
be
plenty
of
chance
for
nerve
.
On
the
eleventh
night
after
my
latest
*NL*
encounter
with
that
gentleman
--
they
were
all
numbered
now
--
I
had
an
*NL*
alarm
that
perilously
skirted
it
and
that
indeed
,
from
the
particular
*NL*
quality
of
its
unexpectedness
,
proved
quite
my
sharpest
shock
.
It
was
*NL*
precisely
the
first
night
during
this
series
that
,
weary
with
watching
,
*NL*
I
had
felt
that
I
might
again
without
laxity
lay
myself
down
at
my
*NL*
old
hour
.
I
slept
immediately
and
,
as
I
afterward
knew
,
till
about
one
*NL*
o'clock
;
but
when
I
woke
it
was
to
sit
straight
up
,
as
completely
roused
*NL*
as
if
a
hand
had
shook
me
.
I
had
left
a
light
burning
,
but
it
was
now
*NL*
out
,
and
I
felt
an
instant
certainty
that
Flora
had
extinguished
it
.
*NL*
This
brought
me
to
my
feet
and
straight
,
in
the
darkness
,
to
her
bed
,
*NL*
which
I
found
she
had
left
.
A
glance
at
the
window
enlightened
me
*NL*
further
,
and
the
striking
of
a
match
completed
the
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
had
again
got
up
--
this
time
blowing
out
the
taper
,
and
had
*NL*
again
,
for
some
purpose
of
observation
or
response
,
squeezed
in
behind
*NL*
the
blind
and
was
peering
out
into
the
night
.
That
she
now
saw
--
as
she
*NL*
had
not
,
I
had
satisfied
myself
,
the
previous
time
--
was
proved
to
me
by
*NL*
the
fact
that
she
was
disturbed
neither
by
my
reillumination
nor
by
the
*NL*
haste
I
made
to
get
into
slippers
and
into
a
wrap
.
Hidden
,
protected
,
*NL*
absorbed
,
she
evidently
rested
on
the
sill
--
the
casement
opened
*NL*
forward
--
and
gave
herself
up
.
There
was
a
great
still
moon
to
help
her
,
*NL*
and
this
fact
had
counted
in
my
quick
decision
.
She
was
face
to
face
*NL*
with
the
apparition
we
had
met
at
the
lake
,
and
could
now
communicate
*NL*
with
it
as
she
had
not
then
been
able
to
do
.
What
I
,
on
my
side
,
had
to
*NL*
care
for
was
,
without
disturbing
her
,
to
reach
,
from
the
corridor
,
some
*NL*
other
window
in
the
same
quarter
.
I
got
to
the
door
without
her
hearing
*NL*
me
;
I
got
out
of
it
,
closed
it
,
and
listened
,
from
the
other
side
,
for
*NL*
some
sound
from
her
.
While
I
stood
in
the
passage
I
had
my
eyes
on
her
*NL*
brother
's
door
,
which
was
but
ten
steps
off
and
which
,
indescribably
,
*NL*
produced
in
me
a
renewal
of
the
strange
impulse
that
I
lately
spoke
*NL*
of
as
my
temptation
.
What
if
I
should
go
straight
in
and
march
to
HIS
*NL*
window
?
--
what
if
,
by
risking
to
his
boyish
bewilderment
a
revelation
of
*NL*
my
motive
,
I
should
throw
across
the
rest
of
the
mystery
the
long
halter
*NL*
of
my
boldness
?
*NL*
*NL*
This
thought
held
me
sufficiently
to
make
me
cross
to
his
threshold
and
*NL*
pause
again
.
I
preternaturally
listened
;
I
figured
to
myself
what
might
*NL*
portentously
be
;
I
wondered
if
his
bed
were
also
empty
and
he
too
were
*NL*
secretly
at
watch
.
It
was
a
deep
,
soundless
minute
,
at
the
end
of
which
*NL*
my
impulse
failed
.
He
was
quiet
;
he
might
be
innocent
;
the
risk
was
*NL*
hideous
;
I
turned
away
.
There
was
a
figure
in
the
grounds
--
a
figure
*NL*
prowling
for
a
sight
,
the
visitor
with
whom
Flora
was
engaged
;
but
it
*NL*
was
not
the
visitor
most
concerned
with
my
boy
.
I
hesitated
afresh
,
but
*NL*
on
other
grounds
and
only
for
a
few
seconds
;
then
I
had
made
my
choice
.
*NL*
There
were
empty
rooms
at
Bly
,
and
it
was
only
a
question
of
choosing
*NL*
the
right
one
.
The
right
one
suddenly
presented
itself
to
me
as
the
*NL*
lower
one
--
though
high
above
the
gardens
--
in
the
solid
corner
of
the
*NL*
house
that
I
have
spoken
of
as
the
old
tower
.
This
was
a
large
,
square
*NL*
chamber
,
arranged
with
some
state
as
a
bedroom
,
the
extravagant
size
of
*NL*
which
made
it
so
inconvenient
that
it
had
not
for
years
,
though
kept
by
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
in
exemplary
order
,
been
occupied
.
I
had
often
admired
it
and
*NL*
I
knew
my
way
about
in
it
;
I
had
only
,
after
just
faltering
at
the
first
*NL*
chill
gloom
of
its
disuse
,
to
pass
across
it
and
unbolt
as
quietly
as
I
*NL*
could
one
of
the
shutters
.
Achieving
this
transit
,
I
uncovered
the
*NL*
glass
without
a
sound
and
,
applying
my
face
to
the
pane
,
was
able
,
the
*NL*
darkness
without
being
much
less
than
within
,
to
see
that
I
commanded
*NL*
the
right
direction
.
Then
I
saw
something
more
.
The
moon
made
the
*NL*
night
extraordinarily
penetrable
and
showed
me
on
the
lawn
a
person
,
*NL*
diminished
by
distance
,
who
stood
there
motionless
and
as
if
fascinated
,
*NL*
looking
up
to
where
I
had
appeared
--
looking
,
that
is
,
not
so
much
*NL*
straight
at
me
as
at
something
that
was
apparently
above
me
.
There
was
*NL*
clearly
another
person
above
me
--
there
was
a
person
on
the
tower
;
but
*NL*
the
presence
on
the
lawn
was
not
in
the
least
what
I
had
conceived
and
*NL*
had
confidently
hurried
to
meet
.
The
presence
on
the
lawn
--
I
felt
sick
*NL*
as
I
made
it
out
--
was
poor
little
Miles
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
late
next
day
that
I
spoke
to
Mrs.
Grose
;
the
rigor
with
*NL*
which
I
kept
my
pupils
in
sight
making
it
often
difficult
to
meet
*NL*
her
privately
,
and
the
more
as
we
each
felt
the
importance
of
not
*NL*
provoking
--
on
the
part
of
the
servants
quite
as
much
as
on
that
of
the
*NL*
children
--
any
suspicion
of
a
secret
flurry
or
that
of
a
discussion
of
*NL*
mysteries
.
I
drew
a
great
security
in
this
particular
from
her
mere
*NL*
smooth
aspect
.
There
was
nothing
in
her
fresh
face
to
pass
on
to
others
*NL*
my
horrible
confidences
.
She
believed
me
,
I
was
sure
,
absolutely
:
if
she
*NL*
had
n't
I
do
n't
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
,
for
I
could
n't
have
*NL*
borne
the
business
alone
.
But
she
was
a
magnificent
monument
to
the
*NL*
blessing
of
a
want
of
imagination
,
and
if
she
could
see
in
our
little
*NL*
charges
nothing
but
their
beauty
and
amiability
,
their
happiness
and
*NL*
cleverness
,
she
had
no
direct
communication
with
the
sources
of
my
*NL*
trouble
.
If
they
had
been
at
all
visibly
blighted
or
battered
,
she
would
*NL*
doubtless
have
grown
,
on
tracing
it
back
,
haggard
enough
to
match
them
;
*NL*
as
matters
stood
,
however
,
I
could
feel
her
,
when
she
surveyed
them
,
*NL*
with
her
large
white
arms
folded
and
the
habit
of
serenity
in
all
her
*NL*
look
,
thank
the
Lord
's
mercy
that
if
they
were
ruined
the
pieces
would
*NL*
still
serve
.
Flights
of
fancy
gave
place
,
in
her
mind
,
to
a
steady
*NL*
fireside
glow
,
and
I
had
already
begun
to
perceive
how
,
with
the
*NL*
development
of
the
conviction
that
--
as
time
went
on
without
a
public
*NL*
accident
--
our
young
things
could
,
after
all
,
look
out
for
themselves
,
*NL*
she
addressed
her
greatest
solicitude
to
the
sad
case
presented
by
their
*NL*
instructress
.
That
,
for
myself
,
was
a
sound
simplification
:
I
could
*NL*
engage
that
,
to
the
world
,
my
face
should
tell
no
tales
,
but
it
would
*NL*
have
been
,
in
the
conditions
,
an
immense
added
strain
to
find
myself
*NL*
anxious
about
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
hour
I
now
speak
of
she
had
joined
me
,
under
pressure
,
on
the
*NL*
terrace
,
where
,
with
the
lapse
of
the
season
,
the
afternoon
sun
was
now
*NL*
agreeable
;
and
we
sat
there
together
while
,
before
us
,
at
a
distance
,
*NL*
but
within
call
if
we
wished
,
the
children
strolled
to
and
fro
in
one
*NL*
of
their
most
manageable
moods
.
They
moved
slowly
,
in
unison
,
below
us
,
*NL*
over
the
lawn
,
the
boy
,
as
they
went
,
reading
aloud
from
a
storybook
and
*NL*
passing
his
arm
round
his
sister
to
keep
her
quite
in
touch
.
Mrs.
Grose
*NL*
watched
them
with
positive
placidity
;
then
I
caught
the
suppressed
*NL*
intellectual
creak
with
which
she
conscientiously
turned
to
take
from
me
*NL*
a
view
of
the
back
of
the
tapestry
.
I
had
made
her
a
receptacle
of
*NL*
lurid
things
,
but
there
was
an
odd
recognition
of
my
superiority
--
my
*NL*
accomplishments
and
my
function
--
in
her
patience
under
my
pain
.
She
*NL*
offered
her
mind
to
my
disclosures
as
,
had
I
wished
to
mix
a
witch
's
*NL*
broth
and
proposed
it
with
assurance
,
she
would
have
held
out
a
large
*NL*
clean
saucepan
.
This
had
become
thoroughly
her
attitude
by
the
time
*NL*
that
,
in
my
recital
of
the
events
of
the
night
,
I
reached
the
point
of
*NL*
what
Miles
had
said
to
me
when
,
after
seeing
him
,
at
such
a
monstrous
*NL*
hour
,
almost
on
the
very
spot
where
he
happened
now
to
be
,
I
had
gone
*NL*
down
to
bring
him
in
;
choosing
then
,
at
the
window
,
with
a
concentrated
*NL*
need
of
not
alarming
the
house
,
rather
that
method
than
a
signal
more
*NL*
resonant
.
I
had
left
her
meanwhile
in
little
doubt
of
my
small
hope
of
*NL*
representing
with
success
even
to
her
actual
sympathy
my
sense
of
the
*NL*
real
splendor
of
the
little
inspiration
with
which
,
after
I
had
got
him
*NL*
into
the
house
,
the
boy
met
my
final
articulate
challenge
.
As
soon
as
I
*NL*
appeared
in
the
moonlight
on
the
terrace
,
he
had
come
to
me
as
straight
*NL*
as
possible
;
on
which
I
had
taken
his
hand
without
a
word
and
led
him
,
*NL*
through
the
dark
spaces
,
up
the
staircase
where
Quint
had
so
hungrily
*NL*
hovered
for
him
,
along
the
lobby
where
I
had
listened
and
trembled
,
and
*NL*
so
to
his
forsaken
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
sound
,
on
the
way
,
had
passed
between
us
,
and
I
had
wondered
--
oh
,
*NL*
HOW
I
had
wondered
!
--
if
he
were
groping
about
in
his
little
mind
for
*NL*
something
plausible
and
not
too
grotesque
.
It
would
tax
his
invention
,
*NL*
certainly
,
and
I
felt
,
this
time
,
over
his
real
embarrassment
,
a
curious
*NL*
thrill
of
triumph
.
It
was
a
sharp
trap
for
the
inscrutable
!
He
could
n't
*NL*
play
any
longer
at
innocence
;
so
how
the
deuce
would
he
get
out
of
it
?
*NL*
There
beat
in
me
indeed
,
with
the
passionate
throb
of
this
question
an
*NL*
equal
dumb
appeal
as
to
how
the
deuce
_
I
_
should
.
I
was
confronted
at
*NL*
last
,
as
never
yet
,
with
all
the
risk
attached
even
now
to
sounding
my
*NL*
own
horrid
note
.
I
remember
in
fact
that
as
we
pushed
into
his
little
*NL*
chamber
,
where
the
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
at
all
and
the
window
,
*NL*
uncovered
to
the
moonlight
,
made
the
place
so
clear
that
there
was
no
*NL*
need
of
striking
a
match
--
I
remember
how
I
suddenly
dropped
,
sank
upon
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
bed
from
the
force
of
the
idea
that
he
must
know
how
he
*NL*
really
,
as
they
say
,
``
had
''
me
.
He
could
do
what
he
liked
,
with
all
his
*NL*
cleverness
to
help
him
,
so
long
as
I
should
continue
to
defer
to
the
*NL*
old
tradition
of
the
criminality
of
those
caretakers
of
the
young
who
*NL*
minister
to
superstitions
and
fears
.
He
``
had
''
me
indeed
,
and
in
a
cleft
*NL*
stick
;
for
who
would
ever
absolve
me
,
who
would
consent
that
I
should
go
*NL*
unhung
,
if
,
by
the
faintest
tremor
of
an
overture
,
I
were
the
first
to
*NL*
introduce
into
our
perfect
intercourse
an
element
so
dire
?
No
,
no
:
it
*NL*
was
useless
to
attempt
to
convey
to
Mrs.
Grose
,
just
as
it
is
scarcely
*NL*
less
so
to
attempt
to
suggest
here
,
how
,
in
our
short
,
stiff
brush
in
*NL*
the
dark
,
he
fairly
shook
me
with
admiration
.
I
was
of
course
thoroughly
*NL*
kind
and
merciful
;
never
,
never
yet
had
I
placed
on
his
little
shoulders
*NL*
hands
of
such
tenderness
as
those
with
which
,
while
I
rested
against
the
*NL*
bed
,
I
held
him
there
well
under
fire
.
I
had
no
alternative
but
,
in
form
*NL*
at
least
,
to
put
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
tell
me
now
--
and
all
the
truth
.
What
did
you
go
out
for
?
What
*NL*
were
you
doing
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
still
see
his
wonderful
smile
,
the
whites
of
his
beautiful
eyes
,
*NL*
and
the
uncovering
of
his
little
teeth
shine
to
me
in
the
dusk
.
``
If
I
*NL*
tell
you
why
,
will
you
understand
?
''
My
heart
,
at
this
,
leaped
into
my
*NL*
mouth
.
WOULD
he
tell
me
why
?
I
found
no
sound
on
my
lips
to
press
it
,
*NL*
and
I
was
aware
of
replying
only
with
a
vague
,
repeated
,
grimacing
nod
.
*NL*
He
was
gentleness
itself
,
and
while
I
wagged
my
head
at
him
he
stood
*NL*
there
more
than
ever
a
little
fairy
prince
.
It
was
his
brightness
indeed
*NL*
that
gave
me
a
respite
.
Would
it
be
so
great
if
he
were
really
going
to
*NL*
tell
me
?
``
Well
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
just
exactly
in
order
that
you
should
*NL*
do
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
me
--
for
a
change
--
BAD
!
''
I
shall
never
forget
the
sweetness
and
*NL*
gaiety
with
which
he
brought
out
the
word
,
nor
how
,
on
top
of
it
,
he
*NL*
bent
forward
and
kissed
me
.
It
was
practically
the
end
of
everything
.
*NL*
I
met
his
kiss
and
I
had
to
make
,
while
I
folded
him
for
a
minute
in
my
*NL*
arms
,
the
most
stupendous
effort
not
to
cry
.
He
had
given
exactly
the
*NL*
account
of
himself
that
permitted
least
of
my
going
behind
it
,
and
it
*NL*
was
only
with
the
effect
of
confirming
my
acceptance
of
it
that
,
as
I
*NL*
presently
glanced
about
the
room
,
I
could
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
did
n't
undress
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fairly
glittered
in
the
gloom
.
``
Not
at
all
.
I
sat
up
and
read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
did
you
go
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
midnight
.
When
I
'm
bad
I
AM
bad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
I
see
--
it
's
charming
.
But
how
could
you
be
sure
I
would
know
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
arranged
that
with
Flora
.
''
His
answers
rang
out
with
a
readiness
!
*NL*
``
She
was
to
get
up
and
look
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
is
what
she
did
do
.
''
It
was
I
who
fell
into
the
trap
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
disturbed
you
,
and
,
to
see
what
she
was
looking
at
,
you
also
*NL*
looked

you
saw
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
While
you
,
''
I
concurred
,
``
caught
your
death
in
the
night
air
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
literally
bloomed
so
from
this
exploit
that
he
could
afford
radiantly
*NL*
to
assent
.
``
How
otherwise
should
I
have
been
bad
enough
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
Then
,
after
another
embrace
,
the
incident
and
our
interview
closed
on
my
*NL*
recognition
of
all
the
reserves
of
goodness
that
,
for
his
joke
,
he
had
*NL*
been
able
to
draw
upon

The
particular
impression
I
had
received
proved
in
the
morning
light
,
*NL*
I
repeat
,
not
quite
successfully
presentable
to
Mrs.
Grose
,
though
I
*NL*
reinforced
it
with
the
mention
of
still
another
remark
that
he
had
made
*NL*
before
we
separated
.
``
It
all
lies
in
half
a
dozen
words
,
''
I
said
to
her
,
*NL*
``
words
that
really
settle
the
matter
.
`
Think
,
you
know
,
what
I
MIGHT
*NL*
do
!
'
He
threw
that
off
to
show
me
how
good
he
is
.
He
knows
down
to
*NL*
the
ground
what
he
`
might
'
do
.
That
's
what
he
gave
them
a
taste
of
at
*NL*
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
you
do
change
!
''
cried
my
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
change
--
I
simply
make
it
out

The
four

depend
upon
it

*NL*
perpetually
meet

If
on
either
of
these
last
nights
you
had
been
with
*NL*
either
child
,
you
would
clearly
have
understood
.
The
more
I
've
watched
*NL*
and
waited
the
more
I
've
felt
that
if
there
were
nothing
else
to
make
it
*NL*
sure
it
would
be
made
so
by
the
systematic
silence
of
each
.
NEVER
,
by
a
*NL*
slip
of
the
tongue
,
have
they
so
much
as
alluded
to
either
of
their
old
*NL*
friends
,
any
more
than
Miles
has
alluded
to
his
expulsion
.
Oh
,
yes
,
*NL*
we
may
sit
here
and
look
at
them
,
and
they
may
show
off
to
us
there
to
*NL*
their
fill
;
but
even
while
they
pretend
to
be
lost
in
their
fairytale
*NL*
they
're
steeped
in
their
vision
of
the
dead
restored
.
He
's
not
reading
*NL*
to
her
,
''
I
declared
;
``
they
're
talking
of
THEM
--
they
're
talking
horrors
!
*NL*
I
go
on
,
I
know
,
as
if
I
were
crazy
;
and
it
's
a
wonder
I
'm
not
.
What
*NL*
I
've
seen
would
have
made
YOU
so
;
but
it
has
only
made
me
more
lucid
,
*NL*
made
me
get
hold
of
still
other
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
lucidity
must
have
seemed
awful
,
but
the
charming
creatures
who
were
*NL*
victims
of
it
,
passing
and
repassing
in
their
interlocked
sweetness
,
*NL*
gave
my
colleague
something
to
hold
on
by
;
and
I
felt
how
tight
she
held
*NL*
as
,
without
stirring
in
the
breath
of
my
passion
,
she
covered
them
still
*NL*
with
her
eyes
.
``
Of
what
other
things
have
you
got
hold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
the
very
things
that
have
delighted
,
fascinated
,
and
yet
,
at
*NL*
bottom
,
as
I
now
so
strangely
see
,
mystified
and
troubled
me
.
Their
more
*NL*
than
earthly
beauty
,
their
absolutely
unnatural
goodness
.
It
's
a
game
,
''
*NL*
I
went
on
;
``
it
's
a
policy
and
a
fraud
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
part
of
little
darlings
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
yet
mere
lovely
babies
?
Yes
,
mad
as
that
seems
!
''
The
very
act
of
*NL*
bringing
it
out
really
helped
me
to
trace
it
--
follow
it
all
up
and
piece
*NL*
it
all
together
.
``
They
have
n't
been
good
--
they
've
only
been
absent
.
It
*NL*
has
been
easy
to
live
with
them
,
because
they
're
simply
leading
a
*NL*
life
of
their
own
.
They
're
not
mine
--
they
're
not
ours
.
They
're
his
and
*NL*
they
're
hers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quint
's
and
that
woman
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quint
's
and
that
woman
's
.
They
want
to
get
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
how
,
at
this
,
poor
Mrs.
Grose
appeared
to
study
them
!
``
But
for
*NL*
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
love
of
all
the
evil
that
,
in
those
dreadful
days
,
the
pair
put
*NL*
into
them
.
And
to
ply
them
with
that
evil
still
,
to
keep
up
the
work
of
*NL*
demons
,
is
what
brings
the
others
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laws
!
''
said
my
friend
under
her
breath
.
The
exclamation
was
homely
,
but
*NL*
it
revealed
a
real
acceptance
of
my
further
proof
of
what
,
in
the
bad
*NL*
time
--
for
there
had
been
a
worse
even
than
this
!
--
must
have
occurred
.
*NL*
There
could
have
been
no
such
justification
for
me
as
the
plain
assent
*NL*
of
her
experience
to
whatever
depth
of
depravity
I
found
credible
in
*NL*
our
brace
of
scoundrels
.
It
was
in
obvious
submission
of
memory
that
she
*NL*
brought
out
after
a
moment
:
``
They
WERE
rascals
!
But
what
can
they
now
*NL*
do
?
''
she
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
?
''
I
echoed
so
loud
that
Miles
and
Flora
,
as
they
passed
at
their
*NL*
distance
,
paused
an
instant
in
their
walk
and
looked
at
us
.
``
Do
n't
*NL*
they
do
enough
?
''
I
demanded
in
a
lower
tone
,
while
the
children
,
having
*NL*
smiled
and
nodded
and
kissed
hands
to
us
,
resumed
their
exhibition
.
We
*NL*
were
held
by
it
a
minute
;
then
I
answered
:
``
They
can
destroy
them
!
''
At
*NL*
this
my
companion
did
turn
,
but
the
inquiry
she
launched
was
a
silent
*NL*
one
,
the
effect
of
which
was
to
make
me
more
explicit
.
``
They
do
n't
know
,
*NL*
as
yet
,
quite
how
--
but
they
're
trying
hard
.
They
're
seen
only
across
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
and
beyond
--
in
strange
places
and
on
high
places
,
the
top
of
*NL*
towers
,
the
roof
of
houses
,
the
outside
of
windows
,
the
further
edge
*NL*
of
pools
;
but
there
's
a
deep
design
,
on
either
side
,
to
shorten
the
*NL*
distance
and
overcome
the
obstacle
;
and
the
success
of
the
tempters
is
*NL*
only
a
question
of
time
.
They
've
only
to
keep
to
their
suggestions
of
*NL*
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
children
to
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
perish
in
the
attempt
!
''
Mrs.
Grose
slowly
got
up
,
and
I
*NL*
scrupulously
added
:
``
Unless
,
of
course
,
we
can
prevent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Standing
there
before
me
while
I
kept
my
seat
,
she
visibly
turned
things
*NL*
over
.
``
Their
uncle
must
do
the
preventing
.
He
must
take
them
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
's
to
make
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
scanning
the
distance
,
but
she
now
dropped
on
me
a
foolish
*NL*
face
.
``
You
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
writing
to
him
that
his
house
is
poisoned
and
his
little
nephew
and
*NL*
niece
mad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
they
ARE
,
miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
I
am
myself
,
you
mean
?
That
's
charming
news
to
be
sent
him
by
a
*NL*
governess
whose
prime
undertaking
was
to
give
him
no
worry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
considered
,
following
the
children
again
.
``
Yes
,
he
do
hate
*NL*
worry
.
That
was
the
great
reason
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
those
fiends
took
him
in
so
long
?
No
doubt
,
though
his
indifference
*NL*
must
have
been
awful
.
As
I
'm
not
a
fiend
,
at
any
rate
,
I
should
n't
take
*NL*
him
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
companion
,
after
an
instant
and
for
all
answer
,
sat
down
again
and
*NL*
grasped
my
arm
.
``
Make
him
at
any
rate
come
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stared
.
``
To
ME
?
''
I
had
a
sudden
fear
of
what
she
might
do
.
''
`
Him
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ought
to
BE
here
--
he
ought
to
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
quickly
rose
,
and
I
think
I
must
have
shown
her
a
queerer
face
than
*NL*
ever
yet
.
``
You
see
me
asking
him
for
a
visit
?
''
No
,
with
her
eyes
on
*NL*
my
face
she
evidently
could
n't
.
Instead
of
it
even
--
as
a
woman
reads
*NL*
another
--
she
could
see
what
I
myself
saw
:
his
derision
,
his
amusement
,
*NL*
his
contempt
for
the
breakdown
of
my
resignation
at
being
left
alone
and
*NL*
for
the
fine
machinery
I
had
set
in
motion
to
attract
his
attention
to
*NL*
my
slighted
charms
.
She
did
n't
know
--
no
one
knew
--
how
proud
I
had
been
*NL*
to
serve
him
and
to
stick
to
our
terms
;
yet
she
nonetheless
took
the
*NL*
measure
,
I
think
,
of
the
warning
I
now
gave
her
.
``
If
you
should
so
lose
*NL*
your
head
as
to
appeal
to
him
for
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
really
frightened
.
``
Yes
,
miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
leave
,
on
the
spot
,
both
him
and
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
very
well
to
join
them
,
but
speaking
to
them
proved
quite
as
*NL*
much
as
ever
an
effort
beyond
my
strength
--
offered
,
in
close
quarters
,
*NL*
difficulties
as
insurmountable
as
before
.
This
situation
continued
a
*NL*
month
,
and
with
new
aggravations
and
particular
notes
,
the
note
above
*NL*
all
,
sharper
and
sharper
,
of
the
small
ironic
consciousness
on
the
part
*NL*
of
my
pupils
.
It
was
not
,
I
am
as
sure
today
as
I
was
sure
then
,
my
mere
*NL*
infernal
imagination
:
it
was
absolutely
traceable
that
they
were
aware
*NL*
of
my
predicament
and
that
this
strange
relation
made
,
in
a
manner
,
for
*NL*
a
long
time
,
the
air
in
which
we
moved
.
I
do
n't
mean
that
they
had
their
*NL*
tongues
in
their
cheeks
or
did
anything
vulgar
,
for
that
was
not
one
*NL*
of
their
dangers
:
I
do
mean
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
the
element
of
the
*NL*
unnamed
and
untouched
became
,
between
us
,
greater
than
any
other
,
and
*NL*
that
so
much
avoidance
could
not
have
been
so
successfully
effected
*NL*
without
a
great
deal
of
tacit
arrangement
.
It
was
as
if
,
at
moments
,
we
*NL*
were
perpetually
coming
into
sight
of
subjects
before
which
we
must
stop
*NL*
short
,
turning
suddenly
out
of
alleys
that
we
perceived
to
be
blind
,
*NL*
closing
with
a
little
bang
that
made
us
look
at
each
other
--
for
,
like
*NL*
all
bangs
,
it
was
something
louder
than
we
had
intended
--
the
doors
we
*NL*
had
indiscreetly
opened
.
All
roads
lead
to
Rome
,
and
there
were
times
*NL*
when
it
might
have
struck
us
that
almost
every
branch
of
study
or
*NL*
subject
of
conversation
skirted
forbidden
ground
.
Forbidden
ground
was
*NL*
the
question
of
the
return
of
the
dead
in
general
and
of
whatever
,
in
*NL*
especial
,
might
survive
,
in
memory
,
of
the
friends
little
children
had
*NL*
lost
.
There
were
days
when
I
could
have
sworn
that
one
of
them
had
,
with
*NL*
a
small
invisible
nudge
,
said
to
the
other
:
``
She
thinks
she
'll
do
it
*NL*
this
time
--
but
she
WO
N'T
!
''
To
``
do
it
''
would
have
been
to
indulge
for
*NL*
instance
--
and
for
once
in
a
way
--
in
some
direct
reference
to
the
lady
*NL*
who
had
prepared
them
for
my
discipline
.
They
had
a
delightful
endless
*NL*
appetite
for
passages
in
my
own
history
,
to
which
I
had
again
and
*NL*
again
treated
them
;
they
were
in
possession
of
everything
that
had
*NL*
ever
happened
to
me
,
had
had
,
with
every
circumstance
the
story
of
my
*NL*
smallest
adventures
and
of
those
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
and
of
the
*NL*
cat
and
the
dog
at
home
,
as
well
as
many
particulars
of
the
eccentric
*NL*
nature
of
my
father
,
of
the
furniture
and
arrangement
of
our
house
,
and
*NL*
of
the
conversation
of
the
old
women
of
our
village
.
There
were
things
*NL*
enough
,
taking
one
with
another
,
to
chatter
about
,
if
one
went
very
fast
*NL*
and
knew
by
instinct
when
to
go
round
.
They
pulled
with
an
art
of
their
*NL*
own
the
strings
of
my
invention
and
my
memory
;
and
nothing
else
perhaps
,
*NL*
when
I
thought
of
such
occasions
afterward
,
gave
me
so
the
suspicion
*NL*
of
being
watched
from
under
cover
.
It
was
in
any
case
over
MY
life
,
MY
*NL*
past
,
and
MY
friends
alone
that
we
could
take
anything
like
our
ease
--
a
*NL*
state
of
affairs
that
led
them
sometimes
without
the
least
pertinence
*NL*
to
break
out
into
sociable
reminders
.
I
was
invited
--
with
no
visible
*NL*
connection
--
to
repeat
afresh
Goody
Gosling
's
celebrated
mot
or
to
*NL*
confirm
the
details
already
supplied
as
to
the
cleverness
of
the
*NL*
vicarage
pony
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
partly
at
such
junctures
as
these
and
partly
at
quite
different
*NL*
ones
that
,
with
the
turn
my
matters
had
now
taken
,
my
predicament
,
as
I
*NL*
have
called
it
,
grew
most
sensible
.
The
fact
that
the
days
passed
for
*NL*
me
without
another
encounter
ought
,
it
would
have
appeared
,
to
have
done
*NL*
something
toward
soothing
my
nerves
.
Since
the
light
brush
,
that
second
*NL*
night
on
the
upper
landing
,
of
the
presence
of
a
woman
at
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
stair
,
I
had
seen
nothing
,
whether
in
or
out
of
the
house
,
that
one
*NL*
had
better
not
have
seen
.
There
was
many
a
corner
round
which
I
expected
*NL*
to
come
upon
Quint
,
and
many
a
situation
that
,
in
a
merely
sinister
way
,
*NL*
would
have
favored
the
appearance
of
Miss
Jessel
.
The
summer
had
turned
,
*NL*
the
summer
had
gone
;
the
autumn
had
dropped
upon
Bly
and
had
blown
out
*NL*
half
our
lights
.
The
place
,
with
its
gray
sky
and
withered
garlands
,
*NL*
its
bared
spaces
and
scattered
dead
leaves
,
was
like
a
theater
after
*NL*
the
performance
--
all
strewn
with
crumpled
playbills
.
There
were
exactly
*NL*
states
of
the
air
,
conditions
of
sound
and
of
stillness
,
unspeakable
*NL*
impressions
of
the
KIND
of
ministering
moment
,
that
brought
back
to
me
,
*NL*
long
enough
to
catch
it
,
the
feeling
of
the
medium
in
which
,
that
June
*NL*
evening
out
of
doors
,
I
had
had
my
first
sight
of
Quint
,
and
in
which
,
*NL*
too
,
at
those
other
instants
,
I
had
,
after
seeing
him
through
the
*NL*
window
,
looked
for
him
in
vain
in
the
circle
of
shrubbery
.
I
recognized
*NL*
the
signs
,
the
portents
--
I
recognized
the
moment
,
the
spot
.
But
they
*NL*
remained
unaccompanied
and
empty
,
and
I
continued
unmolested
;
if
*NL*
unmolested
one
could
call
a
young
woman
whose
sensibility
had
,
in
the
*NL*
most
extraordinary
fashion
,
not
declined
but
deepened
.
I
had
said
in
my
*NL*
talk
with
Mrs.
Grose
on
that
horrid
scene
of
Flora
's
by
the
lake
--
and
*NL*
had
perplexed
her
by
so
saying
--
that
it
would
from
that
moment
distress
*NL*
me
much
more
to
lose
my
power
than
to
keep
it
.
I
had
then
expressed
what
*NL*
was
vividly
in
my
mind
:
the
truth
that
,
whether
the
children
really
*NL*
saw
or
not
--
since
,
that
is
,
it
was
not
yet
definitely
proved
--
I
greatly
*NL*
preferred
,
as
a
safeguard
,
the
fullness
of
my
own
exposure
.
I
was
ready
*NL*
to
know
the
very
worst
that
was
to
be
known
.
What
I
had
then
had
an
ugly
*NL*
glimpse
of
was
that
my
eyes
might
be
sealed
just
while
theirs
were
*NL*
most
opened
.
Well
,
my
eyes
WERE
sealed
,
it
appeared
,
at
present
--
a
*NL*
consummation
for
which
it
seemed
blasphemous
not
to
thank
God
.
There
*NL*
was
,
alas
,
a
difficulty
about
that
:
I
would
have
thanked
him
with
all
*NL*
my
soul
had
I
not
had
in
a
proportionate
measure
this
conviction
of
the
*NL*
secret
of
my
pupils
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
can
I
retrace
today
the
strange
steps
of
my
obsession
?
There
were
*NL*
times
of
our
being
together
when
I
would
have
been
ready
to
swear
that
,
*NL*
literally
,
in
my
presence
,
but
with
my
direct
sense
of
it
closed
,
they
*NL*
had
visitors
who
were
known
and
were
welcome
.
Then
it
was
that
,
had
I
*NL*
not
been
deterred
by
the
very
chance
that
such
an
injury
might
prove
*NL*
greater
than
the
injury
to
be
averted
,
my
exultation
would
have
broken
*NL*
out
.
``
They
're
here
,
they
're
here
,
you
little
wretches
,
''
I
would
have
*NL*
cried
,
``
and
you
ca
n't
deny
it
now
!
''
The
little
wretches
denied
it
with
*NL*
all
the
added
volume
of
their
sociability
and
their
tenderness
,
in
just
*NL*
the
crystal
depths
of
which
--
like
the
flash
of
a
fish
in
a
stream
--
the
*NL*
mockery
of
their
advantage
peeped
up
.
The
shock
,
in
truth
,
had
sunk
into
*NL*
me
still
deeper
than
I
knew
on
the
night
when
,
looking
out
to
see
either
*NL*
Quint
or
Miss
Jessel
under
the
stars
,
I
had
beheld
the
boy
over
*NL*
whose
rest
I
watched
and
who
had
immediately
brought
in
with
him
--
had
*NL*
straightway
,
there
,
turned
it
on
me
--
the
lovely
upward
look
with
which
,
*NL*
from
the
battlements
above
me
,
the
hideous
apparition
of
Quint
had
*NL*
played
.
If
it
was
a
question
of
a
scare
,
my
discovery
on
this
occasion
*NL*
had
scared
me
more
than
any
other
,
and
it
was
in
the
condition
of
nerves
*NL*
produced
by
it
that
I
made
my
actual
inductions
.
They
harassed
me
so
*NL*
that
sometimes
,
at
odd
moments
,
I
shut
myself
up
audibly
to
rehearse
--
it
*NL*
was
at
once
a
fantastic
relief
and
a
renewed
despair
--
the
manner
in
*NL*
which
I
might
come
to
the
point
.
I
approached
it
from
one
side
and
the
*NL*
other
while
,
in
my
room
,
I
flung
myself
about
,
but
I
always
broke
down
*NL*
in
the
monstrous
utterance
of
names
.
As
they
died
away
on
my
lips
,
I
*NL*
said
to
myself
that
I
should
indeed
help
them
to
represent
something
*NL*
infamous
,
if
,
by
pronouncing
them
,
I
should
violate
as
rare
a
little
*NL*
case
of
instinctive
delicacy
as
any
schoolroom
,
probably
,
had
ever
*NL*
known
.
When
I
said
to
myself
:
``
THEY
have
the
manners
to
be
silent
,
and
*NL*
you
,
trusted
as
you
are
,
the
baseness
to
speak
!
''
I
felt
myself
crimson
*NL*
and
I
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
.
After
these
secret
scenes
I
*NL*
chattered
more
than
ever
,
going
on
volubly
enough
till
one
of
our
*NL*
prodigious
,
palpable
hushes
occurred
--
I
can
call
them
nothing
else
--
the
*NL*
strange
,
dizzy
lift
or
swim
-LRB-
I
try
for
terms
!
-RRB-
into
a
stillness
,
a
pause
*NL*
of
all
life
,
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
more
or
less
noise
that
at
*NL*
the
moment
we
might
be
engaged
in
making
and
that
I
could
hear
through
*NL*
any
deepened
exhilaration
or
quickened
recitation
or
louder
strum
of
the
*NL*
piano
.
Then
it
was
that
the
others
,
the
outsiders
,
were
there
.
Though
*NL*
they
were
not
angels
,
they
``
passed
,
''
as
the
French
say
,
causing
me
,
*NL*
while
they
stayed
,
to
tremble
with
the
fear
of
their
addressing
to
their
*NL*
younger
victims
some
yet
more
infernal
message
or
more
vivid
image
than
*NL*
they
had
thought
good
enough
for
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
it
was
most
impossible
to
get
rid
of
was
the
cruel
idea
that
,
*NL*
whatever
I
had
seen
,
Miles
and
Flora
saw
MORE
--
things
terrible
and
*NL*
unguessable
and
that
sprang
from
dreadful
passages
of
intercourse
in
the
*NL*
past
.
Such
things
naturally
left
on
the
surface
,
for
the
time
,
a
chill
*NL*
which
we
vociferously
denied
that
we
felt
;
and
we
had
,
all
three
,
with
*NL*
repetition
,
got
into
such
splendid
training
that
we
went
,
each
time
,
*NL*
almost
automatically
,
to
mark
the
close
of
the
incident
,
through
the
*NL*
very
same
movements
.
It
was
striking
of
the
children
,
at
all
events
,
*NL*
to
kiss
me
inveterately
with
a
kind
of
wild
irrelevance
and
never
to
*NL*
fail
--
one
or
the
other
--
of
the
precious
question
that
had
helped
us
*NL*
through
many
a
peril
.
``
When
do
you
think
he
WILL
come
?
Do
n't
you
think
*NL*
we
OUGHT
to
write
?
''
--
there
was
nothing
like
that
inquiry
,
we
found
by
*NL*
experience
,
for
carrying
off
an
awkwardness
.
``
He
''
of
course
was
their
*NL*
uncle
in
Harley
Street
;
and
we
lived
in
much
profusion
of
theory
that
he
*NL*
might
at
any
moment
arrive
to
mingle
in
our
circle
.
It
was
impossible
to
*NL*
have
given
less
encouragement
than
he
had
done
to
such
a
doctrine
,
but
*NL*
if
we
had
not
had
the
doctrine
to
fall
back
upon
we
should
have
*NL*
deprived
each
other
of
some
of
our
finest
exhibitions
.
He
never
wrote
to
*NL*
them
--
that
may
have
been
selfish
,
but
it
was
a
part
of
the
flattery
of
*NL*
his
trust
of
me
;
for
the
way
in
which
a
man
pays
his
highest
tribute
to
*NL*
a
woman
is
apt
to
be
but
by
the
more
festal
celebration
of
one
of
the
*NL*
sacred
laws
of
his
comfort
;
and
I
held
that
I
carried
out
the
spirit
of
*NL*
the
pledge
given
not
to
appeal
to
him
when
I
let
my
charges
understand
*NL*
that
their
own
letters
were
but
charming
literary
exercises
.
They
were
*NL*
too
beautiful
to
be
posted
;
I
kept
them
myself
;
I
have
them
all
to
this
*NL*
hour
.
This
was
a
rule
indeed
which
only
added
to
the
satiric
effect
of
*NL*
my
being
plied
with
the
supposition
that
he
might
at
any
moment
be
among
*NL*
us
.
It
was
exactly
as
if
my
charges
knew
how
almost
more
awkward
than
*NL*
anything
else
that
might
be
for
me
.
There
appears
to
me
,
moreover
,
as
*NL*
I
look
back
,
no
note
in
all
this
more
extraordinary
than
the
mere
fact
*NL*
that
,
in
spite
of
my
tension
and
of
their
triumph
,
I
never
lost
patience
*NL*
with
them
.
Adorable
they
must
in
truth
have
been
,
I
now
reflect
,
that
I
*NL*
did
n't
in
these
days
hate
them
!
Would
exasperation
,
however
,
if
relief
*NL*
had
longer
been
postponed
,
finally
have
betrayed
me
?
It
little
matters
,
*NL*
for
relief
arrived
.
I
call
it
relief
,
though
it
was
only
the
relief
that
*NL*
a
snap
brings
to
a
strain
or
the
burst
of
a
thunderstorm
to
a
day
of
*NL*
suffocation
.
It
was
at
least
change
,
and
it
came
with
a
rush
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Walking
to
church
a
certain
Sunday
morning
,
I
had
little
Miles
at
my
*NL*
side
and
his
sister
,
in
advance
of
us
and
at
Mrs.
Grose
's
,
well
in
*NL*
sight
.
It
was
a
crisp
,
clear
day
,
the
first
of
its
order
for
some
time
;
*NL*
the
night
had
brought
a
touch
of
frost
,
and
the
autumn
air
,
bright
*NL*
and
sharp
,
made
the
church
bells
almost
gay
.
It
was
an
odd
accident
of
*NL*
thought
that
I
should
have
happened
at
such
a
moment
to
be
particularly
*NL*
and
very
gratefully
struck
with
the
obedience
of
my
little
charges
.
Why
*NL*
did
they
never
resent
my
inexorable
,
my
perpetual
society
?
Something
or
*NL*
other
had
brought
nearer
home
to
me
that
I
had
all
but
pinned
the
boy
to
*NL*
my
shawl
and
that
,
in
the
way
our
companions
were
marshaled
before
me
,
*NL*
I
might
have
appeared
to
provide
against
some
danger
of
rebellion
.
I
*NL*
was
like
a
gaoler
with
an
eye
to
possible
surprises
and
escapes
.
But
all
*NL*
this
belonged
--
I
mean
their
magnificent
little
surrender
--
just
to
the
*NL*
special
array
of
the
facts
that
were
most
abysmal
.
Turned
out
for
Sunday
*NL*
by
his
uncle
's
tailor
,
who
had
had
a
free
hand
and
a
notion
of
*NL*
pretty
waistcoats
and
of
his
grand
little
air
,
Miles
's
whole
title
to
*NL*
independence
,
the
rights
of
his
sex
and
situation
,
were
so
stamped
upon
*NL*
him
that
if
he
had
suddenly
struck
for
freedom
I
should
have
had
nothing
*NL*
to
say
.
I
was
by
the
strangest
of
chances
wondering
how
I
should
meet
*NL*
him
when
the
revolution
unmistakably
occurred
.
I
call
it
a
revolution
*NL*
because
I
now
see
how
,
with
the
word
he
spoke
,
the
curtain
rose
on
the
*NL*
last
act
of
my
dreadful
drama
,
and
the
catastrophe
was
precipitated
.
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
my
dear
,
you
know
,
''
he
charmingly
said
,
``
when
in
the
world
,
*NL*
please
,
am
I
going
back
to
school
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Transcribed
here
the
speech
sounds
harmless
enough
,
particularly
*NL*
as
uttered
in
the
sweet
,
high
,
casual
pipe
with
which
,
at
all
*NL*
interlocutors
,
but
above
all
at
his
eternal
governess
,
he
threw
off
*NL*
intonations
as
if
he
were
tossing
roses
.
There
was
something
in
*NL*
them
that
always
made
one
``
catch
,
''
and
I
caught
,
at
any
rate
,
now
so
*NL*
effectually
that
I
stopped
as
short
as
if
one
of
the
trees
of
the
*NL*
park
had
fallen
across
the
road
.
There
was
something
new
,
on
the
spot
,
*NL*
between
us
,
and
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
I
recognized
it
,
though
,
*NL*
to
enable
me
to
do
so
,
he
had
no
need
to
look
a
whit
less
candid
and
*NL*
charming
than
usual
.
I
could
feel
in
him
how
he
already
,
from
my
at
*NL*
first
finding
nothing
to
reply
,
perceived
the
advantage
he
had
gained
.
I
*NL*
was
so
slow
to
find
anything
that
he
had
plenty
of
time
,
after
a
minute
,
*NL*
to
continue
with
his
suggestive
but
inconclusive
smile
:
``
You
know
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
that
for
a
fellow
to
be
with
a
lady
ALWAYS
--
!
''
His
``
my
dear
''
was
*NL*
constantly
on
his
lips
for
me
,
and
nothing
could
have
expressed
more
the
*NL*
exact
shade
of
the
sentiment
with
which
I
desired
to
inspire
my
pupils
*NL*
than
its
fond
familiarity
.
It
was
so
respectfully
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
oh
,
how
I
felt
that
at
present
I
must
pick
my
own
phrases
!
I
*NL*
remember
that
,
to
gain
time
,
I
tried
to
laugh
,
and
I
seemed
to
see
in
*NL*
the
beautiful
face
with
which
he
watched
me
how
ugly
and
queer
I
looked
.
*NL*
``
And
always
with
the
same
lady
?
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
neither
blanched
nor
winked
.
The
whole
thing
was
virtually
out
*NL*
between
us
.
``
Ah
,
of
course
,
she
's
a
jolly
,
`
perfect
'
lady
;
but
,
after
*NL*
all
,
I
'm
a
fellow
,
do
n't
you
see
?
that
's
--
well
,
getting
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
lingered
there
with
him
an
instant
ever
so
kindly
.
``
Yes
,
you
're
*NL*
getting
on
.
''
Oh
,
but
I
felt
helpless
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
kept
to
this
day
the
heartbreaking
little
idea
of
how
he
seemed
*NL*
to
know
that
and
to
play
with
it
.
``
And
you
ca
n't
say
I
've
not
been
*NL*
awfully
good
,
can
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
for
,
though
I
felt
how
much
better
it
*NL*
would
have
been
to
walk
on
,
I
was
not
yet
quite
able
.
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
say
*NL*
that
,
Miles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
just
that
one
night
,
you
know
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
one
night
?
''
I
could
n't
look
as
straight
as
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
when
I
went
down
--
went
out
of
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
.
But
I
forget
what
you
did
it
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forget
?
''
--
he
spoke
with
the
sweet
extravagance
of
childish
*NL*
reproach
.
``
Why
,
it
was
to
show
you
I
could
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
you
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
can
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
that
I
might
,
perhaps
,
after
all
,
succeed
in
keeping
my
wits
*NL*
about
me
.
``
Certainly
.
But
you
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
THAT
again
.
It
was
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
nothing
,
''
I
said
.
``
But
we
must
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
resumed
our
walk
with
me
,
passing
his
hand
into
my
arm
.
``
Then
when
AM
*NL*
I
going
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
wore
,
in
turning
it
over
,
my
most
responsible
air
.
``
Were
you
very
*NL*
happy
at
school
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
just
considered
.
``
Oh
,
I
'm
happy
enough
anywhere
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
I
quavered
,
``
if
you
're
just
as
happy
here
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
that
is
n't
everything
!
Of
course
YOU
know
a
lot
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
hint
that
you
know
almost
as
much
?
''
I
risked
as
he
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
half
I
want
to
!
''
Miles
honestly
professed
.
``
But
it
is
n't
so
much
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
want
to
see
more
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
;
I
see
.
''
We
had
arrived
within
sight
of
the
church
and
of
various
*NL*
persons
,
including
several
of
the
household
of
Bly
,
on
their
way
to
it
*NL*
and
clustered
about
the
door
to
see
us
go
in
.
I
quickened
our
step
;
*NL*
I
wanted
to
get
there
before
the
question
between
us
opened
up
much
*NL*
further
;
I
reflected
hungrily
that
,
for
more
than
an
hour
,
he
would
have
*NL*
to
be
silent
;
and
I
thought
with
envy
of
the
comparative
dusk
of
the
pew
*NL*
and
of
the
almost
spiritual
help
of
the
hassock
on
which
I
might
bend
*NL*
my
knees
.
I
seemed
literally
to
be
running
a
race
with
some
confusion
*NL*
to
which
he
was
about
to
reduce
me
,
but
I
felt
that
he
had
got
in
first
*NL*
when
,
before
we
had
even
entered
the
churchyard
,
he
threw
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
my
own
sort
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
literally
made
me
bound
forward
.
``
There
are
not
many
of
your
own
*NL*
sort
,
Miles
!
''
I
laughed
.
``
Unless
perhaps
dear
little
Flora
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
really
compare
me
to
a
baby
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
found
me
singularly
weak
.
``
Do
n't
you
,
then
,
LOVE
our
sweet
Flora
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
did
n't
--
and
you
,
too
;
if
I
did
n't
--
!
''
he
repeated
as
if
retreating
*NL*
for
a
jump
,
yet
leaving
his
thought
so
unfinished
that
,
after
we
had
*NL*
come
into
the
gate
,
another
stop
,
which
he
imposed
on
me
by
the
pressure
*NL*
of
his
arm
,
had
become
inevitable
.
Mrs.
Grose
and
Flora
had
passed
into
*NL*
the
church
,
the
other
worshippers
had
followed
,
and
we
were
,
for
the
*NL*
minute
,
alone
among
the
old
,
thick
graves
.
We
had
paused
,
on
the
path
*NL*
from
the
gate
,
by
a
low
,
oblong
,
tablelike
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
you
did
n't
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
,
while
I
waited
,
at
the
graves
.
``
Well
,
you
know
what
!
''
But
*NL*
he
did
n't
move
,
and
he
presently
produced
something
that
made
me
drop
*NL*
straight
down
on
the
stone
slab
,
as
if
suddenly
to
rest
.
``
Does
my
uncle
*NL*
think
what
YOU
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
markedly
rested
.
``
How
do
you
know
what
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
of
course
I
do
n't
;
for
it
strikes
me
you
never
tell
me
.
But
I
*NL*
mean
does
HE
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
what
,
Miles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
way
I
'm
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
perceived
quickly
enough
that
I
could
make
,
to
this
inquiry
,
no
answer
*NL*
that
would
not
involve
something
of
a
sacrifice
of
my
employer
.
Yet
it
*NL*
appeared
to
me
that
we
were
all
,
at
Bly
,
sufficiently
sacrificed
to
make
*NL*
that
venial
.
``
I
do
n't
think
your
uncle
much
cares
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miles
,
on
this
,
stood
looking
at
me
.
``
Then
do
n't
you
think
he
can
be
*NL*
made
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
by
his
coming
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
'll
get
him
to
come
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
will
!
''
the
boy
said
with
extraordinary
brightness
and
emphasis
.
He
*NL*
gave
me
another
look
charged
with
that
expression
and
then
marched
off
*NL*
alone
into
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
business
was
practically
settled
from
the
moment
I
never
followed
*NL*
him
.
It
was
a
pitiful
surrender
to
agitation
,
but
my
being
aware
of
this
*NL*
had
somehow
no
power
to
restore
me
.
I
only
sat
there
on
my
tomb
and
read
*NL*
into
what
my
little
friend
had
said
to
me
the
fullness
of
its
meaning
;
*NL*
by
the
time
I
had
grasped
the
whole
of
which
I
had
also
embraced
,
for
*NL*
absence
,
the
pretext
that
I
was
ashamed
to
offer
my
pupils
and
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
congregation
such
an
example
of
delay
.
What
I
said
to
myself
*NL*
above
all
was
that
Miles
had
got
something
out
of
me
and
that
the
proof
*NL*
of
it
,
for
him
,
would
be
just
this
awkward
collapse
.
He
had
got
out
*NL*
of
me
that
there
was
something
I
was
much
afraid
of
and
that
he
should
*NL*
probably
be
able
to
make
use
of
my
fear
to
gain
,
for
his
own
purpose
,
*NL*
more
freedom
.
My
fear
was
of
having
to
deal
with
the
intolerable
*NL*
question
of
the
grounds
of
his
dismissal
from
school
,
for
that
was
*NL*
really
but
the
question
of
the
horrors
gathered
behind
.
That
his
uncle
*NL*
should
arrive
to
treat
with
me
of
these
things
was
a
solution
that
,
*NL*
strictly
speaking
,
I
ought
now
to
have
desired
to
bring
on
;
but
I
*NL*
could
so
little
face
the
ugliness
and
the
pain
of
it
that
I
simply
*NL*
procrastinated
and
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
.
The
boy
,
to
my
deep
*NL*
discomposure
,
was
immensely
in
the
right
,
was
in
a
position
to
say
*NL*
to
me
:
``
Either
you
clear
up
with
my
guardian
the
mystery
of
this
*NL*
interruption
of
my
studies
,
or
you
cease
to
expect
me
to
lead
with
you
*NL*
a
life
that
's
so
unnatural
for
a
boy
.
''
What
was
so
unnatural
for
the
*NL*
particular
boy
I
was
concerned
with
was
this
sudden
revelation
of
a
*NL*
consciousness
and
a
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
what
really
overcame
me
,
what
prevented
my
going
in
.
I
walked
*NL*
round
the
church
,
hesitating
,
hovering
;
I
reflected
that
I
had
already
,
*NL*
with
him
,
hurt
myself
beyond
repair
.
Therefore
I
could
patch
up
nothing
,
*NL*
and
it
was
too
extreme
an
effort
to
squeeze
beside
him
into
the
pew
:
he
*NL*
would
be
so
much
more
sure
than
ever
to
pass
his
arm
into
mine
and
make
*NL*
me
sit
there
for
an
hour
in
close
,
silent
contact
with
his
commentary
*NL*
on
our
talk
.
For
the
first
minute
since
his
arrival
I
wanted
to
get
away
*NL*
from
him
.
As
I
paused
beneath
the
high
east
window
and
listened
to
the
*NL*
sounds
of
worship
,
I
was
taken
with
an
impulse
that
might
master
me
,
*NL*
I
felt
,
completely
should
I
give
it
the
least
encouragement
.
I
might
*NL*
easily
put
an
end
to
my
predicament
by
getting
away
altogether
.
Here
*NL*
was
my
chance
;
there
was
no
one
to
stop
me
;
I
could
give
the
whole
thing
*NL*
up
--
turn
my
back
and
retreat
.
It
was
only
a
question
of
hurrying
again
,
*NL*
for
a
few
preparations
,
to
the
house
which
the
attendance
at
church
of
*NL*
so
many
of
the
servants
would
practically
have
left
unoccupied
.
No
one
,
*NL*
in
short
,
could
blame
me
if
I
should
just
drive
desperately
off
.
What
*NL*
was
it
to
get
away
if
I
got
away
only
till
dinner
?
That
would
be
in
*NL*
a
couple
of
hours
,
at
the
end
of
which
--
I
had
the
acute
prevision
--
my
*NL*
little
pupils
would
play
at
innocent
wonder
about
my
nonappearance
in
*NL*
their
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
DID
you
do
,
you
naughty
,
bad
thing
?
Why
in
the
world
,
to
worry
us
*NL*
so
--
and
take
our
thoughts
off
,
too
,
do
n't
you
know
?
--
did
you
desert
us
*NL*
at
the
very
door
?
''
I
could
n't
meet
such
questions
nor
,
as
they
asked
*NL*
them
,
their
false
little
lovely
eyes
;
yet
it
was
all
so
exactly
what
I
*NL*
should
have
to
meet
that
,
as
the
prospect
grew
sharp
to
me
,
I
at
last
*NL*
let
myself
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
,
so
far
as
the
immediate
moment
was
concerned
,
away
;
I
came
*NL*
straight
out
of
the
churchyard
and
,
thinking
hard
,
retraced
my
steps
*NL*
through
the
park
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
by
the
time
I
reached
the
house
*NL*
I
had
made
up
my
mind
I
would
fly
.
The
Sunday
stillness
both
of
the
*NL*
approaches
and
of
the
interior
,
in
which
I
met
no
one
,
fairly
excited
*NL*
me
with
a
sense
of
opportunity
.
Were
I
to
get
off
quickly
,
this
way
,
I
*NL*
should
get
off
without
a
scene
,
without
a
word
.
My
quickness
would
have
*NL*
to
be
remarkable
,
however
,
and
the
question
of
a
conveyance
was
the
*NL*
great
one
to
settle
.
Tormented
,
in
the
hall
,
with
difficulties
*NL*
and
obstacles
,
I
remember
sinking
down
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
staircase
--
suddenly
collapsing
there
on
the
lowest
step
and
then
,
with
a
*NL*
revulsion
,
recalling
that
it
was
exactly
where
more
than
a
month
before
,
*NL*
in
the
darkness
of
night
and
just
so
bowed
with
evil
things
,
I
had
*NL*
seen
the
specter
of
the
most
horrible
of
women
.
At
this
I
was
able
*NL*
to
straighten
myself
;
I
went
the
rest
of
the
way
up
;
I
made
,
in
my
*NL*
bewilderment
,
for
the
schoolroom
,
where
there
were
objects
belonging
to
*NL*
me
that
I
should
have
to
take
.
But
I
opened
the
door
to
find
again
,
in
a
*NL*
flash
,
my
eyes
unsealed
.
In
the
presence
of
what
I
saw
I
reeled
straight
*NL*
back
upon
my
resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seated
at
my
own
table
in
clear
noonday
light
I
saw
a
person
whom
,
*NL*
without
my
previous
experience
,
I
should
have
taken
at
the
first
blush
*NL*
for
some
housemaid
who
might
have
stayed
at
home
to
look
after
the
place
*NL*
and
who
,
availing
herself
of
rare
relief
from
observation
and
of
the
*NL*
schoolroom
table
and
my
pens
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
had
applied
herself
to
the
*NL*
considerable
effort
of
a
letter
to
her
sweetheart
.
There
was
an
effort
*NL*
in
the
way
that
,
while
her
arms
rested
on
the
table
,
her
hands
with
*NL*
evident
weariness
supported
her
head
;
but
at
the
moment
I
took
this
in
*NL*
I
had
already
become
aware
that
,
in
spite
of
my
entrance
,
her
attitude
*NL*
strangely
persisted
.
Then
it
was
--
with
the
very
act
of
its
announcing
*NL*
itself
--
that
her
identity
flared
up
in
a
change
of
posture
.
She
rose
,
*NL*
not
as
if
she
had
heard
me
,
but
with
an
indescribable
grand
melancholy
*NL*
of
indifference
and
detachment
,
and
,
within
a
dozen
feet
of
me
,
stood
*NL*
there
as
my
vile
predecessor
.
Dishonored
and
tragic
,
she
was
all
before
*NL*
me
;
but
even
as
I
fixed
and
,
for
memory
,
secured
it
,
the
awful
image
*NL*
passed
away
.
Dark
as
midnight
in
her
black
dress
,
her
haggard
beauty
and
*NL*
her
unutterable
woe
,
she
had
looked
at
me
long
enough
to
appear
to
say
*NL*
that
her
right
to
sit
at
my
table
was
as
good
as
mine
to
sit
at
hers
.
*NL*
While
these
instants
lasted
,
indeed
,
I
had
the
extraordinary
chill
of
*NL*
feeling
that
it
was
I
who
was
the
intruder
.
It
was
as
a
wild
protest
*NL*
against
it
that
,
actually
addressing
her
--
``
You
terrible
,
miserable
*NL*
woman
!
''
--
I
heard
myself
break
into
a
sound
that
,
by
the
open
door
,
rang
*NL*
through
the
long
passage
and
the
empty
house
.
She
looked
at
me
as
if
*NL*
she
heard
me
,
but
I
had
recovered
myself
and
cleared
the
air
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
in
the
room
the
next
minute
but
the
sunshine
and
a
sense
that
I
*NL*
must
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
so
perfectly
expected
that
the
return
of
my
pupils
would
be
marked
*NL*
by
a
demonstration
that
I
was
freshly
upset
at
having
to
take
into
*NL*
account
that
they
were
dumb
about
my
absence
.
Instead
of
gaily
*NL*
denouncing
and
caressing
me
,
they
made
no
allusion
to
my
having
failed
*NL*
them
,
and
I
was
left
,
for
the
time
,
on
perceiving
that
she
too
said
*NL*
nothing
,
to
study
Mrs.
Grose
's
odd
face
.
I
did
this
to
such
purpose
that
*NL*
I
made
sure
they
had
in
some
way
bribed
her
to
silence
;
a
silence
that
,
*NL*
however
,
I
would
engage
to
break
down
on
the
first
private
opportunity
.
*NL*
This
opportunity
came
before
tea
:
I
secured
five
minutes
with
her
in
the
*NL*
housekeeper
's
room
,
where
,
in
the
twilight
,
amid
a
smell
of
lately
baked
*NL*
bread
,
but
with
the
place
all
swept
and
garnished
,
I
found
her
sitting
*NL*
in
pained
placidity
before
the
fire
.
So
I
see
her
still
,
so
I
see
her
*NL*
best
:
facing
the
flame
from
her
straight
chair
in
the
dusky
,
shining
*NL*
room
,
a
large
clean
image
of
the
``
put
away
''
--
of
drawers
closed
and
*NL*
locked
and
rest
without
a
remedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
they
asked
me
to
say
nothing
;
and
to
please
them
--
so
long
as
*NL*
they
were
there
--
of
course
I
promised
.
But
what
had
happened
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
went
with
you
for
the
walk
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
had
then
to
come
back
to
*NL*
meet
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
showed
her
surprise
.
``
A
friend
--
YOU
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
have
a
couple
!
''
I
laughed
.
``
But
did
the
children
give
you
a
*NL*
reason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
not
alluding
to
your
leaving
us
?
Yes
;
they
said
you
would
like
it
*NL*
better
.
Do
you
like
it
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
face
had
made
her
rueful
.
``
No
,
I
like
it
worse
!
''
But
after
an
instant
*NL*
I

I
went
on

I
had
by

formed
the

having
Mrs.

literally
well
*NL*
in

that
even
now

she
bravely

under

I
could
keep
her

comparatively
firm

can
hear
the

the
candor

her
stupefaction

*NL*
``

this

filled

gape

myself

my

up

pressed

*NL*
*NL*
There
were
now
clearly
so
many
of
these
for
my
poor
colleague
that
she
*NL*
was
excusable
for
being
vague
.
``
But

a

said
Mrs.

with
decision

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
put
it

I
went
on
inexorably

``
that

He
's
exquisite

so
it
can
be

THAT

that

open
up

I
said

She
had

turned
quite
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
sha

I
answered

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

she
emphatically
returned

*NL*
I
was
silent
awhile

we
looked
at
each
other
.

Then
what
am
I

tell

him

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
I
measured
this

``
Do

Remembering
she
could

*NL*
I
caught
myself
up
.
``
How
do
you
communicate

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
My
question
had
a
sarcastic
force
that
I
had
not
fully
intended
,
and
*NL*
it
made
her
,
after
a
moment
,
inconsequently
break
down
.
The
tears
were
*NL*
again
in
her
eyes
.
``
Ah
,
miss
,
YOU
write
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
tonight
,
''
I
at
last
answered
;
and
on
this
we
separated
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
so
far
,
in
the
evening
,
as
to
make
a
beginning
.
The
weather
had
*NL*
changed
back
,
a
great
wind
was
abroad
,
and
beneath
the
lamp
,
in
my
room
,
*NL*
with
Flora
at
peace
beside
me
,
I
sat
for
a
long
time
before
a
blank
*NL*
sheet
of
paper
and
listened
to
the
lash
of
the
rain
and
the
batter
of
*NL*
the
gusts
.
Finally
I
went
out
,
taking
a
candle
;
I
crossed
the
passage
*NL*
and
listened
a
minute
at
Miles
's
door
.
What
,
under
my
endless
obsession
,
*NL*
I
had
been
impelled
to
listen
for
was
some
betrayal
of
his
not
being
at
*NL*
rest
,
and
I
presently
caught
one
,
but
not
in
the
form
I
had
expected
.
*NL*
His
voice
tinkled
out
.
``
I
say
,
you
there
--
come
in
.
''
It
was
a
gaiety
in
*NL*
the
gloom
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
in
with
my
light
and
found
him
,
in
bed
,
very
wide
awake
,
but
very
*NL*
much
at
his
ease
.
``
Well
,
what
are
YOU
up
to
?
''
he
asked
with
a
grace
of
*NL*
sociability
in
which
it
occurred
to
me
that
Mrs.
Grose
,
had
she
been
*NL*
present
,
might
have
looked
in
vain
for
proof
that
anything
was
``
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
over
him
with
my
candle
.
``
How
did
you
know
I
was
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
I
heard
you
.
Did
you
fancy
you
made
no
noise
?
You
're
*NL*
like
a
troop
of
cavalry
!
''
he
beautifully
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
were
n't
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
!
I
lie
awake
and
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
put
my
candle
,
designedly
,
a
short
way
off
,
and
then
,
as
he
held
*NL*
out
his
friendly
old
hand
to
me
,
had
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
.
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
''
I
asked
,
``
that
you
think
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
in
the
world
,
my
dear
,
but
YOU
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
pride
I
take
in
your
appreciation
does
n't
insist
on
that
!
I
had
*NL*
so
far
rather
you
slept
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
think
also
,
you
know
,
of
this
queer
business
of
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
marked
the
coolness
of
his
firm
little
hand
.
``
Of
what
queer
business
,
*NL*
Miles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
way
you
bring
me
up
.
And
all
the
rest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
fairly
held
my
breath
a
minute
,
and
even
from
my
glimmering
taper
*NL*
there
was
light
enough
to
show
how
he
smiled
up
at
me
from
his
pillow
.
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
all
the
rest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
know
,
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
say
nothing
for
a
minute
,
though
I
felt
,
as
I
held
his
hand
and
*NL*
our
eyes
continued
to
meet
,
that
my
silence
had
all
the
air
of
admitting
*NL*
his
charge
and
that
nothing
in
the
whole
world
of
reality
was
perhaps
at
*NL*
that
moment
so
fabulous
as
our
actual
relation
.
``
Certainly
you
shall
go
*NL*
back
to
school
,
''
I
said
,
``
if
it
be
that
that
troubles
you
.
But
not
to
*NL*
the
old
place
--
we
must
find
another
,
a
better
.
How
could
I
know
it
did
*NL*
trouble
you
,
this
question
,
when
you
never
told
me
so
,
never
spoke
of
it
*NL*
at
all
?
''
His
clear
,
listening
face
,
framed
in
its
smooth
whiteness
,
made
*NL*
him
for
the
minute
as
appealing
as
some
wistful
patient
in
a
children
's
*NL*
hospital
;
and
I
would
have
given
,
as
the
resemblance
came
to
me
,
all
I
*NL*
possessed
on
earth
really
to
be
the
nurse
or
the
sister
of
charity
who
*NL*
might
have
helped
to
cure
him
.
Well
,
even
as
it
was
,
I
perhaps
might
*NL*
help
!
``
Do
you
know
you
've
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
your
school
--
I
*NL*
mean
the
old
one
;
never
mentioned
it
in
any
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
wonder
;
he
smiled
with
the
same
loveliness
.
But
he
clearly
*NL*
gained
time
;
he
waited
,
he
called
for
guidance
.
``
Have
n't
I
?
''
It
was
n't
*NL*
for
ME
to
help
him
--
it
was
for
the
thing
I
had
met
!
*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
his
tone
and
the
expression
of
his
face
,
as
I
got
this
from
*NL*
him
,
set
my
heart
aching
with
such
a
pang
as
it
had
never
yet
known
;
*NL*
so
unutterably
touching
was
it
to
see
his
little
brain
puzzled
and
his
*NL*
little
resources
taxed
to
play
,
under
the
spell
laid
on
him
,
a
part
*NL*
of
innocence
and
consistency
.
``
No
,
never
--
from
the
hour
you
came
back
.
*NL*
You
've
never
mentioned
to
me
one
of
your
masters
,
one
of
your
comrades
,
*NL*
nor
the
least
little
thing
that
ever
happened
to
you
at
school
.
Never
,
*NL*
little
Miles
--
no
,
never
--
have
you
given
me
an
inkling
of
anything
that
*NL*
MAY
have
happened
there
.
Therefore
you
can
fancy
how
much
I
'm
in
the
*NL*
dark
.
Until
you
came
out
,
that
way
,
this
morning
,
you
had
,
since
the
*NL*
first
hour
I
saw
you
,
scarce
even
made
a
reference
to
anything
in
your
*NL*
previous
life
.
You
seemed
so
perfectly
to
accept
the
present
.
''
It
was
*NL*
extraordinary
how
my
absolute
conviction
of
his
secret
precocity
-LRB-
or
*NL*
whatever
I
might
call
the
poison
of
an
influence
that
I
dared
but
half
*NL*
to
phrase
-RRB-
made
him
,
in
spite
of
the
faint
breath
of
his
inward
trouble
,
*NL*
appear
as
accessible
as
an
older
person
--
imposed
him
almost
as
an
*NL*
intellectual
equal
.
``
I
thought
you
wanted
to
go
on
as
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
struck
me
that
at
this
he
just
faintly
colored
.
He
gave
,
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
like
a
convalescent
slightly
fatigued
,
a
languid
shake
of
his
head
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
--
I
do
n't
.
I
want
to
get
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
tired
of
Bly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
like
Bly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
YOU
know
what
a
boy
wants
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
that
I
did
n't
know
so
well
as
Miles
,
and
I
took
temporary
refuge
.
*NL*
``
You
want
to
go
to
your
uncle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
at
this
,
with
his
sweet
ironic
face
,
he
made
a
movement
on
the
*NL*
pillow
.
``
Ah
,
you
ca
n't
get
off
with
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
silent
a
little
,
and
it
was
I
,
now
,
I
think
,
who
changed
color
.
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
I
do
n't
want
to
get
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
,
even
if
you
do
.
You
ca
n't
,
you
ca

''
--
he
lay
beautifully
*NL*
staring
.
``
My
uncle
must
come
down
,
and
you
must
completely
settle
*NL*
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
do
,
''
I
returned
with
some
spirit
,
``
you
may
be
sure
it
will
be
to
*NL*
take
you
quite
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
n't
you
understand
that
that
's
exactly
what
I
'm
working
for

*NL*
You
'll
have
to
tell
him
--
about
the
way
you
've
let
it
all
drop
:
you
'll
*NL*
have
to
tell
him
a
tremendous
lot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
exultation
with
which
he
uttered
this
helped
me
somehow
,
for
the
*NL*
instant
,
to
meet
him
rather
more
.
``
And
how
much
will
YOU
,
Miles
,
have
to
*NL*
tell
him
?
There
are
things
he
'll
ask
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
it
over
.
``
Very
likely
.
But
what
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
things
you
've
never
told
me
.
To
make
up
his
mind
what
to
do
with
*NL*
you
.
He
ca
n't
send
you
back
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
want
to
go
back
!
''
he
broke
in
.
``
I
want
a
new
field
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
with
admirable
serenity
,
with
positive
unimpeachable
*NL*
gaiety
;
and
doubtless
it
was
that
very
note
that
most
evoked
for
me
the
*NL*
poignancy
,
the
unnatural
childish
tragedy
,
of
his
probable
reappearance
*NL*
at
the
end
of
three
months
with
all
this
bravado
and
still
more
*NL*
dishonor
.
It
overwhelmed
me
now
that
I
should
never
be
able
to
bear
*NL*
that
,
and
it
made
me
let
myself
go
.
I
threw
myself
upon
him
and
in
the
*NL*
tenderness
of
my
pity
I
embraced
him
.
``
Dear
little
Miles
,
dear
little
*NL*
Miles
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
face
was
close
to
his
,
and
he
let
me
kiss
him
,
simply
taking
it
with
*NL*
indulgent
good
humor
.
``
Well
,
old
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
nothing
--
nothing
at
all
that
you
want
to
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
off
a
little
,
facing
round
toward
the
wall
and
holding
up
his
*NL*
hand
to
look
at
as
one
had
seen
sick
children
look
.
``
I
've
told
you
--
I
*NL*
told
you
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
I
was
sorry
for
him
!
``
That
you
just
want
me
not
to
worry
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
round
at
me
now
,
as
if
in
recognition
of
my
understanding
him
;
*NL*
then
ever
so
gently
,
``
To
let
me
alone
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
even
a
singular
little
dignity
in
it
,
something
that
made
me
*NL*
release
him
,
yet
,
when
I
had
slowly
risen
,
linger
beside
him
.
God
knows
*NL*
I
never
wished
to
harass
him
,
but
I
felt
that
merely
,
at
this
,
to
turn
*NL*
my
back
on
him
was
to
abandon
or
,
to
put
it
more
truly
,
to
lose
him
.
*NL*
``
I
've
just
begun
a
letter
to
your
uncle
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
finish
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
waited
a
minute
.
``
What
happened
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gazed
up
at
me
again
.
``
Before
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
you
came
back
.
And
before
you
went
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
he
was
silent
,
but
he
continued
to
meet
my
eyes
.
``
What
*NL*
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
me
,
the
sound
of
the
words
,
in
which
it
seemed
to
me
that
*NL*
I
caught
for
the
very
first
time
a
small
faint
quaver
of
consenting
*NL*
consciousness
--
it
made
me
drop
on
my
knees
beside
the
bed
and
seize
*NL*
once
more
the
chance
of
possessing
him
.
``
Dear
little
Miles
,
dear
little
*NL*
Miles
,
if
you
KNEW
how
I
want
to
help
you
!
It
's
only
that
,
it
's
nothing
*NL*
but
that
,
and
I
'd
rather
die
than
give
you
a
pain
or
do
you
a
wrong
--
I
'd
*NL*
rather
die
than
hurt
a
hair
of
you
.
Dear
little
Miles
''
--
oh
,
I
brought
it
*NL*
out
now
even
if
I
SHOULD
go
too
far
--
``
I
just
want
you
to
help
me
to
save
*NL*
you
!
''
But
I
knew
in
a
moment
after
this
that
I
had
gone
too
far
.
The
*NL*
answer
to
my
appeal
was
instantaneous
,
but
it
came
in
the
form
of
an
*NL*
extraordinary
blast
and
chill
,
a
gust
of
frozen
air
,
and
a
shake
of
the
*NL*
room
as
great
as
if
,
in
the
wild
wind
,
the
casement
had
crashed
in
.
The
*NL*
boy
gave
a
loud
,
high
shriek
,
which
,
lost
in
the
rest
of
the
shock
of
*NL*
sound
,
might
have
seemed
,
indistinctly
,
though
I
was
so
close
to
him
,
*NL*
a
note
either
of
jubilation
or
of
terror
.
I
jumped
to
my
feet
again
and
*NL*
was
conscious
of
darkness
.
So
for
a
moment
we
remained
,
while
I
stared
*NL*
about
me
and
saw
that
the
drawn
curtains
were
unstirred
and
the
window
*NL*
tight
.
``
Why
,
the
candle
's
out
!
''
I
then
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
I
who
blew
it
,
dear
!
''
said
Miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
after
lessons
,
Mrs.
Grose
found
a
moment
to
say
to
me
*NL*
quietly
:
``
Have
you
written
,
miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
've
written
.
''
But
I
did
n't
add
--
for
the
hour
--
that
my
letter
,
*NL*
sealed
and
directed
,
was
still
in
my
pocket
.
There
would
be
time
enough
*NL*
to
send
it
before
the
messenger
should
go
to
the
village
.
Meanwhile
*NL*
there
had
been
,
on
the
part
of
my
pupils
,
no
more
brilliant
,
more
*NL*
exemplary
morning
.
It
was
exactly
as
if
they
had
both
had
at
heart
to
*NL*
gloss
over
any
recent
little
friction
.
They
performed
the
dizziest
feats
*NL*
of
arithmetic
,
soaring
quite
out
of
MY
feeble
range
,
and
perpetrated
,
*NL*
in
higher
spirits
than
ever
,
geographical
and
historical
jokes
.
It
was
*NL*
conspicuous
of
course
in
Miles
in
particular
that
he
appeared
to
wish
to
*NL*
show
how
easily
he
could
let
me
down
.
This
child
,
to
my
memory
,
really
*NL*
lives
in
a
setting
of
beauty
and
misery
that
no
words
can
translate
;
*NL*
there
was
a
distinction
all
his
own
in
every
impulse
he
revealed
;
never
*NL*
was
a
small
natural
creature
,
to
the
uninitiated
eye
all
frankness
and
*NL*
freedom
,
a
more
ingenious
,
a
more
extraordinary
little
gentleman
.
I
had
*NL*
perpetually
to
guard
against
the
wonder
of
contemplation
into
which
my
*NL*
initiated
view
betrayed
me
;
to
check
the
irrelevant
gaze
and
discouraged
*NL*
sigh
in
which
I
constantly
both
attacked
and
renounced
the
enigma
of
*NL*
what
such
a
little
gentleman
could
have
done
that
deserved
a
penalty
.
*NL*
Say
that
,
by
the
dark
prodigy
I
knew
,
the
imagination
of
all
evil
HAD
*NL*
been
opened
up
to
him
:
all
the
justice
within
me
ached
for
the
proof
*NL*
that
it
could
ever
have
flowered
into
an
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
never
,
at
any
rate
,
been
such
a
little
gentleman
as
when
,
after
*NL*
our
early
dinner
on
this
dreadful
day
,
he
came
round
to
me
and
asked
if
*NL*
I
should
n't
like
him
,
for
half
an
hour
,
to
play
to
me
.
David
playing
*NL*
to
Saul
could
never
have
shown
a
finer
sense
of
the
occasion
.
It
was
*NL*
literally
a
charming
exhibition
of
tact
,
of
magnanimity
,
and
quite
*NL*
tantamount
to
his
saying
outright
:
``
The
true
knights
we
love
to
read
*NL*
about
never
push
an
advantage
too
far
.
I
know
what
you
mean
now
:
you
*NL*
mean
that
--
to
be
let
alone
yourself
and
not
followed
up
--
you
'll
cease
to
*NL*
worry
and
spy
upon
me
,
wo
n't
keep
me
so
close
to
you
,
will
let
me
go
*NL*
and
come
.
Well
,
I
`
come
,
'
you
see
--
but
I
do
n't
go
!
There
'll
be
plenty
of
*NL*
time
for
that
.
I
do
really
delight
in
your
society
,
and
I
only
want
to
*NL*
show
you
that
I
contended
for
a
principle
.
''
It
may
be
imagined
whether
I
*NL*
resisted
this
appeal
or
failed
to
accompany
him
again
,
hand
in
hand
,
to
*NL*
the
schoolroom
.
He
sat
down
at
the
old
piano
and
played
as
he
had
never
*NL*
played
;
and
if
there
are
those
who
think
he
had
better
have
been
kicking
*NL*
a
football
I
can
only
say
that
I
wholly
agree
with
them
.
For
at
the
*NL*
end
of
a
time
that
under
his
influence
I
had
quite
ceased
to
measure
,
I
*NL*
started
up
with
a
strange
sense
of
having
literally
slept
at
my
post
.
It
*NL*
was
after
luncheon
,
and
by
the
schoolroom
fire
,
and
yet
I
had
n't
*NL*
really
,
in
the
least
,
slept
:
I
had
only
done
something
much
worse
--
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
.
Where
,
all
this
time
,
was
Flora
?
When
I
put
the
question
to
*NL*
Miles
,
he
played
on
a
minute
before
answering
and
then
could
only
say
:
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
dear
,
how
do
_
I
_
know
?
''
--
breaking
moreover
into
a
happy
laugh
*NL*
which
,
immediately
after
,
as
if
it
were
a
vocal
accompaniment
,
he
*NL*
prolonged
into
incoherent
,
extravagant
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
straight
to
my
room
,
but
his
sister
was
not
there
;
then
,
before
*NL*
going
downstairs
,
I
looked
into
several
others
.
As
she
was
nowhere
*NL*
about
she
would
surely
be
with
Mrs.
Grose
,
whom
,
in
the
comfort
of
that
*NL*
theory
,
I
accordingly
proceeded
in
quest
of
.
I
found
her
where
I
had
*NL*
found
her
the
evening
before
,
but
she
met
my
quick
challenge
with
blank
,
*NL*
scared
ignorance
.
She
had
only
supposed
that
,
after
the
repast
,
I
had
*NL*
carried
off
both
the
children
;
as
to
which
she
was
quite
in
her
right
,
*NL*
for
it
was
the
very
first
time
I
had
allowed
the
little
girl
out
of
my
*NL*
sight
without
some
special
provision
.
Of
course
now
indeed
she
might
be
*NL*
with
the
maids
,
so
that
the
immediate
thing
was
to
look
for
her
without
*NL*
an
air
of
alarm
.
This
we
promptly
arranged
between
us
;
but
when
,
ten
*NL*
minutes
later
and
in
pursuance
of
our
arrangement
,
we
met
in
the
hall
,
*NL*
it
was
only
to
report
on
either
side
that
after
guarded
inquiries
we
*NL*
had
altogether
failed
to
trace
her
.
For
a
minute
there
,
apart
from
*NL*
observation
,
we
exchanged
mute
alarms
,
and
I
could
feel
with
what
high
*NL*
interest
my
friend
returned
me
all
those
I
had
from
the
first
given
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
be
above
,
''
she
presently
said
--
``
in
one
of
the
rooms
you
have
n't
*NL*
searched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
she
's
at
a
distance
.
''
I
had
made
up
my
mind
.
``
She
has
gone
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
stared
.
``
Without
a
hat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
naturally
also
looked
volumes
.
``
Is
n't
that
woman
always
without
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
with
HER
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
with
HER
!
''
I
declared
.
``
We
must
find
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
hand
was
on
my
friend
's
arm
,
but
she
failed
for
the
moment
,
*NL*
confronted
with
such
an
account
of
the
matter
,
to
respond
to
my
*NL*
pressure
.
She
communed
,
on
the
contrary
,
on
the
spot
,
with
her
*NL*
uneasiness
.
``
And
where
's
Master
Miles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
HE
'S
with
Quint
.
They
're
in
the
schoolroom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
miss
!
''
My
view
,
I
was
myself
aware
--
and
therefore
I
suppose
my
*NL*
tone
--
had
never
yet
reached
so
calm
an
assurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
trick
's
played
,
''
I
went
on
;
``
they
've
successfully
worked
their
*NL*
plan
.
He
found
the
most
divine
little
way
to
keep
me
quiet
while
she
*NL*
went
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Divine
'
?
''
Mrs.
Grose
bewilderedly
echoed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Infernal
,
then
!
''
I
almost
cheerfully
rejoined
.
``
He
has
provided
for
*NL*
himself
as
well
.
But
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
helplessly
gloomed
at
the
upper
regions
.
``
You
leave
him
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
with
Quint
?
Yes
--
I
do
n't
mind
that
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
always
ended
,
at
these
moments
,
by
getting
possession
of
my
hand
,
*NL*
and
in
this
manner
she
could
at
present
still
stay
me
.
But
after
gasping
*NL*
an
instant
at
my
sudden
resignation
,
``
Because
of
your
letter
?
''
she
*NL*
eagerly
brought
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
quickly
,
by
way
of
answer
,
felt
for
my
letter
,
drew
it
forth
,
held
it
*NL*
up
,
and
then
,
freeing
myself
,
went
and
laid
it
on
the
great
hall
table
.
*NL*
``
Luke
will
take
it
,
''
I
said
as
I
came
back
.
I
reached
the
house
door
and
*NL*
opened
it
;
I
was
already
on
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
companion
still
demurred
:
the
storm
of
the
night
and
the
early
*NL*
morning
had
dropped
,
but
the
afternoon
was
damp
and
gray
.
I
came
down
to
*NL*
the
drive
while
she
stood
in
the
doorway
.
``
You
go
with
nothing
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
care
when
the
child
has
nothing
?
I
ca
n't
wait
to
dress
,
''
I
*NL*
cried
,
``
and
if
you
must
do
so
,
I
leave
you
.
Try
meanwhile
,
yourself
,
*NL*
upstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
THEM
?
''
Oh
,
on
this
,
the
poor
woman
promptly
joined
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
straight
to
the
lake
,
as
it
was
called
at
Bly
,
and
I
daresay
*NL*
rightly
called
,
though
I
reflect
that
it
may
in
fact
have
been
a
sheet
*NL*
of
water
less
remarkable
than
it
appeared
to
my
untraveled
eyes
.
My
*NL*
acquaintance
with
sheets
of
water
was
small
,
and
the
pool
of
Bly
,
at
all
*NL*
events
on
the
few
occasions
of
my
consenting
,
under
the
protection
of
*NL*
my
pupils
,
to
affront
its
surface
in
the
old
flat-bottomed
boat
moored
*NL*
there
for
our
use
,
had
impressed
me
both
with
its
extent
and
its
*NL*
agitation
.
The
usual
place
of
embarkation
was
half
a
mile
from
the
*NL*
house
,
but
I
had
an
intimate
conviction
that
,
wherever
Flora
might
*NL*
be
,
she
was
not
near
home
.
She
had
not
given
me
the
slip
for
any
small
*NL*
adventure
,
and
,
since
the
day
of
the
very
great
one
that
I
had
shared
*NL*
with
her
by
the
pond
,
I
had
been
aware
,
in
our
walks
,
of
the
quarter
to
*NL*
which
she
most
inclined
.
This
was
why
I
had
now
given
to
Mrs.
Grose
's
*NL*
steps
so
marked
a
direction
--
a
direction
that
made
her
,
when
she
*NL*
perceived
it
,
oppose
a
resistance
that
showed
me
she
was
freshly
*NL*
mystified
.
``
You
're
going
to
the
water
,
Miss
?
--
you
think
she
's
IN
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
may
be
,
though
the
depth
is
,
I
believe
,
nowhere
very
great
.
But
*NL*
what
I
judge
most
likely
is
that
she
's
on
the
spot
from
which
,
the
other
*NL*
day
,
we
saw
together
what
I
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
she
pretended
not
to
see
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
that
astounding
self-possession
?
I
've
always
been
sure
she
wanted
*NL*
to
go
back
alone
.
And
now
her
brother
has
managed
it
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
still
stood
where
she
had
stopped
.
``
You
suppose
they
really
*NL*
TALK
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
meet
this
with
a
confidence
!
They
say
things
that
,
if
we
heard
*NL*
them
,
would
simply
appall
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
she
IS
there
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
Miss
Jessel
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beyond
a
doubt
.
You
shall
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
!
''
my
friend
cried
,
planted
so
firm
that
,
taking
it
in
,
I
*NL*
went
straight
on
without
her
.
By
the
time
I
reached
the
pool
,
however
,
*NL*
she
was
close
behind
me
,
and
I
knew
that
,
whatever
,
to
her
apprehension
,
*NL*
might
befall
me
,
the
exposure
of
my
society
struck
her
as
her
least
*NL*
danger
.
She
exhaled
a
moan
of
relief
as
we
at
last
came
in
sight
of
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
the
water
without
a
sight
of
the
child
.
There
was
no
*NL*
trace
of
Flora
on
that
nearer
side
of
the
bank
where
my
observation
of
*NL*
her
had
been
most
startling
,
and
none
on
the
opposite
edge
,
where
,
save
*NL*
for
a
margin
of
some
twenty
yards
,
a
thick
copse
came
down
to
the
water
.
*NL*
The
pond
,
oblong
in
shape
,
had
a
width
so
scant
compared
to
its
length
*NL*
that
,
with
its
ends
out
of
view
,
it
might
have
been
taken
for
a
scant
*NL*
river
.
We
looked
at
the
empty
expanse
,
and
then
I
felt
the
suggestion
*NL*
of
my
friend
's
eyes
.
I
knew
what
she
meant
and
I
replied
with
a
negative
*NL*
headshake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
wait
!
She
has
taken
the
boat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
companion
stared
at
the
vacant
mooring
place
and
then
again
across
*NL*
the
lake
.
``
Then
where
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
not
seeing
it
is
the
strongest
of
proofs
.
She
has
used
it
to
go
*NL*
over
,
and
then
has
managed
to
hide
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
alone
--
that
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
alone
,
and
at
such
times
she
's
not
a
child
:
she
's
an
old
,
*NL*
old
woman
.
''
I
scanned
all
the
visible
shore
while
Mrs.
Grose
took
again
,
*NL*
into
the
queer
element
I
offered
her
,
one
of
her
plunges
of
submission
;
*NL*
then
I
pointed
out
that
the
boat
might
perfectly
be
in
a
small
refuge
*NL*
formed
by
one
of
the
recesses
of
the
pool
,
an
indentation
masked
,
for
*NL*
the
hither
side
,
by
a
projection
of
the
bank
and
by
a
clump
of
trees
*NL*
growing
close
to
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
the
boat
's
there
,
where
on
earth
's
SHE
?
''
my
colleague
anxiously
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
what
we
must
learn
.
''
And
I
started
to
walk
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
going
all
the
way
round
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
far
as
it
is
.
It
will
take
us
but
ten
minutes
,
but
it
's
*NL*
far
enough
to
have
made
the
child
prefer
not
to
walk
.
She
went
straight
*NL*
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laws
!
''
cried
my
friend
again
;
the
chain
of
my
logic
was
ever
too
*NL*
much
for
her
.
It
dragged
her
at
my
heels
even
now
,
and
when
we
had
got
*NL*
halfway
round
--
a
devious
,
tiresome
process
,
on
ground
much
broken
and
by
*NL*
a
path
choked
with
overgrowth
--
I
paused
to
give
her
breath
.
I
sustained
*NL*
her
with
a
grateful
arm
,
assuring
her
that
she
might
hugely
help
me
;
and
*NL*
this
started
us
afresh
,
so
that
in
the
course
of
but
few
minutes
more
we
*NL*
reached
a
point
from
which
we
found
the
boat
to
be
where
I
had
supposed
*NL*
it
.
It
had
been
intentionally
left
as
much
as
possible
out
of
sight
and
*NL*
was
tied
to
one
of
the
stakes
of
a
fence
that
came
,
just
there
,
down
to
*NL*
the
brink
and
that
had
been
an
assistance
to
disembarking
.
I
recognized
,
*NL*
as
I
looked
at
the
pair
of
short
,
thick
oars
,
quite
safely
drawn
up
,
the
*NL*
prodigious
character
of
the
feat
for
a
little
girl
;
but
I
had
lived
,
by
*NL*
this
time
,
too
long
among
wonders
and
had
panted
to
too
many
livelier
*NL*
measures
.
There
was
a
gate
in
the
fence
,
through
which
we
passed
,
and
*NL*
that
brought
us
,
after
a
trifling
interval
,
more
into
the
open
.
Then
,
*NL*
``
There
she
is
!
''
we
both
exclaimed
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Flora
,
a
short
way
off
,
stood
before
us
on
the
grass
and
smiled
as
if
*NL*
her
performance
was
now
complete
.
The
next
thing
she
did
,
however
,
was
*NL*
to
stoop
straight
down
and
pluck
--
quite
as
if
it
were
all
she
was
there
*NL*
for
--
a
big
,
ugly
spray
of
withered
fern
.
I
instantly
became
sure
she
*NL*
had
just
come
out
of
the
copse
.
She
waited
for
us
,
not
herself
taking
a
*NL*
step
,
and
I
was
conscious
of
the
rare
solemnity
with
which
we
presently
*NL*
approached
her
.
She
smiled
and
smiled
,
and
we
met
;
but
it
was
all
done
*NL*
in
a
silence
by
this
time
flagrantly
ominous
.
Mrs.
Grose
was
the
first
*NL*
to
break
the
spell
:
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
,
drawing
the
*NL*
child
to
her
breast
,
clasped
in
a
long
embrace
the
little
tender
,
*NL*
yielding
body
.
While
this
dumb
convulsion
lasted
I
could
only
watch
*NL*
it
--
which
I
did
the
more
intently
when
I
saw
Flora
's
face
peep
at
me
*NL*
over
our
companion
's
shoulder
.
It
was
serious
now
--
the
flicker
had
left
*NL*
it
;
but
it
strengthened
the
pang
with
which
I
at
that
moment
envied
Mrs.
*NL*
Grose
the
simplicity
of
HER
relation
.
Still
,
all
this
while
,
nothing
*NL*
more
passed
between
us
save
that
Flora
had
let
her
foolish
fern
again
*NL*
drop
to
the
ground
.
What
she
and
I
had
virtually
said
to
each
other
was
*NL*
that
pretexts
were
useless
now
.
When
Mrs.
Grose
finally
got
up
she
kept
*NL*
the
child
's
hand
,
so
that
the
two
were
still
before
me
;
and
the
singular
*NL*
reticence
of
our
communion
was
even
more
marked
in
the
frank
look
she
*NL*
launched
me
.
``
I
'll
be
hanged
,
''
it
said
,
``
if
_
I
_
'll
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Flora
who
,
gazing
all
over
me
in
candid
wonder
,
was
the
first
.
*NL*
She
was
struck
with
our
bareheaded
aspect
.
``
Why
,
where
are
your
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
yours
are
,
my
dear
!
''
I
promptly
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
already
got
back
her
gaiety
,
and
appeared
to
take
this
as
an
*NL*
answer
quite
sufficient
.
``
And
where
's
Miles
?
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
in
the
small
valor
of
it
that
quite
finished
me
:
*NL*
these
three
words
from
her
were
,
in
a
flash
like
the
glitter
of
a
drawn
*NL*
blade
,
the
jostle
of
the
cup
that
my
hand
,
for
weeks
and
weeks
,
had
*NL*
held
high
and
full
to
the
brim
that
now
,
even
before
speaking
,
I
felt
*NL*
overflow
in
a
deluge
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
if
you
'll
tell
ME
--
''
I
heard
myself
*NL*
say
,
then
heard
the
tremor
in
which
it
broke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
's
suspense
blazed
at
me
,
but
it
was
too
late
now
,
and
I
*NL*
brought
the
thing
out
handsomely
.
``
Where
,
my
pet
,
is
Miss
Jessel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
in
the
churchyard
with
Miles
,
the
whole
thing
was
upon
us
.
Much
*NL*
as
I
had
made
of
the
fact
that
this
name
had
never
once
,
between
us
,
*NL*
been
sounded
,
the
quick
,
smitten
glare
with
which
the
child
's
face
now
*NL*
received
it
fairly
likened
my
breach
of
the
silence
to
the
smash
of
a
*NL*
pane
of
glass
.
It
added
to
the
interposing
cry
,
as
if
to
stay
the
blow
,
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Grose
,
at
the
same
instant
,
uttered
over
my
violence
--
the
*NL*
shriek
of
a
creature
scared
,
or
rather
wounded
,
which
,
in
turn
,
within
a
*NL*
few
seconds
,
was
completed
by
a
gasp
of
my
own
.
I
seized
my
colleague
's
*NL*
arm
.
``
She
's
there
,
she
's
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Jessel
stood
before
us
on
the
opposite
bank
exactly
as
she
had
*NL*
stood
the
other
time
,
and
I
remember
,
strangely
,
as
the
first
feeling
*NL*
now
produced
in
me
,
my
thrill
of
joy
at
having
brought
on
a
proof
.
She
*NL*
was
there
,
and
I
was
justified
;
she
was
there
,
and
I
was
neither
cruel
*NL*
nor
mad
.
She
was
there
for
poor
scared
Mrs.
Grose
,
but
she
was
there
*NL*
most
for
Flora
;
and
no
moment
of
my
monstrous
time
was
perhaps
so
*NL*
extraordinary
as
that
in
which
I
consciously
threw
out
to
her
--
with
*NL*
the
sense
that
,
pale
and
ravenous
demon
as
she
was
,
she
would
catch
and
*NL*
understand
it
--
an
inarticulate
message
of
gratitude
.
She
rose
erect
on
*NL*
the
spot
my
friend
and
I
had
lately
quitted
,
and
there
was
not
,
in
all
*NL*
the
long
reach
of
her
desire
,
an
inch
of
her
evil
that
fell
short
.
This
*NL*
first
vividness
of
vision
and
emotion
were
things
of
a
few
seconds
,
*NL*
during
which
Mrs.
Grose
's
dazed
blink
across
to
where
I
pointed
struck
*NL*
me
as
a
sovereign
sign
that
she
too
at
last
saw
,
just
as
it
carried
my
*NL*
own
eyes
precipitately
to
the
child
.
The
revelation
then
of
the
manner
*NL*
in
which
Flora
was
affected
startled
me
,
in
truth
,
far
more
than
it
*NL*
would
have
done
to
find
her
also
merely
agitated
,
for
direct
dismay
*NL*
was
of
course
not
what
I
had
expected
.
Prepared
and
on
her
guard
as
our
*NL*
pursuit
had
actually
made
her
,
she
would
repress
every
betrayal
;
and
I
*NL*
was
therefore
shaken
,
on
the
spot
,
by
my
first
glimpse
of
the
particular
*NL*
one
for
which
I
had
not
allowed
.
To
see
her
,
without
a
convulsion
of
*NL*
her
small
pink
face
,
not
even
feign
to
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
*NL*
prodigy
I
announced
,
but
only
,
instead
of
that
,
turn
at
ME
an
expression
*NL*
of
hard
,
still
gravity
,
an
expression
absolutely
new
and
unprecedented
*NL*
and
that
appeared
to
read
and
accuse
and
judge
me
--
this
was
a
stroke
*NL*
that
somehow
converted
the
little
girl
herself
into
the
very
presence
*NL*
that
could
make
me
quail
.
I
quailed
even
though
my
certitude
that
*NL*
she
thoroughly
saw
was
never
greater
than
at
that
instant
,
and
in
the
*NL*
immediate
need
to
defend
myself
I
called
it
passionately
to
witness
.
*NL*
``
She
's
there
,
you
little
unhappy
thing
--
there
,
there
,
THERE
,
and
you
see
*NL*
her
as
well
as
you
see
me
!
''
I
had
said
shortly
before
to
Mrs.
Grose
*NL*
that
she
was
not
at
these
times
a
child
,
but
an
old
,
old
woman
,
and
that
*NL*
description
of
her
could
not
have
been
more
strikingly
confirmed
than
in
*NL*
the
way
in
which
,
for
all
answer
to
this
,
she
simply
showed
me
,
without
*NL*
a
concession
,
an
admission
,
of
her
eyes
,
a
countenance
of
deeper
and
*NL*
deeper
,
of
indeed
suddenly
quite
fixed
,
reprobation
.
I
was
by
this
*NL*
time
--
if
I
can
put
the
whole
thing
at
all
together
--
more
appalled
at
*NL*
what
I
may
properly
call
her
manner
than
at
anything
else
,
though
it
was
*NL*
simultaneously
with
this
that
I
became
aware
of
having
Mrs.
Grose
*NL*
also
,
and
very
formidably
,
to
reckon
with
.
My
elder
companion
,
the
next
*NL*
moment
,
at
any
rate
,
blotted
out
everything
but
her
own
flushed
face
and
*NL*
her
loud
,
shocked
protest
,
a
burst
of
high
disapproval
.
``
What
a
dreadful
*NL*
turn
,
to
be
sure
,
miss
!
Where
on
earth
do
you
see
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
only
grasp
her
more
quickly
yet
,
for
even
while
she
spoke
the
*NL*
hideous
plain
presence
stood
undimmed
and
undaunted
.
It
had
already
*NL*
lasted
a
minute
,
and
it
lasted
while
I
continued
,
seizing
my
colleague
,
*NL*
quite
thrusting
her
at
it
and
presenting
her
to
it
,
to
insist
with
my
*NL*
pointing
hand
.
``
You
do
n't
see
her
exactly
as
WE
see
?
--
you
mean
to
say
*NL*
you
do
n't
now
--
NOW
?
She
's
as
big
as
a
blazing
fire
!
Only
look
,
dearest
*NL*
woman
,
LOOK
--
!
''
She
looked
,
even
as
I
did
,
and
gave
me
,
with
her
deep
*NL*
groan
of
negation
,
repulsion
,
compassion
--
the
mixture
with
her
pity
of
*NL*
her
relief
at
her
exemption
--
a
sense
,
touching
to
me
even
then
,
that
she
*NL*
would
have
backed
me
up
if
she
could
.
I
might
well
have
needed
that
,
for
*NL*
with
this
hard
blow
of
the
proof
that
her
eyes
were
hopelessly
sealed
*NL*
I
felt
my
own
situation
horribly
crumble
,
I
felt
--
I
saw
--
my
livid
*NL*
predecessor
press
,
from
her
position
,
on
my
defeat
,
and
I
was
conscious
,
*NL*
more
than
all
,
of
what
I
should
have
from
this
instant
to
deal
with
in
*NL*
the
astounding
little
attitude
of
Flora
.
Into
this
attitude
Mrs.
Grose
*NL*
immediately
and
violently
entered
,
breaking
,
even
while
there
pierced
*NL*
through
my
sense
of
ruin
a
prodigious
private
triumph
,
into
breathless
*NL*
reassurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
n't
there
,
little
lady
,
and
nobody
's
there
--
and
you
never
see
*NL*
nothing
,
my
sweet
!
How
can
poor
Miss
Jessel
--
when
poor
Miss
Jessel
's
*NL*
dead
and
buried
?
WE
know
,
do
n't
we
,
love
?
''
--
and
she
appealed
,
blundering
*NL*
in
,
to
the
child
.
``
It
's
all
a
mere
mistake
and
a
worry
and
a
joke
--
and
*NL*
we
'll
go
home
as
fast
as
we
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
companion
,
on
this
,
had
responded
with
a
strange
,
quick
primness
of
*NL*
propriety
,
and
they
were
again
,
with
Mrs.
Grose
on
her
feet
,
united
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
in
pained
opposition
to
me
.
Flora
continued
to
fix
me
with
*NL*
her
small
mask
of
reprobation
,
and
even
at
that
minute
I
prayed
God
to
*NL*
forgive
me
for
seeming
to
see
that
,
as
she
stood
there
holding
tight
*NL*
to
our
friend
's
dress
,
her
incomparable
childish
beauty
had
suddenly
*NL*
failed
,
had
quite
vanished
.
I
've
said
it
already
--
she
was
literally
,
*NL*
she
was
hideously
,
hard
;
she
had
turned
common
and
almost
ugly
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
you
mean
.
I
see
nobody
.
I
see
nothing
.
I
never
HAVE
.
I
think
*NL*
you
're
cruel
.
I
do
n't
like
you
!
''
Then
,
after
this
deliverance
,
which
*NL*
might
have
been
that
of
a
vulgarly
pert
little
girl
in
the
street
,
she
*NL*
hugged
Mrs.
Grose
more
closely
and
buried
in
her
skirts
the
dreadful
*NL*
little
face
.
In
this
position
she
produced
an
almost
furious
wail
.
``
Take
*NL*
me
away
,
take
me
away
--
oh
,
take
me
away
from
HER
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
ME
?
''
I
panted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
you
--
from
you
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Mrs.
Grose
looked
across
at
me
dismayed
,
while
I
had
nothing
to
*NL*
do
but
communicate
again
with
the
figure
that
,
on
the
opposite
bank
,
*NL*
without
a
movement
,
as
rigidly
still
as
if
catching
,
beyond
the
*NL*
interval
,
our
voices
,
was
as
vividly
there
for
my
disaster
as
it
was
not
*NL*
there
for
my
service
.
The
wretched
child
had
spoken
exactly
as
if
she
*NL*
had
got
from
some
outside
source
each
of
her
stabbing
little
words
,
and
*NL*
I
could
therefore
,
in
the
full
despair
of
all
I
had
to
accept
,
but
sadly
*NL*
shake
my
head
at
her
.
``
If
I
had
ever
doubted
,
all
my
doubt
would
at
*NL*
present
have
gone
.
I
've
been
living
with
the
miserable
truth
,
and
now
*NL*
it
has
only
too
much
closed
round
me
.
Of
course
I
've
lost
you
:
I
've
*NL*
interfered
,
and
you
've
seen
--
under
HER
dictation
''
--
with
which
I
faced
,
*NL*
over
the
pool
again
,
our
infernal
witness
--
``
the
easy
and
perfect
way
to
*NL*
meet
it
.
I
've
done
my
best
,
but
I
've
lost
you
.
Goodbye
.
''
For
Mrs.
*NL*
Grose
I
had
an
imperative
,
an
almost
frantic
``
Go
,
go
!
''
before
which
,
in
*NL*
infinite
distress
,
but
mutely
possessed
of
the
little
girl
and
clearly
*NL*
convinced
,
in
spite
of
her
blindness
,
that
something
awful
had
occurred
*NL*
and
some
collapse
engulfed
us
,
she
retreated
,
by
the
way
we
had
come
,
as
*NL*
fast
as
she
could
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
what
first
happened
when
I
was
left
alone
I
had
no
subsequent
memory
.
*NL*
I
only
knew
that
at
the
end
of
,
I
suppose
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
an
*NL*
odorous
dampness
and
roughness
,
chilling
and
piercing
my
trouble
,
had
*NL*
made
me
understand
that
I
must
have
thrown
myself
,
on
my
face
,
on
the
*NL*
ground
and
given
way
to
a
wildness
of
grief
.
I
must
have
lain
there
long
*NL*
and
cried
and
sobbed
,
for
when
I
raised
my
head
the
day
was
almost
done
.
*NL*
I
got
up
and
looked
a
moment
,
through
the
twilight
,
at
the
gray
pool
and
*NL*
its
blank
,
haunted
edge
,
and
then
I
took
,
back
to
the
house
,
my
dreary
*NL*
and
difficult
course
.
When
I
reached
the
gate
in
the
fence
the
boat
,
*NL*
to
my
surprise
,
was
gone
,
so
that
I
had
a
fresh
reflection
to
make
on
*NL*
Flora
's
extraordinary
command
of
the
situation
.
She
passed
that
night
,
*NL*
by
the
most
tacit
,
and
I
should
add
,
were
not
the
word
so
grotesque
a
*NL*
false
note
,
the
happiest
of
arrangements
,
with
Mrs.
Grose
.
I
saw
*NL*
neither
of
them
on
my
return
,
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
as
by
an
ambiguous
*NL*
compensation
,
I
saw
a
great
deal
of
Miles
.
I
saw
--
I
can
use
no
other
*NL*
phrase
--
so
much
of
him
that
it
was
as
if
it
were
more
than
it
had
ever
*NL*
been
.
No
evening
I
had
passed
at
Bly
had
the
portentous
quality
of
*NL*
this
one
;
in
spite
of
which
--
and
in
spite
also
of
the
deeper
depths
of
*NL*
consternation
that
had
opened
beneath
my
feet
--
there
was
literally
,
in
*NL*
the
ebbing
actual
,
an
extraordinarily
sweet
sadness
.
On
reaching
the
*NL*
house
I
had
never
so
much
as
looked
for
the
boy
;
I
had
simply
gone
*NL*
straight
to
my
room
to
change
what
I
was
wearing
and
to
take
in
,
at
*NL*
a
glance
,
much
material
testimony
to
Flora
's
rupture
.
Her
little
*NL*
belongings
had
all
been
removed
.
When
later
,
by
the
schoolroom
fire
,
I
*NL*
was
served
with
tea
by
the
usual
maid
,
I
indulged
,
on
the
article
of
my
*NL*
other
pupil
,
in
no
inquiry
whatever
.
He
had
his
freedom
now
--
he
might
*NL*
have
it
to
the
end
!
Well
,
he
did
have
it
;
and
it
consisted
--
in
part
at
*NL*
least
--
of
his
coming
in
at
about
eight
o'clock
and
sitting
down
with
me
*NL*
in
silence
.
On
the
removal
of
the
tea
things
I
had
blown
out
the
candles
*NL*
and
drawn
my
chair
closer
:
I
was
conscious
of
a
mortal
coldness
and
felt
*NL*
as
if
I
should
never
again
be
warm
.
So
,
when
he
appeared
,
I
was
sitting
*NL*
in
the
glow
with
my
thoughts
.
He
paused
a
moment
by
the
door
as
if
to
*NL*
look
at
me
;
then
--
as
if
to
share
them
--
came
to
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
hearth
and
sank
into
a
chair
.
We
sat
there
in
absolute
stillness
;
yet
he
*NL*
wanted
,
I
felt
,
to
be
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
a
new
day
,
in
my
room
,
had
fully
broken
,
my
eyes
opened
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Grose
,
who
had
come
to
my
bedside
with
worse
news
.
Flora
was
so
markedly
*NL*
feverish
that
an
illness
was
perhaps
at
hand
;
she
had
passed
a
night
of
*NL*
extreme
unrest
,
a
night
agitated
above
all
by
fears
that
had
for
their
*NL*
subject
not
in
the
least
her
former
,
but
wholly
her
present
,
governess
.
*NL*
It
was
not
against
the
possible
re-entrance
of
Miss
Jessel
on
the
scene
*NL*
that
she
protested
--
it
was
conspicuously
and
passionately
against
mine
.
*NL*
I
was
promptly
on
my
feet
of
course
,
and
with
an
immense
deal
to
ask
;
*NL*
the
more
that
my
friend
had
discernibly
now
girded
her
loins
to
meet
me
*NL*
once
more
.
This
I
felt
as
soon
as
I
had
put
to
her
the
question
of
*NL*
her
sense
of
the
child
's
sincerity
as
against
my
own
.
``
She
persists
in
*NL*
denying
to
you
that
she
saw
,
or
has
ever
seen
,
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
visitor
's
trouble
,
truly
,
was
great
.
``
Ah
,
miss
,
it
is
n't
a
matter
*NL*
on
which
I
can
push
her
!
Yet
it
is
n't
either
,
I
must
say
,
as
if
I
much
*NL*
needed
to
.
It
has
made
her
,
every
inch
of
her
,
quite
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
see
her
perfectly
from
here
.
She
resents
,
for
all
the
world
like
*NL*
some
high
little
personage
,
the
imputation
on
her
truthfulness
and
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
her
respectability
.
`
Miss
Jessel
indeed
--
SHE
!
'
Ah
,
she
's
*NL*
`
respectable
,
'
the
chit
!
The
impression
she
gave
me
there
yesterday
was
,
*NL*
I
assure
you
,
the
very
strangest
of
all
;
it
was
quite
beyond
any
of
the
*NL*
others
.
I
DID
put
my
foot
in
it
!
She
'll
never
speak
to
me
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hideous
and
obscure
as
it
all
was
,
it
held
Mrs.
Grose
briefly
silent
;
*NL*
then
she
granted
my
point
with
a
frankness
which
,
I
made
sure
,
had
more
*NL*
behind
it
.
``
I
think
indeed
,
miss
,
she
never
will
.
She
do
have
a
grand
*NL*
manner
about
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
manner
''
--
I
summed
it
up
--
``
is
practically
what
's
the
matter
*NL*
with
her
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
that
manner
,
I
could
see
in
my
visitor
's
face
,
and
not
a
little
else
*NL*
besides
!
``
She
asks
me
every
three
minutes
if
I
think
you
're
coming
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
--
I
see
.
''
I
,
too
,
on
my
side
,
had
so
much
more
than
worked
it
*NL*
out
.
``
Has
she
said
to
you
since
yesterday
--
except
to
repudiate
her
*NL*
familiarity
with
anything
so
dreadful
--
a
single
other
word
about
Miss
*NL*
Jessel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
one
,
miss
.
And
of
course
you
know
,
''
my
friend
added
,
``
I
took
it
*NL*
from
her
,
by
the
lake
,
that
,
just
then
and
there
at
least

there
WAS
*NL*
nobody

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
!
and
,
naturally
,
you
take
it
from
her
still

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
contradict
her
.
What
else
can
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

the
world
!
You
've
the
cleverest
little
person
to
deal
with

*NL*
They
've
made
them
--
their
two
friends
,
I
mean
--
still
cleverer
even
than
*NL*
nature
did
;
for
it
was
wondrous
material
to
play
on
!
Flora
has
now
her
*NL*
grievance
,
and
she
'll
work
it
to
the
end

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
miss
;
but
to
WHAT
end
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
of
dealing
with
me
to
her
uncle

She
'll
make
me
out
to
him
*NL*
the
lowest
creature

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
winced
at
the
fair
show
of
the
scene
in
Mrs.
Grose
's
face
;
she
looked
*NL*
for
a
minute
as
if
she
sharply
saw
them
together
.
``
And
him
who
thinks
so
*NL*
well
of
you
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
an
odd
way
--
it
comes
over
me
now

I
laughed
,
''
--
of
proving
it
!
*NL*
But
that
does
n't
matter
.
What
Flora
wants
,
of
course
,
is
to
get
rid
of
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
companion
bravely
concurred
.
``
Never
again
to
so
much
as
look
at
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
what
you
've
come
to
me
now
for

I
asked
,
``
is
to
speed
me
on
my
*NL*
way

Before
she
had
time
to
reply
,
however
,
I
had
her
in
check
.
``
I
've
a
*NL*
better
idea

the
result

my
reflections

My
going

seem
the

on
Sunday
I
was
terribly
near
it

Yet
that

My
visitor
,
at
this
,
did
speculate
.
``
But

``
Away

She
was
still
vague

*NL*
``
Your
loyalty
,
to
begin
with
.
And
then
Miles
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
me
hard
.
``
Do
you
think
he
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
,
if
he
has
the
chance
,
turn
on
me
?
Yes
,
I
venture
still
to
think
*NL*
it
.
At
all
events
,
I
want
to
try
.
Get
off
with
his
sister
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
and
leave
me
with
him
alone
.
''
I
was
amazed
,
myself
,
at
the
*NL*
spirit
I
had
still
in
reserve
,
and
therefore
perhaps
a
trifle
the
more
*NL*
disconcerted
at
the
way
in
which
,
in
spite
of
this
fine
example
of
it
,
*NL*
she
hesitated
.
``
There
's
one
thing
,
of
course
,
''
I
went
on
:
``
they
must
n't
,
*NL*
before
she
goes
,
see
each
other
for
three
seconds
.
''
Then
it
came
over
me
*NL*
that
,
in
spite
of
Flora
's
presumable
sequestration
from
the
instant
of
*NL*
her
return
from
the
pool
,
it
might
already
be
too
late
.
``
Do
you
mean
,
''
I
*NL*
anxiously
asked
,
``
that
they
HAVE
met
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
she
quite
flushed
.
``
Ah
,
miss
,
I
'm
not
such
a
fool
as
that
!
If
*NL*
I
've
been
obliged
to
leave
her
three
or
four
times
,
it
has
been
each
*NL*
time
with
one
of
the
maids
,
and
at
present
,
though
she
's
alone
,
she
's
*NL*
locked
in
safe
.
And
yet
--
and
yet
!
''
There
were
too
many
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
are
you
so
sure
of
the
little
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
of
anything
but
YOU
.
But
I
have
,
since
last
evening
,
a
new
*NL*
hope
.
I
think
he
wants
to
give
me
an
opening
.
I
do
believe
that
--
poor
*NL*
little
exquisite
wretch
!
--
he
wants
to
speak
.
Last
evening
,
in
the
*NL*
firelight
and
the
silence
,
he
sat
with
me
for
two
hours
as
if
it
were
*NL*
just
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grose
looked
hard
,
through
the
window
,
at
the
gray
,
gathering
day
.
*NL*
``
And
did
it
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
though
I
waited
and
waited
,
I
confess
it
did
n't
,
and
it
was
without
*NL*
a
breach
of
the
silence
or
so
much
as
a
faint
allusion
to
his
sister
's
*NL*
condition
and
absence
that
we
at
last
kissed
for
good
night
.
All
the
*NL*
same
,
''
I
continued
,
``
I
ca
n't
,
if
her
uncle
sees
her
,
consent
to
his
*NL*
seeing
her
brother
without
my
having
given
the
boy
--
and
most
of
all
*NL*
because
things
have
got
so
bad
--
a
little
more
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
friend
appeared
on
this
ground
more
reluctant
than
I
could
quite
*NL*
understand
.
``
What
do
you
mean
by
more
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
a
day
or
two
--
really
to
bring
it
out
.
He
'll
then
be
on
MY
*NL*
side
--
of
which
you
see
the
importance
.
If
nothing
comes
,
I
shall
only
*NL*
fail
,
and
you
will
,
at
the
worst
,
have
helped
me
by
doing
,
on
your
*NL*
arrival
in
town
,
whatever
you
may
have
found
possible
.
''
So
I
put
it
*NL*
before
her
,
but
she
continued
for
a
little
so
inscrutably
embarrassed
*NL*
that
I
came
again
to
her
aid
.
``
Unless
,
indeed
,
''
I
wound
up
,
``
you
really
*NL*
want
NOT
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
see
it
,
in
her
face
,
at
last
clear
itself
;
she
put
out
her
hand
*NL*
to
me
as
a
pledge
.
``
I
'll
go
--
I
'll
go
.
I
'll
go
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
wanted
to
be
very
just
.
``
If
you
SHOULD
wish
still
to
wait
,
I
would
*NL*
engage
she
should
n't
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
:
it
's
the
place
itself
.
She
must
leave
it
.
''
She
held
me
a
moment
*NL*
with
heavy
eyes
,
then
brought
out
the
rest
.
``
Your
idea
's
the
right
one
.
*NL*
I
myself
,
miss
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
look
she
gave
me
with
it
made
me
jump
at
possibilities
.
``
You
mean
*NL*
that
,
since
yesterday
,
you
HAVE
seen
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
with
dignity
.
``
I
've
HEARD
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
that
child
--
horrors
!
There
!
''
she
sighed
with
tragic
relief
.
``
On
my
*NL*
honor
,
miss
,
she
says
things
--
!
''
But
at
this
evocation
she
broke
down
;
*NL*
she
dropped
,
with
a
sudden
sob
,
upon
my
sofa
and
,
as
I
had
seen
her
do
*NL*
before
,
gave
way
to
all
the
grief
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
in
another
manner
that
I
,
for
my
part
,
let
myself
go
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
thank
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sprang
up
again
at
this
,
drying
her
eyes
with
a
groan
.
''
`
Thank
*NL*
God
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
so
justifies
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
that
,
miss
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
n't
have
desired
more
emphasis
,
but
I
just
hesitated
.
``
She
's
so
*NL*
horrible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
my
colleague
scarce
knew
how
to
put
it
.
``
Really
shocking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
about
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
you
,
miss
--
since
you
must
have
it
.
It
's
beyond
everything
,
for
a
*NL*
young
lady
;
and
I
ca
n't
think
wherever
she
must
have
picked
up
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
appalling
language
she
applied
to
me
?
I
can
,
then
!
''
I
broke
in
with
*NL*
a
laugh
that
was
doubtless
significant
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
only
,
in
truth
,
left
my
friend
still
more
grave
.
``
Well
,
perhaps
I
*NL*
ought
to
also
--
since
I
've
heard
some
of
it
before
!
Yet
I
ca
n't
bear
it
,
''
*NL*
the
poor
woman
went
on
while
,
with
the
same
movement
,
she
glanced
,
on
my
*NL*
dressing
table
,
at
the
face
of
my
watch
.
``
But
I
must
go
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
kept
her
,
however
.
``
Ah
,
if
you
ca
n't
bear
it
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
stop
with
her
,
you
mean
?
Why
,
just
FOR
that
:
to
get
her
away
.
*NL*
Far
from
this
,
''
she
pursued
,
``
far
from
THEM
-
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
may
be
different
?
She
may
be
free
?
''
I
seized
her
almost
with
joy
.
*NL*
``
Then
,
in
spite
of
yesterday
,
you
BELIEVE
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
such
doings
?
''
Her
simple
description
of
them
required
,
in
the
light
*NL*
of
her
expression
,
to
be
carried
no
further
,
and
she
gave
me
the
whole
*NL*
thing
as
she
had
never
done
.
``
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
it
was
a
joy
,
and
we
were
still
shoulder
to
shoulder
:
if
I
might
*NL*
continue
sure
of
that
I
should
care
but
little
what
else
happened
.
My
*NL*
support
in
the
presence
of
disaster
would
be
the
same
as
it
had
been
*NL*
in
my
early
need
of
confidence
,
and
if
my
friend
would
answer
for
my
*NL*
honesty
,
I
would
answer
for
all
the
rest
.
On
the
point
of
taking
leave
*NL*
of
her
,
nonetheless
,
I
was
to
some
extent
embarrassed
.
``
There
's
one
*NL*
thing
,
of
course
--
it
occurs
to
me
--
to
remember
.
My
letter
,
giving
the
*NL*
alarm
,
will
have
reached
town
before
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
perceived
still
more
how
she
had
been
beating
about
the
bush
and
*NL*
how
weary
at
last
it
had
made
her
.
``
Your
letter
wo
n't
have
got
there
.
*NL*
Your
letter
never
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
became
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
knows
!
Master
Miles
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
HE
took
it
?
''
I
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hung
fire
,
but
she
overcame
her
reluctance
.
``
I
mean
that
I
saw
*NL*
yesterday
,
when
I
came
back
with
Miss
Flora
,
that
it
was
n't
where
you
*NL*
had
put
it
.
Later
in
the
evening
I
had
the
chance
to
question
Luke
,
and
*NL*
he
declared
that
he
had
neither
noticed
nor
touched
it
.
''
We
could
only
*NL*
exchange
,
on
this
,
one
of
our
deeper
mutual
soundings
,
and
it
was
Mrs.
*NL*
Grose
who
first
brought
up
the
plumb
with
an
almost
elated
``
You
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
see
that
if
Miles
took
it
instead
he
probably
will
have
read
it
*NL*
and
destroyed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
you
see
anything
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
faced
her
a
moment
with
a
sad
smile
.
``
It
strikes
me
that
by
this
time
*NL*
your
eyes
are
open
even
wider
than
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
proved
to
be
so
indeed
,
but
she
could
still
blush
,
almost
,
to
show
*NL*
it
.
``
I
make
out
now
what
he
must
have
done
at
school
.
''
And
she
gave
,
in
*NL*
her
simple
sharpness
,
an
almost
droll
disillusioned
nod
.
``
He
stole
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
it
over
--
I
tried
to
be
more
judicial
.
``
Well
--
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
as
if
she
found
me
unexpectedly
calm
.
``
He
stole
LETTERS
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
n't
know
my
reasons
for
a
calmness
after
all
pretty
shallow
;
so
*NL*
I
showed
them
off
as
I
might
.
``
I
hope
then
it
was
to
more
purpose
than
*NL*
in
this
case
!
The
note
,
at
any
rate
,
that
I
put
on
the
table
yesterday
,
''
*NL*
I
pursued
,
``
will
have
given
him
so
scant
an
advantage
--
for
it
contained
*NL*
only
the
bare
demand
for
an
interview
--
that
he
is
already
much
ashamed
*NL*
of
having
gone
so
far
for
so
little
,
and
that
what
he
had
on
his
mind
*NL*
last
evening
was
precisely
the
need
of
confession
.
''
I
seemed
to
myself
,
*NL*
for
the
instant
,
to
have
mastered
it
,
to
see
it
all
.
``
Leave
us
,
leave
*NL*
us
''
--
I
was
already
,
at
the
door
,
hurrying
her
off
.
``
I
'll
get
it
out
of
*NL*
him
.
He
'll
meet
me
--
he
'll
confess
.
If
he
confesses
,
he
's
saved
.
And
if
*NL*
he
's
saved
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
YOU
are
?
''
The
dear
woman
kissed
me
on
this
,
and
I
took
her
*NL*
farewell
.
``
I
'll
save
you
without
him
!
''
she
cried
as
she
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
it
was
when
she
had
got
off
--
and
I
missed
her
on
the
spot
--
that
the
*NL*
great
pinch
really
came
.
If
I
had
counted
on
what
it
would
give
me
to
*NL*
find
myself
alone
with
Miles
,
I
speedily
perceived
,
at
least
,
that
it
*NL*
would
give
me
a
measure
.
No
hour
of
my
stay
in
fact
was
so
assailed
*NL*
with
apprehensions
as
that
of
my
coming
down
to
learn
that
the
carriage
*NL*
containing
Mrs.
Grose
and
my
younger
pupil
had
already
rolled
out
of
the
*NL*
gates
.
Now
I
WAS
,
I
said
to
myself
,
face
to
face
with
the
elements
,
and
*NL*
for
much
of
the
rest
of
the
day
,
while
I
fought
my
weakness
,
I
could
*NL*
consider
that
I
had
been
supremely
rash
.
It
was
a
tighter
place
still
*NL*
than
I
had
yet
turned
round
in
;
all
the
more
that
,
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
I
could
see
in
the
aspect
of
others
a
confused
reflection
of
the
crisis
.
*NL*
What
had
happened
naturally
caused
them
all
to
stare
;
there
was
too
*NL*
little
of
the
explained
,
throw
out
whatever
we
might
,
in
the
suddenness
*NL*
of
my
colleague
's
act
.
The
maids
and
the
men
looked
blank
;
the
effect
*NL*
of
which
on
my
nerves
was
an
aggravation
until
I
saw
the
necessity
of
*NL*
making
it
a
positive
aid
.
It
was
precisely
,
in
short
,
by
just
clutching
*NL*
the
helm
that
I
avoided
total
wreck
;
and
I
dare
say
that
,
to
bear
up
*NL*
at
all
,
I
became
,
that
morning
,
very
grand
and
very
dry
.
I
welcomed
the
*NL*
consciousness
that
I
was
charged
with
much
to
do
,
and
I
caused
it
to
be
*NL*
known
as
well
that
,
left
thus
to
myself
,
I
was
quite
remarkably
firm
.
I
*NL*
wandered
with
that
manner
,
for
the
next
hour
or
two
,
all
over
the
place
*NL*
and
looked
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
as
if
I
were
ready
for
any
onset
.
So
,
for
*NL*
the
benefit
of
whom
it
might
concern
,
I
paraded
with
a
sick
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
person
it
appeared
least
to
concern
proved
to
be
,
till
dinner
,
*NL*
little
Miles
himself
.
My
perambulations
had
given
me
,
meanwhile
,
no
*NL*
glimpse
of
him
,
but
they
had
tended
to
make
more
public
the
change
*NL*
taking
place
in
our
relation
as
a
consequence
of
his
having
at
the
*NL*
piano
,
the
day
before
,
kept
me
,
in
Flora
's
interest
,
so
beguiled
and
*NL*
befooled
.
The
stamp
of
publicity
had
of
course
been
fully
given
by
her
*NL*
confinement
and
departure
,
and
the
change
itself
was
now
ushered
in
*NL*
by
our
nonobservance
of
the
regular
custom
of
the
schoolroom
.
He
had
*NL*
already
disappeared
when
,
on
my
way
down
,
I
pushed
open
his
door
,
and
*NL*
I
learned
below
that
he
had
breakfasted
--
in
the
presence
of
a
couple
of
*NL*
the
maids
--
with
Mrs.
Grose
and
his
sister
.
He
had
then
gone
out
,
as
he
*NL*
said
,
for
a
stroll
;
than
which
nothing
,
I
reflected
,
could
better
have
*NL*
expressed
his
frank
view
of
the
abrupt
transformation
of
my
office
.
What
*NL*
he
would
not
permit
this
office
to
consist
of
was
yet
to
be
settled
:
*NL*
there
was
a
queer
relief
,
at
all
events
--
I
mean
for
myself
in
*NL*
especial
--
in
the
renouncement
of
one
pretension
.
If
so
much
had
sprung
*NL*
to
the
surface
,
I
scarce
put
it
too
strongly
in
saying
that
what
had
*NL*
perhaps
sprung
highest
was
the
absurdity
of
our
prolonging
the
fiction
*NL*
that
I
had
anything
more
to
teach
him
.
It
sufficiently
stuck
out
that
,
*NL*
by
tacit
little
tricks
in
which
even
more
than
myself
he
carried
out
the
*NL*
care
for
my
dignity
,
I
had
had
to
appeal
to
him
to
let
me
off
straining
*NL*
to
meet
him
on
the
ground
of
his
true
capacity
.
He
had
at
any
rate
*NL*
his
freedom
now
;
I
was
never
to
touch
it
again
;
as
I
had
amply
shown
,
*NL*
moreover
,
when
,
on
his
joining
me
in
the
schoolroom
the
previous
night
,
*NL*
I
had
uttered
,
on
the
subject
of
the
interval
just
concluded
,
neither
*NL*
challenge
nor
hint
.
I
had
too
much
,
from
this
moment
,
my
other
ideas
.
*NL*
Yet
when
he
at
last
arrived
,
the
difficulty
of
applying
them
,
the
*NL*
accumulations
of
my
problem
,
were
brought
straight
home
to
me
by
the
*NL*
beautiful
little
presence
on
which
what
had
occurred
had
as
yet
,
for
the
*NL*
eye
,
dropped
neither
stain
nor
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
mark
,
for
the
house
,
the
high
state
I
cultivated
I
decreed
that
my
*NL*
meals
with
the
boy
should
be
served
,
as
we
called
it
,
downstairs
;
so
*NL*
that
I
had
been
awaiting
him
in
the
ponderous
pomp
of
the
room
outside
*NL*
of
the
window
of
which
I
had
had
from
Mrs.
Grose
,
that
first
scared
*NL*
Sunday
,
my
flash
of
something
it
would
scarce
have
done
to
call
light
.
*NL*
Here
at
present
I
felt
afresh
--
for
I
had
felt
it
again
and
again
--
how
my
*NL*
equilibrium
depended
on
the
success
of
my
rigid
will
,
the
will
to
shut
*NL*
my
eyes
as
tight
as
possible
to
the
truth
that
what
I
had
to
deal
with
*NL*
was
,
revoltingly
,
against
nature
.
I
could
only
get
on
at
all
by
taking
*NL*
``
nature
''
into
my
confidence
and
my
account
,
by
treating
my
monstrous
*NL*
ordeal
as
a
push
in
a
direction
unusual
,
of
course
,
and
unpleasant
,
but
*NL*
demanding
,
after
all
,
for
a
fair
front
,
only
another
turn
of
the
screw
*NL*
of
ordinary
human
virtue
.
No
attempt
,
nonetheless
,
could
well
require
*NL*
more
tact
than
just
this
attempt
to
supply
,
one
's
self
,
ALL
the
nature
.
*NL*
How
could
I
put
even
a
little
of
that
article
into
a
suppression
of
*NL*
reference
to
what
had
occurred
?
How
,
on
the
other
hand
,
could
I
make
*NL*
reference
without
a
new
plunge
into
the
hideous
obscure
?
Well
,
a
sort
*NL*
of
answer
,
after
a
time
,
had
come
to
me
,
and
it
was
so
far
confirmed
as
*NL*
that
I
was
met
,
incontestably
,
by
the
quickened
vision
of
what
was
rare
*NL*
in
my
little
companion
.
It
was
indeed
as
if
he
had
found
even
now
--
as
he
*NL*
had
so
often
found
at
lessons
--
still
some
other
delicate
way
to
ease
me
*NL*
off
.
Was
n't
there
light
in
the
fact
which
,
as
we
shared
our
solitude
,
*NL*
broke
out
with
a
specious
glitter
it
had
never
yet
quite
worn
?
--
the
fact
*NL*
that
-LRB-
opportunity
aiding
,
precious
opportunity
which
had
now
come
-RRB-
it
*NL*
would
be
preposterous
,
with
a
child
so
endowed
,
to
forego
the
help
one
*NL*
might
wrest
from
absolute
intelligence
?
What
had
his
intelligence
been
*NL*
given
him
for
but
to
save
him
?
Might
n't
one
,
to
reach
his
mind
,
risk
the
*NL*
stretch
of
an
angular
arm
over
his
character
?
It
was
as
if
,
when
we
were
*NL*
face
to
face
in
the
dining
room
,
he
had
literally
shown
me
the
way
.
*NL*
The
roast
mutton
was
on
the
table
,
and
I
had
dispensed
with
attendance
.
*NL*
Miles
,
before
he
sat
down
,
stood
a
moment
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
*NL*
and
looked
at
the
joint
,
on
which
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
passing
some
*NL*
humorous
judgment
.
But
what
he
presently
produced
was
:
``
I
say
,
my
dear
,
*NL*
is
she
really
very
awfully
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
Flora
?
Not
so
bad
but
that
she
'll
presently
be
better
.
London
*NL*
will
set
her
up
.
Bly
had
ceased
to
agree
with
her
.
Come
here
and
take
*NL*
your
mutton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
alertly
obeyed
me
,
carried
the
plate
carefully
to
his
seat
,
and
,
*NL*
when
he
was
established
,
went
on
.
``
Did
Bly
disagree
with
her
so
terribly
*NL*
suddenly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
suddenly
as
you
might
think
.
One
had
seen
it
coming
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
n't
you
get
her
off
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
she
became
too
ill
to
travel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
myself
prompt
.
``
She
's
NOT
too
ill
to
travel
:
she
only
might
*NL*
have
become
so
if
she
had
stayed
.
This
was
just
the
moment
to
seize
.
The
*NL*
journey
will
dissipate
the
influence
''
--
oh
,
I
was
grand
!
--
``
and
carry
it
*NL*
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
I
see
''
--
Miles
,
for
that
matter
,
was
grand
,
too
.
He
settled
to
*NL*
his
repast
with
the
charming
little
``
table
manner
''
that
,
from
the
day
of
*NL*
his
arrival
,
had
relieved
me
of
all
grossness
of
admonition
.
Whatever
*NL*
he
had
been
driven
from
school
for
,
it
was
not
for
ugly
feeding
.
He
*NL*
was
irreproachable
,
as
always
,
today
;
but
he
was
unmistakably
more
*NL*
conscious
.
He
was
discernibly
trying
to
take
for
granted
more
things
*NL*
than
he
found
,
without
assistance
,
quite
easy
;
and
he
dropped
into
*NL*
peaceful
silence
while
he
felt
his
situation
.
Our
meal
was
of
the
*NL*
briefest
--
mine
a
vain
pretense
,
and
I
had
the
things
immediately
*NL*
removed
.
While
this
was
done
Miles
stood
again
with
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
little
pockets
and
his
back
to
me
--
stood
and
looked
out
of
the
wide
*NL*
window
through
which
,
that
other
day
,
I
had
seen
what
pulled
me
up
.
We
*NL*
continued
silent
while
the
maid
was
with
us
--
as
silent
,
it
whimsically
*NL*
occurred
to
me
,
as
some
young
couple
who
,
on
their
wedding
journey
,
at
*NL*
the
inn
,
feel
shy
in
the
presence
of
the
waiter
.
He
turned
round
only
*NL*
when
the
waiter
had
left
us
.
``
Well
--
so
we
're
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
more
or
less
.
''
I
fancy
my
smile
was
pale
.
``
Not
absolutely
.
We
*NL*
should
n't
like
that
!
''
I
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
suppose
we
should
n't
.
Of
course
we
have
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
the
others
--
we
have
indeed
the
others
,
''
I
concurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
even
though
we
have
them
,
''
he
returned
,
still
with
his
hands
in
*NL*
his
pockets
and
planted
there
in
front
of
me
,
``
they
do
n't
much
count
,
do
*NL*
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
the
best
of
it
,
but
I
felt
wan
.
``
It
depends
on
what
you
call
*NL*
`
much
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
''
--
with
all
accommodation
--
``
everything
depends
!
''
On
this
,
however
,
*NL*
he
faced
to
the
window
again
and
presently
reached
it
with
his
vague
,
*NL*
restless
,
cogitating
step
.
He
remained
there
awhile
,
with
his
forehead
*NL*
against
the
glass
,
in
contemplation
of
the
stupid
shrubs
I
knew
and
the
*NL*
dull
things
of
November
.
I
had
always
my
hypocrisy
of
``
work
,
''
behind
*NL*
which
,
now
,
I
gained
the
sofa
.
Steadying
myself
with
it
there
as
I
had
*NL*
repeatedly
done
at
those
moments
of
torment
that
I
have
described
as
the
*NL*
moments
of
my
knowing
the
children
to
be
given
to
something
from
which
*NL*
I
was
barred
,
I
sufficiently
obeyed
my
habit
of
being
prepared
for
the
*NL*
worst
.
But
an
extraordinary
impression
dropped
on
me
as
I
extracted
a
*NL*
meaning
from
the
boy
's
embarrassed
back
--
none
other
than
the
impression
*NL*
that
I
was
not
barred
now
.
This
inference
grew
in
a
few
minutes
to
sharp
*NL*
intensity
and
seemed
bound
up
with
the
direct
perception
that
it
was
*NL*
positively
HE
who
was
.
The
frames
and
squares
of
the
great
window
were
a
*NL*
kind
of
image
,
for
him
,
of
a
kind
of
failure
.
I
felt
that
I
saw
him
,
at
*NL*
any
rate
,
shut
in
or
shut
out
.
He
was
admirable
,
but
not
comfortable
:
I
*NL*
took
it
in
with
a
throb
of
hope
.
Was
n't
he
looking
,
through
the
haunted
*NL*
pane
,
for
something
he
could
n't
see
?
--
and
was
n't
it
the
first
time
in
*NL*
the
whole
business
that
he
had
known
such
a
lapse
?
The
first
,
the
very
*NL*
first
:
I
found
it
a
splendid
portent
.
It
made
him
anxious
,
though
he
*NL*
watched
himself
;
he
had
been
anxious
all
day
and
,
even
while
in
his
*NL*
usual
sweet
little
manner
he
sat
at
table
,
had
needed
all
his
small
*NL*
strange
genius
to
give
it
a
gloss
.
When
he
at
last
turned
round
to
meet
*NL*
me
,
it
was
almost
as
if
this
genius
had
succumbed
.
``
Well
,
I
think
I
'm
*NL*
glad
Bly
agrees
with
ME
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
certainly
seem
to
have
seen
,
these
twenty-four
hours
,
a
good
*NL*
deal
more
of
it
than
for
some
time
before
.
I
hope
,
''
I
went
on
bravely
,
*NL*
``
that
you
've
been
enjoying
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
've
been
ever
so
far
;
all
round
about
--
miles
and
miles
away
.
*NL*
I
've
never
been
so
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
really
a
manner
of
his
own
,
and
I
could
only
try
to
keep
up
with
*NL*
him
.
``
Well
,
do
you
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
there
smiling
;
then
at
last
he
put
into
two
words
--
``
Do
*NL*
YOU
?
''
--
more
discrimination
than
I
had
ever
heard
two
words
contain
.
*NL*
Before
I
had
time
to
deal
with
that
,
however
,
he
continued
as
if
with
*NL*
the
sense
that
this
was
an
impertinence
to
be
softened
.
``
Nothing
could
*NL*
be
more
charming
than
the
way
you
take
it
,
for
of
course
if
we
're
alone
*NL*
together
now
it
's
you
that
are
alone
most
.
But
I
hope
,
''
he
threw
in
,
*NL*
``
you
do
n't
particularly
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Having
to
do
with
you
?
''
I
asked
.
``
My
dear
child
,
how
can
I
help
*NL*
minding
?
Though
I
've
renounced
all
claim
to
your
company
--
you
're
so
*NL*
beyond
me
--
I
at
least
greatly
enjoy
it
.
What
else
should
I
stay
on
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
more
directly
,
and
the
expression
of
his
face
,
graver
*NL*
now
,
struck
me
as
the
most
beautiful
I
had
ever
found
in
it
.
``
You
stay
*NL*
on
just
for
THAT
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
I
stay
on
as
your
friend
and
from
the
tremendous
interest
*NL*
I
take
in
you
till
something
can
be
done
for
you
that
may
be
more
worth
*NL*
your
while
.
That
need
n't
surprise
you
.
''
My
voice
trembled
so
that
I
felt
*NL*
it
impossible
to
suppress
the
shake
.
``
Do
n't
you
remember
how
I
told
you
,
*NL*
when
I
came
and
sat
on
your
bed
the
night
of
the
storm
,
that
there
was
*NL*
nothing
in
the
world
I
would
n't
do
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
He
,
on
his
side
,
more
and
more
visibly
nervous
,
had
a
tone
*NL*
to
master
;
but
he
was
so
much
more
successful
than
I
that
,
laughing
out
*NL*
through
his
gravity
,
he
could
pretend
we
were
pleasantly
jesting
.
``
Only
*NL*
that
,
I
think
,
was
to
get
me
to
do
something
for
YOU
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
partly
to
get
you
to
do
something
,
''
I
conceded
.
``
But
,
you
know
,
*NL*
you
did
n't
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
he
said
with
the
brightest
superficial
eagerness
,
``
you
wanted
*NL*
me
to
tell
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
.
Out
,
straight
out
.
What
you
have
on
your
mind
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
,
is
THAT
what
you
've
stayed
over
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
with
a
gaiety
through
which
I
could
still
catch
the
finest
*NL*
little
quiver
of
resentful
passion
;
but
I
ca
n't
begin
to
express
the
*NL*
effect
upon
me
of
an
implication
of
surrender
even
so
faint
.
It
was
as
*NL*
if
what
I
had
yearned
for
had
come
at
last
only
to
astonish
me
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
yes
--
I
may
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
,
it
was
precisely
for
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
so
long
that
I
supposed
it
for
the
purpose
of
repudiating
the
*NL*
assumption
on
which
my
action
had
been
founded
;
but
what
he
finally
said
*NL*
was
:
``
Do
you
mean
now
--
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
could
n't
be
a
better
place
or
time
.
''
He
looked
round
him
*NL*
uneasily
,
and
I
had
the
rare
--
oh
,
the
queer
!
--
impression
of
the
very
*NL*
first
symptom
I
had
seen
in
him
of
the
approach
of
immediate
fear
.
*NL*
It
was
as
if
he
were
suddenly
afraid
of
me
--
which
struck
me
indeed
as
*NL*
perhaps
the
best
thing
to
make
him
.
Yet
in
the
very
pang
of
the
effort
*NL*
I
felt
it
vain
to
try
sternness
,
and
I
heard
myself
the
next
instant
so
*NL*
gentle
as
to
be
almost
grotesque
.
``
You
want
so
to
go
out
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Awfully
!
''
He
smiled
at
me
heroically
,
and
the
touching
little
bravery
*NL*
of
it
was
enhanced
by
his
actually
flushing
with
pain
.
He
had
picked
up
*NL*
his
hat
,
which
he
had
brought
in
,
and
stood
twirling
it
in
a
way
that
*NL*
gave
me
,
even
as
I
was
just
nearly
reaching
port
,
a
perverse
horror
of
*NL*
what
I
was
doing
.
To
do
it
in
ANY
way
was
an
act
of
violence
,
for
what
*NL*
did
it
consist
of
but
the
obtrusion
of
the
idea
of
grossness
and
guilt
*NL*
on
a
small
helpless
creature
who
had
been
for
me
a
revelation
of
the
*NL*
possibilities
of
beautiful
intercourse
?
Was
n't
it
base
to
create
for
a
*NL*
being
so
exquisite
a
mere
alien
awkwardness
?
I
suppose
I
now
read
into
*NL*
our
situation
a
clearness
it
could
n't
have
had
at
the
time
,
for
I
seem
*NL*
to
see
our
poor
eyes
already
lighted
with
some
spark
of
a
prevision
*NL*
of
the
anguish
that
was
to
come
.
So
we
circled
about
,
with
terrors
and
*NL*
scruples
,
like
fighters
not
daring
to
close
.
But
it
was
for
each
other
*NL*
we
feared
!
That
kept
us
a
little
longer
suspended
and
unbruised
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
everything
,
''
Miles
said
--
``
I
mean
I
'll
tell
you
anything
you
*NL*
like
.
You
'll
stay
on
with
me
,
and
we
shall
both
be
all
right
,
and
I
WILL
*NL*
tell
you
--
I
WILL
.
But
not
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
insistence
turned
him
from
me
and
kept
him
once
more
at
his
window
*NL*
in
a
silence
during
which
,
between
us
,
you
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
.
*NL*
Then
he
was
before
me
again
with
the
air
of
a
person
for
whom
,
outside
,
*NL*
someone
who
had
frankly
to
be
reckoned
with
was
waiting
.
``
I
have
to
see
*NL*
Luke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
yet
reduced
him
to
quite
so
vulgar
a
lie
,
and
I
felt
*NL*
proportionately
ashamed
.
But
,
horrible
as
it
was
,
his
lies
made
up
my
*NL*
truth
.
I
achieved
thoughtfully
a
few
loops
of
my
knitting
.
``
Well
,
then
,
*NL*
go
to
Luke
,
and
I
'll
wait
for
what
you
promise
.
Only
,
in
return
for
*NL*
that
,
satisfy
,
before
you
leave
me
,
one
very
much
smaller
request
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
as
if
he
felt
he
had
succeeded
enough
to
be
able
still
a
*NL*
little
to
bargain
.
``
Very
much
smaller
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
mere
fraction
of
the
whole
.
Tell
me
''
--
oh
,
my
work
preoccupied
*NL*
me
,
and
I
was
offhand
!
--
``
if
,
yesterday
afternoon
,
from
the
table
in
the
*NL*
hall
,
you
took
,
you
know
,
my
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
sense
of
how
he
received
this
suffered
for
a
minute
from
something
*NL*
that
I
can
describe
only
as
a
fierce
split
of
my
attention
--
a
stroke
*NL*
that
at
first
,
as
I
sprang
straight
up
,
reduced
me
to
the
mere
blind
*NL*
movement
of
getting
hold
of
him
,
drawing
him
close
,
and
,
while
I
just
*NL*
fell
for
support
against
the
nearest
piece
of
furniture
,
instinctively
*NL*
keeping
him
with
his
back
to
the
window
.
The
appearance
was
full
upon
us
*NL*
that
I
had
already
had
to
deal
with
here
:
Peter
Quint
had
come
into
view
*NL*
like
a
sentinel
before
a
prison
.
The
next
thing
I
saw
was
that
,
from
*NL*
outside
,
he
had
reached
the
window
,
and
then
I
knew
that
,
close
to
the
*NL*
glass
and
glaring
in
through
it
,
he
offered
once
more
to
the
room
his
*NL*
white
face
of
damnation
.
It
represents
but
grossly
what
took
place
*NL*
within
me
at
the
sight
to
say
that
on
the
second
my
decision
was
made
;
*NL*
yet
I
believe
that
no
woman
so
overwhelmed
ever
in
so
short
a
time
*NL*
recovered
her
grasp
of
the
ACT
.
It
came
to
me
in
the
very
horror
of
the
*NL*
immediate
presence
that
the
act
would
be
,
seeing
and
facing
what
I
saw
*NL*
and
faced
,
to
keep
the
boy
himself
unaware
.
The
inspiration
--
I
can
*NL*
call
it
by
no
other
name
--
was
that
I
felt
how
voluntarily
,
how
*NL*
transcendently
,
I
MIGHT
.
It
was
like
fighting
with
a
demon
for
a
*NL*
human
soul
,
and
when
I
had
fairly
so
appraised
it
I
saw
how
the
human
*NL*
soul
--
held
out
,
in
the
tremor
of
my
hands
,
at
arm
's
length
--
had
a
*NL*
perfect
dew
of
sweat
on
a
lovely
childish
forehead
.
The
face
that
was
*NL*
close
to
mine
was
as
white
as
the
face
against
the
glass
,
and
out
of
it
*NL*
presently
came
a
sound
,
not
low
nor
weak
,
but
as
if
from
much
further
*NL*
away
,
that
I
drank
like
a
waft
of
fragrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
took
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
,
with
a
moan
of
joy
,
I
enfolded
,
I
drew
him
close
;
and
while
*NL*
I
held
him
to
my
breast
,
where
I
could
feel
in
the
sudden
fever
of
his
*NL*
little
body
the
tremendous
pulse
of
his
little
heart
,
I
kept
my
eyes
on
*NL*
the
thing
at
the
window
and
saw
it
move
and
shift
its
posture
.
I
have
*NL*
likened
it
to
a
sentinel
,
but
its
slow
wheel
,
for
a
moment
,
was
rather
*NL*
the
prowl
of
a
baffled
beast
.
My
present
quickened
courage
,
however
,
was
*NL*
such
that
,
not
too
much
to
let
it
through
,
I
had
to
shade
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
my
flame
.
Meanwhile
the
glare
of
the
face
was
again
at
the
window
,
the
*NL*
scoundrel
fixed
as
if
to
watch
and
wait
.
It
was
the
very
confidence
that
*NL*
I
might
now
defy
him
,
as
well
as
the
positive
certitude
,
by
this
time
,
*NL*
of
the
child
's
unconsciousness
,
that
made
me
go
on
.
``
What
did
you
take
*NL*
it
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
what
you
said
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
opened
the
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
opened
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
eyes
were
now
,
as
I
held
him
off
a
little
again
,
on
Miles
's
own
face
,
*NL*
in
which
the
collapse
of
mockery
showed
me
how
complete
was
the
ravage
*NL*
of
uneasiness
.
What
was
prodigious
was
that
at
last
,
by
my
success
,
his
*NL*
sense
was
sealed
and
his
communication
stopped
:
he
knew
that
he
was
in
*NL*
presence
,
but
knew
not
of
what
,
and
knew
still
less
that
I
also
was
and
*NL*
that
I
did
know
.
And
what
did
this
strain
of
trouble
matter
when
my
eyes
*NL*
went
back
to
the
window
only
to
see
that
the
air
was
clear
again
and
--
by
*NL*
my
personal
triumph
--
the
influence
quenched
?
There
was
nothing
there
.
I
*NL*
felt
that
the
cause
was
mine
and
that
I
should
surely
get
ALL
.
``
And
you
*NL*
found
nothing
!
''
--
I
let
my
elation
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
the
most
mournful
,
thoughtful
little
headshake
.
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
nothing
!
''
I
almost
shouted
in
my
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
nothing
,
''
he
sadly
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
kissed
his
forehead
;
it
was
drenched
.
``
So
what
have
you
done
with
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
burned
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burned
it
?
''
It
was
now
or
never
.
``
Is
that
what
you
did
at
school
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
what
this
brought
up
!
``
At
school
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
take
letters
?
--
or
other
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Other
things
?
''
He
appeared
now
to
be
thinking
of
something
far
off
and
*NL*
that
reached
him
only
through
the
pressure
of
his
anxiety
.
Yet
it
did
*NL*
reach
him
.
``
Did
I
STEAL
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
myself
redden
to
the
roots
of
my
hair
as
well
as
wonder
if
it
*NL*
were
more
strange
to
put
to
a
gentleman
such
a
question
or
to
see
him
*NL*
take
it
with
allowances
that
gave
the
very
distance
of
his
fall
in
the
*NL*
world
.
``
Was
it
for
that
you
might
n't
go
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
thing
he
felt
was
rather
a
dreary
little
surprise
.
``
Did
you
*NL*
know
I
might
n't
go
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
me
at
this
the
longest
and
strangest
look
.
``
Everything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
.
Therefore
DID
you
--
?
''
But
I
could
n't
say
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miles
could
,
very
simply
.
``
No
.
I
did
n't
steal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
face
must
have
shown
him
I
believed
him
utterly
;
yet
my
hands
--
but
it
*NL*
was
for
pure
tenderness
--
shook
him
as
if
to
ask
him
why
,
if
it
was
all
*NL*
for
nothing
,
he
had
condemned
me
to
months
of
torment
.
``
What
then
did
*NL*
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
in
vague
pain
all
round
the
top
of
the
room
and
drew
his
*NL*
breath
,
two
or
three
times
over
,
as
if
with
difficulty
.
He
might
have
*NL*
been
standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
raising
his
eyes
to
some
*NL*
faint
green
twilight
.
``
Well
--
I
said
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
thought
it
was
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
turn
you
out
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Never
,
truly
,
had
a
person
``
turned
out
''
shown
so
little
to
explain
it
*NL*
as
this
little
person
!
He
appeared
to
weigh
my
question
,
but
in
a
manner
*NL*
quite
detached
and
almost
helpless
.
``
Well
,
I
suppose
I
ought
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
to
whom
did
you
say
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
evidently
tried
to
remember
,
but
it
dropped
--
he
had
lost
it
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
almost
smiled
at
me
in
the
desolation
of
his
surrender
,
which
was
*NL*
indeed
practically
,
by
this
time
,
so
complete
that
I
ought
to
have
left
*NL*
it
there
.
But
I
was
infatuated
--
I
was
blind
with
victory
,
though
even
*NL*
then
the
very
effect
that
was
to
have
brought
him
so
much
nearer
was
*NL*
already
that
of
added
separation
.
``
Was
it
to
everyone
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
it
was
only
to
--
''
But
he
gave
a
sick
little
headshake
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
remember
their
names
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
they
then
so
many
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
only
a
few
.
Those
I
liked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Those
he
liked
?
I
seemed
to
float
not
into
clearness
,
but
into
a
darker
*NL*
obscure
,
and
within
a
minute
there
had
come
to
me
out
of
my
very
pity
*NL*
the
appalling
alarm
of
his
being
perhaps
innocent
.
It
was
for
the
*NL*
instant
confounding
and
bottomless
,
for
if
he
WERE
innocent
,
what
then
*NL*
on
earth
was
_
I
_
?
Paralyzed
,
while
it
lasted
,
by
the
mere
brush
of
the
*NL*
question
,
I
let
him
go
a
little
,
so
that
,
with
a
deep-drawn
sigh
,
he
*NL*
turned
away
from
me
again
;
which
,
as
he
faced
toward
the
clear
window
,
*NL*
I
suffered
,
feeling
that
I
had
nothing
now
there
to
keep
him
from
.
``
And
*NL*
did
they
repeat
what
you
said
?
''
I
went
on
after
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
soon
at
some
distance
from
me
,
still
breathing
hard
and
again
*NL*
with
the
air
,
though
now
without
anger
for
it
,
of
being
confined
against
*NL*
his
will
.
Once
more
,
as
he
had
done
before
,
he
looked
up
at
the
dim
*NL*
day
as
if
,
of
what
had
hitherto
sustained
him
,
nothing
was
left
but
an
*NL*
unspeakable
anxiety
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
he
nevertheless
replied
--
``
they
must
have
*NL*
repeated
them
.
To
those
THEY
liked
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
somehow
,
less
of
it
than
I
had
expected
;
but
I
turned
it
*NL*
over
.
``
And
these
things
came
round
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
masters
?
Oh
,
yes
!
''
he
answered
very
simply
.
``
But
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
they
'd
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
masters
?
They
did
n't
--
they
've
never
told
.
That
's
why
I
ask
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
me
again
his
little
beautiful
fevered
face
.
``
Yes
,
it
was
*NL*
too
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
bad
?

``
What
I
suppose
I
sometimes
said
.
To
write
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
ca
n't
name
the
exquisite
pathos
of
the
contradiction
given
to
such
*NL*
a
speech
by
such
a
speaker
;
I
only
know
that
the
next
instant
I
heard
*NL*
myself
throw
off
with
homely
force
:
``
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
''
But
the
next
*NL*
after
that
I
must
have
sounded
stern
enough
.
``
What
WERE
these
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
sternness
was
all
for
his
judge
,
his
executioner
;
yet
it
made
him
*NL*
avert
himself
again
,
and
that
movement
made
ME
,
with
a
single
bound
and
*NL*
an
irrepressible
cry
,
spring
straight
upon
him
.
For
there
again
,
against
*NL*
the
glass
,
as
if
to
blight
his
confession
and
stay
his
answer
,
was
the
*NL*
hideous
author
of
our
woe
--
the
white
face
of
damnation
.
I
felt
a
sick
*NL*
swim
at
the
drop
of
my
victory
and
all
the
return
of
my
battle
,
so
that
*NL*
the
wildness
of
my
veritable
leap
only
served
as
a
great
betrayal
.
I
*NL*
saw
him
,
from
the
midst
of
my
act
,
meet
it
with
a
divination
,
and
on
the
*NL*
perception
that
even
now
he
only
guessed
,
and
that
the
window
was
still
*NL*
to
his
own
eyes
free
,
I
let
the
impulse
flame
up
to
convert
the
climax
*NL*
of
his
dismay
into
the
very
proof
of
his
liberation
.
``
No
more
,
no
*NL*
more
,
no
more
!
''
I
shrieked
,
as
I
tried
to
press
him
against
me
,
to
my
*NL*
visitant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
HERE
?
''
Miles
panted
as
he
caught
with
his
sealed
eyes
the
*NL*
direction
of
my
words
.
Then
as
his
strange
``
she
''
staggered
me
and
,
with
*NL*
a
gasp
,
I
echoed
it
,
``
Miss
Jessel
,
Miss
Jessel
!
''
he
with
a
sudden
fury
*NL*
gave
me
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
seized
,
stupefied
,
his
supposition
--
some
sequel
to
what
we
had
done
to
*NL*
Flora
,
but
this
made
me
only
want
to
show
him
that
it
was
better
still
*NL*
than
that
.
``
It
's
not
Miss
Jessel
!
But
it
's
at
the
window
--
straight
*NL*
before
us
.
It
's
THERE
--
the
coward
horror
,
there
for
the
last
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
,
after
a
second
in
which
his
head
made
the
movement
of
a
baffled
*NL*
dog
's
on
a
scent
and
then
gave
a
frantic
little
shake
for
air
and
light
,
*NL*
he
was
at
me
in
a
white
rage
,
bewildered
,
glaring
vainly
over
the
place
*NL*
and
missing
wholly
,
though
it
now
,
to
my
sense
,
filled
the
room
like
the
*NL*
taste
of
poison
,
the
wide
,
overwhelming
presence
.
``
It
's
HE
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
determined
to
have
all
my
proof
that
I
flashed
into
ice
to
*NL*
challenge
him
.
``
Whom
do
you
mean
by
`
he
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peter
Quint
--
you
devil
!
''
His
face
gave
again
,
round
the
room
,
its
*NL*
convulsed
supplication
.
``
WHERE
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
are
in
my
ears
still
,
his
supreme
surrender
of
the
name
and
his
*NL*
tribute
to
my
devotion
.
``
What
does
he
matter
now
,
my
own
?
--
what
will
he
*NL*
EVER
matter
?
_
I
_
have
you
,
''
I
launched
at
the
beast
,
``
but
he
has
lost
*NL*
you
forever
!
''
Then
,
for
the
demonstration
of
my
work
,
``
There
,
THERE
!
''
I
*NL*
said
to
Miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
already
jerked
straight
round
,
stared
,
glared
again
,
and
*NL*
seen
but
the
quiet
day
.
With
the
stroke
of
the
loss
I
was
so
proud
of
he
*NL*
uttered
the
cry
of
a
creature
hurled
over
an
abyss
,
and
the
grasp
with
*NL*
which
I
recovered
him
might
have
been
that
of
catching
him
in
his
fall
.
*NL*
I
caught
him
,
yes
,
I
held
him
--
it
may
be
imagined
with
what
a
passion
;
*NL*
but
at
the
end
of
a
minute
I
began
to
feel
what
it
truly
was
that
*NL*
I
held
.
We
were
alone
with
the
quiet
day
,
and
his
little
heart
,
*NL*
dispossessed
,
had
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
