CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
THERE
IS
NO

LEFT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mary
Lennox
was
sent
to
Misselthwaite
Manor
to
live
with
her
uncle
*NL*
everybody
said
she
was
the
most
disagreeable-looking
child
ever
seen
.
*NL*
It
was
true
,
too
.
She
had
a
little
thin
face
and
a
little
thin
body
,
*NL*
thin
light
hair
and
a
sour
expression
.
Her
hair
was
yellow
,
and
her
*NL*
face
was
yellow
because
she
had
been
born
in
India
and
had
always
been
*NL*
ill
in
one
way
or
another
.
Her
father
had
held
a
position
under
the
*NL*
English
Government
and
had
always
been
busy
and
ill
himself
,
and
her
*NL*
mother
had
been
a
great
beauty
who
cared
only
to
go
to
parties
and
*NL*
amuse
herself
with
gay
people
.
She
had
not
wanted
a
little
girl
at
*NL*
all
,
and
when
Mary
was
born
she
handed
her
over
to
the
care
of
an
Ayah
,
*NL*
who
was
made
to
understand
that
if
she
wished
to
please
the
Mem
Sahib
*NL*
she
must
keep
the
child
out
of
sight
as
much
as
possible
.
So
when
she
*NL*
was
a
sickly
,
fretful
,
ugly
little
baby
she
was
kept
out
of
the
way
,
*NL*
and
when
she
became
a
sickly
,
fretful
,
toddling
thing
she
was
kept
out
*NL*
of
the
way
also
.
She
never
remembered
seeing
familiarly
anything
but
*NL*
the
dark
faces
of
her
Ayah
and
the
other
native
servants
,
and
as
they
*NL*
always
obeyed
her
and
gave
her
her
own
way
in
everything
,
because
the
*NL*
Mem
Sahib
would
be
angry
if
she
was
disturbed
by
her
crying
,
by
the
*NL*
time
she
was
six
years
old
she
was
as
tyrannical
and
selfish
a
little
*NL*
pig
as
ever
lived
.
The
young
English
governess
who
came
to
teach
her
*NL*
to
read
and
write
disliked
her
so
much
that
she
gave
up
her
place
in
*NL*
three
months
,
and
when
other
governesses
came
to
try
to
fill
it
they
*NL*
always
went
away
in
a
shorter
time
than
the
first
one
.
So
if
Mary
had
*NL*
not
chosen
to
really
want
to
know
how
to
read
books
she
would
never
*NL*
have
learned
her
letters
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
frightfully
hot
morning
,
when
she
was
about
nine
years
old
,
she
*NL*
awakened
feeling
very
cross
,
and
she
became
crosser
still
when
she
saw
*NL*
that
the
servant
who
stood
by
her
bedside
was
not
her
Ayah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
come
?
''
she
said
to
the
strange
woman
.
``
I
will
not
let
you
*NL*
stay
.
Send
my
Ayah
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
looked
frightened
,
but
she
only
stammered
that
the
Ayah
could
*NL*
not
come
and
when
Mary
threw
herself
into
a
passion
and
beat
and
kicked
*NL*
her
,
she
looked
only
more
frightened
and
repeated
that
it
was
not
*NL*
possible
for
the
Ayah
to
come
to
Missie
Sahib
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
mysterious
in
the
air
that
morning
.
Nothing
was
*NL*
done
in
its
regular
order
and
several
of
the
native
servants
seemed
*NL*
missing
,
while
those
whom
Mary
saw
slunk
or
hurried
about
with
ashy
and
*NL*
scared
faces
.
But
no
one
would
tell
her
anything
and
her
Ayah
did
not
*NL*
come
.
She
was
actually
left
alone
as
the
morning
went
on
,
and
at
last
*NL*
she
wandered
out
into
the
garden
and
began
to
play
by
herself
under
a
*NL*
tree
near
the
veranda
.
She
pretended
that
she
was
making
a
flower-bed
,
*NL*
and
she
stuck
big
scarlet
hibiscus
blossoms
into
little
heaps
of
earth
,
*NL*
all
the
time
growing
more
and
more
angry
and
muttering
to
herself
the
*NL*
things
she
would
say
and
the
names
she
would
call
Saidie
when
she
*NL*
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pig
!
Pig
!
Daughter
of
Pigs
!
''
she
said
,
because
to
call
a
native
a
pig
*NL*
is
the
worst
insult
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
grinding
her
teeth
and
saying
this
over
and
over
again
when
she
*NL*
heard
her
mother
come
out
on
the
veranda
with
some
one
.
She
was
with
a
*NL*
fair
young
man
and
they
stood
talking
together
in
low
strange
voices
.
*NL*
Mary
knew
the
fair
young
man
who
looked
like
a
boy
.
She
had
heard
that
*NL*
he
was
a
very
young
officer
who
had
just
come
from
England
.
The
child
*NL*
stared
at
him
,
but
she
stared
most
at
her
mother
.
She
always
did
this
*NL*
when
she
had
a
chance
to
see
her
,
because
the
Mem
Sahib
--
Mary
used
to
*NL*
call
her
that
oftener
than
anything
else
--
was
such
a
tall
,
slim
,
pretty
*NL*
person
and
wore
such
lovely
clothes
.
Her
hair
was
like
curly
silk
and
*NL*
she
had
a
delicate
little
nose
which
seemed
to
be
disdaining
things
,
*NL*
and
she
had
large
laughing
eyes
.
All
her
clothes
were
thin
and
*NL*
floating
,
and
Mary
said
they
were
``
full
of
lace
.
''
They
looked
fuller
of
*NL*
lace
than
ever
this
morning
,
but
her
eyes
were
not
laughing
at
all
.
*NL*
They
were
large
and
scared
and
lifted
imploringly
to
the
fair
boy
*NL*
officer
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
so
very
bad
?
Oh
,
is
it
?
''
Mary
heard
her
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Awfully
,
''
the
young
man
answered
in
a
trembling
voice
.
``
Awfully
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Lennox
.
You
ought
to
have
gone
to
the
hills
two
weeks
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mem
Sahib
wrung
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
I
ought
!
''
she
cried
.
``
I
only
stayed
to
go
to
that
silly
*NL*
dinner
party
.
What
a
fool
I
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
very
moment
such
a
loud
sound
of
wailing
broke
out
from
the
*NL*
servants
'
quarters
that
she
clutched
the
young
man
's
arm
,
and
Mary
*NL*
stood
shivering
from
head
to
foot
.
The
wailing
grew
wilder
and
wilder
.
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
What
is
it
?
''
Mrs.
Lennox
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
has
died
,
''
answered
the
boy
officer
.
``
You
did
not
say
it
had
*NL*
broken
out
among
your
servants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
!
''
the
Mem
Sahib
cried
.
``
Come
with
me
!
Come
with
me
!
''
*NL*
and
she
turned
and
ran
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
,
appalling
things
happened
,
and
the
mysteriousness
of
the
*NL*
morning
was
explained
to
Mary
.
The
cholera
had
broken
out
in
its
most
*NL*
fatal
form
and
people
were
dying
like
flies
.
The
Ayah
had
been
taken
*NL*
ill
in
the
night
,
and
it
was
because
she
had
just
died
that
the
*NL*
servants
had
wailed
in
the
huts
.
Before
the
next
day
three
other
*NL*
servants
were
dead
and
others
had
run
away
in
terror
.
There
was
panic
*NL*
on
every
side
,
and
dying
people
in
all
the
bungalows
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
confusion
and
bewilderment
of
the
second
day
Mary
hid
*NL*
herself
in
the
nursery
and
was
forgotten
by
everyone
.
Nobody
thought
*NL*
of
her
,
nobody
wanted
her
,
and
strange
things
happened
of
which
she
*NL*
knew
nothing
.
Mary
alternately
cried
and
slept
through
the
hours
.
She
*NL*
only
knew
that
people
were
ill
and
that
she
heard
mysterious
and
*NL*
frightening
sounds
.
Once
she
crept
into
the
dining-room
and
found
it
*NL*
empty
,
though
a
partly
finished
meal
was
on
the
table
and
chairs
and
*NL*
plates
looked
as
if
they
had
been
hastily
pushed
back
when
the
diners
*NL*
rose
suddenly
for
some
reason
.
The
child
ate
some
fruit
and
biscuits
,
*NL*
and
being
thirsty
she
drank
a
glass
of
wine
which
stood
nearly
filled
.
*NL*
It
was
sweet
,
and
she
did
not
know
how
strong
it
was
.
Very
soon
it
*NL*
made
her
intensely
drowsy
,
and
she
went
back
to
her
nursery
and
shut
*NL*
herself
in
again
,
frightened
by
cries
she
heard
in
the
huts
and
by
the
*NL*
hurrying
sound
of
feet
.
The
wine
made
her
so
sleepy
that
she
could
*NL*
scarcely
keep
her
eyes
open
and
she
lay
down
on
her
bed
and
knew
*NL*
nothing
more
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
things
happened
during
the
hours
in
which
she
slept
so
heavily
,
*NL*
but
she
was
not
disturbed
by
the
wails
and
the
sound
of
things
being
*NL*
carried
in
and
out
of
the
bungalow
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
awakened
she
lay
and
stared
at
the
wall
.
The
house
was
*NL*
perfectly
still
.
She
had
never
known
it
to
be
so
silent
before
.
She
*NL*
heard
neither
voices
nor
footsteps
,
and
wondered
if
everybody
had
got
*NL*
well
of
the
cholera
and
all
the
trouble
was
over
.
She
wondered
also
*NL*
who
would
take
care
of
her
now
her
Ayah
was
dead
.
There
would
be
a
new
*NL*
Ayah
,
and
perhaps
she
would
know
some
new
stories
.
Mary
had
been
*NL*
rather
tired
of
the
old
ones
.
She
did
not
cry
because
her
nurse
had
*NL*
died
.
She
was
not
an
affectionate
child
and
had
never
cared
much
for
*NL*
any
one
.
The
noise
and
hurrying
about
and
wailing
over
the
cholera
had
*NL*
frightened
her
,
and
she
had
been
angry
because
no
one
seemed
to
*NL*
remember
that
she
was
alive
.
Everyone
was
too
panic-stricken
to
think
*NL*
of
a
little
girl
no
one
was
fond
of
.
When
people
had
the
cholera
it
*NL*
seemed
that
they
remembered
nothing
but
themselves
.
But
if
everyone
*NL*
had
got
well
again
,
surely
some
one
would
remember
and
come
to
look
for
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
one
came
,
and
as
she
lay
waiting
the
house
seemed
to
grow
more
*NL*
and
more
silent
.
She
heard
something
rustling
on
the
matting
and
when
*NL*
she
looked
down
she
saw
a
little
snake
gliding
along
and
watching
her
*NL*
with
eyes
like
jewels
.
She
was
not
frightened
,
because
he
was
a
*NL*
harmless
little
thing
who
would
not
hurt
her
and
he
seemed
in
a
hurry
*NL*
to
get
out
of
the
room
.
He
slipped
under
the
door
as
she
watched
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
queer
and
quiet
it
is
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
sounds
as
if
there
were
no
*NL*
one
in
the
bungalow
but
me
and
the
snake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
the
next
minute
she
heard
footsteps
in
the
compound
,
and
then
on
*NL*
the
veranda
.
They
were
men
's
footsteps
,
and
the
men
entered
the
*NL*
bungalow
and
talked
in
low
voices
.
No
one
went
to
meet
or
speak
to
*NL*
them
and
they
seemed
to
open
doors
and
look
into
rooms
.
``
What
*NL*
desolation
!
''
she
heard
one
voice
say
.
``
That
pretty
,
pretty
woman
!
I
*NL*
suppose
the
child
,
too
.
I
heard
there
was
a
child
,
though
no
one
ever
*NL*
saw
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
nursery
when
they
opened
the
*NL*
door
a
few
minutes
later
.
She
looked
an
ugly
,
cross
little
thing
and
*NL*
was
frowning
because
she
was
beginning
to
be
hungry
and
feel
*NL*
disgracefully
neglected
.
The
first
man
who
came
in
was
a
large
officer
*NL*
she
had
once
seen
talking
to
her
father
.
He
looked
tired
and
troubled
,
*NL*
but
when
he
saw
her
he
was
so
startled
that
he
almost
jumped
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Barney
!
''
he
cried
out
.
``
There
is
a
child
here
!
A
child
alone
!
In
a
*NL*
place
like
this
!
Mercy
on
us
,
who
is
she
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
Mary
Lennox
,
''
the
little
girl
said
,
drawing
herself
up
stiffly
.
*NL*
She
thought
the
man
was
very
rude
to
call
her
father
's
bungalow
``
A
*NL*
place
like
this
!
''
``
I
fell
asleep
when
everyone
had
the
cholera
and
I
*NL*
have
only
just
wakened
up
.
Why
does
nobody
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
child
no
one
ever
saw
!
''
exclaimed
the
man
,
turning
to
his
*NL*
companions
.
``
She
has
actually
been
forgotten
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
was
I
forgotten
?
''
Mary
said
,
stamping
her
foot
.
``
Why
does
nobody
*NL*
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
whose
name
was
Barney
looked
at
her
very
sadly
.
Mary
*NL*
even
thought
she
saw
him
wink
his
eyes
as
if
to
wink
tears
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
kid
!
''
he
said
.
``
There
is
nobody
left
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
that
strange
and
sudden
way
that
Mary
found
out
that
she
had
*NL*
neither
father
nor
mother
left
;
that
they
had
died
and
been
carried
*NL*
away
in
the
night
,
and
that
the
few
native
servants
who
had
not
died
*NL*
also
had
left
the
house
as
quickly
as
they
could
get
out
of
it
,
none
of
*NL*
them
even
remembering
that
there
was
a
Missie
Sahib
.
That
was
why
the
*NL*
place
was
so
quiet
.
It
was
true
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
bungalow
*NL*
but
herself
and
the
little
rustling
snake
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
MISTRESS
MARY
QUITE
CONTRARY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
liked
to
look
at
her
mother
from
a
distance
and
she
had
*NL*
thought
her
very
pretty
,
but
as
she
knew
very
little
of
her
she
could
*NL*
scarcely
have
been
expected
to
love
her
or
to
miss
her
very
much
when
*NL*
she
was
gone
.
She
did
not
miss
her
at
all
,
in
fact
,
and
as
she
was
a
*NL*
self-absorbed
child
she
gave
her
entire
thought
to
herself
,
as
she
had
*NL*
always
done
.
If
she
had
been
older
she
would
no
doubt
have
been
very
*NL*
anxious
at
being
left
alone
in
the
world
,
but
she
was
very
young
,
and
*NL*
as
she
had
always
been
taken
care
of
,
she
supposed
she
always
would
be
.
*NL*
What
she
thought
was
that
she
would
like
to
know
if
she
was
going
to
*NL*
nice
people
,
who
would
be
polite
to
her
and
give
her
her
own
way
as
her
*NL*
Ayah
and
the
other
native
servants
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
that
she
was
not
going
to
stay
at
the
English
clergyman
's
*NL*
house
where
she
was
taken
at
first
.
She
did
not
want
to
stay
.
The
*NL*
English
clergyman
was
poor
and
he
had
five
children
nearly
all
the
same
*NL*
age
and
they
wore
shabby
clothes
and
were
always
quarreling
and
*NL*
snatching
toys
from
each
other
.
Mary
hated
their
untidy
bungalow
and
*NL*
was
so
disagreeable
to
them
that
after
the
first
day
or
two
nobody
*NL*
would
play
with
her
.
By
the
second
day
they
had
given
her
a
nickname
*NL*
which
made
her
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Basil
who
thought
of
it
first
.
Basil
was
a
little
boy
with
*NL*
impudent
blue
eyes
and
a
turned-up
nose
,
and
Mary
hated
him
.
She
was
*NL*
playing
by
herself
under
a
tree
,
just
as
she
had
been
playing
the
day
*NL*
the
cholera
broke
out
.
She
was
making
heaps
of
earth
and
paths
for
a
*NL*
garden
and
Basil
came
and
stood
near
to
watch
her
.
Presently
he
got
*NL*
rather
interested
and
suddenly
made
a
suggestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
put
a
heap
of
stones
there
and
pretend
it
is
a
rockery
?
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
There
in
the
middle
,
''
and
he
leaned
over
her
to
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
!
''
cried
Mary
.
``
I
do
n't
want
boys
.
Go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
Basil
looked
angry
,
and
then
he
began
to
tease
.
He
was
*NL*
always
teasing
his
sisters
.
He
danced
round
and
round
her
and
made
*NL*
faces
and
sang
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mistress
Mary
,
quite
contrary
,
*NL*
How
does
your
garden
grow
?
*NL*
With
silver
bells
,
and
cockle
shells
,
*NL*
And
marigolds
all
in
a
row
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sang
it
until
the
other
children
heard
and
laughed
,
too
;
and
the
*NL*
crosser
Mary
got
,
the
more
they
sang
``
Mistress
Mary
,
quite
contrary
''
;
*NL*
and
after
that
as
long
as
she
stayed
with
them
they
called
her
*NL*
``
Mistress
Mary
Quite
Contrary
''
when
they
spoke
of
her
to
each
other
,
*NL*
and
often
when
they
spoke
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
to
be
sent
home
,
''
Basil
said
to
her
,
``
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
week
.
And
we
're
glad
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
it
,
too
,
''
answered
Mary
.
``
Where
is
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
know
where
home
is
!
''
said
Basil
,
with
seven-year-old
*NL*
scorn
.
``
It
's
England
,
of
course
.
Our
grandmama
lives
there
and
our
*NL*
sister
Mabel
was
sent
to
her
last
year
.
You
are
not
going
to
your
*NL*
grandmama
.
You
have
none
.
You
are
going
to
your
uncle
.
His
name
is
*NL*
Mr.
Archibald
Craven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
him
,
''
snapped
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
do
n't
,
''
Basil
answered
.
``
You
do
n't
know
anything
.
Girls
*NL*
never
do
.
I
heard
father
and
mother
talking
about
him
.
He
lives
in
a
*NL*
great
,
big
,
desolate
old
house
in
the
country
and
no
one
goes
near
him
.
*NL*
He
's
so
cross
he
wo
n't
let
them
,
and
they
would
n't
come
if
he
would
let
*NL*
them
.
He
's
a
hunchback
,
and
he
's
horrid
.
''
``
I
do
n't
believe
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Mary
;
and
she
turned
her
back
and
stuck
her
fingers
in
her
ears
,
*NL*
because
she
would
not
listen
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
thought
over
it
a
great
deal
afterward
;
and
when
Mrs.
Crawford
*NL*
told
her
that
night
that
she
was
going
to
sail
away
to
England
in
a
few
*NL*
days
and
go
to
her
uncle
,
Mr.
Archibald
Craven
,
who
lived
at
*NL*
Misselthwaite
Manor
,
she
looked
so
stony
and
stubbornly
uninterested
*NL*
that
they
did
not
know
what
to
think
about
her
.
They
tried
to
be
kind
*NL*
to
her
,
but
she
only
turned
her
face
away
when
Mrs.
Crawford
attempted
*NL*
to
kiss
her
,
and
held
herself
stiffly
when
Mr.
Crawford
patted
her
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
such
a
plain
child
,
''
Mrs.
Crawford
said
pityingly
,
afterward
.
*NL*
``
And
her
mother
was
such
a
pretty
creature
.
She
had
a
very
pretty
*NL*
manner
,
too
,
and
Mary
has
the
most
unattractive
ways
I
ever
saw
in
a
*NL*
child
.
The
children
call
her
`
Mistress
Mary
Quite
Contrary
,
'
and
*NL*
though
it
's
naughty
of
them
,
one
ca
n't
help
understanding
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
if
her
mother
had
carried
her
pretty
face
and
her
pretty
*NL*
manners
oftener
into
the
nursery
Mary
might
have
learned
some
pretty
*NL*
ways
too
.
It
is
very
sad
,
now
the
poor
beautiful
thing
is
gone
,
to
*NL*
remember
that
many
people
never
even
knew
that
she
had
a
child
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
she
scarcely
ever
looked
at
her
,
''
sighed
Mrs.
Crawford
.
*NL*
``
When
her
Ayah
was
dead
there
was
no
one
to
give
a
thought
to
the
*NL*
little
thing
.
Think
of
the
servants
running
away
and
leaving
her
all
*NL*
alone
in
that
deserted
bungalow
.
Colonel
McGrew
said
he
nearly
jumped
*NL*
out
of
his
skin
when
he
opened
the
door
and
found
her
standing
by
*NL*
herself
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
made
the
long
voyage
to
England
under
the
care
of
an
officer
's
*NL*
wife
,
who
was
taking
her
children
to
leave
them
in
a
boarding-school
.
*NL*
She
was
very
much
absorbed
in
her
own
little
boy
and
girl
,
and
was
*NL*
rather
glad
to
hand
the
child
over
to
the
woman
Mr.
Archibald
Craven
*NL*
sent
to
meet
her
,
in
London
.
The
woman
was
his
housekeeper
at
*NL*
Misselthwaite
Manor
,
and
her
name
was
Mrs.
Medlock
.
She
was
a
stout
*NL*
woman
,
with
very
red
cheeks
and
sharp
black
eyes
.
She
wore
a
very
*NL*
purple
dress
,
a
black
silk
mantle
with
jet
fringe
on
it
and
a
black
*NL*
bonnet
with
purple
velvet
flowers
which
stuck
up
and
trembled
when
she
*NL*
moved
her
head
.
Mary
did
not
like
her
at
all
,
but
as
she
very
seldom
*NL*
liked
people
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
that
;
besides
which
it
was
*NL*
very
evident
Mrs.
Medlock
did
not
think
much
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
!
she
's
a
plain
little
piece
of
goods
!
''
she
said
.
``
And
we
'd
*NL*
heard
that
her
mother
was
a
beauty
.
She
has
n't
handed
much
of
it
down
,
*NL*
has
she
,
ma'am
?
''
``
Perhaps
she
will
improve
as
she
grows
older
,
''
the
*NL*
officer
's
wife
said
good-naturedly
.
``
If
she
were
not
so
sallow
and
had
*NL*
a
nicer
expression
,
her
features
are
rather
good
.
Children
alter
so
*NL*
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
have
to
alter
a
good
deal
,
''
answered
Mrs.
Medlock
.
``
And
,
*NL*
there
's
nothing
likely
to
improve
children
at
Misselthwaite
--
if
you
ask
*NL*
me
!
''
They
thought
Mary
was
not
listening
because
she
was
standing
a
*NL*
little
apart
from
them
at
the
window
of
the
private
hotel
they
had
gone
*NL*
to
.
She
was
watching
the
passing
buses
and
cabs
and
people
,
but
she
*NL*
heard
quite
well
and
was
made
very
curious
about
her
uncle
and
the
*NL*
place
he
lived
in
.
What
sort
of
a
place
was
it
,
and
what
would
he
be
*NL*
like
?
What
was
a
hunchback
?
She
had
never
seen
one
.
Perhaps
there
*NL*
were
none
in
India
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
she
had
been
living
in
other
people
's
houses
and
had
had
no
Ayah
,
*NL*
she
had
begun
to
feel
lonely
and
to
think
queer
thoughts
which
were
new
*NL*
to
her
.
She
had
begun
to
wonder
why
she
had
never
seemed
to
belong
to
*NL*
anyone
even
when
her
father
and
mother
had
been
alive
.
Other
children
*NL*
seemed
to
belong
to
their
fathers
and
mothers
,
but
she
had
never
seemed
*NL*
to
really
be
anyone
's
little
girl
.
She
had
had
servants
,
and
food
and
*NL*
clothes
,
but
no
one
had
taken
any
notice
of
her
.
She
did
not
know
that
*NL*
this
was
because
she
was
a
disagreeable
child
;
but
then
,
of
course
,
she
*NL*
did
not
know
she
was
disagreeable
.
She
often
thought
that
other
people
*NL*
were
,
but
she
did
not
know
that
she
was
so
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
Mrs.
Medlock
the
most
disagreeable
person
she
had
ever
*NL*
seen
,
with
her
common
,
highly
colored
face
and
her
common
fine
bonnet
.
*NL*
When
the
next
day
they
set
out
on
their
journey
to
Yorkshire
,
she
*NL*
walked
through
the
station
to
the
railway
carriage
with
her
head
up
and
*NL*
trying
to
keep
as
far
away
from
her
as
she
could
,
because
she
did
not
*NL*
want
to
seem
to
belong
to
her
.
It
would
have
made
her
angry
to
think
*NL*
people
imagined
she
was
her
little
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Medlock
was
not
in
the
least
disturbed
by
her
and
her
*NL*
thoughts
.
She
was
the
kind
of
woman
who
would
``
stand
no
nonsense
from
*NL*
young
ones
.
''
At
least
,
that
is
what
she
would
have
said
if
she
had
been
*NL*
asked
.
She
had
not
wanted
to
go
to
London
just
when
her
sister
Maria
's
*NL*
daughter
was
going
to
be
married
,
but
she
had
a
comfortable
,
well
paid
*NL*
place
as
housekeeper
at
Misselthwaite
Manor
and
the
only
way
in
which
*NL*
she
could
keep
it
was
to
do
at
once
what
Mr.
Archibald
Craven
told
her
*NL*
to
do
.
She
never
dared
even
to
ask
a
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Lennox
and
his
wife
died
of
the
cholera
,
''
Mr.
Craven
had
said
*NL*
in
his
short
,
cold
way
.
``
Captain
Lennox
was
my
wife
's
brother
and
I
am
*NL*
their
daughter
's
guardian
.
The
child
is
to
be
brought
here
.
You
must
*NL*
go
to
London
and
bring
her
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
packed
her
small
trunk
and
made
the
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
sat
in
her
corner
of
the
railway
carriage
and
looked
plain
and
*NL*
fretful
.
She
had
nothing
to
read
or
to
look
at
,
and
she
had
folded
her
*NL*
thin
little
black-gloved
hands
in
her
lap
.
Her
black
dress
made
her
*NL*
look
yellower
than
ever
,
and
her
limp
light
hair
straggled
from
under
*NL*
her
black
crepe
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
more
marred-looking
young
one
I
never
saw
in
my
life
,
''
Mrs.
Medlock
*NL*
thought
.
-LRB-
Marred
is
a
Yorkshire
word
and
means
spoiled
and
pettish
.
-RRB-
*NL*
She
had
never
seen
a
child
who
sat
so
still
without
doing
anything
;
and
*NL*
at
last
she
got
tired
of
watching
her
and
began
to
talk
in
a
brisk
,
*NL*
hard
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
may
as
well
tell
you
something
about
where
you
are
going
*NL*
to
,
''
she
said
.
``
Do
you
know
anything
about
your
uncle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
heard
your
father
and
mother
talk
about
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Mary
frowning
.
She
frowned
because
she
remembered
that
her
*NL*
father
and
mother
had
never
talked
to
her
about
anything
in
particular
.
*NL*
Certainly
they
had
never
told
her
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph
,
''
muttered
Mrs.
Medlock
,
staring
at
her
queer
,
unresponsive
*NL*
little
face
.
She
did
not
say
any
more
for
a
few
moments
and
then
she
*NL*
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
might
as
well
be
told
something
--
to
prepare
you

You
*NL*
are
going
to
a
queer
place

*NL*
*NL*
Mary
said
nothing
at
all
,
and
Mrs.
Medlock
looked
rather
discomfited
by
*NL*
her
apparent
indifference
,
but
,
after
taking
a
breath
,
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
but
that
it
's
a
grand
big
place
in
a
gloomy
way
,
and
Mr.
Craven
's
*NL*
proud
of
it
in
his
way
--
and
that
's
gloomy
enough
,
too
.
The
house
is
*NL*
six
hundred
years
old
and
it
's
on
the
edge
of
the
moor
,
and
there
's
*NL*
near
a
hundred
rooms
in
it
,
though
most
of
them
's
shut
up
and
locked
.
*NL*
And
there
's
pictures
and
fine
old
furniture
and
things
that
's
been
*NL*
there
for
ages
,
and
there
's
a
big
park
round
it
and
gardens
and
trees
*NL*
with
branches
trailing
to
the
ground
--
some
of
them
.
''
She
paused
and
*NL*
took
another
breath
.
``
But
there
's
nothing
else
,
''
she
ended
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
begun
to
listen
in
spite
of
herself
.
It
all
sounded
so
unlike
*NL*
India
,
and
anything
new
rather
attracted
her
.
But
she
did
not
intend
*NL*
to
look
as
if
she
were
interested
.
That
was
one
of
her
unhappy
,
*NL*
disagreeable
ways
.
So
she
sat
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mrs.
Medlock
.
``
What
do
you
think
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
know
nothing
about
such
places
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
made
Mrs.
Medlock
laugh
a
short
sort
of
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
she
said
,
``
but
you
are
like
an
old
woman
.
Do
n't
you
care
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
matter
''
said
Mary
,
``
whether
I
care
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
enough
there
,
''
said
Mrs.
Medlock
.
``
It
does
n't
.
What
*NL*
you
're
to
be
kept
at
Misselthwaite
Manor
for
I
do
n't
know
,
unless
*NL*
because
it
's
the
easiest
way
.
He
's
not
going
to
trouble
himself
about
*NL*
you
,
that
's
sure
and
certain
.
He
never
troubles
himself
about
no
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
herself
as
if
she
had
just
remembered
something
in
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
got
a
crooked
back
,
''
she
said
.
``
That
set
him
wrong
.
He
was
a
*NL*
sour
young
man
and
got
no
good
of
all
his
money
and
big
place
till
he
*NL*
was
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
eyes
turned
toward
her
in
spite
of
her
intention
not
to
seem
to
*NL*
care
.
She
had
never
thought
of
the
hunchback
's
being
married
and
she
*NL*
was
a
trifle
surprised
.
Mrs.
Medlock
saw
this
,
and
as
she
was
a
*NL*
talkative
woman
she
continued
with
more
interest
.
This
was
one
way
of
*NL*
passing
some
of
the
time
,
at
any
rate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
a
sweet
,
pretty
thing
and
he
'd
have
walked
the
world
over
to
*NL*
get
her
a
blade
o
'
grass
she
wanted
.
Nobody
thought
she
'd
marry
him
,
*NL*
but
she
did
,
and
people
said
she
married
him
for
his
money
.
But
she
*NL*
did
n't
--
she
did
n't
,
''
positively
.
``
When
she
died
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
gave
a
little
involuntary
jump
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
did
she
die
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
quite
without
meaning
to
.
She
had
*NL*
just
remembered
a
French
fairy
story
she
had
once
read
called
``
Riquet
a
*NL*
la
Houppe
.
''
It
had
been
about
a
poor
hunchback
and
a
beautiful
princess
*NL*
and
it
had
made
her
suddenly
sorry
for
Mr.
Archibald
Craven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
died
,
''
Mrs.
Medlock
answered
.
``
And
it
made
him
queerer
than
*NL*
ever
.
He
cares
about
nobody
.
He
wo
n't
see
people
.
Most
of
the
time
*NL*
he
goes
away
,
and
when
he
is
at
Misselthwaite
he
shuts
himself
up
in
*NL*
the
West
Wing
and
wo
n't
let
any
one
but
Pitcher
see
him
.
Pitcher
's
an
*NL*
old
fellow
,
but
he
took
care
of
him
when
he
was
a
child
and
he
knows
*NL*
his
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
sounded
like
something
in
a
book
and
it
did
not
make
Mary
feel
*NL*
cheerful
.
A
house
with
a
hundred
rooms
,
nearly
all
shut
up
and
with
*NL*
their
doors
locked
--
a
house
on
the
edge
of
a
moor
--
whatsoever
a
moor
*NL*
was
--
sounded
dreary
.
A
man
with
a
crooked
back
who
shut
himself
up
*NL*
also
!
She
stared
out
of
the
window
with
her
lips
pinched
together
,
and
*NL*
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
the
rain
should
have
begun
to
pour
down
in
*NL*
gray
slanting
lines
and
splash
and
stream
down
the
window-panes
.
If
the
*NL*
pretty
wife
had
been
alive
she
might
have
made
things
cheerful
by
being
*NL*
something
like
her
own
mother
and
by
running
in
and
out
and
going
to
*NL*
parties
as
she
had
done
in
frocks
``
full
of
lace
.
''
But
she
was
not
there
*NL*
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
expect
to
see
him
,
because
ten
to
one
you
wo
n't
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Medlock
.
``
And
you
must
n't
expect
that
there
will
be
people
to
*NL*
talk
to
you
.
You
'll
have
to
play
about
and
look
after
yourself
.
*NL*
You
'll
be
told
what
rooms
you
can
go
into
and
what
rooms
you
're
to
keep
*NL*
out
of
.
There
's
gardens
enough
.
But
when
you
're
in
the
house
do
n't
go
*NL*
wandering
and
poking
about
.
Mr.
Craven
wo
n't
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
want
to
go
poking
about
,
''
said
sour
little
Mary
and
just
*NL*
as
suddenly
as
she
had
begun
to
be
rather
sorry
for
Mr.
Archibald
*NL*
Craven
she
began
to
cease
to
be
sorry
and
to
think
he
was
unpleasant
*NL*
enough
to
deserve
all
that
had
happened
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
turned
her
face
toward
the
streaming
panes
of
the
window
of
the
*NL*
railway
carriage
and
gazed
out
at
the
gray
rain-storm
which
looked
as
*NL*
if
it
would
go
on
forever
and
ever
.
She
watched
it
so
long
and
*NL*
steadily
that
the
grayness
grew
heavier
and
heavier
before
her
eyes
and
*NL*
she
fell
asleep
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
ACROSS
THE
MOOR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
slept
a
long
time
,
and
when
she
awakened
Mrs.
Medlock
had
bought
a
*NL*
lunchbasket
at
one
of
the
stations
and
they
had
some
chicken
and
cold
*NL*
beef
and
bread
and
butter
and
some
hot
tea
.
The
rain
seemed
to
be
*NL*
streaming
down
more
heavily
than
ever
and
everybody
in
the
station
wore
*NL*
wet
and
glistening
waterproofs
.
The
guard
lighted
the
lamps
in
the
*NL*
carriage
,
and
Mrs.
Medlock
cheered
up
very
much
over
her
tea
and
*NL*
chicken
and
beef
.
She
ate
a
great
deal
and
afterward
fell
asleep
*NL*
herself
,
and
Mary
sat
and
stared
at
her
and
watched
her
fine
bonnet
*NL*
slip
on
one
side
until
she
herself
fell
asleep
once
more
in
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
carriage
,
lulled
by
the
splashing
of
the
rain
against
the
*NL*
windows
.
It
was
quite
dark
when
she
awakened
again
.
The
train
had
*NL*
stopped
at
a
station
and
Mrs.
Medlock
was
shaking
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
had
a
sleep
!
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
time
to
open
your
eyes
!
We
're
*NL*
at
Thwaite
Station
and
we
've
got
a
long
drive
before
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
stood
up
and
tried
to
keep
her
eyes
open
while
Mrs.
Medlock
*NL*
collected
her
parcels
.
The
little
girl
did
not
offer
to
help
her
,
*NL*
because
in
India
native
servants
always
picked
up
or
carried
things
and
*NL*
it
seemed
quite
proper
that
other
people
should
wait
on
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
station
was
a
small
one
and
nobody
but
themselves
seemed
to
be
*NL*
getting
out
of
the
train
.
The
station-master
spoke
to
Mrs.
Medlock
in
*NL*
a
rough
,
good-natured
way
,
pronouncing
his
words
in
a
queer
broad
*NL*
fashion
which
Mary
found
out
afterward
was
Yorkshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
tha
's
got
back
,
''
he
said
.
``
An
'
tha
's
browt
th
'
young
`
un
with
*NL*
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
that
's
her
,
''
answered
Mrs.
Medlock
,
speaking
with
a
Yorkshire
*NL*
accent
herself
and
jerking
her
head
over
her
shoulder
toward
Mary
.
*NL*
``
How
's
thy
Missus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
enow
.
Th
'
carriage
is
waitin
'
outside
for
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
brougham
stood
on
the
road
before
the
little
outside
platform
.
Mary
*NL*
saw
that
it
was
a
smart
carriage
and
that
it
was
a
smart
footman
who
*NL*
helped
her
in
.
His
long
waterproof
coat
and
the
waterproof
covering
of
*NL*
his
hat
were
shining
and
dripping
with
rain
as
everything
was
,
the
*NL*
burly
station-master
included
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
shut
the
door
,
mounted
the
box
with
the
coachman
,
and
they
*NL*
drove
off
,
the
little
girl
found
herself
seated
in
a
comfortably
*NL*
cushioned
corner
,
but
she
was
not
inclined
to
go
to
sleep
again
.
She
*NL*
sat
and
looked
out
of
the
window
,
curious
to
see
something
of
the
road
*NL*
over
which
she
was
being
driven
to
the
queer
place
Mrs.
Medlock
had
*NL*
spoken
of
.
She
was
not
at
all
a
timid
child
and
she
was
not
exactly
*NL*
frightened
,
but
she
felt
that
there
was
no
knowing
what
might
happen
in
*NL*
a
house
with
a
hundred
rooms
nearly
all
shut
up
--
a
house
standing
on
*NL*
the
edge
of
a
moor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
a
moor
?
''
she
said
suddenly
to
Mrs.
Medlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out
of
the
window
in
about
ten
minutes
and
you
'll
see
,
''
the
woman
*NL*
answered
.
``
We
've
got
to
drive
five
miles
across
Missel
Moor
before
we
*NL*
get
to
the
Manor
.
You
wo
n't
see
much
because
it
's
a
dark
night
,
but
*NL*
you
can
see
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
asked
no
more
questions
but
waited
in
the
darkness
of
her
corner
,
*NL*
keeping
her
eyes
on
the
window
.
The
carriage
lamps
cast
rays
of
light
*NL*
a
little
distance
ahead
of
them
and
she
caught
glimpses
of
the
things
*NL*
they
passed
.
After
they
had
left
the
station
they
had
driven
through
a
*NL*
tiny
village
and
she
had
seen
whitewashed
cottages
and
the
lights
of
a
*NL*
public
house
.
Then
they
had
passed
a
church
and
a
vicarage
and
a
*NL*
little
shop-window
or
so
in
a
cottage
with
toys
and
sweets
and
odd
*NL*
things
set
out
for
sale
.
Then
they
were
on
the
highroad
and
she
saw
*NL*
hedges
and
trees
.
After
that
there
seemed
nothing
different
for
a
long
*NL*
time
--
or
at
least
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
horses
began
to
go
more
slowly
,
as
if
they
were
climbing
*NL*
up-hill
,
and
presently
there
seemed
to
be
no
more
hedges
and
no
more
*NL*
trees
.
She
could
see
nothing
,
in
fact
,
but
a
dense
darkness
on
either
*NL*
side
.
She
leaned
forward
and
pressed
her
face
against
the
window
just
*NL*
as
the
carriage
gave
a
big
jolt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
We
're
on
the
moor
now
sure
enough
,
''
said
Mrs.
Medlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
lamps
shed
a
yellow
light
on
a
rough-looking
road
which
*NL*
seemed
to
be
cut
through
bushes
and
low-growing
things
which
ended
in
*NL*
the
great
expanse
of
dark
apparently
spread
out
before
and
around
them
.
*NL*
A
wind
was
rising
and
making
a
singular
,
wild
,
low
,
rushing
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
--
it
's
not
the
sea
,
is
it
?
''
said
Mary
,
looking
round
at
her
*NL*
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
it
,
''
answered
Mrs.
Medlock
.
``
Nor
it
is
n't
fields
nor
*NL*
mountains
,
it
's
just
miles
and
miles
and
miles
of
wild
land
that
*NL*
nothing
grows
on
but
heather
and
gorse
and
broom
,
and
nothing
lives
on
*NL*
but
wild
ponies
and
sheep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
as
if
it
might
be
the
sea
,
if
there
were
water
on
it
,
''
said
*NL*
Mary
.
``
It
sounds
like
the
sea
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
wind
blowing
through
the
bushes
,
''
Mrs.
Medlock
said
.
``
It
's
*NL*
a
wild
,
dreary
enough
place
to
my
mind
,
though
there
's
plenty
that
*NL*
likes
it
--
particularly
when
the
heather
's
in
bloom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
and
on
they
drove
through
the
darkness
,
and
though
the
rain
stopped
,
*NL*
the
wind
rushed
by
and
whistled
and
made
strange
sounds
.
The
road
went
*NL*
up
and
down
,
and
several
times
the
carriage
passed
over
a
little
bridge
*NL*
beneath
which
water
rushed
very
fast
with
a
great
deal
of
noise
.
Mary
*NL*
felt
as
if
the
drive
would
never
come
to
an
end
and
that
the
wide
,
*NL*
bleak
moor
was
a
wide
expanse
of
black
ocean
through
which
she
was
*NL*
passing
on
a
strip
of
dry
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
it
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
I
do
n't
like
it
,
''
and
she
*NL*
pinched
her
thin
lips
more
tightly
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
were
climbing
up
a
hilly
piece
of
road
when
she
first
caught
*NL*
sight
of
a
light
.
Mrs.
Medlock
saw
it
as
soon
as
she
did
and
drew
a
*NL*
long
sigh
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
I
am
glad
to
see
that
bit
o
'
light
twinkling
,
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
``
It
's
the
light
in
the
lodge
window
.
We
shall
get
a
good
cup
of
tea
*NL*
after
a
bit
,
at
all
events
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
``
after
a
bit
,
''
as
she
said
,
for
when
the
carriage
passed
through
*NL*
the
park
gates
there
was
still
two
miles
of
avenue
to
drive
through
and
*NL*
the
trees
-LRB-
which
nearly
met
overhead
-RRB-
made
it
seem
as
if
they
were
*NL*
driving
through
a
long
dark
vault
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
out
of
the
vault
into
a
clear
space
and
stopped
before
an
*NL*
immensely
long
but
low-built
house
which
seemed
to
ramble
round
a
stone
*NL*
court
.
At
first
Mary
thought
that
there
were
no
lights
at
all
in
the
*NL*
windows
,
but
as
she
got
out
of
the
carriage
she
saw
that
one
room
in
a
*NL*
corner
upstairs
showed
a
dull
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance
door
was
a
huge
one
made
of
massive
,
curiously
shaped
*NL*
panels
of
oak
studded
with
big
iron
nails
and
bound
with
great
iron
*NL*
bars
.
It
opened
into
an
enormous
hall
,
which
was
so
dimly
lighted
that
*NL*
the
faces
in
the
portraits
on
the
walls
and
the
figures
in
the
suits
of
*NL*
armor
made
Mary
feel
that
she
did
not
want
to
look
at
them
.
As
she
*NL*
stood
on
the
stone
floor
she
looked
a
very
small
,
odd
little
black
*NL*
figure
,
and
she
felt
as
small
and
lost
and
odd
as
she
looked
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
neat
,
thin
old
man
stood
near
the
manservant
who
opened
the
door
for
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
to
take
her
to
her
room
,
''
he
said
in
a
husky
voice
.
``
He
*NL*
does
n't
want
to
see
her
.
He
's
going
to
London
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
Mr.
Pitcher
,
''
Mrs.
Medlock
answered
.
``
So
long
as
I
know
*NL*
what
's
expected
of
me
,
I
can
manage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
expected
of
you
,
Mrs.
Medlock
,
''
Mr.
Pitcher
said
,
``
is
that
you
*NL*
make
sure
that
he
's
not
disturbed
and
that
he
does
n't
see
what
he
*NL*
does
n't
want
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
Mary
Lennox
was
led
up
a
broad
staircase
and
down
a
long
*NL*
corridor
and
up
a
short
flight
of
steps
and
through
another
corridor
*NL*
and
another
,
until
a
door
opened
in
a
wall
and
she
found
herself
in
a
*NL*
room
with
a
fire
in
it
and
a
supper
on
a
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Medlock
said
unceremoniously
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
you
are
!
This
room
and
the
next
are
where
you
'll
live
--
and
*NL*
you
must
keep
to
them
.
Do
n't
you
forget
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
this
way
Mistress
Mary
arrived
at
Misselthwaite
Manor
and
she
*NL*
had
perhaps
never
felt
quite
so
contrary
in
all
her
life
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
MARTHA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
opened
her
eyes
in
the
morning
it
was
because
a
young
*NL*
housemaid
had
come
into
her
room
to
light
the
fire
and
was
kneeling
on
*NL*
the
hearth-rug
raking
out
the
cinders
noisily
.
Mary
lay
and
watched
*NL*
her
for
a
few
moments
and
then
began
to
look
about
the
room
.
She
had
*NL*
never
seen
a
room
at
all
like
it
and
thought
it
curious
and
gloomy
.
*NL*
The
walls
were
covered
with
tapestry
with
a
forest
scene
embroidered
on
*NL*
it
.
There
were
fantastically
dressed
people
under
the
trees
and
in
the
*NL*
distance
there
was
a
glimpse
of
the
turrets
of
a
castle
.
There
were
*NL*
hunters
and
horses
and
dogs
and
ladies
.
Mary
felt
as
if
she
were
in
*NL*
the
forest
with
them
.
Out
of
a
deep
window
she
could
see
a
great
*NL*
climbing
stretch
of
land
which
seemed
to
have
no
trees
on
it
,
and
to
*NL*
look
rather
like
an
endless
,
dull
,
purplish
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
she
said
,
pointing
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
,
the
young
housemaid
,
who
had
just
risen
to
her
feet
,
looked
and
*NL*
pointed
also
.
``
That
there
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
th
'
moor
,
''
with
a
good-natured
grin
.
``
Does
tha
'
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Mary
.
``
I
hate
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
because
tha
`
rt
not
used
to
it
,
''
Martha
said
,
going
back
to
her
*NL*
hearth
.
``
Tha
'
thinks
it
's
too
big
an
'
bare
now
.
But
tha
'
will
like
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
''
inquired
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
that
I
do
,
''
answered
Martha
,
cheerfully
polishing
away
at
the
*NL*
grate
.
``
I
just
love
it
.
It
's
none
bare
.
It
's
covered
wi
'
growin
'
*NL*
things
as
smells
sweet
.
It
's
fair
lovely
in
spring
an
'
summer
when
th
'
*NL*
gorse
an
'
broom
an
'
heather
's
in
flower
.
It
smells
o
'
honey
an
'
*NL*
there
's
such
a
lot
o
'
fresh
air
--
an
'
th
'
sky
looks
so
high
an
'
th
'
bees
*NL*
an
'
skylarks
makes
such
a
nice
noise
hummin
'
an
'
singin
'
.
Eh
!
I
*NL*
would
n't
live
away
from
th
'
moor
for
anythin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
listened
to
her
with
a
grave
,
puzzled
expression
.
The
native
*NL*
servants
she
had
been
used
to
in
India
were
not
in
the
least
like
this
.
*NL*
They
were
obsequious
and
servile
and
did
not
presume
to
talk
to
their
*NL*
masters
as
if
they
were
their
equals
.
They
made
salaams
and
called
*NL*
them
``
protector
of
the
poor
''
and
names
of
that
sort
.
Indian
servants
*NL*
were
commanded
to
do
things
,
not
asked
.
It
was
not
the
custom
to
say
*NL*
``
please
''
and
``
thank
you
''
and
Mary
had
always
slapped
her
Ayah
in
the
*NL*
face
when
she
was
angry
.
She
wondered
a
little
what
this
girl
would
do
*NL*
if
one
slapped
her
in
the
face
.
She
was
a
round
,
rosy
,
*NL*
good-natured-looking
creature
,
but
she
had
a
sturdy
way
which
made
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
wonder
if
she
might
not
even
slap
back
--
if
the
person
who
*NL*
slapped
her
was
only
a
little
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
strange
servant
,
''
she
said
from
her
pillows
,
rather
*NL*
haughtily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
sat
up
on
her
heels
,
with
her
blacking-brush
in
her
hand
,
and
*NL*
laughed
,
without
seeming
the
least
out
of
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
I
know
that
,
''
she
said
.
``
If
there
was
a
grand
Missus
at
*NL*
Misselthwaite
I
should
never
have
been
even
one
of
th
'
under
*NL*
house-maids
.
I
might
have
been
let
to
be
scullerymaid
but
I
'd
never
*NL*
have
been
let
upstairs
.
I
'm
too
common
an
'
I
talk
too
much
Yorkshire
.
*NL*
But
this
is
a
funny
house
for
all
it
's
so
grand
.
Seems
like
there
's
*NL*
neither
Master
nor
Mistress
except
Mr.
Pitcher
an
'
Mrs.
Medlock
.
Mr.
*NL*
Craven
,
he
wo

be
troubled
about
anythin

when

's
here
,
an

he
's
*NL*
nearly
always
away
.
Mrs.
Medlock
gave
me
th
'
place
out
o

kindness
.
*NL*
She
told
me
she
could
never
have
done
it

Misselthwaite
had
been
like
*NL*
other
big
houses

''
``
Are
you
going
to
be
my
servant
?
''
Mary
asked
,
still
*NL*
in
her
imperious
little
Indian
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
began
to
rub
her
grate
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
Mrs.
Medlock
's
servant
,
''
she
said
stoutly
.
``
An
'
she

Mr.
*NL*
Craven

but
I
'm
to

housemaid

But
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
going
to
dress
me
?
''
demanded
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
sat
up
on
her
heels
again
and
stared
.
She
spoke
in
broad
*NL*
Yorkshire
in
her
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Canna
'
tha
'
dress

!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
I
do
n't
understand
your
language
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
I
forgot
,
''
Martha
said
.
``
Mrs.
Medlock
told
me
I
'd
have
to
be
*NL*
careful
or
you
would
n't
know
what

sayin

.
I
mean
ca
n't
you
put
*NL*
on
your
own
clothes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Mary
,
quite
indignantly
.
``
I
never
did
in
my
life
.
My
*NL*
Ayah
dressed
me
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Martha
,
evidently
not
in
the
least
aware
that
she
was
*NL*
impudent
,
``
it
's
time
tha
'
should
learn
.
Tha
'
can
not
begin
younger

*NL*
It
'll
do
thee
good
to
wait

a
bit

My
mother
always
said
she
*NL*
could
n't
see
why
grand
people
's
children
did
n't
turn
out
fair
*NL*
fools
--
what
with
nurses
an
'
bein
'
washed
an

dressed

took
out
to
*NL*
walk
as
if
they
was
puppies

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
different
in
India

''
said
Mistress
Mary
disdainfully
.
She
could
*NL*
scarcely
stand
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Martha
was
not
at
all
crushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
I
can
see
it
's
different
,
''
she
answered
almost
sympathetically
.
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
it
's
because
there
's
such
a
lot
o

blacks
there
instead
o

*NL*
respectable
white
people

When
I
heard
you
was
comin

from
India
I
*NL*
thought
you
was
a
black
too

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
sat
up
in
bed
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
she
said
.
``
What
!
You
thought
I
was
a
native
.
You
--
you
*NL*
daughter
of
a
pig

*NL*
*NL*
Martha
stared
and
looked
hot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
callin
'
names

''
she
said
.
``
You
need
n't
be
so
vexed

*NL*
That
's
not
th

way
for
a
young

I
've
nothin

against
th

*NL*
blacks

When
you
read
about

they

always
very

religious

You

to

your
fire
this
mornin

I
crep

up

careful
to

disappointedly

*NL*
Mary
did
not
even
try
to
control
her
rage
and
humiliation
.
``
You
*NL*

You

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
such
a
rage
and
felt
so
helpless
before
the
girl
's
simple
*NL*
stare
,
and
somehow
she
suddenly
felt
so
horribly
lonely
and
far
away
*NL*
from
everything
she
understood
and
which
understood
her
,
that
she
threw
*NL*
herself
face
downward
on
the
pillows
and
burst
into
passionate
sobbing
.
*NL*
She
sobbed
so
unrestrainedly
that
good-natured
Yorkshire
Martha
was
a
*NL*
little
frightened
and
quite
sorry
for
her
.
She
went
to
the
bed
and
*NL*
bent
over
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
you
must
n't
cry
like

there

she
begged
.
``
You

your
pardon

Do

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
comforting
and
really
friendly
in
her
queer
*NL*
Yorkshire
speech
and
sturdy
way
which
had
a
good
effect
on
Mary
.
She
*NL*
gradually
ceased
crying
and
became
quiet
.
Martha
looked
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
time
for
thee
to
get
up
now

she
said

When
Mary
at

decided
to
get
up

the
clothes
Martha
took
from
the
*NL*
wardrobe
were
not
the
ones

arrived
the
night

before
with
Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``

looked

cool
approval

always
knows
what
a
body
means
.
*NL*
She
does
n't
hold
with
black
hersel
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
black
things
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dressing
process
was
one
which
taught
them
both
something
.
Martha
*NL*
had
``
buttoned
up
''
her
little
sisters
and
brothers
but
she
had
never
*NL*
seen
a
child
who
stood
still
and
waited
for
another
person
to
do
things
*NL*
for
her
as
if
she
had
neither
hands
nor
feet
of
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
n't
tha
'
put
on
tha
'
own
shoes
?
''
she
said
when
Mary
quietly
*NL*
held
out
her
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Ayah
did
it
,
''
answered
Mary
,
staring
.
``
It
was
the
custom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
that
very
often
--
``
It
was
the
custom
.
''
The
native
servants
were
*NL*
always
saying
it
.
If
one
told
them
to
do
a
thing
their
ancestors
had
*NL*
not
done
for
a
thousand
years
they
gazed
at
one
mildly
and
said
,
``
It
is
*NL*
not
the
custom
''
and
one
knew
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
not
been
the
custom
that
Mistress
Mary
should
do
anything
but
*NL*
stand
and
allow
herself
to
be
dressed
like
a
doll
,
but
before
she
was
*NL*
ready
for
breakfast
she
began
to
suspect
that
her
life
at
Misselthwaite
*NL*
Manor
would
end
by
teaching
her
a
number
of
things
quite
new
to
*NL*
her
--
things
such
as
putting
on
her
own
shoes
and
stockings
,
and
picking
*NL*
up
things
she
let
fall
.
If
Martha
had
been
a
well-trained
fine
young
*NL*
lady
's
maid
she
would
have
been
more
subservient
and
respectful
and
*NL*
would
have
known
that
it
was
her
business
to
brush
hair
,
and
button
*NL*
boots
,
and
pick
things
up
and
lay
them
away
.
She
was
,
however
,
only
an
*NL*
untrained
Yorkshire
rustic
who
had
been
brought
up
in
a
moorland
*NL*
cottage
with
a
swarm
of
little
brothers
and
sisters
who
had
never
*NL*
dreamed
of
doing
anything
but
waiting
on
themselves
and
on
the
younger
*NL*
ones
who
were
either
babies
in
arms
or
just
learning
to
totter
about
*NL*
and
tumble
over
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Mary
Lennox
had
been
a
child
who
was
ready
to
be
amused
she
would
*NL*
perhaps
have
laughed
at
Martha
's
readiness
to
talk
,
but
Mary
only
*NL*
listened
to
her
coldly
and
wondered
at
her
freedom
of
manner
.
At
first
*NL*
she
was
not
at
all
interested
,
but
gradually
,
as
the
girl
rattled
on
in
*NL*
her
good-tempered
,
homely
way
,
Mary
began
to
notice
what
she
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
you
should
see
'em
all
,
''
she
said
.
``
There
's
twelve
of
us
an
'
my
*NL*
father
only
gets
sixteen
shilling
a
week
.
I
can
tell
you
my
mother
's
*NL*
put
to
it
to
get
porridge
for
'em
all
.
They
tumble
about
on
th
'
moor
*NL*
an
'
play
there
all
day
an
'
mother
says
th
'
air
of
th
'
moor
fattens
'em
.
*NL*
She
says
she
believes
they
eat
th
'
grass
same
as
th
'
wild
ponies
do
.
*NL*
Our
Dickon
,
he
's
twelve
years
old
and
he
's
got
a
young
pony
he
calls
*NL*
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
he
get
it
?
''
asked
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
found
it
on
th
'
moor
with
its
mother
when
it
was
a
little
one
an
'
*NL*
he
began
to
make
friends
with
it
an
'
give
it
bits
o
'
bread
an
'
pluck
*NL*
young
grass
for
it
.
And
it
got
to
like
him
so
it
follows
him
about
an
'
*NL*
it
lets
him
get
on
its
back
.
Dickon
's
a
kind
lad
an
'
animals
likes
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
never
possessed
an
animal
pet
of
her
own
and
had
always
*NL*
thought
she
should
like
one
.
So
she
began
to
feel
a
slight
interest
in
*NL*
Dickon
,
and
as
she
had
never
before
been
interested
in
any
one
but
*NL*
herself
,
it
was
the
dawning
of
a
healthy
sentiment
.
When
she
went
into
*NL*
the
room
which
had
been
made
into
a
nursery
for
her
,
she
found
that
it
*NL*
was
rather
like
the
one
she
had
slept
in
.
It
was
not
a
child
's
room
,
*NL*
but
a
grown-up
person
's
room
,
with
gloomy
old
pictures
on
the
walls
and
*NL*
heavy
old
oak
chairs
.
A
table
in
the
center
was
set
with
a
good
*NL*
substantial
breakfast
.
But
she
had
always
had
a
very
small
appetite
,
*NL*
and
she
looked
with
something
more
than
indifference
at
the
first
plate
*NL*
Martha
set
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
it
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
does
n't
want
thy
porridge
!
''
Martha
exclaimed
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
does
n't
know
how
good
it
is
.
Put
a
bit
o
'
treacle
on
it
or
a
bit
*NL*
o
'
sugar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
it
,
''
repeated
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
said
Martha
.
``
I
ca
n't
abide
to
see
good
victuals
go
to
waste
.
*NL*
If
our
children
was
at
this
table
they
'd
clean
it
bare
in
five
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
said
Mary
coldly
.
``
Why
!
''
echoed
Martha
.
``
Because
they
scarce
*NL*
ever
had
their
stomachs
full
in
their
lives
.
They
're
as
hungry
as
*NL*
young
hawks
an
'
foxes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
be
hungry
,
''
said
Mary
,
with
the
*NL*
indifference
of
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
looked
indignant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
would
do
thee
good
to
try
it
.
I
can
see
that
plain
enough
,
''
*NL*
she
said
outspokenly
.
``
I
've
no
patience
with
folk
as
sits
an
'
just
*NL*
stares
at
good
bread
an

meat
.
My
word
!
do
n't
I
wish
Dickon
and
Phil
*NL*
an
'
Jane
an
'
th

rest

what
's
here
under
their
pinafores
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
take
it
to
them
?
''
suggested
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
mine
,
''
answered
Martha
stoutly
.
``
An
'
this
is
n't
my
day
out
.
*NL*
I
get
my
day
out
once
a
month
same
as
th
'
rest
.
Then
I
go
home
an
'
*NL*
clean
up
for
mother
an
'
give
her
a
day
's
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
drank
some
tea
and
ate
a
little
toast
and
some
marmalade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wrap
up
warm
an
'
run
out
an
'
play
you
,
''
said
Martha
.
``
It
'll
do
*NL*
you
good
and
give
you
some
stomach
for
your
meat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
went
to
the
window
.
There
were
gardens
and
paths
and
big
trees
,
*NL*
but
everything
looked
dull
and
wintry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
?
Why
should
I
go
out
on
a
day
like
this
?
''
``
Well
,
if
tha
'
does
n't
*NL*
go
out
tha
`
lt
have
to
stay
in
,
an
'
what
has
tha
'
got
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
glanced
about
her
.
There
was
nothing
to
do
.
When
Mrs.
Medlock
*NL*
had
prepared
the
nursery
she
had
not
thought
of
amusement
.
Perhaps
it
*NL*
would
be
better
to
go
and
see
what
the
gardens
were
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
will
go
with
me
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
stared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
go
by
yourself
,
''
she
answered
.
``
You
'll
have
to
learn
to
play
*NL*
like
other
children
does
when
they
have
n't
got
sisters
and
brothers
.
*NL*
Our
Dickon
goes
off
on
th
'
moor
by
himself
an
'
plays
for
hours
.
That
's
*NL*
how
he
made
friends
with
th
'
pony
.
He
's
got
sheep
on
th
'
moor
that
*NL*
knows
him
,
an
'
birds
as
comes
an
'
eats
out
of
his
hand
.
However
little
*NL*
there
is
to
eat
,
he
always
saves
a
bit
o
'
his
bread
to
coax
his
pets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
really
this
mention
of
Dickon
which
made
Mary
decide
to
go
out
,
*NL*
though
she
was
not
aware
of
it
.
There
would
be
,
birds
outside
though
*NL*
there
would
not
be
ponies
or
sheep
.
They
would
be
different
from
the
*NL*
birds
in
India
and
it
might
amuse
her
to
look
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
found
her
coat
and
hat
for
her
and
a
pair
of
stout
little
boots
*NL*
and
she
showed
her
her
way
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
tha
'
goes
round
that
way
tha
'll
come
to
th
'
gardens
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
pointing
to
a
gate
in
a
wall
of
shrubbery
.
``
There
's
lots
o
'
flowers
in
*NL*
summer-time
,
but
there
's
nothin
'
bloomin
'
now
.
''
She
seemed
to
hesitate
*NL*
a
second
before
she
added
,
``
One
of
th
'
gardens
is
locked
up
.
No
one
*NL*
has
been
in
it
for
ten
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
asked
Mary
in
spite
of
herself
.
Here
was
another
locked
door
*NL*
added
to
the
hundred
in
the
strange
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Craven
had
it
shut
when
his
wife
died
so
sudden
.
He
wo
n't
let
no
*NL*
one
go
inside
.
It
was
her
garden
.
He
locked
th
'
door
an
'
dug
a
hole
*NL*
and
buried
th
'
key
.
There
's
Mrs.
Medlock
's
bell
ringing
--
I
must
run
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
she
was
gone
Mary
turned
down
the
walk
which
led
to
the
door
in
*NL*
the
shrubbery
.
She
could
not
help
thinking
about
the
garden
which
no
*NL*
one
had
been
into
for
ten
years
.
She
wondered
what
it
would
look
like
*NL*
and
whether
there
were
any
flowers
still
alive
in
it
.
When
she
had
*NL*
passed
through
the
shrubbery
gate
she
found
herself
in
great
gardens
,
*NL*
with
wide
lawns
and
winding
walks
with
clipped
borders
.
There
were
*NL*
trees
,
and
flower-beds
,
and
evergreens
clipped
into
strange
shapes
,
and
*NL*
a
large
pool
with
an
old
gray
fountain
in
its
midst
.
But
the
*NL*
flower-beds
were
bare
and
wintry
and
the
fountain
was
not
playing
.
*NL*
This
was
not
the
garden
which
was
shut
up
.
How
could
a
garden
be
shut
*NL*
up
?
You
could
always
walk
into
a
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
just
thinking
this
when
she
saw
that
,
at
the
end
of
the
path
*NL*
she
was
following
,
there
seemed
to
be
a
long
wall
,
with
ivy
growing
*NL*
over
it
.
She
was
not
familiar
enough
with
England
to
know
that
she
was
*NL*
coming
upon
the
kitchen-gardens
where
the
vegetables
and
fruit
were
*NL*
growing
.
She
went
toward
the
wall
and
found
that
there
was
a
green
*NL*
door
in
the
ivy
,
and
that
it
stood
open
.
This
was
not
the
closed
*NL*
garden
,
evidently
,
and
she
could
go
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
through
the
door
and
found
that
it
was
a
garden
with
walls
all
*NL*
round
it
and
that
it
was
only
one
of
several
walled
gardens
which
*NL*
seemed
to
open
into
one
another
.
She
saw
another
open
green
door
,
*NL*
revealing
bushes
and
pathways
between
beds
containing
winter
*NL*
vegetables
.
Fruit-trees
were
trained
flat
against
the
wall
,
and
over
*NL*
some
of
the
beds
there
were
glass
frames
.
The
place
was
bare
and
ugly
*NL*
enough
,
Mary
thought
,
as
she
stood
and
stared
about
her
.
It
might
be
*NL*
nicer
in
summer
when
things
were
green
,
but
there
was
nothing
pretty
*NL*
about
it
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
an
old
man
with
a
spade
over
his
shoulder
walked
through
the
*NL*
door
leading
from
the
second
garden
.
He
looked
startled
when
he
saw
*NL*
Mary
,
and
then
touched
his
cap
.
He
had
a
surly
old
face
,
and
did
not
*NL*
seem
at
all
pleased
to
see
her
--
but
then
she
was
displeased
with
his
*NL*
garden
and
wore
her
``
quite
contrary
''
expression
,
and
certainly
did
not
*NL*
seem
at
all
pleased
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
place
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
o
'
th
'
kitchen-gardens
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
said
Mary
,
pointing
through
the
other
green
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
of
'em
,
''
shortly
.
``
There
's
another
on
t
`
other
side
o
'
th
'
*NL*
wall
an
'
there
's
th
'
orchard
t
`
other
side
o
'
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
go
in
them
?
''
asked
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
tha
'
likes
.
But
there
's
nowt
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
made
no
response
.
She
went
down
the
path
and
through
the
second
*NL*
green
door
.
There
,
she
found
more
walls
and
winter
vegetables
and
*NL*
glass
frames
,
but
in
the
second
wall
there
was
another
green
door
and
*NL*
it
was
not
open
.
Perhaps
it
led
into
the
garden
which
no
one
had
seen
*NL*
for
ten
years
.
As
she
was
not
at
all
a
timid
child
and
always
did
what
*NL*
she
wanted
to
do
,
Mary
went
to
the
green
door
and
turned
the
handle
.
*NL*
She
hoped
the
door
would
not
open
because
she
wanted
to
be
sure
she
had
*NL*
found
the
mysterious
garden
--
but
it
did
open
quite
easily
and
she
*NL*
walked
through
it
and
found
herself
in
an
orchard
.
There
were
walls
*NL*
all
round
it
also
and
trees
trained
against
them
,
and
there
were
bare
*NL*
fruit-trees
growing
in
the
winter-browned
grass
--
but
there
was
no
green
*NL*
door
to
be
seen
anywhere
.
Mary
looked
for
it
,
and
yet
when
she
had
*NL*
entered
the
upper
end
of
the
garden
she
had
noticed
that
the
wall
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
end
with
the
orchard
but
to
extend
beyond
it
as
if
it
*NL*
enclosed
a
place
at
the
other
side
.
She
could
see
the
tops
of
trees
*NL*
above
the
wall
,
and
when
she
stood
still
she
saw
a
bird
with
a
bright
*NL*
red
breast
sitting
on
the
topmost
branch
of
one
of
them
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
he
burst
into
his
winter
song
--
almost
as
if
he
had
caught
sight
of
her
*NL*
and
was
calling
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
and
listened
to
him
and
somehow
his
cheerful
,
friendly
*NL*
little
whistle
gave
her
a
pleased
feeling
--
even
a
disagreeable
little
*NL*
girl
may
be
lonely
,
and
the
big
closed
house
and
big
bare
moor
and
big
*NL*
bare
gardens
had
made
this
one
feel
as
if
there
was
no
one
left
in
the
*NL*
world
but
herself
.
If
she
had
been
an
affectionate
child
,
who
had
been
*NL*
used
to
being
loved
,
she
would
have
broken
her
heart
,
but
even
though
*NL*
she
was
``
Mistress
Mary
Quite
Contrary
''
she
was
desolate
,
and
the
*NL*
bright-breasted
little
bird
brought
a
look
into
her
sour
little
face
*NL*
which
was
almost
a
smile
.
She
listened
to
him
until
he
flew
away
.
He
*NL*
was
not
like
an
Indian
bird
and
she
liked
him
and
wondered
if
she
*NL*
should
ever
see
him
again
.
Perhaps
he
lived
in
the
mysterious
garden
*NL*
and
knew
all
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
because
she
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
that
she
thought
*NL*
so
much
of
the
deserted
garden
.
She
was
curious
about
it
and
wanted
to
*NL*
see
what
it
was
like
.
Why
had
Mr.
Archibald
Craven
buried
the
key
?
If
*NL*
he
had
liked
his
wife
so
much
why
did
he
hate
her
garden
?
She
wondered
*NL*
if
she
should
ever
see
him
,
but
she
knew
that
if
she
did
she
should
not
*NL*
like
him
,
and
he
would
not
like
her
,
and
that
she
should
only
stand
and
*NL*
stare
at
him
and
say
nothing
,
though
she
should
be
wanting
dreadfully
*NL*
to
ask
him
why
he
had
done
such
a
queer
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
never
like
me
and
I
never
like
people
,
''
she
thought
.
``
And
I
*NL*
never
can
talk
as
the
Crawford
children
could
.
They
were
always
*NL*
talking
and
laughing
and
making
noises
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
of
the
robin
and
of
the
way
he
seemed
to
sing
his
song
at
*NL*
her
,
and
as
she
remembered
the
tree-top
he
perched
on
she
stopped
*NL*
rather
suddenly
on
the
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
that
tree
was
in
the
secret
garden
--
I
feel
sure
it
was
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
There
was
a
wall
round
the
place
and
there
was
no
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
back
into
the
first
kitchen-garden
she
had
entered
and
found
*NL*
the
old
man
digging
there
.
She
went
and
stood
beside
him
and
watched
*NL*
him
a
few
moments
in
her
cold
little
way
.
He
took
no
notice
of
her
and
*NL*
so
at
last
she
spoke
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
into
the
other
gardens
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
nothin
'
to
prevent
thee
,
''
he
answered
crustily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
into
the
orchard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
no
dog
at
th
'
door
to
bite
thee
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
no
door
there
into
the
other
garden
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
garden
?
''
he
said
in
a
rough
voice
,
stopping
his
digging
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
,
''
answered
Mistress
Mary
.
*NL*
``
There
are
trees
there
--
I
saw
the
tops
of
them
.
A
bird
with
a
red
*NL*
breast
was
sitting
on
one
of
them
and
he
sang
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
her
surprise
the
surly
old
weather-beaten
face
actually
changed
its
*NL*
expression
.
A
slow
smile
spread
over
it
and
the
gardener
looked
quite
*NL*
different
.
It
made
her
think
that
it
was
curious
how
much
nicer
a
*NL*
person
looked
when
he
smiled
.
She
had
not
thought
of
it
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
about
to
the
orchard
side
of
his
garden
and
began
to
*NL*
whistle
--
a
low
soft
whistle
.
She
could
not
understand
how
such
a
surly
*NL*
man
could
make
such
a
coaxing
sound
.
Almost
the
next
moment
a
*NL*
wonderful
thing
happened
.
She
heard
a
soft
little
rushing
flight
*NL*
through
the
air
--
and
it
was
the
bird
with
the
red
breast
flying
to
*NL*
them
,
and
he
actually
alighted
on
the
big
clod
of
earth
quite
near
to
*NL*
the
gardener
's
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
,
''
chuckled
the
old
man
,
and
then
he
spoke
to
the
bird
as
if
*NL*
he
were
speaking
to
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
has
tha
'
been
,
tha
'
cheeky
little
beggar
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
've
not
*NL*
seen
thee
before
today
.
Has
tha
,
begun
tha
'
courtin
'
this
early
in
th
'
*NL*
season
?
Tha
`
rt
too
forrad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bird
put
his
tiny
head
on
one
side
and
looked
up
at
him
with
his
*NL*
soft
bright
eye
which
was
like
a
black
dewdrop
.
He
seemed
quite
*NL*
familiar
and
not
the
least
afraid
.
He
hopped
about
and
pecked
the
*NL*
earth
briskly
,
looking
for
seeds
and
insects
.
It
actually
gave
Mary
a
*NL*
queer
feeling
in
her
heart
,
because
he
was
so
pretty
and
cheerful
and
*NL*
seemed
so
like
a
person
.
He
had
a
tiny
plump
body
and
a
delicate
beak
,
*NL*
and
slender
delicate
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
he
always
come
when
you
call
him
?
''
she
asked
almost
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
that
he
will
.
I
've
knowed
him
ever
since
he
was
a
fledgling
.
He
*NL*
come
out
of
th
'
nest
in
th
'
other
garden
an
'
when
first
he
flew
over
*NL*
th
'
wall
he
was
too
weak
to
fly
back
for
a
few
days
an
'
we
got
*NL*
friendly
.
When
he
went
over
th
'
wall
again
th
'
rest
of
th
'
brood
was
*NL*
gone
an
'
he
was
lonely
an
'
he
come
back
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
kind
of
a
bird
is
he
?
''
Mary
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
tha
'
know
?
He
's
a
robin
redbreast
an
'
they
're
th

friendliest

*NL*
curiousest
birds
alive
.
They
're
almost
as
friendly
as
dogs

if
you
*NL*
know
how
to
get
on
with
'em
.
Watch
him
peckin
'
about
there
an
'
lookin
'
*NL*
round
at
us
now
an
'
again
.
He
knows
we
're
talkin
'
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
queerest
thing
in
the
world
to
see
the
old
fellow
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
the
plump
little
scarlet-waistcoated
bird
as
if
he
were
both
*NL*
proud
and
fond
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
conceited
one
,
''
he
chuckled
.
``
He
likes
to
hear
folk
talk
about
*NL*
him

An
'
curious
--
bless
me
,
there
never
was
his
like
for

to

all
th

*NL*
things
Mester
Craven
never
troubles
hissel
'
to
find
out
.
He
's
th
'
head
*NL*
gardener
,
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
robin
hopped
about
busily
pecking
the
soil
and
now
and
then
stopped
*NL*
and
looked
at
them
a
little
.
Mary
thought
his
black
dewdrop
eyes
gazed
*NL*
at
her
with
great
curiosity
.
It
really
seemed
as
if
he
were
finding
*NL*
out
all
about
her
.
The
queer
feeling
in
her
heart
increased
.
``
Where
*NL*
did
the
rest
of
the
brood
fly
to
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
knowin
'
.
The
old
ones
turn
'em
out
o
'
their
nest
an
'
make
*NL*
'em
fly
an
'
they
're
scattered
before
you
know
it
.
This
one
was
a
*NL*
knowin
'
one
an
'
he
knew
he
was
lonely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
went
a
step
nearer
to
the
robin
and
looked
at
him
very
*NL*
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
lonely
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
known
before
that
this
was
one
of
the
things
which
made
her
*NL*
feel
sour
and
cross
.
She
seemed
to
find
it
out
when
the
robin
looked
*NL*
at
her
and
she
looked
at
the
robin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gardener
pushed
his
cap
back
on
his
bald
head
and
stared
at
her
*NL*
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Art
tha
'
th
'
little
wench
from
India
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
no
wonder
tha
`
rt
lonely
.
Tha
`
lt
be
lonlier
before
tha
's
done
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
dig
again
,
driving
his
spade
deep
into
the
rich
black
*NL*
garden
soil
while
the
robin
hopped
about
very
busily
employed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
Mary
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
up
to
answer
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ben
Weatherstaff
,
''
he
answered
,
and
then
he
added
with
a
surly
*NL*
chuckle
,
``
I
'm
lonely
mysel
'
except
when
he
's
with
me
,
''
and
he
jerked
*NL*
his
thumb
toward
the
robin
.
``
He
's
th
'
only
friend
I
've
got
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
friends
at
all
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
never
had
.
My
Ayah
did
n't
*NL*
like
me
and
I
never
played
with
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
Yorkshire
habit
to
say
what
you
think
with
blunt
frankness
,
and
*NL*
old
Ben
Weatherstaff
was
a
Yorkshire
moor
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
an
'
me
are
a
good
bit
alike
,
''
he
said
.
``
We
was
wove
out
of
th
'
*NL*
same
cloth
.
We
're
neither
of
us
good
lookin
'
an
'
we
're
both
of
us
as
*NL*
sour
as
we
look
.
We
've
got
the
same
nasty
tempers
,
both
of
us
,
I
'll
*NL*
warrant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
plain
speaking
,
and
Mary
Lennox
had
never
heard
the
truth
*NL*
about
herself
in
her
life
.
Native
servants
always
salaamed
and
*NL*
submitted
to
you
,
whatever
you
did
.
She
had
never
thought
much
about
*NL*
her
looks
,
but
she
wondered
if
she
was
as
unattractive
as
Ben
*NL*
Weatherstaff
and
she
also
wondered
if
she
looked
as
sour
as
he
had
*NL*
looked
before
the
robin
came
.
She
actually
began
to
wonder
also
if
she
*NL*
was
``
nasty
tempered
.
''
She
felt
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
clear
rippling
little
sound
broke
out
near
her
and
she
*NL*
turned
round
.
She
was
standing
a
few
feet
from
a
young
apple-tree
and
*NL*
the
robin
had
flown
on
to
one
of
its
branches
and
had
burst
out
into
a
*NL*
scrap
of
a
song
.
Ben
Weatherstaff
laughed
outright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
do
that
for
?
''
asked
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
made
up
his
mind
to
make
friends
with
thee
,
''
replied
Ben
.
``
Dang
*NL*
me
if
he
has
n't
took
a
fancy
to
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
me
?
''
said
Mary
,
and
she
moved
toward
the
little
tree
softly
and
*NL*
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
make
friends
with
me
?
''
she
said
to
the
robin
just
as
if
she
*NL*
was
speaking
to
a
person
.
``
Would
you
?
''
And
she
did
not
say
it
either
*NL*
in
her
hard
little
voice
or
in
her
imperious
Indian
voice
,
but
in
a
*NL*
tone
so
soft
and
eager
and
coaxing
that
Ben
Weatherstaff
was
as
*NL*
surprised
as
she
had
been
when
she
heard
him
whistle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
he
cried
out
,
``
tha
'
said
that
as
nice
an
'
human
as
if
tha
'
was
a
*NL*
real
child
instead
of
a
sharp
old
woman
.
Tha
'
said
it
almost
like
*NL*
Dickon
talks
to
his
wild
things
on
th
'
moor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
Dickon
?
''
Mary
asked
,
turning
round
rather
in
a
hurry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
knows
him
.
Dickon
's
wanderin
'
about
everywhere
.
Th

very
*NL*
blackberries
an

heather-bells
knows
him

I
warrant
th

foxes
shows
*NL*
him
where
their

lies
an

th

skylarks
does
n't
hide
their
nests
*NL*
from
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
would
have
liked
to
ask
some
more
questions
.
She
was
almost
as
*NL*
curious
about
Dickon
as
she
was
about
the
deserted
garden
.
But
just
*NL*
that
moment
the
robin
,
who
had
ended
his
song
,
gave
a
little
shake
of
*NL*
his
wings
,
spread
them
and
flew
away
.
He
had
made
his
visit
and
had
*NL*
other
things
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
flown
over
the
wall
!
''
Mary
cried
out
,
watching
him
.
``
He
has
*NL*
flown
into
the
orchard
--
he
has
flown
across
the
other
wall

into
the
*NL*
garden
where
there
is
no
door
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
lives
there
,
''
said
old
Ben
.
``
He
came
out
o

th

egg
there

If

,
he
's
makin

up
to
some
young
madam
of
a
robin
that
lives
*NL*
among
th

old
rose-trees
there

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rose-trees
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
Are
there
rose-trees
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
took
up
his
spade
again
and
began
to
dig
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
ten
year
'
ago
,
''
he
mumbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to

said
Mary
.
``
Where
is
the
green
door
?
*NL*
There
must
be
a
door
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
drove
his
spade
deep
and
looked
as
uncompanionable
as
he
had
looked
*NL*
when
she
first
saw
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
ten
year
'
ago
,
but
there
is
n't
now
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
door
!
''
cried
Mary
.
``
There
must
be
.
''
``
None
as
any
one
can
find
,
an
'
*NL*
none
as
is
any
one
's
business

Do
n't
you
be
a
meddlesome
wench
an

*NL*
poke
your
nose
where
it
's
no
cause
to
go

Here
,
I
must
go
on
with
my
*NL*
work

Get
you
gone
an
'
play
you
.
I
've
no
more
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
actually
stopped
digging
,
threw
his
spade
over
his
shoulder
and
*NL*
walked
off
,
without
even
glancing
at
her
or
saying
good-by
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
THE
CRY
IN
THE
CORRIDOR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
each
day
which
passed
by
for
Mary
Lennox
was
exactly
like
the
*NL*
others
.
Every
morning
she
awoke
in
her
tapestried
room
and
found
*NL*
Martha
kneeling
upon
the
hearth
building
her
fire
;
every
morning
she
*NL*
ate
her
breakfast
in
the
nursery
which
had
nothing
amusing
in
it
;
and
*NL*
after
each
breakfast
she
gazed
out
of
the
window
across
to
the
huge
*NL*
moor
which
seemed
to
spread
out
on
all
sides
and
climb
up
to
the
sky
,
*NL*
and
after
she
had
stared
for
a
while
she
realized
that
if
she
did
not
*NL*
go
out
she
would
have
to
stay
in
and
do
nothing
--
and
so
she
went
out
.
*NL*
She
did
not
know
that
this
was
the
best
thing
she
could
have
done
,
and
*NL*
she
did
not
know
that
,
when
she
began
to
walk
quickly
or
even
run
along
*NL*
the
paths
and
down
the
avenue
,
she
was
stirring
her
slow
blood
and
*NL*
making
herself
stronger
by
fighting
with
the
wind
which
swept
down
from
*NL*
the
moor
.
She
ran
only
to
make
herself
warm
,
and
she
hated
the
wind
*NL*
which
rushed
at
her
face
and
roared
and
held
her
back
as
if
it
were
*NL*
some
giant
she
could
not
see
.
But
the
big
breaths
of
rough
fresh
air
*NL*
blown
over
the
heather
filled
her
lungs
with
something
which
was
good
*NL*
for
her
whole
thin
body
and
whipped
some
red
color
into
her
cheeks
and
*NL*
brightened
her
dull
eyes
when
she
did
not
know
anything
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
a
few
days
spent
almost
entirely
out
of
doors
she
wakened
one
*NL*
morning
knowing
what
it
was
to
be
hungry
,
and
when
she
sat
down
to
her
*NL*
breakfast
she
did
not
glance
disdainfully
at
her
porridge
and
push
it
*NL*
away
,
but
took
up
her
spoon
and
began
to
eat
it
and
went
on
eating
it
*NL*
until
her
bowl
was
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
got
on
well
enough
with
that
this
mornin
'
,
did
n't
tha
'
?
''
said
*NL*
Martha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
tastes
nice
today
,
''
said
Mary
,
feeling
a
little
surprised
her
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
th
'
air
of
th
'
moor
that
's
givin
'
thee
stomach
for
tha
'
*NL*
victuals
,
''
answered
Martha
.
``
It
's
lucky
for
thee
that
tha
's
got
*NL*
victuals
as
well
as
appetite
.
There
's
been
twelve
in
our
cottage
as
*NL*
had
th
'
stomach
an
'
nothin
'
to
put
in
it
.
You
go
on
playin
'
you
out
o
'
*NL*
doors
every
day
an
'
you
'll
get
some
flesh
on
your
bones
an
'
you
wo
n't
*NL*
be
so
yeller
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
play
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
have
nothing
to
play
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothin
'
to
play
with
!
''
exclaimed
Martha
.
``
Our
children
plays
with
*NL*
sticks
and
stones
.
They
just
runs
about
an
'
shouts
an
'
looks
at
*NL*
things
.
''
Mary
did
not
shout
,
but
she
looked
at
things
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
else
to
do
.
She
walked
round
and
round
the
gardens
and
*NL*
wandered
about
the
paths
in
the
park
.
Sometimes
she
looked
for
Ben
*NL*
Weatherstaff
,
but
though
several
times
she
saw
him
at
work
he
was
too
*NL*
busy
to
look
at
her
or
was
too
surly
.
Once
when
she
was
walking
toward
*NL*
him
he
picked
up
his
spade
and
turned
away
as
if
he
did
it
on
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
place
she
went
to
oftener
than
to
any
other
.
It
was
the
long
walk
*NL*
outside
the
gardens
with
the
walls
round
them
.
There
were
bare
*NL*
flower-beds
on
either
side
of
it
and
against
the
walls
ivy
grew
*NL*
thickly
.
There
was
one
part
of
the
wall
where
the
creeping
dark
green
*NL*
leaves
were
more
bushy
than
elsewhere
.
It
seemed
as
if
for
a
long
time
*NL*
that
part
had
been
neglected
.
The
rest
of
it
had
been
clipped
and
made
*NL*
to
look
neat
,
but
at
this
lower
end
of
the
walk
it
had
not
been
trimmed
*NL*
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
after
she
had
talked
to
Ben
Weatherstaff
,
Mary
stopped
to
*NL*
notice
this
and
wondered
why
it
was
so
.
She
had
just
paused
and
was
*NL*
looking
up
at
a
long
spray
of
ivy
swinging
in
the
wind
when
she
saw
a
*NL*
gleam
of
scarlet
and
heard
a
brilliant
chirp
,
and
there
,
on
the
top
of
*NL*
the
wall
,
forward
perched
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
robin
redbreast
,
tilting
*NL*
forward
to
look
at
her
with
his
small
head
on
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
cried
out
,
``
is
it
you
--
is
it
you
?
''
And
it
did
not
seem
at
all
*NL*
queer
to
her
that
she
spoke
to
him
as
if
she
were
sure
that
he
would
*NL*
understand
and
answer
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
answer
.
He
twittered
and
chirped
and
hopped
along
the
wall
as
*NL*
if
he
were
telling
her
all
sorts
of
things
.
It
seemed
to
Mistress
Mary
*NL*
as
if
she
understood
him
,
too
,
though
he
was
not
speaking
in
words
.
It
*NL*
was
as
if
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
!
Is
n't
the
wind
nice
?
Is
n't
the
sun
nice
?
Is
n't
*NL*
everything
nice
?
Let
us
both
chirp
and
hop
and
twitter
.
Come
on
!
Come
*NL*
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
began
to
laugh
,
and
as
he
hopped
and
took
little
flights
along
the
*NL*
wall
she
ran
after
him
.
Poor
little
thin
,
sallow
,
ugly
Mary
--
she
*NL*
actually
looked
almost
pretty
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
you
!
I
like
you
!
''
she
cried
out
,
pattering
down
the
walk
;
and
*NL*
she
chirped
and
tried
to
whistle
,
which
last
she
did
not
know
how
to
do
*NL*
in
the
least
.
But
the
robin
seemed
to
be
quite
satisfied
and
chirped
*NL*
and
whistled
back
at
her
.
At
last
he
spread
his
wings
and
made
a
*NL*
darting
flight
to
the
top
of
a
tree
,
where
he
perched
and
sang
loudly
.
*NL*
That
reminded
Mary
of
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
.
He
had
been
*NL*
swinging
on
a
tree-top
then
and
she
had
been
standing
in
the
orchard
.
*NL*
Now
she
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
orchard
and
standing
in
the
path
*NL*
outside
a
wall
--
much
lower
down
--
and
there
was
the
same
tree
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
in
the
garden
no
one
can
go
into
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
It
's
*NL*
the
garden
without
a
door
.
He
lives
in
there
.
How
I
wish
I
could
see
*NL*
what
it
is
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
up
the
walk
to
the
green
door
she
had
entered
the
first
*NL*
morning
.
Then
she
ran
down
the
path
through
the
other
door
and
then
*NL*
into
the
orchard
,
and
when
she
stood
and
looked
up
there
was
the
tree
*NL*
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
,
and
there
was
the
robin
just
finishing
*NL*
his
song
and
,
beginning
to
preen
his
feathers
with
his
beak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
garden
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
am
sure
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
round
and
looked
closely
at
that
side
of
the
orchard
wall
,
*NL*
but
she
only
found
what
she
had
found
before
--
that
there
was
no
door
in
*NL*
it
.
Then
she
ran
through
the
kitchen-gardens
again
and
out
into
the
*NL*
walk
outside
the
long
ivy-covered
wall
,
and
she
walked
to
the
end
of
it
*NL*
and
looked
at
it
,
but
there
was
no
door
;
and
then
she
walked
to
the
*NL*
other
end
,
looking
again
,
but
there
was
no
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
queer
,
''
she
said
.
``
Ben
Weatherstaff
said
there
was
no
door
*NL*
and
there
is
no
door
.
But
there
must
have
been
one
ten
years
ago
,
*NL*
because
Mr.
Craven
buried
the
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
gave
her
so
much
to
think
of
that
she
began
to
be
quite
interested
*NL*
and
feel
that
she
was
not
sorry
that
she
had
come
to
Misselthwaite
*NL*
Manor
.
In
India
she
had
always
felt
hot
and
too
languid
to
care
much
*NL*
about
anything
.
The
fact
was
that
the
fresh
wind
from
the
moor
had
*NL*
begun
to
blow
the
cobwebs
out
of
her
young
brain
and
to
waken
her
up
a
*NL*
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stayed
out
of
doors
nearly
all
day
,
and
when
she
sat
down
to
her
*NL*
supper
at
night
she
felt
hungry
and
drowsy
and
comfortable
.
She
did
*NL*
not
feel
cross
when
Martha
chattered
away
.
She
felt
as
if
she
rather
*NL*
liked
to
hear
her
,
and
at
last
she
thought
she
would
ask
her
a
*NL*
question
.
She
asked
it
after
she
had
finished
her
supper
and
had
sat
*NL*
down
on
the
hearth-rug
before
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
Mr.
Craven
hate
the
garden
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
made
Martha
stay
with
her
and
Martha
had
not
objected
at
all
.
*NL*
She
was
very
young
,
and
used
to
a
crowded
cottage
full
of
brothers
and
*NL*
sisters
,
and
she
found
it
dull
in
the
great
servants
'
hall
downstairs
*NL*
where
the
footman
and
upper-housemaids
made
fun
of
her
Yorkshire
speech
*NL*
and
looked
upon
her
as
a
common
little
thing
,
and
sat
and
whispered
*NL*
among
themselves
.
Martha
liked
to
talk
,
and
the
strange
child
who
had
*NL*
lived
in
India
,
and
been
waited
upon
by
``
blacks
,
''
was
novelty
enough
to
*NL*
attract
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
on
the
hearth
herself
without
waiting
to
be
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Art
tha
'
thinkin
'
about
that
garden
yet
?
''
she
said
.
``
I
knew
tha
'
*NL*
would
.
That
was
just
the
way
with
me
when
I
first
heard
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
he
hate
it
?
''
Mary
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
tucked
her
feet
under
her
and
made
herself
quite
comfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
th
'
wind
wutherin
'
round
the
house
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
could
*NL*
bare
stand
up
on
the
moor
if
you
was
out
on
it
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
did
not
know
what
``
wutherin
'
''
meant
until
she
listened
,
and
then
*NL*
she
understood
.
It
must
mean
that
hollow
shuddering
sort
of
roar
which
*NL*
rushed
round
and
round
the
house
as
if
the
giant
no
one
could
see
were
*NL*
buffeting
it
and
beating
at
the
walls
and
windows
to
try
to
break
in
.
*NL*
But
one
knew
he
could
not
get
in
,
and
somehow
it
made
one
feel
very
*NL*
safe
and
warm
inside
a
room
with
a
red
coal
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
did
he
hate
it
so
?
''
she
asked
,
after
she
had
listened
.
She
*NL*
intended
to
know
if
Martha
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Martha
gave
up
her
store
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
,
''
she
said
,
``
Mrs.
Medlock
said
it
's
not
to
be
talked
about
.
*NL*
There
's
lots
o
'
things
in
this
place
that
's
not
to
be
talked
over
.
*NL*
That
's
Mr.
Craven
's
orders
.
His
troubles
are
none
servants
'
business
,
*NL*
he
says
.
But
for
th
'
garden
he
would
n't
be
like
he
is
.
It
was
Mrs.
*NL*
Craven
's
garden
that
she
had
made
when
first
they
were
married
an
'
she
*NL*
just
loved
it
,
an
'
they
used
to
`
tend
the
flowers
themselves
.
An
'
none
*NL*
o
'
th

gardeners
was
ever
let
to
go
in

Him
an

used

go
in

*NL*
shut

door

stay
there
hours
an

hours

readin

An

*NL*
she
was
just
a
bit
of
a
girl
an

there
was
an
old
tree
with
a
branch
*NL*
bent
like
a
seat
on
it
.
An
'
she
made
roses
grow
over
it
an

she
used
*NL*
to
sit
there

But
one
day
when
she
was
sittin

there
th

broke
*NL*
an

she
fell
on
th

hurt

bad
that
next

*NL*
Th

thought

That
's
why

he
hates

No

he

let
any
one

talk
about

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
did
not
ask
any
more
questions
.
She
looked
at
the
red
fire
and
*NL*
listened
to
the
wind
``
wutherin
'
.
''
It
seemed
to
be
``
wutherin
'
''
louder
*NL*
than
ever
.
At
that
moment
a
very
good
thing
was
happening
to
her
.
*NL*
Four
good
things
had
happened
to
her
,
in
fact
,
since
she
came
to
*NL*
Misselthwaite
Manor
.
She
had
felt
as
if
she
had
understood
a
robin
and
*NL*
that
he
had
understood
her
;
she
had
run
in
the
wind
until
her
blood
had
*NL*
grown
warm
;
she
had
been
healthily
hungry
for
the
first
time
in
her
*NL*
life
;
and
she
had
found
out
what
it
was
to
be
sorry
for
some
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
she
was
listening
to
the
wind
she
began
to
listen
to
something
*NL*
else
.
She
did
not
know
what
it
was
,
because
at
first
she
could
*NL*
scarcely
distinguish
it
from
the
wind
itself
.
It
was
a
curious
*NL*
sound
--
it
seemed
almost
as
if
a
child
were
crying
somewhere
.
Sometimes
*NL*
the
wind
sounded
rather
like
a
child
crying
,
but
presently
Mistress
*NL*
Mary
felt
quite
sure
this
sound
was
inside
the
house
,
not
outside
it
.
*NL*
It
was
far
away
,
but
it
was
inside
.
She
turned
round
and
looked
at
*NL*
Martha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
any
one
crying
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
suddenly
looked
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
.
``
It
's
th
'
wind
.
Sometimes
it
sounds
like
as
if
*NL*
some
one
was
lost
on
th
'
moor
an
'
wailin
'
.
It
's
got
all
sorts
o
'
*NL*
sounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
listen
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
It
's
in
the
house
--
down
one
of
those
long
*NL*
corridors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
that
very
moment
a
door
must
have
been
opened
somewhere
*NL*
downstairs
;
for
a
great
rushing
draft
blew
along
the
passage
and
the
*NL*
door
of
the
room
they
sat
in
was
blown
open
with
a
crash
,
and
as
they
*NL*
both
jumped
to
their
feet
the
light
was
blown
out
and
the
crying
sound
*NL*
was
swept
down
the
far
corridor
so
that
it
was
to
be
heard
more
plainly
*NL*
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
told
you
so
!
It
is
some
one
crying
--
and
it
*NL*
is
n't
a
grown-up
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
ran
and
shut
the
door
and
turned
the
key
,
but
before
she
did
it
*NL*
they
both
heard
the
sound
of
a
door
in
some
far
passage
shutting
with
a
*NL*
bang
,
and
then
everything
was
quiet
,
for
even
the
wind
ceased
*NL*
``
wutherin
'
''
for
a
few
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
th
'
wind
,
''
said
Martha
stubbornly
.
``
An
'
if
it
was
n't
,
it
was
*NL*
little
Betty
Butterworth
,
th
'
scullery-maid
.
She
's
had
th
'
toothache
*NL*
all
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
something
troubled
and
awkward
in
her
manner
made
Mistress
Mary
*NL*
stare
very
hard
at
her
.
She
did
not
believe
she
was
speaking
the
truth
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
``
THERE
WAS
SOME
ONE
CRYING
--
THERE
WAS
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
the
rain
poured
down
in
torrents
again
,
and
when
Mary
*NL*
looked
out
of
her
window
the
moor
was
almost
hidden
by
gray
mist
and
*NL*
cloud
.
There
could
be
no
going
out
today
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
do
in
your
cottage
when
it
rains
like
this
?
''
she
asked
*NL*
Martha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
to
keep
from
under
each
other
's
feet
mostly
,
''
Martha
answered
.
*NL*
``
Eh
!
there
does
seem
a
lot
of
us
then
.
Mother
's
a
good-tempered
woman
*NL*
but
she
gets
fair
moithered
.
The
biggest
ones
goes
out
in
th
'
cow-shed
*NL*
and
plays
there
.
Dickon
he
does
n't
mind
th
'
wet
.
He
goes
out
just
th
'
*NL*
same
as
if
th
'
sun
was
shinin
'
.
He
says
he
sees
things
on
rainy
days
as
*NL*
does
n't
show
when
it
's
fair
weather
.
He
once
found
a
little
fox
cub
*NL*
half
drowned
in
its
hole
and
he
brought
it
home
in
th
'
bosom
of
his
*NL*
shirt
to
keep
it
warm
.
Its
mother
had
been
killed
nearby
an
'
th
'
hole
*NL*
was
swum
out
an
'
th
'
rest
o
'
th
'
litter
was
dead

He
's
got
it
at
home
*NL*
now
.
He
found
a
half-drowned
young
crow
another
time
an
'
he
brought
it
*NL*
home
,
too
,
an
'
tamed
it
.
It
's
named
Soot
because
it
's
so
black
,
an
'
it
*NL*
hops
an
'
flies
about
with
him
everywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
had
come
when
Mary
had
forgotten
to
resent
Martha
's
familiar
*NL*
talk
.
She
had
even
begun
to
find
it
interesting
and
to
be
sorry
when
*NL*
she
stopped
or
went
away
.
The
stories
she
had
been
told
by
her
Ayah
*NL*
when
she
lived
in
India
had
been
quite
unlike
those
Martha
had
to
tell
*NL*
about
the
moorland
cottage
which
held
fourteen
people
who
lived
in
four
*NL*
little
rooms
and
never
had
quite
enough
to
eat
.
The
children
seemed
to
*NL*
tumble
about
and
amuse
themselves
like
a
litter
of
rough
,
good-natured
*NL*
collie
puppies
.
Mary
was
most
attracted
by
the
mother
and
Dickon
.
*NL*
When
Martha
told
stories
of
what
``
mother
''
said
or
did
they
always
*NL*
sounded
comfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
a
raven
or
a
fox
cub
I
could
play
with
it
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
But
*NL*
I
have
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
looked
perplexed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
tha
'
knit
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
tha
'
sew
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
tha

read
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
does
n't
tha
,
read
somethin'
,
or
learn
a
bit
o

spellin
'
?
*NL*
Tha
`
st
old
enough
to
be
learnin

thy
book
a
good
bit
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
any
books
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
Those
I
had
were
left
in
India
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
pity
,
''
said
Martha
.
``
If
Mrs.
Medlock
'd
let
thee
go
into
th
'
*NL*
library
,
there
's
thousands
o
'
books
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
did
not
ask
where
the
library
was
,
because
she
was
suddenly
*NL*
inspired
by
a
new
idea
.
She
made
up
her
mind
to
go
and
find
it
*NL*
herself
.
She
was
not
troubled
about
Mrs.
Medlock
.
Mrs.
Medlock
seemed
*NL*
always
to
be
in
her
comfortable
housekeeper
's
sitting-room
downstairs
.
*NL*
In
this
queer
place
one
scarcely
ever
saw
any
one
at
all
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
there
was
no
one
to
see
but
the
servants
,
and
when
their
master
was
*NL*
away
they
lived
a
luxurious
life
below
stairs
,
where
there
was
a
huge
*NL*
kitchen
hung
about
with
shining
brass
and
pewter
,
and
a
large
servants
'
*NL*
hall
where
there
were
four
or
five
abundant
meals
eaten
every
day
,
and
*NL*
where
a
great
deal
of
lively
romping
went
on
when
Mrs.
Medlock
was
out
*NL*
of
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
meals
were
served
regularly
,
and
Martha
waited
on
her
,
but
no
*NL*
one
troubled
themselves
about
her
in
the
least
.
Mrs.
Medlock
came
and
*NL*
looked
at
her
every
day
or
two
,
but
no
one
inquired
what
she
did
or
*NL*
told
her
what
to
do
.
She
supposed
that
perhaps
this
was
the
English
*NL*
way
of
treating
children
.
In
India
she
had
always
been
attended
by
her
*NL*
Ayah
,
who
had
followed
her
about
and
waited
on
her
,
hand
and
foot
.
She
*NL*
had
often
been
tired
of
her
company
.
Now
she
was
followed
by
nobody
*NL*
and
was
learning
to
dress
herself
because
Martha
looked
as
though
she
*NL*
thought
she
was
silly
and
stupid
when
she
wanted
to
have
things
handed
*NL*
to
her
and
put
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
n't
tha
'
got
good
sense
?
''
she
said
once
,
when
Mary
had
stood
*NL*
waiting
for
her
to
put
on
her
gloves
for
her
.
``
Our
Susan
Ann
is
twice
*NL*
as
sharp
as
thee
an
'
she
's
only
four
year
'
old
.
Sometimes
tha
'
looks
*NL*
fair
soft
in
th
'
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
worn
her
contrary
scowl
for
an
hour
after
that
,
but
it
made
*NL*
her
think
several
entirely
new
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
at
the
window
for
about
ten
minutes
this
morning
after
Martha
*NL*
had
swept
up
the
hearth
for
the
last
time
and
gone
downstairs
.
She
was
*NL*
thinking
over
the
new
idea
which
had
come
to
her
when
she
heard
of
the
*NL*
library
.
She
did
not
care
very
much
about
the
library
itself
,
because
*NL*
she
had
read
very
few
books
;
but
to
hear
of
it
brought
back
to
her
mind
*NL*
the
hundred
rooms
with
closed
doors
.
She
wondered
if
they
were
all
*NL*
really
locked
and
what
she
would
find
if
she
could
get
into
any
of
*NL*
them
.
Were
there
a
hundred
really
?
Why
should
n't
she
go
and
see
how
*NL*
many
doors
she
could
count
?
It
would
be
something
to
do
on
this
morning
*NL*
when
she
could
not
go
out
.
She
had
never
been
taught
to
ask
permission
*NL*
to
do
things
,
and
she
knew
nothing
at
all
about
authority
,
so
she
would
*NL*
not
have
thought
it
necessary
to
ask
Mrs.
Medlock
if
she
might
walk
*NL*
about
the
house
,
even
if
she
had
seen
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
the
door
of
the
room
and
went
into
the
corridor
,
and
then
*NL*
she
began
her
wanderings
.
It
was
a
long
corridor
and
it
branched
into
*NL*
other
corridors
and
it
led
her
up
short
flights
of
steps
which
mounted
*NL*
to
others
again
.
There
were
doors
and
doors
,
and
there
were
pictures
*NL*
on
the
walls
.
Sometimes
they
were
pictures
of
dark
,
curious
*NL*
landscapes
,
but
oftenest
they
were
portraits
of
men
and
women
in
queer
,
*NL*
grand
costumes
made
of
satin
and
velvet
.
She
found
herself
in
one
long
*NL*
gallery
whose
walls
were
covered
with
these
portraits
.
She
had
never
*NL*
thought
there
could
be
so
many
in
any
house
.
She
walked
slowly
down
*NL*
this
place
and
stared
at
the
faces
which
also
seemed
to
stare
at
her
.
*NL*
She
felt
as
if
they
were
wondering
what
a
little
girl
from
India
was
*NL*
doing
in
their
house
.
Some
were
pictures
of
children
--
little
girls
in
*NL*
thick
satin
frocks
which
reached
to
their
feet
and
stood
out
about
*NL*
them
,
and
boys
with
puffed
sleeves
and
lace
collars
and
long
hair
,
or
*NL*
with
big
ruffs
around
their
necks
.
She
always
stopped
to
look
at
the
*NL*
children
,
and
wonder
what
their
names
were
,
and
where
they
had
gone
,
*NL*
and
why
they
wore
such
odd
clothes
.
There
was
a
stiff
,
plain
little
*NL*
girl
rather
like
herself
.
She
wore
a
green
brocade
dress
and
held
a
*NL*
green
parrot
on
her
finger
.
Her
eyes
had
a
sharp
,
curious
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
live
now
?
''
said
Mary
aloud
to
her
.
``
I
wish
you
were
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Surely
no
other
little
girl
ever
spent
such
a
queer
morning
.
It
seemed
*NL*
as
if
there
was
no
one
in
all
the
huge
rambling
house
but
her
own
small
*NL*
self
,
wandering
about
upstairs
and
down
,
through
narrow
passages
and
*NL*
wide
ones
,
where
it
seemed
to
her
that
no
one
but
herself
had
ever
*NL*
walked
.
Since
so
many
rooms
had
been
built
,
people
must
have
lived
in
*NL*
them
,
but
it
all
seemed
so
empty
that
she
could
not
quite
believe
it
*NL*
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
until
she
climbed
to
the
second
floor
that
she
thought
of
*NL*
turning
the
handle
of
a
door
.
All
the
doors
were
shut
,
as
Mrs.
Medlock
*NL*
had
said
they
were
,
but
at
last
she
put
her
hand
on
the
handle
of
one
*NL*
of
them
and
turned
it
.
She
was
almost
frightened
for
a
moment
when
she
*NL*
felt
that
it
turned
without
difficulty
and
that
when
she
pushed
upon
*NL*
the
door
itself
it
slowly
and
heavily
opened
.
It
was
a
massive
door
*NL*
and
opened
into
a
big
bedroom
.
There
were
embroidered
hangings
on
the
*NL*
wall
,
and
inlaid
furniture
such
as
she
had
seen
in
India
stood
about
*NL*
the
room
.
A
broad
window
with
leaded
panes
looked
out
upon
the
moor
;
*NL*
and
over
the
mantel
was
another
portrait
of
the
stiff
,
plain
little
*NL*
girl
who
seemed
to
stare
at
her
more
curiously
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
she
slept
here
once
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
She
stares
at
me
so
that
*NL*
she
makes
me
feel
queer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
she
opened
more
doors
and
more
.
She
saw
so
many
rooms
that
*NL*
she
became
quite
tired
and
began
to
think
that
there
must
be
a
hundred
,
*NL*
though
she
had
not
counted
them
.
In
all
of
them
there
were
old
*NL*
pictures
or
old
tapestries
with
strange
scenes
worked
on
them
.
There
*NL*
were
curious
pieces
of
furniture
and
curious
ornaments
in
nearly
all
of
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
room
,
which
looked
like
a
lady
's
sitting-room
,
the
hangings
were
*NL*
all
embroidered
velvet
,
and
in
a
cabinet
were
about
a
hundred
little
*NL*
elephants
made
of
ivory
.
They
were
of
different
sizes
,
and
some
had
*NL*
their
mahouts
or
palanquins
on
their
backs
.
Some
were
much
bigger
than
*NL*
the
others
and
some
were
so
tiny
that
they
seemed
only
babies
.
Mary
*NL*
had
seen
carved
ivory
in
India
and
she
knew
all
about
elephants
.
She
*NL*
opened
the
door
of
the
cabinet
and
stood
on
a
footstool
and
played
with
*NL*
these
for
quite
a
long
time
.
When
she
got
tired
she
set
the
elephants
*NL*
in
order
and
shut
the
door
of
the
cabinet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
her
wanderings
through
the
long
corridors
and
the
empty
rooms
,
*NL*
she
had
seen
nothing
alive
;
but
in
this
room
she
saw
something
.
Just
*NL*
after
she
had
closed
the
cabinet
door
she
heard
a
tiny
rustling
sound
.
*NL*
It
made
her
jump
and
look
around
at
the
sofa
by
the
fireplace
,
from
*NL*
which
it
seemed
to
come
.
In
the
corner
of
the
sofa
there
was
a
*NL*
cushion
,
and
in
the
velvet
which
covered
it
there
was
a
hole
,
and
out
*NL*
of
the
hole
peeped
a
tiny
head
with
a
pair
of
frightened
eyes
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
crept
softly
across
the
room
to
look
.
The
bright
eyes
belonged
to
*NL*
a
little
gray
mouse
,
and
the
mouse
had
eaten
a
hole
into
the
cushion
*NL*
and
made
a
comfortable
nest
there
.
Six
baby
mice
were
cuddled
up
*NL*
asleep
near
her
.
If
there
was
no
one
else
alive
in
the
hundred
rooms
*NL*
there
were
seven
mice
who
did
not
look
lonely
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
would
n't
be
so
frightened
I
would
take
them
back
with
me
,
''
*NL*
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
wandered
about
long
enough
to
feel
too
tired
to
wander
any
*NL*
farther
,
and
she
turned
back
.
Two
or
three
times
she
lost
her
way
by
*NL*
turning
down
the
wrong
corridor
and
was
obliged
to
ramble
up
and
down
*NL*
until
she
found
the
right
one
;
but
at
last
she
reached
her
own
floor
*NL*
again
,
though
she
was
some
distance
from
her
own
room
and
did
not
know
*NL*
exactly
where
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
I
have
taken
a
wrong
turning
again
,
''
she
said
,
standing
*NL*
still
at
what
seemed
the
end
of
a
short
passage
with
tapestry
on
the
*NL*
wall
.
``
I
do
n't
know
which
way
to
go
.
How
still
everything
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
while
she
was
standing
here
and
just
after
she
had
said
this
*NL*
that
the
stillness
was
broken
by
a
sound
.
It
was
another
cry
,
but
not
*NL*
quite
like
the
one
she
had
heard
last
night
;
it
was
only
a
short
one
,
a
*NL*
fretful
childish
whine
muffled
by
passing
through
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nearer
than
it
was
,
''
said
Mary
,
her
heart
beating
rather
faster
.
*NL*
``
And
it
is
crying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
hand
accidentally
upon
the
tapestry
near
her
,
and
then
*NL*
sprang
back
,
feeling
quite
startled
.
The
tapestry
was
the
covering
of
*NL*
a
door
which
fell
open
and
showed
her
that
there
was
another
part
of
*NL*
the
corridor
behind
it
,
and
Mrs.
Medlock
was
coming
up
it
with
her
*NL*
bunch
of
keys
in
her
hand
and
a
very
cross
look
on
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
here
?
''
she
said
,
and
she
took
Mary
by
the
arm
and
*NL*
pulled
her
away
.
``
What
did
I
tell
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
turned
round
the
wrong
corner
,
''
explained
Mary
.
``
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
which
way
to
go
and
I
heard
some
one
crying
.
''
She
quite
hated
Mrs.
*NL*
Medlock
at
the
moment
,
but
she
hated
her
more
the
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
hear
anything
of
the
sort
,
''
said
the
housekeeper
.
``
You
*NL*
come
along
back
to
your
own
nursery
or
I
'll
box
your
ears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
took
her
by
the
arm
and
half
pushed
,
half
pulled
her
up
one
*NL*
passage
and
down
another
until
she
pushed
her
in
at
the
door
of
her
own
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
stay
where
you
're
told
to
stay
or
you
'll
find
*NL*
yourself
locked
up
.
The
master
had
better
get
you
a
governess
,
same
as
*NL*
he
said
he
would
.
You
're
one
that
needs
some
one
to
look
sharp
after
*NL*
you
.
I
've
got
enough
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
out
of
the
room
and
slammed
the
door
after
her
,
and
Mary
went
*NL*
and
sat
on
the
hearth-rug
,
pale
with
rage
.
She
did
not
cry
,
but
ground
*NL*
her
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
some
one
crying
--
there
was
--
there
was
!
''
she
said
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
heard
it
twice
now
,
and
sometime
she
would
find
out
.
She
had
*NL*
found
out
a
great
deal
this
morning
.
She
felt
as
if
she
had
been
on
a
*NL*
long
journey
,
and
at
any
rate
she
had
had
something
to
amuse
her
all
*NL*
the
time
,
and
she
had
played
with
the
ivory
elephants
and
had
seen
the
*NL*
gray
mouse
and
its
babies
in
their
nest
in
the
velvet
cushion
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
KEY
TO
THE
GARDEN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
after
this
,
when
Mary
opened
her
eyes
she
sat
upright
in
bed
*NL*
immediately
,
and
called
to
Martha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
the
moor
!
Look
at
the
moor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rainstorm
had
ended
and
the
gray
mist
and
clouds
had
been
swept
*NL*
away
in
the
night
by
the
wind
.
The
wind
itself
had
ceased
and
a
*NL*
brilliant
,
deep
blue
sky
arched
high
over
the
moorland
.
Never
,
never
*NL*
had
Mary
dreamed
of
a
sky
so
blue
.
In
India
skies
were
hot
and
*NL*
blazing
;
this
was
of
a
deep
cool
blue
which
almost
seemed
to
sparkle
*NL*
like
the
waters
of
some
lovely
bottomless
lake
,
and
here
and
there
,
*NL*
high
,
high
in
the
arched
blueness
floated
small
clouds
of
snow-white
*NL*
fleece
.
The
far-reaching
world
of
the
moor
itself
looked
softly
blue
*NL*
instead
of
gloomy
purple-black
or
awful
dreary
gray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
''
said
Martha
with
a
cheerful
grin
.
``
Th
'
storm
's
over
for
a
bit
.
*NL*
It
does
like
this
at
this
time
o
'
th
'
year
.
It
goes
off
in
a
night
*NL*
like
it
was
pretendin
'
it
had
never
been
here
an
'
never
meant
to
come
*NL*
again
.
That
's
because
th
'
springtime
's
on
its
way
.
It
's
a
long
way
*NL*
off
yet
,
but
it
's
comin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
perhaps
it
always
rained
or
looked
dark
in
England
,
''
Mary
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
no
!
''
said
Martha
,
sitting
up
on
her
heels
among
her
black
lead
*NL*
brushes
.
``
Nowt
o
'
th
'
soart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
that
mean
?
''
asked
Mary
seriously
.
In
India
the
natives
*NL*
spoke
different
dialects
which
only
a
few
people
understood
,
so
she
was
*NL*
not
surprised
when
Martha
used
words
she
did
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
laughed
as
she
had
done
the
first
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
've
talked
broad
Yorkshire
again
like
Mrs.
*NL*
Medlock
said
I
must
n't
.
`
Nowt
o
'
th
'
soart
'
means
*NL*
`
nothin
'
-
of-the-sort
,
'
''
slowly
and
carefully
,
``
but
it
takes
so
long
to
*NL*
say
it
.
Yorkshire
's
th
'
sunniest
place
on
earth
when
it
is
sunny
.
I
*NL*
told
thee
tha
'd
like
th
'
moor
after
a
bit
.
Just
you
wait
till
you
see
*NL*
th
'
gold-colored
gorse
blossoms
an

th
'
blossoms
o

th

.
You
'll
*NL*
want
to
get
out
on
it
as
sunrise
an
'
live
out
on
it
all
day
like
Dickon
*NL*
does
.
''
``
Could
I
ever
get
there
?
''
asked
Mary
wistfully
,
looking
through
*NL*
her
window
at
the
far-off
blue
.
It
was
so
new
and
big
and
wonderful
*NL*
and
such
a
heavenly
color
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
answered
Martha
.
``
Tha
's
never
used
tha
'
legs
since
*NL*
tha

was
born

it
seems
to
me

Tha

It

*NL*
five
mile
to
our
cottage

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
your
cottage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
stared
at
her
a
moment
curiously
before
she
took
up
her
*NL*
polishing
brush
and
began
to
rub
the
grate
again
.
She
was
thinking
*NL*
that
the
small
plain
face
did
not
look
quite
as
sour
at
this
moment
as
*NL*
it
had
done
the
first
morning
she
saw
it
.
It
looked
just
a
trifle
like
*NL*
little
Susan
Ann
's
when
she
wanted
something
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
ask
my
mother
about
it
,
''
she
said
.
``
She
's
one
o
'
them
that
*NL*
nearly
always
sees
a
way
to
do
things
.
It
's
my
day
out
today
an

I
'm
*NL*
goin

home
.
Eh

I
am
glad
.
Mrs.
Medlock
thinks
a
lot
o
'
mother
.
*NL*
Perhaps
she
could
talk
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
your
mother
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
tha
'
did
,
''
agreed
Martha
,
polishing
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
seen
her
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
tha
'
has
n't
,
''
replied
Martha
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
up
on
her
heels
again
and
rubbed
the
end
of
her
nose
with
the
*NL*
back
of
her
hand
as
if
puzzled
for
a
moment
,
but
she
ended
quite
*NL*
positively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
's
that
sensible
an
'
hard
workin

an

goodnatured
an
'
clean
*NL*
that
no
one
could
help
likin

her
whether
they
'd
seen
her
or
not
.
When
*NL*
I
'm
goin

home
to
her
on
my
day
out
I
just
jump
for
joy
when
I
'm
*NL*
crossin

the
moor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
Dickon
,
''
added
Mary
.
``
And
I
've
never
seen
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
said
Martha
stoutly
,
``
I
've
told
thee
that
th

an

I
wonder

staring
at
her
reflectively
,
``
what
Dickon
would
*NL*
think
of
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
like

said
Mary
in
her
stiff
,
cold
little
way
.
``
No
*NL*
one
does

*NL*
*NL*
Martha
looked
reflective
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
tha

like
thysel

?
''
she
inquired
,
really
quite
as
if
she
were
*NL*
curious
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
hesitated
a
moment
and
thought
it
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
--
really
,
''
she
answered
.
``
But
I
never
thought
of
that
*NL*
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
grinned
a
little
as
if
at
some
homely
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
said
that
to
me
once
,
''
she
said
.
``
She
was
at
her
wash-tub
an

*NL*
I
was
in
a
bad
temper

talkin

she
turns
round
on

me
an

says

How
does
tha
'
*NL*
like
thysel

?
'
It
made
me
laugh
an
'
it
brought
me
to
my
senses
in
a
*NL*
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
away
in
high
spirits
as
soon
as
she
had
given
Mary
her
*NL*
breakfast
.
She
was
going
to
walk
five
miles
across
the
moor
to
the
*NL*
cottage
,
and
she
was
going
to
help
her
mother
with
the
washing
and
do
*NL*
the
week
's
baking
and
enjoy
herself
thoroughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
felt
lonelier
than
ever
when
she
knew
she
was
no
longer
in
the
*NL*
house
.
She
went
out
into
the
garden
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
the
*NL*
first
thing
she
did
was
to
run
round
and
round
the
fountain
flower
*NL*
garden
ten
times
.
She
counted
the
times
carefully
and
when
she
had
*NL*
finished
she
felt
in
better
spirits
.
The
sunshine
made
the
whole
place
*NL*
look
different
.
The
high
,
deep
,
blue
sky
arched
over
Misselthwaite
as
*NL*
well
as
over
the
moor
,
and
she
kept
lifting
her
face
and
looking
up
*NL*
into
it
,
trying
to
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
lie
down
on
one
of
*NL*
the
little
snow-white
clouds
and
float
about
.
She
went
into
the
first
*NL*
kitchen-garden
and
found
Ben
Weatherstaff
working
there
with
two
other
*NL*
gardeners
.
The
change
in
the
weather
seemed
to
have
done
him
good
.
He
*NL*
spoke
to
her
of
his
own
accord
.
``
Springtime
's
comin
,
'
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
Can
not
tha
'
smell
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
sniffed
and
thought
she
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
smell
something
nice
and
fresh
and
damp
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
th
'
good
rich
earth
,
''
he
answered
,
digging
away
.
``
It
's
in
a
*NL*
good
humor
makin

ready

It

glad

time

It

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Mary

*NL*
*NL*
``

answered
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
soon
she
heard
the
soft
rustling
flight
of
wings
again
and
she
*NL*
knew
at
once
that
the
robin
had
come
again
.
He
was
very
pert
and
*NL*
lively
,
and
hopped
about
so
close
to
her
feet
,
and
put
his
head
on
one
*NL*
side
and
looked
at
her
so
slyly
that
she
asked
Ben
Weatherstaff
a
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
remembers
me
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remembers
thee
!
''
said
Weatherstaff
indignantly
.
``
He
knows
every
*NL*
cabbage
stump
in
th
'
gardens

let
alone
th
'
people

He
's
never
seen
a

an
'
he

bent
on
findin
'
out
all
about
thee

*NL*
Tha
's
no
need
to
try
to
hide
anything
from
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
things
stirring
down
below
in
the
dark
in
that
garden
where
he
*NL*
lives
?
''
Mary
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
garden
?
''
grunted
Weatherstaff
,
becoming
surly
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
where
the
old
rose-trees
are
.
''
She
could
not
help
asking
,
*NL*
because
she
wanted
so
much
to
know
.
``
Are
all
the
flowers
dead
,
or
do
*NL*
some
of
them
come
again
in
the
summer
?
Are
there
ever
any
roses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
him
,
''
said
Ben
Weatherstaff
,
hunching
his
shoulders
toward
the
*NL*
robin
.
``
He
's
the
only
one
as
knows
.
No
one
else
has
seen
inside
it
*NL*
for
ten
year
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
years
was
a
long
time
,
Mary
thought
.
She
had
been
born
ten
years
*NL*
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
away
,
slowly
thinking
.
She
had
begun
to
like
the
garden
*NL*
just
as
she
had
begun
to
like
the
robin
and
Dickon
and
Martha
's
mother
.
*NL*
She
was
beginning
to
like
Martha
,
too
.
That
seemed
a
good
many
people
*NL*
to
like
--
when
you
were
not
used
to
liking
.
She
thought
of
the
robin
as
*NL*
one
of
the
people
.
She
went
to
her
walk
outside
the
long
,
ivy-covered
*NL*
wall
over
which
she
could
see
the
tree-tops
;
and
the
second
time
she
*NL*
walked
up
and
down
the
most
interesting
and
exciting
thing
happened
to
*NL*
her
,
and
it
was
all
through
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
robin
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
a
chirp
and
a
twitter
,
and
when
she
looked
at
the
bare
*NL*
flower-bed
at
her
left
side
there
he
was
hopping
about
and
pretending
*NL*
to
peck
things
out
of
the
earth
to
persuade
her
that
he
had
not
*NL*
followed
her
.
But
she
knew
he
had
followed
her
and
the
surprise
so
*NL*
filled
her
with
delight
that
she
almost
trembled
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
remember
me
!
''
she
cried
out
.
``
You
do
!
You
are
prettier
than
*NL*
anything
else
in
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
chirped
,
and
talked
,
and
coaxed
and
he
hopped
,
and
flirted
his
tail
*NL*
and
twittered
.
It
was
as
if
he
were
talking
.
His
red
waistcoat
was
*NL*
like
satin
and
he
puffed
his
tiny
breast
out
and
was
so
fine
and
so
*NL*
grand
and
so
pretty
that
it
was
really
as
if
he
were
showing
her
how
*NL*
important
and
like
a
human
person
a
robin
could
be
.
Mistress
Mary
*NL*
forgot
that
she
had
ever
been
contrary
in
her
life
when
he
allowed
her
*NL*
to
draw
closer
and
closer
to
him
,
and
bend
down
and
talk
and
try
to
*NL*
make
something
like
robin
sounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
to
think
that
he
should
actually
let
her
come
as
near
to
him
as
*NL*
that
!
He
knew
nothing
in
the
world
would
make
her
put
out
her
hand
*NL*
toward
him
or
startle
him
in
the
least
tiniest
way
.
He
knew
it
because
*NL*
he
was
a
real
person
--
only
nicer
than
any
other
person
in
the
world
.
*NL*
She
was
so
happy
that
she
scarcely
dared
to
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flower-bed
was
not
quite
bare
.
It
was
bare
of
flowers
because
the
*NL*
perennial
plants
had
been
cut
down
for
their
winter
rest
,
but
there
*NL*
were
tall
shrubs
and
low
ones
which
grew
together
at
the
back
of
the
*NL*
bed
,
and
as
the
robin
hopped
about
under
them
she
saw
him
hop
over
a
*NL*
small
pile
of
freshly
turned
up
earth
.
He
stopped
on
it
to
look
for
a
*NL*
worm
.
The
earth
had
been
turned
up
because
a
dog
had
been
trying
to
*NL*
dig
up
a
mole
and
he
had
scratched
quite
a
deep
hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
looked
at
it
,
not
really
knowing
why
the
hole
was
there
,
and
as
*NL*
she
looked
she
saw
something
almost
buried
in
the
newly-turned
soil
.
*NL*
It
was
something
like
a
ring
of
rusty
iron
or
brass
and
when
the
robin
*NL*
flew
up
into
a
tree
nearby
she
put
out
her
hand
and
picked
the
ring
up
.
*NL*
It
was
more
than
a
ring
,
however
;
it
was
an
old
key
which
looked
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
buried
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
stood
up
and
looked
at
it
with
an
almost
frightened
face
*NL*
as
it
hung
from
her
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
has
been
buried
for
ten
years
,
''
she
said
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
is
the
key
to
the
garden
!

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
ROBIN
WHO
SHOWED
THE
WAY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
the
key
quite
a
long
time
.
She
turned
it
over
and
over
,
*NL*
and
thought
about
it
.
As
I
have
said
before
,
she
was
not
a
child
who
*NL*
had
been
trained
to
ask
permission
or
consult
her
elders
about
things
.
*NL*
All
she
thought
about
the
key
was
that
if
it
was
the
key
to
the
closed
*NL*
garden
,
and
she
could
find
out
where
the
door
was
,
she
could
perhaps
*NL*
open
it
and
see
what
was
inside
the
walls
,
and
what
had
happened
to
the
*NL*
old
rose-trees
.
It
was
because
it
had
been
shut
up
so
long
that
she
*NL*
wanted
to
see
it
.
It
seemed
as
if
it
must
be
different
from
other
*NL*
places
and
that
something
strange
must
have
happened
to
it
during
ten
*NL*
years
.
Besides
that
,
if
she
liked
it
she
could
go
into
it
every
day
*NL*
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
,
and
she
could
make
up
some
play
of
her
*NL*
own
and
play
it
quite
alone
,
because
nobody
would
ever
know
where
she
*NL*
was
,
but
would
think
the
door
was
still
locked
and
the
key
buried
in
*NL*
the
earth
.
The
thought
of
that
pleased
her
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
Living
as
it
were
,
all
by
herself
in
a
house
with
a
hundred
*NL*
mysteriously
closed
rooms
and
having
nothing
whatever
to
do
to
amuse
*NL*
herself
,
had
set
her
inactive
brain
to
working
and
was
actually
*NL*
awakening
her
imagination
.
There
is
no
doubt
that
the
fresh
,
strong
,
*NL*
pure
air
from
the
moor
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
.
Just
as
it
had
*NL*
given
her
an
appetite
,
and
fighting
with
the
wind
had
stirred
her
*NL*
blood
,
so
the
same
things
had
stirred
her
mind
.
In
India
she
had
*NL*
always
been
too
hot
and
languid
and
weak
to
care
much
about
anything
,
*NL*
but
in
this
place
she
was
beginning
to
care
and
to
want
to
do
new
*NL*
things
.
Already
she
felt
less
``
contrary
,
''
though
she
did
not
know
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
the
key
in
her
pocket
and
walked
up
and
down
her
walk
.
No
one
*NL*
but
herself
ever
seemed
to
come
there
,
so
she
could
walk
slowly
and
*NL*
look
at
the
wall
,
or
,
rather
,
at
the
ivy
growing
on
it
.
The
ivy
was
*NL*
the
baffling
thing
.
Howsoever
carefully
she
looked
she
could
see
*NL*
nothing
but
thickly
growing
,
glossy
,
dark
green
leaves
.
She
was
very
*NL*
much
disappointed
.
Something
of
her
contrariness
came
back
to
her
as
*NL*
she
paced
the
walk
and
looked
over
it
at
the
tree-tops
inside
.
It
*NL*
seemed
so
silly
,
she
said
to
herself
,
to
be
near
it
and
not
be
able
to
*NL*
get
in
.
She
took
the
key
in
her
pocket
when
she
went
back
to
the
*NL*
house
,
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
always
carry
it
with
her
*NL*
when
she
went
out
,
so
that
if
she
ever
should
find
the
hidden
door
she
*NL*
would
be
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Medlock
had
allowed
Martha
to
sleep
all
night
at
the
cottage
,
but
*NL*
she
was
back
at
her
work
in
the
morning
with
cheeks
redder
than
ever
*NL*
and
in
the
best
of
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
up
at
four
o'clock
,
''
she
said
.
``
Eh
!
it
was
pretty
on
th
'
moor
*NL*
with
th
'
birds
gettin
'
up
an
'
th
'
rabbits
scamperin
'
about
an
'
th
'
sun
*NL*
risin

.
I
did
n't
walk
all
th
'
way
.
A
man
gave
me
a
ride
in
his
cart
*NL*
an
'
I
did
enjoy
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
full
of
stories
of
the
delights
of
her
day
out
.
Her
mother
had
*NL*
been
glad
to
see
her
and
they
had
got
the
baking
and
washing
all
out
of
*NL*
the
way
.
She
had
even
made
each
of
the
children
a
doughcake
with
a
bit
*NL*
of
brown
sugar
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
'em
all
pipin
'
hot
when
they
came
in
from
playin
'
on
th
'
moor
.
*NL*
An
'
th
'
cottage
all
smelt
o
'
nice
,
clean
hot
bakin
'
an
'
there
was
a
*NL*
good
fire
,
an
'
they
just
shouted
for
joy
.
Our
Dickon
he
said
our
*NL*
cottage
was
good
enough
for
a
king
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
they
had
all
sat
round
the
fire
,
and
Martha
and
her
*NL*
mother
had
sewed
patches
on
torn
clothes
and
mended
stockings
and
*NL*
Martha
had
told
them
about
the
little
girl
who
had
come
from
India
and
*NL*
who
had
been
waited
on
all
her
life
by
what
Martha
called
``
blacks
''
*NL*
until
she
did
n't
know
how
to
put
on
her
own
stockings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
they
did
like
to
hear
about
you
,
''
said
Martha
.
``
They
wanted
to
*NL*
know
all
about
th
'
blacks
an
'
about
th
'
ship
you
came
in
.
I
could
n't
*NL*
tell
'em
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
reflected
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
a
great
deal
more
before
your
next
day
out
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
``
so
that
you
will
have
more
to
talk
about
.
I
dare
say
they
would
like
*NL*
to
hear
about
riding
on
elephants
and
camels
,
and
about
the
officers
*NL*
going
to
hunt
tigers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
!
''
cried
delighted
Martha
.
``
It
would
set
'em
clean
off
their
*NL*
heads
.
Would
tha
'
really
do
that
,
Miss
?
It
would
be
same
as
a
wild
*NL*
beast
show
like
we
heard
they
had
in
York
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
India
is
quite
different
from
Yorkshire
,
''
Mary
said
slowly
,
as
she
*NL*
thought
the
matter
over
.
``
I
never
thought
of
that
.
Did
Dickon
and
*NL*
your
mother
like
to
hear
you
talk
about
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
our
Dickon
's
eyes
nearly
started
out
o
'
his
head
,
they
got
that
*NL*
round

''
answered
Martha
.
``
But
mother
,
she
was
put
out
about
your
*NL*
seemin

She
said
,
`
Has

got
*NL*
no
governess
for
her
,
nor
no
nurse
?
'
and
I
said
,
`
No

he
has
n't
,
though
*NL*
Mrs.
Medlock
says
he
will
when
he
thinks
of
it
,
but
she
says
he
may
n't
*NL*
think
of
it
for
two
or
three
years
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
a
governess
,
''
said
Mary
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
mother
says
you
ought
to
be
learnin
'
your
book
by
this
time
an

*NL*
you
ought
to
have
a
woman
to
look
after
you

an
'
she
says
:
`
Now
,
*NL*
Martha
,
you
just
think
how
you
'd
feel
yourself
,
in
a
big
place
like
*NL*
that
,
wanderin

about
all
alone
,
an
'
no

You
do
your
best
to
*NL*
cheer
her
up

she
says
,
an

I
said
I
would

*NL*
*NL*
Mary
gave
her
a
long
,
steady
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
cheer
me
up

she
said
.
``
I
like
to
hear
you
talk

*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Martha
went
out
of
the
room
and
came
back
with
something
held
*NL*
in
her
hands
under
her
apron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
tha
'
think

she
said
,
with
a
cheerful
grin
.
``
I
've
brought

thee
a
present

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

exclaimed
Mistress
Mary
.
How
could
a
cottage
full
of
*NL*
fourteen
hungry
people
give
any
one
a
present
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

Martha
explained

``
An
'
*NL*
he
stopped
his
cart
at
our
door
.
He
had
pots
an
'
pans
an
'
odds
an
'
*NL*
ends
,
but
mother
had
no
money
to
buy
anythin

.
Just
as
he
was
goin

*NL*
away
our
`
Lizabeth
Ellen
called
out
,
`
Mother
,
he
's
got
skippin

ropes
*NL*
with
red
an

blue
handles

An

mother
she
calls
out
quite
sudden
,
*NL*
`
Here
,
stop

mister
!
How
much
are
they
?
'
An
'
he
says
`
Tuppence

,
an

*NL*
mother
she
began
fumblin

in
her
pocket
an

she
says
to
me

Martha

I

just
goin

to
take
tuppence
out
of

*NL*
buy
that
child
a
skippin
'

rope
,
'
an
'
she
bought
one
an
'
here
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
brought
it
out
from
under
her
apron
and
exhibited
it
quite
proudly
.
*NL*
It
was
a
strong
,
slender
rope
with
a
striped
red
and
blue
handle
at
*NL*
each
end
,
but
Mary
Lennox
had
never
seen
a
skipping-rope
before
.
She
*NL*
gazed
at
it
with
a
mystified
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
for
?
''
she
asked
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
!
''
cried
out
Martha
.
``
Does
tha
'
mean
that
they
've
not
got
*NL*
skippin
'
-
ropes
in
India
,
for
all
they
've
got
elephants
and
tigers
and
*NL*
camels
!
No
wonder
most
of
'em
's
black
.
This
is
what
it
's
for
;
just
*NL*
watch
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
ran
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
,
taking
a
handle
in
each
*NL*
hand
,
began
to
skip
,
and
skip
,
and
skip
,
while
Mary
turned
in
her
chair
*NL*
to
stare
at
her
,
and
the
queer
faces
in
the
old
portraits
seemed
to
*NL*
stare
at
her
,
too
,
and
wonder
what
on
earth
this
common
little
cottager
*NL*
had
the
impudence
to
be
doing
under
their
very
noses
.
But
Martha
did
*NL*
not
even
see
them
.
The
interest
and
curiosity
in
Mistress
Mary
's
face
*NL*
delighted
her
,
and
she
went
on
skipping
and
counted
as
she
skipped
*NL*
until
she
had
reached
a
hundred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
skip
longer
than
that
,
''
she
said
when
she
stopped
.
``
I
've
*NL*
skipped
as
much
as
five
hundred
when
I
was
twelve
,
but
I
was
n't
as
fat
*NL*
then
as
I
am
now
,
an
'
I
was
in
practice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
got
up
from
her
chair
beginning
to
feel
excited
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
nice
,
''
she
said
.
``
Your
mother
is
a
kind
woman
.
Do
you
think
*NL*
I
could
ever
skip
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
just
try
it
,
''
urged
Martha
,
handing
her
the
skipping-rope
.
``
You
*NL*
ca
n't
skip
a
hundred
at
first
,
but
if
you
practice
you
'll
mount
up
.
*NL*
That
's
what
mother
said
.
She
says
,
`
Nothin
'
will
do
her
more
good
than
*NL*
skippin
'
rope
.
It
's
th
'
sensiblest
toy
a
child
can
have
.
Let
her
play
*NL*
out
in
th
'
fresh
air
skippin
'
an
'
it
'll
stretch
her
legs
an
'
arms
an
'
*NL*
give
her
some
strength
in
'em
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
plain
that
there
was
not
a
great
deal
of
strength
in
Mistress
*NL*
Mary
's
arms
and
legs
when
she
first
began
to
skip
.
She
was
not
very
*NL*
clever
at
it
,
but
she
liked
it
so
much
that
she
did
not
want
to
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
on
tha
'
things
and
run
an
'
skip
out
o
'
doors
,
''
said
Martha
.
*NL*
``
Mother
said
I
must
tell
you
to
keep
out
o

doors
as
much
as
you
could

*NL*

it
rains
a
bit
,
so
as
tha
'
wrap

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
put
on
her
coat
and
hat
and
took
her
skipping-rope
over
her
arm
.
*NL*
She
opened
the
door
to
go
out
,
and
then
suddenly
thought
of
something
*NL*
and
turned
back
rather
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Martha
,
''
she
said
,
``
they
were
your
wages
.
It
was
your
two-pence
*NL*
really
.
Thank
you
.
''
She
said
it
stiffly
because
she
was
not
used
to
*NL*
thanking
people
or
noticing
that
they
did
things
for
her
.
``
Thank
you
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
and
held
out
her
hand
because
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
*NL*
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
gave
her
hand
a
clumsy
little
shake
,
as
if
she
was
not
*NL*
accustomed
to
this
sort
of
thing
either
.
Then
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
th
'
art
a
queer
,
old-womanish
thing
,
''
she
said
.
``
If
tha
'd
been
*NL*
our
`
Lizabeth
Ellen
tha
'd
have
given
me
a
kiss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
looked
stiffer
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
me
to
kiss
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
not
me
,
''
she
answered
.
``
If
tha
'
was
different
,
p
`
raps
tha
'd
want
*NL*
to
thysel
'
.
But
tha

is
n't
.
Run
off
outside
an
'
play
with
thy
rope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
felt
a
little
awkward
as
she
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
Yorkshire
people
seemed
strange
,
and
Martha
was
always
rather
a
puzzle
*NL*
to
her
.
At
first
she
had
disliked
her
very
much
,
but
now
she
did
not
.
*NL*
The
skipping-rope
was
a
wonderful
thing
.
She
counted
and
skipped
,
and
*NL*
skipped
and
counted
,
until
her
cheeks
were
quite
red
,
and
she
was
more
*NL*
interested
than
she
had
ever
been
since
she
was
born
.
The
sun
was
*NL*
shining
and
a
little
wind
was
blowing
--
not
a
rough
wind
,
but
one
which
*NL*
came
in
delightful
little
gusts
and
brought
a
fresh
scent
of
newly
*NL*
turned
earth
with
it
.
She
skipped
round
the
fountain
garden
,
and
up
*NL*
one
walk
and
down
another
.
She
skipped
at
last
into
the
kitchen-garden
*NL*
and
saw
Ben
Weatherstaff
digging
and
talking
to
his
robin
,
which
was
*NL*
hopping
about
him
.
She
skipped
down
the
walk
toward
him
and
he
lifted
*NL*
his
head
and
looked
at
her
with
a
curious
expression
.
She
had
wondered
*NL*
if
he
would
notice
her
.
She
wanted
him
to
see
her
skip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Upon
my
word
.
P'raps

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
skipped
before

Mary
said
.
``
I
'm
just

I
can
only
*NL*

up
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Ben
.
``

*NL*
jerking
his
head
toward
the
robin
.
``
He
followed

*NL*
He

*NL*

rope

He

Eh

''
shaking
his
head
at
the
*NL*
bird
,
``
tha
'
curiosity
will
be
th
'
death
of
thee
sometime
if

*NL*
does
n't
look

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
skipped
round
all
the
gardens
and
round
the
orchard
,
resting
every
*NL*
few
minutes
.
At
length
she
went
to
her
own
special
walk
and
made
up
*NL*
her
mind
to
try
if
she
could
skip
the
whole
length
of
it
.
It
was
a
*NL*
good
long
skip
and
she
began
slowly
,
but
before
she
had
gone
half-way
*NL*
down
the
path
she
was
so
hot
and
breathless
that
she
was
obliged
to
*NL*
stop
.
She
did
not
mind
much
,
because
she
had
already
counted
up
to
*NL*
thirty
.
She
stopped
with
a
little
laugh
of
pleasure
,
and
there
,
lo
and
*NL*
behold
,
was
the
robin
swaying
on
a
long
branch
of
ivy
.
He
had
followed
*NL*
her
and
he
greeted
her
with
a
chirp
.
As
Mary
had
skipped
toward
him
*NL*
she
felt
something
heavy
in
her
pocket
strike
against
her
at
each
jump
,
*NL*
and
when
she
saw
the
robin
she
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
showed
me
where
the
key
was
yesterday
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
ought
to
*NL*
show
me
the
door
today
;
but
I
do
n't
believe
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
robin
flew
from
his
swinging
spray
of
ivy
on
to
the
top
of
the
wall
*NL*
and
he
opened
his
beak
and
sang
a
loud
,
lovely
trill
,
merely
to
show
*NL*
off
.
Nothing
in
the
world
is
quite
as
adorably
lovely
as
a
robin
when
*NL*
he
shows
off
--
and
they
are
nearly
always
doing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
Lennox
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
Magic
in
her
Ayah
's
stories
,
*NL*
and
she
always
said
that
what
happened
almost
at
that
moment
was
Magic
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
nice
little
gusts
of
wind
rushed
down
the
walk
,
and
it
was
a
*NL*
stronger
one
than
the
rest
.
It
was
strong
enough
to
wave
the
branches
*NL*
of
the
trees
,
and
it
was
more
than
strong
enough
to
sway
the
trailing
*NL*
sprays
of
untrimmed
ivy
hanging
from
the
wall
.
Mary
had
stepped
close
*NL*
to
the
robin
,
and
suddenly
the
gust
of
wind
swung
aside
some
loose
ivy
*NL*
trails
,
and
more
suddenly
still
she
jumped
toward
it
and
caught
it
in
*NL*
her
hand
.
This
she
did
because
she
had
seen
something
under
it
--
a
*NL*
round
knob
which
had
been
covered
by
the
leaves
hanging
over
it
.
It
*NL*
was
the
knob
of
a
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
hands
under
the
leaves
and
began
to
pull
and
push
them
*NL*
aside
.
Thick
as
the
ivy
hung
,
it
nearly
all
was
a
loose
and
swinging
*NL*
curtain
,
though
some
had
crept
over
wood
and
iron
.
Mary
's
heart
began
*NL*
to
thump
and
her
hands
to
shake
a
little
in
her
delight
and
excitement
.
*NL*
The
robin
kept
singing
and
twittering
away
and
tilting
his
head
on
one
*NL*
side
,
as
if
he
were
as
excited
as
she
was
.
What
was
this
under
her
*NL*
hands
which
was
square
and
made
of
iron
and
which
her
fingers
found
a
*NL*
hole
in
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
lock
of
the
door
which
had
been
closed
ten
years
and
she
put
*NL*
her
hand
in
her
pocket
,
drew
out
the
key
and
found
it
fitted
the
*NL*
keyhole
.
She
put
the
key
in
and
turned
it
.
It
took
two
hands
to
do
*NL*
it
,
but
it
did
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
she
took
a
long
breath
and
looked
behind
her
up
the
long
walk
*NL*
to
see
if
any
one
was
coming
.
No
one
was
coming
.
No
one
ever
did
*NL*
come
,
it
seemed
,
and
she
took
another
long
breath
,
because
she
could
*NL*
not
help
it
,
and
she
held
back
the
swinging
curtain
of
ivy
and
pushed
*NL*
back
the
door
which
opened
slowly
--
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
slipped
through
it
,
and
shut
it
behind
her
,
and
stood
with
her
*NL*
back
against
it
,
looking
about
her
and
breathing
quite
fast
with
*NL*
excitement
,
and
wonder
,
and
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
standing
inside
the
secret
garden
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
THE
STRANGEST
HOUSE
ANY
ONE
EVER
LIVED
IN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
sweetest
,
most
mysterious-looking
place
any
one
could
*NL*
imagine
.
The
high
walls
which
shut
it
in
were
covered
with
the
*NL*
leafless
stems
of
climbing
roses
which
were
so
thick
that
they
were
*NL*
matted
together
.
Mary
Lennox
knew
they
were
roses
because
she
had
seen
*NL*
a
great
many
roses
in
India
.
All
the
ground
was
covered
with
grass
of
*NL*
a
wintry
brown
and
out
of
it
grew
clumps
of
bushes
which
were
surely
*NL*
rosebushes
if
they
were
alive
.
There
were
numbers
of
standard
roses
*NL*
which
had
so
spread
their
branches
that
they
were
like
little
trees
.
*NL*
There
were
other
trees
in
the
garden
,
and
one
of
the
things
which
made
*NL*
the
place
look
strangest
and
loveliest
was
that
climbing
roses
had
run
*NL*
all
over
them
and
swung
down
long
tendrils
which
made
light
swaying
*NL*
curtains
,
and
here
and
there
they
had
caught
at
each
other
or
at
a
*NL*
far-reaching
branch
and
had
crept
from
one
tree
to
another
and
made
*NL*
lovely
bridges
of
themselves
.
There
were
neither
leaves
nor
roses
on
*NL*
them
now
and
Mary
did
not
know
whether
they
were
dead
or
alive
,
but
*NL*
their
thin
gray
or
brown
branches
and
sprays
looked
like
a
sort
of
hazy
*NL*
mantle
spreading
over
everything
,
walls
,
and
trees
,
and
even
brown
*NL*
grass
,
where
they
had
fallen
from
their
fastenings
and
run
along
the
*NL*
ground
.
It
was
this
hazy
tangle
from
tree
to
tree
which
made
it
all
*NL*
look
so
mysterious
.
Mary
had
thought
it
must
be
different
from
other
*NL*
gardens
which
had
not
been
left
all
by
themselves
so
long
;
and
indeed
*NL*
it
was
different
from
any
other
place
she
had
ever
seen
in
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
still
it
is
!
''
she
whispered
.
``
How
still
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
waited
a
moment
and
listened
at
the
stillness
.
The
robin
,
who
*NL*
had
flown
to
his
treetop
,
was
still
as
all
the
rest
.
He
did
not
even
*NL*
flutter
his
wings
;
he
sat
without
stirring
,
and
looked
at
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
wonder
it
is
still
,
''
she
whispered
again
.
``
I
am
the
first
person
*NL*
who
has
spoken
in
here
for
ten
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
moved
away
from
the
door
,
stepping
as
softly
as
if
she
were
afraid
*NL*
of
awakening
some
one
.
She
was
glad
that
there
was
grass
under
her
*NL*
feet
and
that
her
steps
made
no
sounds
.
She
walked
under
one
of
the
*NL*
fairy-like
gray
arches
between
the
trees
and
looked
up
at
the
sprays
*NL*
and
tendrils
which
formed
them
.
``
I
wonder
if
they
are
all
quite
dead
,
''
*NL*
she
said
.
``
Is
it
all
a
quite
dead
garden
?
I
wish
it
was
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
had
been
Ben
Weatherstaff
she
could
have
told
whether
the
wood
*NL*
was
alive
by
looking
at
it
,
but
she
could
only
see
that
there
were
only
*NL*
gray
or
brown
sprays
and
branches
and
none
showed
any
signs
of
even
a
*NL*
tiny
leaf-bud
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
inside
the
wonderful
garden
and
she
could
come
through
the
*NL*
door
under
the
ivy
any
time
and
she
felt
as
if
she
had
found
a
world
*NL*
all
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
shining
inside
the
four
walls
and
the
high
arch
of
blue
sky
*NL*
over
this
particular
piece
of
Misselthwaite
seemed
even
more
brilliant
*NL*
and
soft
than
it
was
over
the
moor
.
The
robin
flew
down
from
his
*NL*
tree-top
and
hopped
about
or
flew
after
her
from
one
bush
to
another
.
*NL*
He
chirped
a
good
deal
and
had
a
very
busy
air
,
as
if
he
were
showing
*NL*
her
things
.
Everything
was
strange
and
silent
and
she
seemed
to
be
*NL*
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
any
one
,
but
somehow
she
did
not
feel
*NL*
lonely
at
all
.
All
that
troubled
her
was
her
wish
that
she
knew
*NL*
whether
all
the
roses
were
dead
,
or
if
perhaps
some
of
them
had
lived
*NL*
and
might
put
out
leaves
and
buds
as
the
weather
got
warmer
.
She
did
*NL*
not
want
it
to
be
a
quite
dead
garden
.
If
it
were
a
quite
alive
*NL*
garden
,
how
wonderful
it
would
be
,
and
what
thousands
of
roses
would
*NL*
grow
on
every
side
!
*NL*
*NL*
Her
skipping-rope
had
hung
over
her
arm
when
she
came
in
and
after
she
*NL*
had
walked
about
for
a
while
she
thought
she
would
skip
round
the
whole
*NL*
garden
,
stopping
when
she
wanted
to
look
at
things
.
There
seemed
to
*NL*
have
been
grass
paths
here
and
there
,
and
in
one
or
two
corners
there
*NL*
were
alcoves
of
evergreen
with
stone
seats
or
tall
moss-covered
flower
*NL*
urns
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
came
near
the
second
of
these
alcoves
she
stopped
skipping
.
*NL*
There
had
once
been
a
flowerbed
in
it
,
and
she
thought
she
saw
*NL*
something
sticking
out
of
the
black
earth
--
some
sharp
little
pale
green
*NL*
points
.
She
remembered
what
Ben
Weatherstaff
had
said
and
she
knelt
*NL*
down
to
look
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
are
tiny
growing
things
and
they
might
be
crocuses
or
*NL*
snowdrops
or
daffodils
,
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bent
very
close
to
them
and
sniffed
the
fresh
scent
of
the
damp
*NL*
earth
.
She
liked
it
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
there
are
some
other
ones
coming
up
in
other
places
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
I
will
go
all
over
the
garden
and
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
skip
,
but
walked
.
She
went
slowly
and
kept
her
eyes
on
the
*NL*
ground
.
She
looked
in
the
old
border
beds
and
among
the
grass
,
and
*NL*
after
she
had
gone
round
,
trying
to
miss
nothing
,
she
had
found
ever
so
*NL*
many
more
sharp
,
pale
green
points
,
and
she
had
become
quite
excited
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
a
quite
dead
garden
,
''
she
cried
out
softly
to
herself
.
``
Even
*NL*
if
the
roses
are
dead
,
there
are
other
things
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
know
anything
about
gardening
,
but
the
grass
seemed
so
*NL*
thick
in
some
of
the
places
where
the
green
points
were
pushing
their
*NL*
way
through
that
she
thought
they
did
not
seem
to
have
room
enough
to
*NL*
grow
.
She
searched
about
until
she
found
a
rather
sharp
piece
of
wood
*NL*
and
knelt
down
and
dug
and
weeded
out
the
weeds
and
grass
until
she
*NL*
made
nice
little
clear
places
around
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
they
look
as
if
they
could
breathe
,
''
she
said
,
after
she
had
*NL*
finished
with
the
first
ones
.
``
I
am
going
to
do
ever
so
many
more
.
*NL*
I
'll
do
all
I
can
see
.
If
I
have
n't
time
today
I
can
come
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
from
place
to
place
,
and
dug
and
weeded
,
and
enjoyed
herself
*NL*
so
immensely
that
she
was
led
on
from
bed
to
bed
and
into
the
grass
*NL*
under
the
trees
.
The
exercise
made
her
so
warm
that
she
first
threw
*NL*
her
coat
off
,
and
then
her
hat
,
and
without
knowing
it
she
was
smiling
*NL*
down
on
to
the
grass
and
the
pale
green
points
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
robin
was
tremendously
busy
.
He
was
very
much
pleased
to
see
*NL*
gardening
begun
on
his
own
estate
.
He
had
often
wondered
at
Ben
*NL*
Weatherstaff
.
Where
gardening
is
done
all
sorts
of
delightful
things
*NL*
to
eat
are
turned
up
with
the
soil
.
Now
here
was
this
new
kind
of
*NL*
creature
who
was
not
half
Ben
's
size
and
yet
had
had
the
sense
to
come
*NL*
into
his
garden
and
begin
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
worked
in
her
garden
until
it
was
time
to
go
to
her
*NL*
midday
dinner
.
In
fact
,
she
was
rather
late
in
remembering
,
and
when
*NL*
she
put
on
her
coat
and
hat
,
and
picked
up
her
skipping-rope
,
she
could
*NL*
not
believe
that
she
had
been
working
two
or
three
hours
.
She
had
been
*NL*
actually
happy
all
the
time
;
and
dozens
and
dozens
of
the
tiny
,
pale
*NL*
green
points
were
to
be
seen
in
cleared
places
,
looking
twice
as
*NL*
cheerful
as
they
had
looked
before
when
the
grass
and
weeds
had
been
*NL*
smothering
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
come
back
this
afternoon
,
''
she
said
,
looking
all
round
at
her
*NL*
new
kingdom
,
and
speaking
to
the
trees
and
the
rose-bushes
as
if
they
*NL*
heard
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
ran
lightly
across
the
grass
,
pushed
open
the
slow
old
door
*NL*
and
slipped
through
it
under
the
ivy
.
She
had
such
red
cheeks
and
such
*NL*
bright
eyes
and
ate
such
a
dinner
that
Martha
was
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
pieces
o
'
meat
an
'
two
helps
o
'
rice
puddin
'
!
''
she
said
.
``
Eh
!
*NL*
mother
will
be
pleased
when
I
tell
her
what
th
'
skippin
'
-
rope
's
done
*NL*
for
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
her
digging
with
her
pointed
stick
Mistress
Mary
had
*NL*
found
herself
digging
up
a
sort
of
white
root
rather
like
an
onion
.
*NL*
She
had
put
it
back
in
its
place
and
patted
the
earth
carefully
down
on
*NL*
it
and
just
now
she
wondered
if
Martha
could
tell
her
what
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Martha
,
''
she
said
,
``
what
are
those
white
roots
that
look
like
onions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
bulbs
,
''
answered
Martha
.
``
Lots
o
'
spring
flowers
grow
from
*NL*
'em
.
Th
'
very
little
ones
are
snowdrops
an
'
crocuses
an
'
th
'
big
ones
*NL*
are
narcissuses
an
'
jonquils
and
daffydowndillys
.
Th
'
biggest
of
all
*NL*
is
lilies
an
'
purple
flags
.
Eh
!
they
are
nice
.
Dickon
's
got
a
whole
*NL*
lot
of
'em
planted
in
our
bit
o
'
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
Dickon
know
all
about
them
?
''
asked
Mary
,
a
new
idea
taking
*NL*
possession
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
Dickon
can
make
a
flower
grow
out
of
a
brick
walk
.
Mother
says
he
*NL*
just
whispers
things
out
o
'
th
'
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
bulbs
live
a
long
time
?
Would
they
live
years
and
years
if
no
one
*NL*
helped
them
?
''
inquired
Mary
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
things
as
helps
themselves
,
''
said
Martha
.
``
That
's
why
poor
*NL*
folk
can
afford
to
have
'em
.
If
you
do
n't
trouble
'em
,
most
of
'em
'll
*NL*
work
away
underground
for
a
lifetime
an
'
spread
out
an
'
have
little
*NL*
`
uns
.
There
's
a
place
in
th
'
park
woods
here
where
there
's
snowdrops
by
*NL*
thousands
.
They
're
the
prettiest
sight
in
Yorkshire
when
th
'
spring
*NL*
comes
.
No
one
knows
when
they
was
first
planted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
the
spring
was
here
now
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
want
to
see
all
the
*NL*
things
that
grow
in
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
finished
her
dinner
and
gone
to
her
favorite
seat
on
the
*NL*
hearth-rug
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
--
I
wish
I
had
a
little
spade
,
''
she
said
.
``
Whatever
does
tha
'
*NL*
want
a
spade
for
?
''
asked
Martha
,
laughing
.
``
Art
tha
'
goin
'
to
take
to
*NL*
diggin
'
?
I
must
tell
mother
that
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
looked
at
the
fire
and
pondered
a
little
.
She
must
be
careful
if
*NL*
she
meant
to
keep
her
secret
kingdom
.
She
was
n't
doing
any
harm
,
but
*NL*
if
Mr.
Craven
found
out
about
the
open
door
he
would
be
fearfully
angry
*NL*
and
get
a
new
key
and
lock
it
up
forevermore
.
She
really
could
not
*NL*
bear
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
such
a
big
lonely
place
,
''
she
said
slowly
,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
turning
matters
over
in
her
mind
.
``
The
house
is
lonely
,
and
the
park
*NL*
is
lonely
,
and
the
gardens
are
lonely
.
So
many
places
seem
shut
up
.
I
*NL*
never
did
many
things
in
India
,
but
there
were
more
people
to
look
*NL*
at
--
natives
and
soldiers
marching
by
--
and
sometimes
bands
playing
,
and
*NL*
my
Ayah
told
me
stories
.
There
is
no
one
to
talk
to
here
except
you
*NL*
and
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
And
you
have
to
do
your
work
and
Ben
*NL*
Weatherstaff
wo
n't
speak
to
me
often
.
I
thought
if
I
had
a
little
*NL*
spade
I
could
dig
somewhere
as
he
does
,
and
I
might
make
a
little
*NL*
garden
if
he
would
give
me
some
seeds

''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
's
face
quite
lighted
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
if
that
was
n't
one

``
How

Mary
asked

``
Well

Martha
's
reflective
answer
,
``
at

putting

on

eagerly

In

suddenly

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Mary
answered

*NL*
*NL*
Martha
shook
her
head

*NL*
*NL*
``
Our

go
an
'
buy
th
'
garden
tools
an
'
th
'
*NL*
seeds
at
th
'
same
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
you
're
a
good
girl
!
''
Mary
cried
.
``
You
are
,
really
!
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
you
were
so
nice
.
I
know
I
can
print
letters
if
I
try
.
Let
's
ask
Mrs.
*NL*
Medlock
for
a
pen
and
ink
and
some
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
some
of
my
own
,
''
said
Martha
.
``
I
bought
'em
so
I
could
print
*NL*
a
bit
of
a
letter
to
mother
of
a
Sunday
.
I
'll
go
and
get
it
.
''
She
ran
*NL*
out
of
the
room
,
and
Mary
stood
by
the
fire
and
twisted
her
thin
little
*NL*
hands
together
with
sheer
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
have
a
spade
,
''
she
whispered
,
``
I
can
make
the
earth
nice
and
soft
*NL*
and
dig
up
weeds
.
If
I
have
seeds
and
can
make
flowers
grow
the
garden
*NL*
wo
n't
be
dead
at
all
--
it
will
come
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
go
out
again
that
afternoon
because
when
Martha
returned
*NL*
with
her
pen
and
ink
and
paper
she
was
obliged
to
clear
the
table
and
*NL*
carry
the
plates
and
dishes
downstairs
and
when
she
got
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
Mrs.
Medlock
was
there
and
told
her
to
do
something
,
so
Mary
*NL*
waited
for
what
seemed
to
her
a
long
time
before
she
came
back
.
Then
*NL*
it
was
a
serious
piece
of
work
to
write
to
Dickon
.
Mary
had
been
*NL*
taught
very
little
because
her
governesses
had
disliked
her
too
much
to
*NL*
stay
with
her
.
She
could
not
spell
particularly
well
but
she
found
*NL*
that
she
could
print
letters
when
she
tried
.
This
was
the
letter
*NL*
Martha
dictated
to
her
:
``
My
Dear
Dickon
:
*NL*
*NL*
This
comes
hoping
to
find
you
well
as
it
leaves
me
at
present
.
Miss
*NL*
Mary
has
plenty
of
money
and
will
you
go
to
Thwaite
and
buy
her
some
*NL*
flower
seeds
and
a
set
of
garden
tools
to
make
a
flower-bed
.
Pick
the
*NL*
prettiest
ones
and
easy
to
grow
because
she
has
never
done
it
before
*NL*
and
lived
in
India
which
is
different
.
Give
my
love
to
mother
and
*NL*
every
one
of
you
.
Miss
Mary
is
going
to
tell
me
a
lot
more
so
that
on
*NL*
my
next
day
out
you
can
hear
about
elephants
and
camels
and
gentlemen
*NL*
going
hunting
lions
and
tigers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
loving
sister
,
*NL*
Martha
Phoebe
Sowerby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
put
the
money
in
th

envelope
an
'
I
'll
get
th
'
butcher
boy
to
*NL*
take
it
in
his
cart
.
He
's
a
great
friend
o
'
Dickon
's
,
''
said
Martha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
shall
I
get
the
things
when
Dickon
buys
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
bring
'em
to
you
himself
.
He
'll
like
to
walk
over
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
exclaimed
Mary
,
``
then
I
shall
see
him
!
I
never
thought
I
should
*NL*
see
Dickon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
tha
'
want
to
see
him
?
''
asked
Martha
suddenly
,
for
Mary
had
looked
*NL*
so
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
.
I
never
saw
a
boy
foxes
and
crows
loved
.
I
want
to
see
*NL*
him
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
gave
a
little
start
,
as
if
she
remembered
something
.
``
Now
to
*NL*
think
,
''
she
broke
out
,
``
to
think
o
'
me
forgettin
'
that
there
;
an
'
I
*NL*
thought
I
was
goin
'
to
tell
you
first
thing
this
mornin
'
.
I
asked
*NL*
mother
--
and
she
said
she
'd
ask
Mrs.
Medlock
her
own
self
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
--
''
Mary
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
said
Tuesday
.
Ask
her
if
you
might
be
driven
over
to
our
*NL*
cottage
some
day
and
have
a
bit
o
'
mother
's
hot
oat
cake
,
an
'
butter
,
*NL*
an
'
a
glass
o
'
milk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
if
all
the
interesting
things
were
happening
in
one
day
.
*NL*
To
think
of
going
over
the
moor
in
the
daylight
and
when
the
sky
was
*NL*
blue
!
To
think
of
going
into
the
cottage
which
held
twelve
children
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
she
think
Mrs.
Medlock
would
let
me
go
?
''
she
asked
,
quite
*NL*
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
she
thinks
she
would
.
She
knows
what
a
tidy
woman
mother
is
and
*NL*
how
clean
she
keeps
the
cottage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
went
I
should
see
your
mother
as
well
as
Dickon
,
''
said
Mary
,
*NL*
thinking
it
over
and
liking
the
idea
very
much
.
``
She
does
n't
seem
to
*NL*
be
like
the
mothers
in
India
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
work
in
the
garden
and
the
excitement
of
the
afternoon
ended
by
*NL*
making
her
feel
quiet
and
thoughtful
.
Martha
stayed
with
her
until
*NL*
tea-time
,
but
they
sat
in
comfortable
quiet
and
talked
very
little
.
*NL*
But
just
before
Martha
went
downstairs
for
the
tea-tray
,
Mary
asked
a
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Martha
,
''
she
said
,
``
has
the
scullery-maid
had
the
toothache
again
*NL*
today
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
certainly
started
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
thee
ask
that
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
when
I
waited
so
long
for
you
to
come
back
I
opened
the
door
*NL*
and
walked
down
the
corridor
to
see
if
you
were
coming
.
And
I
heard
*NL*
that
far-off
crying
again
,
just
as
we
heard
it
the
other
night
.
There
*NL*
is
n't
a
wind
today
,
so
you
see
it
could
n't
have
been
the
wind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
said
Martha
restlessly
.
``
Tha
'
must
n't
go
walkin
'
about
in
*NL*
corridors
an
'
listenin
'
.
Mr.
Craven
would
be
that
there
angry
there

*NL*
no
knowin
'
what
he
'd
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
n't
listening
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
was
just
waiting
for
you
--
and
I
*NL*
heard
it
.
That
's
three
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
!
There
's
Mrs.
Medlock
's
bell
,
''
said
Martha
,
and
she
almost
ran
*NL*
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
strangest
house
any
one
ever
lived
in
,
''
said
Mary
drowsily
,
*NL*
as
she
dropped
her
head
on
the
cushioned
seat
of
the
armchair
near
her
.
*NL*
Fresh
air
,
and
digging
,
and
skipping-rope
had
made
her
feel
so
*NL*
comfortably
tired
that
she
fell
asleep
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
DICKON
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
shone
down
for
nearly
a
week
on
the
secret
garden
.
The
Secret
*NL*
Garden
was
what
Mary
called
it
when
she
was
thinking
of
it
.
She
liked
*NL*
the
name
,
and
she
liked
still
more
the
feeling
that
when
its
beautiful
*NL*
old
walls
shut
her
in
no
one
knew
where
she
was
.
It
seemed
almost
like
*NL*
being
shut
out
of
the
world
in
some
fairy
place
.
The
few
books
she
had
*NL*
read
and
liked
had
been
fairy-story
books
,
and
she
had
read
of
secret
*NL*
gardens
in
some
of
the
stories
.
Sometimes
people
went
to
sleep
in
them
*NL*
for
a
hundred
years
,
which
she
had
thought
must
be
rather
stupid
.
She
*NL*
had
no
intention
of
going
to
sleep
,
and
,
in
fact
,
she
was
becoming
*NL*
wider
awake
every
day
which
passed
at
Misselthwaite
.
She
was
beginning
*NL*
to
like
to
be
out
of
doors
;
she
no
longer
hated
the
wind
,
but
enjoyed
*NL*
it
.
She
could
run
faster
,
and
longer
,
and
she
could
skip
up
to
a
*NL*
hundred
.
The
bulbs
in
the
secret
garden
must
have
been
much
*NL*
astonished
.
Such
nice
clear
places
were
made
round
them
that
they
had
*NL*
all
the
breathing
space
they
wanted
,
and
really
,
if
Mistress
Mary
had
*NL*
known
it
,
they
began
to
cheer
up
under
the
dark
earth
and
work
*NL*
tremendously
.
The
sun
could
get
at
them
and
warm
them
,
and
when
the
*NL*
rain
came
down
it
could
reach
them
at
once
,
so
they
began
to
feel
very
*NL*
much
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
an
odd
,
determined
little
person
,
and
now
she
had
something
*NL*
interesting
to
be
determined
about
,
she
was
very
much
absorbed
,
indeed
.
*NL*
She
worked
and
dug
and
pulled
up
weeds
steadily
,
only
becoming
more
*NL*
pleased
with
her
work
every
hour
instead
of
tiring
of
it
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
her
like
a
fascinating
sort
of
play
.
She
found
many
more
of
the
*NL*
sprouting
pale
green
points
than
she
had
ever
hoped
to
find
.
They
*NL*
seemed
to
be
starting
up
everywhere
and
each
day
she
was
sure
she
found
*NL*
tiny
new
ones
,
some
so
tiny
that
they
barely
peeped
above
the
earth
.
*NL*
There
were
so
many
that
she
remembered
what
Martha
had
said
about
the
*NL*
``
snowdrops
by
the
thousands
,
''
and
about
bulbs
spreading
and
making
new
*NL*
ones
.
These
had
been
left
to
themselves
for
ten
years
and
perhaps
they
*NL*
had
spread
,
like
the
snowdrops
,
into
thousands
.
She
wondered
how
long
*NL*
it
would
be
before
they
showed
that
they
were
flowers
.
Sometimes
she
*NL*
stopped
digging
to
look
at
the
garden
and
try
to
imagine
what
it
would
*NL*
be
like
when
it
was
covered
with
thousands
of
lovely
things
in
bloom
.
*NL*
During
that
week
of
sunshine
,
she
became
more
intimate
with
Ben
*NL*
Weatherstaff
.
She
surprised
him
several
times
by
seeming
to
start
up
*NL*
beside
him
as
if
she
sprang
out
of
the
earth
.
The
truth
was
that
she
*NL*
was
afraid
that
he
would
pick
up
his
tools
and
go
away
if
he
saw
her
*NL*
coming
,
so
she
always
walked
toward
him
as
silently
as
possible
.
But
,
*NL*
in
fact
,
he
did
not
object
to
her
as
strongly
as
he
had
at
first
.
*NL*
Perhaps
he
was
secretly
rather
flattered
by
her
evident
desire
for
his
*NL*
elderly
company
.
Then
,
also
,
she
was
more
civil
than
she
had
been
.
He
*NL*
did
not
know
that
when
she
first
saw
him
she
spoke
to
him
as
she
would
*NL*
have
spoken
to
a
native
,
and
had
not
known
that
a
cross
,
sturdy
old
*NL*
Yorkshire
man
was
not
accustomed
to
salaam
to
his
masters
,
and
be
*NL*
merely
commanded
by
them
to
do
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
`
rt
like
th
'
robin
,
''
he
said
to
her
one
morning
when
he
lifted
his
*NL*
head
and
saw
her
standing
by
him
.
``
I
never
knows
when
I
shall
see
thee
*NL*
or
which
side
tha
'll
come
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
friends
with
me
now
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
like
him
,
''
snapped
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
``
Makin
'
up
to
th
'
women
*NL*
folk
just
for
vanity
an
'
flightiness
.
There
's
nothin

he
would
n't
do
*NL*
for
th
'
sake
o
'
showin
'
off
an
'
flirtin
'
his
tail-feathers
.
He
's
as
*NL*
full
o
'
pride
as
an
egg
's
full
o
'
meat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
very
seldom
talked
much
and
sometimes
did
not
even
answer
Mary
's
*NL*
questions
except
by
a
grunt
,
but
this
morning
he
said
more
than
usual
.
*NL*
He
stood
up
and
rested
one
hobnailed
boot
on
the
top
of
his
spade
while
*NL*
he
looked
her
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
has
tha
'
been
here
?
''
he
jerked
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
's
about
a
month
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
's
beginnin
'
to
do
Misselthwaite
credit
,
''
he
said
.
``
Tha
's
a
bit
*NL*
fatter
than
tha
'
was
an
'
tha
's
not
quite
so
yeller

Tha
'
looked
like
a
*NL*
young
plucked
crow
when
tha
'
first
came
into
this
garden
.
Thinks
I
to
*NL*
myself
I
never
set
eyes
on
an
uglier
,
sourer
faced
young
`
un
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
not
vain
and
as
she
had
never
thought
much
of
her
looks
she
*NL*
was
not
greatly
disturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
I
'm
fatter
,
''
she
said
.
``
My
stockings
are
getting
tighter
.
*NL*
They
used
to
make
wrinkles
.
There
's
the
robin
,
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
indeed
,
was
the
robin
,
and
she
thought
he
looked
nicer
than
*NL*
ever
.
His
red
waistcoat
was
as
glossy
as
satin
and
he
flirted
his
*NL*
wings
and
tail
and
tilted
his
head
and
hopped
about
with
all
sorts
of
*NL*
lively
graces
.
He
seemed
determined
to
make
Ben
Weatherstaff
admire
*NL*
him
.
But
Ben
was
sarcastic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
there
tha
'
art
!
''
he
said
.
``
Tha

put

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

look
at
him
!
''
exclaimed
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
robin
was
evidently
in
a
fascinating
,
bold
mood
.
He
hopped
closer
*NL*
and
closer
and
looked
at
Ben
Weatherstaff
more
and
more
engagingly
.
He
*NL*
flew
on
to
the
nearest
currant
bush
and
tilted
his
head
and
sang
a
*NL*
little
song
right
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

tha
'll
get
over
me
by
doin
'
that
,
''
said
Ben
,
wrinkling
his
*NL*
face
up
in
such
a
way
that
Mary
felt
sure
he
was
trying
not
to
look
*NL*
pleased
.
``
Tha
'
thinks
no
one
can
stand
out
against
thee
--
that
's
what
*NL*
tha
'
thinks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
robin
spread
his
wings
--
Mary
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
.
He
*NL*
flew
right
up
to
the
handle
of
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
spade
and
alighted
on
*NL*
the
top
of
it
.
Then
the
old
man
's
face
wrinkled
itself
slowly
into
a
*NL*
new
expression
.
He
stood
still
as
if
he
were
afraid
to
breathe
--
as
if
*NL*
he
would
not
have
stirred
for
the
world
,
lest
his
robin
should
start
*NL*
away
.
He
spoke
quite
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
danged
!
''
he
said
as
softly
as
if
he
were
saying
something
*NL*
quite
different
.
``
Tha
'
does
know
how
to
get
at
a
chap
--
tha
'
does
!
*NL*
Tha
's
fair
unearthly
,
tha
's
so
knowin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
stood
without
stirring
--
almost
without
drawing
his
breath
--
until
*NL*
the
robin
gave
another
flirt
to
his
wings
and
flew
away
.
Then
he
stood
*NL*
looking
at
the
handle
of
the
spade
as
if
there
might
be
Magic
in
it
,
*NL*
and
then
he
began
to
dig
again
and
said
nothing
for
several
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
because
he
kept
breaking
into
a
slow
grin
now
and
then
,
Mary
was
*NL*
not
afraid
to
talk
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
a
garden
of
your
own
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
'm
bachelder
an
'
lodge
with
Martin
at
th
'
gate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
one
,
''
said
Mary
,
``
what
would
you
plant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cabbages
an
'
`
taters
an
'
onions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
wanted
to
make
a
flower
garden
,
''
persisted
Mary
,
``
what
*NL*
would
you
plant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bulbs
an
'
sweet-smellin
'
things
--
but
mostly
roses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
face
lighted
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
roses
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
rooted
up
a
weed
and
threw
it
aside
before
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
I
do
.
I
was
learned
that
by
a
young
lady
I
was
gardener
*NL*
to
.
She
had
a
lot
in
a
place
she
was
fond
of
,
an
'
she
loved
'em
like
*NL*
they
was
children
--
or
robins
.
I
've
seen
her
bend
over
an
'
kiss
'em
.
''
*NL*
He
dragged
out
another
weed
and
scowled
at
it
.
``
That
were
as
much
as
*NL*
ten
year
'
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
she
now
?
''
asked
Mary
,
much
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
,
''
he
answered
,
and
drove
his
spade
deep
into
the
soil
,
*NL*
''
`
cording
to
what
parson
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
happened
to
the
roses
?
''
Mary
asked
again
,
more
interested
than
*NL*
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
was
left
to
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
becoming
quite
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
they
quite
die
?
Do
roses
quite
die
when
they
are
left
to
*NL*
themselves
?
''
she
ventured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'd
got
to
like
'em
--
an
'
I
liked
her
--
an
'
she
liked
'em
,
''
Ben
*NL*
Weatherstaff
admitted
reluctantly
.
``
Once
or
twice
a
year
I
'd
go
an
'
*NL*
work
at
'em
a
bit
--
prune
'em
an
'
dig
about
th
'
roots
.
They
run
wild
,
*NL*
but
they
was
in
rich
soil
,
so
some
of
'em
lived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
they
have
no
leaves
and
look
gray
and
brown
and
dry
,
how
can
you
*NL*
tell
whether
they
are
dead
or
alive
?
''
inquired
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
till
th
'
spring
gets
at
'em
--
wait
till
th
'
sun
shines
on
th
'
rain
*NL*
and
th
'
rain
falls
on
th
'
sunshine
an
'
then
tha
'll
find
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
--
how
?
''
cried
Mary
,
forgetting
to
be
careful
.
``
Look
along
th
'
*NL*
twigs
an
'
branches
an
'
if
tha
'
see
a
bit
of
a
brown
lump
swelling
here
*NL*
an
'
there
,
watch
it
after
th
'
warm
rain
an
'
see
what
happens
.
''
He
*NL*
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
curiously
at
her
eager
face
.
``
Why
does
*NL*
tha
'
care
so
much
about
roses
an
'
such
,
all
of
a
sudden
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
felt
her
face
grow
red
.
She
was
almost
afraid
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
want
to
play
that
--
that
I
have
a
garden
of
my
own
,
''
she
*NL*
stammered
.
``
I
--
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
do
.
I
have
nothing
--
and
no
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Ben
Weatherstaff
slowly
,
as
he
watched
her
,
``
that
's
true
.
*NL*
Tha
'
has
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
in
such
an
odd
way
that
Mary
wondered
if
he
was
actually
a
*NL*
little
sorry
for
her
.
She
had
never
felt
sorry
for
herself
;
she
had
*NL*
only
felt
tired
and
cross
,
because
she
disliked
people
and
things
so
*NL*
much
.
But
now
the
world
seemed
to
be
changing
and
getting
nicer
.
If
*NL*
no
one
found
out
about
the
secret
garden
,
she
should
enjoy
herself
*NL*
always
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stayed
with
him
for
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
longer
and
asked
him
as
*NL*
many
questions
as
she
dared
.
He
answered
every
one
of
them
in
his
*NL*
queer
grunting
way
and
he
did
not
seem
really
cross
and
did
not
pick
up
*NL*
his
spade
and
leave
her
.
He
said
something
about
roses
just
as
she
was
*NL*
going
away
and
it
reminded
her
of
the
ones
he
had
said
he
had
been
fond
*NL*
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
go
and
see
those
other
roses
now
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
been
this
year
.
My
rheumatics
has
made
me
too
stiff
in
th
'
*NL*
joints
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
in
his
grumbling
voice
,
and
then
quite
suddenly
he
seemed
to
*NL*
get
angry
with
her
,
though
she
did
not
see
why
he
should
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
look
here
!
''
he
said
sharply
.
``
Do
n't
tha
'
ask
so
many
questions
.
*NL*
Tha
`
rt
th
'
worst
wench
for
askin
'
questions
I
've
ever
come
a
cross
.
*NL*
Get
thee
gone
an
'
play
thee
.
I
've
done
talkin
'
for
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
said
it
so
crossly
that
she
knew
there
was
not
the
least
use
in
*NL*
staying
another
minute
.
She
went
skipping
slowly
down
the
outside
*NL*
walk
,
thinking
him
over
and
saying
to
herself
that
,
queer
as
it
was
,
*NL*
here
was
another
person
whom
she
liked
in
spite
of
his
crossness
.
She
*NL*
liked
old
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
Yes
,
she
did
like
him
.
She
always
wanted
*NL*
to
try
to
make
him
talk
to
her
.
Also
she
began
to
believe
that
he
knew
*NL*
everything
in
the
world
about
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
laurel-hedged
walk
which
curved
round
the
secret
garden
and
*NL*
ended
at
a
gate
which
opened
into
a
wood
,
in
the
park
.
She
thought
she
*NL*
would
slip
round
this
walk
and
look
into
the
wood
and
see
if
there
were
*NL*
any
rabbits
hopping
about
.
She
enjoyed
the
skipping
very
much
and
when
*NL*
she
reached
the
little
gate
she
opened
it
and
went
through
because
she
*NL*
heard
a
low
,
peculiar
whistling
sound
and
wanted
to
find
out
what
it
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
strange
thing
indeed
.
She
quite
caught
her
breath
as
she
*NL*
stopped
to
look
at
it
.
A
boy
was
sitting
under
a
tree
,
with
his
back
*NL*
against
it
,
playing
on
a
rough
wooden
pipe
.
He
was
a
funny
looking
boy
*NL*
about
twelve
.
He
looked
very
clean
and
his
nose
turned
up
and
his
*NL*
cheeks
were
as
red
as
poppies
and
never
had
Mistress
Mary
seen
such
*NL*
round
and
such
blue
eyes
in
any
boy
's
face
.
And
on
the
trunk
of
the
*NL*
tree
he
leaned
against
,
a
brown
squirrel
was
clinging
and
watching
him
,
*NL*
and
from
behind
a
bush
nearby
a
cock
pheasant
was
delicately
stretching
*NL*
his
neck
to
peep
out
,
and
quite
near
him
were
two
rabbits
sitting
up
*NL*
and
sniffing
with
tremulous
noses
--
and
actually
it
appeared
as
if
they
*NL*
were
all
drawing
near
to
watch
him
and
listen
to
the
strange
low
little
*NL*
call
his
pipe
seemed
to
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
saw
Mary
he
held
up
his
hand
and
spoke
to
her
in
a
voice
almost
*NL*
as
low
as
and
rather
like
his
piping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tha
'
move
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
'd
flight
'em
.
''
Mary
remained
*NL*
motionless
.
He
stopped
playing
his
pipe
and
began
to
rise
from
the
*NL*
ground
.
He
moved
so
slowly
that
it
scarcely
seemed
as
though
he
were
*NL*
moving
at
all
,
but
at
last
he
stood
on
his
feet
and
then
the
squirrel
*NL*
scampered
back
up
into
the
branches
of
his
tree
,
the
pheasant
withdrew
*NL*
his
head
and
the
rabbits
dropped
on
all
fours
and
began
to
hop
away
,
*NL*
though
not
at
all
as
if
they
were
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
Dickon
,
''
the
boy
said
.
``
I
know
tha
`
rt
Miss
Mary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mary
realized
that
somehow
she
had
known
at
first
that
he
was
*NL*
Dickon
.
Who
else
could
have
been
charming
rabbits
and
pheasants
as
the
*NL*
natives
charm
snakes
in
India
?
He
had
a
wide
,
red
,
curving
mouth
and
*NL*
his
smile
spread
all
over
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
up
slow
,
''
he
explained
,
``
because
if
tha
'
makes
a
quick
move
it
*NL*
startles
'em
.
A
body
`
as
to
move
gentle
an
'
speak
low
when
wild
things
*NL*
is
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
speak
to
her
as
if
they
had
never
seen
each
other
before
but
*NL*
as
if
he
knew
her
quite
well
.
Mary
knew
nothing
about
boys
and
she
*NL*
spoke
to
him
a
little
stiffly
because
she
felt
rather
shy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
get
Martha
's
letter
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
his
curly
,
rust-colored
head
.
``
That
's
why
I
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stooped
to
pick
up
something
which
had
been
lying
on
the
ground
*NL*
beside
him
when
he
piped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
th
'
garden
tools
.
There
's
a
little
spade
an
'
rake
an
'
a
fork
*NL*
an
'
hoe
.
Eh
!
they
are
good
`
uns
.
There
's
a
trowel
,
too
.
An
'
th
'
woman
*NL*
in
th
'
shop
threw
in
a
packet
o
'
white
poppy
an
'
one
o
'
blue
larkspur
*NL*
when
I
bought
th
'
other
seeds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
show
the
seeds
to
me
?
''
Mary
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wished
she
could
talk
as
he
did
.
His
speech
was
so
quick
and
easy
.
*NL*
It
sounded
as
if
he
liked
her
and
was
not
the
least
afraid
she
would
*NL*
not
like
him
,
though
he
was
only
a
common
moor
boy
,
in
patched
clothes
*NL*
and
with
a
funny
face
and
a
rough
,
rusty-red
head
.
As
she
came
closer
*NL*
to
him
she
noticed
that
there
was
a
clean
fresh
scent
of
heather
and
*NL*
grass
and
leaves
about
him
,
almost
as
if
he
were
made
of
them
.
She
*NL*
liked
it
very
much
and
when
she
looked
into
his
funny
face
with
the
red
*NL*
cheeks
and
round
blue
eyes
she
forgot
that
she
had
felt
shy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
sit
down
on
this
log
and
look
at
them
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
and
he
took
a
clumsy
little
brown
paper
package
out
of
*NL*
his
coat
pocket
.
He
untied
the
string
and
inside
there
were
ever
so
*NL*
many
neater
and
smaller
packages
with
a
picture
of
a
flower
on
each
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
lot
o
'
mignonette
an
'
poppies
,
''
he
said
.
``
Mignonette
's
th
'
*NL*
sweetest
smellin
'
thing
as
grows
,
an
'
it
'll
grow
wherever
you
cast
it
,
*NL*
same
as
poppies
will
.
Them
as
'll
come
up
an
'
bloom
if
you
just
whistle
*NL*
to
'em
,
them
's
th
'
nicest
of
all
.
''
He
stopped
and
turned
his
head
*NL*
quickly
,
his
poppy-cheeked
face
lighting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
that
robin
as
is
callin
'
us
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chirp
came
from
a
thick
holly
bush
,
bright
with
scarlet
berries
,
*NL*
and
Mary
thought
she
knew
whose
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
really
calling
us
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
''
said
Dickon
,
as
if
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
,
*NL*
``
he
's
callin
'
some
one
he
's
friends
with

That
's
same
as
sayin

`
Here
*NL*
I
am

Look
at
me

I
wants
a
bit
of
a
chat

There
he
is
in
the
bush
.
*NL*
Whose
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
,
but
I
think
he
knows
me
a
little

''
answered
*NL*
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
he
knows
thee
,
''
said
Dickon
in
his
low
voice
again
.
``
An

likes
thee
.
He
's
took
thee
on
.
He
'll
tell
me
all
about
thee
in
a
*NL*
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
quite
close
to
the
bush
with
the
slow
movement
Mary
had
*NL*
noticed
before
,
and
then
he
made
a
sound
almost
like
the
robin
's
own
*NL*
twitter
.
The
robin
listened
a
few
seconds
,
intently
,
and
then
answered
*NL*
quite
as
if
he
were
replying
to
a
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
he
's
a
friend
o
'
yours
,
''
chuckled
Dickon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
is
?
''
cried
Mary
eagerly
.
She
did
so
want
to
know
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
really
likes
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
come
near
thee
if
he
did
n't
,
''
answered
Dickon
.
``
Birds
is
*NL*
rare
choosers
an
'
a
robin
can
flout
a
body
worse
than
a
man
.
See
,
he
's
*NL*
making
up
to
thee
now
.
`
Can
not
tha
'
see
a
chap
?
'
he
's
sayin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
really
seemed
as
if
it
must
be
true
.
He
so
sidled
and
twittered
*NL*
and
tilted
as
he
hopped
on
his
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
understand
everything
birds
say
?
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
's
grin
spread
until
he
seemed
all
wide
,
red
,
curving
mouth
,
and
*NL*
he
rubbed
his
rough
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
do
,
and
they
think
I
do
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
've
lived
on
th
'
moor
*NL*
with
'em
so
long
.
I
've
watched
'em
break
shell
an
'
come
out
an

fledge
*NL*
an
'
learn
to
fly
an

begin
to
sing
,
till
I
think
I
'm
one
of
'em

*NL*
Sometimes
I
think
p
`
raps
I
'm
a
bird
,
or
a
fox
,
or
a
rabbit
,
or
a
*NL*
squirrel

or
even
a
beetle
,
an

I
do
n't
know
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
and
came
back
to
the
log
and
began
to
talk
about
the
flower
*NL*
seeds
again
.
He
told
her
what
they
looked
like
when
they
were
flowers
;
*NL*
he
told
her
how
to
plant
them
,
and
watch
them
,
and
feed
and
water
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
,
''
he
said
suddenly
,
turning
round
to
look
at
her
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
plant
them
for
thee
myself
.
Where
is
tha
'
garden
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
thin
hands
clutched
each
other
as
they
lay
on
her
lap
.
She
did
*NL*
not
know
what
to
say
,
so
for
a
whole
minute
she
said
nothing
.
She
had
*NL*
never
thought
of
this
.
She
felt
miserable
.
And
she
felt
as
if
she
*NL*
went
red
and
then
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
's
got
a
bit
o
'
garden
,
has
n't
tha
'
?
''
Dickon
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
that
she
had
turned
red
and
then
pale
.
Dickon
saw
her
do
*NL*
it
,
and
as
she
still
said
nothing
,
he
began
to
be
puzzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
they
give
thee
a
bit
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Has
n't
tha
'
got
any
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
her
hands
tighter
and
turned
her
eyes
toward
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
boys
,
''
she
said
slowly
.
``
Could
you
keep
a
*NL*
secret
,
if
I
told
you
one
?
It
's
a
great
secret

I
do
n't
know
what
I
*NL*
should
do
if
any
one
found
it
out
.
I
believe
I
should
die
!
''
She
said
*NL*
the
last
sentence
quite
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
looked
more
puzzled
than
ever
and
even
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
*NL*
rough
head
again
,
but
he
answered
quite
good-humoredly
.
``
I
'm
keepin
'
*NL*
secrets
all
th
'
time
,
''
he
said
.
``
If
I

n't

moor

Aye
,
I
can
keep
*NL*
secrets

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
did
not
mean
to
put
out
her
hand
and
clutch
his
sleeve
*NL*
but
she
did
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
stolen
a
garden
,
''
she
said
very
fast
.
``
It
is
n't
mine

It
is
n't
*NL*
anybody

Nobody
wants
it

nobody

nobody

goes
into

it

Perhaps
everything
is
dead
in
it
already
.
I
do
n't
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
feel
hot
and
as
contrary
as
she
had
ever
felt
in
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
,
I
do
n't
care

Nobody
has
any
right
to
take
it
from
me
*NL*
when
I
care
about
it
and
they
do
n't
.
They
're
letting
it
die
,
all
shut
*NL*
in
by
itself
,
''
she
ended
passionately
,
and
she
threw
her
arms
over
her
*NL*
face
and
burst
out
crying-poor
little
Mistress
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
's
curious
blue
eyes
grew
rounder
and
rounder
.
``
Eh-h-h
!
''
he
*NL*
said
,
drawing
his
exclamation
out
slowly
,
and
the
way
he
did
it
meant
*NL*
both
wonder
and
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
nothing
to
do
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
Nothing
belongs
to
me
.
I
found
it
*NL*
myself
and
I
got
into
it
myself
.
I
was
only
just
like
the
robin
,
and
*NL*
they
would
n't
take
it
from
the
robin
.
''
``
Where
is
it
?
''
asked
Dickon
in
a
*NL*
dropped
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
got
up
from
the
log
at
once
.
She
knew
she
felt
contrary
*NL*
again
,
and
obstinate
,
and
she
did
not
care
at
all
.
She
was
imperious
*NL*
and
Indian
,
and
at
the
same
time
hot
and
sorrowful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
with
me
and
I
'll
show
you
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
led
him
round
the
laurel
path
and
to
the
walk
where
the
ivy
grew
so
*NL*
thickly
.
Dickon
followed
her
with
a
queer
,
almost
pitying
,
look
on
his
*NL*
face
.
He
felt
as
if
he
were
being
led
to
look
at
some
strange
bird
's
*NL*
nest
and
must
move
softly
.
When
she
stepped
to
the
wall
and
lifted
the
*NL*
hanging
ivy
he
started
.
There
was
a
door
and
Mary
pushed
it
slowly
*NL*
open
and
they
passed
in
together
,
and
then
Mary
stood
and
waved
her
*NL*
hand
round
defiantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
this
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
a
secret
garden
,
and
I
'm
the
only
one
in
*NL*
the
world
who
wants
it
to
be
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
looked
round
and
round
about
it
,
and
round
and
round
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
he
almost
whispered
,
``
it
is
a
queer
,
pretty
place
!
It
's
like
as
*NL*
if
a
body
was
in
a
dream

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
NEST
OF
THE
MISSEL
THRUSH
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
or
three
minutes
he
stood
looking
round
him
,
while
Mary
watched
*NL*
him
,
and
then
he
began
to
walk
about
softly
,
even
more
lightly
than
*NL*
Mary
had
walked
the
first
time
she
had
found
herself
inside
the
four
*NL*
walls
.
His
eyes
seemed
to
be
taking
in
everything
--
the
gray
trees
with
*NL*
the
gray
creepers
climbing
over
them
and
hanging
from
their
branches
,
*NL*
the
tangle
on
the
walls
and
among
the
grass
,
the
evergreen
alcoves
with
*NL*
the
stone
seats
and
tall
flower
urns
standing
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
thought
I
'd
see
this
place
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
know
about
it
?
''
asked
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
spoken
aloud
and
he
made
a
sign
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
talk
low
,
''
he
said
,
``
or
some
one
'll
hear
us
an
'
wonder
what
's
*NL*
to
do
in
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
forgot
!
''
said
Mary
,
feeling
frightened
and
putting
her
hand
*NL*
quickly
against
her
mouth
.
``
Did
you
know
about
the
garden
?
''
she
asked
*NL*
again
when
she
had
recovered
herself
.
Dickon
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Martha
told
me
there
was
one
as
no
one
ever
went
inside
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
``
Us
used
to
wonder
what
it
was
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
and
looked
round
at
the
lovely
gray
tangle
about
him
,
and
*NL*
his
round
eyes
looked
queerly
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
the
nests
as
'll
be
here
come
springtime
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
'd
be
th
'
*NL*
safest
nestin
'
place
in
England
.
No
one
never
comin
'
near
an
'
tangles
*NL*
o
'
trees
an
'
roses
to
build
in
.
I
wonder
all
th
'
birds
on
th
'
moor
*NL*
do
n't
build
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
again
without
knowing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
there
be
roses
?
''
she
whispered
.
``
Can
you
tell
?
I
thought
perhaps
*NL*
they
were
all
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
No
!
Not
them
--
not
all
of
'em
!
''
he
answered
.
``
Look
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
over
to
the
nearest
tree
--
an
old
,
old
one
with
gray
lichen
*NL*
all
over
its
bark
,
but
upholding
a
curtain
of
tangled
sprays
and
*NL*
branches
.
He
took
a
thick
knife
out
of
his
Pocket
and
opened
one
of
*NL*
its
blades
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
lots
o
'
dead
wood
as
ought
to
be
cut
out
,
''
he
said
.
``
An
'
*NL*
there
's
a
lot
o
'
old
wood
,
but
it
made
some
new
last
year
.
This
here
's
*NL*
a
new
bit
,
''
and
he
touched
a
shoot
which
looked
brownish
green
instead
*NL*
of
hard
,
dry
gray
.
Mary
touched
it
herself
in
an
eager
,
reverent
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
one
?
''
she
said
.
``
Is
that
one
quite
alive
quite
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
curved
his
wide
smiling
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
as
wick
as
you
or
me
,
''
he
said
;
and
Mary
remembered
that
Martha
*NL*
had
told
her
that
``
wick
''
meant
``
alive
''
or
``
lively
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
it
's
wick
!
''
she
cried
out
in
her
whisper
.
``
I
want
them
all
*NL*
to
be
wick
.
Let
us
go
round
the
garden
and
count
how
many
wick
ones
*NL*
there
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
quite
panted
with
eagerness
,
and
Dickon
was
as
eager
as
she
was
.
*NL*
They
went
from
tree
to
tree
and
from
bush
to
bush
.
Dickon
carried
his
*NL*
knife
in
his
hand
and
showed
her
things
which
she
thought
wonderful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
run
wild
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
th
'
strongest
ones
has
fair
thrived
*NL*
on
it
.
The
delicatest
ones
has
died
out
,
but
th
'
others
has
growed
an
'
*NL*
growed
,
an
'
spread
an
'
spread
,
till
they
's
a
wonder
.
See
here
!
''
and
he
*NL*
pulled
down
a
thick
gray
,
dry-looking
branch
.
``
A
body
might
think
this
*NL*
was
dead
wood
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
it
is
--
down
to
th
'
root
.
I
'll
cut
*NL*
it
low
down
an
'
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
knelt
and
with
his
knife
cut
the
lifeless-looking
branch
through
,
*NL*
not
far
above
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
he
said
exultantly
.
``
I
told
thee
so
.
There
's
green
in
that
*NL*
wood
yet
.
Look
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
down
on
her
knees
before
he
spoke
,
gazing
with
all
her
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
it
looks
a
bit
greenish
an
'
juicy
like
that
,
it
's
wick
,
''
he
*NL*
explained
.
``
When
th
'
inside
is
dry
an
'
breaks
easy
,
like
this
here
*NL*
piece
I
've
cut
off
,
it
's
done
for
.
There
's
a
big
root
here
as
all
this
*NL*
live
wood
sprung
out
of
,
an
'
if
th
'
old
wood
's
cut
off
an
'
it
's
dug
*NL*
round
,
and
took
care
of
there
'll
be
--
''
he
stopped
and
lifted
his
face
*NL*
to
look
up
at
the
climbing
and
hanging
sprays
above
him
--
``
there
'll
be
a
*NL*
fountain
o
'
roses
here
this
summer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
from
bush
to
bush
and
from
tree
to
tree
.
He
was
very
strong
*NL*
and
clever
with
his
knife
and
knew
how
to
cut
the
dry
and
dead
wood
*NL*
away
,
and
could
tell
when
an
unpromising
bough
or
twig
had
still
green
*NL*
life
in
it
.
In
the
course
of
half
an
hour
Mary
thought
she
could
tell
*NL*
too
,
and
when
he
cut
through
a
lifeless-looking
branch
she
would
cry
*NL*
out
joyfully
under
her
breath
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
least
shade
*NL*
of
moist
green
.
The
spade
,
and
hoe
,
and
fork
were
very
useful
.
He
*NL*
showed
her
how
to
use
the
fork
while
he
dug
about
roots
with
the
spade
*NL*
and
stirred
the
earth
and
let
the
air
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
working
industriously
round
one
of
the
biggest
standard
roses
*NL*
when
he
caught
sight
of
something
which
made
him
utter
an
exclamation
*NL*
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
''
he
cried
,
pointing
to
the
grass
a
few
feet
away
.
``
Who
did
that
*NL*
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
Mary
's
own
little
clearings
round
the

he
exclaimed

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

she
answered
,
``

they
were
so
little

the

was
so

thick

strong

they
looked
as
if
they
had
no

So
I
made
a

for
them

I
do

*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
went
and
knelt
down
by
them
,
smiling
his
wide
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha

was
right

he
said
.
``
A

from

*NL*
``
Tha

looking

her
over
.
*NL*
*NL*

I

said
Mary
,
``

I

his

gazing
at

wonderingly

She
had
never

*NL*

grinning

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
working
all
the
time
he
was
talking
and
Mary
was
following
him
*NL*
and
helping
him
with
her
fork
or
the
trowel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There

a

he

once

looking
about
quite
*NL*
exultantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will

come
again
and
help
me
to

Mary
begged

``
I

*NL*

stoutly

*NL*

she
ended
helplessly
.
What
could
you
*NL*
do
for
a

like
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

with

*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
walk
about
,
looking
up
in
the
trees
and
at
the
walls
and
*NL*
bushes
with
a
thoughtful
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
want

span

would
you

he
said
.
``
It

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

Mary
anxiously
.
``
It
would
n't
seem
*NL*
like

garden
if
it
was
tidy

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
stood
rubbing
his
rusty-red
head
with
a
rather
puzzled
look
.
*NL*
``
It
's
a
secret
garden
sure
enough
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
seems
like
some
one
*NL*
besides
th

have
been
in
it

it
was
shut
up
ten
year

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the

said
Mary

``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true

''
he
answered
.
``
It
's
a
queer
place

Seems
to
me
as
if
*NL*
there
'd
been
a

done

an

there

later

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
could
it
have
been
done
?
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
examining
a
branch
of
a
standard
rose
and
he
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
!
how
could
it
!
''
he
murmured
.
``
With
th

locked

'
th

*NL*
buried

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
always
felt
that
however
many
years
she
lived
she
should
*NL*
never
forget
that
first
morning
when
her
garden
began
to
grow
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
it
did
seem
to
begin
to
grow
for
her
that
morning
.
When
Dickon
*NL*
began
to
clear
places
to
plant
seeds
,
she
remembered
what
Basil
had
*NL*
sung
at
her
when
he
wanted
to
tease
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
any
flowers
that
look
like
bells
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lilies
o
'
th
'
valley
does
,
''
he
answered
,
digging
away
with
the
trowel
,
*NL*
``
an
'
there
's
Canterbury
bells
,
an
'
campanulas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
plant
some
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
There
's
lilies
o
'
th
,
valley
here
*NL*
already
;
I
saw
'em
.
They
'll
have
growed
too
close
an
'
we
'll
have
to
*NL*
separate
'em
,
but
there
's
plenty
.
Th
'
other
ones
takes
two
years
to
*NL*
bloom
from
seed
,
but
I
can
bring
you
some
bits
o
'
plants
from
our
*NL*
cottage
garden
.
Why
does
tha
'
want
'em
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mary
told
him
about
Basil
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
in
India
*NL*
and
of
how
she
had
hated
them
and
of
their
calling
her
``
Mistress
Mary
*NL*
Quite
Contrary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
used
to
dance
round
and
sing
at
me

They
sang
--
*NL*
*NL*

Mistress

quite
contrary

*NL*
How
does
your

grow

*NL*
With

shells

*NL*
And
marigolds
all
in

*NL*
*NL*
I
just
remembered
it
and
it
made
me
wonder
if
there
were
really
flowers
*NL*
like
silver
bells
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
frowned
a
little
and
gave
her
trowel
a
rather
spiteful
dig
into
the
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
n't
as
contrary
as
they
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dickon
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
he
said
,
and
as
he
crumbled
the
rich
black
soil
she
saw
he
was
*NL*
sniffing
up
the
scent
of
it
.
``
There
does
n't
seem
to
be
no
need
for
no
*NL*
one
to
be
contrary

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
,
kneeling
by
him
holding
the
seeds
,
looked
at
him
and
stopped
*NL*
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dickon
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
are
as
nice
as
Martha
said
you
were
.
I
like
*NL*
you
,
and
you
make
the
fifth
person
.
I
never
thought
I
should
like
five
*NL*
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
sat
up
on
his
heels
as
Martha
did
when
she
was
polishing
the
*NL*
grate
.
He
did
look
funny
and
delightful
,
Mary
thought
,
with
his
round
*NL*
blue
eyes
and
red
cheeks
and
happy
looking
turned-up
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
five
folk
as
tha

likes

''
he
said
.
``
Who
is
th
'
other
four
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
and
Martha
,
''
Mary
checked
them
off
on
her
fingers
,
``
and
*NL*
the
robin
and
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
laughed
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
stifle
the
sound
by
putting
*NL*
his
arm
over
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
tha
'
thinks
I
'm
a
queer
lad
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
I
think
tha
'
art
*NL*
th
'
queerest
little
lass
I
ever
saw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mary
did
a
strange
thing
.
She
leaned
forward
and
asked
him
a
*NL*
question
she
had
never
dreamed
of
asking
any
one
before
.
And
she
tried
*NL*
to
ask
it
in
Yorkshire
because
that
was
his
language
,
and
in
India
a
*NL*
native
was
always
pleased
if
you
knew
his
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
tha
'
like
me
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
he
answered
heartily
,
``
that
I
does
.
I
likes
thee
wonderful
,
an
'
*NL*
so
does
th
'
robin
,
I
do
believe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
two
,
then
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
That
's
two
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
they
began
to
work
harder
than
ever
and
more
joyfully
.
Mary
*NL*
was
startled
and
sorry
when
she
heard
the
big
clock
in
the
courtyard
*NL*
strike
the
hour
of
her
midday
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
to
go
,
''
she
said
mournfully
.
``
And
you
will
have
to
go
*NL*
too
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
grinned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dinner
's
easy
to
carry
about
with
me
,
''
he
said
.
``
Mother
always
*NL*
lets
me
put
a
bit
o
'
somethin'
in
my
pocket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
picked
up
his
coat
from
the
grass
and
brought
out
of
a
pocket
a
*NL*
lumpy
little
bundle
tied
up
in
a
quite
clean
,
coarse
,
blue
and
white
*NL*
handkerchief
.
It
held
two
thick
pieces
of
bread
with
a
slice
of
*NL*
something
laid
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
oftenest
naught
but
bread
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
I
've
got
a
fine
slice
*NL*
o
'
fat
bacon
with
it
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
thought
it
looked
a
queer
dinner
,
but
he
seemed
ready
to
enjoy
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
on
an
'
get
thy
victuals
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
be
done
with
mine
first
.
*NL*
I
'll
get
some
more
work
done
before
I
start
back
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
with
his
back
against
a
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
call
th
'
robin
up
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
give
him
th
'
rind
o
'
th
'
bacon
*NL*
to
peck
at
.
They
likes
a
bit
o
'
fat
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
could
scarcely
bear
to
leave
him
.
Suddenly
it
seemed
as
if
he
*NL*
might
be
a
sort
of
wood
fairy
who
might
be
gone
when
she
came
into
the
*NL*
garden
again
.
He
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
.
She
went
slowly
half-way
*NL*
to
the
door
in
the
wall
and
then
she
stopped
and
went
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
happens
,
you
--
you
never
would
tell
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
poppy-colored
cheeks
were
distended
with
his
first
big
bite
of
*NL*
bread
and
bacon
,
but
he
managed
to
smile
encouragingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
tha
'
was
a
missel
thrush
an

showed
me
where
thy
nest
was

Not

he
said
.
``
Tha

art
as
safe
as

thrush

*NL*
*NL*
And
she
was
quite
sure
she
was
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
``
MIGHT

HAVE
A

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
ran
so
fast
that
she
was
rather
out
of
breath
when
she
reached
her
*NL*
room
.
Her
hair
was
ruffled
on
her
forehead
and
her
cheeks
were
bright
*NL*
pink
.
Her
dinner
was
waiting
on
the
table
,
and
Martha
was
waiting
near
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha

a
bit
late

she
said
.
``
Where

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Mary

``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew

said
Martha
exultantly

``
How

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

I

said
Mary
in
a
determined
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
looked
rather
taken
aback
but
she
looked
pleased
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
,
``
he
's
th
'
best
lad
as
ever
was
born
,
but
us
never
*NL*
thought
he
was
handsome
.
His
nose
turns
up
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
it
to
turn
up
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
his
eyes
is
so
round
,
''
said
Martha
,
a
trifle
doubtful
.
``
Though
*NL*
they
're
a
nice
color
.
''
``
I
like
them
round

said
Mary
.
``
And
they
are
*NL*
exactly
the
color
of
the
sky
over
the
moor

*NL*
*NL*
Martha
beamed
with
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
says
he
made
'em
that
color
with
always
lookin

up
at
th
'
birds
*NL*
an
'
th
'
clouds
.
But
he
has
got
a
big
mouth
,
has
n't
he
,
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
his
big
mouth
,
''
said
Mary
obstinately
.
``
I
wish
mine
were
just
*NL*
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
chuckled
delightedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'd
look
rare
an
'
funny
in
thy
bit
of
a
face
,
''
she
said
.
``
But
I
*NL*
knowed
it
would
be
that
way
when

saw
him

How
did

like
th

*NL*
seeds
an

th

garden
tools
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
know
he
brought
them
?
''
asked
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
I
never
thought
of
him
not
bringin

'em

He
'd
be
sure
to
bring
'em

if
they
was
in
Yorkshire
.
He
's
such
a
trusty
lad

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
afraid
that
she
might
begin
to
ask
difficult
questions
,
but
*NL*
she
did
not
.
She
was
very
much
interested
in
the
seeds
and
gardening
*NL*
tools
,
and
there
was
only
one
moment
when
Mary
was
frightened
.
This
*NL*
was
when
she
began
to
ask
where
the
flowers
were
to
be
planted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
did
tha
'
ask
about
it
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
asked
anybody
yet
,
''
said
Mary
,
hesitating
.
``
Well
,
I
*NL*
would
n't
ask
th
'
head
gardener
.
He
's
too
grand
,
Mr.
Roach
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
seen
him
,

said
Mary
.
``
I
've
only
seen
undergardeners
and
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
was
you
,
I
'd
ask
Ben
Weatherstaff

advised
Martha
.
``
He
's
not
*NL*
half
as
bad
as
he
looks
,
for
all
he
's
so
crabbed

Mr.
Craven
lets
him
*NL*
do
what
he
likes
because
he
was
here
when
Mrs.
Craven
was
alive
,
an
'
he
*NL*
used
to
make
her
laugh
.
She
liked
him
.
Perhaps
he
'd
find
you
a
corner
*NL*
somewhere
out
o

the
way

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
was
out

no

no

my

having
it

could
they

Mary
said
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
would
n't
be
no
reason

answered
Martha
.
``
You
would
n't
do
no
*NL*
harm

*NL*
*NL*
Mary
ate
her
dinner
as
quickly
as
she
could
and
when
she
rose
from
the
*NL*
table
she
was
going
to
run
to
her
room
to
put
on
her
hat
again
,
but
*NL*
Martha
stopped
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
somethin'
to
tell
you
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
thought
I
'd
let
you
eat
*NL*
your
dinner
first

Mr.
Craven
came
back
this
mornin

and
I
think
he
*NL*
wants
to
see
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
turned
quite
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
said
.
``
Why
!
Why
!
He
did
n't
want
to
see
me
when
I
came
.
I
*NL*
heard
Pitcher
say
he
did
n't
.
''
``
Well
,
''
explained
Martha
,
``
Mrs.
Medlock
*NL*
says
it
's
because
o

mother

She
was
walkin

to
Thwaite
village
an
'
*NL*
she
met
him
.
She
'd
never
spoke
to
him
before
,
but
Mrs.
Craven
had
been
*NL*
to
our
cottage
two
or
three
times
.
He
'd
forgot
,
but
mother
had
n't
an

*NL*
she
made
bold
to
stop
him
.
I
do
n't
know
what
she
said
to
him
about
you
*NL*
but
she
said
somethin'
as
put
him
in
th
'
mind
to
see
you
before
he
goes
*NL*
away
again
,
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
cried
Mary
,
``
is
he
going
away
tomorrow
?
I
am
so
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
goin

for
a
long
time

He
may
n't
come
back
till
autumn
or
*NL*
winter

He
's
goin

to
travel
in
foreign
places

He
's
always
doin

it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
'm
so
glad
--
so
glad
!

said
Mary
thankfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
did
not
come
back
until
winter
,
or
even
autumn
,
there
would
be
*NL*
time
to
watch
the
secret
garden
come
alive
.
Even
if
he
found
out
then
*NL*
and
took
it
away
from
her
she
would
have
had
that
much
at
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
you
think
he
will
want
to
see

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
finish
the
sentence
,
because
the
door
opened
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Medlock
walked
in
.
She
had
on
her
best
black
dress
and
cap
,
and
her
*NL*
collar
was
fastened
with
a
large
brooch
with
a
picture
of
a
man
's
face
*NL*
on
it
.
It
was
a
colored
photograph
of
Mr.
Medlock
who
had
died
years
*NL*
ago
,
and
she
always
wore
it
when
she
was
dressed
up
.
She
looked
*NL*
nervous
and
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
hair
's
rough
,
''
she
said
quickly
.
``
Go
and
brush
it
.
Martha
,
help
*NL*
her
to
slip
on
her
best
dress
.
Mr.
Craven
sent
me
to
bring
her
to
him
*NL*
in
his
study
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
pink
left
Mary
's
cheeks
.
Her
heart
began
to
thump
and
she
felt
*NL*
herself
changing
into
a
stiff
,
plain
,
silent
child
again
.
She
did
not
*NL*
even
answer
Mrs.
Medlock
,
but
turned
and
walked
into
her
bedroom
,
*NL*
followed
by
Martha
.
She
said
nothing
while
her
dress
was
changed
,
and
*NL*
her
hair
brushed
,
and
after
she
was
quite
tidy
she
followed
Mrs.
*NL*
Medlock
down
the
corridors
,
in
silence
.
What
was
there
for
her
to
say
?
*NL*
She
was
obliged
to
go
and
see
Mr.
Craven
and
he
would
not
like
her
,
and
*NL*
she
would
not
like
him
.
She
knew
what
he
would
think
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
taken
to
a
part
of
the
house
she
had
not
been
into
before
.
At
*NL*
last
Mrs.
Medlock
knocked
at
a
door
,
and
when
some
one
said
,
``
Come
in
,
''
*NL*
they
entered
the
room
together
.
A
man
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
*NL*
before
the
fire
,
and
Mrs.
Medlock
spoke
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Miss
Mary
,
sir
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
go
and
leave
her
here
.
I
will
ring
for
you
when
I
want
you
to
*NL*
take
her
away
,
''
said
Mr.
Craven
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
went
out
and
closed
the
door
,
Mary
could
only
stand
waiting
,
a
*NL*
plain
little
thing
,
twisting
her
thin
hands
together
.
She
could
see
*NL*
that
the
man
in
the
chair
was
not
so
much
a
hunchback
as
a
man
with
*NL*
high
,
rather
crooked
shoulders
,
and
he
had
black
hair
streaked
with
*NL*
white
.
He
turned
his
head
over
his
high
shoulders
and
spoke
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
went
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
ugly
.
His
face
would
have
been
handsome
if
it
had
not
been
*NL*
so
miserable
.
He
looked
as
if
the
sight
of
her
worried
and
fretted
him
*NL*
and
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
in
the
world
to
do
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
well
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
they
take
good
care
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rubbed
his
forehead
fretfully
as
he
looked
her
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
thin
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
getting
fatter
,
''
Mary
answered
in
what
she
knew
was
her
stiffest
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
an
unhappy
face
he
had
!
His
black
eyes
seemed
as
if
they
scarcely
*NL*
saw
her
,
as
if
they
were
seeing
something
else
,
and
he
could
hardly
*NL*
keep
his
thoughts
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgot
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
How
could
I
remember
you
?
I
intended
to
send
*NL*
you
a
governess
or
a
nurse
,
or
some
one
of
that
sort
,
but
I
forgot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
''
began
Mary
.
``
Please
--
''
and
then
the
lump
in
her
throat
*NL*
choked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
to
say
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
--
I
am
too
big
for
a
nurse
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
And
please
--
please
do
n't
*NL*
make
me
have
a
governess
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rubbed
his
forehead
again
and
stared
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
what
the
Sowerby
woman
said
,
''
he
muttered
absentmindedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mary
gathered
a
scrap
of
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
--
is
she
Martha
's
mother
?
''
she
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
so
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
knows
about
children
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
She
has
twelve
.
She
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
rouse
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
play
out
of
doors
,
''
Mary
answered
,
hoping
that
her
voice
did
*NL*
not
tremble
.
``
I
never
liked
it
in
India
.
It
makes
me
hungry
here
,
and
*NL*
I
am
getting
fatter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
watching
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Sowerby
said
it
would
do
you
good
.
Perhaps
it
will
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
She
thought
you
had
better
get
stronger
before
you
had
a
governess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
makes
me
feel
strong
when
I
play
and
the
wind
comes
over
the
moor
,
''
*NL*
argued
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
play
?
''
he
asked
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everywhere
,
''
gasped
Mary
.
``
Martha
's
mother
sent
me
a
skipping-rope
.
I
*NL*
skip
and
run
--
and
I
look
about
to
see
if
things
are
beginning
to
stick
*NL*
up
out
of
the
earth
.
I
do
n't
do
any
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
look
so
frightened
,
''
he
said
in
a
worried
voice
.
``
You
could
not
*NL*
do
any
harm
,
a
child
like
you
!
You
may
do
what
you
like

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
put
her
hand
up
to
her
throat
because
she
was
afraid
he
might
see
*NL*
the
excited
lump
which
she
felt
jump
into
it
.
She
came
a
step
nearer
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
?
''
she
said
tremulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
anxious
little
face
seemed
to
worry
him
more
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
look
so
frightened
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Of
course
you
may
.
I
am
*NL*
your
guardian
,
though
I
am
a
poor
one
for
any
child

I
can
not
give
you
*NL*
time
or
attention
.
I
am
too
ill
,
and
wretched
and
distracted
;
but
I
*NL*
wish
you
to
be
happy
and
comfortable
.
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
*NL*
children
,
but
Mrs.
Medlock
is
to
see
that
you
have
all
you
need
.
I
*NL*
sent
for
you
to-day
because
Mrs.
Sowerby
said
I
ought
to
see
you
.
Her
*NL*
daughter
had
talked
about
you
.
She
thought
you
needed
fresh
air
and
*NL*
freedom
and
running
about
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
knows
all
about

Mary
said
again
in
spite
of
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ought
to
,

said
Mr.
Craven
.
``
I
thought
her
rather
bold
to
stop
me
*NL*
on
the
moor
,
but
she
said

Mrs.
Craven
had
been
kind
to
her
.

It
seemed
*NL*
hard
for
him
to
speak
his
dead
wife
's
name
.
``
She
is
a
respectable
*NL*
woman

Now
I
have
seen

sensible
things

out
*NL*
of
doors
as
much
as
you
like

It
's
a
big
place
and
you
may
go
where
*NL*
you
like
and
amuse
yourself
as
you
like

Is
there
anything
you
want
?

*NL*
as
if
a
sudden
thought
had
struck
him
.
``
Do
you
want
toys

books

*NL*
dolls

*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
I

quavered
Mary
,
``
might
I
have
a
bit
of
earth

*NL*
*NL*
In
her
eagerness
she
did
not
realize
how
queer
the
words
would
sound
*NL*
and
that
they
were
not
the
ones
she
had
meant
to
say

Mr.
Craven
*NL*
looked
quite
startled

*NL*
*NL*
``
Earth

he
repeated
.
``
What
do
you
mean

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
plant

alive

Mary
*NL*
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gazed
at
her
a
moment
and
then
passed
his
hand
quickly
over
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you

care
about
gardens
so
much

he
said
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did

said
Mary

tired
and
it
was
too
hot
.
I
sometimes
made
little
beds
in
the
sand
and
*NL*
stuck
flowers
in
them
.
But
here
it
is
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Craven
got
up
and
began
to
walk
slowly
across
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bit
of
earth
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
and
Mary
thought
that
somehow
she
*NL*
must
have
reminded
him
of
something
.
When
he
stopped
and
spoke
to
her
*NL*
his
dark
eyes
looked
almost
soft
and
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
have
as
much
earth
as
you
want
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
remind
me
of
*NL*
some
one
else
who
loved
the
earth
and
things
that
grow
.
When
you
see
a
*NL*
bit
of
earth
you
want
,
''
with
something
like
a
smile
,
``
take
it
,
child
,
*NL*
and
make
it
come
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
take
it
from
anywhere
--
if
it
's
not
wanted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anywhere
,
''
he
answered
.
``
There
!
You
must
go
now
,
I
am
tired
.
''
He
*NL*
touched
the
bell
to
call
Mrs.
Medlock
.
``
Good-by
.
I
shall
be
away
all
*NL*
summer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Medlock
came
so
quickly
that
Mary
thought
she
must
have
been
*NL*
waiting
in
the
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Medlock
,
''
Mr.
Craven
said
to
her
,
``
now
I
have
seen
the
child
I
*NL*
understand
what
Mrs.
Sowerby
meant
.
She
must
be
less
delicate
before
*NL*
she
begins
lessons
.
Give
her
simple
,
healthy
food
.
Let
her
run
wild
*NL*
in
the
garden
.
Do
n't
look
after
her
too
much
.
She
needs
liberty
and
*NL*
fresh
air
and
romping
about
.
Mrs.
Sowerby
is
to
come
and
see
her
now
*NL*
and
then
and
she
may
sometimes
go
to
the
cottage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Medlock
looked
pleased
.
She
was
relieved
to
hear
that
she
need
*NL*
not
``
look
after
''
Mary
too
much
.
She
had
felt
her
a
tiresome
charge
and
*NL*
had
indeed
seen
as
little
of
her
as
she
dared
.
In
addition
to
this
she
*NL*
was
fond
of
Martha
's
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
she
said
.
``
Susan
Sowerby
and
me
went
to
school
*NL*
together
and
she
's
as
sensible
and
good-hearted
a
woman
as
you
'd
find
*NL*
in
a
day
's
walk
.
I
never
had
any
children
myself
and
she
's
had
twelve
,
*NL*
and
there
never
was
healthier
or
better
ones
.
Miss
Mary
can
get
no
*NL*
harm
from
them
.
I
'd
always
take
Susan
Sowerby
's
advice
about
children
*NL*
myself
.
She
's
what
you
might
call
healthy-minded
--
if
you
understand
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
Mr.
Craven
answered
.
``
Take
Miss
Mary
away
now
and
send
*NL*
Pitcher
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Medlock
left
her
at
the
end
of
her
own
corridor
Mary
flew
*NL*
back
to
her
room
.
She
found
Martha
waiting
there
.
Martha
had
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
hurried
back
after
she
had
removed
the
dinner
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
have
my
garden
!
''
cried
Mary
.
``
I
may
have
it
where
I
like
!
I
am
*NL*
not
going
to
have
a
governess
for
a
long
time
!
Your
mother
is
coming
to
*NL*
see
me
and
I
may
go
to
your
cottage
!
He
says
a
little
girl
like
me
*NL*
could
not
do
any
harm
and
I
may
do
what
I
like
--
anywhere
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
said
Martha
delightedly
,
``
that
was
nice
of
him
was
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Martha
,
''
said
Mary
solemnly
,
``
he
is
really
a
nice
man
,
only
his
face
*NL*
is
so
miserable
and
his
forehead
is
all
drawn
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
as
quickly
as
she
could
to
the
garden
.
She
had
been
away
so
*NL*
much
longer
than
she
had
thought
she
should
and
she
knew
Dickon
would
*NL*
have
to
set
out
early
on
his
five-mile
walk
.
When
she
slipped
through
*NL*
the
door
under
the
ivy
,
she
saw
he
was
not
working
where
she
had
left
*NL*
him
.
The
gardening
tools
were
laid
together
under
a
tree
.
She
ran
to
*NL*
them
,
looking
all
round
the
place
,
but
there
was
no
Dickon
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
He
had
gone
away
and
the
secret
garden
was
empty
--
except
for
the
robin
*NL*
who
had
just
flown
across
the
wall
and
sat
on
a
standard
rose-bush
*NL*
watching
her
.
``
He
's
gone
,
''
she
said
woefully
.
``
Oh
!
was
he
--
was
*NL*
he
--
was
he
only
a
wood
fairy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
white
fastened
to
the
standard
rose-bush
caught
her
eye
.
It
*NL*
was
a
piece
of
paper
,
in
fact
,
it
was
a
piece
of
the
letter
she
had
*NL*
printed
for
Martha
to
send
to
Dickon
.
It
was
fastened
on
the
bush
with
*NL*
a
long
thorn
,
and
in
a
minute
she
knew
Dickon
had
left
it
there
.
There
*NL*
were
some
roughly
printed
letters
on
it
and
a
sort
of
picture
.
At
*NL*
first
she
could
not
tell
what
it
was
.
Then
she
saw
it
was
meant
for
a
*NL*
nest
with
a
bird
sitting
on
it
.
Underneath
were
the
printed
letters
*NL*
and
they
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
cum
bak
.
''
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
AM
COLIN
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
took
the
picture
back
to
the
house
when
she
went
to
her
supper
and
*NL*
she
showed
it
to
Martha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
said
Martha
with
great
pride
.
``
I
never
knew
our
Dickon
was
as
*NL*
clever
as
that
.
That
there
's
a
picture
of
a
missel
thrush
on
her
nest
,
*NL*
as
large
as
life
an
'
twice
as
natural
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mary
knew
Dickon
had
meant
the
picture
to
be
a
message
.
He
had
*NL*
meant
that
she
might
be
sure
he
would
keep
her
secret
.
Her
garden
was
*NL*
her
nest
and
she
was
like
a
missel
thrush
.
Oh
,
how
she
did
like
that
*NL*
queer
,
common
boy
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
hoped
he
would
come
back
the
very
next
day
and
she
fell
asleep
*NL*
looking
forward
to
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
you
never
know
what
the
weather
will
do
in
Yorkshire
,
particularly
*NL*
in
the
springtime
.
She
was
awakened
in
the
night
by
the
sound
of
rain
*NL*
beating
with
heavy
drops
against
her
window
.
It
was
pouring
down
in
*NL*
torrents
and
the
wind
was
``
wuthering
''
round
the
corners
and
in
the
*NL*
chimneys
of
the
huge
old
house
.
Mary
sat
up
in
bed
and
felt
miserable
*NL*
and
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rain
is
as
contrary
as
I
ever
was
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
came
because
it
*NL*
knew
I
did
not
want
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
threw
herself
back
on
her
pillow
and
buried
her
face
.
She
did
not
*NL*
cry
,
but
she
lay
and
hated
the
sound
of
the
heavily
beating
rain
,
she
*NL*
hated
the
wind
and
its
``
wuthering
.
''
She
could
not
go
to
sleep
again
.
*NL*
The
mournful
sound
kept
her
awake
because
she
felt
mournful
herself
.
*NL*
If
she
had
felt
happy
it
would
probably
have
lulled
her
to
sleep
.
How
*NL*
it
``
wuthered
''
and
how
the
big
raindrops
poured
down
and
beat
against
*NL*
the
pane
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
sounds
just
like
a
person
lost
on
the
moor
and
wandering
on
and
on
*NL*
crying
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
lying
awake
turning
from
side
to
side
for
about
an
hour
,
*NL*
when
suddenly
something
made
her
sit
up
in
bed
and
turn
her
head
toward
*NL*
the
door
listening
.
She
listened
and
she
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
the
wind
now
,
''
she
said
in
a
loud
whisper
.
``
That
is
n't
the
*NL*
wind
.
It
is
different
.
It
is
that
crying
I
heard
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
her
room
was
ajar
and
the
sound
came
down
the
corridor
,
a
*NL*
far-off
faint
sound
of
fretful
crying
.
She
listened
for
a
few
minutes
*NL*
and
each
minute
she
became
more
and
more
sure
.
She
felt
as
if
she
must
*NL*
find
out
what
it
was
.
It
seemed
even
stranger
than
the
secret
garden
*NL*
and
the
buried
key
.
Perhaps
the
fact
that
she
was
in
a
rebellious
mood
*NL*
made
her
bold
.
She
put
her
foot
out
of
bed
and
stood
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
find
out
what
it
is
,
''
she
said
.
``
Everybody
is
in
bed
*NL*
and
I
do
n't
care
about
Mrs.
Medlock
--
I
do
n't
care
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
candle
by
her
bedside
and
she
took
it
up
and
went
softly
*NL*
out
of
the
room
.
The
corridor
looked
very
long
and
dark
,
but
she
was
*NL*
too
excited
to
mind
that
.
She
thought
she
remembered
the
corners
she
*NL*
must
turn
to
find
the
short
corridor
with
the
door
covered
with
*NL*
tapestry
--
the
one
Mrs.
Medlock
had
come
through
the
day
she
lost
*NL*
herself
.
The
sound
had
come
up
that
passage
.
So
she
went
on
with
her
*NL*
dim
light
,
almost
feeling
her
way
,
her
heart
beating
so
loud
that
she
*NL*
fancied
she
could
hear
it
.
The
far-off
faint
crying
went
on
and
led
*NL*
her
.
Sometimes
it
stopped
for
a
moment
or
so
and
then
began
again
.
*NL*
Was
this
the
right
corner
to
turn
?
She
stopped
and
thought
.
Yes
it
*NL*
was
.
Down
this
passage
and
then
to
the
left
,
and
then
up
two
broad
*NL*
steps
,
and
then
to
the
right
again
.
Yes
,
there
was
the
tapestry
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
pushed
it
open
very
gently
and
closed
it
behind
her
,
and
she
stood
*NL*
in
the
corridor
and
could
hear
the
crying
quite
plainly
,
though
it
was
*NL*
not
loud
.
It
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
at
her
left
and
a
few
*NL*
yards
farther
on
there
was
a
door
.
She
could
see
a
glimmer
of
light
*NL*
coming
from
beneath
it
.
The
Someone
was
crying
in
that
room
,
and
it
*NL*
was
quite
a
young
Someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
walked
to
the
door
and
pushed
it
open
,
and
there
she
was
*NL*
standing
in
the
room
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
big
room
with
ancient
,
handsome
furniture
in
it
.
There
was
a
*NL*
low
fire
glowing
faintly
on
the
hearth
and
a
night
light
burning
by
the
*NL*
side
of
a
carved
four-posted
bed
hung
with
brocade
,
and
on
the
bed
was
*NL*
lying
a
boy
,
crying
fretfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
wondered
if
she
was
in
a
real
place
or
if
she
had
fallen
asleep
*NL*
again
and
was
dreaming
without
knowing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
had
a
sharp
,
delicate
face
the
color
of
ivory
and
he
seemed
to
*NL*
have
eyes
too
big
for
it
.
He
had
also
a
lot
of
hair
which
tumbled
over
*NL*
his
forehead
in
heavy
locks
and
made
his
thin
face
seem
smaller
.
He
*NL*
looked
like
a
boy
who
had
been
ill
,
but
he
was
crying
more
as
if
he
*NL*
were
tired
and
cross
than
as
if
he
were
in
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
stood
near
the
door
with
her
candle
in
her
hand
,
holding
her
*NL*
breath
.
Then
she
crept
across
the
room
,
and
,
as
she
drew
nearer
,
the
*NL*
light
attracted
the
boy
's
attention
and
he
turned
his
head
on
his
*NL*
pillow
and
stared
at
her
,
his
gray
eyes
opening
so
wide
that
they
*NL*
seemed
immense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
he
said
at
last
in
a
half-frightened
whisper
.
``
Are
you
*NL*
a
ghost
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
,
''
Mary
answered
,
her
own
whisper
sounding
half
*NL*
frightened
.
``
Are
you
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stared
and
stared
and
stared
.
Mary
could
not
help
noticing
what
*NL*
strange
eyes
he
had
.
They
were
agate
gray
and
they
looked
too
big
for
*NL*
his
face
because
they
had
black
lashes
all
round
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
replied
after
waiting
a
moment
or
so
.
``
I
am
Colin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
Colin
?
''
she
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
Colin
Craven
.
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
Mary
Lennox
.
Mr.
Craven
is
my
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
my
father
,
''
said
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
!
''
gasped
Mary
.
``
No
one
ever
told
me
he
had
a
boy
!
Why
*NL*
did
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
''
he
said
,
still
keeping
his
strange
eyes
fixed
on
her
with
*NL*
an
anxious
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
close
to
the
bed
and
he
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
real
,
are
n't
you
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
have
such
real
dreams
very
*NL*
often
.
You
might
be
one
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
slipped
on
a
woolen
wrapper
before
she
left
her
room
and
she
*NL*
put
a
piece
of
it
between
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rub
that
and
see
how
thick
and
warm
it
is
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
will
pinch
*NL*
you
a
little
if
you
like
,
to
show
you
how
real
I
am
.
For
a
minute
I
*NL*
thought
you
might
be
a
dream
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
come
from
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
my
own
room
.
The
wind
wuthered
so
I
could
n't
go
to
sleep
and
I
*NL*
heard
some
one
crying
and
wanted
to
find
out
who
it
was
.
What

crying
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

ached

*NL*
``
Mary
Lennox

Did
no

ever

you
I

come
to

here

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
fingering
the
fold
of
her
wrapper
,
but
he
began
to
look
a
*NL*
little
more
as
if
he
believed
in
her
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
.
``
They
dare
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
asked
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
should
have
been
afraid
you
would
see
me

I
wo
n't
let

people
see
me
and
talk
me
over

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
Mary
asked
again
,
feeling
more
mystified
every
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
am
like
this
always
,
ill
and
having
to
lie
down

My

wo
n't
let
people
talk
me
over
either

The
servants
are
not
allowed
to
*NL*
speak
about
me
.
If
I
live
I
may
be
a
hunchback
,
but
I
sha
n't
live

My
*NL*
father
hates
to
think
I
may
be
like
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
queer
house
this
is
!

Mary
said
.
``
What
a
queer
house
!
*NL*
Everything
is
a
kind
of
secret

Rooms
are
locked
up

locked
up

and
you
!
Have
you
been
locked
up
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
stay
in
this
room

I
do
n't
want

be
moved
out

*NL*
It
tires
me
too
much
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
your

come
and
see
you

Mary
ventured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes

Generally
when
I
am
asleep

He
does
n't
want
to
see
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
Mary
could
not
help
asking
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sort
of
angry
shadow
passed
over
the
boy
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
died
when
I
was
born
and
it
makes
him
wretched
to
look
at
*NL*
me
.
He
thinks
I
do
n't
know
,
but
I
've
heard
people
talking
.
He
almost
*NL*
hates
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
hates
the
garden
,
because
she
died

''
said
Mary
half
speaking
to
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
garden
?
''
the
boy
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
just
--
just
a
garden
she
used
to
like
,
''
Mary
stammered
.
``
Have
you
*NL*
been
here
always
?
''
``
Nearly
always
.
Sometimes
I
have
been
taken
to
*NL*
places
at
the
seaside
,
but
I
wo
n't
stay
because
people
stare
at
me
.
I
*NL*
used
to
wear
an
iron
thing
to
keep
my
back
straight
,
but
a
grand
doctor
*NL*
came
from
London
to
see
me
and
said
it
was
stupid
.
He
told
them
to
*NL*
take
it
off
and
keep
me
out
in
the
fresh
air
.
I
hate
fresh
air
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
go
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
when
first
I
came
here
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
Why
do
you
keep
looking
*NL*
at
me
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
of
the
dreams
that
are
so
real
,
''
he
answered
rather
fretfully
.
*NL*
``
Sometimes
when
I
open
my
eyes
I
do
n't
believe
I
'm
awake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
both
awake
,
''
said
Mary
.
She
glanced
round
the
room
with
its
*NL*
high
ceiling
and
shadowy
corners
and
dim
fire-light
.
``
It
looks
quite
*NL*
like
a
dream
,
and
it
's
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
everybody
in
the
*NL*
house
is
asleep
--
everybody
but
us
.
We
are
wide
awake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
it
to
be
a
dream
,
''
the
boy
said
restlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
thought
of
something
all
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
like
people
to
see
you
,
''
she
began
,
``
do
you
want
me
to
go
*NL*
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
held
the
fold
of
her
wrapper
and
he
gave
it
a
little
pull
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
should
be
sure
you
were
a
dream
if
you
went
.
If
you
*NL*
are
real
,
sit
down
on
that
big
footstool
and
talk
.
I
want
to
hear
*NL*
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
put
down
her
candle
on
the
table
near
the
bed
and
sat
down
on
the
*NL*
cushioned
stool
.
She
did
not
want
to
go
away
at
all
.
She
wanted
to
*NL*
stay
in
the
mysterious
hidden-away
room
and
talk
to
the
mysterious
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
know
how
long
she
had
been
at
Misselthwaite
;
he
wanted
to
*NL*
know
which
corridor
her
room
was
on
;
he
wanted
to
know
what
she
had
*NL*
been
doing
;
if
she
disliked
the
moor
as
he
disliked
it
;
where
she
had
*NL*
lived
before
she
came
to
Yorkshire
.
She
answered
all
these
questions
*NL*
and
many
more
and
he
lay
back
on
his
pillow
and
listened
.
He
made
her
*NL*
tell
him
a
great
deal
about
India
and
about
her
voyage
across
the
*NL*
ocean
.
She
found
out
that
because
he
had
been
an
invalid
he
had
not
*NL*
learned
things
as
other
children
had
.
One
of
his
nurses
had
taught
him
*NL*
to
read
when
he
was
quite
little
and
he
was
always
reading
and
looking
*NL*
at
pictures
in
splendid
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
his
father
rarely
saw
him
when
he
was
awake
,
he
was
given
all
*NL*
sorts
of
wonderful
things
to
amuse
himself
with
.
He
never
seemed
to
*NL*
have
been
amused
,
however
.
He
could
have
anything
he
asked
for
and
was
*NL*
never
made
to
do
anything
he
did
not
like
to
do
.
``
Everyone
is
obliged
*NL*
to
do
what
pleases
me
,
''
he
said
indifferently
.
``
It
makes
me
ill
to
be
*NL*
angry
.
No
one
believes
I
shall
live
to
grow
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
as
if
he
was
so
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
it
had
ceased
to
*NL*
matter
to
him
at
all
.
He
seemed
to
like
the
sound
of
Mary
's
voice
.
As
*NL*
she
went
on
talking
he
listened
in
a
drowsy
,
interested
way
.
Once
or
*NL*
twice
she
wondered
if
he
were
not
gradually
falling
into
a
doze
.
But
*NL*
at
last
he
asked
a
question
which
opened
up
a
new
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
are
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ten
,
''
answered
Mary
,
forgetting
herself
for
the
moment
,
``
and
so
*NL*
are
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
that
?
''
he
demanded
in
a
surprised
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
when
you
were
born
the
garden
door
was
locked
and
the
key
was
*NL*
buried
.
And
it
has
been
locked
for
ten
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
half
sat
up
,
turning
toward
her
,
leaning
on
his
elbows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
garden
door
was
locked
?
Who
did
it
?
Where
was
the
key
buried
?
''
he
*NL*
exclaimed
as
if
he
were
suddenly
very
much
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
--
it
was
the
garden
Mr.
Craven
hates
,
''
said
Mary
nervously
.
``
He
*NL*
locked
the
door
.
No
one
--
no
one
knew
where
he
buried
the
key
.
''
``
What
*NL*
sort
of
a
garden
is
it
?
''
Colin
persisted
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
has
been
allowed
to
go
into
it
for
ten
years
,
''
was
Mary
's
*NL*
careful
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
too
late
to
be
careful
.
He
was
too
much
like
herself
.
He
*NL*
too
had
had
nothing
to
think
about
and
the
idea
of
a
hidden
garden
*NL*
attracted
him
as
it
had
attracted
her
.
He
asked
question
after
*NL*
question
.
Where
was
it
?
Had
she
never
looked
for
the
door
?
Had
she
*NL*
never
asked
the
gardeners
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
talk
about
it
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
think
they
have
been
told
*NL*
not
to
answer
questions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
make
them
,
''
said
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
?
''
Mary
faltered
,
beginning
to
feel
frightened
.
If
he
could
*NL*
make
people
answer
questions
,
who
knew
what
might
happen
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everyone
is
obliged
to
please
me
.
I
told
you
that
,
''
he
said
.
``
If
I
*NL*
were
to
live
,
this
place
would
sometime
belong
to
me
.
They
all
know
*NL*
that
.
I
would
make
them
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
not
known
that
she
herself
had
been
spoiled
,
but
she
could
see
*NL*
quite
plainly
that
this
mysterious
boy
had
been
.
He
thought
that
the
*NL*
whole
world
belonged
to
him
.
How
peculiar
he
was
and
how
coolly
he
*NL*
spoke
of
not
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
you
wo
n't
live
?
''
she
asked
,
partly
because
she
was
*NL*
curious
and
partly
in
hope
of
making
him
forget
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
suppose
I
shall
,
''
he
answered
as
indifferently
as
he
had
*NL*
spoken
before
.
``
Ever
since
I
remember
anything
I
have
heard
people
say
*NL*
I
sha
n't
.
At
first
they
thought
I
was
too
little
to
understand
and
now
*NL*
they
think
I
do
n't
hear
.
But
I
do
.
My
doctor
is
my
father
's
cousin
.
*NL*
He
is
quite
poor
and
if
I
die
he
will
have
all
Misselthwaite
when
my
*NL*
father
is
dead
.
I
should
think
he
would
n't
want
me
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
live
?
''
inquired
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
,
in
a
cross
,
tired
fashion
.
``
But
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
die
.
When
I
feel
ill
I
lie
here
and
think
about
it
until
I
cry
and
*NL*
cry
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
you
crying
three
times
,

Mary
said
,
``
but
I
did
not
know
*NL*
who
it
was
.
Were
you
crying
about
that
?
''
She
did
so
want
him
to
forget
*NL*
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
,
''
he
answered
.
``
Let
us
talk
about
something
else
.
Talk
*NL*
about
that
garden
.
Do
n't
you
want
to
see
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Mary
,
in
quite
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
he
went
on
persistently
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
really
wanted
*NL*
to
see
anything
before

but
I
want
to
see
that
garden
.
I
want
the
key
*NL*
dug
up
.
I
want
the
door
unlocked
.
I
would
let
them
take
me
there
in
*NL*
my
chair
.
That
would
be
getting
fresh
air
.
I
am
going
to
make
them
*NL*
open
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
become
quite
excited
and
his
strange
eyes
began
to
shine
like
*NL*
stars
and
looked
more
immense
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
to
please
me
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
will
make
them
take
me
there
and
*NL*
I
will
let
you
go
,
too

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
hands
clutched
each
other
.
Everything
would
be
*NL*
spoiled
--
everything
!
Dickon
would
never
come
back
.
She
would
never
*NL*
again
feel
like
a
missel
thrush
with
a
safe-hidden
nest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
--
do
n't
--
do
n't

do
n't
do
that

she
cried
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stared
as
if
he
thought
she
had
gone
crazy
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?

he
exclaimed
.
``
You
said
you
wanted
to
see
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

she
answered
almost
with
a
sob
in
her
throat
,
``
but
if
you
make
*NL*
them
open
the
door
and
take
you
in
like

never

*NL*
again

*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
still
farther
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
secret

he
said
.
``
What
do
you
mean

Tell
me

*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
words
almost
tumbled
over
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see

you
see

she
panted
,
``

no

there
was

we

find
it

slip
through

together

shut
it
*NL*
behind

no

knew

inside

we
called

garden

pretended
that

thrushes

nest

played
there
almost
every

dug

planted

come
alive

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is

dead

interrupted
her
.

*NL*
``
It
soon
will
be

she
went
on

stopped
her
again
as
excited
as
she
was
herself

What
are
bulbs

he
put
in
quickly

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
daffodils

green
points

watch
the
things
grow
bigger
every
day
,
and
see
how
many
roses
are
*NL*
alive
.
Do
n't
you
see
?
Oh
,
do
n't
you
see
how
much
nicer
it
would
be
*NL*
if
it
was
a
secret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
back
on
his
pillow
and
lay
there
with
an
odd
expression
on
*NL*
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
had
a
secret
,
''
he
said
,
``
except
that
one
about
not
living
to
*NL*
grow
up
.
They
do
n't
know
I
know
that
,
so
it
is
a
sort
of
secret
.
But
*NL*
I
like
this
kind
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
wo
n't
make
them
take
you
to
the
garden
,
''
pleaded
Mary
,
*NL*
``
perhaps
--
I
feel
almost
sure
I
can
find
out
how
to
get
in
sometime
.
*NL*
And
then
--
if
the
doctor
wants
you
to
go
out
in
your
chair
,
and
if
you
*NL*
can
always
do
what
you
want
to
do
,
perhaps
--
perhaps
we
might
find
some
*NL*
boy
who
would
push
you
,
and
we
could
go
alone
and
it
would
always
be
a
*NL*
secret
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
--
like
--
that
,
''
he
said
very
slowly
,
his
eyes
looking
dreamy
.
*NL*
``
I
should
like
that
.
I
should
not
mind
fresh
air
in
a
secret
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
began
to
recover
her
breath
and
feel
safer
because
the
idea
of
*NL*
keeping
the
secret
seemed
to
please
him
.
She
felt
almost
sure
that
if
*NL*
she
kept
on
talking
and
could
make
him
see
the
garden
in
his
mind
as
*NL*
she
had
seen
it
he
would
like
it
so
much
that
he
could
not
bear
to
*NL*
think
that
everybody
might
tramp
in
to
it
when
they
chose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
think
it
would
be
like
,
if
we
could
go
into
it
,
''
*NL*
she
said
.
``
It
has
been
shut
up
so
long
things
have
grown
into
a
tangle
*NL*
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
quite
still
and
listened
while
she
went
on
talking
about
the
*NL*
roses
which
might
have
clambered
from
tree
to
tree
and
hung
down
--
about
*NL*
the
many
birds
which
might
have
built
their
nests
there
because
it
was
*NL*
so
safe
.
And
then
she
told
him
about
the
robin
and
Ben
Weatherstaff
,
*NL*
and
there
was
so
much
to
tell
about
the
robin
and
it
was
so
easy
and
*NL*
safe
to
talk
about
it
that
she
ceased
to
be
afraid
.
The
robin
pleased
*NL*
him
so
much
that
he
smiled
until
he
looked
almost
beautiful
,
and
at
*NL*
first
Mary
had
thought
that
he
was
even
plainer
than
herself
,
with
his
*NL*
big
eyes
and
heavy
locks
of
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
birds
could
be
like
that
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
if
you
stay
*NL*
in
a
room
you
never
see
things
.
What
a
lot
of
things
you
know
.
I
feel
*NL*
as
if
you
had
been
inside
that
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
know
what
to
say
,
so
she
did
not
say
anything
.
He
*NL*
evidently
did
not
expect
an
answer
and
the
next
moment
he
gave
her
a
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
let
you
look
at
something
,
''
he
said
.
``
Do
you
see
that
*NL*
rose-colored
silk
curtain
hanging
on
the
wall
over
the
mantel-piece
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
not
noticed
it
before
,
but
she
looked
up
and
saw
it
.
It
was
a
*NL*
curtain
of
soft
silk
hanging
over
what
seemed
to
be
some
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
cord
hanging
from
it
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
Go
and
pull
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
got
up
,
much
mystified
,
and
found
the
cord
.
When
she
pulled
it
*NL*
the
silk
curtain
ran
back
on
rings
and
when
it
ran
back
it
uncovered
a
*NL*
picture
.
It
was
the
picture
of
a
girl
with
a
laughing
face
.
She
had
*NL*
bright
hair
tied
up
with
a
blue
ribbon
and
her
gay
,
lovely
eyes
were
*NL*
exactly
like
Colin
's
unhappy
ones
,
agate
gray
and
looking
twice
as
big
*NL*
as
they
really
were
because
of
the
black
lashes
all
round
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
my
mother
,
''
said
Colin
complainingly
.
``
I
do
n't
see
why
she
*NL*
died
.
Sometimes
I
hate
her
for
doing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
queer
!
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
had
lived
I
believe
I
should
not
have
been
ill
always
,
''
he
*NL*
grumbled
.
``
I
dare
say
I
should
have
lived
,
too
.
And
my
father
would
*NL*
not
have
hated
to
look
at
me
.
I
dare
say
I
should
have
had
a
strong
*NL*
back
.
Draw
the
curtain
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
did
as
she
was
told
and
returned
to
her
footstool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
much
prettier
than
you
,
''
she
said
,
``
but
her
eyes
are
just
like
*NL*
yours
--
at
least
they
are
the
same
shape
and
color
.
Why
is
the
curtain
*NL*
drawn
over
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
uncomfortably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
made
them
do
it
,
''
he
said
.
``
Sometimes
I
do
n't
like
to
see
her
*NL*
looking
at
me
.
She
smiles
too
much
when
I
am
ill
and
miserable
.
*NL*
Besides
,
she
is
mine
and
I
do
n't
want
everyone
to
see
her
.
''
There
were
*NL*
a
few
moments
of
silence
and
then
Mary
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
Mrs.
Medlock
do
if
she
found
out
that
I
had
been
here
?
''
she
*NL*
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
do
as
I
told
her
to
do
,
''
he
answered
.
``
And
I
should
tell
*NL*
her
that
I
wanted
you
to
come
here
and
talk
to
me
every
day
.
I
am
glad
*NL*
you
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
will
come
as
often
as
I
can
,
but
''
--
she
*NL*
hesitated
--
``
I
shall
have
to
look
every
day
for
the
garden
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
must
,
''
said
Colin
,
``
and
you
can
tell
me
about
it
afterward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
thinking
a
few
minutes
,
as
he
had
done
before
,
and
then
he
spoke
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
shall
be
a
secret
,
too
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
will
not
tell
them
*NL*
until
they
find
out
.
I
can
always
send
the
nurse
out
of
the
room
and
*NL*
say
that
I
want
to
be
by
myself
.
Do
you
know
Martha
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
her
very
well
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
She
waits
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
his
head
toward
the
outer
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
the
one
who
is
asleep
in
the
other
room
.
The
nurse
went
away
*NL*
yesterday
to
stay
all
night
with
her
sister
and
she
always
makes
Martha
*NL*
attend
to
me
when
she
wants
to
go
out
.
Martha
shall
tell
you
when
to
*NL*
come
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mary
understood
Martha
's
troubled
look
when
she
had
asked
*NL*
questions
about
the
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Martha
knew
about
you
all
the
time
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
she
often
attends
to
me
.
The
nurse
likes
to
get
away
from
me
and
*NL*
then
Martha
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
here
a
long
time
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
Shall
I
go
away
now
?
Your
*NL*
eyes
look
sleepy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
go
to
sleep
before
you
leave
me
,
''
he
said
rather
shyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
your
eyes
,
''
said
Mary
,
drawing
her
footstool
closer
,
``
and
I
will
*NL*
do
what
my
Ayah
used
to
do
in
India
.
I
will
pat
your
hand
and
stroke
*NL*
it
and
sing
something
quite
low
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
that
perhaps
,
''
he
said
drowsily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somehow
she
was
sorry
for
him
and
did
not
want
him
to
lie
awake
,
so
she
*NL*
leaned
against
the
bed
and
began
to
stroke
and
pat
his
hand
and
sing
a
*NL*
very
low
little
chanting
song
in
Hindustani
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
nice
,
''
he
said
more
drowsily
still
,
and
she
went
on
chanting
*NL*
and
stroking
,
but
when
she
looked
at
him
again
his
black
lashes
were
*NL*
lying
close
against
his
cheeks
,
for
his
eyes
were
shut
and
he
was
fast
*NL*
asleep
.
So
she
got
up
softly
,
took
her
candle
and
crept
away
without
*NL*
making
a
sound
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
A
YOUNG
RAJAH
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
moor
was
hidden
in
mist
when
the
morning
came
,
and
the
rain
had
not
*NL*
stopped
pouring
down
.
There
could
be
no
going
out
of
doors
.
Martha
*NL*
was
so
busy
that
Mary
had
no
opportunity
of
talking
to
her
,
but
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
she
asked
her
to
come
and
sit
with
her
in
the
nursery
.
She
*NL*
came
bringing
the
stocking
she
was
always
knitting
when
she
was
doing
*NL*
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
thee
?
''
she
asked
as
soon
as
they
sat
down
.
*NL*
``
Tha
'
looks
as
if
tha
'd
somethin'
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
.
I
have
found
out
what
the
crying
was
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
let
her
knitting
drop
on
her
knee
and
gazed
at
her
with
startled
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
has
n't
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
Never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
it
in
the
night
,
''
Mary
went
on
.
``
And
I
got
up
and
went
to
see
*NL*
where
it
came
from
.
It
was
Colin
.
I
found
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
's
face
became
red
with
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
Miss
Mary
!
''
she
said
half
crying
.
``
Tha
'
should
n't
have
done
*NL*
it

tha
'
should
n't
!
Tha
'll

trouble

I
never
told
thee

nothin

about

'll

me
in

lose
my
place

what
'll
mother
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
lose
your
place

''
said
Mary
.
``
He
was
glad
I
came

We
*NL*
talked
and
talked
and
he
said
he
was
glad
I
came

*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
he
?

cried
Martha
.
``
Art
tha
'
sure
?
Tha
'
does
n't
know
what
he
's
*NL*
like
when
anything
vexes
him
.
He
's
a
big
lad
to
cry
like
a
baby
,
but
*NL*
when
he
's
in
a
passion
he
'll
fair
scream
just
to
frighten
us

He
knows

our
souls
our

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
n't
vexed

said
Mary
.
``
I
asked
him
if
I
should
go
away
and
he
*NL*
made
me
stay
.
He
asked
me
questions
and
I
sat
on
a
big
footstool
and
*NL*
talked
to
him
about
India
and
about
the
robin
and
gardens
.
He
would
n't
*NL*
let
me
go
.
He
let
me
see
his
mother
's
picture

Before
I
left
him
I
*NL*
sang
him
to
sleep

*NL*
*NL*
Martha
fairly
gasped
with
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
scarcely
believe
thee

she
protested
.
``
It

Mary

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

what
to

cried
agitated
Martha
.
``
If
Mrs.
Medlock
*NL*
finds
out

*NL*

Mary
firmly

``

true

Martha

wiping
her

forehead
with
her
apron

*NL*
``

Mary
argued

*NL*
``

cried
Martha
with
wide
open
eyes

Mary

*NL*
``

Martha

drawing
a
long

breath

*NL*
``
Do

Magic

inquired
Mary

I

heard
about
Magic

I

I
just
went
into
his
room

I
was
so
surprised

to
see

I
stood
and
stared

And
then

turned
round

a
ghost
or
a
dream
and
I
thought
perhaps
he
*NL*
was
.
And
it
was
so
queer
being
there
alone
together
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
night
and
not
knowing
about
each
other
.
And
we
began
to
ask
each
*NL*
other
questions
.
And
when
I
asked
him
if
I
must
go
away
he
said
I
must
*NL*
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Th

world

comin

to

gasped
Martha

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
him
?

asked
Mary

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
knows
for
sure
and
certain

said
Martha

``
Mr.
Craven
went
off
*NL*
his
head
like
when
he
was
born
.
Th
'
doctors
thought
he
'd
have
to
be
*NL*
put
in
a
`
sylum
.
It
was
because
Mrs.
Craven
died
like
I
told
you
.
He
*NL*
would
n't
set
eyes
on
th
'
baby
.
He
just
raved
and
said
it
'd
be
another
*NL*
hunchback
like
him
and
it
'd
better
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Colin
a
hunchback
?

Mary
asked
.
``
He
did
n't
look
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
n't
yet

said
Martha
.
``
But
he
began
all
wrong

Mother
said
*NL*
that
there
was
enough
trouble
and
raging
in
th
'
house
to
set
any
child
*NL*
wrong
.
They
was
afraid
his
back
was
weak
an

they

always
been

takin

it

keepin

him
lyin

down

not

him
walk

*NL*
Once
they
made
him
wear
a
brace
but
he
fretted
so
he
was
downright
ill
.
*NL*
Then
a
big
doctor
came
to
see
him
an

made
them
take
it
off
.
He
talked
*NL*
to
th

other
doctor
quite
rough

in
a
polite
way
.
He
said
there

been
*NL*
too
much
medicine

too
much
lettin

him
have
his
own
way

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

he
's
a

spoiled

Mary

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
th

worst

Martha

``
I
wo
n't
say
as
*NL*
he
has

He

had
coughs
an

colds
that

nearly
*NL*
killed
him
two
or
three
times
.
Once
he
had
rheumatic
fever
an

once
he
*NL*
had
typhoid

Eh

Mrs.

did
get
a

He

She

*NL*
Mary
sat
and
looked
at
the
fire

I

she

slowly

It

me
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
One

Martha

one

a

curious

into

he
said
he

looked
at
him
because
he
was
going

*NL*
be

He
cried

into

*NL*

If

*NL*
*NL*
Very
soon
afterward
a
bell
rang
and
she
rolled
up
her
knitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
th

nurse
wants
me
to
stay
with

a

she
said

I
*NL*
hope

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
out
of
the
room
about
ten
minutes
and
then
she
came
back
with
a
*NL*
puzzled
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

tha

has
bewitched
him

He
's
up

six
o'clock

Th

minute
she

he
called

says
,

I
want

You

better
go
as
quick

you

*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
quite
willing
to
go
quickly
.
She
did
not
want
to
see
Colin
as
*NL*
much
as
she
wanted
to
see
Dickon
;
but
she
wanted
to
see
him
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
bright
fire
on
the
hearth
when
she
entered
his
room
,
and
in
*NL*
the
daylight
she
saw
it
was
a
very
beautiful
room
indeed
.
There
were
*NL*
rich
colors
in
the
rugs
and
hangings
and
pictures
and
books
on
the
*NL*
walls
which
made
it
look
glowing
and
comfortable
even
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
gray
sky
and
falling
rain
.
Colin
looked
rather
like
a
picture
himself
.
*NL*
He
was
wrapped
in
a
velvet
dressing-gown
and
sat
against
a
big
brocaded
*NL*
cushion
.
He
had
a
red
spot
on
each
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
've
been
thinking
about
you
all
morning

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
thinking
about
you
,
too
,
''
answered
Mary
.
``
You
do
n't
know
*NL*
how
frightened
Martha
is
.
She
says
Mrs.
Medlock
will
think
she
told
me
*NL*
about
you
and
then
she
will
be
sent
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
tell
her
to
come
here

he
said

``
She
is
in

*NL*
*NL*
Mary
went
and
brought
her
back
.
Poor
Martha
was
shaking
in
her
shoes
.
*NL*
Colin
was
still
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
to
do
what
I
please
or
have
you
not
?

he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
to
do
what
you
please

Martha
faltered
,
turning
quite
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Medlock
to
do
what
I
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
has

sir

said
Martha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
if
I
order
you
to
bring
Miss
Mary
to
me
,
how
can
Medlock
*NL*
send
you
away
if
she
finds
it
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
let
her
,
sir

''
pleaded
Martha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
send
her
away
if
she
dares
to
say
a
word
about
such
a
thing
,

*NL*
said
Master
Craven
grandly
.
``
She
would
n't
like
that
,
I
can
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir

''
bobbing
a
curtsy
,
``
I
want
to
do
my
duty
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
want
is
your
duty

said
Colin
more
grandly
still
.
``
I
'll
take
*NL*
care
of
you
.
Now
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
door
closed
behind
Martha
,
Colin
found
Mistress
Mary
gazing
at
*NL*
him
as
if
he
had
set
her
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
?
''
he
asked
her
.
``
What
are
you
*NL*
thinking
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thinking
about
two
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
they
?
Sit
down
and
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
first
one
,
''
said
Mary
,
seating
herself
on
the
big
stool
.
*NL*
``
Once
in
India
I
saw
a
boy
who
was
a
Rajah
.
He
had
rubies
and
emeralds
*NL*
and
diamonds
stuck
all
over
him
.
He
spoke
to
his
people
just
as
you
*NL*
spoke
to
Martha
.
Everybody
had
to
do
everything
he
told
them
--
in
a
*NL*
minute
.
I
think
they
would
have
been
killed
if
they
had
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
make
you
tell
me
about
Rajahs
presently
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
first
*NL*
tell
me
what
the
second
thing
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
,
''
said
Mary
,
``
how
different
you
are
from
Dickon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
Dickon
?
''
he
said
.
``
What
a
queer
name
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
might
as
well
tell
him
,
she
thought
she
could
talk
about
Dickon
*NL*
without
mentioning
the
secret
garden
.
She
had
liked
to
hear
Martha
*NL*
talk
about
him
.
Besides
,
she
longed
to
talk
about
him
.
It
would
seem
*NL*
to
bring
him
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
Martha
's
brother
.
He
is
twelve
years
old
,
''
she
explained
.
``
He
*NL*
is
not
like
any
one
else
in
the
world
.
He
can
charm
foxes
and
*NL*
squirrels
and
birds
just
as
the
natives
in
India
charm
snakes
.
He
*NL*
plays
a
very
soft
tune
on
a
pipe
and
they
come
and
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
big
books
on
a
table
at
his
side
and
he
dragged
one
*NL*
suddenly
toward
him
.
``
There
is
a
picture
of
a
snake-charmer
in
this
,
''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
.
``
Come
and
look
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
book
was
a
beautiful
one
with
superb
colored
illustrations
and
he
*NL*
turned
to
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
he
do
that
?
''
he
asked
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
played
on
his
pipe
and
they
listened
,

Mary
explained
.
``
But
he
*NL*
does
n't
call
it
Magic

He
says
it
's
because
he
lives
on
the
moor
so
*NL*
much
and
he
knows
their
ways

He
says
he
feels
sometimes
as
if
he
was
*NL*
a
bird
or
a
rabbit
himself
,
he
likes
them
so
.
I
think
he
asked
the
*NL*
robin
questions

It
seemed
as
if
they
talked
to
each
other
in
soft
*NL*
chirps

''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
lay
back
on
his
cushion
and
his
eyes
grew
larger
and
larger
and
*NL*
the
spots
on
his
cheeks
burned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
some
more
about
him

he
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knows
all
about
eggs

nests

Mary
went
on

``
And
he
knows
where

foxes

badgers

live

He
keeps
them
secret
so
that
other

boys
wo
n't
find
their
holes
and
frighten
them

He
knows
about

everything
that
grows

lives
on
the
moor

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
like
the
moor

said
Colin
.
``
How
can
he
when
it
's
such
a
*NL*
great
,
bare
,
dreary
place
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
most
beautiful
place

protested
Mary
.
``
Thousands
of
lovely
*NL*
things
grow
on
it

there
are
thousands
of
little
creatures
all
busy
*NL*
building
nests
and
making
holes
and
burrows
and
chippering
or
singing
*NL*
or
squeaking
to
each
other
.
They
are
so
busy
and
having
such
fun
under
*NL*
the
earth
or
in
the
trees
or
heather
.
It
's
their
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
all
that
?
''
said
Colin
,
turning
on
his
elbow
to
look
at
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
been
there
once

really

said
Mary
suddenly
remembering
.
*NL*
``
I
only
drove
over
it
in
the
dark
.
I
thought
it
was
hideous

Martha
*NL*
told
me
about
it
first
and
then
Dickon
.
When
Dickon
talks
about
it
you
*NL*
feel
as
if
you
saw
things
and
heard
them
and
as
if
you
were
standing
in
*NL*
the
heather
with
the
sun
shining
and
the
gorse
smelling
like
honey
--
and
*NL*
all
full
of
bees
and
butterflies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
see
anything
if
you
are
ill
,
''
said
Colin
restlessly
.
He
*NL*
looked
like
a
person
listening
to
a
new
sound
in
the
distance
and
*NL*
wondering
what
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
if
you
stay
in
a
room

said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
go
on
the
moor

he
said
in
a
resentful
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
silent
for
a
minute
and
then
she
said
something
bold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
--
sometime

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
as
if
he
were
startled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
the
moor

How
could
I
?
I
am
going
to
die

``
How
do

know

*NL*
said
Mary
unsympathetically
.
She
did
n't
like
the
way
he
had
of
talking
*NL*
about
dying
.
She
did
not
feel
very
sympathetic

She
felt
rather
as
if
*NL*
he
almost
boasted
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
heard
it
ever
since
I
remember
,
''
he
answered
crossly
.
``
They
*NL*
are
always
whispering
about
it
and
thinking
I
do
n't
notice
.
They
wish
*NL*
I
would
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
felt
quite
contrary
.
She
pinched
her
lips
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
wished
I
would
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
would
n't
.
Who
wishes
you
would
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
servants
--
and
of
course
Dr.
Craven
because
he
would
get
*NL*
Misselthwaite
and
be
rich
instead
of
poor
.
He
dare
n't
say
so
,
but
he
*NL*
always
looks
cheerful
when
I
am
worse
.
When
I
had
typhoid
fever
his
*NL*
face
got
quite
fat
.
I
think
my
father
wishes
it
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
he
does
,
''
said
Mary
quite
obstinately
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
made
Colin
turn
and
look
at
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
lay
back
on
his
cushion
and
was
still
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
thinking
.
And
there
was
quite
a
long
silence
.
Perhaps
they
were
both
*NL*
of
them
thinking
strange
things
children
do
not
usually
think
.
``
I
like
*NL*
the
grand
doctor
from
London
,
because
he
made
them
take
the
iron
thing
*NL*
off
,
''
said
Mary
at
last
``
Did
he
say
you
were
going
to
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
n't
whisper
,
''
Colin
answered
.
``
Perhaps
he
knew
I
hated
*NL*
whispering
.
I
heard
him
say
one
thing
quite
aloud
.
He
said
,
`
The
lad
*NL*
might
live
if
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
it
.
Put
him
in
the
humor
.
'
*NL*
It
sounded
as
if
he
was
in
a
temper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
who
would
put
you
in
the
humor
,
perhaps
,
''
said
Mary
*NL*
reflecting
.
She
felt
as
if
she
would
like
this
thing
to
be
settled
one
*NL*
way
or
the
other
.
``
I
believe
Dickon
would
.
He
's
always
talking
about
*NL*
live
things
.
He
never
talks
about
dead
things
or
things
that
are
ill
.
*NL*
He
's
always
looking
up
in
the
sky
to
watch
birds
flying
--
or
looking
*NL*
down
at
the
earth
to
see
something
growing
.
He
has
such
round
blue
*NL*
eyes
and
they
are
so
wide
open
with
looking
about
.
And
he
laughs
such
*NL*
a
big
laugh
with
his
wide
mouth
--
and
his
cheeks
are
as
red
--
as
red
as
*NL*
cherries
.
''
She
pulled
her
stool
nearer
to
the
sofa
and
her
expression
*NL*
quite
changed
at
the
remembrance
of
the
wide
curving
mouth
and
wide
*NL*
open
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
,
''
she
said
.
``
Do
n't
let
us
talk
about
dying
;
I
do
n't
like
it
.
*NL*
Let
us
talk
about
living
.
Let
us
talk
and
talk
about
Dickon
.
And
then
*NL*
we
will
look
at
your
pictures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
best
thing
she
could
have
said
.
To
talk
about
Dickon
meant
*NL*
to
talk
about
the
moor
and
about
the
cottage
and
the
fourteen
people
*NL*
who
lived
in
it
on
sixteen
shillings
a
week
--
and
the
children
who
got
*NL*
fat
on
the
moor
grass
like
the
wild
ponies
.
And
about
Dickon
's
*NL*
mother
--
and
the
skipping-rope
--
and
the
moor
with
the
sun
on
it
--
and
*NL*
about
pale
green
points
sticking
up
out
of
the
black
sod
.
And
it
was
*NL*
all
so
alive
that
Mary
talked
more
than
she
had
ever
talked
before
--
and
*NL*
Colin
both
talked
and
listened
as
he
had
never
done
either
before
.
And
*NL*
they
both
began
to
laugh
over
nothings
as
children
will
when
they
are
*NL*
happy
together
.
And
they
laughed
so
that
in
the
end
they
were
making
*NL*
as
much
noise
as
if
they
had
been
two
ordinary
healthy
natural
*NL*
ten-year-old
creatures
--
instead
of
a
hard
,
little
,
unloving
girl
and
a
*NL*
sickly
boy
who
believed
that
he
was
going
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
enjoyed
themselves
so
much
that
they
forgot
the
pictures
and
they
*NL*
forgot
about
the
time
.
They
had
been
laughing
quite
loudly
over
Ben
*NL*
Weatherstaff
and
his
robin
,
and
Colin
was
actually
sitting
up
as
if
he
*NL*
had
forgotten
about
his
weak
back
,
when
he
suddenly
remembered
*NL*
something
.
``
Do
you
know
there
is
one
thing
we
have
never
once
thought
*NL*
of
,
''
he
said
.
``
We
are
cousins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
so
queer
that
they
had
talked
so
much
and
never
remembered
*NL*
this
simple
thing
that
they
laughed
more
than
ever
,
because
they
had
*NL*
got
into
the
humor
to
laugh
at
anything
.
And
in
the
midst
of
the
fun
*NL*
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
Dr.
Craven
and
Mrs.
Medlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Craven
started
in
actual
alarm
and
Mrs.
Medlock
almost
fell
back
*NL*
because
he
had
accidentally
bumped
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
''
exclaimed
poor
Mrs.
Medlock
with
her
eyes
almost
starting
*NL*
out
of
her
head
.
``
Good
Lord
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
?
''
said
Dr.
Craven
,
coming
forward
.
``
What
does
it
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mary
was
reminded
of
the
boy
Rajah
again
.
Colin
answered
as
if
*NL*
neither
the
doctor
's
alarm
nor
Mrs.
Medlock
's
terror
were
of
the
*NL*
slightest
consequence
.
He
was
as
little
disturbed
or
frightened
as
if
*NL*
an
elderly
cat
and
dog
had
walked
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
cousin
,
Mary
Lennox
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
asked
her
to
come
and
*NL*
talk
to
me
.
I
like
her
.
She
must
come
and
talk
to
me
whenever
I
send
*NL*
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Craven
turned
reproachfully
to
Mrs.
Medlock
.
``
Oh
,
sir
''
she
panted
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
it
's
happened
.
There
's
not
a
servant
on
the
place
*NL*
tha
'd
dare
to
talk
--
they
all
have
their
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
told
her
anything
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
She
heard
me
crying
and
found
*NL*
me
herself
.
I
am
glad
she
came
.
Do
n't
be
silly
,
Medlock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
saw
that
Dr.
Craven
did
not
look
pleased
,
but
it
was
quite
plain
*NL*
that
he
dare
not
oppose
his
patient
.
He
sat
down
by
Colin
and
felt
his
*NL*
pulse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
there
has
been
too
much
excitement
.
Excitement
is
not
*NL*
good
for
you
,
my
boy
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
excited
if
she
kept
away
,
''
answered
Colin
,
his
eyes
*NL*
beginning
to
look
dangerously
sparkling
.
``
I
am
better
.
She
makes
me
*NL*
better
.
The
nurse
must
bring
up
her
tea
with
mine
.
We
will
have
tea
*NL*
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Medlock
and
Dr.
Craven
looked
at
each
other
in
a
troubled
way
,
but
*NL*
there
was
evidently
nothing
to
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
look
rather
better
,
sir
,
''
ventured
Mrs.
Medlock
.
*NL*
``
But
''
--
thinking
the
matter
over
--
``
he
looked
better
this
morning
before
*NL*
she
came
into
the
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
came
into
the
room
last
night
.
She
stayed
with
me
a
long
time
.
*NL*
She
sang
a
Hindustani
song
to
me
and
it
made
me
go
to
sleep
,
''
said
*NL*
Colin
.
``
I
was
better
when
I
wakened
up
.
I
wanted
my
breakfast
.
I
*NL*
want
my
tea
now
.
Tell
nurse
,
Medlock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Craven
did
not
stay
very
long
.
He
talked
to
the
nurse
for
a
few
*NL*
minutes
when
she
came
into
the
room
and
said
a
few
words
of
warning
to
*NL*
Colin
.
He
must
not
talk
too
much
;
he
must
not
forget
that
he
was
ill
;
*NL*
he
must
not
forget
that
he
was
very
easily
tired
.
Mary
thought
that
*NL*
there
seemed
to
be
a
number
of
uncomfortable
things
he
was
not
to
*NL*
forget
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
looked
fretful
and
kept
his
strange
black-lashed
eyes
fixed
on
*NL*
Dr.
Craven
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
forget
it
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
She
makes
me
forget
it
.
That
*NL*
is
why
I
want
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Craven
did
not
look
happy
when
he
left
the
room
.
He
gave
a
puzzled
*NL*
glance
at
the
little
girl
sitting
on
the
large
stool
.
She
had
become
a
*NL*
stiff
,
silent
child
again
as
soon
as
he
entered
and
he
could
not
see
*NL*
what
the
attraction
was
.
The
boy
actually
did
look
brighter
,
*NL*
however
--
and
he
sighed
rather
heavily
as
he
went
down
the
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
always
wanting
me
to
eat
things
when
I
do
n't
want
to
,
''
said
*NL*
Colin
,
as
the
nurse
brought
in
the
tea
and
put
it
on
the
table
by
the
*NL*
sofa
.
``
Now
,
if
you
'll
eat
I
will
.
Those
muffins
look
so
nice
and
hot

*NL*
Tell
me
about
Rajahs

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
NEST
BUILDING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
another
week
of
rain
the
high
arch
of
blue
sky
appeared
again
and
*NL*
the
sun
which
poured
down
was
quite
hot
.
Though
there
had
been
no
*NL*
chance
to
see
either
the
secret
garden
or
Dickon
,
Mistress
Mary
had
*NL*
enjoyed
herself
very
much
.
The
week
had
not
seemed
long
.
She
had
*NL*
spent
hours
of
every
day
with
Colin
in
his
room
,
talking
about
Rajahs
*NL*
or
gardens
or
Dickon
and
the
cottage
on
the
moor
.
They
had
looked
at
*NL*
the
splendid
books
and
pictures
and
sometimes
Mary
had
read
things
to
*NL*
Colin
,
and
sometimes
he
had
read
a
little
to
her
.
When
he
was
amused
*NL*
and
interested
she
thought
he
scarcely
looked
like
an
invalid
at
all
,
*NL*
except
that
his
face
was
so
colorless
and
he
was
always
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
sly
young
one
to
listen
and
get
out
of
your
bed
to
go
*NL*
following
things
up
like
you
did
that
night
,
''
Mrs.
Medlock
said
once
.
*NL*
``
But
there
's
no
saying
it
's
not
been
a
sort
of
blessing
to
the
lot
of
*NL*
us
.
He
's
not
had
a
tantrum
or
a
whining
fit
since
you
made
friends
.
*NL*
The
nurse
was
just
going
to
give
up
the
case
because
she
was
so
sick
of
*NL*
him
,
but
she
says
she
does
n't
mind
staying
now
you
've
gone
on
duty
with
*NL*
her
,
''
laughing
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
talks
with
Colin
,
Mary
had
tried
to
be
very
cautious
about
the
*NL*
secret
garden
.
There
were
certain
things
she
wanted
to
find
out
from
*NL*
him
,
but
she
felt
that
she
must
find
them
out
without
asking
him
direct
*NL*
questions
.
In
the
first
place
,
as
she
began
to
like
to
be
with
him
,
*NL*
she
wanted
to
discover
whether
he
was
the
kind
of
boy
you
could
tell
a
*NL*
secret
to
.
He
was
not
in
the
least
like
Dickon
,
but
he
was
evidently
*NL*
so
pleased
with
the
idea
of
a
garden
no
one
knew
anything
about
that
*NL*
she
thought
perhaps
he
could
be
trusted
.
But
she
had
not
known
him
*NL*
long
enough
to
be
sure
.
The
second
thing
she
wanted
to
find
out
was
*NL*
this
:
If
he
could
be
trusted
--
if
he
really
could
--
would
n't
it
be
*NL*
possible
to
take
him
to
the
garden
without
having
any
one
find
it
out
?
*NL*
The
grand
doctor
had
said
that
he
must
have
fresh
air
and
Colin
had
*NL*
said
that
he
would
not
mind
fresh
air
in
a
secret
garden
.
Perhaps
if
*NL*
he
had
a
great
deal
of
fresh
air
and
knew
Dickon
and
the
robin
and
saw
*NL*
things
growing
he
might
not
think
so
much
about
dying
.
Mary
had
seen
*NL*
herself
in
the
glass
sometimes
lately
when
she
had
realized
that
she
*NL*
looked
quite
a
different
creature
from
the
child
she
had
seen
when
she
*NL*
arrived
from
India
.
This
child
looked
nicer
.
Even
Martha
had
seen
a
*NL*
change
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Th
'
air
from
th
'
moor
has
done
thee
good
already
,
''
she
had
said
.
*NL*
``
Tha
`
rt
not
nigh
so
yeller
and
tha
`
rt
not
nigh
so
scrawny
.
Even
tha
'
*NL*
hair
does
n't
slamp
down
on
tha
'
head
so
flat
.
It
's
got
some
life
in
it
*NL*
so
as
it
sticks
out
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
like
me
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
It
's
growing
stronger
and
fatter
.
I
'm
*NL*
sure
there
's
more
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
it
,
for
sure
,
''
said
Martha
,
ruffling
it
up
a
little
round
her
*NL*
face
.
``
Tha
`
rt
not
half
so
ugly
when
it
's
that
way
an
'
there
's
a
bit
o
'
*NL*
red
in
tha
'
cheeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
gardens
and
fresh
air
had
been
good
for
her
perhaps
they
would
be
*NL*
good
for
Colin
.
But
then
,
if
he
hated
people
to
look
at
him
,
perhaps
*NL*
he
would
not
like
to
see
Dickon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
it
make
you
angry
when
you
are
looked
at
?
''
she
inquired
one
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
hated
it
,
''
he
answered
,
``
even
when
I
was
very
little
.
Then
*NL*
when
they
took
me
to
the
seaside
and
I
used
to
lie
in
my
carriage
*NL*
everybody
used
to
stare
and
ladies
would
stop
and
talk
to
my
nurse
and
*NL*
then
they
would
begin
to
whisper
and
I
knew
then
they
were
saying
I
*NL*
should
n't
live
to
grow
up
.
Then
sometimes
the
ladies
would
pat
my
*NL*
cheeks
and
say
`
Poor
child
!
'
Once
when
a
lady
did
that
I
screamed
out
*NL*
loud
and
bit
her
hand
.
She
was
so
frightened
she
ran
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
thought
you
had
gone
mad
like
a
dog
,
''
said
Mary
,
not
at
all
*NL*
admiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
what
she
thought
,
''
said
Colin
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
why
you
did
n't
scream
and
bite
me
when
I
came
into
your
*NL*
room
?
''
said
Mary
.
Then
she
began
to
smile
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
a
ghost
or
a
dream
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
ca
n't
bite
a
*NL*
ghost
or
a
dream
,
and
if
you
scream
they
do
n't
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
hate
it
if
--
if
a
boy
looked
at
you
?
''
Mary
asked
uncertainly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
back
on
his
cushion
and
paused
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
boy
,
''
he
said
quite
slowly
,
as
if
he
were
thinking
over
*NL*
every
word
,
``
there
's
one
boy
I
believe
I
should
n't
mind
.
It
's
that
boy
*NL*
who
knows
where
the
foxes
live
--
Dickon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
would
n't
mind
him
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
birds
do
n't
and
other
animals
,
''
he
said
,
still
thinking
it
over
,
*NL*
``
perhaps
that
's
why
I
should
n't
.
He
's
a
sort
of
animal
charmer
and
I
am
*NL*
a
boy
animal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
laughed
and
she
laughed
too
;
in
fact
it
ended
in
their
both
*NL*
laughing
a
great
deal
and
finding
the
idea
of
a
boy
animal
hiding
in
*NL*
his
hole
very
funny
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Mary
felt
afterward
was
that
she
need
not
fear
about
Dickon
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
first
morning
when
the
sky
was
blue
again
Mary
wakened
very
*NL*
early
.
The
sun
was
pouring
in
slanting
rays
through
the
blinds
and
*NL*
there
was
something
so
joyous
in
the
sight
of
it
that
she
jumped
out
of
*NL*
bed
and
ran
to
the
window
.
She
drew
up
the
blinds
and
opened
the
*NL*
window
itself
and
a
great
waft
of
fresh
,
scented
air
blew
in
upon
her
.
*NL*
The
moor
was
blue
and
the
whole
world
looked
as
if
something
Magic
had
*NL*
happened
to
it
.
There
were
tender
little
fluting
sounds
here
and
there
*NL*
and
everywhere
,
as
if
scores
of
birds
were
beginning
to
tune
up
for
a
*NL*
concert
.
Mary
put
her
hand
out
of
the
window
and
held
it
in
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
warm
--
warm
!
''
she
said
.
``
It
will
make
the
green
points
push
up
*NL*
and
up
and
up
,
and
it
will
make
the
bulbs
and
roots
work
and
struggle
*NL*
with
all
their
might
under
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
kneeled
down
and
leaned
out
of
the
window
as
far
as
she
could
,
*NL*
breathing
big
breaths
and
sniffing
the
air
until
she
laughed
because
*NL*
she
remembered
what
Dickon
's
mother
had
said
about
the
end
of
his
nose
*NL*
quivering
like
a
rabbit
's
.
``
It
must
be
very
early
,
''
she
said
.
``
The
*NL*
little
clouds
are
all
pink
and
I
've
never
seen
the
sky
look
like
this
.
*NL*
No
one
is
up
.
I
do
n't
even
hear
the
stable
boys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
thought
made
her
scramble
to
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
wait
!
I
am
going
to
see
the
garden
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
learned
to
dress
herself
by
this
time
and
she
put
on
her
*NL*
clothes
in
five
minutes
.
She
knew
a
small
side
door
which
she
could
*NL*
unbolt
herself
and
she
flew
downstairs
in
her
stocking
feet
and
put
on
*NL*
her
shoes
in
the
hall
.
She
unchained
and
unbolted
and
unlocked
and
*NL*
when
the
door
was
open
she
sprang
across
the
step
with
one
bound
,
and
*NL*
there
she
was
standing
on
the
grass
,
which
seemed
to
have
turned
green
,
*NL*
and
with
the
sun
pouring
down
on
her
and
warm
sweet
wafts
about
her
and
*NL*
the
fluting
and
twittering
and
singing
coming
from
every
bush
and
tree
.
*NL*
She
clasped
her
hands
for
pure
joy
and
looked
up
in
the
sky
and
it
was
*NL*
so
blue
and
pink
and
pearly
and
white
and
flooded
with
springtime
light
*NL*
that
she
felt
as
if
she
must
flute
and
sing
aloud
herself
and
knew
that
*NL*
thrushes
and
robins
and
skylarks
could
not
possibly
help
it
.
She
ran
*NL*
around
the
shrubs
and
paths
towards
the
secret
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
different
already
,
''
she
said
.
``
The
grass
is
greener
and
*NL*
things
are
sticking
up
everywhere
and
things
are
uncurling
and
green
*NL*
buds
of
leaves
are
showing
.
This
afternoon
I
am
sure
Dickon
will
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
long
warm
rain
had
done
strange
things
to
the
herbaceous
beds
which
*NL*
bordered
the
walk
by
the
lower
wall
.
There
were
things
sprouting
and
*NL*
pushing
out
from
the
roots
of
clumps
of
plants
and
there
were
actually
*NL*
here
and
there
glimpses
of
royal
purple
and
yellow
unfurling
among
the
*NL*
stems
of
crocuses
.
Six
months
before
Mistress
Mary
would
not
have
seen
*NL*
how
the
world
was
waking
up
,
but
now
she
missed
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
reached
the
place
where
the
door
hid
itself
under
the
ivy
,
*NL*
she
was
startled
by
a
curious
loud
sound
.
It
was
the
caw
--
caw
of
a
*NL*
crow
and
it
came
from
the
top
of
the
wall
,
and
when
she
looked
up
,
*NL*
there
sat
a
big
glossy-plumaged
blue-black
bird
,
looking
down
at
her
*NL*
very
wisely
indeed
.
She
had
never
seen
a
crow
so
close
before
and
he
*NL*
made
her
a
little
nervous
,
but
the
next
moment
he
spread
his
wings
and
*NL*
flapped
away
across
the
garden
.
She
hoped
he
was
not
going
to
stay
*NL*
inside
and
she
pushed
the
door
open
wondering
if
he
would
.
When
she
*NL*
got
fairly
into
the
garden
she
saw
that
he
probably
did
intend
to
stay
*NL*
because
he
had
alighted
on
a
dwarf
apple-tree
and
under
the
apple-tree
*NL*
was
lying
a
little
reddish
animal
with
a
Bushy
tail
,
and
both
of
them
*NL*
were
watching
the
stooping
body
and
rust-red
head
of
Dickon
,
who
was
*NL*
kneeling
on
the
grass
working
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
flew
across
the
grass
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Dickon
!
Dickon
!
''
she
cried
out
.
``
How
could
you
get
here
so
early
!
*NL*
How
could
you
!
The
sun
has
only
just
got
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
himself
,
laughing
and
glowing
,
and
tousled
;
his
eyes
like
a
*NL*
bit
of
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
was
up
long
before
him
.
How
could
I
have
stayed
*NL*
abed
!
Th
'
world

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
put
her
hands
on
her
chest
,
panting
,
as
if
she
had
been
running
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Dickon
!
Dickon
!
''
she
said
.
``
I
'm
so
happy
I
can
scarcely
breathe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
him
talking
to
a
stranger
,
the
little
bushy-tailed
animal
rose
*NL*
from
its
place
under
the
tree
and
came
to
him
,
and
the
rook
,
cawing
*NL*
once
,
flew
down
from
its
branch
and
settled
quietly
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
th
'
little
fox
cub
,
''
he
said
,
rubbing
the
little
reddish
*NL*
animal
's
head
.
``
It
's
named
Captain
.
An
'
this
here
's
Soot
.
Soot

*NL*
flew
across
th

moor
with
me

Captain

run
same
as
if
th
'
hounds
*NL*
had
been
after
him
.
They
both
felt
same
as
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
of
the
creatures
looked
as
if
he
were
the
least
afraid
of
Mary
.
*NL*
When
Dickon
began
to
walk
about
,
Soot
stayed
on
his
shoulder
and
*NL*
Captain
trotted
quietly
close
to
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
!
''
said
Dickon
.
``
See
how
these
has
pushed
up
,
an
'
these
an
'
*NL*
these
!
An
'
Eh
!
Look
at
these
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
himself
upon
his
knees
and
Mary
went
down
beside
him
.
They
*NL*
had
come
upon
a
whole
clump
of
crocuses
burst
into
purple
and
orange
*NL*
and
gold
.
Mary
bent
her
face
down
and
kissed
and
kissed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
kiss
a
person
in
that
way
,
''
she
said
when
she
lifted
her
*NL*
head
.
``
Flowers
are
so
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
puzzled
but
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
he
said
,
``
I
've
kissed
mother
many
a
time
that
way
when
I
come
in
*NL*
from
th
'
moor
after
a
day

roamin

an
'
she
stood
there
at
th
'
door
in
*NL*
th
'
sun
,
lookin
'
so
glad
an
'
comfortable
.
''
They
ran
from
one
part
of
*NL*
the
garden
to
another
and
found
so
many
wonders
that
they
were
obliged
*NL*
to
remind
themselves
that
they
must
whisper
or
speak
low
.
He
showed
*NL*
her
swelling
leafbuds
on
rose
branches
which
had
seemed
dead
.
He
*NL*
showed
her
ten
thousand
new
green
points
pushing
through
the
mould
.
*NL*
They
put
their
eager
young
noses
close
to
the
earth
and
sniffed
its
*NL*
warmed
springtime
breathing
;
they
dug
and
pulled
and
laughed
low
with
*NL*
rapture
until
Mistress
Mary
's
hair
was
as
tumbled
as
Dickon
's
and
her
*NL*
cheeks
were
almost
as
poppy
red
as
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
every
joy
on
earth
in
the
secret
garden
that
morning
,
and
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
them
came
a
delight
more
delightful
than
all
,
because
it
*NL*
was
more
wonderful
.
Swiftly
something
flew
across
the
wall
and
darted
*NL*
through
the
trees
to
a
close
grown
corner
,
a
little
flare
of
*NL*
red-breasted
bird
with
something
hanging
from
its
beak
.
Dickon
stood
*NL*
quite
still
and
put
his
hand
on
Mary
almost
as
if
they
had
suddenly
*NL*
found
themselves
laughing
in
a
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
munnot
stir
,
''
he
whispered
in
broad
Yorkshire
.
``
We
munnot
scarce
*NL*
breathe

I
knowed
he
was
mate-huntin

when
I
seed
him
last

It
's
Ben

Weatherstaff

robin

He
's
buildin

his
nest
.
He
'll
stay
here
if
us
*NL*
do
n't
fight
him
.
''
They
settled
down
softly
upon
the
grass
and
sat
there
*NL*
without
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Us
must
n't
seem
as
if
us
was
watchin

him
too
close

said
Dickon
.
*NL*
``
He
'd
be
out
with
us
for
good
if
he
got
th

notion

was
interferin

*NL*
now

He
'll
be
a
good
bit
different
till
all
this
is
over

settin

up

to
take
things

got
no

must
keep
still
a

bit
an

try
to
look

bushes

Then
when

he
's
got
used

I
'll
chirp
a
bit

he
'll

not

*NL*
*NL*
Mistress
Mary
was
not
at
all
sure
that
she
knew
,
as
Dickon
seemed
to
,
*NL*
how
to
try
to
look
like
grass
and
trees
and
bushes
.
But
he
had
said
*NL*
the
queer
thing
as
if
it
were
the
simplest
and
most
natural
thing
in
*NL*
the
world
,
and
she
felt
it
must
be
quite
easy
to
him
,
and
indeed
she
*NL*
watched
him
for
a
few
minutes
carefully
,
wondering
if
it
was
possible
*NL*
for
him
to
quietly
turn
green
and
put
out
branches
and
leaves
.
But
he
*NL*
only
sat
wonderfully
still
,
and
when
he
spoke
dropped
his
voice
to
such
*NL*
a
softness
that
it
was
curious
that
she
could
hear
him
,
but
she
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
part
o
'
th
'
springtime
,
this
nest-buildin

is

''
he
said
.
``
I
*NL*
warrant
it
's
been
goin

on
in
th

same
way
every
year
since
th

was
begun

their
way

thinkin

doin

things

You
can
lose

springtime
easier

than

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
talk
about

I
ca

at

Mary
said
as
softly

as
possible

``
We

talk

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll

said
Dickon

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

do
you
know
about
Colin

she
whispered

*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
his
head
to
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
tha

know
about

he

*NL*
*NL*

I

this

*NL*

me
to
come

He
says
I
'm
making
him
forget
about
being
ill
and
*NL*
dying

answered
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
looked
actually
relieved
as
soon
as
the
surprise
died
away
from
*NL*
his
round
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
o
'
that
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
I
'm
right
down
glad

It
makes
me

easier

I
knowed

nothin

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
like
hiding
the
garden

said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
never
tell
about

he
answered

``
But
I

*NL*
`
Mother

*NL*
*NL*
Mary
always
wanted
to
hear
about
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
she
say
?

she
asked
,
not
at
all
afraid
to
hear

*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
grinned
sweet-temperedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
just
like
her

what
she
said

he
answered

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you

about

asked
Mary

*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
as

about
Mester

,
an

they
knowed
Mester
Craven
did
n't
like
*NL*
him
to

Folks
is
sorry
for

because
Mrs.

Martha

she
did

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
told
him
her
story
about
the
midnight
wuthering
of
the
wind
which
*NL*
had
wakened
her
and
about
the
faint
far-off
sounds
of
the
complaining
*NL*
voice
which
had
led
her
down
the
dark
corridors
with
her
candle
and
had
*NL*
ended
with
her
opening
of
the
door
of
the
dimly
lighted
room
with
the
*NL*
carven
four-posted
bed
in
the
corner
.
When
she
described
the
small
*NL*
ivory-white
face
and
the
strange
black-rimmed
eyes
Dickon
shook
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Them

just
like
his

only
hers

he
said

They

as
Mr.

bear
to

him

's
because

Mary

*NL*
``
No

afraid

*NL*
*NL*
``
Colin

so
afraid

himself

*NL*
The
fox

lying
on
the
grass
close
by
him

looking
up
to
ask
for
a

pat
now

then
,
and
Dickon
bent
down
and
rubbed
his
neck
softly
and
*NL*
thought
a
few
minutes
in
silence

Presently
he
lifted
his
head
and
*NL*
looked
round
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When

we
got
in

it

*NL*
Mary
looked
and
caught
her
breath
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
''
she
cried
,
``
the
gray
wall
is
changing

It
is
as
if

over

almost

eagerly

something
about

to

on

rose-bushes

be

explained
Dickon

``
I

wonderin

*NL*
``

him

said
Mary

I
've
wondered

he

I
've
wondered
if
we
could
bring
him
here
without
any
one
*NL*
seeing
us

I
thought
perhaps
you
could
push
his
carriage

The
doctor

said
he
must
have
fresh
air
and
if
he
wants

to
take
him
out
no

out

perhaps
they

will
be
glad

will
go
out

He
could
order
the
gardeners

to
keep
away
so
they
would
n't
find
out

*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
was
thinking
very
hard
as
he
scratched
Captain

back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

be
good
for
him

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
been
lying
in
his
room
so
long

so
afraid

his
back
that
it
has
made
him
queer

said
Mary
.
``
He
knows
a
good
many
*NL*
things
out

he
has

been
too
ill
to
notice
things

he
hates
going
out
of
doors
and
hates
*NL*
gardens
and
gardeners
.
But
he
likes
to
hear
about
this
garden
because
*NL*
it
is
a
secret
.
I
dare
n't
tell
him
much
but
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Us
'll
have
him
out
here
sometime
for
sure

Dickon
.
``
I
could
*NL*
push
his
carriage
well
enough

robin
an

his
*NL*
mate
has
been
workin
'
while
we
've
been
sittin

here
?
Look
at
him
*NL*
perched
on
that
branch
wonderin

where
it
'd
be
best
to
put
that
twig
*NL*
he
's
got
in
his
beak

*NL*
*NL*
He
made
one
of
his
low
whistling
calls
and
the
robin
turned
his
head
*NL*
and
looked
at
him
inquiringly
,
still
holding
his
twig
.
Dickon
spoke
to
*NL*
him
as
Ben
Weatherstaff
did
,
but
Dickon
's
tone
was
one
of
friendly
*NL*
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wheres
`
ever

'
puts

he
said
,
``
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
like
to
hear
you
talk
to
him

Mary
said
,
laughing
*NL*
delightedly
.
``
Ben
Weatherstaff
scolds
him
and
makes
fun
of
him

and
he
*NL*
hops
about
and
looks
as
if

understood
every
word
,
and
I
know
he
*NL*
likes
it
.
Ben
Weatherstaff
says
he
is
so
conceited
he
would
rather
*NL*
have
stones
thrown
at
him
than
not
be
noticed

*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
laughed
too
and
went
on
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha

us
wo

he
said
to
the
robin

*NL*
*NL*
And
though
the
robin
did
not
answer
,
because
his
beak
was
occupied
,
*NL*
Mary
knew
that
when
he
flew
away
with
his
twig
to
his
own
corner
of
the
*NL*
garden
the
darkness
of
his
dew-bright
eye
meant
that
he
would
not
tell
*NL*
their
secret
for
the
world

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
WO
N'T
!
''
SAID
MARY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
a
great
deal
to
do
that
morning
and
Mary
was
late
in
*NL*
returning
to
the
house
and
was
also
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
her
*NL*
work
that
she
quite
forgot
Colin
until
the
last
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
Colin
that
I
ca
n't
come
and
see
him
yet
,
''
she
said
to
Martha
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
busy
in
the
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
looked
rather
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
Miss
Mary
,
''
she
said
,
``
it
may
put
him
all
out
of
humor
when
I
tell
*NL*
him
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mary
was
not
as
afraid
of
him
as
other
people
were
and
she
was
not
*NL*
a
self-sacrificing
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stay
,
''
she
answered
.
``
Dickon
's
waiting
for
me
;
''
and
she
ran
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
was
even
lovelier
and
busier
than
the
morning
had
been
.
*NL*
Already
nearly
all
the
weeds
were
cleared
out
of
the
garden
and
most
of
*NL*
the
roses
and
trees
had
been
pruned
or
dug
about
.
Dickon
had
brought
a
*NL*
spade
of
his
own
and
he
had
taught
Mary
to
use
all
her
tools
,
so
that
*NL*
by
this
time
it
was
plain
that
though
the
lovely
wild
place
was
not
*NL*
likely
to
become
a
``
gardener
's
garden
''
it
would
be
a
wilderness
of
*NL*
growing
things
before
the
springtime
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
'll
be
apple
blossoms
an
'
cherry
blossoms
overhead
,
''
Dickon
said
,
*NL*
working
away
with
all
his
might
.
``
An
'
there
'll
be
peach
an
'
plum
trees
*NL*
in
bloom
against
th
'
walls
,
an
'
th
'
grass
'll
be
a
carpet
o
'
flowers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
fox
and
the
rook
were
as
happy
and
busy
as
they
were
,
and
*NL*
the
robin
and
his
mate
flew
backward
and
forward
like
tiny
streaks
of
*NL*
lightning
.
Sometimes
the
rook
flapped
his
black
wings
and
soared
away
*NL*
over
the
tree-tops
in
the
park
.
Each
time
he
came
back
and
perched
*NL*
near
Dickon
and
cawed
several
times
as
if
he
were
relating
his
*NL*
adventures
,
and
Dickon
talked
to
him
just
as
he
had
talked
to
the
*NL*
robin
.
Once
when
Dickon
was
so
busy
that
he
did
not
answer
him
at
*NL*
first
,
Soot
flew
on
to
his
shoulders
and
gently
tweaked
his
ear
with
*NL*
his
large
beak
.
When
Mary
wanted
to
rest
a
little
Dickon
sat
down
with
*NL*
her
under
a
tree
and
once
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
pocket
and
played
*NL*
the
soft
strange
little
notes
and
two
squirrels
appeared
on
the
wall
*NL*
and
looked
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
's
a
good
bit
stronger
than
tha
'
was
,
''
Dickon
said
,
looking
at
her
*NL*
as
she
was
digging
.
``
Tha
's
beginning
to
look
different
,
for
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
glowing
with
exercise
and
good
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
getting
fatter
and
fatter
every
day
,
''
she
said
quite
exultantly
.
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Medlock
will
have
to
get
me
some
bigger
dresses
.
Martha
says
my
*NL*
hair
is
growing
thicker

It
is
n't
so
flat
and
stringy

*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
beginning
to
set
and
sending
deep
gold-colored
rays
*NL*
slanting
under
the
trees
when
they
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
be
fine
tomorrow
,
''
said
Dickon
.
``
I
'll
be
at
work
by
sunrise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
will
I
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
back
to
the
house
as
quickly
as
her
feet
would
carry
her
.
She
*NL*
wanted
to
tell
Colin
about
Dickon
's
fox
cub
and
the
rook
and
about
what
*NL*
the
springtime
had
been
doing
.
She
felt
sure
he
would
like
to
hear
.
*NL*
So
it
was
not
very
pleasant
when
she
opened
the
door
of
her
room
,
to
*NL*
see
Martha
standing
waiting
for
her
with
a
doleful
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
she
asked
.
``
What
did
Colin
say
when
you
told
him
*NL*
I
could
n't
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
said
Martha
,
``
I
wish
tha
'd
gone
.
He
was
nigh
goin
'
into
one
o
'
*NL*
his
tantrums
.
There
's
been
a
nice
to
do
all
afternoon
to
keep
him
*NL*
quiet
.
He
would
watch
the
clock
all
th
'
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
lips
pinched
themselves
together
.
She
was
no
more
used
to
*NL*
considering
other
people
than
Colin
was
and
she
saw
no
reason
why
an
*NL*
ill-tempered
boy
should
interfere
with
the
thing
she
liked
best
.
She
*NL*
knew
nothing
about
the
pitifulness
of
people
who
had
been
ill
and
*NL*
nervous
and
who
did
not
know
that
they
could
control
their
tempers
and
*NL*
need
not
make
other
people
ill
and
nervous
,
too
.
When
she
had
had
a
*NL*
headache
in
India
she
had
done
her
best
to
see
that
everybody
else
also
*NL*
had
a
headache
or
something
quite
as
bad
.
And
she
felt
she
was
quite
*NL*
right
;
but
of
course
now
she
felt
that
Colin
was
quite
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
on
his
sofa
when
she
went
into
his
room
.
He
was
lying
flat
*NL*
on
his
back
in
bed
and
he
did
not
turn
his
head
toward
her
as
she
came
*NL*
in
.
This
was
a
bad
beginning
and
Mary
marched
up
to
him
with
her
stiff
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
get
up
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
get
up
this
morning
when
I
thought
you
were
coming
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
,
without
looking
at
her
.
``
I
made
them
put
me
back
in
bed
this
*NL*
afternoon
.
My
back
ached
and
my
head
ached
and
I
was
tired
.
Why
*NL*
did
n't
you
come
?
''
``
I
was
working
in
the
garden
with
Dickon
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
frowned
and
condescended
to
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
let
that
boy
come
here
if
you
go
and
stay
with
him
instead
of
*NL*
coming
to
talk
to
me
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
flew
into
a
fine
passion
.
She
could
fly
into
a
passion
without
*NL*
making
a
noise
.
She
just
grew
sour
and
obstinate
and
did
not
care
what
*NL*
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
send
Dickon
away
,
I
'll
never
come
into
this
room
again
!
''
she
*NL*
retorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
to
if
I
want
you
,
''
said
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
!
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
make
you
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
They
shall
drag
you
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
they
,
Mr.
Rajah
!
''
said
Mary
fiercely
.
``
They
may
drag
me
in
but
*NL*
they
ca
n't
make
me
talk
when
they
get
me
here
.
I
'll
sit
and
clench
my
*NL*
teeth
and
never
tell
you
one
thing
.
I
wo
n't
even
look
at
you
.
I
'll
*NL*
stare
at
the
floor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
a
nice
agreeable
pair
as
they
glared
at
each
other
.
If
they
*NL*
had
been
two
little
street
boys
they
would
have
sprung
at
each
other
*NL*
and
had
a
rough-and-tumble
fight
.
As
it
was
,
they
did
the
next
thing
*NL*
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
selfish
thing
!
''
cried
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
?
''
said
Mary
.
``
Selfish
people
always
say
that
.
Any
one
*NL*
is
selfish
who
does
n't
do
what
they
want
.
You
're
more
selfish
than
I
*NL*
am
.
You
're
the
most
selfish
boy
I
ever
saw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
!
''
snapped
Colin
.
``
I
'm
not
as
selfish
as
your
fine
Dickon
is
!
*NL*
He
keeps
you
playing
in
the
dirt
when
he
knows
I
am
all
by
myself
.
*NL*
He
's
selfish
,
if
you
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
's
eyes
flashed
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
nicer
than
any
other
boy
that
ever
lived
!
''
she
said
.
``
He
's
--
he
's
*NL*
like
an
angel
!
''
It
might
sound
rather
silly
to
say
that
but
she
did
not
*NL*
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice
angel
!
''
Colin
sneered
ferociously
.
``
He
's
a
common
cottage
boy
*NL*
off
the
moor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
better
than
a
common
Rajah
!
''
retorted
Mary
.
``
He
's
a
thousand
*NL*
times
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Because
she
was
the
stronger
of
the
two
she
was
beginning
to
get
the
*NL*
better
of
him
.
The
truth
was
that
he
had
never
had
a
fight
with
any
*NL*
one
like
himself
in
his
life
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
it
was
rather
good
*NL*
for
him
,
though
neither
he
nor
Mary
knew
anything
about
that
.
He
*NL*
turned
his
head
on
his
pillow
and
shut
his
eyes
and
a
big
tear
was
*NL*
squeezed
out
and
ran
down
his
cheek
.
He
was
beginning
to
feel
pathetic
*NL*
and
sorry
for
himself
--
not
for
any
one
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
as
selfish
as
you
,
because
I
'm
always
ill
,
and
I
'm
sure
there
*NL*
is
a
lump
coming
on
my
back
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
I
am
going
to
die
besides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
!
''
contradicted
Mary
unsympathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
his
eyes
quite
wide
with
indignation
.
He
had
never
heard
*NL*
such
a
thing
said
before
.
He
was
at
once
furious
and
slightly
pleased
,
*NL*
if
a
person
could
be
both
at
one
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
?
''
he
cried
.
``
I
am
!
You
know
I
am
!
Everybody
says
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
!
''
said
Mary
sourly
.
``
You
just
say
that
to
make
*NL*
people
sorry
.
I
believe
you
're
proud
of
it
.
I
do
n't
believe
it
!
If
*NL*
you
were
a
nice
boy
it
might
be
true
--
but
you
're
too
nasty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
invalid
back
Colin
sat
up
in
bed
in
quite
a
healthy
*NL*
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
out
of
the
room
!
''
he
shouted
and
he
caught
hold
of
his
pillow
and
*NL*
threw
it
at
her
.
He
was
not
strong
enough
to
throw
it
far
and
it
only
*NL*
fell
at
her
feet
,
but
Mary
's
face
looked
as
pinched
as
a
nutcracker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
,
''
she
said
.
``
And
I
wo
n't
come
back
!
''
She
walked
to
the
door
*NL*
and
when
she
reached
it
she
turned
round
and
spoke
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
tell
you
all
sorts
of
nice
things
,
''
she
said
.
``
Dickon
*NL*
brought
his
fox
and
his
rook
and
I
was
going
to
tell
you
all
about
*NL*
them
.
Now
I
wo
n't
tell
you
a
single
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
marched
out
of
the
door
and
closed
it
behind
her
,
and
there
to
her
*NL*
great
astonishment
she
found
the
trained
nurse
standing
as
if
she
had
*NL*
been
listening
and
,
more
amazing
still
--
she
was
laughing
.
She
was
a
*NL*
big
handsome
young
woman
who
ought
not
to
have
been
a
trained
nurse
at
*NL*
all
,
as
she
could
not
bear
invalids
and
she
was
always
making
excuses
*NL*
to
leave
Colin
to
Martha
or
any
one
else
who
would
take
her
place
.
*NL*
Mary
had
never
liked
her
,
and
she
simply
stood
and
gazed
up
at
her
as
*NL*
she
stood
giggling
into
her
handkerchief
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
laughing
at
?
''
she
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
you
two
young
ones
,
''
said
the
nurse
.
``
It
's
the
best
thing
that
*NL*
could
happen
to
the
sickly
pampered
thing
to
have
some
one
to
stand
up
*NL*
to
him
that
's
as
spoiled
as
himself
;
''
and
she
laughed
into
her
*NL*
handkerchief
again
.
``
If
he
'd
had
a
young
vixen
of
a
sister
to
fight
*NL*
with
it
would
have
been
the
saving
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
going
to
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
and
I
do
n't
care
,
''
said
the
nurse
.
``
Hysterics
and
temper
*NL*
are
half
what
ails
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
hysterics
?
''
asked
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
find
out
if
you
work
him
into
a
tantrum
after
this
--
but
at
any
*NL*
rate
you
've
given
him
something
to
have
hysterics
about
,
and
I
'm
glad
*NL*
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
went
back
to
her
room
not
feeling
at
all
as
she
had
felt
when
she
*NL*
had
come
in
from
the
garden
.
She
was
cross
and
disappointed
but
not
at
*NL*
all
sorry
for
Colin
.
She
had
looked
forward
to
telling
him
a
great
*NL*
many
things
and
she
had
meant
to
try
to
make
up
her
mind
whether
it
*NL*
would
be
safe
to
trust
him
with
the
great
secret
.
She
had
been
*NL*
beginning
to
think
it
would
be
,
but
now
she
had
changed
her
mind
*NL*
entirely
.
She
would
never
tell
him
and
he
could
stay
in
his
room
and
*NL*
never
get
any
fresh
air
and
die
if
he
liked
!
It
would
serve
him
right
!
*NL*
She
felt
so
sour
and
unrelenting
that
for
a
few
minutes
she
almost
*NL*
forgot
about
Dickon
and
the
green
veil
creeping
over
the
world
and
the
*NL*
soft
wind
blowing
down
from
the
moor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martha
was
waiting
for
her
and
the
trouble
in
her
face
had
been
*NL*
temporarily
replaced
by
interest
and
curiosity
.
There
was
a
wooden
box
*NL*
on
the
table
and
its
cover
had
been
removed
and
revealed
that
it
was
*NL*
full
of
neat
packages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Craven
sent
it
to
you
,
''
said
Martha
.
``
It
looks
as
if
it
had
*NL*
picture-books
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
remembered
what
he
had
asked
her
the
day
she
had
gone
to
his
room
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
anything
--
dolls
--
toys
--
books
?
''
She
opened
the
package
*NL*
wondering
if
he
had
sent
a
doll
,
and
also
wondering
what
she
should
do
*NL*
with
it
if
he
had
.
But
he
had
not
sent
one
.
There
were
several
*NL*
beautiful
books
such
as
Colin
had
,
and
two
of
them
were
about
gardens
*NL*
and
were
full
of
pictures
.
There
were
two
or
three
games
and
there
was
*NL*
a
beautiful
little
writing-case
with
a
gold
monogram
on
it
and
a
gold
*NL*
pen
and
inkstand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
so
nice
that
her
pleasure
began
to
crowd
her
anger
out
*NL*
of
her
mind
.
She
had
not
expected
him
to
remember
her
at
all
and
her
*NL*
hard
little
heart
grew
quite
warm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
write
better
than
I
can
print
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
the
first
thing
I
*NL*
shall
write
with
that
pen
will
be
a
letter
to
tell
him
I
am
much
*NL*
obliged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
had
been
friends
with
Colin
she
would
have
run
to
show
him
her
*NL*
presents
at
once
,
and
they
would
have
looked
at
the
pictures
and
read
*NL*
some
of
the
gardening
books
and
perhaps
tried
playing
the
games
,
and
he
*NL*
would
have
enjoyed
himself
so
much
he
would
never
once
have
thought
he
*NL*
was
going
to
die
or
have
put
his
hand
on
his
spine
to
see
if
there
was
*NL*
a
lump
coming
.
He
had
a
way
of
doing
that
which
she
could
not
bear
.
*NL*
It
gave
her
an
uncomfortable
frightened
feeling
because
he
always
*NL*
looked
so
frightened
himself
.
He
said
that
if
he
felt
even
quite
a
*NL*
little
lump
some
day
he
should
know
his
hunch
had
begun
to
grow
.
*NL*
Something
he
had
heard
Mrs.
Medlock
whispering
to
the
nurse
had
given
*NL*
him
the
idea
and
he
had
thought
over
it
in
secret
until
it
was
quite
*NL*
firmly
fixed
in
his
mind
.
Mrs.
Medlock
had
said
his
father
's
back
had
*NL*
begun
to
show
its
crookedness
in
that
way
when
he
was
a
child
.
He
had
*NL*
never
told
any
one
but
Mary
that
most
of
his
``
tantrums
''
as
they
called
*NL*
them
grew
out
of
his
hysterical
hidden
fear
.
Mary
had
been
sorry
for
*NL*
him
when
he
had
told
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
always
began
to
think
about
it
when
he
was
cross
or
tired
,
''
she
*NL*
said
to
herself
.
``
And
he
has
been
cross
today
.
Perhaps
--
perhaps
he
*NL*
has
been
thinking
about
it
all
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
still
,
looking
down
at
the
carpet
and
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
I
would
never
go
back
again
--
''
she
hesitated
,
knitting
her
*NL*
brows
--
``
but
perhaps
,
just
perhaps
,
I
will
go
and
see
--
if
he
wants
*NL*
me
--
in
the
morning
.
Perhaps
he
'll
try
to
throw
his
pillow
at
me
again
,
*NL*
but
--
I
think
--
I
'll

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
A
TANTRUM
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
got
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
had
worked
hard
in
the
*NL*
garden
and
she
was
tired
and
sleepy
,
so
as
soon
as
Martha
had
brought
*NL*
her
supper
and
she
had
eaten
it
,
she
was
glad
to
go
to
bed
.
As
she
*NL*
laid
her
head
on
the
pillow
she
murmured
to
herself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
out
before
breakfast
and
work
with
Dickon
and
then
*NL*
afterward
--
I
believe
--
I
'll
go
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
when
she
was
awakened
by
*NL*
such
dreadful
sounds
that
she
jumped
out
of
bed
in
an
instant
.
What
*NL*
was
it
--
what
was
it
?
The
next
minute
she
felt
quite
sure
she
knew
.
*NL*
Doors
were
opened
and
shut
and
there
were
hurrying
feet
in
the
*NL*
corridors
and
some
one
was
crying
and
screaming
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
screaming
and
crying
in
a
horrible
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Colin
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
's
having
one
of
those
tantrums
the
nurse
*NL*
called
hysterics
.
How
awful
it
sounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
listened
to
the
sobbing
screams
she
did
not
wonder
that
people
*NL*
were
so
frightened
that
they
gave
him
his
own
way
in
everything
rather
*NL*
than
hear
them
.
She
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
and
felt
sick
and
*NL*
shivering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
''
she
kept
saying
.
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
she
wondered
if
he
would
stop
if
she
dared
go
to
him
and
then
she
*NL*
remembered
how
he
had
driven
her
out
of
the
room
and
thought
that
*NL*
perhaps
the
sight
of
her
might
make
him
worse
.
Even
when
she
pressed
*NL*
her
hands
more
tightly
over
her
ears
she
could
not
keep
the
awful
*NL*
sounds
out
.
She
hated
them
so
and
was
so
terrified
by
them
that
*NL*
suddenly
they
began
to
make
her
angry
and
she
felt
as
if
she
should
*NL*
like
to
fly
into
a
tantrum
herself
and
frighten
him
as
he
was
*NL*
frightening
her
.
She
was
not
used
to
any
one
's
tempers
but
her
own
.
*NL*
She
took
her
hands
from
her
ears
and
sprang
up
and
stamped
her
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ought
to
be
stopped
!
Somebody
ought
to
make
him
stop
!
Somebody
*NL*
ought
to
beat
him
!
''
she
cried
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
she
heard
feet
almost
running
down
the
corridor
and
her
door
*NL*
opened
and
the
nurse
came
in
.
She
was
not
laughing
now
by
any
means
.
*NL*
She
even
looked
rather
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
worked
himself
into
hysterics
,
''
she
said
in
a
great
hurry
.
*NL*
``
He
'll
do
himself
harm
.
No
one
can
do
anything
with
him
.
You
come
and
*NL*
try
,
like
a
good
child
.
He
likes
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
turned
me
out
of
the
room
this
morning
,
''
said
Mary
,
stamping
her
*NL*
foot
with
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stamp
rather
pleased
the
nurse
.
The
truth
was
that
she
had
been
*NL*
afraid
she
might
find
Mary
crying
and
hiding
her
head
under
the
*NL*
bed-clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
're
in
the
right
humor
.
You
go
and
*NL*
scold
him
.
Give
him
something
new
to
think
of
.
Do
go
,
child
,
as
quick
*NL*
as
ever
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
until
afterward
that
Mary
realized
that
the
thing
had
been
*NL*
funny
as
well
as
dreadful
--
that
it
was
funny
that
all
the
grown-up
*NL*
people
were
so
frightened
that
they
came
to
a
little
girl
just
because
*NL*
they
guessed
she
was
almost
as
bad
as
Colin
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flew
along
the
corridor
and
the
nearer
she
got
to
the
screams
the
*NL*
higher
her
temper
mounted
.
She
felt
quite
wicked
by
the
time
she
*NL*
reached
the
door
.
She
slapped
it
open
with
her
hand
and
ran
across
the
*NL*
room
to
the
four-posted
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
stop
!
''
she
almost
shouted
.
``
You
stop
!
I
hate
you
!
Everybody
*NL*
hates
you
!
I
wish
everybody
would
run
out
of
the
house
and
let
you
*NL*
scream
yourself
to
death
!
You
will
scream
yourself
to
death
in
a
*NL*
minute
,
and
I
wish
you
would
!
''
A
nice
sympathetic
child
could
neither
*NL*
have
thought
nor
said
such
things
,
but
it
just
happened
that
the
shock
*NL*
of
hearing
them
was
the
best
possible
thing
for
this
hysterical
boy
*NL*
whom
no
one
had
ever
dared
to
restrain
or
contradict
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
lying
on
his
face
beating
his
pillow
with
his
hands
and
he
*NL*
actually
almost
jumped
around
,
he
turned
so
quickly
at
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
furious
little
voice
.
His
face
looked
dreadful
,
white
and
red
and
*NL*
swollen
,
and
he
was
gasping
and
choking
;
but
savage
little
Mary
did
not
*NL*
care
an
atom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
scream
another
scream
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
'll
scream
too
--
and
I
can
*NL*
scream
louder
than
you
can
and
I
'll
frighten
you
,
I
'll
frighten
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
actually
had
stopped
screaming
because
she
had
startled
him
so
.
The
*NL*
scream
which
had
been
coming
almost
choked
him
.
The
tears
were
*NL*
streaming
down
his
face
and
he
shook
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stop
!
''
he
gasped
and
sobbed
.
``
I
ca
n't
--
I
ca
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
!
''
shouted
Mary
.
``
Half
that
ails
you
is
hysterics
and
*NL*
temper
--
just
hysterics
--
hysterics
--
hysterics
!
''
and
she
stamped
each
*NL*
time
she
said
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
the
lump
--
I
felt
it
,
''
choked
out
Colin
.
``
I
knew
I
should
.
I
*NL*
shall
have
a
hunch
on
my
back
and
then
I
shall
die
,
''
and
he
began
to
*NL*
writhe
again
and
turned
on
his
face
and
sobbed
and
wailed
but
he
did
n't
*NL*
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
feel
a
lump
!
''
contradicted
Mary
fiercely
.
``
If
you
did
it
*NL*
was
only
a
hysterical
lump
.
Hysterics
makes
lumps
.
There
's
nothing
*NL*
the
matter
with
your
horrid
back
--
nothing
but
hysterics
!
Turn
over
and
*NL*
let
me
look
at
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
liked
the
word
``
hysterics
''
and
felt
somehow
as
if
it
had
an
effect
*NL*
on
him
.
He
was
probably
like
herself
and
had
never
heard
it
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nurse
,
''
she
commanded
,
``
come
here
and
show
me
his
back
this
minute
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
,
Mrs.
Medlock
and
Martha
had
been
standing
huddled
together
*NL*
near
the
door
staring
at
her
,
their
mouths
half
open
.
All
three
had
*NL*
gasped
with
fright
more
than
once
.
The
nurse
came
forward
as
if
she
*NL*
were
half
afraid
.
Colin
was
heaving
with
great
breathless
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
--
he
wo
n't
let
me
,
''
she
hesitated
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
heard
her
,
however
,
and
he
gasped
out
between
two
sobs
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sh-show
her
!
She-she
'll
see
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
poor
thin
back
to
look
at
when
it
was
bared
.
Every
rib
could
*NL*
be
counted
and
every
joint
of
the
spine
,
though
Mistress
Mary
did
not
*NL*
count
them
as
she
bent
over
and
examined
them
with
a
solemn
savage
*NL*
little
face
.
She
looked
so
sour
and
old-fashioned
that
the
nurse
*NL*
turned
her
head
aside
to
hide
the
twitching
of
her
mouth
.
There
was
*NL*
just
a
minute
's
silence
,
for
even
Colin
tried
to
hold
his
breath
while
*NL*
Mary
looked
up
and
down
his
spine
,
and
down
and
up
,
as
intently
as
if
*NL*
she
had
been
the
great
doctor
from
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
not
a
single
lump
there
!
''
she
said
at
last
.
``
There
's
not
a
*NL*
lump
as
big
as
a
pin
--
except
backbone
lumps
,
and
you
can
only
feel
them
*NL*
because
you
're
thin
.
I
've
got
backbone
lumps
myself
,
and
they
used
to
*NL*
stick
out
as
much
as
yours
do
,
until
I
began
to
get
fatter
,
and
I
am
*NL*
not
fat
enough
yet
to
hide
them
.
There
's
not
a
lump
as
big
as
a
pin
!
*NL*
If
you
ever
say
there
is
again
,
I
shall
laugh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
but
Colin
himself
knew
what
effect
those
crossly
spoken
childish
*NL*
words
had
on
him
.
If
he
had
ever
had
any
one
to
talk
to
about
his
*NL*
secret
terrors
--
if
he
had
ever
dared
to
let
himself
ask
questions
--
if
*NL*
he
had
had
childish
companions
and
had
not
lain
on
his
back
in
the
huge
*NL*
closed
house
,
breathing
an
atmosphere
heavy
with
the
fears
of
people
*NL*
who
were
most
of
them
ignorant
and
tired
of
him
,
he
would
have
found
*NL*
out
that
most
of
his
fright
and
illness
was
created
by
himself
.
But
he
*NL*
had
lain
and
thought
of
himself
and
his
aches
and
weariness
for
hours
*NL*
and
days
and
months
and
years
.
And
now
that
an
angry
unsympathetic
*NL*
little
girl
insisted
obstinately
that
he
was
not
as
ill
as
he
thought
*NL*
he
was
he
actually
felt
as
if
she
might
be
speaking
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
,
''
ventured
the
nurse
,
``
that
he
thought
he
had
a
lump
on
*NL*
his
spine
.
His
back
is
weak
because
he
wo
n't
try
to
sit
up
.
I
could
*NL*
have
told
him
there
was
no
lump
there
.
''
Colin
gulped
and
turned
his
*NL*
face
a
little
to
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
C-could
you
?
''
he
said
pathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
said
Mary
,
and
she
gulped
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
turned
on
his
face
again
and
but
for
his
long-drawn
broken
*NL*
breaths
,
which
were
the
dying
down
of
his
storm
of
sobbing
,
he
lay
*NL*
still
for
a
minute
,
though
great
tears
streamed
down
his
face
and
wet
*NL*
the
pillow
.
Actually
the
tears
meant
that
a
curious
great
relief
had
*NL*
come
to
him
.
Presently
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
nurse
again
and
*NL*
strangely
enough
he
was
not
like
a
Rajah
at
all
as
he
spoke
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
--
I
could
--
live
to
grow
up
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
was
neither
clever
nor
soft-hearted
but
she
could
repeat
some
*NL*
of
the
London
doctor
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
probably
will
if
you
will
do
what
you
are
told
to
do
and
not
give
*NL*
way
to
your
temper
,
and
stay
out
a
great
deal
in
the
fresh
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
's
tantrum
had
passed
and
he
was
weak
and
worn
out
with
crying
and
*NL*
this
perhaps
made
him
feel
gentle
.
He
put
out
his
hand
a
little
toward
*NL*
Mary
,
and
I
am
glad
to
say
that
,
her
own
tantum
having
passed
,
she
was
*NL*
softened
too
and
met
him
half-way
with
her
hand
,
so
that
it
was
a
sort
*NL*
of
making
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
--
I
'll
go
out
with
you
,
Mary
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
sha
n't
hate
fresh
air
*NL*
if
we
can
find
--
''
He
remembered
just
in
time
to
stop
himself
from
*NL*
saying
``
if
we
can
find
the
secret
garden
''
and
he
ended
,
``
I
shall
like
*NL*
to
go
out
with
you
if
Dickon
will
come
and
push
my
chair
.
I
do
so
want
*NL*
to
see
Dickon
and
the
fox
and
the
crow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
remade
the
tumbled
bed
and
shook
and
straightened
the
*NL*
pillows
.
Then
she
made
Colin
a
cup
of
beef
tea
and
gave
a
cup
to
Mary
,
*NL*
who
really
was
very
glad
to
get
it
after
her
excitement
.
Mrs.
Medlock
*NL*
and
Martha
gladly
slipped
away
,
and
after
everything
was
neat
and
calm
*NL*
and
in
order
the
nurse
looked
as
if
she
would
very
gladly
slip
away
*NL*
also
.
She
was
a
healthy
young
woman
who
resented
being
robbed
of
her
*NL*
sleep
and
she
yawned
quite
openly
as
she
looked
at
Mary
,
who
had
pushed
*NL*
her
big
footstool
close
to
the
four-posted
bed
and
was
holding
Colin
's
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
go
back
and
get
your
sleep
out
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
'll
drop
off
*NL*
after
a
while
--
if
he
's
not
too
upset
.
Then
I
'll
lie
down
myself
in
the
*NL*
next
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
me
to
sing
you
that
song
I
learned
from
my
Ayah
?
''
Mary
*NL*
whispered
to
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
pulled
hers
gently
and
he
turned
his
tired
eyes
on
her
*NL*
appealingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
he
answered
.
``
It
's
such
a
soft
song
.
I
shall
go
to
sleep
*NL*
in
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
put
him
to
sleep
,
''
Mary
said
to
the
yawning
nurse
.
``
You
can
go
*NL*
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
nurse
,
with
an
attempt
at
reluctance
.
``
If
he
does
n't
*NL*
go
to
sleep
in
half
an
hour
you
must
call
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
answered
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
was
out
of
the
room
in
a
minute
and
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
*NL*
Colin
pulled
Mary
's
hand
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
almost
told
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
I
stopped
myself
in
time
.
I
wo
n't
talk
*NL*
and
I
'll
go
to
sleep
,
but
you
said
you
had
a
whole
lot
of
nice
things
*NL*
to
tell
me
.
Have
you
--
do
you
think
you
have
found
out
anything
at
all
*NL*
about
the
way
into
the
secret
garden
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
looked
at
his
poor
little
tired
face
and
swollen
eyes
and
her
*NL*
heart
relented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-es
,
''
she
answered
,
``
I
think
I
have
.
And
if
you
will
go
to
sleep
I
*NL*
will
tell
you
tomorrow
.
''
His
hand
quite
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mary
!
''
he
said
.
``
Oh
,
Mary
!
If
I
could
get
into
it
I
think
I
*NL*
should
live
to
grow
up
!
Do
you
suppose
that
instead
of
singing
the
Ayah
*NL*
song
--
you
could
just
tell
me
softly
as
you
did
that
first
day
what
you
*NL*
imagine
it
looks
like
inside
?
I
am
sure
it
will
make
me
go
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Mary
.
``
Shut
your
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
quite
still
and
she
held
his
hand
and
began
*NL*
to
speak
very
slowly
and
in
a
very
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
has
been
left
alone
so
long
--
that
it
has
grown
all
into
a
*NL*
lovely
tangle
.
I
think
the
roses
have
climbed
and
climbed
and
climbed
*NL*
until
they
hang
from
the
branches
and
walls
and
creep
over
the
*NL*
ground
--
almost
like
a
strange
gray
mist
.
Some
of
them
have
died
but
*NL*
many
--
are
alive
and
when
the
summer
comes
there
will
be
curtains
and
*NL*
fountains
of
roses
.
I
think
the
ground
is
full
of
daffodils
and
*NL*
snowdrops
and
lilies
and
iris
working
their
way
out
of
the
dark
.
Now
*NL*
the
spring
has
begun
--
perhaps
--
perhaps
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
soft
drone
of
her
voice
was
making
him
stiller
and
stiller
and
she
*NL*
saw
it
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
they
are
coming
up
through
the
grass
--
perhaps
there
are
*NL*
clusters
of
purple
crocuses
and
gold
ones
--
even
now
.
Perhaps
the
*NL*
leaves
are
beginning
to
break
out
and
uncurl
--
and
perhaps
--
the
gray
is
*NL*
changing
and
a
green
gauze
veil
is
creeping
--
and
creeping
*NL*
over
--
everything
.
And
the
birds
are
coming
to
look
at
it
--
because
it
*NL*
is
--
so
safe
and
still
.
And
perhaps
--
perhaps
--
perhaps
--
''
very
softly
*NL*
and
slowly
indeed
,
``
the
robin
has
found
a
mate
--
and
is
building
a
nest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Colin
was
asleep
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
``
THA
'
MUNNOT
WASTE
NO
TIME
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
Mary
did
not
waken
early
the
next
morning
.
She
slept
late
*NL*
because
she
was
tired
,
and
when
Martha
brought
her
breakfast
she
told
*NL*
her
that
though
.
Colin
was
quite
quiet
he
was
ill
and
feverish
as
he
*NL*
always
was
after
he
had
worn
himself
out
with
a
fit
of
crying
.
Mary
*NL*
ate
her
breakfast
slowly
as
she
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
he
wishes
tha
'
would
please
go
and
see
him
as
soon
as
tha
'
*NL*
can
,
''
Martha
said
.
``
It
's
queer
what
a
fancy
he
's
took
to
thee
.
Tha
'
*NL*
did
give
it
him
last
night
for
sure
--
did
n't
tha
?
Nobody
else
would
have
*NL*
dared
to
do
it
.
Eh
!
poor
lad
!
He
's
been
spoiled
till
salt
wo
n't
save
*NL*
him
.
Mother
says
as
th
'
two
worst
things
as
can
happen
to
a
child
is
*NL*
never
to
have
his
own
way
--
or
always
to
have
it
.
She
does
n't
know
*NL*
which
is
th
'
worst
.
Tha
'
was
in
a
fine
temper
tha
`
self
,
too
.
But
he
*NL*
says
to
me
when
I
went
into
his
room
,
`
Please
ask
Miss
Mary
if
she
'll
*NL*
please
come
an
'
talk
to
me
?
'
Think
o
'
him
saying
please
!
Will
you
go
,
*NL*
Miss
?
''
``
I
'll
run
and
see
Dickon
first
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
No
,
I
'll
go
and
*NL*
see
Colin
first
and
tell
him
--
I
know
what
I
'll
tell
him
,
''
with
a
sudden
*NL*
inspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
her
hat
on
when
she
appeared
in
Colin
's
room
and
for
a
second
*NL*
he
looked
disappointed
.
He
was
in
bed
.
His
face
was
pitifully
white
*NL*
and
there
were
dark
circles
round
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
came
,
''
he
said
.
``
My
head
aches
and
I
ache
all
over
*NL*
because
I
'm
so
tired
.
Are
you
going
somewhere
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
went
and
leaned
against
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
be
long
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'm
going
to
Dickon
,
but
I
'll
come
back
.
*NL*
Colin
,
it
's
--
it
's
something
about
the
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
whole
face
brightened
and
a
little
color
came
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
is
it
?
''
he
cried
out
.
``
I
dreamed
about
it
all
night
I
heard
you
*NL*
say
something
about
gray
changing
into
green
,
and
I
dreamed
I
was
*NL*
standing
in
a
place
all
filled
with
trembling
little
green
leaves
--
and
*NL*
there
were
birds
on
nests
everywhere
and
they
looked
so
soft
and
still
.
*NL*
I
'll
lie
and
think
about
it
until
you
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
five
minutes
Mary
was
with
Dickon
in
their
garden
.
The
fox
and
the
*NL*
crow
were
with
him
again
and
this
time
he
had
brought
two
tame
*NL*
squirrels
.
``
I
came
over
on
the
pony
this
mornin
'
,
''
he
said
.
``
Eh
!
he
*NL*
is
a
good
little
chap
--
Jump
is
!
I
brought
these
two
in
my
pockets
.
*NL*
This
here
one
he
's
called
Nut
an
'
this
here
other
one
's
called
Shell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
said
``
Nut
''
one
squirrel
leaped
on
to
his
right
shoulder
and
*NL*
when
he
said
``
Shell
''
the
other
one
leaped
on
to
his
left
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
sat
down
on
the
grass
with
Captain
curled
at
their
feet
,
Soot
*NL*
solemnly
listening
on
a
tree
and
Nut
and
Shell
nosing
about
close
to
*NL*
them
,
it
seemed
to
Mary
that
it
would
be
scarcely
bearable
to
leave
*NL*
such
delightfulness
,
but
when
she
began
to
tell
her
story
somehow
the
*NL*
look
in
Dickon
's
funny
face
gradually
changed
her
mind
.
She
could
see
*NL*
he
felt
sorrier
for
Colin
than
she
did
.
He
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
*NL*
all
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
listen
to
them
birds
--
th
'
world
seems
full
of
'em
--
all
whistlin
'
*NL*
an
'
pipin

,
''
he
said
.
``
Look
at
'em
dartin
'
about
,
an
'
hearken
at
'em
*NL*
callin
'
to

Come
springtime
seems
like
as
if
all
th

*NL*
world
's
callin

.
The
leaves
is
uncurlin
'
so
you
can
see
'em
--
an
'
,
my
*NL*
word
,
th
'
nice
smells
there
is
about
!
''
sniffing
with
his
happy
*NL*
turned-up
nose
.
``
An
'
that
poor
lad
lyin
'
shut
up
an
'
seein
'
so
little
*NL*
that
he
gets
to

Eh

through
wi

sunshine
.
An
'
we
munnot
*NL*
lose
no
time
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
very
much
interested
he
often
spoke
quite
broad
Yorkshire
*NL*
though
at
other
times
he
tried
to
modify
his
dialect
so
that
Mary
could
*NL*
better
understand
.
But
she
loved
his
broad
Yorkshire
and
had
in
fact
*NL*
been
trying
to
learn
to
speak
it
herself
.
So
she
spoke
a
little
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
that
we
mun
,
''
she
said
-LRB-
which
meant
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
we
must
''
-RRB-
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
thee
what
us
'll
do
first
,
''
she
proceeded
,
and
Dickon
*NL*
grinned
,
because
when
the
little
wench
tried
to
twist
her
tongue
into
*NL*
speaking
Yorkshire
it
amused
him
very
much
.
``
He
's
took
a
graidely
*NL*
fancy
to
thee
.
He
wants
to
see
thee
and
he
wants
to
see
Soot
an
'
*NL*
Captain
.
When
I
go
back
to
the
house
to
talk
to
him
I
'll
ax
him
if
*NL*
tha
'
canna
'
come
an
'
see
him
tomorrow
mornin

an

tha

an

then

in
a

when

''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
stopped
she
was
quite
proud
of
herself
.
She
had
never
made
a
*NL*
long
speech
in
Yorkshire
before
and
she
had
remembered
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
mun
talk
a
bit
o

Yorkshire
like
that
to
Mester
Colin

Dickon
*NL*
chuckled
.
``

'll
make

's

as
good
for
ill
folk

fever

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
talk
Yorkshire
to
him
this
very
day
,
''
said
Mary
,
*NL*
chuckling
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
garden
had
reached
the
time
when
every
day
and
every
night
it
*NL*
seemed
as
if
Magicians
were
passing
through
it
drawing
loveliness
out
*NL*
of
the
earth
and
the
boughs
with
wands
.
It
was
hard
to
go
away
and
*NL*
leave
it
all
,
particularly
as
Nut
had
actually
crept
on
to
her
dress
*NL*
and
Shell
had
scrambled
down
the
trunk
of
the
apple-tree
they
sat
under
*NL*
and
stayed
there
looking
at
her
with
inquiring
eyes
.
But
she
went
back
*NL*
to
the
house
and
when
she
sat
down
close
to
Colin
's
bed
he
began
to
*NL*
sniff
as
Dickon
did
though
not
in
such
an
experienced
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
smell
like
flowers
and
--
and
fresh
things
,
''
he
cried
out
quite
*NL*
joyously
.
``
What
is
it
you
smell
of
?
It
's
cool
and
warm
and
sweet
all
*NL*
at
the
same
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
th
'
wind
from
th
'
moor
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
It
comes
o
'
sittin
'
on
th
'
*NL*
grass
under

tree
wi

Dickon

'
Captain

Soot
an

Nut
an

*NL*
Shell
.
It
's
th
'
springtime
an
'
out
o
'
doors
an
'
sunshine
as
smells
so
*NL*
graidely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
it
as
broadly
as
she
could
,
and
you
do
not
know
how
broadly
*NL*
Yorkshire
sounds
until
you
have
heard
some
one
speak
it
.
Colin
began
*NL*
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
never
heard
you
talk
like
that
*NL*
before
.
How
funny
it
sounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
givin
'
thee
a
bit
o
'
Yorkshire
,
''
answered
Mary
triumphantly
.
``
I
*NL*
canna
'
talk
as
graidely
as
Dickon
an
'
Martha
can
but
tha
'
sees
I
can

shape
a
bit

Does
n't
tha

understand

Yorkshire
when
tha

*NL*
hears
it

An

Eh

I
wonder
*NL*
tha
`
rt
not
ashamed
o

thy

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
she
began
to
laugh
too
and
they
both
laughed
until
they
could
*NL*
not
stop
themselves
and
they
laughed
until
the
room
echoed
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Medlock
opening
the
door
to
come
in
drew
back
into
the
corridor
and
*NL*
stood
listening
amazed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
upon
my
word
!
''
she
said
,
speaking
rather
broad
Yorkshire
herself
*NL*
because
there
was
no
one
to
hear
her
and
she
was
so
astonished
.
*NL*
``
Whoever
heard
th
'
like
!
Whoever
on
earth
would
ha
'
thought
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
so
much
to
talk
about
.
It
seemed
as
if
Colin
could
never
*NL*
hear
enough
of
Dickon
and
Captain
and
Soot
and
Nut
and
Shell
and
the
*NL*
pony
whose
name
was
Jump
.
Mary
had
run
round
into
the
wood
with
Dickon
*NL*
to
see
Jump
.
He
was
a
tiny
little
shaggy
moor
pony
with
thick
locks
*NL*
hanging
over
his
eyes
and
with
a
pretty
face
and
a
nuzzling
velvet
*NL*
nose
.
He
was
rather
thin
with
living
on
moor
grass
but
he
was
as
tough
*NL*
and
wiry
as
if
the
muscle
in
his
little
legs
had
been
made
of
steel
*NL*
springs
.
He
had
lifted
his
head
and
whinnied
softly
the
moment
he
saw
*NL*
Dickon
and
he
had
trotted
up
to
him
and
put
his
head
across
his
*NL*
shoulder
and
then
Dickon
had
talked
into
his
ear
and
Jump
had
talked
*NL*
back
in
odd
little
whinnies
and
puffs
and
snorts
.
Dickon
had
made
him
*NL*
give
Mary
his
small
front
hoof
and
kiss
her
on
her
cheek
with
his
*NL*
velvet
muzzle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
really
understand
everything
Dickon
says
?
''
Colin
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
as
if
he
does
,
''
answered
Mary
.
``
Dickon
says
anything
will
*NL*
understand
if
you
're
friends
with
it

sure

you
have
to
be
*NL*
friends
for
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
lay
quiet
a
little
while
and
his
strange
gray
eyes
seemed
to
be
*NL*
staring
at
the
wall
,
but
Mary
saw
he
was
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
was
friends
with
things
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
but
I
'm
not
.
I
*NL*
never
had
anything
to
be
friends
with
,
and
I
ca
n't
bear
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
bear
me
?
''
asked
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
can
,
''
he
answered
.
``
It
's
funny
but
I
even
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ben
Weatherstaff
said
I
was
like
him
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
He
said
he
'd
*NL*
warrant
we
'd
both
got
the
same
nasty
tempers
.
I
think
you
are
like
him
*NL*
too

We
are
all
three
alike
--
you
and
I
and
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
He
said
*NL*
we
were
neither
of
us
much
to
look
at
and
we
were
as
sour
as
we
looked
.
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
feel
as
sour
as
I
used
to
before
I
knew
the
robin
and
*NL*
Dickon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
feel
as
if
you
hated
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Mary
without
any
affectation
.
``
I
should
have
detested
*NL*
you
if
I
had
seen
you
before
I
saw
the
robin
and
Dickon

*NL*
*NL*
Colin
put
out
his
thin
hand
and
touched
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
wish
I
had
n't
said
what
I
did
about
sending
Dickon
*NL*
away
.
I
hated
you
when
you
said
he
was
like
an
angel
and
I
laughed
at
*NL*
you
but
--
but
perhaps
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
rather
funny
to
say
it
,
''
she
admitted
frankly
,
``
because
*NL*
his
nose
does
turn
up
and
he
has
a
big
mouth
and
his
clothes
have
*NL*
patches
all
over
them
and
he
talks
broad
Yorkshire
,
but
--
but
if
an
*NL*
angel
did
come
to
Yorkshire
and
live
on
the
moor
--
if
there
was
a
*NL*
Yorkshire
angel
--
I
believe
he
'd
understand
the
green
things
and
know
*NL*
how
to
make
them
grow
and
he
would
know
how
to
talk
to
the
wild
*NL*
creatures
as
Dickon
does
and
they
'd
know
he
was
friends
for
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
mind
Dickon
looking
at
me
,
''
said
Colin
;
``
I
want
to
see
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
said
that
,
''
answered
Mary
,
``
because
--
because
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
suddenly
it
came
into
her
mind
that
this
was
the
minute
to
tell
*NL*
him
.
Colin
knew
something
new
was
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
what
?
''
he
cried
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
so
anxious
that
she
got
up
from
her
stool
and
came
to
him
and
*NL*
caught
hold
of
both
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
trust
you
?
I
trusted
Dickon
because
birds
trusted
him
.
Can
I
*NL*
trust
you
--
for
sure
--
for
sure
?
''
she
implored
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
was
so
solemn
that
he
almost
whispered
his
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Dickon
will
come
to
see
you
tomorrow
morning
,
and
he
'll
bring
*NL*
his
creatures
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Oh
!
''
Colin
cried
out
in
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
not
all
,
''
Mary
went
on
,
almost
pale
with
solemn
excitement
.
*NL*
``
The
rest
is
better
.
There
is
a
door
into
the
garden
.
I
found
it
.
It
*NL*
is
under
the
ivy
on
the
wall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
had
been
a
strong
healthy
boy
Colin
would
probably
have
shouted
*NL*
``
Hooray
!
Hooray
!
Hooray
!
''
but
he
was
weak
and
rather
hysterical
;
his
*NL*
eyes
grew
bigger
and
bigger
and
he
gasped
for
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Mary
!
''
he
cried
out
with
a
half
sob
.
``
Shall
I
see
it
?
Shall
I
get
*NL*
into
it
?
Shall
I
live
to
get
into
it
?
''
and
he
clutched
her
hands
and
*NL*
dragged
her
toward
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
'll
see
it
!

snapped
Mary
indignantly
.
``
Of
course
you
'll
*NL*
live
to
get
into
it
!
Do
n't
be
silly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
was
so
un-hysterical
and
natural
and
childish
that
she
brought
*NL*
him
to
his
senses
and
he
began
to
laugh
at
himself
and
a
few
minutes
*NL*
afterward
she
was
sitting
on
her
stool
again
telling
him
not
what
she
*NL*
imagined
the
secret
garden
to
be
like
but
what
it
really
was
,
and
*NL*
Colin
's
aches
and
tiredness
were
forgotten
and
he
was
listening
*NL*
enraptured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
just
what
you
thought
it
would
be
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
It
sounds
*NL*
just
as
if
you
had
really
seen
it
.
You
know
I
said
that
when
you
told
*NL*
me
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
hesitated
about
two
minutes
and
then
boldly
spoke
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
seen
it
--
and
I
had
been
in
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
found
the
key
and
got
*NL*
in
weeks
ago
.
But
I
dare
n't
tell
you

I
dare
n't
because
I
was
so
*NL*
afraid
I
could
n't
trust
you

for
sure

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
``
IT
HAS
COME
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
Dr.
Craven
had
been
sent
for
the
morning
after
Colin
had
had
*NL*
his
tantrum
.
He
was
always
sent
for
at
once
when
such
a
thing
occurred
*NL*
and
he
always
found
,
when
he
arrived
,
a
white
shaken
boy
lying
on
his
*NL*
bed
,
sulky
and
still
so
hysterical
that
he
was
ready
to
break
into
*NL*
fresh
sobbing
at
the
least
word
.
In
fact
,
Dr.
Craven
dreaded
and
*NL*
detested
the
difficulties
of
these
visits
.
On
this
occasion
he
was
*NL*
away
from
Misselthwaite
Manor
until
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
he
?
''
he
asked
Mrs.
Medlock
rather
irritably
when
he
arrived
.
*NL*
``
He
will
break
a
blood-vessel
in
one
of
those
fits
some
day
.
The
boy
*NL*
is
half
insane
with
hysteria
and
self-indulgence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
answered
Mrs.
Medlock
,
``
you
'll
scarcely
believe
your
eyes
*NL*
when
you
see
him
.
That
plain
sour-faced
child
that
's
almost
as
bad
as
*NL*
himself
has
just
bewitched
him
.
How
she
's
done
it
there
's
no
telling
.
*NL*
The
Lord
knows
she
's
nothing
to
look
at
and
you
scarcely
ever
hear
her
*NL*
speak
,
but
she
did
what
none
of
us
dare
do
.
She
just
flew
at
him
like
*NL*
a
little
cat
last
night
,
and
stamped
her
feet
and
ordered
him
to
stop
*NL*
screaming
,
and
somehow
she
startled
him
so
that
he
actually
did
stop
,
*NL*
and
this
afternoon
--
well
just
come
up
and
see
,
sir
.
It
's
past
*NL*
crediting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
which
Dr.
Craven
beheld
when
he
entered
his
patient
's
room
*NL*
was
indeed
rather
astonishing
to
him
.
As
Mrs.
Medlock
opened
the
door
*NL*
he
heard
laughing
and
chattering
.
Colin
was
on
his
sofa
in
his
*NL*
dressing-gown
and
he
was
sitting
up
quite
straight
looking
at
a
picture
*NL*
in
one
of
the
garden
books
and
talking
to
the
plain
child
who
at
that
*NL*
moment
could
scarcely
be
called
plain
at
all
because
her
face
was
so
*NL*
glowing
with
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
long
spires
of
blue
ones
--
we
'll
have
a
lot
of
those
,
''
Colin
was
*NL*
announcing
.
``
They
're
called
Del-phin-iums
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dickon
says
they
're
larkspurs
made
big
and
grand
,
''
cried
Mistress
*NL*
Mary
.
``
There
are
clumps
there
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
saw
Dr.
Craven
and
stopped
.
Mary
became
quite
still
and
*NL*
Colin
looked
fretful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
hear
you
were
ill
last
night
,
my
boy
,
''
Dr.
Craven
said
a
*NL*
trifle
nervously
.
He
was
rather
a
nervous
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
better
now
--
much
better
,
''
Colin
answered
,
rather
like
a
Rajah
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
out
in
my
chair
in
a
day
or
two
if
it
is
fine
.
I
want
some
*NL*
fresh
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Craven
sat
down
by
him
and
felt
his
pulse
and
looked
at
him
*NL*
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
a
very
fine
day
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
you
must
be
very
careful
*NL*
not
to
tire
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fresh
air
wo
n't
tire
me
,
''
said
the
young
Rajah
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
there
had
been
occasions
when
this
same
young
gentleman
had
shrieked
*NL*
aloud
with
rage
and
had
insisted
that
fresh
air
would
give
him
cold
and
*NL*
kill
him
,
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
his
doctor
felt
somewhat
*NL*
startled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
did
not
like
fresh
air
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
when
I
am
by
myself
,
''
replied
the
Rajah
;
``
but
my
cousin
is
*NL*
going
out
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
nurse
,
of
course
?
''
suggested
Dr.
Craven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
will
not
have
the
nurse
,
''
so
magnificently
that
Mary
could
not
*NL*
help
remembering
how
the
young
native
Prince
had
looked
with
his
*NL*
diamonds
and
emeralds
and
pearls
stuck
all
over
him
and
the
great
*NL*
rubies
on
the
small
dark
hand
he
had
waved
to
command
his
servants
to
*NL*
approach
with
salaams
and
receive
his
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cousin
knows
how
to
take
care
of
me
.
I
am
always
better
when
she
*NL*
is
with
me
.
She
made
me
better
last
night
.
A
very
strong
boy
I
know
*NL*
will
push
my
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Craven
felt
rather
alarmed
.
If
this
tiresome
hysterical
boy
should
*NL*
chance
to
get
well
he
himself
would
lose
all
chance
of
inheriting
*NL*
Misselthwaite
;
but
he
was
not
an
unscrupulous
man
,
though
he
was
a
weak
*NL*
one
,
and
he
did
not
intend
to
let
him
run
into
actual
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
be
a
strong
boy
and
a
steady
boy
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
I
must
know
*NL*
something
about
him
.
Who
is
he
?
What
is
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Dickon
,
''
Mary
spoke
up
suddenly
.
She
felt
somehow
that
everybody
*NL*
who
knew
the
moor
must
know
Dickon
.
And
she
was
right
,
too
.
She
saw
*NL*
that
in
a
moment
Dr.
Craven
's
serious
face
relaxed
into
a
relieved
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Dickon
,
''
he
said
.
``
If
it
is
Dickon
you
will
be
safe
enough
.
He
's
*NL*
as
strong
as
a
moor
pony
,
is
Dickon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
's
trusty
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
He
's
th
'
trustiest
lad
i
'
Yorkshire
.
''
*NL*
She
had
been
talking
Yorkshire
to
Colin
and
she
forgot
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Dickon
teach
you
that
?
''
asked
Dr.
Craven
,
laughing
outright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
learning
it
as
if
it
was
French
,
''
said
Mary
rather
coldly
.
``
It
's
*NL*
like
a
native
dialect
in
India
.
Very
clever
people
try
to
learn
them
.
*NL*
I
like
it
and
so
does
Colin
.
''
``
Well
,
well
,
''
he
said
.
``
If
it
amuses
you
*NL*
perhaps
it
wo
n't
do
you
any
harm
.
Did
you
take
your
bromide
last
*NL*
night
,
Colin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
Colin
answered
.
``
I
would
n't
take
it
at
first
and
after
Mary
made
*NL*
me
quiet
she
talked
me
to
sleep
--
in
a
low
voice
--
about
the
spring
*NL*
creeping
into
a
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
sounds
soothing
,
''
said
Dr.
Craven
,
more
perplexed
than
ever
and
*NL*
glancing
sideways
at
Mistress
Mary
sitting
on
her
stool
and
looking
*NL*
down
silently
at
the
carpet
.
``
You
are
evidently
better
,
but
you
must
*NL*
remember
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
remember
,
''
interrupted
the
Rajah
,
appearing
again
.
*NL*
``
When
I
lie
by
myself
and
remember
I
begin
to
have
pains
everywhere
and
*NL*
I
think
of
things
that
make
me
begin
to
scream
because
I
hate
them
so
.
*NL*
If
there
was
a
doctor
anywhere
who
could
make
you
forget
you
were
ill
*NL*
instead
of
remembering
it
I
would
have
him
brought
here
.
''
And
he
waved
*NL*
a
thin
hand
which
ought
really
to
have
been
covered
with
royal
signet
*NL*
rings
made
of
rubies
.
``
It
is
because
my
cousin
makes
me
forget
that
*NL*
she
makes
me
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Craven
had
never
made
such
a
short
stay
after
a
``
tantrum
''
;
usually
*NL*
he
was
obliged
to
remain
a
very
long
time
and
do
a
great
many
things
.
*NL*
This
afternoon
he
did
not
give
any
medicine
or
leave
any
new
orders
and
*NL*
he
was
spared
any
disagreeable
scenes
.
When
he
went
downstairs
he
*NL*
looked
very
thoughtful
and
when
he
talked
to
Mrs.
Medlock
in
the
*NL*
library
she
felt
that
he
was
a
much
puzzled
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
she
ventured
,
``
could
you
have
believed
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
certainly
a
new
state
of
affairs
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
And
*NL*
there
's
no
denying
it
is
better
than

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

I

said
Mrs.
Medlock
.
``
I
*NL*
stopped
in
her
cottage
on
my

to
Thwaite
yesterday

had
a

And
she
says

Well

We
went

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
the
best
sick
nurse
I

said
Dr.
Craven
.
``
When
I
find
her
*NL*
in
a
cottage
I
know
the
chances
are
that
I
shall
save
my
patient

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Medlock
smiled
.
She
was
fond
of
Susan
Sowerby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
got
a
way
with
her
,
has
Susan
,
''
she
went
on
quite
volubly
.
*NL*
``
I
've
been
thinking
all
morning
of
one
thing
she
said
yesterday
.
She
*NL*
says
,
`
Once
when
I
was
givin
'
th
'
children
a
bit
of
a
preach
after
*NL*
they
'd
been
fightin
'
I
ses
to
'em
all
,
``
When
I
was
at
school
my
*NL*
jography
told
as
th
'
world
was
shaped
like
a
orange
an
'
I
found
out
*NL*
before
I
was
ten
that
th
'
whole
orange
does
n't
belong
to
nobody
.
No
*NL*
one
owns
more
than
his
bit
of
a
quarter
an
'
there
's
times
it
seems
like
*NL*
there
's
not
enow
quarters
to
go
round

But
do
n't
you
--
none
o

*NL*
you
--
think
as
you
own
th

whole
orange
or
you
'll
find
out
you

*NL*
mistaken
,
an
'
you
wo
n't
find
it
out
without
hard
knocks

''
`
What
*NL*
children
learns
from
children
,
'
she
says
,
`
is
that
there
's
no
sense
in
*NL*
grabbin

at
th

whole
orange

peel

If
you

you
'll
likely
*NL*
not
get
even
th

an

them
's
too
bitter
to
eat

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
shrewd
woman
,
''
said
Dr.
Craven
,
putting
on
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
's
got
a
way
of
saying
things
,

ended
Mrs.
Medlock
,
much
*NL*
pleased
.
``
Sometimes
I
've
said
to
her
,
`
Eh

Susan
,
if

was
a
*NL*
different

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
Colin
slept
without
once
awakening
and
when
he
opened
his
*NL*
eyes
in
the
morning
he
lay
still
and
smiled
without
knowing
it
--
smiled
*NL*
because
he
felt
so
curiously
comfortable
.
It
was
actually
nice
to
be
*NL*
awake
,
and
he
turned
over
and
stretched
his
limbs
luxuriously
.
He
felt
*NL*
as
if
tight
strings
which
had
held
him
had
loosened
themselves
and
let
*NL*
him
go
.
He
did
not
know
that
Dr.
Craven
would
have
said
that
his
*NL*
nerves
had
relaxed
and
rested
themselves
.
Instead
of
lying
and
staring
*NL*
at
the
wall
and
wishing
he
had
not
awakened
,
his
mind
was
full
of
the
*NL*
plans
he
and
Mary
had
made
yesterday
,
of
pictures
of
the
garden
and
of
*NL*
Dickon
and
his
wild
creatures
.
It
was
so
nice
to
have
things
to
think
*NL*
about
.
And
he
had
not
been
awake
more
than
ten
minutes
when
he
heard
*NL*
feet
running
along
the
corridor
and
Mary
was
at
the
door
.
The
next
*NL*
minute
she
was
in
the
room
and
had
run
across
to
his
bed
,
bringing
with
*NL*
her
a
waft
of
fresh
air
full
of
the
scent
of
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
out
!
You
've
been
out
!
There
's
that
nice
smell
of
leaves
!
''
*NL*
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
running
and
her
hair
was
loose
and
blown
and
she
was
*NL*
bright
with
the
air
and
pink-cheeked
,
though
he
could
not
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
beautiful
!
''
she
said
,
a
little
breathless
with
her
speed
.
*NL*
``
You
never
saw
anything
so
beautiful
!
It
has
come
!
I
thought
it
had
*NL*
come
that
other
morning
,
but
it
was
only
coming
.
It
is
here
now
!
It
*NL*
has
come
,
the
Spring
!
Dickon
says
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
it
?
''
cried
Colin
,
and
though
he
really
knew
nothing
about
it
he
*NL*
felt
his
heart
beat
.
He
actually
sat
up
in
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Open
the
window
!
''
he
added
,
laughing
half
with
joyful
excitement
and
*NL*
half
at
his
own
fancy
.
``
Perhaps
we
may
hear
golden
trumpets
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
though
he
laughed
,
Mary
was
at
the
window
in
a
moment
and
in
a
*NL*
moment
more
it
was
opened
wide
and
freshness
and
softness
and
scents
*NL*
and
birds
'
songs
were
pouring
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
fresh
air
,
''
she
said
.
``
Lie
on
your
back
and
draw
in
long
*NL*
breaths
of
it
.
That
's
what
Dickon
does
when
he
's
lying
on
the
moor
.
*NL*
He
says
he
feels
it
in
his
veins
and
it
makes
him
strong
and
he
feels
*NL*
as
if
he
could
live
forever
and
ever
.
Breathe
it
and
breathe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
only
repeating
what
Dickon
had
told
her
,
but
she
caught
Colin
's
*NL*
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Forever
and
ever
'
!
Does
it
make
him
feel
like
that
?
''
he
said
,
and
he
*NL*
did
as
she
told
him
,
drawing
in
long
deep
breaths
over
and
over
again
*NL*
until
he
felt
that
something
quite
new
and
delightful
was
happening
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
at
his
bedside
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
are
crowding
up
out
of
the
earth
,
''
she
ran
on
in
a
hurry
.
``
And
*NL*
there
are
flowers
uncurling
and
buds
on
everything
and
the
green
veil
*NL*
has
covered
nearly
all
the
gray
and
the
birds
are
in
such
a
hurry
about
*NL*
their
nests
for
fear
they
may
be
too
late
that
some
of
them
are
even
*NL*
fighting
for
places
in
the
secret
garden
.
And
the
rose-bushes
look
as
*NL*
wick
as
wick
can
be
,
and
there
are
primroses
in
the
lanes
and
woods
,
*NL*
and
the
seeds
we
planted
are
up
,
and
Dickon
has
brought
the
fox
and
the
*NL*
crow
and
the
squirrels
and
a
new-born
lamb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
she
paused
for
breath
.
The
new-born
lamb
Dickon
had
found
*NL*
three
days
before
lying
by
its
dead
mother
among
the
gorse
bushes
on
*NL*
the
moor
.
It
was
not
the
first
motherless
lamb
he
had
found
and
he
*NL*
knew
what
to
do
with
it
.
He
had
taken
it
to
the
cottage
wrapped
in
his
*NL*
jacket
and
he
had
let
it
lie
near
the
fire
and
had
fed
it
with
warm
*NL*
milk
.
It
was
a
soft
thing
with
a
darling
silly
baby
face
and
legs
*NL*
rather
long
for
its
body
.
Dickon
had
carried
it
over
the
moor
in
his
*NL*
arms
and
its
feeding
bottle
was
in
his
pocket
with
a
squirrel
,
and
when
*NL*
Mary
had
sat
under
a
tree
with
its
limp
warmness
huddled
on
her
lap
she
*NL*
had
felt
as
if
she
were
too
full
of
strange
joy
to
speak
.
A
lamb
--
a
*NL*
lamb
!
A
living
lamb
who
lay
on
your
lap
like
a
baby
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
describing
it
with
great
joy
and
Colin
was
listening
and
*NL*
drawing
in
long
breaths
of
air
when
the
nurse
entered
.
She
started
a
*NL*
little
at
the
sight
of
the
open
window
.
She
had
sat
stifling
in
the
*NL*
room
many
a
warm
day
because
her
patient
was
sure
that
open
windows
*NL*
gave
people
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
you
are
not
chilly
,
Master
Colin
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
was
the
answer
.
``
I
am
breathing
long
breaths
of
fresh
air
.
It
*NL*
makes
you
strong
.
I
am
going
to
get
up
to
the
sofa
for
breakfast
.
My
*NL*
cousin
will
have
breakfast
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
went
away
,
concealing
a
smile
,
to
give
the
order
for
two
*NL*
breakfasts
.
She
found
the
servants
'
hall
a
more
amusing
place
than
the
*NL*
invalid
's
chamber
and
just
now
everybody
wanted
to
hear
the
news
from
*NL*
upstairs
.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
joking
about
the
unpopular
young
*NL*
recluse
who
,
as
the
cook
said
,
``
had
found
his
master
,
and
good
for
*NL*
him
.
''
The
servants
'
hall
had
been
very
tired
of
the
tantrums
,
and
the
*NL*
butler
,
who
was
a
man
with
a
family
,
had
more
than
once
expressed
his
*NL*
opinion
that
the
invalid
would
be
all
the
better
``
for
a
good
hiding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Colin
was
on
his
sofa
and
the
breakfast
for
two
was
put
upon
the
*NL*
table
he
made
an
announcement
to
the
nurse
in
his
most
Rajah-like
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
boy
,
and
a
fox
,
and
a
crow
,
and
two
squirrels
,
and
a
new-born
lamb
,
*NL*
are
coming
to
see
me
this
morning
.
I
want
them
brought
upstairs
as
*NL*
soon
as
they
come
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
are
not
to
begin
playing
with
the
*NL*
animals
in
the
servants
'
hall
and
keep
them
there
.
I
want
them
here
.
''
*NL*
The
nurse
gave
a
slight
gasp
and
tried
to
conceal
it
with
a
cough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
you
can
do
,
''
added
Colin
,
waving
his
hand
.
``
You
*NL*
can
tell
Martha
to
bring
them
here
.
The
boy
is
Martha
's
brother
.
His
*NL*
name
is
Dickon
and
he
is
an
animal
charmer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
the
animals
wo
n't
bite
,
Master
Colin
,
''
said
the
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
he
was
a
charmer
,
''
said
Colin
austerely
.
``
Charmers
'
*NL*
animals
never
bite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
snake-charmers
in
India
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
And
they
can
put
*NL*
their
snakes
'
heads
in
their
mouths
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
!
''
shuddered
the
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
ate
their
breakfast
with
the
morning
air
pouring
in
upon
them
.
*NL*
Colin
's
breakfast
was
a
very
good
one
and
Mary
watched
him
with
serious
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
begin
to
get
fatter
just
as
I
did
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
never
*NL*
wanted
my
breakfast
when
I
was
in
India
and
now
I
always
want
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
mine
this
morning
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
Perhaps
it
was
the
fresh
*NL*
air
.
When
do
you
think
Dickon
will
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
long
in
coming
.
In
about
ten
minutes
Mary
held
up
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
''
she
said
.
``
Did
you
hear
a
caw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
listened
and
heard
it
,
the
oddest
sound
in
the
world
to
hear
*NL*
inside
a
house
,
a
hoarse
``
caw-caw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Soot
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
Listen
again
.
Do
you
hear
a
bleat
--
a
tiny
*NL*
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
cried
Colin
,
quite
flushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
new-born
lamb
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
He
's
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
's
moorland
boots
were
thick
and
clumsy
and
though
he
tried
to
*NL*
walk
quietly
they
made
a
clumping
sound
as
he
walked
through
the
long
*NL*
corridors
.
Mary
and
Colin
heard
him
marching
--
marching
,
until
he
*NL*
passed
through
the
tapestry
door
on
to
the
soft
carpet
of
Colin
's
own
*NL*
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
sir
,
''
announced
Martha
,
opening
the
door
,
``
if
you
*NL*
please
,
sir
,
here
's
Dickon
an
'
his
creatures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
came
in
smiling
his
nicest
wide
smile
.
The
new-born
lamb
was
in
*NL*
his
arms
and
the
little
red
fox
trotted
by
his
side
.
Nut
sat
on
his
*NL*
left
shoulder
and
Soot
on
his
right
and
Shell
's
head
and
paws
peeped
*NL*
out
of
his
coat
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
slowly
sat
up
and
stared
and
stared
--
as
he
had
stared
when
he
*NL*
first
saw
Mary
;
but
this
was
a
stare
of
wonder
and
delight
.
The
truth
*NL*
was
that
in
spite
of
all
he
had
heard
he
had
not
in
the
least
*NL*
understood
what
this
boy
would
be
like
and
that
his
fox
and
his
crow
*NL*
and
his
squirrels
and
his
lamb
were
so
near
to
him
and
his
friendliness
*NL*
that
they
seemed
almost
to
be
part
of
himself
.
Colin
had
never
talked
*NL*
to
a
boy
in
his
life
and
he
was
so
overwhelmed
by
his
own
pleasure
and
*NL*
curiosity
that
he
did
not
even
think
of
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dickon
did
not
feel
the
least
shy
or
awkward
.
He
had
not
felt
*NL*
embarrassed
because
the
crow
had
not
known
his
language
and
had
only
*NL*
stared
and
had
not
spoken
to
him
the
first
time
they
met
.
Creatures
*NL*
were
always
like
that
until
they
found
out
about
you
.
He
walked
over
*NL*
to
Colin
's
sofa
and
put
the
new-born
lamb
quietly
on
his
lap
,
and
*NL*
immediately
the
little
creature
turned
to
the
warm
velvet
dressing-gown
*NL*
and
began
to
nuzzle
and
nuzzle
into
its
folds
and
butt
its
tight-curled
*NL*
head
with
soft
impatience
against
his
side
.
Of
course
no
boy
could
*NL*
have
helped
speaking
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
doing
?
''
cried
Colin
.
``
What
does
it
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wants
its
mother
,
''
said
Dickon
,
smiling
more
and
more
.
``
I
brought
*NL*
it
to
thee
a
bit
hungry
because
I
knowed
tha
'd
like
to
see
it
feed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
knelt
down
by
the
sofa
and
took
a
feeding-bottle
from
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
little
`
un
,
''
he
said
,
turning
the
small
woolly
white
head
*NL*
with
a
gentle
brown
hand
.
``
This
is
what
tha
's
after
.
Tha
'll
get
more
*NL*
out
o
'
this
than
tha
'
will
out
o
'
silk
velvet
coats
.
There
now
,
''
and
*NL*
he
pushed
the
rubber
tip
of
the
bottle
into
the
nuzzling
mouth
and
the
*NL*
lamb
began
to
suck
it
with
ravenous
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
there
was
no
wondering
what
to
say
.
By
the
time
the
lamb
*NL*
fell
asleep
questions
poured
forth
and
Dickon
answered
them
all
.
He
*NL*
told
them
how
he
had
found
the
lamb
just
as
the
sun
was
rising
three
*NL*
mornings
ago
.
He
had
been
standing
on
the
moor
listening
to
a
skylark
*NL*
and
watching
him
swing
higher
and
higher
into
the
sky
until
he
was
only
*NL*
a
speck
in
the
heights
of
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
almost
lost
him
but
for
his
song
an
'
I
was
wonderin
'
how
a
chap
*NL*
could
hear
it
when
it
seemed
as
if
he
'd
get
out
o
'
th
'
world
in
a
*NL*
minute
--
an
'
just
then
I
heard
somethin'
else
far
off
among
th
'
gorse
*NL*
bushes
.
It
was
a
weak
bleatin
'
an
'
I
knowed
it
was
a
new
lamb
as
was
*NL*
hungry
an
'
I
knowed
it
would
n't
be
hungry
if
it
had
n't
lost
its
mother
*NL*
somehow
,
so
I
set
off
searchin
'
.
Eh
!
I
did
have
a
look
for
it
.
I
went
*NL*
in
an
'
out
among
th
'
gorse
bushes
an
'
round
an
'
round
an
'
I
always
*NL*
seemed
to
take
th
'
wrong
turnin
'
.
But
at
last
I
seed
a
bit
o
'
white
by
*NL*
a
rock
on
top
o
'
th
'
moor
an
'
I
climbed
up
an
'
found
th
'
little
`
un
*NL*
half
dead
wi
'
cold
an
'
clemmin
'
.
''
While
he
talked
,
Soot
flew
solemnly
*NL*
in
and
out
of
the
open
window
and
cawed
remarks
about
the
scenery
while
*NL*
Nut
and
Shell
made
excursions
into
the
big
trees
outside
and
ran
up
and
*NL*
down
trunks
and
explored
branches
.
Captain
curled
up
near
Dickon
,
who
*NL*
sat
on
the
hearth-rug
from
preference
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
the
pictures
in
the
gardening
books
and
Dickon
knew
all
*NL*
the
flowers
by
their
country
names
and
knew
exactly
which
ones
were
*NL*
already
growing
in
the
secret
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
couldna
'
say
that
there
name
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
one
under
which
*NL*
was
written
``
Aquilegia
,
''
``
but
us
calls
that
a
columbine
,
an

that

There

some

They

when

're
out

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going

cried
Colin
.
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
SHALL
LIVE
FOREVER
--
AND
EVER
--
AND
EVER
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
were
obliged
to
wait
more
than
a
week
because
first
there
came
*NL*
some
very
windy
days
and
then
Colin
was
threatened
with
a
cold
,
which
*NL*
two
things
happening
one
after
the
other
would
no
doubt
have
thrown
him
*NL*
into
a
rage
but
that
there
was
so
much
careful
and
mysterious
planning
*NL*
to
do
and
almost
every
day
Dickon
came
in
,
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
,
*NL*
to
talk
about
what
was
happening
on
the
moor
and
in
the
lanes
and
*NL*
hedges
and
on
the
borders
of
streams
.
The
things
he
had
to
tell
about
*NL*
otters
'
and
badgers
'
and
water-rats
'
houses
,
not
to
mention
birds
'
*NL*
nests
and
field-mice
and
their
burrows
,
were
enough
to
make
you
almost
*NL*
tremble
with
excitement
when
you
heard
all
the
intimate
details
from
an
*NL*
animal
charmer
and
realized
with
what
thrilling
eagerness
and
anxiety
*NL*
the
whole
busy
underworld
was
working
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
same
as
us
,
''
said
Dickon
,
``
only
they
have
to
build
their
homes
*NL*
every
year
.
An
'
it
keeps
'em
so
busy
they
fair
scuffle
to
get
'em
*NL*
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
absorbing
thing
,
however
,
was
the
preparations
to
be
made
*NL*
before
Colin
could
be
transported
with
sufficient
secrecy
to
the
*NL*
garden
.
No
one
must
see
the
chair-carriage
and
Dickon
and
Mary
after
*NL*
they
turned
a
certain
corner
of
the
shrubbery
and
entered
upon
the
walk
*NL*
outside
the
ivied
walls
.
As
each
day
passed
,
Colin
had
become
more
and
*NL*
more
fixed
in
his
feeling
that
the
mystery
surrounding
the
garden
was
*NL*
one
of
its
greatest
charms
.
Nothing
must
spoil
that
.
No
one
must
ever
*NL*
suspect
that
they
had
a
secret
.
People
must
think
that
he
was
simply
*NL*
going
out
with
Mary
and
Dickon
because
he
liked
them
and
did
not
object
*NL*
to
their
looking
at
him
.
They
had
long
and
quite
delightful
talks
*NL*
about
their
route
.
They
would
go
up
this
path
and
down
that
one
and
*NL*
cross
the
other
and
go
round
among
the
fountain
flower-beds
as
if
they
*NL*
were
looking
at
the
``
bedding-out
plants
''
the
head
gardener
,
Mr.
Roach
,
*NL*
had
been
having
arranged
.
That
would
seem
such
a
rational
thing
to
do
*NL*
that
no
one
would
think
it
at
all
mysterious
.
They
would
turn
into
the
*NL*
shrubbery
walks
and
lose
themselves
until
they
came
to
the
long
walls
.
*NL*
It
was
almost
as
serious
and
elaborately
thought
out
as
the
plans
of
*NL*
march
made
by
great
generals
in
time
of
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rumors
of
the
new
and
curious
things
which
were
occurring
in
the
*NL*
invalid
's
apartments
had
of
course
filtered
through
the
servants
'
hall
*NL*
into
the
stable
yards
and
out
among
the
gardeners
,
but
notwithstanding
*NL*
this
,
Mr.
Roach
was
startled
one
day
when
he
received
orders
from
*NL*
Master
Colin
's
room
to
the
effect
that
he
must
report
himself
in
the
*NL*
apartment
no
outsider
had
ever
seen
,
as
the
invalid
himself
desired
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
he
said
to
himself
as
he
hurriedly
changed
his
coat
,
*NL*
``
what
's
to
do
now
?
His
Royal
Highness
that
was
n't
to
be
looked
at
*NL*
calling
up
a
man
he
's
never
set
eyes
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Roach
was
not
without
curiosity
.
He
had
never
caught
even
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
the
boy
and
had
heard
a
dozen
exaggerated
stories
about
his
*NL*
uncanny
looks
and
ways
and
his
insane
tempers
.
The
thing
he
had
heard
*NL*
oftenest
was
that
he
might
die
at
any
moment
and
there
had
been
*NL*
numerous
fanciful
descriptions
of
a
humped
back
and
helpless
limbs
,
*NL*
given
by
people
who
had
never
seen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
are
changing
in
this
house
,
Mr.
Roach
,
''
said
Mrs.
Medlock
,
as
*NL*
she
led
him
up
the
back
staircase
to
the
corridor
on
to
which
opened
*NL*
the
hitherto
mysterious
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
hope
they
're
changing
for
the
better
,
Mrs.
Medlock
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
could
n't
well
change
for
the
worse
,
''
she
continued
;
``
and
queer
as
*NL*
it
all
is
there
's
them
as
finds
their
duties
made
a
lot
easier
to
stand
*NL*
up
under
.
Do
n't
you
be
surprised
,
Mr.
Roach
,
if
you
find
yourself
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
a
menagerie
and
Martha
Sowerby
's
Dickon
more
at
home
than
*NL*
you
or
me
could
ever
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
really
was
a
sort
of
Magic
about
Dickon
,
as
Mary
always
privately
*NL*
believed
.
When
Mr.
Roach
heard
his
name
he
smiled
quite
leniently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'd
be
at
home
in
Buckingham
Palace
or
at
the
bottom
of
a
coal
mine
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
And
yet
it
's
not
impudence
,
either
.
He
's
just
fine
,
is
that
*NL*
lad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
perhaps
well
he
had
been
prepared
or
he
might
have
been
*NL*
startled
.
When
the
bedroom
door
was
opened
a
large
crow
,
which
seemed
*NL*
quite
at
home
perched
on
the
high
back
of
a
carven
chair
,
announced
the
*NL*
entrance
of
a
visitor
by
saying
``
Caw
--
Caw
''
quite
loudly
.
In
spite
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Medlock
's
warning
,
Mr.
Roach
only
just
escaped
being
sufficiently
*NL*
undignified
to
jump
backward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Rajah
was
neither
in
bed
nor
on
his
sofa
.
He
was
sitting
in
*NL*
an
armchair
and
a
young
lamb
was
standing
by
him
shaking
its
tail
in
*NL*
feeding-lamb
fashion
as
Dickon
knelt
giving
it
milk
from
its
bottle
.
A
*NL*
squirrel
was
perched
on
Dickon
's
bent
back
attentively
nibbling
a
nut
.
*NL*
The
little
girl
from
India
was
sitting
on
a
big
footstool
looking
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
Mr.
Roach
,
Master
Colin
,
''
said
Mrs.
Medlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Rajah
turned
and
looked
his
servitor
over
--
at
least
that
was
*NL*
what
the
head
gardener
felt
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
Roach
,
are
you
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
sent
for
you
to
give
you
*NL*
some
very
important
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
sir
,
''
answered
Roach
,
wondering
if
he
was
to
receive
*NL*
instructions
to
fell
all
the
oaks
in
the
park
or
to
transform
the
*NL*
orchards
into
water-gardens
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
out
in
my
chair
this
afternoon
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
If
the
fresh
*NL*
air
agrees
with
me
I
may
go
out
every
day
.
When
I
go
,
none
of
the
*NL*
gardeners
are
to
be
anywhere
near
the
Long
Walk
by
the
garden
walls
.
*NL*
No
one
is
to
be
there
.
I
shall
go
out
about
two
o'clock
and
everyone
*NL*
must
keep
away
until
I
send
word
that
they
may
go
back
to
their
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
sir
,
''
replied
Mr.
Roach
,
much
relieved
to
hear
that
the
*NL*
oaks
might
remain
and
that
the
orchards
were
safe
.
``
Mary
,
''
said
Colin
,
*NL*
turning
to
her
,
``
what
is
that
thing
you
say
in
India
when
you
have
*NL*
finished
talking
and
want
people
to
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
,
`
You
have
my
permission
to
go
,

''
answered
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rajah
waved
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
my
permission
to
go
,
Roach
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
,
remember
,
this
*NL*
is
very
important
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caw
--
Caw
!
''
remarked
the
crow
hoarsely
but
not
impolitely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
sir
.
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Roach
,
and
Mrs.
Medlock
*NL*
took
him
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
in
the
corridor
,
being
a
rather
good-natured
man
,
he
smiled
*NL*
until
he
almost
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
!
''
he
said
,
``
he
's
got
a
fine
lordly
way
with
him
,
has
n't
he
?
*NL*
You
'd
think
he
was
a
whole
Royal
Family
rolled
into
one
--
Prince
Consort
*NL*
and
all
.
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
protested
Mrs.
Medlock
,
``
we
've
had
to
let
him
trample
all
over
*NL*
every
one
of
us
ever
since
he
had
feet
and
he
thinks
that
's
what
folks
*NL*
was
born
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
'll
grow
out
of
it
,
if
he
lives
,
''
suggested
Mr.
Roach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
's
one
thing
pretty
sure
,
''
said
Mrs.
Medlock
.
``
If
he
does
*NL*
live
and
that
Indian
child
stays
here
I
'll
warrant
she
teaches
him
that
*NL*
the
whole
orange
does
not
belong
to
him
,
as
Susan
Sowerby
says
.
And
*NL*
he
'll
be
likely
to
find
out
the
size
of
his
own
quarter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Inside
the
room
Colin
was
leaning
back
on
his
cushions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
safe
now
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
this
afternoon
I
shall
see
it
--
this
*NL*
afternoon
I
shall
be
in
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
went
back
to
the
garden
with
his
creatures
and
Mary
stayed
with
*NL*
Colin
.
She
did
not
think
he
looked
tired
but
he
was
very
quiet
before
*NL*
their
lunch
came
and
he
was
quiet
while
they
were
eating
it
.
She
*NL*
wondered
why
and
asked
him
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
big
eyes
you
've
got
,
Colin
,
''
she
said
.
``
When
you
are
thinking
*NL*
they
get
as
big
as
saucers

What
are
you
thinking
about
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
about
what
it
will
look
like

he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
garden
?
''
asked
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
springtime
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
was
thinking
that
I

really
never
seen
*NL*
it
before
.
I
scarcely
ever
went
out
and
when
I
did
go
I
never
looked
*NL*
at
it
.
I
did
n't
even
think
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
it
in
India
because
there
was
n't
any
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shut
in
and
morbid
as
his
life
had
been
,
Colin
had
more
imagination
*NL*
than
she
had
and
at
least
he
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
looking
at
*NL*
wonderful
books
and
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
morning
when
you
ran
in
and
said
`
It
's
come
!
It
's
come
!
'
,
you
made
*NL*
me
feel
quite
queer
.
It
sounded
as
if
things
were
coming
with
a
great
*NL*
procession
and
big
bursts
and
wafts
of
music
.
I
've
a
picture
like
it
*NL*
in
one
of
my
books
--
crowds
of
lovely
people
and
children
with
garlands
*NL*
and
branches
with
blossoms
on
them
,
everyone
laughing
and
dancing
and
*NL*
crowding
and
playing
on
pipes
.
That
was
why
I
said
,
`
Perhaps
we
shall
*NL*
hear
golden
trumpets
'
and
told
you
to
throw
open
the
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
funny
!
''
said
Mary
.
``
That
's
really
just
what
it
feels
like
.
And
*NL*
if
all
the
flowers
and
leaves
and
green
things
and
birds
and
wild
*NL*
creatures
danced
past
at
once
,
what
a
crowd
it
would
be
!
I
'm
sure
*NL*
they
'd
dance
and
sing
and
flute
and
that
would
be
the
wafts
of
music
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
laughed
but
it
was
not
because
the
idea
was
laughable
but
*NL*
because
they
both
so
liked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
later
the
nurse
made
Colin
ready
.
She
noticed
that
instead
of
*NL*
lying
like
a
log
while
his
clothes
were
put
on
he
sat
up
and
made
some
*NL*
efforts
to
help
himself
,
and
he
talked
and
laughed
with
Mary
all
the
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
one
of
his
good
days
,
sir
,
''
she
said
to
Dr.
Craven
,
who
*NL*
dropped
in
to
inspect
him
.
``
He
's
in
such
good
spirits
that
it
makes
*NL*
him
stronger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
call
in
again
later
in
the
afternoon
,
after
he
has
come
in
,
''
said
*NL*
Dr.
Craven
.
``
I
must
see
how
the
going
out
agrees
with
him
.
I
wish
,
''
*NL*
in
a
very
low
voice
,
``
that
he
would
let
you
go
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
give
up
the
case
this
moment
,
sir
,
than
even
stay
here
*NL*
while
it
's
suggested
,
''
answered
the
nurse
.
With
sudden
firmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
n't
really
decided
to
suggest
it
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
with
his
*NL*
slight
nervousness
.
``
We
'll
try
the
experiment
.
Dickon
's
a
lad
I
'd
*NL*
trust
with
a
new-born
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
strongest
footman
in
the
house
carried
Colin
down
stairs
and
put
*NL*
him
in
his
wheeled
chair
near
which
Dickon
waited
outside
.
After
the
*NL*
manservant
had
arranged
his
rugs
and
cushions
the
Rajah
waved
his
hand
*NL*
to
him
and
to
the
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
my
permission
to
go
,
''
he
said
,
and
they
both
disappeared
*NL*
quickly
and
it
must
be
confessed
giggled
when
they
were
safely
inside
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
began
to
push
the
wheeled
chair
slowly
and
steadily
.
Mistress
*NL*
Mary
walked
beside
it
and
Colin
leaned
back
and
lifted
his
face
to
the
*NL*
sky
.
The
arch
of
it
looked
very
high
and
the
small
snowy
clouds
seemed
*NL*
like
white
birds
floating
on
outspread
wings
below
its
crystal
*NL*
blueness
.
The
wind
swept
in
soft
big
breaths
down
from
the
moor
and
*NL*
was
strange
with
a
wild
clear
scented
sweetness
.
Colin
kept
lifting
*NL*
his
thin
chest
to
draw
it
in
,
and
his
big
eyes
looked
as
if
it
were
*NL*
they
which
were
listening
--
listening
,
instead
of
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
so
many
sounds
of
singing
and
humming
and
calling
out
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
What
is
that
scent
the
puffs
of
wind
bring
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
gorse
on
th
'
moor
that
's
openin
'
out
,
''
answered
Dickon
.
``
Eh
!
th
'
*NL*
bees
are
at
it
wonderful
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
human
creature
was
to
be
caught
sight
of
in
the
paths
they
took
.
*NL*
In
fact
every
gardener
or
gardener
's
lad
had
been
witched
away
.
But
*NL*
they
wound
in
and
out
among
the
shrubbery
and
out
and
round
the
*NL*
fountain
beds
,
following
their
carefully
planned
route
for
the
mere
*NL*
mysterious
pleasure
of
it
.
But
when
at
last
they
turned
into
the
Long
*NL*
Walk
by
the
ivied
walls
the
excited
sense
of
an
approaching
thrill
made
*NL*
them
,
for
some
curious
reason
they
could
not
have
explained
,
begin
to
*NL*
speak
in
whispers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
it
,
''
breathed
Mary
.
``
This
is
where
I
used
to
walk
up
and
down
*NL*
and
wonder
and
wonder
.
''
``
Is
it
?
''
cried
Colin
,
and
his
eyes
began
to
*NL*
search
the
ivy
with
eager
curiousness
.
``
But
I
can
see
nothing
,
''
he
*NL*
whispered
.
``
There
is
no
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
thought
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
a
lovely
breathless
silence
and
the
chair
wheeled
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
garden
where
Ben
Weatherstaff
works
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
?
''
said
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
yards
more
and
Mary
whispered
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
where
the
robin
flew
over
the
wall
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
?
''
cried
Colin
.
``
Oh
!
I
wish
he
'd
come
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
,
''
said
Mary
with
solemn
delight
,
pointing
under
a
big
lilac
*NL*
bush
,
``
is
where
he
perched
on
the
little
heap
of
earth
and
showed
me
*NL*
the
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Colin
sat
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
Where
?
There
?
''
he
cried
,
and
his
eyes
were
as
big
as
the
wolf
's
*NL*
in
Red
Riding-Hood
,
when
Red
Riding-Hood
felt
called
upon
to
remark
on
*NL*
them
.
Dickon
stood
still
and
the
wheeled
chair
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
,
''
said
Mary
,
stepping
on
to
the
bed
close
to
the
ivy
,
``
is
*NL*
where
I
went
to
talk
to
him
when
he
chirped
at
me
from
the
top
of
the
*NL*
wall
.
And
this
is
the
ivy
the
wind
blew
back
,
''
and
she
took
hold
of
*NL*
the
hanging
green
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
is
it
--
is
it
!
''
gasped
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
is
the
handle
,
and
here
is
the
door
.
Dickon
push
him
*NL*
in
--
push
him
in
quickly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Dickon
did
it
with
one
strong
,
steady
,
splendid
push
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Colin
had
actually
dropped
back
against
his
cushions
,
even
though
*NL*
he
gasped
with
delight
,
and
he
had
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
*NL*
held
them
there
shutting
out
everything
until
they
were
inside
and
the
*NL*
chair
stopped
as
if
by
magic
and
the
door
was
closed
.
Not
till
then
*NL*
did
he
take
them
away
and
look
round
and
round
and
round
as
Dickon
and
*NL*
Mary
had
done
.
And
over
walls
and
earth
and
trees
and
swinging
sprays
*NL*
and
tendrils
the
fair
green
veil
of
tender
little
leaves
had
crept
,
and
*NL*
in
the
grass
under
the
trees
and
the
gray
urns
in
the
alcoves
and
here
*NL*
and
there
everywhere
were
touches
or
splashes
of
gold
and
purple
and
*NL*
white
and
the
trees
were
showing
pink
and
snow
above
his
head
and
there
*NL*
were
fluttering
of
wings
and
faint
sweet
pipes
and
humming
and
scents
*NL*
and
scents
.
And
the
sun
fell
warm
upon
his
face
like
a
hand
with
a
*NL*
lovely
touch
.
And
in
wonder
Mary
and
Dickon
stood
and
stared
at
him
.
*NL*
He
looked
so
strange
and
different
because
a
pink
glow
of
color
had
*NL*
actually
crept
all
over
him
--
ivory
face
and
neck
and
hands
and
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
get
well
!
I
shall
get
well
!
''
he
cried
out
.
``
Mary
!
Dickon
!
I
*NL*
shall
get
well
!
And
I
shall
live
forever
and
ever
and

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
BEN
WEATHERSTAFF
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
strange
things
about
living
in
the
world
is
that
it
is
only
*NL*
now
and
then
one
is
quite
sure
one
is
going
to
live
forever
and
ever
*NL*
and
ever
.
One
knows
it
sometimes
when
one
gets
up
at
the
tender
solemn
*NL*
dawn-time
and
goes
out
and
stands
alone
and
throws
one
's
head
far
back
*NL*
and
looks
up
and
up
and
watches
the
pale
sky
slowly
changing
and
*NL*
flushing
and
marvelous
unknown
things
happening
until
the
East
almost
*NL*
makes
one
cry
out
and
one
's
heart
stands
still
at
the
strange
*NL*
unchanging
majesty
of
the
rising
of
the
sun
--
which
has
been
happening
*NL*
every
morning
for
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
.
One
*NL*
knows
it
then
for
a
moment
or
so
.
And
one
knows
it
sometimes
when
one
*NL*
stands
by
oneself
in
a
wood
at
sunset
and
the
mysterious
deep
gold
*NL*
stillness
slanting
through
and
under
the
branches
seems
to
be
saying
*NL*
slowly
again
and
again
something
one
can
not
quite
hear
,
however
much
*NL*
one
tries
.
Then
sometimes
the
immense
quiet
of
the
dark
blue
at
night
*NL*
with
millions
of
stars
waiting
and
watching
makes
one
sure
;
and
*NL*
sometimes
a
sound
of
far-off
music
makes
it
true
;
and
sometimes
a
look
*NL*
in
some
one
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
like
that
with
Colin
when
he
first
saw
and
heard
and
felt
*NL*
the
Springtime
inside
the
four
high
walls
of
a
hidden
garden
.
That
*NL*
afternoon
the
whole
world
seemed
to
devote
itself
to
being
perfect
and
*NL*
radiantly
beautiful
and
kind
to
one
boy
.
Perhaps
out
of
pure
heavenly
*NL*
goodness
the
spring
came
and
crowned
everything
it
possibly
could
into
*NL*
that
one
place
.
More
than
once
Dickon
paused
in
what
he
was
doing
and
*NL*
stood
still
with
a
sort
of
growing
wonder
in
his
eyes
,
shaking
his
head
*NL*
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
it
is
graidely
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'm
twelve
goin
'
on
thirteen
an
'
*NL*
there
's
a
lot
o
'
afternoons
in
thirteen
years
,
but
seems
to
me
like
I
*NL*
never
seed
one
as
graidely
as
this
`
ere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
it
is
a
graidely
one
,
''
said
Mary
,
and
she
sighed
for
mere
joy
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
warrant
it
's
the
graidelest
one
as
ever
was
in
this
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
tha
'
think
,
''
said
Colin
with
dreamy
carefulness
,
``
as
happen
it
*NL*
was
made
loike
this
`
ere
all
o
'
purpose
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
!
''
cried
Mary
admiringly
,
``
that
there
is
a
bit
o
'
good
*NL*
Yorkshire
.
Tha
`
rt
shapin
'
first-rate
--
that
tha
'
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
delight
reigned
.
They
drew
the
chair
under
the
plum-tree
,
which
*NL*
was
snow-white
with
blossoms
and
musical
with
bees
.
It
was
like
a
*NL*
king
's
canopy
,
a
fairy
king
's
.
There
were
flowering
cherry-trees
near
*NL*
and
apple-trees
whose
buds
were
pink
and
white
,
and
here
and
there
one
*NL*
had
burst
open
wide
.
Between
the
blossoming
branches
of
the
canopy
*NL*
bits
of
blue
sky
looked
down
like
wonderful
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
and
Dickon
worked
a
little
here
and
there
and
Colin
watched
them
.
*NL*
They
brought
him
things
to
look
at
--
buds
which
were
opening
,
buds
which
*NL*
were
tight
closed
,
bits
of
twig
whose
leaves
were
just
showing
green
,
*NL*
the
feather
of
a
woodpecker
which
had
dropped
on
the
grass
,
the
empty
*NL*
shell
of
some
bird
early
hatched
.
Dickon
pushed
the
chair
slowly
round
*NL*
and
round
the
garden
,
stopping
every
other
moment
to
let
him
look
at
*NL*
wonders
springing
out
of
the
earth
or
trailing
down
from
trees
.
It
was
*NL*
like
being
taken
in
state
round
the
country
of
a
magic
king
and
queen
*NL*
and
shown
all
the
mysterious
riches
it
contained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
we
shall
see
the
robin
?
''
said
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'll
see
him
often
enow
after
a
bit
,
''
answered
Dickon
.
``
When
th
'
*NL*
eggs
hatches
out
th
'
little
chap
he
'll
be
kep
'
so
busy
it
'll
make
his

head
swim

Tha

backward

for

as
big

on
in

nest
when
he

gets
there

so
as

scarce

An

on

feels
like

*NL*
She
says

it
seemed
like

sweat
must
*NL*
be
droppin
'
off
'em
,
though
folk
ca
n't
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
made
them
giggle
so
delightedly
that
they
were
obliged
to
cover
*NL*
their
mouths
with
their
hands
,
remembering
that
they
must
not
be
heard
.
*NL*
Colin
had
been
instructed
as
to
the
law
of
whispers
and
low
voices
*NL*
several
days
before
.
He
liked
the
mysteriousness
of
it
and
did
his
*NL*
best
,
but
in
the
midst
of
excited
enjoyment
it
is
rather
difficult
*NL*
never
to
laugh
above
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
moment
of
the
afternoon
was
full
of
new
things
and
every
hour
the
*NL*
sunshine
grew
more
golden
.
The
wheeled
chair
had
been
drawn
back
under
*NL*
the
canopy
and
Dickon
had
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
had
just
drawn
out
*NL*
his
pipe
when
Colin
saw
something
he
had
not
had
time
to
notice
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
very
old
tree
over
there
,
is
n't
it
?
''
he
said
.
Dickon
looked
*NL*
across
the
grass
at
the
tree
and
Mary
looked
and
there
was
a
brief
*NL*
moment
of
stillness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Dickon
,
after
it
,
and
his
low
voice
had
a
very
gentle
*NL*
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
gazed
at
the
tree
and
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
branches
are
quite
gray
and
there
's
not
a
single
leaf
anywhere
,
''
*NL*
Colin
went
on
.
``
It
's
quite
dead
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
''
admitted
Dickon
.
``
But
them
roses
as
has
climbed
all
over
it
*NL*
will
near
hide
every
bit
o
'
th
'
dead
wood
when
they
're
full
o
'
leaves
*NL*
an
'
flowers
.
It
wo
n't
look
dead
then
.
It
'll
be
th
'
prettiest
of
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
still
gazed
at
the
tree
and
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
as
if
a
big
branch
had
been
broken
off
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
I
*NL*
wonder
how
it
was
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
been
done
many
a
year
,
''
answered
Dickon
.
``
Eh
!
''
with
a
sudden
*NL*
relieved
start
and
laying
his
hand
on
Colin
.
``
Look
at
that
robin
!
*NL*
There
he
is
!
He
's
been
foragin
'
for
his
mate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
was
almost
too
late
but
he
just
caught
sight
of
him
,
the
flash
of
*NL*
red-breasted
bird
with
something
in
his
beak
.
He
darted
through
the
*NL*
greenness
and
into
the
close-grown
corner
and
was
out
of
sight
.
Colin
*NL*
leaned
back
on
his
cushion
again
,
laughing
a
little
.
``
He
's
taking
her
*NL*
tea
to
her
.
Perhaps
it
's
five
o'clock
.
I
think
I
'd
like
some
tea
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
they
were
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Magic
which
sent
the
robin
,
''
said
Mary
secretly
to
Dickon
*NL*
afterward
.
``
I
know
it
was
Magic
.
''
For
both
she
and
Dickon
had
been
*NL*
afraid
Colin
might
ask
something
about
the
tree
whose
branch
had
broken
*NL*
off
ten
years
ago
and
they
had
talked
it
over
together
and
Dickon
had
*NL*
stood
and
rubbed
his
head
in
a
troubled
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
mun
look
as
if
it
was
n't
no
different
from
th
'
other
trees
,
''
he
had
*NL*
said
.
``
We
could
n't
never
tell
him
how
it
broke
,
poor
lad
.
If
he
says
*NL*
anything
about
it
we
mun
--
we
mun
try
to
look
cheerful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
that
we
mun
,
''
had
answered
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
not
felt
as
if
she
looked
cheerful
when
she
gazed
at
the
*NL*
tree
.
She
wondered
and
wondered
in
those
few
moments
if
there
was
any
*NL*
reality
in
that
other
thing
Dickon
had
said
.
He
had
gone
on
rubbing
*NL*
his
rust-red
hair
in
a
puzzled
way
,
but
a
nice
comforted
look
had
begun
*NL*
to
grow
in
his
blue
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Craven
was
a
very
lovely
young
lady
,
''
he
had
gone
on
rather
*NL*
hesitatingly
.
``
An
'
mother
she
thinks
maybe
she
's
about
Misselthwaite
*NL*
many
a
time
lookin
'
after
Mester
Colin
,
same
as
all
mothers
do
when
*NL*
they
're
took
out
o
'
th
'
world
.
They
have
to
come
back
,
tha
'
sees
.
*NL*
Happen
she
's
been
in
the
garden
an
'
happen
it
was
her
set
us
to
work
,
*NL*
an
'
told
us
to
bring
him
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
thought
he
meant
something
about
Magic
.
She
was
a
great
*NL*
believer
in
Magic
.
Secretly
she
quite
believed
that
Dickon
worked
*NL*
Magic
,
of
course
good
Magic
,
on
everything
near
him
and
that
was
why
*NL*
people
liked
him
so
much
and
wild
creatures
knew
he
was
their
friend
.
*NL*
She
wondered
,
indeed
,
if
it
were
not
possible
that
his
gift
had
brought
*NL*
the
robin
just
at
the
right
moment
when
Colin
asked
that
dangerous
*NL*
question
.
She
felt
that
his
Magic
was
working
all
the
afternoon
and
*NL*
making
Colin
look
like
an
entirely
different
boy
.
It
did
not
seem
*NL*
possible
that
he
could
be
the
crazy
creature
who
had
screamed
and
*NL*
beaten
and
bitten
his
pillow
.
Even
his
ivory
whiteness
seemed
to
*NL*
change
.
The
faint
glow
of
color
which
had
shown
on
his
face
and
neck
*NL*
and
hands
when
he
first
got
inside
the
garden
really
never
quite
died
*NL*
away
.
He
looked
as
if
he
were
made
of
flesh
instead
of
ivory
or
wax
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
saw
the
robin
carry
food
to
his
mate
two
or
three
times
,
and
it
*NL*
was
so
suggestive
of
afternoon
tea
that
Colin
felt
they
must
have
some
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
make
one
of
the
men
servants
bring
some
in
a
basket
to
the
*NL*
rhododendron
walk
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
then
you
and
Dickon
can
bring
it
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
agreeable
idea
,
easily
carried
out
,
and
when
the
white
cloth
*NL*
was
spread
upon
the
grass
,
with
hot
tea
and
buttered
toast
and
*NL*
crumpets
,
a
delightfully
hungry
meal
was
eaten
,
and
several
birds
on
*NL*
domestic
errands
paused
to
inquire
what
was
going
on
and
were
led
into
*NL*
investigating
crumbs
with
great
activity
.
Nut
and
Shell
whisked
up
*NL*
trees
with
pieces
of
cake
and
Soot
took
the
entire
half
of
a
buttered
*NL*
crumpet
into
a
corner
and
pecked
at
and
examined
and
turned
it
over
and
*NL*
made
hoarse
remarks
about
it
until
he
decided
to
swallow
it
all
*NL*
joyfully
in
one
gulp
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
was
dragging
towards
its
mellow
hour
.
The
sun
was
*NL*
deepening
the
gold
of
its
lances
,
the
bees
were
going
home
and
the
*NL*
birds
were
flying
past
less
often
.
Dickon
and
Mary
were
sitting
on
the
*NL*
grass
,
the
tea-basket
was
repacked
ready
to
be
taken
back
to
the
house
,
*NL*
and
Colin
was
lying
against
his
cushions
with
his
heavy
locks
pushed
*NL*
back
from
his
forehead
and
his
face
looking
quite
a
natural
color
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
this
afternoon
to
go
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
I
shall
come
back
*NL*
tomorrow
,
and
the
day
after
,
and
the
day
after
,
and
the
day
after
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
get
plenty
of
fresh
air
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
get
nothing
else
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
've
seen
the
spring
now
and
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
see
the
summer
.
I
'm
going
to
see
everything
grow
here
.
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
grow
here
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
tha
'
will
,
''
said
Dickon
.
``
Us
'll
have
thee
walkin
'
about
here
an
'
*NL*
diggin
'
same
as
other
folk
afore
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
flushed
tremendously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walk
!
''
he
said
.
``
Dig
!
Shall
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
's
glance
at
him
was
delicately
cautious
.
Neither
he
nor
Mary
*NL*
had
ever
asked
if
anything
was
the
matter
with
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
sure
tha
'
will
,
''
he
said
stoutly
.
``
Tha
--
tha
's
got
legs
o
'
thine
*NL*
own
,
same
as
other
folks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
rather
frightened
until
she
heard
Colin
's
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
really
ails
them
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
they
are
so
thin
and
weak
.
*NL*
They
shake
so
that
I
'm
afraid
to
try
to
stand
on
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
Mary
and
Dickon
drew
a
relieved
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
tha
'
stops
bein
'
afraid
tha
`
lt
stand
on
'em
,
''
Dickon
said
with
*NL*
renewed
cheer
.
``
An
'
tha
`
lt
stop
bein
'
afraid
in
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
?
''
said
Colin
,
and
he
lay
still
as
if
he
were
wondering
about
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
really
very
quiet
for
a
little
while
.
The
sun
was
dropping
*NL*
lower
.
It
was
that
hour
when
everything
stills
itself
,
and
they
really
*NL*
had
had
a
busy
and
exciting
afternoon
.
Colin
looked
as
if
he
were
*NL*
resting
luxuriously
.
Even
the
creatures
had
ceased
moving
about
and
*NL*
had
drawn
together
and
were
resting
near
them
.
Soot
had
perched
on
a
*NL*
low
branch
and
drawn
up
one
leg
and
dropped
the
gray
film
drowsily
over
*NL*
his
eyes
.
Mary
privately
thought
he
looked
as
if
he
might
snore
in
a
*NL*
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
this
stillness
it
was
rather
startling
when
Colin
half
*NL*
lifted
his
head
and
exclaimed
in
a
loud
suddenly
alarmed
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
man
?
''
Dickon
and
Mary
scrambled
to
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
!
''
they
both
cried
in
low
quick
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
pointed
to
the
high
wall
.
``
Look
!
''
he
whispered
excitedly
.
``
Just
*NL*
look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
and
Dickon
wheeled
about
and
looked
.
There
was
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
*NL*
indignant
face
glaring
at
them
over
the
wall
from
the
top
of
a
ladder
!
*NL*
He
actually
shook
his
fist
at
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
was
n't
a
bachelder
,
an
'
tha
'
was
a
wench
o
'
mine
,
''
he
cried
,
``
I
'd
*NL*
give
thee
a
hidin
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
mounted
another
step
threateningly
as
if
it
were
his
energetic
*NL*
intention
to
jump
down
and
deal
with
her
;
but
as
she
came
toward
him
he
*NL*
evidently
thought
better
of
it
and
stood
on
the
top
step
of
his
ladder
*NL*
shaking
his
fist
down
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
thowt
much
o
'
thee
!
''
he
harangued
.
``
I
couldna
'
abide
thee
th
'
*NL*
first
time
I
set
eyes
on
thee
.
A
scrawny
buttermilk-faced
young
besom

*NL*
allus
askin

pokin

I
*NL*
never

how

got
so
thick
wi
'
me
.
If
it
hadna
'
been
for
th
'
*NL*
robin
--
Drat
him
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ben
Weatherstaff
,
''
called
out
Mary
,
finding
her
breath
.
She
stood
*NL*
below
him
and
called
up
to
him
with
a
sort
of
gasp
.
``
Ben
Weatherstaff
,
*NL*
it
was
the
robin
who
showed
me
the
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
did
seem
as
if
Ben
really
would
scramble
down
on
her
side
of
*NL*
the
wall
,
he
was
so
outraged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
young
bad
`
un
!
''
he
called
down
at
her
.
``
Layin
'
tha
'
badness

a
*NL*
robin
--
not
but
what
he
's
impidint
enow

.
Him
showin
'
thee
*NL*
th
'
way
!
Him
!
Eh
!
tha
'
young
nowt
''
--
she
could
see
his
next
words
burst
*NL*
out
because
he
was
overpowered
by
curiosity
--
``
however
i
'
this
world
did
*NL*
tha
'
get
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
robin
who
showed
me
the
way
,
''
she
protested
obstinately
.
*NL*
``
He
did
n't
know
he
was
doing
it
but
he
did
.
And
I
ca
n't
tell
you
from
*NL*
here
while
you
're
shaking
your
fist
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
shaking
his
fist
very
suddenly
at
that
very
moment
and
his
*NL*
jaw
actually
dropped
as
he
stared
over
her
head
at
something
he
saw
*NL*
coming
over
the
grass
toward
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
first
sound
of
his
torrent
of
words
Colin
had
been
so
surprised
*NL*
that
he
had
only
sat
up
and
listened
as
if
he
were
spellbound
.
But
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
it
he
had
recovered
himself
and
beckoned
imperiously
to
*NL*
Dickon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wheel
me
over
there
!
''
he
commanded
.
``
Wheel
me
quite
close
and
stop
*NL*
right
in
front
of
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
,
if
you
please
,
this
is
what
Ben
Weatherstaff
beheld
and
which
*NL*
made
his
jaw
drop
.
A
wheeled
chair
with
luxurious
cushions
and
robes
*NL*
which
came
toward
him
looking
rather
like
some
sort
of
State
Coach
*NL*
because
a
young
Rajah
leaned
back
in
it
with
royal
command
in
his
great
*NL*
black-rimmed
eyes
and
a
thin
white
hand
extended
haughtily
toward
him
.
*NL*
And
it
stopped
right
under
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
nose
.
It
was
really
no
*NL*
wonder
his
mouth
dropped
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
who
I
am
?
''
demanded
the
Rajah
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
Ben
Weatherstaff
stared
!
His
red
old
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
what
*NL*
was
before
him
as
if
he
were
seeing
a
ghost
.
He
gazed
and
gazed
and
*NL*
gulped
a
lump
down
his
throat
and
did
not
say
a
word
.
``
Do
you
know
who
*NL*
I
am
?
''
demanded
Colin
still
more
imperiously
.
``
Answer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
put
his
gnarled
hand
up
and
passed
it
over
his
eyes
*NL*
and
over
his
forehead
and
then
he
did
answer
in
a
queer
shaky
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
tha
'
art
?
''
he
said
.

*NL*
*NL*
Colin
forgot
that
he
had
ever
had
a
back
.
His
face
flushed
scarlet
and
*NL*
he
sat
bolt
upright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
a
cripple

''
he
cried
out
furiously
.
``
I
'm
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not

''
cried
Mary
,
almost
shouting
up
the
wall
in
her
fierce
*NL*
indignation
.
``
He
's
not
got
a
lump
as
big
as
a

I
looked

there
*NL*
was

not

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
again
and
gazed
as
*NL*
if
he
could
never
gaze
enough
.
His
hand
shook
and
his
mouth
shook
and
*NL*
his
voice
shook
.
He
was
an
ignorant
old
man
and
a
tactless
old
man
and
*NL*
he
could
only
remember
the
things
he
had
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
--
tha
'
has
n't
got
a
crooked
back
?
''
he
said
hoarsely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
shouted
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
--
tha
'
has
n't
got
crooked
legs

''
quavered
Ben
more
hoarsely
yet
.
*NL*
It
was
too
much
.
The
strength
which
Colin
usually
threw
into
his
*NL*
tantrums
rushed
through
him
now
in
a
new
way
.
Never
yet
had
he
been
*NL*
accused
of
crooked
legs
--
even
in
whispers
--
and
the
perfectly
simple
*NL*
belief
in
their
existence
which
was
revealed
by
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
*NL*
voice
was
more
than
Rajah
flesh
and
blood
could
endure
.
His
anger
and
*NL*
insulted
pride
made
him
forget
everything
but
this
one
moment
and
*NL*
filled
him
with
a
power
he
had
never
known
before
,
an
almost
unnatural
*NL*
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
!
''
he
shouted
to
Dickon
,
and
he
actually
began
to
tear
the
*NL*
coverings
off
his
lower
limbs
and
disentangle
himself
.
``
Come
here
!
*NL*
Come
here
!
This
minute
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
was
by
his
side
in
a
second
.
Mary
caught
her
breath
in
a
short
*NL*
gasp
and
felt
herself
turn
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
can
do
it
!
He
can
do
it
!
He
can
do
it
!
He
can
!
''
she
gabbled
over
to
*NL*
herself
under
her
breath
as
fast
as
ever
she
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
brief
fierce
scramble
,
the
rugs
were
tossed
on
the
ground
,
*NL*
Dickon
held
Colin
's
arm
,
the
thin
legs
were
out
,
the
thin
feet
were
on
*NL*
the
grass
.
Colin
was
standing
upright
--
upright
--
as
straight
as
an
*NL*
arrow
and
looking
strangely
tall
--
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
strange
*NL*
eyes
flashing
lightning
.
``
Look
at
me
!
''
he
flung
up
at
Ben
*NL*
Weatherstaff
.
``
Just
look
at
me
--
you
!
Just
look
at
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
as
straight
as
I
am

''
cried
Dickon
.
``
He
's
as
straight
as
any
lad
*NL*
i
'
Yorkshire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
Ben
Weatherstaff
did
Mary
thought
queer
beyond
measure
.
He
choked
*NL*
and
gulped
and
suddenly
tears
ran
down
his
weather-wrinkled
cheeks
as
*NL*
he
struck
his
old
hands
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
he
burst
forth
,
``
th
'
lies
folk
tells

Tha
`
rt

thin

a

Tha
`

*NL*
a
mon

God
bless

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
held
Colin
's
arm
strongly
but
the
boy
had
not
begun
to
falter
.
*NL*
He
stood
straighter
and
straighter
and
looked
Ben
Weatherstaff
in
the
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
your
master
,
''
he
said
,
``
when
my
father
is
away
.
And
you
are
to
*NL*
obey
me
.
This
is
my
garden

Do
n't
dare
to
say
a
word
about

get
down
from

ladder
and
go
out
to

Long
Walk
and
Miss
Mary
*NL*

meet
you
and
bring
you
here

I
want
to
talk
to
you

We
did
not
*NL*
want
you
,
but
now
you
will
have
to
be
in
the
secret
.
Be
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
crabbed
old
face
was
still
wet
with
that
one
queer
*NL*
rush
of
tears
.
It
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
thin
*NL*
straight
Colin
standing
on
his
feet
with
his
head
thrown
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
lad
,
''
he
almost
whispered
.
``
Eh
!
my
lad
!
''
And
then
remembering
*NL*
himself
he
suddenly
touched
his
hat
gardener
fashion
and
said
,
``
Yes
,
*NL*
sir
!
Yes
,
sir
!
''
and
obediently
disappeared
as
he
descended
the
ladder
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
THE
SUN
WENT
DOWN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
his
head
was
out
of
sight
Colin
turned
to
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
meet
him
,
''
he
said
;
and
Mary
flew
across
the
grass
to
the
door
*NL*
under
the
ivy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
was
watching
him
with
sharp
eyes
.
There
were
scarlet
spots
on
*NL*
his
cheeks
and
he
looked
amazing
,
but
he
showed
no
signs
of
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
stand
,
''
he
said
,
and
his
head
was
still
held
up
and
he
said
it
*NL*
quite
grandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
thee
tha
'
could
as
soon
as
tha
'
stopped
bein
'
afraid
,
''
answered
*NL*
Dickon
.
``
An
'
tha
's
stopped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
've
stopped
,
''
said
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
suddenly
he
remembered
something
Mary
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
making
Magic
?
''
he
asked
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
's
curly
mouth
spread
in
a
cheerful
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
's
doin
'
Magic
thysel
'
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
same
Magic
as
made
these
*NL*
`
ere
work
out
o
'
th
'
earth
,
''
and
he
touched
with
his
thick
boot
a
clump
*NL*
of
crocuses
in
the
grass
.
Colin
looked
down
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
''
he
said
slowly
,
``
there
couldna
'
be
bigger
Magic
than
that
*NL*
there
--
there
couldna
'
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
himself
up
straighter
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
walk
to
that
tree
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
one
a
few
feet
*NL*
away
from
him
.
``
I
'm
going
to
be
standing
when
Weatherstaff
comes
here
.
*NL*
I
can
rest
against
the
tree
if
I
like
.
When
I
want
to
sit
down
I
will
*NL*
sit
down
,
but
not
before
.
Bring
a
rug
from
the
chair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
to
the
tree
and
though
Dickon
held
his
arm
he
was
wonderfully
*NL*
steady
.
When
he
stood
against
the
tree
trunk
it
was
not
too
plain
that
*NL*
he
supported
himself
against
it
,
and
he
still
held
himself
so
straight
*NL*
that
he
looked
tall
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Ben
Weatherstaff
came
through
the
door
in
the
wall
he
saw
him
*NL*
standing
there
and
he
heard
Mary
muttering
something
under
her
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
art
sayin
'
?
''
he
asked
rather
testily
because
he
did
not
want
his
*NL*
attention
distracted
from
the
long
thin
straight
boy
figure
and
proud
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
did
not
tell
him
.
What
she
was
saying
was
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
do
it
!
You
can
do
it
!
I
told
you
you
could
!
You
can
do
it
!
*NL*
You
can
do
it
!
You
can
!
''
She
was
saying
it
to
Colin
because
she
wanted
*NL*
to
make
Magic
and
keep
him
on
his
feet
looking
like
that
.
She
could
*NL*
not
bear
that
he
should
give
in
before
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
He
did
not
*NL*
give
in
.
She
was
uplifted
by
a
sudden
feeling
that
he
looked
quite
*NL*
beautiful
in
spite
of
his
thinness
.
He
fixed
his
eyes
on
Ben
*NL*
Weatherstaff
in
his
funny
imperious
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
me
!
''
he
commanded
.
``
Look
at
me
all
over
!
Am
I
a
hunchback
?
*NL*
Have
I
got
crooked
legs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
had
not
quite
got
over
his
emotion
,
but
he
had
*NL*
recovered
a
little
and
answered
almost
in
his
usual
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
tha
'
,
''
he
said
.
``
Nowt
o
'
th
'
sort
.
What
's

been
doin
'
with

thysel

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half-witted
!
''
said
Colin
angrily
.
``
Who
thought
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lots
o
'
fools
,
''
said
Ben
.
``
Th
'

's

o

*NL*

What

'
up
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everyone
thought
I
was
going
to
die
,
''
said
Colin
shortly
.
``
I
'm
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
said
it
with
such
decision
Ben
Weatherstaff
looked
him
over
,
up
*NL*
and
down
,
down
and
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
die
!
''
he
said
with
dry
exultation
.
``
Nowt
o
'
th
'
sort
!
Tha
's
got
*NL*
too
much
pluck
in
thee
.
When
I
seed
thee
put
tha
'
legs
on
th
'
ground
*NL*
in
such
a
hurry
I
knowed

was
all
right

Sit

down
on
th
'
rug
*NL*

bit
young
Mester

give
me
thy
orders

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
queer
mixture
of
crabbed
tenderness
and
shrewd
*NL*
understanding
in
his
manner
.
Mary
had
poured
out
speech
as
rapidly
as
*NL*
she
could
as
they
had
come
down
the
Long
Walk
.
The
chief
thing
to
be
*NL*
remembered
,
she
had
told
him
,
was
that
Colin
was
getting
well
--
getting
*NL*
well
.
The
garden
was
doing
it
.
No
one
must
let
him
remember
about
*NL*
having
humps
and
dying
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rajah
condescended
to
seat
himself
on
a
rug
under
the
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
work
do
you
do
in
the
gardens
,
Weatherstaff
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anythin
'
I
'm
told
to
do
,
''
answered
old
Ben
.
``
I
'm
kep
'
on
by
*NL*
favor
--
because
she
liked
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
?
''
said
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
mother

''
answered
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
?
''
said
Colin
,
and
he
looked
about
him
quietly
.
``
This
was
*NL*
her
garden
,
was
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
it
was
that
!
''
and
Ben
Weatherstaff
looked
about
him
too
.
``
She
*NL*
were
main
fond
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
garden
now

I
am
fond
of
it

I
shall
come
here
every

*NL*
announced
Colin
.
``
But
it
is
to
be

My

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
face
twisted
itself
in
a
dry
old
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

come
here
before

he
said

exclaimed
Colin

*NL*
``
When

*NL*
*NL*
``
Th

his

looking
round

dryly

*NL*
``

fond

Ben

slowly

On

the
tree
Mary
had
dropped
her
trowel
.
Colin
*NL*
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
it
up
.
An
odd
expression
came
into
his
*NL*
face
and
he
began
to
scratch
at
the
earth
.
His
thin
hand
was
weak
*NL*
enough
but
presently
as
they
watched
him
--
Mary
with
quite
breathless
*NL*
interest
--
he
drove
the
end
of
the
trowel
into
the
soil
and
turned
some
*NL*
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
do
it
!
You
can
do
it
!
''
said
Mary
to
herself
.
``
I
tell
you
,
you
*NL*
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
's
round
eyes
were
full
of
eager
curiousness
but
he
said
not
a
*NL*
word
.
Ben
Weatherstaff
looked
on
with
interested
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
persevered
.
After
he
had
turned
a
few
trowelfuls
of
soil
he
*NL*
spoke
exultantly
to
Dickon
in
his
best
Yorkshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
said
as
tha
'd
have
me
walkin
'
about
here
same
as
other
folk
--
an

*NL*

have
me
diggin

.
I
thowt
tha

was
just
leein

to
please
*NL*
me
.
This
is
only
th
'
first
day
an
'
I
've
walked
--
an
'
here
I
am
diggin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
mouth
fell
open
again
when
he
heard
him
,
but
he
*NL*
ended
by
chuckling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
he
said
,
``
that
sounds
as
if
tha
'd
got
wits
enow
.
Tha
`
rt
a
*NL*
Yorkshire
lad
for
sure
.
An
'
tha
`
rt
diggin
'
,
too
.
How
'd
tha
'
like
to
*NL*
plant
a
bit
o
'
somethin'
?
I
can
get
thee
a
rose
in
a
pot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
get
it
!
''
said
Colin
,
digging
excitedly
.
``
Quick
!
Quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
done
quickly
enough
indeed
.
Ben
Weatherstaff
went
his
way
*NL*
forgetting
rheumatics
.
Dickon
took
his
spade
and
dug
the
hole
deeper
*NL*
and
wider
than
a
new
digger
with
thin
white
hands
could
make
it
.
Mary
*NL*
slipped
out
to
run
and
bring
back
a
watering-can
.
When
Dickon
had
*NL*
deepened
the
hole
Colin
went
on
turning
the
soft
earth
over
and
over
.
*NL*
He
looked
up
at
the
sky
,
flushed
and
glowing
with
the
strangely
new
*NL*
exercise
,
slight
as
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
do
it
before
the
sun
goes
quite
--
quite
down
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
thought
that
perhaps
the
sun
held
back
a
few
minutes
just
on
*NL*
purpose
.
Ben
Weatherstaff
brought
the
rose
in
its
pot
from
the
*NL*
greenhouse
.
He
hobbled
over
the
grass
as
fast
as
he
could
.
He
had
*NL*
begun
to
be
excited
,
too
.
He
knelt
down
by
the
hole
and
broke
the
pot
*NL*
from
the
mould
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
lad
,
''
he
said
,
handing
the
plant
to
Colin
.
``
Set
it
in
the
earth
*NL*
thysel
'
same
as
th
'
king
does
when
he
goes
to
a
new
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thin
white
hands
shook
a
little
and
Colin
's
flush
grew
deeper
as
he
*NL*
set
the
rose
in
the
mould
and
held
it
while
old
Ben
made
firm
the
*NL*
earth
.
It
was
filled
in
and
pressed
down
and
made
steady
.
Mary
was
*NL*
leaning
forward
on
her
hands
and
knees
.
Soot
had
flown
down
and
*NL*
marched
forward
to
see
what
was
being
done
.
Nut
and
Shell
chattered
*NL*
about
it
from
a
cherry-tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
planted
!
''
said
Colin
at
last
.
``
And
the
sun
is
only
slipping
over
*NL*
the
edge
.
Help
me
up
,
Dickon
.
I
want
to
be
standing
when
it
goes
.
*NL*
That
's
part
of
the
Magic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Dickon
helped
him
,
and
the
Magic
--
or
whatever
it
was
--
so
gave
him
*NL*
strength
that
when
the
sun
did
slip
over
the
edge
and
end
the
strange
*NL*
lovely
afternoon
for
them
there
he
actually
stood
on
his
two
*NL*
feet
--
laughing
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
MAGIC
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Craven
had
been
waiting
some
time
at
the
house
when
they
returned
*NL*
to
it
.
He
had
indeed
begun
to
wonder
if
it
might
not
be
wise
to
send
*NL*
some
one
out
to
explore
the
garden
paths
.
When
Colin
was
brought
back
*NL*
to
his
room
the
poor
man
looked
him
over
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
not
have
stayed
so
long
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
must
not
overexert
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
tired
at
all
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
It
has
made
me
well
.
Tomorrow
I
*NL*
am
going
out
in
the
morning
as
well
as
in
the
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sure
that
I
can
allow
it
,
''
answered
Dr.
Craven
.
``
I
am
afraid
*NL*
it
would
not
be
wise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
not
be
wise
to
try
to
stop
me
,
''
said
Colin
quite
seriously
.
*NL*
``
I
am
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Mary
had
found
out
that
one
of
Colin
's
chief
peculiarities
was
*NL*
that
he
did
not
know
in
the
least
what
a
rude
little
brute
he
was
with
*NL*
his
way
of
ordering
people
about
.
He
had
lived
on
a
sort
of
desert
*NL*
island
all
his
life
and
as
he
had
been
the
king
of
it
he
had
made
his
*NL*
own
manners
and
had
had
no
one
to
compare
himself
with
.
Mary
had
*NL*
indeed
been
rather
like
him
herself
and
since
she
had
been
at
*NL*
Misselthwaite
had
gradually
discovered
that
her
own
manners
had
not
*NL*
been
of
the
kind
which
is
usual
or
popular
.
Having
made
this
discovery
*NL*
she
naturally
thought
it
of
enough
interest
to
communicate
to
Colin
.
*NL*
So
she
sat
and
looked
at
him
curiously
for
a
few
minutes
after
Dr.
*NL*
Craven
had
gone
.
She
wanted
to
make
him
ask
her
why
she
was
doing
it
*NL*
and
of
course
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
looking
at
me
for
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
thinking
that
I
am
rather
sorry
for
Dr.
Craven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I
,
''
said
Colin
calmly
,
but
not
without
an
air
of
some
*NL*
satisfaction
.
``
He
wo
n't
get
Misselthwaite
at
all
now
I
'm
not
going
to
*NL*
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
for
him
because
of
that
,
of
course
,
''
said
Mary
,
``
but
I
was
*NL*
thinking
just
then
that
it
must
have
been
very
horrid
to
have
had
to
be
*NL*
polite
for
ten
years
to
a
boy
who
was
always
rude
.
I
would
never
have
*NL*
done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
rude
?
''
Colin
inquired
undisturbedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
been
his
own
boy
and
he
had
been
a
slapping
sort
of
man
,
''
*NL*
said
Mary
,
``
he
would
have
slapped
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
dare
n't
,
''
said
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
dare
n't
,
''
answered
Mistress
Mary
,
thinking
the
thing
out
quite
*NL*
without
prejudice
.
``
Nobody
ever
dared
to
do
anything
you
did
n't
*NL*
like
--
because
you
were
going
to
die
and
things
like
that
.
You
were
*NL*
such
a
poor
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
announced
Colin
stubbornly
,
``
I
am
not
going
to
be
a
poor
thing
.
*NL*
I
wo
n't
let
people
think
I
'm
one
.
I
stood
on
my
feet
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
always
having
your
own
way
that
has
made
you
so
queer
,
''
Mary
*NL*
went
on
,
thinking
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
turned
his
head
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
queer
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Mary
,
``
very
.
But
you
need
n't
be
cross
,
''
she
added
*NL*
impartially
,
``
because
so
am
I
queer
--
and
so
is
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
But
I
*NL*
am
not
as
queer
as
I
was
before
I
began
to
like
people
and
before
I
*NL*
found
the
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
be
queer
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
I
am
not
going
to
be
,
''
and
he
*NL*
frowned
again
with
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
very
proud
boy
.
He
lay
thinking
for
a
while
and
then
Mary
saw
*NL*
his
beautiful
smile
begin
and
gradually
change
his
whole
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
stop
being
queer
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
I
go
every
day
to
the
garden
.
*NL*
There
is
Magic
in
there
--
good
Magic
,
you
know
,
Mary
.
I
am
sure
there
*NL*
is
.
''
``
So
am
I
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
if
it
is
n't
real
Magic
,
''
Colin
said
,
``
we
can
pretend
it
is
.
*NL*
Something
is
there
--
something
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Magic
,
''
said
Mary
,
``
but
not
black
.
It
's
as
white
as
snow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
always
called
it
Magic
and
indeed
it
seemed
like
it
in
the
months
*NL*
that
followed
--
the
wonderful
months
--
the
radiant
months
--
the
amazing
*NL*
ones
.
Oh
!
the
things
which
happened
in
that
garden
!
If
you
have
never
*NL*
had
a
garden
you
can
not
understand
,
and
if
you
have
had
a
garden
you
*NL*
will
know
that
it
would
take
a
whole
book
to
describe
all
that
came
to
*NL*
pass
there
.
At
first
it
seemed
that
green
things
would
never
cease
*NL*
pushing
their
way
through
the
earth
,
in
the
grass
,
in
the
beds
,
even
in
*NL*
the
crevices
of
the
walls
.
Then
the
green
things
began
to
show
buds
*NL*
and
the
buds
began
to
unfurl
and
show
color
,
every
shade
of
blue
,
every
*NL*
shade
of
purple
,
every
tint
and
hue
of
crimson
.
In
its
happy
days
*NL*
flowers
had
been
tucked
away
into
every
inch
and
hole
and
corner
.
Ben
*NL*
Weatherstaff
had
seen
it
done
and
had
himself
scraped
out
mortar
from
*NL*
between
the
bricks
of
the
wall
and
made
pockets
of
earth
for
lovely
*NL*
clinging
things
to
grow
on
.
Iris
and
white
lilies
rose
out
of
the
*NL*
grass
in
sheaves
,
and
the
green
alcoves
filled
themselves
with
amazing
*NL*
armies
of
the
blue
and
white
flower
lances
of
tall
delphiniums
or
*NL*
columbines
or
campanulas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
main
fond
o
'
them
--
she
was
,
''
Ben
Weatherstaff
said
.
``
She
*NL*
liked
them
things
as
was
allus
pointin
'
up
to
th
'
blue
sky
,
she
used
to
*NL*
tell
.
Not
as
she
was
one
o
'
them
as
looked
down
on
th
'
earth
--
not
her
.
*NL*
She
just
loved
it
but
she
said
as
th
'
blue
sky
allus
looked
so
joyful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
seeds
Dickon
and
Mary
had
planted
grew
as
if
fairies
had
tended
*NL*
them
.
Satiny
poppies
of
all
tints
danced
in
the
breeze
by
the
score
,
*NL*
gaily
defying
flowers
which
had
lived
in
the
garden
for
years
and
which
*NL*
it
might
be
confessed
seemed
rather
to
wonder
how
such
new
people
had
*NL*
got
there
.
And
the
roses
--
the
roses
!
Rising
out
of
the
grass
,
tangled
*NL*
round
the
sun-dial
,
wreathing
the
tree
trunks
and
hanging
from
their
*NL*
branches
,
climbing
up
the
walls
and
spreading
over
them
with
long
*NL*
garlands
falling
in
cascades
--
they
came
alive
day
by
day
,
hour
by
hour
.
*NL*
Fair
fresh
leaves
,
and
buds
--
and
buds
--
tiny
at
first
but
swelling
and
*NL*
working
Magic
until
they
burst
and
uncurled
into
cups
of
scent
*NL*
delicately
spilling
themselves
over
their
brims
and
filling
the
garden
*NL*
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
saw
it
all
,
watching
each
change
as
it
took
place
.
Every
morning
*NL*
he
was
brought
out
and
every
hour
of
each
day
when
it
did
n't
rain
he
*NL*
spent
in
the
garden
.
Even
gray
days
pleased
him
.
He
would
lie
on
the
*NL*
grass
``
watching
things
growing
,
''
he
said
.
If
you
watched
long
enough
,
*NL*
he
declared
,
you
could
see
buds
unsheath
themselves
.
Also
you
could
*NL*
make
the
acquaintance
of
strange
busy
insect
things
running
about
on
*NL*
various
unknown
but
evidently
serious
errands
,
sometimes
carrying
tiny
*NL*
scraps
of
straw
or
feather
or
food
,
or
climbing
blades
of
grass
as
if
*NL*
they
were
trees
from
whose
tops
one
could
look
out
to
explore
the
*NL*
country
.
A
mole
throwing
up
its
mound
at
the
end
of
its
burrow
and
*NL*
making
its
way
out
at
last
with
the
long-nailed
paws
which
looked
so
*NL*
like
elfish
hands
,
had
absorbed
him
one
whole
morning
.
Ants
'
ways
,
*NL*
beetles
'
ways
,
bees
'
ways
,
frogs
'
ways
,
birds
'
ways
,
plants
'
ways
,
gave
*NL*
him
a
new
world
to
explore
and
when
Dickon
revealed
them
all
and
added
*NL*
foxes
'
ways
,
otters
'
ways
,
ferrets
'
ways
,
squirrels
'
ways
,
and
trout
'
*NL*
and
water-rats
'
and
badgers
'
ways
,
there
was
no
end
to
the
things
to
*NL*
talk
about
and
think
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
was
not
the
half
of
the
Magic
.
The
fact
that
he
had
really
*NL*
once
stood
on
his
feet
had
set
Colin
thinking
tremendously
and
when
*NL*
Mary
told
him
of
the
spell
she
had
worked
he
was
excited
and
approved
*NL*
of
it
greatly
.
He
talked
of
it
constantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
there
must
be
lots
of
Magic
in
the
world
,
''
he
said
wisely
*NL*
one
day
,
``
but
people
do
n't
know
what
it
is
like
or
how
to
make
it
.
*NL*
Perhaps
the
beginning
is
just
to
say
nice
things
are
going
to
happen
*NL*
until
you
make
them
happen
.
I
am
going
to

The
next
morning
when
they
went
to
the
secret
garden
he
sent
at
once
*NL*
for
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
Ben
came
as
quickly
as
he
could
and
found
the
*NL*
Rajah
standing
on
his
feet
under
a
tree
and
looking
very
grand
but
also
*NL*
very
beautifully
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
Ben
Weatherstaff
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
want
you
and
Dickon
and
*NL*
Miss
Mary
to
stand
in
a
row
and
listen
to
me
because
I
am
going
to
tell
*NL*
you
something
very
important
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
sir
!
''
answered
Ben
Weatherstaff
,
touching
his
forehead
.
*NL*
-LRB-
One
of
the
long
concealed
charms
of
Ben
Weatherstaff
was
that
in
his
*NL*
boyhood
he
had
once
run
away
to
sea
and
had
made
voyages
.
So
he
could
*NL*
reply
like
a
sailor
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
try
a
scientific
experiment
,
''
explained
the
Rajah
.
*NL*
``
When
I
grow
up
I
am
going
to
make
great
scientific
discoveries
and
I
*NL*
am
going
to
begin
now
with
this
experiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
sir
!
''
said
Ben
Weatherstaff
promptly
,
though
this
was
the
*NL*
first
time
he
had
heard
of
great
scientific
discoveries
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
Mary
had
heard
of
them
,
either
,
but
even
at
this
*NL*
stage
she
had
begun
to
realize
that
,
queer
as
he
was
,
Colin
had
read
*NL*
about
a
great
many
singular
things
and
was
somehow
a
very
convincing
*NL*
sort
of
boy
.
When
he
held
up
his
head
and
fixed
his
strange
eyes
on
*NL*
you
it
seemed
as
if
you
believed
him
almost
in
spite
of
yourself
though
*NL*
he
was
only
ten
years
old
--
going
on
eleven
.
At
this
moment
he
was
*NL*
especially
convincing
because
he
suddenly
felt
the
fascination
of
*NL*
actually
making
a
sort
of
speech
like
a
grown-up
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
great
scientific
discoveries
I
am
going
to
make
,
''
he
went
on
,
*NL*
``
will
be
about
Magic
.
Magic
is
a
great
thing
and
scarcely
any
one
*NL*
knows
anything
about
it
except
a
few
people
in
old
books
--
and
Mary
a
*NL*
little
,
because
she
was
born
in
India
where
there
are
fakirs
.
I
*NL*
believe
Dickon
knows
some
Magic
,
but
perhaps
he
does
n't
know
he
knows
*NL*
it
.
He
charms
animals
and
people
.
I
would
never
have
let
him
come
to
*NL*
see
me
if
he
had
not
been
an
animal
charmer
--
which
is
a
boy
charmer
,
*NL*
too
,
because
a
boy
is
an
animal
.
I
am
sure
there
is
Magic
in
*NL*
everything
,
only
we
have
not
sense
enough
to
get
hold
of
it
and
make
it
*NL*
do
things
for
us
--
like
electricity
and
horses
and
steam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
sounded
so
imposing
that
Ben
Weatherstaff
became
quite
excited
and
*NL*
really
could
not
keep
still
.
``
Aye
,
aye
,
sir
,
''
he
said
and
he
began
to
*NL*
stand
up
quite
straight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Mary
found
this
garden
it
looked
quite
dead
,
''
the
orator
*NL*
proceeded
.
``
Then
something
began
pushing
things
up
out
of
the
soil
and
*NL*
making
things
out
of
nothing
.
One
day
things
were
n't
there
and
another
*NL*
they
were
.
I
had
never
watched
things
before
and
it
made
me
feel
very
*NL*
curious
.
Scientific
people
are
always
curious
and
I
am
going
to
be
*NL*
scientific
.
I
keep
saying
to
myself
,
`
What
is
it
?
What
is
it
?
'
It
's
*NL*
something
.
It
ca
n't
be
nothing
!
I
do
n't
know
its
name
so
I
call
it
*NL*
Magic
.
I
have
never
seen
the
sun
rise
but
Mary
and
Dickon
have
and
*NL*
from
what
they
tell
me
I
am
sure
that
is
Magic
too
.
Something
pushes
*NL*
it
up
and
draws
it
.
Sometimes
since
I
've
been
in
the
garden
I
've
*NL*
looked
up
through
the
trees
at
the
sky
and
I
have
had
a
strange
feeling
*NL*
of
being
happy
as
if
something
were
pushing
and
drawing
in
my
chest
and
*NL*
making
me
breathe
fast
.
Magic
is
always
pushing
and
drawing
and
making
*NL*
things
out
of
nothing
.
Everything
is
made
out
of
Magic
,
leaves
and
*NL*
trees
,
flowers
and
birds
,
badgers
and
foxes
and
squirrels
and
people
.
*NL*
So
it
must
be
all
around
us
.
In
this
garden
--
in
all
the
places
.
The
*NL*
Magic
in
this
garden
has
made
me
stand
up
and
know
I
am
going
to
live
*NL*
to
be
a
man
.
I
am
going
to
make
the
scientific
experiment
of
trying
to
*NL*
get
some
and
put
it
in
myself
and
make
it
push
and
draw
me
and
make
me
*NL*
strong
.
I
do
n't
know
how
to
do
it
but
I
think
that
if
you
keep
*NL*
thinking
about
it
and
calling
it
perhaps
it
will
come
.
Perhaps
that
is
*NL*
the
first
baby
way
to
get
it
.
When
I
was
going
to
try
to
stand
that
*NL*
first
time
Mary
kept
saying
to
herself
as
fast
as
she
could
,
`
You
can
*NL*
do
it
!
You
can
do
it
!
'
and
I
did
.
I
had
to
try
myself
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
of
course
,
but
her
Magic
helped
me
--
and
so
did
Dickon
's
.
Every
*NL*
morning
and
evening
and
as
often
in
the
daytime
as
I
can
remember
I
am
*NL*
going
to
say
,
`
Magic
is
in
me
!
Magic
is
making
me
well
!
I
am
going
to
*NL*
be
as
strong
as
Dickon
,
as
strong
as
Dickon
!
'
And
you
must
all
do
it
,
*NL*
too
.
That
is
my
experiment
Will
you
help
,
Ben
Weatherstaff
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
sir
!
''
said
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
``
Aye
,
aye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
keep
doing
it
every
day
as
regularly
as
soldiers
go
through
*NL*
drill
we
shall
see
what
will
happen
and
find
out
if
the
experiment
*NL*
succeeds
.
You
learn
things
by
saying
them
over
and
over
and
thinking
*NL*
about
them
until
they
stay
in
your
mind
forever
and
I
think
it
will
be
*NL*
the
same
with
Magic
.
If
you
keep
calling
it
to
come
to
you
and
help
*NL*
you
it
will
get
to
be
part
of
you
and
it
will
stay
and
do
things
.
''
``
I
*NL*
once
heard
an
officer
in
India
tell
my
mother
that
there
were
fakirs
*NL*
who
said
words
over
and
over
thousands
of
times
,
''
said
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
Jem
Fettleworth
's
wife
say
th
'
same
thing
over
thousands
o
'
*NL*
times
--
callin
'
Jem
a
drunken
brute
,
''
said
Ben
Weatherstaff
dryly
.
*NL*
``
Summat
allus
come
o
'
that
,
sure
enough
.
He
gave
her
a
good
hidin
'
an
'
*NL*
went
to
th
'
Blue
Lion
an
'
got
as
drunk
as

lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
drew
his
brows
together
and
thought
a
few
minutes
.
Then
he
*NL*
cheered
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
see
something
did
come
of
it
.
She
used
the
wrong
*NL*
Magic
until
she
made
him
beat
her
.
If
she
'd
used
the
right
Magic
and
*NL*
had
said
something
nice
perhaps
he
would
n't
have
got
as
drunk
as
a
lord
*NL*
and
perhaps
--
perhaps
he
might
have
bought
her
a
new
bonnet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
chuckled
and
there
was
shrewd
admiration
in
his
little
*NL*
old
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
`
rt
a
clever
lad
as
well
as
a
straight-legged
one
,
Mester
Colin
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
Next
time
I
see
Bess
Fettleworth
I
'll
give
her
a
bit
of
a
*NL*
hint
o
'
what
Magic
will
do
for
her
.
She
'd
be
rare
an
'
pleased
if
th
'
*NL*
sinetifik
`
speriment
worked
--
an
'
so
`
ud
Jem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
had
stood
listening
to
the
lecture
,
his
round
eyes
shining
with
*NL*
curious
delight
.
Nut
and
Shell
were
on
his
shoulders
and
he
held
a
*NL*
long-eared
white
rabbit
in
his
arm
and
stroked
and
stroked
it
softly
*NL*
while
it
laid
its
ears
along
its
back
and
enjoyed
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
the
experiment
will
work
?
''
Colin
asked
him
,
wondering
*NL*
what
he
was
thinking
.
He
so
often
wondered
what
Dickon
was
thinking
*NL*
when
he
saw
him
looking
at
him
or
at
one
of
his
``
creatures
''
with
his
*NL*
happy
wide
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
now
and
his
smile
was
wider
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
''
he
answered
,
``
that
I
do
.
It
'll
work
same
as
th
'
seeds
do
when
*NL*
th
'
sun
shines
on
'em
.
It
'll
work
for
sure
.
Shall
us
begin
it
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
was
delighted
and
so
was
Mary
.
Fired
by
recollections
of
fakirs
*NL*
and
devotees
in
illustrations
Colin
suggested
that
they
should
all
sit
*NL*
cross-legged
under
the
tree
which
made
a
canopy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
like
sitting
in
a
sort
of
temple
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
I
'm
rather
*NL*
tired
and
I
want
to
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
said
Dickon
,
``
tha
'
must
n't
begin
by
sayin
'
tha
`
rt
tired
.
Tha
'
*NL*
might
spoil
th
'
Magic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
turned
and
looked
at
him
--
into
his
innocent
round
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
he
said
slowly
.
``
I
must
only
think
of
the
Magic
.
''
It
*NL*
all
seemed
most
majestic
and
mysterious
when
they
sat
down
in
their
*NL*
circle
.
Ben
Weatherstaff
felt
as
if
he
had
somehow
been
led
into
*NL*
appearing
at
a
prayer-meeting
.
Ordinarily
he
was
very
fixed
in
being
*NL*
what
he
called
``
agen
'
prayer-meetin
's
''
but
this
being
the
Rajah
's
*NL*
affair
he
did
not
resent
it
and
was
indeed
inclined
to
be
gratified
at
*NL*
being
called
upon
to
assist
.
Mistress
Mary
felt
solemnly
enraptured
.
*NL*
Dickon
held
his
rabbit
in
his
arm
,
and
perhaps
he
made
some
charmer
's
*NL*
signal
no
one
heard
,
for
when
he
sat
down
,
cross-legged
like
the
rest
,
*NL*
the
crow
,
the
fox
,
the
squirrels
and
the
lamb
slowly
drew
near
and
made
*NL*
part
of
the
circle
,
settling
each
into
a
place
of
rest
as
if
of
their
*NL*
own
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
`
creatures
'
have
come
,
''
said
Colin
gravely
.
``
They
want
to
help
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
really
looked
quite
beautiful
,
Mary
thought
.
He
held
his
head
*NL*
high
as
if
he
felt
like
a
sort
of
priest
and
his
strange
eyes
had
a
*NL*
wonderful
look
in
them
.
The
light
shone
on
him
through
the
tree
canopy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
will
begin
,
''
he
said
.
``
Shall
we
sway
backward
and
forward
,
*NL*
Mary
,
as
if
we
were
dervishes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
canna
'
do
no
swayin
'
back
`
ard
and
for
`
ard
,
''
said
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
*NL*
``
I
've
got
th
'
rheumatics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Magic
will
take
them
away
,
''
said
Colin
in
a
High
Priest
tone
,
``
but
*NL*
we
wo
n't
sway
until
it
has
done
it
.
We
will
only
chant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
canna
'
do
no
chantin
'
''
said
Ben
Weatherstaff
a
trifle
testily
.
*NL*
``
They
turned
me
out
o
'
th
'
church
choir
th
'
only
time
I
ever
tried
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
smiled
.
They
were
all
too
much
in
earnest
.
Colin
's
face
was
*NL*
not
even
crossed
by
a
shadow
.
He
was
thinking
only
of
the
Magic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
will
chant
,
''
he
said
.
And
he
began
,
looking
like
a
strange
boy
*NL*
spirit
.
``
The
sun
is
shining
--
the
sun
is
shining
.
That
is
the
Magic
.
*NL*
The
flowers
are
growing
--
the
roots
are
stirring
.
That
is
the
Magic
.
*NL*
Being
alive
is
the
Magic
--
being
strong
is
the
Magic
.
The
Magic
is
in
*NL*
me
--
the
Magic
is
in
me
.
It
is
in
me
--
it
is
in
me
.
It
's
in
every
one
*NL*
of
us
.
It
's
in
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
back
.
Magic
!
Magic
!
Come
and
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
a
great
many
times
--
not
a
thousand
times
but
quite
a
goodly
*NL*
number
.
Mary
listened
entranced
.
She
felt
as
if
it
were
at
once
queer
*NL*
and
beautiful
and
she
wanted
him
to
go
on
and
on
.
Ben
Weatherstaff
*NL*
began
to
feel
soothed
into
a
sort
of
dream
which
was
quite
agreeable
.
*NL*
The
humming
of
the
bees
in
the
blossoms
mingled
with
the
chanting
voice
*NL*
and
drowsily
melted
into
a
doze
.
Dickon
sat
cross-legged
with
his
*NL*
rabbit
asleep
on
his
arm
and
a
hand
resting
on
the
lamb
's
back
.
Soot
*NL*
had
pushed
away
a
squirrel
and
huddled
close
to
him
on
his
shoulder
,
*NL*
the
gray
film
dropped
over
his
eyes
.
At
last
Colin
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
am
going
to
walk
round
the
garden
,
''
he
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
head
had
just
dropped
forward
and
he
lifted
it
with
*NL*
a
jerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
asleep
,
''
said
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nowt
o
'
th
'
sort

''
mumbled
Ben
.
``
Th
'
sermon
was
good
enow
--
but
I
'm
*NL*
bound
to
get
out
afore
th

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
quite
awake
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
in
church
,
''
said
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
me
,
''
said
Ben
,
straightening
himself
.
``
Who
said
I
were
?
I
heard
*NL*
every
bit
of
it

You
said
th

Magic

*NL*
*NL*
The
Rajah
waved
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
the
wrong
Magic
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
will
get
better

You
have
*NL*
my
permission
to
go
to
your
work

But
come
back
tomorrow

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
see
thee
walk
round
the
garden
,
''
grunted
Ben
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
an
unfriendly
grunt
,
but
it
was
a
grunt
.
In
fact
,
being
a
*NL*
stubborn
old
party
and
not
having
entire
faith
in
Magic
he
had
made
up
*NL*
his
mind
that
if
he
were
sent
away
he
would
climb
his
ladder
and
look
*NL*
over
the
wall
so
that
he
might
be
ready
to
hobble
back
if
there
were
*NL*
any
stumbling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rajah
did
not
object
to
his
staying
and
so
the
procession
was
*NL*
formed
.
It
really
did
look
like
a
procession
.
Colin
was
at
its
head
*NL*
with
Dickon
on
one
side
and
Mary
on
the
other
.
Ben
Weatherstaff
walked
*NL*
behind
,
and
the
``
creatures
''
trailed
after
them
,
the
lamb
and
the
fox
*NL*
cub
keeping
close
to
Dickon
,
the
white
rabbit
hopping
along
or
stopping
*NL*
to
nibble
and
Soot
following
with
the
solemnity
of
a
person
who
felt
*NL*
himself
in
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
procession
which
moved
slowly
but
with
dignity
.
Every
few
*NL*
yards
it
stopped
to
rest
.
Colin
leaned
on
Dickon
's
arm
and
privately
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
kept
a
sharp
lookout
,
but
now
and
then
Colin
took
his
*NL*
hand
from
its
support
and
walked
a
few
steps
alone
.
His
head
was
held
*NL*
up
all
the
time
and
he
looked
very
grand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Magic
is
in
me
!
''
he
kept
saying
.
``
The
Magic
is
making
me
strong
!
*NL*
I
can
feel
it
!
I
can
feel
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
very
certain
that
something
was
upholding
and
uplifting
him
.
*NL*
He
sat
on
the
seats
in
the
alcoves
,
and
once
or
twice
he
sat
down
on
*NL*
the
grass
and
several
times
he
paused
in
the
path
and
leaned
on
Dickon
,
*NL*
but
he
would
not
give
up
until
he
had
gone
all
round
the
garden
.
When
*NL*
he
returned
to
the
canopy
tree
his
cheeks
were
flushed
and
he
looked
*NL*
triumphant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
it
!
The
Magic
worked
!
''
he
cried
.
``
That
is
my
first
scientific
*NL*
discovery
.
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
Dr.
Craven
say
?
''
broke
out
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't
say
anything
,
''
Colin
answered
,
``
because
he
will
not
be
told
.
*NL*
This
is
to
be
the
biggest
secret
of
all
.
No
one
is
to
know
anything
*NL*
about
it
until
I
have
grown
so
strong
that
I
can
walk
and
run
like
any
*NL*
other
boy

I
shall
come
here
every
day
in
my
chair
and
I
shall
be
*NL*
taken
back
in
it
.
I
wo
n't
have
people
whispering
and
asking
questions
*NL*
and
I
wo
n't
let
my
father
hear
about
it
until
the
experiment
has
quite
*NL*
succeeded
.
Then
sometime
when
he
comes
back
to
Misselthwaite
I
shall
*NL*
just
walk
into
his
study
and
say
`
Here
I
am
;
I
am
like
any
other
boy

*NL*
I
am
quite
well
and
I
shall
live
to
be
a
man

It
has
been
done
by
a
*NL*
scientific
experiment

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
think
he
is
in
a
dream
,
''
cried
Mary
.
``
He
wo
n't
believe
his
*NL*
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
flushed
triumphantly
.
He
had
made
himself
believe
that
he
was
*NL*
going
to
get
well
,
which
was
really
more
than
half
the
battle
,
if
he
*NL*
had
been
aware
of
it
.
And
the
thought
which
stimulated
him
more
than
*NL*
any
other
was
this
imagining
what
his
father
would
look
like
when
he
*NL*
saw
that
he
had
a
son
who
was
as
straight
and
strong
as
other
fathers
'
*NL*
sons
.
One
of
his
darkest
miseries
in
the
unhealthy
morbid
past
days
*NL*
had
been
his
hatred
of
being
a
sickly
weak-backed
boy
whose
father
was
*NL*
afraid
to
look
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
be
obliged
to
believe
them
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
the
things
I
am
going
to
do

after
the
Magic

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Colin
fixed
his
eyes
on
him
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

he
said
,
``

``

Ben

touching
his
forehead
in
*NL*
salute

``
I

but
his
eyes
*NL*
twinkled
and
secretly
he
was
immensely
pleased
.
He
really
did
not
mind
*NL*
being
snubbed
since
the
snubbing
meant
that
the

was
gaining
*NL*
strength
and

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
``
LET
THEM
LAUGH
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
secret
garden
was
not
the
only
one
Dickon
worked
in
.
Round
the
*NL*
cottage
on
the
moor
there
was
a
piece
of
ground
enclosed
by
a
low
wall
*NL*
of
rough
stones
.
Early
in
the
morning
and
late
in
the
fading
twilight
*NL*
and
on
all
the
days
Colin
and
Mary
did
not
see
him
,
Dickon
worked
there
*NL*
planting
or
tending
potatoes
and
cabbages
,
turnips
and
carrots
and
*NL*
herbs
for
his
mother
.
In
the
company
of
his
``
creatures
''
he
did
wonders
*NL*
there
and
was
never
tired
of
doing
them
,
it
seemed
.
While
he
dug
or
*NL*
weeded
he
whistled
or
sang
bits
of
Yorkshire
moor
songs
or
talked
to
*NL*
Soot
or
Captain
or
the
brothers
and
sisters
he
had
taught
to
help
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'd
never
get
on
as
comfortable
as
we
do
,
''
Mrs.
Sowerby
said
,
``
if
it
*NL*
was
n't
for
Dickon
's
garden
.
Anything
'll
grow
for
him
.
His
`
taters
and
*NL*
cabbages
is
twice
th
'
size
of
any
one
else
's
an
'
they
've
got
a
flavor
*NL*
with
'em
as
nobody
's
has
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
found
a
moment
to
spare
she
liked
to
go
out
and
talk
to
him
.
*NL*
After
supper
there
was
still
a
long
clear
twilight
to
work
in
and
that
*NL*
was
her
quiet
time
.
She
could
sit
upon
the
low
rough
wall
and
look
on
*NL*
and
hear
stories
of
the
day
.
She
loved
this
time
.
There
were
not
only
*NL*
vegetables
in
this
garden
.
Dickon
had
bought
penny
packages
of
flower
*NL*
seeds
now
and
then
and
sown
bright
sweet-scented
things
among
*NL*
gooseberry
bushes
and
even
cabbages
and
he
grew
borders
of
mignonette
*NL*
and
pinks
and
pansies
and
things
whose
seeds
he
could
save
year
after
*NL*
year
or
whose
roots
would
bloom
each
spring
and
spread
in
time
into
*NL*
fine
clumps
.
The
low
wall
was
one
of
the
prettiest
things
in
Yorkshire
*NL*
because
he
had
tucked
moorland
foxglove
and
ferns
and
rock-cress
and
*NL*
hedgerow
flowers
into
every
crevice
until
only
here
and
there
glimpses
*NL*
of
the
stones
were
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
a
chap
's
got
to
do
to
make
'em
thrive
,
mother
,
''
he
would
say
,
``
is
*NL*
to
be
friends
with
'em
for
sure
.
They
're
just
like
th
'
`
creatures
.
'
If
*NL*
they
're
thirsty
give
'em
drink
and
if
they
're
hungry
give
'em
a
bit
o
'
*NL*
food
.
They
want
to
live
same
as
we
do
.
If
they
died
I
should
feel
as
*NL*
if
I
'd
been
a
bad
lad
and
somehow
treated
them
heartless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
these
twilight
hours
that
Mrs.
Sowerby
heard
of
all
that
*NL*
happened
at
Misselthwaite
Manor
.
At
first
she
was
only
told
that
*NL*
``
Mester
Colin
''
had
taken
a
fancy
to
going
out
into
the
grounds
with
*NL*
Miss
Mary
and
that
it
was
doing
him
good
.
But
it
was
not
long
before
*NL*
it
was
agreed
between
the
two
children
that
Dickon
's
mother
might
``
come
*NL*
into
the
secret
.
''
Somehow
it
was
not
doubted
that
she
was
``
safe
for
*NL*
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
one
beautiful
still
evening
Dickon
told
the
whole
story
,
with
all
*NL*
the
thrilling
details
of
the
buried
key
and
the
robin
and
the
gray
haze
*NL*
which
had
seemed
like
deadness
and
the
secret
Mistress
Mary
had
planned
*NL*
never
to
reveal
.
The
coming
of
Dickon
and
how
it
had
been
told
to
him
,
*NL*
the
doubt
of
Mester
Colin
and
the
final
drama
of
his
introduction
to
*NL*
the
hidden
domain
,
combined
with
the
incident
of
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
*NL*
angry
face
peering
over
the
wall
and
Mester
Colin
's
sudden
indignant
*NL*
strength
,
made
Mrs.
Sowerby
's
nice-looking
face
quite
change
color
*NL*
several
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
!
''
she
said
.
``
It
was
a
good
thing
that

*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
a
great
many
questions
and
her
blue
eyes
were
full
of
deep
*NL*
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

she
inquired
.

Dickon
.
``
Every

with
a
*NL*
highly
entertained
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

asked
Mrs.
Sowerby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
chuckled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
it

If

Mrs.

laughing

comfortable

before

had

finished

last
sentence

*NL*
Dickon
stopped
weeding
and
sat
up
on
his
heels
to
tell
her

His
eyes
*NL*
were
twinkling
with
fun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sowerby
laughed
so
heartily
at
the
revelation
of
this
difficulty
*NL*
that
she
quite
rocked
backward
and
forward
in
her
blue
cloak
,
and
*NL*
Dickon
laughed
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
thee
what
,
lad
,
''
Mrs.
Sowerby
said
when
she
could
speak
.
*NL*
``
I
've
thought
of
a
way
to
help
'em
.
When
tha
'
goes
to
'em
in
th

*NL*
mornin
's
tha
'
shall
take
a
pail
o

good
new
milk

I
'll
bake
'em
a
*NL*
crusty
cottage
loaf
or
some
buns
wi

currants
in
'em
,
same
as
you
*NL*
children
like
.
Nothin
's
so
good
as
fresh
milk
an
'
bread
.
Then
they
*NL*
could
take
off
th
'
edge
o
'
their
hunger
while
they
were
in
their
garden
*NL*
an
'
th
,
fine
food
they
get
indoors
`
ud
polish
off
th
'
corners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
mother
!
''
said
Dickon
admiringly
,
``
what
a
wonder
tha
'
art
!
Tha
'
*NL*
always
sees
a
way
out
o
'
things
.
They
was
quite
in
a
pother
yesterday
.
*NL*
They
did
n't
see
how
they
was
to
manage
without
orderin
'
up
more
*NL*
food
--
they
felt
that
empty
inside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
two
young
`
uns
growin
'
fast
,
an
'
health
's
comin
'
back
to
both
*NL*
of
'em
.
Children
like
that
feels
like
young
wolves
an
'
food
's
flesh
an
'
*NL*
blood
to
'em
,
''
said
Mrs.
Sowerby
.
Then
she
smiled
Dickon
's
own
curving
*NL*
smile
.
``
Eh
!
but
they
're
enjoyin
'
theirselves
for
sure
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
quite
right
,
the
comfortable
wonderful
mother
creature
--
and
she
*NL*
had
never
been
more
so
than
when
she
said
their
``
play
actin
'
''
would
be
*NL*
their
joy
.
Colin
and
Mary
found
it
one
of
their
most
thrilling
sources
*NL*
of
entertainment
.
The
idea
of
protecting
themselves
from
suspicion
had
*NL*
been
unconsciously
suggested
to
them
first
by
the
puzzled
nurse
and
*NL*
then
by
Dr.
Craven
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
appetite
.
Is
improving
very
much
,
Master
Colin
,
''
the
nurse
had
*NL*
said
one
day
.
``
You
used
to
eat
nothing
,
and
so
many
things
disagreed
*NL*
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
disagrees
with
me
now
''
replied
Colin
,
and
then
seeing
the
*NL*
nurse
looking
at
him
curiously
he
suddenly
remembered
that
perhaps
he
*NL*
ought
not
to
appear
too
well
just
yet
.
``
At
least
things
do
n't
so
often
*NL*
disagree
with
me
.
It
's
the
fresh
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
is
,
''
said
the
nurse
,
still
looking
at
him
with
a
mystified
*NL*
expression
.
``
But
I
must
talk
to
Dr.
Craven
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
she
stared
at
you
!
''
said
Mary
when
she
went
away
.
``
As
if
she
*NL*
thought
there
must
be
something
to
find
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
have
her
finding
out
things
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
No
one
must
begin
*NL*
to
find
out
yet
.
''
When
Dr.
Craven
came
that
morning
he
seemed
puzzled
,
*NL*
also
.
He
asked
a
number
of
questions
,
to
Colin
's
great
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
stay
out
in
the
garden
a
great
deal
,
''
he
suggested
.
``
Where
do
you
*NL*
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
put
on
his
favorite
air
of
dignified
indifference
to
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
let
any
one
know
where
I
go
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
go
to
a
*NL*
place
I
like
.
Every
one
has
orders
to
keep
out
of
the
way
.
I
wo
n't
be
*NL*
watched
and
stared
at
.
You
know
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
be
out
all
day
but
I
do
not
think
it
has
done
you
harm
--
I
*NL*
do
not
think
so
.
The
nurse
says
that
you
eat
much
more
than
you
have
*NL*
ever
done
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Colin
,
prompted
by
a
sudden
inspiration
,
``
perhaps
it
is
*NL*
an
unnatural
appetite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
so
,
as
your
food
seems
to
agree
with
you
,
''
said
Dr.
*NL*
Craven
.
``
You
are
gaining
flesh
rapidly
and
your
color
is
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
--
perhaps
I
am
bloated
and
feverish
,
''
said
Colin
,
assuming
a
*NL*
discouraging
air
of
gloom
.
``
People
who
are
not
going
to
live
are
*NL*
often
--
different
.
''
Dr.
Craven
shook
his
head
.
He
was
holding
Colin
's
*NL*
wrist
and
he
pushed
up
his
sleeve
and
felt
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
feverish
,
''
he
said
thoughtfully
,
``
and
such
flesh
as
you
*NL*
have
gained
is
healthy
.
If
you
can
keep
this
up
,
my
boy
,
we
need
not
*NL*
talk
of
dying
.
Your
father
will
be
happy
to
hear
of
this
remarkable
*NL*
improvement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
have
him
told
!
''
Colin
broke
forth
fiercely
.
``
It
will
only
*NL*
disappoint
him
if
I
get
worse
again
--
and
I
may
get
worse
this
very
*NL*
night
.
I
might
have
a
raging
fever
.
I
feel
as
if
I
might
be
beginning
*NL*
to
have
one
now
.
I
wo
n't
have
letters
written
to
my
father
--
I
wo
n't
--
I
*NL*
wo
n't
!
You
are
making
me
angry
and
you
know
that
is
bad
for
me
.
I
*NL*
feel
hot
already
.
I
hate
being
written
about
and
being
talked
over
as
*NL*
much
as
I
hate
being
stared
at
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush-h
!
my
boy
,
''
Dr.
Craven
soothed
him
.
``
Nothing
shall
be
written
*NL*
without
your
permission
.
You
are
too
sensitive
about
things
.
You
must
*NL*
not
undo
the
good
which
has
been
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
no
more
about
writing
to
Mr.
Craven
and
when
he
saw
the
nurse
*NL*
he
privately
warned
her
that
such
a
possibility
must
not
be
mentioned
*NL*
to
the
patient
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
boy
is
extraordinarily
better
,
''
he
said
.
``
His
advance
seems
*NL*
almost
abnormal
.
But
of
course
he
is
doing
now
of
his
own
free
will
*NL*
what
we
could
not
make
him
do
before
.
Still
,
he
excites
himself
very
*NL*
easily
and
nothing
must
be
said
to
irritate
him
.
''
Mary
and
Colin
were
*NL*
much
alarmed
and
talked
together
anxiously
.
From
this
time
dated
their
*NL*
plan
of
``
play
actin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
be
obliged
to
have
a
tantrum
,
''
said
Colin
regretfully
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
have
one
and
I
'm
not
miserable
enough
now
to
work
myself
into
a
*NL*
big
one
.
Perhaps
I
could
n't
have
one
at
all
.
That
lump
does
n't
come
*NL*
in
my
throat
now
and
I
keep
thinking
of
nice
things
instead
of
horrible
*NL*
ones
.
But
if
they
talk
about
writing
to
my
father
I
shall
have
to
do
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
up
his
mind
to
eat
less
,
but
unfortunately
it
was
not
possible
*NL*
to
carry
out
this
brilliant
idea
when
he
wakened
each
morning
with
an
*NL*
amazing
appetite
and
the
table
near
his
sofa
was
set
with
a
breakfast
*NL*
of
home-made
bread
and
fresh
butter
,
snow-white
eggs
,
raspberry
jam
and
*NL*
clotted
cream
.
Mary
always
breakfasted
with
him
and
when
they
found
*NL*
themselves
at
the
table
--
particularly
if
there
were
delicate
slices
of
*NL*
sizzling
ham
sending
forth
tempting
odors
from
under
a
hot
silver
*NL*
cover
--
they
would
look
into
each
other
's
eyes
in
desperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
we
shall
have
to
eat
it
all
this
morning
,
Mary
,
''
Colin
always
*NL*
ended
by
saying
.
``
We
can
send
away
some
of
the
lunch
and
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
the
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
never
found
they
could
send
away
anything
and
the
highly
*NL*
polished
condition
of
the
empty
plates
returned
to
the
pantry
awakened
*NL*
much
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
wish
,
''
Colin
would
say
also
,
``
I
do
wish
the
slices
of
ham
were
*NL*
thicker
,
and
one
muffin
each
is
not
enough
for
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
enough
for
a
person
who
is
going
to
die
,
''
answered
Mary
when
*NL*
first
she
heard
this
,
``
but
it
's
not
enough
for
a
person
who
is
going
to
*NL*
live
.
I
sometimes
feel
as
if
I
could
eat
three
when
those
nice
fresh
*NL*
heather
and
gorse
smells
from
the
moor
come
pouring
in
at
the
open
*NL*
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
that
Dickon
--
after
they
had
been
enjoying
themselves
in
the
*NL*
garden
for
about
two
hours
--
went
behind
a
big
rosebush
and
brought
*NL*
forth
two
tin
pails
and
revealed
that
one
was
full
of
rich
new
milk
*NL*
with
cream
on
the
top
of
it
,
and
that
the
other
held
cottage-made
*NL*
currant
buns
folded
in
a
clean
blue
and
white
napkin
,
buns
so
carefully
*NL*
tucked
in
that
they
were
still
hot
,
there
was
a
riot
of
surprised
*NL*
joyfulness
.
What
a
wonderful
thing
for
Mrs.
Sowerby
to
think
of
!
What
*NL*
a
kind
,
clever
woman
she
must
be
!
How
good
the
buns
were
!
And
what
*NL*
delicious
fresh
milk
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Magic
is
in
her
just
as
it
is
in
Dickon
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
It
makes
her
*NL*
think
of
ways
to
do
things
--
nice
things
.
She
is
a
Magic
person
.
Tell
*NL*
her
we
are
grateful
,
Dickon
--
extremely
grateful
.
''
He
was
given
to
using
*NL*
rather
grown-up
phrases
at
times
.
He
enjoyed
them
.
He
liked
this
so
*NL*
much
that
he
improved
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
her
she
has
been
most
bounteous
and
our
gratitude
is
extreme
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
forgetting
his
grandeur
he
fell
to
and
stuffed
himself
with
*NL*
buns
and
drank
milk
out
of
the
pail
in
copious
draughts
in
the
manner
*NL*
of
any
hungry
little
boy
who
had
been
taking
unusual
exercise
and
*NL*
breathing
in
moorland
air
and
whose
breakfast
was
more
than
two
hours
*NL*
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
beginning
of
many
agreeable
incidents
of
the
same
kind
.
*NL*
They
actually
awoke
to
the
fact
that
as
Mrs.
Sowerby
had
fourteen
*NL*
people
to
provide
food
for
she
might
not
have
enough
to
satisfy
two
*NL*
extra
appetites
every
day
.
So
they
asked
her
to
let
them
send
some
of
*NL*
their
shillings
to
buy
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
made
the
stimulating
discovery
that
in
the
wood
in
the
park
*NL*
outside
the
garden
where
Mary
had
first
found
him
piping
to
the
wild
*NL*
creatures
there
was
a
deep
little
hollow
where
you
could
build
a
sort
*NL*
of
tiny
oven
with
stones
and
roast
potatoes
and
eggs
in
it
.
Roasted
*NL*
eggs
were
a
previously
unknown
luxury
and
very
hot
potatoes
with
salt
*NL*
and
fresh
butter
in
them
were
fit
for
a
woodland
king
--
besides
being
*NL*
deliciously
satisfying
.
You
could
buy
both
potatoes
and
eggs
and
eat
*NL*
as
many
as
you
liked
without
feeling
as
if
you
were
taking
food
out
of
*NL*
the
mouths
of
fourteen
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
beautiful
morning
the
Magic
was
worked
by
the
mystic
circle
under
*NL*
the
plum-tree
which
provided
a
canopy
of
thickening
green
leaves
after
*NL*
its
brief
blossom-time
was
ended
.
After
the
ceremony
Colin
always
took
*NL*
his
walking
exercise
and
throughout
the
day
he
exercised
his
newly
*NL*
found
power
at
intervals
.
Each
day
he
grew
stronger
and
could
walk
*NL*
more
steadily
and
cover
more
ground
.
And
each
day
his
belief
in
the
*NL*
Magic
grew
stronger
--
as
well
it
might
.
He
tried
one
experiment
after
*NL*
another
as
he
felt
himself
gaining
strength
and
it
was
Dickon
who
*NL*
showed
him
the
best
things
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
,
''
he
said
one
morning
after
an
absence
,
``
I
went
to
Thwaite

for

I
axed

Th

calls

I
thought

thee

I
did

A
strong
man
in

that
came

to

showed
me
how

*NL*
*NL*
Colin
had
been
listening
excitedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

he
cried
.
``
Will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
to
be
sure
,
''
Dickon
answered
,
getting
up
.
``
But
he
says
tha
'
mun
*NL*
do
'em
gentle
at
first
an
'
be
careful
not
to
tire
thysel

.
Rest
in
*NL*
between
times
an
'
take
deep
breaths
an
'
do
n't
overdo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
careful
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
Show
me
!
Show
me
!
Dickon
,
you
are
the
*NL*
most
Magic
boy
in
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
stood
up
on
the
grass
and
slowly
went
through
a
carefully
*NL*
practical
but
simple
series
of
muscle
exercises
.
Colin
watched
them
*NL*
with
widening
eyes
.
He
could
do
a
few
while
he
was
sitting
down
.
*NL*
Presently
he
did
a
few
gently
while
he
stood
upon
his
already
steadied
*NL*
feet
.
Mary
began
to
do
them
also
.
Soot
,
who
was
watching
the
*NL*
performance
,
became
much
disturbed
and
left
his
branch
and
hopped
about
*NL*
restlessly
because
he
could
not
do
them
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
time
the
exercises
were
part
of
the
day
's
duties
as
much
as
*NL*
the
Magic
was
.
It
became
possible
for
both
Colin
and
Mary
to
do
more
*NL*
of
them
each
time
they
tried
,
and
such
appetites
were
the
results
that
*NL*
but
for
the
basket
Dickon
put
down
behind
the
bush
each
morning
when
he
*NL*
arrived
they
would
have
been
lost
.
But
the
little
oven
in
the
hollow
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Sowerby
's
bounties
were
so
satisfying
that
Mrs.
Medlock
and
*NL*
the
nurse
and
Dr.
Craven
became
mystified
again
.
You
can
trifle
with
*NL*
your
breakfast
and
seem
to
disdain
your
dinner
if
you
are
full
to
the
*NL*
brim
with
roasted
eggs
and
potatoes
and
richly
frothed
new
milk
and
*NL*
oatcakes
and
buns
and
heather
honey
and
clotted
cream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
eating
next
to
nothing
,
''
said
the
nurse
.
``
They
'll
die
of
*NL*
starvation
if
they
ca
n't
be
persuaded
to
take
some
nourishment
.
And
*NL*
yet
see
how
they
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Medlock
indignantly
.
``
Eh
!
I
'm
moithered
to
*NL*
death
with
them
.
They
're
a
pair
of
young
Satans
.
Bursting
their
*NL*
jackets
one
day
and
the
next
turning
up
their
noses
at
the
best
meals
*NL*
Cook
can
tempt
them
with
.
Not
a
mouthful
of
that
lovely
young
fowl
and
*NL*
bread
sauce
did
they
set
a
fork
into
yesterday
--
and
the
poor
woman
fair
*NL*
invented
a
pudding
for
them
--
and
back
it
's
sent
.
She
almost
cried
.
*NL*
She
's
afraid
she
'll
be
blamed
if
they
starve
themselves
into
their
*NL*
graves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Craven
came
and
looked
at
Colin
long
and
carefully
,
He
wore
an
*NL*
extremely
worried
expression
when
the
nurse
talked
with
him
and
showed
*NL*
him
the
almost
untouched
tray
of
breakfast
she
had
saved
for
him
to
*NL*
look
at
--
but
it
was
even
more
worried
when
he
sat
down
by
Colin
's
sofa
*NL*
and
examined
him
.
He
had
been
called
to
London
on
business
and
had
not
*NL*
seen
the
boy
for
nearly
two
weeks
.
When
young
things
begin
to
gain
*NL*
health
they
gain
it
rapidly
.
The
waxen
tinge
had
left
,
Colins
skin
and
*NL*
a
warm
rose
showed
through
it
;
his
beautiful
eyes
were
clear
and
the
*NL*
hollows
under
them
and
in
his
cheeks
and
temples
had
filled
out
.
His
*NL*
once
dark
,
heavy
locks
had
begun
to
look
as
if
they
sprang
healthily
*NL*
from
his
forehead
and
were
soft
and
warm
with
life
.
His
lips
were
*NL*
fuller
and
of
a
normal
color
.
In
fact
as
an
imitation
of
a
boy
who
was
*NL*
a
confirmed
invalid
he
was
a
disgraceful
sight
.
Dr.
Craven
held
his
*NL*
chin
in
his
hand
and
thought
him
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
hear
that
you
do
not
eat
anything
,
''
he
said
.
``
That
will
*NL*
not
do
.
You
will
lose
all
you
have
gained
--
and
you
have
gained
*NL*
amazingly
.
You
ate
so
well
a
short
time
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
it
was
an
unnatural
appetite
,
''
answered
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
was
sitting
on
her
stool
nearby
and
she
suddenly
made
a
very
queer
*NL*
sound
which
she
tried
so
violently
to
repress
that
she
ended
by
almost
*NL*
choking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
said
Dr.
Craven
,
turning
to
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
became
quite
severe
in
her
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
something
between
a
sneeze
and
a
cough
,
''
she
replied
with
*NL*
reproachful
dignity
,
``
and
it
got
into
my
throat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
she
said
afterward
to
Colin
,
``
I
could
n't
stop
myself
.
It
just
*NL*
burst
out
because
all
at
once
I
could
n't
help
remembering
that
last
big
*NL*
potato
you
ate
and
the
way
your
mouth
stretched
when
you
bit
through
*NL*
that
thick
lovely
crust
with
jam
and
clotted
cream
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
way
in
which
those
children
can
get
food
secretly
?
''
Dr.
*NL*
Craven
inquired
of
Mrs.
Medlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
way
unless
they
dig
it
out
of
the
earth
or
pick
it
off
the
*NL*
trees
,
''
Mrs.
Medlock
answered
.
``
They
stay
out
in
the
grounds
all
day
*NL*
and
see
no
one
but
each
other
.
And
if
they
want
anything
different
to
*NL*
eat
from
what
's
sent
up
to
them
they
need
only
ask
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Dr.
Craven
,
``
so
long
as
going
without
food
agrees
with
*NL*
them
we
need
not
disturb
ourselves
.
The
boy
is
a
new
creature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
is
the
girl
,
''
said
Mrs.
Medlock
.
``
She
's
begun
to
be
downright
*NL*
pretty
since
she
's
filled
out
and
lost
her
ugly
little
sour
look
.
Her
*NL*
hair
's
grown
thick
and
healthy
looking
and
she
's
got
a
bright
color
.
*NL*
The
glummest
,
ill-natured
little
thing
she
used
to
be
and
now
her
and
*NL*
Master
Colin
laugh
together
like
a
pair
of
crazy
young
ones
.
Perhaps
*NL*
they
're
growing
fat
on
that
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
they
are

said
Dr.
Craven

``
Let
them
laugh

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
THE
CURTAIN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
secret
garden
bloomed
and
bloomed
and
every
morning
revealed
*NL*
new
miracles
.
In
the
robin
's
nest
there
were
Eggs
and
the
robin
's
mate
*NL*
sat
upon
them
keeping
them
warm
with
her
feathery
little
breast
and
*NL*
careful
wings
.
At
first
she
was
very
nervous
and
the
robin
himself
was
*NL*
indignantly
watchful
.
Even
Dickon
did
not
go
near
the
close-grown
*NL*
corner
in
those
days
,
but
waited
until
by
the
quiet
working
of
some
*NL*
mysterious
spell
he
seemed
to
have
conveyed
to
the
soul
of
the
little
*NL*
pair
that
in
the
garden
there
was
nothing
which
was
not
quite
like
*NL*
themselves
--
nothing
which
did
not
understand
the
wonderfulness
of
what
*NL*
was
happening
to
them
--
the
immense
,
tender
,
terrible
,
heart-breaking
*NL*
beauty
and
solemnity
of
Eggs
.
If
there
had
been
one
person
in
that
*NL*
garden
who
had
not
known
through
all
his
or
her
innermost
being
that
if
*NL*
an
Egg
were
taken
away
or
hurt
the
whole
world
would
whirl
round
and
*NL*
crash
through
space
and
come
to
an
end
--
if
there
had
been
even
one
who
*NL*
did
not
feel
it
and
act
accordingly
there
could
have
been
no
happiness
*NL*
even
in
that
golden
springtime
air
.
But
they
all
knew
it
and
felt
it
*NL*
and
the
robin
and
his
mate
knew
they
knew
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
the
robin
watched
Mary
and
Colin
with
sharp
anxiety
.
For
some
*NL*
mysterious
reason
he
knew
he
need
not
watch
Dickon
.
The
first
moment
*NL*
he
set
his
dew-bright
black
eye
on
Dickon
he
knew
he
was
not
a
stranger
*NL*
but
a
sort
of
robin
without
beak
or
feathers
.
He
could
speak
robin
*NL*
-LRB-
which
is
a
quite
distinct
language
not
to
be
mistaken
for
any
other
-RRB-
.
*NL*
To
speak
robin
to
a
robin
is
like
speaking
French
to
a
Frenchman
.
*NL*
Dickon
always
spoke
it
to
the
robin
himself
,
so
the
queer
gibberish
he
*NL*
used
when
he
spoke
to
humans
did
not
matter
in
the
least
.
The
robin
*NL*
thought
he
spoke
this
gibberish
to
them
because
they
were
not
*NL*
intelligent
enough
to
understand
feathered
speech
.
His
movements
also
*NL*
were
robin
.
They
never
startled
one
by
being
sudden
enough
to
seem
*NL*
dangerous
or
threatening
.
Any
robin
could
understand
Dickon
,
so
his
*NL*
presence
was
not
even
disturbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
outset
it
seemed
necessary
to
be
on
guard
against
the
other
*NL*
two
.
In
the
first
place
the
boy
creature
did
not
come
into
the
garden
*NL*
on
his
legs
.
He
was
pushed
in
on
a
thing
with
wheels
and
the
skins
of
*NL*
wild
animals
were
thrown
over
him
.
That
in
itself
was
doubtful
.
Then
*NL*
when
he
began
to
stand
up
and
move
about
he
did
it
in
a
queer
*NL*
unaccustomed
way
and
the
others
seemed
to
have
to
help
him
.
The
robin
*NL*
used
to
secrete
himself
in
a
bush
and
watch
this
anxiously
,
his
head
*NL*
tilted
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
.
He
thought
that
the
*NL*
slow
movements
might
mean
that
he
was
preparing
to
pounce
,
as
cats
do
.
*NL*
When
cats
are
preparing
to
pounce
they
creep
over
the
ground
very
*NL*
slowly
.
The
robin
talked
this
over
with
his
mate
a
great
deal
for
a
*NL*
few
days
but
after
that
he
decided
not
to
speak
of
the
subject
because
*NL*
her
terror
was
so
great
that
he
was
afraid
it
might
be
injurious
to
the
*NL*
Eggs
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
boy
began
to
walk
by
himself
and
even
to
move
more
quickly
it
*NL*
was
an
immense
relief
.
But
for
a
long
time
--
or
it
seemed
a
long
time
*NL*
to
the
robin
--
he
was
a
source
of
some
anxiety
.
He
did
not
act
as
the
*NL*
other
humans
did
.
He
seemed
very
fond
of
walking
but
he
had
a
way
of
*NL*
sitting
or
lying
down
for
a
while
and
then
getting
up
in
a
*NL*
disconcerting
manner
to
begin
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
the
robin
remembered
that
when
he
himself
had
been
made
to
*NL*
learn
to
fly
by
his
parents
he
had
done
much
the
same
sort
of
thing
.
*NL*
He
had
taken
short
flights
of
a
few
yards
and
then
had
been
obliged
to
*NL*
rest
.
So
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
boy
was
learning
to
fly
--
or
*NL*
rather
to
walk
.
He
mentioned
this
to
his
mate
and
when
he
told
her
*NL*
that
the
Eggs
would
probably
conduct
themselves
in
the
same
way
after
*NL*
they
were
fledged
she
was
quite
comforted
and
even
became
eagerly
*NL*
interested
and
derived
great
pleasure
from
watching
the
boy
over
the
*NL*
edge
of
her
nest
--
though
she
always
thought
that
the
Eggs
would
be
much
*NL*
cleverer
and
learn
more
quickly
.
But
then
she
said
indulgently
that
*NL*
humans
were
always
more
clumsy
and
slow
than
Eggs
and
most
of
them
*NL*
never
seemed
really
to
learn
to
fly
at
all
.
You
never
met
them
in
the
*NL*
air
or
on
tree-tops
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
the
boy
began
to
move
about
as
the
others
did
,
but
all
*NL*
three
of
the
children
at
times
did
unusual
things
.
They
would
stand
*NL*
under
the
trees
and
move
their
arms
and
legs
and
heads
about
in
a
way
*NL*
which
was
neither
walking
nor
running
nor
sitting
down
.
They
went
*NL*
through
these
movements
at
intervals
every
day
and
the
robin
was
never
*NL*
able
to
explain
to
his
mate
what
they
were
doing
or
tying
to
do
.
He
*NL*
could
only
say
that
he
was
sure
that
the
Eggs
would
never
flap
about
in
*NL*
such
a
manner
;
but
as
the
boy
who
could
speak
robin
so
fluently
was
*NL*
doing
the
thing
with
them
,
birds
could
be
quite
sure
that
the
actions
*NL*
were
not
of
a
dangerous
nature
.
Of
course
neither
the
robin
nor
his
*NL*
mate
had
ever
heard
of
the
champion
wrestler
,
Bob
Haworth
,
and
his
*NL*
exercises
for
making
the
muscles
stand
out
like
lumps
.
Robins
are
not
*NL*
like
human
beings
;
their
muscles
are
always
exercised
from
the
first
*NL*
and
so
they
develop
themselves
in
a
natural
manner
.
If
you
have
to
fly
*NL*
about
to
find
every
meal
you
eat
,
your
muscles
do
not
become
atrophied
*NL*
-LRB-
atrophied
means
wasted
away
through
want
of
use
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
boy
was
walking
and
running
about
and
digging
and
weeding
like
*NL*
the
others
,
the
nest
in
the
corner
was
brooded
over
by
a
great
peace
*NL*
and
content
.
Fears
for
the
Eggs
became
things
of
the
past
.
Knowing
*NL*
that
your
Eggs
were
as
safe
as
if
they
were
locked
in
a
bank
vault
and
*NL*
the
fact
that
you
could
watch
so
many
curious
things
going
on
made
*NL*
setting
a
most
entertaining
occupation
.
On
wet
days
the
Eggs
'
mother
*NL*
sometimes
felt
even
a
little
dull
because
the
children
did
not
come
*NL*
into
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
on
wet
days
it
could
not
be
said
that
Mary
and
Colin
were
*NL*
dull
.
One
morning
when
the
rain
streamed
down
unceasingly
and
Colin
*NL*
was
beginning
to
feel
a
little
restive
,
as
he
was
obliged
to
remain
on
*NL*
his
sofa
because
it
was
not
safe
to
get
up
and
walk
about
,
Mary
had
an
*NL*
inspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
I
am
a
real
boy
,
''
Colin
had
said
,
``
my
legs
and
arms
and
all
*NL*
my
body
are
so
full
of
Magic
that
I
ca
n't
keep
them
still
.
They
want
*NL*
to
be
doing
things
all
the
time
.
Do
you
know
that
when
I
waken
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
Mary
,
when
it
's
quite
early
and
the
birds
are
just
shouting
*NL*
outside
and
everything
seems
just
shouting
for
joy
--
even
the
trees
and
*NL*
things
we
ca
n't
really
hear
--
I
feel
as
if
I
must
jump
out
of
bed
and
*NL*
shout
myself
.
If
I
did
it
,
just
think
what
would
happen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
giggled
inordinately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
nurse
would
come
running
and
Mrs.
Medlock
would
come
running
and
*NL*
they
would
be
sure
you
had
gone
crazy
and
they
'd
send
for
the
doctor
,
''
*NL*
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
giggled
himself
.
He
could
see
how
they
would
all
look
--
how
*NL*
horrified
by
his
outbreak
and
how
amazed
to
see
him
standing
upright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
my
father
would
come
home
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
want
to
tell
him
*NL*
myself
.
I
'm
always
thinking
about
it
--
but
we
could
n't
go
on
like
this
*NL*
much
longer
.
I
ca
n't
stand
lying
still
and
pretending
,
and
besides
I
*NL*
look
too
different
.
I
wish
it
was
n't
raining
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
then
Mistress
Mary
had
her
inspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colin
,
''
she
began
mysteriously
,
``
do
you
know
how
many
rooms
there
are
*NL*
in
this
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
a
thousand
,
I
suppose
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
about
a
hundred
no
one
ever
goes
into
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
And
one
*NL*
rainy
day
I
went
and
looked
into
ever
so
many
of
them
.
No
one
ever
*NL*
knew
,
though
Mrs.
Medlock
nearly
found
me
out
.
I
lost
my
way
when
I
*NL*
was
coming
back
and
I
stopped
at
the
end
of
your
corridor
.
That
was
*NL*
the
second
time
I
heard
you
crying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
started
up
on
his
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hundred
rooms
no
one
goes
into
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
sounds
almost
like
a
*NL*
secret
garden
.
Suppose
we
go
and
look
at
them
.
Wheel
me
in
my
chair
*NL*
and
nobody
would
know
we
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
was
thinking
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
No
one
would
dare
to
follow
*NL*
us
.
There
are
galleries
where
you
could
run
.
We
could
do
our
*NL*
exercises
.
There
is
a
little
Indian
room
where
there
is
a
cabinet
full
*NL*
of
ivory
elephants
.
There
are
all
sorts
of
rooms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ring
the
bell
,
''
said
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
nurse
came
in
he
gave
his
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
my
chair
,
''
he
said
.
``
Miss
Mary
and
I
are
going
to
look
at
the
*NL*
part
of
the
house
which
is
not
used
.
John
can
push
me
as
far
as
the
*NL*
picture-gallery
because
there
are
some
stairs
.
Then
he
must
go
away
*NL*
and
leave
us
alone
until
I
send
for
him
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rainy
days
lost
their
terrors
that
morning
.
When
the
footman
had
*NL*
wheeled
the
chair
into
the
picture-gallery
and
left
the
two
together
in
*NL*
obedience
to
orders
,
Colin
and
Mary
looked
at
each
other
delighted
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
Mary
had
made
sure
that
John
was
really
on
his
way
back
to
his
*NL*
own
quarters
below
stairs
,
Colin
got
out
of
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
run
from
one
end
of
the
gallery
to
the
other
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
and
then
I
am
going
to
jump
and
then
we
will
do
Bob
Haworth
's
*NL*
exercises
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
did
all
these
things
and
many
others
.
They
looked
at
the
*NL*
portraits
and
found
the
plain
little
girl
dressed
in
green
brocade
and
*NL*
holding
the
parrot
on
her
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
these
,
''
said
Colin
,
``
must
be
my
relations
.
They
lived
a
long
time
*NL*
ago
.
That
parrot
one
,
I
believe
,
is
one
of
my
great
,
great
,
great
,
*NL*
great
aunts
.
She
looks
rather
like
you
,
Mary
--
not
as
you
look
now
but
*NL*
as
you
looked
when
you
came
here
.
Now
you
are
a
great
deal
fatter
and
*NL*
better
looking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
are
you
,
''
said
Mary
,
and
they
both
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
to
the
Indian
room
and
amused
themselves
with
the
ivory
*NL*
elephants
.
They
found
the
rose-colored
brocade
boudoir
and
the
hole
in
*NL*
the
cushion
the
mouse
had
left
,
but
the
mice
had
grown
up
and
run
away
*NL*
and
the
hole
was
empty
.
They
saw
more
rooms
and
made
more
discoveries
*NL*
than
Mary
had
made
on
her
first
pilgrimage
.
They
found
new
corridors
*NL*
and
corners
and
flights
of
steps
and
new
old
pictures
they
liked
and
*NL*
weird
old
things
they
did
not
know
the
use
of
.
It
was
a
curiously
*NL*
entertaining
morning
and
the
feeling
of
wandering
about
in
the
same
*NL*
house
with
other
people
but
at
the
same
time
feeling
as
if
one
were
*NL*
miles
away
from
them
was
a
fascinating
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
we
came
,
''
Colin
said
.
``
I
never
knew
I
lived
in
such
a
big
*NL*
queer
old
place
.
I
like
it
.
We
will
ramble
about
every
rainy
day
.
We
*NL*
shall
always
be
finding
new
queer
corners
and
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
morning
they
had
found
among
other
things
such
good
appetites
that
*NL*
when
they
returned
to
Colin
's
room
it
was
not
possible
to
send
the
*NL*
luncheon
away
untouched
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
nurse
carried
the
tray
down-stairs
she
slapped
it
down
on
the
*NL*
kitchen
dresser
so
that
Mrs.
Loomis
,
the
cook
,
could
see
the
highly
*NL*
polished
dishes
and
plates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
that
!
''
she
said
.
``
This
is
a
house
of
mystery
,
and
those
two
*NL*
children
are
the
greatest
mysteries
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
keep
that
up
every
day
,
''
said
the
strong
young
footman
John
,
*NL*
``
there
'd
be
small
wonder
that
he
weighs
twice
as
much
to-day
as
he
did
*NL*
a
month
ago
.
I
should
have
to
give
up
my
place
in
time
,
for
fear
of
*NL*
doing
my
muscles
an
injury
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
afternoon
Mary
noticed
that
something
new
had
happened
in
Colin
's
*NL*
room
.
She
had
noticed
it
the
day
before
but
had
said
nothing
because
*NL*
she
thought
the
change
might
have
been
made
by
chance
.
She
said
*NL*
nothing
today
but
she
sat
and
looked
fixedly
at
the
picture
over
the
*NL*
mantel
.
She
could
look
at
it
because
the
curtain
had
been
drawn
aside
.
*NL*
That
was
the
change
she
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
you
want
me
to
tell
you
,
''
said
Colin
,
after
she
had
stared
*NL*
a
few
minutes
.
``
I
always
know
when
you
want
me
to
tell
you
something
.
*NL*
You
are
wondering
why
the
curtain
is
drawn
back
.
I
am
going
to
keep
it
*NL*
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
asked
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
does
n't
make
me
angry
any
more
to
see
her
laughing
.
I
*NL*
wakened
when
it
was
bright
moonlight
two
nights
ago
and
felt
as
if
the
*NL*
Magic
was
filling
the
room
and
making
everything
so
splendid
that
I
*NL*
could
n't
lie
still
.
I
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
.
The
room
*NL*
was
quite
light
and
there
was
a
patch
of
moonlight
on
the
curtain
and
*NL*
somehow
that
made
me
go
and
pull
the
cord
.
She
looked
right
down
at
me
*NL*
as
if
she
were
laughing
because
she
was
glad
I
was
standing
there
.
It
*NL*
made
me
like
to
look
at
her
.
I
want
to
see
her
laughing
like
that
all
*NL*
the
time
.
I
think
she
must
have
been
a
sort
of
Magic
person
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
so
like
her
now
,
''
said
Mary
,
``
that
sometimes
I
think
perhaps
*NL*
you
are
her
ghost
made
into
a
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
idea
seemed
to
impress
Colin
.
He
thought
it
over
and
then
*NL*
answered
her
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
her
ghost
--
my
father
would
be
fond
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
him
to
be
fond
of
you
?
''
inquired
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
hate
it
because
he
was
not
fond
of
me
.
If
he
grew
fond
of
*NL*
me
I
think
I
should
tell
him
about
the
Magic
.
It
might
make
him
more
*NL*
cheerful
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
``
IT
'S
MOTHER
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Their
belief
in
the
Magic
was
an
abiding
thing
.
After
the
morning
's
*NL*
incantations
Colin
sometimes
gave
them
Magic
lectures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
to
do
it
,
''
he
explained
,
``
because
when
I
grow
up
and
make
great
*NL*
scientific
discoveries
I
shall
be
obliged
to
lecture
about
them
and
so
*NL*
this
is
practise
.
I
can
only
give
short
lectures
now
because
I
am
very
*NL*
young
,
and
besides
Ben
Weatherstaff
would
feel
as
if
he
were
in
church
*NL*
and
he
would
go
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Th
'
best
thing
about
lecturin
'
,
''
said
Ben
,
``
is
that
a
chap
can
get
up
*NL*
an
'
say
aught
he
pleases
an
'
no
other
chap
can
answer
him
back
.
I
*NL*
would
n't
be
agen
'
lecturin
'
a
bit
mysel
'
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Colin
held
forth
under
his
tree
old
Ben
fixed
devouring
eyes
*NL*
on
him
and
kept
them
there
.
He
looked
him
over
with
critical
*NL*
affection
.
It
was
not
so
much
the
lecture
which
interested
him
as
the
*NL*
legs
which
looked
straighter
and
stronger
each
day
,
the
boyish
head
*NL*
which
held
itself
up
so
well
,
the
once
sharp
chin
and
hollow
cheeks
*NL*
which
had
filled
and
rounded
out
and
the
eyes
which
had
begun
to
hold
*NL*
the
light
he
remembered
in
another
pair
.
Sometimes
when
Colin
felt
*NL*
Ben
's
earnest
gaze
meant
that
he
was
much
impressed
he
wondered
what
he
*NL*
was
reflecting
on
and
once
when
he
had
seemed
quite
entranced
he
*NL*
questioned
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking
about
,
Ben
Weatherstaff
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinkin
'
''
answered
Ben
,
``
as
I
'd
warrant
tha
's
,
gone
up
three
or
*NL*
four
pound
this
week
.
I
was
lookin
'
at
tha
'
calves
an
'
tha
'
shoulders
.
*NL*
I
'd
like
to
get
thee
on
a
pair
o
'
scales
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
Magic
and
--
and
Mrs.
Sowerby
's
buns
and
milk
and
things
,
''
said
*NL*
Colin
.
``
You
see
the
scientific
experiment
has
succeeded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
morning
Dickon
was
too
late
to
hear
the
lecture
.
When
he
came
he
*NL*
was
ruddy
with
running
and
his
funny
face
looked
more
twinkling
than
*NL*
usual
.
As
they
had
a
good
deal
of
weeding
to
do
after
the
rains
they
*NL*
fell
to
work
.
They
always
had
plenty
to
do
after
a
warm
deep
sinking
*NL*
rain
.
The
moisture
which
was
good
for
the
flowers
was
also
good
for
*NL*
the
weeds
which
thrust
up
tiny
blades
of
grass
and
points
of
leaves
*NL*
which
must
be
pulled
up
before
their
roots
took
too
firm
hold
.
Colin
*NL*
was
as
good
at
weeding
as
any
one
in
these
days
and
he
could
lecture
*NL*
while
he
was
doing
it
.
``
The
Magic
works
best
when
you
work
,
yourself
,
''
*NL*
he
said
this
morning
.
``
You
can
feel
it
in
your
bones
and
muscles
.
I
*NL*
am
going
to
read
books
about
bones
and
muscles
,
but
I
am
going
to
write
*NL*
a
book
about
Magic
.
I
am
making
it
up
now
.
I
keep
finding
out
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
very
long
after
he
had
said
this
that
he
laid
down
his
*NL*
trowel
and
stood
up
on
his
feet
.
He
had
been
silent
for
several
*NL*
minutes
and
they
had
seen
that
he
was
thinking
out
lectures
,
as
he
*NL*
often
did
.
When
he
dropped
his
trowel
and
stood
upright
it
seemed
to
*NL*
Mary
and
Dickon
as
if
a
sudden
strong
thought
had
made
him
do
it
.
He
*NL*
stretched
himself
out
to
his
tallest
height
and
he
threw
out
his
arms
*NL*
exultantly
.
Color
glowed
in
his
face
and
his
strange
eyes
widened
with
*NL*
joyfulness
.
All
at
once
he
had
realized
something
to
the
full
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
!
Dickon
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Just
look
at
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stopped
their
weeding
and
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
that
first
morning
you
brought
me
in
here
?
''
he
*NL*
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
was
looking
at
him
very
hard
.
Being
an
animal
charmer
he
could
*NL*
see
more
things
than
most
people
could
and
many
of
them
were
things
he
*NL*
never
talked
about
.
He
saw
some
of
them
now
in
this
boy
.
``
Aye
,
that
*NL*
we
do
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
looked
hard
too
,
but
she
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
this
minute
,
''
said
Colin
,
``
all
at
once
I
remembered
it
*NL*
myself
--
when
I
looked
at
my
hand
digging
with
the
trowel
--
and
I
had
to
*NL*
stand
up
on
my
feet
to
see
if
it
was
real
.
And
it
is
real
!
I
'm
*NL*
well
--
I
'm
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
that
th
'
art
!
''
said
Dickon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
well
!
I
'm
well
!
''
said
Colin
again
,
and
his
face
went
quite
red
all
*NL*
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
known
it
before
in
a
way
,
he
had
hoped
it
and
felt
it
and
*NL*
thought
about
it
,
but
just
at
that
minute
something
had
rushed
all
*NL*
through
him
--
a
sort
of
rapturous
belief
and
realization
and
it
had
been
*NL*
so
strong
that
he
could
not
help
calling
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
live
forever
and
ever
and
ever
!
''
he
cried
grandly
.
``
I
shall
*NL*
find
out
thousands
and
thousands
of
things
.
I
shall
find
out
about
*NL*
people
and
creatures
and
everything
that
grows
--
like
Dickon
--
and
I
*NL*
shall
never
stop
making
Magic
.
I
'm
well
!
I
'm
well
!
I
feel
--
I
feel
as
*NL*
if
I
want
to
shout
out
something
--
something
thankful
,
joyful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
,
who
had
been
working
near
a
rose-bush
,
glanced
round
*NL*
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
might
sing
th
'
Doxology
,
''
he
suggested
in
his
dryest
grunt
.
He
*NL*
had
no
opinion
of
the
Doxology
and
he
did
not
make
the
suggestion
with
*NL*
any
particular
reverence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Colin
was
of
an
exploring
mind
and
he
knew
nothing
about
the
*NL*
Doxology
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dickon
can
sing
it
for
thee
,
I
'll
warrant
,
''
replied
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
answered
with
his
all-perceiving
animal
charmer
's
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
sing
it
i
'
church
,
''
he
said
.
``
Mother
says
she
believes
th
'
*NL*
skylarks
sings
it
when
they
gets
up
i
'
th
'
mornin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
says
that
,
it
must
be
a
nice
song
,
''
Colin
answered
.
``
I
've
*NL*
never
been
in
a
church
myself
.
I
was
always
too
ill
.
Sing
it
,
Dickon
.
*NL*
I
want
to
hear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
was
quite
simple
and
unaffected
about
it
.
He
understood
what
*NL*
Colin
felt
better
than
Colin
did
himself
.
He
understood
by
a
sort
of
*NL*
instinct
so
natural
that
he
did
not
know
it
was
understanding
.
He
*NL*
pulled
off
his
cap
and
looked
round
still
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'
must
take
off
tha
'
cap
,
''
he
said
to
Colin
,
``
an
'
so
mun
tha
'
,
*NL*
Ben
--
an
'
tha
'
mun
stand
up
,
tha

knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
took
off
his
cap
and
the
sun
shone
on
and
warmed
his
thick
hair
*NL*
as
he
watched
Dickon
intently
.
Ben
Weatherstaff
scrambled
up
from
his
*NL*
knees
and
bared
his
head
too
with
a
sort
of
puzzled
half-resentful
look
*NL*
on
his
old
face
as
if
he
did
n't
know
exactly
why
he
was
doing
this
*NL*
remarkable
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dickon
stood
out
among
the
trees
and
rose-bushes
and
began
to
sing
in
*NL*
quite
a
simple
matter-of-fact
way
and
in
a
nice
strong
boy
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Praise
God
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
,
*NL*
Praise
Him
all
creatures
here
below
,
*NL*
Praise
Him
above
ye
Heavenly
Host
,
*NL*
Praise
Father
,
Son
,
and
Holy
Ghost
.
*NL*
Amen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
,
Ben
Weatherstaff
was
standing
quite
still
with
*NL*
his
jaws
set
obstinately
but
with
a
disturbed
look
in
his
eyes
fixed
on
*NL*
Colin
.
Colin
's
face
was
thoughtful
and
appreciative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
very
nice
song
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
like
it
.
Perhaps
it
means
just
*NL*
what
I
mean
when
I
want
to
shout
out
that
I
am
thankful
to
the
Magic
.
''
*NL*
He
stopped
and
thought
in
a
puzzled
way
.
``
Perhaps
they
are
both
the
*NL*
same
thing
.
How
can
we
know
the
exact
names
of
everything
?
Sing
it
*NL*
again
,
Dickon
.
Let
us
try
,
Mary
.
I
want
to
sing
it
,
too
.
It
's
my
*NL*
song
.
How
does
it
begin
?
`
Praise
God
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
sang
it
again
,
and
Mary
and
Colin
lifted
their
voices
as
*NL*
musically
as
they
could
and
Dickon
's
swelled
quite
loud
and
*NL*
beautiful
--
and
at
the
second
line
Ben
Weatherstaff
raspingly
cleared
*NL*
his
throat
and
at
the
third
line
he
joined
in
with
such
vigor
that
it
*NL*
seemed
almost
savage
and
when
the
``
Amen
''
came
to
an
end
Mary
observed
*NL*
that
the
very
same
thing
had
happened
to
him
which
had
happened
when
he
*NL*
found
out
that
Colin
was
not
a
cripple
--
his
chin
was
twitching
and
he
*NL*
was
staring
and
winking
and
his
leathery
old
cheeks
were
wet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
seed
no
sense
in
th
'
Doxology
afore
,
''
he
said
hoarsely
,
``
but
I
*NL*
may
change
my
mind
i
'
time
.
I
should
say
tha
'd
gone
up
five
pound
this
*NL*
week
Mester
Colin
--
five
on
'em
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
was
looking
across
the
garden
at
something
attracting
his
*NL*
attention
and
his
expression
had
become
a
startled
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
coming
in
here
?
''
he
said
quickly
.
``
Who
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
in
the
ivied
wall
had
been
pushed
gently
open
and
a
woman
had
*NL*
entered
.
She
had
come
in
with
the
last
line
of
their
song
and
she
had
*NL*
stood
still
listening
and
looking
at
them
.
With
the
ivy
behind
her
,
*NL*
the
sunlight
drifting
through
the
trees
and
dappling
her
long
blue
*NL*
cloak
,
and
her
nice
fresh
face
smiling
across
the
greenery
she
was
*NL*
rather
like
a
softly
colored
illustration
in
one
of
Colin
's
books
.
She
*NL*
had
wonderful
affectionate
eyes
which
seemed
to
take
everything
in
--
all
*NL*
of
them
,
even
Ben
Weatherstaff
and
the
``
creatures
''
and
every
flower
*NL*
that
was
in
bloom
.
Unexpectedly
as
she
had
appeared
,
not
one
of
them
*NL*
felt
that
she
was
an
intruder
at
all
.
Dickon
's
eyes
lighted
like
lamps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
mother
--
that
's
who
it
is
!
''
he
cried
and
went
across
the
grass
at
*NL*
a
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
began
to
move
toward
her
,
too
,
and
Mary
went
with
him
.
They
both
*NL*
felt
their
pulses
beat
faster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
mother
!
''
Dickon
said
again
when
they
met
halfway
.
``
I
knowed
tha
'
*NL*
wanted
to
see
her
an
'
I
told
her
where
th
'
door
was
hid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
held
out
his
hand
with
a
sort
of
flushed
royal
shyness
but
his
*NL*
eyes
quite
devoured
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
when
I
was
ill
I
wanted
to
see
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
and
Dickon
and
*NL*
the
secret
garden
.
I
'd
never
wanted
to
see
any
one
or
anything
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
of
his
uplifted
face
brought
about
a
sudden
change
in
her
*NL*
own
.
She
flushed
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
shook
and
a
mist
seemed
*NL*
to
sweep
over
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
dear
lad
!
''
she
broke
out
tremulously
.
``
Eh
!
dear
lad
!
''
as
if
she
*NL*
had
not
known
she
were
going
to
say
it
.
She
did
not
say
,
``
Mester
*NL*
Colin
,
''
but
just
``
dear
lad
''
quite
suddenly
.
She
might
have
said
it
to
*NL*
Dickon
in
the
same
way
if
she
had
seen
something
in
his
face
which
*NL*
touched
her
.
Colin
liked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
surprised
because
I
am
so
well
?
''
he
asked
.
She
put
her
hand
*NL*
on
his
shoulder
and
smiled
the
mist
out
of
her
eyes
.
``
Aye
,
that
I
am
!
''
*NL*
she
said
;
``
but
tha
`
rt
so
like
thy
mother
tha
'
made
my
heart
jump
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
''
said
Colin
a
little
awkwardly
,
``
that
will
make
my
*NL*
father
like
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
for
sure
,
dear
lad
,
''
she
answered
and
she
gave
his
shoulder
a
*NL*
soft
quick
pat
.
``
He
mun
come
home
--
he
mun
come
home

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Susan
Sowerby
,
''
said
Ben
Weatherstaff
,
getting
close
to
her
.
``
Look

th

They

Look

''
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
Sowerby
laughed
a
comfortable
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
goin

to
be
fine
strong

legs
in

she
said
.
``

thank
God
for

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
both
hands
on
Mistress
Mary
's
shoulders
and
looked
her
little
*NL*
face
over
in
a
motherly
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
thee
,
too
!
''
she
said
.
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
mention
that
when
Martha
came
home
on
her
``
day
out
''
and
*NL*
described
the
plain
sallow
child
she
had
said
that
she
had
no
*NL*
confidence
whatever
in
what
Mrs.
Medlock
had
heard
.
``
It
does
n't
stand
*NL*
to
reason
that
a
pretty
woman
could
be
th
'
mother
o
'
such
a
fou
'
little
*NL*
lass
,
''
she
had
added
obstinately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
had
not
had
time
to
pay
much
attention
to
her
changing
face
.
She
*NL*
had
only
known
that
she
looked
``
different
''
and
seemed
to
have
a
great
*NL*
deal
more
hair
and
that
it
was
growing
very
fast
.
But
remembering
her
*NL*
pleasure
in
looking
at
the
Mem
Sahib
in
the
past
she
was
glad
to
hear
*NL*
that
she
might
some
day
look
like
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
Sowerby
went
round
their
garden
with
them
and
was
told
the
whole
*NL*
story
of
it
and
shown
every
bush
and
tree
which
had
come
alive
.
Colin
*NL*
walked
on
one
side
of
her
and
Mary
on
the
other
.
Each
of
them
kept
*NL*
looking
up
at
her
comfortable
rosy
face
,
secretly
curious
about
the
*NL*
delightful
feeling
she
gave
them
--
a
sort
of
warm
,
supported
feeling
.
*NL*
It
seemed
as
if
she
understood
them
as
Dickon
understood
his
*NL*
``
creatures
.
''
She
stooped
over
the
flowers
and
talked
about
them
as
if
*NL*
they
were
children
.
Soot
followed
her
and
once
or
twice
cawed
at
her
*NL*
and
flew
upon
her
shoulder
as
if
it
were
Dickon
's
.
When
they
told
her
*NL*
about
the
robin
and
the
first
flight
of
the
young
ones
she
laughed
a
*NL*
motherly
little
mellow
laugh
in
her
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
learnin
'
'em
to
fly
is
like
learnin
'
children
to
walk
,
but
*NL*
I
'm
feared
I
should
be
all
in
a
worrit
if
mine
had
wings
instead
o
'
*NL*
legs
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
because
she
seemed
such
a
wonderful
woman
in
her
nice
moorland
*NL*
cottage
way
that
at
last
she
was
told
about
the
Magic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
believe
in
Magic
?
''
asked
Colin
after
he
had
explained
about
*NL*
Indian
fakirs
.
``
I
do
hope
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I

''
she
answered
.
``
I
never

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
so
joyful
,
''
said
Colin
,
opening
his
beautiful
strange
eyes
at
*NL*
her
.
``
Suddenly
I
felt
how
different
I
was

how

how

*NL*
*NL*
``
Th

''
and
she
gave
his
shoulders
a
quick
*NL*
soft
pat
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
packed
a
basket
which
held
a
regular
feast
this
morning
,
and
*NL*
when
the
hungry
hour
came
and
Dickon
brought
it
out
from
its
hiding
*NL*
place
,
she
sat
down
with
them
under
their
tree
and
watched
them
devour
*NL*
their
food
,
laughing
and
quite
gloating
over
their
appetites
.
She
was
*NL*
full
of
fun
and
made
them
laugh
at
all
sorts
of
odd
things
.
She
told
*NL*
them
stories
in
broad
Yorkshire
and
taught
them
new
words
.
She
laughed
*NL*
as
if
she
could
not
help
it
when
they
told
her
of
the
increasing
*NL*
difficulty
there
was
in
pretending
that
Colin
was
still
a
fretful
*NL*
invalid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
we
ca
n't
help
laughing
nearly
all
the
time
when
we
are
*NL*
together
,
''
explained
Colin
.
``
And
it
does
n't
sound
ill
at
all
.
We
try
*NL*
to
choke
it
back
but
it
will
burst
out
and
that
sounds
worse
than
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
thing
that
comes
into
my
mind
so
often
,
''
said
Mary
,
``
and
I
*NL*
can
scarcely
ever
hold
in
when
I
think
of
it
suddenly
.
I
keep
thinking
*NL*
suppose
Colin
's
face
should
get
to
look
like
a
full
moon
.
It
is
n't
*NL*
like
one
yet
but
he
gets
a
tiny
bit
fatter
every
day
--
and
suppose
some
*NL*
morning
it
should
look
like
one
--
what
should
we
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
us
all
,
I
can
see

has
a
good
bit
o

*NL*
said
Susan
Sowerby
.
``
But

to

it
up
much
longer

*NL*
Mester
Craven

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
will
?
''
asked
Colin
.
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
Sowerby
chuckled
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
`
ud
nigh
break
thy
heart
if
he
found
out
before
tha
'
told
*NL*
him
in
tha
'
own
way

she
said
.
``
Tha
's

it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
bear
any
one
else
to
tell
him
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
I
think
about
*NL*
different
ways
every
day

I
think
now
I
just
want
to
run
into

room

''
``
That
'd
be
a
fine
start
for
him
,
''
said
Susan
Sowerby
.
``
I
'd
like
*NL*
to
see
his
face
,
lad
.
I
would
that
!
He
mun
come
back
--
that
he
mun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
things
they
talked
of
was
the
visit
they
were
to
make
to
her
*NL*
cottage
.
They
planned
it
all
.
They
were
to
drive
over
the
moor
and
*NL*
lunch
out
of
doors
among
the
heather
.
They
would
see
all
the
twelve
*NL*
children
and
Dickon
's
garden
and
would
not
come
back
until
they
were
*NL*
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
Sowerby
got
up
at
last
to
return
to
the
house
and
Mrs.
Medlock
.
*NL*
It
was
time
for
Colin
to
be
wheeled
back
also
.
But
before
he
got
into
*NL*
his
chair
he
stood
quite
close
to
Susan
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
her
with
*NL*
a
kind
of
bewildered
adoration
and
he
suddenly
caught
hold
of
the
fold
*NL*
of
her
blue
cloak
and
held
it
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
just
what
I
--
what
I
wanted
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
wish
you
were
my
*NL*
mother
--
as
well
as
Dickon
's
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
Susan
Sowerby
bent
down
and
drew
him
with
her
warm
arms
*NL*
close
against
the
bosom
under
the
blue
cloak
--
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
Dickon
's
brother
.
The
quick
mist
swept
over
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
dear
lad
!
''
she
said
.
``
Thy

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
IN
THE
GARDEN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
each
century
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
wonderful
things
have
*NL*
been
discovered
.
In
the
last
century
more
amazing
things
were
found
*NL*
out
than
in
any
century
before
.
In
this
new
century
hundreds
of
things
*NL*
still
more
astounding
will
be
brought
to
light
.
At
first
people
refuse
*NL*
to
believe
that
a
strange
new
thing
can
be
done
,
then
they
begin
to
*NL*
hope
it
can
be
done
,
then
they
see
it
can
be
done
--
then
it
is
done
and
*NL*
all
the
world
wonders
why
it
was
not
done
centuries
ago
.
One
of
the
*NL*
new
things
people
began
to
find
out
in
the
last
century
was
that
*NL*
thoughts
--
just
mere
thoughts
--
are
as
powerful
as
electric
batteries
--
as
*NL*
good
for
one
as
sunlight
is
,
or
as
bad
for
one
as
poison
.
To
let
a
sad
*NL*
thought
or
a
bad
one
get
into
your
mind
is
as
dangerous
as
letting
a
*NL*
scarlet
fever
germ
get
into
your
body
.
If
you
let
it
stay
there
after
*NL*
it
has
got
in
you
may
never
get
over
it
as
long
as
you
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
long
as
Mistress
Mary
's
mind
was
full
of
disagreeable
thoughts
about
*NL*
her
dislikes
and
sour
opinions
of
people
and
her
determination
not
to
*NL*
be
pleased
by
or
interested
in
anything
,
she
was
a
yellow-faced
,
*NL*
sickly
,
bored
and
wretched
child
.
Circumstances
,
however
,
were
very
*NL*
kind
to
her
,
though
she
was
not
at
all
aware
of
it
.
They
began
to
push
*NL*
her
about
for
her
own
good
.
When
her
mind
gradually
filled
itself
with
*NL*
robins
,
and
moorland
cottages
crowded
with
children
,
with
queer
crabbed
*NL*
old
gardeners
and
common
little
Yorkshire
housemaids
,
with
springtime
*NL*
and
with
secret
gardens
coming
alive
day
by
day
,
and
also
with
a
moor
*NL*
boy
and
his
``
creatures
,
''
there
was
no
room
left
for
the
disagreeable
*NL*
thoughts
which
affected
her
liver
and
her
digestion
and
made
her
yellow
*NL*
and
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
long
as
Colin
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
and
thought
only
of
his
*NL*
fears
and
weakness
and
his
detestation
of
people
who
looked
at
him
and
*NL*
reflected
hourly
on
humps
and
early
death
,
he
was
a
hysterical
*NL*
half-crazy
little
hypochondriac
who
knew
nothing
of
the
sunshine
and
*NL*
the
spring
and
also
did
not
know
that
he
could
get
well
and
could
stand
*NL*
upon
his
feet
if
he
tried
to
do
it
.
When
new
beautiful
thoughts
began
*NL*
to
push
out
the
old
hideous
ones
,
life
began
to
come
back
to
him
,
his
*NL*
blood
ran
healthily
through
his
veins
and
strength
poured
into
him
like
*NL*
a
flood
.
His
scientific
experiment
was
quite
practical
and
simple
and
*NL*
there
was
nothing
weird
about
it
at
all
.
Much
more
surprising
things
*NL*
can
happen
to
any
one
who
,
when
a
disagreeable
or
discouraged
thought
*NL*
comes
into
his
mind
,
just
has
the
sense
to
remember
in
time
and
push
it
*NL*
out
by
putting
in
an
agreeable
determinedly
courageous
one
.
Two
things
*NL*
can
not
be
in
one
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
,
you
tend
a
rose
,
my
lad
,
*NL*
A
thistle
can
not
grow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
secret
garden
was
coming
alive
and
two
children
were
coming
*NL*
alive
with
it
,
there
was
a
man
wandering
about
certain
far-away
*NL*
beautiful
places
in
the
Norwegian
fiords
and
the
valleys
and
mountains
*NL*
of
Switzerland
and
he
was
a
man
who
for
ten
years
had
kept
his
mind
*NL*
filled
with
dark
and
heart-broken
thinking
.
He
had
not
been
*NL*
courageous
;
he
had
never
tried
to
put
any
other
thoughts
in
the
place
*NL*
of
the
dark
ones
.
He
had
wandered
by
blue
lakes
and
thought
them
;
he
*NL*
had
lain
on
mountain-sides
with
sheets
of
deep
blue
gentians
blooming
*NL*
all
about
him
and
flower
breaths
filling
all
the
air
and
he
had
thought
*NL*
them
.
A
terrible
sorrow
had
fallen
upon
him
when
he
had
been
happy
and
*NL*
he
had
let
his
soul
fill
itself
with
blackness
and
had
refused
*NL*
obstinately
to
allow
any
rift
of
light
to
pierce
through
.
He
had
*NL*
forgotten
and
deserted
his
home
and
his
duties
.
When
he
traveled
*NL*
about
,
darkness
so
brooded
over
him
that
the
sight
of
him
was
a
wrong
*NL*
done
to
other
people
because
it
was
as
if
he
poisoned
the
air
about
him
*NL*
with
gloom
.
Most
strangers
thought
he
must
be
either
half
mad
or
a
man
*NL*
with
some
hidden
crime
on
his
soul
.
He
,
was
a
tall
man
with
a
drawn
*NL*
face
and
crooked
shoulders
and
the
name
he
always
entered
on
hotel
*NL*
registers
was
,
``
Archibald
Craven
,
Misselthwaite
Manor
,
Yorkshire
,
*NL*
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
traveled
far
and
wide
since
the
day
he
saw
Mistress
Mary
in
his
*NL*
study
and
told
her
she
might
have
her
``
bit
of
earth
.
''
He
had
been
in
*NL*
the
most
beautiful
places
in
Europe
,
though
he
had
remained
nowhere
*NL*
more
than
a
few
days
.
He
had
chosen
the
quietest
and
remotest
spots
.
*NL*
He
had
been
on
the
tops
of
mountains
whose
heads
were
in
the
clouds
and
*NL*
had
looked
down
on
other
mountains
when
the
sun
rose
and
touched
them
*NL*
with
such
light
as
made
it
seem
as
if
the
world
were
just
being
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
light
had
never
seemed
to
touch
himself
until
one
day
when
he
*NL*
realized
that
for
the
first
time
in
ten
years
a
strange
thing
had
*NL*
happened
.
He
was
in
a
wonderful
valley
in
the
Austrian
Tyrol
and
he
*NL*
had
been
walking
alone
through
such
beauty
as
might
have
lifted
,
any
*NL*
man
's
soul
out
of
shadow
.
He
had
walked
a
long
way
and
it
had
not
*NL*
lifted
his
.
But
at
last
he
had
felt
tired
and
had
thrown
himself
down
*NL*
to
rest
on
a
carpet
of
moss
by
a
stream
.
It
was
a
clear
little
stream
*NL*
which
ran
quite
merrily
along
on
its
narrow
way
through
the
luscious
*NL*
damp
greenness
.
Sometimes
it
made
a
sound
rather
like
very
low
*NL*
laughter
as
it
bubbled
over
and
round
stones
.
He
saw
birds
come
and
*NL*
dip
their
heads
to
drink
in
it
and
then
flick
their
wings
and
fly
away
.
*NL*
It
seemed
like
a
thing
alive
and
yet
its
tiny
voice
made
the
stillness
*NL*
seem
deeper
.
The
valley
was
very
,
very
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
sat
gazing
into
the
clear
running
of
the
water
,
Archibald
Craven
*NL*
gradually
felt
his
mind
and
body
both
grow
quiet
,
as
quiet
as
the
*NL*
valley
itself
.
He
wondered
if
he
were
going
to
sleep
,
but
he
was
not
.
*NL*
He
sat
and
gazed
at
the
sunlit
water
and
his
eyes
began
to
see
things
*NL*
growing
at
its
edge
.
There
was
one
lovely
mass
of
blue
forget-me-nots
*NL*
growing
so
close
to
the
stream
that
its
leaves
were
wet
and
at
these
he
*NL*
found
himself
looking
as
he
remembered
he
had
looked
at
such
things
*NL*
years
ago
.
He
was
actually
thinking
tenderly
how
lovely
it
was
and
*NL*
what
wonders
of
blue
its
hundreds
of
little
blossoms
were
.
He
did
not
*NL*
know
that
just
that
simple
thought
was
slowly
filling
his
mind
--
filling
*NL*
and
filling
it
until
other
things
were
softly
pushed
aside
.
It
was
as
*NL*
if
a
sweet
clear
spring
had
begun
to
rise
in
a
stagnant
pool
and
had
*NL*
risen
and
risen
until
at
last
it
swept
the
dark
water
away
.
But
of
*NL*
course
he
did
not
think
of
this
himself
.
He
only
knew
that
the
valley
*NL*
seemed
to
grow
quieter
and
quieter
as
he
sat
and
stared
at
the
bright
*NL*
delicate
blueness
.
He
did
not
know
how
long
he
sat
there
or
what
was
*NL*
happening
to
him
,
but
at
last
he
moved
as
if
he
were
awakening
and
he
*NL*
got
up
slowly
and
stood
on
the
moss
carpet
,
drawing
a
long
,
deep
,
soft
*NL*
breath
and
wondering
at
himself
.
Something
seemed
to
have
been
unbound
*NL*
and
released
in
him
,
very
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
said
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
and
he
passed
his
hand
over
*NL*
his
forehead
.
``
I
almost
feel
as
if
--
I
were
alive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
know
enough
about
the
wonderfulness
of
undiscovered
things
to
*NL*
be
able
to
explain
how
this
had
happened
to
him
.
Neither
does
any
one
*NL*
else
yet
.
He
did
not
understand
at
all
himself
--
but
he
remembered
this
*NL*
strange
hour
months
afterward
when
he
was
at
Misselthwaite
again
and
he
*NL*
found
out
quite
by
accident
that
on
this
very
day
Colin
had
cried
out
*NL*
as
he
went
into
the
secret
garden
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
live
forever
and
ever
and
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
singular
calmness
remained
with
him
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
he
*NL*
slept
a
new
reposeful
sleep
;
but
it
was
not
with
him
very
long
.
He
did
*NL*
not
know
that
it
could
be
kept
.
By
the
next
night
he
had
opened
the
*NL*
doors
wide
to
his
dark
thoughts
and
they
had
come
trooping
and
rushing
*NL*
back
.
He
left
the
valley
and
went
on
his
wandering
way
again
.
But
,
*NL*
strange
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
there
were
minutes
--
sometimes
*NL*
half-hours
--
when
,
without
his
knowing
why
,
the
black
burden
seemed
to
*NL*
lift
itself
again
and
he
knew
he
was
a
living
man
and
not
a
dead
one
.
*NL*
Slowly
--
slowly
--
for
no
reason
that
he
knew
of
--
he
was
``
coming
alive
''
*NL*
with
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
golden
summer
changed
into
the
deep
golden
autumn
he
went
to
the
*NL*
Lake
of
Como
.
There
he
found
the
loveliness
of
a
dream
.
He
spent
his
*NL*
days
upon
the
crystal
blueness
of
the
lake
or
he
walked
back
into
the
*NL*
soft
thick
verdure
of
the
hills
and
tramped
until
he
was
tired
so
that
*NL*
he
might
sleep
.
But
by
this
time
he
had
begun
to
sleep
better
,
he
*NL*
knew
,
and
his
dreams
had
ceased
to
be
a
terror
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
he
thought
,
``
my
body
is
growing
stronger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
growing
stronger
but
--
because
of
the
rare
peaceful
hours
when
*NL*
his
thoughts
were
changed
--
his
soul
was
slowly
growing
stronger
,
too
.
*NL*
He
began
to
think
of
Misselthwaite
and
wonder
if
he
should
not
go
home
.
*NL*
Now
and
then
he
wondered
vaguely
about
his
boy
and
asked
himself
what
*NL*
he
should
feel
when
he
went
and
stood
by
the
carved
four-posted
bed
*NL*
again
and
looked
down
at
the
sharply
chiseled
ivory-white
face
while
it
*NL*
slept
and
,
the
black
lashes
rimmed
so
startlingly
the
close-shut
eyes
.
*NL*
He
shrank
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
marvel
of
a
day
he
had
walked
so
far
that
when
he
returned
the
moon
*NL*
was
high
and
full
and
all
the
world
was
purple
shadow
and
silver
.
The
*NL*
stillness
of
lake
and
shore
and
wood
was
so
wonderful
that
he
did
not
*NL*
go
into
the
villa
he
lived
in
.
He
walked
down
to
a
little
bowered
*NL*
terrace
at
the
water
's
edge
and
sat
upon
a
seat
and
breathed
in
all
the
*NL*
heavenly
scents
of
the
night
.
He
felt
the
strange
calmness
stealing
*NL*
over
him
and
it
grew
deeper
and
deeper
until
he
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
when
he
fell
asleep
and
when
he
began
to
dream
;
his
*NL*
dream
was
so
real
that
he
did
not
feel
as
if
he
were
dreaming
.
He
*NL*
remembered
afterward
how
intensely
wide
awake
and
alert
he
had
thought
*NL*
he
was
.
He
thought
that
as
he
sat
and
breathed
in
the
scent
of
the
*NL*
late
roses
and
listened
to
the
lapping
of
the
water
at
his
feet
he
*NL*
heard
a
voice
calling
.
It
was
sweet
and
clear
and
happy
and
far
away
.
*NL*
It
seemed
very
far
,
but
he
heard
it
as
distinctly
as
if
it
had
been
at
*NL*
his
very
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Archie
!
Archie
!
Archie
!
''
it
said
,
and
then
again
,
sweeter
and
clearer
*NL*
than
before
,
``
Archie
!
Archie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
he
sprang
to
his
feet
not
even
startled
.
It
was
such
a
real
*NL*
voice
and
it
seemed
so
natural
that
he
should
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lilias
!
Lilias
!
''
he
answered
.
``
Lilias
!
where
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
garden
,
''
it
came
back
like
a
sound
from
a
golden
flute
.
``
In
*NL*
the
garden
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
dream
ended
.
But
he
did
not
awaken
.
He
slept
soundly
and
*NL*
sweetly
all
through
the
lovely
night
.
When
he
did
awake
at
last
it
was
*NL*
brilliant
morning
and
a
servant
was
standing
staring
at
him
.
He
was
an
*NL*
Italian
servant
and
was
accustomed
,
as
all
the
servants
of
the
villa
*NL*
were
,
to
accepting
without
question
any
strange
thing
his
foreign
*NL*
master
might
do
.
No
one
ever
knew
when
he
would
go
out
or
come
in
or
*NL*
where
he
would
choose
to
sleep
or
if
he
would
roam
about
the
garden
or
*NL*
lie
in
the
boat
on
the
lake
all
night
.
The
man
held
a
salver
with
some
*NL*
letters
on
it
and
he
waited
quietly
until
Mr.
Craven
took
them
.
When
*NL*
he
had
gone
away
Mr.
Craven
sat
a
few
moments
holding
them
in
his
hand
*NL*
and
looking
at
the
lake
.
His
strange
calm
was
still
upon
him
and
*NL*
something
more
--
a
lightness
as
if
the
cruel
thing
which
had
been
done
*NL*
had
not
happened
as
he
thought
--
as
if
something
had
changed
.
He
was
*NL*
remembering
the
dream
--
the
real
--
real
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
garden
!
''
he
said
,
wondering
at
himself
.
``
In
the
garden
!
But
*NL*
the
door
is
locked
and
the
key
is
buried
deep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
glanced
at
the
letters
a
few
minutes
later
he
saw
that
the
one
*NL*
lying
at
the
top
of
the
rest
was
an
English
letter
and
came
from
*NL*
Yorkshire
.
It
was
directed
in
a
plain
woman
's
hand
but
it
was
not
a
*NL*
hand
he
knew
.
He
opened
it
,
scarcely
thinking
of
the
writer
,
but
the
*NL*
first
words
attracted
his
attention
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Sir
:
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
Susan
Sowerby
that
made
bold
to
speak
to
you
once
on
the
moor
.
It
*NL*
was
about
Miss
Mary
I
spoke
.
I
will
make
bold
to
speak
again
.
Please
,
*NL*
sir
,
I
would
come
home
if
I
was
you
.
I
think
you
would
be
glad
to
come
*NL*
and
--
if
you
will
excuse
me
,
sir
--
I
think
your
lady
would
ask
you
to
*NL*
come
if
she
was
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
obedient
servant
,
*NL*
Susan
Sowerby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Craven
read
the
letter
twice
before
he
put
it
back
in
its
envelope
.
*NL*
He
kept
thinking
about
the
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
back
to
Misselthwaite
,
''
he
said
.
``
Yes
,
I
'll
go
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
through
the
garden
to
the
villa
and
ordered
Pitcher
to
*NL*
prepare
for
his
return
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
days
he
was
in
Yorkshire
again
,
and
on
his
long
railroad
*NL*
journey
he
found
himself
thinking
of
his
boy
as
he
had
never
thought
in
*NL*
all
the
ten
years
past
.
During
those
years
he
had
only
wished
to
*NL*
forget
him
.
Now
,
though
he
did
not
intend
to
think
about
him
,
memories
*NL*
of
him
constantly
drifted
into
his
mind
.
He
remembered
the
black
days
*NL*
when
he
had
raved
like
a
madman
because
the
child
was
alive
and
the
*NL*
mother
was
dead
.
He
had
refused
to
see
it
,
and
when
he
had
gone
to
*NL*
look
at
it
at
last
it
had
been
,
such
a
weak
wretched
thing
that
*NL*
everyone
had
been
sure
it
would
die
in
a
few
days
.
But
to
the
surprise
*NL*
of
those
who
took
care
of
it
the
days
passed
and
it
lived
and
then
*NL*
everyone
believed
it
would
be
a
deformed
and
crippled
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
meant
to
be
a
bad
father
,
but
he
had
not
felt
like
a
father
*NL*
at
all
.
He
had
supplied
doctors
and
nurses
and
luxuries
,
but
he
had
*NL*
shrunk
from
the
mere
thought
of
the
boy
and
had
buried
himself
in
his
*NL*
own
misery
.
The
first
time
after
a
year
's
absence
he
returned
to
*NL*
Misselthwaite
and
the
small
miserable
looking
thing
languidly
and
*NL*
indifferently
lifted
to
his
face
the
great
gray
eyes
with
black
lashes
*NL*
round
them
,
so
like
and
yet
so
horribly
unlike
the
happy
eyes
he
had
*NL*
adored
,
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
them
and
turned
away
pale
as
*NL*
death
.
After
that
he
scarcely
ever
saw
him
except
when
he
was
asleep
,
*NL*
and
all
he
knew
of
him
was
that
he
was
a
confirmed
invalid
,
with
a
*NL*
vicious
,
hysterical
,
half-insane
temper
.
He
could
only
be
kept
from
*NL*
furies
dangerous
to
himself
by
being
given
his
own
way
in
every
detail
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
not
an
uplifting
thing
to
recall
,
but
as
the
train
whirled
*NL*
him
through
mountain
passes
and
golden
plains
the
man
who
was
``
coming
*NL*
alive
''
began
to
think
in
a
new
way
and
he
thought
long
and
steadily
and
*NL*
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
have
been
all
wrong
for
ten
years
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
``
Ten
years
is
a
long
time
.
It
may
be
too
late
to
do
anything
--
quite
*NL*
too
late
.
What
have
I
been
thinking
of
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
this
was
the
wrong
Magic
--
to
begin
by
saying
``
too
late
.
''
Even
*NL*
Colin
could
have
told
him
that
.
But
he
knew
nothing
of
Magic
--
either
*NL*
black
or
white
.
This
he
had
yet
to
learn
.
He
wondered
if
Susan
*NL*
Sowerby
had
taken
courage
and
written
to
him
only
because
the
motherly
*NL*
creature
had
realized
that
the
boy
was
much
worse
--
was
fatally
ill
.
If
*NL*
he
had
not
been
under
the
spell
of
the
curious
calmness
which
had
taken
*NL*
possession
of
him
he
would
have
been
more
wretched
than
ever
.
But
the
*NL*
calm
had
brought
a
sort
of
courage
and
hope
with
it
.
Instead
of
giving
*NL*
way
to
thoughts
of
the
worst
he
actually
found
he
was
trying
to
believe
*NL*
in
better
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
it
be
possible
that
she
sees
that
I
may
be
able
to
do
him
good
*NL*
and
control
him
?
''
he
thought
.
``
I
will
go
and
see
her
on
my
way
to
*NL*
Misselthwaite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
on
his
way
across
the
moor
he
stopped
the
carriage
at
the
*NL*
cottage
,
seven
or
eight
children
who
were
playing
about
gathered
in
a
*NL*
group
and
bobbing
seven
or
eight
friendly
and
polite
curtsies
told
him
*NL*
that
their
mother
had
gone
to
the
other
side
of
the
moor
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
to
help
a
woman
who
had
a
new
baby
.
``
Our
Dickon
,
''
they
*NL*
volunteered
,
was
over
at
the
Manor
working
in
one
of
the
gardens
where
*NL*
he
went
several
days
each
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Craven
looked
over
the
collection
of
sturdy
little
bodies
and
round
*NL*
red-cheeked
faces
,
each
one
grinning
in
its
own
particular
way
,
and
he
*NL*
awoke
to
the
fact
that
they
were
a
healthy
likable
lot
.
He
smiled
at
*NL*
their
friendly
grins
and
took
a
golden
sovereign
from
his
pocket
and
*NL*
gave
it
to
``
our
`
Lizabeth
Ellen
''
who
was
the
oldest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
divide
that
into
eight
parts
there
will
be
half
a
crown
for
*NL*
each
of
,
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
amid
grins
and
chuckles
and
bobbing
of
curtsies
he
drove
away
,
*NL*
leaving
ecstasy
and
nudging
elbows
and
little
jumps
of
joy
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drive
across
the
wonderfulness
of
the
moor
was
a
soothing
thing
.
*NL*
Why
did
it
seem
to
give
him
a
sense
of
homecoming
which
he
had
been
*NL*
sure
he
could
never
feel
again
--
that
sense
of
the
beauty
of
land
and
*NL*
sky
and
purple
bloom
of
distance
and
a
warming
of
the
heart
at
drawing
,
*NL*
nearer
to
the
great
old
house
which
had
held
those
of
his
blood
for
six
*NL*
hundred
years
?
How
he
had
driven
away
from
it
the
last
time
,
shuddering
*NL*
to
think
of
its
closed
rooms
and
the
boy
lying
in
the
four-posted
bed
*NL*
with
the
brocaded
hangings
.
Was
it
possible
that
perhaps
he
might
find
*NL*
him
changed
a
little
for
the
better
and
that
he
might
overcome
his
*NL*
shrinking
from
him
?
How
real
that
dream
had
been
--
how
wonderful
and
*NL*
clear
the
voice
which
called
back
to
him
,
``
In
the
garden
--
In
the
*NL*
garden
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
to
find
the
key
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
will
try
to
open
the
door
.
*NL*
I
must
--
though
I
do
n't
know
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
arrived
at
the
Manor
the
servants
who
received
him
with
the
*NL*
usual
ceremony
noticed
that
he
looked
better
and
that
he
did
not
go
to
*NL*
the
remote
rooms
where
he
usually
lived
attended
by
Pitcher
.
He
went
*NL*
into
the
library
and
sent
for
Mrs.
Medlock
.
She
came
to
him
somewhat
*NL*
excited
and
curious
and
flustered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
Master
Colin
,
Medlock
?
''
he
inquired
.
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
Mrs.
Medlock
*NL*
answered
,
``
he
's
--
he
's
different
,
in
a
manner
of
speaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worse
?
''
he
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Medlock
really
was
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
,
sir
,
''
she
tried
to
explain
,
``
neither
Dr.
Craven
,
nor
*NL*
the
nurse
,
nor
me
can
exactly
make
him
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
the
truth
,
sir
,
Master
Colin
might
be
better
and
he
might
be
*NL*
changing
for
the
worse
.
His
appetite
,
sir
,
is
past
understanding
--
and
*NL*
his
ways
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
become
more
--
more
peculiar
?
''
her
master
,
asked
,
knitting
his
*NL*
brows
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
sir
.
He
's
growing
very
peculiar
--
when
you
compare
him
with
*NL*
what
he
used
to
be
.
He
used
to
eat
nothing
and
then
suddenly
he
began
*NL*
to
eat
something
enormous
--
and
then
he
stopped
again
all
at
once
and
*NL*
the
meals
were
sent
back
just
as
they
used
to
be
.
You
never
knew
,
sir
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
that
out
of
doors
he
never
would
let
himself
be
taken
.
The
*NL*
things
we
've
gone
through
to
get
him
to
go
out
in
his
chair
would
leave
*NL*
a
body
trembling
like
a
leaf
.
He
'd
throw
himself
into
such
a
state
*NL*
that
Dr.
Craven
said
he
could
n't
be
responsible
for
forcing
him
.
Well
,
*NL*
sir
,
just
without
warning
--
not
long
after
one
of
his
worst
tantrums
he
*NL*
suddenly
insisted
on
being
taken
out
every
day
by
Miss
Mary
and
Susan
*NL*
Sowerby
's
boy
Dickon
that
could
push
his
chair
.
He
took
a
fancy
to
*NL*
both
Miss
Mary
and
Dickon
,
and
Dickon
brought
his
tame
animals
,
and
,
if
*NL*
you
'll
credit
it
,
sir
,
out
of
doors
he
will
stay
from
morning
until
*NL*
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
he
look
?
''
was
the
next
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
took
his
food
natural
,
sir
,
you
'd
think
he
was
putting
on
*NL*
flesh
--
but
we
're
afraid
it
may
be
a
sort
of
bloat
.
He
laughs
sometimes
*NL*
in
a
queer
way
when
he
's
alone
with
Miss
Mary
.
He
never
used
to
laugh
*NL*
at
all
.
Dr.
Craven
is
coming
to
see
you
at
once
,
if
you
'll
allow
him
.
*NL*
He
never
was
as
puzzled
in
his
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Master
Colin
now
?
''
Mr.
Craven
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
garden
,
sir
.
He
's
always
in
the
garden
--
though
not
a
human
*NL*
creature
is
allowed
to
go
near
for
fear
they
'll
look
at
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Craven
scarcely
heard
her
last
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
garden
,
''
he
said
,
and
after
he
had
sent
Mrs.
Medlock
away
he
*NL*
stood
and
repeated
it
again
and
again
.
``
In
the
garden
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
make
an
effort
to
bring
himself
back
to
the
place
he
was
*NL*
standing
in
and
when
he
felt
he
was
on
earth
again
he
turned
and
went
*NL*
out
of
the
room
.
He
took
his
way
,
as
Mary
had
done
,
through
the
door
*NL*
in
the
shrubbery
and
among
the
laurels
and
the
fountain
beds
.
The
*NL*
fountain
was
playing
now
and
was
encircled
by
beds
of
brilliant
autumn
*NL*
flowers
.
He
crossed
the
lawn
and
turned
into
the
Long
Walk
by
the
*NL*
ivied
walls
.
He
did
not
walk
quickly
,
but
slowly
,
and
his
eyes
were
on
*NL*
the
path
.
He
felt
as
if
he
were
being
drawn
back
to
the
place
he
had
*NL*
so
long
forsaken
,
and
he
did
not
know
why
.
As
he
drew
near
to
it
his
*NL*
step
became
still
more
slow
.
He
knew
where
the
door
was
even
though
*NL*
the
ivy
hung
thick
over
it
--
but
he
did
not
know
exactly
where
it
*NL*
lay
--
that
buried
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
stopped
and
stood
still
,
looking
about
him
,
and
almost
the
moment
*NL*
after
he
had
paused
he
started
and
listened
--
asking
himself
if
he
were
*NL*
walking
in
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ivy
hung
thick
over
the
door
,
the
key
was
buried
under
the
shrubs
,
*NL*
no
human
being
had
passed
that
portal
for
ten
lonely
years
--
and
yet
*NL*
inside
the
garden
there
were
sounds
.
They
were
the
sounds
of
running
*NL*
scuffling
feet
seeming
to
chase
round
and
round
under
the
trees
,
they
*NL*
were
strange
sounds
of
lowered
suppressed
voices
--
exclamations
and
*NL*
smothered
joyous
cries
.
It
seemed
actually
like
the
laughter
of
young
*NL*
things
,
the
uncontrollable
laughter
of
children
who
were
trying
not
to
*NL*
be
heard
but
who
in
a
moment
or
so
--
as
their
excitement
mounted
--
would
*NL*
burst
forth
.
What
in
heaven
's
name
was
he
dreaming
of
--
what
in
*NL*
heaven
's
name
did
he
hear
?
Was
he
losing
his
reason
and
thinking
he
*NL*
heard
things
which
were
not
for
human
ears
?
Was
it
that
the
far
clear
*NL*
voice
had
meant
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
moment
came
,
the
uncontrollable
moment
when
the
sounds
*NL*
forgot
to
hush
themselves
.
The
feet
ran
faster
and
faster
--
they
were
*NL*
nearing
the
garden
door
--
there
was
quick
strong
young
breathing
and
a
*NL*
wild
outbreak
of
laughing
shows
which
could
not
be
contained
--
and
the
*NL*
door
in
the
wall
was
flung
wide
open
,
the
sheet
of
ivy
swinging
back
,
*NL*
and
a
boy
burst
through
it
at
full
speed
and
,
without
seeing
the
*NL*
outsider
,
dashed
almost
into
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Craven
had
extended
them
just
in
time
to
save
him
from
falling
as
a
*NL*
result
of
his
unseeing
dash
against
him
,
and
when
he
held
him
away
to
*NL*
look
at
him
in
amazement
at
his
being
there
he
truly
gasped
for
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
tall
boy
and
a
handsome
one
.
He
was
glowing
with
life
and
his
*NL*
running
had
sent
splendid
color
leaping
to
his
face
.
He
threw
the
*NL*
thick
hair
back
from
his
forehead
and
lifted
a
pair
of
strange
gray
*NL*
eyes
--
eyes
full
of
boyish
laughter
and
rimmed
with
black
lashes
like
a
*NL*
fringe
.
It
was
the
eyes
which
made
Mr.
Craven
gasp
for
breath
.
*NL*
``
Who
--
What
?
Who
!
''
he
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
what
Colin
had
expected
--
this
was
not
what
he
had
planned
.
*NL*
He
had
never
thought
of
such
a
meeting
.
And
yet
to
come
dashing
*NL*
out
--
winning
a
race
--
perhaps
it
was
even
better
.
He
drew
himself
up
to
*NL*
his
very
tallest
.
Mary
,
who
had
been
running
with
him
and
had
dashed
*NL*
through
the
door
too
,
believed
that
he
managed
to
make
himself
look
*NL*
taller
than
he
had
ever
looked
before
--
inches
taller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
'm
Colin
.
You
ca
n't
believe
it
.
I
scarcely
can
*NL*
myself
.
I
'm
Colin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Like
Mrs.
Medlock
,
he
did
not
understand
what
his
father
meant
when
he
*NL*
said
hurriedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
garden
!
In
the
garden
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
hurried
on
Colin
.
``
It
was
the
garden
that
did
it
--
and
Mary
and
*NL*
Dickon
and
the
creatures
--
and
the
Magic
.
No
one
knows
.
We
kept
it
to
*NL*
tell
you
when
you
came
.
I
'm
well
,
I
can
beat
Mary
in
a
race
.
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
be
an
athlete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
all
so
like
a
healthy
boy
--
his
face
flushed
,
his
words
*NL*
tumbling
over
each
other
in
his
eagerness
--
that
Mr.
Craven
's
soul
shook
*NL*
with
unbelieving
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colin
put
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
on
his
father
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
glad
,
Father
?
''
he
ended
.
``
Are
n't
you
glad
?
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
live
forever
and
ever
and
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Craven
put
his
hands
on
both
the
boy
's
shoulders
and
held
him
*NL*
still
.
He
knew
he
dared
not
even
try
to
speak
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
me
into
the
garden
,
my
boy
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
And
tell
me
all
*NL*
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
they
led
him
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
was
a
wilderness
of
autumn
gold
and
purple
and
violet
blue
*NL*
and
flaming
scarlet
and
on
every
side
were
sheaves
of
late
lilies
*NL*
standing
together
--
lilies
which
were
white
or
white
and
ruby
.
He
*NL*
remembered
well
when
the
first
of
them
had
been
planted
that
just
at
*NL*
this
season
of
the
year
their
late
glories
should
reveal
themselves
.
*NL*
Late
roses
climbed
and
hung
and
clustered
and
the
sunshine
deepening
*NL*
the
hue
of
the
yellowing
trees
made
one
feel
that
one
,
stood
in
an
*NL*
embowered
temple
of
gold
.
The
newcomer
stood
silent
just
as
the
*NL*
children
had
done
when
they
came
into
its
grayness
.
He
looked
round
*NL*
and
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
would
be
dead
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
thought
so
at
first
,
''
said
Colin
.
``
But
it
came
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
sat
down
under
their
tree
--
all
but
Colin
,
who
wanted
to
stand
*NL*
while
he
told
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
strangest
thing
he
had
ever
heard
,
Archibald
Craven
thought
,
*NL*
as
it
was
poured
forth
in
headlong
boy
fashion
.
Mystery
and
Magic
and
*NL*
wild
creatures
,
the
weird
midnight
meeting
--
the
coming
of
the
*NL*
spring
--
the
passion
of
insulted
pride
which
had
dragged
the
young
Rajah
*NL*
to
his
feet
to
defy
old
Ben
Weatherstaff
to
his
face
.
The
odd
*NL*
companionship
,
the
play
acting
,
the
great
secret
so
carefully
kept
.
*NL*
The
listener
laughed
until
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
sometimes
tears
*NL*
came
into
his
eyes
when
he
was
not
laughing
.
The
Athlete
,
the
*NL*
Lecturer
,
the
Scientific
Discoverer
was
a
laughable
,
lovable
,
healthy
*NL*
young
human
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
he
said
at
the
end
of
the
story
,
``
it
need
not
be
a
secret
any
*NL*
more
.
I
dare
say
it
will
frighten
them
nearly
into
fits
when
they
see
*NL*
me
--
but
I
am
never
going
to
get
into
the
chair
again
.
I
shall
walk
*NL*
back
with
you
,
Father
--
to
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Weatherstaff
's
duties
rarely
took
him
away
from
the
gardens
,
but
on
*NL*
this
occasion
he
made
an
excuse
to
carry
some
vegetables
to
the
kitchen
*NL*
and
being
invited
into
the
servants
'
hall
by
Mrs.
Medlock
to
drink
a
*NL*
glass
of
beer
he
was
on
the
spot
--
as
he
had
hoped
to
be
--
when
the
most
*NL*
dramatic
event
Misselthwaite
Manor
had
seen
during
the
present
*NL*
generation
actually
took
place
.
One
of
the
windows
looking
upon
the
*NL*
courtyard
gave
also
a
glimpse
of
the
lawn
.
Mrs.
Medlock
,
knowing
Ben
*NL*
had
come
from
the
gardens
,
hoped
that
he
might
have
caught
sight
of
his
*NL*
master
and
even
by
chance
of
his
meeting
with
Master
Colin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
either
of
them
,
Weatherstaff
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
took
his
beer-mug
from
his
mouth
and
wiped
his
lips
with
the
back
*NL*
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
that
I
did
,
''
he
answered
with
a
shrewdly
significant
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
of
them
?
''
suggested
Mrs.
Medlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
of
'em
,
''
returned
Ben
Weatherstaff
.
``
Thank
ye
kindly
,
ma'am
,
I
*NL*
could
sup
up
another
mug
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Together
?
''
said
Mrs.
Medlock
,
hastily
overfilling
his
beer-mug
in
her
*NL*
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Together
,
ma'am
,
''
and
Ben
gulped
down
half
of
his
new
mug
at
one
gulp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
was
Master
Colin
?
How
did
he
look
?
What
did
they
say
to
each
*NL*
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
didna
'
hear
that
,
''
said
Ben
,
``
along
o
'
only
bein
'
on
th
'
stepladder
*NL*
lookin
,
over
th
'
wall
.
But
I
'll
tell
thee
this
.
There
's
been
things
*NL*
goin
'
on
outside
as
you
house
people
knows
nowt
about
.
An
'
what
tha
'll
*NL*
find
out
tha
'll
find
out
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
not
two
minutes
before
he
swallowed
the
last
of
his
beer
and
*NL*
waved
his
mug
solemnly
toward
the
window
which
took
in
through
the
*NL*
shrubbery
a
piece
of
the
lawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
there
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
tha
's
curious
.
Look
what
's
comin
'
across
*NL*
th
'
grass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Medlock
looked
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
gave
a
little
*NL*
shriek
and
every
man
and
woman
servant
within
hearing
bolted
across
the
*NL*
servants
'
hall
and
stood
looking
through
the
window
with
their
eyes
*NL*
almost
starting
out
of
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
Across
the
lawn
came
the
Master
of
Misselthwaite
and
he
looked
as
many
*NL*
of
them
had
never
seen
him
.
And
by
his
,
side
with
his
head
up
in
the
*NL*
air
and
his
eyes
full
of
laughter
walked
as
strongly
and
steadily
as
*NL*
any
boy
in
Yorkshire
--
Master
Colin
.
