CHAPTER
1
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
of
Dashwood
had
long
been
settled
in
Sussex
.
Their
estate
*NL*
was
large
,
and
their
residence
was
at
Norland
Park
,
in
the
centre
of
*NL*
their
property
,
where
,
for
many
generations
,
they
had
lived
in
so
*NL*
respectable
a
manner
as
to
engage
the
general
good
opinion
of
their
*NL*
surrounding
acquaintance
.
The
late
owner
of
this
estate
was
a
single
*NL*
man
,
who
lived
to
a
very
advanced
age
,
and
who
for
many
years
of
his
*NL*
life
,
had
a
constant
companion
and
housekeeper
in
his
sister
.
But
her
*NL*
death
,
which
happened
ten
years
before
his
own
,
produced
a
great
*NL*
alteration
in
his
home
;
for
to
supply
her
loss
,
he
invited
and
received
*NL*
into
his
house
the
family
of
his
nephew
Mr.
Henry
Dashwood
,
the
legal
*NL*
inheritor
of
the
Norland
estate
,
and
the
person
to
whom
he
intended
to
*NL*
bequeath
it
.
In
the
society
of
his
nephew
and
niece
,
and
their
*NL*
children
,
the
old
Gentleman
's
days
were
comfortably
spent
.
His
*NL*
attachment
to
them
all
increased
.
The
constant
attention
of
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Henry
Dashwood
to
his
wishes
,
which
proceeded
not
merely
from
*NL*
interest
,
but
from
goodness
of
heart
,
gave
him
every
degree
of
solid
*NL*
comfort
which
his
age
could
receive
;
and
the
cheerfulness
of
the
*NL*
children
added
a
relish
to
his
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
a
former
marriage
,
Mr.
Henry
Dashwood
had
one
son
:
by
his
present
*NL*
lady
,
three
daughters
.
The
son
,
a
steady
respectable
young
man
,
was
*NL*
amply
provided
for
by
the
fortune
of
his
mother
,
which
had
been
large
,
*NL*
and
half
of
which
devolved
on
him
on
his
coming
of
age
.
By
his
own
*NL*
marriage
,
likewise
,
which
happened
soon
afterwards
,
he
added
to
his
*NL*
wealth
.
To
him
therefore
the
succession
to
the
Norland
estate
was
not
*NL*
so
really
important
as
to
his
sisters
;
for
their
fortune
,
independent
*NL*
of
what
might
arise
to
them
from
their
father
's
inheriting
that
*NL*
property
,
could
be
but
small
.
Their
mother
had
nothing
,
and
their
*NL*
father
only
seven
thousand
pounds
in
his
own
disposal
;
for
the
*NL*
remaining
moiety
of
his
first
wife
's
fortune
was
also
secured
to
her
*NL*
child
,
and
he
had
only
a
life-interest
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
died
:
his
will
was
read
,
and
like
almost
every
other
*NL*
will
,
gave
as
much
disappointment
as
pleasure
.
He
was
neither
so
*NL*
unjust
,
nor
so
ungrateful
,
as
to
leave
his
estate
from
his
nephew
;
--
but
*NL*
he
left
it
to
him
on
such
terms
as
destroyed
half
the
value
of
the
*NL*
bequest
.
Mr.
Dashwood
had
wished
for
it
more
for
the
sake
of
his
wife
*NL*
and
daughters
than
for
himself
or
his
son
;
--
but
to
his
son
,
and
his
*NL*
son
's
son
,
a
child
of
four
years
old
,
it
was
secured
,
in
such
a
way
,
as
*NL*
to
leave
to
himself
no
power
of
providing
for
those
who
were
most
dear
*NL*
to
him
,
and
who
most
needed
a
provision
by
any
charge
on
the
estate
,
or
*NL*
by
any
sale
of
its
valuable
woods
.
The
whole
was
tied
up
for
the
*NL*
benefit
of
this
child
,
who
,
in
occasional
visits
with
his
father
and
*NL*
mother
at
Norland
,
had
so
far
gained
on
the
affections
of
his
uncle
,
by
*NL*
such
attractions
as
are
by
no
means
unusual
in
children
of
two
or
three
*NL*
years
old
;
an
imperfect
articulation
,
an
earnest
desire
of
having
his
*NL*
own
way
,
many
cunning
tricks
,
and
a
great
deal
of
noise
,
as
to
outweigh
*NL*
all
the
value
of
all
the
attention
which
,
for
years
,
he
had
received
*NL*
from
his
niece
and
her
daughters
.
He
meant
not
to
be
unkind
,
however
,
*NL*
and
,
as
a
mark
of
his
affection
for
the
three
girls
,
he
left
them
a
*NL*
thousand
pounds
a-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dashwood
's
disappointment
was
,
at
first
,
severe
;
but
his
temper
was
*NL*
cheerful
and
sanguine
;
and
he
might
reasonably
hope
to
live
many
years
,
*NL*
and
by
living
economically
,
lay
by
a
considerable
sum
from
the
produce
*NL*
of
an
estate
already
large
,
and
capable
of
almost
immediate
*NL*
improvement
.
But
the
fortune
,
which
had
been
so
tardy
in
coming
,
was
*NL*
his
only
one
twelvemonth
.
He
survived
his
uncle
no
longer
;
and
ten
*NL*
thousand
pounds
,
including
the
late
legacies
,
was
all
that
remained
for
*NL*
his
widow
and
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
son
was
sent
for
as
soon
as
his
danger
was
known
,
and
to
him
Mr.
*NL*
Dashwood
recommended
,
with
all
the
strength
and
urgency
which
illness
*NL*
could
command
,
the
interest
of
his
mother-in-law
and
sisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
John
Dashwood
had
not
the
strong
feelings
of
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
family
;
but
he
was
affected
by
a
recommendation
of
such
a
nature
at
*NL*
such
a
time
,
and
he
promised
to
do
every
thing
in
his
power
to
make
*NL*
them
comfortable
.
His
father
was
rendered
easy
by
such
an
assurance
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
John
Dashwood
had
then
leisure
to
consider
how
much
there
might
*NL*
prudently
be
in
his
power
to
do
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
an
ill-disposed
young
man
,
unless
to
be
rather
cold
hearted
*NL*
and
rather
selfish
is
to
be
ill-disposed
:
but
he
was
,
in
general
,
well
*NL*
respected
;
for
he
conducted
himself
with
propriety
in
the
discharge
of
*NL*
his
ordinary
duties
.
Had
he
married
a
more
amiable
woman
,
he
might
*NL*
have
been
made
still
more
respectable
than
he
was
:
--
he
might
even
have
*NL*
been
made
amiable
himself
;
for
he
was
very
young
when
he
married
,
and
*NL*
very
fond
of
his
wife
.
But
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
was
a
strong
caricature
*NL*
of
himself
;
--
more
narrow-minded
and
selfish
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
gave
his
promise
to
his
father
,
he
meditated
within
himself
to
*NL*
increase
the
fortunes
of
his
sisters
by
the
present
of
a
thousand
*NL*
pounds
a-piece
.
He
then
really
thought
himself
equal
to
it
.
The
*NL*
prospect
of
four
thousand
a-year
,
in
addition
to
his
present
income
,
*NL*
besides
the
remaining
half
of
his
own
mother
's
fortune
,
warmed
his
*NL*
heart
,
and
made
him
feel
capable
of
generosity
.
--
``
Yes
,
he
would
give
*NL*
them
three
thousand
pounds
:
it
would
be
liberal
and
handsome
!
It
would
*NL*
be
enough
to
make
them
completely
easy
.
Three
thousand
pounds
!
he
*NL*
could
spare
so
considerable
a
sum
with
little
inconvenience
.
''
--
He
*NL*
thought
of
it
all
day
long
,
and
for
many
days
successively
,
and
he
did
*NL*
not
repent
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
was
his
father
's
funeral
over
,
than
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
,
*NL*
without
sending
any
notice
of
her
intention
to
her
mother-in-law
,
*NL*
arrived
with
her
child
and
their
attendants
.
No
one
could
dispute
her
*NL*
right
to
come
;
the
house
was
her
husband
's
from
the
moment
of
his
*NL*
father
's
decease
;
but
the
indelicacy
of
her
conduct
was
so
much
the
*NL*
greater
,
and
to
a
woman
in
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
situation
,
with
only
common
*NL*
feelings
,
must
have
been
highly
unpleasing
;
--
but
in
HER
mind
there
was
*NL*
a
sense
of
honor
so
keen
,
a
generosity
so
romantic
,
that
any
offence
of
*NL*
the
kind
,
by
whomsoever
given
or
received
,
was
to
her
a
source
of
*NL*
immovable
disgust
.
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
had
never
been
a
favourite
with
*NL*
any
of
her
husband
's
family
;
but
she
had
had
no
opportunity
,
till
the
*NL*
present
,
of
shewing
them
with
how
little
attention
to
the
comfort
of
*NL*
other
people
she
could
act
when
occasion
required
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
acutely
did
Mrs.
Dashwood
feel
this
ungracious
behaviour
,
and
so
*NL*
earnestly
did
she
despise
her
daughter-in-law
for
it
,
that
,
on
the
*NL*
arrival
of
the
latter
,
she
would
have
quitted
the
house
for
ever
,
had
*NL*
not
the
entreaty
of
her
eldest
girl
induced
her
first
to
reflect
on
the
*NL*
propriety
of
going
,
and
her
own
tender
love
for
all
her
three
children
*NL*
determined
her
afterwards
to
stay
,
and
for
their
sakes
avoid
a
breach
*NL*
with
their
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
this
eldest
daughter
,
whose
advice
was
so
effectual
,
possessed
*NL*
a
strength
of
understanding
,
and
coolness
of
judgment
,
which
qualified
*NL*
her
,
though
only
nineteen
,
to
be
the
counsellor
of
her
mother
,
and
*NL*
enabled
her
frequently
to
counteract
,
to
the
advantage
of
them
all
,
*NL*
that
eagerness
of
mind
in
Mrs.
Dashwood
which
must
generally
have
led
*NL*
to
imprudence
.
She
had
an
excellent
heart
;
--
her
disposition
was
*NL*
affectionate
,
and
her
feelings
were
strong
;
but
she
knew
how
to
govern
*NL*
them
:
it
was
a
knowledge
which
her
mother
had
yet
to
learn
;
and
which
*NL*
one
of
her
sisters
had
resolved
never
to
be
taught
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
's
abilities
were
,
in
many
respects
,
quite
equal
to
Elinor
's
.
*NL*
She
was
sensible
and
clever
;
but
eager
in
everything
:
her
sorrows
,
her
*NL*
joys
,
could
have
no
moderation
.
She
was
generous
,
amiable
,
*NL*
interesting
:
she
was
everything
but
prudent
.
The
resemblance
between
*NL*
her
and
her
mother
was
strikingly
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
saw
,
with
concern
,
the
excess
of
her
sister
's
sensibility
;
but
*NL*
by
Mrs.
Dashwood
it
was
valued
and
cherished
.
They
encouraged
each
*NL*
other
now
in
the
violence
of
their
affliction
.
The
agony
of
grief
*NL*
which
overpowered
them
at
first
,
was
voluntarily
renewed
,
was
sought
*NL*
for
,
was
created
again
and
again
.
They
gave
themselves
up
wholly
to
*NL*
their
sorrow
,
seeking
increase
of
wretchedness
in
every
reflection
that
*NL*
could
afford
it
,
and
resolved
against
ever
admitting
consolation
in
*NL*
future
.
Elinor
,
too
,
was
deeply
afflicted
;
but
still
she
could
*NL*
struggle
,
she
could
exert
herself
.
She
could
consult
with
her
brother
,
*NL*
could
receive
her
sister-in-law
on
her
arrival
,
and
treat
her
with
*NL*
proper
attention
;
and
could
strive
to
rouse
her
mother
to
similar
*NL*
exertion
,
and
encourage
her
to
similar
forbearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
,
the
other
sister
,
was
a
good-humored
,
well-disposed
girl
;
but
*NL*
as
she
had
already
imbibed
a
good
deal
of
Marianne
's
romance
,
without
*NL*
having
much
of
her
sense
,
she
did
not
,
at
thirteen
,
bid
fair
to
equal
*NL*
her
sisters
at
a
more
advanced
period
of
life
.

CHAPTER
2
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
now
installed
herself
mistress
of
Norland
;
and
her
*NL*
mother
and
sisters-in-law
were
degraded
to
the
condition
of
visitors
.
*NL*
As
such
,
however
,
they
were
treated
by
her
with
quiet
civility
;
and
by
*NL*
her
husband
with
as
much
kindness
as
he
could
feel
towards
anybody
*NL*
beyond
himself
,
his
wife
,
and
their
child
.
He
really
pressed
them
,
*NL*
with
some
earnestness
,
to
consider
Norland
as
their
home
;
and
,
as
no
*NL*
plan
appeared
so
eligible
to
Mrs.
Dashwood
as
remaining
there
till
she
*NL*
could
accommodate
herself
with
a
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
his
*NL*
invitation
was
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
continuance
in
a
place
where
everything
reminded
her
of
former
*NL*
delight
,
was
exactly
what
suited
her
mind
.
In
seasons
of
cheerfulness
,
*NL*
no
temper
could
be
more
cheerful
than
hers
,
or
possess
,
in
a
greater
*NL*
degree
,
that
sanguine
expectation
of
happiness
which
is
happiness
*NL*
itself
.
But
in
sorrow
she
must
be
equally
carried
away
by
her
fancy
,
*NL*
and
as
far
beyond
consolation
as
in
pleasure
she
was
beyond
alloy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
did
not
at
all
approve
of
what
her
husband
intended
*NL*
to
do
for
his
sisters
.
To
take
three
thousand
pounds
from
the
fortune
*NL*
of
their
dear
little
boy
would
be
impoverishing
him
to
the
most
*NL*
dreadful
degree
.
She
begged
him
to
think
again
on
the
subject
.
How
*NL*
could
he
answer
it
to
himself
to
rob
his
child
,
and
his
only
child
too
,
*NL*
of
so
large
a
sum
?
And
what
possible
claim
could
the
Miss
Dashwoods
,
*NL*
who
were
related
to
him
only
by
half
blood
,
which
she
considered
as
no
*NL*
relationship
at
all
,
have
on
his
generosity
to
so
large
an
amount
.
It
*NL*
was
very
well
known
that
no
affection
was
ever
supposed
to
exist
*NL*
between
the
children
of
any
man
by
different
marriages
;
and
why
was
he
*NL*
to
ruin
himself
,
and
their
poor
little
Harry
,
by
giving
away
all
his
*NL*
money
to
his
half
sisters
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
father
's
last
request
to
me
,
''
replied
her
husband
,
``
that
I
*NL*
should
assist
his
widow
and
daughters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
know
what
he
was
talking
of
,
I
dare
say
;
ten
to
one
but
he
*NL*
was
light-headed
at
the
time
.
Had
he
been
in
his
right
senses
,
he
*NL*
could
not
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
begging
you
to
give
away
half
*NL*
your
fortune
from
your
own
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
stipulate
for
any
particular
sum
,
my
dear
Fanny
;
he
only
*NL*
requested
me
,
in
general
terms
,
to
assist
them
,
and
make
their
*NL*
situation
more
comfortable
than
it
was
in
his
power
to
do
.
Perhaps
it
*NL*
would
have
been
as
well
if
he
had
left
it
wholly
to
myself
.
He
could
*NL*
hardly
suppose
I
should
neglect
them
.
But
as
he
required
the
promise
,
*NL*
I
could
not
do
less
than
give
it
;
at
least
I
thought
so
at
the
time
.
*NL*
The
promise
,
therefore
,
was
given
,
and
must
be
performed
.
Something
*NL*
must
be
done
for
them
whenever
they
leave
Norland
and
settle
in
a
new
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
LET
something
be
done
for
them
;
but
THAT
something
need
*NL*
not
be
three
thousand
pounds
.
Consider
,
''
she
added
,
``
that
when
the
*NL*
money
is
once
parted
with
,
it
never
can
return
.
Your
sisters
will
*NL*
marry
,
and
it
will
be
gone
for
ever
.
If
,
indeed
,
it
could
be
restored
*NL*
to
our
poor
little
boy
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
to
be
sure

said
her
husband
,
very
gravely
,
``
that
would
make
*NL*
great
difference

The
time

come
when
Harry

regret

sum
was
parted
with

If
he
should
have
a
numerous

*NL*
*NL*

I
would
not

to
do

''
he
replied
.
``
One
had
rather
,
*NL*
on
such
occasions
,
do
too
much
than

No

*NL*
*NL*

to
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
--
and
I
think
I
may
afford
to
give
them
five
hundred

As
it
is
,
without
any
addition
of
mine
,
they
will
each
have

about
three

a
very
comfortable
*NL*
fortune
for
any
young
woman

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
it
is
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
strikes
me
that
they
can
want
no
*NL*
addition
at
all
.
They
will
have
ten
thousand
pounds
divided
amongst
*NL*
them

If
they

of
doing
well

ten

*NL*

That

very
true

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be

she
,
``

is
better
than
parting
with
fifteen
hundred
*NL*

at
once
.
But
,
then
,
if
Mrs.

should
live
fifteen
years
*NL*
we
shall
be
completely
taken
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
years
!
my
dear
Fanny
;
her
life
can
not
be
worth
half
that
*NL*
purchase
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
;
but
if
you
observe
,
people
always
live
for
ever
when
*NL*
there
is
an
annuity
to
be
paid
them
;
and
she
is
very
stout
and
healthy
,
*NL*
and
hardly
forty
.
An
annuity
is
a
very
serious
business
;
it
comes
over
*NL*
and
over
every
year
,
and
there
is
no
getting
rid
of
it
.
You
are
not
*NL*
aware
of
what
you
are
doing
.
I
have
known
a
great
deal
of
the
trouble
*NL*
of
annuities
;
for
my
mother
was
clogged
with
the
payment
of
three
to
*NL*
old
superannuated
servants
by
my
father
's
will
,
and
it
is
amazing
how
*NL*
disagreeable
she
found
it
.
Twice
every
year
these
annuities
were
to
be
*NL*
paid
;
and
then
there
was
the
trouble
of
getting
it
to
them
;
and
then
*NL*
one
of
them
was
said
to
have
died
,
and
afterwards
it
turned
out
to
be
*NL*
no
such
thing
.
My
mother
was
quite
sick
of
it
.
Her
income
was
not
her
*NL*
own
,
she
said
,
with
such
perpetual
claims
on
it
;
and
it
was
the
more
*NL*
unkind
in
my
father
,
because
,
otherwise
,
the
money
would
have
been
*NL*
entirely
at
my
mother
's
disposal
,
without
any
restriction
whatever
.
It
*NL*
has
given
me
such
an
abhorrence
of
annuities
,
that
I
am
sure
I
would
*NL*
not
pin
myself
down
to
the
payment
of
one
for
all
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
certainly
an
unpleasant
thing
,
''
replied
Mr.
Dashwood
,
``
to
have
*NL*
those
kind
of
yearly
drains
on
one
's
income
.
One
's
fortune
,
as
your
*NL*
mother
justly
says
,
is
NOT
one
's
own
.
To
be
tied
down
to
the
regular
*NL*
payment
of
such
a
sum
,
on
every
rent
day
,
is
by
no
means
desirable
:
it
*NL*
takes
away
one
's
independence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
;
and
after
all
you
have
no
thanks
for
it
.
They
think
*NL*
themselves
secure
,
you
do
no
more
than
what
is
expected
,
and
it
raises
*NL*
no
gratitude
at
all
.
If
I
were
you
,
whatever
I
did
should
be
done
at
*NL*
my
own
discretion
entirely
.
I
would
not
bind
myself
to
allow
them
any
*NL*
thing
yearly
.
It
may
be
very
inconvenient
some
years
to
spare
a
*NL*
hundred
,
or
even
fifty
pounds
from
our
own
expenses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
are
right
,
my
love

it
will
be
better
that
there
should
*NL*
be
no
annuity
in
the
case
;
whatever
I
may
give
them
occasionally
will
*NL*
be
of
far
greater
assistance
than
a
yearly
allowance
,
because
they
*NL*
would
only
enlarge
their
style
of
living
if
they
felt
sure
of
a
larger
*NL*
income
,
and
would
not
be
sixpence
the
richer
for
it
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
year
.
It
will
certainly
be
much
the
best
way
.
A
present
of
fifty
*NL*
pounds
,
now
and
then
,
will
prevent
their
ever
being
distressed
for
*NL*
money
,
and
will
,
I
think
,
be
amply
discharging
my
promise
to
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
it
will
.
Indeed
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
am
convinced
within
*NL*
myself
that
your
father
had
no
idea
of
your
giving
them
any
money
at
*NL*
all
.
The
assistance
he
thought
of
,
I
dare
say
,
was
only
such
as
might
*NL*
be
reasonably
expected
of
you
;
for
instance
,
such
as
looking
out
for
a
*NL*
comfortable
small
house
for
them
,
helping
them
to
move
their
things
,
*NL*
and
sending
them
presents
of
fish
and
game
,
and
so
forth
,
whenever
they
*NL*
are
in
season
.
I
'll
lay
my
life
that
he
meant
nothing
farther
;
indeed
,
*NL*
it
would
be
very
strange
and
unreasonable
if
he
did
.
Do
but
consider
,
*NL*
my
dear
Mr.
Dashwood
,
how
excessively
comfortable
your
mother-in-law
*NL*
and
her
daughters
may
live
on
the
interest
of
seven
thousand
pounds
,
*NL*
besides
the
thousand
pounds
belonging
to
each
of
the
girls
,
which
*NL*
brings
them
in
fifty
pounds
a
year
a-piece
,
and
,
of
course
,
they
will
*NL*
pay
their
mother
for
their
board
out
of
it
.
Altogether
,
they
will
have
*NL*
five
hundred
a-year
amongst
them
,
and
what
on
earth
can
four
women
want
*NL*
for
more
than
that
?
--
They
will
live
so
cheap
!
Their
housekeeping
will
*NL*
be
nothing
at
all
.
They
will
have
no
carriage
,
no
horses
,
and
hardly
*NL*
any
servants
;
they
will
keep
no
company
,
and
can
have
no
expenses
of
*NL*
any
kind
!
Only
conceive
how
comfortable
they
will
be
!
Five
hundred
a
*NL*
year
!
I
am
sure
I
can
not
imagine
how
they
will
spend
half
of
it
;
and
as
*NL*
to
your
giving
them
more
,
it
is
quite
absurd
to
think
of
it
.
They
will
*NL*
be
much
more
able
to
give
YOU
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
said
Mr.
Dashwood
,
``
I
believe
you
are
perfectly
right
.
*NL*
My
father
certainly
could
mean
nothing
more
by
his
request
to
me
than
*NL*
what
you
say
.
I
clearly
understand
it
now
,
and
I
will
strictly
fulfil
*NL*
my
engagement
by
such
acts
of
assistance
and
kindness
to
them
as
you
*NL*
have
described
.
When
my
mother
removes
into
another
house
my
services
*NL*
shall
be
readily
given
to
accommodate
her
as
far
as
I
can
.
Some
little
*NL*
present
of
furniture
too
may
be
acceptable
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
returned
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
.
``
But
,
however
,
ONE
thing
*NL*
must
be
considered
.
When
your
father
and
mother
moved
to
Norland
,
*NL*
though
the
furniture
of
Stanhill
was
sold
,
all
the
china
,
plate
,
and
*NL*
linen
was
saved
,
and
is
now
left
to
your
mother
.
Her
house
will
*NL*
therefore
be
almost
completely
fitted
up
as
soon
as
she
takes
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
material
consideration
undoubtedly
.
A
valuable
legacy
*NL*
indeed
!
And
yet
some
of
the
plate
would
have
been
a
very
pleasant
*NL*
addition
to
our
own
stock
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
the
set
of
breakfast
china
is
twice
as
handsome
as
what
*NL*
belongs
to
this
house
.
A
great
deal
too
handsome
,
in
my
opinion
,
for
*NL*
any
place
THEY
can
ever
afford
to
live
in
.
But
,
however
,
so
it
is
.
*NL*
Your
father
thought
only
of
THEM
.
And
I
must
say
this
:
that
you
owe
no
*NL*
particular
gratitude
to
him
,
nor
attention
to
his
wishes
;
for
we
very
*NL*
well
know
that
if
he
could
,
he
would
have
left
almost
everything
in
the
*NL*
world
to
THEM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
argument
was
irresistible
.
It
gave
to
his
intentions
whatever
of
*NL*
decision
was
wanting
before
;
and
he
finally
resolved
,
that
it
would
be
*NL*
absolutely
unnecessary
,
if
not
highly
indecorous
,
to
do
more
for
the
*NL*
widow
and
children
of
his
father
,
than
such
kind
of
neighbourly
acts
as
*NL*
his
own
wife
pointed
out
.

CHAPTER
3
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
remained
at
Norland
several
months
;
not
from
any
*NL*
disinclination
to
move
when
the
sight
of
every
well
known
spot
ceased
*NL*
to
raise
the
violent
emotion
which
it
produced
for
a
while
;
for
when
*NL*
her
spirits
began
to
revive
,
and
her
mind
became
capable
of
some
other
*NL*
exertion
than
that
of
heightening
its
affliction
by
melancholy
*NL*
remembrances
,
she
was
impatient
to
be
gone
,
and
indefatigable
in
her
*NL*
inquiries
for
a
suitable
dwelling
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Norland
;
for
*NL*
to
remove
far
from
that
beloved
spot
was
impossible
.
But
she
could
*NL*
hear
of
no
situation
that
at
once
answered
her
notions
of
comfort
and
*NL*
ease
,
and
suited
the
prudence
of
her
eldest
daughter
,
whose
steadier
*NL*
judgment
rejected
several
houses
as
too
large
for
their
income
,
which
*NL*
her
mother
would
have
approved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
had
been
informed
by
her
husband
of
the
solemn
promise
on
*NL*
the
part
of
his
son
in
their
favour
,
which
gave
comfort
to
his
last
*NL*
earthly
reflections
.
She
doubted
the
sincerity
of
this
assurance
no
*NL*
more
than
he
had
doubted
it
himself
,
and
she
thought
of
it
for
her
*NL*
daughters
'
sake
with
satisfaction
,
though
as
for
herself
she
was
*NL*
persuaded
that
a
much
smaller
provision
than
7000L
would
support
her
in
*NL*
affluence
.
For
their
brother
's
sake
,
too
,
for
the
sake
of
his
own
*NL*
heart
,
she
rejoiced
;
and
she
reproached
herself
for
being
unjust
to
his
*NL*
merit
before
,
in
believing
him
incapable
of
generosity
.
His
attentive
*NL*
behaviour
to
herself
and
his
sisters
convinced
her
that
their
welfare
*NL*
was
dear
to
him
,
and
,
for
a
long
time
,
she
firmly
relied
on
the
*NL*
liberality
of
his
intentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
contempt
which
she
had
,
very
early
in
their
acquaintance
,
felt
for
*NL*
her
daughter-in-law
,
was
very
much
increased
by
the
farther
knowledge
*NL*
of
her
character
,
which
half
a
year
's
residence
in
her
family
afforded
;
*NL*
and
perhaps
in
spite
of
every
consideration
of
politeness
or
maternal
*NL*
affection
on
the
side
of
the
former
,
the
two
ladies
might
have
found
it
*NL*
impossible
to
have
lived
together
so
long
,
had
not
a
particular
*NL*
circumstance
occurred
to
give
still
greater
eligibility
,
according
to
*NL*
the
opinions
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
to
her
daughters
'
continuance
at
Norland
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
circumstance
was
a
growing
attachment
between
her
eldest
girl
and
*NL*
the
brother
of
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
,
a
gentleman-like
and
pleasing
young
*NL*
man
,
who
was
introduced
to
their
acquaintance
soon
after
his
sister
's
*NL*
establishment
at
Norland
,
and
who
had
since
spent
the
greatest
part
of
*NL*
his
time
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
mothers
might
have
encouraged
the
intimacy
from
motives
of
*NL*
interest
,
for
Edward
Ferrars
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
man
who
had
died
*NL*
very
rich
;
and
some
might
have
repressed
it
from
motives
of
prudence
,
*NL*
for
,
except
a
trifling
sum
,
the
whole
of
his
fortune
depended
on
the
*NL*
will
of
his
mother
.
But
Mrs.
Dashwood
was
alike
uninfluenced
by
either
*NL*
consideration
.
It
was
enough
for
her
that
he
appeared
to
be
amiable
,
*NL*
that
he
loved
her
daughter
,
and
that
Elinor
returned
the
partiality
.
*NL*
It
was
contrary
to
every
doctrine
of
hers
that
difference
of
fortune
*NL*
should
keep
any
couple
asunder
who
were
attracted
by
resemblance
of
*NL*
disposition
;
and
that
Elinor
's
merit
should
not
be
acknowledged
by
*NL*
every
one
who
knew
her
,
was
to
her
comprehension
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
Ferrars
was
not
recommended
to
their
good
opinion
by
any
*NL*
peculiar
graces
of
person
or
address
.
He
was
not
handsome
,
and
his
*NL*
manners
required
intimacy
to
make
them
pleasing
.
He
was
too
diffident
*NL*
to
do
justice
to
himself
;
but
when
his
natural
shyness
was
overcome
,
*NL*
his
behaviour
gave
every
indication
of
an
open
,
affectionate
heart
.
*NL*
His
understanding
was
good
,
and
his
education
had
given
it
solid
*NL*
improvement
.
But
he
was
neither
fitted
by
abilities
nor
disposition
to
*NL*
answer
the
wishes
of
his
mother
and
sister
,
who
longed
to
see
him
*NL*
distinguished
--
as
--
they
hardly
knew
what
.
They
wanted
him
to
make
a
*NL*
fine
figure
in
the
world
in
some
manner
or
other
.
His
mother
wished
to
*NL*
interest
him
in
political
concerns
,
to
get
him
into
parliament
,
or
to
*NL*
see
him
connected
with
some
of
the
great
men
of
the
day
.
Mrs.
John
*NL*
Dashwood
wished
it
likewise
;
but
in
the
mean
while
,
till
one
of
these
*NL*
superior
blessings
could
be
attained
,
it
would
have
quieted
her
*NL*
ambition
to
see
him
driving
a
barouche
.
But
Edward
had
no
turn
for
*NL*
great
men
or
barouches
.
All
his
wishes
centered
in
domestic
comfort
*NL*
and
the
quiet
of
private
life
.
Fortunately
he
had
a
younger
brother
*NL*
who
was
more
promising
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
had
been
staying
several
weeks
in
the
house
before
he
engaged
*NL*
much
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
attention
;
for
she
was
,
at
that
time
,
in
such
*NL*
affliction
as
rendered
her
careless
of
surrounding
objects
.
She
saw
*NL*
only
that
he
was
quiet
and
unobtrusive
,
and
she
liked
him
for
it
.
He
*NL*
did
not
disturb
the
wretchedness
of
her
mind
by
ill-timed
conversation
.
*NL*
She
was
first
called
to
observe
and
approve
him
farther
,
by
a
*NL*
reflection
which
Elinor
chanced
one
day
to
make
on
the
difference
*NL*
between
him
and
his
sister
.
It
was
a
contrast
which
recommended
him
*NL*
most
forcibly
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
enough
,
''
said
she
;
``
to
say
that
he
is
unlike
Fanny
is
enough
.
*NL*
It
implies
everything
amiable
.
I
love
him
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
will
like
him
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
when
you
know
more
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
him
!
''
replied
her
mother
with
a
smile
.
``
I
feel
no
sentiment
of
*NL*
approbation
inferior
to
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
esteem
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
yet
known
what
it
was
to
separate
esteem
and
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
now
took
pains
to
get
acquainted
with
him
.
Her
manners
*NL*
were
attaching
,
and
soon
banished
his
reserve
.
She
speedily
*NL*
comprehended
all
his
merits
;
the
persuasion
of
his
regard
for
Elinor
*NL*
perhaps
assisted
her
penetration
;
but
she
really
felt
assured
of
his
*NL*
worth
:
and
even
that
quietness
of
manner
,
which
militated
against
all
*NL*
her
established
ideas
of
what
a
young
man
's
address
ought
to
be
,
was
no
*NL*
longer
uninteresting
when
she
knew
his
heart
to
be
warm
and
his
temper
*NL*
affectionate
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
did
she
perceive
any
symptom
of
love
in
his
behaviour
to
*NL*
Elinor
,
than
she
considered
their
serious
attachment
as
certain
,
and
*NL*
looked
forward
to
their
marriage
as
rapidly
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
few
months
,
my
dear
Marianne
.
''
said
she
,
``
Elinor
will
,
in
all
*NL*
probability
be
settled
for
life
.
We
shall
miss
her
;
but
SHE
will
be
*NL*
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Mama
,
how
shall
we
do
without
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
it
will
be
scarcely
a
separation
.
We
shall
live
within
a
few
*NL*
miles
of
each
other
,
and
shall
meet
every
day
of
our
lives
.
You
will
*NL*
gain
a
brother
,
a
real
,
affectionate
brother
.
I
have
the
highest
*NL*
opinion
in
the
world
of
Edward
's
heart
.
But
you
look
grave
,
Marianne
;
*NL*
do
you
disapprove
your
sister
's
choice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Marianne
,
``
I
may
consider
it
with
some
surprise
.
*NL*
Edward
is
very
amiable
,
and
I
love
him
tenderly
.
But
yet
--
he
is
not
*NL*
the
kind
of
young
man
--
there
is
something
wanting
--
his
figure
is
not
*NL*
striking
;
it
has
none
of
that
grace
which
I
should
expect
in
the
man
*NL*
who
could
seriously
attach
my
sister
.
His
eyes
want
all
that
spirit
,
*NL*
that
fire
,
which
at
once
announce
virtue
and
intelligence
.
And
besides
*NL*
all
this
,
I
am
afraid
,
Mama
,
he
has
no
real
taste
.
Music
seems
*NL*
scarcely
to
attract
him
,
and
though
he
admires
Elinor
's
drawings
very
*NL*
much
,
it
is
not
the
admiration
of
a
person
who
can
understand
their
*NL*
worth
.
It
is
evident
,
in
spite
of
his
frequent
attention
to
her
while
*NL*
she
draws
,
that
in
fact
he
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
.
He
admires
as
*NL*
a
lover
,
not
as
a
connoisseur
.
To
satisfy
me
,
those
characters
must
be
*NL*
united
.
I
could
not
be
happy
with
a
man
whose
taste
did
not
in
every
*NL*
point
coincide
with
my
own
.
He
must
enter
into
all
my
feelings
;
the
*NL*
same
books
,
the
same
music
must
charm
us
both
.
Oh
!
mama
,
how
*NL*
spiritless
,
how
tame
was
Edward
's
manner
in
reading
to
us
last
night
!
*NL*
I
felt
for
my
sister
most
severely
.
Yet
she
bore
it
with
so
much
*NL*
composure
,
she
seemed
scarcely
to
notice
it
.
I
could
hardly
keep
my
*NL*
seat
.
To
hear
those
beautiful
lines
which
have
frequently
almost
*NL*
driven
me
wild
,
pronounced
with
such
impenetrable
calmness
,
such
*NL*
dreadful
indifference
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
certainly
have
done
more
justice
to
simple
and
elegant
prose
.
*NL*
I
thought
so
at
the
time
;
but
you
WOULD
give
him
Cowper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Mama
,
if
he
is
not
to
be
animated
by
Cowper
!
--
but
we
must
allow
*NL*
for
difference
of
taste
.
Elinor
has
not
my
feelings
,
and
therefore
she
*NL*
may
overlook
it
,
and
be
happy
with
him
.
But
it
would
have
broke
MY
*NL*
heart
,
had
I
loved
him
,
to
hear
him
read
with
so
little
sensibility
.
*NL*
Mama
,
the
more
I
know
of
the
world
,
the
more
am
I
convinced
that
I
*NL*
shall
never
see
a
man
whom
I
can
really
love
.
I
require
so
much
!
He
*NL*
must
have
all
Edward
's
virtues
,
and
his
person
and
manners
must
*NL*
ornament
his
goodness
with
every
possible
charm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
my
love
,
that
you
are
not
seventeen

It
is
yet
too
early
in

life
to
despair
of
such
a
happiness
.
Why
should
you
be
less
fortunate
*NL*
than
your
mother
?
In
one
circumstance
only
,
my
Marianne

may
your

destiny
be
different

CHAPTER
4
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
it
is
,
Elinor
,
''
said
Marianne
,
``
that
Edward
should
have
no
*NL*
taste
for
drawing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
taste
for
drawing
!
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
why
should
you
think
so
?
He
*NL*
does
not
draw
himself
,
indeed
,
but
he
has
great
pleasure
in
seeing
the
*NL*
performances
of
other
people
,
and
I
assure
you
he
is
by
no
means
*NL*
deficient
in
natural
taste
,
though
he
has
not
had
opportunities
of
*NL*
improving
it
.
Had
he
ever
been
in
the
way
of
learning
,
I
think
he
*NL*
would
have
drawn
very
well
.
He
distrusts
his
own
judgment
in
such
*NL*
matters
so
much
,
that
he
is
always
unwilling
to
give
his
opinion
on
any
*NL*
picture
;
but
he
has
an
innate
propriety
and
simplicity
of
taste
,
which
*NL*
in
general
direct
him
perfectly
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
was
afraid
of
offending
,
and
said
no
more
on
the
subject
;
but
*NL*
the
kind
of
approbation
which
Elinor
described
as
excited
in
him
by
the
*NL*
drawings
of
other
people
,
was
very
far
from
that
rapturous
delight
,
*NL*
which
,
in
her
opinion
,
could
alone
be
called
taste
.
Yet
,
though
*NL*
smiling
within
herself
at
the
mistake
,
she
honoured
her
sister
for
that
*NL*
blind
partiality
to
Edward
which
produced
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
Marianne
,
''
continued
Elinor
,
``
you
do
not
consider
him
as
*NL*
deficient
in
general
taste
.
Indeed
,
I
think
I
may
say
that
you
can
not
,
*NL*
for
your
behaviour
to
him
is
perfectly
cordial
,
and
if
THAT
were
your
*NL*
opinion
,
I
am
sure
you
could
never
be
civil
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
hardly
knew
what
to
say
.
She
would
not
wound
the
feelings
of
*NL*
her
sister
on
any
account
,
and
yet
to
say
what
she
did
not
believe
was
*NL*
impossible
.
At
length
she
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
offended
,
Elinor
,
if
my
praise
of
him
is
not
in
every
thing
*NL*
equal
to
your
sense
of
his
merits
.
I
have
not
had
so
many
*NL*
opportunities
of
estimating
the
minuter
propensities
of
his
mind
,
his
*NL*
inclinations
and
tastes
,
as
you
have
;
but
I
have
the
highest
opinion
in
*NL*
the
world
of
his
goodness
and
sense
.
I
think
him
every
thing
that
is
*NL*
worthy
and
amiable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
with
a
smile
,
``
that
his
dearest
friends
*NL*
could
not
be
dissatisfied
with
such
commendation
as
that
.
I
do
not
*NL*
perceive
how
you
could
express
yourself
more
warmly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
was
rejoiced
to
find
her
sister
so
easily
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
his
sense
and
his
goodness
,
''
continued
Elinor
,
``
no
one
can
,
I
*NL*
think
,
be
in
doubt
,
who
has
seen
him
often
enough
to
engage
him
in
*NL*
unreserved
conversation
.
The
excellence
of
his
understanding
and
his
*NL*
principles
can
be
concealed
only
by
that
shyness
which
too
often
keeps
*NL*
him
silent
.
You
know
enough
of
him
to
do
justice
to
his
solid
worth
.
*NL*
But
of
his
minuter
propensities
,
as
you
call
them
you
have
from
*NL*
peculiar
circumstances
been
kept
more
ignorant
than
myself
.
He
and
I
*NL*
have
been
at
times
thrown
a
good
deal
together
,
while
you
have
been
*NL*
wholly
engrossed
on
the
most
affectionate
principle
by
my
mother
.
I
*NL*
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
him
,
have
studied
his
sentiments
and
heard
*NL*
his
opinion
on
subjects
of
literature
and
taste
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
*NL*
venture
to
pronounce
that
his
mind
is
well-informed
,
enjoyment
of
books
*NL*
exceedingly
great
,
his
imagination
lively
,
his
observation
just
and
*NL*
correct
,
and
his
taste
delicate
and
pure
.
His
abilities
in
every
*NL*
respect
improve
as
much
upon
acquaintance
as
his
manners
and
person
.
*NL*
At
first
sight
,
his
address
is
certainly
not
striking
;
and
his
person
*NL*
can
hardly
be
called
handsome
,
till
the
expression
of
his
eyes
,
which
*NL*
are
uncommonly
good
,
and
the
general
sweetness
of
his
countenance
,
is
*NL*
perceived
.
At
present
,
I
know
him
so
well
,
that
I
think
him
really
*NL*
handsome
;
or
at
least
,
almost
so
.
What
say
you
,
Marianne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
very
soon
think
him
handsome
,
Elinor
,
if
I
do
not
now
.
When
*NL*
you
tell
me
to
love
him
as
a
brother
,
I
shall
no
more
see
imperfection
*NL*
in
his
face
,
than
I
now
do
in
his
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
started
at
this
declaration
,
and
was
sorry
for
the
warmth
she
*NL*
had
been
betrayed
into
,
in
speaking
of
him
.
She
felt
that
Edward
stood
*NL*
very
high
in
her
opinion
.
She
believed
the
regard
to
be
mutual
;
but
*NL*
she
required
greater
certainty
of
it
to
make
Marianne
's
conviction
of
*NL*
their
attachment
agreeable
to
her
.
She
knew
that
what
Marianne
and
her
*NL*
mother
conjectured
one
moment
,
they
believed
the
next
--
that
with
them
,
*NL*
to
wish
was
to
hope
,
and
to
hope
was
to
expect
.
She
tried
to
explain
*NL*
the
real
state
of
the
case
to
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
attempt
to
deny
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
I
think
very
highly
of
*NL*
him
--
that
I
greatly
esteem
,
that
I
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
here
burst
forth
with
indignation
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Esteem
him
!
Like
him
!
Cold-hearted
Elinor
!
Oh
!
worse
than
*NL*
cold-hearted
!
Ashamed
of
being
otherwise
.
Use
those
words
again
,
and
I
*NL*
will
leave
the
room
this
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
not
help
laughing
.
``
Excuse
me
,
''
said
she
;
``
and
be
assured
*NL*
that
I
meant
no
offence
to
you
,
by
speaking
,
in
so
quiet
a
way

of
my
*NL*
own
feelings

Believe
them
to
be
stronger
than
I
have
declared
;
*NL*
believe
them
,
in
short
,
to
be
such
as
his
merit
,
and
the
suspicion
--
the
*NL*
hope
of
his
affection
for
me
may
warrant
,
without
imprudence
or
folly
.
*NL*
But
farther
than
this
you
must
not
believe
.
I
am
by
no
means
assured
*NL*
of
his
regard
for
me
.
There
are
moments
when
the
extent
of
it
seems
*NL*
doubtful
;
and
till
his
sentiments
are
fully
known
,
you
can
not
wonder
at
*NL*
my
wishing
to
avoid
any
encouragement
of
my
own
partiality
,
by
*NL*
believing
or
calling
it
more
than
it
is
.
In
my
heart
I
feel
*NL*
little
--
scarcely
any
doubt
of
his
preference
.
But
there
are
other
*NL*
points
to
be
considered
besides
his
inclination
.
He
is
very
far
from
*NL*
being
independent
.
What
his
mother
really
is
we
can
not
know
;
but
,
from
*NL*
Fanny
's
occasional
mention
of
her
conduct
and
opinions
,
we
have
never
*NL*
been
disposed
to
think
her
amiable
;
and
I
am
very
much
mistaken
if
*NL*
Edward
is
not
himself
aware
that
there
would
be
many
difficulties
in
*NL*
his
way
,
if
he
were
to
wish
to
marry
a
woman
who
had
not
either
a
great
*NL*
fortune
or
high
rank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
was
astonished
to
find
how
much
the
imagination
of
her
mother
*NL*
and
herself
had
outstripped
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
really
are
not
engaged
to
him
!
''
said
she
.
``
Yet
it
certainly
*NL*
soon
will
happen
.
But
two
advantages
will
proceed
from
this
delay
.
I
*NL*
shall
not
lose
you
so
soon
,
and
Edward
will
have
greater
opportunity
of
*NL*
improving
that
natural
taste
for
your
favourite
pursuit
which
must
be
*NL*
so
indispensably
necessary
to
your
future
felicity
.
Oh
!
if
he
should
*NL*
be
so
far
stimulated
by
your
genius
as
to
learn
to
draw
himself
,
how
*NL*
delightful
it
would
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
had
given
her
real
opinion
to
her
sister
.
She
could
not
*NL*
consider
her
partiality
for
Edward
in
so
prosperous
a
state
as
Marianne
*NL*
had
believed
it
.
There
was
,
at
times
,
a
want
of
spirits
about
him
*NL*
which
,
if
it
did
not
denote
indifference
,
spoke
of
something
almost
as
*NL*
unpromising
.
A
doubt
of
her
regard
,
supposing
him
to
feel
it
,
need
not
*NL*
give
him
more
than
inquietude
.
It
would
not
be
likely
to
produce
that
*NL*
dejection
of
mind
which
frequently
attended
him
.
A
more
reasonable
*NL*
cause
might
be
found
in
the
dependent
situation
which
forbade
the
*NL*
indulgence
of
his
affection
.
She
knew
that
his
mother
neither
behaved
*NL*
to
him
so
as
to
make
his
home
comfortable
at
present
,
nor
to
give
him
*NL*
any
assurance
that
he
might
form
a
home
for
himself
,
without
strictly
*NL*
attending
to
her
views
for
his
aggrandizement
.
With
such
a
knowledge
*NL*
as
this
,
it
was
impossible
for
Elinor
to
feel
easy
on
the
subject
.
She
*NL*
was
far
from
depending
on
that
result
of
his
preference
of
her
,
which
*NL*
her
mother
and
sister
still
considered
as
certain
.
Nay
,
the
longer
*NL*
they
were
together
the
more
doubtful
seemed
the
nature
of
his
regard
;
*NL*
and
sometimes
,
for
a
few
painful
minutes
,
she
believed
it
to
be
no
more
*NL*
than
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
whatever
might
really
be
its
limits
,
it
was
enough
,
when
perceived
*NL*
by
his
sister
,
to
make
her
uneasy
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
-LRB-
which
was
*NL*
still
more
common
,
-RRB-
to
make
her
uncivil
.
She
took
the
first
*NL*
opportunity
of
affronting
her
mother-in-law
on
the
occasion
,
talking
to
*NL*
her
so
expressively
of
her
brother
's
great
expectations
,
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Ferrars
's
resolution
that
both
her
sons
should
marry
well
,
and
of
the
*NL*
danger
attending
any
young
woman
who
attempted
to
DRAW
HIM
IN
;
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
could
neither
pretend
to
be
unconscious
,
nor
endeavor
to
*NL*
be
calm
.
She
gave
her
an
answer
which
marked
her
contempt
,
and
*NL*
instantly
left
the
room
,
resolving
that
,
whatever
might
be
the
*NL*
inconvenience
or
expense
of
so
sudden
a
removal
,
her
beloved
Elinor
*NL*
should
not
be
exposed
another
week
to
such
insinuations
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
state
of
her
spirits
,
a
letter
was
delivered
to
her
from
the
*NL*
post
,
which
contained
a
proposal
particularly
well
timed
.
It
was
the
*NL*
offer
of
a
small
house
,
on
very
easy
terms
,
belonging
to
a
relation
of
*NL*
her
own
,
a
gentleman
of
consequence
and
property
in
Devonshire
.
The
*NL*
letter
was
from
this
gentleman
himself
,
and
written
in
the
true
spirit
*NL*
of
friendly
accommodation
.
He
understood
that
she
was
in
need
of
a
*NL*
dwelling
;
and
though
the
house
he
now
offered
her
was
merely
a
cottage
,
*NL*
he
assured
her
that
everything
should
be
done
to
it
which
she
might
*NL*
think
necessary
,
if
the
situation
pleased
her
.
He
earnestly
pressed
*NL*
her
,
after
giving
the
particulars
of
the
house
and
garden
,
to
come
with
*NL*
her
daughters
to
Barton
Park
,
the
place
of
his
own
residence
,
from
*NL*
whence
she
might
judge
,
herself
,
whether
Barton
Cottage
,
for
the
houses
*NL*
were
in
the
same
parish
,
could
,
by
any
alteration
,
be
made
comfortable
*NL*
to
her
.
He
seemed
really
anxious
to
accommodate
them
and
the
whole
of
*NL*
his
letter
was
written
in
so
friendly
a
style
as
could
not
fail
of
*NL*
giving
pleasure
to
his
cousin
;
more
especially
at
a
moment
when
she
was
*NL*
suffering
under
the
cold
and
unfeeling
behaviour
of
her
nearer
*NL*
connections
.
She
needed
no
time
for
deliberation
or
inquiry
.
Her
*NL*
resolution
was
formed
as
she
read
.
The
situation
of
Barton
,
in
a
*NL*
county
so
far
distant
from
Sussex
as
Devonshire
,
which
,
but
a
few
hours
*NL*
before
,
would
have
been
a
sufficient
objection
to
outweigh
every
*NL*
possible
advantage
belonging
to
the
place
,
was
now
its
first
*NL*
recommendation
.
To
quit
the
neighbourhood
of
Norland
was
no
longer
an
*NL*
evil
;
it
was
an
object
of
desire
;
it
was
a
blessing
,
in
comparison
of
*NL*
the
misery
of
continuing
her
daughter-in-law
's
guest
;
and
to
remove
for
*NL*
ever
from
that
beloved
place
would
be
less
painful
than
to
inhabit
or
*NL*
visit
it
while
such
a
woman
was
its
mistress
.
She
instantly
wrote
Sir
*NL*
John
Middleton
her
acknowledgment
of
his
kindness
,
and
her
acceptance
*NL*
of
his
proposal
;
and
then
hastened
to
shew
both
letters
to
her
*NL*
daughters
,
that
she
might
be
secure
of
their
approbation
before
her
*NL*
answer
were
sent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
had
always
thought
it
would
be
more
prudent
for
them
to
settle
*NL*
at
some
distance
from
Norland
,
than
immediately
amongst
their
present
*NL*
acquaintance
.
On
THAT
head
,
therefore
,
it
was
not
for
her
to
oppose
*NL*
her
mother
's
intention
of
removing
into
Devonshire
.
The
house
,
too
,
as
*NL*
described
by
Sir
John
,
was
on
so
simple
a
scale
,
and
the
rent
so
*NL*
uncommonly
moderate
,
as
to
leave
her
no
right
of
objection
on
either
*NL*
point
;
and
,
therefore
,
though
it
was
not
a
plan
which
brought
any
charm
*NL*
to
her
fancy
,
though
it
was
a
removal
from
the
vicinity
of
Norland
*NL*
beyond
her
wishes
,
she
made
no
attempt
to
dissuade
her
mother
from
*NL*
sending
a
letter
of
acquiescence
.

CHAPTER
5
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
was
her
answer
dispatched
,
than
Mrs.
Dashwood
indulged
herself
*NL*
in
the
pleasure
of
announcing
to
her
son-in-law
and
his
wife
that
she
*NL*
was
provided
with
a
house
,
and
should
incommode
them
no
longer
than
till
*NL*
every
thing
were
ready
for
her
inhabiting
it
.
They
heard
her
with
*NL*
surprise
.
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
said
nothing
;
but
her
husband
civilly
hoped
*NL*
that
she
would
not
be
settled
far
from
Norland
.
She
had
great
*NL*
satisfaction
in
replying
that
she
was
going
into
Devonshire
.
--
Edward
*NL*
turned
hastily
towards
her
,
on
hearing
this
,
and
,
in
a
voice
of
surprise
*NL*
and
concern
,
which
required
no
explanation
to
her
,
repeated
,
*NL*
``
Devonshire
!
Are
you
,
indeed
,
going
there
?
So
far
from
hence
!
And
to
*NL*
what
part
of
it
?
''
She
explained
the
situation
.
It
was
within
four
miles
*NL*
northward
of
Exeter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
but
a
cottage
,
''
she
continued
,
``
but
I
hope
to
see
many
of
my
*NL*
friends
in
it
.
A
room
or
two
can
easily
be
added
;
and
if
my
friends
*NL*
find
no
difficulty
in
travelling
so
far
to
see
me
,
I
am
sure
I
will
*NL*
find
none
in
accommodating
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
concluded
with
a
very
kind
invitation
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
*NL*
to
visit
her
at
Barton
;
and
to
Edward
she
gave
one
with
still
greater
*NL*
affection
.
Though
her
late
conversation
with
her
daughter-in-law
had
*NL*
made
her
resolve
on
remaining
at
Norland
no
longer
than
was
*NL*
unavoidable
,
it
had
not
produced
the
smallest
effect
on
her
in
that
*NL*
point
to
which
it
principally
tended
.
To
separate
Edward
and
Elinor
*NL*
was
as
far
from
being
her
object
as
ever
;
and
she
wished
to
show
Mrs.
*NL*
John
Dashwood
,
by
this
pointed
invitation
to
her
brother
,
how
totally
*NL*
she
disregarded
her
disapprobation
of
the
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
John
Dashwood
told
his
mother
again
and
again
how
exceedingly
sorry
*NL*
he
was
that
she
had
taken
a
house
at
such
a
distance
from
Norland
as
to
*NL*
prevent
his
being
of
any
service
to
her
in
removing
her
furniture
.
He
*NL*
really
felt
conscientiously
vexed
on
the
occasion
;
for
the
very
*NL*
exertion
to
which
he
had
limited
the
performance
of
his
promise
to
his
*NL*
father
was
by
this
arrangement
rendered
impracticable
.
--
The
furniture
*NL*
was
all
sent
around
by
water
.
It
chiefly
consisted
of
household
linen
,
*NL*
plate
,
china
,
and
books
,
with
a
handsome
pianoforte
of
Marianne
's
.
*NL*
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
saw
the
packages
depart
with
a
sigh
:
she
could
not
*NL*
help
feeling
it
hard
that
as
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
income
would
be
so
*NL*
trifling
in
comparison
with
their
own
,
she
should
have
any
handsome
*NL*
article
of
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
took
the
house
for
a
twelvemonth
;
it
was
ready
furnished
,
*NL*
and
she
might
have
immediate
possession
.
No
difficulty
arose
on
either
*NL*
side
in
the
agreement
;
and
she
waited
only
for
the
disposal
of
her
*NL*
effects
at
Norland
,
and
to
determine
her
future
household
,
before
she
*NL*
set
off
for
the
west
;
and
this
,
as
she
was
exceedingly
rapid
in
the
*NL*
performance
of
everything
that
interested
her
,
was
soon
done
.
--
The
*NL*
horses
which
were
left
her
by
her
husband
had
been
sold
soon
after
his
*NL*
death
,
and
an
opportunity
now
offering
of
disposing
of
her
carriage
,
*NL*
she
agreed
to
sell
that
likewise
at
the
earnest
advice
of
her
eldest
*NL*
daughter
.
For
the
comfort
of
her
children
,
had
she
consulted
only
her
*NL*
own
wishes
,
she
would
have
kept
it
;
but
the
discretion
of
Elinor
*NL*
prevailed
.
HER
wisdom
too
limited
the
number
of
their
servants
to
*NL*
three
;
two
maids
and
a
man
,
with
whom
they
were
speedily
provided
from
*NL*
amongst
those
who
had
formed
their
establishment
at
Norland
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
and
one
of
the
maids
were
sent
off
immediately
into
Devonshire
,
*NL*
to
prepare
the
house
for
their
mistress
's
arrival
;
for
as
Lady
*NL*
Middleton
was
entirely
unknown
to
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
she
preferred
going
*NL*
directly
to
the
cottage
to
being
a
visitor
at
Barton
Park
;
and
she
*NL*
relied
so
undoubtingly
on
Sir
John
's
description
of
the
house
,
as
to
*NL*
feel
no
curiosity
to
examine
it
herself
till
she
entered
it
as
her
own
.
*NL*
Her
eagerness
to
be
gone
from
Norland
was
preserved
from
diminution
by
*NL*
the
evident
satisfaction
of
her
daughter-in-law
in
the
prospect
of
her
*NL*
removal
;
a
satisfaction
which
was
but
feebly
attempted
to
be
concealed
*NL*
under
a
cold
invitation
to
her
to
defer
her
departure
.
Now
was
the
*NL*
time
when
her
son-in-law
's
promise
to
his
father
might
with
particular
*NL*
propriety
be
fulfilled
.
Since
he
had
neglected
to
do
it
on
first
*NL*
coming
to
the
estate
,
their
quitting
his
house
might
be
looked
on
as
*NL*
the
most
suitable
period
for
its
accomplishment
.
But
Mrs.
Dashwood
*NL*
began
shortly
to
give
over
every
hope
of
the
kind
,
and
to
be
convinced
,
*NL*
from
the
general
drift
of
his
discourse
,
that
his
assistance
extended
*NL*
no
farther
than
their
maintenance
for
six
months
at
Norland
.
He
so
*NL*
frequently
talked
of
the
increasing
expenses
of
housekeeping
,
and
of
*NL*
the
perpetual
demands
upon
his
purse
,
which
a
man
of
any
consequence
in
*NL*
the
world
was
beyond
calculation
exposed
to
,
that
he
seemed
rather
to
*NL*
stand
in
need
of
more
money
himself
than
to
have
any
design
of
giving
*NL*
money
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
very
few
weeks
from
the
day
which
brought
Sir
John
Middleton
's
*NL*
first
letter
to
Norland
,
every
thing
was
so
far
settled
in
their
future
*NL*
abode
as
to
enable
Mrs.
Dashwood
and
her
daughters
to
begin
their
*NL*
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
were
the
tears
shed
by
them
in
their
last
adieus
to
a
place
so
*NL*
much
beloved
.
``
Dear
,
dear
Norland
!
''
said
Marianne
,
as
she
wandered
*NL*
alone
before
the
house
,
on
the
last
evening
of
their
being
there
;
``
when
*NL*
shall
I
cease
to
regret
you
!
--
when
learn
to
feel
a
home
elsewhere
!
--
Oh
!
*NL*
happy
house
,
could
you
know
what
I
suffer
in
now
viewing
you
from
this
*NL*
spot
,
from
whence
perhaps
I
may
view
you
no
more
!
--
And
you
,
ye
*NL*
well-known
trees
!
--
but
you
will
continue
the
same
.
--
No
leaf
will
decay
*NL*
because
we
are
removed
,
nor
any
branch
become
motionless
although
we
*NL*
can
observe
you
no
longer
!
--
No
;
you
will
continue
the
same
;
unconscious
*NL*
of
the
pleasure
or
the
regret
you
occasion
,
and
insensible
of
any
*NL*
change
in
those
who
walk
under
your
shade
!
--
But
who
will
remain
to
*NL*
enjoy
you
?

CHAPTER
6
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
part
of
their
journey
was
performed
in
too
melancholy
a
*NL*
disposition
to
be
otherwise
than
tedious
and
unpleasant
.
But
as
they
*NL*
drew
towards
the
end
of
it
,
their
interest
in
the
appearance
of
a
*NL*
country
which
they
were
to
inhabit
overcame
their
dejection
,
and
a
view
*NL*
of
Barton
Valley
as
they
entered
it
gave
them
cheerfulness
.
It
was
a
*NL*
pleasant
fertile
spot
,
well
wooded
,
and
rich
in
pasture
.
After
winding
*NL*
along
it
for
more
than
a
mile
,
they
reached
their
own
house
.
A
small
*NL*
green
court
was
the
whole
of
its
demesne
in
front
;
and
a
neat
wicket
*NL*
gate
admitted
them
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
house
,
Barton
Cottage
,
though
small
,
was
comfortable
and
compact
;
*NL*
but
as
a
cottage
it
was
defective
,
for
the
building
was
regular
,
the
*NL*
roof
was
tiled
,
the
window
shutters
were
not
painted
green
,
nor
were
*NL*
the
walls
covered
with
honeysuckles
.
A
narrow
passage
led
directly
*NL*
through
the
house
into
the
garden
behind
.
On
each
side
of
the
entrance
*NL*
was
a
sitting
room
,
about
sixteen
feet
square
;
and
beyond
them
were
the
*NL*
offices
and
the
stairs
.
Four
bed-rooms
and
two
garrets
formed
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
house
.
It
had
not
been
built
many
years
and
was
in
good
repair
.
*NL*
In
comparison
of
Norland
,
it
was
poor
and
small
indeed
!
--
but
the
tears
*NL*
which
recollection
called
forth
as
they
entered
the
house
were
soon
*NL*
dried
away
.
They
were
cheered
by
the
joy
of
the
servants
on
their
*NL*
arrival
,
and
each
for
the
sake
of
the
others
resolved
to
appear
happy
.
*NL*
It
was
very
early
in
September
;
the
season
was
fine
,
and
from
first
*NL*
seeing
the
place
under
the
advantage
of
good
weather
,
they
received
an
*NL*
impression
in
its
favour
which
was
of
material
service
in
recommending
*NL*
it
to
their
lasting
approbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
of
the
house
was
good
.
High
hills
rose
immediately
*NL*
behind
,
and
at
no
great
distance
on
each
side
;
some
of
which
were
open
*NL*
downs
,
the
others
cultivated
and
woody
.
The
village
of
Barton
was
*NL*
chiefly
on
one
of
these
hills
,
and
formed
a
pleasant
view
from
the
*NL*
cottage
windows
.
The
prospect
in
front
was
more
extensive
;
it
*NL*
commanded
the
whole
of
the
valley
,
and
reached
into
the
country
beyond
.
*NL*
The
hills
which
surrounded
the
cottage
terminated
the
valley
in
that
*NL*
direction
;
under
another
name
,
and
in
another
course
,
it
branched
out
*NL*
again
between
two
of
the
steepest
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
size
and
furniture
of
the
house
Mrs.
Dashwood
was
upon
the
*NL*
whole
well
satisfied
;
for
though
her
former
style
of
life
rendered
many
*NL*
additions
to
the
latter
indispensable
,
yet
to
add
and
improve
was
a
*NL*
delight
to
her
;
and
she
had
at
this
time
ready
money
enough
to
supply
*NL*
all
that
was
wanted
of
greater
elegance
to
the
apartments
.
``
As
for
the
*NL*
house
itself
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
is
too
small
for
our
family
,
*NL*
but
we
will
make
ourselves
tolerably
comfortable
for
the
present
,
as
it
*NL*
is
too
late
in
the
year
for
improvements
.
Perhaps
in
the
spring
,
if
I
*NL*
have
plenty
of
money
,
as
I
dare
say
I
shall
,
we
may
think
about
*NL*
building
.
These
parlors
are
both
too
small
for
such
parties
of
our
*NL*
friends
as
I
hope
to
see
often
collected
here
;
and
I
have
some
thoughts
*NL*
of
throwing
the
passage
into
one
of
them
with
perhaps
a
part
of
the
*NL*
other
,
and
so
leave
the
remainder
of
that
other
for
an
entrance
;
this
,
*NL*
with
a
new
drawing
room
which
may
be
easily
added
,
and
a
bed-chamber
*NL*
and
garret
above
,
will
make
it
a
very
snug
little
cottage
.
I
could
*NL*
wish
the
stairs
were
handsome
.
But
one
must
not
expect
every
thing
;
*NL*
though
I
suppose
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
widen
them
.
I
*NL*
shall
see
how
much
I
am
before-hand
with
the
world
in
the
spring
,
and
*NL*
we
will
plan
our
improvements
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mean
time
,
till
all
these
alterations
could
be
made
from
the
*NL*
savings
of
an
income
of
five
hundred
a-year
by
a
woman
who
never
saved
*NL*
in
her
life
,
they
were
wise
enough
to
be
contented
with
the
house
as
it
*NL*
was
;
and
each
of
them
was
busy
in
arranging
their
particular
concerns
,
*NL*
and
endeavoring
,
by
placing
around
them
books
and
other
possessions
,
to
*NL*
form
themselves
a
home
.
Marianne
's
pianoforte
was
unpacked
and
*NL*
properly
disposed
of
;
and
Elinor
's
drawings
were
affixed
to
the
walls
*NL*
of
their
sitting
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
employments
as
these
they
were
interrupted
soon
after
breakfast
*NL*
the
next
day
by
the
entrance
of
their
landlord
,
who
called
to
welcome
*NL*
them
to
Barton
,
and
to
offer
them
every
accommodation
from
his
own
*NL*
house
and
garden
in
which
theirs
might
at
present
be
deficient
.
Sir
*NL*
John
Middleton
was
a
good
looking
man
about
forty
.
He
had
formerly
*NL*
visited
at
Stanhill
,
but
it
was
too
long
for
his
young
cousins
to
*NL*
remember
him
.
His
countenance
was
thoroughly
good-humoured
;
and
his
*NL*
manners
were
as
friendly
as
the
style
of
his
letter
.
Their
arrival
*NL*
seemed
to
afford
him
real
satisfaction
,
and
their
comfort
to
be
an
*NL*
object
of
real
solicitude
to
him
.
He
said
much
of
his
earnest
desire
*NL*
of
their
living
in
the
most
sociable
terms
with
his
family
,
and
pressed
*NL*
them
so
cordially
to
dine
at
Barton
Park
every
day
till
they
were
*NL*
better
settled
at
home
,
that
,
though
his
entreaties
were
carried
to
a
*NL*
point
of
perseverance
beyond
civility
,
they
could
not
give
offence
.
*NL*
His
kindness
was
not
confined
to
words
;
for
within
an
hour
after
he
*NL*
left
them
,
a
large
basket
full
of
garden
stuff
and
fruit
arrived
from
*NL*
the
park
,
which
was
followed
before
the
end
of
the
day
by
a
present
of
*NL*
game
.
He
insisted
,
moreover
,
on
conveying
all
their
letters
to
and
*NL*
from
the
post
for
them
,
and
would
not
be
denied
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
sending
them
his
newspaper
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Middleton
had
sent
a
very
civil
message
by
him
,
denoting
her
*NL*
intention
of
waiting
on
Mrs.
Dashwood
as
soon
as
she
could
be
assured
*NL*
that
her
visit
would
be
no
inconvenience
;
and
as
this
message
was
*NL*
answered
by
an
invitation
equally
polite
,
her
ladyship
was
introduced
*NL*
to
them
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
,
of
course
,
very
anxious
to
see
a
person
on
whom
so
much
of
*NL*
their
comfort
at
Barton
must
depend
;
and
the
elegance
of
her
appearance
*NL*
was
favourable
to
their
wishes
.
Lady
Middleton
was
not
more
than
six
*NL*
or
seven
and
twenty
;
her
face
was
handsome
,
her
figure
tall
and
*NL*
striking
,
and
her
address
graceful
.
Her
manners
had
all
the
elegance
*NL*
which
her
husband
's
wanted
.
But
they
would
have
been
improved
by
some
*NL*
share
of
his
frankness
and
warmth
;
and
her
visit
was
long
enough
to
*NL*
detract
something
from
their
first
admiration
,
by
shewing
that
,
though
*NL*
perfectly
well-bred
,
she
was
reserved
,
cold
,
and
had
nothing
to
say
for
*NL*
herself
beyond
the
most
common-place
inquiry
or
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Conversation
however
was
not
wanted
,
for
Sir
John
was
very
chatty
,
and
*NL*
Lady
Middleton
had
taken
the
wise
precaution
of
bringing
with
her
their
*NL*
eldest
child
,
a
fine
little
boy
about
six
years
old
,
by
which
means
*NL*
there
was
one
subject
always
to
be
recurred
to
by
the
ladies
in
case
of
*NL*
extremity
,
for
they
had
to
enquire
his
name
and
age
,
admire
his
beauty
,
*NL*
and
ask
him
questions
which
his
mother
answered
for
him
,
while
he
hung
*NL*
about
her
and
held
down
his
head
,
to
the
great
surprise
of
her
*NL*
ladyship
,
who
wondered
at
his
being
so
shy
before
company
,
as
he
could
*NL*
make
noise
enough
at
home
.
On
every
formal
visit
a
child
ought
to
be
*NL*
of
the
party
,
by
way
of
provision
for
discourse
.
In
the
present
case
*NL*
it
took
up
ten
minutes
to
determine
whether
the
boy
were
most
like
his
*NL*
father
or
mother
,
and
in
what
particular
he
resembled
either
,
for
of
*NL*
course
every
body
differed
,
and
every
body
was
astonished
at
the
*NL*
opinion
of
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
opportunity
was
soon
to
be
given
to
the
Dashwoods
of
debating
on
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
children
,
as
Sir
John
would
not
leave
the
house
without
*NL*
securing
their
promise
of
dining
at
the
park
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
7
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Barton
Park
was
about
half
a
mile
from
the
cottage
.
The
ladies
had
*NL*
passed
near
it
in
their
way
along
the
valley
,
but
it
was
screened
from
*NL*
their
view
at
home
by
the
projection
of
a
hill
.
The
house
was
large
*NL*
and
handsome
;
and
the
Middletons
lived
in
a
style
of
equal
hospitality
*NL*
and
elegance
.
The
former
was
for
Sir
John
's
gratification
,
the
latter
*NL*
for
that
of
his
lady
.
They
were
scarcely
ever
without
some
friends
*NL*
staying
with
them
in
the
house
,
and
they
kept
more
company
of
every
*NL*
kind
than
any
other
family
in
the
neighbourhood
.
It
was
necessary
to
*NL*
the
happiness
of
both
;
for
however
dissimilar
in
temper
and
outward
*NL*
behaviour
,
they
strongly
resembled
each
other
in
that
total
want
of
*NL*
talent
and
taste
which
confined
their
employments
,
unconnected
with
*NL*
such
as
society
produced
,
within
a
very
narrow
compass
.
Sir
John
was
a
*NL*
sportsman
,
Lady
Middleton
a
mother
.
He
hunted
and
shot
,
and
she
*NL*
humoured
her
children
;
and
these
were
their
only
resources
.
Lady
*NL*
Middleton
had
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
spoil
her
children
all
the
*NL*
year
round
,
while
Sir
John
's
independent
employments
were
in
existence
*NL*
only
half
the
time
.
Continual
engagements
at
home
and
abroad
,
however
,
*NL*
supplied
all
the
deficiencies
of
nature
and
education
;
supported
the
*NL*
good
spirits
of
Sir
John
,
and
gave
exercise
to
the
good
breeding
of
his
*NL*
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Middleton
piqued
herself
upon
the
elegance
of
her
table
,
and
of
*NL*
all
her
domestic
arrangements
;
and
from
this
kind
of
vanity
was
her
*NL*
greatest
enjoyment
in
any
of
their
parties
.
But
Sir
John
's
*NL*
satisfaction
in
society
was
much
more
real
;
he
delighted
in
collecting
*NL*
about
him
more
young
people
than
his
house
would
hold
,
and
the
noisier
*NL*
they
were
the
better
was
he
pleased
.
He
was
a
blessing
to
all
the
*NL*
juvenile
part
of
the
neighbourhood
,
for
in
summer
he
was
for
ever
*NL*
forming
parties
to
eat
cold
ham
and
chicken
out
of
doors
,
and
in
winter
*NL*
his
private
balls
were
numerous
enough
for
any
young
lady
who
was
not
*NL*
suffering
under
the
unsatiable
appetite
of
fifteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrival
of
a
new
family
in
the
country
was
always
a
matter
of
joy
*NL*
to
him
,
and
in
every
point
of
view
he
was
charmed
with
the
inhabitants
*NL*
he
had
now
procured
for
his
cottage
at
Barton
.
The
Miss
Dashwoods
were
*NL*
young
,
pretty
,
and
unaffected
.
It
was
enough
to
secure
his
good
*NL*
opinion
;
for
to
be
unaffected
was
all
that
a
pretty
girl
could
want
to
*NL*
make
her
mind
as
captivating
as
her
person
.
The
friendliness
of
his
*NL*
disposition
made
him
happy
in
accommodating
those
,
whose
situation
*NL*
might
be
considered
,
in
comparison
with
the
past
,
as
unfortunate
.
In
*NL*
showing
kindness
to
his
cousins
therefore
he
had
the
real
satisfaction
*NL*
of
a
good
heart
;
and
in
settling
a
family
of
females
only
in
his
*NL*
cottage
,
he
had
all
the
satisfaction
of
a
sportsman
;
for
a
sportsman
,
*NL*
though
he
esteems
only
those
of
his
sex
who
are
sportsmen
likewise
,
is
*NL*
not
often
desirous
of
encouraging
their
taste
by
admitting
them
to
a
*NL*
residence
within
his
own
manor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
and
her
daughters
were
met
at
the
door
of
the
house
by
*NL*
Sir
John
,
who
welcomed
them
to
Barton
Park
with
unaffected
sincerity
;
*NL*
and
as
he
attended
them
to
the
drawing
room
repeated
to
the
young
*NL*
ladies
the
concern
which
the
same
subject
had
drawn
from
him
the
day
*NL*
before
,
at
being
unable
to
get
any
smart
young
men
to
meet
them
.
They
*NL*
would
see
,
he
said
,
only
one
gentleman
there
besides
himself
;
a
*NL*
particular
friend
who
was
staying
at
the
park
,
but
who
was
neither
very
*NL*
young
nor
very
gay
.
He
hoped
they
would
all
excuse
the
smallness
of
*NL*
the
party
,
and
could
assure
them
it
should
never
happen
so
again
.
He
*NL*
had
been
to
several
families
that
morning
in
hopes
of
procuring
some
*NL*
addition
to
their
number
,
but
it
was
moonlight
and
every
body
was
full
*NL*
of
engagements
.
Luckily
Lady
Middleton
's
mother
had
arrived
at
Barton
*NL*
within
the
last
hour
,
and
as
she
was
a
very
cheerful
agreeable
woman
,
*NL*
he
hoped
the
young
ladies
would
not
find
it
so
very
dull
as
they
might
*NL*
imagine
.
The
young
ladies
,
as
well
as
their
mother
,
were
perfectly
*NL*
satisfied
with
having
two
entire
strangers
of
the
party
,
and
wished
for
*NL*
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
,
Lady
Middleton
's
mother
,
was
a
good-humoured
,
merry
,
*NL*
fat
,
elderly
woman
,
who
talked
a
great
deal
,
seemed
very
happy
,
and
*NL*
rather
vulgar
.
She
was
full
of
jokes
and
laughter
,
and
before
dinner
*NL*
was
over
had
said
many
witty
things
on
the
subject
of
lovers
and
*NL*
husbands
;
hoped
they
had
not
left
their
hearts
behind
them
in
Sussex
,
*NL*
and
pretended
to
see
them
blush
whether
they
did
or
not
.
Marianne
was
*NL*
vexed
at
it
for
her
sister
's
sake
,
and
turned
her
eyes
towards
Elinor
*NL*
to
see
how
she
bore
these
attacks
,
with
an
earnestness
which
gave
*NL*
Elinor
far
more
pain
than
could
arise
from
such
common-place
raillery
*NL*
as
Mrs.
Jennings
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
,
the
friend
of
Sir
John
,
seemed
no
more
adapted
by
*NL*
resemblance
of
manner
to
be
his
friend
,
than
Lady
Middleton
was
to
be
*NL*
his
wife
,
or
Mrs.
Jennings
to
be
Lady
Middleton
's
mother
.
He
was
*NL*
silent
and
grave
.
His
appearance
however
was
not
unpleasing
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
his
being
in
the
opinion
of
Marianne
and
Margaret
an
absolute
old
*NL*
bachelor
,
for
he
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
five
and
thirty
;
but
though
*NL*
his
face
was
not
handsome
,
his
countenance
was
sensible
,
and
his
*NL*
address
was
particularly
gentlemanlike
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
in
any
of
the
party
which
could
recommend
them
as
*NL*
companions
to
the
Dashwoods
;
but
the
cold
insipidity
of
Lady
Middleton
*NL*
was
so
particularly
repulsive
,
that
in
comparison
of
it
the
gravity
of
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
,
and
even
the
boisterous
mirth
of
Sir
John
and
his
*NL*
mother-in-law
was
interesting
.
Lady
Middleton
seemed
to
be
roused
to
*NL*
enjoyment
only
by
the
entrance
of
her
four
noisy
children
after
dinner
,
*NL*
who
pulled
her
about
,
tore
her
clothes
,
and
put
an
end
to
every
kind
of
*NL*
discourse
except
what
related
to
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
as
Marianne
was
discovered
to
be
musical
,
she
was
*NL*
invited
to
play
.
The
instrument
was
unlocked
,
every
body
prepared
to
*NL*
be
charmed
,
and
Marianne
,
who
sang
very
well
,
at
their
request
went
*NL*
through
the
chief
of
the
songs
which
Lady
Middleton
had
brought
into
*NL*
the
family
on
her
marriage
,
and
which
perhaps
had
lain
ever
since
in
*NL*
the
same
position
on
the
pianoforte
,
for
her
ladyship
had
celebrated
*NL*
that
event
by
giving
up
music
,
although
by
her
mother
's
account
,
she
*NL*
had
played
extremely
well
,
and
by
her
own
was
very
fond
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
's
performance
was
highly
applauded
.
Sir
John
was
loud
in
his
*NL*
admiration
at
the
end
of
every
song
,
and
as
loud
in
his
conversation
*NL*
with
the
others
while
every
song
lasted
.
Lady
Middleton
frequently
*NL*
called
him
to
order
,
wondered
how
any
one
's
attention
could
be
diverted
*NL*
from
music
for
a
moment
,
and
asked
Marianne
to
sing
a
particular
song
*NL*
which
Marianne
had
just
finished
.
Colonel
Brandon
alone
,
of
all
the
*NL*
party
,
heard
her
without
being
in
raptures
.
He
paid
her
only
the
*NL*
compliment
of
attention
;
and
she
felt
a
respect
for
him
on
the
*NL*
occasion
,
which
the
others
had
reasonably
forfeited
by
their
shameless
*NL*
want
of
taste
.
His
pleasure
in
music
,
though
it
amounted
not
to
that
*NL*
ecstatic
delight
which
alone
could
sympathize
with
her
own
,
was
*NL*
estimable
when
contrasted
against
the
horrible
insensibility
of
the
*NL*
others
;
and
she
was
reasonable
enough
to
allow
that
a
man
of
five
and
*NL*
thirty
might
well
have
outlived
all
acuteness
of
feeling
and
every
*NL*
exquisite
power
of
enjoyment
.
She
was
perfectly
disposed
to
make
every
*NL*
allowance
for
the
colonel
's
advanced
state
of
life
which
humanity
*NL*
required
.

CHAPTER
8
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
was
a
widow
with
an
ample
jointure
.
She
had
only
two
*NL*
daughters
,
both
of
whom
she
had
lived
to
see
respectably
married
,
and
*NL*
she
had
now
therefore
nothing
to
do
but
to
marry
all
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
world
.
In
the
promotion
of
this
object
she
was
zealously
active
,
as
*NL*
far
as
her
ability
reached
;
and
missed
no
opportunity
of
projecting
*NL*
weddings
among
all
the
young
people
of
her
acquaintance
.
She
was
*NL*
remarkably
quick
in
the
discovery
of
attachments
,
and
had
enjoyed
the
*NL*
advantage
of
raising
the
blushes
and
the
vanity
of
many
a
young
lady
by
*NL*
insinuations
of
her
power
over
such
a
young
man
;
and
this
kind
of
*NL*
discernment
enabled
her
soon
after
her
arrival
at
Barton
decisively
to
*NL*
pronounce
that
Colonel
Brandon
was
very
much
in
love
with
Marianne
*NL*
Dashwood
.
She
rather
suspected
it
to
be
so
,
on
the
very
first
evening
*NL*
of
their
being
together
,
from
his
listening
so
attentively
while
she
*NL*
sang
to
them
;
and
when
the
visit
was
returned
by
the
Middletons
'
dining
*NL*
at
the
cottage
,
the
fact
was
ascertained
by
his
listening
to
her
again
.
*NL*
It
must
be
so
.
She
was
perfectly
convinced
of
it
.
It
would
be
an
*NL*
excellent
match
,
for
HE
was
rich
,
and
SHE
was
handsome
.
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
had
been
anxious
to
see
Colonel
Brandon
well
married
,
ever
since
her
*NL*
connection
with
Sir
John
first
brought
him
to
her
knowledge
;
and
she
*NL*
was
always
anxious
to
get
a
good
husband
for
every
pretty
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
immediate
advantage
to
herself
was
by
no
means
inconsiderable
,
for
*NL*
it
supplied
her
with
endless
jokes
against
them
both
.
At
the
park
she
*NL*
laughed
at
the
colonel
,
and
in
the
cottage
at
Marianne
.
To
the
former
*NL*
her
raillery
was
probably
,
as
far
as
it
regarded
only
himself
,
*NL*
perfectly
indifferent
;
but
to
the
latter
it
was
at
first
*NL*
incomprehensible
;
and
when
its
object
was
understood
,
she
hardly
knew
*NL*
whether
most
to
laugh
at
its
absurdity
,
or
censure
its
impertinence
,
*NL*
for
she
considered
it
as
an
unfeeling
reflection
on
the
colonel
's
*NL*
advanced
years
,
and
on
his
forlorn
condition
as
an
old
bachelor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
who
could
not
think
a
man
five
years
younger
than
*NL*
herself
,
so
exceedingly
ancient
as
he
appeared
to
the
youthful
fancy
of
*NL*
her
daughter
,
ventured
to
clear
Mrs.
Jennings
from
the
probability
of
*NL*
wishing
to
throw
ridicule
on
his
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
at
least
,
Mama
,
you
can
not
deny
the
absurdity
of
the
accusation
,
*NL*
though
you
may
not
think
it
intentionally
ill-natured
.
Colonel
Brandon
*NL*
is
certainly
younger
than
Mrs.
Jennings
,
but
he
is
old
enough
to
be
MY
*NL*
father
;
and
if
he
were
ever
animated
enough
to
be
in
love
,
must
have
*NL*
long
outlived
every
sensation
of
the
kind
.
It
is
too
ridiculous
!
When
*NL*
is
a
man
to
be
safe
from
such
wit
,
if
age
and
infirmity
will
not
*NL*
protect
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Infirmity
!
''
said
Elinor
,
``
do
you
call
Colonel
Brandon
infirm
?
I
can
*NL*
easily
suppose
that
his
age
may
appear
much
greater
to
you
than
to
my
*NL*
mother
;
but
you
can
hardly
deceive
yourself
as
to
his
having
the
use
of
*NL*
his
limbs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
not
you
hear
him
complain
of
the
rheumatism
?
and
is
not
that
the
*NL*
commonest
infirmity
of
declining
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
child
,
''
said
her
mother
,
laughing
,
``
at
this
rate
you
must
*NL*
be
in
continual
terror
of
MY
decay
;
and
it
must
seem
to
you
a
miracle
*NL*
that
my
life
has
been
extended
to
the
advanced
age
of
forty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mama
,
you
are
not
doing
me
justice
.
I
know
very
well
that
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
is
not
old
enough
to
make
his
friends
yet
apprehensive
of
*NL*
losing
him
in
the
course
of
nature
.
He
may
live
twenty
years
longer
.
*NL*
But
thirty-five
has
nothing
to
do
with
matrimony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
thirty-five
and
seventeen
had
better
not
have
*NL*
any
thing
to
do
with
matrimony
together
.
But
if
there
should
by
any
*NL*
chance
happen
to
be
a
woman
who
is
single
at
seven
and
twenty
,
I
should
*NL*
not
think
Colonel
Brandon
's
being
thirty-five
any
objection
to
his
*NL*
marrying
HER
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
of
seven
and
twenty
,
''
said
Marianne
,
after
pausing
a
moment
,
*NL*
``
can
never
hope
to
feel
or
inspire
affection
again
,
and
if
her
home
be
*NL*
uncomfortable
,
or
her
fortune
small
,
I
can
suppose
that
she
might
bring
*NL*
herself
to
submit
to
the
offices
of
a
nurse
,
for
the
sake
of
the
*NL*
provision
and
security
of
a
wife
.
In
his
marrying
such
a
woman
*NL*
therefore
there
would
be
nothing
unsuitable
.
It
would
be
a
compact
of
*NL*
convenience
,
and
the
world
would
be
satisfied
.
In
my
eyes
it
would
be
*NL*
no
marriage
at
all
,
but
that
would
be
nothing
.
To
me
it
would
seem
*NL*
only
a
commercial
exchange
,
in
which
each
wished
to
be
benefited
at
the
*NL*
expense
of
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
impossible
,
I
know
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
to
convince
you
that
*NL*
a
woman
of
seven
and
twenty
could
feel
for
a
man
of
thirty-five
*NL*
anything
near
enough
to
love
,
to
make
him
a
desirable
companion
to
her
.
*NL*
But
I
must
object
to
your
dooming
Colonel
Brandon
and
his
wife
to
the
*NL*
constant
confinement
of
a
sick
chamber
,
merely
because
he
chanced
to
*NL*
complain
yesterday
-LRB-
a
very
cold
damp
day
-RRB-
of
a
slight
rheumatic
feel
in
*NL*
one
of
his
shoulders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
talked
of
flannel
waistcoats
,
''
said
Marianne
;
``
and
with
me
a
*NL*
flannel
waistcoat
is
invariably
connected
with
aches
,
cramps
,
*NL*
rheumatisms
,
and
every
species
of
ailment
that
can
afflict
the
old
and
*NL*
the
feeble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
he
been
only
in
a
violent
fever
,
you
would
not
have
despised
him
*NL*
half
so
much

Confess
,
Marianne
,
is
not
there
something
interesting
to
*NL*
you
in
the
flushed
cheek
,
hollow
eye
,
and
quick
pulse
of
a
fever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
this
,
upon
Elinor
's
leaving
the
room
,
``
Mama

''
said
*NL*
Marianne
,
``
I
have
an
alarm

sure
Edward
Ferrars
is
not
well

We
have
now
*NL*
been
here
almost
a
fortnight
,
and
yet
he
does
not
come

Nothing
but
*NL*
real
indisposition
could
occasion
this
extraordinary
delay

*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
you
any

said
Mrs.
Dashwood

none

On
the
contrary

if
I
have
felt
any
anxiety

subject
,
it
has
been
in
recollecting
that
he
sometimes
showed
a
want
of
*NL*
pleasure
and
readiness
in
accepting
my
invitation
,
when
I
talked
of
his
*NL*
coming
to
Barton

Does
Elinor
expect
him
already

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
mentioned
it
to
her
,
but
of
course
she
must
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rather
think
you
are
mistaken

for
when
I
was
talking
to
her
*NL*
yesterday
of
getting
a
new
grate
for
the
spare
bedchamber
,
she
observed
*NL*
that
there
was
no
immediate
hurry
for
it
,
as
it
was
not
likely
that
the
*NL*
room
would
be
wanted
for
some
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
this
is

what

be
the
meaning

But
the
whole
of

each

has
been
unaccountable

How
cold

how
*NL*
composed
were
their
last
adieus
!
How
languid
their
conversation
the

last
evening
of

In
Edward

farewell
there
was
no
*NL*
distinction
between

it

the
good

Twice
did
I
leave

purposely

together
in

the

did

most

unaccountably
follow
me
out
of
the
room

And
Elinor
,
in
quitting
*NL*
Norland
and
Edward

cried
not

I
did

Even
now

self-command

dejected

CHAPTER
9
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dashwoods
were
now
settled
at
Barton
with
tolerable
comfort
to
*NL*
themselves
.
The
house
and
the
garden
,
with
all
the
objects
surrounding
*NL*
them
,
were
now
become
familiar
,
and
the
ordinary
pursuits
which
had
*NL*
given
to
Norland
half
its
charms
were
engaged
in
again
with
far
greater
*NL*
enjoyment
than
Norland
had
been
able
to
afford
,
since
the
loss
of
their
*NL*
father
.
Sir
John
Middleton
,
who
called
on
them
every
day
for
the
first
*NL*
fortnight
,
and
who
was
not
in
the
habit
of
seeing
much
occupation
at
*NL*
home
,
could
not
conceal
his
amazement
on
finding
them
always
employed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
visitors
,
except
those
from
Barton
Park
,
were
not
many
;
for
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
Sir
John
's
urgent
entreaties
that
they
would
mix
more
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
and
repeated
assurances
of
his
carriage
being
always
at
*NL*
their
service
,
the
independence
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
spirit
overcame
the
*NL*
wish
of
society
for
her
children
;
and
she
was
resolute
in
declining
to
*NL*
visit
any
family
beyond
the
distance
of
a
walk
.
There
were
but
few
who
*NL*
could
be
so
classed
;
and
it
was
not
all
of
them
that
were
attainable
.
*NL*
About
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
cottage
,
along
the
narrow
winding
*NL*
valley
of
Allenham
,
which
issued
from
that
of
Barton
,
as
formerly
*NL*
described
,
the
girls
had
,
in
one
of
their
earliest
walks
,
discovered
an
*NL*
ancient
respectable
looking
mansion
which
,
by
reminding
them
a
little
*NL*
of
Norland
,
interested
their
imagination
and
made
them
wish
to
be
*NL*
better
acquainted
with
it
.
But
they
learnt
,
on
enquiry
,
that
its
*NL*
possessor
,
an
elderly
lady
of
very
good
character
,
was
unfortunately
*NL*
too
infirm
to
mix
with
the
world
,
and
never
stirred
from
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
country
about
them
abounded
in
beautiful
walks
.
The
high
*NL*
downs
which
invited
them
from
almost
every
window
of
the
cottage
to
*NL*
seek
the
exquisite
enjoyment
of
air
on
their
summits
,
were
a
happy
*NL*
alternative
when
the
dirt
of
the
valleys
beneath
shut
up
their
superior
*NL*
beauties
;
and
towards
one
of
these
hills
did
Marianne
and
Margaret
one
*NL*
memorable
morning
direct
their
steps
,
attracted
by
the
partial
sunshine
*NL*
of
a
showery
sky
,
and
unable
longer
to
bear
the
confinement
which
the
*NL*
settled
rain
of
the
two
preceding
days
had
occasioned
.
The
weather
was
*NL*
not
tempting
enough
to
draw
the
two
others
from
their
pencil
and
their
*NL*
book
,
in
spite
of
Marianne
's
declaration
that
the
day
would
be
*NL*
lastingly
fair
,
and
that
every
threatening
cloud
would
be
drawn
off
*NL*
from
their
hills
;
and
the
two
girls
set
off
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
gaily
ascended
the
downs
,
rejoicing
in
their
own
penetration
at
*NL*
every
glimpse
of
blue
sky
;
and
when
they
caught
in
their
faces
the
*NL*
animating
gales
of
a
high
south-westerly
wind
,
they
pitied
the
fears
*NL*
which
had
prevented
their
mother
and
Elinor
from
sharing
such
*NL*
delightful
sensations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
a
felicity
in
the
world
,
''
said
Marianne
,
``
superior
to
*NL*
this
?
--
Margaret
,
we
will
walk
here
at
least
two
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
agreed
,
and
they
pursued
their
way
against
the
wind
,
resisting
*NL*
it
with
laughing
delight
for
about
twenty
minutes
longer
,
when
suddenly
*NL*
the
clouds
united
over
their
heads
,
and
a
driving
rain
set
full
in
*NL*
their
face
.
--
Chagrined
and
surprised
,
they
were
obliged
,
though
*NL*
unwillingly
,
to
turn
back
,
for
no
shelter
was
nearer
than
their
own
*NL*
house
.
One
consolation
however
remained
for
them
,
to
which
the
*NL*
exigence
of
the
moment
gave
more
than
usual
propriety
;
it
was
that
of
*NL*
running
with
all
possible
speed
down
the
steep
side
of
the
hill
which
*NL*
led
immediately
to
their
garden
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
set
off
.
Marianne
had
at
first
the
advantage
,
but
a
false
step
*NL*
brought
her
suddenly
to
the
ground
;
and
Margaret
,
unable
to
stop
*NL*
herself
to
assist
her
,
was
involuntarily
hurried
along
,
and
reached
the
*NL*
bottom
in
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gentleman
carrying
a
gun
,
with
two
pointers
playing
round
him
,
was
*NL*
passing
up
the
hill
and
within
a
few
yards
of
Marianne
,
when
her
*NL*
accident
happened
.
He
put
down
his
gun
and
ran
to
her
assistance
.
She
*NL*
had
raised
herself
from
the
ground
,
but
her
foot
had
been
twisted
in
*NL*
her
fall
,
and
she
was
scarcely
able
to
stand
.
The
gentleman
offered
*NL*
his
services
;
and
perceiving
that
her
modesty
declined
what
her
*NL*
situation
rendered
necessary
,
took
her
up
in
his
arms
without
farther
*NL*
delay
,
and
carried
her
down
the
hill
.
Then
passing
through
the
garden
,
*NL*
the
gate
of
which
had
been
left
open
by
Margaret
,
he
bore
her
directly
*NL*
into
the
house
,
whither
Margaret
was
just
arrived
,
and
quitted
not
his
*NL*
hold
till
he
had
seated
her
in
a
chair
in
the
parlour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
and
her
mother
rose
up
in
amazement
at
their
entrance
,
and
while
*NL*
the
eyes
of
both
were
fixed
on
him
with
an
evident
wonder
and
a
secret
*NL*
admiration
which
equally
sprung
from
his
appearance
,
he
apologized
for
*NL*
his
intrusion
by
relating
its
cause
,
in
a
manner
so
frank
and
so
*NL*
graceful
that
his
person
,
which
was
uncommonly
handsome
,
received
*NL*
additional
charms
from
his
voice
and
expression
.
Had
he
been
even
old
,
*NL*
ugly
,
and
vulgar
,
the
gratitude
and
kindness
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
would
*NL*
have
been
secured
by
any
act
of
attention
to
her
child
;
but
the
*NL*
influence
of
youth
,
beauty
,
and
elegance
,
gave
an
interest
to
the
*NL*
action
which
came
home
to
her
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thanked
him
again
and
again
;
and
,
with
a
sweetness
of
address
which
*NL*
always
attended
her
,
invited
him
to
be
seated
.
But
this
he
declined
,
*NL*
as
he
was
dirty
and
wet
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
then
begged
to
know
to
whom
she
*NL*
was
obliged
.
His
name
,
he
replied
,
was
Willoughby
,
and
his
present
*NL*
home
was
at
Allenham
,
from
whence
he
hoped
she
would
allow
him
the
*NL*
honour
of
calling
tomorrow
to
enquire
after
Miss
Dashwood
.
The
honour
*NL*
was
readily
granted
,
and
he
then
departed
,
to
make
himself
still
more
*NL*
interesting
,
in
the
midst
of
a
heavy
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
manly
beauty
and
more
than
common
gracefulness
were
instantly
the
*NL*
theme
of
general
admiration
,
and
the
laugh
which
his
gallantry
raised
*NL*
against
Marianne
received
particular
spirit
from
his
exterior
*NL*
attractions
.
--
Marianne
herself
had
seen
less
of
his
Mama
the
*NL*
rest
,
for
the
confusion
which
crimsoned
over
her
face
,
on
his
lifting
*NL*
her
up
,
had
robbed
her
of
the
power
of
regarding
him
after
their
*NL*
entering
the
house
.
But
she
had
seen
enough
of
him
to
join
in
all
the
*NL*
admiration
of
the
others
,
and
with
an
energy
which
always
adorned
her
*NL*
praise
.
His
person
and
air
were
equal
to
what
her
fancy
had
ever
drawn
*NL*
for
the
hero
of
a
favourite
story
;
and
in
his
carrying
her
into
the
*NL*
house
with
so
little
previous
formality
,
there
was
a
rapidity
of
*NL*
thought
which
particularly
recommended
the
action
to
her
.
Every
*NL*
circumstance
belonging
to
him
was
interesting
.
His
name
was
good
,
his
*NL*
residence
was
in
their
favourite
village
,
and
she
soon
found
out
that
*NL*
of
all
manly
dresses
a
shooting-jacket
was
the
most
becoming
.
Her
*NL*
imagination
was
busy
,
her
reflections
were
pleasant
,
and
the
pain
of
a
*NL*
sprained
ankle
was
disregarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
John
called
on
them
as
soon
as
the
next
interval
of
fair
weather
*NL*
that
morning
allowed
him
to
get
out
of
doors
;
and
Marianne
's
accident
*NL*
being
related
to
him
,
he
was
eagerly
asked
whether
he
knew
any
*NL*
gentleman
of
the
name
of
Willoughby
at
Allenham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Willoughby
!
''
cried
Sir
John
;
``
what
,
is
HE
in
the
country
?
That
is
good
*NL*
news
however
;
I
will
ride
over
tomorrow
,
and
ask
him
to
dinner
on
*NL*
Thursday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
him
then
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dashwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
him
!
to
be
sure
I
do
.
Why
,
he
is
down
here
every
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
sort
of
a
young
man
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
good
a
kind
of
fellow
as
ever
lived
,
I
assure
you
.
A
very
decent
*NL*
shot
,
and
there
is
not
a
bolder
rider
in
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
that
all
you
can
say
for
him
?
''
cried
Marianne
,
indignantly
.
*NL*
``
But
what
are
his
manners
on
more
intimate
acquaintance
?
What
his
*NL*
pursuits
,
his
talents
,
and
genius
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
John
was
rather
puzzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
do
not
know
much
about
him
as
to
all
THAT
.
*NL*
But
he
is
a
pleasant
,
good
humoured
fellow
,
and
has
got
the
nicest
*NL*
little
black
bitch
of
a
pointer
I
ever
saw
.
Was
she
out
with
him
*NL*
today
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Marianne
could
no
more
satisfy
him
as
to
the
colour
of
Mr.
*NL*
Willoughby
's
pointer
,
than
he
could
describe
to
her
the
shades
of
his
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
is
he
?
''
said
Elinor
.
``
Where
does
he
come
from
?
Has
he
a
*NL*
house
at
Allenham
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
point
Sir
John
could
give
more
certain
intelligence
;
and
he
*NL*
told
them
that
Mr.
Willoughby
had
no
property
of
his
own
in
the
*NL*
country
;
that
he
resided
there
only
while
he
was
visiting
the
old
lady
*NL*
at
Allenham
Court
,
to
whom
he
was
related
,
and
whose
possessions
he
was
*NL*
to
inherit
;
adding
,
``
Yes
,
yes
,
he
is
very
well
worth
catching
I
can
*NL*
tell
you
,
Miss
Dashwood
;
he
has
a
pretty
little
estate
of
his
own
in
*NL*
Somersetshire
besides
;
and
if
I
were
you
,
I
would
not
give
him
up
to
my
*NL*
younger
sister
,
in
spite
of
all
this
tumbling
down
hills
.
Miss
*NL*
Marianne
must
not
expect
to
have
all
the
men
to
herself
.
Brandon
will
*NL*
be
jealous
,
if
she
does
not
take
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
believe
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
with
a
good
humoured
smile
,
*NL*
``
that
Mr.
Willoughby
will
be
incommoded
by
the
attempts
of
either
of
MY
*NL*
daughters
towards
what
you
call
CATCHING
him
.
It
is
not
an
employment
*NL*
to
which
they
have
been
brought
up
.
Men
are
very
safe
with
us
,
let
*NL*
them
be
ever
so
rich
.
I
am
glad
to
find
,
however
,
from
what
you
say
,
*NL*
that
he
is
a
respectable
young
man
,
and
one
whose
acquaintance
will
not
*NL*
be
ineligible

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
as
good
a
sort
of
fellow
,
I
believe
,
as
ever
lived
,
''
repeated
*NL*
Sir
John
.
``
I
remember
last
Christmas
at
a
little
hop
at
the
park
,
he
*NL*
danced
from
eight
o'clock
till
four
,
without
once
sitting
down
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
indeed
?

cried
Marianne
with
sparkling
eyes
,
``
and
with
*NL*
elegance
,
with
spirit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
he
was
up
again
at
eight
to
ride
to
covert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
like
;
that
is
what
a
young
man
ought
to
be
.
Whatever
*NL*
be
his
pursuits
,
his
eagerness
in
them
should
know
no
moderation
,
and
*NL*
leave
him
no
sense
of
fatigue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
I
see
how
it
will
be
,
''
said
Sir
John
,
``
I
see
how
it
will
be

*NL*
You
will
be
setting
your
cap
at
him
now
,

never
think
of
poor
*NL*
Brandon

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
an
expression
,
Sir
John
,
''
said
Marianne
,
warmly
,
``
which
I
*NL*
particularly
dislike

I
abhor
every
common-place
phrase

`
setting
one

cap
at
a
man

*NL*
are
the
most
odious
of

Their

is
gross

illiberal
;

clever

time
has
long

destroyed

*NL*
*NL*
Sir

did
not
much
understand

reproof

he
laughed
as

heartily
as
if

did

then
replied

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

you

make

one

quite
smitten
already

he
is
very
well
worth

setting
your

I
can
tell
you

this
tumbling

CHAPTER
10
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
's
preserver
,
as
Margaret
,
with
more
elegance
than
precision
,
*NL*
styled
Willoughby
,
called
at
the
cottage
early
the
next
morning
to
make
*NL*
his
personal
enquiries
.
He
was
received
by
Mrs.
Dashwood
with
more
*NL*
than
politeness
;
with
a
kindness
which
Sir
John
's
account
of
him
and
*NL*
her
own
gratitude
prompted
;
and
every
thing
that
passed
during
the
*NL*
visit
tended
to
assure
him
of
the
sense
,
elegance
,
mutual
affection
,
*NL*
and
domestic
comfort
of
the
family
to
whom
accident
had
now
introduced
*NL*
him
.
Of
their
personal
charms
he
had
not
required
a
second
interview
*NL*
to
be
convinced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Dashwood
had
a
delicate
complexion
,
regular
features
,
and
a
*NL*
remarkably
pretty
figure
.
Marianne
was
still
handsomer
.
Her
form
,
*NL*
though
not
so
correct
as
her
sister
's
,
in
having
the
advantage
of
*NL*
height
,
was
more
striking
;
and
her
face
was
so
lovely
,
that
when
in
the
*NL*
common
cant
of
praise
,
she
was
called
a
beautiful
girl
,
truth
was
less
*NL*
violently
outraged
than
usually
happens
.
Her
skin
was
very
brown
,
but
,
*NL*
from
its
transparency
,
her
complexion
was
uncommonly
brilliant
;
her
*NL*
features
were
all
good
;
her
smile
was
sweet
and
attractive
;
and
in
her
*NL*
eyes
,
which
were
very
dark
,
there
was
a
life
,
a
spirit
,
an
eagerness
,
*NL*
which
could
hardily
be
seen
without
delight
.
From
Willoughby
their
*NL*
expression
was
at
first
held
back
,
by
the
embarrassment
which
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
his
assistance
created
.
But
when
this
passed
away
,
when
*NL*
her
spirits
became
collected
,
when
she
saw
that
to
the
perfect
*NL*
good-breeding
of
the
gentleman
,
he
united
frankness
and
vivacity
,
and
*NL*
above
all
,
when
she
heard
him
declare
,
that
of
music
and
dancing
he
was
*NL*
passionately
fond
,
she
gave
him
such
a
look
of
approbation
as
secured
*NL*
the
largest
share
of
his
discourse
to
herself
for
the
rest
of
his
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
necessary
to
mention
any
favourite
amusement
to
engage
her
*NL*
to
talk
.
She
could
not
be
silent
when
such
points
were
introduced
,
and
*NL*
she
had
neither
shyness
nor
reserve
in
their
discussion
.
They
speedily
*NL*
discovered
that
their
enjoyment
of
dancing
and
music
was
mutual
,
and
*NL*
that
it
arose
from
a
general
conformity
of
judgment
in
all
that
related
*NL*
to
either
.
Encouraged
by
this
to
a
further
examination
of
his
*NL*
opinions
,
she
proceeded
to
question
him
on
the
subject
of
books
;
her
*NL*
favourite
authors
were
brought
forward
and
dwelt
upon
with
so
rapturous
*NL*
a
delight
,
that
any
young
man
of
five
and
twenty
must
have
been
*NL*
insensible
indeed
,
not
to
become
an
immediate
convert
to
the
excellence
*NL*
of
such
works
,
however
disregarded
before
.
Their
taste
was
strikingly
*NL*
alike
.
The
same
books
,
the
same
passages
were
idolized
by
each
--
or
if
*NL*
any
difference
appeared
,
any
objection
arose
,
it
lasted
no
longer
than
*NL*
till
the
force
of
her
arguments
and
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
could
be
*NL*
displayed
.
He
acquiesced
in
all
her
decisions
,
caught
all
her
*NL*
enthusiasm
;
and
long
before
his
visit
concluded
,
they
conversed
with
*NL*
the
familiarity
of
a
long-established
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Marianne
,
''
said
Elinor
,
as
soon
as
he
had
left
them
,
``
for
ONE
*NL*
morning
I
think
you
have
done
pretty
well
.
You
have
already
*NL*
ascertained
Mr.
Willoughby
's
opinion
in
almost
every
matter
of
*NL*
importance
.
You
know
what
he
thinks
of
Cowper
and
Scott
;
you
are
*NL*
certain
of
his
estimating
their
beauties
as
he
ought
,
and
you
have
*NL*
received
every
assurance
of
his
admiring
Pope
no
more
than
is
proper
.
*NL*
But
how
is
your
acquaintance
to
be
long
supported
,
under
such
*NL*
extraordinary
despatch
of
every
subject
for
discourse
?
You
will
soon
*NL*
have
exhausted
each
favourite
topic
.
Another
meeting
will
suffice
to
*NL*
explain
his
sentiments
on
picturesque
beauty
,
and
second
marriages
,
and
*NL*
then
you
can
have
nothing
farther
to
ask
.
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elinor
,
''
cried
Marianne
,
``
is
this
fair
?
is
this
just
?
are
my
ideas
so
*NL*
scanty
?
But
I
see
what
you
mean
.
I
have
been
too
much
at
my
ease
,
too
*NL*
happy
,
too
frank
.
I
have
erred
against
every
common-place
notion
of
*NL*
decorum
;
I
have
been
open
and
sincere
where
I
ought
to
have
been
*NL*
reserved
,
spiritless
,
dull
,
and
deceitful
--
had
I
talked
only
of
the
*NL*
weather
and
the
roads
,
and
had
I
spoken
only
once
in
ten
minutes
,
this
*NL*
reproach
would
have
been
spared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
''
said
her
mother
,
``
you
must
not
be
offended
with
Elinor
--
she
*NL*
was
only
in
jest
.
I
should
scold
her
myself
,
if
she
were
capable
of
*NL*
wishing
to
check
the
delight
of
your
conversation
with
our
new
*NL*
friend
.
''
--
Marianne
was
softened
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Willoughby
,
on
his
side
,
gave
every
proof
of
his
pleasure
in
their
*NL*
acquaintance
,
which
an
evident
wish
of
improving
it
could
offer
.
He
*NL*
came
to
them
every
day
.
To
enquire
after
Marianne
was
at
first
his
*NL*
excuse
;
but
the
encouragement
of
his
reception
,
to
which
every
day
gave
*NL*
greater
kindness
,
made
such
an
excuse
unnecessary
before
it
had
ceased
*NL*
to
be
possible
,
by
Marianne
's
perfect
recovery
.
She
was
confined
for
*NL*
some
days
to
the
house
;
but
never
had
any
confinement
been
less
*NL*
irksome
.
Willoughby
was
a
young
man
of
good
abilities
,
quick
*NL*
imagination
,
lively
spirits
,
and
open
,
affectionate
manners
.
He
was
*NL*
exactly
formed
to
engage
Marianne
's
heart
,
for
with
all
this
,
he
joined
*NL*
not
only
a
captivating
person
,
but
a
natural
ardour
of
mind
which
was
*NL*
now
roused
and
increased
by
the
example
of
her
own
,
and
which
*NL*
recommended
him
to
her
affection
beyond
every
thing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
society
became
gradually
her
most
exquisite
enjoyment
.
They
read
,
*NL*
they
talked
,
they
sang
together
;
his
musical
talents
were
considerable
;
*NL*
and
he
read
with
all
the
sensibility
and
spirit
which
Edward
had
*NL*
unfortunately
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
estimation
he
was
as
faultless
as
in
Marianne
's
;
and
*NL*
Elinor
saw
nothing
to
censure
in
him
but
a
propensity
,
in
which
he
*NL*
strongly
resembled
and
peculiarly
delighted
her
sister
,
of
saying
too
*NL*
much
what
he
thought
on
every
occasion
,
without
attention
to
persons
or
*NL*
circumstances
.
In
hastily
forming
and
giving
his
opinion
of
other
*NL*
people
,
in
sacrificing
general
politeness
to
the
enjoyment
of
undivided
*NL*
attention
where
his
heart
was
engaged
,
and
in
slighting
too
easily
the
*NL*
forms
of
worldly
propriety
,
he
displayed
a
want
of
caution
which
Elinor
*NL*
could
not
approve
,
in
spite
of
all
that
he
and
Marianne
could
say
in
*NL*
its
support
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
began
now
to
perceive
that
the
desperation
which
had
seized
*NL*
her
at
sixteen
and
a
half
,
of
ever
seeing
a
man
who
could
satisfy
her
*NL*
ideas
of
perfection
,
had
been
rash
and
unjustifiable
.
Willoughby
was
*NL*
all
that
her
fancy
had
delineated
in
that
unhappy
hour
and
in
every
*NL*
brighter
period
,
as
capable
of
attaching
her
;
and
his
behaviour
*NL*
declared
his
wishes
to
be
in
that
respect
as
earnest
,
as
his
abilities
*NL*
were
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mother
too
,
in
whose
mind
not
one
speculative
thought
of
their
*NL*
marriage
had
been
raised
,
by
his
prospect
of
riches
,
was
led
before
the
*NL*
end
of
a
week
to
hope
and
expect
it
;
and
secretly
to
congratulate
*NL*
herself
on
having
gained
two
such
sons-in-law
as
Edward
and
Willoughby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
's
partiality
for
Marianne
,
which
had
so
early
been
*NL*
discovered
by
his
friends
,
now
first
became
perceptible
to
Elinor
,
when
*NL*
it
ceased
to
be
noticed
by
them
.
Their
attention
and
wit
were
drawn
*NL*
off
to
his
more
fortunate
rival
;
and
the
raillery
which
the
other
had
*NL*
incurred
before
any
partiality
arose
,
was
removed
when
his
feelings
*NL*
began
really
to
call
for
the
ridicule
so
justly
annexed
to
sensibility
.
*NL*
Elinor
was
obliged
,
though
unwillingly
,
to
believe
that
the
sentiments
*NL*
which
Mrs.
Jennings
had
assigned
him
for
her
own
satisfaction
,
were
now
*NL*
actually
excited
by
her
sister
;
and
that
however
a
general
resemblance
*NL*
of
disposition
between
the
parties
might
forward
the
affection
of
Mr.
*NL*
Willoughby
,
an
equally
striking
opposition
of
character
was
no
*NL*
hindrance
to
the
regard
of
Colonel
Brandon
.
She
saw
it
with
concern
;
*NL*
for
what
could
a
silent
man
of
five
and
thirty
hope
,
when
opposed
to
a
*NL*
very
lively
one
of
five
and
twenty
?
and
as
she
could
not
even
wish
him
*NL*
successful
,
she
heartily
wished
him
indifferent
.
She
liked
him
--
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
gravity
and
reserve
,
she
beheld
in
him
an
object
of
*NL*
interest
.
His
manners
,
though
serious
,
were
mild
;
and
his
reserve
*NL*
appeared
rather
the
result
of
some
oppression
of
spirits
than
of
any
*NL*
natural
gloominess
of
temper
.
Sir
John
had
dropped
hints
of
past
*NL*
injuries
and
disappointments
,
which
justified
her
belief
of
his
being
*NL*
an
unfortunate
man
,
and
she
regarded
him
with
respect
and
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
she
pitied
and
esteemed
him
the
more
because
he
was
slighted
by
*NL*
Willoughby
and
Marianne
,
who
,
prejudiced
against
him
for
being
neither
*NL*
lively
nor
young
,
seemed
resolved
to
undervalue
his
merits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brandon
is
just
the
kind
of
man
,
''
said
Willoughby
one
day
,
when
they
*NL*
were
talking
of
him
together
,
``
whom
every
body
speaks
well
of
,
and
*NL*
nobody
cares
about
;
whom
all
are
delighted
to
see
,
and
nobody
remembers
*NL*
to
talk
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
exactly
what
I
think
of
him
,
''
cried
Marianne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
boast
of
it
,
however
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
for
it
is
injustice
in
*NL*
both
of
you
.
He
is
highly
esteemed
by
all
the
family
at
the
park
,
and
*NL*
I
never
see
him
myself
without
taking
pains
to
converse
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
is
patronised
by
YOU
,
''
replied
Willoughby
,
``
is
certainly
in
*NL*
his
favour
;
but
as
for
the
esteem
of
the
others
,
it
is
a
reproach
in
*NL*
itself
.
Who
would
submit
to
the
indignity
of
being
approved
by
such
a
*NL*
woman
as
Lady
Middleton
and
Mrs.
Jennings
,
that
could
command
the
*NL*
indifference
of
any
body
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
the
abuse
of
such
people
as
yourself
and
Marianne
will
*NL*
make
amends
for
the
regard
of
Lady
Middleton
and
her
mother
.
If
their
*NL*
praise
is
censure
,
your
censure
may
be
praise
,
for
they
are
not
more
*NL*
undiscerning
,
than
you
are
prejudiced
and
unjust
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
defence
of
your
protege
you
can

be
saucy

My

you
call
him

me

Yes
,
Marianne
,
even
in
a
man
between
thirty
*NL*
and
forty
.
He
has
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
;
has
been
abroad
,
has

read
,
and
has
a
thinking

I
have
found
him
capable

giving
me

much
information
on
various
subjects
;

he
has
always
answered
my

inquiries
with
readiness
of
good-breeding
and
good
nature

*NL*
``
That
is
to
say

contemptuously

had
been
previously
informed

Willoughby

*NL*
``
I
may
venture

CHAPTER
11
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Little
had
Mrs.
Dashwood
or
her
daughters
imagined
when
they
first
came
*NL*
into
Devonshire
,
that
so
many
engagements
would
arise
to
occupy
their
*NL*
time
as
shortly
presented
themselves
,
or
that
they
should
have
such
*NL*
frequent
invitations
and
such
constant
visitors
as
to
leave
them
little
*NL*
leisure
for
serious
employment
.
Yet
such
was
the
case
.
When
Marianne
*NL*
was
recovered
,
the
schemes
of
amusement
at
home
and
abroad
,
which
Sir
*NL*
John
had
been
previously
forming
,
were
put
into
execution
.
The
private
*NL*
balls
at
the
park
then
began
;
and
parties
on
the
water
were
made
and
*NL*
accomplished
as
often
as
a
showery
October
would
allow
.
In
every
*NL*
meeting
of
the
kind
Willoughby
was
included
;
and
the
ease
and
*NL*
familiarity
which
naturally
attended
these
parties
were
exactly
*NL*
calculated
to
give
increasing
intimacy
to
his
acquaintance
with
the
*NL*
Dashwoods
,
to
afford
him
opportunity
of
witnessing
the
excellencies
of
*NL*
Marianne
,
of
marking
his
animated
admiration
of
her
,
and
of
receiving
,
*NL*
in
her
behaviour
to
himself
,
the
most
pointed
assurance
of
her
*NL*
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
not
be
surprised
at
their
attachment
.
She
only
wished
*NL*
that
it
were
less
openly
shewn
;
and
once
or
twice
did
venture
to
*NL*
suggest
the
propriety
of
some
self-command
to
Marianne
.
But
Marianne
*NL*
abhorred
all
concealment
where
no
real
disgrace
could
attend
unreserve
;
*NL*
and
to
aim
at
the
restraint
of
sentiments
which
were
not
in
themselves
*NL*
illaudable
,
appeared
to
her
not
merely
an
unnecessary
effort
,
but
a
*NL*
disgraceful
subjection
of
reason
to
common-place
and
mistaken
notions
.
*NL*
Willoughby
thought
the
same
;
and
their
behaviour
at
all
times
,
was
an
*NL*
illustration
of
their
opinions
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
present
she
had
no
eyes
for
any
one
else
.
Every
thing
he
*NL*
did
,
was
right
.
Every
thing
he
said
,
was
clever
.
If
their
evenings
at
*NL*
the
park
were
concluded
with
cards
,
he
cheated
himself
and
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
party
to
get
her
a
good
hand
.
If
dancing
formed
the
amusement
*NL*
of
the
night
,
they
were
partners
for
half
the
time
;
and
when
obliged
to
*NL*
separate
for
a
couple
of
dances
,
were
careful
to
stand
together
and
*NL*
scarcely
spoke
a
word
to
any
body
else
.
Such
conduct
made
them
of
*NL*
course
most
exceedingly
laughed
at
;
but
ridicule
could
not
shame
,
and
*NL*
seemed
hardly
to
provoke
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
entered
into
all
their
feelings
with
a
warmth
which
left
*NL*
her
no
inclination
for
checking
this
excessive
display
of
them
.
To
her
*NL*
it
was
but
the
natural
consequence
of
a
strong
affection
in
a
young
and
*NL*
ardent
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
season
of
happiness
to
Marianne
.
Her
heart
was
devoted
to
*NL*
Willoughby
,
and
the
fond
attachment
to
Norland
,
which
she
brought
with
*NL*
her
from
Sussex
,
was
more
likely
to
be
softened
than
she
had
thought
it
*NL*
possible
before
,
by
the
charms
which
his
society
bestowed
on
her
*NL*
present
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
happiness
was
not
so
great
.
Her
heart
was
not
so
much
at
*NL*
ease
,
nor
her
satisfaction
in
their
amusements
so
pure
.
They
afforded
*NL*
her
no
companion
that
could
make
amends
for
what
she
had
left
behind
,
*NL*
nor
that
could
teach
her
to
think
of
Norland
with
less
regret
than
*NL*
ever
.
Neither
Lady
Middleton
nor
Mrs.
Jennings
could
supply
to
her
the
*NL*
conversation
she
missed
;
although
the
latter
was
an
everlasting
talker
,
*NL*
and
from
the
first
had
regarded
her
with
a
kindness
which
ensured
her
a
*NL*
large
share
of
her
discourse
.
She
had
already
repeated
her
own
history
*NL*
to
Elinor
three
or
four
times
;
and
had
Elinor
's
memory
been
equal
to
*NL*
her
means
of
improvement
,
she
might
have
known
very
early
in
their
*NL*
acquaintance
all
the
particulars
of
Mr.
Jennings
's
last
illness
,
and
*NL*
what
he
said
to
his
wife
a
few
minutes
before
he
died
.
Lady
Middleton
*NL*
was
more
agreeable
than
her
mother
only
in
being
more
silent
.
Elinor
*NL*
needed
little
observation
to
perceive
that
her
reserve
was
a
mere
*NL*
calmness
of
manner
with
which
sense
had
nothing
to
do
.
Towards
her
*NL*
husband
and
mother
she
was
the
same
as
to
them
;
and
intimacy
was
*NL*
therefore
neither
to
be
looked
for
nor
desired
.
She
had
nothing
to
say
*NL*
one
day
that
she
had
not
said
the
day
before
.
Her
insipidity
was
*NL*
invariable
,
for
even
her
spirits
were
always
the
same
;
and
though
she
*NL*
did
not
oppose
the
parties
arranged
by
her
husband
,
provided
every
*NL*
thing
were
conducted
in
style
and
her
two
eldest
children
attended
her
,
*NL*
she
never
appeared
to
receive
more
enjoyment
from
them
than
she
might
*NL*
have
experienced
in
sitting
at
home
;
--
and
so
little
did
her
presence
*NL*
add
to
the
pleasure
of
the
others
,
by
any
share
in
their
conversation
,
*NL*
that
they
were
sometimes
only
reminded
of
her
being
amongst
them
by
her
*NL*
solicitude
about
her
troublesome
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Colonel
Brandon
alone
,
of
all
her
new
acquaintance
,
did
Elinor
find
*NL*
a
person
who
could
in
any
degree
claim
the
respect
of
abilities
,
excite
*NL*
the
interest
of
friendship
,
or
give
pleasure
as
a
companion
.
*NL*
Willoughby
was
out
of
the
question
.
Her
admiration
and
regard
,
even
*NL*
her
sisterly
regard
,
was
all
his
own
;
but
he
was
a
lover
;
his
*NL*
attentions
were
wholly
Marianne
's
,
and
a
far
less
agreeable
man
might
*NL*
have
been
more
generally
pleasing
.
Colonel
Brandon
,
unfortunately
for
*NL*
himself
,
had
no
such
encouragement
to
think
only
of
Marianne
,
and
in
*NL*
conversing
with
Elinor
he
found
the
greatest
consolation
for
the
*NL*
indifference
of
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
compassion
for
him
increased
,
as
she
had
reason
to
suspect
*NL*
that
the
misery
of
disappointed
love
had
already
been
known
to
him
.
*NL*
This
suspicion
was
given
by
some
words
which
accidentally
dropped
from
*NL*
him
one
evening
at
the
park
,
when
they
were
sitting
down
together
by
*NL*
mutual
consent
,
while
the
others
were
dancing
.
His
eyes
were
fixed
on
*NL*
Marianne
,
and
,
after
a
silence
of
some
minutes
,
he
said
,
with
a
faint
*NL*
smile
,
``
Your
sister
,
I
understand
,
does
not
approve
of
second
*NL*
attachments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
her
opinions
are
all
romantic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
rather
,
as
I
believe
,
she
considers
them
impossible
to
exist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
she
does
.
But
how
she
contrives
it
without
reflecting
on
*NL*
the
character
of
her
own
father
,
who
had
himself
two
wives
,
I
know
not
.
*NL*
A
few
years
however
will
settle
her
opinions
on
the
reasonable
basis
of
*NL*
common
sense
and
observation
;
and
then
they
may
be
more
easy
to
define
*NL*
and
to
justify
than
they
now
are
,
by
any
body
but
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
probably
be
the
case
,
''
he
replied
;
``
and
yet
there
is
*NL*
something
so
amiable
in
the
prejudices
of
a
young
mind
,
that
one
is
*NL*
sorry
to
see
them
give
way
to
the
reception
of
more
general
opinions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
agree
with
you
there
,
''
said
Elinor
.
``
There
are
*NL*
inconveniences
attending
such
feelings
as
Marianne
's
,
which
all
the
*NL*
charms
of
enthusiasm
and
ignorance
of
the
world
can
not
atone
for
.
Her
*NL*
systems
have
all
the
unfortunate
tendency
of
setting
propriety
at
*NL*
nought
;
and
a
better
acquaintance
with
the
world
is
what
I
look
forward
*NL*
to
as
her
greatest
possible
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
pause
he
resumed
the
conversation
by
saying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
your
sister
make
no
distinction
in
her
objections
against
a
*NL*
second
attachment
?
or
is
it
equally
criminal
in
every
body
?
Are
those
*NL*
who
have
been
disappointed
in
their
first
choice
,
whether
from
the
*NL*
inconstancy
of
its
object
,
or
the
perverseness
of
circumstances
,
to
be
*NL*
equally
indifferent
during
the
rest
of
their
lives
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
I
am
not
acquainted
with
the
minutiae
of
her
principles
.
*NL*
I
only
know
that
I
never
yet
heard
her
admit
any
instance
of
a
second
*NL*
attachment
's
being
pardonable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
he
,
``
can
not
hold
;
but
a
change
,
a
total
change
of
*NL*
sentiments
--
No
,
no
,
do
not
desire
it
;
for
when
the
romantic
refinements
*NL*
of
a
young
mind
are
obliged
to
give
way
,
how
frequently
are
they
*NL*
succeeded
by
such
opinions
as
are
but
too
common
,
and
too
dangerous
!
I
*NL*
speak
from
experience
.
I
once
knew
a
lady
who
in
temper
and
mind
*NL*
greatly
resembled
your
sister
,
who
thought
and
judged
like
her
,
but
who
*NL*
from
an
inforced
change
--
from
a
series
of
unfortunate
circumstances
''
--
*NL*
Here
he
stopt
suddenly
;
appeared
to
think
that
he
had
said
too
much
,
*NL*
and
by
his
countenance
gave
rise
to
conjectures
,
which
might
not
*NL*
otherwise
have
entered
Elinor
's
head
.
The
lady
would
probably
have
*NL*
passed
without
suspicion
,
had
he
not
convinced
Miss
Dashwood
that
what
*NL*
concerned
her
ought
not
to
escape
his
lips
.
As
it
was
,
it
required
but
*NL*
a
slight
effort
of
fancy
to
connect
his
emotion
with
the
tender
*NL*
recollection
of
past
regard
.
Elinor
attempted
no
more
.
But
Marianne
,
*NL*
in
her
place
,
would
not
have
done
so
little
.
The
whole
story
would
*NL*
have
been
speedily
formed
under
her
active
imagination
;
and
every
thing
*NL*
established
in
the
most
melancholy
order
of
disastrous
love
.

CHAPTER
12
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
Elinor
and
Marianne
were
walking
together
the
next
morning
the
*NL*
latter
communicated
a
piece
of
news
to
her
sister
,
which
in
spite
of
*NL*
all
that
she
knew
before
of
Marianne
's
imprudence
and
want
of
thought
,
*NL*
surprised
her
by
its
extravagant
testimony
of
both
.
Marianne
told
her
,
*NL*
with
the
greatest
delight
,
that
Willoughby
had
given
her
a
horse
,
one
*NL*
that
he
had
bred
himself
on
his
estate
in
Somersetshire
,
and
which
was
*NL*
exactly
calculated
to
carry
a
woman
.
Without
considering
that
it
was
*NL*
not
in
her
mother
's
plan
to
keep
any
horse
,
that
if
she
were
to
alter
*NL*
her
resolution
in
favour
of
this
gift
,
she
must
buy
another
for
the
*NL*
servant
,
and
keep
a
servant
to
ride
it
,
and
after
all
,
build
a
stable
*NL*
to
receive
them
,
she
had
accepted
the
present
without
hesitation
,
and
*NL*
told
her
sister
of
it
in
raptures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
intends
to
send
his
groom
into
Somersetshire
immediately
for
it
,
''
*NL*
she
added
,
``
and
when
it
arrives
we
will
ride
every
day
.
You
shall
*NL*
share
its
use
with
me
.
Imagine
to
yourself
,
my
dear
Elinor
,
the
*NL*
delight
of
a
gallop
on
some
of
these
downs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Most
unwilling
was
she
to
awaken
from
such
a
dream
of
felicity
to
*NL*
comprehend
all
the
unhappy
truths
which
attended
the
affair
;
and
for
*NL*
some
time
she
refused
to
submit
to
them
.
As
to
an
additional
servant
,
*NL*
the
expense
would
be
a
trifle
;
Mama
she
was
sure
would
never
object
to
*NL*
it
;
and
any
horse
would
do
for
HIM
;
he
might
always
get
one
at
the
*NL*
park
;
as
to
a
stable
,
the
merest
shed
would
be
sufficient
.
Elinor
then
*NL*
ventured
to
doubt
the
propriety
of
her
receiving
such
a
present
from
a
*NL*
man
so
little
,
or
at
least
so
lately
known
to
her
.
This
was
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
Elinor
,
''
said
she
warmly
,
``
in
supposing
I
know
very
*NL*
little
of
Willoughby
.
I
have
not
known
him
long
indeed
,
but
I
am
much
*NL*
better
acquainted
with
him
,
than
I
am
with
any
other
creature
in
the
*NL*
world
,
except
yourself
and
mama
.
It
is
not
time
or
opportunity
that
is
*NL*
to
determine
intimacy
;
--
it
is
disposition
alone
.
Seven
years
would
be
*NL*
insufficient
to
make
some
people
acquainted
with
each
other
,
and
seven
*NL*
days
are
more
than
enough
for
others
.
I
should
hold
myself
guilty
of
*NL*
greater
impropriety
in
accepting
a
horse
from
my
brother
,
than
from
*NL*
Willoughby
.
Of
John
I
know
very
little
,
though
we
have
lived
together
*NL*
for
years
;
but
of
Willoughby
my
judgment
has
long
been
formed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
thought
it
wisest
to
touch
that
point
no
more
.
She
knew
her
*NL*
sister
's
temper
.
Opposition
on
so
tender
a
subject
would
only
attach
*NL*
her
the
more
to
her
own
opinion
.
But
by
an
appeal
to
her
affection
for
*NL*
her
mother
,
by
representing
the
inconveniences
which
that
indulgent
*NL*
mother
must
draw
on
herself
,
if
-LRB-
as
would
probably
be
the
case
-RRB-
she
*NL*
consented
to
this
increase
of
establishment
,
Marianne
was
shortly
*NL*
subdued
;
and
she
promised
not
to
tempt
her
mother
to
such
imprudent
*NL*
kindness
by
mentioning
the
offer
,
and
to
tell
Willoughby
when
she
saw
*NL*
him
next
,
that
it
must
be
declined
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
faithful
to
her
word
;
and
when
Willoughby
called
at
the
*NL*
cottage
,
the
same
day
,
Elinor
heard
her
express
her
disappointment
to
*NL*
him
in
a
low
voice
,
on
being
obliged
to
forego
the
acceptance
of
his
*NL*
present
.
The
reasons
for
this
alteration
were
at
the
same
time
*NL*
related
,
and
they
were
such
as
to
make
further
entreaty
on
his
side
*NL*
impossible
.
His
concern
however
was
very
apparent
;
and
after
*NL*
expressing
it
with
earnestness
,
he
added
,
in
the
same
low
voice
,
--
``
But
,
*NL*
Marianne
,
the
horse
is
still
yours
,
though
you
can
not
use
it
now
.
I
*NL*
shall
keep
it
only
till
you
can
claim
it
.
When
you
leave
Barton
to
*NL*
form
your
own
establishment
in
a
more
lasting
home
,
Queen
Mab
shall
*NL*
receive
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
overheard
by
Miss
Dashwood
;
and
in
the
whole
of
the
*NL*
sentence
,
in
his
manner
of
pronouncing
it
,
and
in
his
addressing
her
*NL*
sister
by
her
Christian
name
alone
,
she
instantly
saw
an
intimacy
so
*NL*
decided
,
a
meaning
so
direct
,
as
marked
a
perfect
agreement
between
*NL*
them
.
From
that
moment
she
doubted
not
of
their
being
engaged
to
each
*NL*
other
;
and
the
belief
of
it
created
no
other
surprise
than
that
she
,
or
*NL*
any
of
their
friends
,
should
be
left
by
tempers
so
frank
,
to
discover
*NL*
it
by
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
related
something
to
her
the
next
day
,
which
placed
this
*NL*
matter
in
a
still
clearer
light
.
Willoughby
had
spent
the
preceding
*NL*
evening
with
them
,
and
Margaret
,
by
being
left
some
time
in
the
parlour
*NL*
with
only
him
and
Marianne
,
had
had
opportunity
for
observations
,
*NL*
which
,
with
a
most
important
face
,
she
communicated
to
her
eldest
*NL*
sister
,
when
they
were
next
by
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Elinor
!
''
she
cried
,
``
I
have
such
a
secret
to
tell
you
about
*NL*
Marianne
.
I
am
sure
she
will
be
married
to
Mr.
Willoughby
very
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
said
so
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
almost
every
day
since
they
first
*NL*
met
on
High-church
Down
;
and
they
had
not
known
each
other
a
week
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
before
you
were
certain
that
Marianne
wore
his
picture
round
*NL*
her
neck
;
but
it
turned
out
to
be
only
the
miniature
of
our
great
*NL*
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
indeed
this
is
quite
another
thing
.
I
am
sure
they
will
be
*NL*
married
very
soon
,
for
he
has
got
a
lock
of
her
hair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
,
Margaret
.
It
may
be
only
the
hair
of
some
great
uncle
of
*NL*
HIS
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
indeed
,
Elinor
,
it
is
Marianne
's
.
I
am
almost
sure
it
is
,
for
I
*NL*
saw
him
cut
it
off
.
Last
night
after
tea
,
when
you
and
mama
went
out
*NL*
of
the
room
,
they
were
whispering
and
talking
together
as
fast
as
could
*NL*
be
,
and
he
seemed
to
be
begging
something
of
her
,
and
presently
he
took
*NL*
up
her
scissors
and
cut
off
a
long
lock
of
her
hair
,
for
it
was
all
*NL*
tumbled
down
her
back
;
and
he
kissed
it
,
and
folded
it
up
in
a
piece
of
*NL*
white
paper
;
and
put
it
into
his
pocket-book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
such
particulars
,
stated
on
such
authority
,
Elinor
could
not
*NL*
withhold
her
credit
;
nor
was
she
disposed
to
it
,
for
the
circumstance
*NL*
was
in
perfect
unison
with
what
she
had
heard
and
seen
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
's
sagacity
was
not
always
displayed
in
a
way
so
satisfactory
*NL*
to
her
sister
.
When
Mrs.
Jennings
attacked
her
one
evening
at
the
*NL*
park
,
to
give
the
name
of
the
young
man
who
was
Elinor
's
particular
*NL*
favourite
,
which
had
been
long
a
matter
of
great
curiosity
to
her
,
*NL*
Margaret
answered
by
looking
at
her
sister
,
and
saying
,
``
I
must
not
*NL*
tell
,
may
I
,
Elinor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
of
course
made
every
body
laugh
;
and
Elinor
tried
to
laugh
too
.
*NL*
But
the
effort
was
painful
.
She
was
convinced
that
Margaret
had
fixed
*NL*
on
a
person
whose
name
she
could
not
bear
with
composure
to
become
a
*NL*
standing
joke
with
Mrs.
Jennings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
felt
for
her
most
sincerely
;
but
she
did
more
harm
than
good
*NL*
to
the
cause
,
by
turning
very
red
and
saying
in
an
angry
manner
to
*NL*
Margaret
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
that
whatever
your
conjectures
may
be
,
you
have
no
right
to
*NL*
repeat
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
had
any
conjectures
about
it
,
''
replied
Margaret
;
``
it
was
you
*NL*
who
told
me
of
it
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
increased
the
mirth
of
the
company
,
and
Margaret
was
eagerly
*NL*
pressed
to
say
something
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
pray
,
Miss
Margaret
,
let
us
know
all
about
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
.
``
What
is
the
gentleman
's
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
not
tell
,
ma'am
.
But
I
know
very
well
what
it
is
;
and
I
know
*NL*
where
he
is
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
we
can
guess
where
he
is
;
at
his
own
house
at
Norland
to
be
*NL*
sure
.
He
is
the
curate
of
the
parish
I
dare
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
THAT
he
is
not
.
He
is
of
no
profession
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Margaret
,
''
said
Marianne
with
great
warmth
,
``
you
know
that
all
this
is
*NL*
an
invention
of
your
own
,
and
that
there
is
no
such
person
in
*NL*
existence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
he
is
lately
dead
,
Marianne
,
for
I
am
sure
there
was
such
*NL*
a
man
once
,
and
his
name
begins
with
an
F.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Most
grateful
did
Elinor
feel
to
Lady
Middleton
for
observing
,
at
this
*NL*
moment
,
``
that
it
rained
very
hard
,
''
though
she
believed
the
*NL*
interruption
to
proceed
less
from
any
attention
to
her
,
than
from
her
*NL*
ladyship
's
great
dislike
of
all
such
inelegant
subjects
of
raillery
as
*NL*
delighted
her
husband
and
mother
.
The
idea
however
started
by
her
,
was
*NL*
immediately
pursued
by
Colonel
Brandon
,
who
was
on
every
occasion
*NL*
mindful
of
the
feelings
of
others
;
and
much
was
said
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
rain
by
both
of
them
.
Willoughby
opened
the
piano-forte
,
and
asked
*NL*
Marianne
to
sit
down
to
it
;
and
thus
amidst
the
various
endeavours
of
*NL*
different
people
to
quit
the
topic
,
it
fell
to
the
ground
.
But
not
so
*NL*
easily
did
Elinor
recover
from
the
alarm
into
which
it
had
thrown
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
party
was
formed
this
evening
for
going
on
the
following
day
to
see
a
*NL*
very
fine
place
about
twelve
miles
from
Barton
,
belonging
to
a
*NL*
brother-in-law
of
Colonel
Brandon
,
without
whose
interest
it
could
not
*NL*
be
seen
,
as
the
proprietor
,
who
was
then
abroad
,
had
left
strict
orders
*NL*
on
that
head
.
The
grounds
were
declared
to
be
highly
beautiful
,
and
*NL*
Sir
John
,
who
was
particularly
warm
in
their
praise
,
might
be
allowed
*NL*
to
be
a
tolerable
judge
,
for
he
had
formed
parties
to
visit
them
,
at
*NL*
least
,
twice
every
summer
for
the
last
ten
years
.
They
contained
a
*NL*
noble
piece
of
water
;
a
sail
on
which
was
to
a
form
a
great
part
of
the
*NL*
morning
's
amusement
;
cold
provisions
were
to
be
taken
,
open
carriages
*NL*
only
to
be
employed
,
and
every
thing
conducted
in
the
usual
style
of
a
*NL*
complete
party
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
some
few
of
the
company
it
appeared
rather
a
bold
undertaking
,
*NL*
considering
the
time
of
year
,
and
that
it
had
rained
every
day
for
the
*NL*
last
fortnight
;
--
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
who
had
already
a
cold
,
was
*NL*
persuaded
by
Elinor
to
stay
at
home
.

CHAPTER
13
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Their
intended
excursion
to
Whitwell
turned
out
very
different
from
*NL*
what
Elinor
had
expected
.
She
was
prepared
to
be
wet
through
,
*NL*
fatigued
,
and
frightened
;
but
the
event
was
still
more
unfortunate
,
for
*NL*
they
did
not
go
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
ten
o'clock
the
whole
party
was
assembled
at
the
park
,
where
they
*NL*
were
to
breakfast
.
The
morning
was
rather
favourable
,
though
it
had
*NL*
rained
all
night
,
as
the
clouds
were
then
dispersing
across
the
sky
,
*NL*
and
the
sun
frequently
appeared
.
They
were
all
in
high
spirits
and
*NL*
good
humour
,
eager
to
be
happy
,
and
determined
to
submit
to
the
*NL*
greatest
inconveniences
and
hardships
rather
than
be
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
at
breakfast
the
letters
were
brought
in
.
Among
the
*NL*
rest
there
was
one
for
Colonel
Brandon
;
--
he
took
it
,
looked
at
the
*NL*
direction
,
changed
colour
,
and
immediately
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
Brandon
?
''
said
Sir
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
could
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
he
has
had
no
bad
news
,
''
said
Lady
Middleton
.
``
It
must
be
*NL*
something
extraordinary
that
could
make
Colonel
Brandon
leave
my
*NL*
breakfast
table
so
suddenly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
five
minutes
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
bad
news
,
Colonel
,
I
hope
;
''
said
Mrs.
Jennings
,
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
at
all
,
ma'am
,
I
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
from
Avignon
?
I
hope
it
is
not
to
say
that
your
sister
is
*NL*
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
.
It
came
from
town
,
and
is
merely
a
letter
of
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
came
the
hand
to
discompose
you
so
much
,
if
it
was
only
a
*NL*
letter
of
business
?
Come
,
come
,
this
wo
n't
do
,
Colonel
;
so
let
us
hear
*NL*
the
truth
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
madam
,
''
said
Lady
Middleton
,
``
recollect
what
you
are
saying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
is
to
tell
you
that
your
cousin
Fanny
is
married
?
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
,
without
attending
to
her
daughter
's
reproof
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
it
is
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
know
who
it
is
from
,
Colonel
.
And
I
hope
she
is
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
mean
,
ma'am
?
''
said
he
,
colouring
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
you
know
who
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
particularly
sorry
,
ma'am
,
''
said
he
,
addressing
Lady
Middleton
,
*NL*
``
that
I
should
receive
this
letter
today
,
for
it
is
on
business
which
*NL*
requires
my
immediate
attendance
in
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
town
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Jennings
.
``
What
can
you
have
to
do
in
town
at
*NL*
this
time
of
year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
own
loss
is
great
,
''
he
continued
,
``
in
being
obliged
to
leave
so
*NL*
agreeable
a
party
;
but
I
am
the
more
concerned
,
as
I
fear
my
presence
*NL*
is
necessary
to
gain
your
admittance
at
Whitwell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
blow
upon
them
all
was
this
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
write
a
note
to
the
housekeeper
,
Mr.
Brandon
,
''
said
*NL*
Marianne
,
eagerly
,
``
will
it
not
be
sufficient
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
go
,
''
said
Sir
John
.
--
``
It
shall
not
be
put
off
when
we
are
so
*NL*
near
it

You
can
not
go
to
town
till
tomorrow
,
Brandon
,
that
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
it
could
be
so
easily
settled

But
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
*NL*
delay
my
journey
for
one
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
but
let
us
know
what
your
business
is
,

said
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
,
``
we
might
see
whether
it
could
be
put
off

not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
not
be
six
hours
later

said
Willoughby
,
``
if
you
were
to
*NL*
defer
your
journey
till
our
return

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
afford
to
lose
ONE
hour
.
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
then
heard
Willoughby
say
,
in
a
low
voice
to
Marianne
,
``
There
*NL*
are
some
people
who
can
not
bear
a
party
of
pleasure

Brandon
is
one
of
*NL*
them
.
He
was
afraid
of
catching
cold
I
dare
say
,
and
invented
this
*NL*
trick
for
getting
out
of
it
.
I
would
lay
fifty
guineas
the
letter
was
*NL*
of
his
own
writing

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
of
it

replied
Marianne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
persuading
you
to
change
your
mind

I
know
of

old

said
Sir
John
,
``
when
once
you
are
determined
on
anything

But

*NL*
however

I
hope
you
will
think
better

Consider

here
are
the
*NL*
two
Miss
Careys
come
over
from
Newton

the
three
Miss
Dashwoods
walked
*NL*
up
from

cottage

Mr.
Willoughby
got
up
two
hours
before
his
*NL*
usual
time
,
on
purpose
to
go
to
Whitwell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
again
repeated
his
sorrow
at
being
the
cause
of
*NL*
disappointing
the
party
;
but
at
the
same
time
declared
it
to
be
*NL*
unavoidable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
when
will
you
come
back
again
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
we
shall
see
you
at
Barton

added
her
ladyship

``
as
soon

you
can
conveniently

``
Ay

Mrs.

then
perhaps
you
may

find
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not

ashamed

Colonel

horses
were
announced

*NL*
``

Sir

Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you

He
then
took

he
merely
bowed

said
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
He
wished
her
a
good
morning
,
and
,
attended
by
Sir
John
,
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
complaints

lamentations
which
politeness
had
hitherto
*NL*
restrained
,
now
burst
forth
universally
;

they
all
agreed
again

*NL*
again
how
provoking
it
was
to
be
so
disappointed

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
guess
what
his

said
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
exultingly
.

*NL*
``
Can
you

said
almost
every

*NL*
``
Yes

about

.
We
will
not
say
how
near
,
for
fear
of
shocking
the
*NL*
young
ladies
.
''
Then
,
lowering
her
voice
a
little
,
she
said
to
Elinor
,
*NL*
``
She
is
his
natural
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
and
as
like
him
as
she
can
stare
.
I
dare
say
the
Colonel
*NL*
will
leave
her
all
his
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Sir
John
returned
,
he
joined
most
heartily
in
the
general
regret
*NL*
on
so
unfortunate
an
event
;
concluding
however
by
observing
,
that
as
*NL*
they
were
all
got
together
,
they
must
do
something
by
way
of
being
*NL*
happy
;
and
after
some
consultation
it
was
agreed
,
that
although
*NL*
happiness
could
only
be
enjoyed
at
Whitwell
,
they
might
procure
a
*NL*
tolerable
composure
of
mind
by
driving
about
the
country
.
The
*NL*
carriages
were
then
ordered
;
Willoughby
's
was
first
,
and
Marianne
never
*NL*
looked
happier
than
when
she
got
into
it
.
He
drove
through
the
park
*NL*
very
fast
,
and
they
were
soon
out
of
sight
;
and
nothing
more
of
them
*NL*
was
seen
till
their
return
,
which
did
not
happen
till
after
the
return
*NL*
of
all
the
rest
.
They
both
seemed
delighted
with
their
drive
;
but
said
*NL*
only
in
general
terms
that
they
had
kept
in
the
lanes
,
while
the
others
*NL*
went
on
the
downs
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
settled
that
there
should
be
a
dance
in
the
evening
,
and
that
*NL*
every
body
should
be
extremely
merry
all
day
long
.
Some
more
of
the
*NL*
Careys
came
to
dinner
,
and
they
had
the
pleasure
of
sitting
down
nearly
*NL*
twenty
to
table
,
which
Sir
John
observed
with
great
contentment
.
*NL*
Willoughby
took
his
usual
place
between
the
two
elder
Miss
Dashwoods
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
sat
on
Elinor
's
right
hand
;
and
they
had
not
been
long
*NL*
seated
,
before
she
leant
behind
her
and
Willoughby
,
and
said
to
*NL*
Marianne
,
loud
enough
for
them
both
to
hear
,
``
I
have
found
you
out
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
your
tricks
.
I
know
where
you
spent
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
coloured
,
and
replied
very
hastily
,
``
Where
,
pray
?
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
not
you
know
,
''
said
Willoughby
,
``
that
we
had
been
out
in
my
*NL*
curricle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
Mr.
Impudence
,
I
know
that
very
well
,
and
I
was
determined
*NL*
to
find
out
WHERE
you
had
been
to
.
--
I
hope
you
like
your
house
,
Miss
*NL*
Marianne
.
It
is
a
very
large
one
,
I
know
;
and
when
I
come
to
see
you
,
*NL*
I
hope
you
will
have
new-furnished
it
,
for
it
wanted
it
very
much
when
*NL*
I
was
there
six
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
turned
away
in
great
confusion
.
Mrs.
Jennings
laughed
*NL*
heartily
;
and
Elinor
found
that
in
her
resolution
to
know
where
they
*NL*
had
been
,
she
had
actually
made
her
own
woman
enquire
of
Mr.
*NL*
Willoughby
's
groom
;
and
that
she
had
by
that
method
been
informed
that
*NL*
they
had
gone
to
Allenham
,
and
spent
a
considerable
time
there
in
*NL*
walking
about
the
garden
and
going
all
over
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
hardly
believe
this
to
be
true
,
as
it
seemed
very
unlikely
*NL*
that
Willoughby
should
propose
,
or
Marianne
consent
,
to
enter
the
house
*NL*
while
Mrs.
Smith
was
in
it
,
with
whom
Marianne
had
not
the
smallest
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
left
the
dining-room
,
Elinor
enquired
of
her
about
it
;
*NL*
and
great
was
her
surprise
when
she
found
that
every
circumstance
*NL*
related
by
Mrs.
Jennings
was
perfectly
true
.
Marianne
was
quite
angry
*NL*
with
her
for
doubting
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
imagine
,
Elinor
,
that
we
did
not
go
there
,
or
that
we
*NL*
did
not
see
the
house
?
Is
not
it
what
you
have
often
wished
to
do
*NL*
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Marianne
,
but
I
would
not
go
while
Mrs.
Smith
was
there
,
and
with
*NL*
no
other
companion
than
Mr.
Willoughby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Willoughby
however
is
the
only
person
who
can
have
a
right
to
shew
*NL*
that
house
;
and
as
he
went
in
an
open
carriage
,
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
have
any
other
companion
.
I
never
spent
a
pleasanter
morning
in
my
*NL*
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
that
the
pleasantness
of
an
employment
*NL*
does
not
always
evince
its
propriety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
nothing
can
be
a
stronger
proof
of
it
,
Elinor
;
for
if
*NL*
there
had
been
any
real
impropriety
in
what
I
did
,
I
should
have
been
*NL*
sensible
of
it
at
the
time
,
for
we
always
know
when
we
are
acting
*NL*
wrong
,
and
with
such
a
conviction
I
could
have
had
no
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
Marianne
,
as
it
has
already
exposed
you
to
some
very
*NL*
impertinent
remarks
,
do
you
not
now
begin
to
doubt
the
discretion
of
*NL*
your
own
conduct
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
impertinent
remarks
of
Mrs.
Jennings
are
to
be
the
proof
of
*NL*
impropriety
in
conduct
,
we
are
all
offending
every
moment
of
our
lives
.
*NL*
I
value
not
her
censure
any
more
than
I
should
do
her
commendation
.
I
*NL*
am
not
sensible
of
having
done
anything
wrong
in
walking
over
Mrs.
*NL*
Smith
's
grounds
,
or
in
seeing
her
house
.
They
will
one
day
be
Mr.
*NL*
Willoughby
's
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
were
one
day
to
be
your
own
,
Marianne
,
you
would
not
be
*NL*
justified
in
what
you
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
blushed
at
this
hint
;
but
it
was
even
visibly
gratifying
to
her
;
*NL*
and
after
a
ten
minutes
'
interval
of
earnest
thought
,
she
came
to
her
*NL*
sister
again
,
and
said
with
great
good
humour
,
``
Perhaps
,
Elinor
,
it
WAS
*NL*
rather
ill-judged
in
me
to
go
to
Allenham
;
but
Mr.
Willoughby
wanted
*NL*
particularly
to
shew
me
the
place
;
and
it
is
a
charming
house
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
.
--
There
is
one
remarkably
pretty
sitting
room
up
stairs
;
of
a
nice
*NL*
comfortable
size
for
constant
use
,
and
with
modern
furniture
it
would
*NL*
be
delightful
.
It
is
a
corner
room
,
and
has
windows
on
two
sides
.
On
*NL*
one
side
you
look
across
the
bowling-green
,
behind
the
house
,
to
a
*NL*
beautiful
hanging
wood
,
and
on
the
other
you
have
a
view
of
the
church
*NL*
and
village
,
and
,
beyond
them
,
of
those
fine
bold
hills
that
we
have
so
*NL*
often
admired
.
I
did
not
see
it
to
advantage
,
for
nothing
could
be
*NL*
more
forlorn
than
the
furniture
,
--
but
if
it
were
newly
fitted
up
--
a
*NL*
couple
of
hundred
pounds
,
Willoughby
says
,
would
make
it
one
of
the
*NL*
pleasantest
summer-rooms
in
England
.

*NL*
*NL*
Could
Elinor
have
listened
to
her
without
interruption
from
the
others
,
*NL*
she
would
have
described
every
room
in
the
house
with
equal
delight

CHAPTER
14
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
sudden
termination
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
visit
at
the
park
,
with
his
*NL*
steadiness
in
concealing
its
cause
,
filled
the
mind
,
and
raised
the
*NL*
wonder
of
Mrs.
Jennings
for
two
or
three
days
;
she
was
a
great
*NL*
wonderer
,
as
every
one
must
be
who
takes
a
very
lively
interest
in
all
*NL*
the
comings
and
goings
of
all
their
acquaintance
.
She
wondered
,
with
*NL*
little
intermission
what
could
be
the
reason
of
it
;
was
sure
there
must
*NL*
be
some
bad
news
,
and
thought
over
every
kind
of
distress
that
could
*NL*
have
befallen
him
,
with
a
fixed
determination
that
he
should
not
escape
*NL*
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
very
melancholy
must
be
the
matter
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
``
I
could
see
it
in
his
face
.
Poor
man
!
I
am
afraid
his
circumstances
*NL*
may
be
bad
.
The
estate
at
Delaford
was
never
reckoned
more
than
two
*NL*
thousand
a
year
,
and
his
brother
left
everything
sadly
involved
.
I
do
*NL*
think
he
must
have
been
sent
for
about
money
matters
,
for
what
else
can
*NL*
it
be
?
I
wonder
whether
it
is
so
.
I
would
give
anything
to
know
the
*NL*
truth
of
it
.
Perhaps
it
is
about
Miss
Williams
and
,
by
the
bye
,
I
dare
*NL*
say
it
is
,
because
he
looked
so
conscious
when
I
mentioned
her
.
May
be
*NL*
she
is
ill
in
town
;
nothing
in
the
world
more
likely
,
for
I
have
a
*NL*
notion
she
is
always
rather
sickly
.
I
would
lay
any
wager
it
is
about
*NL*
Miss
Williams
.
It
is
not
so
very
likely
he
should
be
distressed
in
his
*NL*
circumstances
NOW
,
for
he
is
a
very
prudent
man
,
and
to
be
sure
must
*NL*
have
cleared
the
estate
by
this
time
.
I
wonder
what
it
can
be
!
May
be
*NL*
his
sister
is
worse
at
Avignon
,
and
has
sent
for
him
over
.
His
setting
*NL*
off
in
such
a
hurry
seems
very
like
it
.
Well
,
I
wish
him
out
of
all
*NL*
his
trouble
with
all
my
heart
,
and
a
good
wife
into
the
bargain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
wondered
,
so
talked
Mrs.
Jennings
.
Her
opinion
varying
with
every
*NL*
fresh
conjecture
,
and
all
seeming
equally
probable
as
they
arose
.
*NL*
Elinor
,
though
she
felt
really
interested
in
the
welfare
of
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
,
could
not
bestow
all
the
wonder
on
his
going
so
suddenly
away
,
*NL*
which
Mrs.
Jennings
was
desirous
of
her
feeling
;
for
besides
that
the
*NL*
circumstance
did
not
in
her
opinion
justify
such
lasting
amazement
or
*NL*
variety
of
speculation
,
her
wonder
was
otherwise
disposed
of
.
It
was
*NL*
engrossed
by
the
extraordinary
silence
of
her
sister
and
Willoughby
on
*NL*
the
subject
,
which
they
must
know
to
be
peculiarly
interesting
to
them
*NL*
all
.
As
this
silence
continued
,
every
day
made
it
appear
more
strange
*NL*
and
more
incompatible
with
the
disposition
of
both
.
Why
they
should
*NL*
not
openly
acknowledge
to
her
mother
and
herself
,
what
their
constant
*NL*
behaviour
to
each
other
declared
to
have
taken
place
,
Elinor
could
not
*NL*
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
easily
conceive
that
marriage
might
not
be
immediately
in
*NL*
their
power
;
for
though
Willoughby
was
independent
,
there
was
no
reason
*NL*
to
believe
him
rich
.
His
estate
had
been
rated
by
Sir
John
at
about
*NL*
six
or
seven
hundred
a
year
;
but
he
lived
at
an
expense
to
which
that
*NL*
income
could
hardly
be
equal
,
and
he
had
himself
often
complained
of
*NL*
his
poverty
.
But
for
this
strange
kind
of
secrecy
maintained
by
them
*NL*
relative
to
their
engagement
,
which
in
fact
concealed
nothing
at
all
,
*NL*
she
could
not
account
;
and
it
was
so
wholly
contradictory
to
their
*NL*
general
opinions
and
practice
,
that
a
doubt
sometimes
entered
her
mind
*NL*
of
their
being
really
engaged
,
and
this
doubt
was
enough
to
prevent
her
*NL*
making
any
inquiry
of
Marianne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
more
expressive
of
attachment
to
them
all
,
than
*NL*
Willoughby
's
behaviour
.
To
Marianne
it
had
all
the
distinguishing
*NL*
tenderness
which
a
lover
's
heart
could
give
,
and
to
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
family
it
was
the
affectionate
attention
of
a
son
and
a
brother
.
The
*NL*
cottage
seemed
to
be
considered
and
loved
by
him
as
his
home
;
many
more
*NL*
of
his
hours
were
spent
there
than
at
Allenham
;
and
if
no
general
*NL*
engagement
collected
them
at
the
park
,
the
exercise
which
called
him
*NL*
out
in
the
morning
was
almost
certain
of
ending
there
,
where
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
day
was
spent
by
himself
at
the
side
of
Marianne
,
and
by
his
*NL*
favourite
pointer
at
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
in
particular
,
about
a
week
after
Colonel
Brandon
left
the
*NL*
country
,
his
heart
seemed
more
than
usually
open
to
every
feeling
of
*NL*
attachment
to
the
objects
around
him
;
and
on
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
happening
*NL*
to
mention
her
design
of
improving
the
cottage
in
the
spring
,
he
warmly
*NL*
opposed
every
alteration
of
a
place
which
affection
had
established
as
*NL*
perfect
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
he
exclaimed
--
``
Improve
this
dear
cottage
!
No
.
THAT
I
will
*NL*
never
consent
to
.
Not
a
stone
must
be
added
to
its
walls
,
not
an
inch
*NL*
to
its
size
,
if
my
feelings
are
regarded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
alarmed
,
''
said
Miss
Dashwood
,
``
nothing
of
the
kind
will
be
*NL*
done
;
for
my
mother
will
never
have
money
enough
to
attempt
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
heartily
glad
of
it
,
''
he
cried
.
``
May
she
always
be
poor
,
if
she
*NL*
can
employ
her
riches
no
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Willoughby
.
But
you
may
be
assured
that
I
would
not
*NL*
sacrifice
one
sentiment
of
local
attachment
of
yours
,
or
of
any
one
*NL*
whom
I
loved
,
for
all
the
improvements
in
the
world
.
Depend
upon
it
*NL*
that
whatever
unemployed
sum
may
remain
,
when
I
make
up
my
accounts
in
*NL*
the
spring
,
I
would
even
rather
lay
it
uselessly
by
than
dispose
of
it
*NL*
in
a
manner
so
painful
to
you
.
But
are
you
really
so
attached
to
this
*NL*
place
as
to
see
no
defect
in
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
said
he
.
``
To
me
it
is
faultless
.
Nay
,
more
,
I
consider
it
as
*NL*
the
only
form
of
building
in
which
happiness
is
attainable
,
and
were
I
*NL*
rich
enough
I
would
instantly
pull
Combe
down
,
and
build
it
up
again
in
*NL*
the
exact
plan
of
this
cottage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
dark
narrow
stairs
and
a
kitchen
that
smokes
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
*NL*
Elinor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
cried
he
in
the
same
eager
tone
,
``
with
all
and
every
thing
*NL*
belonging
to
it
;
--
in
no
one
convenience
or
INconvenience
about
it
,
*NL*
should
the
least
variation
be
perceptible
.
Then
,
and
then
only
,
under
*NL*
such
a
roof
,
I
might
perhaps
be
as
happy
at
Combe
as
I
have
been
at
*NL*
Barton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
flatter
myself
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
that
even
under
the
disadvantage
*NL*
of
better
rooms
and
a
broader
staircase
,
you
will
hereafter
find
your
*NL*
own
house
as
faultless
as
you
now
do
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
certainly
are
circumstances
,
''
said
Willoughby
,
``
which
might
*NL*
greatly
endear
it
to
me
;
but
this
place
will
always
have
one
claim
of
*NL*
my
affection
,
which
no
other
can
possibly
share
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
looked
with
pleasure
at
Marianne
,
whose
fine
eyes
were
*NL*
fixed
so
expressively
on
Willoughby
,
as
plainly
denoted
how
well
she
*NL*
understood
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
often
did
I
wish
,
''
added
he
,
``
when
I
was
at
Allenham
this
time
*NL*
twelvemonth
,
that
Barton
cottage
were
inhabited
!
I
never
passed
within
*NL*
view
of
it
without
admiring
its
situation
,
and
grieving
that
no
one
*NL*
should
live
in
it
.
How
little
did
I
then
think
that
the
very
first
*NL*
news
I
should
hear
from
Mrs.
Smith
,
when
I
next
came
into
the
country
,
*NL*
would
be
that
Barton
cottage
was
taken
:
and
I
felt
an
immediate
*NL*
satisfaction
and
interest
in
the
event
,
which
nothing
but
a
kind
of
*NL*
prescience
of
what
happiness
I
should
experience
from
it
,
can
account
*NL*
for
.
Must
it
not
have
been
so
,
Marianne
?
''
speaking
to
her
in
a
lowered
*NL*
voice
.
Then
continuing
his
former
tone
,
he
said
,
``
And
yet
this
house
*NL*
you
would
spoil
,
Mrs.
Dashwood
?
You
would
rob
it
of
its
simplicity
by
*NL*
imaginary
improvement
!
and
this
dear
parlour
in
which
our
acquaintance
*NL*
first
began
,
and
in
which
so
many
happy
hours
have
been
since
spent
by
*NL*
us
together
,
you
would
degrade
to
the
condition
of
a
common
entrance
,
*NL*
and
every
body
would
be
eager
to
pass
through
the
room
which
has
*NL*
hitherto
contained
within
itself
more
real
accommodation
and
comfort
*NL*
than
any
other
apartment
of
the
handsomest
dimensions
in
the
world
*NL*
could
possibly
afford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
again
assured
him
that
no
alteration
of
the
kind
should
*NL*
be
attempted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
good
woman
,
''
he
warmly
replied
.
``
Your
promise
makes
me
*NL*
easy
.
Extend
it
a
little
farther
,
and
it
will
make
me
happy
.
Tell
me
*NL*
that
not
only
your
house
will
remain
the
same
,
but
that
I
shall
ever
*NL*
find
you
and
yours
as
unchanged
as
your
dwelling
;
and
that
you
will
*NL*
always
consider
me
with
the
kindness
which
has
made
everything
*NL*
belonging
to
you
so
dear
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
promise
was
readily
given
,
and
Willoughby
's
behaviour
during
the
*NL*
whole
of
the
evening
declared
at
once
his
affection
and
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
see
you
tomorrow
to
dinner
?
''
said
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
when
he
was
*NL*
leaving
them
.
``
I
do
not
ask
you
to
come
in
the
morning
,
for
we
must
*NL*
walk
to
the
park
,
to
call
on
Lady
Middleton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
engaged
to
be
with
them
by
four
o'clock
.

CHAPTER
15
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
visit
to
Lady
Middleton
took
place
the
next
day
,
and
*NL*
two
of
her
daughters
went
with
her
;
but
Marianne
excused
herself
from
*NL*
being
of
the
party
,
under
some
trifling
pretext
of
employment
;
and
her
*NL*
mother
,
who
concluded
that
a
promise
had
been
made
by
Willoughby
the
*NL*
night
before
of
calling
on
her
while
they
were
absent
,
was
perfectly
*NL*
satisfied
with
her
remaining
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
return
from
the
park
they
found
Willoughby
's
curricle
and
*NL*
servant
in
waiting
at
the
cottage
,
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
was
convinced
that
*NL*
her
conjecture
had
been
just
.
So
far
it
was
all
as
she
had
foreseen
;
*NL*
but
on
entering
the
house
she
beheld
what
no
foresight
had
taught
her
*NL*
to
expect
.
They
were
no
sooner
in
the
passage
than
Marianne
came
*NL*
hastily
out
of
the
parlour
apparently
in
violent
affliction
,
with
her
*NL*
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
;
and
without
noticing
them
ran
up
stairs
.
*NL*
Surprised
and
alarmed
they
proceeded
directly
into
the
room
she
had
*NL*
just
quitted
,
where
they
found
only
Willoughby
,
who
was
leaning
against
*NL*
the
mantel-piece
with
his
back
towards
them
.
He
turned
round
on
their
*NL*
coming
in
,
and
his
countenance
shewed
that
he
strongly
partook
of
the
*NL*
emotion
which
over-powered
Marianne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
anything
the
matter
with
her
?
''
cried
Mrs.
Dashwood
as
she
*NL*
entered
--
``
is
she
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
,
''
he
replied
,
trying
to
look
cheerful
;
and
with
a
forced
*NL*
smile
presently
added
,
``
It
is
I
who
may
rather
expect
to
be
ill
--
for
I
*NL*
am
now
suffering
under
a
very
heavy
disappointment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Disappointment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
for
I
am
unable
to
keep
my
engagement
with
you
.
Mrs.
Smith
has
*NL*
this
morning
exercised
the
privilege
of
riches
upon
a
poor
dependent
*NL*
cousin
,
by
sending
me
on
business
to
London
.
I
have
just
received
my
*NL*
dispatches
,
and
taken
my
farewell
of
Allenham
;
and
by
way
of
*NL*
exhilaration
I
am
now
come
to
take
my
farewell
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
London
!
--
and
are
you
going
this
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Almost
this
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
very
unfortunate
.
But
Mrs.
Smith
must
be
obliged
;
--
and
her
*NL*
business
will
not
detain
you
from
us
long
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
coloured
as
he
replied
,
``
You
are
very
kind
,
but
I
have
no
idea
of
*NL*
returning
into
Devonshire
immediately
.
My
visits
to
Mrs.
Smith
are
*NL*
never
repeated
within
the
twelvemonth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
Mrs.
Smith
your
only
friend
?
Is
Allenham
the
only
house
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
to
which
you
will
be
welcome
?
For
shame
,
Willoughby
,
can
*NL*
you
wait
for
an
invitation
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
colour
increased
;
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
he
only
*NL*
replied
,
``
You
are
too
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
looked
at
Elinor
with
surprise
.
Elinor
felt
equal
*NL*
amazement
.
For
a
few
moments
every
one
was
silent
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
*NL*
first
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
to
add
,
my
dear
Willoughby
,
that
at
Barton
cottage
you
*NL*
will
always
be
welcome
;
for
I
will
not
press
you
to
return
here
*NL*
immediately
,
because
you
only
can
judge
how
far
THAT
might
be
pleasing
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Smith
;
and
on
this
head
I
shall
be
no
more
disposed
to
question
*NL*
your
judgment
than
to
doubt
your
inclination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
engagements
at
present
,
''
replied
Willoughby
,
confusedly
,
``
are
of
*NL*
such
a
nature
--
that
--
I
dare
not
flatter
myself
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopt
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
was
too
much
astonished
to
speak
,
and
another
*NL*
pause
succeeded
.
This
was
broken
by
Willoughby
,
who
said
with
a
faint
*NL*
smile
,
``
It
is
folly
to
linger
in
this
manner
.
I
will
not
torment
*NL*
myself
any
longer
by
remaining
among
friends
whose
society
it
is
*NL*
impossible
for
me
now
to
enjoy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
hastily
took
leave
of
them
all
and
left
the
room
.
They
saw
him
*NL*
step
into
his
carriage
,
and
in
a
minute
it
was
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
felt
too
much
for
speech
,
and
instantly
quitted
the
*NL*
parlour
to
give
way
in
solitude
to
the
concern
and
alarm
which
this
*NL*
sudden
departure
occasioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
uneasiness
was
at
least
equal
to
her
mother
's
.
She
thought
of
*NL*
what
had
just
passed
with
anxiety
and
distrust
.
Willoughby
's
behaviour
*NL*
in
taking
leave
of
them
,
his
embarrassment
,
and
affectation
of
*NL*
cheerfulness
,
and
,
above
all
,
his
unwillingness
to
accept
her
mother
's
*NL*
invitation
,
a
backwardness
so
unlike
a
lover
,
so
unlike
himself
,
*NL*
greatly
disturbed
her
.
One
moment
she
feared
that
no
serious
design
*NL*
had
ever
been
formed
on
his
side
;
and
the
next
that
some
unfortunate
*NL*
quarrel
had
taken
place
between
him
and
her
sister
;
--
the
distress
in
*NL*
which
Marianne
had
quitted
the
room
was
such
as
a
serious
quarrel
could
*NL*
most
reasonably
account
for
,
though
when
she
considered
what
Marianne
's
*NL*
love
for
him
was
,
a
quarrel
seemed
almost
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whatever
might
be
the
particulars
of
their
separation
,
her
sister
's
*NL*
affliction
was
indubitable
;
and
she
thought
with
the
tenderest
*NL*
compassion
of
that
violent
sorrow
which
Marianne
was
in
all
probability
*NL*
not
merely
giving
way
to
as
a
relief
,
but
feeding
and
encouraging
as
a
*NL*
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
half
an
hour
her
mother
returned
,
and
though
her
eyes
were
*NL*
red
,
her
countenance
was
not
uncheerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
dear
Willoughby
is
now
some
miles
from
Barton
,
Elinor
,
''
said
she
,
*NL*
as
she
sat
down
to
work
,
``
and
with
how
heavy
a
heart
does
he
travel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
very
strange
.
So
suddenly
to
be
gone
!
It
seems
but
the
work
*NL*
of
a
moment
.
And
last
night
he
was
with
us
so
happy
,
so
cheerful
,
so
*NL*
affectionate
?
And
now
,
after
only
ten
minutes
notice
--
Gone
too
without
*NL*
intending
to
return
!
--
Something
more
than
what
he
owned
to
us
must
have
*NL*
happened
.
He
did
not
speak
,
he
did
not
behave
like
himself
.
YOU
must
*NL*
have
seen
the
difference
as
well
as
I
.
What
can
it
be
?
Can
they
have
*NL*
quarrelled
?
Why
else
should
he
have
shewn
such
unwillingness
to
accept
*NL*
your
invitation
here
?
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
inclination
that
he
wanted
,
Elinor
;
I
could
plainly
see
*NL*
THAT
.
He
had
not
the
power
of
accepting
it
.
I
have
thought
it
all
*NL*
over
I
assure
you
,
and
I
can
perfectly
account
for
every
thing
that
at
*NL*
first
seemed
strange
to
me
as
well
as
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
,
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
have
explained
it
to
myself
in
the
most
satisfactory
way
;
--
but
*NL*
you
,
Elinor
,
who
love
to
doubt
where
you
can
--
it
will
not
satisfy
YOU
,
*NL*
I
know
;
but
you
shall
not
talk
ME
out
of
my
trust
in
it
.
I
am
*NL*
persuaded
that
Mrs.
Smith
suspects
his
regard
for
Marianne
,
disapproves
*NL*
of
it
,
-LRB-
perhaps
because
she
has
other
views
for
him
,
-RRB-
and
on
that
*NL*
account
is
eager
to
get
him
away
;
--
and
that
the
business
which
she
*NL*
sends
him
off
to
transact
is
invented
as
an
excuse
to
dismiss
him
.
*NL*
This
is
what
I
believe
to
have
happened
.
He
is
,
moreover
,
aware
that
*NL*
she
DOES
disapprove
the
connection
,
he
dares
not
therefore
at
present
*NL*
confess
to
her
his
engagement
with
Marianne
,
and
he
feels
himself
*NL*
obliged
,
from
his
dependent
situation
,
to
give
into
her
schemes
,
and
*NL*
absent
himself
from
Devonshire
for
a
while
.
You
will
tell
me
,
I
know
,
*NL*
that
this
may
or
may
NOT
have
happened
;
but
I
will
listen
to
no
cavil
,
*NL*
unless
you
can
point
out
any
other
method
of
understanding
the
affair
*NL*
as
satisfactory
at
this
.
And
now
,
Elinor
,
what
have
you
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
for
you
have
anticipated
my
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
would
have
told
me
,
that
it
might
or
might
not
have
happened
.
*NL*
Oh
,
Elinor
,
how
incomprehensible
are
your
feelings
!
You
had
rather
*NL*
take
evil
upon
credit
than
good
.
You
had
rather
look
out
for
misery
*NL*
for
Marianne
,
and
guilt
for
poor
Willoughby
,
than
an
apology
for
the
*NL*
latter
.
You
are
resolved
to
think
him
blameable
,
because
he
took
leave
*NL*
of
us
with
less
affection
than
his
usual
behaviour
has
shewn
.
And
is
*NL*
no
allowance
to
be
made
for
inadvertence
,
or
for
spirits
depressed
by
*NL*
recent
disappointment
?
Are
no
probabilities
to
be
accepted
,
merely
*NL*
because
they
are
not
certainties
?
Is
nothing
due
to
the
man
whom
we
*NL*
have
all
such
reason
to
love
,
and
no
reason
in
the
world
to
think
ill
*NL*
of
?
To
the
possibility
of
motives
unanswerable
in
themselves
,
though
*NL*
unavoidably
secret
for
a
while
?
And
,
after
all
,
what
is
it
you
suspect
*NL*
him
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
hardly
tell
myself
.
But
suspicion
of
something
unpleasant
is
*NL*
the
inevitable
consequence
of
such
an
alteration
as
we
just
witnessed
*NL*
in
him
.
There
is
great
truth
,
however
,
in
what
you
have
now
urged
of
*NL*
the
allowances
which
ought
to
be
made
for
him
,
and
it
is
my
wish
to
be
*NL*
candid
in
my
judgment
of
every
body
.
Willoughby
may
undoubtedly
have
*NL*
very
sufficient
reasons
for
his
conduct
,
and
I
will
hope
that
he
has
.
*NL*
But
it
would
have
been
more
like
Willoughby
to
acknowledge
them
at
*NL*
once
.
Secrecy
may
be
advisable
;
but
still

leave
her

for
months

telling

strange

is

You

you

man
of

honour
and
feeling

Has
there
been
any
inconsistency
on
his
side
to

deceitful

*NL*
``
I

I
believe
not

''
cried
Elinor

``
I
love
Willoughby
,
*NL*
sincerely
love
him
;
and
suspicion
of
his
integrity
can
not
be
more
*NL*
painful
to
yourself
than
to
me
.
It
has
been
involuntary
,
and
I
will
*NL*
not
encourage
it
.
I
was
startled
,
I
confess
,
by
the
alteration
in
his
*NL*
manners
this
morning
;
--
he
did
not
speak
like
himself
,
and
did
not
*NL*
return
your
kindness
with
any
cordiality
.
But
all
this
may
be
*NL*
explained
by
such
a
situation
of
his
affairs
as
you
have
supposed
.
He
*NL*
had
just
parted
from
my
sister
,
had
seen
her
leave
him
in
the
greatest
*NL*
affliction
;
and
if
he
felt
obliged
,
from
a
fear
of
offending
Mrs.
*NL*
Smith
,
to
resist
the
temptation
of
returning
here
soon
,
and
yet
aware
*NL*
that
by
declining
your
invitation
,
by
saying
that
he
was
going
away
for
*NL*
some
time
,
he
should
seem
to
act
an
ungenerous
,
a
suspicious
part
by
*NL*
our
family
,
he
might
well
be
embarrassed
and
disturbed
.
In
such
a
*NL*
case
,
a
plain
and
open
avowal
of
his
difficulties
would
have
been
more
*NL*
to
his
honour
I
think
,
as
well
as
more
consistent
with
his
general
*NL*
character
;
--
but
I
will
not
raise
objections
against
any
one
's
conduct
*NL*
on
so
illiberal
a
foundation
,
as
a
difference
in
judgment
from
myself
,
*NL*
or
a
deviation
from
what
I
may
think
right
and
consistent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
very
properly
.
Willoughby
certainly
does
not
deserve
to
be
*NL*
suspected
.
Though
WE
have
not
known
him
long
,
he
is
no
stranger
in
*NL*
this
part
of
the
world
;
and
who
has
ever
spoken
to
his
disadvantage
?
*NL*
Had
he
been
in
a
situation
to
act
independently
and
marry
immediately
,
*NL*
it
might
have
been
odd
that
he
should
leave
us
without
acknowledging
*NL*
everything
to
me
at
once
:
but
this
is
not
the
case
.
It
is
an
*NL*
engagement
in
some
respects
not
prosperously
begun
,
for
their
marriage
*NL*
must
be
at
a
very
uncertain
distance
;
and
even
secrecy
,
as
far
as
it
*NL*
can
be
observed
,
may
now
be
very
advisable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
Margaret
;
and
Elinor
was
then
*NL*
at
liberty
to
think
over
the
representations
of
her
mother
,
to
*NL*
acknowledge
the
probability
of
many
,
and
hope
for
the
justice
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
saw
nothing
of
Marianne
till
dinner
time
,
when
she
entered
the
*NL*
room
and
took
her
place
at
the
table
without
saying
a
word
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
were
red
and
swollen
;
and
it
seemed
as
if
her
tears
were
even
then
*NL*
restrained
with
difficulty
.
She
avoided
the
looks
of
them
all
,
could
*NL*
neither
eat
nor
speak
,
and
after
some
time
,
on
her
mother
's
silently
*NL*
pressing
her
hand
with
tender
compassion
,
her
small
degree
of
fortitude
*NL*
was
quite
overcome
,
she
burst
into
tears
and
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
violent
oppression
of
spirits
continued
the
whole
evening
.
She
*NL*
was
without
any
power
,
because
she
was
without
any
desire
of
command
*NL*
over
herself
.
The
slightest
mention
of
anything
relative
to
Willoughby
*NL*
overpowered
her
in
an
instant
;
and
though
her
family
were
most
*NL*
anxiously
attentive
to
her
comfort
,
it
was
impossible
for
them
,
if
they
*NL*
spoke
at
all
,
to
keep
clear
of
every
subject
which
her
feelings
*NL*
connected
with
him
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
16
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
would
have
thought
herself
very
inexcusable
had
she
been
able
*NL*
to
sleep
at
all
the
first
night
after
parting
from
Willoughby
.
She
*NL*
would
have
been
ashamed
to
look
her
family
in
the
face
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
had
she
not
risen
from
her
bed
in
more
need
of
repose
than
*NL*
when
she
lay
down
in
it
.
But
the
feelings
which
made
such
composure
a
*NL*
disgrace
,
left
her
in
no
danger
of
incurring
it
.
She
was
awake
the
*NL*
whole
night
,
and
she
wept
the
greatest
part
of
it
.
She
got
up
with
a
*NL*
headache
,
was
unable
to
talk
,
and
unwilling
to
take
any
nourishment
;
*NL*
giving
pain
every
moment
to
her
mother
and
sisters
,
and
forbidding
all
*NL*
attempt
at
consolation
from
either
.
Her
sensibility
was
potent
enough
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
breakfast
was
over
she
walked
out
by
herself
,
and
wandered
about
*NL*
the
village
of
Allenham
,
indulging
the
recollection
of
past
enjoyment
*NL*
and
crying
over
the
present
reverse
for
the
chief
of
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
passed
off
in
the
equal
indulgence
of
feeling
.
She
played
*NL*
over
every
favourite
song
that
she
had
been
used
to
play
to
Willoughby
,
*NL*
every
air
in
which
their
voices
had
been
oftenest
joined
,
and
sat
at
*NL*
the
instrument
gazing
on
every
line
of
music
that
he
had
written
out
*NL*
for
her
,
till
her
heart
was
so
heavy
that
no
farther
sadness
could
be
*NL*
gained
;
and
this
nourishment
of
grief
was
every
day
applied
.
She
spent
*NL*
whole
hours
at
the
pianoforte
alternately
singing
and
crying
;
her
voice
*NL*
often
totally
suspended
by
her
tears
.
In
books
too
,
as
well
as
in
*NL*
music
,
she
courted
the
misery
which
a
contrast
between
the
past
and
*NL*
present
was
certain
of
giving
.
She
read
nothing
but
what
they
had
been
*NL*
used
to
read
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
violence
of
affliction
indeed
could
not
be
supported
for
ever
;
it
*NL*
sunk
within
a
few
days
into
a
calmer
melancholy
;
but
these
employments
,
*NL*
to
which
she
daily
recurred
,
her
solitary
walks
and
silent
meditations
,
*NL*
still
produced
occasional
effusions
of
sorrow
as
lively
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
letter
from
Willoughby
came
;
and
none
seemed
expected
by
Marianne
.
*NL*
Her
mother
was
surprised
,
and
Elinor
again
became
uneasy
.
But
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashwood
could
find
explanations
whenever
she
wanted
them
,
which
at
*NL*
least
satisfied
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
Elinor
,
''
said
she
,
``
how
very
often
Sir
John
fetches
our
*NL*
letters
himself
from
the
post
,
and
carries
them
to
it
.
We
have
already
*NL*
agreed
that
secrecy
may
be
necessary
,
and
we
must
acknowledge
that
it
*NL*
could
not
be
maintained
if
their
correspondence
were
to
pass
through
*NL*
Sir
John
's
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
not
deny
the
truth
of
this
,
and
she
tried
to
find
in
it
a
*NL*
motive
sufficient
for
their
silence
.
But
there
was
one
method
so
*NL*
direct
,
so
simple
,
and
in
her
opinion
so
eligible
of
knowing
the
real
*NL*
state
of
the
affair
,
and
of
instantly
removing
all
mystery
,
that
she
*NL*
could
not
help
suggesting
it
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
not
ask
Marianne
at
once
,
''
said
she
,
``
whether
she
is
or
she
*NL*
is
not
engaged
to
Willoughby
?
From
you
,
her
mother
,
and
so
kind
,
so
*NL*
indulgent
a
mother
,
the
question
could
not
give
offence
.
It
would
be
*NL*
the
natural
result
of
your
affection
for
her
.
She
used
to
be
all
*NL*
unreserve
,
and
to
you
more
especially
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
ask
such
a
question
for
the
world
.
Supposing
it
possible
*NL*
that
they
are
not
engaged
,
what
distress
would
not
such
an
enquiry
*NL*
inflict
!
At
any
rate
it
would
be
most
ungenerous
.
I
should
never
*NL*
deserve
her
confidence
again
,
after
forcing
from
her
a
confession
of
*NL*
what
is
meant
at
present
to
be
unacknowledged
to
any
one
.
I
know
*NL*
Marianne
's
heart
:
I
know
that
she
dearly
loves
me
,
and
that
I
shall
not
*NL*
be
the
last
to
whom
the
affair
is
made
known
,
when
circumstances
make
*NL*
the
revealment
of
it
eligible
.
I
would
not
attempt
to
force
the
*NL*
confidence
of
any
one
;
of
a
child
much
less
;
because
a
sense
of
duty
*NL*
would
prevent
the
denial
which
her
wishes
might
direct
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
thought
this
generosity
overstrained
,
considering
her
sister
's
*NL*
youth
,
and
urged
the
matter
farther
,
but
in
vain
;
common
sense
,
common
*NL*
care
,
common
prudence
,
were
all
sunk
in
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
romantic
*NL*
delicacy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
several
days
before
Willoughby
's
name
was
mentioned
before
*NL*
Marianne
by
any
of
her
family
;
Sir
John
and
Mrs.
Jennings
,
indeed
,
were
*NL*
not
so
nice
;
their
witticisms
added
pain
to
many
a
painful
hour
;
--
but
*NL*
one
evening
,
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
accidentally
taking
up
a
volume
of
*NL*
Shakespeare
,
exclaimed
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
never
finished
Hamlet
,
Marianne
;
our
dear
Willoughby
went
away
*NL*
before
we
could
get
through
it
.
We
will
put
it
by
,
that
when
he
comes
*NL*
again
...
But
it
may
be
months
,
perhaps
,
before
THAT
happens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Months
!
''
cried
Marianne
,
with
strong
surprise
.
``
No
--
nor
many
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
was
sorry
for
what
she
had
said
;
but
it
gave
Elinor
*NL*
pleasure
,
as
it
produced
a
reply
from
Marianne
so
expressive
of
*NL*
confidence
in
Willoughby
and
knowledge
of
his
intentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
about
a
week
after
his
leaving
the
country
,
Marianne
was
*NL*
prevailed
on
to
join
her
sisters
in
their
usual
walk
,
instead
of
*NL*
wandering
away
by
herself
.
Hitherto
she
had
carefully
avoided
every
*NL*
companion
in
her
rambles
.
If
her
sisters
intended
to
walk
on
the
*NL*
downs
,
she
directly
stole
away
towards
the
lanes
;
if
they
talked
of
the
*NL*
valley
,
she
was
as
speedy
in
climbing
the
hills
,
and
could
never
be
*NL*
found
when
the
others
set
off
.
But
at
length
she
was
secured
by
the
*NL*
exertions
of
Elinor
,
who
greatly
disapproved
such
continual
seclusion
.
*NL*
They
walked
along
the
road
through
the
valley
,
and
chiefly
in
silence
,
*NL*
for
Marianne
's
MIND
could
not
be
controlled
,
and
Elinor
,
satisfied
with
*NL*
gaining
one
point
,
would
not
then
attempt
more
.
Beyond
the
entrance
of
*NL*
the
valley
,
where
the
country
,
though
still
rich
,
was
less
wild
and
*NL*
more
open
,
a
long
stretch
of
the
road
which
they
had
travelled
on
first
*NL*
coming
to
Barton
,
lay
before
them
;
and
on
reaching
that
point
,
they
*NL*
stopped
to
look
around
them
,
and
examine
a
prospect
which
formed
the
*NL*
distance
of
their
view
from
the
cottage
,
from
a
spot
which
they
had
*NL*
never
happened
to
reach
in
any
of
their
walks
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amongst
the
objects
in
the
scene
,
they
soon
discovered
an
animated
one
;
*NL*
it
was
a
man
on
horseback
riding
towards
them
.
In
a
few
minutes
they
*NL*
could
distinguish
him
to
be
a
gentleman
;
and
in
a
moment
afterwards
*NL*
Marianne
rapturously
exclaimed
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
he
;
it
is
indeed
;
--
I
know
it
is
!
''
--
and
was
hastening
to
meet
*NL*
him
,
when
Elinor
cried
out
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Marianne
,
I
think
you
are
mistaken
.
It
is
not
Willoughby
.
*NL*
The
person
is
not
tall
enough
for
him
,
and
has
not
his
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
,
he
has
,
''
cried
Marianne
,
``
I
am
sure
he
has
.
His
air
,
his
*NL*
coat
,
his
horse
.
I
knew
how
soon
he
would
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
eagerly
on
as
she
spoke
;
and
Elinor
,
to
screen
Marianne
from
*NL*
particularity
,
as
she
felt
almost
certain
of
its
not
being
Willoughby
,
*NL*
quickened
her
pace
and
kept
up
with
her
.
They
were
soon
within
thirty
*NL*
yards
of
the
gentleman
.
Marianne
looked
again
;
her
heart
sunk
within
*NL*
her
;
and
abruptly
turning
round
,
she
was
hurrying
back
,
when
the
voices
*NL*
of
both
her
sisters
were
raised
to
detain
her
;
a
third
,
almost
as
well
*NL*
known
as
Willoughby
's
,
joined
them
in
begging
her
to
stop
,
and
she
*NL*
turned
round
with
surprise
to
see
and
welcome
Edward
Ferrars
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
could
at
that
moment
be
*NL*
forgiven
for
not
being
Willoughby
;
the
only
one
who
could
have
gained
a
*NL*
smile
from
her
;
but
she
dispersed
her
tears
to
smile
on
HIM
,
and
in
her
*NL*
sister
's
happiness
forgot
for
a
time
her
own
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dismounted
,
and
giving
his
horse
to
his
servant
,
walked
back
with
*NL*
them
to
Barton
,
whither
he
was
purposely
coming
to
visit
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
welcomed
by
them
all
with
great
cordiality
,
but
especially
by
*NL*
Marianne
,
who
showed
more
warmth
of
regard
in
her
reception
of
him
than
*NL*
even
Elinor
herself
.
To
Marianne
,
indeed
,
the
meeting
between
Edward
*NL*
and
her
sister
was
but
a
continuation
of
that
unaccountable
coldness
*NL*
which
she
had
often
observed
at
Norland
in
their
mutual
behaviour
.
On
*NL*
Edward
's
side
,
more
particularly
,
there
was
a
deficiency
of
all
that
a
*NL*
lover
ought
to
look
and
say
on
such
an
occasion
.
He
was
confused
,
*NL*
seemed
scarcely
sensible
of
pleasure
in
seeing
them
,
looked
neither
*NL*
rapturous
nor
gay
,
said
little
but
what
was
forced
from
him
by
*NL*
questions
,
and
distinguished
Elinor
by
no
mark
of
affection
.
Marianne
*NL*
saw
and
listened
with
increasing
surprise
.
She
began
almost
to
feel
a
*NL*
dislike
of
Edward
;
and
it
ended
,
as
every
feeling
must
end
with
her
,
by
*NL*
carrying
back
her
thoughts
to
Willoughby
,
whose
manners
formed
a
*NL*
contrast
sufficiently
striking
to
those
of
his
brother
elect
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
silence
which
succeeded
the
first
surprise
and
enquiries
*NL*
of
meeting
,
Marianne
asked
Edward
if
he
came
directly
from
London
.
No
,
*NL*
he
had
been
in
Devonshire
a
fortnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fortnight
!
''
she
repeated
,
surprised
at
his
being
so
long
in
the
same
*NL*
county
with
Elinor
without
seeing
her
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
rather
distressed
as
he
added
,
that
he
had
been
staying
with
*NL*
some
friends
near
Plymouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
lately
in
Sussex
?
''
said
Elinor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
at
Norland
about
a
month
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
does
dear
,
dear
Norland
look
?
''
cried
Marianne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
Norland
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
probably
looks
much
as
it
always
*NL*
does
at
this
time
of
the
year
.
The
woods
and
walks
thickly
covered
*NL*
with
dead
leaves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
cried
Marianne
,
``
with
what
transporting
sensation
have
I
formerly
*NL*
seen
them
fall
!
How
have
I
delighted
,
as
I
walked
,
to
see
them
driven
*NL*
in
showers
about
me
by
the
wind
!
What
feelings
have
they
,
the
season
,
*NL*
the
air
altogether
inspired
!
Now
there
is
no
one
to
regard
them
.
They
*NL*
are
seen
only
as
a
nuisance
,
swept
hastily
off
,
and
driven
as
much
as
*NL*
possible
from
the
sight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
every
one
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
who
has
your
passion
for
dead
*NL*
leaves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
my
feelings
are
not
often
shared
,
not
often
understood
.
But
*NL*
SOMETIMES
they
are
.
''
--
As
she
said
this
,
she
sunk
into
a
reverie
for
a
*NL*
few
moments
;
--
but
rousing
herself
again
,
``
Now
,
Edward
,
''
said
she
,
*NL*
calling
his
attention
to
the
prospect
,
``
here
is
Barton
valley
.
Look
up
*NL*
to
it
,
and
be
tranquil
if
you
can
.
Look
at
those
hills
!
Did
you
ever
*NL*
see
their
equals
?
To
the
left
is
Barton
park
,
amongst
those
woods
and
*NL*
plantations
.
You
may
see
the
end
of
the
house
.
And
there
,
beneath
*NL*
that
farthest
hill
,
which
rises
with
such
grandeur
,
is
our
cottage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
beautiful
country
,
''
he
replied
;
``
but
these
bottoms
must
be
*NL*
dirty
in
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
think
of
dirt
,
with
such
objects
before
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
replied
he
,
smiling
,
``
among
the
rest
of
the
objects
before
*NL*
me
,
I
see
a
very
dirty
lane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
!
''
said
Marianne
to
herself
as
she
walked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
an
agreeable
neighbourhood
here
?
Are
the
Middletons
pleasant
*NL*
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
all
,
''
answered
Marianne
;
``
we
could
not
be
more
unfortunately
*NL*
situated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marianne
,
''
cried
her
sister
,
``
how
can
you
say
so
?
How
can
you
be
so
*NL*
unjust
?
They
are
a
very
respectable
family
,
Mr.
Ferrars
;
and
towards
*NL*
us
have
behaved
in
the
friendliest
manner
.
Have
you
forgot
,
Marianne
,
*NL*
how
many
pleasant
days
we
have
owed
to
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Marianne
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
nor
how
many
painful
moments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
took
no
notice
of
this
;
and
directing
her
attention
to
their
*NL*
visitor
,
endeavoured
to
support
something
like
discourse
with
him
,
by
*NL*
talking
of
their
present
residence
,
its
conveniences
,
&
c.
extorting
*NL*
from
him
occasional
questions
and
remarks
.
His
coldness
and
reserve
*NL*
mortified
her
severely
;
she
was
vexed
and
half
angry
;
but
resolving
to
*NL*
regulate
her
behaviour
to
him
by
the
past
rather
than
the
present
,
she
*NL*
avoided
every
appearance
of
resentment
or
displeasure
,
and
treated
him
*NL*
as
she
thought
he
ought
to
be
treated
from
the
family
connection
.

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
was
surprised
only
for
a
moment
at
seeing
him
;
for
his
*NL*
coming
to
Barton
was
,
in
her
opinion
,
of
all
things
the
most
natural
.
*NL*
Her
joy
and
expression
of
regard
long
outlived
her
wonder
.
He
received
*NL*
the
kindest
welcome
from
her
;
and
shyness
,
coldness
,
reserve
could
not
*NL*
stand
against
such
a
reception
.
They
had
begun
to
fail
him
before
he
*NL*
entered
the
house
,
and
they
were
quite
overcome
by
the
captivating
*NL*
manners
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
.
Indeed
a
man
could
not
very
well
be
in
love
*NL*
with
either
of
her
daughters
,
without
extending
the
passion
to
her
;
and
*NL*
Elinor
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
soon
become
more
like
*NL*
himself
.
His
affections
seemed
to
reanimate
towards
them
all
,
and
his
*NL*
interest
in
their
welfare
again
became
perceptible
.
He
was
not
in
*NL*
spirits
,
however
;
he
praised
their
house
,
admired
its
prospect
,
was
*NL*
attentive
,
and
kind
;
but
still
he
was
not
in
spirits
.
The
whole
family
*NL*
perceived
it
,
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
attributing
it
to
some
want
of
*NL*
liberality
in
his
mother
,
sat
down
to
table
indignant
against
all
*NL*
selfish
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
views
for
you
at
present
,
Edward
?
''
said
she
,
*NL*
when
dinner
was
over
and
they
had
drawn
round
the
fire
;
``
are
you
still
*NL*
to
be
a
great
orator
in
spite
of
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
hope
my
mother
is
now
convinced
that
I
have
no
more
talents
than
*NL*
inclination
for
a
public
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
is
your
fame
to
be
established
?
for
famous
you
must
be
to
*NL*
satisfy
all
your
family
;
and
with
no
inclination
for
expense
,
no
*NL*
affection
for
strangers
,
no
profession
,
and
no
assurance
,
you
may
find
*NL*
it
a
difficult
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
attempt
it
.
I
have
no
wish
to
be
distinguished
;
and
have
*NL*
every
reason
to
hope
I
never
shall
.
Thank
Heaven
!
I
can
not
be
forced
*NL*
into
genius
and
eloquence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
ambition
,
I
well
know
.
Your
wishes
are
all
moderate

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
moderate
as
those
of
the
rest
of
the
world
,
I
believe
.
I
wish
as
*NL*
well
as
every
body
else
to
be
perfectly
happy
;
but
,
like
every
body
*NL*
else
it
must
be
in
my
own
way
.
Greatness
will
not
make
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange
that
it
would
!
''
cried
Marianne
.
``
What
have
wealth
or
grandeur
*NL*
to
do
with
happiness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grandeur
has
but
little
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
but
wealth
has
much
to
do
with
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elinor
,
for
shame
!
''
said
Marianne
,
``
money
can
only
give
happiness
*NL*
where
there
is
nothing
else
to
give
it
.
Beyond
a
competence
,
it
can
*NL*
afford
no
real
satisfaction
,
as
far
as
mere
self
is
concerned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Elinor
,
smiling
,
``
we
may
come
to
the
same
point
.
YOUR
*NL*
competence
and
MY
wealth
are
very
much
alike
,
I
dare
say
;
and
without
*NL*
them
,
as
the
world
goes
now
,
we
shall
both
agree
that
every
kind
of
*NL*
external
comfort
must
be
wanting
.
Your
ideas
are
only
more
noble
than
*NL*
mine
.
Come
,
what
is
your
competence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
eighteen
hundred
or
two
thousand
a
year
;
not
more
than
THAT
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
laughed
.
``
TWO
thousand
a
year
!
ONE
is
my
wealth
!
I
guessed
how
*NL*
it
would
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
two
thousand
a-year
is
a
very
moderate
income
,
''
said
Marianne
.
*NL*
``
A
family
can
not
well
be
maintained
on
a
smaller
.
I
am
sure
I
am
not
*NL*
extravagant
in
my
demands
.
A
proper
establishment
of
servants
,
a
*NL*
carriage
,
perhaps
two
,
and
hunters
,
can
not
be
supported
on
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
smiled
again
,
to
hear
her
sister
describing
so
accurately
their
*NL*
future
expenses
at
Combe
Magna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hunters
!
''
repeated
Edward
--
``
but
why
must
you
have
hunters
?
Every
body
*NL*
does
not
hunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
coloured
as
she
replied
,
``
But
most
people
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
''
said
Margaret
,
striking
out
a
novel
thought
,
``
that
somebody
*NL*
would
give
us
all
a
large
fortune
apiece
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
that
they
would
!
''
cried
Marianne
,
her
eyes
sparkling
with
*NL*
animation
,
and
her
cheeks
glowing
with
the
delight
of
such
imaginary
*NL*
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
all
unanimous
in
that
wish
,
I
suppose

said
Elinor
,
``
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
insufficiency
of
wealth
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
!
''
cried
Margaret
,
``
how
happy
I
should
be
!
I
wonder
what
I
*NL*
should
do
with
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
looked
as
if
she
had
no
doubt
on
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
puzzled
to
spend
so
large
a
fortune
myself
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashwood
,
``
if
my
children
were
all
to
be
rich

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
begin
your

observed
Elinor
,
``

your
difficulties

soon
vanish

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
magnificent
orders
would
travel
from
this
family

Edward
,
``
in

an

I
can
hardly
tell

originated

is
guided

off

CHAPTER
18
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
saw
,
with
great
uneasiness
the
low
spirits
of
her
friend
.
His
*NL*
visit
afforded
her
but
a
very
partial
satisfaction
,
while
his
own
*NL*
enjoyment
in
it
appeared
so
imperfect
.
It
was
evident
that
he
was
*NL*
unhappy
;
she
wished
it
were
equally
evident
that
he
still
distinguished
*NL*
her
by
the
same
affection
which
once
she
had
felt
no
doubt
of
*NL*
inspiring
;
but
hitherto
the
continuance
of
his
preference
seemed
very
*NL*
uncertain
;
and
the
reservedness
of
his
manner
towards
her
contradicted
*NL*
one
moment
what
a
more
animated
look
had
intimated
the
preceding
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
joined
her
and
Marianne
in
the
breakfast-room
the
next
morning
*NL*
before
the
others
were
down
;
and
Marianne
,
who
was
always
eager
to
*NL*
promote
their
happiness
as
far
as
she
could
,
soon
left
them
to
*NL*
themselves
.
But
before
she
was
half
way
upstairs
she
heard
the
parlour
*NL*
door
open
,
and
,
turning
round
,
was
astonished
to
see
Edward
himself
*NL*
come
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
into
the
village
to
see
my
horses
,
''
said
he
,
``
as
you
are
*NL*
not
yet
ready
for
breakfast
;
I
shall
be
back
again
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
***
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
returned
to
them
with
fresh
admiration
of
the
surrounding
*NL*
country
;
in
his
walk
to
the
village
,
he
had
seen
many
parts
of
the
*NL*
valley
to
advantage
;
and
the
village
itself
,
in
a
much
higher
situation
*NL*
than
the
cottage
,
afforded
a
general
view
of
the
whole
,
which
had
*NL*
exceedingly
pleased
him
.
This
was
a
subject
which
ensured
Marianne
's
*NL*
attention
,
and
she
was
beginning
to
describe
her
own
admiration
of
*NL*
these
scenes
,
and
to
question
him
more
minutely
on
the
objects
that
had
*NL*
particularly
struck
him
,
when
Edward
interrupted
her
by
saying
,
``
You
*NL*
must
not
enquire
too
far
,
Marianne
--
remember
I
have
no
knowledge
in
the
*NL*
picturesque
,
and
I
shall
offend
you
by
my
ignorance
and
want
of
taste
*NL*
if
we
come
to
particulars
.
I
shall
call
hills
steep
,
which
ought
to
be
*NL*
bold
;
surfaces
strange
and
uncouth
,
which
ought
to
be
irregular
and
*NL*
rugged
;
and
distant
objects
out
of
sight
,
which
ought
only
to
be
*NL*
indistinct
through
the
soft
medium
of
a
hazy
atmosphere
.
You
must
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
such
admiration
as
I
can
honestly
give
.
I
call
it
a
*NL*
very
fine
country
--
the
hills
are
steep
,
the
woods
seem
full
of
fine
*NL*
timber
,
and
the
valley
looks
comfortable
and
snug
--
with
rich
meadows
*NL*
and
several
neat
farm
houses
scattered
here
and
there
.
It
exactly
*NL*
answers
my
idea
of
a
fine
country
,
because
it
unites
beauty
with
*NL*
utility
--
and
I
dare
say
it
is
a
picturesque
one
too
,
because
you
admire
*NL*
it
;
I
can
easily
believe
it
to
be
full
of
rocks
and
promontories
,
grey
*NL*
moss
and
brush
wood
,
but
these
are
all
lost
on
me
.
I
know
nothing
of
*NL*
the
picturesque
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
it
is
but
too
true
,
''
said
Marianne
;
``
but
why
should
you
*NL*
boast
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
that
to
avoid
one
kind
of
affectation
,
*NL*
Edward
here
falls
into
another
.
Because
he
believes
many
people
*NL*
pretend
to
more
admiration
of
the
beauties
of
nature
than
they
really
*NL*
feel
,
and
is
disgusted
with
such
pretensions
,
he
affects
greater
*NL*
indifference
and
less
discrimination
in
viewing
them
himself
than
he
*NL*
possesses
.
He
is
fastidious
and
will
have
an
affectation
of
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
true
,
''
said
Marianne
,
``
that
admiration
of
landscape
scenery
*NL*
is
become
a
mere
jargon
.
Every
body
pretends
to
feel
and
tries
to
*NL*
describe
with
the
taste
and
elegance
of
him
who
first
defined
what
*NL*
picturesque
beauty
was
.
I
detest
jargon
of
every
kind
,
and
sometimes
I
*NL*
have
kept
my
feelings
to
myself
,
because
I
could
find
no
language
to
*NL*
describe
them
in
but
what
was
worn
and
hackneyed
out
of
all
sense
and
*NL*
meaning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
convinced
,
''
said
Edward
,
``
that
you
really
feel
all
the
delight
in
*NL*
a
fine
prospect
which
you
profess
to
feel
.
But
,
in
return
,
your
sister
*NL*
must
allow
me
to
feel
no
more
than
I
profess
.
I
like
a
fine
prospect
,
*NL*
but
not
on
picturesque
principles
.
I
do
not
like
crooked
,
twisted
,
*NL*
blasted
trees
.
I
admire
them
much
more
if
they
are
tall
,
straight
,
and
*NL*
flourishing
.
I
do
not
like
ruined
,
tattered
cottages
.
I
am
not
fond
*NL*
of
nettles
or
thistles
,
or
heath
blossoms
.
I
have
more
pleasure
in
a
*NL*
snug
farm-house
than
a
watch-tower
--
and
a
troop
of
tidy
,
happy
villages
*NL*
please
me
better
than
the
finest
banditti
in
the
world

''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
looked
with
amazement
at
Edward
,
with
compassion
at
her
*NL*
sister
.
Elinor
only
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
was
continued
no
farther
;
and
Marianne
remained
*NL*
thoughtfully
silent
,
till
a
new
object
suddenly
engaged
her
attention
.
*NL*
She
was
sitting
by
Edward
,
and
in
taking
his
tea
from
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
*NL*
his
hand
passed
so
directly
before
her
,
as
to
make
a
ring
,
with
a
plait
*NL*
of
hair
in
the
centre
,
very
conspicuous
on
one
of
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
you
wear
a
ring
before
,
Edward
,
''
she
cried
.
``
Is
that
*NL*
Fanny
's
hair
?
I
remember
her
promising
to
give
you
some
.
But
I
should
*NL*
have
thought
her
hair
had
been
darker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
spoke
inconsiderately
what
she
really
felt
--
but
when
she
saw
*NL*
how
much
she
had
pained
Edward
,
her
own
vexation
at
her
want
of
thought
*NL*
could
not
be
surpassed
by
his
.
He
coloured
very
deeply
,
and
giving
a
*NL*
momentary
glance
at
Elinor
,
replied
,
``
Yes
;
it
is
my
sister
's
hair
.
The
*NL*
setting
always
casts
a
different
shade
on
it
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
had
met
his
eye
,
and
looked
conscious
likewise
.
That
the
hair
*NL*
was
her
own
,
she
instantaneously
felt
as
well
satisfied
as
Marianne
;
*NL*
the
only
difference
in
their
conclusions
was
,
that
what
Marianne
*NL*
considered
as
a
free
gift
from
her
sister
,
Elinor
was
conscious
must
*NL*
have
been
procured
by
some
theft
or
contrivance
unknown
to
herself
.
*NL*
She
was
not
in
a
humour
,
however
,
to
regard
it
as
an
affront
,
and
*NL*
affecting
to
take
no
notice
of
what
passed
,
by
instantly
talking
of
*NL*
something
else
,
she
internally
resolved
henceforward
to
catch
every
*NL*
opportunity
of
eyeing
the
hair
and
of
satisfying
herself
,
beyond
all
*NL*
doubt
,
that
it
was
exactly
the
shade
of
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
's
embarrassment
lasted
some
time
,
and
it
ended
in
an
absence
of
*NL*
mind
still
more
settled
.
He
was
particularly
grave
the
whole
morning
.
*NL*
Marianne
severely
censured
herself
for
what
she
had
said
;
but
her
own
*NL*
forgiveness
might
have
been
more
speedy
,
had
she
known
how
little
*NL*
offence
it
had
given
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
middle
of
the
day
,
they
were
visited
by
Sir
John
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
,
who
,
having
heard
of
the
arrival
of
a
gentleman
at
the
*NL*
cottage
,
came
to
take
a
survey
of
the
guest
.
With
the
assistance
of
*NL*
his
mother-in-law
,
Sir
John
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
the
name
*NL*
of
Ferrars
began
with
an
F.
and
this
prepared
a
future
mine
of
raillery
*NL*
against
the
devoted
Elinor
,
which
nothing
but
the
newness
of
their
*NL*
acquaintance
with
Edward
could
have
prevented
from
being
immediately
*NL*
sprung
.
But
,
as
it
was
,
she
only
learned
,
from
some
very
significant
*NL*
looks
,
how
far
their
penetration
,
founded
on
Margaret
's
instructions
,
*NL*
extended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
John
never
came
to
the
Dashwoods
without
either
inviting
them
to
*NL*
dine
at
the
park
the
next
day
,
or
to
drink
tea
with
them
that
evening
.
*NL*
On
the
present
occasion
,
for
the
better
entertainment
of
their
visitor
,
*NL*
towards
whose
amusement
he
felt
himself
bound
to
contribute
,
he
wished
*NL*
to
engage
them
for
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
MUST
drink
tea
with
us
to
night
,
''
said
he
,
``
for
we
shall
be
quite
*NL*
alone
--
and
tomorrow
you
must
absolutely
dine
with
us
,
for
we
shall
be
a
*NL*
large
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
enforced
the
necessity
.
``
And
who
knows
but
you
may
raise
*NL*
a
dance
,
''
said
she
.
``
And
that
will
tempt
YOU
,
Miss
Marianne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dance
!
''
cried
Marianne
.
``
Impossible
!
Who
is
to
dance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
!
why
yourselves
,
and
the
Careys
,
and
Whitakers
to
be
sure
.
--
What
!
*NL*
you
thought
nobody
could
dance
because
a
certain
person
that
shall
be
*NL*
nameless
is
gone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
with
all
my
soul
,
''
cried
Sir
John
,
``
that
Willoughby
were
among
*NL*
us
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
and
Marianne
's
blushing
,
gave
new
suspicions
to
Edward
.
``
And
who
*NL*
is
Willoughby
?
''
said
he
,
in
a
low
voice
,
to
Miss
Dashwood
,
by
whom
he
*NL*
was
sitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
him
a
brief
reply
.
Marianne
's
countenance
was
more
*NL*
communicative
.
Edward
saw
enough
to
comprehend
,
not
only
the
meaning
*NL*
of
others
,
but
such
of
Marianne
's
expressions
as
had
puzzled
him
*NL*
before
;
and
when
their
visitors
left
them
,
he
went
immediately
round
*NL*
her
,
and
said
,
in
a
whisper
,
``
I
have
been
guessing
.
Shall
I
tell
you
*NL*
my
guess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
;
I
guess
that
Mr.
Willoughby
hunts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
was
surprised
and
confused
,
yet
she
could
not
help
smiling
at
*NL*
the
quiet
archness
of
his
manner
,
and
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Edward
!
How
can
you
?
--
But
the
time
will
come
I
hope
...
I
am
sure
*NL*
you
will
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
doubt
it
,
''
replied
he
,
rather
astonished
at
her
earnestness
*NL*
and
warmth
;
for
had
he
not
imagined
it
to
be
a
joke
for
the
good
of
her
*NL*
acquaintance
in
general
,
founded
only
on
a
something
or
a
nothing
*NL*
between
Mr.
Willoughby
and
herself
,
he
would
not
have
ventured
to
*NL*
mention
it
.

CHAPTER
19
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
remained
a
week
at
the
cottage
;
he
was
earnestly
pressed
by
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashwood
to
stay
longer
;
but
,
as
if
he
were
bent
only
on
*NL*
self-mortification
,
he
seemed
resolved
to
be
gone
when
his
enjoyment
*NL*
among
his
friends
was
at
the
height
.
His
spirits
,
during
the
last
two
*NL*
or
three
days
,
though
still
very
unequal
,
were
greatly
improved
--
he
*NL*
grew
more
and
more
partial
to
the
house
and
environs
--
never
spoke
of
*NL*
going
away
without
a
sigh
--
declared
his
time
to
be
wholly
*NL*
disengaged
--
even
doubted
to
what
place
he
should
go
when
he
left
*NL*
them
--
but
still
,
go
he
must
.
Never
had
any
week
passed
so
quickly
--
he
*NL*
could
hardly
believe
it
to
be
gone
.
He
said
so
repeatedly
;
other
*NL*
things
he
said
too
,
which
marked
the
turn
of
his
feelings
and
gave
the
*NL*
lie
to
his
actions
.
He
had
no
pleasure
at
Norland
;
he
detested
being
*NL*
in
town
;
but
either
to
Norland
or
London
,
he
must
go
.
He
valued
their
*NL*
kindness
beyond
any
thing
,
and
his
greatest
happiness
was
in
being
with
*NL*
them
.
Yet
,
he
must
leave
them
at
the
end
of
a
week
,
in
spite
of
their
*NL*
wishes
and
his
own
,
and
without
any
restraint
on
his
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
placed
all
that
was
astonishing
in
this
way
of
acting
to
his
*NL*
mother
's
account
;
and
it
was
happy
for
her
that
he
had
a
mother
whose
*NL*
character
was
so
imperfectly
known
to
her
,
as
to
be
the
general
excuse
*NL*
for
every
thing
strange
on
the
part
of
her
son
.
Disappointed
,
however
,
*NL*
and
vexed
as
she
was
,
and
sometimes
displeased
with
his
uncertain
*NL*
behaviour
to
herself
,
she
was
very
well
disposed
on
the
whole
to
regard
*NL*
his
actions
with
all
the
candid
allowances
and
generous
qualifications
,
*NL*
which
had
been
rather
more
painfully
extorted
from
her
,
for
*NL*
Willoughby
's
service
,
by
her
mother
.
His
want
of
spirits
,
of
openness
,
*NL*
and
of
consistency
,
were
most
usually
attributed
to
his
want
of
*NL*
independence
,
and
his
better
knowledge
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
disposition
*NL*
and
designs
.
The
shortness
of
his
visit
,
the
steadiness
of
his
purpose
*NL*
in
leaving
them
,
originated
in
the
same
fettered
inclination
,
the
same
*NL*
inevitable
necessity
of
temporizing
with
his
mother
.
The
old
*NL*
well-established
grievance
of
duty
against
will
,
parent
against
child
,
*NL*
was
the
cause
of
all
.
She
would
have
been
glad
to
know
when
these
*NL*
difficulties
were
to
cease
,
this
opposition
was
to
yield
,
--
when
Mrs.
*NL*
Ferrars
would
be
reformed
,
and
her
son
be
at
liberty
to
be
happy
.
But
*NL*
from
such
vain
wishes
she
was
forced
to
turn
for
comfort
to
the
renewal
*NL*
of
her
confidence
in
Edward
's
affection
,
to
the
remembrance
of
every
*NL*
mark
of
regard
in
look
or
word
which
fell
from
him
while
at
Barton
,
and
*NL*
above
all
to
that
flattering
proof
of
it
which
he
constantly
wore
round
*NL*
his
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
Edward
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
as
they
were
at
breakfast
the
*NL*
last
morning
,
``
you
would
be
a
happier
man
if
you
had
any
profession
to
*NL*
engage
your
time
and
give
an
interest
to
your
plans
and
actions
.
Some
*NL*
inconvenience
to
your
friends
,
indeed
,
might
result
from
it
--
you
would
*NL*
not
be
able
to
give
them
so
much
of
your
time
.
But
-LRB-
with
a
smile
-RRB-
you
*NL*
would
be
materially
benefited
in
one
particular
at
least
--
you
would
*NL*
know
where
to
go
when
you
left
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
assure
you
,
''
he
replied
,
``
that
I
have
long
thought
on
this
point
,
*NL*
as
you
think
now
.
It
has
been
,
and
is
,
and
probably
will
always
be
a
*NL*
heavy
misfortune
to
me
,
that
I
have
had
no
necessary
business
to
engage
*NL*
me
,
no
profession
to
give
me
employment
,
or
afford
me
any
thing
like
*NL*
independence
.
But
unfortunately
my
own
nicety
,
and
the
nicety
of
my
*NL*
friends
,
have
made
me
what
I
am
,
an
idle
,
helpless
being
.
We
never
*NL*
could
agree
in
our
choice
of
a
profession
.
I
always
preferred
the
*NL*
church
,
as
I
still
do
.
But
that
was
not
smart
enough
for
my
family
.
*NL*
They
recommended
the
army
.
That
was
a
great
deal
too
smart
for
me
.
*NL*
The
law
was
allowed
to
be
genteel
enough
;
many
young
men
,
who
had
*NL*
chambers
in
the
Temple
,
made
a
very
good
appearance
in
the
first
*NL*
circles
,
and
drove
about
town
in
very
knowing
gigs
.
But
I
had
no
*NL*
inclination
for
the
law
,
even
in
this
less
abstruse
study
of
it
,
which
*NL*
my
family
approved
.
As
for
the
navy
,
it
had
fashion
on
its
side
,
but
I
*NL*
was
too
old
when
the
subject
was
first
started
to
enter
it
--
and
,
at
*NL*
length
,
as
there
was
no
necessity
for
my
having
any
profession
at
all
,
*NL*
as
I
might
be
as
dashing
and
expensive
without
a
red
coat
on
my
back
as
*NL*
with
one
,
idleness
was
pronounced
on
the
whole
to
be
most
advantageous
*NL*
and
honourable
,
and
a
young
man
of
eighteen
is
not
in
general
so
*NL*
earnestly
bent
on
being
busy
as
to
resist
the
solicitations
of
his
*NL*
friends
to
do
nothing
.
I
was
therefore
entered
at
Oxford
and
have
been
*NL*
properly
idle
ever
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
consequence
of
which
,
I
suppose
,
will
be
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
*NL*
``
since
leisure
has
not
promoted
your
own
happiness
,
that
your
sons
will
*NL*
be
brought
up
to
as
many
pursuits
,
employments
,
professions
,
and
trades
*NL*
as
Columella
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
be
brought
up
,
''
said
he
,
in
a
serious
accent
,
``
to
be
as
*NL*
unlike
myself
as
is
possible
.
In
feeling
,
in
action
,
in
condition
,
in
*NL*
every
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
;
this
is
all
an
effusion
of
immediate
want
of
spirits
,
*NL*
Edward
.
You
are
in
a
melancholy
humour
,
and
fancy
that
any
one
unlike
*NL*
yourself
must
be
happy
.
But
remember
that
the
pain
of
parting
from
*NL*
friends
will
be
felt
by
every
body
at
times
,
whatever
be
their
*NL*
education
or
state
.
Know
your
own
happiness
.
You
want
nothing
but
*NL*
patience
--
or
give
it
a
more
fascinating
name
,
call
it
hope
.
Your
*NL*
mother
will
secure
to
you
,
in
time
,
that
independence
you
are
so
*NL*
anxious
for
;
it
is
her
duty
,
and
it
will
,
it
must
ere
long
become
her
*NL*
happiness
to
prevent
your
whole
youth
from
being
wasted
in
discontent
.
*NL*
How
much
may
not
a
few
months
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
replied
Edward
,
``
that
I
may
defy
many
months
to
produce
any
*NL*
good
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
desponding
turn
of
mind
,
though
it
could
not
be
communicated
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
gave
additional
pain
to
them
all
in
the
parting
,
which
*NL*
shortly
took
place
,
and
left
an
uncomfortable
impression
on
Elinor
's
*NL*
feelings
especially
,
which
required
some
trouble
and
time
to
subdue
.
*NL*
But
as
it
was
her
determination
to
subdue
it
,
and
to
prevent
herself
*NL*
from
appearing
to
suffer
more
than
what
all
her
family
suffered
on
his
*NL*
going
away
,
she
did
not
adopt
the
method
so
judiciously
employed
by
*NL*
Marianne
,
on
a
similar
occasion
,
to
augment
and
fix
her
sorrow
,
by
*NL*
seeking
silence
,
solitude
and
idleness
.
Their
means
were
as
different
*NL*
as
their
objects
,
and
equally
suited
to
the
advancement
of
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
sat
down
to
her
drawing-table
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
*NL*
house
,
busily
employed
herself
the
whole
day
,
neither
sought
nor
*NL*
avoided
the
mention
of
his
name
,
appeared
to
interest
herself
almost
as
*NL*
much
as
ever
in
the
general
concerns
of
the
family
,
and
if
,
by
this
*NL*
conduct
,
she
did
not
lessen
her
own
grief
,
it
was
at
least
prevented
*NL*
from
unnecessary
increase
,
and
her
mother
and
sisters
were
spared
much
*NL*
solicitude
on
her
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
behaviour
as
this
,
so
exactly
the
reverse
of
her
own
,
appeared
no
*NL*
more
meritorious
to
Marianne
,
than
her
own
had
seemed
faulty
to
her
.
*NL*
The
business
of
self-command
she
settled
very
easily
;
--
with
strong
*NL*
affections
it
was
impossible
,
with
calm
ones
it
could
have
no
merit
.
*NL*
That
her
sister
's
affections
WERE
calm
,
she
dared
not
deny
,
though
she
*NL*
blushed
to
acknowledge
it
;
and
of
the
strength
of
her
own
,
she
gave
a
*NL*
very
striking
proof
,
by
still
loving
and
respecting
that
sister
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
this
mortifying
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
shutting
herself
up
from
her
family
,
or
leaving
the
house
in
*NL*
determined
solitude
to
avoid
them
,
or
lying
awake
the
whole
night
to
*NL*
indulge
meditation
,
Elinor
found
every
day
afforded
her
leisure
enough
*NL*
to
think
of
Edward
,
and
of
Edward
's
behaviour
,
in
every
possible
*NL*
variety
which
the
different
state
of
her
spirits
at
different
times
*NL*
could
produce
,
--
with
tenderness
,
pity
,
approbation
,
censure
,
and
doubt
.
*NL*
There
were
moments
in
abundance
,
when
,
if
not
by
the
absence
of
her
*NL*
mother
and
sisters
,
at
least
by
the
nature
of
their
employments
,
*NL*
conversation
was
forbidden
among
them
,
and
every
effect
of
solitude
was
*NL*
produced
.
Her
mind
was
inevitably
at
liberty
;
her
thoughts
could
not
*NL*
be
chained
elsewhere
;
and
the
past
and
the
future
,
on
a
subject
so
*NL*
interesting
,
must
be
before
her
,
must
force
her
attention
,
and
engross
*NL*
her
memory
,
her
reflection
,
and
her
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
reverie
of
this
kind
,
as
she
sat
at
her
drawing-table
,
she
was
*NL*
roused
one
morning
,
soon
after
Edward
's
leaving
them
,
by
the
arrival
of
*NL*
company
.
She
happened
to
be
quite
alone
.
The
closing
of
the
little
*NL*
gate
,
at
the
entrance
of
the
green
court
in
front
of
the
house
,
drew
*NL*
her
eyes
to
the
window
,
and
she
saw
a
large
party
walking
up
to
the
*NL*
door
.
Amongst
them
were
Sir
John
and
Lady
Middleton
and
Mrs.
Jennings
,
*NL*
but
there
were
two
others
,
a
gentleman
and
lady
,
who
were
quite
unknown
*NL*
to
her
.
She
was
sitting
near
the
window
,
and
as
soon
as
Sir
John
*NL*
perceived
her
,
he
left
the
rest
of
the
party
to
the
ceremony
of
*NL*
knocking
at
the
door
,
and
stepping
across
the
turf
,
obliged
her
to
open
*NL*
the
casement
to
speak
to
him
,
though
the
space
was
so
short
between
the
*NL*
door
and
the
window
,
as
to
make
it
hardly
possible
to
speak
at
one
*NL*
without
being
heard
at
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
have
brought
you
some
strangers
.
How
do
you
like
*NL*
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
they
will
hear
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
if
they
do
.
It
is
only
the
Palmers
.
Charlotte
is
very
*NL*
pretty
,
I
can
tell
you
.
You
may
see
her
if
you
look
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Elinor
was
certain
of
seeing
her
in
a
couple
of
minutes
,
without
*NL*
taking
that
liberty
,
she
begged
to
be
excused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Marianne
?
Has
she
run
away
because
we
are
come
?
I
see
her
*NL*
instrument
is
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
walking
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
now
joined
by
Mrs.
Jennings
,
who
had
not
patience
enough
to
*NL*
wait
till
the
door
was
opened
before
she
told
HER
story
.
She
came
*NL*
hallooing
to
the
window
,
``
How
do
you
do
,
my
dear
?
How
does
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashwood
do
?
And
where
are
your
sisters
?
What
!
all
alone
!
you
will
be
*NL*
glad
of
a
little
company
to
sit
with
you
.
I
have
brought
my
other
son
*NL*
and
daughter
to
see
you
.
Only
think
of
their
coming
so
suddenly
!
I
*NL*
thought
I
heard
a
carriage
last
night
,
while
we
were
drinking
our
tea
,
*NL*
but
it
never
entered
my
head
that
it
could
be
them
.
I
thought
of
*NL*
nothing
but
whether
it
might
not
be
Colonel
Brandon
come
back
again
;
so
*NL*
I
said
to
Sir
John
,
I
do
think
I
hear
a
carriage
;
perhaps
it
is
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
come
back
again
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
was
obliged
to
turn
from
her
,
in
the
middle
of
her
story
,
to
*NL*
receive
the
rest
of
the
party
;
Lady
Middleton
introduced
the
two
*NL*
strangers
;
Mrs.
Dashwood
and
Margaret
came
down
stairs
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
and
they
all
sat
down
to
look
at
one
another
,
while
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
continued
her
story
as
she
walked
through
the
passage
into
the
parlour
,
*NL*
attended
by
Sir
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Palmer
was
several
years
younger
than
Lady
Middleton
,
and
totally
*NL*
unlike
her
in
every
respect
.
She
was
short
and
plump
,
had
a
very
*NL*
pretty
face
,
and
the
finest
expression
of
good
humour
in
it
that
could
*NL*
possibly
be
.
Her
manners
were
by
no
means
so
elegant
as
her
sister
's
,
*NL*
but
they
were
much
more
prepossessing
.
She
came
in
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
smiled
all
the
time
of
her
visit
,
except
when
she
laughed
,
and
smiled
*NL*
when
she
went
away
.
Her
husband
was
a
grave
looking
young
man
of
five
*NL*
or
six
and
twenty
,
with
an
air
of
more
fashion
and
sense
than
his
wife
,
*NL*
but
of
less
willingness
to
please
or
be
pleased
.
He
entered
the
room
*NL*
with
a
look
of
self-consequence
,
slightly
bowed
to
the
ladies
,
without
*NL*
speaking
a
word
,
and
,
after
briefly
surveying
them
and
their
*NL*
apartments
,
took
up
a
newspaper
from
the
table
,
and
continued
to
read
*NL*
it
as
long
as
he
staid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Palmer
,
on
the
contrary
,
who
was
strongly
endowed
by
nature
with
a
*NL*
turn
for
being
uniformly
civil
and
happy
,
was
hardly
seated
before
her
*NL*
admiration
of
the
parlour
and
every
thing
in
it
burst
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
what
a
delightful
room
this
is
!
I
never
saw
anything
so
*NL*
charming
!
Only
think
,
Mama
,
how
it
is
improved
since
I
was
here
last
!
*NL*
I
always
thought
it
such
a
sweet
place
,
ma'am
!
-LRB-
turning
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashwood
-RRB-
but
you
have
made
it
so
charming
!
Only
look
,
sister
,
how
*NL*
delightful
every
thing
is
!
How
I
should
like
such
a
house
for
myself
!
*NL*
Should
not
you
,
Mr.
Palmer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Palmer
made
her
no
answer
,
and
did
not
even
raise
his
eyes
from
the
*NL*
newspaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Palmer
does
not
hear
me
,
''
said
she
,
laughing
;
``
he
never
does
*NL*
sometimes
.
It
is
so
ridiculous
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
quite
a
new
idea
to
Mrs.
Dashwood
;
she
had
never
been
used
to
*NL*
find
wit
in
the
inattention
of
any
one
,
and
could
not
help
looking
with
*NL*
surprise
at
them
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
,
in
the
meantime
,
talked
on
as
loud
as
she
could
,
and
*NL*
continued
her
account
of
their
surprise
,
the
evening
before
,
on
seeing
*NL*
their
friends
,
without
ceasing
till
every
thing
was
told
.
Mrs.
Palmer
*NL*
laughed
heartily
at
the
recollection
of
their
astonishment
,
and
every
*NL*
body
agreed
,
two
or
three
times
over
,
that
it
had
been
quite
an
*NL*
agreeable
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
believe
how
glad
we
all
were
to
see
them
,
''
added
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
,
leaning
forward
towards
Elinor
,
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
*NL*
as
if
she
meant
to
be
heard
by
no
one
else
,
though
they
were
seated
on
*NL*
different
sides
of
the
room
;
``
but
,
however
,
I
ca
n't
help
wishing
they
*NL*
had
not
travelled
quite
so
fast
,
nor
made
such
a
long
journey
of
it
,
*NL*
for
they
came
all
round
by
London
upon
account
of
some
business
,
for
*NL*
you
know
-LRB-
nodding
significantly
and
pointing
to
her
daughter
-RRB-
it
was
*NL*
wrong
in
her
situation
.
I
wanted
her
to
stay
at
home
and
rest
this
*NL*
morning
,
but
she
would
come
with
us
;
she
longed
so
much
to
see
you
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Palmer
laughed
,
and
said
it
would
not
do
her
any
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
expects
to
be
confined
in
February
,
''
continued
Mrs.
Jennings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Middleton
could
no
longer
endure
such
a
conversation
,
and
*NL*
therefore
exerted
herself
to
ask
Mr.
Palmer
if
there
was
any
news
in
*NL*
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
none
at
all
,
''
he
replied
,
and
read
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
comes
Marianne
,
''
cried
Sir
John
.
``
Now
,
Palmer
,
you
shall
see
a
*NL*
monstrous
pretty
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
immediately
went
into
the
passage
,
opened
the
front
door
,
and
*NL*
ushered
her
in
himself
.
Mrs.
Jennings
asked
her
,
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
appeared
,
if
she
had
not
been
to
Allenham
;
and
Mrs.
Palmer
laughed
so
*NL*
heartily
at
the
question
,
as
to
show
she
understood
it
.
Mr.
Palmer
*NL*
looked
up
on
her
entering
the
room
,
stared
at
her
some
minutes
,
and
*NL*
then
returned
to
his
newspaper
.
Mrs.
Palmer
's
eye
was
now
caught
by
*NL*
the
drawings
which
hung
round
the
room
.
She
got
up
to
examine
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
dear
,
how
beautiful
these
are
!
Well
!
how
delightful
!
Do
but
*NL*
look
,
mama
,
how
sweet
!
I
declare
they
are
quite
charming
;
I
could
look
*NL*
at
them
for
ever
.
''
And
then
sitting
down
again
,
she
very
soon
forgot
*NL*
that
there
were
any
such
things
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Lady
Middleton
rose
to
go
away
,
Mr.
Palmer
rose
also
,
laid
down
*NL*
the
newspaper
,
stretched
himself
and
looked
at
them
all
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
,
have
you
been
asleep
?
''
said
his
wife
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
her
no
answer
;
and
only
observed
,
after
again
examining
the
*NL*
room
,
that
it
was
very
low
pitched
,
and
that
the
ceiling
was
crooked
.
*NL*
He
then
made
his
bow
,
and
departed
with
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
John
had
been
very
urgent
with
them
all
to
spend
the
next
day
at
*NL*
the
park
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
who
did
not
chuse
to
dine
with
them
oftener
*NL*
than
they
dined
at
the
cottage
,
absolutely
refused
on
her
own
account
;
*NL*
her
daughters
might
do
as
they
pleased
.
But
they
had
no
curiosity
to
*NL*
see
how
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Palmer
ate
their
dinner
,
and
no
expectation
of
*NL*
pleasure
from
them
in
any
other
way
.
They
attempted
,
therefore
,
*NL*
likewise
,
to
excuse
themselves
;
the
weather
was
uncertain
,
and
not
*NL*
likely
to
be
good
.
But
Sir
John
would
not
be
satisfied
--
the
carriage
*NL*
should
be
sent
for
them
and
they
must
come
.
Lady
Middleton
too
,
though
*NL*
she
did
not
press
their
mother
,
pressed
them
.
Mrs.
Jennings
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Palmer
joined
their
entreaties
,
all
seemed
equally
anxious
to
avoid
a
*NL*
family
party
;
and
the
young
ladies
were
obliged
to
yield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
they
ask
us
?
''
said
Marianne
,
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
.
*NL*
``
The
rent
of
this
cottage
is
said
to
be
low
;
but
we
have
it
on
very
*NL*
hard
terms
,
if
we
are
to
dine
at
the
park
whenever
any
one
is
staying
*NL*
either
with
them
,
or
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
mean
no
less
to
be
civil
and
kind
to
us
now
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
by
*NL*
these
frequent
invitations
,
than
by
those
which
we
received
from
them
a
*NL*
few
weeks
ago
.
The
alteration
is
not
in
them
,
if
their
parties
are
*NL*
grown
tedious
and
dull
.
We
must
look
for
the
change
elsewhere
.

CHAPTER
20
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Miss
Dashwoods
entered
the
drawing-room
of
the
park
the
next
*NL*
day
,
at
one
door
,
Mrs.
Palmer
came
running
in
at
the
other
,
looking
as
*NL*
good
humoured
and
merry
as
before
.
She
took
them
all
most
*NL*
affectionately
by
the
hand
,
and
expressed
great
delight
in
seeing
them
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
!
''
said
she
,
seating
herself
between
Elinor
and
*NL*
Marianne
,
``
for
it
is
so
bad
a
day
I
was
afraid
you
might
not
come
,
*NL*
which
would
be
a
shocking
thing
,
as
we
go
away
again
tomorrow
.
We
must
*NL*
go
,
for
the
Westons
come
to
us
next
week
you
know
.
It
was
quite
a
*NL*
sudden
thing
our
coming
at
all
,
and
I
knew
nothing
of
it
till
the
*NL*
carriage
was
coming
to
the
door
,
and
then
Mr.
Palmer
asked
me
if
I
*NL*
would
go
with
him
to
Barton
.
He
is
so
droll
!
He
never
tells
me
any
*NL*
thing
!
I
am
so
sorry
we
can
not
stay
longer
;
however
we
shall
meet
again
*NL*
in
town
very
soon
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
obliged
to
put
an
end
to
such
an
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
go
to
town
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Palmer
,
with
a
laugh
,
``
I
shall
be
quite
*NL*
disappointed
if
you
do
not
.
I
could
get
the
nicest
house
in
the
world
for
*NL*
you
,
next
door
to
ours
,
in
Hanover-square
.
You
must
come
,
indeed
.
I
*NL*
am
sure
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
chaperon
you
at
any
time
till
I
am
*NL*
confined
,
if
Mrs.
Dashwood
should
not
like
to
go
into
public
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
thanked
her
;
but
were
obliged
to
resist
all
her
entreaties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
love
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Palmer
to
her
husband
,
who
just
then
entered
*NL*
the
room
--
``
you
must
help
me
to
persuade
the
Miss
Dashwoods
to
go
to
*NL*
town
this
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
love
made
no
answer
;
and
after
slightly
bowing
to
the
ladies
,
began
*NL*
complaining
of
the
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
horrid
all
this
is
!
''
said
he
.
``
Such
weather
makes
every
thing
and
*NL*
every
body
disgusting
.
Dullness
is
as
much
produced
within
doors
as
*NL*
without
,
by
rain
.
It
makes
one
detest
all
one
's
acquaintance
.
What
*NL*
the
devil
does
Sir
John
mean
by
not
having
a
billiard
room
in
his
*NL*
house
?
How
few
people
know
what
comfort
is
!
Sir
John
is
as
stupid
as
*NL*
the
weather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
company
soon
dropt
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
Miss
Marianne
,
''
said
Sir
John
,
``
you
have
not
been
able
to
*NL*
take
your
usual
walk
to
Allenham
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
looked
very
grave
and
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
be
so
sly
before
us
,
''
said
Mrs.
Palmer
;
``
for
we
know
all
*NL*
about
it
,
I
assure
you
;
and
I
admire
your
taste
very
much
,
for
I
think
*NL*
he
is
extremely
handsome
.
We
do
not
live
a
great
way
from
him
in
the
*NL*
country
,
you
know
.
Not
above
ten
miles
,
I
dare
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
nearer
thirty
,
''
said
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
!
there
is
not
much
difference
.
I
never
was
at
his
house
;
but
*NL*
they
say
it
is
a
sweet
pretty
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
vile
a
spot
as
I
ever
saw
in
my
life
,
''
said
Mr.
Palmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
remained
perfectly
silent
,
though
her
countenance
betrayed
her
*NL*
interest
in
what
was
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
very
ugly
?
''
continued
Mrs.
Palmer
--
``
then
it
must
be
some
other
*NL*
place
that
is
so
pretty
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
seated
in
the
dining
room
,
Sir
John
observed
with
regret
*NL*
that
they
were
only
eight
all
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
he
to
his
lady
,
``
it
is
very
provoking
that
we
should
be
*NL*
so
few
.
Why
did
not
you
ask
the
Gilberts
to
come
to
us
today
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
not
I
tell
you
,
Sir
John
,
when
you
spoke
to
me
about
it
before
,
*NL*
that
it
could
not
be
done
?
They
dined
with
us
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
and
I
,
Sir
John
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jennings
,
``
should
not
stand
upon
such
*NL*
ceremony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
would
be
very
ill-bred
,
''
cried
Mr.
Palmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
you
contradict
every
body
,
''
said
his
wife
with
her
usual
*NL*
laugh
.
``
Do
you
know
that
you
are
quite
rude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
I
contradicted
any
body
in
calling
your
mother
*NL*
ill-bred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
you
may
abuse
me
as
you
please
,
''
said
the
good-natured
old
lady
,
*NL*
``
you
have
taken
Charlotte
off
my
hands
,
and
can
not
give
her
back
again
.
*NL*
So
there
I
have
the
whip
hand
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charlotte
laughed
heartily
to
think
that
her
husband
could
not
get
rid
*NL*
of
her
;
and
exultingly
said
,
she
did
not
care
how
cross
he
was
to
her
,
*NL*
as
they
must
live
together
.
It
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
be
more
*NL*
thoroughly
good-natured
,
or
more
determined
to
be
happy
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Palmer
.
The
studied
indifference
,
insolence
,
and
discontent
of
her
*NL*
husband
gave
her
no
pain
;
and
when
he
scolded
or
abused
her
,
she
was
*NL*
highly
diverted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Palmer
is
so
droll
!
''
said
she
,
in
a
whisper
,
to
Elinor
.
``
He
is
*NL*
always
out
of
humour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
was
not
inclined
,
after
a
little
observation
,
to
give
him
credit
*NL*
for
being
so
genuinely
and
unaffectedly
ill-natured
or
ill-bred
as
he
*NL*
wished
to
appear
.
His
temper
might
perhaps
be
a
little
soured
by
*NL*
finding
,
like
many
others
of
his
sex
,
that
through
some
unaccountable
*NL*
bias
in
favour
of
beauty
,
he
was
the
husband
of
a
very
silly
*NL*
woman
,
--
but
she
knew
that
this
kind
of
blunder
was
too
common
for
any
*NL*
sensible
man
to
be
lastingly
hurt
by
it
.
--
It
was
rather
a
wish
of
*NL*
distinction
,
she
believed
,
which
produced
his
contemptuous
treatment
of
*NL*
every
body
,
and
his
general
abuse
of
every
thing
before
him
.
It
was
*NL*
the
desire
of
appearing
superior
to
other
people
.
The
motive
was
too
*NL*
common
to
be
wondered
at
;
but
the
means
,
however
they
might
succeed
by
*NL*
establishing
his
superiority
in
ill-breeding
,
were
not
likely
to
attach
*NL*
any
one
to
him
except
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
Miss
Dashwood
,
''
said
Mrs.
Palmer
soon
afterwards
,
``
I
have
*NL*
got
such
a
favour
to
ask
of
you
and
your
sister
.
Will
you
come
and
*NL*
spend
some
time
at
Cleveland
this
Christmas
?
Now
,
pray
do
,
--
and
come
*NL*
while
the
Westons
are
with
us
.
You
can
not
think
how
happy
I
shall
be
!
*NL*
It
will
be
quite
delightful
!

My
love

''
applying
to
her
husband
,
``
do
n't
*NL*
you
long
to
have
the
Miss
Dashwoods
come
to
Cleveland
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
he
replied
,
with
a
sneer
--
``
I
came
into
Devonshire
with
no
*NL*
other
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
''
--
said
his
lady
,
``
you
see
Mr.
Palmer
expects
you
;
so
you
*NL*
can
not
refuse
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
eagerly
and
resolutely
declined
her
invitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
indeed
you
must
and
shall
come
.
I
am
sure
you
will
like
it
of
all
*NL*
things
.
The
Westons
will
be
with
us
,
and
it
will
be
quite
delightful
.
*NL*
You
can
not
think
what
a
sweet
place
Cleveland
is
;
and
we
are
so
gay
*NL*
now
,
for
Mr.
Palmer
is
always
going
about
the
country
canvassing
*NL*
against
the
election
;
and
so
many
people
came
to
dine
with
us
that
I
*NL*
never
saw
before
,
it
is
quite
charming
!
But
,
poor
fellow
!
it
is
very
*NL*
fatiguing
to
him
!
for
he
is
forced
to
make
every
body
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
hardly
keep
her
countenance
as
she
assented
to
the
*NL*
hardship
of
such
an
obligation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
charming
it
will
be
,
''
said
Charlotte
,
``
when
he
is
in
*NL*
Parliament
!
--
wo
n't
it
?
How
I
shall
laugh
!
It
will
be
so
ridiculous
to
*NL*
see
all
his
letters
directed
to
him
with
an
M.P.
--
But
do
you
know
,
he
*NL*
says
,
he
will
never
frank
for
me
?
He
declares
he
wo
n't
.
Do
n't
you
,
*NL*
Mr.
Palmer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Palmer
took
no
notice
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
can
not
bear
writing
,
you
know
,
''
she
continued
--
``
he
says
it
is
quite
*NL*
shocking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
never
said
any
thing
so
irrational

all

your
abuses
of
languages
upon

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
;
you
see
how
droll

is

is
always
the
way
with
him
!
*NL*
Sometimes
he
wo
n't
speak
to
me
for
half
a
day
together
,
and
then
he
*NL*
comes
out
with
something
so
droll
--
all
about
any
thing
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
surprised
Elinor
very
much
as
they
returned
into
the
drawing-room
,
*NL*
by
asking
her
whether
she
did
not
like
Mr.
Palmer
excessively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Elinor
;
``
he
seems
very
agreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
am
so
glad
you
do
.
I
thought
you
would
,
he
is
so
pleasant
;
*NL*
and
Mr.
Palmer
is
excessively
pleased
with
you
and
your
sisters
I
can
*NL*
tell
you
,

you
ca
n't
think
how
disappointed
he
will
be
if
you
do
n't
*NL*
come
to
Cleveland
.
--
I
ca
n't
imagine
why
you
should
object
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
was
again
obliged
to
decline
her
invitation
;
and
by
changing
the
*NL*
subject
,
put
a
stop
to
her
entreaties
.
She
thought
it
probable
that
as
*NL*
they
lived
in
the
same
county
,
Mrs.
Palmer
might
be
able
to
give
some
*NL*
more
particular
account
of
Willoughby
's
general
character
,
than
could
*NL*
be
gathered
from
the
Middletons
'
partial
acquaintance
with
him
;
and
she
*NL*
was
eager
to
gain
from
any
one
,
such
a
confirmation
of
his
merits
as
*NL*
might
remove
the
possibility
of
fear
from
Marianne
.
She
began
by
*NL*
inquiring
if
they
saw
much
of
Mr.
Willoughby
at
Cleveland
,
and
whether
*NL*
they
were
intimately
acquainted
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
;
I
know
him
extremely
well
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Palmer
;
--
``
Not
*NL*
that
I
ever
spoke
to
him
,
indeed
;
but
I
have
seen
him
for
ever
in
town
.
*NL*
Somehow
or
other
I
never
happened
to
be
staying
at
Barton
while
he
was
*NL*
at
Allenham
.
Mama
saw
him
here
once
before
;
--
but
I
was
with
my
uncle
*NL*
at
Weymouth
.
However
,
I
dare
say
we
should
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
him
in
Somersetshire
,
if
it
had
not
happened
very
unluckily
that
we
*NL*
should
never
have
been
in
the
country
together
.
He
is
very
little
at
*NL*
Combe
,
I
believe
;
but
if
he
were
ever
so
much
there
,
I
do
not
think
Mr.
*NL*
Palmer
would
visit
him
,
for
he
is
in
the
opposition
,
you
know
,
and
*NL*
besides
it
is
such
a
way
off
.
I
know
why
you
inquire
about
him
,
very
*NL*
well
;
your
sister
is
to
marry
him
.
I
am
monstrous
glad
of
it
,
for
then
*NL*
I
shall
have
her
for
a
neighbour
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
you
know
much
more
of
the
matter
than
*NL*
I
do
,
if
you
have
any
reason
to
expect
such
a
match
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
pretend
to
deny
it
,
because
you
know
it
is
what
every
body
talks
*NL*
of
.
I
assure
you
I
heard
of
it
in
my
way
through
town
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Mrs.
Palmer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
honour
I
did
.

I
met
Colonel
Brandon
Monday
morning
in
*NL*
Bond-street
,
just
before
we
left
town
,
and
he
told
me
of
it
directly
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
surprise
me
very
much

Colonel
Brandon
tell
you
of
it

Surely
*NL*
you
must
be
mistaken

To
give
such
intelligence
to
a
person
who
could
*NL*
not
be
interested
in
it
,
even
if
it
were
true
,
is
not
what
I
should
*NL*
expect
Colonel
Brandon
to
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
assure
you
it
was
so
,
for
all
that
,
and
I
will
tell
you
how
*NL*
it
happened
.
When
we
met
him
,
he
turned
back
and
walked
with
us
;
and
*NL*
so
we
began
talking
of
my
brother
and
sister
,
and
one
thing
and
*NL*
another
,
and
I
said
to
him
,
`
So
,
Colonel
,
there
is
a
new
family
come
to
*NL*
Barton
cottage
,
I
hear
,
and
mama
sends
me
word
they
are
very
pretty
,
*NL*
and
that
one
of
them
is
going
to
be
married
to
Mr.
Willoughby
of
Combe
*NL*
Magna
.
Is
it
true
,
pray
?
for
of
course
you
must
know
,
as
you
have
been
*NL*
in
Devonshire
so
lately
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
the
Colonel
say
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

he
did
not
say
much
;
but
he
looked
as
if
he
knew
it
to
be
true
,
so
*NL*
from
that
moment
I
set
it
down
as
certain
.
It
will
be
quite
*NL*
delightful
,
I
declare
!
When
is
it
to
take
place
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

was
very
well

*NL*
``
Oh

quite
well

so
full
of

nothing

fine
things
of
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
flattered

him
uncommonly
pleasing

*NL*
*NL*

So
do
I.

such
a
charming

that
it

quite
a

grave

dull

Mama
says
HE
was
in
love
with
your

I
assure
you
it
was
a
great
compliment

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is

Elinor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

extremely
well

extremely
agreeable

Nobody

more
liked

wherever

you

a
monstrous
lucky

get
him

upon
my
honour

not

that

much
more
lucky
in
getting

However

I

both

pretty

it

Mrs.

information
respecting
Willoughby
was
not

any

21
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Palmers
returned
to
Cleveland
the
next
day
,
and
the
two
families
at
*NL*
Barton
were
again
left
to
entertain
each
other
.
But
this
did
not
last
*NL*
long
;
Elinor
had
hardly
got
their
last
visitors
out
of
her
head
,
had
*NL*
hardly
done
wondering
at
Charlotte
's
being
so
happy
without
a
cause
,
at
*NL*
Mr.
Palmer
's
acting
so
simply
,
with
good
abilities
,
and
at
the
strange
*NL*
unsuitableness
which
often
existed
between
husband
and
wife
,
before
Sir
*NL*
John
's
and
Mrs.
Jennings
's
active
zeal
in
the
cause
of
society
,
*NL*
procured
her
some
other
new
acquaintance
to
see
and
observe
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
morning
's
excursion
to
Exeter
,
they
had
met
with
two
young
ladies
,
*NL*
whom
Mrs.
Jennings
had
the
satisfaction
of
discovering
to
be
her
*NL*
relations
,
and
this
was
enough
for
Sir
John
to
invite
them
directly
to
*NL*
the
park
,
as
soon
as
their
present
engagements
at
Exeter
were
over
.
*NL*
Their
engagements
at
Exeter
instantly
gave
way
before
such
an
*NL*
invitation
,
and
Lady
Middleton
was
thrown
into
no
little
alarm
on
the
*NL*
return
of
Sir
John
,
by
hearing
that
she
was
very
soon
to
receive
a
*NL*
visit
from
two
girls
whom
she
had
never
seen
in
her
life
,
and
of
whose
*NL*
elegance
,
--
whose
tolerable
gentility
even
,
she
could
have
no
proof
;
for
*NL*
the
assurances
of
her
husband
and
mother
on
that
subject
went
for
*NL*
nothing
at
all
.
Their
being
her
relations
too
made
it
so
much
the
*NL*
worse
;
and
Mrs.
Jennings
's
attempts
at
consolation
were
therefore
*NL*
unfortunately
founded
,
when
she
advised
her
daughter
not
to
care
about
*NL*
their
being
so
fashionable
;
because
they
were
all
cousins
and
must
put
*NL*
up
with
one
another
.
As
it
was
impossible
,
however
,
now
to
prevent
*NL*
their
coming
,
Lady
Middleton
resigned
herself
to
the
idea
of
it
,
with
*NL*
all
the
philosophy
of
a
well-bred
woman
,
contenting
herself
with
merely
*NL*
giving
her
husband
a
gentle
reprimand
on
the
subject
five
or
six
times
*NL*
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
ladies
arrived
:
their
appearance
was
by
no
means
ungenteel
or
*NL*
unfashionable
.
Their
dress
was
very
smart
,
their
manners
very
civil
,
*NL*
they
were
delighted
with
the
house
,
and
in
raptures
with
the
furniture
,
*NL*
and
they
happened
to
be
so
doatingly
fond
of
children
that
Lady
*NL*
Middleton
's
good
opinion
was
engaged
in
their
favour
before
they
had
*NL*
been
an
hour
at
the
Park
.
She
declared
them
to
be
very
agreeable
girls
*NL*
indeed
,
which
for
her
ladyship
was
enthusiastic
admiration
.
Sir
John
's
*NL*
confidence
in
his
own
judgment
rose
with
this
animated
praise
,
and
he
*NL*
set
off
directly
for
the
cottage
to
tell
the
Miss
Dashwoods
of
the
Miss
*NL*
Steeles
'
arrival
,
and
to
assure
them
of
their
being
the
sweetest
girls
*NL*
in
the
world
.
From
such
commendation
as
this
,
however
,
there
was
not
*NL*
much
to
be
learned
;
Elinor
well
knew
that
the
sweetest
girls
in
the
*NL*
world
were
to
be
met
with
in
every
part
of
England
,
under
every
*NL*
possible
variation
of
form
,
face
,
temper
and
understanding
.
Sir
John
*NL*
wanted
the
whole
family
to
walk
to
the
Park
directly
and
look
at
his
*NL*
guests
.
Benevolent
,
philanthropic
man
!
It
was
painful
to
him
even
to
*NL*
keep
a
third
cousin
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
come
now
,
''
said
he
--
``
pray
come
--
you
must
come
--
I
declare
you
shall
*NL*
come
--
You
ca
n't
think
how
you
will
like
them
.
Lucy
is
monstrous
*NL*
pretty
,
and
so
good
humoured
and
agreeable
!
The
children
are
all
*NL*
hanging
about
her
already
,
as
if
she
was
an
old
acquaintance
.
And
they
*NL*
both
long
to
see
you
of
all
things
,
for
they
have
heard
at
Exeter
that
*NL*
you
are
the
most
beautiful
creatures
in
the
world
;
and
I
have
told
them
*NL*
it
is
all
very
true
,
and
a
great
deal
more
.
You
will
be
delighted
with
*NL*
them
I
am
sure
.
They
have
brought
the
whole
coach
full
of
playthings
*NL*
for
the
children
.
How
can
you
be
so
cross
as
not
to
come
?
Why
they
*NL*
are
your
cousins
,
you
know
,
after
a
fashion
.
YOU
are
my
cousins
,
and
*NL*
they
are
my
wife
's
,
so
you
must
be
related
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Sir
John
could
not
prevail
.
He
could
only
obtain
a
promise
of
*NL*
their
calling
at
the
Park
within
a
day
or
two
,
and
then
left
them
in
*NL*
amazement
at
their
indifference
,
to
walk
home
and
boast
anew
of
their
*NL*
attractions
to
the
Miss
Steeles
,
as
he
had
been
already
boasting
of
the
*NL*
Miss
Steeles
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
their
promised
visit
to
the
Park
and
consequent
introduction
to
*NL*
these
young
ladies
took
place
,
they
found
in
the
appearance
of
the
*NL*
eldest
,
who
was
nearly
thirty
,
with
a
very
plain
and
not
a
sensible
*NL*
face
,
nothing
to
admire
;
but
in
the
other
,
who
was
not
more
than
two
or
*NL*
three
and
twenty
,
they
acknowledged
considerable
beauty
;
her
features
*NL*
were
pretty
,
and
she
had
a
sharp
quick
eye
,
and
a
smartness
of
air
,
*NL*
which
though
it
did
not
give
actual
elegance
or
grace
,
gave
distinction
*NL*
to
her
person
.
--
Their
manners
were
particularly
civil
,
and
Elinor
soon
*NL*
allowed
them
credit
for
some
kind
of
sense
,
when
she
saw
with
what
*NL*
constant
and
judicious
attention
they
were
making
themselves
agreeable
*NL*
to
Lady
Middleton
.
With
her
children
they
were
in
continual
raptures
,
*NL*
extolling
their
beauty
,
courting
their
notice
,
and
humouring
their
*NL*
whims
;
and
such
of
their
time
as
could
be
spared
from
the
importunate
*NL*
demands
which
this
politeness
made
on
it
,
was
spent
in
admiration
of
*NL*
whatever
her
ladyship
was
doing
,
if
she
happened
to
be
doing
any
thing
,
*NL*
or
in
taking
patterns
of
some
elegant
new
dress
,
in
which
her
*NL*
appearance
the
day
before
had
thrown
them
into
unceasing
delight
.
*NL*
Fortunately
for
those
who
pay
their
court
through
such
foibles
,
a
fond
*NL*
mother
,
though
,
in
pursuit
of
praise
for
her
children
,
the
most
*NL*
rapacious
of
human
beings
,
is
likewise
the
most
credulous
;
her
demands
*NL*
are
exorbitant
;
but
she
will
swallow
any
thing
;
and
the
excessive
*NL*
affection
and
endurance
of
the
Miss
Steeles
towards
her
offspring
were
*NL*
viewed
therefore
by
Lady
Middleton
without
the
smallest
surprise
or
*NL*
distrust
.
She
saw
with
maternal
complacency
all
the
impertinent
*NL*
encroachments
and
mischievous
tricks
to
which
her
cousins
submitted
.
*NL*
She
saw
their
sashes
untied
,
their
hair
pulled
about
their
ears
,
their
*NL*
work-bags
searched
,
and
their
knives
and
scissors
stolen
away
,
and
felt
*NL*
no
doubt
of
its
being
a
reciprocal
enjoyment
.
It
suggested
no
other
*NL*
surprise
than
that
Elinor
and
Marianne
should
sit
so
composedly
by
,
*NL*
without
claiming
a
share
in
what
was
passing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
John
is
in
such
spirits
today
!
''
said
she
,
on
his
taking
Miss
Steeles
's
*NL*
pocket
handkerchief
,
and
throwing
it
out
of
window
--
``
He
is
full
of
*NL*
monkey
tricks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
soon
afterwards
,
on
the
second
boy
's
violently
pinching
one
of
the
*NL*
same
lady
's
fingers
,
she
fondly
observed
,
``
How
playful
William
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
is
my
sweet
little
Annamaria
,
''
she
added
,
tenderly
caressing
*NL*
a
little
girl
of
three
years
old
,
who
had
not
made
a
noise
for
the
last
*NL*
two
minutes
;
``
And
she
is
always
so
gentle
and
quiet
--
Never
was
there
*NL*
such
a
quiet
little
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
unfortunately
in
bestowing
these
embraces
,
a
pin
in
her
ladyship
's
*NL*
head
dress
slightly
scratching
the
child
's
neck
,
produced
from
this
*NL*
pattern
of
gentleness
such
violent
screams
,
as
could
hardly
be
outdone
*NL*
by
any
creature
professedly
noisy
.
The
mother
's
consternation
was
*NL*
excessive
;
but
it
could
not
surpass
the
alarm
of
the
Miss
Steeles
,
and
*NL*
every
thing
was
done
by
all
three
,
in
so
critical
an
emergency
,
which
*NL*
affection
could
suggest
as
likely
to
assuage
the
agonies
of
the
little
*NL*
sufferer
.
She
was
seated
in
her
mother
's
lap
,
covered
with
kisses
,
her
*NL*
wound
bathed
with
lavender-water
,
by
one
of
the
Miss
Steeles
,
who
was
*NL*
on
her
knees
to
attend
her
,
and
her
mouth
stuffed
with
sugar
plums
by
*NL*
the
other
.
With
such
a
reward
for
her
tears
,
the
child
was
too
wise
to
*NL*
cease
crying
.
She
still
screamed
and
sobbed
lustily
,
kicked
her
two
*NL*
brothers
for
offering
to
touch
her
,
and
all
their
united
soothings
were
*NL*
ineffectual
till
Lady
Middleton
luckily
remembering
that
in
a
scene
of
*NL*
similar
distress
last
week
,
some
apricot
marmalade
had
been
*NL*
successfully
applied
for
a
bruised
temple
,
the
same
remedy
was
eagerly
*NL*
proposed
for
this
unfortunate
scratch
,
and
a
slight
intermission
of
*NL*
screams
in
the
young
lady
on
hearing
it
,
gave
them
reason
to
hope
that
*NL*
it
would
not
be
rejected
.
--
She
was
carried
out
of
the
room
therefore
*NL*
in
her
mother
's
arms
,
in
quest
of
this
medicine
,
and
as
the
two
boys
*NL*
chose
to
follow
,
though
earnestly
entreated
by
their
mother
to
stay
*NL*
behind
,
the
four
young
ladies
were
left
in
a
quietness
which
the
room
*NL*
had
not
known
for
many
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
creatures
!
''
said
Miss
Steele
,
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
.
*NL*
``
It
might
have
been
a
very
sad
accident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
hardly
know
how
,
''
cried
Marianne
,
``
unless
it
had
been
under
*NL*
totally
different
circumstances
.
But
this
is
the
usual
way
of
*NL*
heightening
alarm
,
where
there
is
nothing
to
be
alarmed
at
in
reality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
sweet
woman
Lady
Middleton
is
!
''
said
Lucy
Steele
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
was
silent
;
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
say
what
she
did
not
*NL*
feel
,
however
trivial
the
occasion
;
and
upon
Elinor
therefore
the
whole
*NL*
task
of
telling
lies
when
politeness
required
it
,
always
fell
.
She
did
*NL*
her
best
when
thus
called
on
,
by
speaking
of
Lady
Middleton
with
more
*NL*
warmth
than
she
felt
,
though
with
far
less
than
Miss
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Sir
John
too
,
''
cried
the
elder
sister
,
``
what
a
charming
man
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
too
,
Miss
Dashwood
's
commendation
,
being
only
simple
and
just
,
*NL*
came
in
without
any
eclat
.
She
merely
observed
that
he
was
perfectly
*NL*
good
humoured
and
friendly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
a
charming
little
family
they
have
!
I
never
saw
such
fine
*NL*
children
in
my
life
.
--
I
declare
I
quite
doat
upon
them
already
,
and
*NL*
indeed
I
am
always
distractedly
fond
of
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
guess
so
,
''
said
Elinor
,
with
a
smile
,
``
from
what
I
have
*NL*
witnessed
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
notion
,
''
said
Lucy
,
``
you
think
the
little
Middletons
rather
*NL*
too
much
indulged
;
perhaps
they
may
be
the
outside
of
enough
;
but
it
is
*NL*
so
natural
in
Lady
Middleton
;
and
for
my
part
,
I
love
to
see
children
*NL*
full
of
life
and
spirits
;
I
can
not
bear
them
if
they
are
tame
and
*NL*
quiet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
that
while
I
am
at
Barton
Park
,
I
never
*NL*
think
of
tame
and
quiet
children
with
any
abhorrence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
pause
succeeded
this
speech
,
which
was
first
broken
by
Miss
*NL*
Steele
,
who
seemed
very
much
disposed
for
conversation
,
and
who
now
*NL*
said
rather
abruptly
,
``
And
how
do
you
like
Devonshire
,
Miss
Dashwood
?
*NL*
I
suppose
you
were
very
sorry
to
leave
Sussex
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
some
surprise
at
the
familiarity
of
this
question
,
or
at
least
of
*NL*
the
manner
in
which
it
was
spoken
,
Elinor
replied
that
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Norland
is
a
prodigious
beautiful
place
,
is
not
it
?
''
added
Miss
Steele
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
heard
Sir
John
admire
it
excessively
,
''
said
Lucy
,
who
seemed
*NL*
to
think
some
apology
necessary
for
the
freedom
of
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
every
one
MUST
admire
it
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
who
ever
saw
the
*NL*
place
;
though
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
one
can
estimate
its
*NL*
beauties
as
we
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
had
you
a
great
many
smart
beaux
there
?
I
suppose
you
have
not
so
*NL*
many
in
this
part
of
the
world
;
for
my
part
,
I
think
they
are
a
vast
*NL*
addition
always
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
you
think
,
''
said
Lucy
,
looking
ashamed
of
her
sister
,
*NL*
``
that
there
are
not
as
many
genteel
young
men
in
Devonshire
as
Sussex
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
my
dear
,
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
pretend
to
say
that
there
a
n't
.
I
'm
*NL*
sure
there
's
a
vast
many
smart
beaux
in
Exeter
;
but
you
know
,
how
could
*NL*
I
tell
what
smart
beaux
there
might
be
about
Norland
;
and
I
was
only
*NL*
afraid
the
Miss
Dashwoods
might
find
it
dull
at
Barton
,
if
they
had
not
*NL*
so
many
as
they
used
to
have
.
But
perhaps
you
young
ladies
may
not
*NL*
care
about
the
beaux
,
and
had
as
lief
be
without
them
as
with
them
.
*NL*
For
my
part
,
I
think
they
are
vastly
agreeable
,
provided
they
dress
*NL*
smart
and
behave
civil
.
But
I
ca
n't
bear
to
see
them
dirty
and
nasty
.
*NL*
Now
there
's
Mr.
Rose
at
Exeter
,
a
prodigious
smart
young
man
,
quite
a
*NL*
beau
,
clerk
to
Mr.
Simpson
,
you
know
,
and
yet
if
you
do
but
meet
him
of
*NL*
a
morning
,
he
is
not
fit
to
be
seen
.
--
I
suppose
your
brother
was
quite
*NL*
a
beau
,
Miss
Dashwood
,
before
he
married
,
as
he
was
so
rich
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
I
can
not
tell
you
,
for
I
do
not
*NL*
perfectly
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
word
.
But
this
I
can
say
,
that
*NL*
if
he
ever
was
a
beau
before
he
married
,
he
is
one
still
for
there
is
*NL*
not
the
smallest
alteration
in
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
dear
!
one
never
thinks
of
married
men
's
being
beaux
--
they
have
*NL*
something
else
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
!
Anne
,
''
cried
her
sister
,
``
you
can
talk
of
nothing
but
*NL*
beaux
;
--
you
will
make
Miss
Dashwood
believe
you
think
of
nothing
else
.
''
*NL*
And
then
to
turn
the
discourse
,
she
began
admiring
the
house
and
the
*NL*
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
specimen
of
the
Miss
Steeles
was
enough
.
The
vulgar
freedom
and
*NL*
folly
of
the
eldest
left
her
no
recommendation
,
and
as
Elinor
was
not
*NL*
blinded
by
the
beauty
,
or
the
shrewd
look
of
the
youngest
,
to
her
want
*NL*
of
real
elegance
and
artlessness
,
she
left
the
house
without
any
wish
*NL*
of
knowing
them
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
so
the
Miss
Steeles
.
--
They
came
from
Exeter
,
well
provided
with
*NL*
admiration
for
the
use
of
Sir
John
Middleton
,
his
family
,
and
all
his
*NL*
relations
,
and
no
niggardly
proportion
was
now
dealt
out
to
his
fair
*NL*
cousins
,
whom
they
declared
to
be
the
most
beautiful
,
elegant
,
*NL*
accomplished
,
and
agreeable
girls
they
had
ever
beheld
,
and
with
whom
*NL*
they
were
particularly
anxious
to
be
better
acquainted
.
--
And
to
be
*NL*
better
acquainted
therefore
,
Elinor
soon
found
was
their
inevitable
*NL*
lot
,
for
as
Sir
John
was
entirely
on
the
side
of
the
Miss
Steeles
,
*NL*
their
party
would
be
too
strong
for
opposition
,
and
that
kind
of
*NL*
intimacy
must
be
submitted
to
,
which
consists
of
sitting
an
hour
or
two
*NL*
together
in
the
same
room
almost
every
day
.
Sir
John
could
do
no
more
;
*NL*
but
he
did
not
know
that
any
more
was
required
:
to
be
together
was
,
in
*NL*
his
opinion
,
to
be
intimate
,
and
while
his
continual
schemes
for
their
*NL*
meeting
were
effectual
,
he
had
not
a
doubt
of
their
being
established
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
do
him
justice
,
he
did
every
thing
in
his
power
to
promote
their
*NL*
unreserve
,
by
making
the
Miss
Steeles
acquainted
with
whatever
he
knew
*NL*
or
supposed
of
his
cousins
'
situations
in
the
most
delicate
*NL*
particulars
,
--
and
Elinor
had
not
seen
them
more
than
twice
,
before
the
*NL*
eldest
of
them
wished
her
joy
on
her
sister
's
having
been
so
lucky
as
*NL*
to
make
a
conquest
of
a
very
smart
beau
since
she
came
to
Barton
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Twill
be
a
fine
thing
to
have
her
married
so
young
to
be
sure
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
``
and
I
hear
he
is
quite
a
beau
,
and
prodigious
handsome
.
And
I
*NL*
hope
you
may
have
as
good
luck
yourself
soon
,
--
but
perhaps
you
may
have
*NL*
a
friend
in
the
corner
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
not
suppose
that
Sir
John
would
be
more
nice
in
*NL*
proclaiming
his
suspicions
of
her
regard
for
Edward
,
than
he
had
been
*NL*
with
respect
to
Marianne
;
indeed
it
was
rather
his
favourite
joke
of
*NL*
the
two
,
as
being
somewhat
newer
and
more
conjectural
;
and
since
*NL*
Edward
's
visit
,
they
had
never
dined
together
without
his
drinking
to
*NL*
her
best
affections
with
so
much
significancy
and
so
many
nods
and
*NL*
winks
,
as
to
excite
general
attention
.
The
letter
F
--
had
been
likewise
*NL*
invariably
brought
forward
,
and
found
productive
of
such
countless
*NL*
jokes
,
that
its
character
as
the
wittiest
letter
in
the
alphabet
had
*NL*
been
long
established
with
Elinor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Steeles
,
as
she
expected
,
had
now
all
the
benefit
of
these
*NL*
jokes
,
and
in
the
eldest
of
them
they
raised
a
curiosity
to
know
the
*NL*
name
of
the
gentleman
alluded
to
,
which
,
though
often
impertinently
*NL*
expressed
,
was
perfectly
of
a
piece
with
her
general
inquisitiveness
*NL*
into
the
concerns
of
their
family
.
But
Sir
John
did
not
sport
long
*NL*
with
the
curiosity
which
he
delighted
to
raise
,
for
he
had
at
least
as
*NL*
much
pleasure
in
telling
the
name
,
as
Miss
Steele
had
in
hearing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
name
is
Ferrars
,
''
said
he
,
in
a
very
audible
whisper
;
``
but
pray
do
*NL*
not
tell
it
,
for
it
's
a
great
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ferrars
!
''
repeated
Miss
Steele
;
``
Mr.
Ferrars
is
the
happy
man
,
is
he
?
*NL*
What
!
your
sister-in-law
's
brother
,
Miss
Dashwood
?
a
very
agreeable
*NL*
young
man
to
be
sure
;
I
know
him
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
say
so
,
Anne
?
''
cried
Lucy
,
who
generally
made
an
amendment
*NL*
to
all
her
sister
's
assertions
.
``
Though
we
have
seen
him
once
or
twice
*NL*
at
my
uncle
's
,
it
is
rather
too
much
to
pretend
to
know
him
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
heard
all
this
with
attention
and
surprise
.
``
And
who
was
this
*NL*
uncle
?
Where
did
he
live
?
How
came
they
acquainted
?
''
She
wished
very
*NL*
much
to
have
the
subject
continued
,
though
she
did
not
chuse
to
join
in
*NL*
it
herself
;
but
nothing
more
of
it
was
said
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
*NL*
her
life
,
she
thought
Mrs.
Jennings
deficient
either
in
curiosity
after
*NL*
petty
information
,
or
in
a
disposition
to
communicate
it
.
The
manner
*NL*
in
which
Miss
Steele
had
spoken
of
Edward
,
increased
her
curiosity
;
for
*NL*
it
struck
her
as
being
rather
ill-natured
,
and
suggested
the
suspicion
*NL*
of
that
lady
's
knowing
,
or
fancying
herself
to
know
something
to
his
*NL*
disadvantage
.
--
But
her
curiosity
was
unavailing
,
for
no
farther
notice
*NL*
was
taken
of
Mr.
Ferrars
's
name
by
Miss
Steele
when
alluded
to
,
or
even
*NL*
openly
mentioned
by
Sir
John
.

CHAPTER
22
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
,
who
had
never
much
toleration
for
any
thing
like
*NL*
impertinence
,
vulgarity
,
inferiority
of
parts
,
or
even
difference
of
*NL*
taste
from
herself
,
was
at
this
time
particularly
ill-disposed
,
from
*NL*
the
state
of
her
spirits
,
to
be
pleased
with
the
Miss
Steeles
,
or
to
*NL*
encourage
their
advances
;
and
to
the
invariable
coldness
of
her
*NL*
behaviour
towards
them
,
which
checked
every
endeavour
at
intimacy
on
*NL*
their
side
,
Elinor
principally
attributed
that
preference
of
herself
*NL*
which
soon
became
evident
in
the
manners
of
both
,
but
especially
of
*NL*
Lucy
,
who
missed
no
opportunity
of
engaging
her
in
conversation
,
or
of
*NL*
striving
to
improve
their
acquaintance
by
an
easy
and
frank
*NL*
communication
of
her
sentiments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
naturally
clever
;
her
remarks
were
often
just
and
amusing
;
and
*NL*
as
a
companion
for
half
an
hour
Elinor
frequently
found
her
agreeable
;
*NL*
but
her
powers
had
received
no
aid
from
education
:
she
was
ignorant
and
*NL*
illiterate
;
and
her
deficiency
of
all
mental
improvement
,
her
want
of
*NL*
information
in
the
most
common
particulars
,
could
not
be
concealed
from
*NL*
Miss
Dashwood
,
in
spite
of
her
constant
endeavour
to
appear
to
*NL*
advantage
.
Elinor
saw
,
and
pitied
her
for
,
the
neglect
of
abilities
*NL*
which
education
might
have
rendered
so
respectable
;
but
she
saw
,
with
*NL*
less
tenderness
of
feeling
,
the
thorough
want
of
delicacy
,
of
*NL*
rectitude
,
and
integrity
of
mind
,
which
her
attentions
,
her
*NL*
assiduities
,
her
flatteries
at
the
Park
betrayed
;
and
she
could
have
no
*NL*
lasting
satisfaction
in
the
company
of
a
person
who
joined
insincerity
*NL*
with
ignorance
;
whose
want
of
instruction
prevented
their
meeting
in
*NL*
conversation
on
terms
of
equality
,
and
whose
conduct
toward
others
made
*NL*
every
shew
of
attention
and
deference
towards
herself
perfectly
*NL*
valueless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
think
my
question
an
odd
one
,
I
dare
say
,
''
said
Lucy
to
her
*NL*
one
day
,
as
they
were
walking
together
from
the
park
to
the
*NL*
cottage
--
``
but
pray
,
are
you
personally
acquainted
with
your
*NL*
sister-in-law
's
mother
,
Mrs.
Ferrars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
DID
think
the
question
a
very
odd
one
,
and
her
countenance
*NL*
expressed
it
,
as
she
answered
that
she
had
never
seen
Mrs.
Ferrars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
replied
Lucy
;
``
I
wonder
at
that
,
for
I
thought
you
must
have
*NL*
seen
her
at
Norland
sometimes
.
Then
,
perhaps
,
you
can
not
tell
me
what
*NL*
sort
of
a
woman
she
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
returned
Elinor
,
cautious
of
giving
her
real
opinion
of
Edward
's
*NL*
mother
,
and
not
very
desirous
of
satisfying
what
seemed
impertinent
*NL*
curiosity
--
``
I
know
nothing
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
think
me
very
strange
,
for
enquiring
about
her
in
such
a
*NL*
way
,
''
said
Lucy
,
eyeing
Elinor
attentively
as
she
spoke
;
``
but
perhaps
*NL*
there
may
be
reasons
--
I
wish
I
might
venture
;
but
however
I
hope
you
*NL*
will
do
me
the
justice
of
believing
that
I
do
not
mean
to
be
*NL*
impertinent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
made
her
a
civil
reply
,
and
they
walked
on
for
a
few
minutes
in
*NL*
silence
.
It
was
broken
by
Lucy
,
who
renewed
the
subject
again
by
*NL*
saying
,
with
some
hesitation
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
bear
to
have
you
think
me
impertinently
curious
.
I
am
sure
I
*NL*
would
rather
do
any
thing
in
the
world
than
be
thought
so
by
a
person
*NL*
whose
good
opinion
is
so
well
worth
having
as
yours
.
And
I
am
sure
I
*NL*
should
not
have
the
smallest
fear
of
trusting
YOU
;
indeed
,
I
should
be
*NL*
very
glad
of
your
advice
how
to
manage
in
such
an
uncomfortable
*NL*
situation
as
I
am
;
but
,
however
,
there
is
no
occasion
to
trouble
YOU
.
*NL*
I
am
sorry
you
do
not
happen
to
know
Mrs.
Ferrars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
I
do
NOT
,
''
said
Elinor
,
in
great
astonishment
,
``
if
it
could
*NL*
be
of
any
use
to
YOU
to
know
my
opinion
of
her
.
But
really
I
never
*NL*
understood
that
you
were
at
all
connected
with
that
family
,
and
*NL*
therefore
I
am
a
little
surprised
,
I
confess
,
at
so
serious
an
inquiry
*NL*
into
her
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
you
are
,
and
I
am
sure
I
do
not
at
all
wonder
at
it
.
But
*NL*
if
I
dared
tell
you
all
,
you
would
not
be
so
much
surprised
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Ferrars
is
certainly
nothing
to
me
at
present
--
but
the
time
MAY
*NL*
come
--
how
soon
it
will
come
must
depend
upon
herself
--
when
we
may
be
*NL*
very
intimately
connected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
down
as
she
said
this
,
amiably
bashful
,
with
only
one
side
*NL*
glance
at
her
companion
to
observe
its
effect
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
cried
Elinor
,
``
what
do
you
mean
?
Are
you
acquainted
*NL*
with
Mr.
Robert
Ferrars
?
Can
you
be
?
''
And
she
did
not
feel
much
*NL*
delighted
with
the
idea
of
such
a
sister-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Lucy
,
``
not
to
Mr.
ROBERT
Ferrars
--
I
never
saw
him
in
my
*NL*
life
;
but
,
''
fixing
her
eyes
upon
Elinor
,
``
to
his
eldest
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
felt
Elinor
at
that
moment
?
Astonishment
,
that
would
have
been
as
*NL*
painful
as
it
was
strong
,
had
not
an
immediate
disbelief
of
the
*NL*
assertion
attended
it
.
She
turned
towards
Lucy
in
silent
amazement
,
*NL*
unable
to
divine
the
reason
or
object
of
such
a
declaration
;
and
though
*NL*
her
complexion
varied
,
she
stood
firm
in
incredulity
,
and
felt
in
no
*NL*
danger
of
an
hysterical
fit
,
or
a
swoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
well
be
surprised
,
''
continued
Lucy
;
``
for
to
be
sure
you
could
*NL*
have
had
no
idea
of
it
before
;
for
I
dare
say
he
never
dropped
the
*NL*
smallest
hint
of
it
to
you
or
any
of
your
family
;
because
it
was
always
*NL*
meant
to
be
a
great
secret
,
and
I
am
sure
has
been
faithfully
kept
so
*NL*
by
me
to
this
hour
.
Not
a
soul
of
all
my
relations
know
of
it
but
*NL*
Anne
,
and
I
never
should
have
mentioned
it
to
you
,
if
I
had
not
felt
*NL*
the
greatest
dependence
in
the
world
upon
your
secrecy
;
and
I
really
*NL*
thought
my
behaviour
in
asking
so
many
questions
about
Mrs.
Ferrars
*NL*
must
seem
so
odd
,
that
it
ought
to
be
explained
.
And
I
do
not
think
*NL*
Mr.
Ferrars
can
be
displeased
,
when
he
knows
I
have
trusted
you
,
*NL*
because
I
know
he
has
the
highest
opinion
in
the
world
of
all
your
*NL*
family
,
and
looks
upon
yourself
and
the
other
Miss
Dashwoods
quite
as
*NL*
his
own
sisters
.
''
--
She
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
for
a
few
moments
remained
silent
.
Her
astonishment
at
what
she
*NL*
heard
was
at
first
too
great
for
words
;
but
at
length
forcing
herself
*NL*
to
speak
,
and
to
speak
cautiously
,
she
said
,
with
calmness
of
manner
,
*NL*
which
tolerably
well
concealed
her
surprise
and
solicitude
--
``
May
I
ask
*NL*
if
your
engagement
is
of
long
standing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
engaged
these
four
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
years
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
though
greatly
shocked
,
still
felt
unable
to
believe
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
you
were
even
acquainted
till
the
*NL*
other
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
acquaintance
,
however
,
is
of
many
years
date
.
He
was
under
my
*NL*
uncle
's
care
,
you
know
,
a
considerable
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
uncle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
Mr.
Pratt
.
Did
you
never
hear
him
talk
of
Mr.
Pratt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
have
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
with
an
exertion
of
spirits
,
which
*NL*
increased
with
her
increase
of
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
four
years
with
my
uncle
,
who
lives
at
Longstaple
,
near
*NL*
Plymouth
.
It
was
there
our
acquaintance
begun
,
for
my
sister
and
me
*NL*
was
often
staying
with
my
uncle
,
and
it
was
there
our
engagement
was
*NL*
formed
,
though
not
till
a
year
after
he
had
quitted
as
a
pupil
;
but
he
*NL*
was
almost
always
with
us
afterwards
.
I
was
very
unwilling
to
enter
*NL*
into
it
,
as
you
may
imagine
,
without
the
knowledge
and
approbation
of
*NL*
his
mother
;
but
I
was
too
young
,
and
loved
him
too
well
,
to
be
so
*NL*
prudent
as
I
ought
to
have
been
.
--
Though
you
do
not
know
him
so
well
*NL*
as
me
,
Miss
Dashwood
,
you
must
have
seen
enough
of
him
to
be
sensible
*NL*
he
is
very
capable
of
making
a
woman
sincerely
attached
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
answered
Elinor
,
without
knowing
what
she
said
;
but
after
*NL*
a
moment
's
reflection
,
she
added
,
with
revived
security
of
Edward
's
*NL*
honour
and
love
,
and
her
companion
's
falsehood
--
``
Engaged
to
Mr.
Edward
*NL*
Ferrars
!
--
I
confess
myself
so
totally
surprised
at
what
you
tell
me
,
*NL*
that
really
--
I
beg
your
pardon
;
but
surely
there
must
be
some
mistake
*NL*
of
person
or
name
.
We
can
not
mean
the
same
Mr.
Ferrars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
mean
no
other
,
''
cried
Lucy
,
smiling
.
``
Mr.
Edward
Ferrars
,
the
*NL*
eldest
son
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
of
Park
Street
,
and
brother
of
your
*NL*
sister-in-law
,
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
,
is
the
person
I
mean
;
you
must
allow
*NL*
that
I
am
not
likely
to
be
deceived
as
to
the
name
of
the
man
on
who
*NL*
all
my
happiness
depends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
strange
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
in
a
most
painful
perplexity
,
``
that
I
*NL*
should
never
have
heard
him
even
mention
your
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
considering
our
situation
,
it
was
not
strange
.
Our
first
care
has
*NL*
been
to
keep
the
matter
secret
.
--
You
knew
nothing
of
me
,
or
my
family
,
*NL*
and
,
therefore
,
there
could
be
no
OCCASION
for
ever
mentioning
my
name
*NL*
to
you
;
and
,
as
he
was
always
particularly
afraid
of
his
sister
's
*NL*
suspecting
any
thing
,
THAT
was
reason
enough
for
his
not
mentioning
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
.
--
Elinor
's
security
sunk
;
but
her
self-command
did
not
*NL*
sink
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
years
you
have
been
engaged
,
''
said
she
with
a
firm
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
heaven
knows
how
much
longer
we
may
have
to
wait
.
Poor
*NL*
Edward
!
It
puts
him
quite
out
of
heart
.
''
Then
taking
a
small
miniature
*NL*
from
her
pocket
,
she
added
,
``
To
prevent
the
possibility
of
mistake
,
be
*NL*
so
good
as
to
look
at
this
face
.
It
does
not
do
him
justice
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
but
yet
I
think
you
can
not
be
deceived
as
to
the
person
it
was
*NL*
drew
for
.
--
I
have
had
it
above
these
three
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
it
into
her
hands
as
she
spoke
;
and
when
Elinor
saw
the
*NL*
painting
,
whatever
other
doubts
her
fear
of
a
too
hasty
decision
,
or
*NL*
her
wish
of
detecting
falsehood
might
suffer
to
linger
in
her
mind
,
she
*NL*
could
have
none
of
its
being
Edward
's
face
.
She
returned
it
almost
*NL*
instantly
,
acknowledging
the
likeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
been
able
,
''
continued
Lucy
,
``
to
give
him
my
picture
in
*NL*
return
,
which
I
am
very
much
vexed
at
,
for
he
has
been
always
so
*NL*
anxious
to
get
it
!
But
I
am
determined
to
set
for
it
the
very
first
*NL*
opportunity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
in
the
right
,
''
replied
Elinor
calmly
.
They
then
*NL*
proceeded
a
few
paces
in
silence
.
Lucy
spoke
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
have
no
doubt
in
the
world
of
your
faithfully
*NL*
keeping
this
secret
,
because
you
must
know
of
what
importance
it
is
to
*NL*
us
,
not
to
have
it
reach
his
mother
;
for
she
would
never
approve
of
it
,
*NL*
I
dare
say
.
I
shall
have
no
fortune
,
and
I
fancy
she
is
an
exceeding
*NL*
proud
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
did
not
seek
your
confidence
,
''
said
Elinor
;
``
but
you
do
me
*NL*
no
more
than
justice
in
imagining
that
I
may
be
depended
on
.
Your
*NL*
secret
is
safe
with
me
;
but
pardon
me
if
I
express
some
surprise
at
so
*NL*
unnecessary
a
communication
.
You
must
at
least
have
felt
that
my
being
*NL*
acquainted
with
it
could
not
add
to
its
safety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
said
this
,
she
looked
earnestly
at
Lucy
,
hoping
to
discover
*NL*
something
in
her
countenance
;
perhaps
the
falsehood
of
the
greatest
*NL*
part
of
what
she
had
been
saying
;
but
Lucy
's
countenance
suffered
no
*NL*
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
you
would
think
I
was
taking
a
great
liberty
with
you
,
''
*NL*
said
she
,
``
in
telling
you
all
this
.
I
have
not
known
you
long
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
personally
at
least
,
but
I
have
known
you
and
all
your
family
by
*NL*
description
a
great
while
;
and
as
soon
as
I
saw
you
,
I
felt
almost
as
*NL*
if
you
was
an
old
acquaintance
.
Besides
in
the
present
case
,
I
really
*NL*
thought
some
explanation
was
due
to
you
after
my
making
such
particular
*NL*
inquiries
about
Edward
's
mother
;
and
I
am
so
unfortunate
,
that
I
have
*NL*
not
a
creature
whose
advice
I
can
ask
.
Anne
is
the
only
person
that
*NL*
knows
of
it
,
and
she
has
no
judgment
at
all
;
indeed
,
she
does
me
a
*NL*
great
deal
more
harm
than
good
,
for
I
am
in
constant
fear
of
her
*NL*
betraying
me
.
She
does
not
know
how
to
hold
her
tongue
,
as
you
must
*NL*
perceive
,
and
I
am
sure
I
was
in
the
greatest
fright
in
the
world
*NL*
t
`
other
day
,
when
Edward
's
name
was
mentioned
by
Sir
John
,
lest
she
*NL*
should
out
with
it
all
.
You
ca
n't
think
how
much
I
go
through
in
my
*NL*
mind
from
it
altogether
.
I
only
wonder
that
I
am
alive
after
what
I
*NL*
have
suffered
for
Edward
's
sake
these
last
four
years
.
Every
thing
in
*NL*
such
suspense
and
uncertainty
;
and
seeing
him
so
seldom
--
we
can
hardly
*NL*
meet
above
twice
a-year
.
I
am
sure
I
wonder
my
heart
is
not
quite
*NL*
broke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
;
but
Elinor
did
not
feel
very
*NL*
compassionate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
.
''
continued
Lucy
,
after
wiping
her
eyes
,
``
I
think
whether
it
*NL*
would
not
be
better
for
us
both
to
break
off
the
matter
entirely
.
''
As
*NL*
she
said
this
,
she
looked
directly
at
her
companion
.
``
But
then
at
*NL*
other
times
I
have
not
resolution
enough
for
it
.
--
I
can
not
bear
the
*NL*
thoughts
of
making
him
so
miserable
,
as
I
know
the
very
mention
of
such
*NL*
a
thing
would
do
.
And
on
my
own
account
too
--
so
dear
as
he
is
to
me
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
I
could
be
equal
to
it
.
What
would
you
advise
me
to
do
in
*NL*
such
a
case
,
Miss
Dashwood
?
What
would
you
do
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
startled
by
the
question
;
``
but
I
can
give
*NL*
you
no
advice
under
such
circumstances
.
Your
own
judgment
must
direct
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
continued
Lucy
,
after
a
few
minutes
silence
on
both
*NL*
sides
,
``
his
mother
must
provide
for
him
sometime
or
other
;
but
poor
*NL*
Edward
is
so
cast
down
by
it
!
Did
you
not
think
him
dreadful
*NL*
low-spirited
when
he
was
at
Barton
?
He
was
so
miserable
when
he
left
*NL*
us
at
Longstaple
,
to
go
to
you
,
that
I
was
afraid
you
would
think
him
*NL*
quite
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
come
from
your
uncle
's
,
then
,
when
he
visited
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
he
had
been
staying
a
fortnight
with
us
.
Did
you
think
he
*NL*
came
directly
from
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
most
feelingly
sensible
of
every
fresh
*NL*
circumstance
in
favour
of
Lucy
's
veracity
;
``
I
remember
he
told
us
,
that
*NL*
he
had
been
staying
a
fortnight
with
some
friends
near
Plymouth
.
''
She
*NL*
remembered
too
,
her
own
surprise
at
the
time
,
at
his
mentioning
nothing
*NL*
farther
of
those
friends
,
at
his
total
silence
with
respect
even
to
*NL*
their
names
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
not
you
think
him
sadly
out
of
spirits
?
''
repeated
Lucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did
,
indeed
,
particularly
so
when
he
first
arrived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
begged
him
to
exert
himself
for
fear
you
should
suspect
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
;
but
it
made
him
so
melancholy
,
not
being
able
to
stay
more
than
*NL*
a
fortnight
with
us
,
and
seeing
me
so
much
affected
.
--
Poor
fellow
!
--
I
*NL*
am
afraid
it
is
just
the
same
with
him
now
;
for
he
writes
in
wretched
*NL*
spirits
.
I
heard
from
him
just
before
I
left
Exeter
;
''
taking
a
letter
*NL*
from
her
pocket
and
carelessly
showing
the
direction
to
Elinor
.
``
You
*NL*
know
his
hand
,
I
dare
say
,
a
charming
one
it
is
;
but
that
is
not
*NL*
written
so
well
as
usual
.
--
He
was
tired
,
I
dare
say
,
for
he
had
just
*NL*
filled
the
sheet
to
me
as
full
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
saw
that
it
WAS
his
hand
,
and
she
could
doubt
no
longer
.
This
*NL*
picture
,
she
had
allowed
herself
to
believe
,
might
have
been
*NL*
accidentally
obtained
;
it
might
not
have
been
Edward
's
gift
;
but
a
*NL*
correspondence
between
them
by
letter
,
could
subsist
only
under
a
*NL*
positive
engagement
,
could
be
authorised
by
nothing
else
;
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
she
was
almost
overcome
--
her
heart
sunk
within
her
,
and
she
*NL*
could
hardly
stand
;
but
exertion
was
indispensably
necessary
;
and
she
*NL*
struggled
so
resolutely
against
the
oppression
of
her
feelings
,
that
*NL*
her
success
was
speedy
,
and
for
the
time
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Writing
to
each
other
,
''
said
Lucy
,
returning
the
letter
into
her
*NL*
pocket
,
``
is
the
only
comfort
we
have
in
such
long
separations

Yes
,
I
*NL*
have
one
other
comfort
in
his
picture
,
but
poor
Edward
has
not
even
*NL*
THAT
.
If
he
had
but
my
picture
,
he
says
he
should
be
easy
.
I
gave
him
*NL*
a
lock
of
my
hair
set
in
a
ring
when
he
was
at
Longstaple
last
,
and
*NL*
that
was
some
comfort
to
him
,
he
said
,
but
not
equal
to
a
picture
.
*NL*
Perhaps
you
might
notice
the
ring
when
you
saw
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
,
''
said
Elinor
,
with
a
composure
of
voice
,
under
which
was
*NL*
concealed
an
emotion
and
distress
beyond
any
thing
she
had
ever
felt
*NL*
before
.
She
was
mortified
,
shocked
,
confounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
for
her
,
they
had
now
reached
the
cottage
,
and
the
*NL*
conversation
could
be
continued
no
farther
.
After
sitting
with
them
a
*NL*
few
minutes
,
the
Miss
Steeles
returned
to
the
Park
,
and
Elinor
was
then
*NL*
at
liberty
to
think
and
be
wretched

CHAPTER
23
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
However
small
Elinor
's
general
dependence
on
Lucy
's
veracity
might
be
,
*NL*
it
was
impossible
for
her
on
serious
reflection
to
suspect
it
in
the
*NL*
present
case
,
where
no
temptation
could
be
answerable
to
the
folly
of
*NL*
inventing
a
falsehood
of
such
a
description
.
What
Lucy
had
asserted
to
*NL*
be
true
,
therefore
,
Elinor
could
not
,
dared
not
longer
doubt
;
supported
*NL*
as
it
was
too
on
every
side
by
such
probabilities
and
proofs
,
and
*NL*
contradicted
by
nothing
but
her
own
wishes
.
Their
opportunity
of
*NL*
acquaintance
in
the
house
of
Mr.
Pratt
was
a
foundation
for
the
rest
,
*NL*
at
once
indisputable
and
alarming
;
and
Edward
's
visit
near
Plymouth
,
*NL*
his
melancholy
state
of
mind
,
his
dissatisfaction
at
his
own
prospects
,
*NL*
his
uncertain
behaviour
towards
herself
,
the
intimate
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
Miss
Steeles
as
to
Norland
and
their
family
connections
,
which
had
*NL*
often
surprised
her
,
the
picture
,
the
letter
,
the
ring
,
formed
*NL*
altogether
such
a
body
of
evidence
,
as
overcame
every
fear
of
*NL*
condemning
him
unfairly
,
and
established
as
a
fact
,
which
no
partiality
*NL*
could
set
aside
,
his
ill-treatment
of
herself
.
--
Her
resentment
of
such
*NL*
behaviour
,
her
indignation
at
having
been
its
dupe
,
for
a
short
time
*NL*
made
her
feel
only
for
herself
;
but
other
ideas
,
other
considerations
,
*NL*
soon
arose
.
Had
Edward
been
intentionally
deceiving
her
?
Had
he
*NL*
feigned
a
regard
for
her
which
he
did
not
feel
?
Was
his
engagement
to
*NL*
Lucy
an
engagement
of
the
heart
?
No
;
whatever
it
might
once
have
been
,
*NL*
she
could
not
believe
it
such
at
present
.
His
affection
was
all
her
*NL*
own
.
She
could
not
be
deceived
in
that
.
Her
mother
,
sisters
,
Fanny
,
*NL*
all
had
been
conscious
of
his
regard
for
her
at
Norland
;
it
was
not
an
*NL*
illusion
of
her
own
vanity
.
He
certainly
loved
her
.
What
a
softener
*NL*
of
the
heart
was
this
persuasion
!
How
much
could
it
not
tempt
her
to
*NL*
forgive
!
He
had
been
blamable
,
highly
blamable
,
in
remaining
at
*NL*
Norland
after
he
first
felt
her
influence
over
him
to
be
more
than
it
*NL*
ought
to
be
.
In
that
,
he
could
not
be
defended
;
but
if
he
had
injured
*NL*
her
,
how
much
more
had
he
injured
himself
;
if
her
case
were
pitiable
,
*NL*
his
was
hopeless
.
His
imprudence
had
made
her
miserable
for
a
while
;
*NL*
but
it
seemed
to
have
deprived
himself
of
all
chance
of
ever
being
*NL*
otherwise
.
She
might
in
time
regain
tranquillity
;
but
HE
,
what
had
he
*NL*
to
look
forward
to
?
Could
he
ever
be
tolerably
happy
with
Lucy
Steele
;
*NL*
could
he
,
were
his
affection
for
herself
out
of
the
question
,
with
his
*NL*
integrity
,
his
delicacy
,
and
well-informed
mind
,
be
satisfied
with
a
*NL*
wife
like
her
--
illiterate
,
artful
,
and
selfish
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
youthful
infatuation
of
nineteen
would
naturally
blind
him
to
every
*NL*
thing
but
her
beauty
and
good
nature
;
but
the
four
succeeding
*NL*
years
--
years
,
which
if
rationally
spent
,
give
such
improvement
to
the
*NL*
understanding
,
must
have
opened
his
eyes
to
her
defects
of
education
,
*NL*
while
the
same
period
of
time
,
spent
on
her
side
in
inferior
society
*NL*
and
more
frivolous
pursuits
,
had
perhaps
robbed
her
of
that
simplicity
*NL*
which
might
once
have
given
an
interesting
character
to
her
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
in
the
supposition
of
his
seeking
to
marry
herself
,
his
difficulties
*NL*
from
his
mother
had
seemed
great
,
how
much
greater
were
they
now
likely
*NL*
to
be
,
when
the
object
of
his
engagement
was
undoubtedly
inferior
in
*NL*
connections
,
and
probably
inferior
in
fortune
to
herself
.
These
*NL*
difficulties
,
indeed
,
with
a
heart
so
alienated
from
Lucy
,
might
not
*NL*
press
very
hard
upon
his
patience
;
but
melancholy
was
the
state
of
the
*NL*
person
by
whom
the
expectation
of
family
opposition
and
unkindness
,
*NL*
could
be
felt
as
a
relief
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
these
considerations
occurred
to
her
in
painful
succession
,
she
wept
*NL*
for
him
,
more
than
for
herself
.
Supported
by
the
conviction
of
having
*NL*
done
nothing
to
merit
her
present
unhappiness
,
and
consoled
by
the
*NL*
belief
that
Edward
had
done
nothing
to
forfeit
her
esteem
,
she
thought
*NL*
she
could
even
now
,
under
the
first
smart
of
the
heavy
blow
,
command
*NL*
herself
enough
to
guard
every
suspicion
of
the
truth
from
her
mother
*NL*
and
sisters
.
And
so
well
was
she
able
to
answer
her
own
expectations
,
*NL*
that
when
she
joined
them
at
dinner
only
two
hours
after
she
had
first
*NL*
suffered
the
extinction
of
all
her
dearest
hopes
,
no
one
would
have
*NL*
supposed
from
the
appearance
of
the
sisters
,
that
Elinor
was
mourning
*NL*
in
secret
over
obstacles
which
must
divide
her
for
ever
from
the
object
*NL*
of
her
love
,
and
that
Marianne
was
internally
dwelling
on
the
*NL*
perfections
of
a
man
,
of
whose
whole
heart
she
felt
thoroughly
*NL*
possessed
,
and
whom
she
expected
to
see
in
every
carriage
which
drove
*NL*
near
their
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
necessity
of
concealing
from
her
mother
and
Marianne
,
what
had
been
*NL*
entrusted
in
confidence
to
herself
,
though
it
obliged
her
to
unceasing
*NL*
exertion
,
was
no
aggravation
of
Elinor
's
distress
.
On
the
contrary
it
*NL*
was
a
relief
to
her
,
to
be
spared
the
communication
of
what
would
give
*NL*
such
affliction
to
them
,
and
to
be
saved
likewise
from
hearing
that
*NL*
condemnation
of
Edward
,
which
would
probably
flow
from
the
excess
of
*NL*
their
partial
affection
for
herself
,
and
which
was
more
than
she
felt
*NL*
equal
to
support
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
their
counsel
,
or
their
conversation
,
she
knew
she
could
receive
*NL*
no
assistance
,
their
tenderness
and
sorrow
must
add
to
her
distress
,
*NL*
while
her
self-command
would
neither
receive
encouragement
from
their
*NL*
example
nor
from
their
praise
.
She
was
stronger
alone
,
and
her
own
*NL*
good
sense
so
well
supported
her
,
that
her
firmness
was
as
unshaken
,
*NL*
her
appearance
of
cheerfulness
as
invariable
,
as
with
regrets
so
*NL*
poignant
and
so
fresh
,
it
was
possible
for
them
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
as
she
had
suffered
from
her
first
conversation
with
Lucy
on
the
*NL*
subject
,
she
soon
felt
an
earnest
wish
of
renewing
it
;
and
this
for
*NL*
more
reasons
than
one
.
She
wanted
to
hear
many
particulars
of
their
*NL*
engagement
repeated
again
,
she
wanted
more
clearly
to
understand
what
*NL*
Lucy
really
felt
for
Edward
,
whether
there
were
any
sincerity
in
her
*NL*
declaration
of
tender
regard
for
him
,
and
she
particularly
wanted
to
*NL*
convince
Lucy
,
by
her
readiness
to
enter
on
the
matter
again
,
and
her
*NL*
calmness
in
conversing
on
it
,
that
she
was
no
otherwise
interested
in
*NL*
it
than
as
a
friend
,
which
she
very
much
feared
her
involuntary
*NL*
agitation
,
in
their
morning
discourse
,
must
have
left
at
least
*NL*
doubtful
.
That
Lucy
was
disposed
to
be
jealous
of
her
appeared
very
*NL*
probable
:
it
was
plain
that
Edward
had
always
spoken
highly
in
her
*NL*
praise
,
not
merely
from
Lucy
's
assertion
,
but
from
her
venturing
to
*NL*
trust
her
on
so
short
a
personal
acquaintance
,
with
a
secret
so
*NL*
confessedly
and
evidently
important
.
And
even
Sir
John
's
joking
*NL*
intelligence
must
have
had
some
weight
.
But
indeed
,
while
Elinor
*NL*
remained
so
well
assured
within
herself
of
being
really
beloved
by
*NL*
Edward
,
it
required
no
other
consideration
of
probabilities
to
make
it
*NL*
natural
that
Lucy
should
be
jealous
;
and
that
she
was
so
,
her
very
*NL*
confidence
was
a
proof
.
What
other
reason
for
the
disclosure
of
the
*NL*
affair
could
there
be
,
but
that
Elinor
might
be
informed
by
it
of
*NL*
Lucy
's
superior
claims
on
Edward
,
and
be
taught
to
avoid
him
in
future
?
*NL*
She
had
little
difficulty
in
understanding
thus
much
of
her
rival
's
*NL*
intentions
,
and
while
she
was
firmly
resolved
to
act
by
her
as
every
*NL*
principle
of
honour
and
honesty
directed
,
to
combat
her
own
affection
*NL*
for
Edward
and
to
see
him
as
little
as
possible
;
she
could
not
deny
*NL*
herself
the
comfort
of
endeavouring
to
convince
Lucy
that
her
heart
was
*NL*
unwounded
.
And
as
she
could
now
have
nothing
more
painful
to
hear
on
*NL*
the
subject
than
had
already
been
told
,
she
did
not
mistrust
her
own
*NL*
ability
of
going
through
a
repetition
of
particulars
with
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
immediately
that
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
could
be
*NL*
commanded
,
though
Lucy
was
as
well
disposed
as
herself
to
take
*NL*
advantage
of
any
that
occurred
;
for
the
weather
was
not
often
fine
*NL*
enough
to
allow
of
their
joining
in
a
walk
,
where
they
might
most
*NL*
easily
separate
themselves
from
the
others
;
and
though
they
met
at
*NL*
least
every
other
evening
either
at
the
park
or
cottage
,
and
chiefly
at
*NL*
the
former
,
they
could
not
be
supposed
to
meet
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
conversation
.
Such
a
thought
would
never
enter
either
Sir
John
or
Lady
*NL*
Middleton
's
head
;
and
therefore
very
little
leisure
was
ever
given
for
*NL*
a
general
chat
,
and
none
at
all
for
particular
discourse
.
They
met
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
eating
,
drinking
,
and
laughing
together
,
playing
at
cards
,
*NL*
or
consequences
,
or
any
other
game
that
was
sufficiently
noisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
or
two
meetings
of
this
kind
had
taken
place
,
without
affording
*NL*
Elinor
any
chance
of
engaging
Lucy
in
private
,
when
Sir
John
called
at
*NL*
the
cottage
one
morning
,
to
beg
,
in
the
name
of
charity
,
that
they
*NL*
would
all
dine
with
Lady
Middleton
that
day
,
as
he
was
obliged
to
*NL*
attend
the
club
at
Exeter
,
and
she
would
otherwise
be
quite
alone
,
*NL*
except
her
mother
and
the
two
Miss
Steeles
.
Elinor
,
who
foresaw
a
*NL*
fairer
opening
for
the
point
she
had
in
view
,
in
such
a
party
as
this
*NL*
was
likely
to
be
,
more
at
liberty
among
themselves
under
the
tranquil
*NL*
and
well-bred
direction
of
Lady
Middleton
than
when
her
husband
united
*NL*
them
together
in
one
noisy
purpose
,
immediately
accepted
the
*NL*
invitation
;
Margaret
,
with
her
mother
's
permission
,
was
equally
*NL*
compliant
,
and
Marianne
,
though
always
unwilling
to
join
any
of
their
*NL*
parties
,
was
persuaded
by
her
mother
,
who
could
not
bear
to
have
her
*NL*
seclude
herself
from
any
chance
of
amusement
,
to
go
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
ladies
went
,
and
Lady
Middleton
was
happily
preserved
from
*NL*
the
frightful
solitude
which
had
threatened
her
.
The
insipidity
of
the
*NL*
meeting
was
exactly
such
as
Elinor
had
expected
;
it
produced
not
one
*NL*
novelty
of
thought
or
expression
,
and
nothing
could
be
less
interesting
*NL*
than
the
whole
of
their
discourse
both
in
the
dining
parlour
and
*NL*
drawing
room
:
to
the
latter
,
the
children
accompanied
them
,
and
while
*NL*
they
remained
there
,
she
was
too
well
convinced
of
the
impossibility
of
*NL*
engaging
Lucy
's
attention
to
attempt
it
.
They
quitted
it
only
with
the
*NL*
removal
of
the
tea-things
.
The
card-table
was
then
placed
,
and
Elinor
*NL*
began
to
wonder
at
herself
for
having
ever
entertained
a
hope
of
*NL*
finding
time
for
conversation
at
the
park
.
They
all
rose
up
in
*NL*
preparation
for
a
round
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
,
''
said
Lady
Middleton
to
Lucy
,
``
you
are
not
going
to
finish
*NL*
poor
little
Annamaria
's
basket
this
evening
;
for
I
am
sure
it
must
hurt
*NL*
your
eyes
to
work
filigree
by
candlelight
.
And
we
will
make
the
dear
*NL*
little
love
some
amends
for
her
disappointment
to-morrow
,
and
then
I
*NL*
hope
she
will
not
much
mind
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
hint
was
enough
,
Lucy
recollected
herself
instantly
and
replied
,
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
are
very
much
mistaken
,
Lady
Middleton
;
I
am
only
waiting
*NL*
to
know
whether
you
can
make
your
party
without
me
,
or
I
should
have
*NL*
been
at
my
filigree
already
.
I
would
not
disappoint
the
little
angel
*NL*
for
all
the
world
:
and
if
you
want
me
at
the
card-table
now
,
I
am
*NL*
resolved
to
finish
the
basket
after
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
good
,
I
hope
it
wo
n't
hurt
your
eyes
--
will
you
ring
the
*NL*
bell
for
some
working
candles
?
My
poor
little
girl
would
be
sadly
*NL*
disappointed
,
I
know
,
if
the
basket
was
not
finished
tomorrow
,
for
*NL*
though
I
told
her
it
certainly
would
not
,
I
am
sure
she
depends
upon
*NL*
having
it
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
directly
drew
her
work
table
near
her
and
reseated
herself
with
an
*NL*
alacrity
and
cheerfulness
which
seemed
to
infer
that
she
could
taste
no
*NL*
greater
delight
than
in
making
a
filigree
basket
for
a
spoilt
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Middleton
proposed
a
rubber
of
Casino
to
the
others
.
No
one
made
*NL*
any
objection
but
Marianne
,
who
with
her
usual
inattention
to
the
forms
*NL*
of
general
civility
,
exclaimed
,
``
Your
Ladyship
will
have
the
goodness
*NL*
to
excuse
ME
--
you
know
I
detest
cards
.
I
shall
go
to
the
piano-forte
;
*NL*
I
have
not
touched
it
since
it
was
tuned
.
''
And
without
farther
*NL*
ceremony
,
she
turned
away
and
walked
to
the
instrument
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Middleton
looked
as
if
she
thanked
heaven
that
SHE
had
never
made
*NL*
so
rude
a
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marianne
can
never
keep
long
from
that
instrument
you
know
,
ma'am
,
''
*NL*
said
Elinor
,
endeavouring
to
smooth
away
the
offence
;
``
and
I
do
not
*NL*
much
wonder
at
it
;
for
it
is
the
very
best
toned
piano-forte
I
ever
*NL*
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
remaining
five
were
now
to
draw
their
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
continued
Elinor
,
``
if
I
should
happen
to
cut
out
,
I
may
be
*NL*
of
some
use
to
Miss
Lucy
Steele
,
in
rolling
her
papers
for
her
;
and
*NL*
there
is
so
much
still
to
be
done
to
the
basket
,
that
it
must
be
*NL*
impossible
I
think
for
her
labour
singly
,
to
finish
it
this
evening
.
I
*NL*
should
like
the
work
exceedingly
,
if
she
would
allow
me
a
share
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
help
,
''
cried
Lucy
,
*NL*
``
for
I
find
there
is
more
to
be
done
to
it
than
I
thought
there
was
;
*NL*
and
it
would
be
a
shocking
thing
to
disappoint
dear
Annamaria
after
*NL*
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
that
would
be
terrible
,
indeed
,
''
said
Miss
Steele
--
``
Dear
little
*NL*
soul
,
how
I
do
love
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
kind
,
''
said
Lady
Middleton
to
Elinor
;
``
and
as
you
really
*NL*
like
the
work
,
perhaps
you
will
be
as
well
pleased
not
to
cut
in
till
*NL*
another
rubber
,
or
will
you
take
your
chance
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
joyfully
profited
by
the
first
of
these
proposals
,
and
thus
by
a
*NL*
little
of
that
address
which
Marianne
could
never
condescend
to
*NL*
practise
,
gained
her
own
end
,
and
pleased
Lady
Middleton
at
the
same
*NL*
time
.
Lucy
made
room
for
her
with
ready
attention
,
and
the
two
fair
*NL*
rivals
were
thus
seated
side
by
side
at
the
same
table
,
and
,
with
the
*NL*
utmost
harmony
,
engaged
in
forwarding
the
same
work
.
The
pianoforte
at
*NL*
which
Marianne
,
wrapped
up
in
her
own
music
and
her
own
thoughts
,
had
*NL*
by
this
time
forgotten
that
any
body
was
in
the
room
besides
herself
,
*NL*
was
luckily
so
near
them
that
Miss
Dashwood
now
judged
she
might
*NL*
safely
,
under
the
shelter
of
its
noise
,
introduce
the
interesting
*NL*
subject
,
without
any
risk
of
being
heard
at
the
card-table
.

CHAPTER
24
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
firm
,
though
cautious
tone
,
Elinor
thus
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
undeserving
of
the
confidence
you
have
honoured
me
with
,
*NL*
if
I
felt
no
desire
for
its
continuance
,
or
no
farther
curiosity
on
its
*NL*
subject
.
I
will
not
apologize
therefore
for
bringing
it
forward
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
cried
Lucy
warmly
,
``
for
breaking
the
ice
;
you
have
set
my
*NL*
heart
at
ease
by
it
;
for
I
was
somehow
or
other
afraid
I
had
offended
*NL*
you
by
what
I
told
you
that
Monday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Offended
me
!
How
could
you
suppose
so
?
Believe
me
,
''
and
Elinor
spoke
*NL*
it
with
the
truest
sincerity
,
``
nothing
could
be
farther
from
my
*NL*
intention
than
to
give
you
such
an
idea
.
Could
you
have
a
motive
for
*NL*
the
trust
,
that
was
not
honourable
and
flattering
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
do
assure
you
,
''
replied
Lucy
,
her
little
sharp
eyes
full
of
*NL*
meaning
,
``
there
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
coldness
and
displeasure
in
your
*NL*
manner
that
made
me
quite
uncomfortable
.
I
felt
sure
that
you
was
*NL*
angry
with
me
;
and
have
been
quarrelling
with
myself
ever
since
,
for
*NL*
having
took
such
a
liberty
as
to
trouble
you
with
my
affairs
.
But
I
am
*NL*
very
glad
to
find
it
was
only
my
own
fancy
,
and
that
you
really
do
not
*NL*
blame
me
.
If
you
knew
what
a
consolation
it
was
to
me
to
relieve
my
*NL*
heart
speaking
to
you
of
what
I
am
always
thinking
of
every
moment
of
*NL*
my
life
,
your
compassion
would
make
you
overlook
every
thing
else
I
am
*NL*
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
can
easily
believe
that
it
was
a
very
great
relief
to
you
,
*NL*
to
acknowledge
your
situation
to
me
,
and
be
assured
that
you
shall
*NL*
never
have
reason
to
repent
it
.
Your
case
is
a
very
unfortunate
one
;
*NL*
you
seem
to
me
to
be
surrounded
with
difficulties
,
and
you
will
have
*NL*
need
of
all
your
mutual
affection
to
support
you
under
them
.
Mr.
*NL*
Ferrars
,
I
believe
,
is
entirely
dependent
on
his
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
only
two
thousand
pounds
of
his
own
;
it
would
be
madness
to
*NL*
marry
upon
that
,
though
for
my
own
part
,
I
could
give
up
every
prospect
*NL*
of
more
without
a
sigh
.
I
have
been
always
used
to
a
very
small
*NL*
income
,
and
could
struggle
with
any
poverty
for
him
;
but
I
love
him
too
*NL*
well
to
be
the
selfish
means
of
robbing
him
,
perhaps
,
of
all
that
his
*NL*
mother
might
give
him
if
he
married
to
please
her
.
We
must
wait
,
it
*NL*
may
be
for
many
years
.
With
almost
every
other
man
in
the
world
,
it
*NL*
would
be
an
alarming
prospect
;
but
Edward
's
affection
and
constancy
*NL*
nothing
can
deprive
me
of
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
conviction
must
be
every
thing
to
you
;
and
he
is
undoubtedly
*NL*
supported
by
the
same
trust
in
your
's
.
If
the
strength
of
your
*NL*
reciprocal
attachment
had
failed
,
as
between
many
people
,
and
under
*NL*
many
circumstances
it
naturally
would
during
a
four
years
'
engagement
,
*NL*
your
situation
would
have
been
pitiable
,
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
here
looked
up
;
but
Elinor
was
careful
in
guarding
her
countenance
*NL*
from
every
expression
that
could
give
her
words
a
suspicious
tendency
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edward
's
love
for
me
,
''
said
Lucy
,
``
has
been
pretty
well
put
to
the
*NL*
test
,
by
our
long
,
very
long
absence
since
we
were
first
engaged
,
and
*NL*
it
has
stood
the
trial
so
well
,
that
I
should
be
unpardonable
to
doubt
*NL*
it
now
.
I
can
safely
say
that
he
has
never
gave
me
one
moment
's
alarm
*NL*
on
that
account
from
the
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
hardly
knew
whether
to
smile
or
sigh
at
this
assertion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
went
on
.
``
I
am
rather
of
a
jealous
temper
too
by
nature
,
and
from
*NL*
our
different
situations
in
life
,
from
his
being
so
much
more
in
the
*NL*
world
than
me
,
and
our
continual
separation
,
I
was
enough
inclined
for
*NL*
suspicion
,
to
have
found
out
the
truth
in
an
instant
,
if
there
had
been
*NL*
the
slightest
alteration
in
his
behaviour
to
me
when
we
met
,
or
any
*NL*
lowness
of
spirits
that
I
could
not
account
for
,
or
if
he
had
talked
*NL*
more
of
one
lady
than
another
,
or
seemed
in
any
respect
less
happy
at
*NL*
Longstaple
than
he
used
to
be
.
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
I
am
*NL*
particularly
observant
or
quick-sighted
in
general
,
but
in
such
a
case
*NL*
I
am
sure
I
could
not
be
deceived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
,
''
thought
Elinor
,
``
is
very
pretty
;
but
it
can
impose
upon
*NL*
neither
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
,
''
said
she
after
a
short
silence
,
``
are
your
views
?
or
have
*NL*
you
none
but
that
of
waiting
for
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
death
,
which
is
a
*NL*
melancholy
and
shocking
extremity
?
--
Is
her
son
determined
to
submit
to
*NL*
this
,
and
to
all
the
tediousness
of
the
many
years
of
suspense
in
which
*NL*
it
may
involve
you
,
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
her
displeasure
for
a
*NL*
while
by
owning
the
truth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
could
be
certain
that
it
would
be
only
for
a
while
!
But
Mrs.
*NL*
Ferrars
is
a
very
headstrong
proud
woman
,
and
in
her
first
fit
of
anger
*NL*
upon
hearing
it
,
would
very
likely
secure
every
thing
to
Robert
,
and
*NL*
the
idea
of
that
,
for
Edward
's
sake
,
frightens
away
all
my
inclination
*NL*
for
hasty
measures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
for
your
own
sake
too
,
or
you
are
carrying
your
disinterestedness
*NL*
beyond
reason

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
looked
at
Elinor
again
,
and
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
Mr.
Robert
Ferrars
?
''
asked
Elinor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
--
I
never
saw
him
;
but
I
fancy
he
is
very
unlike
his
*NL*
brother
--
silly
and
a
great
coxcomb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
coxcomb
!
''
repeated
Miss
Steele
,
whose
ear
had
caught
those
*NL*
words
by
a
sudden
pause
in
Marianne
's
music
.
--
``
Oh
,
they
are
talking
of
*NL*
their
favourite
beaux
,
I
dare
say
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
sister
,
''
cried
Lucy
,
``
you
are
mistaken
there
,
our
favourite
beaux
*NL*
are
NOT
great
coxcombs

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
answer
for
it
that
Miss
Dashwood

is
not

said
Mrs.
Jennings
,
*NL*
laughing
heartily
;
``
for
he
is
one
of
the
modestest
,
prettiest
behaved
*NL*
young
men
I
ever
saw
;

as
for
Lucy
,
she
is
such
a
sly
little
*NL*
creature
,
there
is
no
finding
out
who
SHE
likes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
cried
Miss
Steele
,
looking
significantly
round
at
them
,
``
I
dare
*NL*
say
Lucy
's
beau
is
quite
as
modest
and
pretty
behaved
as
Miss
*NL*
Dashwood
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
blushed
in
spite
of
herself
.
Lucy
bit
her
lip
,
and
looked
*NL*
angrily
at
her
sister
.
A
mutual
silence
took
place
for
some
time
.
*NL*
Lucy
first
put
an
end
to
it
by
saying
in
a
lower
tone
,
though
Marianne
*NL*
was
then
giving
them
the
powerful
protection
of
a
very
magnificent
*NL*
concerto
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
honestly
tell
you
of
one
scheme
which
has
lately
come
into
my
*NL*
head
,
for
bringing
matters
to
bear
;
indeed
I
am
bound
to
let
you
into
*NL*
the
secret
,
for
you
are
a
party
concerned
.
I
dare
say
you
have
seen
*NL*
enough
of
Edward
to
know
that
he
would
prefer
the
church
to
every
other
*NL*
profession
;
now
my
plan
is
that
he
should
take
orders
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
can
,
and
then
through
your
interest
,
which
I
am
sure
you
would
be
kind
*NL*
enough
to
use
out
of
friendship
for
him
,
and
I
hope
out
of
some
regard
*NL*
to
me
,
your
brother
might
be
persuaded
to
give
him
Norland
living
;
*NL*
which
I
understand
is
a
very
good
one
,
and
the
present
incumbent
not
*NL*
likely
to
live
a
great
while
.
That
would
be
enough
for
us
to
marry
*NL*
upon
,
and
we
might
trust
to
time
and
chance
for
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
always
be
happy
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
to
show
any
mark
of
my
*NL*
esteem
and
friendship
for
Mr.
Ferrars
;
but
do
you
not
perceive
that
my
*NL*
interest
on
such
an
occasion
would
be
perfectly
unnecessary
?
He
is
*NL*
brother
to
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
--
THAT
must
be
recommendation
enough
to
*NL*
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
would
not
much
approve
of
Edward
's
going
into
*NL*
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
rather
suspect
that
my
interest
would
do
very
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
again
silent
for
many
minutes
.
At
length
Lucy
exclaimed
with
*NL*
a
deep
sigh
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
would
be
the
wisest
way
to
put
an
end
to
the
business
at
*NL*
once
by
dissolving
the
engagement
.
We
seem
so
beset
with
difficulties
*NL*
on
every
side
,
that
though
it
would
make
us
miserable
for
a
time
,
we
*NL*
should
be
happier
perhaps
in
the
end
.
But
you
will
not
give
me
your
*NL*
advice
,
Miss
Dashwood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Elinor
,
with
a
smile
,
which
concealed
very
agitated
*NL*
feelings
,
``
on
such
a
subject
I
certainly
will
not
.
You
know
very
well
*NL*
that
my
opinion
would
have
no
weight
with
you
,
unless
it
were
on
the
*NL*
side
of
your
wishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
wrong
me

replied
Lucy
,
with
great
solemnity
;
``
I
know
*NL*
nobody
of
whose
judgment
I
think
so
highly
as
I
do
of
yours
;

I
do
*NL*
really
believe
,
that
if
you
was
to
say
to
me

I
advise
you
by
all
*NL*
means
to
put
an
end
to
your
engagement

Edward
Ferrars

it
will
be
*NL*
more
for
the
happiness
of
both
of
you

I
should
resolve
upon
doing
it
*NL*
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
blushed
for
the
insincerity
of
Edward
's
future
wife
,
and
*NL*
replied
,
``
This
compliment
would
effectually
frighten
me
from
giving
any
*NL*
opinion
on
the
subject

I
formed
one

It
raises
my
influence
much
*NL*
too
high
;
the
power
of
dividing
two
people
so
tenderly
attached
is
too
*NL*
much
for
an
indifferent
person

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
because
you
are
an
indifferent
person
,
''
said
Lucy
,
with
some
*NL*
pique
,
and
laying
a
particular
stress
on
those
words
,
``
that
your
*NL*
judgment
might
justly
have
such
weight
with
me
.
If
you
could
be
*NL*
supposed
to
be
biased
in
any
respect
by
your
own
feelings
,
your
opinion
*NL*
would
not
be
worth
having
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
thought
it
wisest
to
make
no
answer
to
this
,
lest
they
might
*NL*
provoke
each
other
to
an
unsuitable
increase
of
ease
and
unreserve
;
and
*NL*
was
even
partly
determined
never
to
mention
the
subject
again

Another
*NL*
pause
therefore
of
many
minutes
'
duration
,
succeeded
this
speech
,
and
*NL*
Lucy
was
still
the
first
to
end
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
be
in
town
this
winter

with
all
*NL*
her
accustomary
complacency

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
that

returned
the
other
,
while
her
eyes
brightened
at
*NL*
the
information
,
``

gave
me
such

*NL*
``

will
be
there
in
February
,
otherwise
*NL*
London
would
have
no
charms
for
me
;
I
have
not
spirits
for
it
.

*NL*
Elinor
was
soon
called
to
the
card-table
by
the
conclusion
of
the
first
*NL*
rubber
,
and
the
confidential
discourse
of
the
two
ladies
was
therefore
*NL*
at
an
end
,
to
which
both
of
them
submitted
without
any
reluctance
,
for
*NL*
nothing
had
been
said
on
either
side
to
make
them
dislike
each
other
*NL*
less
than
they
had
done
before
;
and
Elinor
sat
down
to
the
card
table
*NL*
with
the
melancholy
persuasion
that
Edward
was
not
only
without
*NL*
affection
for
the
person
who
was
to
be
his
wife
;
but
that
he
had
not
*NL*
even
the
chance
of
being
tolerably
happy
in
marriage
,
which
sincere
*NL*
affection
on
HER
side
would
have
given
,
for
self-interest
alone
could
*NL*
induce
a
woman
to
keep
a
man
to
an
engagement
,
of
which
she
seemed
so
*NL*
thoroughly
aware
that
he
was
weary
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
time
the
subject
was
never
revived
by
Elinor
,
and
when
*NL*
entered
on
by
Lucy
,
who
seldom
missed
an
opportunity
of
introducing
it
,
*NL*
and
was
particularly
careful
to
inform
her
confidante
,
of
her
happiness
*NL*
whenever
she
received
a
letter
from
Edward
,
it
was
treated
by
the
*NL*
former
with
calmness
and
caution
,
and
dismissed
as
soon
as
civility
*NL*
would
allow
;
for
she
felt
such
conversations
to
be
an
indulgence
which
*NL*
Lucy
did
not
deserve
,
and
which
were
dangerous
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visit
of
the
Miss
Steeles
at
Barton
Park
was
lengthened
far
beyond
*NL*
what
the
first
invitation
implied
.
Their
favour
increased
;
they
could
*NL*
not
be
spared
;
Sir
John
would
not
hear
of
their
going
;
and
in
spite
of
*NL*
their
numerous
and
long
arranged
engagements
in
Exeter
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
absolute
necessity
of
returning
to
fulfill
them
immediately
,
which
was
*NL*
in
full
force
at
the
end
of
every
week
,
they
were
prevailed
on
to
stay
*NL*
nearly
two
months
at
the
park
,
and
to
assist
in
the
due
celebration
of
*NL*
that
festival
which
requires
a
more
than
ordinary
share
of
private
*NL*
balls
and
large
dinners
to
proclaim
its
importance
.

CHAPTER
25
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Mrs.
Jennings
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
a
large
portion
of
*NL*
the
year
at
the
houses
of
her
children
and
friends
,
she
was
not
without
*NL*
a
settled
habitation
of
her
own
.
Since
the
death
of
her
husband
,
who
*NL*
had
traded
with
success
in
a
less
elegant
part
of
the
town
,
she
had
*NL*
resided
every
winter
in
a
house
in
one
of
the
streets
near
Portman
*NL*
Square
.
Towards
this
home
,
she
began
on
the
approach
of
January
to
*NL*
turn
her
thoughts
,
and
thither
she
one
day
abruptly
,
and
very
*NL*
unexpectedly
by
them
,
asked
the
elder
Misses
Dashwood
to
accompany
her
.
*NL*
Elinor
,
without
observing
the
varying
complexion
of
her
sister
,
and
the
*NL*
animated
look
which
spoke
no
indifference
to
the
plan
,
immediately
gave
*NL*
a
grateful
but
absolute
denial
for
both
,
in
which
she
believed
herself
*NL*
to
be
speaking
their
united
inclinations
.
The
reason
alleged
was
their
*NL*
determined
resolution
of
not
leaving
their
mother
at
that
time
of
the
*NL*
year
.
Mrs.
Jennings
received
the
refusal
with
some
surprise
,
and
*NL*
repeated
her
invitation
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lord
!
I
am
sure
your
mother
can
spare
you
very
well
,
and
I
DO
beg
*NL*
you
will
favour
me
with
your
company
,
for
I
've
quite
set
my
heart
upon
*NL*
it
.
Do
n't
fancy
that
you
will
be
any
inconvenience
to
me
,
for
I
sha
n't
*NL*
put
myself
at
all
out
of
my
way
for
you
.
It
will
only
be
sending
Betty
*NL*
by
the
coach
,
and
I
hope
I
can
afford
THAT
.
We
three
shall
be
able
to
*NL*
go
very
well
in
my
chaise
;
and
when
we
are
in
town
,
if
you
do
not
like
*NL*
to
go
wherever
I
do
,
well
and
good
,
you
may
always
go
with
one
of
my
*NL*
daughters
.
I
am
sure
your
mother
will
not
object
to
it
;
for
I
have
had
*NL*
such
good
luck
in
getting
my
own
children
off
my
hands
that
she
will
*NL*
think
me
a
very
fit
person
to
have
the
charge
of
you
;
and
if
I
do
n't
*NL*
get
one
of
you
at
least
well
married
before
I
have
done
with
you
,
it
*NL*
shall
not
be
my
fault
.
I
shall
speak
a
good
word
for
you
to
all
the
*NL*
young
men
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
notion
,
''
said
Sir
John
,
``
that
Miss
Marianne
would
not
object
*NL*
to
such
a
scheme
,
if
her
elder
sister
would
come
into
it
.
It
is
very
*NL*
hard
indeed
that
she
should
not
have
a
little
pleasure
,
because
Miss
*NL*
Dashwood
does
not
wish
it
.
So
I
would
advise
you
two
,
to
set
off
for
*NL*
town
,
when
you
are
tired
of
Barton
,
without
saying
a
word
to
Miss
*NL*
Dashwood
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Jennings
,
``
I
am
sure
I
shall
be
monstrous
glad
of
*NL*
Miss
Marianne
's
company
,
whether
Miss
Dashwood
will
go
or
not
,
only
the
*NL*
more
the
merrier
say
I
,
and
I
thought
it
would
be
more
comfortable
for
*NL*
them
to
be
together
;
because
,
if
they
got
tired
of
me
,
they
might
talk
*NL*
to
one
another
,
and
laugh
at
my
old
ways
behind
my
back
.
But
one
or
*NL*
the
other
,
if
not
both
of
them
,
I
must
have
.
Lord
bless
me
!
how
do
you
*NL*
think
I
can
live
poking
by
myself
,
I
who
have
been
always
used
till
*NL*
this
winter
to
have
Charlotte
with
me
.
Come
,
Miss
Marianne
,
let
us
*NL*
strike
hands
upon
the
bargain
,
and
if
Miss
Dashwood
will
change
her
*NL*
mind
by
and
bye
,
why
so
much
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
ma'am
,
sincerely
thank
you
,
''
said
Marianne
,
with
warmth
:
*NL*
``
your
invitation
has
insured
my
gratitude
for
ever
,
and
it
would
give
*NL*
me
such
happiness
,
yes
,
almost
the
greatest
happiness
I
am
capable
of
,
*NL*
to
be
able
to
accept
it
.
But
my
mother
,
my
dearest
,
kindest
mother
,
--
I
*NL*
feel
the
justice
of
what
Elinor
has
urged
,
and
if
she
were
to
be
made
*NL*
less
happy
,
less
comfortable
by
our
absence
--
Oh
!
no
,
nothing
should
*NL*
tempt
me
to
leave
her
.
It
should
not
,
must
not
be
a
struggle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
repeated
her
assurance
that
Mrs.
Dashwood
could
spare
*NL*
them
perfectly
well
;
and
Elinor
,
who
now
understood
her
sister
,
and
saw
*NL*
to
what
indifference
to
almost
every
thing
else
she
was
carried
by
her
*NL*
eagerness
to
be
with
Willoughby
again
,
made
no
farther
direct
*NL*
opposition
to
the
plan
,
and
merely
referred
it
to
her
mother
's
*NL*
decision
,
from
whom
however
she
scarcely
expected
to
receive
any
*NL*
support
in
her
endeavour
to
prevent
a
visit
,
which
she
could
not
*NL*
approve
of
for
Marianne
,
and
which
on
her
own
account
she
had
*NL*
particular
reasons
to
avoid
.
Whatever
Marianne
was
desirous
of
,
her
*NL*
mother
would
be
eager
to
promote
--
she
could
not
expect
to
influence
the
*NL*
latter
to
cautiousness
of
conduct
in
an
affair
respecting
which
she
had
*NL*
never
been
able
to
inspire
her
with
distrust
;
and
she
dared
not
explain
*NL*
the
motive
of
her
own
disinclination
for
going
to
London
.
That
*NL*
Marianne
,
fastidious
as
she
was
,
thoroughly
acquainted
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
'
manners
,
and
invariably
disgusted
by
them
,
should
overlook
*NL*
every
inconvenience
of
that
kind
,
should
disregard
whatever
must
be
*NL*
most
wounding
to
her
irritable
feelings
,
in
her
pursuit
of
one
object
,
*NL*
was
such
a
proof
,
so
strong
,
so
full
,
of
the
importance
of
that
object
*NL*
to
her
,
as
Elinor
,
in
spite
of
all
that
had
passed
,
was
not
prepared
to
*NL*
witness
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
being
informed
of
the
invitation
,
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
persuaded
that
such
*NL*
an
excursion
would
be
productive
of
much
amusement
to
both
her
*NL*
daughters
,
and
perceiving
through
all
her
affectionate
attention
to
*NL*
herself
,
how
much
the
heart
of
Marianne
was
in
it
,
would
not
hear
of
*NL*
their
declining
the
offer
upon
HER
account
;
insisted
on
their
both
*NL*
accepting
it
directly
;
and
then
began
to
foresee
,
with
her
usual
*NL*
cheerfulness
,
a
variety
of
advantages
that
would
accrue
to
them
all
,
*NL*
from
this
separation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
delighted
with
the
plan
,
''
she
cried
,
``
it
is
exactly
what
I
could
*NL*
wish
.
Margaret
and
I
shall
be
as
much
benefited
by
it
as
yourselves
.
*NL*
When
you
and
the
Middletons
are
gone
,
we
shall
go
on
so
quietly
and
*NL*
happily
together
with
our
books
and
our
music
!
You
will
find
Margaret
*NL*
so
improved
when
you
come
back
again
!
I
have
a
little
plan
of
*NL*
alteration
for
your
bedrooms
too
,
which
may
now
be
performed
without
*NL*
any
inconvenience
to
any
one
.
It
is
very
right
that
you
SHOULD
go
to
*NL*
town
;
I
would
have
every
young
woman
of
your
condition
in
life
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
manners
and
amusements
of
London
.
You
will
be
*NL*
under
the
care
of
a
motherly
good
sort
of
woman
,
of
whose
kindness
to
*NL*
you
I
can
have
no
doubt
.
And
in
all
probability
you
will
see
your
*NL*
brother
,
and
whatever
may
be
his
faults
,
or
the
faults
of
his
wife
,
*NL*
when
I
consider
whose
son
he
is
,
I
can
not
bear
to
have
you
so
wholly
*NL*
estranged
from
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
with
your
usual
anxiety
for
our
happiness
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
you
*NL*
have
been
obviating
every
impediment
to
the
present
scheme
which
*NL*
occurred
to
you
,
there
is
still
one
objection
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
*NL*
can
not
be
so
easily
removed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
's
countenance
sunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
``
is
my
dear
prudent
Elinor
going
to
*NL*
suggest
?
What
formidable
obstacle
is
she
now
to
bring
forward
?
Do
let
*NL*
me
hear
a
word
about
the
expense
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
objection
is
this
;
though
I
think
very
well
of
Mrs.
Jennings
's
*NL*
heart
,
she
is
not
a
woman
whose
society
can
afford
us
pleasure
,
or
*NL*
whose
protection
will
give
us
consequence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
true
,
''
replied
her
mother
,
``
but
of
her
society
,
*NL*
separately
from
that
of
other
people
,
you
will
scarcely
have
any
thing
*NL*
at
all
,
and
you
will
almost
always
appear
in
public
with
Lady
*NL*
Middleton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Elinor
is
frightened
away
by
her
dislike
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
''
said
*NL*
Marianne
,
``
at
least
it
need
not
prevent
MY
accepting
her
invitation
.
I
*NL*
have
no
such
scruples
,
and
I
am
sure
I
could
put
up
with
every
*NL*
unpleasantness
of
that
kind
with
very
little
effort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
not
help
smiling
at
this
display
of
indifference
towards
*NL*
the
manners
of
a
person
,
to
whom
she
had
often
had
difficulty
in
*NL*
persuading
Marianne
to
behave
with
tolerable
politeness
;
and
resolved
*NL*
within
herself
,
that
if
her
sister
persisted
in
going
,
she
would
go
*NL*
likewise
,
as
she
did
not
think
it
proper
that
Marianne
should
be
left
*NL*
to
the
sole
guidance
of
her
own
judgment
,
or
that
Mrs.
Jennings
should
*NL*
be
abandoned
to
the
mercy
of
Marianne
for
all
the
comfort
of
her
*NL*
domestic
hours
.
To
this
determination
she
was
the
more
easily
*NL*
reconciled
,
by
recollecting
that
Edward
Ferrars
,
by
Lucy
's
account
,
was
*NL*
not
to
be
in
town
before
February
;
and
that
their
visit
,
without
any
*NL*
unreasonable
abridgement
,
might
be
previously
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
have
you
BOTH
go
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dashwood
;
``
these
objections
are
*NL*
nonsensical
.
You
will
have
much
pleasure
in
being
in
London
,
and
*NL*
especially
in
being
together
;
and
if
Elinor
would
ever
condescend
to
*NL*
anticipate
enjoyment
,
she
would
foresee
it
there
from
a
variety
of
*NL*
sources
;
she
would
,
perhaps
,
expect
some
from
improving
her
*NL*
acquaintance
with
her
sister-in-law
's
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
had
often
wished
for
an
opportunity
of
attempting
to
weaken
her
*NL*
mother
's
dependence
on
the
attachment
of
Edward
and
herself
,
that
the
*NL*
shock
might
be
less
when
the
whole
truth
were
revealed
,
and
now
on
this
*NL*
attack
,
though
almost
hopeless
of
success
,
she
forced
herself
to
begin
*NL*
her
design
by
saying
,
as
calmly
as
she
could
,
``
I
like
Edward
Ferrars
*NL*
very
much
,
and
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
him
;
but
as
to
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
family
,
it
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
,
whether
I
am
*NL*
ever
known
to
them
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
smiled
,
and
said
nothing
.
Marianne
lifted
up
her
eyes
in
*NL*
astonishment
,
and
Elinor
conjectured
that
she
might
as
well
have
held
*NL*
her
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
very
little
farther
discourse
,
it
was
finally
settled
that
the
*NL*
invitation
should
be
fully
accepted
.
Mrs.
Jennings
received
the
*NL*
information
with
a
great
deal
of
joy
,
and
many
assurances
of
kindness
*NL*
and
care
;
nor
was
it
a
matter
of
pleasure
merely
to
her
.
Sir
John
was
*NL*
delighted
;
for
to
a
man
,
whose
prevailing
anxiety
was
the
dread
of
*NL*
being
alone
,
the
acquisition
of
two
,
to
the
number
of
inhabitants
in
*NL*
London
,
was
something
.
Even
Lady
Middleton
took
the
trouble
of
being
*NL*
delighted
,
which
was
putting
herself
rather
out
of
her
way
;
and
as
for
*NL*
the
Miss
Steeles
,
especially
Lucy
,
they
had
never
been
so
happy
in
*NL*
their
lives
as
this
intelligence
made
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
submitted
to
the
arrangement
which
counteracted
her
wishes
with
*NL*
less
reluctance
than
she
had
expected
to
feel
.
With
regard
to
herself
,
*NL*
it
was
now
a
matter
of
unconcern
whether
she
went
to
town
or
not
,
and
*NL*
when
she
saw
her
mother
so
thoroughly
pleased
with
the
plan
,
and
her
*NL*
sister
exhilarated
by
it
in
look
,
voice
,
and
manner
,
restored
to
all
*NL*
her
usual
animation
,
and
elevated
to
more
than
her
usual
gaiety
,
she
*NL*
could
not
be
dissatisfied
with
the
cause
,
and
would
hardly
allow
*NL*
herself
to
distrust
the
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
's
joy
was
almost
a
degree
beyond
happiness
,
so
great
was
the
*NL*
perturbation
of
her
spirits
and
her
impatience
to
be
gone
.
Her
*NL*
unwillingness
to
quit
her
mother
was
her
only
restorative
to
calmness
;
*NL*
and
at
the
moment
of
parting
her
grief
on
that
score
was
excessive
.
*NL*
Her
mother
's
affliction
was
hardly
less
,
and
Elinor
was
the
only
one
of
*NL*
the
three
,
who
seemed
to
consider
the
separation
as
any
thing
short
of
*NL*
eternal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
departure
took
place
in
the
first
week
in
January
.
The
*NL*
Middletons
were
to
follow
in
about
a
week
.
The
Miss
Steeles
kept
their
*NL*
station
at
the
park
,
and
were
to
quit
it
only
with
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
family
.

CHAPTER
26
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
not
find
herself
in
the
carriage
with
Mrs.
Jennings
,
and
*NL*
beginning
a
journey
to
London
under
her
protection
,
and
as
her
guest
,
*NL*
without
wondering
at
her
own
situation
,
so
short
had
their
acquaintance
*NL*
with
that
lady
been
,
so
wholly
unsuited
were
they
in
age
and
*NL*
disposition
,
and
so
many
had
been
her
objections
against
such
a
measure
*NL*
only
a
few
days
before
!
But
these
objections
had
all
,
with
that
happy
*NL*
ardour
of
youth
which
Marianne
and
her
mother
equally
shared
,
been
*NL*
overcome
or
overlooked
;
and
Elinor
,
in
spite
of
every
occasional
doubt
*NL*
of
Willoughby
's
constancy
,
could
not
witness
the
rapture
of
delightful
*NL*
expectation
which
filled
the
whole
soul
and
beamed
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
Marianne
,
without
feeling
how
blank
was
her
own
prospect
,
how
cheerless
*NL*
her
own
state
of
mind
in
the
comparison
,
and
how
gladly
she
would
*NL*
engage
in
the
solicitude
of
Marianne
's
situation
to
have
the
same
*NL*
animating
object
in
view
,
the
same
possibility
of
hope
.
A
short
,
a
*NL*
very
short
time
however
must
now
decide
what
Willoughby
's
intentions
*NL*
were
;
in
all
probability
he
was
already
in
town
.
Marianne
's
eagerness
*NL*
to
be
gone
declared
her
dependence
on
finding
him
there
;
and
Elinor
was
*NL*
resolved
not
only
upon
gaining
every
new
light
as
to
his
character
*NL*
which
her
own
observation
or
the
intelligence
of
others
could
give
her
,
*NL*
but
likewise
upon
watching
his
behaviour
to
her
sister
with
such
*NL*
zealous
attention
,
as
to
ascertain
what
he
was
and
what
he
meant
,
*NL*
before
many
meetings
had
taken
place
.
Should
the
result
of
her
*NL*
observations
be
unfavourable
,
she
was
determined
at
all
events
to
open
*NL*
the
eyes
of
her
sister
;
should
it
be
otherwise
,
her
exertions
would
be
*NL*
of
a
different
nature
--
she
must
then
learn
to
avoid
every
selfish
*NL*
comparison
,
and
banish
every
regret
which
might
lessen
her
satisfaction
*NL*
in
the
happiness
of
Marianne
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
three
days
on
their
journey
,
and
Marianne
's
behaviour
as
they
*NL*
travelled
was
a
happy
specimen
of
what
future
complaisance
and
*NL*
companionableness
to
Mrs.
Jennings
might
be
expected
to
be
.
She
sat
in
*NL*
silence
almost
all
the
way
,
wrapt
in
her
own
meditations
,
and
scarcely
*NL*
ever
voluntarily
speaking
,
except
when
any
object
of
picturesque
beauty
*NL*
within
their
view
drew
from
her
an
exclamation
of
delight
exclusively
*NL*
addressed
to
her
sister
.
To
atone
for
this
conduct
therefore
,
Elinor
*NL*
took
immediate
possession
of
the
post
of
civility
which
she
had
*NL*
assigned
herself
,
behaved
with
the
greatest
attention
to
Mrs.
Jennings
,
*NL*
talked
with
her
,
laughed
with
her
,
and
listened
to
her
whenever
she
*NL*
could
;
and
Mrs.
Jennings
on
her
side
treated
them
both
with
all
*NL*
possible
kindness
,
was
solicitous
on
every
occasion
for
their
ease
and
*NL*
enjoyment
,
and
only
disturbed
that
she
could
not
make
them
choose
their
*NL*
own
dinners
at
the
inn
,
nor
extort
a
confession
of
their
preferring
*NL*
salmon
to
cod
,
or
boiled
fowls
to
veal
cutlets
.
They
reached
town
by
*NL*
three
o'clock
the
third
day
,
glad
to
be
released
,
after
such
a
journey
,
*NL*
from
the
confinement
of
a
carriage
,
and
ready
to
enjoy
all
the
luxury
*NL*
of
a
good
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
was
handsome
,
and
handsomely
fitted
up
,
and
the
young
ladies
*NL*
were
immediately
put
in
possession
of
a
very
comfortable
apartment
.
It
*NL*
had
formerly
been
Charlotte
's
,
and
over
the
mantelpiece
still
hung
a
*NL*
landscape
in
coloured
silks
of
her
performance
,
in
proof
of
her
having
*NL*
spent
seven
years
at
a
great
school
in
town
to
some
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
dinner
was
not
to
be
ready
in
less
than
two
hours
from
their
*NL*
arrival
,
Elinor
determined
to
employ
the
interval
in
writing
to
her
*NL*
mother
,
and
sat
down
for
that
purpose
.
In
a
few
moments
Marianne
did
*NL*
the
same
.
``
I
am
writing
home
,
Marianne
,
''
said
Elinor
;
``
had
not
you
*NL*
better
defer
your
letter
for
a
day
or
two
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
NOT
going
to
write
to
my
mother
,
''
replied
Marianne
,
hastily
,
and
*NL*
as
if
wishing
to
avoid
any
farther
inquiry
.
Elinor
said
no
more
;
it
*NL*
immediately
struck
her
that
she
must
then
be
writing
to
Willoughby
;
and
*NL*
the
conclusion
which
as
instantly
followed
was
,
that
,
however
*NL*
mysteriously
they
might
wish
to
conduct
the
affair
,
they
must
be
*NL*
engaged
.
This
conviction
,
though
not
entirely
satisfactory
,
gave
her
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
she
continued
her
letter
with
greater
alacrity
.
*NL*
Marianne
's
was
finished
in
a
very
few
minutes
;
in
length
it
could
be
no
*NL*
more
than
a
note
;
it
was
then
folded
up
,
sealed
,
and
directed
with
*NL*
eager
rapidity
.
Elinor
thought
she
could
distinguish
a
large
W
in
the
*NL*
direction
;
and
no
sooner
was
it
complete
than
Marianne
,
ringing
the
*NL*
bell
,
requested
the
footman
who
answered
it
to
get
that
letter
conveyed
*NL*
for
her
to
the
two-penny
post
.
This
decided
the
matter
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
spirits
still
continued
very
high
;
but
there
was
a
flutter
in
them
*NL*
which
prevented
their
giving
much
pleasure
to
her
sister
,
and
this
*NL*
agitation
increased
as
the
evening
drew
on
.
She
could
scarcely
eat
any
*NL*
dinner
,
and
when
they
afterwards
returned
to
the
drawing
room
,
seemed
*NL*
anxiously
listening
to
the
sound
of
every
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
Elinor
that
Mrs.
Jennings
,
by
being
much
*NL*
engaged
in
her
own
room
,
could
see
little
of
what
was
passing
.
The
tea
*NL*
things
were
brought
in
,
and
already
had
Marianne
been
disappointed
more
*NL*
than
once
by
a
rap
at
a
neighbouring
door
,
when
a
loud
one
was
suddenly
*NL*
heard
which
could
not
be
mistaken
for
one
at
any
other
house
,
Elinor
*NL*
felt
secure
of
its
announcing
Willoughby
's
approach
,
and
Marianne
,
*NL*
starting
up
,
moved
towards
the
door
.
Every
thing
was
silent
;
this
*NL*
could
not
be
borne
many
seconds
;
she
opened
the
door
,
advanced
a
few
*NL*
steps
towards
the
stairs
,
and
after
listening
half
a
minute
,
returned
*NL*
into
the
room
in
all
the
agitation
which
a
conviction
of
having
heard
*NL*
him
would
naturally
produce
;
in
the
ecstasy
of
her
feelings
at
that
*NL*
instant
she
could
not
help
exclaiming
,
``
Oh
,
Elinor
,
it
is
Willoughby
,
*NL*
indeed
it
is
!
''
and
seemed
almost
ready
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
,
*NL*
when
Colonel
Brandon
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
too
great
a
shock
to
be
borne
with
calmness
,
and
she
immediately
*NL*
left
the
room
.
Elinor
was
disappointed
too
;
but
at
the
same
time
her
*NL*
regard
for
Colonel
Brandon
ensured
his
welcome
with
her
;
and
she
felt
*NL*
particularly
hurt
that
a
man
so
partial
to
her
sister
should
perceive
*NL*
that
she
experienced
nothing
but
grief
and
disappointment
in
seeing
*NL*
him
.
She
instantly
saw
that
it
was
not
unnoticed
by
him
,
that
he
even
*NL*
observed
Marianne
as
she
quitted
the
room
,
with
such
astonishment
and
*NL*
concern
,
as
hardly
left
him
the
recollection
of
what
civility
demanded
*NL*
towards
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
sister
ill
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
answered
in
some
distress
that
she
was
,
and
then
talked
of
*NL*
head-aches
,
low
spirits
,
and
over
fatigues
;
and
of
every
thing
to
which
*NL*
she
could
decently
attribute
her
sister
's
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
her
with
the
most
earnest
attention
,
but
seeming
to
recollect
*NL*
himself
,
said
no
more
on
the
subject
,
and
began
directly
to
speak
of
*NL*
his
pleasure
at
seeing
them
in
London
,
making
the
usual
inquiries
about
*NL*
their
journey
,
and
the
friends
they
had
left
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
calm
kind
of
way
,
with
very
little
interest
on
either
side
,
*NL*
they
continued
to
talk
,
both
of
them
out
of
spirits
,
and
the
thoughts
*NL*
of
both
engaged
elsewhere
.
Elinor
wished
very
much
to
ask
whether
*NL*
Willoughby
were
then
in
town
,
but
she
was
afraid
of
giving
him
pain
by
*NL*
any
enquiry
after
his
rival
;
and
at
length
,
by
way
of
saying
something
,
*NL*
she
asked
if
he
had
been
in
London
ever
since
she
had
seen
him
last
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
replied
,
with
some
embarrassment
,
``
almost
ever
since
;
I
have
*NL*
been
once
or
twice
at
Delaford
for
a
few
days
,
but
it
has
never
been
in
*NL*
my
power
to
return
to
Barton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
said
,
immediately
brought
back
to
*NL*
her
remembrance
all
the
circumstances
of
his
quitting
that
place
,
with
*NL*
the
uneasiness
and
suspicions
they
had
caused
to
Mrs.
Jennings
,
and
she
*NL*
was
fearful
that
her
question
had
implied
much
more
curiosity
on
the
*NL*
subject
than
she
had
ever
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
soon
came
in
.
``
Oh
!
Colonel
,
''
said
she
,
with
her
usual
*NL*
noisy
cheerfulness
,
``
I
am
monstrous
glad
to
see
you
--
sorry
I
could
not
*NL*
come
before
--
beg
your
pardon
,
but
I
have
been
forced
to
look
about
me
a
*NL*
little
,
and
settle
my
matters
;
for
it
is
a
long
while
since
I
have
been
*NL*
at
home
,
and
you
know
one
has
always
a
world
of
little
odd
things
to
do
*NL*
after
one
has
been
away
for
any
time
;
and
then
I
have
had
Cartwright
to
*NL*
settle
with
--
Lord
,
I
have
been
as
busy
as
a
bee
ever
since
dinner
!
*NL*
But
pray
,
Colonel
,
how
came
you
to
conjure
out
that
I
should
be
in
town
*NL*
today
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
it
at
Mr.
Palmer
's
,
where
I
have
been
*NL*
dining
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
did
;
well
,
and
how
do
they
all
do
at
their
house
?
How
does
*NL*
Charlotte
do
?
I
warrant
you
she
is
a
fine
size
by
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Palmer
appeared
quite
well
,
and
I
am
commissioned
to
tell
you
,
*NL*
that
you
will
certainly
see
her
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
to
be
sure
,
I
thought
as
much
.
Well
,
Colonel
,
I
have
brought
two
*NL*
young
ladies
with
me
,
you
see
--
that
is
,
you
see
but
one
of
them
now
,
*NL*
but
there
is
another
somewhere
.
Your
friend
,
Miss
Marianne
,
too
--
which
*NL*
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
hear
.
I
do
not
know
what
you
and
Mr.
*NL*
Willoughby
will
do
between
you
about
her
.
Ay
,
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
*NL*
young
and
handsome
.
Well
!
I
was
young
once
,
but
I
never
was
very
*NL*
handsome
--
worse
luck
for
me
.
However
,
I
got
a
very
good
husband
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
the
greatest
beauty
can
do
more
.
Ah
!
poor
man
!
he
has
*NL*
been
dead
these
eight
years
and
better
.
But
Colonel
,
where
have
you
*NL*
been
to
since
we
parted
?
And
how
does
your
business
go
on
?
Come
,
*NL*
come
,
let
's
have
no
secrets
among
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
with
his
accustomary
mildness
to
all
her
inquiries
,
but
*NL*
without
satisfying
her
in
any
.
Elinor
now
began
to
make
the
tea
,
and
*NL*
Marianne
was
obliged
to
appear
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
her
entrance
,
Colonel
Brandon
became
more
thoughtful
and
silent
*NL*
than
he
had
been
before
,
and
Mrs.
Jennings
could
not
prevail
on
him
to
*NL*
stay
long
.
No
other
visitor
appeared
that
evening
,
and
the
ladies
were
*NL*
unanimous
in
agreeing
to
go
early
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
rose
the
next
morning
with
recovered
spirits
and
happy
looks
.
*NL*
The
disappointment
of
the
evening
before
seemed
forgotten
in
the
*NL*
expectation
of
what
was
to
happen
that
day
.
They
had
not
long
finished
*NL*
their
breakfast
before
Mrs.
Palmer
's
barouche
stopped
at
the
door
,
and
*NL*
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
laughing
into
the
room
:
so
delighted
to
see
*NL*
them
all
,
that
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
she
received
most
pleasure
*NL*
from
meeting
her
mother
or
the
Miss
Dashwoods
again
.
So
surprised
at
*NL*
their
coming
to
town
,
though
it
was
what
she
had
rather
expected
all
*NL*
along
;
so
angry
at
their
accepting
her
mother
's
invitation
after
having
*NL*
declined
her
own
,
though
at
the
same
time
she
would
never
have
forgiven
*NL*
them
if
they
had
not
come
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Palmer
will
be
so
happy
to
see
you
,
''
said
she
;
``
What
do
you
think
*NL*
he
said
when
he
heard
of
your
coming
with
Mama
?
I
forget
what
it
was
*NL*
now
,
but
it
was
something
so
droll
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
hour
or
two
spent
in
what
her
mother
called
comfortable
chat
,
*NL*
or
in
other
words
,
in
every
variety
of
inquiry
concerning
all
their
*NL*
acquaintance
on
Mrs.
Jennings
's
side
,
and
in
laughter
without
cause
on
*NL*
Mrs.
Palmer
's
,
it
was
proposed
by
the
latter
that
they
should
all
*NL*
accompany
her
to
some
shops
where
she
had
business
that
morning
,
to
*NL*
which
Mrs.
Jennings
and
Elinor
readily
consented
,
as
having
likewise
*NL*
some
purchases
to
make
themselves
;
and
Marianne
,
though
declining
it
at
*NL*
first
was
induced
to
go
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wherever
they
went
,
she
was
evidently
always
on
the
watch
.
In
Bond
*NL*
Street
especially
,
where
much
of
their
business
lay
,
her
eyes
were
in
*NL*
constant
inquiry
;
and
in
whatever
shop
the
party
were
engaged
,
her
mind
*NL*
was
equally
abstracted
from
every
thing
actually
before
them
,
from
all
*NL*
that
interested
and
occupied
the
others
.
Restless
and
dissatisfied
*NL*
every
where
,
her
sister
could
never
obtain
her
opinion
of
any
article
*NL*
of
purchase
,
however
it
might
equally
concern
them
both
:
she
received
*NL*
no
pleasure
from
anything
;
was
only
impatient
to
be
at
home
again
,
and
*NL*
could
with
difficulty
govern
her
vexation
at
the
tediousness
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Palmer
,
whose
eye
was
caught
by
every
thing
pretty
,
expensive
,
or
new
;
*NL*
who
was
wild
to
buy
all
,
could
determine
on
none
,
and
dawdled
away
her
*NL*
time
in
rapture
and
indecision
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
in
the
morning
before
they
returned
home
;
and
no
sooner
had
*NL*
they
entered
the
house
than
Marianne
flew
eagerly
up
stairs
,
and
when
*NL*
Elinor
followed
,
she
found
her
turning
from
the
table
with
a
sorrowful
*NL*
countenance
,
which
declared
that
no
Willoughby
had
been
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
no
letter
been
left
here
for
me
since
we
went
out
?
''
said
she
to
*NL*
the
footman
who
then
entered
with
the
parcels
.
She
was
answered
in
the
*NL*
negative
.
``
Are
you
quite
sure
of
it
?
''
she
replied
.
``
Are
you
certain
*NL*
that
no
servant
,
no
porter
has
left
any
letter
or
note
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
replied
that
none
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
very
odd
!
''
said
she
,
in
a
low
and
disappointed
voice
,
as
she
*NL*
turned
away
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
odd
,
indeed
!
''
repeated
Elinor
within
herself
,
regarding
her
sister
*NL*
with
uneasiness
.
``
If
she
had
not
known
him
to
be
in
town
she
would
not
*NL*
have
written
to
him
,
as
she
did
;
she
would
have
written
to
Combe
Magna
;
*NL*
and
if
he
is
in
town
,
how
odd
that
he
should
neither
come
nor
write
!
*NL*
Oh
!
my
dear
mother
,
you
must
be
wrong
in
permitting
an
engagement
*NL*
between
a
daughter
so
young
,
a
man
so
little
known
,
to
be
carried
on
in
*NL*
so
doubtful
,
so
mysterious
a
manner
!
I
long
to
inquire
;
and
how
will
*NL*
MY
interference
be
borne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
determined
,
after
some
consideration
,
that
if
appearances
continued
*NL*
many
days
longer
as
unpleasant
as
they
now
were
,
she
would
represent
in
*NL*
the
strongest
manner
to
her
mother
the
necessity
of
some
serious
*NL*
enquiry
into
the
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Palmer
and
two
elderly
ladies
of
Mrs.
Jennings
's
intimate
*NL*
acquaintance
,
whom
she
had
met
and
invited
in
the
morning
,
dined
with
*NL*
them
.
The
former
left
them
soon
after
tea
to
fulfill
her
evening
*NL*
engagements
;
and
Elinor
was
obliged
to
assist
in
making
a
whist
table
*NL*
for
the
others
.
Marianne
was
of
no
use
on
these
occasions
,
as
she
*NL*
would
never
learn
the
game
;
but
though
her
time
was
therefore
at
her
*NL*
own
disposal
,
the
evening
was
by
no
means
more
productive
of
pleasure
*NL*
to
her
than
to
Elinor
,
for
it
was
spent
in
all
the
anxiety
of
*NL*
expectation
and
the
pain
of
disappointment
.
She
sometimes
endeavoured
*NL*
for
a
few
minutes
to
read
;
but
the
book
was
soon
thrown
aside
,
and
she
*NL*
returned
to
the
more
interesting
employment
of
walking
backwards
and
*NL*
forwards
across
the
room
,
pausing
for
a
moment
whenever
she
came
to
the
*NL*
window
,
in
hopes
of
distinguishing
the
long-expected
rap
.

CHAPTER
27
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
open
weather
holds
much
longer
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jennings
,
when
they
*NL*
met
at
breakfast
the
following
morning
,
``
Sir
John
will
not
like
leaving
*NL*
Barton
next
week
;
't
is
a
sad
thing
for
sportsmen
to
lose
a
day
's
*NL*
pleasure
.
Poor
souls
!
I
always
pity
them
when
they
do
;
they
seem
to
*NL*
take
it
so
much
to
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
cried
Marianne
,
in
a
cheerful
voice
,
and
walking
to
the
*NL*
window
as
she
spoke
,
to
examine
the
day
.
``
I
had
not
thought
of
that
.
*NL*
This
weather
will
keep
many
sportsmen
in
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
lucky
recollection
,
all
her
good
spirits
were
restored
by
it
.
*NL*
``
It
is
charming
weather
for
THEM
indeed
,
''
she
continued
,
as
she
sat
*NL*
down
to
the
breakfast
table
with
a
happy
countenance
.
``
How
much
they
*NL*
must
enjoy
it
!
But
''
-LRB-
with
a
little
return
of
anxiety
-RRB-
``
it
can
not
be
*NL*
expected
to
last
long
.
At
this
time
of
the
year
,
and
after
such
a
*NL*
series
of
rain
,
we
shall
certainly
have
very
little
more
of
it
.
Frosts
*NL*
will
soon
set
in
,
and
in
all
probability
with
severity
.
In
another
day
*NL*
or
two
perhaps
;
this
extreme
mildness
can
hardly
last
longer
--
nay
,
*NL*
perhaps
it
may
freeze
tonight
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
''
said
Elinor
,
wishing
to
prevent
Mrs.
Jennings
from
*NL*
seeing
her
sister
's
thoughts
as
clearly
as
she
did
,
``
I
dare
say
we
*NL*
shall
have
Sir
John
and
Lady
Middleton
in
town
by
the
end
of
next
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
my
dear
,
I
'll
warrant
you
we
do
.
Mary
always
has
her
own
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
silently
conjectured
Elinor
,
``
she
will
write
to
Combe
by
*NL*
this
day
's
post
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
she
DID
,
the
letter
was
written
and
sent
away
with
a
privacy
*NL*
which
eluded
all
her
watchfulness
to
ascertain
the
fact
.
Whatever
the
*NL*
truth
of
it
might
be
,
and
far
as
Elinor
was
from
feeling
thorough
*NL*
contentment
about
it
,
yet
while
she
saw
Marianne
in
spirits
,
she
could
*NL*
not
be
very
uncomfortable
herself
.
And
Marianne
was
in
spirits
;
happy
*NL*
in
the
mildness
of
the
weather
,
and
still
happier
in
her
expectation
of
*NL*
a
frost
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
was
chiefly
spent
in
leaving
cards
at
the
houses
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
's
acquaintance
to
inform
them
of
her
being
in
town
;
and
*NL*
Marianne
was
all
the
time
busy
in
observing
the
direction
of
the
wind
,
*NL*
watching
the
variations
of
the
sky
and
imagining
an
alteration
in
the
*NL*
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
find
it
colder
than
it
was
in
the
morning
,
Elinor
?
There
*NL*
seems
to
me
a
very
decided
difference
.
I
can
hardly
keep
my
hands
warm
*NL*
even
in
my
muff
.
It
was
not
so
yesterday
,
I
think
.
The
clouds
seem
*NL*
parting
too
,
the
sun
will
be
out
in
a
moment
,
and
we
shall
have
a
clear
*NL*
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
was
alternately
diverted
and
pained
;
but
Marianne
persevered
,
*NL*
and
saw
every
night
in
the
brightness
of
the
fire
,
and
every
morning
in
*NL*
the
appearance
of
the
atmosphere
,
the
certain
symptoms
of
approaching
*NL*
frost
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Dashwoods
had
no
greater
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
's
style
of
living
,
and
set
of
acquaintance
,
than
with
her
*NL*
behaviour
to
themselves
,
which
was
invariably
kind
.
Every
thing
in
her
*NL*
household
arrangements
was
conducted
on
the
most
liberal
plan
,
and
*NL*
excepting
a
few
old
city
friends
,
whom
,
to
Lady
Middleton
's
regret
,
she
*NL*
had
never
dropped
,
she
visited
no
one
to
whom
an
introduction
could
at
*NL*
all
discompose
the
feelings
of
her
young
companions
.
Pleased
to
find
*NL*
herself
more
comfortably
situated
in
that
particular
than
she
had
*NL*
expected
,
Elinor
was
very
willing
to
compound
for
the
want
of
much
real
*NL*
enjoyment
from
any
of
their
evening
parties
,
which
,
whether
at
home
or
*NL*
abroad
,
formed
only
for
cards
,
could
have
little
to
amuse
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
,
who
had
a
general
invitation
to
the
house
,
was
with
*NL*
them
almost
every
day
;
he
came
to
look
at
Marianne
and
talk
to
Elinor
,
*NL*
who
often
derived
more
satisfaction
from
conversing
with
him
than
from
*NL*
any
other
daily
occurrence
,
but
who
saw
at
the
same
time
with
much
*NL*
concern
his
continued
regard
for
her
sister
.
She
feared
it
was
a
*NL*
strengthening
regard
.
It
grieved
her
to
see
the
earnestness
with
which
*NL*
he
often
watched
Marianne
,
and
his
spirits
were
certainly
worse
than
*NL*
when
at
Barton
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
week
after
their
arrival
,
it
became
certain
that
Willoughby
was
*NL*
also
arrived
.
His
card
was
on
the
table
when
they
came
in
from
the
*NL*
morning
's
drive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
cried
Marianne
,
``
he
has
been
here
while
we
were
out
.
''
*NL*
Elinor
,
rejoiced
to
be
assured
of
his
being
in
London
,
now
ventured
to
*NL*
say
,
``
Depend
upon
it
,
he
will
call
again
tomorrow
.
''
But
Marianne
*NL*
seemed
hardly
to
hear
her
,
and
on
Mrs.
Jennings
's
entrance
,
escaped
with
*NL*
the
precious
card
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
event
,
while
it
raised
the
spirits
of
Elinor
,
restored
to
those
of
*NL*
her
sister
all
,
and
more
than
all
,
their
former
agitation
.
From
this
*NL*
moment
her
mind
was
never
quiet
;
the
expectation
of
seeing
him
every
*NL*
hour
of
the
day
,
made
her
unfit
for
any
thing
.
She
insisted
on
being
*NL*
left
behind
,
the
next
morning
,
when
the
others
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
thoughts
were
full
of
what
might
be
passing
in
Berkeley
Street
*NL*
during
their
absence
;
but
a
moment
's
glance
at
her
sister
when
they
*NL*
returned
was
enough
to
inform
her
,
that
Willoughby
had
paid
no
second
*NL*
visit
there
.
A
note
was
just
then
brought
in
,
and
laid
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
!
''
cried
Marianne
,
stepping
hastily
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
,
for
my
mistress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Marianne
,
not
convinced
,
took
it
instantly
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
indeed
for
Mrs.
Jennings
;
how
provoking
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
expecting
a
letter
,
then
?
''
said
Elinor
,
unable
to
be
longer
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
little
--
not
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
pause
.
``
You
have
no
confidence
in
me
,
Marianne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Elinor
,
this
reproach
from
YOU
--
you
who
have
confidence
in
no
*NL*
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
''
returned
Elinor
in
some
confusion
;
``
indeed
,
Marianne
,
I
have
*NL*
nothing
to
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
,
''
answered
Marianne
with
energy
,
``
our
situations
then
are
alike
.
*NL*
We
have
neither
of
us
any
thing
to
tell
;
you
,
because
you
do
not
*NL*
communicate
,
and
I
,
because
I
conceal
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
distressed
by
this
charge
of
reserve
in
herself
,
which
she
was
*NL*
not
at
liberty
to
do
away
,
knew
not
how
,
under
such
circumstances
,
to
*NL*
press
for
greater
openness
in
Marianne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
soon
appeared
,
and
the
note
being
given
her
,
she
read
it
*NL*
aloud
.
It
was
from
Lady
Middleton
,
announcing
their
arrival
in
Conduit
*NL*
Street
the
night
before
,
and
requesting
the
company
of
her
mother
and
*NL*
cousins
the
following
evening
.
Business
on
Sir
John
's
part
,
and
a
*NL*
violent
cold
on
her
own
,
prevented
their
calling
in
Berkeley
Street
.
*NL*
The
invitation
was
accepted
;
but
when
the
hour
of
appointment
drew
*NL*
near
,
necessary
as
it
was
in
common
civility
to
Mrs.
Jennings
,
that
*NL*
they
should
both
attend
her
on
such
a
visit
,
Elinor
had
some
difficulty
*NL*
in
persuading
her
sister
to
go
,
for
still
she
had
seen
nothing
of
*NL*
Willoughby
;
and
therefore
was
not
more
indisposed
for
amusement
abroad
,
*NL*
than
unwilling
to
run
the
risk
of
his
calling
again
in
her
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
found
,
when
the
evening
was
over
,
that
disposition
is
not
*NL*
materially
altered
by
a
change
of
abode
,
for
although
scarcely
settled
*NL*
in
town
,
Sir
John
had
contrived
to
collect
around
him
,
nearly
twenty
*NL*
young
people
,
and
to
amuse
them
with
a
ball
.
This
was
an
affair
,
*NL*
however
,
of
which
Lady
Middleton
did
not
approve
.
In
the
country
,
an
*NL*
unpremeditated
dance
was
very
allowable
;
but
in
London
,
where
the
*NL*
reputation
of
elegance
was
more
important
and
less
easily
attained
,
it
*NL*
was
risking
too
much
for
the
gratification
of
a
few
girls
,
to
have
it
*NL*
known
that
Lady
Middleton
had
given
a
small
dance
of
eight
or
nine
*NL*
couple
,
with
two
violins
,
and
a
mere
side-board
collation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Palmer
were
of
the
party
;
from
the
former
,
whom
they
had
*NL*
not
seen
before
since
their
arrival
in
town
,
as
he
was
careful
to
avoid
*NL*
the
appearance
of
any
attention
to
his
mother-in-law
,
and
therefore
*NL*
never
came
near
her
,
they
received
no
mark
of
recognition
on
their
*NL*
entrance
.
He
looked
at
them
slightly
,
without
seeming
to
know
who
they
*NL*
were
,
and
merely
nodded
to
Mrs.
Jennings
from
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
room
.
Marianne
gave
one
glance
round
the
apartment
as
she
entered
:
it
*NL*
was
enough
--
HE
was
not
there
--
and
she
sat
down
,
equally
ill-disposed
to
*NL*
receive
or
communicate
pleasure
.
After
they
had
been
assembled
about
*NL*
an
hour
,
Mr.
Palmer
sauntered
towards
the
Miss
Dashwoods
to
express
his
*NL*
surprise
on
seeing
them
in
town
,
though
Colonel
Brandon
had
been
first
*NL*
informed
of
their
arrival
at
his
house
,
and
he
had
himself
said
*NL*
something
very
droll
on
hearing
that
they
were
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
both
in
Devonshire
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
?
''
replied
Elinor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
you
go
back
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
.
''
And
thus
ended
their
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
Marianne
been
so
unwilling
to
dance
in
her
life
,
as
she
was
*NL*
that
evening
,
and
never
so
much
fatigued
by
the
exercise
.
She
*NL*
complained
of
it
as
they
returned
to
Berkeley
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jennings
,
``
we
know
the
reason
of
all
that
very
*NL*
well
;
if
a
certain
person
who
shall
be
nameless
,
had
been
there
,
you
*NL*
would
not
have
been
a
bit
tired
:
and
to
say
the
truth
it
was
not
very
*NL*
pretty
of
him
not
to
give
you
the
meeting
when
he
was
invited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Invited
!
''
cried
Marianne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
my
daughter
Middleton
told
me
,
for
it
seems
Sir
John
met
him
*NL*
somewhere
in
the
street
this
morning
.
''
Marianne
said
no
more
,
but
*NL*
looked
exceedingly
hurt
.
Impatient
in
this
situation
to
be
doing
*NL*
something
that
might
lead
to
her
sister
's
relief
,
Elinor
resolved
to
*NL*
write
the
next
morning
to
her
mother
,
and
hoped
by
awakening
her
fears
*NL*
for
the
health
of
Marianne
,
to
procure
those
inquiries
which
had
been
*NL*
so
long
delayed
;
and
she
was
still
more
eagerly
bent
on
this
measure
by
*NL*
perceiving
after
breakfast
on
the
morrow
,
that
Marianne
was
again
*NL*
writing
to
Willoughby
,
for
she
could
not
suppose
it
to
be
to
any
other
*NL*
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
middle
of
the
day
,
Mrs.
Jennings
went
out
by
herself
on
*NL*
business
,
and
Elinor
began
her
letter
directly
,
while
Marianne
,
too
*NL*
restless
for
employment
,
too
anxious
for
conversation
,
walked
from
one
*NL*
window
to
the
other
,
or
sat
down
by
the
fire
in
melancholy
meditation
.
*NL*
Elinor
was
very
earnest
in
her
application
to
her
mother
,
relating
all
*NL*
that
had
passed
,
her
suspicions
of
Willoughby
's
inconstancy
,
urging
her
*NL*
by
every
plea
of
duty
and
affection
to
demand
from
Marianne
an
account
*NL*
of
her
real
situation
with
respect
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
letter
was
scarcely
finished
,
when
a
rap
foretold
a
visitor
,
and
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
was
announced
.
Marianne
,
who
had
seen
him
from
the
*NL*
window
,
and
who
hated
company
of
any
kind
,
left
the
room
before
he
*NL*
entered
it
.
He
looked
more
than
usually
grave
,
and
though
expressing
*NL*
satisfaction
at
finding
Miss
Dashwood
alone
,
as
if
he
had
somewhat
in
*NL*
particular
to
tell
her
,
sat
for
some
time
without
saying
a
word
.
*NL*
Elinor
,
persuaded
that
he
had
some
communication
to
make
in
which
her
*NL*
sister
was
concerned
,
impatiently
expected
its
opening
.
It
was
not
the
*NL*
first
time
of
her
feeling
the
same
kind
of
conviction
;
for
,
more
than
*NL*
once
before
,
beginning
with
the
observation
of
``
your
sister
looks
*NL*
unwell
to-day
,
''
or
``
your
sister
seems
out
of
spirits
,
''
he
had
appeared
*NL*
on
the
point
,
either
of
disclosing
,
or
of
inquiring
,
something
*NL*
particular
about
her
.
After
a
pause
of
several
minutes
,
their
silence
*NL*
was
broken
,
by
his
asking
her
in
a
voice
of
some
agitation
,
when
he
was
*NL*
to
congratulate
her
on
the
acquisition
of
a
brother
?
Elinor
was
not
*NL*
prepared
for
such
a
question
,
and
having
no
answer
ready
,
was
obliged
*NL*
to
adopt
the
simple
and
common
expedient
,
of
asking
what
he
meant
?
He
*NL*
tried
to
smile
as
he
replied
,
``
your
sister
's
engagement
to
Mr.
*NL*
Willoughby
is
very
generally
known
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be
generally
known
,
''
returned
Elinor
,
``
for
her
own
family
do
*NL*
not
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
surprised
and
said
,
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
I
am
afraid
my
*NL*
inquiry
has
been
impertinent
;
but
I
had
not
supposed
any
secrecy
*NL*
intended
,
as
they
openly
correspond
,
and
their
marriage
is
universally
*NL*
talked
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
that
be
?
By
whom
can
you
have
heard
it
mentioned
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
many
--
by
some
of
whom
you
know
nothing
,
by
others
with
whom
you
are
*NL*
most
intimate
,
Mrs.
Jennings
,
Mrs.
Palmer
,
and
the
Middletons
.
But
*NL*
still
I
might
not
have
believed
it
,
for
where
the
mind
is
perhaps
*NL*
rather
unwilling
to
be
convinced
,
it
will
always
find
something
to
*NL*
support
its
doubts
,
if
I
had
not
,
when
the
servant
let
me
in
today
,
*NL*
accidentally
seen
a
letter
in
his
hand
,
directed
to
Mr.
Willoughby
in
*NL*
your
sister
's
writing
.
I
came
to
inquire
,
but
I
was
convinced
before
I
*NL*
could
ask
the
question
.
Is
every
thing
finally
settled
?
Is
it
*NL*
impossible
to
-
?
But
I
have
no
right
,
and
I
could
have
no
chance
of
*NL*
succeeding
.
Excuse
me
,
Miss
Dashwood
.
I
believe
I
have
been
wrong
in
*NL*
saying
so
much
,
but
I
hardly
know
what
to
do
,
and
on
your
prudence
I
*NL*
have
the
strongest
dependence
.
Tell
me
that
it
is
all
absolutely
*NL*
resolved
on
,
that
any
attempt
,
that
in
short
concealment
,
if
*NL*
concealment
be
possible
,
is
all
that
remains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
,
which
conveyed
to
Elinor
a
direct
avowal
of
his
love
for
*NL*
her
sister
,
affected
her
very
much
.
She
was
not
immediately
able
to
*NL*
say
anything
,
and
even
when
her
spirits
were
recovered
,
she
debated
for
*NL*
a
short
time
,
on
the
answer
it
would
be
most
proper
to
give
.
The
real
*NL*
state
of
things
between
Willoughby
and
her
sister
was
so
little
known
*NL*
to
herself
,
that
in
endeavouring
to
explain
it
,
she
might
be
as
liable
*NL*
to
say
too
much
as
too
little
.
Yet
as
she
was
convinced
that
*NL*
Marianne
's
affection
for
Willoughby
,
could
leave
no
hope
of
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
's
success
,
whatever
the
event
of
that
affection
might
be
,
and
*NL*
at
the
same
time
wished
to
shield
her
conduct
from
censure
,
she
thought
*NL*
it
most
prudent
and
kind
,
after
some
consideration
,
to
say
more
than
*NL*
she
really
knew
or
believed
.
She
acknowledged
,
therefore
,
that
though
*NL*
she
had
never
been
informed
by
themselves
of
the
terms
on
which
they
*NL*
stood
with
each
other
,
of
their
mutual
affection
she
had
no
doubt
,
and
*NL*
of
their
correspondence
she
was
not
astonished
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
to
her
with
silent
attention
,
and
on
her
ceasing
to
speak
,
*NL*
rose
directly
from
his
seat
,
and
after
saying
in
a
voice
of
emotion
,
*NL*
``
to
your
sister
I
wish
all
imaginable
happiness
;
to
Willoughby
that
he
*NL*
may
endeavour
to
deserve
her
,
''
--
took
leave
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
derived
no
comfortable
feelings
from
this
conversation
,
to
*NL*
lessen
the
uneasiness
of
her
mind
on
other
points
;
she
was
left
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
with
a
melancholy
impression
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
*NL*
unhappiness
,
and
was
prevented
even
from
wishing
it
removed
,
by
her
*NL*
anxiety
for
the
very
event
that
must
confirm
it
.

CHAPTER
28
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
occurred
during
the
next
three
or
four
days
,
to
make
Elinor
*NL*
regret
what
she
had
done
,
in
applying
to
her
mother
;
for
Willoughby
*NL*
neither
came
nor
wrote
.
They
were
engaged
about
the
end
of
that
time
*NL*
to
attend
Lady
Middleton
to
a
party
,
from
which
Mrs.
Jennings
was
kept
*NL*
away
by
the
indisposition
of
her
youngest
daughter
;
and
for
this
party
,
*NL*
Marianne
,
wholly
dispirited
,
careless
of
her
appearance
,
and
seeming
*NL*
equally
indifferent
whether
she
went
or
staid
,
prepared
,
without
one
*NL*
look
of
hope
or
one
expression
of
pleasure
.
She
sat
by
the
*NL*
drawing-room
fire
after
tea
,
till
the
moment
of
Lady
Middleton
's
*NL*
arrival
,
without
once
stirring
from
her
seat
,
or
altering
her
attitude
,
*NL*
lost
in
her
own
thoughts
,
and
insensible
of
her
sister
's
presence
;
and
*NL*
when
at
last
they
were
told
that
Lady
Middleton
waited
for
them
at
the
*NL*
door
,
she
started
as
if
she
had
forgotten
that
any
one
was
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
arrived
in
due
time
at
the
place
of
destination
,
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
string
of
carriages
before
them
would
allow
,
alighted
,
ascended
the
*NL*
stairs
,
heard
their
names
announced
from
one
landing-place
to
another
*NL*
in
an
audible
voice
,
and
entered
a
room
splendidly
lit
up
,
quite
full
*NL*
of
company
,
and
insufferably
hot
.
When
they
had
paid
their
tribute
of
*NL*
politeness
by
curtsying
to
the
lady
of
the
house
,
they
were
permitted
*NL*
to
mingle
in
the
crowd
,
and
take
their
share
of
the
heat
and
*NL*
inconvenience
,
to
which
their
arrival
must
necessarily
add
.
After
some
*NL*
time
spent
in
saying
little
or
doing
less
,
Lady
Middleton
sat
down
to
*NL*
Cassino
,
and
as
Marianne
was
not
in
spirits
for
moving
about
,
she
and
*NL*
Elinor
luckily
succeeding
to
chairs
,
placed
themselves
at
no
great
*NL*
distance
from
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
remained
in
this
manner
long
,
before
Elinor
perceived
*NL*
Willoughby
,
standing
within
a
few
yards
of
them
,
in
earnest
*NL*
conversation
with
a
very
fashionable
looking
young
woman
.
She
soon
*NL*
caught
his
eye
,
and
he
immediately
bowed
,
but
without
attempting
to
*NL*
speak
to
her
,
or
to
approach
Marianne
,
though
he
could
not
but
see
her
;
*NL*
and
then
continued
his
discourse
with
the
same
lady
.
Elinor
turned
*NL*
involuntarily
to
Marianne
,
to
see
whether
it
could
be
unobserved
by
*NL*
her
.
At
that
moment
she
first
perceived
him
,
and
her
whole
countenance
*NL*
glowing
with
sudden
delight
,
she
would
have
moved
towards
him
*NL*
instantly
,
had
not
her
sister
caught
hold
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
he
is
there
--
he
is
there
--
Oh
!
why
does
*NL*
he
not
look
at
me
?
why
can
not
I
speak
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
pray
be
composed
,
''
cried
Elinor
,
``
and
do
not
betray
what
you
*NL*
feel
to
every
body
present
.
Perhaps
he
has
not
observed
you
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
however
was
more
than
she
could
believe
herself
;
and
to
be
*NL*
composed
at
such
a
moment
was
not
only
beyond
the
reach
of
Marianne
,
it
*NL*
was
beyond
her
wish
.
She
sat
in
an
agony
of
impatience
which
affected
*NL*
every
feature
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
turned
round
again
,
and
regarded
them
both
;
she
started
up
,
*NL*
and
pronouncing
his
name
in
a
tone
of
affection
,
held
out
her
hand
to
*NL*
him
.
He
approached
,
and
addressing
himself
rather
to
Elinor
than
*NL*
Marianne
,
as
if
wishing
to
avoid
her
eye
,
and
determined
not
to
observe
*NL*
her
attitude
,
inquired
in
a
hurried
manner
after
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
and
*NL*
asked
how
long
they
had
been
in
town
.
Elinor
was
robbed
of
all
*NL*
presence
of
mind
by
such
an
address
,
and
was
unable
to
say
a
word
.
But
*NL*
the
feelings
of
her
sister
were
instantly
expressed
.
Her
face
was
*NL*
crimsoned
over
,
and
she
exclaimed
,
in
a
voice
of
the
greatest
emotion
,
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
Willoughby
,
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
Have
you
not
*NL*
received
my
letters
?
Will
you
not
shake
hands
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
then
avoid
it
,
but
her
touch
seemed
painful
to
him
,
and
he
*NL*
held
her
hand
only
for
a
moment
.
During
all
this
time
he
was
evidently
*NL*
struggling
for
composure
.
Elinor
watched
his
countenance
and
saw
its
*NL*
expression
becoming
more
tranquil
.
After
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
spoke
*NL*
with
calmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
myself
the
honour
of
calling
in
Berkeley
Street
last
Tuesday
,
*NL*
and
very
much
regretted
that
I
was
not
fortunate
enough
to
find
*NL*
yourselves
and
Mrs.
Jennings
at
home
.
My
card
was
not
lost
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
have
you
not
received
my
notes
?
''
cried
Marianne
in
the
wildest
*NL*
anxiety
.
``
Here
is
some
mistake
I
am
sure
--
some
dreadful
mistake
.
What
*NL*
can
be
the
meaning
of
it
?
Tell
me
,
Willoughby
;
for
heaven
's
sake
tell
*NL*
me
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
reply
;
his
complexion
changed
and
all
his
embarrassment
*NL*
returned
;
but
as
if
,
on
catching
the
eye
of
the
young
lady
with
whom
he
*NL*
had
been
previously
talking
,
he
felt
the
necessity
of
instant
exertion
,
*NL*
he
recovered
himself
again
,
and
after
saying
,
``
Yes
,
I
had
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
receiving
the
information
of
your
arrival
in
town
,
which
you
were
so
*NL*
good
as
to
send
me
,
''
turned
hastily
away
with
a
slight
bow
and
joined
*NL*
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
,
now
looking
dreadfully
white
,
and
unable
to
stand
,
sunk
into
*NL*
her
chair
,
and
Elinor
,
expecting
every
moment
to
see
her
faint
,
tried
*NL*
to
screen
her
from
the
observation
of
others
,
while
reviving
her
with
*NL*
lavender
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
him
,
Elinor
,
''
she
cried
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
,
``
and
force
*NL*
him
to
come
to
me
.
Tell
him
I
must
see
him
again
--
must
speak
to
him
*NL*
instantly
.
--
I
can
not
rest
--
I
shall
not
have
a
moment
's
peace
till
this
*NL*
is
explained
--
some
dreadful
misapprehension
or
other
.
--
Oh
go
to
him
*NL*
this
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
that
be
done
?
No
,
my
dearest
Marianne
,
you
must
wait
.
This
is
*NL*
not
the
place
for
explanations
.
Wait
only
till
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
difficulty
however
could
she
prevent
her
from
following
him
*NL*
herself
;
and
to
persuade
her
to
check
her
agitation
,
to
wait
,
at
least
,
*NL*
with
the
appearance
of
composure
,
till
she
might
speak
to
him
with
more
*NL*
privacy
and
more
effect
,
was
impossible
;
for
Marianne
continued
*NL*
incessantly
to
give
way
in
a
low
voice
to
the
misery
of
her
feelings
,
*NL*
by
exclamations
of
wretchedness
.
In
a
short
time
Elinor
saw
Willoughby
*NL*
quit
the
room
by
the
door
towards
the
staircase
,
and
telling
Marianne
*NL*
that
he
was
gone
,
urged
the
impossibility
of
speaking
to
him
again
that
*NL*
evening
,
as
a
fresh
argument
for
her
to
be
calm
.
She
instantly
begged
*NL*
her
sister
would
entreat
Lady
Middleton
to
take
them
home
,
as
she
was
*NL*
too
miserable
to
stay
a
minute
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Middleton
,
though
in
the
middle
of
a
rubber
,
on
being
informed
*NL*
that
Marianne
was
unwell
,
was
too
polite
to
object
for
a
moment
to
her
*NL*
wish
of
going
away
,
and
making
over
her
cards
to
a
friend
,
they
*NL*
departed
as
soon
the
carriage
could
be
found
.
Scarcely
a
word
was
*NL*
spoken
during
their
return
to
Berkeley
Street
.
Marianne
was
in
a
*NL*
silent
agony
,
too
much
oppressed
even
for
tears
;
but
as
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
was
luckily
not
come
home
,
they
could
go
directly
to
their
own
room
,
*NL*
where
hartshorn
restored
her
a
little
to
herself
.
She
was
soon
*NL*
undressed
and
in
bed
,
and
as
she
seemed
desirous
of
being
alone
,
her
*NL*
sister
then
left
her
,
and
while
she
waited
the
return
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
*NL*
had
leisure
enough
for
thinking
over
the
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
some
kind
of
engagement
had
subsisted
between
Willoughby
and
*NL*
Marianne
she
could
not
doubt
,
and
that
Willoughby
was
weary
of
it
,
*NL*
seemed
equally
clear
;
for
however
Marianne
might
still
feed
her
own
*NL*
wishes
,
SHE
could
not
attribute
such
behaviour
to
mistake
or
*NL*
misapprehension
of
any
kind
.
Nothing
but
a
thorough
change
of
*NL*
sentiment
could
account
for
it
.
Her
indignation
would
have
been
still
*NL*
stronger
than
it
was
,
had
she
not
witnessed
that
embarrassment
which
*NL*
seemed
to
speak
a
consciousness
of
his
own
misconduct
,
and
prevented
*NL*
her
from
believing
him
so
unprincipled
as
to
have
been
sporting
with
*NL*
the
affections
of
her
sister
from
the
first
,
without
any
design
that
*NL*
would
bear
investigation
.
Absence
might
have
weakened
his
regard
,
and
*NL*
convenience
might
have
determined
him
to
overcome
it
,
but
that
such
a
*NL*
regard
had
formerly
existed
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Marianne
,
on
the
pangs
which
so
unhappy
a
meeting
must
already
*NL*
have
given
her
,
and
on
those
still
more
severe
which
might
await
her
in
*NL*
its
probable
consequence
,
she
could
not
reflect
without
the
deepest
*NL*
concern
.
Her
own
situation
gained
in
the
comparison
;
for
while
she
*NL*
could
ESTEEM
Edward
as
much
as
ever
,
however
they
might
be
divided
in
*NL*
future
,
her
mind
might
be
always
supported
.
But
every
circumstance
*NL*
that
could
embitter
such
an
evil
seemed
uniting
to
heighten
the
misery
*NL*
of
Marianne
in
a
final
separation
from
Willoughby
--
in
an
immediate
and
*NL*
irreconcilable
rupture
with
him
.

CHAPTER
29
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
house-maid
had
lit
their
fire
the
next
day
,
or
the
sun
*NL*
gained
any
power
over
a
cold
,
gloomy
morning
in
January
,
Marianne
,
only
*NL*
half
dressed
,
was
kneeling
against
one
of
the
window-seats
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
all
the
little
light
she
could
command
from
it
,
and
writing
as
fast
*NL*
as
a
continual
flow
of
tears
would
permit
her
.
In
this
situation
,
*NL*
Elinor
,
roused
from
sleep
by
her
agitation
and
sobs
,
first
perceived
*NL*
her
;
and
after
observing
her
for
a
few
moments
with
silent
anxiety
,
*NL*
said
,
in
a
tone
of
the
most
considerate
gentleness
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marianne
,
may
I
ask
-
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Elinor
,
''
she
replied
,
``
ask
nothing
;
you
will
soon
know
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sort
of
desperate
calmness
with
which
this
was
said
,
lasted
no
*NL*
longer
than
while
she
spoke
,
and
was
immediately
followed
by
a
return
*NL*
of
the
same
excessive
affliction
.
It
was
some
minutes
before
she
could
*NL*
go
on
with
her
letter
,
and
the
frequent
bursts
of
grief
which
still
*NL*
obliged
her
,
at
intervals
,
to
withhold
her
pen
,
were
proofs
enough
of
*NL*
her
feeling
how
more
than
probable
it
was
that
she
was
writing
for
the
*NL*
last
time
to
Willoughby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
paid
her
every
quiet
and
unobtrusive
attention
in
her
power
;
and
*NL*
she
would
have
tried
to
sooth
and
tranquilize
her
still
more
,
had
not
*NL*
Marianne
entreated
her
,
with
all
the
eagerness
of
the
most
nervous
*NL*
irritability
,
not
to
speak
to
her
for
the
world
.
In
such
*NL*
circumstances
,
it
was
better
for
both
that
they
should
not
be
long
*NL*
together
;
and
the
restless
state
of
Marianne
's
mind
not
only
prevented
*NL*
her
from
remaining
in
the
room
a
moment
after
she
was
dressed
,
but
*NL*
requiring
at
once
solitude
and
continual
change
of
place
,
made
her
*NL*
wander
about
the
house
till
breakfast
time
,
avoiding
the
sight
of
every
*NL*
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
breakfast
she
neither
ate
,
nor
attempted
to
eat
any
thing
;
and
*NL*
Elinor
's
attention
was
then
all
employed
,
not
in
urging
her
,
not
in
*NL*
pitying
her
,
nor
in
appearing
to
regard
her
,
but
in
endeavouring
to
*NL*
engage
Mrs.
Jennings
's
notice
entirely
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
was
a
favourite
meal
with
Mrs.
Jennings
,
it
lasted
a
*NL*
considerable
time
,
and
they
were
just
setting
themselves
,
after
it
,
*NL*
round
the
common
working
table
,
when
a
letter
was
delivered
to
*NL*
Marianne
,
which
she
eagerly
caught
from
the
servant
,
and
,
turning
of
a
*NL*
death-like
paleness
,
instantly
ran
out
of
the
room
.
Elinor
,
who
saw
as
*NL*
plainly
by
this
,
as
if
she
had
seen
the
direction
,
that
it
must
come
*NL*
from
Willoughby
,
felt
immediately
such
a
sickness
at
heart
as
made
her
*NL*
hardly
able
to
hold
up
her
head
,
and
sat
in
such
a
general
tremour
as
*NL*
made
her
fear
it
impossible
to
escape
Mrs.
Jennings
's
notice
.
That
good
*NL*
lady
,
however
,
saw
only
that
Marianne
had
received
a
letter
from
*NL*
Willoughby
,
which
appeared
to
her
a
very
good
joke
,
and
which
she
*NL*
treated
accordingly
,
by
hoping
,
with
a
laugh
,
that
she
would
find
it
to
*NL*
her
liking
.
Of
Elinor
's
distress
,
she
was
too
busily
employed
in
*NL*
measuring
lengths
of
worsted
for
her
rug
,
to
see
any
thing
at
all
;
and
*NL*
calmly
continuing
her
talk
,
as
soon
as
Marianne
disappeared
,
she
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
I
never
saw
a
young
woman
so
desperately
in
love
in
my
*NL*
life
!
MY
girls
were
nothing
to
her
,
and
yet
they
used
to
be
foolish
*NL*
enough
;
but
as
for
Miss
Marianne
,
she
is
quite
an
altered
creature
.
I
*NL*
hope
,
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
,
he
wo
n't
keep
her
waiting
much
*NL*
longer
,
for
it
is
quite
grievous
to
see
her
look
so
ill
and
forlorn
.
*NL*
Pray
,
when
are
they
to
be
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
though
never
less
disposed
to
speak
than
at
that
moment
,
*NL*
obliged
herself
to
answer
such
an
attack
as
this
,
and
,
therefore
,
*NL*
trying
to
smile
,
replied
,
``
And
have
you
really
,
Ma'am
,
talked
yourself
*NL*
into
a
persuasion
of
my
sister
's
being
engaged
to
Mr.
Willoughby
?
I
*NL*
thought
it
had
been
only
a
joke
,
but
so
serious
a
question
seems
to
*NL*
imply
more
;
and
I
must
beg
,
therefore
,
that
you
will
not
deceive
*NL*
yourself
any
longer
.
I
do
assure
you
that
nothing
would
surprise
me
*NL*
more
than
to
hear
of
their
being
going
to
be
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
shame
,
for
shame
,
Miss
Dashwood
!
how
can
you
talk
so
?
Do
n't
we
*NL*
all
know
that
it
must
be
a
match
,
that
they
were
over
head
and
ears
in
*NL*
love
with
each
other
from
the
first
moment
they
met
?
Did
not
I
see
*NL*
them
together
in
Devonshire
every
day
,
and
all
day
long
;
and
did
not
I
*NL*
know
that
your
sister
came
to
town
with
me
on
purpose
to
buy
wedding
*NL*
clothes
?
Come
,
come
,
this
wo
n't
do
.
Because
you
are
so
sly
about
it
*NL*
yourself
,
you
think
nobody
else
has
any
senses
;
but
it
is
no
such
*NL*
thing
,
I
can
tell
you
,
for
it
has
been
known
all
over
town
this
ever
so
*NL*
long
.
I
tell
every
body
of
it
and
so
does
Charlotte
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Ma'am
,
''
said
Elinor
,
very
seriously
,
``
you
are
mistaken
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
you
are
doing
a
very
unkind
thing
in
spreading
the
report
,
and
*NL*
you
will
find
that
you
have
though
you
will
not
believe
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
laughed
again
,
but
Elinor
had
not
spirits
to
say
more
,
*NL*
and
eager
at
all
events
to
know
what
Willoughby
had
written
,
hurried
*NL*
away
to
their
room
,
where
,
on
opening
the
door
,
she
saw
Marianne
*NL*
stretched
on
the
bed
,
almost
choked
by
grief
,
one
letter
in
her
hand
,
*NL*
and
two
or
three
others
laying
by
her
.
Elinor
drew
near
,
but
without
*NL*
saying
a
word
;
and
seating
herself
on
the
bed
,
took
her
hand
,
kissed
*NL*
her
affectionately
several
times
,
and
then
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
*NL*
tears
,
which
at
first
was
scarcely
less
violent
than
Marianne
's
.
The
*NL*
latter
,
though
unable
to
speak
,
seemed
to
feel
all
the
tenderness
of
*NL*
this
behaviour
,
and
after
some
time
thus
spent
in
joint
affliction
,
she
*NL*
put
all
the
letters
into
Elinor
's
hands
;
and
then
covering
her
face
*NL*
with
her
handkerchief
,
almost
screamed
with
agony
.
Elinor
,
who
knew
*NL*
that
such
grief
,
shocking
as
it
was
to
witness
it
,
must
have
its
*NL*
course
,
watched
by
her
till
this
excess
of
suffering
had
somewhat
spent
*NL*
itself
,
and
then
turning
eagerly
to
Willoughby
's
letter
,
read
as
*NL*
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bond
Street
,
January
.
*NL*
``
MY
DEAR
MADAM
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
had
the
honour
of
receiving
your
*NL*
letter
,
for
which
I
beg
to
return
my
sincere
*NL*
acknowledgments
.
I
am
much
concerned
to
find
there
*NL*
was
anything
in
my
behaviour
last
night
that
did
*NL*
not
meet
your
approbation
;
and
though
I
am
quite
at
*NL*
a
loss
to
discover
in
what
point
I
could
be
so
*NL*
unfortunate
as
to
offend
you
,
I
entreat
your
*NL*
forgiveness
of
what
I
can
assure
you
to
have
been
*NL*
perfectly
unintentional
.
I
shall
never
reflect
on
*NL*
my
former
acquaintance
with
your
family
in
Devonshire
*NL*
without
the
most
grateful
pleasure
,
and
flatter
*NL*
myself
it
will
not
be
broken
by
any
mistake
or
*NL*
misapprehension
of
my
actions
.
My
esteem
for
your
*NL*
whole
family
is
very
sincere
;
but
if
I
have
been
so
*NL*
unfortunate
as
to
give
rise
to
a
belief
of
more
than
*NL*
I
felt
,
or
meant
to
express
,
I
shall
reproach
myself
*NL*
for
not
having
been
more
guarded
in
my
professions
*NL*
of
that
esteem
.
That
I
should
ever
have
meant
more
*NL*
you
will
allow
to
be
impossible
,
when
you
understand
*NL*
that
my
affections
have
been
long
engaged
elsewhere
,
*NL*
and
it
will
not
be
many
weeks
,
I
believe
,
before
*NL*
this
engagement
is
fulfilled
.
It
is
with
great
*NL*
regret
that
I
obey
your
commands
in
returning
the
*NL*
letters
with
which
I
have
been
honoured
from
you
,
*NL*
and
the
lock
of
hair
,
which
you
so
obligingly
bestowed
*NL*
on
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
dear
Madam

*NL*
``
Your
most
obedient
*NL*
``
humble
servant

JOHN
WILLOUGHBY

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
what
indignation
such
a
letter
as
this
must
be
read
by
Miss
*NL*
Dashwood
,
may
be
imagined
.
Though
aware
,
before
she
began
it
,
that
it
*NL*
must
bring
a
confession
of
his
inconstancy
,
and
confirm
their
*NL*
separation
for
ever
,
she
was
not
aware
that
such
language
could
be
*NL*
suffered
to
announce
it
;
nor
could
she
have
supposed
Willoughby
capable
*NL*
of
departing
so
far
from
the
appearance
of
every
honourable
and
*NL*
delicate
feeling
--
so
far
from
the
common
decorum
of
a
gentleman
,
as
to
*NL*
send
a
letter
so
impudently
cruel
:
a
letter
which
,
instead
of
bringing
*NL*
with
his
desire
of
a
release
any
professions
of
regret
,
acknowledged
no
*NL*
breach
of
faith
,
denied
all
peculiar
affection
whatever
--
a
letter
of
*NL*
which
every
line
was
an
insult
,
and
which
proclaimed
its
writer
to
be
*NL*
deep
in
hardened
villainy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
over
it
for
some
time
with
indignant
astonishment
;
then
read
*NL*
it
again
and
again
;
but
every
perusal
only
served
to
increase
her
*NL*
abhorrence
of
the
man
,
and
so
bitter
were
her
feelings
against
him
,
*NL*
that
she
dared
not
trust
herself
to
speak
,
lest
she
might
wound
*NL*
Marianne
still
deeper
by
treating
their
disengagement
,
not
as
a
loss
to
*NL*
her
of
any
possible
good
but
as
an
escape
from
the
worst
and
most
*NL*
irremediable
of
all
evils
,
a
connection
,
for
life
,
with
an
unprincipled
*NL*
man
,
as
a
deliverance
the
most
real
,
a
blessing
the
most
important
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
earnest
meditations
on
the
contents
of
the
letter
,
on
the
*NL*
depravity
of
that
mind
which
could
dictate
it
,
and
probably
,
on
the
*NL*
very
different
mind
of
a
very
different
person
,
who
had
no
other
*NL*
connection
whatever
with
the
affair
than
what
her
heart
gave
him
with
*NL*
every
thing
that
passed
,
Elinor
forgot
the
immediate
distress
of
her
*NL*
sister
,
forgot
that
she
had
three
letters
on
her
lap
yet
unread
,
and
so
*NL*
entirely
forgot
how
long
she
had
been
in
the
room
,
that
when
on
hearing
*NL*
a
carriage
drive
up
to
the
door
,
she
went
to
the
window
to
see
who
*NL*
could
be
coming
so
unreasonably
early
,
she
was
all
astonishment
to
*NL*
perceive
Mrs.
Jennings
's
chariot
,
which
she
knew
had
not
been
ordered
*NL*
till
one
.
Determined
not
to
quit
Marianne
,
though
hopeless
of
*NL*
contributing
,
at
present
,
to
her
ease
,
she
hurried
away
to
excuse
*NL*
herself
from
attending
Mrs.
Jennings
,
on
account
of
her
sister
being
*NL*
indisposed
.
Mrs.
Jennings
,
with
a
thoroughly
good-humoured
concern
for
*NL*
its
cause
,
admitted
the
excuse
most
readily
,
and
Elinor
,
after
seeing
*NL*
her
safe
off
,
returned
to
Marianne
,
whom
she
found
attempting
to
rise
*NL*
from
the
bed
,
and
whom
she
reached
just
in
time
to
prevent
her
from
*NL*
falling
on
the
floor
,
faint
and
giddy
from
a
long
want
of
proper
rest
*NL*
and
food
;
for
it
was
many
days
since
she
had
any
appetite
,
and
many
*NL*
nights
since
she
had
really
slept
;
and
now
,
when
her
mind
was
no
longer
*NL*
supported
by
the
fever
of
suspense
,
the
consequence
of
all
this
was
*NL*
felt
in
an
aching
head
,
a
weakened
stomach
,
and
a
general
nervous
*NL*
faintness
.
A
glass
of
wine
,
which
Elinor
procured
for
her
directly
,
*NL*
made
her
more
comfortable
,
and
she
was
at
last
able
to
express
some
*NL*
sense
of
her
kindness
,
by
saying
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Elinor
!
how
unhappy
I
make
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
wish
,
''
replied
her
sister
,
``
there
were
any
thing
I
COULD
do
,
*NL*
which
might
be
of
comfort
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
as
every
thing
else
would
have
been
,
was
too
much
for
Marianne
,
*NL*
who
could
only
exclaim
,
in
the
anguish
of
her
heart
,
``
Oh
!
Elinor
,
I
am
*NL*
miserable
,
indeed
,
''
before
her
voice
was
entirely
lost
in
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
no
longer
witness
this
torrent
of
unresisted
grief
in
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exert
yourself
,
dear
Marianne
,
''
she
cried
,
``
if
you
would
not
kill
*NL*
yourself
and
all
who
love
you
.
Think
of
your
mother
;
think
of
her
*NL*
misery
while
YOU
suffer

for
her
sake
you
must
exert
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Marianne
;

so

easy
for

no
sorrow
of
their
own
to
talk
of

exertion

*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive

throwing
her
arms
round
her

solemnly

*NL*
``

Marianne
wildly
,

Much

think
of
what
you

have
suffered

months

Elinor
said
no
more
,
and
turning
again
to
the
three
letters
which
now
*NL*
raised
a
much
stronger
curiosity
than
before
,
directly
ran
over
the
*NL*
contents
of
all
.
The
first
,
which
was
what
her
sister
had
sent
him
on
*NL*
their
arrival
in
town
,
was
to
this
effect
.

Berkeley
Street
,
January

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
surprised
you
will
be
,
Willoughby
,
on
*NL*
receiving
this
;
and
I
think
you
will
feel
something
*NL*
more
than
surprise
,
when
you
know
that
I
am
in
town
.
*NL*
An
opportunity
of
coming
hither
,
though
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
,
was
a
temptation
we
could
not
resist

*NL*
I
wish
you
may
receive
this
in
time
to
come
here

to-night

I
will
not

on
it

Her
second
note
,
which
had
been
written
on
the
morning
after
the
dance
*NL*
at
the
Middletons
'
,
was
in
these
words
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
express
my
disappointment
in
having
*NL*
missed
you
the
day
before
yesterday
,
nor
my
astonishment
*NL*
at
not
having
received
any
answer
to
a
note
which
*NL*
I
sent
you
above
a
week
ago
.
I
have
been
expecting
*NL*
to
hear
from
you
,
and
still
more
to
see
you
,
every
*NL*
hour
of
the
day
.
Pray
call
again
as
soon
as
possible
,
*NL*
and
explain
the
reason
of
my
having
expected
this
*NL*
in
vain
.
You
had
better
come
earlier
another
time
,
*NL*
because
we
are
generally
out
by
one
.
We
were
last
*NL*
night
at
Lady
Middleton
's
,
where
there
was
a
dance
.
*NL*
I
have
been
told
that
you
were
asked
to
be
of
the
*NL*
party
.
But
could
it
be
so
?
You
must
be
very
much
*NL*
altered
indeed
since
we
parted
,
if
that
could
be
*NL*
the
case
,
and
you
not
there
.
But
I
will
not
suppose
*NL*
this
possible
,
and
I
hope
very
soon
to
receive
your
*NL*
personal
assurance
of
its
being
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

The
contents
of
her
last
note
to
him
were
these
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
imagine
,
Willoughby
,
by
your
*NL*
behaviour
last
night
?
Again
I
demand
an
explanation
*NL*
of
it
.
I
was
prepared
to
meet
you
with
the
pleasure
*NL*
which
our
separation
naturally
produced
,
with
the
*NL*
familiarity
which
our
intimacy
at
Barton
appeared
*NL*
to
me
to
justify
.
I
was
repulsed
indeed
!
I
have
*NL*
passed
a
wretched
night
in
endeavouring
to
excuse
*NL*
a
conduct
which
can
scarcely
be
called
less
than
*NL*
insulting
;
but
though
I
have
not
yet
been
able
to
*NL*
form
any
reasonable
apology
for
your
behaviour
,
*NL*
I
am
perfectly
ready
to
hear
your
justification
of
*NL*
it
.
You
have
perhaps
been
misinformed
,
or
purposely
*NL*
deceived
,
in
something
concerning
me
,
which
may
have
*NL*
lowered
me
in
your
opinion
.
Tell
me
what
it
is
,
*NL*
explain
the
grounds
on
which
you
acted
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
be
satisfied
,
in
being
able
to
satisfy
you
.
It
*NL*
would
grieve
me
indeed
to
be
obliged
to
think
ill
*NL*
of
you
;
but
if
I
am
to
do
it
,
if
I
am
to
learn
that
*NL*
you
are
not
what
we
have
hitherto
believed
you
,
that
*NL*
your
regard
for
us
all
was
insincere
,
that
your
*NL*
behaviour
to
me
was
intended
only
to
deceive
,
let
*NL*
it
be
told
as
soon
as
possible
.
My
feelings
are
at
*NL*
present
in
a
state
of
dreadful
indecision
;
I
wish
*NL*
to
acquit
you
,
but
certainty
on
either
side
will
be
*NL*
ease
to
what
I
now
suffer
.
If
your
sentiments
are
*NL*
no
longer
what
they
were
,
you
will
return
my
notes
,
*NL*
and
the
lock
of
my
hair
which
is
in
your
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.D.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
such
letters
,
so
full
of
affection
and
confidence
,
could
have
been
*NL*
so
answered
,
Elinor
,
for
Willoughby
's
sake
,
would
have
been
unwilling
*NL*
to
believe
.
But
her
condemnation
of
him
did
not
blind
her
to
the
*NL*
impropriety
of
their
having
been
written
at
all
;
and
she
was
silently
*NL*
grieving
over
the
imprudence
which
had
hazarded
such
unsolicited
proofs
*NL*
of
tenderness
,
not
warranted
by
anything
preceding
,
and
most
severely
*NL*
condemned
by
the
event
,
when
Marianne
,
perceiving
that
she
had
finished
*NL*
the
letters
,
observed
to
her
that
they
contained
nothing
but
what
any
*NL*
one
would
have
written
in
the
same
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
myself
,
''
she
added
,
``
to
be
as
solemnly
engaged
to
him
,
as
if
*NL*
the
strictest
legal
covenant
had
bound
us
to
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
believe
it
,
''
said
Elinor
;
``
but
unfortunately
he
did
not
feel
the
*NL*
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
DID
feel
the
same
,
Elinor
--
for
weeks

weeks
he
felt
it

I
know
*NL*
he
did
.
Whatever
may
have
changed
him
now
,
-LRB-
and
nothing
but
the
*NL*
blackest
art
employed
against
me
can
have
done
it
-RRB-
,
I
was
once
as
dear
*NL*
to
him
as
my
own
soul
could
wish
.
This
lock
of
hair
,
which
now
he
can
*NL*
so
readily
give
up
,
was
begged
of
me
with
the
most
earnest
*NL*
supplication
.
Had
you
seen
his
look
,
his
manner
,
had
you
heard
his
*NL*
voice
at
that
moment
!
Have
you
forgot
the
last
evening
of
our
being
*NL*
together
at
Barton
?
The
morning
that
we
parted
too
!
When
he
told
me
*NL*
that
it
might
be
many
weeks
before
we
met
again
--
his
distress
--
can
I
*NL*
ever
forget
his
distress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
or
two
she
could
say
no
more
;
but
when
this
emotion
had
*NL*
passed
away
,
she
added
,
in
a
firmer
tone
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elinor
,
I
have
been
cruelly
used
;
but
not
by
Willoughby

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
Marianne

who
but

By
whom
can
he
have
been

instigated

``
By
all
the

could
rather

believe
every
creature

acquaintance
leagued
together
to
ruin
me
*NL*
in
his
opinion

than
believe
his
nature
capable
of
such
cruelty

This

he
writes

any
one
,
in
short
,
but
your

have
been
so
barbarous

bely
me

Beyond
you
three

is
there
a

world

I
would
not

rather
suspect
of
evil

*NL*
Elinor
would
not
contend

only
replied

have
been
so
*NL*
detestably
your
enemy
,
let
them
be
cheated
of
their
malignant
triumph
,
*NL*
my
dear
sister
,
by
seeing
how
nobly
the
consciousness
of
your
own
*NL*
innocence
and
good
intentions
supports
your
spirits
.
It
is
a
*NL*
reasonable
and
laudable
pride
which
resists
such
malevolence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
cried
Marianne
,
``
misery
such
as
mine
has
no
pride
.
I
care
*NL*
not
who
knows
that
I
am
wretched
.
The
triumph
of
seeing
me
so
may
be
*NL*
open
to
all
the
world
.
Elinor
,
Elinor
,
they
who
suffer
little
may
be
*NL*
proud
and
independent
as
they
like
--
may
resist
insult
,
or
return
*NL*
mortification

but
I
can
not

I
must
feel

I
must
be
wretched

they

enjoy
the
consciousness

*NL*
``
But
for

*NL*
``
I
would
do
more

appear
happy

am
so
*NL*
miserable

Oh
!
who
can
require
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
they
were
both
silent
.
Elinor
was
employed
in
walking
*NL*
thoughtfully
from
the
fire
to
the
window
,
from
the
window
to
the
fire
,
*NL*
without
knowing
that
she
received
warmth
from
one
,
or
discerning
*NL*
objects
through
the
other
;
and
Marianne
,
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
*NL*
with
her
head
leaning
against
one
of
its
posts
,
again
took
up
*NL*
Willoughby
's
letter
,
and
,
after
shuddering
over
every
sentence
,
*NL*
exclaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
much
!
Oh
,
Willoughby
,
Willoughby
,
could
this
be
yours
!
*NL*
Cruel
,
cruel
--
nothing
can
acquit
you
.
Elinor
,
nothing
can
.
Whatever
*NL*
he
might
have
heard
against
me
--
ought
he
not
to
have
suspended
his
*NL*
belief
?
ought
he
not
to
have
told
me
of
it
,
to
have
given
me
the
power
*NL*
of
clearing
myself
?
`
The
lock
of
hair
,
-LRB-
repeating
it
from
the
letter
,
-RRB-
*NL*
which
you
so
obligingly
bestowed
on
me
'
--
That
is
unpardonable
.
*NL*
Willoughby
,
where
was
your
heart
when
you
wrote
those
words
?
Oh
,
*NL*
barbarously
insolent
!
--
Elinor
,
can
he
be
justified
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Marianne
,
in
no
possible
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
this
woman
--
who
knows
what
her
art
may
have
been
?

how
long
it
*NL*
may
have
been
premeditated
,
and
how
deeply
contrived
by
her
!

Who
is
*NL*
she
?

Who
can
she
be

Whom
did
I
ever
hear
him
talk
of

young

*NL*
attractive
among
his
female
acquaintance

Oh

no
one

no

he
*NL*
talked
to

only
of
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
pause
ensued
;
Marianne
was
greatly
agitated
,
and
it
ended
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elinor
,
I
must
go
home
.
I
must
go
and
comfort
mama

Can
not
we
be
*NL*
gone
to-morrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow

Marianne

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

why
should
I
stay
here

I
came
only
for
Willoughby
's
sake

and
*NL*
now
who
cares
for
me
?
Who
regards
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
impossible
to
go
to-morrow

We
owe
Mrs.
Jennings
much
more

than
civility

civility
of
the
commonest

prevent
such
a

hasty
removal

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then

another

two

perhaps

I

The
pity

a

Middleton

Oh
,
what
would
HE
say
to
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
advised
her
to
lie
down
again
,
and
for
a
moment
she
did
so
;
but
*NL*
no
attitude
could
give
her
ease
;
and
in
restless
pain
of
mind
and
body
*NL*
she
moved
from
one
posture
to
another
,
till
growing
more
and
more
*NL*
hysterical
,
her
sister
could
with
difficulty
keep
her
on
the
bed
at
*NL*
all
,
and
for
some
time
was
fearful
of
being
constrained
to
call
for
*NL*
assistance
.
Some
lavender
drops
,
however
,
which
she
was
at
length
*NL*
persuaded
to
take
,
were
of
use
;
and
from
that
time
till
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
returned
,
she
continued
on
the
bed
quiet
and
motionless
.

CHAPTER
30
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
came
immediately
to
their
room
on
her
return
,
and
without
*NL*
waiting
to
have
her
request
of
admittance
answered
,
opened
the
door
and
*NL*
walked
in
with
a
look
of
real
concern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
my
dear
?
''
--
said
she
in
a
voice
of
great
compassion
to
*NL*
Marianne
,
who
turned
away
her
face
without
attempting
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
she
,
Miss
Dashwood
?
--
Poor
thing
!
she
looks
very
bad
.
--
No
*NL*
wonder
.
Ay
,
it
is
but
too
true
.
He
is
to
be
married
very
soon
--
a
*NL*
good-for-nothing
fellow
!
I
have
no
patience
with
him
.
Mrs.
Taylor
*NL*
told
me
of
it
half
an
hour
ago
,
and
she
was
told
it
by
a
particular
*NL*
friend
of
Miss
Grey
herself
,
else
I
am
sure
I
should
not
have
believed
*NL*
it
;
and
I
was
almost
ready
to
sink
as
it
was
.
Well
,
said
I
,
all
I
can
*NL*
say
is
,
that
if
this
be
true
,
he
has
used
a
young
lady
of
my
*NL*
acquaintance
abominably
ill
,
and
I
wish
with
all
my
soul
his
wife
may
*NL*
plague
his
heart
out
.
And
so
I
shall
always
say
,
my
dear
,
you
may
*NL*
depend
on
it
.
I
have
no
notion
of
men
's
going
on
in
this
way
;
and
if
*NL*
ever
I
meet
him
again
,
I
will
give
him
such
a
dressing
as
he
has
not
*NL*
had
this
many
a
day
.
But
there
is
one
comfort
,
my
dear
Miss
Marianne
;
*NL*
he
is
not
the
only
young
man
in
the
world
worth
having
;
and
with
your
*NL*
pretty
face
you
will
never
want
admirers
.
Well
,
poor
thing
!
I
wo
n't
*NL*
disturb
her
any
longer
,
for
she
had
better
have
her
cry
out
at
once
and
*NL*
have
done
with
.
The
Parrys
and
Sandersons
luckily
are
coming
tonight
*NL*
you
know
,
and
that
will
amuse
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
went
away
,
walking
on
tiptoe
out
of
the
room
,
as
if
she
*NL*
supposed
her
young
friend
's
affliction
could
be
increased
by
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
,
to
the
surprise
of
her
sister
,
determined
on
dining
with
*NL*
them
.
Elinor
even
advised
her
against
it
.
But
``
no
,
she
would
go
down
;
*NL*
she
could
bear
it
very
well
,
and
the
bustle
about
her
would
be
less
.
''
*NL*
Elinor
,
pleased
to
have
her
governed
for
a
moment
by
such
a
motive
,
*NL*
though
believing
it
hardly
possible
that
she
could
sit
out
the
dinner
,
*NL*
said
no
more
;
and
adjusting
her
dress
for
her
as
well
as
she
could
,
*NL*
while
Marianne
still
remained
on
the
bed
,
was
ready
to
assist
her
into
*NL*
the
dining
room
as
soon
as
they
were
summoned
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
there
,
though
looking
most
wretchedly
,
she
ate
more
and
was
calmer
*NL*
than
her
sister
had
expected
.
Had
she
tried
to
speak
,
or
had
she
been
*NL*
conscious
of
half
Mrs.
Jennings
's
well-meant
but
ill-judged
attentions
*NL*
to
her
,
this
calmness
could
not
have
been
maintained
;
but
not
a
*NL*
syllable
escaped
her
lips
;
and
the
abstraction
of
her
thoughts
*NL*
preserved
her
in
ignorance
of
every
thing
that
was
passing
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
who
did
justice
to
Mrs.
Jennings
's
kindness
,
though
its
*NL*
effusions
were
often
distressing
,
and
sometimes
almost
ridiculous
,
made
*NL*
her
those
acknowledgments
,
and
returned
her
those
civilities
,
which
her
*NL*
sister
could
not
make
or
return
for
herself
.
Their
good
friend
saw
*NL*
that
Marianne
was
unhappy
,
and
felt
that
every
thing
was
due
to
her
*NL*
which
might
make
her
at
all
less
so
.
She
treated
her
therefore
,
with
*NL*
all
the
indulgent
fondness
of
a
parent
towards
a
favourite
child
on
the
*NL*
last
day
of
its
holidays
.
Marianne
was
to
have
the
best
place
by
the
*NL*
fire
,
was
to
be
tempted
to
eat
by
every
delicacy
in
the
house
,
and
to
*NL*
be
amused
by
the
relation
of
all
the
news
of
the
day
.
Had
not
Elinor
,
*NL*
in
the
sad
countenance
of
her
sister
,
seen
a
check
to
all
mirth
,
she
*NL*
could
have
been
entertained
by
Mrs.
Jennings
's
endeavours
to
cure
a
*NL*
disappointment
in
love
,
by
a
variety
of
sweetmeats
and
olives
,
and
a
*NL*
good
fire
.
As
soon
,
however
,
as
the
consciousness
of
all
this
was
*NL*
forced
by
continual
repetition
on
Marianne
,
she
could
stay
no
longer
.
*NL*
With
a
hasty
exclamation
of
Misery
,
and
a
sign
to
her
sister
not
to
*NL*
follow
her
,
she
directly
got
up
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
soul
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Jennings
,
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
,
``
how
it
*NL*
grieves
me
to
see
her
!
And
I
declare
if
she
is
not
gone
away
without
*NL*
finishing
her
wine
!
And
the
dried
cherries
too
!
Lord
!
nothing
seems
*NL*
to
do
her
any
good
.
I
am
sure
if
I
knew
of
any
thing
she
would
like
,
I
*NL*
would
send
all
over
the
town
for
it
.
Well
,
it
is
the
oddest
thing
to
*NL*
me
,
that
a
man
should
use
such
a
pretty
girl
so
ill
!
But
when
there
is
*NL*
plenty
of
money
on
one
side
,
and
next
to
none
on
the
other
,
Lord
bless
*NL*
you
!
they
care
no
more
about
such
things
!

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lady
then
--
Miss
Grey
I
think
you
called
her
--
is
very
rich

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty
thousand
pounds

my
dear

Did
you
ever
see
her
?
a
smart
,
*NL*
stylish
girl
they
say
,
but
not
handsome
.
I
remember
her
aunt
very
*NL*
well
,
Biddy
Henshawe
;
she
married
a
very
wealthy
man
.
But
the
family
*NL*
are
all
rich
together

Fifty
thousand
pounds

by
all
accounts

it
*NL*
wo

come
before
it
's
wanted
;
for
they
say
he
is
all
to
pieces

No
*NL*
wonder

dashing
about
with
his
curricle
and
hunters
!
Well
,
it
do
n't
*NL*
signify
talking
;
but
when
a
young
man

be
who
he
will

comes

makes

love

pretty

promises
marriage

he
has
no
business

fly
*NL*
off
from
his
word

because
he
grows
poor

and
a
richer
girl
is
*NL*
ready
to
have
him

Why
do
n't
he
,
in
such
a
case
,
sell
his
horses
,
let
*NL*
his
house

turn
off
his
servants

and
make
a
thorough
reform
at
once
?
I
*NL*
warrant
you
,
Miss
Marianne
would
have
been
ready
to
wait
till
matters
*NL*
came
round
.
But
that
wo
n't
do
now-a-days
;
nothing
in
the
way
of
*NL*
pleasure
can
ever
be
given
up
by
the
young
men
of
this
age

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never

indeed
I
hardly
ever

kindness

quite
unnecessary

Marianne

I
dare
say

*NL*
will
not
leave
her
room
again
this
evening

I
shall
persuade
her
if
I
*NL*
can
to
go
early
to
bed

I
am
sure
she
wants
rest

``
Aye

I
believe

will

Let
her
name
her
own

supper

go
to
bed

Lord

no
wonder
she
has
been
looking
so
bad
and
*NL*
so
cast
down
this
last
week
or
two
,
for
this
matter
I
suppose
has
been
*NL*
hanging
over
her
head
as
long
as
that

And
so
the
letter

came

finished
it

Poor
soul

I
am
sure
if

had
had
a
notion

I
would
not
have
joked
her
about
it
for
all
my
money

But
then
you
*NL*
know
,
how
should
I
guess
such
a
thing
?
I
made
sure
of
its
being
*NL*
nothing
but
a
common
love
letter
,
and
you
know
young
people
like
to
be

laughed
at
about

how
concerned
Sir

be

Conduit
Street
in
my
way
home
,
and
told
them
of
it
.
But
I
*NL*
shall
see
them
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
unnecessary
I
am
sure
,
for
you
to
caution
Mrs.
Palmer
and
*NL*
Sir
John
against
ever
naming
Mr.
Willoughby
,
or
making
the
slightest
*NL*
allusion
to
what
has
passed
,
before
my
sister
.
Their
own
good-nature
*NL*
must
point
out
to
them
the
real
cruelty
of
appearing
to
know
any
thing
*NL*
about
it
when
she
is
present
;
and
the
less
that
may
ever
be
said
to
*NL*
myself
on
the
subject
,
the
more
my
feelings
will
be
spared
,
as
you
my
*NL*
dear
madam
will
easily
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Lord
!
yes
,
that
I
do
indeed
.
It
must
be
terrible
for
you
to
hear
*NL*
it
talked
of
;
and
as
for
your
sister
,
I
am
sure
I
would
not
mention
a
*NL*
word
about
it
to
her
for
the
world
.
You
saw
I
did
not
all
dinner
time
.
*NL*
No
more
would
Sir
John
,
nor
my
daughters
,
for
they
are
all
very
*NL*
thoughtful
and
considerate
;
especially
if
I
give
them
a
hint
,
as
I
*NL*
certainly
will
.
For
my
part
,
I
think
the
less
that
is
said
about
such
*NL*
things
,
the
better
,
the
sooner
't
is
blown
over
and
forgot
.
And
what
*NL*
does
talking
ever
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
this
affair
it
can
only
do
harm
;
more
so
perhaps
than
in
many
cases
*NL*
of
a
similar
kind
,
for
it
has
been
attended
by
circumstances
which
,
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
every
one
concerned
in
it
,
make
it
unfit
to
become
the
*NL*
public
conversation
.
I
must
do
THIS
justice
to
Mr.
Willoughby
--
he
has
*NL*
broken
no
positive
engagement
with
my
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Law
,
my
dear
!
Do
n't
pretend
to
defend
him
.
No
positive
engagement
*NL*
indeed
!
after
taking
her
all
over
Allenham
House
,
and
fixing
on
the
*NL*
very
rooms
they
were
to
live
in
hereafter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
for
her
sister
's
sake
,
could
not
press
the
subject
farther
,
and
*NL*
she
hoped
it
was
not
required
of
her
for
Willoughby
's
;
since
,
though
*NL*
Marianne
might
lose
much
,
he
could
gain
very
little
by
the
enforcement
*NL*
of
the
real
truth
.
After
a
short
silence
on
both
sides
,
Mrs.
Jennings
,
*NL*
with
all
her
natural
hilarity
,
burst
forth
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
't
is
a
true
saying
about
an
ill-wind
,
for
it
will
be
*NL*
all
the
better
for
Colonel
Brandon
.
He
will
have
her
at
last
;
aye
,
*NL*
that
he
will
.
Mind
me
,
now
,
if
they
a
n't
married
by
Mid-summer
.
Lord
!
*NL*
how
he
'll
chuckle
over
this
news
!
I
hope
he
will
come
tonight
.
It
*NL*
will
be
all
to
one
a
better
match
for
your
sister
.
Two
thousand
a
year
*NL*
without
debt
or
drawback
--
except
the
little
love-child
,
indeed
;
aye
,
I
*NL*
had
forgot
her
;
but
she
may
be
`
prenticed
out
at
a
small
cost
,
and
then
*NL*
what
does
it
signify
?
Delaford
is
a
nice
place
,
I
can
tell
you
;
*NL*
exactly
what
I
call
a
nice
old
fashioned
place
,
full
of
comforts
and
*NL*
conveniences
;
quite
shut
in
with
great
garden
walls
that
are
covered
*NL*
with
the
best
fruit-trees
in
the
country
;
and
such
a
mulberry
tree
in
*NL*
one
corner
!
Lord
!
how
Charlotte
and
I
did
stuff
the
only
time
we
were
*NL*
there
!
Then
,
there
is
a
dove-cote
,
some
delightful
stew-ponds
,
and
a
*NL*
very
pretty
canal
;
and
every
thing
,
in
short
,
that
one
could
wish
for
;
*NL*
and
,
moreover
,
it
is
close
to
the
church
,
and
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
*NL*
from
the
turnpike-road
,
so
't
is
never
dull
,
for
if
you
only
go
and
sit
*NL*
up
in
an
old
yew
arbour
behind
the
house
,
you
may
see
all
the
carriages
*NL*
that
pass
along
.
Oh
!
't
is
a
nice
place
!
A
butcher
hard
by
in
the
*NL*
village
,
and
the
parsonage-house
within
a
stone
's
throw
.
To
my
fancy
,
*NL*
a
thousand
times
prettier
than
Barton
Park
,
where
they
are
forced
to
*NL*
send
three
miles
for
their
meat
,
and
have
not
a
neighbour
nearer
than
*NL*
your
mother
.
Well
,
I
shall
spirit
up
the
Colonel
as
soon
as
I
can
.
*NL*
One
shoulder
of
mutton
,
you
know
,
drives
another
down
.
If
we
CAN
but
*NL*
put
Willoughby
out
of
her
head
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
if
we
can
do
THAT
,
Ma'am
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
we
shall
do
very
well
*NL*
with
or
without
Colonel
Brandon
.
''
And
then
rising
,
she
went
away
to
*NL*
join
Marianne
,
whom
she
found
,
as
she
expected
,
in
her
own
room
,
*NL*
leaning
,
in
silent
misery
,
over
the
small
remains
of
a
fire
,
which
,
*NL*
till
Elinor
's
entrance
,
had
been
her
only
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
leave
me
,
''
was
all
the
notice
that
her
sister
received
*NL*
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
leave
you
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
if
you
will
go
to
bed
.
''
But
this
,
*NL*
from
the
momentary
perverseness
of
impatient
suffering
,
she
at
first
*NL*
refused
to
do
.
Her
sister
's
earnest
,
though
gentle
persuasion
,
*NL*
however
,
soon
softened
her
to
compliance
,
and
Elinor
saw
her
lay
her
*NL*
aching
head
on
the
pillow
,
and
as
she
hoped
,
in
a
way
to
get
some
quiet
*NL*
rest
before
she
left
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
drawing-room
,
whither
she
then
repaired
,
she
was
soon
joined
by
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
,
with
a
wine-glass
,
full
of
something
,
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
she
,
entering
,
``
I
have
just
recollected
that
I
have
*NL*
some
of
the
finest
old
Constantia
wine
in
the
house
that
ever
was
*NL*
tasted
,
so
I
have
brought
a
glass
of
it
for
your
sister
.
My
poor
*NL*
husband
!
how
fond
he
was
of
it
!
Whenever
he
had
a
touch
of
his
old
*NL*
colicky
gout
,
he
said
it
did
him
more
good
than
any
thing
else
in
the
*NL*
world
.
Do
take
it
to
your
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Ma'am
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
smiling
at
the
difference
of
the
*NL*
complaints
for
which
it
was
recommended
,
``
how
good
you
are
!
But
I
have
*NL*
just
left
Marianne
in
bed
,
and
,
I
hope
,
almost
asleep
;
and
as
I
think
*NL*
nothing
will
be
of
so
much
service
to
her
as
rest
,
if
you
will
give
me
*NL*
leave
,
I
will
drink
the
wine
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
,
though
regretting
that
she
had
not
been
five
minutes
*NL*
earlier
,
was
satisfied
with
the
compromise
;
and
Elinor
,
as
she
*NL*
swallowed
the
chief
of
it
,
reflected
,
that
though
its
effects
on
a
*NL*
colicky
gout
were
,
at
present
,
of
little
importance
to
her
,
its
healing
*NL*
powers
,
on
a
disappointed
heart
might
be
as
reasonably
tried
on
herself
*NL*
as
on
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
came
in
while
the
party
were
at
tea
,
and
by
his
manner
*NL*
of
looking
round
the
room
for
Marianne
,
Elinor
immediately
fancied
that
*NL*
he
neither
expected
nor
wished
to
see
her
there
,
and
,
in
short
,
that
he
*NL*
was
already
aware
of
what
occasioned
her
absence
.
Mrs.
Jennings
was
*NL*
not
struck
by
the
same
thought
;
for
soon
after
his
entrance
,
she
walked
*NL*
across
the
room
to
the
tea-table
where
Elinor
presided
,
and
whispered
--
*NL*
``
The
Colonel
looks
as
grave
as
ever
you
see
.
He
knows
nothing
of
it
;
*NL*
do
tell
him
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shortly
afterwards
drew
a
chair
close
to
hers
,
and
,
with
a
look
*NL*
which
perfectly
assured
her
of
his
good
information
,
inquired
after
her
*NL*
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marianne
is
not
well
,
''
said
she
.
``
She
has
been
indisposed
all
day
,
*NL*
and
we
have
persuaded
her
to
go
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
then
,
''
he
hesitatingly
replied
,
``
what
I
heard
this
morning
*NL*
may
be
--
there
may
be
more
truth
in
it
than
I
could
believe
possible
at
*NL*
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
a
gentleman
,
whom
I
had
reason
to
think
--
in
short
,
that
a
man
,
*NL*
whom
I
KNEW
to
be
engaged
--
but
how
shall
I
tell
you
?
If
you
know
it
*NL*
already
,
as
surely
you
must
,
I
may
be
spared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
,
''
answered
Elinor
,
with
forced
calmness
,
``
Mr.
Willoughby
's
*NL*
marriage
with
Miss
Grey
.
Yes
,
we
DO
know
it
all
.
This
seems
to
have
*NL*
been
a
day
of
general
elucidation
,
for
this
very
morning
first
unfolded
*NL*
it
to
us
.
Mr.
Willoughby
is
unfathomable
!
Where
did
you
hear
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
stationer
's
shop
in
Pall
Mall
,
where
I
had
business
.
Two
ladies
*NL*
were
waiting
for
their
carriage
,
and
one
of
them
was
giving
the
other
*NL*
an
account
of
the
intended
match
,
in
a
voice
so
little
attempting
*NL*
concealment
,
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
not
to
hear
all
.
The
name
*NL*
of
Willoughby
,
John
Willoughby
,
frequently
repeated
,
first
caught
my
*NL*
attention
;
and
what
followed
was
a
positive
assertion
that
every
thing
*NL*
was
now
finally
settled
respecting
his
marriage
with
Miss
Grey
--
it
was
*NL*
no
longer
to
be
a
secret
--
it
would
take
place
even
within
a
few
weeks
,
*NL*
with
many
particulars
of
preparations
and
other
matters
.
One
thing
,
*NL*
especially
,
I
remember
,
because
it
served
to
identify
the
man
still
*NL*
more
:
--
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
was
over
,
they
were
to
go
to
Combe
*NL*
Magna
,
his
seat
in
Somersetshire
.
My
astonishment
!
--
but
it
would
be
*NL*
impossible
to
describe
what
I
felt
.
The
communicative
lady
I
learnt
,
*NL*
on
inquiry
,
for
I
stayed
in
the
shop
till
they
were
gone
,
was
a
Mrs.
*NL*
Ellison
,
and
that
,
as
I
have
been
since
informed
,
is
the
name
of
Miss
*NL*
Grey
's
guardian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
.
But
have
you
likewise
heard
that
Miss
Grey
has
fifty
thousand
*NL*
pounds
?
In
that
,
if
in
any
thing
,
we
may
find
an
explanation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
so
;
but
Willoughby
is
capable
--
at
least
I
think
''
--
he
stopped
*NL*
a
moment
;
then
added
in
a
voice
which
seemed
to
distrust
itself
,
``
And
*NL*
your
sister
--
how
did
she
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
sufferings
have
been
very
severe
.
I
have
only
to
hope
that
they
*NL*
may
be
proportionately
short
.
It
has
been
,
it
is
a
most
cruel
*NL*
affliction
.
Till
yesterday
,
I
believe
,
she
never
doubted
his
regard
;
*NL*
and
even
now
,
perhaps
--
but
I
am
almost
convinced
that
he
never
was
*NL*
really
attached
to
her
.
He
has
been
very
deceitful
!
and
,
in
some
*NL*
points
,
there
seems
a
hardness
of
heart
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Colonel
Brandon
,
``
there
is
,
indeed
!
But
your
sister
does
*NL*
not
--
I
think
you
said
so
--
she
does
not
consider
quite
as
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
her
disposition
,
and
may
believe
how
eagerly
she
would
still
*NL*
justify
him
if
she
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
answer
;
and
soon
afterwards
,
by
the
removal
of
the
*NL*
tea-things
,
and
the
arrangement
of
the
card
parties
,
the
subject
was
*NL*
necessarily
dropped
.
Mrs.
Jennings
,
who
had
watched
them
with
pleasure
*NL*
while
they
were
talking
,
and
who
expected
to
see
the
effect
of
Miss
*NL*
Dashwood
's
communication
,
in
such
an
instantaneous
gaiety
on
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
's
side
,
as
might
have
become
a
man
in
the
bloom
of
youth
,
of
*NL*
hope
and
happiness
,
saw
him
,
with
amazement
,
remain
the
whole
evening
*NL*
more
serious
and
thoughtful
than
usual
.

CHAPTER
31
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
night
of
more
sleep
than
she
had
expected
,
Marianne
awoke
the
*NL*
next
morning
to
the
same
consciousness
of
misery
in
which
she
had
*NL*
closed
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
encouraged
her
as
much
as
possible
to
talk
of
what
she
felt
;
and
*NL*
before
breakfast
was
ready
,
they
had
gone
through
the
subject
again
and
*NL*
again
;
and
with
the
same
steady
conviction
and
affectionate
counsel
on
*NL*
Elinor
's
side
,
the
same
impetuous
feelings
and
varying
opinions
on
*NL*
Marianne
's
,
as
before
.
Sometimes
she
could
believe
Willoughby
to
be
as
*NL*
unfortunate
and
as
innocent
as
herself
,
and
at
others
,
lost
every
*NL*
consolation
in
the
impossibility
of
acquitting
him
.
At
one
moment
she
*NL*
was
absolutely
indifferent
to
the
observation
of
all
the
world
,
at
*NL*
another
she
would
seclude
herself
from
it
for
ever
,
and
at
a
third
*NL*
could
resist
it
with
energy
.
In
one
thing
,
however
,
she
was
uniform
,
*NL*
when
it
came
to
the
point
,
in
avoiding
,
where
it
was
possible
,
the
*NL*
presence
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
and
in
a
determined
silence
when
obliged
to
*NL*
endure
it
.
Her
heart
was
hardened
against
the
belief
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
's
entering
into
her
sorrows
with
any
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
it
can
not
be
,
''
she
cried
;
``
she
can
not
feel
.
Her
kindness
*NL*
is
not
sympathy
;
her
good-nature
is
not
tenderness
.
All
that
she
wants
*NL*
is
gossip
,
and
she
only
likes
me
now
because
I
supply
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
had
not
needed
this
to
be
assured
of
the
injustice
to
which
her
*NL*
sister
was
often
led
in
her
opinion
of
others
,
by
the
irritable
*NL*
refinement
of
her
own
mind
,
and
the
too
great
importance
placed
by
her
*NL*
on
the
delicacies
of
a
strong
sensibility
,
and
the
graces
of
a
polished
*NL*
manner
.
Like
half
the
rest
of
the
world
,
if
more
than
half
there
be
*NL*
that
are
clever
and
good
,
Marianne
,
with
excellent
abilities
and
an
*NL*
excellent
disposition
,
was
neither
reasonable
nor
candid
.
She
expected
*NL*
from
other
people
the
same
opinions
and
feelings
as
her
own
,
and
she
*NL*
judged
of
their
motives
by
the
immediate
effect
of
their
actions
on
*NL*
herself
.
Thus
a
circumstance
occurred
,
while
the
sisters
were
together
*NL*
in
their
own
room
after
breakfast
,
which
sunk
the
heart
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
still
lower
in
her
estimation
;
because
,
through
her
own
*NL*
weakness
,
it
chanced
to
prove
a
source
of
fresh
pain
to
herself
,
though
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
was
governed
in
it
by
an
impulse
of
the
utmost
goodwill
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
letter
in
her
outstretched
hand
,
and
countenance
gaily
smiling
,
*NL*
from
the
persuasion
of
bringing
comfort
,
she
entered
their
room
,
saying
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
dear
,
I
bring
you
something
that
I
am
sure
will
do
you
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
heard
enough
.
In
one
moment
her
imagination
placed
before
her
*NL*
a
letter
from
Willoughby
,
full
of
tenderness
and
contrition
,
*NL*
explanatory
of
all
that
had
passed
,
satisfactory
,
convincing
;
and
*NL*
instantly
followed
by
Willoughby
himself
,
rushing
eagerly
into
the
room
*NL*
to
inforce
,
at
her
feet
,
by
the
eloquence
of
his
eyes
,
the
assurances
*NL*
of
his
letter
.
The
work
of
one
moment
was
destroyed
by
the
next
.
The
*NL*
hand
writing
of
her
mother
,
never
till
then
unwelcome
,
was
before
her
;
*NL*
and
,
in
the
acuteness
of
the
disappointment
which
followed
such
an
*NL*
ecstasy
of
more
than
hope
,
she
felt
as
if
,
till
that
instant
,
she
had
*NL*
never
suffered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cruelty
of
Mrs.
Jennings
no
language
,
within
her
reach
in
her
*NL*
moments
of
happiest
eloquence
,
could
have
expressed
;
and
now
she
could
*NL*
reproach
her
only
by
the
tears
which
streamed
from
her
eyes
with
*NL*
passionate
violence
--
a
reproach
,
however
,
so
entirely
lost
on
its
*NL*
object
,
that
after
many
expressions
of
pity
,
she
withdrew
,
still
*NL*
referring
her
to
the
letter
of
comfort
.
But
the
letter
,
when
she
was
*NL*
calm
enough
to
read
it
,
brought
little
comfort
.
Willoughby
filled
*NL*
every
page
.
Her
mother
,
still
confident
of
their
engagement
,
and
*NL*
relying
as
warmly
as
ever
on
his
constancy
,
had
only
been
roused
by
*NL*
Elinor
's
application
,
to
intreat
from
Marianne
greater
openness
towards
*NL*
them
both
;
and
this
,
with
such
tenderness
towards
her
,
such
affection
*NL*
for
Willoughby
,
and
such
a
conviction
of
their
future
happiness
in
each
*NL*
other
,
that
she
wept
with
agony
through
the
whole
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
her
impatience
to
be
at
home
again
now
returned
;
her
mother
was
*NL*
dearer
to
her
than
ever
;
dearer
through
the
very
excess
of
her
mistaken
*NL*
confidence
in
Willoughby
,
and
she
was
wildly
urgent
to
be
gone
.
*NL*
Elinor
,
unable
herself
to
determine
whether
it
were
better
for
Marianne
*NL*
to
be
in
London
or
at
Barton
,
offered
no
counsel
of
her
own
except
of
*NL*
patience
till
their
mother
's
wishes
could
be
known
;
and
at
length
she
*NL*
obtained
her
sister
's
consent
to
wait
for
that
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
left
them
earlier
than
usual
;
for
she
could
not
be
easy
*NL*
till
the
Middletons
and
Palmers
were
able
to
grieve
as
much
as
herself
;
*NL*
and
positively
refusing
Elinor
's
offered
attendance
,
went
out
alone
for
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
morning
.
Elinor
,
with
a
very
heavy
heart
,
aware
of
the
*NL*
pain
she
was
going
to
communicate
,
and
perceiving
,
by
Marianne
's
*NL*
letter
,
how
ill
she
had
succeeded
in
laying
any
foundation
for
it
,
then
*NL*
sat
down
to
write
her
mother
an
account
of
what
had
passed
,
and
entreat
*NL*
her
directions
for
the
future
;
while
Marianne
,
who
came
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
on
Mrs.
Jennings
's
going
away
,
remained
fixed
at
the
table
*NL*
where
Elinor
wrote
,
watching
the
advancement
of
her
pen
,
grieving
over
*NL*
her
for
the
hardship
of
such
a
task
,
and
grieving
still
more
fondly
*NL*
over
its
effect
on
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
they
had
continued
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
when
*NL*
Marianne
,
whose
nerves
could
not
then
bear
any
sudden
noise
,
was
*NL*
startled
by
a
rap
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
can
this
be
?
''
cried
Elinor
.
``
So
early
too
!
I
thought
we
HAD
been
*NL*
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
moved
to
the
window
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Colonel
Brandon
!
''
said
she
,
with
vexation
.
``
We
are
never
safe
*NL*
from
HIM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
not
come
in
,
as
Mrs.
Jennings
is
from
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
trust
to
THAT
,
''
retreating
to
her
own
room
.
``
A
man
who
has
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
his
own
time
has
no
conscience
in
his
intrusion
on
*NL*
that
of
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
event
proved
her
conjecture
right
,
though
it
was
founded
on
*NL*
injustice
and
error
;
for
Colonel
Brandon
DID
come
in
;
and
Elinor
,
who
*NL*
was
convinced
that
solicitude
for
Marianne
brought
him
thither
,
and
who
*NL*
saw
THAT
solicitude
in
his
disturbed
and
melancholy
look
,
and
in
his
*NL*
anxious
though
brief
inquiry
after
her
,
could
not
forgive
her
sister
*NL*
for
esteeming
him
so
lightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
Mrs.
Jennings
in
Bond
Street
,
''
said
he
,
after
the
first
*NL*
salutation
,
``
and
she
encouraged
me
to
come
on
;
and
I
was
the
more
*NL*
easily
encouraged
,
because
I
thought
it
probable
that
I
might
find
you
*NL*
alone
,
which
I
was
very
desirous
of
doing
.
My
object
--
my
wish
--
my
sole
*NL*
wish
in
desiring
it
--
I
hope
,
I
believe
it
is
--
is
to
be
a
means
of
*NL*
giving
comfort
;
--
no
,
I
must
not
say
comfort
--
not
present
comfort

but
*NL*
conviction
,
lasting
conviction
to
your
sister
's
mind
.
My
regard
for
*NL*
her
,
for
yourself
,
for
your
mother
--
will
you
allow
me
to
prove
it
,
by
*NL*
relating
some
circumstances
which
nothing
but
a
VERY
sincere
*NL*
regard
--
nothing
but
an
earnest
desire

being
useful

I
think
I

justified

where
so
many
hours
have
been
spent
in
convincing

myself
that
I
am
right

is
there
not
some
reason
to
fear
I
may
be
*NL*
wrong

He
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
you
,
''
said
Elinor
.
``
You
have
something
to
tell
me
of
Mr.
*NL*
Willoughby

that
will
open
his
character
farther

Your
telling
it
will
*NL*
be
the
greatest
act
of
friendship
that
can
be
shewn
Marianne

MY
*NL*
gratitude
will
be
insured
immediately
by
any
information
tending
to
*NL*
that
end

HERS
must
be
gained
by
it

hear

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall

Barton

October

sighing
heavily

I
have
little

temptation

be

*NL*
*NL*
He
stopt
a
moment
for
recollection
,
and
then
,
with
another
sigh
,
went
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
probably
entirely
forgotten
a
conversation

-LRB-
it
is
not
to
be
*NL*
supposed
that

could
make
any
impression
on
you

--
a
conversation
*NL*
between
us
one
evening
at
Barton
Park
--
it
was
the
evening
of
a
*NL*
dance
--
in
which
I
alluded
to
a
lady
I
had
once
known
,
as
resembling
,
in
*NL*
some
measure
,
your
sister
Marianne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
answered
Elinor
,
``
I
have
NOT
forgotten
it
.
''
He
looked
pleased
*NL*
by
this
remembrance
,
and
added
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
am
not
deceived
by
the
uncertainty
,
the
partiality
of
tender
*NL*
recollection
,
there
is
a
very
strong
resemblance
between
them
,
as
well
*NL*
in
mind
as
person
.
The
same
warmth
of
heart
,
the
same
eagerness
of
*NL*
fancy
and
spirits
.
This
lady
was
one
of
my
nearest
relations
,
an
*NL*
orphan
from
her
infancy
,
and
under
the
guardianship
of
my
father
.
Our
*NL*
ages
were
nearly
the
same
,
and
from
our
earliest
years
we
were
*NL*
playfellows
and
friends
.
I
can
not
remember
the
time
when
I
did
not
*NL*
love
Eliza
;
and
my
affection
for
her
,
as
we
grew
up
,
was
such
,
as
*NL*
perhaps
,
judging
from
my
present
forlorn
and
cheerless
gravity
,
you
*NL*
might
think
me
incapable
of
having
ever
felt
.
Hers
,
for
me
,
was
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
fervent
as
the
attachment
of
your
sister
to
Mr.
Willoughby
and
*NL*
it
was
,
though
from
a
different
cause
,
no
less
unfortunate
.
At
*NL*
seventeen
she
was
lost
to
me
for
ever
.
She
was
married
--
married
*NL*
against
her
inclination
to
my
brother
.
Her
fortune
was
large
,
and
our
*NL*
family
estate
much
encumbered
.
And
this
,
I
fear
,
is
all
that
can
be
*NL*
said
for
the
conduct
of
one
,
who
was
at
once
her
uncle
and
guardian
.
*NL*
My
brother
did
not
deserve
her
;
he
did
not
even
love
her
.
I
had
hoped
*NL*
that
her
regard
for
me
would
support
her
under
any
difficulty
,
and
for
*NL*
some
time
it
did
;
but
at
last
the
misery
of
her
situation
,
for
she
*NL*
experienced
great
unkindness
,
overcame
all
her
resolution
,
and
though
*NL*
she
had
promised
me
that
nothing
--
but
how
blindly
I
relate
!
I
have
*NL*
never
told
you
how
this
was
brought
on
.
We
were
within
a
few
hours
of
*NL*
eloping
together
for
Scotland
.
The
treachery
,
or
the
folly
,
of
my
*NL*
cousin
's
maid
betrayed
us
.
I
was
banished
to
the
house
of
a
relation
*NL*
far
distant
,
and
she
was
allowed
no
liberty
,
no
society
,
no
amusement
,
*NL*
till
my
father
's
point
was
gained
.
I
had
depended
on
her
fortitude
too
*NL*
far
,
and
the
blow
was
a
severe
one
--
but
had
her
marriage
been
happy
,
so
*NL*
young
as
I
then
was
,
a
few
months
must
have
reconciled
me
to
it
,
or
at
*NL*
least
I
should
not
have
now
to
lament
it
.
This
however
was
not
the
*NL*
case
.
My
brother
had
no
regard
for
her
;
his
pleasures
were
not
what
*NL*
they
ought
to
have
been
,
and
from
the
first
he
treated
her
unkindly
.
*NL*
The
consequence
of
this
,
upon
a
mind
so
young
,
so
lively
,
so
*NL*
inexperienced
as
Mrs.
Brandon
's
,
was
but
too
natural
.
She
resigned
*NL*
herself
at
first
to
all
the
misery
of
her
situation
;
and
happy
had
it
*NL*
been
if
she
had
not
lived
to
overcome
those
regrets
which
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
me
occasioned
.
But
can
we
wonder
that
,
with
such
a
*NL*
husband
to
provoke
inconstancy
,
and
without
a
friend
to
advise
or
*NL*
restrain
her
-LRB-
for
my
father
lived
only
a
few
months
after
their
*NL*
marriage
,
and
I
was
with
my
regiment
in
the
East
Indies
-RRB-
she
should
*NL*
fall
?
Had
I
remained
in
England
,
perhaps
--
but
I
meant
to
promote
the
*NL*
happiness
of
both
by
removing
from
her
for
years
,
and
for
that
purpose
*NL*
had
procured
my
exchange
.
The
shock
which
her
marriage
had
given
me
,
''
*NL*
he
continued
,
in
a
voice
of
great
agitation
,
``
was
of
trifling
*NL*
weight
--
was
nothing
to
what
I
felt
when
I
heard
,
about
two
years
*NL*
afterwards
,
of
her
divorce
.
It
was
THAT
which
threw
this
gloom
,
--
even
*NL*
now
the
recollection
of
what
I
suffered
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
say
no
more
,
and
rising
hastily
walked
for
a
few
minutes
about
*NL*
the
room
.
Elinor
,
affected
by
his
relation
,
and
still
more
by
his
*NL*
distress
,
could
not
speak
.
He
saw
her
concern
,
and
coming
to
her
,
took
*NL*
her
hand
,
pressed
it
,
and
kissed
it
with
grateful
respect
.
A
few
*NL*
minutes
more
of
silent
exertion
enabled
him
to
proceed
with
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
nearly
three
years
after
this
unhappy
period
before
I
returned
*NL*
to
England
.
My
first
care
,
when
I
DID
arrive
,
was
of
course
to
seek
*NL*
for
her
;
but
the
search
was
as
fruitless
as
it
was
melancholy
.
I
could
*NL*
not
trace
her
beyond
her
first
seducer
,
and
there
was
every
reason
to
*NL*
fear
that
she
had
removed
from
him
only
to
sink
deeper
in
a
life
of
*NL*
sin
.
Her
legal
allowance
was
not
adequate
to
her
fortune
,
nor
*NL*
sufficient
for
her
comfortable
maintenance
,
and
I
learnt
from
my
*NL*
brother
that
the
power
of
receiving
it
had
been
made
over
some
months
*NL*
before
to
another
person
.
He
imagined
,
and
calmly
could
he
imagine
it
,
*NL*
that
her
extravagance
,
and
consequent
distress
,
had
obliged
her
to
*NL*
dispose
of
it
for
some
immediate
relief
.
At
last
,
however
,
and
after
I
*NL*
had
been
six
months
in
England
,
I
DID
find
her
.
Regard
for
a
former
*NL*
servant
of
my
own
,
who
had
since
fallen
into
misfortune
,
carried
me
to
*NL*
visit
him
in
a
spunging-house
,
where
he
was
confined
for
debt
;
and
*NL*
there
,
in
the
same
house
,
under
a
similar
confinement
,
was
my
unfortunate
*NL*
sister
.
So
altered
--
so
faded
--
worn
down
by
acute
suffering
of
every
*NL*
kind
!
hardly
could
I
believe
the
melancholy
and
sickly
figure
before
*NL*
me
,
to
be
the
remains
of
the
lovely
,
blooming
,
healthful
girl
,
on
whom
*NL*
I
had
once
doted
.
What
I
endured
in
so
beholding
her
--
but
I
have
no
*NL*
right
to
wound
your
feelings
by
attempting
to
describe
it
--
I
have
*NL*
pained
you
too
much
already
.
That
she
was
,
to
all
appearance
,
in
the
*NL*
last
stage
of
a
consumption
,
was
--
yes
,
in
such
a
situation
it
was
my
*NL*
greatest
comfort
.
Life
could
do
nothing
for
her
,
beyond
giving
time
*NL*
for
a
better
preparation
for
death
;
and
that
was
given
.
I
saw
her
*NL*
placed
in
comfortable
lodgings
,
and
under
proper
attendants
;
I
visited
*NL*
her
every
day
during
the
rest
of
her
short
life
:
I
was
with
her
in
her
*NL*
last
moments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
stopped
to
recover
himself
;
and
Elinor
spoke
her
feelings
in
*NL*
an
exclamation
of
tender
concern
,
at
the
fate
of
his
unfortunate
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sister
,
I
hope
,
can
not
be
offended
,
''
said
he
,
``
by
the
resemblance
*NL*
I
have
fancied
between
her
and
my
poor
disgraced
relation
.
Their
*NL*
fates
,
their
fortunes
,
can
not
be
the
same
;
and
had
the
natural
sweet
*NL*
disposition
of
the
one
been
guarded
by
a
firmer
mind
,
or
a
happier
*NL*
marriage
,
she
might
have
been
all
that
you
will
live
to
see
the
other
*NL*
be
.
But
to
what
does
all
this
lead
?
I
seem
to
have
been
distressing
*NL*
you
for
nothing
.
Ah
!
Miss
Dashwood
--
a
subject
such
as
this
--
untouched
*NL*
for
fourteen
years
--
it
is
dangerous
to
handle
it
at
all
!
I
WILL
be
*NL*
more
collected
--
more
concise
.
She
left
to
my
care
her
only
child
,
a
*NL*
little
girl
,
the
offspring
of
her
first
guilty
connection
,
who
was
then
*NL*
about
three
years
old
.
She
loved
the
child
,
and
had
always
kept
it
*NL*
with
her
.
It
was
a
valued
,
a
precious
trust
to
me
;
and
gladly
would
I
*NL*
have
discharged
it
in
the
strictest
sense
,
by
watching
over
her
*NL*
education
myself
,
had
the
nature
of
our
situations
allowed
it
;
but
I
*NL*
had
no
family
,
no
home
;
and
my
little
Eliza
was
therefore
placed
at
*NL*
school
.
I
saw
her
there
whenever
I
could
,
and
after
the
death
of
my
*NL*
brother
,
-LRB-
which
happened
about
five
years
ago
,
and
which
left
to
me
the
*NL*
possession
of
the
family
property
,
-RRB-
she
visited
me
at
Delaford
.
I
*NL*
called
her
a
distant
relation
;
but
I
am
well
aware
that
I
have
in
*NL*
general
been
suspected
of
a
much
nearer
connection
with
her
.
It
is
now
*NL*
three
years
ago
-LRB-
she
had
just
reached
her
fourteenth
year
,
-RRB-
that
I
*NL*
removed
her
from
school
,
to
place
her
under
the
care
of
a
very
*NL*
respectable
woman
,
residing
in
Dorsetshire
,
who
had
the
charge
of
four
*NL*
or
five
other
girls
of
about
the
same
time
of
life
;
and
for
two
years
I
*NL*
had
every
reason
to
be
pleased
with
her
situation
.
But
last
February
,
*NL*
almost
a
twelvemonth
back
,
she
suddenly
disappeared
.
I
had
allowed
*NL*
her
,
-LRB-
imprudently
,
as
it
has
since
turned
out
,
-RRB-
at
her
earnest
desire
,
*NL*
to
go
to
Bath
with
one
of
her
young
friends
,
who
was
attending
her
*NL*
father
there
for
his
health
.
I
knew
him
to
be
a
very
good
sort
of
man
,
*NL*
and
I
thought
well
of
his
daughter
--
better
than
she
deserved
,
for
,
with
*NL*
a
most
obstinate
and
ill-judged
secrecy
,
she
would
tell
nothing
,
would
*NL*
give
no
clue
,
though
she
certainly
knew
all
.
He
,
her
father
,
a
*NL*
well-meaning
,
but
not
a
quick-sighted
man
,
could
really
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
give
no
information
;
for
he
had
been
generally
confined
to
the
house
,
*NL*
while
the
girls
were
ranging
over
the
town
and
making
what
acquaintance
*NL*
they
chose
;
and
he
tried
to
convince
me
,
as
thoroughly
as
he
was
*NL*
convinced
himself
,
of
his
daughter
's
being
entirely
unconcerned
in
the
*NL*
business
.
In
short
,
I
could
learn
nothing
but
that
she
was
gone
;
all
*NL*
the
rest
,
for
eight
long
months
,
was
left
to
conjecture
.
What
I
*NL*
thought
,
what
I
feared
,
may
be
imagined
;
and
what
I
suffered
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
cried
Elinor
,
``
could
it
be
--
could
Willoughby
!
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
news
that
reached
me
of
her
,
''
he
continued
,
``
came
in
a
*NL*
letter
from
herself
,
last
October
.
It
was
forwarded
to
me
from
*NL*
Delaford
,
and
I
received
it
on
the
very
morning
of
our
intended
party
*NL*
to
Whitwell
;
and
this
was
the
reason
of
my
leaving
Barton
so
suddenly
,
*NL*
which
I
am
sure
must
at
the
time
have
appeared
strange
to
every
body
,
*NL*
and
which
I
believe
gave
offence
to
some
.
Little
did
Mr.
Willoughby
*NL*
imagine
,
I
suppose
,
when
his
looks
censured
me
for
incivility
in
*NL*
breaking
up
the
party
,
that
I
was
called
away
to
the
relief
of
one
whom
*NL*
he
had
made
poor
and
miserable
;
but
HAD
he
known
it
,
what
would
it
have
*NL*
availed
?
Would
he
have
been
less
gay
or
less
happy
in
the
smiles
of
*NL*
your
sister
?
No
,
he
had
already
done
that
,
which
no
man
who
CAN
feel
*NL*
for
another
would
do
.
He
had
left
the
girl
whose
youth
and
innocence
*NL*
he
had
seduced
,
in
a
situation
of
the
utmost
distress
,
with
no
*NL*
creditable
home
,
no
help
,
no
friends
,
ignorant
of
his
address
!
He
had
*NL*
left
her
,
promising
to
return
;
he
neither
returned
,
nor
wrote
,
nor
*NL*
relieved
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
beyond
every
thing
!
''
exclaimed
Elinor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
character
is
now
before
you
;
expensive
,
dissipated
,
and
worse
than
*NL*
both
.
Knowing
all
this
,
as
I
have
now
known
it
many
weeks
,
guess
what
*NL*
I
must
have
felt
on
seeing
your
sister
as
fond
of
him
as
ever
,
and
on
*NL*
being
assured
that
she
was
to
marry
him
:
guess
what
I
must
have
felt
*NL*
for
all
your
sakes
.
When
I
came
to
you
last
week
and
found
you
alone
,
*NL*
I
came
determined
to
know
the
truth
;
though
irresolute
what
to
do
when
*NL*
it
WAS
known
.
My
behaviour
must
have
seemed
strange
to
you
then
;
but
*NL*
now
you
will
comprehend
it
.
To
suffer
you
all
to
be
so
deceived
;
to
*NL*
see
your
sister
--
but
what
could
I
do
?
I
had
no
hope
of
interfering
*NL*
with
success
;
and
sometimes
I
thought
your
sister
's
influence
might
yet
*NL*
reclaim
him
.
But
now
,
after
such
dishonorable
usage
,
who
can
tell
what
*NL*
were
his
designs
on
her
.
Whatever
they
may
have
been
,
however
,
she
may
*NL*
now
,
and
hereafter
doubtless
WILL
turn
with
gratitude
towards
her
own
*NL*
condition
,
when
she
compares
it
with
that
of
my
poor
Eliza
,
when
she
*NL*
considers
the
wretched
and
hopeless
situation
of
this
poor
girl
,
and
*NL*
pictures
her
to
herself
,
with
an
affection
for
him
so
strong
,
still
as
*NL*
strong
as
her
own
,
and
with
a
mind
tormented
by
self-reproach
,
which
*NL*
must
attend
her
through
life
.
Surely
this
comparison
must
have
its
use
*NL*
with
her
.
She
will
feel
her
own
sufferings
to
be
nothing
.
They
*NL*
proceed
from
no
misconduct
,
and
can
bring
no
disgrace
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
every
friend
must
be
made
still
more
her
friend
by
them
.
*NL*
Concern
for
her
unhappiness
,
and
respect
for
her
fortitude
under
it
,
*NL*
must
strengthen
every
attachment
.
Use
your
own
discretion
,
however
,
in
*NL*
communicating
to
her
what
I
have
told
you
.
You
must
know
best
what
*NL*
will
be
its
effect
;
but
had
I
not
seriously
,
and
from
my
heart
believed
*NL*
it
might
be
of
service
,
might
lessen
her
regrets
,
I
would
not
have
*NL*
suffered
myself
to
trouble
you
with
this
account
of
my
family
*NL*
afflictions
,
with
a
recital
which
may
seem
to
have
been
intended
to
*NL*
raise
myself
at
the
expense
of
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
thanks
followed
this
speech
with
grateful
earnestness
;
*NL*
attended
too
with
the
assurance
of
her
expecting
material
advantage
to
*NL*
Marianne
,
from
the
communication
of
what
had
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
more
pained
,
''
said
she
,
``
by
her
endeavors
to
acquit
him
*NL*
than
by
all
the
rest
;
for
it
irritates
her
mind
more
than
the
most
*NL*
perfect
conviction
of
his
unworthiness
can
do
.
Now
,
though
at
first
*NL*
she
will
suffer
much
,
I
am
sure
she
will
soon
become
easier
.
Have
*NL*
you
,
''
she
continued
,
after
a
short
silence
,
``
ever
seen
Mr.
Willoughby
*NL*
since
you
left
him
at
Barton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
replied
gravely
,
``
once
I
have
.
One
meeting
was
unavoidable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
startled
by
his
manner
,
looked
at
him
anxiously
,
saying
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
have
you
met
him
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
meet
him
no
other
way
.
Eliza
had
confessed
to
me
,
though
most
*NL*
reluctantly
,
the
name
of
her
lover
;
and
when
he
returned
to
town
,
which
*NL*
was
within
a
fortnight
after
myself
,
we
met
by
appointment
,
he
to
*NL*
defend
,
I
to
punish
his
conduct
.
We
returned
unwounded
,
and
the
*NL*
meeting
,
therefore
,
never
got
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
sighed
over
the
fancied
necessity
of
this
;
but
to
a
man
and
a
*NL*
soldier
she
presumed
not
to
censure
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
,
''
said
Colonel
Brandon
,
after
a
pause
,
``
has
been
the
unhappy
*NL*
resemblance
between
the
fate
of
mother
and
daughter
!
and
so
imperfectly
*NL*
have
I
discharged
my
trust
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
still
in
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
as
soon
as
she
recovered
from
her
lying-in
,
for
I
found
her
near
*NL*
her
delivery
,
I
removed
her
and
her
child
into
the
country
,
and
there
*NL*
she
remains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Recollecting
,
soon
afterwards
,
that
he
was
probably
dividing
Elinor
*NL*
from
her
sister
,
he
put
an
end
to
his
visit
,
receiving
from
her
again
*NL*
the
same
grateful
acknowledgments
,
and
leaving
her
full
of
compassion
*NL*
and
esteem
for
him
.

CHAPTER
32
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
particulars
of
this
conversation
were
repeated
by
Miss
*NL*
Dashwood
to
her
sister
,
as
they
very
soon
were
,
the
effect
on
her
was
*NL*
not
entirely
such
as
the
former
had
hoped
to
see
.
Not
that
Marianne
*NL*
appeared
to
distrust
the
truth
of
any
part
of
it
,
for
she
listened
to
*NL*
it
all
with
the
most
steady
and
submissive
attention
,
made
neither
*NL*
objection
nor
remark
,
attempted
no
vindication
of
Willoughby
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
shew
by
her
tears
that
she
felt
it
to
be
impossible
.
But
*NL*
though
this
behaviour
assured
Elinor
that
the
conviction
of
this
guilt
*NL*
WAS
carried
home
to
her
mind
,
though
she
saw
with
satisfaction
the
*NL*
effect
of
it
,
in
her
no
longer
avoiding
Colonel
Brandon
when
he
called
,
*NL*
in
her
speaking
to
him
,
even
voluntarily
speaking
,
with
a
kind
of
*NL*
compassionate
respect
,
and
though
she
saw
her
spirits
less
violently
*NL*
irritated
than
before
,
she
did
not
see
her
less
wretched
.
Her
mind
did
*NL*
become
settled
,
but
it
was
settled
in
a
gloomy
dejection
.
She
felt
the
*NL*
loss
of
Willoughby
's
character
yet
more
heavily
than
she
had
felt
the
*NL*
loss
of
his
heart
;
his
seduction
and
desertion
of
Miss
Williams
,
the
*NL*
misery
of
that
poor
girl
,
and
the
doubt
of
what
his
designs
might
ONCE
*NL*
have
been
on
herself
,
preyed
altogether
so
much
on
her
spirits
,
that
*NL*
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
of
what
she
felt
even
to
Elinor
;
*NL*
and
,
brooding
over
her
sorrows
in
silence
,
gave
more
pain
to
her
sister
*NL*
than
could
have
been
communicated
by
the
most
open
and
most
frequent
*NL*
confession
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
give
the
feelings
or
the
language
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
on
receiving
and
*NL*
answering
Elinor
's
letter
would
be
only
to
give
a
repetition
of
what
*NL*
her
daughters
had
already
felt
and
said
;
of
a
disappointment
hardly
*NL*
less
painful
than
Marianne
's
,
and
an
indignation
even
greater
than
*NL*
Elinor
's
.
Long
letters
from
her
,
quickly
succeeding
each
other
,
*NL*
arrived
to
tell
all
that
she
suffered
and
thought
;
to
express
her
*NL*
anxious
solicitude
for
Marianne
,
and
entreat
she
would
bear
up
with
*NL*
fortitude
under
this
misfortune
.
Bad
indeed
must
the
nature
of
*NL*
Marianne
's
affliction
be
,
when
her
mother
could
talk
of
fortitude
!
*NL*
mortifying
and
humiliating
must
be
the
origin
of
those
regrets
,
which
*NL*
SHE
could
wish
her
not
to
indulge
!
*NL*
*NL*
Against
the
interest
of
her
own
individual
comfort
,
Mrs.
Dashwood
had
*NL*
determined
that
it
would
be
better
for
Marianne
to
be
any
where
,
at
*NL*
that
time
,
than
at
Barton
,
where
every
thing
within
her
view
would
be
*NL*
bringing
back
the
past
in
the
strongest
and
most
afflicting
manner
,
by
*NL*
constantly
placing
Willoughby
before
her
,
such
as
she
had
always
seen
*NL*
him
there
.
She
recommended
it
to
her
daughters
,
therefore
,
by
all
*NL*
means
not
to
shorten
their
visit
to
Mrs.
Jennings
;
the
length
of
which
,
*NL*
though
never
exactly
fixed
,
had
been
expected
by
all
to
comprise
at
*NL*
least
five
or
six
weeks
.
A
variety
of
occupations
,
of
objects
,
and
of
*NL*
company
,
which
could
not
be
procured
at
Barton
,
would
be
inevitable
*NL*
there
,
and
might
yet
,
she
hoped
,
cheat
Marianne
,
at
times
,
into
some
*NL*
interest
beyond
herself
,
and
even
into
some
amusement
,
much
as
the
*NL*
ideas
of
both
might
now
be
spurned
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
all
danger
of
seeing
Willoughby
again
,
her
mother
considered
her
*NL*
to
be
at
least
equally
safe
in
town
as
in
the
country
,
since
his
*NL*
acquaintance
must
now
be
dropped
by
all
who
called
themselves
her
*NL*
friends
.
Design
could
never
bring
them
in
each
other
's
way
:
negligence
*NL*
could
never
leave
them
exposed
to
a
surprise
;
and
chance
had
less
in
*NL*
its
favour
in
the
crowd
of
London
than
even
in
the
retirement
of
*NL*
Barton
,
where
it
might
force
him
before
her
while
paying
that
visit
at
*NL*
Allenham
on
his
marriage
,
which
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
from
foreseeing
at
first
*NL*
as
a
probable
event
,
had
brought
herself
to
expect
as
a
certain
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
yet
another
reason
for
wishing
her
children
to
remain
where
*NL*
they
were
;
a
letter
from
her
son-in-law
had
told
her
that
he
and
his
*NL*
wife
were
to
be
in
town
before
the
middle
of
February
,
and
she
judged
*NL*
it
right
that
they
should
sometimes
see
their
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
had
promised
to
be
guided
by
her
mother
's
opinion
,
and
she
*NL*
submitted
to
it
therefore
without
opposition
,
though
it
proved
*NL*
perfectly
different
from
what
she
wished
and
expected
,
though
she
felt
*NL*
it
to
be
entirely
wrong
,
formed
on
mistaken
grounds
,
and
that
by
*NL*
requiring
her
longer
continuance
in
London
it
deprived
her
of
the
only
*NL*
possible
alleviation
of
her
wretchedness
,
the
personal
sympathy
of
her
*NL*
mother
,
and
doomed
her
to
such
society
and
such
scenes
as
must
prevent
*NL*
her
ever
knowing
a
moment
's
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
a
matter
of
great
consolation
to
her
,
that
what
brought
evil
*NL*
to
herself
would
bring
good
to
her
sister
;
and
Elinor
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
suspecting
that
it
would
not
be
in
her
power
to
avoid
Edward
*NL*
entirely
,
comforted
herself
by
thinking
,
that
though
their
longer
stay
*NL*
would
therefore
militate
against
her
own
happiness
,
it
would
be
better
*NL*
for
Marianne
than
an
immediate
return
into
Devonshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
carefulness
in
guarding
her
sister
from
ever
hearing
Willoughby
's
*NL*
name
mentioned
,
was
not
thrown
away
.
Marianne
,
though
without
knowing
*NL*
it
herself
,
reaped
all
its
advantage
;
for
neither
Mrs.
Jennings
,
nor
*NL*
Sir
John
,
nor
even
Mrs.
Palmer
herself
,
ever
spoke
of
him
before
her
.
*NL*
Elinor
wished
that
the
same
forbearance
could
have
extended
towards
*NL*
herself
,
but
that
was
impossible
,
and
she
was
obliged
to
listen
day
*NL*
after
day
to
the
indignation
of
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
John
,
could
not
have
thought
it
possible
.
``
A
man
of
whom
he
had
*NL*
always
had
such
reason
to
think
well
!
Such
a
good-natured
fellow
!
He
*NL*
did
not
believe
there
was
a
bolder
rider
in
England
!
It
was
an
*NL*
unaccountable
business
.
He
wished
him
at
the
devil
with
all
his
heart
.
*NL*
He
would
not
speak
another
word
to
him
,
meet
him
where
he
might
,
for
*NL*
all
the
world
!
No
,
not
if
it
were
to
be
by
the
side
of
Barton
covert
,
*NL*
and
they
were
kept
watching
for
two
hours
together
.
Such
a
scoundrel
*NL*
of
a
fellow
!
such
a
deceitful
dog
!
It
was
only
the
last
time
they
met
*NL*
that
he
had
offered
him
one
of
Folly
's
puppies
!
and
this
was
the
end
of
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Palmer
,
in
her
way
,
was
equally
angry
.
``
She
was
determined
to
*NL*
drop
his
acquaintance
immediately
,
and
she
was
very
thankful
that
she
*NL*
had
never
been
acquainted
with
him
at
all
.
She
wished
with
all
her
*NL*
heart
Combe
Magna
was
not
so
near
Cleveland
;
but
it
did
not
signify
,
*NL*
for
it
was
a
great
deal
too
far
off
to
visit
;
she
hated
him
so
much
*NL*
that
she
was
resolved
never
to
mention
his
name
again
,
and
she
should
*NL*
tell
everybody
she
saw
,
how
good-for-nothing
he
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
Mrs.
Palmer
's
sympathy
was
shewn
in
procuring
all
the
*NL*
particulars
in
her
power
of
the
approaching
marriage
,
and
communicating
*NL*
them
to
Elinor
.
She
could
soon
tell
at
what
coachmaker
's
the
new
*NL*
carriage
was
building
,
by
what
painter
Mr.
Willoughby
's
portrait
was
*NL*
drawn
,
and
at
what
warehouse
Miss
Grey
's
clothes
might
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
calm
and
polite
unconcern
of
Lady
Middleton
on
the
occasion
was
a
*NL*
happy
relief
to
Elinor
's
spirits
,
oppressed
as
they
often
were
by
the
*NL*
clamorous
kindness
of
the
others
.
It
was
a
great
comfort
to
her
to
be
*NL*
sure
of
exciting
no
interest
in
ONE
person
at
least
among
their
circle
*NL*
of
friends
:
a
great
comfort
to
know
that
there
was
ONE
who
would
meet
*NL*
her
without
feeling
any
curiosity
after
particulars
,
or
any
anxiety
for
*NL*
her
sister
's
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
qualification
is
raised
at
times
,
by
the
circumstances
of
the
*NL*
moment
,
to
more
than
its
real
value
;
and
she
was
sometimes
worried
down
*NL*
by
officious
condolence
to
rate
good-breeding
as
more
indispensable
to
*NL*
comfort
than
good-nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Middleton
expressed
her
sense
of
the
affair
about
once
every
day
,
*NL*
or
twice
,
if
the
subject
occurred
very
often
,
by
saying
,
``
It
is
very
*NL*
shocking
,
indeed
!
''
and
by
the
means
of
this
continual
though
gentle
*NL*
vent
,
was
able
not
only
to
see
the
Miss
Dashwoods
from
the
first
*NL*
without
the
smallest
emotion
,
but
very
soon
to
see
them
without
*NL*
recollecting
a
word
of
the
matter
;
and
having
thus
supported
the
*NL*
dignity
of
her
own
sex
,
and
spoken
her
decided
censure
of
what
was
*NL*
wrong
in
the
other
,
she
thought
herself
at
liberty
to
attend
to
the
*NL*
interest
of
her
own
assemblies
,
and
therefore
determined
-LRB-
though
rather
*NL*
against
the
opinion
of
Sir
John
-RRB-
that
as
Mrs.
Willoughby
would
at
once
*NL*
be
a
woman
of
elegance
and
fortune
,
to
leave
her
card
with
her
as
soon
*NL*
as
she
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
's
delicate
,
unobtrusive
enquiries
were
never
unwelcome
*NL*
to
Miss
Dashwood
.
He
had
abundantly
earned
the
privilege
of
intimate
*NL*
discussion
of
her
sister
's
disappointment
,
by
the
friendly
zeal
with
*NL*
which
he
had
endeavoured
to
soften
it
,
and
they
always
conversed
with
*NL*
confidence
.
His
chief
reward
for
the
painful
exertion
of
disclosing
*NL*
past
sorrows
and
present
humiliations
,
was
given
in
the
pitying
eye
*NL*
with
which
Marianne
sometimes
observed
him
,
and
the
gentleness
of
her
*NL*
voice
whenever
-LRB-
though
it
did
not
often
happen
-RRB-
she
was
obliged
,
or
*NL*
could
oblige
herself
to
speak
to
him
.
THESE
assured
him
that
his
*NL*
exertion
had
produced
an
increase
of
good-will
towards
himself
,
and
*NL*
THESE
gave
Elinor
hopes
of
its
being
farther
augmented
hereafter
;
but
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
,
who
knew
nothing
of
all
this
,
who
knew
only
that
the
*NL*
Colonel
continued
as
grave
as
ever
,
and
that
she
could
neither
prevail
*NL*
on
him
to
make
the
offer
himself
,
nor
commission
her
to
make
it
for
*NL*
him
,
began
,
at
the
end
of
two
days
,
to
think
that
,
instead
of
*NL*
Midsummer
,
they
would
not
be
married
till
Michaelmas
,
and
by
the
end
of
*NL*
a
week
that
it
would
not
be
a
match
at
all
.
The
good
understanding
*NL*
between
the
Colonel
and
Miss
Dashwood
seemed
rather
to
declare
that
the
*NL*
honours
of
the
mulberry-tree
,
the
canal
,
and
the
yew
arbour
,
would
all
*NL*
be
made
over
to
HER
;
and
Mrs.
Jennings
had
,
for
some
time
ceased
to
*NL*
think
at
all
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
February
,
within
a
fortnight
from
the
receipt
of
Willoughby
's
*NL*
letter
,
Elinor
had
the
painful
office
of
informing
her
sister
that
he
*NL*
was
married
.
She
had
taken
care
to
have
the
intelligence
conveyed
to
*NL*
herself
,
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
the
ceremony
was
over
,
as
she
was
*NL*
desirous
that
Marianne
should
not
receive
the
first
notice
of
it
from
*NL*
the
public
papers
,
which
she
saw
her
eagerly
examining
every
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
received
the
news
with
resolute
composure
;
made
no
observation
on
*NL*
it
,
and
at
first
shed
no
tears
;
but
after
a
short
time
they
would
burst
*NL*
out
,
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
,
she
was
in
a
state
hardly
less
*NL*
pitiable
than
when
she
first
learnt
to
expect
the
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Willoughbys
left
town
as
soon
as
they
were
married
;
and
Elinor
now
*NL*
hoped
,
as
there
could
be
no
danger
of
her
seeing
either
of
them
,
to
*NL*
prevail
on
her
sister
,
who
had
never
yet
left
the
house
since
the
blow
*NL*
first
fell
,
to
go
out
again
by
degrees
as
she
had
done
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
the
two
Miss
Steeles
,
lately
arrived
at
their
cousin
's
*NL*
house
in
Bartlett
's
Buildings
,
Holburn
,
presented
themselves
again
*NL*
before
their
more
grand
relations
in
Conduit
and
Berkeley
Streets
;
and
*NL*
were
welcomed
by
them
all
with
great
cordiality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
only
was
sorry
to
see
them
.
Their
presence
always
gave
her
*NL*
pain
,
and
she
hardly
knew
how
to
make
a
very
gracious
return
to
the
*NL*
overpowering
delight
of
Lucy
in
finding
her
STILL
in
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
been
quite
disappointed
if
I
had
not
found
you
here
*NL*
STILL
,
''
said
she
repeatedly
,
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
word
.
``
But
*NL*
I
always
thought
I
SHOULD
.
I
was
almost
sure
you
would
not
leave
*NL*
London
yet
awhile
;
though
you
TOLD
me
,
you
know
,
at
Barton
,
that
you
*NL*
should
not
stay
above
a
MONTH
.
But
I
thought
,
at
the
time
,
that
you
*NL*
would
most
likely
change
your
mind
when
it
came
to
the
point
.
It
would
*NL*
have
been
such
a
great
pity
to
have
went
away
before
your
brother
and
*NL*
sister
came
.
And
now
to
be
sure
you
will
be
in
no
hurry
to
be
gone
.
I
*NL*
am
amazingly
glad
you
did
not
keep
to
YOUR
WORD
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
perfectly
understood
her
,
and
was
forced
to
use
all
her
*NL*
self-command
to
make
it
appear
that
she
did
NOT
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jennings
,
``
and
how
did
you
travel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
stage
,
I
assure
you
,
''
replied
Miss
Steele
,
with
quick
*NL*
exultation
;
``
we
came
post
all
the
way
,
and
had
a
very
smart
beau
to
*NL*
attend
us
.
Dr.
Davies
was
coming
to
town
,
and
so
we
thought
we
'd
join
*NL*
him
in
a
post-chaise
;
and
he
behaved
very
genteelly
,
and
paid
ten
or
*NL*
twelve
shillings
more
than
we
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
oh
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Jennings
;
``
very
pretty
,
indeed
!
and
the
Doctor
is
*NL*
a
single
man
,
I
warrant
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
''
said
Miss
Steele
,
affectedly
simpering
,
``
everybody
laughs
*NL*
at
me
so
about
the
Doctor
,
and
I
can
not
think
why
.
My
cousins
say
they
*NL*
are
sure
I
have
made
a
conquest
;
but
for
my
part
I
declare
I
never
*NL*
think
about
him
from
one
hour
's
end
to
another

`
Lord
!
here
comes
your
*NL*
beau
,
Nancy

my
cousin
said
t

other
day
,
when
she
saw
him
crossing
the
*NL*
street
to
the
house
.
My
beau
,
indeed
!
said
I
--
I
can
not
think
who
you
*NL*
mean
.
The
Doctor
is
no
beau
of
mine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye

that
is
very
pretty
talking

but
it

n't
do

the
man

I
see

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

indeed

replied
her
cousin
,
with
affected
earnestness
,
``

I
beg
*NL*
you
will
contradict
it
,
if
you
ever
hear
it
talked
of

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
directly
gave
her
the
gratifying
assurance
that
she
*NL*
certainly
would
NOT
,
and
Miss
Steele
was
made
completely
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
will
go
and
stay
with
your
brother

sister
,
Miss

Dashwood

when
they
come
to
town

said
Lucy
,
returning
,
after
a
*NL*
cessation
of
hostile
hints
,
to
the
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
do
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

I
dare
say
you

*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
would
not
humour
her
by
farther
opposition

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
charming

it

*NL*
``
Long

interposed
Mrs.
Jennings
.
``
Why

visit

just
begun

*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
silenced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry

Miss

''
for
Marianne
had
left
the
room
*NL*
on
their
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
good
.
My
sister
will
be
equally
sorry
to
miss
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
seeing
you
;
but
she
has
been
very
much
plagued
lately
with
*NL*
nervous
head-aches
,
which
make
her
unfit
for
company
or
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
that
is
a
great
pity
!
but
such
old
friends
as
Lucy
and
*NL*
me
!

I
think
she
might
see
US
;
and
I
am
sure
we
would
not
speak
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
with
great
civility
,
declined
the
proposal
.
Her
sister
was
*NL*
perhaps
laid
down
upon
the
bed
,
or
in
her
dressing
gown
,
and
therefore
*NL*
not
able
to
come
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
that
's
all

cried
Miss
Steele
,
``
we
can
just
as
well
go
and
see
*NL*
HER
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
began
to
find
this
impertinence
too
much
for
her
temper
;
but
she
*NL*
was
saved
the
trouble
of
checking
it
,
by
Lucy
's
sharp
reprimand
,
which
*NL*
now
,
as
on
many
occasions
,
though
it
did
not
give
much
sweetness
to
the
*NL*
manners
of
one
sister
,
was
of
advantage
in
governing
those
of
the
other

CHAPTER
33
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
opposition
,
Marianne
yielded
to
her
sister
's
entreaties
,
and
*NL*
consented
to
go
out
with
her
and
Mrs.
Jennings
one
morning
for
half
an
*NL*
hour
.
She
expressly
conditioned
,
however
,
for
paying
no
visits
,
and
*NL*
would
do
no
more
than
accompany
them
to
Gray
's
in
Sackville
Street
,
*NL*
where
Elinor
was
carrying
on
a
negotiation
for
the
exchange
of
a
few
*NL*
old-fashioned
jewels
of
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
stopped
at
the
door
,
Mrs.
Jennings
recollected
that
there
was
*NL*
a
lady
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
on
whom
she
ought
to
call
;
and
as
*NL*
she
had
no
business
at
Gray
's
,
it
was
resolved
,
that
while
her
young
*NL*
friends
transacted
their
's
,
she
should
pay
her
visit
and
return
for
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
ascending
the
stairs
,
the
Miss
Dashwoods
found
so
many
people
before
*NL*
them
in
the
room
,
that
there
was
not
a
person
at
liberty
to
tend
to
*NL*
their
orders
;
and
they
were
obliged
to
wait
.
All
that
could
be
done
*NL*
was
,
to
sit
down
at
that
end
of
the
counter
which
seemed
to
promise
the
*NL*
quickest
succession
;
one
gentleman
only
was
standing
there
,
and
it
is
*NL*
probable
that
Elinor
was
not
without
hope
of
exciting
his
politeness
to
*NL*
a
quicker
despatch
.
But
the
correctness
of
his
eye
,
and
the
delicacy
*NL*
of
his
taste
,
proved
to
be
beyond
his
politeness
.
He
was
giving
orders
*NL*
for
a
toothpick-case
for
himself
,
and
till
its
size
,
shape
,
and
*NL*
ornaments
were
determined
,
all
of
which
,
after
examining
and
debating
*NL*
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
over
every
toothpick-case
in
the
shop
,
were
*NL*
finally
arranged
by
his
own
inventive
fancy
,
he
had
no
leisure
to
*NL*
bestow
any
other
attention
on
the
two
ladies
,
than
what
was
comprised
*NL*
in
three
or
four
very
broad
stares
;
a
kind
of
notice
which
served
to
*NL*
imprint
on
Elinor
the
remembrance
of
a
person
and
face
,
of
strong
,
*NL*
natural
,
sterling
insignificance
,
though
adorned
in
the
first
style
of
*NL*
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
was
spared
from
the
troublesome
feelings
of
contempt
and
*NL*
resentment
,
on
this
impertinent
examination
of
their
features
,
and
on
*NL*
the
puppyism
of
his
manner
in
deciding
on
all
the
different
horrors
of
*NL*
the
different
toothpick-cases
presented
to
his
inspection
,
by
remaining
*NL*
unconscious
of
it
all
;
for
she
was
as
well
able
to
collect
her
thoughts
*NL*
within
herself
,
and
be
as
ignorant
of
what
was
passing
around
her
,
in
*NL*
Mr.
Gray
's
shop
,
as
in
her
own
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
affair
was
decided
.
The
ivory
,
the
gold
,
and
the
pearls
,
*NL*
all
received
their
appointment
,
and
the
gentleman
having
named
the
last
*NL*
day
on
which
his
existence
could
be
continued
without
the
possession
of
*NL*
the
toothpick-case
,
drew
on
his
gloves
with
leisurely
care
,
and
*NL*
bestowing
another
glance
on
the
Miss
Dashwoods
,
but
such
a
one
as
*NL*
seemed
rather
to
demand
than
express
admiration
,
walked
off
with
a
*NL*
happy
air
of
real
conceit
and
affected
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
lost
no
time
in
bringing
her
business
forward
,
was
on
the
point
*NL*
of
concluding
it
,
when
another
gentleman
presented
himself
at
her
side
.
*NL*
She
turned
her
eyes
towards
his
face
,
and
found
him
with
some
surprise
*NL*
to
be
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
affection
and
pleasure
in
meeting
was
just
enough
to
make
a
very
*NL*
creditable
appearance
in
Mr.
Gray
's
shop
.
John
Dashwood
was
really
far
*NL*
from
being
sorry
to
see
his
sisters
again
;
it
rather
gave
them
*NL*
satisfaction
;
and
his
inquiries
after
their
mother
were
respectful
and
*NL*
attentive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
found
that
he
and
Fanny
had
been
in
town
two
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wished
very
much
to
call
upon
you
yesterday
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
it
was
*NL*
impossible
,
for
we
were
obliged
to
take
Harry
to
see
the
wild
beasts
at
*NL*
Exeter
Exchange
;
and
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
with
Mrs.
Ferrars
.
*NL*
Harry
was
vastly
pleased
.
THIS
morning
I
had
fully
intended
to
call
on
*NL*
you
,
if
I
could
possibly
find
a
spare
half
hour
,
but
one
has
always
so
*NL*
much
to
do
on
first
coming
to
town
.
I
am
come
here
to
bespeak
Fanny
a
*NL*
seal
.
But
tomorrow
I
think
I
shall
certainly
be
able
to
call
in
*NL*
Berkeley
Street
,
and
be
introduced
to
your
friend
Mrs.
Jennings
.
I
*NL*
understand
she
is
a
woman
of
very
good
fortune
.
And
the
Middletons
*NL*
too
,
you
must
introduce
me
to
THEM
.
As
my
mother-in-law
's
relations
,
I
*NL*
shall
be
happy
to
show
them
every
respect
.
They
are
excellent
*NL*
neighbours
to
you
in
the
country
,
I
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
indeed
.
Their
attention
to
our
comfort
,
their
friendliness
*NL*
in
every
particular
,
is
more
than
I
can
express
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
extremely
glad
to
hear
it
,
upon
my
word
;
extremely
glad
indeed
.
*NL*
But
so
it
ought
to
be
;
they
are
people
of
large
fortune
,
they
are
*NL*
related
to
you
,
and
every
civility
and
accommodation
that
can
serve
to
*NL*
make
your
situation
pleasant
might
be
reasonably
expected
.
And
so
you
*NL*
are
most
comfortably
settled
in
your
little
cottage
and
want
for
*NL*
nothing
!
Edward
brought
us
a
most
charming
account
of
the
place
:
the
*NL*
most
complete
thing
of
its
kind
,
he
said
,
that
ever
was
,
and
you
all
*NL*
seemed
to
enjoy
it
beyond
any
thing
.
It
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
us
*NL*
to
hear
it
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
did
feel
a
little
ashamed
of
her
brother
;
and
was
not
sorry
to
*NL*
be
spared
the
necessity
of
answering
him
,
by
the
arrival
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
's
servant
,
who
came
to
tell
her
that
his
mistress
waited
for
*NL*
them
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dashwood
attended
them
down
stairs
,
was
introduced
to
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
at
the
door
of
her
carriage
,
and
repeating
his
hope
of
being
able
to
*NL*
call
on
them
the
next
day
,
took
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
visit
was
duly
paid
.
He
came
with
a
pretence
at
an
apology
from
*NL*
their
sister-in-law
,
for
not
coming
too
;
``
but
she
was
so
much
engaged
*NL*
with
her
mother
,
that
really
she
had
no
leisure
for
going
any
where
.
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
,
however
,
assured
him
directly
,
that
she
should
not
stand
*NL*
upon
ceremony
,
for
they
were
all
cousins
,
or
something
like
it
,
and
she
*NL*
should
certainly
wait
on
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
very
soon
,
and
bring
her
*NL*
sisters
to
see
her
.
His
manners
to
THEM
,
though
calm
,
were
perfectly
*NL*
kind
;
to
Mrs.
Jennings
,
most
attentively
civil
;
and
on
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
's
coming
in
soon
after
himself
,
he
eyed
him
with
a
curiosity
*NL*
which
seemed
to
say
,
that
he
only
wanted
to
know
him
to
be
rich
,
to
be
*NL*
equally
civil
to
HIM
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
staying
with
them
half
an
hour
,
he
asked
Elinor
to
walk
with
him
*NL*
to
Conduit
Street
,
and
introduce
him
to
Sir
John
and
Lady
Middleton
.
*NL*
The
weather
was
remarkably
fine
,
and
she
readily
consented
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
they
were
out
of
the
house
,
his
enquiries
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
Colonel
Brandon
?
Is
he
a
man
of
fortune
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
has
very
good
property
in
Dorsetshire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
it
.
He
seems
a
most
gentlemanlike
man
;
and
I
think
,
*NL*
Elinor
,
I
may
congratulate
you
on
the
prospect
of
a
very
respectable
*NL*
establishment
in
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
,
brother
!
what
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
likes
you
.
I
observed
him
narrowly
,
and
am
convinced
of
it
.
What
*NL*
is
the
amount
of
his
fortune
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
about
two
thousand
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
thousand
a-year
;
''
and
then
working
himself
up
to
a
pitch
of
*NL*
enthusiastic
generosity
,
he
added
,
``
Elinor
,
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
it
*NL*
were
TWICE
as
much
,
for
your
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
believe
you
,
''
replied
Elinor
;
``
but
I
am
very
sure
that
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
has
not
the
smallest
wish
of
marrying
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
Elinor
;
you
are
very
much
mistaken
.
A
very
little
*NL*
trouble
on
your
side
secures
him
.
Perhaps
just
at
present
he
may
be
*NL*
undecided
;
the
smallness
of
your
fortune
may
make
him
hang
back
;
his
*NL*
friends
may
all
advise
him
against
it
.
But
some
of
those
little
*NL*
attentions
and
encouragements
which
ladies
can
so
easily
give
will
fix
*NL*
him
,
in
spite
of
himself
.
And
there
can
be
no
reason
why
you
should
*NL*
not
try
for
him
.
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
prior
attachment
on
*NL*
your
side
--
in
short
,
you
know
as
to
an
attachment
of
that
kind
,
it
is
*NL*
quite
out
of
the
question
,
the
objections
are
insurmountable
--
you
have
*NL*
too
much
sense
not
to
see
all
that
.
Colonel
Brandon
must
be
the
man
;
*NL*
and
no
civility
shall
be
wanting
on
my
part
to
make
him
pleased
with
*NL*
you
and
your
family
.
It
is
a
match
that
must
give
universal
*NL*
satisfaction
.
In
short
,
it
is
a
kind
of
thing
that
''
--
lowering
his
*NL*
voice
to
an
important
whisper
--
``
will
be
exceedingly
welcome
to
ALL
*NL*
PARTIES
.
''
Recollecting
himself
,
however
,
he
added
,
``
That
is
,
I
mean
to
*NL*
say
--
your
friends
are
all
truly
anxious
to
see
you
well
settled

Fanny
*NL*
particularly
,
for
she
has
your
interest
very
much
at
heart
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
.
And
her
mother
too
,
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
a
very
good-natured
woman
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
it
would
give
her
great
pleasure
;
she
said
as
much
the
other
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
would
not
vouchsafe
any
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
something
remarkable
,
now
,
''
he
continued
,
``
something
*NL*
droll
,
if
Fanny
should
have
a
brother
and
I
a
sister
settling
at
the
*NL*
same
time
.
And
yet
it
is
not
very
unlikely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Edward
Ferrars
,
''
said
Elinor
,
with
resolution
,
``
going
to
be
*NL*
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
actually
settled
,
but
there
is
such
a
thing
in
agitation
.
*NL*
He
has
a
most
excellent
mother
.
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
with
the
utmost
*NL*
liberality
,
will
come
forward
,
and
settle
on
him
a
thousand
a
year
,
if
*NL*
the
match
takes
place
.
The
lady
is
the
Hon.
Miss
Morton
,
only
daughter
*NL*
of
the
late
Lord
Morton
,
with
thirty
thousand
pounds
.
A
very
desirable
*NL*
connection
on
both
sides
,
and
I
have
not
a
doubt
of
its
taking
place
in
*NL*
time
.
A
thousand
a-year
is
a
great
deal
for
a
mother
to
give
away
,
to
*NL*
make
over
for
ever
;
but
Mrs.
Ferrars
has
a
noble
spirit
.
To
give
you
*NL*
another
instance
of
her
liberality
:
--
The
other
day
,
as
soon
as
we
came
*NL*
to
town
,
aware
that
money
could
not
be
very
plenty
with
us
just
now
,
*NL*
she
put
bank-notes
into
Fanny
's
hands
to
the
amount
of
two
hundred
*NL*
pounds
.
And
extremely
acceptable
it
is
,
for
we
must
live
at
a
great
*NL*
expense
while
we
are
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
for
her
assent
and
compassion
;
and
she
forced
herself
to
say
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
expenses
both
in
town
and
country
must
certainly
be
considerable
;
*NL*
but
your
income
is
a
large
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
large
,
I
dare
say
,
as
many
people
suppose
.
I
do
not
mean
to
*NL*
complain
,
however
;
it
is
undoubtedly
a
comfortable
one
,
and
I
hope
will
*NL*
in
time
be
better
.
The
enclosure
of
Norland
Common
,
now
carrying
on
,
*NL*
is
a
most
serious
drain
.
And
then
I
have
made
a
little
purchase
within
*NL*
this
half
year
;
East
Kingham
Farm
,
you
must
remember
the
place
,
where
*NL*
old
Gibson
used
to
live
.
The
land
was
so
very
desirable
for
me
in
*NL*
every
respect
,
so
immediately
adjoining
my
own
property
,
that
I
felt
it
*NL*
my
duty
to
buy
it
.
I
could
not
have
answered
it
to
my
conscience
to
*NL*
let
it
fall
into
any
other
hands
.
A
man
must
pay
for
his
convenience
;
*NL*
and
it
HAS
cost
me
a
vast
deal
of
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
you
think
it
really
and
intrinsically
worth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
hope
not
that
.
I
might
have
sold
it
again
,
the
next
day
,
for
*NL*
more
than
I
gave
:
but
,
with
regard
to
the
purchase-money
,
I
might
have
*NL*
been
very
unfortunate
indeed
;
for
the
stocks
were
at
that
time
so
low
,
*NL*
that
if
I
had
not
happened
to
have
the
necessary
sum
in
my
banker
's
*NL*
hands
,
I
must
have
sold
out
to
very
great
loss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
only
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Other
great
and
inevitable
expenses
too
we
have
had
on
first
coming
to
*NL*
Norland
.
Our
respected
father
,
as
you
well
know
,
bequeathed
all
the
*NL*
Stanhill
effects
that
remained
at
Norland
-LRB-
and
very
valuable
they
were
-RRB-
*NL*
to
your
mother
.
Far
be
it
from
me
to
repine
at
his
doing
so
;
he
had
an
*NL*
undoubted
right
to
dispose
of
his
own
property
as
he
chose
,
but
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
it
,
we
have
been
obliged
to
make
large
purchases
of
*NL*
linen
,
china
,
&
c.
to
supply
the
place
of
what
was
taken
away
.
You
may
*NL*
guess
,
after
all
these
expenses
,
how
very
far
we
must
be
from
being
*NL*
rich
,
and
how
acceptable
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
kindness
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Elinor
;
``
and
assisted
by
her
liberality
,
I
hope
you
*NL*
may
yet
live
to
be
in
easy
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
year
or
two
may
do
much
towards
it
,
''
he
gravely
replied
;
``
but
*NL*
however
there
is
still
a
great
deal
to
be
done
.
There
is
not
a
stone
*NL*
laid
of
Fanny
's
green-house
,
and
nothing
but
the
plan
of
the
*NL*
flower-garden
marked
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
green-house
to
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
the
knoll
behind
the
house
.
The
old
walnut
trees
are
all
come
*NL*
down
to
make
room
for
it
.
It
will
be
a
very
fine
object
from
many
*NL*
parts
of
the
park
,
and
the
flower-garden
will
slope
down
just
before
*NL*
it
,
and
be
exceedingly
pretty
.
We
have
cleared
away
all
the
old
thorns
*NL*
that
grew
in
patches
over
the
brow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
kept
her
concern
and
her
censure
to
herself
;
and
was
very
*NL*
thankful
that
Marianne
was
not
present
,
to
share
the
provocation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
now
said
enough
to
make
his
poverty
clear
,
and
to
do
away
the
*NL*
necessity
of
buying
a
pair
of
ear-rings
for
each
of
his
sisters
,
in
his
*NL*
next
visit
at
Gray
's
his
thoughts
took
a
cheerfuller
turn
,
and
he
began
*NL*
to
congratulate
Elinor
on
having
such
a
friend
as
Mrs.
Jennings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
seems
a
most
valuable
woman
indeed
--
Her
house
,
her
style
of
*NL*
living
,
all
bespeak
an
exceeding
good
income
;
and
it
is
an
acquaintance
*NL*
that
has
not
only
been
of
great
use
to
you
hitherto
,
but
in
the
end
may
*NL*
prove
materially
advantageous
.
--
Her
inviting
you
to
town
is
certainly
a
*NL*
vast
thing
in
your
favour
;
and
indeed
,
it
speaks
altogether
so
great
a
*NL*
regard
for
you
,
that
in
all
probability
when
she
dies
you
will
not
be
*NL*
forgotten
.
--
She
must
have
a
great
deal
to
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
at
all
,
I
should
rather
suppose
;
for
she
has
only
her
*NL*
jointure
,
which
will
descend
to
her
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
that
she
lives
up
to
her
income
.
Few
*NL*
people
of
common
prudence
will
do
THAT
;
and
whatever
she
saves
,
she
*NL*
will
be
able
to
dispose
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
not
think
it
more
likely
that
she
should
leave
it
to
her
*NL*
daughters
,
than
to
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
daughters
are
both
exceedingly
well
married
,
and
therefore
I
*NL*
can
not
perceive
the
necessity
of
her
remembering
them
farther
.
*NL*
Whereas
,
in
my
opinion
,
by
her
taking
so
much
notice
of
you
,
and
*NL*
treating
you
in
this
kind
of
way
,
she
has
given
you
a
sort
of
claim
on
*NL*
her
future
consideration
,
which
a
conscientious
woman
would
not
*NL*
disregard
.
Nothing
can
be
kinder
than
her
behaviour
;
and
she
can
*NL*
hardly
do
all
this
,
without
being
aware
of
the
expectation
it
raises
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
raises
none
in
those
most
concerned

Indeed
,
brother
,
your
*NL*
anxiety
for
our
welfare
and
prosperity
carries
you
too
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
he
,
seeming
to
recollect
himself
,
``
people
have
*NL*
little
,
have
very
little
in
their
power
.
But
,
my
dear
Elinor
,
what
is
*NL*
the
matter
with
Marianne
?
--
she
looks
very
unwell
,
has
lost
her
colour
,
*NL*
and
is
grown
quite
thin
.
Is
she
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
not
well
,
she
has
had
a
nervous
complaint
on
her
for
several
*NL*
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
that
.
At
her
time
of
life
,
any
thing
of
an
illness
*NL*
destroys
the
bloom
for
ever
!
Hers
has
been
a
very
short
one
!
She
was
*NL*
as
handsome
a
girl
last
September
,
as
I
ever
saw
;
and
as
likely
to
*NL*
attract
the
man
.
There
was
something
in
her
style
of
beauty
,
to
please
*NL*
them
particularly
.
I
remember
Fanny
used
to
say
that
she
would
marry
*NL*
sooner
and
better
than
you
did
;
not
but
what
she
is
exceedingly
fond
of
*NL*
YOU
,
but
so
it
happened
to
strike
her
.
She
will
be
mistaken
,
however
.
*NL*
I
question
whether
Marianne
NOW
,
will
marry
a
man
worth
more
than
five
*NL*
or
six
hundred
a-year
,
at
the
utmost
,

I
am
very
much
deceived
if
*NL*
YOU
do
not
do
better
.
Dorsetshire
!
I
know
very
little
of
Dorsetshire
;
*NL*
but
,
my
dear
Elinor
,
I
shall
be
exceedingly
glad
to
know
more
of
it
;
*NL*
and
I
think
I
can
answer
for
your
having
Fanny
and
myself
among
the
*NL*
earliest
and
best
pleased
of
your
visitors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
tried
very
seriously
to
convince
him
that
there
was
no
*NL*
likelihood
of
her
marrying
Colonel
Brandon
;
but
it
was
an
expectation
*NL*
of
too
much
pleasure
to
himself
to
be
relinquished
,
and
he
was
really
*NL*
resolved
on
seeking
an
intimacy
with
that
gentleman
,
and
promoting
the
*NL*
marriage
by
every
possible
attention
.
He
had
just
compunction
enough
*NL*
for
having
done
nothing
for
his
sisters
himself
,
to
be
exceedingly
*NL*
anxious
that
everybody
else
should
do
a
great
deal
;
and
an
offer
from
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
,
or
a
legacy
from
Mrs.
Jennings
,
was
the
easiest
means
*NL*
of
atoning
for
his
own
neglect
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
lucky
enough
to
find
Lady
Middleton
at
home
,
and
Sir
John
*NL*
came
in
before
their
visit
ended
.
Abundance
of
civilities
passed
on
*NL*
all
sides
.
Sir
John
was
ready
to
like
anybody
,
and
though
Mr.
Dashwood
*NL*
did
not
seem
to
know
much
about
horses
,
he
soon
set
him
down
as
a
very
*NL*
good-natured
fellow
:
while
Lady
Middleton
saw
enough
of
fashion
in
his
*NL*
appearance
to
think
his
acquaintance
worth
having
;
and
Mr.
Dashwood
*NL*
went
away
delighted
with
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
a
charming
account
to
carry
to
Fanny
,
''
said
he
,
as
he
*NL*
walked
back
with
his
sister
.
``
Lady
Middleton
is
really
a
most
elegant
*NL*
woman
!
Such
a
woman
as
I
am
sure
Fanny
will
be
glad
to
know
.
And
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
too
,
an
exceedingly
well-behaved
woman
,
though
not
so
elegant
*NL*
as
her
daughter
.
Your
sister
need
not
have
any
scruple
even
of
*NL*
visiting
HER
,
which
,
to
say
the
truth
,
has
been
a
little
the
case
,
and
*NL*
very
naturally
;
for
we
only
knew
that
Mrs.
Jennings
was
the
widow
of
a
*NL*
man
who
had
got
all
his
money
in
a
low
way
;
and
Fanny
and
Mrs.
Ferrars
*NL*
were
both
strongly
prepossessed
,
that
neither
she
nor
her
daughters
*NL*
were
such
kind
of
women
as
Fanny
would
like
to
associate
with
.
But
now
*NL*
I
can
carry
her
a
most
satisfactory
account
of
both

CHAPTER
34
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
had
so
much
confidence
in
her
husband
's
judgment
,
*NL*
that
she
waited
the
very
next
day
both
on
Mrs.
Jennings
and
her
*NL*
daughter
;
and
her
confidence
was
rewarded
by
finding
even
the
former
,
*NL*
even
the
woman
with
whom
her
sisters
were
staying
,
by
no
means
unworthy
*NL*
her
notice
;
and
as
for
Lady
Middleton
,
she
found
her
one
of
the
most
*NL*
charming
women
in
the
world
!
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Middleton
was
equally
pleased
with
Mrs.
Dashwood
.
There
was
a
*NL*
kind
of
cold
hearted
selfishness
on
both
sides
,
which
mutually
*NL*
attracted
them
;
and
they
sympathised
with
each
other
in
an
insipid
*NL*
propriety
of
demeanor
,
and
a
general
want
of
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
manners
,
however
,
which
recommended
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
to
the
*NL*
good
opinion
of
Lady
Middleton
did
not
suit
the
fancy
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
*NL*
and
to
HER
she
appeared
nothing
more
than
a
little
proud-looking
woman
*NL*
of
uncordial
address
,
who
met
her
husband
's
sisters
without
any
*NL*
affection
,
and
almost
without
having
anything
to
say
to
them
;
for
of
*NL*
the
quarter
of
an
hour
bestowed
on
Berkeley
Street
,
she
sat
at
least
*NL*
seven
minutes
and
a
half
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
wanted
very
much
to
know
,
though
she
did
not
chuse
to
ask
,
*NL*
whether
Edward
was
then
in
town
;
but
nothing
would
have
induced
Fanny
*NL*
voluntarily
to
mention
his
name
before
her
,
till
able
to
tell
her
that
*NL*
his
marriage
with
Miss
Morton
was
resolved
on
,
or
till
her
husband
's
*NL*
expectations
on
Colonel
Brandon
were
answered
;
because
she
believed
*NL*
them
still
so
very
much
attached
to
each
other
,
that
they
could
not
be
*NL*
too
sedulously
divided
in
word
and
deed
on
every
occasion
.
The
*NL*
intelligence
however
,
which
SHE
would
not
give
,
soon
flowed
from
*NL*
another
quarter
.
Lucy
came
very
shortly
to
claim
Elinor
's
compassion
*NL*
on
being
unable
to
see
Edward
,
though
he
had
arrived
in
town
with
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
.
He
dared
not
come
to
Bartlett
's
Buildings
for
fear
*NL*
of
detection
,
and
though
their
mutual
impatience
to
meet
,
was
not
to
be
*NL*
told
,
they
could
do
nothing
at
present
but
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
assured
them
himself
of
his
being
in
town
,
within
a
very
short
*NL*
time
,
by
twice
calling
in
Berkeley
Street
.
Twice
was
his
card
found
on
*NL*
the
table
,
when
they
returned
from
their
morning
's
engagements
.
Elinor
*NL*
was
pleased
that
he
had
called
;
and
still
more
pleased
that
she
had
*NL*
missed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dashwoods
were
so
prodigiously
delighted
with
the
Middletons
,
that
,
*NL*
though
not
much
in
the
habit
of
giving
anything
,
they
determined
to
*NL*
give
them
--
a
dinner
;
and
soon
after
their
acquaintance
began
,
invited
*NL*
them
to
dine
in
Harley
Street
,
where
they
had
taken
a
very
good
house
*NL*
for
three
months
.
Their
sisters
and
Mrs.
Jennings
were
invited
*NL*
likewise
,
and
John
Dashwood
was
careful
to
secure
Colonel
Brandon
,
who
,
*NL*
always
glad
to
be
where
the
Miss
Dashwoods
were
,
received
his
eager
*NL*
civilities
with
some
surprise
,
but
much
more
pleasure
.
They
were
to
*NL*
meet
Mrs.
Ferrars
;
but
Elinor
could
not
learn
whether
her
sons
were
to
*NL*
be
of
the
party
.
The
expectation
of
seeing
HER
,
however
,
was
enough
to
*NL*
make
her
interested
in
the
engagement
;
for
though
she
could
now
meet
*NL*
Edward
's
mother
without
that
strong
anxiety
which
had
once
promised
to
*NL*
attend
such
an
introduction
,
though
she
could
now
see
her
with
perfect
*NL*
indifference
as
to
her
opinion
of
herself
,
her
desire
of
being
in
*NL*
company
with
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
her
curiosity
to
know
what
she
was
like
,
was
*NL*
as
lively
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interest
with
which
she
thus
anticipated
the
party
,
was
soon
*NL*
afterwards
increased
,
more
powerfully
than
pleasantly
,
by
her
hearing
*NL*
that
the
Miss
Steeles
were
also
to
be
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
well
had
they
recommended
themselves
to
Lady
Middleton
,
so
agreeable
*NL*
had
their
assiduities
made
them
to
her
,
that
though
Lucy
was
certainly
*NL*
not
so
elegant
,
and
her
sister
not
even
genteel
,
she
was
as
ready
as
*NL*
Sir
John
to
ask
them
to
spend
a
week
or
two
in
Conduit
Street
;
and
it
*NL*
happened
to
be
particularly
convenient
to
the
Miss
Steeles
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
Dashwoods
'
invitation
was
known
,
that
their
visit
should
begin
a
*NL*
few
days
before
the
party
took
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
claims
to
the
notice
of
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
,
as
the
nieces
of
the
*NL*
gentleman
who
for
many
years
had
had
the
care
of
her
brother
,
might
not
*NL*
have
done
much
,
however
,
towards
procuring
them
seats
at
her
table
;
but
*NL*
as
Lady
Middleton
's
guests
they
must
be
welcome
;
and
Lucy
,
who
had
long
*NL*
wanted
to
be
personally
known
to
the
family
,
to
have
a
nearer
view
of
*NL*
their
characters
and
her
own
difficulties
,
and
to
have
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
endeavouring
to
please
them
,
had
seldom
been
happier
in
her
life
,
*NL*
than
she
was
on
receiving
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
's
card
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Elinor
its
effect
was
very
different
.
She
began
immediately
to
*NL*
determine
,
that
Edward
who
lived
with
his
mother
,
must
be
asked
as
his
*NL*
mother
was
,
to
a
party
given
by
his
sister
;
and
to
see
him
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
after
all
that
passed
,
in
the
company
of
Lucy
!
--
she
hardly
*NL*
knew
how
she
could
bear
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
These
apprehensions
,
perhaps
,
were
not
founded
entirely
on
reason
,
and
*NL*
certainly
not
at
all
on
truth
.
They
were
relieved
however
,
not
by
her
*NL*
own
recollection
,
but
by
the
good
will
of
Lucy
,
who
believed
herself
to
*NL*
be
inflicting
a
severe
disappointment
when
she
told
her
that
Edward
*NL*
certainly
would
not
be
in
Harley
Street
on
Tuesday
,
and
even
hoped
to
*NL*
be
carrying
the
pain
still
farther
by
persuading
her
that
he
was
kept
*NL*
away
by
the
extreme
affection
for
herself
,
which
he
could
not
conceal
*NL*
when
they
were
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
important
Tuesday
came
that
was
to
introduce
the
two
young
ladies
*NL*
to
this
formidable
mother-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pity
me
,
dear
Miss
Dashwood
!
''
said
Lucy
,
as
they
walked
up
the
stairs
*NL*
together
--
for
the
Middletons
arrived
so
directly
after
Mrs.
Jennings
,
*NL*
that
they
all
followed
the
servant
at
the
same
time
--
``
There
is
nobody
*NL*
here
but
you
,
that
can
feel
for
me
.
--
I
declare
I
can
hardly
stand
.
*NL*
Good
gracious
!
--
In
a
moment
I
shall
see
the
person
that
all
my
*NL*
happiness
depends
on
--
that
is
to
be
my
mother
!
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
have
given
her
immediate
relief
by
suggesting
the
*NL*
possibility
of
its
being
Miss
Morton
's
mother
,
rather
than
her
own
,
*NL*
whom
they
were
about
to
behold
;
but
instead
of
doing
that
,
she
assured
*NL*
her
,
and
with
great
sincerity
,
that
she
did
pity
her
--
to
the
utter
*NL*
amazement
of
Lucy
,
who
,
though
really
uncomfortable
herself
,
hoped
at
*NL*
least
to
be
an
object
of
irrepressible
envy
to
Elinor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Ferrars
was
a
little
,
thin
woman
,
upright
,
even
to
formality
,
in
*NL*
her
figure
,
and
serious
,
even
to
sourness
,
in
her
aspect
.
Her
*NL*
complexion
was
sallow
;
and
her
features
small
,
without
beauty
,
and
*NL*
naturally
without
expression
;
but
a
lucky
contraction
of
the
brow
had
*NL*
rescued
her
countenance
from
the
disgrace
of
insipidity
,
by
giving
it
*NL*
the
strong
characters
of
pride
and
ill
nature
.
She
was
not
a
woman
of
*NL*
many
words
;
for
,
unlike
people
in
general
,
she
proportioned
them
to
the
*NL*
number
of
her
ideas
;
and
of
the
few
syllables
that
did
escape
her
,
not
*NL*
one
fell
to
the
share
of
Miss
Dashwood
,
whom
she
eyed
with
the
spirited
*NL*
determination
of
disliking
her
at
all
events
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
not
NOW
be
made
unhappy
by
this
behaviour
.
--
A
few
months
*NL*
ago
it
would
have
hurt
her
exceedingly
;
but
it
was
not
in
Mrs.
Ferrars
'
*NL*
power
to
distress
her
by
it
now
;
--
and
the
difference
of
her
manners
to
*NL*
the
Miss
Steeles
,
a
difference
which
seemed
purposely
made
to
humble
*NL*
her
more
,
only
amused
her
.
She
could
not
but
smile
to
see
the
*NL*
graciousness
of
both
mother
and
daughter
towards
the
very
person
--
for
*NL*
Lucy
was
particularly
distinguished
--
whom
of
all
others
,
had
they
known
*NL*
as
much
as
she
did
,
they
would
have
been
most
anxious
to
mortify
;
while
*NL*
she
herself
,
who
had
comparatively
no
power
to
wound
them
,
sat
*NL*
pointedly
slighted
by
both
.
But
while
she
smiled
at
a
graciousness
so
*NL*
misapplied
,
she
could
not
reflect
on
the
mean-spirited
folly
from
which
*NL*
it
sprung
,
nor
observe
the
studied
attentions
with
which
the
Miss
*NL*
Steeles
courted
its
continuance
,
without
thoroughly
despising
them
all
*NL*
four
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
was
all
exultation
on
being
so
honorably
distinguished
;
and
Miss
*NL*
Steele
wanted
only
to
be
teazed
about
Dr.
Davies
to
be
perfectly
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
a
grand
one
,
the
servants
were
numerous
,
and
every
thing
*NL*
bespoke
the
Mistress
's
inclination
for
show
,
and
the
Master
's
ability
*NL*
to
support
it
.
In
spite
of
the
improvements
and
additions
which
were
*NL*
making
to
the
Norland
estate
,
and
in
spite
of
its
owner
having
once
*NL*
been
within
some
thousand
pounds
of
being
obliged
to
sell
out
at
a
*NL*
loss
,
nothing
gave
any
symptom
of
that
indigence
which
he
had
tried
to
*NL*
infer
from
it
;
--
no
poverty
of
any
kind
,
except
of
conversation
,
*NL*
appeared
--
but
there
,
the
deficiency
was
considerable
.
John
Dashwood
*NL*
had
not
much
to
say
for
himself
that
was
worth
hearing
,
and
his
wife
*NL*
had
still
less
.
But
there
was
no
peculiar
disgrace
in
this
;
for
it
was
*NL*
very
much
the
case
with
the
chief
of
their
visitors
,
who
almost
all
*NL*
laboured
under
one
or
other
of
these
disqualifications
for
being
*NL*
agreeable
--
Want
of
sense
,
either
natural
or
improved
--
want
of
*NL*
elegance
--
want
of
spirits
--
or
want
of
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
ladies
withdrew
to
the
drawing-room
after
dinner
,
this
poverty
*NL*
was
particularly
evident
,
for
the
gentlemen
HAD
supplied
the
discourse
*NL*
with
some
variety
--
the
variety
of
politics
,
inclosing
land
,
and
*NL*
breaking
horses
--
but
then
it
was
all
over
;
and
one
subject
only
engaged
*NL*
the
ladies
till
coffee
came
in
,
which
was
the
comparative
heights
of
*NL*
Harry
Dashwood
,
and
Lady
Middleton
's
second
son
William
,
who
were
*NL*
nearly
of
the
same
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
both
the
children
been
there
,
the
affair
might
have
been
determined
*NL*
too
easily
by
measuring
them
at
once
;
but
as
Harry
only
was
present
,
it
*NL*
was
all
conjectural
assertion
on
both
sides
;
and
every
body
had
a
right
*NL*
to
be
equally
positive
in
their
opinion
,
and
to
repeat
it
over
and
over
*NL*
again
as
often
as
they
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
parties
stood
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
mothers
,
though
each
really
convinced
that
her
own
son
was
the
*NL*
tallest
,
politely
decided
in
favour
of
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
grandmothers
,
with
not
less
partiality
,
but
more
sincerity
,
*NL*
were
equally
earnest
in
support
of
their
own
descendant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
,
who
was
hardly
less
anxious
to
please
one
parent
than
the
other
,
*NL*
thought
the
boys
were
both
remarkably
tall
for
their
age
,
and
could
not
*NL*
conceive
that
there
could
be
the
smallest
difference
in
the
world
*NL*
between
them
;
and
Miss
Steele
,
with
yet
greater
address
gave
it
,
as
*NL*
fast
as
she
could
,
in
favour
of
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
having
once
delivered
her
opinion
on
William
's
side
,
by
which
*NL*
she
offended
Mrs.
Ferrars
and
Fanny
still
more
,
did
not
see
the
*NL*
necessity
of
enforcing
it
by
any
farther
assertion
;
and
Marianne
,
when
*NL*
called
on
for
hers
,
offended
them
all
,
by
declaring
that
she
had
no
*NL*
opinion
to
give
,
as
she
had
never
thought
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
her
removing
from
Norland
,
Elinor
had
painted
a
very
pretty
pair
*NL*
of
screens
for
her
sister-in-law
,
which
being
now
just
mounted
and
*NL*
brought
home
,
ornamented
her
present
drawing
room
;
and
these
screens
,
*NL*
catching
the
eye
of
John
Dashwood
on
his
following
the
other
gentlemen
*NL*
into
the
room
,
were
officiously
handed
by
him
to
Colonel
Brandon
for
*NL*
his
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
done
by
my
eldest
sister
,
''
said
he
;
``
and
you
,
as
a
man
of
*NL*
taste
,
will
,
I
dare
say
,
be
pleased
with
them
.
I
do
not
know
whether
*NL*
you
have
ever
happened
to
see
any
of
her
performances
before
,
but
she
*NL*
is
in
general
reckoned
to
draw
extremely
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Colonel
,
though
disclaiming
all
pretensions
to
connoisseurship
,
*NL*
warmly
admired
the
screens
,
as
he
would
have
done
any
thing
painted
by
*NL*
Miss
Dashwood
;
and
on
the
curiosity
of
the
others
being
of
course
*NL*
excited
,
they
were
handed
round
for
general
inspection
.
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
*NL*
not
aware
of
their
being
Elinor
's
work
,
particularly
requested
to
look
*NL*
at
them
;
and
after
they
had
received
gratifying
testimony
of
Lady
*NL*
Middletons
's
approbation
,
Fanny
presented
them
to
her
mother
,
*NL*
considerately
informing
her
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
they
were
done
by
*NL*
Miss
Dashwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hum
''
--
said
Mrs.
Ferrars
--
``
very
pretty
,
''
--
and
without
regarding
them
at
*NL*
all
,
returned
them
to
her
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
Fanny
thought
for
a
moment
that
her
mother
had
been
quite
rude
*NL*
enough
,
--
for
,
colouring
a
little
,
she
immediately
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
very
pretty
,
ma'am
--
a
n't
they
?
''
But
then
again
,
the
dread
of
*NL*
having
been
too
civil
,
too
encouraging
herself
,
probably
came
over
her
,
*NL*
for
she
presently
added
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
think
they
are
something
in
Miss
Morton
's
style
of
*NL*
painting
,
Ma'am
?
--
She
DOES
paint
most
delightfully
!
--
How
beautifully
*NL*
her
last
landscape
is
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beautifully
indeed
!
But
SHE
does
every
thing
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
could
not
bear
this
.
--
She
was
already
greatly
displeased
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Ferrars
;
and
such
ill-timed
praise
of
another
,
at
Elinor
's
*NL*
expense
,
though
she
had
not
any
notion
of
what
was
principally
meant
by
*NL*
it
,
provoked
her
immediately
to
say
with
warmth
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
admiration
of
a
very
particular
kind
!
--
what
is
Miss
Morton
to
*NL*
us
?
--
who
knows
,
or
who
cares
,
for
her
?
--
it
is
Elinor
of
whom
WE
think
*NL*
and
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
saying
,
she
took
the
screens
out
of
her
sister-in-law
's
hands
,
*NL*
to
admire
them
herself
as
they
ought
to
be
admired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Ferrars
looked
exceedingly
angry
,
and
drawing
herself
up
more
*NL*
stiffly
than
ever
,
pronounced
in
retort
this
bitter
philippic
,
``
Miss
*NL*
Morton
is
Lord
Morton
's
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
looked
very
angry
too
,
and
her
husband
was
all
in
a
fright
at
his
*NL*
sister
's
audacity
.
Elinor
was
much
more
hurt
by
Marianne
's
warmth
than
*NL*
she
had
been
by
what
produced
it
;
but
Colonel
Brandon
's
eyes
,
as
they
*NL*
were
fixed
on
Marianne
,
declared
that
he
noticed
only
what
was
amiable
*NL*
in
it
,
the
affectionate
heart
which
could
not
bear
to
see
a
sister
*NL*
slighted
in
the
smallest
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
's
feelings
did
not
stop
here
.
The
cold
insolence
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Ferrars
's
general
behaviour
to
her
sister
,
seemed
,
to
her
,
to
foretell
*NL*
such
difficulties
and
distresses
to
Elinor
,
as
her
own
wounded
heart
*NL*
taught
her
to
think
of
with
horror
;
and
urged
by
a
strong
impulse
of
*NL*
affectionate
sensibility
,
she
moved
after
a
moment
,
to
her
sister
's
*NL*
chair
,
and
putting
one
arm
round
her
neck
,
and
one
cheek
close
to
hers
,
*NL*
said
in
a
low
,
but
eager
,
voice
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
Elinor
,
do
n't
mind
them
.
Do
n't
let
them
make
YOU
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
say
no
more
;
her
spirits
were
quite
overcome
,
and
hiding
her
*NL*
face
on
Elinor
's
shoulder
,
she
burst
into
tears
.
Every
body
's
*NL*
attention
was
called
,
and
almost
every
body
was
concerned
.
--
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
rose
up
and
went
to
them
without
knowing
what
he
did
.
--
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
,
with
a
very
intelligent
``
Ah
!
poor
dear
,
''
immediately
gave
her
*NL*
her
salts
;
and
Sir
John
felt
so
desperately
enraged
against
the
author
*NL*
of
this
nervous
distress
,
that
he
instantly
changed
his
seat
to
one
*NL*
close
by
Lucy
Steele
,
and
gave
her
,
in
a
whisper
,
a
brief
account
of
*NL*
the
whole
shocking
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
,
however
,
Marianne
was
recovered
enough
to
put
an
end
*NL*
to
the
bustle
,
and
sit
down
among
the
rest
;
though
her
spirits
retained
*NL*
the
impression
of
what
had
passed
,
the
whole
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Marianne
!
''
said
her
brother
to
Colonel
Brandon
,
in
a
low
voice
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
could
secure
his
attention
,
--
``
She
has
not
such
good
*NL*
health
as
her
sister
,
--
she
is
very
nervous
,
--
she
has
not
Elinor
's
*NL*
constitution
;
--
and
one
must
allow
that
there
is
something
very
trying
*NL*
to
a
young
woman
who
HAS
BEEN
a
beauty
in
the
loss
of
her
personal
*NL*
attractions
.
You
would
not
think
it
perhaps
,
but
Marianne
WAS
*NL*
remarkably
handsome
a
few
months
ago
;
quite
as
handsome
as
Elinor
.
--
*NL*
Now
you
see
it
is
all
gone
.

CHAPTER
35
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
curiosity
to
see
Mrs.
Ferrars
was
satisfied
.
--
She
had
found
*NL*
in
her
every
thing
that
could
tend
to
make
a
farther
connection
between
*NL*
the
families
undesirable
.
--
She
had
seen
enough
of
her
pride
,
her
*NL*
meanness
,
and
her
determined
prejudice
against
herself
,
to
comprehend
*NL*
all
the
difficulties
that
must
have
perplexed
the
engagement
,
and
*NL*
retarded
the
marriage
,
of
Edward
and
herself
,
had
he
been
otherwise
*NL*
free
;
--
and
she
had
seen
almost
enough
to
be
thankful
for
her
OWN
sake
,
*NL*
that
one
greater
obstacle
preserved
her
from
suffering
under
any
other
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
creation
,
preserved
her
from
all
dependence
upon
her
*NL*
caprice
,
or
any
solicitude
for
her
good
opinion
.
Or
at
least
,
if
she
*NL*
did
not
bring
herself
quite
to
rejoice
in
Edward
's
being
fettered
to
*NL*
Lucy
,
she
determined
,
that
had
Lucy
been
more
amiable
,
she
OUGHT
to
*NL*
have
rejoiced
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
that
Lucy
's
spirits
could
be
so
very
much
elevated
by
the
*NL*
civility
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
;
--
that
her
interest
and
her
vanity
should
so
*NL*
very
much
blind
her
as
to
make
the
attention
which
seemed
only
paid
her
*NL*
because
she
was
NOT
ELINOR
,
appear
a
compliment
to
herself
--
or
to
allow
*NL*
her
to
derive
encouragement
from
a
preference
only
given
her
,
because
*NL*
her
real
situation
was
unknown
.
But
that
it
was
so
,
had
not
only
been
*NL*
declared
by
Lucy
's
eyes
at
the
time
,
but
was
declared
over
again
the
*NL*
next
morning
more
openly
,
for
at
her
particular
desire
,
Lady
Middleton
*NL*
set
her
down
in
Berkeley
Street
on
the
chance
of
seeing
Elinor
alone
,
*NL*
to
tell
her
how
happy
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chance
proved
a
lucky
one
,
for
a
message
from
Mrs.
Palmer
soon
*NL*
after
she
arrived
,
carried
Mrs.
Jennings
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend
,
''
cried
Lucy
,
as
soon
as
they
were
by
themselves
,
``
I
*NL*
come
to
talk
to
you
of
my
happiness
.
Could
anything
be
so
flattering
*NL*
as
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
way
of
treating
me
yesterday
?
So
exceeding
affable
*NL*
as
she
was
!
--
You
know
how
I
dreaded
the
thoughts
of
seeing
her
;
--
but
*NL*
the
very
moment
I
was
introduced
,
there
was
such
an
affability
in
her
*NL*
behaviour
as
really
should
seem
to
say
,
she
had
quite
took
a
fancy
to
*NL*
me
.
Now
was
not
it
so
?
--
You
saw
it
all
;
and
was
not
you
quite
struck
*NL*
with
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
certainly
very
civil
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Civil
!
--
Did
you
see
nothing
but
only
civility
?
--
I
saw
a
vast
deal
*NL*
more
.
Such
kindness
as
fell
to
the
share
of
nobody
but
me
!
--
No
pride
,
*NL*
no
hauteur
,
and
your
sister
just
the
same
--
all
sweetness
and
*NL*
affability
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
wished
to
talk
of
something
else
,
but
Lucy
still
pressed
her
to
*NL*
own
that
she
had
reason
for
her
happiness
;
and
Elinor
was
obliged
to
go
*NL*
on
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
,
if
they
had
known
your
engagement
,
''
said
she
,
``
nothing
*NL*
could
be
more
flattering
than
their
treatment
of
you
;
--
but
as
that
was
*NL*
not
the
case
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guessed
you
would
say
so
,
''
--
replied
Lucy
quickly
--
``
but
there
was
no
*NL*
reason
in
the
world
why
Mrs.
Ferrars
should
seem
to
like
me
,
if
she
did
*NL*
not
,
and
her
liking
me
is
every
thing
.
You
sha
n't
talk
me
out
of
my
*NL*
satisfaction
.
I
am
sure
it
will
all
end
well
,
and
there
will
be
no
*NL*
difficulties
at
all
,
to
what
I
used
to
think
.
Mrs.
Ferrars
is
a
*NL*
charming
woman
,
and
so
is
your
sister
.
They
are
both
delightful
women
,
*NL*
indeed
!
--
I
wonder
I
should
never
hear
you
say
how
agreeable
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashwood
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Elinor
had
no
answer
to
make
,
and
did
not
attempt
any
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ill
,
Miss
Dashwood
?
--
you
seem
low
--
you
do
n't
speak
;
--
sure
you
*NL*
a
n't
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
was
in
better
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
it
with
all
my
heart
;
but
really
you
did
not
look
it
.
I
*NL*
should
be
sorry
to
have
YOU
ill
;
you
,
that
have
been
the
greatest
*NL*
comfort
to
me
in
the
world
!
--
Heaven
knows
what
I
should
have
done
*NL*
without
your
friendship
.
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
tried
to
make
a
civil
answer
,
though
doubting
her
own
success
.
*NL*
But
it
seemed
to
satisfy
Lucy
,
for
she
directly
replied
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
am
perfectly
convinced
of
your
regard
for
me
,
and
next
to
*NL*
Edward
's
love
,
it
is
the
greatest
comfort
I
have
.
--
Poor
Edward
!
--
But
*NL*
now
there
is
one
good
thing
,
we
shall
be
able
to
meet
,
and
meet
pretty
*NL*
often
,
for
Lady
Middleton
's
delighted
with
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
so
we
shall
*NL*
be
a
good
deal
in
Harley
Street
,
I
dare
say
,
and
Edward
spends
half
his
*NL*
time
with
his
sister
--
besides
,
Lady
Middleton
and
Mrs.
Ferrars
will
*NL*
visit
now
;
--
and
Mrs.
Ferrars
and
your
sister
were
both
so
good
to
say
*NL*
more
than
once
,
they
should
always
be
glad
to
see
me
.
--
They
are
such
*NL*
charming
women
!
--
I
am
sure
if
ever
you
tell
your
sister
what
I
think
of
*NL*
her
,
you
can
not
speak
too
high
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Elinor
would
not
give
her
any
encouragement
to
hope
that
she
SHOULD
*NL*
tell
her
sister
.
Lucy
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
should
have
seen
it
in
a
moment
,
if
Mrs.
Ferrars
had
took
*NL*
a
dislike
to
me
.
If
she
had
only
made
me
a
formal
courtesy
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
without
saying
a
word
,
and
never
after
had
took
any
notice
of
*NL*
me
,
and
never
looked
at
me
in
a
pleasant
way
--
you
know
what
I
mean
--
if
*NL*
I
had
been
treated
in
that
forbidding
sort
of
way
,
I
should
have
gave
*NL*
it
all
up
in
despair
.
I
could
not
have
stood
it
.
For
where
she
DOES
*NL*
dislike
,
I
know
it
is
most
violent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
was
prevented
from
making
any
reply
to
this
civil
triumph
,
by
*NL*
the
door
's
being
thrown
open
,
the
servant
's
announcing
Mr.
Ferrars
,
and
*NL*
Edward
's
immediately
walking
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
awkward
moment
;
and
the
countenance
of
each
shewed
that
*NL*
it
was
so
.
They
all
looked
exceedingly
foolish
;
and
Edward
seemed
to
*NL*
have
as
great
an
inclination
to
walk
out
of
the
room
again
,
as
to
*NL*
advance
farther
into
it
.
The
very
circumstance
,
in
its
unpleasantest
*NL*
form
,
which
they
would
each
have
been
most
anxious
to
avoid
,
had
fallen
*NL*
on
them
.
--
They
were
not
only
all
three
together
,
but
were
together
*NL*
without
the
relief
of
any
other
person
.
The
ladies
recovered
*NL*
themselves
first
.
It
was
not
Lucy
's
business
to
put
herself
forward
,
*NL*
and
the
appearance
of
secrecy
must
still
be
kept
up
.
She
could
*NL*
therefore
only
LOOK
her
tenderness
,
and
after
slightly
addressing
him
,
*NL*
said
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Elinor
had
more
to
do
;
and
so
anxious
was
she
,
for
his
sake
and
her
*NL*
own
,
to
do
it
well
,
that
she
forced
herself
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
recollection
,
to
welcome
him
,
with
a
look
and
manner
that
were
almost
*NL*
easy
,
and
almost
open
;
and
another
struggle
,
another
effort
still
*NL*
improved
them
.
She
would
not
allow
the
presence
of
Lucy
,
nor
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
some
injustice
towards
herself
,
to
deter
her
from
*NL*
saying
that
she
was
happy
to
see
him
,
and
that
she
had
very
much
*NL*
regretted
being
from
home
,
when
he
called
before
in
Berkeley
Street
.
*NL*
She
would
not
be
frightened
from
paying
him
those
attentions
which
,
as
*NL*
a
friend
and
almost
a
relation
,
were
his
due
,
by
the
observant
eyes
of
*NL*
Lucy
,
though
she
soon
perceived
them
to
be
narrowly
watching
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
manners
gave
some
re-assurance
to
Edward
,
and
he
had
courage
enough
*NL*
to
sit
down
;
but
his
embarrassment
still
exceeded
that
of
the
ladies
in
*NL*
a
proportion
,
which
the
case
rendered
reasonable
,
though
his
sex
might
*NL*
make
it
rare
;
for
his
heart
had
not
the
indifference
of
Lucy
's
,
nor
*NL*
could
his
conscience
have
quite
the
ease
of
Elinor
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
,
with
a
demure
and
settled
air
,
seemed
determined
to
make
no
*NL*
contribution
to
the
comfort
of
the
others
,
and
would
not
say
a
word
;
*NL*
and
almost
every
thing
that
WAS
said
,
proceeded
from
Elinor
,
who
was
*NL*
obliged
to
volunteer
all
the
information
about
her
mother
's
health
,
*NL*
their
coming
to
town
,
&
c.
which
Edward
ought
to
have
inquired
about
,
*NL*
but
never
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
exertions
did
not
stop
here
;
for
she
soon
afterwards
felt
herself
*NL*
so
heroically
disposed
as
to
determine
,
under
pretence
of
fetching
*NL*
Marianne
,
to
leave
the
others
by
themselves
;
and
she
really
did
it
,
and
*NL*
THAT
in
the
handsomest
manner
,
for
she
loitered
away
several
minutes
on
*NL*
the
landing-place
,
with
the
most
high-minded
fortitude
,
before
she
went
*NL*
to
her
sister
.
When
that
was
once
done
,
however
,
it
was
time
for
the
*NL*
raptures
of
Edward
to
cease
;
for
Marianne
's
joy
hurried
her
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
immediately
.
Her
pleasure
in
seeing
him
was
like
every
*NL*
other
of
her
feelings
,
strong
in
itself
,
and
strongly
spoken
.
She
met
*NL*
him
with
a
hand
that
would
be
taken
,
and
a
voice
that
expressed
the
*NL*
affection
of
a
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Edward
!
''
she
cried
,
``
this
is
a
moment
of
great
happiness
!
--
This
*NL*
would
almost
make
amends
for
every
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
tried
to
return
her
kindness
as
it
deserved
,
but
before
such
*NL*
witnesses
he
dared
not
say
half
what
he
really
felt
.
Again
they
all
*NL*
sat
down
,
and
for
a
moment
or
two
all
were
silent
;
while
Marianne
was
*NL*
looking
with
the
most
speaking
tenderness
,
sometimes
at
Edward
and
*NL*
sometimes
at
Elinor
,
regretting
only
that
their
delight
in
each
other
*NL*
should
be
checked
by
Lucy
's
unwelcome
presence
.
Edward
was
the
first
*NL*
to
speak
,
and
it
was
to
notice
Marianne
's
altered
looks
,
and
express
*NL*
his
fear
of
her
not
finding
London
agree
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
think
of
me
!
''
she
replied
with
spirited
earnestness
,
though
*NL*
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
as
she
spoke
,
``
do
n't
think
of
MY
*NL*
health
.
Elinor
is
well
,
you
see
.
That
must
be
enough
for
us
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
remark
was
not
calculated
to
make
Edward
or
Elinor
more
easy
,
nor
*NL*
to
conciliate
the
good
will
of
Lucy
,
who
looked
up
at
Marianne
with
no
*NL*
very
benignant
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
London
?
''
said
Edward
,
willing
to
say
any
thing
that
might
*NL*
introduce
another
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
I
expected
much
pleasure
in
it
,
but
I
have
found
none
.
*NL*
The
sight
of
you
,
Edward
,
is
the
only
comfort
it
has
afforded
;
and
*NL*
thank
Heaven
!
you
are
what
you
always
were
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
--
no
one
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
Elinor
,
''
she
presently
added
,
``
we
must
employ
Edward
to
take
*NL*
care
of
us
in
our
return
to
Barton
.
In
a
week
or
two
,
I
suppose
,
we
*NL*
shall
be
going
;
and
,
I
trust
,
Edward
will
not
be
very
unwilling
to
*NL*
accept
the
charge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Edward
muttered
something
,
but
what
it
was
,
nobody
knew
,
not
even
*NL*
himself
.
But
Marianne
,
who
saw
his
agitation
,
and
could
easily
trace
*NL*
it
to
whatever
cause
best
pleased
herself
,
was
perfectly
satisfied
,
and
*NL*
soon
talked
of
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
spent
such
a
day
,
Edward
,
in
Harley
Street
yesterday
!
So
dull
,
so
*NL*
wretchedly
dull
!
--
But
I
have
much
to
say
to
you
on
that
head
,
which
*NL*
can
not
be
said
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
this
admirable
discretion
did
she
defer
the
assurance
of
her
*NL*
finding
their
mutual
relatives
more
disagreeable
than
ever
,
and
of
her
*NL*
being
particularly
disgusted
with
his
mother
,
till
they
were
more
in
*NL*
private
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
were
you
not
there
,
Edward
?
--
Why
did
you
not
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
engaged
elsewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Engaged
!
But
what
was
that
,
when
such
friends
were
to
be
met
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
Miss
Marianne
,
''
cried
Lucy
,
eager
to
take
some
revenge
on
*NL*
her
,
``
you
think
young
men
never
stand
upon
engagements
,
if
they
have
no
*NL*
mind
to
keep
them
,
little
as
well
as
great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
was
very
angry
,
but
Marianne
seemed
entirely
insensible
of
the
*NL*
sting
;
for
she
calmly
replied
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
indeed
;
for
,
seriously
speaking
,
I
am
very
sure
that
*NL*
conscience
only
kept
Edward
from
Harley
Street
.
And
I
really
believe
*NL*
he
HAS
the
most
delicate
conscience
in
the
world
;
the
most
scrupulous
*NL*
in
performing
every
engagement
,
however
minute
,
and
however
it
may
make
*NL*
against
his
interest
or
pleasure
.
He
is
the
most
fearful
of
giving
*NL*
pain
,
of
wounding
expectation
,
and
the
most
incapable
of
being
selfish
,
*NL*
of
any
body
I
ever
saw
.
Edward
,
it
is
so
,
and
I
will
say
it
.
What
!
*NL*
are
you
never
to
hear
yourself
praised
!
--
Then
you
must
be
no
friend
of
*NL*
mine
;
for
those
who
will
accept
of
my
love
and
esteem
,
must
submit
to
*NL*
my
open
commendation
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
nature
of
her
commendation
,
in
the
present
case
,
however
,
happened
*NL*
to
be
particularly
ill-suited
to
the
feelings
of
two
thirds
of
her
*NL*
auditors
,
and
was
so
very
unexhilarating
to
Edward
,
that
he
very
soon
*NL*
got
up
to
go
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
so
soon
!
''
said
Marianne
;
``
my
dear
Edward
,
this
must
not
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
drawing
him
a
little
aside
,
she
whispered
her
persuasion
that
Lucy
*NL*
could
not
stay
much
longer
.
But
even
this
encouragement
failed
,
for
he
*NL*
would
go
;
and
Lucy
,
who
would
have
outstaid
him
,
had
his
visit
lasted
*NL*
two
hours
,
soon
afterwards
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
bring
her
here
so
often
?
''
said
Marianne
,
on
her
leaving
them
.
*NL*
``
Could
not
she
see
that
we
wanted
her
gone
!
--
how
teazing
to
Edward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
--
we
were
all
his
friends
,
and
Lucy
has
been
the
longest
known
*NL*
to
him
of
any
.
It
is
but
natural
that
he
should
like
to
see
her
as
*NL*
well
as
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
looked
at
her
steadily
,
and
said
,
``
You
know
,
Elinor
,
that
this
*NL*
is
a
kind
of
talking
which
I
can
not
bear
.
If
you
only
hope
to
have
*NL*
your
assertion
contradicted
,
as
I
must
suppose
to
be
the
case
,
you
*NL*
ought
to
recollect
that
I
am
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
do
it
.
I
*NL*
can
not
descend
to
be
tricked
out
of
assurances
,
that
are
not
really
*NL*
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
left
the
room
;
and
Elinor
dared
not
follow
her
to
say
more
,
*NL*
for
bound
as
she
was
by
her
promise
of
secrecy
to
Lucy
,
she
could
give
*NL*
no
information
that
would
convince
Marianne
;
and
painful
as
the
*NL*
consequences
of
her
still
continuing
in
an
error
might
be
,
she
was
*NL*
obliged
to
submit
to
it
.
All
that
she
could
hope
,
was
that
Edward
*NL*
would
not
often
expose
her
or
himself
to
the
distress
of
hearing
*NL*
Marianne
's
mistaken
warmth
,
nor
to
the
repetition
of
any
other
part
of
*NL*
the
pain
that
had
attended
their
recent
meeting
--
and
this
she
had
every
*NL*
reason
to
expect
.

CHAPTER
36
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Within
a
few
days
after
this
meeting
,
the
newspapers
announced
to
the
*NL*
world
,
that
the
lady
of
Thomas
Palmer
,
Esq.
was
safely
delivered
of
a
*NL*
son
and
heir
;
a
very
interesting
and
satisfactory
paragraph
,
at
least
*NL*
to
all
those
intimate
connections
who
knew
it
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
event
,
highly
important
to
Mrs.
Jennings
's
happiness
,
produced
a
*NL*
temporary
alteration
in
the
disposal
of
her
time
,
and
influenced
,
in
a
*NL*
like
degree
,
the
engagements
of
her
young
friends
;
for
as
she
wished
to
*NL*
be
as
much
as
possible
with
Charlotte
,
she
went
thither
every
morning
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
was
dressed
,
and
did
not
return
till
late
in
the
evening
;
*NL*
and
the
Miss
Dashwoods
,
at
the
particular
request
of
the
Middletons
,
*NL*
spent
the
whole
of
every
day
in
Conduit
Street
.
For
their
own
comfort
*NL*
they
would
much
rather
have
remained
,
at
least
all
the
morning
,
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
's
house
;
but
it
was
not
a
thing
to
be
urged
against
the
wishes
*NL*
of
everybody
.
Their
hours
were
therefore
made
over
to
Lady
Middleton
and
*NL*
the
two
Miss
Steeles
,
by
whom
their
company
,
in
fact
was
as
little
*NL*
valued
,
as
it
was
professedly
sought
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
too
much
sense
to
be
desirable
companions
to
the
former
;
and
*NL*
by
the
latter
they
were
considered
with
a
jealous
eye
,
as
intruding
on
*NL*
THEIR
ground
,
and
sharing
the
kindness
which
they
wanted
to
monopolize
.
*NL*
Though
nothing
could
be
more
polite
than
Lady
Middleton
's
behaviour
to
*NL*
Elinor
and
Marianne
,
she
did
not
really
like
them
at
all
.
Because
they
*NL*
neither
flattered
herself
nor
her
children
,
she
could
not
believe
them
*NL*
good-natured
;
and
because
they
were
fond
of
reading
,
she
fancied
them
*NL*
satirical
:
perhaps
without
exactly
knowing
what
it
was
to
be
satirical
;
*NL*
but
THAT
did
not
signify
.
It
was
censure
in
common
use
,
and
easily
*NL*
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
presence
was
a
restraint
both
on
her
and
on
Lucy
.
It
checked
the
*NL*
idleness
of
one
,
and
the
business
of
the
other
.
Lady
Middleton
was
*NL*
ashamed
of
doing
nothing
before
them
,
and
the
flattery
which
Lucy
was
*NL*
proud
to
think
of
and
administer
at
other
times
,
she
feared
they
would
*NL*
despise
her
for
offering
.
Miss
Steele
was
the
least
discomposed
of
the
*NL*
three
,
by
their
presence
;
and
it
was
in
their
power
to
reconcile
her
to
*NL*
it
entirely
.
Would
either
of
them
only
have
given
her
a
full
and
*NL*
minute
account
of
the
whole
affair
between
Marianne
and
Mr.
Willoughby
,
*NL*
she
would
have
thought
herself
amply
rewarded
for
the
sacrifice
of
the
*NL*
best
place
by
the
fire
after
dinner
,
which
their
arrival
occasioned
.
*NL*
But
this
conciliation
was
not
granted
;
for
though
she
often
threw
out
*NL*
expressions
of
pity
for
her
sister
to
Elinor
,
and
more
than
once
dropt
*NL*
a
reflection
on
the
inconstancy
of
beaux
before
Marianne
,
no
effect
was
*NL*
produced
,
but
a
look
of
indifference
from
the
former
,
or
of
disgust
in
*NL*
the
latter
.
An
effort
even
yet
lighter
might
have
made
her
their
*NL*
friend
.
Would
they
only
have
laughed
at
her
about
the
Doctor
!
But
so
*NL*
little
were
they
,
anymore
than
the
others
,
inclined
to
oblige
her
,
that
*NL*
if
Sir
John
dined
from
home
,
she
might
spend
a
whole
day
without
*NL*
hearing
any
other
raillery
on
the
subject
,
than
what
she
was
kind
*NL*
enough
to
bestow
on
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
jealousies
and
discontents
,
however
,
were
so
totally
*NL*
unsuspected
by
Mrs.
Jennings
,
that
she
thought
it
a
delightful
thing
*NL*
for
the
girls
to
be
together
;
and
generally
congratulated
her
young
*NL*
friends
every
night
,
on
having
escaped
the
company
of
a
stupid
old
*NL*
woman
so
long
.
She
joined
them
sometimes
at
Sir
John
's
,
sometimes
at
*NL*
her
own
house
;
but
wherever
it
was
,
she
always
came
in
excellent
*NL*
spirits
,
full
of
delight
and
importance
,
attributing
Charlotte
's
well
*NL*
doing
to
her
own
care
,
and
ready
to
give
so
exact
,
so
minute
a
detail
*NL*
of
her
situation
,
as
only
Miss
Steele
had
curiosity
enough
to
desire
.
*NL*
One
thing
DID
disturb
her
;
and
of
that
she
made
her
daily
complaint
.
*NL*
Mr.
Palmer
maintained
the
common
,
but
unfatherly
opinion
among
his
sex
,
*NL*
of
all
infants
being
alike
;
and
though
she
could
plainly
perceive
,
at
*NL*
different
times
,
the
most
striking
resemblance
between
this
baby
and
*NL*
every
one
of
his
relations
on
both
sides
,
there
was
no
convincing
his
*NL*
father
of
it
;
no
persuading
him
to
believe
that
it
was
not
exactly
like
*NL*
every
other
baby
of
the
same
age
;
nor
could
he
even
be
brought
to
*NL*
acknowledge
the
simple
proposition
of
its
being
the
finest
child
in
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
come
now
to
the
relation
of
a
misfortune
,
which
about
this
time
*NL*
befell
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
.
It
so
happened
that
while
her
two
sisters
*NL*
with
Mrs.
Jennings
were
first
calling
on
her
in
Harley
Street
,
another
*NL*
of
her
acquaintance
had
dropt
in
--
a
circumstance
in
itself
not
*NL*
apparently
likely
to
produce
evil
to
her
.
But
while
the
imaginations
*NL*
of
other
people
will
carry
them
away
to
form
wrong
judgments
of
our
*NL*
conduct
,
and
to
decide
on
it
by
slight
appearances
,
one
's
happiness
*NL*
must
in
some
measure
be
always
at
the
mercy
of
chance
.
In
the
present
*NL*
instance
,
this
last-arrived
lady
allowed
her
fancy
to
so
far
outrun
*NL*
truth
and
probability
,
that
on
merely
hearing
the
name
of
the
Miss
*NL*
Dashwoods
,
and
understanding
them
to
be
Mr.
Dashwood
's
sisters
,
she
*NL*
immediately
concluded
them
to
be
staying
in
Harley
Street
;
and
this
*NL*
misconstruction
produced
within
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
cards
of
*NL*
invitation
for
them
as
well
as
for
their
brother
and
sister
,
to
a
small
*NL*
musical
party
at
her
house
.
The
consequence
of
which
was
,
that
Mrs.
*NL*
John
Dashwood
was
obliged
to
submit
not
only
to
the
exceedingly
great
*NL*
inconvenience
of
sending
her
carriage
for
the
Miss
Dashwoods
,
but
,
what
*NL*
was
still
worse
,
must
be
subject
to
all
the
unpleasantness
of
appearing
*NL*
to
treat
them
with
attention
:
and
who
could
tell
that
they
might
not
*NL*
expect
to
go
out
with
her
a
second
time
?
The
power
of
disappointing
*NL*
them
,
it
was
true
,
must
always
be
hers
.
But
that
was
not
enough
;
for
*NL*
when
people
are
determined
on
a
mode
of
conduct
which
they
know
to
be
*NL*
wrong
,
they
feel
injured
by
the
expectation
of
any
thing
better
from
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
had
now
been
brought
by
degrees
,
so
much
into
the
habit
of
*NL*
going
out
every
day
,
that
it
was
become
a
matter
of
indifference
to
*NL*
her
,
whether
she
went
or
not
:
and
she
prepared
quietly
and
mechanically
*NL*
for
every
evening
's
engagement
,
though
without
expecting
the
smallest
*NL*
amusement
from
any
,
and
very
often
without
knowing
,
till
the
last
*NL*
moment
,
where
it
was
to
take
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
her
dress
and
appearance
she
was
grown
so
perfectly
indifferent
,
as
*NL*
not
to
bestow
half
the
consideration
on
it
,
during
the
whole
of
her
*NL*
toilet
,
which
it
received
from
Miss
Steele
in
the
first
five
minutes
of
*NL*
their
being
together
,
when
it
was
finished
.
Nothing
escaped
HER
minute
*NL*
observation
and
general
curiosity
;
she
saw
every
thing
,
and
asked
every
*NL*
thing
;
was
never
easy
till
she
knew
the
price
of
every
part
of
*NL*
Marianne
's
dress
;
could
have
guessed
the
number
of
her
gowns
altogether
*NL*
with
better
judgment
than
Marianne
herself
,
and
was
not
without
hopes
*NL*
of
finding
out
before
they
parted
,
how
much
her
washing
cost
per
week
,
*NL*
and
how
much
she
had
every
year
to
spend
upon
herself
.
The
*NL*
impertinence
of
these
kind
of
scrutinies
,
moreover
,
was
generally
*NL*
concluded
with
a
compliment
,
which
though
meant
as
its
douceur
,
was
*NL*
considered
by
Marianne
as
the
greatest
impertinence
of
all
;
for
after
*NL*
undergoing
an
examination
into
the
value
and
make
of
her
gown
,
the
*NL*
colour
of
her
shoes
,
and
the
arrangement
of
her
hair
,
she
was
almost
*NL*
sure
of
being
told
that
upon
``
her
word
she
looked
vastly
smart
,
and
she
*NL*
dared
to
say
she
would
make
a
great
many
conquests
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
encouragement
as
this
,
was
she
dismissed
on
the
present
*NL*
occasion
,
to
her
brother
's
carriage
;
which
they
were
ready
to
enter
*NL*
five
minutes
after
it
stopped
at
the
door
,
a
punctuality
not
very
*NL*
agreeable
to
their
sister-in-law
,
who
had
preceded
them
to
the
house
of
*NL*
her
acquaintance
,
and
was
there
hoping
for
some
delay
on
their
part
*NL*
that
might
inconvenience
either
herself
or
her
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
events
of
this
evening
were
not
very
remarkable
.
The
party
,
like
*NL*
other
musical
parties
,
comprehended
a
great
many
people
who
had
real
*NL*
taste
for
the
performance
,
and
a
great
many
more
who
had
none
at
all
;
*NL*
and
the
performers
themselves
were
,
as
usual
,
in
their
own
estimation
,
*NL*
and
that
of
their
immediate
friends
,
the
first
private
performers
in
*NL*
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Elinor
was
neither
musical
,
nor
affecting
to
be
so
,
she
made
no
*NL*
scruple
of
turning
her
eyes
from
the
grand
pianoforte
,
whenever
it
*NL*
suited
her
,
and
unrestrained
even
by
the
presence
of
a
harp
,
and
*NL*
violoncello
,
would
fix
them
at
pleasure
on
any
other
object
in
the
*NL*
room
.
In
one
of
these
excursive
glances
she
perceived
among
a
group
of
*NL*
young
men
,
the
very
he
,
who
had
given
them
a
lecture
on
toothpick-cases
*NL*
at
Gray
's
.
She
perceived
him
soon
afterwards
looking
at
herself
,
and
*NL*
speaking
familiarly
to
her
brother
;
and
had
just
determined
to
find
out
*NL*
his
name
from
the
latter
,
when
they
both
came
towards
her
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Dashwood
introduced
him
to
her
as
Mr.
Robert
Ferrars
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
addressed
her
with
easy
civility
,
and
twisted
his
head
into
a
bow
*NL*
which
assured
her
as
plainly
as
words
could
have
done
,
that
he
was
*NL*
exactly
the
coxcomb
she
had
heard
him
described
to
be
by
Lucy
.
Happy
*NL*
had
it
been
for
her
,
if
her
regard
for
Edward
had
depended
less
on
his
*NL*
own
merit
,
than
on
the
merit
of
his
nearest
relations
!
For
then
his
*NL*
brother
's
bow
must
have
given
the
finishing
stroke
to
what
the
*NL*
ill-humour
of
his
mother
and
sister
would
have
begun
.
But
while
she
*NL*
wondered
at
the
difference
of
the
two
young
men
,
she
did
not
find
that
*NL*
the
emptiness
of
conceit
of
the
one
,
put
her
out
of
all
charity
with
*NL*
the
modesty
and
worth
of
the
other
.
Why
they
WERE
different
,
Robert
*NL*
exclaimed
to
her
himself
in
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
*NL*
conversation
;
for
,
talking
of
his
brother
,
and
lamenting
the
extreme
*NL*
GAUCHERIE
which
he
really
believed
kept
him
from
mixing
in
proper
*NL*
society
,
he
candidly
and
generously
attributed
it
much
less
to
any
*NL*
natural
deficiency
,
than
to
the
misfortune
of
a
private
education
;
*NL*
while
he
himself
,
though
probably
without
any
particular
,
any
material
*NL*
superiority
by
nature
,
merely
from
the
advantage
of
a
public
school
,
*NL*
was
as
well
fitted
to

in
the
world

*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul
,
''
he
added
,
``
I
believe
it
is
nothing
more
;
and
so
I
often
*NL*
tell
my
mother
,
when
she
is
grieving
about
it
.
`
My
dear
Madam
,
'
I
*NL*
always
say
to
her
,
`
you
must
make
yourself
easy
.
The
evil
is
now
*NL*
irremediable
,
and
it
has
been
entirely
your
own
doing
.
Why
would
you
*NL*
be
persuaded
by
my
uncle
,
Sir
Robert
,
against
your
own
judgment
,
to
*NL*
place
Edward
under
private
tuition
,
at
the
most
critical
time
of
his
*NL*
life
?
If
you
had
only
sent
him
to
Westminster
as
well
as
myself
,
*NL*
instead
of
sending
him
to
Mr.
Pratt
's
,
all
this
would
have
been
*NL*
prevented
.
'
This
is
the
way
in
which
I
always
consider
the
matter
,
and
*NL*
my
mother
is
perfectly
convinced
of
her
error
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
would
not
oppose
his
opinion
,
because
,
whatever
might
be
her
*NL*
general
estimation
of
the
advantage
of
a
public
school
,
she
could
not
*NL*
think
of
Edward
's
abode
in
Mr.
Pratt
's
family
,
with
any
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
reside
in
Devonshire
,
I
think
,
''
--
was
his
next
observation
,
``
in
a
*NL*
cottage
near
Dawlish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
set
him
right
as
to
its
situation
;
and
it
seemed
rather
*NL*
surprising
to
him
that
anybody
could
live
in
Devonshire
,
without
living
*NL*
near
Dawlish
.
He
bestowed
his
hearty
approbation
however
on
their
*NL*
species
of
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
own
part
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
am
excessively
fond
of
a
cottage
;
there
*NL*
is
always
so
much
comfort
,
so
much
elegance
about
them
.
And
I
protest
,
*NL*
if
I
had
any
money
to
spare
,
I
should
buy
a
little
land
and
build
one
*NL*
myself
,
within
a
short
distance
of
London
,
where
I
might
drive
myself
*NL*
down
at
any
time
,
and
collect
a
few
friends
about
me
,
and
be
happy
.
I
*NL*
advise
every
body
who
is
going
to
build
,
to
build
a
cottage
.
My
friend
*NL*
Lord
Courtland
came
to
me
the
other
day
on
purpose
to
ask
my
advice
,
*NL*
and
laid
before
me
three
different
plans
of
Bonomi
's
.
I
was
to
decide
*NL*
on
the
best
of
them
.
`
My
dear
Courtland
,
'
said
I
,
immediately
throwing
*NL*
them
all
into
the
fire
,
`
do
not
adopt
either
of
them
,
but
by
all
means
*NL*
build
a
cottage
.
'
And
that
I
fancy
,
will
be
the
end
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
people
imagine
that
there
can
be
no
accommodations
,
no
space
in
a
*NL*
cottage
;
but
this
is
all
a
mistake
.
I
was
last
month
at
my
friend
*NL*
Elliott
's
,
near
Dartford
.
Lady
Elliott
wished
to
give
a
dance
.
`
But
*NL*
how
can
it
be
done
?
'
said
she
;
`
my
dear
Ferrars
,
do
tell
me
how
it
is
*NL*
to
be
managed
.
There
is
not
a
room
in
this
cottage
that
will
hold
ten
*NL*
couple
,
and
where
can
the
supper
be
?
'
I
immediately
saw
that
there
*NL*
could
be
no
difficulty
in
it
,
so
I
said
,
`
My
dear
Lady
Elliott
,
do
not
*NL*
be
uneasy
.
The
dining
parlour
will
admit
eighteen
couple
with
ease
;
*NL*
card-tables
may
be
placed
in
the
drawing-room
;
the
library
may
be
open
*NL*
for
tea
and
other
refreshments
;
and
let
the
supper
be
set
out
in
the
*NL*
saloon
.
'
Lady
Elliott
was
delighted
with
the
thought
.
We
measured
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
and
found
it
would
hold
exactly
eighteen
couple
,
and
the
*NL*
affair
was
arranged
precisely
after
my
plan
.
So
that
,
in
fact
,
you
*NL*
see
,
if
people
do
but
know
how
to
set
about
it
,
every
comfort
may
be
as
*NL*
well
enjoyed
in
a
cottage
as
in
the
most
spacious
dwelling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
agreed
to
it
all
,
for
she
did
not
think
he
deserved
the
*NL*
compliment
of
rational
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
John
Dashwood
had
no
more
pleasure
in
music
than
his
eldest
sister
,
*NL*
his
mind
was
equally
at
liberty
to
fix
on
any
thing
else
;
and
a
thought
*NL*
struck
him
during
the
evening
,
which
he
communicated
to
his
wife
,
for
*NL*
her
approbation
,
when
they
got
home
.
The
consideration
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Dennison
's
mistake
,
in
supposing
his
sisters
their
guests
,
had
*NL*
suggested
the
propriety
of
their
being
really
invited
to
become
such
,
*NL*
while
Mrs.
Jennings
's
engagements
kept
her
from
home
.
The
expense
would
*NL*
be
nothing
,
the
inconvenience
not
more
;
and
it
was
altogether
an
*NL*
attention
which
the
delicacy
of
his
conscience
pointed
out
to
be
*NL*
requisite
to
its
complete
enfranchisement
from
his
promise
to
his
*NL*
father
.
Fanny
was
startled
at
the
proposal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
done
,
''
said
she
,
``
without
affronting
Lady
*NL*
Middleton
,
for
they
spend
every
day
with
her
;
otherwise
I
should
be
*NL*
exceedingly
glad
to
do
it
.
You
know
I
am
always
ready
to
pay
them
any
*NL*
attention
in
my
power
,
as
my
taking
them
out
this
evening
shews
.
But
*NL*
they
are
Lady
Middleton
's
visitors
.
How
can
I
ask
them
away
from
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
,
but
with
great
humility
,
did
not
see
the
force
of
her
*NL*
objection
.
``
They
had
already
spent
a
week
in
this
manner
in
Conduit
*NL*
Street
,
and
Lady
Middleton
could
not
be
displeased
at
their
giving
the
*NL*
same
number
of
days
to
such
near
relations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
,
with
fresh
vigor
,
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
I
would
ask
them
with
all
my
heart
,
if
it
was
in
my
power
.
*NL*
But
I
had
just
settled
within
myself
to
ask
the
Miss
Steeles
to
spend
a
*NL*
few
days
with
us
.
They
are
very
well
behaved
,
good
kind
of
girls
;
and
*NL*
I
think
the
attention
is
due
to
them
,
as
their
uncle
did
so
very
well
*NL*
by
Edward
.
We
can
ask
your
sisters
some
other
year
,
you
know
;
but
the
*NL*
Miss
Steeles
may
not
be
in
town
any
more
.
I
am
sure
you
will
like
*NL*
them
;
indeed
,
you
DO
like
them
,
you
know
,
very
much
already
,
and
so
*NL*
does
my
mother
;
and
they
are
such
favourites
with
Harry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dashwood
was
convinced
.
He
saw
the
necessity
of
inviting
the
Miss
*NL*
Steeles
immediately
,
and
his
conscience
was
pacified
by
the
resolution
*NL*
of
inviting
his
sisters
another
year
;
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
slyly
*NL*
suspecting
that
another
year
would
make
the
invitation
needless
,
by
*NL*
bringing
Elinor
to
town
as
Colonel
Brandon
's
wife
,
and
Marianne
as
*NL*
THEIR
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
rejoicing
in
her
escape
,
and
proud
of
the
ready
wit
that
had
*NL*
procured
it
,
wrote
the
next
morning
to
Lucy
,
to
request
her
company
and
*NL*
her
sister
's
,
for
some
days
,
in
Harley
Street
,
as
soon
as
Lady
*NL*
Middleton
could
spare
them
.
This
was
enough
to
make
Lucy
really
and
*NL*
reasonably
happy
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
seemed
actually
working
for
her
,
*NL*
herself
;
cherishing
all
her
hopes
,
and
promoting
all
her
views
!
Such
*NL*
an
opportunity
of
being
with
Edward
and
his
family
was
,
above
all
*NL*
things
,
the
most
material
to
her
interest
,
and
such
an
invitation
the
*NL*
most
gratifying
to
her
feelings
!
It
was
an
advantage
that
could
not
be
*NL*
too
gratefully
acknowledged
,
nor
too
speedily
made
use
of
;
and
the
*NL*
visit
to
Lady
Middleton
,
which
had
not
before
had
any
precise
limits
,
*NL*
was
instantly
discovered
to
have
been
always
meant
to
end
in
two
days
'
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
note
was
shown
to
Elinor
,
as
it
was
within
ten
minutes
after
*NL*
its
arrival
,
it
gave
her
,
for
the
first
time
,
some
share
in
the
*NL*
expectations
of
Lucy
;
for
such
a
mark
of
uncommon
kindness
,
vouchsafed
*NL*
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
,
seemed
to
declare
that
the
good-will
*NL*
towards
her
arose
from
something
more
than
merely
malice
against
*NL*
herself
;
and
might
be
brought
,
by
time
and
address
,
to
do
every
thing
*NL*
that
Lucy
wished
.
Her
flattery
had
already
subdued
the
pride
of
Lady
*NL*
Middleton
,
and
made
an
entry
into
the
close
heart
of
Mrs.
John
*NL*
Dashwood
;
and
these
were
effects
that
laid
open
the
probability
of
*NL*
greater
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Steeles
removed
to
Harley
Street
,
and
all
that
reached
Elinor
*NL*
of
their
influence
there
,
strengthened
her
expectation
of
the
event
.
*NL*
Sir
John
,
who
called
on
them
more
than
once
,
brought
home
such
accounts
*NL*
of
the
favour
they
were
in
,
as
must
be
universally
striking
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashwood
had
never
been
so
much
pleased
with
any
young
women
in
her
*NL*
life
,
as
she
was
with
them
;
had
given
each
of
them
a
needle
book
made
*NL*
by
some
emigrant
;
called
Lucy
by
her
Christian
name
;
and
did
not
know
*NL*
whether
she
should
ever
be
able
to
part
with
them
.

CHAPTER
37
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Palmer
was
so
well
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
,
that
her
mother
felt
*NL*
it
no
longer
necessary
to
give
up
the
whole
of
her
time
to
her
;
and
,
*NL*
contenting
herself
with
visiting
her
once
or
twice
a
day
,
returned
from
*NL*
that
period
to
her
own
home
,
and
her
own
habits
,
in
which
she
found
the
*NL*
Miss
Dashwoods
very
ready
to
resume
their
former
share
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
third
or
fourth
morning
after
their
being
thus
resettled
in
*NL*
Berkeley
Street
,
Mrs.
Jennings
,
on
returning
from
her
ordinary
visit
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Palmer
,
entered
the
drawing-room
,
where
Elinor
was
sitting
by
*NL*
herself
,
with
an
air
of
such
hurrying
importance
as
prepared
her
to
*NL*
hear
something
wonderful
;
and
giving
her
time
only
to
form
that
idea
,
*NL*
began
directly
to
justify
it
,
by
saying
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
!
my
dear
Miss
Dashwood
!
have
you
heard
the
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
.
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
so
strange
!
But
you
shall
hear
it
all
.
--
When
I
got
to
Mr.
*NL*
Palmer
's
,
I
found
Charlotte
quite
in
a
fuss
about
the
child
.
She
was
*NL*
sure
it
was
very
ill
--
it
cried
,
and
fretted
,
and
was
all
over
pimples
.
*NL*
So
I
looked
at
it
directly
,
and
,
`
Lord
!
my
dear
,
'
says
I
,
`
it
is
*NL*
nothing
in
the
world
,
but
the
red
gum
--
'
and
nurse
said
just
the
same
.
*NL*
But
Charlotte
,
she
would
not
be
satisfied
,
so
Mr.
Donavan
was
sent
for
;
*NL*
and
luckily
he
happened
to
just
come
in
from
Harley
Street
,
so
he
*NL*
stepped
over
directly
,
and
as
soon
as
ever
Mama
,
he
said
*NL*
just
as
we
did
,
that
it
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
red
gum
,
and
*NL*
then
Charlotte
was
easy
.
And
so
,
just
as
he
was
going
away
again
,
it
*NL*
came
into
my
head
,
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
how
I
happened
to
think
of
*NL*
it
,
but
it
came
into
my
head
to
ask
him
if
there
was
any
news
.
So
upon
*NL*
that
,
he
smirked
,
and
simpered
,
and
looked
grave
,
and
seemed
to
know
*NL*
something
or
other
,
and
at
last
he
said
in
a
whisper
,
`
For
fear
any
*NL*
unpleasant
report
should
reach
the
young
ladies
under
your
care
as
to
*NL*
their
sister
's
indisposition
,
I
think
it
advisable
to
say
,
that
I
*NL*
believe
there
is
no
great
reason
for
alarm
;
I
hope
Mrs.
Dashwood
will
*NL*
do
very
well
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
is
Fanny
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
exactly
what
I
said
,
my
dear
.
`
Lord
!
'
says
I
,
`
is
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashwood
ill
?
'
So
then
it
all
came
out
;
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
*NL*
the
matter
,
by
all
I
can
learn
,
seems
to
be
this
.
Mr.
Edward
Ferrars
,
*NL*
the
very
young
man
I
used
to
joke
with
you
about
-LRB-
but
however
,
as
it
*NL*
turns
out
,
I
am
monstrous
glad
there
was
never
any
thing
in
it
-RRB-
,
Mr.
*NL*
Edward
Ferrars
,
it
seems
,
has
been
engaged
above
this
twelvemonth
to
my
*NL*
cousin
Lucy
!
--
There
's
for
you
,
my
dear
!
--
And
not
a
creature
knowing
a
*NL*
syllable
of
the
matter
,
except
Nancy
!
--
Could
you
have
believed
such
a
*NL*
thing
possible
?
--
There
is
no
great
wonder
in
their
liking
one
another
;
*NL*
but
that
matters
should
be
brought
so
forward
between
them
,
and
nobody
*NL*
suspect
it
!
--
THAT
is
strange
!
--
I
never
happened
to
see
them
together
,
*NL*
or
I
am
sure
I
should
have
found
it
out
directly
.
Well
,
and
so
this
*NL*
was
kept
a
great
secret
,
for
fear
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
and
neither
she
nor
*NL*
your
brother
or
sister
suspected
a
word
of
the
matter
;
--
till
this
very
*NL*
morning
,
poor
Nancy
,
who
,
you
know
,
is
a
well-meaning
creature
,
but
no
*NL*
conjurer
,
popt
it
all
out
.
`
Lord
!
'
thinks
she
to
herself
,
`
they
are
*NL*
all
so
fond
of
Lucy
,
to
be
sure
they
will
make
no
difficulty
about
it
;
'
*NL*
and
so
,
away
she
went
to
your
sister
,
who
was
sitting
all
alone
at
her
*NL*
carpet-work
,
little
suspecting
what
was
to
come
--
for
she
had
just
been
*NL*
saying
to
your
brother
,
only
five
minutes
before
,
that
she
thought
to
*NL*
make
a
match
between
Edward
and
some
Lord
's
daughter
or
other
,
I
forget
*NL*
who
.
So
you
may
think
what
a
blow
it
was
to
all
her
vanity
and
pride
.
*NL*
She
fell
into
violent
hysterics
immediately
,
with
such
screams
as
*NL*
reached
your
brother
's
ears
,
as
he
was
sitting
in
his
own
dressing-room
*NL*
down
stairs
,
thinking
about
writing
a
letter
to
his
steward
in
the
*NL*
country
.
So
up
he
flew
directly
,
and
a
terrible
scene
took
place
,
for
*NL*
Lucy
was
come
to
them
by
that
time
,
little
dreaming
what
was
going
on
.
*NL*
Poor
soul
!
I
pity
HER
.
And
I
must
say
,
I
think
she
was
used
very
*NL*
hardly
;
for
your
sister
scolded
like
any
fury
,
and
soon
drove
her
into
*NL*
a
fainting
fit
.
Nancy
,
she
fell
upon
her
knees
,
and
cried
bitterly
;
*NL*
and
your
brother
,
he
walked
about
the
room
,
and
said
he
did
not
know
*NL*
what
to
do
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
declared
they
should
not
stay
a
minute
*NL*
longer
in
the
house
,
and
your
brother
was
forced
to
go
down
upon
HIS
*NL*
knees
too
,
to
persuade
her
to
let
them
stay
till
they
had
packed
up
*NL*
their
clothes
.
THEN
she
fell
into
hysterics
again
,
and
he
was
so
*NL*
frightened
that
he
would
send
for
Mr.
Donavan
,
and
Mr.
Donavan
found
*NL*
the
house
in
all
this
uproar
.
The
carriage
was
at
the
door
ready
to
*NL*
take
my
poor
cousins
away
,
and
they
were
just
stepping
in
as
he
came
*NL*
off
;
poor
Lucy
in
such
a
condition
,
he
says
,
she
could
hardly
walk
;
and
*NL*
Nancy
,
she
was
almost
as
bad
.
I
declare
,
I
have
no
patience
with
your
*NL*
sister
;
and
I
hope
,
with
all
my
heart
,
it
will
be
a
match
in
spite
of
*NL*
her
.
Lord
!
what
a
taking
poor
Mr.
Edward
will
be
in
when
he
hears
of
*NL*
it
!
To
have
his
love
used
so
scornfully
!
for
they
say
he
is
monstrous
*NL*
fond
of
her
,
as
well
he
may
.
I
should
not
wonder
,
if
he
was
to
be
in
*NL*
the
greatest
passion
!
--
and
Mr.
Donavan
thinks
just
the
same
.
He
and
I
*NL*
had
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
it
;
and
the
best
of
all
is
,
that
he
is
*NL*
gone
back
again
to
Harley
Street
,
that
he
may
be
within
call
when
Mrs.
*NL*
Ferrars
is
told
of
it
,
for
she
was
sent
for
as
soon
as
ever
my
cousins
*NL*
left
the
house
,
for
your
sister
was
sure
SHE
would
be
in
hysterics
too
;
*NL*
and
so
she
may
,
for
what
I
care
.
I
have
no
pity
for
either
of
them
.
I
*NL*
have
no
notion
of
people
's
making
such
a
to-do
about
money
and
*NL*
greatness
.
There
is
no
reason
on
earth
why
Mr.
Edward
and
Lucy
should
*NL*
not
marry
;
for
I
am
sure
Mrs.
Ferrars
may
afford
to
do
very
well
by
her
*NL*
son
,
and
though
Lucy
has
next
to
nothing
herself
,
she
knows
better
than
*NL*
any
body
how
to
make
the
most
of
every
thing
;
I
dare
say
,
if
Mrs.
*NL*
Ferrars
would
only
allow
him
five
hundred
a-year
,
she
would
make
as
*NL*
good
an
appearance
with
it
as
any
body
else
would
with
eight
.
Lord
!
*NL*
how
snug
they
might
live
in
such
another
cottage
as
yours
--
or
a
little
*NL*
bigger
--
with
two
maids
,
and
two
men
;
and
I
believe
I
could
help
them
to
*NL*
a
housemaid
,
for
my
Betty
has
a
sister
out
of
place
,
that
would
fit
*NL*
them
exactly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mrs.
Jennings
ceased
,
and
as
Elinor
had
had
time
enough
to
collect
*NL*
her
thoughts
,
she
was
able
to
give
such
an
answer
,
and
make
such
*NL*
observations
,
as
the
subject
might
naturally
be
supposed
to
produce
.
*NL*
Happy
to
find
that
she
was
not
suspected
of
any
extraordinary
interest
*NL*
in
it
;
that
Mrs.
Jennings
-LRB-
as
she
had
of
late
often
hoped
might
be
the
*NL*
case
-RRB-
had
ceased
to
imagine
her
at
all
attached
to
Edward
;
and
happy
*NL*
above
all
the
rest
,
in
the
absence
of
Marianne
,
she
felt
very
well
able
*NL*
to
speak
of
the
affair
without
embarrassment
,
and
to
give
her
judgment
,
*NL*
as
she
believed
,
with
impartiality
on
the
conduct
of
every
one
*NL*
concerned
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
hardly
determine
what
her
own
expectation
of
its
event
really
*NL*
was
;
though
she
earnestly
tried
to
drive
away
the
notion
of
its
being
*NL*
possible
to
end
otherwise
at
last
,
than
in
the
marriage
of
Edward
and
*NL*
Lucy
.
What
Mrs.
Ferrars
would
say
and
do
,
though
there
could
not
be
a
*NL*
doubt
of
its
nature
,
she
was
anxious
to
hear
;
and
still
more
anxious
to
*NL*
know
how
Edward
would
conduct
himself
.
For
HIM
she
felt
much
*NL*
compassion
;
--
for
Lucy
very
little
--
and
it
cost
her
some
pains
to
*NL*
procure
that
little
;
--
for
the
rest
of
the
party
none
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mrs.
Jennings
could
talk
on
no
other
subject
,
Elinor
soon
saw
the
*NL*
necessity
of
preparing
Marianne
for
its
discussion
.
No
time
was
to
be
*NL*
lost
in
undeceiving
her
,
in
making
her
acquainted
with
the
real
truth
,
*NL*
and
in
endeavouring
to
bring
her
to
hear
it
talked
of
by
others
,
*NL*
without
betraying
that
she
felt
any
uneasiness
for
her
sister
,
or
any
*NL*
resentment
against
Edward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
office
was
a
painful
one
.
--
She
was
going
to
remove
what
she
*NL*
really
believed
to
be
her
sister
's
chief
consolation
,
--
to
give
such
*NL*
particulars
of
Edward
as
she
feared
would
ruin
him
for
ever
in
her
good
*NL*
opinion,-and
to
make
Marianne
,
by
a
resemblance
in
their
situations
,
*NL*
which
to
HER
fancy
would
seem
strong
,
feel
all
her
own
disappointment
*NL*
over
again
.
But
unwelcome
as
such
a
task
must
be
,
it
was
necessary
to
*NL*
be
done
,
and
Elinor
therefore
hastened
to
perform
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
far
from
wishing
to
dwell
on
her
own
feelings
,
or
to
*NL*
represent
herself
as
suffering
much
,
any
otherwise
than
as
the
*NL*
self-command
she
had
practised
since
her
first
knowledge
of
Edward
's
*NL*
engagement
,
might
suggest
a
hint
of
what
was
practicable
to
Marianne
.
*NL*
Her
narration
was
clear
and
simple
;
and
though
it
could
not
be
given
*NL*
without
emotion
,
it
was
not
accompanied
by
violent
agitation
,
nor
*NL*
impetuous
grief
.
--
THAT
belonged
rather
to
the
hearer
,
for
Marianne
*NL*
listened
with
horror
,
and
cried
excessively
.
Elinor
was
to
be
the
*NL*
comforter
of
others
in
her
own
distresses
,
no
less
than
in
theirs
;
and
*NL*
all
the
comfort
that
could
be
given
by
assurances
of
her
own
composure
*NL*
of
mind
,
and
a
very
earnest
vindication
of
Edward
from
every
charge
but
*NL*
of
imprudence
,
was
readily
offered
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Marianne
for
some
time
would
give
credit
to
neither
.
Edward
seemed
*NL*
a
second
Willoughby
;
and
acknowledging
as
Elinor
did
,
that
she
HAD
*NL*
loved
him
most
sincerely
,
could
she
feel
less
than
herself
!
As
for
*NL*
Lucy
Steele
,
she
considered
her
so
totally
unamiable
,
so
absolutely
*NL*
incapable
of
attaching
a
sensible
man
,
that
she
could
not
be
persuaded
*NL*
at
first
to
believe
,
and
afterwards
to
pardon
,
any
former
affection
of
*NL*
Edward
for
her
.
She
would
not
even
admit
it
to
have
been
natural
;
and
*NL*
Elinor
left
her
to
be
convinced
that
it
was
so
,
by
that
which
only
*NL*
could
convince
her
,
a
better
knowledge
of
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
first
communication
had
reached
no
farther
than
to
state
the
fact
*NL*
of
the
engagement
,
and
the
length
of
time
it
had
existed
.
--
Marianne
's
*NL*
feelings
had
then
broken
in
,
and
put
an
end
to
all
regularity
of
*NL*
detail
;
and
for
some
time
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
soothe
her
*NL*
distress
,
lessen
her
alarms
,
and
combat
her
resentment
.
The
first
*NL*
question
on
her
side
,
which
led
to
farther
particulars
,
was
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
has
this
been
known
to
you
,
Elinor
?
has
he
written
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
known
it
these
four
months
.
When
Lucy
first
came
to
Barton
*NL*
Park
last
November
,
she
told
me
in
confidence
of
her
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
,
Marianne
's
eyes
expressed
the
astonishment
which
her
*NL*
lips
could
not
utter
.
After
a
pause
of
wonder
,
she
exclaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
months
!
--
Have
you
known
of
this
four
months
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
confirmed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
--
while
attending
me
in
all
my
misery
,
has
this
been
on
your
*NL*
heart
?
--
And
I
have
reproached
you
for
being
happy
!
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
fit
that
you
should
then
know
how
much
I
was
the
reverse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
months
!
''
--
cried
Marianne
again
.
--
``
So
calm
!
--
so
cheerful
!
--
how
*NL*
have
you
been
supported
?
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
feeling
that
I
was
doing
my
duty
.
--
My
promise
to
Lucy
,
obliged
me
*NL*
to
be
secret
.
I
owed
it
to
her
,
therefore
,
to
avoid
giving
any
hint
of
*NL*
the
truth
;
and
I
owed
it
to
my
family
and
friends
,
not
to
create
in
*NL*
them
a
solicitude
about
me
,
which
it
could
not
be
in
my
power
to
*NL*
satisfy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
seemed
much
struck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
very
often
wished
to
undeceive
yourself
and
my
mother
,
''
added
*NL*
Elinor
;
``
and
once
or
twice
I
have
attempted
it
;
--
but
without
betraying
*NL*
my
trust
,
I
never
could
have
convinced
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
months
!
--
and
yet
you
loved
him
!
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
I
did
not
love
only
him
;
--
and
while
the
comfort
of
others
was
*NL*
dear
to
me
,
I
was
glad
to
spare
them
from
knowing
how
much
I
felt
.
*NL*
Now
,
I
can
think
and
speak
of
it
with
little
emotion
.
I
would
not
have
*NL*
you
suffer
on
my
account
;
for
I
assure
you
I
no
longer
suffer
*NL*
materially
myself
.
I
have
many
things
to
support
me
.
I
am
not
*NL*
conscious
of
having
provoked
the
disappointment
by
any
imprudence
of
my
*NL*
own
,
I
have
borne
it
as
much
as
possible
without
spreading
it
farther
.
*NL*
I
acquit
Edward
of
essential
misconduct
.
I
wish
him
very
happy
;
and
I
*NL*
am
so
sure
of
his
always
doing
his
duty
,
that
though
now
he
may
harbour
*NL*
some
regret
,
in
the
end
he
must
become
so
.
Lucy
does
not
want
sense
,
*NL*
and
that
is
the
foundation
on
which
every
thing
good
may
be
built
.
--
And
*NL*
after
all
,
Marianne
,
after
all
that
is
bewitching
in
the
idea
of
a
*NL*
single
and
constant
attachment
,
and
all
that
can
be
said
of
one
's
*NL*
happiness
depending
entirely
on
any
particular
person
,
it
is
not
*NL*
meant
--
it
is
not
fit
--
it
is
not
possible
that
it
should
be
so
.
--
Edward
*NL*
will
marry
Lucy
;
he
will
marry
a
woman
superior
in
person
and
*NL*
understanding
to
half
her
sex
;
and
time
and
habit
will
teach
him
to
*NL*
forget
that
he
ever
thought
another
superior
to
HER
.

--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
such
is
your

thinking

said
Marianne
,
``
if
the
loss

what

is
most

resolution

your
self-command

are
,
perhaps
,
a
little
less
to
be

wondered
at

They
are
brought
more
within
my
comprehension

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
you
.
--
You
do
not
suppose
that
I
have
ever
felt
much

For
*NL*
four
months
,
Marianne
,
I
have
had
all
this
hanging
on
my
mind
,
without
*NL*
being
at
liberty
to
speak
of
it
to
a
single
creature
;
knowing
that
it
*NL*
would
make
you
and
my
mother
most
unhappy
whenever
it
were
explained
to
*NL*
you
,
yet
unable
to
prepare
you
for
it
in
the
least

It
was
told
*NL*
me
,
--
it
was
in
a
manner
forced
on
me
by
the
very
person
herself
,
whose
*NL*
prior
engagement
ruined
all
my
prospects
;
and
told
me
,
as
I
thought
,
*NL*
with
triumph

This
person
's
suspicions

therefore
,
I
have
had
to
*NL*
oppose
,
by
endeavouring
to
appear
indifferent
where
I
have
been
most
*NL*
deeply
interested
;
--
and
it
has
not
been
only
once
;
--
I
have
had
her
*NL*
hopes
and
exultation
to
listen
to
again
and
again
.
--
I
have
known
*NL*
myself
to
be
divided
from
Edward
for
ever
,
without
hearing
one
*NL*
circumstance
that
could
make
me
less
desire
the
connection
.
--
Nothing
*NL*
has
proved
him
unworthy
;
nor
has
anything
declared
him
indifferent
to
*NL*
me
.
--
I
have
had
to
contend
against
the
unkindness
of
his
sister
,
and
*NL*
the
insolence
of
his
mother
;
and
have
suffered
the
punishment
of
an
*NL*
attachment
,
without
enjoying
its
advantages
.
--
And
all
this
has
been
*NL*
going
on
at
a
time
,
when
,
as
you
know
too
well
,
it
has
not
been
my
only
*NL*
unhappiness
.

If
you
can
think
me
capable
of
ever
feeling

surely
you
*NL*
may
suppose
that
I
have
suffered
NOW

The
composure
of
mind
with
which
*NL*
I
have
brought
myself
at
present
to
consider
the
matter
,
the
*NL*
consolation
that
I
have
been
willing
to
admit
,
have
been
the
effect
of
*NL*
constant
and
painful
exertion
;
--
they
did
not
spring
up
of
*NL*
themselves
;
--
they
did
not
occur
to
relieve
my
spirits
at
first
.
--
No
,
*NL*
Marianne
.
--
THEN
,
if
I
had
not
been
bound
to
silence
,
perhaps
nothing
*NL*
could
have
kept
me
entirely
--
not
even
what
I
owed
to
my
dearest
*NL*
friends
--
from
openly
shewing
that
I
was
VERY
unhappy
.
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
was
quite
subdued
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Elinor
,
''
she
cried
,
``
you
have
made
me
hate
myself
for
ever
.
--
How
*NL*
barbarous
have
I
been
to
you
!
--
you
,
who
have
been
my
only
comfort
,
who
*NL*
have
borne
with
me
in
all
my
misery
,
who
have
seemed
to
be
only
*NL*
suffering
for
me
!
--
Is
this
my
gratitude
?
--
Is
this
the
only
return
I
can
*NL*
make
you
?
--
Because
your
merit
cries
out
upon
myself
,
I
have
been
trying
*NL*
to
do
it
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tenderest
caresses
followed
this
confession
.
In
such
a
frame
of
*NL*
mind
as
she
was
now
in
,
Elinor
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
from
her
*NL*
whatever
promise
she
required
;
and
at
her
request
,
Marianne
engaged
*NL*
never
to
speak
of
the
affair
to
any
one
with
the
least
appearance
of
*NL*
bitterness
;
--
to
meet
Lucy
without
betraying
the
smallest
increase
of
*NL*
dislike
to
her
;
--
and
even
to
see
Edward
himself
,
if
chance
should
bring
*NL*
them
together
,
without
any
diminution
of
her
usual
cordiality
.
--
These
*NL*
were
great
concessions
;
--
but
where
Marianne
felt
that
she
had
injured
,
*NL*
no
reparation
could
be
too
much
for
her
to
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
performed
her
promise
of
being
discreet
,
to
admiration
.
--
She
*NL*
attended
to
all
that
Mrs.
Jennings
had
to
say
upon
the
subject
,
with
an
*NL*
unchanging
complexion
,
dissented
from
her
in
nothing
,
and
was
heard
*NL*
three
times
to
say
,
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
''
--
She
listened
to
her
praise
of
Lucy
*NL*
with
only
moving
from
one
chair
to
another
,
and
when
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
talked
of
Edward
's
affection
,
it
cost
her
only
a
spasm
in
her
*NL*
throat
.
--
Such
advances
towards
heroism
in
her
sister
,
made
Elinor
feel
*NL*
equal
to
any
thing
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
brought
a
farther
trial
of
it
,
in
a
visit
from
their
*NL*
brother
,
who
came
with
a
most
serious
aspect
to
talk
over
the
dreadful
*NL*
affair
,
and
bring
them
news
of
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
heard
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
he
with
great
solemnity
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
was
seated
,
``
of
the
very
shocking
discovery
that
took
place
under
*NL*
our
roof
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
looked
their
assent
;
it
seemed
too
awful
a
moment
for
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sister
,
''
he
continued
,
``
has
suffered
dreadfully
.
Mrs.
Ferrars
*NL*
too
--
in
short
it
has
been
a
scene
of
such
complicated
distress
--
but
I
*NL*
will
hope
that
the
storm
may
be
weathered
without
our
being
any
of
us
*NL*
quite
overcome
.
Poor
Fanny
!
she
was
in
hysterics
all
yesterday
.
But
I
*NL*
would
not
alarm
you
too
much
.
Donavan
says
there
is
nothing
materially
*NL*
to
be
apprehended
;
her
constitution
is
a
good
one
,
and
her
resolution
*NL*
equal
to
any
thing
.
She
has
borne
it
all
,
with
the
fortitude
of
an
*NL*
angel
!
She
says
she
never
shall
think
well
of
anybody
again
;
and
one
*NL*
can
not
wonder
at
it
,
after
being
so
deceived
!
--
meeting
with
such
*NL*
ingratitude
,
where
so
much
kindness
had
been
shewn
,
so
much
confidence
*NL*
had
been
placed
!
It
was
quite
out
of
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
,
*NL*
that
she
had
asked
these
young
women
to
her
house
;
merely
because
she
*NL*
thought
they
deserved
some
attention
,
were
harmless
,
well-behaved
*NL*
girls
,
and
would
be
pleasant
companions
;
for
otherwise
we
both
wished
*NL*
very
much
to
have
invited
you
and
Marianne
to
be
with
us
,
while
your
*NL*
kind
friend
there
,
was
attending
her
daughter
.
And
now
to
be
so
*NL*
rewarded
!
'
I
wish
,
with
all
my
heart
,
'
says
poor
Fanny
in
her
*NL*
affectionate
way
,
`
that
we
had
asked
your
sisters
instead
of
them
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
stopped
to
be
thanked
;
which
being
done
,
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
poor
Mrs.
Ferrars
suffered
,
when
first
Fanny
broke
it
to
her
,
is
*NL*
not
to
be
described
.
While
she
with
the
truest
affection
had
been
*NL*
planning
a
most
eligible
connection
for
him
,
was
it
to
be
supposed
that
*NL*
he
could
be
all
the
time
secretly
engaged
to
another
person
!
--
such
a
*NL*
suspicion
could
never
have
entered
her
head
!
If
she
suspected
ANY
*NL*
prepossession
elsewhere
,
it
could
not
be
in
THAT
quarter
.
`
THERE
,
to
*NL*
be
sure
,
'
said
she
,
'
I
might
have
thought
myself
safe
.
'
She
was
quite
*NL*
in
an
agony
.
We
consulted
together
,
however
,
as
to
what
should
be
*NL*
done
,
and
at
last
she
determined
to
send
for
Edward
.
He
came
.
But
I
*NL*
am
sorry
to
relate
what
ensued
.
All
that
Mrs.
Ferrars
could
say
to
*NL*
make
him
put
an
end
to
the
engagement
,
assisted
too
as
you
may
well
*NL*
suppose
by
my
arguments
,
and
Fanny
's
entreaties
,
was
of
no
avail
.
*NL*
Duty
,
affection
,
every
thing
was
disregarded
.
I
never
thought
Edward
*NL*
so
stubborn
,
so
unfeeling
before
.
His
mother
explained
to
him
her
*NL*
liberal
designs
,
in
case
of
his
marrying
Miss
Morton
;
told
him
she
*NL*
would
settle
on
him
the
Norfolk
estate
,
which
,
clear
of
land-tax
,
*NL*
brings
in
a
good
thousand
a-year
;
offered
even
,
when
matters
grew
*NL*
desperate
,
to
make
it
twelve
hundred
;
and
in
opposition
to
this
,
if
he
*NL*
still
persisted
in
this
low
connection
,
represented
to
him
the
certain
*NL*
penury
that
must
attend
the
match
.
His
own
two
thousand
pounds
she
*NL*
protested
should
be
his
all
;
she
would
never
see
him
again
;
and
so
far
*NL*
would
she
be
from
affording
him
the
smallest
assistance
,
that
if
he
*NL*
were
to
enter
into
any
profession
with
a
view
of
better
support
,
she
*NL*
would
do
all
in
her
power
to
prevent
him
advancing
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Marianne
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
indignation
,
clapped
her
hands
*NL*
together
,
and
cried
,
``
Gracious
God
!
can
this
be
possible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
may
you
wonder
,
Marianne
,
''
replied
her
brother
,
``
at
the
obstinacy
*NL*
which
could
resist
such
arguments
as
these
.
Your
exclamation
is
very
*NL*
natural
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
was
going
to
retort
,
but
she
remembered
her
promises
,
and
*NL*
forbore
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
,
however
,
''
he
continued
,
``
was
urged
in
vain
.
Edward
said
*NL*
very
little
;
but
what
he
did
say
,
was
in
the
most
determined
manner
.
*NL*
Nothing
should
prevail
on
him
to
give
up
his
engagement
.
He
would
*NL*
stand
to
it
,
cost
him
what
it
might
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Jennings
with
blunt
sincerity
,
no
longer
able
to
be
*NL*
silent
,
``
he
has
acted
like
an
honest
man
!
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
*NL*
Dashwood
,
but
if
he
had
done
otherwise
,
I
should
have
thought
him
a
*NL*
rascal
.
I
have
some
little
concern
in
the
business
,
as
well
as
*NL*
yourself
,
for
Lucy
Steele
is
my
cousin
,
and
I
believe
there
is
not
a
*NL*
better
kind
of
girl
in
the
world
,
nor
one
who
more
deserves
a
good
*NL*
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
John
Dashwood
was
greatly
astonished
;
but
his
nature
was
calm
,
not
open
*NL*
to
provocation
,
and
he
never
wished
to
offend
anybody
,
especially
*NL*
anybody
of
good
fortune
.
He
therefore
replied
,
without
any
resentment
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
by
no
means
speak
disrespectfully
of
any
relation
of
yours
,
*NL*
madam
.
Miss
Lucy
Steele
is
,
I
dare
say
,
a
very
deserving
young
woman
,
*NL*
but
in
the
present
case
you
know
,
the
connection
must
be
impossible
.
*NL*
And
to
have
entered
into
a
secret
engagement
with
a
young
man
under
her
*NL*
uncle
's
care
,
the
son
of
a
woman
especially
of
such
very
large
fortune
*NL*
as
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
is
perhaps
,
altogether
a
little
extraordinary
.
In
*NL*
short
,
I
do
not
mean
to
reflect
upon
the
behaviour
of
any
person
whom
*NL*
you
have
a
regard
for
,
Mrs.
Jennings
.
We
all
wish
her
extremely
happy
;
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
conduct
throughout
the
whole
,
has
been
such
as
every
*NL*
conscientious
,
good
mother
,
in
like
circumstances
,
would
adopt
.
It
has
*NL*
been
dignified
and
liberal
.
Edward
has
drawn
his
own
lot
,
and
I
fear
*NL*
it
will
be
a
bad
one

*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
sighed
out
her
similar
apprehension
;
and
Elinor
's
heart
wrung
*NL*
for
the
feelings
of
Edward
,
while
braving
his
mother
's
threats

for
a
*NL*
woman
who
could
not
reward
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Mrs.

how
did
it
end

I
am
sorry

where

Born

I
can
not
conceive
a
situation
more

deplorable

The
interest

how
can

it

not

Elinor

heart
thanked
her
for

concluded

Marianne

indignation
burst
forth

vehemence
made
reserve
impossible
in
Elinor
,

unnecessary
in

they
all
joined

spirited
critique

CHAPTER
38
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
was
very
warm
in
her
praise
of
Edward
's
conduct
,
but
only
*NL*
Elinor
and
Marianne
understood
its
true
merit
.
THEY
only
knew
how
*NL*
little
he
had
had
to
tempt
him
to
be
disobedient
,
and
how
small
was
the
*NL*
consolation
,
beyond
the
consciousness
of
doing
right
,
that
could
remain
*NL*
to
him
in
the
loss
of
friends
and
fortune
.
Elinor
gloried
in
his
*NL*
integrity
;
and
Marianne
forgave
all
his
offences
in
compassion
for
his
*NL*
punishment
.
But
though
confidence
between
them
was
,
by
this
public
*NL*
discovery
,
restored
to
its
proper
state
,
it
was
not
a
subject
on
which
*NL*
either
of
them
were
fond
of
dwelling
when
alone
.
Elinor
avoided
it
*NL*
upon
principle
,
as
tending
to
fix
still
more
upon
her
thoughts
,
by
the
*NL*
too
warm
,
too
positive
assurances
of
Marianne
,
that
belief
of
Edward
's
*NL*
continued
affection
for
herself
which
she
rather
wished
to
do
away
;
and
*NL*
Marianne
's
courage
soon
failed
her
,
in
trying
to
converse
upon
a
topic
*NL*
which
always
left
her
more
dissatisfied
with
herself
than
ever
,
by
the
*NL*
comparison
it
necessarily
produced
between
Elinor
's
conduct
and
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
all
the
force
of
that
comparison
;
but
not
as
her
sister
had
*NL*
hoped
,
to
urge
her
to
exertion
now
;
she
felt
it
with
all
the
pain
of
*NL*
continual
self-reproach
,
regretted
most
bitterly
that
she
had
never
*NL*
exerted
herself
before
;
but
it
brought
only
the
torture
of
penitence
,
*NL*
without
the
hope
of
amendment
.
Her
mind
was
so
much
weakened
that
she
*NL*
still
fancied
present
exertion
impossible
,
and
therefore
it
only
*NL*
dispirited
her
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
new
was
heard
by
them
,
for
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
of
affairs
*NL*
in
Harley
Street
,
or
Bartlett
's
Buildings
.
But
though
so
much
of
the
*NL*
matter
was
known
to
them
already
,
that
Mrs.
Jennings
might
have
had
*NL*
enough
to
do
in
spreading
that
knowledge
farther
,
without
seeking
after
*NL*
more
,
she
had
resolved
from
the
first
to
pay
a
visit
of
comfort
and
*NL*
inquiry
to
her
cousins
as
soon
as
she
could
;
and
nothing
but
the
*NL*
hindrance
of
more
visitors
than
usual
,
had
prevented
her
going
to
them
*NL*
within
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
day
succeeding
their
knowledge
of
the
particulars
,
was
so
*NL*
fine
,
so
beautiful
a
Sunday
as
to
draw
many
to
Kensington
Gardens
,
*NL*
though
it
was
only
the
second
week
in
March
.
Mrs.
Jennings
and
Elinor
*NL*
were
of
the
number
;
but
Marianne
,
who
knew
that
the
Willoughbys
were
*NL*
again
in
town
,
and
had
a
constant
dread
of
meeting
them
,
chose
rather
*NL*
to
stay
at
home
,
than
venture
into
so
public
a
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
intimate
acquaintance
of
Mrs.
Jennings
joined
them
soon
after
they
*NL*
entered
the
Gardens
,
and
Elinor
was
not
sorry
that
by
her
continuing
*NL*
with
them
,
and
engaging
all
Mrs.
Jennings
's
conversation
,
she
was
*NL*
herself
left
to
quiet
reflection
.
She
saw
nothing
of
the
Willoughbys
,
*NL*
nothing
of
Edward
,
and
for
some
time
nothing
of
anybody
who
could
by
*NL*
any
chance
whether
grave
or
gay
,
be
interesting
to
her
.
But
at
last
*NL*
she
found
herself
with
some
surprise
,
accosted
by
Miss
Steele
,
who
,
*NL*
though
looking
rather
shy
,
expressed
great
satisfaction
in
meeting
*NL*
them
,
and
on
receiving
encouragement
from
the
particular
kindness
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
,
left
her
own
party
for
a
short
time
,
to
join
their
's
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
immediately
whispered
to
Elinor
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
it
all
out
of
her
,
my
dear
.
She
will
tell
you
any
thing
if
you
*NL*
ask
.
You
see
I
can
not
leave
Mrs.
Clarke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
lucky
,
however
,
for
Mrs.
Jennings
's
curiosity
and
Elinor
's
too
,
*NL*
that
she
would
tell
any
thing
WITHOUT
being
asked
;
for
nothing
would
*NL*
otherwise
have
been
learnt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
to
meet
you
;
''
said
Miss
Steele
,
taking
her
familiarly
by
*NL*
the
arm
--
``
for
I
wanted
to
see
you
of
all
things
in
the
world
.
''
And
*NL*
then
lowering
her
voice
,
``
I
suppose
Mrs.
Jennings
has
heard
all
about
*NL*
it
.
Is
she
angry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
I
believe
,
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
good
thing
.
And
Lady
Middleton
,
is
SHE
angry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
suppose
it
possible
that
she
should
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
monstrous
glad
of
it
.
Good
gracious
!
I
have
had
such
a
time
of
*NL*
it
!
I
never
saw
Lucy
in
such
a
rage
in
my
life
.
She
vowed
at
first
*NL*
she
would
never
trim
me
up
a
new
bonnet
,
nor
do
any
thing
else
for
me
*NL*
again
,
so
long
as
she
lived
;
but
now
she
is
quite
come
to
,
and
we
are
*NL*
as
good
friends
as
ever
.
Look
,
she
made
me
this
bow
to
my
hat
,
and
put
*NL*
in
the
feather
last
night
.
There
now
,
YOU
are
going
to
laugh
at
me
*NL*
too
.
But
why
should
not
I
wear
pink
ribbons
?
I
do
not
care
if
it
IS
*NL*
the
Doctor
's
favourite
colour
.
I
am
sure
,
for
my
part
,
I
should
never
*NL*
have
known
he
DID
like
it
better
than
any
other
colour
,
if
he
had
not
*NL*
happened
to
say
so
.
My
cousins
have
been
so
plaguing
me
!
I
declare
*NL*
sometimes
I
do
not
know
which
way
to
look
before
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
wandered
away
to
a
subject
on
which
Elinor
had
nothing
to
say
,
*NL*
and
therefore
soon
judged
it
expedient
to
find
her
way
back
again
to
*NL*
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
Miss
Dashwood
,
''
speaking
triumphantly
,
``
people
may
say
what
*NL*
they
chuse
about
Mr.
Ferrars
's
declaring
he
would
not
have
Lucy
,
for
it
*NL*
is
no
such
thing
I
can
tell
you
;
and
it
is
quite
a
shame
for
such
*NL*
ill-natured
reports
to
be
spread
abroad
.
Whatever
Lucy
might
think
*NL*
about
it
herself
,
you
know
,
it
was
no
business
of
other
people
to
set
*NL*
it
down
for
certain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
heard
any
thing
of
the
kind
hinted
at
before
,
I
assure
you
,
''
*NL*
said
Elinor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
did
not
you
?
But
it
WAS
said
,
I
know
,
very
well
,
and
by
more
than
*NL*
one
;
for
Miss
Godby
told
Miss
Sparks
,
that
nobody
in
their
senses
could
*NL*
expect
Mr.
Ferrars
to
give
up
a
woman
like
Miss
Morton
,
with
thirty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
to
her
fortune
,
for
Lucy
Steele
that
had
nothing
at
*NL*
all
;
and
I
had
it
from
Miss
Sparks
myself
.
And
besides
that
,
my
cousin
*NL*
Richard
said
himself
,
that
when
it
came
to
the
point
he
was
afraid
Mr.
*NL*
Ferrars
would
be
off
;
and
when
Edward
did
not
come
near
us
for
three
*NL*
days
,
I
could
not
tell
what
to
think
myself
;
and
I
believe
in
my
heart
*NL*
Lucy
gave
it
up
all
for
lost
;
for
we
came
away
from
your
brother
's
*NL*
Wednesday
,
and
we
saw
nothing
of
him
not
all
Thursday
,
Friday
,
and
*NL*
Saturday
,
and
did
not
know
what
was
become
of
him
.
Once
Lucy
thought
*NL*
to
write
to
him
,
but
then
her
spirits
rose
against
that
.
However
this
*NL*
morning
he
came
just
as
we
came
home
from
church
;
and
then
it
all
came
*NL*
out
,
how
he
had
been
sent
for
Wednesday
to
Harley
Street
,
and
been
*NL*
talked
to
by
his
mother
and
all
of
them
,
and
how
he
had
declared
before
*NL*
them
all
that
he
loved
nobody
but
Lucy
,
and
nobody
but
Lucy
would
he
*NL*
have
.
And
how
he
had
been
so
worried
by
what
passed
,
that
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
had
went
away
from
his
mother
's
house
,
he
had
got
upon
his
horse
,
*NL*
and
rid
into
the
country
,
some
where
or
other
;
and
how
he
had
stayed
*NL*
about
at
an
inn
all
Thursday
and
Friday
,
on
purpose
to
get
the
better
*NL*
of
it
.
And
after
thinking
it
all
over
and
over
again
,
he
said
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
as
if
,
now
he
had
no
fortune
,
and
no
nothing
at
all
,
it
*NL*
would
be
quite
unkind
to
keep
her
on
to
the
engagement
,
because
it
must
*NL*
be
for
her
loss
,
for
he
had
nothing
but
two
thousand
pounds
,
and
no
*NL*
hope
of
any
thing
else
;
and
if
he
was
to
go
into
orders
,
as
he
had
some
*NL*
thoughts
,
he
could
get
nothing
but
a
curacy
,
and
how
was
they
to
live
*NL*
upon
that
?
--
He
could
not
bear
to
think
of
her
doing
no
better
,
and
so
*NL*
he
begged
,
if
she
had
the
least
mind
for
it
,
to
put
an
end
to
the
*NL*
matter
directly
,
and
leave
him
shift
for
himself
.
I
heard
him
say
all
*NL*
this
as
plain
as
could
possibly
be
.
And
it
was
entirely
for
HER
sake
,
*NL*
and
upon
HER
account
,
that
he
said
a
word
about
being
off
,
and
not
upon
*NL*
his
own
.
I
will
take
my
oath
he
never
dropt
a
syllable
of
being
tired
*NL*
of
her
,
or
of
wishing
to
marry
Miss
Morton
,
or
any
thing
like
it
.
But
,
*NL*
to
be
sure
,
Lucy
would
not
give
ear
to
such
kind
of
talking
;
so
she
*NL*
told
him
directly
-LRB-
with
a
great
deal
about
sweet
and
love
,
you
know
,
*NL*
and
all
that
--
Oh
,
la
!
one
ca
n't
repeat
such
kind
of
things
you
*NL*
know
-RRB-
--
she
told
him
directly
,
she
had
not
the
least
mind
in
the
world
*NL*
to
be
off
,
for
she
could
live
with
him
upon
a
trifle
,
and
how
little
so
*NL*
ever
he
might
have
,
she
should
be
very
glad
to
have
it
all
,
you
know
,
*NL*
or
something
of
the
kind
.
So
then
he
was
monstrous
happy
,
and
talked
*NL*
on
some
time
about
what
they
should
do
,
and
they
agreed
he
should
take
*NL*
orders
directly
,
and
they
must
wait
to
be
married
till
he
got
a
living
.
*NL*
And
just
then
I
could
not
hear
any
more
,
for
my
cousin
called
from
*NL*
below
to
tell
me
Mrs.
Richardson
was
come
in
her
coach
,
and
would
take
*NL*
one
of
us
to
Kensington
Gardens
;
so
I
was
forced
to
go
into
the
room
*NL*
and
interrupt
them
,
to
ask
Lucy
if
she
would
like
to
go
,
but
she
did
*NL*
not
care
to
leave
Edward
;
so
I
just
run
up
stairs
and
put
on
a
pair
of
*NL*
silk
stockings
and
came
off
with
the
Richardsons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
interrupting
them
,
''
said
Elinor
;
*NL*
``
you
were
all
in
the
same
room
together
,
were
not
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
not
us
.
La
!
Miss
Dashwood
,
do
you
think
people
make
love
*NL*
when
any
body
else
is
by
?
Oh
,
for
shame
!
--
To
be
sure
you
must
know
*NL*
better
than
that
.
-LRB-
Laughing
affectedly
.
-RRB-
--
No
,
no
;
they
were
shut
up
in
*NL*
the
drawing-room
together
,
and
all
I
heard
was
only
by
listening
at
the
*NL*
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
''
cried
Elinor
;
``
have
you
been
repeating
to
me
what
you
only
*NL*
learnt
yourself
by
listening
at
the
door
?
I
am
sorry
I
did
not
know
it
*NL*
before
;
for
I
certainly
would
not
have
suffered
you
to
give
me
*NL*
particulars
of
a
conversation
which
you
ought
not
to
have
known
*NL*
yourself
.
How
could
you
behave
so
unfairly
by
your
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
la
!
there
is
nothing
in
THAT
.
I
only
stood
at
the
door
,
and
heard
*NL*
what
I
could
.
And
I
am
sure
Lucy
would
have
done
just
the
same
by
me
;
*NL*
for
a
year
or
two
back
,
when
Martha
Sharpe
and
I
had
so
many
secrets
*NL*
together
,
she
never
made
any
bones
of
hiding
in
a
closet
,
or
behind
a
*NL*
chimney-board
,
on
purpose
to
hear
what
we
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
tried
to
talk
of
something
else
;
but
Miss
Steele
could
not
be
*NL*
kept
beyond
a
couple
of
minutes
,
from
what
was
uppermost
in
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edward
talks
of
going
to
Oxford
soon
,
''
said
she
;
``
but
now
he
is
*NL*
lodging
at
No
.
--
,
Pall
Mall
.
What
an
ill-natured
woman
his
mother
is
,
*NL*
a
n't
she
?
And
your
brother
and
sister
were
not
very
kind
!
However
,
I
*NL*
sha
n't
say
anything
against
them
to
YOU
;
and
to
be
sure
they
did
send
*NL*
us
home
in
their
own
chariot
,
which
was
more
than
I
looked
for
.
And
*NL*
for
my
part
,
I
was
all
in
a
fright
for
fear
your
sister
should
ask
us
*NL*
for
the
huswifes
she
had
gave
us
a
day
or
two
before
;
but
,
however
,
*NL*
nothing
was
said
about
them
,
and
I
took
care
to
keep
mine
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
Edward
have
got
some
business
at
Oxford
,
he
says
;
so
he
must
go
there
*NL*
for
a
time

and
after
THAT
,
as
soon
as
he
can
light
upon
a
Bishop
,
he
*NL*
will
be
ordained
.
I
wonder
what
curacy
he
will
get
!
--
Good
gracious
!
*NL*
-LRB-
giggling
as
she
spoke
-RRB-
I
'd
lay
my
life
I
know
what
my
cousins
will
*NL*
say
,
when
they
hear
of

They
will
tell
me
I
should
write

Doctor

get
Edward
the
curacy
of
his
new

I

such
a

shall
say
directly

``
Well

Elinor
,
``
it

comfort

*NL*
Miss
Steele
was
going
to
reply
on
the

subject
,
but
the
approach
of
*NL*
her
own
party
made
another
more
necessary
.

*NL*
``
Oh
,
la
!
here
come
the
Richardsons
.
I
had
a
vast
deal
more
to
say
to
*NL*
you
,
but
I
must
not
stay
away
from
them
not
any
longer
.
I
assure
you
*NL*
they
are
very
genteel
people
.
He
makes
a
monstrous
deal
of
money
,
and
*NL*
they
keep
their
own
coach
.
I
have
not
time
to
speak
to
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
about
it
myself
,
but
pray
tell
her
I
am
quite
happy
to
hear
she
is
not
*NL*
in
anger
against
us
,
and
Lady
Middleton
the
same
;
and
if
anything
*NL*
should
happen
to
take
you
and
your
sister
away
,
and
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
should
want
company
,
I
am
sure
we
should
be
very
glad
to
come
and
stay
*NL*
with
her
for
as
long
a
time
as
she
likes
.
I
suppose
Lady
Middleton
*NL*
wo
n't
ask
us
any
more
this
bout
.
Good-by
;
I
am
sorry
Miss
Marianne
was
*NL*
not
here
.
Remember
me
kindly
to
her
.
La
!
if
you
have
not
got
your
*NL*
spotted
muslin
on
!
--
I
wonder
you
was
not
afraid
of
its
being
torn
.

*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
her
parting
concern
;
for
after
this
,
she
had
time
only
to
pay
*NL*
her
farewell
compliments
to
Mrs.
Jennings
,
before
her
company
was
*NL*
claimed
by
Mrs.
Richardson
;
and
Elinor
was
left
in
possession
of
*NL*
knowledge
which
might
feed
her
powers
of
reflection
some
time
,
though
*NL*
she
had
learnt
very
little
more
than
what
had
been
already
foreseen
and
*NL*
foreplanned
in
her
own
mind
.
Edward
's
marriage
with
Lucy
was
as
firmly
*NL*
determined
on
,
and
the
time
of
its
taking
place
remained
as
absolutely
*NL*
uncertain
,
as
she
had
concluded
it
would
be
;
--
every
thing
depended
,
*NL*
exactly
after
her
expectation
,
on
his
getting
that
preferment
,
of
*NL*
which
,
at
present
,
there
seemed
not
the
smallest
chance
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
returned
to
the
carriage
,
Mrs.
Jennings
was
eager
for
*NL*
information
;
but
as
Elinor
wished
to
spread
as
little
as
possible
*NL*
intelligence
that
had
in
the
first
place
been
so
unfairly
obtained
,
she
*NL*
confined
herself
to
the
brief
repetition
of
such
simple
particulars
,
as
*NL*
she
felt
assured
that
Lucy
,
for
the
sake
of
her
own
consequence
,
would
*NL*
choose
to
have
known
.
The
continuance
of
their
engagement
,
and
the
*NL*
means
that
were
able
to
be
taken
for
promoting
its
end
,
was
all
her
*NL*
communication
;
and
this
produced
from
Mrs.
Jennings
the
following
*NL*
natural
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
for
his
having
a
living
!
--
ay
,
we
all
know
how
THAT
will
*NL*
end
:
--
they
will
wait
a
twelvemonth
,
and
finding
no
good
comes
of
it
,
*NL*
will
set
down
upon
a
curacy
of
fifty
pounds
a-year
,
with
the
interest
*NL*
of
his
two
thousand
pounds
,
and
what
little
matter
Mr.
Steele
and
Mr.
*NL*
Pratt
can
give
her
.
--
Then
they
will
have
a
child
every
year
!
and
Lord
*NL*
help
'em
!
how
poor
they
will
be
!
--
I
must
see
what
I
can
give
them
*NL*
towards
furnishing
their
house
.
Two
maids
and
two
men
,
indeed
!
--
as
I
*NL*
talked
of
t
`
other
day
.
--
No
,
no
,
they
must
get
a
stout
girl
of
all
*NL*
works
.
--
Betty
's
sister
would
never
do
for
them
NOW

*NL*
The
next
morning
brought
Elinor
a
letter
by
the
two-penny
post
from
*NL*
Lucy
herself
.
It
was
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bartlett
's
Building

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
my
dear
Miss
Dashwood
will
excuse
the
*NL*
liberty
I
take
of
writing
to
her
;
but
I
know
your
*NL*
friendship
for
me
will
make
you
pleased
to
hear
such
*NL*
a
good
account
of
myself
and
my
dear
Edward
,
after
*NL*
all
the
troubles
we
have
went
through
lately
,
*NL*
therefore
will
make
no
more
apologies
,
but
proceed
*NL*
to
say
that
,
thank
God
!
though
we
have
suffered
*NL*
dreadfully
,
we
are
both
quite
well
now
,
and
as
happy
*NL*
as
we
must
always
be
in
one
another
's
love
.
We
have
*NL*
had
great
trials
,
and
great
persecutions
,
but
*NL*
however
,
at
the
same
time
,
gratefully
acknowledge
*NL*
many
friends
,
yourself
not
the
least
among
them
,
*NL*
whose
great
kindness
I
shall
always
thankfully
*NL*
remember
,
as
will
Edward
too
,
who
I
have
told
of
*NL*
it
.
I
am
sure
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
,
as
likewise
*NL*
dear
Mrs.
Jennings
,
I
spent
two
happy
hours
with
*NL*
him
yesterday
afternoon
,
he
would
not
hear
of
our
*NL*
parting
,
though
earnestly
did
I
,
as
I
thought
my
*NL*
duty
required
,
urge
him
to
it
for
prudence
sake
,
*NL*
and
would
have
parted
for
ever
on
the
spot
,
would
*NL*
he
consent
to
it
;
but
he
said
it
should
never
be
,
*NL*
he
did
not
regard
his
mother
's
anger
,
while
he
could
*NL*
have
my
affections
;
our
prospects
are
not
very
*NL*
bright
,
to
be
sure
,
but
we
must
wait
,
and
hope
for
*NL*
the
best
;
he
will
be
ordained
shortly
;
and
should
*NL*
it
ever
be
in
your
power
to
recommend
him
to
any
*NL*
body
that
has
a
living
to
bestow
,
am
very
sure
you
*NL*
will
not
forget
us
,
and
dear
Mrs.
Jennings
too
,
*NL*
trust
she
will
speak
a
good
word
for
us
to
Sir
John
,
*NL*
or
Mr.
Palmer
,
or
any
friend
that
may
be
able
to
*NL*
assist
us
.
--
Poor
Anne
was
much
to
blame
for
what
*NL*
she
did
,
but
she
did
it
for
the
best
,
so
I
say
*NL*
nothing
;
hope
Mrs.
Jennings
wo
n't
think
it
too
much
*NL*
trouble
to
give
us
a
call
,
should
she
come
this
way
*NL*
any
morning
,
`
twould
be
a
great
kindness
,
and
my

cousins
would
be
proud
to

My
paper
reminds
*NL*
me
to
conclude
;
and
begging
to
be
most
gratefully
*NL*
and
respectfully
remembered
to
her

and
to
Sir
John

*NL*

As
soon
as
Elinor
had
finished
it
,
she
performed
what
she
concluded
to
*NL*
be
its
writer
's
real
design
,
by
placing
it
in
the
hands
of
Mrs.

Jennings

who
read
it
aloud
with
many
comments
of
satisfaction

praise

*NL*
``
Very

CHAPTER
39
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Dashwoods
had
now
been
rather
more
than
two
months
in
town
,
*NL*
and
Marianne
's
impatience
to
be
gone
increased
every
day
.
She
sighed
*NL*
for
the
air
,
the
liberty
,
the
quiet
of
the
country
;
and
fancied
that
if
*NL*
any
place
could
give
her
ease
,
Barton
must
do
it
.
Elinor
was
hardly
*NL*
less
anxious
than
herself
for
their
removal
,
and
only
so
much
less
bent
*NL*
on
its
being
effected
immediately
,
as
that
she
was
conscious
of
the
*NL*
difficulties
of
so
long
a
journey
,
which
Marianne
could
not
be
brought
*NL*
to
acknowledge
.
She
began
,
however
,
seriously
to
turn
her
thoughts
*NL*
towards
its
accomplishment
,
and
had
already
mentioned
their
wishes
to
*NL*
their
kind
hostess
,
who
resisted
them
with
all
the
eloquence
of
her
*NL*
good-will
,
when
a
plan
was
suggested
,
which
,
though
detaining
them
from
*NL*
home
yet
a
few
weeks
longer
,
appeared
to
Elinor
altogether
much
more
*NL*
eligible
than
any
other
.
The
Palmers
were
to
remove
to
Cleveland
about
*NL*
the
end
of
March
,
for
the
Easter
holidays
;
and
Mrs.
Jennings
,
with
both
*NL*
her
friends
,
received
a
very
warm
invitation
from
Charlotte
to
go
with
*NL*
them
.
This
would
not
,
in
itself
,
have
been
sufficient
for
the
delicacy
*NL*
of
Miss
Dashwood
;
--
but
it
was
inforced
with
so
much
real
politeness
by
*NL*
Mr.
Palmer
himself
,
as
,
joined
to
the
very
great
amendment
of
his
*NL*
manners
towards
them
since
her
sister
had
been
known
to
be
unhappy
,
*NL*
induced
her
to
accept
it
with
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
told
Marianne
what
she
had
done
,
however
,
her
first
reply
was
*NL*
not
very
auspicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cleveland
!
''
--
she
cried
,
with
great
agitation
.
``
No
,
I
can
not
go
to
*NL*
Cleveland
.
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forget
,
''
said
Elinor
gently
,
``
that
its
situation
is
not
...
that
it
*NL*
is
not
in
the
neighbourhood
of
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
in
Somersetshire
.
--
I
can
not
go
into
Somersetshire
.
--
There
,
*NL*
where
I
looked
forward
to
going
...
No
,
Elinor
,
you
can
not
expect
me
to
*NL*
go
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
would
not
argue
upon
the
propriety
of
overcoming
such
*NL*
feelings
;
--
she
only
endeavoured
to
counteract
them
by
working
on
*NL*
others
;
--
represented
it
,
therefore
,
as
a
measure
which
would
fix
the
*NL*
time
of
her
returning
to
that
dear
mother
,
whom
she
so
much
wished
to
*NL*
see
,
in
a
more
eligible
,
more
comfortable
manner
,
than
any
other
plan
*NL*
could
do
,
and
perhaps
without
any
greater
delay
.
From
Cleveland
,
which
*NL*
was
within
a
few
miles
of
Bristol
,
the
distance
to
Barton
was
not
*NL*
beyond
one
day
,
though
a
long
day
's
journey
;
and
their
mother
's
servant
*NL*
might
easily
come
there
to
attend
them
down
;
and
as
there
could
be
no
*NL*
occasion
of
their
staying
above
a
week
at
Cleveland
,
they
might
now
be
*NL*
at
home
in
little
more
than
three
weeks
'
time
.
As
Marianne
's
affection
*NL*
for
her
mother
was
sincere
,
it
must
triumph
with
little
difficulty
,
*NL*
over
the
imaginary
evils
she
had
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
was
so
far
from
being
weary
of
her
guests
,
that
she
*NL*
pressed
them
very
earnestly
to
return
with
her
again
from
Cleveland
.
*NL*
Elinor
was
grateful
for
the
attention
,
but
it
could
not
alter
her
*NL*
design
;
and
their
mother
's
concurrence
being
readily
gained
,
every
*NL*
thing
relative
to
their
return
was
arranged
as
far
as
it
could
be
;
--
and
*NL*
Marianne
found
some
relief
in
drawing
up
a
statement
of
the
hours
that
*NL*
were
yet
to
divide
her
from
Barton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Colonel
,
I
do
not
know
what
you
and
I
shall
do
without
the
Miss
*NL*
Dashwoods
;
''
--
was
Mrs.
Jennings
's
address
to
him
when
he
first
called
on
*NL*
her
,
after
their
leaving
her
was
settled
--
``
for
they
are
quite
resolved
*NL*
upon
going
home
from
the
Palmers
;
--
and
how
forlorn
we
shall
be
,
when
I
*NL*
come
back
!
--
Lord
!
we
shall
sit
and
gape
at
one
another
as
dull
as
two
*NL*
cats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
Mrs.
Jennings
was
in
hopes
,
by
this
vigorous
sketch
of
their
*NL*
future
ennui
,
to
provoke
him
to
make
that
offer
,
which
might
give
*NL*
himself
an
escape
from
it
;
--
and
if
so
,
she
had
soon
afterwards
good
*NL*
reason
to
think
her
object
gained
;
for
,
on
Elinor
's
moving
to
the
*NL*
window
to
take
more
expeditiously
the
dimensions
of
a
print
,
which
she
*NL*
was
going
to
copy
for
her
friend
,
he
followed
her
to
it
with
a
look
of
*NL*
particular
meaning
,
and
conversed
with
her
there
for
several
minutes
.
*NL*
The
effect
of
his
discourse
on
the
lady
too
,
could
not
escape
her
*NL*
observation
,
for
though
she
was
too
honorable
to
listen
,
and
had
even
*NL*
changed
her
seat
,
on
purpose
that
she
might
NOT
hear
,
to
one
close
by
*NL*
the
piano
forte
on
which
Marianne
was
playing
,
she
could
not
keep
*NL*
herself
from
seeing
that
Elinor
changed
colour
,
attended
with
*NL*
agitation
,
and
was
too
intent
on
what
he
said
to
pursue
her
*NL*
employment
.
--
Still
farther
in
confirmation
of
her
hopes
,
in
the
*NL*
interval
of
Marianne
's
turning
from
one
lesson
to
another
,
some
words
*NL*
of
the
Colonel
's
inevitably
reached
her
ear
,
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
*NL*
apologising
for
the
badness
of
his
house
.
This
set
the
matter
beyond
a
*NL*
doubt
.
She
wondered
,
indeed
,
at
his
thinking
it
necessary
to
do
so
;
*NL*
but
supposed
it
to
be
the
proper
etiquette
.
What
Elinor
said
in
reply
*NL*
she
could
not
distinguish
,
but
judged
from
the
motion
of
her
lips
,
that
*NL*
she
did
not
think
THAT
any
material
objection
;
--
and
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
commended
her
in
her
heart
for
being
so
honest
.
They
then
talked
on
*NL*
for
a
few
minutes
longer
without
her
catching
a
syllable
,
when
another
*NL*
lucky
stop
in
Marianne
's
performance
brought
her
these
words
in
the
*NL*
Colonel
's
calm
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
it
can
not
take
place
very
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Astonished
and
shocked
at
so
unlover-like
a
speech
,
she
was
almost
*NL*
ready
to
cry
out
,
``
Lord
!
what
should
hinder
it
?
''
--
but
checking
her
*NL*
desire
,
confined
herself
to
this
silent
ejaculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
very
strange
!
--
sure
he
need
not
wait
to
be
older
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
delay
on
the
Colonel
's
side
,
however
,
did
not
seem
to
offend
or
*NL*
mortify
his
fair
companion
in
the
least
,
for
on
their
breaking
up
the
*NL*
conference
soon
afterwards
,
and
moving
different
ways
,
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
very
plainly
heard
Elinor
say
,
and
with
a
voice
which
shewed
her
to
*NL*
feel
what
she
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
always
think
myself
very
much
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
was
delighted
with
her
gratitude
,
and
only
wondered
that
*NL*
after
hearing
such
a
sentence
,
the
Colonel
should
be
able
to
take
leave
*NL*
of
them
,
as
he
immediately
did
,
with
the
utmost
sang-froid
,
and
go
away
*NL*
without
making
her
any
reply
!
--
She
had
not
thought
her
old
friend
could
*NL*
have
made
so
indifferent
a
suitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
really
passed
between
them
was
to
this
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
,
''
said
he
,
with
great
compassion
,
``
of
the
injustice
your
*NL*
friend
Mr.
Ferrars
has
suffered
from
his
family
;
for
if
I
understand
*NL*
the
matter
right
,
he
has
been
entirely
cast
off
by
them
for
persevering
*NL*
in
his
engagement
with
a
very
deserving
young
woman
.
--
Have
I
been
*NL*
rightly
informed
?
--
Is
it
so
?
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
told
him
that
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cruelty
,
the
impolitic
cruelty
,
''
--
he
replied
,
with
great
*NL*
feeling
,
--
``
of
dividing
,
or
attempting
to
divide
,
two
young
people
long
*NL*
attached
to
each
other
,
is
terrible
.
--
Mrs.
Ferrars
does
not
know
what
*NL*
she
may
be
doing
--
what
she
may
drive
her
son
to
.
I
have
seen
Mr.
*NL*
Ferrars
two
or
three
times
in
Harley
Street
,
and
am
much
pleased
with
*NL*
him
.
He
is
not
a
young
man
with
whom
one
can
be
intimately
acquainted
*NL*
in
a
short
time
,
but
I
have
seen
enough
of
him
to
wish
him
well
for
his
*NL*
own
sake
,
and
as
a
friend
of
yours
,
I
wish
it
still
more
.
I
understand
*NL*
that
he
intends
to
take
orders
.
Will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
him
*NL*
that
the
living
of
Delaford
,
now
just
vacant
,
as
I
am
informed
by
this
*NL*
day
's
post
,
is
his
,
if
he
think
it
worth
his
acceptance
--
but
THAT
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
so
unfortunately
circumstanced
as
he
is
now
,
it
may
be
*NL*
nonsense
to
appear
to
doubt
;
I
only
wish
it
were
more
valuable
.
--
It
*NL*
is
a
rectory
,
but
a
small
one
;
the
late
incumbent
,
I
believe
,
did
not
*NL*
make
more
than
200
L
per
annum
,
and
though
it
is
certainly
capable
of
*NL*
improvement
,
I
fear
,
not
to
such
an
amount
as
to
afford
him
a
very
*NL*
comfortable
income
.
Such
as
it
is
,
however
,
my
pleasure
in
presenting
*NL*
it
to
him
,
will
be
very
great
.
Pray
assure
him
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
astonishment
at
this
commission
could
hardly
have
been
*NL*
greater
,
had
the
Colonel
been
really
making
her
an
offer
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
The
preferment
,
which
only
two
days
before
she
had
considered
as
*NL*
hopeless
for
Edward
,
was
already
provided
to
enable
him
to
marry
;
--
and
*NL*
SHE
,
of
all
people
in
the
world
,
was
fixed
on
to
bestow
it
!
--
Her
*NL*
emotion
was
such
as
Mrs.
Jennings
had
attributed
to
a
very
different
*NL*
cause
;
--
but
whatever
minor
feelings
less
pure
,
less
pleasing
,
might
*NL*
have
a
share
in
that
emotion
,
her
esteem
for
the
general
benevolence
,
*NL*
and
her
gratitude
for
the
particular
friendship
,
which
together
*NL*
prompted
Colonel
Brandon
to
this
act
,
were
strongly
felt
,
and
warmly
*NL*
expressed
.
She
thanked
him
for
it
with
all
her
heart
,
spoke
of
*NL*
Edward
's
principles
and
disposition
with
that
praise
which
she
knew
*NL*
them
to
deserve
;
and
promised
to
undertake
the
commission
with
*NL*
pleasure
,
if
it
were
really
his
wish
to
put
off
so
agreeable
an
office
*NL*
to
another
.
But
at
the
same
time
,
she
could
not
help
thinking
that
no
*NL*
one
could
so
well
perform
it
as
himself
.
It
was
an
office
in
short
,
*NL*
from
which
,
unwilling
to
give
Edward
the
pain
of
receiving
an
*NL*
obligation
from
HER
,
she
would
have
been
very
glad
to
be
spared
*NL*
herself
;
--
but
Colonel
Brandon
,
on
motives
of
equal
delicacy
,
declining
*NL*
it
likewise
,
still
seemed
so
desirous
of
its
being
given
through
her
*NL*
means
,
that
she
would
not
on
any
account
make
farther
opposition
.
*NL*
Edward
,
she
believed
,
was
still
in
town
,
and
fortunately
she
had
heard
*NL*
his
address
from
Miss
Steele
.
She
could
undertake
therefore
to
inform
*NL*
him
of
it
,
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
After
this
had
been
settled
,
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
began
to
talk
of
his
own
advantage
in
securing
so
*NL*
respectable
and
agreeable
a
neighbour
,
and
THEN
it
was
that
he
*NL*
mentioned
with
regret
,
that
the
house
was
small
and
indifferent
;
--
an
*NL*
evil
which
Elinor
,
as
Mrs.
Jennings
had
supposed
her
to
do
,
made
very
*NL*
light
of
,
at
least
as
far
as
regarded
its
size
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
smallness
of
the
house
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
can
not
imagine
any
*NL*
inconvenience
to
them
,
for
it
will
be
in
proportion
to
their
family
and
*NL*
income
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
which
the
Colonel
was
surprised
to
find
that
SHE
was
considering
Mr.
*NL*
Ferrars
's
marriage
as
the
certain
consequence
of
the
presentation
;
for
*NL*
he
did
not
suppose
it
possible
that
Delaford
living
could
supply
such
*NL*
an
income
,
as
anybody
in
his
style
of
life
would
venture
to
settle
*NL*
on
--
and
he
said
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
little
rectory
CAN
do
no
more
than
make
Mr.
Ferrars
comfortable
*NL*
as
a
bachelor
;
it
can
not
enable
him
to
marry
.
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
*NL*
my
patronage
ends
with
this
;
and
my
interest
is
hardly
more
extensive
.
*NL*
If
,
however
,
by
an
unforeseen
chance
it
should
be
in
my
power
to
serve
*NL*
him
farther
,
I
must
think
very
differently
of
him
from
what
I
now
do
,
*NL*
if
I
am
not
as
ready
to
be
useful
to
him
then
as
I
sincerely
wish
I
*NL*
could
be
at
present
.
What
I
am
now
doing
indeed
,
seems
nothing
at
all
,
*NL*
since
it
can
advance
him
so
little
towards
what
must
be
his
principal
,
*NL*
his
only
object
of
happiness
.
His
marriage
must
still
be
a
distant
*NL*
good
;
--
at
least
,
I
am
afraid
it
can
not
take
place
very
soon
.
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
sentence
which
,
when
misunderstood
,
so
justly
offended
the
*NL*
delicate
feelings
of
Mrs.
Jennings
;
but
after
this
narration
of
what
*NL*
really
passed
between
Colonel
Brandon
and
Elinor
,
while
they
stood
at
*NL*
the
window
,
the
gratitude
expressed
by
the
latter
on
their
parting
,
may
*NL*
perhaps
appear
in
general
,
not
less
reasonably
excited
,
nor
less
*NL*
properly
worded
than
if
it
had
arisen
from
an
offer
of
marriage
.

CHAPTER
40
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Miss
Dashwood
,
''
said
Mrs.
Jennings
,
sagaciously
smiling
,
as
soon
*NL*
as
the
gentleman
had
withdrawn
,
``
I
do
not
ask
you
what
the
Colonel
has

been
saying
to
you

honour
,
I
TRIED
to
keep
out
of

hearing
,
I
could
not
help
catching
enough
to
understand
his
business

*NL*
And
I
assure
you
I
never
was
better
pleased
in

life

I
wish
you

joy
of
it

heart

*NL*
``
Thank
you

Elinor

It
is
a
matter
of
great
joy
to
me
;
*NL*
and
I
feel
the
goodness
of
Colonel
Brandon
most
sensibly
.
There
are
*NL*
not
many
men
who
would
act

he
has
done

Few
people

have
so

compassionate

are

modest

I
a
n't
the
least
astonished
at
it
*NL*
in
the
world

for
I
have
often
thought
of
late
,
there
was
nothing
more
*NL*
likely
to
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
judged
from
your
knowledge
of
the
Colonel

general
benevolence

at

you
could
not
foresee
that
the
opportunity
would
so
very
*NL*
soon
occur

*NL*
``
Opportunity
!

Mrs.
Jennings
--
``
Oh
!
as
to
that
,
when
a
man
has

once
made
up
his
mind
to
such
a
thing

somehow
or
other
he
will
soon
*NL*
find
an
opportunity

Well
,
my
dear

I
wish
you
joy
of
it
again

*NL*
again
;
and
if
ever
there
was
a
happy
couple
in

world

I
think
I
*NL*
shall
soon
know
where
to
look

``

mean

go

with

faint
smile

*NL*
``

my
dear
,
that
I
do

indeed

as
to
the
house
being
a
bad
one

I
do
not
know
what

good
a
one

ever
I
saw

spoke

being
out

why
do

repair

who
should
do

it
but
himself

*NL*
*NL*
They
were
interrupted
by
the
servant
's
coming
in
to
announce
the
*NL*
carriage
being
at
the
door
;
and
Mrs.
Jennings
immediately
preparing
to

go
,
said
,

*NL*
``
Well

quite
alone

I
do
not
ask
you

I
dare
say
your
mind

full

*NL*
long
to
tell

sister
all
about

had
left

room
before
the
conversation
began

``
Certainly
,
ma'am

I
shall
tell
Marianne
of
it

I
shall
not
mention

it

present
to
any
body
else

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
very
well

said
Mrs.
Jennings
rather
disappointed
.
``
Then
you
*NL*
would
not
have
me
tell
it
to

I
think
of
going
as
far

Holborn
to-day

``
No

not
even

One
day

delay
will
not
be

very
material

till
I
have
written
to
Mr.
Ferrars
,
I
think
it
ought
*NL*
not
to
be
mentioned
to
any
body
else

I
shall
do
THAT
directly
.
It
is
*NL*
of
importance
that
no
time
should
be
lost
with
him
,
for
he
will
of
*NL*
course
have
much
to
do
relative
to
his
ordination

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
speech
at
first
puzzled
Mrs.
Jennings
exceedingly
.
Why
Mr.
*NL*
Ferrars
was
to
have
been
written
to
about
it
in
such
a
hurry
,
she
could
*NL*
not
immediately
comprehend
.
A
few
moments
'
reflection
,
however
,
*NL*
produced
a
very
happy
idea
,
and
she
exclaimed
;
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
ho
!
--
I
understand
you
.
Mr.
Ferrars
is
to
be
the
man
.
Well
,
so
*NL*
much
the
better
for
him
.
Ay
,
to
be
sure
,
he
must
be
ordained
in
*NL*
readiness
;
and
I
am
very
glad
to
find
things
are
so
forward
between
*NL*
you
.
But
,
my
dear
,
is
not
this
rather
out
of
character
?
Should
not
*NL*
the
Colonel
write
himself
?
--
sure
,
he
is
the
proper
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
did
not
quite
understand
the
beginning
of
Mrs.
Jennings
's
*NL*
speech
,
neither
did
she
think
it
worth
inquiring
into
;
and
therefore
*NL*
only
replied
to
its
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
Brandon
is
so
delicate
a
man
,
that
he
rather
wished
any
one
to
*NL*
announce
his
intentions
to
Mr.
Ferrars
than
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
YOU
are
forced
to
do
it
.
Well
THAT
is
an
odd
kind
of
delicacy
!
*NL*
However
,
I
will
not
disturb
you
-LRB-
seeing
her
preparing
to
write
.
-RRB-
You
*NL*
know
your
own
concerns
best
.
So
goodby
,
my
dear

I
have
not
heard
of
*NL*
any
thing
to
please
me
so
well
since
Charlotte
was
brought
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
away
she
went
;
but
returning
again
in
a
moment
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
been
thinking
of
Betty
's
sister
,
my
dear

I
should
be
*NL*
very
glad
to
get
her
so
good
a
mistress
.
But
whether
she
would
do
for
*NL*
a
lady
's
maid
,
I
am
sure
I
ca
n't
tell
.
She
is
an
excellent
housemaid
,
*NL*
and
works
very
well
at
her
needle
.
However
,
you
will
think
of
all
that
*NL*
at
your
leisure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
ma'am

''
replied
Elinor
,
not
hearing
much
of
what
she
said
,
*NL*
and
more
anxious
to
be
alone
,
than
to
be
mistress
of
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
she
should
begin
--
how
she
should
express
herself
in
her
note
to
*NL*
Edward
,
was
now
all
her
concern
.
The
particular
circumstances
between
*NL*
them
made
a
difficulty
of
that
which
to
any
other
person
would
have
*NL*
been
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
;
but
she
equally
feared
to
say
too
*NL*
much
or
too
little
,
and
sat
deliberating
over
her
paper
,
with
the
pen
*NL*
in
her
hand
,
till
broken
in
on
by
the
entrance
of
Edward
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
met
Mrs.
Jennings
at
the
door
in
her
way
to
the
carriage
,
as
he
*NL*
came
to
leave
his
farewell
card
;
and
she
,
after
apologising
for
not
*NL*
returning
herself
,
had
obliged
him
to
enter
,
by
saying
that
Miss
*NL*
Dashwood
was
above
,
and
wanted
to
speak
with
him
on
very
particular
*NL*
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
had
just
been
congratulating
herself
,
in
the
midst
of
her
*NL*
perplexity
,
that
however
difficult
it
might
be
to
express
herself
*NL*
properly
by
letter
,
it
was
at
least
preferable
to
giving
the
*NL*
information
by
word
of
mouth
,
when
her
visitor
entered
,
to
force
her
*NL*
upon
this
greatest
exertion
of
all
.
Her
astonishment
and
confusion
*NL*
were
very
great
on
his
so
sudden
appearance
.
She
had
not
seen
him
*NL*
before
since
his
engagement
became
public
,
and
therefore
not
since
his
*NL*
knowing
her
to
be
acquainted
with
it
;
which
,
with
the
consciousness
of
*NL*
what
she
had
been
thinking
of
,
and
what
she
had
to
tell
him
,
made
her
*NL*
feel
particularly
uncomfortable
for
some
minutes
.
He
too
was
much
*NL*
distressed
;
and
they
sat
down
together
in
a
most
promising
state
of
*NL*
embarrassment
.
--
Whether
he
had
asked
her
pardon
for
his
intrusion
on
*NL*
first
coming
into
the
room
,
he
could
not
recollect
;
but
determining
to
*NL*
be
on
the
safe
side
,
he
made
his
apology
in
form
as
soon
as
he
could
*NL*
say
any
thing
,
after
taking
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Jennings
told
me
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
you
wished
to
speak
with
me
,
at
*NL*
least
I
understood
her
so
--
or
I
certainly
should
not
have
intruded
on
*NL*
you
in
such
a
manner
;
though
at
the
same
time
,
I
should
have
been
*NL*
extremely
sorry
to
leave
London
without
seeing
you
and
your
sister
;
*NL*
especially
as
it
will
most
likely
be
some
time
--
it
is
not
probable
that
*NL*
I
should
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
again
.
I
go
to
Oxford
*NL*
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
not
have
gone
,
however
,
''
said
Elinor
,
recovering
herself
,
*NL*
and
determined
to
get
over
what
she
so
much
dreaded
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
,
``
without
receiving
our
good
wishes
,
even
if
we
had
not
been
*NL*
able
to
give
them
in
person
.
Mrs.
Jennings
was
quite
right
in
what
she
*NL*
said
.
I
have
something
of
consequence
to
inform
you
of
,
which
I
was
on
*NL*
the
point
of
communicating
by
paper
.
I
am
charged
with
a
most
*NL*
agreeable
office
-LRB-
breathing
rather
faster
than
usual
as
she
spoke
.
-RRB-
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
,
who
was
here
only
ten
minutes
ago
,
has
desired
me
to
*NL*
say
,
that
understanding
you
mean
to
take
orders
,
he
has
great
pleasure
*NL*
in
offering
you
the
living
of
Delaford
now
just
vacant
,
and
only
wishes
*NL*
it
were
more
valuable
.
Allow
me
to
congratulate
you
on
having
so
*NL*
respectable
and
well-judging
a
friend
,
and
to
join
in
his
wish
that
the
*NL*
living
--
it
is
about
two
hundred
a-year
--
were
much
more
considerable
,
*NL*
and
such
as
might
better
enable
you
to
--
as
might
be
more
than
a
*NL*
temporary
accommodation
to
yourself
--
such
,
in
short
,
as
might
establish
*NL*
all
your
views
of
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
Edward
felt
,
as
he
could
not
say
it
himself
,
it
can
not
be
expected
*NL*
that
any
one
else
should
say
for
him
.
He
LOOKED
all
the
astonishment
*NL*
which
such
unexpected
,
such
unthought-of
information
could
not
fail
of
*NL*
exciting
;
but
he
said
only
these
two
words
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
Brandon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
continued
Elinor
,
gathering
more
resolution
,
as
some
of
the
*NL*
worst
was
over
,
``
Colonel
Brandon
means
it
as
a
testimony
of
his
concern
*NL*
for
what
has
lately
passed
--
for
the
cruel
situation
in
which
the
*NL*
unjustifiable
conduct
of
your
family
has
placed
you
--
a
concern
which
I
*NL*
am
sure
Marianne
,
myself
,
and
all
your
friends
,
must
share
;
and
*NL*
likewise
as
a
proof
of
his
high
esteem
for
your
general
character
,
and
*NL*
his
particular
approbation
of
your
behaviour
on
the
present
occasion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
Brandon
give
ME
a
living
!
--
Can
it
be
possible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
unkindness
of
your
own
relations
has
made
you
astonished
to
find
*NL*
friendship
any
where
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
he
,
with
sudden
consciousness
,
``
not
to
find
it
in
YOU
;
*NL*
for
I
can
not
be
ignorant
that
to
you
,
to
your
goodness
,
I
owe
it
*NL*
all
.
--
I
feel
it
--
I
would
express
it
if
I
could
--
but
,
as
you
well
know
,
*NL*
I
am
no
orator
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
much
mistaken
.
I
do
assure
you
that
you
owe
it
entirely

*NL*
at
least
almost
entirely
,
to
your
own
merit
,
and
Colonel
Brandon
's
*NL*
discernment
of
it
.
I
have
had
no
hand
in
it
.
I
did
not
even
know
,
*NL*
till
I
understood
his
design
,
that
the
living
was
vacant
;
nor
had
it
*NL*
ever
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
have
had
such
a
living
in
his
gift
.
*NL*
As
a
friend
of
mine
,
of
my
family
,
he
may
,
perhaps
--
indeed
I
know
he
*NL*
HAS
,
still
greater
pleasure
in
bestowing
it
;
but
,
upon
my
word
,
you
owe
*NL*
nothing
to
my
solicitation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Truth
obliged
her
to
acknowledge
some
small
share
in
the
action
,
but
*NL*
she
was
at
the
same
time
so
unwilling
to
appear
as
the
benefactress
of
*NL*
Edward
,
that
she
acknowledged
it
with
hesitation
;
which
probably
*NL*
contributed
to
fix
that
suspicion
in
his
mind
which
had
recently
*NL*
entered
it
.
For
a
short
time
he
sat
deep
in
thought
,
after
Elinor
had
*NL*
ceased
to
speak
;
--
at
last
,
and
as
if
it
were
rather
an
effort
,
he
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
Brandon
seems
a
man
of
great
worth
and
respectability
.
I
have
*NL*
always
heard
him
spoken
of
as
such
,
and
your
brother
I
know
esteems
him
*NL*
highly
.
He
is
undoubtedly
a
sensible
man
,
and
in
his
manners
perfectly
*NL*
the
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
I
believe
that
you
will
find
him
,
on
farther
*NL*
acquaintance
,
all
that
you
have
heard
him
to
be
,
and
as
you
will
be
*NL*
such
very
near
neighbours
-LRB-
for
I
understand
the
parsonage
is
almost
*NL*
close
to
the
mansion-house
,
-RRB-
it
is
particularly
important
that
he
*NL*
SHOULD
be
all
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
made
no
answer
;
but
when
she
had
turned
away
her
head
,
gave
her
*NL*
a
look
so
serious
,
so
earnest
,
so
uncheerful
,
as
seemed
to
say
,
that
he
*NL*
might
hereafter
wish
the
distance
between
the
parsonage
and
the
*NL*
mansion-house
much
greater
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
Brandon
,
I
think
,
lodges
in
St.
James
Street
,
''
said
he
,
soon
*NL*
afterwards
,
rising
from
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
told
him
the
number
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
hurry
away
then
,
to
give
him
those
thanks
which
you
will
not
*NL*
allow
me
to
give
YOU
;
to
assure
him
that
he
has
made
me
a
very
--
an
*NL*
exceedingly
happy
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
did
not
offer
to
detain
him
;
and
they
parted
,
with
a
very
*NL*
earnest
assurance
on
HER
side
of
her
unceasing
good
wishes
for
his
*NL*
happiness
in
every
change
of
situation
that
might
befall
him
;
on
HIS
,
*NL*
with
rather
an
attempt
to
return
the
same
good
will
,
than
the
power
of
*NL*
expressing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
see
him
again
,
''
said
Elinor
to
herself
,
as
the
door
shut
him
*NL*
out
,
``
I
shall
see
him
the
husband
of
Lucy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
this
pleasing
anticipation
,
she
sat
down
to
reconsider
the
*NL*
past
,
recall
the
words
and
endeavour
to
comprehend
all
the
feelings
of
*NL*
Edward
;
and
,
of
course
,
to
reflect
on
her
own
with
discontent
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Jennings
came
home
,
though
she
returned
from
seeing
people
*NL*
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
,
and
of
whom
therefore
she
must
have
a
*NL*
great
deal
to
say
,
her
mind
was
so
much
more
occupied
by
the
important
*NL*
secret
in
her
possession
,
than
by
anything
else
,
that
she
reverted
to
*NL*
it
again
as
soon
as
Elinor
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
''
she
cried
,
``
I
sent
you
up
the
young
man
.
Did
not
I
*NL*
do
right
?
--
And
I
suppose
you
had
no
great
difficulty
--
You
did
not
find
*NL*
him
very
unwilling
to
accept
your
proposal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
;
THAT
was
not
very
likely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
how
soon
will
he
be
ready
?
--
For
it
seems
all
to
depend
upon
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
I
know
so
little
of
these
kind
of
forms
,
that
I
*NL*
can
hardly
even
conjecture
as
to
the
time
,
or
the
preparation
*NL*
necessary
;
but
I
suppose
two
or
three
months
will
complete
his
*NL*
ordination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
or
three
months
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Jennings
;
``
Lord
!
my
dear
,
how
calmly
*NL*
you
talk
of
it
;
and
can
the
Colonel
wait
two
or
three
months
!
Lord
*NL*
bless
me
!
--
I
am
sure
it
would
put
ME
quite
out
of
patience
!
--
And
though
*NL*
one
would
be
very
glad
to
do
a
kindness
by
poor
Mr.
Ferrars
,
I
do
think
*NL*
it
is
not
worth
while
to
wait
two
or
three
months
for
him
.
Sure
*NL*
somebody
else
might
be
found
that
would
do
as
well
;
somebody
that
is
in
*NL*
orders
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
ma'am
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
?
--
Why
,
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
's
only
object
is
to
be
of
use
to
Mr.
Ferrars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
bless
you
,
my
dear
!
--
Sure
you
do
not
mean
to
persuade
me
that
the
*NL*
Colonel
only
marries
you
for
the
sake
of
giving
ten
guineas
to
Mr.
*NL*
Ferrars
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
deception
could
not
continue
after
this
;
and
an
explanation
*NL*
immediately
took
place
,
by
which
both
gained
considerable
amusement
for
*NL*
the
moment
,
without
any
material
loss
of
happiness
to
either
,
for
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
only
exchanged
one
form
of
delight
for
another
,
and
still
*NL*
without
forfeiting
her
expectation
of
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
the
parsonage
is
but
a
small
one
,
''
said
she
,
after
the
first
*NL*
ebullition
of
surprise
and
satisfaction
was
over
,
``
and
very
likely
MAY
*NL*
be
out
of
repair
;
but
to
hear
a
man
apologising
,
as
I
thought
,
for
a
*NL*
house
that
to
my
knowledge
has
five
sitting
rooms
on
the
ground-floor
,
*NL*
and
I
think
the
housekeeper
told
me
could
make
up
fifteen
beds
!
--
and
to
*NL*
you
too
,
that
had
been
used
to
live
in
Barton
cottage
!
--
It
seems
quite
*NL*
ridiculous
.
But
,
my
dear
,
we
must
touch
up
the
Colonel
to
do
some
*NL*
thing
to
the
parsonage
,
and
make
it
comfortable
for
them
,
before
Lucy
*NL*
goes
to
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Colonel
Brandon
does
not
seem
to
have
any
idea
of
the
living

*NL*
being
enough
to
allow
them
to
marry

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Colonel
is
a
ninny
,
my
dear
;
because
he
has
two
thousand
a-year
*NL*
himself
,
he
thinks
that
nobody
else
can
marry
on
less
.
Take
my
word
*NL*
for
it
,
that
,
if
I
am
alive
,
I
shall
be
paying
a
visit
at
Delaford
*NL*
Parsonage
before
Michaelmas
;
and
I
am
sure
I
sha
n't
go
if
Lucy
a
n't
*NL*
there
.

*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
was
quite
of
her
opinion

as
to
the
probability
of
their
not

waiting
for
any

more

CHAPTER
41
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
,
having
carried
his
thanks
to
Colonel
Brandon
,
proceeded
with
*NL*
his
happiness
to
Lucy
;
and
such
was
the
excess
of
it
by
the
time
he
*NL*
reached
Bartlett
's
Buildings
,
that
she
was
able
to
assure
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
,
who
called
on
her
again
the
next
day
with
her
*NL*
congratulations
,
that
she
had
never
seen
him
in
such
spirits
before
in
*NL*
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
own
happiness
,
and
her
own
spirits
,
were
at
least
very
certain
;
and
*NL*
she
joined
Mrs.
Jennings
most
heartily
in
her
expectation
of
their
*NL*
being
all
comfortably
together
in
Delaford
Parsonage
before
Michaelmas
.
*NL*
So
far
was
she
,
at
the
same
time
,
from
any
backwardness
to
give
Elinor
*NL*
that
credit
which
Edward
WOULD
give
her
,
that
she
spoke
of
her
*NL*
friendship
for
them
both
with
the
most
grateful
warmth
,
was
ready
to
*NL*
own
all
their
obligation
to
her
,
and
openly
declared
that
no
exertion
*NL*
for
their
good
on
Miss
Dashwood
's
part
,
either
present
or
future
,
would
*NL*
ever
surprise
her
,
for
she
believed
her
capable
of
doing
any
thing
in
*NL*
the
world
for
those
she
really
valued
.
As
for
Colonel
Brandon
,
she
was
*NL*
not
only
ready
to
worship
him
as
a
saint
,
but
was
moreover
truly
*NL*
anxious
that
he
should
be
treated
as
one
in
all
worldly
concerns
;
*NL*
anxious
that
his
tithes
should
be
raised
to
the
utmost
;
and
scarcely
*NL*
resolved
to
avail
herself
,
at
Delaford
,
as
far
as
she
possibly
could
,
*NL*
of
his
servants
,
his
carriage
,
his
cows
,
and
his
poultry
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
above
a
week
since
John
Dashwood
had
called
in
Berkeley
*NL*
Street
,
and
as
since
that
time
no
notice
had
been
taken
by
them
of
his
*NL*
wife
's
indisposition
,
beyond
one
verbal
enquiry
,
Elinor
began
to
feel
*NL*
it
necessary
to
pay
her
a
visit
.
--
This
was
an
obligation
,
however
,
*NL*
which
not
only
opposed
her
own
inclination
,
but
which
had
not
the
*NL*
assistance
of
any
encouragement
from
her
companions
.
Marianne
,
not
*NL*
contented
with
absolutely
refusing
to
go
herself
,
was
very
urgent
to
*NL*
prevent
her
sister
's
going
at
all
;
and
Mrs.
Jennings
,
though
her
*NL*
carriage
was
always
at
Elinor
's
service
,
so
very
much
disliked
Mrs.
*NL*
John
Dashwood
,
that
not
even
her
curiosity
to
see
how
she
looked
after
*NL*
the
late
discovery
,
nor
her
strong
desire
to
affront
her
by
taking
*NL*
Edward
's
part
,
could
overcome
her
unwillingness
to
be
in
her
company
*NL*
again
.
The
consequence
was
,
that
Elinor
set
out
by
herself
to
pay
a
*NL*
visit
,
for
which
no
one
could
really
have
less
inclination
,
and
to
run
*NL*
the
risk
of
a
tete-a-tete
with
a
woman
,
whom
neither
of
the
others
had
*NL*
so
much
reason
to
dislike
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
was
denied
;
but
before
the
carriage
could
turn
from
the
*NL*
house
,
her
husband
accidentally
came
out
.
He
expressed
great
pleasure
*NL*
in
meeting
Elinor
,
told
her
that
he
had
been
just
going
to
call
in
*NL*
Berkeley
Street
,
and
,
assuring
her
that
Fanny
would
be
very
glad
to
see
*NL*
her
,
invited
her
to
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
up
stairs
in
to
the
drawing-room
.
--
Nobody
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
is
in
her
own
room
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
he
:
--
``
I
will
go
to
her
*NL*
presently
,
for
I
am
sure
she
will
not
have
the
least
objection
in
the
*NL*
world
to
seeing
YOU
.
--
Very
far
from
it
,
indeed
.
NOW
especially
there
*NL*
can
not
be
--
but
however
,
you
and
Marianne
were
always
great
*NL*
favourites
.
--
Why
would
not
Marianne
come
?

--
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
made
what
excuse
she
could
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sorry
to
see
you
alone
,
''
he
replied
,
``
for
I
have
a
good
deal
*NL*
to
say
to
you

This
living
of
Colonel
Brandon
's

it
be
true
?

has
*NL*
he
really
given
it
to
Edward

I
heard
it
yesterday
by
chance
,
and
was
*NL*
coming
to
you
on
purpose
to
enquire
farther
about
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
perfectly
true

Colonel
Brandon
has
given
the
living
of

Delaford
to
Edward

*NL*
``
Really
!

Well
,
this
is
very
astonishing

no
relationship

no

connection

them

now
that
livings
fetch
such
a

price
!

was
the
value
of
this

*NL*
``
About
two
hundred
a
year

*NL*
``
Very
well

the
next
presentation

a
living
of
that
*NL*
value

supposing
the
late
incumbent
to
have
been
old
and
sickly
,
and
*NL*
likely
to
vacate
it
soon
--
he
might
have
got
I
dare
say
--
fourteen
*NL*
hundred
pounds
.
And
how
came
he
not
to
have
settled
that
matter
before
*NL*
this
person
's
death
?

NOW
indeed
it
would
be
too
late
to
sell
it
,
but
a
*NL*
man
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
sense
!

I
wonder
he
should
be
so
improvident

in
a
point
of
such
common
,
such
natural
,
concern
!
--
Well
,
I
am
convinced
*NL*
that
there
is
a
vast
deal
of
inconsistency
in
almost
every
human
*NL*
character
.
I
suppose
,
however
--
on
recollection
--
that
the
case
may
*NL*
probably
be
THIS

is
only
to
hold
the

the
person

whom
the
Colonel
has
really
sold

old
enough
to

take
it

Aye
,
aye
,
that
is
the
fact

depend
upon
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
contradicted
it
,
however
,
very
positively
;
and
by
relating
that
*NL*
she
had
herself
been
employed
in
conveying
the
offer
from
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
to
Edward
,
and
,
therefore
,
must
understand
the
terms
on
which
*NL*
it
was
given
,
obliged
him
to
submit
to
her
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
truly
astonishing
!
''
--
he
cried
,
after
hearing
what
she
*NL*
said

``
what
could
be
the
Colonel

motive

*NL*
*NL*

A

well

not

*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
had
some
difficulty
here
to
refrain
from
observing
,
that
she
*NL*
thought
Fanny
might
have
borne
with
composure
,
an
acquisition
of
wealth
*NL*
to
her
brother
,
by
which
neither
she
nor
her
child
could
be
possibly
*NL*
impoverished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
''
added
he
,
lowering
his
voice
to
the
tone
becoming
so
*NL*
important
a
subject
,
``
knows
nothing
about
it
at
present
,
and
I
believe
*NL*
it
will
be
best
to
keep
it
entirely
concealed
from
her
as
long
as
may
*NL*
be

When
the
marriage
takes
place
,
I
fear
she
must
hear
of
it
all
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
such
precaution
be
used
?

Though
it
is
not
to
be
*NL*
supposed
that
Mrs.
Ferrars
can
have
the
smallest
satisfaction
in
*NL*
knowing
that
her
son
has
money
enough
to
live
upon

for
THAT
must
be
*NL*
quite
out
of
the
question

yet
why

upon
her
late
behaviour

is
she
*NL*
supposed
to
feel
at
all
?

She
has
done
with
her
son

she
cast
him
off

for
ever
,

has
made
all
those
over

she
had
any
influence

cast
*NL*
him
off
likewise

Surely
,

doing
so

she
can

liable

any
impression

sorrow

of
joy
on

she
can
not

be
interested

any
thing
that
befalls
him

She
would
not
be
so
weak
*NL*
as
to
throw
away
the
comfort
of
a
child
,

yet
retain
the
anxiety
of

a
parent

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Elinor

said
John
,
``
your
reasoning

very
good

it

depend
upon

*NL*
Elinor
was
silent
.
*NL*

``

said
Mr.

after
a
short
pause

``
of

Elinor

smiling
at

calmly
replied

*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
said
no
more
,
and
John
was
also
for
a
short
time
silent
.
--
His
*NL*
reflections
ended
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
ONE
thing
,
my
dear
sister
,
''
kindly
taking
her
hand
,
and
speaking
in
*NL*
an
awful
whisper
,
--
``
I
may
assure
you
;
--
and
I
WILL
do
it
,
because
I
know
*NL*
it
must
gratify
you
.
I
have
good
reason
to
think
--
indeed
I
have
it
*NL*
from
the
best
authority
,
or
I
should
not
repeat
it
,
for
otherwise
it
*NL*
would
be
very
wrong
to
say
any
thing
about
it
--
but
I
have
it
from
the
*NL*
very
best
authority
--
not
that
I
ever
precisely
heard
Mrs.
Ferrars
say
*NL*
it
herself
--
but
her
daughter
DID
,
and
I
have
it
from
her
--
That
in
*NL*
short
,
whatever
objections
there
might
be
against
a
certain
--
a
certain
*NL*
connection
--
you
understand
me
--
it
would
have
been
far
preferable
to
*NL*
her
,
it
would
not
have
given
her
half
the
vexation
that
THIS
does
.
I
*NL*
was
exceedingly
pleased
to
hear
that
Mrs.
Ferrars
considered
it
in
that
*NL*
light
--
a
very
gratifying
circumstance
you
know
to
us
all
.
`
It
would
*NL*
have
been
beyond
comparison

she
said
,
`
the
least
evil
of
the
two

*NL*
she
would
be
glad
to
compound
NOW
for
nothing
worse

But
however
,
all
*NL*
that
is
quite
out
of
the
question
--
not
to
be
thought
of
or
*NL*
mentioned
--
as
to
any
attachment
you
know
--
it
never
could
be
--
all
that
*NL*
is
gone
by
.
But
I
thought
I
would
just
tell
you
of
this
,
because
I
*NL*
knew
how
much
it
must
please
you
.
Not
that
you
have
any
reason
to
*NL*
regret
,
my
dear
Elinor
.
There
is
no
doubt
of
your
doing
exceedingly
*NL*
well
--
quite
as
well
,
or
better
,
perhaps
,
all
things
considered
.
Has
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
been
with
you
lately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
had
heard
enough
,
if
not
to
gratify
her
vanity
,
and
raise
her
*NL*
self-importance
,
to
agitate
her
nerves
and
fill
her
mind
;
--
and
she
was
*NL*
therefore
glad
to
be
spared
from
the
necessity
of
saying
much
in
reply
*NL*
herself
,
and
from
the
danger
of
hearing
any
thing
more
from
her
*NL*
brother
,
by
the
entrance
of
Mr.
Robert
Ferrars
.
After
a
few
moments
'
*NL*
chat
,
John
Dashwood
,
recollecting
that
Fanny
was
yet
uninformed
of
her
*NL*
sister
's
being
there
,
quitted
the
room
in
quest
of
her
;
and
Elinor
was
*NL*
left
to
improve
her
acquaintance
with
Robert
,
who
,
by
the
gay
*NL*
unconcern
,
the
happy
self-complacency
of
his
manner
while
enjoying
so
*NL*
unfair
a
division
of
his
mother
's
love
and
liberality
,
to
the
prejudice
*NL*
of
his
banished
brother
,
earned
only
by
his
own
dissipated
course
of
*NL*
life
,
and
that
brother
's
integrity
,
was
confirming
her
most
*NL*
unfavourable
opinion
of
his
head
and
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
scarcely
been
two
minutes
by
themselves
,
before
he
began
to
*NL*
speak
of
Edward
;
for
he
,
too
,
had
heard
of
the
living
,
and
was
very
*NL*
inquisitive
on
the
subject
.
Elinor
repeated
the
particulars
of
it
,
as
*NL*
she
had
given
them
to
John
;
and
their
effect
on
Robert
,
though
very
*NL*
different
,
was
not
less
striking
than
it
had
been
on
HIM
.
He
laughed
*NL*
most
immoderately
.
The
idea
of
Edward
's
being
a
clergyman
,
and
living
*NL*
in
a
small
parsonage-house
,
diverted
him
beyond
measure
;
--
and
when
to
*NL*
that
was
added
the
fanciful
imagery
of
Edward
reading
prayers
in
a
*NL*
white
surplice
,
and
publishing
the
banns
of
marriage
between
John
Smith
*NL*
and
Mary
Brown
,
he
could
conceive
nothing
more
ridiculous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
while
she
waited
in
silence
and
immovable
gravity
,
the
*NL*
conclusion
of
such
folly
,
could
not
restrain
her
eyes
from
being
fixed
*NL*
on
him
with
a
look
that
spoke
all
the
contempt
it
excited
.
It
was
a
*NL*
look
,
however
,
very
well
bestowed
,
for
it
relieved
her
own
feelings
,
*NL*
and
gave
no
intelligence
to
him
.
He
was
recalled
from
wit
to
wisdom
,
*NL*
not
by
any
reproof
of
hers
,
but
by
his
own
sensibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
may
treat
it
as
a
joke
,
''
said
he
,
at
last
,
recovering
from
the
*NL*
affected
laugh
which
had
considerably
lengthened
out
the
genuine
gaiety
*NL*
of
the
moment
--
``
but
,
upon
my
soul
,
it
is
a
most
serious
business
.
Poor
*NL*
Edward
!
he
is
ruined
for
ever
.
I
am
extremely
sorry
for
it
--
for
I
*NL*
know
him
to
be
a
very
good-hearted
creature
;
as
well-meaning
a
fellow
*NL*
perhaps
,
as
any
in
the
world

You
must
not
judge
of
him

Miss
*NL*
Dashwood
,
from
YOUR
slight
acquaintance

--
Poor
Edward
!
--
His
manners
are
*NL*
certainly
not
the
happiest

But
we
are
not
all
born

*NL*
know

with
the

the

fellow

to
see
*NL*
him
in

of
strangers

to
be
sure
it

pitiable
enough

my
soul

believe

has
as
good
a
heart

any
in
the
kingdom

I
declare

protest
to
you

never
was
so
shocked

my
life

it
all
burst
forth
.
I
could
not
believe
it
.
--
My
mother
was
the
*NL*
first
person
who
told
me
of
it
;
and
I
,
feeling
myself
called
on
to
act
*NL*
with
resolution
,
immediately
said
to
her
,
`
My
dear
madam
,
I
do
not
know
*NL*
what
you
may
intend
to
do
on
the
occasion
,
but
as
for
myself
,
I
must
*NL*
say
,
that
if
Edward
does
marry
this
young
woman
,
I
never
will
see
him
*NL*
again
.
'
That
was
what
I
said
immediately
.
--
I
was
most
uncommonly
*NL*
shocked
,
indeed
!
--
Poor
Edward
!
--
he
has
done
for
himself
*NL*
completely
--
shut
himself
out
for
ever
from
all
decent
society
!
--
but
,
as
*NL*
I
directly
said
to
my
mother
,
I
am
not
in
the
least
surprised
at
it
;
*NL*
from
his
style
of
education
,
it
was
always
to
be
expected
.
My
poor
*NL*
mother
was
half
frantic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
seen
the
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
once
,
while
she
was
staying
in
this
house
,
I
happened
to
drop
in
*NL*
for
ten
minutes
;
and
I
saw
quite
enough
of
her
.
The
merest
awkward
*NL*
country
girl
,
without
style
,
or
elegance
,
and
almost
without
beauty
.
--
*NL*
I
remember
her
perfectly
.
Just
the
kind
of
girl
I
should
suppose
*NL*
likely
to
captivate
poor
Edward
.
I
offered
immediately
,
as
soon
as
my
*NL*
mother
related
the
affair
to
me
,
to
talk
to
him
myself
,
and
dissuade
*NL*
him
from
the
match
;
but
it
was
too
late
THEN
,
I
found
,
to
do
any
thing
,
*NL*
for
unluckily
,
I
was
not
in
the
way
at
first
,
and
knew
nothing
of
it
*NL*
till
after
the
breach
had
taken
place
,
when
it
was
not
for
me
,
you
*NL*
know
,
to
interfere
.
But
had
I
been
informed
of
it
a
few
hours
*NL*
earlier
--
I
think
it
is
most
probable
--
that
something
might
have
been
*NL*
hit
on
.
I
certainly
should
have
represented
it
to
Edward
in
a
very
*NL*
strong
light
.
`
My
dear
fellow
,
'
I
should
have
said
,
`
consider
what
you
*NL*
are
doing
.
You
are
making
a
most
disgraceful
connection
,
and
such
a
*NL*
one
as
your
family
are
unanimous
in
disapproving
.
'
I
can
not
help
*NL*
thinking
,
in
short
,
that
means
might
have
been
found
.
But
now
it
is
*NL*
all
too
late
.
He
must
be
starved
,
you
know
;
--
that
is
certain
;
*NL*
absolutely
starved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
just
settled
this
point
with
great
composure
,
when
the
entrance
*NL*
of
Mrs.
John
Dashwood
put
an
end
to
the
subject
.
But
though
SHE
never
*NL*
spoke
of
it
out
of
her
own
family
,
Elinor
could
see
its
influence
on
*NL*
her
mind
,
in
the
something
like
confusion
of
countenance
with
which
she
*NL*
entered
,
and
an
attempt
at
cordiality
in
her
behaviour
to
herself
.
She
*NL*
even
proceeded
so
far
as
to
be
concerned
to
find
that
Elinor
and
her
*NL*
sister
were
so
soon
to
leave
town
,
as
she
had
hoped
to
see
more
of
*NL*
them
;
--
an
exertion
in
which
her
husband
,
who
attended
her
into
the
*NL*
room
,
and
hung
enamoured
over
her
accents
,
seemed
to
distinguish
every
*NL*
thing
that
was
most
affectionate
and
graceful
.

CHAPTER
42
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
other
short
call
in
Harley
Street
,
in
which
Elinor
received
her
*NL*
brother
's
congratulations
on
their
travelling
so
far
towards
Barton
*NL*
without
any
expense
,
and
on
Colonel
Brandon
's
being
to
follow
them
to
*NL*
Cleveland
in
a
day
or
two
,
completed
the
intercourse
of
the
brother
and
*NL*
sisters
in
town
;
--
and
a
faint
invitation
from
Fanny
,
to
come
to
Norland
*NL*
whenever
it
should
happen
to
be
in
their
way
,
which
of
all
things
was
*NL*
the
most
unlikely
to
occur
,
with
a
more
warm
,
though
less
public
,
*NL*
assurance
,
from
John
to
Elinor
,
of
the
promptitude
with
which
he
should
*NL*
come
to
see
her
at
Delaford
,
was
all
that
foretold
any
meeting
in
the
*NL*
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
amused
her
to
observe
that
all
her
friends
seemed
determined
to
send
*NL*
her
to
Delaford
;
--
a
place
,
in
which
,
of
all
others
,
she
would
now
least
*NL*
chuse
to
visit
,
or
wish
to
reside
;
for
not
only
was
it
considered
as
*NL*
her
future
home
by
her
brother
and
Mrs.
Jennings
,
but
even
Lucy
,
when
*NL*
they
parted
,
gave
her
a
pressing
invitation
to
visit
her
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
early
in
April
,
and
tolerably
early
in
the
day
,
the
two
parties
*NL*
from
Hanover
Square
and
Berkeley
Street
set
out
from
their
respective
*NL*
homes
,
to
meet
,
by
appointment
,
on
the
road
.
For
the
convenience
of
*NL*
Charlotte
and
her
child
,
they
were
to
be
more
than
two
days
on
their
*NL*
journey
,
and
Mr.
Palmer
,
travelling
more
expeditiously
with
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
,
was
to
join
them
at
Cleveland
soon
after
their
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
,
few
as
had
been
her
hours
of
comfort
in
London
,
and
eager
as
*NL*
she
had
long
been
to
quit
it
,
could
not
,
when
it
came
to
the
point
,
bid
*NL*
adieu
to
the
house
in
which
she
had
for
the
last
time
enjoyed
those
*NL*
hopes
,
and
that
confidence
,
in
Willoughby
,
which
were
now
extinguished
*NL*
for
ever
,
without
great
pain
.
Nor
could
she
leave
the
place
in
which
*NL*
Willoughby
remained
,
busy
in
new
engagements
,
and
new
schemes
,
in
which
*NL*
SHE
could
have
no
share
,
without
shedding
many
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
satisfaction
,
at
the
moment
of
removal
,
was
more
positive
.
*NL*
She
had
no
such
object
for
her
lingering
thoughts
to
fix
on
,
she
left
*NL*
no
creature
behind
,
from
whom
it
would
give
her
a
moment
's
regret
to
be
*NL*
divided
for
ever
,
she
was
pleased
to
be
free
herself
from
the
*NL*
persecution
of
Lucy
's
friendship
,
she
was
grateful
for
bringing
her
*NL*
sister
away
unseen
by
Willoughby
since
his
marriage
,
and
she
looked
*NL*
forward
with
hope
to
what
a
few
months
of
tranquility
at
Barton
might
*NL*
do
towards
restoring
Marianne
's
peace
of
mind
,
and
confirming
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
journey
was
safely
performed
.
The
second
day
brought
them
into
*NL*
the
cherished
,
or
the
prohibited
,
county
of
Somerset
,
for
as
such
was
*NL*
it
dwelt
on
by
turns
in
Marianne
's
imagination
;
and
in
the
forenoon
of
*NL*
the
third
they
drove
up
to
Cleveland
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cleveland
was
a
spacious
,
modern-built
house
,
situated
on
a
sloping
*NL*
lawn
.
It
had
no
park
,
but
the
pleasure-grounds
were
tolerably
*NL*
extensive
;
and
like
every
other
place
of
the
same
degree
of
importance
,
*NL*
it
had
its
open
shrubbery
,
and
closer
wood
walk
,
a
road
of
smooth
*NL*
gravel
winding
round
a
plantation
,
led
to
the
front
,
the
lawn
was
*NL*
dotted
over
with
timber
,
the
house
itself
was
under
the
guardianship
of
*NL*
the
fir
,
the
mountain-ash
,
and
the
acacia
,
and
a
thick
screen
of
them
*NL*
altogether
,
interspersed
with
tall
Lombardy
poplars
,
shut
out
the
*NL*
offices
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
entered
the
house
with
a
heart
swelling
with
emotion
from
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
being
only
eighty
miles
from
Barton
,
and
not
thirty
*NL*
from
Combe
Magna
;
and
before
she
had
been
five
minutes
within
its
*NL*
walls
,
while
the
others
were
busily
helping
Charlotte
to
show
her
child
*NL*
to
the
housekeeper
,
she
quitted
it
again
,
stealing
away
through
the
*NL*
winding
shrubberies
,
now
just
beginning
to
be
in
beauty
,
to
gain
a
*NL*
distant
eminence
;
where
,
from
its
Grecian
temple
,
her
eye
,
wandering
*NL*
over
a
wide
tract
of
country
to
the
south-east
,
could
fondly
rest
on
*NL*
the
farthest
ridge
of
hills
in
the
horizon
,
and
fancy
that
from
their
*NL*
summits
Combe
Magna
might
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
moments
of
precious
,
invaluable
misery
,
she
rejoiced
in
tears
*NL*
of
agony
to
be
at
Cleveland
;
and
as
she
returned
by
a
different
circuit
*NL*
to
the
house
,
feeling
all
the
happy
privilege
of
country
liberty
,
of
*NL*
wandering
from
place
to
place
in
free
and
luxurious
solitude
,
she
*NL*
resolved
to
spend
almost
every
hour
of
every
day
while
she
remained
*NL*
with
the
Palmers
,
in
the
indulgence
of
such
solitary
rambles
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
just
in
time
to
join
the
others
as
they
quitted
the
house
,
*NL*
on
an
excursion
through
its
more
immediate
premises
;
and
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
morning
was
easily
whiled
away
,
in
lounging
round
the
kitchen
*NL*
garden
,
examining
the
bloom
upon
its
walls
,
and
listening
to
the
*NL*
gardener
's
lamentations
upon
blights
,
in
dawdling
through
the
*NL*
green-house
,
where
the
loss
of
her
favourite
plants
,
unwarily
exposed
,
*NL*
and
nipped
by
the
lingering
frost
,
raised
the
laughter
of
*NL*
Charlotte
,
--
and
in
visiting
her
poultry-yard
,
where
,
in
the
*NL*
disappointed
hopes
of
her
dairy-maid
,
by
hens
forsaking
their
nests
,
or
*NL*
being
stolen
by
a
fox
,
or
in
the
rapid
decrease
of
a
promising
young
*NL*
brood
,
she
found
fresh
sources
of
merriment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
was
fine
and
dry
,
and
Marianne
,
in
her
plan
of
employment
*NL*
abroad
,
had
not
calculated
for
any
change
of
weather
during
their
stay
*NL*
at
Cleveland
.
With
great
surprise
therefore
,
did
she
find
herself
*NL*
prevented
by
a
settled
rain
from
going
out
again
after
dinner
.
She
had
*NL*
depended
on
a
twilight
walk
to
the
Grecian
temple
,
and
perhaps
all
over
*NL*
the
grounds
,
and
an
evening
merely
cold
or
damp
would
not
have
deterred
*NL*
her
from
it
;
but
a
heavy
and
settled
rain
even
SHE
could
not
fancy
dry
*NL*
or
pleasant
weather
for
walking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
party
was
small
,
and
the
hours
passed
quietly
away
.
Mrs.
Palmer
*NL*
had
her
child
,
and
Mrs.
Jennings
her
carpet-work
;
they
talked
of
the
*NL*
friends
they
had
left
behind
,
arranged
Lady
Middleton
's
engagements
,
*NL*
and
wondered
whether
Mr.
Palmer
and
Colonel
Brandon
would
get
farther
*NL*
than
Reading
that
night
.
Elinor
,
however
little
concerned
in
it
,
*NL*
joined
in
their
discourse
;
and
Marianne
,
who
had
the
knack
of
finding
*NL*
her
way
in
every
house
to
the
library
,
however
it
might
be
avoided
by
*NL*
the
family
in
general
,
soon
procured
herself
a
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
was
wanting
on
Mrs.
Palmer
's
side
that
constant
and
friendly
*NL*
good
humour
could
do
,
to
make
them
feel
themselves
welcome
.
The
*NL*
openness
and
heartiness
of
her
manner
more
than
atoned
for
that
want
of
*NL*
recollection
and
elegance
which
made
her
often
deficient
in
the
forms
*NL*
of
politeness
;
her
kindness
,
recommended
by
so
pretty
a
face
,
was
*NL*
engaging
;
her
folly
,
though
evident
was
not
disgusting
,
because
it
was
*NL*
not
conceited
;
and
Elinor
could
have
forgiven
every
thing
but
her
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
gentlemen
arrived
the
next
day
to
a
very
late
dinner
,
affording
*NL*
a
pleasant
enlargement
of
the
party
,
and
a
very
welcome
variety
to
*NL*
their
conversation
,
which
a
long
morning
of
the
same
continued
rain
had
*NL*
reduced
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
had
seen
so
little
of
Mr.
Palmer
,
and
in
that
little
had
seen
so
*NL*
much
variety
in
his
address
to
her
sister
and
herself
,
that
she
knew
*NL*
not
what
to
expect
to
find
him
in
his
own
family
.
She
found
him
,
*NL*
however
,
perfectly
the
gentleman
in
his
behaviour
to
all
his
visitors
,
*NL*
and
only
occasionally
rude
to
his
wife
and
her
mother
;
she
found
him
*NL*
very
capable
of
being
a
pleasant
companion
,
and
only
prevented
from
*NL*
being
so
always
,
by
too
great
an
aptitude
to
fancy
himself
as
much
*NL*
superior
to
people
in
general
,
as
he
must
feel
himself
to
be
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
and
Charlotte
.
For
the
rest
of
his
character
and
habits
,
they
*NL*
were
marked
,
as
far
as
Elinor
could
perceive
,
with
no
traits
at
all
*NL*
unusual
in
his
sex
and
time
of
life
.
He
was
nice
in
his
eating
,
*NL*
uncertain
in
his
hours
;
fond
of
his
child
,
though
affecting
to
slight
*NL*
it
;
and
idled
away
the
mornings
at
billiards
,
which
ought
to
have
been
*NL*
devoted
to
business
.
She
liked
him
,
however
,
upon
the
whole
,
much
*NL*
better
than
she
had
expected
,
and
in
her
heart
was
not
sorry
that
she
*NL*
could
like
him
no
more
;
--
not
sorry
to
be
driven
by
the
observation
of
*NL*
his
Epicurism
,
his
selfishness
,
and
his
conceit
,
to
rest
with
*NL*
complacency
on
the
remembrance
of
Edward
's
generous
temper
,
simple
*NL*
taste
,
and
diffident
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
Edward
,
or
at
least
of
some
of
his
concerns
,
she
now
received
*NL*
intelligence
from
Colonel
Brandon
,
who
had
been
into
Dorsetshire
*NL*
lately
;
and
who
,
treating
her
at
once
as
the
disinterested
friend
of
*NL*
Mr.
Ferrars
,
and
the
kind
confidante
of
himself
,
talked
to
her
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
the
parsonage
at
Delaford
,
described
its
deficiencies
,
*NL*
and
told
her
what
he
meant
to
do
himself
towards
removing
them
.
--
His
*NL*
behaviour
to
her
in
this
,
as
well
as
in
every
other
particular
,
his
*NL*
open
pleasure
in
meeting
her
after
an
absence
of
only
ten
days
,
his
*NL*
readiness
to
converse
with
her
,
and
his
deference
for
her
opinion
,
*NL*
might
very
well
justify
Mrs.
Jennings
's
persuasion
of
his
attachment
,
*NL*
and
would
have
been
enough
,
perhaps
,
had
not
Elinor
still
,
as
from
the
*NL*
first
,
believed
Marianne
his
real
favourite
,
to
make
her
suspect
it
*NL*
herself
.
But
as
it
was
,
such
a
notion
had
scarcely
ever
entered
her
*NL*
head
,
except
by
Mrs.
Jennings
's
suggestion
;
and
she
could
not
help
*NL*
believing
herself
the
nicest
observer
of
the
two
;
--
she
watched
his
*NL*
eyes
,
while
Mrs.
Jennings
thought
only
of
his
behaviour
;
--
and
while
his
*NL*
looks
of
anxious
solicitude
on
Marianne
's
feeling
,
in
her
head
and
*NL*
throat
,
the
beginning
of
a
heavy
cold
,
because
unexpressed
by
words
,
*NL*
entirely
escaped
the
latter
lady
's
observation
;
--
SHE
could
discover
in
*NL*
them
the
quick
feelings
,
and
needless
alarm
of
a
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
delightful
twilight
walks
on
the
third
and
fourth
evenings
of
her
*NL*
being
there
,
not
merely
on
the
dry
gravel
of
the
shrubbery
,
but
all
*NL*
over
the
grounds
,
and
especially
in
the
most
distant
parts
of
them
,
*NL*
where
there
was
something
more
of
wildness
than
in
the
rest
,
where
the
*NL*
trees
were
the
oldest
,
and
the
grass
was
the
longest
and
wettest
,
*NL*
had
--
assisted
by
the
still
greater
imprudence
of
sitting
in
her
wet
*NL*
shoes
and
stockings
--
given
Marianne
a
cold
so
violent
as
,
though
for
a
*NL*
day
or
two
trifled
with
or
denied
,
would
force
itself
by
increasing
*NL*
ailments
on
the
concern
of
every
body
,
and
the
notice
of
herself
.
*NL*
Prescriptions
poured
in
from
all
quarters
,
and
as
usual
,
were
all
*NL*
declined
.
Though
heavy
and
feverish
,
with
a
pain
in
her
limbs
,
and
a
*NL*
cough
,
and
a
sore
throat
,
a
good
night
's
rest
was
to
cure
her
entirely
;
*NL*
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
Elinor
prevailed
on
her
,
when
she
went
*NL*
to
bed
,
to
try
one
or
two
of
the
simplest
of
the
remedies
.

CHAPTER
43
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
got
up
the
next
morning
at
her
usual
time
;
to
every
inquiry
*NL*
replied
that
she
was
better
,
and
tried
to
prove
herself
so
,
by
engaging
*NL*
in
her
accustomary
employments
.
But
a
day
spent
in
sitting
shivering
*NL*
over
the
fire
with
a
book
in
her
hand
,
which
she
was
unable
to
read
,
or
*NL*
in
lying
,
weary
and
languid
,
on
a
sofa
,
did
not
speak
much
in
favour
of
*NL*
her
amendment
;
and
when
,
at
last
,
she
went
early
to
bed
,
more
and
more
*NL*
indisposed
,
Colonel
Brandon
was
only
astonished
at
her
sister
's
*NL*
composure
,
who
,
though
attending
and
nursing
her
the
whole
day
,
against
*NL*
Marianne
's
inclination
,
and
forcing
proper
medicines
on
her
at
night
,
*NL*
trusted
,
like
Marianne
,
to
the
certainty
and
efficacy
of
sleep
,
and
*NL*
felt
no
real
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
restless
and
feverish
night
,
however
,
disappointed
the
*NL*
expectation
of
both
;
and
when
Marianne
,
after
persisting
in
rising
,
*NL*
confessed
herself
unable
to
sit
up
,
and
returned
voluntarily
to
her
*NL*
bed
,
Elinor
was
very
ready
to
adopt
Mrs.
Jennings
's
advice
,
of
sending
*NL*
for
the
Palmers
'
apothecary
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
,
examined
his
patient
,
and
though
encouraging
Miss
Dashwood
to
*NL*
expect
that
a
very
few
days
would
restore
her
sister
to
health
,
yet
,
by
*NL*
pronouncing
her
disorder
to
have
a
putrid
tendency
,
and
allowing
the
*NL*
word
``
infection
''
to
pass
his
lips
,
gave
instant
alarm
to
Mrs.
Palmer
,
*NL*
on
her
baby
's
account
.
Mrs.
Jennings
,
who
had
been
inclined
from
the
*NL*
first
to
think
Marianne
's
complaint
more
serious
than
Elinor
,
now
*NL*
looked
very
grave
on
Mr.
Harris
's
report
,
and
confirming
Charlotte
's
*NL*
fears
and
caution
,
urged
the
necessity
of
her
immediate
removal
with
*NL*
her
infant
;
and
Mr.
Palmer
,
though
treating
their
apprehensions
as
*NL*
idle
,
found
the
anxiety
and
importunity
of
his
wife
too
great
to
be
*NL*
withstood
.
Her
departure
,
therefore
,
was
fixed
on
;
and
within
an
hour
*NL*
after
Mr.
Harris
's
arrival
,
she
set
off
,
with
her
little
boy
and
his
*NL*
nurse
,
for
the
house
of
a
near
relation
of
Mr.
Palmer
's
,
who
lived
a
*NL*
few
miles
on
the
other
side
of
Bath
;
whither
her
husband
promised
,
at
*NL*
her
earnest
entreaty
,
to
join
her
in
a
day
or
two
;
and
whither
she
was
*NL*
almost
equally
urgent
with
her
mother
to
accompany
her
.
Mrs.
Jennings
,
*NL*
however
,
with
a
kindness
of
heart
which
made
Elinor
really
love
her
,
*NL*
declared
her
resolution
of
not
stirring
from
Cleveland
as
long
as
*NL*
Marianne
remained
ill
,
and
of
endeavouring
,
by
her
own
attentive
care
,
*NL*
to
supply
to
her
the
place
of
the
mother
she
had
taken
her
from
;
and
*NL*
Elinor
found
her
on
every
occasion
a
most
willing
and
active
helpmate
,
*NL*
desirous
to
share
in
all
her
fatigues
,
and
often
by
her
better
*NL*
experience
in
nursing
,
of
material
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Marianne
,
languid
and
low
from
the
nature
of
her
malady
,
and
*NL*
feeling
herself
universally
ill
,
could
no
longer
hope
that
tomorrow
*NL*
would
find
her
recovered
;
and
the
idea
of
what
tomorrow
would
have
*NL*
produced
,
but
for
this
unlucky
illness
,
made
every
ailment
severe
;
for
*NL*
on
that
day
they
were
to
have
begun
their
journey
home
;
and
,
attended
*NL*
the
whole
way
by
a
servant
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
were
to
have
taken
their
*NL*
mother
by
surprise
on
the
following
forenoon
.
The
little
she
said
was
*NL*
all
in
lamentation
of
this
inevitable
delay
;
though
Elinor
tried
to
*NL*
raise
her
spirits
,
and
make
her
believe
,
as
she
THEN
really
believed
*NL*
herself
,
that
it
would
be
a
very
short
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
produced
little
or
no
alteration
in
the
state
of
the
*NL*
patient
;
she
certainly
was
not
better
,
and
,
except
that
there
was
no
*NL*
amendment
,
did
not
appear
worse
.
Their
party
was
now
farther
reduced
;
*NL*
for
Mr.
Palmer
,
though
very
unwilling
to
go
as
well
from
real
humanity
*NL*
and
good-nature
,
as
from
a
dislike
of
appearing
to
be
frightened
away
*NL*
by
his
wife
,
was
persuaded
at
last
by
Colonel
Brandon
to
perform
his
*NL*
promise
of
following
her
;
and
while
he
was
preparing
to
go
,
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
himself
,
with
a
much
greater
exertion
,
began
to
talk
of
going
*NL*
likewise
.
--
Here
,
however
,
the
kindness
of
Mrs.
Jennings
interposed
most
*NL*
acceptably
;
for
to
send
the
Colonel
away
while
his
love
was
in
so
much
*NL*
uneasiness
on
her
sister
's
account
,
would
be
to
deprive
them
both
,
she
*NL*
thought
,
of
every
comfort
;
and
therefore
telling
him
at
once
that
his
*NL*
stay
at
Cleveland
was
necessary
to
herself
,
that
she
should
want
him
to
*NL*
play
at
piquet
of
an
evening
,
while
Miss
Dashwood
was
above
with
her
*NL*
sister
,
&
c.
she
urged
him
so
strongly
to
remain
,
that
he
,
who
was
*NL*
gratifying
the
first
wish
of
his
own
heart
by
a
compliance
,
could
not
*NL*
long
even
affect
to
demur
;
especially
as
Mrs.
Jennings
's
entreaty
was
*NL*
warmly
seconded
by
Mr.
Palmer
,
who
seemed
to
feel
a
relief
to
himself
,
*NL*
in
leaving
behind
him
a
person
so
well
able
to
assist
or
advise
Miss
*NL*
Dashwood
in
any
emergence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
was
,
of
course
,
kept
in
ignorance
of
all
these
arrangements
.
*NL*
She
knew
not
that
she
had
been
the
means
of
sending
the
owners
of
*NL*
Cleveland
away
,
in
about
seven
days
from
the
time
of
their
arrival
.
It
*NL*
gave
her
no
surprise
that
she
saw
nothing
of
Mrs.
Palmer
;
and
as
it
*NL*
gave
her
likewise
no
concern
,
she
never
mentioned
her
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
passed
away
from
the
time
of
Mr.
Palmer
's
departure
,
and
her
*NL*
situation
continued
,
with
little
variation
,
the
same
.
Mr.
Harris
,
who
*NL*
attended
her
every
day
,
still
talked
boldly
of
a
speedy
recovery
,
and
*NL*
Miss
Dashwood
was
equally
sanguine
;
but
the
expectation
of
the
others
*NL*
was
by
no
means
so
cheerful
.
Mrs.
Jennings
had
determined
very
early
*NL*
in
the
seizure
that
Marianne
would
never
get
over
it
,
and
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
,
who
was
chiefly
of
use
in
listening
to
Mrs.
Jennings
's
*NL*
forebodings
,
was
not
in
a
state
of
mind
to
resist
their
influence
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
reason
himself
out
of
fears
,
which
the
different
judgment
of
*NL*
the
apothecary
seemed
to
render
absurd
;
but
the
many
hours
of
each
day
*NL*
in
which
he
was
left
entirely
alone
,
were
but
too
favourable
for
the
*NL*
admission
of
every
melancholy
idea
,
and
he
could
not
expel
from
his
*NL*
mind
the
persuasion
that
he
should
see
Marianne
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
of
the
third
day
however
,
the
gloomy
anticipations
of
*NL*
both
were
almost
done
away
;
for
when
Mr.
Harris
arrived
,
he
declared
*NL*
his
patient
materially
better
.
Her
pulse
was
much
stronger
,
and
every
*NL*
symptom
more
favourable
than
on
the
preceding
visit
.
Elinor
,
confirmed
*NL*
in
every
pleasant
hope
,
was
all
cheerfulness
;
rejoicing
that
in
her
*NL*
letters
to
her
mother
,
she
had
pursued
her
own
judgment
rather
than
her
*NL*
friend
's
,
in
making
very
light
of
the
indisposition
which
delayed
them
*NL*
at
Cleveland
;
and
almost
fixing
on
the
time
when
Marianne
would
be
able
*NL*
to
travel
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
day
did
not
close
so
auspiciously
as
it
began
.
--
Towards
the
*NL*
evening
Marianne
became
ill
again
,
growing
more
heavy
,
restless
,
and
*NL*
uncomfortable
than
before
.
Her
sister
,
however
,
still
sanguine
,
was
*NL*
willing
to
attribute
the
change
to
nothing
more
than
the
fatigue
of
*NL*
having
sat
up
to
have
her
bed
made
;
and
carefully
administering
the
*NL*
cordials
prescribed
,
saw
her
,
with
satisfaction
,
sink
at
last
into
a
*NL*
slumber
,
from
which
she
expected
the
most
beneficial
effects
.
Her
*NL*
sleep
,
though
not
so
quiet
as
Elinor
wished
to
see
it
,
lasted
a
*NL*
considerable
time
;
and
anxious
to
observe
the
result
of
it
herself
,
she
*NL*
resolved
to
sit
with
her
during
the
whole
of
it
.
Mrs.
Jennings
,
*NL*
knowing
nothing
of
any
change
in
the
patient
,
went
unusually
early
to
*NL*
bed
;
her
maid
,
who
was
one
of
the
principal
nurses
,
was
recreating
*NL*
herself
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
,
and
Elinor
remained
alone
with
*NL*
Marianne
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
repose
of
the
latter
became
more
and
more
disturbed
;
and
her
*NL*
sister
,
who
watched
,
with
unremitting
attention
her
continual
change
of
*NL*
posture
,
and
heard
the
frequent
but
inarticulate
sounds
of
complaint
*NL*
which
passed
her
lips
,
was
almost
wishing
to
rouse
her
from
so
painful
*NL*
a
slumber
,
when
Marianne
,
suddenly
awakened
by
some
accidental
noise
in
*NL*
the
house
,
started
hastily
up
,
and
,
with
feverish
wildness
,
cried
out
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
mama
coming
?
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
''
cried
the
other
,
concealing
her
terror
,
and
assisting
*NL*
Marianne
to
lie
down
again
,
``
but
she
will
be
here
,
I
hope
,
before
it
is
*NL*
long
.
It
is
a
great
way
,
you
know
,
from
hence
to
Barton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
must
not
go
round
by
London
,
''
cried
Marianne
,
in
the
same
*NL*
hurried
manner
.
``
I
shall
never
see
her
,
if
she
goes
by
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
perceived
with
alarm
that
she
was
not
quite
herself
,
and
,
while
*NL*
attempting
to
soothe
her
,
eagerly
felt
her
pulse
.
It
was
lower
and
*NL*
quicker
than
ever
!
and
Marianne
,
still
talking
wildly
of
mama
,
her
*NL*
alarm
increased
so
rapidly
,
as
to
determine
her
on
sending
instantly
*NL*
for
Mr.
Harris
,
and
despatching
a
messenger
to
Barton
for
her
mother
.
*NL*
To
consult
with
Colonel
Brandon
on
the
best
means
of
effecting
the
*NL*
latter
,
was
a
thought
which
immediately
followed
the
resolution
of
its
*NL*
performance
;
and
as
soon
she
had
rung
up
the
maid
to
take
her
place
by
*NL*
her
sister
,
she
hastened
down
to
the
drawing-room
,
where
she
knew
he
*NL*
was
generally
to
be
found
at
a
much
later
hour
than
the
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
time
for
hesitation
.
Her
fears
and
her
difficulties
were
*NL*
immediately
before
him
.
Her
fears
,
he
had
no
courage
,
no
confidence
to
*NL*
attempt
the
removal
of
:
--
he
listened
to
them
in
silent
despondence
;
--
but
*NL*
her
difficulties
were
instantly
obviated
,
for
with
a
readiness
that
*NL*
seemed
to
speak
the
occasion
,
and
the
service
pre-arranged
in
his
mind
,
*NL*
he
offered
himself
as
the
messenger
who
should
fetch
Mrs.
Dashwood
.
*NL*
Elinor
made
no
resistance
that
was
not
easily
overcome
.
She
thanked
him
*NL*
with
brief
,
though
fervent
gratitude
,
and
while
he
went
to
hurry
off
his
*NL*
servant
with
a
message
to
Mr.
Harris
,
and
an
order
for
post-horses
*NL*
directly
,
she
wrote
a
few
lines
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
comfort
of
such
a
friend
at
that
moment
as
Colonel
Brandon
--
or
such
*NL*
a
companion
for
her
mother
,
--
how
gratefully
was
it
felt
!
--
a
companion
*NL*
whose
judgment
would
guide
,
whose
attendance
must
relieve
,
and
whose
*NL*
friendship
might
soothe
her
!
--
as
far
as
the
shock
of
such
a
summons
*NL*
COULD
be
lessened
to
her
,
his
presence
,
his
manners
,
his
assistance
,
*NL*
would
lessen
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
HE
,
meanwhile
,
whatever
he
might
feel
,
acted
with
all
the
firmness
of
a
*NL*
collected
mind
,
made
every
necessary
arrangement
with
the
utmost
*NL*
despatch
,
and
calculated
with
exactness
the
time
in
which
she
might
*NL*
look
for
his
return
.
Not
a
moment
was
lost
in
delay
of
any
kind
.
The
*NL*
horses
arrived
,
even
before
they
were
expected
,
and
Colonel
Brandon
*NL*
only
pressing
her
hand
with
a
look
of
solemnity
,
and
a
few
words
spoken
*NL*
too
low
to
reach
her
ear
,
hurried
into
the
carriage
.
It
was
then
about
*NL*
twelve
o'clock
,
and
she
returned
to
her
sister
's
apartment
to
wait
for
*NL*
the
arrival
of
the
apothecary
,
and
to
watch
by
her
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
night
.
It
was
a
night
of
almost
equal
suffering
to
both
.
Hour
after
*NL*
hour
passed
away
in
sleepless
pain
and
delirium
on
Marianne
's
side
,
and
*NL*
in
the
most
cruel
anxiety
on
Elinor
's
,
before
Mr.
Harris
appeared
.
Her
*NL*
apprehensions
once
raised
,
paid
by
their
excess
for
all
her
former
*NL*
security
;
and
the
servant
who
sat
up
with
her
,
for
she
would
not
allow
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
to
be
called
,
only
tortured
her
more
,
by
hints
of
what
*NL*
her
mistress
had
always
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
's
ideas
were
still
,
at
intervals
,
fixed
incoherently
on
her
*NL*
mother
,
and
whenever
she
mentioned
her
name
,
it
gave
a
pang
to
the
*NL*
heart
of
poor
Elinor
,
who
,
reproaching
herself
for
having
trifled
with
*NL*
so
many
days
of
illness
,
and
wretched
for
some
immediate
relief
,
*NL*
fancied
that
all
relief
might
soon
be
in
vain
,
that
every
thing
had
*NL*
been
delayed
too
long
,
and
pictured
to
herself
her
suffering
mother
*NL*
arriving
too
late
to
see
this
darling
child
,
or
to
see
her
rational
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
on
the
point
of
sending
again
for
Mr.
Harris
,
or
if
HE
could
*NL*
not
come
,
for
some
other
advice
,
when
the
former
--
but
not
till
after
*NL*
five
o'clock
--
arrived
.
His
opinion
,
however
,
made
some
little
amends
*NL*
for
his
delay
,
for
though
acknowledging
a
very
unexpected
and
*NL*
unpleasant
alteration
in
his
patient
,
he
would
not
allow
the
danger
to
*NL*
be
material
,
and
talked
of
the
relief
which
a
fresh
mode
of
treatment
*NL*
must
procure
,
with
a
confidence
which
,
in
a
lesser
degree
,
was
*NL*
communicated
to
Elinor
.
He
promised
to
call
again
in
the
course
of
*NL*
three
or
four
hours
,
and
left
both
the
patient
and
her
anxious
*NL*
attendant
more
composed
than
he
had
found
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
strong
concern
,
and
with
many
reproaches
for
not
being
called
to
*NL*
their
aid
,
did
Mrs.
Jennings
hear
in
the
morning
of
what
had
passed
.
*NL*
Her
former
apprehensions
,
now
with
greater
reason
restored
,
left
her
no
*NL*
doubt
of
the
event
;
and
though
trying
to
speak
comfort
to
Elinor
,
her
*NL*
conviction
of
her
sister
's
danger
would
not
allow
her
to
offer
the
*NL*
comfort
of
hope
.
Her
heart
was
really
grieved
.
The
rapid
decay
,
the
*NL*
early
death
of
a
girl
so
young
,
so
lovely
as
Marianne
,
must
have
struck
*NL*
a
less
interested
person
with
concern
.
On
Mrs.
Jennings
's
compassion
*NL*
she
had
other
claims
.
She
had
been
for
three
months
her
companion
,
was
*NL*
still
under
her
care
,
and
she
was
known
to
have
been
greatly
injured
,
*NL*
and
long
unhappy
.
The
distress
of
her
sister
too
,
particularly
a
*NL*
favourite
,
was
before
her
;
--
and
as
for
their
mother
,
when
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
considered
that
Marianne
might
probably
be
to
HER
what
Charlotte
was
to
*NL*
herself
,
her
sympathy
in
HER
sufferings
was
very
sincere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Harris
was
punctual
in
his
second
visit
;
--
but
he
came
to
be
*NL*
disappointed
in
his
hopes
of
what
the
last
would
produce
.
His
*NL*
medicines
had
failed
;
--
the
fever
was
unabated
;
and
Marianne
only
more
*NL*
quiet
--
not
more
herself
--
remained
in
a
heavy
stupor
.
Elinor
,
catching
*NL*
all
,
and
more
than
all
,
his
fears
in
a
moment
,
proposed
to
call
in
*NL*
further
advice
.
But
he
judged
it
unnecessary
:
he
had
still
something
*NL*
more
to
try
,
some
more
fresh
application
,
of
whose
success
he
was
as
*NL*
confident
as
the
last
,
and
his
visit
concluded
with
encouraging
*NL*
assurances
which
reached
the
ear
,
but
could
not
enter
the
heart
of
Miss
*NL*
Dashwood
.
She
was
calm
,
except
when
she
thought
of
her
mother
;
but
she
*NL*
was
almost
hopeless
;
and
in
this
state
she
continued
till
noon
,
*NL*
scarcely
stirring
from
her
sister
's
bed
,
her
thoughts
wandering
from
*NL*
one
image
of
grief
,
one
suffering
friend
to
another
,
and
her
spirits
*NL*
oppressed
to
the
utmost
by
the
conversation
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
who
*NL*
scrupled
not
to
attribute
the
severity
and
danger
of
this
attack
to
the
*NL*
many
weeks
of
previous
indisposition
which
Marianne
's
disappointment
*NL*
had
brought
on
.
Elinor
felt
all
the
reasonableness
of
the
idea
,
and
it
*NL*
gave
fresh
misery
to
her
reflections
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
noon
,
however
,
she
began
--
but
with
a
caution
--
a
dread
of
*NL*
disappointment
which
for
some
time
kept
her
silent
,
even
to
her
*NL*
friend
--
to
fancy
,
to
hope
she
could
perceive
a
slight
amendment
in
her
*NL*
sister
's
pulse
;
--
she
waited
,
watched
,
and
examined
it
again
and
*NL*
again
;
--
and
at
last
,
with
an
agitation
more
difficult
to
bury
under
*NL*
exterior
calmness
,
than
all
her
foregoing
distress
,
ventured
to
*NL*
communicate
her
hopes
.
Mrs.
Jennings
,
though
forced
,
on
examination
,
*NL*
to
acknowledge
a
temporary
revival
,
tried
to
keep
her
young
friend
from
*NL*
indulging
a
thought
of
its
continuance
;
--
and
Elinor
,
conning
over
every
*NL*
injunction
of
distrust
,
told
herself
likewise
not
to
hope
.
But
it
was
*NL*
too
late
.
Hope
had
already
entered
;
and
feeling
all
its
anxious
*NL*
flutter
,
she
bent
over
her
sister
to
watch
--
she
hardly
knew
for
what
.
*NL*
Half
an
hour
passed
away
,
and
the
favourable
symptom
yet
blessed
her
.
*NL*
Others
even
arose
to
confirm
it
.
Her
breath
,
her
skin
,
her
lips
,
all
*NL*
flattered
Elinor
with
signs
of
amendment
;
and
Marianne
fixed
her
eyes
*NL*
on
her
with
a
rational
,
though
languid
,
gaze
.
Anxiety
and
hope
now
*NL*
oppressed
her
in
equal
degrees
,
and
left
her
no
moment
of
tranquillity
*NL*
till
the
arrival
of
Mr.
Harris
at
four
o'clock
;
--
when
his
assurances
,
*NL*
his
felicitations
on
a
recovery
in
her
sister
even
surpassing
his
*NL*
expectation
,
gave
her
confidence
,
comfort
,
and
tears
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
was
in
every
respect
materially
better
,
and
he
declared
her
*NL*
entirely
out
of
danger
.
Mrs.
Jennings
,
perhaps
satisfied
with
the
*NL*
partial
justification
of
her
forebodings
which
had
been
found
in
their
*NL*
late
alarm
,
allowed
herself
to
trust
in
his
judgment
,
and
admitted
,
*NL*
with
unfeigned
joy
,
and
soon
with
unequivocal
cheerfulness
,
the
*NL*
probability
of
an
entire
recovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
not
be
cheerful
.
Her
joy
was
of
a
different
kind
,
and
led
*NL*
to
any
thing
rather
than
to
gaiety
.
Marianne
restored
to
life
,
health
,
*NL*
friends
,
and
to
her
doting
mother
,
was
an
idea
to
fill
her
heart
with
*NL*
sensations
of
exquisite
comfort
,
and
expand
it
in
fervent
*NL*
gratitude
;
--
but
it
led
to
no
outward
demonstrations
of
joy
,
no
words
,
*NL*
no
smiles
.
All
within
Elinor
's
breast
was
satisfaction
,
silent
and
*NL*
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
by
the
side
of
her
sister
,
with
little
intermission
the
*NL*
whole
afternoon
,
calming
every
fear
,
satisfying
every
inquiry
of
her
*NL*
enfeebled
spirits
,
supplying
every
succour
,
and
watching
almost
every
*NL*
look
and
every
breath
.
The
possibility
of
a
relapse
would
of
course
,
*NL*
in
some
moments
,
occur
to
remind
her
of
what
anxiety
was
--
but
when
she
*NL*
saw
,
on
her
frequent
and
minute
examination
,
that
every
symptom
of
*NL*
recovery
continued
,
and
saw
Marianne
at
six
o'clock
sink
into
a
quiet
,
*NL*
steady
,
and
to
all
appearance
comfortable
,
sleep
,
she
silenced
every
*NL*
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
was
now
drawing
on
,
when
Colonel
Brandon
might
be
expected
*NL*
back
.
At
ten
o'clock
,
she
trusted
,
or
at
least
not
much
later
her
*NL*
mother
would
be
relieved
from
the
dreadful
suspense
in
which
she
must
*NL*
now
be
travelling
towards
them
.
The
Colonel
,
too
!
--
perhaps
scarcely
*NL*
less
an
object
of
pity
!
--
Oh
!
--
how
slow
was
the
progress
of
time
which
*NL*
yet
kept
them
in
ignorance
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
seven
o'clock
,
leaving
Marianne
still
sweetly
asleep
,
she
joined
*NL*
Mrs.
Jennings
in
the
drawing-room
to
tea
.
Of
breakfast
she
had
been
*NL*
kept
by
her
fears
,
and
of
dinner
by
their
sudden
reverse
,
from
eating
*NL*
much
;
--
and
the
present
refreshment
,
therefore
,
with
such
feelings
of
*NL*
content
as
she
brought
to
it
,
was
particularly
welcome
.
Mrs.
Jennings
*NL*
would
have
persuaded
her
,
at
its
conclusion
,
to
take
some
rest
before
*NL*
her
mother
's
arrival
,
and
allow
HER
to
take
her
place
by
Marianne
;
but
*NL*
Elinor
had
no
sense
of
fatigue
,
no
capability
of
sleep
at
that
moment
*NL*
about
her
,
and
she
was
not
to
be
kept
away
from
her
sister
an
*NL*
unnecessary
instant
.
Mrs.
Jennings
therefore
attending
her
up
stairs
*NL*
into
the
sick
chamber
,
to
satisfy
herself
that
all
continued
right
,
*NL*
left
her
there
again
to
her
charge
and
her
thoughts
,
and
retired
to
her
*NL*
own
room
to
write
letters
and
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
cold
and
stormy
.
The
wind
roared
round
the
house
,
and
*NL*
the
rain
beat
against
the
windows
;
but
Elinor
,
all
happiness
within
,
*NL*
regarded
it
not
.
Marianne
slept
through
every
blast
;
and
the
*NL*
travellers
--
they
had
a
rich
reward
in
store
,
for
every
present
*NL*
inconvenience
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
struck
eight
.
Had
it
been
ten
,
Elinor
would
have
been
*NL*
convinced
that
at
that
moment
she
heard
a
carriage
driving
up
to
the
*NL*
house
;
and
so
strong
was
the
persuasion
that
she
DID
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
ALMOST
impossibility
of
their
being
already
come
,
that
she
moved
into
*NL*
the
adjoining
dressing-closet
and
opened
a
window
shutter
,
to
be
*NL*
satisfied
of
the
truth
.
She
instantly
saw
that
her
ears
had
not
*NL*
deceived
her
.
The
flaring
lamps
of
a
carriage
were
immediately
in
*NL*
view
.
By
their
uncertain
light
she
thought
she
could
discern
it
to
be
*NL*
drawn
by
four
horses
;
and
this
,
while
it
told
the
excess
of
her
poor
*NL*
mother
's
alarm
,
gave
some
explanation
to
such
unexpected
rapidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
in
her
life
had
Elinor
found
it
so
difficult
to
be
calm
,
as
at
*NL*
that
moment
.
The
knowledge
of
what
her
mother
must
be
feeling
as
the
*NL*
carriage
stopt
at
the
door
--
of
her
doubt
--
her
dread
--
perhaps
her
*NL*
despair
!
--
and
of
what
SHE
had
to
tell
!
--
with
such
knowledge
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
be
calm
.
All
that
remained
to
be
done
was
to
be
speedy
;
*NL*
and
,
therefore
staying
only
till
she
could
leave
Mrs.
Jennings
's
maid
*NL*
with
her
sister
,
she
hurried
down
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bustle
in
the
vestibule
,
as
she
passed
along
an
inner
lobby
,
*NL*
assured
her
that
they
were
already
in
the
house
.
She
rushed
to
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
--
she
entered
it
,
--
and
saw
only
Willoughby
.

CHAPTER
44
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
starting
back
with
a
look
of
horror
at
the
sight
of
him
,
obeyed
*NL*
the
first
impulse
of
her
heart
in
turning
instantly
to
quit
the
room
,
*NL*
and
her
hand
was
already
on
the
lock
,
when
its
action
was
suspended
by
*NL*
his
hastily
advancing
,
and
saying
,
in
a
voice
rather
of
command
than
*NL*
supplication
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Dashwood
,
for
half
an
hour
--
for
ten
minutes
--
I
entreat
you
to
*NL*
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
she
replied
with
firmness
,
``
I
shall
NOT
stay
.
Your
business
*NL*
can
not
be
with
ME
.
The
servants
,
I
suppose
,
forgot
to
tell
you
that
*NL*
Mr.
Palmer
was
not
in
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
they
told
me
,
''
he
cried
with
vehemence
,
``
that
Mr.
Palmer
and
all
*NL*
his
relations
were
at
the
devil
,
it
would
not
have
turned
me
from
the
*NL*
door
.
My
business
is
with
you
,
and
only
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
me
!
''
--
in
the
utmost
amazement
--
``
well
,
sir
,
--
be
quick
--
and
if
you
*NL*
can
--
less
violent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
and
I
will
be
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
;
she
knew
not
what
to
do
.
The
possibility
of
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
's
arriving
and
finding
her
there
,
came
across
her
.
But
she
had
*NL*
promised
to
hear
him
,
and
her
curiosity
no
less
than
her
honor
was
*NL*
engaged
.
After
a
moment
's
recollection
,
therefore
,
concluding
that
*NL*
prudence
required
dispatch
,
and
that
her
acquiescence
would
best
*NL*
promote
it
,
she
walked
silently
towards
the
table
,
and
sat
down
.
He
*NL*
took
the
opposite
chair
,
and
for
half
a
minute
not
a
word
was
said
by
*NL*
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
be
quick
,
sir
,
''
--
said
Elinor
,
impatiently
;
--
``
I
have
no
time
to
*NL*
spare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sitting
in
an
attitude
of
deep
meditation
,
and
seemed
not
to
*NL*
hear
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sister
,
''
said
he
,
with
abruptness
,
a
moment
afterwards
--
``
is
out
*NL*
of
danger
.
I
heard
it
from
the
servant
.
God
be
praised
!
--
But
is
it
*NL*
true
?
is
it
really
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
would
not
speak
.
He
repeated
the
inquiry
with
yet
greater
*NL*
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
God
's
sake
tell
me
,
is
she
out
of
danger
,
or
is

He
rose
up
,
and
walked
across
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
I
known
as
much
half
an
hour
ago

But
since
I
AM

speaking

with
a
forced
vivacity
as
he
returned
to
his
seat

it

signify

For

a
deeper
glow
overspreading
his
*NL*
cheeks

you
think
me
most
a
knave

a
fool

*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
looked
at
him
with
greater
astonishment
than
ever
.
She
began
to
*NL*
think
that
he
must
be
in
liquor
;
--
the
strangeness
of
such
a
visit
,
and
*NL*
of
such
manners
,
seemed
no
otherwise
intelligible
;
and
with
this
*NL*
impression
she
immediately
rose
,
saying
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Willoughby
,
I
advise
you
at
present
to
return
to
Combe

I
am
not
*NL*
at
leisure
to
remain
with
you

Whatever
your
business
may
be

with
me

it
will
be
better
recollected

explained
to-morrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
you

he
replied
,
with
an
expressive
smile
,
and
a
voice
*NL*
perfectly
calm
;
``
yes
,
I
am
very
drunk

A
pint
of
porter
with
my
cold
*NL*
beef
at
Marlborough
was
enough
to
over-set
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Marlborough
!

cried
Elinor
,
more
and
more
at
a
loss
to
understand
*NL*
what
he
would
be
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
left
London
this
morning
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
the
only
ten
*NL*
minutes
I
have
spent
out
of
my
chaise
since
that
time
procured
me
a
*NL*
nuncheon
at
Marlborough

*NL*
*NL*
The
steadiness
of
his
manner
,
and
the
intelligence
of
his
eye
as
he
*NL*
spoke
,
convincing
Elinor
,
that
whatever
other
unpardonable
folly
might
*NL*
bring
him
to
Cleveland
,
he
was
not
brought
there
by
intoxication

she
*NL*
said
,
after
a
moment
's
recollection
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Willoughby
,
you
OUGHT
to
feel
,

I
certainly
DO

that
after
what
*NL*
has
passed
--
your
coming
here
in
this
manner
,
and
forcing
yourself
upon
*NL*
my
notice
,
requires
a
very
particular
excuse

What
is
it

that
you
*NL*

by
it

*NL*
*NL*

with
serious
energy

offer
some
kind
of

explanation

some
kind
of
apology

for
the
past

to
open
my
whole
heart
*NL*
to
you

by
convincing
you

that

I
have
been
always
a
*NL*
blockhead

I
have
not
been
always
a
rascal

obtain
something

forgiveness
from

from
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
the
real
reason
of
your
coming

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul
it
is
,
''
--
was
his
answer
,
with
a
warmth
which
brought
all
*NL*
the
former
Willoughby
to
her
remembrance
,
and
in
spite
of
herself
made
*NL*
her
think
him
sincere

*NL*
``
If
that
is
all

you
may
be
satisfied
already

*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
?

he
cried
,
in
the
same
eager
tone
.
--
``
Then
she
has
forgiven
*NL*
me
before
she
ought
to
have
done
it
.
But
she
shall
forgive
me
again
,
*NL*
and
on
more
reasonable
grounds
.
--
NOW
will
you
listen
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
bowed
her
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
''
said
he
,
after
a
pause
of
expectation
on
her
side
,
and
*NL*
thoughtfulness
on
his
own
,
--
``
how
YOU
may
have
accounted
for
my
*NL*
behaviour
to
your
sister
,
or
what
diabolical
motive
you
may
have
*NL*
imputed
to
me
.
--
Perhaps
you
will
hardly
think
the
better
of
me
,
--
it
is
*NL*
worth
the
trial
however
,
and
you
shall
hear
every
thing
.
When
I
first
*NL*
became
intimate
in
your
family
,
I
had
no
other
intention
,
no
other
view
*NL*
in
the
acquaintance
than
to
pass
my
time
pleasantly
while
I
was
obliged
*NL*
to
remain
in
Devonshire
,
more
pleasantly
than
I
had
ever
done
before
.
*NL*
Your
sister
's
lovely
person
and
interesting
manners
could
not
but
*NL*
please
me
;
and
her
behaviour
to
me
almost
from
the
first
,
was
of
a
*NL*
kind
--
It
is
astonishing
,
when
I
reflect
on
what
it
was
,
and
what
SHE
*NL*
was
,
that
my
heart
should
have
been
so
insensible
!
But
at
first
I
must
*NL*
confess
,
my
vanity
only
was
elevated
by
it
.
Careless
of
her
happiness
,
*NL*
thinking
only
of
my
own
amusement
,
giving
way
to
feelings
which
I
had
*NL*
always
been
too
much
in
the
habit
of
indulging
,
I
endeavoured
,
by
every
*NL*
means
in
my
power
,
to
make
myself
pleasing
to
her
,
without
any
design
*NL*
of
returning
her
affection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Dashwood
,
at
this
point
,
turning
her
eyes
on
him
with
the
most
*NL*
angry
contempt
,
stopped
him
,
by
saying
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
hardly
worth
while
,
Mr.
Willoughby
,
for
you
to
relate
,
or
for
me
*NL*
to
listen
any
longer
.
Such
a
beginning
as
this
can
not
be
followed
by
*NL*
any
thing
.
--
Do
not
let
me
be
pained
by
hearing
any
thing
more
on
the
*NL*
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
insist
on
you
hearing
the
whole
of
it
,
''
he
replied
,
``
My
fortune
was
*NL*
never
large
,
and
I
had
always
been
expensive
,
always
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
associating
with
people
of
better
income
than
myself
.
Every
year
since
*NL*
my
coming
of
age
,
or
even
before
,
I
believe
,
had
added
to
my
debts
;
and
*NL*
though
the
death
of
my
old
cousin
,
Mrs.
Smith
,
was
to
set
me
free
;
yet
*NL*
that
event
being
uncertain
,
and
possibly
far
distant
,
it
had
been
for
*NL*
some
time
my
intention
to
re-establish
my
circumstances
by
marrying
a
*NL*
woman
of
fortune
.
To
attach
myself
to
your
sister
,
therefore
,
was
not
*NL*
a
thing
to
be
thought
of
;
--
and
with
a
meanness
,
selfishness
,
*NL*
cruelty
--
which
no
indignant
,
no
contemptuous
look
,
even
of
yours
,
Miss
*NL*
Dashwood
,
can
ever
reprobate
too
much
--
I
was
acting
in
this
manner
,
*NL*
trying
to
engage
her
regard
,
without
a
thought
of
returning
it
.
--
But
*NL*
one
thing
may
be
said
for
me
:
even
in
that
horrid
state
of
selfish
*NL*
vanity
,
I
did
not
know
the
extent
of
the
injury
I
meditated
,
because
I
*NL*
did
not
THEN
know
what
it
was
to
love
.
But
have
I
ever
known
it
?
--
Well
*NL*
may
it
be
doubted
;
for
,
had
I
really
loved
,
could
I
have
sacrificed
my
*NL*
feelings
to
vanity
,
to
avarice
?
--
or
,
what
is
more
,
could
I
have
*NL*
sacrificed
hers
?
--
But
I
have
done
it
.
To
avoid
a
comparative
poverty
,
*NL*
which
her
affection
and
her
society
would
have
deprived
of
all
its
*NL*
horrors
,
I
have
,
by
raising
myself
to
affluence
,
lost
every
thing
that
*NL*
could
make
it
a
blessing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
then
,
''
said
Elinor
,
a
little
softened
,
``
believe
yourself
at
*NL*
one
time
attached
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
have
resisted
such
attractions
,
to
have
withstood
such
*NL*
tenderness
!
--
Is
there
a
man
on
earth
who
could
have
done
it
?
--
Yes
,
I
*NL*
found
myself
,
by
insensible
degrees
,
sincerely
fond
of
her
;
and
the
*NL*
happiest
hours
of
my
life
were
what
I
spent
with
her
when
I
felt
my
*NL*
intentions
were
strictly
honourable
,
and
my
feelings
blameless
.
Even
*NL*
THEN
,
however
,
when
fully
determined
on
paying
my
addresses
to
her
,
I
*NL*
allowed
myself
most
improperly
to
put
off
,
from
day
to
day
,
the
moment
*NL*
of
doing
it
,
from
an
unwillingness
to
enter
into
an
engagement
while
my
*NL*
circumstances
were
so
greatly
embarrassed
.
I
will
not
reason
here
--
nor
*NL*
will
I
stop
for
YOU
to
expatiate
on
the
absurdity
,
and
the
worse
than
*NL*
absurdity
,
of
scrupling
to
engage
my
faith
where
my
honour
was
already
*NL*
bound
.
The
event
has
proved
,
that
I
was
a
cunning
fool
,
providing
with
*NL*
great
circumspection
for
a
possible
opportunity
of
making
myself
*NL*
contemptible
and
wretched
for
ever
.
At
last
,
however
,
my
resolution
*NL*
was
taken
,
and
I
had
determined
,
as
soon
as
I
could
engage
her
alone
,
*NL*
to
justify
the
attentions
I
had
so
invariably
paid
her
,
and
openly
*NL*
assure
her
of
an
affection
which
I
had
already
taken
such
pains
to
*NL*
display
.
But
in
the
interim
--
in
the
interim
of
the
very
few
hours
that
*NL*
were
to
pass
,
before
I
could
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
with
her
*NL*
in
private
--
a
circumstance
occurred
--
an
unlucky
circumstance
,
to
ruin
*NL*
all
my
resolution
,
and
with
it
all
my
comfort
.
A
discovery
took
*NL*
place
,
''
--
here
he
hesitated
and
looked
down
.
--
``
Mrs.
Smith
had
somehow
or
*NL*
other
been
informed
,
I
imagine
by
some
distant
relation
,
whose
interest
*NL*
it
was
to
deprive
me
of
her
favour
,
of
an
affair
,
a
connection
--
but
I
*NL*
need
not
explain
myself
farther
,
''
he
added
,
looking
at
her
with
an
*NL*
heightened
colour
and
an
enquiring
eye
--
``
your
particular
intimacy
--
you
*NL*
have
probably
heard
the
whole
story
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
''
returned
Elinor
,
colouring
likewise
,
and
hardening
her
heart
*NL*
anew
against
any
compassion
for
him
,
``
I
have
heard
it
all
.
And
how
you
*NL*
will
explain
away
any
part
of
your
guilt
in
that
dreadful
business
,
I
*NL*
confess
is
beyond
my
comprehension
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
''
cried
Willoughby
,
``
from
whom
you
received
the
account
.
*NL*
Could
it
be
an
impartial
one
?
I
acknowledge
that
her
situation
and
her
*NL*
character
ought
to
have
been
respected
by
me
.
I
do
not
mean
to
justify
*NL*
myself
,
but
at
the
same
time
can
not
leave
you
to
suppose
that
I
have
*NL*
nothing
to
urge
--
that
because
she
was
injured
she
was
irreproachable
,
*NL*
and
because
I
was
a
libertine
,
SHE
must
be
a
saint

If
the
violence
of
*NL*
her
passions
,
the
weakness
of
her
understanding
--
I
do
not
mean
,
*NL*
however
,
to
defend
myself

Her
affection
for
me
deserved
better
*NL*
treatment
,
and
I
often
,
with
great
self-reproach
,
recall
the
tenderness
*NL*

,
for
a
very
short
time
,
had
the
power
of
creating
any
return

I
*NL*
wish

I
heartily
wish
it
had
never
been
.
But
I
have
injured
more
than
*NL*
herself
;
and
I
have
injured
one
,
whose
affection
for
me
--
-LRB-
may
I
say
*NL*
it
?
-RRB-
was
scarcely
less
warm
than
hers
;
and
whose
mind
--
Oh
!
how
*NL*
infinitely
superior
!
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
indifference
,
however
,
towards
that
unfortunate
girl
--
I
must
say
*NL*
it
,
unpleasant
to
me
as
the
discussion
of
such
a
subject
may
well
*NL*
be
--
your
indifference
is
no
apology
for
your
cruel
neglect
of
her
.
Do
*NL*
not
think
yourself
excused
by
any
weakness
,
any
natural
defect
of
*NL*
understanding
on
her
side
,
in
the
wanton
cruelty
so
evident
on
yours

*NL*
You
must
have
known

that
while
you
were
enjoying
yourself
in
*NL*
Devonshire
pursuing
fresh
schemes
,
always
gay
,
always
happy
,
she
was
*NL*
reduced
to
the
extremest
indigence

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
upon
my
soul
,
I
did
NOT
know
it
,
''
he
warmly
replied
;
``
I
did
not
*NL*
recollect
that
I
had
omitted
to
give
her
my
direction
;
and
common
sense
*NL*
might
have
told
her
how
to
find
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
and
what
said
Mrs.
Smith
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
taxed
me
with
the
offence
at
once
,
and
my
confusion
may
be
*NL*
guessed
.
The
purity
of
her
life
,
the
formality
of
her
notions
,
her
*NL*
ignorance
of
the
world
--
every
thing
was
against
me
.
The
matter
itself
*NL*
I
could
not
deny
,
and
vain
was
every
endeavour
to
soften
it
.
She
was
*NL*
previously
disposed
,
I
believe
,
to
doubt
the
morality
of
my
conduct
in
*NL*
general
,
and
was
moreover
discontented
with
the
very
little
attention
,
*NL*
the
very
little
portion
of
my
time
that
I
had
bestowed
on
her
,
in
my
*NL*
present
visit
.
In
short
,
it
ended
in
a
total
breach
.
By
one
measure
I
*NL*
might
have
saved
myself
.
In
the
height
of
her
morality
,
good
woman
!
*NL*
she
offered
to
forgive
the
past
,
if
I
would
marry
Eliza
.
That
could
*NL*
not
be
--
and
I
was
formally
dismissed
from
her
favour
and
her
house
.
*NL*
The
night
following
this
affair
--
I
was
to
go
the
next
morning
--
was
*NL*
spent
by
me
in
deliberating
on
what
my
future
conduct
should
be
.
The
*NL*
struggle
was
great
--
but
it
ended
too
soon
.
My
affection
for
Marianne
,
*NL*
my
thorough
conviction
of
her
attachment
to
me
--
it
was
all
insufficient
*NL*
to
outweigh
that
dread
of
poverty
,
or
get
the
better
of
those
false
*NL*
ideas
of
the
necessity
of
riches
,
which
I
was
naturally
inclined
to
*NL*
feel
,
and
expensive
society
had
increased
.
I
had
reason
to
believe
*NL*
myself
secure
of
my
present
wife
,
if
I
chose
to
address
her
,
and
I
*NL*
persuaded
myself
to
think
that
nothing
else
in
common
prudence
remained
*NL*
for
me
to
do
.
A
heavy
scene
however
awaited
me
,
before
I
could
leave
*NL*
Devonshire
;
--
I
was
engaged
to
dine
with
you
on
that
very
day
;
some
*NL*
apology
was
therefore
necessary
for
my
breaking
this
engagement
.
But
*NL*
whether
I
should
write
this
apology
,
or
deliver
it
in
person
,
was
a
*NL*
point
of
long
debate
.
To
see
Marianne
,
I
felt
,
would
be
dreadful
,
and
*NL*
I
even
doubted
whether
I
could
see
her
again
,
and
keep
to
my
*NL*
resolution
.
In
that
point
,
however
,
I
undervalued
my
own
magnanimity
,
*NL*
as
the
event
declared
;
for
I
went
,
I
saw
her
,
and
saw
her
miserable
,
*NL*
and
left
her
miserable
--
and
left
her
hoping
never
to
see
her
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
call
,
Mr.
Willoughby
?
''
said
Elinor
,
reproachfully
;
``
a
note
*NL*
would
have
answered
every
purpose
.
--
Why
was
it
necessary
to
call
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
necessary
to
my
own
pride
.
I
could
not
bear
to
leave
the
*NL*
country
in
a
manner
that
might
lead
you
,
or
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
to
suspect
any
part
of
what
had
really
passed
between
*NL*
Mrs.
Smith
and
myself
--
and
I
resolved
therefore
on
calling
at
the
*NL*
cottage
,
in
my
way
to
Honiton
.
The
sight
of
your
dear
sister
,
however
,
*NL*
was
really
dreadful
;
and
,
to
heighten
the
matter
,
I
found
her
alone
.
*NL*
You
were
all
gone
I
do
not
know
where
.
I
had
left
her
only
the
evening
*NL*
before
,
so
fully
,
so
firmly
resolved
within
my
self
on
doing
right
!
A
*NL*
few
hours
were
to
have
engaged
her
to
me
for
ever
;
and
I
remember
how
*NL*
happy
,
how
gay
were
my
spirits
,
as
I
walked
from
the
cottage
to
*NL*
Allenham
,
satisfied
with
myself
,
delighted
with
every
body
!
But
in
*NL*
this
,
our
last
interview
of
friendship
,
I
approached
her
with
a
sense
*NL*
of
guilt
that
almost
took
from
me
the
power
of
dissembling
.
Her
*NL*
sorrow
,
her
disappointment
,
her
deep
regret
,
when
I
told
her
that
I
was
*NL*
obliged
to
leave
Devonshire
so
immediately
--
I
never
shall
forget
*NL*
it
--
united
too
with
such
reliance
,
such
confidence
in
me
!
--
Oh
,
*NL*
God
!
--
what
a
hard-hearted
rascal
I
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
silent
for
a
few
moments
.
Elinor
first
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
tell
her
that
you
should
soon
return
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
I
told
her
,
''
he
replied
,
impatiently
;
``
less
than
*NL*
was
due
to
the
past
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
and
in
all
likelihood
much
more
*NL*
than
was
justified
by
the
future
.
I
can
not
think
of
it
.
--
It
wo
n't
*NL*
do
.
--
Then
came
your
dear
mother
to
torture
me
farther
,
with
all
her
*NL*
kindness
and
confidence
.
Thank
Heaven
!
it
DID
torture
me
.
I
was
*NL*
miserable
.
Miss
Dashwood
,
you
can
not
have
an
idea
of
the
comfort
it
*NL*
gives
me
to
look
back
on
my
own
misery
.
I
owe
such
a
grudge
to
myself
*NL*
for
the
stupid
,
rascally
folly
of
my
own
heart
,
that
all
my
past
*NL*
sufferings
under
it
are
only
triumph
and
exultation
to
me
now
.
Well
,
I
*NL*
went
,
left
all
that
I
loved
,
and
went
to
those
to
whom
,
at
best
,
I
was
*NL*
only
indifferent
.
My
journey
to
town
--
travelling
with
my
own
horses
,
*NL*
and
therefore
so
tediously
--
no
creature
to
speak
to
--
my
own
reflections
*NL*
so
cheerful
--
when
I
looked
forward
every
thing
so
inviting
!
--
when
I
*NL*
looked
back
at
Barton
,
the
picture
so
soothing
!
--
oh
,
it
was
a
blessed
*NL*
journey
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
Elinor
,
who
,
though
pitying
him
,
grew
impatient
for
*NL*
his
departure
,
``
and
this
is
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
--
no
,

have
you
forgot
what
passed
in
town
?

That
infamous
*NL*
letter

Did
she
shew
it
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
saw
every
note
that
passed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
first
of
hers
reached
me
-LRB-
as
it
immediately
did
,
for
I
was
in
*NL*
town
the
whole
time
,
-RRB-
what
I
felt
is
--
in
the
common
phrase
,
not
to
be
*NL*
expressed
;
in
a
more
simple
one
--
perhaps
too
simple
to
raise
any
*NL*
emotion
--
my
feelings
were
very
,
very
painful
.
--
Every
line
,
every
word
*NL*
was
--
in
the
hackneyed
metaphor
which
their
dear
writer
,
were
she
here
,
*NL*
would
forbid
--
a
dagger
to
my
heart
.
To
know
that
Marianne
was
in
town
*NL*
was
--
in
the
same
language
--
a
thunderbolt
.
--
Thunderbolts
and
*NL*
daggers
!
--
what
a
reproof
would
she
have
given
me
!
--
her
taste
,
her
*NL*
opinions
--
I
believe
they
are
better
known
to
me
than
my
own
,
--
and
I
am
*NL*
sure
they
are
dearer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
heart
,
which
had
undergone
many
changes
in
the
course
of
this
*NL*
extraordinary
conversation
,
was
now
softened
again
;
--
yet
she
felt
it
*NL*
her
duty
to
check
such
ideas
in
her
companion
as
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
right
,
Mr.
Willoughby

you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marianne
's
note
,
by
assuring
me
that
I
was
still
as
dear
to
her
as
in
*NL*
former
days
,
that
in
spite
of
the
many
,
many
weeks
we
had
been
*NL*
separated
,
she
was
as
constant
in
her
own
feelings
,
and
as
full
of
*NL*
faith
in
the
constancy
of
mine
as
ever
,
awakened
all
my
remorse
.
I
say
*NL*
awakened
,
because
time
and
London
,
business
and
dissipation
,
had
in
*NL*
some
measure
quieted
it
,
and
I
had
been
growing
a
fine
hardened
*NL*
villain
,
fancying
myself
indifferent
to
her
,
and
chusing
to
fancy
that
*NL*
she
too
must
have
become
indifferent
to
me
;
talking
to
myself
of
our
*NL*
past
attachment
as
a
mere
idle
,
trifling
business
,
shrugging
up
my
*NL*
shoulders
in
proof
of
its
being
so
,
and
silencing
every
reproach
,
*NL*
overcoming
every
scruple
,
by
secretly
saying
now
and
then
,
'
I
shall
be
*NL*
heartily
glad
to
hear
she
is
well
married
.
'
--
But
this
note
made
me
*NL*
know
myself
better
.
I
felt
that
she
was
infinitely
dearer
to
me
than
*NL*
any
other
woman
in
the
world
,
and
that
I
was
using
her
infamously
.
But
*NL*
every
thing
was
then
just
settled
between
Miss
Grey
and
me
.
To
retreat
*NL*
was
impossible
.
All
that
I
had
to
do
,
was
to
avoid
you
both
.
I
sent
*NL*
no
answer
to
Marianne
,
intending
by
that
to
preserve
myself
from
her
*NL*
farther
notice
;
and
for
some
time
I
was
even
determined
not
to
call
in
*NL*
Berkeley
Street
;
--
but
at
last
,
judging
it
wiser
to
affect
the
air
of
a
*NL*
cool
,
common
acquaintance
than
anything
else
,
I
watched
you
all
safely
*NL*
out
of
the
house
one
morning
,
and
left
my
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Watched
us
out
of
the
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
.
You
would
be
surprised
to
hear
how
often
I
watched
you
,
how
*NL*
often
I
was
on
the
point
of
falling
in
with
you
.
I
have
entered
many
a
*NL*
shop
to
avoid
your
sight
,
as
the
carriage
drove
by
.
Lodging
as
I
did
*NL*
in
Bond
Street
,
there
was
hardly
a
day
in
which
I
did
not
catch
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
one
or
other
of
you
;
and
nothing
but
the
most
constant
*NL*
watchfulness
on
my
side
,
a
most
invariably
prevailing
desire
to
keep
*NL*
out
of
your
sight
,
could
have
separated
us
so
long
.
I
avoided
the
*NL*
Middletons
as
much
as
possible
,
as
well
as
everybody
else
who
was
*NL*
likely
to
prove
an
acquaintance
in
common
.
Not
aware
of
their
being
in
*NL*
town
,
however
,
I
blundered
on
Sir
John
,
I
believe
,
the
first
day
of
his
*NL*
coming
,
and
the
day
after
I
had
called
at
Mrs.
Jennings
's
.
He
asked
me
*NL*
to
a
party
,
a
dance
at
his
house
in
the
evening
.
--
Had
he
NOT
told
me
as
*NL*
an
inducement
that
you
and
your
sister
were
to
be
there
,
I
should
have
*NL*
felt
it
too
certain
a
thing
,
to
trust
myself
near
him
.
The
next
*NL*
morning
brought
another
short
note
from
Marianne
--
still
affectionate
,
*NL*
open
,
artless
,
confiding
--
everything
that
could
make
MY
conduct
most
*NL*
hateful
.
I
could
not
answer
it
.
I
tried
--
but
could
not
frame
a
*NL*
sentence
.
But
I
thought
of
her
,
I
believe
,
every
moment
of
the
day
.
*NL*
If
you
CAN
pity
me
,
Miss
Dashwood
,
pity
my
situation
as
it
was
THEN
.
*NL*
With
my
head
and
heart
full
of
your
sister
,
I
was
forced
to
play
the
*NL*
happy
lover
to
another
woman
!
--
Those
three
or
four
weeks
were
worse
*NL*
than
all
.
Well
,
at
last
,
as
I
need
not
tell
you
,
you
were
forced
on
*NL*
me
;
and
what
a
sweet
figure
I
cut
!
--
what
an
evening
of
agony
it
was
!
--
*NL*
Marianne
,
beautiful
as
an
angel
on
one
side
,
calling
me
Willoughby
in
*NL*
such
a
tone
!
--
Oh
,
God
!
--
holding
out
her
hand
to
me
,
asking
me
for
an
*NL*
explanation
,
with
those
bewitching
eyes
fixed
in
such
speaking
*NL*
solicitude
on
my
face
!
--
and
Sophia
,
jealous
as
the
devil
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
looking
all
that
was
--
Well
,
it
does
not
signify
;
it
is
over
*NL*
now
.
--
Such
an
evening
!
--
I
ran
away
from
you
all
as
soon
as
I
could
;
*NL*
but
not
before
I
had
seen
Marianne
's
sweet
face
as
white
as
*NL*
death
.
--
THAT
was
the
last
,
last
look
I
ever
had
of
her
;
--
the
last
*NL*
manner
in
which
she
appeared
to
me
.
It
was
a
horrid
sight
!
--
yet
when
I
*NL*
thought
of
her
to-day
as
really
dying
,
it
was
a
kind
of
comfort
to
me
*NL*
to
imagine
that
I
knew
exactly
how
she
would
appear
to
those
,
who
saw
*NL*
her
last
in
this
world
.
She
was
before
me
,
constantly
before
me
,
as
I
*NL*
travelled
,
in
the
same
look
and
hue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
pause
of
mutual
thoughtfulness
succeeded
.
Willoughby
first
*NL*
rousing
himself
,
broke
it
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
me
make
haste
and
be
gone
.
Your
sister
is
certainly
better
,
*NL*
certainly
out
of
danger
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
assured
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
poor
mother
,
too
!
--
doting
on
Marianne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
letter
,
Mr.
Willoughby
,
your
own
letter
;
have
you
any
thing
to
*NL*
say
about
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
THAT
in
particular
.
Your
sister
wrote
to
me
again
,
you
*NL*
know
,
the
very
next
morning
.
You
saw
what
she
said
.
I
was
*NL*
breakfasting
at
the
Ellisons
,
--
and
her
letter
,
with
some
others
,
was
*NL*
brought
to
me
there
from
my
lodgings
.
It
happened
to
catch
Sophia
's
*NL*
eye
before
it
caught
mine
--
and
its
size
,
the
elegance
of
the
paper
,
the
*NL*
hand-writing
altogether
,
immediately
gave
her
a
suspicion
.
Some
vague
*NL*
report
had
reached
her
before
of
my
attachment
to
some
young
lady
in
*NL*
Devonshire
,
and
what
had
passed
within
her
observation
the
preceding
*NL*
evening
had
marked
who
the
young
lady
was
,
and
made
her
more
jealous
*NL*
than
ever
.
Affecting
that
air
of
playfulness
,
therefore
,
which
is
*NL*
delightful
in
a
woman
one
loves
,
she
opened
the
letter
directly
,
*NL*
and
read
its
contents
.
She
was
well
paid
for
her
impudence
.
*NL*
She
read
what
made
her
wretched
.
Her
wretchedness
I
could
have
*NL*
borne
,
but
her
passion
--
her
malice
--
At
all
events
it
must
be
appeased
.
*NL*
And
,
in
short
--
what
do
you
think
of
my
wife
's
style
of
*NL*
letter-writing
?
--
delicate
--
tender
--
truly
feminine
--
was
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
wife
!
--
The
letter
was
in
your
own
hand-writing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
had
only
the
credit
of
servilely
copying
such
sentences
as
*NL*
I
was
ashamed
to
put
my
name
to
.
The
original
was
all
her
own
--
her
own
*NL*
happy
thoughts
and
gentle
diction
.
But
what
could
I
do
!
--
we
were
*NL*
engaged
,
every
thing
in
preparation
,
the
day
almost
fixed
--
But
I
am
*NL*
talking
like
a
fool
.
Preparation
!
--
day
!
--
In
honest
words
,
her
money
*NL*
was
necessary
to
me
,
and
in
a
situation
like
mine
,
any
thing
was
to
be
*NL*
done
to
prevent
a
rupture
.
And
after
all
,
what
did
it
signify
to
my
*NL*
character
in
the
opinion
of
Marianne
and
her
friends
,
in
what
language
*NL*
my
answer
was
couched
?
--
It
must
have
been
only
to
one
end
.
My
business
*NL*
was
to
declare
myself
a
scoundrel
,
and
whether
I
did
it
with
a
bow
or
a
*NL*
bluster
was
of
little
importance
.
--
'
I
am
ruined
for
ever
in
their
*NL*
opinion
--
'
said
I
to
myself
--
'
I
am
shut
out
for
ever
from
their
*NL*
society
,
they
already
think
me
an
unprincipled
fellow
,
this
letter
will
*NL*
only
make
them
think
me
a
blackguard
one
.
'
Such
were
my
reasonings
,
as
,
*NL*
in
a
sort
of
desperate
carelessness
,
I
copied
my
wife
's
words
,
and
*NL*
parted
with
the
last
relics
of
Marianne
.
Her
three
notes
--
unluckily
*NL*
they
were
all
in
my
pocketbook
,
or
I
should
have
denied
their
*NL*
existence
,
and
hoarded
them
for
ever
--
I
was
forced
to
put
them
up
,
and
*NL*
could
not
even
kiss
them
.
And
the
lock
of
hair
--
that
too
I
had
always
*NL*
carried
about
me
in
the
same
pocket-book
,
which
was
now
searched
by
*NL*
Madam
with
the
most
ingratiating
virulence
,
--
the
dear
lock
--
all
,
every
*NL*
memento
was
torn
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
wrong
,
Mr.
Willoughby
,
very
blamable
,
''
said
Elinor
,
while
*NL*
her
voice
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
betrayed
her
compassionate
emotion
;
*NL*
``
you
ought
not
to
speak
in
this
way
,
either
of
Mrs.
Willoughby
or
my
*NL*
sister
.
You
had
made
your
own
choice
.
It
was
not
forced
on
you
.
Your
*NL*
wife
has
a
claim
to
your
politeness
,
to
your
respect
,
at
least
.
She
*NL*
must
be
attached
to
you
,
or
she
would
not
have
married
you
.
To
treat
*NL*
her
with
unkindness
,
to
speak
of
her
slightingly
is
no
atonement
to
*NL*
Marianne
--
nor
can
I
suppose
it
a
relief
to
your
own
conscience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
talk
to
me
of
my
wife
,
''
said
he
with
a
heavy
sigh
.
--
``
She
does
*NL*
not
deserve
your
compassion
.
--
She
knew
I
had
no
regard
for
her
when
we
*NL*
married
.
--
Well
,
married
we
were
,
and
came
down
to
Combe
Magna
to
be
*NL*
happy
,
and
afterwards
returned
to
town
to
be
gay
.
--
And
now
do
you
pity
*NL*
me
,
Miss
Dashwood
?
--
or
have
I
said
all
this
to
no
purpose
?
--
Am
I

be
*NL*
it
only
one
degree
--
am
I
less
guilty
in
your
opinion
than
I
was
*NL*
before
?
--
My
intentions
were
not
always
wrong
.
Have
I
explained
away
*NL*
any
part
of
my
guilt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
have
certainly
removed
something
--
a
little
.
--
You
have
proved
*NL*
yourself
,
on
the
whole
,
less
faulty
than
I
had
believed
you
.
You
have
*NL*
proved
your
heart
less
wicked
,
much
less
wicked
.
But
I
hardly
*NL*
know
--
the
misery
that
you
have
inflicted
--
I
hardly
know
what
could
have
*NL*
made
it
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
repeat
to
your
sister
when
she
is
recovered
,
what
I
have
been
*NL*
telling
you
?
--
Let
me
be
a
little
lightened
too
in
her
opinion
as
well
*NL*
as
in
yours
.
You
tell
me
that
she
has
forgiven
me
already

Let
me
be
*NL*
able
to
fancy
that
a
better
knowledge
of
my
heart

and
of
my
present

will
draw
from
her
a
more
spontaneous

more
natural

more

dignified

forgiveness

Tell
her
of
my
misery

my
*NL*
penitence

tell
her
that
my
heart
was
never
inconstant
to
her

you
will
,
that
at
this

she
is
dearer

ever

``
I
will
tell
her
all
that
is
necessary

you
have
not
explained
to

the

particular
reason
of
your
coming

how
you
heard
of
her
illness

*NL*
``
Last
night
,
in
Drury
Lane
lobby
,
I
ran
against
Sir
John
Middleton
,
and
*NL*
when
he
saw
who
I
was
--
for
the
first
time
these
two
months
--
he
spoke
to
*NL*
me
.
--
That
he
had
cut
me
ever
since
my
marriage
,
I
had
seen
without
*NL*
surprise
or
resentment
.
Now
,
however
,
his
good-natured
,
honest
,
stupid
*NL*
soul
,
full
of
indignation
against
me
,
and
concern
for
your
sister
,
*NL*
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
telling
me
what
he
knew
ought
*NL*
to
--
though
probably
he
did
not
think
it
WOULD
--
vex
me
horridly
.
As
*NL*
bluntly
as
he
could
speak
it
,
therefore
,
he
told
me
that
Marianne
*NL*
Dashwood
was
dying
of
a
putrid
fever
at
Cleveland
--
a
letter
that
*NL*
morning
received
from
Mrs.
Jennings
declared
her
danger
most
*NL*
imminent
--
the
Palmers
are
all
gone
off
in
a
fright
,
&
c.
--
I
was
too
much
*NL*
shocked
to
be
able
to
pass
myself
off
as
insensible
even
to
the
*NL*
undiscerning
Sir
John
.
His
heart
was
softened
in
seeing
mine
suffer
;
*NL*
and
so
much
of
his
ill-will
was
done
away
,
that
when
we
parted
,
he
*NL*
almost
shook
me
by
the
hand
while
he
reminded
me
of
an
old
promise
*NL*
about
a
pointer
puppy
.
What
I
felt
on
hearing
that
your
sister
was
*NL*
dying
--
and
dying
too
,
believing
me
the
greatest
villain
upon
earth
,
*NL*
scorning
,
hating
me
in
her
latest
moments
--
for
how
could
I
tell
what
*NL*
horrid
projects
might
not
have
been
imputed
?
ONE
person
I
was
sure
*NL*
would
represent
me
as
capable
of
any
thing
--
What
I
felt
was
*NL*
dreadful
!
--
My
resolution
was
soon
made
,
and
at
eight
o'clock
this
*NL*
morning
I
was
in
my
carriage
.
Now
you
know
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
made
no
answer
.
Her
thoughts
were
silently
fixed
on
the
*NL*
irreparable
injury
which
too
early
an
independence
and
its
consequent
*NL*
habits
of
idleness
,
dissipation
,
and
luxury
,
had
made
in
the
mind
,
the
*NL*
character
,
the
happiness
,
of
a
man
who
,
to
every
advantage
of
person
*NL*
and
talents
,
united
a
disposition
naturally
open
and
honest
,
and
a
*NL*
feeling
,
affectionate
temper
.
The
world
had
made
him
extravagant
and
*NL*
vain
--
Extravagance
and
vanity
had
made
him
cold-hearted
and
selfish
.
*NL*
Vanity
,
while
seeking
its
own
guilty
triumph
at
the
expense
of
another
,
*NL*
had
involved
him
in
a
real
attachment
,
which
extravagance
,
or
at
least
*NL*
its
offspring
,
necessity
,
had
required
to
be
sacrificed
.
Each
faulty
*NL*
propensity
in
leading
him
to
evil
,
had
led
him
likewise
to
punishment
.
*NL*
The
attachment
,
from
which
against
honour
,
against
feeling
,
against
*NL*
every
better
interest
he
had
outwardly
torn
himself
,
now
,
when
no
*NL*
longer
allowable
,
governed
every
thought
;
and
the
connection
,
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
which
he
had
,
with
little
scruple
,
left
her
sister
to
misery
,
*NL*
was
likely
to
prove
a
source
of
unhappiness
to
himself
of
a
far
more
*NL*
incurable
nature
.
From
a
reverie
of
this
kind
she
was
recalled
at
the
*NL*
end
of
some
minutes
by
Willoughby
,
who
,
rousing
himself
from
a
reverie
*NL*
at
least
equally
painful
,
started
up
in
preparation
for
going
,
and
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
use
in
staying
here
;
I
must
be
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
back
to
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
to
Combe
Magna
.
I
have
business
there
;
from
thence
to
town
in
a
*NL*
day
or
two
.
Good
bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
out
his
hand
.
She
could
not
refuse
to
give
him
hers
;
--
he
*NL*
pressed
it
with
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
DO
think
something
better
of
me
than
you
did
?
''
--
said
he
,
*NL*
letting
it
fall
,
and
leaning
against
the
mantel-piece
as
if
forgetting
*NL*
he
was
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
assured
him
that
she
did
;
--
that
she
forgave
,
pitied
,
wished
him
*NL*
well
--
was
even
interested
in
his
happiness
--
and
added
some
gentle
*NL*
counsel
as
to
the
behaviour
most
likely
to
promote
it
.
His
answer
was
*NL*
not
very
encouraging
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
that
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
must
rub
through
the
world
as
well
as
I
can
.
*NL*
Domestic
happiness
is
out
of
the
question
.
If
,
however
,
I
am
allowed
*NL*
to
think
that
you
and
yours
feel
an
interest
in
my
fate
and
actions
,
it
*NL*
may
be
the
means
--
it
may
put
me
on
my
guard
--
at
least
,
it
may
be
*NL*
something
to
live
for
.
Marianne
to
be
sure
is
lost
to
me
for
ever
.
*NL*
Were
I
even
by
any
blessed
chance
at
liberty
again
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
stopped
him
with
a
reproof
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
--
he
replied
--
``
once
more
good
bye
.
I
shall
now
go
away
and
live
*NL*
in
dread
of
one
event
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sister
's
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
wrong
.
She
can
never
be
more
lost
to
you
than
she
is
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
will
be
gained
by
some
one
else
.
And
if
that
some
one
should
*NL*
be
the
very
he
whom
,
of
all
others
,
I
could
least
bear
--
but
I
will
not
*NL*
stay
to
rob
myself
of
all
your
compassionate
goodwill
,
by
shewing
that
*NL*
where
I
have
most
injured
I
can
least
forgive
.
Good
bye
,
--
God
bless
*NL*
you

*NL*
*NL*
And
with
these
words
,
he
almost
ran
out
of
the
room

CHAPTER
45
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
for
some
time
after
he
left
her
,
for
some
time
even
after
the
*NL*
sound
of
his
carriage
had
died
away
,
remained
too
much
oppressed
by
a
*NL*
crowd
of
ideas
,
widely
differing
in
themselves
,
but
of
which
sadness
*NL*
was
the
general
result
,
to
think
even
of
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Willoughby
,
he
,
whom
only
half
an
hour
ago
she
had
abhorred
as
the
most
*NL*
worthless
of
men
,
Willoughby
,
in
spite
of
all
his
faults
,
excited
a
*NL*
degree
of
commiseration
for
the
sufferings
produced
by
them
,
which
made
*NL*
her
think
of
him
as
now
separated
for
ever
from
her
family
,
with
a
*NL*
tenderness
,
a
regret
,
rather
in
proportion
,
as
she
soon
acknowledged
*NL*
within
herself
--
to
his
wishes
than
to
his
merits
.
She
felt
that
his
*NL*
influence
over
her
mind
was
heightened
by
circumstances
which
ought
not
*NL*
in
reason
to
have
weight
;
by
that
person
of
uncommon
attraction
,
that
*NL*
open
,
affectionate
,
and
lively
manner
which
it
was
no
merit
to
possess
;
*NL*
and
by
that
still
ardent
love
for
Marianne
,
which
it
was
not
even
*NL*
innocent
to
indulge
.
But
she
felt
that
it
was
so
,
long
,
long
before
*NL*
she
could
feel
his
influence
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
at
last
she
returned
to
the
unconscious
Marianne
,
she
found
her
*NL*
just
awaking
,
refreshed
by
so
long
and
sweet
a
sleep
to
the
extent
of
*NL*
her
hopes
.
Elinor
's
heart
was
full
.
The
past
,
the
present
,
the
*NL*
future
,
Willoughby
's
visit
,
Marianne
's
safety
,
and
her
mother
's
*NL*
expected
arrival
,
threw
her
altogether
into
an
agitation
of
spirits
*NL*
which
kept
off
every
indication
of
fatigue
,
and
made
her
only
fearful
*NL*
of
betraying
herself
to
her
sister
.
Short
was
the
time
,
however
,
in
*NL*
which
that
fear
could
affect
her
,
for
within
half
an
hour
after
*NL*
Willoughby
's
leaving
the
house
,
she
was
again
called
down
stairs
by
the
*NL*
sound
of
another
carriage
.
--
Eager
to
save
her
mother
from
every
*NL*
unnecessary
moment
's
horrible
suspense
,
she
ran
immediately
into
the
*NL*
hall
,
and
reached
the
outward
door
just
in
time
to
receive
and
support
*NL*
her
as
she
entered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
whose
terror
as
they
drew
near
the
house
had
produced
*NL*
almost
the
conviction
of
Marianne
's
being
no
more
,
had
no
voice
to
*NL*
inquire
after
her
,
no
voice
even
for
Elinor
;
but
SHE
,
waiting
neither
*NL*
for
salutation
nor
inquiry
,
instantly
gave
the
joyful
relief
;
--
and
her
*NL*
mother
,
catching
it
with
all
her
usual
warmth
,
was
in
a
moment
as
much
*NL*
overcome
by
her
happiness
,
as
she
had
been
before
by
her
fears
.
She
*NL*
was
supported
into
the
drawing-room
between
her
daughter
and
her
*NL*
friend
;
--
and
there
,
shedding
tears
of
joy
,
though
still
unable
to
*NL*
speak
,
embraced
Elinor
again
and
again
,
turning
from
her
at
intervals
*NL*
to
press
Colonel
Brandon
's
hand
,
with
a
look
which
spoke
at
once
her
*NL*
gratitude
,
and
her
conviction
of
his
sharing
with
herself
in
the
bliss
*NL*
of
the
moment
.
He
shared
it
,
however
,
in
a
silence
even
greater
than
*NL*
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Mrs.
Dashwood
had
recovered
herself
,
to
see
Marianne
was
her
*NL*
first
desire
;
and
in
two
minutes
she
was
with
her
beloved
child
,
*NL*
rendered
dearer
to
her
than
ever
by
absence
,
unhappiness
,
and
danger
.
*NL*
Elinor
's
delight
,
as
she
saw
what
each
felt
in
the
meeting
,
was
only
*NL*
checked
by
an
apprehension
of
its
robbing
Marianne
of
farther
*NL*
sleep
;
--
but
Mrs.
Dashwood
could
be
calm
,
could
be
even
prudent
,
when
*NL*
the
life
of
a
child
was
at
stake
,
and
Marianne
,
satisfied
in
knowing
*NL*
her
mother
was
near
her
,
and
conscious
of
being
too
weak
for
*NL*
conversation
,
submitted
readily
to
the
silence
and
quiet
prescribed
by
*NL*
every
nurse
around
her
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
WOULD
sit
up
with
her
all
night
;
*NL*
and
Elinor
,
in
compliance
with
her
mother
's
entreaty
,
went
to
bed
.
But
*NL*
the
rest
,
which
one
night
entirely
sleepless
,
and
many
hours
of
the
*NL*
most
wearing
anxiety
seemed
to
make
requisite
,
was
kept
off
by
*NL*
irritation
of
spirits
.
Willoughby
,
``
poor
Willoughby
,
''
as
she
now
*NL*
allowed
herself
to
call
him
,
was
constantly
in
her
thoughts
;
she
would
*NL*
not
but
have
heard
his
vindication
for
the
world
,
and
now
blamed
,
now
*NL*
acquitted
herself
for
having
judged
him
so
harshly
before
.
But
her
*NL*
promise
of
relating
it
to
her
sister
was
invariably
painful
.
She
*NL*
dreaded
the
performance
of
it
,
dreaded
what
its
effect
on
Marianne
*NL*
might
be
;
doubted
whether
after
such
an
explanation
she
could
ever
be
*NL*
happy
with
another
;
and
for
a
moment
wished
Willoughby
a
widower
.
*NL*
Then
,
remembering
Colonel
Brandon
,
reproved
herself
,
felt
that
to
HIS
*NL*
sufferings
and
his
constancy
far
more
than
to
his
rival
's
,
the
reward
*NL*
of
her
sister
was
due
,
and
wished
any
thing
rather
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Willoughby
's
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shock
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
errand
at
Barton
had
been
much
softened
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Dashwood
by
her
own
previous
alarm
;
for
so
great
was
her
*NL*
uneasiness
about
Marianne
,
that
she
had
already
determined
to
set
out
*NL*
for
Cleveland
on
that
very
day
,
without
waiting
for
any
further
*NL*
intelligence
,
and
had
so
far
settled
her
journey
before
his
arrival
,
*NL*
that
the
Careys
were
then
expected
every
moment
to
fetch
Margaret
away
,
*NL*
as
her
mother
was
unwilling
to
take
her
where
there
might
be
infection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
continued
to
mend
every
day
,
and
the
brilliant
cheerfulness
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
looks
and
spirits
proved
her
to
be
,
as
she
repeatedly
*NL*
declared
herself
,
one
of
the
happiest
women
in
the
world
.
Elinor
could
*NL*
not
hear
the
declaration
,
nor
witness
its
proofs
without
sometimes
*NL*
wondering
whether
her
mother
ever
recollected
Edward
.
But
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashwood
,
trusting
to
the
temperate
account
of
her
own
disappointment
*NL*
which
Elinor
had
sent
her
,
was
led
away
by
the
exuberance
of
her
joy
to
*NL*
think
only
of
what
would
increase
it
.
Marianne
was
restored
to
her
*NL*
from
a
danger
in
which
,
as
she
now
began
to
feel
,
her
own
mistaken
*NL*
judgment
in
encouraging
the
unfortunate
attachment
to
Willoughby
,
had
*NL*
contributed
to
place
her
;
--
and
in
her
recovery
she
had
yet
another
*NL*
source
of
joy
unthought
of
by
Elinor
.
It
was
thus
imparted
to
her
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
any
opportunity
of
private
conference
between
them
occurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
we
are
alone
.
My
Elinor
,
you
do
not
yet
know
all
my
*NL*
happiness
.
Colonel
Brandon
loves
Marianne
.
He
has
told
me
so
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
daughter
,
feeling
by
turns
both
pleased
and
pained
,
surprised
and
*NL*
not
surprised
,
was
all
silent
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
never
like
me
,
dear
Elinor
,
or
I
should
wonder
at
your
*NL*
composure
now
.
Had
I
sat
down
to
wish
for
any
possible
good
to
my
*NL*
family
,
I
should
have
fixed
on
Colonel
Brandon
's
marrying
one
of
you
as
*NL*
the
object
most
desirable
.
And
I
believe
Marianne
will
be
the
most
*NL*
happy
with
him
of
the
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
was
half
inclined
to
ask
her
reason
for
thinking
so
,
because
*NL*
satisfied
that
none
founded
on
an
impartial
consideration
of
their
age
,
*NL*
characters
,
or
feelings
,
could
be
given
;
--
but
her
mother
must
always
be
*NL*
carried
away
by
her
imagination
on
any
interesting
subject
,
and
*NL*
therefore
instead
of
an
inquiry
,
she
passed
it
off
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
opened
his
whole
heart
to
me
yesterday
as
we
travelled
.
It
came
*NL*
out
quite
unawares
,
quite
undesignedly
.
I
,
you
may
well
believe
,
could
*NL*
talk
of
nothing
but
my
child
;
--
he
could
not
conceal
his
distress
;
I
saw
*NL*
that
it
equalled
my
own
,
and
he
perhaps
,
thinking
that
mere
friendship
,
*NL*
as
the
world
now
goes
,
would
not
justify
so
warm
a
sympathy
--
or
rather
,
*NL*
not
thinking
at
all
,
I
suppose
--
giving
way
to
irresistible
feelings
,
*NL*
made
me
acquainted
with
his
earnest
,
tender
,
constant
,
affection
for
*NL*
Marianne
.
He
has
loved
her
,
my
Elinor
,
ever
since
the
first
moment
of
*NL*
seeing
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
however
,
Elinor
perceived
,
--
not
the
language
,
not
the
professions
*NL*
of
Colonel
Brandon
,
but
the
natural
embellishments
of
her
mother
's
*NL*
active
fancy
,
which
fashioned
every
thing
delightful
to
her
as
it
chose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
regard
for
her
,
infinitely
surpassing
anything
that
Willoughby
*NL*
ever
felt
or
feigned
,
as
much
more
warm
,
as
more
sincere
or
*NL*
constant
--
which
ever
we
are
to
call
it
--
has
subsisted
through
all
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
dear
Marianne
's
unhappy
prepossession
for
that
worthless
*NL*
young
man
!
--
and
without
selfishness
--
without
encouraging
a
hope
!
--
could
*NL*
he
have
seen
her
happy
with
another
--
Such
a
noble
mind
!

such
openness
,
*NL*
such
sincerity
!

no
one
can
be
deceived
in
HIM

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
Brandon
's
character

''
said
Elinor
,
``
as
an
excellent
man
,
is
*NL*
well
established

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

replied
her

seriously
,
``

*NL*
I
should
be
the

to

pleased

by
it
.
But
his
coming
for
me
as
he
did
,
with
such
active
,
such
ready
*NL*
friendship
,
is
enough
to
prove
him
one
of
the
worthiest
of
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
character

however

''
answered
Elinor
,
``
does
not
rest
on
ONE
act
of

kindness
,
to
which
his
affection
for
Marianne
,
were
humanity
out
of
the
*NL*
case
,
would
have
prompted
him
.
To
Mrs.
Jennings
,
to
the
Middletons
,
he
*NL*
has
been
long
and
intimately
known
;
they
equally
love
and
respect
him
;
*NL*
and
even
my
own
knowledge
of
him
,
though
lately
acquired
,
is
very
*NL*
considerable
;

so
highly
do
I
value
and
esteem
him
,
that
if
Marianne
*NL*
can
be
happy
with
him
,
I
shall
be
as
ready
as
yourself
to
think
our
*NL*
connection
the
greatest
blessing
to
us
in
the
world
.
What
answer
did
*NL*
you
give
him
?

Did
you
allow
him
to
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
my
love
,
I
could
not
then
talk
of
hope
to
him
or
to
myself
.
*NL*
Marianne
might
at
that
moment
be
dying
.
But
he
did
not
ask
for
hope
or
*NL*
encouragement
.
His
was
an
involuntary
confidence
,
an
irrepressible
*NL*
effusion
to
a
soothing
friend
--
not
an
application
to
a
parent
.
Yet
*NL*
after
a
time
I
DID
say
,
for
at
first
I
was
quite
overcome
--
that
if
she
*NL*
lived
,
as
I
trusted
she
might
,
my
greatest
happiness
would
lie
in
*NL*
promoting
their
marriage
;

since
our
arrival
,
since
our
delightful
*NL*
security
,
I
have
repeated
it
to
him
more
fully
,
have
given
him
every
*NL*
encouragement
in
my
power

Time
,
a
very
little
time
,
I
tell
him
,
will
*NL*
do
everything
;

Marianne
's
heart
is
not
to
be
wasted
for
ever
on
such
a
*NL*
man
as
Willoughby
.
--
His
own
merits
must
soon
secure
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
judge
from
the
Colonel
's
spirits
,
however
,
you
have
not
yet
made
*NL*
him
equally
sanguine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

He
thinks
Marianne
's
affection
too
deeply
rooted
for
any
change
*NL*
in
it
under
a
great
length
of
time
,
and
even
supposing
her
heart
again
*NL*
free
,
is
too
diffident
of
himself
to
believe
,
that
with
such
a
*NL*
difference
of
age
and
disposition
he
could
ever
attach
her
.
There
,
*NL*
however
,
he
is
quite
mistaken
.
His
age
is
only
so
much
beyond
hers
as
*NL*
to
be
an
advantage
,
as
to
make
his
character
and
principles
fixed
;

*NL*
his
disposition
,
I
am
well
convinced
,
is
exactly
the
very
one
to
make
*NL*
your
sister
happy
.
And
his
person
,
his
manners
too
,
are
all
in
his
*NL*
favour
.
My
partiality
does
not
blind
me
;
he
certainly
is
not
so
*NL*
handsome
as
Willoughby
--
but
at
the
same
time
,
there
is
something
much
*NL*
more
pleasing
in
his
countenance
.
--
There
was
always
a
something
,
--
if
*NL*
you
remember
,
--
in
Willoughby
's
eyes
at
times
,
which
I
did
not
like
.

*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
NOT
remember
it
;

but
her
mother
,
without
waiting
for
her
*NL*
assent
,
continued
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
his
manners
,
the
Colonel
's
manners
are
not
only
more
pleasing
to
*NL*
me
than
Willoughby
's
ever
were
,
but
they
are
of
a
kind
I
well
know
to
*NL*
be
more
solidly
attaching
to
Marianne
.
Their
gentleness
,
their
genuine
*NL*
attention
to
other
people
,
and
their
manly
unstudied
simplicity
is
much
*NL*
more
accordant
with
her
real
disposition
,
than
the
liveliness
--
often
*NL*
artificial
,
and
often
ill-timed
of
the
other
.
I
am
very
sure
myself
,
*NL*
that
had
Willoughby
turned
out
as
really
amiable
,
as
he
has
proved
*NL*
himself
the
contrary

Marianne
would
yet
never
have
been
so
happy
with
*NL*
HIM

she
will

with
Colonel

paused

Her
daughter
could
not
quite
agree
with
her

her

dissent
was
not
heard

therefore
gave
no
offence

``
even
if

indeed
there
certainly
MUST
be
some
small

close

here
was
a

stubborn

Here
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
third

Elinor
withdrew
to
think
it
all
over
in
private
,
to
wish
success
to
her

in
wishing

CHAPTER
46
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
's
illness
,
though
weakening
in
its
kind
,
had
not
been
long
*NL*
enough
to
make
her
recovery
slow
;
and
with
youth
,
natural
strength
,
and
*NL*
her
mother
's
presence
in
aid
,
it
proceeded
so
smoothly
as
to
enable
her
*NL*
to
remove
,
within
four
days
after
the
arrival
of
the
latter
,
into
Mrs.
*NL*
Palmer
's
dressing-room
.
When
there
,
at
her
own
particular
request
,
for
*NL*
she
was
impatient
to
pour
forth
her
thanks
to
him
for
fetching
her
*NL*
mother
,
Colonel
Brandon
was
invited
to
visit
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
emotion
on
entering
the
room
,
in
seeing
her
altered
looks
,
and
in
*NL*
receiving
the
pale
hand
which
she
immediately
held
out
to
him
,
was
*NL*
such
,
as
,
in
Elinor
's
conjecture
,
must
arise
from
something
more
than
*NL*
his
affection
for
Marianne
,
or
the
consciousness
of
its
being
known
to
*NL*
others
;
and
she
soon
discovered
in
his
melancholy
eye
and
varying
*NL*
complexion
as
he
looked
at
her
sister
,
the
probable
recurrence
of
many
*NL*
past
scenes
of
misery
to
his
mind
,
brought
back
by
that
resemblance
*NL*
between
Marianne
and
Eliza
already
acknowledged
,
and
now
strengthened
*NL*
by
the
hollow
eye
,
the
sickly
skin
,
the
posture
of
reclining
weakness
,
*NL*
and
the
warm
acknowledgment
of
peculiar
obligation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
not
less
watchful
of
what
passed
than
her
daughter
,
but
*NL*
with
a
mind
very
differently
influenced
,
and
therefore
watching
to
very
*NL*
different
effect
,
saw
nothing
in
the
Colonel
's
behaviour
but
what
arose
*NL*
from
the
most
simple
and
self-evident
sensations
,
while
in
the
actions
*NL*
and
words
of
Marianne
she
persuaded
herself
to
think
that
something
*NL*
more
than
gratitude
already
dawned
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
another
day
or
two
,
Marianne
growing
visibly
stronger
*NL*
every
twelve
hours
,
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
urged
equally
by
her
own
and
her
*NL*
daughter
's
wishes
,
began
to
talk
of
removing
to
Barton
.
On
HER
*NL*
measures
depended
those
of
her
two
friends
;
Mrs.
Jennings
could
not
*NL*
quit
Cleveland
during
the
Dashwoods
'
stay
;
and
Colonel
Brandon
was
soon
*NL*
brought
,
by
their
united
request
,
to
consider
his
own
abode
there
as
*NL*
equally
determinate
,
if
not
equally
indispensable
.
At
his
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
's
united
request
in
return
,
Mrs.
Dashwood
was
prevailed
on
to
*NL*
accept
the
use
of
his
carriage
on
her
journey
back
,
for
the
better
*NL*
accommodation
of
her
sick
child
;
and
the
Colonel
,
at
the
joint
*NL*
invitation
of
Mrs.
Dashwood
and
Mrs.
Jennings
,
whose
active
good-nature
*NL*
made
her
friendly
and
hospitable
for
other
people
as
well
as
herself
,
*NL*
engaged
with
pleasure
to
redeem
it
by
a
visit
at
the
cottage
,
in
the
*NL*
course
of
a
few
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
of
separation
and
departure
arrived
;
and
Marianne
,
after
taking
*NL*
so
particular
and
lengthened
a
leave
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
one
so
earnestly
*NL*
grateful
,
so
full
of
respect
and
kind
wishes
as
seemed
due
to
her
own
*NL*
heart
from
a
secret
acknowledgment
of
past
inattention
,
and
bidding
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
farewell
with
a
cordiality
of
a
friend
,
was
carefully
*NL*
assisted
by
him
into
the
carriage
,
of
which
he
seemed
anxious
that
she
*NL*
should
engross
at
least
half
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
and
Elinor
then
followed
,
*NL*
and
the
others
were
left
by
themselves
,
to
talk
of
the
travellers
,
and
*NL*
feel
their
own
dullness
,
till
Mrs.
Jennings
was
summoned
to
her
chaise
*NL*
to
take
comfort
in
the
gossip
of
her
maid
for
the
loss
of
her
two
young
*NL*
companions
;
and
Colonel
Brandon
immediately
afterwards
took
his
*NL*
solitary
way
to
Delaford
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dashwoods
were
two
days
on
the
road
,
and
Marianne
bore
her
journey
*NL*
on
both
,
without
essential
fatigue
.
Every
thing
that
the
most
zealous
*NL*
affection
,
the
most
solicitous
care
could
do
to
render
her
comfortable
,
*NL*
was
the
office
of
each
watchful
companion
,
and
each
found
their
reward
*NL*
in
her
bodily
ease
,
and
her
calmness
of
spirits
.
To
Elinor
,
the
*NL*
observation
of
the
latter
was
particularly
grateful
.
She
,
who
had
seen
*NL*
her
week
after
week
so
constantly
suffering
,
oppressed
by
anguish
of
*NL*
heart
which
she
had
neither
courage
to
speak
of
,
nor
fortitude
to
*NL*
conceal
,
now
saw
with
a
joy
,
which
no
other
could
equally
share
,
an
*NL*
apparent
composure
of
mind
,
which
,
in
being
the
result
as
she
trusted
*NL*
of
serious
reflection
,
must
eventually
lead
her
to
contentment
and
*NL*
cheerfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
approached
Barton
,
indeed
,
and
entered
on
scenes
of
which
every
*NL*
field
and
every
tree
brought
some
peculiar
,
some
painful
recollection
,
*NL*
she
grew
silent
and
thoughtful
,
and
turning
away
her
face
from
their
*NL*
notice
,
sat
earnestly
gazing
through
the
window
.
But
here
,
Elinor
*NL*
could
neither
wonder
nor
blame
;
and
when
she
saw
,
as
she
assisted
*NL*
Marianne
from
the
carriage
,
that
she
had
been
crying
,
she
saw
only
an
*NL*
emotion
too
natural
in
itself
to
raise
any
thing
less
tender
than
pity
,
*NL*
and
in
its
unobtrusiveness
entitled
to
praise
.
In
the
whole
of
her
*NL*
subsequent
manner
,
she
traced
the
direction
of
a
mind
awakened
to
*NL*
reasonable
exertion
;
for
no
sooner
had
they
entered
their
common
*NL*
sitting-room
,
than
Marianne
turned
her
eyes
around
it
with
a
look
of
*NL*
resolute
firmness
,
as
if
determined
at
once
to
accustom
herself
to
the
*NL*
sight
of
every
object
with
which
the
remembrance
of
Willoughby
could
be
*NL*
connected
.
--
She
said
little
,
but
every
sentence
aimed
at
cheerfulness
,
*NL*
and
though
a
sigh
sometimes
escaped
her
,
it
never
passed
away
without
*NL*
the
atonement
of
a
smile
.
After
dinner
she
would
try
her
piano-forte
.
*NL*
She
went
to
it
;
but
the
music
on
which
her
eye
first
rested
was
an
*NL*
opera
,
procured
for
her
by
Willoughby
,
containing
some
of
their
*NL*
favourite
duets
,
and
bearing
on
its
outward
leaf
her
own
name
in
his
*NL*
hand-writing
.
--
That
would
not
do
.
--
She
shook
her
head
,
put
the
music
*NL*
aside
,
and
after
running
over
the
keys
for
a
minute
,
complained
of
*NL*
feebleness
in
her
fingers
,
and
closed
the
instrument
again
;
declaring
*NL*
however
with
firmness
as
she
did
so
,
that
she
should
in
future
practice
*NL*
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
produced
no
abatement
in
these
happy
symptoms
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
with
a
mind
and
body
alike
strengthened
by
rest
,
she
looked
*NL*
and
spoke
with
more
genuine
spirit
,
anticipating
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
Margaret
's
return
,
and
talking
of
the
dear
family
party
which
would
*NL*
then
be
restored
,
of
their
mutual
pursuits
and
cheerful
society
,
as
the
*NL*
only
happiness
worth
a
wish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
weather
is
settled
,
and
I
have
recovered
my
strength
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
``
we
will
take
long
walks
together
every
day
.
We
will
walk
to
the
*NL*
farm
at
the
edge
of
the
down
,
and
see
how
the
children
go
on
;
we
will
*NL*
walk
to
Sir
John
's
new
plantations
at
Barton
Cross
,
and
the
Abbeyland
;
*NL*
and
we
will
often
go
to
the
old
ruins
of
the
Priory
,
and
try
to
trace
its
*NL*
foundations
as
far
as
we
are
told
they
once
reached
.
I
know
we
shall
*NL*
be
happy
.
I
know
the
summer
will
pass
happily
away
.
I
mean
never
to
*NL*
be
later
in
rising
than
six
,
and
from
that
time
till
dinner
I
shall
*NL*
divide
every
moment
between
music
and
reading
.
I
have
formed
my
plan
,
*NL*
and
am
determined
to
enter
on
a
course
of
serious
study
.
Our
own
*NL*
library
is
too
well
known
to
me
,
to
be
resorted
to
for
any
thing
beyond
*NL*
mere
amusement
.
But
there
are
many
works
well
worth
reading
at
the
*NL*
Park
;
and
there
are
others
of
more
modern
production
which
I
know
I
can
*NL*
borrow
of
Colonel
Brandon
.
By
reading
only
six
hours
a-day
,
I
shall
*NL*
gain
in
the
course
of
a
twelve-month
a
great
deal
of
instruction
which
*NL*
I
now
feel
myself
to
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
honoured
her
for
a
plan
which
originated
so
nobly
as
this
;
*NL*
though
smiling
to
see
the
same
eager
fancy
which
had
been
leading
her
*NL*
to
the
extreme
of
languid
indolence
and
selfish
repining
,
now
at
work
*NL*
in
introducing
excess
into
a
scheme
of
such
rational
employment
and
*NL*
virtuous
self-control
.
Her
smile
however
changed
to
a
sigh
when
she
*NL*
remembered
that
promise
to
Willoughby
was
yet
unfulfilled
,
and
feared
*NL*
she
had
that
to
communicate
which
might
again
unsettle
the
mind
of
*NL*
Marianne
,
and
ruin
at
least
for
a
time
this
fair
prospect
of
busy
*NL*
tranquillity
.
Willing
therefore
to
delay
the
evil
hour
,
she
resolved
*NL*
to
wait
till
her
sister
's
health
were
more
secure
,
before
she
appointed
*NL*
it
.
But
the
resolution
was
made
only
to
be
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
had
been
two
or
three
days
at
home
,
before
the
weather
was
*NL*
fine
enough
for
an
invalid
like
herself
to
venture
out
.
But
at
last
a
*NL*
soft
,
genial
morning
appeared
;
such
as
might
tempt
the
daughter
's
*NL*
wishes
and
the
mother
's
confidence
;
and
Marianne
,
leaning
on
Elinor
's
*NL*
arm
,
was
authorised
to
walk
as
long
as
she
could
without
fatigue
,
in
*NL*
the
lane
before
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sisters
set
out
at
a
pace
,
slow
as
the
feebleness
of
Marianne
in
an
*NL*
exercise
hitherto
untried
since
her
illness
required
;
--
and
they
had
*NL*
advanced
only
so
far
beyond
the
house
as
to
admit
a
full
view
of
the
*NL*
hill
,
the
important
hill
behind
,
when
pausing
with
her
eyes
turned
*NL*
towards
it
,
Marianne
calmly
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
exactly
there
,
''
--
pointing
with
one
hand
,
``
on
that
projecting
*NL*
mound
,
--
there
I
fell
;
and
there
I
first
saw
Willoughby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
sunk
with
the
word
,
but
presently
reviving
she
added
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thankful
to
find
that
I
can
look
with
so
little
pain
on
the
*NL*
spot
!
--
shall
we
ever
talk
on
that
subject
,
Elinor
?
''
--
hesitatingly
it
*NL*
was
said
.
--
``
Or
will
it
be
wrong
?
--
I
can
talk
of
it
now
,
I
hope
,
as
I
*NL*
ought
to
do
.
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
tenderly
invited
her
to
be
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
regret
,
''
said
Marianne
,
``
I
have
done
with
that
,
as
far
as
HE
is
*NL*
concerned
.
I
do
not
mean
to
talk
to
you
of
what
my
feelings
have
been
*NL*
for
him
,
but
what
they
are
NOW
.
--
At
present
,
if
I
could
be
satisfied
on
*NL*
one
point
,
if
I
could
be
allowed
to
think
that
he
was
not
ALWAYS
acting
*NL*
a
part
,
not
ALWAYS
deceiving
me
;
--
but
above
all
,
if
I
could
be
assured
*NL*
that
he
never
was
so
VERY
wicked
as
my
fears
have
sometimes
fancied
*NL*
him
,
since
the
story
of
that
unfortunate
girl
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopt
.
Elinor
joyfully
treasured
her
words
as
she
answered
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
could
be
assured
of
that
,
you
think
you
should
be
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
My
peace
of
mind
is
doubly
involved
in
it
;
--
for
not
only
is
it
*NL*
horrible
to
suspect
a
person
,
who
has
been
what
HE
has
been
to
ME
,
of
*NL*
such
designs
,
--
but
what
must
it
make
me
appear
to
myself
?
--
What
in
a
*NL*
situation
like
mine
,
but
a
most
shamefully
unguarded
affection
could
*NL*
expose
me
to
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
then
,
''
asked
her
sister
,
``
would
you
account
for
his
behaviour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
suppose
him
,
--
Oh
,
how
gladly
would
I
suppose
him
,
only
fickle
,
*NL*
very
,
very
fickle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
said
no
more
.
She
was
debating
within
herself
on
the
*NL*
eligibility
of
beginning
her
story
directly
,
or
postponing
it
till
*NL*
Marianne
were
in
stronger
health
;
--
and
they
crept
on
for
a
few
minutes
*NL*
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
wishing
him
too
much
good
,
''
said
Marianne
at
last
with
a
*NL*
sigh
,
``
when
I
wish
his
secret
reflections
may
be
no
more
unpleasant
*NL*
than
my
own
.
He
will
suffer
enough
in
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
compare
your
conduct
with
his
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
compare
it
with
what
it
ought
to
have
been
;
I
compare
it
with
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
situations
have
borne
little
resemblance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
borne
more
than
our
conduct
.
--
Do
not
,
my
dearest
Elinor
,
let
*NL*
your
kindness
defend
what
I
know
your
judgment
must
censure
.
My
*NL*
illness
has
made
me
think
--
It
has
given
me
leisure
and
calmness
for
*NL*
serious
recollection
.
Long
before
I
was
enough
recovered
to
talk
,
I
*NL*
was
perfectly
able
to
reflect
.
I
considered
the
past
:
I
saw
in
my
own
*NL*
behaviour
,
since
the
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
with
him
last
*NL*
autumn
,
nothing
but
a
series
of
imprudence
towards
myself
,
and
want
of
*NL*
kindness
to
others
.
I
saw
that
my
own
feelings
had
prepared
my
*NL*
sufferings
,
and
that
my
want
of
fortitude
under
them
had
almost
led
me
*NL*
to
the
grave
.
My
illness
,
I
well
knew
,
had
been
entirely
brought
on
by
*NL*
myself
by
such
negligence
of
my
own
health
,
as
I
had
felt
even
at
the
*NL*
time
to
be
wrong
.
Had
I
died
,
--
it
would
have
been
self-destruction
.
I
*NL*
did
not
know
my
danger
till
the
danger
was
removed
;
but
with
such
*NL*
feelings
as
these
reflections
gave
me
,
I
wonder
at
my
recovery
,
--
wonder
*NL*
that
the
very
eagerness
of
my
desire
to
live
,
to
have
time
for
*NL*
atonement
to
my
God
,
and
to
you
all
,
did
not
kill
me
at
once
.
Had
I
*NL*
died
,
--
in
what
peculiar
misery
should
I
have
left
you
,
my
nurse
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
my
sister
!
--
You
,
who
had
seen
all
the
fretful
selfishness
of
my
*NL*
latter
days
;
who
had
known
all
the
murmurings
of
my
heart
!
--
How
should
*NL*
I
have
lived
in
YOUR
remembrance
!
--
My
mother
too
!
How
could
you
have
*NL*
consoled
her
!
--
I
can
not
express
my
own
abhorrence
of
myself
.
Whenever
*NL*
I
looked
towards
the
past
,
I
saw
some
duty
neglected
,
or
some
failing
*NL*
indulged
.
Every
body
seemed
injured
by
me
.
The
kindness
,
the
*NL*
unceasing
kindness
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
I
had
repaid
with
ungrateful
*NL*
contempt
.
To
the
Middletons
,
to
the
Palmers
,
the
Steeles
,
to
every
*NL*
common
acquaintance
even
,
I
had
been
insolent
and
unjust
;
with
a
heart
*NL*
hardened
against
their
merits
,
and
a
temper
irritated
by
their
very
*NL*
attention
.
--
To
John
,
to
Fanny
,
--
yes
,
even
to
them
,
little
as
they
*NL*
deserve
,
I
had
given
less
than
their
due
.
But
you
,
--
you
above
all
,
*NL*
above
my
mother
,
had
been
wronged
by
me
.
I
,
and
only
I
,
knew
your
*NL*
heart
and
its
sorrows
;
yet
to
what
did
it
influence
me
?
--
not
to
any
*NL*
compassion
that
could
benefit
you
or
myself
.
--
Your
example
was
before
*NL*
me
;
but
to
what
avail
?
--
Was
I
more
considerate
of
you
and
your
comfort
?
*NL*
Did
I
imitate
your
forbearance
,
or
lessen
your
restraints
,
by
taking
*NL*
any
part
in
those
offices
of
general
complaisance
or
particular
*NL*
gratitude
which
you
had
hitherto
been
left
to
discharge
*NL*
alone
?
--
No
;
--
not
less
when
I
knew
you
to
be
unhappy
,
than
when
I
had
*NL*
believed
you
at
ease
,
did
I
turn
away
from
every
exertion
of
duty
or
*NL*
friendship
;
scarcely
allowing
sorrow
to
exist
but
with
me
,
regretting
*NL*
only
THAT
heart
which
had
deserted
and
wronged
me
,
and
leaving
you
,
for
*NL*
whom
I
professed
an
unbounded
affection
,
to
be
miserable
for
my
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
ceased
the
rapid
flow
of
her
self-reproving
spirit
;
and
Elinor
,
*NL*
impatient
to
soothe
,
though
too
honest
to
flatter
,
gave
her
instantly
*NL*
that
praise
and
support
which
her
frankness
and
her
contrition
so
well
*NL*
deserved
.
Marianne
pressed
her
hand
and
replied
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
good
.
--
The
future
must
be
my
proof
.
I
have
laid
down
my
*NL*
plan
,
and
if
I
am
capable
of
adhering
to
it
--
my
feelings
shall
be
*NL*
governed
and
my
temper
improved
.
They
shall
no
longer
worry
others
,
*NL*
nor
torture
myself
.
I
shall
now
live
solely
for
my
family
.
You
,
my
*NL*
mother
,
and
Margaret
,
must
henceforth
be
all
the
world
to
me
;
you
will
*NL*
share
my
affections
entirely
between
you
.
From
you
,
from
my
home
,
I
*NL*
shall
never
again
have
the
smallest
incitement
to
move
;
and
if
I
do
mix
*NL*
in
other
society
,
it
will
be
only
to
shew
that
my
spirit
is
humbled
,
my
*NL*
heart
amended
,
and
that
I
can
practise
the
civilities
,
the
lesser
*NL*
duties
of
life
,
with
gentleness
and
forbearance
.
As
for
Willoughby

*NL*
say
that
I
shall
soon
or
that
I
shall
ever
forget
him
,
would
be
idle
.
*NL*
His
remembrance
can
be
overcome
by
no
change
of
circumstances
or
*NL*
opinions
.
But
it
shall
be
regulated
,
it
shall
be
checked
by
religion
,
*NL*
by
reason
,
by
constant
employment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
--
and
added
in
a
low
voice
,
``
If
I
could
but
know
HIS
heart
,
*NL*
everything
would
become
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
who
had
now
been
for
some
time
reflecting
on
the
propriety
or
*NL*
impropriety
of
speedily
hazarding
her
narration
,
without
feeling
at
all
*NL*
nearer
decision
than
at
first
,
heard
this
;
and
perceiving
that
as
*NL*
reflection
did
nothing
,
resolution
must
do
all
,
soon
found
herself
*NL*
leading
to
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
managed
the
recital
,
as
she
hoped
,
with
address
;
prepared
her
*NL*
anxious
listener
with
caution
;
related
simply
and
honestly
the
chief
*NL*
points
on
which
Willoughby
grounded
his
apology
;
did
justice
to
his
*NL*
repentance
,
and
softened
only
his
protestations
of
present
regard
.
*NL*
Marianne
said
not
a
word
.
--
She
trembled
,
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
her
lips
became
whiter
than
even
sickness
had
left
them
.
A
*NL*
thousand
inquiries
sprung
up
from
her
heart
,
but
she
dared
not
urge
*NL*
one
.
She
caught
every
syllable
with
panting
eagerness
;
her
hand
,
*NL*
unknowingly
to
herself
,
closely
pressed
her
sister
's
,
and
tears
covered
*NL*
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
dreading
her
being
tired
,
led
her
towards
home
;
and
till
they
*NL*
reached
the
door
of
the
cottage
,
easily
conjecturing
what
her
curiosity
*NL*
must
be
though
no
question
was
suffered
to
speak
it
,
talked
of
nothing
*NL*
but
Willoughby
,
and
their
conversation
together
;
and
was
carefully
*NL*
minute
in
every
particular
of
speech
and
look
,
where
minuteness
could
*NL*
be
safely
indulged
.
As
soon
as
they
entered
the
house
,
Marianne
with
a
*NL*
kiss
of
gratitude
and
these
two
words
just
articulate
through
her
*NL*
tears
,
``
Tell
mama
,
''
withdrew
from
her
sister
and
walked
slowly
up
*NL*
stairs
.
Elinor
would
not
attempt
to
disturb
a
solitude
so
reasonable
*NL*
as
what
she
now
sought
;
and
with
a
mind
anxiously
pre-arranging
its
*NL*
result
,
and
a
resolution
of
reviving
the
subject
again
,
should
Marianne
*NL*
fail
to
do
it
,
she
turned
into
the
parlour
to
fulfill
her
parting
*NL*
injunction
.

CHAPTER
47
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
did
not
hear
unmoved
the
vindication
of
her
former
*NL*
favourite
.
She
rejoiced
in
his
being
cleared
from
some
part
of
his
*NL*
imputed
guilt
;
--
she
was
sorry
for
him
;
--
she
wished
him
happy
.
But
the
*NL*
feelings
of
the
past
could
not
be
recalled
.
--
Nothing
could
restore
him
*NL*
with
a
faith
unbroken
--
a
character
unblemished
,
to
Marianne
.
Nothing
*NL*
could
do
away
the
knowledge
of
what
the
latter
had
suffered
through
his
*NL*
means
,
nor
remove
the
guilt
of
his
conduct
towards
Eliza
.
Nothing
*NL*
could
replace
him
,
therefore
,
in
her
former
esteem
,
nor
injure
the
*NL*
interests
of
Colonel
Brandon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
like
her
daughter
,
heard
Willoughby
's
story
from
*NL*
himself
--
had
she
witnessed
his
distress
,
and
been
under
the
influence
*NL*
of
his
countenance
and
his
manner
,
it
is
probable
that
her
compassion
*NL*
would
have
been
greater
.
But
it
was
neither
in
Elinor
's
power
,
nor
in
*NL*
her
wish
,
to
rouse
such
feelings
in
another
,
by
her
retailed
*NL*
explanation
,
as
had
at
first
been
called
forth
in
herself
.
Reflection
*NL*
had
given
calmness
to
her
judgment
,
and
sobered
her
own
opinion
of
*NL*
Willoughby
's
deserts
;
--
she
wished
,
therefore
,
to
declare
only
the
*NL*
simple
truth
,
and
lay
open
such
facts
as
were
really
due
to
his
*NL*
character
,
without
any
embellishment
of
tenderness
to
lead
the
fancy
*NL*
astray
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
when
they
were
all
three
together
,
Marianne
began
*NL*
voluntarily
to
speak
of
him
again
;
--
but
that
it
was
not
without
an
*NL*
effort
,
the
restless
,
unquiet
thoughtfulness
in
which
she
had
been
for
*NL*
some
time
previously
sitting
--
her
rising
colour
,
as
she
spoke
,
--
and
her
*NL*
unsteady
voice
,
plainly
shewed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
assure
you
both
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
I
see
every
thing
--
as
you
*NL*
can
desire
me
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
would
have
interrupted
her
instantly
with
soothing
*NL*
tenderness
,
had
not
Elinor
,
who
really
wished
to
hear
her
sister
's
*NL*
unbiased
opinion
,
by
an
eager
sign
,
engaged
her
silence
.
Marianne
*NL*
slowly
continued
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
great
relief
to
me
--
what
Elinor
told
me
this
morning
--
I
have
*NL*
now
heard
exactly
what
I
wished
to
hear
.
''
--
For
some
moments
her
voice
*NL*
was
lost
;
but
recovering
herself
,
she
added
,
and
with
greater
calmness
*NL*
than
before
--
``
I
am
now
perfectly
satisfied
,
I
wish
for
no
change
.
I
*NL*
never
could
have
been
happy
with
him
,
after
knowing
,
as
sooner
or
later
*NL*
I
must
have
known
,
all
this
.
--
I
should
have
had
no
confidence
,
no
*NL*
esteem
.
Nothing
could
have
done
it
away
to
my
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
--
I
know
it
,
''
cried
her
mother
.
``
Happy
with
a
man
of
*NL*
libertine
practices
!
--
With
one
who
so
injured
the
peace
of
the
dearest
*NL*
of
our
friends
,
and
the
best
of
men
!
--
No
--
my
Marianne
has
not
a
heart
*NL*
to
be
made
happy
with
such
a
man
!
--
Her
conscience
,
her
sensitive
*NL*
conscience
,
would
have
felt
all
that
the
conscience
of
her
husband
*NL*
ought
to
have
felt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
sighed
,
and
repeated
,
``
I
wish
for
no
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
consider
the
matter
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
exactly
as
a
good
mind
and
a
*NL*
sound
understanding
must
consider
it
;
and
I
dare
say
you
perceive
,
as
*NL*
well
as
myself
,
not
only
in
this
,
but
in
many
other
circumstances
,
*NL*
reason
enough
to
be
convinced
that
your
marriage
must
have
involved
you
*NL*
in
many
certain
troubles
and
disappointments
,
in
which
you
would
have
*NL*
been
poorly
supported
by
an
affection
,
on
his
side
,
much
less
certain
.
*NL*
Had
you
married
,
you
must
have
been
always
poor
.
His
expensiveness
is
*NL*
acknowledged
even
by
himself
,
and
his
whole
conduct
declares
that
*NL*
self-denial
is
a
word
hardly
understood
by
him
.
His
demands
and
your
*NL*
inexperience
together
,
on
a
small
,
very
small
income
,
must
have
brought
*NL*
on
distresses
which
would
not
be
the
LESS
grievous
to
you
,
from
having
*NL*
been
entirely
unknown
and
unthought
of
before
.
YOUR
sense
of
honour
*NL*
and
honesty
would
have
led
you
,
I
know
,
when
aware
of
your
situation
,
*NL*
to
attempt
all
the
economy
that
would
appear
to
you
possible
:
and
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
as
long
as
your
frugality
retrenched
only
on
your
own
comfort
,
*NL*
you
might
have
been
suffered
to
practice
it
,
but
beyond
that
--
and
how
*NL*
little
could
the
utmost
of
your
single
management
do
to
stop
the
ruin
*NL*
which
had
begun
before
your
marriage
?
--
Beyond
THAT
,
had
you
*NL*
endeavoured
,
however
reasonably
,
to
abridge
HIS
enjoyments
,
is
it
not
*NL*
to
be
feared
,
that
instead
of
prevailing
on
feelings
so
selfish
to
*NL*
consent
to
it
,
you
would
have
lessened
your
own
influence
on
his
heart
,
*NL*
and
made
him
regret
the
connection
which
had
involved
him
in
such
*NL*
difficulties
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
's
lips
quivered
,
and
she
repeated
the
word
``
Selfish
?
''
in
a
*NL*
tone
that
implied
--
``
do
you
really
think
him
selfish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
of
his
behaviour
,
''
replied
Elinor
,
``
from
the
beginning
to
*NL*
the
end
of
the
affair
,
has
been
grounded
on
selfishness
.
It
was
*NL*
selfishness
which
first
made
him
sport
with
your
affections
;
which
*NL*
afterwards
,
when
his
own
were
engaged
,
made
him
delay
the
confession
of
*NL*
it
,
and
which
finally
carried
him
from
Barton
.
His
own
enjoyment
,
or
*NL*
his
own
ease
,
was
,
in
every
particular
,
his
ruling
principle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
true
.
MY
happiness
never
was
his
object
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
present
,
''
continued
Elinor
,
``
he
regrets
what
he
has
done
.
And
why
*NL*
does
he
regret
it
?
--
Because
he
finds
it
has
not
answered
towards
*NL*
himself
.
It
has
not
made
him
happy
.
His
circumstances
are
now
*NL*
unembarrassed
--
he
suffers
from
no
evil
of
that
kind
;
and
he
thinks
only
*NL*
that
he
has
married
a
woman
of
a
less
amiable
temper
than
yourself
.
*NL*
But
does
it
follow
that
had
he
married
you
,
he
would
have
been
*NL*
happy
?
--
The
inconveniences
would
have
been
different
.
He
would
then
*NL*
have
suffered
under
the
pecuniary
distresses
which
,
because
they
are
*NL*
removed
,
he
now
reckons
as
nothing
.
He
would
have
had
a
wife
of
whose
*NL*
temper
he
could
make
no
complaint
,
but
he
would
have
been
always
*NL*
necessitous
--
always
poor
;
and
probably
would
soon
have
learned
to
rank
*NL*
the
innumerable
comforts
of
a
clear
estate
and
good
income
as
of
far
*NL*
more
importance
,
even
to
domestic
happiness
,
than
the
mere
temper
of
a
*NL*
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
a
doubt
of
it
,
''
said
Marianne
;
``
and
I
have
nothing
to
*NL*
regret
--
nothing
but
my
own
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
say
your
mother
's
imprudence
,
my
child
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dashwood
;
*NL*
``
SHE
must
be
answerable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
would
not
let
her
proceed
;
--
and
Elinor
,
satisfied
that
each
*NL*
felt
their
own
error
,
wished
to
avoid
any
survey
of
the
past
that
might
*NL*
weaken
her
sister
's
spirits
;
she
,
therefore
,
pursuing
the
first
*NL*
subject
,
immediately
continued
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
observation
may
,
I
think
,
be
fairly
drawn
from
the
whole
of
the
*NL*
story
--
that
all
Willoughby
's
difficulties
have
arisen
from
the
first
*NL*
offence
against
virtue
,
in
his
behaviour
to
Eliza
Williams
.
That
crime
*NL*
has
been
the
origin
of
every
lesser
one
,
and
of
all
his
present
*NL*
discontents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
assented
most
feelingly
to
the
remark
;
and
her
mother
was
led
*NL*
by
it
to
an
enumeration
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
injuries
and
merits
,
warm
*NL*
as
friendship
and
design
could
unitedly
dictate
.
Her
daughter
did
not
*NL*
look
,
however
,
as
if
much
of
it
were
heard
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
,
according
to
her
expectation
,
saw
on
the
two
or
three
following
*NL*
days
,
that
Marianne
did
not
continue
to
gain
strength
as
she
had
done
;
*NL*
but
while
her
resolution
was
unsubdued
,
and
she
still
tried
to
appear
*NL*
cheerful
and
easy
,
her
sister
could
safely
trust
to
the
effect
of
time
*NL*
upon
her
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
returned
,
and
the
family
were
again
all
restored
to
each
*NL*
other
,
again
quietly
settled
at
the
cottage
;
and
if
not
pursuing
their
*NL*
usual
studies
with
quite
so
much
vigour
as
when
they
first
came
to
*NL*
Barton
,
at
least
planning
a
vigorous
prosecution
of
them
in
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
grew
impatient
for
some
tidings
of
Edward
.
She
had
heard
*NL*
nothing
of
him
since
her
leaving
London
,
nothing
new
of
his
plans
,
*NL*
nothing
certain
even
of
his
present
abode
.
Some
letters
had
passed
*NL*
between
her
and
her
brother
,
in
consequence
of
Marianne
's
illness
;
and
*NL*
in
the
first
of
John
's
,
there
had
been
this
sentence
:
--
``
We
know
*NL*
nothing
of
our
unfortunate
Edward
,
and
can
make
no
enquiries
on
so
*NL*
prohibited
a
subject
,
but
conclude
him
to
be
still
at
Oxford
;
''
which
*NL*
was
all
the
intelligence
of
Edward
afforded
her
by
the
correspondence
,
*NL*
for
his
name
was
not
even
mentioned
in
any
of
the
succeeding
letters
.
*NL*
She
was
not
doomed
,
however
,
to
be
long
in
ignorance
of
his
measures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
man-servant
had
been
sent
one
morning
to
Exeter
on
business
;
and
*NL*
when
,
as
he
waited
at
table
,
he
had
satisfied
the
inquiries
of
his
*NL*
mistress
as
to
the
event
of
his
errand
,
this
was
his
voluntary
*NL*
communication
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
know
,
ma'am
,
that
Mr.
Ferrars
is
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
gave
a
violent
start
,
fixed
her
eyes
upon
Elinor
,
saw
her
*NL*
turning
pale
,
and
fell
back
in
her
chair
in
hysterics
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
*NL*
whose
eyes
,
as
she
answered
the
servant
's
inquiry
,
had
intuitively
*NL*
taken
the
same
direction
,
was
shocked
to
perceive
by
Elinor
's
*NL*
countenance
how
much
she
really
suffered
,
and
a
moment
afterwards
,
*NL*
alike
distressed
by
Marianne
's
situation
,
knew
not
on
which
child
to
*NL*
bestow
her
principal
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
,
who
saw
only
that
Miss
Marianne
was
taken
ill
,
had
sense
*NL*
enough
to
call
one
of
the
maids
,
who
,
with
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
assistance
,
*NL*
supported
her
into
the
other
room
.
By
that
time
,
Marianne
was
rather
*NL*
better
,
and
her
mother
leaving
her
to
the
care
of
Margaret
and
the
*NL*
maid
,
returned
to
Elinor
,
who
,
though
still
much
disordered
,
had
so
far
*NL*
recovered
the
use
of
her
reason
and
voice
as
to
be
just
beginning
an
*NL*
inquiry
of
Thomas
,
as
to
the
source
of
his
intelligence
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
*NL*
immediately
took
all
that
trouble
on
herself
;
and
Elinor
had
the
*NL*
benefit
of
the
information
without
the
exertion
of
seeking
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
that
Mr.
Ferrars
was
married

Thomas

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
Mr.
Ferrars
myself
,
ma'am
,
this
morning
in
Exeter
,
and
his
lady
*NL*
too
,
Miss
Steele
as
was
.
They
was
stopping
in
a
chaise
at
the
door
of
*NL*
the
New
London
Inn
,
as
I
went
there
with
a
message
from
Sally
at
the
*NL*
Park
to
her
brother
,
who
is
one
of
the
post-boys
.
I
happened
to
look
up
*NL*
as
I
went
by
the
chaise
,
and
so
I
see
directly
it
was
the
youngest
Miss
*NL*
Steele
;
so
I
took
off
my
hat
,
and
she
knew
me
and
called
to
me
,
and
*NL*
inquired
after
you
,
ma'am
,
and
the
young
ladies
,
especially
Miss
*NL*
Marianne
,
and
bid
me
I
should
give
her
compliments
and
Mr.
Ferrars
's
,
*NL*
their
best
compliments
and
service
,
and
how
sorry
they
was
they
had
not
*NL*
time
to
come
on
and
see
you
,
but
they
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
go
*NL*
forwards
,
for
they
was
going
further
down
for
a
little
while
,
but
*NL*
howsever
,
when
they
come
back
,
they
'd
make
sure
to
come
and
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
she
tell
you
she
was
married
,
Thomas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
She
smiled
,
and
said
how
she
had
changed
her
name
since
*NL*
she
was
in
these
parts
.
She
was
always
a
very
affable
and
free-spoken
*NL*
young
lady
,
and
very
civil
behaved
.
So
,
I
made
free
to
wish
her
joy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
Mr.
Ferrars
in
the
carriage
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
I
just
see
him
leaning
back
in
it
,
but
he
did
not
look
*NL*
up
;
--
he
never
was
a
gentleman
much
for
talking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
heart
could
easily
account
for
his
not
putting
himself
*NL*
forward
;
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
probably
found
the
same
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
there
no
one
else
in
the
carriage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
,
only
they
two
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
where
they
came
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
come
straight
from
town
,
as
Miss
Lucy
--
Mrs.
Ferrars
told
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
they
going
farther
westward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
--
but
not
to
bide
long
.
They
will
soon
be
back
again
,
and
*NL*
then
they
'd
be
sure
and
call
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
now
looked
at
her
daughter
;
but
Elinor
knew
better
than
*NL*
to
expect
them
.
She
recognised
the
whole
of
Lucy
in
the
message
,
and
*NL*
was
very
confident
that
Edward
would
never
come
near
them
.
She
*NL*
observed
in
a
low
voice
,
to
her
mother
,
that
they
were
probably
going
*NL*
down
to
Mr.
Pratt
's
,
near
Plymouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thomas
's
intelligence
seemed
over
.
Elinor
looked
as
if
she
wished
to
*NL*
hear
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
them
off
,
before
you
came
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
--
the
horses
were
just
coming
out
,
but
I
could
not
bide
any
*NL*
longer
;
I
was
afraid
of
being
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Mrs.
Ferrars
look
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
she
said
how
she
was
very
well
;
and
to
my
mind
she
was
*NL*
always
a
very
handsome
young
lady
--
and
she
seemed
vastly
contented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
could
think
of
no
other
question
,
and
Thomas
and
the
*NL*
tablecloth
,
now
alike
needless
,
were
soon
afterwards
dismissed
.
*NL*
Marianne
had
already
sent
to
say
,
that
she
should
eat
nothing
more
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
and
Elinor
's
appetites
were
equally
lost
,
and
Margaret
*NL*
might
think
herself
very
well
off
,
that
with
so
much
uneasiness
as
both
*NL*
her
sisters
had
lately
experienced
,
so
much
reason
as
they
had
often
*NL*
had
to
be
careless
of
their
meals
,
she
had
never
been
obliged
to
go
*NL*
without
her
dinner
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
dessert
and
the
wine
were
arranged
,
and
Mrs.
Dashwood
and
*NL*
Elinor
were
left
by
themselves
,
they
remained
long
together
in
a
*NL*
similarity
of
thoughtfulness
and
silence
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
feared
to
*NL*
hazard
any
remark
,
and
ventured
not
to
offer
consolation
.
She
now
*NL*
found
that
she
had
erred
in
relying
on
Elinor
's
representation
of
*NL*
herself
;
and
justly
concluded
that
every
thing
had
been
expressly
*NL*
softened
at
the
time
,
to
spare
her
from
an
increase
of
unhappiness
,
*NL*
suffering
as
she
then
had
suffered
for
Marianne
.
She
found
that
she
*NL*
had
been
misled
by
the
careful
,
the
considerate
attention
of
her
*NL*
daughter
,
to
think
the
attachment
,
which
once
she
had
so
well
*NL*
understood
,
much
slighter
in
reality
,
than
she
had
been
wont
to
*NL*
believe
,
or
than
it
was
now
proved
to
be
.
She
feared
that
under
this
*NL*
persuasion
she
had
been
unjust
,
inattentive
,
nay
,
almost
unkind
,
to
her
*NL*
Elinor
;
--
that
Marianne
's
affliction
,
because
more
acknowledged
,
more
*NL*
immediately
before
her
,
had
too
much
engrossed
her
tenderness
,
and
led
*NL*
her
away
to
forget
that
in
Elinor
she
might
have
a
daughter
suffering
*NL*
almost
as
much
,
certainly
with
less
self-provocation
,
and
greater
*NL*
fortitude
.

CHAPTER
48
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
now
found
the
difference
between
the
expectation
of
an
*NL*
unpleasant
event
,
however
certain
the
mind
may
be
told
to
consider
it
,
*NL*
and
certainty
itself
.
She
now
found
,
that
in
spite
of
herself
,
she
had
*NL*
always
admitted
a
hope
,
while
Edward
remained
single
,
that
something
*NL*
would
occur
to
prevent
his
marrying
Lucy
;
that
some
resolution
of
his
*NL*
own
,
some
mediation
of
friends
,
or
some
more
eligible
opportunity
of
*NL*
establishment
for
the
lady
,
would
arise
to
assist
the
happiness
of
all
.
*NL*
But
he
was
now
married
;
and
she
condemned
her
heart
for
the
lurking
*NL*
flattery
,
which
so
much
heightened
the
pain
of
the
intelligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
he
should
be
married
soon
,
before
-LRB-
as
she
imagined
-RRB-
he
could
be
in
*NL*
orders
,
and
consequently
before
he
could
be
in
possession
of
the
*NL*
living
,
surprised
her
a
little
at
first
.
But
she
soon
saw
how
likely
*NL*
it
was
that
Lucy
,
in
her
self-provident
care
,
in
her
haste
to
secure
*NL*
him
,
should
overlook
every
thing
but
the
risk
of
delay
.
They
were
*NL*
married
,
married
in
town
,
and
now
hastening
down
to
her
uncle
's
.
What
*NL*
had
Edward
felt
on
being
within
four
miles
from
Barton
,
on
seeing
her
*NL*
mother
's
servant
,
on
hearing
Lucy
's
message
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
would
soon
,
she
supposed
,
be
settled
at
Delaford
.
--
Delaford
,
--
that
*NL*
place
in
which
so
much
conspired
to
give
her
an
interest
;
which
she
*NL*
wished
to
be
acquainted
with
,
and
yet
desired
to
avoid
.
She
saw
them
*NL*
in
an
instant
in
their
parsonage-house
;
saw
in
Lucy
,
the
active
,
*NL*
contriving
manager
,
uniting
at
once
a
desire
of
smart
appearance
with
*NL*
the
utmost
frugality
,
and
ashamed
to
be
suspected
of
half
her
*NL*
economical
practices
;
--
pursuing
her
own
interest
in
every
thought
,
*NL*
courting
the
favour
of
Colonel
Brandon
,
of
Mrs.
Jennings
,
and
of
every
*NL*
wealthy
friend
.
In
Edward
--
she
knew
not
what
she
saw
,
nor
what
she
*NL*
wished
to
see
;
--
happy
or
unhappy
,
--
nothing
pleased
her
;
she
turned
away
*NL*
her
head
from
every
sketch
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
flattered
herself
that
some
one
of
their
connections
in
London
*NL*
would
write
to
them
to
announce
the
event
,
and
give
farther
*NL*
particulars
,
--
but
day
after
day
passed
off
,
and
brought
no
letter
,
no
*NL*
tidings
.
Though
uncertain
that
any
one
were
to
blame
,
she
found
fault
*NL*
with
every
absent
friend
.
They
were
all
thoughtless
or
indolent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
you
write
to
Colonel
Brandon
,
ma'am
?
''
was
an
inquiry
which
*NL*
sprung
from
the
impatience
of
her
mind
to
have
something
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wrote
to
him
,
my
love
,
last
week
,
and
rather
expect
to
see
,
than
to
*NL*
hear
from
him
again
.
I
earnestly
pressed
his
coming
to
us
,
and
should
*NL*
not
be
surprised
to
see
him
walk
in
today
or
tomorrow
,
or
any
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
gaining
something
,
something
to
look
forward
to
.
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
must
have
some
information
to
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
had
she
so
determined
it
,
when
the
figure
of
a
man
on
*NL*
horseback
drew
her
eyes
to
the
window
.
He
stopt
at
their
gate
.
It
was
*NL*
a
gentleman
,
it
was
Colonel
Brandon
himself
.
Now
she
could
hear
more
;
*NL*
and
she
trembled
in
expectation
of
it
.
But
--
it
was
NOT
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
--
neither
his
air
--
nor
his
height
.
Were
it
possible
,
she
must
*NL*
say
it
must
be
Edward
.
She
looked
again
.
He
had
just
dismounted
;
--
she
*NL*
could
not
be
mistaken
,
--
it
WAS
Edward
.
She
moved
away
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
``
He
comes
from
Mr.
Pratt
's
purposely
to
see
us
.
I
WILL
be
calm
;
I
WILL
*NL*
be
mistress
of
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
she
perceived
that
the
others
were
likewise
aware
of
the
*NL*
mistake
.
She
saw
her
mother
and
Marianne
change
colour
;
saw
them
look
*NL*
at
herself
,
and
whisper
a
few
sentences
to
each
other
.
She
would
have
*NL*
given
the
world
to
be
able
to
speak
--
and
to
make
them
understand
that
*NL*
she
hoped
no
coolness
,
no
slight
,
would
appear
in
their
behaviour
to
*NL*
him
;
--
but
she
had
no
utterance
,
and
was
obliged
to
leave
all
to
their
*NL*
own
discretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
syllable
passed
aloud
.
They
all
waited
in
silence
for
the
*NL*
appearance
of
their
visitor
.
His
footsteps
were
heard
along
the
gravel
*NL*
path
;
in
a
moment
he
was
in
the
passage
,
and
in
another
he
was
before
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
countenance
,
as
he
entered
the
room
,
was
not
too
happy
,
even
for
*NL*
Elinor
.
His
complexion
was
white
with
agitation
,
and
he
looked
as
if
*NL*
fearful
of
his
reception
,
and
conscious
that
he
merited
no
kind
one
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
however
,
conforming
,
as
she
trusted
,
to
the
wishes
of
*NL*
that
daughter
,
by
whom
she
then
meant
in
the
warmth
of
her
heart
to
be
*NL*
guided
in
every
thing
,
met
with
a
look
of
forced
complacency
,
gave
him
*NL*
her
hand
,
and
wished
him
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
coloured
,
and
stammered
out
an
unintelligible
reply
.
Elinor
's
lips
*NL*
had
moved
with
her
mother
's
,
and
,
when
the
moment
of
action
was
over
,
*NL*
she
wished
that
she
had
shaken
hands
with
him
too
.
But
it
was
then
too
*NL*
late
,
and
with
a
countenance
meaning
to
be
open
,
she
sat
down
again
and
*NL*
talked
of
the
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
had
retreated
as
much
as
possible
out
of
sight
,
to
conceal
her
*NL*
distress
;
and
Margaret
,
understanding
some
part
,
but
not
the
whole
of
*NL*
the
case
,
thought
it
incumbent
on
her
to
be
dignified
,
and
therefore
*NL*
took
a
seat
as
far
from
him
as
she
could
,
and
maintained
a
strict
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Elinor
had
ceased
to
rejoice
in
the
dryness
of
the
season
,
a
very
*NL*
awful
pause
took
place
.
It
was
put
an
end
to
by
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
who
*NL*
felt
obliged
to
hope
that
he
had
left
Mrs.
Ferrars
very
well
.
In
a
*NL*
hurried
manner
,
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
resolving
to
exert
herself
,
though
fearing
the
sound
of
her
own
*NL*
voice
,
now
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mrs.
Ferrars
at
Longstaple
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Longstaple
!
''
he
replied
,
with
an
air
of
surprise
.
--
``
No
,
my
mother
*NL*
is
in
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
,
''
said
Elinor
,
taking
up
some
work
from
the
table
,
``
to
inquire
*NL*
for
Mrs.
EDWARD
Ferrars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dared
not
look
up
;
--
but
her
mother
and
Marianne
both
turned
their
*NL*
eyes
on
him
.
He
coloured
,
seemed
perplexed
,
looked
doubtingly
,
and
,
*NL*
after
some
hesitation
,
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
mean
--
my
brother
--
you
mean
Mrs.
--
Mrs.
ROBERT
Ferrars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Robert
Ferrars
!
''
--
was
repeated
by
Marianne
and
her
mother
in
an
*NL*
accent
of
the
utmost
amazement
;
--
and
though
Elinor
could
not
speak
,
*NL*
even
HER
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
the
same
impatient
wonder
.
He
*NL*
rose
from
his
seat
,
and
walked
to
the
window
,
apparently
from
not
*NL*
knowing
what
to
do
;
took
up
a
pair
of
scissors
that
lay
there
,
and
*NL*
while
spoiling
both
them
and
their
sheath
by
cutting
the
latter
to
*NL*
pieces
as
he
spoke
,
said
,
in
a
hurried
voice
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
do
not
know
--
you
may
not
have
heard
that
my
brother
is
*NL*
lately
married
to
--
to
the
youngest
--
to
Miss
Lucy
Steele
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
words
were
echoed
with
unspeakable
astonishment
by
all
but
Elinor
,
*NL*
who
sat
with
her
head
leaning
over
her
work
,
in
a
state
of
such
*NL*
agitation
as
made
her
hardly
know
where
she

*NL*
``
Yes

``

were
married
last
week

''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
could
sit
it
no
longer
.
She
almost
ran
out
of
the
room
,
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
,
burst
into
tears
of
joy
,
which
at
first
*NL*
she
thought
would
never
cease
.
Edward
,
who
had
till
then
looked
any
*NL*
where
,
rather
than
at
her
,
saw
her
hurry
away
,
and
perhaps
saw
--
or
even
*NL*
heard
,
her
emotion
;
for
immediately
afterwards
he
fell
into
a
reverie
,
*NL*
which
no
remarks
,
no
inquiries
,
no
affectionate
address
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashwood
could
penetrate
,
and
at
last
,
without
saying
a
word
,
quitted
*NL*
the
room
,
and
walked
out
towards
the
village
--
leaving
the
others
in
the
*NL*
greatest
astonishment
and
perplexity
on
a
change
in
his
situation
,
so
*NL*
wonderful
and
so
sudden
;
--
a
perplexity
which
they
had
no
means
of
*NL*
lessening
but
by
their
own
conjectures
.

CHAPTER
49
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Unaccountable
,
however
,
as
the
circumstances
of
his
release
might
*NL*
appear
to
the
whole
family
,
it
was
certain
that
Edward
was
free
;
and
to
*NL*
what
purpose
that
freedom
would
be
employed
was
easily
pre-determined
*NL*
by
all
;
--
for
after
experiencing
the
blessings
of
ONE
imprudent
*NL*
engagement
,
contracted
without
his
mother
's
consent
,
as
he
had
already
*NL*
done
for
more
than
four
years
,
nothing
less
could
be
expected
of
him
in
*NL*
the
failure
of
THAT
,
than
the
immediate
contraction
of
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
errand
at
Barton
,
in
fact
,
was
a
simple
one
.
It
was
only
to
ask
*NL*
Elinor
to
marry
him
;
--
and
considering
that
he
was
not
altogether
*NL*
inexperienced
in
such
a
question
,
it
might
be
strange
that
he
should
*NL*
feel
so
uncomfortable
in
the
present
case
as
he
really
did
,
so
much
in
*NL*
need
of
encouragement
and
fresh
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
soon
he
had
walked
himself
into
the
proper
resolution
,
however
,
how
*NL*
soon
an
opportunity
of
exercising
it
occurred
,
in
what
manner
he
*NL*
expressed
himself
,
and
how
he
was
received
,
need
not
be
particularly
*NL*
told
.
This
only
need
be
said
;
--
that
when
they
all
sat
down
to
table
at
*NL*
four
o'clock
,
about
three
hours
after
his
arrival
,
he
had
secured
his
*NL*
lady
,
engaged
her
mother
's
consent
,
and
was
not
only
in
the
rapturous
*NL*
profession
of
the
lover
,
but
,
in
the
reality
of
reason
and
truth
,
one
*NL*
of
the
happiest
of
men
.
His
situation
indeed
was
more
than
commonly
*NL*
joyful
.
He
had
more
than
the
ordinary
triumph
of
accepted
love
to
*NL*
swell
his
heart
,
and
raise
his
spirits
.
He
was
released
without
any
*NL*
reproach
to
himself
,
from
an
entanglement
which
had
long
formed
his
*NL*
misery
,
from
a
woman
whom
he
had
long
ceased
to
love
;
--
and
elevated
at
*NL*
once
to
that
security
with
another
,
which
he
must
have
thought
of
*NL*
almost
with
despair
,
as
soon
as
he
had
learnt
to
consider
it
with
*NL*
desire
.
He
was
brought
,
not
from
doubt
or
suspense
,
but
from
misery
to
*NL*
happiness
;
--
and
the
change
was
openly
spoken
in
such
a
genuine
,
*NL*
flowing
,
grateful
cheerfulness
,
as
his
friends
had
never
witnessed
in
*NL*
him
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
was
now
open
to
Elinor
,
all
its
weaknesses
,
all
its
errors
*NL*
confessed
,
and
his
first
boyish
attachment
to
Lucy
treated
with
all
the
*NL*
philosophic
dignity
of
twenty-four
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
foolish
,
idle
inclination
on
my
side
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
*NL*
consequence
of
ignorance
of
the
world
--
and
want
of
employment
.
Had
my
*NL*
mother
given
me
some
active
profession
when
I
was
removed
at
eighteen
*NL*
from
the
care
of
Mr.
Pratt
,
I
think
--
nay
,
I
am
sure
,
it
would
never
*NL*
have
happened
;
for
though
I
left
Longstaple
with
what
I
thought
,
at
the
*NL*
time
,
a
most
unconquerable
preference
for
his
niece
,
yet
had
I
then
had
*NL*
any
pursuit
,
any
object
to
engage
my
time
and
keep
me
at
a
distance
*NL*
from
her
for
a
few
months
,
I
should
very
soon
have
outgrown
the
fancied
*NL*
attachment
,
especially
by
mixing
more
with
the
world
,
as
in
such
case
I
*NL*
must
have
done
.
But
instead
of
having
any
thing
to
do
,
instead
of
*NL*
having
any
profession
chosen
for
me
,
or
being
allowed
to
chuse
any
*NL*
myself
,
I
returned
home
to
be
completely
idle
;
and
for
the
first
*NL*
twelvemonth
afterwards
I
had
not
even
the
nominal
employment
,
which
*NL*
belonging
to
the
university
would
have
given
me
;
for
I
was
not
entered
*NL*
at
Oxford
till
I
was
nineteen
.
I
had
therefore
nothing
in
the
world
to
*NL*
do
,
but
to
fancy
myself
in
love
;
and
as
my
mother
did
not
make
my
home
*NL*
in
every
respect
comfortable
,
as
I
had
no
friend
,
no
companion
in
my
*NL*
brother
,
and
disliked
new
acquaintance
,
it
was
not
unnatural
for
me
to
*NL*
be
very
often
at
Longstaple
,
where
I
always
felt
myself
at
home
,
and
*NL*
was
always
sure
of
a
welcome
;
and
accordingly
I
spent
the
greatest
part
*NL*
of
my
time
there
from
eighteen
to
nineteen
:
Lucy
appeared
everything
*NL*
that
was
amiable
and
obliging
.
She
was
pretty
too
--
at
least
I
thought
*NL*
so
THEN
;
and
I
had
seen
so
little
of
other
women
,
that
I
could
make
no
*NL*
comparisons
,
and
see
no
defects
.
Considering
everything
,
therefore
,
I
*NL*
hope
,
foolish
as
our
engagement
was
,
foolish
as
it
has
since
in
every
*NL*
way
been
proved
,
it
was
not
at
the
time
an
unnatural
or
an
inexcusable
*NL*
piece
of
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
change
which
a
few
hours
had
wrought
in
the
minds
and
the
happiness
*NL*
of
the
Dashwoods
,
was
such
--
so
great
--
as
promised
them
all
,
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
a
sleepless
night
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
too
happy
to
be
*NL*
comfortable
,
knew
not
how
to
love
Edward
,
nor
praise
Elinor
enough
,
how
*NL*
to
be
enough
thankful
for
his
release
without
wounding
his
delicacy
,
*NL*
nor
how
at
once
to
give
them
leisure
for
unrestrained
conversation
*NL*
together
,
and
yet
enjoy
,
as
she
wished
,
the
sight
and
society
of
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
could
speak
HER
happiness
only
by
tears
.
Comparisons
would
*NL*
occur
--
regrets
would
arise
;
--
and
her
joy
,
though
sincere
as
her
love
*NL*
for
her
sister
,
was
of
a
kind
to
give
her
neither
spirits
nor
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Elinor
--
how
are
HER
feelings
to
be
described
?
--
From
the
moment
of
*NL*
learning
that
Lucy
was
married
to
another
,
that
Edward
was
free
,
to
the
*NL*
moment
of
his
justifying
the
hopes
which
had
so
instantly
followed
,
she
*NL*
was
every
thing
by
turns
but
tranquil
.
But
when
the
second
moment
had
*NL*
passed
,
when
she
found
every
doubt
,
every
solicitude
removed
,
compared
*NL*
her
situation
with
what
so
lately
it
had
been
,
--
saw
him
honourably
*NL*
released
from
his
former
engagement
,
saw
him
instantly
profiting
by
the
*NL*
release
,
to
address
herself
and
declare
an
affection
as
tender
,
as
*NL*
constant
as
she
had
ever
supposed
it
to
be
,
--
she
was
oppressed
,
she
was
*NL*
overcome
by
her
own
felicity
;
--
and
happily
disposed
as
is
the
human
*NL*
mind
to
be
easily
familiarized
with
any
change
for
the
better
,
it
*NL*
required
several
hours
to
give
sedateness
to
her
spirits
,
or
any
degree
*NL*
of
tranquillity
to
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
was
now
fixed
at
the
cottage
at
least
for
a
week
;
--
for
whatever
*NL*
other
claims
might
be
made
on
him
,
it
was
impossible
that
less
than
a
*NL*
week
should
be
given
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
Elinor
's
company
,
or
*NL*
suffice
to
say
half
that
was
to
be
said
of
the
past
,
the
present
,
and
*NL*
the
future
;
--
for
though
a
very
few
hours
spent
in
the
hard
labor
of
*NL*
incessant
talking
will
despatch
more
subjects
than
can
really
be
in
*NL*
common
between
any
two
rational
creatures
,
yet
with
lovers
it
is
*NL*
different
.
Between
THEM
no
subject
is
finished
,
no
communication
is
*NL*
even
made
,
till
it
has
been
made
at
least
twenty
times
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
's
marriage
,
the
unceasing
and
reasonable
wonder
among
them
all
,
*NL*
formed
of
course
one
of
the
earliest
discussions
of
the
lovers
;
--
and
*NL*
Elinor
's
particular
knowledge
of
each
party
made
it
appear
to
her
in
*NL*
every
view
,
as
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
unaccountable
*NL*
circumstances
she
had
ever
heard
.
How
they
could
be
thrown
together
,
*NL*
and
by
what
attraction
Robert
could
be
drawn
on
to
marry
a
girl
,
of
*NL*
whose
beauty
she
had
herself
heard
him
speak
without
any
admiration
,
--
a
*NL*
girl
too
already
engaged
to
his
brother
,
and
on
whose
account
that
*NL*
brother
had
been
thrown
off
by
his
family
--
it
was
beyond
her
*NL*
comprehension
to
make
out
.
To
her
own
heart
it
was
a
delightful
*NL*
affair
,
to
her
imagination
it
was
even
a
ridiculous
one
,
but
to
her
*NL*
reason
,
her
judgment
,
it
was
completely
a
puzzle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
could
only
attempt
an
explanation
by
supposing
,
that
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
at
first
accidentally
meeting
,
the
vanity
of
the
one
had
been
so
worked
*NL*
on
by
the
flattery
of
the
other
,
as
to
lead
by
degrees
to
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
Elinor
remembered
what
Robert
had
told
her
in
Harley
Street
,
of
his
*NL*
opinion
of
what
his
own
mediation
in
his
brother
's
affairs
might
have
*NL*
done
,
if
applied
to
in
time
.
She
repeated
it
to
Edward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
THAT
was
exactly
like
Robert
,
''
--
was
his
immediate
observation
.
--
``
And
*NL*
THAT
,
''
he
presently
added
,
``
might
perhaps
be
in
HIS
head
when
the
*NL*
acquaintance
between
them
first
began
.
And
Lucy
perhaps
at
first
might
*NL*
think
only
of
procuring
his
good
offices
in
my
favour
.
Other
designs
*NL*
might
afterward
arise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
long
it
had
been
carrying
on
between
them
,
however
,
he
was
equally
*NL*
at
a
loss
with
herself
to
make
out
;
for
at
Oxford
,
where
he
had
*NL*
remained
for
choice
ever
since
his
quitting
London
,
he
had
had
no
means
*NL*
of
hearing
of
her
but
from
herself
,
and
her
letters
to
the
very
last
*NL*
were
neither
less
frequent
,
nor
less
affectionate
than
usual
.
Not
the
*NL*
smallest
suspicion
,
therefore
,
had
ever
occurred
to
prepare
him
for
*NL*
what
followed
;
--
and
when
at
last
it
burst
on
him
in
a
letter
from
Lucy
*NL*
herself
,
he
had
been
for
some
time
,
he
believed
,
half
stupified
between
*NL*
the
wonder
,
the
horror
,
and
the
joy
of
such
a
deliverance
.
He
put
the
*NL*
letter
into
Elinor
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
DEAR
SIR

*NL*
on
another

have
no
doubt
of
being
as
happy
with
*NL*
him
as
I
once
used
to
think
I
might
be
with
you
;

I
scorn

are
just
returned

are

weeks

place
your

great
curiosity
to
see

thought

*NL*
Elinor
read
and
returned
it
without
any
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
ask
your
opinion
of
it

a
composition

said

Edward
.

``
For

I

have
blushed
over

pages

I
believe
I
may
say

that

first
half
year

foolish

business

this
is
the

only
letter
I
ever
received

*NL*
``
However
it
may
have
come

said
Elinor
,
after
a
pause

``
they

certainly

The
independence

resentment
against

has
put
it
in
his
power
to
make

hurt
by
it
,
for
Robert
always
was
her
favourite
.
--
She
*NL*
will
be
more
hurt
by
it
,
and
on
the
same
principle
will
forgive
him
*NL*
much
sooner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
what
state
the
affair
stood
at
present
between
them
,
Edward
knew
*NL*
not
,
for
no
communication
with
any
of
his
family
had
yet
been
attempted
*NL*
by
him
.
He
had
quitted
Oxford
within
four
and
twenty
hours
after
*NL*
Lucy
's
letter
arrived
,
and
with
only
one
object
before
him
,
the
nearest
*NL*
road
to
Barton
,
had
had
no
leisure
to
form
any
scheme
of
conduct
,
with
*NL*
which
that
road
did
not
hold
the
most
intimate
connection
.
He
could
do
*NL*
nothing
till
he
were
assured
of
his
fate
with
Miss
Dashwood
;
and
by
his
*NL*
rapidity
in
seeking
THAT
fate
,
it
is
to
be
supposed
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
jealousy
with
which
he
had
once
thought
of
Colonel
Brandon
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
modesty
with
which
he
rated
his
own
deserts
,
and
the
politeness
*NL*
with
which
he
talked
of
his
doubts
,
he
did
not
,
upon
the
whole
,
expect
*NL*
a
very
cruel
reception
.
It
was
his
business
,
however
,
to
say
that
he
*NL*
DID
,
and
he
said
it
very
prettily
.
What
he
might
say
on
the
subject
a
*NL*
twelvemonth
after
,
must
be
referred
to
the
imagination
of
husbands
and
*NL*
wives
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
Lucy
had
certainly
meant
to
deceive
,
to
go
off
with
a
flourish
of
*NL*
malice
against
him
in
her
message
by
Thomas
,
was
perfectly
clear
to
*NL*
Elinor
;
and
Edward
himself
,
now
thoroughly
enlightened
on
her
*NL*
character
,
had
no
scruple
in
believing
her
capable
of
the
utmost
*NL*
meanness
of
wanton
ill-nature
.
Though
his
eyes
had
been
long
opened
,
*NL*
even
before
his
acquaintance
with
Elinor
began
,
to
her
ignorance
and
a
*NL*
want
of
liberality
in
some
of
her
opinions
--
they
had
been
equally
*NL*
imputed
,
by
him
,
to
her
want
of
education
;
and
till
her
last
letter
*NL*
reached
him
,
he
had
always
believed
her
to
be
a
well-disposed
,
*NL*
good-hearted
girl
,
and
thoroughly
attached
to
himself
.
Nothing
but
*NL*
such
a
persuasion
could
have
prevented
his
putting
an
end
to
an
*NL*
engagement
,
which
,
long
before
the
discovery
of
it
laid
him
open
to
his
*NL*
mother
's
anger
,
had
been
a
continual
source
of
disquiet
and
regret
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
my
duty
,
''
said
he
,
``
independent
of
my
feelings
,
to
give
*NL*
her
the
option
of
continuing
the
engagement
or
not
,
when
I
was
*NL*
renounced
by
my
mother
,
and
stood
to
all
appearance
without
a
friend
in
*NL*
the
world
to
assist
me
.
In
such
a
situation
as
that
,
where
there
*NL*
seemed
nothing
to
tempt
the
avarice
or
the
vanity
of
any
living
*NL*
creature
,
how
could
I
suppose
,
when
she
so
earnestly
,
so
warmly
*NL*
insisted
on
sharing
my
fate
,
whatever
it
might
be
,
that
any
thing
but
*NL*
the
most
disinterested
affection
was
her
inducement
?
And
even
now
,
I
*NL*
can
not
comprehend
on
what
motive
she
acted
,
or
what
fancied
advantage
*NL*
it
could
be
to
her
,
to
be
fettered
to
a
man
for
whom
she
had
not
the
*NL*
smallest
regard
,
and
who
had
only
two
thousand
pounds
in
the
world
.
*NL*
She
could
not
foresee
that
Colonel
Brandon
would
give
me
a
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
she
might
suppose
that
something
would
occur
in
your
favour
;
*NL*
that
your
own
family
might
in
time
relent
.
And
at
any
rate
,
she
lost
*NL*
nothing
by
continuing
the
engagement
,
for
she
has
proved
that
it
*NL*
fettered
neither
her
inclination
nor
her
actions
.
The
connection
was
*NL*
certainly
a
respectable
one
,
and
probably
gained
her
consideration
*NL*
among
her
friends
;
and
,
if
nothing
more
advantageous
occurred
,
it
would
*NL*
be
better
for
her
to
marry
YOU
than
be
single
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
was
,
of
course
,
immediately
convinced
that
nothing
could
have
*NL*
been
more
natural
than
Lucy
's
conduct
,
nor
more
self-evident
than
the
*NL*
motive
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
scolded
him
,
harshly
as
ladies
always
scold
the
imprudence
which
*NL*
compliments
themselves
,
for
having
spent
so
much
time
with
them
at
*NL*
Norland
,
when
he
must
have
felt
his
own
inconstancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
behaviour
was
certainly
very
wrong
,
''
said
she
;
``
because
--
to
say
*NL*
nothing
of
my
own
conviction
,
our
relations
were
all
led
away
by
it
to
*NL*
fancy
and
expect
WHAT
,
as
you
were
THEN
situated
,
could
never
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
only
plead
an
ignorance
of
his
own
heart
,
and
a
mistaken
*NL*
confidence
in
the
force
of
his
engagement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
simple
enough
to
think
,
that
because
my
FAITH
was
plighted
to
*NL*
another
,
there
could
be
no
danger
in
my
being
with
you
;
and
that
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
my
engagement
was
to
keep
my
heart
as
safe
and
sacred
*NL*
as
my
honour
.
I
felt
that
I
admired
you
,
but
I
told
myself
it
was
only
*NL*
friendship
;
and
till
I
began
to
make
comparisons
between
yourself
and
*NL*
Lucy
,
I
did
not
know
how
far
I
was
got
.
After
that
,
I
suppose
,
I
WAS
*NL*
wrong
in
remaining
so
much
in
Sussex
,
and
the
arguments
with
which
I
*NL*
reconciled
myself
to
the
expediency
of
it
,
were
no
better
than
*NL*
these
:
--
The
danger
is
my
own
;
I
am
doing
no
injury
to
anybody
but
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
smiled
,
and
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
heard
with
pleasure
of
Colonel
Brandon
's
being
expected
at
the
*NL*
Cottage
,
as
he
really
wished
not
only
to
be
better
acquainted
with
him
,
*NL*
but
to
have
an
opportunity
of
convincing
him
that
he
no
longer
resented
*NL*
his
giving
him
the
living
of
Delaford
--
``
Which
,
at
present
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
after
thanks
so
ungraciously
delivered
as
mine
were
on
the
occasion
,
*NL*
he
must
think
I
have
never
forgiven
him
for
offering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
NOW
he
felt
astonished
himself
that
he
had
never
yet
been
to
the
place
.
*NL*
But
so
little
interest
had
he
taken
in
the
matter
,
that
he
owed
all
his
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
house
,
garden
,
and
glebe
,
extent
of
the
parish
,
*NL*
condition
of
the
land
,
and
rate
of
the
tithes
,
to
Elinor
herself
,
who
*NL*
had
heard
so
much
of
it
from
Colonel
Brandon
,
and
heard
it
with
so
much
*NL*
attention
,
as
to
be
entirely
mistress
of
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
question
after
this
only
remained
undecided
,
between
them
,
one
*NL*
difficulty
only
was
to
be
overcome
.
They
were
brought
together
by
*NL*
mutual
affection
,
with
the
warmest
approbation
of
their
real
friends
;
*NL*
their
intimate
knowledge
of
each
other
seemed
to
make
their
happiness
*NL*
certain
--
and
they
only
wanted
something
to
live
upon
.
Edward
had
two
*NL*
thousand
pounds
,
and
Elinor
one
,
which
,
with
Delaford
living
,
was
all
*NL*
that
they
could
call
their
own
;
for
it
was
impossible
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashwood
should
advance
anything
;
and
they
were
neither
of
them
quite
*NL*
enough
in
love
to
think
that
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a-year
*NL*
would
supply
them
with
the
comforts
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
was
not
entirely
without
hopes
of
some
favourable
change
in
his
*NL*
mother
towards
him
;
and
on
THAT
he
rested
for
the
residue
of
their
*NL*
income
.
But
Elinor
had
no
such
dependence
;
for
since
Edward
would
*NL*
still
be
unable
to
marry
Miss
Morton
,
and
his
chusing
herself
had
been
*NL*
spoken
of
in
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
flattering
language
as
only
a
lesser
evil
*NL*
than
his
chusing
Lucy
Steele
,
she
feared
that
Robert
's
offence
would
*NL*
serve
no
other
purpose
than
to
enrich
Fanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
four
days
after
Edward
's
arrival
Colonel
Brandon
appeared
,
to
*NL*
complete
Mrs.
Dashwood
's
satisfaction
,
and
to
give
her
the
dignity
of
*NL*
having
,
for
the
first
time
since
her
living
at
Barton
,
more
company
*NL*
with
her
than
her
house
would
hold
.
Edward
was
allowed
to
retain
the
*NL*
privilege
of
first
comer
,
and
Colonel
Brandon
therefore
walked
every
*NL*
night
to
his
old
quarters
at
the
Park
;
from
whence
he
usually
returned
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
early
enough
to
interrupt
the
lovers
'
first
tete-a-tete
*NL*
before
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
three
weeks
'
residence
at
Delaford
,
where
,
in
his
evening
hours
at
*NL*
least
,
he
had
little
to
do
but
to
calculate
the
disproportion
between
*NL*
thirty-six
and
seventeen
,
brought
him
to
Barton
in
a
temper
of
mind
*NL*
which
needed
all
the
improvement
in
Marianne
's
looks
,
all
the
kindness
*NL*
of
her
welcome
,
and
all
the
encouragement
of
her
mother
's
language
,
to
*NL*
make
it
cheerful
.
Among
such
friends
,
however
,
and
such
flattery
,
he
*NL*
did
revive
.
No
rumour
of
Lucy
's
marriage
had
yet
reached
him
:
--
he
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
what
had
passed
;
and
the
first
hours
of
his
visit
were
*NL*
consequently
spent
in
hearing
and
in
wondering
.
Every
thing
was
*NL*
explained
to
him
by
Mrs.
Dashwood
,
and
he
found
fresh
reason
to
rejoice
*NL*
in
what
he
had
done
for
Mr.
Ferrars
,
since
eventually
it
promoted
the
*NL*
interest
of
Elinor
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
needless
to
say
,
that
the
gentlemen
advanced
in
the
good
*NL*
opinion
of
each
other
,
as
they
advanced
in
each
other
's
acquaintance
,
*NL*
for
it
could
not
be
otherwise
.
Their
resemblance
in
good
principles
*NL*
and
good
sense
,
in
disposition
and
manner
of
thinking
,
would
probably
*NL*
have
been
sufficient
to
unite
them
in
friendship
,
without
any
other
*NL*
attraction
;
but
their
being
in
love
with
two
sisters
,
and
two
sisters
*NL*
fond
of
each
other
,
made
that
mutual
regard
inevitable
and
immediate
,
*NL*
which
might
otherwise
have
waited
the
effect
of
time
and
judgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letters
from
town
,
which
a
few
days
before
would
have
made
every
*NL*
nerve
in
Elinor
's
body
thrill
with
transport
,
now
arrived
to
be
read
*NL*
with
less
emotion
than
mirth
.
Mrs.
Jennings
wrote
to
tell
the
*NL*
wonderful
tale
,
to
vent
her
honest
indignation
against
the
jilting
*NL*
girl
,
and
pour
forth
her
compassion
towards
poor
Mr.
Edward
,
who
,
she
*NL*
was
sure
,
had
quite
doted
upon
the
worthless
hussy
,
and
was
now
,
by
all
*NL*
accounts
,
almost
broken-hearted
,
at
Oxford
.
--
``
I
do
think
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
,
``
nothing
was
ever
carried
on
so
sly
;
for
it
was
but
two
days
*NL*
before
Lucy
called
and
sat
a
couple
of
hours
with
me
.
Not
a
soul
*NL*
suspected
anything
of
the
matter
,
not
even
Nancy
,
who
,
poor
soul
!
came
*NL*
crying
to
me
the
day
after
,
in
a
great
fright
for
fear
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
*NL*
as
well
as
not
knowing
how
to
get
to
Plymouth
;
for
Lucy
it
seems
*NL*
borrowed
all
her
money
before
she
went
off
to
be
married
,
on
purpose
we
*NL*
suppose
to
make
a
show
with
,
and
poor
Nancy
had
not
seven
shillings
in
*NL*
the
world
;
--
so
I
was
very
glad
to
give
her
five
guineas
to
take
her
*NL*
down
to
Exeter
,
where
she
thinks
of
staying
three
or
four
weeks
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Burgess
,
in
hopes
,
as
I
tell
her
,
to
fall
in
with
the
Doctor
*NL*
again
.
And
I
must
say
that
Lucy
's
crossness
not
to
take
them
along
*NL*
with
them
in
the
chaise
is
worse
than
all
.
Poor
Mr.
Edward
!
I
can
not
*NL*
get
him
out
of
my
head
,
but
you
must
send
for
him
to
Barton
,
and
Miss
*NL*
Marianne
must
try
to
comfort
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dashwood
's
strains
were
more
solemn
.
Mrs.
Ferrars
was
the
most
*NL*
unfortunate
of
women
--
poor
Fanny
had
suffered
agonies
of
*NL*
sensibility
--
and
he
considered
the
existence
of
each
,
under
such
a
*NL*
blow
,
with
grateful
wonder
.
Robert
's
offence
was
unpardonable
,
but
*NL*
Lucy
's
was
infinitely
worse
.
Neither
of
them
were
ever
again
to
be
*NL*
mentioned
to
Mrs.
Ferrars
;
and
even
,
if
she
might
hereafter
be
induced
*NL*
to
forgive
her
son
,
his
wife
should
never
be
acknowledged
as
her
*NL*
daughter
,
nor
be
permitted
to
appear
in
her
presence
.
The
secrecy
with
*NL*
which
everything
had
been
carried
on
between
them
,
was
rationally
*NL*
treated
as
enormously
heightening
the
crime
,
because
,
had
any
suspicion
*NL*
of
it
occurred
to
the
others
,
proper
measures
would
have
been
taken
to
*NL*
prevent
the
marriage
;
and
he
called
on
Elinor
to
join
with
him
in
*NL*
regretting
that
Lucy
's
engagement
with
Edward
had
not
rather
been
*NL*
fulfilled
,
than
that
she
should
thus
be
the
means
of
spreading
misery
*NL*
farther
in
the
family
.
--
He
thus
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Ferrars
has
never
yet
mentioned
Edward
's
name
,
which
does
not
*NL*
surprise
us
;
but
,
to
our
great
astonishment
,
not
a
line
has
been
*NL*
received
from
him
on
the
occasion
.
Perhaps
,
however
,
he
is
kept
silent
*NL*
by
his
fear
of
offending
,
and
I
shall
,
therefore
,
give
him
a
hint
,
by
a
*NL*
line
to
Oxford
,
that
his
sister
and
I
both
think
a
letter
of
proper
*NL*
submission
from
him
,
addressed
perhaps
to
Fanny
,
and
by
her
shewn
to
*NL*
her
mother
,
might
not
be
taken
amiss
;
for
we
all
know
the
tenderness
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Ferrars
's
heart
,
and
that
she
wishes
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
*NL*
on
good
terms
with
her
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
paragraph
was
of
some
importance
to
the
prospects
and
conduct
of
*NL*
Edward
.
It
determined
him
to
attempt
a
reconciliation
,
though
not
*NL*
exactly
in
the
manner
pointed
out
by
their
brother
and
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
letter
of
proper
submission
!
''
repeated
he
;
``
would
they
have
me
beg
*NL*
my
mother
's
pardon
for
Robert
's
ingratitude
to
HER
,
and
breach
of
*NL*
honour
to
ME
?
--
I
can
make
no
submission
--
I
am
grown
neither
humble
nor
*NL*
penitent
by
what
has
passed
.
--
I
am
grown
very
happy
;
but
that
would
not
*NL*
interest
.
--
I
know
of
no
submission
that
IS
proper
for
me
to
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
certainly
ask
to
be
forgiven
,
''
said
Elinor
,
``
because
you
have
*NL*
offended
;
--
and
I
should
think
you
might
NOW
venture
so
far
as
to
*NL*
profess
some
concern
for
having
ever
formed
the
engagement
which
drew
*NL*
on
you
your
mother
's
anger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
agreed
that
he
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
she
has
forgiven
you
,
perhaps
a
little
humility
may
be
*NL*
convenient
while
acknowledging
a
second
engagement
,
almost
as
imprudent
*NL*
in
HER
eyes
as
the
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
nothing
to
urge
against
it
,
but
still
resisted
the
idea
of
a
*NL*
letter
of
proper
submission
;
and
therefore
,
to
make
it
easier
to
him
,
*NL*
as
he
declared
a
much
greater
willingness
to
make
mean
concessions
by
*NL*
word
of
mouth
than
on
paper
,
it
was
resolved
that
,
instead
of
writing
*NL*
to
Fanny
,
he
should
go
to
London
,
and
personally
intreat
her
good
*NL*
offices
in
his
favour
.
--
``
And
if
they
really
DO
interest
themselves
,
''
*NL*
said
Marianne
,
in
her
new
character
of
candour
,
``
in
bringing
about
a
*NL*
reconciliation
,
I
shall
think
that
even
John
and
Fanny
are
not
entirely
*NL*
without
merit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
visit
on
Colonel
Brandon
's
side
of
only
three
or
four
days
,
the
*NL*
two
gentlemen
quitted
Barton
together
.
--
They
were
to
go
immediately
to
*NL*
Delaford
,
that
Edward
might
have
some
personal
knowledge
of
his
future
*NL*
home
,
and
assist
his
patron
and
friend
in
deciding
on
what
improvements
*NL*
were
needed
to
it
;
and
from
thence
,
after
staying
there
a
couple
of

nights

CHAPTER
50
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
proper
resistance
on
the
part
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
just
so
violent
*NL*
and
so
steady
as
to
preserve
her
from
that
reproach
which
she
always
*NL*
seemed
fearful
of
incurring
,
the
reproach
of
being
too
amiable
,
Edward
*NL*
was
admitted
to
her
presence
,
and
pronounced
to
be
again
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
family
had
of
late
been
exceedingly
fluctuating
.
For
many
years
of
*NL*
her
life
she
had
had
two
sons
;
but
the
crime
and
annihilation
of
Edward
*NL*
a
few
weeks
ago
,
had
robbed
her
of
one
;
the
similar
annihilation
of
*NL*
Robert
had
left
her
for
a
fortnight
without
any
;
and
now
,
by
the
*NL*
resuscitation
of
Edward
,
she
had
one
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
being
allowed
once
more
to
live
,
however
,
he
did
not
*NL*
feel
the
continuance
of
his
existence
secure
,
till
he
had
revealed
his
*NL*
present
engagement
;
for
the
publication
of
that
circumstance
,
he
*NL*
feared
,
might
give
a
sudden
turn
to
his
constitution
,
and
carry
him
off
*NL*
as
rapidly
as
before
.
With
apprehensive
caution
therefore
it
was
*NL*
revealed
,
and
he
was
listened
to
with
unexpected
calmness
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Ferrars
at
first
reasonably
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
marrying
*NL*
Miss
Dashwood
,
by
every
argument
in
her
power
;
--
told
him
,
that
in
Miss
*NL*
Morton
he
would
have
a
woman
of
higher
rank
and
larger
fortune
;
--
and
*NL*
enforced
the
assertion
,
by
observing
that
Miss
Morton
was
the
daughter
*NL*
of
a
nobleman
with
thirty
thousand
pounds
,
while
Miss
Dashwood
was
only
*NL*
the
daughter
of
a
private
gentleman
with
no
more
than
THREE
;
but
when
*NL*
she
found
that
,
though
perfectly
admitting
the
truth
of
her
*NL*
representation
,
he
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
be
guided
by
it
,
she
*NL*
judged
it
wisest
,
from
the
experience
of
the
past
,
to
submit
--
and
*NL*
therefore
,
after
such
an
ungracious
delay
as
she
owed
to
her
own
*NL*
dignity
,
and
as
served
to
prevent
every
suspicion
of
good-will
,
she
*NL*
issued
her
decree
of
consent
to
the
marriage
of
Edward
and
Elinor
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
she
would
engage
to
do
towards
augmenting
their
income
was
next
to
*NL*
be
considered
;
and
here
it
plainly
appeared
,
that
though
Edward
was
now
*NL*
her
only
son
,
he
was
by
no
means
her
eldest
;
for
while
Robert
was
*NL*
inevitably
endowed
with
a
thousand
pounds
a-year
,
not
the
smallest
*NL*
objection
was
made
against
Edward
's
taking
orders
for
the
sake
of
two
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
at
the
utmost
;
nor
was
anything
promised
either
for
*NL*
the
present
or
in
future
,
beyond
the
ten
thousand
pounds
,
which
had
*NL*
been
given
with
Fanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
much
,
however
,
as
was
desired
,
and
more
than
was
expected
,
by
*NL*
Edward
and
Elinor
;
and
Mrs.
Ferrars
herself
,
by
her
shuffling
excuses
,
*NL*
seemed
the
only
person
surprised
at
her
not
giving
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
an
income
quite
sufficient
to
their
wants
thus
secured
to
them
,
*NL*
they
had
nothing
to
wait
for
after
Edward
was
in
possession
of
the
*NL*
living
,
but
the
readiness
of
the
house
,
to
which
Colonel
Brandon
,
with
*NL*
an
eager
desire
for
the
accommodation
of
Elinor
,
was
making
*NL*
considerable
improvements
;
and
after
waiting
some
time
for
their
*NL*
completion
,
after
experiencing
,
as
usual
,
a
thousand
disappointments
*NL*
and
delays
from
the
unaccountable
dilatoriness
of
the
workmen
,
Elinor
,
*NL*
as
usual
,
broke
through
the
first
positive
resolution
of
not
marrying
*NL*
till
every
thing
was
ready
,
and
the
ceremony
took
place
in
Barton
*NL*
church
early
in
the
autumn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
month
after
their
marriage
was
spent
with
their
friend
at
the
*NL*
Mansion-house
;
from
whence
they
could
superintend
the
progress
of
the
*NL*
Parsonage
,
and
direct
every
thing
as
they
liked
on
the
spot
;
--
could
*NL*
chuse
papers
,
project
shrubberies
,
and
invent
a
sweep
.
Mrs.
Jennings
's
*NL*
prophecies
,
though
rather
jumbled
together
,
were
chiefly
fulfilled
;
for
*NL*
she
was
able
to
visit
Edward
and
his
wife
in
their
Parsonage
by
*NL*
Michaelmas
,
and
she
found
in
Elinor
and
her
husband
,
as
she
really
*NL*
believed
,
one
of
the
happiest
couples
in
the
world
.
They
had
in
fact
*NL*
nothing
to
wish
for
,
but
the
marriage
of
Colonel
Brandon
and
Marianne
,
*NL*
and
rather
better
pasturage
for
their
cows
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
visited
on
their
first
settling
by
almost
all
their
relations
*NL*
and
friends
.
Mrs.
Ferrars
came
to
inspect
the
happiness
which
she
was
*NL*
almost
ashamed
of
having
authorised
;
and
even
the
Dashwoods
were
at
the
*NL*
expense
of
a
journey
from
Sussex
to
do
them
honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
say
that
I
am
disappointed
,
my
dear
sister
,
''
said
John
,
as
*NL*
they
were
walking
together
one
morning
before
the
gates
of
Delaford
*NL*
House
,
``
THAT
would
be
saying
too
much
,
for
certainly
you
have
been
one
*NL*
of
the
most
fortunate
young
women
in
the
world
,
as
it
is
.
But
,
I
*NL*
confess
,
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
to
call
Colonel
Brandon
*NL*
brother
.
His
property
here
,
his
place
,
his
house
,
every
thing
is
in
*NL*
such
respectable
and
excellent
condition
!
--
and
his
woods
!
--
I
have
not
*NL*
seen
such
timber
any
where
in
Dorsetshire
,
as
there
is
now
standing
in
*NL*
Delaford
Hanger
!
--
And
though
,
perhaps
,
Marianne
may
not
seem
exactly
*NL*
the
person
to
attract
him
--
yet
I
think
it
would
altogether
be
advisable
*NL*
for
you
to
have
them
now
frequently
staying
with
you
,
for
as
Colonel
*NL*
Brandon
seems
a
great
deal
at
home
,
nobody
can
tell
what
may
*NL*
happen
--
for
,
when
people
are
much
thrown
together
,
and
see
little
of
*NL*
anybody
else
--
and
it
will
always
be
in
your
power
to
set
her
off
to
*NL*
advantage
,
and
so
forth
;
--
in
short
,
you
may
as
well
give
her
a
*NL*
chance
--
You
understand
me
.
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
Mrs.
Ferrars
DID
come
to
see
them
,
and
always
treated
them
*NL*
with
the
make-believe
of
decent
affection
,
they
were
never
insulted
by
*NL*
her
real
favour
and
preference
.
THAT
was
due
to
the
folly
of
Robert
,
*NL*
and
the
cunning
of
his
wife
;
and
it
was
earned
by
them
before
many
*NL*
months
had
passed
away
.
The
selfish
sagacity
of
the
latter
,
which
had
*NL*
at
first
drawn
Robert
into
the
scrape
,
was
the
principal
instrument
of
*NL*
his
deliverance
from
it
;
for
her
respectful
humility
,
assiduous
*NL*
attentions
,
and
endless
flatteries
,
as
soon
as
the
smallest
opening
was
*NL*
given
for
their
exercise
,
reconciled
Mrs.
Ferrars
to
his
choice
,
and
*NL*
re-established
him
completely
in
her
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
Lucy
's
behaviour
in
the
affair
,
and
the
prosperity
which
*NL*
crowned
it
,
therefore
,
may
be
held
forth
as
a
most
encouraging
instance
*NL*
of
what
an
earnest
,
an
unceasing
attention
to
self-interest
,
however
*NL*
its
progress
may
be
apparently
obstructed
,
will
do
in
securing
every
*NL*
advantage
of
fortune
,
with
no
other
sacrifice
than
that
of
time
and
*NL*
conscience
.
When
Robert
first
sought
her
acquaintance
,
and
privately
*NL*
visited
her
in
Bartlett
's
Buildings
,
it
was
only
with
the
view
imputed
*NL*
to
him
by
his
brother
.
He
merely
meant
to
persuade
her
to
give
up
the
*NL*
engagement
;
and
as
there
could
be
nothing
to
overcome
but
the
affection
*NL*
of
both
,
he
naturally
expected
that
one
or
two
interviews
would
settle
*NL*
the
matter
.
In
that
point
,
however
,
and
that
only
,
he
erred
;
--
for
*NL*
though
Lucy
soon
gave
him
hopes
that
his
eloquence
would
convince
her
*NL*
in
TIME
,
another
visit
,
another
conversation
,
was
always
wanted
to
*NL*
produce
this
conviction
.
Some
doubts
always
lingered
in
her
mind
when
*NL*
they
parted
,
which
could
only
be
removed
by
another
half
hour
's
*NL*
discourse
with
himself
.
His
attendance
was
by
this
means
secured
,
and
*NL*
the
rest
followed
in
course
.
Instead
of
talking
of
Edward
,
they
came
*NL*
gradually
to
talk
only
of
Robert
,
--
a
subject
on
which
he
had
always
*NL*
more
to
say
than
on
any
other
,
and
in
which
she
soon
betrayed
an
*NL*
interest
even
equal
to
his
own
;
and
in
short
,
it
became
speedily
*NL*
evident
to
both
,
that
he
had
entirely
supplanted
his
brother
.
He
was
*NL*
proud
of
his
conquest
,
proud
of
tricking
Edward
,
and
very
proud
of
*NL*
marrying
privately
without
his
mother
's
consent
.
What
immediately
*NL*
followed
is
known
.
They
passed
some
months
in
great
happiness
at
*NL*
Dawlish
;
for
she
had
many
relations
and
old
acquaintances
to
cut
--
and
*NL*
he
drew
several
plans
for
magnificent
cottages
;
--
and
from
thence
*NL*
returning
to
town
,
procured
the
forgiveness
of
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
by
the
*NL*
simple
expedient
of
asking
it
,
which
,
at
Lucy
's
instigation
,
was
*NL*
adopted
.
The
forgiveness
,
at
first
,
indeed
,
as
was
reasonable
,
*NL*
comprehended
only
Robert
;
and
Lucy
,
who
had
owed
his
mother
no
duty
and
*NL*
therefore
could
have
transgressed
none
,
still
remained
some
weeks
*NL*
longer
unpardoned
.
But
perseverance
in
humility
of
conduct
and
*NL*
messages
,
in
self-condemnation
for
Robert
's
offence
,
and
gratitude
for
*NL*
the
unkindness
she
was
treated
with
,
procured
her
in
time
the
haughty
*NL*
notice
which
overcame
her
by
its
graciousness
,
and
led
soon
afterwards
,
*NL*
by
rapid
degrees
,
to
the
highest
state
of
affection
and
influence
.
*NL*
Lucy
became
as
necessary
to
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
as
either
Robert
or
Fanny
;
*NL*
and
while
Edward
was
never
cordially
forgiven
for
having
once
intended
*NL*
to
marry
her
,
and
Elinor
,
though
superior
to
her
in
fortune
and
birth
,
*NL*
was
spoken
of
as
an
intruder
,
SHE
was
in
every
thing
considered
,
and
*NL*
always
openly
acknowledged
,
to
be
a
favourite
child
.
They
settled
in
*NL*
town
,
received
very
liberal
assistance
from
Mrs.
Ferrars
,
were
on
the
*NL*
best
terms
imaginable
with
the
Dashwoods
;
and
setting
aside
the
*NL*
jealousies
and
ill-will
continually
subsisting
between
Fanny
and
Lucy
,
*NL*
in
which
their
husbands
of
course
took
a
part
,
as
well
as
the
frequent
*NL*
domestic
disagreements
between
Robert
and
Lucy
themselves
,
nothing
*NL*
could
exceed
the
harmony
in
which
they
all
lived
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Edward
had
done
to
forfeit
the
right
of
eldest
son
,
might
have
*NL*
puzzled
many
people
to
find
out
;
and
what
Robert
had
done
to
succeed
to
*NL*
it
,
might
have
puzzled
them
still
more
.
It
was
an
arrangement
,
*NL*
however
,
justified
in
its
effects
,
if
not
in
its
cause
;
for
nothing
*NL*
ever
appeared
in
Robert
's
style
of
living
or
of
talking
to
give
a
*NL*
suspicion
of
his
regretting
the
extent
of
his
income
,
as
either
leaving
*NL*
his
brother
too
little
,
or
bringing
himself
too
much
;
--
and
if
Edward
*NL*
might
be
judged
from
the
ready
discharge
of
his
duties
in
every
*NL*
particular
,
from
an
increasing
attachment
to
his
wife
and
his
home
,
and
*NL*
from
the
regular
cheerfulness
of
his
spirits
,
he
might
be
supposed
no
*NL*
less
contented
with
his
lot
,
no
less
free
from
every
wish
of
an
*NL*
exchange
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elinor
's
marriage
divided
her
as
little
from
her
family
as
could
well
*NL*
be
contrived
,
without
rendering
the
cottage
at
Barton
entirely
useless
,
*NL*
for
her
mother
and
sisters
spent
much
more
than
half
their
time
with
*NL*
her
.
Mrs.
Dashwood
was
acting
on
motives
of
policy
as
well
as
pleasure
*NL*
in
the
frequency
of
her
visits
at
Delaford
;
for
her
wish
of
bringing
*NL*
Marianne
and
Colonel
Brandon
together
was
hardly
less
earnest
,
though
*NL*
rather
more
liberal
than
what
John
had
expressed
.
It
was
now
her
*NL*
darling
object
.
Precious
as
was
the
company
of
her
daughter
to
her
,
*NL*
she
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
give
up
its
constant
enjoyment
to
her
*NL*
valued
friend
;
and
to
see
Marianne
settled
at
the
mansion-house
was
*NL*
equally
the
wish
of
Edward
and
Elinor
.
They
each
felt
his
sorrows
,
and
*NL*
their
own
obligations
,
and
Marianne
,
by
general
consent
,
was
to
be
the
*NL*
reward
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
a
confederacy
against
her
--
with
a
knowledge
so
intimate
of
*NL*
his
goodness
--
with
a
conviction
of
his
fond
attachment
to
herself
,
*NL*
which
at
last
,
though
long
after
it
was
observable
to
everybody
*NL*
else
--
burst
on
her
--
what
could
she
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
Marianne
Dashwood
was
born
to
an
extraordinary
fate
.
She
was
born
to
*NL*
discover
the
falsehood
of
her
own
opinions
,
and
to
counteract
,
by
her
*NL*
conduct
,
her
most
favourite
maxims
.
She
was
born
to
overcome
an
*NL*
affection
formed
so
late
in
life
as
at
seventeen
,
and
with
no
sentiment
*NL*
superior
to
strong
esteem
and
lively
friendship
,
voluntarily
to
give
*NL*
her
hand
to
another
!
--
and
THAT
other
,
a
man
who
had
suffered
no
less
*NL*
than
herself
under
the
event
of
a
former
attachment
,
whom
,
two
years
*NL*
before
,
she
had
considered
too
old
to
be
married
,
--
and
who
still
sought
*NL*
the
constitutional
safeguard
of
a
flannel
waistcoat
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
so
it
was
.
Instead
of
falling
a
sacrifice
to
an
irresistible
*NL*
passion
,
as
once
she
had
fondly
flattered
herself
with
expecting
,
--
instead
*NL*
of
remaining
even
for
ever
with
her
mother
,
and
finding
her
only
*NL*
pleasures
in
retirement
and
study
,
as
afterwards
in
her
more
calm
and
*NL*
sober
judgment
she
had
determined
on
,
--
she
found
herself
at
nineteen
,
*NL*
submitting
to
new
attachments
,
entering
on
new
duties
,
placed
in
a
new
*NL*
home
,
a
wife
,
the
mistress
of
a
family
,
and
the
patroness
of
a
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Brandon
was
now
as
happy
,
as
all
those
who
best
loved
him
,
*NL*
believed
he
deserved
to
be
;
--
in
Marianne
he
was
consoled
for
every
past
*NL*
affliction
;
--
her
regard
and
her
society
restored
his
mind
to
animation
,
*NL*
and
his
spirits
to
cheerfulness
;
and
that
Marianne
found
her
own
*NL*
happiness
in
forming
his
,
was
equally
the
persuasion
and
delight
of
*NL*
each
observing
friend
.
Marianne
could
never
love
by
halves
;
and
her
*NL*
whole
heart
became
,
in
time
,
as
much
devoted
to
her
husband
,
as
it
had
*NL*
once
been
to
Willoughby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Willoughby
could
not
hear
of
her
marriage
without
a
pang
;
and
his
*NL*
punishment
was
soon
afterwards
complete
in
the
voluntary
forgiveness
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Smith
,
who
,
by
stating
his
marriage
with
a
woman
of
character
,
as
*NL*
the
source
of
her
clemency
,
gave
him
reason
for
believing
that
had
he
*NL*
behaved
with
honour
towards
Marianne
,
he
might
at
once
have
been
happy
*NL*
and
rich
.
That
his
repentance
of
misconduct
,
which
thus
brought
its
*NL*
own
punishment
,
was
sincere
,
need
not
be
doubted
;
--
nor
that
he
long
*NL*
thought
of
Colonel
Brandon
with
envy
,
and
of
Marianne
with
regret
.
But
*NL*
that
he
was
for
ever
inconsolable
,
that
he
fled
from
society
,
or
*NL*
contracted
an
habitual
gloom
of
temper
,
or
died
of
a
broken
heart
,
must
*NL*
not
be
depended
on
--
for
he
did
neither
.
He
lived
to
exert
,
and
*NL*
frequently
to
enjoy
himself
.
His
wife
was
not
always
out
of
humour
,
*NL*
nor
his
home
always
uncomfortable
;
and
in
his
breed
of
horses
and
dogs
,
*NL*
and
in
sporting
of
every
kind
,
he
found
no
inconsiderable
degree
of
*NL*
domestic
felicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Marianne
,
however
--
in
spite
of
his
incivility
in
surviving
her
*NL*
loss
--
he
always
retained
that
decided
regard
which
interested
him
in
*NL*
every
thing
that
befell
her
,
and
made
her
his
secret
standard
of
*NL*
perfection
in
woman
;
--
and
many
a
rising
beauty
would
be
slighted
by
him
*NL*
in
after-days
as
bearing
no
comparison
with
Mrs.
Brandon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dashwood
was
prudent
enough
to
remain
at
the
cottage
,
without
*NL*
attempting
a
removal
to
Delaford
;
and
fortunately
for
Sir
John
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Jennings
,
when
Marianne
was
taken
from
them
,
Margaret
had
reached
an
*NL*
age
highly
suitable
for
dancing
,
and
not
very
ineligible
for
being
*NL*
supposed
to
have
a
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
Barton
and
Delaford
,
there
was
that
constant
communication
*NL*
which
strong
family
affection
would
naturally
dictate
;
--
and
among
the
*NL*
merits
and
the
happiness
of
Elinor
and
Marianne
,
let
it
not
be
ranked
*NL*
as
the
least
considerable
,
that
though
sisters
,
and
living
almost
*NL*
within
sight
of
each
other
,
they
could
live
without
disagreement
*NL*
between
themselves
,
or
producing
coolness
between
their
husbands
.
