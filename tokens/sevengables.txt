THE
HOUSE
OF
THE
SEVEN
GABLES
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IN
September
of
the
year
during
the
February
of
which
Hawthorne
had
*NL*
completed
``
The
Scarlet
Letter
,
''
he
began
``
The
House
of
the
Seven
*NL*
Gables
.
''
Meanwhile
,
he
had
removed
from
Salem
to
Lenox
,
in
Berkshire
*NL*
County
,
Massachusetts
,
where
he
occupied
with
his
family
a
small
red
*NL*
wooden
house
,
still
standing
at
the
date
of
this
edition
,
near
the
*NL*
Stockbridge
Bowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
'n'
t
have
the
new
story
ready
by
November
,
''
he
explained
to
his
*NL*
publisher
,
on
the
1st
of
October
,
``
for
I
am
never
good
for
anything
in
*NL*
the
literary
way
till
after
the
first
autumnal
frost
,
which
has
*NL*
somewhat
such
an
effect
on
my
imagination
that
it
does
on
the
foliage
*NL*
here
about
me-multiplying
and
brightening
its
hues
.
''
But
by
vigorous
*NL*
application
he
was
able
to
complete
the
new
work
about
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
January
following
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
research
has
disclosed
the
manner
in
which
the
romance
is
*NL*
interwoven
with
incidents
from
the
history
of
the
Hawthorne
family
,
*NL*
``
The
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
''
has
acquired
an
interest
apart
from
*NL*
that
by
which
it
first
appealed
to
the
public
.
John
Hathorne
-LRB-
as
the
*NL*
name
was
then
spelled
-RRB-
,
the
great-grandfather
of
Nathaniel
Hawthorne
,
*NL*
was
a
magistrate
at
Salem
in
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
*NL*
century
,
and
officiated
at
the
famous
trials
for
witchcraft
held
there
.
*NL*
It
is
of
record
that
he
used
peculiar
severity
towards
a
certain
woman
*NL*
who
was
among
the
accused
;
and
the
husband
of
this
woman
prophesied
*NL*
that
God
would
take
revenge
upon
his
wife
's
persecutors
.
This
*NL*
circumstance
doubtless
furnished
a
hint
for
that
piece
of
tradition
in
*NL*
the
book
which
represents
a
Pyncheon
of
a
former
generation
as
having
*NL*
persecuted
one
Maule
,
who
declared
that
God
would
give
his
enemy
``
blood
*NL*
to
drink
.
''
It
became
a
conviction
with
the
Hawthorne
family
that
a
*NL*
curse
had
been
pronounced
upon
its
members
,
which
continued
in
force
in
*NL*
the
time
of
the
romancer
;
a
conviction
perhaps
derived
from
the
*NL*
recorded
prophecy
of
the
injured
woman
's
husband
,
just
mentioned
;
and
,
*NL*
here
again
,
we
have
a
correspondence
with
Maule
's
malediction
in
the
*NL*
story
.
Furthermore
,
there
occurs
in
the
``
American
Note-Books
''
-LRB-
August
*NL*
27
,
1837
-RRB-
,
a
reminiscence
of
the
author
's
family
,
to
the
following
*NL*
effect
.
Philip
English
,
a
character
well-known
in
early
Salem
annals
,
*NL*
was
among
those
who
suffered
from
John
Hathorne
's
magisterial
*NL*
harshness
,
and
he
maintained
in
consequence
a
lasting
feud
with
the
old
*NL*
Puritan
official
.
But
at
his
death
English
left
daughters
,
one
of
whom
*NL*
is
said
to
have
married
the
son
of
Justice
John
Hathorne
,
whom
English
*NL*
had
declared
he
would
never
forgive
.
It
is
scarcely
necessary
to
point
*NL*
out
how
clearly
this
foreshadows
the
final
union
of
those
hereditary
*NL*
foes
,
the
Pyncheons
and
Maules
,
through
the
marriage
of
Phoebe
and
*NL*
Holgrave
.
The
romance
,
however
,
describes
the
Maules
as
possessing
some
*NL*
of
the
traits
known
to
have
been
characteristic
of
the
Hawthornes
:
for
*NL*
example
,
``
so
long
as
any
of
the
race
were
to
be
found
,
they
had
been
*NL*
marked
out
from
other
men
--
not
strikingly
,
nor
as
with
a
sharp
line
,
*NL*
but
with
an
effect
that
was
felt
rather
than
spoken
of
--
by
an
*NL*
hereditary
characteristic
of
reserve
.
''
Thus
,
while
the
general
*NL*
suggestion
of
the
Hawthorne
line
and
its
fortunes
was
followed
in
the
*NL*
romance
,
the
Pyncheons
taking
the
place
of
the
author
's
family
,
certain
*NL*
distinguishing
marks
of
the
Hawthornes
were
assigned
to
the
imaginary
*NL*
Maule
posterity
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
one
or
two
other
points
which
indicate
Hawthorne
's
method
of
*NL*
basing
his
compositions
,
the
result
in
the
main
of
pure
invention
,
on
*NL*
the
solid
ground
of
particular
facts
.
Allusion
is
made
,
in
the
first
*NL*
chapter
of
the
``
Seven
Gables
,
''
to
a
grant
of
lands
in
Waldo
County
,
*NL*
Maine
,
owned
by
the
Pyncheon
family
.
In
the
``
American
Note-Books
''
*NL*
there
is
an
entry
,
dated
August
12
,
1837
,
which
speaks
of
the
*NL*
Revolutionary
general
,
Knox
,
and
his
land-grant
in
Waldo
County
,
by
*NL*
virtue
of
which
the
owner
had
hoped
to
establish
an
estate
on
the
*NL*
English
plan
,
with
a
tenantry
to
make
it
profitable
for
him
.
An
*NL*
incident
of
much
greater
importance
in
the
story
is
the
supposed
murder
*NL*
of
one
of
the
Pyncheons
by
his
nephew
,
to
whom
we
are
introduced
as
*NL*
Clifford
Pyncheon
.
In
all
probability
Hawthorne
connected
with
this
,
*NL*
in
his
mind
,
the
murder
of
Mr.
White
,
a
wealthy
gentleman
of
Salem
,
*NL*
killed
by
a
man
whom
his
nephew
had
hired
.
This
took
place
a
few
years
*NL*
after
Hawthorne
's
graduation
from
college
,
and
was
one
of
the
*NL*
celebrated
cases
of
the
day
,
Daniel
Webster
taking
part
prominently
in
*NL*
the
trial
.
But
it
should
be
observed
here
that
such
resemblances
as
*NL*
these
between
sundry
elements
in
the
work
of
Hawthorne
's
fancy
and
*NL*
details
of
reality
are
only
fragmentary
,
and
are
rearranged
to
suit
the
*NL*
author
's
purposes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
way
he
has
made
his
description
of
Hepzibah
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
seven-gabled
mansion
conform
so
nearly
to
several
old
dwellings
*NL*
formerly
or
still
extant
in
Salem
,
that
strenuous
efforts
have
been
*NL*
made
to
fix
upon
some
one
of
them
as
the
veritable
edifice
of
the
*NL*
romance
.
A
paragraph
in
the
opening
chapter
has
perhaps
assisted
this
*NL*
delusion
that
there
must
have
been
a
single
original
House
of
the
Seven
*NL*
Gables
,
framed
by
flesh-and-blood
carpenters
;
for
it
runs
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Familiar
as
it
stands
in
the
writer
's
recollection
--
for
it
has
been
an
*NL*
object
of
curiosity
with
him
from
boyhood
,
both
as
a
specimen
of
the
*NL*
best
and
stateliest
architecture
of
a
long-past
epoch
,
and
as
the
scene
*NL*
of
events
more
full
of
interest
perhaps
than
those
of
a
gray
feudal
*NL*
castle
--
familiar
as
it
stands
,
in
its
rusty
old
age
,
it
is
therefore
*NL*
only
the
more
difficult
to
imagine
the
bright
novelty
with
which
it
*NL*
first
caught
the
sunshine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hundreds
of
pilgrims
annually
visit
a
house
in
Salem
,
belonging
to
one
*NL*
branch
of
the
Ingersoll
family
of
that
place
,
which
is
stoutly
*NL*
maintained
to
have
been
the
model
for
Hawthorne
's
visionary
dwelling
.
*NL*
Others
have
supposed
that
the
now
vanished
house
of
the
identical
*NL*
Philip
English
,
whose
blood
,
as
we
have
already
noticed
,
became
mingled
*NL*
with
that
of
the
Hawthornes
,
supplied
the
pattern
;
and
still
a
third
*NL*
building
,
known
as
the
Curwen
mansion
,
has
been
declared
the
only
*NL*
genuine
establishment
.
Notwithstanding
persistent
popular
belief
,
the
*NL*
authenticity
of
all
these
must
positively
be
denied
;
although
it
is
*NL*
possible
that
isolated
reminiscences
of
all
three
may
have
blended
with
*NL*
the
ideal
image
in
the
mind
of
Hawthorne
.
He
,
it
will
be
seen
,
remarks
*NL*
in
the
Preface
,
alluding
to
himself
in
the
third
person
,
that
he
trusts
*NL*
not
to
be
condemned
for
``
laying
out
a
street
that
infringes
upon
*NL*
nobody
's
private
rights
...
and
building
a
house
of
materials
long
in
*NL*
use
for
constructing
castles
in
the
air
.
''
More
than
this
,
he
stated
to
*NL*
persons
still
living
that
the
house
of
the
romance
was
not
copied
from
*NL*
any
actual
edifice
,
but
was
simply
a
general
reproduction
of
a
style
of
*NL*
architecture
belonging
to
colonial
days
,
examples
of
which
survived
*NL*
into
the
period
of
his
youth
,
but
have
since
been
radically
modified
or
*NL*
destroyed
.
Here
,
as
elsewhere
,
he
exercised
the
liberty
of
a
creative
*NL*
mind
to
heighten
the
probability
of
his
pictures
without
confining
*NL*
himself
to
a
literal
description
of
something
he
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Hawthorne
remained
at
Lenox
,
and
during
the
composition
of
this
*NL*
romance
,
various
other
literary
personages
settled
or
stayed
for
a
time
*NL*
in
the
vicinity
;
among
them
,
Herman
Melville
,
whose
intercourse
*NL*
Hawthorne
greatly
enjoyed
,
Henry
James
,
Sr.
,
Doctor
Holmes
,
J.
T.
*NL*
Headley
,
James
Russell
Lowell
,
Edwin
P.
Whipple
,
Frederika
Bremer
,
and
*NL*
J.
T.
Fields
;
so
that
there
was
no
lack
of
intellectual
society
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
the
beautiful
and
inspiring
mountain
scenery
of
the
place
.
*NL*
``
In
the
afternoons
,
nowadays
,
''
he
records
,
shortly
before
beginning
the
*NL*
work
,
``
this
valley
in
which
I
dwell
seems
like
a
vast
basin
filled
with
*NL*
golden
Sunshine
as
with
wine
;
''
and
,
happy
in
the
companionship
of
his
*NL*
wife
and
their
three
children
,
he
led
a
simple
,
refined
,
idyllic
life
,
*NL*
despite
the
restrictions
of
a
scanty
and
uncertain
income
.
A
letter
*NL*
written
by
Mrs.
Hawthorne
,
at
this
time
,
to
a
member
of
her
family
,
*NL*
gives
incidentally
a
glimpse
of
the
scene
,
which
may
properly
find
a
*NL*
place
here
.
She
says
:
``
I
delight
to
think
that
you
also
can
look
*NL*
forth
,
as
I
do
now
,
upon
a
broad
valley
and
a
fine
amphitheater
of
*NL*
hills
,
and
are
about
to
watch
the
stately
ceremony
of
the
sunset
from
*NL*
your
piazza
.
But
you
have
not
this
lovely
lake
,
nor
,
I
suppose
,
the
*NL*
delicate
purple
mist
which
folds
these
slumbering
mountains
in
airy
*NL*
veils
.
Mr.
Hawthorne
has
been
lying
down
in
the
sun
shine
,
slightly
*NL*
fleckered
with
the
shadows
of
a
tree
,
and
Una
and
Julian
have
been
*NL*
making
him
look
like
the
mighty
Pan
,
by
covering
his
chin
and
breast
*NL*
with
long
grass-blades
,
that
looked
like
a
verdant
and
venerable
*NL*
beard
.
''
The
pleasantness
and
peace
of
his
surroundings
and
of
his
*NL*
modest
home
,
in
Lenox
,
may
be
taken
into
account
as
harmonizing
with
*NL*
the
mellow
serenity
of
the
romance
then
produced
.
Of
the
work
,
when
it
*NL*
appeared
in
the
early
spring
of
1851
,
he
wrote
to
Horatio
Bridge
these
*NL*
words
,
now
published
for
the
first
time
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
'
in
my
opinion
,
is
better
than
`
The
*NL*
Scarlet
Letter
:
'
but
I
should
not
wonder
if
I
had
refined
upon
the
*NL*
principal
character
a
little
too
much
for
popular
appreciation
,
nor
if
*NL*
the
romance
of
the
book
should
be
somewhat
at
odds
with
the
humble
and
*NL*
familiar
scenery
in
which
I
invest
it
.
But
I
feel
that
portions
of
it
*NL*
are
as
good
as
anything
I
can
hope
to
write
,
and
the
publisher
speaks
*NL*
encouragingly
of
its
success
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
England
,
especially
,
came
many
warm
expressions
of
praise
,
--
a
fact
*NL*
which
Mrs.
Hawthorne
,
in
a
private
letter
,
commented
on
as
the
*NL*
fulfillment
of
a
possibility
which
Hawthorne
,
writing
in
boyhood
to
his
*NL*
mother
,
had
looked
forward
to
.
He
had
asked
her
if
she
would
not
like
*NL*
him
to
become
an
author
and
have
his
books
read
in
England
.

PREFACE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
a
writer
calls
his
work
a
Romance
,
it
need
hardly
be
observed
that
*NL*
he
wishes
to
claim
a
certain
latitude
,
both
as
to
its
fashion
and
*NL*
material
,
which
he
would
not
have
felt
himself
entitled
to
assume
had
*NL*
he
professed
to
be
writing
a
Novel
.
The
latter
form
of
composition
is
*NL*
presumed
to
aim
at
a
very
minute
fidelity
,
not
merely
to
the
possible
,
*NL*
but
to
the
probable
and
ordinary
course
of
man
's
experience
.
The
*NL*
former
--
while
,
as
a
work
of
art
,
it
must
rigidly
subject
itself
to
*NL*
laws
,
and
while
it
sins
unpardonably
so
far
as
it
may
swerve
aside
from
*NL*
the
truth
of
the
human
heart
--
has
fairly
a
right
to
present
that
truth
*NL*
under
circumstances
,
to
a
great
extent
,
of
the
writer
's
own
choosing
or
*NL*
creation
.
If
he
think
fit
,
also
,
he
may
so
manage
his
atmospherical
*NL*
medium
as
to
bring
out
or
mellow
the
lights
and
deepen
and
enrich
the
*NL*
shadows
of
the
picture
.
He
will
be
wise
,
no
doubt
,
to
make
a
very
*NL*
moderate
use
of
the
privileges
here
stated
,
and
,
especially
,
to
mingle
*NL*
the
Marvelous
rather
as
a
slight
,
delicate
,
and
evanescent
flavor
,
than
*NL*
as
any
portion
of
the
actual
substance
of
the
dish
offered
to
the
*NL*
public
.
He
can
hardly
be
said
,
however
,
to
commit
a
literary
crime
*NL*
even
if
he
disregard
this
caution
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
present
work
,
the
author
has
proposed
to
himself
--
but
with
what
*NL*
success
,
fortunately
,
it
is
not
for
him
to
judge
--
to
keep
undeviatingly
*NL*
within
his
immunities
.
The
point
of
view
in
which
this
tale
comes
*NL*
under
the
Romantic
definition
lies
in
the
attempt
to
connect
a
bygone
*NL*
time
with
the
very
present
that
is
flitting
away
from
us
.
It
is
a
*NL*
legend
prolonging
itself
,
from
an
epoch
now
gray
in
the
distance
,
down
*NL*
into
our
own
broad
daylight
,
and
bringing
along
with
it
some
of
its
*NL*
legendary
mist
,
which
the
reader
,
according
to
his
pleasure
,
may
either
*NL*
disregard
,
or
allow
it
to
float
almost
imperceptibly
about
the
*NL*
characters
and
events
for
the
sake
of
a
picturesque
effect
.
The
*NL*
narrative
,
it
may
be
,
is
woven
of
so
humble
a
texture
as
to
require
*NL*
this
advantage
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
to
render
it
the
more
difficult
*NL*
of
attainment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
writers
lay
very
great
stress
upon
some
definite
moral
purpose
,
at
*NL*
which
they
profess
to
aim
their
works
.
Not
to
be
deficient
in
this
*NL*
particular
,
the
author
has
provided
himself
with
a
moral
,
--
the
truth
,
*NL*
namely
,
that
the
wrong-doing
of
one
generation
lives
into
the
*NL*
successive
ones
,
and
,
divesting
itself
of
every
temporary
advantage
,
*NL*
becomes
a
pure
and
uncontrollable
mischief
;
and
he
would
feel
it
a
*NL*
singular
gratification
if
this
romance
might
effectually
convince
*NL*
mankind
--
or
,
indeed
,
any
one
man
--
of
the
folly
of
tumbling
down
an
*NL*
avalanche
of
ill-gotten
gold
,
or
real
estate
,
on
the
heads
of
an
*NL*
unfortunate
posterity
,
thereby
to
maim
and
crush
them
,
until
the
*NL*
accumulated
mass
shall
be
scattered
abroad
in
its
original
atoms
.
In
*NL*
good
faith
,
however
,
he
is
not
sufficiently
imaginative
to
flatter
*NL*
himself
with
the
slightest
hope
of
this
kind
.
When
romances
do
really
*NL*
teach
anything
,
or
produce
any
effective
operation
,
it
is
usually
*NL*
through
a
far
more
subtile
process
than
the
ostensible
one
.
The
author
*NL*
has
considered
it
hardly
worth
his
while
,
therefore
,
relentlessly
to
*NL*
impale
the
story
with
its
moral
as
with
an
iron
rod
,
--
or
,
rather
,
as
by
*NL*
sticking
a
pin
through
a
butterfly
,
--
thus
at
once
depriving
it
of
life
,
*NL*
and
causing
it
to
stiffen
in
an
ungainly
and
unnatural
attitude
.
A
*NL*
high
truth
,
indeed
,
fairly
,
finely
,
and
skilfully
wrought
out
,
*NL*
brightening
at
every
step
,
and
crowning
the
final
development
of
a
work
*NL*
of
fiction
,
may
add
an
artistic
glory
,
but
is
never
any
truer
,
and
*NL*
seldom
any
more
evident
,
at
the
last
page
than
at
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
perhaps
choose
to
assign
an
actual
locality
to
the
*NL*
imaginary
events
of
this
narrative
.
If
permitted
by
the
historical
*NL*
connection
,
--
which
,
though
slight
,
was
essential
to
his
plan
,
--
the
*NL*
author
would
very
willingly
have
avoided
anything
of
this
nature
.
Not
*NL*
to
speak
of
other
objections
,
it
exposes
the
romance
to
an
inflexible
*NL*
and
exceedingly
dangerous
species
of
criticism
,
by
bringing
his
*NL*
fancy-pictures
almost
into
positive
contact
with
the
realities
of
the
*NL*
moment
.
It
has
been
no
part
of
his
object
,
however
,
to
describe
local
*NL*
manners
,
nor
in
any
way
to
meddle
with
the
characteristics
of
a
*NL*
community
for
whom
he
cherishes
a
proper
respect
and
a
natural
regard
.
*NL*
He
trusts
not
to
be
considered
as
unpardonably
offending
by
laying
out
*NL*
a
street
that
infringes
upon
nobody
's
private
rights
,
and
appropriating
*NL*
a
lot
of
land
which
had
no
visible
owner
,
and
building
a
house
of
*NL*
materials
long
in
use
for
constructing
castles
in
the
air
.
The
*NL*
personages
of
the
tale
--
though
they
give
themselves
out
to
be
of
*NL*
ancient
stability
and
considerable
prominence
--
are
really
of
the
*NL*
author
's
own
making
,
or
at
all
events
,
of
his
own
mixing
;
their
virtues
*NL*
can
shed
no
lustre
,
nor
their
defects
redound
,
in
the
remotest
degree
,
*NL*
to
the
discredit
of
the
venerable
town
of
which
they
profess
to
be
*NL*
inhabitants
.
He
would
be
glad
,
therefore
,
if-especially
in
the
quarter
*NL*
to
which
he
alludes-the
book
may
be
read
strictly
as
a
Romance
,
having
*NL*
a
great
deal
more
to
do
with
the
clouds
overhead
than
with
any
portion
*NL*
of
the
actual
soil
of
the
County
of
Essex
.

THE
HOUSE
OF
SEVEN
GABLES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
by
*NL*
*NL*
Nathaniel
Hawthorne
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
The
Old
Pyncheon
Family
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HALFWAY
down
a
by-street
of
one
of
our
New
England
towns
stands
a
rusty
*NL*
wooden
house
,
with
seven
acutely
peaked
gables
,
facing
towards
various
*NL*
points
of
the
compass
,
and
a
huge
,
clustered
chimney
in
the
midst
.
The
*NL*
street
is
Pyncheon
Street
;
the
house
is
the
old
Pyncheon
House
;
and
an
*NL*
elm-tree
,
of
wide
circumference
,
rooted
before
the
door
,
is
familiar
to
*NL*
every
town-born
child
by
the
title
of
the
Pyncheon
Elm
.
On
my
*NL*
occasional
visits
to
the
town
aforesaid
,
I
seldom
failed
to
turn
down
*NL*
Pyncheon
Street
,
for
the
sake
of
passing
through
the
shadow
of
these
*NL*
two
antiquities
,
--
the
great
elm-tree
and
the
weather-beaten
edifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
aspect
of
the
venerable
mansion
has
always
affected
me
like
a
human
*NL*
countenance
,
bearing
the
traces
not
merely
of
outward
storm
and
*NL*
sunshine
,
but
expressive
also
,
of
the
long
lapse
of
mortal
life
,
and
*NL*
accompanying
vicissitudes
that
have
passed
within
.
Were
these
to
be
*NL*
worthily
recounted
,
they
would
form
a
narrative
of
no
small
interest
*NL*
and
instruction
,
and
possessing
,
moreover
,
a
certain
remarkable
unity
,
*NL*
which
might
almost
seem
the
result
of
artistic
arrangement
.
But
the
*NL*
story
would
include
a
chain
of
events
extending
over
the
better
part
of
*NL*
two
centuries
,
and
,
written
out
with
reasonable
amplitude
,
would
fill
a
*NL*
bigger
folio
volume
,
or
a
longer
series
of
duodecimos
,
than
could
*NL*
prudently
be
appropriated
to
the
annals
of
all
New
England
during
a
*NL*
similar
period
.
It
consequently
becomes
imperative
to
make
short
work
*NL*
with
most
of
the
traditionary
lore
of
which
the
old
Pyncheon
House
,
*NL*
otherwise
known
as
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
has
been
the
theme
.
*NL*
With
a
brief
sketch
,
therefore
,
of
the
circumstances
amid
which
the
*NL*
foundation
of
the
house
was
laid
,
and
a
rapid
glimpse
at
its
quaint
*NL*
exterior
,
as
it
grew
black
in
the
prevalent
east
wind
,
--
pointing
,
too
,
*NL*
here
and
there
,
at
some
spot
of
more
verdant
mossiness
on
its
roof
and
*NL*
walls
,
--
we
shall
commence
the
real
action
of
our
tale
at
an
epoch
not
*NL*
very
remote
from
the
present
day
.
Still
,
there
will
be
a
connection
*NL*
with
the
long
past
--
a
reference
to
forgotten
events
and
personages
,
and
*NL*
to
manners
,
feelings
,
and
opinions
,
almost
or
wholly
obsolete
--
which
,
*NL*
if
adequately
translated
to
the
reader
,
would
serve
to
illustrate
how
*NL*
much
of
old
material
goes
to
make
up
the
freshest
novelty
of
human
*NL*
life
.
Hence
,
too
,
might
be
drawn
a
weighty
lesson
from
the
*NL*
little-regarded
truth
,
that
the
act
of
the
passing
generation
is
the
*NL*
germ
which
may
and
must
produce
good
or
evil
fruit
in
a
far-distant
*NL*
time
;
that
,
together
with
the
seed
of
the
merely
temporary
crop
,
which
*NL*
mortals
term
expediency
,
they
inevitably
sow
the
acorns
of
a
more
*NL*
enduring
growth
,
which
may
darkly
overshadow
their
posterity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
antique
as
it
now
looks
,
was
not
the
*NL*
first
habitation
erected
by
civilized
man
on
precisely
the
same
spot
of
*NL*
ground
.
Pyncheon
Street
formerly
bore
the
humbler
appellation
of
*NL*
Maule
's
Lane
,
from
the
name
of
the
original
occupant
of
the
soil
,
*NL*
before
whose
cottage-door
it
was
a
cow-path
.
A
natural
spring
of
soft
*NL*
and
pleasant
water
--
a
rare
treasure
on
the
sea-girt
peninsula
where
the
*NL*
Puritan
settlement
was
made
--
had
early
induced
Matthew
Maule
to
build
a
*NL*
hut
,
shaggy
with
thatch
,
at
this
point
,
although
somewhat
too
remote
*NL*
from
what
was
then
the
centre
of
the
village
.
In
the
growth
of
the
*NL*
town
,
however
,
after
some
thirty
or
forty
years
,
the
site
covered
by
*NL*
this
rude
hovel
had
become
exceedingly
desirable
in
the
eyes
of
a
*NL*
prominent
and
powerful
personage
,
who
asserted
plausible
claims
to
the
*NL*
proprietorship
of
this
and
a
large
adjacent
tract
of
land
,
on
the
*NL*
strength
of
a
grant
from
the
legislature
.
Colonel
Pyncheon
,
the
*NL*
claimant
,
as
we
gather
from
whatever
traits
of
him
are
preserved
,
was
*NL*
characterized
by
an
iron
energy
of
purpose
.
Matthew
Maule
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
though
an
obscure
man
,
was
stubborn
in
the
defence
of
what
*NL*
he
considered
his
right
;
and
,
for
several
years
,
he
succeeded
in
*NL*
protecting
the
acre
or
two
of
earth
which
,
with
his
own
toil
,
he
had
*NL*
hewn
out
of
the
primeval
forest
,
to
be
his
garden
ground
and
homestead
.
*NL*
No
written
record
of
this
dispute
is
known
to
be
in
existence
.
Our
*NL*
acquaintance
with
the
whole
subject
is
derived
chiefly
from
tradition
.
*NL*
It
would
be
bold
,
therefore
,
and
possibly
unjust
,
to
venture
a
decisive
*NL*
opinion
as
to
its
merits
;
although
it
appears
to
have
been
at
least
a
*NL*
matter
of
doubt
,
whether
Colonel
Pyncheon
's
claim
were
not
unduly
*NL*
stretched
,
in
order
to
make
it
cover
the
small
metes
and
bounds
of
*NL*
Matthew
Maule
.
What
greatly
strengthens
such
a
suspicion
is
the
fact
*NL*
that
this
controversy
between
two
ill-matched
antagonists
--
at
a
period
,
*NL*
moreover
,
laud
it
as
we
may
,
when
personal
influence
had
far
more
*NL*
weight
than
now
--
remained
for
years
undecided
,
and
came
to
a
close
only
*NL*
with
the
death
of
the
party
occupying
the
disputed
soil
.
The
mode
of
*NL*
his
death
,
too
,
affects
the
mind
differently
,
in
our
day
,
from
what
it
*NL*
did
a
century
and
a
half
ago
.
It
was
a
death
that
blasted
with
strange
*NL*
horror
the
humble
name
of
the
dweller
in
the
cottage
,
and
made
it
seem
*NL*
almost
a
religious
act
to
drive
the
plough
over
the
little
area
of
his
*NL*
habitation
,
and
obliterate
his
place
and
memory
from
among
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Matthew
Maule
,
in
a
word
,
was
executed
for
the
crime
of
witchcraft
.
*NL*
He
was
one
of
the
martyrs
to
that
terrible
delusion
,
which
should
teach
*NL*
us
,
among
its
other
morals
,
that
the
influential
classes
,
and
those
who
*NL*
take
upon
themselves
to
be
leaders
of
the
people
,
are
fully
liable
to
*NL*
all
the
passionate
error
that
has
ever
characterized
the
maddest
mob
.
*NL*
Clergymen
,
judges
,
statesmen
,
--
the
wisest
,
calmest
,
holiest
persons
of
*NL*
their
day
stood
in
the
inner
circle
round
about
the
gallows
,
loudest
to
*NL*
applaud
the
work
of
blood
,
latest
to
confess
themselves
miserably
*NL*
deceived
.
If
any
one
part
of
their
proceedings
can
be
said
to
deserve
*NL*
less
blame
than
another
,
it
was
the
singular
indiscrimination
with
*NL*
which
they
persecuted
,
not
merely
the
poor
and
aged
,
as
in
former
*NL*
judicial
massacres
,
but
people
of
all
ranks
;
their
own
equals
,
*NL*
brethren
,
and
wives
.
Amid
the
disorder
of
such
various
ruin
,
it
is
not
*NL*
strange
that
a
man
of
inconsiderable
note
,
like
Maule
,
should
have
*NL*
trodden
the
martyr
's
path
to
the
hill
of
execution
almost
unremarked
in
*NL*
the
throng
of
his
fellow
sufferers
.
But
,
in
after
days
,
when
the
*NL*
frenzy
of
that
hideous
epoch
had
subsided
,
it
was
remembered
how
loudly
*NL*
Colonel
Pyncheon
had
joined
in
the
general
cry
,
to
purge
the
land
from
*NL*
witchcraft
;
nor
did
it
fail
to
be
whispered
,
that
there
was
an
*NL*
invidious
acrimony
in
the
zeal
with
which
he
had
sought
the
*NL*
condemnation
of
Matthew
Maule
.
It
was
well
known
that
the
victim
had
*NL*
recognized
the
bitterness
of
personal
enmity
in
his
persecutor
's
*NL*
conduct
towards
him
,
and
that
he
declared
himself
hunted
to
death
for
*NL*
his
spoil
.
At
the
moment
of
execution
--
with
the
halter
about
his
neck
,
*NL*
and
while
Colonel
Pyncheon
sat
on
horseback
,
grimly
gazing
at
the
scene
*NL*
Maule
had
addressed
him
from
the
scaffold
,
and
uttered
a
prophecy
,
of
*NL*
which
history
,
as
well
as
fireside
tradition
,
has
preserved
the
very
*NL*
words
.
``
God
,
''
said
the
dying
man
,
pointing
his
finger
,
with
a
ghastly
*NL*
look
,
at
the
undismayed
countenance
of
his
enemy
,
--
``
God
will
give
him
*NL*
blood
to
drink
!
''
After
the
reputed
wizard
's
death
,
his
humble
*NL*
homestead
had
fallen
an
easy
spoil
into
Colonel
Pyncheon
's
grasp
.
When
*NL*
it
was
understood
,
however
,
that
the
Colonel
intended
to
erect
a
family
*NL*
mansion-spacious
,
ponderously
framed
of
oaken
timber
,
and
calculated
to
*NL*
endure
for
many
generations
of
his
posterity
over
the
spot
first
*NL*
covered
by
the
log-built
hut
of
Matthew
Maule
,
there
was
much
shaking
*NL*
of
the
head
among
the
village
gossips
.
Without
absolutely
expressing
a
*NL*
doubt
whether
the
stalwart
Puritan
had
acted
as
a
man
of
conscience
and
*NL*
integrity
throughout
the
proceedings
which
have
been
sketched
,
they
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
hinted
that
he
was
about
to
build
his
house
over
an
*NL*
unquiet
grave
.
His
home
would
include
the
home
of
the
dead
and
buried
*NL*
wizard
,
and
would
thus
afford
the
ghost
of
the
latter
a
kind
of
*NL*
privilege
to
haunt
its
new
apartments
,
and
the
chambers
into
which
*NL*
future
bridegrooms
were
to
lead
their
brides
,
and
where
children
of
the
*NL*
Pyncheon
blood
were
to
be
born
.
The
terror
and
ugliness
of
Maule
's
*NL*
crime
,
and
the
wretchedness
of
his
punishment
,
would
darken
the
freshly
*NL*
plastered
walls
,
and
infect
them
early
with
the
scent
of
an
old
and
*NL*
melancholy
house
.
Why
,
then
,
--
while
so
much
of
the
soil
around
him
was
*NL*
bestrewn
with
the
virgin
forest
leaves
,
--
why
should
Colonel
Pyncheon
*NL*
prefer
a
site
that
had
already
been
accurst
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Puritan
soldier
and
magistrate
was
not
a
man
to
be
turned
aside
*NL*
from
his
well-considered
scheme
,
either
by
dread
of
the
wizard
's
ghost
,
*NL*
or
by
flimsy
sentimentalities
of
any
kind
,
however
specious
.
Had
he
*NL*
been
told
of
a
bad
air
,
it
might
have
moved
him
somewhat
;
but
he
was
*NL*
ready
to
encounter
an
evil
spirit
on
his
own
ground
.
Endowed
with
*NL*
commonsense
,
as
massive
and
hard
as
blocks
of
granite
,
fastened
*NL*
together
by
stern
rigidity
of
purpose
,
as
with
iron
clamps
,
he
followed
*NL*
out
his
original
design
,
probably
without
so
much
as
imagining
an
*NL*
objection
to
it
.
On
the
score
of
delicacy
,
or
any
scrupulousness
which
*NL*
a
finer
sensibility
might
have
taught
him
,
the
Colonel
,
like
most
of
*NL*
his
breed
and
generation
,
was
impenetrable
.
He
therefore
dug
his
*NL*
cellar
,
and
laid
the
deep
foundations
of
his
mansion
,
on
the
square
of
*NL*
earth
whence
Matthew
Maule
,
forty
years
before
,
had
first
swept
away
*NL*
the
fallen
leaves
.
It
was
a
curious
,
and
,
as
some
people
thought
,
an
*NL*
ominous
fact
,
that
,
very
soon
after
the
workmen
began
their
operations
,
*NL*
the
spring
of
water
,
above
mentioned
,
entirely
lost
the
deliciousness
*NL*
of
its
pristine
quality
.
Whether
its
sources
were
disturbed
by
the
*NL*
depth
of
the
new
cellar
,
or
whatever
subtler
cause
might
lurk
at
the
*NL*
bottom
,
it
is
certain
that
the
water
of
Maule
's
Well
,
as
it
continued
*NL*
to
be
called
,
grew
hard
and
brackish
.
Even
such
we
find
it
now
;
and
*NL*
any
old
woman
of
the
neighborhood
will
certify
that
it
is
productive
of
*NL*
intestinal
mischief
to
those
who
quench
their
thirst
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
deem
it
singular
that
the
head
carpenter
of
the
new
*NL*
edifice
was
no
other
than
the
son
of
the
very
man
from
whose
dead
gripe
*NL*
the
property
of
the
soil
had
been
wrested
.
Not
improbably
he
was
the
*NL*
best
workman
of
his
time
;
or
,
perhaps
,
the
Colonel
thought
it
*NL*
expedient
,
or
was
impelled
by
some
better
feeling
,
thus
openly
to
cast
*NL*
aside
all
animosity
against
the
race
of
his
fallen
antagonist
.
Nor
was
*NL*
it
out
of
keeping
with
the
general
coarseness
and
matter-of-fact
*NL*
character
of
the
age
,
that
the
son
should
be
willing
to
earn
an
honest
*NL*
penny
,
or
,
rather
,
a
weighty
amount
of
sterling
pounds
,
from
the
purse
*NL*
of
his
father
's
deadly
enemy
.
At
all
events
,
Thomas
Maule
became
the
*NL*
architect
of
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
and
performed
his
duty
so
*NL*
faithfully
that
the
timber
framework
fastened
by
his
hands
still
holds
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
great
house
was
built
.
Familiar
as
it
stands
in
the
writer
's
*NL*
recollection
,
--
for
it
has
been
an
object
of
curiosity
with
him
from
*NL*
boyhood
,
both
as
a
specimen
of
the
best
and
stateliest
architecture
of
*NL*
a
longpast
epoch
,
and
as
the
scene
of
events
more
full
of
human
*NL*
interest
,
perhaps
,
than
those
of
a
gray
feudal
castle
,
--
familiar
as
it
*NL*
stands
,
in
its
rusty
old
age
,
it
is
therefore
only
the
more
difficult
*NL*
to
imagine
the
bright
novelty
with
which
it
first
caught
the
sunshine
.
*NL*
The
impression
of
its
actual
state
,
at
this
distance
of
a
hundred
and
*NL*
sixty
years
,
darkens
inevitably
through
the
picture
which
we
would
fain
*NL*
give
of
its
appearance
on
the
morning
when
the
Puritan
magnate
bade
all
*NL*
the
town
to
be
his
guests
.
A
ceremony
of
consecration
,
festive
as
well
*NL*
as
religious
,
was
now
to
be
performed
.
A
prayer
and
discourse
from
the
*NL*
Rev.
Mr.
Higginson
,
and
the
outpouring
of
a
psalm
from
the
general
*NL*
throat
of
the
community
,
was
to
be
made
acceptable
to
the
grosser
sense
*NL*
by
ale
,
cider
,
wine
,
and
brandy
,
in
copious
effusion
,
and
,
as
some
*NL*
authorities
aver
,
by
an
ox
,
roasted
whole
,
or
at
least
,
by
the
weight
*NL*
and
substance
of
an
ox
,
in
more
manageable
joints
and
sirloins
.
The
*NL*
carcass
of
a
deer
,
shot
within
twenty
miles
,
had
supplied
material
for
*NL*
the
vast
circumference
of
a
pasty
.
A
codfish
of
sixty
pounds
,
caught
*NL*
in
the
bay
,
had
been
dissolved
into
the
rich
liquid
of
a
chowder
.
The
*NL*
chimney
of
the
new
house
,
in
short
,
belching
forth
its
kitchen
smoke
,
*NL*
impregnated
the
whole
air
with
the
scent
of
meats
,
fowls
,
and
fishes
,
*NL*
spicily
concocted
with
odoriferous
herbs
,
and
onions
in
abundance
.
The
*NL*
mere
smell
of
such
festivity
,
making
its
way
to
everybody
's
nostrils
,
*NL*
was
at
once
an
invitation
and
an
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maule
's
Lane
,
or
Pyncheon
Street
,
as
it
were
now
more
decorous
to
call
*NL*
it
,
was
thronged
,
at
the
appointed
hour
,
as
with
a
congregation
on
its
*NL*
way
to
church
.
All
,
as
they
approached
,
looked
upward
at
the
imposing
*NL*
edifice
,
which
was
henceforth
to
assume
its
rank
among
the
habitations
*NL*
of
mankind
.
There
it
rose
,
a
little
withdrawn
from
the
line
of
the
*NL*
street
,
but
in
pride
,
not
modesty
.
Its
whole
visible
exterior
was
*NL*
ornamented
with
quaint
figures
,
conceived
in
the
grotesqueness
of
a
*NL*
Gothic
fancy
,
and
drawn
or
stamped
in
the
glittering
plaster
,
composed
*NL*
of
lime
,
pebbles
,
and
bits
of
glass
,
with
which
the
woodwork
of
the
*NL*
walls
was
overspread
.
On
every
side
the
seven
gables
pointed
sharply
*NL*
towards
the
sky
,
and
presented
the
aspect
of
a
whole
sisterhood
of
*NL*
edifices
,
breathing
through
the
spiracles
of
one
great
chimney
.
The
*NL*
many
lattices
,
with
their
small
,
diamond-shaped
panes
,
admitted
the
*NL*
sunlight
into
hall
and
chamber
,
while
,
nevertheless
,
the
second
story
,
*NL*
projecting
far
over
the
base
,
and
itself
retiring
beneath
the
third
,
*NL*
threw
a
shadowy
and
thoughtful
gloom
into
the
lower
rooms
.
Carved
*NL*
globes
of
wood
were
affixed
under
the
jutting
stories
.
Little
spiral
*NL*
rods
of
iron
beautified
each
of
the
seven
peaks
.
On
the
triangular
*NL*
portion
of
the
gable
,
that
fronted
next
the
street
,
was
a
dial
,
put
up
*NL*
that
very
morning
,
and
on
which
the
sun
was
still
marking
the
passage
*NL*
of
the
first
bright
hour
in
a
history
that
was
not
destined
to
be
all
*NL*
so
bright
.
All
around
were
scattered
shavings
,
chips
,
shingles
,
and
*NL*
broken
halves
of
bricks
;
these
,
together
with
the
lately
turned
earth
,
*NL*
on
which
the
grass
had
not
begun
to
grow
,
contributed
to
the
impression
*NL*
of
strangeness
and
novelty
proper
to
a
house
that
had
yet
its
place
to
*NL*
make
among
men
's
daily
interests
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
principal
entrance
,
which
had
almost
the
breadth
of
a
church-door
,
*NL*
was
in
the
angle
between
the
two
front
gables
,
and
was
covered
by
an
*NL*
open
porch
,
with
benches
beneath
its
shelter
.
Under
this
arched
*NL*
doorway
,
scraping
their
feet
on
the
unworn
threshold
,
now
trod
the
*NL*
clergymen
,
the
elders
,
the
magistrates
,
the
deacons
,
and
whatever
of
*NL*
aristocracy
there
was
in
town
or
county
.
Thither
,
too
,
thronged
the
*NL*
plebeian
classes
as
freely
as
their
betters
,
and
in
larger
number
.
*NL*
Just
within
the
entrance
,
however
,
stood
two
serving-men
,
pointing
some
*NL*
of
the
guests
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
kitchen
and
ushering
others
*NL*
into
the
statelier
rooms
,
--
hospitable
alike
to
all
,
but
still
with
a
*NL*
scrutinizing
regard
to
the
high
or
low
degree
of
each
.
Velvet
garments
*NL*
sombre
but
rich
,
stiffly
plaited
ruffs
and
bands
,
embroidered
gloves
,
*NL*
venerable
beards
,
the
mien
and
countenance
of
authority
,
made
it
easy
*NL*
to
distinguish
the
gentleman
of
worship
,
at
that
period
,
from
the
*NL*
tradesman
,
with
his
plodding
air
,
or
the
laborer
,
in
his
leathern
*NL*
jerkin
,
stealing
awe-stricken
into
the
house
which
he
had
perhaps
*NL*
helped
to
build
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
inauspicious
circumstance
there
was
,
which
awakened
a
hardly
*NL*
concealed
displeasure
in
the
breasts
of
a
few
of
the
more
punctilious
*NL*
visitors
.
The
founder
of
this
stately
mansion
--
a
gentleman
noted
for
*NL*
the
square
and
ponderous
courtesy
of
his
demeanor
,
ought
surely
to
have
*NL*
stood
in
his
own
hall
,
and
to
have
offered
the
first
welcome
to
so
many
*NL*
eminent
personages
as
here
presented
themselves
in
honor
of
his
solemn
*NL*
festival
.
He
was
as
yet
invisible
;
the
most
favored
of
the
guests
had
*NL*
not
beheld
him
.
This
sluggishness
on
Colonel
Pyncheon
's
part
became
*NL*
still
more
unaccountable
,
when
the
second
dignitary
of
the
province
*NL*
made
his
appearance
,
and
found
no
more
ceremonious
a
reception
.
The
*NL*
lieutenant-governor
,
although
his
visit
was
one
of
the
anticipated
*NL*
glories
of
the
day
,
had
alighted
from
his
horse
,
and
assisted
his
lady
*NL*
from
her
side-saddle
,
and
crossed
the
Colonel
's
threshold
,
without
*NL*
other
greeting
than
that
of
the
principal
domestic
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
person
--
a
gray-headed
man
,
of
quiet
and
most
respectful
*NL*
deportment
--
found
it
necessary
to
explain
that
his
master
still
*NL*
remained
in
his
study
,
or
private
apartment
;
on
entering
which
,
an
hour
*NL*
before
,
he
had
expressed
a
wish
on
no
account
to
be
disturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
you
see
,
fellow
,
''
said
the
high-sheriff
of
the
county
,
taking
*NL*
the
servant
aside
,
``
that
this
is
no
less
a
man
than
the
*NL*
lieutenant-governor
?
Summon
Colonel
Pyncheon
at
once
!
I
know
that
he
*NL*
received
letters
from
England
this
morning
;
and
,
in
the
perusal
and
*NL*
consideration
of
them
,
an
hour
may
have
passed
away
without
his
*NL*
noticing
it
.
But
he
will
be
ill-pleased
,
I
judge
,
if
you
suffer
him
to
*NL*
neglect
the
courtesy
due
to
one
of
our
chief
rulers
,
and
who
may
be
*NL*
said
to
represent
King
William
,
in
the
absence
of
the
governor
himself
.
*NL*
Call
your
master
instantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
please
your
worship
,
''
answered
the
man
,
in
much
perplexity
,
but
*NL*
with
a
backwardness
that
strikingly
indicated
the
hard
and
severe
*NL*
character
of
Colonel
Pyncheon
's
domestic
rule
;
``
my
master
's
orders
were
*NL*
exceeding
strict
;
and
,
as
your
worship
knows
,
he
permits
of
no
*NL*
discretion
in
the
obedience
of
those
who
owe
him
service
.
Let
who
list
*NL*
open
yonder
door
;
I
dare
not
,
though
the
governor
's
own
voice
should
*NL*
bid
me
do
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
,
pooh
,
master
high
sheriff
!
''
cried
the
lieutenant-governor
,
who
*NL*
had
overheard
the
foregoing
discussion
,
and
felt
himself
high
enough
in
*NL*
station
to
play
a
little
with
his
dignity
.
``
I
will
take
the
matter
*NL*
into
my
own
hands
.
It
is
time
that
the
good
Colonel
came
forth
to
*NL*
greet
his
friends
;
else
we
shall
be
apt
to
suspect
that
he
has
taken
a
*NL*
sip
too
much
of
his
Canary
wine
,
in
his
extreme
deliberation
which
cask
*NL*
it
were
best
to
broach
in
honor
of
the
day
!
But
since
he
is
so
much
*NL*
behindhand
,
I
will
give
him
a
remembrancer
myself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
with
such
a
tramp
of
his
ponderous
riding-boots
as
might
*NL*
of
itself
have
been
audible
in
the
remotest
of
the
seven
gables
,
he
*NL*
advanced
to
the
door
,
which
the
servant
pointed
out
,
and
made
its
new
*NL*
panels
reecho
with
a
loud
,
free
knock
.
Then
,
looking
round
,
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
to
the
spectators
,
he
awaited
a
response
.
As
none
came
,
*NL*
however
,
he
knocked
again
,
but
with
the
same
unsatisfactory
result
as
*NL*
at
first
.
And
now
,
being
a
trifle
choleric
in
his
temperament
,
the
*NL*
lieutenant-governor
uplifted
the
heavy
hilt
of
his
sword
,
wherewith
he
*NL*
so
beat
and
banged
upon
the
door
,
that
,
as
some
of
the
bystanders
*NL*
whispered
,
the
racket
might
have
disturbed
the
dead
.
Be
that
as
it
*NL*
might
,
it
seemed
to
produce
no
awakening
effect
on
Colonel
Pyncheon
.
*NL*
When
the
sound
subsided
,
the
silence
through
the
house
was
deep
,
*NL*
dreary
,
and
oppressive
,
notwithstanding
that
the
tongues
of
many
of
the
*NL*
guests
had
already
been
loosened
by
a
surreptitious
cup
or
two
of
wine
*NL*
or
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange
,
forsooth
!
--
very
strange
!
''
cried
the
lieutenant-governor
,
*NL*
whose
smile
was
changed
to
a
frown
.
``
But
seeing
that
our
host
sets
us
*NL*
the
good
example
of
forgetting
ceremony
,
I
shall
likewise
throw
it
*NL*
aside
,
and
make
free
to
intrude
on
his
privacy
.

He
tried
the
door
,
which
yielded
to
his
hand
,
and
was
flung
wide
open
*NL*
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
that
passed
,
as
with
a
loud
sigh
,
from
the
*NL*
outermost
portal
through
all
the
passages
and
apartments
of
the
new
*NL*
house
.
It
rustled
the
silken
garments
of
the
ladies
,
and
waved
the
*NL*
long
curls
of
the
gentlemen
's
wigs
,
and
shook
the
window-hangings
and
*NL*
the
curtains
of
the
bedchambers
;
causing
everywhere
a
singular
stir
,
*NL*
which
yet
was
more
like
a
hush
.
A
shadow
of
awe
and
half-fearful
*NL*
anticipation
--
nobody
knew
wherefore
,
nor
of
what
--
had
all
at
once
*NL*
fallen
over
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
thronged
,
however
,
to
the
now
open
door
,
pressing
the
*NL*
lieutenant-governor
,
in
the
eagerness
of
their
curiosity
,
into
the
room
*NL*
in
advance
of
them
.
At
the
first
glimpse
they
beheld
nothing
*NL*
extraordinary
:
a
handsomely
furnished
room
,
of
moderate
size
,
somewhat
*NL*
darkened
by
curtains
;
books
arranged
on
shelves
;
a
large
map
on
the
*NL*
wall
,
and
likewise
a
portrait
of
Colonel
Pyncheon
,
beneath
which
sat
*NL*
the
original
Colonel
himself
,
in
an
oaken
elbow-chair
,
with
a
pen
in
*NL*
his
hand
.
Letters
,
parchments
,
and
blank
sheets
of
paper
were
on
the
*NL*
table
before
him
.
He
appeared
to
gaze
at
the
curious
crowd
,
in
front
*NL*
of
which
stood
the
lieutenant-governor
;
and
there
was
a
frown
on
his
*NL*
dark
and
massive
countenance
,
as
if
sternly
resentful
of
the
boldness
*NL*
that
had
impelled
them
into
his
private
retirement
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
boy
--
the
Colonel
's
grandchild
,
and
the
only
human
being
that
*NL*
ever
dared
to
be
familiar
with
him
--
now
made
his
way
among
the
guests
,
*NL*
and
ran
towards
the
seated
figure
;
then
pausing
halfway
,
he
began
to
*NL*
shriek
with
terror
.
The
company
,
tremulous
as
the
leaves
of
a
tree
,
*NL*
when
all
are
shaking
together
,
drew
nearer
,
and
perceived
that
there
*NL*
was
an
unnatural
distortion
in
the
fixedness
of
Colonel
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
stare
;
that
there
was
blood
on
his
ruff
,
and
that
his
hoary
beard
was
*NL*
saturated
with
it
.
It
was
too
late
to
give
assistance
.
The
*NL*
iron-hearted
Puritan
,
the
relentless
persecutor
,
the
grasping
and
*NL*
strong-willed
man
was
dead
!
Dead
,
in
his
new
house
!
There
is
a
*NL*
tradition
,
only
worth
alluding
to
as
lending
a
tinge
of
superstitious
*NL*
awe
to
a
scene
perhaps
gloomy
enough
without
it
,
that
a
voice
spoke
*NL*
loudly
among
the
guests
,
the
tones
of
which
were
like
those
of
old
*NL*
Matthew
Maule
,
the
executed
wizard
,
--
``
God
hath
given
him
blood
to
*NL*
drink
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
early
had
that
one
guest
,
--
the
only
guest
who
is
certain
,
at
one
*NL*
time
or
another
,
to
find
his
way
into
every
human
dwelling
,
--
thus
early
*NL*
had
Death
stepped
across
the
threshold
of
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
!
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Pyncheon
's
sudden
and
mysterious
end
made
a
vast
deal
of
noise
*NL*
in
its
day
.
There
were
many
rumors
,
some
of
which
have
vaguely
drifted
*NL*
down
to
the
present
time
,
how
that
appearances
indicated
violence
;
that
*NL*
there
were
the
marks
of
fingers
on
his
throat
,
and
the
print
of
a
*NL*
bloody
hand
on
his
plaited
ruff
;
and
that
his
peaked
beard
was
*NL*
dishevelled
,
as
if
it
had
been
fiercely
clutched
and
pulled
.
It
was
*NL*
averred
,
likewise
,
that
the
lattice
window
,
near
the
Colonel
's
chair
,
*NL*
was
open
;
and
that
,
only
a
few
minutes
before
the
fatal
occurrence
,
the
*NL*
figure
of
a
man
had
been
seen
clambering
over
the
garden
fence
,
in
the
*NL*
rear
of
the
house
.
But
it
were
folly
to
lay
any
stress
on
stories
of
*NL*
this
kind
,
which
are
sure
to
spring
up
around
such
an
event
as
that
now
*NL*
related
,
and
which
,
as
in
the
present
case
,
sometimes
prolong
*NL*
themselves
for
ages
afterwards
,
like
the
toadstools
that
indicate
where
*NL*
the
fallen
and
buried
trunk
of
a
tree
has
long
since
mouldered
into
the
*NL*
earth
.
For
our
own
part
,
we
allow
them
just
as
little
credence
as
to
*NL*
that
other
fable
of
the
skeleton
hand
which
the
lieutenant-governor
was
*NL*
said
to
have
seen
at
the
Colonel
's
throat
,
but
which
vanished
away
,
as
*NL*
he
advanced
farther
into
the
room
.
Certain
it
is
,
however
,
that
there
*NL*
was
a
great
consultation
and
dispute
of
doctors
over
the
dead
body
.
*NL*
One
,
--
John
Swinnerton
by
name
,
--
who
appears
to
have
been
a
man
of
*NL*
eminence
,
upheld
it
,
if
we
have
rightly
understood
his
terms
of
art
,
to
*NL*
be
a
case
of
apoplexy
.
His
professional
brethren
,
each
for
himself
,
*NL*
adopted
various
hypotheses
,
more
or
less
plausible
,
but
all
dressed
out
*NL*
in
a
perplexing
mystery
of
phrase
,
which
,
if
it
do
not
show
a
*NL*
bewilderment
of
mind
in
these
erudite
physicians
,
certainly
causes
it
*NL*
in
the
unlearned
peruser
of
their
opinions
.
The
coroner
's
jury
sat
*NL*
upon
the
corpse
,
and
,
like
sensible
men
,
returned
an
unassailable
*NL*
verdict
of
``
Sudden
Death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
indeed
difficult
to
imagine
that
there
could
have
been
a
serious
*NL*
suspicion
of
murder
,
or
the
slightest
grounds
for
implicating
any
*NL*
particular
individual
as
the
perpetrator
.
The
rank
,
wealth
,
and
*NL*
eminent
character
of
the
deceased
must
have
insured
the
strictest
*NL*
scrutiny
into
every
ambiguous
circumstance
.
As
none
such
is
on
record
,
*NL*
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
none
existed
.
Tradition
,
--
which
sometimes
*NL*
brings
down
truth
that
history
has
let
slip
,
but
is
oftener
the
wild
*NL*
babble
of
the
time
,
such
as
was
formerly
spoken
at
the
fireside
and
now
*NL*
congeals
in
newspapers
,
--
tradition
is
responsible
for
all
contrary
*NL*
averments
.
In
Colonel
Pyncheon
's
funeral
sermon
,
which
was
printed
,
*NL*
and
is
still
extant
,
the
Rev.
Mr.
Higginson
enumerates
,
among
the
many
*NL*
felicities
of
his
distinguished
parishioner
's
earthly
career
,
the
happy
*NL*
seasonableness
of
his
death
.
His
duties
all
performed
,
--
the
highest
*NL*
prosperity
attained
,
--
his
race
and
future
generations
fixed
on
a
stable
*NL*
basis
,
and
with
a
stately
roof
to
shelter
them
for
centuries
to
*NL*
come
,
--
what
other
upward
step
remained
for
this
good
man
to
take
,
save
*NL*
the
final
step
from
earth
to
the
golden
gate
of
heaven
!
The
pious
*NL*
clergyman
surely
would
not
have
uttered
words
like
these
had
he
in
the
*NL*
least
suspected
that
the
Colonel
had
been
thrust
into
the
other
world
*NL*
with
the
clutch
of
violence
upon
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
of
Colonel
Pyncheon
,
at
the
epoch
of
his
death
,
seemed
*NL*
destined
to
as
fortunate
a
permanence
as
can
anywise
consist
with
the
*NL*
inherent
instability
of
human
affairs
.
It
might
fairly
be
anticipated
*NL*
that
the
progress
of
time
would
rather
increase
and
ripen
their
*NL*
prosperity
,
than
wear
away
and
destroy
it
.
For
,
not
only
had
his
son
*NL*
and
heir
come
into
immediate
enjoyment
of
a
rich
estate
,
but
there
was
*NL*
a
claim
through
an
Indian
deed
,
confirmed
by
a
subsequent
grant
of
the
*NL*
General
Court
,
to
a
vast
and
as
yet
unexplored
and
unmeasured
tract
of
*NL*
Eastern
lands
.
These
possessions
--
for
as
such
they
might
almost
*NL*
certainly
be
reckoned
--
comprised
the
greater
part
of
what
is
now
known
*NL*
as
Waldo
County
,
in
the
state
of
Maine
,
and
were
more
extensive
than
*NL*
many
a
dukedom
,
or
even
a
reigning
prince
's
territory
,
on
European
*NL*
soil
.
When
the
pathless
forest
that
still
covered
this
wild
*NL*
principality
should
give
place
--
as
it
inevitably
must
,
though
perhaps
*NL*
not
till
ages
hence
--
to
the
golden
fertility
of
human
culture
,
it
would
*NL*
be
the
source
of
incalculable
wealth
to
the
Pyncheon
blood
.
Had
the
*NL*
Colonel
survived
only
a
few
weeks
longer
,
it
is
probable
that
his
great
*NL*
political
influence
,
and
powerful
connections
at
home
and
abroad
,
would
*NL*
have
consummated
all
that
was
necessary
to
render
the
claim
available
.
*NL*
But
,
in
spite
of
good
Mr.
Higginson
's
congratulatory
eloquence
,
this
*NL*
appeared
to
be
the
one
thing
which
Colonel
Pyncheon
,
provident
and
*NL*
sagacious
as
he
was
,
had
allowed
to
go
at
loose
ends
.
So
far
as
the
*NL*
prospective
territory
was
concerned
,
he
unquestionably
died
too
soon
.
*NL*
His
son
lacked
not
merely
the
father
's
eminent
position
,
but
the
talent
*NL*
and
force
of
character
to
achieve
it
:
he
could
,
therefore
,
effect
*NL*
nothing
by
dint
of
political
interest
;
and
the
bare
justice
or
legality
*NL*
of
the
claim
was
not
so
apparent
,
after
the
Colonel
's
decease
,
as
it
*NL*
had
been
pronounced
in
his
lifetime
.
Some
connecting
link
had
slipped
*NL*
out
of
the
evidence
,
and
could
not
anywhere
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
Efforts
,
it
is
true
,
were
made
by
the
Pyncheons
,
not
only
then
,
but
at
*NL*
various
periods
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
afterwards
,
to
obtain
what
*NL*
they
stubbornly
persisted
in
deeming
their
right
.
But
,
in
course
of
*NL*
time
,
the
territory
was
partly
regranted
to
more
favored
individuals
,
*NL*
and
partly
cleared
and
occupied
by
actual
settlers
.
These
last
,
if
*NL*
they
ever
heard
of
the
Pyncheon
title
,
would
have
laughed
at
the
idea
*NL*
of
any
man
's
asserting
a
right
--
on
the
strength
of
mouldy
parchments
,
*NL*
signed
with
the
faded
autographs
of
governors
and
legislators
long
dead
*NL*
and
forgotten
--
to
the
lands
which
they
or
their
fathers
had
wrested
*NL*
from
the
wild
hand
of
nature
by
their
own
sturdy
toil
.
This
impalpable
*NL*
claim
,
therefore
,
resulted
in
nothing
more
solid
than
to
cherish
,
from
*NL*
generation
to
generation
,
an
absurd
delusion
of
family
importance
,
*NL*
which
all
along
characterized
the
Pyncheons
.
It
caused
the
poorest
*NL*
member
of
the
race
to
feel
as
if
he
inherited
a
kind
of
nobility
,
and
*NL*
might
yet
come
into
the
possession
of
princely
wealth
to
support
it
.
*NL*
In
the
better
specimens
of
the
breed
,
this
peculiarity
threw
an
ideal
*NL*
grace
over
the
hard
material
of
human
life
,
without
stealing
away
any
*NL*
truly
valuable
quality
.
In
the
baser
sort
,
its
effect
was
to
increase
*NL*
the
liability
to
sluggishness
and
dependence
,
and
induce
the
victim
of
*NL*
a
shadowy
hope
to
remit
all
self-effort
,
while
awaiting
the
realization
*NL*
of
his
dreams
.
Years
and
years
after
their
claim
had
passed
out
of
the
*NL*
public
memory
,
the
Pyncheons
were
accustomed
to
consult
the
Colonel
's
*NL*
ancient
map
,
which
had
been
projected
while
Waldo
County
was
still
an
*NL*
unbroken
wilderness
.
Where
the
old
land
surveyor
had
put
down
woods
,
*NL*
lakes
,
and
rivers
,
they
marked
out
the
cleared
spaces
,
and
dotted
the
*NL*
villages
and
towns
,
and
calculated
the
progressively
increasing
value
*NL*
of
the
territory
,
as
if
there
were
yet
a
prospect
of
its
ultimately
*NL*
forming
a
princedom
for
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
almost
every
generation
,
nevertheless
,
there
happened
to
be
some
one
*NL*
descendant
of
the
family
gifted
with
a
portion
of
the
hard
,
keen
sense
,
*NL*
and
practical
energy
,
that
had
so
remarkably
distinguished
the
original
*NL*
founder
.
His
character
,
indeed
,
might
be
traced
all
the
way
down
,
as
*NL*
distinctly
as
if
the
Colonel
himself
,
a
little
diluted
,
had
been
gifted
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
intermittent
immortality
on
earth
.
At
two
or
three
*NL*
epochs
,
when
the
fortunes
of
the
family
were
low
,
this
representative
*NL*
of
hereditary
qualities
had
made
his
appearance
,
and
caused
the
*NL*
traditionary
gossips
of
the
town
to
whisper
among
themselves
,
``
Here
is
*NL*
the
old
Pyncheon
come
again
!
Now
the
Seven
Gables
will
be
*NL*
new-shingled
!
''
From
father
to
son
,
they
clung
to
the
ancestral
house
*NL*
with
singular
tenacity
of
home
attachment
.
For
various
reasons
,
*NL*
however
,
and
from
impressions
often
too
vaguely
founded
to
be
put
on
*NL*
paper
,
the
writer
cherishes
the
belief
that
many
,
if
not
most
,
of
the
*NL*
successive
proprietors
of
this
estate
were
troubled
with
doubts
as
to
*NL*
their
moral
right
to
hold
it
.
Of
their
legal
tenure
there
could
be
no
*NL*
question
;
but
old
Matthew
Maule
,
it
is
to
be
feared
,
trode
downward
*NL*
from
his
own
age
to
a
far
later
one
,
planting
a
heavy
footstep
,
all
the
*NL*
way
,
on
the
conscience
of
a
Pyncheon
.
If
so
,
we
are
left
to
dispose
of
*NL*
the
awful
query
,
whether
each
inheritor
of
the
property
--
conscious
of
*NL*
wrong
,
and
failing
to
rectify
it
--
did
not
commit
anew
the
great
guilt
*NL*
of
his
ancestor
,
and
incur
all
its
original
responsibilities
.
And
*NL*
supposing
such
to
be
the
case
,
would
it
not
be
a
far
truer
mode
of
*NL*
expression
to
say
of
the
Pyncheon
family
,
that
they
inherited
a
great
*NL*
misfortune
,
than
the
reverse
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
already
hinted
that
it
is
not
our
purpose
to
trace
down
the
*NL*
history
of
the
Pyncheon
family
,
in
its
unbroken
connection
with
the
*NL*
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
;
nor
to
show
,
as
in
a
magic
picture
,
how
the
*NL*
rustiness
and
infirmity
of
age
gathered
over
the
venerable
house
*NL*
itself
.
As
regards
its
interior
life
,
a
large
,
dim
looking-glass
used
*NL*
to
hang
in
one
of
the
rooms
,
and
was
fabled
to
contain
within
its
*NL*
depths
all
the
shapes
that
had
ever
been
reflected
there
,
--
the
old
*NL*
Colonel
himself
,
and
his
many
descendants
,
some
in
the
garb
of
antique
*NL*
babyhood
,
and
others
in
the
bloom
of
feminine
beauty
or
manly
prime
,
or
*NL*
saddened
with
the
wrinkles
of
frosty
age
.
Had
we
the
secret
of
that
*NL*
mirror
,
we
would
gladly
sit
down
before
it
,
and
transfer
its
*NL*
revelations
to
our
page
.
But
there
was
a
story
,
for
which
it
is
*NL*
difficult
to
conceive
any
foundation
,
that
the
posterity
of
Matthew
*NL*
Maule
had
some
connection
with
the
mystery
of
the
looking-glass
,
and
*NL*
that
,
by
what
appears
to
have
been
a
sort
of
mesmeric
process
,
they
*NL*
could
make
its
inner
region
all
alive
with
the
departed
Pyncheons
;
not
*NL*
as
they
had
shown
themselves
to
the
world
,
nor
in
their
better
and
*NL*
happier
hours
,
but
as
doing
over
again
some
deed
of
sin
,
or
in
the
*NL*
crisis
of
life
's
bitterest
sorrow
.
The
popular
imagination
,
indeed
,
*NL*
long
kept
itself
busy
with
the
affair
of
the
old
Puritan
Pyncheon
and
*NL*
the
wizard
Maule
;
the
curse
which
the
latter
flung
from
his
scaffold
*NL*
was
remembered
,
with
the
very
important
addition
,
that
it
had
become
a
*NL*
part
of
the
Pyncheon
inheritance
.
If
one
of
the
family
did
but
gurgle
*NL*
in
his
throat
,
a
bystander
would
be
likely
enough
to
whisper
,
between
*NL*
jest
and
earnest
,
``
He
has
Maule
's
blood
to
drink
!
''
The
sudden
death
of
*NL*
a
Pyncheon
,
about
a
hundred
years
ago
,
with
circumstances
very
similar
*NL*
to
what
have
been
related
of
the
Colonel
's
exit
,
was
held
as
giving
*NL*
additional
probability
to
the
received
opinion
on
this
topic
.
It
was
*NL*
considered
,
moreover
,
an
ugly
and
ominous
circumstance
,
that
Colonel
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
picture
--
in
obedience
,
it
was
said
,
to
a
provision
of
his
*NL*
will
--
remained
affixed
to
the
wall
of
the
room
in
which
he
died
.
Those
*NL*
stern
,
immitigable
features
seemed
to
symbolize
an
evil
influence
,
and
*NL*
so
darkly
to
mingle
the
shadow
of
their
presence
with
the
sunshine
of
*NL*
the
passing
hour
,
that
no
good
thoughts
or
purposes
could
ever
spring
*NL*
up
and
blossom
there
.
To
the
thoughtful
mind
there
will
be
no
tinge
of
*NL*
superstition
in
what
we
figuratively
express
,
by
affirming
that
the
*NL*
ghost
of
a
dead
progenitor
--
perhaps
as
a
portion
of
his
own
*NL*
punishment
--
is
often
doomed
to
become
the
Evil
Genius
of
his
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Pyncheons
,
in
brief
,
lived
along
,
for
the
better
part
of
two
*NL*
centuries
,
with
perhaps
less
of
outward
vicissitude
than
has
attended
*NL*
most
other
New
England
families
during
the
same
period
of
time
.
*NL*
Possessing
very
distinctive
traits
of
their
own
,
they
nevertheless
took
*NL*
the
general
characteristics
of
the
little
community
in
which
they
*NL*
dwelt
;
a
town
noted
for
its
frugal
,
discreet
,
well-ordered
,
and
*NL*
home-loving
inhabitants
,
as
well
as
for
the
somewhat
confined
scope
of
*NL*
its
sympathies
;
but
in
which
,
be
it
said
,
there
are
odder
individuals
,
*NL*
and
,
now
and
then
,
stranger
occurrences
,
than
one
meets
with
almost
*NL*
anywhere
else
.
During
the
Revolution
,
the
Pyncheon
of
that
epoch
,
*NL*
adopting
the
royal
side
,
became
a
refugee
;
but
repented
,
and
made
his
*NL*
reappearance
,
just
at
the
point
of
time
to
preserve
the
House
of
the
*NL*
Seven
Gables
from
confiscation
.
For
the
last
seventy
years
the
most
*NL*
noted
event
in
the
Pyncheon
annals
had
been
likewise
the
heaviest
*NL*
calamity
that
ever
befell
the
race
;
no
less
than
the
violent
death
--
for
*NL*
so
it
was
adjudged
--
of
one
member
of
the
family
by
the
criminal
act
of
*NL*
another
.
Certain
circumstances
attending
this
fatal
occurrence
had
*NL*
brought
the
deed
irresistibly
home
to
a
nephew
of
the
deceased
*NL*
Pyncheon
.
The
young
man
was
tried
and
convicted
of
the
crime
;
but
*NL*
either
the
circumstantial
nature
of
the
evidence
,
and
possibly
some
*NL*
lurking
doubts
in
the
breast
of
the
executive
,
or
,
lastly
--
an
argument
*NL*
of
greater
weight
in
a
republic
than
it
could
have
been
under
a
*NL*
monarchy
,
--
the
high
respectability
and
political
influence
of
the
*NL*
criminal
's
connections
,
had
availed
to
mitigate
his
doom
from
death
to
*NL*
perpetual
imprisonment
.
This
sad
affair
had
chanced
about
thirty
years
*NL*
before
the
action
of
our
story
commences
.
Latterly
,
there
were
rumors
*NL*
-LRB-
which
few
believed
,
and
only
one
or
two
felt
greatly
interested
in
-RRB-
*NL*
that
this
long-buried
man
was
likely
,
for
some
reason
or
other
,
to
be
*NL*
summoned
forth
from
his
living
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
essential
to
say
a
few
words
respecting
the
victim
of
this
now
*NL*
almost
forgotten
murder
.
He
was
an
old
bachelor
,
and
possessed
of
*NL*
great
wealth
,
in
addition
to
the
house
and
real
estate
which
*NL*
constituted
what
remained
of
the
ancient
Pyncheon
property
.
Being
of
*NL*
an
eccentric
and
melancholy
turn
of
mind
,
and
greatly
given
to
*NL*
rummaging
old
records
and
hearkening
to
old
traditions
,
he
had
brought
*NL*
himself
,
it
is
averred
,
to
the
conclusion
that
Matthew
Maule
,
the
*NL*
wizard
,
had
been
foully
wronged
out
of
his
homestead
,
if
not
out
of
his
*NL*
life
.
Such
being
the
case
,
and
he
,
the
old
bachelor
,
in
possession
of
*NL*
the
ill-gotten
spoil
,
--
with
the
black
stain
of
blood
sunken
deep
into
*NL*
it
,
and
still
to
be
scented
by
conscientious
nostrils
,
--
the
question
*NL*
occurred
,
whether
it
were
not
imperative
upon
him
,
even
at
this
late
*NL*
hour
,
to
make
restitution
to
Maule
's
posterity
.
To
a
man
living
so
*NL*
much
in
the
past
,
and
so
little
in
the
present
,
as
the
secluded
and
*NL*
antiquarian
old
bachelor
,
a
century
and
a
half
seemed
not
so
vast
a
*NL*
period
as
to
obviate
the
propriety
of
substituting
right
for
wrong
.
It
*NL*
was
the
belief
of
those
who
knew
him
best
,
that
he
would
positively
*NL*
have
taken
the
very
singular
step
of
giving
up
the
House
of
the
Seven
*NL*
Gables
to
the
representative
of
Matthew
Maule
,
but
for
the
unspeakable
*NL*
tumult
which
a
suspicion
of
the
old
gentleman
's
project
awakened
among
*NL*
his
Pyncheon
relatives
.
Their
exertions
had
the
effect
of
suspending
*NL*
his
purpose
;
but
it
was
feared
that
he
would
perform
,
after
death
,
by
*NL*
the
operation
of
his
last
will
,
what
he
had
so
hardly
been
prevented
*NL*
from
doing
in
his
proper
lifetime
.
But
there
is
no
one
thing
which
men
*NL*
so
rarely
do
,
whatever
the
provocation
or
inducement
,
as
to
bequeath
*NL*
patrimonial
property
away
from
their
own
blood
.
They
may
love
other
*NL*
individuals
far
better
than
their
relatives
,
--
they
may
even
cherish
*NL*
dislike
,
or
positive
hatred
,
to
the
latter
;
but
yet
,
in
view
of
death
,
*NL*
the
strong
prejudice
of
propinquity
revives
,
and
impels
the
testator
to
*NL*
send
down
his
estate
in
the
line
marked
out
by
custom
so
immemorial
*NL*
that
it
looks
like
nature
.
In
all
the
Pyncheons
,
this
feeling
had
the
*NL*
energy
of
disease
.
It
was
too
powerful
for
the
conscientious
scruples
*NL*
of
the
old
bachelor
;
at
whose
death
,
accordingly
,
the
mansion-house
,
*NL*
together
with
most
of
his
other
riches
,
passed
into
the
possession
of
*NL*
his
next
legal
representative
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
nephew
,
the
cousin
of
the
miserable
young
man
who
had
been
*NL*
convicted
of
the
uncle
's
murder
.
The
new
heir
,
up
to
the
period
of
his
*NL*
accession
,
was
reckoned
rather
a
dissipated
youth
,
but
had
at
once
*NL*
reformed
,
and
made
himself
an
exceedingly
respectable
member
of
*NL*
society
.
In
fact
,
he
showed
more
of
the
Pyncheon
quality
,
and
had
won
*NL*
higher
eminence
in
the
world
,
than
any
of
his
race
since
the
time
of
*NL*
the
original
Puritan
.
Applying
himself
in
earlier
manhood
to
the
study
*NL*
of
the
law
,
and
having
a
natural
tendency
towards
office
,
he
had
*NL*
attained
,
many
years
ago
,
to
a
judicial
situation
in
some
inferior
*NL*
court
,
which
gave
him
for
life
the
very
desirable
and
imposing
title
of
*NL*
judge
.
Later
,
he
had
engaged
in
politics
,
and
served
a
part
of
two
*NL*
terms
in
Congress
,
besides
making
a
considerable
figure
in
both
*NL*
branches
of
the
State
legislature
.
Judge
Pyncheon
was
unquestionably
*NL*
an
honor
to
his
race
.
He
had
built
himself
a
country-seat
within
a
few
*NL*
miles
of
his
native
town
,
and
there
spent
such
portions
of
his
time
as
*NL*
could
be
spared
from
public
service
in
the
display
of
every
grace
and
*NL*
virtue
--
as
a
newspaper
phrased
it
,
on
the
eve
of
an
election
--
befitting
*NL*
the
Christian
,
the
good
citizen
,
the
horticulturist
,
and
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
few
of
the
Pyncheons
left
to
sun
themselves
in
the
glow
of
*NL*
the
Judge
's
prosperity
.
In
respect
to
natural
increase
,
the
breed
had
*NL*
not
thriven
;
it
appeared
rather
to
be
dying
out
.
The
only
members
of
*NL*
the
family
known
to
be
extant
were
,
first
,
the
Judge
himself
,
and
a
*NL*
single
surviving
son
,
who
was
now
travelling
in
Europe
;
next
,
the
*NL*
thirty
years
'
prisoner
,
already
alluded
to
,
and
a
sister
of
the
latter
,
*NL*
who
occupied
,
in
an
extremely
retired
manner
,
the
House
of
the
Seven
*NL*
Gables
,
in
which
she
had
a
life-estate
by
the
will
of
the
old
bachelor
.
*NL*
She
was
understood
to
be
wretchedly
poor
,
and
seemed
to
make
it
her
*NL*
choice
to
remain
so
;
inasmuch
as
her
affluent
cousin
,
the
Judge
,
had
*NL*
repeatedly
offered
her
all
the
comforts
of
life
,
either
in
the
old
*NL*
mansion
or
his
own
modern
residence
.
The
last
and
youngest
Pyncheon
*NL*
was
a
little
country-girl
of
seventeen
,
the
daughter
of
another
of
the
*NL*
Judge
's
cousins
,
who
had
married
a
young
woman
of
no
family
or
*NL*
property
,
and
died
early
and
in
poor
circumstances
.
His
widow
had
*NL*
recently
taken
another
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Matthew
Maule
's
posterity
,
it
was
supposed
now
to
be
extinct
.
*NL*
For
a
very
long
period
after
the
witchcraft
delusion
,
however
,
the
*NL*
Maules
had
continued
to
inhabit
the
town
where
their
progenitor
had
*NL*
suffered
so
unjust
a
death
.
To
all
appearance
,
they
were
a
quiet
,
*NL*
honest
,
well-meaning
race
of
people
,
cherishing
no
malice
against
*NL*
individuals
or
the
public
for
the
wrong
which
had
been
done
them
;
or
*NL*
if
,
at
their
own
fireside
,
they
transmitted
from
father
to
child
any
*NL*
hostile
recollection
of
the
wizard
's
fate
and
their
lost
patrimony
,
it
*NL*
was
never
acted
upon
,
nor
openly
expressed
.
Nor
would
it
have
been
*NL*
singular
had
they
ceased
to
remember
that
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
*NL*
was
resting
its
heavy
framework
on
a
foundation
that
was
rightfully
*NL*
their
own
.
There
is
something
so
massive
,
stable
,
and
almost
*NL*
irresistibly
imposing
in
the
exterior
presentment
of
established
rank
*NL*
and
great
possessions
,
that
their
very
existence
seems
to
give
them
a
*NL*
right
to
exist
;
at
least
,
so
excellent
a
counterfeit
of
right
,
that
few
*NL*
poor
and
humble
men
have
moral
force
enough
to
question
it
,
even
in
*NL*
their
secret
minds
.
Such
is
the
case
now
,
after
so
many
ancient
*NL*
prejudices
have
been
overthrown
;
and
it
was
far
more
so
in
*NL*
ante-Revolutionary
days
,
when
the
aristocracy
could
venture
to
be
*NL*
proud
,
and
the
low
were
content
to
be
abased
.
Thus
the
Maules
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
kept
their
resentments
within
their
own
breasts
.
They
were
*NL*
generally
poverty-stricken
;
always
plebeian
and
obscure
;
working
with
*NL*
unsuccessful
diligence
at
handicrafts
;
laboring
on
the
wharves
,
or
*NL*
following
the
sea
,
as
sailors
before
the
mast
;
living
here
and
there
*NL*
about
the
town
,
in
hired
tenements
,
and
coming
finally
to
the
almshouse
*NL*
as
the
natural
home
of
their
old
age
.
At
last
,
after
creeping
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
for
such
a
length
of
time
along
the
utmost
verge
of
the
opaque
*NL*
puddle
of
obscurity
,
they
had
taken
that
downright
plunge
which
,
sooner
*NL*
or
later
,
is
the
destiny
of
all
families
,
whether
princely
or
plebeian
.
*NL*
For
thirty
years
past
,
neither
town-record
,
nor
gravestone
,
nor
the
*NL*
directory
,
nor
the
knowledge
or
memory
of
man
,
bore
any
trace
of
*NL*
Matthew
Maule
's
descendants
.
His
blood
might
possibly
exist
elsewhere
;
*NL*
here
,
where
its
lowly
current
could
be
traced
so
far
back
,
it
had
*NL*
ceased
to
keep
an
onward
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
long
as
any
of
the
race
were
to
be
found
,
they
had
been
marked
out
*NL*
from
other
men
--
not
strikingly
,
nor
as
with
a
sharp
line
,
but
with
an
*NL*
effect
that
was
felt
rather
than
spoken
of
--
by
an
hereditary
character
*NL*
of
reserve
.
Their
companions
,
or
those
who
endeavored
to
become
such
,
*NL*
grew
conscious
of
a
circle
round
about
the
Maules
,
within
the
sanctity
*NL*
or
the
spell
of
which
,
in
spite
of
an
exterior
of
sufficient
frankness
*NL*
and
good-fellowship
,
it
was
impossible
for
any
man
to
step
.
It
was
*NL*
this
indefinable
peculiarity
,
perhaps
,
that
,
by
insulating
them
from
*NL*
human
aid
,
kept
them
always
so
unfortunate
in
life
.
It
certainly
*NL*
operated
to
prolong
in
their
case
,
and
to
confirm
to
them
as
their
only
*NL*
inheritance
,
those
feelings
of
repugnance
and
superstitious
terror
with
*NL*
which
the
people
of
the
town
,
even
after
awakening
from
their
frenzy
,
*NL*
continued
to
regard
the
memory
of
the
reputed
witches
.
The
mantle
,
or
*NL*
rather
the
ragged
cloak
,
of
old
Matthew
Maule
had
fallen
upon
his
*NL*
children
.
They
were
half
believed
to
inherit
mysterious
attributes
;
*NL*
the
family
eye
was
said
to
possess
strange
power
.
Among
other
*NL*
good-for-nothing
properties
and
privileges
,
one
was
especially
assigned
*NL*
them
,
--
that
of
exercising
an
influence
over
people
's
dreams
.
The
*NL*
Pyncheons
,
if
all
stories
were
true
,
haughtily
as
they
bore
themselves
*NL*
in
the
noonday
streets
of
their
native
town
,
were
no
better
than
*NL*
bond-servants
to
these
plebeian
Maules
,
on
entering
the
topsy-turvy
*NL*
commonwealth
of
sleep
.
Modern
psychology
,
it
may
be
,
will
endeavor
to
*NL*
reduce
these
alleged
necromancies
within
a
system
,
instead
of
rejecting
*NL*
them
as
altogether
fabulous
.

*NL*
A
descriptive
paragraph
or
two
,
treating
of
the
seven-gabled
mansion
in
*NL*
its
more
recent
aspect
,
will
bring
this
preliminary
chapter
to
a
close
.
*NL*
The
street
in
which
it
upreared
its
venerable
peaks
has
long
ceased
to
*NL*
be
a
fashionable
quarter
of
the
town
;
so
that
,
though
the
old
edifice
*NL*
was
surrounded
by
habitations
of
modern
date
,
they
were
mostly
small
,
*NL*
built
entirely
of
wood
,
and
typical
of
the
most
plodding
uniformity
of
*NL*
common
life
.
Doubtless
,
however
,
the
whole
story
of
human
existence
*NL*
may
be
latent
in
each
of
them
,
but
with
no
picturesqueness
,
externally
,
*NL*
that
can
attract
the
imagination
or
sympathy
to
seek
it
there
.
But
as
*NL*
for
the
old
structure
of
our
story
,
its
white-oak
frame
,
and
its
*NL*
boards
,
shingles
,
and
crumbling
plaster
,
and
even
the
huge
,
clustered
*NL*
chimney
in
the
midst
,
seemed
to
constitute
only
the
least
and
meanest
*NL*
part
of
its
reality
.
So
much
of
mankind
's
varied
experience
had
passed
*NL*
there
,
--
so
much
had
been
suffered
,
and
something
,
too
,
enjoyed
,
--
that
*NL*
the
very
timbers
were
oozy
,
as
with
the
moisture
of
a
heart
.
It
was
*NL*
itself
like
a
great
human
heart
,
with
a
life
of
its
own
,
and
full
of
*NL*
rich
and
sombre
reminiscences
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deep
projection
of
the
second
story
gave
the
house
such
a
*NL*
meditative
look
,
that
you
could
not
pass
it
without
the
idea
that
it
*NL*
had
secrets
to
keep
,
and
an
eventful
history
to
moralize
upon
.
In
*NL*
front
,
just
on
the
edge
of
the
unpaved
sidewalk
,
grew
the
Pyncheon
Elm
,
*NL*
which
,
in
reference
to
such
trees
as
one
usually
meets
with
,
might
well
*NL*
be
termed
gigantic
.
It
had
been
planted
by
a
great-grandson
of
the
*NL*
first
Pyncheon
,
and
,
though
now
four-score
years
of
age
,
or
perhaps
*NL*
nearer
a
hundred
,
was
still
in
its
strong
and
broad
maturity
,
throwing
*NL*
its
shadow
from
side
to
side
of
the
street
,
overtopping
the
seven
*NL*
gables
,
and
sweeping
the
whole
black
roof
with
its
pendant
foliage
.
It
*NL*
gave
beauty
to
the
old
edifice
,
and
seemed
to
make
it
a
part
of
nature
.
*NL*
The
street
having
been
widened
about
forty
years
ago
,
the
front
gable
*NL*
was
now
precisely
on
a
line
with
it
.
On
either
side
extended
a
ruinous
*NL*
wooden
fence
of
open
lattice-work
,
through
which
could
be
seen
a
grassy
*NL*
yard
,
and
,
especially
in
the
angles
of
the
building
,
an
enormous
*NL*
fertility
of
burdocks
,
with
leaves
,
it
is
hardly
an
exaggeration
to
*NL*
say
,
two
or
three
feet
long
.
Behind
the
house
there
appeared
to
be
a
*NL*
garden
,
which
undoubtedly
had
once
been
extensive
,
but
was
now
*NL*
infringed
upon
by
other
enclosures
,
or
shut
in
by
habitations
and
*NL*
outbuildings
that
stood
on
another
street
.
It
would
be
an
omission
,
*NL*
trifling
,
indeed
,
but
unpardonable
,
were
we
to
forget
the
green
moss
*NL*
that
had
long
since
gathered
over
the
projections
of
the
windows
,
and
*NL*
on
the
slopes
of
the
roof
nor
must
we
fail
to
direct
the
reader
's
eye
*NL*
to
a
crop
,
not
of
weeds
,
but
flower-shrubs
,
which
were
growing
aloft
in
*NL*
the
air
,
not
a
great
way
from
the
chimney
,
in
the
nook
between
two
of
*NL*
the
gables
.
They
were
called
Alice
's
Posies
.
The
tradition
was
,
that
*NL*
a
certain
Alice
Pyncheon
had
flung
up
the
seeds
,
in
sport
,
and
that
the
*NL*
dust
of
the
street
and
the
decay
of
the
roof
gradually
formed
a
kind
of
*NL*
soil
for
them
,
out
of
which
they
grew
,
when
Alice
had
long
been
in
her
*NL*
grave
.
However
the
flowers
might
have
come
there
,
it
was
both
sad
and
*NL*
sweet
to
observe
how
Nature
adopted
to
herself
this
desolate
,
decaying
,
*NL*
gusty
,
rusty
old
house
of
the
Pyncheon
family
;
and
how
the
*NL*
ever-returning
Summer
did
her
best
to
gladden
it
with
tender
beauty
,
*NL*
and
grew
melancholy
in
the
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
one
other
feature
,
very
essential
to
be
noticed
,
but
which
,
we
*NL*
greatly
fear
,
may
damage
any
picturesque
and
romantic
impression
which
*NL*
we
have
been
willing
to
throw
over
our
sketch
of
this
respectable
*NL*
edifice
.
In
the
front
gable
,
under
the
impending
brow
of
the
second
*NL*
story
,
and
contiguous
to
the
street
,
was
a
shop-door
,
divided
*NL*
horizontally
in
the
midst
,
and
with
a
window
for
its
upper
segment
,
*NL*
such
as
is
often
seen
in
dwellings
of
a
somewhat
ancient
date
.
This
*NL*
same
shop-door
had
been
a
subject
of
no
slight
mortification
to
the
*NL*
present
occupant
of
the
august
Pyncheon
House
,
as
well
as
to
some
of
*NL*
her
predecessors
.
The
matter
is
disagreeably
delicate
to
handle
;
but
,
*NL*
since
the
reader
must
needs
be
let
into
the
secret
,
he
will
please
to
*NL*
understand
,
that
,
about
a
century
ago
,
the
head
of
the
Pyncheons
found
*NL*
himself
involved
in
serious
financial
difficulties
.
The
fellow
*NL*
-LRB-
gentleman
,
as
he
styled
himself
-RRB-
can
hardly
have
been
other
than
a
*NL*
spurious
interloper
;
for
,
instead
of
seeking
office
from
the
king
or
*NL*
the
royal
governor
,
or
urging
his
hereditary
claim
to
Eastern
lands
,
he
*NL*
bethought
himself
of
no
better
avenue
to
wealth
than
by
cutting
a
*NL*
shop-door
through
the
side
of
his
ancestral
residence
.
It
was
the
*NL*
custom
of
the
time
,
indeed
,
for
merchants
to
store
their
goods
and
*NL*
transact
business
in
their
own
dwellings
.
But
there
was
something
*NL*
pitifully
small
in
this
old
Pyncheon
's
mode
of
setting
about
his
*NL*
commercial
operations
;
it
was
whispered
,
that
,
with
his
own
hands
,
all
*NL*
beruffled
as
they
were
,
he
used
to
give
change
for
a
shilling
,
and
*NL*
would
turn
a
half-penny
twice
over
,
to
make
sure
that
it
was
a
good
*NL*
one
.
Beyond
all
question
,
he
had
the
blood
of
a
petty
huckster
in
his
*NL*
veins
,
through
whatever
channel
it
may
have
found
its
way
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
on
his
death
,
the
shop-door
had
been
locked
,
bolted
,
and
*NL*
barred
,
and
,
down
to
the
period
of
our
story
,
had
probably
never
once
*NL*
been
opened
.
The
old
counter
,
shelves
,
and
other
fixtures
of
the
*NL*
little
shop
remained
just
as
he
had
left
them
.
It
used
to
be
affirmed
,
*NL*
that
the
dead
shop-keeper
,
in
a
white
wig
,
a
faded
velvet
coat
,
an
*NL*
apron
at
his
waist
,
and
his
ruffles
carefully
turned
back
from
his
*NL*
wrists
,
might
be
seen
through
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
,
any
night
of
*NL*
the
year
,
ransacking
his
till
,
or
poring
over
the
dingy
pages
of
his
*NL*
day-book
.
From
the
look
of
unutterable
woe
upon
his
face
,
it
appeared
*NL*
to
be
his
doom
to
spend
eternity
in
a
vain
effort
to
make
his
accounts
*NL*
balance
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
--
in
a
very
humble
way
,
as
will
be
seen
--
we
proceed
to
open
our
*NL*
narrative
.

II
The
Little
Shop-Window
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
still
lacked
half
an
hour
of
sunrise
,
when
Miss
Hepzibah
*NL*
Pyncheon
--
we
will
not
say
awoke
,
it
being
doubtful
whether
the
poor
*NL*
lady
had
so
much
as
closed
her
eyes
during
the
brief
night
of
*NL*
midsummer
--
but
,
at
all
events
,
arose
from
her
solitary
pillow
,
and
*NL*
began
what
it
would
be
mockery
to
term
the
adornment
of
her
person
.
*NL*
Far
from
us
be
the
indecorum
of
assisting
,
even
in
imagination
,
at
a
*NL*
maiden
lady
's
toilet
!
Our
story
must
therefore
await
Miss
Hepzibah
at
*NL*
the
threshold
of
her
chamber
;
only
presuming
,
meanwhile
,
to
note
some
*NL*
of
the
heavy
sighs
that
labored
from
her
bosom
,
with
little
restraint
*NL*
as
to
their
lugubrious
depth
and
volume
of
sound
,
inasmuch
as
they
*NL*
could
be
audible
to
nobody
save
a
disembodied
listener
like
ourself
.
*NL*
The
Old
Maid
was
alone
in
the
old
house
.
Alone
,
except
for
a
certain
*NL*
respectable
and
orderly
young
man
,
an
artist
in
the
daguerreotype
line
,
*NL*
who
,
for
about
three
months
back
,
had
been
a
lodger
in
a
remote
*NL*
gable
,
--
quite
a
house
by
itself
,
indeed
,
--
with
locks
,
bolts
,
and
oaken
*NL*
bars
on
all
the
intervening
doors
.
Inaudible
,
consequently
,
were
poor
*NL*
Miss
Hepzibah
's
gusty
sighs
.
Inaudible
the
creaking
joints
of
her
*NL*
stiffened
knees
,
as
she
knelt
down
by
the
bedside
.
And
inaudible
,
too
,
*NL*
by
mortal
ear
,
but
heard
with
all-comprehending
love
and
pity
in
the
*NL*
farthest
heaven
,
that
almost
agony
of
prayer
--
now
whispered
,
now
a
*NL*
groan
,
now
a
struggling
silence
--
wherewith
she
besought
the
Divine
*NL*
assistance
through
the
day
!
Evidently
,
this
is
to
be
a
day
of
more
than
*NL*
ordinary
trial
to
Miss
Hepzibah
,
who
,
for
above
a
quarter
of
a
century
*NL*
gone
by
,
has
dwelt
in
strict
seclusion
,
taking
no
part
in
the
business
*NL*
of
life
,
and
just
as
little
in
its
intercourse
and
pleasures
.
Not
with
*NL*
such
fervor
prays
the
torpid
recluse
,
looking
forward
to
the
cold
,
*NL*
sunless
,
stagnant
calm
of
a
day
that
is
to
be
like
innumerable
*NL*
yesterdays
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
maiden
lady
's
devotions
are
concluded
.
Will
she
now
issue
forth
*NL*
over
the
threshold
of
our
story
?
Not
yet
,
by
many
moments
.
First
,
*NL*
every
drawer
in
the
tall
,
old-fashioned
bureau
is
to
be
opened
,
with
*NL*
difficulty
,
and
with
a
succession
of
spasmodic
jerks
then
,
all
must
*NL*
close
again
,
with
the
same
fidgety
reluctance
.
There
is
a
rustling
of
*NL*
stiff
silks
;
a
tread
of
backward
and
forward
footsteps
to
and
fro
*NL*
across
the
chamber
.
We
suspect
Miss
Hepzibah
,
moreover
,
of
taking
a
*NL*
step
upward
into
a
chair
,
in
order
to
give
heedful
regard
to
her
*NL*
appearance
on
all
sides
,
and
at
full
length
,
in
the
oval
,
dingy-framed
*NL*
toilet-glass
,
that
hangs
above
her
table
.
Truly
!
well
,
indeed
!
who
*NL*
would
have
thought
it
!
Is
all
this
precious
time
to
be
lavished
on
the
*NL*
matutinal
repair
and
beautifying
of
an
elderly
person
,
who
never
goes
*NL*
abroad
,
whom
nobody
ever
visits
,
and
from
whom
,
when
she
shall
have
*NL*
done
her
utmost
,
it
were
the
best
charity
to
turn
one
's
eyes
another
*NL*
way
?
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
is
almost
ready
.
Let
us
pardon
her
one
other
pause
;
for
it
is
*NL*
given
to
the
sole
sentiment
,
or
,
we
might
better
say
,
--
heightened
and
*NL*
rendered
intense
,
as
it
has
been
,
by
sorrow
and
seclusion
,
--
to
the
*NL*
strong
passion
of
her
life
.
We
heard
the
turning
of
a
key
in
a
small
*NL*
lock
;
she
has
opened
a
secret
drawer
of
an
escritoire
,
and
is
probably
*NL*
looking
at
a
certain
miniature
,
done
in
Malbone
's
most
perfect
style
,
*NL*
and
representing
a
face
worthy
of
no
less
delicate
a
pencil
.
It
was
*NL*
once
our
good
fortune
to
see
this
picture
.
It
is
a
likeness
of
a
young
*NL*
man
,
in
a
silken
dressing-gown
of
an
old
fashion
,
the
soft
richness
of
*NL*
which
is
well
adapted
to
the
countenance
of
reverie
,
with
its
full
,
*NL*
tender
lips
,
and
beautiful
eyes
,
that
seem
to
indicate
not
so
much
*NL*
capacity
of
thought
,
as
gentle
and
voluptuous
emotion
.
Of
the
*NL*
possessor
of
such
features
we
shall
have
a
right
to
ask
nothing
,
except
*NL*
that
he
would
take
the
rude
world
easily
,
and
make
himself
happy
in
it
.
*NL*
Can
it
have
been
an
early
lover
of
Miss
Hepzibah
?
No
;
she
never
had
a
*NL*
lover
--
poor
thing
,
how
could
she
?
--
nor
ever
knew
,
by
her
own
*NL*
experience
,
what
love
technically
means
.
And
yet
,
her
undying
faith
*NL*
and
trust
,
her
fresh
remembrance
,
and
continual
devotedness
towards
the
*NL*
original
of
that
miniature
,
have
been
the
only
substance
for
her
heart
*NL*
to
feed
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seems
to
have
put
aside
the
miniature
,
and
is
standing
again
before
*NL*
the
toilet-glass
.
There
are
tears
to
be
wiped
off
.
A
few
more
*NL*
footsteps
to
and
fro
;
and
here
,
at
last
,
--
with
another
pitiful
sigh
,
*NL*
like
a
gust
of
chill
,
damp
wind
out
of
a
long-closed
vault
,
the
door
of
*NL*
which
has
accidentally
been
set
,
ajar
--
here
comes
Miss
Hepzibah
*NL*
Pyncheon
!
Forth
she
steps
into
the
dusky
,
time-darkened
passage
;
a
tall
*NL*
figure
,
clad
in
black
silk
,
with
a
long
and
shrunken
waist
,
feeling
her
*NL*
way
towards
the
stairs
like
a
near-sighted
person
,
as
in
truth
she
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
,
meanwhile
,
if
not
already
above
the
horizon
,
was
ascending
*NL*
nearer
and
nearer
to
its
verge
.
A
few
clouds
,
floating
high
upward
,
*NL*
caught
some
of
the
earliest
light
,
and
threw
down
its
golden
gleam
on
*NL*
the
windows
of
all
the
houses
in
the
street
,
not
forgetting
the
House
*NL*
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
which
--
many
such
sunrises
as
it
had
*NL*
witnessed
--
looked
cheerfully
at
the
present
one
.
The
reflected
*NL*
radiance
served
to
show
,
pretty
distinctly
,
the
aspect
and
arrangement
*NL*
of
the
room
which
Hepzibah
entered
,
after
descending
the
stairs
.
It
*NL*
was
a
low-studded
room
,
with
a
beam
across
the
ceiling
,
panelled
with
*NL*
dark
wood
,
and
having
a
large
chimney-piece
,
set
round
with
pictured
*NL*
tiles
,
but
now
closed
by
an
iron
fire-board
,
through
which
ran
the
*NL*
funnel
of
a
modern
stove
.
There
was
a
carpet
on
the
floor
,
originally
*NL*
of
rich
texture
,
but
so
worn
and
faded
in
these
latter
years
that
its
*NL*
once
brilliant
figure
had
quite
vanished
into
one
indistinguishable
*NL*
hue
.
In
the
way
of
furniture
,
there
were
two
tables
:
one
,
constructed
*NL*
with
perplexing
intricacy
and
exhibiting
as
many
feet
as
a
centipede
;
*NL*
the
other
,
most
delicately
wrought
,
with
four
long
and
slender
legs
,
so
*NL*
apparently
frail
that
it
was
almost
incredible
what
a
length
of
time
*NL*
the
ancient
tea-table
had
stood
upon
them
.
Half
a
dozen
chairs
stood
*NL*
about
the
room
,
straight
and
stiff
,
and
so
ingeniously
contrived
for
*NL*
the
discomfort
of
the
human
person
that
they
were
irksome
even
to
*NL*
sight
,
and
conveyed
the
ugliest
possible
idea
of
the
state
of
society
*NL*
to
which
they
could
have
been
adapted
.
One
exception
there
was
,
*NL*
however
,
in
a
very
antique
elbow-chair
,
with
a
high
back
,
carved
*NL*
elaborately
in
oak
,
and
a
roomy
depth
within
its
arms
,
that
made
up
,
by
*NL*
its
spacious
comprehensiveness
,
for
the
lack
of
any
of
those
artistic
*NL*
curves
which
abound
in
a
modern
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
ornamental
articles
of
furniture
,
we
recollect
but
two
,
if
such
*NL*
they
may
be
called
.
One
was
a
map
of
the
Pyncheon
territory
at
the
*NL*
eastward
,
not
engraved
,
but
the
handiwork
of
some
skilful
old
*NL*
draughtsman
,
and
grotesquely
illuminated
with
pictures
of
Indians
and
*NL*
wild
beasts
,
among
which
was
seen
a
lion
;
the
natural
history
of
the
*NL*
region
being
as
little
known
as
its
geography
,
which
was
put
down
most
*NL*
fantastically
awry
.
The
other
adornment
was
the
portrait
of
old
*NL*
Colonel
Pyncheon
,
at
two
thirds
length
,
representing
the
stern
features
*NL*
of
a
Puritanic-looking
personage
,
in
a
skull-cap
,
with
a
laced
band
and
*NL*
a
grizzly
beard
;
holding
a
Bible
with
one
hand
,
and
in
the
other
*NL*
uplifting
an
iron
sword-hilt
.
The
latter
object
,
being
more
*NL*
successfully
depicted
by
the
artist
,
stood
out
in
far
greater
*NL*
prominence
than
the
sacred
volume
.
Face
to
face
with
this
picture
,
on
*NL*
entering
the
apartment
,
Miss
Hepzibah
Pyncheon
came
to
a
pause
;
*NL*
regarding
it
with
a
singular
scowl
,
a
strange
contortion
of
the
brow
,
*NL*
which
,
by
people
who
did
not
know
her
,
would
probably
have
been
*NL*
interpreted
as
an
expression
of
bitter
anger
and
ill-will
.
But
it
was
*NL*
no
such
thing
.
She
,
in
fact
,
felt
a
reverence
for
the
pictured
visage
,
*NL*
of
which
only
a
far-descended
and
time-stricken
virgin
could
be
*NL*
susceptible
;
and
this
forbidding
scowl
was
the
innocent
result
of
her
*NL*
near-sightedness
,
and
an
effort
so
to
concentrate
her
powers
of
vision
*NL*
as
to
substitute
a
firm
outline
of
the
object
instead
of
a
vague
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
linger
a
moment
on
this
unfortunate
expression
of
poor
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
brow
.
Her
scowl
,
--
as
the
world
,
or
such
part
of
it
as
*NL*
sometimes
caught
a
transitory
glimpse
of
her
at
the
window
,
wickedly
*NL*
persisted
in
calling
it
,
--
her
scowl
had
done
Miss
Hepzibah
a
very
ill
*NL*
office
,
in
establishing
her
character
as
an
ill-tempered
old
maid
;
nor
*NL*
does
it
appear
improbable
that
,
by
often
gazing
at
herself
in
a
dim
*NL*
looking-glass
,
and
perpetually
encountering
her
own
frown
with
its
*NL*
ghostly
sphere
,
she
had
been
led
to
interpret
the
expression
almost
as
*NL*
unjustly
as
the
world
did
.
``
How
miserably
cross
I
look
!
''
she
must
*NL*
often
have
whispered
to
herself
;
and
ultimately
have
fancied
herself
*NL*
so
,
by
a
sense
of
inevitable
doom
.
But
her
heart
never
frowned
.
It
*NL*
was
naturally
tender
,
sensitive
,
and
full
of
little
tremors
and
*NL*
palpitations
;
all
of
which
weaknesses
it
retained
,
while
her
visage
was
*NL*
growing
so
perversely
stern
,
and
even
fierce
.
Nor
had
Hepzibah
ever
*NL*
any
hardihood
,
except
what
came
from
the
very
warmest
nook
in
her
*NL*
affections
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
,
however
,
we
are
loitering
faintheartedly
on
the
*NL*
threshold
of
our
story
.
In
very
truth
,
we
have
an
invincible
*NL*
reluctance
to
disclose
what
Miss
Hepzibah
Pyncheon
was
about
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
already
been
observed
,
that
,
in
the
basement
story
of
the
gable
*NL*
fronting
on
the
street
,
an
unworthy
ancestor
,
nearly
a
century
ago
,
had
*NL*
fitted
up
a
shop
.
Ever
since
the
old
gentleman
retired
from
trade
,
and
*NL*
fell
asleep
under
his
coffin-lid
,
not
only
the
shop-door
,
but
the
inner
*NL*
arrangements
,
had
been
suffered
to
remain
unchanged
;
while
the
dust
of
*NL*
ages
gathered
inch-deep
over
the
shelves
and
counter
,
and
partly
filled
*NL*
an
old
pair
of
scales
,
as
if
it
were
of
value
enough
to
be
weighed
.
It
*NL*
treasured
itself
up
,
too
,
in
the
half-open
till
,
where
there
still
*NL*
lingered
a
base
sixpence
,
worth
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
*NL*
hereditary
pride
which
had
here
been
put
to
shame
.
Such
had
been
the
*NL*
state
and
condition
of
the
little
shop
in
old
Hepzibah
's
childhood
,
*NL*
when
she
and
her
brother
used
to
play
at
hide-and-seek
in
its
forsaken
*NL*
precincts
.
So
it
had
remained
,
until
within
a
few
days
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
,
though
the
shop-window
was
still
closely
curtained
from
the
*NL*
public
gaze
,
a
remarkable
change
had
taken
place
in
its
interior
.
The
*NL*
rich
and
heavy
festoons
of
cobweb
,
which
it
had
cost
a
long
ancestral
*NL*
succession
of
spiders
their
life
's
labor
to
spin
and
weave
,
had
been
*NL*
carefully
brushed
away
from
the
ceiling
.
The
counter
,
shelves
,
and
*NL*
floor
had
all
been
scoured
,
and
the
latter
was
overstrewn
with
fresh
*NL*
blue
sand
.
The
brown
scales
,
too
,
had
evidently
undergone
rigid
*NL*
discipline
,
in
an
unavailing
effort
to
rub
off
the
rust
,
which
,
alas
!
*NL*
had
eaten
through
and
through
their
substance
.
Neither
was
the
little
*NL*
old
shop
any
longer
empty
of
merchantable
goods
.
A
curious
eye
,
*NL*
privileged
to
take
an
account
of
stock
and
investigate
behind
the
*NL*
counter
,
would
have
discovered
a
barrel
,
yea
,
two
or
three
barrels
and
*NL*
half
ditto
,
--
one
containing
flour
,
another
apples
,
and
a
third
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
Indian
meal
.
There
was
likewise
a
square
box
of
pine-wood
,
*NL*
full
of
soap
in
bars
;
also
,
another
of
the
same
size
,
in
which
were
*NL*
tallow
candles
,
ten
to
the
pound
.
A
small
stock
of
brown
sugar
,
some
*NL*
white
beans
and
split
peas
,
and
a
few
other
commodities
of
low
price
,
*NL*
and
such
as
are
constantly
in
demand
,
made
up
the
bulkier
portion
of
*NL*
the
merchandise
.
It
might
have
been
taken
for
a
ghostly
or
*NL*
phantasmagoric
reflection
of
the
old
shop-keeper
Pyncheon
's
shabbily
*NL*
provided
shelves
,
save
that
some
of
the
articles
were
of
a
description
*NL*
and
outward
form
which
could
hardly
have
been
known
in
his
day
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
there
was
a
glass
pickle-jar
,
filled
with
fragments
of
*NL*
Gibraltar
rock
;
not
,
indeed
,
splinters
of
the
veritable
stone
*NL*
foundation
of
the
famous
fortress
,
but
bits
of
delectable
candy
,
neatly
*NL*
done
up
in
white
paper
.
Jim
Crow
,
moreover
,
was
seen
executing
his
*NL*
world-renowned
dance
,
in
gingerbread
.
A
party
of
leaden
dragoons
were
*NL*
galloping
along
one
of
the
shelves
,
in
equipments
and
uniform
of
modern
*NL*
cut
;
and
there
were
some
sugar
figures
,
with
no
strong
resemblance
to
*NL*
the
humanity
of
any
epoch
,
but
less
unsatisfactorily
representing
our
*NL*
own
fashions
than
those
of
a
hundred
years
ago
.
Another
phenomenon
,
*NL*
still
more
strikingly
modern
,
was
a
package
of
lucifer
matches
,
which
,
*NL*
in
old
times
,
would
have
been
thought
actually
to
borrow
their
*NL*
instantaneous
flame
from
the
nether
fires
of
Tophet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
to
bring
the
matter
at
once
to
a
point
,
it
was
*NL*
incontrovertibly
evident
that
somebody
had
taken
the
shop
and
fixtures
*NL*
of
the
long-retired
and
forgotten
Mr.
Pyncheon
,
and
was
about
to
renew
*NL*
the
enterprise
of
that
departed
worthy
,
with
a
different
set
of
*NL*
customers
.
Who
could
this
bold
adventurer
be
?
And
,
of
all
places
in
*NL*
the
world
,
why
had
he
chosen
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
as
the
scene
*NL*
of
his
commercial
speculations
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
return
to
the
elderly
maiden
.
She
at
length
withdrew
her
eyes
from
*NL*
the
dark
countenance
of
the
Colonel
's
portrait
,
heaved
a
sigh
,
--
indeed
,
*NL*
her
breast
was
a
very
cave
of
Aolus
that
morning
,
--
and
stept
across
the
*NL*
room
on
tiptoe
,
as
is
the
customary
gait
of
elderly
women
.
Passing
*NL*
through
an
intervening
passage
,
she
opened
a
door
that
communicated
*NL*
with
the
shop
,
just
now
so
elaborately
described
.
Owing
to
the
*NL*
projection
of
the
upper
story
--
and
still
more
to
the
thick
shadow
of
*NL*
the
Pyncheon
Elm
,
which
stood
almost
directly
in
front
of
the
*NL*
gable
--
the
twilight
,
here
,
was
still
as
much
akin
to
night
as
morning
.
*NL*
Another
heavy
sigh
from
Miss
Hepzibah
!
After
a
moment
's
pause
on
the
*NL*
threshold
,
peering
towards
the
window
with
her
near-sighted
scowl
,
as
*NL*
if
frowning
down
some
bitter
enemy
,
she
suddenly
projected
herself
into
*NL*
the
shop
.
The
haste
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
the
galvanic
impulse
of
the
*NL*
movement
,
were
really
quite
startling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nervously
--
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
,
we
might
almost
say
--
she
began
to
busy
*NL*
herself
in
arranging
some
children
's
playthings
,
and
other
little
*NL*
wares
,
on
the
shelves
and
at
the
shop-window
.
In
the
aspect
of
this
*NL*
dark-arrayed
,
pale-faced
,
ladylike
old
figure
there
was
a
deeply
tragic
*NL*
character
that
contrasted
irreconcilably
with
the
ludicrous
pettiness
*NL*
of
her
employment
.
It
seemed
a
queer
anomaly
,
that
so
gaunt
and
dismal
*NL*
a
personage
should
take
a
toy
in
hand
;
a
miracle
,
that
the
toy
did
not
*NL*
vanish
in
her
grasp
;
a
miserably
absurd
idea
,
that
she
should
go
on
*NL*
perplexing
her
stiff
and
sombre
intellect
with
the
question
how
to
*NL*
tempt
little
boys
into
her
premises
!
Yet
such
is
undoubtedly
her
*NL*
object
.
Now
she
places
a
gingerbread
elephant
against
the
window
,
but
*NL*
with
so
tremulous
a
touch
that
it
tumbles
upon
the
floor
,
with
the
*NL*
dismemberment
of
three
legs
and
its
trunk
;
it
has
ceased
to
be
an
*NL*
elephant
,
and
has
become
a
few
bits
of
musty
gingerbread
.
There
,
*NL*
again
,
she
has
upset
a
tumbler
of
marbles
,
all
of
which
roll
different
*NL*
ways
,
and
each
individual
marble
,
devil-directed
,
into
the
most
*NL*
difficult
obscurity
that
it
can
find
.
Heaven
help
our
poor
old
*NL*
Hepzibah
,
and
forgive
us
for
taking
a
ludicrous
view
of
her
position
!
*NL*
As
her
rigid
and
rusty
frame
goes
down
upon
its
hands
and
knees
,
in
*NL*
quest
of
the
absconding
marbles
,
we
positively
feel
so
much
the
more
*NL*
inclined
to
shed
tears
of
sympathy
,
from
the
very
fact
that
we
must
*NL*
needs
turn
aside
and
laugh
at
her
.
For
here
,
--
and
if
we
fail
to
*NL*
impress
it
suitably
upon
the
reader
,
it
is
our
own
fault
,
not
that
of
*NL*
the
theme
,
here
is
one
of
the
truest
points
of
melancholy
interest
that
*NL*
occur
in
ordinary
life
.
It
was
the
final
throe
of
what
called
itself
*NL*
old
gentility
.
A
lady
--
who
had
fed
herself
from
childhood
with
the
*NL*
shadowy
food
of
aristocratic
reminiscences
,
and
whose
religion
it
was
*NL*
that
a
lady
's
hand
soils
itself
irremediably
by
doing
aught
for
*NL*
bread
,
--
this
born
lady
,
after
sixty
years
of
narrowing
means
,
is
fain
*NL*
to
step
down
from
her
pedestal
of
imaginary
rank
.
Poverty
,
treading
*NL*
closely
at
her
heels
for
a
lifetime
,
has
come
up
with
her
at
last
.
She
*NL*
must
earn
her
own
food
,
or
starve
!
And
we
have
stolen
upon
Miss
*NL*
Hepzibah
Pyncheon
,
too
irreverently
,
at
the
instant
of
time
when
the
*NL*
patrician
lady
is
to
be
transformed
into
the
plebeian
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
republican
country
,
amid
the
fluctuating
waves
of
our
social
*NL*
life
,
somebody
is
always
at
the
drowning-point
.
The
tragedy
is
enacted
*NL*
with
as
continual
a
repetition
as
that
of
a
popular
drama
on
a
holiday
,
*NL*
and
,
nevertheless
,
is
felt
as
deeply
,
perhaps
,
as
when
an
hereditary
*NL*
noble
sinks
below
his
order
.
More
deeply
;
since
,
with
us
,
rank
is
the
*NL*
grosser
substance
of
wealth
and
a
splendid
establishment
,
and
has
no
*NL*
spiritual
existence
after
the
death
of
these
,
but
dies
hopelessly
along
*NL*
with
them
.
And
,
therefore
,
since
we
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
*NL*
introduce
our
heroine
at
so
inauspicious
a
juncture
,
we
would
entreat
*NL*
for
a
mood
of
due
solemnity
in
the
spectators
of
her
fate
.
Let
us
*NL*
behold
,
in
poor
Hepzibah
,
the
immemorial
,
lady
--
two
hundred
years
old
,
*NL*
on
this
side
of
the
water
,
and
thrice
as
many
on
the
other
,
--
with
her
*NL*
antique
portraits
,
pedigrees
,
coats
of
arms
,
records
and
traditions
,
*NL*
and
her
claim
,
as
joint
heiress
,
to
that
princely
territory
at
the
*NL*
eastward
,
no
longer
a
wilderness
,
but
a
populous
fertility
,
--
born
,
too
,
*NL*
in
Pyncheon
Street
,
under
the
Pyncheon
Elm
,
and
in
the
Pyncheon
House
,
*NL*
where
she
has
spent
all
her
days
,
--
reduced
.
Now
,
in
that
very
house
,
*NL*
to
be
the
hucksteress
of
a
cent-shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
business
of
setting
up
a
petty
shop
is
almost
the
only
resource
of
*NL*
women
,
in
circumstances
at
all
similar
to
those
of
our
unfortunate
*NL*
recluse
.
With
her
near-sightedness
,
and
those
tremulous
fingers
of
*NL*
hers
,
at
once
inflexible
and
delicate
,
she
could
not
be
a
seamstress
;
*NL*
although
her
sampler
,
of
fifty
years
gone
by
,
exhibited
some
of
the
*NL*
most
recondite
specimens
of
ornamental
needlework
.
A
school
for
little
*NL*
children
had
been
often
in
her
thoughts
;
and
,
at
one
time
,
she
had
*NL*
begun
a
review
of
her
early
studies
in
the
New
England
Primer
,
with
a
*NL*
view
to
prepare
herself
for
the
office
of
instructress
.
But
the
love
*NL*
of
children
had
never
been
quickened
in
Hepzibah
's
heart
,
and
was
now
*NL*
torpid
,
if
not
extinct
;
she
watched
the
little
people
of
the
*NL*
neighborhood
from
her
chamber-window
,
and
doubted
whether
she
could
*NL*
tolerate
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
them
.
Besides
,
in
our
day
,
*NL*
the
very
ABC
has
become
a
science
greatly
too
abstruse
to
be
any
longer
*NL*
taught
by
pointing
a
pin
from
letter
to
letter
.
A
modern
child
could
*NL*
teach
old
Hepzibah
more
than
old
Hepzibah
could
teach
the
child
.
*NL*
So
--
with
many
a
cold
,
deep
heart-quake
at
the
idea
of
at
last
coming
*NL*
into
sordid
contact
with
the
world
,
from
which
she
had
so
long
kept
*NL*
aloof
,
while
every
added
day
of
seclusion
had
rolled
another
stone
*NL*
against
the
cavern
door
of
her
hermitage
--
the
poor
thing
bethought
*NL*
herself
of
the
ancient
shop-window
,
the
rusty
scales
,
and
dusty
till
.
*NL*
She
might
have
held
back
a
little
longer
;
but
another
circumstance
,
not
*NL*
yet
hinted
at
,
had
somewhat
hastened
her
decision
.
Her
humble
*NL*
preparations
,
therefore
,
were
duly
made
,
and
the
enterprise
was
now
to
*NL*
be
commenced
.
Nor
was
she
entitled
to
complain
of
any
remarkable
*NL*
singularity
in
her
fate
;
for
,
in
the
town
of
her
nativity
,
we
might
*NL*
point
to
several
little
shops
of
a
similar
description
,
some
of
them
in
*NL*
houses
as
ancient
as
that
of
the
Seven
Gables
;
and
one
or
two
,
it
may
*NL*
be
,
where
a
decayed
gentlewoman
stands
behind
the
counter
,
as
grim
an
*NL*
image
of
family
pride
as
Miss
Hepzibah
Pyncheon
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
overpoweringly
ridiculous
,
--
we
must
honestly
confess
it
,
--
the
*NL*
deportment
of
the
maiden
lady
while
setting
her
shop
in
order
for
the
*NL*
public
eye
.
She
stole
on
tiptoe
to
the
window
,
as
cautiously
as
if
she
*NL*
conceived
some
bloody-minded
villain
to
be
watching
behind
the
*NL*
elm-tree
,
with
intent
to
take
her
life
.
Stretching
out
her
long
,
lank
*NL*
arm
,
she
put
a
paper
of
pearl-buttons
,
a
jew
's
-
harp
,
or
whatever
the
*NL*
small
article
might
be
,
in
its
destined
place
,
and
straightway
vanished
*NL*
back
into
the
dusk
,
as
if
the
world
need
never
hope
for
another
glimpse
*NL*
of
her
.
It
might
have
been
fancied
,
indeed
,
that
she
expected
to
*NL*
minister
to
the
wants
of
the
community
unseen
,
like
a
disembodied
*NL*
divinity
or
enchantress
,
holding
forth
her
bargains
to
the
reverential
*NL*
and
awe-stricken
purchaser
in
an
invisible
hand
.
But
Hepzibah
had
no
*NL*
such
flattering
dream
.
She
was
well
aware
that
she
must
ultimately
come
*NL*
forward
,
and
stand
revealed
in
her
proper
individuality
;
but
,
like
*NL*
other
sensitive
persons
,
she
could
not
bear
to
be
observed
in
the
*NL*
gradual
process
,
and
chose
rather
to
flash
forth
on
the
world
's
*NL*
astonished
gaze
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inevitable
moment
was
not
much
longer
to
be
delayed
.
The
sunshine
*NL*
might
now
be
seen
stealing
down
the
front
of
the
opposite
house
,
from
*NL*
the
windows
of
which
came
a
reflected
gleam
,
struggling
through
the
*NL*
boughs
of
the
elm-tree
,
and
enlightening
the
interior
of
the
shop
more
*NL*
distinctly
than
heretofore
.
The
town
appeared
to
be
waking
up
.
A
*NL*
baker
's
cart
had
already
rattled
through
the
street
,
chasing
away
the
*NL*
latest
vestige
of
night
's
sanctity
with
the
jingle-jangle
of
its
*NL*
dissonant
bells
.
A
milkman
was
distributing
the
contents
of
his
cans
*NL*
from
door
to
door
;
and
the
harsh
peal
of
a
fisherman
's
conch
shell
was
*NL*
heard
far
off
,
around
the
corner
.
None
of
these
tokens
escaped
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
notice
.
The
moment
had
arrived
.
To
delay
longer
would
be
*NL*
only
to
lengthen
out
her
misery
.
Nothing
remained
,
except
to
take
down
*NL*
the
bar
from
the
shop-door
,
leaving
the
entrance
free
--
more
than
*NL*
free
--
welcome
,
as
if
all
were
household
friends
--
to
every
passer-by
,
*NL*
whose
eyes
might
be
attracted
by
the
commodities
at
the
window
.
This
*NL*
last
act
Hepzibah
now
performed
,
letting
the
bar
fall
with
what
smote
*NL*
upon
her
excited
nerves
as
a
most
astounding
clatter
.
Then
--
as
if
the
*NL*
only
barrier
betwixt
herself
and
the
world
had
been
thrown
down
,
and
a
*NL*
flood
of
evil
consequences
would
come
tumbling
through
the
gap
--
she
*NL*
fled
into
the
inner
parlor
,
threw
herself
into
the
ancestral
*NL*
elbow-chair
,
and
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
miserable
old
Hepzibah
!
It
is
a
heavy
annoyance
to
a
writer
,
who
*NL*
endeavors
to
represent
nature
,
its
various
attitudes
and
circumstances
,
*NL*
in
a
reasonably
correct
outline
and
true
coloring
,
that
so
much
of
the
*NL*
mean
and
ludicrous
should
be
hopelessly
mixed
up
with
the
purest
pathos
*NL*
which
life
anywhere
supplies
to
him
.
What
tragic
dignity
,
for
example
,
*NL*
can
be
wrought
into
a
scene
like
this
!
How
can
we
elevate
our
history
*NL*
of
retribution
for
the
sin
of
long
ago
,
when
,
as
one
of
our
most
*NL*
prominent
figures
,
we
are
compelled
to
introduce
--
not
a
young
and
*NL*
lovely
woman
,
nor
even
the
stately
remains
of
beauty
,
storm-shattered
*NL*
by
affliction
--
but
a
gaunt
,
sallow
,
rusty-jointed
maiden
,
in
a
*NL*
long-waisted
silk
gown
,
and
with
the
strange
horror
of
a
turban
on
her
*NL*
head
!
Her
visage
is
not
even
ugly
.
It
is
redeemed
from
insignificance
*NL*
only
by
the
contraction
of
her
eyebrows
into
a
near-sighted
scowl
.
*NL*
And
,
finally
,
her
great
life-trial
seems
to
be
,
that
,
after
sixty
years
*NL*
of
idleness
,
she
finds
it
convenient
to
earn
comfortable
bread
by
*NL*
setting
up
a
shop
in
a
small
way
.
Nevertheless
,
if
we
look
through
all
*NL*
the
heroic
fortunes
of
mankind
,
we
shall
find
this
same
entanglement
of
*NL*
something
mean
and
trivial
with
whatever
is
noblest
in
joy
or
sorrow
.
*NL*
Life
is
made
up
of
marble
and
mud
.
And
,
without
all
the
deeper
trust
*NL*
in
a
comprehensive
sympathy
above
us
,
we
might
hence
be
led
to
suspect
*NL*
the
insult
of
a
sneer
,
as
well
as
an
immitigable
frown
,
on
the
iron
*NL*
countenance
of
fate
.
What
is
called
poetic
insight
is
the
gift
of
*NL*
discerning
,
in
this
sphere
of
strangely
mingled
elements
,
the
beauty
*NL*
and
the
majesty
which
are
compelled
to
assume
a
garb
so
sordid
.

III
The
First
Customer
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MISS
HEPZIBAH
PYNCHEON
sat
in
the
oaken
elbow-chair
,
with
her
hands
*NL*
over
her
face
,
giving
way
to
that
heavy
down-sinking
of
the
heart
which
*NL*
most
persons
have
experienced
,
when
the
image
of
hope
itself
seems
*NL*
ponderously
moulded
of
lead
,
on
the
eve
of
an
enterprise
at
once
*NL*
doubtful
and
momentous
.
She
was
suddenly
startled
by
the
tinkling
*NL*
alarum
--
high
,
sharp
,
and
irregular
--
of
a
little
bell
.
The
maiden
lady
*NL*
arose
upon
her
feet
,
as
pale
as
a
ghost
at
cock-crow
;
for
she
was
an
*NL*
enslaved
spirit
,
and
this
the
talisman
to
which
she
owed
obedience
.
*NL*
This
little
bell
,
--
to
speak
in
plainer
terms
,
--
being
fastened
over
the
*NL*
shop-door
,
was
so
contrived
as
to
vibrate
by
means
of
a
steel
spring
,
*NL*
and
thus
convey
notice
to
the
inner
regions
of
the
house
when
any
*NL*
customer
should
cross
the
threshold
.
Its
ugly
and
spiteful
little
din
*NL*
-LRB-
heard
now
for
the
first
time
,
perhaps
,
since
Hepzibah
's
periwigged
*NL*
predecessor
had
retired
from
trade
-RRB-
at
once
set
every
nerve
of
her
body
*NL*
in
responsive
and
tumultuous
vibration
.
The
crisis
was
upon
her
!
Her
*NL*
first
customer
was
at
the
door
!
*NL*
*NL*
Without
giving
herself
time
for
a
second
thought
,
she
rushed
into
the
*NL*
shop
,
pale
,
wild
,
desperate
in
gesture
and
expression
,
scowling
*NL*
portentously
,
and
looking
far
better
qualified
to
do
fierce
battle
with
*NL*
a
housebreaker
than
to
stand
smiling
behind
the
counter
,
bartering
*NL*
small
wares
for
a
copper
recompense
.
Any
ordinary
customer
,
indeed
,
*NL*
would
have
turned
his
back
and
fled
.
And
yet
there
was
nothing
fierce
*NL*
in
Hepzibah
's
poor
old
heart
;
nor
had
she
,
at
the
moment
,
a
single
*NL*
bitter
thought
against
the
world
at
large
,
or
one
individual
man
or
*NL*
woman
.
She
wished
them
all
well
,
but
wished
,
too
,
that
she
herself
*NL*
were
done
with
them
,
and
in
her
quiet
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
applicant
,
by
this
time
,
stood
within
the
doorway
.
Coming
freshly
,
*NL*
as
he
did
,
out
of
the
morning
light
,
he
appeared
to
have
brought
some
*NL*
of
its
cheery
influences
into
the
shop
along
with
him
.
It
was
a
*NL*
slender
young
man
,
not
more
than
one
or
two
and
twenty
years
old
,
with
*NL*
rather
a
grave
and
thoughtful
expression
for
his
years
,
but
likewise
a
*NL*
springy
alacrity
and
vigor
.
These
qualities
were
not
only
perceptible
,
*NL*
physically
,
in
his
make
and
motions
,
but
made
themselves
felt
almost
*NL*
immediately
in
his
character
.
A
brown
beard
,
not
too
silken
in
its
*NL*
texture
,
fringed
his
chin
,
but
as
yet
without
completely
hiding
it
;
he
*NL*
wore
a
short
mustache
,
too
,
and
his
dark
,
high-featured
countenance
*NL*
looked
all
the
better
for
these
natural
ornaments
.
As
for
his
dress
,
*NL*
it
was
of
the
simplest
kind
;
a
summer
sack
of
cheap
and
ordinary
*NL*
material
,
thin
checkered
pantaloons
,
and
a
straw
hat
,
by
no
means
of
*NL*
the
finest
braid
.
Oak
Hall
might
have
supplied
his
entire
equipment
.
*NL*
He
was
chiefly
marked
as
a
gentleman
--
if
such
,
indeed
,
he
made
any
*NL*
claim
to
be
--
by
the
rather
remarkable
whiteness
and
nicety
of
his
clean
*NL*
linen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
met
the
scowl
of
old
Hepzibah
without
apparent
alarm
,
as
having
*NL*
heretofore
encountered
it
and
found
it
harmless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
my
dear
Miss
Pyncheon
,
''
said
the
daguerreotypist
,
--
for
it
was
that
*NL*
sole
other
occupant
of
the
seven-gabled
mansion
,
--
``
I
am
glad
to
see
*NL*
that
you
have
not
shrunk
from
your
good
purpose
.
I
merely
look
in
to
*NL*
offer
my
best
wishes
,
and
to
ask
if
I
can
assist
you
any
further
in
*NL*
your
preparations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
People
in
difficulty
and
distress
,
or
in
any
manner
at
odds
with
the
*NL*
world
,
can
endure
a
vast
amount
of
harsh
treatment
,
and
perhaps
be
only
*NL*
the
stronger
for
it
;
whereas
they
give
way
at
once
before
the
simplest
*NL*
expression
of
what
they
perceive
to
be
genuine
sympathy
.
So
it
proved
*NL*
with
poor
Hepzibah
;
for
,
when
she
saw
the
young
man
's
smile
,
--
looking
*NL*
so
much
the
brighter
on
a
thoughtful
face
,
--
and
heard
his
kindly
tone
,
*NL*
she
broke
first
into
a
hysteric
giggle
and
then
began
to
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Mr.
Holgrave
,
''
cried
she
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
,
``
I
never
can
*NL*
go
through
with
it
!
Never
,
never
,
never
!
I
wish
I
were
dead
,
and
in
the
*NL*
old
family
tomb
,
with
all
my
forefathers
!
With
my
father
,
and
my
*NL*
mother
,
and
my
sister
!
Yes
,
and
with
my
brother
,
who
had
far
better
*NL*
find
me
there
than
here
!
The
world
is
too
chill
and
hard
,
--
and
I
am
too
*NL*
old
,
and
too
feeble
,
and
too
hopeless
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
believe
me
,
Miss
Hepzibah
,
''
said
the
young
man
quietly
,
``
these
*NL*
feelings
will
not
trouble
you
any
longer
,
after
you
are
once
fairly
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
your
enterprise
.
They
are
unavoidable
at
this
moment
,
*NL*
standing
,
as
you
do
,
on
the
outer
verge
of
your
long
seclusion
,
and
*NL*
peopling
the
world
with
ugly
shapes
,
which
you
will
soon
find
to
be
as
*NL*
unreal
as
the
giants
and
ogres
of
a
child
's
story-book
.
I
find
nothing
*NL*
so
singular
in
life
,
as
that
everything
appears
to
lose
its
substance
*NL*
the
instant
one
actually
grapples
with
it
.
So
it
will
be
with
what
you
*NL*
think
so
terrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
a
woman
!
''
said
Hepzibah
piteously
.
``
I
was
going
to
say
,
a
*NL*
lady
,
--
but
I
consider
that
as
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
;
no
matter
if
it
be
past
!
''
answered
the
artist
,
a
strange
gleam
*NL*
of
half-hidden
sarcasm
flashing
through
the
kindliness
of
his
manner
.
*NL*
``
Let
it
go
!
You
are
the
better
without
it
.
I
speak
frankly
,
my
dear
*NL*
Miss
Pyncheon
!
--
for
are
we
not
friends
?
I
look
upon
this
as
one
of
the
*NL*
fortunate
days
of
your
life
.
It
ends
an
epoch
and
begins
one
.
*NL*
Hitherto
,
the
life-blood
has
been
gradually
chilling
in
your
veins
as
*NL*
you
sat
aloof
,
within
your
circle
of
gentility
,
while
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
world
was
fighting
out
its
battle
with
one
kind
of
necessity
or
*NL*
another
.
Henceforth
,
you
will
at
least
have
the
sense
of
healthy
and
*NL*
natural
effort
for
a
purpose
,
and
of
lending
your
strength
be
it
great
*NL*
or
small
--
to
the
united
struggle
of
mankind
.
This
is
success
,
--
all
the
*NL*
success
that
anybody
meets
with
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
natural
enough
,
Mr.
Holgrave
,
that
you
should
have
ideas
like
*NL*
these
,
''
rejoined
Hepzibah
,
drawing
up
her
gaunt
figure
with
slightly
*NL*
offended
dignity
.
``
You
are
a
man
,
a
young
man
,
and
brought
up
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
as
almost
everybody
is
nowadays
,
with
a
view
to
seeking
your
*NL*
fortune
.
But
I
was
born
a
lady
,
and
have
always
lived
one
;
no
matter
*NL*
in
what
narrowness
of
means
,
always
a
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
was
not
born
a
gentleman
;
neither
have
I
lived
like
one
,
''
said
*NL*
Holgrave
,
slightly
smiling
;
``
so
,
my
dear
madam
,
you
will
hardly
expect
*NL*
me
to
sympathize
with
sensibilities
of
this
kind
;
though
,
unless
I
*NL*
deceive
myself
,
I
have
some
imperfect
comprehension
of
them
.
These
*NL*
names
of
gentleman
and
lady
had
a
meaning
,
in
the
past
history
of
the
*NL*
world
,
and
conferred
privileges
,
desirable
or
otherwise
,
on
those
*NL*
entitled
to
bear
them
.
In
the
present
--
and
still
more
in
the
future
*NL*
condition
of
society-they
imply
,
not
privilege
,
but
restriction
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
new
notions
,
''
said
the
old
gentlewoman
,
shaking
her
head
.
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
understand
them
;
neither
do
I
wish
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
cease
to
speak
of
them
,
then
,
''
replied
the
artist
,
with
a
*NL*
friendlier
smile
than
his
last
one
,
``
and
I
will
leave
you
to
feel
*NL*
whether
it
is
not
better
to
be
a
true
woman
than
a
lady
.
Do
you
really
*NL*
think
,
Miss
Hepzibah
,
that
any
lady
of
your
family
has
ever
done
a
more
*NL*
heroic
thing
,
since
this
house
was
built
,
than
you
are
performing
in
it
*NL*
to-day
?
Never
;
and
if
the
Pyncheons
had
always
acted
so
nobly
,
I
doubt
*NL*
whether
an
old
wizard
Maule
's
anathema
,
of
which
you
told
me
once
,
*NL*
would
have
had
much
weight
with
Providence
against
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
--
no
,
no
!
''
said
Hepzibah
,
not
displeased
at
this
allusion
to
the
*NL*
sombre
dignity
of
an
inherited
curse
.
``
If
old
Maule
's
ghost
,
or
a
*NL*
descendant
of
his
,
could
see
me
behind
the
counter
to-day
,
he
would
*NL*
call
it
the
fulfillment
of
his
worst
wishes
.
But
I
thank
you
for
your
*NL*
kindness
,
Mr.
Holgrave
,
and
will
do
my
utmost
to
be
a
good
shop-keeper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
do
''
said
Holgrave
,
``
and
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
being
your
*NL*
first
customer
.
I
am
about
taking
a
walk
to
the
seashore
,
before
going
*NL*
to
my
rooms
,
where
I
misuse
Heaven
's
blessed
sunshine
by
tracing
out
*NL*
human
features
through
its
agency
.
A
few
of
those
biscuits
,
dipt
in
*NL*
sea-water
,
will
be
just
what
I
need
for
breakfast
.
What
is
the
price
*NL*
of
half
a
dozen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
be
a
lady
a
moment
longer
,
''
replied
Hepzibah
,
with
a
manner
of
*NL*
antique
stateliness
to
which
a
melancholy
smile
lent
a
kind
of
grace
.
*NL*
She
put
the
biscuits
into
his
hand
,
but
rejected
the
compensation
.
``
A
*NL*
Pyncheon
must
not
,
at
all
events
under
her
forefathers
'
roof
,
receive
*NL*
money
for
a
morsel
of
bread
from
her
only
friend
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Holgrave
took
his
departure
,
leaving
her
,
for
the
moment
,
with
spirits
*NL*
not
quite
so
much
depressed
.
Soon
,
however
,
they
had
subsided
nearly
*NL*
to
their
former
dead
level
.
With
a
beating
heart
,
she
listened
to
the
*NL*
footsteps
of
early
passengers
,
which
now
began
to
be
frequent
along
the
*NL*
street
.
Once
or
twice
they
seemed
to
linger
;
these
strangers
,
or
*NL*
neighbors
,
as
the
case
might
be
,
were
looking
at
the
display
of
toys
*NL*
and
petty
commodities
in
Hepzibah
's
shop-window
.
She
was
doubly
*NL*
tortured
;
in
part
,
with
a
sense
of
overwhelming
shame
that
strange
and
*NL*
unloving
eyes
should
have
the
privilege
of
gazing
,
and
partly
because
*NL*
the
idea
occurred
to
her
,
with
ridiculous
importunity
,
that
the
window
*NL*
was
not
arranged
so
skilfully
,
nor
nearly
to
so
much
advantage
,
as
it
*NL*
might
have
been
.
It
seemed
as
if
the
whole
fortune
or
failure
of
her
*NL*
shop
might
depend
on
the
display
of
a
different
set
of
articles
,
or
*NL*
substituting
a
fairer
apple
for
one
which
appeared
to
be
specked
.
So
*NL*
she
made
the
change
,
and
straightway
fancied
that
everything
was
*NL*
spoiled
by
it
;
not
recognizing
that
it
was
the
nervousness
of
the
*NL*
juncture
,
and
her
own
native
squeamishness
as
an
old
maid
,
that
wrought
*NL*
all
the
seeming
mischief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anon
,
there
was
an
encounter
,
just
at
the
door-step
,
betwixt
two
*NL*
laboring
men
,
as
their
rough
voices
denoted
them
to
be
.
After
some
*NL*
slight
talk
about
their
own
affairs
,
one
of
them
chanced
to
notice
the
*NL*
shop-window
,
and
directed
the
other
's
attention
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
!
''
cried
he
;
``
what
do
you
think
of
this
?
Trade
seems
to
be
*NL*
looking
up
in
Pyncheon
Street
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
this
is
a
sight
,
to
be
sure
!
''
exclaimed
the
other
.
``
In
*NL*
the
old
Pyncheon
House
,
and
underneath
the
Pyncheon
Elm
!
Who
would
have
*NL*
thought
it
?
Old
Maid
Pyncheon
is
setting
up
a
cent-shop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
she
make
it
go
,
think
you
,
Dixey
?
''
said
his
friend
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
call
it
a
very
good
stand
.
There
's
another
shop
just
round
the
corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
it
go
!
''
cried
Dixey
,
with
a
most
contemptuous
expression
,
as
if
*NL*
the
very
idea
were
impossible
to
be
conceived
.
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
!
Why
,
*NL*
her
face
--
I
've
seen
it
,
for
I
dug
her
garden
for
her
one
year
--
her
face
*NL*
is
enough
to
frighten
the
Old
Nick
himself
,
if
he
had
ever
so
great
a
*NL*
mind
to
trade
with
her
.
People
ca
n't
stand
it
,
I
tell
you
!
She
scowls
*NL*
dreadfully
,
reason
or
none
,
out
of
pure
ugliness
of
temper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
not
so
much
matter
,
''
remarked
the
other
man
.
``
These
*NL*
sour-tempered
folks
are
mostly
handy
at
business
,
and
know
pretty
well
*NL*
what
they
are
about
.
But
,
as
you
say
,
I
do
n't
think
she
'll
do
much
.
*NL*
This
business
of
keeping
cent-shops
is
overdone
,
like
all
other
kinds
*NL*
of
trade
,
handicraft
,
and
bodily
labor
.
I
know
it
,
to
my
cost
!
My
wife
*NL*
kept
a
cent-shop
three
months
,
and
lost
five
dollars
on
her
outlay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
business
!
''
responded
Dixey
,
in
a
tone
as
if
he
were
shaking
his
*NL*
head
,
--
``
poor
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
reason
or
other
,
not
very
easy
to
analyze
,
there
had
hardly
*NL*
been
so
bitter
a
pang
in
all
her
previous
misery
about
the
matter
as
*NL*
what
thrilled
Hepzibah
's
heart
on
overhearing
the
above
conversation
.
*NL*
The
testimony
in
regard
to
her
scowl
was
frightfully
important
;
it
*NL*
seemed
to
hold
up
her
image
wholly
relieved
from
the
false
light
of
her
*NL*
self-partialities
,
and
so
hideous
that
she
dared
not
look
at
it
.
She
*NL*
was
absurdly
hurt
,
moreover
,
by
the
slight
and
idle
effect
that
her
*NL*
setting
up
shop
--
an
event
of
such
breathless
interest
to
*NL*
herself
--
appeared
to
have
upon
the
public
,
of
which
these
two
men
were
*NL*
the
nearest
representatives
.
A
glance
;
a
passing
word
or
two
;
a
coarse
*NL*
laugh
;
and
she
was
doubtless
forgotten
before
they
turned
the
corner
.
*NL*
They
cared
nothing
for
her
dignity
,
and
just
as
little
for
her
*NL*
degradation
.
Then
,
also
,
the
augury
of
ill-success
,
uttered
from
the
*NL*
sure
wisdom
of
experience
,
fell
upon
her
half-dead
hope
like
a
clod
*NL*
into
a
grave
.
The
man
's
wife
had
already
tried
the
same
experiment
,
*NL*
and
failed
!
How
could
the
born
lady
--
the
recluse
of
half
a
lifetime
,
*NL*
utterly
unpractised
in
the
world
,
at
sixty
years
of
age
,
--
how
could
she
*NL*
ever
dream
of
succeeding
,
when
the
hard
,
vulgar
,
keen
,
busy
,
hackneyed
*NL*
New
England
woman
had
lost
five
dollars
on
her
little
outlay
!
Success
*NL*
presented
itself
as
an
impossibility
,
and
the
hope
of
it
as
a
wild
*NL*
hallucination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
malevolent
spirit
,
doing
his
utmost
to
drive
Hepzibah
mad
,
*NL*
unrolled
before
her
imagination
a
kind
of
panorama
,
representing
the
*NL*
great
thoroughfare
of
a
city
all
astir
with
customers
.
So
many
and
so
*NL*
magnificent
shops
as
there
were
!
Groceries
,
toy-shops
,
drygoods
stores
,
*NL*
with
their
immense
panes
of
plate-glass
,
their
gorgeous
fixtures
,
their
*NL*
vast
and
complete
assortments
of
merchandise
,
in
which
fortunes
had
*NL*
been
invested
;
and
those
noble
mirrors
at
the
farther
end
of
each
*NL*
establishment
,
doubling
all
this
wealth
by
a
brightly
burnished
vista
*NL*
of
unrealities
!
On
one
side
of
the
street
this
splendid
bazaar
,
with
a
*NL*
multitude
of
perfumed
and
glossy
salesmen
,
smirking
,
smiling
,
bowing
,
*NL*
and
measuring
out
the
goods
.
On
the
other
,
the
dusky
old
House
of
the
*NL*
Seven
Gables
,
with
the
antiquated
shop-window
under
its
projecting
*NL*
story
,
and
Hepzibah
herself
,
in
a
gown
of
rusty
black
silk
,
behind
the
*NL*
counter
,
scowling
at
the
world
as
it
went
by
!
This
mighty
contrast
*NL*
thrust
itself
forward
as
a
fair
expression
of
the
odds
against
which
*NL*
she
was
to
begin
her
struggle
for
a
subsistence
.
Success
?
*NL*
Preposterous
!
She
would
never
think
of
it
again
!
The
house
might
just
*NL*
as
well
be
buried
in
an
eternal
fog
while
all
other
houses
had
the
*NL*
sunshine
on
them
;
for
not
a
foot
would
ever
cross
the
threshold
,
nor
a
*NL*
hand
so
much
as
try
the
door
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
at
this
instant
,
the
shop-bell
,
right
over
her
head
,
tinkled
as
if
*NL*
it
were
bewitched
.
The
old
gentlewoman
's
heart
seemed
to
be
attached
*NL*
to
the
same
steel
spring
,
for
it
went
through
a
series
of
sharp
jerks
,
*NL*
in
unison
with
the
sound
.
The
door
was
thrust
open
,
although
no
human
*NL*
form
was
perceptible
on
the
other
side
of
the
half-window
.
Hepzibah
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
stood
at
a
gaze
,
with
her
hands
clasped
,
looking
very
*NL*
much
as
if
she
had
summoned
up
an
evil
spirit
,
and
were
afraid
,
yet
*NL*
resolved
,
to
hazard
the
encounter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
help
me
!
''
she
groaned
mentally
.
``
Now
is
my
hour
of
need
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
,
which
moved
with
difficulty
on
its
creaking
and
rusty
hinges
,
*NL*
being
forced
quite
open
,
a
square
and
sturdy
little
urchin
became
*NL*
apparent
,
with
cheeks
as
red
as
an
apple
.
He
was
clad
rather
shabbily
*NL*
-LRB-
but
,
as
it
seemed
,
more
owing
to
his
mother
's
carelessness
than
his
*NL*
father
's
poverty
-RRB-
,
in
a
blue
apron
,
very
wide
and
short
trousers
,
shoes
*NL*
somewhat
out
at
the
toes
,
and
a
chip
hat
,
with
the
frizzles
of
his
*NL*
curly
hair
sticking
through
its
crevices
.
A
book
and
a
small
slate
,
*NL*
under
his
arm
,
indicated
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
school
.
He
stared
*NL*
at
Hepzibah
a
moment
,
as
an
elder
customer
than
himself
would
have
been
*NL*
likely
enough
to
do
,
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
the
tragic
attitude
*NL*
and
queer
scowl
wherewith
she
regarded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
child
,
''
said
she
,
taking
heart
at
sight
of
a
personage
so
little
*NL*
formidable
,
--
``
well
,
my
child
,
what
did
you
wish
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Jim
Crow
there
in
the
window
,
''
answered
the
urchin
,
holding
out
a
*NL*
cent
,
and
pointing
to
the
gingerbread
figure
that
had
attracted
his
*NL*
notice
,
as
he
loitered
along
to
school
;
``
the
one
that
has
not
a
broken
*NL*
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Hepzibah
put
forth
her
lank
arm
,
and
,
taking
the
effigy
from
the
*NL*
shop-window
,
delivered
it
to
her
first
customer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
for
the
money
,
''
said
she
,
giving
him
a
little
push
towards
*NL*
the
door
;
for
her
old
gentility
was
contumaciously
squeamish
at
sight
*NL*
of
the
copper
coin
,
and
,
besides
,
it
seemed
such
pitiful
meanness
to
*NL*
take
the
child
's
pocket-money
in
exchange
for
a
bit
of
stale
*NL*
gingerbread
.
``
No
matter
for
the
cent
.
You
are
welcome
to
Jim
Crow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
,
staring
with
round
eyes
at
this
instance
of
liberality
,
*NL*
wholly
unprecedented
in
his
large
experience
of
cent-shops
,
took
the
*NL*
man
of
gingerbread
,
and
quitted
the
premises
.
No
sooner
had
he
reached
*NL*
the
sidewalk
-LRB-
little
cannibal
that
he
was
!
-RRB-
than
Jim
Crow
's
head
was
in
*NL*
his
mouth
.
As
he
had
not
been
careful
to
shut
the
door
,
Hepzibah
was
*NL*
at
the
pains
of
closing
it
after
him
,
with
a
pettish
ejaculation
or
two
*NL*
about
the
troublesomeness
of
young
people
,
and
particularly
of
small
*NL*
boys
.
She
had
just
placed
another
representative
of
the
renowned
Jim
*NL*
Crow
at
the
window
,
when
again
the
shop-bell
tinkled
clamorously
,
and
*NL*
again
the
door
being
thrust
open
,
with
its
characteristic
jerk
and
jar
,
*NL*
disclosed
the
same
sturdy
little
urchin
who
,
precisely
two
minutes
ago
,
*NL*
had
made
his
exit
.
The
crumbs
and
discoloration
of
the
cannibal
feast
,
*NL*
as
yet
hardly
consummated
,
were
exceedingly
visible
about
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
now
,
child
?
''
asked
the
maiden
lady
rather
impatiently
;
``
did
*NL*
you
come
back
to
shut
the
door
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
the
urchin
,
pointing
to
the
figure
that
had
just
been
*NL*
put
up
;
``
I
want
that
other
Jim
Crow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
it
is
for
you
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
reaching
it
down
;
but
*NL*
recognizing
that
this
pertinacious
customer
would
not
quit
her
on
any
*NL*
other
terms
,
so
long
as
she
had
a
gingerbread
figure
in
her
shop
,
she
*NL*
partly
drew
back
her
extended
hand
,
``
Where
is
the
cent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
boy
had
the
cent
ready
,
but
,
like
a
true-born
Yankee
,
would
*NL*
have
preferred
the
better
bargain
to
the
worse
.
Looking
somewhat
*NL*
chagrined
,
he
put
the
coin
into
Hepzibah
's
hand
,
and
departed
,
sending
*NL*
the
second
Jim
Crow
in
quest
of
the
former
one
.
The
new
shop-keeper
*NL*
dropped
the
first
solid
result
of
her
commercial
enterprise
into
the
*NL*
till
.
It
was
done
!
The
sordid
stain
of
that
copper
coin
could
never
be
*NL*
washed
away
from
her
palm
.
The
little
schoolboy
,
aided
by
the
impish
*NL*
figure
of
the
negro
dancer
,
had
wrought
an
irreparable
ruin
.
The
*NL*
structure
of
ancient
aristocracy
had
been
demolished
by
him
,
even
as
if
*NL*
his
childish
gripe
had
torn
down
the
seven-gabled
mansion
.
Now
let
*NL*
Hepzibah
turn
the
old
Pyncheon
portraits
with
their
faces
to
the
wall
,
*NL*
and
take
the
map
of
her
Eastern
territory
to
kindle
the
kitchen
fire
,
*NL*
and
blow
up
the
flame
with
the
empty
breath
of
her
ancestral
*NL*
traditions
!
What
had
she
to
do
with
ancestry
?
Nothing
;
no
more
than
*NL*
with
posterity
!
No
lady
,
now
,
but
simply
Hepzibah
Pyncheon
,
a
forlorn
*NL*
old
maid
,
and
keeper
of
a
cent-shop
!
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
even
while
she
paraded
these
ideas
somewhat
*NL*
ostentatiously
through
her
mind
,
it
is
altogether
surprising
what
a
*NL*
calmness
had
come
over
her
.
The
anxiety
and
misgivings
which
had
*NL*
tormented
her
,
whether
asleep
or
in
melancholy
day-dreams
,
ever
since
*NL*
her
project
began
to
take
an
aspect
of
solidity
,
had
now
vanished
quite
*NL*
away
.
She
felt
the
novelty
of
her
position
,
indeed
,
but
no
longer
with
*NL*
disturbance
or
affright
.
Now
and
then
,
there
came
a
thrill
of
almost
*NL*
youthful
enjoyment
.
It
was
the
invigorating
breath
of
a
fresh
outward
*NL*
atmosphere
,
after
the
long
torpor
and
monotonous
seclusion
of
her
life
.
*NL*
So
wholesome
is
effort
!
So
miraculous
the
strength
that
we
do
not
know
*NL*
of
!
The
healthiest
glow
that
Hepzibah
had
known
for
years
had
come
now
*NL*
in
the
dreaded
crisis
,
when
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
had
put
forth
her
*NL*
hand
to
help
herself
.
The
little
circlet
of
the
schoolboy
's
copper
*NL*
coin
--
dim
and
lustreless
though
it
was
,
with
the
small
services
which
*NL*
it
had
been
doing
here
and
there
about
the
world
--
had
proved
a
*NL*
talisman
,
fragrant
with
good
,
and
deserving
to
be
set
in
gold
and
worn
*NL*
next
her
heart
.
It
was
as
potent
,
and
perhaps
endowed
with
the
same
*NL*
kind
of
efficacy
,
as
a
galvanic
ring
!
Hepzibah
,
at
all
events
,
was
*NL*
indebted
to
its
subtile
operation
both
in
body
and
spirit
;
so
much
the
*NL*
more
,
as
it
inspired
her
with
energy
to
get
some
breakfast
,
at
which
,
*NL*
still
the
better
to
keep
up
her
courage
,
she
allowed
herself
an
extra
*NL*
spoonful
in
her
infusion
of
black
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
introductory
day
of
shop-keeping
did
not
run
on
,
however
,
without
*NL*
many
and
serious
interruptions
of
this
mood
of
cheerful
vigor
.
As
a
*NL*
general
rule
,
Providence
seldom
vouchsafes
to
mortals
any
more
than
*NL*
just
that
degree
of
encouragement
which
suffices
to
keep
them
at
a
*NL*
reasonably
full
exertion
of
their
powers
.
In
the
case
of
our
old
*NL*
gentlewoman
,
after
the
excitement
of
new
effort
had
subsided
,
the
*NL*
despondency
of
her
whole
life
threatened
,
ever
and
anon
,
to
return
.
It
*NL*
was
like
the
heavy
mass
of
clouds
which
we
may
often
see
obscuring
the
*NL*
sky
,
and
making
a
gray
twilight
everywhere
,
until
,
towards
nightfall
,
*NL*
it
yields
temporarily
to
a
glimpse
of
sunshine
.
But
,
always
,
the
*NL*
envious
cloud
strives
to
gather
again
across
the
streak
of
celestial
*NL*
azure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Customers
came
in
,
as
the
forenoon
advanced
,
but
rather
slowly
;
in
some
*NL*
cases
,
too
,
it
must
be
owned
,
with
little
satisfaction
either
to
*NL*
themselves
or
Miss
Hepzibah
;
nor
,
on
the
whole
,
with
an
aggregate
of
*NL*
very
rich
emolument
to
the
till
.
A
little
girl
,
sent
by
her
mother
to
*NL*
match
a
skein
of
cotton
thread
,
of
a
peculiar
hue
,
took
one
that
the
*NL*
near-sighted
old
lady
pronounced
extremely
like
,
but
soon
came
running
*NL*
back
,
with
a
blunt
and
cross
message
,
that
it
would
not
do
,
and
,
*NL*
besides
,
was
very
rotten
!
Then
,
there
was
a
pale
,
care-wrinkled
woman
,
*NL*
not
old
but
haggard
,
and
already
with
streaks
of
gray
among
her
hair
,
*NL*
like
silver
ribbons
;
one
of
those
women
,
naturally
delicate
,
whom
you
*NL*
at
once
recognize
as
worn
to
death
by
a
brute
--
probably
a
drunken
*NL*
brute
--
of
a
husband
,
and
at
least
nine
children
.
She
wanted
a
few
*NL*
pounds
of
flour
,
and
offered
the
money
,
which
the
decayed
gentlewoman
*NL*
silently
rejected
,
and
gave
the
poor
soul
better
measure
than
if
she
*NL*
had
taken
it
.
Shortly
afterwards
,
a
man
in
a
blue
cotton
frock
,
much
*NL*
soiled
,
came
in
and
bought
a
pipe
,
filling
the
whole
shop
,
meanwhile
,
*NL*
with
the
hot
odor
of
strong
drink
,
not
only
exhaled
in
the
torrid
*NL*
atmosphere
of
his
breath
,
but
oozing
out
of
his
entire
system
,
like
an
*NL*
inflammable
gas
.
It
was
impressed
on
Hepzibah
's
mind
that
this
was
the
*NL*
husband
of
the
care-wrinkled
woman
.
He
asked
for
a
paper
of
tobacco
;
*NL*
and
as
she
had
neglected
to
provide
herself
with
the
article
,
her
*NL*
brutal
customer
dashed
down
his
newly-bought
pipe
and
left
the
shop
,
*NL*
muttering
some
unintelligible
words
,
which
had
the
tone
and
bitterness
*NL*
of
a
curse
.
Hereupon
Hepzibah
threw
up
her
eyes
,
unintentionally
*NL*
scowling
in
the
face
of
Providence
!
*NL*
*NL*
No
less
than
five
persons
,
during
the
forenoon
,
inquired
for
*NL*
ginger-beer
,
or
root-beer
,
or
any
drink
of
a
similar
brewage
,
and
,
*NL*
obtaining
nothing
of
the
kind
,
went
off
in
an
exceedingly
bad
humor
.
*NL*
Three
of
them
left
the
door
open
,
and
the
other
two
pulled
it
so
*NL*
spitefully
in
going
out
that
the
little
bell
played
the
very
deuce
with
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
nerves
.
A
round
,
bustling
,
fire-ruddy
housewife
of
the
*NL*
neighborhood
burst
breathless
into
the
shop
,
fiercely
demanding
yeast
;
*NL*
and
when
the
poor
gentlewoman
,
with
her
cold
shyness
of
manner
,
gave
*NL*
her
hot
customer
to
understand
that
she
did
not
keep
the
article
,
this
*NL*
very
capable
housewife
took
upon
herself
to
administer
a
regular
rebuke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
cent-shop
,
and
no
yeast
!
''
quoth
she
;
``
That
will
never
do
!
Who
ever
*NL*
heard
of
such
a
thing
?
Your
loaf
will
never
rise
,
no
more
than
mine
*NL*
will
to-day
.
You
had
better
shut
up
shop
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
heaving
a
deep
sigh
,
``
perhaps
I
had
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
times
,
moreover
,
besides
the
above
instance
,
her
lady-like
*NL*
sensibilities
were
seriously
infringed
upon
by
the
familiar
,
if
not
*NL*
rude
,
tone
with
which
people
addressed
her
.
They
evidently
considered
*NL*
themselves
not
merely
her
equals
,
but
her
patrons
and
superiors
.
Now
,
*NL*
Hepzibah
had
unconsciously
flattered
herself
with
the
idea
that
there
*NL*
would
be
a
gleam
or
halo
,
of
some
kind
or
other
,
about
her
person
,
*NL*
which
would
insure
an
obeisance
to
her
sterling
gentility
,
or
,
at
*NL*
least
,
a
tacit
recognition
of
it
.
On
the
other
hand
,
nothing
tortured
*NL*
her
more
intolerably
than
when
this
recognition
was
too
prominently
*NL*
expressed
.
To
one
or
two
rather
officious
offers
of
sympathy
,
her
*NL*
responses
were
little
short
of
acrimonious
;
and
,
we
regret
to
say
,
*NL*
Hepzibah
was
thrown
into
a
positively
unchristian
state
of
mind
by
the
*NL*
suspicion
that
one
of
her
customers
was
drawn
to
the
shop
,
not
by
any
*NL*
real
need
of
the
article
which
she
pretended
to
seek
,
but
by
a
wicked
*NL*
wish
to
stare
at
her
.
The
vulgar
creature
was
determined
to
see
for
*NL*
herself
what
sort
of
a
figure
a
mildewed
piece
of
aristocracy
,
after
*NL*
wasting
all
the
bloom
and
much
of
the
decline
of
her
life
apart
from
*NL*
the
world
,
would
cut
behind
a
counter
.
In
this
particular
case
,
*NL*
however
mechanical
and
innocuous
it
might
be
at
other
times
,
Hepzibah
's
*NL*
contortion
of
brow
served
her
in
good
stead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
was
so
frightened
in
my
life
!
''
said
the
curious
customer
,
in
*NL*
describing
the
incident
to
one
of
her
acquaintances
.
``
She
's
a
real
old
*NL*
vixen
,
take
my
word
of
it
!
She
says
little
,
to
be
sure
;
but
if
you
*NL*
could
only
see
the
mischief
in
her
eye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
whole
,
therefore
,
her
new
experience
led
our
decayed
gentlewoman
*NL*
to
very
disagreeable
conclusions
as
to
the
temper
and
manners
of
what
*NL*
she
termed
the
lower
classes
,
whom
heretofore
she
had
looked
down
upon
*NL*
with
a
gentle
and
pitying
complaisance
,
as
herself
occupying
a
sphere
*NL*
of
unquestionable
superiority
.
But
,
unfortunately
,
she
had
likewise
to
*NL*
struggle
against
a
bitter
emotion
of
a
directly
opposite
kind
:
a
*NL*
sentiment
of
virulence
,
we
mean
,
towards
the
idle
aristocracy
to
which
*NL*
it
had
so
recently
been
her
pride
to
belong
.
When
a
lady
,
in
a
*NL*
delicate
and
costly
summer
garb
,
with
a
floating
veil
and
gracefully
*NL*
swaying
gown
,
and
,
altogether
,
an
ethereal
lightness
that
made
you
look
*NL*
at
her
beautifully
slippered
feet
,
to
see
whether
she
trod
on
the
dust
*NL*
or
floated
in
the
air
,
--
when
such
a
vision
happened
to
pass
through
*NL*
this
retired
street
,
leaving
it
tenderly
and
delusively
fragrant
with
*NL*
her
passage
,
as
if
a
bouquet
of
tea-roses
had
been
borne
along
,
--
then
*NL*
again
,
it
is
to
be
feared
,
old
Hepzibah
's
scowl
could
no
longer
*NL*
vindicate
itself
entirely
on
the
plea
of
near-sightedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
end
,
''
thought
she
,
giving
vent
to
that
feeling
of
hostility
*NL*
which
is
the
only
real
abasement
of
the
poor
in
presence
of
the
*NL*
rich
,
--
``
for
what
good
end
,
in
the
wisdom
of
Providence
,
does
that
woman
*NL*
live
?
Must
the
whole
world
toil
,
that
the
palms
of
her
hands
may
be
*NL*
kept
white
and
delicate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
ashamed
and
penitent
,
she
hid
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
God
forgive
me
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doubtless
,
God
did
forgive
her
.
But
,
taking
the
inward
and
outward
*NL*
history
of
the
first
half-day
into
consideration
,
Hepzibah
began
to
*NL*
fear
that
the
shop
would
prove
her
ruin
in
a
moral
and
religious
point
*NL*
of
view
,
without
contributing
very
essentially
towards
even
her
*NL*
temporal
welfare
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
A
Day
Behind
the
Counter
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
TOWARDS
noon
,
Hepzibah
saw
an
elderly
gentleman
,
large
and
portly
,
and
*NL*
of
remarkably
dignified
demeanor
,
passing
slowly
along
on
the
opposite
*NL*
side
of
the
white
and
dusty
street
.
On
coming
within
the
shadow
of
the
*NL*
Pyncheon
Elm
,
he
stopt
,
and
-LRB-
taking
off
his
hat
,
meanwhile
,
to
wipe
the
*NL*
perspiration
from
his
brow
-RRB-
seemed
to
scrutinize
,
with
especial
*NL*
interest
,
the
dilapidated
and
rusty-visaged
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
*NL*
He
himself
,
in
a
very
different
style
,
was
as
well
worth
looking
at
as
*NL*
the
house
.
No
better
model
need
be
sought
,
nor
could
have
been
found
,
*NL*
of
a
very
high
order
of
respectability
,
which
,
by
some
indescribable
*NL*
magic
,
not
merely
expressed
itself
in
his
looks
and
gestures
,
but
even
*NL*
governed
the
fashion
of
his
garments
,
and
rendered
them
all
proper
and
*NL*
essential
to
the
man
.
Without
appearing
to
differ
,
in
any
tangible
*NL*
way
,
from
other
people
's
clothes
,
there
was
yet
a
wide
and
rich
gravity
*NL*
about
them
that
must
have
been
a
characteristic
of
the
wearer
,
since
it
*NL*
could
not
be
defined
as
pertaining
either
to
the
cut
or
material
.
His
*NL*
gold-headed
cane
,
too
,
--
a
serviceable
staff
,
of
dark
polished
*NL*
wood
,
--
had
similar
traits
,
and
,
had
it
chosen
to
take
a
walk
by
itself
,
*NL*
would
have
been
recognized
anywhere
as
a
tolerably
adequate
*NL*
representative
of
its
master
.
This
character
--
which
showed
itself
so
*NL*
strikingly
in
everything
about
him
,
and
the
effect
of
which
we
seek
to
*NL*
convey
to
the
reader
--
went
no
deeper
than
his
station
,
habits
of
life
,
*NL*
and
external
circumstances
.
One
perceived
him
to
be
a
personage
of
*NL*
marked
influence
and
authority
;
and
,
especially
,
you
could
feel
just
as
*NL*
certain
that
he
was
opulent
as
if
he
had
exhibited
his
bank
account
,
or
*NL*
as
if
you
had
seen
him
touching
the
twigs
of
the
Pyncheon
Elm
,
and
,
*NL*
Midas-like
,
transmuting
them
to
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
youth
,
he
had
probably
been
considered
a
handsome
man
;
at
his
*NL*
present
age
,
his
brow
was
too
heavy
,
his
temples
too
bare
,
his
*NL*
remaining
hair
too
gray
,
his
eye
too
cold
,
his
lips
too
closely
*NL*
compressed
,
to
bear
any
relation
to
mere
personal
beauty
.
He
would
*NL*
have
made
a
good
and
massive
portrait
;
better
now
,
perhaps
,
than
at
any
*NL*
previous
period
of
his
life
,
although
his
look
might
grow
positively
*NL*
harsh
in
the
process
of
being
fixed
upon
the
canvas
.
The
artist
would
*NL*
have
found
it
desirable
to
study
his
face
,
and
prove
its
capacity
for
*NL*
varied
expression
;
to
darken
it
with
a
frown
,
--
to
kindle
it
up
with
a
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
elderly
gentleman
stood
looking
at
the
Pyncheon
House
,
both
*NL*
the
frown
and
the
smile
passed
successively
over
his
countenance
.
His
*NL*
eye
rested
on
the
shop-window
,
and
putting
up
a
pair
of
gold-bowed
*NL*
spectacles
,
which
he
held
in
his
hand
,
he
minutely
surveyed
Hepzibah
's
*NL*
little
arrangement
of
toys
and
commodities
.
At
first
it
seemed
not
to
*NL*
please
him
,
--
nay
,
to
cause
him
exceeding
displeasure
,
--
and
yet
,
the
*NL*
very
next
moment
,
he
smiled
.
While
the
latter
expression
was
yet
on
*NL*
his
lips
,
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
Hepzibah
,
who
had
involuntarily
bent
*NL*
forward
to
the
window
;
and
then
the
smile
changed
from
acrid
and
*NL*
disagreeable
to
the
sunniest
complacency
and
benevolence
.
He
bowed
,
*NL*
with
a
happy
mixture
of
dignity
and
courteous
kindliness
,
and
pursued
*NL*
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
is
!
''
said
Hepzibah
to
herself
,
gulping
down
a
very
bitter
*NL*
emotion
,
and
,
since
she
could
not
rid
herself
of
it
,
trying
to
drive
it
*NL*
back
into
her
heart
.
``
What
does
he
think
of
it
,
I
wonder
?
Does
it
*NL*
please
him
?
Ah
!
he
is
looking
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
had
paused
in
the
street
,
and
turned
himself
half
about
,
*NL*
still
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
shop-window
.
In
fact
,
he
wheeled
*NL*
wholly
round
,
and
commenced
a
step
or
two
,
as
if
designing
to
enter
the
*NL*
shop
;
but
,
as
it
chanced
,
his
purpose
was
anticipated
by
Hepzibah
's
*NL*
first
customer
,
the
little
cannibal
of
Jim
Crow
,
who
,
staring
up
at
the
*NL*
window
,
was
irresistibly
attracted
by
an
elephant
of
gingerbread
.
What
*NL*
a
grand
appetite
had
this
small
urchin
!
--
Two
Jim
Crows
immediately
*NL*
after
breakfast
!
--
and
now
an
elephant
,
as
a
preliminary
whet
before
*NL*
dinner
.
By
the
time
this
latter
purchase
was
completed
,
the
elderly
*NL*
gentleman
had
resumed
his
way
,
and
turned
the
street
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
as
you
like
,
Cousin
Jaffrey
,
''
muttered
the
maiden
lady
,
as
*NL*
she
drew
back
,
after
cautiously
thrusting
out
her
head
,
and
looking
up
*NL*
and
down
the
street
,
--
``
Take
it
as
you
like
!
You
have
seen
my
little
*NL*
shop-window
.
Well
!
--
what
have
you
to
say
?
--
is
not
the
Pyncheon
House
*NL*
my
own
,
while
I
'm
alive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
incident
,
Hepzibah
retreated
to
the
back
parlor
,
where
she
*NL*
at
first
caught
up
a
half-finished
stocking
,
and
began
knitting
at
it
*NL*
with
nervous
and
irregular
jerks
;
but
quickly
finding
herself
at
odds
*NL*
with
the
stitches
,
she
threw
it
aside
,
and
walked
hurriedly
about
the
*NL*
room
.
At
length
she
paused
before
the
portrait
of
the
stern
old
*NL*
Puritan
,
her
ancestor
,
and
the
founder
of
the
house
.
In
one
sense
,
this
*NL*
picture
had
almost
faded
into
the
canvas
,
and
hidden
itself
behind
the
*NL*
duskiness
of
age
;
in
another
,
she
could
not
but
fancy
that
it
had
been
*NL*
growing
more
prominent
and
strikingly
expressive
,
ever
since
her
*NL*
earliest
familiarity
with
it
as
a
child
.
For
,
while
the
physical
*NL*
outline
and
substance
were
darkening
away
from
the
beholder
's
eye
,
the
*NL*
bold
,
hard
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
indirect
character
of
the
man
seemed
*NL*
to
be
brought
out
in
a
kind
of
spiritual
relief
.
Such
an
effect
may
*NL*
occasionally
be
observed
in
pictures
of
antique
date
.
They
acquire
a
*NL*
look
which
an
artist
-LRB-
if
he
have
anything
like
the
complacency
of
*NL*
artists
nowadays
-RRB-
would
never
dream
of
presenting
to
a
patron
as
his
*NL*
own
characteristic
expression
,
but
which
,
nevertheless
,
we
at
once
*NL*
recognize
as
reflecting
the
unlovely
truth
of
a
human
soul
.
In
such
*NL*
cases
,
the
painter
's
deep
conception
of
his
subject
's
inward
traits
has
*NL*
wrought
itself
into
the
essence
of
the
picture
,
and
is
seen
after
the
*NL*
superficial
coloring
has
been
rubbed
off
by
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
gazing
at
the
portrait
,
Hepzibah
trembled
under
its
eye
.
Her
*NL*
hereditary
reverence
made
her
afraid
to
judge
the
character
of
the
*NL*
original
so
harshly
as
a
perception
of
the
truth
compelled
her
to
do
.
*NL*
But
still
she
gazed
,
because
the
face
of
the
picture
enabled
her
--
at
*NL*
least
,
she
fancied
so
--
to
read
more
accurately
,
and
to
a
greater
depth
,
*NL*
the
face
which
she
had
just
seen
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
very
man
!
''
murmured
she
to
herself
.
``
Let
Jaffrey
Pyncheon
*NL*
smile
as
he
will
,
there
is
that
look
beneath
!
Put
on
him
a
skull-cap
,
*NL*
and
a
band
,
and
a
black
cloak
,
and
a
Bible
in
one
hand
and
a
sword
in
*NL*
the
other
,
--
then
let
Jaffrey
smile
as
he
might
,
--
nobody
would
doubt
*NL*
that
it
was
the
old
Pyncheon
come
again
.
He
has
proved
himself
the
*NL*
very
man
to
build
up
a
new
house
!
Perhaps
,
too
,
to
draw
down
a
new
*NL*
curse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
did
Hepzibah
bewilder
herself
with
these
fantasies
of
the
old
*NL*
time
.
She
had
dwelt
too
much
alone
,
--
too
long
in
the
Pyncheon
*NL*
House
,
--
until
her
very
brain
was
impregnated
with
the
dry-rot
of
its
*NL*
timbers
.
She
needed
a
walk
along
the
noonday
street
to
keep
her
sane
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
spell
of
contrast
,
another
portrait
rose
up
before
her
,
painted
*NL*
with
more
daring
flattery
than
any
artist
would
have
ventured
upon
,
but
*NL*
yet
so
delicately
touched
that
the
likeness
remained
perfect
.
*NL*
Malbone
's
miniature
,
though
from
the
same
original
,
was
far
inferior
to
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
air-drawn
picture
,
at
which
affection
and
sorrowful
*NL*
remembrance
wrought
together
.
Soft
,
mildly
,
and
cheerfully
*NL*
contemplative
,
with
full
,
red
lips
,
just
on
the
verge
of
a
smile
,
which
*NL*
the
eyes
seemed
to
herald
by
a
gentle
kindling-up
of
their
orbs
!
*NL*
Feminine
traits
,
moulded
inseparably
with
those
of
the
other
sex
!
The
*NL*
miniature
,
likewise
,
had
this
last
peculiarity
;
so
that
you
inevitably
*NL*
thought
of
the
original
as
resembling
his
mother
,
and
she
a
lovely
and
*NL*
lovable
woman
,
with
perhaps
some
beautiful
infirmity
of
character
,
that
*NL*
made
it
all
the
pleasanter
to
know
and
easier
to
love
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
thought
Hepzibah
,
with
grief
of
which
it
was
only
the
more
*NL*
tolerable
portion
that
welled
up
from
her
heart
to
her
eyelids
,
``
they
*NL*
persecuted
his
mother
in
him
!
He
never
was
a
Pyncheon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
the
shop-bell
rang
;
it
was
like
a
sound
from
a
remote
*NL*
distance
,
--
so
far
had
Hepzibah
descended
into
the
sepulchral
depths
of
*NL*
her
reminiscences
.
On
entering
the
shop
,
she
found
an
old
man
there
,
a
*NL*
humble
resident
of
Pyncheon
Street
,
and
whom
,
for
a
great
many
years
*NL*
past
,
she
had
suffered
to
be
a
kind
of
familiar
of
the
house
.
He
was
*NL*
an
immemorial
personage
,
who
seemed
always
to
have
had
a
white
head
and
*NL*
wrinkles
,
and
never
to
have
possessed
but
a
single
tooth
,
and
that
a
*NL*
half-decayed
one
,
in
the
front
of
the
upper
jaw
.
Well
advanced
as
*NL*
Hepzibah
was
,
she
could
not
remember
when
Uncle
Venner
,
as
the
*NL*
neighborhood
called
him
,
had
not
gone
up
and
down
the
street
,
stooping
*NL*
a
little
and
drawing
his
feet
heavily
over
the
gravel
or
pavement
.
But
*NL*
still
there
was
something
tough
and
vigorous
about
him
,
that
not
only
*NL*
kept
him
in
daily
breath
,
but
enabled
him
to
fill
a
place
which
would
*NL*
else
have
been
vacant
in
the
apparently
crowded
world
.
To
go
of
*NL*
errands
with
his
slow
and
shuffling
gait
,
which
made
you
doubt
how
he
*NL*
ever
was
to
arrive
anywhere
;
to
saw
a
small
household
's
foot
or
two
of
*NL*
firewood
,
or
knock
to
pieces
an
old
barrel
,
or
split
up
a
pine
board
*NL*
for
kindling-stuff
;
in
summer
,
to
dig
the
few
yards
of
garden
ground
*NL*
appertaining
to
a
low-rented
tenement
,
and
share
the
produce
of
his
*NL*
labor
at
the
halves
;
in
winter
,
to
shovel
away
the
snow
from
the
*NL*
sidewalk
,
or
open
paths
to
the
woodshed
,
or
along
the
clothes-line
;
*NL*
such
were
some
of
the
essential
offices
which
Uncle
Venner
performed
*NL*
among
at
least
a
score
of
families
.
Within
that
circle
,
he
claimed
the
*NL*
same
sort
of
privilege
,
and
probably
felt
as
much
warmth
of
interest
,
*NL*
as
a
clergyman
does
in
the
range
of
his
parishioners
.
Not
that
he
laid
*NL*
claim
to
the
tithe
pig
;
but
,
as
an
analogous
mode
of
reverence
,
he
went
*NL*
his
rounds
,
every
morning
,
to
gather
up
the
crumbs
of
the
table
and
*NL*
overflowings
of
the
dinner-pot
,
as
food
for
a
pig
of
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
younger
days
--
for
,
after
all
,
there
was
a
dim
tradition
that
he
*NL*
had
been
,
not
young
,
but
younger
--
Uncle
Venner
was
commonly
regarded
as
*NL*
rather
deficient
,
than
otherwise
,
in
his
wits
.
In
truth
he
had
*NL*
virtually
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge
,
by
scarcely
aiming
at
such
*NL*
success
as
other
men
seek
,
and
by
taking
only
that
humble
and
modest
*NL*
part
in
the
intercourse
of
life
which
belongs
to
the
alleged
*NL*
deficiency
.
But
now
,
in
his
extreme
old
age
,
--
whether
it
were
that
his
*NL*
long
and
hard
experience
had
actually
brightened
him
,
or
that
his
*NL*
decaying
judgment
rendered
him
less
capable
of
fairly
measuring
*NL*
himself
,
--
the
venerable
man
made
pretensions
to
no
little
wisdom
,
and
*NL*
really
enjoyed
the
credit
of
it
.
There
was
likewise
,
at
times
,
a
vein
*NL*
of
something
like
poetry
in
him
;
it
was
the
moss
or
wall-flower
of
his
*NL*
mind
in
its
small
dilapidation
,
and
gave
a
charm
to
what
might
have
*NL*
been
vulgar
and
commonplace
in
his
earlier
and
middle
life
.
Hepzibah
*NL*
had
a
regard
for
him
,
because
his
name
was
ancient
in
the
town
and
had
*NL*
formerly
been
respectable
.
It
was
a
still
better
reason
for
awarding
*NL*
him
a
species
of
familiar
reverence
that
Uncle
Venner
was
himself
the
*NL*
most
ancient
existence
,
whether
of
man
or
thing
,
in
Pyncheon
Street
,
*NL*
except
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
and
perhaps
the
elm
that
*NL*
overshadowed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
patriarch
now
presented
himself
before
Hepzibah
,
clad
in
an
old
*NL*
blue
coat
,
which
had
a
fashionable
air
,
and
must
have
accrued
to
him
*NL*
from
the
cast-off
wardrobe
of
some
dashing
clerk
.
As
for
his
trousers
,
*NL*
they
were
of
tow-cloth
,
very
short
in
the
legs
,
and
bagging
down
*NL*
strangely
in
the
rear
,
but
yet
having
a
suitableness
to
his
figure
*NL*
which
his
other
garment
entirely
lacked
.
His
hat
had
relation
to
no
*NL*
other
part
of
his
dress
,
and
but
very
little
to
the
head
that
wore
it
.
*NL*
Thus
Uncle
Venner
was
a
miscellaneous
old
gentleman
,
partly
himself
,
*NL*
but
,
in
good
measure
,
somebody
else
;
patched
together
,
too
,
of
*NL*
different
epochs
;
an
epitome
of
times
and
fashions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
you
have
really
begun
trade
,
''
said
he
,
--
``
really
begun
trade
!
*NL*
Well
,
I
'm
glad
to
see
it
.
Young
people
should
never
live
idle
in
the
*NL*
world
,
nor
old
ones
neither
,
unless
when
the
rheumatize
gets
hold
of
*NL*
them
.
It
has
given
me
warning
already
;
and
in
two
or
three
years
*NL*
longer
,
I
shall
think
of
putting
aside
business
and
retiring
to
my
*NL*
farm
.
That
's
yonder
,
--
the
great
brick
house
,
you
know
,
--
the
workhouse
,
*NL*
most
folks
call
it
;
but
I
mean
to
do
my
work
first
,
and
go
there
to
be
*NL*
idle
and
enjoy
myself
.
And
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
beginning
to
do
your
*NL*
work
,
Miss
Hepzibah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Uncle
Venner
''
said
Hepzibah
,
smiling
;
for
she
always
felt
*NL*
kindly
towards
the
simple
and
talkative
old
man
.
Had
he
been
an
old
*NL*
woman
,
she
might
probably
have
repelled
the
freedom
,
which
she
now
took
*NL*
in
good
part
.
``
It
is
time
for
me
to
begin
work
,
indeed
!
Or
,
to
speak
*NL*
the
truth
,
I
have
just
begun
when
I
ought
to
be
giving
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
never
say
that
,
Miss
Hepzibah
!
''
answered
the
old
man
.
``
You
are
a
*NL*
young
woman
yet
.
Why
,
I
hardly
thought
myself
younger
than
I
am
now
,
*NL*
it
seems
so
little
while
ago
since
I
used
to
see
you
playing
about
the
*NL*
door
of
the
old
house
,
quite
a
small
child
!
Oftener
,
though
,
you
used
*NL*
to
be
sitting
at
the
threshold
,
and
looking
gravely
into
the
street
;
*NL*
for
you
had
always
a
grave
kind
of
way
with
you
,
--
a
grown-up
air
,
when
*NL*
you
were
only
the
height
of
my
knee
.
It
seems
as
if
I
saw
you
now
;
and
*NL*
your
grandfather
with
his
red
cloak
,
and
his
white
wig
,
and
his
cocked
*NL*
hat
,
and
his
cane
,
coming
out
of
the
house
,
and
stepping
so
grandly
up
*NL*
the
street
!
Those
old
gentlemen
that
grew
up
before
the
Revolution
used
*NL*
to
put
on
grand
airs
.
In
my
young
days
,
the
great
man
of
the
town
was
*NL*
commonly
called
King
;
and
his
wife
,
not
Queen
to
be
sure
,
but
Lady
.
*NL*
Nowadays
,
a
man
would
not
dare
to
be
called
King
;
and
if
he
feels
*NL*
himself
a
little
above
common
folks
,
he
only
stoops
so
much
the
lower
*NL*
to
them
.
I
met
your
cousin
,
the
Judge
,
ten
minutes
ago
;
and
,
in
my
old
*NL*
tow-cloth
trousers
,
as
you
see
,
the
Judge
raised
his
hat
to
me
,
I
do
*NL*
believe
!
At
any
rate
,
the
Judge
bowed
and
smiled
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
with
something
bitter
stealing
unawares
into
her
*NL*
tone
;
``
my
cousin
Jaffrey
is
thought
to
have
a
very
pleasant
smile
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
he
has
''
replied
Uncle
Venner
.
``
And
that
's
rather
remarkable
in
*NL*
a
Pyncheon
;
for
,
begging
your
pardon
,
Miss
Hepzibah
,
they
never
had
the
*NL*
name
of
being
an
easy
and
agreeable
set
of
folks
.
There
was
no
getting
*NL*
close
to
them
.
But
Now
,
Miss
Hepzibah
,
if
an
old
man
may
be
bold
to
*NL*
ask
,
why
do
n't
Judge
Pyncheon
,
with
his
great
means
,
step
forward
,
and
*NL*
tell
his
cousin
to
shut
up
her
little
shop
at
once
?
It
's
for
your
*NL*
credit
to
be
doing
something
,
but
it
's
not
for
the
Judge
's
credit
to
*NL*
let
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
wo
n't
talk
of
this
,
if
you
please
,
Uncle
Venner
,
''
said
Hepzibah
*NL*
coldly
.
``
I
ought
to
say
,
however
,
that
,
if
I
choose
to
earn
bread
for
*NL*
myself
,
it
is
not
Judge
Pyncheon
's
fault
.
Neither
will
he
deserve
the
*NL*
blame
,
''
added
she
more
kindly
,
remembering
Uncle
Venner
's
privileges
of
*NL*
age
and
humble
familiarity
,
``
if
I
should
,
by
and
by
,
find
it
convenient
*NL*
to
retire
with
you
to
your
farm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
's
no
bad
place
,
either
,
that
farm
of
mine
!
''
cried
the
old
man
*NL*
cheerily
,
as
if
there
were
something
positively
delightful
in
the
*NL*
prospect
.
``
No
bad
place
is
the
great
brick
farm-house
,
especially
for
*NL*
them
that
will
find
a
good
many
old
cronies
there
,
as
will
be
my
case
.
*NL*
I
quite
long
to
be
among
them
,
sometimes
,
of
the
winter
evenings
;
for
*NL*
it
is
but
dull
business
for
a
lonesome
elderly
man
,
like
me
,
to
be
*NL*
nodding
,
by
the
hour
together
,
with
no
company
but
his
air-tight
stove
.
*NL*
Summer
or
winter
,
there
's
a
great
deal
to
be
said
in
favor
of
my
farm
!
*NL*
And
,
take
it
in
the
autumn
,
what
can
be
pleasanter
than
to
spend
a
*NL*
whole
day
on
the
sunny
side
of
a
barn
or
a
wood-pile
,
chatting
with
*NL*
somebody
as
old
as
one
's
self
;
or
,
perhaps
,
idling
away
the
time
with
a
*NL*
natural-born
simpleton
,
who
knows
how
to
be
idle
,
because
even
our
busy
*NL*
Yankees
never
have
found
out
how
to
put
him
to
any
use
?
Upon
my
word
,
*NL*
Miss
Hepzibah
,
I
doubt
whether
I
've
ever
been
so
comfortable
as
I
mean
*NL*
to
be
at
my
farm
,
which
most
folks
call
the
workhouse
.
But
*NL*
you
,
--
you
're
a
young
woman
yet
,
--
you
never
need
go
there
!
Something
*NL*
still
better
will
turn
up
for
you
.
I
'm
sure
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
fancied
that
there
was
something
peculiar
in
her
venerable
*NL*
friend
's
look
and
tone
;
insomuch
,
that
she
gazed
into
his
face
with
*NL*
considerable
earnestness
,
endeavoring
to
discover
what
secret
meaning
,
*NL*
if
any
,
might
be
lurking
there
.
Individuals
whose
affairs
have
reached
*NL*
an
utterly
desperate
crisis
almost
invariably
keep
themselves
alive
*NL*
with
hopes
,
so
much
the
more
airily
magnificent
as
they
have
the
less
*NL*
of
solid
matter
within
their
grasp
whereof
to
mould
any
judicious
and
*NL*
moderate
expectation
of
good
.
Thus
,
all
the
while
Hepzibah
was
*NL*
perfecting
the
scheme
of
her
little
shop
,
she
had
cherished
an
*NL*
unacknowledged
idea
that
some
harlequin
trick
of
fortune
would
*NL*
intervene
in
her
favor
.
For
example
,
an
uncle
--
who
had
sailed
for
*NL*
India
fifty
years
before
,
and
never
been
heard
of
since
--
might
yet
*NL*
return
,
and
adopt
her
to
be
the
comfort
of
his
very
extreme
and
*NL*
decrepit
age
,
and
adorn
her
with
pearls
,
diamonds
,
and
Oriental
shawls
*NL*
and
turbans
,
and
make
her
the
ultimate
heiress
of
his
unreckonable
*NL*
riches
.
Or
the
member
of
Parliament
,
now
at
the
head
of
the
English
*NL*
branch
of
the
family
,
--
with
which
the
elder
stock
,
on
this
side
of
the
*NL*
Atlantic
,
had
held
little
or
no
intercourse
for
the
last
two
*NL*
centuries
,
--
this
eminent
gentleman
might
invite
Hepzibah
to
quit
the
*NL*
ruinous
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
and
come
over
to
dwell
with
her
*NL*
kindred
at
Pyncheon
Hall
.
But
,
for
reasons
the
most
imperative
,
she
*NL*
could
not
yield
to
his
request
.
It
was
more
probable
,
therefore
,
that
*NL*
the
descendants
of
a
Pyncheon
who
had
emigrated
to
Virginia
,
in
some
*NL*
past
generation
,
and
became
a
great
planter
there
,
--
hearing
of
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
destitution
,
and
impelled
by
the
splendid
generosity
of
*NL*
character
with
which
their
Virginian
mixture
must
have
enriched
the
New
*NL*
England
blood
,
--
would
send
her
a
remittance
of
a
thousand
dollars
,
with
*NL*
a
hint
of
repeating
the
favor
annually
.
Or
,
--
and
,
surely
,
anything
so
*NL*
undeniably
just
could
not
be
beyond
the
limits
of
reasonable
*NL*
anticipation
,
--
the
great
claim
to
the
heritage
of
Waldo
County
might
*NL*
finally
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
Pyncheons
;
so
that
,
instead
of
*NL*
keeping
a
cent-shop
,
Hepzibah
would
build
a
palace
,
and
look
down
from
*NL*
its
highest
tower
on
hill
,
dale
,
forest
,
field
,
and
town
,
as
her
own
*NL*
share
of
the
ancestral
territory
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
some
of
the
fantasies
which
she
had
long
dreamed
about
;
and
,
*NL*
aided
by
these
,
Uncle
Venner
's
casual
attempt
at
encouragement
kindled
*NL*
a
strange
festal
glory
in
the
poor
,
bare
,
melancholy
chambers
of
her
*NL*
brain
,
as
if
that
inner
world
were
suddenly
lighted
up
with
gas
.
But
*NL*
either
he
knew
nothing
of
her
castles
in
the
air
,
--
as
how
should
*NL*
he
?
--
or
else
her
earnest
scowl
disturbed
his
recollection
,
as
it
might
*NL*
a
more
courageous
man
's
.
Instead
of
pursuing
any
weightier
topic
,
*NL*
Uncle
Venner
was
pleased
to
favor
Hepzibah
with
some
sage
counsel
in
*NL*
her
shop-keeping
capacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
no
credit
!
''
--
these
were
some
of
his
golden
maxims
,
--
``
Never
take
*NL*
paper-money
.
Look
well
to
your
change
!
Ring
the
silver
on
the
*NL*
four-pound
weight
!
Shove
back
all
English
half-pence
and
base
copper
*NL*
tokens
,
such
as
are
very
plenty
about
town
!
At
your
leisure
hours
,
knit
*NL*
children
's
woollen
socks
and
mittens
!
Brew
your
own
yeast
,
and
make
*NL*
your
own
ginger-beer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
Hepzibah
was
doing
her
utmost
to
digest
the
hard
little
*NL*
pellets
of
his
already
uttered
wisdom
,
he
gave
vent
to
his
final
,
and
*NL*
what
he
declared
to
be
his
all-important
advice
,
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
on
a
bright
face
for
your
customers
,
and
smile
pleasantly
as
you
*NL*
hand
them
what
they
ask
for
!
A
stale
article
,
if
you
dip
it
in
a
good
,
*NL*
warm
,
sunny
smile
,
will
go
off
better
than
a
fresh
one
that
you
've
*NL*
scowled
upon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
last
apothegm
poor
Hepzibah
responded
with
a
sigh
so
deep
and
*NL*
heavy
that
it
almost
rustled
Uncle
Venner
quite
away
,
like
a
withered
*NL*
leaf
,
--
as
he
was
,
--
before
an
autumnal
gale
.
Recovering
himself
,
*NL*
however
,
he
bent
forward
,
and
,
with
a
good
deal
of
feeling
in
his
*NL*
ancient
visage
,
beckoned
her
nearer
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
you
expect
him
home
?
''
whispered
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
mean
?
''
asked
Hepzibah
,
turning
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
--
You
do
n't
love
to
talk
about
it
,
''
said
Uncle
Venner
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
well
!
we
'll
say
no
more
,
though
there
's
word
of
it
all
over
town
.
I
*NL*
remember
him
,
Miss
Hepzibah
,
before
he
could
run
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
remainder
of
the
day
,
poor
Hepzibah
acquitted
herself
even
*NL*
less
creditably
,
as
a
shop-keeper
,
than
in
her
earlier
efforts
.
She
*NL*
appeared
to
be
walking
in
a
dream
;
or
,
more
truly
,
the
vivid
life
and
*NL*
reality
assumed
by
her
emotions
made
all
outward
occurrences
*NL*
unsubstantial
,
like
the
teasing
phantasms
of
a
half-conscious
slumber
.
*NL*
She
still
responded
,
mechanically
,
to
the
frequent
summons
of
the
*NL*
shop-bell
,
and
,
at
the
demand
of
her
customers
,
went
prying
with
vague
*NL*
eyes
about
the
shop
,
proffering
them
one
article
after
another
,
and
*NL*
thrusting
aside
--
perversely
,
as
most
of
them
supposed
--
the
identical
*NL*
thing
they
asked
for
.
There
is
sad
confusion
,
indeed
,
when
the
spirit
*NL*
thus
flits
away
into
the
past
,
or
into
the
more
awful
future
,
or
,
in
*NL*
any
manner
,
steps
across
the
spaceless
boundary
betwixt
its
own
region
*NL*
and
the
actual
world
;
where
the
body
remains
to
guide
itself
as
best
it
*NL*
may
,
with
little
more
than
the
mechanism
of
animal
life
.
It
is
like
*NL*
death
,
without
death
's
quiet
privilege
,
--
its
freedom
from
mortal
care
.
*NL*
Worst
of
all
,
when
the
actual
duties
are
comprised
in
such
petty
*NL*
details
as
now
vexed
the
brooding
soul
of
the
old
gentlewoman
.
As
the
*NL*
animosity
of
fate
would
have
it
,
there
was
a
great
influx
of
custom
in
*NL*
the
course
of
the
afternoon
.
Hepzibah
blundered
to
and
fro
about
her
*NL*
small
place
of
business
,
committing
the
most
unheard-of
errors
:
now
*NL*
stringing
up
twelve
,
and
now
seven
,
tallow-candles
,
instead
of
ten
to
*NL*
the
pound
;
selling
ginger
for
Scotch
snuff
,
pins
for
needles
,
and
*NL*
needles
for
pins
;
misreckoning
her
change
,
sometimes
to
the
public
*NL*
detriment
,
and
much
oftener
to
her
own
;
and
thus
she
went
on
,
doing
her
*NL*
utmost
to
bring
chaos
back
again
,
until
,
at
the
close
of
the
day
's
*NL*
labor
,
to
her
inexplicable
astonishment
,
she
found
the
money-drawer
*NL*
almost
destitute
of
coin
.
After
all
her
painful
traffic
,
the
whole
*NL*
proceeds
were
perhaps
half
a
dozen
coppers
,
and
a
questionable
*NL*
ninepence
which
ultimately
proved
to
be
copper
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
price
,
or
at
whatever
price
,
she
rejoiced
that
the
day
had
*NL*
reached
its
end
.
Never
before
had
she
had
such
a
sense
of
the
*NL*
intolerable
length
of
time
that
creeps
between
dawn
and
sunset
,
and
of
*NL*
the
miserable
irksomeness
of
having
aught
to
do
,
and
of
the
better
*NL*
wisdom
that
it
would
be
to
lie
down
at
once
,
in
sullen
resignation
,
and
*NL*
let
life
,
and
its
toils
and
vexations
,
trample
over
one
's
prostrate
*NL*
body
as
they
may
!
Hepzibah
's
final
operation
was
with
the
little
*NL*
devourer
of
Jim
Crow
and
the
elephant
,
who
now
proposed
to
eat
a
camel
.
*NL*
In
her
bewilderment
,
she
offered
him
first
a
wooden
dragoon
,
and
next
a
*NL*
handful
of
marbles
;
neither
of
which
being
adapted
to
his
else
*NL*
omnivorous
appetite
,
she
hastily
held
out
her
whole
remaining
stock
of
*NL*
natural
history
in
gingerbread
,
and
huddled
the
small
customer
out
of
*NL*
the
shop
.
She
then
muffled
the
bell
in
an
unfinished
stocking
,
and
put
*NL*
up
the
oaken
bar
across
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
latter
process
,
an
omnibus
came
to
a
stand-still
under
the
*NL*
branches
of
the
elm-tree
.
Hepzibah
's
heart
was
in
her
mouth
.
Remote
*NL*
and
dusky
,
and
with
no
sunshine
on
all
the
intervening
space
,
was
that
*NL*
region
of
the
Past
whence
her
only
guest
might
be
expected
to
arrive
!
*NL*
Was
she
to
meet
him
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
Somebody
,
at
all
events
,
was
passing
from
the
farthest
interior
of
the
*NL*
omnibus
towards
its
entrance
.
A
gentleman
alighted
;
but
it
was
only
*NL*
to
offer
his
hand
to
a
young
girl
whose
slender
figure
,
nowise
needing
*NL*
such
assistance
,
now
lightly
descended
the
steps
,
and
made
an
airy
*NL*
little
jump
from
the
final
one
to
the
sidewalk
.
She
rewarded
her
*NL*
cavalier
with
a
smile
,
the
cheery
glow
of
which
was
seen
reflected
on
*NL*
his
own
face
as
he
reentered
the
vehicle
.
The
girl
then
turned
towards
*NL*
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
to
the
door
of
which
,
meanwhile
,
--
not
*NL*
the
shop-door
,
but
the
antique
portal
,
--
the
omnibus-man
had
carried
a
*NL*
light
trunk
and
a
bandbox
.
First
giving
a
sharp
rap
of
the
old
iron
*NL*
knocker
,
he
left
his
passenger
and
her
luggage
at
the
door-step
,
and
*NL*
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
can
it
be
?
''
thought
Hepzibah
,
who
had
been
screwing
her
visual
*NL*
organs
into
the
acutest
focus
of
which
they
were
capable
.
``
The
girl
*NL*
must
have
mistaken
the
house
.
''
She
stole
softly
into
the
hall
,
and
,
*NL*
herself
invisible
,
gazed
through
the
dusty
side-lights
of
the
portal
at
*NL*
the
young
,
blooming
,
and
very
cheerful
face
which
presented
itself
for
*NL*
admittance
into
the
gloomy
old
mansion
.
It
was
a
face
to
which
almost
*NL*
any
door
would
have
opened
of
its
own
accord
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
,
so
fresh
,
so
unconventional
,
and
yet
so
orderly
and
*NL*
obedient
to
common
rules
,
as
you
at
once
recognized
her
to
be
,
was
*NL*
widely
in
contrast
,
at
that
moment
,
with
everything
about
her
.
The
*NL*
sordid
and
ugly
luxuriance
of
gigantic
weeds
that
grew
in
the
angle
of
*NL*
the
house
,
and
the
heavy
projection
that
overshadowed
her
,
and
the
*NL*
time-worn
framework
of
the
door
,
--
none
of
these
things
belonged
to
her
*NL*
sphere
.
But
,
even
as
a
ray
of
sunshine
,
fall
into
what
dismal
place
it
*NL*
may
,
instantaneously
creates
for
itself
a
propriety
in
being
there
,
so
*NL*
did
it
seem
altogether
fit
that
the
girl
should
be
standing
at
the
*NL*
threshold
.
It
was
no
less
evidently
proper
that
the
door
should
swing
*NL*
open
to
admit
her
.
The
maiden
lady
herself
,
sternly
inhospitable
in
*NL*
her
first
purposes
,
soon
began
to
feel
that
the
door
ought
to
be
shoved
*NL*
back
,
and
the
rusty
key
be
turned
in
the
reluctant
lock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
Phoebe
?
''
questioned
she
within
herself
.
``
It
must
be
little
*NL*
Phoebe
;
for
it
can
be
nobody
else
,
--
and
there
is
a
look
of
her
father
*NL*
about
her
,
too
!
But
what
does
she
want
here
?
And
how
like
a
country
*NL*
cousin
,
to
come
down
upon
a
poor
body
in
this
way
,
without
so
much
as
a
*NL*
day
's
notice
,
or
asking
whether
she
would
be
welcome
!
Well
;
she
must
*NL*
have
a
night
's
lodging
,
I
suppose
;
and
to-morrow
the
child
shall
go
*NL*
back
to
her
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebe
,
it
must
be
understood
,
was
that
one
little
offshoot
of
the
*NL*
Pyncheon
race
to
whom
we
have
already
referred
,
as
a
native
of
a
rural
*NL*
part
of
New
England
,
where
the
old
fashions
and
feelings
of
*NL*
relationship
are
still
partially
kept
up
.
In
her
own
circle
,
it
was
*NL*
regarded
as
by
no
means
improper
for
kinsfolk
to
visit
one
another
*NL*
without
invitation
,
or
preliminary
and
ceremonious
warning
.
Yet
,
in
*NL*
consideration
of
Miss
Hepzibah
's
recluse
way
of
life
,
a
letter
had
*NL*
actually
been
written
and
despatched
,
conveying
information
of
Phoebe
's
*NL*
projected
visit
.
This
epistle
,
for
three
or
four
days
past
,
had
been
*NL*
in
the
pocket
of
the
penny-postman
,
who
,
happening
to
have
no
other
*NL*
business
in
Pyncheon
Street
,
had
not
yet
made
it
convenient
to
call
at
*NL*
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
she
can
stay
only
one
night
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
unbolting
the
door
.
*NL*
``
If
Clifford
were
to
find
her
here
,
it
might
disturb
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
May
and
November
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
PHOEBE
PYNCHEON
slept
,
on
the
night
of
her
arrival
,
in
a
chamber
that
*NL*
looked
down
on
the
garden
of
the
old
house
.
It
fronted
towards
the
*NL*
east
,
so
that
at
a
very
seasonable
hour
a
glow
of
crimson
light
came
*NL*
flooding
through
the
window
,
and
bathed
the
dingy
ceiling
and
*NL*
paper-hangings
in
its
own
hue
.
There
were
curtains
to
Phoebe
's
bed
;
a
*NL*
dark
,
antique
canopy
,
and
ponderous
festoons
of
a
stuff
which
had
been
*NL*
rich
,
and
even
magnificent
,
in
its
time
;
but
which
now
brooded
over
the
*NL*
girl
like
a
cloud
,
making
a
night
in
that
one
corner
,
while
elsewhere
*NL*
it
was
beginning
to
be
day
.
The
morning
light
,
however
,
soon
stole
*NL*
into
the
aperture
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
betwixt
those
faded
curtains
.
*NL*
Finding
the
new
guest
there
,
--
with
a
bloom
on
her
cheeks
like
the
*NL*
morning
's
own
,
and
a
gentle
stir
of
departing
slumber
in
her
limbs
,
as
*NL*
when
an
early
breeze
moves
the
foliage
,
--
the
dawn
kissed
her
brow
.
It
*NL*
was
the
caress
which
a
dewy
maiden
--
such
as
the
Dawn
is
,
*NL*
immortally
--
gives
to
her
sleeping
sister
,
partly
from
the
impulse
of
*NL*
irresistible
fondness
,
and
partly
as
a
pretty
hint
that
it
is
time
now
*NL*
to
unclose
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
touch
of
those
lips
of
light
,
Phoebe
quietly
awoke
,
and
,
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
did
not
recognize
where
she
was
,
nor
how
those
heavy
curtains
*NL*
chanced
to
be
festooned
around
her
.
Nothing
,
indeed
,
was
absolutely
*NL*
plain
to
her
,
except
that
it
was
now
early
morning
,
and
that
,
whatever
*NL*
might
happen
next
,
it
was
proper
,
first
of
all
,
to
get
up
and
say
her
*NL*
prayers
.
She
was
the
more
inclined
to
devotion
from
the
grim
aspect
of
*NL*
the
chamber
and
its
furniture
,
especially
the
tall
,
stiff
chairs
;
one
*NL*
of
which
stood
close
by
her
bedside
,
and
looked
as
if
some
*NL*
old-fashioned
personage
had
been
sitting
there
all
night
,
and
had
*NL*
vanished
only
just
in
season
to
escape
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Phoebe
was
quite
dressed
,
she
peeped
out
of
the
window
,
and
saw
a
*NL*
rosebush
in
the
garden
.
Being
a
very
tall
one
,
and
of
luxuriant
*NL*
growth
,
it
had
been
propped
up
against
the
side
of
the
house
,
and
was
*NL*
literally
covered
with
a
rare
and
very
beautiful
species
of
white
rose
.
*NL*
A
large
portion
of
them
,
as
the
girl
afterwards
discovered
,
had
blight
*NL*
or
mildew
at
their
hearts
;
but
,
viewed
at
a
fair
distance
,
the
whole
*NL*
rosebush
looked
as
if
it
had
been
brought
from
Eden
that
very
summer
,
*NL*
together
with
the
mould
in
which
it
grew
.
The
truth
was
,
nevertheless
,
*NL*
that
it
had
been
planted
by
Alice
Pyncheon
,
--
she
was
Phoebe
's
*NL*
great-great-grand-aunt
,
--
in
soil
which
,
reckoning
only
its
cultivation
*NL*
as
a
garden-plat
,
was
now
unctuous
with
nearly
two
hundred
years
of
*NL*
vegetable
decay
.
Growing
as
they
did
,
however
,
out
of
the
old
earth
,
*NL*
the
flowers
still
sent
a
fresh
and
sweet
incense
up
to
their
Creator
;
*NL*
nor
could
it
have
been
the
less
pure
and
acceptable
because
Phoebe
's
*NL*
young
breath
mingled
with
it
,
as
the
fragrance
floated
past
the
window
.
*NL*
Hastening
down
the
creaking
and
carpetless
staircase
,
she
found
her
way
*NL*
into
the
garden
,
gathered
some
of
the
most
perfect
of
the
roses
,
and
*NL*
brought
them
to
her
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Phoebe
was
one
of
those
persons
who
possess
,
as
their
exclusive
*NL*
patrimony
,
the
gift
of
practical
arrangement
.
It
is
a
kind
of
natural
*NL*
magic
that
enables
these
favored
ones
to
bring
out
the
hidden
*NL*
capabilities
of
things
around
them
;
and
particularly
to
give
a
look
of
*NL*
comfort
and
habitableness
to
any
place
which
,
for
however
brief
a
*NL*
period
,
may
happen
to
be
their
home
.
A
wild
hut
of
underbrush
,
tossed
*NL*
together
by
wayfarers
through
the
primitive
forest
,
would
acquire
the
*NL*
home
aspect
by
one
night
's
lodging
of
such
a
woman
,
and
would
retain
it
*NL*
long
after
her
quiet
figure
had
disappeared
into
the
surrounding
shade
.
*NL*
No
less
a
portion
of
such
homely
witchcraft
was
requisite
to
reclaim
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
Phoebe
's
waste
,
cheerless
,
and
dusky
chamber
,
which
had
*NL*
been
untenanted
so
long
--
except
by
spiders
,
and
mice
,
and
rats
,
and
*NL*
ghosts
--
that
it
was
all
overgrown
with
the
desolation
which
watches
to
*NL*
obliterate
every
trace
of
man
's
happier
hours
.
What
was
precisely
*NL*
Phoebe
's
process
we
find
it
impossible
to
say
.
She
appeared
to
have
no
*NL*
preliminary
design
,
but
gave
a
touch
here
and
another
there
;
brought
*NL*
some
articles
of
furniture
to
light
and
dragged
others
into
the
shadow
;
*NL*
looped
up
or
let
down
a
window-curtain
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
half
an
*NL*
hour
,
had
fully
succeeded
in
throwing
a
kindly
and
hospitable
smile
*NL*
over
the
apartment
.
No
longer
ago
than
the
night
before
,
it
had
*NL*
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
the
old
maid
's
heart
;
for
there
was
*NL*
neither
sunshine
nor
household
fire
in
one
nor
the
other
,
and
,
save
for
*NL*
ghosts
and
ghostly
reminiscences
,
not
a
guest
,
for
many
years
gone
by
,
*NL*
had
entered
the
heart
or
the
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
still
another
peculiarity
of
this
inscrutable
charm
.
The
*NL*
bedchamber
,
no
doubt
,
was
a
chamber
of
very
great
and
varied
*NL*
experience
,
as
a
scene
of
human
life
:
the
joy
of
bridal
nights
had
*NL*
throbbed
itself
away
here
;
new
immortals
had
first
drawn
earthly
breath
*NL*
here
;
and
here
old
people
had
died
.
But
--
whether
it
were
the
white
*NL*
roses
,
or
whatever
the
subtile
influence
might
be
--
a
person
of
delicate
*NL*
instinct
would
have
known
at
once
that
it
was
now
a
maiden
's
*NL*
bedchamber
,
and
had
been
purified
of
all
former
evil
and
sorrow
by
her
*NL*
sweet
breath
and
happy
thoughts
.
Her
dreams
of
the
past
night
,
being
*NL*
such
cheerful
ones
,
had
exorcised
the
gloom
,
and
now
haunted
the
*NL*
chamber
in
its
stead
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
arranging
matters
to
her
satisfaction
,
Phoebe
emerged
from
her
*NL*
chamber
,
with
a
purpose
to
descend
again
into
the
garden
.
Besides
the
*NL*
rosebush
,
she
had
observed
several
other
species
of
flowers
growing
*NL*
there
in
a
wilderness
of
neglect
,
and
obstructing
one
another
's
*NL*
development
-LRB-
as
is
often
the
parallel
case
in
human
society
-RRB-
by
their
*NL*
uneducated
entanglement
and
confusion
.
At
the
head
of
the
stairs
,
*NL*
however
,
she
met
Hepzibah
,
who
,
it
being
still
early
,
invited
her
into
*NL*
a
room
which
she
would
probably
have
called
her
boudoir
,
had
her
*NL*
education
embraced
any
such
French
phrase
.
It
was
strewn
about
with
a
*NL*
few
old
books
,
and
a
work-basket
,
and
a
dusty
writing-desk
;
and
had
,
on
*NL*
one
side
,
a
large
black
article
of
furniture
,
of
very
strange
*NL*
appearance
,
which
the
old
gentlewoman
told
Phoebe
was
a
harpsichord
.
*NL*
It
looked
more
like
a
coffin
than
anything
else
;
and
,
indeed
,
--
not
*NL*
having
been
played
upon
,
or
opened
,
for
years
,
--
there
must
have
been
a
*NL*
vast
deal
of
dead
music
in
it
,
stifled
for
want
of
air
.
Human
finger
*NL*
was
hardly
known
to
have
touched
its
chords
since
the
days
of
Alice
*NL*
Pyncheon
,
who
had
learned
the
sweet
accomplishment
of
melody
in
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
bade
her
young
guest
sit
down
,
and
,
herself
taking
a
chair
*NL*
near
by
,
looked
as
earnestly
at
Phoebe
's
trim
little
figure
as
if
she
*NL*
expected
to
see
right
into
its
springs
and
motive
secrets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cousin
Phoebe
,
''
said
she
,
at
last
,
``
I
really
ca
n't
see
my
way
clear
to
*NL*
keep
you
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
,
however
,
had
not
the
inhospitable
bluntness
with
which
*NL*
they
may
strike
the
reader
;
for
the
two
relatives
,
in
a
talk
before
*NL*
bedtime
,
had
arrived
at
a
certain
degree
of
mutual
understanding
.
*NL*
Hepzibah
knew
enough
to
enable
her
to
appreciate
the
circumstances
*NL*
-LRB-
resulting
from
the
second
marriage
of
the
girl
's
mother
-RRB-
which
made
it
*NL*
desirable
for
Phoebe
to
establish
herself
in
another
home
.
Nor
did
she
*NL*
misinterpret
Phoebe
's
character
,
and
the
genial
activity
pervading
*NL*
it
,
--
one
of
the
most
valuable
traits
of
the
true
New
England
*NL*
woman
,
--
which
had
impelled
her
forth
,
as
might
be
said
,
to
seek
her
*NL*
fortune
,
but
with
a
self-respecting
purpose
to
confer
as
much
benefit
*NL*
as
she
could
anywise
receive
.
As
one
of
her
nearest
kindred
,
she
had
*NL*
naturally
betaken
herself
to
Hepzibah
,
with
no
idea
of
forcing
herself
*NL*
on
her
cousin
's
protection
,
but
only
for
a
visit
of
a
week
or
two
,
*NL*
which
might
be
indefinitely
extended
,
should
it
prove
for
the
happiness
*NL*
of
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Hepzibah
's
blunt
observation
,
therefore
,
Phoebe
replied
as
frankly
,
*NL*
and
more
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
cousin
,
I
can
not
tell
how
it
will
be
,
''
said
she
.
``
But
I
really
*NL*
think
we
may
suit
one
another
much
better
than
you
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
nice
girl
,
--
I
see
it
plainly
,
''
continued
Hepzibah
;
``
and
it
*NL*
is
not
any
question
as
to
that
point
which
makes
me
hesitate
.
But
,
*NL*
Phoebe
,
this
house
of
mine
is
but
a
melancholy
place
for
a
young
person
*NL*
to
be
in
.
It
lets
in
the
wind
and
rain
,
and
the
snow
,
too
,
in
the
*NL*
garret
and
upper
chambers
,
in
winter-time
,
but
it
never
lets
in
the
*NL*
sunshine
.
And
as
for
myself
,
you
see
what
I
am
,
--
a
dismal
and
lonesome
*NL*
old
woman
-LRB-
for
I
begin
to
call
myself
old
,
Phoebe
-RRB-
,
whose
temper
,
I
am
*NL*
afraid
,
is
none
of
the
best
,
and
whose
spirits
are
as
bad
as
can
be
!
I
*NL*
can
not
make
your
life
pleasant
,
Cousin
Phoebe
,
neither
can
I
so
much
as
*NL*
give
you
bread
to
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
find
me
a
cheerful
little
body
''
answered
Phoebe
,
smiling
,
and
*NL*
yet
with
a
kind
of
gentle
dignity
,
``
and
I
mean
to
earn
my
bread
.
You
*NL*
know
I
have
not
been
brought
up
a
Pyncheon
.
A
girl
learns
many
things
*NL*
in
a
New
England
village
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Phoebe
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
sighing
,
``
your
knowledge
would
do
but
*NL*
little
for
you
here
!
And
then
it
is
a
wretched
thought
that
you
should
*NL*
fling
away
your
young
days
in
a
place
like
this
.
Those
cheeks
would
*NL*
not
be
so
rosy
after
a
month
or
two
.
Look
at
my
face
!
''
and
,
indeed
,
*NL*
the
contrast
was
very
striking
,
--
``
you
see
how
pale
I
am
!
It
is
my
idea
*NL*
that
the
dust
and
continual
decay
of
these
old
houses
are
unwholesome
*NL*
for
the
lungs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
the
garden
,
--
the
flowers
to
be
taken
care
of
,
''
observed
*NL*
Phoebe
.
``
I
should
keep
myself
healthy
with
exercise
in
the
open
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
after
all
,
child
,
''
exclaimed
Hepzibah
,
suddenly
rising
,
as
if
to
*NL*
dismiss
the
subject
,
``
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
who
shall
be
a
guest
or
*NL*
inhabitant
of
the
old
Pyncheon
House
.
Its
master
is
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
Judge
Pyncheon
?
''
asked
Phoebe
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Judge
Pyncheon
!
''
answered
her
cousin
angrily
.
``
He
will
hardly
cross
*NL*
the
threshold
while
I
live
!
No
,
no
!
But
,
Phoebe
,
you
shall
see
the
face
*NL*
of
him
I
speak
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
in
quest
of
the
miniature
already
described
,
and
returned
with
*NL*
it
in
her
hand
.
Giving
it
to
Phoebe
,
she
watched
her
features
*NL*
narrowly
,
and
with
a
certain
jealousy
as
to
the
mode
in
which
the
girl
*NL*
would
show
herself
affected
by
the
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
like
the
face
?
''
asked
Hepzibah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
handsome
!
--
it
is
very
beautiful
!
''
said
Phoebe
admiringly
.
``
It
*NL*
is
as
sweet
a
face
as
a
man
's
can
be
,
or
ought
to
be
.
It
has
something
*NL*
of
a
child
's
expression
,
--
and
yet
not
childish
,
--
only
one
feels
so
very
*NL*
kindly
towards
him
!
He
ought
never
to
suffer
anything
.
One
would
bear
*NL*
much
for
the
sake
of
sparing
him
toil
or
sorrow
.
Who
is
it
,
Cousin
*NL*
Hepzibah
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
never
hear
,
''
whispered
her
cousin
,
bending
towards
her
,
``
of
*NL*
Clifford
Pyncheon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
.
I
thought
there
were
no
Pyncheons
left
,
except
yourself
and
*NL*
our
cousin
Jaffrey
,
''
answered
Phoebe
.
``
And
yet
I
seem
to
have
heard
*NL*
the
name
of
Clifford
Pyncheon
.
Yes
!
--
from
my
father
or
my
mother
;
but
*NL*
has
he
not
been
a
long
while
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
child
,
perhaps
he
has
!
''
said
Hepzibah
with
a
sad
,
hollow
*NL*
laugh
;
``
but
,
in
old
houses
like
this
,
you
know
,
dead
people
are
very
*NL*
apt
to
come
back
again
!
We
shall
see
.
And
,
Cousin
Phoebe
,
since
,
after
*NL*
all
that
I
have
said
,
your
courage
does
not
fail
you
,
we
will
not
part
*NL*
so
soon
.
You
are
welcome
,
my
child
,
for
the
present
,
to
such
a
home
as
*NL*
your
kinswoman
can
offer
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
measured
,
but
not
exactly
cold
assurance
of
a
hospitable
*NL*
purpose
,
Hepzibah
kissed
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
now
went
below
stairs
,
where
Phoebe
--
not
so
much
assuming
the
*NL*
office
as
attracting
it
to
herself
,
by
the
magnetism
of
innate
*NL*
fitness
--
took
the
most
active
part
in
preparing
breakfast
.
The
*NL*
mistress
of
the
house
,
meanwhile
,
as
is
usual
with
persons
of
her
stiff
*NL*
and
unmalleable
cast
,
stood
mostly
aside
;
willing
to
lend
her
aid
,
yet
*NL*
conscious
that
her
natural
inaptitude
would
be
likely
to
impede
the
*NL*
business
in
hand
.
Phoebe
and
the
fire
that
boiled
the
teakettle
were
*NL*
equally
bright
,
cheerful
,
and
efficient
,
in
their
respective
offices
.
*NL*
Hepzibah
gazed
forth
from
her
habitual
sluggishness
,
the
necessary
*NL*
result
of
long
solitude
,
as
from
another
sphere
.
She
could
not
help
*NL*
being
interested
,
however
,
and
even
amused
,
at
the
readiness
with
which
*NL*
her
new
inmate
adapted
herself
to
the
circumstances
,
and
brought
the
*NL*
house
,
moreover
,
and
all
its
rusty
old
appliances
,
into
a
suitableness
*NL*
for
her
purposes
.
Whatever
she
did
,
too
,
was
done
without
conscious
*NL*
effort
,
and
with
frequent
outbreaks
of
song
,
which
were
exceedingly
*NL*
pleasant
to
the
ear
.
This
natural
tunefulness
made
Phoebe
seem
like
a
*NL*
bird
in
a
shadowy
tree
;
or
conveyed
the
idea
that
the
stream
of
life
*NL*
warbled
through
her
heart
as
a
brook
sometimes
warbles
through
a
*NL*
pleasant
little
dell
.
It
betokened
the
cheeriness
of
an
active
*NL*
temperament
,
finding
joy
in
its
activity
,
and
,
therefore
,
rendering
it
*NL*
beautiful
;
it
was
a
New
England
trait
,
--
the
stern
old
stuff
of
*NL*
Puritanism
with
a
gold
thread
in
the
web
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
brought
out
some
old
silver
spoons
with
the
family
crest
upon
*NL*
them
,
and
a
china
tea-set
painted
over
with
grotesque
figures
of
man
,
*NL*
bird
,
and
beast
,
in
as
grotesque
a
landscape
.
These
pictured
people
*NL*
were
odd
humorists
,
in
a
world
of
their
own
,
--
a
world
of
vivid
*NL*
brilliancy
,
so
far
as
color
went
,
and
still
unfaded
,
although
the
*NL*
teapot
and
small
cups
were
as
ancient
as
the
custom
itself
of
*NL*
tea-drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
great-great-great-great-grandmother
had
these
cups
,
when
she
was
*NL*
married
,
''
said
Hepzibah
to
Phoebe
.
``
She
was
a
Davenport
,
of
a
good
*NL*
family
.
They
were
almost
the
first
teacups
ever
seen
in
the
colony
;
*NL*
and
if
one
of
them
were
to
be
broken
,
my
heart
would
break
with
it
.
*NL*
But
it
is
nonsense
to
speak
so
about
a
brittle
teacup
,
when
I
remember
*NL*
what
my
heart
has
gone
through
without
breaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cups
--
not
having
been
used
,
perhaps
,
since
Hepzibah
's
youth
--
had
*NL*
contracted
no
small
burden
of
dust
,
which
Phoebe
washed
away
with
so
*NL*
much
care
and
delicacy
as
to
satisfy
even
the
proprietor
of
this
*NL*
invaluable
china
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
nice
little
housewife
you
are
!
''
exclaimed
the
latter
,
smiling
,
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
frowning
so
prodigiously
that
the
smile
was
*NL*
sunshine
under
a
thunder-cloud
.
``
Do
you
do
other
things
as
well
?
Are
*NL*
you
as
good
at
your
book
as
you
are
at
washing
teacups
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
,
I
am
afraid
,
''
said
Phoebe
,
laughing
at
the
form
of
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
question
.
``
But
I
was
schoolmistress
for
the
little
children
*NL*
in
our
district
last
summer
,
and
might
have
been
so
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
't
is
all
very
well
!
''
observed
the
maiden
lady
,
drawing
herself
up
.
*NL*
``
But
these
things
must
have
come
to
you
with
your
mother
's
blood
.
I
*NL*
never
knew
a
Pyncheon
that
had
any
turn
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
very
queer
,
but
not
the
less
true
,
that
people
are
generally
*NL*
quite
as
vain
,
or
even
more
so
,
of
their
deficiencies
than
of
their
*NL*
available
gifts
;
as
was
Hepzibah
of
this
native
inapplicability
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
,
of
the
Pyncheons
to
any
useful
purpose
.
She
regarded
it
as
an
*NL*
hereditary
trait
;
and
so
,
perhaps
,
it
was
,
but
unfortunately
a
morbid
*NL*
one
,
such
as
is
often
generated
in
families
that
remain
long
above
the
*NL*
surface
of
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
they
left
the
breakfast-table
,
the
shop-bell
rang
sharply
,
and
*NL*
Hepzibah
set
down
the
remnant
of
her
final
cup
of
tea
,
with
a
look
of
*NL*
sallow
despair
that
was
truly
piteous
to
behold
.
In
cases
of
*NL*
distasteful
occupation
,
the
second
day
is
generally
worse
than
the
*NL*
first
.
We
return
to
the
rack
with
all
the
soreness
of
the
preceding
*NL*
torture
in
our
limbs
.
At
all
events
,
Hepzibah
had
fully
satisfied
*NL*
herself
of
the
impossibility
of
ever
becoming
wonted
to
this
peevishly
*NL*
obstreperous
little
bell
.
Ring
as
often
as
it
might
,
the
sound
always
*NL*
smote
upon
her
nervous
system
rudely
and
suddenly
.
And
especially
now
,
*NL*
while
,
with
her
crested
teaspoons
and
antique
china
,
she
was
flattering
*NL*
herself
with
ideas
of
gentility
,
she
felt
an
unspeakable
disinclination
*NL*
to
confront
a
customer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
trouble
yourself
,
dear
cousin
!
''
cried
Phoebe
,
starting
lightly
*NL*
up
.
``
I
am
shop-keeper
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
child
!
''
exclaimed
Hepzibah
.
``
What
can
a
little
country
girl
know
*NL*
of
such
matters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
have
done
all
the
shopping
for
the
family
at
our
village
store
,
''
*NL*
said
Phoebe
.
``
And
I
have
had
a
table
at
a
fancy
fair
,
and
made
better
*NL*
sales
than
anybody
.
These
things
are
not
to
be
learnt
;
they
depend
*NL*
upon
a
knack
that
comes
,
I
suppose
,
''
added
she
,
smiling
,
``
with
one
's
*NL*
mother
's
blood
.
You
shall
see
that
I
am
as
nice
a
little
saleswoman
as
*NL*
I
am
a
housewife
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentlewoman
stole
behind
Phoebe
,
and
peeped
from
the
passageway
*NL*
into
the
shop
,
to
note
how
she
would
manage
her
undertaking
.
It
was
a
*NL*
case
of
some
intricacy
.
A
very
ancient
woman
,
in
a
white
short
gown
*NL*
and
a
green
petticoat
,
with
a
string
of
gold
beads
about
her
neck
,
and
*NL*
what
looked
like
a
nightcap
on
her
head
,
had
brought
a
quantity
of
yarn
*NL*
to
barter
for
the
commodities
of
the
shop
.
She
was
probably
the
very
*NL*
last
person
in
town
who
still
kept
the
time-honored
spinning-wheel
in
*NL*
constant
revolution
.
It
was
worth
while
to
hear
the
croaking
and
*NL*
hollow
tones
of
the
old
lady
,
and
the
pleasant
voice
of
Phoebe
,
*NL*
mingling
in
one
twisted
thread
of
talk
;
and
still
better
to
contrast
*NL*
their
figures
,
--
so
light
and
bloomy
,
--
so
decrepit
and
dusky
,
--
with
only
*NL*
the
counter
betwixt
them
,
in
one
sense
,
but
more
than
threescore
years
,
*NL*
in
another
.
As
for
the
bargain
,
it
was
wrinkled
slyness
and
craft
*NL*
pitted
against
native
truth
and
sagacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
not
that
well
done
?
''
asked
Phoebe
,
laughing
,
when
the
customer
was
*NL*
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicely
done
,
indeed
,
child
!
''
answered
Hepzibah
.
``
I
could
not
have
*NL*
gone
through
with
it
nearly
so
well
.
As
you
say
,
it
must
be
a
knack
*NL*
that
belongs
to
you
on
the
mother
's
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
very
genuine
admiration
,
that
with
which
persons
too
shy
or
too
*NL*
awkward
to
take
a
due
part
in
the
bustling
world
regard
the
real
actors
*NL*
in
life
's
stirring
scenes
;
so
genuine
,
in
fact
,
that
the
former
are
*NL*
usually
fain
to
make
it
palatable
to
their
self-love
,
by
assuming
that
*NL*
these
active
and
forcible
qualities
are
incompatible
with
others
,
which
*NL*
they
choose
to
deem
higher
and
more
important
.
Thus
,
Hepzibah
was
well
*NL*
content
to
acknowledge
Phoebe
's
vastly
superior
gifts
as
a
*NL*
shop-keeper
'
--
she
listened
,
with
compliant
ear
,
to
her
suggestion
of
*NL*
various
methods
whereby
the
influx
of
trade
might
be
increased
,
and
*NL*
rendered
profitable
,
without
a
hazardous
outlay
of
capital
.
She
*NL*
consented
that
the
village
maiden
should
manufacture
yeast
,
both
liquid
*NL*
and
in
cakes
;
and
should
brew
a
certain
kind
of
beer
,
nectareous
to
the
*NL*
palate
,
and
of
rare
stomachic
virtues
;
and
,
moreover
,
should
bake
and
*NL*
exhibit
for
sale
some
little
spice-cakes
,
which
whosoever
tasted
would
*NL*
longingly
desire
to
taste
again
.
All
such
proofs
of
a
ready
mind
and
*NL*
skilful
handiwork
were
highly
acceptable
to
the
aristocratic
*NL*
hucksteress
,
so
long
as
she
could
murmur
to
herself
with
a
grim
smile
,
*NL*
and
a
half-natural
sigh
,
and
a
sentiment
of
mixed
wonder
,
pity
,
and
*NL*
growing
affection
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
nice
little
body
she
is
!
If
she
only
could
be
a
lady
;
too
--
but
*NL*
that
's
impossible
!
Phoebe
is
no
Pyncheon
.
She
takes
everything
from
*NL*
her
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Phoebe
's
not
being
a
lady
,
or
whether
she
were
a
lady
or
no
,
it
*NL*
was
a
point
,
perhaps
,
difficult
to
decide
,
but
which
could
hardly
have
*NL*
come
up
for
judgment
at
all
in
any
fair
and
healthy
mind
.
Out
of
New
*NL*
England
,
it
would
be
impossible
to
meet
with
a
person
combining
so
many
*NL*
ladylike
attributes
with
so
many
others
that
form
no
necessary
-LRB-
if
*NL*
compatible
-RRB-
part
of
the
character
.
She
shocked
no
canon
of
taste
;
she
*NL*
was
admirably
in
keeping
with
herself
,
and
never
jarred
against
*NL*
surrounding
circumstances
.
Her
figure
,
to
be
sure
,
--
so
small
as
to
be
*NL*
almost
childlike
,
and
so
elastic
that
motion
seemed
as
easy
or
easier
*NL*
to
it
than
rest
,
would
hardly
have
suited
one
's
idea
of
a
countess
.
*NL*
Neither
did
her
face
--
with
the
brown
ringlets
on
either
side
,
and
the
*NL*
slightly
piquant
nose
,
and
the
wholesome
bloom
,
and
the
clear
shade
of
*NL*
tan
,
and
the
half
dozen
freckles
,
friendly
remembrances
of
the
April
*NL*
sun
and
breeze
--
precisely
give
us
a
right
to
call
her
beautiful
.
But
*NL*
there
was
both
lustre
and
depth
in
her
eyes
.
She
was
very
pretty
;
as
*NL*
graceful
as
a
bird
,
and
graceful
much
in
the
same
way
;
as
pleasant
*NL*
about
the
house
as
a
gleam
of
sunshine
falling
on
the
floor
through
a
*NL*
shadow
of
twinkling
leaves
,
or
as
a
ray
of
firelight
that
dances
on
the
*NL*
wall
while
evening
is
drawing
nigh
.
Instead
of
discussing
her
claim
*NL*
to
rank
among
ladies
,
it
would
be
preferable
to
regard
Phoebe
as
the
*NL*
example
of
feminine
grace
and
availability
combined
,
in
a
state
of
*NL*
society
,
if
there
were
any
such
,
where
ladies
did
not
exist
.
There
it
*NL*
should
be
woman
's
office
to
move
in
the
midst
of
practical
affairs
,
and
*NL*
to
gild
them
all
,
the
very
homeliest
,
--
were
it
even
the
scouring
of
*NL*
pots
and
kettles
,
--
with
an
atmosphere
of
loveliness
and
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
sphere
of
Phoebe
.
To
find
the
born
and
educated
lady
,
on
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
we
need
look
no
farther
than
Hepzibah
,
our
forlorn
old
*NL*
maid
,
in
her
rustling
and
rusty
silks
,
with
her
deeply
cherished
and
*NL*
ridiculous
consciousness
of
long
descent
,
her
shadowy
claims
to
*NL*
princely
territory
,
and
,
in
the
way
of
accomplishment
,
her
*NL*
recollections
,
it
may
be
,
of
having
formerly
thrummed
on
a
harpsichord
,
*NL*
and
walked
a
minuet
,
and
worked
an
antique
tapestry-stitch
on
her
*NL*
sampler
.
It
was
a
fair
parallel
between
new
Plebeianism
and
old
*NL*
Gentility
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
really
seemed
as
if
the
battered
visage
of
the
House
of
the
Seven
*NL*
Gables
,
black
and
heavy-browed
as
it
still
certainly
looked
,
must
have
*NL*
shown
a
kind
of
cheerfulness
glimmering
through
its
dusky
windows
as
*NL*
Phoebe
passed
to
and
fro
in
the
interior
.
Otherwise
,
it
is
impossible
*NL*
to
explain
how
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
so
soon
became
aware
of
*NL*
the
girl
's
presence
.
There
was
a
great
run
of
custom
,
setting
steadily
*NL*
in
,
from
about
ten
o
'
clock
until
towards
noon
,
--
relaxing
,
somewhat
,
at
*NL*
dinner-time
,
but
recommencing
in
the
afternoon
,
and
,
finally
,
dying
*NL*
away
a
half
an
hour
or
so
before
the
long
day
's
sunset
.
One
of
the
*NL*
stanchest
patrons
was
little
Ned
Higgins
,
the
devourer
of
Jim
Crow
and
*NL*
the
elephant
,
who
to-day
signalized
his
omnivorous
prowess
by
*NL*
swallowing
two
dromedaries
and
a
locomotive
.
Phoebe
laughed
,
as
she
*NL*
summed
up
her
aggregate
of
sales
upon
the
slate
;
while
Hepzibah
,
first
*NL*
drawing
on
a
pair
of
silk
gloves
,
reckoned
over
the
sordid
accumulation
*NL*
of
copper
coin
,
not
without
silver
intermixed
,
that
had
jingled
into
*NL*
the
till
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
renew
our
stock
,
Cousin
Hepzibah
!
''
cried
the
little
*NL*
saleswoman
.
``
The
gingerbread
figures
are
all
gone
,
and
so
are
those
*NL*
Dutch
wooden
milkmaids
,
and
most
of
our
other
playthings
.
There
has
*NL*
been
constant
inquiry
for
cheap
raisins
,
and
a
great
cry
for
whistles
,
*NL*
and
trumpets
,
and
jew
's
-
harps
;
and
at
least
a
dozen
little
boys
have
*NL*
asked
for
molasses-candy
.
And
we
must
contrive
to
get
a
peck
of
russet
*NL*
apples
,
late
in
the
season
as
it
is
.
But
,
dear
cousin
,
what
an
*NL*
enormous
heap
of
copper
!
Positively
a
copper
mountain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
!
well
done
!
well
done
!
''
quoth
Uncle
Venner
,
who
had
taken
*NL*
occasion
to
shuffle
in
and
out
of
the
shop
several
times
in
the
course
*NL*
of
the
day
.
``
Here
's
a
girl
that
will
never
end
her
days
at
my
farm
!
*NL*
Bless
my
eyes
,
what
a
brisk
little
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Phoebe
is
a
nice
girl
!
''
said
Hepzibah
,
with
a
scowl
of
austere
*NL*
approbation
.
``
But
,
Uncle
Venner
,
you
have
known
the
family
a
great
*NL*
many
years
.
Can
you
tell
me
whether
there
ever
was
a
Pyncheon
whom
she
*NL*
takes
after
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
there
ever
was
,
''
answered
the
venerable
man
.
``
At
any
*NL*
rate
,
it
never
was
my
luck
to
see
her
like
among
them
,
nor
,
for
that
*NL*
matter
,
anywhere
else
.
I
've
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
,
not
only
*NL*
in
people
's
kitchens
and
back-yards
but
at
the
street-corners
,
and
on
*NL*
the
wharves
,
and
in
other
places
where
my
business
calls
me
;
and
I
'm
*NL*
free
to
say
,
Miss
Hepzibah
,
that
I
never
knew
a
human
creature
do
her
*NL*
work
so
much
like
one
of
God
's
angels
as
this
child
Phoebe
does
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Venner
's
eulogium
,
if
it
appear
rather
too
high-strained
for
the
*NL*
person
and
occasion
,
had
,
nevertheless
,
a
sense
in
which
it
was
both
*NL*
subtile
and
true
.
There
was
a
spiritual
quality
in
Phoebe
's
activity
.
*NL*
The
life
of
the
long
and
busy
day
--
spent
in
occupations
that
might
so
*NL*
easily
have
taken
a
squalid
and
ugly
aspect
--
had
been
made
pleasant
,
*NL*
and
even
lovely
,
by
the
spontaneous
grace
with
which
these
homely
*NL*
duties
seemed
to
bloom
out
of
her
character
;
so
that
labor
,
while
she
*NL*
dealt
with
it
,
had
the
easy
and
flexible
charm
of
play
.
Angels
do
not
*NL*
toil
,
but
let
their
good
works
grow
out
of
them
;
and
so
did
Phoebe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
relatives
--
the
young
maid
and
the
old
one
--
found
time
before
*NL*
nightfall
,
in
the
intervals
of
trade
,
to
make
rapid
advances
towards
*NL*
affection
and
confidence
.
A
recluse
,
like
Hepzibah
,
usually
displays
*NL*
remarkable
frankness
,
and
at
least
temporary
affability
,
on
being
*NL*
absolutely
cornered
,
and
brought
to
the
point
of
personal
intercourse
;
*NL*
like
the
angel
whom
Jacob
wrestled
with
,
she
is
ready
to
bless
you
when
*NL*
once
overcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentlewoman
took
a
dreary
and
proud
satisfaction
in
leading
*NL*
Phoebe
from
room
to
room
of
the
house
,
and
recounting
the
traditions
*NL*
with
which
,
as
we
may
say
,
the
walls
were
lugubriously
frescoed
.
She
*NL*
showed
the
indentations
made
by
the
lieutenant-governor
's
sword-hilt
in
*NL*
the
door-panels
of
the
apartment
where
old
Colonel
Pyncheon
,
a
dead
*NL*
host
,
had
received
his
affrighted
visitors
with
an
awful
frown
.
The
*NL*
dusky
terror
of
that
frown
,
Hepzibah
observed
,
was
thought
to
be
*NL*
lingering
ever
since
in
the
passageway
.
She
bade
Phoebe
step
into
one
*NL*
of
the
tall
chairs
,
and
inspect
the
ancient
map
of
the
Pyncheon
*NL*
territory
at
the
eastward
.
In
a
tract
of
land
on
which
she
laid
her
*NL*
finger
,
there
existed
a
silver
mine
,
the
locality
of
which
was
*NL*
precisely
pointed
out
in
some
memoranda
of
Colonel
Pyncheon
himself
,
*NL*
but
only
to
be
made
known
when
the
family
claim
should
be
recognized
by
*NL*
government
.
Thus
it
was
for
the
interest
of
all
New
England
that
the
*NL*
Pyncheons
should
have
justice
done
them
.
She
told
,
too
,
how
that
there
*NL*
was
undoubtedly
an
immense
treasure
of
English
guineas
hidden
somewhere
*NL*
about
the
house
,
or
in
the
cellar
,
or
possibly
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
should
happen
to
find
it
,
Phoebe
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
glancing
*NL*
aside
at
her
with
a
grim
yet
kindly
smile
,
``
we
will
tie
up
the
*NL*
shop-bell
for
good
and
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
cousin
,
''
answered
Phoebe
;
``
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
I
hear
*NL*
somebody
ringing
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
customer
was
gone
,
Hepzibah
talked
rather
vaguely
,
and
at
*NL*
great
length
,
about
a
certain
Alice
Pyncheon
,
who
had
been
exceedingly
*NL*
beautiful
and
accomplished
in
her
lifetime
,
a
hundred
years
ago
.
The
*NL*
fragrance
of
her
rich
and
delightful
character
still
lingered
about
the
*NL*
place
where
she
had
lived
,
as
a
dried
rose-bud
scents
the
drawer
where
*NL*
it
has
withered
and
perished
.
This
lovely
Alice
had
met
with
some
*NL*
great
and
mysterious
calamity
,
and
had
grown
thin
and
white
,
and
*NL*
gradually
faded
out
of
the
world
.
But
,
even
now
,
she
was
supposed
to
*NL*
haunt
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
and
,
a
great
many
times
,
--
especially
*NL*
when
one
of
the
Pyncheons
was
to
die
,
--
she
had
been
heard
playing
sadly
*NL*
and
beautifully
on
the
harpsichord
.
One
of
these
tunes
,
just
as
it
had
*NL*
sounded
from
her
spiritual
touch
,
had
been
written
down
by
an
amateur
of
*NL*
music
;
it
was
so
exquisitely
mournful
that
nobody
,
to
this
day
,
could
*NL*
bear
to
hear
it
played
,
unless
when
a
great
sorrow
had
made
them
know
*NL*
the
still
profounder
sweetness
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
the
same
harpsichord
that
you
showed
me
?
''
inquired
Phoebe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
same
,
''
said
Hepzibah
.
``
It
was
Alice
Pyncheon
's
harpsichord
.
*NL*
When
I
was
learning
music
,
my
father
would
never
let
me
open
it
.
So
,
*NL*
as
I
could
only
play
on
my
teacher
's
instrument
,
I
have
forgotten
all
*NL*
my
music
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
these
antique
themes
,
the
old
lady
began
to
talk
about
the
*NL*
daguerreotypist
,
whom
,
as
he
seemed
to
be
a
well-meaning
and
orderly
*NL*
young
man
,
and
in
narrow
circumstances
,
she
had
permitted
to
take
up
*NL*
his
residence
in
one
of
the
seven
gables
.
But
,
on
seeing
more
of
Mr.
*NL*
Holgrave
,
she
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
him
.
He
had
the
strangest
*NL*
companions
imaginable
;
men
with
long
beards
,
and
dressed
in
linen
*NL*
blouses
,
and
other
such
new-fangled
and
ill-fitting
garments
;
*NL*
reformers
,
temperance
lecturers
,
and
all
manner
of
cross-looking
*NL*
philanthropists
;
community-men
,
and
come-outers
,
as
Hepzibah
believed
,
*NL*
who
acknowledged
no
law
,
and
ate
no
solid
food
,
but
lived
on
the
scent
*NL*
of
other
people
's
cookery
,
and
turned
up
their
noses
at
the
fare
.
As
*NL*
for
the
daguerreotypist
,
she
had
read
a
paragraph
in
a
penny
paper
,
the
*NL*
other
day
,
accusing
him
of
making
a
speech
full
of
wild
and
*NL*
disorganizing
matter
,
at
a
meeting
of
his
banditti-like
associates
.
*NL*
For
her
own
part
,
she
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
practised
animal
*NL*
magnetism
,
and
,
if
such
things
were
in
fashion
nowadays
,
should
be
apt
*NL*
to
suspect
him
of
studying
the
Black
Art
up
there
in
his
lonesome
*NL*
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
dear
cousin
,
''
said
Phoebe
,
``
if
the
young
man
is
so
dangerous
,
why
*NL*
do
you
let
him
stay
?
If
he
does
nothing
worse
,
he
may
set
the
house
on
*NL*
fire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sometimes
,
''
answered
Hepzibah
,
``
I
have
seriously
made
it
a
*NL*
question
,
whether
I
ought
not
to
send
him
away
.
But
,
with
all
his
*NL*
oddities
,
he
is
a
quiet
kind
of
a
person
,
and
has
such
a
way
of
taking
*NL*
hold
of
one
's
mind
,
that
,
without
exactly
liking
him
-LRB-
for
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
enough
of
the
young
man
-RRB-
,
I
should
be
sorry
to
lose
sight
of
him
*NL*
entirely
.
A
woman
clings
to
slight
acquaintances
when
she
lives
so
*NL*
much
alone
as
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
Mr.
Holgrave
is
a
lawless
person
!
''
remonstrated
Phoebe
,
a
part
*NL*
of
whose
essence
it
was
to
keep
within
the
limits
of
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Hepzibah
carelessly
,
--
for
,
formal
as
she
was
,
still
,
in
her
*NL*
life
's
experience
,
she
had
gnashed
her
teeth
against
human
law
,
--
``
I
*NL*
suppose
he
has
a
law
of
his
own
!

VI
Maule
's
Well
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
AFTER
an
early
tea
,
the
little
country-girl
strayed
into
the
garden
.
*NL*
The
enclosure
had
formerly
been
very
extensive
,
but
was
now
contracted
*NL*
within
small
compass
,
and
hemmed
about
,
partly
by
high
wooden
fences
,
*NL*
and
partly
by
the
outbuildings
of
houses
that
stood
on
another
street
.
*NL*
In
its
centre
was
a
grass-plat
,
surrounding
a
ruinous
little
structure
,
*NL*
which
showed
just
enough
of
its
original
design
to
indicate
that
it
had
*NL*
once
been
a
summer-house
.
A
hop-vine
,
springing
from
last
year
's
root
,
*NL*
was
beginning
to
clamber
over
it
,
but
would
be
long
in
covering
the
*NL*
roof
with
its
green
mantle
.
Three
of
the
seven
gables
either
fronted
*NL*
or
looked
sideways
,
with
a
dark
solemnity
of
aspect
,
down
into
the
*NL*
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
black
,
rich
soil
had
fed
itself
with
the
decay
of
a
long
period
of
*NL*
time
;
such
as
fallen
leaves
,
the
petals
of
flowers
,
and
the
stalks
and
*NL*
seed
--
vessels
of
vagrant
and
lawless
plants
,
more
useful
after
their
*NL*
death
than
ever
while
flaunting
in
the
sun
.
The
evil
of
these
departed
*NL*
years
would
naturally
have
sprung
up
again
,
in
such
rank
weeds
*NL*
-LRB-
symbolic
of
the
transmitted
vices
of
society
-RRB-
as
are
always
prone
to
*NL*
root
themselves
about
human
dwellings
.
Phoebe
saw
,
however
,
that
their
*NL*
growth
must
have
been
checked
by
a
degree
of
careful
labor
,
bestowed
*NL*
daily
and
systematically
on
the
garden
.
The
white
double
rosebush
had
*NL*
evidently
been
propped
up
anew
against
the
house
since
the
commencement
*NL*
of
the
season
;
and
a
pear-tree
and
three
damson-trees
,
which
,
except
a
*NL*
row
of
currant-bushes
,
constituted
the
only
varieties
of
fruit
,
bore
*NL*
marks
of
the
recent
amputation
of
several
superfluous
or
defective
*NL*
limbs
.
There
were
also
a
few
species
of
antique
and
hereditary
*NL*
flowers
,
in
no
very
flourishing
condition
,
but
scrupulously
weeded
;
as
*NL*
if
some
person
,
either
out
of
love
or
curiosity
,
had
been
anxious
to
*NL*
bring
them
to
such
perfection
as
they
were
capable
of
attaining
.
The
*NL*
remainder
of
the
garden
presented
a
well-selected
assortment
of
*NL*
esculent
vegetables
,
in
a
praiseworthy
state
of
advancement
.
Summer
*NL*
squashes
almost
in
their
golden
blossom
;
cucumbers
,
now
evincing
a
*NL*
tendency
to
spread
away
from
the
main
stock
,
and
ramble
far
and
wide
;
*NL*
two
or
three
rows
of
string-beans
and
as
many
more
that
were
about
to
*NL*
festoon
themselves
on
poles
;
tomatoes
,
occupying
a
site
so
sheltered
*NL*
and
sunny
that
the
plants
were
already
gigantic
,
and
promised
an
early
*NL*
and
abundant
harvest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebe
wondered
whose
care
and
toil
it
could
have
been
that
had
planted
*NL*
these
vegetables
,
and
kept
the
soil
so
clean
and
orderly
.
Not
surely
*NL*
her
cousin
Hepzibah
's
,
who
had
no
taste
nor
spirits
for
the
lady-like
*NL*
employment
of
cultivating
flowers
,
and
--
with
her
recluse
habits
,
and
*NL*
tendency
to
shelter
herself
within
the
dismal
shadow
of
the
*NL*
house
--
would
hardly
have
come
forth
under
the
speck
of
open
sky
to
weed
*NL*
and
hoe
among
the
fraternity
of
beans
and
squashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
being
her
first
day
of
complete
estrangement
from
rural
objects
,
*NL*
Phoebe
found
an
unexpected
charm
in
this
little
nook
of
grass
,
and
*NL*
foliage
,
and
aristocratic
flowers
,
and
plebeian
vegetables
.
The
eye
of
*NL*
Heaven
seemed
to
look
down
into
it
pleasantly
,
and
with
a
peculiar
*NL*
smile
,
as
if
glad
to
perceive
that
nature
,
elsewhere
overwhelmed
,
and
*NL*
driven
out
of
the
dusty
town
,
had
here
been
able
to
retain
a
*NL*
breathing-place
.
The
spot
acquired
a
somewhat
wilder
grace
,
and
yet
a
*NL*
very
gentle
one
,
from
the
fact
that
a
pair
of
robins
had
built
their
*NL*
nest
in
the
pear-tree
,
and
were
making
themselves
exceedingly
busy
and
*NL*
happy
in
the
dark
intricacy
of
its
boughs
.
Bees
,
too
,
--
strange
to
*NL*
say
,
--
had
thought
it
worth
their
while
to
come
hither
,
possibly
from
*NL*
the
range
of
hives
beside
some
farm-house
miles
away
.
How
many
aerial
*NL*
voyages
might
they
have
made
,
in
quest
of
honey
,
or
honey-laden
,
*NL*
betwixt
dawn
and
sunset
!
Yet
,
late
as
it
now
was
,
there
still
arose
a
*NL*
pleasant
hum
out
of
one
or
two
of
the
squash-blossoms
,
in
the
depths
of
*NL*
which
these
bees
were
plying
their
golden
labor
.
There
was
one
other
*NL*
object
in
the
garden
which
Nature
might
fairly
claim
as
her
inalienable
*NL*
property
,
in
spite
of
whatever
man
could
do
to
render
it
his
own
.
This
*NL*
was
a
fountain
,
set
round
with
a
rim
of
old
mossy
stones
,
and
paved
,
in
*NL*
its
bed
,
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
sort
of
mosaic-work
of
variously
*NL*
colored
pebbles
.
The
play
and
slight
agitation
of
the
water
,
in
its
*NL*
upward
gush
,
wrought
magically
with
these
variegated
pebbles
,
and
made
*NL*
a
continually
shifting
apparition
of
quaint
figures
,
vanishing
too
*NL*
suddenly
to
be
definable
.
Thence
,
swelling
over
the
rim
of
moss-grown
*NL*
stones
,
the
water
stole
away
under
the
fence
,
through
what
we
regret
to
*NL*
call
a
gutter
,
rather
than
a
channel
.
Nor
must
we
forget
to
mention
a
*NL*
hen-coop
of
very
reverend
antiquity
that
stood
in
the
farther
corner
of
*NL*
the
garden
,
not
a
great
way
from
the
fountain
.
It
now
contained
only
*NL*
Chanticleer
,
his
two
wives
,
and
a
solitary
chicken
.
All
of
them
were
*NL*
pure
specimens
of
a
breed
which
had
been
transmitted
down
as
an
*NL*
heirloom
in
the
Pyncheon
family
,
and
were
said
,
while
in
their
prime
,
*NL*
to
have
attained
almost
the
size
of
turkeys
,
and
,
on
the
score
of
*NL*
delicate
flesh
,
to
be
fit
for
a
prince
's
table
.
In
proof
of
the
*NL*
authenticity
of
this
legendary
renown
,
Hepzibah
could
have
exhibited
*NL*
the
shell
of
a
great
egg
,
which
an
ostrich
need
hardly
have
been
*NL*
ashamed
of
.
Be
that
as
it
might
,
the
hens
were
now
scarcely
larger
*NL*
than
pigeons
,
and
had
a
queer
,
rusty
,
withered
aspect
,
and
a
gouty
kind
*NL*
of
movement
,
and
a
sleepy
and
melancholy
tone
throughout
all
the
*NL*
variations
of
their
clucking
and
cackling
.
It
was
evident
that
the
*NL*
race
had
degenerated
,
like
many
a
noble
race
besides
,
in
consequence
of
*NL*
too
strict
a
watchfulness
to
keep
it
pure
.
These
feathered
people
had
*NL*
existed
too
long
in
their
distinct
variety
;
a
fact
of
which
the
present
*NL*
representatives
,
judging
by
their
lugubrious
deportment
,
seemed
to
be
*NL*
aware
.
They
kept
themselves
alive
,
unquestionably
,
and
laid
now
and
*NL*
then
an
egg
,
and
hatched
a
chicken
;
not
for
any
pleasure
of
their
own
,
*NL*
but
that
the
world
might
not
absolutely
lose
what
had
once
been
so
*NL*
admirable
a
breed
of
fowls
.
The
distinguishing
mark
of
the
hens
was
a
*NL*
crest
of
lamentably
scanty
growth
,
in
these
latter
days
,
but
so
oddly
*NL*
and
wickedly
analogous
to
Hepzibah
's
turban
,
that
Phoebe
--
to
the
*NL*
poignant
distress
of
her
conscience
,
but
inevitably
--
was
led
to
fancy
a
*NL*
general
resemblance
betwixt
these
forlorn
bipeds
and
her
respectable
*NL*
relative
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
ran
into
the
house
to
get
some
crumbs
of
bread
,
cold
potatoes
,
*NL*
and
other
such
scraps
as
were
suitable
to
the
accommodating
appetite
of
*NL*
fowls
.
Returning
,
she
gave
a
peculiar
call
,
which
they
seemed
to
*NL*
recognize
.
The
chicken
crept
through
the
pales
of
the
coop
and
ran
,
*NL*
with
some
show
of
liveliness
,
to
her
feet
;
while
Chanticleer
and
the
*NL*
ladies
of
his
household
regarded
her
with
queer
,
sidelong
glances
,
and
*NL*
then
croaked
one
to
another
,
as
if
communicating
their
sage
opinions
of
*NL*
her
character
.
So
wise
,
as
well
as
antique
,
was
their
aspect
,
as
to
*NL*
give
color
to
the
idea
,
not
merely
that
they
were
the
descendants
of
a
*NL*
time-honored
race
,
but
that
they
had
existed
,
in
their
individual
*NL*
capacity
,
ever
since
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
was
founded
,
and
*NL*
were
somehow
mixed
up
with
its
destiny
.
They
were
a
species
of
*NL*
tutelary
sprite
,
or
Banshee
;
although
winged
and
feathered
differently
*NL*
from
most
other
guardian
angels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
you
odd
little
chicken
!
''
said
Phoebe
;
``
here
are
some
nice
crumbs
*NL*
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chicken
,
hereupon
,
though
almost
as
venerable
in
appearance
as
its
*NL*
mother
--
possessing
,
indeed
,
the
whole
antiquity
of
its
progenitors
in
*NL*
miniature
,
--
mustered
vivacity
enough
to
flutter
upward
and
alight
on
*NL*
Phoebe
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
little
fowl
pays
you
a
high
compliment
!
''
said
a
voice
behind
*NL*
Phoebe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
quickly
,
she
was
surprised
at
sight
of
a
young
man
,
who
had
*NL*
found
access
into
the
garden
by
a
door
opening
out
of
another
gable
*NL*
than
that
whence
she
had
emerged
.
He
held
a
hoe
in
his
hand
,
and
,
*NL*
while
Phoebe
was
gone
in
quest
of
the
crumbs
,
had
begun
to
busy
himself
*NL*
with
drawing
up
fresh
earth
about
the
roots
of
the
tomatoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
chicken
really
treats
you
like
an
old
acquaintance
,
''
continued
he
*NL*
in
a
quiet
way
,
while
a
smile
made
his
face
pleasanter
than
Phoebe
at
*NL*
first
fancied
it
.
``
Those
venerable
personages
in
the
coop
,
too
,
seem
*NL*
very
affably
disposed
.
You
are
lucky
to
be
in
their
good
graces
so
*NL*
soon
!
They
have
known
me
much
longer
,
but
never
honor
me
with
any
*NL*
familiarity
,
though
hardly
a
day
passes
without
my
bringing
them
food
.
*NL*
Miss
Hepzibah
,
I
suppose
,
will
interweave
the
fact
with
her
other
*NL*
traditions
,
and
set
it
down
that
the
fowls
know
you
to
be
a
Pyncheon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
secret
is
,
''
said
Phoebe
,
smiling
,
``
that
I
have
learned
how
to
talk
*NL*
with
hens
and
chickens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
these
hens
,
''
answered
the
young
man
,
--
``
these
hens
of
*NL*
aristocratic
lineage
would
scorn
to
understand
the
vulgar
language
of
a
*NL*
barn-yard
fowl
.
I
prefer
to
think
--
and
so
would
Miss
Hepzibah
--
that
*NL*
they
recognize
the
family
tone
.
For
you
are
a
Pyncheon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Phoebe
Pyncheon
,
''
said
the
girl
,
with
a
manner
of
some
*NL*
reserve
;
for
she
was
aware
that
her
new
acquaintance
could
be
no
other
*NL*
than
the
daguerreotypist
,
of
whose
lawless
propensities
the
old
maid
*NL*
had
given
her
a
disagreeable
idea
.
``
I
did
not
know
that
my
cousin
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
garden
was
under
another
person
's
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Holgrave
,
``
I
dig
,
and
hoe
,
and
weed
,
in
this
black
old
*NL*
earth
,
for
the
sake
of
refreshing
myself
with
what
little
nature
and
*NL*
simplicity
may
be
left
in
it
,
after
men
have
so
long
sown
and
reaped
*NL*
here
.
I
turn
up
the
earth
by
way
of
pastime
.
My
sober
occupation
,
so
*NL*
far
as
I
have
any
,
is
with
a
lighter
material
.
In
short
,
I
make
*NL*
pictures
out
of
sunshine
;
and
,
not
to
be
too
much
dazzled
with
my
own
*NL*
trade
,
I
have
prevailed
with
Miss
Hepzibah
to
let
me
lodge
in
one
of
*NL*
these
dusky
gables
.
It
is
like
a
bandage
over
one
's
eyes
,
to
come
into
*NL*
it
.
But
would
you
like
to
see
a
specimen
of
my
productions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
daguerreotype
likeness
,
do
you
mean
?
''
asked
Phoebe
with
less
*NL*
reserve
;
for
,
in
spite
of
prejudice
,
her
own
youthfulness
sprang
*NL*
forward
to
meet
his
.
``
I
do
n't
much
like
pictures
of
that
sort
,
--
they
*NL*
are
so
hard
and
stern
;
besides
dodging
away
from
the
eye
,
and
trying
to
*NL*
escape
altogether
.
They
are
conscious
of
looking
very
unamiable
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
and
therefore
hate
to
be
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
permit
me
,
''
said
the
artist
,
looking
at
Phoebe
,
``
I
should
*NL*
like
to
try
whether
the
daguerreotype
can
bring
out
disagreeable
traits
*NL*
on
a
perfectly
amiable
face
.
But
there
certainly
is
truth
in
what
you
*NL*
have
said
.
Most
of
my
likenesses
do
look
unamiable
;
but
the
very
*NL*
sufficient
reason
,
I
fancy
,
is
,
because
the
originals
are
so
.
There
is
*NL*
a
wonderful
insight
in
Heaven
's
broad
and
simple
sunshine
.
While
we
*NL*
give
it
credit
only
for
depicting
the
merest
surface
,
it
actually
*NL*
brings
out
the
secret
character
with
a
truth
that
no
painter
would
ever
*NL*
venture
upon
,
even
could
he
detect
it
.
There
is
,
at
least
,
no
flattery
*NL*
in
my
humble
line
of
art
.
Now
,
here
is
a
likeness
which
I
have
taken
*NL*
over
and
over
again
,
and
still
with
no
better
result
.
Yet
the
original
*NL*
wears
,
to
common
eyes
,
a
very
different
expression
.
It
would
gratify
*NL*
me
to
have
your
judgment
on
this
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
exhibited
a
daguerreotype
miniature
in
a
morocco
case
.
Phoebe
*NL*
merely
glanced
at
it
,
and
gave
it
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
the
face
,
''
she
replied
;
``
for
its
stern
eye
has
been
following
*NL*
me
about
all
day
.
It
is
my
Puritan
ancestor
,
who
hangs
yonder
in
the
*NL*
parlor
.
To
be
sure
,
you
have
found
some
way
of
copying
the
portrait
*NL*
without
its
black
velvet
cap
and
gray
beard
,
and
have
given
him
a
*NL*
modern
coat
and
satin
cravat
,
instead
of
his
cloak
and
band
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
him
improved
by
your
alterations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
have
seen
other
differences
had
you
looked
a
little
longer
,
''
*NL*
said
Holgrave
,
laughing
,
yet
apparently
much
struck
.
``
I
can
assure
you
*NL*
that
this
is
a
modern
face
,
and
one
which
you
will
very
probably
meet
.
*NL*
Now
,
the
remarkable
point
is
,
that
the
original
wears
,
to
the
world
's
*NL*
eye
,
--
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
to
his
most
intimate
friends
,
--
an
*NL*
exceedingly
pleasant
countenance
,
indicative
of
benevolence
,
openness
*NL*
of
heart
,
sunny
good-humor
,
and
other
praiseworthy
qualities
of
that
*NL*
cast
.
The
sun
,
as
you
see
,
tells
quite
another
story
,
and
will
not
be
*NL*
coaxed
out
of
it
,
after
half
a
dozen
patient
attempts
on
my
part
.
Here
*NL*
we
have
the
man
,
sly
,
subtle
,
hard
,
imperious
,
and
,
withal
,
cold
as
*NL*
ice
.
Look
at
that
eye
!
Would
you
like
to
be
at
its
mercy
?
At
that
*NL*
mouth
!
Could
it
ever
smile
?
And
yet
,
if
you
could
only
see
the
benign
*NL*
smile
of
the
original
!
It
is
so
much
the
more
unfortunate
,
as
he
is
a
*NL*
public
character
of
some
eminence
,
and
the
likeness
was
intended
to
be
*NL*
engraved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
see
it
any
more
,
''
observed
Phoebe
,
turning
away
*NL*
her
eyes
.
``
It
is
certainly
very
like
the
old
portrait
.
But
my
cousin
*NL*
Hepzibah
has
another
picture
,
--
a
miniature
.
If
the
original
is
still
*NL*
in
the
world
,
I
think
he
might
defy
the
sun
to
make
him
look
stern
and
*NL*
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
seen
that
picture
,
then
!
''
exclaimed
the
artist
,
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
much
interest
.
``
I
never
did
,
but
have
a
great
curiosity
*NL*
to
do
so
.
And
you
judge
favorably
of
the
face
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
never
was
a
sweeter
one
,
''
said
Phoebe
.
``
It
is
almost
too
soft
*NL*
and
gentle
for
a
man
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
nothing
wild
in
the
eye
?
''
continued
Holgrave
,
so
earnestly
*NL*
that
it
embarrassed
Phoebe
,
as
did
also
the
quiet
freedom
with
which
he
*NL*
presumed
on
their
so
recent
acquaintance
.
``
Is
there
nothing
dark
or
*NL*
sinister
anywhere
?
Could
you
not
conceive
the
original
to
have
been
*NL*
guilty
of
a
great
crime
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
nonsense
,
''
said
Phoebe
a
little
impatiently
,
``
for
us
to
talk
*NL*
about
a
picture
which
you
have
never
seen
.
You
mistake
it
for
some
*NL*
other
.
A
crime
,
indeed
!
Since
you
are
a
friend
of
my
cousin
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
,
you
should
ask
her
to
show
you
the
picture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
suit
my
purpose
still
better
to
see
the
original
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
daguerreotypist
coolly
.
``
As
to
his
character
,
we
need
not
discuss
its
*NL*
points
;
they
have
already
been
settled
by
a
competent
tribunal
,
or
one
*NL*
which
called
itself
competent
.
But
,
stay
!
Do
not
go
yet
,
if
you
*NL*
please
!
I
have
a
proposition
to
make
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebe
was
on
the
point
of
retreating
,
but
turned
back
,
with
some
*NL*
hesitation
;
for
she
did
not
exactly
comprehend
his
manner
,
although
,
on
*NL*
better
observation
,
its
feature
seemed
rather
to
be
lack
of
ceremony
*NL*
than
any
approach
to
offensive
rudeness
.
There
was
an
odd
kind
of
*NL*
authority
,
too
,
in
what
he
now
proceeded
to
say
,
rather
as
if
the
*NL*
garden
were
his
own
than
a
place
to
which
he
was
admitted
merely
by
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
courtesy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
agreeable
to
you
,
''
he
observed
,
``
it
would
give
me
pleasure
to
turn
*NL*
over
these
flowers
,
and
those
ancient
and
respectable
fowls
,
to
your
*NL*
care
.
Coming
fresh
from
country
air
and
occupations
,
you
will
soon
*NL*
feel
the
need
of
some
such
out-of-door
employment
.
My
own
sphere
does
*NL*
not
so
much
lie
among
flowers
.
You
can
trim
and
tend
them
,
therefore
,
*NL*
as
you
please
;
and
I
will
ask
only
the
least
trifle
of
a
blossom
,
now
*NL*
and
then
,
in
exchange
for
all
the
good
,
honest
kitchen
vegetables
with
*NL*
which
I
propose
to
enrich
Miss
Hepzibah
's
table
.
So
we
will
be
*NL*
fellow-laborers
,
somewhat
on
the
community
system
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silently
,
and
rather
surprised
at
her
own
compliance
,
Phoebe
*NL*
accordingly
betook
herself
to
weeding
a
flower-bed
,
but
busied
herself
*NL*
still
more
with
cogitations
respecting
this
young
man
,
with
whom
she
so
*NL*
unexpectedly
found
herself
on
terms
approaching
to
familiarity
.
She
*NL*
did
not
altogether
like
him
.
His
character
perplexed
the
little
*NL*
country-girl
,
as
it
might
a
more
practised
observer
;
for
,
while
the
*NL*
tone
of
his
conversation
had
generally
been
playful
,
the
impression
*NL*
left
on
her
mind
was
that
of
gravity
,
and
,
except
as
his
youth
modified
*NL*
it
,
almost
sternness
.
She
rebelled
,
as
it
were
,
against
a
certain
*NL*
magnetic
element
in
the
artist
's
nature
,
which
he
exercised
towards
*NL*
her
,
possibly
without
being
conscious
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
while
,
the
twilight
,
deepened
by
the
shadows
of
the
*NL*
fruit-trees
and
the
surrounding
buildings
,
threw
an
obscurity
over
the
*NL*
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
said
Holgrave
,
``
it
is
time
to
give
over
work
!
That
last
stroke
*NL*
of
the
hoe
has
cut
off
a
beanstalk
.
Good-night
,
Miss
Phoebe
Pyncheon
!
*NL*
Any
bright
day
,
if
you
will
put
one
of
those
rosebuds
in
your
hair
,
and
*NL*
come
to
my
rooms
in
Central
Street
,
I
will
seize
the
purest
ray
of
*NL*
sunshine
,
and
make
a
picture
of
the
flower
and
its
wearer
.
''
He
retired
*NL*
towards
his
own
solitary
gable
,
but
turned
his
head
,
on
reaching
the
*NL*
door
,
and
called
to
Phoebe
,
with
a
tone
which
certainly
had
laughter
in
*NL*
it
,
yet
which
seemed
to
be
more
than
half
in
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
careful
not
to
drink
at
Maule
's
well
!
''
said
he
.
``
Neither
drink
nor
*NL*
bathe
your
face
in
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maule
's
well
!
''
answered
Phoebe
.
``
Is
that
it
with
the
rim
of
mossy
*NL*
stones
?
I
have
no
thought
of
drinking
there
,
--
but
why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
rejoined
the
daguerreotypist
,
``
because
,
like
an
old
lady
's
cup
of
*NL*
tea
,
it
is
water
bewitched
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
vanished
;
and
Phoebe
,
lingering
a
moment
,
saw
a
glimmering
light
,
*NL*
and
then
the
steady
beam
of
a
lamp
,
in
a
chamber
of
the
gable
.
On
*NL*
returning
into
Hepzibah
's
apartment
of
the
house
,
she
found
the
*NL*
low-studded
parlor
so
dim
and
dusky
that
her
eyes
could
not
penetrate
*NL*
the
interior
.
She
was
indistinctly
aware
,
however
,
that
the
gaunt
*NL*
figure
of
the
old
gentlewoman
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
straight-backed
*NL*
chairs
,
a
little
withdrawn
from
the
window
,
the
faint
gleam
of
which
*NL*
showed
the
blanched
paleness
of
her
cheek
,
turned
sideways
towards
a
*NL*
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
light
a
lamp
,
Cousin
Hepzibah
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
,
if
you
please
,
my
dear
child
,
''
answered
Hepzibah
.
``
But
put
it
on
*NL*
the
table
in
the
corner
of
the
passage
.
My
eyes
are
weak
;
and
I
can
*NL*
seldom
bear
the
lamplight
on
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
an
instrument
is
the
human
voice
!
How
wonderfully
responsive
to
*NL*
every
emotion
of
the
human
soul
!
In
Hepzibah
's
tone
,
at
that
moment
,
*NL*
there
was
a
certain
rich
depth
and
moisture
,
as
if
the
words
,
*NL*
commonplace
as
they
were
,
had
been
steeped
in
the
warmth
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
Again
,
while
lighting
the
lamp
in
the
kitchen
,
Phoebe
fancied
that
her
*NL*
cousin
spoke
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
moment
,
cousin
!
''
answered
the
girl
.
``
These
matches
just
glimmer
,
*NL*
and
go
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
instead
of
a
response
from
Hepzibah
,
she
seemed
to
hear
the
murmur
*NL*
of
an
unknown
voice
.
It
was
strangely
indistinct
,
however
,
and
less
*NL*
like
articulate
words
than
an
unshaped
sound
,
such
as
would
be
the
*NL*
utterance
of
feeling
and
sympathy
,
rather
than
of
the
intellect
.
So
*NL*
vague
was
it
,
that
its
impression
or
echo
in
Phoebe
's
mind
was
that
of
*NL*
unreality
.
She
concluded
that
she
must
have
mistaken
some
other
sound
*NL*
for
that
of
the
human
voice
;
or
else
that
it
was
altogether
in
her
*NL*
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
set
the
lighted
lamp
in
the
passage
,
and
again
entered
the
parlor
.
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
form
,
though
its
sable
outline
mingled
with
the
dusk
,
was
*NL*
now
less
imperfectly
visible
.
In
the
remoter
parts
of
the
room
,
*NL*
however
,
its
walls
being
so
ill
adapted
to
reflect
light
,
there
was
*NL*
nearly
the
same
obscurity
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cousin
,
''
said
Phoebe
,
``
did
you
speak
to
me
just
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
child
!
''
replied
Hepzibah
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fewer
words
than
before
,
but
with
the
same
mysterious
music
in
them
!
*NL*
Mellow
,
melancholy
,
yet
not
mournful
,
the
tone
seemed
to
gush
up
out
of
*NL*
the
deep
well
of
Hepzibah
's
heart
,
all
steeped
in
its
profoundest
*NL*
emotion
.
There
was
a
tremor
in
it
,
too
,
that
--
as
all
strong
feeling
is
*NL*
electric
--
partly
communicated
itself
to
Phoebe
.
The
girl
sat
silently
*NL*
for
a
moment
.
But
soon
,
her
senses
being
very
acute
,
she
became
*NL*
conscious
of
an
irregular
respiration
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
room
.
*NL*
Her
physical
organization
,
moreover
,
being
at
once
delicate
and
*NL*
healthy
,
gave
her
a
perception
,
operating
with
almost
the
effect
of
a
*NL*
spiritual
medium
,
that
somebody
was
near
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
cousin
,
''
asked
she
,
overcoming
an
indefinable
reluctance
,
``
is
*NL*
there
not
some
one
in
the
room
with
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebe
,
my
dear
little
girl
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
*NL*
``
you
were
up
betimes
,
and
have
been
busy
all
day
.
Pray
go
to
bed
;
for
*NL*
I
am
sure
you
must
need
rest
.
I
will
sit
in
the
parlor
awhile
,
and
*NL*
collect
my
thoughts
.
It
has
been
my
custom
for
more
years
,
child
,
than
*NL*
you
have
lived
!
''
While
thus
dismissing
her
,
the
maiden
lady
stept
*NL*
forward
,
kissed
Phoebe
,
and
pressed
her
to
her
heart
,
which
beat
*NL*
against
the
girl
's
bosom
with
a
strong
,
high
,
and
tumultuous
swell
.
*NL*
How
came
there
to
be
so
much
love
in
this
desolate
old
heart
,
that
it
*NL*
could
afford
to
well
over
thus
abundantly
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodnight
,
cousin
,
''
said
Phoebe
,
strangely
affected
by
Hepzibah
's
*NL*
manner
.
``
If
you
begin
to
love
me
,
I
am
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
retired
to
her
chamber
,
but
did
not
soon
fall
asleep
,
nor
then
very
*NL*
profoundly
.
At
some
uncertain
period
in
the
depths
of
night
,
and
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
through
the
thin
veil
of
a
dream
,
she
was
conscious
of
a
*NL*
footstep
mounting
the
stairs
heavily
,
but
not
with
force
and
decision
.
*NL*
The
voice
of
Hepzibah
,
with
a
hush
through
it
,
was
going
up
along
with
*NL*
the
footsteps
;
and
,
again
,
responsive
to
her
cousin
's
voice
,
Phoebe
*NL*
heard
that
strange
,
vague
murmur
,
which
might
be
likened
to
an
*NL*
indistinct
shadow
of
human
utterance
.
*NL*

VII
The
Guest
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
Phoebe
awoke
,
--
which
she
did
with
the
early
twittering
of
the
*NL*
conjugal
couple
of
robins
in
the
pear-tree
,
--
she
heard
movements
below
*NL*
stairs
,
and
,
hastening
down
,
found
Hepzibah
already
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
She
stood
by
a
window
,
holding
a
book
in
close
contiguity
to
her
nose
,
*NL*
as
if
with
the
hope
of
gaining
an
olfactory
acquaintance
with
its
*NL*
contents
,
since
her
imperfect
vision
made
it
not
very
easy
to
read
*NL*
them
.
If
any
volume
could
have
manifested
its
essential
wisdom
in
the
*NL*
mode
suggested
,
it
would
certainly
have
been
the
one
now
in
Hepzibah
's
*NL*
hand
;
and
the
kitchen
,
in
such
an
event
,
would
forthwith
have
streamed
*NL*
with
the
fragrance
of
venison
,
turkeys
,
capons
,
larded
partridges
,
*NL*
puddings
,
cakes
,
and
Christmas
pies
,
in
all
manner
of
elaborate
mixture
*NL*
and
concoction
.
It
was
a
cookery
book
,
full
of
innumerable
old
*NL*
fashions
of
English
dishes
,
and
illustrated
with
engravings
,
which
*NL*
represented
the
arrangements
of
the
table
at
such
banquets
as
it
might
*NL*
have
befitted
a
nobleman
to
give
in
the
great
hall
of
his
castle
.
And
,
*NL*
amid
these
rich
and
potent
devices
of
the
culinary
art
-LRB-
not
one
of
*NL*
which
,
probably
,
had
been
tested
,
within
the
memory
of
any
man
's
*NL*
grandfather
-RRB-
,
poor
Hepzibah
was
seeking
for
some
nimble
little
titbit
,
*NL*
which
,
with
what
skill
she
had
,
and
such
materials
as
were
at
hand
,
she
*NL*
might
toss
up
for
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
she
put
aside
the
savory
volume
,
and
inquired
*NL*
of
Phoebe
whether
old
Speckle
,
as
she
called
one
of
the
hens
,
had
laid
*NL*
an
egg
the
preceding
day
.
Phoebe
ran
to
see
,
but
returned
without
the
*NL*
expected
treasure
in
her
hand
.
At
that
instant
,
however
,
the
blast
of
*NL*
a
fish-dealer
's
conch
was
heard
,
announcing
his
approach
along
the
*NL*
street
.
With
energetic
raps
at
the
shop-window
,
Hepzibah
summoned
the
*NL*
man
in
,
and
made
purchase
of
what
he
warranted
as
the
finest
mackerel
*NL*
in
his
cart
,
and
as
fat
a
one
as
ever
he
felt
with
his
finger
so
early
*NL*
in
the
season
.
Requesting
Phoebe
to
roast
some
coffee
,
--
which
she
*NL*
casually
observed
was
the
real
Mocha
,
and
so
long
kept
that
each
of
the
*NL*
small
berries
ought
to
be
worth
its
weight
in
gold
,
--
the
maiden
lady
*NL*
heaped
fuel
into
the
vast
receptacle
of
the
ancient
fireplace
in
such
*NL*
quantity
as
soon
to
drive
the
lingering
dusk
out
of
the
kitchen
.
The
*NL*
country-girl
,
willing
to
give
her
utmost
assistance
,
proposed
to
make
*NL*
an
Indian
cake
,
after
her
mother
's
peculiar
method
,
of
easy
*NL*
manufacture
,
and
which
she
could
vouch
for
as
possessing
a
richness
,
*NL*
and
,
if
rightly
prepared
,
a
delicacy
,
unequalled
by
any
other
mode
of
*NL*
breakfast-cake
.
Hepzibah
gladly
assenting
,
the
kitchen
was
soon
the
*NL*
scene
of
savory
preparation
.
Perchance
,
amid
their
proper
element
of
*NL*
smoke
,
which
eddied
forth
from
the
ill-constructed
chimney
,
the
ghosts
*NL*
of
departed
cook-maids
looked
wonderingly
on
,
or
peeped
down
the
great
*NL*
breadth
of
the
flue
,
despising
the
simplicity
of
the
projected
meal
,
*NL*
yet
ineffectually
pining
to
thrust
their
shadowy
hands
into
each
*NL*
inchoate
dish
.
The
half-starved
rats
,
at
any
rate
,
stole
visibly
out
*NL*
of
their
hiding-places
,
and
sat
on
their
hind-legs
,
snuffing
the
fumy
*NL*
atmosphere
,
and
wistfully
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
nibble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
had
no
natural
turn
for
cookery
,
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
had
*NL*
fairly
incurred
her
present
meagreness
by
often
choosing
to
go
without
*NL*
her
dinner
rather
than
be
attendant
on
the
rotation
of
the
spit
,
or
*NL*
ebullition
of
the
pot
.
Her
zeal
over
the
fire
,
therefore
,
was
quite
an
*NL*
heroic
test
of
sentiment
.
It
was
touching
,
and
positively
worthy
of
*NL*
tears
-LRB-
if
Phoebe
,
the
only
spectator
,
except
the
rats
and
ghosts
*NL*
aforesaid
,
had
not
been
better
employed
than
in
shedding
them
-RRB-
,
to
see
*NL*
her
rake
out
a
bed
of
fresh
and
glowing
coals
,
and
proceed
to
broil
the
*NL*
mackerel
.
Her
usually
pale
cheeks
were
all
ablaze
with
heat
and
hurry
.
*NL*
She
watched
the
fish
with
as
much
tender
care
and
minuteness
of
*NL*
attention
as
if
,
--
we
know
not
how
to
express
it
otherwise
,
--
as
if
her
*NL*
own
heart
were
on
the
gridiron
,
and
her
immortal
happiness
were
*NL*
involved
in
its
being
done
precisely
to
a
turn
!
*NL*
*NL*
Life
,
within
doors
,
has
few
pleasanter
prospects
than
a
neatly
arranged
*NL*
and
well-provisioned
breakfast-table
.
We
come
to
it
freshly
,
in
the
*NL*
dewy
youth
of
the
day
,
and
when
our
spiritual
and
sensual
elements
are
*NL*
in
better
accord
than
at
a
later
period
;
so
that
the
material
delights
*NL*
of
the
morning
meal
are
capable
of
being
fully
enjoyed
,
without
any
*NL*
very
grievous
reproaches
,
whether
gastric
or
conscientious
,
for
*NL*
yielding
even
a
trifle
overmuch
to
the
animal
department
of
our
nature
.
*NL*
The
thoughts
,
too
,
that
run
around
the
ring
of
familiar
guests
have
a
*NL*
piquancy
and
mirthfulness
,
and
oftentimes
a
vivid
truth
,
which
more
*NL*
rarely
find
their
way
into
the
elaborate
intercourse
of
dinner
.
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
small
and
ancient
table
,
supported
on
its
slender
and
*NL*
graceful
legs
,
and
covered
with
a
cloth
of
the
richest
damask
,
looked
*NL*
worthy
to
be
the
scene
and
centre
of
one
of
the
cheerfullest
of
*NL*
parties
.
The
vapor
of
the
broiled
fish
arose
like
incense
from
the
*NL*
shrine
of
a
barbarian
idol
,
while
the
fragrance
of
the
Mocha
might
have
*NL*
gratified
the
nostrils
of
a
tutelary
Lar
,
or
whatever
power
has
scope
*NL*
over
a
modern
breakfast-table
.
Phoebe
's
Indian
cakes
were
the
sweetest
*NL*
offering
of
all
,
--
in
their
hue
befitting
the
rustic
altars
of
the
*NL*
innocent
and
golden
age
,
--
or
,
so
brightly
yellow
were
they
,
resembling
*NL*
some
of
the
bread
which
was
changed
to
glistening
gold
when
Midas
tried
*NL*
to
eat
it
.
The
butter
must
not
be
forgotten
,
--
butter
which
Phoebe
*NL*
herself
had
churned
,
in
her
own
rural
home
,
and
brought
it
to
her
*NL*
cousin
as
a
propitiatory
gift
,
--
smelling
of
clover-blossoms
,
and
*NL*
diffusing
the
charm
of
pastoral
scenery
through
the
dark-panelled
*NL*
parlor
.
All
this
,
with
the
quaint
gorgeousness
of
the
old
china
cups
*NL*
and
saucers
,
and
the
crested
spoons
,
and
a
silver
cream-jug
-LRB-
Hepzibah
's
*NL*
only
other
article
of
plate
,
and
shaped
like
the
rudest
porringer
-RRB-
,
set
*NL*
out
a
board
at
which
the
stateliest
of
old
Colonel
Pyncheon
's
guests
*NL*
need
not
have
scorned
to
take
his
place
.
But
the
Puritan
's
face
*NL*
scowled
down
out
of
the
picture
,
as
if
nothing
on
the
table
pleased
his
*NL*
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
way
of
contributing
what
grace
she
could
,
Phoebe
gathered
some
roses
*NL*
and
a
few
other
flowers
,
possessing
either
scent
or
beauty
,
and
*NL*
arranged
them
in
a
glass
pitcher
,
which
,
having
long
ago
lost
its
*NL*
handle
,
was
so
much
the
fitter
for
a
flower-vase
.
The
early
*NL*
sunshine
--
as
fresh
as
that
which
peeped
into
Eve
's
bower
while
she
and
*NL*
Adam
sat
at
breakfast
there
--
came
twinkling
through
the
branches
of
the
*NL*
pear-tree
,
and
fell
quite
across
the
table
.
All
was
now
ready
.
There
*NL*
were
chairs
and
plates
for
three
.
A
chair
and
plate
for
Hepzibah
,
--
the
*NL*
same
for
Phoebe
,
--
but
what
other
guest
did
her
cousin
look
for
?
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
this
preparation
there
had
been
a
constant
tremor
in
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
frame
;
an
agitation
so
powerful
that
Phoebe
could
see
the
*NL*
quivering
of
her
gaunt
shadow
,
as
thrown
by
the
firelight
on
the
*NL*
kitchen
wall
,
or
by
the
sunshine
on
the
parlor
floor
.
Its
*NL*
manifestations
were
so
various
,
and
agreed
so
little
with
one
another
,
*NL*
that
the
girl
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
.
Sometimes
it
seemed
an
*NL*
ecstasy
of
delight
and
happiness
.
At
such
moments
,
Hepzibah
would
*NL*
fling
out
her
arms
,
and
infold
Phoebe
in
them
,
and
kiss
her
cheek
as
*NL*
tenderly
as
ever
her
mother
had
;
she
appeared
to
do
so
by
an
inevitable
*NL*
impulse
,
and
as
if
her
bosom
were
oppressed
with
tenderness
,
of
which
*NL*
she
must
needs
pour
out
a
little
,
in
order
to
gain
breathing-room
.
The
*NL*
next
moment
,
without
any
visible
cause
for
the
change
,
her
unwonted
joy
*NL*
shrank
back
,
appalled
,
as
it
were
,
and
clothed
itself
in
mourning
;
or
*NL*
it
ran
and
hid
itself
,
so
to
speak
,
in
the
dungeon
of
her
heart
,
where
*NL*
it
had
long
lain
chained
,
while
a
cold
,
spectral
sorrow
took
the
place
*NL*
of
the
imprisoned
joy
,
that
was
afraid
to
be
enfranchised
,
--
a
sorrow
as
*NL*
black
as
that
was
bright
.
She
often
broke
into
a
little
,
nervous
,
*NL*
hysteric
laugh
,
more
touching
than
any
tears
could
be
;
and
forthwith
,
*NL*
as
if
to
try
which
was
the
most
touching
,
a
gush
of
tears
would
follow
;
*NL*
or
perhaps
the
laughter
and
tears
came
both
at
once
,
and
surrounded
our
*NL*
poor
Hepzibah
,
in
a
moral
sense
,
with
a
kind
of
pale
,
dim
rainbow
.
*NL*
Towards
Phoebe
,
as
we
have
said
,
she
was
affectionate
,
--
far
tenderer
*NL*
than
ever
before
,
in
their
brief
acquaintance
,
except
for
that
one
kiss
*NL*
on
the
preceding
night
,
--
yet
with
a
continually
recurring
pettishness
*NL*
and
irritability
.
She
would
speak
sharply
to
her
;
then
,
throwing
aside
*NL*
all
the
starched
reserve
of
her
ordinary
manner
,
ask
pardon
,
and
the
*NL*
next
instant
renew
the
just-forgiven
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
when
their
mutual
labor
was
all
finished
,
she
took
Phoebe
's
*NL*
hand
in
her
own
trembling
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bear
with
me
,
my
dear
child
,
''
she
cried
;
``
for
truly
my
heart
is
full
*NL*
to
the
brim
!
Bear
with
me
;
for
I
love
you
,
Phoebe
,
though
I
speak
so
*NL*
roughly
.
Think
nothing
of
it
,
dearest
child
!
By
and
by
,
I
shall
be
*NL*
kind
,
and
only
kind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
cousin
,
can
not
you
tell
me
what
has
happened
?
''
asked
*NL*
Phoebe
,
with
a
sunny
and
tearful
sympathy
.
``
What
is
it
that
moves
you
*NL*
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
hush
!
He
is
coming
!
''
whispered
Hepzibah
,
hastily
wiping
her
*NL*
eyes
.
``
Let
him
see
you
first
,
Phoebe
;
for
you
are
young
and
rosy
,
and
*NL*
can
not
help
letting
a
smile
break
out
whether
or
no
.
He
always
liked
*NL*
bright
faces
!
And
mine
is
old
now
,
and
the
tears
are
hardly
dry
on
it
.
*NL*
He
never
could
abide
tears
.
There
;
draw
the
curtain
a
little
,
so
that
*NL*
the
shadow
may
fall
across
his
side
of
the
table
!
But
let
there
be
a
*NL*
good
deal
of
sunshine
,
too
;
for
he
never
was
fond
of
gloom
,
as
some
*NL*
people
are
.
He
has
had
but
little
sunshine
in
his
life
,
--
poor
*NL*
Clifford
,
--
and
,
oh
,
what
a
black
shadow
.
Poor
,
poor
Clifford
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
murmuring
in
an
undertone
,
as
if
speaking
rather
to
her
own
heart
*NL*
than
to
Phoebe
,
the
old
gentlewoman
stepped
on
tiptoe
about
the
room
,
*NL*
making
such
arrangements
as
suggested
themselves
at
the
crisis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
there
was
a
step
in
the
passage-way
,
above
stairs
.
Phoebe
*NL*
recognized
it
as
the
same
which
had
passed
upward
,
as
through
her
*NL*
dream
,
in
the
night-time
.
The
approaching
guest
,
whoever
it
might
be
,
*NL*
appeared
to
pause
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
;
he
paused
twice
or
*NL*
thrice
in
the
descent
;
he
paused
again
at
the
foot
.
Each
time
,
the
*NL*
delay
seemed
to
be
without
purpose
,
but
rather
from
a
forgetfulness
of
*NL*
the
purpose
which
had
set
him
in
motion
,
or
as
if
the
person
's
feet
*NL*
came
involuntarily
to
a
stand-still
because
the
motive-power
was
too
*NL*
feeble
to
sustain
his
progress
.
Finally
,
he
made
a
long
pause
at
the
*NL*
threshold
of
the
parlor
.
He
took
hold
of
the
knob
of
the
door
;
then
*NL*
loosened
his
grasp
without
opening
it
.
Hepzibah
,
her
hands
*NL*
convulsively
clasped
,
stood
gazing
at
the
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Cousin
Hepzibah
,
pray
do
n't
look
so
!
''
said
Phoebe
,
trembling
;
for
*NL*
her
cousin
's
emotion
,
and
this
mysteriously
reluctant
step
,
made
her
*NL*
feel
as
if
a
ghost
were
coming
into
the
room
.
``
You
really
frighten
me
!
*NL*
Is
something
awful
going
to
happen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
whispered
Hepzibah
.
``
Be
cheerful
!
whatever
may
happen
,
be
*NL*
nothing
but
cheerful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
final
pause
at
the
threshold
proved
so
long
,
that
Hepzibah
,
unable
*NL*
to
endure
the
suspense
,
rushed
forward
,
threw
open
the
door
,
and
led
in
*NL*
the
stranger
by
the
hand
.
At
the
first
glance
,
Phoebe
saw
an
elderly
*NL*
personage
,
in
an
old-fashioned
dressing-gown
of
faded
damask
,
and
*NL*
wearing
his
gray
or
almost
white
hair
of
an
unusual
length
.
It
quite
*NL*
overshadowed
his
forehead
,
except
when
he
thrust
it
back
,
and
stared
*NL*
vaguely
about
the
room
.
After
a
very
brief
inspection
of
his
face
,
it
*NL*
was
easy
to
conceive
that
his
footstep
must
necessarily
be
such
an
one
*NL*
as
that
which
,
slowly
and
with
as
indefinite
an
aim
as
a
child
's
first
*NL*
journey
across
a
floor
,
had
just
brought
him
hitherward
.
Yet
there
*NL*
were
no
tokens
that
his
physical
strength
might
not
have
sufficed
for
a
*NL*
free
and
determined
gait
.
It
was
the
spirit
of
the
man
that
could
not
*NL*
walk
.
The
expression
of
his
countenance
--
while
,
notwithstanding
it
had
*NL*
the
light
of
reason
in
it
--
seemed
to
waver
,
and
glimmer
,
and
nearly
to
*NL*
die
away
,
and
feebly
to
recover
itself
again
.
It
was
like
a
flame
*NL*
which
we
see
twinkling
among
half-extinguished
embers
;
we
gaze
at
it
*NL*
more
intently
than
if
it
were
a
positive
blaze
,
gushing
vividly
*NL*
upward
,
--
more
intently
,
but
with
a
certain
impatience
,
as
if
it
ought
*NL*
either
to
kindle
itself
into
satisfactory
splendor
,
or
be
at
once
*NL*
extinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
after
entering
the
room
,
the
guest
stood
still
,
*NL*
retaining
Hepzibah
's
hand
instinctively
,
as
a
child
does
that
of
the
*NL*
grown
person
who
guides
it
.
He
saw
Phoebe
,
however
,
and
caught
an
*NL*
illumination
from
her
youthful
and
pleasant
aspect
,
which
,
indeed
,
*NL*
threw
a
cheerfulness
about
the
parlor
,
like
the
circle
of
reflected
*NL*
brilliancy
around
the
glass
vase
of
flowers
that
was
standing
in
the
*NL*
sunshine
.
He
made
a
salutation
,
or
,
to
speak
nearer
the
truth
,
an
*NL*
ill-defined
,
abortive
attempt
at
curtsy
.
Imperfect
as
it
was
,
however
,
*NL*
it
conveyed
an
idea
,
or
,
at
least
,
gave
a
hint
,
of
indescribable
grace
,
*NL*
such
as
no
practised
art
of
external
manners
could
have
attained
.
It
*NL*
was
too
slight
to
seize
upon
at
the
instant
;
yet
,
as
recollected
*NL*
afterwards
,
seemed
to
transfigure
the
whole
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Clifford
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
in
the
tone
with
which
one
soothes
a
*NL*
wayward
infant
,
``
this
is
our
cousin
Phoebe
,
--
little
Phoebe
*NL*
Pyncheon
,
--
Arthur
's
only
child
,
you
know
.
She
has
come
from
the
*NL*
country
to
stay
with
us
awhile
;
for
our
old
house
has
grown
to
be
very
*NL*
lonely
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebe
--
Phoebe
Pyncheon
?
--
Phoebe
?
''
repeated
the
guest
,
with
a
strange
,
*NL*
sluggish
,
ill-defined
utterance
.
``
Arthur
's
child
!
Ah
,
I
forget
!
No
*NL*
matter
.
She
is
very
welcome
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
dear
Clifford
,
take
this
chair
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
leading
him
to
*NL*
his
place
.
``
Pray
,
Phoebe
,
lower
the
curtain
a
very
little
more
.
Now
*NL*
let
us
begin
breakfast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
guest
seated
himself
in
the
place
assigned
him
,
and
looked
*NL*
strangely
around
.
He
was
evidently
trying
to
grapple
with
the
present
*NL*
scene
,
and
bring
it
home
to
his
mind
with
a
more
satisfactory
*NL*
distinctness
.
He
desired
to
be
certain
,
at
least
,
that
he
was
here
,
in
*NL*
the
low-studded
,
cross-beamed
,
oaken-panelled
parlor
,
and
not
in
some
*NL*
other
spot
,
which
had
stereotyped
itself
into
his
senses
.
But
the
*NL*
effort
was
too
great
to
be
sustained
with
more
than
a
fragmentary
*NL*
success
.
Continually
,
as
we
may
express
it
,
he
faded
away
out
of
his
*NL*
place
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
his
mind
and
consciousness
took
their
*NL*
departure
,
leaving
his
wasted
,
gray
,
and
melancholy
figure
--
a
*NL*
substantial
emptiness
,
a
material
ghost
--
to
occupy
his
seat
at
table
.
*NL*
Again
,
after
a
blank
moment
,
there
would
be
a
flickering
taper-gleam
in
*NL*
his
eyeballs
.
It
betokened
that
his
spiritual
part
had
returned
,
and
*NL*
was
doing
its
best
to
kindle
the
heart
's
household
fire
,
and
light
up
*NL*
intellectual
lamps
in
the
dark
and
ruinous
mansion
,
where
it
was
doomed
*NL*
to
be
a
forlorn
inhabitant
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
of
these
moments
of
less
torpid
,
yet
still
imperfect
animation
,
*NL*
Phoebe
became
convinced
of
what
she
had
at
first
rejected
as
too
*NL*
extravagant
and
startling
an
idea
.
She
saw
that
the
person
before
her
*NL*
must
have
been
the
original
of
the
beautiful
miniature
in
her
cousin
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
possession
.
Indeed
,
with
a
feminine
eye
for
costume
,
she
*NL*
had
at
once
identified
the
damask
dressing-gown
,
which
enveloped
him
,
*NL*
as
the
same
in
figure
,
material
,
and
fashion
,
with
that
so
elaborately
*NL*
represented
in
the
picture
.
This
old
,
faded
garment
,
with
all
its
*NL*
pristine
brilliancy
extinct
,
seemed
,
in
some
indescribable
way
,
to
*NL*
translate
the
wearer
's
untold
misfortune
,
and
make
it
perceptible
to
*NL*
the
beholder
's
eye
.
It
was
the
better
to
be
discerned
,
by
this
*NL*
exterior
type
,
how
worn
and
old
were
the
soul
's
more
immediate
*NL*
garments
;
that
form
and
countenance
,
the
beauty
and
grace
of
which
had
*NL*
almost
transcended
the
skill
of
the
most
exquisite
of
artists
.
It
*NL*
could
the
more
adequately
be
known
that
the
soul
of
the
man
must
have
*NL*
suffered
some
miserable
wrong
,
from
its
earthly
experience
.
There
he
*NL*
seemed
to
sit
,
with
a
dim
veil
of
decay
and
ruin
betwixt
him
and
the
*NL*
world
,
but
through
which
,
at
flitting
intervals
,
might
be
caught
the
*NL*
same
expression
,
so
refined
,
so
softly
imaginative
,
which
*NL*
Malbone
--
venturing
a
happy
touch
,
with
suspended
breath
--
had
imparted
*NL*
to
the
miniature
!
There
had
been
something
so
innately
characteristic
*NL*
in
this
look
,
that
all
the
dusky
years
,
and
the
burden
of
unfit
*NL*
calamity
which
had
fallen
upon
him
,
did
not
suffice
utterly
to
destroy
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
had
now
poured
out
a
cup
of
deliciously
fragrant
coffee
,
and
*NL*
presented
it
to
her
guest
.
As
his
eyes
met
hers
,
he
seemed
bewildered
*NL*
and
disquieted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
you
,
Hepzibah
?
''
he
murmured
sadly
;
then
,
more
apart
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
unconscious
that
he
was
overheard
,
``
How
changed
!
how
changed
!
*NL*
And
is
she
angry
with
me
?
Why
does
she
bend
her
brow
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Hepzibah
!
It
was
that
wretched
scowl
which
time
and
her
*NL*
near-sightedness
,
and
the
fret
of
inward
discomfort
,
had
rendered
so
*NL*
habitual
that
any
vehemence
of
mood
invariably
evoked
it
.
But
at
the
*NL*
indistinct
murmur
of
his
words
her
whole
face
grew
tender
,
and
even
*NL*
lovely
,
with
sorrowful
affection
;
the
harshness
of
her
features
*NL*
disappeared
,
as
it
were
,
behind
the
warm
and
misty
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Angry
!
''
she
repeated
;
``
angry
with
you
,
Clifford
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
,
as
she
uttered
the
exclamation
,
had
a
plaintive
and
really
*NL*
exquisite
melody
thrilling
through
it
,
yet
without
subduing
a
certain
*NL*
something
which
an
obtuse
auditor
might
still
have
mistaken
for
*NL*
asperity
.
It
was
as
if
some
transcendent
musician
should
draw
a
*NL*
soul-thrilling
sweetness
out
of
a
cracked
instrument
,
which
makes
its
*NL*
physical
imperfection
heard
in
the
midst
of
ethereal
harmony
,
--
so
deep
*NL*
was
the
sensibility
that
found
an
organ
in
Hepzibah
's
voice
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
but
love
here
,
Clifford
,
''
she
added
,
--
``
nothing
but
*NL*
love
!
You
are
at
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
guest
responded
to
her
tone
by
a
smile
,
which
did
not
half
light
up
*NL*
his
face
.
Feeble
as
it
was
,
however
,
and
gone
in
a
moment
,
it
had
a
*NL*
charm
of
wonderful
beauty
.
It
was
followed
by
a
coarser
expression
;
or
*NL*
one
that
had
the
effect
of
coarseness
on
the
fine
mould
and
outline
of
*NL*
his
countenance
,
because
there
was
nothing
intellectual
to
temper
it
.
*NL*
It
was
a
look
of
appetite
.
He
ate
food
with
what
might
almost
be
*NL*
termed
voracity
;
and
seemed
to
forget
himself
,
Hepzibah
,
the
young
*NL*
girl
,
and
everything
else
around
him
,
in
the
sensual
enjoyment
which
*NL*
the
bountifully
spread
table
afforded
.
In
his
natural
system
,
though
*NL*
high-wrought
and
delicately
refined
,
a
sensibility
to
the
delights
of
*NL*
the
palate
was
probably
inherent
.
It
would
have
been
kept
in
check
,
*NL*
however
,
and
even
converted
into
an
accomplishment
,
and
one
of
the
*NL*
thousand
modes
of
intellectual
culture
,
had
his
more
ethereal
*NL*
characteristics
retained
their
vigor
.
But
as
it
existed
now
,
the
*NL*
effect
was
painful
and
made
Phoebe
droop
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
little
while
the
guest
became
sensible
of
the
fragrance
of
the
yet
*NL*
untasted
coffee
.
He
quaffed
it
eagerly
.
The
subtle
essence
acted
on
*NL*
him
like
a
charmed
draught
,
and
caused
the
opaque
substance
of
his
*NL*
animal
being
to
grow
transparent
,
or
,
at
least
,
translucent
;
so
that
a
*NL*
spiritual
gleam
was
transmitted
through
it
,
with
a
clearer
lustre
than
*NL*
hitherto
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
,
more
!
''
he
cried
,
with
nervous
haste
in
his
utterance
,
as
if
*NL*
anxious
to
retain
his
grasp
of
what
sought
to
escape
him
.
``
This
is
*NL*
what
I
need
!
Give
me
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Under
this
delicate
and
powerful
influence
he
sat
more
erect
,
and
*NL*
looked
out
from
his
eyes
with
a
glance
that
took
note
of
what
it
rested
*NL*
on
.
It
was
not
so
much
that
his
expression
grew
more
intellectual
;
*NL*
this
,
though
it
had
its
share
,
was
not
the
most
peculiar
effect
.
*NL*
Neither
was
what
we
call
the
moral
nature
so
forcibly
awakened
as
to
*NL*
present
itself
in
remarkable
prominence
.
But
a
certain
fine
temper
of
*NL*
being
was
now
not
brought
out
in
full
relief
,
but
changeably
and
*NL*
imperfectly
betrayed
,
of
which
it
was
the
function
to
deal
with
all
*NL*
beautiful
and
enjoyable
things
.
In
a
character
where
it
should
exist
*NL*
as
the
chief
attribute
,
it
would
bestow
on
its
possessor
an
exquisite
*NL*
taste
,
and
an
enviable
susceptibility
of
happiness
.
Beauty
would
be
*NL*
his
life
;
his
aspirations
would
all
tend
toward
it
;
and
,
allowing
his
*NL*
frame
and
physical
organs
to
be
in
consonance
,
his
own
developments
*NL*
would
likewise
be
beautiful
.
Such
a
man
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
sorrow
;
nothing
with
strife
;
nothing
with
the
martyrdom
which
,
in
an
*NL*
infinite
variety
of
shapes
,
awaits
those
who
have
the
heart
,
and
will
,
*NL*
and
conscience
,
to
fight
a
battle
with
the
world
.
To
these
heroic
*NL*
tempers
,
such
martyrdom
is
the
richest
meed
in
the
world
's
gift
.
To
*NL*
the
individual
before
us
,
it
could
only
be
a
grief
,
intense
in
due
*NL*
proportion
with
the
severity
of
the
infliction
.
He
had
no
right
to
be
*NL*
a
martyr
;
and
,
beholding
him
so
fit
to
be
happy
and
so
feeble
for
all
*NL*
other
purposes
,
a
generous
,
strong
,
and
noble
spirit
would
,
methinks
,
*NL*
have
been
ready
to
sacrifice
what
little
enjoyment
it
might
have
*NL*
planned
for
itself
,
--
it
would
have
flung
down
the
hopes
,
so
paltry
in
*NL*
its
regard
,
--
if
thereby
the
wintry
blasts
of
our
rude
sphere
might
come
*NL*
tempered
to
such
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
to
speak
it
harshly
or
scornfully
,
it
seemed
Clifford
's
nature
to
*NL*
be
a
Sybarite
.
It
was
perceptible
,
even
there
,
in
the
dark
old
parlor
,
*NL*
in
the
inevitable
polarity
with
which
his
eyes
were
attracted
towards
*NL*
the
quivering
play
of
sunbeams
through
the
shadowy
foliage
.
It
was
*NL*
seen
in
his
appreciating
notice
of
the
vase
of
flowers
,
the
scent
of
*NL*
which
he
inhaled
with
a
zest
almost
peculiar
to
a
physical
organization
*NL*
so
refined
that
spiritual
ingredients
are
moulded
in
with
it
.
It
was
*NL*
betrayed
in
the
unconscious
smile
with
which
he
regarded
Phoebe
,
whose
*NL*
fresh
and
maidenly
figure
was
both
sunshine
and
flowers
,
--
their
*NL*
essence
,
in
a
prettier
and
more
agreeable
mode
of
manifestation
.
Not
*NL*
less
evident
was
this
love
and
necessity
for
the
Beautiful
,
in
the
*NL*
instinctive
caution
with
which
,
even
so
soon
,
his
eyes
turned
away
from
*NL*
his
hostess
,
and
wandered
to
any
quarter
rather
than
come
back
.
It
was
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
misfortune
,
--
not
Clifford
's
fault
.
How
could
he
,
--
so
yellow
*NL*
as
she
was
,
so
wrinkled
,
so
sad
of
mien
,
with
that
odd
uncouthness
of
a
*NL*
turban
on
her
head
,
and
that
most
perverse
of
scowls
contorting
her
*NL*
brow
,
--
how
could
he
love
to
gaze
at
her
?
But
,
did
he
owe
her
no
*NL*
affection
for
so
much
as
she
had
silently
given
?
He
owed
her
nothing
.
*NL*
A
nature
like
Clifford
's
can
contract
no
debts
of
that
kind
.
It
is
--
we
*NL*
say
it
without
censure
,
nor
in
diminution
of
the
claim
which
it
*NL*
indefeasibly
possesses
on
beings
of
another
mould
--
it
is
always
selfish
*NL*
in
its
essence
;
and
we
must
give
it
leave
to
be
so
,
and
heap
up
our
*NL*
heroic
and
disinterested
love
upon
it
so
much
the
more
,
without
a
*NL*
recompense
.
Poor
Hepzibah
knew
this
truth
,
or
,
at
least
,
acted
on
the
*NL*
instinct
of
it
.
So
long
estranged
from
what
was
lovely
as
Clifford
had
*NL*
been
,
she
rejoiced
--
rejoiced
,
though
with
a
present
sigh
,
and
a
secret
*NL*
purpose
to
shed
tears
in
her
own
chamber
that
he
had
brighter
objects
*NL*
now
before
his
eyes
than
her
aged
and
uncomely
features
.
They
never
*NL*
possessed
a
charm
;
and
if
they
had
,
the
canker
of
her
grief
for
him
*NL*
would
long
since
have
destroyed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guest
leaned
back
in
his
chair
.
Mingled
in
his
countenance
with
a
*NL*
dreamy
delight
,
there
was
a
troubled
look
of
effort
and
unrest
.
He
was
*NL*
seeking
to
make
himself
more
fully
sensible
of
the
scene
around
him
;
*NL*
or
,
perhaps
,
dreading
it
to
be
a
dream
,
or
a
play
of
imagination
,
was
*NL*
vexing
the
fair
moment
with
a
struggle
for
some
added
brilliancy
and
*NL*
more
durable
illusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
pleasant
!
--
How
delightful
!
''
he
murmured
,
but
not
as
if
addressing
*NL*
any
one
.
``
Will
it
last
?
How
balmy
the
atmosphere
through
that
open
*NL*
window
!
An
open
window
!
How
beautiful
that
play
of
sunshine
!
Those
*NL*
flowers
,
how
very
fragrant
!
That
young
girl
's
face
,
how
cheerful
,
how
*NL*
blooming
!
--
a
flower
with
the
dew
on
it
,
and
sunbeams
in
the
dew-drops
!
*NL*
Ah
!
this
must
be
all
a
dream
!
A
dream
!
A
dream
!
But
it
has
quite
*NL*
hidden
the
four
stone
walls
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
face
darkened
,
as
if
the
shadow
of
a
cavern
or
a
dungeon
had
*NL*
come
over
it
;
there
was
no
more
light
in
its
expression
than
might
have
*NL*
come
through
the
iron
grates
of
a
prison-window
--
still
lessening
,
too
,
*NL*
as
if
he
were
sinking
farther
into
the
depths
.
Phoebe
-LRB-
being
of
that
*NL*
quickness
and
activity
of
temperament
that
she
seldom
long
refrained
*NL*
from
taking
a
part
,
and
generally
a
good
one
,
in
what
was
going
*NL*
forward
-RRB-
now
felt
herself
moved
to
address
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
a
new
kind
of
rose
,
which
I
found
this
morning
in
the
garden
,
''
*NL*
said
she
,
choosing
a
small
crimson
one
from
among
the
flowers
in
the
*NL*
vase
.
``
There
will
be
but
five
or
six
on
the
bush
this
season
.
This
is
*NL*
the
most
perfect
of
them
all
;
not
a
speck
of
blight
or
mildew
in
it
.
*NL*
And
how
sweet
it
is
!
--
sweet
like
no
other
rose
!
One
can
never
forget
*NL*
that
scent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
--
let
me
see
!
--
let
me
hold
it
!
''
cried
the
guest
,
eagerly
seizing
*NL*
the
flower
,
which
,
by
the
spell
peculiar
to
remembered
odors
,
brought
*NL*
innumerable
associations
along
with
the
fragrance
that
it
exhaled
.
*NL*
``
Thank
you
!
This
has
done
me
good
.
I
remember
how
I
used
to
prize
this
*NL*
flower
,
--
long
ago
,
I
suppose
,
very
long
ago
!
--
or
was
it
only
yesterday
?
*NL*
It
makes
me
feel
young
again
!
Am
I
young
?
Either
this
remembrance
is
*NL*
singularly
distinct
,
or
this
consciousness
strangely
dim
!
But
how
kind
*NL*
of
the
fair
young
girl
!
Thank
you
!
Thank
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
favorable
excitement
derived
from
this
little
crimson
rose
afforded
*NL*
Clifford
the
brightest
moment
which
he
enjoyed
at
the
breakfast-table
.
*NL*
It
might
have
lasted
longer
,
but
that
his
eyes
happened
,
soon
*NL*
afterwards
,
to
rest
on
the
face
of
the
old
Puritan
,
who
,
out
of
his
*NL*
dingy
frame
and
lustreless
canvas
,
was
looking
down
on
the
scene
like
a
*NL*
ghost
,
and
a
most
ill-tempered
and
ungenial
one
.
The
guest
made
an
*NL*
impatient
gesture
of
the
hand
,
and
addressed
Hepzibah
with
what
might
*NL*
easily
be
recognized
as
the
licensed
irritability
of
a
petted
member
of
*NL*
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hepzibah
!
--
Hepzibah
!
''
cried
he
with
no
little
force
and
distinctness
,
*NL*
``
why
do
you
keep
that
odious
picture
on
the
wall
?
Yes
,
yes
!
--
that
is
*NL*
precisely
your
taste
!
I
have
told
you
,
a
thousand
times
,
that
it
was
*NL*
the
evil
genius
of
the
house
!
--
my
evil
genius
particularly
!
Take
it
*NL*
down
,
at
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Clifford
,
''
said
Hepzibah
sadly
,
``
you
know
it
can
not
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
at
all
events
,
''
continued
he
,
still
speaking
with
some
energy
,
*NL*
``
pray
cover
it
with
a
crimson
curtain
,
broad
enough
to
hang
in
folds
,
*NL*
and
with
a
golden
border
and
tassels
.
I
can
not
bear
it
!
It
must
not
*NL*
stare
me
in
the
face
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
Clifford
,
the
picture
shall
be
covered
,
''
said
Hepzibah
*NL*
soothingly
.
``
There
is
a
crimson
curtain
in
a
trunk
above
stairs
,
--
a
*NL*
little
faded
and
moth-eaten
,
I
'm
afraid
,
--
but
Phoebe
and
I
will
do
*NL*
wonders
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
very
day
,
remember
''
said
he
;
and
then
added
,
in
a
low
,
*NL*
self-communing
voice
,
``
Why
should
we
live
in
this
dismal
house
at
all
?
*NL*
Why
not
go
to
the
South
of
France
?
--
to
Italy
?
--
Paris
,
Naples
,
Venice
,
*NL*
Rome
?
Hepzibah
will
say
we
have
not
the
means
.
A
droll
idea
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
to
himself
,
and
threw
a
glance
of
fine
sarcastic
meaning
*NL*
towards
Hepzibah
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
several
moods
of
feeling
,
faintly
as
they
were
marked
,
through
*NL*
which
he
had
passed
,
occurring
in
so
brief
an
interval
of
time
,
had
*NL*
evidently
wearied
the
stranger
.
He
was
probably
accustomed
to
a
sad
*NL*
monotony
of
life
,
not
so
much
flowing
in
a
stream
,
however
sluggish
,
as
*NL*
stagnating
in
a
pool
around
his
feet
.
A
slumberous
veil
diffused
*NL*
itself
over
his
countenance
,
and
had
an
effect
,
morally
speaking
,
on
*NL*
its
naturally
delicate
and
elegant
outline
,
like
that
which
a
brooding
*NL*
mist
,
with
no
sunshine
in
it
,
throws
over
the
features
of
a
landscape
.
*NL*
He
appeared
to
become
grosser
,
--
almost
cloddish
.
If
aught
of
interest
*NL*
or
beauty
--
even
ruined
beauty
--
had
heretofore
been
visible
in
this
man
,
*NL*
the
beholder
might
now
begin
to
doubt
it
,
and
to
accuse
his
own
*NL*
imagination
of
deluding
him
with
whatever
grace
had
flickered
over
that
*NL*
visage
,
and
whatever
exquisite
lustre
had
gleamed
in
those
filmy
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
had
quite
sunken
away
,
however
,
the
sharp
and
peevish
tinkle
*NL*
of
the
shop-bell
made
itself
audible
.
Striking
most
disagreeably
on
*NL*
Clifford
's
auditory
organs
and
the
characteristic
sensibility
of
his
*NL*
nerves
,
it
caused
him
to
start
upright
out
of
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
,
Hepzibah
!
what
horrible
disturbance
have
we
now
in
the
*NL*
house
?
''
cried
he
,
wreaking
his
resentful
impatience
--
as
a
matter
of
*NL*
course
,
and
a
custom
of
old
--
on
the
one
person
in
the
world
that
loved
*NL*
him
.
``
I
have
never
heard
such
a
hateful
clamor
!
Why
do
you
permit
it
?
*NL*
In
the
name
of
all
dissonance
,
what
can
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
remarkable
into
what
prominent
relief
--
even
as
if
a
dim
*NL*
picture
should
leap
suddenly
from
its
canvas
--
Clifford
's
character
was
*NL*
thrown
by
this
apparently
trifling
annoyance
.
The
secret
was
,
that
an
*NL*
individual
of
his
temper
can
always
be
pricked
more
acutely
through
his
*NL*
sense
of
the
beautiful
and
harmonious
than
through
his
heart
.
It
is
*NL*
even
possible
--
for
similar
cases
have
often
happened
--
that
if
Clifford
,
*NL*
in
his
foregoing
life
,
had
enjoyed
the
means
of
cultivating
his
taste
*NL*
to
its
utmost
perfectibility
,
that
subtile
attribute
might
,
before
this
*NL*
period
,
have
completely
eaten
out
or
filed
away
his
affections
.
Shall
*NL*
we
venture
to
pronounce
,
therefore
,
that
his
long
and
black
calamity
*NL*
may
not
have
had
a
redeeming
drop
of
mercy
at
the
bottom
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Clifford
,
I
wish
I
could
keep
the
sound
from
your
ears
,
''
said
*NL*
Hepzibah
,
patiently
,
but
reddening
with
a
painful
suffusion
of
shame
.
*NL*
``
It
is
very
disagreeable
even
to
me
.
But
,
do
you
know
,
Clifford
,
I
*NL*
have
something
to
tell
you
?
This
ugly
noise
,
--
pray
run
,
Phoebe
,
and
see
*NL*
who
is
there
!
--
this
naughty
little
tinkle
is
nothing
but
our
shop-bell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shop-bell
!
''
repeated
Clifford
,
with
a
bewildered
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
our
shop-bell
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
a
certain
natural
dignity
,
mingled
*NL*
with
deep
emotion
,
now
asserting
itself
in
her
manner
.
``
For
you
must
*NL*
know
,
dearest
Clifford
,
that
we
are
very
poor
.
And
there
was
no
other
*NL*
resource
,
but
either
to
accept
assistance
from
a
hand
that
I
would
push
*NL*
aside
-LRB-
and
so
would
you
!
-RRB-
were
it
to
offer
bread
when
we
were
dying
for
*NL*
it
,
--
no
help
,
save
from
him
,
or
else
to
earn
our
subsistence
with
my
*NL*
own
hands
!
Alone
,
I
might
have
been
content
to
starve
.
But
you
were
to
*NL*
be
given
back
to
me
!
Do
you
think
,
then
,
dear
Clifford
,
''
added
she
,
*NL*
with
a
wretched
smile
,
``
that
I
have
brought
an
irretrievable
disgrace
*NL*
on
the
old
house
,
by
opening
a
little
shop
in
the
front
gable
?
Our
*NL*
great-great-grandfather
did
the
same
,
when
there
was
far
less
need
!
Are
*NL*
you
ashamed
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shame
!
Disgrace
!
Do
you
speak
these
words
to
me
,
Hepzibah
?
''
said
*NL*
Clifford
,
--
not
angrily
,
however
;
for
when
a
man
's
spirit
has
been
*NL*
thoroughly
crushed
,
he
may
be
peevish
at
small
offences
,
but
never
*NL*
resentful
of
great
ones
.
So
he
spoke
with
only
a
grieved
emotion
.
``
It
*NL*
was
not
kind
to
say
so
,
Hepzibah
!
What
shame
can
befall
me
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
unnerved
man
--
he
that
had
been
born
for
enjoyment
,
but
had
*NL*
met
a
doom
so
very
wretched
--
burst
into
a
woman
's
passion
of
tears
.
It
*NL*
was
but
of
brief
continuance
,
however
;
soon
leaving
him
in
a
quiescent
,
*NL*
and
,
to
judge
by
his
countenance
,
not
an
uncomfortable
state
.
From
*NL*
this
mood
,
too
,
he
partially
rallied
for
an
instant
,
and
looked
at
*NL*
Hepzibah
with
a
smile
,
the
keen
,
half-derisory
purport
of
which
was
a
*NL*
puzzle
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
so
very
poor
,
Hepzibah
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
his
chair
being
deep
and
softly
cushioned
,
Clifford
fell
*NL*
asleep
.
Hearing
the
more
regular
rise
and
fall
of
his
breath
-LRB-
which
,
*NL*
however
,
even
then
,
instead
of
being
strong
and
full
,
had
a
feeble
kind
*NL*
of
tremor
,
corresponding
with
the
lack
of
vigor
in
his
*NL*
character
-RRB-
,
--
hearing
these
tokens
of
settled
slumber
,
Hepzibah
seized
*NL*
the
opportunity
to
peruse
his
face
more
attentively
than
she
had
yet
*NL*
dared
to
do
.
Her
heart
melted
away
in
tears
;
her
profoundest
spirit
*NL*
sent
forth
a
moaning
voice
,
low
,
gentle
,
but
inexpressibly
sad
.
In
*NL*
this
depth
of
grief
and
pity
she
felt
that
there
was
no
irreverence
in
*NL*
gazing
at
his
altered
,
aged
,
faded
,
ruined
face
.
But
no
sooner
was
she
*NL*
a
little
relieved
than
her
conscience
smote
her
for
gazing
curiously
at
*NL*
him
,
now
that
he
was
so
changed
;
and
,
turning
hastily
away
,
Hepzibah
*NL*
let
down
the
curtain
over
the
sunny
window
,
and
left
Clifford
to
*NL*
slumber
there
.

VIII
The
Pyncheon
of
To-day
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
PHOEBE
,
on
entering
the
shop
,
beheld
there
the
already
familiar
face
of
*NL*
the
little
devourer
--
if
we
can
reckon
his
mighty
deeds
aright
--
of
Jim
*NL*
Crow
,
the
elephant
,
the
camel
,
the
dromedaries
,
and
the
locomotive
.
*NL*
Having
expended
his
private
fortune
,
on
the
two
preceding
days
,
in
the
*NL*
purchase
of
the
above
unheard-of
luxuries
,
the
young
gentleman
's
*NL*
present
errand
was
on
the
part
of
his
mother
,
in
quest
of
three
eggs
*NL*
and
half
a
pound
of
raisins
.
These
articles
Phoebe
accordingly
*NL*
supplied
,
and
,
as
a
mark
of
gratitude
for
his
previous
patronage
,
and
a
*NL*
slight
super-added
morsel
after
breakfast
,
put
likewise
into
his
hand
a
*NL*
whale
!
The
great
fish
,
reversing
his
experience
with
the
prophet
of
*NL*
Nineveh
,
immediately
began
his
progress
down
the
same
red
pathway
of
*NL*
fate
whither
so
varied
a
caravan
had
preceded
him
.
This
remarkable
*NL*
urchin
,
in
truth
,
was
the
very
emblem
of
old
Father
Time
,
both
in
*NL*
respect
of
his
all-devouring
appetite
for
men
and
things
,
and
because
*NL*
he
,
as
well
as
Time
,
after
ingulfing
thus
much
of
creation
,
looked
*NL*
almost
as
youthful
as
if
he
had
been
just
that
moment
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
partly
closing
the
door
,
the
child
turned
back
,
and
mumbled
*NL*
something
to
Phoebe
,
which
,
as
the
whale
was
but
half
disposed
of
,
she
*NL*
could
not
perfectly
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
,
my
little
fellow
?
''
asked
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
wants
to
know
''
repeated
Ned
Higgins
more
distinctly
,
``
how
Old
*NL*
Maid
Pyncheon
's
brother
does
?
Folks
say
he
has
got
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cousin
Hepzibah
's
brother
?
''
exclaimed
Phoebe
,
surprised
at
this
*NL*
sudden
explanation
of
the
relationship
between
Hepzibah
and
her
guest
.
*NL*
``
Her
brother
!
And
where
can
he
have
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
boy
only
put
his
thumb
to
his
broad
snub-nose
,
with
that
*NL*
look
of
shrewdness
which
a
child
,
spending
much
of
his
time
in
the
*NL*
street
,
so
soon
learns
to
throw
over
his
features
,
however
*NL*
unintelligent
in
themselves
.
Then
as
Phoebe
continued
to
gaze
at
him
,
*NL*
without
answering
his
mother
's
message
,
he
took
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
child
went
down
the
steps
,
a
gentleman
ascended
them
,
and
made
*NL*
his
entrance
into
the
shop
.
It
was
the
portly
,
and
,
had
it
possessed
*NL*
the
advantage
of
a
little
more
height
,
would
have
been
the
stately
*NL*
figure
of
a
man
considerably
in
the
decline
of
life
,
dressed
in
a
black
*NL*
suit
of
some
thin
stuff
,
resembling
broadcloth
as
closely
as
possible
.
*NL*
A
gold-headed
cane
,
of
rare
Oriental
wood
,
added
materially
to
the
high
*NL*
respectability
of
his
aspect
,
as
did
also
a
neckcloth
of
the
utmost
*NL*
snowy
purity
,
and
the
conscientious
polish
of
his
boots
.
His
dark
,
*NL*
square
countenance
,
with
its
almost
shaggy
depth
of
eyebrows
,
was
*NL*
naturally
impressive
,
and
would
,
perhaps
,
have
been
rather
stern
,
had
*NL*
not
the
gentleman
considerately
taken
upon
himself
to
mitigate
the
*NL*
harsh
effect
by
a
look
of
exceeding
good-humor
and
benevolence
.
Owing
,
*NL*
however
,
to
a
somewhat
massive
accumulation
of
animal
substance
about
*NL*
the
lower
region
of
his
face
,
the
look
was
,
perhaps
,
unctuous
rather
*NL*
than
spiritual
,
and
had
,
so
to
speak
,
a
kind
of
fleshly
effulgence
,
not
*NL*
altogether
so
satisfactory
as
he
doubtless
intended
it
to
be
.
A
*NL*
susceptible
observer
,
at
any
rate
,
might
have
regarded
it
as
affording
*NL*
very
little
evidence
of
the
general
benignity
of
soul
whereof
it
*NL*
purported
to
be
the
outward
reflection
.
And
if
the
observer
chanced
to
*NL*
be
ill-natured
,
as
well
as
acute
and
susceptible
,
he
would
probably
*NL*
suspect
that
the
smile
on
the
gentleman
's
face
was
a
good
deal
akin
to
*NL*
the
shine
on
his
boots
,
and
that
each
must
have
cost
him
and
his
*NL*
boot-black
,
respectively
,
a
good
deal
of
hard
labor
to
bring
out
and
*NL*
preserve
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
stranger
entered
the
little
shop
,
where
the
projection
of
the
*NL*
second
story
and
the
thick
foliage
of
the
elm-tree
,
as
well
as
the
*NL*
commodities
at
the
window
,
created
a
sort
of
gray
medium
,
his
smile
*NL*
grew
as
intense
as
if
he
had
set
his
heart
on
counteracting
the
whole
*NL*
gloom
of
the
atmosphere
-LRB-
besides
any
moral
gloom
pertaining
to
Hepzibah
*NL*
and
her
inmates
-RRB-
by
the
unassisted
light
of
his
countenance
.
On
*NL*
perceiving
a
young
rose-bud
of
a
girl
,
instead
of
the
gaunt
presence
of
*NL*
the
old
maid
,
a
look
of
surprise
was
manifest
.
He
at
first
knit
his
*NL*
brows
;
then
smiled
with
more
unctuous
benignity
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
see
how
it
is
!
''
said
he
in
a
deep
voice
,
--
a
voice
which
,
had
it
*NL*
come
from
the
throat
of
an
uncultivated
man
,
would
have
been
gruff
,
*NL*
but
,
by
dint
of
careful
training
,
was
now
sufficiently
agreeable
,
--
``
I
*NL*
was
not
aware
that
Miss
Hepzibah
Pyncheon
had
commenced
business
under
*NL*
such
favorable
auspices
.
You
are
her
assistant
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
am
,
''
answered
Phoebe
,
and
added
,
with
a
little
air
of
*NL*
lady-like
assumption
-LRB-
for
,
civil
as
the
gentleman
was
,
he
evidently
*NL*
took
her
to
be
a
young
person
serving
for
wages
-RRB-
,
``
I
am
a
cousin
of
*NL*
Miss
Hepzibah
,
on
a
visit
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
cousin
?
--
and
from
the
country
?
Pray
pardon
me
,
then
,
''
said
the
*NL*
gentleman
,
bowing
and
smiling
,
as
Phoebe
never
had
been
bowed
to
nor
*NL*
smiled
on
before
;
``
in
that
case
,
we
must
be
better
acquainted
;
for
,
*NL*
unless
I
am
sadly
mistaken
,
you
are
my
own
little
kinswoman
likewise
!
*NL*
Let
me
see
,
--
Mary
?
--
Dolly
?
--
Phoebe
?
--
yes
,
Phoebe
is
the
name
!
Is
it
*NL*
possible
that
you
are
Phoebe
Pyncheon
,
only
child
of
my
dear
cousin
and
*NL*
classmate
,
Arthur
?
Ah
,
I
see
your
father
now
,
about
your
mouth
!
Yes
,
*NL*
yes
!
we
must
be
better
acquainted
!
I
am
your
kinsman
,
my
dear
.
Surely
*NL*
you
must
have
heard
of
Judge
Pyncheon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Phoebe
curtsied
in
reply
,
the
Judge
bent
forward
,
with
the
*NL*
pardonable
and
even
praiseworthy
purpose
--
considering
the
nearness
of
*NL*
blood
and
the
difference
of
age
--
of
bestowing
on
his
young
relative
a
*NL*
kiss
of
acknowledged
kindred
and
natural
affection
.
Unfortunately
*NL*
-LRB-
without
design
,
or
only
with
such
instinctive
design
as
gives
no
*NL*
account
of
itself
to
the
intellect
-RRB-
Phoebe
,
just
at
the
critical
*NL*
moment
,
drew
back
;
so
that
her
highly
respectable
kinsman
,
with
his
*NL*
body
bent
over
the
counter
and
his
lips
protruded
,
was
betrayed
into
*NL*
the
rather
absurd
predicament
of
kissing
the
empty
air
.
It
was
a
*NL*
modern
parallel
to
the
case
of
Ixion
embracing
a
cloud
,
and
was
so
much
*NL*
the
more
ridiculous
as
the
Judge
prided
himself
on
eschewing
all
airy
*NL*
matter
,
and
never
mistaking
a
shadow
for
a
substance
.
The
truth
*NL*
was
,
--
and
it
is
Phoebe
's
only
excuse
,
--
that
,
although
Judge
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
glowing
benignity
might
not
be
absolutely
unpleasant
to
the
feminine
*NL*
beholder
,
with
the
width
of
a
street
,
or
even
an
ordinary-sized
room
,
*NL*
interposed
between
,
yet
it
became
quite
too
intense
,
when
this
dark
,
*NL*
full-fed
physiognomy
-LRB-
so
roughly
bearded
,
too
,
that
no
razor
could
ever
*NL*
make
it
smooth
-RRB-
sought
to
bring
itself
into
actual
contact
with
the
*NL*
object
of
its
regards
.
The
man
,
the
sex
,
somehow
or
other
,
was
*NL*
entirely
too
prominent
in
the
Judge
's
demonstrations
of
that
sort
.
*NL*
Phoebe
's
eyes
sank
,
and
,
without
knowing
why
,
she
felt
herself
blushing
*NL*
deeply
under
his
look
.
Yet
she
had
been
kissed
before
,
and
without
*NL*
any
particular
squeamishness
,
by
perhaps
half
a
dozen
different
*NL*
cousins
,
younger
as
well
as
older
than
this
dark-browned
,
*NL*
grisly-bearded
,
white-neck-clothed
,
and
unctuously-benevolent
Judge
!
*NL*
Then
,
why
not
by
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
On
raising
her
eyes
,
Phoebe
was
startled
by
the
change
in
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
face
.
It
was
quite
as
striking
,
allowing
for
the
difference
*NL*
of
scale
,
as
that
betwixt
a
landscape
under
a
broad
sunshine
and
just
*NL*
before
a
thunder-storm
;
not
that
it
had
the
passionate
intensity
of
the
*NL*
latter
aspect
,
but
was
cold
,
hard
,
immitigable
,
like
a
day-long
*NL*
brooding
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
what
is
to
be
done
now
?
''
thought
the
country-girl
to
herself
.
*NL*
``
He
looks
as
if
there
were
nothing
softer
in
him
than
a
rock
,
nor
*NL*
milder
than
the
east
wind
!
I
meant
no
harm
!
Since
he
is
really
my
*NL*
cousin
,
I
would
have
let
him
kiss
me
,
if
I
could
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
all
at
once
,
it
struck
Phoebe
that
this
very
Judge
Pyncheon
was
*NL*
the
original
of
the
miniature
which
the
daguerreotypist
had
shown
her
*NL*
in
the
garden
,
and
that
the
hard
,
stern
,
relentless
look
,
now
on
his
*NL*
face
,
was
the
same
that
the
sun
had
so
inflexibly
persisted
in
bringing
*NL*
out
.
Was
it
,
therefore
,
no
momentary
mood
,
but
,
however
skilfully
*NL*
concealed
,
the
settled
temper
of
his
life
?
And
not
merely
so
,
but
was
*NL*
it
hereditary
in
him
,
and
transmitted
down
,
as
a
precious
heirloom
,
*NL*
from
that
bearded
ancestor
,
in
whose
picture
both
the
expression
and
,
*NL*
to
a
singular
degree
,
the
features
of
the
modern
Judge
were
shown
as
by
*NL*
a
kind
of
prophecy
?
A
deeper
philosopher
than
Phoebe
might
have
found
*NL*
something
very
terrible
in
this
idea
.
It
implied
that
the
weaknesses
*NL*
and
defects
,
the
bad
passions
,
the
mean
tendencies
,
and
the
moral
*NL*
diseases
which
lead
to
crime
are
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
*NL*
another
,
by
a
far
surer
process
of
transmission
than
human
law
has
been
*NL*
able
to
establish
in
respect
to
the
riches
and
honors
which
it
seeks
to
*NL*
entail
upon
posterity
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
it
happened
,
scarcely
had
Phoebe
's
eyes
rested
again
on
the
*NL*
Judge
's
countenance
than
all
its
ugly
sternness
vanished
;
and
she
found
*NL*
herself
quite
overpowered
by
the
sultry
,
dog-day
heat
,
as
it
were
,
of
*NL*
benevolence
,
which
this
excellent
man
diffused
out
of
his
great
heart
*NL*
into
the
surrounding
atmosphere
,
--
very
much
like
a
serpent
,
which
,
as
a
*NL*
preliminary
to
fascination
,
is
said
to
fill
the
air
with
his
peculiar
*NL*
odor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
that
,
Cousin
Phoebe
!
''
cried
he
,
with
an
emphatic
nod
of
*NL*
approbation
.
``
I
like
it
much
,
my
little
cousin
!
You
are
a
good
child
,
*NL*
and
know
how
to
take
care
of
yourself
.
A
young
girl
--
especially
if
she
*NL*
be
a
very
pretty
one
--
can
never
be
too
chary
of
her
lips
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
said
Phoebe
,
trying
to
laugh
the
matter
off
,
``
I
did
not
*NL*
mean
to
be
unkind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
whether
or
no
it
were
entirely
owing
to
the
inauspicious
*NL*
commencement
of
their
acquaintance
,
she
still
acted
under
a
certain
*NL*
reserve
,
which
was
by
no
means
customary
to
her
frank
and
genial
*NL*
nature
.
The
fantasy
would
not
quit
her
,
that
the
original
Puritan
,
of
*NL*
whom
she
had
heard
so
many
sombre
traditions
,
--
the
progenitor
of
the
*NL*
whole
race
of
New
England
Pyncheons
,
the
founder
of
the
House
of
the
*NL*
Seven
Gables
,
and
who
had
died
so
strangely
in
it
,
--
had
now
stept
into
*NL*
the
shop
.
In
these
days
of
off-hand
equipment
,
the
matter
was
easily
*NL*
enough
arranged
.
On
his
arrival
from
the
other
world
,
he
had
merely
*NL*
found
it
necessary
to
spend
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
a
barber
's
,
who
had
*NL*
trimmed
down
the
Puritan
's
full
beard
into
a
pair
of
grizzled
whiskers
,
*NL*
then
,
patronizing
a
ready-made
clothing
establishment
,
he
had
exchanged
*NL*
his
velvet
doublet
and
sable
cloak
,
with
the
richly
worked
band
under
*NL*
his
chin
,
for
a
white
collar
and
cravat
,
coat
,
vest
,
and
pantaloons
;
*NL*
and
lastly
,
putting
aside
his
steel-hilted
broadsword
to
take
up
a
*NL*
gold-headed
cane
,
the
Colonel
Pyncheon
of
two
centuries
ago
steps
*NL*
forward
as
the
Judge
of
the
passing
moment
!
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
Phoebe
was
far
too
sensible
a
girl
to
entertain
this
idea
in
*NL*
any
other
way
than
as
matter
for
a
smile
.
Possibly
,
also
,
could
the
*NL*
two
personages
have
stood
together
before
her
eye
,
many
points
of
*NL*
difference
would
have
been
perceptible
,
and
perhaps
only
a
general
*NL*
resemblance
.
The
long
lapse
of
intervening
years
,
in
a
climate
so
*NL*
unlike
that
which
had
fostered
the
ancestral
Englishman
,
must
*NL*
inevitably
have
wrought
important
changes
in
the
physical
system
of
his
*NL*
descendant
.
The
Judge
's
volume
of
muscle
could
hardly
be
the
same
as
*NL*
the
Colonel
's
;
there
was
undoubtedly
less
beef
in
him
.
Though
looked
*NL*
upon
as
a
weighty
man
among
his
contemporaries
in
respect
of
animal
*NL*
substance
,
and
as
favored
with
a
remarkable
degree
of
fundamental
*NL*
development
,
well
adapting
him
for
the
judicial
bench
,
we
conceive
that
*NL*
the
modern
Judge
Pyncheon
,
if
weighed
in
the
same
balance
with
his
*NL*
ancestor
,
would
have
required
at
least
an
old-fashioned
fifty-six
to
*NL*
keep
the
scale
in
equilibrio
.
Then
the
Judge
's
face
had
lost
the
ruddy
*NL*
English
hue
that
showed
its
warmth
through
all
the
duskiness
of
the
*NL*
Colonel
's
weather-beaten
cheek
,
and
had
taken
a
sallow
shade
,
the
*NL*
established
complexion
of
his
countrymen
.
If
we
mistake
not
,
moreover
,
*NL*
a
certain
quality
of
nervousness
had
become
more
or
less
manifest
,
even
*NL*
in
so
solid
a
specimen
of
Puritan
descent
as
the
gentleman
now
under
*NL*
discussion
.
As
one
of
its
effects
,
it
bestowed
on
his
countenance
a
*NL*
quicker
mobility
than
the
old
Englishman
's
had
possessed
,
and
keener
*NL*
vivacity
,
but
at
the
expense
of
a
sturdier
something
,
on
which
these
*NL*
acute
endowments
seemed
to
act
like
dissolving
acids
.
This
process
,
*NL*
for
aught
we
know
,
may
belong
to
the
great
system
of
human
progress
,
*NL*
which
,
with
every
ascending
footstep
,
as
it
diminishes
the
necessity
*NL*
for
animal
force
,
may
be
destined
gradually
to
spiritualize
us
,
by
*NL*
refining
away
our
grosser
attributes
of
body
.
If
so
,
Judge
Pyncheon
*NL*
could
endure
a
century
or
two
more
of
such
refinement
as
well
as
most
*NL*
other
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
similarity
,
intellectual
and
moral
,
between
the
Judge
and
his
*NL*
ancestor
appears
to
have
been
at
least
as
strong
as
the
resemblance
of
*NL*
mien
and
feature
would
afford
reason
to
anticipate
.
In
old
Colonel
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
funeral
discourse
the
clergyman
absolutely
canonized
his
*NL*
deceased
parishioner
,
and
opening
,
as
it
were
,
a
vista
through
the
roof
*NL*
of
the
church
,
and
thence
through
the
firmament
above
,
showed
him
*NL*
seated
,
harp
in
hand
,
among
the
crowned
choristers
of
the
spiritual
*NL*
world
.
On
his
tombstone
,
too
,
the
record
is
highly
eulogistic
;
nor
*NL*
does
history
,
so
far
as
he
holds
a
place
upon
its
page
,
assail
the
*NL*
consistency
and
uprightness
of
his
character
.
So
also
,
as
regards
the
*NL*
Judge
Pyncheon
of
to-day
,
neither
clergyman
,
nor
legal
critic
,
nor
*NL*
inscriber
of
tombstones
,
nor
historian
of
general
or
local
politics
,
*NL*
would
venture
a
word
against
this
eminent
person
's
sincerity
as
a
*NL*
Christian
,
or
respectability
as
a
man
,
or
integrity
as
a
judge
,
or
*NL*
courage
and
faithfulness
as
the
often-tried
representative
of
his
*NL*
political
party
.
But
,
besides
these
cold
,
formal
,
and
empty
words
of
*NL*
the
chisel
that
inscribes
,
the
voice
that
speaks
,
and
the
pen
that
*NL*
writes
,
for
the
public
eye
and
for
distant
time
,
--
and
which
inevitably
*NL*
lose
much
of
their
truth
and
freedom
by
the
fatal
consciousness
of
so
*NL*
doing
,
--
there
were
traditions
about
the
ancestor
,
and
private
diurnal
*NL*
gossip
about
the
Judge
,
remarkably
accordant
in
their
testimony
.
It
is
*NL*
often
instructive
to
take
the
woman
's
,
the
private
and
domestic
,
view
*NL*
of
a
public
man
;
nor
can
anything
be
more
curious
than
the
vast
*NL*
discrepancy
between
portraits
intended
for
engraving
and
the
*NL*
pencil-sketches
that
pass
from
hand
to
hand
behind
the
original
's
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
example
:
tradition
affirmed
that
the
Puritan
had
been
greedy
of
*NL*
wealth
;
the
Judge
,
too
,
with
all
the
show
of
liberal
expenditure
,
was
*NL*
said
to
be
as
close-fisted
as
if
his
gripe
were
of
iron
.
The
ancestor
*NL*
had
clothed
himself
in
a
grim
assumption
of
kindliness
,
a
rough
*NL*
heartiness
of
word
and
manner
,
which
most
people
took
to
be
the
genuine
*NL*
warmth
of
nature
,
making
its
way
through
the
thick
and
inflexible
hide
*NL*
of
a
manly
character
.
His
descendant
,
in
compliance
with
the
*NL*
requirements
of
a
nicer
age
,
had
etherealized
this
rude
benevolence
*NL*
into
that
broad
benignity
of
smile
wherewith
he
shone
like
a
noonday
*NL*
sun
along
the
streets
,
or
glowed
like
a
household
fire
in
the
*NL*
drawing-rooms
of
his
private
acquaintance
.
The
Puritan
--
if
not
belied
*NL*
by
some
singular
stories
,
murmured
,
even
at
this
day
,
under
the
*NL*
narrator
's
breath
--
had
fallen
into
certain
transgressions
to
which
men
*NL*
of
his
great
animal
development
,
whatever
their
faith
or
principles
,
*NL*
must
continue
liable
,
until
they
put
off
impurity
,
along
with
the
gross
*NL*
earthly
substance
that
involves
it
.
We
must
not
stain
our
page
with
*NL*
any
contemporary
scandal
,
to
a
similar
purport
,
that
may
have
been
*NL*
whispered
against
the
Judge
.
The
Puritan
,
again
,
an
autocrat
in
his
*NL*
own
household
,
had
worn
out
three
wives
,
and
,
merely
by
the
remorseless
*NL*
weight
and
hardness
of
his
character
in
the
conjugal
relation
,
had
sent
*NL*
them
,
one
after
another
,
broken-hearted
,
to
their
graves
.
Here
the
*NL*
parallel
,
in
some
sort
,
fails
.
The
Judge
had
wedded
but
a
single
wife
,
*NL*
and
lost
her
in
the
third
or
fourth
year
of
their
marriage
.
There
was
*NL*
a
fable
,
however
,
--
for
such
we
choose
to
consider
it
,
though
,
not
*NL*
impossibly
,
typical
of
Judge
Pyncheon
's
marital
deportment
,
--
that
the
*NL*
lady
got
her
death-blow
in
the
honeymoon
,
and
never
smiled
again
,
*NL*
because
her
husband
compelled
her
to
serve
him
with
coffee
every
*NL*
morning
at
his
bedside
,
in
token
of
fealty
to
her
liege-lord
and
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
too
fruitful
a
subject
,
this
of
hereditary
resemblances
,
--
the
*NL*
frequent
recurrence
of
which
,
in
a
direct
line
,
is
truly
unaccountable
,
*NL*
when
we
consider
how
large
an
accumulation
of
ancestry
lies
behind
*NL*
every
man
at
the
distance
of
one
or
two
centuries
.
We
shall
only
add
,
*NL*
therefore
,
that
the
Puritan
--
so
,
at
least
,
says
chimney-corner
*NL*
tradition
,
which
often
preserves
traits
of
character
with
marvellous
*NL*
fidelity
--
was
bold
,
imperious
,
relentless
,
crafty
;
laying
his
purposes
*NL*
deep
,
and
following
them
out
with
an
inveteracy
of
pursuit
that
knew
*NL*
neither
rest
nor
conscience
;
trampling
on
the
weak
,
and
,
when
essential
*NL*
to
his
ends
,
doing
his
utmost
to
beat
down
the
strong
.
Whether
the
*NL*
Judge
in
any
degree
resembled
him
,
the
further
progress
of
our
*NL*
narrative
may
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
any
of
the
items
in
the
above-drawn
parallel
occurred
to
*NL*
Phoebe
,
whose
country
birth
and
residence
,
in
truth
,
had
left
her
*NL*
pitifully
ignorant
of
most
of
the
family
traditions
,
which
lingered
,
*NL*
like
cobwebs
and
incrustations
of
smoke
,
about
the
rooms
and
*NL*
chimney-corners
of
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
Yet
there
was
a
*NL*
circumstance
,
very
trifling
in
itself
,
which
impressed
her
with
an
odd
*NL*
degree
of
horror
.
She
had
heard
of
the
anathema
flung
by
Maule
,
the
*NL*
executed
wizard
,
against
Colonel
Pyncheon
and
his
posterity
,
--
that
God
*NL*
would
give
them
blood
to
drink
,
--
and
likewise
of
the
popular
notion
,
*NL*
that
this
miraculous
blood
might
now
and
then
be
heard
gurgling
in
*NL*
their
throats
.
The
latter
scandal
--
as
became
a
person
of
sense
,
and
,
*NL*
more
especially
,
a
member
of
the
Pyncheon
family
--
Phoebe
had
set
down
*NL*
for
the
absurdity
which
it
unquestionably
was
.
But
ancient
*NL*
superstitions
,
after
being
steeped
in
human
hearts
and
embodied
in
*NL*
human
breath
,
and
passing
from
lip
to
ear
in
manifold
repetition
,
*NL*
through
a
series
of
generations
,
become
imbued
with
an
effect
of
homely
*NL*
truth
.
The
smoke
of
the
domestic
hearth
has
scented
them
through
and
*NL*
through
.
By
long
transmission
among
household
facts
,
they
grow
to
look
*NL*
like
them
,
and
have
such
a
familiar
way
of
making
themselves
at
home
*NL*
that
their
influence
is
usually
greater
than
we
suspect
.
Thus
it
*NL*
happened
,
that
when
Phoebe
heard
a
certain
noise
in
Judge
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
throat
,
--
rather
habitual
with
him
,
not
altogether
voluntary
,
yet
*NL*
indicative
of
nothing
,
unless
it
were
a
slight
bronchial
complaint
,
or
,
*NL*
as
some
people
hinted
,
an
apoplectic
symptom
,
--
when
the
girl
heard
this
*NL*
queer
and
awkward
ingurgitation
-LRB-
which
the
writer
never
did
hear
,
and
*NL*
therefore
can
not
describe
-RRB-
,
she
very
foolishly
started
,
and
clasped
her
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
it
was
exceedingly
ridiculous
in
Phoebe
to
be
discomposed
by
*NL*
such
a
trifle
,
and
still
more
unpardonable
to
show
her
discomposure
to
*NL*
the
individual
most
concerned
in
it
.
But
the
incident
chimed
in
so
*NL*
oddly
with
her
previous
fancies
about
the
Colonel
and
the
Judge
,
that
,
*NL*
for
the
moment
,
it
seemed
quite
to
mingle
their
identity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
you
,
young
woman
?
''
said
Judge
Pyncheon
,
giving
*NL*
her
one
of
his
harsh
looks
.
``
Are
you
afraid
of
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
,
sir
--
nothing
in
the
world
!
''
answered
Phoebe
,
with
a
*NL*
little
laugh
of
vexation
at
herself
.
``
But
perhaps
you
wish
to
speak
*NL*
with
my
cousin
Hepzibah
.
Shall
I
call
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
a
moment
,
if
you
please
,
''
said
the
Judge
,
again
beaming
sunshine
*NL*
out
of
his
face
.
``
You
seem
to
be
a
little
nervous
this
morning
.
The
*NL*
town
air
,
Cousin
Phoebe
,
does
not
agree
with
your
good
,
wholesome
*NL*
country
habits
.
Or
has
anything
happened
to
disturb
you
?
--
anything
*NL*
remarkable
in
Cousin
Hepzibah
's
family
?
--
An
arrival
,
eh
?
I
thought
*NL*
so
!
No
wonder
you
are
out
of
sorts
,
my
little
cousin
.
To
be
an
inmate
*NL*
with
such
a
guest
may
well
startle
an
innocent
young
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
quite
puzzle
me
,
sir
,
''
replied
Phoebe
,
gazing
inquiringly
at
the
*NL*
Judge
.
``
There
is
no
frightful
guest
in
the
house
,
but
only
a
poor
,
*NL*
gentle
,
childlike
man
,
whom
I
believe
to
be
Cousin
Hepzibah
's
brother
.
*NL*
I
am
afraid
-LRB-
but
you
,
sir
,
will
know
better
than
I
-RRB-
that
he
is
not
*NL*
quite
in
his
sound
senses
;
but
so
mild
and
quiet
he
seems
to
be
,
that
a
*NL*
mother
might
trust
her
baby
with
him
;
and
I
think
he
would
play
with
*NL*
the
baby
as
if
he
were
only
a
few
years
older
than
itself
.
He
startle
*NL*
me
!
--
Oh
,
no
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rejoice
to
hear
so
favorable
and
so
ingenuous
an
account
of
my
*NL*
cousin
Clifford
,
''
said
the
benevolent
Judge
.
``
Many
years
ago
,
when
we
*NL*
were
boys
and
young
men
together
,
I
had
a
great
affection
for
him
,
and
*NL*
still
feel
a
tender
interest
in
all
his
concerns
.
You
say
,
Cousin
*NL*
Phoebe
,
he
appears
to
be
weak
minded
.
Heaven
grant
him
at
least
enough
*NL*
of
intellect
to
repent
of
his
past
sins
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
,
I
fancy
,
''
observed
Phoebe
,
``
can
have
fewer
to
repent
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
it
possible
,
my
dear
,
''
rejoined
the
Judge
,
with
a
commiserating
*NL*
look
,
``
that
you
have
never
heard
of
Clifford
Pyncheon
?
--
that
you
know
*NL*
nothing
of
his
history
?
Well
,
it
is
all
right
;
and
your
mother
has
*NL*
shown
a
very
proper
regard
for
the
good
name
of
the
family
with
which
*NL*
she
connected
herself
.
Believe
the
best
you
can
of
this
unfortunate
*NL*
person
,
and
hope
the
best
!
It
is
a
rule
which
Christians
should
always
*NL*
follow
,
in
their
judgments
of
one
another
;
and
especially
is
it
right
*NL*
and
wise
among
near
relatives
,
whose
characters
have
necessarily
a
*NL*
degree
of
mutual
dependence
.
But
is
Clifford
in
the
parlor
?
I
will
*NL*
just
step
in
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
sir
,
I
had
better
call
my
cousin
Hepzibah
,
''
said
Phoebe
;
*NL*
hardly
knowing
,
however
,
whether
she
ought
to
obstruct
the
entrance
of
*NL*
so
affectionate
a
kinsman
into
the
private
regions
of
the
house
.
``
Her
*NL*
brother
seemed
to
be
just
falling
asleep
after
breakfast
;
and
I
am
sure
*NL*
she
would
not
like
him
to
be
disturbed
.
Pray
,
sir
,
let
me
give
her
*NL*
notice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Judge
showed
a
singular
determination
to
enter
unannounced
;
and
*NL*
as
Phoebe
,
with
the
vivacity
of
a
person
whose
movements
unconsciously
*NL*
answer
to
her
thoughts
,
had
stepped
towards
the
door
,
he
used
little
or
*NL*
no
ceremony
in
putting
her
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Miss
Phoebe
!
''
said
Judge
Pyncheon
in
a
voice
as
deep
as
a
*NL*
thunder-growl
,
and
with
a
frown
as
black
as
the
cloud
whence
it
issues
.
*NL*
``
Stay
you
here
!
I
know
the
house
,
and
know
my
cousin
Hepzibah
,
and
know
*NL*
her
brother
Clifford
likewise
.
--
nor
need
my
little
country
cousin
put
*NL*
herself
to
the
trouble
of
announcing
me
!
''
--
in
these
latter
words
,
by
*NL*
the
bye
,
there
were
symptoms
of
a
change
from
his
sudden
harshness
into
*NL*
his
previous
benignity
of
manner
.
``
I
am
at
home
here
,
Phoebe
,
you
must
*NL*
recollect
,
and
you
are
the
stranger
.
I
will
just
step
in
,
therefore
,
*NL*
and
see
for
myself
how
Clifford
is
,
and
assure
him
and
Hepzibah
of
my
*NL*
kindly
feelings
and
best
wishes
.
It
is
right
,
at
this
juncture
,
that
*NL*
they
should
both
hear
from
my
own
lips
how
much
I
desire
to
serve
them
.
*NL*
Ha
!
here
is
Hepzibah
herself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
case
.
The
vibrations
of
the
Judge
's
voice
had
reached
the
*NL*
old
gentlewoman
in
the
parlor
,
where
she
sat
,
with
face
averted
,
*NL*
waiting
on
her
brother
's
slumber
.
She
now
issued
forth
,
as
would
*NL*
appear
,
to
defend
the
entrance
,
looking
,
we
must
needs
say
,
amazingly
*NL*
like
the
dragon
which
,
in
fairy
tales
,
is
wont
to
be
the
guardian
over
*NL*
an
enchanted
beauty
.
The
habitual
scowl
of
her
brow
was
undeniably
too
*NL*
fierce
,
at
this
moment
,
to
pass
itself
off
on
the
innocent
score
of
*NL*
near-sightedness
;
and
it
was
bent
on
Judge
Pyncheon
in
a
way
that
*NL*
seemed
to
confound
,
if
not
alarm
him
,
so
inadequately
had
he
estimated
*NL*
the
moral
force
of
a
deeply
grounded
antipathy
.
She
made
a
repelling
*NL*
gesture
with
her
hand
,
and
stood
a
perfect
picture
of
prohibition
,
at
*NL*
full
length
,
in
the
dark
frame
of
the
doorway
.
But
we
must
betray
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
secret
,
and
confess
that
the
native
timorousness
of
her
*NL*
character
even
now
developed
itself
in
a
quick
tremor
,
which
,
to
her
*NL*
own
perception
,
set
each
of
her
joints
at
variance
with
its
fellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Possibly
,
the
Judge
was
aware
how
little
true
hardihood
lay
behind
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
formidable
front
.
At
any
rate
,
being
a
gentleman
of
steady
*NL*
nerves
,
he
soon
recovered
himself
,
and
failed
not
to
approach
his
*NL*
cousin
with
outstretched
hand
;
adopting
the
sensible
precaution
,
*NL*
however
,
to
cover
his
advance
with
a
smile
,
so
broad
and
sultry
,
that
,
*NL*
had
it
been
only
half
as
warm
as
it
looked
,
a
trellis
of
grapes
might
*NL*
at
once
have
turned
purple
under
its
summer-like
exposure
.
It
may
have
*NL*
been
his
purpose
,
indeed
,
to
melt
poor
Hepzibah
on
the
spot
,
as
if
she
*NL*
were
a
figure
of
yellow
wax
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hepzibah
,
my
beloved
cousin
,
I
am
rejoiced
!
''
exclaimed
the
Judge
most
*NL*
emphatically
.
``
Now
,
at
length
,
you
have
something
to
live
for
.
Yes
,
*NL*
and
all
of
us
,
let
me
say
,
your
friends
and
kindred
,
have
more
to
live
*NL*
for
than
we
had
yesterday
.
I
have
lost
no
time
in
hastening
to
offer
*NL*
any
assistance
in
my
power
towards
making
Clifford
comfortable
.
He
*NL*
belongs
to
us
all
.
I
know
how
much
he
requires
,
--
how
much
he
used
to
*NL*
require
,
--
with
his
delicate
taste
,
and
his
love
of
the
beautiful
.
*NL*
Anything
in
my
house
,
--
pictures
,
books
,
wine
,
luxuries
of
the
*NL*
table
,
--
he
may
command
them
all
!
It
would
afford
me
most
heartfelt
*NL*
gratification
to
see
him
!
Shall
I
step
in
,
this
moment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Hepzibah
,
her
voice
quivering
too
painfully
to
allow
of
*NL*
many
words
.
``
He
can
not
see
visitors
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
visitor
,
my
dear
cousin
!
--
do
you
call
me
so
?
''
cried
the
Judge
,
whose
*NL*
sensibility
,
it
seems
,
was
hurt
by
the
coldness
of
the
phrase
.
``
Nay
,
*NL*
then
,
let
me
be
Clifford
's
host
,
and
your
own
likewise
.
Come
at
once
*NL*
to
my
house
.
The
country
air
,
and
all
the
conveniences
,
--
I
may
say
*NL*
luxuries
,
--
that
I
have
gathered
about
me
,
will
do
wonders
for
him
.
And
*NL*
you
and
I
,
dear
Hepzibah
,
will
consult
together
,
and
watch
together
,
*NL*
and
labor
together
,
to
make
our
dear
Clifford
happy
.
Come
!
why
should
*NL*
we
make
more
words
about
what
is
both
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
on
my
part
?
*NL*
Come
to
me
at
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
these
so
hospitable
offers
,
and
such
generous
recognition
of
*NL*
the
claims
of
kindred
,
Phoebe
felt
very
much
in
the
mood
of
running
up
*NL*
to
Judge
Pyncheon
,
and
giving
him
,
of
her
own
accord
,
the
kiss
from
*NL*
which
she
had
so
recently
shrunk
away
.
It
was
quite
otherwise
with
*NL*
Hepzibah
;
the
Judge
's
smile
seemed
to
operate
on
her
acerbity
of
heart
*NL*
like
sunshine
upon
vinegar
,
making
it
ten
times
sourer
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clifford
,
''
said
she
,
--
still
too
agitated
to
utter
more
than
an
abrupt
*NL*
sentence
,
--
``
Clifford
has
a
home
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
Heaven
forgive
you
,
Hepzibah
,
''
said
Judge
Pyncheon
,
--
reverently
*NL*
lifting
his
eyes
towards
that
high
court
of
equity
to
which
he
*NL*
appealed
,
--
``
if
you
suffer
any
ancient
prejudice
or
animosity
to
weigh
*NL*
with
you
in
this
matter
.
I
stand
here
with
an
open
heart
,
willing
and
*NL*
anxious
to
receive
yourself
and
Clifford
into
it
.
Do
not
refuse
my
*NL*
good
offices
,
--
my
earnest
propositions
for
your
welfare
!
They
are
such
,
*NL*
in
all
respects
,
as
it
behooves
your
nearest
kinsman
to
make
.
It
will
*NL*
be
a
heavy
responsibility
,
cousin
,
if
you
confine
your
brother
to
this
*NL*
dismal
house
and
stifled
air
,
when
the
delightful
freedom
of
my
*NL*
country-seat
is
at
his
command
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
never
suit
Clifford
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
as
briefly
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woman
!
''
broke
forth
the
Judge
,
giving
way
to
his
resentment
,
``
what
is
*NL*
the
meaning
of
all
this
?
Have
you
other
resources
?
Nay
,
I
suspected
as
*NL*
much
!
Take
care
,
Hepzibah
,
take
care
!
Clifford
is
on
the
brink
of
as
*NL*
black
a
ruin
as
ever
befell
him
yet
!
But
why
do
I
talk
with
you
,
woman
*NL*
as
you
are
?
Make
way
!
--
I
must
see
Clifford
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
spread
out
her
gaunt
figure
across
the
door
,
and
seemed
really
*NL*
to
increase
in
bulk
;
looking
the
more
terrible
,
also
,
because
there
was
*NL*
so
much
terror
and
agitation
in
her
heart
.
But
Judge
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
evident
purpose
of
forcing
a
passage
was
interrupted
by
a
voice
from
*NL*
the
inner
room
;
a
weak
,
tremulous
,
wailing
voice
,
indicating
helpless
*NL*
alarm
,
with
no
more
energy
for
self-defence
than
belongs
to
a
*NL*
frightened
infant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hepzibah
,
Hepzibah
!
''
cried
the
voice
;
``
go
down
on
your
knees
to
him
!
*NL*
Kiss
his
feet
!
Entreat
him
not
to
come
in
!
Oh
,
let
him
have
mercy
on
*NL*
me
!
Mercy
!
mercy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
instant
,
it
appeared
doubtful
whether
it
were
not
the
Judge
's
*NL*
resolute
purpose
to
set
Hepzibah
aside
,
and
step
across
the
threshold
*NL*
into
the
parlor
,
whence
issued
that
broken
and
miserable
murmur
of
*NL*
entreaty
.
It
was
not
pity
that
restrained
him
,
for
,
at
the
first
sound
*NL*
of
the
enfeebled
voice
,
a
red
fire
kindled
in
his
eyes
,
and
he
made
a
*NL*
quick
pace
forward
,
with
something
inexpressibly
fierce
and
grim
*NL*
darkening
forth
,
as
it
were
,
out
of
the
whole
man
.
To
know
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
was
to
see
him
at
that
moment
.
After
such
a
revelation
,
let
*NL*
him
smile
with
what
sultriness
he
would
,
he
could
much
sooner
turn
*NL*
grapes
purple
,
or
pumpkins
yellow
,
than
melt
the
iron-branded
*NL*
impression
out
of
the
beholder
's
memory
.
And
it
rendered
his
aspect
*NL*
not
the
less
,
but
more
frightful
,
that
it
seemed
not
to
express
wrath
*NL*
or
hatred
,
but
a
certain
hot
fellness
of
purpose
,
which
annihilated
*NL*
everything
but
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
after
all
,
are
we
not
slandering
an
excellent
and
amiable
man
?
*NL*
Look
at
the
Judge
now
!
He
is
apparently
conscious
of
having
erred
,
in
*NL*
too
energetically
pressing
his
deeds
of
loving-kindness
on
persons
*NL*
unable
to
appreciate
them
.
He
will
await
their
better
mood
,
and
hold
*NL*
himself
as
ready
to
assist
them
then
as
at
this
moment
.
As
he
draws
*NL*
back
from
the
door
,
an
all-comprehensive
benignity
blazes
from
his
*NL*
visage
,
indicating
that
he
gathers
Hepzibah
,
little
Phoebe
,
and
the
*NL*
invisible
Clifford
,
all
three
,
together
with
the
whole
world
besides
,
*NL*
into
his
immense
heart
,
and
gives
them
a
warm
bath
in
its
flood
of
*NL*
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
me
great
wrong
,
dear
Cousin
Hepzibah
!
''
said
he
,
first
kindly
*NL*
offering
her
his
hand
,
and
then
drawing
on
his
glove
preparatory
to
*NL*
departure
.
``
Very
great
wrong
!
But
I
forgive
it
,
and
will
study
to
make
*NL*
you
think
better
of
me
.
Of
course
,
our
poor
Clifford
being
in
so
*NL*
unhappy
a
state
of
mind
,
I
can
not
think
of
urging
an
interview
at
*NL*
present
.
But
I
shall
watch
over
his
welfare
as
if
he
were
my
own
*NL*
beloved
brother
;
nor
do
I
at
all
despair
,
my
dear
cousin
,
of
*NL*
constraining
both
him
and
you
to
acknowledge
your
injustice
.
When
that
*NL*
shall
happen
,
I
desire
no
other
revenge
than
your
acceptance
of
the
*NL*
best
offices
in
my
power
to
do
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
bow
to
Hepzibah
,
and
a
degree
of
paternal
benevolence
in
his
*NL*
parting
nod
to
Phoebe
,
the
Judge
left
the
shop
,
and
went
smiling
along
*NL*
the
street
.
As
is
customary
with
the
rich
,
when
they
aim
at
the
honors
*NL*
of
a
republic
,
he
apologized
,
as
it
were
,
to
the
people
,
for
his
*NL*
wealth
,
prosperity
,
and
elevated
station
,
by
a
free
and
hearty
manner
*NL*
towards
those
who
knew
him
;
putting
off
the
more
of
his
dignity
in
due
*NL*
proportion
with
the
humbleness
of
the
man
whom
he
saluted
,
and
thereby
*NL*
proving
a
haughty
consciousness
of
his
advantages
as
irrefragably
as
if
*NL*
he
had
marched
forth
preceded
by
a
troop
of
lackeys
to
clear
the
way
.
*NL*
On
this
particular
forenoon
,
so
excessive
was
the
warmth
of
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
kindly
aspect
,
that
-LRB-
such
,
at
least
,
was
the
rumor
about
*NL*
town
-RRB-
an
extra
passage
of
the
water-carts
was
found
essential
,
in
order
*NL*
to
lay
the
dust
occasioned
by
so
much
extra
sunshine
!
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
had
he
disappeared
than
Hepzibah
grew
deadly
white
,
and
,
*NL*
staggering
towards
Phoebe
,
let
her
head
fall
on
the
young
girl
's
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Phoebe
!
''
murmured
she
,
``
that
man
has
been
the
horror
of
my
life
!
*NL*
Shall
I
never
,
never
have
the
courage
,
--
will
my
voice
never
cease
from
*NL*
trembling
long
enough
to
let
me
tell
him
what
he
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
so
very
wicked
?
''
asked
Phoebe
.
``
Yet
his
offers
were
surely
*NL*
kind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
speak
of
them
,
--
he
has
a
heart
of
iron
!
''
rejoined
Hepzibah
.
*NL*
``
Go
,
now
,
and
talk
to
Clifford
!
Amuse
and
keep
him
quiet
!
It
would
*NL*
disturb
him
wretchedly
to
see
me
so
agitated
as
I
am
.
There
,
go
,
dear
*NL*
child
,
and
I
will
try
to
look
after
the
shop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebe
went
accordingly
,
but
perplexed
herself
,
meanwhile
,
with
queries
*NL*
as
to
the
purport
of
the
scene
which
she
had
just
witnessed
,
and
also
*NL*
whether
judges
,
clergymen
,
and
other
characters
of
that
eminent
stamp
*NL*
and
respectability
,
could
really
,
in
any
single
instance
,
be
otherwise
*NL*
than
just
and
upright
men
.
A
doubt
of
this
nature
has
a
most
*NL*
disturbing
influence
,
and
,
if
shown
to
be
a
fact
,
comes
with
fearful
*NL*
and
startling
effect
on
minds
of
the
trim
,
orderly
,
and
limit-loving
*NL*
class
,
in
which
we
find
our
little
country-girl
.
Dispositions
more
*NL*
boldly
speculative
may
derive
a
stern
enjoyment
from
the
discovery
,
*NL*
since
there
must
be
evil
in
the
world
,
that
a
high
man
is
as
likely
to
*NL*
grasp
his
share
of
it
as
a
low
one
.
A
wider
scope
of
view
,
and
a
*NL*
deeper
insight
,
may
see
rank
,
dignity
,
and
station
,
all
proved
*NL*
illusory
,
so
far
as
regards
their
claim
to
human
reverence
,
and
yet
not
*NL*
feel
as
if
the
universe
were
thereby
tumbled
headlong
into
chaos
.
But
*NL*
Phoebe
,
in
order
to
keep
the
universe
in
its
old
place
,
was
fain
to
*NL*
smother
,
in
some
degree
,
her
own
intuitions
as
to
Judge
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
character
.
And
as
for
her
cousin
's
testimony
in
disparagement
of
it
,
*NL*
she
concluded
that
Hepzibah
's
judgment
was
embittered
by
one
of
those
*NL*
family
feuds
which
render
hatred
the
more
deadly
by
the
dead
and
*NL*
corrupted
love
that
they
intermingle
with
its
native
poison
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IX
Clifford
and
Phoebe
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
TRULY
was
there
something
high
,
generous
,
and
noble
in
the
native
*NL*
composition
of
our
poor
old
Hepzibah
!
Or
else
,
--
and
it
was
quite
as
*NL*
probably
the
case
,
--
she
had
been
enriched
by
poverty
,
developed
by
*NL*
sorrow
,
elevated
by
the
strong
and
solitary
affection
of
her
life
,
and
*NL*
thus
endowed
with
heroism
,
which
never
could
have
characterized
her
in
*NL*
what
are
called
happier
circumstances
.
Through
dreary
years
Hepzibah
*NL*
had
looked
forward
--
for
the
most
part
despairingly
,
never
with
any
*NL*
confidence
of
hope
,
but
always
with
the
feeling
that
it
was
her
*NL*
brightest
possibility
--
to
the
very
position
in
which
she
now
found
*NL*
herself
.
In
her
own
behalf
,
she
had
asked
nothing
of
Providence
but
*NL*
the
opportunity
of
devoting
herself
to
this
brother
,
whom
she
had
so
*NL*
loved
,
--
so
admired
for
what
he
was
,
or
might
have
been
,
--
and
to
whom
*NL*
she
had
kept
her
faith
,
alone
of
all
the
world
,
wholly
,
unfalteringly
,
*NL*
at
every
instant
,
and
throughout
life
.
And
here
,
in
his
late
decline
,
*NL*
the
lost
one
had
come
back
out
of
his
long
and
strange
misfortune
,
and
*NL*
was
thrown
on
her
sympathy
,
as
it
seemed
,
not
merely
for
the
bread
of
*NL*
his
physical
existence
,
but
for
everything
that
should
keep
him
morally
*NL*
alive
.
She
had
responded
to
the
call
.
She
had
come
forward
,
--
our
*NL*
poor
,
gaunt
Hepzibah
,
in
her
rusty
silks
,
with
her
rigid
joints
,
and
*NL*
the
sad
perversity
of
her
scowl
,
--
ready
to
do
her
utmost
;
and
with
*NL*
affection
enough
,
if
that
were
all
,
to
do
a
hundred
times
as
much
!
*NL*
There
could
be
few
more
tearful
sights
,
--
and
Heaven
forgive
us
if
a
*NL*
smile
insist
on
mingling
with
our
conception
of
it
!
--
few
sights
with
*NL*
truer
pathos
in
them
,
than
Hepzibah
presented
on
that
first
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
patiently
did
she
endeavor
to
wrap
Clifford
up
in
her
great
,
warm
*NL*
love
,
and
make
it
all
the
world
to
him
,
so
that
he
should
retain
no
*NL*
torturing
sense
of
the
coldness
and
dreariness
without
!
Her
little
*NL*
efforts
to
amuse
him
!
How
pitiful
,
yet
magnanimous
,
they
were
!
*NL*
*NL*
Remembering
his
early
love
of
poetry
and
fiction
,
she
unlocked
a
*NL*
bookcase
,
and
took
down
several
books
that
had
been
excellent
reading
*NL*
in
their
day
.
There
was
a
volume
of
Pope
,
with
the
Rape
of
the
Lock
in
*NL*
it
,
and
another
of
the
Tatler
,
and
an
odd
one
of
Dryden
's
Miscellanies
,
*NL*
all
with
tarnished
gilding
on
their
covers
,
and
thoughts
of
tarnished
*NL*
brilliancy
inside
.
They
had
no
success
with
Clifford
.
These
,
and
all
*NL*
such
writers
of
society
,
whose
new
works
glow
like
the
rich
texture
of
*NL*
a
just-woven
carpet
,
must
be
content
to
relinquish
their
charm
,
for
*NL*
every
reader
,
after
an
age
or
two
,
and
could
hardly
be
supposed
to
*NL*
retain
any
portion
of
it
for
a
mind
that
had
utterly
lost
its
estimate
*NL*
of
modes
and
manners
.
Hepzibah
then
took
up
Rasselas
,
and
began
to
*NL*
read
of
the
Happy
Valley
,
with
a
vague
idea
that
some
secret
of
a
*NL*
contented
life
had
there
been
elaborated
,
which
might
at
least
serve
*NL*
Clifford
and
herself
for
this
one
day
.
But
the
Happy
Valley
had
a
*NL*
cloud
over
it
.
Hepzibah
troubled
her
auditor
,
moreover
,
by
innumerable
*NL*
sins
of
emphasis
,
which
he
seemed
to
detect
,
without
any
reference
to
*NL*
the
meaning
;
nor
,
in
fact
,
did
he
appear
to
take
much
note
of
the
sense
*NL*
of
what
she
read
,
but
evidently
felt
the
tedium
of
the
lecture
,
without
*NL*
harvesting
its
profit
.
His
sister
's
voice
,
too
,
naturally
harsh
,
had
,
*NL*
in
the
course
of
her
sorrowful
lifetime
,
contracted
a
kind
of
croak
,
*NL*
which
,
when
it
once
gets
into
the
human
throat
,
is
as
ineradicable
as
*NL*
sin
.
In
both
sexes
,
occasionally
,
this
lifelong
croak
,
accompanying
*NL*
each
word
of
joy
or
sorrow
,
is
one
of
the
symptoms
of
a
settled
*NL*
melancholy
;
and
wherever
it
occurs
,
the
whole
history
of
misfortune
is
*NL*
conveyed
in
its
slightest
accent
.
The
effect
is
as
if
the
voice
had
*NL*
been
dyed
black
;
or
,
--
if
we
must
use
a
more
moderate
simile
,
--
this
*NL*
miserable
croak
,
running
through
all
the
variations
of
the
voice
,
is
*NL*
like
a
black
silken
thread
,
on
which
the
crystal
beads
of
speech
are
*NL*
strung
,
and
whence
they
take
their
hue
.
Such
voices
have
put
on
*NL*
mourning
for
dead
hopes
;
and
they
ought
to
die
and
be
buried
along
with
*NL*
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
Discerning
that
Clifford
was
not
gladdened
by
her
efforts
,
Hepzibah
*NL*
searched
about
the
house
for
the
means
of
more
exhilarating
pastime
.
*NL*
At
one
time
,
her
eyes
chanced
to
rest
on
Alice
Pyncheon
's
harpsichord
.
*NL*
It
was
a
moment
of
great
peril
;
for
,
--
despite
the
traditionary
awe
that
*NL*
had
gathered
over
this
instrument
of
music
,
and
the
dirges
which
*NL*
spiritual
fingers
were
said
to
play
on
it
,
--
the
devoted
sister
had
*NL*
solemn
thoughts
of
thrumming
on
its
chords
for
Clifford
's
benefit
,
and
*NL*
accompanying
the
performance
with
her
voice
.
Poor
Clifford
!
Poor
*NL*
Hepzibah
!
Poor
harpsichord
!
All
three
would
have
been
miserable
*NL*
together
.
By
some
good
agency
,
--
possibly
,
by
the
unrecognized
*NL*
interposition
of
the
long-buried
Alice
herself
,
--
the
threatening
*NL*
calamity
was
averted
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
worst
of
all
--
the
hardest
stroke
of
fate
for
Hepzibah
to
*NL*
endure
,
and
perhaps
for
Clifford
,
too
was
his
invincible
distaste
for
*NL*
her
appearance
.
Her
features
,
never
the
most
agreeable
,
and
now
harsh
*NL*
with
age
and
grief
,
and
resentment
against
the
world
for
his
sake
;
her
*NL*
dress
,
and
especially
her
turban
;
the
queer
and
quaint
manners
,
which
*NL*
had
unconsciously
grown
upon
her
in
solitude
,
--
such
being
the
poor
*NL*
gentlewoman
's
outward
characteristics
,
it
is
no
great
marvel
,
although
*NL*
the
mournfullest
of
pities
,
that
the
instinctive
lover
of
the
Beautiful
*NL*
was
fain
to
turn
away
his
eyes
.
There
was
no
help
for
it
.
It
would
be
*NL*
the
latest
impulse
to
die
within
him
.
In
his
last
extremity
,
the
*NL*
expiring
breath
stealing
faintly
through
Clifford
's
lips
,
he
would
*NL*
doubtless
press
Hepzibah
's
hand
,
in
fervent
recognition
of
all
her
*NL*
lavished
love
,
and
close
his
eyes
,
--
but
not
so
much
to
die
,
as
to
be
*NL*
constrained
to
look
no
longer
on
her
face
!
Poor
Hepzibah
!
She
took
*NL*
counsel
with
herself
what
might
be
done
,
and
thought
of
putting
ribbons
*NL*
on
her
turban
;
but
,
by
the
instant
rush
of
several
guardian
angels
,
was
*NL*
withheld
from
an
experiment
that
could
hardly
have
proved
less
than
*NL*
fatal
to
the
beloved
object
of
her
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
brief
,
besides
Hepzibah
's
disadvantages
of
person
,
there
was
an
*NL*
uncouthness
pervading
all
her
deeds
;
a
clumsy
something
,
that
could
but
*NL*
ill
adapt
itself
for
use
,
and
not
at
all
for
ornament
.
She
was
a
grief
*NL*
to
Clifford
,
and
she
knew
it
.
In
this
extremity
,
the
antiquated
virgin
*NL*
turned
to
Phoebe
.
No
grovelling
jealousy
was
in
her
heart
.
Had
it
*NL*
pleased
Heaven
to
crown
the
heroic
fidelity
of
her
life
by
making
her
*NL*
personally
the
medium
of
Clifford
's
happiness
,
it
would
have
rewarded
*NL*
her
for
all
the
past
,
by
a
joy
with
no
bright
tints
,
indeed
,
but
deep
*NL*
and
true
,
and
worth
a
thousand
gayer
ecstasies
.
This
could
not
be
.
*NL*
She
therefore
turned
to
Phoebe
,
and
resigned
the
task
into
the
young
*NL*
girl
's
hands
.
The
latter
took
it
up
cheerfully
,
as
she
did
everything
,
*NL*
but
with
no
sense
of
a
mission
to
perform
,
and
succeeding
all
the
*NL*
better
for
that
same
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
involuntary
effect
of
a
genial
temperament
,
Phoebe
soon
grew
to
*NL*
be
absolutely
essential
to
the
daily
comfort
,
if
not
the
daily
life
,
of
*NL*
her
two
forlorn
companions
.
The
grime
and
sordidness
of
the
House
of
*NL*
the
Seven
Gables
seemed
to
have
vanished
since
her
appearance
there
;
*NL*
the
gnawing
tooth
of
the
dry-rot
was
stayed
among
the
old
timbers
of
*NL*
its
skeleton
frame
;
the
dust
had
ceased
to
settle
down
so
densely
,
from
*NL*
the
antique
ceilings
,
upon
the
floors
and
furniture
of
the
rooms
*NL*
below
,
--
or
,
at
any
rate
,
there
was
a
little
housewife
,
as
light-footed
*NL*
as
the
breeze
that
sweeps
a
garden
walk
,
gliding
hither
and
thither
to
*NL*
brush
it
all
away
.
The
shadows
of
gloomy
events
that
haunted
the
else
*NL*
lonely
and
desolate
apartments
;
the
heavy
,
breathless
scent
which
death
*NL*
had
left
in
more
than
one
of
the
bedchambers
,
ever
since
his
visits
of
*NL*
long
ago
,
--
these
were
less
powerful
than
the
purifying
influence
*NL*
scattered
throughout
the
atmosphere
of
the
household
by
the
presence
of
*NL*
one
youthful
,
fresh
,
and
thoroughly
wholesome
heart
.
There
was
no
*NL*
morbidness
in
Phoebe
;
if
there
had
been
,
the
old
Pyncheon
House
was
the
*NL*
very
locality
to
ripen
it
into
incurable
disease
.
But
now
her
spirit
*NL*
resembled
,
in
its
potency
,
a
minute
quantity
of
ottar
of
rose
in
one
of
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
huge
,
iron-bound
trunks
,
diffusing
its
fragrance
through
the
*NL*
various
articles
of
linen
and
wrought-lace
,
kerchiefs
,
caps
,
stockings
,
*NL*
folded
dresses
,
gloves
,
and
whatever
else
was
treasured
there
.
As
*NL*
every
article
in
the
great
trunk
was
the
sweeter
for
the
rose-scent
,
so
*NL*
did
all
the
thoughts
and
emotions
of
Hepzibah
and
Clifford
,
sombre
as
*NL*
they
might
seem
,
acquire
a
subtle
attribute
of
happiness
from
Phoebe
's
*NL*
intermixture
with
them
.
Her
activity
of
body
,
intellect
,
and
heart
*NL*
impelled
her
continually
to
perform
the
ordinary
little
toils
that
*NL*
offered
themselves
around
her
,
and
to
think
the
thought
proper
for
the
*NL*
moment
,
and
to
sympathize
,
--
now
with
the
twittering
gayety
of
the
*NL*
robins
in
the
pear-tree
,
and
now
to
such
a
depth
as
she
could
with
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
dark
anxiety
,
or
the
vague
moan
of
her
brother
.
This
facile
*NL*
adaptation
was
at
once
the
symptom
of
perfect
health
and
its
best
*NL*
preservative
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
nature
like
Phoebe
's
has
invariably
its
due
influence
,
but
is
seldom
*NL*
regarded
with
due
honor
.
Its
spiritual
force
,
however
,
may
be
*NL*
partially
estimated
by
the
fact
of
her
having
found
a
place
for
*NL*
herself
,
amid
circumstances
so
stern
as
those
which
surrounded
the
*NL*
mistress
of
the
house
;
and
also
by
the
effect
which
she
produced
on
a
*NL*
character
of
so
much
more
mass
than
her
own
.
For
the
gaunt
,
bony
*NL*
frame
and
limbs
of
Hepzibah
,
as
compared
with
the
tiny
lightsomeness
of
*NL*
Phoebe
's
figure
,
were
perhaps
in
some
fit
proportion
with
the
moral
*NL*
weight
and
substance
,
respectively
,
of
the
woman
and
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
guest
,
--
to
Hepzibah
's
brother
,
--
or
Cousin
Clifford
,
as
Phoebe
*NL*
now
began
to
call
him
,
--
she
was
especially
necessary
.
Not
that
he
could
*NL*
ever
be
said
to
converse
with
her
,
or
often
manifest
,
in
any
other
very
*NL*
definite
mode
,
his
sense
of
a
charm
in
her
society
.
But
if
she
were
a
*NL*
long
while
absent
he
became
pettish
and
nervously
restless
,
pacing
the
*NL*
room
to
and
fro
with
the
uncertainty
that
characterized
all
his
*NL*
movements
;
or
else
would
sit
broodingly
in
his
great
chair
,
resting
his
*NL*
head
on
his
hands
,
and
evincing
life
only
by
an
electric
sparkle
of
*NL*
ill-humor
,
whenever
Hepzibah
endeavored
to
arouse
him
.
Phoebe
's
*NL*
presence
,
and
the
contiguity
of
her
fresh
life
to
his
blighted
one
,
was
*NL*
usually
all
that
he
required
.
Indeed
,
such
was
the
native
gush
and
play
*NL*
of
her
spirit
,
that
she
was
seldom
perfectly
quiet
and
undemonstrative
,
*NL*
any
more
than
a
fountain
ever
ceases
to
dimple
and
warble
with
its
*NL*
flow
.
She
possessed
the
gift
of
song
,
and
that
,
too
,
so
naturally
,
that
*NL*
you
would
as
little
think
of
inquiring
whence
she
had
caught
it
,
or
*NL*
what
master
had
taught
her
,
as
of
asking
the
same
questions
about
a
*NL*
bird
,
in
whose
small
strain
of
music
we
recognize
the
voice
of
the
*NL*
Creator
as
distinctly
as
in
the
loudest
accents
of
his
thunder
.
So
long
*NL*
as
Phoebe
sang
,
she
might
stray
at
her
own
will
about
the
house
.
*NL*
Clifford
was
content
,
whether
the
sweet
,
airy
homeliness
of
her
tones
*NL*
came
down
from
the
upper
chambers
,
or
along
the
passageway
from
the
*NL*
shop
,
or
was
sprinkled
through
the
foliage
of
the
pear-tree
,
inward
*NL*
from
the
garden
,
with
the
twinkling
sunbeams
.
He
would
sit
quietly
,
*NL*
with
a
gentle
pleasure
gleaming
over
his
face
,
brighter
now
,
and
now
a
*NL*
little
dimmer
,
as
the
song
happened
to
float
near
him
,
or
was
more
*NL*
remotely
heard
.
It
pleased
him
best
,
however
,
when
she
sat
on
a
low
*NL*
footstool
at
his
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
perhaps
remarkable
,
considering
her
temperament
,
that
Phoebe
*NL*
oftener
chose
a
strain
of
pathos
than
of
gayety
.
But
the
young
and
*NL*
happy
are
not
ill
pleased
to
temper
their
life
with
a
transparent
*NL*
shadow
.
The
deepest
pathos
of
Phoebe
's
voice
and
song
,
moreover
,
came
*NL*
sifted
through
the
golden
texture
of
a
cheery
spirit
,
and
was
somehow
*NL*
so
interfused
with
the
quality
thence
acquired
,
that
one
's
heart
felt
*NL*
all
the
lighter
for
having
wept
at
it
.
Broad
mirth
,
in
the
sacred
*NL*
presence
of
dark
misfortune
,
would
have
jarred
harshly
and
irreverently
*NL*
with
the
solemn
symphony
that
rolled
its
undertone
through
Hepzibah
's
*NL*
and
her
brother
's
life
.
Therefore
,
it
was
well
that
Phoebe
so
often
*NL*
chose
sad
themes
,
and
not
amiss
that
they
ceased
to
be
so
sad
while
she
*NL*
was
singing
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Becoming
habituated
to
her
companionship
,
Clifford
readily
showed
how
*NL*
capable
of
imbibing
pleasant
tints
and
gleams
of
cheerful
light
from
*NL*
all
quarters
his
nature
must
originally
have
been
.
He
grew
youthful
*NL*
while
she
sat
by
him
.
A
beauty
,
--
not
precisely
real
,
even
in
its
*NL*
utmost
manifestation
,
and
which
a
painter
would
have
watched
long
to
*NL*
seize
and
fix
upon
his
canvas
,
and
,
after
all
,
in
vain
,
--
beauty
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
that
was
not
a
mere
dream
,
would
sometimes
play
upon
and
*NL*
illuminate
his
face
.
It
did
more
than
to
illuminate
;
it
transfigured
*NL*
him
with
an
expression
that
could
only
be
interpreted
as
the
glow
of
an
*NL*
exquisite
and
happy
spirit
.
That
gray
hair
,
and
those
furrows
,
--
with
*NL*
their
record
of
infinite
sorrow
so
deeply
written
across
his
brow
,
and
*NL*
so
compressed
,
as
with
a
futile
effort
to
crowd
in
all
the
tale
,
that
*NL*
the
whole
inscription
was
made
illegible
,
--
these
,
for
the
moment
,
*NL*
vanished
.
An
eye
at
once
tender
and
acute
might
have
beheld
in
the
man
*NL*
some
shadow
of
what
he
was
meant
to
be
.
Anon
,
as
age
came
stealing
,
*NL*
like
a
sad
twilight
,
back
over
his
figure
,
you
would
have
felt
tempted
*NL*
to
hold
an
argument
with
Destiny
,
and
affirm
,
that
either
this
being
*NL*
should
not
have
been
made
mortal
,
or
mortal
existence
should
have
been
*NL*
tempered
to
his
qualities
.
There
seemed
no
necessity
for
his
having
*NL*
drawn
breath
at
all
;
the
world
never
wanted
him
;
but
,
as
he
had
*NL*
breathed
,
it
ought
always
to
have
been
the
balmiest
of
summer
air
.
The
*NL*
same
perplexity
will
invariably
haunt
us
with
regard
to
natures
that
*NL*
tend
to
feed
exclusively
upon
the
Beautiful
,
let
their
earthly
fate
be
*NL*
as
lenient
as
it
may
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebe
,
it
is
probable
,
had
but
a
very
imperfect
comprehension
of
the
*NL*
character
over
which
she
had
thrown
so
beneficent
a
spell
.
Nor
was
it
*NL*
necessary
.
The
fire
upon
the
hearth
can
gladden
a
whole
semicircle
of
*NL*
faces
round
about
it
,
but
need
not
know
the
individuality
of
one
among
*NL*
them
all
.
Indeed
,
there
was
something
too
fine
and
delicate
in
*NL*
Clifford
's
traits
to
be
perfectly
appreciated
by
one
whose
sphere
lay
*NL*
so
much
in
the
Actual
as
Phoebe
's
did
.
For
Clifford
,
however
,
the
*NL*
reality
,
and
simplicity
,
and
thorough
homeliness
of
the
girl
's
nature
*NL*
were
as
powerful
a
charm
as
any
that
she
possessed
.
Beauty
,
it
is
*NL*
true
,
and
beauty
almost
perfect
in
its
own
style
,
was
indispensable
.
*NL*
Had
Phoebe
been
coarse
in
feature
,
shaped
clumsily
,
of
a
harsh
voice
,
*NL*
and
uncouthly
mannered
,
she
might
have
been
rich
with
all
good
gifts
,
*NL*
beneath
this
unfortunate
exterior
,
and
still
,
so
long
as
she
wore
the
*NL*
guise
of
woman
,
she
would
have
shocked
Clifford
,
and
depressed
him
by
*NL*
her
lack
of
beauty
.
But
nothing
more
beautiful
--
nothing
prettier
,
at
*NL*
least
--
was
ever
made
than
Phoebe
.
And
,
therefore
,
to
this
man
,
--
whose
*NL*
whole
poor
and
impalpable
enjoyment
of
existence
heretofore
,
and
until
*NL*
both
his
heart
and
fancy
died
within
him
,
had
been
a
dream
,
--
whose
*NL*
images
of
women
had
more
and
more
lost
their
warmth
and
substance
,
and
*NL*
been
frozen
,
like
the
pictures
of
secluded
artists
,
into
the
chillest
*NL*
ideality
,
--
to
him
,
this
little
figure
of
the
cheeriest
household
life
*NL*
was
just
what
he
required
to
bring
him
back
into
the
breathing
world
.
*NL*
Persons
who
have
wandered
,
or
been
expelled
,
out
of
the
common
track
of
*NL*
things
,
even
were
it
for
a
better
system
,
desire
nothing
so
much
as
to
*NL*
be
led
back
.
They
shiver
in
their
loneliness
,
be
it
on
a
mountain-top
*NL*
or
in
a
dungeon
.
Now
,
Phoebe
's
presence
made
a
home
about
her
,
--
that
*NL*
very
sphere
which
the
outcast
,
the
prisoner
,
the
potentate
,
--
the
wretch
*NL*
beneath
mankind
,
the
wretch
aside
from
it
,
or
the
wretch
above
*NL*
it
,
--
instinctively
pines
after
,
--
a
home
!
She
was
real
!
Holding
her
*NL*
hand
,
you
felt
something
;
a
tender
something
;
a
substance
,
and
a
warm
*NL*
one
:
and
so
long
as
you
should
feel
its
grasp
,
soft
as
it
was
,
you
*NL*
might
be
certain
that
your
place
was
good
in
the
whole
sympathetic
*NL*
chain
of
human
nature
.
The
world
was
no
longer
a
delusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
looking
a
little
further
in
this
direction
,
we
might
suggest
an
*NL*
explanation
of
an
often-suggested
mystery
.
Why
are
poets
so
apt
to
*NL*
choose
their
mates
,
not
for
any
similarity
of
poetic
endowment
,
but
for
*NL*
qualities
which
might
make
the
happiness
of
the
rudest
handicraftsman
*NL*
as
well
as
that
of
the
ideal
craftsman
of
the
spirit
?
Because
,
*NL*
probably
,
at
his
highest
elevation
,
the
poet
needs
no
human
*NL*
intercourse
;
but
he
finds
it
dreary
to
descend
,
and
be
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
very
beautiful
in
the
relation
that
grew
up
between
*NL*
this
pair
,
so
closely
and
constantly
linked
together
,
yet
with
such
a
*NL*
waste
of
gloomy
and
mysterious
years
from
his
birthday
to
hers
.
On
*NL*
Clifford
's
part
it
was
the
feeling
of
a
man
naturally
endowed
with
the
*NL*
liveliest
sensibility
to
feminine
influence
,
but
who
had
never
quaffed
*NL*
the
cup
of
passionate
love
,
and
knew
that
it
was
now
too
late
.
He
knew
*NL*
it
,
with
the
instinctive
delicacy
that
had
survived
his
intellectual
*NL*
decay
.
Thus
,
his
sentiment
for
Phoebe
,
without
being
paternal
,
was
not
*NL*
less
chaste
than
if
she
had
been
his
daughter
.
He
was
a
man
,
it
is
*NL*
true
,
and
recognized
her
as
a
woman
.
She
was
his
only
representative
*NL*
of
womankind
.
He
took
unfailing
note
of
every
charm
that
appertained
*NL*
to
her
sex
,
and
saw
the
ripeness
of
her
lips
,
and
the
virginal
*NL*
development
of
her
bosom
.
All
her
little
womanly
ways
,
budding
out
of
*NL*
her
like
blossoms
on
a
young
fruit-tree
,
had
their
effect
on
him
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
caused
his
very
heart
to
tingle
with
the
keenest
thrills
of
*NL*
pleasure
.
At
such
moments
,
--
for
the
effect
was
seldom
more
than
*NL*
momentary
,
--
the
half-torpid
man
would
be
full
of
harmonious
life
,
just
*NL*
as
a
long-silent
harp
is
full
of
sound
,
when
the
musician
's
fingers
*NL*
sweep
across
it
.
But
,
after
all
,
it
seemed
rather
a
perception
,
or
a
*NL*
sympathy
,
than
a
sentiment
belonging
to
himself
as
an
individual
.
He
*NL*
read
Phoebe
as
he
would
a
sweet
and
simple
story
;
he
listened
to
her
as
*NL*
if
she
were
a
verse
of
household
poetry
,
which
God
,
in
requital
of
his
*NL*
bleak
and
dismal
lot
,
had
permitted
some
angel
,
that
most
pitied
him
,
*NL*
to
warble
through
the
house
.
She
was
not
an
actual
fact
for
him
,
but
*NL*
the
interpretation
of
all
that
he
lacked
on
earth
brought
warmly
home
*NL*
to
his
conception
;
so
that
this
mere
symbol
,
or
life-like
picture
,
had
*NL*
almost
the
comfort
of
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
strive
in
vain
to
put
the
idea
into
words
.
No
adequate
*NL*
expression
of
the
beauty
and
profound
pathos
with
which
it
impresses
us
*NL*
is
attainable
.
This
being
,
made
only
for
happiness
,
and
heretofore
so
*NL*
miserably
failing
to
be
happy
,
--
his
tendencies
so
hideously
thwarted
,
*NL*
that
,
some
unknown
time
ago
,
the
delicate
springs
of
his
character
,
*NL*
never
morally
or
intellectually
strong
,
had
given
way
,
and
he
was
now
*NL*
imbecile
,
--
this
poor
,
forlorn
voyager
from
the
Islands
of
the
Blest
,
in
*NL*
a
frail
bark
,
on
a
tempestuous
sea
,
had
been
flung
,
by
the
last
*NL*
mountain-wave
of
his
shipwreck
,
into
a
quiet
harbor
.
There
,
as
he
lay
*NL*
more
than
half
lifeless
on
the
strand
,
the
fragrance
of
an
earthly
*NL*
rose-bud
had
come
to
his
nostrils
,
and
,
as
odors
will
,
had
summoned
up
*NL*
reminiscences
or
visions
of
all
the
living
and
breathing
beauty
amid
*NL*
which
he
should
have
had
his
home
.
With
his
native
susceptibility
of
*NL*
happy
influences
,
he
inhales
the
slight
,
ethereal
rapture
into
his
*NL*
soul
,
and
expires
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
how
did
Phoebe
regard
Clifford
?
The
girl
's
was
not
one
of
those
*NL*
natures
which
are
most
attracted
by
what
is
strange
and
exceptional
in
*NL*
human
character
.
The
path
which
would
best
have
suited
her
was
the
*NL*
well-worn
track
of
ordinary
life
;
the
companions
in
whom
she
would
most
*NL*
have
delighted
were
such
as
one
encounters
at
every
turn
.
The
mystery
*NL*
which
enveloped
Clifford
,
so
far
as
it
affected
her
at
all
,
was
an
*NL*
annoyance
,
rather
than
the
piquant
charm
which
many
women
might
have
*NL*
found
in
it
.
Still
,
her
native
kindliness
was
brought
strongly
into
*NL*
play
,
not
by
what
was
darkly
picturesque
in
his
situation
,
nor
so
much
,
*NL*
even
,
by
the
finer
graces
of
his
character
,
as
by
the
simple
appeal
of
*NL*
a
heart
so
forlorn
as
his
to
one
so
full
of
genuine
sympathy
as
hers
.
*NL*
She
gave
him
an
affectionate
regard
,
because
he
needed
so
much
love
,
*NL*
and
seemed
to
have
received
so
little
.
With
a
ready
tact
,
the
result
*NL*
of
ever-active
and
wholesome
sensibility
,
she
discerned
what
was
good
*NL*
for
him
,
and
did
it
.
Whatever
was
morbid
in
his
mind
and
experience
*NL*
she
ignored
;
and
thereby
kept
their
intercourse
healthy
,
by
the
*NL*
incautious
,
but
,
as
it
were
,
heaven-directed
freedom
of
her
whole
*NL*
conduct
.
The
sick
in
mind
,
and
,
perhaps
,
in
body
,
are
rendered
more
*NL*
darkly
and
hopelessly
so
by
the
manifold
reflection
of
their
disease
,
*NL*
mirrored
back
from
all
quarters
in
the
deportment
of
those
about
them
;
*NL*
they
are
compelled
to
inhale
the
poison
of
their
own
breath
,
in
*NL*
infinite
repetition
.
But
Phoebe
afforded
her
poor
patient
a
supply
of
*NL*
purer
air
.
She
impregnated
it
,
too
,
not
with
a
wild-flower
scent
,
--
for
*NL*
wildness
was
no
trait
of
hers
,
--
but
with
the
perfume
of
garden-roses
,
*NL*
pinks
,
and
other
blossoms
of
much
sweetness
,
which
nature
and
man
have
*NL*
consented
together
in
making
grow
from
summer
to
summer
,
and
from
*NL*
century
to
century
.
Such
a
flower
was
Phoebe
in
her
relation
with
*NL*
Clifford
,
and
such
the
delight
that
he
inhaled
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
it
must
be
said
,
her
petals
sometimes
drooped
a
little
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
the
heavy
atmosphere
about
her
.
She
grew
more
*NL*
thoughtful
than
heretofore
.
Looking
aside
at
Clifford
's
face
,
and
*NL*
seeing
the
dim
,
unsatisfactory
elegance
and
the
intellect
almost
*NL*
quenched
,
she
would
try
to
inquire
what
had
been
his
life
.
Was
he
*NL*
always
thus
?
Had
this
veil
been
over
him
from
his
birth
?
--
this
veil
,
*NL*
under
which
far
more
of
his
spirit
was
hidden
than
revealed
,
and
*NL*
through
which
he
so
imperfectly
discerned
the
actual
world
,
--
or
was
its
*NL*
gray
texture
woven
of
some
dark
calamity
?
Phoebe
loved
no
riddles
,
and
*NL*
would
have
been
glad
to
escape
the
perplexity
of
this
one
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
there
was
so
far
a
good
result
of
her
meditations
on
*NL*
Clifford
's
character
,
that
,
when
her
involuntary
conjectures
,
together
*NL*
with
the
tendency
of
every
strange
circumstance
to
tell
its
own
story
,
*NL*
had
gradually
taught
her
the
fact
,
it
had
no
terrible
effect
upon
her
.
*NL*
Let
the
world
have
done
him
what
vast
wrong
it
might
,
she
knew
Cousin
*NL*
Clifford
too
well
--
or
fancied
so
--
ever
to
shudder
at
the
touch
of
his
*NL*
thin
,
delicate
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
a
few
days
after
the
appearance
of
this
remarkable
inmate
,
the
*NL*
routine
of
life
had
established
itself
with
a
good
deal
of
uniformity
*NL*
in
the
old
house
of
our
narrative
.
In
the
morning
,
very
shortly
after
*NL*
breakfast
,
it
was
Clifford
's
custom
to
fall
asleep
in
his
chair
;
nor
,
*NL*
unless
accidentally
disturbed
,
would
he
emerge
from
a
dense
cloud
of
*NL*
slumber
or
the
thinner
mists
that
flitted
to
and
fro
,
until
well
*NL*
towards
noonday
.
These
hours
of
drowsihead
were
the
season
of
the
old
*NL*
gentlewoman
's
attendance
on
her
brother
,
while
Phoebe
took
charge
of
*NL*
the
shop
;
an
arrangement
which
the
public
speedily
understood
,
and
*NL*
evinced
their
decided
preference
of
the
younger
shopwoman
by
the
*NL*
multiplicity
of
their
calls
during
her
administration
of
affairs
.
*NL*
Dinner
over
,
Hepzibah
took
her
knitting-work
,
--
a
long
stocking
of
gray
*NL*
yarn
,
for
her
brother
's
winter
wear
,
--
and
with
a
sigh
,
and
a
scowl
of
*NL*
affectionate
farewell
to
Clifford
,
and
a
gesture
enjoining
watchfulness
*NL*
on
Phoebe
,
went
to
take
her
seat
behind
the
counter
.
It
was
now
the
*NL*
young
girl
's
turn
to
be
the
nurse
,
--
the
guardian
,
the
playmate
,
--
or
*NL*
whatever
is
the
fitter
phrase
,
--
of
the
gray-haired
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
X
The
Pyncheon
Garden
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CLIFFORD
,
except
for
Phoebe
's
More
active
instigation
would
ordinarily
*NL*
have
yielded
to
the
torpor
which
had
crept
through
all
his
modes
of
*NL*
being
,
and
which
sluggishly
counselled
him
to
sit
in
his
morning
chair
*NL*
till
eventide
.
But
the
girl
seldom
failed
to
propose
a
removal
to
the
*NL*
garden
,
where
Uncle
Venner
and
the
daguerreotypist
had
made
such
*NL*
repairs
on
the
roof
of
the
ruinous
arbor
,
or
summer-house
,
that
it
was
*NL*
now
a
sufficient
shelter
from
sunshine
and
casual
showers
.
The
*NL*
hop-vine
,
too
,
had
begun
to
grow
luxuriantly
over
the
sides
of
the
*NL*
little
edifice
,
and
made
an
interior
of
verdant
seclusion
,
with
*NL*
innumerable
peeps
and
glimpses
into
the
wider
solitude
of
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
sometimes
,
in
this
green
play-place
of
flickering
light
,
Phoebe
*NL*
read
to
Clifford
.
Her
acquaintance
,
the
artist
,
who
appeared
to
have
a
*NL*
literary
turn
,
had
supplied
her
with
works
of
fiction
,
in
pamphlet
*NL*
form
,
--
and
a
few
volumes
of
poetry
,
in
altogether
a
different
style
and
*NL*
taste
from
those
which
Hepzibah
selected
for
his
amusement
.
Small
*NL*
thanks
were
due
to
the
books
,
however
,
if
the
girl
's
readings
were
in
*NL*
any
degree
more
successful
than
her
elderly
cousin
's
.
Phoebe
's
voice
*NL*
had
always
a
pretty
music
in
it
,
and
could
either
enliven
Clifford
by
*NL*
its
sparkle
and
gayety
of
tone
,
or
soothe
him
by
a
continued
flow
of
*NL*
pebbly
and
brook-like
cadences
.
But
the
fictions
--
in
which
the
*NL*
country-girl
,
unused
to
works
of
that
nature
,
often
became
deeply
*NL*
absorbed
--
interested
her
strange
auditor
very
little
,
or
not
at
all
.
*NL*
Pictures
of
life
,
scenes
of
passion
or
sentiment
,
wit
,
humor
,
and
*NL*
pathos
,
were
all
thrown
away
,
or
worse
than
thrown
away
,
on
Clifford
;
*NL*
either
because
he
lacked
an
experience
by
which
to
test
their
truth
,
or
*NL*
because
his
own
griefs
were
a
touch-stone
of
reality
that
few
feigned
*NL*
emotions
could
withstand
.
When
Phoebe
broke
into
a
peal
of
merry
*NL*
laughter
at
what
she
read
,
he
would
now
and
then
laugh
for
sympathy
,
*NL*
but
oftener
respond
with
a
troubled
,
questioning
look
.
If
a
tear
--
a
*NL*
maiden
's
sunshiny
tear
over
imaginary
woe
--
dropped
upon
some
melancholy
*NL*
page
,
Clifford
either
took
it
as
a
token
of
actual
calamity
,
or
else
*NL*
grew
peevish
,
and
angrily
motioned
her
to
close
the
volume
.
And
wisely
*NL*
too
!
Is
not
the
world
sad
enough
,
in
genuine
earnest
,
without
making
a
*NL*
pastime
of
mock
sorrows
?
*NL*
*NL*
With
poetry
it
was
rather
better
.
He
delighted
in
the
swell
and
*NL*
subsidence
of
the
rhythm
,
and
the
happily
recurring
rhyme
.
Nor
was
*NL*
Clifford
incapable
of
feeling
the
sentiment
of
poetry
,
--
not
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
where
it
was
highest
or
deepest
,
but
where
it
was
most
flitting
and
*NL*
ethereal
.
It
was
impossible
to
foretell
in
what
exquisite
verse
the
*NL*
awakening
spell
might
lurk
;
but
,
on
raising
her
eyes
from
the
page
to
*NL*
Clifford
's
face
,
Phoebe
would
be
made
aware
,
by
the
light
breaking
*NL*
through
it
,
that
a
more
delicate
intelligence
than
her
own
had
caught
a
*NL*
lambent
flame
from
what
she
read
.
One
glow
of
this
kind
,
however
,
was
*NL*
often
the
precursor
of
gloom
for
many
hours
afterward
;
because
,
when
*NL*
the
glow
left
him
,
he
seemed
conscious
of
a
missing
sense
and
power
,
*NL*
and
groped
about
for
them
,
as
if
a
blind
man
should
go
seeking
his
lost
*NL*
eyesight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
pleased
him
more
,
and
was
better
for
his
inward
welfare
,
that
Phoebe
*NL*
should
talk
,
and
make
passing
occurrences
vivid
to
his
mind
by
her
*NL*
accompanying
description
and
remarks
.
The
life
of
the
garden
offered
*NL*
topics
enough
for
such
discourse
as
suited
Clifford
best
.
He
never
*NL*
failed
to
inquire
what
flowers
had
bloomed
since
yesterday
.
His
*NL*
feeling
for
flowers
was
very
exquisite
,
and
seemed
not
so
much
a
taste
*NL*
as
an
emotion
;
he
was
fond
of
sitting
with
one
in
his
hand
,
intently
*NL*
observing
it
,
and
looking
from
its
petals
into
Phoebe
's
face
,
as
if
the
*NL*
garden
flower
were
the
sister
of
the
household
maiden
.
Not
merely
was
*NL*
there
a
delight
in
the
flower
's
perfume
,
or
pleasure
in
its
beautiful
*NL*
form
,
and
the
delicacy
or
brightness
of
its
hue
;
but
Clifford
's
*NL*
enjoyment
was
accompanied
with
a
perception
of
life
,
character
,
and
*NL*
individuality
,
that
made
him
love
these
blossoms
of
the
garden
,
as
if
*NL*
they
were
endowed
with
sentiment
and
intelligence
.
This
affection
and
*NL*
sympathy
for
flowers
is
almost
exclusively
a
woman
's
trait
.
Men
,
if
*NL*
endowed
with
it
by
nature
,
soon
lose
,
forget
,
and
learn
to
despise
it
,
*NL*
in
their
contact
with
coarser
things
than
flowers
.
Clifford
,
too
,
had
*NL*
long
forgotten
it
;
but
found
it
again
now
,
as
he
slowly
revived
from
*NL*
the
chill
torpor
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
wonderful
how
many
pleasant
incidents
continually
came
to
pass
in
*NL*
that
secluded
garden-spot
when
once
Phoebe
had
set
herself
to
look
for
*NL*
them
.
She
had
seen
or
heard
a
bee
there
,
on
the
first
day
of
her
*NL*
acquaintance
with
the
place
.
And
often
,
--
almost
continually
,
*NL*
indeed
,
--
since
then
,
the
bees
kept
coming
thither
,
Heaven
knows
why
,
or
*NL*
by
what
pertinacious
desire
,
for
far-fetched
sweets
,
when
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
there
were
broad
clover-fields
,
and
all
kinds
of
garden
growth
,
much
*NL*
nearer
home
than
this
.
Thither
the
bees
came
,
however
,
and
plunged
*NL*
into
the
squash-blossoms
,
as
if
there
were
no
other
squash-vines
within
*NL*
a
long
day
's
flight
,
or
as
if
the
soil
of
Hepzibah
's
garden
gave
its
*NL*
productions
just
the
very
quality
which
these
laborious
little
wizards
*NL*
wanted
,
in
order
to
impart
the
Hymettus
odor
to
their
whole
hive
of
New
*NL*
England
honey
.
When
Clifford
heard
their
sunny
,
buzzing
murmur
,
in
the
*NL*
heart
of
the
great
yellow
blossoms
,
he
looked
about
him
with
a
joyful
*NL*
sense
of
warmth
,
and
blue
sky
,
and
green
grass
,
and
of
God
's
free
air
*NL*
in
the
whole
height
from
earth
to
heaven
.
After
all
,
there
need
be
no
*NL*
question
why
the
bees
came
to
that
one
green
nook
in
the
dusty
town
.
*NL*
God
sent
them
thither
to
gladden
our
poor
Clifford
.
They
brought
the
*NL*
rich
summer
with
them
,
in
requital
of
a
little
honey
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
bean-vines
began
to
flower
on
the
poles
,
there
was
one
*NL*
particular
variety
which
bore
a
vivid
scarlet
blossom
.
The
*NL*
daguerreotypist
had
found
these
beans
in
a
garret
,
over
one
of
the
*NL*
seven
gables
,
treasured
up
in
an
old
chest
of
drawers
by
some
*NL*
horticultural
Pyncheon
of
days
gone
by
,
who
doubtless
meant
to
sow
them
*NL*
the
next
summer
,
but
was
himself
first
sown
in
Death
's
garden-ground
.
*NL*
By
way
of
testing
whether
there
were
still
a
living
germ
in
such
*NL*
ancient
seeds
,
Holgrave
had
planted
some
of
them
;
and
the
result
of
his
*NL*
experiment
was
a
splendid
row
of
bean-vines
,
clambering
,
early
,
to
the
*NL*
full
height
of
the
poles
,
and
arraying
them
,
from
top
to
bottom
,
in
a
*NL*
spiral
profusion
of
red
blossoms
.
And
,
ever
since
the
unfolding
of
the
*NL*
first
bud
,
a
multitude
of
humming-birds
had
been
attracted
thither
.
At
*NL*
times
,
it
seemed
as
if
for
every
one
of
the
hundred
blossoms
there
was
*NL*
one
of
these
tiniest
fowls
of
the
air
,
--
a
thumb
's
bigness
of
burnished
*NL*
plumage
,
hovering
and
vibrating
about
the
bean-poles
.
It
was
with
*NL*
indescribable
interest
,
and
even
more
than
childish
delight
,
that
*NL*
Clifford
watched
the
humming-birds
.
He
used
to
thrust
his
head
softly
*NL*
out
of
the
arbor
to
see
them
the
better
;
all
the
while
,
too
,
motioning
*NL*
Phoebe
to
be
quiet
,
and
snatching
glimpses
of
the
smile
upon
her
face
,
*NL*
so
as
to
heap
his
enjoyment
up
the
higher
with
her
sympathy
.
He
had
*NL*
not
merely
grown
young
;
--
he
was
a
child
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
,
whenever
she
happened
to
witness
one
of
these
fits
of
*NL*
miniature
enthusiasm
,
would
shake
her
head
,
with
a
strange
mingling
of
*NL*
the
mother
and
sister
,
and
of
pleasure
and
sadness
,
in
her
aspect
.
She
*NL*
said
that
it
had
always
been
thus
with
Clifford
when
the
humming-birds
*NL*
came
,
--
always
,
from
his
babyhood
,
--
and
that
his
delight
in
them
had
*NL*
been
one
of
the
earliest
tokens
by
which
he
showed
his
love
for
*NL*
beautiful
things
.
And
it
was
a
wonderful
coincidence
,
the
good
lady
*NL*
thought
,
that
the
artist
should
have
planted
these
scarlet-flowering
*NL*
beans
--
which
the
humming-birds
sought
far
and
wide
,
and
which
had
not
*NL*
grown
in
the
Pyncheon
garden
before
for
forty
years
--
on
the
very
summer
*NL*
of
Clifford
's
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
would
the
tears
stand
in
poor
Hepzibah
's
eyes
,
or
overflow
them
*NL*
with
a
too
abundant
gush
,
so
that
she
was
fain
to
betake
herself
into
*NL*
some
corner
,
lest
Clifford
should
espy
her
agitation
.
Indeed
,
all
the
*NL*
enjoyments
of
this
period
were
provocative
of
tears
.
Coming
so
late
as
*NL*
it
did
,
it
was
a
kind
of
Indian
summer
,
with
a
mist
in
its
balmiest
*NL*
sunshine
,
and
decay
and
death
in
its
gaudiest
delight
.
The
more
*NL*
Clifford
seemed
to
taste
the
happiness
of
a
child
,
the
sadder
was
the
*NL*
difference
to
be
recognized
.
With
a
mysterious
and
terrible
Past
,
*NL*
which
had
annihilated
his
memory
,
and
a
blank
Future
before
him
,
he
had
*NL*
only
this
visionary
and
impalpable
Now
,
which
,
if
you
once
look
closely
*NL*
at
it
,
is
nothing
.
He
himself
,
as
was
perceptible
by
many
symptoms
,
*NL*
lay
darkly
behind
his
pleasure
,
and
knew
it
to
be
a
baby-play
,
which
he
*NL*
was
to
toy
and
trifle
with
,
instead
of
thoroughly
believing
.
Clifford
*NL*
saw
,
it
may
be
,
in
the
mirror
of
his
deeper
consciousness
,
that
he
was
*NL*
an
example
and
representative
of
that
great
class
of
people
whom
an
*NL*
inexplicable
Providence
is
continually
putting
at
cross-purposes
with
*NL*
the
world
:
breaking
what
seems
its
own
promise
in
their
nature
;
*NL*
withholding
their
proper
food
,
and
setting
poison
before
them
for
a
*NL*
banquet
;
and
thus
--
when
it
might
so
easily
,
as
one
would
think
,
have
*NL*
been
adjusted
otherwise
--
making
their
existence
a
strangeness
,
a
*NL*
solitude
,
and
torment
.
All
his
life
long
,
he
had
been
learning
how
to
*NL*
be
wretched
,
as
one
learns
a
foreign
tongue
;
and
now
,
with
the
lesson
*NL*
thoroughly
by
heart
,
he
could
with
difficulty
comprehend
his
little
*NL*
airy
happiness
.
Frequently
there
was
a
dim
shadow
of
doubt
in
his
*NL*
eyes
.
``
Take
my
hand
,
Phoebe
,
''
he
would
say
,
``
and
pinch
it
hard
with
*NL*
your
little
fingers
!
Give
me
a
rose
,
that
I
may
press
its
thorns
,
and
*NL*
prove
myself
awake
by
the
sharp
touch
of
pain
!
''
Evidently
,
he
desired
*NL*
this
prick
of
a
trifling
anguish
,
in
order
to
assure
himself
,
by
that
*NL*
quality
which
he
best
knew
to
be
real
,
that
the
garden
,
and
the
seven
*NL*
weather-beaten
gables
,
and
Hepzibah
's
scowl
,
and
Phoebe
's
smile
,
were
*NL*
real
likewise
.
Without
this
signet
in
his
flesh
,
he
could
have
*NL*
attributed
no
more
substance
to
them
than
to
the
empty
confusion
of
*NL*
imaginary
scenes
with
which
he
had
fed
his
spirit
,
until
even
that
poor
*NL*
sustenance
was
exhausted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
author
needs
great
faith
in
his
reader
's
sympathy
;
else
he
must
*NL*
hesitate
to
give
details
so
minute
,
and
incidents
apparently
so
*NL*
trifling
,
as
are
essential
to
make
up
the
idea
of
this
garden-life
.
It
*NL*
was
the
Eden
of
a
thunder-smitten
Adam
,
who
had
fled
for
refuge
thither
*NL*
out
of
the
same
dreary
and
perilous
wilderness
into
which
the
original
*NL*
Adam
was
expelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
available
means
of
amusement
,
of
which
Phoebe
made
the
most
*NL*
in
Clifford
's
behalf
,
was
that
feathered
society
,
the
hens
,
a
breed
of
*NL*
whom
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
was
an
immemorial
heirloom
in
the
*NL*
Pyncheon
family
.
In
compliance
with
a
whim
of
Clifford
,
as
it
troubled
*NL*
him
to
see
them
in
confinement
,
they
had
been
set
at
liberty
,
and
now
*NL*
roamed
at
will
about
the
garden
;
doing
some
little
mischief
,
but
*NL*
hindered
from
escape
by
buildings
on
three
sides
,
and
the
difficult
*NL*
peaks
of
a
wooden
fence
on
the
other
.
They
spent
much
of
their
*NL*
abundant
leisure
on
the
margin
of
Maule
's
well
,
which
was
haunted
by
a
*NL*
kind
of
snail
,
evidently
a
titbit
to
their
palates
;
and
the
brackish
*NL*
water
itself
,
however
nauseous
to
the
rest
of
the
world
,
was
so
greatly
*NL*
esteemed
by
these
fowls
,
that
they
might
be
seen
tasting
,
turning
up
*NL*
their
heads
,
and
smacking
their
bills
,
with
precisely
the
air
of
*NL*
wine-bibbers
round
a
probationary
cask
.
Their
generally
quiet
,
yet
*NL*
often
brisk
,
and
constantly
diversified
talk
,
one
to
another
,
or
*NL*
sometimes
in
soliloquy
,
--
as
they
scratched
worms
out
of
the
rich
,
black
*NL*
soil
,
or
pecked
at
such
plants
as
suited
their
taste
,
--
had
such
a
*NL*
domestic
tone
,
that
it
was
almost
a
wonder
why
you
could
not
establish
*NL*
a
regular
interchange
of
ideas
about
household
matters
,
human
and
*NL*
gallinaceous
.
All
hens
are
well
worth
studying
for
the
piquancy
and
*NL*
rich
variety
of
their
manners
;
but
by
no
possibility
can
there
have
*NL*
been
other
fowls
of
such
odd
appearance
and
deportment
as
these
*NL*
ancestral
ones
.
They
probably
embodied
the
traditionary
peculiarities
*NL*
of
their
whole
line
of
progenitors
,
derived
through
an
unbroken
*NL*
succession
of
eggs
;
or
else
this
individual
Chanticleer
and
his
two
*NL*
wives
had
grown
to
be
humorists
,
and
a
little
crack-brained
withal
,
on
*NL*
account
of
their
solitary
way
of
life
,
and
out
of
sympathy
for
*NL*
Hepzibah
,
their
lady-patroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Queer
,
indeed
,
they
looked
!
Chanticleer
himself
,
though
stalking
on
two
*NL*
stilt-like
legs
,
with
the
dignity
of
interminable
descent
in
all
his
*NL*
gestures
,
was
hardly
bigger
than
an
ordinary
partridge
;
his
two
wives
*NL*
were
about
the
size
of
quails
;
and
as
for
the
one
chicken
,
it
looked
*NL*
small
enough
to
be
still
in
the
egg
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
sufficiently
old
,
withered
,
wizened
,
and
experienced
,
to
have
been
*NL*
founder
of
the
antiquated
race
.
Instead
of
being
the
youngest
of
the
*NL*
family
,
it
rather
seemed
to
have
aggregated
into
itself
the
ages
,
not
*NL*
only
of
these
living
specimens
of
the
breed
,
but
of
all
its
forefathers
*NL*
and
foremothers
,
whose
united
excellences
and
oddities
were
squeezed
*NL*
into
its
little
body
.
Its
mother
evidently
regarded
it
as
the
one
*NL*
chicken
of
the
world
,
and
as
necessary
,
in
fact
,
to
the
world
's
*NL*
continuance
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
to
the
equilibrium
of
the
present
system
*NL*
of
affairs
,
whether
in
church
or
state
.
No
lesser
sense
of
the
infant
*NL*
fowl
's
importance
could
have
justified
,
even
in
a
mother
's
eyes
,
the
*NL*
perseverance
with
which
she
watched
over
its
safety
,
ruffling
her
small
*NL*
person
to
twice
its
proper
size
,
and
flying
in
everybody
's
face
that
so
*NL*
much
as
looked
towards
her
hopeful
progeny
.
No
lower
estimate
could
*NL*
have
vindicated
the
indefatigable
zeal
with
which
she
scratched
,
and
*NL*
her
unscrupulousness
in
digging
up
the
choicest
flower
or
vegetable
,
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
the
fat
earthworm
at
its
root
.
Her
nervous
cluck
,
when
*NL*
the
chicken
happened
to
be
hidden
in
the
long
grass
or
under
the
*NL*
squash-leaves
;
her
gentle
croak
of
satisfaction
,
while
sure
of
it
*NL*
beneath
her
wing
;
her
note
of
ill-concealed
fear
and
obstreperous
*NL*
defiance
,
when
she
saw
her
arch-enemy
,
a
neighbor
's
cat
,
on
the
top
of
*NL*
the
high
fence
,
--
one
or
other
of
these
sounds
was
to
be
heard
at
almost
*NL*
every
moment
of
the
day
.
By
degrees
,
the
observer
came
to
feel
nearly
*NL*
as
much
interest
in
this
chicken
of
illustrious
race
as
the
mother-hen
*NL*
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebe
,
after
getting
well
acquainted
with
the
old
hen
,
was
sometimes
*NL*
permitted
to
take
the
chicken
in
her
hand
,
which
was
quite
capable
of
*NL*
grasping
its
cubic
inch
or
two
of
body
.
While
she
curiously
examined
*NL*
its
hereditary
marks
,
--
the
peculiar
speckle
of
its
plumage
,
the
funny
*NL*
tuft
on
its
head
,
and
a
knob
on
each
of
its
legs
,
--
the
little
biped
,
as
*NL*
she
insisted
,
kept
giving
her
a
sagacious
wink
.
The
daguerreotypist
*NL*
once
whispered
her
that
these
marks
betokened
the
oddities
of
the
*NL*
Pyncheon
family
,
and
that
the
chicken
itself
was
a
symbol
of
the
life
*NL*
of
the
old
house
,
embodying
its
interpretation
,
likewise
,
although
an
*NL*
unintelligible
one
,
as
such
clews
generally
are
.
It
was
a
feathered
*NL*
riddle
;
a
mystery
hatched
out
of
an
egg
,
and
just
as
mysterious
as
if
*NL*
the
egg
had
been
addle
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
of
Chanticleer
's
two
wives
,
ever
since
Phoebe
's
arrival
,
had
*NL*
been
in
a
state
of
heavy
despondency
,
caused
,
as
it
afterwards
*NL*
appeared
,
by
her
inability
to
lay
an
egg
.
One
day
,
however
,
by
her
*NL*
self-important
gait
,
the
sideways
turn
of
her
head
,
and
the
cock
of
her
*NL*
eye
,
as
she
pried
into
one
and
another
nook
of
the
garden
,
--
croaking
to
*NL*
herself
,
all
the
while
,
with
inexpressible
complacency
,
--
it
was
made
*NL*
evident
that
this
identical
hen
,
much
as
mankind
undervalued
her
,
*NL*
carried
something
about
her
person
the
worth
of
which
was
not
to
be
*NL*
estimated
either
in
gold
or
precious
stones
.
Shortly
after
,
there
was
*NL*
a
prodigious
cackling
and
gratulation
of
Chanticleer
and
all
his
*NL*
family
,
including
the
wizened
chicken
,
who
appeared
to
understand
the
*NL*
matter
quite
as
well
as
did
his
sire
,
his
mother
,
or
his
aunt
.
That
*NL*
afternoon
Phoebe
found
a
diminutive
egg
,
--
not
in
the
regular
nest
,
it
*NL*
was
far
too
precious
to
be
trusted
there
,
--
but
cunningly
hidden
under
*NL*
the
currant-bushes
,
on
some
dry
stalks
of
last
year
's
grass
.
Hepzibah
,
*NL*
on
learning
the
fact
,
took
possession
of
the
egg
and
appropriated
it
to
*NL*
Clifford
's
breakfast
,
on
account
of
a
certain
delicacy
of
flavor
,
for
*NL*
which
,
as
she
affirmed
,
these
eggs
had
always
been
famous
.
Thus
*NL*
unscrupulously
did
the
old
gentlewoman
sacrifice
the
continuance
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
of
an
ancient
feathered
race
,
with
no
better
end
than
to
*NL*
supply
her
brother
with
a
dainty
that
hardly
filled
the
bowl
of
a
*NL*
tea-spoon
!
It
must
have
been
in
reference
to
this
outrage
that
*NL*
Chanticleer
,
the
next
day
,
accompanied
by
the
bereaved
mother
of
the
*NL*
egg
,
took
his
post
in
front
of
Phoebe
and
Clifford
,
and
delivered
*NL*
himself
of
a
harangue
that
might
have
proved
as
long
as
his
own
*NL*
pedigree
,
but
for
a
fit
of
merriment
on
Phoebe
's
part
.
Hereupon
,
the
*NL*
offended
fowl
stalked
away
on
his
long
stilts
,
and
utterly
withdrew
his
*NL*
notice
from
Phoebe
and
the
rest
of
human
nature
,
until
she
made
her
*NL*
peace
with
an
offering
of
spice-cake
,
which
,
next
to
snails
,
was
the
*NL*
delicacy
most
in
favor
with
his
aristocratic
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
linger
too
long
,
no
doubt
,
beside
this
paltry
rivulet
of
life
that
*NL*
flowed
through
the
garden
of
the
Pyncheon
House
.
But
we
deem
it
*NL*
pardonable
to
record
these
mean
incidents
and
poor
delights
,
because
*NL*
they
proved
so
greatly
to
Clifford
's
benefit
.
They
had
the
earth-smell
*NL*
in
them
,
and
contributed
to
give
him
health
and
substance
.
Some
of
his
*NL*
occupations
wrought
less
desirably
upon
him
.
He
had
a
singular
*NL*
propensity
,
for
example
,
to
hang
over
Maule
's
well
,
and
look
at
the
*NL*
constantly
shifting
phantasmagoria
of
figures
produced
by
the
agitation
*NL*
of
the
water
over
the
mosaic-work
of
colored
pebbles
at
the
bottom
.
He
*NL*
said
that
faces
looked
upward
to
him
there
,
--
beautiful
faces
,
arrayed
*NL*
in
bewitching
smiles
,
--
each
momentary
face
so
fair
and
rosy
,
and
every
*NL*
smile
so
sunny
,
that
he
felt
wronged
at
its
departure
,
until
the
same
*NL*
flitting
witchcraft
made
a
new
one
.
But
sometimes
he
would
suddenly
*NL*
cry
out
,
``
The
dark
face
gazes
at
me
!
''
and
be
miserable
the
whole
day
*NL*
afterwards
.
Phoebe
,
when
she
hung
over
the
fountain
by
Clifford
's
*NL*
side
,
could
see
nothing
of
all
this
,
--
neither
the
beauty
nor
the
*NL*
ugliness
,
--
but
only
the
colored
pebbles
,
looking
as
if
the
gush
of
the
*NL*
waters
shook
and
disarranged
them
.
And
the
dark
face
,
that
so
troubled
*NL*
Clifford
,
was
no
more
than
the
shadow
thrown
from
a
branch
of
one
of
*NL*
the
damson-trees
,
and
breaking
the
inner
light
of
Maule
's
well
.
The
*NL*
truth
was
,
however
,
that
his
fancy
--
reviving
faster
than
his
will
and
*NL*
judgment
,
and
always
stronger
than
they
--
created
shapes
of
loveliness
*NL*
that
were
symbolic
of
his
native
character
,
and
now
and
then
a
stern
*NL*
and
dreadful
shape
that
typified
his
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sundays
,
after
Phoebe
had
been
at
church
,
--
for
the
girl
had
a
*NL*
church-going
conscience
,
and
would
hardly
have
been
at
ease
had
she
*NL*
missed
either
prayer
,
singing
,
sermon
,
or
benediction
,
--
after
*NL*
church-time
,
therefore
,
there
was
,
ordinarily
,
a
sober
little
festival
*NL*
in
the
garden
.
In
addition
to
Clifford
,
Hepzibah
,
and
Phoebe
,
two
*NL*
guests
made
up
the
company
.
One
was
the
artist
Holgrave
,
who
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
his
consociation
with
reformers
,
and
his
other
queer
and
*NL*
questionable
traits
,
continued
to
hold
an
elevated
place
in
Hepzibah
's
*NL*
regard
.
The
other
,
we
are
almost
ashamed
to
say
,
was
the
venerable
*NL*
Uncle
Venner
,
in
a
clean
shirt
,
and
a
broadcloth
coat
,
more
respectable
*NL*
than
his
ordinary
wear
,
inasmuch
as
it
was
neatly
patched
on
each
*NL*
elbow
,
and
might
be
called
an
entire
garment
,
except
for
a
slight
*NL*
inequality
in
the
length
of
its
skirts
.
Clifford
,
on
several
*NL*
occasions
,
had
seemed
to
enjoy
the
old
man
's
intercourse
,
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
his
mellow
,
cheerful
vein
,
which
was
like
the
sweet
flavor
of
a
*NL*
frost-bitten
apple
,
such
as
one
picks
up
under
the
tree
in
December
.
A
*NL*
man
at
the
very
lowest
point
of
the
social
scale
was
easier
and
more
*NL*
agreeable
for
the
fallen
gentleman
to
encounter
than
a
person
at
any
of
*NL*
the
intermediate
degrees
;
and
,
moreover
,
as
Clifford
's
young
manhood
*NL*
had
been
lost
,
he
was
fond
of
feeling
himself
comparatively
youthful
,
*NL*
now
,
in
apposition
with
the
patriarchal
age
of
Uncle
Venner
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
it
was
sometimes
observable
that
Clifford
half
wilfully
hid
from
*NL*
himself
the
consciousness
of
being
stricken
in
years
,
and
cherished
*NL*
visions
of
an
earthly
future
still
before
him
;
visions
,
however
,
too
*NL*
indistinctly
drawn
to
be
followed
by
disappointment
--
though
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
by
depression
--
when
any
casual
incident
or
recollection
made
him
*NL*
sensible
of
the
withered
leaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
this
oddly
composed
little
social
party
used
to
assemble
under
the
*NL*
ruinous
arbor
.
Hepzibah
--
stately
as
ever
at
heart
,
and
yielding
not
an
*NL*
inch
of
her
old
gentility
,
but
resting
upon
it
so
much
the
more
,
as
*NL*
justifying
a
princess-like
condescension
--
exhibited
a
not
ungraceful
*NL*
hospitality
.
She
talked
kindly
to
the
vagrant
artist
,
and
took
sage
*NL*
counsel
--
lady
as
she
was
--
with
the
wood-sawyer
,
the
messenger
of
*NL*
everybody
's
petty
errands
,
the
patched
philosopher
.
And
Uncle
Venner
,
*NL*
who
had
studied
the
world
at
street-corners
,
and
other
posts
equally
*NL*
well
adapted
for
just
observation
,
was
as
ready
to
give
out
his
wisdom
*NL*
as
a
town-pump
to
give
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Hepzibah
,
ma'am
,
''
said
he
once
,
after
they
had
all
been
cheerful
*NL*
together
,
``
I
really
enjoy
these
quiet
little
meetings
of
a
Sabbath
*NL*
afternoon
.
They
are
very
much
like
what
I
expect
to
have
after
I
*NL*
retire
to
my
farm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
Venner
''
observed
Clifford
in
a
drowsy
,
inward
tone
,
``
is
always
*NL*
talking
about
his
farm
.
But
I
have
a
better
scheme
for
him
,
by
and
by
.
*NL*
We
shall
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Mr.
Clifford
Pyncheon
!
''
said
the
man
of
patches
,
``
you
may
scheme
*NL*
for
me
as
much
as
you
please
;
but
I
'm
not
going
to
give
up
this
one
*NL*
scheme
of
my
own
,
even
if
I
never
bring
it
really
to
pass
.
It
does
*NL*
seem
to
me
that
men
make
a
wonderful
mistake
in
trying
to
heap
up
*NL*
property
upon
property
.
If
I
had
done
so
,
I
should
feel
as
if
*NL*
Providence
was
not
bound
to
take
care
of
me
;
and
,
at
all
events
,
the
*NL*
city
would
n't
be
!
I
'm
one
of
those
people
who
think
that
infinity
is
*NL*
big
enough
for
us
all
--
and
eternity
long
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
so
they
are
,
Uncle
Venner
,
''
remarked
Phoebe
after
a
pause
;
for
*NL*
she
had
been
trying
to
fathom
the
profundity
and
appositeness
of
this
*NL*
concluding
apothegm
.
``
But
for
this
short
life
of
ours
,
one
would
like
*NL*
a
house
and
a
moderate
garden-spot
of
one
's
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
to
me
,
''
said
the
daguerreotypist
,
smiling
,
``
that
Uncle
*NL*
Venner
has
the
principles
of
Fourier
at
the
bottom
of
his
wisdom
;
only
*NL*
they
have
not
quite
so
much
distinctness
in
his
mind
as
in
that
of
the
*NL*
systematizing
Frenchman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Phoebe
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
``
it
is
time
to
bring
the
currants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
while
the
yellow
richness
of
the
declining
sunshine
still
*NL*
fell
into
the
open
space
of
the
garden
,
Phoebe
brought
out
a
loaf
of
*NL*
bread
and
a
china
bowl
of
currants
,
freshly
gathered
from
the
bushes
,
*NL*
and
crushed
with
sugar
.
These
,
with
water
,
--
but
not
from
the
fountain
*NL*
of
ill
omen
,
close
at
hand
,
--
constituted
all
the
entertainment
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Holgrave
took
some
pains
to
establish
an
intercourse
with
*NL*
Clifford
,
actuated
,
it
might
seem
,
entirely
by
an
impulse
of
*NL*
kindliness
,
in
order
that
the
present
hour
might
be
cheerfuller
than
*NL*
most
which
the
poor
recluse
had
spent
,
or
was
destined
yet
to
spend
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
in
the
artist
's
deep
,
thoughtful
,
all-observant
eyes
,
*NL*
there
was
,
now
and
then
,
an
expression
,
not
sinister
,
but
questionable
;
*NL*
as
if
he
had
some
other
interest
in
the
scene
than
a
stranger
,
a
*NL*
youthful
and
unconnected
adventurer
,
might
be
supposed
to
have
.
With
*NL*
great
mobility
of
outward
mood
,
however
,
he
applied
himself
to
the
task
*NL*
of
enlivening
the
party
;
and
with
so
much
success
,
that
even
dark-hued
*NL*
Hepzibah
threw
off
one
tint
of
melancholy
,
and
made
what
shift
she
*NL*
could
with
the
remaining
portion
.
Phoebe
said
to
herself
,
--
``
How
*NL*
pleasant
he
can
be
!
''
As
for
Uncle
Venner
,
as
a
mark
of
friendship
and
*NL*
approbation
,
he
readily
consented
to
afford
the
young
man
his
*NL*
countenance
in
the
way
of
his
profession
,
--
not
metaphorically
,
be
it
*NL*
understood
,
but
literally
,
by
allowing
a
daguerreotype
of
his
face
,
so
*NL*
familiar
to
the
town
,
to
be
exhibited
at
the
entrance
of
Holgrave
's
*NL*
studio
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clifford
,
as
the
company
partook
of
their
little
banquet
,
grew
to
be
*NL*
the
gayest
of
them
all
.
Either
it
was
one
of
those
up-quivering
*NL*
flashes
of
the
spirit
,
to
which
minds
in
an
abnormal
state
are
liable
,
*NL*
or
else
the
artist
had
subtly
touched
some
chord
that
made
musical
*NL*
vibration
.
Indeed
,
what
with
the
pleasant
summer
evening
,
and
the
*NL*
sympathy
of
this
little
circle
of
not
unkindly
souls
,
it
was
perhaps
*NL*
natural
that
a
character
so
susceptible
as
Clifford
's
should
become
*NL*
animated
,
and
show
itself
readily
responsive
to
what
was
said
around
*NL*
him
.
But
he
gave
out
his
own
thoughts
,
likewise
,
with
an
airy
and
*NL*
fanciful
glow
;
so
that
they
glistened
,
as
it
were
,
through
the
arbor
,
*NL*
and
made
their
escape
among
the
interstices
of
the
foliage
.
He
had
*NL*
been
as
cheerful
,
no
doubt
,
while
alone
with
Phoebe
,
but
never
with
*NL*
such
tokens
of
acute
,
although
partial
intelligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
the
sunlight
left
the
peaks
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
so
did
the
*NL*
excitement
fade
out
of
Clifford
's
eyes
.
He
gazed
vaguely
and
*NL*
mournfully
about
him
,
as
if
he
missed
something
precious
,
and
missed
it
*NL*
the
more
drearily
for
not
knowing
precisely
what
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
my
happiness
!
''
at
last
he
murmured
hoarsely
and
indistinctly
,
*NL*
hardly
shaping
out
the
words
.
``
Many
,
many
years
have
I
waited
for
it
!
*NL*
It
is
late
!
It
is
late
!
I
want
my
happiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
,
poor
Clifford
!
You
are
old
,
and
worn
with
troubles
that
ought
*NL*
never
to
have
befallen
you
.
You
are
partly
crazy
and
partly
imbecile
;
*NL*
a
ruin
,
a
failure
,
as
almost
everybody
is
,
--
though
some
in
less
degree
,
*NL*
or
less
perceptibly
,
than
their
fellows
.
Fate
has
no
happiness
in
*NL*
store
for
you
;
unless
your
quiet
home
in
the
old
family
residence
with
*NL*
the
faithful
Hepzibah
,
and
your
long
summer
afternoons
with
Phoebe
,
and
*NL*
these
Sabbath
festivals
with
Uncle
Venner
and
the
daguerreotypist
,
*NL*
deserve
to
be
called
happiness
!
Why
not
?
If
not
the
thing
itself
,
it
*NL*
is
marvellously
like
it
,
and
the
more
so
for
that
ethereal
and
*NL*
intangible
quality
which
causes
it
all
to
vanish
at
too
close
an
*NL*
introspection
.
Take
it
,
therefore
,
while
you
may
.
Murmur
*NL*
not
,
--
question
not
,
--
but
make
the
most
of
it
!

XI
The
Arched
Window
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
FROM
the
inertness
,
or
what
we
may
term
the
vegetative
character
,
of
*NL*
his
ordinary
mood
,
Clifford
would
perhaps
have
been
content
to
spend
*NL*
one
day
after
another
,
interminably
,
--
or
,
at
least
,
throughout
the
*NL*
summer-time
,
--
in
just
the
kind
of
life
described
in
the
preceding
*NL*
pages
.
Fancying
,
however
,
that
it
might
be
for
his
benefit
*NL*
occasionally
to
diversify
the
scene
,
Phoebe
sometimes
suggested
that
he
*NL*
should
look
out
upon
the
life
of
the
street
.
For
this
purpose
,
they
*NL*
used
to
mount
the
staircase
together
,
to
the
second
story
of
the
house
,
*NL*
where
,
at
the
termination
of
a
wide
entry
,
there
was
an
arched
window
,
*NL*
of
uncommonly
large
dimensions
,
shaded
by
a
pair
of
curtains
.
It
*NL*
opened
above
the
porch
,
where
there
had
formerly
been
a
balcony
,
the
*NL*
balustrade
of
which
had
long
since
gone
to
decay
,
and
been
removed
.
At
*NL*
this
arched
window
,
throwing
it
open
,
but
keeping
himself
in
*NL*
comparative
obscurity
by
means
of
the
curtain
,
Clifford
had
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
witnessing
such
a
portion
of
the
great
world
's
movement
*NL*
as
might
be
supposed
to
roll
through
one
of
the
retired
streets
of
a
*NL*
not
very
populous
city
.
But
he
and
Phoebe
made
a
sight
as
well
worth
*NL*
seeing
as
any
that
the
city
could
exhibit
.
The
pale
,
gray
,
childish
,
*NL*
aged
,
melancholy
,
yet
often
simply
cheerful
,
and
sometimes
delicately
*NL*
intelligent
aspect
of
Clifford
,
peering
from
behind
the
faded
crimson
*NL*
of
the
curtain
,
--
watching
the
monotony
of
every-day
occurrences
with
a
*NL*
kind
of
inconsequential
interest
and
earnestness
,
and
,
at
every
petty
*NL*
throb
of
his
sensibility
,
turning
for
sympathy
to
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
bright
young
girl
!
*NL*
*NL*
If
once
he
were
fairly
seated
at
the
window
,
even
Pyncheon
Street
would
*NL*
hardly
be
so
dull
and
lonely
but
that
,
somewhere
or
other
along
its
*NL*
extent
,
Clifford
might
discover
matter
to
occupy
his
eye
,
and
*NL*
titillate
,
if
not
engross
,
his
observation
.
Things
familiar
to
the
*NL*
youngest
child
that
had
begun
its
outlook
at
existence
seemed
strange
*NL*
to
him
.
A
cab
;
an
omnibus
,
with
its
populous
interior
,
dropping
here
*NL*
and
there
a
passenger
,
and
picking
up
another
,
and
thus
typifying
that
*NL*
vast
rolling
vehicle
,
the
world
,
the
end
of
whose
journey
is
everywhere
*NL*
and
nowhere
;
these
objects
he
followed
eagerly
with
his
eyes
,
but
*NL*
forgot
them
before
the
dust
raised
by
the
horses
and
wheels
had
settled
*NL*
along
their
track
.
As
regarded
novelties
-LRB-
among
which
cabs
and
*NL*
omnibuses
were
to
be
reckoned
-RRB-
,
his
mind
appeared
to
have
lost
its
*NL*
proper
gripe
and
retentiveness
.
Twice
or
thrice
,
for
example
,
during
*NL*
the
sunny
hours
of
the
day
,
a
water-cart
went
along
by
the
Pyncheon
*NL*
House
,
leaving
a
broad
wake
of
moistened
earth
,
instead
of
the
white
*NL*
dust
that
had
risen
at
a
lady
's
lightest
footfall
;
it
was
like
a
summer
*NL*
shower
,
which
the
city
authorities
had
caught
and
tamed
,
and
compelled
*NL*
it
into
the
commonest
routine
of
their
convenience
.
With
the
*NL*
water-cart
Clifford
could
never
grow
familiar
;
it
always
affected
him
*NL*
with
just
the
same
surprise
as
at
first
.
His
mind
took
an
apparently
*NL*
sharp
impression
from
it
,
but
lost
the
recollection
of
this
*NL*
perambulatory
shower
,
before
its
next
reappearance
,
as
completely
as
*NL*
did
the
street
itself
,
along
which
the
heat
so
quickly
strewed
white
*NL*
dust
again
.
It
was
the
same
with
the
railroad
.
Clifford
could
hear
*NL*
the
obstreperous
howl
of
the
steam-devil
,
and
,
by
leaning
a
little
way
*NL*
from
the
arched
window
,
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
trains
of
cars
,
*NL*
flashing
a
brief
transit
across
the
extremity
of
the
street
.
The
idea
*NL*
of
terrible
energy
thus
forced
upon
him
was
new
at
every
recurrence
,
*NL*
and
seemed
to
affect
him
as
disagreeably
,
and
with
almost
as
much
*NL*
surprise
,
the
hundredth
time
as
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
gives
a
sadder
sense
of
decay
than
this
loss
or
suspension
of
*NL*
the
power
to
deal
with
unaccustomed
things
,
and
to
keep
up
with
the
*NL*
swiftness
of
the
passing
moment
.
It
can
merely
be
a
suspended
*NL*
animation
;
for
,
were
the
power
actually
to
perish
,
there
would
be
*NL*
little
use
of
immortality
.
We
are
less
than
ghosts
,
for
the
time
*NL*
being
,
whenever
this
calamity
befalls
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clifford
was
indeed
the
most
inveterate
of
conservatives
.
All
the
*NL*
antique
fashions
of
the
street
were
dear
to
him
;
even
such
as
were
*NL*
characterized
by
a
rudeness
that
would
naturally
have
annoyed
his
*NL*
fastidious
senses
.
He
loved
the
old
rumbling
and
jolting
carts
,
the
*NL*
former
track
of
which
he
still
found
in
his
long-buried
remembrance
,
as
*NL*
the
observer
of
to-day
finds
the
wheel-tracks
of
ancient
vehicles
in
*NL*
Herculaneum
.
The
butcher
's
cart
,
with
its
snowy
canopy
,
was
an
*NL*
acceptable
object
;
so
was
the
fish-cart
,
heralded
by
its
horn
;
so
,
*NL*
likewise
,
was
the
countryman
's
cart
of
vegetables
,
plodding
from
door
*NL*
to
door
,
with
long
pauses
of
the
patient
horse
,
while
his
owner
drove
a
*NL*
trade
in
turnips
,
carrots
,
summer-squashes
,
string-beans
,
green
peas
,
*NL*
and
new
potatoes
,
with
half
the
housewives
of
the
neighborhood
.
The
*NL*
baker
's
cart
,
with
the
harsh
music
of
its
bells
,
had
a
pleasant
effect
*NL*
on
Clifford
,
because
,
as
few
things
else
did
,
it
jingled
the
very
*NL*
dissonance
of
yore
.
One
afternoon
a
scissor-grinder
chanced
to
set
his
*NL*
wheel
a-going
under
the
Pyncheon
Elm
,
and
just
in
front
of
the
arched
*NL*
window
.
Children
came
running
with
their
mothers
'
scissors
,
or
the
*NL*
carving-knife
,
or
the
paternal
razor
,
or
anything
else
that
lacked
an
*NL*
edge
-LRB-
except
,
indeed
,
poor
Clifford
's
wits
-RRB-
,
that
the
grinder
might
*NL*
apply
the
article
to
his
magic
wheel
,
and
give
it
back
as
good
as
new
.
*NL*
Round
went
the
busily
revolving
machinery
,
kept
in
motion
by
the
*NL*
scissor-grinder
's
foot
,
and
wore
away
the
hard
steel
against
the
hard
*NL*
stone
,
whence
issued
an
intense
and
spiteful
prolongation
of
a
hiss
as
*NL*
fierce
as
those
emitted
by
Satan
and
his
compeers
in
Pandemonium
,
*NL*
though
squeezed
into
smaller
compass
.
It
was
an
ugly
,
little
,
venomous
*NL*
serpent
of
a
noise
,
as
ever
did
petty
violence
to
human
ears
.
But
*NL*
Clifford
listened
with
rapturous
delight
.
The
sound
,
however
*NL*
disagreeable
,
had
very
brisk
life
in
it
,
and
,
together
with
the
circle
*NL*
of
curious
children
watching
the
revolutions
of
the
wheel
,
appeared
to
*NL*
give
him
a
more
vivid
sense
of
active
,
bustling
,
and
sunshiny
existence
*NL*
than
he
had
attained
in
almost
any
other
way
.
Nevertheless
,
its
charm
*NL*
lay
chiefly
in
the
past
;
for
the
scissor-grinder
's
wheel
had
hissed
in
*NL*
his
childish
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sometimes
made
doleful
complaint
that
there
were
no
stage-coaches
*NL*
nowadays
.
And
he
asked
in
an
injured
tone
what
had
become
of
all
those
*NL*
old
square-topped
chaises
,
with
wings
sticking
out
on
either
side
,
that
*NL*
used
to
be
drawn
by
a
plough-horse
,
and
driven
by
a
farmer
's
wife
and
*NL*
daughter
,
peddling
whortle-berries
and
blackberries
about
the
town
.
*NL*
Their
disappearance
made
him
doubt
,
he
said
,
whether
the
berries
had
*NL*
not
left
off
growing
in
the
broad
pastures
and
along
the
shady
country
*NL*
lanes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
anything
that
appealed
to
the
sense
of
beauty
,
in
however
humble
a
*NL*
way
,
did
not
require
to
be
recommended
by
these
old
associations
.
This
*NL*
was
observable
when
one
of
those
Italian
boys
-LRB-
who
are
rather
a
modern
*NL*
feature
of
our
streets
-RRB-
came
along
with
his
barrel-organ
,
and
stopped
*NL*
under
the
wide
and
cool
shadows
of
the
elm
.
With
his
quick
*NL*
professional
eye
he
took
note
of
the
two
faces
watching
him
from
the
*NL*
arched
window
,
and
,
opening
his
instrument
,
began
to
scatter
its
*NL*
melodies
abroad
.
He
had
a
monkey
on
his
shoulder
,
dressed
in
a
*NL*
Highland
plaid
;
and
,
to
complete
the
sum
of
splendid
attractions
*NL*
wherewith
he
presented
himself
to
the
public
,
there
was
a
company
of
*NL*
little
figures
,
whose
sphere
and
habitation
was
in
the
mahogany
case
of
*NL*
his
organ
,
and
whose
principle
of
life
was
the
music
which
the
Italian
*NL*
made
it
his
business
to
grind
out
.
In
all
their
variety
of
*NL*
occupation
,
--
the
cobbler
,
the
blacksmith
,
the
soldier
,
the
lady
with
*NL*
her
fan
,
the
toper
with
his
bottle
,
the
milk-maid
sitting
by
her
*NL*
cow
--
this
fortunate
little
society
might
truly
be
said
to
enjoy
a
*NL*
harmonious
existence
,
and
to
make
life
literally
a
dance
.
The
Italian
*NL*
turned
a
crank
;
and
,
behold
!
every
one
of
these
small
individuals
*NL*
started
into
the
most
curious
vivacity
.
The
cobbler
wrought
upon
a
*NL*
shoe
;
the
blacksmith
hammered
his
iron
,
the
soldier
waved
his
*NL*
glittering
blade
;
the
lady
raised
a
tiny
breeze
with
her
fan
;
the
jolly
*NL*
toper
swigged
lustily
at
his
bottle
;
a
scholar
opened
his
book
with
*NL*
eager
thirst
for
knowledge
,
and
turned
his
head
to
and
fro
along
the
*NL*
page
;
the
milkmaid
energetically
drained
her
cow
;
and
a
miser
counted
*NL*
gold
into
his
strong-box
,
--
all
at
the
same
turning
of
a
crank
.
Yes
;
*NL*
and
,
moved
by
the
self-same
impulse
,
a
lover
saluted
his
mistress
on
*NL*
her
lips
!
Possibly
some
cynic
,
at
once
merry
and
bitter
,
had
desired
to
*NL*
signify
,
in
this
pantomimic
scene
,
that
we
mortals
,
whatever
our
*NL*
business
or
amusement
,
--
however
serious
,
however
trifling
,
--
all
dance
*NL*
to
one
identical
tune
,
and
,
in
spite
of
our
ridiculous
activity
,
bring
*NL*
nothing
finally
to
pass
.
For
the
most
remarkable
aspect
of
the
affair
*NL*
was
,
that
,
at
the
cessation
of
the
music
,
everybody
was
petrified
at
*NL*
once
,
from
the
most
extravagant
life
into
a
dead
torpor
.
Neither
was
*NL*
the
cobbler
's
shoe
finished
,
nor
the
blacksmith
's
iron
shaped
out
;
nor
*NL*
was
there
a
drop
less
of
brandy
in
the
toper
's
bottle
,
nor
a
drop
more
*NL*
of
milk
in
the
milkmaid
's
pail
,
nor
one
additional
coin
in
the
miser
's
*NL*
strong-box
,
nor
was
the
scholar
a
page
deeper
in
his
book
.
All
were
*NL*
precisely
in
the
same
condition
as
before
they
made
themselves
so
*NL*
ridiculous
by
their
haste
to
toil
,
to
enjoy
,
to
accumulate
gold
,
and
to
*NL*
become
wise
.
Saddest
of
all
,
moreover
,
the
lover
was
none
the
happier
*NL*
for
the
maiden
's
granted
kiss
!
But
,
rather
than
swallow
this
last
too
*NL*
acrid
ingredient
,
we
reject
the
whole
moral
of
the
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
monkey
,
meanwhile
,
with
a
thick
tail
curling
out
into
preposterous
*NL*
prolixity
from
beneath
his
tartans
,
took
his
station
at
the
Italian
's
*NL*
feet
.
He
turned
a
wrinkled
and
abominable
little
visage
to
every
*NL*
passer-by
,
and
to
the
circle
of
children
that
soon
gathered
round
,
and
*NL*
to
Hepzibah
's
shop-door
,
and
upward
to
the
arched
window
,
whence
Phoebe
*NL*
and
Clifford
were
looking
down
.
Every
moment
,
also
,
he
took
off
his
*NL*
Highland
bonnet
,
and
performed
a
bow
and
scrape
.
Sometimes
,
moreover
,
*NL*
he
made
personal
application
to
individuals
,
holding
out
his
small
*NL*
black
palm
,
and
otherwise
plainly
signifying
his
excessive
desire
for
*NL*
whatever
filthy
lucre
might
happen
to
be
in
anybody
's
pocket
.
The
mean
*NL*
and
low
,
yet
strangely
man-like
expression
of
his
wilted
countenance
;
*NL*
the
prying
and
crafty
glance
,
that
showed
him
ready
to
gripe
at
every
*NL*
miserable
advantage
;
his
enormous
tail
-LRB-
too
enormous
to
be
decently
*NL*
concealed
under
his
gabardine
-RRB-
,
and
the
deviltry
of
nature
which
it
*NL*
betokened
,
--
take
this
monkey
just
as
he
was
,
in
short
,
and
you
could
*NL*
desire
no
better
image
of
the
Mammon
of
copper
coin
,
symbolizing
the
*NL*
grossest
form
of
the
love
of
money
.
Neither
was
there
any
possibility
*NL*
of
satisfying
the
covetous
little
devil
.
Phoebe
threw
down
a
whole
*NL*
handful
of
cents
,
which
he
picked
up
with
joyless
eagerness
,
handed
*NL*
them
over
to
the
Italian
for
safekeeping
,
and
immediately
recommenced
a
*NL*
series
of
pantomimic
petitions
for
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doubtless
,
more
than
one
New-Englander
--
or
,
let
him
be
of
what
country
*NL*
he
might
,
it
is
as
likely
to
be
the
case
--
passed
by
,
and
threw
a
look
*NL*
at
the
monkey
,
and
went
on
,
without
imagining
how
nearly
his
own
moral
*NL*
condition
was
here
exemplified
.
Clifford
,
however
,
was
a
being
of
*NL*
another
order
.
He
had
taken
childish
delight
in
the
music
,
and
smiled
,
*NL*
too
,
at
the
figures
which
it
set
in
motion
.
But
,
after
looking
awhile
*NL*
at
the
long-tailed
imp
,
he
was
so
shocked
by
his
horrible
ugliness
,
*NL*
spiritual
as
well
as
physical
,
that
he
actually
began
to
shed
tears
;
a
*NL*
weakness
which
men
of
merely
delicate
endowments
,
and
destitute
of
the
*NL*
fiercer
,
deeper
,
and
more
tragic
power
of
laughter
,
can
hardly
avoid
,
*NL*
when
the
worst
and
meanest
aspect
of
life
happens
to
be
presented
to
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pyncheon
Street
was
sometimes
enlivened
by
spectacles
of
more
imposing
*NL*
pretensions
than
the
above
,
and
which
brought
the
multitude
along
with
*NL*
them
.
With
a
shivering
repugnance
at
the
idea
of
personal
contact
with
*NL*
the
world
,
a
powerful
impulse
still
seized
on
Clifford
,
whenever
the
*NL*
rush
and
roar
of
the
human
tide
grew
strongly
audible
to
him
.
This
was
*NL*
made
evident
,
one
day
,
when
a
political
procession
,
with
hundreds
of
*NL*
flaunting
banners
,
and
drums
,
fifes
,
clarions
,
and
cymbals
,
*NL*
reverberating
between
the
rows
of
buildings
,
marched
all
through
town
,
*NL*
and
trailed
its
length
of
trampling
footsteps
,
and
most
infrequent
*NL*
uproar
,
past
the
ordinarily
quiet
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
As
a
mere
*NL*
object
of
sight
,
nothing
is
more
deficient
in
picturesque
features
than
*NL*
a
procession
seen
in
its
passage
through
narrow
streets
.
The
spectator
*NL*
feels
it
to
be
fool
's
play
,
when
he
can
distinguish
the
tedious
*NL*
commonplace
of
each
man
's
visage
,
with
the
perspiration
and
weary
*NL*
self-importance
on
it
,
and
the
very
cut
of
his
pantaloons
,
and
the
*NL*
stiffness
or
laxity
of
his
shirt-collar
,
and
the
dust
on
the
back
of
*NL*
his
black
coat
.
In
order
to
become
majestic
,
it
should
be
viewed
from
*NL*
some
vantage
point
,
as
it
rolls
its
slow
and
long
array
through
the
*NL*
centre
of
a
wide
plain
,
or
the
stateliest
public
square
of
a
city
;
for
*NL*
then
,
by
its
remoteness
,
it
melts
all
the
petty
personalities
,
of
which
*NL*
it
is
made
up
,
into
one
broad
mass
of
existence
,
--
one
great
life
,
--
one
*NL*
collected
body
of
mankind
,
with
a
vast
,
homogeneous
spirit
animating
*NL*
it
.
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
if
an
impressible
person
,
standing
alone
*NL*
over
the
brink
of
one
of
these
processions
,
should
behold
it
,
not
in
*NL*
its
atoms
,
but
in
its
aggregate
,
--
as
a
mighty
river
of
life
,
massive
in
*NL*
its
tide
,
and
black
with
mystery
,
and
,
out
of
its
depths
,
calling
to
*NL*
the
kindred
depth
within
him
,
--
then
the
contiguity
would
add
to
the
*NL*
effect
.
It
might
so
fascinate
him
that
he
would
hardly
be
restrained
*NL*
from
plunging
into
the
surging
stream
of
human
sympathies
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
proved
with
Clifford
.
He
shuddered
;
he
grew
pale
;
he
threw
an
*NL*
appealing
look
at
Hepzibah
and
Phoebe
,
who
were
with
him
at
the
window
.
*NL*
They
comprehended
nothing
of
his
emotions
,
and
supposed
him
merely
*NL*
disturbed
by
the
unaccustomed
tumult
.
At
last
,
with
tremulous
limbs
,
*NL*
he
started
up
,
set
his
foot
on
the
window-sill
,
and
in
an
instant
more
*NL*
would
have
been
in
the
unguarded
balcony
.
As
it
was
,
the
whole
*NL*
procession
might
have
seen
him
,
a
wild
,
haggard
figure
,
his
gray
locks
*NL*
floating
in
the
wind
that
waved
their
banners
;
a
lonely
being
,
*NL*
estranged
from
his
race
,
but
now
feeling
himself
man
again
,
by
virtue
*NL*
of
the
irrepressible
instinct
that
possessed
him
.
Had
Clifford
*NL*
attained
the
balcony
,
he
would
probably
have
leaped
into
the
street
;
*NL*
but
whether
impelled
by
the
species
of
terror
that
sometimes
urges
its
*NL*
victim
over
the
very
precipice
which
he
shrinks
from
,
or
by
a
natural
*NL*
magnetism
,
tending
towards
the
great
centre
of
humanity
,
it
were
not
*NL*
easy
to
decide
.
Both
impulses
might
have
wrought
on
him
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
companions
,
affrighted
by
his
gesture
,
--
which
was
that
of
a
man
*NL*
hurried
away
in
spite
of
himself
,
--
seized
Clifford
's
garment
and
held
*NL*
him
back
.
Hepzibah
shrieked
.
Phoebe
,
to
whom
all
extravagance
was
a
*NL*
horror
,
burst
into
sobs
and
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clifford
,
Clifford
!
are
you
crazy
?
''
cried
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
know
,
Hepzibah
,
''
said
Clifford
,
drawing
a
long
breath
.
``
Fear
*NL*
nothing
,
--
it
is
over
now
,
--
but
had
I
taken
that
plunge
,
and
survived
*NL*
it
,
methinks
it
would
have
made
me
another
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Possibly
,
in
some
sense
,
Clifford
may
have
been
right
.
He
needed
a
*NL*
shock
;
or
perhaps
he
required
to
take
a
deep
,
deep
plunge
into
the
*NL*
ocean
of
human
life
,
and
to
sink
down
and
be
covered
by
its
*NL*
profoundness
,
and
then
to
emerge
,
sobered
,
invigorated
,
restored
to
the
*NL*
world
and
to
himself
.
Perhaps
again
,
he
required
nothing
less
than
the
*NL*
great
final
remedy
--
death
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
similar
yearning
to
renew
the
broken
links
of
brotherhood
with
his
*NL*
kind
sometimes
showed
itself
in
a
milder
form
;
and
once
it
was
made
*NL*
beautiful
by
the
religion
that
lay
even
deeper
than
itself
.
In
the
*NL*
incident
now
to
be
sketched
,
there
was
a
touching
recognition
,
on
*NL*
Clifford
's
part
,
of
God
's
care
and
love
towards
him
,
--
towards
this
*NL*
poor
,
forsaken
man
,
who
,
if
any
mortal
could
,
might
have
been
pardoned
*NL*
for
regarding
himself
as
thrown
aside
,
forgotten
,
and
left
to
be
the
*NL*
sport
of
some
fiend
,
whose
playfulness
was
an
ecstasy
of
mischief
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
Sabbath
morning
;
one
of
those
bright
,
calm
Sabbaths
,
with
*NL*
its
own
hallowed
atmosphere
,
when
Heaven
seems
to
diffuse
itself
over
*NL*
the
earth
's
face
in
a
solemn
smile
,
no
less
sweet
than
solemn
.
On
such
*NL*
a
Sabbath
morn
,
were
we
pure
enough
to
be
its
medium
,
we
should
be
*NL*
conscious
of
the
earth
's
natural
worship
ascending
through
our
frames
,
*NL*
on
whatever
spot
of
ground
we
stood
.
The
church-bells
,
with
various
*NL*
tones
,
but
all
in
harmony
,
were
calling
out
and
responding
to
one
*NL*
another
,
--
``
It
is
the
Sabbath
!
--
The
Sabbath
!
--
Yea
;
the
Sabbath
!
''
--
and
*NL*
over
the
whole
city
the
bells
scattered
the
blessed
sounds
,
now
slowly
,
*NL*
now
with
livelier
joy
,
now
one
bell
alone
,
now
all
the
bells
together
,
*NL*
crying
earnestly
,
--
``
It
is
the
Sabbath
!
''
--
and
flinging
their
accents
*NL*
afar
off
,
to
melt
into
the
air
and
pervade
it
with
the
holy
word
.
The
*NL*
air
with
God
's
sweetest
and
tenderest
sunshine
in
it
,
was
meet
for
*NL*
mankind
to
breathe
into
their
hearts
,
and
send
it
forth
again
as
the
*NL*
utterance
of
prayer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clifford
sat
at
the
window
with
Hepzibah
,
watching
the
neighbors
as
*NL*
they
stepped
into
the
street
.
All
of
them
,
however
unspiritual
on
*NL*
other
days
,
were
transfigured
by
the
Sabbath
influence
;
so
that
their
*NL*
very
garments
--
whether
it
were
an
old
man
's
decent
coat
well
brushed
*NL*
for
the
thousandth
time
,
or
a
little
boy
's
first
sack
and
trousers
*NL*
finished
yesterday
by
his
mother
's
needle
--
had
somewhat
of
the
quality
*NL*
of
ascension-robes
.
Forth
,
likewise
,
from
the
portal
of
the
old
house
*NL*
stepped
Phoebe
,
putting
up
her
small
green
sunshade
,
and
throwing
*NL*
upward
a
glance
and
smile
of
parting
kindness
to
the
faces
at
the
*NL*
arched
window
.
In
her
aspect
there
was
a
familiar
gladness
,
and
a
*NL*
holiness
that
you
could
play
with
,
and
yet
reverence
it
as
much
as
*NL*
ever
.
She
was
like
a
prayer
,
offered
up
in
the
homeliest
beauty
of
*NL*
one
's
mother-tongue
.
Fresh
was
Phoebe
,
moreover
,
and
airy
and
sweet
in
*NL*
her
apparel
;
as
if
nothing
that
she
wore
--
neither
her
gown
,
nor
her
*NL*
small
straw
bonnet
,
nor
her
little
kerchief
,
any
more
than
her
snowy
*NL*
stockings
--
had
ever
been
put
on
before
;
or
,
if
worn
,
were
all
the
*NL*
fresher
for
it
,
and
with
a
fragrance
as
if
they
had
lain
among
the
*NL*
rosebuds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
waved
her
hand
to
Hepzibah
and
Clifford
,
and
went
up
the
*NL*
street
;
a
religion
in
herself
,
warm
,
simple
,
true
,
with
a
substance
*NL*
that
could
walk
on
earth
,
and
a
spirit
that
was
capable
of
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hepzibah
,
''
asked
Clifford
,
after
watching
Phoebe
to
the
corner
,
``
do
*NL*
you
never
go
to
church
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Clifford
!
''
she
replied
,
--
``
not
these
many
,
many
years
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
I
to
be
there
,
''
he
rejoined
,
``
it
seems
to
me
that
I
could
pray
*NL*
once
more
,
when
so
many
human
souls
were
praying
all
around
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
into
Clifford
's
face
,
and
beheld
there
a
soft
natural
*NL*
effusion
;
for
his
heart
gushed
out
,
as
it
were
,
and
ran
over
at
his
*NL*
eyes
,
in
delightful
reverence
for
God
,
and
kindly
affection
for
his
*NL*
human
brethren
.
The
emotion
communicated
itself
to
Hepzibah
.
She
*NL*
yearned
to
take
him
by
the
hand
,
and
go
and
kneel
down
,
they
two
*NL*
together
,
--
both
so
long
separate
from
the
world
,
and
,
as
she
now
*NL*
recognized
,
scarcely
friends
with
Him
above
,
--
to
kneel
down
among
the
*NL*
people
,
and
be
reconciled
to
God
and
man
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
brother
,
''
said
she
earnestly
,
``
let
us
go
!
We
belong
nowhere
.
We
*NL*
have
not
a
foot
of
space
in
any
church
to
kneel
upon
;
but
let
us
go
to
*NL*
some
place
of
worship
,
even
if
we
stand
in
the
broad
aisle
.
Poor
and
*NL*
forsaken
as
we
are
,
some
pew-door
will
be
opened
to
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Hepzibah
and
her
brother
made
themselves
,
ready
--
as
ready
as
they
*NL*
could
in
the
best
of
their
old-fashioned
garments
,
which
had
hung
on
*NL*
pegs
,
or
been
laid
away
in
trunks
,
so
long
that
the
dampness
and
mouldy
*NL*
smell
of
the
past
was
on
them
,
--
made
themselves
ready
,
in
their
faded
*NL*
bettermost
,
to
go
to
church
.
They
descended
the
staircase
*NL*
together
,
--
gaunt
,
sallow
Hepzibah
,
and
pale
,
emaciated
,
age-stricken
*NL*
Clifford
!
They
pulled
open
the
front
door
,
and
stepped
across
the
*NL*
threshold
,
and
felt
,
both
of
them
,
as
if
they
were
standing
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
whole
world
,
and
with
mankind
's
great
and
terrible
eye
*NL*
on
them
alone
.
The
eye
of
their
Father
seemed
to
be
withdrawn
,
and
*NL*
gave
them
no
encouragement
.
The
warm
sunny
air
of
the
street
made
them
*NL*
shiver
.
Their
hearts
quaked
within
them
at
the
idea
of
taking
one
*NL*
step
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be
,
Hepzibah
!
--
it
is
too
late
,
''
said
Clifford
with
deep
*NL*
sadness
.
``
We
are
ghosts
!
We
have
no
right
among
human
beings
,
--
no
*NL*
right
anywhere
but
in
this
old
house
,
which
has
a
curse
on
it
,
and
*NL*
which
,
therefore
,
we
are
doomed
to
haunt
!
And
,
besides
,
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
with
a
fastidious
sensibility
,
inalienably
characteristic
of
the
man
,
*NL*
``
it
would
not
be
fit
nor
beautiful
to
go
!
It
is
an
ugly
thought
that
I
*NL*
should
be
frightful
to
my
fellow-beings
,
and
that
children
would
cling
*NL*
to
their
mothers
'
gowns
at
sight
of
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
shrank
back
into
the
dusky
passage-way
,
and
closed
the
door
.
But
,
*NL*
going
up
the
staircase
again
,
they
found
the
whole
interior
of
the
*NL*
house
tenfold
more
dismal
,
and
the
air
closer
and
heavier
,
for
the
*NL*
glimpse
and
breath
of
freedom
which
they
had
just
snatched
.
They
could
*NL*
not
flee
;
their
jailer
had
but
left
the
door
ajar
in
mockery
,
and
stood
*NL*
behind
it
to
watch
them
stealing
out
.
At
the
threshold
,
they
felt
his
*NL*
pitiless
gripe
upon
them
.
For
,
what
other
dungeon
is
so
dark
as
one
's
*NL*
own
heart
!
What
jailer
so
inexorable
as
one
's
self
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
would
be
no
fair
picture
of
Clifford
's
state
of
mind
were
we
to
*NL*
represent
him
as
continually
or
prevailingly
wretched
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
there
was
no
other
man
in
the
city
,
we
are
bold
to
affirm
,
of
*NL*
so
much
as
half
his
years
,
who
enjoyed
so
many
lightsome
and
griefless
*NL*
moments
as
himself
.
He
had
no
burden
of
care
upon
him
;
there
were
none
*NL*
of
those
questions
and
contingencies
with
the
future
to
be
settled
*NL*
which
wear
away
all
other
lives
,
and
render
them
not
worth
having
by
*NL*
the
very
process
of
providing
for
their
support
.
In
this
respect
he
*NL*
was
a
child
,
--
a
child
for
the
whole
term
of
his
existence
,
be
it
long
*NL*
or
short
.
Indeed
,
his
life
seemed
to
be
standing
still
at
a
period
*NL*
little
in
advance
of
childhood
,
and
to
cluster
all
his
reminiscences
*NL*
about
that
epoch
;
just
as
,
after
the
torpor
of
a
heavy
blow
,
the
*NL*
sufferer
's
reviving
consciousness
goes
back
to
a
moment
considerably
*NL*
behind
the
accident
that
stupefied
him
.
He
sometimes
told
Phoebe
and
*NL*
Hepzibah
his
dreams
,
in
which
he
invariably
played
the
part
of
a
child
,
*NL*
or
a
very
young
man
.
So
vivid
were
they
,
in
his
relation
of
them
,
that
*NL*
he
once
held
a
dispute
with
his
sister
as
to
the
particular
figure
or
*NL*
print
of
a
chintz
morning-dress
which
he
had
seen
their
mother
wear
,
in
*NL*
the
dream
of
the
preceding
night
.
Hepzibah
,
piquing
herself
on
a
*NL*
woman
's
accuracy
in
such
matters
,
held
it
to
be
slightly
different
from
*NL*
what
Clifford
described
;
but
,
producing
the
very
gown
from
an
old
*NL*
trunk
,
it
proved
to
be
identical
with
his
remembrance
of
it
.
Had
*NL*
Clifford
,
every
time
that
he
emerged
out
of
dreams
so
lifelike
,
*NL*
undergone
the
torture
of
transformation
from
a
boy
into
an
old
and
*NL*
broken
man
,
the
daily
recurrence
of
the
shock
would
have
been
too
much
*NL*
to
bear
.
It
would
have
caused
an
acute
agony
to
thrill
from
the
*NL*
morning
twilight
,
all
the
day
through
,
until
bedtime
;
and
even
then
*NL*
would
have
mingled
a
dull
,
inscrutable
pain
and
pallid
hue
of
*NL*
misfortune
with
the
visionary
bloom
and
adolescence
of
his
slumber
.
*NL*
But
the
nightly
moonshine
interwove
itself
with
the
morning
mist
,
and
*NL*
enveloped
him
as
in
a
robe
,
which
he
hugged
about
his
person
,
and
*NL*
seldom
let
realities
pierce
through
;
he
was
not
often
quite
awake
,
but
*NL*
slept
open-eyed
,
and
perhaps
fancied
himself
most
dreaming
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
lingering
always
so
near
his
childhood
,
he
had
sympathies
with
*NL*
children
,
and
kept
his
heart
the
fresher
thereby
,
like
a
reservoir
into
*NL*
which
rivulets
were
pouring
not
far
from
the
fountain-head
.
Though
*NL*
prevented
,
by
a
subtile
sense
of
propriety
,
from
desiring
to
associate
*NL*
with
them
,
he
loved
few
things
better
than
to
look
out
of
the
arched
*NL*
window
and
see
a
little
girl
driving
her
hoop
along
the
sidewalk
,
or
*NL*
schoolboys
at
a
game
of
ball
.
Their
voices
,
also
,
were
very
pleasant
*NL*
to
him
,
heard
at
a
distance
,
all
swarming
and
intermingling
together
as
*NL*
flies
do
in
a
sunny
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clifford
would
,
doubtless
,
have
been
glad
to
share
their
sports
.
One
*NL*
afternoon
he
was
seized
with
an
irresistible
desire
to
blow
*NL*
soap-bubbles
;
an
amusement
,
as
Hepzibah
told
Phoebe
apart
,
that
had
*NL*
been
a
favorite
one
with
her
brother
when
they
were
both
children
.
*NL*
Behold
him
,
therefore
,
at
the
arched
window
,
with
an
earthen
pipe
in
*NL*
his
mouth
!
Behold
him
,
with
his
gray
hair
,
and
a
wan
,
unreal
smile
over
*NL*
his
countenance
,
where
still
hovered
a
beautiful
grace
,
which
his
worst
*NL*
enemy
must
have
acknowledged
to
be
spiritual
and
immortal
,
since
it
had
*NL*
survived
so
long
!
Behold
him
,
scattering
airy
spheres
abroad
from
the
*NL*
window
into
the
street
!
Little
impalpable
worlds
were
those
*NL*
soap-bubbles
,
with
the
big
world
depicted
,
in
hues
bright
as
*NL*
imagination
,
on
the
nothing
of
their
surface
.
It
was
curious
to
see
*NL*
how
the
passers-by
regarded
these
brilliant
fantasies
,
as
they
came
*NL*
floating
down
,
and
made
the
dull
atmosphere
imaginative
about
them
.
*NL*
Some
stopped
to
gaze
,
and
perhaps
,
carried
a
pleasant
recollection
of
*NL*
the
bubbles
onward
as
far
as
the
street-corner
;
some
looked
angrily
*NL*
upward
,
as
if
poor
Clifford
wronged
them
by
setting
an
image
of
beauty
*NL*
afloat
so
near
their
dusty
pathway
.
A
great
many
put
out
their
fingers
*NL*
or
their
walking-sticks
to
touch
,
withal
;
and
were
perversely
*NL*
gratified
,
no
doubt
,
when
the
bubble
,
with
all
its
pictured
earth
and
*NL*
sky
scene
,
vanished
as
if
it
had
never
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
just
as
an
elderly
gentleman
of
very
dignified
presence
*NL*
happened
to
be
passing
,
a
large
bubble
sailed
majestically
down
,
and
*NL*
burst
right
against
his
nose
!
He
looked
up
,
--
at
first
with
a
stern
,
*NL*
keen
glance
,
which
penetrated
at
once
into
the
obscurity
behind
the
*NL*
arched
window
,
--
then
with
a
smile
which
might
be
conceived
as
diffusing
*NL*
a
dog-day
sultriness
for
the
space
of
several
yards
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
,
Cousin
Clifford
!
''
cried
Judge
Pyncheon
.
``
What
!
Still
blowing
*NL*
soap-bubbles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
seemed
as
if
meant
to
be
kind
and
soothing
,
but
yet
had
a
*NL*
bitterness
of
sarcasm
in
it
.
As
for
Clifford
,
an
absolute
palsy
of
*NL*
fear
came
over
him
.
Apart
from
any
definite
cause
of
dread
which
his
*NL*
past
experience
might
have
given
him
,
he
felt
that
native
and
original
*NL*
horror
of
the
excellent
Judge
which
is
proper
to
a
weak
,
delicate
,
and
*NL*
apprehensive
character
in
the
presence
of
massive
strength
.
Strength
*NL*
is
incomprehensible
by
weakness
,
and
,
therefore
,
the
more
terrible
.
*NL*
There
is
no
greater
bugbear
than
a
strong-willed
relative
in
the
circle
*NL*
of
his
own
connections
.

XII
The
Daguerreotypist
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
life
of
a
personage
naturally
so
*NL*
active
as
Phoebe
could
be
wholly
confined
within
the
precincts
of
the
*NL*
old
Pyncheon
House
.
Clifford
's
demands
upon
her
time
were
usually
*NL*
satisfied
,
in
those
long
days
,
considerably
earlier
than
sunset
.
Quiet
*NL*
as
his
daily
existence
seemed
,
it
nevertheless
drained
all
the
*NL*
resources
by
which
he
lived
.
It
was
not
physical
exercise
that
*NL*
overwearied
him
,
--
for
except
that
he
sometimes
wrought
a
little
with
a
*NL*
hoe
,
or
paced
the
garden-walk
,
or
,
in
rainy
weather
,
traversed
a
large
*NL*
unoccupied
room
,
--
it
was
his
tendency
to
remain
only
too
quiescent
,
as
*NL*
regarded
any
toil
of
the
limbs
and
muscles
.
But
,
either
there
was
a
*NL*
smouldering
fire
within
him
that
consumed
his
vital
energy
,
or
the
*NL*
monotony
that
would
have
dragged
itself
with
benumbing
effect
over
a
*NL*
mind
differently
situated
was
no
monotony
to
Clifford
.
Possibly
,
he
*NL*
was
in
a
state
of
second
growth
and
recovery
,
and
was
constantly
*NL*
assimilating
nutriment
for
his
spirit
and
intellect
from
sights
,
*NL*
sounds
,
and
events
which
passed
as
a
perfect
void
to
persons
more
*NL*
practised
with
the
world
.
As
all
is
activity
and
vicissitude
to
the
*NL*
new
mind
of
a
child
,
so
might
it
be
,
likewise
,
to
a
mind
that
had
*NL*
undergone
a
kind
of
new
creation
,
after
its
long-suspended
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Be
the
cause
what
it
might
,
Clifford
commonly
retired
to
rest
,
*NL*
thoroughly
exhausted
,
while
the
sunbeams
were
still
melting
through
his
*NL*
window-curtains
,
or
were
thrown
with
late
lustre
on
the
chamber
wall
.
*NL*
And
while
he
thus
slept
early
,
as
other
children
do
,
and
dreamed
of
*NL*
childhood
,
Phoebe
was
free
to
follow
her
own
tastes
for
the
remainder
*NL*
of
the
day
and
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
freedom
essential
to
the
health
even
of
a
character
so
*NL*
little
susceptible
of
morbid
influences
as
that
of
Phoebe
.
The
old
*NL*
house
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
had
both
the
dry-rot
and
the
damp-rot
*NL*
in
its
walls
;
it
was
not
good
to
breathe
no
other
atmosphere
than
that
.
*NL*
Hepzibah
,
though
she
had
her
valuable
and
redeeming
traits
,
had
grown
*NL*
to
be
a
kind
of
lunatic
by
imprisoning
herself
so
long
in
one
place
,
*NL*
with
no
other
company
than
a
single
series
of
ideas
,
and
but
one
*NL*
affection
,
and
one
bitter
sense
of
wrong
.
Clifford
,
the
reader
may
*NL*
perhaps
imagine
,
was
too
inert
to
operate
morally
on
his
*NL*
fellow-creatures
,
however
intimate
and
exclusive
their
relations
with
*NL*
him
.
But
the
sympathy
or
magnetism
among
human
beings
is
more
subtile
*NL*
and
universal
than
we
think
;
it
exists
,
indeed
,
among
different
classes
*NL*
of
organized
life
,
and
vibrates
from
one
to
another
.
A
flower
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
as
Phoebe
herself
observed
,
always
began
to
droop
sooner
in
*NL*
Clifford
's
hand
,
or
Hepzibah
's
,
than
in
her
own
;
and
by
the
same
law
,
*NL*
converting
her
whole
daily
life
into
a
flower
fragrance
for
these
two
*NL*
sickly
spirits
,
the
blooming
girl
must
inevitably
droop
and
fade
much
*NL*
sooner
than
if
worn
on
a
younger
and
happier
breast
.
Unless
she
had
*NL*
now
and
then
indulged
her
brisk
impulses
,
and
breathed
rural
air
in
a
*NL*
suburban
walk
,
or
ocean
breezes
along
the
shore
,
--
had
occasionally
*NL*
obeyed
the
impulse
of
Nature
,
in
New
England
girls
,
by
attending
a
*NL*
metaphysical
or
philosophical
lecture
,
or
viewing
a
seven-mile
*NL*
panorama
,
or
listening
to
a
concert
,
--
had
gone
shopping
about
the
city
,
*NL*
ransacking
entire
depots
of
splendid
merchandise
,
and
bringing
home
a
*NL*
ribbon
,
--
had
employed
,
likewise
,
a
little
time
to
read
the
Bible
in
her
*NL*
chamber
,
and
had
stolen
a
little
more
to
think
of
her
mother
and
her
*NL*
native
place
--
unless
for
such
moral
medicines
as
the
above
,
we
should
*NL*
soon
have
beheld
our
poor
Phoebe
grow
thin
and
put
on
a
bleached
,
*NL*
unwholesome
aspect
,
and
assume
strange
,
shy
ways
,
prophetic
of
*NL*
old-maidenhood
and
a
cheerless
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
as
it
was
,
a
change
grew
visible
;
a
change
partly
to
be
regretted
,
*NL*
although
whatever
charm
it
infringed
upon
was
repaired
by
another
,
*NL*
perhaps
more
precious
.
She
was
not
so
constantly
gay
,
but
had
her
*NL*
moods
of
thought
,
which
Clifford
,
on
the
whole
,
liked
better
than
her
*NL*
former
phase
of
unmingled
cheerfulness
;
because
now
she
understood
him
*NL*
better
and
more
delicately
,
and
sometimes
even
interpreted
him
to
*NL*
himself
.
Her
eyes
looked
larger
,
and
darker
,
and
deeper
;
so
deep
,
at
*NL*
some
silent
moments
,
that
they
seemed
like
Artesian
wells
,
down
,
down
,
*NL*
into
the
infinite
.
She
was
less
girlish
than
when
we
first
beheld
her
*NL*
alighting
from
the
omnibus
;
less
girlish
,
but
more
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
youthful
mind
with
which
Phoebe
had
an
opportunity
of
frequent
*NL*
intercourse
was
that
of
the
daguerreotypist
.
Inevitably
,
by
the
*NL*
pressure
of
the
seclusion
about
them
,
they
had
been
brought
into
habits
*NL*
of
some
familiarity
.
Had
they
met
under
different
circumstances
,
*NL*
neither
of
these
young
persons
would
have
been
likely
to
bestow
much
*NL*
thought
upon
the
other
,
unless
,
indeed
,
their
extreme
dissimilarity
*NL*
should
have
proved
a
principle
of
mutual
attraction
.
Both
,
it
is
true
,
*NL*
were
characters
proper
to
New
England
life
,
and
possessing
a
common
*NL*
ground
,
therefore
,
in
their
more
external
developments
;
but
as
unlike
,
*NL*
in
their
respective
interiors
,
as
if
their
native
climes
had
been
at
*NL*
world-wide
distance
.
During
the
early
part
of
their
acquaintance
,
*NL*
Phoebe
had
held
back
rather
more
than
was
customary
with
her
frank
and
*NL*
simple
manners
from
Holgrave
's
not
very
marked
advances
.
Nor
was
she
*NL*
yet
satisfied
that
she
knew
him
well
,
although
they
almost
daily
met
*NL*
and
talked
together
,
in
a
kind
,
friendly
,
and
what
seemed
to
be
a
*NL*
familiar
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
artist
,
in
a
desultory
manner
,
had
imparted
to
Phoebe
something
of
*NL*
his
history
.
Young
as
he
was
,
and
had
his
career
terminated
at
the
*NL*
point
already
attained
,
there
had
been
enough
of
incident
to
fill
,
very
*NL*
creditably
,
an
autobiographic
volume
.
A
romance
on
the
plan
of
Gil
*NL*
Blas
,
adapted
to
American
society
and
manners
,
would
cease
to
be
a
*NL*
romance
.
The
experience
of
many
individuals
among
us
,
who
think
it
*NL*
hardly
worth
the
telling
,
would
equal
the
vicissitudes
of
the
*NL*
Spaniard
's
earlier
life
;
while
their
ultimate
success
,
or
the
point
*NL*
whither
they
tend
,
may
be
incomparably
higher
than
any
that
a
novelist
*NL*
would
imagine
for
his
hero
.
Holgrave
,
as
he
told
Phoebe
somewhat
*NL*
proudly
,
could
not
boast
of
his
origin
,
unless
as
being
exceedingly
*NL*
humble
,
nor
of
his
education
,
except
that
it
had
been
the
scantiest
*NL*
possible
,
and
obtained
by
a
few
winter-months
'
attendance
at
a
district
*NL*
school
.
Left
early
to
his
own
guidance
,
he
had
begun
to
be
*NL*
self-dependent
while
yet
a
boy
;
and
it
was
a
condition
aptly
suited
to
*NL*
his
natural
force
of
will
.
Though
now
but
twenty-two
years
old
*NL*
-LRB-
lacking
some
months
,
which
are
years
in
such
a
life
-RRB-
,
he
had
already
*NL*
been
,
first
,
a
country
schoolmaster
;
next
,
a
salesman
in
a
country
*NL*
store
;
and
,
either
at
the
same
time
or
afterwards
,
the
political
editor
*NL*
of
a
country
newspaper
.
He
had
subsequently
travelled
New
England
and
*NL*
the
Middle
States
,
as
a
peddler
,
in
the
employment
of
a
Connecticut
*NL*
manufactory
of
cologne-water
and
other
essences
.
In
an
episodical
way
*NL*
he
had
studied
and
practised
dentistry
,
and
with
very
flattering
*NL*
success
,
especially
in
many
of
the
factory-towns
along
our
inland
*NL*
streams
.
As
a
supernumerary
official
,
of
some
kind
or
other
,
aboard
a
*NL*
packet-ship
,
he
had
visited
Europe
,
and
found
means
,
before
his
return
,
*NL*
to
see
Italy
,
and
part
of
France
and
Germany
.
At
a
later
period
he
had
*NL*
spent
some
months
in
a
community
of
Fourierists
.
Still
more
recently
*NL*
he
had
been
a
public
lecturer
on
Mesmerism
,
for
which
science
-LRB-
as
he
*NL*
assured
Phoebe
,
and
,
indeed
,
satisfactorily
proved
,
by
putting
*NL*
Chanticleer
,
who
happened
to
be
scratching
near
by
,
to
sleep
-RRB-
he
had
*NL*
very
remarkable
endowments
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
present
phase
,
as
a
daguerreotypist
,
was
of
no
more
importance
in
*NL*
his
own
view
,
nor
likely
to
be
more
permanent
,
than
any
of
the
*NL*
preceding
ones
.
It
had
been
taken
up
with
the
careless
alacrity
of
an
*NL*
adventurer
,
who
had
his
bread
to
earn
.
It
would
be
thrown
aside
as
*NL*
carelessly
,
whenever
he
should
choose
to
earn
his
bread
by
some
other
*NL*
equally
digressive
means
.
But
what
was
most
remarkable
,
and
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
showed
a
more
than
common
poise
in
the
young
man
,
was
the
fact
that
,
*NL*
amid
all
these
personal
vicissitudes
,
he
had
never
lost
his
identity
.
*NL*
Homeless
as
he
had
been
,
--
continually
changing
his
whereabout
,
and
,
*NL*
therefore
,
responsible
neither
to
public
opinion
nor
to
*NL*
individuals
,
--
putting
off
one
exterior
,
and
snatching
up
another
,
to
be
*NL*
soon
shifted
for
a
third
,
--
he
had
never
violated
the
innermost
man
,
but
*NL*
had
carried
his
conscience
along
with
him
.
It
was
impossible
to
know
*NL*
Holgrave
without
recognizing
this
to
be
the
fact
.
Hepzibah
had
seen
*NL*
it
.
Phoebe
soon
saw
it
likewise
,
and
gave
him
the
sort
of
confidence
*NL*
which
such
a
certainty
inspires
.
She
was
startled
,
however
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
repelled
,
--
not
by
any
doubt
of
his
integrity
to
whatever
law
*NL*
he
acknowledged
,
but
by
a
sense
that
his
law
differed
from
her
own
.
He
*NL*
made
her
uneasy
,
and
seemed
to
unsettle
everything
around
her
,
by
his
*NL*
lack
of
reverence
for
what
was
fixed
,
unless
,
at
a
moment
's
warning
,
it
*NL*
could
establish
its
right
to
hold
its
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
moreover
,
she
scarcely
thought
him
affectionate
in
his
nature
.
*NL*
He
was
too
calm
and
cool
an
observer
.
Phoebe
felt
his
eye
,
often
;
his
*NL*
heart
,
seldom
or
never
.
He
took
a
certain
kind
of
interest
in
Hepzibah
*NL*
and
her
brother
,
and
Phoebe
herself
.
He
studied
them
attentively
,
and
*NL*
allowed
no
slightest
circumstance
of
their
individualities
to
escape
*NL*
him
.
He
was
ready
to
do
them
whatever
good
he
might
;
but
,
after
all
,
*NL*
he
never
exactly
made
common
cause
with
them
,
nor
gave
any
reliable
*NL*
evidence
that
he
loved
them
better
in
proportion
as
he
knew
them
more
.
*NL*
In
his
relations
with
them
,
he
seemed
to
be
in
quest
of
mental
food
,
*NL*
not
heart-sustenance
.
Phoebe
could
not
conceive
what
interested
him
so
*NL*
much
in
her
friends
and
herself
,
intellectually
,
since
he
cared
nothing
*NL*
for
them
,
or
,
comparatively
,
so
little
,
as
objects
of
human
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Always
,
in
his
interviews
with
Phoebe
,
the
artist
made
especial
inquiry
*NL*
as
to
the
welfare
of
Clifford
,
whom
,
except
at
the
Sunday
festival
,
he
*NL*
seldom
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
still
seem
happy
?
''
he
asked
one
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
happy
as
a
child
,
''
answered
Phoebe
;
``
but
--
like
a
child
,
too
--
very
*NL*
easily
disturbed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
disturbed
?
''
inquired
Holgrave
.
``
By
things
without
,
or
by
thoughts
*NL*
within
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
see
his
thoughts
!
How
should
I
?
''
replied
Phoebe
with
simple
*NL*
piquancy
.
``
Very
often
his
humor
changes
without
any
reason
that
can
be
*NL*
guessed
at
,
just
as
a
cloud
comes
over
the
sun
.
Latterly
,
since
I
have
*NL*
begun
to
know
him
better
,
I
feel
it
to
be
not
quite
right
to
look
*NL*
closely
into
his
moods
.
He
has
had
such
a
great
sorrow
,
that
his
heart
*NL*
is
made
all
solemn
and
sacred
by
it
.
When
he
is
cheerful
,
--
when
the
*NL*
sun
shines
into
his
mind
,
--
then
I
venture
to
peep
in
,
just
as
far
as
*NL*
the
light
reaches
,
but
no
further
.
It
is
holy
ground
where
the
shadow
*NL*
falls
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
prettily
you
express
this
sentiment
!
''
said
the
artist
.
``
I
can
*NL*
understand
the
feeling
,
without
possessing
it
.
Had
I
your
*NL*
opportunities
,
no
scruples
would
prevent
me
from
fathoming
Clifford
to
*NL*
the
full
depth
of
my
plummet-line
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
that
you
should
wish
it
!
''
remarked
Phoebe
involuntarily
.
*NL*
``
What
is
Cousin
Clifford
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
,
--
of
course
,
nothing
!
''
answered
Holgrave
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
``
Only
this
is
such
an
odd
and
incomprehensible
world
!
The
more
I
look
*NL*
at
it
,
the
more
it
puzzles
me
,
and
I
begin
to
suspect
that
a
man
's
*NL*
bewilderment
is
the
measure
of
his
wisdom
.
Men
and
women
,
and
*NL*
children
,
too
,
are
such
strange
creatures
,
that
one
never
can
be
*NL*
certain
that
he
really
knows
them
;
nor
ever
guess
what
they
have
been
*NL*
from
what
he
sees
them
to
be
now
.
Judge
Pyncheon
!
Clifford
!
What
a
*NL*
complex
riddle
--
a
complexity
of
complexities
--
do
they
present
!
It
*NL*
requires
intuitive
sympathy
,
like
a
young
girl
's
,
to
solve
it
.
A
mere
*NL*
observer
,
like
myself
-LRB-
who
never
have
any
intuitions
,
and
am
,
at
best
,
*NL*
only
subtile
and
acute
-RRB-
,
is
pretty
certain
to
go
astray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
artist
now
turned
the
conversation
to
themes
less
dark
than
that
*NL*
which
they
had
touched
upon
.
Phoebe
and
he
were
young
together
;
nor
*NL*
had
Holgrave
,
in
his
premature
experience
of
life
,
wasted
entirely
that
*NL*
beautiful
spirit
of
youth
,
which
,
gushing
forth
from
one
small
heart
*NL*
and
fancy
,
may
diffuse
itself
over
the
universe
,
making
it
all
as
*NL*
bright
as
on
the
first
day
of
creation
.
Man
's
own
youth
is
the
world
's
*NL*
youth
;
at
least
,
he
feels
as
if
it
were
,
and
imagines
that
the
earth
's
*NL*
granite
substance
is
something
not
yet
hardened
,
and
which
he
can
mould
*NL*
into
whatever
shape
he
likes
.
So
it
was
with
Holgrave
.
He
could
talk
*NL*
sagely
about
the
world
's
old
age
,
but
never
actually
believed
what
he
*NL*
said
;
he
was
a
young
man
still
,
and
therefore
looked
upon
the
*NL*
world
--
that
gray-bearded
and
wrinkled
profligate
,
decrepit
,
without
*NL*
being
venerable
--
as
a
tender
stripling
,
capable
of
being
improved
into
*NL*
all
that
it
ought
to
be
,
but
scarcely
yet
had
shown
the
remotest
*NL*
promise
of
becoming
.
He
had
that
sense
,
or
inward
prophecy
,
--
which
a
*NL*
young
man
had
better
never
have
been
born
than
not
to
have
,
and
a
*NL*
mature
man
had
better
die
at
once
than
utterly
to
relinquish
,
--
that
we
*NL*
are
not
doomed
to
creep
on
forever
in
the
old
bad
way
,
but
that
,
this
*NL*
very
now
,
there
are
the
harbingers
abroad
of
a
golden
era
,
to
be
*NL*
accomplished
in
his
own
lifetime
.
It
seemed
to
Holgrave
,
--
as
doubtless
*NL*
it
has
seemed
to
the
hopeful
of
every
century
since
the
epoch
of
Adam
's
*NL*
grandchildren
,
--
that
in
this
age
,
more
than
ever
before
,
the
moss-grown
*NL*
and
rotten
Past
is
to
be
torn
down
,
and
lifeless
institutions
to
be
*NL*
thrust
out
of
the
way
,
and
their
dead
corpses
buried
,
and
everything
to
*NL*
begin
anew
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
main
point
,
--
may
we
never
live
to
doubt
it
!
--
as
to
the
better
*NL*
centuries
that
are
coming
,
the
artist
was
surely
right
.
His
error
lay
*NL*
in
supposing
that
this
age
,
more
than
any
past
or
future
one
,
is
*NL*
destined
to
see
the
tattered
garments
of
Antiquity
exchanged
for
a
new
*NL*
suit
,
instead
of
gradually
renewing
themselves
by
patchwork
;
in
*NL*
applying
his
own
little
life-span
as
the
measure
of
an
interminable
*NL*
achievement
;
and
,
more
than
all
,
in
fancying
that
it
mattered
anything
*NL*
to
the
great
end
in
view
whether
he
himself
should
contend
for
it
or
*NL*
against
it
.
Yet
it
was
well
for
him
to
think
so
.
This
enthusiasm
,
*NL*
infusing
itself
through
the
calmness
of
his
character
,
and
thus
taking
*NL*
an
aspect
of
settled
thought
and
wisdom
,
would
serve
to
keep
his
youth
*NL*
pure
,
and
make
his
aspirations
high
.
And
when
,
with
the
years
settling
*NL*
down
more
weightily
upon
him
,
his
early
faith
should
be
modified
by
*NL*
inevitable
experience
,
it
would
be
with
no
harsh
and
sudden
revolution
*NL*
of
his
sentiments
.
He
would
still
have
faith
in
man
's
brightening
*NL*
destiny
,
and
perhaps
love
him
all
the
better
,
as
he
should
recognize
*NL*
his
helplessness
in
his
own
behalf
;
and
the
haughty
faith
,
with
which
*NL*
he
began
life
,
would
be
well
bartered
for
a
far
humbler
one
at
its
*NL*
close
,
in
discerning
that
man
's
best
directed
effort
accomplishes
a
*NL*
kind
of
dream
,
while
God
is
the
sole
worker
of
realities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Holgrave
had
read
very
little
,
and
that
little
in
passing
through
the
*NL*
thoroughfare
of
life
,
where
the
mystic
language
of
his
books
was
*NL*
necessarily
mixed
up
with
the
babble
of
the
multitude
,
so
that
both
one
*NL*
and
the
other
were
apt
to
lose
any
sense
that
might
have
been
properly
*NL*
their
own
.
He
considered
himself
a
thinker
,
and
was
certainly
of
a
*NL*
thoughtful
turn
,
but
,
with
his
own
path
to
discover
,
had
perhaps
hardly
*NL*
yet
reached
the
point
where
an
educated
man
begins
to
think
.
The
true
*NL*
value
of
his
character
lay
in
that
deep
consciousness
of
inward
*NL*
strength
,
which
made
all
his
past
vicissitudes
seem
merely
like
a
*NL*
change
of
garments
;
in
that
enthusiasm
,
so
quiet
that
he
scarcely
knew
*NL*
of
its
existence
,
but
which
gave
a
warmth
to
everything
that
he
laid
*NL*
his
hand
on
;
in
that
personal
ambition
,
hidden
--
from
his
own
as
well
as
*NL*
other
eyes
--
among
his
more
generous
impulses
,
but
in
which
lurked
a
*NL*
certain
efficacy
,
that
might
solidify
him
from
a
theorist
into
the
*NL*
champion
of
some
practicable
cause
.
Altogether
in
his
culture
and
want
*NL*
of
culture
,
--
in
his
crude
,
wild
,
and
misty
philosophy
,
and
the
*NL*
practical
experience
that
counteracted
some
of
its
tendencies
;
in
his
*NL*
magnanimous
zeal
for
man
's
welfare
,
and
his
recklessness
of
whatever
*NL*
the
ages
had
established
in
man
's
behalf
;
in
his
faith
,
and
in
his
*NL*
infidelity
;
in
what
he
had
,
and
in
what
he
lacked
,
--
the
artist
might
*NL*
fitly
enough
stand
forth
as
the
representative
of
many
compeers
in
his
*NL*
native
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
career
it
would
be
difficult
to
prefigure
.
There
appeared
to
be
*NL*
qualities
in
Holgrave
,
such
as
,
in
a
country
where
everything
is
free
*NL*
to
the
hand
that
can
grasp
it
,
could
hardly
fail
to
put
some
of
the
*NL*
world
's
prizes
within
his
reach
.
But
these
matters
are
delightfully
*NL*
uncertain
.
At
almost
every
step
in
life
,
we
meet
with
young
men
of
*NL*
just
about
Holgrave
's
age
,
for
whom
we
anticipate
wonderful
things
,
but
*NL*
of
whom
,
even
after
much
and
careful
inquiry
,
we
never
happen
to
hear
*NL*
another
word
.
The
effervescence
of
youth
and
passion
,
and
the
fresh
*NL*
gloss
of
the
intellect
and
imagination
,
endow
them
with
a
false
*NL*
brilliancy
,
which
makes
fools
of
themselves
and
other
people
.
Like
*NL*
certain
chintzes
,
calicoes
,
and
ginghams
,
they
show
finely
in
their
*NL*
first
newness
,
but
can
not
stand
the
sun
and
rain
,
and
assume
a
very
*NL*
sober
aspect
after
washing-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
our
business
is
with
Holgrave
as
we
find
him
on
this
particular
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
in
the
arbor
of
the
Pyncheon
garden
.
In
that
point
of
*NL*
view
,
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
to
behold
this
young
man
,
with
so
much
*NL*
faith
in
himself
,
and
so
fair
an
appearance
of
admirable
powers
,
--
so
*NL*
little
harmed
,
too
,
by
the
many
tests
that
had
tried
his
metal
,
--
it
was
*NL*
pleasant
to
see
him
in
his
kindly
intercourse
with
Phoebe
.
Her
thought
*NL*
had
scarcely
done
him
justice
when
it
pronounced
him
cold
;
or
,
if
so
,
*NL*
he
had
grown
warmer
now
.
Without
such
purpose
on
her
part
,
and
*NL*
unconsciously
on
his
,
she
made
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
like
a
*NL*
home
to
him
,
and
the
garden
a
familiar
precinct
.
With
the
insight
on
*NL*
which
he
prided
himself
,
he
fancied
that
he
could
look
through
Phoebe
,
*NL*
and
all
around
her
,
and
could
read
her
off
like
a
page
of
a
child
's
*NL*
story-book
.
But
these
transparent
natures
are
often
deceptive
in
their
*NL*
depth
;
those
pebbles
at
the
bottom
of
the
fountain
are
farther
from
us
*NL*
than
we
think
.
Thus
the
artist
,
whatever
he
might
judge
of
Phoebe
's
*NL*
capacity
,
was
beguiled
,
by
some
silent
charm
of
hers
,
to
talk
freely
of
*NL*
what
he
dreamed
of
doing
in
the
world
.
He
poured
himself
out
as
to
*NL*
another
self
.
Very
possibly
,
he
forgot
Phoebe
while
he
talked
to
her
,
*NL*
and
was
moved
only
by
the
inevitable
tendency
of
thought
,
when
rendered
*NL*
sympathetic
by
enthusiasm
and
emotion
,
to
flow
into
the
first
safe
*NL*
reservoir
which
it
finds
.
But
,
had
you
peeped
at
them
through
the
*NL*
chinks
of
the
garden-fence
,
the
young
man
's
earnestness
and
heightened
*NL*
color
might
have
led
you
to
suppose
that
he
was
making
love
to
the
*NL*
young
girl
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
something
was
said
by
Holgrave
that
made
it
apposite
for
*NL*
Phoebe
to
inquire
what
had
first
brought
him
acquainted
with
her
cousin
*NL*
Hepzibah
,
and
why
he
now
chose
to
lodge
in
the
desolate
old
Pyncheon
*NL*
House
.
Without
directly
answering
her
,
he
turned
from
the
Future
,
*NL*
which
had
heretofore
been
the
theme
of
his
discourse
,
and
began
to
*NL*
speak
of
the
influences
of
the
Past
.
One
subject
,
indeed
,
is
but
the
*NL*
reverberation
of
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
never
,
never
get
rid
of
this
Past
?
''
cried
he
,
keeping
up
the
*NL*
earnest
tone
of
his
preceding
conversation
.
``
It
lies
upon
the
Present
*NL*
like
a
giant
's
dead
body
In
fact
,
the
case
is
just
as
if
a
young
giant
*NL*
were
compelled
to
waste
all
his
strength
in
carrying
about
the
corpse
*NL*
of
the
old
giant
,
his
grandfather
,
who
died
a
long
while
ago
,
and
only
*NL*
needs
to
be
decently
buried
.
Just
think
a
moment
,
and
it
will
startle
*NL*
you
to
see
what
slaves
we
are
to
bygone
times
,
--
to
Death
,
if
we
give
*NL*
the
matter
the
right
word
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
not
see
it
,
''
observed
Phoebe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
example
,
then
,
''
continued
Holgrave
:
``
a
dead
man
,
if
he
happens
to
*NL*
have
made
a
will
,
disposes
of
wealth
no
longer
his
own
;
or
,
if
he
die
*NL*
intestate
,
it
is
distributed
in
accordance
with
the
notions
of
men
much
*NL*
longer
dead
than
he
.
A
dead
man
sits
on
all
our
judgment-seats
;
and
*NL*
living
judges
do
but
search
out
and
repeat
his
decisions
.
We
read
in
*NL*
dead
men
's
books
!
We
laugh
at
dead
men
's
jokes
,
and
cry
at
dead
men
's
*NL*
pathos
!
We
are
sick
of
dead
men
's
diseases
,
physical
and
moral
,
and
die
*NL*
of
the
same
remedies
with
which
dead
doctors
killed
their
patients
!
We
*NL*
worship
the
living
Deity
according
to
dead
men
's
forms
and
creeds
.
*NL*
Whatever
we
seek
to
do
,
of
our
own
free
motion
,
a
dead
man
's
icy
hand
*NL*
obstructs
us
!
Turn
our
eyes
to
what
point
we
may
,
a
dead
man
's
white
,
*NL*
immitigable
face
encounters
them
,
and
freezes
our
very
heart
!
And
we
*NL*
must
be
dead
ourselves
before
we
can
begin
to
have
our
proper
influence
*NL*
on
our
own
world
,
which
will
then
be
no
longer
our
world
,
but
the
world
*NL*
of
another
generation
,
with
which
we
shall
have
no
shadow
of
a
right
to
*NL*
interfere
.
I
ought
to
have
said
,
too
,
that
we
live
in
dead
men
's
*NL*
houses
;
as
,
for
instance
,
in
this
of
the
Seven
Gables
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
,
''
said
Phoebe
,
``
so
long
as
we
can
be
comfortable
in
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
shall
live
to
see
the
day
,
I
trust
,
''
went
on
the
artist
,
``
when
*NL*
no
man
shall
build
his
house
for
posterity
.
Why
should
he
?
He
might
*NL*
just
as
reasonably
order
a
durable
suit
of
clothes
,
--
leather
,
or
*NL*
guttapercha
,
or
whatever
else
lasts
longest
,
--
so
that
his
*NL*
great-grandchildren
should
have
the
benefit
of
them
,
and
cut
precisely
*NL*
the
same
figure
in
the
world
that
he
himself
does
.
If
each
generation
*NL*
were
allowed
and
expected
to
build
its
own
houses
,
that
single
change
,
*NL*
comparatively
unimportant
in
itself
,
would
imply
almost
every
reform
*NL*
which
society
is
now
suffering
for
.
I
doubt
whether
even
our
public
*NL*
edifices
--
our
capitols
,
state-houses
,
court-houses
,
city-hall
,
and
*NL*
churches
,
--
ought
to
be
built
of
such
permanent
materials
as
stone
or
*NL*
brick
.
It
were
better
that
they
should
crumble
to
ruin
once
in
twenty
*NL*
years
,
or
thereabouts
,
as
a
hint
to
the
people
to
examine
into
and
*NL*
reform
the
institutions
which
they
symbolize
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you
hate
everything
old
!
''
said
Phoebe
in
dismay
.
``
It
makes
me
*NL*
dizzy
to
think
of
such
a
shifting
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
love
nothing
mouldy
,
''
answered
Holgrave
.
``
Now
,
this
old
*NL*
Pyncheon
House
!
Is
it
a
wholesome
place
to
live
in
,
with
its
black
*NL*
shingles
,
and
the
green
moss
that
shows
how
damp
they
are
?
--
its
dark
,
*NL*
low-studded
rooms
--
its
grime
and
sordidness
,
which
are
the
*NL*
crystallization
on
its
walls
of
the
human
breath
,
that
has
been
drawn
*NL*
and
exhaled
here
in
discontent
and
anguish
?
The
house
ought
to
be
*NL*
purified
with
fire
,
--
purified
till
only
its
ashes
remain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
you
live
in
it
?
''
asked
Phoebe
,
a
little
piqued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
pursuing
my
studies
here
;
not
in
books
,
however
,
''
replied
*NL*
Holgrave
.
``
The
house
,
in
my
view
,
is
expressive
of
that
odious
and
*NL*
abominable
Past
,
with
all
its
bad
influences
,
against
which
I
have
just
*NL*
been
declaiming
.
I
dwell
in
it
for
a
while
,
that
I
may
know
the
better
*NL*
how
to
hate
it
.
By
the
bye
,
did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
Maule
,
the
*NL*
wizard
,
and
what
happened
between
him
and
your
immeasurably
*NL*
great-grandfather
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
!
''
said
Phoebe
;
``
I
heard
it
long
ago
,
from
my
father
,
and
*NL*
two
or
three
times
from
my
cousin
Hepzibah
,
in
the
month
that
I
have
*NL*
been
here
.
She
seems
to
think
that
all
the
calamities
of
the
Pyncheons
*NL*
began
from
that
quarrel
with
the
wizard
,
as
you
call
him
.
And
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
Holgrave
look
as
if
you
thought
so
too
!
How
singular
that
you
should
*NL*
believe
what
is
so
very
absurd
,
when
you
reject
many
things
that
are
a
*NL*
great
deal
worthier
of
credit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
believe
it
,
''
said
the
artist
seriously
;
``
not
as
a
superstition
,
*NL*
however
,
but
as
proved
by
unquestionable
facts
,
and
as
exemplifying
a
*NL*
theory
.
Now
,
see
:
under
those
seven
gables
,
at
which
we
now
look
*NL*
up
,
--
and
which
old
Colonel
Pyncheon
meant
to
be
the
house
of
his
*NL*
descendants
,
in
prosperity
and
happiness
,
down
to
an
epoch
far
beyond
*NL*
the
present
,
--
under
that
roof
,
through
a
portion
of
three
centuries
,
*NL*
there
has
been
perpetual
remorse
of
conscience
,
a
constantly
defeated
*NL*
hope
,
strife
amongst
kindred
,
various
misery
,
a
strange
form
of
death
,
*NL*
dark
suspicion
,
unspeakable
disgrace
,
--
all
,
or
most
of
which
calamity
I
*NL*
have
the
means
of
tracing
to
the
old
Puritan
's
inordinate
desire
to
*NL*
plant
and
endow
a
family
.
To
plant
a
family
!
This
idea
is
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
most
of
the
wrong
and
mischief
which
men
do
.
The
truth
is
,
*NL*
that
,
once
in
every
half-century
,
at
longest
,
a
family
should
be
merged
*NL*
into
the
great
,
obscure
mass
of
humanity
,
and
forget
all
about
its
*NL*
ancestors
.
Human
blood
,
in
order
to
keep
its
freshness
,
should
run
in
*NL*
hidden
streams
,
as
the
water
of
an
aqueduct
is
conveyed
in
subterranean
*NL*
pipes
.
In
the
family
existence
of
these
Pyncheons
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
--
forgive
me
Phoebe
,
but
I
can
not
think
of
you
as
one
of
*NL*
them
,
--
in
their
brief
New
England
pedigree
,
there
has
been
time
enough
*NL*
to
infect
them
all
with
one
kind
of
lunacy
or
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
very
unceremoniously
of
my
kindred
,
''
said
Phoebe
,
debating
*NL*
with
herself
whether
she
ought
to
take
offence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
speak
true
thoughts
to
a
true
mind
!
''
answered
Holgrave
,
with
a
*NL*
vehemence
which
Phoebe
had
not
before
witnessed
in
him
.
``
The
truth
is
*NL*
as
I
say
!
Furthermore
,
the
original
perpetrator
and
father
of
this
*NL*
mischief
appears
to
have
perpetuated
himself
,
and
still
walks
the
*NL*
street
,
--
at
least
,
his
very
image
,
in
mind
and
body
,
--
with
the
fairest
*NL*
prospect
of
transmitting
to
posterity
as
rich
and
as
wretched
an
*NL*
inheritance
as
he
has
received
!
Do
you
remember
the
daguerreotype
,
and
*NL*
its
resemblance
to
the
old
portrait
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strangely
in
earnest
you
are
!
''
exclaimed
Phoebe
,
looking
at
him
*NL*
with
surprise
and
perplexity
;
half
alarmed
and
partly
inclined
to
*NL*
laugh
.
``
You
talk
of
the
lunacy
of
the
Pyncheons
;
is
it
contagious
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
you
!

said
the
artist
,
coloring
and
laughing
.
``
I
believe
*NL*
I
am
a
little
mad

subject
has
taken
hold
of
my
mind
with
the

strangest
tenacity
of
clutch
since
I
have
lodged
in
yonder
old
gable
.
*NL*
As
one
method
of
throwing
it
off
,
I
have
put
an
incident
of
the
*NL*
Pyncheon
family
history
,
with
which
I
happen
to
be
acquainted
,
into
the
*NL*
form
of
a
legend

mean
to
publish
it
in
a
magazine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
write
for
the
magazines
?

inquired
Phoebe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
you
did
not
know
it
?

cried
Holgrave
.
``
Well
,
such
is
*NL*
literary
fame
!
Yes
.
Miss
Phoebe
Pyncheon
,
among
the
multitude
of
my
*NL*
marvellous
gifts
I
have
that
of
writing
stories
;
and
my
name
has
*NL*
figured
,
I
can
assure
you
,
on
the
covers
of
Graham
and
Godey
,
making
as
*NL*
respectable
an
appearance
,
for
aught
I
could
see
,
as
any
of
the
*NL*
canonized
bead-roll
with
which
it
was
associated
.
In
the
humorous
*NL*
line
,
I
am
thought
to
have
a
very
pretty
way
with
me
;
and
as
for
*NL*
pathos
,
I
am
as
provocative
of
tears
as
an
onion
.
But
shall
I
read
you
*NL*
my
story
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

if
it
is
not
very
long

said
Phoebe
,

and
added
*NL*
laughingly
,
--
``
nor
very
dull

*NL*
*NL*
As
this
latter
point
was
one
which
the
daguerreotypist
could
not
decide
*NL*
for
himself
,
he
forthwith
produced
his
roll
of
manuscript
,
and
,
while
*NL*
the
late
sunbeams
gilded
the
seven
gables

began

THERE
was
a
message
brought
,
one
day
,
from
the
worshipful
Gervayse
*NL*
Pyncheon
to
young
Matthew
Maule
,
the
carpenter
,
desiring
his
immediate
*NL*
presence
at
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
your
master
want
with
me
?
''
said
the
carpenter
to
Mr.
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
black
servant
.
``
Does
the
house
need
any
repair
?
Well
it
*NL*
may
,
by
this
time
;
and
no
blame
to
my
father
who
built
it
,
neither
!
I
*NL*
was
reading
the
old
Colonel
's
tombstone
,
no
longer
ago
than
last
*NL*
Sabbath
;
and
,
reckoning
from
that
date
,
the
house
has
stood
*NL*
seven-and-thirty
years
.
No
wonder
if
there
should
be
a
job
to
do
on
*NL*
the
roof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
what
massa
wants

answered
Scipio
.
``
The
house
is
a
berry
*NL*
good
house
,
and
old
Colonel
Pyncheon
think
so
too
,
I
reckon
;
--
else
why
*NL*
the
old
man
haunt
it
so
,
and
frighten
a
poor
nigga

As
he
does
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well

friend
Scipio
;
let
your
master
know
that
I
'm
coming

*NL*
the
carpenter
with
a
laugh
.
``
For
a
fair
,
workmanlike
job
,
he
'll
find
*NL*
me
his
man
.
And
so
the
house
is
haunted
,
is
it
?
It
will
take
a
tighter
*NL*
workman
than
I
am
to
keep
the
spirits
out
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
Even
if
*NL*
the
Colonel
would
be
quiet
,
''
he
added
,
muttering
to
himself
,
``
my
old
*NL*
grandfather
,
the
wizard
,
will
be
pretty
sure

stick
to
the
Pyncheons

as
long
as
their
walls
hold
together

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
you
mutter
to
yourself
,
Matthew
Maule
?

asked
Scipio
.
*NL*
``
And
what
for
do
you
look
so
black
at
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter

darky

said
the
carpenter
.
``
Do
you
think
nobody
is
to
*NL*
look
black
but
yourself

Go
tell
your
master
I
'm
coming

and
if
you
*NL*
happen
to
see
Mistress
Alice
,
his
daughter
,
give
Matthew
Maule
's
humble
*NL*
respects
to
her
.
She
has
brought
a
fair
face
from
Italy
,
--
fair
,
and
*NL*
gentle
,
and
proud
,
--
has
that
same
Alice
Pyncheon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
talk
of
Mistress
Alice
!
''
cried
Scipio
,
as
he
returned
from
his
*NL*
errand
.
``
The
low
carpenter-man
!
He
no
business
so
much
as
to
look
at
*NL*
her
a
great
way
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
young
Matthew
Maule
,
the
carpenter
,
it
must
be
observed
,
was
a
*NL*
person
little
understood
,
and
not
very
generally
liked
,
in
the
town
*NL*
where
he
resided
;
not
that
anything
could
be
alleged
against
his
*NL*
integrity
,
or
his
skill
and
diligence
in
the
handicraft
which
he
*NL*
exercised
.
The
aversion
-LRB-
as
it
might
justly
be
called
-RRB-
with
which
many
*NL*
persons
regarded
him
was
partly
the
result
of
his
own
character
and
*NL*
deportment
,
and
partly
an
inheritance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
the
grandson
of
a
former
Matthew
Maule
,
one
of
the
early
*NL*
settlers
of
the
town
,
and
who
had
been
a
famous
and
terrible
wizard
in
*NL*
his
day
.
This
old
reprobate
was
one
of
the
sufferers
when
Cotton
*NL*
Mather
,
and
his
brother
ministers
,
and
the
learned
judges
,
and
other
*NL*
wise
men
,
and
Sir
William
Phipps
,
the
sagacious
governor
,
made
such
*NL*
laudable
efforts
to
weaken
the
great
enemy
of
souls
,
by
sending
a
*NL*
multitude
of
his
adherents
up
the
rocky
pathway
of
Gallows
Hill
.
Since
*NL*
those
days
,
no
doubt
,
it
had
grown
to
be
suspected
that
,
in
consequence
*NL*
of
an
unfortunate
overdoing
of
a
work
praiseworthy
in
itself
,
the
*NL*
proceedings
against
the
witches
had
proved
far
less
acceptable
to
the
*NL*
Beneficent
Father
than
to
that
very
Arch
Enemy
whom
they
were
intended
*NL*
to
distress
and
utterly
overwhelm
.
It
is
not
the
less
certain
,
*NL*
however
,
that
awe
and
terror
brooded
over
the
memories
of
those
who
*NL*
died
for
this
horrible
crime
of
witchcraft
.
Their
graves
,
in
the
*NL*
crevices
of
the
rocks
,
were
supposed
to
be
incapable
of
retaining
the
*NL*
occupants
who
had
been
so
hastily
thrust
into
them
.
Old
Matthew
Maule
,
*NL*
especially
,
was
known
to
have
as
little
hesitation
or
difficulty
in
*NL*
rising
out
of
his
grave
as
an
ordinary
man
in
getting
out
of
bed
,
and
*NL*
was
as
often
seen
at
midnight
as
living
people
at
noonday
.
This
*NL*
pestilent
wizard
-LRB-
in
whom
his
just
punishment
seemed
to
have
wrought
no
*NL*
manner
of
amendment
-RRB-
had
an
inveterate
habit
of
haunting
a
certain
*NL*
mansion
,
styled
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
against
the
owner
of
*NL*
which
he
pretended
to
hold
an
unsettled
claim
for
ground-rent
.
The
*NL*
ghost
,
it
appears
,
--
with
the
pertinacity
which
was
one
of
his
*NL*
distinguishing
characteristics
while
alive
,
--
insisted
that
he
was
the
*NL*
rightful
proprietor
of
the
site
upon
which
the
house
stood
.
His
terms
*NL*
were
,
that
either
the
aforesaid
ground-rent
,
from
the
day
when
the
*NL*
cellar
began
to
be
dug
,
should
be
paid
down
,
or
the
mansion
itself
*NL*
given
up
;
else
he
,
the
ghostly
creditor
,
would
have
his
finger
in
all
*NL*
the
affairs
of
the
Pyncheons
,
and
make
everything
go
wrong
with
them
,
*NL*
though
it
should
be
a
thousand
years
after
his
death
.
It
was
a
wild
*NL*
story
,
perhaps
,
but
seemed
not
altogether
so
incredible
to
those
who
*NL*
could
remember
what
an
inflexibly
obstinate
old
fellow
this
wizard
*NL*
Maule
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
wizard
's
grandson
,
the
young
Matthew
Maule
of
our
story
,
was
*NL*
popularly
supposed
to
have
inherited
some
of
his
ancestor
's
*NL*
questionable
traits
.
It
is
wonderful
how
many
absurdities
were
*NL*
promulgated
in
reference
to
the
young
man
.
He
was
fabled
,
for
example
,
*NL*
to
have
a
strange
power
of
getting
into
people
's
dreams
,
and
regulating
*NL*
matters
there
according
to
his
own
fancy
,
pretty
much
like
the
*NL*
stage-manager
of
a
theatre
.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
among
the
*NL*
neighbors
,
particularly
the
petticoated
ones
,
about
what
they
called
*NL*
the
witchcraft
of
Maule
's
eye
.
Some
said
that
he
could
look
into
*NL*
people
's
minds
;
others
,
that
,
by
the
marvellous
power
of
this
eye
,
he
*NL*
could
draw
people
into
his
own
mind
,
or
send
them
,
if
he
pleased
,
to
do
*NL*
errands
to
his
grandfather
,
in
the
spiritual
world
;
others
,
again
,
that
*NL*
it
was
what
is
termed
an
Evil
Eye
,
and
possessed
the
valuable
faculty
*NL*
of
blighting
corn
,
and
drying
children
into
mummies
with
the
heartburn
.
*NL*
But
,
after
all
,
what
worked
most
to
the
young
carpenter
's
disadvantage
*NL*
was
,
first
,
the
reserve
and
sternness
of
his
natural
disposition
,
and
*NL*
next
,
the
fact
of
his
not
being
a
church-communicant
,
and
the
suspicion
*NL*
of
his
holding
heretical
tenets
in
matters
of
religion
and
polity
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
receiving
Mr.
Pyncheon
's
message
,
the
carpenter
merely
tarried
to
*NL*
finish
a
small
job
,
which
he
happened
to
have
in
hand
,
and
then
took
*NL*
his
way
towards
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
This
noted
edifice
,
*NL*
though
its
style
might
be
getting
a
little
out
of
fashion
,
was
still
as
*NL*
respectable
a
family
residence
as
that
of
any
gentleman
in
town
.
The
*NL*
present
owner
,
Gervayse
Pyncheon
,
was
said
to
have
contracted
a
dislike
*NL*
to
the
house
,
in
consequence
of
a
shock
to
his
sensibility
,
in
early
*NL*
childhood
,
from
the
sudden
death
of
his
grandfather
.
In
the
very
act
*NL*
of
running
to
climb
Colonel
Pyncheon
's
knee
,
the
boy
had
discovered
the
*NL*
old
Puritan
to
be
a
corpse
.
On
arriving
at
manhood
,
Mr.
Pyncheon
had
*NL*
visited
England
,
where
he
married
a
lady
of
fortune
,
and
had
*NL*
subsequently
spent
many
years
,
partly
in
the
mother
country
,
and
partly
*NL*
in
various
cities
on
the
continent
of
Europe
.
During
this
period
,
the
*NL*
family
mansion
had
been
consigned
to
the
charge
of
a
kinsman
,
who
was
*NL*
allowed
to
make
it
his
home
for
the
time
being
,
in
consideration
of
*NL*
keeping
the
premises
in
thorough
repair
.
So
faithfully
had
this
*NL*
contract
been
fulfilled
,
that
now
,
as
the
carpenter
approached
the
*NL*
house
,
his
practised
eye
could
detect
nothing
to
criticise
in
its
*NL*
condition
.
The
peaks
of
the
seven
gables
rose
up
sharply
;
the
shingled
*NL*
roof
looked
thoroughly
water-tight
;
and
the
glittering
plaster-work
*NL*
entirely
covered
the
exterior
walls
,
and
sparkled
in
the
October
sun
,
*NL*
as
if
it
had
been
new
only
a
week
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
had
that
pleasant
aspect
of
life
which
is
like
the
cheery
*NL*
expression
of
comfortable
activity
in
the
human
countenance
.
You
could
*NL*
see
,
at
once
,
that
there
was
the
stir
of
a
large
family
within
it
.
A
*NL*
huge
load
of
oak-wood
was
passing
through
the
gateway
,
towards
the
*NL*
outbuildings
in
the
rear
;
the
fat
cook
--
or
probably
it
might
be
the
*NL*
housekeeper
--
stood
at
the
side
door
,
bargaining
for
some
turkeys
and
*NL*
poultry
which
a
countryman
had
brought
for
sale
.
Now
and
then
a
*NL*
maid-servant
,
neatly
dressed
,
and
now
the
shining
sable
face
of
a
*NL*
slave
,
might
be
seen
bustling
across
the
windows
,
in
the
lower
part
of
*NL*
the
house
.
At
an
open
window
of
a
room
in
the
second
story
,
hanging
*NL*
over
some
pots
of
beautiful
and
delicate
flowers
,
--
exotics
,
but
which
*NL*
had
never
known
a
more
genial
sunshine
than
that
of
the
New
England
*NL*
autumn
,
--
was
the
figure
of
a
young
lady
,
an
exotic
,
like
the
flowers
,
*NL*
and
beautiful
and
delicate
as
they
.
Her
presence
imparted
an
*NL*
indescribable
grace
and
faint
witchery
to
the
whole
edifice
.
In
other
*NL*
respects
,
it
was
a
substantial
,
jolly-looking
mansion
,
and
seemed
fit
*NL*
to
be
the
residence
of
a
patriarch
,
who
might
establish
his
own
*NL*
headquarters
in
the
front
gable
and
assign
one
of
the
remainder
to
each
*NL*
of
his
six
children
,
while
the
great
chimney
in
the
centre
should
*NL*
symbolize
the
old
fellow
's
hospitable
heart
,
which
kept
them
all
warm
,
*NL*
and
made
a
great
whole
of
the
seven
smaller
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
vertical
sundial
on
the
front
gable
;
and
as
the
carpenter
*NL*
passed
beneath
it
,
he
looked
up
and
noted
the
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
o'clock
!
''
said
he
to
himself
.
``
My
father
told
me
that
dial
was
*NL*
put
up
only
an
hour
before
the
old
Colonel
's
death
.
How
truly
it
has
*NL*
kept
time
these
seven-and-thirty
years
past
!
The
shadow
creeps
and
*NL*
creeps
,
and
is
always
looking
over
the
shoulder
of
the
sunshine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
befitted
a
craftsman
,
like
Matthew
Maule
,
on
being
sent
*NL*
for
to
a
gentleman
's
house
,
to
go
to
the
back
door
,
where
servants
and
*NL*
work-people
were
usually
admitted
;
or
at
least
to
the
side
entrance
,
*NL*
where
the
better
class
of
tradesmen
made
application
.
But
the
*NL*
carpenter
had
a
great
deal
of
pride
and
stiffness
in
his
nature
;
and
,
*NL*
at
this
moment
,
moreover
,
his
heart
was
bitter
with
the
sense
of
*NL*
hereditary
wrong
,
because
he
considered
the
great
Pyncheon
House
to
be
*NL*
standing
on
soil
which
should
have
been
his
own
.
On
this
very
site
,
*NL*
beside
a
spring
of
delicious
water
,
his
grandfather
had
felled
the
*NL*
pine-trees
and
built
a
cottage
,
in
which
children
had
been
born
to
him
;
*NL*
and
it
was
only
from
a
dead
man
's
stiffened
fingers
that
Colonel
*NL*
Pyncheon
had
wrested
away
the
title-deeds
.
So
young
Maule
went
*NL*
straight
to
the
principal
entrance
,
beneath
a
portal
of
carved
oak
,
and
*NL*
gave
such
a
peal
of
the
iron
knocker
that
you
would
have
imagined
the
*NL*
stern
old
wizard
himself
to
be
standing
at
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Black
Scipio
answered
the
summons
in
a
prodigious
,
hurry
;
but
showed
*NL*
the
whites
of
his
eyes
in
amazement
on
beholding
only
the
carpenter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord-a-mercy
,
what
a
great
man
he
be
,
this
carpenter
fellow
!
''
mumbled
*NL*
Scipio
,
down
in
his
throat
.
``
Anybody
think
he
beat
on
the
door
with
*NL*
his
biggest
hammer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
!
''
said
Maule
sternly
.
``
Show
me
the
way
to
your
master
's
*NL*
parlor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
stept
into
the
house
,
a
note
of
sweet
and
melancholy
music
*NL*
thrilled
and
vibrated
along
the
passage-way
,
proceeding
from
one
of
the
*NL*
rooms
above
stairs
.
It
was
the
harpsichord
which
Alice
Pyncheon
had
*NL*
brought
with
her
from
beyond
the
sea
.
The
fair
Alice
bestowed
most
of
*NL*
her
maiden
leisure
between
flowers
and
music
,
although
the
former
were
*NL*
apt
to
droop
,
and
the
melodies
were
often
sad
.
She
was
of
foreign
*NL*
education
,
and
could
not
take
kindly
to
the
New
England
modes
of
life
,
*NL*
in
which
nothing
beautiful
had
ever
been
developed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Pyncheon
had
been
impatiently
awaiting
Maule
's
arrival
,
black
*NL*
Scipio
,
of
course
,
lost
no
time
in
ushering
the
carpenter
into
his
*NL*
master
's
presence
.
The
room
in
which
this
gentleman
sat
was
a
parlor
of
*NL*
moderate
size
,
looking
out
upon
the
garden
of
the
house
,
and
having
its
*NL*
windows
partly
shadowed
by
the
foliage
of
fruit-trees
.
It
was
Mr.
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
peculiar
apartment
,
and
was
provided
with
furniture
,
in
an
*NL*
elegant
and
costly
style
,
principally
from
Paris
;
the
floor
-LRB-
which
was
*NL*
unusual
at
that
day
-RRB-
being
covered
with
a
carpet
,
so
skilfully
and
*NL*
richly
wrought
that
it
seemed
to
glow
as
with
living
flowers
.
In
one
*NL*
corner
stood
a
marble
woman
,
to
whom
her
own
beauty
was
the
sole
and
*NL*
sufficient
garment
.
Some
pictures
--
that
looked
old
,
and
had
a
mellow
*NL*
tinge
diffused
through
all
their
artful
splendor
--
hung
on
the
walls
.
*NL*
Near
the
fireplace
was
a
large
and
very
beautiful
cabinet
of
ebony
,
*NL*
inlaid
with
ivory
;
a
piece
of
antique
furniture
,
which
Mr.
Pyncheon
had
*NL*
bought
in
Venice
,
and
which
he
used
as
the
treasure-place
for
medals
,
*NL*
ancient
coins
,
and
whatever
small
and
valuable
curiosities
he
had
*NL*
picked
up
on
his
travels
.
Through
all
this
variety
of
decoration
,
*NL*
however
,
the
room
showed
its
original
characteristics
;
its
low
stud
,
*NL*
its
cross-beam
,
its
chimney-piece
,
with
the
old-fashioned
Dutch
tiles
;
*NL*
so
that
it
was
the
emblem
of
a
mind
industriously
stored
with
foreign
*NL*
ideas
,
and
elaborated
into
artificial
refinement
,
but
neither
larger
,
*NL*
nor
,
in
its
proper
self
,
more
elegant
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
objects
that
appeared
rather
out
of
place
in
this
very
*NL*
handsomely
furnished
room
.
One
was
a
large
map
,
or
surveyor
's
plan
,
of
*NL*
a
tract
of
land
,
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
drawn
a
good
many
years
*NL*
ago
,
and
was
now
dingy
with
smoke
,
and
soiled
,
here
and
there
,
with
the
*NL*
touch
of
fingers
.
The
other
was
a
portrait
of
a
stern
old
man
,
in
a
*NL*
Puritan
garb
,
painted
roughly
,
but
with
a
bold
effect
,
and
a
remarkably
*NL*
strong
expression
of
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
small
table
,
before
a
fire
of
English
sea-coal
,
sat
Mr.
Pyncheon
,
*NL*
sipping
coffee
,
which
had
grown
to
be
a
very
favorite
beverage
with
him
*NL*
in
France
.
He
was
a
middle-aged
and
really
handsome
man
,
with
a
wig
*NL*
flowing
down
upon
his
shoulders
;
his
coat
was
of
blue
velvet
,
with
lace
*NL*
on
the
borders
and
at
the
button-holes
;
and
the
firelight
glistened
on
*NL*
the
spacious
breadth
of
his
waistcoat
,
which
was
flowered
all
over
with
*NL*
gold
.
On
the
entrance
of
Scipio
,
ushering
in
the
carpenter
,
Mr.
*NL*
Pyncheon
turned
partly
round
,
but
resumed
his
former
position
,
and
*NL*
proceeded
deliberately
to
finish
his
cup
of
coffee
,
without
immediate
*NL*
notice
of
the
guest
whom
he
had
summoned
to
his
presence
.
It
was
not
*NL*
that
he
intended
any
rudeness
or
improper
neglect
,
--
which
,
indeed
,
he
*NL*
would
have
blushed
to
be
guilty
of
,
--
but
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
*NL*
a
person
in
Maule
's
station
had
a
claim
on
his
courtesy
,
or
would
*NL*
trouble
himself
about
it
one
way
or
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carpenter
,
however
,
stepped
at
once
to
the
hearth
,
and
turned
*NL*
himself
about
,
so
as
to
look
Mr.
Pyncheon
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sent
for
me
,
''
said
he
.
``
Be
pleased
to
explain
your
business
,
that
*NL*
I
may
go
back
to
my
own
affairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
excuse
me
,
''
said
Mr.
Pyncheon
quietly
.
``
I
did
not
mean
to
tax
*NL*
your
time
without
a
recompense
.
Your
name
,
I
think
,
is
Maule
,
--
Thomas
*NL*
or
Matthew
Maule
,
--
a
son
or
grandson
of
the
builder
of
this
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
Maule
,
''
replied
the
carpenter
,
--
``
son
of
him
who
built
the
*NL*
house
,
--
grandson
of
the
rightful
proprietor
of
the
soil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
the
dispute
to
which
you
allude
,
''
observed
Mr.
Pyncheon
with
*NL*
undisturbed
equanimity
.
``
I
am
well
aware
that
my
grandfather
was
*NL*
compelled
to
resort
to
a
suit
at
law
,
in
order
to
establish
his
claim
*NL*
to
the
foundation-site
of
this
edifice
.
We
will
not
,
if
you
please
,
*NL*
renew
the
discussion
.
The
matter
was
settled
at
the
time
,
and
by
the
*NL*
competent
authorities
,
--
equitably
,
it
is
to
be
presumed
,
--
and
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
irrevocably
.
Yet
,
singularly
enough
,
there
is
an
incidental
*NL*
reference
to
this
very
subject
in
what
I
am
now
about
to
say
to
you
.
*NL*
And
this
same
inveterate
grudge
,
--
excuse
me
,
I
mean
no
offence
,
--
this
*NL*
irritability
,
which
you
have
just
shown
,
is
not
entirely
aside
from
the
*NL*
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
can
find
anything
for
your
purpose
,
Mr.
Pyncheon
,
''
said
the
*NL*
carpenter
,
``
in
a
man
's
natural
resentment
for
the
wrongs
done
to
his
*NL*
blood
,
you
are
welcome
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
you
at
your
word
,
Goodman
Maule
,
''
said
the
owner
of
the
Seven
*NL*
Gables
,
with
a
smile
,
``
and
will
proceed
to
suggest
a
mode
in
which
your
*NL*
hereditary
resentments
--
justifiable
or
otherwise
--
may
have
had
a
*NL*
bearing
on
my
affairs
.
You
have
heard
,
I
suppose
,
that
the
Pyncheon
*NL*
family
,
ever
since
my
grandfather
's
days
,
have
been
prosecuting
a
still
*NL*
unsettled
claim
to
a
very
large
extent
of
territory
at
the
Eastward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Often
,
''
replied
Maule
,
--
and
it
is
said
that
a
smile
came
over
his
*NL*
face
,
--
``
very
often
,
--
from
my
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
claim
,
''
continued
Mr.
Pyncheon
,
after
pausing
a
moment
,
as
if
to
*NL*
consider
what
the
carpenter
's
smile
might
mean
,
``
appeared
to
be
on
the
*NL*
very
verge
of
a
settlement
and
full
allowance
,
at
the
period
of
my
*NL*
grandfather
's
decease
.
It
was
well
known
,
to
those
in
his
confidence
,
*NL*
that
he
anticipated
neither
difficulty
nor
delay
.
Now
,
Colonel
*NL*
Pyncheon
,
I
need
hardly
say
,
was
a
practical
man
,
well
acquainted
with
*NL*
public
and
private
business
,
and
not
at
all
the
person
to
cherish
*NL*
ill-founded
hopes
,
or
to
attempt
the
following
out
of
an
impracticable
*NL*
scheme
.
It
is
obvious
to
conclude
,
therefore
,
that
he
had
grounds
,
not
*NL*
apparent
to
his
heirs
,
for
his
confident
anticipation
of
success
in
the
*NL*
matter
of
this
Eastern
claim
.
In
a
word
,
I
believe
,
--
and
my
legal
*NL*
advisers
coincide
in
the
belief
,
which
,
moreover
,
is
authorized
,
to
a
*NL*
certain
extent
,
by
the
family
traditions
,
--
that
my
grandfather
was
in
*NL*
possession
of
some
deed
,
or
other
document
,
essential
to
this
claim
,
*NL*
but
which
has
since
disappeared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
''
said
Matthew
Maule
,
--
and
again
,
it
is
said
,
there
was
a
*NL*
dark
smile
on
his
face
,
--
``
but
what
can
a
poor
carpenter
have
to
do
with
*NL*
the
grand
affairs
of
the
Pyncheon
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
nothing
,
''
returned
Mr.
Pyncheon
,
``
possibly
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
ensued
a
great
many
words
between
Matthew
Maule
and
the
proprietor
*NL*
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
on
the
subject
which
the
latter
had
thus
broached
.
*NL*
It
seems
-LRB-
although
Mr.
Pyncheon
had
some
hesitation
in
referring
to
*NL*
stories
so
exceedingly
absurd
in
their
aspect
-RRB-
that
the
popular
belief
*NL*
pointed
to
some
mysterious
connection
and
dependence
,
existing
between
*NL*
the
family
of
the
Maules
and
these
vast
unrealized
possessions
of
the
*NL*
Pyncheons
.
It
was
an
ordinary
saying
that
the
old
wizard
,
hanged
*NL*
though
he
was
,
had
obtained
the
best
end
of
the
bargain
in
his
contest
*NL*
with
Colonel
Pyncheon
;
inasmuch
as
he
had
got
possession
of
the
great
*NL*
Eastern
claim
,
in
exchange
for
an
acre
or
two
of
garden-ground
.
A
very
*NL*
aged
woman
,
recently
dead
,
had
often
used
the
metaphorical
expression
,
*NL*
in
her
fireside
talk
,
that
miles
and
miles
of
the
Pyncheon
lands
had
*NL*
been
shovelled
into
Maule
's
grave
;
which
,
by
the
bye
,
was
but
a
very
*NL*
shallow
nook
,
between
two
rocks
,
near
the
summit
of
Gallows
Hill
.
*NL*
Again
,
when
the
lawyers
were
making
inquiry
for
the
missing
document
,
*NL*
it
was
a
by-word
that
it
would
never
be
found
,
unless
in
the
wizard
's
*NL*
skeleton
hand
.
So
much
weight
had
the
shrewd
lawyers
assigned
to
these
*NL*
fables
,
that
-LRB-
but
Mr.
Pyncheon
did
not
see
fit
to
inform
the
carpenter
*NL*
of
the
fact
-RRB-
they
had
secretly
caused
the
wizard
's
grave
to
be
*NL*
searched
.
Nothing
was
discovered
,
however
,
except
that
,
unaccountably
,
*NL*
the
right
hand
of
the
skeleton
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
what
was
unquestionably
important
,
a
portion
of
these
popular
*NL*
rumors
could
be
traced
,
though
rather
doubtfully
and
indistinctly
,
to
*NL*
chance
words
and
obscure
hints
of
the
executed
wizard
's
son
,
and
the
*NL*
father
of
this
present
Matthew
Maule
.
And
here
Mr.
Pyncheon
could
*NL*
bring
an
item
of
his
own
personal
evidence
into
play
.
Though
but
a
*NL*
child
at
the
time
,
he
either
remembered
or
fancied
that
Matthew
's
*NL*
father
had
had
some
job
to
perform
on
the
day
before
,
or
possibly
the
*NL*
very
morning
of
the
Colonel
's
decease
,
in
the
private
room
where
he
and
*NL*
the
carpenter
were
at
this
moment
talking
.
Certain
papers
belonging
to
*NL*
Colonel
Pyncheon
,
as
his
grandson
distinctly
recollected
,
had
been
*NL*
spread
out
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
Maule
understood
the
insinuated
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
,
''
he
said
,
--
but
still
there
was
that
dark
smile
,
making
a
*NL*
riddle
of
his
countenance
,
--
``
my
father
was
an
honester
man
than
the
*NL*
bloody
old
Colonel
!
Not
to
get
his
rights
back
again
would
he
have
*NL*
carried
off
one
of
those
papers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
bandy
words
with
you
,
''
observed
the
foreign-bred
Mr.
*NL*
Pyncheon
,
with
haughty
composure
.
``
Nor
will
it
become
me
to
resent
any
*NL*
rudeness
towards
either
my
grandfather
or
myself
.
A
gentleman
,
before
*NL*
seeking
intercourse
with
a
person
of
your
station
and
habits
,
will
*NL*
first
consider
whether
the
urgency
of
the
end
may
compensate
for
the
*NL*
disagreeableness
of
the
means
.
It
does
so
in
the
present
instance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
renewed
the
conversation
,
and
made
great
pecuniary
offers
to
*NL*
the
carpenter
,
in
case
the
latter
should
give
information
leading
to
*NL*
the
discovery
of
the
lost
document
,
and
the
consequent
success
of
the
*NL*
Eastern
claim
.
For
a
long
time
Matthew
Maule
is
said
to
have
turned
a
*NL*
cold
ear
to
these
propositions
.
At
last
,
however
,
with
a
strange
kind
*NL*
of
laugh
,
he
inquired
whether
Mr.
Pyncheon
would
make
over
to
him
the
*NL*
old
wizard
's
homestead-ground
,
together
with
the
House
of
the
Seven
*NL*
Gables
,
now
standing
on
it
,
in
requital
of
the
documentary
evidence
so
*NL*
urgently
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wild
,
chimney-corner
legend
-LRB-
which
,
without
copying
all
its
*NL*
extravagances
,
my
narrative
essentially
follows
-RRB-
here
gives
an
account
*NL*
of
some
very
strange
behavior
on
the
part
of
Colonel
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
portrait
.
This
picture
,
it
must
be
understood
,
was
supposed
to
be
so
*NL*
intimately
connected
with
the
fate
of
the
house
,
and
so
magically
built
*NL*
into
its
walls
,
that
,
if
once
it
should
be
removed
,
that
very
instant
*NL*
the
whole
edifice
would
come
thundering
down
in
a
heap
of
dusty
ruin
.
*NL*
All
through
the
foregoing
conversation
between
Mr.
Pyncheon
and
the
*NL*
carpenter
,
the
portrait
had
been
frowning
,
clenching
its
fist
,
and
*NL*
giving
many
such
proofs
of
excessive
discomposure
,
but
without
*NL*
attracting
the
notice
of
either
of
the
two
colloquists
.
And
finally
,
*NL*
at
Matthew
Maule
's
audacious
suggestion
of
a
transfer
of
the
*NL*
seven-gabled
structure
,
the
ghostly
portrait
is
averred
to
have
lost
*NL*
all
patience
,
and
to
have
shown
itself
on
the
point
of
descending
*NL*
bodily
from
its
frame
.
But
such
incredible
incidents
are
merely
to
be
*NL*
mentioned
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
up
this
house
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Pyncheon
,
in
amazement
at
the
*NL*
proposal
.
``
Were
I
to
do
so
,
my
grandfather
would
not
rest
quiet
in
his
*NL*
grave
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
has
,
if
all
stories
are
true
,
''
remarked
the
carpenter
*NL*
composedly
.
``
But
that
matter
concerns
his
grandson
more
than
it
does
*NL*
Matthew
Maule
.
I
have
no
other
terms
to
propose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Impossible
as
he
at
first
thought
it
to
comply
with
Maule
's
conditions
,
*NL*
still
,
on
a
second
glance
,
Mr.
Pyncheon
was
of
opinion
that
they
might
*NL*
at
least
be
made
matter
of
discussion
.
He
himself
had
no
personal
*NL*
attachment
for
the
house
,
nor
any
pleasant
associations
connected
with
*NL*
his
childish
residence
in
it
.
On
the
contrary
,
after
seven-and-thirty
*NL*
years
,
the
presence
of
his
dead
grandfather
seemed
still
to
pervade
it
,
*NL*
as
on
that
morning
when
the
affrighted
boy
had
beheld
him
,
with
so
*NL*
ghastly
an
aspect
,
stiffening
in
his
chair
.
His
long
abode
in
foreign
*NL*
parts
,
moreover
,
and
familiarity
with
many
of
the
castles
and
ancestral
*NL*
halls
of
England
,
and
the
marble
palaces
of
Italy
,
had
caused
him
to
*NL*
look
contemptuously
at
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
whether
in
point
*NL*
of
splendor
or
convenience
.
It
was
a
mansion
exceedingly
inadequate
to
*NL*
the
style
of
living
which
it
would
be
incumbent
on
Mr.
Pyncheon
to
*NL*
support
,
after
realizing
his
territorial
rights
.
His
steward
might
*NL*
deign
to
occupy
it
,
but
never
,
certainly
,
the
great
landed
proprietor
*NL*
himself
.
In
the
event
of
success
,
indeed
,
it
was
his
purpose
to
return
*NL*
to
England
;
nor
,
to
say
the
truth
,
would
he
recently
have
quitted
that
*NL*
more
congenial
home
,
had
not
his
own
fortune
,
as
well
as
his
deceased
*NL*
wife
's
,
begun
to
give
symptoms
of
exhaustion
.
The
Eastern
claim
once
*NL*
fairly
settled
,
and
put
upon
the
firm
basis
of
actual
possession
,
Mr.
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
property
--
to
be
measured
by
miles
,
not
acres
--
would
be
worth
*NL*
an
earldom
,
and
would
reasonably
entitle
him
to
solicit
,
or
enable
him
*NL*
to
purchase
,
that
elevated
dignity
from
the
British
monarch
.
Lord
*NL*
Pyncheon
!
--
or
the
Earl
of
Waldo
!
--
how
could
such
a
magnate
be
expected
*NL*
to
contract
his
grandeur
within
the
pitiful
compass
of
seven
shingled
*NL*
gables
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
on
an
enlarged
view
of
the
business
,
the
carpenter
's
terms
*NL*
appeared
so
ridiculously
easy
that
Mr.
Pyncheon
could
scarcely
forbear
*NL*
laughing
in
his
face
.
He
was
quite
ashamed
,
after
the
foregoing
*NL*
reflections
,
to
propose
any
diminution
of
so
moderate
a
recompense
for
*NL*
the
immense
service
to
be
rendered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consent
to
your
proposition
,
Maule
!
''
cried
he
.
``
Put
me
in
possession
*NL*
of
the
document
essential
to
establish
my
rights
,
and
the
House
of
the
*NL*
Seven
Gables
is
your
own
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
some
versions
of
the
story
,
a
regular
contract
to
the
*NL*
above
effect
was
drawn
up
by
a
lawyer
,
and
signed
and
sealed
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
witnesses
.
Others
say
that
Matthew
Maule
was
contented
*NL*
with
a
private
written
agreement
,
in
which
Mr.
Pyncheon
pledged
his
*NL*
honor
and
integrity
to
the
fulfillment
of
the
terms
concluded
upon
.
*NL*
The
gentleman
then
ordered
wine
,
which
he
and
the
carpenter
drank
*NL*
together
,
in
confirmation
of
their
bargain
.
During
the
whole
preceding
*NL*
discussion
and
subsequent
formalities
,
the
old
Puritan
's
portrait
seems
*NL*
to
have
persisted
in
its
shadowy
gestures
of
disapproval
;
but
without
*NL*
effect
,
except
that
,
as
Mr.
Pyncheon
set
down
the
emptied
glass
,
he
*NL*
thought
he
beheld
his
grandfather
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
sherry
is
too
potent
a
wine
for
me
;
it
has
affected
my
brain
*NL*
already
,
''
he
observed
,
after
a
somewhat
startled
look
at
the
picture
.
*NL*
``
On
returning
to
Europe
,
I
shall
confine
myself
to
the
more
delicate
*NL*
vintages
of
Italy
and
France
,
the
best
of
which
will
not
bear
*NL*
transportation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord
Pyncheon
may
drink
what
wine
he
will
,
and
wherever
he
*NL*
pleases
,
''
replied
the
carpenter
,
as
if
he
had
been
privy
to
Mr.
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
ambitious
projects
.
``
But
first
,
sir
,
if
you
desire
tidings
*NL*
of
this
lost
document
,
I
must
crave
the
favor
of
a
little
talk
with
*NL*
your
fair
daughter
Alice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mad
,
Maule
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Pyncheon
haughtily
;
and
now
,
at
*NL*
last
,
there
was
anger
mixed
up
with
his
pride
.
``
What
can
my
daughter
*NL*
have
to
do
with
a
business
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
at
this
new
demand
on
the
carpenter
's
part
,
the
proprietor
of
*NL*
the
Seven
Gables
was
even
more
thunder-struck
than
at
the
cool
*NL*
proposition
to
surrender
his
house
.
There
was
,
at
least
,
an
assignable
*NL*
motive
for
the
first
stipulation
;
there
appeared
to
be
none
whatever
*NL*
for
the
last
.
Nevertheless
,
Matthew
Maule
sturdily
insisted
on
the
*NL*
young
lady
being
summoned
,
and
even
gave
her
father
to
understand
,
in
a
*NL*
mysterious
kind
of
explanation
,
--
which
made
the
matter
considerably
*NL*
darker
than
it
looked
before
,
--
that
the
only
chance
of
acquiring
the
*NL*
requisite
knowledge
was
through
the
clear
,
crystal
medium
of
a
pure
and
*NL*
virgin
intelligence
,
like
that
of
the
fair
Alice
.
Not
to
encumber
our
*NL*
story
with
Mr.
Pyncheon
's
scruples
,
whether
of
conscience
,
pride
,
or
*NL*
fatherly
affection
,
he
at
length
ordered
his
daughter
to
be
called
.
He
*NL*
well
knew
that
she
was
in
her
chamber
,
and
engaged
in
no
occupation
*NL*
that
could
not
readily
be
laid
aside
;
for
,
as
it
happened
,
ever
since
*NL*
Alice
's
name
had
been
spoken
,
both
her
father
and
the
carpenter
had
*NL*
heard
the
sad
and
sweet
music
of
her
harpsichord
,
and
the
airier
*NL*
melancholy
of
her
accompanying
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Alice
Pyncheon
was
summoned
,
and
appeared
.
A
portrait
of
this
young
*NL*
lady
,
painted
by
a
Venetian
artist
,
and
left
by
her
father
in
England
,
*NL*
is
said
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
present
Duke
of
*NL*
Devonshire
,
and
to
be
now
preserved
at
Chatsworth
;
not
on
account
of
*NL*
any
associations
with
the
original
,
but
for
its
value
as
a
picture
,
and
*NL*
the
high
character
of
beauty
in
the
countenance
.
If
ever
there
was
a
*NL*
lady
born
,
and
set
apart
from
the
world
's
vulgar
mass
by
a
certain
*NL*
gentle
and
cold
stateliness
,
it
was
this
very
Alice
Pyncheon
.
Yet
*NL*
there
was
the
womanly
mixture
in
her
;
the
tenderness
,
or
,
at
least
,
the
*NL*
tender
capabilities
.
For
the
sake
of
that
redeeming
quality
,
a
man
of
*NL*
generous
nature
would
have
forgiven
all
her
pride
,
and
have
been
*NL*
content
,
almost
,
to
lie
down
in
her
path
,
and
let
Alice
set
her
slender
*NL*
foot
upon
his
heart
.
All
that
he
would
have
required
was
simply
the
*NL*
acknowledgment
that
he
was
indeed
a
man
,
and
a
fellow-being
,
moulded
of
*NL*
the
same
elements
as
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Alice
came
into
the
room
,
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
carpenter
,
who
was
*NL*
standing
near
its
centre
,
clad
in
green
woollen
jacket
,
a
pair
of
loose
*NL*
breeches
,
open
at
the
knees
,
and
with
a
long
pocket
for
his
rule
,
the
*NL*
end
of
which
protruded
;
it
was
as
proper
a
mark
of
the
artisan
's
*NL*
calling
as
Mr.
Pyncheon
's
full-dress
sword
of
that
gentleman
's
*NL*
aristocratic
pretensions
.
A
glow
of
artistic
approval
brightened
over
*NL*
Alice
Pyncheon
's
face
;
she
was
struck
with
admiration
--
which
she
made
*NL*
no
attempt
to
conceal
--
of
the
remarkable
comeliness
,
strength
,
and
*NL*
energy
of
Maule
's
figure
.
But
that
admiring
glance
-LRB-
which
most
other
*NL*
men
,
perhaps
,
would
have
cherished
as
a
sweet
recollection
all
through
*NL*
life
-RRB-
the
carpenter
never
forgave
.
It
must
have
been
the
devil
himself
*NL*
that
made
Maule
so
subtile
in
his
preception
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
the
girl
look
at
me
as
if
I
were
a
brute
beast
?
''
thought
he
,
*NL*
setting
his
teeth
.
``
She
shall
know
whether
I
have
a
human
spirit
;
and
*NL*
the
worse
for
her
,
if
it
prove
stronger
than
her
own
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
,
you
sent
for
me
,
''
said
Alice
,
in
her
sweet
and
harp-like
*NL*
voice
.
``
But
,
if
you
have
business
with
this
young
man
,
pray
let
me
go
*NL*
again
.
You
know
I
do
not
love
this
room
,
in
spite
of
that
Claude
,
with
*NL*
which
you
try
to
bring
back
sunny
recollections
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
a
moment
,
young
lady
,
if
you
please
!
''
said
Matthew
Maule
.
``
My
*NL*
business
with
your
father
is
over
.
With
yourself
,
it
is
now
to
begin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
looked
towards
her
father
,
in
surprise
and
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Alice
,
''
said
Mr.
Pyncheon
,
with
some
disturbance
and
confusion
.
*NL*
``
This
young
man
--
his
name
is
Matthew
Maule
--
professes
,
so
far
as
I
can
*NL*
understand
him
,
to
be
able
to
discover
,
through
your
means
,
a
certain
*NL*
paper
or
parchment
,
which
was
missing
long
before
your
birth
.
The
*NL*
importance
of
the
document
in
question
renders
it
advisable
to
neglect
*NL*
no
possible
,
even
if
improbable
,
method
of
regaining
it
.
You
will
*NL*
therefore
oblige
me
,
my
dear
Alice
,
by
answering
this
person
's
*NL*
inquiries
,
and
complying
with
his
lawful
and
reasonable
requests
,
so
*NL*
far
as
they
may
appear
to
have
the
aforesaid
object
in
view
.
As
I
*NL*
shall
remain
in
the
room
,
you
need
apprehend
no
rude
nor
unbecoming
*NL*
deportment
,
on
the
young
man
's
part
;
and
,
at
your
slightest
wish
,
of
*NL*
course
,
the
investigation
,
or
whatever
we
may
call
it
,
shall
*NL*
immediately
be
broken
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mistress
Alice
Pyncheon
,
''
remarked
Matthew
Maule
,
with
the
utmost
*NL*
deference
,
but
yet
a
half-hidden
sarcasm
in
his
look
and
tone
,
``
will
no
*NL*
doubt
feel
herself
quite
safe
in
her
father
's
presence
,
and
under
his
*NL*
all-sufficient
protection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
shall
entertain
no
manner
of
apprehension
,
with
my
father
*NL*
at
hand
,
''
said
Alice
with
maidenly
dignity
.
``
Neither
do
I
conceive
*NL*
that
a
lady
,
while
true
to
herself
,
can
have
aught
to
fear
from
*NL*
whomsoever
,
or
in
any
circumstances
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Alice
!
By
what
unhappy
impulse
did
she
thus
put
herself
at
once
on
*NL*
terms
of
defiance
against
a
strength
which
she
could
not
estimate
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Mistress
Alice
,
''
said
Matthew
Maule
,
handing
a
*NL*
chair
,
--
gracefully
enough
,
for
a
craftsman
,
``
will
it
please
you
only
to
*NL*
sit
down
,
and
do
me
the
favor
-LRB-
though
altogether
beyond
a
poor
*NL*
carpenter
's
deserts
-RRB-
to
fix
your
eyes
on
mine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
complied
,
She
was
very
proud
.
Setting
aside
all
advantages
of
*NL*
rank
,
this
fair
girl
deemed
herself
conscious
of
a
power
--
combined
of
*NL*
beauty
,
high
,
unsullied
purity
,
and
the
preservative
force
of
*NL*
womanhood
--
that
could
make
her
sphere
impenetrable
,
unless
betrayed
by
*NL*
treachery
within
.
She
instinctively
knew
,
it
may
be
,
that
some
*NL*
sinister
or
evil
potency
was
now
striving
to
pass
her
barriers
;
nor
*NL*
would
she
decline
the
contest
.
So
Alice
put
woman
's
might
against
*NL*
man
's
might
;
a
match
not
often
equal
on
the
part
of
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
meanwhile
had
turned
away
,
and
seemed
absorbed
in
the
*NL*
contemplation
of
a
landscape
by
Claude
,
where
a
shadowy
and
*NL*
sun-streaked
vista
penetrated
so
remotely
into
an
ancient
wood
,
that
it
*NL*
would
have
been
no
wonder
if
his
fancy
had
lost
itself
in
the
picture
's
*NL*
bewildering
depths
.
But
,
in
truth
,
the
picture
was
no
more
to
him
at
*NL*
that
moment
than
the
blank
wall
against
which
it
hung
.
His
mind
was
*NL*
haunted
with
the
many
and
strange
tales
which
he
had
heard
,
attributing
*NL*
mysterious
if
not
supernatural
endowments
to
these
Maules
,
as
well
the
*NL*
grandson
here
present
as
his
two
immediate
ancestors
.
Mr.
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
long
residence
abroad
,
and
intercourse
with
men
of
wit
and
*NL*
fashion
,
--
courtiers
,
worldings
,
and
free-thinkers
,
--
had
done
much
*NL*
towards
obliterating
the
grim
Puritan
superstitions
,
which
no
man
of
*NL*
New
England
birth
at
that
early
period
could
entirely
escape
.
But
,
on
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
had
not
a
whole
community
believed
Maule
's
grandfather
*NL*
to
be
a
wizard
?
Had
not
the
crime
been
proved
?
Had
not
the
wizard
died
*NL*
for
it
?
Had
he
not
bequeathed
a
legacy
of
hatred
against
the
Pyncheons
*NL*
to
this
only
grandson
,
who
,
as
it
appeared
,
was
now
about
to
exercise
a
*NL*
subtle
influence
over
the
daughter
of
his
enemy
's
house
?
Might
not
*NL*
this
influence
be
the
same
that
was
called
witchcraft
?
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
half
around
,
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
Maule
's
figure
in
the
*NL*
looking-glass
.
At
some
paces
from
Alice
,
with
his
arms
uplifted
in
the
*NL*
air
,
the
carpenter
made
a
gesture
as
if
directing
downward
a
slow
,
*NL*
ponderous
,
and
invisible
weight
upon
the
maiden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
Maule
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Pyncheon
,
stepping
forward
.
``
I
forbid
*NL*
your
proceeding
further
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
my
dear
father
,
do
not
interrupt
the
young
man
,
''
said
Alice
,
*NL*
without
changing
her
position
.
``
His
efforts
,
I
assure
you
,
will
prove
*NL*
very
harmless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Mr.
Pyncheon
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
Claude
.
It
was
then
his
*NL*
daughter
's
will
,
in
opposition
to
his
own
,
that
the
experiment
should
*NL*
be
fully
tried
.
Henceforth
,
therefore
,
he
did
but
consent
,
not
urge
*NL*
it
.
And
was
it
not
for
her
sake
far
more
than
for
his
own
that
he
*NL*
desired
its
success
?
That
lost
parchment
once
restored
,
the
beautiful
*NL*
Alice
Pyncheon
,
with
the
rich
dowry
which
he
could
then
bestow
,
might
*NL*
wed
an
English
duke
or
a
German
reigning-prince
,
instead
of
some
New
*NL*
England
clergyman
or
lawyer
!
At
the
thought
,
the
ambitious
father
*NL*
almost
consented
,
in
his
heart
,
that
,
if
the
devil
's
power
were
needed
*NL*
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
great
object
,
Maule
might
evoke
him
.
*NL*
Alice
's
own
purity
would
be
her
safeguard
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
his
mind
full
of
imaginary
magnificence
,
Mr.
Pyncheon
heard
a
*NL*
half-uttered
exclamation
from
his
daughter
.
It
was
very
faint
and
low
;
*NL*
so
indistinct
that
there
seemed
but
half
a
will
to
shape
out
the
words
,
*NL*
and
too
undefined
a
purport
to
be
intelligible
.
Yet
it
was
a
call
for
*NL*
help
!
--
his
conscience
never
doubted
it
;
--
and
,
little
more
than
a
*NL*
whisper
to
his
ear
,
it
was
a
dismal
shriek
,
and
long
reechoed
so
,
in
*NL*
the
region
round
his
heart
!
But
this
time
the
father
did
not
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
further
interval
,
Maule
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behold
your
daughter
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pyncheon
came
hastily
forward
.
The
carpenter
was
standing
erect
in
*NL*
front
of
Alice
's
chair
,
and
pointing
his
finger
towards
the
maiden
with
*NL*
an
expression
of
triumphant
power
,
the
limits
of
which
could
not
be
*NL*
defined
,
as
,
indeed
,
its
scope
stretched
vaguely
towards
the
unseen
and
*NL*
the
infinite
.
Alice
sat
in
an
attitude
of
profound
repose
,
with
the
*NL*
long
brown
lashes
drooping
over
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
she
is
!
''
said
the
carpenter
.
``
Speak
to
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alice
!
My
daughter
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Pyncheon
.
``
My
own
Alice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Louder
!
''
said
Maule
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alice
!
Awake
!
''
cried
her
father
.
``
It
troubles
me
to
see
you
thus
!
*NL*
Awake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
loudly
,
with
terror
in
his
voice
,
and
close
to
that
delicate
*NL*
ear
which
had
always
been
so
sensitive
to
every
discord
.
But
the
sound
*NL*
evidently
reached
her
not
.
It
is
indescribable
what
a
sense
of
remote
,
*NL*
dim
,
unattainable
distance
betwixt
himself
and
Alice
was
impressed
on
*NL*
the
father
by
this
impossibility
of
reaching
her
with
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Best
touch
her
!
''
said
Matthew
Maule
``
Shake
the
girl
,
and
roughly
,
too
!
*NL*
My
hands
are
hardened
with
too
much
use
of
axe
,
saw
,
and
plane
,
--
else
I
*NL*
might
help
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pyncheon
took
her
hand
,
and
pressed
it
with
the
earnestness
of
*NL*
startled
emotion
.
He
kissed
her
,
with
so
great
a
heart-throb
in
the
*NL*
kiss
,
that
he
thought
she
must
needs
feel
it
.
Then
,
in
a
gust
of
anger
*NL*
at
her
insensibility
,
he
shook
her
maiden
form
with
a
violence
which
,
*NL*
the
next
moment
,
it
affrighted
him
to
remember
.
He
withdrew
his
*NL*
encircling
arms
,
and
Alice
--
whose
figure
,
though
flexible
,
had
been
*NL*
wholly
impassive
--
relapsed
into
the
same
attitude
as
before
these
*NL*
attempts
to
arouse
her
.
Maule
having
shifted
his
position
,
her
face
*NL*
was
turned
towards
him
slightly
,
but
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
reference
*NL*
of
her
very
slumber
to
his
guidance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
was
a
strange
sight
to
behold
how
the
man
of
conventionalities
*NL*
shook
the
powder
out
of
his
periwig
;
how
the
reserved
and
stately
*NL*
gentleman
forgot
his
dignity
;
how
the
gold-embroidered
waistcoat
*NL*
flickered
and
glistened
in
the
firelight
with
the
convulsion
of
rage
,
*NL*
terror
,
and
sorrow
in
the
human
heart
that
was
beating
under
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Villain
!
''
cried
Mr.
Pyncheon
,
shaking
his
clenched
fist
at
Maule
.
*NL*
``
You
and
the
fiend
together
have
robbed
me
of
my
daughter
.
Give
her
*NL*
back
,
spawn
of
the
old
wizard
,
or
you
shall
climb
Gallows
Hill
in
your
*NL*
grandfather
's
footsteps
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Softly
,
Mr.
Pyncheon
!
''
said
the
carpenter
with
scornful
composure
.
*NL*
``
Softly
,
an
'
it
please
your
worship
,
else
you
will
spoil
those
rich
*NL*
lace-ruffles
at
your
wrists
!
Is
it
my
crime
if
you
have
sold
your
*NL*
daughter
for
the
mere
hope
of
getting
a
sheet
of
yellow
parchment
into
*NL*
your
clutch
?
There
sits
Mistress
Alice
quietly
asleep
.
Now
let
Matthew
*NL*
Maule
try
whether
she
be
as
proud
as
the
carpenter
found
her
awhile
*NL*
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
,
and
Alice
responded
,
with
a
soft
,
subdued
,
inward
*NL*
acquiescence
,
and
a
bending
of
her
form
towards
him
,
like
the
flame
of
*NL*
a
torch
when
it
indicates
a
gentle
draught
of
air
.
He
beckoned
with
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
,
rising
from
her
chair
,
--
blindly
,
but
undoubtingly
,
as
*NL*
tending
to
her
sure
and
inevitable
centre
,
--
the
proud
Alice
approached
*NL*
him
.
He
waved
her
back
,
and
,
retreating
,
Alice
sank
again
into
her
*NL*
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
mine
!
''
said
Matthew
Maule
.
``
Mine
,
by
the
right
of
the
*NL*
strongest
spirit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
further
progress
of
the
legend
,
there
is
a
long
,
grotesque
,
and
*NL*
occasionally
awe-striking
account
of
the
carpenter
's
incantations
-LRB-
if
*NL*
so
they
are
to
be
called
-RRB-
,
with
a
view
of
discovering
the
lost
*NL*
document
.
It
appears
to
have
been
his
object
to
convert
the
mind
of
*NL*
Alice
into
a
kind
of
telescopic
medium
,
through
which
Mr.
Pyncheon
and
*NL*
himself
might
obtain
a
glimpse
into
the
spiritual
world
.
He
succeeded
,
*NL*
accordingly
,
in
holding
an
imperfect
sort
of
intercourse
,
at
one
*NL*
remove
,
with
the
departed
personages
in
whose
custody
the
so
much
*NL*
valued
secret
had
been
carried
beyond
the
precincts
of
earth
.
During
*NL*
her
trance
,
Alice
described
three
figures
as
being
present
to
her
*NL*
spiritualized
perception
.
One
was
an
aged
,
dignified
,
stern-looking
*NL*
gentleman
,
clad
as
for
a
solemn
festival
in
grave
and
costly
attire
,
*NL*
but
with
a
great
blood-stain
on
his
richly
wrought
band
;
the
second
,
an
*NL*
aged
man
,
meanly
dressed
,
with
a
dark
and
malign
countenance
,
and
a
*NL*
broken
halter
about
his
neck
;
the
third
,
a
person
not
so
advanced
in
*NL*
life
as
the
former
two
,
but
beyond
the
middle
age
,
wearing
a
coarse
*NL*
woollen
tunic
and
leather
breeches
,
and
with
a
carpenter
's
rule
*NL*
sticking
out
of
his
side
pocket
.
These
three
visionary
characters
*NL*
possessed
a
mutual
knowledge
of
the
missing
document
.
One
of
them
,
in
*NL*
truth
,
--
it
was
he
with
the
blood-stain
on
his
band
,
--
seemed
,
unless
his
*NL*
gestures
were
misunderstood
,
to
hold
the
parchment
in
his
immediate
*NL*
keeping
,
but
was
prevented
by
his
two
partners
in
the
mystery
from
*NL*
disburdening
himself
of
the
trust
.
Finally
,
when
he
showed
a
purpose
*NL*
of
shouting
forth
the
secret
loudly
enough
to
be
heard
from
his
own
*NL*
sphere
into
that
of
mortals
,
his
companions
struggled
with
him
,
and
*NL*
pressed
their
hands
over
his
mouth
;
and
forthwith
--
whether
that
he
were
*NL*
choked
by
it
,
or
that
the
secret
itself
was
of
a
crimson
hue
--
there
was
*NL*
a
fresh
flow
of
blood
upon
his
band
.
Upon
this
,
the
two
meanly
dressed
*NL*
figures
mocked
and
jeered
at
the
much-abashed
old
dignitary
,
and
*NL*
pointed
their
fingers
at
the
stain
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
juncture
,
Maule
turned
to
Mr.
Pyncheon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
never
be
allowed
,
''
said
he
.
``
The
custody
of
this
secret
,
that
*NL*
would
so
enrich
his
heirs
,
makes
part
of
your
grandfather
's
*NL*
retribution
.
He
must
choke
with
it
until
it
is
no
longer
of
any
value
.
*NL*
And
keep
you
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
!
It
is
too
dear
bought
an
*NL*
inheritance
,
and
too
heavy
with
the
curse
upon
it
,
to
be
shifted
yet
*NL*
awhile
from
the
Colonel
's
posterity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pyncheon
tried
to
speak
,
but
--
what
with
fear
and
passion
--
could
*NL*
make
only
a
gurgling
murmur
in
his
throat
.
The
carpenter
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
,
worshipful
sir
!
--
so
you
have
old
Maule
's
blood
to
drink
!
''
said
he
*NL*
jeeringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fiend
in
man
's
shape
!
why
dost
thou
keep
dominion
over
my
child
?
''
*NL*
cried
Mr.
Pyncheon
,
when
his
choked
utterance
could
make
way
.
``
Give
me
*NL*
back
my
daughter
.
Then
go
thy
ways
;
and
may
we
never
meet
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
daughter
!
''
said
Matthew
Maule
.
``
Why
,
she
is
fairly
mine
!
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
not
to
be
too
hard
with
fair
Mistress
Alice
,
I
will
leave
*NL*
her
in
your
keeping
;
but
I
do
not
warrant
you
that
she
shall
never
have
*NL*
occasion
to
remember
Maule
,
the
carpenter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waved
his
hands
with
an
upward
motion
;
and
,
after
a
few
repetitions
*NL*
of
similar
gestures
,
the
beautiful
Alice
Pyncheon
awoke
from
her
*NL*
strange
trance
.
She
awoke
without
the
slightest
recollection
of
her
*NL*
visionary
experience
;
but
as
one
losing
herself
in
a
momentary
reverie
,
*NL*
and
returning
to
the
consciousness
of
actual
life
,
in
almost
as
brief
*NL*
an
interval
as
the
down-sinking
flame
of
the
hearth
should
quiver
again
*NL*
up
the
chimney
.
On
recognizing
Matthew
Maule
,
she
assumed
an
air
of
*NL*
somewhat
cold
but
gentle
dignity
,
the
rather
,
as
there
was
a
certain
*NL*
peculiar
smile
on
the
carpenter
's
visage
that
stirred
the
native
pride
*NL*
of
the
fair
Alice
.
So
ended
,
for
that
time
,
the
quest
for
the
lost
*NL*
title-deed
of
the
Pyncheon
territory
at
the
Eastward
;
nor
,
though
often
*NL*
subsequently
renewed
,
has
it
ever
yet
befallen
a
Pyncheon
to
set
his
*NL*
eye
upon
that
parchment
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
alas
for
the
beautiful
,
the
gentle
,
yet
too
haughty
Alice
!
A
*NL*
power
that
she
little
dreamed
of
had
laid
its
grasp
upon
her
maiden
*NL*
soul
.
A
will
,
most
unlike
her
own
,
constrained
her
to
do
its
grotesque
*NL*
and
fantastic
bidding
.
Her
father
as
it
proved
,
had
martyred
his
poor
*NL*
child
to
an
inordinate
desire
for
measuring
his
land
by
miles
instead
*NL*
of
acres
.
And
,
therefore
,
while
Alice
Pyncheon
lived
,
she
was
Maule
's
*NL*
slave
,
in
a
bondage
more
humiliating
,
a
thousand-fold
,
than
that
which
*NL*
binds
its
chain
around
the
body
.
Seated
by
his
humble
fireside
,
Maule
*NL*
had
but
to
wave
his
hand
;
and
,
wherever
the
proud
lady
chanced
to
*NL*
be
,
--
whether
in
her
chamber
,
or
entertaining
her
father
's
stately
*NL*
guests
,
or
worshipping
at
church
,
--
whatever
her
place
or
occupation
,
*NL*
her
spirit
passed
from
beneath
her
own
control
,
and
bowed
itself
to
*NL*
Maule
.
``
Alice
,
laugh
!
''
--
the
carpenter
,
beside
his
hearth
,
would
say
;
*NL*
or
perhaps
intensely
will
it
,
without
a
spoken
word
.
And
,
even
were
it
*NL*
prayer-time
,
or
at
a
funeral
,
Alice
must
break
into
wild
laughter
.
*NL*
``
Alice
,
be
sad
!
''
--
and
,
at
the
instant
,
down
would
come
her
tears
,
*NL*
quenching
all
the
mirth
of
those
around
her
like
sudden
rain
upon
a
*NL*
bonfire
.
``
Alice
,
dance
.
''
--
and
dance
she
would
,
not
in
such
court-like
*NL*
measures
as
she
had
learned
abroad
,
but
some
high-paced
jig
,
or
*NL*
hop-skip
rigadoon
,
befitting
the
brisk
lasses
at
a
rustic
merry-making
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
be
Maule
's
impulse
,
not
to
ruin
Alice
,
nor
to
visit
her
*NL*
with
any
black
or
gigantic
mischief
,
which
would
have
crowned
her
*NL*
sorrows
with
the
grace
of
tragedy
,
but
to
wreak
a
low
,
ungenerous
scorn
*NL*
upon
her
.
Thus
all
the
dignity
of
life
was
lost
.
She
felt
herself
too
*NL*
much
abased
,
and
longed
to
change
natures
with
some
worm
!
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
at
a
bridal
party
-LRB-
but
not
her
own
;
for
,
so
lost
from
*NL*
self-control
,
she
would
have
deemed
it
sin
to
marry
-RRB-
,
poor
Alice
was
*NL*
beckoned
forth
by
her
unseen
despot
,
and
constrained
,
in
her
gossamer
*NL*
white
dress
and
satin
slippers
,
to
hasten
along
the
street
to
the
mean
*NL*
dwelling
of
a
laboring-man
.
There
was
laughter
and
good
cheer
within
;
*NL*
for
Matthew
Maule
,
that
night
,
was
to
wed
the
laborer
's
daughter
,
and
*NL*
had
summoned
proud
Alice
Pyncheon
to
wait
upon
his
bride
.
And
so
she
*NL*
did
;
and
when
the
twain
were
one
,
Alice
awoke
out
of
her
enchanted
*NL*
sleep
.
Yet
,
no
longer
proud
,
--
humbly
,
and
with
a
smile
all
steeped
in
*NL*
sadness
,
--
she
kissed
Maule
's
wife
,
and
went
her
way
.
It
was
an
*NL*
inclement
night
;
the
southeast
wind
drove
the
mingled
snow
and
rain
*NL*
into
her
thinly
sheltered
bosom
;
her
satin
slippers
were
wet
through
*NL*
and
through
,
as
she
trod
the
muddy
sidewalks
.
The
next
day
a
cold
;
*NL*
soon
,
a
settled
cough
;
anon
,
a
hectic
cheek
,
a
wasted
form
,
that
sat
*NL*
beside
the
harpsichord
,
and
filled
the
house
with
music
!
Music
in
*NL*
which
a
strain
of
the
heavenly
choristers
was
echoed
!
Oh
;
joy
!
For
*NL*
Alice
had
borne
her
last
humiliation
!
Oh
,
greater
joy
!
For
Alice
was
*NL*
penitent
of
her
one
earthly
sin
,
and
proud
no
more
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
Pyncheons
made
a
great
funeral
for
Alice
.
The
kith
and
kin
were
*NL*
there
,
and
the
whole
respectability
of
the
town
besides
.
But
,
last
in
*NL*
the
procession
,
came
Matthew
Maule
,
gnashing
his
teeth
,
as
if
he
would
*NL*
have
bitten
his
own
heart
in
twain
,
--
the
darkest
and
wofullest
man
that
*NL*
ever
walked
behind
a
corpse
!
He
meant
to
humble
Alice
,
not
to
kill
her
;
*NL*
but
he
had
taken
a
woman
's
delicate
soul
into
his
rude
gripe
,
to
play
*NL*
with
--
and
she
was
dead
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XIV
Phoebe
's
Good-Bye
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HOLGRAVE
,
plunging
into
his
tale
with
the
energy
and
absorption
natural
*NL*
to
a
young
author
,
had
given
a
good
deal
of
action
to
the
parts
capable
*NL*
of
being
developed
and
exemplified
in
that
manner
.
He
now
observed
*NL*
that
a
certain
remarkable
drowsiness
-LRB-
wholly
unlike
that
with
which
the
*NL*
reader
possibly
feels
himself
affected
-RRB-
had
been
flung
over
the
senses
*NL*
of
his
auditress
.
It
was
the
effect
,
unquestionably
,
of
the
mystic
*NL*
gesticulations
by
which
he
had
sought
to
bring
bodily
before
Phoebe
's
*NL*
perception
the
figure
of
the
mesmerizing
carpenter
.
With
the
lids
*NL*
drooping
over
her
eyes
,
--
now
lifted
for
an
instant
,
and
drawn
down
*NL*
again
as
with
leaden
weights
,
--
she
leaned
slightly
towards
him
,
and
*NL*
seemed
almost
to
regulate
her
breath
by
his
.
Holgrave
gazed
at
her
,
as
*NL*
he
rolled
up
his
manuscript
,
and
recognized
an
incipient
stage
of
that
*NL*
curious
psychological
condition
which
,
as
he
had
himself
told
Phoebe
,
*NL*
he
possessed
more
than
an
ordinary
faculty
of
producing
.
A
veil
was
*NL*
beginning
to
be
muffled
about
her
,
in
which
she
could
behold
only
him
,
*NL*
and
live
only
in
his
thoughts
and
emotions
.
His
glance
,
as
he
fastened
*NL*
it
on
the
young
girl
,
grew
involuntarily
more
concentrated
;
in
his
*NL*
attitude
there
was
the
consciousness
of
power
,
investing
his
hardly
*NL*
mature
figure
with
a
dignity
that
did
not
belong
to
its
physical
*NL*
manifestation
.
It
was
evident
,
that
,
with
but
one
wave
of
his
hand
and
*NL*
a
corresponding
effort
of
his
will
,
he
could
complete
his
mastery
over
*NL*
Phoebe
's
yet
free
and
virgin
spirit
:
he
could
establish
an
influence
*NL*
over
this
good
,
pure
,
and
simple
child
,
as
dangerous
,
and
perhaps
as
*NL*
disastrous
,
as
that
which
the
carpenter
of
his
legend
had
acquired
and
*NL*
exercised
over
the
ill-fated
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
a
disposition
like
Holgrave
's
,
at
once
speculative
and
active
,
there
*NL*
is
no
temptation
so
great
as
the
opportunity
of
acquiring
empire
over
*NL*
the
human
spirit
;
nor
any
idea
more
seductive
to
a
young
man
than
to
*NL*
become
the
arbiter
of
a
young
girl
's
destiny
.
Let
us
,
*NL*
therefore
,
--
whatever
his
defects
of
nature
and
education
,
and
in
spite
*NL*
of
his
scorn
for
creeds
and
institutions
,
--
concede
to
the
*NL*
daguerreotypist
the
rare
and
high
quality
of
reverence
for
another
's
*NL*
individuality
.
Let
us
allow
him
integrity
,
also
,
forever
after
to
be
*NL*
confided
in
;
since
he
forbade
himself
to
twine
that
one
link
more
which
*NL*
might
have
rendered
his
spell
over
Phoebe
indissoluble
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
slight
gesture
upward
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
really
mortify
me
,
my
dear
Miss
Phoebe
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
smiling
*NL*
half-sarcastically
at
her
.
``
My
poor
story
,
it
is
but
too
evident
,
will
*NL*
never
do
for
Godey
or
Graham
!
Only
think
of
your
falling
asleep
at
what
*NL*
I
hoped
the
newspaper
critics
would
pronounce
a
most
brilliant
,
*NL*
powerful
,
imaginative
,
pathetic
,
and
original
winding
up
!
Well
,
the
*NL*
manuscript
must
serve
to
light
lamps
with
;
--
if
,
indeed
,
being
so
imbued
*NL*
with
my
gentle
dulness
,
it
is
any
longer
capable
of
flame
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
asleep
!
How
can
you
say
so
?
''
answered
Phoebe
,
as
unconscious
of
the
*NL*
crisis
through
which
she
had
passed
as
an
infant
of
the
precipice
to
*NL*
the
verge
of
which
it
has
rolled
.
``
No
,
no
!
I
consider
myself
as
having
*NL*
been
very
attentive
;
and
,
though
I
do
n't
remember
the
incidents
quite
*NL*
distinctly
,
yet
I
have
an
impression
of
a
vast
deal
of
trouble
and
*NL*
calamity
,
--
so
,
no
doubt
,
the
story
will
prove
exceedingly
attractive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
sun
had
gone
down
,
and
was
tinting
the
clouds
towards
*NL*
the
zenith
with
those
bright
hues
which
are
not
seen
there
until
some
*NL*
time
after
sunset
,
and
when
the
horizon
has
quite
lost
its
richer
*NL*
brilliancy
.
The
moon
,
too
,
which
had
long
been
climbing
overhead
,
and
*NL*
unobtrusively
melting
its
disk
into
the
azure
,
--
like
an
ambitious
*NL*
demagogue
,
who
hides
his
aspiring
purpose
by
assuming
the
prevalent
hue
*NL*
of
popular
sentiment
,
--
now
began
to
shine
out
,
broad
and
oval
,
in
its
*NL*
middle
pathway
.
These
silvery
beams
were
already
powerful
enough
to
*NL*
change
the
character
of
the
lingering
daylight
.
They
softened
and
*NL*
embellished
the
aspect
of
the
old
house
;
although
the
shadows
fell
*NL*
deeper
into
the
angles
of
its
many
gables
,
and
lay
brooding
under
the
*NL*
projecting
story
,
and
within
the
half-open
door
.
With
the
lapse
of
*NL*
every
moment
,
the
garden
grew
more
picturesque
;
the
fruit-trees
,
*NL*
shrubbery
,
and
flower-bushes
had
a
dark
obscurity
among
them
.
The
*NL*
commonplace
characteristics
--
which
,
at
noontide
,
it
seemed
to
have
*NL*
taken
a
century
of
sordid
life
to
accumulate
--
were
now
transfigured
by
*NL*
a
charm
of
romance
.
A
hundred
mysterious
years
were
whispering
among
*NL*
the
leaves
,
whenever
the
slight
sea-breeze
found
its
way
thither
and
*NL*
stirred
them
.
Through
the
foliage
that
roofed
the
little
summer-house
*NL*
the
moonlight
flickered
to
and
fro
,
and
fell
silvery
white
on
the
dark
*NL*
floor
,
the
table
,
and
the
circular
bench
,
with
a
continual
shift
and
*NL*
play
,
according
as
the
chinks
and
wayward
crevices
among
the
twigs
*NL*
admitted
or
shut
out
the
glimmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
sweetly
cool
was
the
atmosphere
,
after
all
the
feverish
day
,
that
*NL*
the
summer
eve
might
be
fancied
as
sprinkling
dews
and
liquid
*NL*
moonlight
,
with
a
dash
of
icy
temper
in
them
,
out
of
a
silver
vase
.
*NL*
Here
and
there
,
a
few
drops
of
this
freshness
were
scattered
on
a
human
*NL*
heart
,
and
gave
it
youth
again
,
and
sympathy
with
the
eternal
youth
of
*NL*
nature
.
The
artist
chanced
to
be
one
on
whom
the
reviving
influence
*NL*
fell
.
It
made
him
feel
--
what
he
sometimes
almost
forgot
,
thrust
so
*NL*
early
as
he
had
been
into
the
rude
struggle
of
man
with
man
--
how
*NL*
youthful
he
still
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
''
he
observed
,
``
that
I
never
watched
the
coming
of
so
*NL*
beautiful
an
eve
,
and
never
felt
anything
so
very
much
like
happiness
*NL*
as
at
this
moment
.
After
all
,
what
a
good
world
we
live
in
!
How
good
,
*NL*
and
beautiful
!
How
young
it
is
,
too
,
with
nothing
really
rotten
or
*NL*
age-worn
in
it
!
This
old
house
,
for
example
,
which
sometimes
has
*NL*
positively
oppressed
my
breath
with
its
smell
of
decaying
timber
!
And
*NL*
this
garden
,
where
the
black
mould
always
clings
to
my
spade
,
as
if
I
*NL*
were
a
sexton
delving
in
a
graveyard
!
Could
I
keep
the
feeling
that
now
*NL*
possesses
me
,
the
garden
would
every
day
be
virgin
soil
,
with
the
*NL*
earth
's
first
freshness
in
the
flavor
of
its
beans
and
squashes
;
and
*NL*
the
house
!
--
it
would
be
like
a
bower
in
Eden
,
blossoming
with
the
*NL*
earliest
roses
that
God
ever
made
.
Moonlight
,
and
the
sentiment
in
*NL*
man
's
heart
responsive
to
it
,
are
the
greatest
of
renovators
and
*NL*
reformers
.
And
all
other
reform
and
renovation
,
I
suppose
,
will
prove
*NL*
to
be
no
better
than
moonshine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
happier
than
I
am
now
;
at
least
,
much
gayer
,
''
said
Phoebe
*NL*
thoughtfully
.
``
Yet
I
am
sensible
of
a
great
charm
in
this
brightening
*NL*
moonlight
;
and
I
love
to
watch
how
the
day
,
tired
as
it
is
,
lags
away
*NL*
reluctantly
,
and
hates
to
be
called
yesterday
so
soon
.
I
never
cared
*NL*
much
about
moonlight
before
.
What
is
there
,
I
wonder
,
so
beautiful
in
*NL*
it
,
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
never
felt
it
before
?
''
inquired
the
artist
,
looking
*NL*
earnestly
at
the
girl
through
the
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
answered
Phoebe
;
``
and
life
does
not
look
the
same
,
now
that
I
*NL*
have
felt
it
so
.
It
seems
as
if
I
had
looked
at
everything
,
hitherto
,
*NL*
in
broad
daylight
,
or
else
in
the
ruddy
light
of
a
cheerful
fire
,
*NL*
glimmering
and
dancing
through
a
room
.
Ah
,
poor
me
!
''
she
added
,
with
a
*NL*
half-melancholy
laugh
.
``
I
shall
never
be
so
merry
as
before
I
knew
*NL*
Cousin
Hepzibah
and
poor
Cousin
Clifford
.
I
have
grown
a
great
deal
*NL*
older
,
in
this
little
time
.
Older
,
and
,
I
hope
,
wiser
,
and
,
--
not
*NL*
exactly
sadder
,
--
but
,
certainly
,
with
not
half
so
much
lightness
in
my
*NL*
spirits
!
I
have
given
them
my
sunshine
,
and
have
been
glad
to
give
it
;
*NL*
but
,
of
course
,
I
can
not
both
give
and
keep
it
.
They
are
welcome
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
lost
nothing
,
Phoebe
,
worth
keeping
,
nor
which
it
was
*NL*
possible
to
keep
,
''
said
Holgrave
after
a
pause
.
``
Our
first
youth
is
of
*NL*
no
value
;
for
we
are
never
conscious
of
it
until
after
it
is
gone
.
But
*NL*
sometimes
--
always
,
I
suspect
,
unless
one
is
exceedingly
*NL*
unfortunate
--
there
comes
a
sense
of
second
youth
,
gushing
out
of
the
*NL*
heart
's
joy
at
being
in
love
;
or
,
possibly
,
it
may
come
to
crown
some
*NL*
other
grand
festival
in
life
,
if
any
other
such
there
be
.
This
*NL*
bemoaning
of
one
's
self
-LRB-
as
you
do
now
-RRB-
over
the
first
,
careless
,
*NL*
shallow
gayety
of
youth
departed
,
and
this
profound
happiness
at
youth
*NL*
regained
,
--
so
much
deeper
and
richer
than
that
we
lost
,
--
are
essential
*NL*
to
the
soul
's
development
.
In
some
cases
,
the
two
states
come
almost
*NL*
simultaneously
,
and
mingle
the
sadness
and
the
rapture
in
one
*NL*
mysterious
emotion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
think
I
understand
you
,
''
said
Phoebe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
wonder
,
''
replied
Holgrave
,
smiling
;
``
for
I
have
told
you
a
secret
*NL*
which
I
hardly
began
to
know
before
I
found
myself
giving
it
utterance
.
*NL*
Remember
it
,
however
;
and
when
the
truth
becomes
clear
to
you
,
then
*NL*
think
of
this
moonlight
scene
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
entirely
moonlight
now
,
except
only
a
little
flush
of
faint
*NL*
crimson
,
upward
from
the
west
,
between
those
buildings
,
''
remarked
*NL*
Phoebe
.
``
I
must
go
in
.
Cousin
Hepzibah
is
not
quick
at
figures
,
and
*NL*
will
give
herself
a
headache
over
the
day
's
accounts
,
unless
I
help
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Holgrave
detained
her
a
little
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Hepzibah
tells
me
,
''
observed
he
,
``
that
you
return
to
the
country
*NL*
in
a
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
only
for
a
little
while
,
''
answered
Phoebe
;
``
for
I
look
upon
*NL*
this
as
my
present
home
.
I
go
to
make
a
few
arrangements
,
and
to
take
*NL*
a
more
deliberate
leave
of
my
mother
and
friends
.
It
is
pleasant
to
*NL*
live
where
one
is
much
desired
and
very
useful
;
and
I
think
I
may
have
*NL*
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
myself
so
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
surely
may
,
and
more
than
you
imagine
,
''
said
the
artist
.
*NL*
``
Whatever
health
,
comfort
,
and
natural
life
exists
in
the
house
is
*NL*
embodied
in
your
person
.
These
blessings
came
along
with
you
,
and
will
*NL*
vanish
when
you
leave
the
threshold
.
Miss
Hepzibah
,
by
secluding
*NL*
herself
from
society
,
has
lost
all
true
relation
with
it
,
and
is
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
dead
;
although
she
galvanizes
herself
into
a
semblance
of
life
,
*NL*
and
stands
behind
her
counter
,
afflicting
the
world
with
a
*NL*
greatly-to-be-deprecated
scowl
.
Your
poor
cousin
Clifford
is
another
*NL*
dead
and
long-buried
person
,
on
whom
the
governor
and
council
have
*NL*
wrought
a
necromantic
miracle
.
I
should
not
wonder
if
he
were
to
*NL*
crumble
away
,
some
morning
,
after
you
are
gone
,
and
nothing
be
seen
of
*NL*
him
more
,
except
a
heap
of
dust
.
Miss
Hepzibah
,
at
any
rate
,
will
lose
*NL*
what
little
flexibility
she
has
.
They
both
exist
by
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
think
so
,
''
answered
Phoebe
gravely
.
``
But
it
*NL*
is
true
that
my
small
abilities
were
precisely
what
they
needed
;
and
I
*NL*
have
a
real
interest
in
their
welfare
,
--
an
odd
kind
of
motherly
*NL*
sentiment
,
--
which
I
wish
you
would
not
laugh
at
!
And
let
me
tell
you
*NL*
frankly
,
Mr.
Holgrave
,
I
am
sometimes
puzzled
to
know
whether
you
wish
*NL*
them
well
or
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
,
''
said
the
daguerreotypist
,
``
I
do
feel
an
interest
in
this
*NL*
antiquated
,
poverty-stricken
old
maiden
lady
,
and
this
degraded
and
*NL*
shattered
gentleman
,
--
this
abortive
lover
of
the
beautiful
.
A
kindly
*NL*
interest
,
too
,
helpless
old
children
that
they
are
!
But
you
have
no
*NL*
conception
what
a
different
kind
of
heart
mine
is
from
your
own
.
It
is
*NL*
not
my
impulse
,
as
regards
these
two
individuals
,
either
to
help
or
*NL*
hinder
;
but
to
look
on
,
to
analyze
,
to
explain
matters
to
myself
,
and
*NL*
to
comprehend
the
drama
which
,
for
almost
two
hundred
years
,
has
been
*NL*
dragging
its
slow
length
over
the
ground
where
you
and
I
now
tread
.
If
*NL*
permitted
to
witness
the
close
,
I
doubt
not
to
derive
a
moral
*NL*
satisfaction
from
it
,
go
matters
how
they
may
.
There
is
a
conviction
*NL*
within
me
that
the
end
draws
nigh
.
But
,
though
Providence
sent
you
*NL*
hither
to
help
,
and
sends
me
only
as
a
privileged
and
meet
spectator
,
I
*NL*
pledge
myself
to
lend
these
unfortunate
beings
whatever
aid
I
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
speak
more
plainly
,
''
cried
Phoebe
,
perplexed
and
*NL*
displeased
;
``
and
,
above
all
,
that
you
would
feel
more
like
a
Christian
*NL*
and
a
human
being
!
How
is
it
possible
to
see
people
in
distress
without
*NL*
desiring
,
more
than
anything
else
,
to
help
and
comfort
them
?
You
talk
*NL*
as
if
this
old
house
were
a
theatre
;
and
you
seem
to
look
at
Hepzibah
's
*NL*
and
Clifford
's
misfortunes
,
and
those
of
generations
before
them
,
as
a
*NL*
tragedy
,
such
as
I
have
seen
acted
in
the
hall
of
a
country
hotel
,
only
*NL*
the
present
one
appears
to
be
played
exclusively
for
your
amusement
.
I
*NL*
do
not
like
this
.
The
play
costs
the
performers
too
much
,
and
the
*NL*
audience
is
too
cold-hearted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
severe
,
''
said
Holgrave
,
compelled
to
recognize
a
degree
of
*NL*
truth
in
the
piquant
sketch
of
his
own
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
''
continued
Phoebe
,
``
what
can
you
mean
by
your
conviction
,
*NL*
which
you
tell
me
of
,
that
the
end
is
drawing
near
?
Do
you
know
of
any
*NL*
new
trouble
hanging
over
my
poor
relatives
?
If
so
,
tell
me
at
once
,
and
*NL*
I
will
not
leave
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
Phoebe
!
''
said
the
daguerreotypist
,
holding
out
his
hand
,
*NL*
to
which
the
girl
was
constrained
to
yield
her
own
.
``
I
am
somewhat
of
*NL*
a
mystic
,
it
must
be
confessed
.
The
tendency
is
in
my
blood
,
together
*NL*
with
the
faculty
of
mesmerism
,
which
might
have
brought
me
to
Gallows
*NL*
Hill
,
in
the
good
old
times
of
witchcraft
.
Believe
me
,
if
I
were
*NL*
really
aware
of
any
secret
,
the
disclosure
of
which
would
benefit
your
*NL*
friends
,
--
who
are
my
own
friends
,
likewise
,
--
you
should
learn
it
before
*NL*
we
part
.
But
I
have
no
such
knowledge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hold
something
back
!
''
said
Phoebe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
--
no
secrets
but
my
own
,
''
answered
Holgrave
.
``
I
can
perceive
,
*NL*
indeed
,
that
Judge
Pyncheon
still
keeps
his
eye
on
Clifford
,
in
whose
*NL*
ruin
he
had
so
large
a
share
.
His
motives
and
intentions
,
however
are
*NL*
a
mystery
to
me
.
He
is
a
determined
and
relentless
man
,
with
the
*NL*
genuine
character
of
an
inquisitor
;
and
had
he
any
object
to
gain
by
*NL*
putting
Clifford
to
the
rack
,
I
verily
believe
that
he
would
wrench
his
*NL*
joints
from
their
sockets
,
in
order
to
accomplish
it
.
But
,
so
wealthy
*NL*
and
eminent
as
he
is
,
--
so
powerful
in
his
own
strength
,
and
in
the
*NL*
support
of
society
on
all
sides
,
--
what
can
Judge
Pyncheon
have
to
hope
*NL*
or
fear
from
the
imbecile
,
branded
,
half-torpid
Clifford
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
''
urged
Phoebe
,
``
you
did
speak
as
if
misfortune
were
impending
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
was
because
I
am
morbid
!
''
replied
the
artist
.
``
My
mind
has
a
*NL*
twist
aside
,
like
almost
everybody
's
mind
,
except
your
own
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
it
is
so
strange
to
find
myself
an
inmate
of
this
old
Pyncheon
House
,
*NL*
and
sitting
in
this
old
garden
--
-LRB-
hark
,
how
Maule
's
well
is
*NL*
murmuring
!
-RRB-
--
that
,
were
it
only
for
this
one
circumstance
,
I
can
not
*NL*
help
fancying
that
Destiny
is
arranging
its
fifth
act
for
a
*NL*
catastrophe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
cried
Phoebe
with
renewed
vexation
;
for
she
was
by
nature
as
*NL*
hostile
to
mystery
as
the
sunshine
to
a
dark
corner
.
``
You
puzzle
me
*NL*
more
than
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
us
part
friends
!

said
Holgrave
,
pressing
her
hand
.
``
Or
,
if
*NL*
not
friends
,
let
us
part
before
you
entirely
hate
me
.
You
,
who
love
*NL*
everybody
else
in
the
world

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
then
,
''
said
Phoebe
frankly
.
``
I
do
not
mean
to
be
angry
a
*NL*
great
while

should
be
sorry
to
have
you
think
so
.
There
has
*NL*
Cousin
Hepzibah
been
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
,
this
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
past
!
She
thinks
I
stay
too
long
in
the
damp
garden
.
*NL*
So
,
good-night
,
and
good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
second
morning
thereafter
,
Phoebe
might
have
been
seen
,
in
her
*NL*
straw
bonnet
,
with
a
shawl
on
one
arm
and
a
little
carpet-bag
on
the
*NL*
other
,
bidding
adieu
to
Hepzibah
and
Cousin
Clifford
.
She
was
to
take
*NL*
a
seat
in
the
next
train
of
cars
,
which
would
transport
her
to
within
*NL*
half
a
dozen
miles
of
her
country
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
were
in
Phoebe
's
eyes
;
a
smile
,
dewy
with
affectionate
*NL*
regret
,
was
glimmering
around
her
pleasant
mouth
.
She
wondered
how
it
*NL*
came
to
pass
,
that
her
life
of
a
few
weeks
,
here
in
this
heavy-hearted
*NL*
old
mansion
,
had
taken
such
hold
of
her
,
and
so
melted
into
her
*NL*
associations
,
as
now
to
seem
a
more
important
centre-point
of
*NL*
remembrance
than
all
which
had
gone
before
.
How
had
Hepzibah
--
grim
,
*NL*
silent
,
and
irresponsive
to
her
overflow
of
cordial
sentiment
--
contrived
*NL*
to
win
so
much
love
?
And
Clifford
,
--
in
his
abortive
decay
,
with
the
*NL*
mystery
of
fearful
crime
upon
him
,
and
the
close
prison-atmosphere
yet
*NL*
lurking
in
his
breath
,
--
how
had
he
transformed
himself
into
the
simplest
*NL*
child
,
whom
Phoebe
felt
bound
to
watch
over
,
and
be
,
as
it
were
,
the
*NL*
providence
of
his
unconsidered
hours
!
Everything
,
at
that
instant
of
*NL*
farewell
,
stood
out
prominently
to
her
view
.
Look
where
she
would
,
lay
*NL*
her
hand
on
what
she
might
,
the
object
responded
to
her
consciousness
,
*NL*
as
if
a
moist
human
heart
were
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
peeped
from
the
window
into
the
garden
,
and
felt
herself
more
*NL*
regretful
at
leaving
this
spot
of
black
earth
,
vitiated
with
such
an
*NL*
age-long
growth
of
weeds
,
than
joyful
at
the
idea
of
again
scenting
her
*NL*
pine
forests
and
fresh
clover-fields
.
She
called
Chanticleer
,
his
two
*NL*
wives
,
and
the
venerable
chicken
,
and
threw
them
some
crumbs
of
bread
*NL*
from
the
breakfast-table
.
These
being
hastily
gobbled
up
,
the
chicken
*NL*
spread
its
wings
,
and
alighted
close
by
Phoebe
on
the
window-sill
,
*NL*
where
it
looked
gravely
into
her
face
and
vented
its
emotions
in
a
*NL*
croak
.
Phoebe
bade
it
be
a
good
old
chicken
during
her
absence
,
and
*NL*
promised
to
bring
it
a
little
bag
of
buckwheat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Phoebe
!
''
remarked
Hepzibah
,
``
you
do
not
smile
so
naturally
as
when
*NL*
you
came
to
us
!
Then
,
the
smile
chose
to
shine
out
;
now
,
you
choose
it
*NL*
should
.
It
is
well
that
you
are
going
back
,
for
a
little
while
,
into
*NL*
your
native
air
.
There
has
been
too
much
weight
on
your
spirits
.
The
*NL*
house
is
too
gloomy
and
lonesome
;
the
shop
is
full
of
vexations
;
and
as
*NL*
for
me
,
I
have
no
faculty
of
making
things
look
brighter
than
they
are
.
*NL*
Dear
Clifford
has
been
your
only
comfort
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
hither
,
Phoebe
,
''
suddenly
cried
her
cousin
Clifford
,
who
had
said
*NL*
very
little
all
the
morning
.
``
Close
!
--
closer
!
--
and
look
me
in
the
*NL*
face
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebe
put
one
of
her
small
hands
on
each
elbow
of
his
chair
,
and
*NL*
leaned
her
face
towards
him
,
so
that
he
might
peruse
it
as
carefully
as
*NL*
he
would
.
It
is
probable
that
the
latent
emotions
of
this
parting
hour
*NL*
had
revived
,
in
some
degree
,
his
bedimmed
and
enfeebled
faculties
.
At
*NL*
any
rate
,
Phoebe
soon
felt
that
,
if
not
the
profound
insight
of
a
seer
,
*NL*
yet
a
more
than
feminine
delicacy
of
appreciation
,
was
making
her
heart
*NL*
the
subject
of
its
regard
.
A
moment
before
,
she
had
known
nothing
*NL*
which
she
would
have
sought
to
hide
.
Now
,
as
if
some
secret
were
*NL*
hinted
to
her
own
consciousness
through
the
medium
of
another
's
*NL*
perception
,
she
was
fain
to
let
her
eyelids
droop
beneath
Clifford
's
*NL*
gaze
.
A
blush
,
too
,
--
the
redder
,
because
she
strove
hard
to
keep
it
*NL*
down
,
--
ascended
bigger
and
higher
,
in
a
tide
of
fitful
progress
,
until
*NL*
even
her
brow
was
all
suffused
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
enough
,
Phoebe
,
''
said
Clifford
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
.
``
When
*NL*
I
first
saw
you
,
you
were
the
prettiest
little
maiden
in
the
world
;
and
*NL*
now
you
have
deepened
into
beauty
.
Girlhood
has
passed
into
womanhood
;
*NL*
the
bud
is
a
bloom
!
Go
,
now
--
I
feel
lonelier
than
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebe
took
leave
of
the
desolate
couple
,
and
passed
through
the
shop
,
*NL*
twinkling
her
eyelids
to
shake
off
a
dew-drop
;
for
--
considering
how
*NL*
brief
her
absence
was
to
be
,
and
therefore
the
folly
of
being
cast
down
*NL*
about
it
--
she
would
not
so
far
acknowledge
her
tears
as
to
dry
them
*NL*
with
her
handkerchief
.
On
the
doorstep
,
she
met
the
little
urchin
*NL*
whose
marvellous
feats
of
gastronomy
have
been
recorded
in
the
earlier
*NL*
pages
of
our
narrative
.
She
took
from
the
window
some
specimen
or
*NL*
other
of
natural
history
,
--
her
eyes
being
too
dim
with
moisture
to
*NL*
inform
her
accurately
whether
it
was
a
rabbit
or
a
hippopotamus
,
--
put
*NL*
it
into
the
child
's
hand
as
a
parting
gift
,
and
went
her
way
.
Old
*NL*
Uncle
Venner
was
just
coming
out
of
his
door
,
with
a
wood-horse
and
saw
*NL*
on
his
shoulder
;
and
,
trudging
along
the
street
,
he
scrupled
not
to
*NL*
keep
company
with
Phoebe
,
so
far
as
their
paths
lay
together
;
nor
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
patched
coat
and
rusty
beaver
,
and
the
curious
fashion
of
*NL*
his
tow-cloth
trousers
,
could
she
find
it
in
her
heart
to
outwalk
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
miss
you
,
next
Sabbath
afternoon
,
''
observed
the
street
*NL*
philosopher
.
``
It
is
unaccountable
how
little
while
it
takes
some
folks
*NL*
to
grow
just
as
natural
to
a
man
as
his
own
breath
;
and
,
begging
your
*NL*
pardon
,
Miss
Phoebe
-LRB-
though
there
can
be
no
offence
in
an
old
man
's
*NL*
saying
it
-RRB-
,
that
's
just
what
you
've
grown
to
me
!
My
years
have
been
a
*NL*
great
many
,
and
your
life
is
but
just
beginning
;
and
yet
,
you
are
*NL*
somehow
as
familiar
to
me
as
if
I
had
found
you
at
my
mother
's
door
,
*NL*
and
you
had
blossomed
,
like
a
running
vine
,
all
along
my
pathway
since
.
*NL*
Come
back
soon
,
or
I
shall
be
gone
to
my
farm
;
for
I
begin
to
find
*NL*
these
wood-sawing
jobs
a
little
too
tough
for
my
back-ache
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
soon
,
Uncle
Venner
,
''
replied
Phoebe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
let
it
be
all
the
sooner
,
Phoebe
,
for
the
sake
of
those
poor
souls
*NL*
yonder
,
''
continued
her
companion
.
``
They
can
never
do
without
you
,
*NL*
now
,
--
never
,
Phoebe
;
never
--
no
more
than
if
one
of
God
's
angels
had
*NL*
been
living
with
them
,
and
making
their
dismal
house
pleasant
and
*NL*
comfortable
!
Do
n't
it
seem
to
you
they
'd
be
in
a
sad
case
,
if
,
some
*NL*
pleasant
summer
morning
like
this
,
the
angel
should
spread
his
wings
,
*NL*
and
fly
to
the
place
he
came
from
?
Well
,
just
so
they
feel
,
now
that
*NL*
you
're
going
home
by
the
railroad
!
They
ca
n't
bear
it
,
Miss
Phoebe
;
so
*NL*
be
sure
to
come
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
angel
,
Uncle
Venner
,
''
said
Phoebe
,
smiling
,
as
she
offered
him
*NL*
her
hand
at
the
street-corner
.
``
But
,
I
suppose
,
people
never
feel
so
*NL*
much
like
angels
as
when
they
are
doing
what
little
good
they
may
.
So
*NL*
I
shall
certainly
come
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
parted
the
old
man
and
the
rosy
girl
;
and
Phoebe
took
the
wings
of
*NL*
the
morning
,
and
was
soon
flitting
almost
as
rapidly
away
as
if
endowed
*NL*
with
the
aerial
locomotion
of
the
angels
to
whom
Uncle
Venner
had
so
*NL*
graciously
compared
her
.

XV
The
Scowl
and
Smile
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SEVERAL
days
passed
over
the
Seven
Gables
,
heavily
and
drearily
enough
.
*NL*
In
fact
-LRB-
not
to
attribute
the
whole
gloom
of
sky
and
earth
to
the
one
*NL*
inauspicious
circumstance
of
Phoebe
's
departure
-RRB-
,
an
easterly
storm
had
*NL*
set
in
,
and
indefatigably
apply
itself
to
the
task
of
making
the
black
*NL*
roof
and
walls
of
the
old
house
look
more
cheerless
than
ever
before
.
*NL*
Yet
was
the
outside
not
half
so
cheerless
as
the
interior
.
Poor
*NL*
Clifford
was
cut
off
,
at
once
,
from
all
his
scanty
resources
of
*NL*
enjoyment
.
Phoebe
was
not
there
;
nor
did
the
sunshine
fall
upon
the
*NL*
floor
.
The
garden
,
with
its
muddy
walks
,
and
the
chill
,
dripping
*NL*
foliage
of
its
summer-house
,
was
an
image
to
be
shuddered
at
.
Nothing
*NL*
flourished
in
the
cold
,
moist
,
pitiless
atmosphere
,
drifting
with
the
*NL*
brackish
scud
of
sea-breezes
,
except
the
moss
along
the
joints
of
the
*NL*
shingle-roof
,
and
the
great
bunch
of
weeds
,
that
had
lately
been
*NL*
suffering
from
drought
,
in
the
angle
between
the
two
front
gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Hepzibah
,
she
seemed
not
merely
possessed
with
the
east
wind
,
*NL*
but
to
be
,
in
her
very
person
,
only
another
phase
of
this
gray
and
*NL*
sullen
spell
of
weather
;
the
East-Wind
itself
,
grim
and
disconsolate
,
*NL*
in
a
rusty
black
silk
gown
,
and
with
a
turban
of
cloud-wreaths
on
its
*NL*
head
.
The
custom
of
the
shop
fell
off
,
because
a
story
got
abroad
that
*NL*
she
soured
her
small
beer
and
other
damageable
commodities
,
by
scowling
*NL*
on
them
.
It
is
,
perhaps
,
true
that
the
public
had
something
reasonably
*NL*
to
complain
of
in
her
deportment
;
but
towards
Clifford
she
was
neither
*NL*
ill-tempered
nor
unkind
,
nor
felt
less
warmth
of
heart
than
always
,
had
*NL*
it
been
possible
to
make
it
reach
him
.
The
inutility
of
her
best
*NL*
efforts
,
however
,
palsied
the
poor
old
gentlewoman
.
She
could
do
*NL*
little
else
than
sit
silently
in
a
corner
of
the
room
,
when
the
wet
*NL*
pear-tree
branches
,
sweeping
across
the
small
windows
,
created
a
*NL*
noonday
dusk
,
which
Hepzibah
unconsciously
darkened
with
her
woe-begone
*NL*
aspect
.
It
was
no
fault
of
Hepzibah
's
.
Everything
--
even
the
old
*NL*
chairs
and
tables
,
that
had
known
what
weather
was
for
three
or
four
*NL*
such
lifetimes
as
her
own
--
looked
as
damp
and
chill
as
if
the
present
*NL*
were
their
worst
experience
.
The
picture
of
the
Puritan
Colonel
*NL*
shivered
on
the
wall
.
The
house
itself
shivered
,
from
every
attic
of
*NL*
its
seven
gables
down
to
the
great
kitchen
fireplace
,
which
served
all
*NL*
the
better
as
an
emblem
of
the
mansion
's
heart
,
because
,
though
built
*NL*
for
warmth
,
it
was
now
so
comfortless
and
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
attempted
to
enliven
matters
by
a
fire
in
the
parlor
.
But
the
*NL*
storm
demon
kept
watch
above
,
and
,
whenever
a
flame
was
kindled
,
drove
*NL*
the
smoke
back
again
,
choking
the
chimney
's
sooty
throat
with
its
own
*NL*
breath
.
Nevertheless
,
during
four
days
of
this
miserable
storm
,
*NL*
Clifford
wrapt
himself
in
an
old
cloak
,
and
occupied
his
customary
*NL*
chair
.
On
the
morning
of
the
fifth
,
when
summoned
to
breakfast
,
he
*NL*
responded
only
by
a
broken-hearted
murmur
,
expressive
of
a
*NL*
determination
not
to
leave
his
bed
.
His
sister
made
no
attempt
to
*NL*
change
his
purpose
.
In
fact
,
entirely
as
she
loved
him
,
Hepzibah
could
*NL*
hardly
have
borne
any
longer
the
wretched
duty
--
so
impracticable
by
her
*NL*
few
and
rigid
faculties
--
of
seeking
pastime
for
a
still
sensitive
,
but
*NL*
ruined
mind
,
critical
and
fastidious
,
without
force
or
volition
.
It
*NL*
was
at
least
something
short
of
positive
despair
,
that
to-day
she
might
*NL*
sit
shivering
alone
,
and
not
suffer
continually
a
new
grief
,
and
*NL*
unreasonable
pang
of
remorse
,
at
every
fitful
sigh
of
her
fellow
*NL*
sufferer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Clifford
,
it
seemed
,
though
he
did
not
make
his
appearance
below
*NL*
stairs
,
had
,
after
all
,
bestirred
himself
in
quest
of
amusement
.
In
*NL*
the
course
of
the
forenoon
,
Hepzibah
heard
a
note
of
music
,
which
*NL*
-LRB-
there
being
no
other
tuneful
contrivance
in
the
House
of
the
Seven
*NL*
Gables
-RRB-
she
knew
must
proceed
from
Alice
Pyncheon
's
harpsichord
.
She
*NL*
was
aware
that
Clifford
,
in
his
youth
,
had
possessed
a
cultivated
taste
*NL*
for
music
,
and
a
considerable
degree
of
skill
in
its
practice
.
It
was
*NL*
difficult
,
however
,
to
conceive
of
his
retaining
an
accomplishment
to
*NL*
which
daily
exercise
is
so
essential
,
in
the
measure
indicated
by
the
*NL*
sweet
,
airy
,
and
delicate
,
though
most
melancholy
strain
,
that
now
*NL*
stole
upon
her
ear
.
Nor
was
it
less
marvellous
that
the
long-silent
*NL*
instrument
should
be
capable
of
so
much
melody
.
Hepzibah
involuntarily
*NL*
thought
of
the
ghostly
harmonies
,
prelusive
of
death
in
the
family
,
*NL*
which
were
attributed
to
the
legendary
Alice
.
But
it
was
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
proof
of
the
agency
of
other
than
spiritual
fingers
,
that
,
after
a
few
*NL*
touches
,
the
chords
seemed
to
snap
asunder
with
their
own
vibrations
,
*NL*
and
the
music
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
harsher
sound
succeeded
to
the
mysterious
notes
;
nor
was
the
*NL*
easterly
day
fated
to
pass
without
an
event
sufficient
in
itself
to
*NL*
poison
,
for
Hepzibah
and
Clifford
,
the
balmiest
air
that
ever
brought
*NL*
the
humming-birds
along
with
it
.
The
final
echoes
of
Alice
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
performance
-LRB-
or
Clifford
's
,
if
his
we
must
consider
it
-RRB-
were
driven
*NL*
away
by
no
less
vulgar
a
dissonance
than
the
ringing
of
the
shop-bell
.
*NL*
A
foot
was
heard
scraping
itself
on
the
threshold
,
and
thence
somewhat
*NL*
ponderously
stepping
on
the
floor
.
Hepzibah
delayed
a
moment
,
while
*NL*
muffling
herself
in
a
faded
shawl
,
which
had
been
her
defensive
armor
*NL*
in
a
forty
years
'
warfare
against
the
east
wind
.
A
characteristic
*NL*
sound
,
however
,
--
neither
a
cough
nor
a
hem
,
but
a
kind
of
rumbling
and
*NL*
reverberating
spasm
in
somebody
's
capacious
depth
of
chest
;
--
impelled
*NL*
her
to
hurry
forward
,
with
that
aspect
of
fierce
faint-heartedness
so
*NL*
common
to
women
in
cases
of
perilous
emergency
.
Few
of
her
sex
,
on
*NL*
such
occasions
,
have
ever
looked
so
terrible
as
our
poor
scowling
*NL*
Hepzibah
.
But
the
visitor
quietly
closed
the
shop-door
behind
him
,
*NL*
stood
up
his
umbrella
against
the
counter
,
and
turned
a
visage
of
*NL*
composed
benignity
,
to
meet
the
alarm
and
anger
which
his
appearance
*NL*
had
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
presentiment
had
not
deceived
her
.
It
was
no
other
than
*NL*
Judge
Pyncheon
,
who
,
after
in
vain
trying
the
front
door
,
had
now
*NL*
effected
his
entrance
into
the
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Cousin
Hepzibah
?
--
and
how
does
this
most
inclement
*NL*
weather
affect
our
poor
Clifford
?
''
began
the
Judge
;
and
wonderful
it
*NL*
seemed
,
indeed
,
that
the
easterly
storm
was
not
put
to
shame
,
or
,
at
*NL*
any
rate
,
a
little
mollified
,
by
the
genial
benevolence
of
his
smile
.
*NL*
``
I
could
not
rest
without
calling
to
ask
,
once
more
,
whether
I
can
in
*NL*
any
manner
promote
his
comfort
,
or
your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
do
nothing
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
controlling
her
agitation
as
well
*NL*
as
she
could
.
``
I
devote
myself
to
Clifford
.
He
has
every
comfort
*NL*
which
his
situation
admits
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
allow
me
to
suggest
,
dear
cousin
,
''
rejoined
the
Judge
,
``
you
*NL*
err
,
--
in
all
affection
and
kindness
,
no
doubt
,
and
with
the
very
best
*NL*
intentions
,
--
but
you
do
err
,
nevertheless
,
in
keeping
your
brother
so
*NL*
secluded
.
Why
insulate
him
thus
from
all
sympathy
and
kindness
?
*NL*
Clifford
,
alas
!
has
had
too
much
of
solitude
.
Now
let
him
try
*NL*
society
,
--
the
society
,
that
is
to
say
,
of
kindred
and
old
friends
.
Let
*NL*
me
,
for
instance
,
but
see
Clifford
,
and
I
will
answer
for
the
good
*NL*
effect
of
the
interview
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
see
him
,
''
answered
Hepzibah
.
``
Clifford
has
kept
his
bed
*NL*
since
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
How
!
Is
he
ill
?
''
exclaimed
Judge
Pyncheon
,
starting
with
what
*NL*
seemed
to
be
angry
alarm
;
for
the
very
frown
of
the
old
Puritan
*NL*
darkened
through
the
room
as
he
spoke
.
``
Nay
,
then
,
I
must
and
will
see
*NL*
him
!
What
if
he
should
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
in
no
danger
of
death
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
--
and
added
,
with
*NL*
bitterness
that
she
could
repress
no
longer
,
``
none
;
unless
he
shall
be
*NL*
persecuted
to
death
,
now
,
by
the
same
man
who
long
ago
attempted
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cousin
Hepzibah
,
''
said
the
Judge
,
with
an
impressive
earnestness
of
*NL*
manner
,
which
grew
even
to
tearful
pathos
as
he
proceeded
,
``
is
it
*NL*
possible
that
you
do
not
perceive
how
unjust
,
how
unkind
,
how
*NL*
unchristian
,
is
this
constant
,
this
long-continued
bitterness
against
*NL*
me
,
for
a
part
which
I
was
constrained
by
duty
and
conscience
,
by
the
*NL*
force
of
law
,
and
at
my
own
peril
,
to
act
?
What
did
I
do
,
in
detriment
*NL*
to
Clifford
,
which
it
was
possible
to
leave
undone
?
How
could
you
,
his
*NL*
sister
,
--
if
,
for
your
never-ending
sorrow
,
as
it
has
been
for
mine
,
you
*NL*
had
known
what
I
did
,
--
have
,
shown
greater
tenderness
?
And
do
you
*NL*
think
,
cousin
,
that
it
has
cost
me
no
pang
?
--
that
it
has
left
no
*NL*
anguish
in
my
bosom
,
from
that
day
to
this
,
amidst
all
the
prosperity
*NL*
with
which
Heaven
has
blessed
me
?
--
or
that
I
do
not
now
rejoice
,
when
*NL*
it
is
deemed
consistent
with
the
dues
of
public
justice
and
the
welfare
*NL*
of
society
that
this
dear
kinsman
,
this
early
friend
,
this
nature
so
*NL*
delicately
and
beautifully
constituted
,
--
so
unfortunate
,
let
us
*NL*
pronounce
him
,
and
forbear
to
say
,
so
guilty
,
--
that
our
own
Clifford
,
*NL*
in
fine
,
should
be
given
back
to
life
,
and
its
possibilities
of
*NL*
enjoyment
?
Ah
,
you
little
know
me
,
Cousin
Hepzibah
!
You
little
know
*NL*
this
heart
!
It
now
throbs
at
the
thought
of
meeting
him
!
There
lives
*NL*
not
the
human
being
-LRB-
except
yourself
,
--
and
you
not
more
than
I
-RRB-
who
has
*NL*
shed
so
many
tears
for
Clifford
's
calamity
.
You
behold
some
of
them
*NL*
now
.
There
is
none
who
would
so
delight
to
promote
his
happiness
!
Try
*NL*
me
,
Hepzibah
!
--
try
me
,
Cousin
!
--
try
the
man
whom
you
have
treated
as
*NL*
your
enemy
and
Clifford
's
!
--
try
Jaffrey
Pyncheon
,
and
you
shall
find
*NL*
him
true
,
to
the
heart
's
core
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
Heaven
,
''
cried
Hepzibah
,
provoked
only
to
intenser
*NL*
indignation
by
this
outgush
of
the
inestimable
tenderness
of
a
stern
*NL*
nature
,
--
``
in
God
's
name
,
whom
you
insult
,
and
whose
power
I
could
*NL*
almost
question
,
since
he
hears
you
utter
so
many
false
words
without
*NL*
palsying
your
tongue
,
--
give
over
,
I
beseech
you
,
this
loathsome
*NL*
pretence
of
affection
for
your
victim
!
You
hate
him
!
Say
so
,
like
a
*NL*
man
!
You
cherish
,
at
this
moment
,
some
black
purpose
against
him
in
*NL*
your
heart
!
Speak
it
out
,
at
once
!
--
or
,
if
you
hope
so
to
promote
it
*NL*
better
,
hide
it
till
you
can
triumph
in
its
success
!
But
never
speak
*NL*
again
of
your
love
for
my
poor
brother

I
can
not
bear
it
!
It
will
*NL*
drive
me
beyond
a
woman
's
decency
!
It
will
drive
me
mad
!
Forbear
!
Not
*NL*
another

!
It
will
make
me
spurn
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
once
,
Hepzibah
's
wrath
had
given
her
courage
.
She
had
spoken
.
*NL*
But
,
after
all
,
was
this
unconquerable
distrust
of
Judge
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
integrity
,
and
this
utter
denial
,
apparently
,
of
his
claim
to
stand
in
*NL*
the
ring
of
human
sympathies
,
--
were
they
founded
in
any
just
perception
*NL*
of
his
character
,
or
merely
the
offspring
of
a
woman
's
unreasonable
*NL*
prejudice
,
deduced
from
nothing
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
Judge
,
beyond
all
question
,
was
a
man
of
eminent
respectability
.
*NL*
The
church
acknowledged
it
;
the
state
acknowledged
it
.
It
was
denied
*NL*
by
nobody
.
In
all
the
very
extensive
sphere
of
those
who
knew
him
,
*NL*
whether
in
his
public
or
private
capacities
,
there
was
not
an
*NL*
individual
--
except
Hepzibah
,
and
some
lawless
mystic
,
like
the
*NL*
daguerreotypist
,
and
,
possibly
,
a
few
political
opponents
--
who
would
*NL*
have
dreamed
of
seriously
disputing
his
claim
to
a
high
and
honorable
*NL*
place
in
the
world
's
regard
.
Nor
-LRB-
we
must
do
him
the
further
justice
*NL*
to
say
-RRB-
did
Judge
Pyncheon
himself
,
probably
,
entertain
many
or
very
*NL*
frequent
doubts
,
that
his
enviable
reputation
accorded
with
his
*NL*
deserts
.
His
conscience
,
therefore
,
usually
considered
the
surest
*NL*
witness
to
a
man
's
integrity
,
--
his
conscience
,
unless
it
might
be
for
*NL*
the
little
space
of
five
minutes
in
the
twenty-four
hours
,
or
,
now
and
*NL*
then
,
some
black
day
in
the
whole
year
's
circle
,
--
his
conscience
bore
*NL*
an
accordant
testimony
with
the
world
's
laudatory
voice
.
And
yet
,
*NL*
strong
as
this
evidence
may
seem
to
be
,
we
should
hesitate
to
peril
our
*NL*
own
conscience
on
the
assertion
,
that
the
Judge
and
the
consenting
*NL*
world
were
right
,
and
that
poor
Hepzibah
with
her
solitary
prejudice
*NL*
was
wrong
.
Hidden
from
mankind
,
--
forgotten
by
himself
,
or
buried
so
*NL*
deeply
under
a
sculptured
and
ornamented
pile
of
ostentatious
deeds
*NL*
that
his
daily
life
could
take
no
note
of
it
,
--
there
may
have
lurked
*NL*
some
evil
and
unsightly
thing
.
Nay
,
we
could
almost
venture
to
say
,
*NL*
further
,
that
a
daily
guilt
might
have
been
acted
by
him
,
continually
*NL*
renewed
,
and
reddening
forth
afresh
,
like
the
miraculous
blood-stain
of
*NL*
a
murder
,
without
his
necessarily
and
at
every
moment
being
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
of
strong
minds
,
great
force
of
character
,
and
a
hard
texture
of
*NL*
the
sensibilities
,
are
very
capable
of
falling
into
mistakes
of
this
*NL*
kind
.
They
are
ordinarily
men
to
whom
forms
are
of
paramount
*NL*
importance
.
Their
field
of
action
lies
among
the
external
phenomena
of
*NL*
life
.
They
possess
vast
ability
in
grasping
,
and
arranging
,
and
*NL*
appropriating
to
themselves
,
the
big
,
heavy
,
solid
unrealities
,
such
as
*NL*
gold
,
landed
estate
,
offices
of
trust
and
emolument
,
and
public
honors
.
*NL*
With
these
materials
,
and
with
deeds
of
goodly
aspect
,
done
in
the
*NL*
public
eye
,
an
individual
of
this
class
builds
up
,
as
it
were
,
a
tall
*NL*
and
stately
edifice
,
which
,
in
the
view
of
other
people
,
and
ultimately
*NL*
in
his
own
view
,
is
no
other
than
the
man
's
character
,
or
the
man
*NL*
himself
.
Behold
,
therefore
,
a
palace
!
Its
splendid
halls
and
suites
of
*NL*
spacious
apartments
are
floored
with
a
mosaic-work
of
costly
marbles
;
*NL*
its
windows
,
the
whole
height
of
each
room
,
admit
the
sunshine
through
*NL*
the
most
transparent
of
plate-glass
;
its
high
cornices
are
gilded
,
and
*NL*
its
ceilings
gorgeously
painted
;
and
a
lofty
dome
--
through
which
,
from
*NL*
the
central
pavement
,
you
may
gaze
up
to
the
sky
,
as
with
no
*NL*
obstructing
medium
between
--
surmounts
the
whole
.
With
what
fairer
and
*NL*
nobler
emblem
could
any
man
desire
to
shadow
forth
his
character
?
Ah
!
*NL*
but
in
some
low
and
obscure
nook
,
--
some
narrow
closet
on
the
*NL*
ground-floor
,
shut
,
locked
and
bolted
,
and
the
key
flung
away
,
--
or
*NL*
beneath
the
marble
pavement
,
in
a
stagnant
water-puddle
,
with
the
*NL*
richest
pattern
of
mosaic-work
above
,
--
may
lie
a
corpse
,
half
decayed
,
*NL*
and
still
decaying
,
and
diffusing
its
death-scent
all
through
the
*NL*
palace
!
The
inhabitant
will
not
be
conscious
of
it
,
for
it
has
long
*NL*
been
his
daily
breath
!
Neither
will
the
visitors
,
for
they
smell
only
*NL*
the
rich
odors
which
the
master
sedulously
scatters
through
the
palace
,
*NL*
and
the
incense
which
they
bring
,
and
delight
to
burn
before
him
!
Now
*NL*
and
then
,
perchance
,
comes
in
a
seer
,
before
whose
sadly
gifted
eye
the
*NL*
whole
structure
melts
into
thin
air
,
leaving
only
the
hidden
nook
,
the
*NL*
bolted
closet
,
with
the
cobwebs
festooned
over
its
forgotten
door
,
or
*NL*
the
deadly
hole
under
the
pavement
,
and
the
decaying
corpse
within
.
*NL*
Here
,
then
,
we
are
to
seek
the
true
emblem
of
the
man
's
character
,
and
*NL*
of
the
deed
that
gives
whatever
reality
it
possesses
to
his
life
.
And
,
*NL*
beneath
the
show
of
a
marble
palace
,
that
pool
of
stagnant
water
,
foul
*NL*
with
many
impurities
,
and
,
perhaps
,
tinged
with
blood
,
--
that
secret
*NL*
abomination
,
above
which
,
possibly
,
he
may
say
his
prayers
,
without
*NL*
remembering
it
,
--
is
this
man
's
miserable
soul
!
*NL*
*NL*
To
apply
this
train
of
remark
somewhat
more
closely
to
Judge
Pyncheon
.
*NL*
We
might
say
-LRB-
without
in
the
least
imputing
crime
to
a
personage
of
his
*NL*
eminent
respectability
-RRB-
that
there
was
enough
of
splendid
rubbish
in
*NL*
his
life
to
cover
up
and
paralyze
a
more
active
and
subtile
conscience
*NL*
than
the
Judge
was
ever
troubled
with
.
The
purity
of
his
judicial
*NL*
character
,
while
on
the
bench
;
the
faithfulness
of
his
public
service
*NL*
in
subsequent
capacities
;
his
devotedness
to
his
party
,
and
the
rigid
*NL*
consistency
with
which
he
had
adhered
to
its
principles
,
or
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
kept
pace
with
its
organized
movements
;
his
remarkable
zeal
as
*NL*
president
of
a
Bible
society
;
his
unimpeachable
integrity
as
treasurer
*NL*
of
a
widow
's
and
orphan
's
fund
;
his
benefits
to
horticulture
,
by
*NL*
producing
two
much
esteemed
varieties
of
the
pear
and
to
agriculture
,
*NL*
through
the
agency
of
the
famous
Pyncheon
bull
;
the
cleanliness
of
his
*NL*
moral
deportment
,
for
a
great
many
years
past
;
the
severity
with
which
*NL*
he
had
frowned
upon
,
and
finally
cast
off
,
an
expensive
and
dissipated
*NL*
son
,
delaying
forgiveness
until
within
the
final
quarter
of
an
hour
of
*NL*
the
young
man
's
life
;
his
prayers
at
morning
and
eventide
,
and
graces
*NL*
at
meal-time
;
his
efforts
in
furtherance
of
the
temperance
cause
;
his
*NL*
confining
himself
,
since
the
last
attack
of
the
gout
,
to
five
diurnal
*NL*
glasses
of
old
sherry
wine
;
the
snowy
whiteness
of
his
linen
,
the
*NL*
polish
of
his
boots
,
the
handsomeness
of
his
gold-headed
cane
,
the
*NL*
square
and
roomy
fashion
of
his
coat
,
and
the
fineness
of
its
material
,
*NL*
and
,
in
general
,
the
studied
propriety
of
his
dress
and
equipment
;
the
*NL*
scrupulousness
with
which
he
paid
public
notice
,
in
the
street
,
by
a
*NL*
bow
,
a
lifting
of
the
hat
,
a
nod
,
or
a
motion
of
the
hand
,
to
all
and
*NL*
sundry
of
his
acquaintances
,
rich
or
poor
;
the
smile
of
broad
*NL*
benevolence
wherewith
he
made
it
a
point
to
gladden
the
whole
*NL*
world
,
--
what
room
could
possibly
be
found
for
darker
traits
in
a
*NL*
portrait
made
up
of
lineaments
like
these
?
This
proper
face
was
what
he
*NL*
beheld
in
the
looking-glass
.
This
admirably
arranged
life
was
what
he
*NL*
was
conscious
of
in
the
progress
of
every
day
.
Then
might
not
he
claim
*NL*
to
be
its
result
and
sum
,
and
say
to
himself
and
the
community
,
``
Behold
*NL*
Judge
Pyncheon
there
''
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
allowing
that
,
many
,
many
years
ago
,
in
his
early
and
reckless
*NL*
youth
,
he
had
committed
some
one
wrong
act
,
--
or
that
,
even
now
,
the
*NL*
inevitable
force
of
circumstances
should
occasionally
make
him
do
one
*NL*
questionable
deed
among
a
thousand
praiseworthy
,
or
,
at
least
,
*NL*
blameless
ones
,
--
would
you
characterize
the
Judge
by
that
one
necessary
*NL*
deed
,
and
that
half-forgotten
act
,
and
let
it
overshadow
the
fair
*NL*
aspect
of
a
lifetime
?
What
is
there
so
ponderous
in
evil
,
that
a
*NL*
thumb
's
bigness
of
it
should
outweigh
the
mass
of
things
not
evil
which
*NL*
were
heaped
into
the
other
scale
!
This
scale
and
balance
system
is
a
*NL*
favorite
one
with
people
of
Judge
Pyncheon
's
brotherhood
.
A
hard
,
cold
*NL*
man
,
thus
unfortunately
situated
,
seldom
or
never
looking
inward
,
and
*NL*
resolutely
taking
his
idea
of
himself
from
what
purports
to
be
his
*NL*
image
as
reflected
in
the
mirror
of
public
opinion
,
can
scarcely
arrive
*NL*
at
true
self-knowledge
,
except
through
loss
of
property
and
reputation
.
*NL*
Sickness
will
not
always
help
him
do
it
;
not
always
the
death-hour
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
our
affair
now
is
with
Judge
Pyncheon
as
he
stood
confronting
the
*NL*
fierce
outbreak
of
Hepzibah
's
wrath
.
Without
premeditation
,
to
her
own
*NL*
surprise
,
and
indeed
terror
,
she
had
given
vent
,
for
once
,
to
the
*NL*
inveteracy
of
her
resentment
,
cherished
against
this
kinsman
for
thirty
*NL*
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
far
the
Judge
's
countenance
had
expressed
mild
forbearance
,
--
grave
*NL*
and
almost
gentle
deprecation
of
his
cousin
's
unbecoming
*NL*
violence
,
--
free
and
Christian-like
forgiveness
of
the
wrong
inflicted
*NL*
by
her
words
.
But
when
those
words
were
irrevocably
spoken
,
his
look
*NL*
assumed
sternness
,
the
sense
of
power
,
and
immitigable
resolve
;
and
*NL*
this
with
so
natural
and
imperceptible
a
change
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
*NL*
the
iron
man
had
stood
there
from
the
first
,
and
the
meek
man
not
at
*NL*
all
.
The
effect
was
as
when
the
light
,
vapory
clouds
,
with
their
soft
*NL*
coloring
,
suddenly
vanish
from
the
stony
brow
of
a
precipitous
*NL*
mountain
,
and
leave
there
the
frown
which
you
at
once
feel
to
be
*NL*
eternal
.
Hepzibah
almost
adopted
the
insane
belief
that
it
was
her
old
*NL*
Puritan
ancestor
,
and
not
the
modern
Judge
,
on
whom
she
had
just
been
*NL*
wreaking
the
bitterness
of
her
heart
.
Never
did
a
man
show
stronger
*NL*
proof
of
the
lineage
attributed
to
him
than
Judge
Pyncheon
,
at
this
*NL*
crisis
,
by
his
unmistakable
resemblance
to
the
picture
in
the
inner
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cousin
Hepzibah
,
''
said
he
very
calmly
,
``
it
is
time
to
have
done
with
*NL*
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
!
''
answered
she
.
``
Then
,
why
do
you
persecute
us
any
*NL*
longer
?
Leave
poor
Clifford
and
me
in
peace
.
Neither
of
us
desires
*NL*
anything
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
purpose
to
see
Clifford
before
I
leave
this
house
,
''
continued
*NL*
the
Judge
.
``
Do
not
act
like
a
madwoman
,
Hepzibah
!
I
am
his
only
*NL*
friend
,
and
an
all-powerful
one
.
Has
it
never
occurred
to
you
,
--
are
*NL*
you
so
blind
as
not
to
have
seen
,
--
that
,
without
not
merely
my
consent
,
*NL*
but
my
efforts
,
my
representations
,
the
exertion
of
my
whole
influence
,
*NL*
political
,
official
,
personal
,
Clifford
would
never
have
been
what
you
*NL*
call
free
?
Did
you
think
his
release
a
triumph
over
me
?
Not
so
,
my
good
*NL*
cousin
;
not
so
,
by
any
means
!
The
furthest
possible
from
that
!
No
;
but
*NL*
it
was
the
accomplishment
of
a
purpose
long
entertained
on
my
part
.
I
*NL*
set
him
free
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
!
''
answered
Hepzibah
.
``
I
never
will
believe
it
!
He
owed
his
*NL*
dungeon
to
you
;
his
freedom
to
God
's
providence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
set
him
free
!
''
reaffirmed
Judge
Pyncheon
,
with
the
calmest
*NL*
composure
.
``
And
I
came
hither
now
to
decide
whether
he
shall
retain
*NL*
his
freedom
.
It
will
depend
upon
himself
.
For
this
purpose
,
I
must
*NL*
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
--
it
would
drive
him
mad
!
''
exclaimed
Hepzibah
,
but
with
an
*NL*
irresoluteness
sufficiently
perceptible
to
the
keen
eye
of
the
Judge
;
*NL*
for
,
without
the
slightest
faith
in
his
good
intentions
,
she
knew
not
*NL*
whether
there
was
most
to
dread
in
yielding
or
resistance
.
``
And
why
*NL*
should
you
wish
to
see
this
wretched
,
broken
man
,
who
retains
hardly
a
*NL*
fraction
of
his
intellect
,
and
will
hide
even
that
from
an
eye
which
*NL*
has
no
love
in
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
shall
see
love
enough
in
mine
,
if
that
be
all
!
''
said
the
Judge
,
*NL*
with
well-grounded
confidence
in
the
benignity
of
his
aspect
.
``
But
,
*NL*
Cousin
Hepzibah
,
you
confess
a
great
deal
,
and
very
much
to
the
*NL*
purpose
.
Now
,
listen
,
and
I
will
frankly
explain
my
reasons
for
*NL*
insisting
on
this
interview
.
At
the
death
,
thirty
years
since
,
of
our
*NL*
uncle
Jaffrey
,
it
was
found
,
--
I
know
not
whether
the
circumstance
ever
*NL*
attracted
much
of
your
attention
,
among
the
sadder
interests
that
*NL*
clustered
round
that
event
,
--
but
it
was
found
that
his
visible
estate
,
*NL*
of
every
kind
,
fell
far
short
of
any
estimate
ever
made
of
it
.
He
was
*NL*
supposed
to
be
immensely
rich
.
Nobody
doubted
that
he
stood
among
the
*NL*
weightiest
men
of
his
day
.
It
was
one
of
his
eccentricities
,
*NL*
however
,
--
and
not
altogether
a
folly
,
neither
,
--
to
conceal
the
amount
*NL*
of
his
property
by
making
distant
and
foreign
investments
,
perhaps
*NL*
under
other
names
than
his
own
,
and
by
various
means
,
familiar
enough
*NL*
to
capitalists
,
but
unnecessary
here
to
be
specified
.
By
Uncle
*NL*
Jaffrey
's
last
will
and
testament
,
as
you
are
aware
,
his
entire
*NL*
property
was
bequeathed
to
me
,
with
the
single
exception
of
a
life
*NL*
interest
to
yourself
in
this
old
family
mansion
,
and
the
strip
of
*NL*
patrimonial
estate
remaining
attached
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
seek
to
deprive
us
of
that
?
''
asked
Hepzibah
,
unable
to
*NL*
restrain
her
bitter
contempt
.
``
Is
this
your
price
for
ceasing
to
*NL*
persecute
poor
Clifford
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
my
dear
cousin
!
''
answered
the
Judge
,
smiling
*NL*
benevolently
.
``
On
the
contrary
,
as
you
must
do
me
the
justice
to
own
,
*NL*
I
have
constantly
expressed
my
readiness
to
double
or
treble
your
*NL*
resources
,
whenever
you
should
make
up
your
mind
to
accept
any
kindness
*NL*
of
that
nature
at
the
hands
of
your
kinsman
.
No
,
no
!
But
here
lies
*NL*
the
gist
of
the
matter
.
Of
my
uncle
's
unquestionably
great
estate
,
as
*NL*
I
have
said
,
not
the
half
--
no
,
not
one
third
,
as
I
am
fully
*NL*
convinced
--
was
apparent
after
his
death
.
Now
,
I
have
the
best
possible
*NL*
reasons
for
believing
that
your
brother
Clifford
can
give
me
a
clew
to
*NL*
the
recovery
of
the
remainder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clifford
!
--
Clifford
know
of
any
hidden
wealth
?
Clifford
have
it
in
his
*NL*
power
to
make
you
rich
?
''
cried
the
old
gentlewoman
,
affected
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
something
like
ridicule
at
the
idea
.
``
Impossible
!
You
*NL*
deceive
yourself
!
It
is
really
a
thing
to
laugh
at
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
as
certain
as
that
I
stand
here
!
''
said
Judge
Pyncheon
,
striking
*NL*
his
gold-headed
cane
on
the
floor
,
and
at
the
same
time
stamping
his
*NL*
foot
,
as
if
to
express
his
conviction
the
more
forcibly
by
the
whole
*NL*
emphasis
of
his
substantial
person
.
``
Clifford
told
me
so
himself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
exclaimed
Hepzibah
incredulously
.
``
You
are
dreaming
,
Cousin
*NL*
Jaffrey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
belong
to
the
dreaming
class
of
men
,
''
said
the
Judge
quietly
.
*NL*
``
Some
months
before
my
uncle
's
death
,
Clifford
boasted
to
me
of
the
*NL*
possession
of
the
secret
of
incalculable
wealth
.
His
purpose
was
to
*NL*
taunt
me
,
and
excite
my
curiosity
.
I
know
it
well
.
But
,
from
a
pretty
*NL*
distinct
recollection
of
the
particulars
of
our
conversation
,
I
am
*NL*
thoroughly
convinced
that
there
was
truth
in
what
he
said
.
Clifford
,
*NL*
at
this
moment
,
if
he
chooses
,
--
and
choose
he
must
!
--
can
inform
me
*NL*
where
to
find
the
schedule
,
the
documents
,
the
evidences
,
in
whatever
*NL*
shape
they
exist
,
of
the
vast
amount
of
Uncle
Jaffrey
's
missing
*NL*
property
.
He
has
the
secret
.
His
boast
was
no
idle
word
.
It
had
a
*NL*
directness
,
an
emphasis
,
a
particularity
,
that
showed
a
backbone
of
*NL*
solid
meaning
within
the
mystery
of
his
expression
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
could
have
been
Clifford
's
object
,
''
asked
Hepzibah
,
``
in
*NL*
concealing
it
so
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
one
of
the
bad
impulses
of
our
fallen
nature
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
Judge
,
turning
up
his
eyes
.
``
He
looked
upon
me
as
his
enemy
.
He
*NL*
considered
me
as
the
cause
of
his
overwhelming
disgrace
,
his
imminent
*NL*
peril
of
death
,
his
irretrievable
ruin
.
There
was
no
great
*NL*
probability
,
therefore
,
of
his
volunteering
information
,
out
of
his
*NL*
dungeon
,
that
should
elevate
me
still
higher
on
the
ladder
of
*NL*
prosperity
.
But
the
moment
has
now
come
when
he
must
give
up
his
*NL*
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
if
he
should
refuse
?
''
inquired
Hepzibah
.
``
Or
,
--
as
I
*NL*
steadfastly
believe
,
--
what
if
he
has
no
knowledge
of
this
wealth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
cousin
,
''
said
Judge
Pyncheon
,
with
a
quietude
which
he
had
the
*NL*
power
of
making
more
formidable
than
any
violence
,
``
since
your
*NL*
brother
's
return
,
I
have
taken
the
precaution
-LRB-
a
highly
proper
one
in
*NL*
the
near
kinsman
and
natural
guardian
of
an
individual
so
situated
-RRB-
to
*NL*
have
his
deportment
and
habits
constantly
and
carefully
overlooked
.
*NL*
Your
neighbors
have
been
eye-witnesses
to
whatever
has
passed
in
the
*NL*
garden
.
The
butcher
,
the
baker
,
the
fish-monger
,
some
of
the
customers
*NL*
of
your
shop
,
and
many
a
prying
old
woman
,
have
told
me
several
of
the
*NL*
secrets
of
your
interior
.
A
still
larger
circle
--
I
myself
,
among
the
*NL*
rest
--
can
testify
to
his
extravagances
at
the
arched
window
.
Thousands
*NL*
beheld
him
,
a
week
or
two
ago
,
on
the
point
of
flinging
himself
thence
*NL*
into
the
street
.
From
all
this
testimony
,
I
am
led
to
*NL*
apprehend
--
reluctantly
,
and
with
deep
grief
--
that
Clifford
's
*NL*
misfortunes
have
so
affected
his
intellect
,
never
very
strong
,
that
he
*NL*
can
not
safely
remain
at
large
.
The
alternative
,
you
must
be
*NL*
aware
,
--
and
its
adoption
will
depend
entirely
on
the
decision
which
I
*NL*
am
now
about
to
make
,
--
the
alternative
is
his
confinement
,
probably
for
*NL*
the
remainder
of
his
life
,
in
a
public
asylum
for
persons
in
his
*NL*
unfortunate
state
of
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
mean
it
!
''
shrieked
Hepzibah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
my
cousin
Clifford
,
''
continued
Judge
Pyncheon
,
wholly
*NL*
undisturbed
,
``
from
mere
malice
,
and
hatred
of
one
whose
interests
ought
*NL*
naturally
to
be
dear
to
him
,
--
a
mode
of
passion
that
,
as
often
as
any
*NL*
other
,
indicates
mental
disease
,
--
should
he
refuse
me
the
information
*NL*
so
important
to
myself
,
and
which
he
assuredly
possesses
,
I
shall
*NL*
consider
it
the
one
needed
jot
of
evidence
to
satisfy
my
mind
of
his
*NL*
insanity
.
And
,
once
sure
of
the
course
pointed
out
by
conscience
,
you
*NL*
know
me
too
well

Cousin
Hepzibah

to
entertain
a
doubt
that
I
shall
*NL*
pursue
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Jaffrey

Cousin
Jaffrey

cried
Hepzibah
mournfully
,
not
*NL*
passionately
,
``
it
is
you
that
are
diseased
in
mind
,
not
Clifford
!
You
*NL*
have
forgotten
that
a
woman
was
your
mother
!
--
that
you
have
had
*NL*
sisters
,
brothers
,
children
of
your
own
!
--
or
that
there
ever
was
*NL*
affection
between
man
and
man
,
or
pity
from
one
man
to
another
,
in
this
*NL*
miserable
world
!
Else
,
how
could
you
have
dreamed
of
this
?
You
are
not
*NL*
young
,
Cousin
Jaffrey
!
--
no
,
nor
middle-aged
,
--
but
already
an
old
man
!
*NL*
The
hair
is
white
upon
your
head
!
How
many
years
have
you
to
live
?
Are
*NL*
you
not
rich
enough
for
that
little
time
?
Shall
you
be
hungry
,
--
shall
*NL*
you
lack
clothes
,
or
a
roof
to
shelter
you
,
--
between
this
point
and
the
*NL*
grave
?
No
!
but
,
with
the
half
of
what
you
now
possess
,
you
could
revel
*NL*
in
costly
food
and
wines
,
and
build
a
house
twice
as
splendid
as
you
*NL*
now
inhabit
,
and
make
a
far
greater
show
to
the
world
,
--
and
yet
leave
*NL*
riches
to
your
only
son
,
to
make
him
bless
the
hour
of
your
death
!
*NL*
Then
,
why
should
you
do
this
cruel
,
cruel
thing
?
--
so
mad
a
thing
,
that
*NL*
I
know
not
whether
to
call
it
wicked
!
Alas
,
Cousin
Jaffrey
,
this
hard
*NL*
and
grasping
spirit
has
run
in
our
blood
these
two
hundred
years
.
You
*NL*
are
but
doing
over
again
,
in
another
shape
,
what
your
ancestor
before
*NL*
you
did
,
and
sending
down
to
your
posterity
the
curse
inherited
from
*NL*
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talk
sense
,
Hepzibah
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
!
''
exclaimed
the
Judge
,
with
*NL*
the
impatience
natural
to
a
reasonable
man
,
on
hearing
anything
so
*NL*
utterly
absurd
as
the
above
,
in
a
discussion
about
matters
of
business
.
*NL*
``
I
have
told
you
my
determination
.
I
am
not
apt
to
change
.
Clifford
*NL*
must
give
up
his
secret
,
or
take
the
consequences
.
And
let
him
decide
*NL*
quickly
;
for
I
have
several
affairs
to
attend
to
this
morning
,
and
an
*NL*
important
dinner
engagement
with
some
political
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clifford
has
no
secret

answered
Hepzibah
.
``
And
God
will
not
let
you
*NL*
do
the
thing
you
meditate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
,
''
said
the
unmoved
Judge
.
``
Meanwhile
,
choose
whether
you
*NL*
will
summon
Clifford
,
and
allow
this
business
to
be
amicably
settled
by
*NL*
an
interview
between
two
kinsmen
,
or
drive
me
to
harsher
measures
,
*NL*
which
I
should
be
most
happy
to
feel
myself
justified
in
avoiding
.
The
*NL*
responsibility
is
altogether
on
your
part

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
stronger
than
I
,
''
said
Hepzibah
,
after
a
brief
consideration
;
*NL*
``
and
you
have
no
pity
in
your
strength
!
Clifford
is
not
now
insane
;
but
*NL*
the
interview
which
you
insist
upon
may
go
far
to
make
him
so
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
knowing
you
as
I
do
,
I
believe
it
to
be
my
best
course
to
*NL*
allow
you
to
judge
for
yourself
as
to
the
improbability
of
his
*NL*
possessing
any
valuable
secret
.
I
will
call
Clifford
.
Be
merciful
in
*NL*
your
dealings
with
him
!
--
be
far
more
merciful
than
your
heart
bids
you
*NL*
be
!

for
God
is
looking
at
you

Pyncheon

*NL*
The
Judge
followed
his
cousin
from
the
shop
,
where
the
foregoing
*NL*
conversation
had
passed
,
into
the
parlor
,
and
flung
himself
heavily
*NL*
into
the
great
ancestral
chair
.
Many
a
former
Pyncheon
had
found
*NL*
repose
in
its
capacious
arms
:
rosy
children
,
after
their
sports
;
young
*NL*
men
,
dreamy
with
love
;
grown
men
,
weary
with
cares
;
old
men
,
burdened
*NL*
with
winters
,
--
they
had
mused
,
and
slumbered
,
and
departed
to
a
yet
*NL*
profounder
sleep
.
It
had
been
a
long
tradition
,
though
a
doubtful
one
,
*NL*
that
this
was
the
very
chair
,
seated
in
which
the
earliest
of
the
*NL*
Judge
's
New
England
forefathers
--
he
whose
picture
still
hung
upon
the
*NL*
wall
--
had
given
a
dead
man
's
silent
and
stern
reception
to
the
throng
*NL*
of
distinguished
guests
.
From
that
hour
of
evil
omen
until
the
*NL*
present
,
it
may
be
,
--
though
we
know
not
the
secret
of
his
heart
,
--
but
*NL*
it
may
be
that
no
wearier
and
sadder
man
had
ever
sunk
into
the
chair
*NL*
than
this
same
Judge
Pyncheon
,
whom
we
have
just
beheld
so
immitigably
*NL*
hard
and
resolute
.
Surely
,
it
must
have
been
at
no
slight
cost
that
he
*NL*
had
thus
fortified
his
soul
with
iron
.
Such
calmness
is
a
mightier
*NL*
effort
than
the
violence
of
weaker
men
.
And
there
was
yet
a
heavy
task
*NL*
for
him
to
do
.
Was
it
a
little
matter
--
a
trifle
to
be
prepared
for
in
*NL*
a
single
moment
,
and
to
be
rested
from
in
another
moment
,
--
that
he
must
*NL*
now
,
after
thirty
years
,
encounter
a
kinsman
risen
from
a
living
tomb
,
*NL*
and
wrench
a
secret
from
him
,
or
else
consign
him
to
a
living
tomb
*NL*
again
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
speak
?
''
asked
Hepzibah
,
looking
in
from
the
threshold
of
the
*NL*
parlor
;
for
she
imagined
that
the
Judge
had
uttered
some
sound
which
*NL*
she
was
anxious
to
interpret
as
a
relenting
impulse
.
``
I
thought
you
*NL*
called
me
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
''
gruffly
answered
Judge
Pyncheon
with
a
harsh
frown
,
while
his
*NL*
brow
grew
almost
a
black
purple
,
in
the
shadow
of
the
room
.
``
Why
*NL*
should
I
call
you
back
?
Time
flies
!
Bid
Clifford
come
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Judge
had
taken
his
watch
from
his
vest
pocket
and
now
held
it
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
measuring
the
interval
which
was
to
ensue
before
the
*NL*
appearance
of
Clifford
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XVI
Clifford
's
Chamber
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
NEVER
had
the
old
house
appeared
so
dismal
to
poor
Hepzibah
as
when
she
*NL*
departed
on
that
wretched
errand
.
There
was
a
strange
aspect
in
it
.
*NL*
As
she
trode
along
the
foot-worn
passages
,
and
opened
one
crazy
door
*NL*
after
another
,
and
ascended
the
creaking
staircase
,
she
gazed
wistfully
*NL*
and
fearfully
around
.
It
would
have
been
no
marvel
,
to
her
excited
*NL*
mind
,
if
,
behind
or
beside
her
,
there
had
been
the
rustle
of
dead
*NL*
people
's
garments
,
or
pale
visages
awaiting
her
on
the
landing-place
*NL*
above
.
Her
nerves
were
set
all
ajar
by
the
scene
of
passion
and
terror
*NL*
through
which
she
had
just
struggled
.
Her
colloquy
with
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
,
who
so
perfectly
represented
the
person
and
attributes
of
the
*NL*
founder
of
the
family
,
had
called
back
the
dreary
past
.
It
weighed
*NL*
upon
her
heart
.
Whatever
she
had
heard
,
from
legendary
aunts
and
*NL*
grandmothers
,
concerning
the
good
or
evil
fortunes
of
the
*NL*
Pyncheons
,
--
stories
which
had
heretofore
been
kept
warm
in
her
*NL*
remembrance
by
the
chimney-corner
glow
that
was
associated
with
*NL*
them
,
--
now
recurred
to
her
,
sombre
,
ghastly
,
cold
,
like
most
passages
*NL*
of
family
history
,
when
brooded
over
in
melancholy
mood
.
The
whole
*NL*
seemed
little
else
but
a
series
of
calamity
,
reproducing
itself
in
*NL*
successive
generations
,
with
one
general
hue
,
and
varying
in
little
,
*NL*
save
the
outline
.
But
Hepzibah
now
felt
as
if
the
Judge
,
and
Clifford
,
*NL*
and
herself
,
--
they
three
together
,
--
were
on
the
point
of
adding
another
*NL*
incident
to
the
annals
of
the
house
,
with
a
bolder
relief
of
wrong
and
*NL*
sorrow
,
which
would
cause
it
to
stand
out
from
all
the
rest
.
Thus
it
*NL*
is
that
the
grief
of
the
passing
moment
takes
upon
itself
an
*NL*
individuality
,
and
a
character
of
climax
,
which
it
is
destined
to
lose
*NL*
after
a
while
,
and
to
fade
into
the
dark
gray
tissue
common
to
the
*NL*
grave
or
glad
events
of
many
years
ago
.
It
is
but
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
comparatively
,
that
anything
looks
strange
or
startling
,
--
a
truth
that
*NL*
has
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Hepzibah
could
not
rid
herself
of
the
sense
of
something
*NL*
unprecedented
at
that
instant
passing
and
soon
to
be
accomplished
.
Her
*NL*
nerves
were
in
a
shake
.
Instinctively
she
paused
before
the
arched
*NL*
window
,
and
looked
out
upon
the
street
,
in
order
to
seize
its
permanent
*NL*
objects
with
her
mental
grasp
,
and
thus
to
steady
herself
from
the
reel
*NL*
and
vibration
which
affected
her
more
immediate
sphere
.
It
brought
her
*NL*
up
,
as
we
may
say
,
with
a
kind
of
shock
,
when
she
beheld
everything
*NL*
under
the
same
appearance
as
the
day
before
,
and
numberless
preceding
*NL*
days
,
except
for
the
difference
between
sunshine
and
sullen
storm
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
travelled
along
the
street
,
from
doorstep
to
doorstep
,
noting
the
*NL*
wet
sidewalks
,
with
here
and
there
a
puddle
in
hollows
that
had
been
*NL*
imperceptible
until
filled
with
water
.
She
screwed
her
dim
optics
to
*NL*
their
acutest
point
,
in
the
hope
of
making
out
,
with
greater
*NL*
distinctness
,
a
certain
window
,
where
she
half
saw
,
half
guessed
,
that
*NL*
a
tailor
's
seamstress
was
sitting
at
her
work
.
Hepzibah
flung
herself
*NL*
upon
that
unknown
woman
's
companionship
,
even
thus
far
off
.
Then
she
*NL*
was
attracted
by
a
chaise
rapidly
passing
,
and
watched
its
moist
and
*NL*
glistening
top
,
and
its
splashing
wheels
,
until
it
had
turned
the
*NL*
corner
,
and
refused
to
carry
any
further
her
idly
trifling
,
because
*NL*
appalled
and
overburdened
,
mind
.
When
the
vehicle
had
disappeared
,
she
*NL*
allowed
herself
still
another
loitering
moment
;
for
the
patched
figure
*NL*
of
good
Uncle
Venner
was
now
visible
,
coming
slowly
from
the
head
of
*NL*
the
street
downward
,
with
a
rheumatic
limp
,
because
the
east
wind
had
*NL*
got
into
his
joints
.
Hepzibah
wished
that
he
would
pass
yet
more
*NL*
slowly
,
and
befriend
her
shivering
solitude
a
little
longer
.
Anything
*NL*
that
would
take
her
out
of
the
grievous
present
,
and
interpose
human
*NL*
beings
betwixt
herself
and
what
was
nearest
to
her
,
--
whatever
would
*NL*
defer
for
an
instant
the
inevitable
errand
on
which
she
was
bound
,
--
all
*NL*
such
impediments
were
welcome
.
Next
to
the
lightest
heart
,
the
*NL*
heaviest
is
apt
to
be
most
playful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
had
little
hardihood
for
her
own
proper
pain
,
and
far
less
for
*NL*
what
she
must
inflict
on
Clifford
.
Of
so
slight
a
nature
,
and
so
*NL*
shattered
by
his
previous
calamities
,
it
could
not
well
be
short
of
*NL*
utter
ruin
to
bring
him
face
to
face
with
the
hard
,
relentless
man
who
*NL*
had
been
his
evil
destiny
through
life
.
Even
had
there
been
no
bitter
*NL*
recollections
,
nor
any
hostile
interest
now
at
stake
between
them
,
the
*NL*
mere
natural
repugnance
of
the
more
sensitive
system
to
the
massive
,
*NL*
weighty
,
and
unimpressible
one
,
must
,
in
itself
,
have
been
disastrous
*NL*
to
the
former
.
It
would
be
like
flinging
a
porcelain
vase
,
with
*NL*
already
a
crack
in
it
,
against
a
granite
column
.
Never
before
had
*NL*
Hepzibah
so
adequately
estimated
the
powerful
character
of
her
cousin
*NL*
Jaffrey
,
--
powerful
by
intellect
,
energy
of
will
,
the
long
habit
of
*NL*
acting
among
men
,
and
,
as
she
believed
,
by
his
unscrupulous
pursuit
of
*NL*
selfish
ends
through
evil
means
.
It
did
but
increase
the
difficulty
*NL*
that
Judge
Pyncheon
was
under
a
delusion
as
to
the
secret
which
he
*NL*
supposed
Clifford
to
possess
.
Men
of
his
strength
of
purpose
and
*NL*
customary
sagacity
,
if
they
chance
to
adopt
a
mistaken
opinion
in
*NL*
practical
matters
,
so
wedge
it
and
fasten
it
among
things
known
to
be
*NL*
true
,
that
to
wrench
it
out
of
their
minds
is
hardly
less
difficult
*NL*
than
pulling
up
an
oak
.
Thus
,
as
the
Judge
required
an
impossibility
*NL*
of
Clifford
,
the
latter
,
as
he
could
not
perform
it
,
must
needs
perish
.
*NL*
For
what
,
in
the
grasp
of
a
man
like
this
,
was
to
become
of
Clifford
's
*NL*
soft
poetic
nature
,
that
never
should
have
had
a
task
more
stubborn
*NL*
than
to
set
a
life
of
beautiful
enjoyment
to
the
flow
and
rhythm
of
*NL*
musical
cadences
!
Indeed
,
what
had
become
of
it
already
?
Broken
!
*NL*
Blighted
!
All
but
annihilated
!
Soon
to
be
wholly
so
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
,
the
thought
crossed
Hepzibah
's
mind
,
whether
Clifford
*NL*
might
not
really
have
such
knowledge
of
their
deceased
uncle
's
vanished
*NL*
estate
as
the
Judge
imputed
to
him
.
She
remembered
some
vague
*NL*
intimations
,
on
her
brother
's
part
,
which
--
if
the
supposition
were
not
*NL*
essentially
preposterous
--
might
have
been
so
interpreted
.
There
had
*NL*
been
schemes
of
travel
and
residence
abroad
,
day-dreams
of
brilliant
*NL*
life
at
home
,
and
splendid
castles
in
the
air
,
which
it
would
have
*NL*
required
boundless
wealth
to
build
and
realize
.
Had
this
wealth
been
*NL*
in
her
power
,
how
gladly
would
Hepzibah
have
bestowed
it
all
upon
her
*NL*
iron-hearted
kinsman
,
to
buy
for
Clifford
the
freedom
and
seclusion
of
*NL*
the
desolate
old
house
!
But
she
believed
that
her
brother
's
schemes
*NL*
were
as
destitute
of
actual
substance
and
purpose
as
a
child
's
pictures
*NL*
of
its
future
life
,
while
sitting
in
a
little
chair
by
its
mother
's
*NL*
knee
.
Clifford
had
none
but
shadowy
gold
at
his
command
;
and
it
was
*NL*
not
the
stuff
to
satisfy
Judge
Pyncheon
!
*NL*
*NL*
Was
there
no
help
in
their
extremity
?
It
seemed
strange
that
there
*NL*
should
be
none
,
with
a
city
round
about
her
.
It
would
be
so
easy
to
*NL*
throw
up
the
window
,
and
send
forth
a
shriek
,
at
the
strange
agony
of
*NL*
which
everybody
would
come
hastening
to
the
rescue
,
well
understanding
*NL*
it
to
be
the
cry
of
a
human
soul
,
at
some
dreadful
crisis
!
But
how
*NL*
wild
,
how
almost
laughable
,
the
fatality
,
--
and
yet
how
continually
it
*NL*
comes
to
pass
,
thought
Hepzibah
,
in
this
dull
delirium
of
a
*NL*
world
,
--
that
whosoever
,
and
with
however
kindly
a
purpose
,
should
come
*NL*
to
help
,
they
would
be
sure
to
help
the
strongest
side
!
Might
and
wrong
*NL*
combined
,
like
iron
magnetized
,
are
endowed
with
irresistible
*NL*
attraction
.
There
would
be
Judge
Pyncheon
,
--
a
person
eminent
in
the
*NL*
public
view
,
of
high
station
and
great
wealth
,
a
philanthropist
,
a
*NL*
member
of
Congress
and
of
the
church
,
and
intimately
associated
with
*NL*
whatever
else
bestows
good
name
,
--
so
imposing
,
in
these
advantageous
*NL*
lights
,
that
Hepzibah
herself
could
hardly
help
shrinking
from
her
own
*NL*
conclusions
as
to
his
hollow
integrity
.
The
Judge
,
on
one
side
!
And
*NL*
who
,
on
the
other
?
The
guilty
Clifford
!
Once
a
byword
!
Now
,
an
*NL*
indistinctly
remembered
ignominy
!
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
in
spite
of
this
perception
that
the
Judge
would
draw
all
*NL*
human
aid
to
his
own
behalf
,
Hepzibah
was
so
unaccustomed
to
act
for
*NL*
herself
,
that
the
least
word
of
counsel
would
have
swayed
her
to
any
*NL*
mode
of
action
.
Little
Phoebe
Pyncheon
would
at
once
have
lighted
up
*NL*
the
whole
scene
,
if
not
by
any
available
suggestion
,
yet
simply
by
the
*NL*
warm
vivacity
of
her
character
.
The
idea
of
the
artist
occurred
to
*NL*
Hepzibah
.
Young
and
unknown
,
mere
vagrant
adventurer
as
he
was
,
she
had
*NL*
been
conscious
of
a
force
in
Holgrave
which
might
well
adapt
him
to
be
*NL*
the
champion
of
a
crisis
.
With
this
thought
in
her
mind
,
she
unbolted
a
*NL*
door
,
cobwebbed
and
long
disused
,
but
which
had
served
as
a
former
*NL*
medium
of
communication
between
her
own
part
of
the
house
and
the
gable
*NL*
where
the
wandering
daguerreotypist
had
now
established
his
temporary
*NL*
home
.
He
was
not
there
.
A
book
,
face
downward
,
on
the
table
,
a
roll
of
*NL*
manuscript
,
a
half-written
sheet
,
a
newspaper
,
some
tools
of
his
*NL*
present
occupation
,
and
several
rejected
daguerreotypes
,
conveyed
an
*NL*
impression
as
if
he
were
close
at
hand
.
But
,
at
this
period
of
the
day
,
*NL*
as
Hepzibah
might
have
anticipated
,
the
artist
was
at
his
public
rooms
.
*NL*
With
an
impulse
of
idle
curiosity
,
that
flickered
among
her
heavy
*NL*
thoughts
,
she
looked
at
one
of
the
daguerreotypes
,
and
beheld
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
frowning
at
her
.
Fate
stared
her
in
the
face
.
She
turned
back
*NL*
from
her
fruitless
quest
,
with
a
heartsinking
sense
of
disappointment
.
*NL*
In
all
her
years
of
seclusion
,
she
had
never
felt
,
as
now
,
what
it
was
*NL*
to
be
alone
.
It
seemed
as
if
the
house
stood
in
a
desert
,
or
,
by
some
*NL*
spell
,
was
made
invisible
to
those
who
dwelt
around
,
or
passed
beside
*NL*
it
;
so
that
any
mode
of
misfortune
,
miserable
accident
,
or
crime
might
*NL*
happen
in
it
without
the
possibility
of
aid
.
In
her
grief
and
wounded
*NL*
pride
,
Hepzibah
had
spent
her
life
in
divesting
herself
of
friends
;
she
*NL*
had
wilfully
cast
off
the
support
which
God
has
ordained
his
creatures
*NL*
to
need
from
one
another
;
and
it
was
now
her
punishment
,
that
Clifford
*NL*
and
herself
would
fall
the
easier
victims
to
their
kindred
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Returning
to
the
arched
window
,
she
lifted
her
eyes
,
--
scowling
,
poor
,
*NL*
dim-sighted
Hepzibah
,
in
the
face
of
Heaven
!
--
and
strove
hard
to
send
*NL*
up
a
prayer
through
the
dense
gray
pavement
of
clouds
.
Those
mists
had
*NL*
gathered
,
as
if
to
symbolize
a
great
,
brooding
mass
of
human
trouble
,
*NL*
doubt
,
confusion
,
and
chill
indifference
,
between
earth
and
the
better
*NL*
regions
.
Her
faith
was
too
weak
;
the
prayer
too
heavy
to
be
thus
*NL*
uplifted
.
It
fell
back
,
a
lump
of
lead
,
upon
her
heart
.
It
smote
her
*NL*
with
the
wretched
conviction
that
Providence
intermeddled
not
in
these
*NL*
petty
wrongs
of
one
individual
to
his
fellow
,
nor
had
any
balm
for
*NL*
these
little
agonies
of
a
solitary
soul
;
but
shed
its
justice
,
and
its
*NL*
mercy
,
in
a
broad
,
sunlike
sweep
,
over
half
the
universe
at
once
.
Its
*NL*
vastness
made
it
nothing
.
But
Hepzibah
did
not
see
that
,
just
as
there
*NL*
comes
a
warm
sunbeam
into
every
cottage
window
,
so
comes
a
lovebeam
of
*NL*
God
's
care
and
pity
for
every
separate
need
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
finding
no
other
pretext
for
deferring
the
torture
that
she
*NL*
was
to
inflict
on
Clifford
,
--
her
reluctance
to
which
was
the
true
cause
*NL*
of
her
loitering
at
the
window
,
her
search
for
the
artist
,
and
even
her
*NL*
abortive
prayer
,
--
dreading
,
also
,
to
hear
the
stern
voice
of
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
from
below
stairs
,
chiding
her
delay
,
--
she
crept
slowly
,
a
*NL*
pale
,
grief-stricken
figure
,
a
dismal
shape
of
woman
,
with
almost
*NL*
torpid
limbs
,
slowly
to
her
brother
's
door
,
and
knocked
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
how
should
there
have
been
?
Her
hand
,
tremulous
with
the
shrinking
*NL*
purpose
which
directed
it
,
had
smitten
so
feebly
against
the
door
that
*NL*
the
sound
could
hardly
have
gone
inward
.
She
knocked
again
.
Still
no
*NL*
response
!
Nor
was
it
to
be
wondered
at
.
She
had
struck
with
the
entire
*NL*
force
of
her
heart
's
vibration
,
communicating
,
by
some
subtile
*NL*
magnetism
,
her
own
terror
to
the
summons
.
Clifford
would
turn
his
face
*NL*
to
the
pillow
,
and
cover
his
head
beneath
the
bedclothes
,
like
a
*NL*
startled
child
at
midnight
.
She
knocked
a
third
time
,
three
regular
*NL*
strokes
,
gentle
,
but
perfectly
distinct
,
and
with
meaning
in
them
;
for
,
*NL*
modulate
it
with
what
cautious
art
we
will
,
the
hand
can
not
help
*NL*
playing
some
tune
of
what
we
feel
upon
the
senseless
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clifford
returned
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clifford
!
Dear
brother
!
''
said
Hepzibah
.
``
Shall
I
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
or
three
times
,
and
more
,
Hepzibah
repeated
his
name
,
without
*NL*
result
;
till
,
thinking
her
brother
's
sleep
unwontedly
profound
,
she
*NL*
undid
the
door
,
and
entering
,
found
the
chamber
vacant
.
How
could
he
*NL*
have
come
forth
,
and
when
,
without
her
knowledge
?
Was
it
possible
*NL*
that
,
in
spite
of
the
stormy
day
,
and
worn
out
with
the
irksomeness
*NL*
within
doors
he
had
betaken
himself
to
his
customary
haunt
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
and
was
now
shivering
under
the
cheerless
shelter
of
the
*NL*
summer-house
?
She
hastily
threw
up
a
window
,
thrust
forth
her
turbaned
*NL*
head
and
the
half
of
her
gaunt
figure
,
and
searched
the
whole
garden
*NL*
through
,
as
completely
as
her
dim
vision
would
allow
.
She
could
see
*NL*
the
interior
of
the
summer-house
,
and
its
circular
seat
,
kept
moist
by
*NL*
the
droppings
of
the
roof
.
It
had
no
occupant
.
Clifford
was
not
*NL*
thereabouts
;
unless
,
indeed
,
he
had
crept
for
concealment
-LRB-
as
,
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
Hepzibah
fancied
might
be
the
case
-RRB-
into
a
great
,
wet
mass
of
*NL*
tangled
and
broad-leaved
shadow
,
where
the
squash-vines
were
clambering
*NL*
tumultuously
upon
an
old
wooden
framework
,
set
casually
aslant
against
*NL*
the
fence
.
This
could
not
be
,
however
;
he
was
not
there
;
for
,
while
*NL*
Hepzibah
was
looking
,
a
strange
grimalkin
stole
forth
from
the
very
*NL*
spot
,
and
picked
his
way
across
the
garden
.
Twice
he
paused
to
snuff
*NL*
the
air
,
and
then
anew
directed
his
course
towards
the
parlor
window
.
*NL*
Whether
it
was
only
on
account
of
the
stealthy
,
prying
manner
common
to
*NL*
the
race
,
or
that
this
cat
seemed
to
have
more
than
ordinary
mischief
*NL*
in
his
thoughts
,
the
old
gentlewoman
,
in
spite
of
her
much
perplexity
,
*NL*
felt
an
impulse
to
drive
the
animal
away
,
and
accordingly
flung
down
a
*NL*
window
stick
.
The
cat
stared
up
at
her
,
like
a
detected
thief
or
*NL*
murderer
,
and
,
the
next
instant
,
took
to
flight
.
No
other
living
*NL*
creature
was
visible
in
the
garden
.
Chanticleer
and
his
family
had
*NL*
either
not
left
their
roost
,
disheartened
by
the
interminable
rain
,
or
*NL*
had
done
the
next
wisest
thing
,
by
seasonably
returning
to
it
.
*NL*
Hepzibah
closed
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
where
was
Clifford
?
Could
it
be
that
,
aware
of
the
presence
of
his
*NL*
Evil
Destiny
,
he
had
crept
silently
down
the
staircase
,
while
the
Judge
*NL*
and
Hepzibah
stood
talking
in
the
shop
,
and
had
softly
undone
the
*NL*
fastenings
of
the
outer
door
,
and
made
his
escape
into
the
street
?
*NL*
With
that
thought
,
she
seemed
to
behold
his
gray
,
wrinkled
,
yet
*NL*
childlike
aspect
,
in
the
old-fashioned
garments
which
he
wore
about
the
*NL*
house
;
a
figure
such
as
one
sometimes
imagines
himself
to
be
,
with
the
*NL*
world
's
eye
upon
him
,
in
a
troubled
dream
.
This
figure
of
her
wretched
*NL*
brother
would
go
wandering
through
the
city
,
attracting
all
eyes
,
and
*NL*
everybody
's
wonder
and
repugnance
,
like
a
ghost
,
the
more
to
be
*NL*
shuddered
at
because
visible
at
noontide
.
To
incur
the
ridicule
of
the
*NL*
younger
crowd
,
that
knew
him
not
,
--
the
harsher
scorn
and
indignation
of
*NL*
a
few
old
men
,
who
might
recall
his
once
familiar
features
!
To
be
the
*NL*
sport
of
boys
,
who
,
when
old
enough
to
run
about
the
streets
,
have
no
*NL*
more
reverence
for
what
is
beautiful
and
holy
,
nor
pity
for
what
is
*NL*
sad
,
--
no
more
sense
of
sacred
misery
,
sanctifying
the
human
shape
in
*NL*
which
it
embodies
itself
,
--
than
if
Satan
were
the
father
of
them
all
!
*NL*
Goaded
by
their
taunts
,
their
loud
,
shrill
cries
,
and
cruel
*NL*
laughter
,
--
insulted
by
the
filth
of
the
public
ways
,
which
they
would
*NL*
fling
upon
him
,
--
or
,
as
it
might
well
be
,
distracted
by
the
mere
*NL*
strangeness
of
his
situation
,
though
nobody
should
afflict
him
with
so
*NL*
much
as
a
thoughtless
word
,
--
what
wonder
if
Clifford
were
to
break
into
*NL*
some
wild
extravagance
which
was
certain
to
be
interpreted
as
lunacy
?
*NL*
Thus
Judge
Pyncheon
's
fiendish
scheme
would
be
ready
accomplished
to
*NL*
his
hands
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Hepzibah
reflected
that
the
town
was
almost
completely
*NL*
water-girdled
.
The
wharves
stretched
out
towards
the
centre
of
the
*NL*
harbor
,
and
,
in
this
inclement
weather
,
were
deserted
by
the
ordinary
*NL*
throng
of
merchants
,
laborers
,
and
sea-faring
men
;
each
wharf
a
*NL*
solitude
,
with
the
vessels
moored
stem
and
stern
,
along
its
misty
*NL*
length
.
Should
her
brother
's
aimless
footsteps
stray
thitherward
,
and
*NL*
he
but
bend
,
one
moment
,
over
the
deep
,
black
tide
,
would
he
not
*NL*
bethink
himself
that
here
was
the
sure
refuge
within
his
reach
,
and
*NL*
that
,
with
a
single
step
,
or
the
slightest
overbalance
of
his
body
,
he
*NL*
might
be
forever
beyond
his
kinsman
's
gripe
?
Oh
,
the
temptation
!
To
*NL*
make
of
his
ponderous
sorrow
a
security
!
To
sink
,
with
its
leaden
*NL*
weight
upon
him
,
and
never
rise
again
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
horror
of
this
last
conception
was
too
much
for
Hepzibah
.
Even
*NL*
Jaffrey
Pyncheon
must
help
her
now
She
hastened
down
the
staircase
,
*NL*
shrieking
as
she
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clifford
is
gone
!
''
she
cried
.
``
I
can
not
find
my
brother
.
Help
,
*NL*
Jaffrey
Pyncheon
!
Some
harm
will
happen
to
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
threw
open
the
parlor-door
.
But
,
what
with
the
shade
of
branches
*NL*
across
the
windows
,
and
the
smoke-blackened
ceiling
,
and
the
dark
*NL*
oak-panelling
of
the
walls
,
there
was
hardly
so
much
daylight
in
the
*NL*
room
that
Hepzibah
's
imperfect
sight
could
accurately
distinguish
the
*NL*
Judge
's
figure
.
She
was
certain
,
however
,
that
she
saw
him
sitting
in
*NL*
the
ancestral
arm-chair
,
near
the
centre
of
the
floor
,
with
his
face
*NL*
somewhat
averted
,
and
looking
towards
a
window
.
So
firm
and
quiet
is
*NL*
the
nervous
system
of
such
men
as
Judge
Pyncheon
,
that
he
had
perhaps
*NL*
stirred
not
more
than
once
since
her
departure
,
but
,
in
the
hard
*NL*
composure
of
his
temperament
,
retained
the
position
into
which
accident
*NL*
had
thrown
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
Jaffrey
,
''
cried
Hepzibah
impatiently
,
as
she
turned
from
*NL*
the
parlor-door
to
search
other
rooms
,
``
my
brother
is
not
in
his
*NL*
chamber
!
You
must
help
me
seek
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Judge
Pyncheon
was
not
the
man
to
let
himself
be
startled
from
an
*NL*
easy-chair
with
haste
ill-befitting
either
the
dignity
of
his
character
*NL*
or
his
broad
personal
basis
,
by
the
alarm
of
an
hysteric
woman
.
Yet
,
*NL*
considering
his
own
interest
in
the
matter
,
he
might
have
bestirred
*NL*
himself
with
a
little
more
alacrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
me
,
Jaffrey
Pyncheon
?
''
screamed
Hepzibah
,
as
she
again
*NL*
approached
the
parlor-door
,
after
an
ineffectual
search
elsewhere
.
*NL*
``
Clifford
is
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
,
on
the
threshold
of
the
parlor
,
emerging
from
within
,
*NL*
appeared
Clifford
himself
!
His
face
was
preternaturally
pale
;
so
deadly
*NL*
white
,
indeed
,
that
,
through
all
the
glimmering
indistinctness
of
the
*NL*
passageway
,
Hepzibah
could
discern
his
features
,
as
if
a
light
fell
on
*NL*
them
alone
.
Their
vivid
and
wild
expression
seemed
likewise
sufficient
*NL*
to
illuminate
them
;
it
was
an
expression
of
scorn
and
mockery
,
*NL*
coinciding
with
the
emotions
indicated
by
his
gesture
.
As
Clifford
*NL*
stood
on
the
threshold
,
partly
turning
back
,
he
pointed
his
finger
*NL*
within
the
parlor
,
and
shook
it
slowly
as
though
he
would
have
*NL*
summoned
,
not
Hepzibah
alone
,
but
the
whole
world
,
to
gaze
at
some
*NL*
object
inconceivably
ridiculous
.
This
action
,
so
ill-timed
and
*NL*
extravagant
,
--
accompanied
,
too
,
with
a
look
that
showed
more
like
joy
*NL*
than
any
other
kind
of
excitement
,
--
compelled
Hepzibah
to
dread
that
*NL*
her
stern
kinsman
's
ominous
visit
had
driven
her
poor
brother
to
*NL*
absolute
insanity
.
Nor
could
she
otherwise
account
for
the
Judge
's
*NL*
quiescent
mood
than
by
supposing
him
craftily
on
the
watch
,
while
*NL*
Clifford
developed
these
symptoms
of
a
distracted
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
,
Clifford
!
''
whispered
his
sister
,
raising
her
hand
to
impress
*NL*
caution
.
``
Oh
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
be
quiet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
be
quiet
!
What
can
he
do
better
?
''
answered
Clifford
,
with
a
*NL*
still
wilder
gesture
,
pointing
into
the
room
which
he
had
just
quitted
.
*NL*
``
As
for
us
,
Hepzibah
,
we
can
dance
now
!
--
we
can
sing
,
laugh
,
play
,
do
*NL*
what
we
will
!
The
weight
is
gone
,
Hepzibah
!
It
is
gone
off
this
weary
*NL*
old
world
,
and
we
may
be
as
light-hearted
as
little
Phoebe
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
in
accordance
with
his
words
,
he
began
to
laugh
,
still
pointing
*NL*
his
finger
at
the
object
,
invisible
to
Hepzibah
,
within
the
parlor
.
*NL*
She
was
seized
with
a
sudden
intuition
of
some
horrible
thing
.
She
*NL*
thrust
herself
past
Clifford
,
and
disappeared
into
the
room
;
but
almost
*NL*
immediately
returned
,
with
a
cry
choking
in
her
throat
.
Gazing
at
her
*NL*
brother
with
an
affrighted
glance
of
inquiry
,
she
beheld
him
all
in
a
*NL*
tremor
and
a
quake
,
from
head
to
foot
,
while
,
amid
these
commoted
*NL*
elements
of
passion
or
alarm
,
still
flickered
his
gusty
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
what
is
to
become
of
us
?
''
gasped
Hepzibah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
Clifford
in
a
tone
of
brief
decision
,
most
unlike
what
was
*NL*
usual
with
him
.
``
We
stay
here
too
long
!
Let
us
leave
the
old
house
to
*NL*
our
cousin
Jaffrey
!
He
will
take
good
care
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
now
noticed
that
Clifford
had
on
a
cloak
,
--
a
garment
of
long
*NL*
ago
,
--
in
which
he
had
constantly
muffled
himself
during
these
days
of
*NL*
easterly
storm
.
He
beckoned
with
his
hand
,
and
intimated
,
so
far
as
*NL*
she
could
comprehend
him
,
his
purpose
that
they
should
go
together
from
*NL*
the
house
.
There
are
chaotic
,
blind
,
or
drunken
moments
,
in
the
lives
*NL*
of
persons
who
lack
real
force
of
character
,
--
moments
of
test
,
in
which
*NL*
courage
would
most
assert
itself
,
--
but
where
these
individuals
,
if
left
*NL*
to
themselves
,
stagger
aimlessly
along
,
or
follow
implicitly
whatever
*NL*
guidance
may
befall
them
,
even
if
it
be
a
child
's
.
No
matter
how
*NL*
preposterous
or
insane
,
a
purpose
is
a
Godsend
to
them
.
Hepzibah
had
*NL*
reached
this
point
.
Unaccustomed
to
action
or
responsibility
,
--
full
of
*NL*
horror
at
what
she
had
seen
,
and
afraid
to
inquire
,
or
almost
to
*NL*
imagine
,
how
it
had
come
to
pass
,
--
affrighted
at
the
fatality
which
*NL*
seemed
to
pursue
her
brother
,
--
stupefied
by
the
dim
,
thick
,
stifling
*NL*
atmosphere
of
dread
which
filled
the
house
as
with
a
death-smell
,
and
*NL*
obliterated
all
definiteness
of
thought
,
--
she
yielded
without
a
*NL*
question
,
and
on
the
instant
,
to
the
will
which
Clifford
expressed
.
*NL*
For
herself
,
she
was
like
a
person
in
a
dream
,
when
the
will
always
*NL*
sleeps
.
Clifford
,
ordinarily
so
destitute
of
this
faculty
,
had
found
*NL*
it
in
the
tension
of
the
crisis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
delay
so
?
''
cried
he
sharply
.
``
Put
on
your
cloak
and
hood
,
*NL*
or
whatever
it
pleases
you
to
wear
!
No
matter
what
;
you
can
not
look
*NL*
beautiful
nor
brilliant
,
my
poor
Hepzibah
!
Take
your
purse
,
with
money
*NL*
in
it
,
and
come
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hepzibah
obeyed
these
instructions
,
as
if
nothing
else
were
to
be
done
*NL*
or
thought
of
.
She
began
to
wonder
,
it
is
true
,
why
she
did
not
wake
*NL*
up
,
and
at
what
still
more
intolerable
pitch
of
dizzy
trouble
her
*NL*
spirit
would
struggle
out
of
the
maze
,
and
make
her
conscious
that
*NL*
nothing
of
all
this
had
actually
happened
.
Of
course
it
was
not
real
;
*NL*
no
such
black
,
easterly
day
as
this
had
yet
begun
to
be
;
Judge
Pyncheon
*NL*
had
not
talked
with
,
her
.
Clifford
had
not
laughed
,
pointed
,
beckoned
*NL*
her
away
with
him
;
but
she
had
merely
been
afflicted
--
as
lonely
*NL*
sleepers
often
are
--
with
a
great
deal
of
unreasonable
misery
,
in
a
*NL*
morning
dream
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
--
now
--
I
shall
certainly
awake
!
''
thought
Hepzibah
,
as
she
went
to
*NL*
and
fro
,
making
her
little
preparations
.
``
I
can
bear
it
no
longer
I
*NL*
must
wake
up
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
came
not
,
that
awakening
moment
!
It
came
not
,
even
when
,
just
*NL*
before
they
left
the
house
,
Clifford
stole
to
the
parlor-door
,
and
made
*NL*
a
parting
obeisance
to
the
sole
occupant
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
absurd
figure
the
old
fellow
cuts
now
!
''
whispered
he
to
*NL*
Hepzibah
.
``
Just
when
he
fancied
he
had
me
completely
under
his
thumb
!
*NL*
Come
,
come
;
make
haste
!
or
he
will
start
up
,
like
Giant
Despair
in
*NL*
pursuit
of
Christian
and
Hopeful
,
and
catch
us
yet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
passed
into
the
street
,
Clifford
directed
Hepzibah
's
attention
*NL*
to
something
on
one
of
the
posts
of
the
front
door
.
It
was
merely
the
*NL*
initials
of
his
own
name
,
which
,
with
somewhat
of
his
characteristic
*NL*
grace
about
the
forms
of
the
letters
,
he
had
cut
there
when
a
boy
.
The
*NL*
brother
and
sister
departed
,
and
left
Judge
Pyncheon
sitting
in
the
old
*NL*
home
of
his
forefathers
,
all
by
himself
;
so
heavy
and
lumpish
that
we
*NL*
can
liken
him
to
nothing
better
than
a
defunct
nightmare
,
which
had
*NL*
perished
in
the
midst
of
its
wickedness
,
and
left
its
flabby
corpse
on
*NL*
the
breast
of
the
tormented
one
,
to
be
gotten
rid
of
as
it
might
!

XVII
The
Flight
of
Two
Owls
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SUMMER
as
it
was
,
the
east
wind
set
poor
Hepzibah
's
few
remaining
teeth
*NL*
chattering
in
her
head
,
as
she
and
Clifford
faced
it
,
on
their
way
up
*NL*
Pyncheon
Street
,
and
towards
the
centre
of
the
town
.
Not
merely
was
it
*NL*
the
shiver
which
this
pitiless
blast
brought
to
her
frame
-LRB-
although
her
*NL*
feet
and
hands
,
especially
,
had
never
seemed
so
death-a-cold
as
now
-RRB-
,
*NL*
but
there
was
a
moral
sensation
,
mingling
itself
with
the
physical
*NL*
chill
,
and
causing
her
to
shake
more
in
spirit
than
in
body
.
The
*NL*
world
's
broad
,
bleak
atmosphere
was
all
so
comfortless
!
Such
,
indeed
,
*NL*
is
the
impression
which
it
makes
on
every
new
adventurer
,
even
if
he
*NL*
plunge
into
it
while
the
warmest
tide
of
life
is
bubbling
through
his
*NL*
veins
.
What
,
then
,
must
it
have
been
to
Hepzibah
and
Clifford
,
--
so
*NL*
time-stricken
as
they
were
,
yet
so
like
children
in
their
*NL*
inexperience
,
--
as
they
left
the
doorstep
,
and
passed
from
beneath
the
*NL*
wide
shelter
of
the
Pyncheon
Elm
!
They
were
wandering
all
abroad
,
on
*NL*
precisely
such
a
pilgrimage
as
a
child
often
meditates
,
to
the
world
's
*NL*
end
,
with
perhaps
a
sixpence
and
a
biscuit
in
his
pocket
.
In
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
mind
,
there
was
the
wretched
consciousness
of
being
adrift
.
*NL*
She
had
lost
the
faculty
of
self-guidance
;
but
,
in
view
of
the
*NL*
difficulties
around
her
,
felt
it
hardly
worth
an
effort
to
regain
it
,
*NL*
and
was
,
moreover
,
incapable
of
making
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
proceeded
on
their
strange
expedition
,
she
now
and
then
cast
a
*NL*
look
sidelong
at
Clifford
,
and
could
not
but
observe
that
he
was
*NL*
possessed
and
swayed
by
a
powerful
excitement
.
It
was
this
,
indeed
,
*NL*
that
gave
him
the
control
which
he
had
at
once
,
and
so
irresistibly
,
*NL*
established
over
his
movements
.
It
not
a
little
resembled
the
*NL*
exhilaration
of
wine
.
Or
,
it
might
more
fancifully
be
compared
to
a
*NL*
joyous
piece
of
music
,
played
with
wild
vivacity
,
but
upon
a
disordered
*NL*
instrument
.
As
the
cracked
jarring
note
might
always
be
heard
,
and
as
*NL*
it
jarred
loudest
amidst
the
loftiest
exultation
of
the
melody
,
so
was
*NL*
there
a
continual
quake
through
Clifford
,
causing
him
most
to
quiver
*NL*
while
he
wore
a
triumphant
smile
,
and
seemed
almost
under
a
necessity
*NL*
to
skip
in
his
gait
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
met
few
people
abroad
,
even
on
passing
from
the
retired
*NL*
neighborhood
of
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
into
what
was
ordinarily
*NL*
the
more
thronged
and
busier
portion
of
the
town
.
Glistening
*NL*
sidewalks
,
with
little
pools
of
rain
,
here
and
there
,
along
their
*NL*
unequal
surface
;
umbrellas
displayed
ostentatiously
in
the
*NL*
shop-windows
,
as
if
the
life
of
trade
had
concentrated
itself
in
that
*NL*
one
article
;
wet
leaves
of
the
horse-chestnut
or
elm-trees
,
torn
off
*NL*
untimely
by
the
blast
and
scattered
along
the
public
way
;
an
unsightly
,
*NL*
accumulation
of
mud
in
the
middle
of
the
street
,
which
perversely
grew
*NL*
the
more
unclean
for
its
long
and
laborious
washing
,
--
these
were
the
*NL*
more
definable
points
of
a
very
sombre
picture
.
In
the
way
of
movement
*NL*
and
human
life
,
there
was
the
hasty
rattle
of
a
cab
or
coach
,
its
*NL*
driver
protected
by
a
waterproof
cap
over
his
head
and
shoulders
;
the
*NL*
forlorn
figure
of
an
old
man
,
who
seemed
to
have
crept
out
of
some
*NL*
subterranean
sewer
,
and
was
stooping
along
the
kennel
,
and
poking
the
*NL*
wet
rubbish
with
a
stick
,
in
quest
of
rusty
nails
;
a
merchant
or
two
,
*NL*
at
the
door
of
the
post-office
,
together
with
an
editor
and
a
*NL*
miscellaneous
politician
,
awaiting
a
dilatory
mail
;
a
few
visages
of
*NL*
retired
sea-captains
at
the
window
of
an
insurance
office
,
looking
out
*NL*
vacantly
at
the
vacant
street
,
blaspheming
at
the
weather
,
and
fretting
*NL*
at
the
dearth
as
well
of
public
news
as
local
gossip
.
What
a
*NL*
treasure-trove
to
these
venerable
quidnuncs
,
could
they
have
guessed
*NL*
the
secret
which
Hepzibah
and
Clifford
were
carrying
along
with
them
!
*NL*
But
their
two
figures
attracted
hardly
so
much
notice
as
that
of
a
*NL*
young
girl
,
who
passed
at
the
same
instant
,
and
happened
to
raise
her
*NL*
skirt
a
trifle
too
high
above
her
ankles
.
Had
it
been
a
sunny
and
*NL*
cheerful
day
,
they
could
hardly
have
gone
through
the
streets
without
*NL*
making
themselves
obnoxious
to
remark
.
Now
,
probably
,
they
were
felt
*NL*
to
be
in
keeping
with
the
dismal
and
bitter
weather
,
and
therefore
did
*NL*
not
stand
out
in
strong
relief
,
as
if
the
sun
were
shining
on
them
,
but
*NL*
melted
into
the
gray
gloom
and
were
forgotten
as
soon
as
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Hepzibah
!
Could
she
have
understood
this
fact
,
it
would
have
*NL*
brought
her
some
little
comfort
;
for
,
to
all
her
other
*NL*
troubles
,
--
strange
to
say
!
--
there
was
added
the
womanish
and
*NL*
old-maiden-like
misery
arising
from
a
sense
of
unseemliness
in
her
*NL*
attire
.
Thus
,
she
was
fain
to
shrink
deeper
into
herself
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
as
if
in
the
hope
of
making
people
suppose
that
here
was
only
a
cloak
*NL*
and
hood
,
threadbare
and
woefully
faded
,
taking
an
airing
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
the
storm
,
without
any
wearer
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
on
,
the
feeling
of
indistinctness
and
unreality
kept
dimly
*NL*
hovering
round
about
her
,
and
so
diffusing
itself
into
her
system
that
*NL*
one
of
her
hands
was
hardly
palpable
to
the
touch
of
the
other
.
Any
*NL*
certainty
would
have
been
preferable
to
this
.
She
whispered
to
*NL*
herself
,
again
and
again
,
``
Am
I
awake
?
--
Am
I
awake
?
''
and
sometimes
*NL*
exposed
her
face
to
the
chill
spatter
of
the
wind
,
for
the
sake
of
its
*NL*
rude
assurance
that
she
was
.
Whether
it
was
Clifford
's
purpose
,
or
*NL*
only
chance
,
had
led
them
thither
,
they
now
found
themselves
passing
*NL*
beneath
the
arched
entrance
of
a
large
structure
of
gray
stone
.
*NL*
Within
,
there
was
a
spacious
breadth
,
and
an
airy
height
from
floor
to
*NL*
roof
,
now
partially
filled
with
smoke
and
steam
,
which
eddied
*NL*
voluminously
upward
and
formed
a
mimic
cloud-region
over
their
heads
.
*NL*
A
train
of
cars
was
just
ready
for
a
start
;
the
locomotive
was
fretting
*NL*
and
fuming
,
like
a
steed
impatient
for
a
headlong
rush
;
and
the
bell
*NL*
rang
out
its
hasty
peal
,
so
well
expressing
the
brief
summons
which
*NL*
life
vouchsafes
to
us
in
its
hurried
career
.
Without
question
or
*NL*
delay
,
--
with
the
irresistible
decision
,
if
not
rather
to
be
called
*NL*
recklessness
,
which
had
so
strangely
taken
possession
of
him
,
and
*NL*
through
him
of
Hepzibah
,
--
Clifford
impelled
her
towards
the
cars
,
and
*NL*
assisted
her
to
enter
.
The
signal
was
given
;
the
engine
puffed
forth
*NL*
its
short
,
quick
breaths
;
the
train
began
its
movement
;
and
,
along
with
*NL*
a
hundred
other
passengers
,
these
two
unwonted
travellers
sped
onward
*NL*
like
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
therefore
,
and
after
so
long
estrangement
from
everything
that
*NL*
the
world
acted
or
enjoyed
,
they
had
been
drawn
into
the
great
current
*NL*
of
human
life
,
and
were
swept
away
with
it
,
as
by
the
suction
of
fate
*NL*
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
haunted
with
the
idea
that
not
one
of
the
past
incidents
,
*NL*
inclusive
of
Judge
Pyncheon
's
visit
,
could
be
real
,
the
recluse
of
the
*NL*
Seven
Gables
murmured
in
her
brother
's
ear
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clifford
!
Clifford
!
Is
not
this
a
dream
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dream
,
Hepzibah
!
''
repeated
he
,
almost
laughing
in
her
face
.
``
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
I
have
never
been
awake
before
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
looking
from
the
window
,
they
could
see
the
world
racing
*NL*
past
them
.
At
one
moment
,
they
were
rattling
through
a
solitude
;
the
*NL*
next
,
a
village
had
grown
up
around
them
;
a
few
breaths
more
,
and
it
*NL*
had
vanished
,
as
if
swallowed
by
an
earthquake
.
The
spires
of
*NL*
meeting-houses
seemed
set
adrift
from
their
foundations
;
the
*NL*
broad-based
hills
glided
away
.
Everything
was
unfixed
from
its
*NL*
age-long
rest
,
and
moving
at
whirlwind
speed
in
a
direction
opposite
to
*NL*
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
the
car
there
was
the
usual
interior
life
of
the
railroad
,
*NL*
offering
little
to
the
observation
of
other
passengers
,
but
full
of
*NL*
novelty
for
this
pair
of
strangely
enfranchised
prisoners
.
It
was
*NL*
novelty
enough
,
indeed
,
that
there
were
fifty
human
beings
in
close
*NL*
relation
with
them
,
under
one
long
and
narrow
roof
,
and
drawn
onward
by
*NL*
the
same
mighty
influence
that
had
taken
their
two
selves
into
its
*NL*
grasp
.
It
seemed
marvellous
how
all
these
people
could
remain
so
*NL*
quietly
in
their
seats
,
while
so
much
noisy
strength
was
at
work
in
*NL*
their
behalf
.
Some
,
with
tickets
in
their
hats
-LRB-
long
travellers
these
,
*NL*
before
whom
lay
a
hundred
miles
of
railroad
-RRB-
,
had
plunged
into
the
*NL*
English
scenery
and
adventures
of
pamphlet
novels
,
and
were
keeping
*NL*
company
with
dukes
and
earls
.
Others
,
whose
briefer
span
forbade
their
*NL*
devoting
themselves
to
studies
so
abstruse
,
beguiled
the
little
tedium
*NL*
of
the
way
with
penny-papers
.
A
party
of
girls
,
and
one
young
man
,
on
*NL*
opposite
sides
of
the
car
,
found
huge
amusement
in
a
game
of
ball
.
*NL*
They
tossed
it
to
and
fro
,
with
peals
of
laughter
that
might
be
*NL*
measured
by
mile-lengths
;
for
,
faster
than
the
nimble
ball
could
fly
,
*NL*
the
merry
players
fled
unconsciously
along
,
leaving
the
trail
of
their
*NL*
mirth
afar
behind
,
and
ending
their
game
under
another
sky
than
had
*NL*
witnessed
its
commencement
.
Boys
,
with
apples
,
cakes
,
candy
,
and
rolls
*NL*
of
variously
tinctured
lozenges
,
--
merchandise
that
reminded
Hepzibah
of
*NL*
her
deserted
shop
,
--
appeared
at
each
momentary
stopping-place
,
doing
up
*NL*
their
business
in
a
hurry
,
or
breaking
it
short
off
,
lest
the
market
*NL*
should
ravish
them
away
with
it
.
New
people
continually
entered
.
Old
*NL*
acquaintances
--
for
such
they
soon
grew
to
be
,
in
this
rapid
current
of
*NL*
affairs
--
continually
departed
.
Here
and
there
,
amid
the
rumble
and
the
*NL*
tumult
,
sat
one
asleep
.
Sleep
;
sport
;
business
;
graver
or
lighter
*NL*
study
;
and
the
common
and
inevitable
movement
onward
!
It
was
life
*NL*
itself
!
*NL*
*NL*
Clifford
's
naturally
poignant
sympathies
were
all
aroused
.
He
caught
*NL*
the
color
of
what
was
passing
about
him
,
and
threw
it
back
more
vividly
*NL*
than
he
received
it
,
but
mixed
,
nevertheless
,
with
a
lurid
and
*NL*
portentous
hue
.
Hepzibah
,
on
the
other
hand
,
felt
herself
more
apart
*NL*
from
human
kind
than
even
in
the
seclusion
which
she
had
just
quitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
happy
,
Hepzibah
!
''
said
Clifford
apart
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
approach
.
``
You
are
thinking
of
that
dismal
old
house
,
and
of
Cousin
*NL*
Jaffrey
''
--
here
came
the
quake
through
him
,
--
``
and
of
Cousin
Jaffrey
*NL*
sitting
there
,
all
by
himself
!
Take
my
advice
,
--
follow
my
example
,
--
and
*NL*
let
such
things
slip
aside
.
Here
we
are
,
in
the
world
,
Hepzibah
!
--
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
life
!
--
in
the
throng
of
our
fellow
beings
!
Let
you
and
I
*NL*
be
happy
!
As
happy
as
that
youth
and
those
pretty
girls
,
at
their
game
*NL*
of
ball
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
--
''
thought
Hepzibah
,
bitterly
conscious
,
at
the
word
,
of
her
*NL*
dull
and
heavy
heart
,
with
the
frozen
pain
in
it
,
--
``
happy
.
He
is
mad
*NL*
already
;
and
,
if
I
could
once
feel
myself
broad
awake
,
I
should
go
mad
*NL*
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
a
fixed
idea
be
madness
,
she
was
perhaps
not
remote
from
it
.
Fast
*NL*
and
far
as
they
had
rattled
and
clattered
along
the
iron
track
,
they
*NL*
might
just
as
well
,
as
regarded
Hepzibah
's
mental
images
,
have
been
*NL*
passing
up
and
down
Pyncheon
Street
.
With
miles
and
miles
of
varied
*NL*
scenery
between
,
there
was
no
scene
for
her
save
the
seven
old
*NL*
gable-peaks
,
with
their
moss
,
and
the
tuft
of
weeds
in
one
of
the
*NL*
angles
,
and
the
shop-window
,
and
a
customer
shaking
the
door
,
and
*NL*
compelling
the
little
bell
to
jingle
fiercely
,
but
without
disturbing
*NL*
Judge
Pyncheon
!
This
one
old
house
was
everywhere
!
It
transported
its
*NL*
great
,
lumbering
bulk
with
more
than
railroad
speed
,
and
set
itself
*NL*
phlegmatically
down
on
whatever
spot
she
glanced
at
.
The
quality
of
*NL*
Hepzibah
's
mind
was
too
unmalleable
to
take
new
impressions
so
readily
*NL*
as
Clifford
's
.
He
had
a
winged
nature
;
she
was
rather
of
the
vegetable
*NL*
kind
,
and
could
hardly
be
kept
long
alive
,
if
drawn
up
by
the
roots
.
*NL*
Thus
it
happened
that
the
relation
heretofore
existing
between
her
*NL*
brother
and
herself
was
changed
.
At
home
,
she
was
his
guardian
;
here
,
*NL*
Clifford
had
become
hers
,
and
seemed
to
comprehend
whatever
belonged
to
*NL*
their
new
position
with
a
singular
rapidity
of
intelligence
.
He
had
*NL*
been
startled
into
manhood
and
intellectual
vigor
;
or
,
at
least
,
into
a
*NL*
condition
that
resembled
them
,
though
it
might
be
both
diseased
and
*NL*
transitory
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conductor
now
applied
for
their
tickets
;
and
Clifford
,
who
had
made
*NL*
himself
the
purse-bearer
,
put
a
bank-note
into
his
hand
,
as
he
had
*NL*
observed
others
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
lady
and
yourself
?
''
asked
the
conductor
.
``
And
how
far
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
far
as
that
will
carry
us
,
''
said
Clifford
.
``
It
is
no
great
matter
.
*NL*
We
are
riding
for
pleasure
merely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
choose
a
strange
day
for
it
,
sir
!
''
remarked
a
gimlet-eyed
old
*NL*
gentleman
on
the
other
side
of
the
car
,
looking
at
Clifford
and
his
*NL*
companion
,
as
if
curious
to
make
them
out
.
``
The
best
chance
of
*NL*
pleasure
,
in
an
easterly
rain
,
I
take
it
,
is
in
a
man
's
own
house
,
with
*NL*
a
nice
little
fire
in
the
chimney
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
precisely
agree
with
you
,
''
said
Clifford
,
courteously
bowing
*NL*
to
the
old
gentleman
,
and
at
once
taking
up
the
clew
of
conversation
*NL*
which
the
latter
had
proffered
.
``
It
had
just
occurred
to
me
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
that
this
admirable
invention
of
the
railroad
--
with
the
vast
*NL*
and
inevitable
improvements
to
be
looked
for
,
both
as
to
speed
and
*NL*
convenience
--
is
destined
to
do
away
with
those
stale
ideas
of
home
and
*NL*
fireside
,
and
substitute
something
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
common-sense
,
''
asked
the
old
gentleman
rather
testily
,
*NL*
``
what
can
be
better
for
a
man
than
his
own
parlor
and
chimney-corner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
things
have
not
the
merit
which
many
good
people
attribute
to
*NL*
them
,
''
replied
Clifford
.
``
They
may
be
said
,
in
few
and
pithy
words
,
to
*NL*
have
ill
served
a
poor
purpose
.
My
impression
is
,
that
our
wonderfully
*NL*
increased
and
still
increasing
facilities
of
locomotion
are
destined
to
*NL*
bring
us
around
again
to
the
nomadic
state
.
You
are
aware
,
my
dear
*NL*
sir
,
--
you
must
have
observed
it
in
your
own
experience
,
--
that
all
human
*NL*
progress
is
in
a
circle
;
or
,
to
use
a
more
accurate
and
beautiful
*NL*
figure
,
in
an
ascending
spiral
curve
.
While
we
fancy
ourselves
going
*NL*
straight
forward
,
and
attaining
,
at
every
step
,
an
entirely
new
*NL*
position
of
affairs
,
we
do
actually
return
to
something
long
ago
tried
*NL*
and
abandoned
,
but
which
we
now
find
etherealized
,
refined
,
and
*NL*
perfected
to
its
ideal
.
The
past
is
but
a
coarse
and
sensual
prophecy
*NL*
of
the
present
and
the
future
.
To
apply
this
truth
to
the
topic
now
*NL*
under
discussion
.
In
the
early
epochs
of
our
race
,
men
dwelt
in
*NL*
temporary
huts
,
of
bowers
of
branches
,
as
easily
constructed
as
a
*NL*
bird
's
-
nest
,
and
which
they
built
,
--
if
it
should
be
called
building
,
*NL*
when
such
sweet
homes
of
a
summer
solstice
rather
grew
than
were
made
*NL*
with
hands
,
--
which
Nature
,
we
will
say
,
assisted
them
to
rear
where
*NL*
fruit
abounded
,
where
fish
and
game
were
plentiful
,
or
,
most
*NL*
especially
,
where
the
sense
of
beauty
was
to
be
gratified
by
a
lovelier
*NL*
shade
than
elsewhere
,
and
a
more
exquisite
arrangement
of
lake
,
wood
,
*NL*
and
hill
.
This
life
possessed
a
charm
which
,
ever
since
man
quitted
*NL*
it
,
has
vanished
from
existence
.
And
it
typified
something
better
than
*NL*
itself
.
It
had
its
drawbacks
;
such
as
hunger
and
thirst
,
inclement
*NL*
weather
,
hot
sunshine
,
and
weary
and
foot-blistering
marches
over
*NL*
barren
and
ugly
tracts
,
that
lay
between
the
sites
desirable
for
their
*NL*
fertility
and
beauty
.
But
in
our
ascending
spiral
,
we
escape
all
this
.
*NL*
These
railroads
--
could
but
the
whistle
be
made
musical
,
and
the
rumble
*NL*
and
the
jar
got
rid
of
--
are
positively
the
greatest
blessing
that
the
*NL*
ages
have
wrought
out
for
us
.
They
give
us
wings
;
they
annihilate
the
*NL*
toil
and
dust
of
pilgrimage
;
they
spiritualize
travel
!
Transition
being
*NL*
so
facile
,
what
can
be
any
man
's
inducement
to
tarry
in
one
spot
?
Why
,
*NL*
therefore
,
should
he
build
a
more
cumbrous
habitation
than
can
readily
*NL*
be
carried
off
with
him
?
Why
should
he
make
himself
a
prisoner
for
life
*NL*
in
brick
,
and
stone
,
and
old
worm-eaten
timber
,
when
he
may
just
as
*NL*
easily
dwell
,
in
one
sense
,
nowhere
,
--
in
a
better
sense
,
wherever
the
*NL*
fit
and
beautiful
shall
offer
him
a
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clifford
's
countenance
glowed
,
as
he
divulged
this
theory
;
a
youthful
*NL*
character
shone
out
from
within
,
converting
the
wrinkles
and
pallid
*NL*
duskiness
of
age
into
an
almost
transparent
mask
.
The
merry
girls
let
*NL*
their
ball
drop
upon
the
floor
,
and
gazed
at
him
.
They
said
to
*NL*
themselves
,
perhaps
,
that
,
before
his
hair
was
gray
and
the
crow
's
-
feet
*NL*
tracked
his
temples
,
this
now
decaying
man
must
have
stamped
the
*NL*
impress
of
his
features
on
many
a
woman
's
heart
.
But
,
alas
!
no
woman
's
*NL*
eye
had
seen
his
face
while
it
was
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
scarcely
call
it
an
improved
state
of
things
,
''
observed
*NL*
Clifford
's
new
acquaintance
,
``
to
live
everywhere
and
nowhere
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
not
?
''
exclaimed
Clifford
,
with
singular
energy
.
``
It
is
as
*NL*
clear
to
me
as
sunshine
,
--
were
there
any
in
the
sky
,
--
that
the
greatest
*NL*
possible
stumbling-blocks
in
the
path
of
human
happiness
and
*NL*
improvement
are
these
heaps
of
bricks
and
stones
,
consolidated
with
*NL*
mortar
,
or
hewn
timber
,
fastened
together
with
spike-nails
,
which
men
*NL*
painfully
contrive
for
their
own
torment
,
and
call
them
house
and
home
!
*NL*
The
soul
needs
air
;
a
wide
sweep
and
frequent
change
of
it
.
Morbid
*NL*
influences
,
in
a
thousand-fold
variety
,
gather
about
hearths
,
and
*NL*
pollute
the
life
of
households
.
There
is
no
such
unwholesome
*NL*
atmosphere
as
that
of
an
old
home
,
rendered
poisonous
by
one
's
defunct
*NL*
forefathers
and
relatives
.
I
speak
of
what
I
know
.
There
is
a
certain
*NL*
house
within
my
familiar
recollection
,
--
one
of
those
peaked-gable
*NL*
-LRB-
there
are
seven
of
them
-RRB-
,
projecting-storied
edifices
,
such
as
you
*NL*
occasionally
see
in
our
older
towns
,
--
a
rusty
,
crazy
,
creaky
,
*NL*
dry-rotted
,
dingy
,
dark
,
and
miserable
old
dungeon
,
with
an
arched
*NL*
window
over
the
porch
,
and
a
little
shop-door
on
one
side
,
and
a
great
,
*NL*
melancholy
elm
before
it
!
Now
,
sir
,
whenever
my
thoughts
recur
to
this
*NL*
seven-gabled
mansion
-LRB-
the
fact
is
so
very
curious
that
I
must
needs
*NL*
mention
it
-RRB-
,
immediately
I
have
a
vision
or
image
of
an
elderly
man
,
of
*NL*
remarkably
stern
countenance
,
sitting
in
an
oaken
elbow-chair
,
dead
,
*NL*
stone-dead
,
with
an
ugly
flow
of
blood
upon
his
shirt-bosom
!
Dead
,
but
*NL*
with
open
eyes
!
He
taints
the
whole
house
,
as
I
remember
it
.
I
could
*NL*
never
flourish
there
,
nor
be
happy
,
nor
do
nor
enjoy
what
God
meant
me
*NL*
to
do
and
enjoy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
darkened
,
and
seemed
to
contract
,
and
shrivel
itself
up
,
and
*NL*
wither
into
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
sir
!
''
he
repeated
.
``
I
could
never
draw
cheerful
breath
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
not
,
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
eyeing
Clifford
*NL*
earnestly
,
and
rather
apprehensively
.
``
I
should
conceive
not
,
sir
,
*NL*
with
that
notion
in
your
head
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
not
,
''
continued
Clifford
;
``
and
it
were
a
relief
to
me
if
that
*NL*
house
could
be
torn
down
,
or
burnt
up
,
and
so
the
earth
be
rid
of
it
,
*NL*
and
grass
be
sown
abundantly
over
its
foundation
.
Not
that
I
should
*NL*
ever
visit
its
site
again
!
for
,
sir
,
the
farther
I
get
away
from
it
,
*NL*
the
more
does
the
joy
,
the
lightsome
freshness
,
the
heart-leap
,
the
*NL*
intellectual
dance
,
the
youth
,
in
short
,
--
yes
,
my
youth
,
my
youth
!
--
the
*NL*
more
does
it
come
back
to
me
.
No
longer
ago
than
this
morning
,
I
was
*NL*
old
.
I
remember
looking
in
the
glass
,
and
wondering
at
my
own
gray
*NL*
hair
,
and
the
wrinkles
,
many
and
deep
,
right
across
my
brow
,
and
the
*NL*
furrows
down
my
cheeks
,
and
the
prodigious
trampling
of
crow
's
-
feet
*NL*
about
my
temples
!
It
was
too
soon
!
I
could
not
bear
it
!
Age
had
no
*NL*
right
to
come
!
I
had
not
lived
!
But
now
do
I
look
old
?
If
so
,
my
*NL*
aspect
belies
me
strangely
;
for
--
a
great
weight
being
off
my
mind
--
I
*NL*
feel
in
the
very
heyday
of
my
youth
,
with
the
world
and
my
best
days
*NL*
before
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
you
may
find
it
so
,
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
who
seemed
rather
*NL*
embarrassed
,
and
desirous
of
avoiding
the
observation
which
Clifford
's
*NL*
wild
talk
drew
on
them
both
.
``
You
have
my
best
wishes
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
dear
Clifford
,
be
quiet
!
''
whispered
his
sister
.
*NL*
``
They
think
you
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
yourself
,
Hepzibah
!
''
returned
her
brother
.
``
No
matter
what
*NL*
they
think
!
I
am
not
mad
.
For
the
first
time
in
thirty
years
my
*NL*
thoughts
gush
up
and
find
words
ready
for
them
.
I
must
talk
,
and
I
*NL*
will
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
again
towards
the
old
gentleman
,
and
renewed
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
is
my
firm
belief
and
hope
that
these
*NL*
terms
of
roof
and
hearth-stone
,
which
have
so
long
been
held
to
embody
*NL*
something
sacred
,
are
soon
to
pass
out
of
men
's
daily
use
,
and
be
*NL*
forgotten
.
Just
imagine
,
for
a
moment
,
how
much
of
human
evil
will
*NL*
crumble
away
,
with
this
one
change
!
What
we
call
real
estate
--
the
solid
*NL*
ground
to
build
a
house
on
--
is
the
broad
foundation
on
which
nearly
all
*NL*
the
guilt
of
this
world
rests
.
A
man
will
commit
almost
any
wrong
,
--
he
*NL*
will
heap
up
an
immense
pile
of
wickedness
,
as
hard
as
granite
,
and
*NL*
which
will
weigh
as
heavily
upon
his
soul
,
to
eternal
ages
,
--
only
to
*NL*
build
a
great
,
gloomy
,
dark-chambered
mansion
,
for
himself
to
die
in
,
*NL*
and
for
his
posterity
to
be
miserable
in
.
He
lays
his
own
dead
corpse
*NL*
beneath
the
underpinning
,
as
one
may
say
,
and
hangs
his
frowning
*NL*
picture
on
the
wall
,
and
,
after
thus
converting
himself
into
an
evil
*NL*
destiny
,
expects
his
remotest
great-grandchildren
to
be
happy
there
.
I
*NL*
do
not
speak
wildly
.
I
have
just
such
a
house
in
my
mind
's
eye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
sir
,
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
getting
anxious
to
drop
the
*NL*
subject
,
``
you
are
not
to
blame
for
leaving
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Within
the
lifetime
of
the
child
already
born
,
''
Clifford
went
on
,
``
all
*NL*
this
will
be
done
away
.
The
world
is
growing
too
ethereal
and
*NL*
spiritual
to
bear
these
enormities
a
great
while
longer
.
To
me
,
*NL*
though
,
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
,
I
have
lived
chiefly
in
*NL*
retirement
,
and
know
less
of
such
things
than
most
men
,
--
even
to
me
,
*NL*
the
harbingers
of
a
better
era
are
unmistakable
.
Mesmerism
,
now
!
Will
*NL*
that
effect
nothing
,
think
you
,
towards
purging
away
the
grossness
out
*NL*
of
human
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
a
humbug
!
''
growled
the
old
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
rapping
spirits
,
that
little
Phoebe
told
us
of
,
the
other
day
,
''
*NL*
said
Clifford
,
--
``
what
are
these
but
the
messengers
of
the
spiritual
*NL*
world
,
knocking
at
the
door
of
substance
?
And
it
shall
be
flung
wide
*NL*
open
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
humbug
,
again
!
''
cried
the
old
gentleman
,
growing
more
and
more
testy
*NL*
at
these
glimpses
of
Clifford
's
metaphysics
.
``
I
should
like
to
rap
*NL*
with
a
good
stick
on
the
empty
pates
of
the
dolts
who
circulate
such
*NL*
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
is
electricity
,
--
the
demon
,
the
angel
,
the
mighty
physical
*NL*
power
,
the
all-pervading
intelligence
!
''
exclaimed
Clifford
.
``
Is
that
a
*NL*
humbug
,
too
?
Is
it
a
fact
--
or
have
I
dreamt
it
--
that
,
by
means
of
*NL*
electricity
,
the
world
of
matter
has
become
a
great
nerve
,
vibrating
*NL*
thousands
of
miles
in
a
breathless
point
of
time
?
Rather
,
the
round
*NL*
globe
is
a
vast
head
,
a
brain
,
instinct
with
intelligence
!
Or
,
shall
*NL*
we
say
,
it
is
itself
a
thought
,
nothing
but
thought
,
and
no
longer
the
*NL*
substance
which
we
deemed
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
mean
the
telegraph
,
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
glancing
his
eye
*NL*
toward
its
wire
,
alongside
the
rail-track
,
``
it
is
an
excellent
*NL*
thing
,
--
that
is
,
of
course
,
if
the
speculators
in
cotton
and
politics
*NL*
do
n't
get
possession
of
it
.
A
great
thing
,
indeed
,
sir
,
particularly
*NL*
as
regards
the
detection
of
bank-robbers
and
murderers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
like
it
,
in
that
point
of
view
,
''
replied
Clifford
.
``
A
*NL*
bank-robber
,
and
what
you
call
a
murderer
,
likewise
,
has
his
rights
,
*NL*
which
men
of
enlightened
humanity
and
conscience
should
regard
in
so
*NL*
much
the
more
liberal
spirit
,
because
the
bulk
of
society
is
prone
to
*NL*
controvert
their
existence
.
An
almost
spiritual
medium
,
like
the
*NL*
electric
telegraph
,
should
be
consecrated
to
high
,
deep
,
joyful
,
and
*NL*
holy
missions
.
Lovers
,
day
by
,
day
--
hour
by
hour
,
if
so
often
moved
to
*NL*
do
it
,
--
might
send
their
heart-throbs
from
Maine
to
Florida
,
with
some
*NL*
such
words
as
these
'
I
love
you
forever
!
'
--
`
My
heart
runs
over
with
*NL*
love
!
'
--
'
I
love
you
more
than
I
can
!
'
and
,
again
,
at
the
next
message
*NL*
'
I
have
lived
an
hour
longer
,
and
love
you
twice
as
much
!
'
Or
,
when
a
*NL*
good
man
has
departed
,
his
distant
friend
should
be
conscious
of
an
*NL*
electric
thrill
,
as
from
the
world
of
happy
spirits
,
telling
him
`
Your
*NL*
dear
friend
is
in
bliss
!
'
Or
,
to
an
absent
husband
,
should
come
tidings
*NL*
thus
`
An
immortal
being
,
of
whom
you
are
the
father
,
has
this
moment
*NL*
come
from
God
!
'
and
immediately
its
little
voice
would
seem
to
have
*NL*
reached
so
far
,
and
to
be
echoing
in
his
heart
.
But
for
these
poor
*NL*
rogues
,
the
bank-robbers
,
--
who
,
after
all
,
are
about
as
honest
as
nine
*NL*
people
in
ten
,
except
that
they
disregard
certain
formalities
,
and
*NL*
prefer
to
transact
business
at
midnight
rather
than
`
Change-hours
,
--
and
*NL*
for
these
murderers
,
as
you
phrase
it
,
who
are
often
excusable
in
the
*NL*
motives
of
their
deed
,
and
deserve
to
be
ranked
among
public
*NL*
benefactors
,
if
we
consider
only
its
result
,
--
for
unfortunate
*NL*
individuals
like
these
,
I
really
can
not
applaud
the
enlistment
of
an
*NL*
immaterial
and
miraculous
power
in
the
universal
world-hunt
at
their
*NL*
heels
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
,
hey
?
''
cried
the
old
gentleman
,
with
a
hard
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Positively
,
no
!
''
answered
Clifford
.
``
It
puts
them
too
miserably
at
*NL*
disadvantage
.
For
example
,
sir
,
in
a
dark
,
low
,
cross-beamed
,
panelled
*NL*
room
of
an
old
house
,
let
us
suppose
a
dead
man
,
sitting
in
an
*NL*
arm-chair
,
with
a
blood-stain
on
his
shirt-bosom
,
--
and
let
us
add
to
*NL*
our
hypothesis
another
man
,
issuing
from
the
house
,
which
he
feels
to
*NL*
be
over-filled
with
the
dead
man
's
presence
,
--
and
let
us
lastly
imagine
*NL*
him
fleeing
,
Heaven
knows
whither
,
at
the
speed
of
a
hurricane
,
by
*NL*
railroad
!
Now
,
sir
,
if
the
fugitive
alight
in
some
distant
town
,
and
*NL*
find
all
the
people
babbling
about
that
self-same
dead
man
,
whom
he
has
*NL*
fled
so
far
to
avoid
the
sight
and
thought
of
,
will
you
not
allow
that
*NL*
his
natural
rights
have
been
infringed
?
He
has
been
deprived
of
his
*NL*
city
of
refuge
,
and
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
has
suffered
infinite
wrong
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
strange
man
;
Sir
!
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
bringing
his
*NL*
gimlet-eye
to
a
point
on
Clifford
,
as
if
determined
to
bore
right
into
*NL*
him
.
``
I
ca
n't
see
through
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'll
be
bound
you
ca
n't
!
''
cried
Clifford
,
laughing
.
``
And
yet
,
my
*NL*
dear
sir
,
I
am
as
transparent
as
the
water
of
Maule
's
well
!
But
come
,
*NL*
Hepzibah
!
We
have
flown
far
enough
for
once
.
Let
us
alight
,
as
the
*NL*
birds
do
,
and
perch
ourselves
on
the
nearest
twig
,
and
consult
wither
*NL*
we
shall
fly
next
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
,
as
it
happened
,
the
train
reached
a
solitary
way-station
.
*NL*
Taking
advantage
of
the
brief
pause
,
Clifford
left
the
car
,
and
drew
*NL*
Hepzibah
along
with
him
.
A
moment
afterwards
,
the
train
--
with
all
the
*NL*
life
of
its
interior
,
amid
which
Clifford
had
made
himself
so
*NL*
conspicuous
an
object
--
was
gliding
away
in
the
distance
,
and
rapidly
*NL*
lessening
to
a
point
which
,
in
another
moment
,
vanished
.
The
world
had
*NL*
fled
away
from
these
two
wanderers
.
They
gazed
drearily
about
them
.
*NL*
At
a
little
distance
stood
a
wooden
church
,
black
with
age
,
and
in
a
*NL*
dismal
state
of
ruin
and
decay
,
with
broken
windows
,
a
great
rift
*NL*
through
the
main
body
of
the
edifice
,
and
a
rafter
dangling
from
the
*NL*
top
of
the
square
tower
.
Farther
off
was
a
farm-house
,
in
the
old
*NL*
style
,
as
venerably
black
as
the
church
,
with
a
roof
sloping
downward
*NL*
from
the
three-story
peak
,
to
within
a
man
's
height
of
the
ground
.
It
*NL*
seemed
uninhabited
.
There
were
the
relics
of
a
wood-pile
,
indeed
,
near
*NL*
the
door
,
but
with
grass
sprouting
up
among
the
chips
and
scattered
*NL*
logs
.
The
small
rain-drops
came
down
aslant
;
the
wind
was
not
*NL*
turbulent
,
but
sullen
,
and
full
of
chilly
moisture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clifford
shivered
from
head
to
foot
.
The
wild
effervescence
of
his
*NL*
mood
--
which
had
so
readily
supplied
thoughts
,
fantasies
,
and
a
strange
*NL*
aptitude
of
words
,
and
impelled
him
to
talk
from
the
mere
necessity
of
*NL*
giving
vent
to
this
bubbling-up
gush
of
ideas
had
entirely
subsided
.
A
*NL*
powerful
excitement
had
given
him
energy
and
vivacity
.
Its
operation
*NL*
over
,
he
forthwith
began
to
sink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
take
the
lead
now
,
Hepzibah
!
''
murmured
he
,
with
a
torpid
and
*NL*
reluctant
utterance
.
``
Do
with
me
as
you
will
!
''
She
knelt
down
upon
the
*NL*
platform
where
they
were
standing
and
lifted
her
clasped
hands
to
the
*NL*
sky
.
The
dull
,
gray
weight
of
clouds
made
it
invisible
;
but
it
was
no
*NL*
hour
for
disbelief
,
--
no
juncture
this
to
question
that
there
was
a
sky
*NL*
above
,
and
an
Almighty
Father
looking
from
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
God
!
''
--
ejaculated
poor
,
gaunt
Hepzibah
,
--
then
paused
a
moment
,
to
*NL*
consider
what
her
prayer
should
be
,
--
``
O
God
,
--
our
Father
,
--
are
we
not
*NL*
thy
children
?
Have
mercy
on
us
!

XVIII
Governor
Pyncheon
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
JUDGE
PYNCHEON
,
while
his
two
relatives
have
fled
away
with
such
*NL*
ill-considered
haste
,
still
sits
in
the
old
parlor
,
keeping
house
,
as
*NL*
the
familiar
phrase
is
,
in
the
absence
of
its
ordinary
occupants
.
To
*NL*
him
,
and
to
the
venerable
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
does
our
story
now
*NL*
betake
itself
,
like
an
owl
,
bewildered
in
the
daylight
,
and
hastening
*NL*
back
to
his
hollow
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Judge
has
not
shifted
his
position
for
a
long
while
now
.
He
has
*NL*
not
stirred
hand
or
foot
,
nor
withdrawn
his
eyes
so
much
as
a
*NL*
hair
's
-
breadth
from
their
fixed
gaze
towards
the
corner
of
the
room
,
*NL*
since
the
footsteps
of
Hepzibah
and
Clifford
creaked
along
the
passage
,
*NL*
and
the
outer
door
was
closed
cautiously
behind
their
exit
.
He
holds
*NL*
his
watch
in
his
left
hand
,
but
clutched
in
such
a
manner
that
you
*NL*
can
not
see
the
dial-plate
.
How
profound
a
fit
of
meditation
!
Or
,
*NL*
supposing
him
asleep
,
how
infantile
a
quietude
of
conscience
,
and
what
*NL*
wholesome
order
in
the
gastric
region
,
are
betokened
by
slumber
so
*NL*
entirely
undisturbed
with
starts
,
cramp
,
twitches
,
muttered
dreamtalk
,
*NL*
trumpet-blasts
through
the
nasal
organ
,
or
any
slightest
irregularity
*NL*
of
breath
!
You
must
hold
your
own
breath
,
to
satisfy
yourself
whether
*NL*
he
breathes
at
all
.
It
is
quite
inaudible
.
You
hear
the
ticking
of
*NL*
his
watch
;
his
breath
you
do
not
hear
.
A
most
refreshing
slumber
,
*NL*
doubtless
!
And
yet
,
the
Judge
can
not
be
asleep
.
His
eyes
are
open
!
A
*NL*
veteran
politician
,
such
as
he
,
would
never
fall
asleep
with
wide-open
*NL*
eyes
,
lest
some
enemy
or
mischief-maker
,
taking
him
thus
at
unawares
,
*NL*
should
peep
through
these
windows
into
his
consciousness
,
and
make
*NL*
strange
discoveries
among
the
reminiscences
,
projects
,
hopes
,
*NL*
apprehensions
,
weaknesses
,
and
strong
points
,
which
he
has
heretofore
*NL*
shared
with
nobody
.
A
cautious
man
is
proverbially
said
to
sleep
with
*NL*
one
eye
open
.
That
may
be
wisdom
.
But
not
with
both
;
for
this
were
*NL*
heedlessness
!
No
,
no
!
Judge
Pyncheon
can
not
be
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
odd
,
however
,
that
a
gentleman
so
burdened
with
engagements
,
--
and
*NL*
noted
,
too
,
for
punctuality
,
--
should
linger
thus
in
an
old
lonely
*NL*
mansion
,
which
he
has
never
seemed
very
fond
of
visiting
.
The
oaken
*NL*
chair
,
to
be
sure
,
may
tempt
him
with
its
roominess
.
It
is
,
indeed
,
a
*NL*
spacious
,
and
,
allowing
for
the
rude
age
that
fashioned
it
,
a
*NL*
moderately
easy
seat
,
with
capacity
enough
,
at
all
events
,
and
offering
*NL*
no
restraint
to
the
Judge
's
breadth
of
beam
.
A
bigger
man
might
find
*NL*
ample
accommodation
in
it
.
His
ancestor
,
now
pictured
upon
the
wall
,
*NL*
with
all
his
English
beef
about
him
,
used
hardly
to
present
a
front
*NL*
extending
from
elbow
to
elbow
of
this
chair
,
or
a
base
that
would
cover
*NL*
its
whole
cushion
.
But
there
are
better
chairs
than
this
,
--
mahogany
,
*NL*
black
walnut
,
rosewood
,
spring-seated
and
damask-cushioned
,
with
varied
*NL*
slopes
,
and
innumerable
artifices
to
make
them
easy
,
and
obviate
the
*NL*
irksomeness
of
too
tame
an
ease
,
--
a
score
of
such
might
be
at
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
service
.
Yes
!
in
a
score
of
drawing-rooms
he
would
be
more
*NL*
than
welcome
.
Mamma
would
advance
to
meet
him
,
with
outstretched
hand
;
*NL*
the
virgin
daughter
,
elderly
as
he
has
now
got
to
be
,
--
an
old
widower
,
*NL*
as
he
smilingly
describes
himself
,
--
would
shake
up
the
cushion
for
the
*NL*
Judge
,
and
do
her
pretty
utmost
to
make
him
comfortable
.
For
the
Judge
*NL*
is
a
prosperous
man
.
He
cherishes
his
schemes
,
moreover
,
like
other
*NL*
people
,
and
reasonably
brighter
than
most
others
;
or
did
so
,
at
least
,
*NL*
as
he
lay
abed
this
morning
,
in
an
agreeable
half-drowse
,
planning
the
*NL*
business
of
the
day
,
and
speculating
on
the
probabilities
of
the
next
*NL*
fifteen
years
.
With
his
firm
health
,
and
the
little
inroad
that
age
*NL*
has
made
upon
him
,
fifteen
years
or
twenty
--
yes
,
or
perhaps
*NL*
five-and-twenty
!
--
are
no
more
than
he
may
fairly
call
his
own
.
*NL*
Five-and-twenty
years
for
the
enjoyment
of
his
real
estate
in
town
and
*NL*
country
,
his
railroad
,
bank
,
and
insurance
shares
,
his
United
States
*NL*
stock
,
--
his
wealth
,
in
short
,
however
invested
,
now
in
possession
,
or
*NL*
soon
to
be
acquired
;
together
with
the
public
honors
that
have
fallen
*NL*
upon
him
,
and
the
weightier
ones
that
are
yet
to
fall
!
It
is
good
!
It
*NL*
is
excellent
!
It
is
enough
!
*NL*
*NL*
Still
lingering
in
the
old
chair
!
If
the
Judge
has
a
little
time
to
*NL*
throw
away
,
why
does
not
he
visit
the
insurance
office
,
as
is
his
*NL*
frequent
custom
,
and
sit
awhile
in
one
of
their
leathern-cushioned
*NL*
arm-chairs
,
listening
to
the
gossip
of
the
day
,
and
dropping
some
*NL*
deeply
designed
chance-word
,
which
will
be
certain
to
become
the
gossip
*NL*
of
to-morrow
.
And
have
not
the
bank
directors
a
meeting
at
which
it
*NL*
was
the
Judge
's
purpose
to
be
present
,
and
his
office
to
preside
?
*NL*
Indeed
they
have
;
and
the
hour
is
noted
on
a
card
,
which
is
,
or
ought
*NL*
to
be
,
in
Judge
Pyncheon
's
right
vest-pocket
.
Let
him
go
thither
,
and
*NL*
loll
at
ease
upon
his
moneybags
!
He
has
lounged
long
enough
in
the
old
*NL*
chair
!
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
to
have
been
such
a
busy
day
.
In
the
first
place
,
the
*NL*
interview
with
Clifford
.
Half
an
hour
,
by
the
Judge
's
reckoning
,
was
*NL*
to
suffice
for
that
;
it
would
probably
be
less
,
but
--
taking
into
*NL*
consideration
that
Hepzibah
was
first
to
be
dealt
with
,
and
that
these
*NL*
women
are
apt
to
make
many
words
where
a
few
would
do
much
better
--
it
*NL*
might
be
safest
to
allow
half
an
hour
.
Half
an
hour
?
Why
,
Judge
,
it
is
*NL*
already
two
hours
,
by
your
own
undeviatingly
accurate
chronometer
.
*NL*
Glance
your
eye
down
at
it
and
see
!
Ah
;
he
will
not
give
himself
the
*NL*
trouble
either
to
bend
his
head
,
or
elevate
his
hand
,
so
as
to
bring
*NL*
the
faithful
time-keeper
within
his
range
of
vision
!
Time
,
all
at
once
,
*NL*
appears
to
have
become
a
matter
of
no
moment
with
the
Judge
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
has
he
forgotten
all
the
other
items
of
his
memoranda
?
Clifford
's
*NL*
affair
arranged
,
he
was
to
meet
a
State
Street
broker
,
who
has
*NL*
undertaken
to
procure
a
heavy
percentage
,
and
the
best
of
paper
,
for
a
*NL*
few
loose
thousands
which
the
Judge
happens
to
have
by
him
,
uninvested
.
*NL*
The
wrinkled
note-shaver
will
have
taken
his
railroad
trip
in
vain
.
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
,
in
the
street
next
to
this
,
there
was
to
be
an
*NL*
auction
of
real
estate
,
including
a
portion
of
the
old
Pyncheon
*NL*
property
,
originally
belonging
to
Maule
's
garden
ground
.
It
has
been
*NL*
alienated
from
the
Pyncheons
these
four-score
years
;
but
the
Judge
had
*NL*
kept
it
in
his
eye
,
and
had
set
his
heart
on
reannexing
it
to
the
small
*NL*
demesne
still
left
around
the
Seven
Gables
;
and
now
,
during
this
odd
*NL*
fit
of
oblivion
,
the
fatal
hammer
must
have
fallen
,
and
transferred
our
*NL*
ancient
patrimony
to
some
alien
possessor
.
Possibly
,
indeed
,
the
sale
*NL*
may
have
been
postponed
till
fairer
weather
.
If
so
,
will
the
Judge
*NL*
make
it
convenient
to
be
present
,
and
favor
the
auctioneer
with
his
*NL*
bid
,
On
the
proximate
occasion
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
affair
was
to
buy
a
horse
for
his
own
driving
.
The
one
*NL*
heretofore
his
favorite
stumbled
,
this
very
morning
,
on
the
road
to
*NL*
town
,
and
must
be
at
once
discarded
.
Judge
Pyncheon
's
neck
is
too
*NL*
precious
to
be
risked
on
such
a
contingency
as
a
stumbling
steed
.
*NL*
Should
all
the
above
business
be
seasonably
got
through
with
,
he
might
*NL*
attend
the
meeting
of
a
charitable
society
;
the
very
name
of
which
,
*NL*
however
,
in
the
multiplicity
of
his
benevolence
,
is
quite
forgotten
;
so
*NL*
that
this
engagement
may
pass
unfulfilled
,
and
no
great
harm
done
.
And
*NL*
if
he
have
time
,
amid
the
press
of
more
urgent
matters
,
he
must
take
*NL*
measures
for
the
renewal
of
Mrs.
Pyncheon
's
tombstone
,
which
,
the
*NL*
sexton
tells
him
,
has
fallen
on
its
marble
face
,
and
is
cracked
quite
*NL*
in
twain
.
She
was
a
praiseworthy
woman
enough
,
thinks
the
Judge
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
her
nervousness
,
and
the
tears
that
she
was
so
oozy
with
,
and
*NL*
her
foolish
behavior
about
the
coffee
;
and
as
she
took
her
departure
so
*NL*
seasonably
,
he
will
not
grudge
the
second
tombstone
.
It
is
better
,
at
*NL*
least
,
than
if
she
had
never
needed
any
!
The
next
item
on
his
list
was
*NL*
to
give
orders
for
some
fruit-trees
,
of
a
rare
variety
,
to
be
*NL*
deliverable
at
his
country-seat
in
the
ensuing
autumn
.
Yes
,
buy
them
,
*NL*
by
all
means
;
and
may
the
peaches
be
luscious
in
your
mouth
,
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
!
After
this
comes
something
more
important
.
A
committee
of
*NL*
his
political
party
has
besought
him
for
a
hundred
or
two
of
dollars
,
*NL*
in
addition
to
his
previous
disbursements
,
towards
carrying
on
the
fall
*NL*
campaign
.
The
Judge
is
a
patriot
;
the
fate
of
the
country
is
staked
on
*NL*
the
November
election
;
and
besides
,
as
will
be
shadowed
forth
in
*NL*
another
paragraph
,
he
has
no
trifling
stake
of
his
own
in
the
same
*NL*
great
game
.
He
will
do
what
the
committee
asks
;
nay
,
he
will
be
*NL*
liberal
beyond
their
expectations
;
they
shall
have
a
check
for
five
*NL*
hundred
dollars
,
and
more
anon
,
if
it
be
needed
.
What
next
?
A
decayed
*NL*
widow
,
whose
husband
was
Judge
Pyncheon
's
early
friend
,
has
laid
her
*NL*
case
of
destitution
before
him
,
in
a
very
moving
letter
.
She
and
her
*NL*
fair
daughter
have
scarcely
bread
to
eat
.
He
partly
intends
to
call
on
*NL*
her
to-day
,
--
perhaps
so
--
perhaps
not
,
--
accordingly
as
he
may
happen
to
*NL*
have
leisure
,
and
a
small
bank-note
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
business
,
which
,
however
,
he
puts
no
great
weight
on
-LRB-
it
is
*NL*
well
,
you
know
,
to
be
heedful
,
but
not
over-anxious
,
as
respects
one
's
*NL*
personal
health
-RRB-
,
--
another
business
,
then
,
was
to
consult
his
family
*NL*
physician
.
About
what
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
?
Why
,
it
is
rather
difficult
*NL*
to
describe
the
symptoms
.
A
mere
dimness
of
sight
and
dizziness
of
*NL*
brain
,
was
it
?
--
or
disagreeable
choking
,
or
stifling
,
or
gurgling
,
or
*NL*
bubbling
,
in
the
region
of
the
thorax
,
as
the
anatomists
say
?
--
or
was
*NL*
it
a
pretty
severe
throbbing
and
kicking
of
the
heart
,
rather
*NL*
creditable
to
him
than
otherwise
,
as
showing
that
the
organ
had
not
*NL*
been
left
out
of
the
Judge
's
physical
contrivance
?
No
matter
what
it
*NL*
was
.
The
doctor
probably
would
smile
at
the
statement
of
such
trifles
*NL*
to
his
professional
ear
;
the
Judge
would
smile
in
his
turn
;
and
meeting
*NL*
one
another
's
eyes
,
they
would
enjoy
a
hearty
laugh
together
!
But
a
fig
*NL*
for
medical
advice
.
The
Judge
will
never
need
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pray
,
pray
,
Judge
Pyncheon
,
look
at
your
watch
,
Now
!
What
--
not
a
*NL*
glance
!
It
is
within
ten
minutes
of
the
dinner
hour
!
It
surely
can
not
*NL*
have
slipped
your
memory
that
the
dinner
of
to-day
is
to
be
the
most
*NL*
important
,
in
its
consequences
,
of
all
the
dinners
you
ever
ate
.
Yes
,
*NL*
precisely
the
most
important
;
although
,
in
the
course
of
your
somewhat
*NL*
eminent
career
,
you
have
been
placed
high
towards
the
head
of
the
*NL*
table
,
at
splendid
banquets
,
and
have
poured
out
your
festive
eloquence
*NL*
to
ears
yet
echoing
with
Webster
's
mighty
organ-tones
.
No
public
*NL*
dinner
this
,
however
.
It
is
merely
a
gathering
of
some
dozen
or
so
of
*NL*
friends
from
several
districts
of
the
State
;
men
of
distinguished
*NL*
character
and
influence
,
assembling
,
almost
casually
,
at
the
house
of
a
*NL*
common
friend
,
likewise
distinguished
,
who
will
make
them
welcome
to
a
*NL*
little
better
than
his
ordinary
fare
.
Nothing
in
the
way
of
French
*NL*
cookery
,
but
an
excellent
dinner
,
nevertheless
.
Real
turtle
,
we
*NL*
understand
,
and
salmon
,
tautog
,
canvas-backs
,
pig
,
English
mutton
,
good
*NL*
roast
beef
,
or
dainties
of
that
serious
kind
,
fit
for
substantial
*NL*
country
gentlemen
,
as
these
honorable
persons
mostly
are
.
The
*NL*
delicacies
of
the
season
,
in
short
,
and
flavored
by
a
brand
of
old
*NL*
Madeira
which
has
been
the
pride
of
many
seasons
.
It
is
the
Juno
*NL*
brand
;
a
glorious
wine
,
fragrant
,
and
full
of
gentle
might
;
a
*NL*
bottled-up
happiness
,
put
by
for
use
;
a
golden
liquid
,
worth
more
than
*NL*
liquid
gold
;
so
rare
and
admirable
,
that
veteran
wine-bibbers
count
it
*NL*
among
their
epochs
to
have
tasted
it
!
It
drives
away
the
heart-ache
,
*NL*
and
substitutes
no
head-ache
!
Could
the
Judge
but
quaff
a
glass
,
it
*NL*
might
enable
him
to
shake
off
the
unaccountable
lethargy
which
-LRB-
for
the
*NL*
ten
intervening
minutes
,
and
five
to
boot
,
are
already
past
-RRB-
has
made
*NL*
him
such
a
laggard
at
this
momentous
dinner
.
It
would
all
but
revive
a
*NL*
dead
man
!
Would
you
like
to
sip
it
now
,
Judge
Pyncheon
?
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
,
this
dinner
.
Have
you
really
forgotten
its
true
object
?
Then
*NL*
let
us
whisper
it
,
that
you
may
start
at
once
out
of
the
oaken
chair
,
*NL*
which
really
seems
to
be
enchanted
,
like
the
one
in
Comus
,
or
that
in
*NL*
which
Moll
Pitcher
imprisoned
your
own
grandfather
.
But
ambition
is
a
*NL*
talisman
more
powerful
than
witchcraft
.
Start
up
,
then
,
and
,
hurrying
*NL*
through
the
streets
,
burst
in
upon
the
company
,
that
they
may
begin
*NL*
before
the
fish
is
spoiled
!
They
wait
for
you
;
and
it
is
little
for
*NL*
your
interest
that
they
should
wait
.
These
gentlemen
--
need
you
be
told
*NL*
it
?
--
have
assembled
,
not
without
purpose
,
from
every
quarter
of
the
*NL*
State
.
They
are
practised
politicians
,
every
man
of
them
,
and
skilled
*NL*
to
adjust
those
preliminary
measures
which
steal
from
the
people
,
*NL*
without
its
knowledge
,
the
power
of
choosing
its
own
rulers
.
The
*NL*
popular
voice
,
at
the
next
gubernatorial
election
,
though
loud
as
*NL*
thunder
,
will
be
really
but
an
echo
of
what
these
gentlemen
shall
*NL*
speak
,
under
their
breath
,
at
your
friend
's
festive
board
.
They
meet
*NL*
to
decide
upon
their
candidate
.
This
little
knot
of
subtle
schemers
*NL*
will
control
the
convention
,
and
,
through
it
,
dictate
to
the
party
.
*NL*
And
what
worthier
candidate
,
--
more
wise
and
learned
,
more
noted
for
*NL*
philanthropic
liberality
,
truer
to
safe
principles
,
tried
oftener
by
*NL*
public
trusts
,
more
spotless
in
private
character
,
with
a
larger
stake
*NL*
in
the
common
welfare
,
and
deeper
grounded
,
by
hereditary
descent
,
in
*NL*
the
faith
and
practice
of
the
Puritans
,
--
what
man
can
be
presented
for
*NL*
the
suffrage
of
the
people
,
so
eminently
combining
all
these
claims
to
*NL*
the
chief-rulership
as
Judge
Pyncheon
here
before
us
?
*NL*
*NL*
Make
haste
,
then
!
Do
your
part
!
The
meed
for
which
you
have
toiled
,
and
*NL*
fought
,
and
climbed
,
and
crept
,
is
ready
for
your
grasp
!
Be
present
at
*NL*
this
dinner
!
--
drink
a
glass
or
two
of
that
noble
wine
!
--
make
your
*NL*
pledges
in
as
low
a
whisper
as
you
will
!
--
and
you
rise
up
from
table
*NL*
virtually
governor
of
the
glorious
old
State
!
Governor
Pyncheon
of
*NL*
Massachusetts
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
is
there
no
potent
and
exhilarating
cordial
in
a
certainty
like
*NL*
this
?
It
has
been
the
grand
purpose
of
half
your
lifetime
to
obtain
it
.
*NL*
Now
,
when
there
needs
little
more
than
to
signify
your
acceptance
,
why
*NL*
do
you
sit
so
lumpishly
in
your
great-great-grandfather
's
oaken
chair
,
*NL*
as
if
preferring
it
to
the
gubernatorial
one
?
We
have
all
heard
of
King
*NL*
Log
;
but
,
in
these
jostling
times
,
one
of
that
royal
kindred
will
*NL*
hardly
win
the
race
for
an
elective
chief-magistracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
;
it
is
absolutely
too
late
for
dinner
!
Turtle
,
salmon
,
tautog
,
*NL*
woodcock
,
boiled
turkey
,
South-Down
mutton
,
pig
,
roast-beef
,
have
*NL*
vanished
,
or
exist
only
in
fragments
,
with
lukewarm
potatoes
,
and
*NL*
gravies
crusted
over
with
cold
fat
.
The
Judge
,
had
he
done
nothing
*NL*
else
,
would
have
achieved
wonders
with
his
knife
and
fork
.
It
was
he
,
*NL*
you
know
,
of
whom
it
used
to
be
said
,
in
reference
to
his
ogre-like
*NL*
appetite
,
that
his
Creator
made
him
a
great
animal
,
but
that
the
*NL*
dinner-hour
made
him
a
great
beast
.
Persons
of
his
large
sensual
*NL*
endowments
must
claim
indulgence
,
at
their
feeding-time
.
But
,
for
*NL*
once
,
the
Judge
is
entirely
too
late
for
dinner
!
Too
late
,
we
fear
,
*NL*
even
to
join
the
party
at
their
wine
!
The
guests
are
warm
and
merry
;
*NL*
they
have
given
up
the
Judge
;
and
,
concluding
that
the
Free-Soilers
*NL*
have
him
,
they
will
fix
upon
another
candidate
.
Were
our
friend
now
to
*NL*
stalk
in
among
them
,
with
that
wide-open
stare
,
at
once
wild
and
*NL*
stolid
,
his
ungenial
presence
would
be
apt
to
change
their
cheer
.
*NL*
Neither
would
it
be
seemly
in
Judge
Pyncheon
,
generally
so
scrupulous
*NL*
in
his
attire
,
to
show
himself
at
a
dinner-table
with
that
crimson
*NL*
stain
upon
his
shirt-bosom
.
By
the
bye
,
how
came
it
there
?
It
is
an
*NL*
ugly
sight
,
at
any
rate
;
and
the
wisest
way
for
the
Judge
is
to
button
*NL*
his
coat
closely
over
his
breast
,
and
,
taking
his
horse
and
chaise
from
*NL*
the
livery
stable
,
to
make
all
speed
to
his
own
house
.
There
,
after
a
*NL*
glass
of
brandy
and
water
,
and
a
mutton-chop
,
a
beefsteak
,
a
broiled
*NL*
fowl
,
or
some
such
hasty
little
dinner
and
supper
all
in
one
,
he
had
*NL*
better
spend
the
evening
by
the
fireside
.
He
must
toast
his
slippers
a
*NL*
long
while
,
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
chilliness
which
the
air
of
this
*NL*
vile
old
house
has
sent
curdling
through
his
veins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
,
therefore
,
Judge
Pyncheon
,
up
!
You
have
lost
a
day
.
But
to-morrow
*NL*
will
be
here
anon
.
Will
you
rise
,
betimes
,
and
make
the
most
of
it
?
*NL*
To-morrow
.
To-morrow
!
To-morrow
.
We
,
that
are
alive
,
may
rise
betimes
*NL*
to-morrow
.
As
for
him
that
has
died
to-day
,
his
morrow
will
be
the
*NL*
resurrection
morn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
twilight
is
glooming
upward
out
of
the
corners
of
the
*NL*
room
.
The
shadows
of
the
tall
furniture
grow
deeper
,
and
at
first
*NL*
become
more
definite
;
then
,
spreading
wider
,
they
lose
their
*NL*
distinctness
of
outline
in
the
dark
gray
tide
of
oblivion
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
that
creeps
slowly
over
the
various
objects
,
and
the
one
human
figure
*NL*
sitting
in
the
midst
of
them
.
The
gloom
has
not
entered
from
without
;
*NL*
it
has
brooded
here
all
day
,
and
now
,
taking
its
own
inevitable
time
,
*NL*
will
possess
itself
of
everything
.
The
Judge
's
face
,
indeed
,
rigid
and
*NL*
singularly
white
,
refuses
to
melt
into
this
universal
solvent
.
Fainter
*NL*
and
fainter
grows
the
light
.
It
is
as
if
another
double-handful
of
*NL*
darkness
had
been
scattered
through
the
air
.
Now
it
is
no
longer
gray
,
*NL*
but
sable
.
There
is
still
a
faint
appearance
at
the
window
;
neither
a
*NL*
glow
,
nor
a
gleam
,
nor
a
glimmer
,
--
any
phrase
of
light
would
express
*NL*
something
far
brighter
than
this
doubtful
perception
,
or
sense
,
rather
,
*NL*
that
there
is
a
window
there
.
Has
it
yet
vanished
?
No
!
--
yes
!
--
not
*NL*
quite
!
And
there
is
still
the
swarthy
whiteness
,
--
we
shall
venture
to
*NL*
marry
these
ill-agreeing
words
,
--
the
swarthy
whiteness
of
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
face
.
The
features
are
all
gone
:
there
is
only
the
paleness
*NL*
of
them
left
.
And
how
looks
it
now
?
There
is
no
window
!
There
is
no
*NL*
face
!
An
infinite
,
inscrutable
blackness
has
annihilated
sight
!
Where
*NL*
is
our
universe
?
All
crumbled
away
from
us
;
and
we
,
adrift
in
chaos
,
*NL*
may
hearken
to
the
gusts
of
homeless
wind
,
that
go
sighing
and
*NL*
murmuring
about
in
quest
of
what
was
once
a
world
!
*NL*
*NL*
Is
there
no
other
sound
?
One
other
,
and
a
fearful
one
.
It
is
the
*NL*
ticking
of
the
Judge
's
watch
,
which
,
ever
since
Hepzibah
left
the
room
*NL*
in
search
of
Clifford
,
he
has
been
holding
in
his
hand
.
Be
the
cause
*NL*
what
it
may
,
this
little
,
quiet
,
never-ceasing
throb
of
Time
's
pulse
,
*NL*
repeating
its
small
strokes
with
such
busy
regularity
,
in
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
motionless
hand
,
has
an
effect
of
terror
,
which
we
do
not
*NL*
find
in
any
other
accompaniment
of
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
listen
!
That
puff
of
the
breeze
was
louder
.
It
had
a
tone
unlike
*NL*
the
dreary
and
sullen
one
which
has
bemoaned
itself
,
and
afflicted
all
*NL*
mankind
with
miserable
sympathy
,
for
five
days
past
.
The
wind
has
*NL*
veered
about
!
It
now
comes
boisterously
from
the
northwest
,
and
,
taking
*NL*
hold
of
the
aged
framework
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
gives
it
a
shake
,
like
*NL*
a
wrestler
that
would
try
strength
with
his
antagonist
.
Another
and
*NL*
another
sturdy
tussle
with
the
blast
!
The
old
house
creaks
again
,
and
*NL*
makes
a
vociferous
but
somewhat
unintelligible
bellowing
in
its
sooty
*NL*
throat
-LRB-
the
big
flue
,
we
mean
,
of
its
wide
chimney
-RRB-
,
partly
in
*NL*
complaint
at
the
rude
wind
,
but
rather
,
as
befits
their
century
and
a
*NL*
half
of
hostile
intimacy
,
in
tough
defiance
.
A
rumbling
kind
of
a
*NL*
bluster
roars
behind
the
fire-board
.
A
door
has
slammed
above
stairs
.
*NL*
A
window
,
perhaps
,
has
been
left
open
,
or
else
is
driven
in
by
an
*NL*
unruly
gust
.
It
is
not
to
be
conceived
,
before-hand
,
what
wonderful
*NL*
wind-instruments
are
these
old
timber
mansions
,
and
how
haunted
with
*NL*
the
strangest
noises
,
which
immediately
begin
to
sing
,
and
sigh
,
and
*NL*
sob
,
and
shriek
,
--
and
to
smite
with
sledge-hammers
,
airy
but
ponderous
,
*NL*
in
some
distant
chamber
,
--
and
to
tread
along
the
entries
as
with
*NL*
stately
footsteps
,
and
rustle
up
and
down
the
staircase
,
as
with
silks
*NL*
miraculously
stiff
,
--
whenever
the
gale
catches
the
house
with
a
window
*NL*
open
,
and
gets
fairly
into
it
.
Would
that
we
were
not
an
attendant
*NL*
spirit
here
!
It
is
too
awful
!
This
clamor
of
the
wind
through
the
*NL*
lonely
house
;
the
Judge
's
quietude
,
as
he
sits
invisible
;
and
that
*NL*
pertinacious
ticking
of
his
watch
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
regards
Judge
Pyncheon
's
invisibility
,
however
,
that
matter
will
*NL*
soon
be
remedied
.
The
northwest
wind
has
swept
the
sky
clear
.
The
*NL*
window
is
distinctly
seen
.
Through
its
panes
,
moreover
,
we
dimly
catch
*NL*
the
sweep
of
the
dark
,
clustering
foliage
outside
,
fluttering
with
a
*NL*
constant
irregularity
of
movement
,
and
letting
in
a
peep
of
starlight
,
*NL*
now
here
,
now
there
.
Oftener
than
any
other
object
,
these
glimpses
*NL*
illuminate
the
Judge
's
face
.
But
here
comes
more
effectual
light
.
*NL*
Observe
that
silvery
dance
upon
the
upper
branches
of
the
pear-tree
,
*NL*
and
now
a
little
lower
,
and
now
on
the
whole
mass
of
boughs
,
while
,
*NL*
through
their
shifting
intricacies
,
the
moonbeams
fall
aslant
into
the
*NL*
room
.
They
play
over
the
Judge
's
figure
and
show
that
he
has
not
*NL*
stirred
throughout
the
hours
of
darkness
.
They
follow
the
shadows
,
in
*NL*
changeful
sport
,
across
his
unchanging
features
.
They
gleam
upon
his
*NL*
watch
.
His
grasp
conceals
the
dial-plate
,
--
but
we
know
that
the
*NL*
faithful
hands
have
met
;
for
one
of
the
city
clocks
tells
midnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
of
sturdy
understanding
,
like
Judge
Pyncheon
,
cares
no
more
for
*NL*
twelve
o'clock
at
night
than
for
the
corresponding
hour
of
noon
.
*NL*
However
just
the
parallel
drawn
,
in
some
of
the
preceding
pages
,
*NL*
between
his
Puritan
ancestor
and
himself
,
it
fails
in
this
point
.
The
*NL*
Pyncheon
of
two
centuries
ago
,
in
common
with
most
of
his
*NL*
contemporaries
,
professed
his
full
belief
in
spiritual
ministrations
,
*NL*
although
reckoning
them
chiefly
of
a
malignant
character
.
The
Pyncheon
*NL*
of
to-night
,
who
sits
in
yonder
arm-chair
,
believes
in
no
such
*NL*
nonsense
.
Such
,
at
least
,
was
his
creed
,
some
few
hours
since
.
His
*NL*
hair
will
not
bristle
,
therefore
,
at
the
stories
which
--
in
times
when
*NL*
chimney-corners
had
benches
in
them
,
where
old
people
sat
poking
into
*NL*
the
ashes
of
the
past
,
and
raking
out
traditions
like
live
coals
--
used
*NL*
to
be
told
about
this
very
room
of
his
ancestral
house
.
In
fact
,
these
*NL*
tales
are
too
absurd
to
bristle
even
childhood
's
hair
.
What
sense
,
*NL*
meaning
,
or
moral
,
for
example
,
such
as
even
ghost-stories
should
be
*NL*
susceptible
of
,
can
be
traced
in
the
ridiculous
legend
,
that
,
at
*NL*
midnight
,
all
the
dead
Pyncheons
are
bound
to
assemble
in
this
parlor
?
*NL*
And
,
pray
,
for
what
?
Why
,
to
see
whether
the
portrait
of
their
ancestor
*NL*
still
keeps
its
place
upon
the
wall
,
in
compliance
with
his
*NL*
testamentary
directions
!
Is
it
worth
while
to
come
out
of
their
graves
*NL*
for
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
tempted
to
make
a
little
sport
with
the
idea
.
Ghost-stories
are
*NL*
hardly
to
be
treated
seriously
any
longer
.
The
family-party
of
the
*NL*
defunct
Pyncheons
,
we
presume
,
goes
off
in
this
wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
comes
the
ancestor
himself
,
in
his
black
cloak
,
steeple-hat
,
and
*NL*
trunk-breeches
,
girt
about
the
waist
with
a
leathern
belt
,
in
which
*NL*
hangs
his
steel-hilted
sword
;
he
has
a
long
staff
in
his
hand
,
such
as
*NL*
gentlemen
in
advanced
life
used
to
carry
,
as
much
for
the
dignity
of
*NL*
the
thing
as
for
the
support
to
be
derived
from
it
.
He
looks
up
at
the
*NL*
portrait
;
a
thing
of
no
substance
,
gazing
at
its
own
painted
image
!
All
*NL*
is
safe
.
The
picture
is
still
there
.
The
purpose
of
his
brain
has
*NL*
been
kept
sacred
thus
long
after
the
man
himself
has
sprouted
up
in
*NL*
graveyard
grass
.
See
!
he
lifts
his
ineffectual
hand
,
and
tries
the
*NL*
frame
.
All
safe
!
But
is
that
a
smile
?
--
is
it
not
,
rather
a
frown
of
*NL*
deadly
import
,
that
darkens
over
the
shadow
of
his
features
?
The
stout
*NL*
Colonel
is
dissatisfied
!
So
decided
is
his
look
of
discontent
as
to
*NL*
impart
additional
distinctness
to
his
features
;
through
which
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
the
moonlight
passes
,
and
flickers
on
the
wall
beyond
.
*NL*
Something
has
strangely
vexed
the
ancestor
!
With
a
grim
shake
of
the
*NL*
head
,
he
turns
away
.
Here
come
other
Pyncheons
,
the
whole
tribe
,
in
*NL*
their
half
a
dozen
generations
,
jostling
and
elbowing
one
another
,
to
*NL*
reach
the
picture
.
We
behold
aged
men
and
grandames
,
a
clergyman
with
*NL*
the
Puritanic
stiffness
still
in
his
garb
and
mien
,
and
a
red-coated
*NL*
officer
of
the
old
French
war
;
and
there
comes
the
shop-keeping
*NL*
Pyncheon
of
a
century
ago
,
with
the
ruffles
turned
back
from
his
*NL*
wrists
;
and
there
the
periwigged
and
brocaded
gentleman
of
the
artist
's
*NL*
legend
,
with
the
beautiful
and
pensive
Alice
,
who
brings
no
pride
out
*NL*
of
her
virgin
grave
.
All
try
the
picture-frame
.
What
do
these
ghostly
*NL*
people
seek
?
A
mother
lifts
her
child
,
that
his
little
hands
may
touch
*NL*
it
!
There
is
evidently
a
mystery
about
the
picture
,
that
perplexes
*NL*
these
poor
Pyncheons
when
they
ought
to
be
at
rest
.
In
a
corner
,
*NL*
meanwhile
,
stands
the
figure
of
an
elderly
man
,
in
a
leathern
jerkin
*NL*
and
breeches
,
with
a
carpenter
's
rule
sticking
out
of
his
side
pocket
;
*NL*
he
points
his
finger
at
the
bearded
Colonel
and
his
descendants
,
*NL*
nodding
,
jeering
,
mocking
,
and
finally
bursting
into
obstreperous
,
*NL*
though
inaudible
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indulging
our
fancy
in
this
freak
,
we
have
partly
lost
the
power
of
*NL*
restraint
and
guidance
.
We
distinguish
an
unlooked-for
figure
in
our
*NL*
visionary
scene
.
Among
those
ancestral
people
there
is
a
young
man
,
*NL*
dressed
in
the
very
fashion
of
to-day
:
he
wears
a
dark
frock-coat
,
*NL*
almost
destitute
of
skirts
,
gray
pantaloons
,
gaiter
boots
of
patent
*NL*
leather
,
and
has
a
finely
wrought
gold
chain
across
his
breast
,
and
a
*NL*
little
silver-headed
whalebone
stick
in
his
hand
.
Were
we
to
meet
this
*NL*
figure
at
noonday
,
we
should
greet
him
as
young
Jaffrey
Pyncheon
,
the
*NL*
Judge
's
only
surviving
child
,
who
has
been
spending
the
last
two
years
*NL*
in
foreign
travel
.
If
still
in
life
,
how
comes
his
shadow
hither
?
If
*NL*
dead
,
what
a
misfortune
!
The
old
Pyncheon
property
,
together
with
the
*NL*
great
estate
acquired
by
the
young
man
's
father
,
would
devolve
on
whom
?
*NL*
On
poor
,
foolish
Clifford
,
gaunt
Hepzibah
,
and
rustic
little
Phoebe
!
*NL*
But
another
and
a
greater
marvel
greets
us
!
Can
we
believe
our
eyes
?
A
*NL*
stout
,
elderly
gentleman
has
made
his
appearance
;
he
has
an
aspect
of
*NL*
eminent
respectability
,
wears
a
black
coat
and
pantaloons
,
of
roomy
*NL*
width
,
and
might
be
pronounced
scrupulously
neat
in
his
attire
,
but
for
*NL*
a
broad
crimson
stain
across
his
snowy
neckcloth
and
down
his
*NL*
shirt-bosom
.
Is
it
the
Judge
,
or
no
?
How
can
it
be
Judge
Pyncheon
?
We
*NL*
discern
his
figure
,
as
plainly
as
the
flickering
moonbeams
can
show
us
*NL*
anything
,
still
seated
in
the
oaken
chair
!
Be
the
apparition
whose
it
*NL*
may
,
it
advances
to
the
picture
,
seems
to
seize
the
frame
,
tries
to
*NL*
peep
behind
it
,
and
turns
away
,
with
a
frown
as
black
as
the
ancestral
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fantastic
scene
just
hinted
at
must
by
no
means
be
considered
as
*NL*
forming
an
actual
portion
of
our
story
.
We
were
betrayed
into
this
*NL*
brief
extravagance
by
the
quiver
of
the
moonbeams
;
they
dance
*NL*
hand-in-hand
with
shadows
,
and
are
reflected
in
the
looking-glass
,
*NL*
which
,
you
are
aware
,
is
always
a
kind
of
window
or
doorway
into
the
*NL*
spiritual
world
.
We
needed
relief
,
moreover
,
from
our
too
long
and
*NL*
exclusive
contemplation
of
that
figure
in
the
chair
.
This
wild
wind
,
*NL*
too
,
has
tossed
our
thoughts
into
strange
confusion
,
but
without
*NL*
tearing
them
away
from
their
one
determined
centre
.
Yonder
leaden
*NL*
Judge
sits
immovably
upon
our
soul
.
Will
he
never
stir
again
?
We
shall
*NL*
go
mad
unless
he
stirs
!
You
may
the
better
estimate
his
quietude
by
the
*NL*
fearlessness
of
a
little
mouse
,
which
sits
on
its
hind
legs
,
in
a
*NL*
streak
of
moonlight
,
close
by
Judge
Pyncheon
's
foot
,
and
seems
to
*NL*
meditate
a
journey
of
exploration
over
this
great
black
bulk
.
Ha
!
what
*NL*
has
startled
the
nimble
little
mouse
?
It
is
the
visage
of
grimalkin
,
*NL*
outside
of
the
window
,
where
he
appears
to
have
posted
himself
for
a
*NL*
deliberate
watch
.
This
grimalkin
has
a
very
ugly
look
.
Is
it
a
cat
*NL*
watching
for
a
mouse
,
or
the
devil
for
a
human
soul
?
Would
we
could
*NL*
scare
him
from
the
window
!
*NL*
*NL*
Thank
Heaven
,
the
night
is
well-nigh
past
!
The
moonbeams
have
no
longer
*NL*
so
silvery
a
gleam
,
nor
contrast
so
strongly
with
the
blackness
of
the
*NL*
shadows
among
which
they
fall
.
They
are
paler
now
;
the
shadows
look
*NL*
gray
,
not
black
.
The
boisterous
wind
is
hushed
.
What
is
the
hour
?
Ah
!
*NL*
the
watch
has
at
last
ceased
to
tick
;
for
the
Judge
's
forgetful
fingers
*NL*
neglected
to
wind
it
up
,
as
usual
,
at
ten
o'clock
,
being
half
an
hour
*NL*
or
so
before
his
ordinary
bedtime
,
--
and
it
has
run
down
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
five
years
.
But
the
great
world-clock
of
Time
still
keeps
its
*NL*
beat
.
The
dreary
night
--
for
,
oh
,
how
dreary
seems
its
haunted
waste
,
*NL*
behind
us
!
--
gives
place
to
a
fresh
,
transparent
,
cloudless
morn
.
*NL*
Blessed
,
blessed
radiance
!
The
daybeam
--
even
what
little
of
it
finds
*NL*
its
way
into
this
always
dusky
parlor
--
seems
part
of
the
universal
*NL*
benediction
,
annulling
evil
,
and
rendering
all
goodness
possible
,
and
*NL*
happiness
attainable
.
Will
Judge
Pyncheon
now
rise
up
from
his
chair
?
*NL*
Will
he
go
forth
,
and
receive
the
early
sunbeams
on
his
brow
?
Will
he
*NL*
begin
this
new
day
,
--
which
God
has
smiled
upon
,
and
blessed
,
and
given
*NL*
to
mankind
,
--
will
he
begin
it
with
better
purposes
than
the
many
that
*NL*
have
been
spent
amiss
?
Or
are
all
the
deep-laid
schemes
of
yesterday
as
*NL*
stubborn
in
his
heart
,
and
as
busy
in
his
brain
,
as
ever
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
latter
case
,
there
is
much
to
do
.
Will
the
Judge
still
insist
*NL*
with
Hepzibah
on
the
interview
with
Clifford
?
Will
he
buy
a
safe
,
*NL*
elderly
gentleman
's
horse
?
Will
he
persuade
the
purchaser
of
the
old
*NL*
Pyncheon
property
to
relinquish
the
bargain
in
his
favor
?
Will
he
see
*NL*
his
family
physician
,
and
obtain
a
medicine
that
shall
preserve
him
,
to
*NL*
be
an
honor
and
blessing
to
his
race
,
until
the
utmost
term
of
*NL*
patriarchal
longevity
?
Will
Judge
Pyncheon
,
above
all
,
make
due
*NL*
apologies
to
that
company
of
honorable
friends
,
and
satisfy
them
that
*NL*
his
absence
from
the
festive
board
was
unavoidable
,
and
so
fully
*NL*
retrieve
himself
in
their
good
opinion
that
he
shall
yet
be
Governor
of
*NL*
Massachusetts
?
And
all
these
great
purposes
accomplished
,
will
he
walk
*NL*
the
streets
again
,
with
that
dog-day
smile
of
elaborate
benevolence
,
*NL*
sultry
enough
to
tempt
flies
to
come
and
buzz
in
it
?
Or
will
he
,
after
*NL*
the
tomb-like
seclusion
of
the
past
day
and
night
,
go
forth
a
humbled
*NL*
and
repentant
man
,
sorrowful
,
gentle
,
seeking
no
profit
,
shrinking
from
*NL*
worldly
honor
,
hardly
daring
to
love
God
,
but
bold
to
love
his
fellow
*NL*
man
,
and
to
do
him
what
good
he
may
?
Will
he
bear
about
with
him
,
--
no
*NL*
odious
grin
of
feigned
benignity
,
insolent
in
its
pretence
,
and
*NL*
loathsome
in
its
falsehood
,
--
but
the
tender
sadness
of
a
contrite
*NL*
heart
,
broken
,
at
last
,
beneath
its
own
weight
of
sin
?
For
it
is
our
*NL*
belief
,
whatever
show
of
honor
he
may
have
piled
upon
it
,
that
there
*NL*
was
heavy
sin
at
the
base
of
this
man
's
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rise
up
,
Judge
Pyncheon
!
The
morning
sunshine
glimmers
through
the
*NL*
foliage
,
and
,
beautiful
and
holy
as
it
is
,
shuns
not
to
kindle
up
your
*NL*
face
.
Rise
up
,
thou
subtle
,
worldly
,
selfish
,
iron-hearted
hypocrite
,
*NL*
and
make
thy
choice
whether
still
to
be
subtle
,
worldly
,
selfish
,
*NL*
iron-hearted
,
and
hypocritical
,
or
to
tear
these
sins
out
of
thy
*NL*
nature
,
though
they
bring
the
lifeblood
with
them
!
The
Avenger
is
upon
*NL*
thee
!
Rise
up
,
before
it
be
too
late
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
!
Thou
art
not
stirred
by
this
last
appeal
?
No
,
not
a
jot
!
And
*NL*
there
we
see
a
fly
,
--
one
of
your
common
house-flies
,
such
as
are
always
*NL*
buzzing
on
the
window-pane
,
--
which
has
smelt
out
Governor
Pyncheon
,
and
*NL*
alights
,
now
on
his
forehead
,
now
on
his
chin
,
and
now
,
Heaven
help
us
!
*NL*
is
creeping
over
the
bridge
of
his
nose
,
towards
the
would-be
*NL*
chief-magistrate
's
wide-open
eyes
!
Canst
thou
not
brush
the
fly
away
?
*NL*
Art
thou
too
sluggish
?
Thou
man
,
that
hadst
so
many
busy
projects
*NL*
yesterday
!
Art
thou
too
weak
,
that
wast
so
powerful
?
Not
brush
away
a
*NL*
fly
?
Nay
,
then
,
we
give
thee
up
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
hark
!
the
shop-bell
rings
.
After
hours
like
these
latter
ones
,
*NL*
through
which
we
have
borne
our
heavy
tale
,
it
is
good
to
be
made
*NL*
sensible
that
there
is
a
living
world
,
and
that
even
this
old
,
lonely
*NL*
mansion
retains
some
manner
of
connection
with
it
.
We
breathe
more
*NL*
freely
,
emerging
from
Judge
Pyncheon
's
presence
into
the
street
before
*NL*
the
Seven
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
XIX
Alice
's
Posies
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
UNCLE
VENNER
,
trundling
a
wheelbarrow
,
was
the
earliest
person
stirring
*NL*
in
the
neighborhood
the
day
after
the
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pyncheon
Street
,
in
front
of
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
was
a
far
*NL*
pleasanter
scene
than
a
by-lane
,
confined
by
shabby
fences
,
and
*NL*
bordered
with
wooden
dwellings
of
the
meaner
class
,
could
reasonably
be
*NL*
expected
to
present
.
Nature
made
sweet
amends
,
that
morning
,
for
the
*NL*
five
unkindly
days
which
had
preceded
it
.
It
would
have
been
enough
to
*NL*
live
for
,
merely
to
look
up
at
the
wide
benediction
of
the
sky
,
or
as
*NL*
much
of
it
as
was
visible
between
the
houses
,
genial
once
more
with
*NL*
sunshine
.
Every
object
was
agreeable
,
whether
to
be
gazed
at
in
the
*NL*
breadth
,
or
examined
more
minutely
.
Such
,
for
example
,
were
the
*NL*
well-washed
pebbles
and
gravel
of
the
sidewalk
;
even
the
sky-reflecting
*NL*
pools
in
the
centre
of
the
street
;
and
the
grass
,
now
freshly
verdant
,
*NL*
that
crept
along
the
base
of
the
fences
,
on
the
other
side
of
which
,
if
*NL*
one
peeped
over
,
was
seen
the
multifarious
growth
of
gardens
.
*NL*
Vegetable
productions
,
of
whatever
kind
,
seemed
more
than
negatively
*NL*
happy
,
in
the
juicy
warmth
and
abundance
of
their
life
.
The
Pyncheon
*NL*
Elm
,
throughout
its
great
circumference
,
was
all
alive
,
and
full
of
the
*NL*
morning
sun
and
a
sweet-tempered
little
breeze
,
which
lingered
within
*NL*
this
verdant
sphere
,
and
set
a
thousand
leafy
tongues
a-whispering
all
*NL*
at
once
.
This
aged
tree
appeared
to
have
suffered
nothing
from
the
*NL*
gale
.
It
had
kept
its
boughs
unshattered
,
and
its
full
complement
of
*NL*
leaves
;
and
the
whole
in
perfect
verdure
,
except
a
single
branch
,
that
,
*NL*
by
the
earlier
change
with
which
the
elm-tree
sometimes
prophesies
the
*NL*
autumn
,
had
been
transmuted
to
bright
gold
.
It
was
like
the
golden
*NL*
branch
that
gained
Aeneas
and
the
Sibyl
admittance
into
Hades
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
one
mystic
branch
hung
down
before
the
main
entrance
of
the
Seven
*NL*
Gables
,
so
nigh
the
ground
that
any
passer-by
might
have
stood
on
*NL*
tiptoe
and
plucked
it
off
.
Presented
at
the
door
,
it
would
have
been
a
*NL*
symbol
of
his
right
to
enter
,
and
be
made
acquainted
with
all
the
*NL*
secrets
of
the
house
.
So
little
faith
is
due
to
external
appearance
,
*NL*
that
there
was
really
an
inviting
aspect
over
the
venerable
edifice
,
*NL*
conveying
an
idea
that
its
history
must
be
a
decorous
and
happy
one
,
*NL*
and
such
as
would
be
delightful
for
a
fireside
tale
.
Its
windows
*NL*
gleamed
cheerfully
in
the
slanting
sunlight
.
The
lines
and
tufts
of
*NL*
green
moss
,
here
and
there
,
seemed
pledges
of
familiarity
and
*NL*
sisterhood
with
Nature
;
as
if
this
human
dwelling-place
,
being
of
such
*NL*
old
date
,
had
established
its
prescriptive
title
among
primeval
oaks
*NL*
and
whatever
other
objects
,
by
virtue
of
their
long
continuance
,
have
*NL*
acquired
a
gracious
right
to
be
.
A
person
of
imaginative
temperament
,
*NL*
while
passing
by
the
house
,
would
turn
,
once
and
again
,
and
peruse
it
*NL*
well
:
its
many
peaks
,
consenting
together
in
the
clustered
chimney
;
*NL*
the
deep
projection
over
its
basement-story
;
the
arched
window
,
*NL*
imparting
a
look
,
if
not
of
grandeur
,
yet
of
antique
gentility
,
to
the
*NL*
broken
portal
over
which
it
opened
;
the
luxuriance
of
gigantic
*NL*
burdocks
,
near
the
threshold
;
he
would
note
all
these
characteristics
,
*NL*
and
be
conscious
of
something
deeper
than
he
saw
.
He
would
conceive
*NL*
the
mansion
to
have
been
the
residence
of
the
stubborn
old
Puritan
,
*NL*
Integrity
,
who
,
dying
in
some
forgotten
generation
,
had
left
a
blessing
*NL*
in
all
its
rooms
and
chambers
,
the
efficacy
of
which
was
to
be
seen
in
*NL*
the
religion
,
honesty
,
moderate
competence
,
or
upright
poverty
and
*NL*
solid
happiness
,
of
his
descendants
,
to
this
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
object
,
above
all
others
,
would
take
root
in
the
imaginative
*NL*
observer
's
memory
.
It
was
the
great
tuft
of
flowers
,
--
weeds
,
you
would
*NL*
have
called
them
,
only
a
week
ago
,
--
the
tuft
of
crimson-spotted
*NL*
flowers
,
in
the
angle
between
the
two
front
gables
.
The
old
people
used
*NL*
to
give
them
the
name
of
Alice
's
Posies
,
in
remembrance
of
fair
Alice
*NL*
Pyncheon
,
who
was
believed
to
have
brought
their
seeds
from
Italy
.
*NL*
They
were
flaunting
in
rich
beauty
and
full
bloom
to-day
,
and
seemed
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
a
mystic
expression
that
something
within
the
house
was
*NL*
consummated
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
but
little
after
sunrise
,
when
Uncle
Venner
made
his
appearance
,
*NL*
as
aforesaid
,
impelling
a
wheelbarrow
along
the
street
.
He
was
going
*NL*
his
matutinal
rounds
to
collect
cabbage-leaves
,
turnip-tops
,
*NL*
potato-skins
,
and
the
miscellaneous
refuse
of
the
dinner-pot
,
which
the
*NL*
thrifty
housewives
of
the
neighborhood
were
accustomed
to
put
aside
,
as
*NL*
fit
only
to
feed
a
pig
.
Uncle
Venner
's
pig
was
fed
entirely
,
and
kept
*NL*
in
prime
order
,
on
these
eleemosynary
contributions
;
insomuch
that
the
*NL*
patched
philosopher
used
to
promise
that
,
before
retiring
to
his
farm
,
*NL*
he
would
make
a
feast
of
the
portly
grunter
,
and
invite
all
his
*NL*
neighbors
to
partake
of
the
joints
and
spare-ribs
which
they
had
helped
*NL*
to
fatten
.
Miss
Hepzibah
Pyncheon
's
housekeeping
had
so
greatly
*NL*
improved
,
since
Clifford
became
a
member
of
the
family
,
that
her
share
*NL*
of
the
banquet
would
have
been
no
lean
one
;
and
Uncle
Venner
,
*NL*
accordingly
,
was
a
good
deal
disappointed
not
to
find
the
large
earthen
*NL*
pan
,
full
of
fragmentary
eatables
,
that
ordinarily
awaited
his
coming
*NL*
at
the
back
doorstep
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
knew
Miss
Hepzibah
so
forgetful
before
,
''
said
the
patriarch
to
*NL*
himself
.
``
She
must
have
had
a
dinner
yesterday
,
--
no
question
of
that
!
*NL*
She
always
has
one
,
nowadays
.
So
where
's
the
pot-liquor
and
*NL*
potato-skins
,
I
ask
?
Shall
I
knock
,
and
see
if
she
's
stirring
yet
?
No
,
*NL*
no
,
--
'
t
wo
n't
do
!
If
little
Phoebe
was
about
the
house
,
I
should
not
*NL*
mind
knocking
;
but
Miss
Hepzibah
,
likely
as
not
,
would
scowl
down
at
me
*NL*
out
of
the
window
,
and
look
cross
,
even
if
she
felt
pleasantly
.
So
,
*NL*
I
'll
come
back
at
noon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
reflections
,
the
old
man
was
shutting
the
gate
of
the
little
*NL*
back-yard
.
Creaking
on
its
hinges
,
however
,
like
every
other
gate
and
*NL*
door
about
the
premises
,
the
sound
reached
the
ears
of
the
occupant
of
*NL*
the
northern
gable
,
one
of
the
windows
of
which
had
a
side-view
towards
*NL*
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-morning
,
Uncle
Venner
!
''
said
the
daguerreotypist
,
leaning
out
of
*NL*
the
window
.
``
Do
you
hear
nobody
stirring
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
soul
,
''
said
the
man
of
patches
.
``
But
that
's
no
wonder
.
'T
is
*NL*
barely
half
an
hour
past
sunrise
,
yet
.
But
I
'm
really
glad
to
see
you
,
*NL*
Mr.
Holgrave
!
There
's
a
strange
,
lonesome
look
about
this
side
of
the
*NL*
house
;
so
that
my
heart
misgave
me
,
somehow
or
other
,
and
I
felt
as
if
*NL*
there
was
nobody
alive
in
it
.
The
front
of
the
house
looks
a
good
deal
*NL*
cheerier
;
and
Alice
's
Posies
are
blooming
there
beautifully
;
and
if
I
*NL*
were
a
young
man
,
Mr.
Holgrave
,
my
sweetheart
should
have
one
of
those
*NL*
flowers
in
her
bosom
,
though
I
risked
my
neck
climbing
for
it
!
Well
,
*NL*
and
did
the
wind
keep
you
awake
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
did
,
indeed
!
''
answered
the
artist
,
smiling
.
``
If
I
were
a
believer
*NL*
in
ghosts
,
--
and
I
do
n't
quite
know
whether
I
am
or
not
,
--
I
should
have
*NL*
concluded
that
all
the
old
Pyncheons
were
running
riot
in
the
lower
*NL*
rooms
,
especially
in
Miss
Hepzibah
's
part
of
the
house
.
But
it
is
very
*NL*
quiet
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
Hepzibah
will
be
apt
to
over-sleep
herself
,
after
being
*NL*
disturbed
,
all
night
,
with
the
racket
,
''
said
Uncle
Venner
.
``
But
it
*NL*
would
be
odd
,
now
,
would
n't
it
,
if
the
Judge
had
taken
both
his
cousins
*NL*
into
the
country
along
with
him
?
I
saw
him
go
into
the
shop
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
hour
?
''
inquired
Holgrave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
along
in
the
forenoon
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
``
Well
,
well
!
I
must
go
*NL*
my
rounds
,
and
so
must
my
wheelbarrow
.
But
I
'll
be
back
here
at
*NL*
dinner-time
;
for
my
pig
likes
a
dinner
as
well
as
a
breakfast
.
No
*NL*
meal-time
,
and
no
sort
of
victuals
,
ever
seems
to
come
amiss
to
my
pig
.
*NL*
Good
morning
to
you
!
And
,
Mr.
Holgrave
,
if
I
were
a
young
man
,
like
*NL*
you
,
I
'd
get
one
of
Alice
's
Posies
,
and
keep
it
in
water
till
Phoebe
*NL*
comes
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
,
''
said
the
daguerreotypist
,
as
he
drew
in
his
head
,
``
that
*NL*
the
water
of
Maule
's
well
suits
those
flowers
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
conversation
ceased
,
and
Uncle
Venner
went
on
his
way
.
For
*NL*
half
an
hour
longer
,
nothing
disturbed
the
repose
of
the
Seven
Gables
;
*NL*
nor
was
there
any
visitor
,
except
a
carrier-boy
,
who
,
as
he
passed
the
*NL*
front
doorstep
,
threw
down
one
of
his
newspapers
;
for
Hepzibah
,
of
*NL*
late
,
had
regularly
taken
it
in
.
After
a
while
,
there
came
a
fat
*NL*
woman
,
making
prodigious
speed
,
and
stumbling
as
she
ran
up
the
steps
*NL*
of
the
shop-door
.
Her
face
glowed
with
fire-heat
,
and
,
it
being
a
*NL*
pretty
warm
morning
,
she
bubbled
and
hissed
,
as
it
were
,
as
if
all
*NL*
a-fry
with
chimney-warmth
,
and
summer-warmth
,
and
the
warmth
of
her
own
*NL*
corpulent
velocity
.
She
tried
the
shop-door
;
it
was
fast
.
She
tried
*NL*
it
again
,
with
so
angry
a
jar
that
the
bell
tinkled
angrily
back
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce
take
Old
Maid
Pyncheon
!
''
muttered
the
irascible
housewife
.
*NL*
``
Think
of
her
pretending
to
set
up
a
cent-shop
,
and
then
lying
abed
*NL*
till
noon
!
These
are
what
she
calls
gentlefolk
's
airs
,
I
suppose
!
But
*NL*
I
'll
either
start
her
ladyship
,
or
break
the
door
down
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
it
accordingly
,
and
the
bell
,
having
a
spiteful
little
temper
*NL*
of
its
own
,
rang
obstreperously
,
making
its
remonstrances
heard
,
--
not
,
*NL*
indeed
,
by
the
ears
for
which
they
were
intended
,
--
but
by
a
good
lady
*NL*
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
She
opened
the
window
,
and
*NL*
addressed
the
impatient
applicant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
find
nobody
there
,
Mrs.
Gubbins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
and
will
find
somebody
here
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Gubbins
,
*NL*
inflicting
another
outrage
on
the
bell
.
``
I
want
a
half-pound
of
pork
,
*NL*
to
fry
some
first-rate
flounders
for
Mr.
Gubbins
's
breakfast
;
and
,
lady
*NL*
or
not
,
Old
Maid
Pyncheon
shall
get
up
and
serve
me
with
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
hear
reason
,
Mrs.
Gubbins
!
''
responded
the
lady
opposite
.
``
She
,
*NL*
and
her
brother
too
,
have
both
gone
to
their
cousin
's
,
Judge
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
at
his
country-seat
.
There
's
not
a
soul
in
the
house
,
but
that
young
*NL*
daguerreotype-man
that
sleeps
in
the
north
gable
.
I
saw
old
Hepzibah
*NL*
and
Clifford
go
away
yesterday
;
and
a
queer
couple
of
ducks
they
were
,
*NL*
paddling
through
the
mud-puddles
!
They
're
gone
,
I
'll
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
know
they
're
gone
to
the
Judge
's
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Gubbins
.
*NL*
``
He
's
a
rich
man
;
and
there
's
been
a
quarrel
between
him
and
Hepzibah
*NL*
this
many
a
day
,
because
he
wo
n't
give
her
a
living
.
That
's
the
main
*NL*
reason
of
her
setting
up
a
cent-shop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
well
enough
,
''
said
the
neighbor
.
``
But
they
're
*NL*
gone
,
--
that
's
one
thing
certain
.
And
who
but
a
blood
relation
,
that
*NL*
could
n't
help
himself
,
I
ask
you
,
would
take
in
that
awful-tempered
old
*NL*
maid
,
and
that
dreadful
Clifford
?
That
's
it
,
you
may
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gubbins
took
her
departure
,
still
brimming
over
with
hot
wrath
*NL*
against
the
absent
Hepzibah
.
For
another
half-hour
,
or
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
considerably
more
,
there
was
almost
as
much
quiet
on
the
outside
of
the
*NL*
house
as
within
.
The
elm
,
however
,
made
a
pleasant
,
cheerful
,
sunny
*NL*
sigh
,
responsive
to
the
breeze
that
was
elsewhere
imperceptible
;
a
*NL*
swarm
of
insects
buzzed
merrily
under
its
drooping
shadow
,
and
became
*NL*
specks
of
light
whenever
they
darted
into
the
sunshine
;
a
locust
sang
,
*NL*
once
or
twice
,
in
some
inscrutable
seclusion
of
the
tree
;
and
a
*NL*
solitary
little
bird
,
with
plumage
of
pale
gold
,
came
and
hovered
about
*NL*
Alice
's
Posies
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
our
small
acquaintance
,
Ned
Higgins
,
trudged
up
the
street
,
on
*NL*
his
way
to
school
;
and
happening
,
for
the
first
time
in
a
fortnight
,
to
*NL*
be
the
possessor
of
a
cent
,
he
could
by
no
means
get
past
the
shop-door
*NL*
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
But
it
would
not
open
.
Again
and
again
,
however
,
*NL*
and
half
a
dozen
other
agains
,
with
the
inexorable
pertinacity
of
a
*NL*
child
intent
upon
some
object
important
to
itself
,
did
he
renew
his
*NL*
efforts
for
admittance
.
He
had
,
doubtless
,
set
his
heart
upon
an
*NL*
elephant
;
or
,
possibly
,
with
Hamlet
,
he
meant
to
eat
a
crocodile
.
In
*NL*
response
to
his
more
violent
attacks
,
the
bell
gave
,
now
and
then
,
a
*NL*
moderate
tinkle
,
but
could
not
be
stirred
into
clamor
by
any
exertion
*NL*
of
the
little
fellow
's
childish
and
tiptoe
strength
.
Holding
by
the
*NL*
door-handle
,
he
peeped
through
a
crevice
of
the
curtain
,
and
saw
that
*NL*
the
inner
door
,
communicating
with
the
passage
towards
the
parlor
,
was
*NL*
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Pyncheon
!
''
screamed
the
child
,
rapping
on
the
window-pane
,
``
I
*NL*
want
an
elephant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
being
no
answer
to
several
repetitions
of
the
summons
,
Ned
began
*NL*
to
grow
impatient
;
and
his
little
pot
of
passion
quickly
boiling
over
,
*NL*
he
picked
up
a
stone
,
with
a
naughty
purpose
to
fling
it
through
the
*NL*
window
;
at
the
same
time
blubbering
and
sputtering
with
wrath
.
A
*NL*
man
--
one
of
two
who
happened
to
be
passing
by
--
caught
the
urchin
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
trouble
,
old
gentleman
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
old
Hepzibah
,
or
Phoebe
,
or
any
of
them
!
''
answered
Ned
,
*NL*
sobbing
.
``
They
wo
n't
open
the
door
;
and
I
ca
n't
get
my
elephant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
school
,
you
little
scamp
!
''
said
the
man
.
``
There
's
another
*NL*
cent-shop
round
the
corner
.
'
T
is
very
strange

Dixey
,
''
added
he
to
*NL*
his
companion
,
``
what
's
become
of
all
these
Pyncheon
's
!
Smith
,
the
*NL*
livery-stable
keeper
,
tells
me
Judge
Pyncheon
put
his
horse
up
*NL*
yesterday
,
to
stand
till
after
dinner
,
and
has
not
taken
him
away
yet
.
*NL*
And
one
of
the
Judge
's
hired
men
has
been
in
,
this
morning
,
to
make
*NL*
inquiry
about
him
.
He
's
a
kind
of
person
,
they
say
,
that
seldom
breaks
*NL*
his
habits
,
or
stays
out
o
'
nights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
'll
turn
up
safe
enough
!
''
said
Dixey
.
``
And
as
for
Old
Maid
*NL*
Pyncheon
,
take
my
word
for
it
,
she
has
run
in
debt
,
and
gone
off
from
*NL*
her
creditors
.
I
foretold
,
you
remember
,
the
first
morning
she
set
up
*NL*
shop
,
that
her
devilish
scowl
would
frighten
away
customers
.
They
*NL*
could
n't
stand
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
thought
she
'd
make
it
go
,
''
remarked
his
friend
.
``
This
*NL*
business
of
cent-shops
is
overdone
among
the
women-folks
.
My
wife
*NL*
tried
it
,
and
lost
five
dollars
on
her
outlay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
business
!
''
said
Dixey
,
shaking
his
head
.
``
Poor
business
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
the
morning
,
there
were
various
other
attempts
to
open
*NL*
a
communication
with
the
supposed
inhabitants
of
this
silent
and
*NL*
impenetrable
mansion
.
The
man
of
root-beer
came
,
in
his
neatly
painted
*NL*
wagon
,
with
a
couple
of
dozen
full
bottles
,
to
be
exchanged
for
empty
*NL*
ones
;
the
baker
,
with
a
lot
of
crackers
which
Hepzibah
had
ordered
for
*NL*
her
retail
custom
;
the
butcher
,
with
a
nice
titbit
which
he
fancied
she
*NL*
would
be
eager
to
secure
for
Clifford
.
Had
any
observer
of
these
*NL*
proceedings
been
aware
of
the
fearful
secret
hidden
within
the
house
,
*NL*
it
would
have
affected
him
with
a
singular
shape
and
modification
of
*NL*
horror
,
to
see
the
current
of
human
life
making
this
small
eddy
*NL*
hereabouts
,
--
whirling
sticks
,
straws
and
all
such
trifles
,
round
and
*NL*
round
,
right
over
the
black
depth
where
a
dead
corpse
lay
unseen
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
butcher
was
so
much
in
earnest
with
his
sweetbread
of
lamb
,
or
*NL*
whatever
the
dainty
might
be
,
that
he
tried
every
accessible
door
of
*NL*
the
Seven
Gables
,
and
at
length
came
round
again
to
the
shop
,
where
he
*NL*
ordinarily
found
admittance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
nice
article
,
and
I
know
the
old
lady
would
jump
at
it
,
''
said
*NL*
he
to
himself
.
``
She
ca
n't
be
gone
away
!
In
fifteen
years
that
I
have
*NL*
driven
my
cart
through
Pyncheon
Street
,
I
've
never
known
her
to
be
away
*NL*
from
home
;
though
often
enough
,
to
be
sure
,
a
man
might
knock
all
day
*NL*
without
bringing
her
to
the
door
.
But
that
was
when
she
'd
only
herself
*NL*
to
provide
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peeping
through
the
same
crevice
of
the
curtain
where
,
only
a
little
*NL*
while
before
,
the
urchin
of
elephantine
appetite
had
peeped
,
the
*NL*
butcher
beheld
the
inner
door
,
not
closed
,
as
the
child
had
seen
it
,
*NL*
but
ajar
,
and
almost
wide
open
.
However
it
might
have
happened
,
it
was
*NL*
the
fact
.
Through
the
passage-way
there
was
a
dark
vista
into
the
*NL*
lighter
but
still
obscure
interior
of
the
parlor
.
It
appeared
to
the
*NL*
butcher
that
he
could
pretty
clearly
discern
what
seemed
to
be
the
*NL*
stalwart
legs
,
clad
in
black
pantaloons
,
of
a
man
sitting
in
a
large
*NL*
oaken
chair
,
the
back
of
which
concealed
all
the
remainder
of
his
*NL*
figure
.
This
contemptuous
tranquillity
on
the
part
of
an
occupant
of
*NL*
the
house
,
in
response
to
the
butcher
's
indefatigable
efforts
to
*NL*
attract
notice
,
so
piqued
the
man
of
flesh
that
he
determined
to
*NL*
withdraw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
thought
he
,
``
there
sits
Old
Maid
Pyncheon
's
bloody
brother
,
while
*NL*
I
've
been
giving
myself
all
this
trouble
!
Why
,
if
a
hog
had
n't
more
*NL*
manners
,
I
'd
stick
him
!
I
call
it
demeaning
a
man
's
business
to
trade
*NL*
with
such
people
;
and
from
this
time
forth
,
if
they
want
a
sausage
or
*NL*
an
ounce
of
liver
,
they
shall
run
after
the
cart
for
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tossed
the
titbit
angrily
into
his
cart
,
and
drove
off
in
a
pet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
great
while
afterwards
there
was
a
sound
of
music
turning
the
*NL*
corner
and
approaching
down
the
street
,
with
several
intervals
of
*NL*
silence
,
and
then
a
renewed
and
nearer
outbreak
of
brisk
melody
.
A
mob
*NL*
of
children
was
seen
moving
onward
,
or
stopping
,
in
unison
with
the
*NL*
sound
,
which
appeared
to
proceed
from
the
centre
of
the
throng
;
so
that
*NL*
they
were
loosely
bound
together
by
slender
strains
of
harmony
,
and
*NL*
drawn
along
captive
;
with
ever
and
anon
an
accession
of
some
little
*NL*
fellow
in
an
apron
and
straw-hat
,
capering
forth
from
door
or
gateway
.
*NL*
Arriving
under
the
shadow
of
the
Pyncheon
Elm
,
it
proved
to
be
the
*NL*
Italian
boy
,
who
,
with
his
monkey
and
show
of
puppets
,
had
once
before
*NL*
played
his
hurdy-gurdy
beneath
the
arched
window
.
The
pleasant
face
of
*NL*
Phoebe
--
and
doubtless
,
too
,
the
liberal
recompense
which
she
had
flung
*NL*
him
--
still
dwelt
in
his
remembrance
.
His
expressive
features
kindled
*NL*
up
,
as
he
recognized
the
spot
where
this
trifling
incident
of
his
*NL*
erratic
life
had
chanced
.
He
entered
the
neglected
yard
-LRB-
now
wilder
*NL*
than
ever
,
with
its
growth
of
hog-weed
and
burdock
-RRB-
,
stationed
himself
*NL*
on
the
doorstep
of
the
main
entrance
,
and
,
opening
his
show-box
,
began
*NL*
to
play
.
Each
individual
of
the
automatic
community
forthwith
set
to
*NL*
work
,
according
to
his
or
her
proper
vocation
:
the
monkey
,
taking
off
*NL*
his
Highland
bonnet
,
bowed
and
scraped
to
the
by-standers
most
*NL*
obsequiously
,
with
ever
an
observant
eye
to
pick
up
a
stray
cent
;
and
*NL*
the
young
foreigner
himself
,
as
he
turned
the
crank
of
his
machine
,
*NL*
glanced
upward
to
the
arched
window
,
expectant
of
a
presence
that
would
*NL*
make
his
music
the
livelier
and
sweeter
.
The
throng
of
children
stood
*NL*
near
;
some
on
the
sidewalk
;
some
within
the
yard
;
two
or
three
*NL*
establishing
themselves
on
the
very
door-step
;
and
one
squatting
on
the
*NL*
threshold
.
Meanwhile
,
the
locust
kept
singing
in
the
great
old
*NL*
Pyncheon
Elm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
hear
anybody
in
the
house
,
''
said
one
of
the
children
to
*NL*
another
.
``
The
monkey
wo
n't
pick
up
anything
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
somebody
at
home
,
''
affirmed
the
urchin
on
the
threshold
.
``
I
*NL*
heard
a
step
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
young
Italian
's
eye
turned
sidelong
upward
;
and
it
really
*NL*
seemed
as
if
the
touch
of
genuine
,
though
slight
and
almost
playful
,
*NL*
emotion
communicated
a
juicier
sweetness
to
the
dry
,
mechanical
process
*NL*
of
his
minstrelsy
.
These
wanderers
are
readily
responsive
to
any
*NL*
natural
kindness
--
be
it
no
more
than
a
smile
,
or
a
word
itself
not
*NL*
understood
,
but
only
a
warmth
in
it
--
which
befalls
them
on
the
roadside
*NL*
of
life
.
They
remember
these
things
,
because
they
are
the
little
*NL*
enchantments
which
,
for
the
instant
,
--
for
the
space
that
reflects
a
*NL*
landscape
in
a
soap-bubble
,
--
build
up
a
home
about
them
.
Therefore
,
*NL*
the
Italian
boy
would
not
be
discouraged
by
the
heavy
silence
with
*NL*
which
the
old
house
seemed
resolute
to
clog
the
vivacity
of
his
*NL*
instrument
.
He
persisted
in
his
melodious
appeals
;
he
still
looked
*NL*
upward
,
trusting
that
his
dark
,
alien
countenance
would
soon
be
*NL*
brightened
by
Phoebe
's
sunny
aspect
.
Neither
could
he
be
willing
to
*NL*
depart
without
again
beholding
Clifford
,
whose
sensibility
,
like
*NL*
Phoebe
's
smile
,
had
talked
a
kind
of
heart
's
language
to
the
foreigner
.
*NL*
He
repeated
all
his
music
over
and
over
again
,
until
his
auditors
were
*NL*
getting
weary
.
So
were
the
little
wooden
people
in
his
show-box
,
and
*NL*
the
monkey
most
of
all
.
There
was
no
response
,
save
the
singing
of
the
*NL*
locust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
children
live
in
this
house
,
''
said
a
schoolboy
,
at
last
.
``
Nobody
*NL*
lives
here
but
an
old
maid
and
an
old
man
.
You
'll
get
nothing
here
!
*NL*
Why
do
n't
you
go
along
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
fool
,
you
,
why
do
you
tell
him
?
''
whispered
a
shrewd
little
Yankee
,
*NL*
caring
nothing
for
the
music
,
but
a
good
deal
for
the
cheap
rate
at
*NL*
which
it
was
had
.
``
Let
him
play
as
he
likes
!
If
there
's
nobody
to
pay
*NL*
him
,
that
's
his
own
lookout
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
,
however
,
the
Italian
ran
over
his
round
of
melodies
.
To
the
*NL*
common
observer
--
who
could
understand
nothing
of
the
case
,
except
the
*NL*
music
and
the
sunshine
on
the
hither
side
of
the
door
--
it
might
have
*NL*
been
amusing
to
watch
the
pertinacity
of
the
street-performer
.
Will
he
*NL*
succeed
at
last
?
Will
that
stubborn
door
be
suddenly
flung
open
?
Will
a
*NL*
group
of
joyous
children
,
the
young
ones
of
the
house
,
come
dancing
,
*NL*
shouting
,
laughing
,
into
the
open
air
,
and
cluster
round
the
show-box
,
*NL*
looking
with
eager
merriment
at
the
puppets
,
and
tossing
each
a
copper
*NL*
for
long-tailed
Mammon
,
the
monkey
,
to
pick
up
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
us
,
who
know
the
inner
heart
of
the
Seven
Gables
as
well
as
its
*NL*
exterior
face
,
there
is
a
ghastly
effect
in
this
repetition
of
light
*NL*
popular
tunes
at
its
door-step
.
It
would
be
an
ugly
business
,
indeed
,
*NL*
if
Judge
Pyncheon
-LRB-
who
would
not
have
cared
a
fig
for
Paganini
's
fiddle
*NL*
in
his
most
harmonious
mood
-RRB-
should
make
his
appearance
at
the
door
,
*NL*
with
a
bloody
shirt-bosom
,
and
a
grim
frown
on
his
swarthily
white
*NL*
visage
,
and
motion
the
foreign
vagabond
away
!
Was
ever
before
such
a
*NL*
grinding
out
of
jigs
and
waltzes
,
where
nobody
was
in
the
cue
to
dance
?
*NL*
Yes
,
very
often
.
This
contrast
,
or
intermingling
of
tragedy
with
mirth
,
*NL*
happens
daily
,
hourly
,
momently
.
The
gloomy
and
desolate
old
house
,
*NL*
deserted
of
life
,
and
with
awful
Death
sitting
sternly
in
its
solitude
,
*NL*
was
the
emblem
of
many
a
human
heart
,
which
,
nevertheless
,
is
compelled
*NL*
to
hear
the
thrill
and
echo
of
the
world
's
gayety
around
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
conclusion
of
the
Italian
's
performance
,
a
couple
of
men
*NL*
happened
to
be
passing
,
On
their
way
to
dinner
.
``
I
say
,
you
young
*NL*
French
fellow
!
''
called
out
one
of
them
,
--
``
come
away
from
that
doorstep
,
*NL*
and
go
somewhere
else
with
your
nonsense
!
The
Pyncheon
family
live
*NL*
there
;
and
they
are
in
great
trouble
,
just
about
this
time
.
They
do
n't
*NL*
feel
musical
to-day
.
It
is
reported
all
over
town
that
Judge
Pyncheon
,
*NL*
who
owns
the
house
,
has
been
murdered
;
and
the
city
marshal
is
going
to
*NL*
look
into
the
matter
.
So
be
off
with
you
,
at
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Italian
shouldered
his
hurdy-gurdy
,
he
saw
on
the
doorstep
a
*NL*
card
,
which
had
been
covered
,
all
the
morning
,
by
the
newspaper
that
*NL*
the
carrier
had
flung
upon
it
,
but
was
now
shuffled
into
sight
.
He
*NL*
picked
it
up
,
and
perceiving
something
written
in
pencil
,
gave
it
to
*NL*
the
man
to
read
.
In
fact
,
it
was
an
engraved
card
of
Judge
Pyncheon
's
*NL*
with
certain
pencilled
memoranda
on
the
back
,
referring
to
various
*NL*
businesses
which
it
had
been
his
purpose
to
transact
during
the
*NL*
preceding
day
.
It
formed
a
prospective
epitome
of
the
day
's
history
;
*NL*
only
that
affairs
had
not
turned
out
altogether
in
accordance
with
the
*NL*
programme
.
The
card
must
have
been
lost
from
the
Judge
's
vest-pocket
*NL*
in
his
preliminary
attempt
to
gain
access
by
the
main
entrance
of
the
*NL*
house
.
Though
well
soaked
with
rain
,
it
was
still
partially
legible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
;
Dixey
!
''
cried
the
man
.
``
This
has
something
to
do
with
*NL*
Judge
Pyncheon
.
See
!
--
here
's
his
name
printed
on
it
;
and
here
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
is
some
of
his
handwriting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
to
the
city
marshal
with
it
!
''
said
Dixey
.
``
It
may
give
him
*NL*
just
the
clew
he
wants
.
After
all
,
''
whispered
he
in
his
companion
's
*NL*
ear
,
``
it
would
be
no
wonder
if
the
Judge
has
gone
into
that
door
and
*NL*
never
come
out
again
!
A
certain
cousin
of
his
may
have
been
at
his
old
*NL*
tricks
.
And
Old
Maid
Pyncheon
having
got
herself
in
debt
by
the
*NL*
cent-shop
,
--
and
the
Judge
's
pocket-book
being
well
filled
,
--
and
bad
*NL*
blood
amongst
them
already
!
Put
all
these
things
together
and
see
what
*NL*
they
make
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
hush
!
''
whispered
the
other
.
``
It
seems
like
a
sin
to
be
the
*NL*
first
to
speak
of
such
a
thing
.
But
I
think
,
with
you
,
that
we
had
*NL*
better
go
to
the
city
marshal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
said
Dixey
.
``
Well
!
--
I
always
said
there
was
something
*NL*
devilish
in
that
woman
's
scowl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
wheeled
about
,
accordingly
,
and
retraced
their
steps
up
the
*NL*
street
.
The
Italian
,
also
,
made
the
best
of
his
way
off
,
with
a
*NL*
parting
glance
up
at
the
arched
window
.
As
for
the
children
,
they
took
*NL*
to
their
heels
,
with
one
accord
,
and
scampered
as
if
some
giant
or
ogre
*NL*
were
in
pursuit
,
until
,
at
a
good
distance
from
the
house
,
they
stopped
*NL*
as
suddenly
and
simultaneously
as
they
had
set
out
.
Their
susceptible
*NL*
nerves
took
an
indefinite
alarm
from
what
they
had
overheard
.
Looking
*NL*
back
at
the
grotesque
peaks
and
shadowy
angles
of
the
old
mansion
,
they
*NL*
fancied
a
gloom
diffused
about
it
which
no
brightness
of
the
sunshine
*NL*
could
dispel
.
An
imaginary
Hepzibah
scowled
and
shook
her
finger
at
*NL*
them
,
from
several
windows
at
the
same
moment
.
An
imaginary
*NL*
Clifford
--
for
-LRB-
and
it
would
have
deeply
wounded
him
to
know
it
-RRB-
he
had
*NL*
always
been
a
horror
to
these
small
people
--
stood
behind
the
unreal
*NL*
Hepzibah
,
making
awful
gestures
,
in
a
faded
dressing-gown
.
Children
*NL*
are
even
more
apt
,
if
possible
,
than
grown
people
,
to
catch
the
*NL*
contagion
of
a
panic
terror
.
For
the
rest
of
the
day
,
the
more
timid
*NL*
went
whole
streets
about
,
for
the
sake
of
avoiding
the
Seven
Gables
;
*NL*
while
the
bolder
signalized
their
hardihood
by
challenging
their
*NL*
comrades
to
race
past
the
mansion
at
full
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
could
not
have
been
more
than
half
an
hour
after
the
disappearance
*NL*
of
the
Italian
boy
,
with
his
unseasonable
melodies
,
when
a
cab
drove
*NL*
down
the
street
.
It
stopped
beneath
the
Pyncheon
Elm
;
the
cabman
took
*NL*
a
trunk
,
a
canvas
bag
,
and
a
bandbox
,
from
the
top
of
his
vehicle
,
and
*NL*
deposited
them
on
the
doorstep
of
the
old
house
;
a
straw
bonnet
,
and
*NL*
then
the
pretty
figure
of
a
young
girl
,
came
into
view
from
the
*NL*
interior
of
the
cab
.
It
was
Phoebe
!
Though
not
altogether
so
blooming
*NL*
as
when
she
first
tripped
into
our
story
,
--
for
,
in
the
few
intervening
*NL*
weeks
,
her
experiences
had
made
her
graver
,
more
womanly
,
and
*NL*
deeper-eyed
,
in
token
of
a
heart
that
had
begun
to
suspect
its
*NL*
depths
,
--
still
there
was
the
quiet
glow
of
natural
sunshine
over
her
.
*NL*
Neither
had
she
forfeited
her
proper
gift
of
making
things
look
real
,
*NL*
rather
than
fantastic
,
within
her
sphere
.
Yet
we
feel
it
to
be
a
*NL*
questionable
venture
,
even
for
Phoebe
,
at
this
juncture
,
to
cross
the
*NL*
threshold
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
Is
her
healthful
presence
potent
enough
*NL*
to
chase
away
the
crowd
of
pale
,
hideous
,
and
sinful
phantoms
,
that
*NL*
have
gained
admittance
there
since
her
departure
?
Or
will
she
,
*NL*
likewise
,
fade
,
sicken
,
sadden
,
and
grow
into
deformity
,
and
be
only
*NL*
another
pallid
phantom
,
to
glide
noiselessly
up
and
down
the
stairs
,
*NL*
and
affright
children
as
she
pauses
at
the
window
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
least
,
we
would
gladly
forewarn
the
unsuspecting
girl
that
there
is
*NL*
nothing
in
human
shape
or
substance
to
receive
her
,
unless
it
be
the
*NL*
figure
of
Judge
Pyncheon
,
who
--
wretched
spectacle
that
he
is
,
and
*NL*
frightful
in
our
remembrance
,
since
our
night-long
vigil
with
*NL*
him
!
--
still
keeps
his
place
in
the
oaken
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Phoebe
first
tried
the
shop-door
.
It
did
not
yield
to
her
hand
;
and
*NL*
the
white
curtain
,
drawn
across
the
window
which
formed
the
upper
*NL*
section
of
the
door
,
struck
her
quick
perceptive
faculty
as
something
*NL*
unusual
.
Without
making
another
effort
to
enter
here
,
she
betook
*NL*
herself
to
the
great
portal
,
under
the
arched
window
.
Finding
it
*NL*
fastened
,
she
knocked
.
A
reverberation
came
from
the
emptiness
within
.
*NL*
She
knocked
again
,
and
a
third
time
;
and
,
listening
intently
,
fancied
*NL*
that
the
floor
creaked
,
as
if
Hepzibah
were
coming
,
with
her
ordinary
*NL*
tiptoe
movement
,
to
admit
her
.
But
so
dead
a
silence
ensued
upon
this
*NL*
imaginary
sound
,
that
she
began
to
question
whether
she
might
not
have
*NL*
mistaken
the
house
,
familiar
as
she
thought
herself
with
its
exterior
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
notice
was
now
attracted
by
a
child
's
voice
,
at
some
distance
.
It
*NL*
appeared
to
call
her
name
.
Looking
in
the
direction
whence
it
*NL*
proceeded
,
Phoebe
saw
little
Ned
Higgins
,
a
good
way
down
the
street
,
*NL*
stamping
,
shaking
his
head
violently
,
making
deprecatory
gestures
with
*NL*
both
hands
,
and
shouting
to
her
at
mouth-wide
screech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Phoebe
!
''
he
screamed
.
``
Do
n't
you
go
in
!
There
's
something
*NL*
wicked
there
!
Do
n't
--
do
n't
--
do
n't
go
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
the
little
personage
could
not
be
induced
to
approach
near
*NL*
enough
to
explain
himself
,
Phoebe
concluded
that
he
had
been
*NL*
frightened
,
on
some
of
his
visits
to
the
shop
,
by
her
cousin
Hepzibah
;
*NL*
for
the
good
lady
's
manifestations
,
in
truth
,
ran
about
an
equal
chance
*NL*
of
scaring
children
out
of
their
wits
,
or
compelling
them
to
unseemly
*NL*
laughter
.
Still
,
she
felt
the
more
,
for
this
incident
,
how
*NL*
unaccountably
silent
and
impenetrable
the
house
had
become
.
As
her
*NL*
next
resort
,
Phoebe
made
her
way
into
the
garden
,
where
on
so
warm
and
*NL*
bright
a
day
as
the
present
,
she
had
little
doubt
of
finding
Clifford
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
Hepzibah
also
,
idling
away
the
noontide
in
the
shadow
of
*NL*
the
arbor
.
Immediately
on
her
entering
the
garden
gate
,
the
family
of
*NL*
hens
half
ran
,
half
flew
to
meet
her
;
while
a
strange
grimalkin
,
which
*NL*
was
prowling
under
the
parlor
window
,
took
to
his
heels
,
clambered
*NL*
hastily
over
the
fence
,
and
vanished
.
The
arbor
was
vacant
,
and
its
*NL*
floor
,
table
,
and
circular
bench
were
still
damp
,
and
bestrewn
with
*NL*
twigs
and
the
disarray
of
the
past
storm
.
The
growth
of
the
garden
*NL*
seemed
to
have
got
quite
out
of
bounds
;
the
weeds
had
taken
advantage
*NL*
of
Phoebe
's
absence
,
and
the
long-continued
rain
,
to
run
rampant
over
*NL*
the
flowers
and
kitchen-vegetables
.
Maule
's
well
had
overflowed
its
*NL*
stone
border
,
and
made
a
pool
of
formidable
breadth
in
that
corner
of
*NL*
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
impression
of
the
whole
scene
was
that
of
a
spot
where
no
human
*NL*
foot
had
left
its
print
for
many
preceding
days
,
--
probably
not
since
*NL*
Phoebe
's
departure
,
--
for
she
saw
a
side-comb
of
her
own
under
the
table
*NL*
of
the
arbor
,
where
it
must
have
fallen
on
the
last
afternoon
when
she
*NL*
and
Clifford
sat
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
knew
that
her
two
relatives
were
capable
of
far
greater
*NL*
oddities
than
that
of
shutting
themselves
up
in
their
old
house
,
as
*NL*
they
appeared
now
to
have
done
.
Nevertheless
,
with
indistinct
*NL*
misgivings
of
something
amiss
,
and
apprehensions
to
which
she
could
not
*NL*
give
shape
,
she
approached
the
door
that
formed
the
customary
*NL*
communication
between
the
house
and
garden
.
It
was
secured
within
,
*NL*
like
the
two
which
she
had
already
tried
.
She
knocked
,
however
;
and
*NL*
immediately
,
as
if
the
application
had
been
expected
,
the
door
was
*NL*
drawn
open
,
by
a
considerable
exertion
of
some
unseen
person
's
*NL*
strength
,
not
wide
,
but
far
enough
to
afford
her
a
sidelong
entrance
.
*NL*
As
Hepzibah
,
in
order
not
to
expose
herself
to
inspection
from
without
,
*NL*
invariably
opened
a
door
in
this
manner
,
Phoebe
necessarily
concluded
*NL*
that
it
was
her
cousin
who
now
admitted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
hesitation
,
therefore
,
she
stepped
across
the
threshold
,
and
*NL*
had
no
sooner
entered
than
the
door
closed
behind
her
.

XX
The
Flower
of
Eden
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
PHOEBE
,
coming
so
suddenly
from
the
sunny
daylight
,
was
altogether
*NL*
bedimmed
in
such
density
of
shadow
as
lurked
in
most
of
the
passages
of
*NL*
the
old
house
.
She
was
not
at
first
aware
by
whom
she
had
been
*NL*
admitted
.
Before
her
eyes
had
adapted
themselves
to
the
obscurity
,
a
*NL*
hand
grasped
her
own
with
a
firm
but
gentle
and
warm
pressure
,
thus
*NL*
imparting
a
welcome
which
caused
her
heart
to
leap
and
thrill
with
an
*NL*
indefinable
shiver
of
enjoyment
.
She
felt
herself
drawn
along
,
not
*NL*
towards
the
parlor
,
but
into
a
large
and
unoccupied
apartment
,
which
*NL*
had
formerly
been
the
grand
reception-room
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
The
*NL*
sunshine
came
freely
into
all
the
uncurtained
windows
of
this
room
,
and
*NL*
fell
upon
the
dusty
floor
;
so
that
Phoebe
now
clearly
saw
--
what
,
*NL*
indeed
,
had
been
no
secret
,
after
the
encounter
of
a
warm
hand
with
*NL*
hers
--
that
it
was
not
Hepzibah
nor
Clifford
,
but
Holgrave
,
to
whom
she
*NL*
owed
her
reception
.
The
subtile
,
intuitive
communication
,
or
,
rather
,
*NL*
the
vague
and
formless
impression
of
something
to
be
told
,
had
made
her
*NL*
yield
unresistingly
to
his
impulse
.
Without
taking
away
her
hand
,
she
*NL*
looked
eagerly
in
his
face
,
not
quick
to
forebode
evil
,
but
unavoidably
*NL*
conscious
that
the
state
of
the
family
had
changed
since
her
departure
,
*NL*
and
therefore
anxious
for
an
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
artist
looked
paler
than
ordinary
;
there
was
a
thoughtful
and
*NL*
severe
contraction
of
his
forehead
,
tracing
a
deep
,
vertical
line
*NL*
between
the
eyebrows
.
His
smile
,
however
,
was
full
of
genuine
warmth
,
*NL*
and
had
in
it
a
joy
,
by
far
the
most
vivid
expression
that
Phoebe
had
*NL*
ever
witnessed
,
shining
out
of
the
New
England
reserve
with
which
*NL*
Holgrave
habitually
masked
whatever
lay
near
his
heart
.
It
was
the
*NL*
look
wherewith
a
man
,
brooding
alone
over
some
fearful
object
,
in
a
*NL*
dreary
forest
or
illimitable
desert
,
would
recognize
the
familiar
*NL*
aspect
of
his
dearest
friend
,
bringing
up
all
the
peaceful
ideas
that
*NL*
belong
to
home
,
and
the
gentle
current
of
every-day
affairs
.
And
yet
,
*NL*
as
he
felt
the
necessity
of
responding
to
her
look
of
inquiry
,
the
*NL*
smile
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
not
to
rejoice
that
you
have
come
,
Phoebe
,
''
said
he
.
``
We
meet
*NL*
at
a
strange
moment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
Why
is
the
house
so
deserted
?
*NL*
Where
are
Hepzibah
and
Clifford
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
!
I
can
not
imagine
where
they
are
!
''
answered
Holgrave
.
``
We
are
*NL*
alone
in
the
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hepzibah
and
Clifford
gone
?
''
cried
Phoebe
.
``
It
is
not
possible
!
And
*NL*
why
have
you
brought
me
into
this
room
,
instead
of
the
parlor
?
Ah
,
*NL*
something
terrible
has
happened
!
I
must
run
and
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Phoebe
!
''
said
Holgrave
holding
her
back
.
``
It
is
as
I
have
*NL*
told
you
.
They
are
gone
,
and
I
know
not
whither
.
A
terrible
event
*NL*
has
,
indeed
happened
,
but
not
to
them
,
nor
,
as
I
undoubtingly
believe
,
*NL*
through
any
agency
of
theirs
.
If
I
read
your
character
rightly
,
*NL*
Phoebe
,
''
he
continued
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
hers
with
stern
anxiety
,
*NL*
intermixed
with
tenderness
,
``
gentle
as
you
are
,
and
seeming
to
have
*NL*
your
sphere
among
common
things
,
you
yet
possess
remarkable
strength
.
*NL*
You
have
wonderful
poise
,
and
a
faculty
which
,
when
tested
,
will
prove
*NL*
itself
capable
of
dealing
with
matters
that
fall
far
out
of
the
*NL*
ordinary
rule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
am
very
weak
!
''
replied
Phoebe
,
trembling
.
``
But
tell
me
what
*NL*
has
happened
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
strong
!
''
persisted
Holgrave
.
``
You
must
be
both
strong
and
*NL*
wise
;
for
I
am
all
astray
,
and
need
your
counsel
.
It
may
be
you
can
*NL*
suggest
the
one
right
thing
to
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
!
--
tell
me
!
''
said
Phoebe
,
all
in
a
tremble
.
``
It
oppresses
,
--
it
*NL*
terrifies
me
,
--
this
mystery
!
Anything
else
I
can
bear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
artist
hesitated
.
Notwithstanding
what
he
had
just
said
,
and
most
*NL*
sincerely
,
in
regard
to
the
self-balancing
power
with
which
Phoebe
*NL*
impressed
him
,
it
still
seemed
almost
wicked
to
bring
the
awful
secret
*NL*
of
yesterday
to
her
knowledge
.
It
was
like
dragging
a
hideous
shape
of
*NL*
death
into
the
cleanly
and
cheerful
space
before
a
household
fire
,
*NL*
where
it
would
present
all
the
uglier
aspect
,
amid
the
decorousness
of
*NL*
everything
about
it
.
Yet
it
could
not
be
concealed
from
her
;
she
must
*NL*
needs
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoebe
,
''
said
he
,
``
do
you
remember
this
?
''
He
put
into
her
hand
a
*NL*
daguerreotype
;
the
same
that
he
had
shown
her
at
their
first
interview
*NL*
in
the
garden
,
and
which
so
strikingly
brought
out
the
hard
and
*NL*
relentless
traits
of
the
original
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
this
to
do
with
Hepzibah
and
Clifford
?
''
asked
Phoebe
,
with
*NL*
impatient
surprise
that
Holgrave
should
so
trifle
with
her
at
such
a
*NL*
moment
.
``
It
is
Judge
Pyncheon
!
You
have
shown
it
to
me
before
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
here
is
the
same
face
,
taken
within
this
half-hour
''
said
the
*NL*
artist
,
presenting
her
with
another
miniature
.
``
I
had
just
finished
it
*NL*
when
I
heard
you
at
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
death
!
''
shuddered
Phoebe
,
turning
very
pale
.
``
Judge
Pyncheon
*NL*
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
as
there
represented
,
''
said
Holgrave
,
``
he
sits
in
the
next
room
.
*NL*
The
Judge
is
dead
,
and
Clifford
and
Hepzibah
have
vanished
!
I
know
no
*NL*
more
.
All
beyond
is
conjecture
.
On
returning
to
my
solitary
chamber
,
*NL*
last
evening
,
I
noticed
no
light
,
either
in
the
parlor
,
or
Hepzibah
's
*NL*
room
,
or
Clifford
's
;
no
stir
nor
footstep
about
the
house
.
This
*NL*
morning
,
there
was
the
same
death-like
quiet
.
From
my
window
,
I
*NL*
overheard
the
testimony
of
a
neighbor
,
that
your
relatives
were
seen
*NL*
leaving
the
house
in
the
midst
of
yesterday
's
storm
.
A
rumor
reached
*NL*
me
,
too
,
of
Judge
Pyncheon
being
missed
.
A
feeling
which
I
can
not
*NL*
describe
--
an
indefinite
sense
of
some
catastrophe
,
or
*NL*
consummation
--
impelled
me
to
make
my
way
into
this
part
of
the
house
,
*NL*
where
I
discovered
what
you
see
.
As
a
point
of
evidence
that
may
be
*NL*
useful
to
Clifford
,
and
also
as
a
memorial
valuable
to
myself
,
--
for
,
*NL*
Phoebe
,
there
are
hereditary
reasons
that
connect
me
strangely
with
*NL*
that
man
's
fate
,
--
I
used
the
means
at
my
disposal
to
preserve
this
*NL*
pictorial
record
of
Judge
Pyncheon
's
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
in
her
agitation
,
Phoebe
could
not
help
remarking
the
calmness
of
*NL*
Holgrave
's
demeanor
.
He
appeared
,
it
is
true
,
to
feel
the
whole
*NL*
awfulness
of
the
Judge
's
death
,
yet
had
received
the
fact
into
his
mind
*NL*
without
any
mixture
of
surprise
,
but
as
an
event
preordained
,
happening
*NL*
inevitably
,
and
so
fitting
itself
into
past
occurrences
that
it
could
*NL*
almost
have
been
prophesied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
not
thrown
open
the
doors
,
and
called
in
witnesses
?
''
*NL*
inquired
she
with
a
painful
shudder
.
``
It
is
terrible
to
be
here
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Clifford
!
''
suggested
the
artist
.
``
Clifford
and
Hepzibah
!
We
must
*NL*
consider
what
is
best
to
be
done
in
their
behalf
.
It
is
a
wretched
*NL*
fatality
that
they
should
have
disappeared
!
Their
flight
will
throw
the
*NL*
worst
coloring
over
this
event
of
which
it
is
susceptible
.
Yet
how
*NL*
easy
is
the
explanation
,
to
those
who
know
them
!
Bewildered
and
*NL*
terror-stricken
by
the
similarity
of
this
death
to
a
former
one
,
which
*NL*
was
attended
with
such
disastrous
consequences
to
Clifford
,
they
have
*NL*
had
no
idea
but
of
removing
themselves
from
the
scene
.
How
miserably
*NL*
unfortunate
!
Had
Hepzibah
but
shrieked
aloud
,
--
had
Clifford
flung
wide
*NL*
the
door
,
and
proclaimed
Judge
Pyncheon
's
death
,
--
it
would
have
been
,
*NL*
however
awful
in
itself
,
an
event
fruitful
of
good
consequences
to
*NL*
them
.
As
I
view
it
,
it
would
have
gone
far
towards
obliterating
the
*NL*
black
stain
on
Clifford
's
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
,
''
asked
Phoebe
,
``
could
any
good
come
from
what
is
so
very
*NL*
dreadful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
said
the
artist
,
``
if
the
matter
can
be
fairly
considered
and
*NL*
candidly
interpreted
,
it
must
be
evident
that
Judge
Pyncheon
could
not
*NL*
have
come
unfairly
to
his
end
.
This
mode
of
death
had
been
an
*NL*
idiosyncrasy
with
his
family
,
for
generations
past
;
not
often
*NL*
occurring
,
indeed
,
but
,
when
it
does
occur
,
usually
attacking
*NL*
individuals
about
the
Judge
's
time
of
life
,
and
generally
in
the
*NL*
tension
of
some
mental
crisis
,
or
,
perhaps
,
in
an
access
of
wrath
.
Old
*NL*
Maule
's
prophecy
was
probably
founded
on
a
knowledge
of
this
physical
*NL*
predisposition
in
the
Pyncheon
race
.
Now
,
there
is
a
minute
and
almost
*NL*
exact
similarity
in
the
appearances
connected
with
the
death
that
*NL*
occurred
yesterday
and
those
recorded
of
the
death
of
Clifford
's
uncle
*NL*
thirty
years
ago
.
It
is
true
,
there
was
a
certain
arrangement
of
*NL*
circumstances
,
unnecessary
to
be
recounted
,
which
made
it
possible
nay
,
*NL*
as
men
look
at
these
things
,
probable
,
or
even
certain
--
that
old
*NL*
Jaffrey
Pyncheon
came
to
a
violent
death
,
and
by
Clifford
's
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whence
came
those
circumstances
?
''
exclaimed
Phoebe
.
``
He
being
*NL*
innocent
,
as
we
know
him
to
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
arranged
,
''
said
Holgrave
,
--
``
at
least
such
has
long
been
my
*NL*
conviction
,
--
they
were
arranged
after
the
uncle
's
death
,
and
before
it
*NL*
was
made
public
,
by
the
man
who
sits
in
yonder
parlor
.
His
own
death
,
*NL*
so
like
that
former
one
,
yet
attended
by
none
of
those
suspicious
*NL*
circumstances
,
seems
the
stroke
of
God
upon
him
,
at
once
a
punishment
*NL*
for
his
wickedness
,
and
making
plain
the
innocence
of
Clifford
.
But
*NL*
this
flight
,
--
it
distorts
everything
!
He
may
be
in
concealment
,
near
at
*NL*
hand
.
Could
we
but
bring
him
back
before
the
discovery
of
the
Judge
's
*NL*
death
,
the
evil
might
be
rectified
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
not
hide
this
thing
a
moment
longer
!
''
said
Phoebe
.
``
It
is
*NL*
dreadful
to
keep
it
so
closely
in
our
hearts
.
Clifford
is
innocent
.
*NL*
God
will
make
it
manifest
!
Let
us
throw
open
the
doors
,
and
call
all
*NL*
the
neighborhood
to
see
the
truth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
Phoebe
,
''
rejoined
Holgrave
.
``
Doubtless
you
are
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
the
artist
did
not
feel
the
horror
,
which
was
proper
to
Phoebe
's
*NL*
sweet
and
order-loving
character
,
at
thus
finding
herself
at
issue
with
*NL*
society
,
and
brought
in
contact
with
an
event
that
transcended
ordinary
*NL*
rules
.
Neither
was
he
in
haste
,
like
her
,
to
betake
himself
within
the
*NL*
precincts
of
common
life
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
gathered
a
wild
*NL*
enjoyment
,
--
as
it
were
,
a
flower
of
strange
beauty
,
growing
in
a
*NL*
desolate
spot
,
and
blossoming
in
the
wind
,
--
such
a
flower
of
momentary
*NL*
happiness
he
gathered
from
his
present
position
.
It
separated
Phoebe
*NL*
and
himself
from
the
world
,
and
bound
them
to
each
other
,
by
their
*NL*
exclusive
knowledge
of
Judge
Pyncheon
's
mysterious
death
,
and
the
*NL*
counsel
which
they
were
forced
to
hold
respecting
it
.
The
secret
,
so
*NL*
long
as
it
should
continue
such
,
kept
them
within
the
circle
of
a
*NL*
spell
,
a
solitude
in
the
midst
of
men
,
a
remoteness
as
entire
as
that
*NL*
of
an
island
in
mid-ocean
;
once
divulged
,
the
ocean
would
flow
betwixt
*NL*
them
,
standing
on
its
widely
sundered
shores
.
Meanwhile
,
all
the
*NL*
circumstances
of
their
situation
seemed
to
draw
them
together
;
they
*NL*
were
like
two
children
who
go
hand
in
hand
,
pressing
closely
to
one
*NL*
another
's
side
,
through
a
shadow-haunted
passage
.
The
image
of
awful
*NL*
Death
,
which
filled
the
house
,
held
them
united
by
his
stiffened
grasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
influences
hastened
the
development
of
emotions
that
might
not
*NL*
otherwise
have
flowered
so
.
Possibly
,
indeed
,
it
had
been
Holgrave
's
*NL*
purpose
to
let
them
die
in
their
undeveloped
germs
.
``
Why
do
we
delay
*NL*
so
?
''
asked
Phoebe
.
``
This
secret
takes
away
my
breath
!
Let
us
throw
*NL*
open
the
doors
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
all
our
lives
there
can
never
come
another
moment
like
this
!
''
said
*NL*
Holgrave
.
``
Phoebe
,
is
it
all
terror
?
--
nothing
but
terror
?
Are
you
*NL*
conscious
of
no
joy
,
as
I
am
,
that
has
made
this
the
only
point
of
life
*NL*
worth
living
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
a
sin
,
''
replied
Phoebe
,
trembling
,
``
to
think
of
joy
at
such
a
*NL*
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
but
know
,
Phoebe
,
how
it
was
with
me
the
hour
before
you
*NL*
came
!
''
exclaimed
the
artist
.
``
A
dark
,
cold
,
miserable
hour
!
The
*NL*
presence
of
yonder
dead
man
threw
a
great
black
shadow
over
everything
;
*NL*
he
made
the
universe
,
so
far
as
my
perception
could
reach
,
a
scene
of
*NL*
guilt
and
of
retribution
more
dreadful
than
the
guilt
.
The
sense
of
it
*NL*
took
away
my
youth
.
I
never
hoped
to
feel
young
again
!
The
world
*NL*
looked
strange
,
wild
,
evil
,
hostile
;
my
past
life
,
so
lonesome
and
*NL*
dreary
;
my
future
,
a
shapeless
gloom
,
which
I
must
mould
into
gloomy
*NL*
shapes
!
But
,
Phoebe
,
you
crossed
the
threshold
;
and
hope
,
warmth
,
and
*NL*
joy
came
in
with
you
!
The
black
moment
became
at
once
a
blissful
one
.
*NL*
It
must
not
pass
without
the
spoken
word
.
I
love
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
love
a
simple
girl
like
me
?
''
asked
Phoebe
,
compelled
by
*NL*
his
earnestness
to
speak
.
``
You
have
many
,
many
thoughts
,
with
which
I
*NL*
should
try
in
vain
to
sympathize
.
And
I
,
--
I
,
too
,
--
I
have
tendencies
*NL*
with
which
you
would
sympathize
as
little
.
That
is
less
matter
.
But
I
*NL*
have
not
scope
enough
to
make
you
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
my
only
possibility
of
happiness
!
''
answered
Holgrave
.
``
I
have
*NL*
no
faith
in
it
,
except
as
you
bestow
it
on
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
--
I
am
afraid
!
''
continued
Phoebe
,
shrinking
towards
Holgrave
,
*NL*
even
while
she
told
him
so
frankly
the
doubts
with
which
he
affected
*NL*
her
.
``
You
will
lead
me
out
of
my
own
quiet
path
.
You
will
make
me
*NL*
strive
to
follow
you
where
it
is
pathless
.
I
can
not
do
so
.
It
is
not
*NL*
my
nature
.
I
shall
sink
down
and
perish
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Phoebe
!
''
exclaimed
Holgrave
,
with
almost
a
sigh
,
and
a
smile
that
*NL*
was
burdened
with
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
far
otherwise
than
as
you
forebode
.
The
world
owes
all
its
*NL*
onward
impulses
to
men
ill
at
ease
.
The
happy
man
inevitably
confines
*NL*
himself
within
ancient
limits
.
I
have
a
presentiment
that
,
hereafter
,
*NL*
it
will
be
my
lot
to
set
out
trees
,
to
make
fences
,
--
perhaps
,
even
,
in
*NL*
due
time
,
to
build
a
house
for
another
generation
,
--
in
a
word
,
to
*NL*
conform
myself
to
laws
and
the
peaceful
practice
of
society
.
Your
*NL*
poise
will
be
more
powerful
than
any
oscillating
tendency
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
have
it
so
!
''
said
Phoebe
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
love
me
?
''
asked
Holgrave
.
``
If
we
love
one
another
,
the
moment
*NL*
has
room
for
nothing
more
.
Let
us
pause
upon
it
,
and
be
satisfied
.
Do
*NL*
you
love
me
,
Phoebe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
into
my
heart
,
''
said
she
,
letting
her
eyes
drop
.
``
You
know
I
*NL*
love
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
in
this
hour
,
so
full
of
doubt
and
awe
,
that
the
one
miracle
*NL*
was
wrought
,
without
which
every
human
existence
is
a
blank
.
The
bliss
*NL*
which
makes
all
things
true
,
beautiful
,
and
holy
shone
around
this
*NL*
youth
and
maiden
.
They
were
conscious
of
nothing
sad
nor
old
.
They
*NL*
transfigured
the
earth
,
and
made
it
Eden
again
,
and
themselves
the
two
*NL*
first
dwellers
in
it
.
The
dead
man
,
so
close
beside
them
,
was
*NL*
forgotten
.
At
such
a
crisis
,
there
is
no
death
;
for
immortality
is
*NL*
revealed
anew
,
and
embraces
everything
in
its
hallowed
atmosphere
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
soon
the
heavy
earth-dream
settled
down
again
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
!
''
whispered
Phoebe
.
``
Somebody
is
at
the
street
door
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
us
meet
the
world
!
''
said
Holgrave
.
``
No
doubt
,
the
rumor
of
*NL*
Judge
Pyncheon
's
visit
to
this
house
,
and
the
flight
of
Hepzibah
and
*NL*
Clifford
,
is
about
to
lead
to
the
investigation
of
the
premises
.
We
*NL*
have
no
way
but
to
meet
it
.
Let
us
open
the
door
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
to
their
surprise
,
before
they
could
reach
the
street
door
,
--
even
*NL*
before
they
quitted
the
room
in
which
the
foregoing
interview
had
*NL*
passed
,
--
they
heard
footsteps
in
the
farther
passage
.
The
door
,
*NL*
therefore
,
which
they
supposed
to
be
securely
locked
,
--
which
Holgrave
,
*NL*
indeed
,
had
seen
to
be
so
,
and
at
which
Phoebe
had
vainly
tried
to
*NL*
enter
,
--
must
have
been
opened
from
without
.
The
sound
of
footsteps
was
*NL*
not
harsh
,
bold
,
decided
,
and
intrusive
,
as
the
gait
of
strangers
would
*NL*
naturally
be
,
making
authoritative
entrance
into
a
dwelling
where
they
*NL*
knew
themselves
unwelcome
.
It
was
feeble
,
as
of
persons
either
weak
or
*NL*
weary
;
there
was
the
mingled
murmur
of
two
voices
,
familiar
to
both
the
*NL*
listeners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
?
''
whispered
Holgrave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
they
!
''
answered
Phoebe
.
``
Thank
God
!
--
thank
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
as
if
in
sympathy
with
Phoebe
's
whispered
ejaculation
,
they
*NL*
heard
Hepzibah
's
voice
more
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
my
brother
,
we
are
at
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
--
Yes
!
--
thank
God
!
''
responded
Clifford
.
``
A
dreary
home
,
*NL*
Hepzibah
!
But
you
have
done
well
to
bring
me
hither
!
Stay
!
That
parlor
*NL*
door
is
open
.
I
can
not
pass
by
it
!
Let
me
go
and
rest
me
in
the
arbor
,
*NL*
where
I
used
,
--
oh
,
very
long
ago
,
it
seems
to
me
,
after
what
has
*NL*
befallen
us
,
--
where
I
used
to
be
so
happy
with
little
Phoebe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
house
was
not
altogether
so
dreary
as
Clifford
imagined
it
.
*NL*
They
had
not
made
many
steps
,
--
in
truth
,
they
were
lingering
in
the
*NL*
entry
,
with
the
listlessness
of
an
accomplished
purpose
,
uncertain
what
*NL*
to
do
next
,
--
when
Phoebe
ran
to
meet
them
.
On
beholding
her
,
Hepzibah
*NL*
burst
into
tears
.
With
all
her
might
,
she
had
staggered
onward
beneath
*NL*
the
burden
of
grief
and
responsibility
,
until
now
that
it
was
safe
to
*NL*
fling
it
down
.
Indeed
,
she
had
not
energy
to
fling
it
down
,
but
had
*NL*
ceased
to
uphold
it
,
and
suffered
it
to
press
her
to
the
earth
.
*NL*
Clifford
appeared
the
stronger
of
the
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
our
own
little
Phoebe
!
--
Ah
!
and
Holgrave
with
,
her
''
exclaimed
*NL*
he
,
with
a
glance
of
keen
and
delicate
insight
,
and
a
smile
,
beautiful
,
*NL*
kind
,
but
melancholy
.
``
I
thought
of
you
both
,
as
we
came
down
the
*NL*
street
,
and
beheld
Alice
's
Posies
in
full
bloom
.
And
so
the
flower
of
*NL*
Eden
has
bloomed
,
likewise
,
in
this
old
,
darksome
house
to-day
.

XXI
The
Departure
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
sudden
death
of
so
prominent
a
member
of
the
social
world
as
the
*NL*
Honorable
Judge
Jaffrey
Pyncheon
created
a
sensation
-LRB-
at
least
,
in
the
*NL*
circles
more
immediately
connected
with
the
deceased
-RRB-
which
had
hardly
*NL*
quite
subsided
in
a
fortnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
remarked
,
however
,
that
,
of
all
the
events
which
constitute
a
*NL*
person
's
biography
,
there
is
scarcely
one
--
none
,
certainly
,
of
anything
*NL*
like
a
similar
importance
--
to
which
the
world
so
easily
reconciles
*NL*
itself
as
to
his
death
.
In
most
other
cases
and
contingencies
,
the
*NL*
individual
is
present
among
us
,
mixed
up
with
the
daily
revolution
of
*NL*
affairs
,
and
affording
a
definite
point
for
observation
.
At
his
*NL*
decease
,
there
is
only
a
vacancy
,
and
a
momentary
eddy
,
--
very
small
,
as
*NL*
compared
with
the
apparent
magnitude
of
the
ingurgitated
object
,
--
and
a
*NL*
bubble
or
two
,
ascending
out
of
the
black
depth
and
bursting
at
the
*NL*
surface
.
As
regarded
Judge
Pyncheon
,
it
seemed
probable
,
at
first
*NL*
blush
,
that
the
mode
of
his
final
departure
might
give
him
a
larger
and
*NL*
longer
posthumous
vogue
than
ordinarily
attends
the
memory
of
a
*NL*
distinguished
man
.
But
when
it
came
to
be
understood
,
on
the
highest
*NL*
professional
authority
,
that
the
event
was
a
natural
,
and
--
except
for
*NL*
some
unimportant
particulars
,
denoting
a
slight
idiosyncrasy
--
by
no
*NL*
means
an
unusual
form
of
death
,
the
public
,
with
its
customary
*NL*
alacrity
,
proceeded
to
forget
that
he
had
ever
lived
.
In
short
,
the
*NL*
honorable
Judge
was
beginning
to
be
a
stale
subject
before
half
the
*NL*
country
newspapers
had
found
time
to
put
their
columns
in
mourning
,
and
*NL*
publish
his
exceedingly
eulogistic
obituary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
creeping
darkly
through
the
places
which
this
excellent
*NL*
person
had
haunted
in
his
lifetime
,
there
was
a
hidden
stream
of
*NL*
private
talk
,
such
as
it
would
have
shocked
all
decency
to
speak
loudly
*NL*
at
the
street-corners
.
It
is
very
singular
,
how
the
fact
of
a
man
's
*NL*
death
often
seems
to
give
people
a
truer
idea
of
his
character
,
whether
*NL*
for
good
or
evil
,
than
they
have
ever
possessed
while
he
was
living
and
*NL*
acting
among
them
.
Death
is
so
genuine
a
fact
that
it
excludes
*NL*
falsehood
,
or
betrays
its
emptiness
;
it
is
a
touchstone
that
proves
the
*NL*
gold
,
and
dishonors
the
baser
metal
.
Could
the
departed
,
whoever
he
*NL*
may
be
,
return
in
a
week
after
his
decease
,
he
would
almost
invariably
*NL*
find
himself
at
a
higher
or
lower
point
than
he
had
formerly
occupied
,
*NL*
on
the
scale
of
public
appreciation
.
But
the
talk
,
or
scandal
,
to
*NL*
which
we
now
allude
,
had
reference
to
matters
of
no
less
old
a
date
*NL*
than
the
supposed
murder
,
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
,
of
the
late
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
uncle
.
The
medical
opinion
with
regard
to
his
own
recent
*NL*
and
regretted
decease
had
almost
entirely
obviated
the
idea
that
a
*NL*
murder
was
committed
in
the
former
case
.
Yet
,
as
the
record
showed
,
*NL*
there
were
circumstances
irrefragably
indicating
that
some
person
had
*NL*
gained
access
to
old
Jaffrey
Pyncheon
's
private
apartments
,
at
or
near
*NL*
the
moment
of
his
death
.
His
desk
and
private
drawers
,
in
a
room
*NL*
contiguous
to
his
bedchamber
,
had
been
ransacked
;
money
and
valuable
*NL*
articles
were
missing
;
there
was
a
bloody
hand-print
on
the
old
man
's
*NL*
linen
;
and
,
by
a
powerfully
welded
chain
of
deductive
evidence
,
the
*NL*
guilt
of
the
robbery
and
apparent
murder
had
been
fixed
on
Clifford
,
*NL*
then
residing
with
his
uncle
in
the
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whencesoever
originating
,
there
now
arose
a
theory
that
undertook
so
to
*NL*
account
for
these
circumstances
as
to
exclude
the
idea
of
Clifford
's
*NL*
agency
.
Many
persons
affirmed
that
the
history
and
elucidation
of
the
*NL*
facts
,
long
so
mysterious
,
had
been
obtained
by
the
daguerreotypist
*NL*
from
one
of
those
mesmerical
seers
who
,
nowadays
,
so
strangely
perplex
*NL*
the
aspect
of
human
affairs
,
and
put
everybody
's
natural
vision
to
the
*NL*
blush
,
by
the
marvels
which
they
see
with
their
eyes
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
this
version
of
the
story
,
Judge
Pyncheon
,
exemplary
as
we
*NL*
have
portrayed
him
in
our
narrative
,
was
,
in
his
youth
,
an
apparently
*NL*
irreclaimable
scapegrace
.
The
brutish
,
the
animal
instincts
,
as
is
*NL*
often
the
case
,
had
been
developed
earlier
than
the
intellectual
*NL*
qualities
,
and
the
force
of
character
,
for
which
he
was
afterwards
*NL*
remarkable
.
He
had
shown
himself
wild
,
dissipated
,
addicted
to
low
*NL*
pleasures
,
little
short
of
ruffianly
in
his
propensities
,
and
*NL*
recklessly
expensive
,
with
no
other
resources
than
the
bounty
of
his
*NL*
uncle
.
This
course
of
conduct
had
alienated
the
old
bachelor
's
*NL*
affection
,
once
strongly
fixed
upon
him
.
Now
it
is
averred
,
--
but
*NL*
whether
on
authority
available
in
a
court
of
justice
,
we
do
not
pretend
*NL*
to
have
investigated
,
--
that
the
young
man
was
tempted
by
the
devil
,
one
*NL*
night
,
to
search
his
uncle
's
private
drawers
,
to
which
he
had
*NL*
unsuspected
means
of
access
.
While
thus
criminally
occupied
,
he
was
*NL*
startled
by
the
opening
of
the
chamber-door
.
There
stood
old
Jaffrey
*NL*
Pyncheon
,
in
his
nightclothes
!
The
surprise
of
such
a
discovery
,
his
*NL*
agitation
,
alarm
,
and
horror
,
brought
on
the
crisis
of
a
disorder
to
*NL*
which
the
old
bachelor
had
an
hereditary
liability
;
he
seemed
to
choke
*NL*
with
blood
,
and
fell
upon
the
floor
,
striking
his
temple
a
heavy
blow
*NL*
against
the
corner
of
a
table
.
What
was
to
be
done
?
The
old
man
was
*NL*
surely
dead
!
Assistance
would
come
too
late
!
What
a
misfortune
,
indeed
,
*NL*
should
it
come
too
soon
,
since
his
reviving
consciousness
would
bring
*NL*
the
recollection
of
the
ignominious
offence
which
he
had
beheld
his
*NL*
nephew
in
the
very
act
of
committing
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
never
did
revive
.
With
the
cool
hardihood
that
always
pertained
*NL*
to
him
,
the
young
man
continued
his
search
of
the
drawers
,
and
found
a
*NL*
will
,
of
recent
date
,
in
favor
of
Clifford
,
--
which
he
destroyed
,
--
and
*NL*
an
older
one
,
in
his
own
favor
,
which
he
suffered
to
remain
.
But
*NL*
before
retiring
,
Jaffrey
bethought
himself
of
the
evidence
,
in
these
*NL*
ransacked
drawers
,
that
some
one
had
visited
the
chamber
with
sinister
*NL*
purposes
.
Suspicion
,
unless
averted
,
might
fix
upon
the
real
offender
.
*NL*
In
the
very
presence
of
the
dead
man
,
therefore
,
he
laid
a
scheme
that
*NL*
should
free
himself
at
the
expense
of
Clifford
,
his
rival
,
for
whose
*NL*
character
he
had
at
once
a
contempt
and
a
repugnance
.
It
is
not
*NL*
probable
,
be
it
said
,
that
he
acted
with
any
set
purpose
of
involving
*NL*
Clifford
in
a
charge
of
murder
.
Knowing
that
his
uncle
did
not
die
by
*NL*
violence
,
it
may
not
have
occurred
to
him
,
in
the
hurry
of
the
crisis
,
*NL*
that
such
an
inference
might
be
drawn
.
But
,
when
the
affair
took
this
*NL*
darker
aspect
,
Jaffrey
's
previous
steps
had
already
pledged
him
to
*NL*
those
which
remained
.
So
craftily
had
he
arranged
the
circumstances
,
*NL*
that
,
at
Clifford
's
trial
,
his
cousin
hardly
found
it
necessary
to
*NL*
swear
to
anything
false
,
but
only
to
withhold
the
one
decisive
*NL*
explanation
,
by
refraining
to
state
what
he
had
himself
done
and
*NL*
witnessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Jaffrey
Pyncheon
's
inward
criminality
,
as
regarded
Clifford
,
was
,
*NL*
indeed
,
black
and
damnable
;
while
its
mere
outward
show
and
positive
*NL*
commission
was
the
smallest
that
could
possibly
consist
with
so
great
a
*NL*
sin
.
This
is
just
the
sort
of
guilt
that
a
man
of
eminent
*NL*
respectability
finds
it
easiest
to
dispose
of
.
It
was
suffered
to
fade
*NL*
out
of
sight
or
be
reckoned
a
venial
matter
,
in
the
Honorable
Judge
*NL*
Pyncheon
's
long
subsequent
survey
of
his
own
life
.
He
shuffled
it
*NL*
aside
,
among
the
forgotten
and
forgiven
frailties
of
his
youth
,
and
*NL*
seldom
thought
of
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
leave
the
Judge
to
his
repose
.
He
could
not
be
styled
fortunate
at
*NL*
the
hour
of
death
.
Unknowingly
,
he
was
a
childless
man
,
while
striving
*NL*
to
add
more
wealth
to
his
only
child
's
inheritance
.
Hardly
a
week
*NL*
after
his
decease
,
one
of
the
Cunard
steamers
brought
intelligence
of
*NL*
the
death
,
by
cholera
,
of
Judge
Pyncheon
's
son
,
just
at
the
point
of
*NL*
embarkation
for
his
native
land
.
By
this
misfortune
Clifford
became
*NL*
rich
;
so
did
Hepzibah
;
so
did
our
little
village
maiden
,
and
,
through
*NL*
her
,
that
sworn
foe
of
wealth
and
all
manner
of
conservatism
,
--
the
wild
*NL*
reformer
,
--
Holgrave
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
far
too
late
in
Clifford
's
life
for
the
good
opinion
of
*NL*
society
to
be
worth
the
trouble
and
anguish
of
a
formal
vindication
.
*NL*
What
he
needed
was
the
love
of
a
very
few
;
not
the
admiration
,
or
even
*NL*
the
respect
,
of
the
unknown
many
.
The
latter
might
probably
have
been
*NL*
won
for
him
,
had
those
on
whom
the
guardianship
of
his
welfare
had
*NL*
fallen
deemed
it
advisable
to
expose
Clifford
to
a
miserable
*NL*
resuscitation
of
past
ideas
,
when
the
condition
of
whatever
comfort
he
*NL*
might
expect
lay
in
the
calm
of
forgetfulness
.
After
such
wrong
as
he
*NL*
had
suffered
,
there
is
no
reparation
.
The
pitiable
mockery
of
it
,
*NL*
which
the
world
might
have
been
ready
enough
to
offer
,
coming
so
long
*NL*
after
the
agony
had
done
its
utmost
work
,
would
have
been
fit
only
to
*NL*
provoke
bitterer
laughter
than
poor
Clifford
was
ever
capable
of
.
It
*NL*
is
a
truth
-LRB-
and
it
would
be
a
very
sad
one
but
for
the
higher
hopes
*NL*
which
it
suggests
-RRB-
that
no
great
mistake
,
whether
acted
or
endured
,
in
*NL*
our
mortal
sphere
,
is
ever
really
set
right
.
Time
,
the
continual
*NL*
vicissitude
of
circumstances
,
and
the
invariable
inopportunity
of
*NL*
death
,
render
it
impossible
.
If
,
after
long
lapse
of
years
,
the
right
*NL*
seems
to
be
in
our
power
,
we
find
no
niche
to
set
it
in
.
The
better
*NL*
remedy
is
for
the
sufferer
to
pass
on
,
and
leave
what
he
once
thought
*NL*
his
irreparable
ruin
far
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shock
of
Judge
Pyncheon
's
death
had
a
permanently
invigorating
and
*NL*
ultimately
beneficial
effect
on
Clifford
.
That
strong
and
ponderous
*NL*
man
had
been
Clifford
's
nightmare
.
There
was
no
free
breath
to
be
*NL*
drawn
,
within
the
sphere
of
so
malevolent
an
influence
.
The
first
*NL*
effect
of
freedom
,
as
we
have
witnessed
in
Clifford
's
aimless
flight
,
*NL*
was
a
tremulous
exhilaration
.
Subsiding
from
it
,
he
did
not
sink
into
*NL*
his
former
intellectual
apathy
.
He
never
,
it
is
true
,
attained
to
*NL*
nearly
the
full
measure
of
what
might
have
been
his
faculties
.
But
he
*NL*
recovered
enough
of
them
partially
to
light
up
his
character
,
to
*NL*
display
some
outline
of
the
marvellous
grace
that
was
abortive
in
it
,
*NL*
and
to
make
him
the
object
of
no
less
deep
,
although
less
melancholy
*NL*
interest
than
heretofore
.
He
was
evidently
happy
.
Could
we
pause
to
*NL*
give
another
picture
of
his
daily
life
,
with
all
the
appliances
now
at
*NL*
command
to
gratify
his
instinct
for
the
Beautiful
,
the
garden
scenes
,
*NL*
that
seemed
so
sweet
to
him
,
would
look
mean
and
trivial
in
comparison
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
soon
after
their
change
of
fortune
,
Clifford
,
Hepzibah
,
and
little
*NL*
Phoebe
,
with
the
approval
of
the
artist
,
concluded
to
remove
from
the
*NL*
dismal
old
House
of
the
Seven
Gables
,
and
take
up
their
abode
,
for
the
*NL*
present
,
at
the
elegant
country-seat
of
the
late
Judge
Pyncheon
.
*NL*
Chanticleer
and
his
family
had
already
been
transported
thither
,
where
*NL*
the
two
hens
had
forthwith
begun
an
indefatigable
process
of
*NL*
egg-laying
,
with
an
evident
design
,
as
a
matter
of
duty
and
conscience
,
*NL*
to
continue
their
illustrious
breed
under
better
auspices
than
for
a
*NL*
century
past
.
On
the
day
set
for
their
departure
,
the
principal
*NL*
personages
of
our
story
,
including
good
Uncle
Venner
,
were
assembled
in
*NL*
the
parlor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
country-house
is
certainly
a
very
fine
one
,
so
far
as
the
plan
*NL*
goes
,
''
observed
Holgrave
,
as
the
party
were
discussing
their
future
*NL*
arrangements
.
``
But
I
wonder
that
the
late
Judge
--
being
so
opulent
,
and
*NL*
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
transmitting
his
wealth
to
descendants
of
*NL*
his
own
--
should
not
have
felt
the
propriety
of
embodying
so
excellent
a
*NL*
piece
of
domestic
architecture
in
stone
,
rather
than
in
wood
.
Then
,
*NL*
every
generation
of
the
family
might
have
altered
the
interior
,
to
suit
*NL*
its
own
taste
and
convenience
;
while
the
exterior
,
through
the
lapse
of
*NL*
years
,
might
have
been
adding
venerableness
to
its
original
beauty
,
and
*NL*
thus
giving
that
impression
of
permanence
which
I
consider
essential
to
*NL*
the
happiness
of
any
one
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
cried
Phoebe
,
gazing
into
the
artist
's
face
with
infinite
*NL*
amazement
,
``
how
wonderfully
your
ideas
are
changed
!
A
house
of
stone
,
*NL*
indeed
!
It
is
but
two
or
three
weeks
ago
that
you
seemed
to
wish
people
*NL*
to
live
in
something
as
fragile
and
temporary
as
a
bird
's
-
nest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Phoebe
,
I
told
you
how
it
would
be
!
''
said
the
artist
,
with
a
*NL*
half-melancholy
laugh
.
``
You
find
me
a
conservative
already
!
Little
*NL*
did
I
think
ever
to
become
one
.
It
is
especially
unpardonable
in
this
*NL*
dwelling
of
so
much
hereditary
misfortune
,
and
under
the
eye
of
yonder
*NL*
portrait
of
a
model
conservative
,
who
,
in
that
very
character
,
rendered
*NL*
himself
so
long
the
evil
destiny
of
his
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
picture
!
''
said
Clifford
,
seeming
to
shrink
from
its
stern
glance
.
*NL*
``
Whenever
I
look
at
it
,
there
is
an
old
dreamy
recollection
haunting
*NL*
me
,
but
keeping
just
beyond
the
grasp
of
my
mind
.
Wealth
,
it
seems
to
*NL*
say
!
--
boundless
wealth
!
--
unimaginable
wealth
!
I
could
fancy
that
,
when
*NL*
I
was
a
child
,
or
a
youth
,
that
portrait
had
spoken
,
and
told
me
a
rich
*NL*
secret
,
or
had
held
forth
its
hand
,
with
the
written
record
of
hidden
*NL*
opulence
.
But
those
old
matters
are
so
dim
with
me
,
nowadays
!
What
*NL*
could
this
dream
have
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
can
recall
it
,
''
answered
Holgrave
.
``
See
!
There
are
a
*NL*
hundred
chances
to
one
that
no
person
,
unacquainted
with
the
secret
,
*NL*
would
ever
touch
this
spring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
secret
spring
!
''
cried
Clifford
.
``
Ah
,
I
remember
now
!
I
did
discover
*NL*
it
,
one
summer
afternoon
,
when
I
was
idling
and
dreaming
about
the
*NL*
house
,
long
,
long
ago
.
But
the
mystery
escapes
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
artist
put
his
finger
on
the
contrivance
to
which
he
had
referred
.
*NL*
In
former
days
,
the
effect
would
probably
have
been
to
cause
the
*NL*
picture
to
start
forward
.
But
,
in
so
long
a
period
of
concealment
,
the
*NL*
machinery
had
been
eaten
through
with
rust
;
so
that
at
Holgrave
's
*NL*
pressure
,
the
portrait
,
frame
and
all
,
tumbled
suddenly
from
its
*NL*
position
,
and
lay
face
downward
on
the
floor
.
A
recess
in
the
wall
was
*NL*
thus
brought
to
light
,
in
which
lay
an
object
so
covered
with
a
*NL*
century
's
dust
that
it
could
not
immediately
be
recognized
as
a
folded
*NL*
sheet
of
parchment
.
Holgrave
opened
it
,
and
displayed
an
ancient
deed
,
*NL*
signed
with
the
hieroglyphics
of
several
Indian
sagamores
,
and
*NL*
conveying
to
Colonel
Pyncheon
and
his
heirs
,
forever
,
a
vast
extent
of
*NL*
territory
at
the
Eastward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
very
parchment
,
the
attempt
to
recover
which
cost
the
*NL*
beautiful
Alice
Pyncheon
her
happiness
and
life
,
''
said
the
artist
,
*NL*
alluding
to
his
legend
.
``
It
is
what
the
Pyncheons
sought
in
vain
,
*NL*
while
it
was
valuable
;
and
now
that
they
find
the
treasure
,
it
has
long
*NL*
been
worthless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Cousin
Jaffrey
!
This
is
what
deceived
him
,
''
exclaimed
Hepzibah
.
*NL*
``
When
they
were
young
together
,
Clifford
probably
made
a
kind
of
*NL*
fairy-tale
of
this
discovery
.
He
was
always
dreaming
hither
and
*NL*
thither
about
the
house
,
and
lighting
up
its
dark
corners
with
*NL*
beautiful
stories
.
And
poor
Jaffrey
,
who
took
hold
of
everything
as
if
*NL*
it
were
real
,
thought
my
brother
had
found
out
his
uncle
's
wealth
.
He
*NL*
died
with
this
delusion
in
his
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Phoebe
,
apart
to
Holgrave
,
``
how
came
you
to
know
the
*NL*
secret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
Phoebe
,
''
said
Holgrave
,
``
how
will
it
please
you
to
assume
*NL*
the
name
of
Maule
?
As
for
the
secret
,
it
is
the
only
inheritance
that
*NL*
has
come
down
to
me
from
my
ancestors
.
You
should
have
known
sooner
*NL*
-LRB-
only
that
I
was
afraid
of
frightening
you
away
-RRB-
that
,
in
this
long
*NL*
drama
of
wrong
and
retribution
,
I
represent
the
old
wizard
,
and
am
*NL*
probably
as
much
a
wizard
as
ever
he
was
.
The
son
of
the
executed
*NL*
Matthew
Maule
,
while
building
this
house
,
took
the
opportunity
to
*NL*
construct
that
recess
,
and
hide
away
the
Indian
deed
,
on
which
depended
*NL*
the
immense
land-claim
of
the
Pyncheons
.
Thus
they
bartered
their
*NL*
eastern
territory
for
Maule
's
garden-ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
''
said
Uncle
Venner
``
I
suppose
their
whole
claim
is
not
worth
*NL*
one
man
's
share
in
my
farm
yonder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
Venner
,
''
cried
Phoebe
,
taking
the
patched
philosopher
's
hand
,
*NL*
``
you
must
never
talk
any
more
about
your
farm
!
You
shall
never
go
*NL*
there
,
as
long
as
you
live
!
There
is
a
cottage
in
our
new
garden
,
--
the
*NL*
prettiest
little
yellowish-brown
cottage
you
ever
saw
;
and
the
*NL*
sweetest-looking
place
,
for
it
looks
just
as
if
it
were
made
of
*NL*
gingerbread
,
--
and
we
are
going
to
fit
it
up
and
furnish
it
,
on
purpose
*NL*
for
you
.
And
you
shall
do
nothing
but
what
you
choose
,
and
shall
be
as
*NL*
happy
as
the
day
is
long
,
and
shall
keep
Cousin
Clifford
in
spirits
*NL*
with
the
wisdom

pleasantness
which
is
always
dropping
from
your
*NL*
lips
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
my
dear
child
,
''
quoth
good
Uncle
Venner
,
quite
overcome
,
``
if
you
*NL*
were
to
speak
to
a
young
man
as
you
do
to
an
old
one
,
his
chance
of
*NL*
keeping
his
heart
another
minute
would
not
be
worth
one
of
the
buttons
*NL*
on
my
waistcoat
!
And
--
soul
alive
!
--
that
great
sigh
,
which
you
made
me
*NL*
heave
,
has
burst
off
the
very
last
of
them
!
But
,
never
mind
!
It
was
the
*NL*
happiest
sigh
I
ever
did
heave
;
and
it
seems
as
if
I
must
have
drawn
in
*NL*
a
gulp
of
heavenly
breath
,
to
make
it
with
.
Well
,
well
,
Miss
Phoebe
!
*NL*
They
'll
miss
me
in
the
gardens
hereabouts

round
by
the
back
doors
;
*NL*
and
Pyncheon
Street
,
I
'm
afraid
,
will
hardly
look
the
same
without
old
*NL*
Uncle
Venner
,
who
remembers
it
with
a
mowing
field
on
one
side
,
and
the
*NL*
garden
of
the
Seven
Gables
on
the
other
.
But
either
I
must
go
to
your
*NL*
country-seat
,
or
you
must
come
to
my
farm
,
--
that
's
one
of
two
things
*NL*
certain
;

I
leave
you
to
choose
which
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
with
us
,
by
all
means
,
Uncle
Venner

said
Clifford
,
who
had
*NL*
a
remarkable
enjoyment
of
the
old
man
's
mellow
,
quiet
,
and
simple
*NL*
spirit
.
``
I
want
you
always
to
be
within
five
minutes
,
saunter
of
my
*NL*
chair
.
You
are
the
only
philosopher
I
ever
knew
of
whose
wisdom
has
*NL*
not
a
drop
of
bitter
essence
at
the
bottom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
cried
Uncle
Venner
,
beginning
partly
to
realize
what
manner
*NL*
of
man
he
was
.
``
And
yet
folks
used
to
set
me
down
among
the
simple
*NL*
ones

in
my
younger
days

But
I
suppose
I
am
like
a
Roxbury
russet
,
--
a
*NL*
great
deal
the
better
,
the
longer
I
can
be
kept
.
Yes
;
and
my
words
of
*NL*
wisdom
,
that
you
and
Phoebe
tell
me
of
,
are
like
the
golden
dandelions
,
*NL*
which
never
grow
in
the
hot
months
,
but
may
be
seen
glistening
among
*NL*
the
withered
grass
,
and
under
the
dry
leaves
,
sometimes
as
late
as
*NL*
December
.
And
you
are
welcome
,
friends
,
to
my
mess
of
dandelions
,
if
*NL*
there
were
twice
as
many

*NL*
*NL*
A
plain
,
but
handsome
,
dark-green
barouche
had
now
drawn
up
in
front
of
*NL*
the
ruinous
portal
of
the
old
mansion-house
.
The
party
came
forth
,
and
*NL*
-LRB-
with
the
exception
of
good
Uncle
Venner
,
who
was
to
follow
in
a
few
*NL*
days
-RRB-
proceeded
to
take
their
places
.
They
were
chatting
and
laughing
*NL*
very
pleasantly
together
;
and
--
as
proves
to
be
often
the
case
,
at
*NL*
moments
when
we
ought
to
palpitate
with
sensibility
--
Clifford
and
*NL*
Hepzibah
bade
a
final
farewell
to
the
abode
of
their
forefathers
,
with
*NL*
hardly
more
emotion
than
if
they
had
made
it
their
arrangement
to
*NL*
return
thither
at
tea-time
.
Several
children
were
drawn
to
the
spot
by
*NL*
so
unusual
a
spectacle
as
the
barouche
and
pair
of
gray
horses
.
*NL*
Recognizing
little
Ned
Higgins
among
them
,
Hepzibah
put
her
hand
into
*NL*
her
pocket
,
and
presented
the
urchin
,
her
earliest
and
staunchest
*NL*
customer
,
with
silver
enough
to
people
the
Domdaniel
cavern
of
his
*NL*
interior
with
as
various
a
procession
of
quadrupeds
as
passed
into
the
*NL*
ark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
men
were
passing
,
just
as
the
barouche
drove
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Dixey
,
''
said
one
of
them
,
``
what
do
you
think
of
this
?
My
wife
*NL*
kept
a
cent-shop
three
months
,
and
lost
five
dollars
on
her
outlay
.
*NL*
Old
Maid
Pyncheon
has
been
in
trade
just
about
as
long
,
and
rides
off
*NL*
in
her
carriage
with
a
couple
of
hundred
thousand
,
--
reckoning
her
*NL*
share
,
and
Clifford
's
,
and
Phoebe
's
,
--
and
some
say
twice
as
much
!
If
*NL*
you
choose
to
call
it
luck
,
it
is
all
very
well
;
but
if
we
are
to
take
*NL*
it
as
the
will
of
Providence
,
why
,
I
ca
n't
exactly
fathom
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
good
business

the
sagacious
Dixey
,

``
pretty
good

business

*NL*
*NL*
Maule
's
well
,
all
this
time
,
though
left
in
solitude
,
was
throwing
up
a
*NL*
succession
of
kaleidoscopic
pictures
,
in
which
a
gifted
eye
might
have
*NL*
seen
foreshadowed
the
coming
fortunes
of
Hepzibah
and
Clifford
,
and
the
*NL*
descendant
of
the
legendary
wizard
,
and
the
village
maiden
,
over
whom
*NL*
he
had
thrown
love
's
web
of
sorcery
.
The
Pyncheon
Elm
,
moreover
,
with
*NL*
what
foliage
the
September
gale
had
spared
to
it
,
whispered
*NL*
unintelligible
prophecies
.
And
wise
Uncle
Venner
,
passing
slowly
from
*NL*
the
ruinous
porch
,
seemed
to
hear
a
strain
of
music
,
and
fancied
that
*NL*
sweet
Alice
Pyncheon
--
after
witnessing
these
deeds
,
this
bygone
woe
and
*NL*
this
present
happiness
,
of
her
kindred
mortals
--
had
given
one
farewell
*NL*
touch
of
a
spirit
's
joy
upon
her
harpsichord
,
as
she
floated
heavenward
*NL*
from
the

OF
THE
SEVEN
