PART

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
days
when
the
spinning-wheels
hummed
busily
in
the
*NL*
farmhouses
--
and
even
great
ladies
,
clothed
in
silk
and
thread-lace
,
had
*NL*
their
toy
spinning-wheels
of
polished
oak
--
there
might
be
seen
in
*NL*
districts
far
away
among
the
lanes
,
or
deep
in
the
bosom
of
the
hills
,
*NL*
certain
pallid
undersized
men
,
who
,
by
the
side
of
the
brawny
*NL*
country-folk
,
looked
like
the
remnants
of
a
disinherited
race
.
The
*NL*
shepherd
's
dog
barked
fiercely
when
one
of
these
alien-looking
men
*NL*
appeared
on
the
upland
,
dark
against
the
early
winter
sunset
;
for
what
*NL*
dog
likes
a
figure
bent
under
a
heavy
bag
?
--
and
these
pale
men
rarely
*NL*
stirred
abroad
without
that
mysterious
burden
.
The
shepherd
himself
,
*NL*
though
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
bag
held
nothing
but
*NL*
flaxen
thread
,
or
else
the
long
rolls
of
strong
linen
spun
from
that
*NL*
thread
,
was
not
quite
sure
that
this
trade
of
weaving
,
indispensable
*NL*
though
it
was
,
could
be
carried
on
entirely
without
the
help
of
the
*NL*
Evil
One
.
In
that
far-off
time
superstition
clung
easily
round
every
*NL*
person
or
thing
that
was
at
all
unwonted
,
or
even
intermittent
and
*NL*
occasional
merely
,
like
the
visits
of
the
pedlar
or
the
knife-grinder
.
*NL*
No
one
knew
where
wandering
men
had
their
homes
or
their
origin
;
and
*NL*
how
was
a
man
to
be
explained
unless
you
at
least
knew
somebody
who
*NL*
knew
his
father
and
mother
?
To
the
peasants
of
old
times
,
the
world
*NL*
outside
their
own
direct
experience
was
a
region
of
vagueness
and
*NL*
mystery
:
to
their
untravelled
thought
a
state
of
wandering
was
a
*NL*
conception
as
dim
as
the
winter
life
of
the
swallows
that
came
back
*NL*
with
the
spring
;
and
even
a
settler
,
if
he
came
from
distant
parts
,
*NL*
hardly
ever
ceased
to
be
viewed
with
a
remnant
of
distrust
,
which
would
*NL*
have
prevented
any
surprise
if
a
long
course
of
inoffensive
conduct
on
*NL*
his
part
had
ended
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
;
especially
if
he
had
*NL*
any
reputation
for
knowledge
,
or
showed
any
skill
in
handicraft
.
All
*NL*
cleverness
,
whether
in
the
rapid
use
of
that
difficult
instrument
the
*NL*
tongue
,
or
in
some
other
art
unfamiliar
to
villagers
,
was
in
itself
*NL*
suspicious
:
honest
folk
,
born
and
bred
in
a
visible
manner
,
were
mostly
*NL*
not
overwise
or
clever
--
at
least
,
not
beyond
such
a
matter
as
knowing
*NL*
the
signs
of
the
weather
;
and
the
process
by
which
rapidity
and
*NL*
dexterity
of
any
kind
were
acquired
was
so
wholly
hidden
,
that
they
*NL*
partook
of
the
nature
of
conjuring
.
In
this
way
it
came
to
pass
that
*NL*
those
scattered
linen-weavers
--
emigrants
from
the
town
into
the
*NL*
country
--
were
to
the
last
regarded
as
aliens
by
their
rustic
*NL*
neighbours
,
and
usually
contracted
the
eccentric
habits
which
belong
to
*NL*
a
state
of
loneliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
early
years
of
this
century
,
such
a
linen-weaver
,
named
Silas
*NL*
Marner
,
worked
at
his
vocation
in
a
stone
cottage
that
stood
among
the
*NL*
nutty
hedgerows
near
the
village
of
Raveloe
,
and
not
far
from
the
edge
*NL*
of
a
deserted
stone-pit
.
The
questionable
sound
of
Silas
's
loom
,
so
*NL*
unlike
the
natural
cheerful
trotting
of
the
winnowing-machine
,
or
the
*NL*
simpler
rhythm
of
the
flail
,
had
a
half-fearful
fascination
for
the
*NL*
Raveloe
boys
,
who
would
often
leave
off
their
nutting
or
birds
'
-
nesting
*NL*
to
peep
in
at
the
window
of
the
stone
cottage
,
counterbalancing
a
*NL*
certain
awe
at
the
mysterious
action
of
the
loom
,
by
a
pleasant
sense
*NL*
of
scornful
superiority
,
drawn
from
the
mockery
of
its
alternating
*NL*
noises
,
along
with
the
bent
,
tread-mill
attitude
of
the
weaver
.
But
*NL*
sometimes
it
happened
that
Marner
,
pausing
to
adjust
an
irregularity
in
*NL*
his
thread
,
became
aware
of
the
small
scoundrels
,
and
,
though
chary
of
*NL*
his
time
,
he
liked
their
intrusion
so
ill
that
he
would
descend
from
*NL*
his
loom
,
and
,
opening
the
door
,
would
fix
on
them
a
gaze
that
was
*NL*
always
enough
to
make
them
take
to
their
legs
in
terror
.
For
how
was
*NL*
it
possible
to
believe
that
those
large
brown
protuberant
eyes
in
Silas
*NL*
Marner
's
pale
face
really
saw
nothing
very
distinctly
that
was
not
*NL*
close
to
them
,
and
not
rather
that
their
dreadful
stare
could
dart
*NL*
cramp
,
or
rickets
,
or
a
wry
mouth
at
any
boy
who
happened
to
be
in
the
*NL*
rear
?
They
had
,
perhaps
,
heard
their
fathers
and
mothers
hint
that
*NL*
Silas
Marner
could
cure
folks
'
rheumatism
if
he
had
a
mind
,
and
add
,
*NL*
still
more
darkly
,
that
if
you
could
only
speak
the
devil
fair
enough
,
*NL*
he
might
save
you
the
cost
of
the
doctor
.
Such
strange
lingering
*NL*
echoes
of
the
old
demon-worship
might
perhaps
even
now
be
caught
by
the
*NL*
diligent
listener
among
the
grey-haired
peasantry
;
for
the
rude
mind
*NL*
with
difficulty
associates
the
ideas
of
power
and
benignity
.
A
shadowy
*NL*
conception
of
power
that
by
much
persuasion
can
be
induced
to
refrain
*NL*
from
inflicting
harm
,
is
the
shape
most
easily
taken
by
the
sense
of
*NL*
the
Invisible
in
the
minds
of
men
who
have
always
been
pressed
close
by
*NL*
primitive
wants
,
and
to
whom
a
life
of
hard
toil
has
never
been
*NL*
illuminated
by
any
enthusiastic
religious
faith
.
To
them
pain
and
*NL*
mishap
present
a
far
wider
range
of
possibilities
than
gladness
and
*NL*
enjoyment
:
their
imagination
is
almost
barren
of
the
images
that
feed
*NL*
desire
and
hope
,
but
is
all
overgrown
by
recollections
that
are
a
*NL*
perpetual
pasture
to
fear
.
``
Is
there
anything
you
can
fancy
that
you
*NL*
would
like
to
eat
?
''
I
once
said
to
an
old
labouring
man
,
who
was
in
*NL*
his
last
illness
,
and
who
had
refused
all
the
food
his
wife
had
offered
*NL*
him
.
``
No
,
''
he
answered
,
``
I
've
never
been
used
to
nothing
but
common
*NL*
victual
,
and
I
ca
n't
eat
that
.
''
Experience
had
bred
no
fancies
in
him
*NL*
that
could
raise
the
phantasm
of
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Raveloe
was
a
village
where
many
of
the
old
echoes
lingered
,
*NL*
undrowned
by
new
voices
.
Not
that
it
was
one
of
those
barren
parishes
*NL*
lying
on
the
outskirts
of
civilization
--
inhabited
by
meagre
sheep
and
*NL*
thinly-scattered
shepherds
:
on
the
contrary
,
it
lay
in
the
rich
central
*NL*
plain
of
what
we
are
pleased
to
call
Merry
England
,
and
held
farms
*NL*
which
,
speaking
from
a
spiritual
point
of
view
,
paid
highly-desirable
*NL*
tithes
.
But
it
was
nestled
in
a
snug
well-wooded
hollow
,
quite
an
*NL*
hour
's
journey
on
horseback
from
any
turnpike
,
where
it
was
never
*NL*
reached
by
the
vibrations
of
the
coach-horn
,
or
of
public
opinion
.
It
*NL*
was
an
important-looking
village
,
with
a
fine
old
church
and
large
*NL*
churchyard
in
the
heart
of
it
,
and
two
or
three
large
brick-and-stone
*NL*
homesteads
,
with
well-walled
orchards
and
ornamental
weathercocks
,
*NL*
standing
close
upon
the
road
,
and
lifting
more
imposing
fronts
than
the
*NL*
rectory
,
which
peeped
from
among
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
churchyard
:
--
a
village
which
showed
at
once
the
summits
of
its
social
*NL*
life
,
and
told
the
practised
eye
that
there
was
no
great
park
and
*NL*
manor-house
in
the
vicinity
,
but
that
there
were
several
chiefs
in
*NL*
Raveloe
who
could
farm
badly
quite
at
their
ease
,
drawing
enough
money
*NL*
from
their
bad
farming
,
in
those
war
times
,
to
live
in
a
rollicking
*NL*
fashion
,
and
keep
a
jolly
Christmas
,
Whitsun
,
and
Easter
tide
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fifteen
years
since
Silas
Marner
had
first
come
to
Raveloe
;
he
*NL*
was
then
simply
a
pallid
young
man
,
with
prominent
short-sighted
brown
*NL*
eyes
,
whose
appearance
would
have
had
nothing
strange
for
people
of
*NL*
average
culture
and
experience
,
but
for
the
villagers
near
whom
he
had
*NL*
come
to
settle
it
had
mysterious
peculiarities
which
corresponded
with
*NL*
the
exceptional
nature
of
his
occupation
,
and
his
advent
from
an
*NL*
unknown
region
called
``
North
`
ard
''
.
So
had
his
way
of
life
:
--
he
invited
*NL*
no
comer
to
step
across
his
door-sill
,
and
he
never
strolled
into
the
*NL*
village
to
drink
a
pint
at
the
Rainbow
,
or
to
gossip
at
the
*NL*
wheelwright
's
:
he
sought
no
man
or
woman
,
save
for
the
purposes
of
his
*NL*
calling
,
or
in
order
to
supply
himself
with
necessaries
;
and
it
was
*NL*
soon
clear
to
the
Raveloe
lasses
that
he
would
never
urge
one
of
them
*NL*
to
accept
him
against
her
will
--
quite
as
if
he
had
heard
them
declare
*NL*
that
they
would
never
marry
a
dead
man
come
to
life
again
.
This
view
*NL*
of
Marner
's
personality
was
not
without
another
ground
than
his
pale
*NL*
face
and
unexampled
eyes
;
for
Jem
Rodney
,
the
mole-catcher
,
averred
*NL*
that
one
evening
as
he
was
returning
homeward
,
he
saw
Silas
Marner
*NL*
leaning
against
a
stile
with
a
heavy
bag
on
his
back
,
instead
of
*NL*
resting
the
bag
on
the
stile
as
a
man
in
his
senses
would
have
done
;
*NL*
and
that
,
on
coming
up
to
him
,
he
saw
that
Marner
's
eyes
were
set
like
*NL*
a
dead
man
's
,
and
he
spoke
to
him
,
and
shook
him
,
and
his
limbs
were
*NL*
stiff
,
and
his
hands
clutched
the
bag
as
if
they
'd
been
made
of
iron
;
*NL*
but
just
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
the
weaver
was
dead
,
he
came
*NL*
all
right
again
,
like
,
as
you
might
say
,
in
the
winking
of
an
eye
,
and
*NL*
said
``
Good-night
''
,
and
walked
off
.
All
this
Jem
swore
he
had
seen
,
*NL*
more
by
token
that
it
was
the
very
day
he
had
been
mole-catching
on
*NL*
Squire
Cass
's
land
,
down
by
the
old
saw-pit
.
Some
said
Marner
must
*NL*
have
been
in
a
``
fit
''
,
a
word
which
seemed
to
explain
things
otherwise
*NL*
incredible
;
but
the
argumentative
Mr.
Macey
,
clerk
of
the
parish
,
shook
*NL*
his
head
,
and
asked
if
anybody
was
ever
known
to
go
off
in
a
fit
and
*NL*
not
fall
down
.
A
fit
was
a
stroke
,
was
n't
it
?
and
it
was
in
the
*NL*
nature
of
a
stroke
to
partly
take
away
the
use
of
a
man
's
limbs
and
*NL*
throw
him
on
the
parish
,
if
he
'd
got
no
children
to
look
to
.
No
,
no
;
*NL*
it
was
no
stroke
that
would
let
a
man
stand
on
his
legs
,
like
a
horse
*NL*
between
the
shafts
,
and
then
walk
off
as
soon
as
you
can
say
``
Gee
!
''
*NL*
But
there
might
be
such
a
thing
as
a
man
's
soul
being
loose
from
his
*NL*
body
,
and
going
out
and
in
,
like
a
bird
out
of
its
nest
and
back
;
and
*NL*
that
was
how
folks
got
over-wise
,
for
they
went
to
school
in
this
*NL*
shell-less
state
to
those
who
could
teach
them
more
than
their
*NL*
neighbours
could
learn
with
their
five
senses
and
the
parson
.
And
*NL*
where
did
Master
Marner
get
his
knowledge
of
herbs
from
--
and
charms
*NL*
too
,
if
he
liked
to
give
them
away
?
Jem
Rodney
's
story
was
no
more
*NL*
than
what
might
have
been
expected
by
anybody
who
had
seen
how
Marner
*NL*
had
cured
Sally
Oates
,
and
made
her
sleep
like
a
baby
,
when
her
heart
*NL*
had
been
beating
enough
to
burst
her
body
,
for
two
months
and
more
,
*NL*
while
she
had
been
under
the
doctor
's
care
.
He
might
cure
more
folks
*NL*
if
he
would
;
but
he
was
worth
speaking
fair
,
if
it
was
only
to
keep
him
*NL*
from
doing
you
a
mischief
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
partly
to
this
vague
fear
that
Marner
was
indebted
for
*NL*
protecting
him
from
the
persecution
that
his
singularities
might
have
*NL*
drawn
upon
him
,
but
still
more
to
the
fact
that
,
the
old
linen-weaver
*NL*
in
the
neighbouring
parish
of
Tarley
being
dead
,
his
handicraft
made
*NL*
him
a
highly
welcome
settler
to
the
richer
housewives
of
the
district
,
*NL*
and
even
to
the
more
provident
cottagers
,
who
had
their
little
stock
of
*NL*
yarn
at
the
year
's
end
.
Their
sense
of
his
usefulness
would
have
*NL*
counteracted
any
repugnance
or
suspicion
which
was
not
confirmed
by
a
*NL*
deficiency
in
the
quality
or
the
tale
of
the
cloth
he
wove
for
them
.
*NL*
And
the
years
had
rolled
on
without
producing
any
change
in
the
*NL*
impressions
of
the
neighbours
concerning
Marner
,
except
the
change
from
*NL*
novelty
to
habit
.
At
the
end
of
fifteen
years
the
Raveloe
men
said
*NL*
just
the
same
things
about
Silas
Marner
as
at
the
beginning
:
they
did
*NL*
not
say
them
quite
so
often
,
but
they
believed
them
much
more
strongly
*NL*
when
they
did
say
them
.
There
was
only
one
important
addition
which
*NL*
the
years
had
brought
:
it
was
,
that
Master
Marner
had
laid
by
a
fine
*NL*
sight
of
money
somewhere
,
and
that
he
could
buy
up
``
bigger
men
''
than
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
opinion
concerning
him
had
remained
nearly
stationary
,
and
*NL*
his
daily
habits
had
presented
scarcely
any
visible
change
,
Marner
's
*NL*
inward
life
had
been
a
history
and
a
metamorphosis
,
as
that
of
every
*NL*
fervid
nature
must
be
when
it
has
fled
,
or
been
condemned
,
to
solitude
.
*NL*
His
life
,
before
he
came
to
Raveloe
,
had
been
filled
with
the
movement
,
*NL*
the
mental
activity
,
and
the
close
fellowship
,
which
,
in
that
day
as
in
*NL*
this
,
marked
the
life
of
an
artisan
early
incorporated
in
a
narrow
*NL*
religious
sect
,
where
the
poorest
layman
has
the
chance
of
*NL*
distinguishing
himself
by
gifts
of
speech
,
and
has
,
at
the
very
least
,
*NL*
the
weight
of
a
silent
voter
in
the
government
of
his
community
.
*NL*
Marner
was
highly
thought
of
in
that
little
hidden
world
,
known
to
*NL*
itself
as
the
church
assembling
in
Lantern
Yard
;
he
was
believed
to
be
*NL*
a
young
man
of
exemplary
life
and
ardent
faith
;
and
a
peculiar
interest
*NL*
had
been
centred
in
him
ever
since
he
had
fallen
,
at
a
prayer-meeting
,
*NL*
into
a
mysterious
rigidity
and
suspension
of
consciousness
,
which
,
*NL*
lasting
for
an
hour
or
more
,
had
been
mistaken
for
death
.
To
have
*NL*
sought
a
medical
explanation
for
this
phenomenon
would
have
been
held
*NL*
by
Silas
himself
,
as
well
as
by
his
minister
and
fellow-members
,
a
*NL*
wilful
self-exclusion
from
the
spiritual
significance
that
might
lie
*NL*
therein
.
Silas
was
evidently
a
brother
selected
for
a
peculiar
*NL*
discipline
;
and
though
the
effort
to
interpret
this
discipline
was
*NL*
discouraged
by
the
absence
,
on
his
part
,
of
any
spiritual
vision
during
*NL*
his
outward
trance
,
yet
it
was
believed
by
himself
and
others
that
its
*NL*
effect
was
seen
in
an
accession
of
light
and
fervour
.
A
less
truthful
*NL*
man
than
he
might
have
been
tempted
into
the
subsequent
creation
of
a
*NL*
vision
in
the
form
of
resurgent
memory
;
a
less
sane
man
might
have
*NL*
believed
in
such
a
creation
;
but
Silas
was
both
sane
and
honest
,
*NL*
though
,
as
with
many
honest
and
fervent
men
,
culture
had
not
defined
*NL*
any
channels
for
his
sense
of
mystery
,
and
so
it
spread
itself
over
the
*NL*
proper
pathway
of
inquiry
and
knowledge
.
He
had
inherited
from
his
*NL*
mother
some
acquaintance
with
medicinal
herbs
and
their
preparation
--
a
*NL*
little
store
of
wisdom
which
she
had
imparted
to
him
as
a
solemn
*NL*
bequest
--
but
of
late
years
he
had
had
doubts
about
the
lawfulness
of
*NL*
applying
this
knowledge
,
believing
that
herbs
could
have
no
efficacy
*NL*
without
prayer
,
and
that
prayer
might
suffice
without
herbs
;
so
that
*NL*
the
inherited
delight
he
had
in
wandering
in
the
fields
in
search
of
*NL*
foxglove
and
dandelion
and
coltsfoot
,
began
to
wear
to
him
the
*NL*
character
of
a
temptation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
members
of
his
church
there
was
one
young
man
,
a
little
older
*NL*
than
himself
,
with
whom
he
had
long
lived
in
such
close
friendship
that
*NL*
it
was
the
custom
of
their
Lantern
Yard
brethren
to
call
them
David
and
*NL*
Jonathan
.
The
real
name
of
the
friend
was
William
Dane
,
and
he
,
too
,
*NL*
was
regarded
as
a
shining
instance
of
youthful
piety
,
though
somewhat
*NL*
given
to
over-severity
towards
weaker
brethren
,
and
to
be
so
dazzled
by
*NL*
his
own
light
as
to
hold
himself
wiser
than
his
teachers
.
But
whatever
*NL*
blemishes
others
might
discern
in
William
,
to
his
friend
's
mind
he
was
*NL*
faultless
;
for
Marner
had
one
of
those
impressible
self-doubting
*NL*
natures
which
,
at
an
inexperienced
age
,
admire
imperativeness
and
lean
*NL*
on
contradiction
.
The
expression
of
trusting
simplicity
in
Marner
's
*NL*
face
,
heightened
by
that
absence
of
special
observation
,
that
*NL*
defenceless
,
deer-like
gaze
which
belongs
to
large
prominent
eyes
,
was
*NL*
strongly
contrasted
by
the
self-complacent
suppression
of
inward
*NL*
triumph
that
lurked
in
the
narrow
slanting
eyes
and
compressed
lips
of
*NL*
William
Dane
.
One
of
the
most
frequent
topics
of
conversation
between
*NL*
the
two
friends
was
Assurance
of
salvation
:
Silas
confessed
that
he
*NL*
could
never
arrive
at
anything
higher
than
hope
mingled
with
fear
,
and
*NL*
listened
with
longing
wonder
when
William
declared
that
he
had
*NL*
possessed
unshaken
assurance
ever
since
,
in
the
period
of
his
*NL*
conversion
,
he
had
dreamed
that
he
saw
the
words
``
calling
and
election
*NL*
sure
''
standing
by
themselves
on
a
white
page
in
the
open
Bible
.
Such
*NL*
colloquies
have
occupied
many
a
pair
of
pale-faced
weavers
,
whose
*NL*
unnurtured
souls
have
been
like
young
winged
things
,
fluttering
*NL*
forsaken
in
the
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
seemed
to
the
unsuspecting
Silas
that
the
friendship
had
*NL*
suffered
no
chill
even
from
his
formation
of
another
attachment
of
a
*NL*
closer
kind
.
For
some
months
he
had
been
engaged
to
a
young
*NL*
servant-woman
,
waiting
only
for
a
little
increase
to
their
mutual
*NL*
savings
in
order
to
their
marriage
;
and
it
was
a
great
delight
to
him
*NL*
that
Sarah
did
not
object
to
William
's
occasional
presence
in
their
*NL*
Sunday
interviews
.
It
was
at
this
point
in
their
history
that
Silas
's
*NL*
cataleptic
fit
occurred
during
the
prayer-meeting
;
and
amidst
the
*NL*
various
queries
and
expressions
of
interest
addressed
to
him
by
his
*NL*
fellow-members
,
William
's
suggestion
alone
jarred
with
the
general
*NL*
sympathy
towards
a
brother
thus
singled
out
for
special
dealings
.
He
*NL*
observed
that
,
to
him
,
this
trance
looked
more
like
a
visitation
of
*NL*
Satan
than
a
proof
of
divine
favour
,
and
exhorted
his
friend
to
see
*NL*
that
he
hid
no
accursed
thing
within
his
soul
.
Silas
,
feeling
bound
to
*NL*
accept
rebuke
and
admonition
as
a
brotherly
office
,
felt
no
resentment
,
*NL*
but
only
pain
,
at
his
friend
's
doubts
concerning
him
;
and
to
this
was
*NL*
soon
added
some
anxiety
at
the
perception
that
Sarah
's
manner
towards
*NL*
him
began
to
exhibit
a
strange
fluctuation
between
an
effort
at
an
*NL*
increased
manifestation
of
regard
and
involuntary
signs
of
shrinking
*NL*
and
dislike
.
He
asked
her
if
she
wished
to
break
off
their
engagement
;
*NL*
but
she
denied
this
:
their
engagement
was
known
to
the
church
,
and
had
*NL*
been
recognized
in
the
prayer-meetings
;
it
could
not
be
broken
off
*NL*
without
strict
investigation
,
and
Sarah
could
render
no
reason
that
*NL*
would
be
sanctioned
by
the
feeling
of
the
community
.
At
this
time
the
*NL*
senior
deacon
was
taken
dangerously
ill
,
and
,
being
a
childless
*NL*
widower
,
he
was
tended
night
and
day
by
some
of
the
younger
brethren
or
*NL*
sisters
.
Silas
frequently
took
his
turn
in
the
night-watching
with
*NL*
William
,
the
one
relieving
the
other
at
two
in
the
morning
.
The
old
*NL*
man
,
contrary
to
expectation
,
seemed
to
be
on
the
way
to
recovery
,
when
*NL*
one
night
Silas
,
sitting
up
by
his
bedside
,
observed
that
his
usual
*NL*
audible
breathing
had
ceased
.
The
candle
was
burning
low
,
and
he
had
*NL*
to
lift
it
to
see
the
patient
's
face
distinctly
.
Examination
convinced
*NL*
him
that
the
deacon
was
dead
--
had
been
dead
some
time
,
for
the
limbs
*NL*
were
rigid
.
Silas
asked
himself
if
he
had
been
asleep
,
and
looked
at
*NL*
the
clock
:
it
was
already
four
in
the
morning
.
How
was
it
that
William
*NL*
had
not
come
?
In
much
anxiety
he
went
to
seek
for
help
,
and
soon
there
*NL*
were
several
friends
assembled
in
the
house
,
the
minister
among
them
,
*NL*
while
Silas
went
away
to
his
work
,
wishing
he
could
have
met
William
to
*NL*
know
the
reason
of
his
non-appearance
.
But
at
six
o'clock
,
as
he
was
*NL*
thinking
of
going
to
seek
his
friend
,
William
came
,
and
with
him
the
*NL*
minister
.
They
came
to
summon
him
to
Lantern
Yard
,
to
meet
the
church
*NL*
members
there
;
and
to
his
inquiry
concerning
the
cause
of
the
summons
*NL*
the
only
reply
was
,
``
You
will
hear
.
''
Nothing
further
was
said
until
*NL*
Silas
was
seated
in
the
vestry
,
in
front
of
the
minister
,
with
the
eyes
*NL*
of
those
who
to
him
represented
God
's
people
fixed
solemnly
upon
him
.
*NL*
Then
the
minister
,
taking
out
a
pocket-knife
,
showed
it
to
Silas
,
and
*NL*
asked
him
if
he
knew
where
he
had
left
that
knife
?
Silas
said
,
he
did
*NL*
not
know
that
he
had
left
it
anywhere
out
of
his
own
pocket
--
but
he
was
*NL*
trembling
at
this
strange
interrogation
.
He
was
then
exhorted
not
to
*NL*
hide
his
sin
,
but
to
confess
and
repent
.
The
knife
had
been
found
in
*NL*
the
bureau
by
the
departed
deacon
's
bedside
--
found
in
the
place
where
*NL*
the
little
bag
of
church
money
had
lain
,
which
the
minister
himself
had
*NL*
seen
the
day
before
.
Some
hand
had
removed
that
bag
;
and
whose
hand
*NL*
could
it
be
,
if
not
that
of
the
man
to
whom
the
knife
belonged
?
For
*NL*
some
time
Silas
was
mute
with
astonishment
:
then
he
said
,
``
God
will
*NL*
clear
me
:
I
know
nothing
about
the
knife
being
there
,
or
the
money
*NL*
being
gone
.
Search
me
and
my
dwelling
;
you
will
find
nothing
but
three
*NL*
pound
five
of
my
own
savings
,
which
William
Dane
knows
I
have
had
these
*NL*
six
months
.
''
At
this
William
groaned
,
but
the
minister
said
,
``
The
*NL*
proof
is
heavy
against
you
,
brother
Marner
.
The
money
was
taken
in
the
*NL*
night
last
past
,
and
no
man
was
with
our
departed
brother
but
you
,
for
*NL*
William
Dane
declares
to
us
that
he
was
hindered
by
sudden
sickness
*NL*
from
going
to
take
his
place
as
usual
,
and
you
yourself
said
that
he
*NL*
had
not
come
;
and
,
moreover
,
you
neglected
the
dead
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
have
slept
,
''
said
Silas
.
Then
,
after
a
pause
,
he
added
,
``
Or
I
*NL*
must
have
had
another
visitation
like
that
which
you
have
all
seen
me
*NL*
under
,
so
that
the
thief
must
have
come
and
gone
while
I
was
not
in
the
*NL*
body
,
but
out
of
the
body
.
But
,
I
say
again
,
search
me
and
my
*NL*
dwelling
,
for
I
have
been
nowhere
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
search
was
made
,
and
it
ended
--
in
William
Dane
's
finding
the
*NL*
well-known
bag
,
empty
,
tucked
behind
the
chest
of
drawers
in
Silas
's
*NL*
chamber
!
On
this
William
exhorted
his
friend
to
confess
,
and
not
to
*NL*
hide
his
sin
any
longer
.
Silas
turned
a
look
of
keen
reproach
on
him
,
*NL*
and
said
,
``
William
,
for
nine
years
that
we
have
gone
in
and
out
*NL*
together
,
have
you
ever
known
me
tell
a
lie
?
But
God
will
clear
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
said
William
,
``
how
do
I
know
what
you
may
have
done
in
the
*NL*
secret
chambers
of
your
heart
,
to
give
Satan
an
advantage
over
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
was
still
looking
at
his
friend
.
Suddenly
a
deep
flush
came
over
*NL*
his
face
,
and
he
was
about
to
speak
impetuously
,
when
he
seemed
checked
*NL*
again
by
some
inward
shock
,
that
sent
the
flush
back
and
made
him
*NL*
tremble
.
But
at
last
he
spoke
feebly
,
looking
at
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
now
--
the
knife
was
n't
in
my
pocket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
William
said
,
``
I
know
nothing
of
what
you
mean
.
''
The
other
persons
*NL*
present
,
however
,
began
to
inquire
where
Silas
meant
to
say
that
the
*NL*
knife
was
,
but
he
would
give
no
further
explanation
:
he
only
said
,
``
I
*NL*
am
sore
stricken
;
I
can
say
nothing
.
God
will
clear
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
return
to
the
vestry
there
was
further
deliberation
.
Any
*NL*
resort
to
legal
measures
for
ascertaining
the
culprit
was
contrary
to
*NL*
the
principles
of
the
church
in
Lantern
Yard
,
according
to
which
*NL*
prosecution
was
forbidden
to
Christians
,
even
had
the
case
held
less
*NL*
scandal
to
the
community
.
But
the
members
were
bound
to
take
other
*NL*
measures
for
finding
out
the
truth
,
and
they
resolved
on
praying
and
*NL*
drawing
lots
.
This
resolution
can
be
a
ground
of
surprise
only
to
*NL*
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
that
obscure
religious
life
which
has
*NL*
gone
on
in
the
alleys
of
our
towns
.
Silas
knelt
with
his
brethren
,
*NL*
relying
on
his
own
innocence
being
certified
by
immediate
divine
*NL*
interference
,
but
feeling
that
there
was
sorrow
and
mourning
behind
for
*NL*
him
even
then
--
that
his
trust
in
man
had
been
cruelly
bruised
.
_
The
*NL*
lots
declared
that
Silas
Marner
was
guilty
.
_
He
was
solemnly
suspended
*NL*
from
church-membership
,
and
called
upon
to
render
up
the
stolen
money
:
*NL*
only
on
confession
,
as
the
sign
of
repentance
,
could
he
be
received
*NL*
once
more
within
the
folds
of
the
church
.
Marner
listened
in
silence
.
*NL*
At
last
,
when
everyone
rose
to
depart
,
he
went
towards
William
Dane
and
*NL*
said
,
in
a
voice
shaken
by
agitation
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
time
I
remember
using
my
knife
,
was
when
I
took
it
out
to
cut
*NL*
a
strap
for
you
.
I
do
n't
remember
putting
it
in
my
pocket
again
.
*NL*
_
You
_
stole
the
money
,
and
you
have
woven
a
plot
to
lay
the
sin
at
my
*NL*
door
.
But
you
may
prosper
,
for
all
that
:
there
is
no
just
God
that
*NL*
governs
the
earth
righteously
,
but
a
God
of
lies
,
that
bears
witness
*NL*
against
the
innocent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
shudder
at
this
blasphemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
said
meekly
,
``
I
leave
our
brethren
to
judge
whether
this
is
the
*NL*
voice
of
Satan
or
not
.
I
can
do
nothing
but
pray
for
you
,
Silas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Marner
went
out
with
that
despair
in
his
soul
--
that
shaken
trust
*NL*
in
God
and
man
,
which
is
little
short
of
madness
to
a
loving
nature
.
*NL*
In
the
bitterness
of
his
wounded
spirit
,
he
said
to
himself
,
''
_
She
_
*NL*
will
cast
me
off
too
.
''
And
he
reflected
that
,
if
she
did
not
believe
*NL*
the
testimony
against
him
,
her
whole
faith
must
be
upset
as
his
was
.
*NL*
To
people
accustomed
to
reason
about
the
forms
in
which
their
religious
*NL*
feeling
has
incorporated
itself
,
it
is
difficult
to
enter
into
that
*NL*
simple
,
untaught
state
of
mind
in
which
the
form
and
the
feeling
have
*NL*
never
been
severed
by
an
act
of
reflection
.
We
are
apt
to
think
it
*NL*
inevitable
that
a
man
in
Marner
's
position
should
have
begun
to
*NL*
question
the
validity
of
an
appeal
to
the
divine
judgment
by
drawing
*NL*
lots
;
but
to
him
this
would
have
been
an
effort
of
independent
thought
*NL*
such
as
he
had
never
known
;
and
he
must
have
made
the
effort
at
a
*NL*
moment
when
all
his
energies
were
turned
into
the
anguish
of
*NL*
disappointed
faith
.
If
there
is
an
angel
who
records
the
sorrows
of
*NL*
men
as
well
as
their
sins
,
he
knows
how
many
and
deep
are
the
sorrows
*NL*
that
spring
from
false
ideas
for
which
no
man
is
culpable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marner
went
home
,
and
for
a
whole
day
sat
alone
,
stunned
by
despair
,
*NL*
without
any
impulse
to
go
to
Sarah
and
attempt
to
win
her
belief
in
his
*NL*
innocence
.
The
second
day
he
took
refuge
from
benumbing
unbelief
,
by
*NL*
getting
into
his
loom
and
working
away
as
usual
;
and
before
many
hours
*NL*
were
past
,
the
minister
and
one
of
the
deacons
came
to
him
with
the
*NL*
message
from
Sarah
,
that
she
held
her
engagement
to
him
at
an
end
.
*NL*
Silas
received
the
message
mutely
,
and
then
turned
away
from
the
*NL*
messengers
to
work
at
his
loom
again
.
In
little
more
than
a
month
from
*NL*
that
time
,
Sarah
was
married
to
William
Dane
;
and
not
long
afterwards
*NL*
it
was
known
to
the
brethren
in
Lantern
Yard
that
Silas
Marner
had
*NL*
departed
from
the
town
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
Even
people
whose
lives
have
been
made
various
by
learning
,
sometimes
*NL*
find
it
hard
to
keep
a
fast
hold
on
their
habitual
views
of
life
,
on
*NL*
their
faith
in
the
Invisible
,
nay
,
on
the
sense
that
their
past
joys
*NL*
and
sorrows
are
a
real
experience
,
when
they
are
suddenly
transported
*NL*
to
a
new
land
,
where
the
beings
around
them
know
nothing
of
their
*NL*
history
,
and
share
none
of
their
ideas
--
where
their
mother
earth
shows
*NL*
another
lap
,
and
human
life
has
other
forms
than
those
on
which
their
*NL*
souls
have
been
nourished
.
Minds
that
have
been
unhinged
from
their
*NL*
old
faith
and
love
,
have
perhaps
sought
this
Lethean
influence
of
*NL*
exile
,
in
which
the
past
becomes
dreamy
because
its
symbols
have
all
*NL*
vanished
,
and
the
present
too
is
dreamy
because
it
is
linked
with
no
*NL*
memories
.
But
even
_
their
_
experience
may
hardly
enable
them
*NL*
thoroughly
to
imagine
what
was
the
effect
on
a
simple
weaver
like
Silas
*NL*
Marner
,
when
he
left
his
own
country
and
people
and
came
to
settle
in
*NL*
Raveloe
.
Nothing
could
be
more
unlike
his
native
town
,
set
within
*NL*
sight
of
the
widespread
hillsides
,
than
this
low
,
wooded
region
,
where
*NL*
he
felt
hidden
even
from
the
heavens
by
the
screening
trees
and
*NL*
hedgerows
.
There
was
nothing
here
,
when
he
rose
in
the
deep
morning
*NL*
quiet
and
looked
out
on
the
dewy
brambles
and
rank
tufted
grass
,
that
*NL*
seemed
to
have
any
relation
with
that
life
centring
in
Lantern
Yard
,
*NL*
which
had
once
been
to
him
the
altar-place
of
high
dispensations
.
The
*NL*
whitewashed
walls
;
the
little
pews
where
well-known
figures
entered
*NL*
with
a
subdued
rustling
,
and
where
first
one
well-known
voice
and
then
*NL*
another
,
pitched
in
a
peculiar
key
of
petition
,
uttered
phrases
at
once
*NL*
occult
and
familiar
,
like
the
amulet
worn
on
the
heart
;
the
pulpit
*NL*
where
the
minister
delivered
unquestioned
doctrine
,
and
swayed
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
and
handled
the
book
in
a
long
accustomed
manner
;
the
very
pauses
*NL*
between
the
couplets
of
the
hymn
,
as
it
was
given
out
,
and
the
*NL*
recurrent
swell
of
voices
in
song
:
these
things
had
been
the
channel
of
*NL*
divine
influences
to
Marner
--
they
were
the
fostering
home
of
his
*NL*
religious
emotions
--
they
were
Christianity
and
God
's
kingdom
upon
*NL*
earth
.
A
weaver
who
finds
hard
words
in
his
hymn-book
knows
nothing
of
*NL*
abstractions
;
as
the
little
child
knows
nothing
of
parental
love
,
but
*NL*
only
knows
one
face
and
one
lap
towards
which
it
stretches
its
arms
for
*NL*
refuge
and
nurture
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
could
be
more
unlike
that
Lantern
Yard
world
than
the
world
in
*NL*
Raveloe
?
--
orchards
looking
lazy
with
neglected
plenty
;
the
large
church
*NL*
in
the
wide
churchyard
,
which
men
gazed
at
lounging
at
their
own
doors
*NL*
in
service-time
;
the
purple-faced
farmers
jogging
along
the
lanes
or
*NL*
turning
in
at
the
Rainbow
;
homesteads
,
where
men
supped
heavily
and
*NL*
slept
in
the
light
of
the
evening
hearth
,
and
where
women
seemed
to
be
*NL*
laying
up
a
stock
of
linen
for
the
life
to
come
.
There
were
no
lips
in
*NL*
Raveloe
from
which
a
word
could
fall
that
would
stir
Silas
Marner
's
*NL*
benumbed
faith
to
a
sense
of
pain
.
In
the
early
ages
of
the
world
,
we
*NL*
know
,
it
was
believed
that
each
territory
was
inhabited
and
ruled
by
*NL*
its
own
divinities
,
so
that
a
man
could
cross
the
bordering
heights
and
*NL*
be
out
of
the
reach
of
his
native
gods
,
whose
presence
was
confined
to
*NL*
the
streams
and
the
groves
and
the
hills
among
which
he
had
lived
from
*NL*
his
birth
.
And
poor
Silas
was
vaguely
conscious
of
something
not
*NL*
unlike
the
feeling
of
primitive
men
,
when
they
fled
thus
,
in
fear
or
in
*NL*
sullenness
,
from
the
face
of
an
unpropitious
deity
.
It
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
the
Power
he
had
vainly
trusted
in
among
the
streets
and
at
the
*NL*
prayer-meetings
,
was
very
far
away
from
this
land
in
which
he
had
taken
*NL*
refuge
,
where
men
lived
in
careless
abundance
,
knowing
and
needing
*NL*
nothing
of
that
trust
,
which
,
for
him
,
had
been
turned
to
bitterness
.
*NL*
The
little
light
he
possessed
spread
its
beams
so
narrowly
,
that
*NL*
frustrated
belief
was
a
curtain
broad
enough
to
create
for
him
the
*NL*
blackness
of
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
movement
after
the
shock
had
been
to
work
in
his
loom
;
and
he
*NL*
went
on
with
this
unremittingly
,
never
asking
himself
why
,
now
he
was
*NL*
come
to
Raveloe
,
he
worked
far
on
into
the
night
to
finish
the
tale
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Osgood
's
table-linen
sooner
than
she
expected
--
without
*NL*
contemplating
beforehand
the
money
she
would
put
into
his
hand
for
the
*NL*
work
.
He
seemed
to
weave
,
like
the
spider
,
from
pure
impulse
,
without
*NL*
reflection
.
Every
man
's
work
,
pursued
steadily
,
tends
in
this
way
to
*NL*
become
an
end
in
itself
,
and
so
to
bridge
over
the
loveless
chasms
of
*NL*
his
life
.
Silas
's
hand
satisfied
itself
with
throwing
the
shuttle
,
and
*NL*
his
eye
with
seeing
the
little
squares
in
the
cloth
complete
themselves
*NL*
under
his
effort
.
Then
there
were
the
calls
of
hunger
;
and
Silas
,
in
*NL*
his
solitude
,
had
to
provide
his
own
breakfast
,
dinner
,
and
supper
,
to
*NL*
fetch
his
own
water
from
the
well
,
and
put
his
own
kettle
on
the
fire
;
*NL*
and
all
these
immediate
promptings
helped
,
along
with
the
weaving
,
to
*NL*
reduce
his
life
to
the
unquestioning
activity
of
a
spinning
insect
.
He
*NL*
hated
the
thought
of
the
past
;
there
was
nothing
that
called
out
his
*NL*
love
and
fellowship
toward
the
strangers
he
had
come
amongst
;
and
the
*NL*
future
was
all
dark
,
for
there
was
no
Unseen
Love
that
cared
for
him
.
*NL*
Thought
was
arrested
by
utter
bewilderment
,
now
its
old
narrow
pathway
*NL*
was
closed
,
and
affection
seemed
to
have
died
under
the
bruise
that
had
*NL*
fallen
on
its
keenest
nerves
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
last
Mrs.
Osgood
's
table-linen
was
finished
,
and
Silas
was
paid
*NL*
in
gold
.
His
earnings
in
his
native
town
,
where
he
worked
for
a
*NL*
wholesale
dealer
,
had
been
after
a
lower
rate
;
he
had
been
paid
weekly
,
*NL*
and
of
his
weekly
earnings
a
large
proportion
had
gone
to
objects
of
*NL*
piety
and
charity
.
Now
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
he
had
five
*NL*
bright
guineas
put
into
his
hand
;
no
man
expected
a
share
of
them
,
and
*NL*
he
loved
no
man
that
he
should
offer
him
a
share
.
But
what
were
the
*NL*
guineas
to
him
who
saw
no
vista
beyond
countless
days
of
weaving
?
It
*NL*
was
needless
for
him
to
ask
that
,
for
it
was
pleasant
to
him
to
feel
*NL*
them
in
his
palm
,
and
look
at
their
bright
faces
,
which
were
all
his
*NL*
own
:
it
was
another
element
of
life
,
like
the
weaving
and
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
hunger
,
subsisting
quite
aloof
from
the
life
of
belief
*NL*
and
love
from
which
he
had
been
cut
off
.
The
weaver
's
hand
had
known
*NL*
the
touch
of
hard-won
money
even
before
the
palm
had
grown
to
its
full
*NL*
breadth
;
for
twenty
years
,
mysterious
money
had
stood
to
him
as
the
*NL*
symbol
of
earthly
good
,
and
the
immediate
object
of
toil
.
He
had
*NL*
seemed
to
love
it
little
in
the
years
when
every
penny
had
its
purpose
*NL*
for
him
;
for
he
loved
the
_
purpose
_
then
.
But
now
,
when
all
purpose
*NL*
was
gone
,
that
habit
of
looking
towards
the
money
and
grasping
it
with
*NL*
a
sense
of
fulfilled
effort
made
a
loam
that
was
deep
enough
for
the
*NL*
seeds
of
desire
;
and
as
Silas
walked
homeward
across
the
fields
in
the
*NL*
twilight
,
he
drew
out
the
money
and
thought
it
was
brighter
in
the
*NL*
gathering
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
an
incident
happened
which
seemed
to
open
a
possibility
*NL*
of
some
fellowship
with
his
neighbours
.
One
day
,
taking
a
pair
of
*NL*
shoes
to
be
mended
,
he
saw
the
cobbler
's
wife
seated
by
the
fire
,
*NL*
suffering
from
the
terrible
symptoms
of
heart-disease
and
dropsy
,
which
*NL*
he
had
witnessed
as
the
precursors
of
his
mother
's
death
.
He
felt
a
*NL*
rush
of
pity
at
the
mingled
sight
and
remembrance
,
and
,
recalling
the
*NL*
relief
his
mother
had
found
from
a
simple
preparation
of
foxglove
,
he
*NL*
promised
Sally
Oates
to
bring
her
something
that
would
ease
her
,
since
*NL*
the
doctor
did
her
no
good
.
In
this
office
of
charity
,
Silas
felt
,
for
*NL*
the
first
time
since
he
had
come
to
Raveloe
,
a
sense
of
unity
between
*NL*
his
past
and
present
life
,
which
might
have
been
the
beginning
of
his
*NL*
rescue
from
the
insect-like
existence
into
which
his
nature
had
shrunk
.
*NL*
But
Sally
Oates
's
disease
had
raised
her
into
a
personage
of
much
*NL*
interest
and
importance
among
the
neighbours
,
and
the
fact
of
her
*NL*
having
found
relief
from
drinking
Silas
Marner
's
``
stuff
''
became
a
*NL*
matter
of
general
discourse
.
When
Doctor
Kimble
gave
physic
,
it
was
*NL*
natural
that
it
should
have
an
effect
;
but
when
a
weaver
,
who
came
from
*NL*
nobody
knew
where
,
worked
wonders
with
a
bottle
of
brown
waters
,
the
*NL*
occult
character
of
the
process
was
evident
.
Such
a
sort
of
thing
had
*NL*
not
been
known
since
the
Wise
Woman
at
Tarley
died
;
and
she
had
charms
*NL*
as
well
as
``
stuff
''
:
everybody
went
to
her
when
their
children
had
fits
.
*NL*
Silas
Marner
must
be
a
person
of
the
same
sort
,
for
how
did
he
know
*NL*
what
would
bring
back
Sally
Oates
's
breath
,
if
he
did
n't
know
a
fine
*NL*
sight
more
than
that
?
The
Wise
Woman
had
words
that
she
muttered
to
*NL*
herself
,
so
that
you
could
n't
hear
what
they
were
,
and
if
she
tied
a
*NL*
bit
of
red
thread
round
the
child
's
toe
the
while
,
it
would
keep
off
*NL*
the
water
in
the
head
.
There
were
women
in
Raveloe
,
at
that
present
*NL*
time
,
who
had
worn
one
of
the
Wise
Woman
's
little
bags
round
their
*NL*
necks
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
had
never
had
an
idiot
child
,
as
Ann
*NL*
Coulter
had
.
Silas
Marner
could
very
likely
do
as
much
,
and
more
;
and
*NL*
now
it
was
all
clear
how
he
should
have
come
from
unknown
parts
,
and
be
*NL*
so
``
comical-looking
''
.
But
Sally
Oates
must
mind
and
not
tell
the
*NL*
doctor
,
for
he
would
be
sure
to
set
his
face
against
Marner
:
he
was
*NL*
always
angry
about
the
Wise
Woman
,
and
used
to
threaten
those
who
went
*NL*
to
her
that
they
should
have
none
of
his
help
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
now
found
himself
and
his
cottage
suddenly
beset
by
mothers
who
*NL*
wanted
him
to
charm
away
the
whooping-cough
,
or
bring
back
the
milk
,
*NL*
and
by
men
who
wanted
stuff
against
the
rheumatics
or
the
knots
in
the
*NL*
hands
;
and
,
to
secure
themselves
against
a
refusal
,
the
applicants
*NL*
brought
silver
in
their
palms
.
Silas
might
have
driven
a
profitable
*NL*
trade
in
charms
as
well
as
in
his
small
list
of
drugs
;
but
money
on
*NL*
this
condition
was
no
temptation
to
him
:
he
had
never
known
an
impulse
*NL*
towards
falsity
,
and
he
drove
one
after
another
away
with
growing
*NL*
irritation
,
for
the
news
of
him
as
a
wise
man
had
spread
even
to
*NL*
Tarley
,
and
it
was
long
before
people
ceased
to
take
long
walks
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
asking
his
aid
.
But
the
hope
in
his
wisdom
was
at
length
*NL*
changed
into
dread
,
for
no
one
believed
him
when
he
said
he
knew
no
*NL*
charms
and
could
work
no
cures
,
and
every
man
and
woman
who
had
an
*NL*
accident
or
a
new
attack
after
applying
to
him
,
set
the
misfortune
down
*NL*
to
Master
Marner
's
ill-will
and
irritated
glances
.
Thus
it
came
to
*NL*
pass
that
his
movement
of
pity
towards
Sally
Oates
,
which
had
given
him
*NL*
a
transient
sense
of
brotherhood
,
heightened
the
repulsion
between
him
*NL*
and
his
neighbours
,
and
made
his
isolation
more
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
the
guineas
,
the
crowns
,
and
the
half-crowns
grew
to
a
heap
,
*NL*
and
Marner
drew
less
and
less
for
his
own
wants
,
trying
to
solve
the
*NL*
problem
of
keeping
himself
strong
enough
to
work
sixteen
hours
a-day
on
*NL*
as
small
an
outlay
as
possible
.
Have
not
men
,
shut
up
in
solitary
*NL*
imprisonment
,
found
an
interest
in
marking
the
moments
by
straight
*NL*
strokes
of
a
certain
length
on
the
wall
,
until
the
growth
of
the
sum
of
*NL*
straight
strokes
,
arranged
in
triangles
,
has
become
a
mastering
*NL*
purpose
?
Do
we
not
wile
away
moments
of
inanity
or
fatigued
waiting
by
*NL*
repeating
some
trivial
movement
or
sound
,
until
the
repetition
has
bred
*NL*
a
want
,
which
is
incipient
habit
?
That
will
help
us
to
understand
how
*NL*
the
love
of
accumulating
money
grows
an
absorbing
passion
in
men
whose
*NL*
imaginations
,
even
in
the
very
beginning
of
their
hoard
,
showed
them
no
*NL*
purpose
beyond
it
.
Marner
wanted
the
heaps
of
ten
to
grow
into
a
*NL*
square
,
and
then
into
a
larger
square
;
and
every
added
guinea
,
while
it
*NL*
was
itself
a
satisfaction
,
bred
a
new
desire
.
In
this
strange
world
,
*NL*
made
a
hopeless
riddle
to
him
,
he
might
,
if
he
had
had
a
less
intense
*NL*
nature
,
have
sat
weaving
,
weaving
--
looking
towards
the
end
of
his
*NL*
pattern
,
or
towards
the
end
of
his
web
,
till
he
forgot
the
riddle
,
and
*NL*
everything
else
but
his
immediate
sensations
;
but
the
money
had
come
to
*NL*
mark
off
his
weaving
into
periods
,
and
the
money
not
only
grew
,
but
it
*NL*
remained
with
him
.
He
began
to
think
it
was
conscious
of
him
,
as
his
*NL*
loom
was
,
and
he
would
on
no
account
have
exchanged
those
coins
,
which
*NL*
had
become
his
familiars
,
for
other
coins
with
unknown
faces
.
He
*NL*
handled
them
,
he
counted
them
,
till
their
form
and
colour
were
like
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
a
thirst
to
him
;
but
it
was
only
in
the
night
,
when
his
*NL*
work
was
done
,
that
he
drew
them
out
to
enjoy
their
companionship
.
He
*NL*
had
taken
up
some
bricks
in
his
floor
underneath
his
loom
,
and
here
he
*NL*
had
made
a
hole
in
which
he
set
the
iron
pot
that
contained
his
guineas
*NL*
and
silver
coins
,
covering
the
bricks
with
sand
whenever
he
replaced
*NL*
them
.
Not
that
the
idea
of
being
robbed
presented
itself
often
or
*NL*
strongly
to
his
mind
:
hoarding
was
common
in
country
districts
in
those
*NL*
days
;
there
were
old
labourers
in
the
parish
of
Raveloe
who
were
known
*NL*
to
have
their
savings
by
them
,
probably
inside
their
flock-beds
;
but
*NL*
their
rustic
neighbours
,
though
not
all
of
them
as
honest
as
their
*NL*
ancestors
in
the
days
of
King
Alfred
,
had
not
imaginations
bold
enough
*NL*
to
lay
a
plan
of
burglary
.
How
could
they
have
spent
the
money
in
*NL*
their
own
village
without
betraying
themselves
?
They
would
be
obliged
*NL*
to
``
run
away
''
--
a
course
as
dark
and
dubious
as
a
balloon
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
year
after
year
,
Silas
Marner
had
lived
in
this
solitude
,
his
*NL*
guineas
rising
in
the
iron
pot
,
and
his
life
narrowing
and
hardening
*NL*
itself
more
and
more
into
a
mere
pulsation
of
desire
and
satisfaction
*NL*
that
had
no
relation
to
any
other
being
.
His
life
had
reduced
itself
*NL*
to
the
functions
of
weaving
and
hoarding
,
without
any
contemplation
of
*NL*
an
end
towards
which
the
functions
tended
.
The
same
sort
of
process
*NL*
has
perhaps
been
undergone
by
wiser
men
,
when
they
have
been
cut
off
*NL*
from
faith
and
love
--
only
,
instead
of
a
loom
and
a
heap
of
guineas
,
*NL*
they
have
had
some
erudite
research
,
some
ingenious
project
,
or
some
*NL*
well-knit
theory
.
Strangely
Marner
's
face
and
figure
shrank
and
bent
*NL*
themselves
into
a
constant
mechanical
relation
to
the
objects
of
his
*NL*
life
,
so
that
he
produced
the
same
sort
of
impression
as
a
handle
or
a
*NL*
crooked
tube
,
which
has
no
meaning
standing
apart
.
The
prominent
eyes
*NL*
that
used
to
look
trusting
and
dreamy
,
now
looked
as
if
they
had
been
*NL*
made
to
see
only
one
kind
of
thing
that
was
very
small
,
like
tiny
*NL*
grain
,
for
which
they
hunted
everywhere
:
and
he
was
so
withered
and
*NL*
yellow
,
that
,
though
he
was
not
yet
forty
,
the
children
always
called
*NL*
him
``
Old
Master
Marner
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
even
in
this
stage
of
withering
a
little
incident
happened
,
which
*NL*
showed
that
the
sap
of
affection
was
not
all
gone
.
It
was
one
of
his
*NL*
daily
tasks
to
fetch
his
water
from
a
well
a
couple
of
fields
off
,
and
*NL*
for
this
purpose
,
ever
since
he
came
to
Raveloe
,
he
had
had
a
brown
*NL*
earthenware
pot
,
which
he
held
as
his
most
precious
utensil
among
the
*NL*
very
few
conveniences
he
had
granted
himself
.
It
had
been
his
*NL*
companion
for
twelve
years
,
always
standing
on
the
same
spot
,
always
*NL*
lending
its
handle
to
him
in
the
early
morning
,
so
that
its
form
had
an
*NL*
expression
for
him
of
willing
helpfulness
,
and
the
impress
of
its
*NL*
handle
on
his
palm
gave
a
satisfaction
mingled
with
that
of
having
the
*NL*
fresh
clear
water
.
One
day
as
he
was
returning
from
the
well
,
he
*NL*
stumbled
against
the
step
of
the
stile
,
and
his
brown
pot
,
falling
with
*NL*
force
against
the
stones
that
overarched
the
ditch
below
him
,
was
*NL*
broken
in
three
pieces
.
Silas
picked
up
the
pieces
and
carried
them
*NL*
home
with
grief
in
his
heart
.
The
brown
pot
could
never
be
of
use
to
*NL*
him
any
more
,
but
he
stuck
the
bits
together
and
propped
the
ruin
in
*NL*
its
old
place
for
a
memorial
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
history
of
Silas
Marner
,
until
the
fifteenth
year
after
he
*NL*
came
to
Raveloe
.
The
livelong
day
he
sat
in
his
loom
,
his
ear
filled
*NL*
with
its
monotony
,
his
eyes
bent
close
down
on
the
slow
growth
of
*NL*
sameness
in
the
brownish
web
,
his
muscles
moving
with
such
even
*NL*
repetition
that
their
pause
seemed
almost
as
much
a
constraint
as
the
*NL*
holding
of
his
breath
.
But
at
night
came
his
revelry
:
at
night
he
*NL*
closed
his
shutters
,
and
made
fast
his
doors
,
and
drew
forth
his
gold
.
*NL*
Long
ago
the
heap
of
coins
had
become
too
large
for
the
iron
pot
to
*NL*
hold
them
,
and
he
had
made
for
them
two
thick
leather
bags
,
which
*NL*
wasted
no
room
in
their
resting-place
,
but
lent
themselves
flexibly
to
*NL*
every
corner
.
How
the
guineas
shone
as
they
came
pouring
out
of
the
*NL*
dark
leather
mouths
!
The
silver
bore
no
large
proportion
in
amount
to
*NL*
the
gold
,
because
the
long
pieces
of
linen
which
formed
his
chief
work
*NL*
were
always
partly
paid
for
in
gold
,
and
out
of
the
silver
he
supplied
*NL*
his
own
bodily
wants
,
choosing
always
the
shillings
and
sixpences
to
*NL*
spend
in
this
way
.
He
loved
the
guineas
best
,
but
he
would
not
change
*NL*
the
silver
--
the
crowns
and
half-crowns
that
were
his
own
earnings
,
*NL*
begotten
by
his
labour
;
he
loved
them
all
.
He
spread
them
out
in
heaps
*NL*
and
bathed
his
hands
in
them
;
then
he
counted
them
and
set
them
up
in
*NL*
regular
piles
,
and
felt
their
rounded
outline
between
his
thumb
and
*NL*
fingers
,
and
thought
fondly
of
the
guineas
that
were
only
half-earned
*NL*
by
the
work
in
his
loom
,
as
if
they
had
been
unborn
children
--
thought
*NL*
of
the
guineas
that
were
coming
slowly
through
the
coming
years
,
*NL*
through
all
his
life
,
which
spread
far
away
before
him
,
the
end
quite
*NL*
hidden
by
countless
days
of
weaving
.
No
wonder
his
thoughts
were
still
*NL*
with
his
loom
and
his
money
when
he
made
his
journeys
through
the
*NL*
fields
and
the
lanes
to
fetch
and
carry
home
his
work
,
so
that
his
*NL*
steps
never
wandered
to
the
hedge-banks
and
the
lane-side
in
search
of
*NL*
the
once
familiar
herbs
:
these
too
belonged
to
the
past
,
from
which
his
*NL*
life
had
shrunk
away
,
like
a
rivulet
that
has
sunk
far
down
from
the
*NL*
grassy
fringe
of
its
old
breadth
into
a
little
shivering
thread
,
that
*NL*
cuts
a
groove
for
itself
in
the
barren
sand
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
about
the
Christmas
of
that
fifteenth
year
,
a
second
great
change
*NL*
came
over
Marner
's
life
,
and
his
history
became
blent
in
a
singular
*NL*
manner
with
the
life
of
his
neighbours
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
greatest
man
in
Raveloe
was
Squire
Cass
,
who
lived
in
the
large
red
*NL*
house
with
the
handsome
flight
of
stone
steps
in
front
and
the
high
*NL*
stables
behind
it
,
nearly
opposite
the
church
.
He
was
only
one
among
*NL*
several
landed
parishioners
,
but
he
alone
was
honoured
with
the
title
*NL*
of
Squire
;
for
though
Mr.
Osgood
's
family
was
also
understood
to
be
of
*NL*
timeless
origin
--
the
Raveloe
imagination
having
never
ventured
back
to
*NL*
that
fearful
blank
when
there
were
no
Osgoods
--
still
,
he
merely
owned
*NL*
the
farm
he
occupied
;
whereas
Squire
Cass
had
a
tenant
or
two
,
who
*NL*
complained
of
the
game
to
him
quite
as
if
he
had
been
a
lord
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
still
that
glorious
war-time
which
was
felt
to
be
a
peculiar
*NL*
favour
of
Providence
towards
the
landed
interest
,
and
the
fall
of
*NL*
prices
had
not
yet
come
to
carry
the
race
of
small
squires
and
yeomen
*NL*
down
that
road
to
ruin
for
which
extravagant
habits
and
bad
husbandry
*NL*
were
plentifully
anointing
their
wheels
.
I
am
speaking
now
in
relation
*NL*
to
Raveloe
and
the
parishes
that
resembled
it
;
for
our
old-fashioned
*NL*
country
life
had
many
different
aspects
,
as
all
life
must
have
when
it
*NL*
is
spread
over
a
various
surface
,
and
breathed
on
variously
by
*NL*
multitudinous
currents
,
from
the
winds
of
heaven
to
the
thoughts
of
*NL*
men
,
which
are
for
ever
moving
and
crossing
each
other
with
*NL*
incalculable
results
.
Raveloe
lay
low
among
the
bushy
trees
and
the
*NL*
rutted
lanes
,
aloof
from
the
currents
of
industrial
energy
and
Puritan
*NL*
earnestness
:
the
rich
ate
and
drank
freely
,
accepting
gout
and
apoplexy
*NL*
as
things
that
ran
mysteriously
in
respectable
families
,
and
the
poor
*NL*
thought
that
the
rich
were
entirely
in
the
right
of
it
to
lead
a
jolly
*NL*
life
;
besides
,
their
feasting
caused
a
multiplication
of
orts
,
which
*NL*
were
the
heirlooms
of
the
poor
.
Betty
Jay
scented
the
boiling
of
*NL*
Squire
Cass
's
hams
,
but
her
longing
was
arrested
by
the
unctuous
liquor
*NL*
in
which
they
were
boiled
;
and
when
the
seasons
brought
round
the
great
*NL*
merry-makings
,
they
were
regarded
on
all
hands
as
a
fine
thing
for
the
*NL*
poor
.
For
the
Raveloe
feasts
were
like
the
rounds
of
beef
and
the
*NL*
barrels
of
ale
--
they
were
on
a
large
scale
,
and
lasted
a
good
while
,
*NL*
especially
in
the
winter-time
.
After
ladies
had
packed
up
their
best
*NL*
gowns
and
top-knots
in
bandboxes
,
and
had
incurred
the
risk
of
fording
*NL*
streams
on
pillions
with
the
precious
burden
in
rainy
or
snowy
weather
,
*NL*
when
there
was
no
knowing
how
high
the
water
would
rise
,
it
was
not
to
*NL*
be
supposed
that
they
looked
forward
to
a
brief
pleasure
.
On
this
*NL*
ground
it
was
always
contrived
in
the
dark
seasons
,
when
there
was
*NL*
little
work
to
be
done
,
and
the
hours
were
long
,
that
several
*NL*
neighbours
should
keep
open
house
in
succession
.
So
soon
as
Squire
*NL*
Cass
's
standing
dishes
diminished
in
plenty
and
freshness
,
his
guests
*NL*
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
walk
a
little
higher
up
the
village
to
Mr.
*NL*
Osgood
's
,
at
the
Orchards
,
and
they
found
hams
and
chines
uncut
,
*NL*
pork-pies
with
the
scent
of
the
fire
in
them
,
spun
butter
in
all
its
*NL*
freshness
--
everything
,
in
fact
,
that
appetites
at
leisure
could
desire
,
*NL*
in
perhaps
greater
perfection
,
though
not
in
greater
abundance
,
than
at
*NL*
Squire
Cass
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
Squire
's
wife
had
died
long
ago
,
and
the
Red
House
was
without
*NL*
that
presence
of
the
wife
and
mother
which
is
the
fountain
of
wholesome
*NL*
love
and
fear
in
parlour
and
kitchen
;
and
this
helped
to
account
not
*NL*
only
for
there
being
more
profusion
than
finished
excellence
in
the
*NL*
holiday
provisions
,
but
also
for
the
frequency
with
which
the
proud
*NL*
Squire
condescended
to
preside
in
the
parlour
of
the
Rainbow
rather
*NL*
than
under
the
shadow
of
his
own
dark
wainscot
;
perhaps
,
also
,
for
the
*NL*
fact
that
his
sons
had
turned
out
rather
ill
.
Raveloe
was
not
a
place
*NL*
where
moral
censure
was
severe
,
but
it
was
thought
a
weakness
in
the
*NL*
Squire
that
he
had
kept
all
his
sons
at
home
in
idleness
;
and
though
*NL*
some
licence
was
to
be
allowed
to
young
men
whose
fathers
could
afford
*NL*
it
,
people
shook
their
heads
at
the
courses
of
the
second
son
,
Dunstan
,
*NL*
commonly
called
Dunsey
Cass
,
whose
taste
for
swopping
and
betting
might
*NL*
turn
out
to
be
a
sowing
of
something
worse
than
wild
oats
.
To
be
sure
,
*NL*
the
neighbours
said
,
it
was
no
matter
what
became
of
Dunsey
--
a
spiteful
*NL*
jeering
fellow
,
who
seemed
to
enjoy
his
drink
the
more
when
other
*NL*
people
went
dry
--
always
provided
that
his
doings
did
not
bring
trouble
*NL*
on
a
family
like
Squire
Cass
's
,
with
a
monument
in
the
church
,
and
*NL*
tankards
older
than
King
George
.
But
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
if
*NL*
Mr.
Godfrey
,
the
eldest
,
a
fine
open-faced
good-natured
young
man
who
*NL*
was
to
come
into
the
land
some
day
,
should
take
to
going
along
the
same
*NL*
road
with
his
brother
,
as
he
had
seemed
to
do
of
late
.
If
he
went
on
*NL*
in
that
way
,
he
would
lose
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
;
for
it
was
well
known
*NL*
that
she
had
looked
very
shyly
on
him
ever
since
last
Whitsuntide
*NL*
twelvemonth
,
when
there
was
so
much
talk
about
his
being
away
from
home
*NL*
days
and
days
together
.
There
was
something
wrong
,
more
than
*NL*
common
--
that
was
quite
clear
;
for
Mr.
Godfrey
did
n't
look
half
so
*NL*
fresh-coloured
and
open
as
he
used
to
do
.
At
one
time
everybody
was
*NL*
saying
,
What
a
handsome
couple
he
and
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
would
make
!
*NL*
and
if
she
could
come
to
be
mistress
at
the
Red
House
,
there
would
be
a
*NL*
fine
change
,
for
the
Lammeters
had
been
brought
up
in
that
way
,
that
*NL*
they
never
suffered
a
pinch
of
salt
to
be
wasted
,
and
yet
everybody
in
*NL*
their
household
had
of
the
best
,
according
to
his
place
.
Such
a
*NL*
daughter-in-law
would
be
a
saving
to
the
old
Squire
,
if
she
never
*NL*
brought
a
penny
to
her
fortune
;
for
it
was
to
be
feared
that
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
his
incomings
,
there
were
more
holes
in
his
pocket
than
*NL*
the
one
where
he
put
his
own
hand
in
.
But
if
Mr.
Godfrey
did
n't
turn
*NL*
over
a
new
leaf
,
he
might
say
``
Good-bye
''
to
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
once
hopeful
Godfrey
who
was
standing
,
with
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
side-pockets
and
his
back
to
the
fire
,
in
the
dark
wainscoted
parlour
,
*NL*
one
late
November
afternoon
in
that
fifteenth
year
of
Silas
Marner
's
*NL*
life
at
Raveloe
.
The
fading
grey
light
fell
dimly
on
the
walls
*NL*
decorated
with
guns
,
whips
,
and
foxes
'
brushes
,
on
coats
and
hats
flung
*NL*
on
the
chairs
,
on
tankards
sending
forth
a
scent
of
flat
ale
,
and
on
a
*NL*
half-choked
fire
,
with
pipes
propped
up
in
the
chimney-corners
:
signs
*NL*
of
a
domestic
life
destitute
of
any
hallowing
charm
,
with
which
the
*NL*
look
of
gloomy
vexation
on
Godfrey
's
blond
face
was
in
sad
accordance
.
*NL*
He
seemed
to
be
waiting
and
listening
for
some
one
's
approach
,
and
*NL*
presently
the
sound
of
a
heavy
step
,
with
an
accompanying
whistle
,
was
*NL*
heard
across
the
large
empty
entrance-hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
,
and
a
thick-set
,
heavy-looking
young
man
entered
,
with
*NL*
the
flushed
face
and
the
gratuitously
elated
bearing
which
mark
the
*NL*
first
stage
of
intoxication
.
It
was
Dunsey
,
and
at
the
sight
of
him
*NL*
Godfrey
's
face
parted
with
some
of
its
gloom
to
take
on
the
more
active
*NL*
expression
of
hatred
.
The
handsome
brown
spaniel
that
lay
on
the
*NL*
hearth
retreated
under
the
chair
in
the
chimney-corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Master
Godfrey
,
what
do
you
want
with
me
?
''
said
Dunsey
,
in
a
*NL*
mocking
tone
.
``
You
're
my
elders
and
betters
,
you
know
;
I
was
obliged
*NL*
to
come
when
you
sent
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
is
what
I
want
--
and
just
shake
yourself
sober
and
listen
,
*NL*
will
you
?
''
said
Godfrey
,
savagely
.
He
had
himself
been
drinking
more
*NL*
than
was
good
for
him
,
trying
to
turn
his
gloom
into
uncalculating
*NL*
anger
.
``
I
want
to
tell
you
,
I
must
hand
over
that
rent
of
Fowler
's
to
*NL*
the
Squire
,
or
else
tell
him
I
gave
it
you
;
for
he
's
threatening
to
*NL*
distrain
for
it
,
and
it
'll
all
be
out
soon
,
whether
I
tell
him
or
not
.
*NL*
He
said
,
just
now
,
before
he
went
out
,
he
should
send
word
to
Cox
to
*NL*
distrain
,
if
Fowler
did
n't
come
and
pay
up
his
arrears
this
week
.
The
*NL*
Squire
's
short
o
'
cash
,
and
in
no
humour
to
stand
any
nonsense
;
and
you
*NL*
know
what
he
threatened
,
if
ever
he
found
you
making
away
with
his
*NL*
money
again
.
So
,
see
and
get
the
money
,
and
pretty
quickly
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Dunsey
,
sneeringly
,
coming
nearer
to
his
brother
and
*NL*
looking
in
his
face
.
``
Suppose
,
now
,
you
get
the
money
yourself
,
and
*NL*
save
me
the
trouble
,
eh
?
Since
you
was
so
kind
as
to
hand
it
over
to
*NL*
me
,
you
'll
not
refuse
me
the
kindness
to
pay
it
back
for
me
:
it
was
*NL*
your
brotherly
love
made
you
do
it
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
bit
his
lips
and
clenched
his
fist
.
``
Do
n't
come
near
me
with
*NL*
that
look
,
else
I
'll
knock
you
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
you
wo
n't
,
''
said
Dunsey
,
turning
away
on
his
heel
,
however
.
*NL*
``
Because
I
'm
such
a
good-natured
brother
,
you
know
.
I
might
get
you
*NL*
turned
out
of
house
and
home
,
and
cut
off
with
a
shilling
any
day
.
I
*NL*
might
tell
the
Squire
how
his
handsome
son
was
married
to
that
nice
*NL*
young
woman
,
Molly
Farren
,
and
was
very
unhappy
because
he
could
n't
*NL*
live
with
his
drunken
wife
,
and
I
should
slip
into
your
place
as
*NL*
comfortable
as
could
be
.
But
you
see
,
I
do
n't
do
it
--
I
'm
so
easy
and
*NL*
good-natured
.
You
'll
take
any
trouble
for
me
.
You
'll
get
the
hundred
*NL*
pounds
for
me
--
I
know
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
get
the
money
?
''
said
Godfrey
,
quivering
.
``
I
have
n't
a
*NL*
shilling
to
bless
myself
with
.
And
it
's
a
lie
that
you
'd
slip
into
my
*NL*
place
:
you
'd
get
yourself
turned
out
too
,
that
's
all
.
For
if
you
begin
*NL*
telling
tales
,
I
'll
follow
.
Bob
's
my
father
's
favourite
--
you
know
that
*NL*
very
well
.
He
'd
only
think
himself
well
rid
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
said
Dunsey
,
nodding
his
head
sideways
as
he
looked
out
*NL*
of
the
window
.
``
It
`
ud
be
very
pleasant
to
me
to
go
in
your
*NL*
company
--
you
're
such
a
handsome
brother
,
and
we
've
always
been
so
fond
*NL*
of
quarrelling
with
one
another
,
I
should
n't
know
what
to
do
without
*NL*
you
.
But
you
'd
like
better
for
us
both
to
stay
at
home
together
;
I
*NL*
know
you
would
.
So
you
'll
manage
to
get
that
little
sum
o
'
money
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
bid
you
good-bye
,
though
I
'm
sorry
to
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dunstan
was
moving
off
,
but
Godfrey
rushed
after
him
and
seized
him
by
*NL*
the
arm
,
saying
,
with
an
oath
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
I
have
no
money
:
I
can
get
no
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Borrow
of
old
Kimble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
he
wo
n't
lend
me
any
more
,
and
I
sha
n't
ask
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
sell
Wildfire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
easy
talking
.
I
must
have
the
money
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
've
only
got
to
ride
him
to
the
hunt
to-morrow
.
There
'll
be
*NL*
Bryce
and
Keating
there
,
for
sure
.
You
'll
get
more
bids
than
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
daresay
,
and
get
back
home
at
eight
o'clock
,
splashed
up
to
the
*NL*
chin
.
I
'm
going
to
Mrs.
Osgood
's
birthday
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho
!
''
said
Dunsey
,
turning
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
trying
to
speak
*NL*
in
a
small
mincing
treble
.
``
And
there
's
sweet
Miss
Nancy
coming
;
and
*NL*
we
shall
dance
with
her
,
and
promise
never
to
be
naughty
again
,
and
be
*NL*
taken
into
favour
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
about
Miss
Nancy
,
you
fool
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
turning
*NL*
red
,
``
else
I
'll
throttle
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
said
Dunsey
,
still
in
an
artificial
tone
,
but
taking
a
*NL*
whip
from
the
table
and
beating
the
butt-end
of
it
on
his
palm
.
``
You
've
*NL*
a
very
good
chance
.
I
'd
advise
you
to
creep
up
her
sleeve
again
:
it
*NL*
`
ud
be
saving
time
,
if
Molly
should
happen
to
take
a
drop
too
much
*NL*
laudanum
some
day
,
and
make
a
widower
of
you
.
Miss
Nancy
would
n't
mind
*NL*
being
a
second
,
if
she
did
n't
know
it
.
And
you
've
got
a
good-natured
*NL*
brother
,
who
'll
keep
your
secret
well
,
because
you
'll
be
so
very
*NL*
obliging
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
quivering
,
and
pale
again
,
*NL*
``
my
patience
is
pretty
near
at
an
end
.
If
you
'd
a
little
more
*NL*
sharpness
in
you
,
you
might
know
that
you
may
urge
a
man
a
bit
too
far
,
*NL*
and
make
one
leap
as
easy
as
another
.
I
do
n't
know
but
what
it
is
so
*NL*
now
:
I
may
as
well
tell
the
Squire
everything
myself
--
I
should
get
you
*NL*
off
my
back
,
if
I
got
nothing
else
.
And
,
after
all
,
he
'll
know
some
*NL*
time
.
She
's
been
threatening
to
come
herself
and
tell
him
.
So
,
do
n't
*NL*
flatter
yourself
that
your
secrecy
's
worth
any
price
you
choose
to
ask
.
*NL*
You
drain
me
of
money
till
I
have
got
nothing
to
pacify
_
her
_
with
,
and
*NL*
she
'll
do
as
she
threatens
some
day
.
It
's
all
one
.
I
'll
tell
my
*NL*
father
everything
myself
,
and
you
may
go
to
the
devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dunsey
perceived
that
he
had
overshot
his
mark
,
and
that
there
was
a
*NL*
point
at
which
even
the
hesitating
Godfrey
might
be
driven
into
*NL*
decision
.
But
he
said
,
with
an
air
of
unconcern
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
;
but
I
'll
have
a
draught
of
ale
first
.
''
And
ringing
the
*NL*
bell
,
he
threw
himself
across
two
chairs
,
and
began
to
rap
the
*NL*
window-seat
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
stood
,
still
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
uneasily
moving
his
*NL*
fingers
among
the
contents
of
his
side-pockets
,
and
looking
at
the
*NL*
floor
.
That
big
muscular
frame
of
his
held
plenty
of
animal
courage
,
*NL*
but
helped
him
to
no
decision
when
the
dangers
to
be
braved
were
such
*NL*
as
could
neither
be
knocked
down
nor
throttled
.
His
natural
*NL*
irresolution
and
moral
cowardice
were
exaggerated
by
a
position
in
*NL*
which
dreaded
consequences
seemed
to
press
equally
on
all
sides
,
and
*NL*
his
irritation
had
no
sooner
provoked
him
to
defy
Dunstan
and
*NL*
anticipate
all
possible
betrayals
,
than
the
miseries
he
must
bring
on
*NL*
himself
by
such
a
step
seemed
more
unendurable
to
him
than
the
present
*NL*
evil
.
The
results
of
confession
were
not
contingent
,
they
were
*NL*
certain
;
whereas
betrayal
was
not
certain
.
From
the
near
vision
of
that
*NL*
certainty
he
fell
back
on
suspense
and
vacillation
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
repose
.
The
disinherited
son
of
a
small
squire
,
equally
disinclined
to
*NL*
dig
and
to
beg
,
was
almost
as
helpless
as
an
uprooted
tree
,
which
,
by
*NL*
the
favour
of
earth
and
sky
,
has
grown
to
a
handsome
bulk
on
the
spot
*NL*
where
it
first
shot
upward
.
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
possible
to
*NL*
think
of
digging
with
some
cheerfulness
if
Nancy
Lammeter
were
to
be
*NL*
won
on
those
terms
;
but
,
since
he
must
irrevocably
lose
_
her
_
as
well
*NL*
as
the
inheritance
,
and
must
break
every
tie
but
the
one
that
degraded
*NL*
him
and
left
him
without
motive
for
trying
to
recover
his
better
self
,
*NL*
he
could
imagine
no
future
for
himself
on
the
other
side
of
confession
*NL*
but
that
of
''
`
listing
for
a
soldier
''
--
the
most
desperate
step
,
short
of
*NL*
suicide
,
in
the
eyes
of
respectable
families
.
No
!
he
would
rather
*NL*
trust
to
casualties
than
to
his
own
resolve
--
rather
go
on
sitting
at
*NL*
the
feast
,
and
sipping
the
wine
he
loved
,
though
with
the
sword
hanging
*NL*
over
him
and
terror
in
his
heart
,
than
rush
away
into
the
cold
darkness
*NL*
where
there
was
no
pleasure
left
.
The
utmost
concession
to
Dunstan
*NL*
about
the
horse
began
to
seem
easy
,
compared
with
the
fulfilment
of
his
*NL*
own
threat
.
But
his
pride
would
not
let
him
recommence
the
*NL*
conversation
otherwise
than
by
continuing
the
quarrel
.
Dunstan
was
*NL*
waiting
for
this
,
and
took
his
ale
in
shorter
draughts
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
like
you
,
''
Godfrey
burst
out
,
in
a
bitter
tone
,
``
to
talk
*NL*
about
my
selling
Wildfire
in
that
cool
way
--
the
last
thing
I
've
got
to
*NL*
call
my
own
,
and
the
best
bit
of
horse-flesh
I
ever
had
in
my
life
.
*NL*
And
if
you
'd
got
a
spark
of
pride
in
you
,
you
'd
be
ashamed
to
see
the
*NL*
stables
emptied
,
and
everybody
sneering
about
it
.
But
it
's
my
belief
*NL*
you
'd
sell
yourself
,
if
it
was
only
for
the
pleasure
of
making
somebody
*NL*
feel
he
'd
got
a
bad
bargain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
said
Dunstan
,
very
placably
,
``
you
do
me
justice
,
I
see
.
*NL*
You
know
I
'm
a
jewel
for
`
ticing
people
into
bargains
.
For
which
*NL*
reason
I
advise
you
to
let
_
me
_
sell
Wildfire
.
I
'd
ride
him
to
the
*NL*
hunt
to-morrow
for
you
,
with
pleasure
.
I
should
n't
look
so
handsome
as
*NL*
you
in
the
saddle
,
but
it
's
the
horse
they
'll
bid
for
,
and
not
the
*NL*
rider
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
daresay
--
trust
my
horse
to
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
,
''
said
Dunstan
,
rapping
the
window-seat
again
with
an
*NL*
air
of
great
unconcern
.
``
It
's
_
you
_
have
got
to
pay
Fowler
's
money
;
*NL*
it
's
none
of
my
business
.
You
received
the
money
from
him
when
you
*NL*
went
to
Bramcote
,
and
_
you
_
told
the
Squire
it
was
n't
paid
.
I
'd
nothing
*NL*
to
do
with
that
;
you
chose
to
be
so
obliging
as
to
give
it
me
,
that
was
*NL*
all
.
If
you
do
n't
want
to
pay
the
money
,
let
it
alone
;
it
's
all
one
to
*NL*
me
.
But
I
was
willing
to
accommodate
you
by
undertaking
to
sell
the
*NL*
horse
,
seeing
it
's
not
convenient
to
you
to
go
so
far
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
was
silent
for
some
moments
.
He
would
have
liked
to
spring
on
*NL*
Dunstan
,
wrench
the
whip
from
his
hand
,
and
flog
him
to
within
an
inch
*NL*
of
his
life
;
and
no
bodily
fear
could
have
deterred
him
;
but
he
was
*NL*
mastered
by
another
sort
of
fear
,
which
was
fed
by
feelings
stronger
*NL*
even
than
his
resentment
.
When
he
spoke
again
,
it
was
in
a
*NL*
half-conciliatory
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
mean
no
nonsense
about
the
horse
,
eh
?
You
'll
sell
him
all
*NL*
fair
,
and
hand
over
the
money
?
If
you
do
n't
,
you
know
,
everything
`
ull
*NL*
go
to
smash
,
for
I
've
got
nothing
else
to
trust
to
.
And
you
'll
have
*NL*
less
pleasure
in
pulling
the
house
over
my
head
,
when
your
own
skull
's
*NL*
to
be
broken
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
said
Dunstan
,
rising
;
``
all
right
.
I
thought
you
'd
come
*NL*
round
.
I
'm
the
fellow
to
bring
old
Bryce
up
to
the
scratch
.
I
'll
get
*NL*
you
a
hundred
and
twenty
for
him
,
if
I
get
you
a
penny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
'll
perhaps
rain
cats
and
dogs
to-morrow
,
as
it
did
yesterday
,
*NL*
and
then
you
ca
n't
go
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
hardly
knowing
whether
he
wished
*NL*
for
that
obstacle
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
_
it
_
,
''
said
Dunstan
.
``
I
'm
always
lucky
in
my
weather
.
It
might
*NL*
rain
if
you
wanted
to
go
yourself
.
You
never
hold
trumps
,
you
know
--
I
*NL*
always
do
.
You
've
got
the
beauty
,
you
see
,
and
I
've
got
the
luck
,
so
*NL*
you
must
keep
me
by
you
for
your
crooked
sixpence
;
you
'll
_
ne
_
-
ver
get
*NL*
along
without
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
you
,
hold
your
tongue
!
''
said
Godfrey
,
impetuously
.
``
And
take
*NL*
care
to
keep
sober
to-morrow
,
else
you
'll
get
pitched
on
your
head
*NL*
coming
home
,
and
Wildfire
might
be
the
worse
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
your
tender
heart
easy
,
''
said
Dunstan
,
opening
the
door
.
``
You
*NL*
never
knew
me
see
double
when
I
'd
got
a
bargain
to
make
;
it
`
ud
spoil
*NL*
the
fun
.
Besides
,
whenever
I
fall
,
I
'm
warranted
to
fall
on
my
legs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
,
Dunstan
slammed
the
door
behind
him
,
and
left
Godfrey
to
*NL*
that
bitter
rumination
on
his
personal
circumstances
which
was
now
*NL*
unbroken
from
day
to
day
save
by
the
excitement
of
sporting
,
drinking
,
*NL*
card-playing
,
or
the
rarer
and
less
oblivious
pleasure
of
seeing
Miss
*NL*
Nancy
Lammeter
.
The
subtle
and
varied
pains
springing
from
the
higher
*NL*
sensibility
that
accompanies
higher
culture
,
are
perhaps
less
pitiable
*NL*
than
that
dreary
absence
of
impersonal
enjoyment
and
consolation
which
*NL*
leaves
ruder
minds
to
the
perpetual
urgent
companionship
of
their
own
*NL*
griefs
and
discontents
.
The
lives
of
those
rural
forefathers
,
whom
we
*NL*
are
apt
to
think
very
prosaic
figures
--
men
whose
only
work
was
to
ride
*NL*
round
their
land
,
getting
heavier
and
heavier
in
their
saddles
,
and
who
*NL*
passed
the
rest
of
their
days
in
the
half-listless
gratification
of
*NL*
senses
dulled
by
monotony
--
had
a
certain
pathos
in
them
nevertheless
.
*NL*
Calamities
came
to
_
them
_
too
,
and
their
early
errors
carried
hard
*NL*
consequences
:
perhaps
the
love
of
some
sweet
maiden
,
the
image
of
*NL*
purity
,
order
,
and
calm
,
had
opened
their
eyes
to
the
vision
of
a
life
*NL*
in
which
the
days
would
not
seem
too
long
,
even
without
rioting
;
but
*NL*
the
maiden
was
lost
,
and
the
vision
passed
away
,
and
then
what
was
left
*NL*
to
them
,
especially
when
they
had
become
too
heavy
for
the
hunt
,
or
for
*NL*
carrying
a
gun
over
the
furrows
,
but
to
drink
and
get
merry
,
or
to
*NL*
drink
and
get
angry
,
so
that
they
might
be
independent
of
variety
,
and
*NL*
say
over
again
with
eager
emphasis
the
things
they
had
said
already
any
*NL*
time
that
twelvemonth
?
Assuredly
,
among
these
flushed
and
dull-eyed
men
*NL*
there
were
some
whom
--
thanks
to
their
native
human-kindness
--
even
riot
*NL*
could
never
drive
into
brutality
;
men
who
,
when
their
cheeks
were
*NL*
fresh
,
had
felt
the
keen
point
of
sorrow
or
remorse
,
had
been
pierced
*NL*
by
the
reeds
they
leaned
on
,
or
had
lightly
put
their
limbs
in
fetters
*NL*
from
which
no
struggle
could
loose
them
;
and
under
these
sad
*NL*
circumstances
,
common
to
us
all
,
their
thoughts
could
find
no
*NL*
resting-place
outside
the
ever-trodden
round
of
their
own
petty
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
,
at
least
,
was
the
condition
of
Godfrey
Cass
in
this
*NL*
six-and-twentieth
year
of
his
life
.
A
movement
of
compunction
,
helped
*NL*
by
those
small
indefinable
influences
which
every
personal
relation
*NL*
exerts
on
a
pliant
nature
,
had
urged
him
into
a
secret
marriage
,
which
*NL*
was
a
blight
on
his
life
.
It
was
an
ugly
story
of
low
passion
,
*NL*
delusion
,
and
waking
from
delusion
,
which
needs
not
to
be
dragged
from
*NL*
the
privacy
of
Godfrey
's
bitter
memory
.
He
had
long
known
that
the
*NL*
delusion
was
partly
due
to
a
trap
laid
for
him
by
Dunstan
,
who
saw
in
*NL*
his
brother
's
degrading
marriage
the
means
of
gratifying
at
once
his
*NL*
jealous
hate
and
his
cupidity
.
And
if
Godfrey
could
have
felt
himself
*NL*
simply
a
victim
,
the
iron
bit
that
destiny
had
put
into
his
mouth
would
*NL*
have
chafed
him
less
intolerably
.
If
the
curses
he
muttered
half
aloud
*NL*
when
he
was
alone
had
had
no
other
object
than
Dunstan
's
diabolical
*NL*
cunning
,
he
might
have
shrunk
less
from
the
consequences
of
avowal
.
*NL*
But
he
had
something
else
to
curse
--
his
own
vicious
folly
,
which
now
*NL*
seemed
as
mad
and
unaccountable
to
him
as
almost
all
our
follies
and
*NL*
vices
do
when
their
promptings
have
long
passed
away
.
For
four
years
*NL*
he
had
thought
of
Nancy
Lammeter
,
and
wooed
her
with
tacit
patient
*NL*
worship
,
as
the
woman
who
made
him
think
of
the
future
with
joy
:
she
*NL*
would
be
his
wife
,
and
would
make
home
lovely
to
him
,
as
his
father
's
*NL*
home
had
never
been
;
and
it
would
be
easy
,
when
she
was
always
near
,
to
*NL*
shake
off
those
foolish
habits
that
were
no
pleasures
,
but
only
a
*NL*
feverish
way
of
annulling
vacancy
.
Godfrey
's
was
an
essentially
*NL*
domestic
nature
,
bred
up
in
a
home
where
the
hearth
had
no
smiles
,
and
*NL*
where
the
daily
habits
were
not
chastised
by
the
presence
of
household
*NL*
order
.
His
easy
disposition
made
him
fall
in
unresistingly
with
the
*NL*
family
courses
,
but
the
need
of
some
tender
permanent
affection
,
the
*NL*
longing
for
some
influence
that
would
make
the
good
he
preferred
easy
*NL*
to
pursue
,
caused
the
neatness
,
purity
,
and
liberal
orderliness
of
the
*NL*
Lammeter
household
,
sunned
by
the
smile
of
Nancy
,
to
seem
like
those
*NL*
fresh
bright
hours
of
the
morning
when
temptations
go
to
sleep
and
*NL*
leave
the
ear
open
to
the
voice
of
the
good
angel
,
inviting
to
*NL*
industry
,
sobriety
,
and
peace
.
And
yet
the
hope
of
this
paradise
had
*NL*
not
been
enough
to
save
him
from
a
course
which
shut
him
out
of
it
for
*NL*
ever
.
Instead
of
keeping
fast
hold
of
the
strong
silken
rope
by
which
*NL*
Nancy
would
have
drawn
him
safe
to
the
green
banks
where
it
was
easy
to
*NL*
step
firmly
,
he
had
let
himself
be
dragged
back
into
mud
and
slime
,
in
*NL*
which
it
was
useless
to
struggle
.
He
had
made
ties
for
himself
which
*NL*
robbed
him
of
all
wholesome
motive
,
and
were
a
constant
exasperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
there
was
one
position
worse
than
the
present
:
it
was
the
*NL*
position
he
would
be
in
when
the
ugly
secret
was
disclosed
;
and
the
*NL*
desire
that
continually
triumphed
over
every
other
was
that
of
warding
*NL*
off
the
evil
day
,
when
he
would
have
to
bear
the
consequences
of
his
*NL*
father
's
violent
resentment
for
the
wound
inflicted
on
his
family
*NL*
pride
--
would
have
,
perhaps
,
to
turn
his
back
on
that
hereditary
ease
*NL*
and
dignity
which
,
after
all
,
was
a
sort
of
reason
for
living
,
and
*NL*
would
carry
with
him
the
certainty
that
he
was
banished
for
ever
from
*NL*
the
sight
and
esteem
of
Nancy
Lammeter
.
The
longer
the
interval
,
the
*NL*
more
chance
there
was
of
deliverance
from
some
,
at
least
,
of
the
*NL*
hateful
consequences
to
which
he
had
sold
himself
;
the
more
*NL*
opportunities
remained
for
him
to
snatch
the
strange
gratification
of
*NL*
seeing
Nancy
,
and
gathering
some
faint
indications
of
her
lingering
*NL*
regard
.
Towards
this
gratification
he
was
impelled
,
fitfully
,
every
*NL*
now
and
then
,
after
having
passed
weeks
in
which
he
had
avoided
her
as
*NL*
the
far-off
bright-winged
prize
that
only
made
him
spring
forward
and
*NL*
find
his
chain
all
the
more
galling
.
One
of
those
fits
of
yearning
was
*NL*
on
him
now
,
and
it
would
have
been
strong
enough
to
have
persuaded
him
*NL*
to
trust
Wildfire
to
Dunstan
rather
than
disappoint
the
yearning
,
even
*NL*
if
he
had
not
had
another
reason
for
his
disinclination
towards
the
*NL*
morrow
's
hunt
.
That
other
reason
was
the
fact
that
the
morning
's
meet
*NL*
was
near
Batherley
,
the
market-town
where
the
unhappy
woman
lived
,
*NL*
whose
image
became
more
odious
to
him
every
day
;
and
to
his
thought
the
*NL*
whole
vicinage
was
haunted
by
her
.
The
yoke
a
man
creates
for
himself
*NL*
by
wrong-doing
will
breed
hate
in
the
kindliest
nature
;
and
the
*NL*
good-humoured
,
affectionate-hearted
Godfrey
Cass
was
fast
becoming
a
*NL*
bitter
man
,
visited
by
cruel
wishes
,
that
seemed
to
enter
,
and
depart
,
*NL*
and
enter
again
,
like
demons
who
had
found
in
him
a
ready-garnished
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
he
to
do
this
evening
to
pass
the
time
?
He
might
as
well
go
*NL*
to
the
Rainbow
,
and
hear
the
talk
about
the
cock-fighting
:
everybody
*NL*
was
there
,
and
what
else
was
there
to
be
done
?
Though
,
for
his
own
*NL*
part
,
he
did
not
care
a
button
for
cock-fighting
.
Snuff
,
the
brown
*NL*
spaniel
,
who
had
placed
herself
in
front
of
him
,
and
had
been
watching
*NL*
him
for
some
time
,
now
jumped
up
in
impatience
for
the
expected
caress
.
*NL*
But
Godfrey
thrust
her
away
without
looking
at
her
,
and
left
the
room
,
*NL*
followed
humbly
by
the
unresenting
Snuff
--
perhaps
because
she
saw
no
*NL*
other
career
open
to
her
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Dunstan
Cass
,
setting
off
in
the
raw
morning
,
at
the
judiciously
quiet
*NL*
pace
of
a
man
who
is
obliged
to
ride
to
cover
on
his
hunter
,
had
to
*NL*
take
his
way
along
the
lane
which
,
at
its
farther
extremity
,
passed
by
*NL*
the
piece
of
unenclosed
ground
called
the
Stone-pit
,
where
stood
the
*NL*
cottage
,
once
a
stone-cutter
's
shed
,
now
for
fifteen
years
inhabited
by
*NL*
Silas
Marner
.
The
spot
looked
very
dreary
at
this
season
,
with
the
*NL*
moist
trodden
clay
about
it
,
and
the
red
,
muddy
water
high
up
in
the
*NL*
deserted
quarry
.
That
was
Dunstan
's
first
thought
as
he
approached
it
;
*NL*
the
second
was
,
that
the
old
fool
of
a
weaver
,
whose
loom
he
heard
*NL*
rattling
already
,
had
a
great
deal
of
money
hidden
somewhere
.
How
was
*NL*
it
that
he
,
Dunstan
Cass
,
who
had
often
heard
talk
of
Marner
's
*NL*
miserliness
,
had
never
thought
of
suggesting
to
Godfrey
that
he
should
*NL*
frighten
or
persuade
the
old
fellow
into
lending
the
money
on
the
*NL*
excellent
security
of
the
young
Squire
's
prospects
?
The
resource
*NL*
occurred
to
him
now
as
so
easy
and
agreeable
,
especially
as
Marner
's
*NL*
hoard
was
likely
to
be
large
enough
to
leave
Godfrey
a
handsome
surplus
*NL*
beyond
his
immediate
needs
,
and
enable
him
to
accommodate
his
faithful
*NL*
brother
,
that
he
had
almost
turned
the
horse
's
head
towards
home
again
.
*NL*
Godfrey
would
be
ready
enough
to
accept
the
suggestion
:
he
would
snatch
*NL*
eagerly
at
a
plan
that
might
save
him
from
parting
with
Wildfire
.
But
*NL*
when
Dunstan
's
meditation
reached
this
point
,
the
inclination
to
go
on
*NL*
grew
strong
and
prevailed
.
He
did
n't
want
to
give
Godfrey
that
*NL*
pleasure
:
he
preferred
that
Master
Godfrey
should
be
vexed
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
Dunstan
enjoyed
the
self-important
consciousness
of
having
a
horse
to
*NL*
sell
,
and
the
opportunity
of
driving
a
bargain
,
swaggering
,
and
*NL*
possibly
taking
somebody
in
.
He
might
have
all
the
satisfaction
*NL*
attendant
on
selling
his
brother
's
horse
,
and
not
the
less
have
the
*NL*
further
satisfaction
of
setting
Godfrey
to
borrow
Marner
's
money
.
So
*NL*
he
rode
on
to
cover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bryce
and
Keating
were
there
,
as
Dunstan
was
quite
sure
they
would
*NL*
be
--
he
was
such
a
lucky
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heyday
!
''
said
Bryce
,
who
had
long
had
his
eye
on
Wildfire
,
``
you
're
on
*NL*
your
brother
's
horse
to-day
:
how
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
swopped
with
him
,
''
said
Dunstan
,
whose
delight
in
lying
,
*NL*
grandly
independent
of
utility
,
was
not
to
be
diminished
by
the
*NL*
likelihood
that
his
hearer
would
not
believe
him
--
``
Wildfire
's
mine
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
has
he
swopped
with
you
for
that
big-boned
hack
of
yours
?
''
said
*NL*
Bryce
,
quite
aware
that
he
should
get
another
lie
in
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
was
a
little
account
between
us
,
''
said
Dunsey
,
carelessly
,
*NL*
``
and
Wildfire
made
it
even
.
I
accommodated
him
by
taking
the
horse
,
*NL*
though
it
was
against
my
will
,
for
I
'd
got
an
itch
for
a
mare
o
'
*NL*
Jortin
's
--
as
rare
a
bit
o
'
blood
as
ever
you
threw
your
leg
across
.
*NL*
But
I
shall
keep
Wildfire
,
now
I
've
got
him
,
though
I
'd
a
bid
of
a
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
for
him
the
other
day
,
from
a
man
over
at
*NL*
Flitton
--
he
's
buying
for
Lord
Cromleck
--
a
fellow
with
a
cast
in
his
*NL*
eye
,
and
a
green
waistcoat
.
But
I
mean
to
stick
to
Wildfire
:
I
sha
n't
*NL*
get
a
better
at
a
fence
in
a
hurry
.
The
mare
's
got
more
blood
,
but
*NL*
she
's
a
bit
too
weak
in
the
hind-quarters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bryce
of
course
divined
that
Dunstan
wanted
to
sell
the
horse
,
and
*NL*
Dunstan
knew
that
he
divined
it
-LRB-
horse-dealing
is
only
one
of
many
*NL*
human
transactions
carried
on
in
this
ingenious
manner
-RRB-
;
and
they
both
*NL*
considered
that
the
bargain
was
in
its
first
stage
,
when
Bryce
replied
*NL*
ironically
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
at
that
now
;
I
wonder
you
mean
to
keep
him
;
for
I
never
heard
*NL*
of
a
man
who
did
n't
want
to
sell
his
horse
getting
a
bid
of
half
as
*NL*
much
again
as
the
horse
was
worth
.
You
'll
be
lucky
if
you
get
a
*NL*
hundred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Keating
rode
up
now
,
and
the
transaction
became
more
complicated
.
It
*NL*
ended
in
the
purchase
of
the
horse
by
Bryce
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
,
*NL*
to
be
paid
on
the
delivery
of
Wildfire
,
safe
and
sound
,
at
the
*NL*
Batherley
stables
.
It
did
occur
to
Dunsey
that
it
might
be
wise
for
*NL*
him
to
give
up
the
day
's
hunting
,
proceed
at
once
to
Batherley
,
and
,
*NL*
having
waited
for
Bryce
's
return
,
hire
a
horse
to
carry
him
home
with
*NL*
the
money
in
his
pocket
.
But
the
inclination
for
a
run
,
encouraged
by
*NL*
confidence
in
his
luck
,
and
by
a
draught
of
brandy
from
his
*NL*
pocket-pistol
at
the
conclusion
of
the
bargain
,
was
not
easy
to
*NL*
overcome
,
especially
with
a
horse
under
him
that
would
take
the
fences
*NL*
to
the
admiration
of
the
field
.
Dunstan
,
however
,
took
one
fence
too
*NL*
many
,
and
got
his
horse
pierced
with
a
hedge-stake
.
His
own
*NL*
ill-favoured
person
,
which
was
quite
unmarketable
,
escaped
without
*NL*
injury
;
but
poor
Wildfire
,
unconscious
of
his
price
,
turned
on
his
*NL*
flank
and
painfully
panted
his
last
.
It
happened
that
Dunstan
,
a
short
*NL*
time
before
,
having
had
to
get
down
to
arrange
his
stirrup
,
had
*NL*
muttered
a
good
many
curses
at
this
interruption
,
which
had
thrown
him
*NL*
in
the
rear
of
the
hunt
near
the
moment
of
glory
,
and
under
this
*NL*
exasperation
had
taken
the
fences
more
blindly
.
He
would
soon
have
*NL*
been
up
with
the
hounds
again
,
when
the
fatal
accident
happened
;
and
*NL*
hence
he
was
between
eager
riders
in
advance
,
not
troubling
themselves
*NL*
about
what
happened
behind
them
,
and
far-off
stragglers
,
who
were
as
*NL*
likely
as
not
to
pass
quite
aloof
from
the
line
of
road
in
which
*NL*
Wildfire
had
fallen
.
Dunstan
,
whose
nature
it
was
to
care
more
for
*NL*
immediate
annoyances
than
for
remote
consequences
,
no
sooner
recovered
*NL*
his
legs
,
and
saw
that
it
was
all
over
with
Wildfire
,
than
he
felt
a
*NL*
satisfaction
at
the
absence
of
witnesses
to
a
position
which
no
*NL*
swaggering
could
make
enviable
.
Reinforcing
himself
,
after
his
shake
,
*NL*
with
a
little
brandy
and
much
swearing
,
he
walked
as
fast
as
he
could
*NL*
to
a
coppice
on
his
right
hand
,
through
which
it
occurred
to
him
that
*NL*
he
could
make
his
way
to
Batherley
without
danger
of
encountering
any
*NL*
member
of
the
hunt
.
His
first
intention
was
to
hire
a
horse
there
and
*NL*
ride
home
forthwith
,
for
to
walk
many
miles
without
a
gun
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
and
along
an
ordinary
road
,
was
as
much
out
of
the
question
to
him
as
*NL*
to
other
spirited
young
men
of
his
kind
.
He
did
not
much
mind
about
*NL*
taking
the
bad
news
to
Godfrey
,
for
he
had
to
offer
him
at
the
same
*NL*
time
the
resource
of
Marner
's
money
;
and
if
Godfrey
kicked
,
as
he
*NL*
always
did
,
at
the
notion
of
making
a
fresh
debt
from
which
he
himself
*NL*
got
the
smallest
share
of
advantage
,
why
,
he
would
n't
kick
long
:
*NL*
Dunstan
felt
sure
he
could
worry
Godfrey
into
anything
.
The
idea
of
*NL*
Marner
's
money
kept
growing
in
vividness
,
now
the
want
of
it
had
become
*NL*
immediate
;
the
prospect
of
having
to
make
his
appearance
with
the
muddy
*NL*
boots
of
a
pedestrian
at
Batherley
,
and
to
encounter
the
grinning
*NL*
queries
of
stablemen
,
stood
unpleasantly
in
the
way
of
his
impatience
*NL*
to
be
back
at
Raveloe
and
carry
out
his
felicitous
plan
;
and
a
casual
*NL*
visitation
of
his
waistcoat-pocket
,
as
he
was
ruminating
,
awakened
his
*NL*
memory
to
the
fact
that
the
two
or
three
small
coins
his
forefinger
*NL*
encountered
there
were
of
too
pale
a
colour
to
cover
that
small
debt
,
*NL*
without
payment
of
which
the
stable-keeper
had
declared
he
would
never
*NL*
do
any
more
business
with
Dunsey
Cass
.
After
all
,
according
to
the
*NL*
direction
in
which
the
run
had
brought
him
,
he
was
not
so
very
much
*NL*
farther
from
home
than
he
was
from
Batherley
;
but
Dunsey
,
not
being
*NL*
remarkable
for
clearness
of
head
,
was
only
led
to
this
conclusion
by
*NL*
the
gradual
perception
that
there
were
other
reasons
for
choosing
the
*NL*
unprecedented
course
of
walking
home
.
It
was
now
nearly
four
o'clock
,
*NL*
and
a
mist
was
gathering
:
the
sooner
he
got
into
the
road
the
better
.
*NL*
He
remembered
having
crossed
the
road
and
seen
the
finger-post
only
a
*NL*
little
while
before
Wildfire
broke
down
;
so
,
buttoning
his
coat
,
*NL*
twisting
the
lash
of
his
hunting-whip
compactly
round
the
handle
,
and
*NL*
rapping
the
tops
of
his
boots
with
a
self-possessed
air
,
as
if
to
*NL*
assure
himself
that
he
was
not
at
all
taken
by
surprise
,
he
set
off
*NL*
with
the
sense
that
he
was
undertaking
a
remarkable
feat
of
bodily
*NL*
exertion
,
which
somehow
and
at
some
time
he
should
be
able
to
dress
up
*NL*
and
magnify
to
the
admiration
of
a
select
circle
at
the
Rainbow
.
When
*NL*
a
young
gentleman
like
Dunsey
is
reduced
to
so
exceptional
a
mode
of
*NL*
locomotion
as
walking
,
a
whip
in
his
hand
is
a
desirable
corrective
to
*NL*
a
too
bewildering
dreamy
sense
of
unwontedness
in
his
position
;
and
*NL*
Dunstan
,
as
he
went
along
through
the
gathering
mist
,
was
always
*NL*
rapping
his
whip
somewhere
.
It
was
Godfrey
's
whip
,
which
he
had
chosen
*NL*
to
take
without
leave
because
it
had
a
gold
handle
;
of
course
no
one
*NL*
could
see
,
when
Dunstan
held
it
,
that
the
name
_
Godfrey
Cass
_
was
cut
*NL*
in
deep
letters
on
that
gold
handle
--
they
could
only
see
that
it
was
a
*NL*
very
handsome
whip
.
Dunsey
was
not
without
fear
that
he
might
meet
some
*NL*
acquaintance
in
whose
eyes
he
would
cut
a
pitiable
figure
,
for
mist
is
*NL*
no
screen
when
people
get
close
to
each
other
;
but
when
he
at
last
*NL*
found
himself
in
the
well-known
Raveloe
lanes
without
having
met
a
*NL*
soul
,
he
silently
remarked
that
that
was
part
of
his
usual
good
luck
.
*NL*
But
now
the
mist
,
helped
by
the
evening
darkness
,
was
more
of
a
screen
*NL*
than
he
desired
,
for
it
hid
the
ruts
into
which
his
feet
were
liable
to
*NL*
slip
--
hid
everything
,
so
that
he
had
to
guide
his
steps
by
dragging
his
*NL*
whip
along
the
low
bushes
in
advance
of
the
hedgerow
.
He
must
soon
,
he
*NL*
thought
,
be
getting
near
the
opening
at
the
Stone-pits
:
he
should
find
*NL*
it
out
by
the
break
in
the
hedgerow
.
He
found
it
out
,
however
,
by
*NL*
another
circumstance
which
he
had
not
expected
--
namely
,
by
certain
*NL*
gleams
of
light
,
which
he
presently
guessed
to
proceed
from
Silas
*NL*
Marner
's
cottage
.
That
cottage
and
the
money
hidden
within
it
had
been
*NL*
in
his
mind
continually
during
his
walk
,
and
he
had
been
imagining
ways
*NL*
of
cajoling
and
tempting
the
weaver
to
part
with
the
immediate
*NL*
possession
of
his
money
for
the
sake
of
receiving
interest
.
Dunstan
*NL*
felt
as
if
there
must
be
a
little
frightening
added
to
the
cajolery
,
*NL*
for
his
own
arithmetical
convictions
were
not
clear
enough
to
afford
*NL*
him
any
forcible
demonstration
as
to
the
advantages
of
interest
;
and
as
*NL*
for
security
,
he
regarded
it
vaguely
as
a
means
of
cheating
a
man
by
*NL*
making
him
believe
that
he
would
be
paid
.
Altogether
,
the
operation
on
*NL*
the
miser
's
mind
was
a
task
that
Godfrey
would
be
sure
to
hand
over
to
*NL*
his
more
daring
and
cunning
brother
:
Dunstan
had
made
up
his
mind
to
*NL*
that
;
and
by
the
time
he
saw
the
light
gleaming
through
the
chinks
of
*NL*
Marner
's
shutters
,
the
idea
of
a
dialogue
with
the
weaver
had
become
so
*NL*
familiar
to
him
,
that
it
occurred
to
him
as
quite
a
natural
thing
to
*NL*
make
the
acquaintance
forthwith
.
There
might
be
several
conveniences
*NL*
attending
this
course
:
the
weaver
had
possibly
got
a
lantern
,
and
*NL*
Dunstan
was
tired
of
feeling
his
way
.
He
was
still
nearly
*NL*
three-quarters
of
a
mile
from
home
,
and
the
lane
was
becoming
*NL*
unpleasantly
slippery
,
for
the
mist
was
passing
into
rain
.
He
turned
up
*NL*
the
bank
,
not
without
some
fear
lest
he
might
miss
the
right
way
,
since
*NL*
he
was
not
certain
whether
the
light
were
in
front
or
on
the
side
of
*NL*
the
cottage
.
But
he
felt
the
ground
before
him
cautiously
with
his
*NL*
whip-handle
,
and
at
last
arrived
safely
at
the
door
.
He
knocked
*NL*
loudly
,
rather
enjoying
the
idea
that
the
old
fellow
would
be
*NL*
frightened
at
the
sudden
noise
.
He
heard
no
movement
in
reply
:
all
was
*NL*
silence
in
the
cottage
.
Was
the
weaver
gone
to
bed
,
then
?
If
so
,
why
*NL*
had
he
left
a
light
?
That
was
a
strange
forgetfulness
in
a
miser
.
*NL*
Dunstan
knocked
still
more
loudly
,
and
,
without
pausing
for
a
reply
,
*NL*
pushed
his
fingers
through
the
latch-hole
,
intending
to
shake
the
door
*NL*
and
pull
the
latch-string
up
and
down
,
not
doubting
that
the
door
was
*NL*
fastened
.
But
,
to
his
surprise
,
at
this
double
motion
the
door
opened
,
*NL*
and
he
found
himself
in
front
of
a
bright
fire
which
lit
up
every
*NL*
corner
of
the
cottage
--
the
bed
,
the
loom
,
the
three
chairs
,
and
the
*NL*
table
--
and
showed
him
that
Marner
was
not
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
at
that
moment
could
be
much
more
inviting
to
Dunsey
than
the
*NL*
bright
fire
on
the
brick
hearth
:
he
walked
in
and
seated
himself
by
it
*NL*
at
once
.
There
was
something
in
front
of
the
fire
,
too
,
that
would
*NL*
have
been
inviting
to
a
hungry
man
,
if
it
had
been
in
a
different
stage
*NL*
of
cooking
.
It
was
a
small
bit
of
pork
suspended
from
the
*NL*
kettle-hanger
by
a
string
passed
through
a
large
door-key
,
in
a
way
*NL*
known
to
primitive
housekeepers
unpossessed
of
jacks
.
But
the
pork
had
*NL*
been
hung
at
the
farthest
extremity
of
the
hanger
,
apparently
to
*NL*
prevent
the
roasting
from
proceeding
too
rapidly
during
the
owner
's
*NL*
absence
.
The
old
staring
simpleton
had
hot
meat
for
his
supper
,
then
?
*NL*
thought
Dunstan
.
People
had
always
said
he
lived
on
mouldy
bread
,
on
*NL*
purpose
to
check
his
appetite
.
But
where
could
he
be
at
this
time
,
and
*NL*
on
such
an
evening
,
leaving
his
supper
in
this
stage
of
preparation
,
*NL*
and
his
door
unfastened
?
Dunstan
's
own
recent
difficulty
in
making
his
*NL*
way
suggested
to
him
that
the
weaver
had
perhaps
gone
outside
his
*NL*
cottage
to
fetch
in
fuel
,
or
for
some
such
brief
purpose
,
and
had
*NL*
slipped
into
the
Stone-pit
.
That
was
an
interesting
idea
to
Dunstan
,
*NL*
carrying
consequences
of
entire
novelty
.
If
the
weaver
was
dead
,
who
*NL*
had
a
right
to
his
money
?
Who
would
know
where
his
money
was
hidden
?
*NL*
_
Who
would
know
that
anybody
had
come
to
take
it
away
?
_
He
went
no
*NL*
farther
into
the
subtleties
of
evidence
:
the
pressing
question
,
``
Where
*NL*
_
is
_
the
money
?
''
now
took
such
entire
possession
of
him
as
to
make
him
*NL*
quite
forget
that
the
weaver
's
death
was
not
a
certainty
.
A
dull
mind
,
*NL*
once
arriving
at
an
inference
that
flatters
a
desire
,
is
rarely
able
to
*NL*
retain
the
impression
that
the
notion
from
which
the
inference
started
*NL*
was
purely
problematic
.
And
Dunstan
's
mind
was
as
dull
as
the
mind
of
*NL*
a
possible
felon
usually
is
.
There
were
only
three
hiding-places
where
*NL*
he
had
ever
heard
of
cottagers
'
hoards
being
found
:
the
thatch
,
the
*NL*
bed
,
and
a
hole
in
the
floor
.
Marner
's
cottage
had
no
thatch
;
and
*NL*
Dunstan
's
first
act
,
after
a
train
of
thought
made
rapid
by
the
*NL*
stimulus
of
cupidity
,
was
to
go
up
to
the
bed
;
but
while
he
did
so
,
his
*NL*
eyes
travelled
eagerly
over
the
floor
,
where
the
bricks
,
distinct
in
*NL*
the
fire-light
,
were
discernible
under
the
sprinkling
of
sand
.
But
not
*NL*
everywhere
;
for
there
was
one
spot
,
and
one
only
,
which
was
quite
*NL*
covered
with
sand
,
and
sand
showing
the
marks
of
fingers
,
which
had
*NL*
apparently
been
careful
to
spread
it
over
a
given
space
.
It
was
near
*NL*
the
treddles
of
the
loom
.
In
an
instant
Dunstan
darted
to
that
spot
,
*NL*
swept
away
the
sand
with
his
whip
,
and
,
inserting
the
thin
end
of
the
*NL*
hook
between
the
bricks
,
found
that
they
were
loose
.
In
haste
he
*NL*
lifted
up
two
bricks
,
and
saw
what
he
had
no
doubt
was
the
object
of
*NL*
his
search
;
for
what
could
there
be
but
money
in
those
two
leathern
*NL*
bags
?
And
,
from
their
weight
,
they
must
be
filled
with
guineas
.
*NL*
Dunstan
felt
round
the
hole
,
to
be
certain
that
it
held
no
more
;
then
*NL*
hastily
replaced
the
bricks
,
and
spread
the
sand
over
them
.
Hardly
*NL*
more
than
five
minutes
had
passed
since
he
entered
the
cottage
,
but
it
*NL*
seemed
to
Dunstan
like
a
long
while
;
and
though
he
was
without
any
*NL*
distinct
recognition
of
the
possibility
that
Marner
might
be
alive
,
and
*NL*
might
re-enter
the
cottage
at
any
moment
,
he
felt
an
undefinable
dread
*NL*
laying
hold
on
him
,
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
the
bags
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
He
would
hasten
out
into
the
darkness
,
and
then
consider
what
he
should
*NL*
do
with
the
bags
.
He
closed
the
door
behind
him
immediately
,
that
he
*NL*
might
shut
in
the
stream
of
light
:
a
few
steps
would
be
enough
to
carry
*NL*
him
beyond
betrayal
by
the
gleams
from
the
shutter-chinks
and
the
*NL*
latch-hole
.
The
rain
and
darkness
had
got
thicker
,
and
he
was
glad
of
*NL*
it
;
though
it
was
awkward
walking
with
both
hands
filled
,
so
that
it
*NL*
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
grasp
his
whip
along
with
one
of
the
*NL*
bags
.
But
when
he
had
gone
a
yard
or
two
,
he
might
take
his
time
.
So
*NL*
he
stepped
forward
into
the
darkness
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dunstan
Cass
turned
his
back
on
the
cottage
,
Silas
Marner
was
not
*NL*
more
than
a
hundred
yards
away
from
it
,
plodding
along
from
the
village
*NL*
with
a
sack
thrown
round
his
shoulders
as
an
overcoat
,
and
with
a
horn
*NL*
lantern
in
his
hand
.
His
legs
were
weary
,
but
his
mind
was
at
ease
,
*NL*
free
from
the
presentiment
of
change
.
The
sense
of
security
more
*NL*
frequently
springs
from
habit
than
from
conviction
,
and
for
this
reason
*NL*
it
often
subsists
after
such
a
change
in
the
conditions
as
might
have
*NL*
been
expected
to
suggest
alarm
.
The
lapse
of
time
during
which
a
given
*NL*
event
has
not
happened
,
is
,
in
this
logic
of
habit
,
constantly
alleged
*NL*
as
a
reason
why
the
event
should
never
happen
,
even
when
the
lapse
of
*NL*
time
is
precisely
the
added
condition
which
makes
the
event
imminent
.
*NL*
A
man
will
tell
you
that
he
has
worked
in
a
mine
for
forty
years
unhurt
*NL*
by
an
accident
as
a
reason
why
he
should
apprehend
no
danger
,
though
*NL*
the
roof
is
beginning
to
sink
;
and
it
is
often
observable
,
that
the
*NL*
older
a
man
gets
,
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
him
to
retain
a
believing
*NL*
conception
of
his
own
death
.
This
influence
of
habit
was
necessarily
*NL*
strong
in
a
man
whose
life
was
so
monotonous
as
Marner
's
--
who
saw
no
*NL*
new
people
and
heard
of
no
new
events
to
keep
alive
in
him
the
idea
of
*NL*
the
unexpected
and
the
changeful
;
and
it
explains
simply
enough
,
why
*NL*
his
mind
could
be
at
ease
,
though
he
had
left
his
house
and
his
*NL*
treasure
more
defenceless
than
usual
.
Silas
was
thinking
with
double
*NL*
complacency
of
his
supper
:
first
,
because
it
would
be
hot
and
savoury
;
*NL*
and
secondly
,
because
it
would
cost
him
nothing
.
For
the
little
bit
of
*NL*
pork
was
a
present
from
that
excellent
housewife
,
Miss
Priscilla
*NL*
Lammeter
,
to
whom
he
had
this
day
carried
home
a
handsome
piece
of
*NL*
linen
;
and
it
was
only
on
occasion
of
a
present
like
this
,
that
Silas
*NL*
indulged
himself
with
roast-meat
.
Supper
was
his
favourite
meal
,
*NL*
because
it
came
at
his
time
of
revelry
,
when
his
heart
warmed
over
his
*NL*
gold
;
whenever
he
had
roast-meat
,
he
always
chose
to
have
it
for
*NL*
supper
.
But
this
evening
,
he
had
no
sooner
ingeniously
knotted
his
*NL*
string
fast
round
his
bit
of
pork
,
twisted
the
string
according
to
rule
*NL*
over
his
door-key
,
passed
it
through
the
handle
,
and
made
it
fast
on
*NL*
the
hanger
,
than
he
remembered
that
a
piece
of
very
fine
twine
was
*NL*
indispensable
to
his
``
setting
up
''
a
new
piece
of
work
in
his
loom
early
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
It
had
slipped
his
memory
,
because
,
in
coming
from
Mr.
*NL*
Lammeter
's
,
he
had
not
had
to
pass
through
the
village
;
but
to
lose
*NL*
time
by
going
on
errands
in
the
morning
was
out
of
the
question
.
It
*NL*
was
a
nasty
fog
to
turn
out
into
,
but
there
were
things
Silas
loved
*NL*
better
than
his
own
comfort
;
so
,
drawing
his
pork
to
the
extremity
of
*NL*
the
hanger
,
and
arming
himself
with
his
lantern
and
his
old
sack
,
he
*NL*
set
out
on
what
,
in
ordinary
weather
,
would
have
been
a
twenty
minutes
'
*NL*
errand
.
He
could
not
have
locked
his
door
without
undoing
his
*NL*
well-knotted
string
and
retarding
his
supper
;
it
was
not
worth
his
*NL*
while
to
make
that
sacrifice
.
What
thief
would
find
his
way
to
the
*NL*
Stone-pits
on
such
a
night
as
this
?
and
why
should
he
come
on
this
*NL*
particular
night
,
when
he
had
never
come
through
all
the
fifteen
years
*NL*
before
?
These
questions
were
not
distinctly
present
in
Silas
's
mind
;
*NL*
they
merely
serve
to
represent
the
vaguely-felt
foundation
of
his
*NL*
freedom
from
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
his
door
in
much
satisfaction
that
his
errand
was
done
:
he
*NL*
opened
it
,
and
to
his
short-sighted
eyes
everything
remained
as
he
had
*NL*
left
it
,
except
that
the
fire
sent
out
a
welcome
increase
of
heat
.
He
*NL*
trod
about
the
floor
while
putting
by
his
lantern
and
throwing
aside
*NL*
his
hat
and
sack
,
so
as
to
merge
the
marks
of
Dunstan
's
feet
on
the
*NL*
sand
in
the
marks
of
his
own
nailed
boots
.
Then
he
moved
his
pork
*NL*
nearer
to
the
fire
,
and
sat
down
to
the
agreeable
business
of
tending
*NL*
the
meat
and
warming
himself
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
who
had
looked
at
him
as
the
red
light
shone
upon
his
pale
*NL*
face
,
strange
straining
eyes
,
and
meagre
form
,
would
perhaps
have
*NL*
understood
the
mixture
of
contemptuous
pity
,
dread
,
and
suspicion
with
*NL*
which
he
was
regarded
by
his
neighbours
in
Raveloe
.
Yet
few
men
could
*NL*
be
more
harmless
than
poor
Marner
.
In
his
truthful
simple
soul
,
not
*NL*
even
the
growing
greed
and
worship
of
gold
could
beget
any
vice
*NL*
directly
injurious
to
others
.
The
light
of
his
faith
quite
put
out
,
*NL*
and
his
affections
made
desolate
,
he
had
clung
with
all
the
force
of
*NL*
his
nature
to
his
work
and
his
money
;
and
like
all
objects
to
which
a
*NL*
man
devotes
himself
,
they
had
fashioned
him
into
correspondence
with
*NL*
themselves
.
His
loom
,
as
he
wrought
in
it
without
ceasing
,
had
in
its
*NL*
turn
wrought
on
him
,
and
confirmed
more
and
more
the
monotonous
craving
*NL*
for
its
monotonous
response
.
His
gold
,
as
he
hung
over
it
and
saw
it
*NL*
grow
,
gathered
his
power
of
loving
together
into
a
hard
isolation
like
*NL*
its
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
was
warm
he
began
to
think
it
would
be
a
long
while
to
*NL*
wait
till
after
supper
before
he
drew
out
his
guineas
,
and
it
would
be
*NL*
pleasant
to
see
them
on
the
table
before
him
as
he
ate
his
unwonted
*NL*
feast
.
For
joy
is
the
best
of
wine
,
and
Silas
's
guineas
were
a
golden
*NL*
wine
of
that
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
and
placed
his
candle
unsuspectingly
on
the
floor
near
his
*NL*
loom
,
swept
away
the
sand
without
noticing
any
change
,
and
removed
the
*NL*
bricks
.
The
sight
of
the
empty
hole
made
his
heart
leap
violently
,
but
*NL*
the
belief
that
his
gold
was
gone
could
not
come
at
once
--
only
terror
,
*NL*
and
the
eager
effort
to
put
an
end
to
the
terror
.
He
passed
his
*NL*
trembling
hand
all
about
the
hole
,
trying
to
think
it
possible
that
his
*NL*
eyes
had
deceived
him
;
then
he
held
the
candle
in
the
hole
and
examined
*NL*
it
curiously
,
trembling
more
and
more
.
At
last
he
shook
so
violently
*NL*
that
he
let
fall
the
candle
,
and
lifted
his
hands
to
his
head
,
trying
*NL*
to
steady
himself
,
that
he
might
think
.
Had
he
put
his
gold
somewhere
*NL*
else
,
by
a
sudden
resolution
last
night
,
and
then
forgotten
it
?
A
man
*NL*
falling
into
dark
waters
seeks
a
momentary
footing
even
on
sliding
*NL*
stones
;
and
Silas
,
by
acting
as
if
he
believed
in
false
hopes
,
warded
*NL*
off
the
moment
of
despair
.
He
searched
in
every
corner
,
he
turned
his
*NL*
bed
over
,
and
shook
it
,
and
kneaded
it
;
he
looked
in
his
brick
oven
*NL*
where
he
laid
his
sticks
.
When
there
was
no
other
place
to
be
*NL*
searched
,
he
kneeled
down
again
and
felt
once
more
all
round
the
hole
.
*NL*
There
was
no
untried
refuge
left
for
a
moment
's
shelter
from
the
*NL*
terrible
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
there
was
a
sort
of
refuge
which
always
comes
with
the
prostration
*NL*
of
thought
under
an
overpowering
passion
:
it
was
that
expectation
of
*NL*
impossibilities
,
that
belief
in
contradictory
images
,
which
is
still
*NL*
distinct
from
madness
,
because
it
is
capable
of
being
dissipated
by
the
*NL*
external
fact
.
Silas
got
up
from
his
knees
trembling
,
and
looked
round
*NL*
at
the
table
:
did
n't
the
gold
lie
there
after
all
?
The
table
was
bare
.
*NL*
Then
he
turned
and
looked
behind
him
--
looked
all
round
his
dwelling
,
*NL*
seeming
to
strain
his
brown
eyes
after
some
possible
appearance
of
the
*NL*
bags
where
he
had
already
sought
them
in
vain
.
He
could
see
every
*NL*
object
in
his
cottage
--
and
his
gold
was
not
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
put
his
trembling
hands
to
his
head
,
and
gave
a
wild
ringing
*NL*
scream
,
the
cry
of
desolation
.
For
a
few
moments
after
,
he
stood
*NL*
motionless
;
but
the
cry
had
relieved
him
from
the
first
maddening
*NL*
pressure
of
the
truth
.
He
turned
,
and
tottered
towards
his
loom
,
and
*NL*
got
into
the
seat
where
he
worked
,
instinctively
seeking
this
as
the
*NL*
strongest
assurance
of
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
that
all
the
false
hopes
had
vanished
,
and
the
first
shock
of
*NL*
certainty
was
past
,
the
idea
of
a
thief
began
to
present
itself
,
and
he
*NL*
entertained
it
eagerly
,
because
a
thief
might
be
caught
and
made
to
*NL*
restore
the
gold
.
The
thought
brought
some
new
strength
with
it
,
and
*NL*
he
started
from
his
loom
to
the
door
.
As
he
opened
it
the
rain
beat
in
*NL*
upon
him
,
for
it
was
falling
more
and
more
heavily
.
There
were
no
*NL*
footsteps
to
be
tracked
on
such
a
night
--
footsteps
?
When
had
the
thief
*NL*
come
?
During
Silas
's
absence
in
the
daytime
the
door
had
been
locked
,
*NL*
and
there
had
been
no
marks
of
any
inroad
on
his
return
by
daylight
.
*NL*
And
in
the
evening
,
too
,
he
said
to
himself
,
everything
was
the
same
as
*NL*
when
he
had
left
it
.
The
sand
and
bricks
looked
as
if
they
had
not
*NL*
been
moved
.
_
Was
_
it
a
thief
who
had
taken
the
bags
?
or
was
it
a
*NL*
cruel
power
that
no
hands
could
reach
,
which
had
delighted
in
making
*NL*
him
a
second
time
desolate
?
He
shrank
from
this
vaguer
dread
,
and
*NL*
fixed
his
mind
with
struggling
effort
on
the
robber
with
hands
,
who
*NL*
could
be
reached
by
hands
.
His
thoughts
glanced
at
all
the
neighbours
*NL*
who
had
made
any
remarks
,
or
asked
any
questions
which
he
might
now
*NL*
regard
as
a
ground
of
suspicion
.
There
was
Jem
Rodney
,
a
known
*NL*
poacher
,
and
otherwise
disreputable
:
he
had
often
met
Marner
in
his
*NL*
journeys
across
the
fields
,
and
had
said
something
jestingly
about
the
*NL*
weaver
's
money
;
nay
,
he
had
once
irritated
Marner
,
by
lingering
at
the
*NL*
fire
when
he
called
to
light
his
pipe
,
instead
of
going
about
his
*NL*
business
.
Jem
Rodney
was
the
man
--
there
was
ease
in
the
thought
.
Jem
*NL*
could
be
found
and
made
to
restore
the
money
:
Marner
did
not
want
to
*NL*
punish
him
,
but
only
to
get
back
his
gold
which
had
gone
from
him
,
and
*NL*
left
his
soul
like
a
forlorn
traveller
on
an
unknown
desert
.
The
*NL*
robber
must
be
laid
hold
of
.
Marner
's
ideas
of
legal
authority
were
*NL*
confused
,
but
he
felt
that
he
must
go
and
proclaim
his
loss
;
and
the
*NL*
great
people
in
the
village
--
the
clergyman
,
the
constable
,
and
Squire
*NL*
Cass
--
would
make
Jem
Rodney
,
or
somebody
else
,
deliver
up
the
stolen
*NL*
money
.
He
rushed
out
in
the
rain
,
under
the
stimulus
of
this
hope
,
*NL*
forgetting
to
cover
his
head
,
not
caring
to
fasten
his
door
;
for
he
*NL*
felt
as
if
he
had
nothing
left
to
lose
.
He
ran
swiftly
,
till
want
of
*NL*
breath
compelled
him
to
slacken
his
pace
as
he
was
entering
the
village
*NL*
at
the
turning
close
to
the
Rainbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rainbow
,
in
Marner
's
view
,
was
a
place
of
luxurious
resort
for
rich
*NL*
and
stout
husbands
,
whose
wives
had
superfluous
stores
of
linen
;
it
was
*NL*
the
place
where
he
was
likely
to
find
the
powers
and
dignities
of
*NL*
Raveloe
,
and
where
he
could
most
speedily
make
his
loss
public
.
He
*NL*
lifted
the
latch
,
and
turned
into
the
bright
bar
or
kitchen
on
the
*NL*
right
hand
,
where
the
less
lofty
customers
of
the
house
were
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
assembling
,
the
parlour
on
the
left
being
reserved
for
the
*NL*
more
select
society
in
which
Squire
Cass
frequently
enjoyed
the
double
*NL*
pleasure
of
conviviality
and
condescension
.
But
the
parlour
was
dark
*NL*
to-night
,
the
chief
personages
who
ornamented
its
circle
being
all
at
*NL*
Mrs.
Osgood
's
birthday
dance
,
as
Godfrey
Cass
was
.
And
in
consequence
*NL*
of
this
,
the
party
on
the
high-screened
seats
in
the
kitchen
was
more
*NL*
numerous
than
usual
;
several
personages
,
who
would
otherwise
have
been
*NL*
admitted
into
the
parlour
and
enlarged
the
opportunity
of
hectoring
and
*NL*
condescension
for
their
betters
,
being
content
this
evening
to
vary
*NL*
their
enjoyment
by
taking
their
spirits-and-water
where
they
could
*NL*
themselves
hector
and
condescend
in
company
that
called
for
beer
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
,
which
was
at
a
high
pitch
of
animation
when
Silas
*NL*
approached
the
door
of
the
Rainbow
,
had
,
as
usual
,
been
slow
and
*NL*
intermittent
when
the
company
first
assembled
.
The
pipes
began
to
be
*NL*
puffed
in
a
silence
which
had
an
air
of
severity
;
the
more
important
*NL*
customers
,
who
drank
spirits
and
sat
nearest
the
fire
,
staring
at
each
*NL*
other
as
if
a
bet
were
depending
on
the
first
man
who
winked
;
while
the
*NL*
beer-drinkers
,
chiefly
men
in
fustian
jackets
and
smock-frocks
,
kept
*NL*
their
eyelids
down
and
rubbed
their
hands
across
their
mouths
,
as
if
*NL*
their
draughts
of
beer
were
a
funereal
duty
attended
with
embarrassing
*NL*
sadness
.
At
last
Mr.
Snell
,
the
landlord
,
a
man
of
a
neutral
*NL*
disposition
,
accustomed
to
stand
aloof
from
human
differences
as
those
*NL*
of
beings
who
were
all
alike
in
need
of
liquor
,
broke
silence
,
by
*NL*
saying
in
a
doubtful
tone
to
his
cousin
the
butcher
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
folks
`
ud
say
that
was
a
fine
beast
you
druv
in
yesterday
,
Bob
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
butcher
,
a
jolly
,
smiling
,
red-haired
man
,
was
not
disposed
to
*NL*
answer
rashly
.
He
gave
a
few
puffs
before
he
spat
and
replied
,
``
And
*NL*
they
would
n't
be
fur
wrong
,
John
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
feeble
delusive
thaw
,
the
silence
set
in
as
severely
as
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
a
red
Durham
?
''
said
the
farrier
,
taking
up
the
thread
of
*NL*
discourse
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farrier
looked
at
the
landlord
,
and
the
landlord
looked
at
the
*NL*
butcher
,
as
the
person
who
must
take
the
responsibility
of
answering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Red
it
was
,
''
said
the
butcher
,
in
his
good-humoured
husky
treble
--
``
and
*NL*
a
Durham
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
need
n't
tell
_
me
_
who
you
bought
it
of
,
''
said
the
farrier
,
*NL*
looking
round
with
some
triumph
;
``
I
know
who
it
is
has
got
the
red
*NL*
Durhams
o
'
this
country-side
.
And
she
'd
a
white
star
on
her
brow
,
I
'll
*NL*
bet
a
penny
?
''
The
farrier
leaned
forward
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
*NL*
as
he
put
this
question
,
and
his
eyes
twinkled
knowingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
;
yes
--
she
might
,
''
said
the
butcher
,
slowly
,
considering
that
he
*NL*
was
giving
a
decided
affirmative
.
``
I
do
n't
say
contrairy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
that
very
well
,
''
said
the
farrier
,
throwing
himself
backward
*NL*
again
,
and
speaking
defiantly
;
``
if
_
I
_
do
n't
know
Mr.
Lammeter
's
cows
,
*NL*
I
should
like
to
know
who
does
--
that
's
all
.
And
as
for
the
cow
you
've
*NL*
bought
,
bargain
or
no
bargain
,
I
've
been
at
the
drenching
of
*NL*
her
--
contradick
me
who
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
farrier
looked
fierce
,
and
the
mild
butcher
's
conversational
spirit
*NL*
was
roused
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
for
contradicking
no
man
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
'm
for
peace
and
*NL*
quietness
.
Some
are
for
cutting
long
ribs
--
I
'm
for
cutting
'em
short
*NL*
myself
;
but
_
I
_
do
n't
quarrel
with
'em
.
All
I
say
is
,
it
's
a
lovely
*NL*
carkiss
--
and
anybody
as
was
reasonable
,
it
`
ud
bring
tears
into
their
*NL*
eyes
to
look
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
the
cow
as
I
drenched
,
whatever
it
is
,
''
pursued
the
*NL*
farrier
,
angrily
;
``
and
it
was
Mr.
Lammeter
's
cow
,
else
you
told
a
lie
*NL*
when
you
said
it
was
a
red
Durham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
no
lies
,
''
said
the
butcher
,
with
the
same
mild
huskiness
as
*NL*
before
,
``
and
I
contradick
none
--
not
if
a
man
was
to
swear
himself
*NL*
black
:
he
's
no
meat
o
'
mine
,
nor
none
o
'
my
bargains
.
All
I
say
is
,
*NL*
it
's
a
lovely
carkiss
.
And
what
I
say
,
I
'll
stick
to
;
but
I
'll
quarrel
*NL*
wi
'
no
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
farrier
,
with
bitter
sarcasm
,
looking
at
the
company
*NL*
generally
;
``
and
p
`
rhaps
you
are
n't
pig-headed
;
and
p
`
rhaps
you
did
n't
*NL*
say
the
cow
was
a
red
Durham
;
and
p
`
rhaps
you
did
n't
say
she
'd
got
a
*NL*
star
on
her
brow

stick
to
that
,
now
you
're
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
''
said
the
landlord
;
``
let
the
cow
alone
.
The
truth
lies
*NL*
atween
you
:
you
're
both
right
and
both
wrong

as
I
allays
say
.
And
as
*NL*
for
the
cow
's
being
Mr.
Lammeter
's
,
I
say
nothing
to
that
;
but
this
I
*NL*
say
,
as

's
the
Rainbow

matter

*NL*
Mr.
Macey
?
You
remember
when
first

Lammeter
's
father

into
*NL*
these
parts
,
and
took
the
Warrens
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Macey
,
tailor
and
parish-clerk
,
the
latter
of
which
functions
*NL*
rheumatism
had
of
late
obliged
him
to
share
with
a
small-featured
young
*NL*
man
who
sat
opposite
him
,
held
his
white
head
on
one
side
,
and
twirled
*NL*
his
thumbs
with
an
air
of
complacency
,
slightly
seasoned
with
*NL*
criticism
.
He
smiled
pityingly
,
in
answer
to
the
landlord
's
appeal
,
*NL*
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

aye

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

're
pointing
at

said
the
deputy
clerk

with
an

air
of
anxious
propriety
,
``
I

said
a
large
*NL*
jocose-looking
man
,
an
excellent
wheelwright
in
his
week-day
capacity
,
*NL*
but
on
Sundays
leader
of
the
choir
.
He
winked
,
as
he
spoke
,
at
two
of
*NL*
the
company
,
who
were
known
officially
as
the
``
bassoon
''
and
the
*NL*
``
key-bugle
''
,
in
the
confidence
that
he
was
expressing
the
sense
of
the
*NL*
musical
profession
in
Raveloe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tookey
,
the
deputy-clerk
,
who
shared
the
unpopularity
common
to
*NL*
deputies
,
turned
very
red
,

replied
,
with
careful
moderation

``
Mr.

people
set
up

for

a
standard

There

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

felt
very
well

attack
on
youthful
presumption

``

said
poor
Tookey

serious
amidst
the
general

laughter

unfitting

``

This
kind
of
unflinching
frankness
was
the
most
piquant
form
of
joke
to
*NL*
the
company
at
the
Rainbow
,

Ben

insult
was
felt
by

see
what
it
is
plain
enough
,
''
said
Mr.
Tookey
,
unable
to
keep
cool
*NL*
any
longer
.
``
There
's
a
consperacy
to
turn
me
out
o
'
the
choir
,
as
I
*NL*
should
n't
share
the
Christmas
money
--
that
's
where
it
is
.
But
I
shall
*NL*
speak
to
Mr.
Crackenthorp
;
I
'll
not
be
put
upon
by
no
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
Tookey
,
''
said
Ben
Winthrop
.
``
We
'll
pay
you
your
share
to
*NL*
keep
out
of
it
--
that
's
what
we
'll
do

There
's
things
folks
`
ud
pay
to
*NL*
be
rid
on
,
besides
varmin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
who
felt
that
paying
people
for
their
*NL*
absence
was
a
principle
dangerous
to
society
;
``
a
joke
's
a
joke
.
We
're
*NL*
all
good
friends
here
,
I
hope
.
We
must
give
and
take
.
You
're
both
*NL*
right
and
you
're
both
wrong
,
as
I
say
.
I
agree
wi
'
Mr.
Macey
here
,
as
*NL*
there
's
two
opinions
;
and
if
mine
was
asked
,
I
should
say
they
're
both
*NL*
right
.
Tookey
's
right
and
Winthrop
's
right
,
and
they
've
only
got
to
*NL*
split
the
difference
and
make
themselves
even
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
farrier
was
puffing
his
pipe
rather
fiercely
,
in
some
contempt
at
*NL*
this
trivial
discussion
.
He
had
no
ear
for
music
himself
,
and
never
*NL*
went
to
church
,
as
being
of
the
medical
profession
,
and
likely
to
be
in
*NL*
requisition
for
delicate
cows
.
But
the
butcher
,
having
music
in
his
*NL*
soul
,
had
listened
with
a
divided
desire
for
Tookey
's
defeat
and
for
*NL*
the
preservation
of
the
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
he
said
,
following
up
the
landlord
's
conciliatory
view
,
*NL*
``
we
're
fond
of
our
old
clerk
;
it
's
nat
`
ral
,
and
him
used
to
be
such
a
*NL*
singer
,
and
got
a
brother
as
is
known
for
the
first
fiddler
in
this
*NL*
country-side
.
Eh
,
it
's
a
pity
but
what
Solomon
lived
in
our
village
,
*NL*
and
could
give
us
a
tune
when
we
liked
;
eh
,
Mr.
Macey
?
I
'd
keep
him
in
*NL*
liver
and
lights
for
nothing
--
that
I
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
said
Mr.
Macey
,
in
the
height
of
complacency
;
``
our
family
's
*NL*
been
known
for
musicianers
as
far
back
as
anybody
can
tell
.
But
them
*NL*
things
are
dying
out
,
as
I
tell
Solomon
every
time
he
comes
round
;
*NL*
there
's
no
voices
like
what
there
used
to
be
,
and
there
's
nobody
*NL*
remembers
what
we
remember
,
if
it
is
n't
the
old
crows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
you
remember
when
first
Mr.
Lammeter
's
father
come
into
these
*NL*
parts
,
do
n't
you
,
Mr.
Macey
?
''
said
the
landlord
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
I
did
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
who
had
now
gone
through
that
*NL*
complimentary
process
necessary
to
bring
him
up
to
the
point
of
*NL*
narration
;
``
and
a
fine
old
gentleman
he
was
--
as
fine
,
and
finer
nor
the
*NL*
Mr.
Lammeter
as
now
is
.
He
came
from
a
bit
north
`
ard
,
so
far
as
I
*NL*
could
ever
make
out
.
But
there
's
nobody
rightly
knows
about
those
*NL*
parts
:
only
it
could
n't
be
far
north
`
ard
,
nor
much
different
from
this
*NL*
country
,
for
he
brought
a
fine
breed
o
'
sheep
with
him
,
so
there
must
*NL*
be
pastures
there
,
and
everything
reasonable
.
We
heared
tell
as
he
'd
*NL*
sold
his
own
land
to
come
and
take
the
Warrens
,
and
that
seemed
odd
for
*NL*
a
man
as
had
land
of
his
own
,
to
come
and
rent
a
farm
in
a
strange
*NL*
place
.
But
they
said
it
was
along
of
his
wife
's
dying
;
though
there
's
*NL*
reasons
in
things
as
nobody
knows
on
--
that
's
pretty
much
what
I
've
made
*NL*
out
;
yet
some
folks
are
so
wise
,
they
'll
find
you
fifty
reasons
*NL*
straight
off
,
and
all
the
while
the
real
reason
's
winking
at
'em
in
the
*NL*
corner
,
and
they
niver
see
`
t.
Howsomever
,
it
was
soon
seen
as
we
'd
got
*NL*
a
new
parish
`
ner
as
know
'd
the
rights
and
customs
o
'
things
,
and
kep
a
*NL*
good
house
,
and
was
well
looked
on
by
everybody
.
And
the
young
*NL*
man
--
that
's
the
Mr.
Lammeter
as
now
is
,
for
he
'd
niver
a
sister
--
soon
*NL*
begun
to
court
Miss
Osgood
,
that
's
the
sister
o
'
the
Mr.
Osgood
as
now
*NL*
is
,
and
a
fine
handsome
lass
she
was
--
eh
,
you
ca
n't
think
--
they
pretend
*NL*
this
young
lass
is
like
her
,
but
that
's
the
way
wi
'
people
as
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
come
before
'em
.
_
I
_
should
know
,
for
I
helped
the
old
*NL*
rector
,
Mr.
Drumlow
as
was
,
I
helped
him
marry
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mr.
Macey
paused
;
he
always
gave
his
narrative
in
instalments
,
*NL*
expecting
to
be
questioned
according
to
precedent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
and
a
partic
`
lar
thing
happened
,
did
n't
it
,
Mr.
Macey
,
so
as
you
*NL*
were
likely
to
remember
that
marriage
?
''
said
the
landlord
,
in
a
*NL*
congratulatory
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
there
did
--
a
_
very
_
partic

lar
thing
,
''
said
Mr.
Macey
,
*NL*
nodding
sideways
.
``
For
Mr.
Drumlow
--
poor
old
gentleman
,
I
was
fond
on
*NL*
him
,
though
he
'd
got
a
bit
confused
in
his
head
,
what
wi
'
age
and
wi
'
*NL*
taking
a
drop
o
'
summat
warm
when
the
service
come
of
a
cold
morning
.
*NL*
And
young
Mr.
Lammeter
,
he
'd
have
no
way
but
he
must
be
married
in
*NL*
Janiwary
,
which
,
to
be
sure
,
's
a
unreasonable
time
to
be
married
in
,
*NL*
for
it
is
n't
like
a
christening
or
a
burying
,
as
you
ca
n't
help
;
and
so
*NL*
Mr.
Drumlow
--
poor
old
gentleman
,
I
was
fond
on
him
--
but
when
he
come
to
*NL*
put
the
questions
,
he
put
'em
by
the
rule
o
'
contrairy
,
like
,
and
he
*NL*
says
,
``
Wilt
thou
have
this
man
to
thy
wedded
wife
?
''
says
he
,
and
then
*NL*
he
says
,
``
Wilt
thou
have
this
woman
to
thy
wedded
husband
?
''
says
he
.
*NL*
But
the
partic
`
larest
thing
of
all
is
,
as
nobody
took
any
notice
on
it
*NL*
but
me
,
and
they
answered
straight
off
``
yes
''
,
like
as
if
it
had
been
me
*NL*
saying
``
Amen
''
i
'
the
right
place
,
without
listening
to
what
went
*NL*
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
_
you
_
knew
what
was
going
on
well
enough
,
did
n't
you
,
Mr.
Macey
?
*NL*
You
were
live
enough
,
eh
?
''
said
the
butcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lor
bless
you
!
''
said
Mr.
Macey
,
pausing
,
and
smiling
in
pity
at
the
*NL*
impotence
of
his
hearer
's
imagination
--
``
why
,
I
was
all
of
a
tremble
:
it
*NL*
was
as
if
I
'd
been
a
coat
pulled
by
the
two
tails
,
like
;
for
I
could
n't
*NL*
stop
the
parson
,
I
could
n't
take
upon
me
to
do
that
;
and
yet
I
said
to
*NL*
myself
,
I
says
,
``
Suppose
they
should
n't
be
fast
married
,
'cause
the
*NL*
words
are
contrairy
?
''
and
my
head
went
working
like
a
mill
,
for
I
was
*NL*
allays
uncommon
for
turning
things
over
and
seeing
all
round
'em
;
and
I
*NL*
says
to
myself
,
``
Is
'
t
the
meanin
'
or
the
words
as
makes
folks
fast
i
'
*NL*
wedlock
?
''
For
the
parson
meant
right
,
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
*NL*
meant
right
.
But
then
,
when
I
come
to
think
on
it
,
meanin
'
goes
but
a
*NL*
little
way
i
'
most
things
,
for
you
may
mean
to
stick
things
together
*NL*
and
your
glue
may
be
bad
,
and
then
where
are
you
?
And
so
I
says
to
*NL*
mysen
,
``
It
is
n't
the
meanin
'
,
it
's
the
glue
.
''
And
I
was
worreted
as
if
*NL*
I
'd
got
three
bells
to
pull
at
once
,
when
we
went
into
the
vestry
,
and
*NL*
they
begun
to
sign
their
names
.
But
where
's
the
use
o
'
talking
?
--
you
*NL*
ca
n't
think
what
goes
on
in
a
`
cute
man
's
inside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
held
in
for
all
that
,
did
n't
you
,
Mr.
Macey
?
''
said
the
*NL*
landlord
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
I
held
in
tight
till
I
was
by
mysen
wi
'
Mr.
Drumlow
,
and
then
I
*NL*
out
wi
'
everything
,
but
respectful
,
as
I
allays
did
.
And
he
made
light
*NL*
on
it
,
and
he
says
,
``
Pooh
,
pooh
,
Macey
,
make
yourself
easy
,
''
he
says
;
*NL*
``
it
's
neither
the
meaning
nor
the
words
--
it
's
the
re_ges_ter
does
*NL*
it
--
that
's
the
glue
.
''
So
you
see
he
settled
it
easy
;
for
parsons
and
*NL*
doctors
know
everything
by
heart
,
like
,
so
as
they
are
n't
worreted
wi
'
*NL*
thinking
what
's
the
rights
and
wrongs
o
'
things
,
as
I
'n
been
many
and
*NL*
many
's
the
time
.
And
sure
enough
the
wedding
turned
out
all
right
,
*NL*
on
'
y
poor
Mrs.
Lammeter
--
that
's
Miss
Osgood
as
was
--
died
afore
the
*NL*
lasses
was
growed
up
;
but
for
prosperity
and
everything
respectable
,
*NL*
there
's
no
family
more
looked
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
of
Mr.
Macey
's
audience
had
heard
this
story
many
times
,
but
*NL*
it
was
listened
to
as
if
it
had
been
a
favourite
tune
,
and
at
certain
*NL*
points
the
puffing
of
the
pipes
was
momentarily
suspended
,
that
the
*NL*
listeners
might
give
their
whole
minds
to
the
expected
words
.
But
*NL*
there
was
more
to
come
;
and
Mr.
Snell
,
the
landlord
,
duly
put
the
*NL*
leading
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
old
Mr.
Lammeter
had
a
pretty
fortin
,
did
n't
they
say
,
when
he
*NL*
come
into
these
parts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Macey
;
``
but
I
daresay
it
's
as
much
as
this
Mr.
*NL*
Lammeter
's
done
to
keep
it
whole
.
For
there
was
allays
a
talk
as
*NL*
nobody
could
get
rich
on
the
Warrens
:
though
he
holds
it
cheap
,
for
*NL*
it
's
what
they
call
Charity
Land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
and
there
's
few
folks
know
so
well
as
you
how
it
come
to
be
*NL*
Charity
Land
,
eh
,
Mr.
Macey
?
''
said
the
butcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
they
?
''
said
the
old
clerk
,
with
some
contempt
.
``
Why
,
my
*NL*
grandfather
made
the
grooms
'
livery
for
that
Mr.
Cliff
as
came
and
*NL*
built
the
big
stables
at
the
Warrens
.
Why
,
they
're
stables
four
times
*NL*
as
big
as
Squire
Cass
's
,
for
he
thought
o
'
nothing
but
hosses
and
*NL*
hunting
,
Cliff
did
n't
--
a
Lunnon
tailor
,
some
folks
said
,
as
had
gone
*NL*
mad
wi
'
cheating
.
For
he
could
n't
ride
;
lor
bless
you
!
they
said
he
'd
*NL*
got
no
more
grip
o
'
the
hoss
than
if
his
legs
had
been
cross-sticks
:
my
*NL*
grandfather
heared
old
Squire
Cass
say
so
many
and
many
a
time
.
But
*NL*
ride
he
would
,
as
if
Old
Harry
had
been
a-driving
him
;
and
he
'd
a
son
,
*NL*
a
lad
o
'
sixteen
;
and
nothing
would
his
father
have
him
do
,
but
he
must
*NL*
ride
and
ride
--
though
the
lad
was
frighted
,
they
said
.
And
it
was
a
*NL*
common
saying
as
the
father
wanted
to
ride
the
tailor
out
o
'
the
lad
,
*NL*
and
make
a
gentleman
on
him
--
not
but
what
I
'm
a
tailor
myself
,
but
in
*NL*
respect
as
God
made
me
such
,
I
'm
proud
on
it
,
for
``
Macey
,
tailor
''
,
's
*NL*
been
wrote
up
over
our
door
since
afore
the
Queen
's
heads
went
out
on
*NL*
the
shillings
.
But
Cliff
,
he
was
ashamed
o
'
being
called
a
tailor
,
and
*NL*
he
was
sore
vexed
as
his
riding
was
laughed
at
,
and
nobody
o
'
the
*NL*
gentlefolks
hereabout
could
abide
him
.
Howsomever
,
the
poor
lad
got
*NL*
sickly
and
died
,
and
the
father
did
n't
live
long
after
him
,
for
he
got
*NL*
queerer
nor
ever
,
and
they
said
he
used
to
go
out
i
'
the
dead
o
'
the
*NL*
night
,
wi
'
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
to
the
stables
,
and
set
a
lot
o
'
*NL*
lights
burning
,
for
he
got
as
he
could
n't
sleep
;
and
there
he
'd
stand
,
*NL*
cracking
his
whip
and
looking
at
his
hosses
;
and
they
said
it
was
a
*NL*
mercy
as
the
stables
did
n't
get
burnt
down
wi
'
the
poor
dumb
creaturs
*NL*
in
'em
.
But
at
last
he
died
raving
,
and
they
found
as
he
'd
left
all
*NL*
his
property
,
Warrens
and
all
,
to
a
Lunnon
Charity
,
and
that
's
how
the
*NL*
Warrens
come
to
be
Charity
Land
;
though
,
as
for
the
stables
,
Mr.
*NL*

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

in

much
candour
and
tolerance
.
``
There

i

my

they
stood
as
plain
as

*NL*
before

there
's
reason

says
to
myself

``

I
mean
,
putting

contrairiways

so

I

for

I

what
I

*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
's
analogical
argument
was
not
well
received
by
the
*NL*
farrier
--
a
man
intensely
opposed
to
compromise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut

he
said
,
setting
down
his
glass
with
refreshed
irritation
;
*NL*
``
what
's
the

got
to
do

Did
ever

eye

what
I

*NL*
``
As

said
*NL*
Mr.

,
in
deep
disgust
at

crass

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
the
next
moment
there
seemed
to
be
some
evidence
that
ghosts
had
a
*NL*
more
condescending
disposition
than
Mr.
Macey
attributed
to
them
;
for
*NL*
the
pale
thin
figure
of
Silas
Marner
was
suddenly
seen
standing
in
the
*NL*
warm
light
,
uttering
no
word
,
but
looking
round
at
the
company
with
his
*NL*
strange
unearthly
eyes
.
The
long
pipes
gave
a
simultaneous
movement
,
*NL*
like
the
antennae
of
startled
insects
,
and
every
man
present
,
not
*NL*
excepting
even
the
sceptical
farrier
,
had
an
impression
that
he
saw
,
*NL*
not
Silas
Marner
in
the
flesh
,
but
an
apparition
;
for
the
door
by
which
*NL*
Silas
had
entered
was
hidden
by
the
high-screened
seats
,
and
no
one
had
*NL*
noticed
his
approach
.
Mr.
Macey
,
sitting
a
long
way
off
the
ghost
,
*NL*
might
be
supposed
to
have
felt
an
argumentative
triumph
,
which
would
*NL*
tend
to
neutralize
his
share
of
the
general
alarm
.
Had
he
not
always
*NL*
said
that
when
Silas
Marner
was
in
that
strange
trance
of
his
,
his
soul
*NL*
went
loose
from
his
body
?
Here
was
the
demonstration
:
nevertheless
,
on
*NL*
the
whole
,
he
would
have
been
as
well
contented
without
it
.
For
a
few
*NL*
moments
there
was
a
dead
silence
,
Marner
's
want
of
breath
and
agitation
*NL*
not
allowing
him
to
speak
.
The
landlord
,
under
the
habitual
sense
that
*NL*
he
was
bound
to
keep
his
house
open
to
all
company
,
and
confident
in
*NL*
the
protection
of
his
unbroken
neutrality
,
at
last
took
on
himself
the
*NL*
task
of
adjuring
the
ghost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Marner
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
conciliatory
tone
,
``
what
's
lacking
to
*NL*
you
?
What
's
your
business
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Robbed
!
''
said
Silas
,
gaspingly
.
``
I
've
been
robbed
!
I
want
the
*NL*
constable
--
and
the
Justice
--
and
Squire
Cass
--
and
Mr.
Crackenthorp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lay
hold
on
him
,
Jem
Rodney
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
the
idea
of
a
ghost
*NL*
subsiding
;
``
he
's
off
his
head
,
I
doubt
.
He
's
wet
through
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jem
Rodney
was
the
outermost
man
,
and
sat
conveniently
near
Marner
's
*NL*
standing-place
;
but
he
declined
to
give
his
services
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
lay
hold
on
him
yourself
,
Mr.
Snell
,
if
you
've
a
mind
,
''
said
*NL*
Jem
,
rather
sullenly
.
``
He
's
been
robbed
,
and
murdered
too
,
for
what
I
*NL*
know
,
''
he
added
,
in
a
muttering
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jem
Rodney
!
''
said
Silas
,
turning
and
fixing
his
strange
eyes
on
the
*NL*
suspected
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
Master
Marner
,
what
do
you
want
wi
'
me
?
''
said
Jem
,
trembling
a
*NL*
little
,
and
seizing
his
drinking-can
as
a
defensive
weapon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
was
you
stole
my
money
,
''
said
Silas
,
clasping
his
hands
*NL*
entreatingly
,
and
raising
his
voice
to
a
cry
,
``
give
it
me
back
--
and
I
*NL*
wo
n't
meddle
with
you
.
I
wo
n't
set

constable
on
you
.
Give
it

*NL*
back

'll

I
'll
let
you
have
a
guinea

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

stole
your
money

said
Jem
,
angrily
.
``
I
'll
pitch
this
can
at

your
eye

you
talk
o

_
my
_
stealing

money

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
Master
Marner
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
now
rising
resolutely
,
*NL*
and
seizing
Marner
by
the
shoulder
,
``
if
you
've
got
any
information
to
*NL*
lay
,
speak
it
out
sensible
,
and
show
as
you

in
your
right
mind
,
if
*NL*
you
expect
anybody
to
listen
to
you
.
You
're
as
wet
as
a
drownded
rat

*NL*
Sit
down
and
dry
yourself
,
and
speak
straight
forrard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
man
,
''
said
the
farrier
,
who
began
to
feel
that
he
had
*NL*
not
been
quite
on
a
par
with
himself
and
the
occasion
.
``
Let
's
have
no
*NL*
more
staring
and
screaming
,
else
we
'll
have
you
strapped
for
a
madman
.
*NL*
That
was
why
I
did
n't
speak
at
the
first
--
thinks
I
,
the
man
's
run
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
make
him
sit
down
,
''
said
several
voices
at
once
,
well
*NL*
pleased
that
the
reality
of
ghosts
remained
still
an
open
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
forced
Marner
to
take
off
his
coat
,
and
then
to
sit
down
*NL*
on
a
chair
aloof
from
every
one
else
,
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
and
*NL*
in
the
direct
rays
of
the
fire
.
The
weaver
,
too
feeble
to
have
any
*NL*
distinct
purpose
beyond
that
of
getting
help
to
recover
his
money
,
*NL*
submitted
unresistingly
.
The
transient
fears
of
the
company
were
now
*NL*
forgotten
in
their
strong
curiosity
,
and
all
faces
were
turned
towards
*NL*
Silas
,
when
the
landlord
,
having
seated
himself
again
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
Master
Marner
,
what
's
this
you
've
got
to
say
--
as
you
've
been
*NL*
robbed
?
Speak
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'd
better
not
say
again
as
it
was
me
robbed
him
,
''
cried
Jem
Rodney
,
*NL*
hastily
.
``
What
could
I
ha
'
done
with
his
money
?
I
could
as
easy
steal
*NL*
the
parson
's
surplice
,
and
wear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
,
Jem
,
and
let
's
hear
what
he
's
got
to
say
,
''
said
the
*NL*
landlord
.
``
Now
then
,
Master
Marner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
now
told
his
story
,
under
frequent
questioning
as
the
mysterious
*NL*
character
of
the
robbery
became
evident
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
strangely
novel
situation
of
opening
his
trouble
to
his
Raveloe
*NL*
neighbours
,
of
sitting
in
the
warmth
of
a
hearth
not
his
own
,
and
*NL*
feeling
the
presence
of
faces
and
voices
which
were
his
nearest
promise
*NL*
of
help
,
had
doubtless
its
influence
on
Marner
,
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
passionate
preoccupation
with
his
loss
.
Our
consciousness
rarely
*NL*
registers
the
beginning
of
a
growth
within
us
any
more
than
without
us
:
*NL*
there
have
been
many
circulations
of
the
sap
before
we
detect
the
*NL*
smallest
sign
of
the
bud
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slight
suspicion
with
which
his
hearers
at
first
listened
to
him
,
*NL*
gradually
melted
away
before
the
convincing
simplicity
of
his
distress
:
*NL*
it
was
impossible
for
the
neighbours
to
doubt
that
Marner
was
telling
*NL*
the
truth
,
not
because
they
were
capable
of
arguing
at
once
from
the
*NL*
nature
of
his
statements
to
the
absence
of
any
motive
for
making
them
*NL*
falsely
,
but
because
,
as
Mr.
Macey
observed
,
``
Folks
as
had
the
devil
to
*NL*
back
'em
were
not
likely
to
be
so
mushed
''
as
poor
Silas
was
.
Rather
,
*NL*
from
the
strange
fact
that
the
robber
had
left
no
traces
,
and
had
*NL*
happened
to
know
the
nick
of
time
,
utterly
incalculable
by
mortal
*NL*
agents
,
when
Silas
would
go
away
from
home
without
locking
his
door
,
*NL*
the
more
probable
conclusion
seemed
to
be
,
that
his
disreputable
*NL*
intimacy
in
that
quarter
,
if
it
ever
existed
,
had
been
broken
up
,
and
*NL*
that
,
in
consequence
,
this
ill
turn
had
been
done
to
Marner
by
somebody
*NL*
it
was
quite
in
vain
to
set
the
constable
after
.
Why
this
*NL*
preternatural
felon
should
be
obliged
to
wait
till
the
door
was
left
*NL*
unlocked
,
was
a
question
which
did
not
present
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
Jem
Rodney
as
has
done
this
work
,
Master
Marner
,
''
said
the
*NL*
landlord
.
``
You
must
n't
be
a-casting
your
eye
at
poor
Jem
.
There
may
be
*NL*
a
bit
of
a
reckoning
against
Jem
for
the
matter
of
a
hare
or
so
,
if
*NL*
anybody
was
bound
to
keep
their
eyes
staring
open
,
and
niver
to
wink
;
*NL*
but
Jem
's
been
a-sitting
here
drinking
his
can
,
like
the
decentest
man
*NL*
i
'
the
parish
,
since
before
you
left
your
house
,
Master
Marner
,
by
your
*NL*
own
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
said
Mr.
Macey
;
``
let
's
have
no
accusing
o
'
the
innicent
.
*NL*
That
is
n't
the
law
.
There
must
be
folks
to
swear
again

a
man
before
*NL*
he
can
be
ta'en
up
.
Let
's
have
no
accusing
o
'
the
innicent
,
Master
*NL*
Marner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Memory
was
not
so
utterly
torpid
in
Silas
that
it
could
not
be
awakened
*NL*
by
these
words
.
With
a
movement
of
compunction
as
new
and
strange
to
*NL*
him
as
everything
else
within
the
last
hour
,
he
started
from
his
chair
*NL*
and
went
close
up
to
Jem
,
looking
at
him
as
if
he
wanted
to
assure
*NL*
himself
of
the
expression
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
wrong
,
''
he
said
--
``
yes
,
yes
--
I
ought
to
have
thought
.
There
's
*NL*
nothing
to
witness
against
you
,
Jem
.
Only
you
'd
been
into
my
house
*NL*
oftener
than
anybody
else
,
and
so
you
came
into
my
head
.
I
do
n't
accuse
*NL*
you
--
I
wo
n't
accuse
anybody
--
only
,
''
he
added
,
lifting
up
his
hands
to
*NL*
his
head
,
and
turning
away
with
bewildered
misery
,
``
I
try
--
I
try
to
*NL*
think
where
my
guineas
can
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
they
're
gone
where
it
's
hot
enough
to
melt
'em
,
I
doubt
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Macey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tchuh
!
''
said
the
farrier
.
And
then
he
asked
,
with
a
cross-examining
*NL*
air
,
``
How
much
money
might
there
be
in
the
bags
,
Master
Marner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
hundred
and
seventy-two
pounds
,
twelve
and
sixpence
,
last
night
*NL*
when
I
counted
it
,
''
said
Silas
,
seating
himself
again
,
with
a
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
why
,
they
'd
be
none
so
heavy
to
carry
.
Some
tramp
's
been
in
,
*NL*
that
's
all
;
and
as
for
the
no
footmarks
,
and
the
bricks
and
the
sand
*NL*
being
all
right
--
why
,
your
eyes
are
pretty
much
like
a
insect
's
,
Master
*NL*
Marner
;
they
're
obliged
to
look
so
close
,
you
ca
n't
see
much
at
a
time
.
*NL*
It
's
my
opinion
as
,
if
I
'd
been
you
,
or
you
'd
been
me
--
for
it
comes
to
*NL*
the
same
thing
--
you
would
n't
have
thought
you
'd
found
everything
as
you
*NL*
left
it
.
But
what
I
vote
is
,
as
two
of
the
sensiblest
o
'
the
company
*NL*
should
go
with
you
to
Master
Kench
,
the
constable
's
--
he
's
ill
i
'
bed
,
I
*NL*
know
that
much
--
and
get
him
to
appoint
one
of
us
his
deppity
;
for
*NL*
that
's
the
law
,
and
I
do
n't
think
anybody
`
ull
take
upon
him
to
*NL*
contradick
me
there
.
It
is
n't
much
of
a
walk
to
Kench
's
;
and
then
,
if
*NL*
it
's
me
as
is
deppity
,
I
'll
go
back
with
you
,
Master
Marner
,
and
*NL*
examine
your
premises
;
and
if
anybody
's
got
any
fault
to
find
with
*NL*
that
,
I
'll
thank
him
to
stand
up
and
say
it
out
like
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
pregnant
speech
the
farrier
had
re-established
his
*NL*
self-complacency
,
and
waited
with
confidence
to
hear
himself
named
as
*NL*
one
of
the
superlatively
sensible
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see
how
the
night
is
,
though
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
who
also
*NL*
considered
himself
personally
concerned
in
this
proposition
.
``
Why
,
it
*NL*
rains
heavy
still
,
''
he
said
,
returning
from
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
not
the
man
to
be
afraid
o
'
the
rain
,
''
said
the
farrier
.
*NL*
``
For
it
'll
look
bad
when
Justice
Malam
hears
as
respectable
men
like
us
*NL*
had
a
information
laid
before
'em
and
took
no
steps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
agreed
with
this
view
,
and
after
taking
the
sense
of
the
*NL*
company
,
and
duly
rehearsing
a
small
ceremony
known
in
high
*NL*
ecclesiastical
life
as
the
_
nolo
episcopari
_
,
he
consented
to
take
on
*NL*
himself
the
chill
dignity
of
going
to
Kench
's
.
But
to
the
farrier
's
*NL*
strong
disgust
,
Mr.
Macey
now
started
an
objection
to
his
proposing
*NL*
himself
as
a
deputy-constable
;
for
that
oracular
old
gentleman
,
*NL*
claiming
to
know
the
law
,
stated
,
as
a
fact
delivered
to
him
by
his
*NL*
father
,
that
no
doctor
could
be
a
constable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
're
a
doctor
,
I
reckon
,
though
you
're
only
a
cow-doctor
--
for
a
*NL*
fly
's
a
fly
,
though
it
may
be
a
hoss-fly
,
''
concluded
Mr.
Macey
,
*NL*
wondering
a
little
at
his
own
''
`
cuteness
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
hot
debate
upon
this
,
the
farrier
being
of
course
*NL*
indisposed
to
renounce
the
quality
of
doctor
,
but
contending
that
a
*NL*
doctor
could
be
a
constable
if
he
liked
--
the
law
meant
,
he
need
n't
be
*NL*
one
if
he
did
n't
like
.
Mr.
Macey
thought
this
was
nonsense
,
since
the
*NL*
law
was
not
likely
to
be
fonder
of
doctors
than
of
other
folks
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
if
it
was
in
the
nature
of
doctors
more
than
of
other
men
not
*NL*
to
like
being
constables
,
how
came
Mr.
Dowlas
to
be
so
eager
to
act
in
*NL*
that
capacity
?
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
do
n't
want
to
act
the
constable
,
''
said
the
farrier
,
driven
into
a
*NL*
corner
by
this
merciless
reasoning
;
``
and
there
's
no
man
can
say
it
of
*NL*
me
,
if
he
'd
tell
the
truth
.
But
if
there
's
to
be
any
jealousy
and
*NL*
en_vy_ing
about
going
to
Kench
's
in
the
rain
,
let
them
go
as
like
*NL*
it
--
you
wo
n't
get
me
to
go
,
I
can
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
landlord
's
intervention
,
however
,
the
dispute
was
accommodated
.
*NL*
Mr.
Dowlas
consented
to
go
as
a
second
person
disinclined
to
act
*NL*
officially
;
and
so
poor
Silas
,
furnished
with
some
old
coverings
,
*NL*
turned
out
with
his
two
companions
into
the
rain
again
,
thinking
of
the
*NL*
long
night-hours
before
him
,
not
as
those
do
who
long
to
rest
,
but
as
*NL*
those
who
expect
to
``
watch
for
the
morning
''
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
When
Godfrey
Cass
returned
from
Mrs.
Osgood
's
party
at
midnight
,
he
was
*NL*
not
much
surprised
to
learn
that
Dunsey
had
not
come
home
.
Perhaps
he
*NL*
had
not
sold
Wildfire
,
and
was
waiting
for
another
chance
--
perhaps
,
on
*NL*
that
foggy
afternoon
,
he
had
preferred
housing
himself
at
the
Red
Lion
*NL*
at
Batherley
for
the
night
,
if
the
run
had
kept
him
in
that
*NL*
neighbourhood
;
for
he
was
not
likely
to
feel
much
concern
about
leaving
*NL*
his
brother
in
suspense
.
Godfrey
's
mind
was
too
full
of
Nancy
*NL*
Lammeter
's
looks
and
behaviour
,
too
full
of
the
exasperation
against
*NL*
himself
and
his
lot
,
which
the
sight
of
her
always
produced
in
him
,
for
*NL*
him
to
give
much
thought
to
Wildfire
,
or
to
the
probabilities
of
*NL*
Dunstan
's
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
the
whole
village
was
excited
by
the
story
of
the
*NL*
robbery
,
and
Godfrey
,
like
every
one
else
,
was
occupied
in
gathering
*NL*
and
discussing
news
about
it
,
and
in
visiting
the
Stone-pits
.
The
rain
*NL*
had
washed
away
all
possibility
of
distinguishing
foot-marks
,
but
a
*NL*
close
investigation
of
the
spot
had
disclosed
,
in
the
direction
*NL*
opposite
to
the
village
,
a
tinder-box
,
with
a
flint
and
steel
,
half
*NL*
sunk
in
the
mud
.
It
was
not
Silas
's
tinder-box
,
for
the
only
one
he
*NL*
had
ever
had
was
still
standing
on
his
shelf
;
and
the
inference
*NL*
generally
accepted
was
,
that
the
tinder-box
in
the
ditch
was
somehow
*NL*
connected
with
the
robbery
.
A
small
minority
shook
their
heads
,
and
*NL*
intimated
their
opinion
that
it
was
not
a
robbery
to
have
much
light
*NL*
thrown
on
it
by
tinder-boxes
,
that
Master
Marner
's
tale
had
a
queer
*NL*
look
with
it
,
and
that
such
things
had
been
known
as
a
man
's
doing
*NL*
himself
a
mischief
,
and
then
setting
the
justice
to
look
for
the
doer
.
*NL*
But
when
questioned
closely
as
to
their
grounds
for
this
opinion
,
and
*NL*
what
Master
Marner
had
to
gain
by
such
false
pretences
,
they
only
shook
*NL*
their
heads
as
before
,
and
observed
that
there
was
no
knowing
what
some
*NL*
folks
counted
gain
;
moreover
,
that
everybody
had
a
right
to
their
own
*NL*
opinions
,
grounds
or
no
grounds
,
and
that
the
weaver
,
as
everybody
*NL*
knew
,
was
partly
crazy
.
Mr.
Macey
,
though
he
joined
in
the
defence
of
*NL*
Marner
against
all
suspicions
of
deceit
,
also
pooh-poohed
the
*NL*
tinder-box
;
indeed
,
repudiated
it
as
a
rather
impious
suggestion
,
*NL*
tending
to
imply
that
everything
must
be
done
by
human
hands
,
and
that
*NL*
there
was
no
power
which
could
make
away
with
the
guineas
without
*NL*
moving
the
bricks
.
Nevertheless
,
he
turned
round
rather
sharply
on
Mr.
*NL*
Tookey
,
when
the
zealous
deputy
,
feeling
that
this
was
a
view
of
the
*NL*
case
peculiarly
suited
to
a
parish-clerk
,
carried
it
still
farther
,
and
*NL*
doubted
whether
it
was
right
to
inquire
into
a
robbery
at
all
when
the
*NL*
circumstances
were
so
mysterious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
,
''
concluded
Mr.
Tookey
--
``
as
if
there
was
nothing
but
what
could
*NL*
be
made
out
by
justices
and
constables
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
do
n't
you
be
for
overshooting
the
mark
,
Tookey
,
''
said
Mr.
Macey
,
*NL*
nodding
his
head
aside
admonishingly
.
``
That
's
what
you
're
allays
at
;
*NL*
if
I
throw
a
stone
and
hit
,
you
think
there
's
summat
better
than
*NL*
hitting
,
and
you
try
to
throw
a
stone
beyond
.
What
I
said
was
against
*NL*
the
tinder-box
:
I
said
nothing
against
justices
and
constables
,
for
*NL*
they
're
o
'
King
George
's
making
,
and
it
`
ud
be
ill-becoming
a
man
in
a
*NL*
parish
office
to
fly
out
again
'
King
George
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
discussions
were
going
on
amongst
the
group
outside
the
*NL*
Rainbow
,
a
higher
consultation
was
being
carried
on
within
,
under
the
*NL*
presidency
of
Mr.
Crackenthorp
,
the
rector
,
assisted
by
Squire
Cass
and
*NL*
other
substantial
parishioners
.
It
had
just
occurred
to
Mr.
Snell
,
the
*NL*
landlord
--
he
being
,
as
he
observed
,
a
man
accustomed
to
put
two
and
two
*NL*
together
--
to
connect
with
the
tinder-box
,
which
,
as
deputy-constable
,
*NL*
he
himself
had
had
the
honourable
distinction
of
finding
,
certain
*NL*
recollections
of
a
pedlar
who
had
called
to
drink
at
the
house
about
a
*NL*
month
before
,
and
had
actually
stated
that
he
carried
a
tinder-box
*NL*
about
with
him
to
light
his
pipe
.
Here
,
surely
,
was
a
clue
to
be
*NL*
followed
out
.
And
as
memory
,
when
duly
impregnated
with
ascertained
*NL*
facts
,
is
sometimes
surprisingly
fertile
,
Mr.
Snell
gradually
recovered
*NL*
a
vivid
impression
of
the
effect
produced
on
him
by
the
pedlar
's
*NL*
countenance
and
conversation
.
He
had
a
``
look
with
his
eye
''
which
fell
*NL*
unpleasantly
on
Mr.
Snell
's
sensitive
organism
.
To
be
sure
,
he
did
n't
*NL*
say
anything
particular
--
no
,
except
that
about
the
tinder-box
--
but
it
*NL*
is
n't
what
a
man
says
,
it
's
the
way
he
says
it
.
Moreover
,
he
had
a
*NL*
swarthy
foreignness
of
complexion
which
boded
little
honesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
wear
ear-rings
?
''
Mr.
Crackenthorp
wished
to
know
,
having
some
*NL*
acquaintance
with
foreign
customs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
stay
--
let
me
see
,
''
said
Mr.
Snell
,
like
a
docile
clairvoyante
,
*NL*
who
would
really
not
make
a
mistake
if
she
could
help
it
.
After
*NL*
stretching
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
contracting
his
eyes
,
as
if
he
*NL*
were
trying
to
see
the
ear-rings
,
he
appeared
to
give
up
the
effort
,
*NL*
and
said
,
``
Well
,
he
'd
got
ear-rings
in
his
box
to
sell
,
so
it
's
nat
`
ral
*NL*
to
suppose
he
might
wear
'em
.
But
he
called
at
every
house
,
a
`
most
,
in
*NL*
the
village
;
there
's
somebody
else
,
mayhap
,
saw
'em
in
his
ears
,
though
*NL*
I
ca
n't
take
upon
me
rightly
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Snell
was
correct
in
his
surmise
,
that
somebody
else
would
remember
*NL*
the
pedlar
's
ear-rings
.
For
on
the
spread
of
inquiry
among
the
*NL*
villagers
it
was
stated
with
gathering
emphasis
,
that
the
parson
had
*NL*
wanted
to
know
whether
the
pedlar
wore
ear-rings
in
his
ears
,
and
an
*NL*
impression
was
created
that
a
great
deal
depended
on
the
eliciting
of
*NL*
this
fact
.
Of
course
,
every
one
who
heard
the
question
,
not
having
any
*NL*
distinct
image
of
the
pedlar
as
_
without
_
ear-rings
,
immediately
had
an
*NL*
image
of
him
_
with
_
ear-rings
,
larger
or
smaller
,
as
the
case
might
be
;
*NL*
and
the
image
was
presently
taken
for
a
vivid
recollection
,
so
that
the
*NL*
glazier
's
wife
,
a
well-intentioned
woman
,
not
given
to
lying
,
and
whose
*NL*
house
was
among
the
cleanest
in
the
village
,
was
ready
to
declare
,
as
*NL*
sure
as
ever
she
meant
to
take
the
sacrament
the
very
next
Christmas
*NL*
that
was
ever
coming
,
that
she
had
seen
big
ear-rings
,
in
the
shape
of
*NL*
the
young
moon
,
in
the
pedlar
's
two
ears
;
while
Jinny
Oates
,
the
*NL*
cobbler
's
daughter
,
being
a
more
imaginative
person
,
stated
not
only
*NL*
that
she
had
seen
them
too
,
but
that
they
had
made
her
blood
creep
,
as
*NL*
it
did
at
that
very
moment
while
there
she
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Also
,
by
way
of
throwing
further
light
on
this
clue
of
the
tinder-box
,
*NL*
a
collection
was
made
of
all
the
articles
purchased
from
the
pedlar
at
*NL*
various
houses
,
and
carried
to
the
Rainbow
to
be
exhibited
there
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
there
was
a
general
feeling
in
the
village
,
that
for
the
*NL*
clearing-up
of
this
robbery
there
must
be
a
great
deal
done
at
the
*NL*
Rainbow
,
and
that
no
man
need
offer
his
wife
an
excuse
for
going
there
*NL*
while
it
was
the
scene
of
severe
public
duties
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
disappointment
was
felt
,
and
perhaps
a
little
indignation
also
,
*NL*
when
it
became
known
that
Silas
Marner
,
on
being
questioned
by
the
*NL*
Squire
and
the
parson
,
had
retained
no
other
recollection
of
the
pedlar
*NL*
than
that
he
had
called
at
his
door
,
but
had
not
entered
his
house
,
*NL*
having
turned
away
at
once
when
Silas
,
holding
the
door
ajar
,
had
said
*NL*
that
he
wanted
nothing
.
This
had
been
Silas
's
testimony
,
though
he
*NL*
clutched
strongly
at
the
idea
of
the
pedlar
's
being
the
culprit
,
if
*NL*
only
because
it
gave
him
a
definite
image
of
a
whereabout
for
his
gold
*NL*
after
it
had
been
taken
away
from
its
hiding-place
:
he
could
see
it
now
*NL*
in
the
pedlar
's
box
.
But
it
was
observed
with
some
irritation
in
the
*NL*
village
,
that
anybody
but
a
``
blind
creatur
''
like
Marner
would
have
seen
*NL*
the
man
prowling
about
,
for
how
came
he
to
leave
his
tinder-box
in
the
*NL*
ditch
close
by
,
if
he
had
n't
been
lingering
there
?
Doubtless
,
he
had
*NL*
made
his
observations
when
he
saw
Marner
at
the
door
.
Anybody
might
*NL*
know
--
and
only
look
at
him
--
that
the
weaver
was
a
half-crazy
miser
.
It
*NL*
was
a
wonder
the
pedlar
had
n't
murdered
him
;
men
of
that
sort
,
with
*NL*
rings
in
their
ears
,
had
been
known
for
murderers
often
and
often
;
*NL*
there
had
been
one
tried
at
the
`
sizes
,
not
so
long
ago
but
what
there
*NL*
were
people
living
who
remembered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
Cass
,
indeed
,
entering
the
Rainbow
during
one
of
Mr.
Snell
's
*NL*
frequently
repeated
recitals
of
his
testimony
,
had
treated
it
lightly
,
*NL*
stating
that
he
himself
had
bought
a
pen-knife
of
the
pedlar
,
and
*NL*
thought
him
a
merry
grinning
fellow
enough
;
it
was
all
nonsense
,
he
*NL*
said
,
about
the
man
's
evil
looks
.
But
this
was
spoken
of
in
the
*NL*
village
as
the
random
talk
of
youth
,
``
as
if
it
was
only
Mr.
Snell
who
*NL*
had
seen
something
odd
about
the
pedlar
!
''
On
the
contrary
,
there
were
*NL*
at
least
half-a-dozen
who
were
ready
to
go
before
Justice
Malam
,
and
*NL*
give
in
much
more
striking
testimony
than
any
the
landlord
could
*NL*
furnish
.
It
was
to
be
hoped
Mr.
Godfrey
would
not
go
to
Tarley
and
*NL*
throw
cold
water
on
what
Mr.
Snell
said
there
,
and
so
prevent
the
*NL*
justice
from
drawing
up
a
warrant
.
He
was
suspected
of
intending
this
,
*NL*
when
,
after
mid-day
,
he
was
seen
setting
off
on
horseback
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
Tarley
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
by
this
time
Godfrey
's
interest
in
the
robbery
had
faded
before
his
*NL*
growing
anxiety
about
Dunstan
and
Wildfire
,
and
he
was
going
,
not
to
*NL*
Tarley
,
but
to
Batherley
,
unable
to
rest
in
uncertainty
about
them
any
*NL*
longer
.
The
possibility
that
Dunstan
had
played
him
the
ugly
trick
of
*NL*
riding
away
with
Wildfire
,
to
return
at
the
end
of
a
month
,
when
he
had
*NL*
gambled
away
or
otherwise
squandered
the
price
of
the
horse
,
was
a
fear
*NL*
that
urged
itself
upon
him
more
,
even
,
than
the
thought
of
an
*NL*
accidental
injury
;
and
now
that
the
dance
at
Mrs.
Osgood
's
was
past
,
he
*NL*
was
irritated
with
himself
that
he
had
trusted
his
horse
to
Dunstan
.
*NL*
Instead
of
trying
to
still
his
fears
,
he
encouraged
them
,
with
that
*NL*
superstitious
impression
which
clings
to
us
all
,
that
if
we
expect
evil
*NL*
very
strongly
it
is
the
less
likely
to
come
;
and
when
he
heard
a
horse
*NL*
approaching
at
a
trot
,
and
saw
a
hat
rising
above
a
hedge
beyond
an
*NL*
angle
of
the
lane
,
he
felt
as
if
his
conjuration
had
succeeded
.
But
no
*NL*
sooner
did
the
horse
come
within
sight
,
than
his
heart
sank
again
.
It
*NL*
was
not
Wildfire
;
and
in
a
few
moments
more
he
discerned
that
the
rider
*NL*
was
not
Dunstan
,
but
Bryce
,
who
pulled
up
to
speak
,
with
a
face
that
*NL*
implied
something
disagreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Godfrey
,
that
's
a
lucky
brother
of
yours
,
that
Master
*NL*
Dunsey
,
is
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
said
Godfrey
,
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
has
n't
he
been
home
yet
?
''
said
Bryce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Home
?
no
.
What
has
happened
?
Be
quick
.
What
has
he
done
with
my
*NL*
horse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
thought
it
was
yours
,
though
he
pretended
you
had
parted
with
it
*NL*
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
thrown
him
down
and
broken
his
knees
?
''
said
Godfrey
,
flushed
*NL*
with
exasperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worse
than
that
,
''
said
Bryce
.
``
You
see
,
I
'd
made
a
bargain
with
him
*NL*
to
buy
the
horse
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
--
a
swinging
price
,
but
I
*NL*
always
liked
the
horse
.
And
what
does
he
do
but
go
and
stake
him
--
fly
*NL*
at
a
hedge
with
stakes
in
it
,
atop
of
a
bank
with
a
ditch
before
it
.
*NL*
The
horse
had
been
dead
a
pretty
good
while
when
he
was
found
.
So
he
*NL*
has
n't
been
home
since
,
has
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Home
?
no
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
``
and
he
'd
better
keep
away
.
Confound
me
for
*NL*
a
fool
!
I
might
have
known
this
would
be
the
end
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
''
said
Bryce
,
``
after
I
'd
bargained
for
the
*NL*
horse
,
it
did
come
into
my
head
that
he
might
be
riding
and
selling
the
*NL*
horse
without
your
knowledge
,
for
I
did
n't
believe
it
was
his
own
.
I
*NL*
knew
Master
Dunsey
was
up
to
his
tricks
sometimes
.
But
where
can
he
be
*NL*
gone
?
He
's
never
been
seen
at
Batherley
.
He
could
n't
have
been
hurt
,
*NL*
for
he
must
have
walked
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurt
?
''
said
Godfrey
,
bitterly
.
``
He
'll
never
be
hurt
--
he
's
made
to
*NL*
hurt
other
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
_
did
_
give
him
leave
to
sell
the
horse
,
eh
?
''
said
Bryce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
wanted
to
part
with
the
horse
--
he
was
always
a
little
too
hard
*NL*
in
the
mouth
for
me
,
''
said
Godfrey
;
his
pride
making
him
wince
under
*NL*
the
idea
that
Bryce
guessed
the
sale
to
be
a
matter
of
necessity
.
``
I
*NL*
was
going
to
see
after
him
--
I
thought
some
mischief
had
happened
.
I
'll
*NL*
go
back
now
,
''
he
added
,
turning
the
horse
's
head
,
and
wishing
he
could
*NL*
get
rid
of
Bryce
;
for
he
felt
that
the
long-dreaded
crisis
in
his
life
*NL*
was
close
upon
him
.
``
You
're
coming
on
to
Raveloe
,
are
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
no
,
not
now
,
''
said
Bryce
.
``
I
_
was
_
coming
round
there
,
for
I
*NL*
had
to
go
to
Flitton
,
and
I
thought
I
might
as
well
take
you
in
my
way
,
*NL*
and
just
let
you
know
all
I
knew
myself
about
the
horse
.
I
suppose
*NL*
Master
Dunsey
did
n't
like
to
show
himself
till
the
ill
news
had
blown
*NL*
over
a
bit
.
He
's
perhaps
gone
to
pay
a
visit
at
the
Three
Crowns
,
by
*NL*
Whitbridge
--
I
know
he
's
fond
of
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
is
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
rather
absently
.
Then
rousing
himself
,
*NL*
he
said
,
with
an
effort
at
carelessness
,
``
We
shall
hear
of
him
soon
*NL*
enough
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
's
my
turning
,
''
said
Bryce
,
not
surprised
to
perceive
that
*NL*
Godfrey
was
rather
``
down
''
;
``
so
I
'll
bid
you
good-day
,
and
wish
I
may
*NL*
bring
you
better
news
another
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
rode
along
slowly
,
representing
to
himself
the
scene
of
*NL*
confession
to
his
father
from
which
he
felt
that
there
was
now
no
*NL*
longer
any
escape
.
The
revelation
about
the
money
must
be
made
the
*NL*
very
next
morning
;
and
if
he
withheld
the
rest
,
Dunstan
would
be
sure
*NL*
to
come
back
shortly
,
and
,
finding
that
he
must
bear
the
brunt
of
his
*NL*
father
's
anger
,
would
tell
the
whole
story
out
of
spite
,
even
though
he
*NL*
had
nothing
to
gain
by
it
.
There
was
one
step
,
perhaps
,
by
which
he
*NL*
might
still
win
Dunstan
's
silence
and
put
off
the
evil
day
:
he
might
*NL*
tell
his
father
that
he
had
himself
spent
the
money
paid
to
him
by
*NL*
Fowler
;
and
as
he
had
never
been
guilty
of
such
an
offence
before
,
the
*NL*
affair
would
blow
over
after
a
little
storming
.
But
Godfrey
could
not
*NL*
bend
himself
to
this
.
He
felt
that
in
letting
Dunstan
have
the
money
,
*NL*
he
had
already
been
guilty
of
a
breach
of
trust
hardly
less
culpable
*NL*
than
that
of
spending
the
money
directly
for
his
own
behoof
;
and
yet
*NL*
there
was
a
distinction
between
the
two
acts
which
made
him
feel
that
*NL*
the
one
was
so
much
more
blackening
than
the
other
as
to
be
intolerable
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
a
good
fellow
,
''
he
said
to
himself
;
``
but
I
'm
not
*NL*
a
scoundrel
--
at
least
,
I
'll
stop
short
somewhere
.
I
'll
bear
the
*NL*
consequences
of
what
I
_
have
_
done
sooner
than
make
believe
I
've
done
*NL*
what
I
never
would
have
done
.
I
'd
never
have
spent
the
money
for
my
*NL*
own
pleasure
--
I
was
tortured
into
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
remainder
of
this
day
Godfrey
,
with
only
occasional
*NL*
fluctuations
,
kept
his
will
bent
in
the
direction
of
a
complete
avowal
*NL*
to
his
father
,
and
he
withheld
the
story
of
Wildfire
's
loss
till
the
*NL*
next
morning
,
that
it
might
serve
him
as
an
introduction
to
heavier
*NL*
matter
.
The
old
Squire
was
accustomed
to
his
son
's
frequent
absence
*NL*
from
home
,
and
thought
neither
Dunstan
's
nor
Wildfire
's
non-appearance
*NL*
a
matter
calling
for
remark
.
Godfrey
said
to
himself
again
and
again
,
*NL*
that
if
he
let
slip
this
one
opportunity
of
confession
,
he
might
never
*NL*
have
another
;
the
revelation
might
be
made
even
in
a
more
odious
way
*NL*
than
by
Dunstan
's
malignity
:
_
she
_
might
come
as
she
had
threatened
to
*NL*
do
.
And
then
he
tried
to
make
the
scene
easier
to
himself
by
*NL*
rehearsal
:
he
made
up
his
mind
how
he
would
pass
from
the
admission
of
*NL*
his
weakness
in
letting
Dunstan
have
the
money
to
the
fact
that
Dunstan
*NL*
had
a
hold
on
him
which
he
had
been
unable
to
shake
off
,
and
how
he
*NL*
would
work
up
his
father
to
expect
something
very
bad
before
he
told
*NL*
him
the
fact
.
The
old
Squire
was
an
implacable
man
:
he
made
*NL*
resolutions
in
violent
anger
,
and
he
was
not
to
be
moved
from
them
*NL*
after
his
anger
had
subsided
--
as
fiery
volcanic
matters
cool
and
harden
*NL*
into
rock
.
Like
many
violent
and
implacable
men
,
he
allowed
evils
to
*NL*
grow
under
favour
of
his
own
heedlessness
,
till
they
pressed
upon
him
*NL*
with
exasperating
force
,
and
then
he
turned
round
with
fierce
severity
*NL*
and
became
unrelentingly
hard
.
This
was
his
system
with
his
tenants
:
*NL*
he
allowed
them
to
get
into
arrears
,
neglect
their
fences
,
reduce
their
*NL*
stock
,
sell
their
straw
,
and
otherwise
go
the
wrong
way
,
--
and
then
,
*NL*
when
he
became
short
of
money
in
consequence
of
this
indulgence
,
he
*NL*
took
the
hardest
measures
and
would
listen
to
no
appeal
.
Godfrey
knew
*NL*
all
this
,
and
felt
it
with
the
greater
force
because
he
had
constantly
*NL*
suffered
annoyance
from
witnessing
his
father
's
sudden
fits
of
*NL*
unrelentingness
,
for
which
his
own
habitual
irresolution
deprived
him
*NL*
of
all
sympathy
.
-LRB-
He
was
not
critical
on
the
faulty
indulgence
which
*NL*
preceded
these
fits
;
_
that
_
seemed
to
him
natural
enough
.
-RRB-
Still
there
*NL*
was
just
the
chance
,
Godfrey
thought
,
that
his
father
's
pride
might
see
*NL*
this
marriage
in
a
light
that
would
induce
him
to
hush
it
up
,
rather
*NL*
than
turn
his
son
out
and
make
the
family
the
talk
of
the
country
for
*NL*
ten
miles
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
view
of
the
case
that
Godfrey
managed
to
keep
before
him
*NL*
pretty
closely
till
midnight
,
and
he
went
to
sleep
thinking
that
he
had
*NL*
done
with
inward
debating
.
But
when
he
awoke
in
the
still
morning
*NL*
darkness
he
found
it
impossible
to
reawaken
his
evening
thoughts
;
it
*NL*
was
as
if
they
had
been
tired
out
and
were
not
to
be
roused
to
further
*NL*
work
.
Instead
of
arguments
for
confession
,
he
could
now
feel
the
*NL*
presence
of
nothing
but
its
evil
consequences
:
the
old
dread
of
*NL*
disgrace
came
back
--
the
old
shrinking
from
the
thought
of
raising
a
*NL*
hopeless
barrier
between
himself
and
Nancy
--
the
old
disposition
to
rely
*NL*
on
chances
which
might
be
favourable
to
him
,
and
save
him
from
*NL*
betrayal
.
Why
,
after
all
,
should
he
cut
off
the
hope
of
them
by
his
*NL*
own
act
?
He
had
seen
the
matter
in
a
wrong
light
yesterday
.
He
had
*NL*
been
in
a
rage
with
Dunstan
,
and
had
thought
of
nothing
but
a
thorough
*NL*
break-up
of
their
mutual
understanding
;
but
what
it
would
be
really
*NL*
wisest
for
him
to
do
,
was
to
try
and
soften
his
father
's
anger
against
*NL*
Dunsey
,
and
keep
things
as
nearly
as
possible
in
their
old
condition
.
*NL*
If
Dunsey
did
not
come
back
for
a
few
days
-LRB-
and
Godfrey
did
not
know
*NL*
but
that
the
rascal
had
enough
money
in
his
pocket
to
enable
him
to
*NL*
keep
away
still
longer
-RRB-
,
everything
might
blow
over
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
rose
and
took
his
own
breakfast
earlier
than
usual
,
but
*NL*
lingered
in
the
wainscoted
parlour
till
his
younger
brothers
had
*NL*
finished
their
meal
and
gone
out
;
awaiting
his
father
,
who
always
took
*NL*
a
walk
with
his
managing-man
before
breakfast
.
Every
one
breakfasted
*NL*
at
a
different
hour
in
the
Red
House
,
and
the
Squire
was
always
the
*NL*
latest
,
giving
a
long
chance
to
a
rather
feeble
morning
appetite
before
*NL*
he
tried
it
.
The
table
had
been
spread
with
substantial
eatables
*NL*
nearly
two
hours
before
he
presented
himself
--
a
tall
,
stout
man
of
*NL*
sixty
,
with
a
face
in
which
the
knit
brow
and
rather
hard
glance
seemed
*NL*
contradicted
by
the
slack
and
feeble
mouth
.
His
person
showed
marks
of
*NL*
habitual
neglect
,
his
dress
was
slovenly
;
and
yet
there
was
something
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
the
old
Squire
distinguishable
from
that
of
the
*NL*
ordinary
farmers
in
the
parish
,
who
were
perhaps
every
whit
as
refined
*NL*
as
he
,
but
,
having
slouched
their
way
through
life
with
a
consciousness
*NL*
of
being
in
the
vicinity
of
their
``
betters
''
,
wanted
that
*NL*
self-possession
and
authoritativeness
of
voice
and
carriage
which
*NL*
belonged
to
a
man
who
thought
of
superiors
as
remote
existences
with
*NL*
whom
he
had
personally
little
more
to
do
than
with
America
or
the
*NL*
stars
.
The
Squire
had
been
used
to
parish
homage
all
his
life
,
used
to
*NL*
the
presupposition
that
his
family
,
his
tankards
,
and
everything
that
*NL*
was
his
,
were
the
oldest
and
best
;
and
as
he
never
associated
with
any
*NL*
gentry
higher
than
himself
,
his
opinion
was
not
disturbed
by
comparison
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
his
son
as
he
entered
the
room
,
and
said
,
``
What
,
sir
!
*NL*
have
n't
_
you
_
had
your
breakfast
yet
?
''
but
there
was
no
pleasant
*NL*
morning
greeting
between
them
;
not
because
of
any
unfriendliness
,
but
*NL*
because
the
sweet
flower
of
courtesy
is
not
a
growth
of
such
homes
as
*NL*
the
Red
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
``
I
've
had
my
breakfast
,
but
I
was
waiting
to
*NL*
speak
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
well
,
''
said
the
Squire
,
throwing
himself
indifferently
into
his
*NL*
chair
,
and
speaking
in
a
ponderous
coughing
fashion
,
which
was
felt
in
*NL*
Raveloe
to
be
a
sort
of
privilege
of
his
rank
,
while
he
cut
a
piece
of
*NL*
beef
,
and
held
it
up
before
the
deer-hound
that
had
come
in
with
him
.
*NL*
``
Ring
the
bell
for
my
ale
,
will
you
?
You
youngsters
'
business
is
your
*NL*
own
pleasure
,
mostly
.
There
's
no
hurry
about
it
for
anybody
but
*NL*
yourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Squire
's
life
was
quite
as
idle
as
his
sons
'
,
but
it
was
a
fiction
*NL*
kept
up
by
himself
and
his
contemporaries
in
Raveloe
that
youth
was
*NL*
exclusively
the
period
of
folly
,
and
that
their
aged
wisdom
was
*NL*
constantly
in
a
state
of
endurance
mitigated
by
sarcasm
.
Godfrey
*NL*
waited
,
before
he
spoke
again
,
until
the
ale
had
been
brought
and
the
*NL*
door
closed
--
an
interval
during
which
Fleet
,
the
deer-hound
,
had
*NL*
consumed
enough
bits
of
beef
to
make
a
poor
man
's
holiday
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
been
a
cursed
piece
of
ill-luck
with
Wildfire
,
''
he
began
;
*NL*
``
happened
the
day
before
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
broke
his
knees
?
''
said
the
Squire
,
after
taking
a
draught
of
*NL*
ale
.
``
I
thought
you
knew
how
to
ride
better
than
that
,
sir
.
I
never
*NL*
threw
a
horse
down
in
my
life
.
If
I
had
,
I
might
ha
'
whistled
for
*NL*
another
,
for
_
my
_
father
was
n't
quite
so
ready
to
unstring
as
some
*NL*
other
fathers
I
know
of
.
But
they
must
turn
over
a
new
leaf
--
_
they
_
*NL*
must
.
What
with
mortgages
and
arrears
,
I
'm
as
short
o
'
cash
as
a
*NL*
roadside
pauper
.
And
that
fool
Kimble
says
the
newspaper
's
talking
*NL*
about
peace
.
Why
,
the
country
would
n't
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
.
Prices
*NL*
`
ud
run
down
like
a
jack
,
and
I
should
never
get
my
arrears
,
not
if
I
*NL*
sold
all
the
fellows
up
.
And
there
's
that
damned
Fowler
,
I
wo
n't
put
*NL*
up
with
him
any
longer
;
I
've
told
Winthrop
to
go
to
Cox
this
very
day
.
*NL*
The
lying
scoundrel
told
me
he
'd
be
sure
to
pay
me
a
hundred
last
*NL*
month
.
He
takes
advantage
because
he
's
on
that
outlying
farm
,
and
*NL*
thinks
I
shall
forget
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Squire
had
delivered
this
speech
in
a
coughing
and
interrupted
*NL*
manner
,
but
with
no
pause
long
enough
for
Godfrey
to
make
it
a
pretext
*NL*
for
taking
up
the
word
again
.
He
felt
that
his
father
meant
to
ward
*NL*
off
any
request
for
money
on
the
ground
of
the
misfortune
with
*NL*
Wildfire
,
and
that
the
emphasis
he
had
thus
been
led
to
lay
on
his
*NL*
shortness
of
cash
and
his
arrears
was
likely
to
produce
an
attitude
of
*NL*
mind
the
utmost
unfavourable
for
his
own
disclosure
.
But
he
must
go
on
,
*NL*
now
he
had
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
worse
than
breaking
the
horse
's
knees
--
he
's
been
staked
and
*NL*
killed
,
''
he
said
,
as
soon
as
his
father
was
silent
,
and
had
begun
to
*NL*
cut
his
meat
.
``
But
I
was
n't
thinking
of
asking
you
to
buy
me
another
*NL*
horse
;
I
was
only
thinking
I
'd
lost
the
means
of
paying
you
with
the
*NL*
price
of
Wildfire
,
as
I
'd
meant
to
do
.
Dunsey
took
him
to
the
hunt
to
*NL*
sell
him
for
me
the
other
day
,
and
after
he
'd
made
a
bargain
for
a
*NL*
hundred
and
twenty
with
Bryce
,
he
went
after
the
hounds
,
and
took
some
*NL*
fool
's
leap
or
other
that
did
for
the
horse
at
once
.
If
it
had
n't
been
*NL*
for
that
,
I
should
have
paid
you
a
hundred
pounds
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Squire
had
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
was
staring
at
his
son
*NL*
in
amazement
,
not
being
sufficiently
quick
of
brain
to
form
a
probable
*NL*
guess
as
to
what
could
have
caused
so
strange
an
inversion
of
the
*NL*
paternal
and
filial
relations
as
this
proposition
of
his
son
to
pay
him
*NL*
a
hundred
pounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
truth
is
,
sir
--
I
'm
very
sorry
--
I
was
quite
to
blame
,
''
said
*NL*
Godfrey
.
``
Fowler
did
pay
that
hundred
pounds
.
He
paid
it
to
me
,
when
*NL*
I
was
over
there
one
day
last
month
.
And
Dunsey
bothered
me
for
the
*NL*
money
,
and
I
let
him
have
it
,
because
I
hoped
I
should
be
able
to
pay
*NL*
it
you
before
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Squire
was
purple
with
anger
before
his
son
had
done
speaking
,
and
*NL*
found
utterance
difficult
.
``
You
let
Dunsey
have
it
,
sir

And
how
long
*NL*
have
you
been
so
thick
with
Dunsey
that
you
must
_
collogue
_
with
him
to
*NL*
embezzle
my
money

Are
you
turning
out

scamp

I
tell
you

it

I
'll
turn
the
whole
pack
of
you
out

the
house
together

and
marry
again

I
'd
have
you
to
remember
,
sir

my
property
's
got
no
*NL*
entail
on
it

since
my
grandfather
's
time
the
Casses
can
do
as
they
*NL*
like
with
their
land
.
Remember
that
,
sir

Let
Dunsey
have

money

*NL*
Why
should
you
let
Dunsey
have
the
money

There
's
some
lie
at
the

bottom
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no

said
Godfrey

``
I
would
n't

Dunsey

let

But
I
meant
to
pay

whether
he
did

That
's
the
whole
story

*NL*
I
never
meant

embezzle
money

I

not
the
man

said
the
Squire
,
with
some
*NL*
disgust
at
the
idea
that
,
in
that
case
,
he
could
not
fulfil
his
threat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

believe

dead

must
have
walked
off
.
I

we
shall
see
him
again
*NL*
by-and-by

I
do

*NL*

``
And
what
must
you
be

Answer
me
that

*NL*
said
the
Squire
,
attacking
Godfrey
again
,
since
Dunsey
was
not
within
*NL*
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
hesitatingly
.
That
was
a
*NL*
feeble
evasion
,
but
Godfrey
was
not
fond
of
lying
,
and
,
not
being
*NL*
sufficiently
aware
that
no
sort
of
duplicity
can
long
flourish
without
*NL*
the
help
of
vocal
falsehoods
,
he
was
quite
unprepared
with
invented
*NL*
motives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
?
I
tell
you
what
it
is

sir

You
've
been
up
to
some
*NL*
trick
,
and
you
've
been
bribing
him
not
to
tell

''
said
the
Squire
,
with
*NL*
a
sudden
acuteness
which
startled
Godfrey
,
who
felt
his
heart
beat
*NL*
violently
at
the
nearness
of
his
father
's
guess
.
The
sudden
alarm
*NL*
pushed
him
on
to
take
the
next
step
--
a
very
slight
impulse
suffices
for
*NL*
that
on
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
trying
to
speak
with
careless
ease
,
``
it
was
a
*NL*
little
affair
between
me
and
Dunsey
;
it
's
no
matter
to
anybody
else

*NL*
It
's
hardly
worth
while
to
pry
into
young
men
's
fooleries
:
it
would
n't
*NL*
have
made
any
difference
to
you
,
sir
,
if
I
'd
not
had
the
bad
luck
to
*NL*
lose
Wildfire
.
I
should
have
paid
you
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fooleries
!
Pshaw
!
it
's
time
you
'd
done
with
fooleries
.
And
I
'd
have
*NL*
you
know
,
sir
,
you
_
must
_
ha
'
done
with
'em
,
''
said
the
Squire
,
frowning
*NL*
and
casting
an
angry
glance
at
his
son
.
``
Your
goings-on
are
not
what
I
*NL*
shall
find
money
for
any
longer
.
There
's
my
grandfather
had
his
*NL*
stables
full
o
'
horses
,
and
kept
a
good
house
,
too
,
and
in
worse
times
,
*NL*
by
what
I
can
make
out
;
and
so
might
I
,
if
I
had
n't
four
*NL*
good-for-nothing
fellows
to
hang
on
me
like
horse-leeches
.
I
've
been
*NL*
too
good
a
father
to
you
all
--
that
's
what
it
is
.
But
I
shall
pull
up
,
*NL*
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
was
silent
.
He
was
not
likely
to
be
very
penetrating
in
his
*NL*
judgments
,
but
he
had
always
had
a
sense
that
his
father
's
indulgence
*NL*
had
not
been
kindness
,
and
had
had
a
vague
longing
for
some
discipline
*NL*
that
would
have
checked
his
own
errant
weakness
and
helped
his
better
*NL*
will
.
The
Squire
ate
his
bread
and
meat
hastily
,
took
a
deep
draught
*NL*
of
ale
,
then
turned
his
chair
from
the
table
,
and
began
to
speak
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
be
all
the
worse
for
you
,
you
know
--
you
'd
need
try
and
help
me

keep
things
together

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
I
've
often
offered
to
take
the
management
of
things
,
but
*NL*
you
know
you
've
taken
it
ill
always
,
and
seemed
to
think
I
wanted
to
*NL*
push
you
out
of
your
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
o
'
your
offering
or
o

my
taking
it
ill
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Squire
,
whose
memory
consisted
in
certain
strong
impressions
unmodified
*NL*
by
detail
;
``
but
I
know
,
one
while
you
seemed
to
be
thinking
o
'
*NL*
marrying
,
and
I
did
n't
offer
to
put
any
obstacles
in
your
way
,
as
some
*NL*
fathers
would
.
I
'd
as
lieve
you
married
Lammeter
's
daughter
as
*NL*
anybody
.
I
suppose
,
if
I
'd
said
you
nay
,
you
'd
ha

kept
on
with
it
;
*NL*
but
,
for
want
o

contradiction
,
you
've
changed
your
mind
.
You
're
a
*NL*
shilly-shally
fellow
:
you
take
after
your
poor
mother
.
She
never
had
a
*NL*
will
of
her
own
;
a
woman
has
no
call
for
one
,
if
she
's
got
a
proper
man
*NL*
for
her
husband
.
But
_
your
_
wife
had
need
have
one
,
for
you
hardly
*NL*
know
your
own
mind
enough
to
make
both
your
legs
walk
one
way
.
The
*NL*
lass
has
n't
said
downright
she
wo
n't
have
you
,
has
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
feeling
very
hot
and
uncomfortable
;
``
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
she
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
!
why
have
n't
you
the
courage
to
ask
her
?
Do
you
stick
to
it
,
*NL*
you
want
to
have
_
her

that
's
the
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
other
woman
I
want
to
marry

said
Godfrey
,
evasively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

then
,
let
me
make
the
offer
for
you

that
's
all

if
you

*NL*
the
pluck

Lammeter
is

likely
to
be
loath
for
his

daughter

marry
into

my

I
should
think

And
as
for
the
*NL*
pretty

she

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

rather

said
Godfrey
,
in
alarm
.
*NL*
``
I

a
little
offended

*NL*
*NL*
``

what
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

said
the
Squire
,
with
a
short
,
scornful
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
let
the
thing
be

at

said
Godfrey
.
``
I
hope

it
on
by
saying
anything

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
do
what
I
choose

said
the
Squire
,
``
and
I
shall
let
you
know

I
'm
master

else
you
may
turn
out
and
find
an
estate
to
drop
into
*NL*
somewhere
else

Go
out
and
tell
Winthrop
not
to
go
to
Cox
's
,
but
wait
*NL*
for
me

And
tell
'em
to
get
my

And
stop
:
look
out
and
*NL*
get
that
hack
o
'
Dunsey

and
hand
me
the
money
,
will
you

He
'll
*NL*
keep
no

And
if
you
know
where
he

sneaking

I

you
do

you
may
tell
him
to
spare
himself
the
*NL*
journey

coming

Let

turn
ostler
,
and
keep
himself

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
where
he
is
,
sir
;
and
if
I
did
,
it
is
n't
my
place
to
tell
*NL*
him
to
keep
away
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
moving
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
it
,
sir
,
do
n't
stay
arguing
,
but
go
and
order
my
horse
,
''
said
*NL*
the
Squire
,
taking
up
a
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
left
the
room
,
hardly
knowing
whether
he
were
more
relieved
by
*NL*
the
sense
that
the
interview
was
ended
without
having
made
any
change
*NL*
in
his
position
,
or
more
uneasy
that
he
had
entangled
himself
still
*NL*
further
in
prevarication
and
deceit
.
What
had
passed
about
his
*NL*
proposing
to
Nancy
had
raised
a
new
alarm
,
lest
by
some
after-dinner
*NL*
words
of
his
father
's
to
Mr.
Lammeter
he
should
be
thrown
into
the
*NL*
embarrassment
of
being
obliged
absolutely
to
decline
her
when
she
*NL*
seemed
to
be
within
his
reach
.
He
fled
to
his
usual
refuge
,
that
of
*NL*
hoping
for
some
unforeseen
turn
of
fortune
,
some
favourable
chance
*NL*
which
would
save
him
from
unpleasant
consequences
--
perhaps
even
justify
*NL*
his
insincerity
by
manifesting
its
prudence
.
And
in
this
point
of
*NL*
trusting
to
some
throw
of
fortune
's
dice
,
Godfrey
can
hardly
be
called
*NL*
specially
old-fashioned
.
Favourable
Chance
,
I
fancy
,
is
the
god
of
all
*NL*
men
who
follow
their
own
devices
instead
of
obeying
a
law
they
believe
*NL*
in
.
Let
even
a
polished
man
of
these
days
get
into
a
position
he
is
*NL*
ashamed
to
avow
,
and
his
mind
will
be
bent
on
all
the
possible
issues
*NL*
that
may
deliver
him
from
the
calculable
results
of
that
position
.
Let
*NL*
him
live
outside
his
income
,
or
shirk
the
resolute
honest
work
that
*NL*
brings
wages
,
and
he
will
presently
find
himself
dreaming
of
a
possible
*NL*
benefactor
,
a
possible
simpleton
who
may
be
cajoled
into
using
his
*NL*
interest
,
a
possible
state
of
mind
in
some
possible
person
not
yet
*NL*
forthcoming
.
Let
him
neglect
the
responsibilities
of
his
office
,
and
he
*NL*
will
inevitably
anchor
himself
on
the
chance
that
the
thing
left
undone
*NL*
may
turn
out
not
to
be
of
the
supposed
importance
.
Let
him
betray
his
*NL*
friend
's
confidence
,
and
he
will
adore
that
same
cunning
complexity
*NL*
called
Chance
,
which
gives
him
the
hope
that
his
friend
will
never
*NL*
know
.
Let
him
forsake
a
decent
craft
that
he
may
pursue
the
*NL*
gentilities
of
a
profession
to
which
nature
never
called
him
,
and
his
*NL*
religion
will
infallibly
be
the
worship
of
blessed
Chance
,
which
he
*NL*
will
believe
in
as
the
mighty
creator
of
success
.
The
evil
principle
*NL*
deprecated
in
that
religion
is
the
orderly
sequence
by
which
the
seed
*NL*
brings
forth
a
crop
after
its
kind
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
Justice
Malam
was
naturally
regarded
in
Tarley
and
Raveloe
as
a
man
of
*NL*
capacious
mind
,
seeing
that
he
could
draw
much
wider
conclusions
*NL*
without
evidence
than
could
be
expected
of
his
neighbours
who
were
not
*NL*
on
the
Commission
of
the
Peace
.
Such
a
man
was
not
likely
to
neglect
*NL*
the
clue
of
the
tinder-box
,
and
an
inquiry
was
set
on
foot
concerning
a
*NL*
pedlar
,
name
unknown
,
with
curly
black
hair
and
a
foreign
complexion
,
*NL*
carrying
a
box
of
cutlery
and
jewellery
,
and
wearing
large
rings
in
his
*NL*
ears
.
But
either
because
inquiry
was
too
slow-footed
to
overtake
him
,
*NL*
or
because
the
description
applied
to
so
many
pedlars
that
inquiry
did
*NL*
not
know
how
to
choose
among
them
,
weeks
passed
away
,
and
there
was
no
*NL*
other
result
concerning
the
robbery
than
a
gradual
cessation
of
the
*NL*
excitement
it
had
caused
in
Raveloe
.
Dunstan
Cass
's
absence
was
hardly
*NL*
a
subject
of
remark
:
he
had
once
before
had
a
quarrel
with
his
father
,
*NL*
and
had
gone
off
,
nobody
knew
whither
,
to
return
at
the
end
of
six
*NL*
weeks
,
take
up
his
old
quarters
unforbidden
,
and
swagger
as
usual
.
His
*NL*
own
family
,
who
equally
expected
this
issue
,
with
the
sole
difference
*NL*
that
the
Squire
was
determined
this
time
to
forbid
him
the
old
*NL*
quarters
,
never
mentioned
his
absence
;
and
when
his
uncle
Kimble
or
Mr.
*NL*
Osgood
noticed
it
,
the
story
of
his
having
killed
Wildfire
,
and
*NL*
committed
some
offence
against
his
father
,
was
enough
to
prevent
*NL*
surprise
.
To
connect
the
fact
of
Dunsey
's
disappearance
with
that
of
*NL*
the
robbery
occurring
on
the
same
day
,
lay
quite
away
from
the
track
of
*NL*
every
one
's
thought
--
even
Godfrey
's
,
who
had
better
reason
than
any
one
*NL*
else
to
know
what
his
brother
was
capable
of
.
He
remembered
no
mention
*NL*
of
the
weaver
between
them
since
the
time
,
twelve
years
ago
,
when
it
*NL*
was
their
boyish
sport
to
deride
him
;
and
,
besides
,
his
imagination
*NL*
constantly
created
an
_
alibi
_
for
Dunstan
:
he
saw
him
continually
in
*NL*
some
congenial
haunt
,
to
which
he
had
walked
off
on
leaving
*NL*
Wildfire
--
saw
him
sponging
on
chance
acquaintances
,
and
meditating
a
*NL*
return
home
to
the
old
amusement
of
tormenting
his
elder
brother
.
Even
*NL*
if
any
brain
in
Raveloe
had
put
the
said
two
facts
together
,
I
doubt
*NL*
whether
a
combination
so
injurious
to
the
prescriptive
respectability
*NL*
of
a
family
with
a
mural
monument
and
venerable
tankards
,
would
not
*NL*
have
been
suppressed
as
of
unsound
tendency
.
But
Christmas
puddings
,
*NL*
brawn
,
and
abundance
of
spirituous
liquors
,
throwing
the
mental
*NL*
originality
into
the
channel
of
nightmare
,
are
great
preservatives
*NL*
against
a
dangerous
spontaneity
of
waking
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
robbery
was
talked
of
at
the
Rainbow
and
elsewhere
,
in
good
*NL*
company
,
the
balance
continued
to
waver
between
the
rational
*NL*
explanation
founded
on
the
tinder-box
,
and
the
theory
of
an
*NL*
impenetrable
mystery
that
mocked
investigation
.
The
advocates
of
the
*NL*
tinder-box-and-pedlar
view
considered
the
other
side
a
muddle-headed
*NL*
and
credulous
set
,
who
,
because
they
themselves
were
wall-eyed
,
*NL*
supposed
everybody
else
to
have
the
same
blank
outlook
;
and
the
*NL*
adherents
of
the
inexplicable
more
than
hinted
that
their
antagonists
*NL*
were
animals
inclined
to
crow
before
they
had
found
any
corn
--
mere
*NL*
skimming-dishes
in
point
of
depth
--
whose
clear-sightedness
consisted
in
*NL*
supposing
there
was
nothing
behind
a
barn-door
because
they
could
n't
*NL*
see
through
it
;
so
that
,
though
their
controversy
did
not
serve
to
*NL*
elicit
the
fact
concerning
the
robbery
,
it
elicited
some
true
opinions
*NL*
of
collateral
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
poor
Silas
's
loss
served
thus
to
brush
the
slow
current
of
*NL*
Raveloe
conversation
,
Silas
himself
was
feeling
the
withering
*NL*
desolation
of
that
bereavement
about
which
his
neighbours
were
arguing
*NL*
at
their
ease
.
To
any
one
who
had
observed
him
before
he
lost
his
*NL*
gold
,
it
might
have
seemed
that
so
withered
and
shrunken
a
life
as
his
*NL*
could
hardly
be
susceptible
of
a
bruise
,
could
hardly
endure
any
*NL*
subtraction
but
such
as
would
put
an
end
to
it
altogether
.
But
in
*NL*
reality
it
had
been
an
eager
life
,
filled
with
immediate
purpose
which
*NL*
fenced
him
in
from
the
wide
,
cheerless
unknown
.
It
had
been
a
clinging
*NL*
life
;
and
though
the
object
round
which
its
fibres
had
clung
was
a
dead
*NL*
disrupted
thing
,
it
satisfied
the
need
for
clinging
.
But
now
the
fence
*NL*
was
broken
down
--
the
support
was
snatched
away
.
Marner
's
thoughts
*NL*
could
no
longer
move
in
their
old
round
,
and
were
baffled
by
a
blank
*NL*
like
that
which
meets
a
plodding
ant
when
the
earth
has
broken
away
on
*NL*
its
homeward
path
.
The
loom
was
there
,
and
the
weaving
,
and
the
*NL*
growing
pattern
in
the
cloth
;
but
the
bright
treasure
in
the
hole
under
*NL*
his
feet
was
gone
;
the
prospect
of
handling
and
counting
it
was
gone
:
*NL*
the
evening
had
no
phantasm
of
delight
to
still
the
poor
soul
's
*NL*
craving
.
The
thought
of
the
money
he
would
get
by
his
actual
work
*NL*
could
bring
no
joy
,
for
its
meagre
image
was
only
a
fresh
reminder
of
*NL*
his
loss
;
and
hope
was
too
heavily
crushed
by
the
sudden
blow
for
his
*NL*
imagination
to
dwell
on
the
growth
of
a
new
hoard
from
that
small
*NL*
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
filled
up
the
blank
with
grief
.
As
he
sat
weaving
,
he
every
now
and
*NL*
then
moaned
low
,
like
one
in
pain
:
it
was
the
sign
that
his
thoughts
*NL*
had
come
round
again
to
the
sudden
chasm
--
to
the
empty
evening-time
.
*NL*
And
all
the
evening
,
as
he
sat
in
his
loneliness
by
his
dull
fire
,
he
*NL*
leaned
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
and
clasped
his
head
with
his
hands
,
*NL*
and
moaned
very
low
--
not
as
one
who
seeks
to
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
was
not
utterly
forsaken
in
his
trouble
.
The
repulsion
*NL*
Marner
had
always
created
in
his
neighbours
was
partly
dissipated
by
*NL*
the
new
light
in
which
this
misfortune
had
shown
him
.
Instead
of
a
man
*NL*
who
had
more
cunning
than
honest
folks
could
come
by
,
and
,
what
was
*NL*
worse
,
had
not
the
inclination
to
use
that
cunning
in
a
neighbourly
*NL*
way
,
it
was
now
apparent
that
Silas
had
not
cunning
enough
to
keep
his
*NL*
own
.
He
was
generally
spoken
of
as
a
``
poor
mushed
creatur
''
;
and
that
*NL*
avoidance
of
his
neighbours
,
which
had
before
been
referred
to
his
*NL*
ill-will
and
to
a
probable
addiction
to
worse
company
,
was
now
*NL*
considered
mere
craziness
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
change
to
a
kindlier
feeling
was
shown
in
various
ways
.
The
odour
*NL*
of
Christmas
cooking
being
on
the
wind
,
it
was
the
season
when
*NL*
superfluous
pork
and
black
puddings
are
suggestive
of
charity
in
*NL*
well-to-do
families
;
and
Silas
's
misfortune
had
brought
him
uppermost
*NL*
in
the
memory
of
housekeepers
like
Mrs.
Osgood
.
Mr.
Crackenthorp
,
too
,
*NL*
while
he
admonished
Silas
that
his
money
had
probably
been
taken
from
*NL*
him
because
he
thought
too
much
of
it
and
never
came
to
church
,
*NL*
enforced
the
doctrine
by
a
present
of
pigs
'
pettitoes
,
well
calculated
*NL*
to
dissipate
unfounded
prejudices
against
the
clerical
character
.
*NL*
Neighbours
who
had
nothing
but
verbal
consolation
to
give
showed
a
*NL*
disposition
not
only
to
greet
Silas
and
discuss
his
misfortune
at
some
*NL*
length
when
they
encountered
him
in
the
village
,
but
also
to
take
the
*NL*
trouble
of
calling
at
his
cottage
and
getting
him
to
repeat
all
the
*NL*
details
on
the
very
spot
;
and
then
they
would
try
to
cheer
him
by
*NL*
saying
,
``
Well
,
Master
Marner
,
you
're
no
worse
off
nor
other
poor
folks
,
*NL*
after
all
;
and
if
you
was
to
be
crippled
,
the
parish
`
ud
give
you
a
*NL*
`
lowance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
one
reason
why
we
are
seldom
able
to
comfort
our
neighbours
*NL*
with
our
words
is
that
our
goodwill
gets
adulterated
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
ourselves
,
before
it
can
pass
our
lips
.
We
can
send
black
puddings
and
*NL*
pettitoes
without
giving
them
a
flavour
of
our
own
egoism
;
but
language
*NL*
is
a
stream
that
is
almost
sure
to
smack
of
a
mingled
soil
.
There
was
*NL*
a
fair
proportion
of
kindness
in
Raveloe
;
but
it
was
often
of
a
beery
*NL*
and
bungling
sort
,
and
took
the
shape
least
allied
to
the
complimentary
*NL*
and
hypocritical
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Macey
,
for
example
,
coming
one
evening
expressly
to
let
Silas
know
*NL*
that
recent
events
had
given
him
the
advantage
of
standing
more
*NL*
favourably
in
the
opinion
of
a
man
whose
judgment
was
not
formed
*NL*
lightly
,
opened
the
conversation
by
saying
,
as
soon
as
he
had
seated
*NL*
himself
and
adjusted
his
thumbs
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Master
Marner
,
why
,
you
've
no
call
to
sit
a-moaning
.
You
're
a
*NL*
deal
better
off
to
ha
'
lost
your
money
,
nor
to
ha
'
kep
it
by
foul
*NL*
means
.
I
used
to
think
,
when
you
first
come
into
these
parts
,
as
you
*NL*
were
no
better
nor
you
should
be
;
you
were
younger
a
deal
than
what
you
*NL*
are
now
;
but
you
were
allays
a
staring
,
white-faced
creatur
,
partly
*NL*
like
a
bald-faced
calf
,
as
I
may
say
.
But
there
's
no
knowing
:
it
is
n't
*NL*
every
queer-looksed
thing
as
Old
Harry
's
had
the
making
of
--
I
mean
,
*NL*
speaking
o
'
toads
and
such
;
for
they
're
often
harmless
,
like
,
and
*NL*
useful
against
varmin
.
And
it
's
pretty
much
the
same
wi
'
you
,
as
fur
*NL*
as
I
can
see
.
Though
as
to
the
yarbs
and
stuff
to
cure
the
breathing
,
*NL*
if
you
brought
that
sort
o
'
knowledge
from
distant
parts
,
you
might
ha
'
*NL*
been
a
bit
freer
of
it
.
And
if
the
knowledge
was
n't
well
come
by
,
why
,
*NL*
you
might
ha
'
made
up
for
it
by
coming
to
church
reg
`
lar
;
for
,
as
for
*NL*
the
children
as
the
Wise
Woman
charmed
,
I
've
been
at
the
christening
of
*NL*
'em
again
and
again
,
and
they
took
the
water
just
as
well
.
And
that
's
*NL*
reasonable
;
for
if
Old
Harry
's
a
mind
to
do
a
bit
o
'
kindness
for
a
*NL*
holiday
,
like
,
who
's
got
anything
against
it
?
That
's
my
thinking
;
and
*NL*
I
've
been
clerk
o
'
this
parish
forty
year
,
and
I
know
,
when
the
parson
*NL*
and
me
does
the
cussing
of
a
Ash
Wednesday
,
there
's
no
cussing
o
'
folks
*NL*
as
have
a
mind
to
be
cured
without
a
doctor
,
let
Kimble
say
what
he
*NL*
will
.
And
so
,
Master
Marner
,
as
I
was
saying
--
for
there
's
windings
i
'
*NL*
things
as
they
may
carry
you
to
the
fur
end
o
'
the
prayer-book
afore
*NL*
you
get
back
to
'em
--
my
advice
is
,
as
you
keep
up
your
sperrits
;
for
as
*NL*
for
thinking
you
're
a
deep
un
,
and
ha
'
got
more
inside
you
nor
`
ull
*NL*
bear
daylight
,
I
'm
not
o
'
that
opinion
at
all
,
and
so
I
tell
the
*NL*
neighbours
.
For
,
says
I
,
you
talk
o
'
Master
Marner
making
out
a
*NL*
tale
--
why
,
it
's
nonsense
,
that
is
:
it
`
ud
take
a
`
cute
man
to
make
a
*NL*
tale
like
that
;
and
,
says
I
,
he
looked
as
scared
as
a
rabbit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
discursive
address
Silas
had
continued
motionless
in
his
*NL*
previous
attitude
,
leaning
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
and
pressing
his
*NL*
hands
against
his
head
.
Mr.
Macey
,
not
doubting
that
he
had
been
*NL*
listened
to
,
paused
,
in
the
expectation
of
some
appreciatory
reply
,
but
*NL*
Marner
remained
silent
.
He
had
a
sense
that
the
old
man
meant
to
be
*NL*
good-natured
and
neighbourly
;
but
the
kindness
fell
on
him
as
sunshine
*NL*
falls
on
the
wretched
--
he
had
no
heart
to
taste
it
,
and
felt
that
it
*NL*
was
very
far
off
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Master
Marner
,
have
you
got
nothing
to
say
to
that
?
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Macey
at
last
,
with
a
slight
accent
of
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Marner
,
slowly
,
shaking
his
head
between
his
hands
,
``
I
thank
*NL*
you
--
thank
you
--
kindly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
to
be
sure
:
I
thought
you
would
,
''
said
Mr.
Macey
;
``
and
my
*NL*
advice
is
--
have
you
got
a
Sunday
suit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Marner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubted
it
was
so
,
''
said
Mr.
Macey
.
``
Now
,
let
me
advise
you
to
get
*NL*
a
Sunday
suit
:
there
's
Tookey
,
he
's
a
poor
creatur
,
but
he
's
got
my
*NL*
tailoring
business
,
and
some
o
'
my
money
in
it
,
and
he
shall
make
a
*NL*
suit
at
a
low
price
,
and
give
you
trust
,
and
then
you
can
come
to
*NL*
church
,
and
be
a
bit
neighbourly
.
Why
,
you
've
never
heared
me
say
*NL*
``
Amen
''
since
you
come
into
these
parts
,
and
I
recommend
you
to
lose
no
*NL*
time
,
for
it
'll
be
poor
work
when
Tookey
has
it
all
to
himself
,
for
I
*NL*
may
n't
be
equil
to
stand
i
'
the
desk
at
all
,
come
another
winter
.
''
*NL*
Here
Mr.
Macey
paused
,
perhaps
expecting
some
sign
of
emotion
in
his
*NL*
hearer
;
but
not
observing
any
,
he
went
on
.
``
And
as
for
the
money
for
*NL*
the
suit
o
'
clothes
,
why
,
you
get
a
matter
of
a
pound
a-week
at
your
*NL*
weaving
,
Master
Marner
,
and
you
're
a
young
man
,
eh
,
for
all
you
look
so
*NL*
mushed
.
Why
,
you
could
n't
ha
'
been
five-and-twenty
when
you
come
into
*NL*
these
parts
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
started
a
little
at
the
change
to
a
questioning
tone
,
and
*NL*
answered
mildly
,
``
I
do
n't
know
;
I
ca
n't
rightly
say
--
it
's
a
long
while
*NL*
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
receiving
such
an
answer
as
this
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
Mr.
*NL*
Macey
observed
,
later
on
in
the
evening
at
the
Rainbow
,
that
Marner
's
*NL*
head
was
``
all
of
a
muddle
''
,
and
that
it
was
to
be
doubted
if
he
ever
*NL*
knew
when
Sunday
came
round
,
which
showed
him
a
worse
heathen
than
many
*NL*
a
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
of
Silas
's
comforters
,
besides
Mr.
Macey
,
came
to
him
with
a
*NL*
mind
highly
charged
on
the
same
topic
.
This
was
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
the
*NL*
wheelwright
's
wife
.
The
inhabitants
of
Raveloe
were
not
severely
*NL*
regular
in
their
church-going
,
and
perhaps
there
was
hardly
a
person
in
*NL*
the
parish
who
would
not
have
held
that
to
go
to
church
every
Sunday
in
*NL*
the
calendar
would
have
shown
a
greedy
desire
to
stand
well
with
*NL*
Heaven
,
and
get
an
undue
advantage
over
their
neighbours
--
a
wish
to
be
*NL*
better
than
the
``
common
run
''
,
that
would
have
implied
a
reflection
on
*NL*
those
who
had
had
godfathers
and
godmothers
as
well
as
themselves
,
and
*NL*
had
an
equal
right
to
the
burying-service
.
At
the
same
time
,
it
was
*NL*
understood
to
be
requisite
for
all
who
were
not
household
servants
,
or
*NL*
young
men
,
to
take
the
sacrament
at
one
of
the
great
festivals
:
Squire
*NL*
Cass
himself
took
it
on
Christmas-day
;
while
those
who
were
held
to
be
*NL*
``
good
livers
''
went
to
church
with
greater
,
though
still
with
moderate
,
*NL*
frequency
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Winthrop
was
one
of
these
:
she
was
in
all
respects
a
woman
of
*NL*
scrupulous
conscience
,
so
eager
for
duties
that
life
seemed
to
offer
*NL*
them
too
scantily
unless
she
rose
at
half-past
four
,
though
this
threw
*NL*
a
scarcity
of
work
over
the
more
advanced
hours
of
the
morning
,
which
*NL*
it
was
a
constant
problem
with
her
to
remove
.
Yet
she
had
not
the
*NL*
vixenish
temper
which
is
sometimes
supposed
to
be
a
necessary
condition
*NL*
of
such
habits
:
she
was
a
very
mild
,
patient
woman
,
whose
nature
it
was
*NL*
to
seek
out
all
the
sadder
and
more
serious
elements
of
life
,
and
*NL*
pasture
her
mind
upon
them
.
She
was
the
person
always
first
thought
of
*NL*
in
Raveloe
when
there
was
illness
or
death
in
a
family
,
when
leeches
*NL*
were
to
be
applied
,
or
there
was
a
sudden
disappointment
in
a
monthly
*NL*
nurse
.
She
was
a
``
comfortable
woman
''
--
good-looking
,
*NL*
fresh-complexioned
,
having
her
lips
always
slightly
screwed
,
as
if
she
*NL*
felt
herself
in
a
sick-room
with
the
doctor
or
the
clergyman
present
.
*NL*
But
she
was
never
whimpering
;
no
one
had
seen
her
shed
tears
;
she
was
*NL*
simply
grave
and
inclined
to
shake
her
head
and
sigh
,
almost
*NL*
imperceptibly
,
like
a
funereal
mourner
who
is
not
a
relation
.
It
*NL*
seemed
surprising
that
Ben
Winthrop
,
who
loved
his
quart-pot
and
his
*NL*
joke
,
got
along
so
well
with
Dolly
;
but
she
took
her
husband
's
jokes
*NL*
and
joviality
as
patiently
as
everything
else
,
considering
that
``
men
*NL*
_
would
_
be
so
''
,
and
viewing
the
stronger
sex
in
the
light
of
animals
*NL*
whom
it
had
pleased
Heaven
to
make
naturally
troublesome
,
like
bulls
*NL*
and
turkey-cocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
good
wholesome
woman
could
hardly
fail
to
have
her
mind
drawn
*NL*
strongly
towards
Silas
Marner
,
now
that
he
appeared
in
the
light
of
a
*NL*
sufferer
;
and
one
Sunday
afternoon
she
took
her
little
boy
Aaron
with
*NL*
her
,
and
went
to
call
on
Silas
,
carrying
in
her
hand
some
small
*NL*
lard-cakes
,
flat
paste-like
articles
much
esteemed
in
Raveloe
.
Aaron
,
*NL*
an
apple-cheeked
youngster
of
seven
,
with
a
clean
starched
frill
which
*NL*
looked
like
a
plate
for
the
apples
,
needed
all
his
adventurous
*NL*
curiosity
to
embolden
him
against
the
possibility
that
the
big-eyed
*NL*
weaver
might
do
him
some
bodily
injury
;
and
his
dubiety
was
much
*NL*
increased
when
,
on
arriving
at
the
Stone-pits
,
they
heard
the
*NL*
mysterious
sound
of
the
loom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
is
as
I
thought
,
''
said
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
to
knock
loudly
before
Silas
heard
them
;
but
when
he
did
come
*NL*
to
the
door
he
showed
no
impatience
,
as
he
would
once
have
done
,
at
a
*NL*
visit
that
had
been
unasked
for
and
unexpected
.
Formerly
,
his
heart
had
*NL*
been
as
a
locked
casket
with
its
treasure
inside
;
but
now
the
casket
*NL*
was
empty
,
and
the
lock
was
broken
.
Left
groping
in
darkness
,
with
his
*NL*
prop
utterly
gone
,
Silas
had
inevitably
a
sense
,
though
a
dull
and
*NL*
half-despairing
one
,
that
if
any
help
came
to
him
it
must
come
from
*NL*
without
;
and
there
was
a
slight
stirring
of
expectation
at
the
sight
of
*NL*
his
fellow-men
,
a
faint
consciousness
of
dependence
on
their
goodwill
.
*NL*
He
opened
the
door
wide
to
admit
Dolly
,
but
without
otherwise
returning
*NL*
her
greeting
than
by
moving
the
armchair
a
few
inches
as
a
sign
that
*NL*
she
was
to
sit
down
in
it
.
Dolly
,
as
soon
as
she
was
seated
,
removed
*NL*
the
white
cloth
that
covered
her
lard-cakes
,
and
said
in
her
gravest
*NL*
way
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
a
baking
yisterday
,
Master
Marner
,
and
the
lard-cakes
turned
out
*NL*
better
nor
common
,
and
I
'd
ha
'
asked
you
to
accept
some
,
if
you
'd
*NL*
thought
well
.
I
do
n't
eat
such
things
myself
,
for
a
bit
o
'
bread
's
*NL*
what
I
like
from
one
year
's
end
to
the
other
;
but
men
's
stomichs
are
*NL*
made
so
comical
,
they
want
a
change
--
they
do
,
I
know
,
God
help
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
sighed
gently
as
she
held
out
the
cakes
to
Silas
,
who
thanked
her
*NL*
kindly
and
looked
very
close
at
them
,
absently
,
being
accustomed
to
*NL*
look
so
at
everything
he
took
into
his
hand
--
eyed
all
the
while
by
the
*NL*
wondering
bright
orbs
of
the
small
Aaron
,
who
had
made
an
outwork
of
*NL*
his
mother
's
chair
,
and
was
peeping
round
from
behind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
letters
pricked
on
'em
,
''
said
Dolly
.
``
I
ca
n't
read
'em
*NL*
myself
,
and
there
's
nobody
,
not
Mr.
Macey
himself
,
rightly
knows
what
*NL*
they
mean
;
but
they
've
a
good
meaning
,
for
they
're
the
same
as
is
on
*NL*
the
pulpit-cloth
at
church
.
What
are
they
,
Aaron
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aaron
retreated
completely
behind
his
outwork
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
go
,
that
's
naughty
,
''
said
his
mother
,
mildly
.
``
Well
,
whativer
the
*NL*
letters
are
,
they
've
a
good
meaning
;
and
it
's
a
stamp
as
has
been
in
*NL*
our
house
,
Ben
says
,
ever
since
he
was
a
little
un
,
and
his
mother
used
*NL*
to
put
it
on
the
cakes
,
and
I
've
allays
put
it
on
too
;
for
if
there
's
*NL*
any
good
,
we
've
need
of
it
i
'
this
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
I.
H.
S.
,
''
said
Silas
,
at
which
proof
of
learning
Aaron
peeped
*NL*
round
the
chair
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
be
sure
,
you
can
read
'em
off
,
''
said
Dolly
.
``
Ben
's
read
'em
*NL*
to
me
many
and
many
a
time
,
but
they
slip
out
o
'
my
mind
again
;
the
*NL*
more
's
the
pity
,
for
they
're
good
letters
,
else
they
would
n't
be
in
the
*NL*
church
;
and
so
I
prick
'em
on
all
the
loaves
and
all
the
cakes
,
though
*NL*
sometimes
they
wo
n't
hold
,
because
o
'
the
rising
--
for
,
as
I
said
,
if
*NL*
there
's
any
good
to
be
got
we
've
need
of
it
i
'
this
world
--
that
we
*NL*
have
;
and
I
hope
they
'll
bring
good
to
you
,
Master
Marner
,
for
it
's
wi
'
*NL*
that
will
I
brought
you
the
cakes
;
and
you
see
the
letters
have
held
*NL*
better
nor
common
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
was
as
unable
to
interpret
the
letters
as
Dolly
,
but
there
was
no
*NL*
possibility
of
misunderstanding
the
desire
to
give
comfort
that
made
*NL*
itself
heard
in
her
quiet
tones
.
He
said
,
with
more
feeling
than
*NL*
before
--
``
Thank
you
--
thank
you
kindly
.
''
But
he
laid
down
the
cakes
and
*NL*
seated
himself
absently
--
drearily
unconscious
of
any
distinct
benefit
*NL*
towards
which
the
cakes
and
the
letters
,
or
even
Dolly
's
kindness
,
*NL*
could
tend
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
if
there
's
good
anywhere
,
we
've
need
of
it
,
''
repeated
Dolly
,
who
*NL*
did
not
lightly
forsake
a
serviceable
phrase
.
She
looked
at
Silas
*NL*
pityingly
as
she
went
on
.
``
But
you
did
n't
hear
the
church-bells
this
*NL*
morning
,
Master
Marner
?
I
doubt
you
did
n't
know
it
was
Sunday
.
Living
*NL*
so
lone
here
,
you
lose
your
count
,
I
daresay
;
and
then
,
when
your
loom
*NL*
makes
a
noise
,
you
ca
n't
hear
the
bells
,
more
partic
`
lar
now
the
frost
*NL*
kills
the
sound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
;
I
heard
'em
,
''
said
Silas
,
to
whom
Sunday
bells
were
a
mere
*NL*
accident
of
the
day
,
and
not
part
of
its
sacredness
.
There
had
been
no
*NL*
bells
in
Lantern
Yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
heart
!
''
said
Dolly
,
pausing
before
she
spoke
again
.
``
But
what
a
*NL*
pity
it
is
you
should
work
of
a
Sunday
,
and
not
clean
yourself
--
if
you
*NL*
_
did
n't
_
go
to
church
;
for
if
you
'd
a
roasting
bit
,
it
might
be
as
you
*NL*
could
n't
leave
it
,
being
a
lone
man
.
But
there
's
the
bakehus
,
if
you
*NL*
could
make
up
your
mind
to
spend
a
twopence
on
the
oven
now
and
*NL*
then
,
--
not
every
week
,
in

--
I
should
n't
like
to
do
that
*NL*
myself
,
--
you
might
carry
your
bit
o

dinner
there
,
for
it
's
nothing
but
*NL*
right
to
have
a
bit
o

summat
hot
of
a
Sunday
,
and
not
to
make
it

But
now
,
upo

Christmas-day
,
*NL*
this
blessed
Christmas
as
is
ever
coming
,
if
you
was
to
take
your
*NL*
dinner
to
the
bakehus

go
to
church
,
and
see
the
holly
and
the
yew
,
*NL*
and
hear
the
anthim
,
and
then
take
the
sacramen
'
,
you
'd
be
a
deal
the
*NL*
better
,
and
you
'd
know
which
end
you
stood
on
,
and
you
could
put
your
*NL*
trust
i

Them
as

it
*NL*
lies
on

all
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
's
exhortation
,
which
was
an
unusually
long
effort
of
speech
for
*NL*
her
,
was
uttered
in
the
soothing
persuasive
tone
with
which
she
would
*NL*
have
tried
to
prevail
on
a
sick
man
to
take
his
medicine
,
or
a
basin
of
*NL*
gruel
for
which
he
had
no
appetite
.
Silas
had
never
before
been
*NL*
closely
urged
on
the
point
of
his
absence
from
church
,
which
had
only
*NL*
been
thought
of
as
a
part
of
his
general
queerness
;
and
he
was
too
*NL*
direct
and
simple
to
evade
Dolly
's
appeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
know
nothing
o
'
church
.
I
've
never
been
to
*NL*
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
Dolly
,
in
a
low
tone
of
wonderment
.
Then
bethinking
*NL*
herself
of
Silas
's
advent
from
an
unknown
country
,
she
said
,
``
Could
it
*NL*
ha
'
been
as
they
'd
no
church
where
you
was
born
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Silas
,
meditatively
,
sitting
in
his
usual
posture
of
*NL*
leaning
on
his
knees
,
and
supporting
his
head
.
``
There
was
churches
--
a
*NL*
many
--
it
was
a
big
town
.
But
I
knew
nothing
of
'em
--
I
went
to
chapel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
was
much
puzzled
at
this
new
word
,
but
she
was
rather
afraid
of
*NL*
inquiring
further
,
lest
``
chapel
''
might
mean
some
haunt
of
wickedness
.
*NL*
After
a
little
thought
,
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Master
Marner
,
it
's
niver
too
late
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
,
and
*NL*
if
you
've
niver
had
no
church
,
there
's
no
telling
the
good
it
'll
do
*NL*
you
.
For
I
feel
so
set
up
and
comfortable
as
niver
was
,
when
I
've
been
*NL*
and
heard
the
prayers
,
and
the
singing
to
the
praise
and
glory
o

God

*NL*
as
Mr.
Macey
gives
out
--
and
Mr.
Crackenthorp
saying
good
words

and
*NL*
more
partic
`
lar
on
Sacramen

Day
;
and
if
a
bit
o

trouble
comes
,
I
feel
*NL*
as
I
can
put
up

myself
up

and
if

it
is
n't
to
be
believed
as
Them
as

''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Dolly
's
exposition
of
her
simple
Raveloe
theology
fell
rather
*NL*
unmeaningly
on
Silas
's
ears
,
for
there
was
no
word
in
it
that
could
*NL*
rouse
a
memory
of
what
he
had
known
as
religion
,
and
his
comprehension
*NL*
was
quite
baffled
by
the
plural
pronoun
,
which
was
no
heresy
of
*NL*
Dolly
's
,
but
only
her
way
of
avoiding
a
presumptuous
familiarity
.
He
*NL*
remained
silent
,
not
feeling
inclined
to
assent
to
the
part
of
Dolly
's
*NL*
speech
which
he
fully
understood
--
her
recommendation
that
he
should
go
*NL*
to
church
.
Indeed
,
Silas
was
so
unaccustomed
to
talk
beyond
the
brief
*NL*
questions
and
answers
necessary
for
the
transaction
of
his
simple
*NL*
business
,
that
words
did
not
easily
come
to
him
without
the
urgency
of
*NL*
a
distinct
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
,
little
Aaron
,
having
become
used
to
the
weaver
's
awful
*NL*
presence
,
had
advanced
to
his
mother
's
side
,
and
Silas
,
seeming
to
*NL*
notice
him
for
the
first
time
,
tried
to
return
Dolly
's
signs
of
*NL*
good-will
by
offering
the
lad
a
bit
of
lard-cake
.
Aaron
shrank
back
a
*NL*
little
,
and
rubbed
his
head
against
his
mother
's
shoulder
,
but
still
*NL*
thought
the
piece
of
cake
worth
the
risk
of
putting
his
hand
out
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
for
shame
,
Aaron
,
''
said
his
mother
,
taking
him
on
her
lap
,
*NL*
however
;
``
why
,
you
do
n't
want
cake
again
yet
awhile
.
He
's
wonderful
*NL*
hearty
,
''
she
went
on
,
with
a
little
sigh
--
``
that
he
is
,
God
knows
.
He
's
*NL*
my
youngest
,
and
we
spoil
him
sadly
,
for
either
me

the
father

*NL*
allays
hev
him
in
our
sight

that
we
must

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stroked
Aaron
's
brown
head
,
and
thought
it
must
do
Master
Marner
*NL*
good
to
see
such
a
``
pictur
of
a
child
''
.
But
Marner
,
on
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
hearth
,
saw
the
neat-featured
rosy
face
as
a
mere
dim
round
,
*NL*
with
two
dark
spots
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
's
got
a
voice
like
a
bird
--
you
would
n't
think

Dolly
went
on
;
*NL*
``
he
can
sing
a
Christmas
carril
as
his
father
's
taught
him
;
and
I
take
*NL*
it
for
a
token
as
he
'll
come
to
good
,
as
he
can
learn
the
good
tunes
so
*NL*
quick
.
Come

Aaron
,
stan

up
and
sing
the
carril
to
Master
Marner

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Aaron
replied
by
rubbing
his
forehead
against
his
mother
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
naughty

''
said
Dolly
,
gently
.
``
Stan
'
up
,
when
mother
tells
*NL*
you
,
and
let
me
hold
the
cake
till
you
've
done

''
*NL*
*NL*
Aaron
was
not
indisposed
to
display
his
talents
,
even
to
an
ogre
,
under
*NL*
protecting
circumstances
;
and
after
a
few
more
signs
of
coyness
,
*NL*
consisting
chiefly
in
rubbing
the
backs
of
his
hands
over
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
then
peeping
between
them
at
Master
Marner
,
to
see
if
he
looked
anxious
*NL*
for
the
``
carril
''
,
he
at
length
allowed
his
head
to
be
duly
adjusted
,
*NL*
and
standing
behind
the
table
,
which
let
him
appear
above
it
only
as
*NL*
far
as
his
broad
frill
,
so
that
he
looked
like
a
cherubic
head
*NL*
untroubled
with
a
body
,
he
began
with
a
clear
chirp
,
and
in
a
melody
*NL*
that
had
the
rhythm
of
an
industrious
hammer
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
rest
you
,
merry
gentlemen

*NL*
Let
nothing
you
dismay

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
listened
with
a
devout
look
,
glancing
at
Marner
in
some
*NL*
confidence
that
this
strain
would
help
to
allure
him
to
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Christmas
music
,
''
she
said
,
when
Aaron
had
ended
,
and
had
*NL*
secured
his
piece
of
cake
again
.
``
There
's
no
other
music
equil
to
the
*NL*
Christmas
music
--
``
Hark
the
erol
angils
sing
.
''
And
you
may
judge
what
*NL*
it
is
at
church
,
Master
Marner
,
with
the
bassoon
and
the
voices
,
as
you
*NL*
ca
n't
help
thinking
you
've
got
to
a
better
place
a
`
ready
--
for
I
*NL*
would
n't
speak
ill
o
'
this
world
,
seeing
as
Them
put
us
in
it
as
knows
*NL*
best
--
but
what
wi
'
the
drink
,
and
the
quarrelling
,
and
the
bad
*NL*
illnesses
,
and
the
hard
dying
,
as
I
've
seen
times
and
times
,
one
's
*NL*
thankful
to
hear
of
a
better
.
The
boy
sings
pretty
,
do
n't
he
,
Master
*NL*
Marner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Silas
,
absently
,
``
very
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Christmas
carol
,
with
its
hammer-like
rhythm
,
had
fallen
on
his
*NL*
ears
as
strange
music
,
quite
unlike
a
hymn
,
and
could
have
none
of
the
*NL*
effect
Dolly
contemplated
.
But
he
wanted
to
show
her
that
he
was
*NL*
grateful
,
and
the
only
mode
that
occurred
to
him
was
to
offer
Aaron
a
*NL*
bit
more
cake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
thank
you
,
Master
Marner
,
''
said
Dolly
,
holding
down
Aaron
's
*NL*
willing
hands
.
``
We
must
be
going
home
now
.
And
so
I
wish
you
*NL*
good-bye
,
Master
Marner
;
and
if
you
ever
feel
anyways
bad
in
your
*NL*
inside
,
as
you
ca
n't
fend
for
yourself
,
I
'll
come
and
clean
up
for
you
,
*NL*
and
get
you
a
bit
o
'
victual
,
and
willing
.
But
I
beg
and
pray
of
you
*NL*
to
leave
off
weaving
of
a
Sunday
,
for
it
's
bad
for
soul
and
body
--
and
*NL*
the
money
as
comes
i
'
that
way
`
ull
be
a
bad
bed
to
lie
down
on
at
the
*NL*
last
,
if
it
does
n't
fly
away
,
nobody
knows
where
,
like
the
white
frost
.
*NL*
And
you
'll
excuse
me
being
that
free
with
you
,
Master
Marner
,
for
I
*NL*
wish
you
well
--
I
do
.
Make
your
bow
,
Aaron
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
said
``
Good-bye
,
and
thank
you
kindly
,
''
as
he
opened
the
door
for
*NL*
Dolly
,
but
he
could
n't
help
feeling
relieved
when
she
was
*NL*
gone
--
relieved
that
he
might
weave
again
and
moan
at
his
ease
.
Her
*NL*
simple
view
of
life
and
its
comforts
,
by
which
she
had
tried
to
cheer
*NL*
him
,
was
only
like
a
report
of
unknown
objects
,
which
his
imagination
*NL*
could
not
fashion
.
The
fountains
of
human
love
and
of
faith
in
a
*NL*
divine
love
had
not
yet
been
unlocked
,
and
his
soul
was
still
the
*NL*
shrunken
rivulet
,
with
only
this
difference
,
that
its
little
groove
of
*NL*
sand
was
blocked
up
,
and
it
wandered
confusedly
against
dark
*NL*
obstruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
notwithstanding
the
honest
persuasions
of
Mr.
Macey
and
Dolly
*NL*
Winthrop
,
Silas
spent
his
Christmas-day
in
loneliness
,
eating
his
meat
*NL*
in
sadness
of
heart
,
though
the
meat
had
come
to
him
as
a
neighbourly
*NL*
present
.
In
the
morning
he
looked
out
on
the
black
frost
that
seemed
*NL*
to
press
cruelly
on
every
blade
of
grass
,
while
the
half-icy
red
pool
*NL*
shivered
under
the
bitter
wind
;
but
towards
evening
the
snow
began
to
*NL*
fall
,
and
curtained
from
him
even
that
dreary
outlook
,
shutting
him
*NL*
close
up
with
his
narrow
grief
.
And
he
sat
in
his
robbed
home
through
*NL*
the
livelong
evening
,
not
caring
to
close
his
shutters
or
lock
his
*NL*
door
,
pressing
his
head
between
his
hands
and
moaning
,
till
the
cold
*NL*
grasped
him
and
told
him
that
his
fire
was
grey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
in
this
world
but
himself
knew
that
he
was
the
same
Silas
Marner
*NL*
who
had
once
loved
his
fellow
with
tender
love
,
and
trusted
in
an
*NL*
unseen
goodness
.
Even
to
himself
that
past
experience
had
become
dim
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
Raveloe
village
the
bells
rang
merrily
,
and
the
church
was
*NL*
fuller
than
all
through
the
rest
of
the
year
,
with
red
faces
among
the
*NL*
abundant
dark-green
boughs
--
faces
prepared
for
a
longer
service
than
*NL*
usual
by
an
odorous
breakfast
of
toast
and
ale
.
Those
green
boughs
,
*NL*
the
hymn
and
anthem
never
heard
but
at
Christmas
--
even
the
Athanasian
*NL*
Creed
,
which
was
discriminated
from
the
others
only
as
being
longer
and
*NL*
of
exceptional
virtue
,
since
it
was
only
read
on
rare
*NL*
occasions
--
brought
a
vague
exulting
sense
,
for
which
the
grown
men
*NL*
could
as
little
have
found
words
as
the
children
,
that
something
great
*NL*
and
mysterious
had
been
done
for
them
in
heaven
above
and
in
earth
*NL*
below
,
which
they
were
appropriating
by
their
presence
.
And
then
the
*NL*
red
faces
made
their
way
through
the
black
biting
frost
to
their
own
*NL*
homes
,
feeling
themselves
free
for
the
rest
of
the
day
to
eat
,
drink
,
*NL*
and
be
merry
,
and
using
that
Christian
freedom
without
diffidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Squire
Cass
's
family
party
that
day
nobody
mentioned
Dunstan
--
nobody
*NL*
was
sorry
for
his
absence
,
or
feared
it
would
be
too
long
.
The
doctor
*NL*
and
his
wife
,
uncle
and
aunt
Kimble
,
were
there
,
and
the
annual
*NL*
Christmas
talk
was
carried
through
without
any
omissions
,
rising
to
the
*NL*
climax
of
Mr.
Kimble
's
experience
when
he
walked
the
London
hospitals
*NL*
thirty
years
back
,
together
with
striking
professional
anecdotes
then
*NL*
gathered
.
Whereupon
cards
followed
,
with
aunt
Kimble
's
annual
failure
*NL*
to
follow
suit
,
and
uncle
Kimble
's
irascibility
concerning
the
odd
*NL*
trick
which
was
rarely
explicable
to
him
,
when
it
was
not
on
his
side
,
*NL*
without
a
general
visitation
of
tricks
to
see
that
they
were
formed
on
*NL*
sound
principles
:
the
whole
being
accompanied
by
a
strong
steaming
*NL*
odour
of
spirits-and-water
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
party
on
Christmas-day
,
being
a
strictly
family
party
,
was
not
*NL*
the
pre-eminently
brilliant
celebration
of
the
season
at
the
Red
House
.
*NL*
It
was
the
great
dance
on
New
Year
's
Eve
that
made
the
glory
of
Squire
*NL*
Cass
's
hospitality
,
as
of
his
forefathers
'
,
time
out
of
mind
.
This
was
*NL*
the
occasion
when
all
the
society
of
Raveloe
and
Tarley
,
whether
old
*NL*
acquaintances
separated
by
long
rutty
distances
,
or
cooled
*NL*
acquaintances
separated
by
misunderstandings
concerning
runaway
calves
,
*NL*
or
acquaintances
founded
on
intermittent
condescension
,
counted
on
*NL*
meeting
and
on
comporting
themselves
with
mutual
appropriateness
.
This
*NL*
was
the
occasion
on
which
fair
dames
who
came
on
pillions
sent
their
*NL*
bandboxes
before
them
,
supplied
with
more
than
their
evening
costume
;
*NL*
for
the
feast
was
not
to
end
with
a
single
evening
,
like
a
paltry
town
*NL*
entertainment
,
where
the
whole
supply
of
eatables
is
put
on
the
table
*NL*
at
once
,
and
bedding
is
scanty
.
The
Red
House
was
provisioned
as
if
*NL*
for
a
siege
;
and
as
for
the
spare
feather-beds
ready
to
be
laid
on
*NL*
floors
,
they
were
as
plentiful
as
might
naturally
be
expected
in
a
*NL*
family
that
had
killed
its
own
geese
for
many
generations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
Cass
was
looking
forward
to
this
New
Year
's
Eve
with
a
foolish
*NL*
reckless
longing
,
that
made
him
half
deaf
to
his
importunate
companion
,
*NL*
Anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dunsey
will
be
coming
home
soon
:
there
will
be
a
great
blow-up
,
and
*NL*
how
will
you
bribe
his
spite
to
silence
?
''
said
Anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
wo
n't
come
home
before
New
Year
's
Eve
,
perhaps
,
''
said
Godfrey
;
*NL*
``
and
I
shall
sit
by
Nancy
then
,
and
dance
with
her
,
and
get
a
kind
look
*NL*
from
her
in
spite
of
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
money
is
wanted
in
another
quarter
,
''
said
Anxiety
,
in
a
louder
*NL*
voice
,
``
and
how
will
you
get
it
without
selling
your
mother
's
diamond
*NL*
pin
?
And
if
you
do
n't
get
it
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
something
may
happen
to
make
things
easier
.
At
any
rate
,
*NL*
there
's
one
pleasure
for
me
close
at
hand
:
Nancy
is
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
suppose
your
father
should
bring
matters
to
a
pass
that
will
*NL*
oblige
you
to
decline
marrying
her
--
and
to
give
your
reasons
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
,
and
do
n't
worry
me
.
I
can
see
Nancy
's
eyes
,
just
as
*NL*
they
will
look
at
me
,
and
feel
her
hand
in
mine
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Anxiety
went
on
,
though
in
noisy
Christmas
company
;
refusing
to
be
*NL*
utterly
quieted
even
by
much
drinking
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Some
women
,
I
grant
,
would
not
appear
to
advantage
seated
on
a
pillion
,
*NL*
and
attired
in
a
drab
joseph
and
a
drab
beaver-bonnet
,
with
a
crown
*NL*
resembling
a
small
stew-pan
;
for
a
garment
suggesting
a
coachman
's
*NL*
greatcoat
,
cut
out
under
an
exiguity
of
cloth
that
would
only
allow
of
*NL*
miniature
capes
,
is
not
well
adapted
to
conceal
deficiencies
of
*NL*
contour
,
nor
is
drab
a
colour
that
will
throw
sallow
cheeks
into
lively
*NL*
contrast
.
It
was
all
the
greater
triumph
to
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
's
*NL*
beauty
that
she
looked
thoroughly
bewitching
in
that
costume
,
as
,
*NL*
seated
on
the
pillion
behind
her
tall
,
erect
father
,
she
held
one
arm
*NL*
round
him
,
and
looked
down
,
with
open-eyed
anxiety
,
at
the
treacherous
*NL*
snow-covered
pools
and
puddles
,
which
sent
up
formidable
splashings
of
*NL*
mud
under
the
stamp
of
Dobbin
's
foot
.
A
painter
would
,
perhaps
,
have
*NL*
preferred
her
in
those
moments
when
she
was
free
from
*NL*
self-consciousness
;
but
certainly
the
bloom
on
her
cheeks
was
at
its
*NL*
highest
point
of
contrast
with
the
surrounding
drab
when
she
arrived
at
*NL*
the
door
of
the
Red
House
,
and
saw
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
ready
to
lift
her
*NL*
from
the
pillion
.
She
wished
her
sister
Priscilla
had
come
up
at
the
*NL*
same
time
behind
the
servant
,
for
then
she
would
have
contrived
that
*NL*
Mr.
Godfrey
should
have
lifted
off
Priscilla
first
,
and
,
in
the
*NL*
meantime
,
she
would
have
persuaded
her
father
to
go
round
to
the
*NL*
horse-block
instead
of
alighting
at
the
door-steps
.
It
was
very
*NL*
painful
,
when
you
had
made
it
quite
clear
to
a
young
man
that
you
were
*NL*
determined
not
to
marry
him
,
however
much
he
might
wish
it
,
that
he
*NL*
would
still
continue
to
pay
you
marked
attentions
;
besides
,
why
did
n't
*NL*
he
always
show
the
same
attentions
,
if
he
meant
them
sincerely
,
instead
*NL*
of
being
so
strange
as
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
was
,
sometimes
behaving
as
if
*NL*
he
did
n't
want
to
speak
to
her
,
and
taking
no
notice
of
her
for
weeks
*NL*
and
weeks
,
and
then
,
all
on
a
sudden
,
almost
making
love
again
?
*NL*
Moreover
,
it
was
quite
plain
he
had
no
real
love
for
her
,
else
he
would
*NL*
not
let
people
have
_
that
_
to
say
of
him
which
they
did
say
.
Did
he
*NL*
suppose
that
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
was
to
be
won
by
any
man
,
squire
or
no
*NL*
squire
,
who
led
a
bad
life
?
That
was
not
what
she
had
been
used
to
see
*NL*
in
her
own
father
,
who
was
the
soberest
and
best
man
in
that
*NL*
country-side
,
only
a
little
hot
and
hasty
now
and
then
,
if
things
were
*NL*
not
done
to
the
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
thoughts
rushed
through
Miss
Nancy
's
mind
,
in
their
habitual
*NL*
succession
,
in
the
moments
between
her
first
sight
of
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
*NL*
standing
at
the
door
and
her
own
arrival
there
.
Happily
,
the
Squire
*NL*
came
out
too
and
gave
a
loud
greeting
to
her
father
,
so
that
,
somehow
,
*NL*
under
cover
of
this
noise
she
seemed
to
find
concealment
for
her
*NL*
confusion
and
neglect
of
any
suitably
formal
behaviour
,
while
she
was
*NL*
being
lifted
from
the
pillion
by
strong
arms
which
seemed
to
find
her
*NL*
ridiculously
small
and
light
.
And
there
was
the
best
reason
for
*NL*
hastening
into
the
house
at
once
,
since
the
snow
was
beginning
to
fall
*NL*
again
,
threatening
an
unpleasant
journey
for
such
guests
as
were
still
*NL*
on
the
road
.
These
were
a
small
minority
;
for
already
the
afternoon
*NL*
was
beginning
to
decline
,
and
there
would
not
be
too
much
time
for
the
*NL*
ladies
who
came
from
a
distance
to
attire
themselves
in
readiness
for
*NL*
the
early
tea
which
was
to
inspirit
them
for
the
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
buzz
of
voices
through
the
house
,
as
Miss
Nancy
entered
,
*NL*
mingled
with
the
scrape
of
a
fiddle
preluding
in
the
kitchen
;
but
the
*NL*
Lammeters
were
guests
whose
arrival
had
evidently
been
thought
of
so
*NL*
much
that
it
had
been
watched
for
from
the
windows
,
for
Mrs.
Kimble
,
*NL*
who
did
the
honours
at
the
Red
House
on
these
great
occasions
,
came
*NL*
forward
to
meet
Miss
Nancy
in
the
hall
,
and
conduct
her
up-stairs
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Kimble
was
the
Squire
's
sister
,
as
well
as
the
doctor
's
wife
--
a
*NL*
double
dignity
,
with
which
her
diameter
was
in
direct
proportion
;
so
*NL*
that
,
a
journey
up-stairs
being
rather
fatiguing
to
her
,
she
did
not
*NL*
oppose
Miss
Nancy
's
request
to
be
allowed
to
find
her
way
alone
to
the
*NL*
Blue
Room
,
where
the
Miss
Lammeters
'
bandboxes
had
been
deposited
on
*NL*
their
arrival
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
hardly
a
bedroom
in
the
house
where
feminine
compliments
were
*NL*
not
passing
and
feminine
toilettes
going
forward
,
in
various
stages
,
in
*NL*
space
made
scanty
by
extra
beds
spread
upon
the
floor
;
and
Miss
Nancy
,
*NL*
as
she
entered
the
Blue
Room
,
had
to
make
her
little
formal
curtsy
to
a
*NL*
group
of
six
.
On
the
one
hand
,
there
were
ladies
no
less
important
*NL*
than
the
two
Miss
Gunns
,
the
wine
merchant
's
daughters
from
Lytherly
,
*NL*
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
,
with
the
tightest
skirts
and
the
*NL*
shortest
waists
,
and
gazed
at
by
Miss
Ladbrook
-LRB-
of
the
Old
Pastures
-RRB-
*NL*
with
a
shyness
not
unsustained
by
inward
criticism
.
Partly
,
Miss
*NL*
Ladbrook
felt
that
her
own
skirt
must
be
regarded
as
unduly
lax
by
the
*NL*
Miss
Gunns
,
and
partly
,
that
it
was
a
pity
the
Miss
Gunns
did
not
show
*NL*
that
judgment
which
she
herself
would
show
if
she
were
in
their
place
,
*NL*
by
stopping
a
little
on
this
side
of
the
fashion
.
On
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Ladbrook
was
standing
in
skull-cap
and
front
,
with
her
turban
in
*NL*
her
hand
,
curtsying
and
smiling
blandly
and
saying
,
``
After
you
,
ma'am
,
''
*NL*
to
another
lady
in
similar
circumstances
,
who
had
politely
offered
the
*NL*
precedence
at
the
looking-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Miss
Nancy
had
no
sooner
made
her
curtsy
than
an
elderly
lady
came
*NL*
forward
,
whose
full
white
muslin
kerchief
,
and
mob-cap
round
her
curls
*NL*
of
smooth
grey
hair
,
were
in
daring
contrast
with
the
puffed
yellow
*NL*
satins
and
top-knotted
caps
of
her
neighbours
.
She
approached
Miss
*NL*
Nancy
with
much
primness
,
and
said
,
with
a
slow
,
treble
suavity
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Niece
,
I
hope
I
see
you
well
in
health
.
''
Miss
Nancy
kissed
her
aunt
's
*NL*
cheek
dutifully
,
and
answered
,
with
the
same
sort
of
amiable
primness
,
*NL*
``
Quite
well
,
I
thank
you
,
aunt
;
and
I
hope
I
see
you
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
niece
;
I
keep
my
health
for
the
present
.
And
how
is
my
*NL*
brother-in-law
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
dutiful
questions
and
answers
were
continued
until
it
was
*NL*
ascertained
in
detail
that
the
Lammeters
were
all
as
well
as
usual
,
and
*NL*
the
Osgoods
likewise
,
also
that
niece
Priscilla
must
certainly
arrive
*NL*
shortly
,
and
that
travelling
on
pillions
in
snowy
weather
was
*NL*
unpleasant
,
though
a
joseph
was
a
great
protection
.
Then
Nancy
was
*NL*
formally
introduced
to
her
aunt
's
visitors
,
the
Miss
Gunns
,
as
being
*NL*
the
daughters
of
a
mother
known
to
_
their
_
mother
,
though
now
for
the
*NL*
first
time
induced
to
make
a
journey
into
these
parts
;
and
these
ladies
*NL*
were
so
taken
by
surprise
at
finding
such
a
lovely
face
and
figure
in
*NL*
an
out-of-the-way
country
place
,
that
they
began
to
feel
some
curiosity
*NL*
about
the
dress
she
would
put
on
when
she
took
off
her
joseph
.
Miss
*NL*
Nancy
,
whose
thoughts
were
always
conducted
with
the
propriety
and
*NL*
moderation
conspicuous
in
her
manners
,
remarked
to
herself
that
the
*NL*
Miss
Gunns
were
rather
hard-featured
than
otherwise
,
and
that
such
very
*NL*
low
dresses
as
they
wore
might
have
been
attributed
to
vanity
if
their
*NL*
shoulders
had
been
pretty
,
but
that
,
being
as
they
were
,
it
was
not
*NL*
reasonable
to
suppose
that
they
showed
their
necks
from
a
love
of
*NL*
display
,
but
rather
from
some
obligation
not
inconsistent
with
sense
*NL*
and
modesty
.
She
felt
convinced
,
as
she
opened
her
box
,
that
this
must
*NL*
be
her
aunt
Osgood
's
opinion
,
for
Miss
Nancy
's
mind
resembled
her
*NL*
aunt
's
to
a
degree
that
everybody
said
was
surprising
,
considering
the
*NL*
kinship
was
on
Mr.
Osgood
's
side
;
and
though
you
might
not
have
*NL*
supposed
it
from
the
formality
of
their
greeting
,
there
was
a
devoted
*NL*
attachment
and
mutual
admiration
between
aunt
and
niece
.
Even
Miss
*NL*
Nancy
's
refusal
of
her
cousin
Gilbert
Osgood
-LRB-
on
the
ground
solely
that
*NL*
he
was
her
cousin
-RRB-
,
though
it
had
grieved
her
aunt
greatly
,
had
not
in
*NL*
the
least
cooled
the
preference
which
had
determined
her
to
leave
Nancy
*NL*
several
of
her
hereditary
ornaments
,
let
Gilbert
's
future
wife
be
whom
*NL*
she
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
of
the
ladies
quickly
retired
,
but
the
Miss
Gunns
were
quite
*NL*
content
that
Mrs.
Osgood
's
inclination
to
remain
with
her
niece
gave
*NL*
them
also
a
reason
for
staying
to
see
the
rustic
beauty
's
toilette
.
And
*NL*
it
was
really
a
pleasure
--
from
the
first
opening
of
the
bandbox
,
where
*NL*
everything
smelt
of
lavender
and
rose-leaves
,
to
the
clasping
of
the
*NL*
small
coral
necklace
that
fitted
closely
round
her
little
white
neck
.
*NL*
Everything
belonging
to
Miss
Nancy
was
of
delicate
purity
and
*NL*
nattiness
:
not
a
crease
was
where
it
had
no
business
to
be
,
not
a
bit
*NL*
of
her
linen
professed
whiteness
without
fulfilling
its
profession
;
the
*NL*
very
pins
on
her
pincushion
were
stuck
in
after
a
pattern
from
which
*NL*
she
was
careful
to
allow
no
aberration
;
and
as
for
her
own
person
,
it
*NL*
gave
the
same
idea
of
perfect
unvarying
neatness
as
the
body
of
a
*NL*
little
bird
.
It
is
true
that
her
light-brown
hair
was
cropped
behind
*NL*
like
a
boy
's
,
and
was
dressed
in
front
in
a
number
of
flat
rings
,
that
*NL*
lay
quite
away
from
her
face
;
but
there
was
no
sort
of
coiffure
that
*NL*
could
make
Miss
Nancy
's
cheek
and
neck
look
otherwise
than
pretty
;
and
*NL*
when
at
last
she
stood
complete
in
her
silvery
twilled
silk
,
her
lace
*NL*
tucker
,
her
coral
necklace
,
and
coral
ear-drops
,
the
Miss
Gunns
could
*NL*
see
nothing
to
criticise
except
her
hands
,
which
bore
the
traces
of
*NL*
butter-making
,
cheese-crushing
,
and
even
still
coarser
work
.
But
Miss
*NL*
Nancy
was
not
ashamed
of
that
,
for
even
while
she
was
dressing
she
*NL*
narrated
to
her
aunt
how
she
and
Priscilla
had
packed
their
boxes
*NL*
yesterday
,
because
this
morning
was
baking
morning
,
and
since
they
were
*NL*
leaving
home
,
it
was
desirable
to
make
a
good
supply
of
meat-pies
for
*NL*
the
kitchen
;
and
as
she
concluded
this
judicious
remark
,
she
turned
to
*NL*
the
Miss
Gunns
that
she
might
not
commit
the
rudeness
of
not
including
*NL*
them
in
the
conversation
.
The
Miss
Gunns
smiled
stiffly
,
and
thought
*NL*
what
a
pity
it
was
that
these
rich
country
people
,
who
could
afford
to
*NL*
buy
such
good
clothes
-LRB-
really
Miss
Nancy
's
lace
and
silk
were
very
*NL*
costly
-RRB-
,
should
be
brought
up
in
utter
ignorance
and
vulgarity
.
She
*NL*
actually
said
``
mate
''
for
``
meat
''
,
''
`
appen
''
for
``
perhaps
''
,
and
``
oss
''
for
*NL*
``
horse
''
,
which
,
to
young
ladies
living
in
good
Lytherly
society
,
who
*NL*
habitually
said
`
orse
,
even
in
domestic
privacy
,
and
only
said
`
appen
*NL*
on
the
right
occasions
,
was
necessarily
shocking
.
Miss
Nancy
,
indeed
,
*NL*
had
never
been
to
any
school
higher
than
Dame
Tedman
's
:
her
*NL*
acquaintance
with
profane
literature
hardly
went
beyond
the
rhymes
she
*NL*
had
worked
in
her
large
sampler
under
the
lamb
and
the
shepherdess
;
and
*NL*
in
order
to
balance
an
account
,
she
was
obliged
to
effect
her
*NL*
subtraction
by
removing
visible
metallic
shillings
and
sixpences
from
a
*NL*
visible
metallic
total
.
There
is
hardly
a
servant-maid
in
these
days
*NL*
who
is
not
better
informed
than
Miss
Nancy
;
yet
she
had
the
essential
*NL*
attributes
of
a
lady
--
high
veracity
,
delicate
honour
in
her
dealings
,
*NL*
deference
to
others
,
and
refined
personal
habits
,
--
and
lest
these
*NL*
should
not
suffice
to
convince
grammatical
fair
ones
that
her
feelings
*NL*
can
at
all
resemble
theirs
,
I
will
add
that
she
was
slightly
proud
and
*NL*
exacting
,
and
as
constant
in
her
affection
towards
a
baseless
opinion
*NL*
as
towards
an
erring
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
anxiety
about
sister
Priscilla
,
which
had
grown
rather
active
by
*NL*
the
time
the
coral
necklace
was
clasped
,
was
happily
ended
by
the
*NL*
entrance
of
that
cheerful-looking
lady
herself
,
with
a
face
made
blowsy
*NL*
by
cold
and
damp
.
After
the
first
questions
and
greetings
,
she
turned
*NL*
to
Nancy
,
and
surveyed
her
from
head
to
foot
--
then
wheeled
her
round
,
*NL*
to
ascertain
that
the
back
view
was
equally
faultless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
o
'
_
these
_
gowns
,
aunt
Osgood
?
''
said
Priscilla
,
*NL*
while
Nancy
helped
her
to
unrobe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
handsome
indeed
,
niece
,
''
said
Mrs.
Osgood
,
with
a
slight
increase
*NL*
of
formality
.
She
always
thought
niece
Priscilla
too
rough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
obliged
to
have
the
same
as
Nancy
,
you
know
,
for
all
I
'm
five
*NL*
years
older
,
and
it
makes
me
look
yallow
;
for
she
never
_
will
_
have
*NL*
anything
without
I
have
mine
just
like
it
,
because
she
wants
us
to
look
*NL*
like
sisters
.
And
I
tell
her
,
folks
`
ull
think
it
's
my
weakness
makes
*NL*
me
fancy
as
I
shall
look
pretty
in
what
she
looks
pretty
in
.
For
I
*NL*
_
am
_
ugly
--
there
's
no
denying
that
:
I
feature
my
father
's
family
.
But
,
*NL*
law
!
I
do
n't
mind
,
do
you
?
''
Priscilla
here
turned
to
the
Miss
Gunns
,
*NL*
rattling
on
in
too
much
preoccupation
with
the
delight
of
talking
,
to
*NL*
notice
that
her
candour
was
not
appreciated
.
``
The
pretty
uns
do
for
*NL*
fly-catchers
--
they
keep
the
men
off
us
.
I
've
no
opinion
o
'
the
men
,
*NL*
Miss
Gunn
--
I
do
n't
know
what
_
you
_
have
.
And
as
for
fretting
and
*NL*
stewing
about
what
_
they
_
'll
think
of
you
from
morning
till
night
,
and
*NL*
making
your
life
uneasy
about
what
they
're
doing
when
they
're
out
o
'
*NL*
your
sight
--
as
I
tell
Nancy
,
it
's
a
folly
no
woman
need
be
guilty
of
,
*NL*
if
she
's
got
a
good
father
and
a
good
home
:
let
her
leave
it
to
them
as
*NL*
have
got
no
fortin
,
and
ca
n't
help
themselves
.
As
I
say
,
Mr.
*NL*
Have-your-own-way
is
the
best
husband
,
and
the
only
one
I
'd
ever
*NL*
promise
to
obey
.
I
know
it
is
n't
pleasant
,
when
you
've
been
used
to
*NL*
living
in
a
big
way
,
and
managing
hogsheads
and
all
that
,
to
go
and
put
*NL*
your
nose
in
by
somebody
else
's
fireside
,
or
to
sit
down
by
yourself
to
*NL*
a
scrag
or
a
knuckle
;
but
,
thank
God
!
my
father
's
a
sober
man
and
*NL*
likely
to
live
;
and
if
you
've
got
a
man
by
the
chimney-corner
,
it
*NL*
does
n't
matter
if
he
's
childish
--
the
business
need
n't
be
broke
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
delicate
process
of
getting
her
narrow
gown
over
her
head
without
*NL*
injury
to
her
smooth
curls
,
obliged
Miss
Priscilla
to
pause
in
this
*NL*
rapid
survey
of
life
,
and
Mrs.
Osgood
seized
the
opportunity
of
rising
*NL*
and
saying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
niece
,
you
'll
follow
us
.
The
Miss
Gunns
will
like
to
go
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister

''
said
Nancy
,
when
they
were
alone
,
``
you
've
offended
the
Miss
*NL*
Gunns
,
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
done
,
child
?
''
said
Priscilla
,
in
some
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
asked
them
if
they
minded
about
being
ugly
--
you
're
so
very
*NL*
blunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Law
,
did
I
?
Well
,
it
popped
out

it

a

I

a
bad

But
as
for

being
ugly

look
at

child

in
this
silver-coloured
silk

I
told
you

*NL*
``
No

do
n't

I
begged
and
prayed
of
you
not
to
let
us
*NL*
have
this
silk
if
you
'd
like
another
better
.
I
was
willing
to
have
*NL*
_
your

choice

I

said
Nancy
,
in
anxious
self-vindication
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
child
!
you
know
you
'd
set
your
heart
on
this
;
and
reason
*NL*
good

for
you
're
the
colour
o

cream
.
It

be
fine
doings
for
you
to
*NL*
dress
yourself
to
suit
_
my

What
I
find
fault
with
,
is
that
*NL*
notion
o

yours
as
I
must
dress
myself
just

But
you
do
as
you

like
with
me

you
always
did

from
when
first
you
begun
to
walk

you
wanted
to
go
the
field
's
length
,
the
field
's
length
you
'd
go
;
and
*NL*
there
was
no

you

as
a

daisy
all
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Priscy

''
said
Nancy
,
gently
,
as
she
fastened
a
coral
necklace
,
exactly
*NL*
like
her
own
,
round
Priscilla
's
neck
,
which
was
very
far
from
being
*NL*
like
her
own
,
``
I
'm
sure
I
'm
willing

give
way
as
far
as
is
right

*NL*
who
should
n't
dress
alike
if
it
is
n't
sisters
?
Would
you
have
us
go
*NL*
about
looking
as
if
we
were
no
kin
to
one
another
--
us
that
have
got
no
*NL*
mother
and
not
another
sister
in
the
world
?
I
'd
do
what
was
right
,
if
*NL*
I
dressed
in
a
gown
dyed
with
cheese-colouring
;
and
I

rather
you

choose

and
let
me
wear
what
pleases
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you

You

your

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk

so

Priscy

''
said
Nancy
,
blushing
.
``
You
know
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
never
mean
a
fiddlestick
's

''
said
Priscilla
,
as
she
*NL*
arranged
her
discarded
dress
,
and
closed
her
bandbox
.
``
Who
shall
_
I
_
*NL*
have
to
work
for
when
father
's
gone
,
if
you
are
to
go
and
take
notions
*NL*
in
your
head
and
be
an
old
maid

because
some
folks
are
no
better
than
*NL*
they

I
have
n't
a
bit
o

patience
with
you

sitting
on
an
*NL*
addled

as

there
was
never
a

un
in

*NL*
One
old
maid
's
enough
out
o

two

;
and
I
shall
do
credit
to
a
*NL*
single
life

for
God
A'mighty
meant
me
for
it

Come
,
we
can
go
down
*NL*
now

I
'm
as
ready
as

_
can
_
be

there
's
nothing
awanting

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
two
Miss
Lammeters
walked
into
the
large
parlour
together
,
any
*NL*
one
who
did
not
know
the
character
of
both
might
certainly
have
*NL*
supposed
that
the
reason
why
the
square-shouldered
,
clumsy
,
*NL*
high-featured
Priscilla
wore
a
dress
the
facsimile
of
her
pretty
*NL*
sister
's
,
was
either
the
mistaken
vanity
of
the
one
,
or
the
malicious
*NL*
contrivance
of
the
other
in
order
to
set
off
her
own
rare
beauty
.
But
*NL*
the
good-natured
self-forgetful
cheeriness
and
common-sense
of
*NL*
Priscilla
would
soon
have
dissipated
the
one
suspicion
;
and
the
modest
*NL*
calm
of
Nancy
's
speech
and
manners
told
clearly
of
a
mind
free
from
all
*NL*
disavowed
devices
.
*NL*
*NL*
Places
of
honour
had
been
kept
for
the
Miss
Lammeters
near
the
head
of
*NL*
the
principal
tea-table
in
the
wainscoted
parlour
,
now
looking
fresh
*NL*
and
pleasant
with
handsome
branches
of
holly
,
yew
,
and
laurel
,
from
the
*NL*
abundant
growths
of
the
old
garden
;
and
Nancy
felt
an
inward
flutter
,
*NL*
that
no
firmness
of
purpose
could
prevent
,
when
she
saw
Mr.
Godfrey
*NL*
Cass
advancing
to
lead
her
to
a
seat
between
himself
and
Mr.
*NL*
Crackenthorp
,
while
Priscilla
was
called
to
the
opposite
side
between
*NL*
her
father
and
the
Squire
.
It
certainly
did
make
some
difference
to
*NL*
Nancy
that
the
lover
she
had
given
up
was
the
young
man
of
quite
the
*NL*
highest
consequence
in
the
parish
--
at
home
in
a
venerable
and
unique
*NL*
parlour
,
which
was
the
extremity
of
grandeur
in
her
experience
,
a
*NL*
parlour
where
_
she
_
might
one
day
have
been
mistress
,
with
the
*NL*
consciousness
that
she
was
spoken
of
as
``
Madam
Cass
''
,
the
Squire
's
*NL*
wife
.
These
circumstances
exalted
her
inward
drama
in
her
own
eyes
,
*NL*
and
deepened
the
emphasis
with
which
she
declared
to
herself
that
not
*NL*
the
most
dazzling
rank
should
induce
her
to
marry
a
man
whose
conduct
*NL*
showed
him
careless
of
his
character
,
but
that
,
``
love
once
,
love
*NL*
always
''
,
was
the
motto
of
a
true
and
pure
woman
,
and
no
man
should
ever
*NL*
have
any
right
over
her
which
would
be
a
call
on
her
to
destroy
the
*NL*
dried
flowers
that
she
treasured
,
and
always
would
treasure
,
for
*NL*
Godfrey
Cass
's
sake
.
And
Nancy
was
capable
of
keeping
her
word
to
*NL*
herself
under
very
trying
conditions
.
Nothing
but
a
becoming
blush
*NL*
betrayed
the
moving
thoughts
that
urged
themselves
upon
her
as
she
*NL*
accepted
the
seat
next
to
Mr.
Crackenthorp
;
for
she
was
so
*NL*
instinctively
neat
and
adroit
in
all
her
actions
,
and
her
pretty
lips
*NL*
met
each
other
with
such
quiet
firmness
,
that
it
would
have
been
*NL*
difficult
for
her
to
appear
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
the
rector
's
practice
to
let
a
charming
blush
pass
without
*NL*
an
appropriate
compliment
.
He
was
not
in
the
least
lofty
or
*NL*
aristocratic
,
but
simply
a
merry-eyed
,
small-featured
,
grey-haired
man
,
*NL*
with
his
chin
propped
by
an
ample
,
many-creased
white
neckcloth
which
*NL*
seemed
to
predominate
over
every
other
point
in
his
person
,
and
somehow
*NL*
to
impress
its
peculiar
character
on
his
remarks
;
so
that
to
have
*NL*
considered
his
amenities
apart
from
his
cravat
would
have
been
a
*NL*
severe
,
and
perhaps
a
dangerous
,
effort
of
abstraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
Miss
Nancy
,
''
he
said
,
turning
his
head
within
his
cravat
and
*NL*
smiling
down
pleasantly
upon
her
,
``
when
anybody
pretends
this
has
been
*NL*
a
severe
winter
,
I
shall
tell
them
I
saw
the
roses
blooming
on
New
*NL*
Year
's
Eve
--
eh
,
Godfrey
,
what
do
_
you
_
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
made
no
reply
,
and
avoided
looking
at
Nancy
very
markedly
;
for
*NL*
though
these
complimentary
personalities
were
held
to
be
in
excellent
*NL*
taste
in
old-fashioned
Raveloe
society
,
reverent
love
has
a
politeness
*NL*
of
its
own
which
it
teaches
to
men
otherwise
of
small
schooling
.
But
*NL*
the
Squire
was
rather
impatient
at
Godfrey
's
showing
himself
a
dull
*NL*
spark
in
this
way
.
By
this
advanced
hour
of
the
day
,
the
Squire
was
*NL*
always
in
higher
spirits
than
we
have
seen
him
in
at
the
*NL*
breakfast-table
,
and
felt
it
quite
pleasant
to
fulfil
the
hereditary
*NL*
duty
of
being
noisily
jovial
and
patronizing
:
the
large
silver
*NL*
snuff-box
was
in
active
service
and
was
offered
without
fail
to
all
*NL*
neighbours
from
time
to
time
,
however
often
they
might
have
declined
*NL*
the
favour
.
At
present
,
the
Squire
had
only
given
an
express
welcome
*NL*
to
the
heads
of
families
as
they
appeared
;
but
always
as
the
evening
*NL*
deepened
,
his
hospitality
rayed
out
more
widely
,
till
he
had
tapped
the
*NL*
youngest
guests
on
the
back
and
shown
a
peculiar
fondness
for
their
*NL*
presence
,
in
the
full
belief
that
they
must
feel
their
lives
made
happy
*NL*
by
their
belonging
to
a
parish
where
there
was
such
a
hearty
man
as
*NL*
Squire
Cass
to
invite
them
and
wish
them
well
.
Even
in
this
early
*NL*
stage
of
the
jovial
mood
,
it
was
natural
that
he
should
wish
to
supply
*NL*
his
son
's
deficiencies
by
looking
and
speaking
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
he
began
,
offering
his
snuff-box
to
Mr.
Lammeter
,
who
for
*NL*
the
second
time
bowed
his
head
and
waved
his
hand
in
stiff
rejection
of
*NL*
the
offer
,
``
us
old
fellows
may
wish
ourselves
young
to-night
,
when
we
*NL*
see
the
mistletoe-bough
in
the
White
Parlour
.
It
's
true
,
most
things
*NL*
are
gone
back
`
ard
in
these
last
thirty
years
--
the
country
's
going
down
*NL*
since
the
old
king
fell
ill
.
But
when
I
look
at
Miss
Nancy
here
,
I
*NL*
begin
to
think
the
lasses
keep
up
their
quality
;
--
ding
me
if
I
remember
*NL*
a
sample
to
match
her
,
not
when
I
was
a
fine
young
fellow
,
and
thought
*NL*
a
deal
about
my
pigtail
.
No
offence
to
you
,
madam
,
''
he
added
,
bending
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Crackenthorp
,
who
sat
by
him
,
``
I
did
n't
know
_
you
_
when
you
*NL*
were
as
young
as
Miss
Nancy
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Crackenthorp
--
a
small
blinking
woman
,
who
fidgeted
incessantly
*NL*
with
her
lace
,
ribbons
,
and
gold
chain
,
turning
her
head
about
and
*NL*
making
subdued
noises
,
very
much
like
a
guinea-pig
that
twitches
its
*NL*
nose
and
soliloquizes
in
all
company
indiscriminately
--
now
blinked
and
*NL*
fidgeted
towards
the
Squire
,
and
said
,
``
Oh
,
no
--
no
offence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
emphatic
compliment
of
the
Squire
's
to
Nancy
was
felt
by
others
*NL*
besides
Godfrey
to
have
a
diplomatic
significance
;
and
her
father
gave
*NL*
a
slight
additional
erectness
to
his
back
,
as
he
looked
across
the
*NL*
table
at
her
with
complacent
gravity
.
That
grave
and
orderly
senior
*NL*
was
not
going
to
bate
a
jot
of
his
dignity
by
seeming
elated
at
the
*NL*
notion
of
a
match
between
his
family
and
the
Squire
's
:
he
was
gratified
*NL*
by
any
honour
paid
to
his
daughter
;
but
he
must
see
an
alteration
in
*NL*
several
ways
before
his
consent
would
be
vouchsafed
.
His
spare
but
*NL*
healthy
person
,
and
high-featured
firm
face
,
that
looked
as
if
it
had
*NL*
never
been
flushed
by
excess
,
was
in
strong
contrast
,
not
only
with
the
*NL*
Squire
's
,
but
with
the
appearance
of
the
Raveloe
farmers
generally
--
in
*NL*
accordance
with
a
favourite
saying
of
his
own
,
that
``
breed
was
stronger
*NL*
than
pasture
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Nancy
's
wonderful
like
what
her
mother
was
,
though
;
is
n't
she
,
*NL*
Kimble
?
''
said
the
stout
lady
of
that
name
,
looking
round
for
her
*NL*
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Doctor
Kimble
-LRB-
country
apothecaries
in
old
days
enjoyed
that
title
*NL*
without
authority
of
diploma
-RRB-
,
being
a
thin
and
agile
man
,
was
flitting
*NL*
about
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
making
himself
agreeable
*NL*
to
his
feminine
patients
,
with
medical
impartiality
,
and
being
welcomed
*NL*
everywhere
as
a
doctor
by
hereditary
right
--
not
one
of
those
miserable
*NL*
apothecaries
who
canvass
for
practice
in
strange
neighbourhoods
,
and
*NL*
spend
all
their
income
in
starving
their
one
horse
,
but
a
man
of
*NL*
substance
,
able
to
keep
an
extravagant
table
like
the
best
of
his
*NL*
patients
.
Time
out
of
mind
the
Raveloe
doctor
had
been
a
Kimble
;
*NL*
Kimble
was
inherently
a
doctor
's
name
;
and
it
was
difficult
to
*NL*
contemplate
firmly
the
melancholy
fact
that
the
actual
Kimble
had
no
*NL*
son
,
so
that
his
practice
might
one
day
be
handed
over
to
a
successor
*NL*
with
the
incongruous
name
of
Taylor
or
Johnson
.
But
in
that
case
the
*NL*
wiser
people
in
Raveloe
would
employ
Dr.
Blick
of
Flitton
--
as
less
*NL*
unnatural
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
speak
to
me
,
my
dear
?
''
said
the
authentic
doctor
,
coming
*NL*
quickly
to
his
wife
's
side
;
but
,
as
if
foreseeing
that
she
would
be
too
*NL*
much
out
of
breath
to
repeat
her
remark
,
he
went
on
immediately
--
``
Ha
,
*NL*
Miss
Priscilla
,
the
sight
of
you
revives
the
taste
of
that
*NL*
super-excellent
pork-pie
.
I
hope
the
batch
is
n't
near
an
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
it
is
,
doctor
,
''
said
Priscilla
;
``
but
I
'll
answer
for
it
*NL*
the
next
shall
be
as
good
.
My
pork-pies
do
n't
turn
out
well
by
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
as
your
doctoring
does
,
eh
,
Kimble
?
--
because
folks
forget
to
take
*NL*
your
physic
,
eh
?
''
said
the
Squire
,
who
regarded
physic
and
doctors
as
*NL*
many
loyal
churchmen
regard
the
church
and
the
clergy
--
tasting
a
joke
*NL*
against
them
when
he
was
in
health
,
but
impatiently
eager
for
their
aid
*NL*
when
anything
was
the
matter
with
him
.
He
tapped
his
box
,
and
looked
*NL*
round
with
a
triumphant
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
she
has
a
quick
wit
,
my
friend
Priscilla
has
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
*NL*
choosing
to
attribute
the
epigram
to
a
lady
rather
than
allow
a
*NL*
brother-in-law
that
advantage
over
him
.
``
She
saves
a
little
pepper
to
*NL*
sprinkle
over
her
talk
--
that
's
the
reason
why
she
never
puts
too
much
*NL*
into
her
pies
.
There
's
my
wife
now
,
she
never
has
an
answer
at
her
*NL*
tongue
's
end
;
but
if
I
offend
her
,
she
's
sure
to
scarify
my
throat
with
*NL*
black
pepper
the
next
day
,
or
else
give
me
the
colic
with
watery
*NL*
greens
.
That
's
an
awful
tit-for-tat
.
''
Here
the
vivacious
doctor
made
*NL*
a
pathetic
grimace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
hear
the
like
?
''
said
Mrs.
Kimble
,
laughing
above
her
*NL*
double
chin
with
much
good-humour
,
aside
to
Mrs.
Crackenthorp
,
who
*NL*
blinked
and
nodded
,
and
seemed
to
intend
a
smile
,
which
,
by
the
*NL*
correlation
of
forces
,
went
off
in
small
twitchings
and
noises
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
's
the
sort
of
tit-for-tat
adopted
in
your
profession
,
*NL*
Kimble
,
if
you
've
a
grudge
against
a
patient

''
said
the
rector
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
do
have
a
grudge
against
our
patients
,
''
said
Mr.
Kimble
,
``
except
*NL*
when
they
leave
us
:
and
then

you
see
,
we
have
n't
the
chance

prescribing
for
'em
.
Ha
,
Miss
Nancy

''
he
continued
,
suddenly
skipping
*NL*
to
Nancy
's
side
,
``
you
wo
n't

the

throwing
himself
backward

looking
at

*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
,
sorely
uncomfortable
under
this
significant
insistence
about
*NL*
Nancy
,
and
afraid
to
think
where
it
would
end
by
the
time
his
father
*NL*
had
set
his
usual
hospitable
example
of
drinking
before
and
after
*NL*
supper
,
saw
no
course
open
but
to
turn
to
Nancy
and
say
,
with
as
little
*NL*
awkwardness
as
possible
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
've
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I

not
engaged

said
Nancy
,
quietly
,
though
blushingly
.
*NL*
-LRB-
If
Mr.
Godfrey
founded
any
hopes
on
her
consenting
to
dance
with
him
,
*NL*
he
would
soon
be
undeceived
;
but
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
be

uncivil

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
hope

no

said
Godfrey
,
*NL*
beginning
to
lose
the
sense
that
there
was
anything
uncomfortable
in
*NL*
this
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

said
Nancy
,
in
a
cold
tone

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

well

you
're
a
lucky
fellow

Godfrey

said
uncle
Kimble
;

he
went
on
,
skipping
to
his
wife

side
again
.
*NL*
``
You
would

my
having
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
take
a
cup
o

tea
and
stop
your
tongue

''
said
*NL*
good-humoured
Mrs.
Kimble
,
feeling
some
pride
in
a
husband
who
must
be
*NL*
regarded
as
so
clever
and
amusing
by
the
company
generally
.
If
he
had
*NL*
only
not
been
irritable
at
cards
!
*NL*
*NL*
While
safe
,
well-tested
personalities
were
enlivening
the
tea
in
this
*NL*
way
,
the
sound
of
the
fiddle
approaching
within
a
distance
at
which
it
*NL*
could
be
heard
distinctly
,
made
the
young
people
look
at
each
other
*NL*
with
sympathetic
impatience
for
the
end
of
the
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
's
Solomon
in
the
hall
,
''
said
the
Squire
,
``
and
playing
my
*NL*
fav
`
rite
tune
,
_
I
_
believe
--
``
The
flaxen-headed
ploughboy
''
--
he
's
for
*NL*
giving
us
a
hint
as
we
are
n't
enough
in
a
hurry
to
hear
him
play
.
*NL*
Bob
,
''
he
called
out
to
his
third
long-legged
son
,
who
was
at
the
other
*NL*
end
of
the
room
,
``
open
the
door
,
and
tell
Solomon
to
come
in
.
He
shall
*NL*
give
us
a
tune
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bob
obeyed
,
and
Solomon
walked
in
,
fiddling
as
he
walked
,
for
he
would
*NL*
on
no
account
break
off
in
the
middle
of
a
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Solomon
,
''
said
the
Squire
,
with
loud
patronage
.
``
Round
here
,
my
*NL*
man
.
Ah
,
I
knew
it
was
``
The
flaxen-headed
ploughboy
''
:
there
's
no
finer
*NL*
tune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Solomon
Macey
,
a
small
hale
old
man
with
an
abundant
crop
of
long
white
*NL*
hair
reaching
nearly
to
his
shoulders
,
advanced
to
the
indicated
spot
,
*NL*
bowing
reverently
while
he
fiddled
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
respected
*NL*
the
company
,
though
he
respected
the
key-note
more
.
As
soon
as
he
had
*NL*
repeated
the
tune
and
lowered
his
fiddle
,
he
bowed
again
to
the
Squire
*NL*
and
the
rector
,
and
said
,
``
I
hope
I
see
your
honour
and
your
reverence
*NL*
well
,
and
wishing
you
health
and
long
life
and
a
happy
New
Year
.
And
*NL*
wishing
the
same
to
you
,
Mr.
Lammeter
,
sir
;
and
to
the
other
gentlemen
,
*NL*
and
the
madams
,
and
the
young
lasses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Solomon
uttered
the
last
words
,
he
bowed
in
all
directions
*NL*
solicitously
,
lest
he
should
be
wanting
in
due
respect
.
But
thereupon
*NL*
he
immediately
began
to
prelude
,
and
fell
into
the
tune
which
he
knew
*NL*
would
be
taken
as
a
special
compliment
by
Mr.
Lammeter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
ye
,
Solomon
,
thank
ye
,
''
said
Mr.
Lammeter
when
the
fiddle
paused
*NL*
again
.
``
That
's
``
Over
the
hills
and
far
away
''
,
that
is
.
My
father
used
*NL*
to
say
to
me
,
whenever
we
heard
that
tune
,
``
Ah
,
lad
,
_
I
_
come
from
over
*NL*
the
hills
and
far
away
.
''
There
's
a
many
tunes
I
do
n't
make
head
or
*NL*
tail
of
;
but
that
speaks
to
me
like
the
blackbird
's
whistle
.
I
suppose
*NL*
it
's
the
name
:
there
's
a
deal
in
the
name
of
a
tune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Solomon
was
already
impatient
to
prelude
again
,
and
presently
broke
*NL*
with
much
spirit
into
``
Sir
Roger
de
Coverley
''
,
at
which
there
was
a
*NL*
sound
of
chairs
pushed
back
,
and
laughing
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
Solomon
,
we
know
what
that
means
,
''
said
the
Squire
,
rising
.
*NL*
``
It
's
time
to
begin
the
dance
,
eh
?
Lead
the
way
,
then
,
and
we
'll
all
*NL*
follow
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Solomon
,
holding
his
white
head
on
one
side
,
and
playing
vigorously
,
*NL*
marched
forward
at
the
head
of
the
gay
procession
into
the
White
*NL*
Parlour
,
where
the
mistletoe-bough
was
hung
,
and
multitudinous
tallow
*NL*
candles
made
rather
a
brilliant
effect
,
gleaming
from
among
the
berried
*NL*
holly-boughs
,
and
reflected
in
the
old-fashioned
oval
mirrors
fastened
*NL*
in
the
panels
of
the
white
wainscot
.
A
quaint
procession
!
Old
*NL*
Solomon
,
in
his
seedy
clothes
and
long
white
locks
,
seemed
to
be
luring
*NL*
that
decent
company
by
the
magic
scream
of
his
fiddle
--
luring
discreet
*NL*
matrons
in
turban-shaped
caps
,
nay
,
Mrs.
Crackenthorp
herself
,
the
*NL*
summit
of
whose
perpendicular
feather
was
on
a
level
with
the
Squire
's
*NL*
shoulder
--
luring
fair
lasses
complacently
conscious
of
very
short
*NL*
waists
and
skirts
blameless
of
front-folds
--
luring
burly
fathers
in
*NL*
large
variegated
waistcoats
,
and
ruddy
sons
,
for
the
most
part
shy
and
*NL*
sheepish
,
in
short
nether
garments
and
very
long
coat-tails
.
*NL*
*NL*
Already
Mr.
Macey
and
a
few
other
privileged
villagers
,
who
were
*NL*
allowed
to
be
spectators
on
these
great
occasions
,
were
seated
on
*NL*
benches
placed
for
them
near
the
door
;
and
great
was
the
admiration
and
*NL*
satisfaction
in
that
quarter
when
the
couples
had
formed
themselves
for
*NL*
the
dance
,
and
the
Squire
led
off
with
Mrs.
Crackenthorp
,
joining
hands
*NL*
with
the
rector
and
Mrs.
Osgood
.
That
was
as
it
should
be
--
that
was
*NL*
what
everybody
had
been
used
to
--
and
the
charter
of
Raveloe
seemed
to
*NL*
be
renewed
by
the
ceremony
.
It
was
not
thought
of
as
an
unbecoming
*NL*
levity
for
the
old
and
middle-aged
people
to
dance
a
little
before
*NL*
sitting
down
to
cards
,
but
rather
as
part
of
their
social
duties
.
For
*NL*
what
were
these
if
not
to
be
merry
at
appropriate
times
,
interchanging
*NL*
visits
and
poultry
with
due
frequency
,
paying
each
other
*NL*
old-established
compliments
in
sound
traditional
phrases
,
passing
*NL*
well-tried
personal
jokes
,
urging
your
guests
to
eat
and
drink
too
much
*NL*
out
of
hospitality
,
and
eating
and
drinking
too
much
in
your
*NL*
neighbour
's
house
to
show
that
you
liked
your
cheer
?
And
the
parson
*NL*
naturally
set
an
example
in
these
social
duties
.
For
it
would
not
have
*NL*
been
possible
for
the
Raveloe
mind
,
without
a
peculiar
revelation
,
to
*NL*
know
that
a
clergyman
should
be
a
pale-faced
memento
of
solemnities
,
*NL*
instead
of
a
reasonably
faulty
man
whose
exclusive
authority
to
read
*NL*
prayers
and
preach
,
to
christen
,
marry
,
and
bury
you
,
necessarily
*NL*
coexisted
with
the
right
to
sell
you
the
ground
to
be
buried
in
and
to
*NL*
take
tithe
in
kind
;
on
which
last
point
,
of
course
,
there
was
a
little
*NL*
grumbling
,
but
not
to
the
extent
of
irreligion
--
not
of
deeper
*NL*
significance
than
the
grumbling
at
the
rain
,
which
was
by
no
means
*NL*
accompanied
with
a
spirit
of
impious
defiance
,
but
with
a
desire
that
*NL*
the
prayer
for
fine
weather
might
be
read
forthwith
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reason
,
then
,
why
the
rector
's
dancing
should
not
be
*NL*
received
as
part
of
the
fitness
of
things
quite
as
much
as
the
*NL*
Squire
's
,
or
why
,
on
the
other
hand
,
Mr.
Macey
's
official
respect
*NL*
should
restrain
him
from
subjecting
the
parson
's
performance
to
that
*NL*
criticism
with
which
minds
of
extraordinary
acuteness
must
necessarily
*NL*
contemplate
the
doings
of
their
fallible
fellow-men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Squire
's
pretty
springe
,
considering
his
weight
,
''
said
Mr.
Macey
,
*NL*
``
and
he
stamps
uncommon
well
.
But
Mr.
Lammeter
beats
'em
all
for
*NL*
shapes

you
see
he
holds
his
head
like
a
sodger
,
and
he
is
n't
so
*NL*
cushiony
as
most
o

the
oldish
gentlefolks
--
they
run
fat
in
general
;
*NL*
and
he
's
got
a
fine
leg

The
parson
's
nimble
enough
,
but
he
has
n't
got
*NL*
much
of
a
leg
:
it
's
a
bit
too
thick
down

his
knees
might
be
a
*NL*
bit
nearer

damage

do
worse

*NL*
*NL*
``

Ben
Winthrop

Mr.

screwed
up

leaned
his

further

twirled
his

followed

up

summed
up

he
be
turned
*NL*
round
the
finger
by
that
offal
Dunsey
as
nobody
's
seen
o
'
late
,
and
let
*NL*
him
kill
that
fine
hunting
hoss
as
was
the
talk
o
'
the
country
?
And
*NL*
one
while
he
was
allays
after
Miss
Nancy
,
and
then
it
all
went
off
*NL*
again
,
like
a
smell
o
'
hot
porridge
,
as
I
may
say
.
That
was
n't
my
way
*NL*
when
_
I
_
went
a-coorting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
mayhap
Miss
Nancy
hung
off
,
like
,
and
your
lass
did
n't
,
''
said
*NL*
Ben
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
she
did
n't
,
''
said
Mr.
Macey
,
significantly
.
``
Before
I
*NL*
said
``
sniff
''
,
I
took
care
to
know
as
she
'd
say
``
snaff
''
,
and
pretty
*NL*
quick
too
.
I
was
n't
a-going
to
open
_
my
_
mouth
,
like
a
dog
at
a
fly
,
*NL*
and
snap
it
to
again
,
wi
'
nothing
to
swaller
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
think
Miss
Nancy
's
a-coming
round
again
,
''
said
Ben
,
``
for
*NL*
Master
Godfrey
does
n't
look
so
down-hearted
to-night
.
And
I
see
he
's
*NL*
for
taking
her
away
to
sit
down
,
now
they
're
at
the
end
o
'
the
dance
:
*NL*
that
looks
like
sweethearting
,
that
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reason
why
Godfrey
and
Nancy
had
left
the
dance
was
not
so
tender
*NL*
as
Ben
imagined
.
In
the
close
press
of
couples
a
slight
accident
had
*NL*
happened
to
Nancy
's
dress
,
which
,
while
it
was
short
enough
to
show
her
*NL*
neat
ankle
in
front
,
was
long
enough
behind
to
be
caught
under
the
*NL*
stately
stamp
of
the
Squire
's
foot
,
so
as
to
rend
certain
stitches
at
*NL*
the
waist
,
and
cause
much
sisterly
agitation
in
Priscilla
's
mind
,
as
*NL*
well
as
serious
concern
in
Nancy
's
.
One
's
thoughts
may
be
much
*NL*
occupied
with
love-struggles
,
but
hardly
so
as
to
be
insensible
to
a
*NL*
disorder
in
the
general
framework
of
things
.
Nancy
had
no
sooner
*NL*
completed
her
duty
in
the
figure
they
were
dancing
than
she
said
to
*NL*
Godfrey
,
with
a
deep
blush
,
that
she
must
go
and
sit
down
till
*NL*
Priscilla
could
come
to
her
;
for
the
sisters
had
already
exchanged
a
*NL*
short
whisper
and
an
open-eyed
glance
full
of
meaning
.
No
reason
less
*NL*
urgent
than
this
could
have
prevailed
on
Nancy
to
give
Godfrey
this
*NL*
opportunity
of
sitting
apart
with
her
.
As
for
Godfrey
,
he
was
feeling
*NL*
so
happy
and
oblivious
under
the
long
charm
of
the
country-dance
with
*NL*
Nancy
,
that
he
got
rather
bold
on
the
strength
of
her
confusion
,
and
*NL*
was
capable
of
leading
her
straight
away
,
without
leave
asked
,
into
the
*NL*
adjoining
small
parlour
,
where
the
card-tables
were
set
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Nancy
,
coldly
,
as
soon
as
she
perceived
where
*NL*
he
was
going
,
``
not
in
there
.
I
'll
wait
here
till
Priscilla
's
ready
to
*NL*
come
to
me
.
I
'm
sorry
to
bring
you
out
of
the
dance
and
make
myself
*NL*
troublesome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
'll
be
more
comfortable
here
by
yourself
,
''
said
the
artful
*NL*
Godfrey
:
``
I
'll
leave
you
here
till
your
sister
can
come
.
''
He
spoke
in
*NL*
an
indifferent
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
an
agreeable
proposition
,
and
just
what
Nancy
desired
;
why
,
*NL*
then
,
was
she
a
little
hurt
that
Mr.
Godfrey
should
make
it
?
They
*NL*
entered
,
and
she
seated
herself
on
a
chair
against
one
of
the
*NL*
card-tables
,
as
the
stiffest
and
most
unapproachable
position
she
could
*NL*
choose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
she
said
immediately
.
``
I
need
n't
give
you
any
more
*NL*
trouble
.
I
'm
sorry
you
've
had
such
an
unlucky
partner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
ill-natured
of
you
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
standing
by
her
without
*NL*
any
sign
of
intended
departure
,
``
to
be
sorry
you
've
danced
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
what
's
ill-natured
at
all
,
''
said
*NL*
Nancy
,
looking
distractingly
prim
and
pretty
.
``
When
gentlemen
have
so
*NL*
many
pleasures
,
one
dance
can
matter
but
very
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
is
n't
true
.
You
know
one
dance
with
you
matters
more
to
*NL*
me
than
all
the
other
pleasures
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
,
long
while
since
Godfrey
had
said
anything
so
direct
as
*NL*
that
,
and
Nancy
was
startled
.
But
her
instinctive
dignity
and
*NL*
repugnance
to
any
show
of
emotion
made
her
sit
perfectly
still
,
and
*NL*
only
throw
a
little
more
decision
into
her
voice
,
as
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Godfrey
,
that
's
not
known
to
me
,
and
I
have
very
good
*NL*
reasons
for
thinking
different
.
But
if
it
's
true
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
hear
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
never
forgive
me
,
then
,
Nancy
--
never
think
well
of
me
,
let
*NL*
what
would
happen
--
would
you
never
think
the
present
made
amends
for
*NL*
the
past
?
Not
if
I
turned
a
good
fellow
,
and
gave
up
everything
you
*NL*
did
n't
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
was
half
conscious
that
this
sudden
opportunity
of
speaking
to
*NL*
Nancy
alone
had
driven
him
beside
himself
;
but
blind
feeling
had
got
*NL*
the
mastery
of
his
tongue
.
Nancy
really
felt
much
agitated
by
the
*NL*
possibility
Godfrey
's
words
suggested
,
but
this
very
pressure
of
*NL*
emotion
that
she
was
in
danger
of
finding
too
strong
for
her
roused
all
*NL*
her
power
of
self-command
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
glad
to
see
a
good
change
in
anybody
,
Mr.
Godfrey
,
''
she
*NL*
answered
,
with
the
slightest
discernible
difference
of
tone
,
``
but
it
*NL*
`
ud
be
better
if
no
change
was
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
hard-hearted
,
Nancy
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
pettishly
.
``
You
might
*NL*
encourage
me
to
be
a
better
fellow
.
I
'm
very
miserable
--
but
you
've
no
*NL*
feeling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
those
have
the
least
feeling
that
act
wrong
to
begin
with
,
''
*NL*
said
Nancy
,
sending
out
a
flash
in
spite
of
herself
.
Godfrey
was
*NL*
delighted
with
that
little
flash
,
and
would
have
liked
to
go
on
and
*NL*
make
her
quarrel
with
him
;
Nancy
was
so
exasperatingly
quiet
and
firm
.
*NL*
But
she
was
not
indifferent
to
him
_
yet
_
,
though
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance
of
Priscilla
,
bustling
forward
and
saying
,
``
Dear
heart
*NL*
alive
,
child
,
let
us
look
at
this
gown
,
''
cut
off
Godfrey
's
hopes
of
a
*NL*
quarrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
must
go
now
,
''
he
said
to
Priscilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
matter
to
me
whether
you
go
or
stay
,
''
said
that
frank
lady
,
*NL*
searching
for
something
in
her
pocket
,
with
a
preoccupied
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
_
you
_
want
me
to
go
?
''
said
Godfrey
,
looking
at
Nancy
,
who
was
now
*NL*
standing
up
by
Priscilla
's
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like
,
''
said
Nancy
,
trying
to
recover
all
her
former
coldness
,
*NL*
and
looking
down
carefully
at
the
hem
of
her
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
like
to
stay
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
with
a
reckless
determination
to
*NL*
get
as
much
of
this
joy
as
he
could
to-night
,
and
think
nothing
of
the
*NL*
morrow
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
While
Godfrey
Cass
was
taking
draughts
of
forgetfulness
from
the
sweet
*NL*
presence
of
Nancy
,
willingly
losing
all
sense
of
that
hidden
bond
which
*NL*
at
other
moments
galled
and
fretted
him
so
as
to
mingle
irritation
with
*NL*
the
very
sunshine
,
Godfrey
's
wife
was
walking
with
slow
uncertain
steps
*NL*
through
the
snow-covered
Raveloe
lanes
,
carrying
her
child
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
journey
on
New
Year
's
Eve
was
a
premeditated
act
of
vengeance
*NL*
which
she
had
kept
in
her
heart
ever
since
Godfrey
,
in
a
fit
of
*NL*
passion
,
had
told
her
he
would
sooner
die
than
acknowledge
her
as
his
*NL*
wife
.
There
would
be
a
great
party
at
the
Red
House
on
New
Year
's
Eve
,
*NL*
she
knew
:
her
husband
would
be
smiling
and
smiled
upon
,
hiding
_
her
_
*NL*
existence
in
the
darkest
corner
of
his
heart
.
But
she
would
mar
his
*NL*
pleasure
:
she
would
go
in
her
dingy
rags
,
with
her
faded
face
,
once
as
*NL*
handsome
as
the
best
,
with
her
little
child
that
had
its
father
's
hair
*NL*
and
eyes
,
and
disclose
herself
to
the
Squire
as
his
eldest
son
's
wife
.
*NL*
It
is
seldom
that
the
miserable
can
help
regarding
their
misery
as
a
*NL*
wrong
inflicted
by
those
who
are
less
miserable
.
Molly
knew
that
the
*NL*
cause
of
her
dingy
rags
was
not
her
husband
's
neglect
,
but
the
demon
*NL*
Opium
to
whom
she
was
enslaved
,
body
and
soul
,
except
in
the
lingering
*NL*
mother
's
tenderness
that
refused
to
give
him
her
hungry
child
.
She
*NL*
knew
this
well
;
and
yet
,
in
the
moments
of
wretched
unbenumbed
*NL*
consciousness
,
the
sense
of
her
want
and
degradation
transformed
itself
*NL*
continually
into
bitterness
towards
Godfrey
.
_
He
_
was
well
off
;
and
if
*NL*
she
had
her
rights
she
would
be
well
off
too
.
The
belief
that
he
*NL*
repented
his
marriage
,
and
suffered
from
it
,
only
aggravated
her
*NL*
vindictiveness
.
Just
and
self-reproving
thoughts
do
not
come
to
us
too
*NL*
thickly
,
even
in
the
purest
air
,
and
with
the
best
lessons
of
heaven
*NL*
and
earth
;
how
should
those
white-winged
delicate
messengers
make
their
*NL*
way
to
Molly
's
poisoned
chamber
,
inhabited
by
no
higher
memories
than
*NL*
those
of
a
barmaid
's
paradise
of
pink
ribbons
and
gentlemen
's
jokes
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
set
out
at
an
early
hour
,
but
had
lingered
on
the
road
,
*NL*
inclined
by
her
indolence
to
believe
that
if
she
waited
under
a
warm
*NL*
shed
the
snow
would
cease
to
fall
.
She
had
waited
longer
than
she
*NL*
knew
,
and
now
that
she
found
herself
belated
in
the
snow-hidden
*NL*
ruggedness
of
the
long
lanes
,
even
the
animation
of
a
vindictive
*NL*
purpose
could
not
keep
her
spirit
from
failing
.
It
was
seven
o'clock
,
*NL*
and
by
this
time
she
was
not
very
far
from
Raveloe
,
but
she
was
not
*NL*
familiar
enough
with
those
monotonous
lanes
to
know
how
near
she
was
to
*NL*
her
journey
's
end
.
She
needed
comfort
,
and
she
knew
but
one
*NL*
comforter
--
the
familiar
demon
in
her
bosom
;
but
she
hesitated
a
moment
,
*NL*
after
drawing
out
the
black
remnant
,
before
she
raised
it
to
her
lips
.
*NL*
In
that
moment
the
mother
's
love
pleaded
for
painful
consciousness
*NL*
rather
than
oblivion
--
pleaded
to
be
left
in
aching
weariness
,
rather
*NL*
than
to
have
the
encircling
arms
benumbed
so
that
they
could
not
feel
*NL*
the
dear
burden
.
In
another
moment
Molly
had
flung
something
away
,
but
*NL*
it
was
not
the
black
remnant
--
it
was
an
empty
phial
.
And
she
walked
on
*NL*
again
under
the
breaking
cloud
,
from
which
there
came
now
and
then
the
*NL*
light
of
a
quickly
veiled
star
,
for
a
freezing
wind
had
sprung
up
since
*NL*
the
snowing
had
ceased
.
But
she
walked
always
more
and
more
drowsily
,
*NL*
and
clutched
more
and
more
automatically
the
sleeping
child
at
her
*NL*
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
the
demon
was
working
his
will
,
and
cold
and
weariness
were
his
*NL*
helpers
.
Soon
she
felt
nothing
but
a
supreme
immediate
longing
that
*NL*
curtained
off
all
futurity
--
the
longing
to
lie
down
and
sleep
.
She
had
*NL*
arrived
at
a
spot
where
her
footsteps
were
no
longer
checked
by
a
*NL*
hedgerow
,
and
she
had
wandered
vaguely
,
unable
to
distinguish
any
*NL*
objects
,
notwithstanding
the
wide
whiteness
around
her
,
and
the
growing
*NL*
starlight
.
She
sank
down
against
a
straggling
furze
bush
,
an
easy
*NL*
pillow
enough
;
and
the
bed
of
snow
,
too
,
was
soft
.
She
did
not
feel
*NL*
that
the
bed
was
cold
,
and
did
not
heed
whether
the
child
would
wake
*NL*
and
cry
for
her
.
But
her
arms
had
not
yet
relaxed
their
instinctive
*NL*
clutch
;
and
the
little
one
slumbered
on
as
gently
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
rocked
in
a
lace-trimmed
cradle
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
complete
torpor
came
at
last
:
the
fingers
lost
their
tension
,
*NL*
the
arms
unbent
;
then
the
little
head
fell
away
from
the
bosom
,
and
the
*NL*
blue
eyes
opened
wide
on
the
cold
starlight
.
At
first
there
was
a
*NL*
little
peevish
cry
of
``
mammy
''
,
and
an
effort
to
regain
the
pillowing
*NL*
arm
and
bosom
;
but
mammy
's
ear
was
deaf
,
and
the
pillow
seemed
to
be
*NL*
slipping
away
backward
.
Suddenly
,
as
the
child
rolled
downward
on
its
*NL*
mother
's
knees
,
all
wet
with
snow
,
its
eyes
were
caught
by
a
bright
*NL*
glancing
light
on
the
white
ground
,
and
,
with
the
ready
transition
of
*NL*
infancy
,
it
was
immediately
absorbed
in
watching
the
bright
living
*NL*
thing
running
towards
it
,
yet
never
arriving
.
That
bright
living
thing
*NL*
must
be
caught
;
and
in
an
instant
the
child
had
slipped
on
all-fours
,
*NL*
and
held
out
one
little
hand
to
catch
the
gleam
.
But
the
gleam
would
*NL*
not
be
caught
in
that
way
,
and
now
the
head
was
held
up
to
see
where
*NL*
the
cunning
gleam
came
from
.
It
came
from
a
very
bright
place
;
and
the
*NL*
little
one
,
rising
on
its
legs
,
toddled
through
the
snow
,
the
old
grimy
*NL*
shawl
in
which
it
was
wrapped
trailing
behind
it
,
and
the
queer
little
*NL*
bonnet
dangling
at
its
back
--
toddled
on
to
the
open
door
of
Silas
*NL*
Marner
's
cottage
,
and
right
up
to
the
warm
hearth
,
where
there
was
a
*NL*
bright
fire
of
logs
and
sticks
,
which
had
thoroughly
warmed
the
old
*NL*
sack
-LRB-
Silas
's
greatcoat
-RRB-
spread
out
on
the
bricks
to
dry
.
The
little
*NL*
one
,
accustomed
to
be
left
to
itself
for
long
hours
without
notice
from
*NL*
its
mother
,
squatted
down
on
the
sack
,
and
spread
its
tiny
hands
*NL*
towards
the
blaze
,
in
perfect
contentment
,
gurgling
and
making
many
*NL*
inarticulate
communications
to
the
cheerful
fire
,
like
a
new-hatched
*NL*
gosling
beginning
to
find
itself
comfortable
.
But
presently
the
warmth
*NL*
had
a
lulling
effect
,
and
the
little
golden
head
sank
down
on
the
old
*NL*
sack
,
and
the
blue
eyes
were
veiled
by
their
delicate
half-transparent
*NL*
lids
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
where
was
Silas
Marner
while
this
strange
visitor
had
come
to
his
*NL*
hearth
?
He
was
in
the
cottage
,
but
he
did
not
see
the
child
.
During
*NL*
the
last
few
weeks
,
since
he
had
lost
his
money
,
he
had
contracted
the
*NL*
habit
of
opening
his
door
and
looking
out
from
time
to
time
,
as
if
he
*NL*
thought
that
his
money
might
be
somehow
coming
back
to
him
,
or
that
*NL*
some
trace
,
some
news
of
it
,
might
be
mysteriously
on
the
road
,
and
be
*NL*
caught
by
the
listening
ear
or
the
straining
eye
.
It
was
chiefly
at
*NL*
night
,
when
he
was
not
occupied
in
his
loom
,
that
he
fell
into
this
*NL*
repetition
of
an
act
for
which
he
could
have
assigned
no
definite
*NL*
purpose
,
and
which
can
hardly
be
understood
except
by
those
who
have
*NL*
undergone
a
bewildering
separation
from
a
supremely
loved
object
.
In
*NL*
the
evening
twilight
,
and
later
whenever
the
night
was
not
dark
,
Silas
*NL*
looked
out
on
that
narrow
prospect
round
the
Stone-pits
,
listening
and
*NL*
gazing
,
not
with
hope
,
but
with
mere
yearning
and
unrest
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
morning
he
had
been
told
by
some
of
his
neighbours
that
it
was
New
*NL*
Year
's
Eve
,
and
that
he
must
sit
up
and
hear
the
old
year
rung
out
and
*NL*
the
new
rung
in
,
because
that
was
good
luck
,
and
might
bring
his
money
*NL*
back
again
.
This
was
only
a
friendly
Raveloe-way
of
jesting
with
the
*NL*
half-crazy
oddities
of
a
miser
,
but
it
had
perhaps
helped
to
throw
*NL*
Silas
into
a
more
than
usually
excited
state
.
Since
the
on-coming
of
*NL*
twilight
he
had
opened
his
door
again
and
again
,
though
only
to
shut
it
*NL*
immediately
at
seeing
all
distance
veiled
by
the
falling
snow
.
But
the
*NL*
last
time
he
opened
it
the
snow
had
ceased
,
and
the
clouds
were
parting
*NL*
here
and
there
.
He
stood
and
listened
,
and
gazed
for
a
long
*NL*
while
--
there
was
really
something
on
the
road
coming
towards
him
then
,
*NL*
but
he
caught
no
sign
of
it
;
and
the
stillness
and
the
wide
trackless
*NL*
snow
seemed
to
narrow
his
solitude
,
and
touched
his
yearning
with
the
*NL*
chill
of
despair
.
He
went
in
again
,
and
put
his
right
hand
on
the
*NL*
latch
of
the
door
to
close
it
--
but
he
did
not
close
it
:
he
was
*NL*
arrested
,
as
he
had
been
already
since
his
loss
,
by
the
invisible
wand
*NL*
of
catalepsy
,
and
stood
like
a
graven
image
,
with
wide
but
sightless
*NL*
eyes
,
holding
open
his
door
,
powerless
to
resist
either
the
good
or
the
*NL*
evil
that
might
enter
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marner
's
sensibility
returned
,
he
continued
the
action
which
had
*NL*
been
arrested
,
and
closed
his
door
,
unaware
of
the
chasm
in
his
*NL*
consciousness
,
unaware
of
any
intermediate
change
,
except
that
the
*NL*
light
had
grown
dim
,
and
that
he
was
chilled
and
faint
.
He
thought
he
*NL*
had
been
too
long
standing
at
the
door
and
looking
out
.
Turning
*NL*
towards
the
hearth
,
where
the
two
logs
had
fallen
apart
,
and
sent
forth
*NL*
only
a
red
uncertain
glimmer
,
he
seated
himself
on
his
fireside
chair
,
*NL*
and
was
stooping
to
push
his
logs
together
,
when
,
to
his
blurred
*NL*
vision
,
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
gold
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
*NL*
hearth
.
Gold
!
--
his
own
gold
--
brought
back
to
him
as
mysteriously
as
it
*NL*
had
been
taken
away
!
He
felt
his
heart
begin
to
beat
violently
,
and
*NL*
for
a
few
moments
he
was
unable
to
stretch
out
his
hand
and
grasp
the
*NL*
restored
treasure
.
The
heap
of
gold
seemed
to
glow
and
get
larger
*NL*
beneath
his
agitated
gaze
.
He
leaned
forward
at
last
,
and
stretched
*NL*
forth
his
hand
;
but
instead
of
the
hard
coin
with
the
familiar
*NL*
resisting
outline
,
his
fingers
encountered
soft
warm
curls
.
In
utter
*NL*
amazement
,
Silas
fell
on
his
knees
and
bent
his
head
low
to
examine
the
*NL*
marvel
:
it
was
a
sleeping
child
--
a
round
,
fair
thing
,
with
soft
yellow
*NL*
rings
all
over
its
head
.
Could
this
be
his
little
sister
come
back
to
*NL*
him
in
a
dream
--
his
little
sister
whom
he
had
carried
about
in
his
arms
*NL*
for
a
year
before
she
died
,
when
he
was
a
small
boy
without
shoes
or
*NL*
stockings
?
That
was
the
first
thought
that
darted
across
Silas
's
blank
*NL*
wonderment
.
_
Was
_
it
a
dream
?
He
rose
to
his
feet
again
,
pushed
his
*NL*
logs
together
,
and
,
throwing
on
some
dried
leaves
and
sticks
,
raised
a
*NL*
flame
;
but
the
flame
did
not
disperse
the
vision
--
it
only
lit
up
more
*NL*
distinctly
the
little
round
form
of
the
child
,
and
its
shabby
clothing
.
*NL*
It
was
very
much
like
his
little
sister
.
Silas
sank
into
his
chair
*NL*
powerless
,
under
the
double
presence
of
an
inexplicable
surprise
and
a
*NL*
hurrying
influx
of
memories
.
How
and
when
had
the
child
come
in
*NL*
without
his
knowledge
?
He
had
never
been
beyond
the
door
.
But
along
*NL*
with
that
question
,
and
almost
thrusting
it
away
,
there
was
a
vision
of
*NL*
the
old
home
and
the
old
streets
leading
to
Lantern
Yard
--
and
within
*NL*
that
vision
another
,
of
the
thoughts
which
had
been
present
with
him
in
*NL*
those
far-off
scenes
.
The
thoughts
were
strange
to
him
now
,
like
old
*NL*
friendships
impossible
to
revive
;
and
yet
he
had
a
dreamy
feeling
that
*NL*
this
child
was
somehow
a
message
come
to
him
from
that
far-off
life
:
it
*NL*
stirred
fibres
that
had
never
been
moved
in
Raveloe
--
old
quiverings
of
*NL*
tenderness
--
old
impressions
of
awe
at
the
presentiment
of
some
Power
*NL*
presiding
over
his
life
;
for
his
imagination
had
not
yet
extricated
*NL*
itself
from
the
sense
of
mystery
in
the
child
's
sudden
presence
,
and
*NL*
had
formed
no
conjectures
of
ordinary
natural
means
by
which
the
event
*NL*
could
have
been
brought
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
a
cry
on
the
hearth
:
the
child
had
awaked
,
and
Marner
*NL*
stooped
to
lift
it
on
his
knee
.
It
clung
round
his
neck
,
and
burst
*NL*
louder
and
louder
into
that
mingling
of
inarticulate
cries
with
``
mammy
''
*NL*
by
which
little
children
express
the
bewilderment
of
waking
.
Silas
*NL*
pressed
it
to
him
,
and
almost
unconsciously
uttered
sounds
of
hushing
*NL*
tenderness
,
while
he
bethought
himself
that
some
of
his
porridge
,
which
*NL*
had
got
cool
by
the
dying
fire
,
would
do
to
feed
the
child
with
if
it
*NL*
were
only
warmed
up
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
plenty
to
do
through
the
next
hour
.
The
porridge
,
sweetened
*NL*
with
some
dry
brown
sugar
from
an
old
store
which
he
had
refrained
from
*NL*
using
for
himself
,
stopped
the
cries
of
the
little
one
,
and
made
her
*NL*
lift
her
blue
eyes
with
a
wide
quiet
gaze
at
Silas
,
as
he
put
the
spoon
*NL*
into
her
mouth
.
Presently
she
slipped
from
his
knee
and
began
to
*NL*
toddle
about
,
but
with
a
pretty
stagger
that
made
Silas
jump
up
and
*NL*
follow
her
lest
she
should
fall
against
anything
that
would
hurt
her
.
*NL*
But
she
only
fell
in
a
sitting
posture
on
the
ground
,
and
began
to
pull
*NL*
at
her
boots
,
looking
up
at
him
with
a
crying
face
as
if
the
boots
hurt
*NL*
her
.
He
took
her
on
his
knee
again
,
but
it
was
some
time
before
it
*NL*
occurred
to
Silas
's
dull
bachelor
mind
that
the
wet
boots
were
the
*NL*
grievance
,
pressing
on
her
warm
ankles
.
He
got
them
off
with
*NL*
difficulty
,
and
baby
was
at
once
happily
occupied
with
the
primary
*NL*
mystery
of
her
own
toes
,
inviting
Silas
,
with
much
chuckling
,
to
*NL*
consider
the
mystery
too
.
But
the
wet
boots
had
at
last
suggested
to
*NL*
Silas
that
the
child
had
been
walking
on
the
snow
,
and
this
roused
him
*NL*
from
his
entire
oblivion
of
any
ordinary
means
by
which
it
could
have
*NL*
entered
or
been
brought
into
his
house
.
Under
the
prompting
of
this
*NL*
new
idea
,
and
without
waiting
to
form
conjectures
,
he
raised
the
child
*NL*
in
his
arms
,
and
went
to
the
door
.
As
soon
as
he
had
opened
it
,
there
*NL*
was
the
cry
of
``
mammy
''
again
,
which
Silas
had
not
heard
since
the
*NL*
child
's
first
hungry
waking
.
Bending
forward
,
he
could
just
discern
*NL*
the
marks
made
by
the
little
feet
on
the
virgin
snow
,
and
he
followed
*NL*
their
track
to
the
furze
bushes
.
``
Mammy
!
''
the
little
one
cried
again
*NL*
and
again
,
stretching
itself
forward
so
as
almost
to
escape
from
*NL*
Silas
's
arms
,
before
he
himself
was
aware
that
there
was
something
more
*NL*
than
the
bush
before
him
--
that
there
was
a
human
body
,
with
the
head
*NL*
sunk
low
in
the
furze
,
and
half-covered
with
the
shaken
snow
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
the
early
supper-time
at
the
Red
House
,
and
the
*NL*
entertainment
was
in
that
stage
when
bashfulness
itself
had
passed
into
*NL*
easy
jollity
,
when
gentlemen
,
conscious
of
unusual
accomplishments
,
*NL*
could
at
length
be
prevailed
on
to
dance
a
hornpipe
,
and
when
the
*NL*
Squire
preferred
talking
loudly
,
scattering
snuff
,
and
patting
his
*NL*
visitors
'
backs
,
to
sitting
longer
at
the
whist-table
--
a
choice
*NL*
exasperating
to
uncle
Kimble
,
who
,
being
always
volatile
in
sober
*NL*
business
hours
,
became
intense
and
bitter
over
cards
and
brandy
,
*NL*
shuffled
before
his
adversary
's
deal
with
a
glare
of
suspicion
,
and
*NL*
turned
up
a
mean
trump-card
with
an
air
of
inexpressible
disgust
,
as
if
*NL*
in
a
world
where
such
things
could
happen
one
might
as
well
enter
on
a
*NL*
course
of
reckless
profligacy
.
When
the
evening
had
advanced
to
this
*NL*
pitch
of
freedom
and
enjoyment
,
it
was
usual
for
the
servants
,
the
*NL*
heavy
duties
of
supper
being
well
over
,
to
get
their
share
of
amusement
*NL*
by
coming
to
look
on
at
the
dancing
;
so
that
the
back
regions
of
the
*NL*
house
were
left
in
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
doors
by
which
the
White
Parlour
was
entered
from
the
*NL*
hall
,
and
they
were
both
standing
open
for
the
sake
of
air
;
but
the
*NL*
lower
one
was
crowded
with
the
servants
and
villagers
,
and
only
the
*NL*
upper
doorway
was
left
free
.
Bob
Cass
was
figuring
in
a
hornpipe
,
and
*NL*
his
father
,
very
proud
of
this
lithe
son
,
whom
he
repeatedly
declared
*NL*
to
be
just
like
himself
in
his
young
days
in
a
tone
that
implied
this
*NL*
to
be
the
very
highest
stamp
of
juvenile
merit
,
was
the
centre
of
a
*NL*
group
who
had
placed
themselves
opposite
the
performer
,
not
far
from
*NL*
the
upper
door
.
Godfrey
was
standing
a
little
way
off
,
not
to
admire
*NL*
his
brother
's
dancing
,
but
to
keep
sight
of
Nancy
,
who
was
seated
in
*NL*
the
group
,
near
her
father
.
He
stood
aloof
,
because
he
wished
to
avoid
*NL*
suggesting
himself
as
a
subject
for
the
Squire
's
fatherly
jokes
in
*NL*
connection
with
matrimony
and
Miss
Nancy
Lammeter
's
beauty
,
which
were
*NL*
likely
to
become
more
and
more
explicit
.
But
he
had
the
prospect
of
*NL*
dancing
with
her
again
when
the
hornpipe
was
concluded
,
and
in
the
*NL*
meanwhile
it
was
very
pleasant
to
get
long
glances
at
her
quite
*NL*
unobserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Godfrey
was
lifting
his
eyes
from
one
of
those
long
glances
,
*NL*
they
encountered
an
object
as
startling
to
him
at
that
moment
as
if
it
*NL*
had
been
an
apparition
from
the
dead
.
It
_
was
_
an
apparition
from
that
*NL*
hidden
life
which
lies
,
like
a
dark
by-street
,
behind
the
goodly
*NL*
ornamented
facade
that
meets
the
sunlight
and
the
gaze
of
respectable
*NL*
admirers
.
It
was
his
own
child
,
carried
in
Silas
Marner
's
arms
.
That
*NL*
was
his
instantaneous
impression
,
unaccompanied
by
doubt
,
though
he
had
*NL*
not
seen
the
child
for
months
past
;
and
when
the
hope
was
rising
that
*NL*
he
might
possibly
be
mistaken
,
Mr.
Crackenthorp
and
Mr.
Lammeter
had
*NL*
already
advanced
to
Silas
,
in
astonishment
at
this
strange
advent
.
*NL*
Godfrey
joined
them
immediately
,
unable
to
rest
without
hearing
every
*NL*
word
--
trying
to
control
himself
,
but
conscious
that
if
any
one
noticed
*NL*
him
,
they
must
see
that
he
was
white-lipped
and
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
all
eyes
at
that
end
of
the
room
were
bent
on
Silas
Marner
;
the
*NL*
Squire
himself
had
risen
,
and
asked
angrily
,
``
How
's
this
?
--
what
's
*NL*
this
?
--
what
do
you
do
coming
in
here
in
this
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
come
for
the
doctor
--
I
want
the
doctor
,
''
Silas
had
said
,
in
the
*NL*
first
moment
,
to
Mr.
Crackenthorp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
,
Marner
?
''
said
the
rector
.
``
The
doctor
's
*NL*
here
;
but
say
quietly
what
you
want
him
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
woman
,
''
said
Silas
,
speaking
low
,
and
half-breathlessly
,
just
*NL*
as
Godfrey
came
up
.
``
She
's
dead
,
I
think
--
dead
in
the
snow
at
the
*NL*
Stone-pits
--
not
far
from
my
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
felt
a
great
throb
:
there
was
one
terror
in
his
mind
at
that
*NL*
moment
:
it
was
,
that
the
woman
might
_
not
_
be
dead
.
That
was
an
evil
*NL*
terror
--
an
ugly
inmate
to
have
found
a
nestling-place
in
Godfrey
's
*NL*
kindly
disposition
;
but
no
disposition
is
a
security
from
evil
wishes
*NL*
to
a
man
whose
happiness
hangs
on
duplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
hush
!
''
said
Mr.
Crackenthorp
.
``
Go
out
into
the
hall
there
.
*NL*
I
'll
fetch
the
doctor
to
you
.
Found
a
woman
in
the
snow
--
and
thinks
*NL*
she
's
dead
,
''
he
added
,
speaking
low
to
the
Squire
.
``
Better
say
as
*NL*
little
about
it
as
possible
:
it
will
shock
the
ladies
.
Just
tell
them
*NL*
a
poor
woman
is
ill
from
cold
and
hunger
.
I
'll
go
and
fetch
Kimble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
,
however
,
the
ladies
had
pressed
forward
,
curious
to
know
*NL*
what
could
have
brought
the
solitary
linen-weaver
there
under
such
*NL*
strange
circumstances
,
and
interested
in
the
pretty
child
,
who
,
half
*NL*
alarmed
and
half
attracted
by
the
brightness
and
the
numerous
company
,
*NL*
now
frowned
and
hid
her
face
,
now
lifted
up
her
head
again
and
looked
*NL*
round
placably
,
until
a
touch
or
a
coaxing
word
brought
back
the
frown
,
*NL*
and
made
her
bury
her
face
with
new
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
child
is
it
?
''
said
several
ladies
at
once
,
and
,
among
the
rest
,
*NL*
Nancy
Lammeter
,
addressing
Godfrey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
some
poor
woman
's
who
has
been
found
in
the
snow
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
''
was
the
answer
Godfrey
wrung
from
himself
with
a
terrible
*NL*
effort
.
-LRB-
``
After
all
,
_
am
_
I
certain
?
''
he
hastened
to
add
,
silently
,
*NL*
in
anticipation
of
his
own
conscience
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
'd
better
leave
the
child
here
,
then
,
Master
Marner
,
''
said
*NL*
good-natured
Mrs.
Kimble
,
hesitating
,
however
,
to
take
those
dingy
*NL*
clothes
into
contact
with
her
own
ornamented
satin
bodice
.
``
I
'll
tell
*NL*
one
o
'
the
girls
to
fetch
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
no
--
I
ca
n't
part
with
it
,
I
ca
n't
let
it
go
,
''
said
Silas
,
*NL*
abruptly
.
``
It
's
come
to
me
--
I
've
a
right
to
keep
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
proposition
to
take
the
child
from
him
had
come
to
Silas
quite
*NL*
unexpectedly
,
and
his
speech
,
uttered
under
a
strong
sudden
impulse
,
*NL*
was
almost
like
a
revelation
to
himself
:
a
minute
before
,
he
had
no
*NL*
distinct
intention
about
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
hear
the
like
?
''
said
Mrs.
Kimble
,
in
mild
surprise
,
to
*NL*
her
neighbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
ladies
,
I
must
trouble
you
to
stand
aside
,
''
said
Mr.
Kimble
,
*NL*
coming
from
the
card-room
,
in
some
bitterness
at
the
interruption
,
but
*NL*
drilled
by
the
long
habit
of
his
profession
into
obedience
to
*NL*
unpleasant
calls
,
even
when
he
was
hardly
sober
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
nasty
business
turning
out
now
,
eh
,
Kimble
?
''
said
the
Squire
.
*NL*
``
He
might
ha
'
gone
for
your
young
fellow
--
the
`
prentice
,
there
--
what
's
*NL*
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
?
aye
--
what
's
the
use
of
talking
about
might
?
''
growled
uncle
*NL*
Kimble
,
hastening
out
with
Marner
,
and
followed
by
Mr.
Crackenthorp
and
*NL*
Godfrey
.
``
Get
me
a
pair
of
thick
boots
,
Godfrey
,
will
you
?
And
stay
,
*NL*
let
somebody
run
to
Winthrop
's
and
fetch
Dolly
--
she
's
the
best
woman
to
*NL*
get
.
Ben
was
here
himself
before
supper
;
is
he
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
I
met
him
,
''
said
Marner
;
``
but
I
could
n't
stop
to
tell
him
*NL*
anything
,
only
I
said
I
was
going
for
the
doctor
,
and
he
said
the
*NL*
doctor
was
at
the
Squire
's
.
And
I
made
haste
and
ran
,
and
there
was
*NL*
nobody
to
be
seen
at
the
back
o
'
the
house
,
and
so
I
went
in
to
where
*NL*
the
company
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
,
no
longer
distracted
by
the
bright
light
and
the
smiling
*NL*
women
's
faces
,
began
to
cry
and
call
for
``
mammy
''
,
though
always
*NL*
clinging
to
Marner
,
who
had
apparently
won
her
thorough
confidence
.
*NL*
Godfrey
had
come
back
with
the
boots
,
and
felt
the
cry
as
if
some
fibre
*NL*
were
drawn
tight
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
,
''
he
said
,
hastily
,
eager
for
some
movement
;
``
I
'll
go
and
*NL*
fetch
the
woman
--
Mrs.
Winthrop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
pooh
--
send
somebody
else
,
''
said
uncle
Kimble
,
hurrying
away
with
*NL*
Marner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
let
me
know
if
I
can
be
of
any
use
,
Kimble
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Crackenthorp
.
But
the
doctor
was
out
of
hearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
,
too
,
had
disappeared
:
he
was
gone
to
snatch
his
hat
and
coat
,
*NL*
having
just
reflection
enough
to
remember
that
he
must
not
look
like
a
*NL*
madman
;
but
he
rushed
out
of
the
house
into
the
snow
without
heeding
*NL*
his
thin
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
he
was
on
his
rapid
way
to
the
Stone-pits
by
the
side
*NL*
of
Dolly
,
who
,
though
feeling
that
she
was
entirely
in
her
place
in
*NL*
encountering
cold
and
snow
on
an
errand
of
mercy
,
was
much
concerned
at
*NL*
a
young
gentleman
's
getting
his
feet
wet
under
a
like
impulse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
a
deal
better
go
back
,
sir
,
''
said
Dolly
,
with
respectful
*NL*
compassion
.
``
You
've
no
call
to
catch
cold
;
and
I
'd
ask
you
if
you
'd
be
*NL*
so
good
as
tell
my
husband
to
come
,
on
your
way
back
--
he
's
at
the
*NL*
Rainbow
,
I
doubt
--
if
you
found
him
anyway
sober
enough
to
be
o
'
use
.
*NL*
Or
else
,
there
's
Mrs.
Snell
`
ud
happen
send
the
boy
up
to
fetch
and
*NL*
carry
,
for
there
may
be
things
wanted
from
the
doctor
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'll
stay
,
now
I
'm
once
out
--
I
'll
stay
outside
here
,
''
said
*NL*
Godfrey
,
when
they
came
opposite
Marner
's
cottage
.
``
You
can
come
and
*NL*
tell
me
if
I
can
do
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
you
're
very
good
:
you
've
a
tender
heart
,
''
said
Dolly
,
going
*NL*
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
was
too
painfully
preoccupied
to
feel
a
twinge
of
self-reproach
*NL*
at
this
undeserved
praise
.
He
walked
up
and
down
,
unconscious
that
he
*NL*
was
plunging
ankle-deep
in
snow
,
unconscious
of
everything
but
*NL*
trembling
suspense
about
what
was
going
on
in
the
cottage
,
and
the
*NL*
effect
of
each
alternative
on
his
future
lot
.
No
,
not
quite
*NL*
unconscious
of
everything
else
.
Deeper
down
,
and
half-smothered
by
*NL*
passionate
desire
and
dread
,
there
was
the
sense
that
he
ought
not
to
*NL*
be
waiting
on
these
alternatives
;
that
he
ought
to
accept
the
*NL*
consequences
of
his
deeds
,
own
the
miserable
wife
,
and
fulfil
the
*NL*
claims
of
the
helpless
child
.
But
he
had
not
moral
courage
enough
to
*NL*
contemplate
that
active
renunciation
of
Nancy
as
possible
for
him
:
he
*NL*
had
only
conscience
and
heart
enough
to
make
him
for
ever
uneasy
under
*NL*
the
weakness
that
forbade
the
renunciation
.
And
at
this
moment
his
*NL*
mind
leaped
away
from
all
restraint
toward
the
sudden
prospect
of
*NL*
deliverance
from
his
long
bondage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
dead
?
''
said
the
voice
that
predominated
over
every
other
*NL*
within
him
.
``
If
she
is
,
I
may
marry
Nancy
;
and
then
I
shall
be
a
good
*NL*
fellow
in
future
,
and
have
no
secrets
,
and
the
child
--
shall
be
taken
*NL*
care
of
somehow
.
''
But
across
that
vision
came
the
other
*NL*
possibility
--
``
She
may
live
,
and
then
it
's
all
up
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
never
knew
how
long
it
was
before
the
door
of
the
cottage
*NL*
opened
and
Mr.
Kimble
came
out
.
He
went
forward
to
meet
his
uncle
,
*NL*
prepared
to
suppress
the
agitation
he
must
feel
,
whatever
news
he
was
*NL*
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
waited
for
you
,
as
I
'd
come
so
far
,
''
he
said
,
speaking
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
,
it
was
nonsense
for
you
to
come
out
:
why
did
n't
you
send
one
of
*NL*
the
men
?
There
's
nothing
to
be
done
.
She
's
dead
--
has
been
dead
for
*NL*
hours
,
I
should
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
woman
is
she
?
''
said
Godfrey
,
feeling
the
blood
rush
to
*NL*
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
woman
,
but
emaciated
,
with
long
black
hair
.
Some
*NL*
vagrant
--
quite
in
rags
.
She
's
got
a
wedding-ring
on
,
however
.
They
*NL*
must
fetch
her
away
to
the
workhouse
to-morrow
.
Come
,
come
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
look
at
her
,
''
said
Godfrey
.
``
I
think
I
saw
such
a
woman
*NL*
yesterday
.
I
'll
overtake
you
in
a
minute
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kimble
went
on
,
and
Godfrey
turned
back
to
the
cottage
.
He
cast
*NL*
only
one
glance
at
the
dead
face
on
the
pillow
,
which
Dolly
had
*NL*
smoothed
with
decent
care
;
but
he
remembered
that
last
look
at
his
*NL*
unhappy
hated
wife
so
well
,
that
at
the
end
of
sixteen
years
every
line
*NL*
in
the
worn
face
was
present
to
him
when
he
told
the
full
story
of
this
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
immediately
towards
the
hearth
,
where
Silas
Marner
sat
*NL*
lulling
the
child
.
She
was
perfectly
quiet
now
,
but
not
asleep
--
only
*NL*
soothed
by
sweet
porridge
and
warmth
into
that
wide-gazing
calm
which
*NL*
makes
us
older
human
beings
,
with
our
inward
turmoil
,
feel
a
certain
*NL*
awe
in
the
presence
of
a
little
child
,
such
as
we
feel
before
some
*NL*
quiet
majesty
or
beauty
in
the
earth
or
sky
--
before
a
steady
glowing
*NL*
planet
,
or
a
full-flowered
eglantine
,
or
the
bending
trees
over
a
*NL*
silent
pathway
.
The
wide-open
blue
eyes
looked
up
at
Godfrey
's
without
*NL*
any
uneasiness
or
sign
of
recognition
:
the
child
could
make
no
visible
*NL*
audible
claim
on
its
father
;
and
the
father
felt
a
strange
mixture
of
*NL*
feelings
,
a
conflict
of
regret
and
joy
,
that
the
pulse
of
that
little
*NL*
heart
had
no
response
for
the
half-jealous
yearning
in
his
own
,
when
*NL*
the
blue
eyes
turned
away
from
him
slowly
,
and
fixed
themselves
on
the
*NL*
weaver
's
queer
face
,
which
was
bent
low
down
to
look
at
them
,
while
the
*NL*
small
hand
began
to
pull
Marner
's
withered
cheek
with
loving
*NL*
disfiguration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
take
the
child
to
the
parish
to-morrow
?
''
asked
Godfrey
,
*NL*
speaking
as
indifferently
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
says
so
?
''
said
Marner
,
sharply
.
``
Will
they
make
me
take
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
would
n't
like
to
keep
her
,
should
you
--
an
old
bachelor
like
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
anybody
shows
they
've
a
right
to
take
her
away
from
me
,
''
said
*NL*
Marner
.
``
The
mother
's
dead
,
and
I
reckon
it
's
got
no
father
:
it
's
a
*NL*
lone
thing
--
and
I
'm
a
lone
thing
.
My
money
's
gone
,
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
where
--
and
this
is
come
from
I
do
n't
know
where
.
I
know
nothing
--
I
'm
*NL*
partly
mazed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
thing
!
''
said
Godfrey
.
``
Let
me
give
something
towards
*NL*
finding
it
clothes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
found
half-a-guinea
,
and
,
*NL*
thrusting
it
into
Silas
's
hand
,
he
hurried
out
of
the
cottage
to
*NL*
overtake
Mr.
Kimble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
see
it
's
not
the
same
woman
I
saw
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
came
up
.
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pretty
little
child
:
the
old
fellow
seems
to
want
to
keep
it
;
*NL*
that
's
strange
for
a
miser
like
him
.
But
I
gave
him
a
trifle
to
help
*NL*
him
out
:
the
parish
is
n't
likely
to
quarrel
with
him
for
the
right
to
*NL*
keep
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
I
've
seen
the
time
when
I
might
have
quarrelled
with
him
for
*NL*
it
myself
.
It
's
too
late
now
,
though
.
If
the
child
ran
into
the
fire
,
*NL*
your
aunt
's
too
fat
to
overtake
it
:
she
could
only
sit
and
grunt
like
*NL*
an
alarmed
sow
.
But
what
a
fool
you
are
,
Godfrey
,
to
come
out
in
your
*NL*
dancing
shoes
and
stockings
in
this
way
--
and
you
one
of
the
beaux
of
*NL*
the
evening
,
and
at
your
own
house
!
What
do
you
mean
by
such
freaks
,
*NL*
young
fellow
?
Has
Miss
Nancy
been
cruel
,
and
do
you
want
to
spite
her
*NL*
by
spoiling
your
pumps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
everything
has
been
disagreeable
to-night
.
I
was
tired
to
death
*NL*
of
jigging
and
gallanting
,
and
that
bother
about
the
hornpipes
.
And
*NL*
I
'd
got
to
dance
with
the
other
Miss
Gunn
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
glad
of
the
*NL*
subterfuge
his
uncle
had
suggested
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prevarication
and
white
lies
which
a
mind
that
keeps
itself
*NL*
ambitiously
pure
is
as
uneasy
under
as
a
great
artist
under
the
false
*NL*
touches
that
no
eye
detects
but
his
own
,
are
worn
as
lightly
as
mere
*NL*
trimmings
when
once
the
actions
have
become
a
lie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
reappeared
in
the
White
Parlour
with
dry
feet
,
and
,
since
the
*NL*
truth
must
be
told
,
with
a
sense
of
relief
and
gladness
that
was
too
*NL*
strong
for
painful
thoughts
to
struggle
with
.
For
could
he
not
venture
*NL*
now
,
whenever
opportunity
offered
,
to
say
the
tenderest
things
to
Nancy
*NL*
Lammeter
--
to
promise
her
and
himself
that
he
would
always
be
just
what
*NL*
she
would
desire
to
see
him
?
There
was
no
danger
that
his
dead
wife
*NL*
would
be
recognized
:
those
were
not
days
of
active
inquiry
and
wide
*NL*
report
;
and
as
for
the
registry
of
their
marriage
,
that
was
a
long
way
*NL*
off
,
buried
in
unturned
pages
,
away
from
every
one
's
interest
but
his
*NL*
own
.
Dunsey
might
betray
him
if
he
came
back
;
but
Dunsey
might
be
won
*NL*
to
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
events
turn
out
so
much
better
for
a
man
than
he
has
had
*NL*
reason
to
dread
,
is
it
not
a
proof
that
his
conduct
has
been
less
*NL*
foolish
and
blameworthy
than
it
might
otherwise
have
appeared
?
When
we
*NL*
are
treated
well
,
we
naturally
begin
to
think
that
we
are
not
*NL*
altogether
unmeritorious
,
and
that
it
is
only
just
we
should
treat
*NL*
ourselves
well
,
and
not
mar
our
own
good
fortune
.
Where
,
after
all
,
*NL*
would
be
the
use
of
his
confessing
the
past
to
Nancy
Lammeter
,
and
*NL*
throwing
away
his
happiness
?
--
nay
,
hers
?
for
he
felt
some
confidence
*NL*
that
she
loved
him
.
As
for
the
child
,
he
would
see
that
it
was
cared
*NL*
for
:
he
would
never
forsake
it
;
he
would
do
everything
but
own
it
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
would
be
just
as
happy
in
life
without
being
owned
by
its
*NL*
father
,
seeing
that
nobody
could
tell
how
things
would
turn
out
,
and
*NL*
that
--
is
there
any
other
reason
wanted
?
--
well
,
then
,
that
the
father
*NL*
would
be
much
happier
without
owning
the
child
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pauper
's
burial
that
week
in
Raveloe
,
and
up
Kench
Yard
at
*NL*
Batherley
it
was
known
that
the
dark-haired
woman
with
the
fair
child
,
*NL*
who
had
lately
come
to
lodge
there
,
was
gone
away
again
.
That
was
all
*NL*
the
express
note
taken
that
Molly
had
disappeared
from
the
eyes
of
men
.
*NL*
But
the
unwept
death
which
,
to
the
general
lot
,
seemed
as
trivial
as
*NL*
the
summer-shed
leaf
,
was
charged
with
the
force
of
destiny
to
certain
*NL*
human
lives
that
we
know
of
,
shaping
their
joys
and
sorrows
even
to
the
*NL*
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
Marner
's
determination
to
keep
the
``
tramp
's
child
''
was
matter
of
*NL*
hardly
less
surprise
and
iterated
talk
in
the
village
than
the
robbery
*NL*
of
his
money
.
That
softening
of
feeling
towards
him
which
dated
from
*NL*
his
misfortune
,
that
merging
of
suspicion
and
dislike
in
a
rather
*NL*
contemptuous
pity
for
him
as
lone
and
crazy
,
was
now
accompanied
with
a
*NL*
more
active
sympathy
,
especially
amongst
the
women
.
Notable
mothers
,
*NL*
who
knew
what
it
was
to
keep
children
``
whole
and
sweet
''
;
lazy
mothers
,
*NL*
who
knew
what
it
was
to
be
interrupted
in
folding
their
arms
and
*NL*
scratching
their
elbows
by
the
mischievous
propensities
of
children
*NL*
just
firm
on
their
legs
,
were
equally
interested
in
conjecturing
how
a
*NL*
lone
man
would
manage
with
a
two-year-old
child
on
his
hands
,
and
were
*NL*
equally
ready
with
their
suggestions
:
the
notable
chiefly
telling
him
*NL*
what
he
had
better
do
,
and
the
lazy
ones
being
emphatic
in
telling
him
*NL*
what
he
would
never
be
able
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
notable
mothers
,
Dolly
Winthrop
was
the
one
whose
neighbourly
*NL*
offices
were
the
most
acceptable
to
Marner
,
for
they
were
rendered
*NL*
without
any
show
of
bustling
instruction
.
Silas
had
shown
her
the
*NL*
half-guinea
given
to
him
by
Godfrey
,
and
had
asked
her
what
he
should
*NL*
do
about
getting
some
clothes
for
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
Master
Marner
,
''
said
Dolly
,
``
there
's
no
call
to
buy
,
no
more
nor
a
*NL*
pair
o
'
shoes
;
for
I
've
got
the
little
petticoats
as
Aaron
wore
five
*NL*
years
ago
,
and
it
's
ill
spending
the
money
on
them
baby-clothes
,
for
*NL*
the
child
`
ull
grow
like
grass
i
'
May
,
bless
it
--
that
it
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
same
day
Dolly
brought
her
bundle
,
and
displayed
to
Marner
,
one
*NL*
by
one
,
the
tiny
garments
in
their
due
order
of
succession
,
most
of
*NL*
them
patched
and
darned
,
but
clean
and
neat
as
fresh-sprung
herbs
.
*NL*
This
was
the
introduction
to
a
great
ceremony
with
soap
and
water
,
from
*NL*
which
Baby
came
out
in
new
beauty
,
and
sat
on
Dolly
's
knee
,
handling
*NL*
her
toes
and
chuckling
and
patting
her
palms
together
with
an
air
of
*NL*
having
made
several
discoveries
about
herself
,
which
she
communicated
*NL*
by
alternate
sounds
of
``
gug-gug-gug
''
,
and
``
mammy
''
.
The
``
mammy
''
was
not
*NL*
a
cry
of
need
or
uneasiness
:
Baby
had
been
used
to
utter
it
without
*NL*
expecting
either
tender
sound
or
touch
to
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anybody
`
ud
think
the
angils
in
heaven
could
n't
be
prettier
,
''
said
*NL*
Dolly
,
rubbing
the
golden
curls
and
kissing
them
.
``
And
to
think
of
its
*NL*
being
covered
wi
'
them
dirty
rags
--
and
the
poor
mother
--
froze
to
death
;
*NL*
but
there
's
Them
as
took
care
of
it
,
and
brought
it
to
your
door
,
*NL*
Master
Marner
.
The
door
was
open
,
and
it
walked
in
over
the
snow
,
like
*NL*
as
if
it
had
been
a
little
starved
robin
.
Did
n't
you
say
the
door
was
*NL*
open
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Silas
,
meditatively
.
``
Yes
--
the
door
was
open
.
The
money
's
*NL*
gone
I
do
n't
know
where
,
and
this
is
come
from
I
do
n't
know
where
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
mentioned
to
any
one
his
unconsciousness
of
the
child
's
*NL*
entrance
,
shrinking
from
questions
which
might
lead
to
the
fact
he
*NL*
himself
suspected
--
namely
,
that
he
had
been
in
one
of
his
trances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Dolly
,
with
soothing
gravity
,
``
it
's
like
the
night
and
the
*NL*
morning
,
and
the
sleeping
and
the
waking
,
and
the
rain
and
the
*NL*
harvest
--
one
goes
and
the
other
comes
,
and
we
know
nothing
how
nor
*NL*
where
.
We
may
strive
and
scrat
and
fend
,
but
it
's
little
we
can
do
*NL*
arter
all
--
the
big
things
come
and
go
wi
'
no
striving
o
'
our
`
n
--
they
*NL*
do
,
that
they
do
;
and
I
think
you
're
in
the
right
on
it
to
keep
the
*NL*
little
un
,
Master
Marner
,
seeing
as
it
's
been
sent
to
you
,
though
*NL*
there
's
folks
as
thinks
different
.
You
'll
happen
be
a
bit
moithered
*NL*
with
it
while
it
's
so
little
;
but
I
'll
come
,
and
welcome
,
and
see
to
it
*NL*
for
you
:
I
've
a
bit
o
'
time
to
spare
most
days
,
for
when
one
gets
up
*NL*
betimes
i
'
the
morning
,
the
clock
seems
to
stan
'
still
tow
`
rt
ten
,
*NL*
afore
it
's
time
to
go
about
the
victual
.
So
,
as
I
say
,
I
'll
come
and
*NL*
see
to
the
child
for
you
,
and
welcome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
...
kindly
,
''
said
Silas
,
hesitating
a
little
.
``
I
'll
be
glad
*NL*
if
you
'll
tell
me
things
.
But
,
''
he
added
,
uneasily
,
leaning
forward
to
*NL*
look
at
Baby
with
some
jealousy
,
as
she
was
resting
her
head
backward
*NL*
against
Dolly
's
arm
,
and
eyeing
him
contentedly
from
a
distance
--
``
But
I
*NL*
want
to
do
things
for
it
myself
,
else
it
may
get
fond
o
'
somebody
else
,
*NL*
and
not
fond
o
'
me
.
I
've
been
used
to
fending
for
myself
in
the
*NL*
house
--
I
can
learn
,
I
can
learn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Dolly
,
gently
.
``
I
've
seen
men
as
are
wonderful
*NL*
handy
wi

children

The
men
are
awk

and
contrairy
mostly
,
God
help
*NL*
'em
--
but
when
the
drink
's
out
of
'em
,
they
are
n't
unsensible
,
though
*NL*
they
're
bad
for
leeching
and
bandaging
--
so
fiery
and
unpatient
.
You
*NL*
see
this
goes
first
,
next
the
skin
,
''
proceeded
Dolly
,
taking
up
the
*NL*
little
shirt
,
and
putting
it
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Marner
,
docilely
,
bringing
his
eyes
very
close
,
that
they
*NL*
might
be
initiated
in
the
mysteries
;
whereupon
Baby
seized
his
head
*NL*
with
both
her
small
arms
,
and
put
her
lips
against
his
face
with
*NL*
purring
noises
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
there
,
''
said
Dolly
,
with
a
woman
's
tender
tact
,
``
she
's
fondest
o
'
*NL*
you
.
She
wants
to
go
o
'
your
lap
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
Go
,
then
:
take
her
,
*NL*
Master
Marner
;
you
can
put
the
things
on
,
and
then
you
can
say
as
*NL*
you
've
done
for
her
from
the
first
of
her
coming
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marner
took
her
on
his
lap
,
trembling
with
an
emotion
mysterious
to
*NL*
himself
,
at
something
unknown
dawning
on
his
life
.
Thought
and
feeling
*NL*
were
so
confused
within
him
,
that
if
he
had
tried
to
give
them
*NL*
utterance
,
he
could
only
have
said
that
the
child
was
come
instead
of
*NL*
the
gold
--
that
the
gold
had
turned
into
the
child
.
He
took
the
*NL*
garments
from
Dolly
,
and
put
them
on
under
her
teaching
;
interrupted
,
*NL*
of
course
,
by
Baby
's
gymnastics
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
then
!
why
,
you
take
to
it
quite
easy
,
Master
Marner
,
''
said
*NL*
Dolly
;
``
but
what
shall
you
do
when
you
're
forced
to
sit
in
your
loom
?
*NL*
For
she
'll
get
busier
and
mischievouser
every
day
--
she
will
,
bless
her
.
*NL*
It
's
lucky
as
you
've
got
that
high
hearth
i
`
stead
of
a
grate
,
for
that
*NL*
keeps
the
fire
more
out
of
her
reach
:
but
if
you
've
got
anything
as
can
*NL*
be
spilt
or
broke
,
or
as
is
fit
to
cut
her
fingers
off
,
she
'll
be
at
*NL*
it

and
it
is
but
right
you
should
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
meditated
a
little
while
in
some
perplexity
.
``
I
'll
tie
her
to
*NL*
the
leg
o
'
the
loom
,
''
he
said
at
last
--
``
tie
her
with
a
good
long
strip
*NL*
o
'
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
mayhap
that
'll
do
,
as
it
's
a
little
gell
,
for
they
're
easier
*NL*
persuaded
to
sit
i
'
one
place
nor
the
lads
.
I
know
what
the
lads
are
;
*NL*
for
I
've
had
four
--
four
I
've
had
,
God
knows
--
and
if
you
was
to
take
and
*NL*
tie
'em
up
,
they
'd
make
a
fighting
and
a
crying
as
if
you
was
ringing
*NL*
the
pigs

But
I
'll
bring
you
my
little
chair

some
bits

red
rag
*NL*

things
for

to
play

'll
sit
and
chatter
to

alive

a
sin
to
the
lads

I
should
ha

been
glad
for
one
of
'em
to
be
a

little
gell

to
think
as
I
could
ha

taught
her
to
scour

mend
,

the
knitting

everything

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
'll
be

Marner
,
rather
hastily

to
be
sure
;
you
'll
have
a
right
to
her
,
if
you
're
a
father
to
her
,
*NL*
and
bring
her
up
according
.
But
,
''
added
Dolly
,
coming
to
a
point
which
*NL*
she
had
determined
beforehand
to
touch
upon
,
``
you
must
bring
her
up
*NL*
like
christened
folks
's
children
,
and
take
her
to
church
,
and
let
her
*NL*
learn
her
catechise
,
as
my
little
Aaron
can
say
off
--
the
``
I
believe
''
,
*NL*
and
everything
,
and
``
hurt
nobody
by
word
or
deed
''
,
--
as
well
as
if
he
*NL*
was
the
clerk
.
That
's
what
you
must
do
,
Master
Marner
,
if
you
'd
do
the
*NL*
right
thing
by
the
orphin
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marner
's
pale
face
flushed
suddenly
under
a
new
anxiety
.
His
mind
was
*NL*
too
busy
trying
to
give
some
definite
bearing
to
Dolly
's
words
for
him
*NL*
to
think
of
answering
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
's
my
belief
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
as
the
poor
little
creatur
has
*NL*
never
been
christened
,
and
it
's
nothing
but
right
as
the
parson
should
*NL*
be
spoke
to
;
and
if
you
was
noways
unwilling
,
I
'd
talk
to
Mr.
Macey
*NL*
about
it
this
very
day
.
For
if
the
child
ever
went
anyways
wrong
,
and
*NL*
you
had
n't
done
your
part
by
it
,
Master
Marner
--
`
noculation
,
and
*NL*
everything
to
save
it
from
harm
--
it
`
ud
be
a
thorn
i
'
your
bed
for
ever
*NL*
o
'
this
side
the
grave
;
and
I
ca
n't
think
as
it
`
ud
be
easy
lying
down
*NL*
for
anybody
when
they
'd
got
to
another
world
,
if
they
had
n't
done
their
*NL*
part
by
the
helpless
children
as
come
wi'out
their
own
asking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
herself
was
disposed
to
be
silent
for
some
time
now
,
for
she
had
*NL*
spoken
from
the
depths
of
her
own
simple
belief
,
and
was
much
concerned
*NL*
to
know
whether
her
words
would
produce
the
desired
effect
on
Silas
.
*NL*
He
was
puzzled
and
anxious
,
for
Dolly
's
word
``
christened
''
conveyed
no
*NL*
distinct
meaning
to
him
.
He
had
only
heard
of
baptism
,
and
had
only
*NL*
seen
the
baptism
of
grown-up
men
and
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
as
you
mean
by
``
christened
''
?
''
he
said
at
last
,
timidly
.
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
folks
be
good
to
her
without
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
!
Master
Marner
,
''
said
Dolly
,
with
gentle
distress
and
*NL*
compassion
.
``
Had
you
never
no
father
nor
mother
as
taught
you
to
say
*NL*
your
prayers
,
and
as
there
's
good
words
and
good
things
to
keep
us
from
*NL*
harm
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Silas
,
in
a
low
voice
;
``
I
know
a
deal
about
that
--
used
to
,
*NL*
used
to
.
But
your
ways
are
different
:
my
country
was
a
good
way
off
.
''
*NL*
He
paused
a
few
moments
,
and
then
added
,
more
decidedly
,
``
But
I
want
to
*NL*
do
everything
as
can
be
done
for
the
child
.
And
whatever
's
right
for
*NL*
it
i
'
this
country
,
and
you
think
`
ull
do
it
good
,
I
'll
act
according
,
*NL*
if
you
'll
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
Master
Marner
,
''
said
Dolly
,
inwardly
rejoiced
,
``
I
'll
ask
*NL*
Mr.
Macey
to
speak
to
the
parson
about
it
;
and
you
must
fix
on
a
name
*NL*
for
it
,
because
it
must
have
a
name
giv
'
it
when
it
's
christened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
's
name
was
Hephzibah
,
''
said
Silas
,
``
and
my
little
sister
was
*NL*
named
after
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
that
's
a
hard
name
,
''
said
Dolly
.
``
I
partly
think
it
is
n't
a
*NL*
christened
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
Bible
name
,
''
said
Silas
,
old
ideas
recurring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
've
no
call
to
speak
again
'
it
,
''
said
Dolly
,
rather
startled
by
*NL*
Silas
's
knowledge
on
this
head
;
``
but
you
see
I
'm
no
scholard
,
and
I
'm
*NL*
slow
at
catching
the
words
.
My
husband
says
I
'm
allays
like
as
if
I
*NL*
was
putting
the
haft
for
the
handle
--
that
's
what
he
says
--
for
he
's
very
*NL*
sharp
,
God
help
him
.
But
it
was
awk
`
ard
calling
your
little
sister
by
*NL*
such
a
hard
name
,
when
you
'd
got
nothing
big
to
say
,
like
--
was
n't
it
,
*NL*
Master
Marner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
called
her
Eppie
,
''
said
Silas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
it
was
noways
wrong
to
shorten
the
name
,
it
`
ud
be
a
deal
*NL*
handier
.
And
so
I
'll
go
now
,
Master
Marner
,
and
I
'll
speak
about
the
*NL*
christening
afore
dark
;
and
I
wish
you
the
best
o

luck
,
and
it
's
my
*NL*
belief
as
it
'll
come
to
you
,
if
you
do
what
's
right
by
the
orphin
*NL*
child
;
--
and
there
's
the
`
noculation
to
be
seen
to
;
and
as
to
washing
*NL*
its
bits
o
'
things
,
you
need
look
to
nobody
but
me
,
for
I
can
do
'em
*NL*
wi
'
one
hand
when
I
've
got
my
suds
about
.
Eh
,
the
blessed
angil
!
*NL*
You
'll
let
me
bring
my
Aaron
one
o
'
these
days
,
and
he
'll
show
her
his
*NL*
little
cart
as
his
father
's
made
for
him
,
and
the
black-and-white
pup
*NL*
as
he
's
got
a-rearing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Baby
_
was
_
christened
,
the
rector
deciding
that
a
double
baptism
was
*NL*
the
lesser
risk
to
incur
;
and
on
this
occasion
Silas
,
making
himself
as
*NL*
clean
and
tidy
as
he
could
,
appeared
for
the
first
time
within
the
*NL*
church
,
and
shared
in
the
observances
held
sacred
by
his
neighbours
.
*NL*
He
was
quite
unable
,
by
means
of
anything
he
heard
or
saw
,
to
identify
*NL*
the
Raveloe
religion
with
his
old
faith
;
if
he
could
at
any
time
in
his
*NL*
previous
life
have
done
so
,
it
must
have
been
by
the
aid
of
a
strong
*NL*
feeling
ready
to
vibrate
with
sympathy
,
rather
than
by
a
comparison
of
*NL*
phrases
and
ideas
:
and
now
for
long
years
that
feeling
had
been
*NL*
dormant
.
He
had
no
distinct
idea
about
the
baptism
and
the
*NL*
church-going
,
except
that
Dolly
had
said
it
was
for
the
good
of
the
*NL*
child
;
and
in
this
way
,
as
the
weeks
grew
to
months
,
the
child
created
*NL*
fresh
and
fresh
links
between
his
life
and
the
lives
from
which
he
had
*NL*
hitherto
shrunk
continually
into
narrower
isolation
.
Unlike
the
gold
*NL*
which
needed
nothing
,
and
must
be
worshipped
in
close-locked
*NL*
solitude
--
which
was
hidden
away
from
the
daylight
,
was
deaf
to
the
song
*NL*
of
birds
,
and
started
to
no
human
tones
--
Eppie
was
a
creature
of
*NL*
endless
claims
and
ever-growing
desires
,
seeking
and
loving
sunshine
,
*NL*
and
living
sounds
,
and
living
movements
;
making
trial
of
everything
,
*NL*
with
trust
in
new
joy
,
and
stirring
the
human
kindness
in
all
eyes
that
*NL*
looked
on
her
.
The
gold
had
kept
his
thoughts
in
an
ever-repeated
*NL*
circle
,
leading
to
nothing
beyond
itself
;
but
Eppie
was
an
object
*NL*
compacted
of
changes
and
hopes
that
forced
his
thoughts
onward
,
and
*NL*
carried
them
far
away
from
their
old
eager
pacing
towards
the
same
*NL*
blank
limit
--
carried
them
away
to
the
new
things
that
would
come
with
*NL*
the
coming
years
,
when
Eppie
would
have
learned
to
understand
how
her
*NL*
father
Silas
cared
for
her
;
and
made
him
look
for
images
of
that
time
*NL*
in
the
ties
and
charities
that
bound
together
the
families
of
his
*NL*
neighbours
.
The
gold
had
asked
that
he
should
sit
weaving
longer
and
*NL*
longer
,
deafened
and
blinded
more
and
more
to
all
things
except
the
*NL*
monotony
of
his
loom
and
the
repetition
of
his
web
;
but
Eppie
called
*NL*
him
away
from
his
weaving
,
and
made
him
think
all
its
pauses
a
holiday
,
*NL*
reawakening
his
senses
with
her
fresh
life
,
even
to
the
old
*NL*
winter-flies
that
came
crawling
forth
in
the
early
spring
sunshine
,
and
*NL*
warming
him
into
joy
because
_
she
_
had
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
the
sunshine
grew
strong
and
lasting
,
so
that
the
buttercups
*NL*
were
thick
in
the
meadows
,
Silas
might
be
seen
in
the
sunny
midday
,
or
*NL*
in
the
late
afternoon
when
the
shadows
were
lengthening
under
the
*NL*
hedgerows
,
strolling
out
with
uncovered
head
to
carry
Eppie
beyond
the
*NL*
Stone-pits
to
where
the
flowers
grew
,
till
they
reached
some
favourite
*NL*
bank
where
he
could
sit
down
,
while
Eppie
toddled
to
pluck
the
flowers
,
*NL*
and
make
remarks
to
the
winged
things
that
murmured
happily
above
the
*NL*
bright
petals
,
calling
``
Dad-dad
's
''
attention
continually
by
bringing
*NL*
him
the
flowers
.
Then
she
would
turn
her
ear
to
some
sudden
bird-note
,
*NL*
and
Silas
learned
to
please
her
by
making
signs
of
hushed
stillness
,
*NL*
that
they
might
listen
for
the
note
to
come
again
:
so
that
when
it
*NL*
came
,
she
set
up
her
small
back
and
laughed
with
gurgling
triumph
.
*NL*
Sitting
on
the
banks
in
this
way
,
Silas
began
to
look
for
the
once
*NL*
familiar
herbs
again
;
and
as
the
leaves
,
with
their
unchanged
outline
*NL*
and
markings
,
lay
on
his
palm
,
there
was
a
sense
of
crowding
*NL*
remembrances
from
which
he
turned
away
timidly
,
taking
refuge
in
*NL*
Eppie
's
little
world
,
that
lay
lightly
on
his
enfeebled
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
child
's
mind
was
growing
into
knowledge
,
his
mind
was
growing
*NL*
into
memory
:
as
her
life
unfolded
,
his
soul
,
long
stupefied
in
a
cold
*NL*
narrow
prison
,
was
unfolding
too
,
and
trembling
gradually
into
full
*NL*
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
influence
which
must
gather
force
with
every
new
year
:
the
*NL*
tones
that
stirred
Silas
's
heart
grew
articulate
,
and
called
for
more
*NL*
distinct
answers
;
shapes
and
sounds
grew
clearer
for
Eppie
's
eyes
and
*NL*
ears
,
and
there
was
more
that
``
Dad-dad
''
was
imperatively
required
to
*NL*
notice
and
account
for
.
Also
,
by
the
time
Eppie
was
three
years
old
,
*NL*
she
developed
a
fine
capacity
for
mischief
,
and
for
devising
ingenious
*NL*
ways
of
being
troublesome
,
which
found
much
exercise
,
not
only
for
*NL*
Silas
's
patience
,
but
for
his
watchfulness
and
penetration
.
Sorely
was
*NL*
poor
Silas
puzzled
on
such
occasions
by
the
incompatible
demands
of
*NL*
love
.
Dolly
Winthrop
told
him
that
punishment
was
good
for
Eppie
,
and
*NL*
that
,
as
for
rearing
a
child
without
making
it
tingle
a
little
in
soft
*NL*
and
safe
places
now
and
then
,
it
was
not
to
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
there
's
another
thing
you
might
do
,
Master
Marner
,
''
added
*NL*
Dolly
,
meditatively
:
``
you
might
shut
her
up
once
i
'
the
coal-hole
.
*NL*
That
was
what
I
did
wi
'
Aaron
;
for
I
was
that
silly
wi
'
the
youngest
*NL*
lad
,
as
I
could
never
bear
to
smack
him
.
Not
as
I
could
find
i
'
my
*NL*
heart
to
let
him
stay
i
'
the
coal-hole
more
nor
a
minute
,
but
it
was
*NL*
enough
to
colly
him
all
over
,
so
as
he
must
be
new
washed
and
dressed
,
*NL*
and
it
was
as
good
as
a
rod
to
him
--
that
was
.
But
I
put
it
upo
'
your
*NL*
conscience
,
Master
Marner
,
as
there
's
one
of
'em
you
must
*NL*
choose
--
ayther
smacking
or
the
coal-hole
--
else
she
'll
get
so
masterful
,
*NL*
there
'll
be
no
holding
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
was
impressed
with
the
melancholy
truth
of
this
last
remark
;
but
*NL*
his
force
of
mind
failed
before
the
only
two
penal
methods
open
to
him
,
*NL*
not
only
because
it
was
painful
to
him
to
hurt
Eppie
,
but
because
he
*NL*
trembled
at
a
moment
's
contention
with
her
,
lest
she
should
love
him
*NL*
the
less
for
it
.
Let
even
an
affectionate
Goliath
get
himself
tied
to
*NL*
a
small
tender
thing
,
dreading
to
hurt
it
by
pulling
,
and
dreading
*NL*
still
more
to
snap
the
cord
,
and
which
of
the
two
,
pray
,
will
be
*NL*
master
?
It
was
clear
that
Eppie
,
with
her
short
toddling
steps
,
must
*NL*
lead
father
Silas
a
pretty
dance
on
any
fine
morning
when
circumstances
*NL*
favoured
mischief
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
example
.
He
had
wisely
chosen
a
broad
strip
of
linen
as
a
means
of
*NL*
fastening
her
to
his
loom
when
he
was
busy
:
it
made
a
broad
belt
round
*NL*
her
waist
,
and
was
long
enough
to
allow
of
her
reaching
the
truckle-bed
*NL*
and
sitting
down
on
it
,
but
not
long
enough
for
her
to
attempt
any
*NL*
dangerous
climbing
.
One
bright
summer
's
morning
Silas
had
been
more
*NL*
engrossed
than
usual
in
``
setting
up
''
a
new
piece
of
work
,
an
occasion
*NL*
on
which
his
scissors
were
in
requisition
.
These
scissors
,
owing
to
an
*NL*
especial
warning
of
Dolly
's
,
had
been
kept
carefully
out
of
Eppie
's
*NL*
reach
;
but
the
click
of
them
had
had
a
peculiar
attraction
for
her
ear
,
*NL*
and
watching
the
results
of
that
click
,
she
had
derived
the
philosophic
*NL*
lesson
that
the
same
cause
would
produce
the
same
effect
.
Silas
had
*NL*
seated
himself
in
his
loom
,
and
the
noise
of
weaving
had
begun
;
but
he
*NL*
had
left
his
scissors
on
a
ledge
which
Eppie
's
arm
was
long
enough
to
*NL*
reach
;
and
now
,
like
a
small
mouse
,
watching
her
opportunity
,
she
stole
*NL*
quietly
from
her
corner
,
secured
the
scissors
,
and
toddled
to
the
bed
*NL*
again
,
setting
up
her
back
as
a
mode
of
concealing
the
fact
.
She
had
a
*NL*
distinct
intention
as
to
the
use
of
the
scissors
;
and
having
cut
the
*NL*
linen
strip
in
a
jagged
but
effectual
manner
,
in
two
moments
she
had
*NL*
run
out
at
the
open
door
where
the
sunshine
was
inviting
her
,
while
*NL*
poor
Silas
believed
her
to
be
a
better
child
than
usual
.
It
was
not
*NL*
until
he
happened
to
need
his
scissors
that
the
terrible
fact
burst
*NL*
upon
him
:
Eppie
had
run
out
by
herself
--
had
perhaps
fallen
into
the
*NL*
Stone-pit
.
Silas
,
shaken
by
the
worst
fear
that
could
have
befallen
*NL*
him
,
rushed
out
,
calling
``
Eppie
!
''
and
ran
eagerly
about
the
unenclosed
*NL*
space
,
exploring
the
dry
cavities
into
which
she
might
have
fallen
,
and
*NL*
then
gazing
with
questioning
dread
at
the
smooth
red
surface
of
the
*NL*
water
.
The
cold
drops
stood
on
his
brow
.
How
long
had
she
been
out
?
*NL*
There
was
one
hope
--
that
she
had
crept
through
the
stile
and
got
into
*NL*
the
fields
,
where
he
habitually
took
her
to
stroll
.
But
the
grass
was
*NL*
high
in
the
meadow
,
and
there
was
no
descrying
her
,
if
she
were
there
,
*NL*
except
by
a
close
search
that
would
be
a
trespass
on
Mr.
Osgood
's
crop
.
*NL*
Still
,
that
misdemeanour
must
be
committed
;
and
poor
Silas
,
after
*NL*
peering
all
round
the
hedgerows
,
traversed
the
grass
,
beginning
with
*NL*
perturbed
vision
to
see
Eppie
behind
every
group
of
red
sorrel
,
and
to
*NL*
see
her
moving
always
farther
off
as
he
approached
.
The
meadow
was
*NL*
searched
in
vain
;
and
he
got
over
the
stile
into
the
next
field
,
*NL*
looking
with
dying
hope
towards
a
small
pond
which
was
now
reduced
to
*NL*
its
summer
shallowness
,
so
as
to
leave
a
wide
margin
of
good
adhesive
*NL*
mud
.
Here
,
however
,
sat
Eppie
,
discoursing
cheerfully
to
her
own
small
*NL*
boot
,
which
she
was
using
as
a
bucket
to
convey
the
water
into
a
deep
*NL*
hoof-mark
,
while
her
little
naked
foot
was
planted
comfortably
on
a
*NL*
cushion
of
olive-green
mud
.
A
red-headed
calf
was
observing
her
with
*NL*
alarmed
doubt
through
the
opposite
hedge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
clearly
a
case
of
aberration
in
a
christened
child
which
*NL*
demanded
severe
treatment
;
but
Silas
,
overcome
with
convulsive
joy
at
*NL*
finding
his
treasure
again
,
could
do
nothing
but
snatch
her
up
,
and
*NL*
cover
her
with
half-sobbing
kisses
.
It
was
not
until
he
had
carried
*NL*
her
home
,
and
had
begun
to
think
of
the
necessary
washing
,
that
he
*NL*
recollected
the
need
that
he
should
punish
Eppie
,
and
``
make
her
*NL*
remember
''
.
The
idea
that
she
might
run
away
again
and
come
to
harm
,
*NL*
gave
him
unusual
resolution
,
and
for
the
first
time
he
determined
to
*NL*
try
the
coal-hole
--
a
small
closet
near
the
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naughty
,
naughty
Eppie
,
''
he
suddenly
began
,
holding
her
on
his
knee
,
*NL*
and
pointing
to
her
muddy
feet
and
clothes
--
``
naughty
to
cut
with
the
*NL*
scissors
and
run
away
.
Eppie
must
go
into
the
coal-hole
for
being
*NL*
naughty
.
Daddy
must
put
her
in
the
coal-hole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
half-expected
that
this
would
be
shock
enough
,
and
that
Eppie
would
*NL*
begin
to
cry
.
But
instead
of
that
,
she
began
to
shake
herself
on
his
*NL*
knee
,
as
if
the
proposition
opened
a
pleasing
novelty
.
Seeing
that
he
*NL*
must
proceed
to
extremities
,
he
put
her
into
the
coal-hole
,
and
held
*NL*
the
door
closed
,
with
a
trembling
sense
that
he
was
using
a
strong
*NL*
measure
.
For
a
moment
there
was
silence
,
but
then
came
a
little
cry
,
*NL*
``
Opy
,
opy
!
''
and
Silas
let
her
out
again
,
saying
,
``
Now
Eppie
`
ull
never
*NL*
be
naughty
again
,
else
she
must
go
in
the
coal-hole
--
a
black
naughty
*NL*
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
weaving
must
stand
still
a
long
while
this
morning
,
for
now
Eppie
*NL*
must
be
washed
,
and
have
clean
clothes
on
;
but
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
*NL*
this
punishment
would
have
a
lasting
effect
,
and
save
time
in
*NL*
future
--
though
,
perhaps
,
it
would
have
been
better
if
Eppie
had
cried
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
half
an
hour
she
was
clean
again
,
and
Silas
having
turned
his
back
*NL*
to
see
what
he
could
do
with
the
linen
band
,
threw
it
down
again
,
with
*NL*
the
reflection
that
Eppie
would
be
good
without
fastening
for
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
morning
.
He
turned
round
again
,
and
was
going
to
place
her
in
*NL*
her
little
chair
near
the
loom
,
when
she
peeped
out
at
him
with
black
*NL*
face
and
hands
again
,
and
said
,
``
Eppie
in
de
toal-hole
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
total
failure
of
the
coal-hole
discipline
shook
Silas
's
belief
in
*NL*
the
efficacy
of
punishment
.
``
She
'd
take
it
all
for
fun
,
''
he
observed
*NL*
to
Dolly
,
``
if
I
did
n't
hurt
her
,
and
that
I
ca
n't
do
,
Mrs.
Winthrop
.
*NL*
If
she
makes
me
a
bit
o
'
trouble
,
I
can
bear
it
.
And
she
's
got
no
*NL*
tricks
but
what
she
'll
grow
out
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
partly
true
,
Master
Marner
,
''
said
Dolly
,
sympathetically
;
*NL*
``
and
if
you
ca
n't
bring
your
mind
to
frighten
her
off
touching
things
,
*NL*
you
must
do
what
you
can
to
keep
'em
out
of
her
way
.
That
's
what
I
do
*NL*
wi
'
the
pups
as
the
lads
are
allays
a-rearing
.
They
_
will
_
worry
and
*NL*
gnaw
--
worry
and
gnaw
they
will
,
if
it
was
one
's
Sunday
cap
as
hung
*NL*
anywhere
so
as
they
could
drag
it
.
They
know
no
difference
,
God
help
*NL*
'em
:
it
's
the
pushing
o
'
the
teeth
as
sets
'em
on
,
that
's
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Eppie
was
reared
without
punishment
,
the
burden
of
her
misdeeds
*NL*
being
borne
vicariously
by
father
Silas
.
The
stone
hut
was
made
a
soft
*NL*
nest
for
her
,
lined
with
downy
patience
:
and
also
in
the
world
that
lay
*NL*
beyond
the
stone
hut
she
knew
nothing
of
frowns
and
denials
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
difficulty
of
carrying
her
and
his
yarn
or
linen
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
Silas
took
her
with
him
in
most
of
his
journeys
to
the
*NL*
farmhouses
,
unwilling
to
leave
her
behind
at
Dolly
Winthrop
's
,
who
was
*NL*
always
ready
to
take
care
of
her
;
and
little
curly-headed
Eppie
,
the
*NL*
weaver
's
child
,
became
an
object
of
interest
at
several
outlying
*NL*
homesteads
,
as
well
as
in
the
village
.
Hitherto
he
had
been
treated
*NL*
very
much
as
if
he
had
been
a
useful
gnome
or
brownie
--
a
queer
and
*NL*
unaccountable
creature
,
who
must
necessarily
be
looked
at
with
*NL*
wondering
curiosity
and
repulsion
,
and
with
whom
one
would
be
glad
to
*NL*
make
all
greetings
and
bargains
as
brief
as
possible
,
but
who
must
be
*NL*
dealt
with
in
a
propitiatory
way
,
and
occasionally
have
a
present
of
*NL*
pork
or
garden
stuff
to
carry
home
with
him
,
seeing
that
without
him
*NL*
there
was
no
getting
the
yarn
woven
.
But
now
Silas
met
with
open
*NL*
smiling
faces
and
cheerful
questioning
,
as
a
person
whose
satisfactions
*NL*
and
difficulties
could
be
understood
.
Everywhere
he
must
sit
a
little
*NL*
and
talk
about
the
child
,
and
words
of
interest
were
always
ready
for
*NL*
him
:
``
Ah
,
Master
Marner
,
you
'll
be
lucky
if
she
takes
the
measles
soon
*NL*
and
easy
!
''
--
or
,
``
Why
,
there
is
n't
many
lone
men
`
ud
ha
'
been
wishing
to
*NL*
take
up
with
a
little
un
like
that
:
but
I
reckon
the
weaving
makes
you
*NL*
handier
than
men
as
do
out-door
work
--
you
're
partly
as
handy
as
a
*NL*
woman
,
for
weaving
comes
next
to
spinning
.
''
Elderly
masters
and
*NL*
mistresses
,
seated
observantly
in
large
kitchen
arm-chairs
,
shook
their
*NL*
heads
over
the
difficulties
attendant
on
rearing
children
,
felt
Eppie
's
*NL*
round
arms
and
legs
,
and
pronounced
them
remarkably
firm
,
and
told
*NL*
Silas
that
,
if
she
turned
out
well
-LRB-
which
,
however
,
there
was
no
*NL*
telling
-RRB-
,
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
him
to
have
a
steady
lass
to
do
*NL*
for
him
when
he
got
helpless
.
Servant
maidens
were
fond
of
carrying
*NL*
her
out
to
look
at
the
hens
and
chickens
,
or
to
see
if
any
cherries
*NL*
could
be
shaken
down
in
the
orchard
;
and
the
small
boys
and
girls
*NL*
approached
her
slowly
,
with
cautious
movement
and
steady
gaze
,
like
*NL*
little
dogs
face
to
face
with
one
of
their
own
kind
,
till
attraction
*NL*
had
reached
the
point
at
which
the
soft
lips
were
put
out
for
a
kiss
.
*NL*
No
child
was
afraid
of
approaching
Silas
when
Eppie
was
near
him
:
there
*NL*
was
no
repulsion
around
him
now
,
either
for
young
or
old
;
for
the
*NL*
little
child
had
come
to
link
him
once
more
with
the
whole
world
.
*NL*
There
was
love
between
him
and
the
child
that
blent
them
into
one
,
and
*NL*
there
was
love
between
the
child
and
the
world
--
from
men
and
women
with
*NL*
parental
looks
and
tones
,
to
the
red
lady-birds
and
the
round
pebbles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
began
now
to
think
of
Raveloe
life
entirely
in
relation
to
Eppie
:
*NL*
she
must
have
everything
that
was
a
good
in
Raveloe
;
and
he
listened
*NL*
docilely
,
that
he
might
come
to
understand
better
what
this
life
was
,
*NL*
from
which
,
for
fifteen
years
,
he
had
stood
aloof
as
from
a
strange
*NL*
thing
,
with
which
he
could
have
no
communion
:
as
some
man
who
has
a
*NL*
precious
plant
to
which
he
would
give
a
nurturing
home
in
a
new
soil
,
*NL*
thinks
of
the
rain
,
and
the
sunshine
,
and
all
influences
,
in
relation
*NL*
to
his
nursling
,
and
asks
industriously
for
all
knowledge
that
will
*NL*
help
him
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
the
searching
roots
,
or
to
guard
leaf
*NL*
and
bud
from
invading
harm
.
The
disposition
to
hoard
had
been
utterly
*NL*
crushed
at
the
very
first
by
the
loss
of
his
long-stored
gold
:
the
*NL*
coins
he
earned
afterwards
seemed
as
irrelevant
as
stones
brought
to
*NL*
complete
a
house
suddenly
buried
by
an
earthquake
;
the
sense
of
*NL*
bereavement
was
too
heavy
upon
him
for
the
old
thrill
of
satisfaction
*NL*
to
arise
again
at
the
touch
of
the
newly-earned
coin
.
And
now
*NL*
something
had
come
to
replace
his
hoard
which
gave
a
growing
purpose
to
*NL*
the
earnings
,
drawing
his
hope
and
joy
continually
onward
beyond
the
*NL*
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
old
days
there
were
angels
who
came
and
took
men
by
the
hand
and
led
*NL*
them
away
from
the
city
of
destruction
.
We
see
no
white-winged
angels
*NL*
now
.
But
yet
men
are
led
away
from
threatening
destruction
:
a
hand
is
*NL*
put
into
theirs
,
which
leads
them
forth
gently
towards
a
calm
and
*NL*
bright
land
,
so
that
they
look
no
more
backward
;
and
the
hand
may
be
a
*NL*
little
child
's
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
person
,
as
you
will
believe
,
who
watched
with
keener
*NL*
though
more
hidden
interest
than
any
other
,
the
prosperous
growth
of
*NL*
Eppie
under
the
weaver
's
care
.
He
dared
not
do
anything
that
would
*NL*
imply
a
stronger
interest
in
a
poor
man
's
adopted
child
than
could
be
*NL*
expected
from
the
kindliness
of
the
young
Squire
,
when
a
chance
meeting
*NL*
suggested
a
little
present
to
a
simple
old
fellow
whom
others
noticed
*NL*
with
goodwill
;
but
he
told
himself
that
the
time
would
come
when
he
*NL*
might
do
something
towards
furthering
the
welfare
of
his
daughter
*NL*
without
incurring
suspicion
.
Was
he
very
uneasy
in
the
meantime
at
his
*NL*
inability
to
give
his
daughter
her
birthright
?
I
can
not
say
that
he
*NL*
was
.
The
child
was
being
taken
care
of
,
and
would
very
likely
be
*NL*
happy
,
as
people
in
humble
stations
often
were
--
happier
,
perhaps
,
than
*NL*
those
brought
up
in
luxury
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
famous
ring
that
pricked
its
owner
when
he
forgot
duty
and
*NL*
followed
desire
--
I
wonder
if
it
pricked
very
hard
when
he
set
out
on
*NL*
the
chase
,
or
whether
it
pricked
but
lightly
then
,
and
only
pierced
to
*NL*
the
quick
when
the
chase
had
long
been
ended
,
and
hope
,
folding
her
*NL*
wings
,
looked
backward
and
became
regret
?
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
Cass
's
cheek
and
eye
were
brighter
than
ever
now
.
He
was
so
*NL*
undivided
in
his
aims
,
that
he
seemed
like
a
man
of
firmness
.
No
*NL*
Dunsey
had
come
back
:
people
had
made
up
their
minds
that
he
was
gone
*NL*
for
a
soldier
,
or
gone
``
out
of
the
country
''
,
and
no
one
cared
to
be
*NL*
specific
in
their
inquiries
on
a
subject
delicate
to
a
respectable
*NL*
family
.
Godfrey
had
ceased
to
see
the
shadow
of
Dunsey
across
his
*NL*
path
;
and
the
path
now
lay
straight
forward
to
the
accomplishment
of
*NL*
his
best
,
longest-cherished
wishes
.
Everybody
said
Mr.
Godfrey
had
*NL*
taken
the
right
turn
;
and
it
was
pretty
clear
what
would
be
the
end
of
*NL*
things
,
for
there
were
not
many
days
in
the
week
that
he
was
not
seen
*NL*
riding
to
the
Warrens
.
Godfrey
himself
,
when
he
was
asked
jocosely
if
*NL*
the
day
had
been
fixed
,
smiled
with
the
pleasant
consciousness
of
a
*NL*
lover
who
could
say
``
yes
''
,
if
he
liked
.
He
felt
a
reformed
man
,
*NL*
delivered
from
temptation
;
and
the
vision
of
his
future
life
seemed
to
*NL*
him
as
a
promised
land
for
which
he
had
no
cause
to
fight
.
He
saw
*NL*
himself
with
all
his
happiness
centred
on
his
own
hearth
,
while
Nancy
*NL*
would
smile
on
him
as
he
played
with
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
other
child
--
not
on
the
hearth
--
he
would
not
forget
it
;
he
*NL*
would
see
that
it
was
well
provided
for
.
That
was
a
father
's
duty
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
bright
autumn
Sunday
,
sixteen
years
after
Silas
Marner
had
*NL*
found
his
new
treasure
on
the
hearth
.
The
bells
of
the
old
Raveloe
*NL*
church
were
ringing
the
cheerful
peal
which
told
that
the
morning
*NL*
service
was
ended
;
and
out
of
the
arched
doorway
in
the
tower
came
*NL*
slowly
,
retarded
by
friendly
greetings
and
questions
,
the
richer
*NL*
parishioners
who
had
chosen
this
bright
Sunday
morning
as
eligible
for
*NL*
church-going
.
It
was
the
rural
fashion
of
that
time
for
the
more
*NL*
important
members
of
the
congregation
to
depart
first
,
while
their
*NL*
humbler
neighbours
waited
and
looked
on
,
stroking
their
bent
heads
or
*NL*
dropping
their
curtsies
to
any
large
ratepayer
who
turned
to
notice
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Foremost
among
these
advancing
groups
of
well-clad
people
,
there
are
*NL*
some
whom
we
shall
recognize
,
in
spite
of
Time
,
who
has
laid
his
hand
*NL*
on
them
all
.
The
tall
blond
man
of
forty
is
not
much
changed
in
*NL*
feature
from
the
Godfrey
Cass
of
six-and-twenty
:
he
is
only
fuller
in
*NL*
flesh
,
and
has
only
lost
the
indefinable
look
of
youth
--
a
loss
which
is
*NL*
marked
even
when
the
eye
is
undulled
and
the
wrinkles
are
not
yet
come
.
*NL*
Perhaps
the
pretty
woman
,
not
much
younger
than
he
,
who
is
leaning
on
*NL*
his
arm
,
is
more
changed
than
her
husband
:
the
lovely
bloom
that
used
*NL*
to
be
always
on
her
cheek
now
comes
but
fitfully
,
with
the
fresh
*NL*
morning
air
or
with
some
strong
surprise
;
yet
to
all
who
love
human
*NL*
faces
best
for
what
they
tell
of
human
experience
,
Nancy
's
beauty
has
a
*NL*
heightened
interest
.
Often
the
soul
is
ripened
into
fuller
goodness
*NL*
while
age
has
spread
an
ugly
film
,
so
that
mere
glances
can
never
*NL*
divine
the
preciousness
of
the
fruit
.
But
the
years
have
not
been
so
*NL*
cruel
to
Nancy
.
The
firm
yet
placid
mouth
,
the
clear
veracious
glance
*NL*
of
the
brown
eyes
,
speak
now
of
a
nature
that
has
been
tested
and
has
*NL*
kept
its
highest
qualities
;
and
even
the
costume
,
with
its
dainty
*NL*
neatness
and
purity
,
has
more
significance
now
the
coquetries
of
youth
*NL*
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Godfrey
Cass
-LRB-
any
higher
title
has
died
away
from
Raveloe
*NL*
lips
since
the
old
Squire
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
and
his
*NL*
inheritance
was
divided
-RRB-
have
turned
round
to
look
for
the
tall
aged
*NL*
man
and
the
plainly
dressed
woman
who
are
a
little
behind
--
Nancy
having
*NL*
observed
that
they
must
wait
for
``
father
and
Priscilla
''
--
and
now
they
*NL*
all
turn
into
a
narrower
path
leading
across
the
churchyard
to
a
small
*NL*
gate
opposite
the
Red
House
.
We
will
not
follow
them
now
;
for
may
*NL*
there
not
be
some
others
in
this
departing
congregation
whom
we
should
*NL*
like
to
see
again
--
some
of
those
who
are
not
likely
to
be
handsomely
*NL*
clad
,
and
whom
we
may
not
recognize
so
easily
as
the
master
and
*NL*
mistress
of
the
Red
House
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
impossible
to
mistake
Silas
Marner
.
His
large
brown
eyes
*NL*
seem
to
have
gathered
a
longer
vision
,
as
is
the
way
with
eyes
that
*NL*
have
been
short-sighted
in
early
life
,
and
they
have
a
less
vague
,
a
*NL*
more
answering
gaze
;
but
in
everything
else
one
sees
signs
of
a
frame
*NL*
much
enfeebled
by
the
lapse
of
the
sixteen
years
.
The
weaver
's
bent
*NL*
shoulders
and
white
hair
give
him
almost
the
look
of
advanced
age
,
*NL*
though
he
is
not
more
than
five-and-fifty
;
but
there
is
the
freshest
*NL*
blossom
of
youth
close
by
his
side
--
a
blonde
dimpled
girl
of
eighteen
,
*NL*
who
has
vainly
tried
to
chastise
her
curly
auburn
hair
into
smoothness
*NL*
under
her
brown
bonnet
:
the
hair
ripples
as
obstinately
as
a
brooklet
*NL*
under
the
March
breeze
,
and
the
little
ringlets
burst
away
from
the
*NL*
restraining
comb
behind
and
show
themselves
below
the
bonnet-crown
.
*NL*
Eppie
can
not
help
being
rather
vexed
about
her
hair
,
for
there
is
no
*NL*
other
girl
in
Raveloe
who
has
hair
at
all
like
it
,
and
she
thinks
hair
*NL*
ought
to
be
smooth
.
She
does
not
like
to
be
blameworthy
even
in
small
*NL*
things
:
you
see
how
neatly
her
prayer-book
is
folded
in
her
spotted
*NL*
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
good-looking
young
fellow
,
in
a
new
fustian
suit
,
who
walks
behind
*NL*
her
,
is
not
quite
sure
upon
the
question
of
hair
in
the
abstract
,
when
*NL*
Eppie
puts
it
to
him
,
and
thinks
that
perhaps
straight
hair
is
the
best
*NL*
in
general
,
but
he
does
n't
want
Eppie
's
hair
to
be
different
.
She
*NL*
surely
divines
that
there
is
some
one
behind
her
who
is
thinking
about
*NL*
her
very
particularly
,
and
mustering
courage
to
come
to
her
side
as
*NL*
soon
as
they
are
out
in
the
lane
,
else
why
should
she
look
rather
shy
,
*NL*
and
take
care
not
to
turn
away
her
head
from
her
father
Silas
,
to
whom
*NL*
she
keeps
murmuring
little
sentences
as
to
who
was
at
church
and
who
*NL*
was
not
at
church
,
and
how
pretty
the
red
mountain-ash
is
over
the
*NL*
Rectory
wall
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
_
we
_
had
a
little
garden
,
father
,
with
double
daisies
in
,
like
*NL*
Mrs.
Winthrop
's
,
''
said
Eppie
,
when
they
were
out
in
the
lane
;
``
only
*NL*
they
say
it
`
ud
take
a
deal
of
digging
and
bringing
fresh
soil
--
and
you
*NL*
could
n't
do
that
,
could
you
,
father
?
Anyhow
,
I
should
n't
like
you
to
*NL*
do
it
,
for
it
`
ud
be
too
hard
work
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
could
do
it
,
child
,
if
you
want
a
bit
o
'
garden
:
these
long
*NL*
evenings
,
I
could
work
at
taking
in
a
little
bit
o
'
the
waste
,
just
*NL*
enough
for
a
root
or
two
o
'
flowers
for
you
;
and
again
,
i
'
the
morning
,
*NL*
I
could
have
a
turn
wi
'
the
spade
before
I
sat
down
to
the
loom
.
Why
*NL*
did
n't
you
tell
me
before
as
you
wanted
a
bit
o
'
garden
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
can
dig
it
for
you
,
Master
Marner
,
''
said
the
young
man
in
fustian
,
*NL*
who
was
now
by
Eppie
's
side
,
entering
into
the
conversation
without
the
*NL*
trouble
of
formalities
.
``
It
'll
be
play
to
me
after
I
've
done
my
day
's
*NL*
work
,
or
any
odd
bits
o
'
time
when
the
work
's
slack
.
And
I
'll
bring
*NL*
you
some
soil
from
Mr.
Cass
's
garden
--
he
'll
let
me
,
and
willing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
Aaron
,
my
lad
,
are
you
there
?
''
said
Silas
;
``
I
was
n't
aware
of
*NL*
you
;
for
when
Eppie
's
talking
o

things
,
I
see
nothing
but
what
she
's
*NL*
a-saying
.
Well
,
if
you
could
help
me
with
the
digging
,
we
might
get
*NL*
her
a
bit
o

garden
all
the
sooner

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
if
you
think
well

good

said
Aaron
,
``
I
'll
come
to
the
*NL*
Stone-pits
this
afternoon

we
'll
settle
what
land
's
to

taken
in
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
get
up
an
hour
earlier
i

the
morning
,

begin
on
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not

you
do
n't
promise
me
not
to
work
at
the
hard
digging

said
Eppie
.
``
For
I
should
n't
ha

said
anything
about
it

she
*NL*
added
,
half-bashfully
,
half-roguishly
,
``
only
Mrs.
Winthrop
said
as

Aaron

be
so
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
might

said
Aaron
.
*NL*
``

Marner
knows

able

willing

do
a

turn
o

work
for

Eppie
,
``
and
you

me
can
mark
out
the
beds

make
holes

plant

the
roots

It
'll
be
a
deal
livelier
at
the
Stone-pits
when
we
've
got
*NL*
some
flowers
,
for
I
always
think
the
flowers
can
see
us
and
know
what
*NL*
we
're
talking
about
.
And
I
'll
have
a
bit
o

rosemary
,
and
bergamot
,
*NL*
and
thyme
,
because
they
're
so
sweet-smelling
;

there
's
no
lavender
*NL*
only
in
the
gentlefolks

gardens
,
I
think
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
no
reason
why
you
should
n't
have
some

said
Aaron
,
``
for
I
can
*NL*
bring
you
slips

I
'm
forced
to
cut
no
end

I

*NL*
gardening

throw
'em
away
mostly

There
's
a
big
bed

lavender
at

the
Red
House

the

is
very
fond
of

*NL*
*NL*
``

Silas

gravely

good
to

up

No

Aaron

there

*NL*
somebody

what
I

there

there
was
never

way
to

one
thinking

go
back

*NL*
Aaron
turned
back
up
the
village

went
on
up
the

lonely
sheltered
lane

*NL*
*NL*
``
O

she
began
,
when
they
were
in
privacy

clasping
and

squeezing
Silas

skipping
round
to
give
him
an
energetic

kiss

so
glad

dig
it
for

went
on
with
roguish
triumph

well

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Silas
,
with
the
mild
passive
*NL*
happiness
of
love-crowned
age
in
his
face
;

''
*NL*
*NL*
Eppie
was
now
aware
that
her
behaviour
was
under
observation
,
but
it
*NL*
was
only
the
observation
of
a
friendly
donkey
,
browsing
with
a
log
*NL*
fastened
to
his
foot
--
a
meek
donkey
,
not
scornfully
critical
of
human
*NL*
trivialities
,
but
thankful
to
share
in
them
,
if
possible
,
by
getting
*NL*
his
nose
scratched
;
and
Eppie
did
not
fail
to
gratify
him
with
her
*NL*
usual
notice
,
though
it
was
attended
with
the
inconvenience
of
his
*NL*
following
them
,
painfully
,
up
to
the
very
door
of
their
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
sound
of
a
sharp
bark
inside
,
as
Eppie
put
the
key
in
the
door
,
*NL*
modified
the
donkey
's
views
,
and
he
limped
away
again
without
bidding
.
*NL*
The
sharp
bark
was
the
sign
of
an
excited
welcome
that
was
awaiting
*NL*
them
from
a
knowing
brown
terrier
,
who
,
after
dancing
at
their
legs
in
*NL*
a
hysterical
manner
,
rushed
with
a
worrying
noise
at
a
tortoise-shell
*NL*
kitten
under
the
loom
,
and
then
rushed
back
with
a
sharp
bark
again
,
as
*NL*
much
as
to
say
,
``
I
have
done
my
duty
by
this
feeble
creature
,
you
*NL*
perceive
''
;
while
the
lady-mother
of
the
kitten
sat
sunning
her
white
*NL*
bosom
in
the
window
,
and
looked
round
with
a
sleepy
air
of
expecting
*NL*
caresses
,
though
she
was
not
going
to
take
any
trouble
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
presence
of
this
happy
animal
life
was
not
the
only
change
which
*NL*
had
come
over
the
interior
of
the
stone
cottage
.
There
was
no
bed
now
*NL*
in
the
living-room
,
and
the
small
space
was
well
filled
with
decent
*NL*
furniture
,
all
bright
and
clean
enough
to
satisfy
Dolly
Winthrop
's
eye
.
*NL*
The
oaken
table
and
three-cornered
oaken
chair
were
hardly
what
was
*NL*
likely
to
be
seen
in
so
poor
a
cottage
:
they
had
come
,
with
the
beds
*NL*
and
other
things
,
from
the
Red
House
;
for
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
,
as
every
*NL*
one
said
in
the
village
,
did
very
kindly
by
the
weaver
;
and
it
was
*NL*
nothing
but
right
a
man
should
be
looked
on
and
helped
by
those
who
*NL*
could
afford
it
,
when
he
had
brought
up
an
orphan
child
,
and
been
*NL*
father
and
mother
to
her
--
and
had
lost
his
money
too
,
so
as
he
had
*NL*
nothing
but
what
he
worked
for
week
by
week
,
and
when
the
weaving
was
*NL*
going
down
too
--
for
there
was
less
and
less
flax
spun
--
and
Master
*NL*
Marner
was
none
so
young
.
Nobody
was
jealous
of
the
weaver
,
for
he
was
*NL*
regarded
as
an
exceptional
person
,
whose
claims
on
neighbourly
help
*NL*
were
not
to
be
matched
in
Raveloe
.
Any
superstition
that
remained
*NL*
concerning
him
had
taken
an
entirely
new
colour
;
and
Mr.
Macey
,
now
a
*NL*
very
feeble
old
man
of
fourscore
and
six
,
never
seen
except
in
his
*NL*
chimney-corner
or
sitting
in
the
sunshine
at
his
door-sill
,
was
of
*NL*
opinion
that
when
a
man
had
done
what
Silas
had
done
by
an
orphan
*NL*
child
,
it
was
a
sign
that
his
money
would
come
to
light
again
,
or
*NL*
leastwise
that
the
robber
would
be
made
to
answer
for
it
--
for
,
as
Mr.
*NL*
Macey
observed
of
himself
,
his
faculties
were
as
strong
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
sat
down
now
and
watched
Eppie
with
a
satisfied
gaze
as
she
*NL*
spread
the
clean
cloth
,
and
set
on
it
the
potato-pie
,
warmed
up
slowly
*NL*
in
a
safe
Sunday
fashion
,
by
being
put
into
a
dry
pot
over
a
*NL*
slowly-dying
fire
,
as
the
best
substitute
for
an
oven
.
For
Silas
would
*NL*
not
consent
to
have
a
grate
and
oven
added
to
his
conveniences
:
he
*NL*
loved
the
old
brick
hearth
as
he
had
loved
his
brown
pot
--
and
was
it
*NL*
not
there
when
he
had
found
Eppie
?
The
gods
of
the
hearth
exist
for
us
*NL*
still
;
and
let
all
new
faith
be
tolerant
of
that
fetishism
,
lest
it
*NL*
bruise
its
own
roots
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
ate
his
dinner
more
silently
than
usual
,
soon
laying
down
his
*NL*
knife
and
fork
,
and
watching
half-abstractedly
Eppie
's
play
with
Snap
*NL*
and
the
cat
,
by
which
her
own
dining
was
made
rather
a
lengthy
*NL*
business
.
Yet
it
was
a
sight
that
might
well
arrest
wandering
*NL*
thoughts
:
Eppie
,
with
the
rippling
radiance
of
her
hair
and
the
*NL*
whiteness
of
her
rounded
chin
and
throat
set
off
by
the
dark-blue
*NL*
cotton
gown
,
laughing
merrily
as
the
kitten
held
on
with
her
four
claws
*NL*
to
one
shoulder
,
like
a
design
for
a
jug-handle
,
while
Snap
on
the
*NL*
right
hand
and
Puss
on
the
other
put
up
their
paws
towards
a
morsel
*NL*
which
she
held
out
of
the
reach
of
both
--
Snap
occasionally
desisting
in
*NL*
order
to
remonstrate
with
the
cat
by
a
cogent
worrying
growl
on
the
*NL*
greediness
and
futility
of
her
conduct
;
till
Eppie
relented
,
caressed
*NL*
them
both
,
and
divided
the
morsel
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
last
Eppie
,
glancing
at
the
clock
,
checked
the
play
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
O
daddy
,
you
're
wanting
to
go
into
the
sunshine
to
smoke
your
pipe
.
*NL*
But
I
must
clear
away
first
,
so
as
the
house
may
be
tidy
when
godmother
*NL*
comes
.
I
'll
make
haste
--
I
wo
n't
be
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
had
taken
to
smoking
a
pipe
daily
during
the
last
two
years
,
*NL*
having
been
strongly
urged
to
it
by
the
sages
of
Raveloe
,
as
a
practice
*NL*
``
good
for
the
fits
''
;
and
this
advice
was
sanctioned
by
Dr.
Kimble
,
on
*NL*
the
ground
that
it
was
as
well
to
try
what
could
do
no
harm
--
a
*NL*
principle
which
was
made
to
answer
for
a
great
deal
of
work
in
that
*NL*
gentleman
's
medical
practice
.
Silas
did
not
highly
enjoy
smoking
,
and
*NL*
often
wondered
how
his
neighbours
could
be
so
fond
of
it
;
but
a
humble
*NL*
sort
of
acquiescence
in
what
was
held
to
be
good
,
had
become
a
strong
*NL*
habit
of
that
new
self
which
had
been
developed
in
him
since
he
had
*NL*
found
Eppie
on
his
hearth
:
it
had
been
the
only
clew
his
bewildered
*NL*
mind
could
hold
by
in
cherishing
this
young
life
that
had
been
sent
to
*NL*
him
out
of
the
darkness
into
which
his
gold
had
departed
.
By
seeking
*NL*
what
was
needful
for
Eppie
,
by
sharing
the
effect
that
everything
*NL*
produced
on
her
,
he
had
himself
come
to
appropriate
the
forms
of
custom
*NL*
and
belief
which
were
the
mould
of
Raveloe
life
;
and
as
,
with
*NL*
reawakening
sensibilities
,
memory
also
reawakened
,
he
had
begun
to
*NL*
ponder
over
the
elements
of
his
old
faith
,
and
blend
them
with
his
new
*NL*
impressions
,
till
he
recovered
a
consciousness
of
unity
between
his
*NL*
past
and
present
.
The
sense
of
presiding
goodness
and
the
human
trust
*NL*
which
come
with
all
pure
peace
and
joy
,
had
given
him
a
dim
impression
*NL*
that
there
had
been
some
error
,
some
mistake
,
which
had
thrown
that
*NL*
dark
shadow
over
the
days
of
his
best
years
;
and
as
it
grew
more
and
*NL*
more
easy
to
him
to
open
his
mind
to
Dolly
Winthrop
,
he
gradually
*NL*
communicated
to
her
all
he
could
describe
of
his
early
life
.
The
*NL*
communication
was
necessarily
a
slow
and
difficult
process
,
for
Silas
's
*NL*
meagre
power
of
explanation
was
not
aided
by
any
readiness
of
*NL*
interpretation
in
Dolly
,
whose
narrow
outward
experience
gave
her
no
*NL*
key
to
strange
customs
,
and
made
every
novelty
a
source
of
wonder
that
*NL*
arrested
them
at
every
step
of
the
narrative
.
It
was
only
by
*NL*
fragments
,
and
at
intervals
which
left
Dolly
time
to
revolve
what
she
*NL*
had
heard
till
it
acquired
some
familiarity
for
her
,
that
Silas
at
last
*NL*
arrived
at
the
climax
of
the
sad
story
--
the
drawing
of
lots
,
and
its
*NL*
false
testimony
concerning
him
;
and
this
had
to
be
repeated
in
several
*NL*
interviews
,
under
new
questions
on
her
part
as
to
the
nature
of
this
*NL*
plan
for
detecting
the
guilty
and
clearing
the
innocent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yourn
's
the
same
Bible
,
you
're
sure
o
'
that
,
Master
Marner
--
the
*NL*
Bible
as
you
brought
wi
'
you
from
that
country
--
it
's
the
same
as
what
*NL*
they
've
got
at
church
,
and
what
Eppie
's
a-learning
to
read
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Silas
,
``
every
bit
the
same
;
and
there
's
drawing
o
'
lots
in
*NL*
the
Bible

''
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
dear
,
''
said
Dolly
in
a
grieved
voice
,
as
if
she
were
hearing
*NL*
an
unfavourable
report
of
a
sick
man
's
case
.
She
was
silent
for
some
*NL*
minutes
;
at
last
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
wise
folks
,
happen
,
as
know
how
it
all
is
;
the
parson
knows
,
*NL*
I
'll
be
bound
;
but
it
takes
big
words
to
tell
them
things
,
and
such
as
*NL*
poor
folks
ca
n't
make
much
out
on
.
I
can
never
rightly
know
the
*NL*
meaning
o

what
I
hear
at
church
,
only
a
bit
here

there

I
know

good
words

I
do

But
what
lies
upo

it
's
this

Master
*NL*
Marner
:
as
,
if
Them
above
had
done
the
right
thing
by
you
,
They
'd
never
*NL*
ha

let
you
be
turned
out
for
a
wicked
thief
when
you
was
innicent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Silas
,
who
had
now
come
to
understand
Dolly
's
phraseology
,
*NL*
``
that
was
what
fell
on
me
like
as
if
it
had
been
red-hot
iron
;
because

you
see
,
there
was
nobody
as
cared
for

clave
to
me
above

*NL*
below

And
him
as
I
'd
gone
out

in

for
ten
year
and
more
,
since
*NL*
when
we
was
lads
and
went
halves
--
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
I
*NL*
trusted
,
had
lifted
up
his
heel
again
'
me
,
and
worked
to
ruin
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
but
he
was
a
bad
un
--
I
ca
n't
think
as
there
's
another
such

said
*NL*
Dolly
.
``
But
I
'm
o'ercome

did

I

I
do
when
I

laid
something
up

I
ca

justly
put

there
was

no

you
did

we
'll

talk
on

again

sometimes
things
come
into
my

leeching

poulticing

such

never

still

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
was
too
useful
a
woman
not
to
have
many
opportunities
of
*NL*
illumination
of
the
kind
she
alluded
to
,
and
she
was
not
long
before
*NL*
she
recurred
to
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Marner

she
said
,
one
day
that
she
came
to
bring
home
Eppie

*NL*
washing
,
``

've
been
sore
puzzled

twisted

it
come

good
words

down

``

Silas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
Master
Marner

it
come
to
me
summat
like
this
:
I
can
make

nothing
o

the
drawing
o

the
answer
coming
wrong

it
`

mayhap
take
the

to
tell

he
could
only
tell

But
what
come
to
me
as
clear
as
the
daylight

it
was
when
I
was
*NL*
troubling
over
poor
Bessy
Fawkes

it
allays
comes
into
my
head
when
*NL*
I
'm
sorry
for
folks
,
and
feel
as
I
ca
n't
do
a
power
to
help
'em

not
if
*NL*
I
was
to
get
up
i

the
middle
o

it
comes
into
my
head

be

better

if
anything
looks
hard

it

because

things

that

so

while
I
was
thinking

that
,
you
come
into

my

Master

it
all
come
pouring
in
:

if

I

felt
i

my

inside
what
was
the
right

just
thing
by

there
Them
as
was
at

making
on

that
's
all

I
*NL*
can
be
sure
on
,
and
everything
else
is
a
big
puzzle
to
me
when
I
think
*NL*
on
it
.
For
there
was
the
fever
come
and
took
off
them
as
were
*NL*
full-growed
,
and
left
the
helpless
children
;
and
there
's
the
breaking
*NL*
o
'
limbs
;
and
them
as
`
ud
do
right
and
be
sober
have
to
suffer
by
them
*NL*
as
are
contrairy
--
eh
,
there
's
trouble
i
'
this
world
,
and
there
's
things
*NL*
as
we
can
niver
make
out
the
rights
on
.
And
all
as
we
've
got
to
do
is
*NL*
to
trusten
,
Master
Marner
--
to
do
the
right
thing
as
fur
as
we
know
,
and
*NL*
to
trusten
.
For
if
us
as
knows
so
little
can
see
a
bit
o
'
good
and
*NL*
rights
,
we
may
be
sure
as
there
's
a
good
and
a
rights
bigger
nor
what
*NL*
we
can
know
--
I
feel
it
i
'
my
own
inside
as
it
must
be
so
.
And
if
you
*NL*
could
but
ha
'
gone
on
trustening
,
Master
Marner
,
you
would
n't
ha
'
run
*NL*
away
from
your
fellow-creaturs
and
been
so
lone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
that
`
ud
ha
'
been
hard
,
''
said
Silas
,
in
an
under-tone
;
``
it
`
ud
*NL*
ha
'
been
hard
to
trusten
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
it
would
,
''
said
Dolly
,
almost
with
compunction
;
``
them
things
*NL*
are
easier
said
nor
done
;
and
I
'm
partly
ashamed
o
'
talking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
said
Silas
,
``
you
're
i
'
the
right
,
Mrs.
Winthrop
--
you
're
i
'
*NL*
the
right
.
There
's
good
i
'
this
world
--
I
've
a
feeling
o
'
that
now
;
and
*NL*
it
makes
a
man
feel
as
there
's
a
good
more
nor
he
can
see
,
i
'
spite
o
'
*NL*
the
trouble
and
the
wickedness
.
That
drawing
o
'
the
lots
is
dark
;
but
*NL*
the
child
was
sent
to
me
:
there
's
dealings
with
us
--
there
's
dealings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
dialogue
took
place
in
Eppie
's
earlier
years
,
when
Silas
had
to
*NL*
part
with
her
for
two
hours
every
day
,
that
she
might
learn
to
read
at
*NL*
the
dame
school
,
after
he
had
vainly
tried
himself
to
guide
her
in
that
*NL*
first
step
to
learning
.
Now
that
she
was
grown
up
,
Silas
had
often
*NL*
been
led
,
in
those
moments
of
quiet
outpouring
which
come
to
people
who
*NL*
live
together
in
perfect
love
,
to
talk
with
_
her
_
too
of
the
past
,
and
*NL*
how
and
why
he
had
lived
a
lonely
man
until
she
had
been
sent
to
him
.
*NL*
For
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
hide
from
Eppie
that
she
*NL*
was
not
his
own
child
:
even
if
the
most
delicate
reticence
on
the
point
*NL*
could
have
been
expected
from
Raveloe
gossips
in
her
presence
,
her
own
*NL*
questions
about
her
mother
could
not
have
been
parried
,
as
she
grew
up
,
*NL*
without
that
complete
shrouding
of
the
past
which
would
have
made
a
*NL*
painful
barrier
between
their
minds
.
So
Eppie
had
long
known
how
her
*NL*
mother
had
died
on
the
snowy
ground
,
and
how
she
herself
had
been
found
*NL*
on
the
hearth
by
father
Silas
,
who
had
taken
her
golden
curls
for
his
*NL*
lost
guineas
brought
back
to
him
.
The
tender
and
peculiar
love
with
*NL*
which
Silas
had
reared
her
in
almost
inseparable
companionship
with
*NL*
himself
,
aided
by
the
seclusion
of
their
dwelling
,
had
preserved
her
*NL*
from
the
lowering
influences
of
the
village
talk
and
habits
,
and
had
*NL*
kept
her
mind
in
that
freshness
which
is
sometimes
falsely
supposed
to
*NL*
be
an
invariable
attribute
of
rusticity
.
Perfect
love
has
a
breath
of
*NL*
poetry
which
can
exalt
the
relations
of
the
least-instructed
human
*NL*
beings
;
and
this
breath
of
poetry
had
surrounded
Eppie
from
the
time
*NL*
when
she
had
followed
the
bright
gleam
that
beckoned
her
to
Silas
's
*NL*
hearth
;
so
that
it
is
not
surprising
if
,
in
other
things
besides
her
*NL*
delicate
prettiness
,
she
was
not
quite
a
common
village
maiden
,
but
had
*NL*
a
touch
of
refinement
and
fervour
which
came
from
no
other
teaching
*NL*
than
that
of
tenderly-nurtured
unvitiated
feeling
.
She
was
too
*NL*
childish
and
simple
for
her
imagination
to
rove
into
questions
about
*NL*
her
unknown
father
;
for
a
long
while
it
did
not
even
occur
to
her
that
*NL*
she
must
have
had
a
father
;
and
the
first
time
that
the
idea
of
her
*NL*
mother
having
had
a
husband
presented
itself
to
her
,
was
when
Silas
*NL*
showed
her
the
wedding-ring
which
had
been
taken
from
the
wasted
*NL*
finger
,
and
had
been
carefully
preserved
by
him
in
a
little
lackered
*NL*
box
shaped
like
a
shoe
.
He
delivered
this
box
into
Eppie
's
charge
when
*NL*
she
had
grown
up
,
and
she
often
opened
it
to
look
at
the
ring
:
but
*NL*
still
she
thought
hardly
at
all
about
the
father
of
whom
it
was
the
*NL*
symbol
.
Had
she
not
a
father
very
close
to
her
,
who
loved
her
better
*NL*
than
any
real
fathers
in
the
village
seemed
to
love
their
daughters
?
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
who
her
mother
was
,
and
how
she
came
to
die
in
that
*NL*
forlornness
,
were
questions
that
often
pressed
on
Eppie
's
mind
.
Her
*NL*
knowledge
of
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
who
was
her
nearest
friend
next
to
Silas
,
*NL*
made
her
feel
that
a
mother
must
be
very
precious
;
and
she
had
again
*NL*
and
again
asked
Silas
to
tell
her
how
her
mother
looked
,
whom
she
was
*NL*
like
,
and
how
he
had
found
her
against
the
furze
bush
,
led
towards
it
*NL*
by
the
little
footsteps
and
the
outstretched
arms
.
The
furze
bush
was
*NL*
there
still
;
and
this
afternoon
,
when
Eppie
came
out
with
Silas
into
*NL*
the
sunshine
,
it
was
the
first
object
that
arrested
her
eyes
and
*NL*
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
tone
of
gentle
gravity
,
which
sometimes
came
*NL*
like
a
sadder
,
slower
cadence
across
her
playfulness
,
``
we
shall
take
*NL*
the
furze
bush
into
the
garden
;
it
'll
come
into
the
corner
,
and
just
*NL*
against
it
I
'll
put
snowdrops
and
crocuses
,
'cause
Aaron
says
they
*NL*
wo
n't
die
out
,
but
'll
always
get
more
and
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
child
,
''
said
Silas
,
always
ready
to
talk
when
he
had
his
pipe
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
apparently
enjoying
the
pauses
more
than
the
puffs
,
``
it
*NL*
would
n't
do
to
leave
out
the
furze
bush
;
and
there
's
nothing
prettier
,
*NL*
to
my
thinking
,
when
it
's
yallow
with
flowers
.
But
it
's
just
come
into
*NL*
my
head
what
we
're
to
do
for
a
fence
--
mayhap
Aaron
can
help
us
to
a
*NL*
thought
;
but
a
fence
we
must
have
,
else
the
donkeys
and
things
`
ull
*NL*
come
and
trample
everything
down
.
And
fencing
's
hard
to
be
got
at
,
by
*NL*
what
I
can
make
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
daddy
,
''
said
Eppie
,
clasping
her
hands
suddenly
,
*NL*
after
a
minute
's
thought
.
``
There
's
lots
o
'
loose
stones
about
,
some
of
*NL*
'em
not
big
,
and
we
might
lay
'em
atop
of
one
another
,
and
make
a
wall
.
*NL*
You
and
me
could
carry
the
smallest
,
and
Aaron
`
ud
carry
the
rest
--
I
*NL*
know
he
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
my
precious
un
,
''
said
Silas
,
``
there
is
n't
enough
stones
to
go
all
*NL*
round
;
and
as
for
you
carrying
,
why
,
wi
'
your
little
arms
you
could
n't
*NL*
carry
a
stone
no
bigger
than
a
turnip
.
You
're
dillicate
made
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
''
he
added
,
with
a
tender
intonation
--
``
that
's
what
Mrs.
Winthrop
*NL*
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
stronger
than
you
think
,
daddy
,
''
said
Eppie
;
``
and
if
there
*NL*
was
n't
stones
enough
to
go
all
round
,
why
they
'll
go
part
o
'
the
way
,
*NL*
and
then
it
'll
be
easier
to
get
sticks
and
things
for
the
rest
.
See
*NL*
here
,
round
the
big
pit
,
what
a
many
stones
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
skipped
forward
to
the
pit
,
meaning
to
lift
one
of
the
stones
and
*NL*
exhibit
her
strength
,
but
she
started
back
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
father
,
just
come
and
look
here
,
''
she
exclaimed
--
``
come
and
see
how
*NL*
the
water
's
gone
down
since
yesterday
.
Why
,
yesterday
the
pit
was
ever
*NL*
so
full
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Silas
,
coming
to
her
side
.
``
Why
,
that
's
the
*NL*
draining
they
've
begun
on
,
since
harvest
,
i
'
Mr.
Osgood
's
fields
,
I
*NL*
reckon
.
The
foreman
said
to
me
the
other
day
,
when
I
passed
by
'em
,
*NL*
``
Master
Marner
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
should
n't
wonder
if
we
lay
your
bit
o
'
*NL*
waste
as
dry
as
a
bone
.
''
It
was
Mr.
Godfrey
Cass
,
he
said
,
had
gone
*NL*
into
the
draining
:
he
'd
been
taking
these
fields
o
'
Mr.
Osgood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
odd
it
'll
seem
to
have
the
old
pit
dried
up
!
''
said
Eppie
,
turning
*NL*
away
,
and
stooping
to
lift
rather
a
large
stone
.
``
See
,
daddy
,
I
can
*NL*
carry
this
quite
well
,
''
she
said
,
going
along
with
much
energy
for
a
*NL*
few
steps
,
but
presently
letting
it
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
're
fine
and
strong
,
are
n't
you
?
''
said
Silas
,
while
Eppie
*NL*
shook
her
aching
arms
and
laughed
.
``
Come
,
come
,
let
us
go
and
sit
down
*NL*
on
the
bank
against
the
stile
there
,
and
have
no
more
lifting
.
You
*NL*
might
hurt
yourself
,
child
.
You
'd
need
have
somebody
to
work
for
*NL*
you
--
and
my
arm
is
n't
over
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
uttered
the
last
sentence
slowly
,
as
if
it
implied
more
than
met
*NL*
the
ear
;
and
Eppie
,
when
they
sat
down
on
the
bank
,
nestled
close
to
*NL*
his
side
,
and
,
taking
hold
caressingly
of
the
arm
that
was
not
over
*NL*
strong
,
held
it
on
her
lap
,
while
Silas
puffed
again
dutifully
at
the
*NL*
pipe
,
which
occupied
his
other
arm
.
An
ash
in
the
hedgerow
behind
made
*NL*
a
fretted
screen
from
the
sun
,
and
threw
happy
playful
shadows
all
*NL*
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
said
Eppie
,
very
gently
,
after
they
had
been
sitting
in
*NL*
silence
a
little
while
,
``
if
I
was
to
be
married
,
ought
I
to
be
married
*NL*
with
my
mother
's
ring
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
gave
an
almost
imperceptible
start
,
though
the
question
fell
in
*NL*
with
the
under-current
of
thought
in
his
own
mind
,
and
then
said
,
in
a
*NL*
subdued
tone
,
``
Why
,
Eppie
,
have
you
been
a-thinking
on
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
this
last
week
,
father
,
''
said
Eppie
,
ingenuously
,
``
since
Aaron
*NL*
talked
to
me
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
he
say
?
''
said
Silas
,
still
in
the
same
subdued
way
,
as
*NL*
if
he
were
anxious
lest
he
should
fall
into
the
slightest
tone
that
was
*NL*
not
for
Eppie
's
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
he
should
like
to
be
married
,
because
he
was
a-going
in
*NL*
four-and-twenty
,
and
had
got
a
deal
of
gardening
work
,
now
Mr.
Mott
's
*NL*
given
up
;
and
he
goes
twice
a-week
regular
to
Mr.
Cass
's
,
and
once
to
*NL*
Mr.
Osgood
's
,
and
they
're
going
to
take
him
on
at
the
Rectory
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
it
as
he
's
wanting
to
marry

''
said
Silas
,
with
rather
a
*NL*
sad
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
me
,
to
be
sure
,
daddy
,
''
said
Eppie
,
with
dimpling
laughter
,
*NL*
kissing
her
father
's
cheek
;
``
as
if
he
'd
want
to
marry
anybody
else
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
mean
to
have
him

do
you

said
Silas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

some
time

''
said
Eppie
,
``
I
do
n't
know
when

Everybody
's
married

some
time

Aaron
says
.
But
I
told
him
that
was

true

I
said

look
at

he
's
never

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Silas
,
``

*NL*
*NL*

said
Eppie

tenderly
.

looking
at

said
Eppie
,
quite
simply
.
``
And
I
should
*NL*
like
things
to
be
so
as
you
need

work
much
.
But
if
it
was
n't
for
*NL*
that
,
I
'd
sooner
things
did
n't
change
.
I
'm
very
happy
:
I
like
Aaron
to
*NL*
be
fond
of
me
,
and
come
and
see
us
often
,
and
behave
pretty
to
you

he
*NL*

behave
pretty

you

n't
he

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
child
,
nobody
could
behave
better

said
Silas
,
emphatically
.
*NL*
``
He
's
his
mother

lad

*NL*
*NL*

But
I
do
n't

Eppie

``
I
should
like
to
go
on
a
*NL*
long
,
long
while
,
just
as
we
are
.
Only
Aaron
does
want
a
change
;
and
*NL*
he
made
me
cry
a
bit
--
only
a
bit
--
because
he
said
I
did
n't
care
for
*NL*
him
,
for
if
I
cared
for
him
I
should
want
us
to
be
married

as
he
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
my
blessed
child
,
''
said
Silas
,
laying
down
his
pipe
as
if
it
were
*NL*
useless
to
pretend
to
smoke
any
longer
,
``
you
're
o'er
young
to
be
*NL*
married
.
We
'll
ask
Mrs.
Winthrop
--
we
'll
ask
Aaron
's
mother
what
_
she
_
*NL*
thinks
:
if
there
's
a
right
thing
to
do
,
she
'll
come
at
it
.
But
there
's
*NL*
this
to
be
thought
on
,
Eppie
:
things
_
will
_
change
,
whether
we
like
it
*NL*
or
no
;
things
wo
n't
go
on
for
a
long
while
just
as
they
are
and
no
*NL*
difference
.
I
shall
get
older
and
helplesser
,
and
be
a
burden
on
you
,
*NL*
belike
,
if
I
do
n't
go
away
from
you
altogether
.
Not
as
I
mean
you
'd
*NL*
think
me
a
burden
--
I
know
you
would
n't
--
but
it
`
ud
be
hard
upon
you
;
*NL*
and
when
I
look
for
`
ard
to
that
,
I
like
to
think
as
you
'd
have
somebody
*NL*
else
besides
me
--
somebody
young
and
strong
,
as
'll
outlast
your
own
*NL*
life
,
and
take
care
on
you
to
the
end
.
''
Silas
paused
,
and
,
resting
his
*NL*
wrists
on
his
knees
,
lifted
his
hands
up
and
down
meditatively
as
he
*NL*
looked
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
would
you
like
me
to
be
married

father
?
''
said
Eppie
,
with
a
*NL*
little
trembling
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
not
be
the
man
to
say
no
,
Eppie
,
''
said
Silas
,
emphatically
;
``
but
*NL*
we
'll
ask
your
godmother

She
'll
wish
the
right
thing
by
you
and
her
*NL*
son
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
they
come
,
then
,

said
Eppie
.
``
Let
us
go
and
meet
'em

Oh
,
the
*NL*
pipe
!
wo
n't
you
have
it
lit
again

said
Eppie
,
lifting
that
*NL*
medicinal
appliance
from
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
child
,
''
said
Silas
,
``
I
've
done
enough
for
to-day
.
I
think

*NL*
mayhap

a
little
of
it

me
more
good

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
While
Silas
and
Eppie
were
seated
on
the
bank
discoursing
in
the
*NL*
fleckered
shade
of
the
ash
tree
,
Miss
Priscilla
Lammeter
was
resisting
*NL*
her
sister
's
arguments
,
that
it
would
be
better
to
take
tea
at
the
Red
*NL*
House
,
and
let
her
father
have
a
long
nap
,
than
drive
home
to
the
*NL*
Warrens
so
soon
after
dinner
.
The
family
party
-LRB-
of
four
only
-RRB-
were
*NL*
seated
round
the
table
in
the
dark
wainscoted
parlour
,
with
the
Sunday
*NL*
dessert
before
them
,
of
fresh
filberts
,
apples
,
and
pears
,
duly
*NL*
ornamented
with
leaves
by
Nancy
's
own
hand
before
the
bells
had
rung
*NL*
for
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
change
has
come
over
the
dark
wainscoted
parlour
since
we
saw
*NL*
it
in
Godfrey
's
bachelor
days
,
and
under
the
wifeless
reign
of
the
old
*NL*
Squire
.
Now
all
is
polish
,
on
which
no
yesterday
's
dust
is
ever
*NL*
allowed
to
rest
,
from
the
yard
's
width
of
oaken
boards
round
the
*NL*
carpet
,
to
the
old
Squire
's
gun
and
whips
and
walking-sticks
,
ranged
on
*NL*
the
stag
's
antlers
above
the
mantelpiece
.
All
other
signs
of
sporting
*NL*
and
outdoor
occupation
Nancy
has
removed
to
another
room
;
but
she
has
*NL*
brought
into
the
Red
House
the
habit
of
filial
reverence
,
and
preserves
*NL*
sacredly
in
a
place
of
honour
these
relics
of
her
husband
's
departed
*NL*
father
.
The
tankards
are
on
the
side-table
still
,
but
the
bossed
*NL*
silver
is
undimmed
by
handling
,
and
there
are
no
dregs
to
send
forth
*NL*
unpleasant
suggestions
:
the
only
prevailing
scent
is
of
the
lavender
*NL*
and
rose-leaves
that
fill
the
vases
of
Derbyshire
spar
.
All
is
purity
*NL*
and
order
in
this
once
dreary
room
,
for
,
fifteen
years
ago
,
it
was
*NL*
entered
by
a
new
presiding
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
father
,
''
said
Nancy
,
''
_
is
_
there
any
call
for
you
to
go
home
to
*NL*
tea
?
May
n't
you
just
as
well
stay
with
us
?
--
such
a
beautiful
evening
*NL*
as
it
's
likely
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
had
been
talking
with
Godfrey
about
the
increasing
*NL*
poor-rate
and
the
ruinous
times
,
and
had
not
heard
the
dialogue
between
*NL*
his
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
you
must
ask
Priscilla
,
''
he
said
,
in
the
once
firm
voice
,
now
*NL*
become
rather
broken
.
``
She
manages
me
and
the
farm
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
reason
good
as
I
should
manage
you
,
father
,
''
said
Priscilla
,
``
else
*NL*
you
'd
be
giving
yourself
your
death
with
rheumatism
.
And
as
for
the
*NL*
farm
,
if
anything
turns
out
wrong
,
as
it
ca
n't
but
do
in
these
times
,
*NL*
there
's
nothing
kills
a
man
so
soon
as
having
nobody
to
find
fault
with
*NL*
but
himself
.
It
's
a
deal
the
best
way
o
'
being
master
,
to
let
somebody
*NL*
else
do
the
ordering
,
and
keep
the
blaming
in
your
own
hands
.
It
`
ud
*NL*
save
many
a
man
a
stroke
,
_
I
_
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
my
dear
,
''
said
her
father
,
with
a
quiet
laugh
,
``
I
did
n't
*NL*
say
you
do
n't
manage
for
everybody
's
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
manage
so
as
you
may
stay
tea
,
Priscilla
,
''
said
Nancy
,
putting
*NL*
her
hand
on
her
sister
's
arm
affectionately
.
``
Come
now
;
and
we
'll
go
*NL*
round
the
garden
while
father
has
his
nap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
child
,
he
'll
have
a
beautiful
nap
in
the
gig
,
for
I
shall
*NL*
drive
.
And
as
for
staying
tea
,
I
ca
n't
hear
of
it
;
for
there
's
this
*NL*
dairymaid
,
now
she
knows
she
's
to
be
married
,
turned
Michaelmas
,
she
'd
*NL*
as
lief
pour
the
new
milk
into
the
pig-trough
as
into
the
pans
.
That
's
*NL*
the
way
with
'em
all
:
it
's
as
if
they
thought
the
world
`
ud
be
new-made
*NL*
because
they
're
to
be
married
.
So
come
and
let
me
put
my
bonnet
on
,
*NL*
and
there
'll
be
time
for
us
to
walk
round
the
garden
while
the
horse
is
*NL*
being
put
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
sisters
were
treading
the
neatly-swept
garden-walks
,
between
*NL*
the
bright
turf
that
contrasted
pleasantly
with
the
dark
cones
and
*NL*
arches
and
wall-like
hedges
of
yew
,
Priscilla
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
as
glad
as
anything
at
your
husband
's
making
that
exchange
o
'
land
*NL*
with
cousin
Osgood
,
and
beginning
the
dairying
.
It
's
a
thousand
pities
*NL*
you
did
n't
do
it
before
;
for
it
'll
give
you
something
to
fill
your
*NL*
mind
.
There
's
nothing
like
a
dairy
if
folks
want
a
bit
o
'
worrit
to
*NL*
make
the
days
pass
.
For
as
for
rubbing
furniture
,
when
you
can
once
*NL*
see
your
face
in
a
table
there
's
nothing
else
to
look
for
;
but
there
's
*NL*
always
something
fresh
with
the
dairy
;
for
even
in
the
depths
o
'
winter
*NL*
there
's
some
pleasure
in
conquering
the
butter
,
and
making
it
come
*NL*
whether
or
no
.
My
dear
,
''
added
Priscilla
,
pressing
her
sister
's
hand
*NL*
affectionately
as
they
walked
side
by
side
,
``
you
'll
never
be
low
when
*NL*
you
've
got
a
dairy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Priscilla
,
''
said
Nancy
,
returning
the
pressure
with
a
grateful
*NL*
glance
of
her
clear
eyes
,
``
but
it
wo
n't
make
up
to
Godfrey
:
a
dairy
's
*NL*
not
so
much
to
a
man
.
And
it
's
only
what
he
cares
for
that
ever
makes
*NL*
me
low
.
I
'm
contented
with
the
blessings
we
have
,
if
he
could
be
*NL*
contented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
drives
me
past
patience
,
''
said
Priscilla
,
impetuously
,
``
that
way
o
'
*NL*
the
men
--
always
wanting
and
wanting
,
and
never
easy
with
what
they
've
*NL*
got
:
they
ca
n't
sit
comfortable
in
their
chairs
when
they
've
neither
*NL*
ache
nor
pain
,
but
either
they
must
stick
a
pipe
in
their
mouths
,
to
*NL*
make
'em
better
than
well
,
or
else
they
must
be
swallowing
something
*NL*
strong
,
though
they
're
forced
to
make
haste
before
the
next
meal
comes
*NL*
in
.
But
joyful
be
it
spoken
,
our
father
was
never
that
sort
o
'
man
.
*NL*
And
if
it
had
pleased
God
to
make
you
ugly
,
like
me
,
so
as
the
men
*NL*
would
n't
ha
'
run
after
you
,
we
might
have
kept
to
our
own
family
,
and
*NL*
had
nothing
to
do
with
folks
as
have
got
uneasy
blood
in
their
veins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
say
so
,
Priscilla
,
''
said
Nancy
,
repenting
that
she
had
*NL*
called
forth
this
outburst
;
``
nobody
has
any
occasion
to
find
fault
with
*NL*
Godfrey
.
It
's
natural
he
should
be
disappointed
at
not
having
any
*NL*
children
:
every
man
likes
to
have
somebody
to
work
for
and
lay
by
for
,
*NL*
and
he
always
counted
so
on
making
a
fuss
with
'em
when
they
were
*NL*
little
.
There
's
many
another
man
`
ud
hanker
more
than
he
does
.
He
's
*NL*
the
best
of
husbands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
,
''
said
Priscilla
,
smiling
sarcastically
,
``
I
know
the
way
o
'
*NL*
wives
;
they
set
one
on
to
abuse
their
husbands
,
and
then
they
turn
*NL*
round
on
one
and
praise
'em
as
if
they
wanted
to
sell
'em
.
But
*NL*
father
'll
be
waiting
for
me
;
we
must
turn
now

*NL*
*NL*
The
large
gig
with
the
steady
old
grey
was
at
the
front
door
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Lammeter
was
already
on
the
stone
steps
,
passing
the
time
in
recalling
*NL*
to
Godfrey
what
very
fine
points
Speckle
had
when
his
master
used
to
*NL*
ride
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
_
would
_
have
a
good
horse
,
you
know
,
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
*NL*
not
liking
that
spirited
time
to
be
quite
effaced
from
the
memory
of
*NL*
his
juniors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
you
bring
Nancy
to
the
Warrens
before
the
week
's
out
,
Mr.
Cass
,
''
*NL*
was
Priscilla
's
parting
injunction
,
as
she
took
the
reins
,
and
shook
*NL*
them
gently
,
by
way
of
friendly
incitement
to
Speckle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
just
take
a
turn
to
the
fields
against
the
Stone-pits
,
Nancy
,
*NL*
and
look
at
the
draining
,
''
said
Godfrey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
in
again
by
tea-time
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
shall
be
back
in
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Godfrey
's
custom
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
to
do
a
little
*NL*
contemplative
farming
in
a
leisurely
walk
.
Nancy
seldom
accompanied
*NL*
him
;
for
the
women
of
her
generation
--
unless
,
like
Priscilla
,
they
took
*NL*
to
outdoor
management
--
were
not
given
to
much
walking
beyond
their
own
*NL*
house
and
garden
,
finding
sufficient
exercise
in
domestic
duties
.
So
,
*NL*
when
Priscilla
was
not
with
her
,
she
usually
sat
with
Mant
's
Bible
*NL*
before
her
,
and
after
following
the
text
with
her
eyes
for
a
little
*NL*
while
,
she
would
gradually
permit
them
to
wander
as
her
thoughts
had
*NL*
already
insisted
on
wandering
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Nancy
's
Sunday
thoughts
were
rarely
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
*NL*
devout
and
reverential
intention
implied
by
the
book
spread
open
before
*NL*
her
.
She
was
not
theologically
instructed
enough
to
discern
very
*NL*
clearly
the
relation
between
the
sacred
documents
of
the
past
which
she
*NL*
opened
without
method
,
and
her
own
obscure
,
simple
life
;
but
the
spirit
*NL*
of
rectitude
,
and
the
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
effect
of
her
*NL*
conduct
on
others
,
which
were
strong
elements
in
Nancy
's
character
,
had
*NL*
made
it
a
habit
with
her
to
scrutinize
her
past
feelings
and
actions
*NL*
with
self-questioning
solicitude
.
Her
mind
not
being
courted
by
a
*NL*
great
variety
of
subjects
,
she
filled
the
vacant
moments
by
living
*NL*
inwardly
,
again
and
again
,
through
all
her
remembered
experience
,
*NL*
especially
through
the
fifteen
years
of
her
married
time
,
in
which
her
*NL*
life
and
its
significance
had
been
doubled
.
She
recalled
the
small
*NL*
details
,
the
words
,
tones
,
and
looks
,
in
the
critical
scenes
which
had
*NL*
opened
a
new
epoch
for
her
by
giving
her
a
deeper
insight
into
the
*NL*
relations
and
trials
of
life
,
or
which
had
called
on
her
for
some
*NL*
little
effort
of
forbearance
,
or
of
painful
adherence
to
an
imagined
or
*NL*
real
duty
--
asking
herself
continually
whether
she
had
been
in
any
*NL*
respect
blamable
.
This
excessive
rumination
and
self-questioning
is
*NL*
perhaps
a
morbid
habit
inevitable
to
a
mind
of
much
moral
sensibility
*NL*
when
shut
out
from
its
due
share
of
outward
activity
and
of
practical
*NL*
claims
on
its
affections
--
inevitable
to
a
noble-hearted
,
childless
*NL*
woman
,
when
her
lot
is
narrow
.
``
I
can
do
so
little
--
have
I
done
it
all
*NL*
well
?
''
is
the
perpetually
recurring
thought
;
and
there
are
no
voices
*NL*
calling
her
away
from
that
soliloquy
,
no
peremptory
demands
to
divert
*NL*
energy
from
vain
regret
or
superfluous
scruple
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
main
thread
of
painful
experience
in
Nancy
's
married
*NL*
life
,
and
on
it
hung
certain
deeply-felt
scenes
,
which
were
the
*NL*
oftenest
revived
in
retrospect
.
The
short
dialogue
with
Priscilla
in
*NL*
the
garden
had
determined
the
current
of
retrospect
in
that
frequent
*NL*
direction
this
particular
Sunday
afternoon
.
The
first
wandering
of
her
*NL*
thought
from
the
text
,
which
she
still
attempted
dutifully
to
follow
*NL*
with
her
eyes
and
silent
lips
,
was
into
an
imaginary
enlargement
of
the
*NL*
defence
she
had
set
up
for
her
husband
against
Priscilla
's
implied
*NL*
blame
.
The
vindication
of
the
loved
object
is
the
best
balm
affection
*NL*
can
find
for
its
wounds
:
--
``
A
man
must
have
so
much
on
his
mind
,
''
is
the
*NL*
belief
by
which
a
wife
often
supports
a
cheerful
face
under
rough
*NL*
answers
and
unfeeling
words
.
And
Nancy
's
deepest
wounds
had
all
come
*NL*
from
the
perception
that
the
absence
of
children
from
their
hearth
was
*NL*
dwelt
on
in
her
husband
's
mind
as
a
privation
to
which
he
could
not
*NL*
reconcile
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
sweet
Nancy
might
have
been
expected
to
feel
still
more
keenly
the
*NL*
denial
of
a
blessing
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
with
all
the
*NL*
varied
expectations
and
preparations
,
solemn
and
prettily
trivial
,
*NL*
which
fill
the
mind
of
a
loving
woman
when
she
expects
to
become
a
*NL*
mother
.
Was
there
not
a
drawer
filled
with
the
neat
work
of
her
hands
,
*NL*
all
unworn
and
untouched
,
just
as
she
had
arranged
it
there
fourteen
*NL*
years
ago
--
just
,
but
for
one
little
dress
,
which
had
been
made
the
*NL*
burial-dress
?
But
under
this
immediate
personal
trial
Nancy
was
so
*NL*
firmly
unmurmuring
,
that
years
ago
she
had
suddenly
renounced
the
habit
*NL*
of
visiting
this
drawer
,
lest
she
should
in
this
way
be
cherishing
a
*NL*
longing
for
what
was
not
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
this
very
severity
towards
any
indulgence
of
what
she
*NL*
held
to
be
sinful
regret
in
herself
,
that
made
her
shrink
from
applying
*NL*
her
own
standard
to
her
husband
.
``
It
is
very
different
--
it
is
much
*NL*
worse
for
a
man
to
be
disappointed
in
that
way
:
a
woman
can
always
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
devoting
herself
to
her
husband
,
but
a
man
wants
*NL*
something
that
will
make
him
look
forward
more
--
and
sitting
by
the
fire
*NL*
is
so
much
duller
to
him
than
to
a
woman
.
''
And
always
,
when
Nancy
*NL*
reached
this
point
in
her
meditations
--
trying
,
with
predetermined
*NL*
sympathy
,
to
see
everything
as
Godfrey
saw
it
--
there
came
a
renewal
of
*NL*
self-questioning
.
_
Had
_
she
done
everything
in
her
power
to
lighten
*NL*
Godfrey
's
privation
?
Had
she
really
been
right
in
the
resistance
which
*NL*
had
cost
her
so
much
pain
six
years
ago
,
and
again
four
years
ago
--
the
*NL*
resistance
to
her
husband
's
wish
that
they
should
adopt
a
child
?
*NL*
Adoption
was
more
remote
from
the
ideas
and
habits
of
that
time
than
of
*NL*
our
own
;
still
Nancy
had
her
opinion
on
it
.
It
was
as
necessary
to
her
*NL*
mind
to
have
an
opinion
on
all
topics
,
not
exclusively
masculine
,
that
*NL*
had
come
under
her
notice
,
as
for
her
to
have
a
precisely
marked
place
*NL*
for
every
article
of
her
personal
property
:
and
her
opinions
were
*NL*
always
principles
to
be
unwaveringly
acted
on
.
They
were
firm
,
not
*NL*
because
of
their
basis
,
but
because
she
held
them
with
a
tenacity
*NL*
inseparable
from
her
mental
action
.
On
all
the
duties
and
proprieties
*NL*
of
life
,
from
filial
behaviour
to
the
arrangements
of
the
evening
*NL*
toilette
,
pretty
Nancy
Lammeter
,
by
the
time
she
was
three-and-twenty
,
*NL*
had
her
unalterable
little
code
,
and
had
formed
every
one
of
her
habits
*NL*
in
strict
accordance
with
that
code
.
She
carried
these
decided
*NL*
judgments
within
her
in
the
most
unobtrusive
way
:
they
rooted
*NL*
themselves
in
her
mind
,
and
grew
there
as
quietly
as
grass
.
Years
ago
,
*NL*
we
know
,
she
insisted
on
dressing
like
Priscilla
,
because
``
it
was
right
*NL*
for
sisters
to
dress
alike
''
,
and
because
``
she
would
do
what
was
right
*NL*
if
she
wore
a
gown
dyed
with
cheese-colouring
''
.
That
was
a
trivial
but
*NL*
typical
instance
of
the
mode
in
which
Nancy
's
life
was
regulated
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
those
rigid
principles
,
and
no
petty
egoistic
feeling
,
*NL*
which
had
been
the
ground
of
Nancy
's
difficult
resistance
to
her
*NL*
husband
's
wish
.
To
adopt
a
child
,
because
children
of
your
own
had
*NL*
been
denied
you
,
was
to
try
and
choose
your
lot
in
spite
of
Providence
:
*NL*
the
adopted
child
,
she
was
convinced
,
would
never
turn
out
well
,
and
*NL*
would
be
a
curse
to
those
who
had
wilfully
and
rebelliously
sought
what
*NL*
it
was
clear
that
,
for
some
high
reason
,
they
were
better
without
.
*NL*
When
you
saw
a
thing
was
not
meant
to
be
,
said
Nancy
,
it
was
a
bounden
*NL*
duty
to
leave
off
so
much
as
wishing
for
it
.
And
so
far
,
perhaps
,
the
*NL*
wisest
of
men
could
scarcely
make
more
than
a
verbal
improvement
in
her
*NL*
principle
.
But
the
conditions
under
which
she
held
it
apparent
that
a
*NL*
thing
was
not
meant
to
be
,
depended
on
a
more
peculiar
mode
of
*NL*
thinking
.
She
would
have
given
up
making
a
purchase
at
a
particular
*NL*
place
if
,
on
three
successive
times
,
rain
,
or
some
other
cause
of
*NL*
Heaven
's
sending
,
had
formed
an
obstacle
;
and
she
would
have
*NL*
anticipated
a
broken
limb
or
other
heavy
misfortune
to
any
one
who
*NL*
persisted
in
spite
of
such
indications
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
you
think
the
child
would
turn
out
ill
?
''
said
Godfrey
,
*NL*
in
his
remonstrances
.
``
She
has
thriven
as
well
as
child
can
do
with
*NL*
the
weaver
;
and
_
he
_
adopted
her
.
There
is
n't
such
a
pretty
little
*NL*
girl
anywhere
else
in
the
parish
,
or
one
fitter
for
the
station
we
*NL*
could
give
her
.
Where
can
be
the
likelihood
of
her
being
a
curse
to
*NL*
anybody
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
Godfrey
,
''
said
Nancy
,
who
was
sitting
with
her
hands
*NL*
tightly
clasped
together
,
and
with
yearning
,
regretful
affection
in
her
*NL*
eyes
.
``
The
child
may
not
turn
out
ill
with
the
weaver
.
But
,
then
,
he
*NL*
did
n't
go
to
seek
her
,
as
we
should
be
doing
.
It
will
be
wrong
:
I
feel
*NL*
sure
it
will
.
Do
n't
you
remember
what
that
lady
we
met
at
the
Royston
*NL*
Baths
told
us
about
the
child
her
sister
adopted
?
That
was
the
only
*NL*
adopting
I
ever
heard
of
:
and
the
child
was
transported
when
it
was
*NL*
twenty-three
.
Dear
Godfrey
,
do
n't
ask
me
to
do
what
I
know
is
wrong
:
I
*NL*
should
never
be
happy
again
.
I
know
it
's
very
hard
for
_
you
_
--
it
's
*NL*
easier
for
me
--
but
it
's
the
will
of
Providence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
seem
singular
that
Nancy
--
with
her
religious
theory
pieced
*NL*
together
out
of
narrow
social
traditions
,
fragments
of
church
doctrine
*NL*
imperfectly
understood
,
and
girlish
reasonings
on
her
small
*NL*
experience
--
should
have
arrived
by
herself
at
a
way
of
thinking
so
*NL*
nearly
akin
to
that
of
many
devout
people
,
whose
beliefs
are
held
in
*NL*
the
shape
of
a
system
quite
remote
from
her
knowledge
--
singular
,
if
we
*NL*
did
not
know
that
human
beliefs
,
like
all
other
natural
growths
,
elude
*NL*
the
barriers
of
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
had
from
the
first
specified
Eppie
,
then
about
twelve
years
*NL*
old
,
as
a
child
suitable
for
them
to
adopt
.
It
had
never
occurred
to
*NL*
him
that
Silas
would
rather
part
with
his
life
than
with
Eppie
.
Surely
*NL*
the
weaver
would
wish
the
best
to
the
child
he
had
taken
so
much
*NL*
trouble
with
,
and
would
be
glad
that
such
good
fortune
should
happen
to
*NL*
her
:
she
would
always
be
very
grateful
to
him
,
and
he
would
be
well
*NL*
provided
for
to
the
end
of
his
life
--
provided
for
as
the
excellent
part
*NL*
he
had
done
by
the
child
deserved
.
Was
it
not
an
appropriate
thing
for
*NL*
people
in
a
higher
station
to
take
a
charge
off
the
hands
of
a
man
in
a
*NL*
lower
?
It
seemed
an
eminently
appropriate
thing
to
Godfrey
,
for
*NL*
reasons
that
were
known
only
to
himself
;
and
by
a
common
fallacy
,
he
*NL*
imagined
the
measure
would
be
easy
because
he
had
private
motives
for
*NL*
desiring
it
.
This
was
rather
a
coarse
mode
of
estimating
Silas
's
*NL*
relation
to
Eppie
;
but
we
must
remember
that
many
of
the
impressions
*NL*
which
Godfrey
was
likely
to
gather
concerning
the
labouring
people
*NL*
around
him
would
favour
the
idea
that
deep
affections
can
hardly
go
*NL*
along
with
callous
palms
and
scant
means
;
and
he
had
not
had
the
*NL*
opportunity
,
even
if
he
had
had
the
power
,
of
entering
intimately
into
*NL*
all
that
was
exceptional
in
the
weaver
's
experience
.
It
was
only
the
*NL*
want
of
adequate
knowledge
that
could
have
made
it
possible
for
Godfrey
*NL*
deliberately
to
entertain
an
unfeeling
project
:
his
natural
kindness
*NL*
had
outlived
that
blighting
time
of
cruel
wishes
,
and
Nancy
's
praise
of
*NL*
him
as
a
husband
was
not
founded
entirely
on
a
wilful
illusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
right
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
when
she
had
recalled
all
their
*NL*
scenes
of
discussion
--
``
I
feel
I
was
right
to
say
him
nay
,
though
it
*NL*
hurt
me
more
than
anything
;
but
how
good
Godfrey
has
been
about
it
!
*NL*
Many
men
would
have
been
very
angry
with
me
for
standing
out
against
*NL*
their
wishes
;
and
they
might
have
thrown
out
that
they
'd
had
ill-luck
*NL*
in
marrying
me
;
but
Godfrey
has
never
been
the
man
to
say
me
an
unkind
*NL*
word
.
It
's
only
what
he
ca
n't
hide
:
everything
seems
so
blank
to
him
,
*NL*
I
know
;
and
the
land
--
what
a
difference
it
`
ud
make
to
him
,
when
he
*NL*
goes
to
see
after
things
,
if
he
'd
children
growing
up
that
he
was
doing
*NL*
it
all
for
!
But
I
wo
n't
murmur
;
and
perhaps
if
he
'd
married
a
woman
*NL*
who
'd
have
had
children
,
she
'd
have
vexed
him
in
other
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
possibility
was
Nancy
's
chief
comfort
;
and
to
give
it
greater
*NL*
strength
,
she
laboured
to
make
it
impossible
that
any
other
wife
should
*NL*
have
had
more
perfect
tenderness
.
She
had
been
_
forced
_
to
vex
him
by
*NL*
that
one
denial
.
Godfrey
was
not
insensible
to
her
loving
effort
,
and
*NL*
did
Nancy
no
injustice
as
to
the
motives
of
her
obstinacy
.
It
was
*NL*
impossible
to
have
lived
with
her
fifteen
years
and
not
be
aware
that
*NL*
an
unselfish
clinging
to
the
right
,
and
a
sincerity
clear
as
the
*NL*
flower-born
dew
,
were
her
main
characteristics
;
indeed
,
Godfrey
felt
*NL*
this
so
strongly
,
that
his
own
more
wavering
nature
,
too
averse
to
*NL*
facing
difficulty
to
be
unvaryingly
simple
and
truthful
,
was
kept
in
a
*NL*
certain
awe
of
this
gentle
wife
who
watched
his
looks
with
a
yearning
*NL*
to
obey
them
.
It
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
he
should
ever
confess
*NL*
to
her
the
truth
about
Eppie
:
she
would
never
recover
from
the
*NL*
repulsion
the
story
of
his
earlier
marriage
would
create
,
told
to
her
*NL*
now
,
after
that
long
concealment
.
And
the
child
,
too
,
he
thought
,
must
*NL*
become
an
object
of
repulsion
:
the
very
sight
of
her
would
be
painful
.
*NL*
The
shock
to
Nancy
's
mingled
pride
and
ignorance
of
the
world
's
evil
*NL*
might
even
be
too
much
for
her
delicate
frame
.
Since
he
had
married
*NL*
her
with
that
secret
on
his
heart
,
he
must
keep
it
there
to
the
last
.
*NL*
Whatever
else
he
did
,
he
could
not
make
an
irreparable
breach
between
*NL*
himself
and
this
long-loved
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
why
could
he
not
make
up
his
mind
to
the
absence
of
children
*NL*
from
a
hearth
brightened
by
such
a
wife
?
Why
did
his
mind
fly
uneasily
*NL*
to
that
void
,
as
if
it
were
the
sole
reason
why
life
was
not
thoroughly
*NL*
joyous
to
him
?
I
suppose
it
is
the
way
with
all
men
and
women
who
*NL*
reach
middle
age
without
the
clear
perception
that
life
never
_
can
_
be
*NL*
thoroughly
joyous
:
under
the
vague
dullness
of
the
grey
hours
,
*NL*
dissatisfaction
seeks
a
definite
object
,
and
finds
it
in
the
privation
*NL*
of
an
untried
good
.
Dissatisfaction
seated
musingly
on
a
childless
*NL*
hearth
,
thinks
with
envy
of
the
father
whose
return
is
greeted
by
young
*NL*
voices
--
seated
at
the
meal
where
the
little
heads
rise
one
above
*NL*
another
like
nursery
plants
,
it
sees
a
black
care
hovering
behind
every
*NL*
one
of
them
,
and
thinks
the
impulses
by
which
men
abandon
freedom
,
and
*NL*
seek
for
ties
,
are
surely
nothing
but
a
brief
madness
.
In
Godfrey
's
*NL*
case
there
were
further
reasons
why
his
thoughts
should
be
continually
*NL*
solicited
by
this
one
point
in
his
lot
:
his
conscience
,
never
*NL*
thoroughly
easy
about
Eppie
,
now
gave
his
childless
home
the
aspect
of
*NL*
a
retribution
;
and
as
the
time
passed
on
,
under
Nancy
's
refusal
to
*NL*
adopt
her
,
any
retrieval
of
his
error
became
more
and
more
difficult
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
Sunday
afternoon
it
was
already
four
years
since
there
had
been
*NL*
any
allusion
to
the
subject
between
them
,
and
Nancy
supposed
that
it
*NL*
was
for
ever
buried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
he
'll
mind
it
less
or
more
as
he
gets
older
,
''
she
thought
;
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
more
.
Aged
people
feel
the
miss
of
children
:
what
would
*NL*
father
do
without
Priscilla
?
And
if
I
die
,
Godfrey
will
be
very
*NL*
lonely
--
not
holding
together
with
his
brothers
much
.
But
I
wo
n't
be
*NL*
over-anxious
,
and
trying
to
make
things
out
beforehand
:
I
must
do
my
*NL*
best
for
the
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
last
thought
Nancy
roused
herself
from
her
reverie
,
and
*NL*
turned
her
eyes
again
towards
the
forsaken
page
.
It
had
been
forsaken
*NL*
longer
than
she
imagined
,
for
she
was
presently
surprised
by
the
*NL*
appearance
of
the
servant
with
the
tea-things
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
a
*NL*
little
before
the
usual
time
for
tea
;
but
Jane
had
her
reasons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
master
come
into
the
yard
,
Jane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
'm
,
he
is
n't
,
''
said
Jane
,
with
a
slight
emphasis
,
of
which
,
*NL*
however
,
her
mistress
took
no
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
've
seen
'em
,
'm
,
''
continued
Jane
,
after
a
*NL*
pause
,
``
but
there
's
folks
making
haste
all
one
way
,
afore
the
front
*NL*
window
.
I
doubt
something
's
happened
.
There
's
niver
a
man
to
be
seen
*NL*
i
'
the
yard
,
else
I
'd
send
and
see
.
I
've
been
up
into
the
top
attic
,
*NL*
but
there
's
no
seeing
anything
for
trees
.
I
hope
nobody
's
hurt
,
that
's
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
daresay
there
's
nothing
much
the
matter
,
''
said
Nancy
.
``
It
's
*NL*
perhaps
Mr.
Snell
's
bull
got
out
again
,
as
he
did
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
he
may
n't
gore
anybody
then
,
that
's
all
,
''
said
Jane
,
not
*NL*
altogether
despising
a
hypothesis
which
covered
a
few
imaginary
*NL*
calamities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
girl
is
always
terrifying
me
,
''
thought
Nancy
;
``
I
wish
Godfrey
*NL*
would
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
to
the
front
window
and
looked
as
far
as
she
could
see
along
*NL*
the
road
,
with
an
uneasiness
which
she
felt
to
be
childish
,
for
there
*NL*
were
now
no
such
signs
of
excitement
as
Jane
had
spoken
of
,
and
Godfrey
*NL*
would
not
be
likely
to
return
by
the
village
road
,
but
by
the
fields
.
*NL*
She
continued
to
stand
,
however
,
looking
at
the
placid
churchyard
with
*NL*
the
long
shadows
of
the
gravestones
across
the
bright
green
hillocks
,
*NL*
and
at
the
glowing
autumn
colours
of
the
Rectory
trees
beyond
.
Before
*NL*
such
calm
external
beauty
the
presence
of
a
vague
fear
is
more
*NL*
distinctly
felt
--
like
a
raven
flapping
its
slow
wing
across
the
sunny
*NL*
air
.
Nancy
wished
more
and
more
that
Godfrey
would
come
in
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
opened
the
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
Nancy
felt
*NL*
that
it
was
her
husband
.
She
turned
from
the
window
with
gladness
in
*NL*
her
eyes
,
for
the
wife
's
chief
dread
was
stilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
I
'm
so
thankful
you
're
come
,
''
she
said
,
going
towards
him
.
``
I
*NL*
began
to
get
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
abruptly
,
for
Godfrey
was
laying
down
his
hat
with
trembling
*NL*
hands
,
and
turned
towards
her
with
a
pale
face
and
a
strange
*NL*
unanswering
glance
,
as
if
he
saw
her
indeed
,
but
saw
her
as
part
of
a
*NL*
scene
invisible
to
herself
.
She
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
,
not
daring
*NL*
to
speak
again
;
but
he
left
the
touch
unnoticed
,
and
threw
himself
into
*NL*
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
was
already
at
the
door
with
the
hissing
urn
.
``
Tell
her
to
keep
*NL*
away
,
will
you
?
''
said
Godfrey
;
and
when
the
door
was
closed
again
he
*NL*
exerted
himself
to
speak
more
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
Nancy
--
there
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
a
chair
opposite
him
.
*NL*
``
I
came
back
as
soon
as
I
could
,
to
hinder
anybody
's
telling
you
but
*NL*
me
.
I
've
had
a
great
shock
--
but
I
care
most
about
the
shock
it
'll
be
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
father
and
Priscilla
?
''
said
Nancy
,
with
quivering
lips
,
*NL*
clasping
her
hands
together
tightly
on
her
lap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
nobody
living
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
unequal
to
the
considerate
*NL*
skill
with
which
he
would
have
wished
to
make
his
revelation
.
``
It
's
*NL*
Dunstan
--
my
brother
Dunstan
,
that
we
lost
sight
of
sixteen
years
ago
.
*NL*
We
've
found
him
--
found
his
body
--
his
skeleton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
deep
dread
Godfrey
's
look
had
created
in
Nancy
made
her
feel
these
*NL*
words
a
relief
.
She
sat
in
comparative
calmness
to
hear
what
else
he
*NL*
had
to
tell
.
He
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Stone-pit
has
gone
dry
suddenly
--
from
the
draining
,
I
suppose
;
and
*NL*
there
he
lies
--
has
lain
for
sixteen
years
,
wedged
between
two
great
*NL*
stones
.
There
's
his
watch
and
seals
,
and
there
's
my
gold-handled
*NL*
hunting-whip
,
with
my
name
on
:
he
took
it
away
,
without
my
knowing
,
the
*NL*
day
he
went
hunting
on
Wildfire
,
the
last
time
he
was
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
paused
:
it
was
not
so
easy
to
say
what
came
next
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
think
he
drowned
himself
?
''
said
Nancy
,
almost
wondering
that
her
*NL*
husband
should
be
so
deeply
shaken
by
what
had
happened
all
those
years
*NL*
ago
to
an
unloved
brother
,
of
whom
worse
things
had
been
augured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
fell
in
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
,
as
if
he
*NL*
felt
some
deep
meaning
in
the
fact
.
Presently
he
added
:
``
Dunstan
was
*NL*
the
man
that
robbed
Silas
Marner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rushed
to
Nancy
's
face
and
neck
at
this
surprise
and
shame
,
*NL*
for
she
had
been
bred
up
to
regard
even
a
distant
kinship
with
crime
as
*NL*
a
dishonour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Godfrey
!
''
she
said
,
with
compassion
in
her
tone
,
for
she
had
*NL*
immediately
reflected
that
the
dishonour
must
be
felt
still
more
keenly
*NL*
by
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
the
money
in
the
pit
,
''
he
continued
--
``
all
the
weaver
's
*NL*
money
.
Everything
's
been
gathered
up
,
and
they
're
taking
the
skeleton
*NL*
to
the
Rainbow
.
But
I
came
back
to
tell
you
:
there
was
no
hindering
*NL*
it
;
you
must
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
,
looking
on
the
ground
for
two
long
minutes
.
Nancy
would
*NL*
have
said
some
words
of
comfort
under
this
disgrace
,
but
she
refrained
,
*NL*
from
an
instinctive
sense
that
there
was
something
behind
--
that
Godfrey
*NL*
had
something
else
to
tell
her
.
Presently
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
her
*NL*
face
,
and
kept
them
fixed
on
her
,
as
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
comes
to
light
,
Nancy
,
sooner
or
later
.
When
God
Almighty
*NL*
wills
it
,
our
secrets
are
found
out
.
I
've
lived
with
a
secret
on
my
*NL*
mind
,
but
I
'll
keep
it
from
you
no
longer
.
I
would
n't
have
you
know
it
*NL*
by
somebody
else
,
and
not
by
me
--
I
would
n't
have
you
find
it
out
after
*NL*
I
'm
dead
.
I
'll
tell
you
now
.
It
's
been
``
I
will
''
and
``
I
wo
n't
''
with
me
*NL*
all
my
life
--
I
'll
make
sure
of
myself
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
's
utmost
dread
had
returned
.
The
eyes
of
the
husband
and
wife
*NL*
met
with
awe
in
them
,
as
at
a
crisis
which
suspended
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nancy
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
slowly
,
``
when
I
married
you
,
I
hid
something
*NL*
from
you
--
something
I
ought
to
have
told
you
.
That
woman
Marner
found
*NL*
dead
in
the
snow
--
Eppie
's
mother
--
that
wretched
woman
--
was
my
wife
:
*NL*
Eppie
is
my
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
dreading
the
effect
of
his
confession
.
But
Nancy
sat
quite
*NL*
still
,
only
that
her
eyes
dropped
and
ceased
to
meet
his
.
She
was
pale
*NL*
and
quiet
as
a
meditative
statue
,
clasping
her
hands
on
her
lap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
never
think
the
same
of
me
again
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
after
a
little
*NL*
while
,
with
some
tremor
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
n't
to
have
left
the
child
unowned
:
I
ought
n't
to
have
kept
it
*NL*
from
you
.
But
I
could
n't
bear
to
give
you
up
,
Nancy
.
I
was
led
away
*NL*
into
marrying
her
--
I
suffered
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
Nancy
was
silent
,
looking
down
;
and
he
almost
expected
that
she
*NL*
would
presently
get
up
and
say
she
would
go
to
her
father
's
.
How
could
*NL*
she
have
any
mercy
for
faults
that
must
seem
so
black
to
her
,
with
her
*NL*
simple
,
severe
notions
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
last
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
to
his
again
and
spoke
.
There
was
*NL*
no
indignation
in
her
voice
--
only
deep
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Godfrey
,
if
you
had
but
told
me
this
six
years
ago
,
we
could
have
done
*NL*
some
of
our
duty
by
the
child
.
Do
you
think
I
'd
have
refused
to
take
*NL*
her
in
,
if
I
'd
known
she
was
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Godfrey
felt
all
the
bitterness
of
an
error
that
was
not
*NL*
simply
futile
,
but
had
defeated
its
own
end
.
He
had
not
measured
this
*NL*
wife
with
whom
he
had
lived
so
long
.
But
she
spoke
again
,
with
more
*NL*
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
--
Oh
,
Godfrey
--
if
we
'd
had
her
from
the
first
,
if
you
'd
taken
to
*NL*
her
as
you
ought
,
she
'd
have
loved
me
for
her
mother
--
and
you
'd
have
*NL*
been
happier
with
me
:
I
could
better
have
bore
my
little
baby
dying
,
*NL*
and
our
life
might
have
been
more
like
what
we
used
to
think
it
`
ud
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
fell
,
and
Nancy
ceased
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
would
n't
have
married
me
then
,
Nancy
,
if
I
'd
told
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Godfrey
,
urged
,
in
the
bitterness
of
his
self-reproach
,
to
prove
to
*NL*
himself
that
his
conduct
had
not
been
utter
folly
.
``
You
may
think
you
*NL*
would
now
,
but
you
would
n't
then
.
With
your
pride
and
your
father
's
,
*NL*
you
'd
have
hated
having
anything
to
do
with
me
after
the
talk
there
'd
*NL*
have
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
what
I
should
have
done
about
that
,
Godfrey

I
should
*NL*
never

married
anybody
else

But
I
was
n't
worth
doing
wrong
*NL*
for

nothing
is
in
this
world

Nothing
is
so
good
as
it
seems
*NL*
beforehand
--
not
even
our
marrying
was
n't
,
you
see
.
''
There
was
a
faint
*NL*
sad
smile
on
Nancy
's
face
as
she
said
the
last
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
worse
man
than
you
thought
I
was

said
Godfrey
,
rather
*NL*
tremulously
.
``
Can
you
forgive
me
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wrong
to
me
is
but
little

been
good

fifteen

another
you

the

made
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
can
take
Eppie
now

said
Godfrey
.
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

Nancy

shaking
her

sadly
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
Between
eight
and
nine
o'clock
that
evening
,
Eppie
and
Silas
were
*NL*
seated
alone
in
the
cottage
.
After
the
great
excitement
the
weaver
had
*NL*
undergone
from
the
events
of
the
afternoon
,
he
had
felt
a
longing
for
*NL*
this
quietude
,
and
had
even
begged
Mrs.
Winthrop
and
Aaron
,
who
had
*NL*
naturally
lingered
behind
every
one
else
,
to
leave
him
alone
with
his
*NL*
child
.
The
excitement
had
not
passed
away
:
it
had
only
reached
that
*NL*
stage
when
the
keenness
of
the
susceptibility
makes
external
stimulus
*NL*
intolerable
--
when
there
is
no
sense
of
weariness
,
but
rather
an
*NL*
intensity
of
inward
life
,
under
which
sleep
is
an
impossibility
.
Any
*NL*
one
who
has
watched
such
moments
in
other
men
remembers
the
brightness
*NL*
of
the
eyes
and
the
strange
definiteness
that
comes
over
coarse
*NL*
features
from
that
transient
influence
.
It
is
as
if
a
new
fineness
of
*NL*
ear
for
all
spiritual
voices
had
sent
wonder-working
vibrations
through
*NL*
the
heavy
mortal
frame
--
as
if
``
beauty
born
of
murmuring
sound
''
had
*NL*
passed
into
the
face
of
the
listener
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
's
face
showed
that
sort
of
transfiguration
,
as
he
sat
in
his
*NL*
arm-chair
and
looked
at
Eppie
.
She
had
drawn
her
own
chair
towards
his
*NL*
knees
,
and
leaned
forward
,
holding
both
his
hands
,
while
she
looked
up
*NL*
at
him
.
On
the
table
near
them
,
lit
by
a
candle
,
lay
the
recovered
*NL*
gold
--
the
old
long-loved
gold
,
ranged
in
orderly
heaps
,
as
Silas
used
*NL*
to
range
it
in
the
days
when
it
was
his
only
joy
.
He
had
been
telling
*NL*
her
how
he
used
to
count
it
every
night
,
and
how
his
soul
was
utterly
*NL*
desolate
till
she
was
sent
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
first
,
I
'd
a
sort
o
'
feeling
come
across
me
now
and
then
,
''
he
was
*NL*
saying
in
a
subdued
tone
,
``
as
if
you
might
be
changed
into
the
gold
*NL*
again
;
for
sometimes
,
turn
my
head
which
way
I
would
,
I
seemed
to
see
*NL*
the
gold
;
and
I
thought
I
should
be
glad
if
I
could
feel
it
,
and
find
*NL*
it
was
come
back
.
But
that
did
n't
last
long
.
After
a
bit
,
I
should
*NL*
have
thought
it
was
a
curse
come
again
,
if
it
had
drove
you
from
me
,
*NL*
for
I
'd
got
to
feel
the
need
o
'
your
looks
and
your
voice
and
the
touch
*NL*
o
'
your
little
fingers
.
You
did
n't
know
then
,
Eppie
,
when
you
were
*NL*
such
a
little
un
--
you
did
n't
know
what
your
old
father
Silas
felt
for
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
know
now
,
father
,
''
said
Eppie
.
``
If
it
had
n't
been
for
you
,
*NL*
they
'd
have
taken
me
to
the
workhouse
,
and
there
'd
have
been
nobody
to
*NL*
love
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
my
precious
child
,
the
blessing
was
mine
.
If
you
had
n't
been
sent
*NL*
to
save
me
,
I
should
ha
'
gone
to
the
grave
in
my
misery
.
The
money
was
*NL*
taken
away
from
me
in
time
;
and
you
see
it
's
been
kept
--
kept
till
it
*NL*
was
wanted
for
you
.
It
's
wonderful
--
our
life
is
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
sat
in
silence
a
few
minutes
,
looking
at
the
money
.
``
It
takes
no
*NL*
hold
of
me
now
,
''
he
said
,
ponderingly
--
``
the
money
does
n't
.
I
wonder
if
*NL*
it
ever
could
again
--
I
doubt
it
might
,
if
I
lost
you
,
Eppie
.
I
might
*NL*
come
to
think
I
was
forsaken
again
,
and
lose
the
feeling
that
God
was
*NL*
good
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
door
;
and
Eppie
was
obliged
*NL*
to
rise
without
answering
Silas
.
Beautiful
she
looked
,
with
the
*NL*
tenderness
of
gathering
tears
in
her
eyes
and
a
slight
flush
on
her
*NL*
cheeks
,
as
she
stepped
to
open
the
door
.
The
flush
deepened
when
she
*NL*
saw
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Godfrey
Cass
.
She
made
her
little
rustic
curtsy
,
and
*NL*
held
the
door
wide
for
them
to
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
disturbing
you
very
late
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Cass
,
taking
*NL*
Eppie
's
hand
,
and
looking
in
her
face
with
an
expression
of
anxious
*NL*
interest
and
admiration
.
Nancy
herself
was
pale
and
tremulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eppie
,
after
placing
chairs
for
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Cass
,
went
to
stand
*NL*
against
Silas
,
opposite
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Marner
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
trying
to
speak
with
perfect
firmness
,
*NL*
``
it
's
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
see
you
with
your
money
again
,
that
*NL*
you
've
been
deprived
of
so
many
years
.
It
was
one
of
my
family
did
you
*NL*
the
wrong
--
the
more
grief
to
me
--
and
I
feel
bound
to
make
up
to
you
for
*NL*
it
in
every
way
.
Whatever
I
can
do
for
you
will
be
nothing
but
paying
*NL*
a
debt
,
even
if
I
looked
no
further
than
the
robbery
.
But
there
are
*NL*
other
things
I
'm
beholden
--
shall
be
beholden
to
you
for
,
Marner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
checked
himself
.
It
had
been
agreed
between
him
and
his
wife
*NL*
that
the
subject
of
his
fatherhood
should
be
approached
very
carefully
,
*NL*
and
that
,
if
possible
,
the
disclosure
should
be
reserved
for
the
*NL*
future
,
so
that
it
might
be
made
to
Eppie
gradually
.
Nancy
had
urged
*NL*
this
,
because
she
felt
strongly
the
painful
light
in
which
Eppie
must
*NL*
inevitably
see
the
relation
between
her
father
and
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
,
always
ill
at
ease
when
he
was
being
spoken
to
by
``
betters
''
,
*NL*
such
as
Mr.
Cass
--
tall
,
powerful
,
florid
men
,
seen
chiefly
on
*NL*
horseback
--
answered
with
some
constraint
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
I
've
a
deal
to
thank
you
for
a
`
ready
.
As
for
the
robbery
,
I
*NL*
count
it
no
loss
to
me
.
And
if
I
did
,
you
could
n't
help
it
:
you
are
n't
*NL*
answerable
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
look
at
it
in
that
way
,
Marner
,
but
I
never
can
;
and
I
hope
*NL*
you
'll
let
me
act
according
to
my
own
feeling
of
what
's
just
.
I
know
*NL*
you
're
easily
contented
:
you
've
been
a
hard-working
man
all
your
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
yes
,
''
said
Marner
,
meditatively
.
``
I
should
ha
'
been
bad
off
*NL*
without
my
work
:
it
was
what
I
held
by
when
everything
else
was
gone
*NL*
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
applying
Marner
's
words
simply
to
his
bodily
wants
,
*NL*
``
it
was
a
good
trade
for
you
in
this
country
,
because
there
's
been
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
linen-weaving
to
be
done
.
But
you
're
getting
rather
past
*NL*
such
close
work
,
Marner
:
it
's
time
you
laid
by
and
had
some
rest
.
You
*NL*
look
a
good
deal
pulled
down
,
though
you
're
not
an
old
man
,
_
are
_
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty-five
,
as
near
as
I
can
say
,
sir
,
''
said
Silas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
,
you
may
live
thirty
years
longer
--
look
at
old
Macey
!
And
that
*NL*
money
on
the
table
,
after
all
,
is
but
little
.
It
wo
n't
go
far
either
*NL*
way
--
whether
it
's
put
out
to
interest
,
or
you
were
to
live
on
it
as
*NL*
long
as
it
would
last
:
it
would
n't
go
far
if
you
'd
nobody
to
keep
but
*NL*
yourself
,
and
you
've
had
two
to
keep
for
a
good
many
years
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
sir
,
''
said
Silas
,
unaffected
by
anything
Godfrey
was
saying
,
``
I
'm
*NL*
in
no
fear
o
'
want
.
We
shall
do
very
well
--
Eppie
and
me
`
ull
do
well
*NL*
enough
.
There
's
few
working-folks
have
got
so
much
laid
by
as
that
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
gentlefolks
,
but
I
look
upon
it
as
a
*NL*
deal
--
almost
too
much
.
And
as
for
us
,
it
's
little
we
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
the
garden
,
father
,
''
said
Eppie
,
blushing
up
to
the
ears
the
*NL*
moment
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
love
a
garden
,
do
you
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Nancy
,
thinking
that
this
*NL*
turn
in
the
point
of
view
might
help
her
husband
.
``
We
should
agree
in
*NL*
that
:
I
give
a
deal
of
time
to
the
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
's
plenty
of
gardening
at
the
Red
House
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
*NL*
surprised
at
the
difficulty
he
found
in
approaching
a
proposition
which
*NL*
had
seemed
so
easy
to
him
in
the
distance
.
``
You
've
done
a
good
part
by
*NL*
Eppie
,
Marner
,
for
sixteen
years
.
It
`
ud
be
a
great
comfort
to
you
to
*NL*
see
her
well
provided
for
,
would
n't
it
?
She
looks
blooming
and
*NL*
healthy
,
but
not
fit
for
any
hardships
:
she
does
n't
look
like
a
*NL*
strapping
girl
come
of
working
parents
.
You
'd
like
to
see
her
taken
*NL*
care
of
by
those
who
can
leave
her
well
off
,
and
make
a
lady
of
her
;
*NL*
she
's
more
fit
for
it
than
for
a
rough
life
,
such
as
she
might
come
to
*NL*
have
in
a
few
years
'
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
slight
flush
came
over
Marner
's
face
,
and
disappeared
,
like
a
passing
*NL*
gleam
.
Eppie
was
simply
wondering
Mr.
Cass
should
talk
so
about
things
*NL*
that
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
reality
;
but
Silas
was
hurt
and
*NL*
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
take
your
meaning
,
sir
,
''
he
answered
,
not
having
words
at
*NL*
command
to
express
the
mingled
feelings
with
which
he
had
heard
Mr.
*NL*
Cass
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
meaning
is
this
,
Marner
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
determined
to
come
to
*NL*
the
point
.
``
Mrs.
Cass
and
I
,
you
know
,
have
no
children
--
nobody
to
*NL*
benefit
by
our
good
home
and
everything
else
we
have
--
more
than
enough
*NL*
for
ourselves
.
And
we
should
like
to
have
somebody
in
the
place
of
a
*NL*
daughter
to
us
--
we
should
like
to
have
Eppie
,
and
treat
her
in
every
*NL*
way
as
our
own
child
.
It
`
ud
be
a
great
comfort
to
you
in
your
old
*NL*
age
,
I
hope
,
to
see
her
fortune
made
in
that
way
,
after
you
've
been
at
*NL*
the
trouble
of
bringing
her
up
so
well
.
And
it
's
right
you
should
have
*NL*
every
reward
for
that
.
And
Eppie
,
I
'm
sure
,
will
always
love
you
and
*NL*
be
grateful
to
you
:
she
'd
come
and
see
you
very
often
,
and
we
should
*NL*
all
be
on
the
look-out
to
do
everything
we
could
towards
making
you
*NL*
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
plain
man
like
Godfrey
Cass
,
speaking
under
some
embarrassment
,
*NL*
necessarily
blunders
on
words
that
are
coarser
than
his
intentions
,
and
*NL*
that
are
likely
to
fall
gratingly
on
susceptible
feelings
.
While
he
had
*NL*
been
speaking
,
Eppie
had
quietly
passed
her
arm
behind
Silas
's
head
,
*NL*
and
let
her
hand
rest
against
it
caressingly
:
she
felt
him
trembling
*NL*
violently
.
He
was
silent
for
some
moments
when
Mr.
Cass
had
*NL*
ended
--
powerless
under
the
conflict
of
emotions
,
all
alike
painful
.
*NL*
Eppie
's
heart
was
swelling
at
the
sense
that
her
father
was
in
*NL*
distress
;
and
she
was
just
going
to
lean
down
and
speak
to
him
,
when
*NL*
one
struggling
dread
at
last
gained
the
mastery
over
every
other
in
*NL*
Silas
,
and
he
said
,
faintly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eppie
,
my
child
,
speak
.
I
wo
n't
stand
in
your
way
.
Thank
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Cass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eppie
took
her
hand
from
her
father
's
head
,
and
came
forward
a
step
.
*NL*
Her
cheeks
were
flushed
,
but
not
with
shyness
this
time
:
the
sense
that
*NL*
her
father
was
in
doubt
and
suffering
banished
that
sort
of
*NL*
self-consciousness
.
She
dropped
a
low
curtsy
,
first
to
Mrs.
Cass
and
*NL*
then
to
Mr.
Cass
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank

But
I
ca
n't

own
anybody
nearer

I
do

want
to
be
a
lady

*NL*
all
the

-LRB-
here
Eppie
dropped
another
curtsy
-RRB-
.
``
I

give
up
*NL*
the
folks

've
been
used
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
Eppie
's
lips
began
to
tremble
a
little
at
the
last
words
.
She
*NL*
retreated
to
her
father
's
chair
again
,
and
held
him
round
the
neck
:
*NL*
while
Silas
,
with
a
subdued
sob
,
put
up
his
hand
to
grasp
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
were
in
Nancy
's
eyes
,
but
her
sympathy
with
Eppie
was
,
*NL*
naturally
,
divided
with
distress
on
her
husband
's
account
.
She
dared
*NL*
not
speak
,
wondering
what
was
going
on
in
her
husband
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
felt
an
irritation
inevitable
to
almost
all
of
us
when
we
*NL*
encounter
an
unexpected
obstacle
.
He
had
been
full
of
his
own
*NL*
penitence
and
resolution
to
retrieve
his
error
as
far
as
the
time
was
*NL*
left
to
him
;
he
was
possessed
with
all-important
feelings
,
that
were
to
*NL*
lead
to
a
predetermined
course
of
action
which
he
had
fixed
on
as
the
*NL*
right
,
and
he
was
not
prepared
to
enter
with
lively
appreciation
into
*NL*
other
people
's
feelings
counteracting
his
virtuous
resolves
.
The
*NL*
agitation
with
which
he
spoke
again
was
not
quite
unmixed
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
've
a
claim
on
you
,
Eppie
--
the
strongest
of
all
claims
.
It
's
my
*NL*
duty
,
Marner
,
to
own
Eppie
as
my
child
,
and
provide
for
her
.
She
is
my
*NL*
own
child
--
her
mother
was
my
wife
.
I
've
a
natural
claim
on
her
that
*NL*
must
stand
before
every
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eppie
had
given
a
violent
start
,
and
turned
quite
pale
.
Silas
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
who
had
been
relieved
,
by
Eppie
's
answer
,
from
the
dread
lest
*NL*
his
mind
should
be
in
opposition
to
hers
,
felt
the
spirit
of
resistance
*NL*
in
him
set
free
,
not
without
a
touch
of
parental
fierceness
.
``
Then
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
he
answered
,
with
an
accent
of
bitterness
that
had
been
silent
in
*NL*
him
since
the
memorable
day
when
his
youthful
hope
had
perished
--
``
then
,
*NL*
sir
,
why
did
n't
you
say
so
sixteen
year
ago
,
and
claim
her
before
I
'd
*NL*
come
to
love
her
,
i
`
stead
o
'
coming
to
take
her
from
me
now
,
when
you
*NL*
might
as
well
take
the
heart
out
o
'
my
body
?
God
gave
her
to
me
*NL*
because
you
turned
your
back
upon
her
,
and
He
looks
upon
her
as
mine
:
*NL*
you
've
no
right
to
her
!
When
a
man
turns
a
blessing
from
his
door
,
it
*NL*
falls
to
them
as
take
it
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
,
Marner
.
I
was
wrong
.
I
've
repented
of
my
conduct
in
*NL*
that
matter
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
who
could
not
help
feeling
the
edge
of
*NL*
Silas
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
,
sir
,
''
said
Marner
,
with
gathering
excitement
;
*NL*
``
but
repentance
does
n't
alter
what
's
been
going
on
for
sixteen
year
.
*NL*
Your
coming
now
and
saying
``
I
'm
her
father
''
does
n't
alter
the
feelings
*NL*
inside
us
.
It
's
me
she
's
been
calling
her
father
ever
since
she
could
*NL*
say
the
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
think
you
might
look
at
the
thing
more
reasonably
,
Marner
,
''
said
*NL*
Godfrey
,
unexpectedly
awed
by
the
weaver
's
direct
truth-speaking
.
``
It
*NL*
is
n't
as
if
she
was
to
be
taken
quite
away
from
you
,
so
that
you
'd
*NL*
never
see
her
again
.
She
'll
be
very
near
you
,
and
come
to
see
you
very
*NL*
often
.
She
'll
feel
just
the
same
towards
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
the
same
?
''
said
Marner
,
more
bitterly
than
ever
.
``
How
'll
she
*NL*
feel
just
the
same
for
me
as
she
does
now
,
when
we
eat
o
'
the
same
bit
,
*NL*
and
drink
o
'
the
same
cup
,
and
think
o
'
the
same
things
from
one
day
's
*NL*
end
to
another
?
Just
the
same
?
that
's
idle
talk
.
You
'd
cut
us
i
'
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
,
unqualified
by
experience
to
discern
the
pregnancy
of
Marner
's
*NL*
simple
words
,
felt
rather
angry
again
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
the
*NL*
weaver
was
very
selfish
-LRB-
a
judgment
readily
passed
by
those
who
have
*NL*
never
tested
their
own
power
of
sacrifice
-RRB-
to
oppose
what
was
*NL*
undoubtedly
for
Eppie
's
welfare
;
and
he
felt
himself
called
upon
,
for
*NL*
her
sake
,
to
assert
his
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
thought
,
Marner
,
''
he
said
,
severely
--
``
I
should
have
*NL*
thought
your
affection
for
Eppie
would
make
you
rejoice
in
what
was
for
*NL*
her
good
,
even
if
it
did
call
upon
you
to
give
up
something
.
You
ought
*NL*
to
remember
your
own
life
's
uncertain
,
and
she
's
at
an
age
now
when
her
*NL*
lot
may
soon
be
fixed
in
a
way
very
different
from
what
it
would
be
in
*NL*
her
father
's
home
:
she
may
marry
some
low
working-man
,
and
then
,
*NL*
whatever
I
might
do
for
her
,
I
could
n't
make
her
well-off
.
You
're
*NL*
putting
yourself
in
the
way
of
her
welfare
;
and
though
I
'm
sorry
to
*NL*
hurt
you
after
what
you
've
done
,
and
what
I
've
left
undone
,
I
feel
now
*NL*
it
's
my
duty
to
insist
on
taking
care
of
my
own
daughter
.
I
want
to
do
*NL*
my
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
it
were
Silas
or
Eppie
that
was
*NL*
more
deeply
stirred
by
this
last
speech
of
Godfrey
's
.
Thought
had
been
*NL*
very
busy
in
Eppie
as
she
listened
to
the
contest
between
her
old
*NL*
long-loved
father
and
this
new
unfamiliar
father
who
had
suddenly
come
*NL*
to
fill
the
place
of
that
black
featureless
shadow
which
had
held
the
*NL*
ring
and
placed
it
on
her
mother
's
finger
.
Her
imagination
had
darted
*NL*
backward
in
conjectures
,
and
forward
in
previsions
,
of
what
this
*NL*
revealed
fatherhood
implied
;
and
there
were
words
in
Godfrey
's
last
*NL*
speech
which
helped
to
make
the
previsions
especially
definite
.
Not
*NL*
that
these
thoughts
,
either
of
past
or
future
,
determined
her
*NL*
resolution
--
_
that
_
was
determined
by
the
feelings
which
vibrated
to
*NL*
every
word
Silas
had
uttered
;
but
they
raised
,
even
apart
from
these
*NL*
feelings
,
a
repulsion
towards
the
offered
lot
and
the
newly-revealed
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silas
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
again
stricken
in
conscience
,
and
alarmed
*NL*
lest
Godfrey
's
accusation
should
be
true
--
lest
he
should
be
raising
his
*NL*
own
will
as
an
obstacle
to
Eppie
's
good
.
For
many
moments
he
was
mute
,
*NL*
struggling
for
the
self-conquest
necessary
to
the
uttering
of
the
*NL*
difficult
words
.
They
came
out
tremulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
say
no
more
.
Let
it
be
as
you
will
.
Speak
to
the
child
.
I
'll
*NL*
hinder
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Nancy
,
with
all
the
acute
sensibility
of
her
own
affections
,
*NL*
shared
her
husband
's
view
,
that
Marner
was
not
justifiable
in
his
wish
*NL*
to
retain
Eppie
,
after
her
real
father
had
avowed
himself
.
She
felt
*NL*
that
it
was
a
very
hard
trial
for
the
poor
weaver
,
but
her
code
allowed
*NL*
no
question
that
a
father
by
blood
must
have
a
claim
above
that
of
any
*NL*
foster-father
.
Besides
,
Nancy
,
used
all
her
life
to
plenteous
*NL*
circumstances
and
the
privileges
of
``
respectability
''
,
could
not
enter
*NL*
into
the
pleasures
which
early
nurture
and
habit
connect
with
all
the
*NL*
little
aims
and
efforts
of
the
poor
who
are
born
poor
:
to
her
mind
,
*NL*
Eppie
,
in
being
restored
to
her
birthright
,
was
entering
on
a
too
long
*NL*
withheld
but
unquestionable
good
.
Hence
she
heard
Silas
's
last
words
*NL*
with
relief
,
and
thought
,
as
Godfrey
did
,
that
their
wish
was
achieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eppie
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
looking
at
his
daughter
,
not
without
*NL*
some
embarrassment
,
under
the
sense
that
she
was
old
enough
to
judge
*NL*
him
,
``
it
'll
always
be
our
wish
that
you
should
show
your
love
and
*NL*
gratitude
to
one
who
's
been
a
father
to
you
so
many
years
,
and
we
shall
*NL*
want
to
help
you
to
make
him
comfortable
in
every
way
.
But
we
hope
*NL*
you
'll
come
to
love
us
as
well
;
and
though
I
have
n't
been
what
a
father
*NL*
should
ha
'
been
to
you
all
these
years
,
I
wish
to
do
the
utmost
in
my
*NL*
power
for
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
,
and
provide
for
you
as
my
only
*NL*
child
.
And
you
'll
have
the
best
of
mothers
in
my
wife
--
that
'll
be
a
*NL*
blessing
you
have
n't
known
since
you
were
old
enough
to
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
you
'll
be
a
treasure
to
me
,
''
said
Nancy
,
in
her
gentle
voice
.
*NL*
``
We
shall
want
for
nothing
when
we
have
our
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eppie
did
not
come
forward
and
curtsy
,
as
she
had
done
before
.
She
*NL*
held
Silas
's
hand
in
hers
,
and
grasped
it
firmly
--
it
was
a
weaver
's
*NL*
hand
,
with
a
palm
and
finger-tips
that
were
sensitive
to
such
*NL*
pressure
--
while
she
spoke
with
colder
decision
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
ma'am
--
thank
you
,
sir
,
for
your
offers
--
they
're
very
great
,
*NL*
and
far
above
my
wish
.
For
I
should
have
no
delight
i
'
life
any
more
*NL*
if
I
was
forced
to
go
away
from
my
father
,
and
knew
he
was
sitting
at
*NL*
home
,
a-thinking
of
me
and
feeling
lone
.
We
've
been
used
to
be
happy
*NL*
together
every
day
,
and
I
ca
n't
think
o
'
no
happiness
without
him
.
And
*NL*
he
says
he
'd
nobody
i
'
the
world
till
I
was
sent
to
him
,
and
he
'd
have
*NL*
nothing
when
I
was
gone
.
And
he
's
took
care
of
me
and
loved
me
from
*NL*
the
first
,
and
I
'll
cleave
to
him
as
long
as
he
lives
,
and
nobody
shall
*NL*
ever
come
between
him
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
make
sure
,
Eppie
,
''
said
Silas
,
in
a
low
voice
--
``
you
must
*NL*
make
sure
as
you
wo
n't
ever
be
sorry
,
because
you
've
made
your
choice
*NL*
to
stay
among
poor
folks
,
and
with
poor
clothes
and
things
,
when
you
*NL*
might
ha
'
had
everything
o
'
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
sensitiveness
on
this
point
had
increased
as
he
listened
to
Eppie
's
*NL*
words
of
faithful
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
never
be
sorry
,
father
,
''
said
Eppie
.
``
I
should
n't
know
what
to
*NL*
think
on
or
to
wish
for
with
fine
things
about
me
,
as
I
have
n't
been
*NL*
used
to
.
And
it
`
ud
be
poor
work
for
me
to
put
on
things
,
and
ride
in
*NL*
a
gig
,
and
sit
in
a
place
at
church
,
as
`

make
them
as
I
'm
fond

think
me
unfitting
company
for

.
What
could
_
I
_
care
for
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
looked
at
Godfrey
with
a
pained
questioning
glance
.
But
his
eyes
*NL*
were
fixed
on
the
floor
,
where
he
was
moving
the
end
of
his
stick
,
as
*NL*
if
he
were
pondering
on
something
absently
.
She
thought
there
was
a
*NL*
word
which
might
perhaps
come
better
from
her
lips
than
from
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
say
is
natural
,
my
dear
child
--
it
's
natural
you
should
cling
*NL*
to
those
who
've
brought
you
up
,
''
she
said
,
mildly
;
``
but
there
's
a
duty
*NL*
you
owe
to
your
lawful
father
.
There
's
perhaps
something
to
be
given
*NL*
up
on
more
sides
than
one
.
When
your
father
opens
his
home
to
you
,
I
*NL*
think
it
's
right
you
should
n't
turn
your
back
on
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
feel
as
I
've
got
any
father
but
one
,
''
said
Eppie
,
impetuously
,
*NL*
while
the
tears
gathered
.
``
I
've
always
thought
of
a
little
home
where
*NL*
he
'd
sit
i
'
the
corner
,
and
I
should
fend
and
do
everything
for
him
:
I
*NL*
ca
n't
think
o

no
other
home

I
was
n't
brought
up
to
be
a
lady
,
and
I
*NL*
ca

turn
my
mind
to
it
.
I
like
the
working-folks
,
and
their
*NL*
victuals
,
and
their
ways
.
And
,
''
she
ended
passionately
,
while
the
*NL*
tears
fell
,
``
I
'm
promised
to
marry
a
working-man
,
as
'll
live
with

father
,
and
help
me
to
take
care
of
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
looked
up
at
Nancy
with
a
flushed
face
and
smarting
dilated
*NL*
eyes
.
This
frustration
of
a
purpose
towards
which
he
had
set
out
under
*NL*
the
exalted
consciousness
that
he
was
about
to
compensate
in
some
*NL*
degree
for
the
greatest
demerit
of
his
life
,
made
him
feel
the
air
of
*NL*
the
room
stifling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
''
he
said
,
in
an
under-tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
wo
n't
talk
of
this
any
longer
now

''
said
Nancy
,
rising
.
``
We
're
your
*NL*
well-wishers

my
dear

and
yours
too

We
shall
come
and
see
*NL*
you
again
.
It
's
getting
late
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
she
covered
her
husband
's
abrupt
departure
,
for
Godfrey
had
*NL*
gone
straight
to
the
door
,
unable
to
say
more

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
and
Godfrey
walked
home
under
the
starlight
in
silence
.
When
*NL*
they
entered
the
oaken
parlour
,
Godfrey
threw
himself
into
his
chair
,
*NL*
while
Nancy
laid
down
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
stood
on
the
hearth
*NL*
near
her
husband
,
unwilling
to
leave
him
even
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
*NL*
yet
fearing
to
utter
any
word
lest
it
might
jar
on
his
feeling
.
At
*NL*
last
Godfrey
turned
his
head
towards
her
,
and
their
eyes
met
,
dwelling
*NL*
in
that
meeting
without
any
movement
on
either
side
.
That
quiet
mutual
*NL*
gaze
of
a
trusting
husband
and
wife
is
like
the
first
moment
of
rest
or
*NL*
refuge
from
a
great
weariness
or
a
great
danger
--
not
to
be
interfered
*NL*
with
by
speech
or
action
which
would
distract
the
sensations
from
the
*NL*
fresh
enjoyment
of
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
presently
he
put
out
his
hand
,
and
as
Nancy
placed
hers
within
it
,
*NL*
he
drew
her
towards
him
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
ended
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bent
to
kiss
him
,
and
then
said
,
as
she
stood
by
his
side
,
``
Yes
,
*NL*
I
'm
afraid
we
must
give
up
the
hope
of
having
her
for
a
daughter
.
It
*NL*
would
n't
be
right
to
want
to
force
her
to
come
to
us
against
her
will
.
*NL*
We
ca
n't
alter
her
bringing
up
and
what
's
come
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Godfrey
,
with
a
keen
decisiveness
of
tone
,
in
contrast
with
*NL*
his
usually
careless
and
unemphatic
speech
--
``
there
's
debts
we
ca
n't
pay
*NL*
like
money
debts
,
by
paying
extra
for
the
years
that
have
slipped
by
.
*NL*
While
I
've
been
putting
off
and
putting
off
,
the
trees
have
been
*NL*
growing
--
it
's
too
late
now
.
Marner
was
in
the
right
in
what
he
said
*NL*
about
a
man
's
turning
away
a
blessing
from
his
door
:
it
falls
to
*NL*
somebody
else
.
I
wanted
to
pass
for
childless
once
,
Nancy
--
I
shall
*NL*
pass
for
childless
now
against
my
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
did
not
speak
immediately
,
but
after
a
little
while
she
*NL*
asked
--
``
You
wo
n't
make
it
known
,
then
,
about
Eppie
's
being
your
*NL*
daughter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
where
would
be
the
good
to
anybody
?
--
only
harm
.
I
must
do
what
I
*NL*
can
for
her
in
the
state
of
life
she
chooses
.
I
must
see
who
it
is
*NL*
she
's
thinking
of
marrying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
wo
n't
do
any
good
to
make
the
thing
known
,
''
said
Nancy
,
who
*NL*
thought
she
might
now
allow
herself
the
relief
of
entertaining
a
*NL*
feeling
which
she
had
tried
to
silence
before
,
``
I
should
be
very
*NL*
thankful
for
father
and
Priscilla
never
to
be
troubled
with
knowing
*NL*
what
was
done
in
the
past
,
more
than
about
Dunsey
:
it
ca
n't
be
helped
,
*NL*
their
knowing
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
put
it
in
my
will
--
I
think
I
shall
put
it
in
my
will
.
I
*NL*
should
n't
like
to
leave
anything
to
be
found
out
,
like
this
of
Dunsey
,
''
*NL*
said
Godfrey
,
meditatively
.
``
But
I
ca
n't
see
anything
but
difficulties
*NL*
that
`
ud
come
from
telling
it
now
.
I
must
do
what
I
can
to
make
her
*NL*
happy
in
her
own
way
.
I
've
a
notion
,
''
he
added
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
pause
,
``
it
's
Aaron
Winthrop
she
meant
she
was
engaged
to
.
I
remember
*NL*
seeing
him
with
her
and
Marner
going
away
from
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
's
very
sober
and
industrious
,
''
said
Nancy
,
trying
to
view
the
*NL*
matter
as
cheerfully
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Godfrey
fell
into
thoughtfulness
again
.
Presently
he
looked
up
at
*NL*
Nancy
sorrowfully
,
and
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
very
pretty
,
nice
girl
,
is
n't
she
,
Nancy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
;
and
with
just
your
hair
and
eyes
:
I
wondered
it
had
never
*NL*
struck
me
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
took
a
dislike
to
me
at
the
thought
of
my
being
her
*NL*
father
:
I
could
see
a
change
in
her
manner
after
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
could
n't
bear
to
think
of
not
looking
on
Marner
as
her
father
,
''
*NL*
said
Nancy
,
not
wishing
to
confirm
her
husband
's
painful
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
thinks
I
did
wrong
by
her
mother
as
well
as
by
her
.
She
thinks
me
*NL*
worse
than
I
am
.
But
she
_
must
_
think
it
:
she
can
never
know
all
.
*NL*
It
's
part
of
my
punishment
,
Nancy
,
for
my
daughter
to
dislike
me
.
I
*NL*
should
never
have
got
into
that
trouble
if
I
'd
been
true
to
you
--
if
I
*NL*
had
n't
been
a
fool
.
I
'd
no
right
to
expect
anything
but
evil
could
*NL*
come
of
that
marriage
--
and
when
I
shirked
doing
a
father
's
part
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
was
silent
:
her
spirit
of
rectitude
would
not
let
her
try
to
*NL*
soften
the
edge
of
what
she
felt
to
be
a
just
compunction
.
He
spoke
*NL*
again
after
a
little
while
,
but
the
tone
was
rather
changed
:
there
was
*NL*
tenderness
mingled
with
the
previous
self-reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
got
_
you
_
,
Nancy
,
in
spite
of
all
;
and
yet
I
've
been
grumbling
*NL*
and
uneasy
because
I
had
n't
something
else
--
as
if
I
deserved
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
never
been
wanting
to
me
,
Godfrey
,
''
said
Nancy
,
with
quiet
*NL*
sincerity
.
``
My
only
trouble
would
be
gone
if
you
resigned
yourself
to
*NL*
the
lot
that
's
been
given
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
it
is
n't
too
late
to
mend
a
bit
there
.
Though
it

too
late

some
things

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
when
Silas
and
Eppie
were
seated
at
their
breakfast
,
*NL*
he
said
to
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eppie
,
there
's
a
thing
I
've
had
on
my
mind
to
do
this
two
year
,
and
*NL*
now
the
money
's
been
brought
back
to
us
,
we
can
do
it
.
I
've
been
*NL*
turning
it
over
and
over
in
the
night
,
and
I
think
we
'll
set
out
*NL*
to-morrow
,
while
the
fine
days
last
.
We
'll
leave
the
house
and
*NL*
everything
for
your
godmother
to
take
care
on
,
and
we
'll
make
a
little
*NL*
bundle
o
'
things
and
set
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
to
go
,
daddy
?
''
said
Eppie
,
in
much
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
my
old
country
--
to
the
town
where
I
was
born
--
up
Lantern
Yard
.
I
*NL*
want
to
see
Mr.
Paston
,
the
minister
:
something
may
ha
'
come
out
to
*NL*
make
'em
know
I
was
innicent
o
'
the
robbery
.
And
Mr.
Paston
was
a
man
*NL*
with
a
deal
o
'
light
--
I
want
to
speak
to
him
about
the
drawing
o
'
the
*NL*
lots
.
And
I
should
like
to
talk
to
him
about
the
religion
o
'
this
*NL*
country-side
,
for
I
partly
think
he
does
n't
know
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eppie
was
very
joyful
,
for
there
was
the
prospect
not
only
of
wonder
*NL*
and
delight
at
seeing
a
strange
country
,
but
also
of
coming
back
to
*NL*
tell
Aaron
all
about
it
.
Aaron
was
so
much
wiser
than
she
was
about
*NL*
most
things
--
it
would
be
rather
pleasant
to
have
this
little
advantage
*NL*
over
him
.
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
though
possessed
with
a
dim
fear
of
dangers
*NL*
attendant
on
so
long
a
journey
,
and
requiring
many
assurances
that
it
*NL*
would
not
take
them
out
of
the
region
of
carriers
'
carts
and
slow
*NL*
waggons
,
was
nevertheless
well
pleased
that
Silas
should
revisit
his
*NL*
own
country
,
and
find
out
if
he
had
been
cleared
from
that
false
*NL*
accusation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
be
easier
in
your
mind
for
the
rest
o
'
your
life
,
Master
*NL*
Marner
,
''
said
Dolly
--
``
that
you
would
.
And
if
there
's
any
light
to
be
*NL*
got
up
the
yard
as
you
talk
on
,
we
've
need
of
it
i
'
this
world
,
and
I
'd
*NL*
be
glad
on
it
myself
,
if
you
could
bring
it
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
on
the
fourth
day
from
that
time
,
Silas
and
Eppie
,
in
their
Sunday
*NL*
clothes
,
with
a
small
bundle
tied
in
a
blue
linen
handkerchief
,
were
*NL*
making
their
way
through
the
streets
of
a
great
manufacturing
town
.
*NL*
Silas
,
bewildered
by
the
changes
thirty
years
had
brought
over
his
*NL*
native
place
,
had
stopped
several
persons
in
succession
to
ask
them
the
*NL*
name
of
this
town
,
that
he
might
be
sure
he
was
not
under
a
mistake
*NL*
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
for
Lantern
Yard
,
father
--
ask
this
gentleman
with
the
tassels
on
*NL*
his
shoulders
a-standing
at
the
shop
door
;
he
is
n't
in
a
hurry
like
the
*NL*
rest
,
''
said
Eppie
,
in
some
distress
at
her
father
's
bewilderment
,
and
*NL*
ill
at
ease
,
besides
,
amidst
the
noise
,
the
movement
,
and
the
multitude
*NL*
of
strange
indifferent
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
my
child
,
he
wo
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
''
said
Silas
;
*NL*
``
gentlefolks
did
n't
ever
go
up
the
Yard
.
But
happen
somebody
can
tell
*NL*
me
which
is
the
way
to
Prison
Street
,
where
the
jail
is
.
I
know
the
way
*NL*
out
o
'
that
as
if
I
'd
seen
it
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
some
difficulty
,
after
many
turnings
and
new
inquiries
,
they
*NL*
reached
Prison
Street
;
and
the
grim
walls
of
the
jail
,
the
first
object
*NL*
that
answered
to
any
image
in
Silas
's
memory
,
cheered
him
with
the
*NL*
certitude
,
which
no
assurance
of
the
town
's
name
had
hitherto
given
*NL*
him
,
that
he
was
in
his
native
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
he
said
,
drawing
a
long
breath
,
``
there
's
the
jail
,
Eppie
;
that
's
*NL*
just
the
same
:
I
are
n't
afraid
now
.
It
's
the
third
turning
on
the
left
*NL*
hand
from
the
jail
doors
--
that
's
the
way
we
must
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
dark
ugly
place
!
''
said
Eppie
.
``
How
it
hides
the
sky
!
*NL*
It
's
worse
than
the
Workhouse
.
I
'm
glad
you
do
n't
live
in
this
town
*NL*
now
,
father
.
Is
Lantern
Yard
like
this
street
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
precious
child
,
''
said
Silas
,
smiling
,
``
it
is
n't
a
big
street
like
*NL*
this
.
I
never
was
easy
i
'
this
street
myself
,
but
I
was
fond
o
'
*NL*
Lantern
Yard
.
The
shops
here
are
all
altered
,
I
think
--
I
ca
n't
make
*NL*
'em
out
;
but
I
shall
know
the
turning
,
because
it
's
the
third
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
satisfaction
,
as
they
came
to
a
*NL*
narrow
alley
.
``
And
then
we
must
go
to
the
left
again
,
and
then
*NL*
straight
for
`
ard
for
a
bit
,
up
Shoe
Lane
:
and
then
we
shall
be
at
the
*NL*
entry
next
to
the
o'erhanging
window
,
where
there
's
the
nick
in
the
*NL*
road
for
the
water
to
run
.
Eh
,
I
can
see
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
father
,
I
'm
like
as
if
I
was
stifled
,
''
said
Eppie
.
``
I
could
n't
ha
'
*NL*
thought
as
any
folks
lived
i
'
this
way
,
so
close
together
.
How
pretty
*NL*
the
Stone-pits
`
ull
look
when
we
get
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
comical
to
_
me
_
,
child
,
now
--
and
smells
bad
.
I
ca
n't
think
*NL*
as
it
usened
to
smell
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
and
there
a
sallow
,
begrimed
face
looked
out
from
a
gloomy
doorway
*NL*
at
the
strangers
,
and
increased
Eppie
's
uneasiness
,
so
that
it
was
a
*NL*
longed-for
relief
when
they
issued
from
the
alleys
into
Shoe
Lane
,
*NL*
where
there
was
a
broader
strip
of
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
heart
!
''
said
Silas
,
``
why
,
there
's
people
coming
out
o
'
the
Yard
*NL*
as
if
they
'd
been
to
chapel
at
this
time
o
'
day
--
a
weekday
noon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
started
and
stood
still
with
a
look
of
distressed
*NL*
amazement
,
that
alarmed
Eppie
.
They
were
before
an
opening
in
front
of
*NL*
a
large
factory
,
from
which
men
and
women
were
streaming
for
their
*NL*
midday
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
said
Eppie
,
clasping
his
arm
,
``
what
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
to
speak
again
and
again
before
Silas
could
answer
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
gone
,
child
,
''
he
said
,
at
last
,
in
strong
agitation
--
``
Lantern
*NL*
Yard
's
gone
.
It
must
ha
'
been
here
,
because
here
's
the
house
with
the
*NL*
o'erhanging
window
--
I
know
that
--
it
's
just
the
same
;
but
they
've
made
*NL*
this
new
opening
;
and
see
that
big
factory
!
It
's
all
gone
--
chapel
and
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
into
that
little
brush-shop
and
sit
down
,
father
--
they
'll
let
you
*NL*
sit
down

said
Eppie
,
always
on
the
watch
lest
one
of
her
father
's
*NL*
strange
attacks
should
come
on
.
``
Perhaps
the
people
can
tell
you
all
*NL*
about
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
neither
from
the
brush-maker
,
who
had
come
to
Shoe
Lane
only
ten
*NL*
years
ago
,
when
the
factory
was
already
built
,
nor
from
any
other
*NL*
source
within
his
reach
,
could
Silas
learn
anything
of
the
old
Lantern
*NL*
Yard
friends
,
or
of
Mr.
Paston
the
minister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
place
is
all
swep
'
away
,
''
Silas
said
to
Dolly
Winthrop
on
the
*NL*
night
of
his
return
--
``
the
little
graveyard
and
everything
.
The
old
*NL*
home
's
gone
;
I
've
no
home
but
this
now
.
I
shall
never
know
whether
*NL*
they
got
at
the
truth
o
'
the
robbery
,
nor
whether
Mr.
Paston
could
ha
'
*NL*
given
me
any
light
about
the
drawing
o
'
the
lots
.
It
's
dark
to
me
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Winthrop
,
that
is
;
I
doubt
it
'll
be
dark
to
the
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
Master
Marner
,
''
said
Dolly
,
who
sat
with
a
placid
listening
*NL*
face
,
now
bordered
by
grey
hairs
;
``
I
doubt
it
may
.
It
's
the
will
o
'
*NL*
Them
above
as
a
many
things
should
be
dark
to
us
;
but
there
's
some
*NL*
things
as
I
've
never
felt
i
'
the
dark
about
,
and
they
're
mostly
what
*NL*
comes
i
'
the
day
's
work
.
You
were
hard
done
by
that
once
,
Master
*NL*
Marner
,
and
it
seems
as
you
'll
never
know
the
rights
of
it
;
but
that
*NL*
does
n't
hinder
there
_
being
_
a
rights
,
Master
Marner
,
for
all
it
's
dark
*NL*
to
you
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Silas
,
``
no
;
that
does
n't
hinder
.
Since
the
time
the
child
*NL*
was
sent
to
me
and
I
've
come
to
love
her
as
myself
,
I
've
had
light
*NL*
enough
to
trusten
by
;
and
now
she
says
she
'll
never
leave
me
,
I
think
I
*NL*
shall
trusten
till
I
die
.

*NL*
CONCLUSION
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
time
of
the
year
which
was
held
in
Raveloe
to
be
*NL*
especially
suitable
for
a
wedding
.
It
was
when
the
great
lilacs
and
*NL*
laburnums
in
the
old-fashioned
gardens
showed
their
golden
and
purple
*NL*
wealth
above
the
lichen-tinted
walls
,
and
when
there
were
calves
still
*NL*
young
enough
to
want
bucketfuls
of
fragrant
milk
.
People
were
not
so
*NL*
busy
then
as
they
must
become
when
the
full
cheese-making
and
the
*NL*
mowing
had
set
in
;
and
besides
,
it
was
a
time
when
a
light
bridal
dress
*NL*
could
be
worn
with
comfort
and
seen
to
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
the
sunshine
fell
more
warmly
than
usual
on
the
lilac
tufts
the
*NL*
morning
that
Eppie
was
married
,
for
her
dress
was
a
very
light
one
.
*NL*
She
had
often
thought
,
though
with
a
feeling
of
renunciation
,
that
the
*NL*
perfection
of
a
wedding-dress
would
be
a
white
cotton
,
with
the
tiniest
*NL*
pink
sprig
at
wide
intervals
;
so
that
when
Mrs.
Godfrey
Cass
begged
to
*NL*
provide
one
,
and
asked
Eppie
to
choose
what
it
should
be
,
previous
*NL*
meditation
had
enabled
her
to
give
a
decided
answer
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seen
at
a
little
distance
as
she
walked
across
the
churchyard
and
down
*NL*
the
village
,
she
seemed
to
be
attired
in
pure
white
,
and
her
hair
*NL*
looked
like
the
dash
of
gold
on
a
lily
.
One
hand
was
on
her
husband
's
*NL*
arm
,
and
with
the
other
she
clasped
the
hand
of
her
father
Silas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
be
giving
me
away
,
father
,
''
she
had
said
before
they
went
to
*NL*
church
;
``
you
'll
only
be
taking
Aaron
to
be
a
son
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
Winthrop
walked
behind
with
her
husband
;
and
there
ended
the
*NL*
little
bridal
procession
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
many
eyes
to
look
at
it
,
and
Miss
Priscilla
Lammeter
was
*NL*
glad
that
she
and
her
father
had
happened
to
drive
up
to
the
door
of
*NL*
the
Red
House
just
in
time
to
see
this
pretty
sight
.
They
had
come
to
*NL*
keep
Nancy
company
to-day
,
because
Mr.
Cass
had
had
to
go
away
to
*NL*
Lytherley
,
for
special
reasons
.
That
seemed
to
be
a
pity
,
for
*NL*
otherwise
he
might
have
gone
,
as
Mr.
Crackenthorp
and
Mr.
Osgood
*NL*
certainly
would
,
to
look
on
at
the
wedding-feast
which
he
had
ordered
*NL*
at
the
Rainbow
,
naturally
feeling
a
great
interest
in
the
weaver
who
*NL*
had
been
wronged
by
one
of
his
own
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
ha
'
wished
Nancy
had
had
the
luck
to
find
a
child
like
that
*NL*
and
bring
her
up
,
''
said
Priscilla
to
her
father
,
as
they
sat
in
the
*NL*
gig
;
``
I
should
ha
'
had
something
young
to
think
of
then
,
besides
the
*NL*
lambs
and
the
calves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Lammeter
;
``
one
feels
that
as
one
gets
*NL*
older
.
Things
look
dim
to
old
folks
:
they
'd
need
have
some
young
eyes
*NL*
about
'em
,
to
let
'em
know
the
world
's
the
same
as
it
used
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
came
out
now
to
welcome
her
father
and
sister
;
and
the
wedding
*NL*
group
had
passed
on
beyond
the
Red
House
to
the
humbler
part
of
the
*NL*
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
Winthrop
was
the
first
to
divine
that
old
Mr.
Macey
,
who
had
been
*NL*
set
in
his
arm-chair
outside
his
own
door
,
would
expect
some
special
*NL*
notice
as
they
passed
,
since
he
was
too
old
to
be
at
the
wedding-feast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Macey
's
looking
for
a
word
from
us
,
''
said
Dolly
;
``
he
'll
be
hurt
if
*NL*
we
pass
him
and
say
nothing
--
and
him
so
racked
with
rheumatiz
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
turned
aside
to
shake
hands
with
the
old
man
.
He
had
looked
*NL*
forward
to
the
occasion
,
and
had
his
premeditated
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Master
Marner
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
voice
that
quavered
a
good
deal
,
*NL*
``
I
've
lived
to
see
my
words
come
true
.
I
was
the
first
to
say
there
*NL*
was
no
harm
in
you
,
though
your
looks
might
be
again
'
you
;
and
I
was
*NL*
the
first
to
say
you
'd
get
your
money
back
.
And
it
's
nothing
but
*NL*
rightful
as
you
should
.
And
I
'd
ha
'
said
the
``
Amens
''
,
and
willing
,
at
*NL*
the
holy
matrimony
;
but
Tookey
's
done
it
a
good
while
now
,
and
I
hope
*NL*
you
'll
have
none
the
worse
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
open
yard
before
the
Rainbow
the
party
of
guests
were
already
*NL*
assembled
,
though
it
was
still
nearly
an
hour
before
the
appointed
*NL*
feast
time
.
But
by
this
means
they
could
not
only
enjoy
the
slow
*NL*
advent
of
their
pleasure
;
they
had
also
ample
leisure
to
talk
of
Silas
*NL*
Marner
's
strange
history
,
and
arrive
by
due
degrees
at
the
conclusion
*NL*
that
he
had
brought
a
blessing
on
himself
by
acting
like
a
father
to
a
*NL*
lone
motherless
child
.
Even
the
farrier
did
not
negative
this
*NL*
sentiment
:
on
the
contrary
,
he
took
it
up
as
peculiarly
his
own
,
and
*NL*
invited
any
hardy
person
present
to
contradict
him
.
But
he
met
with
no
*NL*
contradiction
;
and
all
differences
among
the
company
were
merged
in
a
*NL*
general
agreement
with
Mr.
Snell
's
sentiment
,
that
when
a
man
had
*NL*
deserved
his
good
luck
,
it
was
the
part
of
his
neighbours
to
wish
him
*NL*
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
bridal
group
approached
,
a
hearty
cheer
was
raised
in
the
*NL*
Rainbow
yard
;
and
Ben
Winthrop
,
whose
jokes
had
retained
their
*NL*
acceptable
flavour
,
found
it
agreeable
to
turn
in
there
and
receive
*NL*
congratulations
;
not
requiring
the
proposed
interval
of
quiet
at
the
*NL*
Stone-pits
before
joining
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eppie
had
a
larger
garden
than
she
had
ever
expected
there
now
;
and
in
*NL*
other
ways
there
had
been
alterations
at
the
expense
of
Mr.
Cass
,
the
*NL*
landlord
,
to
suit
Silas
's
larger
family
.
For
he
and
Eppie
had
declared
*NL*
that
they
would
rather
stay
at
the
Stone-pits
than
go
to
any
new
home
.
*NL*
The
garden
was
fenced
with
stones
on
two
sides
,
but
in
front
there
was
*NL*
an
open
fence
,
through
which
the
flowers
shone
with
answering
gladness
,
*NL*
as
the
four
united
people
came
within
sight
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
father
,
''
said
Eppie
,
``
what
a
pretty
home
ours
is
!
I
think
nobody
*NL*
could
be
happier
than
we
are
.
